    Foreign Press Clippings

    This Road is Impassable
    Taking tax cuts as a way to stimulate economic growth will not produce any effect. On the contrary, tax cuts will only further exacerbate inflation. Rising prices are the result of government debt (excessive issuance of banknotes).
    Since 1939, government debt has increased by 580%, while the cost of living has risen by 121%. Implementing tax cuts under increasingly large government expenditures will only worsen the situation.
      -- American "Cincinnati Post"

    Enforcing the Law While Violating It
    Socialist Party member Michiko Fujiwara criticized: "At a time when the prohibition of prostitution law is being implemented, it is incomprehensible that the Prime Minister (note: referring to Nobusuke Kishi) is inviting geishas to entertain foreign guests in Akasaka." It cannot be said that Fujiwara's opinion is merely out of a "lady's" particularly narrow-minded fastidiousness.
    In ancient times, Korea had so-called "official courtesans." The geishas at the Prime Minister's banquet for foreign guests are precisely this kind of "official courtesan."

    采取减税的办法来刺激经济上升，是不会产生什么效果的。相反地，减税只能进一步加剧通货膨胀。物价上涨是政府债务（滥发钞票）造成的恶果。
    自从1939年以来，政府债务增加了580％，而生活费用上涨了121％。在日益庞大的政府开支下实行减税，唯有促使情况更为恶化而已。

    执法犯法
    社会党的藤原道子责难说：“在现在实施禁止卖淫法的时候，首相（按：指岸信介）却在赤坂邀艺妓招待外宾，这实在使人莫名其妙。”不能说藤原的这种意见只是出于“女士”特有的量窄的洁癖。
    古时，朝鲜有所谓“官妓”。首相欢宴外宾席上的艺妓，也正是这种“官妓”之类吧。
