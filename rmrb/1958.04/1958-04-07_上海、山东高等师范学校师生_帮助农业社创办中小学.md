Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Teachers and students from three higher normal schools in Shanghai have gone deep into the suburbs of Shanghai and, in five days, assisted agricultural cooperatives in establishing a total of 223 agricultural middle schools, farmer's spare-time middle schools, agricultural technology night schools, community-run primary schools, and kindergartens.

Teachers and students from East China Normal University and Shanghai First and Second Normal Colleges recently conducted a major debate on how higher normal education should be oriented towards middle schools and production, criticizing ideological styles that belittle middle school teaching practice and production practice. Currently, more than 1,000 teachers and students from these three schools are assisting agricultural cooperatives in running schools.

East China Normal University and other schools have decided to use assisting agricultural cooperatives in running schools as the content of these students' educational practice courses. Teachers and students also participated in teaching work and began to vigorously compile teaching materials and train transferred cadres and high school graduates as teachers for farmer schools, so that after a month of educational practice, the teaching work of these schools can continue as usual.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan. Teachers and students of Shandong Normal College have decided to take turns going to the countryside to establish agricultural middle schools. Responsible cadres from relevant departments of the college have gone to Heze and Linyi Special Zones to prepare for running schools.

After studying Comrade Lu Dingyi's speech at the Jiangsu Community-Run Agricultural Middle School Symposium, all teachers and students of Shandong Normal College were deeply educated and inspired. The graduating students took the lead in posting big-character posters and letters of determination, requesting to go to the countryside to establish agricultural middle schools. This initiative quickly received enthusiastic responses from all students.

The leaders of Shandong Normal College adopted this initiative and decided that all teachers and students of the college should take turns going to the countryside to establish agricultural middle schools, believing that this is the beginning of a major reform of the college's educational policy and teaching policy, and it has found an important way to cultivate revolutionary educational workers who are both red and expert.

    上海、山东高等师范学校师生
    帮助农业社创办中小学
    据新华社上海讯　上海三所高等师范学校教师和学生深入上海近郊，五天内协助农业社创办了农业中学、农民业余中学、农业技术夜校、民办小学和幼儿园共二百二十三所。
    华东师范大学、上海第一、第二师范学院的教师和学生们，最近曾就高等师范教育如何面向中学、面向生产的问题开展了一场大争大辩，批判了轻视中小学教学实践和生产实践的思想作风。目前这三个学校已有一千多名师生在农业社协助办学。
    华东师范大学等校已决定以协助农业社办学作为这些学生教育实习课的内容。师生们还参加了教学工作，并着手大力编写教材，培养训练下放干部和高中毕业生作为农民学校的师资，以便在一个月的教育实习结束后，这些学校的教学工作能够照常进行。
    据新华社济南讯　山东师范学院师生决定轮流下乡兴办农业中学。学院有关部门的负责干部已分赴菏泽、临沂专区进行办学准备工作。
    山东师范学院全体师生在学习陆定一同志在江苏民办农业中学座谈会上的讲话以后，受到了深刻的教育和启发。应届毕业生首先贴出大字报和决心书，要求到农村去兴办农业中学。这一倡议，迅速得到全体学生的热烈响应。
    山东师范学院领导上采纳了这一倡议，决定全院师生轮流下乡兴办农业中学，并认为这是学院教育方针、教学方针的一个重大改革的开始，它为培养又红又专的革命教育工作人员找到了重要门路。
