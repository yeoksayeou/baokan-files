Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 30th (TASS dispatch): The Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held a meeting in Geneva on March 29th and 30th. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution on the 29th stating that a top-level conference must be convened to ease international tensions. The resolution passed by the council, jointly proposed by the delegations of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, was based on the original proposal of the Soviet delegation.

The resolution stated: The Inter-Parliamentary Union, noting the urgent need to eliminate the threat of a new war and improve the prospects for lasting peace, wholeheartedly supports the proposal to convene a top-level conference after appropriate preparations, and calls on the parliaments of all countries to take all necessary measures to facilitate the early convening of the top-level conference.

On the same day, the meeting also discussed the issue of admitting the Mongolian People's Republic as a member of the Union. The representatives of the United States and West Germany attempted to cast doubt on the resolution already passed by the Executive Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to admit the Mongolian People's Republic as a member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Soviet representative Paletskis said that the Mongolian People's Republic meets the requirements of the Inter-Parliamentary Union's charter, and therefore, for the Council to deny the Executive Committee's resolution on this issue would essentially damage the Executive Committee's reputation. Representatives from Ceylon, Czechoslovakia, Albania, and other countries also supported the legitimate rights of the Mongolian People's Republic. However, the Council ultimately passed the proposal of the American representative: the discussion of this issue would be postponed until "more detailed information" about the Mongolian People's Republic was obtained.

Other bodies of the Inter-Parliamentary Union also held meetings. The Disarmament Committee passed a resolution on consolidating peace, which was drafted based on the proposals of the Soviet and British delegations. This resolution will be submitted to the 47th session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union to be held in Rio de Janeiro this July for discussion. The resolution stated: The continued accumulation of atomic and conventional armaments, as well as the testing of nuclear weapons, poses a great threat to security and peace and causes deep anxiety among the people of all countries. Therefore, the Inter-Parliamentary Union calls on the parliaments of all member states to persistently advise their governments to take action as soon as possible to resume disarmament negotiations, preferably within the framework of the United Nations. The proposal stated that one of the urgent goals of this negotiation would be to ensure the immediate cessation of thermonuclear weapons testing and the establishment of corresponding international supervision.

The Council adopted the proposal of the Polish delegation and decided that the 48th session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 1959 would be held in Warsaw. The 49th session in 1960 will be held in Tokyo.

    各国议会联盟理事会会议决议
    必须早日召开最高级会议
    新华社31日电　据塔斯社日内瓦30日讯：各国议会联盟理事会3月29日和30日在日内瓦举行会议。会议在29日一致通过了一项决议：必须召开最高级会议，以缓和国际紧张局势。理事会通过的这项由苏、美、英、法四国代表团联合提出的决议案是以苏联代表团原先提出的建议为基础的。
    决议中说：各国议会联盟注意到迫切需要消除新战争的威胁和改善持久和平的前景，衷心支持在经过适当的准备以后召开最高级会议的这一主张，并且号召各国议会采取一切必要的措施来促成最高级会议的早日召开。
    同一天会议上还讨论了接纳蒙古人民共和国为联盟成员的问题。美国和西德的代表企图使大家对各国议会联盟执行委员会已经通过的接纳蒙古人民共和国为各国议会联盟成员的决议发生怀疑。苏联代表帕列茨基斯说，蒙古人民共和国符合各国议会联盟章程的要求，因此在理事会否认执行委员会关于这一问题的决议实际上等于破坏执行委员会的名誉。锡兰、捷克斯洛伐克、阿尔巴尼亚和其他国家的代表也支持蒙古人民共和国的合法权利。但是理事会最后仍然通过了美国代表的建议：关于这个问题要等到获得关于蒙古人民共和国的“更加详尽的情报”后，再行讨论。
    各国议会联盟的其他各机构也举行了会议。裁减军备委员会通过了关于巩固和平的决议，这个决议是根据苏联和英国代表团的建议拟定的，这个决议将提交今年7月在里约热内卢举行的各国议会联盟第四十七届会议讨论。决议中说：继续积累原子军备和常规军备以及试验核武器，是对安全与和平的巨大威胁，并且引起各国人民的深刻不安，为此，各国议会联盟号召一切成员国的议会坚持不懈地建议本国政府尽快地采取行动，来恢复裁军谈判，最好在联合国范围内。提案说，这个谈判的迫切目的之一将是保证立即停止热核武器的试验，并建立相应的国际监督。
    理事会采纳了波兰代表团的建议，决定1959年各国议会联盟第四十八届会议在华沙举行。1960年第四十九届会议将在东京举行。
