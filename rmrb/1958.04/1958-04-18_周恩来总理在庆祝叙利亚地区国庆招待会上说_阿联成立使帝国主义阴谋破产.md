Xinhua News Agency, April 17th: Today (April 17th) is the twelfth anniversary of the National Day of the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic. The Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the United Arab Republic in China, Mr. Shebini, held a celebration reception in the evening.

In his congratulatory speech at the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai said: "For the past twelve years, the Syrian people have been constantly subjected to colonialist aggression and threats. The heroic Egyptian people have been at the forefront of the anti-colonialist struggle alongside the Syrian people. The fighting friendship and the common destiny of the Arab nations have closely united Syria and Egypt. The establishment of the United Arab Republic has foiled the imperialist conspiracy to isolate Egypt or Syria."

Premier Zhou said: "The 27 million people of the United Arab Republic are a powerful force against colonialism and in defense of national independence. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported, and will always sympathize with and support, the struggle of the Arab peoples against colonialism. The Chinese people firmly believe that as long as the Arab peoples unite and persevere in their struggle, any imperialist aggression and subversion are bound to fail."

Premier Zhou said: "The relations between China and Egypt are friendly. Similarly, the relations between China and Syria are also friendly." "Since Egypt and Syria established the United Arab Republic, the relations between China and the Arab countries have been further developed on the basis of the friendly relations between China and Egypt and between China and Syria. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference are the guiding principles for the development and consolidation of friendly relations between our two countries. As everyone remembers, President Nasser had a friendly meeting with the Chinese government delegation during the Bandung Conference, which laid a good foundation for the development of friendly relations between the Chinese people and the Arab peoples in recent years. The Chinese people are willing to work together with the people of the United Arab Republic to further develop this friendly relationship."

At the beginning of the reception, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Shebini spoke. He said: "We are particularly pleased to celebrate this National Day in China and at the Embassy of the United Arab Republic for the first time after the completion of the merger of the two brotherly republics of Egypt and Syria. This merger was only achieved after our two brotherly countries made fruitful efforts and paid huge sacrifices to achieve unity in order to oppose the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and colonialism."

He said: "Since it was occupied in 1920, Syria has been a graveyard for invaders. Although Syria has suffered for a long time from foreign rule, it has persisted in its struggle against colonialism, which ended victoriously on April 17, 1946, with the withdrawal of all foreign troops."

He said: "We are very proud to see Syria's resistance to imperialist conspiracies when foreign troops were gathered on the Syrian-Turkish and Syrian-Israeli borders last year. The whole world admires the struggle of the great Syrian people to restore national freedom and safeguard national dignity. Their determination in the struggle has won the praise of peace-loving countries all over the world, especially the great Chinese people who firmly support the Arab cause."

He said: "The People's Republic of China is one of the earliest and most powerful supporters of Syria and Egypt, and has consistently and publicly condemned the continuous conspiracies of aggression. This support is one of the most important factors for the victory of the free Arab countries, and it will bring freedom to the Algerian people who are waging a life-and-death struggle against colonialism."

He said: "We sincerely hope that the growing friendship between the United Arab Republic and the People's Republic of China will continue to flourish, for the benefit of humanity, human happiness, world peace, and the cause of peaceful coexistence among nations."

Shebini concluded: "The most important goal of the United Arab Republic is to resist the exploitation and imperialism that have caused us so much suffering in the past. We Arab people believe that all international disputes can be resolved through peaceful consultations, without resorting to force, and firmly believe that military treaties are not the appropriate way to solve these problems."

Among the hundreds of guests of the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim were Li Jishen and Guo Moruo, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council; Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council; Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; as well as people from all walks of life in China and diplomatic envoys of various countries to China.

The reception lasted for an hour and a half.

    周恩来总理在庆祝叙利亚地区国庆招待会上说
    阿联成立使帝国主义阴谋破产
    新华社17日讯　今天（17日）是阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区十二周年国庆日，阿拉伯联合共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办谢宾尼在晚间举行了庆祝招待会。
    周恩来总理在招待会上的祝贺讲话中说：“十二年以来，叙利亚人民不断地遭受殖民主义的侵略威胁，同叙利亚人民一道进行反殖民主义斗争的，首先就是英雄的埃及人民。战斗的友谊和阿拉伯民族的共同命运，使叙利亚和埃及紧密地团结起来了。阿拉伯联合共和国的成立，使帝国主义孤立埃及或者叙利亚的阴谋破产了。”
    周总理说：“阿拉伯联合共和国的二千七百万人民是一支反对殖民主义、维护民族独立的强大力量。中国人民一向是并且永远是同情和支持阿拉伯各国人民反对殖民主义的斗争的。中国人民坚决相信，只要阿拉伯各国人民团结起来，坚持斗争，任何帝国主义的侵略阴谋和颠覆活动都是一定要失败的。”
    周总理说：“中国和埃及的关系是友好的。同样，中国和叙利亚的关系也是友好的。”“自从埃及和叙利亚建立阿拉伯联合共和国以后，中阿两国的关系又在中埃和中叙的友好关系的基础上有了进一步发展。和平共处五项原则和万隆会议的精神是我们两国发展和巩固友好关系的指导原则。大家还记得，在万隆会议期间纳赛尔总统同中国政府代表团进行了友好的会晤，这就为近几年来中国人民同阿拉伯各国人民发展友好关系作出了良好的开端。中国人民愿意同阿拉伯联合共和国人民一道为进一步发展这一友好关系而共同努力。”
    在招待会开始的时候，谢宾尼临时代办讲了话。他说：“我们是在埃及和叙利亚两个兄弟共和国完成合并以后第一次在中国和在阿拉伯联合共和国大使馆庆祝这个国庆日，感到特别高兴。这个合并，只是在我们两个兄弟国家为了达到团结来反对帝国主义和殖民主义的阴谋诡计而作出有成效的努力和付出巨大的牺牲之后才获得实现的。”
    他说：“从1920年它被占领时起，叙利亚一直是侵略者的葬身地。虽然叙利亚过去长期受着外国统治的痛苦，但是它坚持了反对殖民主义的斗争，这个斗争在1946年4月17日以所有外国军队的撤出而胜利结束。”
    他说：“我们非常自豪地看到去年外国军队集结在叙、土和叙、以边境时，叙利亚对帝国主义阴谋所进行的反抗。全世界都表示钦佩伟大的叙利亚人民为了恢复民族自由、维护民族尊严而进行的斗争，他们的斗争决心博得了全世界爱好和平国家的赞扬，特别是博得了坚决支持阿拉伯事业的伟大的中国人民的赞扬。”
    他说：“中华人民共和国是叙利亚和埃及最先和最有力的支持者之一，它一贯地公开谴责连续不断的侵略阴谋。这种支持是自由的阿拉伯国家之所以能够获得胜利的最重要的因素之一，它并将为正在进行反殖民主义的生死存亡斗争的阿尔及利亚人民带来自由。”
    他说：“我们衷心希望阿拉伯联合共和国和中华人民共和国之间不断增长的友谊将继续日益繁荣，以利于人道、人类幸福、世界和平和各国间和平共处的事业。”
    谢宾尼最后说：“阿拉伯联合共和国最主要的目标就是抵御在过去使我们深受苦难的剥削和帝国主义。我们阿拉伯人民相信，国际间的一切分歧都能够用和平协商的方法来解决，毋须诉诸武力，而且坚信，军事条约并不是解决这些问题的适当的方法。”
    在临时代办的几百名客人中，有人大常委会副委员长李济深、郭沫若，国务院副总理李先念，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中，外交部副部长章汉夫，以及中国各方面的人士和各国驻华使节。
    招待会共进行了一个半小时。
