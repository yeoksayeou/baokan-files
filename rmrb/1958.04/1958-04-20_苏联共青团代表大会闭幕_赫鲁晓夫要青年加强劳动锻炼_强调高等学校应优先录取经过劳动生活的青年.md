Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 19th (TASS): The 13th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, which lasted for four days, closed here on the 18th. In a resolution unanimously adopted, the congress considered the political line of the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol to be correct and approved of its practical activities.

The congress also unanimously adopted resolutions on the summary report of the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol, on partial amendments to the League's constitution, and on the summary report of the Central Auditing Commission, and elected the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission.

The congress also passed a letter to Komsomol members and youth across the country on preparations for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Komsomol, and sent a letter of tribute to the Central Committee of the CPSU.

In a speech at the meeting, Komsomol Central Committee Secretary S.P. Pavlov pointed out that this congress summarized the activities of the Komsomol over the past four years and formulated a combat program for the future.

Entrusted by the presidium of the congress, S.P. Pavlov suggested that, according to the old traditions of the Komsomol, those who have devoted themselves to the construction of the Komsomol and the education of youth for many years should be warmly sent off to new jobs, and that outstanding comrades among them should be elected as honorary members of the Komsomol. These include S.P. Pavlov, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the League, who is about to take up new Party work, and N.A. Mikhailov, the former Secretary of the Central Committee of the League and current Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union.

N.S. Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, spoke at the meeting that day. He wished all Soviet youth new achievements in various labors.

Khrushchev said that an important task at present is to enable all young workers and collective farm youth to have a secondary education. He emphasized that students in middle schools should cultivate a love for various productive labors. He said that students should know that labor is sacred and necessary everywhere. The idea that middle schools are only for training students to enter institutions of higher learning is wrong.

Khrushchev pointed out that the current college enrollment system needs to be revised. Young people who already have life experience, have undergone some labor training, and love the major they want to pursue should enjoy priority.

He also pointed out that more night schools for young workers must be opened, and those who graduate from these night schools can go to colleges and universities to study. If a person can study while working and shows perseverance and diligence, they should be given preferential treatment so that they can have more time to study. He said that in selecting these people, not only should their talents be taken into account, but also their enthusiasm for social activities.

When talking about the current international situation, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union advocates peaceful coexistence, advocates that people of all countries live peacefully, conduct extensive trade, and carry out cultural and sports exchanges.

On the same day, the Central Committee elected by the congress held its first plenary session and elected the Central Standing Committee composed of seventeen members. S.P. Pavlov was elected First Secretary of the Central Committee. At the plenary session of the Central Auditing Commission, A.M. Temnikov was elected Chairman.

    苏联共青团代表大会闭幕
    赫鲁晓夫要青年加强劳动锻炼
    强调高等学校应优先录取经过劳动生活的青年
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：历时四天的苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十三次代表大会18日在这里闭幕。大会在一致通过的决议中认为，苏联共青团中央的政治路线是正确的，并且赞同它的实际活动。
    大会还一致通过了关于苏联共青团中央总结报告、关于部分修改团章和关于中央检查委员会总结报告的决议，并且选出了中央委员会和中央检查委员会。
    大会还就筹备庆祝共青团成立四十周年通过了致全国男女共青团员和青年书，并且给苏共中央发出了致敬的信。
    共青团中央书记谢米恰斯内伊在会上讲话中指出，这次代表大会总结了四年来共青团的活动，并且拟订了今后的战斗纲领。
    谢米恰斯内伊受大会主席团的委托，建议按照共青团的老规矩热情欢送那些多年来献身于共青团的建设和青年教育的人走上新的工作岗位，并且选举其中优秀的同志为共青团的名誉团员。这些人当中包括即将卸任改作党的工作的团中央第一书记谢列平和前任团中央书记、现任苏联文化部长米哈伊洛夫。
    苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在这一天的会议上讲了话。他祝全体苏联青年在各种劳动中取得新的成就。
    赫鲁晓夫说，当前的一项重要任务是要使全体青年工人和集体农庄青年庄员具有中等教育水平。他强调指出，在中学里应当培养学生热爱各种生产劳动的感情。他说，学生们应当知道，劳动到处都是神圣的，必要的。那种以为中学只是为了培养升入高等学校学习的学生的想法是错误的。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，现在的高等学校招生制度需要加以修改。应当让那些已经有生活经验、经过某种劳动锻炼并且喜爱他们想进修的专业的青年享受优先权。
    他还指出，必须开办更多的青工夜校，在这些夜校里毕业的人可以到高等学校里学习。如果一个人能够一边学习一边工作，并且表现得顽强勤劳，那末就应该给以优待，让他们有可能用更多的时间来学习。他说，在挑选这些人的时候，不仅应该考虑到他们的才能，而且也应该考虑到他们的社会活动的积极性。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到目前的国际局势时说，苏联主张和平共处，主张各国人民和平地生活，进行广泛的贸易，实行文化和体育交流。
    同一天，大会选出的中央委员会举行了第一次全体会议，选出了由十七人组成的中央常务委员会。谢米恰斯内伊当选为中央委员会第一书记。在中央检查委员会全体会议上，捷姆尼科夫当选为主席。
