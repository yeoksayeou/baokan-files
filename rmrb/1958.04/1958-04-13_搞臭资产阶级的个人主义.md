    Thoroughly Discredit Bourgeois Individualism
    The Two-Anti movement in intellectual circles has already formed into a movement striving for redness and expertise. This is essential. If intellectuals do not become both red and expert, our technological revolution and cultural revolution cannot be realized. However, to achieve both redness and expertise, ideological obstacles must be overcome. And the biggest ideological obstacle is bourgeois individualism. Because in our country, the change of ownership is still recent, and the influence of bourgeois individualism is still very serious. Even among Communist Party members, this kind of thinking exists. This movement is the same for both Communist Party members and non-Communist Party members. It is not a question of who is educating whom, but that everyone should carry out self-education and educate others.
    Currently, bourgeois individualist thought is still seriously binding many intellectuals. Those deceptive slogans like "science for the sake of science," "art for the sake of art," "individual freedom," "aloofness," "striving to become a world-renowned scientist," "one book," and various other slogans abound. These slogans have a very strong anesthetic effect. Under these various slogans, intellectuals are self-intoxicated. It anesthetizes themselves and also anesthetizes the younger generation. The calls of the Party and the government, and the previous political movements, have awakened these anesthetized people, and some of them have indeed awakened. However, most people are still intoxicated to varying degrees. Bourgeois individualist thought still has an audience and some market in many places. Since the Two-Anti movement, bourgeois individualist thought has been burned by the flames of big-character posters. This is a "deterrent blow" to bourgeois individualist thought, knocking down its arrogance, which is necessary. However, to solve ideological problems more thoroughly, in-depth and meticulous discussions, heart-to-heart talks, and debates are still needed. Because bourgeois individualist thought has accumulated over many years, it is deeply rooted, systematic, and stubbornly occupies the minds of many people. It makes many intellectuals completely imbued with the concept of personal fame and gain, from dealing with people to academic thought. Without a meticulous attitude of presenting facts, reasoning, and repeatedly analyzing criticism, it is impossible to thoroughly discredit bourgeois individualist thought.
    Bourgeois individualist thought is indeed extremely臭 (chòu - stinky, foul). Some teachers, in order to earn a few hundred yuan more in royalties and gain a little fame, put their main energy into writing and translating manuscripts, but are perfunctory about the teaching tasks assigned to them by the state. They allow hundreds of socialist successors to waste their good time and fail to gain real knowledge in school. Some people, in order to get more money, often produce shoddy and incoherent manuscripts in their translations and writings, and spread many poisonous ideas to the vast number of readers through their writing and translating. Even more seriously, they themselves have shallow knowledge and cannot produce anything famous, but they pretend to be scholars and experts, piecing things together behind their backs and engaging in theft! This is what intellectuals do under the guidance of bourgeois individualist thought. There are still quite a few people doing this kind of thing.
    Some intellectuals already have a certain reputation, and the salary the state gives them is already quite high. However, they continue to pursue higher fame and more profit. They ignore the important problems in production that the state assigns to them to solve urgently. Even if they agree to some, they are half-hearted and perfunctory. They also regard a part of the young people they lead as tumors on their road to advancement, and do not give serious guidance, letting the young people explore on their own. They even keep knowledge to themselves, hide materials, and monopolize theoretical books, while directing young people to find materials and collect data for their personal research.
    The manifestations of bourgeois individualism among intellectuals are various, but the fundamental issue is to proceed from personal fame and gain, regardless of the interests of the state and the collective. Under the control of this thought, they only want to obtain the greatest personal benefit with the least amount of labor. When this thought develops to a serious level, they can do anything by speculation and trickery.
    Bourgeois individualist thought is seriously hindering the advancement of our country's scientific, technological, cultural, and educational undertakings. It is impossible to talk to these people about correct academic thought. If you talk about linking with reality, he thinks that solving a practical problem is much more difficult than his so-called thesis, so of course he won't do it. If you talk about cultivating young people, he feels that "the younger generation is to be feared," and he will not teach young people real skills. If you talk about valuing the present over the past, he wants to talk about the past to show his erudition, and he can also copy and paste from east to west. Talking about the present requires real skills and is prone to failure, so he simply dare not do it. If you talk about collective collaboration, he wants to monopolize fame and gain, so of course he cannot accept this request. If you talk about obeying the needs of the state, he only has small personal fame and gain in his mind, not the great fame and gain of the country, so how can he obey the needs of the state?
    Under the control of bourgeois individualist thought, academic research is carried out according to personal small plans, piecemeal, without a plan or focus. It is like a person without a spine, maybe one finger grows very well, but the whole person cannot stand up. Socialist society cannot rely on such people to develop economic and cultural undertakings.
    The problem is very clear: the serious and ugly thought of bourgeois individualism is hindering the progress of many intellectuals. It hinders the development of academia and hinders the advancement of national construction. To completely expose the ugly face of bourgeois individualism, to completely reveal all kinds of manifestations of bourgeois individualism, to thoroughly discredit it, and to thoroughly burn it through, the dirty and臭 (chòu - stinky, foul) essence of bourgeois individualism must be placed in broad daylight, so that this strong臭 (chòu - stinky, foul) smell will make anyone cover their noses and walk away. Only in this way will those who are麻醉 (má zuì - anaesthetized) by bourgeois individualist thought wake up.
    In this raging fire of the Two-Anti movement, we must raise the red flag in the ideological field. Our scientists must speak the truth, whether it is correct or incorrect, whether it is dissatisfaction or complaint, say whatever you have to say. Only when everyone dares to dig out all their thoughts can people have a deeper understanding of each other, can they carry out deeper criticism and self-criticism, so as to burn through bourgeois individualist thought, solve people's ideological problems, and make everyone pass the socialist stage easily and happily. The purpose of doing this is to thoroughly discredit bourgeois individualist thought, not to discredit or beat to death everyone who has this kind of thought, but to use the attitude of treating illnesses and saving people to awaken them. Doing this is not to randomly put on hats, but to meticulously present facts, reason, and carry out serious criticism and self-criticism, so that people can realize the harm of bourgeois individualist thought to the cause of national construction, so that more people can receive truly beneficial education.

### 搞臭资产阶级的个人主义

    搞臭资产阶级的个人主义
    双反运动在知识界已经形成争取红透专深的运动了，这是必需的。如果知识分子不红透专深，我国的技术革命、文化革命就不能实现。但是，要做到红透专深，必须破除思想障碍。而最大的思想障碍就是资产阶级的个人主义。因为在我国所有制改变还不久，资产阶级的个人主义思想影响还很严重，即使在共产党员之中，也存在着这种思想。这个运动对于共产党员或者非共产党员都是一样的，这不是谁来教育谁的问题，而是每一个人都应当进行自我教育，并且教育别人。
    目前，资产阶级个人主义思想还严重地束缚着许多知识分子。那些骗人的“为科学而科学”啦，“为艺术而艺术”啦，“个人自由”啦，“清高”啦，“力争成为世界闻名的科学家”啦，“一本书”啦，各种口号不一而足。这些口号带着很浓烈的麻醉作用。在这种种口号之下，知识分子自我陶醉了，它麻醉了自己，又麻醉了青年一代。党和政府的号召，历次的政治运动，对这些麻醉了的人们来说，曾清醒一下，有一部分人确实清醒了过来。但是大多数人，在不同程度上还在陶醉着。资产阶级个人主义思想在许多地方，还有唱有和，还有一些市场。双反运动以来，资产阶级个人主义思想受到了大字报烈火的燃烧。这是给资产阶级个人主义思想来了一顿“杀威棒”，把威风打了下来，这是必要的。但是要比较彻底地解决思想问题，还有待于深入细致的座谈、交心、辩论。因为资产阶级个人主义思想是长年累月集成的，它根深蒂固，有系统，有体系，顽固地占领着许多人的头脑。它使许多知识分子，从待人接物直到学术思想，完全贯串着个人名利观念。没有细致的摆事实、讲道理、反复分析的批判态度，就不能把资产阶级个人主义思想彻底搞臭。
    资产阶级个人主义思想确实是极臭的。有的教师，为了个人多拿几百元的稿费，出点小名气，把主要精力放在写稿译稿上，对国家交给他的教学任务却敷衍了事。让成百的社会主义接班人，浪费掉大好时光，在学校里得不到真才实学。有些人为了多拿到几个钱，他们所译所写的稿子往往粗制滥造，文理不通，并且把许多有毒的思想通过自己的写稿译稿，流传到广大读者中去。还有更严重的，他们自己学识浅薄，搞不出什么名堂来，却自己装作学者专家，背地里东拼西凑，干些个偷窃勾当！这就是知识分子在资产阶级个人主义思想的指导下干出来的事。干这种事的，目前还不在少数。
    有的知识分子，已经有了一定的名，国家给他的工资已经很不低。他们却继续追求更高的名，更多的利。他对国家交给他的生产上立待解决的重要问题，弃之不顾。即使应承了一些，也是三心二意，敷衍塞责。他对自己所领导的一部分青年人，也看作是自己前进道路上的赘瘤，不认真指导，随青年们去摸索。甚至把知识据为己有，把资料藏起来，把理论书籍霸占着，却指挥青年人为他的个人研究去找材料，搞数据。
    知识分子的资产阶级个人主义的表现是形形色色的，但是万变不离其宗，根本问题是从个人名利出发，而不顾国家和集体的利益。在这种思想支配下，他们只想以最少的劳动，取得最大的个人利益。这种思想发展到严重的时候，投机取巧什么都干得出来。
    资产阶级个人主义思想，正严重地障碍着我国科学技术文化教育事业的前进。对这些人，正确的学术思想是谈不进去的。你说联系实际，他却认为解决一个实际问题比他那种所谓论文要费劲得多，他当然不干。你说培养青年，他却觉得“后生可畏”，不把真本事教给青年。你说厚今薄古，他却为了谈古显得自己渊博，还可以东抄西凑，谈今却要有真本事，还容易碰钉子，他根本不敢干。你说集体协作，他却想独占名利，对这种要求他当然接受不了。你说服从国家需要，他心目中只有个人的小名小利，没有国家的大名大利，他怎么会服从国家的需要呢？
    在资产阶级个人主义的思想支配下，学术研究是按照个人的小打算零敲碎打，无计划无重点的。它好像一个没有脊椎骨的人，也许有一个手指头生得还很好，但就整个的人来说是站不起来的。社会主义社会不能依靠这样的人来发展经济和文化事业。
    问题很清楚，是资产阶级个人主义的严重的丑恶的思想在妨碍着许多知识分子的进步。它妨碍着学术的发展，它妨碍着国家建设的前进。要彻底地把资产阶级个人主义的丑恶面貌揭露出来，要把形形色色的资产阶级个人主义的表现完完全全地揭开，把它彻底搞臭，彻底烧透。必须把资产阶级个人主义的又脏又臭的本质摆到光天化日之下，让这种浓烈的臭气使任何人都掩鼻而去，这样才会使那些受资产阶级个人主义思想麻醉的人们清醒过来。
    在这一场双反的烈火中，我们要树起思想领域的红旗。我们的科学家，人人要讲真心话，不管是正确的或者不正确的，不管是不满或者牢骚，有什么说什么。只有当大家都敢于把什么思想都挖出来的时候，人们互相之间才可能有比较深刻的了解，才能进行比较深刻的批评和自我批评，从而把资产阶级个人主义思想烧透，把人们的思想问题解决，使大家轻松愉快地过社会主义这一关。这样做的目的是要把资产阶级个人主义思想彻底搞臭，并不是把所有有这种思想的人搞臭或者一棍子打死，而是以治病救人的态度使他们清醒过来。这样做不是乱戴一些帽子，而是要细致地摆事实，讲道理，开展严肃的批评和自我批评，使人们认识到资产阶级个人主义的思想对祖国建设事业的危害性，从而使更多的人们受到真正有益的教育。
