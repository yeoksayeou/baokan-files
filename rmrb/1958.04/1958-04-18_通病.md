    Notes

    Former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson recently launched a rather fierce attack on the Eisenhower administration's foreign policy. He said that because "they (referring to Eisenhower and Dulles) pursued a policy that was a hodgepodge of thrift, bellicosity, moralizing, and rudeness," European countries believed that "the United States has been dangerously suffering from schizophrenia in recent years." Acheson specifically listed symptoms such as: losing contact with the surrounding environment, decreased interest, foolish actions, bizarre behavior, sometimes catatonia, sometimes excitement, and impulsive and unpredictable actions. Judging from the series of actions taken by the United States in recent years, clinging to the Cold War policy and being afraid to sit down and negotiate with the Soviet Union, the former Secretary of State's accusations are partially justified.
    If that's the case, this former Secretary of State should advocate for a swift summit meeting, right? But things are not that way; instead, he believes that the U.S. president should not do the "silly thing" of attending a summit meeting.
    Obviously, Acheson and his successor Dulles are birds of a feather, which shows that the "schizophrenia" of fearing peace has become a common ailment of American politicians.

    通病
    前美国国务卿艾奇逊最近对艾森豪威尔政府的外交政策进行了颇为猛烈的攻击。他说，由于“他们（指艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯）通过一种由节约、好战、道学和无礼所杂凑起来的政策”，使欧洲各国认为“美国在最近几年中危险地患着精神分裂症”。艾奇逊还特别列举出这样一些症状：和周围的环境失去接触、兴趣减少、行动愚蠢、举止乖张、有时木僵、有时兴奋、行动冲动而不可测。从近年来，美国死抱住冷战政策不放，害怕同苏联坐下来进行协商的一系列做法看来，这位前国务卿的指责是有部分道理的。
    既然如此，这位前国务卿该主张迅速举行最高级会议了吧。但是事情竟又不是那样，他反而认为美国总统不应当去干参加最高级会议的“傻事”。
    显然，艾奇逊和他的继任者杜勒斯是一路货色，这说明害怕和平的“精神分裂症”已成为美国政客们的通病了。
