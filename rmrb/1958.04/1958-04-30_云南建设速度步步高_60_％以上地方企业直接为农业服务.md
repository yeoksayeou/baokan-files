Yunnan's Construction Speed Steadily Increases
Over 60% of Local Enterprises Directly Serve Agriculture

(Our newspaper's Kunming dispatch, April 29th) In Yunnan Province, over the past three months, 2,068 newly built small and medium-sized factories and mines have been completed. Most of the province's hundred-plus counties now possess more than ten small-scale factories and mines in areas such as electricity, iron smelting, agricultural machinery, and agricultural product processing. Not long ago, the border regions of the Kawa, Jingpo, and Lisu ethnic groups, which mainly used bamboo and wooden farm tools and practiced "slash-and-burn" agriculture, as well as the high-altitude mountainous areas where the Miao, Yao, Yi, Naxi, and other ethnic groups were scattered, also ended their ethnic groups' history of having no industry in just over three months, and built a number of small industrial and mining enterprises. The province's first steel plant built by a prefecture, the Yuxi Steel Plant, will be put into production on May 1st. Among the more than 2,000 newly built factories and mines, those directly serving agriculture, such as agricultural implements, agricultural product processing, and fertilizers, account for more than 60%. At the same time, Yunnan Province has also made full use of its advantageous conditions of particularly rich mineral and plant resources to establish many non-ferrous metal, coal, man-made fiber, and man-made petroleum factories and mines that are both urgently needed by the country and can quickly accumulate construction funds. At present, most counties in the province have their own coal mines, about half of the counties have non-ferrous metals or other mines, and about forty counties have begun to build man-made petroleum plants. Coupled with the original batch of enterprises, now, the chemical fertilizers, small smelting equipment, double-wheeled double-shared plows, oil presses, sugar presses, etc., needed by many prefectures and counties can be gradually turned into self-sufficiency; hundreds of newly built phosphate fertilizer plants and fertilizer plants are currently producing large amounts of fertilizer every day to support spring plowing production.

Because the masses were boldly mobilized, and the policy of self-reliance and diligence in running enterprises was adhered to, local industrial construction has formed a situation of steadily increasing and the speed of monthly linear increase. In February, an average of seven new factories and mines were put into production every day in the province; in March, it increased to an average of twenty-seven per day; in the first twenty days of April, about 1,020 new factories and mines were put into production in the province, averaging fifty-four per day.

    云南建设速度步步高
    60％以上地方企业直接为农业服务
    本报昆明29日电　云南省三个多月来，新建成的中小型厂矿已达二千零六十八个，全省一百多个县已大部分拥有电力、炼铁、农械和农产品加工等十个以上的小型厂矿。不久前还是以竹木农具为主、盛行“刀耕火种”制的边疆佧佤、景颇和傈僳族地区，内地苗、瑶、彝、纳西等民族散居的高寒山区，也在短短的三个多月之内结束了本民族没有工业的历史，建起了一批小型工矿企业。全省第一个由专区建设的炼钢厂——玉溪钢厂，将在五一节投入生产。在新建的二千多个新建厂矿中，农具、农产品加工和肥料等直接为农业服务的厂矿就占60％以上。同时，云南省又充分利用了矿产和植物资源特别丰富的有利条件，建立了不少既为国家迫切需要、又能迅速积累建设资金的有色金属、煤、人造纤维、人造石油等厂矿。目前，全省大部分县已有了自己的煤矿，半数左右的县有了有色金属或其他矿场，并有约四十个县开始动手建立人造石油厂。加上原有的一批企业，现在，许多专、县需要的化肥、小型冶炼设备、双轮双铧犁、榨油、榨糖机等，已可逐步转入自给自足；数百个新建的磷肥厂、化肥厂目前每天都出产大量肥料支援春耕生产。
    由于放手发动了群众，以及坚持自力更生、勤俭办企业的方针，地方工业建设就形成了步步登高，速度月月直线上升的局面。2月份全省平均每天有七个新厂矿投入生产；3月份就增加到每天平均二十七个；4月份的头二十天，全省又有约一千零二十个新厂矿投入生产，平均每天达到了五十四个。（张廷干）
