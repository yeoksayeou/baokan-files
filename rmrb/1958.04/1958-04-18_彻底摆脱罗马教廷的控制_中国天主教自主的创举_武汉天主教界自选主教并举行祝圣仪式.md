Completely Break Away from the Control of the Vatican
A Pioneering Undertaking of China's Independent Catholic Church
Wuhan Catholic Community Independently Elects Bishops and Holds Ordination Ceremony

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan – The Catholic community in Wuhan held a grand ceremony today, where Bishop Li Daonan "ordained" Dong Guangqing and Yuan Wenhua, the newly elected legitimate bishops of the Hankou Archdiocese and the Wuchang Diocese (a ceremony where a bishop with divine authority confers divine authority upon newly elected bishops). This righteous action paves the way for the thorough implementation of independence and self-governance in the Chinese Catholic Church.

Today, the Catholic Church on Shanghai Road in Hankou was decorated with lanterns and colorful decorations, and thousands of Catholic clergy and believers attended the ceremony. Bishop Li Daonan placed the Gospel on the shoulders of the new bishops, placed his hands on their heads, and also presented the "scepter" and "ring" to Dong Guangqing and Yuan Wenhua according to the ritual. From this point on, the two new bishops possessed full authority to manage the churches in their respective dioceses.

Bishop Wang Xueming of the Inner Mongolia Archdiocese, Bishop Li Boyu of the Zhouzhi Diocese in Shaanxi, Bishop Yi Xuanhua of the Xiangyang Diocese in Hubei, and Apostolic Administrator Chen Guangzu of the Suixian Diocese in Hubei served as "co-consecrators" (assisting in the ordination) for the two new bishops. Catholic clergy from twenty-one provinces and cities across the country also participated in the ceremony. Party and government officials from Wuhan and representatives from all walks of life also attended the ceremony.

Based on the principles of safeguarding national independence and dignity and implementing independence and self-governance in running the church, the two dioceses of Hankou and Wuchang respectively elected Dong Guangqing and Yuan Wenhua as bishops of the Hankou Archdiocese and the Wuchang Diocese on March 18th and 19th, and had telegraphed the election results to the Vatican. However, the Vatican adopted an attitude hostile to the Chinese people, and twice sent telegrams in late March unreasonably denying the election of the two new bishops, and threatened to excommunicate Bishops Li Daonan, Dong Guangqing, and Yuan Wenhua if the "ordination" ceremony was held, in an attempt to undermine this righteous action of the Catholic Church here. Patriotic Catholics in Wuhan were extremely indignant at the Vatican's unreasonable interference and shameless threats. They held a rally on April 9th to protest against this action by the Vatican. The rally also passed a protest letter to the Vatican, declaring that all orders and prohibitions issued by the Vatican that required Chinese Catholics to betray the interests of the motherland and the church would be considered invalid, and Chinese patriotic Catholics would never accept them. It was also declared that the “ordination” ceremony would be held on April 13th.

Since Catholicism was introduced to China more than 300 years ago, the Chinese Catholic Church has been controlled by the reactionary Vatican. The selection of church personnel has been recognized or designated by the Vatican, and the "ordination" ceremony for granting authority has been completely controlled by the Vatican. This "self-election and self-ordination" activity of the Catholic community in Wuhan is a major measure for the Chinese Catholic Church to completely break away from the control of the Vatican and implement independence and self-governance in running the church.

### 彻底摆脱罗马教廷的控制  中国天主教自主的创举  武汉天主教界自选主教并举行祝圣仪式

    彻底摆脱罗马教廷的控制
    中国天主教自主的创举
    武汉天主教界自选主教并举行祝圣仪式
    新华社武汉电　武汉市天主教界今天举行盛大典礼，由李道南主教给汉口总主教区、武昌教区两位新选合法主教董光清、袁文华“祝圣”（由有神权的主教授予新选主教以神权的仪式）。这一正义举动，为中国天主教彻底贯彻独立自主自办教会开创了道路。
    今天，汉口上海路天主堂里张灯结彩，上千的天主教神职人员和天主教徒参加了这个典礼。李道南主教把福音书放在新主教的肩上，双手按在新主教的头上，还按照仪式把“权杖”、“权戒”授给了董光清、袁文华。至此，两位新主教就有了管理两个教区教会的全部权力。
    内蒙古总主教区主教王学明、陕西盩厔教区主教李伯渔、湖北襄阳教区主教易宣化、湖北随县教区宗座总理陈光祖等四人给两位新主教作“赞礼”（陪同祝圣）。来自全国二十一个省、市的天主教神职人员也参加了这个典礼。武汉市党政负责人和各界代表也出席观礼。
    汉口、武昌两个教区根据维护祖国独立尊严、实行独立自主自办教会的原则，在3月18、19两日分别选出董光清、袁文华为汉口总主教区和武昌教区的主教，并且曾把选举情况电告罗马教廷。但是罗马教廷竟采取了与中国人民为敌的态度，3月下旬曾两次来电无理否认两位新主教的当选，并且威胁说如果举行“祝圣”仪式，就要开除李道南、董光清、袁文华三位主教的会籍，企图以此来破坏此间天主教的这一正义行动。武汉爱国天主教徒对罗马教廷的无理干涉和无耻威胁极为愤慨，他们在4月9日曾举行大会抗议罗马教廷的这一行动，大会还通过了致罗马教廷的抗议书，声明将在4月13日举行“祝圣”仪式，并且宣布说，罗马教廷发出的要中国教徒背叛祖国和教会利益的一切命令、禁令，都将被视为无效的，中国的爱国教徒永远也不会接受。
    自天主教传到中国三百多年来，中国天主教一直为反动的罗马教廷所控制，天主教会的人选都由罗马教廷认可或指定，授予权力的“祝圣”仪式也完全被罗马教廷所把持。这次武汉天主教界的“自选自圣”（自己选举、自己祝圣）活动是中国天主教彻底摆脱罗马教廷的控制、贯彻独立自主自办教会的一个重大措施。
