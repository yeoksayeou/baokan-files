In front of an ordinary tailor's table, I witnessed an unprecedented miracle: the owner of this table could cut a Zhongshan suit with four pockets from just over thirteen feet of cloth, saving more than two feet of cloth compared to the past.

I wonder if you've ever encountered such an embarrassing situation when dealing with tailors: you bring cloth, they measure it, look at you, and say "not enough," immediately turning you away. I've encountered this. Therefore, sometimes when I buy cloth, I'd rather buy more to avoid extra trips.

However, today after the tailor measured my cloth, he tore off a piece in front of me: "Here, please take this back, you won't need this much cloth!"

"Are you mistaken?" I asked.

The tailor grinned widely, repeatedly saying, "No mistake, rest assured." It turns out they recently learned a new type of cutting method that can fully utilize the material. "Haven't you seen our performance in the past few days? Many people came to watch."

"I..." I was truly ignorant.

"Look, isn't that person cutting over there? You can go take a look."

So, in front of an ordinary tailor's table, I witnessed the aforementioned unprecedented miracle.

An Old Woman and a Small Box

Not long ago, a wooden box was nailed to the door frame of my house, resembling a milk box in appearance, with a lock on it. But instead of milk bottles, it held a small notebook for buying coal.

It was installed by the nearby coal store for us. With it, we don't have to go to the store or make phone calls to buy coal; we just fill in the required quantity and type in the notebook, put it in the box, and they'll deliver it the next day.

We all cherish this box. Because it doesn't just relate to the lives of one or two households, it warms the hearts of dozens of households in this area.

We cherish this box as if it were our own property, cleaning it especially thoroughly every time we do a major cleaning. Old Woman Wang from the same courtyard sometimes even wipes it carefully with a cloth.

This morning, a strong wind was blowing outside, and our walnut tree was rustling, with broken branches and rotten leaves scattered all over the ground. I hunched my shoulders and went to work, and almost tripped when I opened the door.

An old woman was unexpectedly standing in front of our door.

"You?"

She was Grandma Feng from across the street, an old woman in her sixties.

"I'm here to check on the little box," she replied, seeming very casual.

She wasn't just "checking." She was holding an axe and some nails in her hand. A little girl was standing next to her, holding a small stool.

"The wind is too strong, I came to add some nails," Grandma Feng said, pointing to the little box. "They're making things convenient for us, we can't just watch it get blown away." Then, she was about to shakily step onto the small stool.

I immediately took the axe. But before I could pick up the nails, someone else snatched them away: "You go to work, I'll do it!"

Old Woman Wang didn't know when she had arrived, and she jumped onto the stool and started hammering nails: "The coal store is leaping forward for us, we must proactively help the coal store."

Now, our little box has nails added all around it. Now, no matter what kind of strong wind blows, that little box won't budge at all.

    做衣服时的奇遇（外一章）
    韦石
    在一个普通的裁缝师傅使用的枱子跟前，我看见一种前所未有的奇迹：这个枱子的主人能把十三尺多布给你裁一套带有四个兜兜的中山装，比过去节省两尺多布。
    不知道你以前跟裁缝师傅打交道时，是否碰到过这样的尴尬局面：你带了布去，他给你一量，望望你，“不够”，一下子把你挡回去。我碰到过这种事。因此，有时候我买布，宁肯多买些，省得再跑路。
    可是，今天裁缝师傅量完我的布以后，当面给我撕下一块来：“这个，请您带回去，您用不了这么多布！”
    “你弄错了吧？”我问。
    裁缝师傅咧开大嘴，一个劲儿地笑：“没错，您放心。”原来他们新近学会了一种最新式的裁剪法，能把原料充分地用上。“你没看到过我们在前几天的表演？来看的人可多了。”
    “我……”我可真是孤陋寡闻。
    “你看，那边不还正在剪？你可以去看看。”
    于是，我在一个普通的裁缝师傅使用的枱子跟前，看见了一种前所未有的上边说过的那种奇迹。
    老太太和一个小匣子
    不久以前，我家的大门门框上钉了个木头匣子，外状跟奶箱相似，上边也有一把锁。但它里边不放奶瓶，放的是买煤的小本子。
    它是附近的煤店给我们钉上的。有了它，买煤时不必跑路，也无需拨电话，只要把需要的数量和品种，填在本本上，放到匣子里，人家第二天就给你送来。
    我们都爱护这个匣子。因为它不只是关系到一两户人家的生活，它温暖了这一带几十户人家的每颗心。
    我们爱护这个匣子有如自己的财物，每一次进行大扫除时，都把它扫得特别干净。同院的王大妈有时候还用抹布来仔细揩拭。
    这天早晨，外边刮大风，我们的那棵核桃树呼呼地响，碎枝子烂叶子落了一地。我缩着脖子去上班，一开大门，我差一点绊倒。
    有个老太太，意外地站在我们大门前。
    “您？”
    她是对门的冯奶奶，一个六十多岁的老太太。
    “我来看看小匣子，”她显得非常随便的样子，回答我。
    她可不完全是“看看”。她手里拿着把斧子，还有几根铁钉。她旁边还站着个小闺女，小闺女抱着个矮凳。
    “风太大，我看得再钉钉。”冯奶奶说，还指着那个小匣子，“人家为咱方便，咱不能眼看它刮坏。”接着，她颤巍巍地就要上矮凳。
    我一手接过来斧子。可我还没拿起铁钉，又被另一个人抢过去：“你上班去，我来！”
    王大妈不知啥时候也赶了来，她一下子跳到凳子上就敲起铁钉：“煤店为咱们跃进，咱们得主动地帮助煤店。”
    现在，我们的那个小匣子四周都加上了铁钉。现在，不管刮什么样的大风，那个小匣子丝毫也不会动。
