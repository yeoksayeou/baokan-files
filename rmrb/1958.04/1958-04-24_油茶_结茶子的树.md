Small Information

    Oil tea is a tree whose seeds are tea seeds (茶子). Tea seeds can be pressed for oil, called tea oil, which can be eaten and also used to make soap, lubricating oil, etc. It is a non-drying oil.

    China's tea seed producing areas are mainly distributed in: Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hubei, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, among which Hunan has the largest output.

    Oil tea is an evergreen tree belonging to the Camellia family. Although it grows slowly, it has a long lifespan. Well-cultivated trees can live for more than a hundred years. In order to keep it blooming and bearing fruit, it must be regularly nurtured and managed. China's tea seed varieties are mainly divided into small-grained seeds (i.e., Hanlu species) and large-grained seeds (i.e., Shuangjiang species). The small-grained seeds have a low yield but a high oil content, with 100 jin of tea seeds yielding 30 jin of oil. The large-grained seeds have a higher yield, and the oil content is slightly lower than that of the small-grained seeds, with an oil yield of about 25%.

    油茶—结茶子的树
    油茶的种子是茶子。茶子可以榨油，油叫茶油，可以食用，也可以制肥皂、润滑油等，属不干性油。
    我国茶子产区主要分布在：湖南、广西、江西、浙江、福建、广东、四川、贵州、云南、湖北、安徽和江苏等省，其中以湖南产量最大。
    油茶是常绿乔木，属山茶科，生长虽慢但寿命很长，培育好的能活一百年以上。为了使它不断开花结实，必须定期加强抚育管理。我国茶子品种主要分小粒种（即寒露种）、大粒种（即霜降种）。小粒种产量低但含油量高，一百斤茶子可出油三十斤。大粒种产量高，含油量略低于小粒种，出油率在25％左右。
