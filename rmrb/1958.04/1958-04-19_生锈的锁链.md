    Rusty Chains
    Britain's main crisis is production stagnation. Britain is becoming a "second-rate industrial power." This is the view of Wilson, the chief spokesman on economic issues for the British Labour Party, on Britain's current economic situation. His countermeasure is to demand that the Conservative government "get rid of" the "rusty chains" that bind East-West trade.
    This "chain"—the so-called "embargo"—manufactured single-handedly by the United States has not caused any harm to socialist countries. On the contrary, some Western countries tied to it have suffered a lot. Because selling goods to the United States requires encountering very high tariff barriers, and doing business with socialist countries is also greatly restricted by the United States. At a time when the US economic crisis is sinking deeper and deeper, it is necessary to guard against the US attempt to tighten the "chains" and pass on the disaster. Wilson not only revealed the misery of being "bound," but also revealed the courage to break through this "chain," because it is already "rusty."

    生锈的锁链
    英国面临的主要危机是生产停滞。英国正在变成“二流工业国”。这是英国工党经济问题首席发言人威尔逊对英国当前经济情况的看法。他的对策是要求保守党政府“摆脱”束缚东西方贸易的“生锈的锁链”。
    美国一手制造的这条“锁链”——所谓“禁运”，并没有使社会主义国家受到什么损害，倒是被系在上面的一些西方国家为此吃了不少苦头。因为它们向美国卖货要碰关税很高的壁，同社会主义国家做生意又受到美国很大限制。值此美国经济危机越陷越深之际，不能不提防美国拉紧“锁链”转嫁灾祸的企图。威尔逊不仅道出了遭受“束缚”的惨状，也道出了冲破这条“锁链”的勇气，因为它已是“生锈的”了。
