Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Premier Zhou Enlai stated tonight at a banquet held for the heads of diplomatic missions and economic delegations of various countries in China: The Soviet government, based on the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, has decided to unilaterally cease testing of any type of atomic and hydrogen weapons from March 31, 1958. This great peaceful initiative benefiting mankind deserves our welcome and support. The Soviet initiative was first supported by Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, and the chief ambassador at today's banquet happens to be the representative of this peace-loving nation, which is worthy of our congratulations. The Chinese government has also received a notification from the Soviet government regarding this decision. I take this opportunity to ask the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to convey to the Soviet government that the Chinese government and the Chinese people warmly support this significant initiative of the Soviet government. I also ask the envoys of other countries present here to convey to their governments that the Chinese government hopes that their governments, especially the governments of countries possessing nuclear weapons, will also actively support and respond to this decision of the Soviet government.
    Tonight’s banquet was held by the heads of diplomatic missions and economic delegations of various countries in China for Premier of the State Council, former Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, and Vice Premier of the State Council and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and his wife.
    Also attending the banquet were Vice Premiers of the State Council Peng Dehuai, He Long, Li Fuchun, Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Burhan, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Luo Guibo, Ji Pengfei, and heads of various government departments.
    Burmese Ambassador U Hla Maung, in his capacity as head of the mission, delivered a speech on behalf of all the heads of diplomatic missions and economic delegations stationed in Beijing. He said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Zhou Enlai has served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and during this period, we have had the opportunity to have close contact with Mr. Zhou Enlai. He has made time to meet with us frequently, pleasantly, and informally, which has provided the greatest possible assistance in promoting friendly relations between our countries. He expressed his gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of all the heads of delegations. U Hla Maung also said that since Mr. Chen Yi is also our old friend, we believe that this close relationship will continue after he takes office.
    Ambassador U Hla Maung also presented a silver shield to Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of the heads of diplomatic missions and economic delegations stationed in Beijing. The silver shield is engraved with a model of the earth and a dove symbolizing peace and friendship. The silver shield, signed by the envoys and heads of economic delegations of various countries in China, is also engraved with the words "In Commemoration of the Friendly Cooperation During the Tenure of Mr. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China."
    Premier Zhou spoke amidst warm applause. He thanked Ambassador U Hla Maung for his speech and especially thanked the hosts for the gift, considering it a manifestation of goodwill towards the Chinese people from friends of countries that have established diplomatic and economic and trade relations with our country.
    Premier Zhou especially mentioned the words "friendly cooperation" on the gift and particularly thanked the envoys and heads of economic delegations of various countries for their friendly cooperation with China. He said that the Chinese government has consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace and friendship, which has received the cooperation and support of the envoys and heads of economic delegations of various countries. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China, India, and Burma have been approved and supported by an increasing number of countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe. This is something particularly gratifying as we gather together today.
    When discussing the issue of peaceful coexistence, Premier Zhou especially pointed out the great significance of the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapon testing on March 31, 1958, a peaceful initiative.
    Premier Zhou concluded by saying: "We believe that the world situation is definitely trending towards easing, and the cause of world peace will surely triumph over everything." He proposed a toast to world peace and the friendly cooperation of the people of all countries.
    All the Chinese and foreign attendees attentively listened to Premier Zhou Enlai's speech and welcomed it with wave after wave of applause.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi was unable to attend the banquet today due to illness. His wife, Zhang Qian, delivered a speech on his behalf. Zhang Qian conveyed Vice Premier Chen Yi's thanks to the hosts. She used the host's wine to thank the host's hospitality and suggested a toast to enhancing the cooperation of the people of all countries and to the desire of the people of all countries to safeguard world peace.
    The grand banquet held in the Peace Hotel was truly filled with an atmosphere of peace and cooperation. During the banquet, artists from the capital also performed many wonderful programs.
