    Maoming Petrochemical City: Construction Preparations in Full Swing
    Guangdong Establishes Maoming Industrial Zone Construction Committee

    The preparatory work before the full-scale construction of the Guangdong Maoming Oil Shale Joint Enterprise has begun. The oil shale mine, which has been dormant for thousands of years, has been awakened by the sounds of the first batch of construction workers, and the construction site is a hive of activity.
    The construction base of this joint enterprise, the building materials enterprises, and fourteen large-scale temporary projects such as construction water and electricity supply, as well as off-site projects such as the Lianjiang-Maoming railway, industrial avenue, ring mountain road, flood control, and telecommunications equipment, have all commenced.
    Guangdong Province has established the Maoming Industrial Zone Construction Committee, which will vigorously support the construction of the oil shale joint enterprise in all aspects. (Xinhua News Agency)
