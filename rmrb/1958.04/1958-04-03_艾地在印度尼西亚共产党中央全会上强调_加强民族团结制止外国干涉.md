Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 1st – The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party opened in Jakarta on March 31st. The party's General Secretary, Aidit, delivered a 50-page report at the meeting, entitled: "The New Stage and Adapting the Organization to the Situation."

In his report, Aidit, on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Party, reported to the Central Committee on the work of the past six months and proposed new goals for future work.

In the section on the international political situation, Aidit especially focused on analyzing the recent economic recession in the United States.

Aidit pointed out that Indonesia is bound to be affected by this US economic recession. This is because Indonesia's economy is extremely dependent on foreign countries, first and foremost on exports, especially due to the fact that, according to Foreign Minister Subandrio, 40% of Indonesia's exports are shipped to the United States, which is experiencing an economic recession, and another 40% are shipped to Western Europe, which is affected by the US economic recession.

Aidit said that, under these circumstances, if the Indonesian government wants to contribute to the people, it must take firm and active steps to protect Indonesia from the dangers of this economic recession.

Regarding foreign investment, Aidit pointed out that the recent US arms assistance to rebel groups and the preparation to occupy a part of Sumatra under the pretext of protecting its capital and expatriates must be remembered. Aidit said that these are the results of American investment in Indonesia. He said that, on the one hand, rejecting Dutch capital, and on the other hand, absorbing capital from the United States, West Germany, and Japan, is tantamount to "driving the tiger out the front door and letting the lion in the back door."

Regarding the domestic political situation in Indonesia, after describing the major events of the past six months, Aidit said that the firm attitude taken by the Juanda government towards the rebel groups, and supported by President Sukarno, has received widespread support from the masses. No other cabinet since Indonesia's independence has ever received such support.

Aidit continued that when the government adopts a realistic and active attitude, it can control the situation and prevent the disintegration of the Republic, and this is the primary condition for preventing foreign interference.

In discussing the National Front issue, Aidit said that broad political freedom is very important for developing progressive forces and establishing an extremely broad National Front. Therefore, the general task of the Communists is to safeguard, strengthen, and promote political freedom or political democracy.

He pointed out that the anti-communist policy is not only entirely an imperialist policy, but also an anti-national and anti-democratic policy.

Aidit's report has been submitted to the plenary session for discussion.

    艾地在印度尼西亚共产党中央全会上强调
    加强民族团结制止外国干涉
    据新华社雅加达1日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第六次全体会议3月31日在雅加达开幕。党的总书记艾地在会议上作了长五十页的报告，题目是：“新阶段以及使组织适应形势”。
    艾地在他的报告里代表党的政治局向中央委员会报告了半年来的工作并且提出今后工作的新目标。
    艾地在关于国际政治局势这一部分中特别着重分析了美国最近半年来的经济衰退。
    艾地指出，印度尼西亚必然要受到美国的这种经济衰退的影响。这是因为印度尼西亚的经济极其依赖外国，首先是依赖出口，特别是由于这个事实：据外交部长苏班德里约说，印度尼西亚的出口货有40％是输往正在发生经济衰退的美国的，另外40％是输往受到美国经济衰退影响的西欧的。
    艾地说，在这种情况下，如果印度尼西亚政府要对人民作出贡献，它就必须采取坚定而积极的步骤使印度尼西亚免遭这种经济衰退的危险。
    关于外国投资，艾地指出，最近美国曾以武器援助叛乱集团，并且准备以保护它的资本和侨民为借口占领苏门答腊的一部分领土，这个教训必须记住。艾地说，这些就是美国在印度尼西亚投资的结果。他说，一方面拒绝荷兰资本，另一方面却吸收美国、西德和日本的资本，这种作法就等于是“从前门把老虎赶走，从后门把狮子引进来”。
    关于印度尼西亚国内政治局势，艾地在叙述了最近六个月的重大事件以后说，朱安达政府对叛乱集团采取的、并且得到苏加诺总统支持的坚定态度得到群众的广泛支持，自从印度尼西亚独立以来，其他任何一届内阁都未曾得到这样的支持。
    艾地继续说，当政府采取现实的和积极的态度时，它就能控制局势并防止共和国瓦解，而这是制止外国干涉的首要条件。
    在谈到民族阵线问题时，艾地说，广泛的政治自由对于发展进步力量和建立极其广泛的民族阵线是非常重要的。因此，共产党人的总任务是保障、加强和发扬政治自由或政治民主。
    他指出，反共政策不仅完全是帝国主义的政策，而且也是反民族和反民主的政策。
    艾地的报告已经提交全体会议讨论。
