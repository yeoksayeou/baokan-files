Three Post-War American Economic Recessions

The United States has experienced three economic recessions since the war.

The First Recession Was Saved by the Korean War

The first recession began in October 1948 and reached its lowest point in July 1949. During this period, the industrial production index fell from 105 (1947-1949 = 100, the same below) to 94, a drop of 10.5%. The main reason for this economic decline was the rapid rise in prices after the war (consumer prices rose by 33% from 1945 to 1949), which greatly weakened consumers' purchasing power, leading to market contraction. As a result, large enterprises had to temporarily reduce investment. However, because the renewal of fixed capital in the United States after the war was far from complete at that time, and consumers' postponed demand during the war had not been met, the growth of private consumption and business investment again promoted the rapid recovery of industry after more than a year. The outbreak of the Korean War accelerated this process.

The Second Recession Was Eased by Stepped-Up Military Expansion

The second economic recession began in July 1953 and fell to its lowest point in March 1954. During this period, the industrial production index fell from 137 to 123, a drop of 10.2%. This decline was caused by the end of the Korean War, the disappearance of wartime prosperity, and the reduction of private consumption and business investment. Before this recession occurred, the U.S. government had implemented tax cuts and later relaxed credit, using various methods to stimulate business investment in order to restore the economy. But more importantly, the large U.S. corporations' post-war plans to expand factory facilities were still underway, and consumer demand for housing and automobiles had not yet been met. Therefore, by 1954, under the influence of these factors, coupled with the U.S. government maintaining military spending far exceeding pre-war levels, industrial production quickly recovered.

This Time the Amplitude Exceeds the Previous Two

The current decline in U.S. industrial production, in the short term, started in August of last year. In six months, the industrial production index fell from 145 in August of last year to 130 in February, a decrease of 9.7%. In the long term, it started in December of the year before last. The industrial production index fell from 147 to 130 in one year and two months, a drop of more than 11%. This exceeds the magnitude of the previous two recessions.

At the eve of the previous two economic recessions, the operating rate of U.S. industry was close to 100%. When industrial production fell to its lowest point, it still remained between 80% and 82%. Therefore, the problem of excess productivity was not serious. However, in August of last year, when this economic recession broke out, the operating rate of U.S. industry as a whole was only 82%, and in January it fell to 73%. It is now estimated to have fallen below 70%. Due to this serious excess of productivity, even many bourgeois economists in the United States believe that this economic recession will not recover quickly. (Ya) (Attached picture)

### 战后美国三次经济衰退

    战后美国三次经济衰退
    战后美国发生过三次经济衰退。
    第一次衰退靠侵朝战争救了命
    第一次衰退是从1948年10月开始，到1949年7月达到最低点。在这段时期，工业生产指数从一百零五（1947—1949年为100，下同）下降到九十四，共下跌了10.5％。这次经济下降的主要原因，是战后物价上涨过快（消费品价格从1945—1949年上涨了33％），消费者的购买力受到很大削弱，引起市场萎缩，因而大企业也不得不暂时缩减投资。但是，由于战后美国固定资本的更新在当时还远没有完成，消费者战时推迟的需求也没有满足，所以经过一年多的时间，美国私人消费和企业投资的增长又促进了工业的很快恢复，朝鲜战争的爆发更加快了这一过程。
    第二次衰退靠加紧扩军缓和下来
    第二次经济衰退是从1953年7月开始，到1954年3月下降到最低点。在这段时期，工业生产指数从一百三十七下降到一百二十三，计下跌了10.2％。这次下降是由于朝鲜战争结束，战时景气消失，私人消费和企业投资的缩减引起的。在这次衰退发生以前，美国政府曾实行减税，以后并放宽信贷，用各种方法刺激企业投资，以求恢复经济。但更重要的是当时美国大企业战后的扩充厂房设备计划还在进行，消费者对房屋和汽车的需求仍未满足。所以到1954年在这些因素的作用下，再加上美国政府保持远超过战前的军费，工业生产就又很快恢复。
    这一回超过前两次的幅度
    目前这次美国工业生产的下降，从近期来说，是从去年8月开始。在六个月中，工业生产指数从去年8月的一百四十五下降到2月的一百三十，计下降了9.7％，从远期说，则是从前年12月开始。工业生产指数在一年零两个月中由一百四十七下降到一百三十，下降在11％以上。已超过前两次衰退的幅度。
    在上两次经济衰退爆发前夕，美国工业开工率都接近100％。在工业生产下降到最低点时，仍保持在80％到82％之间。所以生产力过剩问题不算严重。但是在去年8月，这次经济衰退爆发时，美国整个工业的开工率只有82％，1月份下降到73％。现时估计应已降至70％以下。由于这种严重的生产力过剩，所以连美国许多资产阶级经济学者也认为这次经济衰退不会很快恢复。　（亚）（附图片）
