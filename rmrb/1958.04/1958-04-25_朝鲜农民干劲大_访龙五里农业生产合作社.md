Korean Farmers Have Great Enthusiasm
——Visiting the Ryongyo-ri Agricultural Production Cooperative
By Our Correspondent Wang Yuzhang

In the Early Spring Fields

Not long ago, I visited the countryside of Mundok County, north of Pyongyang.

Leaving Pyongyang by car, I saw azalea buds already swelling on the mountainside by the roadside, but the north wind blowing against my face was still piercingly cold. On the vast twelve or thirteen thousand *li* plain, there was not a trace of green. In northern Korea, the end of March has always been a "slack season" for spring. But this year, groups of Korean farmers in white clothes were busy everywhere on the hillsides and in the fields. In order to produce 650,000 tons more grain than the state plan this year, and to bring this year's grain output to 3,950,000 tons, that is, to overfulfill the 1961 grain output stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule, Korean farmers have already invested in intense labor.

The office of the Ryongyo-ri agricultural cooperative was deserted, and the cooperative cadres had all gone to the fields. The Labor Party village committee secretary, who arrived later, said that all the members of the village, except for women in childbirth, had been mobilized. The current shock work is, first of all, raising rice seedlings using the cold frame method. Around the Ryongyo-ri village, there is a large area of windbreak tents made of corn stalks, and inside the tents are cold frame nurseries. In the nursery of the Fourth Production Team, sixty-year-old cooperative member Zhu Nankui was carefully scattering rice seeds onto the fertilizer-laid seedbeds that were sunken into the ground. Afterwards, other cooperative members spread a layer of sand on top of the rice seeds, watered them, and then tightly covered the rows of seedbeds, each eight meters long and 1.2 meters wide, with glass windows or oiled paper windows, creating a simple greenhouse and raising seedlings one to two months earlier. Last year, 30% of the cooperative's paddy fields were planted with this "cold frame seedlings," resulting in a harvest of 6.2 tons per *chongbo* (equivalent to 15 Chinese *mu*), more than two tons more than the rice grown by the cooperative using water seedlings.

Zhu Nankui said that before liberation, the highest yield of rice here was no more than two tons, and no one believed in six tons. However, this year all their paddy fields will be planted with "cold frame seedlings," and they will all achieve a yield of six tons per *chongbo*. Farmers in northern Korea want to expand the area of "cold frame seedlings" from 10% of the paddy fields last year to more than 70%, and increase the rice yield from an average of 2.9 tons per *chongbo* last year to 3.7 tons. Korean farmers call this leap-forward technical reform a great revolution in rice production.

The village party committee secretary said that last year's bumper harvest further boosted the enthusiasm of the farmers. Last winter and this spring, the cooperative members rushed to make 30,000 wooden windows needed for cold frame nurseries for the cooperative's more than 500 *chongbo* of paddy fields. As soon as the ground began to thaw this spring, the cooperative members began to repair seedbeds and build windbreak tents day and night, and now 45% of the nurseries have been sown with rice seeds. The cooperative members proudly said that this year they will start transplanting rice seedlings on April 18 and complete it all by the end of May. In the past, the end of May was just the beginning of transplanting rice seedlings.

For this year's bumper harvest, the members of Ryongyo-ri have not been idle for a single day last winter and this spring. Even the sixty-year-old farmer Zhu Nankui has already worked eighty workdays this year. While making "cold frame seedlings," the cooperative members also accumulated a large amount of fertilizer. They braved snow and frost, dug river mud, cleaned ditches, and dug pigsties, and have now accumulated more than 7,000 tons of compost. From the end of January, when the earth was still covered with white snow, the cooperative's more than fifty ox carts began to transport fertilizer to the fields. The night before we arrived in Ryongyo-ri, members of the Democratic Youth League were still carrying fertilizer at night until twelve o'clock. Now, piles of black fertilizer, like chess pieces in a chessboard, are densely scattered in the fields around Ryongyo-ri. Farmers say that with the water from the South Pyongan Province irrigation project, cold frame seedlings and fertilizer, there is no problem in getting six tons of rice per *chongbo*.

The Changes in Ryongyo-ri

If you want to ask where the enthusiasm of the farmers in Ryongyo-ri comes from, you have to trace back to the past of Ryongyo-ri. Before liberation, 262 tenant farmers in Ryongyo-ri cultivated more than 400 *chongbo* of land belonging to nine landlords. Forty-eight-year-old tenant farmer Zhu Nanhao said that at that time, if they harvested twenty straw bags of rice, the landlord would take away thirteen bags. The tenant farmers grew rice, but had to sell it to exchange for cheap sorghum and barnyard millet to eat. After liberation, the tenant farmers were given land, and the Republic government built water conservancy projects here, and the lives of the farmers improved greatly. However, at that time, it was still individual production, and they were weak and lacked strength, and they did not fundamentally get rid of poverty.

In 1954, this *ri* was formed into an agricultural cooperative by 29 poor peasant households. In the first year, they increased the yield of rice per *chongbo* to three tons. As soon as the agricultural cooperative was established, it was like a magnet, attracting all 471 peasant households in the *ri* into the cooperative within three years. The agricultural cooperative's days are also getting better and better, and the rice yield has increased to an average of 4.7 tons per *chongbo* last year. Last year, each household in the cooperative received an average of 2.8 tons of rice. Ryongyo-ri, where more than half of the households used to be short of food, sold 686 tons of surplus grain last year.

When it comes to the benefits of agricultural cooperatives, people's words never end. Vice-chairman Jin In-guk said that in the past, Ryongyo-ri had fifty oxen, big and small, and the land was not finished plowing when it was time to transplant the rice seedlings, and the crops were always poorly planted. Now, 80% of the cooperative's land is cultivated by the tractor station, and the cooperative also has eighty-eight big yellow oxen, so whatever crops are planted can be done in time. Furthermore, everyone knows that "cold frame seedlings" can increase production, but in the past, individual farmers did not have the money to buy wood to make so many wooden windows, and did not have so much manpower to carefully take care of them, so they could not be promoted. In addition, the South Pyongan Province irrigation project has now been completed, bringing water from the Daedong River and the Chongchon River, so there is no need to worry about drought here anymore. Farmer Jin Zhonglie spoke even more directly. He said that the fields in Ryongyo-ri were bombed with 125 large bomb craters by American planes. Filling one crater required 200 cubic meters of soil and 200 man-days. An individual farmer would have to work for a year to fill one crater, so they would not be able to plant the land. However, the agricultural cooperative filled all these craters in one spring, without affecting production at all.

The power of the agricultural cooperative is obvious to all in Ryongyo-ri. Therefore, in January last year, even Han Shenghao, a middle peasant with the highest planting technology who had always been unconvinced by the agricultural cooperative, led his old yellow ox to join the cooperative.

During the war, the houses of more than 100 farmers in Ryongyo-ri were destroyed by American planes. After the establishment of the agricultural cooperative, a construction team was organized, and more than 80 houses were built for the farmers last year alone, and another 50 will be built this year. In addition, a red two-story building stands on the hillside at the head of the village. This is the cooperative's newly built middle school building, with twenty-four classrooms inside. It was jointly built by the Ryongyo-ri and Bopyeong-ri agricultural cooperatives, and the building will be completed this summer. Before liberation, there were more than 200 children out of school in Ryongyo-ri. But today, all the children are in school, and there are many middle school students in the village. When this new middle school is completed, there will be more middle school students in Ryongyo-ri.

The changes in Ryongyo-ri have made the farmers realize the power of the collective, especially realizing that the road pointed out by the Korean Workers' Party is the road for the farmers to move towards happiness. This is the reason why the enthusiasm of Korean farmers to increase production is getting greater and greater.

    朝鲜农民干劲大
    ——访龙五里农业生产合作社
    本报记者　王玉章
    在初春的田野上
    不久前，我访问了平壤以北文德郡的农村。
    车出平壤，就看见路旁山坡上的金达莱花已鼓起花苞，但迎面吹来的北风却还夹着刺骨的寒冷。坦荡的十二三千里平原上还没有一丝儿绿意。在朝鲜北部，3月底一向是“春闲”的季节。可是今年，山坡上、田野里到处是一群群穿白衣的朝鲜农民在忙碌着。朝鲜农民为了今年比国家计划多生产六十五万吨粮食，使今年的粮产量达到三百九十五万吨，即提前三年超额完成第一个五年计划规定的1961年粮产量，早已投入了紧张的劳动。
    龙五里农业社的办公室里冷清清的，社干部们都到地里去了。后来赶来的劳动党里党委员长说，全村除了产妇以外，所有的社员都出动了。当前的突击工作，首先是用冷床育苗法育稻秧。龙五里村庄的周围，有一大片用玉蜀黍秸扎成的防风帐，帐内就是冷床苗圃。在第四生产队的苗圃里，六十岁的老社员朱南奎正在把稻种细心地撒到凹入地下的铺好了肥料的苗床上去，随后其他社员们在稻种的上面铺上一层沙，浇上水，然后用一扇扇的玻璃窗或油纸窗把一条条的长八公尺、宽一点二公尺的苗床严密盖起，这就造成了简单的温室，提早一个月到两个月育秧。去年这个社的水田有30％种了这种“冷床苗”，结果每町步（合我国十五市亩）收获了六点二吨，比社里用水苗种的水稻多收二吨多。
    朱南奎说，解放以前，这里水稻的最高产量也不过二吨多，六吨简直没有人相信。可是，今年他们的全部水田都要种“冷床苗”，都要达到每町步六吨的产量。朝鲜北部的农民要把“冷床苗”的面积由去年的占水田的10％，扩大到70％以上，把水稻产量由去年的平均每町步二点九吨提高到三点七吨。朝鲜农民把这次跃进式的技术改革叫作水稻生产大革命。
    里党委员长说，去年的丰收更鼓起了农民的干劲，去冬今春，社员们为全社的五百多町步水田赶造了三万扇冷床苗圃需要的木窗。今春地刚开始解冻，社员们就不分日夜地开始修苗床，扎防风帐，到现在已有45％的苗圃播下了稻种。社员们骄傲地说，今年要在4月18日开始插秧，5月底全部完成。而在过去，5月底是刚刚开始插秧的时候。
    为了今年的丰收，龙五里的社员们去冬今春一天也没有闲。就连六十岁的朱南奎老农民今年已经作了八十个劳动日。社员们一边弄“冷床苗”，一边大量积肥，他们披雪踏霜，挖河泥，掏水沟，掘猪圈，到现在已积了七千多吨堆肥。从1月底，白雪还复盖着大地的时候，社里的五十多辆牛车就开始往田里送肥了。我们到龙五里的前一天夜里，民主青年同盟的盟员们夜里背肥料还干到十二点。现在，一堆堆黑色的肥料，像棋盘里的棋子，密层层地散布在龙五里周围的田地里。农民们说，有了平安南道灌溉工程的水，有了冷床苗和肥料，每町步六吨稻谷没有问题。
            龙五里的变迁
    如果要问龙五里农民们的干劲是从哪里来的，那就要追溯到龙五里的过去。解放前的龙五里，二百六十二户佃农种着九个地主的四百多町步土地。四十八岁的佃农朱南浩说，那时收二十草袋稻子地主就要拿去十三袋。佃农们种的是稻子，但却不得不变卖了去换廉价的高粱、稗子来吃。解放后，佃农们分到了土地，共和国政府在这里修了水利，农民们的生活有了很大的改善。但是，那时仍然是个体生产，人单力薄，没有根本摆脱贫困状态。
    1954年这个里由二十九户贫农组成了农业社，第一年就把每町步水稻的产量提高到三吨。农业社一成立，就像磁石一样，在三年的期间内，把全里的四百七十一户农民全部吸引到社里来了。农业社的日子也蒸蒸日上，水稻的产量到去年已提高到平均每町步四点七吨。去年全社每户平均分得了二点八吨稻谷，过去缺粮户占过半数的龙五里，去年卖了六百八十六吨余粮。
    谈起农业社的好处来，人们的话就没有个完。副社长金仁国说，过去龙五里七大八小有五十条牛，该插秧时还没有耕完地，庄稼老种不好。现在社里的土地80％归拖拉机站代耕，另外社里还有八十八条大黄牛，种什么庄稼都能赶到时候上。再说，“冷床苗”能增产谁也知道，但过去单干农户没有钱买木材作那么多木窗，没有那么多的人力去细致地侍弄，所以推广不起来。另外，现在建成了平安南道灌溉工程，把大同江和清川江的水引过来，这里再也不愁旱了。农民金钟烈讲的更直接。他说，龙五里的田里被美机炸了一百二十五个大炸弹坑，填平一个坑要二百立方土，要二百个人工，单干农民一个人要干一年，就不用种地了。可是，农业社一个春天就把这些弹坑都填平了，一点也没有影响生产。
    农业社的威力在龙五里是有目共睹的。所以，在去年1月，连种地技术最高、一直不服气农业社的中农韩圣镐，也牵着他的老黄牛前来入社了。
    战争时期，龙五里有一百多户农民的住宅被美机炸毁了。农业社成立后就组织了一个建设班，仅在去年就为农民盖了八十多幢住宅，今年还要盖五十幢。此外，村头山岗上矗立起一座红色的二层楼，这是社里新盖的中学校舍，里面有二十四个教室。这是龙五里和博飞里两个农业社合资兴建的，大楼将在今年夏天竣工。在解放以前，龙五里有二百多个失学的儿童。可是今天，儿童们全部上了学，村子里的中学生也不少。当这座新的中学建成以后，龙五里的中学生就会更多起来。
    龙五里的变迁使农民认识了集体的力量，特别是认识到朝鲜劳动党所指出的道路是农民们走向幸福的道路。这就是朝鲜农民增产的干劲越来越大的原因。
