    New Milestone
    By Chen Quanbi, Our Correspondent
    The first session of the Fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union formally closed on March 31st after a five-day session. This was a session of great leap forward. As "Izvestia" commented at the opening of the meeting, this is a new milestone in the entire course of historical development.
    At the closing meeting on the 31st, in addition to announcing the composition of the Soviet government and passing the law on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations based on Comrade Khrushchev's report, the Soviet Supreme Soviet also made a major event that shocked the world and inspired people, namely, the adoption of the resolution on the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear and hydrogen weapon tests. When Foreign Minister Gromyko made a statement on this issue, the atmosphere in the venue was lively and applause thundered. The Western ambassadors sitting in the VIP box and the Western journalists sitting in the press box were also compelled by the atmosphere of peace-loving throughout the venue to stand up and applaud this great initiative of the Soviet Union. Gromyko said amidst constant applause why the Soviet Union unilaterally announced the cessation of nuclear and hydrogen weapon tests; because nuclear and hydrogen weapon tests would bring disaster to mankind.
    In discussing Gromyko's report, the Soviet Union's most famous atomic physicist, Kurchatov, listed various facts about the disasters brought to mankind by nuclear weapon explosions. Kurchatov said: "We scholars who study atomic physics understand more clearly than others how much misfortune atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs will bring to mankind. I can cite two figures: during World War II, Germany used 1.5 million tons of bombs, and the United States and Britain used 4 million tons. The explosive power of these 5.5 million tons of bombs is only equal to one atomic bomb today. The two atomic bombs dropped by the United States on Japan killed 100,000 people, while today a large atomic bomb can kill millions of people. Recent tests of nuclear and hydrogen weapons have brought great harm to mankind, and if such tests continue, the harm will be even greater." The Soviet Union's unilateral announcement of the decision to cease nuclear and hydrogen weapon tests was warmly supported and welcomed by all delegates. It demonstrated the Soviet people's tenacious will to strive for peace and their ardent concern for the fate of mankind.
    After several days of intense discussions, the general assembly finally adopted the law on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations on the 31st. Comrade Khrushchev made a brief concluding speech before the adoption of the resolution, saying: The law on this issue to be adopted by this assembly is a concern and support for the interests of the whole people. He talked about the methods and ways for collective farms to purchase agricultural machinery; how to help backward farms; how the state can produce and supply machinery and parts in a timely manner; and how to establish inspection groups in collective farms.
    The speeches of more than 40 representatives unanimously pointed out that Comrade Khrushchev's report and the conference's resolutions came from the masses, and now, after discussions by the representatives, they will return to the masses. Concentrating and persevering, this is a concrete manifestation of the most outstanding mass line adopted by the Central Committee of the CPSU. The representatives also unanimously believed that Comrade Khrushchev's report and the law passed by the conference can play a decisive role in further consolidating the collective farm system and further developing the production potential of collective farms in the future. It not only specifically solved the relationship between the two existing ownership systems in production relations, further strengthened the relationship between urban and rural areas, and further consolidated the worker-peasant alliance on a new basis; it provided new conditions for the comprehensive high tide of the Soviet economy.
    Soviet newspapers recently pointed out that the Soviet Union's major achievements in consolidating the collective farm system are mainly due to the continuous opposition to conservatism and dogmatism and the comprehensive great leap forward in economic work in the actual work and theoretical work of the Central Committee of the CPSU in recent years. At present, a high tide of purchasing agricultural machinery has been set off in the vast Russian countryside, and tens of thousands of tractors and other agricultural machines are being transferred to their new owners. The vast number of collective farm members are working intensely on spring plowing preparations. A picture of a great leap forward in agricultural production has already begun to emerge.
    After storms of applause, the conference approved the list of the Soviet government proposed by Khrushchev. The representatives all expressed their belief that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the new government and the efforts of all the Soviet people, they will certainly be able to catch up with and surpass the United States in the output of major products calculated per capita within fifteen years. The Soviet people are now full of confidence and are working hard to advance towards the predetermined goals. This conference is a conference that expresses the peaceful aspirations of the Soviet people, and it is also a conference that politically and ideologically mobilizes the people to boost their energy and move towards a comprehensive leap forward.

    新的里程碑
    本报记者　陈泉璧
    第五届苏联最高苏维埃第一次会议，经过五天的会期，3月31日正式闭幕了。这是一次大跃进的会议。“消息报”在会议开幕时这样评论，在整个历史发展的道路上，这是一座新的里程碑。
    在31日闭幕的会议上，除了宣布苏联政府的组成和就赫鲁晓夫同志所作的报告通过了关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的法律以外，苏联最高苏维埃会议还作出了一件轰动世界和振奋人心的大事，这就是通过了苏联单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器的决议。当外交部长葛罗米柯发表关于这个问题的声明时，会场空气活跃，掌声雷动。坐在贵宾包厢里的西方国家大使和坐在记者席上的西方记者，也被全场热爱和平的空气所迫，不得不为苏联这一伟大的创举而起立鼓掌。葛罗米柯在不断的掌声中讲到，苏联为什么要单方面宣布停止原子武器和氢武器的试验；因为原子武器和氢武器试验会给人类带来灾害。
    在讨论葛罗米柯的报告中，苏联最著名的原子物理学家库尔查托夫列举了原子武器的爆炸给人类带来灾害的种种事实。库尔查托夫说：“我们研究原子物理的学者比别人更清楚了解原子弹和氢弹会给人类带来多大的不幸。我可以引用两个数目字：在第二次大战期间德国用了一百五十万吨炸弹，美英两国用了四百万吨。这五百五十万吨炸弹的爆炸力只等于今天一颗原子弹。美国在日本投下的两颗原子弹炸死了十万人，而今天一颗大型原子弹即可以炸死几百万人。近来原子武器和氢武器的试验给人类带来了很大危害，如果再这样试验下去，那么危害就会更大。”苏联单方面宣布停止原子武器和氢武器试验的决定受到了全体代表热烈拥护和欢迎，它表现了苏联人民争取和平的顽强意志和对于人类命运的殷切关怀。
    在经过几天紧张的讨论后，31日大会最后通过了关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的法律。赫鲁晓夫同志在通过决议前作了简单的总结发言，他说：这次大会即将通过的有关这一问题的法律是对全民利益的关怀和支持。他谈到集体农庄购买农业机器的方式方法问题；如何帮助落后农庄的问题；国家如何及时生产和供应机器和零件问题；在集体农庄如何成立检查小组问题。
    四十多个代表的发言一致指出：赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和会议的决议，是从群众中来的，现在经过代表们的讨论，又要回到群众中去。集中上来，坚持下去，这是苏共中央所采取的最杰出的群众路线的具体表现。代表们也一致认为，赫鲁晓夫同志的报告和会议所通过的法律，对今后进一步巩固集体农庄制度和进一步发展集体农庄生产的潜力，能够起决定的作用。它不但在生产关系上具体地解决了目前存在的两种所有制的关系，进一步加强了城乡的关系，并在新的基础上更加巩固了工农联盟；它为苏联经济的全面高涨提供了新的条件。
    苏联报刊最近指出：苏联在巩固集体农庄制度上所以有这样重大的收获，主要是由于苏共中央几年来在实际工作与理论工作中不断反对保守主义、教条主义和进行经济全面大跃进的结果。目前，广大的俄罗斯乡村，已掀起了一个购买农业机器的高潮，成千成万拖拉机和其它农业机器，正在转给它的新主人。广大的集体农庄庄员，正在紧张地进行着春耕准备。一幅农业生产大跃进的图景已经开始映现出来了。
    大会在风暴般的掌声以后，通过了赫鲁晓夫所提出的苏联政府的名单。代表们都表示相信，在苏共中央和新的政府的领导和全体苏联人民的努力下，十五年内在按人口平均计算的主要产品的产量方面，一定能赶上和超过美国。苏联人民现在正满怀信心地鼓起干劲，向着预定的目标前进。这次大会是表示苏联人民和平热望的大会，也是在政治上和思想上动员人民鼓起干劲、向全面跃进的大会。
