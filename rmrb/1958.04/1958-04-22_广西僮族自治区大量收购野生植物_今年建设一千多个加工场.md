    Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Massively Purchases Wild Plants
    Over a Thousand Processing Plants to be Built This Year

    (Our Nanning dispatch, 21st) The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will vigorously process and utilize wild plants this year. According to incomplete statistics from the commercial departments, the region plans to build 1,269 new wild plant processing plants this year for starch, fiber, oil, and brewing.

    Various localities have already begun to massively purchase various wild plants. Jingxi County purchased 100,000 jin of wild horse-hoof (shan mati) in a single day, which can be used for brewing wine. Farmers in Zuodeng District of Tiandong County sell more than 5,000 jin of wild pineapple (shan boluo, a wild starch raw material) to the state every day.

    Guangxi is extremely rich in wild plants. According to discovered and identified uses, there are approximately 380 types of wild fibers, wild starches, wild oilseeds, and roasted rubber raw materials. Together with newly discovered wild plants, there are more than 600 species in total. Guangxi's wild plants have high yields and good quality. For example, the dragon beard grass (longxucao) used to manufacture high-grade bond paper and typing paper is three to five feet long, and the annual output of the entire region is more than 100 million jin. The pulp made from it can replace wood pulp, saving the state a large amount of timber every year. The litsea cubeba oil processed from litsea cubeba produced in Guangxi is of very good quality, with an average citral content of over 70%. It is widely sold in the international market, earning a large amount of foreign exchange for the country every year. The annual output of litsea cubeba in the entire region is more than 200,000 dan.

    广西僮族自治区大量收购野生植物
    今年建设一千多个加工场
    本报南宁21日电　广西僮族自治区今年将大力加工、利用野生植物。据商业部门的不完全统计，今年计划新建的淀粉、纤维、油料、酿酒等野生植物加工场有一千二百六十九个。
    现在各地已经开始大量收购各种野生植物。靖西县一天就收购了十万斤可供酿酒的山马蹄。田东县作登区的农民每天卖给国家的山菠萝（野生淀粉原料）有五千多斤。
    广西的野生植物极为丰富，据已发现并明确了用途的野生纤维、野生淀粉、野生油料和烤胶等原料约达三百八十多种，加上新发现的野生植物，共计有六百种以上。广西的野生植物产量多，质量好。如制造高级道林纸、打字纸的龙须草，长达三尺至五尺，全区年产量约一亿斤以上。用它制成的纸浆可以代替木浆，每年给国家节约大量的木材。广西所产的山苍籽加工制成的香精油，质量很好，平均含柠檬醛达70％以上，广销国际市场，每年为国家换回大量外汇。全区的山苍籽，年产约二十万担以上。
