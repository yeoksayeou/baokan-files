America Molds into Moldy Country
Poem by Yuan Shuipai, Cartoon by Hua Junwu

The great recession in the American economy,
Has made Old Ike anxious and dazed,
Held meetings all night with no solution,
Cars produced but no one to buy.

Half of the steel factories are shut down,
Small and medium businesses board up their doors,
Long queues at the relief centers,
Unemployment exceeding five million.

America molds into a moldy country,
The prestige of the Soviet Union spreads throughout the world;
America molds into a moldy country,
China's production will increase several times over.

Socialism is full of vigor,
Capitalism is just a silver-plated spearhead;
The cause of peace has a great future,
Cold War policies are doomed to fail. (Attached image)

    美国发霉成霉国
    袁水拍诗  华君武画
    美国经济大衰退，
    急得老艾发了呆，
    连夜开会没法治，
    造了汽车没人买。
    钢铁工厂一半停工，
    中小企业上门板，
    救济处门口排长龙，
    失业人数超过了五百万。
    美国发霉成霉国，
    苏联的威名天下传；
    美国发霉成霉国，
    中国的生产要翻几番。
    社会主义劲头足，
    资本主义是银样腊枪杆；
    和平事业奔头大，
    冷战政策要玩儿完。（附图片）
