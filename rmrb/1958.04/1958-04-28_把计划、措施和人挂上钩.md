Editorial Notes:

    Linking Plans, Measures, and People
    "No planting in spring, no harvest in autumn." This is a correct conclusion drawn by the working people based on thousands of years of experience in production struggles. Now is the busy season for spring planting. Whether spring planting can proceed according to plan is the first hurdle in whether this year's production plan can be realized.
    How can the production plan be well implemented from the very beginning of the production season? The Daqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Shibing County, Guizhou Province, has achieved good results by implementing "three guarantees" and "five fixings." This news tells us that if every cadre and member not only knows the cooperative's overall plan for a great leap forward in production this year, but also knows the measures to achieve the plan, especially if these measures are specific to what to plant on each plot of land, how to plant it, how much labor is required, how much output, and who will plant it, then they have linked the plan, the measures, and the people. In this way, everyone can see the direct relationship between their labor and the realization of the plan, their enthusiasm will naturally be greater, and their sense of responsibility will be generally strengthened.
    Now many places are also engaged in "three guarantees" and "five fixings." This is a good method and should be promoted universally, seizing the opportunity.

    把计划、措施和人挂上钩
    春不种，秋不收。这是劳动人民根据几千年来生产斗争经验得出的正确结论。现在正是春播大忙季节。春播工作能否按计划进行，是今年生产计划能否实现的第一关。
    怎样才能使生产计划在生产刚开始的季节就很好地贯彻呢？贵州施秉县大桥农业社实行“三包”“五定”，收到了很好的效果。这条消息告诉我们，如果每个干部和社员不只是知道今年全社生产大跃进的计划，而且知道了实现计划的措施，特别是这些措施具体到每块地种什么、怎样种、多少工、产多少、谁来种，这样，他们就把计划、措施和人挂上了钩。这样，每个人都能看到自己的劳动和实现计划的直接关系，干劲自然更足了，责任心也普遍加强了。
    现在许多地方也都在搞“三包”“五定”，这是一个好办法，应该抓紧时机普遍推广。
