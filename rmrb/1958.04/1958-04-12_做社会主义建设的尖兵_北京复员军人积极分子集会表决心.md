Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: Over eight hundred demobilized and veteran soldiers and activists from Beijing gathered today to discuss how to be pioneers in socialist construction.

	Cui Zijie, a worker from the Beijing Wired Electric Factory, said that by mid-March, their factory had only completed 40% of the first quarter's production target due to the lack of parts production and supply. At this time, over four hundred demobilized and veteran soldiers organized shock brigades and vanguard teams, leading all the workers in technological innovation and attacking difficulties, finally completing the first quarter's production task two days ahead of schedule. Mi Boxian, a demobilized soldier and forger at the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory who had received four citations for merit, said that he successfully trial-produced a trailer turntable rotator, increasing production efficiency by twenty-seven times. Zhang Heng, manager of the Chongwen District Department Store, who led the Tianqiao Department Store to become an advanced banner in the national commercial system, introduced his work experience at the meeting.

    做社会主义建设的尖兵
    北京复员军人积极分子集会表决心
    据新华社11日讯　北京市八百多个复员转业军人积极分子今天集会，讨论如何做一个社会主义建设的尖兵。
    北京有线电厂工人崔子杰说，他们工厂到3月中旬，由于零件生产供应不上只完成第一季度生产任务的40％，这时四百多个复员转业军人组织了突击队、尖兵队，带动全厂职工革新技术，向困难进攻，最后终于提前两天完成了第一季度的生产任务。曾经立过四次功的复员军人、北京市汽车修理厂锻工糜伯先说，他试制成功挂车转盘回转器，提高了生产效率二十七倍。领导天桥百货商场成为全国商业系统一面先进旗帜的北京市崇文区百货商店经理张恒在会上介绍了他的工作经验。
