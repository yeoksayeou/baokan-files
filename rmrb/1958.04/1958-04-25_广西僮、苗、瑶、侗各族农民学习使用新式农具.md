    Guangxi Zhuang, Miao, Yao, and Dong Farmers Learn to Use New Farm Tools

    Nanning, April 24th (By our own correspondent) In the spring plowing production, the minority areas of the Zhuang, Miao, Yao, and Dong ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, under the slogan of "learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced," have launched a movement to reform farming techniques.

    Yao farmers in the Da Yao mountain area of ​​Nandan County have changed their past farming method of "slash-and-burn agriculture with extensive planting and low yields." This spring, they are plowing, harrowing, and applying dozens of loads of fertilizer per mu, and have learned to use improved rice paddies for raising seedlings for the first time. In the past, they only planted one season a year here. This year, they changed to three seasons—wheat, mid-season rice, and sweet potatoes. Miao farmers in the Greater Miao Mountains, who have always believed that "early rice cannot be grown in high and cold mountainous areas," have broken with old habits this year and are vigorously changing to early rice planting. The county has converted 200,000 mu of single-season rice to double-season rice, four times larger than last year. In the Zhuang-populated areas of western Guangxi, farmers have generally adopted improved rice varieties, changed from sparse planting to dense planting, changed from transplanting in clear water to fertilizing the roots of seedlings, and used medicinal liquid to soak the roots of seedlings to prevent pests.

    Many superstitious customs that hinder production have also been broken by the revolutionary drive of the masses. In the past, Yao farmers in the Da Yao mountain area had to wait for the "spring thunder" every year before the headman of the Yao village broke ground to plow the fields, and then other Yao people could plow the fields. This year, they did not wait for the spring thunder. Around the time of Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects), they began plowing, transplanting, and planting corn, a month earlier than in previous years. Yao farmers in Xishan, Guanyang County, and Miao farmers in the Greater Miao Mountains, have eliminated the historically inherited production "taboo days." This year, on February 2nd and other "taboo days," they are still carrying out spring plowing and planting in a tense manner.

    In order to adapt to the reform of spring plowing techniques, farmers of various ethnic minorities are particularly interested in learning to use new farm tools. The Miao farmers in the Antai area of ​​the Greater Miao Mountains have oxen but do not know how to use walking plows. In the past, they used foot shovels and hoes to dig the ground, which was shallow and inefficient. This spring, they learned to use new walking plows. Now, more than ninety new lightweight walking plows have been purchased in the entire area, and most cooperatives no longer use foot shovels and hoes to dig the ground. In Ningming County, where the Zhuang people live, more than 3,490 "53" walking plows, more than 450 double-wheeled double-share plows, and more than ten new farm tools such as soil crushers and row openers have been promoted this spring.

    广西僮、苗、瑶、侗各族农民学习使用新式农具
    本报南宁24日电　春耕生产中，广西僮族自治区的僮、苗、瑶、侗族等少数民族地区，在“学先进、赶先进”的口号下，掀起了耕作技术改革运动。
    南丹县大瑶寨区瑶族农民，改变了过去“刀耕火种、广种薄收”的耕作方法，今年春天实行犁地、耙地、每亩施肥几十担，第一次学会了用合式秧田育秧。往年这里一年只种一季，今年他们改种三季——小麦、中种、红薯。一向认为“高寒山区不能种早稻”的大苗山苗族农民，今年打破了旧习惯，大力改种早稻，全县单季稻改双季稻二十万亩，比去年扩大四倍。在桂西僮族聚居的地区，农民普遍采用了良种稻，把大株稀植改为小株密植，把清水插秧改为喂秧根肥，并用药液浸秧根防治虫害。
    许多障碍生产的迷信习俗也被群众的革命干劲所冲破。大瑶寨区瑶族农民，过去每年春耕都要等“春雷”响后，瑶寨的头人动土犁田，其他瑶民才能犁田。今年他们不等春雷响，在惊蛰前后，就开始犁田、插秧、种玉米，比往年提前一个月的时间。灌阳县西山的瑶族农民和大苗山苗族农民，革除了历史上遗留下来的生产“忌日”，今年在2月2以及其他的一些“忌日”，仍紧张地进行春耕春种。
    为了适应春耕技术的改革，各少数民族农民学习使用新式农具的兴趣特别浓厚。大苗山安泰区的苗族农民有耕牛但不会使用步犁，往年都是用脚锹、锄头挖地，挖的浅而且效率很低。今春他们学会了使用新式步犁，现在全区已购买了九十多架新式轻便步犁，绝大部分合作社不再用脚锹锄头挖地。在僮族聚居的宁明县，今春推广了三千四百九十多架五三步犁，四百五十多架双轮双铧犁以及新创造的碎土机、开行耙等十多种新式农具。
