Establishing Scientific Institutions at Production Bases
Tianjin Rice Research Institute to be Established in Tuanbowadi, Jinghai
(Our Newspaper's dispatch) In order to further promote the reform of agricultural production technology, a scientific research institution – the "Tianjin Rice Research Institute" – has begun preparations for establishment in the Tianjin area of Hebei Province. This practice of establishing scientific research institutions at agricultural production bases is highly commendable.

The Tianjin area is currently cultivating rice on a large scale. Local farmers' demands for rice yields per mu are no longer just to "cross the Yellow River" but to "cross the Yangtze River." Cadres and the masses are enthusiastically studying scientific technologies such as soil, seed selection, and cultivation. At the same time, due to the large-scale cultivation of rice, there is a severe shortage of labor, and the demand for electrification and mechanization is very urgent. In response to this situation, the Tianjin area is preparing to rely on the technical backbone that has grown up among the local masses to establish a comprehensive agricultural research institute and urgently hopes for support from central research institutions and universities. After learning about the demands of the masses in the Tianjin area, the State Council's Science Planning Commission, the Central Ministry of Agriculture, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Beijing Institute of Water Conservancy Science, and Beijing Agricultural University transferred more than ten senior and mid-level researchers to support the Tianjin area in establishing the institute. On the 3rd, the preparatory office of the "Tianjin Rice Research Institute" was established in Tuanbowadi, Jinghai County, Tianjin area. The Tianjin area has decided to allocate 20,000 mu of paddy fields as the institute's experimental fields.

    在生产基地建立科学机构
    天津稻作研究所在静海团泊洼筹建
    本报讯　为了进一步促进农业生产技术的改革，一个科学研究机构——“天津稻作研究所”，已经在河北省天津专区开始筹建。这种在农业生产基地建立科学研究机构的做法，是十分值得提倡的。
    天津专区目前正在大规模地种植水稻。当地农民对于水稻的亩产量的要求，已不仅是“过黄河”，而是要“过长江”。干部和群众都在热心地钻研土壤、选种、栽培等科学技术。同时，由于大量种植水稻，劳动力十分不足，对于电气化和机械化的要求已很迫切。针对这种情况，天津专区准备依靠当地群众中生长起来的技术骨干建立综合性的农业研究所，并迫切盼望中央各研究机构和高等学校的支援。国务院科学规划委员会、中央农业部、中国农业科学院、北京水利科学研究院和北京农业大学在了解了天津专区群众要求后，调集了十多名高、中级研究人员，支援天津专区建立研究所。3日，在天津专区静海县的团泊洼成立了“天津稻作研究所”筹备处。天津专区决定拨出两万亩的水稻田作为研究所的试验田。
