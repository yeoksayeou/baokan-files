    How Should Book Publishing Emphasize the Present and De-emphasize the Past?
    People's Literature Publishing House Initiates Discussion

    (Our report) The People's Literature Publishing House launched a debate on the issue of book printing numbers during the "Double-Anti" movement. The masses pointed out that the amount of paper used for publishing Chinese classical literature works in 1957 accounted for 45% of the total paper used throughout the year, while the amount of paper used for newly created works, including Soviet literature publications, only accounted for 23%. On the issue of book printing numbers, the masses believed there was a tendency to "emphasize the past and de-emphasize the present."

    During the debate, many different opinions emerged. Some argued that Chinese classical literature masterpieces have stood the test of history and have an extremely broad and deep influence among the working people. The large demand for such books today demonstrates that people's living standards have improved and they need more in their spiritual lives. Moreover, classical literature also has its educational role, so printing more of these books is a good thing, not a bad thing. Another view was that the trend of the reading public demanding the mass publication of Chinese classical literature works is an irresistible objective law of development. This demand should be regarded as normal, and even if one wanted to change this trend, the publishing house would be powerless.

    After extensive debate, the masses believed that these views were one-sided or incorrect. Everyone agreed that the planned and systematic publication of Chinese classical literature works is an important measure to implement the Party's policy on inheriting the national cultural heritage. The publishing house has done some work in this area in the past, and it should continue to strengthen it in the future, organizing and publishing in a more systematic way so that the national heritage can serve socialism. However, this does not mean that the large-scale distribution in the past, accounting for 45% of the publishing house's annual paper consumption, was reasonable. One cannot think that printing more classical literature and printing more works that reflect modern life are roughly the same thing, because the former cannot replace the latter. The basic principle of the publishing house is to educate the people with the spirit of socialism through publications, and the printing numbers of publications must adhere to the principle of "emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past."

    书籍出版如何厚今薄古？
    人民文学出版社展开讨论
    本报讯　人民文学出版社对书籍的印数问题在双反运动中展开了辩论。群众提出了1957年出版中国古典文学作品的用纸量，占了全年总用纸量的45％，而新创作连同苏联文学出版物的用纸量，却只占23％。在书籍印数问题上，群众认为有“厚古薄今”的倾向。
    在争辩中出现了不少不同的意见，这些意见认为，中国的古典文学名著是经过历史考验的，在劳动人民中间有极为深广的影响，今天这类书的需要量大，正是说明了人民的生活水平提高了，在精神生活上需要更多的东西，何况古典文学也有它的教育作用，因此多印这类书是好事情而不是坏事情。还有一种看法，认为读书界要求大量出版中国古典文学作品的趋势，是一个不可抗拒的客观的发展规律，对这种要求应当看作是正常的，即使要改变这种风气，出版社也是无能为力的。
    经过大争大辩，群众认为这些看法是片面的或者是不正确的。大家认为，有计划和有系统地出版中国古典文学作品，是贯彻执行党关于继承民族文化遗产政策的重要措施；过去出版社在这方面做了些工作，今后还要继续加强它，更有系统地整理和出版，让民族遗产为社会主义服务。但是并不等于说，过去在印数上的大量发行，占出版社全年用纸量的45％，就是合理的。不能认为多印古典文学和多印表现现代生活的作品是差不多的事，因为前者不能代替后者。出版社的基本方针，是通过出版物以社会主义精神教育人民，出版物的印数，就必须掌握“厚今薄古”的原则。
