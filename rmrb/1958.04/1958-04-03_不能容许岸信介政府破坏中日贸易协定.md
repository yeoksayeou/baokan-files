The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, signed on March 5, 1958, has been warmly welcomed by the people of both China and Japan. The Chinese people regard the signing of this agreement as a major event in the development of trade and economic exchange between China and Japan. The Chinese government has always supported and assisted the trade activities conducted by non-governmental organizations in China and Japan in the past. On March 7, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, when meeting with Yamamoto Kumaichi, President of Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and Nango Saburo, Chairman of the Japan-China Export-Import Association, also clearly expressed his welcome and support for the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The Japanese media, progressive parties, people's organizations, business figures, and enlightened members of the Japanese Diet have also reacted very enthusiastically to this agreement. The "Asahi Shimbun" reported the signing of the agreement under the headline "Trade Circles Rejoice"; the "Yomiuri Shimbun" editorial stated that the signing of this agreement "marks a new starting point for Japan-China trade"; leaders of many Japanese mass organizations believe that they must unite the strength of the people to promote the full implementation of the agreement; the Japan Socialist Party has also decided to use the strength of the entire party to implement the agreement. All this shows how the Japanese people support and endorse the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

However, the attitude of the Kishida Nobusuke government and some responsible figures in the ruling party is completely the opposite. On the eve of the visit of the Japanese trade delegation to China to sign the agreement, they deliberately created obstacles by putting forward four so-called "matters of understanding" in an attempt to tamper with the basic principles of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. After the agreement was signed, the Kishida Nobusuke government continued to delay and hesitate to express its support for the agreement, attempting to obstruct its implementation. Due to the continuous pressure from the United States and the instigation of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to take threatening measures against the Japanese government, Kishida Nobusuke further wrote a letter to the Chiang Kai-shek clique, guaranteeing that the Japanese government would never recognize the People's Republic of China, would not give "privileges" to Chinese commercial representative offices, and would not recognize the right of Chinese commercial representative offices to fly the national flag. This clearly shows that the Kishida Nobusuke government is preparing to overturn the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

Kishida Nobusuke's action once again exposes that he wants to be hostile to the 600 million Chinese people. We cannot remain silent about this.

Kishida Nobusuke has repeatedly stated that the Japanese government will never recognize the People's Republic of China, and has repeatedly emphasized the "friendly relations" between the Japanese government and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique. This is not news at all. The Kishida Nobusuke government has always openly followed the United States in its attitude towards the new China, following suit in every step. It is precisely because of this attitude of the Kishida Nobusuke government that the state of war between China and Japan has not yet been lifted, and diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not yet been restored.

The Kishida Nobusuke government's attitude towards China is contrary to the will of the majority of the Japanese people. After the Second World War, with the change in Japan's situation, the feelings between the Chinese and Japanese people also underwent fundamental changes. The Chinese people did not dwell on the past and expressed sincere friendly wishes to the Japanese people. The Japanese people have also actively strived to promote the friendship between the people of China and Japan, and urgently demanded the early restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. For more than eight years, the people of China and Japan have had frequent and extensive contacts, and the most valuable thing is that the people of the two countries have broken the conventions of international relations and signed forty agreements through consultations between non-governmental organizations of the two countries, directly addressing some issues related to common interests. The Chinese government has always welcomed and supported this fruitful contact between the people of China and Japan. However, the Kishida Nobusuke government has not only failed to take corresponding actions, but has also obstructed and undermined it. For example, last year, the Kishida Nobusuke government fabricated the issue of 35,000 Japanese people "missing" in China, attempting to confuse the public and undermine the friendship between the people of China and Japan; on the contrary, the Kishida Nobusuke government has never made any responsible explanations for the missing Chinese people who were taken to Japan by the invading Japanese army during the war, and recently even attempted to subject Liu Lianren, who had suffered fourteen years of hardship, to new persecution. All this cannot but arouse great indignation among the people of China and Japan.

The movement of the Japanese people demanding the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations has become an increasingly powerful force that cannot be ignored in Japanese political life. The increasingly serious Japanese economic recession makes Sino-Japanese trade of greater importance to Japan. Under such circumstances, even Kishida Nobusuke cannot but say that he is "willing to work to expand Sino-Japanese trade." However, this is only to alleviate the pressure on the government from the Japanese people, to solve Japan's economic recession, and does not mean in the slightest that Kishida Nobusuke has changed his attitude of being hostile to the Chinese people. Precisely because of this, while claiming that he is "willing to work to expand Sino-Japanese trade," Kishida Nobusuke always particularly emphasizes the "friendly relations" between the Japanese government and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique. On the other hand, Kishida Nobusuke uses the widespread movement of the Japanese people demanding the expansion of Sino-Japanese trade and the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries as a bargaining chip for him to bargain with the United States. This is hoping to win more crumbs from the United States under the fundamental condition of complying with the United States, and does not mean in the slightest that the Kishida Nobusuke government has dared to break away from the control of the United States and adopt a more independent policy. The most obvious proof is that the Kishida Nobusuke government is following the US government in carrying out the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," and is actively seeking arguments and paving the way for this conspiracy. Of course, the Kishida Nobusuke government also has its own plans in creating "two Chinas." Its consistent protection and support for the so-called "Taiwan Independence League" of Liao Wenyi group exposes its potential imperialist ambitions for Taiwan.

Kishida Nobusuke thinks that his method is very clever, he wants to gain from Sino-Japanese trade, but also wants to rip off the United States, and also wants to undermine the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This two-faced approach can only put oneself in a situation of being besieged on all sides. Isn't the current situation of the Japanese government precisely like this?

The Chinese government sympathizes with the Japanese people's urgent desire to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and is also willing to make active efforts to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan. However, as long as the Kishida Nobusuke government continues to be hostile to the Chinese people and continues to maintain the so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, it will be impossible for China and Japan to restore diplomatic relations, and there will be no talk of mutual recognition. The Chinese government hopes to see the continuous development of trade between China and Japan, because this is in the interests of the people of both countries and is conducive to the friendship between the people of the two countries. However, if the Kishida Nobusuke government believes that China has any economic difficulties, and even if the Kishida Nobusuke government adopts an open hostile attitude towards the Chinese people, China must trade with Japan, then it is completely wrong. China has always emphasized self-reliance, and has the mutual cooperation and support of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Kishida Nobusuke government should abandon any of its illusions as soon as possible.

Kishida Nobusuke attempts to give the impression that the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement has given some "privileges" to Chinese commercial representative offices. This is a malicious fabrication, a deliberately created excuse to undermine the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. In the past, the Chinese people suffered deeply from the imperialist aggression and plunder by relying on privileges. The Chinese people who have turned over will neither allow any foreign country to enjoy privileges in our country, nor will they ever ask other countries to give us privileges. The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement does make specific provisions to ensure the safety of non-governmental commercial representative offices and their staff in both China and Japan and to facilitate their work. These specific provisions are necessary to ensure the smooth execution of the tasks of the commercial representative offices of both parties. These provisions apply to both parties and are not "privileges" at all. If Kishida Nobusuke insists on saying that these provisions are "privileges," then Japanese commercial representative offices will also enjoy these so-called "privileges." Kishida Nobusuke fabricates a so-called "privilege" issue out of thin air and makes a big fuss about it. This can only be for one purpose, that is, to overturn the specific provisions in the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement in the name of canceling "privileges," making it impossible for Chinese commercial representative offices to perform their tasks, thereby undermining the implementation of the trade agreement.

The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement stipulates that the commercial representative offices of both parties have the right to fly their own national flags. This was originally an extremely ordinary provision. However, Kishida Nobusuke singled out this provision for attack and arbitrarily refused to recognize the right of Chinese commercial representative offices to fly the Chinese national flag. His argument cannot stand at all. Our country's commodity exhibitions held in Japan and Japan's commodity exhibitions held in our country have all flown their own national flags, and the Japanese commodity exhibition currently held in China also flies the Japanese flag. Since the Kishida Nobusuke government did not raise any objections in the past, what reason is there to oppose it now? Flying one's own national flag is an inalienable right of a country's citizens, even when residing abroad. If Kishida Nobusuke is not deliberately tearing up the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, what reason does he have not to recognize the right of Chinese commercial representative offices to fly the Chinese national flag? It is especially worth noting that the Policy Affairs Research Council of the Liberal Democratic Party believes that Article 92 of the Japanese Criminal Law, which stipulates that acts of damaging foreign national flags will be punished, does not apply to the People's Republic of China. This means that the Kishida Nobusuke government is not only preparing to deprive Chinese commercial representative offices of the right to fly the Chinese national flag, but also will condone insults to the Chinese national flag, making it impossible for Chinese commercial representative offices to perform their tasks in Japan.

The Kishida Nobusuke government's various conspiracies to undermine the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement are intolerable to the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people have, past, present, and future, cherished extremely friendly wishes for the Japanese people, and will never change because of the hostile attitude of the Kishida Nobusuke government. We believe that the Japanese people and the three Japanese organizations responsible for signing the agreement will make due efforts to safeguard the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and ensure its smooth implementation.

### 不能容许岸信介政府破坏中日贸易协定

    不能容许岸信介政府破坏中日贸易协定
    第四次中日贸易协定在1958年3月5日签订以后，受到了中日两国人民的热烈欢迎。中国人民把这次协定的签订看成是中日两国在发展贸易和经济交流方面的一件大事。中国政府一向支持和协助中日两国民间团体过去所进行的贸易活动。3月7日，陈毅副总理兼外交部长在接见日本国际贸易促进会会长山本熊一和日中输出入组合理事长南乡三郎的时候，对于第四次中日贸易协定也明确地表示了欢迎和支持的态度。日本舆论界、进步党派、人民团体、工商界人士和日本国会议员中的开明人士对于这次协定的反应也是十分热烈的。“朝日新闻”用“兴高采烈的贸易界”作标题来报导这次协定的签订；“读卖新闻”的社论说，这次协定的签订“标志着日中贸易的新的起点”；日本许多群众团体的领导人认为今后要团结人民的力量，促使协定全面实施；日本社会党也决定以全党的力量来使协定付诸实施。这一切说明日本人民是如何拥护和支持第四次中日贸易协定。
    但是，日本岸信介政府和执政党中一部分负责人士的态度却截然相反。他们在日本访华通商使节团来我国签订协定的前夕，就曾经横生枝节地故意刁难，提出所谓“谅解事项”四条，企图篡改第四次中日贸易协定的基本原则。协定签字以后，岸信介政府又一直借辞拖延，迟迟不对协定表示支持，企图阻碍协定的实施。由于美国不断施加压力，并且指使台湾蒋介石集团对日本政府采取威胁性措施，岸信介竟进一步写信向蒋介石集团保证：日本政府绝对不承认中华人民共和国，不给中国商务代表机构“特权”，不承认中国商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗。这就再清楚不过地说明，岸信介政府是在为推翻第四次中日贸易协定进行准备。
    岸信介的这一行动再一次地暴露他是要同六万万中国人民为敌的。对此，我们不能保持沉默。
    岸信介三番五次地声明日本政府绝对不承认中华人民共和国，并且反复强调日本政府同台湾蒋介石集团的“友好关系”。这丝毫也不是新闻。岸信介政府在对待新中国的问题上，从来就是露骨地跟在美国后边，亦步亦趋。正是由于岸信介政府的这种态度，中日两国之间的战争状态至今还没有解除，中日两国的外交关系至今还没有恢复。
    岸信介政府对待中国的态度是同日本大多数人民的意志相违背的。二次大战以后，随着日本处境的改变，中日两国人民之间的感情也起了根本的变化。中国人民不究既往，向日本人民表示了真诚的友好愿望。日本人民也积极地为促进中日两国人民的友谊而努力，并且迫切地要求中日早日恢复邦交。八年多以来，中日两国人民进行了频繁和广泛的接触，而最可贵的是两国人民打破了国际关系的常规，通过两国民间性团体的协商，签订了四十个协议，直接地处理了某些有关共同利益的问题。中国政府一贯欢迎和支持中日两国人民之间这种富有成效的接触。但是，岸信介政府不仅没有采取相应的行动，而且还进行阻挠和破坏。例如，去年岸信介政府就无中生有地提出在中国“下落不明”的三万五千名日本人的问题，企图混淆视听，破坏中日两国人民的友谊；相反地，对于在战争期间被日本侵略军队携到日本去的下落不明的中国人，岸信介政府却一直不作任何负责的交代，最近竟企图对饱受十四年苦难的刘连仁进行新的迫害。凡此种种，不能不引起中日两国人民极大的愤慨。
    日本人民要求恢复日中邦交的运动已经成为日本政治生活中日益不容忽视的强大力量。越来越严重的日本经济衰退使中日贸易对日本具有更加重要的意义。在这样的情况下，甚至岸信介也不能不说“愿意为扩大中日贸易而努力”。但是，这只是为了缓和日本人民对政府的压力，为了解救日本的经济衰退，丝毫也不意味着岸信介改变了他要同中国人民为敌的态度。正是因为这样，岸信介在声称“愿意为扩大中日贸易而努力”的同时，总是特别强调日本政府同台湾蒋介石集团的“友好关系”。另一方面，岸信介又利用日本人民要求扩大中日贸易和恢复两国外交关系的广泛运动，作为他向美国讨价还价的资本。这是在基本上顺从美国的情况下，希望争得美国更多的餕余，丝毫也不意味着岸信介政府已经敢于摆脱美国的控制，而采取较独立的政策。最明显的证明就是岸信介政府追随着美国政府进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋，并且积极地为这个阴谋寻找论据，开辟道路。当然，岸信介政府在制造“两个中国”方面也还有自己的打算，它一贯地包庇和扶持所谓“台湾独立同盟”的廖文毅集团，就暴露了它对台湾的潜在的帝国主义野心。
    岸信介以为自己的手法很聪明，既想在中日贸易中捞一把，又要敲美国的竹杠，还想挖蒋介石集团的墙脚。这种两面三刀的手法，结果只能使自己处于四面楚歌的境地。日本政府目前的处境不正是这样吗？
    中国政府同情日本人民要求恢复中日邦交的迫切愿望，并且也愿意积极努力使中日两国的外交关系得到恢复。但是，只要岸信介政府继续敌视中国人民，继续保持同台湾蒋介石集团的所谓“外交关系”，中日两国就不可能恢复外交关系，也谈不到彼此承认。中国政府希望看到中日两国的贸易不断发展，因为这符合两国人民的利益，也有利于两国人民的友好。但是，如果岸信介政府认为，中国有什么经济困难，即使岸信介政府对中国人民采取露骨的敌视态度，中国也非同日本进行贸易不可，那就大错而特错了。中国向来强调自力更生，而且有强大的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的相互协作和支持。岸信介政府最好早点放弃它的任何错觉。
    岸信介企图使人得到一种印象，似乎第四次中日贸易协定使中国商务代表机构得到了什么“特权”。这是恶意的捏造，这是为了破坏第四次中日贸易协定而故意制造出来的借口。过去，中国人民曾经深受帝国主义凭借特权进行侵略和掠夺的苦痛。翻了身的中国人民，既不会容许任何外国在我国享有特权，也绝不会要求别的国家给我们特权。第四次中日贸易协定的确作出了具体的规定，使中日双方民间性的商务代表机构及其所属人员在对方国家得到安全保证和进行工作的方便。这些具体规定是保证双方商务代表机构顺利执行任务所必需的。这些规定适用于双方，根本不是什么“特权”。如果岸信介硬要说这些规定是“特权”，那么，日本商务代表机构将同样享受这些他所谓的“特权”。岸信介凭空捏造出一个所谓“特权”问题，并且借题大作文章，这只能是为了一个目的，那就是企图以取消“特权”为名，推翻第四次中日贸易协定中的具体规定，使中国商务代表机构无法执行任务，从而破坏贸易协定的实施。
    第四次中日贸易协定中规定双方商务代表机构有权悬挂本国国旗。这本来是一条极其平常的规定。但是，岸信介特别抽出这一条规定来加以攻击，并且蛮横地不承认中国商务代表机构有权悬挂中国国旗。他的论点是无论如何也站不住的。我国在日本举行的商品展览会和日本在我国举行的商品展览会，都曾经挂过本国国旗，而且现在在中国举行的日本商品展览会也还挂着日本国旗。既然岸信介政府过去没有提出异议，现在有什么理由加以反对？悬挂本国国旗，是一国的公民不可剥夺的权利，甚至侨居在外国的时候也是如此。岸信介如果不是蓄意撕毁第四次中日贸易协定，有什么理由不承认中国商务代表机构悬挂中国国旗的权利？尤其值得注意的是，自由民主党的政务调查会竟认为，日本刑法第九十二条关于损毁外国国旗的行为将加以处罚的规定，是不适用于中华人民共和国的。这就是说，岸信介政府不仅准备剥夺中国商务代表机构悬挂中国国旗的权利，而且还将纵容侮辱中国国旗的行为，使中国商务代表机构无法在日本执行任务。
    岸信介政府企图破坏第四次中日贸易协定的种种阴谋，是中国人民所不能容忍的。但是，中国人民对于日本人民，过去，现在，以至将来，都怀着极其友好的愿望，决不会因为岸信介政府的敌视态度而有所改变。我们相信，日本人民和负责签字的日本三团体会作出应有的努力，来维护第四次中日贸易协定，并且使这个协定得到顺利的实施。
