Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, April 22nd: Over three hundred representatives from various Lhasa organizations, military units stationed in Tibet, groups, ethnic groups, and sectors held a symposium today to celebrate the second anniversary of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.

General Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet, attended and offered congratulations. Also present to offer congratulations were Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, and leading cadres from the Tibet Military Region. Leading cadres from various sub-working committees and work teams who are in Lhasa participating in the CPC Tibet Working Committee's rectification meeting also attended the symposium.

The Dalai Lama, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke at the symposium. Bainqen Erdini, First Vice Chairman, remained in Xigaze due to official business, and his written speech was read at the symposium. In their speeches, both the Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini briefly described the major work achievements made since the establishment of the Preparatory Committee, under the wise leadership and care of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the direct leadership of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, as well as the future work tasks. They jointly emphasized that to change the backwardness of Tibet in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, and to make Tibet increasingly prosperous and happy, taking the socialist road is certain. They also pointed out that the central government, based on the current specific situation in Tibet, has decided not to carry out democratic reforms during the second five-year plan period. During this period, it is necessary to earnestly prepare ideologically for democratic reforms and actively create conditions.

The Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini strongly condemned the sabotage activities carried out by imperialist elements and separatist elements against Tibet. They encouraged all cadres to strengthen unity with all fraternal ethnic groups in the country and internal unity within Tibet, overcome tendencies toward local nationalism, and rouse revolutionary vigor. Under the banner of anti-imperialism, patriotism, unity, and progress, they should work together along the socialist road to strive for the early formal establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

Zhang Guohua, Second Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, elaborated on the importance of opposing local nationalism and Han chauvinism in Tibet in his speech. He said: "In the past few years, we have emphasized opposing Han chauvinism, which is completely correct; however, based on the current situation, while continuing to oppose Han chauvinism, we must also raise the issue of opposing local nationalism. Otherwise, if local nationalism develops, it will endanger the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity, and it will seriously hinder the development and progress of the Tibetan people, and may even prevent them from ever escaping poverty and backwardness."

Next, Zhang Jingwu spoke on behalf of the representatives, saying, "Today is the second anniversary of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Over the past two years, under the direct leadership of the Dalai Lama, Bainqen Erdini, and the CPC Tibet Working Committee, relying on the active efforts of all Tibetan and Han cadres and the support of the broad masses of people from all strata in Tibet, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has achieved important successes in all aspects of its work. First of all, in the past two years, Tibetan and Han cadres have been able to get along closely in their cooperation, helping each other, learning from each other, and consulting on matters, thereby greatly enhancing the unity between Tibetan and Han cadres; and the close unity of Tibetan and Han cadres has promoted the development and consolidation of unity between Tibetan and Han nationalities and within Tibet; on this basis, the relationship between the central government and the Tibetan local government has become even closer. Secondly, with the progress of various tasks, the Preparatory Committee's prestige among the Tibetan people is gradually increasing; at the same time, a group of cadres have been trained and cultivated in various practical tasks, their working ability and professional level have been improved to a certain extent, and they have also accumulated certain work experience; through regular political study, the cadres' political ideology and awareness have also been improved, and their patriotism has been newly enhanced. These achievements have laid some foundations for the future establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Today, I would like to extend warm congratulations to Chairman Dalai Lama, Bainqen Erdini, Vice Chairman Zhang Guohua, and all friends and comrades working in the Preparatory Committee."

Zhang Jingwu said, "The implementation of ethnic regional autonomy is one of the basic policies of the Chinese Communist Party to solve the ethnic problems in our country by applying the Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic issues, combined with the historical development and specific conditions of our country. Our country has achieved great successes in implementing the policy of ethnic regional autonomy. In recent years, more than sixty ethnic autonomous areas of various sizes have been established, including the three autonomous regions that have been established and the two autonomous regions that are being prepared for establishment. In minority areas that have already achieved regional autonomy, their political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings have all been greatly developed. The main task of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is to prepare for the implementation of regional autonomy in the Tibet region in accordance with the provisions of our country's constitution, the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and the specific conditions in Tibet. This task is very glorious and arduous, and I firmly believe that under the glorious light of the great ethnic policy of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the direct leadership of the Dalai Lama, Bainqen Erdini, and the CPC Tibet Working Committee, and with the unity, concerted efforts, and active work of all Tibetan and Han cadres in the Preparatory Committee, we will certainly be able to further strengthen ethnic unity, consolidate the unification of the motherland, oppose separatist activities, strengthen the training of ethnic cadres, gradually and thoroughly implement the seventeen-article agreement, accumulate work experience, create various conditions, and complete the glorious task of formally establishing a unified Tibet Autonomous Region."

Zhang Jingwu then spoke about the international situation of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind" and the situation of the socialist great leap forward across the country. He concluded by saying, "Due to different social conditions and circumstances, Tibet is currently unable to carry out a great leap forward in construction like other parts of the country, but we can have a great leap forward politically and ideologically. We can make a leap forward in strengthening ethnic unity and enhancing patriotism. I hope that all cadres of the Preparatory Committee will first make a leap forward in strengthening learning, raising political awareness, enhancing ethnic unity, and enhancing patriotism."

Today, the Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini also sent telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao and the State Council respectively.

Commemorative activities were also held in other major towns in Tibet today.

    庆祝西藏自治区筹委会成立两周年
    拉萨各族各界代表举行座谈会
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼号召加强民族团结克服地方民族主义倾向
    新华社拉萨22日电　拉萨市各机关、驻军、团体和各族各界代表三百多人，今天举行座谈会，庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会成立两周年。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表张经武将军到会祝贺。前来祝贺的，还有中共西藏工委副书记范明和西藏军区的负责干部。正在拉萨参加中共西藏工委干部整风会议的各分工委和工作队的负责干部也出席了座谈会。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员达赖喇嘛在座谈会上讲了话。第一副主任委员班禅额尔德尼因公留住日喀则，座谈会上宣读了他的书面讲话。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在讲话中都扼要叙述了筹委会成立以来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导与关怀下，在中共西藏工委的直接领导下所获得的主要工作成绩以及今后的工作任务。他们共同强调：要改变西藏政治、经济、文化等各方面的落后面貌，使西藏日益繁荣幸福，走社会主义的道路是肯定的，他们还指出：中央根据西藏目前的具体情况，确定在第二个五年计划期间不进行民主改革，在这段时间里必须认真作好民主改革的思想准备工作，积极创造条件。
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼痛斥了帝国主义分子和分离主义分子对西藏进行的破坏活动。他们勉励全体干部要加强和全国各兄弟民族的团结和西藏内部的团结，克服地方民族主义的倾向；鼓起革命干劲，在反帝爱国、团结进步的旗帜下，沿着社会主义的道路，为争取早日正式成立西藏自治区而共同努力奋斗。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会第二副主任委员张国华在讲话中，阐述了在西藏反对地方民族主义和大汉族主义的重要性。他说：“过去几年来，曾着重讲了反对大汉族主义，这是完全正确的；但根据目前情况，在继续反对大汉族主义的同时，就必须提出反对地方民族主义。否则，地方民族主义发展下去，就会危害祖国的统一和民族团结，就会使西藏人民的发展进步受到严重的阻碍，甚至永远不能摆脱那种贫困落后的状态。”
    接着，张经武代表讲话，他说：“今天是西藏自治区筹备委员会成立两周年纪念。两年来，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和中共西藏工委的直接领导下，依靠全体藏汉族干部的积极努力，和西藏各阶层广大人民群众的拥护和支持，西藏自治区筹备委员会在各方面的工作中，取得了重要的成就。首先，两年来藏汉族干部在合作共事中，大家互相之间都能亲密相处，团结互助，互相学习，协商办事，因而大大地增进了藏汉族干部之间的团结；而藏汉族干部的亲密团结，则促进了藏汉民族间和西藏内部团结的发展和巩固；在此基础上，中央和西藏地方的关系也更进一步密切了。其次，随着各项工作的进行，筹委会在西藏人民中的威信正在逐步提高；同时在各项实际工作中锻炼和培养了一批干部，他们的工作能力和业务水平得到了一定程度的提高，也积累了一定的工作经验；通过经常性的政治学习，也提高了干部的政治思想和认识水平，他们的爱国主义思想有了新的提高。这些成就给将来成立西藏自治区打下了一些基础。今天我特向达赖喇嘛主任委员、班禅额尔德尼和张国华副主任委员以及在筹委会工作的朋友们、同志们致以热烈的祝贺。”
    张经武说：“实行民族区域自治，是中国共产党运用马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的学说，结合我国历史的发展和具体情况，解决我国民族问题的基本政策之一。我国在实行民族区域自治政策方面，取得了重大的成就。几年来建立了大小六十多个民族自治地方，其中包括已成立的三个自治区和两个正在筹备成立的自治区。已经实现了区域自治的少数民族聚居地区，其政治、经济、文化建设事业均得到了很大的发展。西藏自治区筹备委员会的主要任务是，依据我国的宪法规定，以及和平解放西藏办法的协议，和西藏的具体情况，筹备在西藏地区实行区域自治。这一任务是非常光荣的而又是艰巨的，我坚信在党中央和毛主席的伟大的民族政策的光辉照耀下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和中共西藏工委的直接领导下，以及在筹委会全体藏汉族干部团结无间、共同努力、积极工作下，一定能够进一步加强民族团结，巩固祖国的统一，反对分裂活动，加强培养民族干部，逐步彻底实现协议十七条，积累工作经验，创造各种条件，完成正式成立统一的西藏自治区的这一光荣任务。”
    张经武接着谈到了国际上“东风压倒西风”的形势和全国社会主义大跃进的情况。他最后说：“西藏由于社会条件和情况不同，目前，还不可能和全国各地一样，在建设方面进行大跃进，但是我们可以从政治上和思想上来个大跃进。在增强民族团结和提高爱国主义思想方面进行跃进。我希望筹委会的全体干部，首先在加强学习，提高政治认识，增强民族团结，提高爱国主义思想方面来一个跃进。”
    今天，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼还向毛主席和国务院分别发出了致敬电。
    在西藏其他各主要城镇，今天也举行了纪念活动。
