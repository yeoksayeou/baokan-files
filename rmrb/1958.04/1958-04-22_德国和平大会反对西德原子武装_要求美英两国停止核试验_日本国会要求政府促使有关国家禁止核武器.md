Xinhua News Agency, April 21st, Leipzig News: The German Peace Congress was held in Leipzig from the 18th to the 20th. There were 1,250 delegates present, including 250 representatives of the West German peace movement. Attendees also included Jones, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, and guests from nineteen countries.

The congress heard a report by Professor Friedrich, Chairman of the German Peace Committee, entitled "Our Contribution to the Worldwide Peace Movement," and a report by Willmann, Secretary-General of the German Peace Committee, entitled "The Peace Movement in the German Democratic Republic on the Eve of the Stockholm Peace Conference." In his report, Friedrich welcomed the Soviet Union's peace policy, especially the Soviet decision to unilaterally cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, and he suggested that the congress delegates call on the U.S. and British governments to follow the example of the Soviet government.

The congress passed a declaration accusing West German atomic armament of hindering German unification and called for a referendum on the issue of West German atomic armament. The declaration demanded that Western governments also make a decision, like the Soviet Union, to cease testing atomic weapons.

The congress passed a motion amidst stormy applause from the delegates to write a letter in the name of the congress to the U.S. and British governments, calling on them to follow the Soviet Union's example and cease testing atomic weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, April 21st, Berlin News from TASS: The Council of the Free German Trade Union Federation of the German Democratic Republic sent a letter to the Council of the West German Trade Union Federation, suggesting that an agreement for joint action be concluded on the issue of opposing the threat of atomic war.

Xinhua News Agency, April 21st, Berlin News from TASS: Some leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party delivered speeches at mass rallies in many cities on the 19th, reiterating their opposition to equipping the West German army with atomic weapons and demanding improved relations with countries of the socialist camp.

According to a report by the German News Agency, the Chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, said at a mass rally organized by the local "Committee Against Atomic Death Struggle" in Duisburg, "We should do our best to ensure that the Bonn government has no possibility of realizing atomic armament. We will fight to win a referendum." Ollenhauer advocated that West Germany should reach mutual understanding with socialist countries and establish diplomatic relations with Eastern European countries.

In his speech, Ollenhauer emphasized that the Western countries can only respond to the Soviet government's decision with a cessation of testing.

Hai'man, a member of the Social Democratic Party in the Federal Parliament, spoke at a mass rally in Frankfurt on the Main River against atomic armament. He warned against retracing the path that "once led the German people to crime and disaster." Hai'man advocated the establishment of a European nuclear-free zone.

Xinhua News Agency, April 21st, Tokyo News: The Japanese Diet's House of Councillors passed a resolution on "Prohibiting Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs" jointly proposed by the Socialist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and the Ryokufukai at a plenary session held this morning.

The resolution requires the Japanese government to actively take diplomatic measures to urge countries possessing atomic and hydrogen bombs to quickly reach an agreement on the immediate and unconditional cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen bombs, and to urge relevant countries to further sign an agreement prohibiting the manufacture, storage, and use of atomic and hydrogen bombs.

Prior to this, the Japanese House of Representatives also passed a resolution on prohibiting atomic and hydrogen bomb tests on April 18.

Xinhua News Agency, April 21st, Tokyo News: The Labor Women's Conference, organized by the Women's Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) and other trade unions, passed a resolution on the 20th, demanding that the U.S. and British governments immediately cease nuclear weapons testing and agree to hold East-West summit talks.

The conference passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese government refuse the U.S. to transport nuclear weapons into Japanese territory, and protesting against the Japanese government's forced implementation of the "Performance Appraisal" system that oppresses teachers.

The conference also passed a resolution deciding to raise funds to support the Algerian people who are waging a fierce struggle for their national independence.
