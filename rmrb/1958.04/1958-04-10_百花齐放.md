    Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    Peonies, people all demean us as "slaves of flowers,"
    But we are unwilling to suffer such humiliation.
    We have lived meekly for who knows how many years,
    Now the slaves have stood up, and the people are the masters.
    We bloom today, we are doubly spirited,
    Each of our flowers and leaves is for the people.
    The butterflies' midday dreams are lighter and more delicate,
    The honeybees' nectar is purer than before.

    Winter Jasmine
    Spring has come, our flowers bloom relatively early,
    Golden little trumpets, covering the branches.
    Many flowers, a long flowering period, perhaps these are our advantages,
    But lacking fragrance, it must be admitted, is a bit monotonous.
    However, our branches are still quite supple,
    Allowing gardeners to twist them at will.
    The tender green leaves do not easily change color,
    Barely passable in seasons lacking flowers.

    Malus spectabilis (Chinese Flowering Crabapple)
    Our temperament tends to favor liveliness,
    Flowers clustered together in the sunlight, truly heavenly.
    Thousands of bees fly to the branches to linger,
    The symphony of spring is our highest performance.
    People might say, "You are showy but impractical,"
    But if the bees voted, it would be vetoed.
    Beautiful art can increase production enthusiasm,
    If there were unfruitful flowers, where would the honey come from?

    Dandelion
    We don't covet the gold that people treasure,
    For in an instant, we can turn gold into silver.
    Silver seeds, a group of airborne troops,
    But we are dropping life into the earth.
    Chinese doctors know our medicinal properties,
    They will use us to treat illnesses and save people.
    Very good, we truly love China,
    We are children of the earth, also known as Diding (Viola yedoensis).

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    芍药人们都贬谪我们是“花之奴”，
    我们却不愿受这样的污辱。
    我们委曲地不知过了多少年，
    如今是奴隶翻身，人民作了主。
    花开在今天，我们是倍有精神，
    我们的一花一叶都是为了人民。
    蝴蝶们的午梦睡得来更加轻巧，
    蜜蜂们的蜜汁比以前更加清淳。
    迎春花
    春天来了，我们的花开得比较早，
    金黄色的小小喇叭，压满了枝条。
    花多，花期长，或许是我们的好处，
    缺少香气，认真说是有点儿单调。
    不过，我们的枝条还相当的柔软，
    可以让园艺家们作任意的蟠缠。
    嫩绿的叶子也不容易改变颜色，
    在缺少花的时节勉强可以过关。
    西府海棠
    我们的性情倒是比较喜欢热闹，
    花团锦簇在太阳光里真是天骄。
    千万个蜜蜂们飞到枝头来缭绕，
    春之交响乐是我们演奏得最高。
    人们或许会说，“你们是华而不实，”
    但让蜜蜂们投票就会遭到否决。
    优美的艺术可以提高生产热情，
    如有不实的繁花，哪儿得来蜂蜜？
    蒲公英
    倒不稀罕人们所宝贵的黄金，
    在转瞬间会把黄金变成白银。
    银色的种籽，是一团空降部队，
    但我们是向大地中投下生命。
    中国大夫知道我们的药性，
    他们会用我们来治病救人。
    很好，我们实在是热爱中国，
    我们是大地之子，别名地丁。（附图片）
