Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions dispatched five employee mountaineering athletes to the Jingtieshan mining area in Gansu today to assist the geological exploration team in mountain exploration and review. This marks the beginning of cooperation between China's mountaineering movement and geological exploration work.

The five employee mountaineering athletes are: Xu Jing, Liu Dayi (Master of Sports), Liu Lianman (Master of Sports), Peng Shuli, and Zhang Junyan. They are all outstanding mountaineering experts who have conquered "Father of Ice Mountains" - Muztagh Ata or climbed the King of Mountains - Mount Gongga.

Jingtieshan belongs to the Qilian Mountains and is located southwest of Jiuquan City. In 1955, geological exploration personnel found large pieces of bright black specular hematite outcrops in this area, hence it was named "Jingtieshan" (Mirror Iron Mountain). The iron ore buried here is enough to build a large-scale iron and steel complex.

Jingtieshan is about 5,100 meters above sea level, and the summit area above 5,000 meters is a year-round snow-covered zone, with a snow depth of about 30 meters. The average slope of the mountain is 30 degrees, and the steepest part is about 55 degrees. The geological exploration team under the Ministry of Geology could only operate in areas 3,000 meters above sea level during the preliminary survey phase. Last year, although the geological exploration team organized young and strong personnel to carry the lightest equipment and attempted to climb the summit of Jingtieshan many times, they ultimately failed due to lack of mountaineering skills and experience. After receiving a request for support from the Ministry of Geology, the Sports Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions immediately decided to send people to assist.

April to July is the best season for the climate in Jingtieshan throughout the year. After July, there are often heavy snowstorms. Therefore, the mountaineering athletes decided to cooperate with the geological exploration personnel to climb Jingtieshan in April.

### 协助地质勘探队登山勘探  爬山运动健将远征镜铁山

    协助地质勘探队登山勘探
    爬山运动健将远征镜铁山
    新华社10日讯　中华全国总工会今天派出五名职工爬山运动员到甘肃镜铁山矿区，协助地质勘探队进行登山勘探和复查。这是我国爬山运动和地质勘探工作合作的一个开端。
    这五名职工爬山运动员是：许竞、刘大义（运动健将）、刘连满（运动健将）、彭淑力、张俊岩。他们都是曾经征服过“冰山之父”——慕士塔格山或攀登过山中之王——贡嘎山的出色的爬山能手。
    镜铁山属祁连山系，在酒泉市西南。1955年，地质勘探人员在这一带找到了大片乌亮的镜铁矿石露头，因此被称为“镜铁山”。这里埋藏的铁矿石足够用来建设一个大型钢铁联合企业。
    镜铁山拔海约五千一百公尺，在五千公尺以上的顶区是终年积雪地带，积雪深度约三十公尺左右。山的平均坡度是三十度，最陡的地方约五十五度。地质部所属地质勘探队在普查阶段只能在拔海三千公尺地带活动。去年，地质勘探队虽曾组织年轻力壮的人员，背上最轻便的装备，多次企图攀登镜铁山顶峰，但终因缺乏爬山技术和经验而没有成功。中华全国总工会体育部得到地质部要求支援的消息后，随即决定派人前去协助。
    4月到7月是全年中镜铁山气候最好的季节。7月份以后，就经常有大风雪。因此爬山运动员们决定在4月里就配合地质勘探人员攀登镜铁山。
