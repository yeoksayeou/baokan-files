	Our people's history is a history of revolutions marked by repeated setbacks. The great thoughts and ideals of the heroes who once inspired the 1848-1849 War of Independence and the 1919 Proletarian Dictatorship were only realized for the first time in the past decade or so, under the People's Democratic system. April 4th, Hungarian Liberation Day, is the realization of the goals of previous Hungarian revolutionary movements. The Soviet armed forces brought liberation to our people, so our people regard this day each year as the starting point of their independence, freedom, and regime. The victory of our liberator, the Soviet army, gave us the opportunity to build socialism. This victory enabled us to unite with the people of the fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and advance side by side.

	Now, on the occasion of the thirteenth anniversary of the liberation, we can say that although we have made some mistakes, our achievements are great. Hungary's social relations have changed. The workers have become the masters of the factories, and the land has returned to the tillers. In all aspects of intellectual labor, magnificent prospects have unfolded before our intellectuals. Freedom and liberation have enabled our people to exert creativity in the political, economic, and cultural fields. Knowledge and culture are gradually entering every corner of the countryside, lighting the torch that illuminates the path forward.

	When we look back on the path we have traveled, our hearts are filled with sincere love for the fraternal people of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries. Whether in sunshine or storm, they have stood by our side. They gave us tremendous help when imperialism instigated counter-revolutionary riots, which is especially unforgettable for us. The great Chinese people were also the first to come to our aid. In our most difficult days, we received both political and economic support from the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. The "People's Daily" article "More on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" published at the end of 1956 and Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit to Hungary gave us great encouragement and strength in the days when the street fighting in Budapest had just stopped. The Chinese people's material assistance was also coordinated with political support, which enabled us not only to help people in the country who were suffering difficulties at the time, but also to stabilize our economy later on.

	To understand what freedom, independence, people's power, socialist construction, and the friendship of fraternal people mean to the Hungarian people, it is necessary to understand what kind of oppression Hungarian workers and peasants suffered under the Horthy regime, the first fascist state in the world, and how intellectuals were manipulated. That anti-people system not only forced communists underground, not only used all cruel means to kill them, but even the progressive freedom movement understood by the bourgeoisie was subjected to the strictest restrictions. Economic life was also partly controlled by Hungarian capitalists, but most of the important powers were controlled by capitalists from Germany, France, Italy, the United States, and Britain. The land belonged to the church and the nobility. The church alone owned 900,000 holds of land, while the rest of the land belonged to nobles, gentry, and landlords. The vast majority of peasants' children could not even attend elementary school, and the number of illiterates in rural areas was very large.

	The policy of the ruling class was to provoke the Hungarian people to hate the people of neighboring countries. The fascistized state once participated in the military occupation of Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and other countries, and followed Hitler, being the first to get involved in the war of aggression against the Soviet Union. When the Soviet army carried out heroic struggles and fought to the borders of Hungary, the people who had suffered the pain of war and the bankrupt country – like other countries – had the opportunity to break away from the war and stand on the side of the Soviet Union. However, the Hungarian ruling class rejected this opportunity and supported Hitler's fascism to the very end. April 4, 1945 – that historic day finally arrived: the Soviet army drove the last fascist troops out of our territory and liberated Hungary.

	With the victory of the Soviet army, the People's Democratic movement quickly unfolded in Hungary. According to the plan already drawn up by the Hungarian Communist Party, we implemented land reform, and 600,000 landless peasants replaced 10,000 landlords and became the new masters of the land. The Hungarian peasants' thousand-year dream of land and a better life was realized. Then, mines, banks, and factories with more than one hundred workers were nationalized. Land reform and nationalization consolidated the worker-peasant alliance and created favorable conditions for the economic foundation of the People's Democratic system. The Soviet Union liberated our country, promoted the birth of a new life, and constantly provided enormous political and economic assistance for our country's development and progress.

	Our people will never forget the help given by our liberators to the war-torn country. At that time, our country was facing starvation. When the Soviet army's battle to liberate Budapest came to a victorious end, 1.5 million people in that city alone could not even get bread and water. After liberation, the Soviet Union transported supplies to Hungary in thousands of train cars as quickly as possible, giving bread to the starving city, raw materials to the factories and mines, and enabling us to start life anew. Our hardworking working people did not fail the Soviet Union's assistance, and achieved great success in construction within three or four years. After the counter-revolutionary events of 1956, the Hungarian working people once again established a new life and once again achieved success in construction.

	In October 1956, when the counter-revolution was about to win, the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government requested military assistance from the Soviet Union in order to save the people's power. The national independence and all the revolutionary achievements brought to Hungary by the Soviet army's liberation were greatly threatened by this counter-revolutionary rebellion. But the sons of the Soviet people sacrificed their lives and shed blood for the second time for the independence and revolutionary achievements of our people. We learned lessons from the October events and organized our party, state, and social life into a consolidated and strong force. The counter-revolutionary armed rebellion not only produced negative results, but also had positive lessons. These lessons are helpful not only to the Hungarian people, but also to the international workers' movement. After arduous struggles, we reorganized the party. Now our People's Republic is stronger and more powerful than before the October events, our political life is normal, and the national economy is stable. The Hungarian working people are increasingly aware of the background of the October events and are uniting more closely around the party.

	Now, the Hungarian people are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate Liberation Day, our greatest national holiday. We celebrate this day while also commemorating the military significance of this day, because the liberation of the whole country thirteen years ago brought about great revolutionary changes and achievements in the social and economic aspects of our people. A new motherland – the motherland of the Hungarian working people – has emerged.

	On April 4th, we raise the memorial flag with deep respect at the graves of the Soviet soldiers, who sacrificed their lives for the progressive cause of our people, for our happiness and freedom.

    我们的自由和独立的来源
    匈牙利国务部部长  马罗山·久尔吉
    我国人民的历史是屡经挫折的革命的历史。那些曾经鼓舞1848—1849年的自由战争和1919年的无产阶级专政的英雄们的伟大思想和理想，只是在过去十来年中，在人民民主制度下才第一次实现了。4月4日匈牙利解放日是历次匈牙利革命运动目标的实现。苏联武装部队给我们人民带来了解放，因此我国人民把每年这一天看作自己的独立、自由和政权的起点。我们的解放者苏联军队的胜利，给了我们建设社会主义的机会。这次胜利使我们能够与以苏联为首的各兄弟国家的人民团结起来，并肩前进。
    现在正当解放十三周年之际，我们可以说，虽然我们犯了一些错误，但我们的成绩是伟大的。匈牙利的社会关系改变了。工人成了工厂的主人，土地回到了耕种者手中。在脑力劳动各方面，在我们的知识分子面前展开了宏伟的远景。自由和解放使我国人民能够在政治、经济和文化方面发挥创造力。知识和文化逐渐进入农村的每个角落，点燃了照耀着前进道路的火炬。
    当我们回顾自己所走过的道路时，我们的心里就充满了对于苏联、中国以及其他人民民主国家兄弟人民的衷心热爱。无论是在阳光照耀下或是暴风雨中，他们都站在我们这一边。他们在帝国主义挑起反革命暴乱的时候给了我们巨大的帮助，这尤其是使我们忘不了的。伟大的中国人民也首先来帮助我们。在我们最困难的日子里，我们从中国共产党和中国人民那里得到政治和经济两方面的支持。“人民日报”在1956年年底所发表的“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文和周恩来同志在匈牙利的访问，在布达佩斯街头战斗刚停下来的日子里，给了我们很大的鼓舞和力量。中国人民的物资援助还配合着政治上的支援，这使我们不仅在当时能帮助国内遭受困难的人，并且使我国后来在经济上也稳定下来。要知道自由、独立、人民政权、社会主义建设和兄弟人民的友谊对于匈牙利人民有什么意义，就必须了解在世界上第一个法西斯国家——霍尔蒂政权下，匈牙利工人和农民受过什么样的压迫，知识分子是怎样地受人摆布。那个反人民的制度不仅迫使共产党人转入地下，不仅用尽一切残酷的手段来杀害他们，而且连资产阶级所理解的进步自由运动都受到最严格的限制。经济生活也是部分地掌握在匈牙利资本家手中，大部分重要权柄都被德国、法国、意大利、美国和英国的资本家所控制。土地属于教会和贵族。仅教堂就拥有九十万霍尔德土地，其余的土地则属于贵族、绅士和地主等。农民子女的绝大部分甚至连小学也上不了，农村文盲数目很大。
    统治阶级的政策是挑拨匈牙利人民仇恨邻国人民。被法西斯化了的国家曾经参加对捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、南斯拉夫等国的军事占领，而且追随着希特勒，最先卷入反对苏联的侵略战争。到苏联军队进行了英雄斗争，打到匈牙利边疆的时候，饱尝战争痛苦的人民和破产的国家——像其他国家一样，才有可脱离战争，而站到苏联那一边去。但是，匈牙利统治阶级拒绝了这个机会，并且支持希特勒法西斯直到最后一刻。1945年4月4日——这个有历史意义的日子终于来到了：苏联军队把最后的法西斯部队从我国领土上驱逐出去，解放了匈牙利。
    随着苏军的胜利，匈牙利很快展开了人民民主运动。根据匈牙利共产党早已拟定的计划，我们实行了土地改革，六十万无地的农民代替了一万个地主而成为土地的新主人。匈牙利农民一千年来对土地、对更好的生活的梦想实现了。接着，矿山、银行和有一百个工人以上的工厂国有化了。土地改革和国有化巩固了工农联盟，给人民民主制度的经济基础创造了有利条件。苏联解放了我国，促成了新生活的诞生，而且为我国的发展和进步不断提供政治和经济方面的巨大援助。
    我国人民永远忘不了我们的解放者给予饱受战争创伤的国家的帮助。当时我国面临着饥饿。当苏联军队为解放布达佩斯而进行的战斗胜利结束的时候，仅这个城市就有一百五十万人连面包和水都吃不上了。解放以后，苏联尽快地以成千的车皮运送物资到匈牙利来，使饥饿的城市得到面包，使工厂矿山得到原料，使我们能够重新开始生活。我国勤劳的劳动人民没有辜负苏联的援助，三、四年内就在建设方面获得了很大的成就。在1956年反革命事件后，匈牙利劳动人民再一次建立了新生活，再次获得了建设的成就。
    在1956年10月，当反革命几乎获胜的时候，工农革命政府为了挽救人民政权，请求苏联给予军事援助。苏联军队的解放给匈牙利带来的民族独立和一切革命成就，在这次反革命叛乱中都受到很大的威胁。但是苏联人民的儿子为了我国人民的独立和革命成就，第二次牺牲了生命，流出了鲜血。我们从十月事件吸取了教训，把我们的党、国家和社会生活组织成为巩固的坚强的力量。反革命的武装暴乱不光是产生了消极的结果，而且也有积极的教训。这些教训不仅是对于匈牙利人民，而且对于国际工人运动也是有帮助的。经过艰苦的斗争，我们重新把党组织起来了。现在我们的人民共和国比十月事件前更加坚强有力，我们的政治生活是正常的，国民经济是稳定的。匈牙利劳动人民越来越清楚地认识到十月事件的背景，并且在党的周围团结得更紧密了。
    现在，匈牙利人民正热烈地准备庆祝解放日，这是我们最伟大的国庆日。我们庆祝这一天，同时也纪念这一天的军事意义，因为十三年前全国的解放给我国人民带来了社会、经济方面的伟大的革命变化和成就。新的祖国——匈牙利劳动人民的祖国出现了。
    在4月4日这一天，我们以深深的尊敬在苏军战士的墓前举起纪念的旗帜，他们为了我国人民的进步事业，为了我们的幸福和自由献出了自己的生命。
