    Xiaqiao Mine Successfully Experiments with "Overall Flume Shifting"
    Opening Up a New Path for Increased Coal Production
    Yangquan Tries Combined Manual and Machine Coal Mining, Improving Machine Utilization Rate and Saving Labor

    (Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd dispatch) The Jiawang Mining Bureau successfully tested overall flume shifting (a flume is a machine used to transport coal) on April 14th in the coal mining first district of the Xiaqiao Coal Mine. Shifting the flume only took fifteen minutes, increasing efficiency by sixteen to thirty-two times. This technological innovation allows the coal faces of various mines to implement multi-cycle operations, increasing raw coal production by one to three times without increasing equipment and potentially reducing personnel, opening up a new path for a large increase in coal production in existing mines.
    Currently, the coal faces of various mines under the Jiawang Mining Bureau implement a one-shift coal mining system, one cycle per day, meaning coal is mined once a day. If two cycles per day can be achieved, meaning coal is mined twice a day, production can be doubled. Based on the current production situation where extraction only takes three to four hours, the main difficulty in implementing two cycles a day is the length of time it takes to shift the flume. For the 30-type heavy flume in the coal mining first district, it takes eight hours to shift it once, and at the fastest, it takes four hours. After the successful trial of overall flume shifting, this work area successfully achieved the first double-cycle operation on the same day. The responsible comrade of the Jiawang Mining Bureau said that they have decided to immediately promote this new experience in an all-round way. In the future, after the workers are familiar with the new technical operation methods, they can further achieve three to four cycles of operation per day.
    The overall flume shifting was designed and created successfully by Ni Fudong, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Xiaqiao Coal Mine, and Gao Zhenxiao, Mechanical and Electrical Technician. They reformed the original dispersed and manual shifting operations into overall and machine shifting, completely eliminating the heavy physical labor of manually shifting the flume. The job of flume shifter can basically be eliminated, and each coal mining area can therefore save eight to fifteen workers.

    (Our newspaper, Yangquan, 22nd dispatch) A new coal mining method combining manual mining and combined coal mining machine mining has been successfully tested in the 52nd coal mining team of the No. 2 Mine of the Shanxi Yangquan Mining Bureau. The mining engineers here believe that this is a major technological reform in the coal industry, and can be adopted by all mines that use machines. It is of great significance for solving the problem of low utilization rate of coal mining machinery in China.
    When using a combined coal mining machine alone, one shift of workers specializes in clearing the road for the combined coal mining machine. After the combined coal mining machine cuts coal once, they clear the roadway once, without mining the coal seam themselves. Now, this clearing team, while clearing the roadway, carries out a round of drilling and blasting, advancing about 1.2 meters. The clearing team of the 52nd team started cooperating with the combined coal mining machine in late March. When this team used a combined coal mining machine alone, the average output per person per day was only four to five tons of coal; when using manual mining alone, the average output per person per day was five to six tons of coal, with the highest being seven tons. However, on the first day of combining manual and combined coal mining machine mining, the average output per person was more than nine tons of coal, and thereafter it was around ten tons per day, with the highest being nearly twelve tons.
    This new coal mining method also reduces the heavy labor of coal miners. Originally, in mine excavation, after coal miners drilled and blasted, the coal shovelers had to hold heavy iron shovels and continuously shovel coal for seven or eight hours, about twenty-six tons per person per shift, to shovel all the coal. After the 52nd team implemented the combination of manual and combined coal mining machine mining, they adopted the method of "blasting and loading coal," moving the coal flume from a place more than one meter away from the coal wall to the front of the coal wall, so that most of the coal blasted down fell directly into the coal flume for transportation. In this way, twenty-one coal shovelers were reduced.
    The combination of manual and combined coal mining machine also creates conditions for better use of machines. When using a combined coal mining machine alone, roof support and road clearing took sixteen hours after each cut, and the excavated coal wall, because it was left empty for too long, had high pressure and loose coal walls, and large pieces of coal often fell off when the machine was running. Therefore, it was necessary to constantly deal with falling coal during the mining process. Combining manual and combined coal mining machine mining, due to the addition of drilling and blasting, the coal wall is only left empty for eight hours, and the combined coal mining machine has already cut through it before the roof pressure comes.
    At present, the state-owned coal mine system in Shanxi Province is planning to promote this new method.

### 夏桥矿试验“整体移溜子”成功  开辟了增产煤炭的新道路  阳泉试用人工和机器结合采煤，提高了机械利用率节省了人工

    夏桥矿试验“整体移溜子”成功
    开辟了增产煤炭的新道路
    阳泉试用人工和机器结合采煤，提高了机械利用率节省了人工
    本报徐州22日电　贾汪矿务局14日在夏桥煤矿采煤一区试验整体移溜子（溜子即运煤用的机器）成功。移溜子只花十五分钟，提高效率十六倍到三十二倍。这项技术革新，可以使各矿的回采工作面都能够实行多循环作业，在不增加设备而且可以减少人员的情况下，提高原煤产量一倍到三倍，开辟了现有矿井大量增产煤炭的新道路。
    贾汪矿务局所属各矿的各个回采工作面，现在实行的是一班采煤制，一天一个循环，就是一天采一遍煤。如能做到一天两个循环，即一天采二遍煤，产量就能增加一倍。根据目前回采只要三小时到四小时的生产状况，实行一天两个循环的主要困难是移溜子的时间太长，采煤一区的30型重型溜子，移一次要八小时，最快也要四小时。试验整体移溜子成功后，这个工区在当天就胜利地实现了第一个双循环作业。贾汪矿务局的负责同志说，他们已决定立即全面推广这项新经验，将来工人熟悉了新的技术操作方式以后，还能进一步实现一日三个循环到四个循环的作业。
    整体移溜子是由夏桥煤矿副总工程师倪福东和机电技师高震霄设计创造成功的。他们把原来是分散移、手工移的作业，改革成为整体移、机器移，全部消灭了人力移溜子的沉重的体力劳动。移溜子工这个工种已可以基本上不要，每个回采工区因此可以节省八到十五个工人。
    本报阳泉22日电　人工开采和联合采煤机开采相结合的新采煤方法，已经在山西阳泉矿务局二矿五二采煤队试验成功。这里的采煤工程师们认为：这是煤炭工业的一项重大技术改革，凡是使用机器的矿井都可以采用。它对解决我国目前采煤机械利用率低的问题有着重要意义。
    在单用联合采煤机开采的时候，有一班工人专为联合采煤机清理道路，联合采煤机每割一次煤之后，他们就清理一次巷道，自己不开采煤层。现在，这个清道班在清理巷道的同时，进行一次打眼放炮，进尺一点二公尺左右。五二队清道班工人是从3月下旬开始和联合采煤机合作的。这个队在单用联合采煤机开采的时候，平均每人每天只采煤四吨至五吨；单用人工开采，平均每人每天采煤五吨到六吨，最高的七吨。而人工和联合采煤机相结合开采的第一天，平均每人采煤九吨多，以后每天在十吨左右，最高的近十二吨。
    这种新的采煤方法，还减轻了采煤工人的笨重劳动，原来矿井的开采，在采煤工人打眼放炮以后，攉煤工人要握着笨重的铁锹，连续攉煤七八个小时之久，每班每人攉二十六吨左右，才能把煤攉完。五二队在实行人工和联合采煤机相结合开采以后，采用了“爆破装煤”的办法，把煤溜子从距煤壁一公尺多远的地方，移到煤壁跟前，让爆破下来的煤，大部分直接落到煤溜子里运走。这样，减少了二十一个攉煤工人。
    人工和联合采煤机相结合，也为更好地使用机器创造了条件。在单用联合采煤机开采的时候，每割过一次煤，放顶和清道这两项工作要占用十六小时，开凿的煤壁由于空着的时间过长，压力大，煤壁松散，在机器开动的时候，常有大块的煤掉下来。因此，在开采过程中，要不断地处理落煤。人工和联合采煤机相结合开采，由于增加了一次打眼放炮，煤壁空着的时间仅有八小时，在顶板压力没有来之前，联合采煤机已经割过去了。
    目前，山西省国营煤矿系统都在筹划推广这一新的方法。
