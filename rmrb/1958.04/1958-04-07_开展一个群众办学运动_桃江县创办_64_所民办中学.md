Xinhua News Agency, Taojiang, 6th. The on-site conference on the great leap forward in cultural and educational undertakings in Hunan Province, held in Taojiang County, concluded on the 5th.

The representatives who attended the conference visited the newly established private primary and secondary schools in Taojiang County and found the quality to be very good. They analyzed the characteristics of the great leap forward in education in Taojiang County as: the secretary takes the lead, the whole party mobilizes, relies on the masses, and runs schools diligently and thriftily. This county has many mountains, little farmland, and a large population. Since liberation, the education sector has developed greatly. Last year, the proportion of school-age children enrolled in school reached 80%, but only 12% of primary school graduates entered middle school. This year, under the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the vast number of farmers have an even more urgent need to learn culture in order to meet the high tide of agricultural technology reform. The Taojiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China paid close attention to this situation and sent a working group to conduct investigations on aspects such as the burden of mass education funding and the source of teachers. The investigation materials showed that the newly established schools practice work-study programs, and the burden on the masses is not great. More than 580 middle school students and more than 200 cadres sent to the countryside who are engaged in production in the county can solve the difficulty of teacher shortage. The County Party Committee seized the favorable opportunity of more than 1,700 primary and secondary school teachers in the county, who had undergone rectification and were full of socialist enthusiasm, and from the county to the township, the Party Committee Secretary personally took action, unified planning, and comprehensively arranged. In late March, in conjunction with production, a mass movement for running schools was launched throughout the county, establishing 64 private middle schools with 84 classes, enrolling 3,885 students, enabling 86% of primary school graduates in the county to enter middle school, more than twice the number of students enrolled by the government in the past eight years at a cost of more than 180,000 yuan. In public primary schools, measures such as tapping potential and increasing enrollment were adopted to newly enroll more than 6,000 primary school students, enabling 95% of school-age children in the county to attend school. The County Party Committee recently sent five working groups to the countryside to inspect, and all private primary and secondary schools in the county have started classes and are basically on track.

The classrooms of the private middle schools are all converted from ancestral halls and vacant rooms in a simple and crude manner; the desks are the dining tables from the students' homes. Students study for half a day and engage in production for half a day. The teachers in private middle schools also practice half-work and half-teaching. The public also allocated 1,545 mu of paddy fields, 340 mu of mountain land, and 19 mu of barren hills to the private middle schools as work-study bases for teachers and students. Many representatives called home during the conference to revise their plans for developing education. Hengyang Prefecture also held a radio conference on the great leap forward in education, deciding to accelerate the elimination of illiteracy and vigorously develop primary and secondary school education.

    开展一个群众办学运动
    桃江县创办64所民办中学
    新华社桃江6日电　湖南省教育厅在桃江县召开的全省文教事业跃进现场会议已在5日结束。
    参加会议的代表参观了桃江县新设的民办中小学，认为质量很好。他们分析了桃江县教育事业跃进的特点是：书记挂帅，全党动手，依靠群众，勤俭办学。这个县山多、田少、人多。解放几年来教育事业有很大发展，去年全县学龄儿童入学的占80％，但高小毕业生升中学的只占12％。今年在工农业生产大跃进的新形势下，广大农民为了迎接农业技术改革高潮的到来，学文化的要求更加迫切。中共桃江县委密切注意了这个情况，便派出工作组作了有关群众教育经费负担、师资来源等方面的调查。调查材料说明，新办的学校实行勤工俭学，群众负担不大。全县在乡生产的五百八十多名中学生和二百多名下放干部，可以解决师资困难。县委抓住全县一千七百多名中小学教师通过整风，社会主义干劲十足的有利时机，从县到乡，由党委书记亲自动手，统一规划，全面安排，在3月下旬，结合生产在全县开展了一个群众办学运动，创办了民办中学六十四所，八十四个班，招收学生三千八百八十五名，使全县86％的高小毕业生升入中学，比过去八年政府花十八万多元招收的学生还多两倍多。在公立小学中，采取挖潜力、充实学额等办法，新招收六千多名小学生，使全县95％的学龄儿童入学。县委最近派出五个工作组下乡检查，全县民办中小学都已开学上课，基本上走上了轨道。
    民办中学的教室，全部是利用祠堂空房，因陋就简改成的；课桌是学生家里的饭桌。学生半天学习、半天生产。民办中学的教师也实行半工半教。公家还拨给民办中学稻田一千五百四十五亩、山地三百四十亩、荒山十九亩，作为师生勤工俭学园地。很多代表在会议过程中，都打电话回家，修订发展教育事业的规划。衡阳专区还召开了教育事业跃进广播大会，决定加速扫除文盲和大力发展中小学教育。
