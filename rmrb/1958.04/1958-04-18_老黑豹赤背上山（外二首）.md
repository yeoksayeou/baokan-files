    Old Black Panther, Bare-Backed, Ascends the Mountain (Plus Two Poems)
    Qiao Yu
    Song Ya Cliff is perilous, its terrain treacherous.
    Beneath the cliff face lies a steep slope.
    A hoe striking red flagstone, wears down half a foot in a day.
    The project is arduous, a test of your resolve.
    Some complain there's too little earth,
    Others grumble about the abundance of stone.
    Hero Old Black Panther grows anxious,
    Unbuttons his cotton coat and sheds it.
    Bare-backed, he charges forth,
    Followed by twenty-odd brave warriors.
    The hoe is like mountain-shearing scissors,
    The steel shovel like a swift knife cutting.
    Earth is turned, stones tumble, the mountain trembles,
    Sweatdrops fall like heavy rain.
    Clang, clang, all morning,
    Fish scale patches cover the mountainside. [Note]
    Iron hoes can be worn down,
    But people of steel fear no wear.

    [Note] Fish scale pits are an important part of the comprehensive treatment project in Shahe County.

    Flower-Mulan Class
    Today's Flower-Mulan
    Needs no clever disguise.
    A steel shovel in hand, a hoe on her shoulder,
    Conquering millennia-old wilderness.
    Zhao Qiao's [Note]
    Fifty-eight feet tall, though small,
    Her spirit is immense.
    Raising a large steel shovel,
    Like a fierce tiger emerging from the valley.
    Leading troops on a western expedition for hundreds of miles,
    Even high mountains fear her.

    [Note] Zhao Qiao's is the Party Branch Secretary of Laobali Village in Shahe County, a renowned model of diligence and thrift in Hebei Province. This time, she organized a greening army, with villages as companies, and Comrade Zhao Qiao's served as the company instructor.
