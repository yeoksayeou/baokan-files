Xinhua News Agency, April 25th:

    Scientific research institutions, universities, and factories and enterprises in Beijing are universally establishing various cooperative relationships.

    The Industrial Collaboration Office, established by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to adapt to the great leap forward in industrial production, has organized the technical forces of more than 30 higher engineering colleges, secondary technical schools, and technical schools. Combined with the schools' work-study programs and teaching tasks, they are helping more than 30 factories and mining enterprises solve production and technical problems. In addition, many factories and schools have also adopted the method of horizontal connection and direct linkage to develop cooperative relationships. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant often asks the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Tsinghua University, Peking University, and other institutions to help the factory solve some production technology difficulties.

    This cooperative relationship is prominently reflected in the help given by colleges and universities to factories in the production and processing of various products. Products such as boiler engines, water pumps, agricultural machinery, bicycles, sewing machines, radios, and small machine tools produced and processed by various schools under the arrangement of the Beijing Municipal Committee's Industrial Collaboration Office are valued at more than 40 million yuan. The output value of products produced and processed by factories and schools directly signing contracts is also about 60 million yuan.

    Cooperation in new product trials and technology is also very common. With the cooperation of professors in the tractor major of Tsinghua University, the First Automobile Parts Factory studied the advantages of the world's most advanced cars and successfully trial-produced the "Jinggangshan" brand car. When carrying out technological innovation, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant proposed measures for the automatic control of blast furnace split-mouth flow, but the factory itself could not design it. They found the Thermal Engineering Control Design Institute, which helped them with the design work. When the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory was trial-producing the automatic combine harvester, teachers and students from the Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization and the Beijing Machine Manufacturing School helped them survey and draw more than 500 drawings, overcoming the difficulty of the factory's insufficient technical strength.

    In the cooperation, various units adopted a variety of cooperative methods according to the specific situation and needs. When the Beijing Mining Institute cooperated with the Jingxi Coal Mine, it adopted three methods: First, the people were handed over to the mine and assigned to use by the mine; Secondly, contract for the exploration work area, organize their own exploration team for exploration; Third, when conducting geological surveys, contract for the task, regardless of the work area, hand in the drawings next summer vacation. The Beijing Mining Institute also decided to open training courses in its affiliated factory to help the General Machinery Factory train 80 apprentices.

    In the cooperation between scientific research institutions and colleges and factories, teaching and production, theory and practice have been closely combined. Professors at Tsinghua University reflected: This is a good way to overcome the current disconnection of education from reality, and it is a practical test for their teaching work.

    The widespread development of this cooperative relationship between scientific research institutions, universities, and industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing has raised some new issues in cooperative relationships, such as how to supply raw materials in a timely manner, and how to further closely integrate teaching plans and production organization. The relevant parties are studying solutions to these problems.

### 书本理论和生产实际相结合  北京科学研究机构、大专学校普遍和工厂协作

    书本理论和生产实际相结合
    北京科学研究机构、大专学校普遍和工厂协作
    新华社25日讯　北京的科学研究机构、大专学校和各工厂企业之间，正在普遍建立各种协作关系。
    中共北京市委为适应工业生产大跃进而成立的工业协作办公室，已经把三十多个高等工科院校、中等技术学校、技工学校的技术力量组织起来，结合各校的勤工俭学和教学任务，帮助三十多个厂矿企业解决生产和技术上的问题。另外，许多工厂和学校还采取了横线联系、直接挂钩的方法，发展协作关系。石景山钢铁厂经常请北京钢铁工业学院、清华大学、北京大学等院校帮助工厂解决一些生产技术上的困难。
    这种协作关系突出地表现在大专学校帮助工厂生产、加工各种产品方面。经北京市委工业协作办公室安排各校生产和加工的锅驼机、水泵、农业机械、自行车、缝纫机、收音机、小型机床等产品，产值在四千万元以上。各工厂和学校直接签订合同，生产和加工的产品，产值也在六千万元左右。
    试制新产品和技术方面的协作，也很普遍。第一汽车附件厂在清华大学拖拉机专业教授的协作下，研究了世界上最先进的小汽车的优点后，试制成功了“井冈山”牌小汽车。石景山钢铁厂在开展革新技术时，提出高炉分口流量自动控制的措施，但工厂自己不能设计。他们找到热工控制设计研究院，这个研究院就帮助他们进行设计工作。北京农业机械厂在试制自动康拜因收割机时，北京农业机械化学院和北京机器制造学校师生帮助他们测绘了五百多张图纸，克服了这个工厂技术力量不足的困难。
    在协作中，各单位根据具体情况和需要，采取了多种多样的协作方法。北京矿业学院在和京西煤矿协作时，采取了三种方式：第一，把人交给矿厂，由矿厂分配使用；其次，把勘探工区包下，自己组织勘探队进行勘探；第三、在进行地质测量时，把任务包下，不分工区，明年暑假交出图纸。北京矿业学院还决定在它的附属工厂里开设训练班，帮助通用机械厂培养八十名学徒工。
    科学研究机构和大专学校在和工厂的协作中，使教学和生产、理论和实践得到了密切的结合。清华大学的教授反映：这是克服当前教育工作脱离实际的好办法，对他们的教学工作是一个实际检验。
    北京的科学研究机关、高等学校和工矿企业的这种协作关系的广泛发展，已在协作关系上提出了一些新的问题，如原材料如何及时供应，教学计划和组织生产如何进一步密切结合等。这些问题有关方面正在研究解决。
