The People of North Africa are Fighting
Li Qiao

Some compare the three countries of North Africa to a bird: Algeria is the body, and Morocco and Tunisia are the two wings. For years, this bird has suffered humiliation and torment under the shackles of colonialism. Today, it is finally flying towards the road of independence.

A little over two years ago, the people of Tunisia and Morocco won the independence of their homelands through long and heroic struggles. But the body of the bird—Algeria—has not yet been freed; even on the wings, the chains of colonialism have not been completely removed. Therefore, in fact, the entire North Africa is still fighting for independence and complete independence.

Drive French Troops Out of Tunisia

The struggle of the Tunisian people has recently seen new developments. On February 8 this year, French planes bombed peaceful villages in Tunisia. This aroused strong indignation among the Tunisian people. Mass movements demanding the withdrawal of French troops and the recovery of the Bizerte naval port have surged across Tunisia.

After Tunisia's independence, France still stationed 22,000 troops in the country and controlled five airfields and the strategically important Bizerte naval port. France did this, on the one hand, to maintain its colonial interests in Tunisia through military control, and on the other hand, to use Tunisia as a military base for conducting the colonial war in Algeria.

For more than two years, French colonialists have continuously invaded Tunisian territory, murdered Tunisian residents, and attacked Tunisian border guards. The bombing of Sakiet Sidi Youssef was a continuation of this series of atrocities.

French colonialists want to intimidate the Tunisian people with bloody massacres. However, this only strengthened the Tunisian people's determination to demand complete independence.

After the Sakiet Sidi Youssef incident, the United States acted as a "peacemaker" to "mediate" between France and Tunisia. In reality, it wanted to contain the Tunisian people's struggle for complete independence and to defend national sovereignty, and to establish American colonial control in Tunisia. However, despite the various hypocritical tactics of the United States, the Tunisian people, with their long experience in struggle, will not be fooled. They have the determination and strength to overcome all blatant aggression and double-dealing conspiracies to achieve the complete independence of their homeland.

Imperialism Must Not Occupy
Moroccan Territory

The Moroccan people are continuing their unremitting struggle for the complete unification of their homeland. Because, at present, there are still 55,000 French troops stationed in Morocco, and there are American military bases; in addition, Spanish colonialists control Ifni and southern Morocco.

In November last year, patriotic fighters in Ifni, with the support of the Moroccan people, launched an armed uprising against Spanish colonial rule. By December, the struggle had expanded to Saguia el-Hamra in Spanish Southern Morocco. In January of this year, the people of Spanish Sahara also rose up to fight.

The Spanish colonial army carried out bloody suppression of the insurgent people. It also received direct support from the two imperialist countries, France and the United States. Many of the planes used by the Spanish colonial army to bomb the people of Ifni were supplied by the United States.

However, the joint suppression by imperialist forces can only arouse the Moroccan people's more determined will to struggle. The Moroccan people's call to oppose the stationing of French troops and the establishment of American military bases on their homeland is growing louder and louder. The Istiqlal Party, the ruling party of Morocco, recently issued a communique firmly demanding that the government announce the abolition of all treaties allowing foreign troops to be stationed in Morocco, which reflects the strong anti-imperialist sentiment of the Moroccan people.

The Algerian People are Moving Towards Victory

The Algerian people are constantly achieving victories in their struggle against French colonial suppression.

Since the Algerian people launched an armed uprising on November 1, 1954, the war has continued for three and a half years. Currently, France has 800,000 soldiers, police, and gendarmes, and 200,000 militiamen composed of European residents in Algeria. These colonial armed forces are carrying out frenzied massacres against the Algerian people. However, the Algerian people are becoming stronger as they fight. The Algerian National Liberation Army, which started with only 3,000 guerrillas, has now developed into a 100,000-strong army equipped with modern light weapons. With the support of the people, it constantly inflicts heavy blows on the French colonial army.

The war in Algeria started in the north and east. Later, the combat areas gradually expanded. By March 1957, the area north of the Algerian Sahara, from the Tunisian border in the east to the Moroccan border in the west, and from the Mediterranean coast in the north, had formed a continuous operational area. In the past year, the fighting has been more intense than in the past and has expanded to the Sahara region.

The just struggle of the Algerian people has received widespread sympathy and support throughout the world. On March 30 this year, people from Asian and African countries held activities for "Algeria Day" according to the decision of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference. This formed a huge anti-colonialist demonstration. At the recent World Peace Council and the just-concluded Conference of Independent African States, France's colonial policy in Algeria was also severely condemned.

Three and a half years of facts have proved that the Algerian people's steps towards independence cannot be stopped by any force. If the French colonialists continue to act recklessly, they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous defeats.

    北非人民在战斗中
    李樵
    有人把北非三国比作一只鸟儿，阿尔及利亚是鸟的身子，摩洛哥和突尼斯是左右两翼。多少年来，这只鸟儿在殖民主义锁链的捆绑下受着屈辱和折磨。今天它终于向着独立的道路飞翔了。
    两年多以前，突尼斯和摩洛哥人民用长期的英勇斗争赢得了自己祖国的独立。但是鸟的身子——阿尔及利亚——还没有得到自由；即使在两翼上，殖民主义的锁链也并没有完全解除掉。因此，事实上，整个北非都仍然在为争取独立和完全独立而斗争。
  把法国军队赶出突尼斯去
    突尼斯人民的斗争最近有了新的发展。今年2月8日，法国飞机轰炸了突尼斯的和平村庄。这引起了突尼斯人民的强烈愤慨。要求法国军队撤走和要求收回比塞大海港的群众运动，在突尼斯全国汹涌澎湃地展开了。
    突尼斯独立以后，法国在这个国家还驻有两万二千名军队，并且控制着五处飞机场和具有重要战略意义的比塞大海港。法国这样做，一方面是企图通过军事控制来维护在突尼斯的殖民利益，另一方面是为了把突尼斯当作进行阿尔及利亚殖民战争的一个军事基地。
    两年多来，法国殖民主义者不断侵扰突尼斯领土，杀害突尼斯居民，并且袭击突尼斯边防军。轰炸萨基埃特的事件，就是这一系列暴行的继续。
    法国殖民主义者想用血腥的屠杀吓倒突尼斯人民。但是，这只是使突尼斯人民要求完全独立的意志更加坚定了。
    在萨基埃特事件发生以后，美国就以“和事佬”身份在法国和突尼斯之间进行“斡旋”。实际上，它是想遏止突尼斯人民争取完全独立和保卫国家主权的斗争，并且在突尼斯建立美国的殖民控制。但是，尽管美国耍弄各种伪善手法，有着长期斗争经验的突尼斯人民是不会上当的。他们有决心和力量战胜一切明目张胆的侵略和两面三刀的阴谋，来取得祖国的完全独立。
    不能让帝国主义占领
      摩洛哥的领土
    摩洛哥人民正在为争取祖国的完全统一而继续进行着不懈的斗争。因为，目前在摩洛哥境内，还驻扎有五万五千名法国军队，还设有美国的军事基地；此外，西班牙殖民者控制着伊夫尼和摩洛哥南部地区。
    去年11月，伊夫尼的爱国战士在摩洛哥人民支持下掀起了反对西班牙殖民统治的武装起义。到12月，斗争就扩大到西属南摩洛哥的塞吉埃特—埃尔—哈姆拉。今年1月，西属撒哈拉的人民也起来进行了战斗。
    西班牙殖民军队对起义的人民进行了血腥的镇压。它还得到了法国和美国这两个帝国主义国家的直接支持。西班牙殖民军队用来轰炸伊夫尼人民的飞机，就有不少是美国供给的。
    但是，帝国主义势力的共同镇压只能激起摩洛哥人民更坚决的斗争意志。摩洛哥人民反对在他们祖国的领土上驻扎法国军队和设立美国军事基地的呼声是越来越响亮了。摩洛哥执政党独立党最近发表公报坚决要求政府宣布废除一切外国军队驻扎在摩洛哥的条约，就反映了摩洛哥人民的强烈反帝情绪。阿尔及利亚人民正在走向胜利
    阿尔及利亚人民在反对法国殖民镇压的斗争中，正在不断取得胜利。
    从1954年11月1日阿尔及利亚人民发动武装起义以来，战争已经继续了三年半。目前，法国在阿尔及利亚有八十万士兵、警察和宪兵，二十万由欧洲籍居民组成的民兵。这些殖民武装对阿尔及利亚人民进行疯狂的屠杀。但是，阿尔及利亚人民却愈战愈强。阿尔及利亚民族解放军开始时只是三千名游击队员，现在已经发展为拥有现代化轻武器的十万精兵。它在人民的支持下，不断地给法国殖民军队以沉重的打击。
    阿尔及利亚的战争首先是从北部、东部开始的。以后战斗地区逐渐扩大。到1957年3月，阿尔及利亚撒哈拉以北的地区，东至突尼斯边境，西至摩洛哥边界，北至地中海海岸，形成了连成一片的作战地区。近一年来，战斗比过去更为紧张，并且已经扩及撒哈拉地区。
    阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争，在全世界得到了广泛的同情和支持。今年3月30日，亚非各国人民根据亚非人民团结会议的决定，举行了“声援阿尔及利亚日”的活动。这形成了一场规模巨大的反殖民主义的大示威。在不久前举行的世界和平理事会上和刚刚举行的非洲独立国家会议上，法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民主义政策也受到了严正的谴责。
    三年半的事实证明，阿尔及利亚人民走向独立的脚步是任何力量所阻挡不住的。法国殖民主义者如果继续蛮干到底，必将遭到更加惨重的失败。（附图片）
