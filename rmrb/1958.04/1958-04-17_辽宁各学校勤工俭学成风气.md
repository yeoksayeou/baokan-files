Liaoning Daily reports: Schools at all levels in Liaoning Province are vigorously implementing the policy of combining education with production, and are widely carrying out work-study programs. Many schools have begun to form a new atmosphere of studying and working at the same time.

At present, work-study activities have been widely carried out in all universities, middle schools, and primary schools in the province. Most engineering colleges and secondary schools have already begun production using their practice factories and laboratories. For example, the first batch of more than 210 students from the Shenyang Mechanical Manufacturing Industrial School are processing spare parts for external clients in various workshops of the practice factory, and are trial-producing diesel engines and water pumps to support agricultural production. The ninety students in the lathe workshop are producing radiator plugs, constantly exceeding quotas, with an average quality of 98%. The Shenyang Building Materials School has successfully trial-produced No. 50 cement using coal slag picked up by students. After class every day, some students from the Shenyang Mechanical Industry School go to the practice factory to process parts for machines such as water pumps, and also trial-produce locomotive boilers. Agricultural schools and some primary and secondary schools with practice gardens are actively accumulating fertilizer and preparing for plowing. Some professors and students from the Shenyang Agricultural College are collecting manure together. Kaiyuan Middle School launched a fertilizer accumulation competition, and twelve "ten-thousand-jin classes" appeared in just five days. Many primary and secondary schools are using their spare time to participate in labor in agricultural cooperatives. Since the beginning of school, more than 68,000 teachers and students in Xinmin County's primary and secondary schools have completed a total of 250,000 workdays, mainly accumulating fertilizer, participating in water conservancy construction, and delivering fertilizer to agricultural cooperatives.

    辽宁各学校勤工俭学成风气
    本报讯　据辽宁日报报道：辽宁省大中小学大力贯彻执行教育与生产相结合的方针，普遍开展勤工俭学活动。许多学校已经开始形成一面读书，一面劳动的新风气。
    目前全省各大中小学的勤工俭学活动已经普遍开展起来。工科高等和中等学校大都已经利用实习工厂和实验室进行生产。如沈阳机械制造工业学校第一批参加生产的二百一十多名学生，正在实习工厂各个车间对外加工零活，试制支援农业生产的柴油机和水泵，车工车间的九十名学生生产暖气包丝堵，不断突破定额，质量平均达到98％。沈阳建筑材料学校利用学生拣的煤渣试制五十号水泥，已经成功。沈阳机械工业学校每天下课以后，都有一部分学生到实习工厂加工水泵等机器的零件，同时还试制锅驼机。农科学校和一些有实习园地的中小学，正在积肥备耕。沈阳农学院有的教授和学生一道掏大粪。开原中学展开了积肥竞赛，仅五天工夫就出现十二个万斤班。很多中小学都利用课余时间到农业社参加劳动。新民县中小学六万八千多名师生，从开学到现在，共做了二十五万个劳动日，主要是给农业社积肥、参加水利建设、送粪等。
