    Introduction to Several Wild Plants

    Chinese Pistache Seeds
    Chinese pistache seeds, also known as Huang Lin seeds or Huang Dongzi, are the fruits of the Chinese pistache tree and can be used to extract oil. According to the analysis and identification by the Shanghai Institute of Oils and Fats Science, the oil content is 35.5%, which is a non-drying oil that can be used to make soap, for lighting, and for cart lubrication. Some farmers in certain areas also use it for consumption.

    The oil cake after oil extraction is a good feed and can also be used as fertilizer.

    The Chinese pistache tree belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and grows in Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and southern provinces.

    Unlike other wild oilseeds, Chinese pistache seeds contain the most oil when they are green; red or yellowish ones contain no oil, and purple ones contain little oil. Pay attention to this when picking them to avoid affecting the oil yield.

    The method of extracting oil from Chinese pistache seeds is roughly the same as that for sesame and flax seeds. The difference is that the finely ground Chinese pistache seeds are too sticky, so some coarse bran needs to be added before steaming to increase the oil yield. Farmers in Lin County, Henan Province, use this method and can extract an average of 23 jin of oil from every 100 jin of Chinese pistache seeds.

    Dioscorea cirrhosa
    Dioscorea cirrhosa, also known as Ci Liang, Ru Lang, Shu Lang, or Xue Jiang Tou, is a perennial wild vine with tuberous roots, produced in Central South, Southwest China, and other places. A few areas also cultivate it artificially (Gaoyao Special District, Guangdong Province). Dioscorea cirrhosa can be harvested after growing for more than three years and can be harvested continuously for four or five years.

    Dioscorea cirrhosa contains tannin and is a good raw material for tanning adhesives. Dioscorea cirrhosa tanning adhesives can be used to tan leather. Dioscorea cirrhosa is also an excellent non-fading dye. China's famous Xiangyun yarn is dyed with Dioscorea cirrhosa, and its color is bright, light-resistant, water-resistant, acid-resistant, alkali-resistant, and moisture-resistant, and it remains unchanged for a long time. The waste residue after extracting tanning adhesives or using it as a dye contains rich starch and can also be used as a raw material for brewing.

    Dioscorea cirrhosa can be harvested all year round, with the best quality harvested from May to August. When collecting, only cut off the larger Dioscorea cirrhosa (each weighing more than four liang), then pile the soil on top to allow the small Dioscorea cirrhosa to continue to grow for harvesting the following year. Dioscorea cirrhosa has a high water content and is very prone to mold and deterioration. In storage, it should be piled in a dry, cool, and ventilated place, and can be packaged in bamboo baskets or straw mats.

    Cork
    Cork is the outer bark of the cork oak tree. Cork oaks are widely distributed, and there are forests of cork oaks in the Qinling Mountains, the Funiu Mountains in Henan, the Dabie Mountains in Anhui and the mountainous areas of southern Anhui, and the Yimeng Mountains in Shandong.

    Cork is light, soft, and elastic, and has the properties of not conducting heat, not conducting electricity, being impermeable to water, being impermeable to air, being resistant to friction, sound insulation, shock resistance, and acid resistance. Cork can be processed and manufactured by cork factories to make lifebuoys, cork bricks, sound insulation boards, bottle stoppers, cork paper, etc. Cork products are indispensable materials for national defense industry and light and heavy industry.

    In the past, the raw materials for cork products in our country have always relied on imports, and the utilization of this domestic resource only began after liberation. Each ton of cork is worth about 400 yuan.

    Litsea cubeba (May Chang)
    Litsea cubeba is a wild plant with great economic value. Exporting 20 kilograms of Litsea cubeba oil (fragrant oil distilled from Litsea cubeba) can be exchanged for one ton of gasoline. After Litsea cubeba is refined into volatile oil, it can also be squeezed to extract oil, with an oil yield of about 15%-20%. Litsea cubeba also has certain uses in medicine.

    Litsea cubeba is also called Bi Chengqie, wild pepper, or Xiang Gui. Litsea cubeba is a creeping plant, flowers in spring and fruits in summer, belonging to the pepper family. It originated in India, Java, and other places, and is found in various provinces in southern China. The output of this thing is very high. Anhui Province produces 200,000 to 300,000 jin every year. According to preliminary estimates, the total annual output in the southern region is about 10,000 tons.

    Blackseed
    Blackseed is the fruit of a wild plant, and many southern provinces produce it. It is estimated that Jiangxi Province alone produces 2,000 tons per year. Blackseed contains about 37% oil, with an oil yield of 20%-25%. The oil is coffee-colored and is a non-drying oil that can be used to make soap or as a lubricating oil. The method of extracting blackseed oil is simple: crush the dried blackseed and steam the billet to extract the oil.

    Mature blackseed is a black bean-shaped round grain with blue pulp on the outer skin.

    Ailanthus altissima Seeds
    Ailanthus altissima seeds are also a relatively large wild oilseed. According to preliminary estimates from the four provinces of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi, the annual output is about 5,000 tons. The kernel of Ailanthus altissima seeds accounts for more than half of the seed, and the kernel contains 30%-36% oil, with an oil yield of 20%-26%. The oil extracted from Ailanthus altissima seeds is brownish-green and is a drying oil that can be used to make soap or mixed into other drying oils.

    Ailanthus altissima seeds are the seeds of the Ailanthus altissima tree. The Ailanthus altissima tree is a deciduous tree with male and female plants, winged fruits, and kernels in the fruits. This tree is highly adaptable and is distributed in North China, East China, Northwest China, and Northeast China. Ailanthus altissima is artificially planted and also grows wild in the mountains.

    Apocynum venetum
    Apocynum venetum is a wild high-grade textile fiber plant. The fiber quality of Apocynum venetum in my country is better than that of cotton, flax, and ramie, and the fineness and tensile strength are similar to wool.

    This wild plant is widely distributed in our country. This hemp grows north of the Yangtze River, the Huai River basin, the Qinling Mountains, the Bayan Har Mountains and north of the Kunlun Mountains, as well as in Altai, Inner Mongolia, Chengde, Dalian and other places. Among them, the Qaidam Basin and the Tarim Basin grow the most abundantly. In the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, the lower reaches of the Ejin River in western Inner Mongolia, and the wastelands on the coast of Shandong and Hebei, there are large areas of Apocynum venetum that cannot be seen to the end. It is estimated that the annual production of raw hemp in these areas is at least 1.5 million dan.

    Apocynum venetum is called tea stalks, Hema seedlings, and red hair seedlings in Shandong; tea flower in Hebei and Shanxi; wild leaf tea in northern Jiangsu; wild hemp in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, Hexi, Gansu, and Xinjiang; and Zha Ha in Qinghai. Apocynum venetum was named by Dong Zhengjun of the Chinese Academy of Sciences after the Lop Nur Plain (in the Tarim Basin).

    介绍几种野生植物
    黄连籽
    黄连籽又叫黄林籽、黄栋子，是黄连木树的果实，可以榨油。据上海油脂科学研究所的分析鉴定，含油量35.5％，是一种不干性油，可以制肥皂、点灯、捁车，部分地区农民还拿它食用。
    榨油后的油饼，是一种良好的饲料，也可以作为肥料用。
    黄连木属于漆树科，在山东、河北、河南和南方各省生长。
    黄连籽与其他野生油料不同，只有绿色的才含油最多，红色的或带黄色的都不含油，紫色的含油也少。采摘的时候必须注意这一点，以免影响出油率。
    黄连籽榨油的方法，与芝麻、胡麻榨油的方法大致相同，不同的地方是，黄连籽碾细后粘性太重，所以在上笼蒸之前需要加一些粗糠，这样可以增加出油量。河南省林县农民用这种方法，平均每一百斤黄连籽可以出油二十三斤。
    薯　莨
    薯莨又叫茨莨、茹榔、薯榔、血酱头，是一种多年生野生藤本植物的块根，产于中南、西南等地，个别地区亦有人工培植的（广东省高要专区）。薯莨生长三年以上即可挖采，以后可连续挖采四、五年。
    薯莨含单宁，是良好的烤胶原料，薯莨烤胶可以鞣制皮革。薯莨也是优良不脱色的染料，我国驰名的香云纱就是用薯莨染制的，其颜色鲜艳、耐光、耐水、耐酸、耐碱、耐潮湿，经久不变；浸提烤胶或作染料后的废渣，含有丰富淀粉，还可做酿酒原料。
    薯莨一年四季都可挖采，以5至8月份挖采的质量较好。采集的时候，只切取较大的薯莨（每个四两以上的），然后再将土堆上，让小薯莨继续成长，以待第二年掘取。薯莨含水量大，极易霉烂变质，在保管上应堆置在干燥、阴凉、通风的地方，可用竹篓或席包包装。　
                              （杨应龙）
    栓皮
    栓皮是栓皮栎树干的外皮。栓皮栎分布很广，秦岭、河南伏牛山、安徽大别山和皖南山区、山东沂蒙山区等都有成林的栓皮栎。
    栓皮体质轻软、富有弹性，并具不传热、不导电、不透水、不透气、耐磨擦、隔音、防震、抗酸等性能。栓皮经过软木工厂加工制造，可以作救生圈、软木砖、隔音板、瓶塞、软木纸等。栓皮所制成的软木产品，是国防工业、轻重工业不可缺少的材料。
    我国过去软木制品原料一向依赖进口，利用国内这项资源，自解放后才开始。每吨栓皮约值四百元。山苍子（荜澄茄）
    山苍子是一种经济价值很大的野生植物。出口山苍子油（用山苍子蒸馏出来的香料油）二十公斤就可以换回一吨汽油。山苍子在提炼出挥发油以后还可以榨出油脂，出油率约15％—20％。山苍子在医药上也有一定用途。
    山苍子又叫荜澄茄、山胡椒、香桂等。山苍子是一种蔓生植物，春花夏实，属胡椒科，原产印度、爪哇等地，我国南方各省都有。这种东西的产量很高，安徽省每年产二到三十万斤。据初步估计，南方地区每年总产约一万吨。
    乌籽
    乌籽是一种野生植物的果实，南方一些省多有出产。据估计，只江西一省每年就产二千吨。乌籽含油量37％左右，出油率20％—25％，油咖啡色，属不干性油，可用作制肥皂，也可作润滑油用。榨乌籽油的方法简单，把干乌籽碾碎蒸坯就能榨出油来。
    成熟的乌籽是黑色豆形圆粒，外皮有蓝色浆液。
    椿树籽
    椿树籽也是一种比较大宗的野生油料。据河南、河北、山东、山西四省的初步估计，年产量约五千吨。椿树籽的籽仁占椿树籽的一半以上，籽仁含油量30％—36％，出油率20％—26％。椿树籽榨制的油是棕绿色，属干性油，可制肥皂或掺入别的干性油里用。
    椿树籽是臭椿树的子实。臭椿树是一种落叶乔木，雌雄异株，果实有翅，果中有仁。这种树适应性较强，分布在华北、华东、西北和东北等地区。臭椿有人工种植的，也有在山野里自生的。罗　布　麻
    罗布麻是一种野生高级纺织纤维植物。我国罗布麻的纤维品质比棉花、亚麻、苎麻都好，细度、拉力和羊毛差不多。
    这种野生植物在我国分布很广。长江下游以北、淮河流域、秦岭、巴颜喀啦山和昆仑山以北各地，以及阿尔泰、内蒙古、承德、大连等地都有这种麻生长。其中以柴达木盆地、塔里木盆地生长最多最盛。在甘肃河西走廊，内蒙古西部额齐纳河下游和山东、河北滨海的荒地上，都有一望不到头的大片罗布麻。据估计，这些地区每年生产的原麻最少有一百五十万担。
    罗布麻在山东叫茶棵子、河马秧子、红毛子棵；在河北、山西叫茶叶花；在江苏北部叫野叶茶；在陕西关中、甘肃河西和新疆叫野麻；在青海叫札哈。罗布麻是中国科学院董正均以罗布平原（在塔里木盆地）命名的。
