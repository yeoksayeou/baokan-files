Another Letter to Young Readers
    Bing Xin

    Dear Children,

    On March 8th, I went to the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir construction site and participated in a few hours of labor, which filled me with indescribable excitement and joy.

    The Thirteen Tombs are located in the northeast of Changping County in the suburbs of Beijing. They are the burial sites of thirteen emperors after the Ming Dynasty moved its capital to the north. The Wenyu River flows through the south, and it is surrounded by mountains on three sides, making for beautiful scenery. However, every summer during the rainy season, mountain torrents rush down along the mountain valleys, with the force of a raging tide, often submerging the houses and fields along the banks of the Wenyu River. The former ruling dynasties only cared about building tall tombs and sacrificial halls for themselves on the mountainside, and only planted lush trees around these tombs and sacrificial halls. They were indifferent to the suffering of the people below the mountains, who were plagued by floods!

    Now that the people are their own masters, everything has changed! With the government's subsidies and the support of the masses, the people of Changping began to build the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir themselves on January 21st of this year. They plan to build a dam at the exit of the mountain ring – Dongshankou – to store the mountain torrents in a lake that is more than seven zhang deep. The area of this lake is equivalent to three times the size of Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace. To the west of the dam, a hydroelectric power station will also be built, which can generate electricity using hydropower during the irrigation season each year. In the future, there will be: thousands of acres of fertile land, shady green trees, ducks swimming on the water, fish leaping in the water, and children can come here in groups to camp, climb mountains, and sightsee. What a happy and beautiful life this will be!

    This reservoir must be completed before the rainy season in June. Therefore, tens of thousands of people are sweating and working hard day and night on this construction site, racing against the floods, and the flow of people has already surpassed the river! I am only doing a little light labor here, but looking ahead and looking back, on the mountainsides on three sides and on the boundless sandy ground, there are groups of people busily pushing carts and carrying earth, and small red flags are fluttering in the gentle breeze in the distance! Thinking that in three months, this place will be the center of the lake, and that I can contribute my own meager share in this vigorous labor, makes me feel both ashamed and joyful. I will be leaving the motherland temporarily for about two or three months. By the time I return, this place will be a scene of lake and light. I heard that the children will also be going to the lakeside to plant trees soon. I think the trees you plant will already have lush green leaves by then. Collective labor creates such a beautiful and happy world!

    These past two days, the wind has been gentle and the clouds thin. This kind of weather for brewing flowers is called "chun yin" in Chinese and "hana-gumo" in Japanese. Once hana-gumo passes, cherry blossoms will bloom everywhere in Japan. Here, as soon as the sunshine emerges, willow leaves will unfurl their green, and apricot blossoms will bloom in full splendor! Spring overcast weather always fills me with an indescribable joy of anticipation, like sitting in front of a stage, the moment the lights go out, we are full of joy waiting, waiting for the curtain to open and a mythical, colorful, and glorious fairyland to appear on the stage... Do you feel this way too?

    By the time you see this letter, I will already be in sunny Italy. If I have time during the trip, I will definitely write to you again. I wish
    You a happy spring!
                    Your friend, Bing Xin
                        March 20, 1958 Night, Beijing

    亲爱的小朋友：
    3月8日那一天，我到十三陵水库工地上，参加了几小时的劳动，觉得有说不尽的兴奋和愉快。
    十三陵在京郊昌平县的东北边，是明朝京都北迁以后的十三代帝王的陵墓所在，南面有温榆河穿过，三面是山，风景优美。但是每到夏雨时节，山洪就顺着这个大山环里的几条山沟，奔腾下泻，势如巨涛，温榆河两岸的人家田地，常常被大水所淹没。从前的统治王朝，只顾给自己在半山坳里，盖起高大的陵墓祭殿，也只在这些陵墓祭殿的四围，种起茏葱的树木，对于山下人家，蒙受水患的疾苦，是漠不关心的！
    人民做了自己的主人，一切都变了！昌平人民在政府的补助下，群众的支援下，从今年1月21日开始，自己动手来修建十三陵水库。他们计划在大山环的出口——东山口，修起一道拦河坝，把山洪蓄在七丈多深的水湖里，这水湖的面积，相当于颐和园昆明湖的三倍。在大坝的西边，还要盖一座水力发电站，在每年灌溉的时期，可以用水力发电。将来这里是：良田千顷，绿树成荫，水面鸭游，水中鱼跃，小朋友们还可以成群结队地到这里来露营，爬山，游览；这生活该是何等的快乐美好！
    这座水库必须在6月雨季以前完工，因此，这工地上，每天每夜都有几万人在流汗苦干，和洪水赛跑，而且人流已经赶在河流的前头！我在这里，只做一点轻微的劳动，但是往前望，往后看，三面山腰和一望无际的沙地上，都有一群一群的人们，在紧张地推车挑土，远远地一面一面小小的红旗，在和风中飘扬！想到三个月后，这里将是水湖的中心，在这万马奔腾的劳动干劲里，我也能尽到我自己微薄的一分，使我惭愧而又喜悦。我要暂时离开祖国，为期大概两三个月，等到我归来时节，这里已是一片湖光了。听说小朋友们最近也要到湖边去种树，我想那时你们种的树木，也已经绿叶扶疏了，集体的劳动，创造出多么美丽快乐的一个世界呵！
    这两天来，风柔云薄，这种酿花天气，中国话叫做“春阴”，日本话叫做“花昙”。花昙一过，日本各处就开遍了樱花。我们这里也是一漾出晴光，就是柳叶舒青，杏花怒放了！春阴的天气，总使我有说不出的期待的欢乐，如同坐在舞台前面，电灯熄灭的一刹那顷，我们满怀快乐地在等待，等待这帘幕一开，台上现出神话般五彩辉煌的仙境……你们也有这种的感觉吗？
    你们看到这封信的时候，我已在风光明媚的意大利了，旅途中如有工夫，一定再给你们写信。祝
    你们春天快乐！
                    你的朋友　冰　心
                        1958，3，20夜　北京
