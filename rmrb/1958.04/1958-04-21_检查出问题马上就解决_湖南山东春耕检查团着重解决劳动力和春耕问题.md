Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th – The Hunan and Shandong Spring Planting Inspection Teams are focusing on solving labor and spring planting problems.

    Hunan Province's Spring Planting Production Inspection Team has completed its comprehensive inspection of spring plowing preparations throughout the province. According to recent reports from various localities, this inspection has been very effective, clarifying the current situation in rural work, promptly identifying several major problems, and prompting various localities to make more solid preparations for spring plowing.

    The important problems discovered and being addressed by the inspection team include the following three:

    (1) With the development of the great leap forward in production, the problem of labor shortage in rural Hunan is becoming increasingly acute. According to inspections, many counties in Hunan have a labor deficit of about 30%, and some places even reach over 40%. In recent months, the phenomenon of day and night processing and rush work has been quite common in rural areas. In this situation, a few people have developed a shrinking mentality and have doubts about the great leap forward in production; most people have adopted the method of increasing labor intensity to ease the contradiction. Although this spirit is good, it cannot last. Some people have also taken the approach of boldly mobilizing the masses, actively leading the masses, and using improved tools, improved operating techniques, and improved labor management methods to solve this difficulty, and have achieved great results. After studying the above situation and problems, the Provincial Party Committee requested that all localities boldly mobilize the masses, overcome conservative ideas, add ingenuity to their drive, carry out technological reforms in a fast, good, and economical manner, solve the problem of labor shortage, and promote spring plowing production. Under the vigorous leadership of local Party committees, the tool reform movement is rapidly and deeply developing throughout the province. As of now, according to a survey of 47 counties including Xiangtan and Changde, more than 16,000 kinds of tools have been created and improved, and are widely promoted in various townships. The tense situation of labor shortage in these areas has been considerably eased.

    (2) Focusing on grain production as the main task, further develop diversified operations and overcome the single-line approach. Inspections revealed that many places, due to concentrating their efforts on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation in the previous stage, neglected to develop diversified operations, which has brought a certain degree of tension to the current rural economic life. According to a survey, in 1957, in the total output value of agricultural and sideline industries in Hunan Province, the income from diversified operations other than food crops and soybeans accounted for 53%, and in some places even reached over 60%. According to the needs of national construction and agricultural development, the output value of diversified operations should increase year by year. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that the central key to solving this problem is to solve the difficulty of labor shortage. Therefore, it requires all localities to immediately take measures, boldly mobilize the masses, improve production and transportation tools, improve production management, improve labor efficiency, and rationally arrange labor, and strive to overcome difficulties. At the same time, it also pointed out that the most practical guarantee for carrying out diversified operations is that agricultural cooperatives across the province should organize hundreds of thousands of specialized teams for diversified operations. These specialized teams are uniformly allocated by the cooperative during busy farming seasons to support grain production; during slack farming seasons, the specialized teams serve as the backbone, and the cooperative allocates labor to support specialized production. In this way, grain production and diversified operations can support each other and develop comprehensively.

    (3) Resolved the tension in food rations and money that had emerged in some areas. This year, the grain consumption situation of farmers throughout the province is good. 80% of households have achieved grain consumption according to plan (of which 15%-30% of households have surpluses), and about 20% of households have exceeded the quota due to some reasons. The phenomenon of grain shortages is more prominent in areas affected by disasters last year and areas producing more miscellaneous grains. The main reason is that labor has been very tight since last winter, and strong laborers have eaten more. In terms of funds, the production leap forward requires a significant increase in the production funds required in various places. However, since diversified operations were not closely pursued in the previous stage, the funds of some cooperatives are also relatively tight. The pocket money of cooperative members is also tight. If the issues of money and grain are not promptly resolved before rice transplanting, production may be affected during the busy spring plowing season. After these problems were pointed out during the inspection, various localities took concrete measures and started to solve them. In solving the food ration problem, the main thing is to rely on agricultural cooperatives and the masses, to adjust the grain supply between seasons, to continue to strengthen grain conservation, and to appropriately borrow a portion from the cooperative's reserve grain; in individual grain-deficient areas, the state will appropriately allocate a portion of grain to agricultural cooperatives to solve the difficulties of grain-deficient households. On the issue of funds, the main reliance is on agricultural cooperatives to earnestly carry out diversified operations, while the state's agricultural loans and advance purchase payments are quickly distributed to the cooperatives through further thorough accounting, combined with the supply of materials, so that reasonable arrangements can be made early. Secondly, strengthen the work of credit cooperatives, organize the turnover of idle rural funds, support production, and solve the difficulties of cooperative members' lives.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 20th – The spring production general inspection in various parts of Shandong Province closely focuses on the two central tasks of wheat field management and spring sowing.

    The Liaocheng and Huimin Inspection General Delegation, upon arriving in Huantai County, selected the most vigorous wheat seedling-growing Qianjin Cooperative as the focus of the inspection, and convened an on-site meeting in this cooperative, with the participation of five levels of secretaries: the Provincial Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committee, the County Party Committee, the Township Party Committee, and the Cooperative Branch. Many county, township, and cooperative Party committee secretaries, upon seeing that the wheat field management work of the Qianjin Cooperative was well done and that the wheat was growing vigorously, rushed back overnight to spread the experience.

    In the inspection, inspection teams in various places implemented the methods of listening, watching, doing, transmitting, and helping, as instructed by the Provincial Party Committee. While listening to reports and visiting the site, many members of the inspection team actively participated in labor. As soon as the Bin County Inspection Team organized by the Huimin area arrived at Zhangjiaji, cooperative members were repairing roads. The inspection team staff immediately put down their vehicles and worked with the cooperative members. The cooperative members approved highly and immediately wrote a big-character poster praising the inspection team. The inspection team organized by Tancheng County saw that the farmers in Xiaoxiangzhuang, Honghua Township, did not know how to open corn ditches or how to make dense planting row spacing. The inspection team members took rulers and tools and led the cooperative cadres and members to make samples on the spot. The cooperative members reflected, “In the past, inspections only looked for shortcomings. This inspection taught us methods, really like a technical team!”

    The inspection team also found three more prominent problems in various places: First, a considerable number of township and cooperative production leap forward plans after revision have not met the masses and organized mass discussions, so that the county and township are one plan, and the cooperative and team are another plan, which will inevitably affect the further development of mass enthusiasm; second, some townships and cooperatives have not highlighted the two central tasks of wheat field management and spring sowing according to the current busy farming season, and still mobilized a considerable part of the labor force to carry out farmland basic construction projects such as repairing reservoirs and digging fish-scale pits that can be carried out even if not in the busiest part of the season; third, the improvement of cultivation techniques and the reform of tools have not attracted widespread attention in various places, and some areas have a phenomenon of simply relying on physical strength in situations where all work needs to leap forward. In order to solve the above problems, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to launch a province-wide great debate on production planning (including appropriate arrangements for farm work according to the season) and technological innovation in conjunction with current production. In the debate, find practical measures to increase production and find the tricks to improve technology and improve tools, to ensure the victorious realization of the production increase plan.

    检查出问题马上就解决
    湖南山东春耕检查团着重解决劳动力和春耕问题
    本报讯　湖南省春耕生产检查团已完成了对全省各地备耕工作的大检查。根据最近各地反映，这次检查收效较大，摸清了当前农村工作中的底细，及时发现了几个重大问题，促使各地更加扎实地作好一切备耕工作。
    检查团发现并正努力解决的重要问题，有以下三个：
      （一）随着生产大跃进形势的发展，湖南农村中劳力不足的问题越来越尖锐。据检查发现，湖南许多县的劳力赤字在30％左右，有些地方竟达40％以上。几个月来，农村中日夜加工赶工的现象相当普遍。在这种情形下，少数人就产生了畏缩情绪，对生产大跃进抱有疑虑；多数人则采取加强劳动强度的办法来缓和矛盾。这种精神虽好，但是，不可能持久。还有一部分人则采取放手发动群众，积极领导群众，用改良工具、改进操作技术和改善劳动管理的办法来解决这个困难，并且收到了很大的效果。省委研究了以上情况和问题之后，要求各地放手发动群众，克服保守思想，干劲之外再加上钻劲，多快好省地进行技术改革，解决劳力不足困难，推动春耕生产。在各地党委大力领导下，全省的工具改革运动正迅速地深入地开展起来。截至目前，据湘潭、常德等四十七个县的调查，已创造和改良的工具共一万六千多种，普遍在各乡推广，这些地区劳力不足的紧张局面，已相当缓和。
    （二）抓着以粮食生产为主，进一步开展多种经营，克服单打一现象。检查中发现，许多地方由于前一阶段集中力量突击水利、积肥，忽视了开展多种经营生产，给当前农村经济生活带来了一定程度的紧张。据调查，在1957年湖南省的农副业总产值中，粮食作物和大豆以外的多种经营收入占53％，部分地方竟达到60％以上，根据国家建设和农业发展需要，多种经营产值还应逐年增大。省委指出，解决这个问题的中心关键还是解决劳力不足困难。因此，要求各地立即采取措施，放手发动群众，改进生产和运输工具，改善生产管理，提高劳动效率，合理安排劳力，努力克服困难。同时还指出，开展多种经营生产最切实的保证，是全省各农业社组织几十万人的多种经营专业队。这种专业队，农忙时由社统一调配，突击支援粮食生产；农闲时则以专业队为骨干，由社调配劳力支援专业生产。这样，粮食生产和多种经营生产就能互相支援，全面发展。
    （三）解决了部分地区已经露头的口粮和钱的紧张现象。今年全省农户的用粮情况是好的，有80％的户做到了按计划用粮（内有15％—30％的户有节余），有20％左右的户由于一些原因粮食超过定量。亏粮食的现象，在去年受灾的地区和产杂粮多的地区较为突出，其原因主要是从去冬以来劳动一直很紧张，劳力强的多吃了一些。资金方面，根据生产跃进要求，各地所需生产资金大大增加了。但是，由于前一阶段没抓紧搞多种经营生产，因此部分社的资金也比较紧张。社员零用钱也紧了。钱粮问题如在插秧前不抓紧解决，到春耕大忙时期，就可能使生产受到影响。这些问题经检查指出后，各地就采取具体措施，着手解决。在解决口粮问题上，主要是依靠农业社、依靠群众，通过调整季节之间的粮食供应，继续加强节约用粮，并从社内的储备粮中适当借给一部分；在个别缺粮地区，则由国家粮食中适当拨出一部分借给农业社，解决缺粮户的困难。在资金问题上，主要依靠农业社认真开展多种经营解决，同时国家的农贷与预购款也通过进一步彻底算账，结合物资供应迅速分配到社，使能早作合理安排；其次，就是加强信用社的工作，组织农村闲散资金的周转，支持生产和解决社员生活困难。
    新华社济南20日电　山东省各地春季生产大检查，都紧紧围绕麦田管理和春耕播种两个中心任务。
    聊城、惠民检查总团到达桓台县后，选定麦苗最旺盛的前进社作为检查重点，并在这个社召开了现场会议，有省委、地委、县委、乡党委、社支部五级书记参加了大检查。许多县、乡、社的党委书记看到前进社麦田管理工作做得好，麦子生长旺盛的情况，许多干部星夜赶回传播经验。
    各地检查团在检查中都贯彻执行了省委指示的听、看、干、传、帮的方法。他们在听汇报、实地参观的同时，许多检查团的成员也积极参加劳动。惠民地区组织的滨县检查团一到张家集，社员正在修公路，检查团工作人员马上放下车子，和社员一起劳动，社员们很赞成，立即写出大字报表扬了检查团。郯城县组织的检查团看到红花乡小向庄农民不会开玉米沟，不会做密植的行距，检查团的人员就带着尺子、工具，带领社干部、社员就地做出样子。社员反映，过去检查光找缺点，这次检查教俺办法，真像个技术团的样子！
    检查团在各地还发现较突出的三个问题：一是有相当一部分乡社修订后的生产跃进规划，没有和群众见面，组织群众讨论，以致县、乡是一个规划，社、队则是另一个规划，这样势必影响群众积极性的进一步发挥；二是有些乡社没有根据当前的农忙季节突出地抓麦田管理和春播这两项中心任务，仍然动员了相当一部分人力进行不在大忙中也可进行的修水库和挖鱼鳞坑的农田基本建设工程；三是对改进耕作技术和改革工具没有引起各地普遍注意，有些地区在各项工作都需跃进的情况下有单纯拼体力的现象。为解决上述问题，中共山东省委已确定结合当前生产展开一个全省性的生产规划（包括按季节恰当地安排农活）、技术革新问题的大辩论，在辩论中找出切实的增产措施和找寻改进技术改进工具的窍门，以保证增产计划的胜利实现。
