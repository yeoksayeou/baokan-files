The People's Capital Cannot Tolerate the Survival of Sparrows
Three Million People Mobilized and Eliminated 83,000 on the First Day

    This newspaper reports that, starting at 5:00 AM on the 19th, the capital set up a dragnet to encircle and suppress the pest bird – the sparrow. After a full day of battle by three million people in the city, the results were extremely brilliant. As of 10:00 PM on the 19th, according to incomplete statistics, the city had cumulatively killed 83,249 sparrows by exhaustion, poisoning, and shooting.

    Around 4:00 AM on the 19th, the capital's millions-strong sparrow-extermination army picked up gongs, drums, noisemakers, bamboo poles, and colorful flags, and began to head to their designated battle positions. Poisoned bait was scattered in more than 830 baiting areas, and a large number of sharpshooters were ambushed in more than 200 shooting areas. At exactly 5:00 AM, as Deputy Mayor Wang Kunlun, the general commander of the Beijing sparrow extermination, gave the order, the vast area of over 8,700 square kilometers of the city immediately resounded with gongs and drums, firecrackers and gunshots, and the waving of colorful flags. Everywhere – on roofs, on trees, on streets, in courtyards – were people, with tens of millions of eyes watching the sky. Fake people and straw men swayed in the wind, also coming to help. Whether they were white-haired elderly people or children of a few years old; whether they were workers, peasants, cadres, students, or soldiers, everyone held weapons and did their best. The whole city formed a massive scene of "sparrows crossing the street, everyone shouts to kill them." The bombarded sparrows flew around in the dragnet, unable to find a place to rest. Some exhausted sparrows were driven into the baiting and shooting areas where poison bait was placed. Some died from eating poisoned rice; others died from being shot.

    In order to find out the "enemy situation," the sparrow extermination headquarters also dispatched thirty motorcycles to scout in all directions. Sharpshooters from the People's Liberation Army also rushed to places such as Babaoshan to support the extermination of sparrows. The city and district commanders and deputy commanders took vehicles to direct operations separately.

    In the Temple of Heaven "war zone," there were firecrackers and gongs and drums everywhere, and more than thirty sharpshooters were ambushed in the extermination zone. They exterminated 966 sparrows in one day, of which 40% died from exhaustion. In the poisoned baiting zone of the Chengshousi Production Station in Dongtiejiaoying Township, Nanyuan, 400 sparrows were poisoned to death in two hours. In the Taoranting area of Xuanwu District, a total of two thousand residents were mobilized to exterminate sparrows. They drove the sparrows to the extermination zone of Taoranting Park and the poison bait area of the Taoranting Swimming Pool, and eliminated 512 sparrows in most of the day. In the area within ten li around Yuyuantan in Haidian District, more than 3,000 people attacked the sparrows from both land and water. People drove the sparrows from all directions to the trees in the heart of the lake, and sharpshooters drove small boats to concentrate their fire. Only the shot and exhausted sparrows were seen falling into the water one after another.

    After dusk, youth commando teams went to forests, city walls, eaves, and other places to dig out nests, block nests, and catch sparrows. The people of the city are recuperating to welcome the battle of the new day.

    人民首都不容麻雀生存
    三百万人总动员第一天歼灭八万三
    本报讯　从19日清晨五时开始，首都布下天罗地网，围剿害鸟——麻雀。全市三百万人民经过整日的战斗，战果极为辉煌。到19日下午十时止，据不完全统计，全市共累死、毒死、打死麻雀八万三千二百四十九只。
    19日清晨四时左右，首都数百万剿雀大军拿起锣鼓响器、竹竿彩旗，开始走向指定的战斗岗位。八百三十多个投药区撒上了毒饵，二百多个射击区埋伏了大批神枪手。五时正，当北京市围剿麻雀总指挥王昆仑副市长一声令下，全市八千七百多平方公里的广大地区里，立刻锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，枪声轰响，彩旗摇动，房上、树上、街上、院里到处是人，千千万万双眼睛监视着天空。假人、草人随风摇摆，也来助威。不论白发老人或几岁小孩；不论是工人、农民、干部、学生、战士，人人手持武器，各尽所能。全市形成了一个声势浩大的“麻雀过街，人人喊打”的局面。被轰赶的麻雀在天罗地网中到处乱飞，找不着栖息之所。一些疲于奔命的麻雀被轰入施放毒饵的诱捕区和火枪歼灭区。有的吃了毒米中毒丧命；有的在火枪声里中弹死亡。
    为了摸清“敌情”，围剿麻雀总指挥部还派出三十辆摩托车四出侦察。解放军的神枪手也驰赴八宝山等处支援歼灭麻雀。市、区总指挥、副指挥等乘车分别指挥作战。
    在天坛“战区”，到处是鞭炮和锣鼓声，三十多个神射手埋伏在歼灭区里。他们一天之中歼灭麻雀九百六十六只，其中累死的占40％。在南苑东铁匠营乡承寿寺生产站的毒饵诱扑区，在两个小时内就毒死麻雀四百只。宣武区陶然亭一带共出动了两千居民围剿麻雀，他们把麻雀哄赶到陶然亭公园的歼灭区和陶然亭游泳池的毒饵区里，在大半天时间里，共消灭麻雀五百十二只。在海淀区玉渊潭四周十里的范围内，三千多人从水、旱两路夹攻麻雀。人们从四面八方把麻雀赶到湖心树上，神枪手驾着小船集中射击，只见被打死和疲惫不堪的麻雀纷纷坠落水中。
    傍晚以后，青年突击队到树林、城墙、房檐等处掏窝、堵窝，捕捉麻雀。全市人民正在养精蓄锐，好迎接新的一天的战斗。
