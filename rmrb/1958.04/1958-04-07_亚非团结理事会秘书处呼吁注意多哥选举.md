    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 5th. The Permanent Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement on the 5th, calling on the French, the Togolese, and the United Nations representatives: The general election to be held in Togo on April 27 should be free and in accordance with the legitimate aspirations of the Togolese people.
    The Secretariat also requested the Afro-Asian people to pay close attention to this election, and suggested that the governments of Afro-Asian countries and the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committees request to observe this election as observers.
    Togo is located in West Africa, adjacent to the newly independent Ghana. Before World War I, it was a German colony, and was later divided by Britain and France, and occupied under the name of "trusteeship." The British trusteeship area has been incorporated into Ghana with the consent of the United Nations. The remaining French trusteeship area will soon hold a general election under the supervision of the United Nations, and the elected legislative assembly will decide the future of Togo.

    亚非团结理事会秘书处
    呼吁注意多哥选举
    据新华社开罗5日电　亚非人民团结理事会常设秘书处5日发表声明，向法国人、多哥人和联合国代表呼吁：定于4月27日在多哥举行的大选应当是自由和符合于多哥人民的正当愿望的。
    秘书处还要求亚非人民密切注视这次选举，并且建议亚非各国政府和亚非人民团结委员会要求以观察员身份观察这次选举。
    多哥位于非洲西部，同刚独立的加纳毗邻。第一次世界大战前原是德国的殖民地，后来被英法瓜分，并分别以“托管”名义加以占领。英国托管区已经在联合国同意下并入加纳。剩下的法国托管区即将由联合国监督举行全民选举，选举产生的立法议会将决定多哥的前途。
