    Jumping Out of Economics to Find Politics, Examining Ideology Through Technology
    Relying on Mass Debate to Solve Key Problems
    The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry's Fifth Design Institute Achieves Great Results in the "Double-Anti" Debate

    (Our reporter, Lian Yunshan, reports) The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry's Fifth Design Institute, in its debate against conservatism and waste, has thoroughly implemented the policy of boldly mobilizing the masses. At the same time, it has adopted the method of "jumping out of economics to find politics, examining ideology through technology," enabling the "Double-Anti" campaign and rectification debate to be carried out deeply, broadly, vividly, and actively. This has resulted in a series of practical effects in promoting both business work and improving political thought. Now, everyone is in a cheerful mood, and the entire institute has a new look.

    The Masses Themselves Organize Big-Character Posters and Select Debate Topics, Quickly Leading to the Emergence of Over 300 Debate Topics Throughout the Institute.

    The debate at the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry's Fifth Design Institute began in early March, after the masses used the raging fire of tens of thousands of big-character posters to fiercely attack conservatism, waste, the "three evils," and the "five airs." Their approach started with organizing the big-character posters, calling on everyone to personally organize their own posters, select what they considered the most important issues that needed to be resolved quickly, and propose debates.

    Subsequently, mass debates began. Initially, debates focused on differing opinions on existing problems within each group and section, resolving a large number of relatively easy-to-solve issues first, then gradually moving from small to large, guiding the masses to debate key issues. As a result, the entire institute, from upstairs to downstairs, corridors to walls, was divided into blocks of specialized debate "battlefields," with big-character posters from both sides of the argument pasted on them. At the beginning of the debate, more than 300 debate topics emerged throughout the institute. These topics included design business and technical issues, as well as political and ideological issues, and were fundamental issues with universal significance in design departments. Debating these issues was of great interest to the leadership and all engineering and technical personnel.

    Everyone Should Apply the Political Enthusiasm of Writing Big-Character Posters to the Debate, Boldly Defending Their Own Views, Not Being Ambiguous.

    In order to ensure the debate was conducted well, the design institute continuously carried out political and ideological mobilization. For example, the leadership proposed that everyone should apply the high level of political enthusiasm of writing big-character posters to the debate. What do you advocate, what do you oppose? Select topics, line up formations, present viewpoints, recruit soldiers and generals, expand strength, find opponents, engage in debate, cooperate in combat if views are the same, debate small topics in small debates, debate large topics in large debates, and persuade the entire group, section, and institute to agree with their own views. They demanded that everyone act as masters of the design institute, dare to defend their own views vigorously, not be ambiguous, and strive to fight a war of annihilation in the movement against conservatism and waste.

    During the debate, the leadership constantly emphasized the need to closely integrate business and technical issues with political and ideological issues. If political and ideological issues were discussed in a vacuum without mentioning business and technology, everyone would be on the same side, and the debate would not start. If only business and technical issues were presented without raising them to the level of political and ideological understanding, the debate would become a technical formula calculation and data competition, which would not only fail to solve the problem but would also gradually cause the masses to lose interest in the debate. The design institute also required leaders at all levels to act as ordinary soldiers, presenting their ideological viewpoints and participating in the debate in the same way as the masses.

    The Number of Debate Topics Gradually Decreases, the Scale of the Debate Becomes Larger and Larger, and the Debate Finally Concentrates on Several Fundamental and Major Issues.

    As the debate developed, many smaller problems were solved, and the topics gradually narrowed, from over 300 to 100 plus, 90 plus, 60 plus, and 30 plus. The scale of the debate also became larger and deeper. In order to prove that their opinions were correct, everyone did their best to find materials, find arguments, study and supplement and revise their views, study the strengths and weaknesses of the other side, persuade those who wavered on the other side, attract onlookers, and so on. The debate on many issues lasted for more than a week, attracting dozens to hundreds of engineering and technical personnel to participate, often debating until late at night without feeling tired.

    Finally, the debate focused on several major issues. For example, could design time be shortened? Could design procedures be simplified? Could the design standards and norms stipulated by the state be broken through and applied flexibly? Was it impossible to achieve good quality, high speed, and cost-effectiveness in design? These issues were fundamental and universal issues in design departments, and the debate was very intense. For example, the faction that advocated that design specifications could be applied flexibly and design procedures could be simplified listed a large number of facts to show that the current design and construction specifications were generally set too high, exceeding the living standards of the Chinese people, and that a large amount of investment was wasted as a result. The design procedures were also quite complicated, but in fact, many places were divorced from reality. This resulted in a long design time (designing a factory generally takes three years), which increased construction investment and delayed construction speed. Therefore, the procedures should be greatly simplified, design labor procedures should be merged and adjusted, etc., and design time should be shortened, starting from the state's financial situation and from reality. However, the other faction firmly opposed this approach, arguing that the current design standards and existing procedures stipulated by the state were the crystallization of modern science and technology and the accumulation of experience from advanced countries. This faction also admitted that some local standards were indeed too high, but they cited calculated figures to prove that spending a few more yuan now could save several times or dozens of times more yuan in the future. Therefore, it could not be considered a waste. This faction was accused by the former of having a conservative technical ideology, adhering to the rules, designing with their eyes closed, not looking at the actual situation, and not feeling pain when spending money lavishly, which was the style of a rich young master. The latter did not show weakness either, believing that the former's advocacy of breaking through norms, appropriately lowering standards, and implementing simplified procedures was a backward approach that did not look forward, and was a promoter of regression. They particularly pointed out that our technical level was still far inferior to those who formulated the norms and regulations, so we should first execute the norms and standards well and not doubt them. We would only be qualified to study breakthroughs after our level had improved in the future. Such debates not only involved business and technology but also had rich political and ideological content. For example, in the debate on whether high speed and cost-effectiveness could not be achieved in design at the same time, one faction believed that as long as the complex drawings and diagrams were greatly simplified, the procedures were rationally adjusted, and departmentalism was broken, speed could be increased and quality could be guaranteed. Many people proposed many measures and even drew flow charts to demonstrate that their views were correct. However, another faction believed that it would be difficult to guarantee quality if speed was accelerated. They believed that the design speed should basically follow the current procedures. If the current set of procedures was broken through, it would only be possible to estimate with one's eyes closed, not design. This kind of debate also had rich business and political content, and the debate was very intense.

    Selecting Self-Designed and Completed Factories for Analysis and Dissection, Using Facts to Refute the Argument that Design Standards Cannot Be Broken Through and Procedures Cannot Be Simplified, as well as the Theory that Speed and Quality Are Opposed.

    As the debate deepened, the leadership, according to the needs of the masses, selected a factory designed by the design institute and now completed as a "sparrow" for analysis and dissection by all design procedures and sections of the institute. After checking drawings, calculating detailed accounts, interviewing workers and owners, and implementing the method of "jumping out of economics to find politics, examining ideology through technology" in the debate, the argument that design standards could not be broken through and procedures could not be simplified was finally refuted one by one. This faction themselves discovered that it was indeed "conservative thinking at work," clarifying that specifications and procedures should be determined according to the actual situation and could be modified. At the same time, the theory that speed and quality were opposed was also refuted, the understanding that high speed, good quality, and cost-effectiveness were unified was established, the theories of "only seeing the power of equipment, not seeing the role of people" and "design is a technical product" were smashed, and the idea that technology should serve politics was established. The ideological style of closed-door design, arrogance, departmentalism, and individual work was also broken, and the ideological concept of needing to connect with reality, learn with humility, and cooperate collectively was established. A strict criticism was carried out on the ideological style of engineering designers in the past who were divorced from politics, divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and divorced from policies in their work. As a result, the entire institute achieved a new consensus in terms of new political understanding, new design ideas, and new work style.

    Combining Debate and Rectification, Rectifying as soon as the Debate is Finished, Rectifying and Establishing Simultaneously, with Bountiful Results of Rectification and a New Look Throughout the Institute.

    Because the design institute has always adhered to the principle of combining debate and rectification, rectifying as soon as the debate is finished, and rectifying and establishing simultaneously, every problem, after the debate is completed, bears fruit, reaping a rectification and leap forward effect. Now, the fruits are bountiful, and the entire institute has a new look.

    First of all, through debate, they have already modified 577 items in the projects they are currently designing and have already designed but not yet constructed, saving the country a construction investment equivalent to 770,000 taels of gold.

    The second is shortening the design time. In the past, the design of a general factory required three years to complete. Now, it only takes three to six months to complete the design. For example, the preliminary design of a general machine factory used to take five months, but now it only takes half a month. The construction drawing design of a factory workshop used to take seven months, but now it only takes one month.

    Third, measures have been found that can be used to build two factories with the investment used to build one factory during the First Five-Year Plan, or to build three factories with the money used to build two factories, without reducing the scale of production or the level of technology. For example, after detailed calculations, a factory that used to require an investment of 140 million yuan now only requires 77 million yuan to build. A factory that used to require an investment of 50 million yuan will only require 29 million yuan in the future.

    Fourth, a design team of 400 people, combining professional and amateur personnel, has been organized and can complete the typical design of general-purpose machinery and other types of factories applicable to the provincial, special, and county levels within one month.

    Now, this design institute is preparing to continue to deepen the debate on who to design for and the two lines in design on the basis of having eliminated conservative thinking, and to take advantage of the victory to enter the debate on "redness" and expertise.

    跳出经济找政治　透过技术查思想
    依靠群众辩论　解决关键问题
    第一机械工业部第五设计院双反辩论收获很大
    本报讯　记者连云山报道：第一机械工业部第五设计院在反保守反浪费的辩论中，由于贯彻了大胆放手走群众路线的方针，同时采取了“跳出经济找政治，透过技术查思想”的办法，使“双反”和整改的辩论开展得又深又广，生动活泼，收到了业务工作跃进和政治思想提高的一系列实效；现在是人人心情舒畅，全院一片新气象。
    群众自己整理大字报，自己挑选辩论题目，全院迅速出现了三百多个争辩专题。
    第一机械工业部第五设计院的辩论，是在3月初群众以十几万张大字报的烈火，猛烧保守浪费，“三害”，“五气”后开始的。他们的做法是从整理大字报入手，号召群众人人动手整理自己的大字报，挑选出自己认为最重要的需要很快解决的问题，提出辩论。
    接着，群众性的辩论开始了。先从对本组本科存在问题的分歧意见辩论起，先解决大量的较易解决的问题，再由小而大，引导群众争辩关键问题。于是全院的楼上楼下，走廊墙壁，都被划分为一块块的专题辩论“战场”，上面贴着双方论战的大字报。在辩论开始时，全院就出现了三百多个争辩的专题。这些专题既是设计业务技术问题，也是政治思想问题，是在设计部门中带有普遍意义的根本性问题。争辩这些问题，是领导方面和所有工程技术人员都有浓厚兴趣的。
    人人要把写大字报的政治热情运用到辩论中去，大胆为自己的观点辩护，不做模棱两可的人。
    为了使辩论开展得好，这个设计院还不断进行政治思想动员。例如领导上提出了人人要把写大字报的高度政治热情运用到辩论中去，自己提倡什么，反对什么？要选题列阵，摆出观点，招兵请将，壮大力量，寻找对手，交锋争辩，观点相同，联合作战，小题小辩，大题大辩，说服全组、全科、全院都同意自己的观点。他们要求人人要做设计院的主人，敢于为自己的观点竭力辩护，不做模棱两可的人，又要勇于接受正确意见，争取在反保守反浪费运动中打歼灭战。
    在辩论中领导上又不断提出要把业务技术问题同政治思想问题密切结合起来，空谈政治思想不谈业务技术，大家都是一边倒，辩不起来。如果只摆业务技术问题，不提高到政治思想认识问题，就会使辩论变成一种技术程式演算和资料竞赛会，不但不解决问题，群众也会逐渐失去辩论兴趣。这个设计院还要求各级领导干部要做普通一兵，无例外地同群众一样摆思想观点，参加辩论。
    辩论的题目逐渐减少，辩论的规模愈来愈大，辩论最后集中到几个带根本性的重大问题上。
    随着辩论的发展，很多较小的问题解决了，论题逐渐集中，从三百多个到一百几，九十几，六十几，三十几个。辩论的规模也就随之越来越大，越来越深。为了证明自己的意见正确，大家都竭尽所能找资料、找论据，研究和补充修正自己的看法，研究对方的长处短处，说服对方的动摇者，拉旁听者等等。不少问题的辩论持续一周以上，吸引了几十到几百名工程技术人员参加，常常辩到深夜还毫无倦意。
    最后，辩论集中到几个重大的问题上了。例如设计时间能否缩短？设计程序能否简化的问题；国家规定的设计标准规范能否突破和灵活运用的问题；设计要“多快”是否就不能好省的问题。这些问题都是设计部门带有根本性的普遍问题，辩论十分激烈。例如主张设计规范可以灵活运用，设计程序可以简化的一派，列出了大量的事实说明：现在设计建筑规范要求，一般订得偏高，超过我国人民生活水平，大量投资的浪费即由此而来，设计程序也相当繁复，其实很多地方是脱离实际的。这使得设计时间拖得很长（设计一个工厂一般需要三年时间），加大了建设投资，延缓了建设速度。因此应该从国家财经状况出发，从实际出发，大大精简程序，合并和调整设计劳动工序等等，缩短设计时间。但是另一派坚决反对这种做法，他们认为：现时国家规定的设计标准和现行程序，是现代科学技术的结晶，是先进国家的经验积累。这一派也承认有些地方标准确实过高，但他们列举了计算数字证明：现在多花几个钱，将来可以少花几倍、几十倍的钱。因此不能认为是浪费。这一派被前者指为技术思想保守，墨守陈规，闭着眼设计，不看实际状况，大手花钱不心痛，是阔公子作风。而后者也不示弱，认为前者主张突破规范，适当降低标准，实行简化程序等等是不朝前看的倒退做法，是促退派。他们特别指出我们的技术水平还远不如制定规范和法规的人，因此首先应该好好执行规范标准，不应怀疑。将来水平提高后才有资格去研究突破。这样的辩论不仅有业务技术，而且有丰富的政治思想内容。又如关于设计中多快和好省不能兼顾的争论，一派认为：只要大力精简繁复的图纸、图面，合理调整工序，打破本位主义等，就能提高速度，保证质量，不少人提出了许多措施，甚至划了流水作业图表，论证自己的看法正确。但是另一派人认为，要加快速度就很难保证质量，他们认为：设计速度基本上还应该按现在程序进行，如果突破现在的一套程序，那只有闭着眼去估计，而不是设计了。这种争论也是具有丰富的业务和政治内容，辩论十分激烈。
    选择自己设计的、已经建成的工厂进行分析解剖，用事实驳倒了主张设计标准不能突破、程序不能简化的论据，以及速度与质量对立论。
    随着辩论的深入进行，领导方面根据群众的需要选择了经过本设计院设计的、现已建成的一个厂作为“麻雀”，全院各设计工序和各科，都根据自己的专业对这个厂进行分析解剖。经过查图纸，算细账，访问工人和业主等等，再加辩论中实行“跳出经济找政治，透过技术查思想”的办法，于是主张设计标准不能突破、程序不能简化的论据最后一一被驳倒，这派人自己发现确是“保守思想作怪”，明确了规范和程序应该是根据实际情况而定，是可以修改的。同时还驳倒了速度与质量对立论，认识了多快好省是统一的，粉碎了“只见设备的力量，不见人的作用”和“设计是技术产物”论，树立了技术应为政治服务的思想。还打破了关门设计、妄自尊大、本位主义、个人单干的思想作风，树立了必须联系实际、虚心学习、集体协作的思想观念。对以往工程设计人员在工作中脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离群众、脱离政策的思想作风，进行了严格的批判。于是，全院人员在新的政治认识、新的设计思想和新的工作作风等方面取得了新的一致见解。
    辩论和整改相结合，辩完就改，边改边立，整改果实累累，全院一片新气象。
    由于这个设计院始终坚持了辩论和整改相结合的方针，辩完就改，边改边立，因而每个问题辩论完了后就结一个果实，收一个整改和跃进实效。现在是果实累累，全院一片新气象。
    首先，通过辩论，他们已经把正在手头设计和已经做好设计尚未施工的项目修改了五百七十七项，为国家节约了相当七十七万两黄金的建设投资。
    第二是缩短了设计时间，过去一般工厂的设计需要三年才能完成，现在只要三个月到六个月就可以设计完毕。如某通用机器厂初步设计过去需要五个月，现在只半个月就设计完了。某厂工房施工图设计，过去需要七个月，现在一个月就设计完了。
    第三，已经找到了措施，可以在不降低生产规模和技术水平的条件下，用第一个五年计划期间建一个厂的投资建两个厂，或者用两个厂的钱建三个厂，例如：经过详细的计算，过去投资一亿四千万元的厂，现在再建只需七千七百万元。过去投资五千万元的厂，今后只需二千九百万元。
    第四，已经组织了一个专业和业余相结合的四百人的设计队伍，可在一个月内完成省、专、县三级适用的通用机械等类工厂的典型设计。
    现在这个设计院，正准备在已经取得的打掉保守思想的基础上继续深入展开为谁设计？设计中两条路线的辩论，趁胜进入红与专的辩论。
