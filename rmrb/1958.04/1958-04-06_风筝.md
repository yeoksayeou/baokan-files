Kites are also known as paper eagles, or, in ancient times, hawks. The reason they are called kites is that a silk string can be attached to the back of the paper eagle, and when placed in the air, the wind blows the string, creating a buzzing sound that is very pleasant. Therefore, paper eagles are also called kites. Some even attach wind-powered drums to the back of the paper eagle, and when the wind blows, the drums play in unison, resembling a celestial symphony resounding through the skies. It is said that kites were invented by Han Xin, but there is no historical basis for this. The "Du Yi Zhi" states, "When Hou Jing besieged Taicheng, Emperor Jianwen made a paper eagle and flew it to the outside to send an urgent message." If this is true, then kites have a history of 1,400 years. The "Liu Tie" and "Xun Chu Lu" both say that using kites for games began during the reign of Emperor Yin of the Later Han dynasty in the Five Dynasties period. There are not many historical records of kite stories, but there are many poems and songs about kites. In "Dream of the Red Chamber," there are even several wonderful poems about kites.

There are many types of kites. The earliest forms were those resembling kites (hawks), such as the fat sand kite, the thin sand kite, and the black pot bottom, which is simplified from the fat sand kite. All of these have wings with two concave centers, two figure-eight feet, and a head. The reason why sand kites and black pot bottoms resemble kites is mainly because the two eyebrows on their heads are raised high, somewhat like kite eyebrows. Therefore, there is a Beijing saying: "Why are you raising your eyebrows? Trying to imitate a sand kite?" Derived from the sand kite, those with two feet under the wings include butterflies, flying tigers, etc.; those with one foot (one leg curled up) include Nezha, Zhong Kui, Sun Wukong, cabbage, radish, etc. In addition, the four horizontal strokes of the double happiness character, which represent four wings, also belong to this category. Soft-tailed kites with two wings, such as dragon-eye fish and catfish, also belong to this category. These types of kites all have concave wings. Wings with concave pockets are easier to catch the wind and easier to fly, so many people fly them, and we call them kite-shaped.

The second category is the *pai zi* (paddle) shape. Wings without concave pockets, or even without wings, just plain flat surfaces, are all called *pai zi*. The main form of the *pai zi* is the octagonal Bagua. In addition, there are toad shapes, antique bottle shapes, and flower basket shapes. *Pai zi* are the most difficult to fly. A large tassel must be attached to the bottom of the *pai zi* to prevent it from tumbling. Among the *pai zi*, there is a special form, which is the centipede. In addition to the "helmet"-shaped centipede head, double wings, and soft tail, the centipede's body is segmented, with each segment having a large round light (the centipede's body), and two centipede legs extending from both sides of the round light. The segments are connected by two ropes. When flown, it vividly resembles a real centipede flying in the air.

The third category is the eagle shape. The eagle shape is like a golden eagle with its wings fully spread, with a hard head, hard body, and two large soft wings. The whole body is gray with black markings. When it soars in the air, it looks just like a real eagle taking to the sky. Thirty years ago, there was a small vendor in Beixinqiao, Beijing, named Si Long'er, whose golden eagle kites were the most famous.

The fourth category is three-dimensional kites. Its earliest form was the water bucket, so let's call it the bucket shape. The water bucket kite was also invented by the aforementioned Si Long'er. He initially made a cylindrical shape out of bamboo strips, pasted yellow paper on it, and drew black hoops. He tried to fly it, and it did fly, but it was not very stable (the round shape is even more difficult to catch the wind than a *pai zi* without concave pockets). After his research, he changed it to two parallel buckets, and this time it was indeed stable and could rise higher. Subsequently, he created the door lantern-shaped kite. Later, there was the airplane-shaped kite.

The changes in kites, the images are becoming more and more diverse, and the paintings are becoming more and more beautiful, but they generally do not go beyond the above four types. When the wind is gentle and the sun is warm, let's all go fly kites! (Attached picture)

    风筝
    金受申
    风筝就是纸鸢，古名叫鹞子。叫它风筝的原因，是因为纸鸢背后，可以装上用丝条做的弓弦，放在空中，风吹弦动，便发出嗡嗡的声音，非常好听，所以把纸鸢也叫风筝。也有在纸鸢背后，装上风车形式的锣鼓的，风吹锣鼓齐鸣，真像一部钧天仙乐，响彻云霄。据说风筝是韩信创兴的，但没有古书根据。“独异志”上说：“侯景围台城，简文做纸鸢，飞空告急于外。”这样，风筝也有一千四百年历史了。用风筝做游戏，“六帖”、“询刍录”两部书上，都说始于五代汉隐帝时。历代记风筝故事的文字不多，歌咏风筝的诗词却不少，“红楼梦”里，还有几首咏风筝的妙词呢。
    风筝的种类很多，最初的形式，就是那像鸢（鹞鹰）的沙雁——肥沙雁，瘦沙雁，和从肥沙雁简化来的黑锅底，都是有两个中心内凹的翅膀，两个八字脚，一个头。说沙雁、黑锅底像鸢的原因，主要是头上的两道眉毛高挑着，有点像鸢眉，所以北京有这么一句俗语：“干什么挑眉毛啊？学沙雁儿哪。”从沙雁衍化出来，翅子下面两个脚的，有蝴蝶、飞虎等；一个脚（一腿蜷起）的，有哪叱、锺馗、孙悟空、白菜、萝卜等。另外双喜字的四个横头，是四个翅膀，也属于这一类。软尾巴而有两翅的，如龙睛鱼、鲇鱼，也属于这一类，这一类风筝，翅膀都有凹兜。翅有凹兜，就容易受风，容易放起，所以放的人特别多，我们就管它叫鸢形吧。
    第二类是拍（排）子形。翅膀没有凹兜，甚至没有翅膀，只是光光平面的，都叫拍子。拍子主要形式是八角的八卦，另外有蛤蟆形、古瓶形、花篮形。拍子最难放，拍子下必须坠大繐子，才能免得折跟斗。拍子中另有一种特别形式的，那就是蜈蚣。蜈蚣除用“盔”出来的蜈蚣头，双翅软尾巴以外，蜈蚣身子却是一节一节的，每节一个大圆光（蜈蚣身子），圆光两旁伸出两支蜈蚣脚来，节与节之间，用两根绳联起来，放起来，活生生地像一条真蜈蚣在空中飞舞似的。
    第三类是鹰形。鹰形和完全展开了双翅的苍鹰一样，硬头，硬身子，两扇大软翅，全身灰色黑蚊，在空中盘旋起来，和真鹰拿空一样。三十年前，北京北新桥有一个小商贩，名字叫四龙儿的，做的苍鹰风筝最有名。
    第四类是立体的风筝，它最初的形式是水桶，咱们就叫它桶形吧。水桶风筝也是上面说的那个四龙儿发明的。他最初用竹篾做成一个圆桶形，上面糊上黄纸，画上黑箍，试着放一放，放是放起来了，但是不怎么平稳（圆形比没凹兜的拍子更难受风），经过他的研究，改为并列的双桶，这回果然平稳，果然能升高了。随后，又创制了门灯形风筝。再后，就有了飞机形风筝了。
    风筝的变化，形象越来越多，彩画越来越美丽，但总不出以上四种类型。风和日暖，大家去放风筝吧。（附图片）
