	Fooled!

	The Eisenhower Doctrine has been around for over a year since its inception. Lebanese Member of Parliament Bustani has concluded: "The Eisenhower Doctrine promoted by the United States in the Middle East has failed."

	Bustani pointed out that Lebanon was the first country to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine, and as a result, it only received 10 million US dollars. The so-called "huge aid" is nothing more than "an empty dream." What does this little bit of "dollar" mean to Lebanon? That is, "Lebanon is isolated among other Arab countries" and committed a "political error." The wave of dissatisfaction that appeared in the Lebanese parliament's debate on the 25th is certainly not accidental.

	Bustani frankly believes that Lebanon was fooled by the Eisenhower Doctrine. This is also his conclusion on the current pro-Western policy of the Lebanese government.

	Still Denying

	Indonesian officials have long possessed reliable materials proving that the United States supplied weapons to the rebels. In principle, with both human and material evidence, the US government should admit its bad luck and withdraw its black hand; however, the US State Department shamelessly continues to deny it. On the 25th, US State Department spokesman White said hard words: "I have said - I don't know how many times I have said - this statement is completely unfounded." Of course, no matter how many times it is said, it does not mean that no bad things have been done.

	However, White still let the cat out of the bag. He said that American experts have studied and there are many ways to transport American arms to the rebels "without US consent."

	White's words precisely admitted that the United States has more than one way to support the Indonesian rebels. The fact is indeed the case, for example, secretly supplying American arms to the rebels through the Chiang Kai-shek group or using the Philippines and Singapore. This is part of the method carefully designed by American experts.

    上了当！
    艾森豪威尔主义从出笼到现在一年有余，黎巴嫩的国会议员布斯坦尼给它作了结论：“美国在中东推行的艾森豪威尔主义已经失败”。
    布斯坦尼指出，黎巴嫩是第一个接受艾森豪威尔主义的国家，结果只得到一千万美元。所谓“巨大援助”，不过是“一场空梦”。这一点点“美元”对黎巴嫩来说意味着什么呢？那就是，“黎巴嫩在其他阿拉伯国家中陷于孤立”，犯了“政治错误”。黎巴嫩国会在25日的辩论中出现了一片不满声，当然不是偶然的。
    布斯坦尼坦率地认为：黎巴嫩上了艾森豪威尔主义的当。这又是他对目前黎巴嫩政府亲西方政策的结论。
    还在抵赖
    印度尼西亚官方早就掌握了可靠材料，证明美国供给叛乱分子以武器。按理说，人证物证俱在，美国官方就应该自认倒霉，缩回黑手才是；但是，美国国务院却厚着脸皮，一再抵赖。25日，美国国务院发言人怀特就大说硬话：“我已经说过——我不知道已经说了多少遍了——这种说法是完全没有根据的。”当然，无论说多少遍，并不等于没有干坏事。
    不过，怀特还是露出了马脚来。他说，美国的专家们研究过，有许多方法可以把美国的军火在“没有得到美国同意的情况下”运给叛乱分子。
    怀特的话恰恰是承认了美国接济印度尼西亚叛乱分子的方法不止一端。事实也正是这样，譬如，通过蒋介石集团或利用菲律宾和新加坡偷偷供应叛乱分子以美国军火。这就是美国专家们精心设计的方法的一部分。
