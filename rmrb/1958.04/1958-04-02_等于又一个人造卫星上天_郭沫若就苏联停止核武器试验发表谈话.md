Equivalent to Another Artificial Satellite in Orbit
Guo Moruo Issues Statement on Soviet Union's Cessation of Nuclear Weapons Testing

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st—Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, today issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the Soviet government's statement on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Soviet government's statement on March 31 regarding the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing is, as the People's Daily editorial said, "good news for humanity." This proposal is equivalent to another artificial satellite in orbit.

The harmfulness and destructiveness of nuclear weapons are well known. Scientists and peace-loving people around the world have continuously demanded the cessation of the manufacture, testing, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons. The Soviet government has also long expressed its willingness to accept the demands of the people, repeatedly suggesting to the United States and Britain that they cease nuclear weapon testing and use. However, the United States and Britain have put forward various excuses and have consistently violated the wishes of the people, refusing to accept the Soviet proposal.

The Soviet Union's unilateral decision to cease nuclear weapon testing is wholeheartedly welcomed by the people of all countries. We earnestly hope that the United States and British governments will adopt wise policies, respond to the Soviet proposal, and immediately cease nuclear weapon testing. We further hope that we can move from ceasing nuclear weapon testing to ceasing the manufacture, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons, so that atomic energy can fully serve peaceful production.

The Soviet Union has always strived to maintain world peace and ease international tensions. This proactive measure to cease nuclear weapon testing once again demonstrates the Soviet Union's firm and unwavering peace policy. It also shows the strength of the world peace forces led by the Soviet Union. If we say that this expression of peaceful strength is no less than the launch of an artificial satellite, I think it is by no means an exaggeration. The Soviet Union is at the forefront of nuclear weapon manufacture, but the Soviet Union has never used nuclear weapons to intimidate. On the contrary, today, for the happiness and security of all mankind, the Soviet Union has taken the step of ceasing testing. This fully proves the Soviet Union's selflessness. Here, we are reminded of the attitude expressed by the U.S. government when the United States first mastered the manufacture of atomic weapons in 1945. Scientists at the time were already opposed to the use of the atomic bomb, but the U.S. government blatantly disregarded the opposition of scientists and used atomic bombs against the peaceful residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. The U.S. President Truman at the time even called the mastery of the atomic bomb "God's gift." Since then, U.S. warmongers have frequently used atomic weapons to threaten all mankind. Comparing the attitude of the United States more than a decade ago with the attitude of the Soviet Union today, we can see which system is maintaining peace and which system is brewing war.

Today, in the face of the Soviet government's peaceful sincerity, we hope that the people of all countries in the world will jointly demand that the U.S. and British governments quickly respond to the Soviet proposal and take the same measures. World opinion has great power. If the peace-loving people of all countries in the world strengthen their calls to stop atomic war, we believe that it can prompt the authorities in the United States and Britain to change their attitude, which has always violated the will of the people.

We especially hope that the American people will exert their power over the warmongers in the United States. Due to the U.S.'s arms expansion and war preparations and atomic blackmail policy, the U.S. economy has shown serious signs of economic crisis. The number of unemployed has reached 5.3 million and is still increasing. Currently, if the American people can get the U.S. government to accept the Soviet proposal and change their warlike policy, it will make a great contribution to the happiness of the American people and to world peace.

Today is the time for the U.S. and British governments to clearly express their attitude. In particular, the U.S. government has stated that it will test nuclear weapons in the Pacific Ocean on April 5th. We hope that the U.S. government will stop it immediately. The Soviet government's statement is very clear: If the governments of other countries possessing nuclear weapons are unwilling to respond to the Soviet government's initiative and continue to carry out atomic and hydrogen weapon explosions, then the Soviet Union will still have to take actions that take into account its own security interests in the future on the issue of nuclear weapon testing. This is only natural. Therefore, we demand that the U.S. and British governments abandon all excuses and immediately take the same measures as the Soviet Union, and further reach an agreement to move from ceasing testing to ceasing manufacture, stockpiling, and use. Otherwise, it is clear that the U.S. and British governments will not be able to shirk their responsibility for threatening world peace and endangering human security. Peace-loving people around the world should unanimously condemn them. At that time, we can say with certainty: The warmongers who insist on the atomic blackmail policy are war criminals who are plotting atomic war.

"When ten fingers point, one dies without illness." Let us strengthen the power of public opinion, subdue the atomic war criminals, forever eliminate atomic war, and forever eliminate war!

### 等于又一个人造卫星上天  郭沫若就苏联停止核武器试验发表谈话

    等于又一个人造卫星上天
    郭沫若就苏联停止核武器试验发表谈话
    新华社1日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若今天就苏联政府关于停止原子武器和氢武器试验的声明对新华社记者发表了谈话。谈话的全文如下：
    苏联政府在3月31日发表的关于停止原子武器和氢武器试验的声明，的确像人民日报社论所说的，是“人类的福音”。这个建议，等于又一个人造卫星上天。
    核武器的危害性和毁灭性之大，是人所共知的。全世界的科学家和爱好和平的人民曾不断要求停止核武器的制造、试验、贮备和使用。苏联政府也早已表示愿意接受人民的要求，屡次向美国和英国建议停止核武器的试验和使用。但是美国和英国却提出种种借口，始终违反人民的愿望，不肯接受苏联的建议。
    苏联现在单方面停止核武器试验的决定，是世界各国人民衷心欢迎的。我们热切希望美国和英国政府采取明智的决策，响应苏联的建议，立即停止核武器的试验。我们更希望能进一步由停止核武器的试验做到停止核武器的制造、贮备和使用，使原子能全面为和平生产服务。
    苏联一向是为维护世界和平、和缓国际紧张局势而不断努力的。这次主动停止核武器试验的措施，再一次说明苏联的坚定不移的和平政策。同时也表明了苏联所领导的世界和平力量的壮大。如果说这一和平力量的表示，不亚于人造卫星的发射，我看是决不夸大的。在核武器的制造方面，苏联是走在最前列的，但是苏联从来没有拿核武器来进行恫吓。相反，今天苏联为了全人类的幸福和安全，更采取了停止试验的步骤。这就充分证明了苏联的大公无私。这里使我们联想到1945年美国最初掌握原子武器的制造的时候美国政府所表示的态度。对原子弹的使用，当时的科学家们早就是反对的，但是美国政府悍然不顾科学家们的反对，对日本广岛和长崎的和平居民使用了原子弹。当时的美国总统杜鲁门还把掌握了原子弹称为“上帝的付与”。从那时起，美国的好战分子就经常用原子武器来威胁全人类。把十几年前美国的态度同今天苏联的态度相比，就可以看出来那一个制度是维护和平、那一个制度是酝酿战争的。
    今天在苏联政府的和平诚意之前，我们希望全世界各国人民共同要求美国和英国政府迅速响应苏联建议，采取同样的措施。世界的舆论是有巨大力量的。世界各国爱好和平的人民如果加强制止原子战争的呼吁，我们相信，可以促使美国和英国的当局改变他们的一向违反人民意志的态度。
    我们将特别希望美国人民对美国的好战分子发挥他们的力量。由于美国的扩军备战和原子讹诈政策，美国的经济已经表现出严重的经济危机的征候，失业人数已达到五百三十万，还有增无已。目前如果美国人民能够使美国政府接受苏联的建议，改变他们的好战政策，对美国人民的幸福和世界和平是会有很大贡献的。
    今天是美国和英国政府明白地表示自己的态度的时候了。特别是美国政府曾经声言4月5日要在太平洋上试验核武器，我们希望美国政府立即加以停止。苏联政府的声明说得很清楚，如果拥有核武器的其他国家政府不愿意响应苏联政府的倡议，而仍然进行原子武器和氢武器爆炸，那末，苏联在核武器试验问题上今后仍将不得不采取考虑到本国安全利益的行动。这是理所当然的。因此，我们要求，美国和英国政府抛弃一切借口，立即采取和苏联一样的措施，并且更进一步达成协议，由停止试验进而停止制造、贮备和使用。否则很明显，美国和英国政府将不能推卸威胁世界和平和危害人类安全的责任。全世界爱好和平的人民应该一致加以谴责。在那时我们可以肯定地说：坚持原子讹诈政策的好战分子是策动原子战的战争罪犯。
    “十手所指，无病而死”。让我们加强舆论的力量，使原子战犯们屈服，永远消灭原子战，永远消灭战争！
