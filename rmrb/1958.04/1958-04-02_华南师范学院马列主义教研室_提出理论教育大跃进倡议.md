South China Normal College Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Office
Proposes Great Leap Forward Initiative in Theoretical Education

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Office of South China Normal College proposed a "Three Years of Hard Struggle to Implement a Great Leap Forward in Political Theory Education" initiative to the Marxism-Leninism Teaching and Research Offices of all higher education institutions nationwide on March 25th. Their slogans are "Overall Leap Forward, Diligent Study and Hard Work, Unity of Learning and Application, Both Red and Expert"; they aim to achieve one focus: wholeheartedly being a Marxist-Leninist propagandist; two oppositions: oppose revisionism, oppose dogmatism; three samenesses: eat, live, and labor with students; four abilities: able to teach, able to labor, able to do political and ideological work, able to do theoretical research; five comparisons: compare diligent study and hard work, compare linking with reality, compare linking with the masses, compare teaching effectiveness, compare theoretical research.
    The Propaganda Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China specially convened a symposium on the 26th, gathering political theory teachers from various universities, Party schools, Communist Youth League schools, and cadre schools in Guangzhou, to discuss the Normal College's initiative. At the meeting, the Political Theory Course Teaching and Research Group of Guangdong Educational Administration College was the first to respond. They proposed that lectures should be closely integrated with the current social and political movements, starting from the actual work and thinking of the students, and using the method of rectification to conduct teaching. In terms of theoretical research, within three years, in conjunction with teaching, propaganda work, and social and political movements, they will write a certain number of articles that can explain one or two specific practical problems with Marxist-Leninist theory.

    提出理论教育大跃进倡议
    本报讯　华南师范学院马列主义教研室于3月25日向全国各高等院校马列主义教研室提出“苦战三年，实行政治理论教育大跃进”的倡议。他们的口号是“全面跃进，苦学苦干，学用一致，又红又专”；要做到一心：一心做好马列主义宣传员；二反：反修正主义、反教条主义；三同：与同学同吃、同住、同劳动；四能：能教书、能劳动、能做政治思想工作、能做理论研究；五比：比苦学苦干、比联系实际、比联系群众、比教学效果、比理论研究。
    中共广东省委宣传部特于26日召集广州的各高等院校、党校、团校和各个干部学校的政治理论教员座谈师范学院的倡议。会上，广东教育行政学院政治理论课教研组首先响应。他们提出，讲课要密切结合当前的社会政治运动，从学员的工作、思想实际出发，运用整风的方法进行教学。在理论研究方面，三年内结合教学、宣传工作和社会政治运动，写出一定数量能以马列主义理论说明一两个具体实际问题的文章。
