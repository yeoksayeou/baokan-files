Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 5th April: April 5th marks the first anniversary of the establishment of the Communist Party of India (CPI)-led Kerala government. The Chief Minister of Kerala and member of the CPI Politburo, Namboodiripad, published an article in the "New Century" weekly, reviewing the various achievements of the Kerala government in its first year of governance.

He wrote: The first year of the Communist government in power has begun to break down the barriers between the Communist Party and the broad masses of people belonging to other parties. Those parties share the same national goal as the Communist Party, namely, the goal of building a socialist India.

The Kerala government's work in this year has also "effectively refuted the anti-communist argument that communist rule would mean the loss of everything good in national traditions and moral values."

All the work of the Kerala government has been based not only on the letter of the constitution, but also on the actual spirit of the constitution. Its goal is to "assist the peaceful transition from one socio-economic system to another."

The article cited various measures taken by the Kerala government in land reform to assist in changing land relations, such as the enactment of a bill to prevent the repossession of tenant farmland, a bill to provide relief to indebted farmers, the abolition of the "Janmikaram" special system of feudal landlords exploiting tenants, and finally the Land Relations Bill. The article stated that all these measures were "to help the vast poor masses in rural areas liberate themselves from the shackles of exploiters and enable them to be self-reliant."

Regarding the relationship between labor and capital, the article mentioned that the Kerala government did not allow the police and other organs of the state machinery to stand on the side of the capitalists against the workers. The policy pursued by Kerala is that the police force "is not used as a weapon to oppress the exploited class, but as a peaceful weapon used by the government to try to achieve major socio-economic reforms in a peaceful manner."

In response to anti-communist prejudices, Namboodiripad wrote: "Our aim is to be governed by a united front or a united government, if you will, composed of parties and individuals who accept socialist goals." He also wrote: "We hope that even the vast majority of Congressmen will gradually recognize the necessity of forming such a united government composed of all socialist-minded people in the country and will eventually join this united front."

    印共领导的喀拉拉邦政府
    一年来各方面都有成就
    ——南布迪里巴德著文列举事实——
    据新华社新德里5日电　4月5日是印度共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府成立一周年纪念日。喀拉拉邦首席部长、印共政治局委员南布迪里巴德在“新世纪”周刊上发表文章，回顾喀拉拉邦政府执政一年来的各项成就。
    他写道：共产党政府执政的第一年已经开始打破共产党和属于其他党派的广大人民群众之间的隔阂。那些党派和共产党抱有同样的国家目标，即建设社会主义印度的目标。
    喀拉拉邦政府在这一年的工作也“已经有效地打破所谓共产党执政会意味着丧失民族传统和道德价值中一切良好东西的那种反共论点”。
    喀拉拉邦政府所有工作，一直不仅是根据宪法的文字，而且是根据宪法的实际精神。它的目标是要“协助以和平方式使一种社会经济制度过渡到另一种社会经济制度”。
    文章举出喀拉拉邦政府为了协助改变土地关系在土地改革方面所采取的各种措施，如通过制止收回佃农租地的法案，对负债农民予以救济的法案，废除封建地主剥削佃户的“詹米卡拉姆”特别制度，最后是土地关系法案。文章说，所有这些措施是“要帮助农村广大的贫苦群众从剥削者的镣铐中解放出来，并使他们能够自立”。
    在劳工同资本家的关系方面，文章谈到，喀拉拉邦政府没有让警察和国家机器的其他机关站在资本家方面反对劳工，喀拉拉邦所奉行的政策是：警察部队“不是用来作为压迫被剥削阶级的武器，而是作为政府用来设法以和平方式实现重大的社会经济改革的和平武器”。
    在答复反共的偏见时，南布迪里巴德写道：“我们的目的是要由那些接受社会主义目标的各党派和社会人士组成联合阵线来执政，或组成联合政府，如果你愿意这样说的话。”他又写道：“我们希望：甚至广大的国大党人也会逐渐认识到由国内一切具有社会主义思想的人组成这样一种联合政府的必要，因而最后会参加这种联合阵线。”
