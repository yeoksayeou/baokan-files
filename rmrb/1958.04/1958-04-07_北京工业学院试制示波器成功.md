Beijing Institute of Technology has successfully produced a cathode ray oscilloscope, following its successful trial production of a three-phase dynamic strain gauge, resorcinol, and pulse tachometer.

The cathode ray oscilloscope is a valuable instrument widely needed in many industrial technology, scientific research departments, and teaching fields, with a typical oscilloscope costing around 2,000 yuan.

After a period of trial production, Beijing Institute of Technology has officially started producing the "Jinggong 571 Model" oscilloscope. This batch of products has been acquired by the Beijing Transportation Telecommunications Equipment Company, which considers the quality to fully meet the technical requirements. Currently, the institute is expanding production and further manufacturing the仿R·C·A WO—88A model oscilloscope with higher quality and wider applications.

    北京工业学院试制示波器成功
    北京工业学院在继三相动力应变仪、间苯三酚、脉冲转速表试制成功以后，又成功地生产了阴极射线示波器。
    阴极射线示波器是许多工业技术、科学研究部门以及教学方面广泛需用的贵重仪器，普通一台示波器价值二千元左右。
    北京工业学院经过一段时间的试制以后，已开始正式生产“京工571型”示波器，这一批产品已由北京市交通电讯器材公司收购，认为质量完全合乎技术要求。现在，该院正在扩大生产和进一步制造质量更高、用途更广的仿R·C·A WO—88A型示波器。
