Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: The Romanian government delegation, led by Chairman Chivu Stoica, left Beijing by special plane today for Northeast China. The distinguished guests will visit Anshan, Shenyang, and other places before proceeding to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a friendly visit.

At 8:30 AM, the national anthems of Romania and China were played at the newly built Capital Airport. Chairman Chivu Stoica, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor. Young women from the capital presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

Chairman Chivu Stoica delivered a warm farewell speech to the people of the capital. In his speech, he reiterated that the joint statement signed yesterday by the Romanian and Chinese governments demonstrated "the determination of the two governments and peoples to develop and deepen brotherly friendship and multi-faceted cooperation in the spirit of socialist internationalism, and to continuously strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the main guarantee of peace and security for all peoples. The joint statement also reflects our two countries' firm support for the policy of peaceful coexistence with countries of different social systems, and for easing international tensions and defending the cause of peace."

He also said: "Under the wise and long-tested leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant successes in the cause of transforming China into a strong socialist industrial power. Your achievements are our achievements, and a victory for the entire socialist camp and all forces of peace and progress."

Chairman Chivu Stoica, on behalf of the Romanian people, warmly congratulated the Chinese people on their continuous new victories in the cause of socialist construction and defending peace, and expressed his intention to convey the friendship of the Chinese people to the Romanian people.

Before Chairman Chivu Stoica's speech, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, delivered a speech to bid farewell to the distinguished guests, expressing his most sincere gratitude for their great contributions to further strengthening the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples.

He said that the cordial talks between the Romanian government delegation and the leaders of the Chinese government were conducted under the guidance of the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The Romanian government delegation's visit to China after the historically significant Moscow meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' parties last November, and the further consolidation and strengthening of the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples, are a new embodiment of the spirit of unity of socialist countries and the international communist movement as reflected in the Moscow meeting. The fraternal relations between the Chinese and Romanian peoples will surely be further consolidated and developed in the future.

Premier Zhou sincerely asked the distinguished guests to convey the friendship and love of the Chinese people to all the Romanian people. He also said that the common cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace will forever link the peoples of our two countries together.

Among those who went to the airport to see them off today were Vice Premiers He Long and Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Peng Zhen, and Cheng Qian of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman Zhang Zhizhong of the National Defense Council, Vice Chairman Bao Erhan of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, heads of various departments of the Chinese government, people's organizations, and democratic parties, as well as diplomatic envoys of various countries to China.

At 9:00 AM, Premier Zhou Enlai and others accompanied the distinguished guests to the front of the plane and warmly shook hands with them to bid farewell. At this time, Chairman Chivu Stoica said to Premier Zhou, "The Romanian people are eagerly awaiting your visit." Premier Zhou replied that he would definitely visit Romania.

Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, China's Ambassador to Romania Ke Bonian, and Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yu Peiwen accompanied the distinguished guests on their visit to Northeast China. As the special plane carrying the distinguished guests slowly took off, the well-wishers continued to wave to the sky for a long time, wishing them a safe journey.

    罗政府代表团离京
    在东北参观后将去朝鲜访问
    新华社8日讯　以基伏·斯托伊卡主席为首的罗马尼亚政府代表团今天乘专机离开北京前往东北。贵宾们将在鞍山和沈阳等地参观访问后去朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行友好访问。
    早晨八时半，新建的首都机场上奏起罗中两国国歌。基伏·斯托伊卡主席由周恩来总理陪同检阅了仪仗队。首都女青年向贵宾们献了鲜花。
    基伏·斯托伊卡主席向首都人民发表了热情的告别讲话。他在讲话中再次强调指出，昨天签字的罗中两国政府的联合声明，表明了“两国政府和两国人民决心发展和加深本着社会主义国际主义精神的兄弟友谊和多方面的合作关系，决心不断加强各国人民和平和安全的主要保证，即以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致。联合声明同时也反映了我们两国对与所有不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策，以及对缓和国际紧张局势和保卫和平事业的坚决拥护。”
    他还说：“中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明而久经考验的领导之下，在把中国变成为社会主义工业强国的事业中获得了辉煌成就。你们的成就就是我们的成就，是整个社会主义阵营以及和平和进步的一切力量的胜利。”
    基伏·斯托伊卡主席代表罗马尼亚人民热情祝贺中国人民在社会主义建设和保卫和平的事业中不断获得新的胜利，并且表示要把中国人民的友情转达给罗马尼亚人民。
    在基伏·斯托伊卡主席讲话前，周恩来总理代表中国政府和人民致词欢送贵宾，对他们为进一步加强中罗人民兄弟友谊作出的巨大贡献表示最诚挚的谢意。
    他说，罗马尼亚政府代表团同中国政府领导人的亲切会谈，是在马克思列宁主义原则和无产阶级国际主义精神的指导下进行的。罗马尼亚政府代表团在各国共产党和工人党的代表在去年11月具有历史意义的莫斯科会议之后前来中国访问，他们的访问和中罗两国人民兄弟友谊的进一步巩固和加强，正是莫斯科会议关于社会主义各国和国际共产主义的团结精神的新的体现。中罗两国人民的兄弟关系今后一定会得到更大的巩固和发展。
    周总理衷心地请贵宾们把中国人民的友情和热爱转达给全体罗马尼亚人民，他还说，建设社会主义和维护世界和平的共同事业将把我们两国人民永远地联结在一起。
    今天前往机场送行的，还有贺龙、陈毅副总理，李济深、郭沫若、彭真、程潜副委员长，国防委员会副主席张治中，政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，外交部副部长罗贵波，我国政府各部门、各人民团体和民主党派的负责人，以及各国驻华使节。
    九时正，周恩来总理等一直把贵宾送到飞机前面，同他们热烈握手道别。这时，基伏·斯托伊卡主席对周总理说，“罗马尼亚人民热烈期待着您的光临”，周总理回答说他一定要到罗马尼亚访问。
    外交部副部长曾涌泉、我国驻罗马尼亚大使柯柏年和外交部礼宾司司长俞沛文等陪同贵宾前往东北参观访问。当贵宾们乘坐的专机徐徐起飞时，欢送的人们仍久久地向空中挥手致意，遥祝他们一路平安。（附图片）
