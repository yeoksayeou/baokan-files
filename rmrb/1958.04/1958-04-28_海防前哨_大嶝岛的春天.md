    The Spring of Dadeng Island: A Coastal Defense Outpost
    Sun Dexian

    One afternoon in late March, amidst the rumbling of artillery fire, we crossed the strait to Dadeng Island and arrived at Dadeng Island, the most forward coastal defense outpost in southeastern China. This area was originally a district of Jinmen County but is now temporarily under the jurisdiction of Nan'an County, Fujian Province. It is separated from Jinmen Island, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, by only a narrow strip of water, the closest point being only 1,800 meters and the furthest just over 4,000 meters.

    When I set foot on this island, everything I saw was truly beyond my expectations: it was a scene of prosperity everywhere. Fields of lush green wheat seedlings rippled constantly in the warm spring breeze. Soybeans intercropped in the winter sweet potato fields had already sprouted tender leaflets. Fresh, tender green vegetable seedlings were visible everywhere.

    The island's postman led me to the Dadeng District Committee. District Committee Secretary Zhang Youcai, a tall middle-aged man, gave me a brief introduction to the farmers' production and living conditions in his Shandong accent. He said that before liberation, the island's farmers were exploited by the Kuomintang bandits. They could not get enough to eat from farming or enough to wear from growing cotton, and large numbers of people fled to the mainland in search of food every year. After liberation, especially after the establishment of the four agricultural cooperatives, farmers were not only well-fed and clothed, but also had surpluses every year. He said that Dengxing Cooperative alone had accumulated more than 50,000 yuan in public accumulation funds in just two years since its establishment.

    Then, when Zhang Youcai talked about the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen Island frequently shelling the area, he led me outside and pointed to the mountains in front of us, telling me: that is Jinmen Island, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. He said that on clear days, people only need to stand on high ground in front of the village to see the Chiang Kai-shek troops' jeeps scurrying around Jinmen Island like rats crossing the street.

    Afterwards, we went along the communication trench to ×× village. When I walked into this village, I saw farm women sitting under the eaves selecting seeds, and children playing in front of the houses. In a nearby handicraft workshop, members were busily repairing various farm tools for the farmers. In the supply and marketing cooperative and the food store, people were selecting their favorite production and living materials. Anyone who has not been here would never imagine that the people living on the coastal defense outpost island live like this.

    Although they are subjected to shelling by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen Island day and night, the farmers still go to the fields to produce and cultivate in a timely manner every day.

    One day in March last year, members of the Nanxing Agricultural Cooperative in Yangtang Village were planting peanuts at the foot of Qizai Mountain when the artillery of the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen Island suddenly roared towards this peanut field. Shells exploded in the peanut field, but after the shelling stopped, the members immediately crawled out of the bomb shelters and replanted more than one mu of peanuts that had been damaged by the shelling.

    Shell fragments are good materials for making farm tools. After each shelling by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, the farmers collect all the shell fragments that hit the ground. According to Director Cai of the Dadeng Supply and Marketing Cooperative, from November last year to March 10 this year, the farmers collected more than 43,300 jin of shell fragments from the fields and sold them to the supply and marketing cooperative, worth more than 5,800 yuan. The third production team of Dengxing Cooperative recently collected shell fragments in two months and exchanged them for two ox carts and one waterwheel from the supply and marketing cooperative. The members told me with a smile: in recent years, most of the farm tools we use were sent by the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen Island.

    Dadeng Island has more than 5,700 mu of land, but most of it is dry land. In order to eliminate the phenomenon of nine droughts in ten years, the whole island launched a mass water conservancy construction movement in January this year. They used shell craters to build ponds and wells. By the end of March, they had newly built and renovated 206 ponds, more than 1,580 wells, and 30 ditches. Now the whole island has an average of one pond and seven wells for every 28 mu of land.

    At the same time, a large-scale manure accumulation campaign was launched throughout the island. In just over two months, the farmers accumulated more than 1.67 million dan of sea mud and soil wall mud.

    Due to the large-scale water conservancy construction on the island this year, the planting area of ​​various crops this year will be greatly expanded compared with last year. District Committee Secretary Zhang Youcai told me that this year, in addition to changing the more than 1,200 mu of winter sweet potatoes that are harvested once a year on the island to two crops a year, they will also expand the planting area of ​​sweet potatoes (the local staple food) from more than 1,100 mu last year to more than 3,800 mu this year. The area of ​​peanuts and sorghum will also be greatly expanded compared with last year, and all will be planted using triangular dense planting. The yield of various crops will also be doubled.

    The People's Liberation Army guarding here is very enthusiastic about supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production. In addition to donating more than 600 yuan to the agricultural cooperative to purchase stone and cement to support water conservancy construction, they also help farmers repair water conservancy and accumulate fertilizer. Whenever the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen Island shell the area, the PLA soldiers guarding here launch fierce counterattacks until the Chiang Kai-shek troops' artillery is silenced. Therefore, the farmers are very grateful to the PLA. They say: the PLA comrades not only protect our production day and night, but also come to support our production. They are truly good soldiers of the people! (Attached picture)

    海防前哨——大嶝岛的春天
    孙德籼
    3月下旬某一天的下午，在隆隆的炮声中，我们渡过了去大嶝岛的海峡，来到了祖国东南海防最前哨的大嶝岛。这里原是金门县的一个区，现在暂归福建省南安县管辖，和蒋军盘踞的金门岛只一水之隔，近的相距仅一千八百公尺，远的也只有四千多公尺。
    当我踏上这个海岛的时候，我所见到的一切，真是出乎我意料之外：这里到处呈现着一片繁荣的景象。一片片绿油油的麦苗，随着暖和的春风，不断地在起伏着。间种在冬番薯地里的大豆已长出瓣瓣的嫩叶。又绿又嫩的青菜苗到处可见。
    岛上的邮递员同志，领着我来到了大嶝区委会。区委书记张友才是个身材很高的中年人，他操着山东口音向我简要地介绍了岛上农民生产、生活的情况。他说，解放前，岛上农民由于受到国民党匪帮的压榨，种田吃不饱，种棉穿不暖，年年都有大批人往陆上逃荒。解放后，特别是办起四个农业社以后，农民不但丰衣足食，而且年年还有积余。他说，光是嶝星一个社，办社到现在仅二年，就积了公积金五万多元。
    接着，张友才在谈到金门岛上蒋军经常炮击这里时，他领着我走出屋外，指着前面的山头告诉我：这就是蒋军盘踞的金门岛。他说，在天气静朗的日子，人们只要站在村前的高处，就能见到金门岛上蒋军的吉普车，像老鼠过街似的乱窜。
    随后，我们沿着交通沟来到了××村。当我走进这个村庄时，就见到农妇们坐在屋檐下选种子，孩子们在屋前作游戏；附近一个手工业工场，社员们正忙碌地为农民修补各种农具；在供销社和食品商店里，人们正在挑选自己喜爱的生产和生活资料。没到过这里的人，谁能想到居住在海防前哨海岛的人们，是这样生活着。
    这里虽然日日夜夜遭受金门岛上蒋军的炮击，但是农民们仍天天下田生产，及时耕种。
    去年3月间的某一天，杨塘村南星农业社的社员们，正在齐仔山下种花生，这时金门岛上蒋军的炮口，突然对着这片花生地怒吼起来，炮弹落在花生地里爆炸了，但是社员们在炮声停息后，立即从避炮沟里钻出来，把一亩多被炮火打坏的花生，马上补种起来。
    炮弹片是打农具的好材料，在每次蒋军炮击停止后，农民们就把打在地里的炮弹片全部拾回来。据大嶝供销社蔡主任告诉我：从去年11月到今年3月10日，农民从地里拾回卖给供销社的炮弹片，就有四万三千三百多斤，价值五千八百多元。嶝星社第三生产队，在最近二个月中拾得的弹片，就向供销社换回牛车二部，水车一部。社员们笑着告诉我：几年来，我们用的农具，大部分是金门岛上蒋军送来的。
    大嶝岛共有五千七百多亩土地，但绝大部分是旱地。为了消灭十年九旱的现象，今年1月，全岛掀起了一个群众性的兴修水利运动，他们利用炮弹坑兴修池塘和水井。到3月底，他们就新修和改修了池塘二百零六处，水井一千五百八十多处，水沟三十条。现在全岛平均二十八亩土地，就有一个池塘、七个水井。
    与此同时，全岛还开展了大规模的积肥运动，仅二个多月中，农民就积了海泥、土墙泥一百六十七万多担。
    由于今年岛上兴修了大规模水利建设，今年各种农作物的种植面积都将比去年大大扩大。区委书记张友才告诉我，今年区里除把岛上一年一熟的一千二百多亩冬番薯改为一年早晚两熟外，还把今年番薯（当地主要食粮）的种植面积由去年一千一百多亩，扩大到三千八百多亩。花生、高粱面积也将比去年扩大很多，并将全部实行三角密植，各种农作物产量也要翻一翻。
    守卫在这里的人民解放军对支援农业生产大跃进情绪很高，他们除捐献六百多元给农业社购买石料、水泥支援水利建设外，还帮助农民修水利、积肥。每当金门岛上蒋军炮击这里的时候，守卫在这里的解放军战士都给予猛烈的还击，一直把蒋军的大炮打得像个哑巴为止，因此农民都非常感谢解放军。他们说：解放军同志不仅日日夜夜保护我们生产，而且还来支援我们生产，真不愧是人民的好战士！（附图片）
