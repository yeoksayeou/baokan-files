Thousands of students at Berlin University held a rally on April 1st to welcome the new Soviet initiative.
Korea
    Pyongyang newspapers published editorials on April 2nd, warmly welcoming the Soviet decision to halt the testing of atomic weapons.

Vietnam
    The "People's Daily" published an editorial on April 2nd stating that the Soviet Union's unilateral decision to halt nuclear weapons testing is an important initiative for defending world peace. It stated that the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warmly support this great Soviet initiative.
    The editorial pointed out that the United States and Britain's testing of atomic weapons in the Pacific seriously threatens the lives and tranquility of the Asian people.
India
    An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman, commenting on the Soviet decision to halt nuclear weapons testing, said: "This is exactly what we have been calling for loudly to the world in the past. We are, of course, happy about this decision."
    Segal, a member of the Central State Assembly, said: "This is a courageous step taken by the Soviet Union. Now we want to see if the United States and the United Kingdom will take the same step; they must do so."

Indonesia

    The newspaper said that it is now up to the Western countries, especially the United States, to express their attitude. If they really do not intend to push mankind into the abyss of disaster, they should follow the pace of the Soviet Union. Otherwise, their attitude is provocative and aggressive.

It will give new strength to the world movement calling for a complete ban on nuclear weapons.

    The "Manchester Guardian" said in an editorial that Western countries have no other choice but to respond to the Soviet proposals.

    The French "L'Humanité" published an article by Étienne Fajon, a member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party Central Committee. The article said that the Soviet resolution "panics those who threaten humanity with disaster, and fills the people of all countries with gratitude and hope." (Xinhua News Agency)
