Active Rural Cultural Life Promotes Production
Tianmen County Clubs Spread Throughout Rural Areas

(Reported by our correspondents Tian Zhuang and Luo Chongzhang) Clubs in Tianmen County, Hubei Province, are now prevalent throughout the countryside. Many townships have achieved "a club in every commune, a troupe in every club." This has played a significant role in invigorating rural cultural life.

The establishment of rural clubs in Tianmen County began in 1954. With the increasing improvement of people's lives after agricultural cooperation, the demand for cultural activities has become more and more urgent. Therefore, the Tianmen County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has always attached great importance to the work of clubs. In January of this year, in order to promote the experience of Xiaomiao Township's club work, they organized more than 1,000 people, including party secretaries, cultural cadres, and key members of clubs from various townships and communes, to hold an on-site meeting in Xiaomiao Township, which greatly promoted the development of club work. According to statistics, as of now, the number of clubs in the county has increased from 504 last year to 624, and the number of amateur theatrical troupes has also increased from the original 369 to 406.

After the clubs were established, the biggest difficulty encountered was the lack of talent in directing, music, and art. In order to solve this contradiction, the county has held many training courses in music, directing, and art, concentrating on training more than 2,000 key members of the clubs last year alone. At the same time, the county's cultural departments also regularly send cadres to rural areas to carry out amateur training work. From the second half of last year to the present, they have trained more than 350 directors and actors. In Henglin Township, where no one knew how to perform new-style opera before, many people are now able to perform "Sisters-in-Law Picking Tea," "Going to the Countryside," "Happy Event at Dusk," and a variety of other literary and artistic programs with relative proficiency.

Regularly organizing observation and performance meetings has become one of the important tasks for Tianmen County to consolidate and improve clubs. The advantage of observation and performance meetings is that they not only exchange activity experiences in a timely manner, but also invigorate mass cultural life. Xiaomiao Township's club performances have formed a system: small performances are held every seven days in the team, large performances are held every half month in the commune, and association performances are held every month in the township. Bashi, Zhanggang, Zaoshi and other districts generally hold one to two association performances per month. In February of this year, the county held a county-wide grand association performance. More than 80 outstanding clubs performed more than 90 programs in this association performance. Among them, "Free Drumming" and "Going to People's School" were warmly welcomed by the masses.

In order to open up sources of singing materials, the county's cultural departments have also helped clubs establish amateur literary and artistic creation groups. These creation groups closely cooperate with the central task, adopting the approach of "collecting materials locally, creating what is done, composing what is done, and singing what is done." In terms of content, they generally "focus on production, focus on thought, and focus on typical examples." In this way, the content of the performances is more closely related to reality, making them intimate and moving to the audience.

At present, the quality of some clubs is not high, and the content of activities is poor. The county is further strengthening its leadership over the work of clubs to consolidate and improve them.

### 活跃农村文化生活推动生产  天门县俱乐部遍布农村

    活跃农村文化生活推动生产
    天门县俱乐部遍布农村
    本报讯　记者田庄、罗重璋报道：湖北省天门县俱乐部遍布农村。许多乡已经做到了“社社建部，部部有团”。这对活跃农村文化生活起了重大作用。
    天门县的农村俱乐部是从1954年开始建立的。农业合作化以后，群众生活一天比一天提高，对文化生活的要求也一天比一天迫切。因此，中共天门县委一直对俱乐部的工作十分重视。今年1月间，为了推广小庙乡俱乐部工作的经验，又组织了各乡、社党的书记、文化干部以及俱乐部主要成员一千多人，到小庙乡召开现场会议，这大大推动了俱乐部工作的发展。据统计，截至目前止，全县的俱乐部已从去年的五百零四个增加到六百二十四个，业余剧团也从原来的三百六十九个发展到四百零六个。
    俱乐部建立以后，碰到的最大困难，是缺乏导演、音乐和美术方面的人才。为了解决这一矛盾，这个县曾举办了多次音乐、导演和美术方面的训练班，仅去年就分批集中培养了俱乐部的骨干两千多人。同时，该县文化部门还经常派干部到农村开展业余训练工作，从去年下半年起到现在，先后培养了导演和演员三百五十多人。横林乡原来没人会演新型歌剧，现在许多人已经能够比较熟练地演出“姑嫂采茶”、“下乡”、“黄昏喜事”等戏和多种多样的文艺节目。
    经常地组织观摩会演，已经成为天门县巩固与提高俱乐部的重要工作之一。观摩会演的好处，不仅及时交流了活动经验，而且活跃了群众文化生活。小庙乡俱乐部会演已经形成制度：队里七天一小演，社里半月一大演，乡里一月一会演。耙市、张港、皂市等区，一般都是每月会演一次到两次。今年2月份，这个县举行了一次全县性的大会演。八十多个优秀的俱乐部，在这次会演中演出了九十多个节目。其中“自由锣鼓”、“上民校”等，都受到了群众热烈欢迎。
    为了开辟演唱材料的来源，这个县文化部门还帮助俱乐部建立了业余文艺创作小组。这些创作小组密切配合中心工作，采取“就地取材，做什么，编什么，唱什么”，在内容上一般都是“抓生产、抓思想、抓典型”。这样，演唱的内容就更结合实际，使人看了亲切动人。
    目前，有些俱乐部的质量还不高，活动内容贫乏，该县正进一步加强对俱乐部工作的领导，使之巩固提高。
