Rural Amateur Culture Will Flourish

(Our Dispatch) The slogan for the leap forward in cultural centers everywhere is, "Rally revolutionary spirit to bring about a new situation in rural mass amateur cultural work, where 'poetry, books, opera, and music are everywhere, and literary and artistic flowers bloom all over the mountains and villages.'"

Recently, the Qimen County Cultural Center and the Likou Cultural Center branch in Anhui Province specifically convened a five-day meeting to discuss the specific tasks of serving the county in achieving 800 catties this year, and focused on examining and criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking of cadres who thought there were too few people, too little money, and too many difficulties. The meeting decided to "plant the flag of clubs all over the mountainous areas" and to send six-fifths of the workforce to the countryside for in-depth guidance.

The cultural centers of Feidong in Anhui, Changling in Jilin, and Yixing in Jiangsu have all formulated plans for 1958 based on the specific conditions of their regions. They have also put forward specific measures to ensure the realization of the planned targets. Feidong County has formed a mass cultural work guidance committee composed of relevant units such as the County Party Committee Propaganda Department, the Agriculture Department, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the Bureau of Culture and Education, and the Literacy Campaign, to ensure that every township has a guidance station, every commune has a guidance group, and every team has a guidance counselor. At the same time, training courses will be used to cultivate 80,000 to 100,000 backbone members of mass amateur cultural activities, carry out appraisal activities, and cultivate cultural advanced districts, advanced townships, and advanced communes.

Many cultural centers have also launched leap-forward initiatives to fraternal centers, launching friendly competitions. The Lin County Cultural Center issued a proposal to cultural centers throughout the province to "compare indicators, compare quality, compare diligence and thrift, and compare learning." The Fuxian County Cultural Center proposed "four goods" to cultural centers throughout the province, namely, good publicity, good service, good hygiene, and good physical exercise; and "five comparisons," namely, comparing enthusiasm, comparing hardship, comparing labor, comparing work, and comparing learning. The Fengzhen County Cultural Center also launched a general mobilization to rural clubs and art enthusiasts throughout the county, mobilizing all literary and artistic propaganda forces to carry out the socialist propaganda movement and serve the completion and overfulfillment of production and construction.

    农村业余文化将百花齐放
    本报讯　“鼓起革命干劲，使农村群众业余文化工作，出现一个‘诗书戏乐到处有，文艺花开遍山村’的新局面。”这是各地文化馆的跃进口号。
    最近，安徽省祁门县文化馆和历口文化馆分馆就专门召开了五天会议，讨论了为今年实现八百斤县服务的具体任务，并着重检查、批判了干部思想上的人少、钱少、困难多的右倾保守思想。会议决定“把俱乐部的旗帜插遍山区”，并拿出六分之五的人力下农村深入辅导。
    安徽的肥东、吉林的长岭、江苏宜兴等县的文化馆都根据本地区的具体情况，制订了1958年的规划。并提出了保证实现规划指标的具体措施。肥东县由县委宣传部、农业部、共青团、妇联、文教局、利普等有关单位组成群众文化工作指导委员会，做到乡乡有辅导站，社社有辅导组，队队有辅导员。同时通过训练班培养八万至十万群众业余文化活动的骨干分子，开展评比运动，培选文化先进区、先进乡、先进社等。
    许多文化馆还向兄弟馆发起了跃进倡议，展开友谊竞赛。林县文化馆向全省文化馆发出了“比指标、比质量、比勤俭、比学习”的倡议书。复县文化馆向全省文化馆提出“四好”，即宣传好、服务好、卫生好、身体锻炼好；和“五比”，即比干劲、比艰苦、比劳动、比工作、比学习。丰镇县文化馆还向全县农村俱乐部和文艺爱好者发出了总动员，动员所有文艺宣传力量，开展社会主义宣传运动，为完成和超额完成生产建设服务。
