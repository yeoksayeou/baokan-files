This newspaper reports from Taiyuan: Shanxi Province has recently decided on a plan to increase oil crop production by appropriately expanding planting areas, changing the practice of planting on bare land to universal fertilization, replacing inferior seeds with superior seeds, and changing sparse planting to dense planting to ensure a large-scale bumper harvest of oil crops.

This year, in addition to fully utilizing saline-alkali wasteland and field edges to expand the planting area of oil crops, Shanxi will focus on cultivating 2.26 million mu of high-quality oil crop land, requiring a fertilization rate of 2,000 to 4,000 jin per mu. Organic fertilizers will be added to saline-alkali land, and the past rough farming habits will be changed to universal fine harrowing to conserve moisture. Terraces will be built on slopes, and the land will be leveled to conserve water, fertilizer, and topsoil. Drainage will be carried out in low-lying areas to wash away alkali, sand will be laid for sowing to ensure full seedling emergence. In the Yanbei and Xin County areas, which are rich in flax, the farming habit of not cultivating and weeding will be changed. The planting area of the excellent varieties "Yannong No. 1" and "Shangyi Big Peach Flax" will be expanded to more than 120,000 mu. Superior sunflower varieties such as "Prairie People" and "Hungarian No. 4" will also be actively promoted. After all the above technical measures are fully implemented, the province's more than 2 million mu of oil crops are expected to achieve an average yield of 66 jin per mu, an increase of 59% compared to last year, and the total output will reach more than 150 million jin, exceeding any previous year. In addition, the masses will be mobilized to use idle land such as field corners and in front of houses to plant ten sunflower plants per person, and sunflowers will be planted on 1.17 million mu of saline-alkali land. This alone will increase the production of sunflower seeds by more than 117 million jin.

Currently, oil crop sowing has begun successively from south to north throughout the province.

During the first Five-Year Plan period, Shanxi Province neglected the management of oil crops, resulting in rough farming, lack of fertilizer and water, and poor variety improvement, so the yield was relatively low. The average yield of oil crops per mu in the province remained at around 50 jin for a long time. However, at the same time, many high-yield models appeared in various areas such as saline-alkali depressions, slopes, and field corners. For example, the 1,200 mu of sunflower in saline-alkali land of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Dingxiang County produced an average of more than 115 jin per mu, nearly twice as much as the average yield of 41 jin per mu for the province's 2.15 million mu of oil crops last year. There are also a large number of high-yield cases of peanuts and flax. This proves that the potential for increasing oil crop production this year is very large. (Wu Zanting)

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, April 13th: Hebei Province is actively tapping the potential of oil production this year to increase oil output. The methods adopted by various regions are: focusing on technology to increase the unit yield of planned planting areas; focusing on idle land and woody oil crops in mountainous areas to utilize all available land. As a result, it is estimated that this year's oil production will increase at least twice as much as last year.

This year, the province plans to plant more than 6.47 million mu of oil crops such as peanuts, sesame, castor beans, and sunflowers. Although the area has not increased much compared with last year (0.23%), technical measures for planting have been strengthened. In the past, fields had no water for irrigation, but this year there is water for irrigation; in the past, less fertilizer was applied, but this year more fertilizer is applied; in the past, sowing was sparse, but this year it is dense; in the past, there were fewer high-yield fields, but this year, every commune is creating large-scale high-yield oil crop fields. At present, agricultural cooperatives in various oil-producing areas have prepared seeds and are carrying out appraisals and leveling land. To ensure increased oil production, from the prefectural committee to the township party committee, a secretary is assigned to personally lead this production.

Compared with last year, the more than 300 million oil trees in the mountainous areas, after strengthening management, are planned to increase oil production by more than 6 million jin. This year, more than 470 million oil trees will be planted in the mountainous areas, and about half have already been planted. Within three years, the province plans to plant more than 940 million oil trees in the mountainous areas. In this way, the mountainous areas of Hebei can be transformed into an important oil base.

### 山西河北全面挖掘潜力推广先进技术  促进油料作物大面积增产

    山西河北全面挖掘潜力推广先进技术
    促进油料作物大面积增产
    本报太原电　适当扩大种植面积，变白茬下种为普遍施肥，变劣种为优种，变稀植为密植，以保证油料作物大面积丰收，这是山西省最近决定的增产油料方案。
    今年，山西各地除充分利用盐碱荒地和地边扩大种植油料作物面积外，将着重培植二百二十六万亩好地油料作物，要求每亩施肥量达到二千斤至四千斤。在盐碱地里增施有机质肥料，改变过去耕作粗放习惯，普遍细耙保墒。在山坡地里培地埂，平整田面，以保水、保肥、保表土。在低洼地里排水洗碱，铺沙播种，保证全苗。在盛产葫麻的雁北、忻县地区，改变不中耕锄草的耕作习惯。优良品种“雁农一号”、“尚义大桃葫麻”种植面积将扩大到十二万多亩。“草原人”、“匈牙利四号”等向日葵优种也要积极推广。上述各项技术措施全部实现后，全省二百多万亩油料作物，预计每亩平均产量可达六十六斤，比去年提高59％，总产量将达到一亿五千多万斤，超过以往任何一年。另外，还要发动群众利用地头屋前等空闲土地，每人种十株向日葵，并在一百十七万亩盐碱地里种植向日葵。仅这一项，即可增产葵花籽一亿一千七百多万斤。
    现在，全省从南向北已陆续开始油料作物播种。
    山西省在第一个五年计划期间，由于忽视油料作物管理，耕作粗放，缺肥缺水，品种改良较差，因此产量也较低，全省油料作物每亩平均产量长期停留在五十斤左右。但同时在盐碱洼地、坡地和地头等各类地区却出现了许多高额丰产典型，例如定襄县和平农业社的一千二百多亩盐碱地向日葵，每亩平均产到了一百十五斤多，超过去年全省二百十五万亩油料作物平均亩产四十一斤多的将近两倍。花生、葫麻也有大量高额丰产的事例。这证明了今年油料作物增产的潜力很大。（武赞庭）
    据新华社保定13日电　河北省今年积极挖掘油料生产的潜力，增加油料产量。各地采取的办法是：抓技术，提高计划种植面积的单位产量；抓闲散地和抓山区木本油料，把一切可以利用的土地都利用起来。这样做的结果，预计今年的油料产量至少能比去年增加一倍。
    今年全省计划种植的花生、芝麻、蓖麻子、向日葵等油料作物六百四十七万多亩，面积虽然比去年增加不多（0.23％），但加强了种植的技术措施。过去田里没水灌浇，今年有水灌浇；过去施肥少，今年施肥多；过去是稀播，今年为密植；过去丰产田较少，今年社社搞大面积油料丰产田。目前，各油料产区的农业社，已将籽种备齐，正在进行鉴定和平整土地。为了确保油料增产，从地委到乡党委，都有一个书记分工亲自领导这项生产。
    和去年比较，山区的三亿多棵油料树，经过加强管理，计划可增产油料六百多万斤。今年山区将增种油料树四亿七千多万棵，现在已种了一半左右。在三年内，全省山区计划种植的油料树将超过九亿四千余万棵。这样，河北的山区就可以变成一个重要的油料基地。
