Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 6th: Sichuan Province is vigorously promoting four major technical measures to ensure increased double-cropping rice production. These four major technical measures are: early sowing and planting, dense planting, rational fertilization, and thorough pest control.

This year, the early rice sowing time throughout the province has been generally advanced by more than half a month to a month compared to last year. Last year, sowing did not begin until around the Qingming Festival, but this year, transplanting has begun in most areas before Qingming. Dense planting in various areas is generally around five inches apart, with many areas reaching three inches; sufficient base fertilizer is applied, and rice stem borer control during the winter is well done. The promotion of other techniques (such as seed selection, seed dressing, and seed soaking) is also more widespread than in the past.

Changing the cultivation system and increasing the multiple cropping index is one of the main measures for increasing production in Sichuan Province this year. In addition to widely increasing intercropping, relay planting, and interplanting, expanding the area of double-cropping rice is the central link in implementing this measure. The planned area for double-cropping rice in the province this year will be expanded from over 8 million mu last year to over 15 million mu. This measure alone is expected to increase grain production by over 1 billion jin, accounting for one-third of the province's total grain increase of over 3 billion jin this year.

At the beginning of spring plowing this year, under the slogan of "seizing the season and grabbing time," experimental fields in various parts of Sichuan Province first set an example. In many places, Communist Party committee leaders took off their shoes and went into the fields before the Spring Festival to lead the sowing. Luzhou, Nanchong, and other special districts organized demonstration transplanting at all levels, from the county to the township. Agricultural technology training classes, farmer technology night schools, and various technical teaching activities held in various places are all centered on the implementation of these four major measures. Combined with these activities, advanced examples have been vigorously publicized, conservative ideas have been criticized, and methods have been introduced through visits, evaluations, and exchange of experiences. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses have brought into play unparalleled enthusiasm and created endless methods. For example, in order to strive for early transplanting, farmers in Yibin, Zizhong, Nanbu, Luzhou and other places have successively created nearly ten kinds of rapid seedling raising methods, the fastest of which can be transplanted three days after sowing. For dense planting, many tools such as seedling transplanters and row markers created in various places not only ensured quality but also improved efficiency.

### 早播早栽、密植、合理施肥、防治虫害  四川推行四大增产措施

    早播早栽、密植、合理施肥、防治虫害
    四川推行四大增产措施
    新华社成都6日电　四川省各地正在大力推行四大技术措施，保证双季稻增产。这四大技术措施是：早播早栽、密植、合理施肥和彻底防治虫害。
    今年全省早稻播种时间普遍比去年提早了半个多月到一个月。去年清明才播种，今年大部地区未到清明就开始栽秧。各地密植一般都在五寸上下，许多地区达到三寸；底肥上的足，冬季治螟做的好。其他技术（如选种、拌种、浸种等）的推广也比过去普遍。
    改变耕作制度、提高复种指数是四川省今年增产的主要措施之一。除了广泛增种、套种、间种外，扩大双季稻面积是贯彻这一措施的中心环节。全省今年双季稻面积计划从去年的八百多万亩扩大到一千五百万亩以上。仅这一项措施，预计就可以增产粮食十亿斤以上，占全省今年增产粮食三十多亿斤的三分之一。
    今年春耕一开始，四川省各地在“抢季节、抓时间”的口号下，各地试验田首先做出榜样，许多地方中共党委负责人还在春节前就脱鞋下田，带头播种。沪州、南充等专区从县到乡都层层组织了示范栽秧。各地举办的农业技术训练班、农民技术夜校和多种多样的技术传授活动，都以贯彻这四大措施为中心。结合这些活动，通过参观、评比、交流经验，大力宣传了先进事例，批判了保守思想，介绍了办法。广大群众在党的领导下，发挥了无比的干劲，创造层出不尽。例如，为了争取早栽，宜宾、资中、南部、沪州等地农民先后创造了近十种快速育秧法，其中最快的播种后三天就可以栽插。为了密植，各地创造的栽秧尺、划行器等许多工具，不但保证了质量，而且提高了效率。
