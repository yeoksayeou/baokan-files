Xinhua News Agency, April 8th. Joint Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Romanian People's Republic

At the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, the delegation of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic, headed by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic, Chivu Stoica, paid a friendly visit to China from March 31st to April 10th, 1958.

The delegation of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic visited cities such as Kunming, Xi'an, Beijing, and Wuhan, and toured factories, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and scenic spots. They will also visit cities such as Anshan and Shenyang. The delegation of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people wherever they went, which powerfully demonstrates the profound friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Romania.

During the visit, Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China received the delegation of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic.

During the visit, leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China held talks with the delegation of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic.

The Chinese side participating in the talks included: Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Li Zheren, and Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Romanian People's Republic Ke Bonian.

The Romanian side participating in the talks included: Chairman of the Council of Ministers Chivu Stoica, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Transportation and Post and Telecommunications Emil Bodnăraş, Minister of Foreign Affairs Avram Bunaciu, and Ambassador of the Romanian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China Teodor Rudenco.

The talks were conducted in a sincere and friendly atmosphere. During the talks, the two sides exchanged views on the current international situation, further strengthening the solidarity of socialist countries, and developing friendly cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic.

During the talks, the two sides reached a complete consensus on the issues discussed.

The two governments noted with satisfaction that the development of the international situation in the past year has proved that the forces for maintaining peace in the world have become stronger and the conditions for striving for lasting world peace are more favorable. Although imperialist war forces are still trying every possible means to create tension, as long as all peace-loving countries and peoples continue to strengthen unity and persist in struggle, the imperialist policy of war threats and the conspiracy to create new wars will be difficult to succeed. Based on this conviction, the two governments reiterated their determination to continue to wage unremitting struggles with all peace-loving countries and peoples for the noble cause of maintaining world peace.

In the current international life, the Soviet government's proposal for holding a summit conference has received increasing support from countries and has deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, becoming a universal demand of hundreds of millions of people. The two governments reiterate their full support for this reasonable proposal by the Soviet government. Both sides warmly welcome and support the Soviet Union's unilateral decision to stop nuclear weapons testing. The two governments believe that this major measure has opened the way for the complete cessation of nuclear weapons testing by relevant countries, and the United States and Britain should take the same measures immediately.

The two sides reiterated the following positions: Military blocs in Europe and Asia should be abolished and replaced by collective security systems; military bases established on the territory of other countries should be abolished; troops stationed on the territory of other countries should be withdrawn.

Recently, West Germany has been stepping up its rearmament, and has decided to equip its army with nuclear weapons and prepare to establish American missile bases within its territory. All these activities threaten the peace and security of Europe, and are also a serious obstacle to the German people's struggle for peaceful reunification. Both sides condemned the adventurous policy of the American aggressive bloc attempting to push West Germany onto the road of preparing for nuclear war. The two sides support the German Democratic Republic's continuous efforts for the peaceful reunification of Germany, and believe that the methods repeatedly proposed by the government of the German Democratic Republic to promote mutual understanding and rapprochement between the two existing Germanys are the only realistic ways to achieve German reunification under the present circumstances.

The two governments reiterate their full support for the proposal of the Government of the Polish People's Republic to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The Chinese government once again expresses its complete agreement with the initiative of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic to convene a summit conference of Balkan countries and to sign a common agreement guaranteeing the peace and the progress and prosperity of the peoples of the Balkan region. If these proposals can be realized, they will undoubtedly have extremely important significance for maintaining peace in Europe and the world.

A major feature of the current international situation is the unprecedented upsurge of the Asian and African people's movements against colonialism and for national independence. Both sides firmly support the heroic struggles of the Indonesian people to safeguard national sovereignty and oppose foreign subversion, and of the Algerian people to strive for national independence. Both sides reiterate their full support for the just cause of the Asian and African people to strive for and safeguard national sovereignty and independence, and to oppose colonialism, and condemn the imperialist aggressive blocs' conspiracy activities to continue aggression through the Baghdad Pact and the Manila Treaty.

The two governments fully support the reasonable proposal put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5, 1958, regarding the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The Government of the Romanian People's Republic warmly welcomes the Chinese People's Volunteers' decision to completely withdraw from Korea before the end of 1958, and believes that this measure is an important contribution to easing tensions in the Far East and the world. Both sides believe that the United States and other countries participating in the United Nations forces should also withdraw their troops from Korea without delay.

The two governments fully support the proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 7, 1958, on promoting the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. Both sides condemn the United States' conspiracy to turn South Vietnam into a military base and attempt to drag it into the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Both sides believe that the current state of obstruction and sabotage of the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Vietnam should no longer continue.

Peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems is a basic principle of the two countries' foreign policy. The two governments reiterate that they will continue to develop political, economic, and cultural ties with all countries based on this principle, and make beneficial contributions to promoting international friendly cooperation and maintaining lasting world peace.

Both sides noted with satisfaction that the friendly unity and fraternal cooperation among socialist countries, united by the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the common goal of building socialism and communism, are being consolidated and developed day by day. The brilliant achievements made by socialist countries in socialist and communist construction powerfully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. In November 1957, representatives of communist and workers' parties of various countries held a meeting in Moscow and issued two declarations of great historical significance. All this shows that the unity of socialist countries and the international communist movement have entered a new and higher stage. The two governments emphasize that the solidarity and unity of socialist countries based on the ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism are an important guarantee for the continuous development of the construction cause of all socialist countries and are the decisive factor in maintaining human progress and world peace. The two governments will continue to make unswerving efforts to further strengthen the unity and cooperation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

During the talks, the two sides exchanged views on further strengthening the friendly relations and fraternal cooperation between the two countries. Both sides noted with satisfaction that the friendly cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic are developing smoothly. Facts have proved that this friendly cooperative relationship is very beneficial to the socialist construction cause of the two countries. Both sides will continue to take measures to further develop cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields. In order to further develop trade between the two countries, the two sides plan to hold negotiations on long-term trade agreements in the near future.

Both sides are deeply convinced that the friendly visit of the delegation of the Government of the Romanian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China and the talks between the leaders of the two countries will have a significant impact on further deepening the mutual understanding between the two peoples, promoting friendly cooperation between the two countries, strengthening the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and maintaining the noble cause of world peace and human progress.

Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic Chivu Stoica invited Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai to visit the Romanian People's Republic, and Premier Zhou Enlai has accepted this invitation.

Signed in Beijing, April 7, 1958

    新华社8日讯　中华人民共和国政府罗马尼亚人民共和国政府联合声明
    以罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡为首的罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团应中华人民共和国政府的邀请，于一九五八年三月三十一日至四月十日在中国进行了友好访问。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团访问了昆明、西安、北京、武汉等城市，参观了工厂、农业生产合作社和名胜古迹，并且还将访问鞍山、沈阳等城市。罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团所到之处都受到中国人民的热烈欢迎，这有力地说明了中罗两国人民间的深厚友谊和团结一致。
    在访问期间，中华人民共和国主席毛泽东接见了罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团。
    在访问期间，中华人民共和国政府领导人和罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团进行了会谈。
    中华人民共和国方面参加会谈的有：国务院总理周恩来，副总理兼外交部长陈毅，外交部副部长曾涌泉，对外贸易部副部长李哲人，中华人民共和国驻罗马尼亚人民共和国大使柯柏年。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国方面参加会谈的有：部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡，部长会议副主席兼交通和邮电部长埃米尔·波德纳拉希，外交部长阿夫拉姆·布纳丘，罗马尼亚人民共和国驻中华人民共和国大使特奥多尔·鲁登科。
    会谈是在诚挚和友好的空气中进行的。在会谈中，双方就目前国际形势、进一步加强社会主义国家团结和发展中华人民共和国和罗马尼亚人民共和国之间的友好合作关系等问题交换了意见。
    在会谈中，双方对所讨论的问题取得完全一致的看法。
    两国政府满意地指出，最近一年来国际局势的发展证明，目前世界上维护和平的力量已经更加强大，争取世界持久和平的条件也更加有利，虽然帝国主义战争力量仍然在千方百计地制造紧张局势，但是，只要一切爱好和平的国家和人民不断地加强团结，坚持斗争，帝国主义进行战争威胁的政策和制造新战争的阴谋，就难以得逞。根据这种信念，两国政府重申，决心同一切爱好和平的国家和人民一道，继续为维护世界和平的崇高事业进行不懈的斗争。
    在当前国际生活中，苏联政府提出的关于举行最高级会议的建议得到日益众多的国家的支持，并且已经深入人心，成为亿万人民的普遍要求。两国政府重申，完全支持苏联政府的这项合理建议。双方热烈地欢迎并且支持苏联单方面停止试验核武器的决定。两国政府认为，这一重大措施为有关各国完全停止核武器试验开辟了道路，美国和英国应当立即采取同样的措施。
    双方重申下列主张：在欧洲和亚洲的军事集团应当取消，而代之以集体安全体系；在别国领土上建立的军事基地应当取消；在别国领土上驻扎的军队应当撤出。
    最近一个时期以来，西德正在加紧重整军备，并且决定要用核武器装备它的军队和准备在它的境内设立美国导弹基地。这一切活动威胁着欧洲的和平和安全，同时也是德国人民争取和平统一的严重障碍。双方谴责美国侵略集团企图把西德推向准备核子战争道路上去的冒险政策。双方支持德意志民主共和国为和平统一德国所进行的不断努力，并且认为，德意志民主共和国政府一再提出的促使现存两个德国相互了解和接近的办法，是在目前情况下实现德国统一的唯一现实的办法。
    两国政府重申，完全支持波兰人民共和国政府所提出的在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议。中国政府再一次表示，完全赞同罗马尼亚人民共和国政府提出的关于召开巴尔干国家最高级会议和签订一项保证巴尔干地区的和平和人民的繁荣进步的共同协定的倡议。这些建议如果能够得到实现，无疑地将对维护欧洲和世界和平具有极其重大的意义。
    当前国际形势中的一个主要特点就是亚非人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的运动的空前高涨。双方坚决支持印度尼西亚人民为维护国家主权、反对外来颠覆活动和阿尔及利亚人民为争取民族独立所进行的英勇斗争。双方重申，完全支持亚非人民争取和维护国家主权独立、反对殖民主义的正义事业，并且谴责帝国主义侵略集团通过巴格达条约和马尼拉条约继续进行侵略的阴谋活动。
    两国政府完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在一九五八年二月五日提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题的合理建议。罗马尼亚人民共和国政府对于中国人民志愿军决定在一九五八年年底以前完全撤出朝鲜这一主动措施表示热烈欢迎，并且认为这项措施对于和缓远东和世界紧张局势是一个重要的贡献。双方认为，美国和其他参加联合国军队的国家也应当毫不拖延地从朝鲜撤出他们的军队。
    两国政府完全支持越南民主共和国政府一九五八年三月七日提出的关于促进越南和平统一的建议。双方谴责美国把南越变成一个军事基地并且企图把它拖入侵略性的东南亚集团的阴谋。双方认为，目前日内瓦协议在越南的实施遭到阻挠和破坏的状态不应当再继续下去。
    不同社会制度国家和平共处是两国对外政策的一个基本原则。两国政府重申，将根据这一原则继续同一切国家发展政治、经济和文化联系，为促进国际间的友好合作和维护世界持久和平作出有益的贡献。
    双方满意地指出，以伟大的马克思列宁主义的思想和建设社会主义和共产主义的共同目标所联合起来的社会主义各国间的友好团结和兄弟合作正在一天比一天地巩固和发展。社会主义各国在社会主义和共产主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就，有力地说明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。一九五七年十一月，各国共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科举行了会议，并且发表了具有重大历史意义的两项宣言。这一切都说明社会主义国家间的团结和国际共产主义运动已经进入了一个新的更高的阶段。两国政府强调指出，社会主义国家在马克思列宁主义思想和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的团结一致，是各社会主义国家的建设事业不断发展的重要保证，是维护人类进步和世界和平事业的决定因素。两国政府将继续不断地为进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和合作进行坚持不渝的努力。
    在会谈中，双方就进一步加强两国友好关系和兄弟合作的问题交换了意见。双方满意地注意到，中华人民共和国和罗马尼亚人民共和国之间的友好合作关系正在顺利地发展着。事实证明，这种友好合作关系十分有利于两国社会主义建设事业。双方将继续采取措施以进一步发展两国间的政治、经济和文化方面的合作。双方为进一步发展两国间的贸易，拟于最近时期举行关于长期贸易协定的谈判。
    双方深信，罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团在中华人民共和国进行的友好访问和两国领导人之间的会谈，对进一步加深两国人民的相互了解，促进两国的友好合作，加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，以及对维护世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业都将产生重大的影响。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡邀请了中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来访问罗马尼亚人民共和国，周恩来总理已经接受了这一邀请。
                         一九五八年四月七日于北京
      中华人民共和国国务院总理    周恩来
      罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议主席   基伏·斯托伊卡
