Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 15th: Liu Lianren, a compatriot abducted by Japanese fascists, arrived at Tianjin Xingang this afternoon aboard the Japanese ship "Hakusan Maru," where he received a warm welcome from the people of the motherland.

After enduring fourteen years of hardship, Liu Lianren was extremely moved to return to his homeland today. Before the ship docked, he waved his hat at the welcoming crowd on the shore from the deck, and then raised his hands to applaud. As he disembarked, he was warmly received by Peng Yan and Ni Feijun, Deputy Secretaries-General of the Red Cross Society of China, Ji Feng, Director of the International Liaison Department, and representatives from the Shandong Red Cross Society. At the dock, Liu Lianren reunited with his wife, Zhao Yulan (previously misidentified as Zhou Yulan), fourth younger brother, Liu Liandeng, and son, Liu Huanxin, who had come to greet him with tears in their eyes. Liu Lianren excitedly told reporters, "When I was taken abroad by Japanese militarism, I left crying, but today I return to my motherland smiling. What a great change this is!"

A grand welcome meeting was held for Liu Lianren at the Xingang Seamen's Club Square, not far from the dock. A colorful archway at the entrance of the venue was inscribed with the golden characters "Welcome Compatriot Liu Lianren Back to the Motherland." Countless colorful flags fluttered in the wind around the venue. More than a thousand people from all walks of life in the Tanggu district waited at the venue for four hours before the ship arrived, beating gongs and drums. At the welcome rally, Tan Heguang, Deputy District Governor of Tanggu District, first extended congratulations and condolences to Liu Lianren on behalf of the Tanggu District People's Committee. He said: Compatriot Liu Lianren's fourteen years of suffering are entirely the crime of Japanese militarists violating humanitarianism and international regulations. During the war of aggression against China, the Japanese army abducted countless of our compatriots, forced them to perform labor under the threat of bayonets, and cruelly abused and persecuted them, causing a large number of our compatriots to die. Tan Heguang said that whenever we think of this, we cannot help but feel angry at the Japanese militarists who should be held responsible for their crimes. What is even more intolerable is that after compatriot Liu Lianren was discovered, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government not only did not admit their crimes to the Chinese people and provide Liu Lianren with responsible treatment and compensation, but also attempted to persecute Liu Lianren further. This fully proves that the Kishi Nobusuke government holds a hostile attitude towards the 600 million Chinese people. If the Kishi Nobusuke government continues to insist on being hostile to the Chinese people, it is destined to suffer disastrous defeat.

Tan Heguang also said that, on the contrary, through the case of compatriot Liu Lianren, we have once again seen the friendly behavior of the Japanese people towards the Chinese people. Here, we express our heartfelt thanks to the Japanese people and related organizations for their assistance and support to compatriot Liu Lianren. He concluded by saying that Liu Lianren, who has suffered greatly, is about to return to his hometown and reunite with his relatives after fourteen years of separation. We wish you a speedy recovery and, together with all your compatriots, contribute your strength to building our socialism.

Liu Lianren spoke amid the enthusiastic applause of the crowd. He recounted his inhuman and tragic life in Japan for fourteen years, and expressed his gratitude to the Japanese people and the three Japanese organizations for their help. He also resolutely demanded that the Japanese government be responsible for compensating all his losses.

Wan Ying, a representative from all walks of life in Tanggu District, expressed her firm support for Liu Lianren's demand that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government compensate for all losses. She said that the blood debts owed by Japanese militarists to the Chinese people are countless, but the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government has not shown any remorse to the Chinese people. This extremely hostile behavior towards the Chinese people makes us feel extremely angry. We have every right and reason to demand that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government be held responsible for this inhuman atrocity.

After Liu Lianren arrived in Tianjin, the person in charge of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee held a consolation dinner that evening. Li Shizeng, Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal People's Committee, raised a glass at the banquet to congratulate Liu Lianren on the reunion of his entire family, including his wife Zhao Yulan, fourth younger brother Liu Liandeng, and son Liu Huanxin.

    哭着被掳到日本　笑着回到了祖国
    塘沽各界欢迎刘连仁
    一致要求岸信介政府赔偿损失
    新华社天津15日电　被日本法西斯掳去的难胞刘连仁今天下午乘日本轮船“白山丸”到达天津新港的时候，受到了祖国人民的热烈欢迎。
    在受尽了十四年的苦难之后，刘连仁今天回到祖国的时候，非常激动。轮船还没有靠岸，他在甲板上就远远地向岸上欢迎的人群挥动着帽子，一会又高举着双手鼓掌。他走下轮船就受到中国红十字会总会副秘书长彭炎、倪斐君和国际联络部部长纪锋以及山东红十字会代表等人的热情接待。在码头上，刘连仁同含着热泪来迎接他的妻子赵玉兰（前误为周玉兰）、四弟刘连登、儿子刘焕新聚首团圆。刘连仁激动地对记者说：“我被日本军国主义掠走出国的时候是哭着走的，可是今天我笑着回到了祖国，这是多么大的变化啊！”
    在离码头不远的新港海员俱乐部广场上为刘连仁举行了盛大的欢迎会。会场门前搭起的一座彩牌楼上写着“欢迎难胞刘连仁返回祖国”的金字，会场四周无数面彩旗迎风招展，塘沽区各界群众一千多人在轮船到达前四小时就敲锣打鼓地等候在会场上。在欢迎大会上，塘沽区副区长谭鹤光首先代表塘沽区人民委员会向刘连仁表示祝贺和慰问。他说：难胞刘连仁十四年的苦难遭遇，完全是日本军国主义者违反人道主义和国际法规的罪行。日本军队在侵华战争期间掳走了我们无数的同胞，在刺刀的威胁下强迫他们进行劳役，并且残酷地进行虐待和迫害，使我们的大批同胞死于非命。谭鹤光说，每当我们想到这里的时候，不能不使我们对应负罪行责任的日本军国主义者感到愤怒。更使人不能容忍的是同胞刘连仁被发现以后，日本岸信介政府不仅不向中国人民承认罪行、对刘连仁给以负责的处理和赔偿，还企图对刘连仁进行新的迫害，这就充分证明了岸信介政府对六亿中国人民抱着敌对的态度。岸信介政府如果继续坚持与中国人民为敌的态度，注定是要碰得头破血流的。
    谭鹤光又说，与此相反，通过难胞刘连仁这一事件，使我们再一次地看到了日本人民对中国人民的友好行为，在这里我们向给同胞刘连仁以协助和支持的日本人民及有关团体表示衷心的感谢。他最后说，受尽了苦难的刘连仁同胞就要返回自己的家乡，与离别十四年的亲人团聚，我们谨祝你早日恢复健康，与所有的同胞一道为建设我们的社会主义贡献自己的力量。
    刘连仁在群众热烈掌声中讲话，他叙述了自己十四年在日本过的非人的悲惨生活，并且对日本人民和日本三团体对他的帮助表示感谢。他并且坚决要求日本政府负责赔偿他的一切损失。
    塘沽区各界代表万英在讲话中表示坚决支持刘连仁向日本岸信介政府提出赔偿一切损失的要求。她说，日本军国主义者所欠下中国人民的血债是数不尽、算不完的，可是日本岸信介政府却没有向中国人民谢罪的表示，这种极端仇视中国人民的行为使我们感到无比的愤怒，我们完全有权利和理由要求日本岸信介政府对这种违反人道的暴行负责。
    刘连仁到达天津以后，天津市人民委员会负责人当晚举行了慰问便宴，市人民委员会副秘书长李士曾在宴会上举杯祝贺刘连仁同他的妻子赵玉兰、四弟刘连登和儿子刘焕新全家团聚。
