    One's personal history is written by one's own words and deeds
    Yang Xianzhen

    After a person is born into this world, except for those who die young, they will live for decades. The decades of life each person leads after adulthood until they stop breathing constitute their own history (this calculates each person's history from adulthood onwards, because before adulthood they are still children, and even God forgives children for talking nonsense and making mistakes). As for whether the colors painted on the canvas of each person's history are white, gray, pink, or bright red, although objective factors also play a role, it can be asserted that subjective factors play a decisive role.

    Needless to mention the rightists outside the Party. The rightists within the Party, due to the tide of the Chinese revolution sweeping them into the revolutionary ranks, once painted a chapter of their historical process in red; however, because after being swept into the revolutionary ranks, they were not determined to transform their thinking according to communist principles, but stubbornly clung to individualism, their history gradually changed from red to pink, gray, and finally to white or black. All of this is concretely reflected in their words, deeds, and actions in daily life. And this constitutes each person's own history. Each person's daily life performance is also each person's own historical performance.

    Someone said, "If you want to defeat me, you'll never succeed in your lifetime!"

    Indeed, if a person walks upright and acts justly, others cannot defeat them.

    Even Chiang Kai-shek, if he had not opposed the revolution, no one could have defeated him.

    Bad people defeat themselves. They are negating themselves every day, and smearing their own history. For example, a rightist is not made a rightist only when the organization draws a conclusion about him; in fact, his rightist history has long been written by himself, stroke by stroke, and the conclusion is merely a reflection of his history.

    Rightists are negative teachers for every Party member and Communist Youth League member.

    In view of how the rightists wrote their own history, every Party member and Communist Youth League member should think carefully about how to write their own history.

    Everyone is writing their own history every day and every moment. When writing your own history, remember not to smear your own history.

    We are fortunate to live in an era that already has Marxism-Leninism. Every Party member and Communist Youth League member must always remember to use Marxism-Leninism as the guide for their thoughts and actions, to truly achieve consistency between words and deeds, to consciously write their own history, and to always maintain the bright red color of their history.

    个人历史是由自己的言行写成的
    杨献珍
    一个人出生到世界上来以后，除了早夭的以外，总要活上几十年。每个人在成年以后一直到停止呼吸的几十年的生活，就构成各人自己的历史（这是把各人的历史从成年以后算起，是因为成年以前还是小孩子，而小孩子说胡话，犯错误，连上帝也是要原谅的）。至于各人自己的历史画面上所涂的颜色是白的，灰的，粉红的或者鲜红的，虽然客观因素也起作用，但主观因素起决定性的作用，则是可以断言的。
    党外的右派分子不必说了。党内的右派分子，由于中国革命浪潮把他们卷入到革命队伍中来，因而使得他们的历史过程中的某一章节曾经一度涂上了红颜色；但是，又由于他们被卷入革命队伍以后，没有决心按照共产主义原则来改造自己的思想，而还是死死地抱着个人主义不放，于是他们的历史又逐渐由红色的变成粉红色的，灰色的，最后变成了白色的，或者黑色的。所有这一切，都是由他们自己在日常生活中一言一行一举一动具体地体现出来的。而这就构成各人自己的历史。每个人的日常生活的表现也就是每个人自己的历史表演。
    有人说，“你要想打倒我，你一辈子也莫想！”
    的确，一个人如果是走得端，行得正，别人是无法打倒他的。
    就连蒋介石，如果他不反革命，也没有谁能够把他打倒。
    坏人都是自己打倒自己。他自己每天在那里作着否定自己的事，自己在那里给自己的历史抹黑。例如右派分子并不是在组织上给他作结论的时候才成为右派的，事实上他的右派历史早已由他自己一笔一笔地写成了，结论不过是他的历史的反映。
    右派分子是每个党员和青年团员的反面教员。
    鉴于右派分子是怎样写他们自己的历史的，每个党员和青年团员都应当好好地想一想怎样来写自己的历史。
    每个人每天每时每刻都在写自己的历史。在写自己的历史的时候，要记住不要自己给自己的历史抹黑。
    我们幸运地生活在已经有了马克思列宁主义的时代，每个党员和青年团员时时刻刻都要记住要以马克思列宁主义来作自己的思想行动的指导，要真正作到言行一致，自觉地来写自己的历史，永远保持自己历史的鲜红颜色。
