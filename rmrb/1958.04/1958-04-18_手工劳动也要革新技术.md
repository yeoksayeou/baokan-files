    Manual Labor Must Also Innovate Technology
    Jing Yu
    In our industrial production sector, a significant portion of operations relies on manual labor. Due to factors such as production tools, operating methods, and other working conditions, this labor is generally characterized by high intensity and low efficiency. Therefore, actively reforming production tools, improving production methods, reducing labor intensity, and increasing work efficiency are important measures for achieving a great leap forward in manual labor.
    Not everyone can correctly understand this leap forward measure. Some people say that improving hand tools is an insignificant trifle, and manual labor will eventually be replaced by machines. In the absence of machine replacements, even if a great deal of effort is spent on making some improvements, it cannot match the effectiveness of machines. In their view, it seems that technological innovation should only wait for future replacement with machines.
    Can we adopt a waiting attitude towards technological reform? No, we cannot. Technological innovation must proceed from the actual situation. Our country is an economically backward country, and with the great development of industry and agriculture, the number of mechanical equipment needed in various fields is very large. However, the production of mechanical equipment cannot keep up with the demand for the time being. Therefore, it is impossible to change manual labor to mechanical production all at once. Take agriculture as an example, wouldn't it be great to replace all the backward tools used by farmers with mechanical tools? Of course, it would be great, and we are working hard to mechanize agriculture as quickly as possible, but it is not possible at present. What attitude should be adopted towards things that cannot be done all at once? The only correct attitude is to proceed from reality. Mechanize what can be mechanized, semi-mechanize what cannot be mechanized, and for what cannot be semi-mechanized, make some possible improvements in tools and methods. Recently, an tool reform movement is being launched in agriculture. In many places, what was originally transported by shoulder and back is now being transported by carts and semi-mechanized methods, increasing production efficiency by one to several times, and the sprouts of a technological revolution in agricultural production have emerged. Can the manual labor part of industrial production also see new sprouts of technological revolution like agricultural production? The answer is yes. As long as everyone establishes the correct attitude towards tool reform and brings into play the spirit of exploration, new production tools will emerge in an endless stream. The H威 water exploration team of the Guizhou Geological Bureau creatively used the bottom-enlarging blasting method and improved the drilling bit in manual tunneling, increasing work efficiency by one time. The amount of work that originally required one year to complete can now be done in only half a year. This matter, innovating the technology of manual operation, is also of great significance for developing the productive forces.
    It should be admitted that the effectiveness of hand tools is, after all, inferior to that of machines. For example, a hand-pushed cart is not as good as a car. However, we do not therefore belittle the significance of improving hand tools. Moreover, manual labor cannot be completely replaced by machines. Therefore, improving old hand tools and creating new hand tools is not an insignificant matter, but a "significant" matter, a matter related to how manual labor can make a great leap forward, and should be valued.

### 手工劳动也要革新技术

    手工劳动也要革新技术
    静宇
    我们的工业生产部门中有相当大的一部分操作是要靠手工劳动的。由于生产工具、操作方法以及其他劳动条件等原因，这种劳动一般是强度较大，效率较低。因此，积极改革生产工具，改进生产方法，减轻劳动强度，提高工作效率，是实现手工劳动大跃进的一个重要措施。
    这种跃进措施并不是所有的人都能正确理解的。有人说，改进手工工具是无足轻重的玩艺，手工劳动将来总是要用机器代替的。在没有机器代替的情况下，即使花了很大的力气，做了一部分改进，也赶不上机器的效能。在他们看来，好像革新技术，只有等待将来更换机器。
    能不能采取等待的态度对待技术改革呢？不能。革新技术必须从实际情况出发。我国是一个经济落后的国家，在工农业大发展的形势下，各方面需要机械设备的数量很大。而机械装备的生产一时还赶不上需要。因此，要想一下子把手工劳动改变为机械生产是不可能的。拿农业来说，把农民手头用的落后工具统统改为机械工具，不是很好吗？当然很好，而且我们正在努力尽可能快地使农业机械化，但目前还办不到。对于一下子办不到的事情采取什么态度呢？唯一正确的态度就是从实际出发。能机械化的就机械化，不能机械化的就半机械化，不能半机械化的，就从工具上和方法上做一些可能做到的改进。近来，农业方面正在掀起一个工具改革运动，许多地方原来用肩挑背负运输的，现在已经改用车子和半机械化的方法，生产效率提高一倍以至数倍，出现了农业生产技术革命的萌芽。工业生产的手工劳动部分能不能像农业生产那样出现技术革命的新的萌芽呢？答案是肯定的。只要大家树立了改革工具的正确态度，发挥钻研精神，那末，新的生产工具就会源源不绝地涌现出来。贵州地质局赫威水勘探队在手工掘进中，创造性地运用了扩底爆破法，改进了钻眼钎头，使工作效率提高一倍。原来需要一年时间完成的工作量，现在只要半年时间就行了。这件事，革新手工操作的技术，对于发展生产力同样有重大意义。
    应该承认：手工工具的效能毕竟是比不上机器的，例如，手推的车子就比不上汽车。但是，我们并不因此贬低手工工具改良的意义。而且手工劳动并非机器所能全部代替。因此，改进旧的手工工具，创造新的手工工具，不是无足轻重的事，而是“有足轻重”的事，是关系到手工劳动如何大跃进的事，应当得到重视。
