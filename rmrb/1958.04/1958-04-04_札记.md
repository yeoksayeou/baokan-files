    Notes

    What Else Can Be Said?

    A report by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on April 2nd stated: “The average person in the socialist camp lived better last year than at any time since the war.” It went on to paint a thriving economic picture. The report's description of the economic situation in European capitalist countries, however, was bleak: "The stagnation trend in the three major industrial countries of Western Europe—Britain, France, and West Germany—is very likely to intensify this year... The other countries of Western Europe... will ultimately follow the same path.”

    This is a very clear contrast. At a time when the shadow of economic recession looms over the capitalist world, it more fully proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. It seems that those who are accustomed to saying that the leap-forward progress of the socialist countries' economy is "pure propaganda" or "deceptive" have nothing else to say this time!

    Rely on Yourself Rather Than Others

    West German Defense Minister Strauss, in an interview with a reporter from the British "Daily Mirror" on April 2nd, acknowledged that the United States and Britain are "world powers." However, when he spoke of France, he said with a contemptuous tone, "How terrible it is that France has artificially tried to become a so-called great power after the Second World War."

    Currently, there are a group of people in France who are enthusiastically advocating "Franco-German cooperation." They believe that if France can pull West Germany to its side, it will no longer be seen as a second-rate partner by the United States and Britain. However, Strauss's remarks poured cold water on them. It turns out that in the eyes of West Germany, France is just an insignificant small country.

    It is very clear that in the Western camp, which is full of infighting, it is impossible to maintain the status of a great power by relying on the promotion of others. However, there are still ways for France to become a true great power. The question is whether there is the determination to change the current disastrous policies that harm national interests. If Strauss's words can make the French government realize this, it would be a great contribution to France.

    札记
    还有什么话说
    联合国欧洲经济委员会4月2日的一份报告说：社会主义阵营的“普通人去年生活得比战后任何时候要好”。接着描绘了一幅欣欣向荣的经济景象。在同一个报告里谈到的欧洲资本主义国家的经济情况，却是一片暗淡：“西欧三个主要工业国——英国、法国和西德——今年停滞的趋向十分可能加剧……西欧其他国家……最终是要异途同归。”
    这是一个再鲜明不过的对比了。在经济衰退的阴云笼罩着资本主义世界的时候，更充分证明社会主义制度比资本主义制度无比优越。看来，惯于把社会主义国家经济的飞跃进展，说成是“纯粹是宣传”或“骗人”的人，这回还有什么可说的呢！
    求人不如求己
    西德国防部长施特劳斯2日向英国“每日镜报”记者发表谈话，承认美国和英国是“世界大国”。但是，当谈起法国的时候，他却用轻蔑的口吻说，“法国在第二次大战后要人为地变成一个所谓大国，这是多么可怕”。
    目前，法国正有一批人在热心地鼓吹“法德合作”。他们认为，法国如果能够把西德拉在自己一边，就可以再也不被美英两国看成次等伙伴了。但是，施特劳斯的谈话却对他们当头泼了一盆冷水。原来，在西德眼里，法国也不过是一个微不足道的小国而已。
    事情很清楚，在充满倾轧的西方阵营里，想靠别人的提携来维持大国地位是不行的。不过，法国要成为一个真正的大国，办法还是有的。问题是有没有决心改变现行的危害民族利益的灾难性政策。如果施特劳斯这番话能够使法国政府认识到这一点，这倒是他对法国的一大贡献。
