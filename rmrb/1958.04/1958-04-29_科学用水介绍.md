    Introduction to Scientific Water Use
    The Anjie Irrigation Area (short for Chao'an and Jieyang Joint Irrigation Area) is a thousand-jin irrigation area in the Shantou Special Zone that has increased production year after year. Their arrangement for scientific water use is as follows: The growth process of rice is divided into several stages: transplanting and greening period; initial and peak tillering period; post-tillering to jointing period; booting and heading-flowering period; green ripening period; and yellow ripening to harvesting. Then, according to the growth characteristics of rice in each stage, drainage and irrigation and field drying systems are formulated. The general principle is "shallow water and frequent irrigation, timely field drying." For example, after transplanting early rice, the seedlings are small and easily affected by frost, so it is advisable to irrigate with one to two inches of water to maintain soil temperature and prevent wind; thereafter, focus on shallow water and frequent irrigation to promote greening and tillering of the seedlings; during the late tillering to jointing period, seize the opportunity to dry the fields, drain the water, and dry until slight cracks appear before restoring irrigation. This allows the roots to penetrate deeper, absorb fertilizer, control ineffective tillering (those that do not bear grains), prevent lodging in the later stages, and reduce pests and diseases. From the heading and flowering to the green ripening period, wet irrigation should be maintained to resist lodging and increase the grain filling rate. As for drying the fields for late rice, the Anjie Irrigation Area dries two to three times. The first time is in the late tillering period, dried until slight cracks appear; the second time is in the jointing period, dried until hard cracks appear; and the third time is in the green ripening period, generally dried harder to harden the stems and resist lodging. After heavy rains, drainage should be timely to avoid affecting the growth of seedlings. In addition, the drainage and irrigation management departments of the Anjie Irrigation Area also particularly emphasize that after the summer harvest, water should be retained in the fields and field drying should be strictly prevented. They believe that this is beneficial for plowing and harrowing in the next season and maintaining soil fertility.

    科学用水介绍
    安揭灌区（潮安、揭阳联合灌区简称）是汕头专区连年增产的千斤灌区，他们对于科学用水是这样安排的：把水稻生长的过程，分为移植回青期；分蘖初盛期、分蘖后至拔节期；孕穗及抽穗开花期；青熟期；黄熟至收割等几个生长阶段，然后按照水稻各个阶段生长的特点制定排灌和晒田制度。一般是以“浅水勤灌，适时晒田”为原则。比如早造插秧后，禾苗幼小，容易受冻，宜灌水一市寸至二市寸，以保持土温和防风；以后则着重浅水勤灌，促使禾苗回青分蘖；分蘖后期至拔节期则抓紧时机晒田，把水排出，晒至微裂再恢复灌水。这样可以使禾根扎深，吸取肥分，控制无效分蘖（不结谷粒的），防止后期倒伏，减少病虫害。抽穗扬花至青熟期则掌握湿灌溉，以抗拒倒伏，增加谷粒饱实率。至于晚造晒田，安揭灌溉区是晒二至三次，第一次在分蘖后期，晒至微裂，第二次在拔节期，晒至硬裂，第三次在青熟期，一般晒得较硬，把茎秆晒硬，以抗拒倒伏。每逢大雨以后，还要及时排水，以免影响禾苗生长。此外安揭灌区的排灌管理部门还特别强调夏收后要做到田间保水，严防晒田，他们认为这样做有利于下造耕耙和保持土壤肥力。
