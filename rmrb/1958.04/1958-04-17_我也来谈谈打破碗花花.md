    Let Me Also Talk About *Calendula arvensis*
    Ai Wu
    Seeing articles about *Calendula arvensis* in the newspaper, I can't help but want to talk about it too. *Calendula arvensis* was very common in my hometown of Xinfan County, Sichuan. I haven't seen it for many years, but I still have a very good impression of it. This isn't just because it grows by small ditches, its deep green leaves and red flowers reflected in the clear water, giving a beautiful feeling. It's because it once cured me of a serious case of malaria.

    When I was about fourteen or fifteen years old, I suffered from "bai zi" (擺子) for several months, which is malaria. There was no medicine to treat it, and I didn't know what medicine to use. At most, when the malaria attacked, my family would break off willow and peach branches and beat me on the back while telling me to run away for a while. It was said that this could drive away the "bai zi" ghost. Of course, it didn't work, and the "bai zi" became more and more serious day by day. When the "bai zi" attacked, my senses became very abnormal. I remember being very cold and wanting to roast a warming basket, but I felt that the warming basket, which was usually very light, became very heavy in my hands. My mother asked me how sick I was, and I felt like her voice was like thunder. After the "bai zi" attack was over, I would return to normal. Once my mother understood this situation, she felt that it couldn't be delayed any longer, so she went to the elderly people in the village to seek prescriptions and ask for medicine.

    One afternoon, my mother took me to a small ditch to pick *Calendula arvensis*, brought it back, and pounded it into a paste. When I went to bed, she applied it to the wrist of my left hand (the side facing the palm) and wrapped it with a strip of cloth. The next morning, she took off the cloth strip, and I saw a blister the size of an egg on my wrist. It didn't hurt, but I felt a slight burning sensation. From then on, the malaria never came back, and I was completely healthy. Therefore, *Calendula arvensis* left a very deep impression on me. And the mark on my left wrist lasted for several years before it faded away.

    Quinine pills are very bitter, and they cause tinnitus and discomfort after taking them. Could *Calendula arvensis* be used to extract and make a topical medicine? I ask medical scholars to study this.

    By the way, let me also mention a wild grass called "he ma" (合麻), perhaps it should be called "ge ma" (割麻). When we were young, we were most afraid of this grass. As soon as your hand touched its leaves, it would hurt terribly. It is said that when Zhang Xianzhong was young, he drove horses to Sichuan and slapped the landlords in the face. He also squatted to defecate and wiped his bottom with grass, and happened to grab "he ma," which immediately made him feel pain like a knife. He cursed loudly, "Sichuan is not only full of hateful people, but even the grass is hateful!" This may not be historically accurate, but it shows that "he ma" is indeed a poisonous grass. Farmers hate this grass the most and hoe it out when they see it, so it may be extinct. I think it can also be studied to extract useful medicine from poisonous grass.

    我也来谈谈打破碗花花
    艾芜
    在报上，看见了讲打破碗花花，我忍不住也想讲一讲。打破碗花花，在我的家乡四川新繁县是很多的，许多年没有看见了，我至今还有极好的印象，这到不是因为它长在小沟旁边，把它深绿的叶子和红色的花朵，映在清澈的流水中，给人一种美丽的感觉，是它曾经给我治好一种严重的疟疾。
    大约在我十四五岁的时候，打了几个月的摆子，即是害了疟疾。没有药医，也不知道用什么药医，顶多疟疾发作的时候，就由家里人折下柳枝桃枝，在我的背后，边打边赶，叫我逃跑一阵。据说这样就可以赶跑摆子鬼。当然不见效，摆子就一天一天严重起来。摆子一发作了，感觉变得十分异常。我记得很冷，要烤烘笼，却觉得平常很轻的烘笼，提在手里，变得非常之重。我母亲问我病得怎样，我感到她说话的声音，仿佛在打雷似的。摆子发作完毕，就又恢复正常。我的母亲一了解这种情形，觉得再不能拖下去了，就去找乡里的老年人寻方问药。
    有一天下午，母亲带我到小沟边摘了打破碗花花，拿回来捶烂，当我上床睡觉的时候，给我敷在左手的手颈上，（正对手掌心那一面）再缠上布条。第二天早上，她给我取去了布条，我看见手颈上肿了鸡蛋那么大一个水泡，并不疼，只感到有点烧辣辣的。从此疟疾就不再发了，完全是个好人。因此打破碗花花给我留下了极其深刻的印象。并且左手手颈上的痕迹，一直留了几年才行散去。
    吃奎宁丸很苦，而且吃后耳鸣不舒服，是不是可以用打破碗花花，提炼出来制成一种外敷的药，这请医药学者加以研究。
    顺便再附带谈一种叫做合麻的野草，也许应该叫做割麻。我们小时候，最怕这种草，只要手一摸它的叶子，就疼得要命。据说张献忠年轻时，赶马到四川，给地主们打过耳光，又在解大便时，扯草揩屁股，恰好扯着了合麻，立刻使他痛如刀割。他大骂起来，“四川不但人可恶，连草也可恶。”这可能不大合历史事实，但却说出合麻的厉害确实是毒草。这种草农民最讨厌它，见了就锄去，可能已绝迹，我想也可以研究下子，在毒草中取出有用的药来。
