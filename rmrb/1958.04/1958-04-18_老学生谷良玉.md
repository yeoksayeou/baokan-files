    Old Student Gu Liangyu
    Gu Liangyu is one of the sixty-three students in the Cadre Special Class of the Beijing Railway Institute.
    Gu Liangyu was originally the vice chairman of the Beijing Railway Administration District Trade Union. When he entered school in 1954, he had less than a primary school education. However, after more than two years of hard work, he has become one of the best students in the class. Now, he has completed major basic courses such as physics, chemistry, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, and is smoothly studying professional courses.
    In the beginning, Gu Liangyu encountered many difficulties. When the teacher talked about the four arithmetic operations and complex fractions, he couldn't understand. But when he thought about this being a task assigned to him by the Party, his confidence increased. From then on, he seized every opportunity to study hard and improved his learning methods. He focused on the "preview" link, roughly reading the chapters the teacher was going to lecture on before class, and then concentrated on listening. In this way, he could understand most of what was said in class.

    老学生谷良玉
    北京铁道学院干部特别班有六十三名学员，谷良玉就是其中的一个。
    谷良玉原是北京铁路管理局区工会副主席，他在1954年入学时，不到高小文化程度，但是，经过二年多努力钻研，他已经成为班上成绩最优秀的学员之一。现在，他已学完了物理、化学、代数、几何、三角等主要基础课，并正在顺利地学习专业课程。
    在开始学习的时候，谷良玉遇到许多困难。当教员讲到四则题和繁分数时，他听不懂。但是当他想到这是党交给他的任务时，他的信心提高了。从此，他抓紧一切时间，努力钻研，并改进学习方法。他抓紧“预习”这一环节，听课前先把教员要讲的章节粗读一遍，然后集中精力听讲，这样，堂上讲的绝大部分都能听懂了。
