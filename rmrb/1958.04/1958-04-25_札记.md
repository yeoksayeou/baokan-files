    Helpless

    The well-known American commentator Joseph Alsop recently said in an article entitled "Eisenhower's Gamble": "The Eisenhower administration has now quite firmly embraced a light-hearted principle in dealing with the depression, which is: to hope for the best without estimating the worst." Alsop believes that Eisenhower's approach "is engaging in a chilling gamble."

    Alsop's remarks seem to be not entirely without reason. Because judging from a series of frantic actions recently taken by Eisenhower to expand government spending, he is indeed undertaking a gamble that risks expanding the fiscal deficit and inflation. However, it would be too naive to take the president's deliberately calm posture seriously. Because the Eisenhower administration today is actually in a state of desperation, like ants on a hot pot, in dealing with the crisis; rather than "hoping for the best," it is more like helplessly waiting for the worst to come.

    Annoyed and Going Crazy

    According to an Associated Press report, Eisenhower, at a half-hour press conference on the 23rd, was "sometimes very happy, sometimes very annoyed." The Associated Press report did not reveal what made him "very happy," but it did reveal two things that made him "very annoyed." One thing was that a reporter recounted that Eisenhower had suggested two weeks ago that Americans buy "anything" to cope with the recession; the reporter then asked the president what he had bought. The report said that this made "Eisenhower a little angry again," and the president told the reporter to ask his personal assistant if he had bought anything, as he himself did not know at all. Another thing was that a female reporter said that some people in Congress had criticized Eisenhower's plan to reorganize the Department of Defense; the president immediately turned red in the face and questioned the reporter, angrily saying, "Congress is going crazy."

    Being unable to cope with the economic crisis and facing great pressure to expand armaments and prepare for war are the reasons why Eisenhower is "very annoyed." It seems that the "craziness" of the US Congress is also about to be contagious to Eisenhower.

    束手无策
    美国著名评论家约瑟夫·艾尔索普最近在一篇题为“艾森豪威尔的赌博”的文章中说：“艾森豪威尔政府在对付萧条的工作中现在已经相当坚定地抱定一种轻松如意的原则，那就是：希望发生最好的情况而又不估计到最坏的情况。”艾尔索普认为，艾森豪威尔的这种做法“是在干一种令人毛骨悚然的赌博”。
    艾尔索普的这段话，看来好像也不是全没道理。因为就艾森豪威尔最近所采取的一系列疯狂扩大政府开支的行动来看，他确是在进行一项冒扩大财政赤字和通货膨胀危险的赌博。不过，如果把这位总统故作镇静的姿态当真，却未免太幼稚了。因为艾森豪威尔政府今天在对待危机上实际正好像热锅上的蚂蚁一样处于走投无路的状态中；与其说它是在“希望发生最好的情况”，倒不如说它是在束手无策地等待最坏情况的到来。
    恼火和发疯
    据美联社报道，艾森豪威尔23日在半小时的记者招待会上，“有时很高兴，有时很恼火”。在美联社的消息中看不出来使他“很高兴”的是什么，可是却透露出两件使他“很恼火”的事情。一件是，一位记者追述说，艾森豪威尔两周以前曾建议美国人“什么东西”都买，可以应付衰退；这位记者就问总统买了些什么东西呢。消息说，这使“艾森豪威尔又有点生气”，总统让记者问他的私人助理，究竟他买什么东西没有，他本人一点也不知道。另一件是，一位女记者说国会中有人指责艾森豪威尔改组国防部的计划；这位总统立刻面红耳赤地一面责问这个记者，一面气呼呼地说：“国会发疯了”。
    经济危机已穷于应付，而扩军备战又遭到很大压力；艾森豪威尔“很恼火”的原因就在这里。看来，美国国会的“发疯”也要传染给艾森豪威尔了。
