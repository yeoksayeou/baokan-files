The news that the Xingye Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang Province, had purchased a tractor caused a sensation among the farmers of the surrounding agricultural cooperatives. When the Xingye Cooperative used a tractor to pull a trailer to deliver grain, the farmers driving horse-drawn carts along the way automatically gave way to it, saying it was "our locomotive." When staying in inns, everyone always found the best place to park the tractor, all saying they wanted to take a good look at this "iron ox" that runs fast, pulls a lot, and doesn't eat grass.

The Xingye Cooperative's self-purchase and self-management of tractors was done after successful state-owned tractor station-led cultivation and leased tractor cultivation. One day last August, when the two newly purchased tractors were driven to the cooperative, the members unanimously agreed to give up the five best, spacious, and sun-facing main rooms in the entire cooperative as a tractor warehouse. Now, the members regard the tractor as the most valuable property of the entire cooperative, and they use the tractor very carefully, for fear of "hurting" the machine. Whenever they are off work, everyone automatically helps the tractor drivers wash and wipe the tractors. Therefore, after the tractor came to the cooperative, the number of malfunctions was greatly reduced compared to the past. During the winter overhaul, the two locomotives of Xingye Cooperative had the least wear and tear among all the tractors in the county.

Earlier, the drivers were most concerned about how much work they completed and how to exceed the quota; the members were concerned about the quality of cultivation. After the tractor belonged to the cooperative, the tractor drivers and the members recorded work points according to the quality and quantity of labor, so that the main laborers who controlled mechanical production were consistent with the interests of cooperative production; at the same time, the machine operation completely obeyed the cooperative's production plan and could be flexibly deployed according to production needs. This allowed the means of production to better serve the needs of production. Since then, the labor enthusiasm of tractor drivers and farm implement operators has been improved, and some difficulties that were previously difficult to solve have been solved by the members collectively. For example, tractor cultivation cannot ridge and cultivate soil, but can only be done on flat ground. However, according to local natural conditions, ridging is necessary. Now there is no such agricultural machinery, so the members created a method that combines tractors and old agricultural implements to solve it.

After the tractor was assigned to the agricultural cooperative, it brought a new trend of learning technology to the cadres and members of the agricultural cooperative. The enthusiasm of the members to learn technology and culture is higher than before. The night school in the first production team alone added 25 students last winter, and the phenomenon of absenteeism and truancy has also been greatly reduced. Members with a certain level of education are more eager to learn technology. Many young men and women often surround the tractor, touching this and asking that, asking the driver to teach them how to drive a tractor and explain the principle of machine structure. The tractor driver has become the most popular teacher, and the tractor has become the best teaching material. In just a few months, four members have learned to drive a tractor, and some members have also learned maintenance techniques.

The distribution of tractors to this agricultural cooperative has already brought great benefits to the members. Last autumn, because they used threshers, they were the first in the county to finish threshing and the first to deliver the grain purchase, and were praised and rewarded by the government. The superiority of mechanical cultivation in production is even greater, which basically solved the key problem of increasing production in this cooperative. Before mechanical cultivation, this cooperative had a lot of land and few people, especially during the busy seasons of spring plowing and summer weeding. Manpower and animal power were insufficient, and every year a part of the cultivated land was not sown or weeded in time, and there was no strength to engage in diversified operations. Last year, the implementation of mechanical cultivation (before August, it was using machines from the state-owned tractor station) changed this situation. Last year, the average yield per unit area of more than 600 hectares of farmland in this cooperative was 17.6% higher than that of the surrounding agricultural cooperatives, with a total increase of 135,000 catties of grain. In addition, the income from surplus labor engaged in sideline production and the savings in horse feed expenses increased income by 15,000 yuan. The average income of each laborer in the entire cooperative reached 408 yuan, which was 13.2% higher than in the good year of 1956. At the same time, the public accumulation of the cooperative also increased, and the public accumulation fund increased to 10% of the total income. (Attached picture)

    农业社有了拖拉机
    本报记者　邵永力
    黑龙江省拜泉县兴业农业生产合作社购买拖拉机的消息，哄动了周围农业社的农民。当兴业社用拖拉机拉着拖车送粮时，沿途赶马车的农民都自动给它让路，说那是“咱们的火车头”。住店的时候，大伙总是给拖拉机找最好的地方停放，都说要好好看看这个跑得快、拉得多、不吃草的“铁牛”。
    兴业合作社自买自营拖拉机，是经过国家拖拉机站代耕，租用拖拉机耕作成功以后才这样办的。去年8月的一天，当刚买到的两台拖拉机开到合作社时，社员们公议把全社最好的五间宽大的朝阳正房，让出做拖拉机的库房。现在，社员都把拖拉机当成全社最宝贵的财产，使用拖拉机非常仔细，就怕把机器使“伤”了。每当休工的时候，大家都自动的帮助拖拉机手洗洗擦擦。因此，拖拉机到合作社以后，发生故障的次数比过去大大减少了。冬季检修时，兴业社的两台机车，在全县拖拉机中是磨损最轻的。
    早先，驾驶员最关心的是完成工作量多少，如何超过定额；社员关心的是耕地质量好坏。拖拉机归社之后，拖拉机手和社员一样按劳动质量和数量记工分，掌握机械生产的主要劳动者和合作社生产的利益相一致；同时，机器作业完全服从合作社的生产计划，可以根据生产需要灵活调用。这就使生产工具更好地服从生产的要求。从此，拖拉机手、农具手的劳动积极性提高了，从前有些不易解决的困难，经过社员集体想办法解决了。如拖拉机耕作不能起垄培土，只能平作。而根据当地自然条件，必须垄作。现在还没有这种农机具，社员就创造出拖拉机和旧农具相结合的办法解决了。
    拖拉机到农业社之后，给农业社的干部和社员带来了学技术的新风气。社员学技术、学文化的热情比从前高，仅第一生产队的夜校，去冬就增加了二十五名学员，缺席、旷课的现象也大大减少了。有一定文化程度的社员学习技术的心情更迫切。许多青年男女，经常围着拖拉机，摸摸这个，问问那个，让驾驶员教开拖拉机和讲解机器构造原理。拖拉机手成了最受欢迎的教员，拖拉机成了最好的教材。在短短的几个月里，有四个社员已经学会了驾驶拖拉机，还有一些社员懂得了保养技术。
    拖拉机下放到这个农业合作社，已经给社员带来很大好处。去年秋天因为用脱谷机脱谷，他们在全县最先打完场，第一个送完征购粮，受到政府的表扬和奖励。机械耕作在生产上的优越性更是巨大，基本上解决了这个社的增产关键性问题。没有机耕以前，这个社地多人少，尤其在春耕、夏锄的农忙季节，人力、畜力不足，历年都有一部分耕地播种、铲趟不及时，更没有力量从事多种经营。去年实行机械耕作（8月以前是租用国营拖拉机站的机器），就改变了这种情况。去年这个社六百多公顷农田，平均单位面积产量比周围农业社高出17.6％，总共增产了十三万五千斤粮食，加上多余人力从事副业生产的收入和节省马草料的开支，增加收入一万五千元。全社每个劳动力的平均收入达到了四百零八元，比年成好的1956年还增加了13.2％。同时，合作社的公共积累也增加了，公积金增加到占总收入的10％。（附图片）
