·Small Sugar Mill·
The Ministry of Light Industry recently trial-built a small-scale, semi-mechanized sugar mill in Guangdong. The total investment was 8,000 yuan, and it was built in three months. This mill can process 15 tons of sugar cane per day. Assuming it produces for 90 days a year, it can produce more than 178 tons of sugar. It is estimated that the industrial and commercial profits and taxes from this sugar will roughly offset the entire factory construction investment.

To build such a small mill, the factory building area only needs to be 130 square meters. If there are larger ancestral halls or ancient temples locally, they can be used as factory buildings, eliminating the need to build new factory buildings, which can save 1,000 yuan in investment. The main equipment of the sugar mill is a sugar cane crusher. The auxiliary equipment is exactly the same as a manual sugar mill. The power only needs a 15-16 horsepower gas engine or boiler tractor. If it is used in conjunction with irrigation and drainage machinery, there is no need to purchase it separately. This mill requires 16 production workers. Except for two technicians who need to undergo half a year of training, the others can be concurrently employed by farmers, without the need for fixed workers.

In addition to sugar production, this mill can also engage in the production of by-products such as winemaking and paper pulp, with an estimated annual income of 1,000 yuan. This type of small sugar mill can be built in areas along the Yangtze River and south of the Yangtze River that are suitable for decentralized planting of sugar cane.

    ·小糖厂·
    轻工业部最近在广东试建一个小型半机械化制糖厂，全部投资八千元，三个月建成。这个厂每天可以处理甘蔗十五吨，假定一年生产九十天，能产糖一百七十八吨多。估计这些糖的工商利润和税收，与全部建厂投资大体相抵。
    兴建这样的小厂，厂房面积只要一百三十平方公尺，如当地有较大的祠堂或古庙，可用来作厂房，不必另盖厂房，这样可以节省投资一千元。制糖厂的主要设备是一台甘蔗压榨机。附属设备同手工操作的糖厂完全一样。动力只需一台十五—十六马力煤气机或锅驼机，如与排灌机械合用，也不必另外购置。这个厂需要十六名生产工人，除两名技工须经过半年训练外，其他都可由农民兼业，不需要固定工人。
    这个厂除了制糖外，还可经营造酒、纸浆等副产品生产，估计每年可收益一千元。这种小型糖厂，在长江沿岸及长江以南适于分散种植甘蔗的地区都可兴办。
