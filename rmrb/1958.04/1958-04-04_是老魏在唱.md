"It's Old Wei Singing..."
Liu Dawei

The night, a gentle breeze softly knocks on the door.

The women's production team leader, having dug pit mud all day, after dinner, burning the last of the firewood, habitually sits cross-legged on the warm kang: while sewing shoe soles, she habitually takes the earphones (from the crystal radio) from the wall and puts them on, this habit has almost become common to all the male and female commune members in the village. Everyone's fondness for the programs is also largely the same, apart from the news, they almost all like to listen to operas and Ping operas; frankly speaking, the symphonies, solos, and instrumental pieces often broadcast in the earphones have not attracted her special attention, but tonight is different, as soon as she puts on the earphones, she is attracted by a tenor solo:

"The next program, tenor solo,
'Vasya's Song.' Performed by Wei Mingquan, soloist of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra."

The women's production team leader was taken aback. Could it be the same name, there is also a comrade named Wei Mingquan among the cadres sent down to our commune, could it be him singing? Wei Mingquan usually works in the fields, and the tone of his voice is not very loud, how can his voice be so loud when he starts singing? As she listened more carefully, she continued to hear familiar names: Yang Daoxian... That's right, the female comrade who cut her hair short, sent down to the sixteenth team, so she sings so beautifully! And Liu Qi's bassoon solo, she thought: it must be that thing Liu Qi brought when he first came, long and red, almost like a bamboo tube.

The next day, when everyone was resting, they talked about the programs broadcast in the earphones last night:

"Last night, there was Old Wei and them singing on the earphones?"

"You said he learned to sing like a stammerer, how did he learn it so well!"

Wei Mingquan, carrying a manure basket, followed the cart delivering pit mud, and came to the field. He put down the manure basket, jumped onto the cart, and unloaded the pit mud from the cart with an iron shovel, covered in sweat. In an instant, everyone happily surrounded him, talking to him all at once:

"Old Wei, we heard you singing on the earphones last night."

"Great, shall we welcome Old Wei to sing a bit now?" A burst of warm applause immediately erupted in the fields.

Wei Mingquan jumped down from the cart, one hand holding the iron shovel; the other hand habitually leaned on the edge of the cart, as if on a piano. Over the years, he had sung more than once on the stages and in the concert halls of major cities across the country, receiving cheers and flowers from millions of spectators, but like today, facing the great nature of the motherland, standing in the fields that are leaping towards the south bank of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, singing for the peasant brothers and sisters holding hoes and iron shovels, this was the first time, how could he not be excited? What to sing? It's not that he doesn't have many programs, nor is it that he's afraid the peasants won't like foreign songs and lyrical songs, but he himself has become dissatisfied with his repertoire. When he stands in front of these leaping people to begin singing, he naturally thinks of the night battle of digging pit mud on New Year's Eve; it is these people who are still working in the fields on the first day of the Lunar New Year, for the great leap forward in agriculture, for crossing the Yellow River and crossing the Yangtze River as soon as possible! He wants to sing about the heroic acts of people including himself. However, he could not find a song that expresses this heroic spirit in his repertoire, in addition to being dissatisfied with himself; he also faintly produced a reasonable complaint to the composers, no, it is expectation. He thought: the composers should also be invited to participate in this unusual concert....

"Let's sing that song about learning to speak like a stammerer!"

He sang one song after another in a high-pitched and enthusiastic voice, generously and without stinting his precious asset—his voice. He couldn't help but think of the situation when he sang in Beijing, at that time, as long as he had a performance in the evening, the leaders and comrades would definitely let him sleep during the day, and would not even let him attend meetings, for fear of tiring him out and not singing well in the evening. But today, he jumped off the cart and sang, even holding labor tools in his hand. Without accompaniment; and without the sound gathering equipment of a large theater, he sang even more loudly and enthusiastically, full of emotion. While wiping the sweat from his forehead, he thought to himself: "There must also be a great leap forward in performance work!" He could not conclude whether this concert of his counted as a leap forward, but he was sure of one thing, this was the most successful concert of his life.

Later, the facts proved this point:

After this concert, in the fields, during the peasants' rest, such concerts were often held. The programs also expanded from solos to chorus and violin, bassoon solos, etc. The peasants also developed a strong interest in these songs and performances. Now, as soon as they put on their earphones, they want to hear programs by their new commune members, and during the Spring Festival, they also write letters to the Central People's Broadcasting Station, requesting that they broadcast more programs sung and performed by the cadres of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra who have been sent to the countryside.

    “是老魏在唱……”
    刘大为
    夜，微风轻轻地敲打着门扉。
    妇女生产队长，挖了一天坑泥，晚饭，烧完最后一灶火劈柴，照例地盘着腿坐在热炕头上：一面纳着鞋底，一面习惯地从墙上摘下耳机子（矿石收音机上的）套在头上，这种习惯，差不多早就成为全村男女社员所共有的了。大家对节目的爱好也大体相同，除去新闻之外，差不多都喜欢听大戏、评戏；说实在的，她对耳机子里时常播送的交响乐、独唱、独奏节目，并没有引起过特别的注意，可是，今夜不同，当她刚一戴上耳机子，就被一个男高音的独唱吸引住了：
    “下一个节目，男高音独唱，
  ‘瓦夏之歌’。由中央乐团独唱演员魏鸣泉演唱”。
    妇女生产队长吃了一惊。大概是同名同姓吧，我们社下放干部里也有个叫魏鸣泉的同志，会是他唱吗？魏鸣泉平时在地里干活，说话的声调并不大，咋一唱起歌来声音这么大？当她再仔细的听下去的时候，她又继续听到了熟悉的名字：杨道先……对了，就是下放到十六队的，那个把头发剪得短短的女同志，赶情她唱的这么好听啊！还有刘奇的巴松独奏，她想：必是刘奇刚一来时背的那个玩意，长长的红红的像竹筒差不多。
    第二天，大家在休息的时候，都谈起昨夜耳机里播送的节目：
    “昨晚上，耳机子里有老魏他们唱歌呢？”
    “你说他学的急巴（口吃的人）唱歌，咋学的那像！”
    魏鸣泉背着粪笈子，跟着送坑泥的大车，来到了地头上，他放下粪笈子，跳上大车，汗流满面的从车上用铁铣往下卸坑泥，一刹时，大家兴高采烈的围上他，七言八语的对他说：
    “老魏，我们昨晚上，从耳机子里听到你唱歌了”
    “好，我们现在欢迎老魏来一段好不好？”田野上立即爆发了一片热烈的掌声。
    魏鸣泉跳下大车，一只手拿着铁铣；另一只手习惯地像靠在钢琴上那样，靠在大车沿上。多少年来，他在全国各大城市的舞台上、音乐厅里不止一次的演唱，接受过千百万观众的喝采和鲜花，可是像今天这样，面对着祖国的大自然，站在正向黄河、长江南岸跃进的田野上，给手拿锄头铁铣的农民弟兄姐妹演唱，这还是第一次，他怎能不激动？唱什么呢？不是他的节目不多，也不是怕农民不喜欢外国歌曲和抒情歌曲，而是他自己对他所拥有的保留节目产生了不满，当他现在站在这些跃进的人们面前要开始演唱的时候，他很自然的想起除夕之夜挖坑泥的夜战；就是这些人，大年初一还在田里劳动，为的是农业大跃进，为的是早日跨过黄河、越过长江！他要歌唱包括他自己在内的英雄行为。可是，在他保留节目中，怎么也搜寻不出表现这种英雄气概的歌曲，他除了对自己不满意之外；还隐隐约约地产生了对作曲家们的合理埋怨，不，是期望。他想：也应该请作曲家来参加一下这个不平常的音乐会……。
    “就唱那个学急巴说话的歌吧！”
    他高亢、热烈地唱完一支又唱一支，慷慨地毫不吝啬自己的宝贵财富——嗓子，他禁不住又想起来在北京演唱的情形，那时，只要晚上有他演出，领导上和同志们白天一定让他睡觉，连会议都不让他参加，怕累着，晚上唱不好。可是，今天，他跳下大车就唱，甚至手里还拿着劳动的工具。既无伴奏；又无大剧场的拢音设备，反倒唱得高亢哄亮，情绪饱满，他一面擦着额头上的汗珠，一面暗自在想：“在演唱工作上也要来个大跃进才行啊！”他这次音乐会算不算跃进，他不能下结论，可是有一点他肯定了，这是他生平最成功的一次音乐会。
    后来，事实证明了这点：
    从打这次音乐会之后，在田野上，农民休息的时候，就常常举行这种音乐会了，节目也由独唱扩展到齐唱和小提琴、巴松独奏等等。农民们也对这些歌唱和演奏产生了强烈的兴趣，现在，他们一戴上耳机子就想听到里面有他们新社员的节目，春节的时候，他们还要写信给中央广播电台，要求多播送一些中央乐团下放干部演唱、演奏的节目。
