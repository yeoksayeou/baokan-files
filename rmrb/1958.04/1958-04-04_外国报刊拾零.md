Foreign Press Clippings

	Self-Intoxication
	I understand that the government believes that if a high-level meeting is held in the United States, it will increase Khrushchev's domestic and international prestige. When will we end this nonsense of thinking and self-intoxication?
	Mr. Khrushchev already enjoys high prestige in the Soviet Union, and his international prestige is also increasing day by day. Khrushchev's prestige will certainly not be granted or deprived by a resolution in Washington.
		——American "Washington Post"

	Lament for the Decline of Social Mores
	There are more and more middle school hooligans. A middle school in Kawasaki City invited police to monitor the graduation ceremony on-site. It is said that there were about twenty hooligan students. It takes police to deal with twenty people. If there were fifty hooligan students, the Self-Defense Forces would have to be dispatched.
	It would be too naive to think that "moral education" can solve this problem. First of all, educational facilities need to be enriched. When the education budget is lower than the military budget, the hope of solving the problem is dim.
		——Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun"

    自我陶醉
    听说政府认为，如果在美国举行高级会议，就会增加赫鲁晓夫的国内和国际声望。什么时候我们才能结束这种胡闹的看法和自我陶醉呢？
    赫鲁晓夫先生在苏联已经享有高度声望，同时，他在国际上的声望也日益提高。赫鲁晓夫的声望，决非华盛顿一项决议就能赐予或加以剥夺的。
        ——美国“华盛顿邮报”
    世风日下之叹
    中学生的流氓行为越来越多了。川崎市有一所中学，请了警察来临场监视才举行了毕业典礼。据说，流氓学生约有二十人。对付二十人要用警察，如果有五十个流氓学生，就得出动自卫队了。
    如果以为“道德教育”可以解决这个问题，那就太天真了。首先需要充实教育设施。在教育预算低于军事预算的情况下，解决问题的希望是阴暗的。
          ——日本“每日新闻”
