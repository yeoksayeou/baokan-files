    Little Snippets from the Great Leap Forward

    Young Special-Class Labor Model
    In Zhengdian Township, Wuchang County, Hubei Province, Labor Cooperative No. 1 has an orphan named Ma Jiahe, who is 13 years old this year. In addition to going to school, he also participates in labor every day, earning more than 500 work points last year. He is skilled in handicrafts. The small tables and stools in his home were all made by him, and he repairs his own house. When the township built a reservoir, he also went to carry earth. In the first few days, his shoulders and feet ached from carrying, and he couldn't even carry 50 jin (25kg). He only earned four or five points a day. He thought, it would be great to have something to replace his shoulders and transport the soil. Thinking and thinking, he suddenly remembered the workers on Zhifang Street using handcarts to transport goods. He had an idea: Wouldn't it be good for me to make a small cart to push the earth? So he went home and made a dog-head cart with a wooden box himself and brought it to the construction site to push earth. He wasn't skilled at pushing the earth on the first day, and he accidentally veered into the ditch. But he was better on the second day. At the end of work, everyone gave him twelve points, more than double what he earned by carrying with his shoulders. When County Party Secretary Liang found out, he paid great attention to it. Everyone said that Ma Jiahe can push three dan (approx. 150kg) of earth in one trip, and we can push at least eight dan. If everyone does this, the project can be completed two months ahead of schedule. The headquarters promoted this method. Ma Jiahe was thus selected as a special-class labor model for water conservancy in Wuchang County.

    少年特等劳模
    湖北武昌县郑店乡劳动一社有一个孤儿，名叫马家和，今年13岁。他每天除上学外，还参加劳动，去年做了五百多个工分。他有一手好手艺，家里的小桌子、小凳子都是他做的，住房也由他自己修补。乡里修水库时，他也去挑土。头几天，他挑得肩痛脚痛，连五十斤都挑不动。一天只评四、五分。他想，要有个什么东西代替肩膀，把土运走才好。想呀想呀，突然想到纸坊街上的工人们用手推车运货，他心里一动：我也搞个小车来推土不好吗？他就回家自己动手，做了一辆带木盒的狗头车，带到工地上来推土。头一天推土不熟练，一不小心就歪到沟里去。第二天就好使了。收工时，大家给他评了十二分，比用肩挑提高了一倍多。县委梁书记知道以后，很是重视。大家说，马家和一趟能推三担土，我们至少能推八担，要是都这样干，工程可以提前两个月完成。指挥部推广了这个办法。马家和就这样被选为武昌县的水利特等劳动模范。
