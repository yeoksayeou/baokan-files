    Jiangxi An'yi Transforms Backward Fields
    In Baishu Agricultural Cooperative, Baishu Township, An'yi County, Jiangxi Province, there is a portion of backward fields with hard, yellowish soil, with an annual yield of only thirty to forty jin. The cooperative members were unwilling to cultivate it. This year, in order to realize a great leap forward in production, they are determined to transform the backward fields into advanced fields. After learning methods of soil improvement from the county agricultural technology station, the cooperative members spread rice husks in the backward fields to loosen the soil.

    江西安义改造落后田
    江西安义县柏树乡柏树农业社有一部分土壤坚硬带黄色的落后田，每年产量只有三、四十斤，社员们都不愿意耕种它。今年为实现生产大跃进，决心将落后田改成先进田。社员们从县里农业技术站学了改造土壤的法子后，在落后田里撒谷壳松土。
