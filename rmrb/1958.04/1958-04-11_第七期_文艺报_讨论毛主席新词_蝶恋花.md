Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The seventh issue of "Literary Gazette," to be published on the 11th, will have a special column discussing Chairman Mao's new poem "Butterfly Loves Flowers."

After the publication of the poet Zang Kejia's article "Joyfully Reading Chairman Mao's New Poem 'Butterfly Loves Flowers,'" his interpretation of the last two lines of "Butterfly Loves Flowers" aroused some different views in literary circles, so the "Literary Gazette" organized this discussion. Participants in the discussion included Guo Moruo, Zhang Guangnian, Xie Sijie, and others. Guo Moruo believes that the poem "Butterfly Loves Flowers" is "a typical combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism." Zhang Guangnian said that the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism in Chairman Mao's poetry is worth exploring, and doing so will surely inspire the creation of new poetry.

The "Literary Gazette" editorial department's call for submissions states: With the support and assistance of the Chinese Musicians Association, the "Literary Gazette" suggests that composers set Chairman Mao's published poems to music.

    第七期“文艺报”讨论毛主席新词“蝶恋花”
    据新华社10日讯　将在11日出版的第七期“文艺报”上辟专栏讨论了毛主席的新词“蝶恋花”。
    诗人臧克家的“喜读毛主席新词‘蝶恋花’”一文发表后，他对“蝶恋花”最后两句的解释在文学界引起了一些不同的看法，因而文艺报组织了这次讨论。参加讨论的有郭沫若、张光年、谢思洁等人。郭沫若认为“蝶恋花”一词是“革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义的典型的结合”，张光年说，毛主席诗词中的革命的现实主义同革命的浪漫主义的结合是很值得探讨的，这样做，对新诗歌的创作必将有所启发。
    “文艺报”编辑部的征稿启事说：“文艺报”在中国音乐家协会的支持和协助下，建议作曲家把毛主席已发表的诗词谱成歌曲。
