Give to Whoever Needs It Most Urgently
Heilongjiang Three Hundred Plus Units Mutually Adjust Materials

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 9th dispatch) At the Heilongjiang Province Materials Collaboration Great Leap Forward Conference recently convened, over one hundred factories and mines in Heilongjiang Province, took out some of the materials that were both scarce and essential for their own factories and mines to support fraternal enterprises in urgent need, resolving many key issues in major production and construction during the Great Leap Forward in production.

At the conference, the Engineering Company directly under the Ministry of Construction Engineering requested support of over 2,700 kilograms of whole silicon steel sheets. The material personnel of the Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory learned that these silicon steel sheets were used for overhauling a 40-ton portal crane, which was crucial to speeding up the construction progress of the Fularji Heavy Machinery Plant. Therefore, they immediately took out the silicon steel sheets, of which the factory itself was still feeling a shortage, to support the engineering company. The Fularji Thermal Power Plant expansion project needed twenty tons of angle steel. Every machinery factory and engineering company had this material, but all felt it was insufficient. In order to support this key project, the Northeast Third Engineering Company, Yichun Forestry Bureau, Harbin First Machinery Factory and other five units jointly supported this key project.

This kind of material support activity, starting from the overall situation, also solved the shortage of many special materials and accessories in the production and repair of old equipment in many factories. The Dong'an Machinery Factory had to halt production for six days due to the lack of special material—ferrochrome—needed to produce welding rods. After the Harbin First Industrial Bureau allocated 200 kilograms of ferrochrome, production was restored. The Qiqihar Lumber Mill had sent people to Shanghai and other places for the past six months to purchase bearings to replace the damaged bearings on its sawing machinery, but had not been able to buy any. This time, the Jixi Coal Mine also helped solve the problem.

At this conference, more than 300 industrial, mining, school and enterprise units signed contracts to mutually adjust materials, mutually adjusting steel, wood, bearings and other materials of various specifications, numbering over 1,000 types, worth more than 4.2 million yuan.

### 谁最急需就先给谁用  黑龙江三百多个单位互相调剂物资

    谁最急需就先给谁用
    黑龙江三百多个单位互相调剂物资
    本报哈尔滨9日电　黑龙江省一百多个厂矿，在最近召开的全省物资协作跃进大会上，把自己厂矿里既少又必需的材料物资，拿出一部分来支援火急需要的兄弟企业单位，解决了生产大跃进中许多重大生产和建设的关键问题。
    会上，建筑工程部直属工程公司要求支援二千七百多公斤的整块矽钢片，哈尔滨电机厂材料人员了解了这些矽钢片是用来大修四十吨写式起重机用的，对加快富拉尔基重型机器厂工程的施工进度有决定意义，所以立刻将自己工厂生产尚感不足的矽钢片拿出来支援这个工程公司。富拉尔基热电厂扩建工程需要二十吨角钢，这种材料每个机械工厂和工程公司都有，但是都感不足，为了支援这个重点工程，东北第三工程公司、伊春森林工业局、哈尔滨第一机械厂等五个单位，共同支援这个重点工程。
    这种从整体出发的物资支援活动，还解决了许多工厂生产和旧设备修配中缺少的许多特殊材料和配件。东安机械厂由于缺少生产电焊条用的特殊材料——铬铁，曾经停工六天，哈尔滨第一工业局给调剂二百公斤铬铁以后，才恢复了生产。齐齐哈尔制材厂为了替换锯木机械上损坏的轴承，半年来曾经派人到上海等地四处采购，都没有买到，这次也由鸡西煤矿帮助解决了。
    在这个会上共有三百多个工矿、学校企业单位签订互相调剂物资的合同，互相调剂钢材、木材、轴承等各种规格的材料有一千多种，价值四百二十多万元。
