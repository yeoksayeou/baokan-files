Xinhua News Agency, April 28th, dispatch from TASS, Kiev, April 27th: Comrade Khrushchev said in Kiev on the 26th that the Soviet Union will do everything possible to ensure that top-level talks are held, and that such talks promote the further normalization of the international situation and the establishment of greater trust between countries.

He added that we believe that not only the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have a stake in top-level talks, but all countries and governments that consider the opinions and will of the people have a stake in such talks. This is because talks between the heads of government of various countries have the potential to reach agreements on a series of unresolved issues, and the people of all countries hope to eliminate the state of cold war and consolidate world peace.

Khrushchev made these remarks at the award ceremony in the Kiev region. The region was awarded the Order of Lenin for its agricultural achievements last year.

In his speech, Khrushchev mentioned the recent talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France, saying that the Soviet government accommodated them because the ruling circles of these countries were unwilling to hold open negotiations on the preparations for top-level talks. They suggested adopting a typical diplomatic negotiation approach, hoping to isolate themselves from public opinion. The Soviet government also expressed its willingness to adopt this approach because, regardless of how these negotiations are conducted, the people of all countries can still discern where the truth lies.

Khrushchev refuted the fabrications by the bourgeois press that the Soviet Union had changed its position on the issue of top-level talks after it suggested to the United Nations Security Council that urgent measures be taken to stop American planes carrying nuclear weapons from flying towards the Soviet border. Khrushchev said that we appealed to the Security Council in order to take measures against those engaged in provocative activities. Our appeal was correctly understood by the people of all countries. As a result of this appeal, the United States is in a disgraceful position in the eyes of world public opinion.

A significant portion of Khrushchev's speech was an analysis of the agricultural situation in the Kiev region, the Ukrainian Republic, and the entire Soviet Union. He said that the Soviet Union has made great achievements in increasing livestock products. In the first quarter of this year, the total milk production in the Soviet Union increased by 14% compared with the same period last year. The average milk yield per cow in the Kiev region reached 2,786 kilograms last year, exceeding the average milk yield in countries such as the United States, Canada, France, and Austria. Khrushchev said that the phenomenon of economic crisis in capitalist countries is intensifying, while the Soviet economy is advancing with confidence.

    赫鲁晓夫谈高级会谈问题
    苏联将尽一切力量促会谈早日举行
    西方国家仍不愿公开进行筹备工作
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社基辅27日讯：赫鲁晓夫同志26日在基辅说，苏联将尽一切力量使最高级会谈得以举行，使最高级会谈促进国际局势的进一步正常化，促进各国之间建立更大的信任。
    他又说，我们认为，不仅苏联和其他社会主义国家同最高级会谈有利害关系，凡是考虑人民意见和意志的一切国家、一切政府都和这种会谈有利害关系。因为各国政府首脑的会谈有可能就一系列没有解决的问题达成协议，各国人民希望消除冷战状态，巩固世界和平。
    赫鲁晓夫是在基辅州的授勋大会上讲这些话的。这个州由于去年在农业方面的成就荣获列宁勋章。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中提到苏联外长葛罗米柯不久前同美、英、法三国大使举行的会谈说，苏联政府迁就他们，是因为这些国家的统治集团不愿意就最高级会谈的筹备工作举行公开谈判。他们建议采取典型的外交谈判方式，希望和舆论界隔绝起来。苏联政府也表示愿意采纳这种谈判方式，是因为不管这种谈判以怎样的方式进行，各国人民仍然可以分辨出真理的所在。
    赫鲁晓夫驳斥了资产阶级报刊捏造的说法：苏联在向联合国安全理事会建议采取紧急措施，来停止载有核武器的美国飞机向苏联边境飞行以后，似乎苏联就改变了在最高级会谈问题上的立场。赫鲁晓夫说，我们向安理会呼吁，是为了采取措施对付从事挑衅活动的人。我们的呼吁得到了世界各国人民的正确理解。由于这个呼吁，美国在世界公众的眼中处于不光采的地位。
    赫鲁晓夫的讲话有相当大一部分是分析基辅州、乌克兰共和国和整个苏联的农业状况。他说，苏联在增产畜牧业产品方面取得了很大成绩。今年第一季度苏联的牛奶总产量比去年同期增加了14％。基辅州每头奶牛的平均挤奶量在去年达到两千七百八十六公斤，超过了美国、加拿大、法国、奥地利这些国家的平均挤奶量。赫鲁晓夫说，资本主义国家经济危机现象在日益加剧，而苏联的经济正在满怀信心地前进。
