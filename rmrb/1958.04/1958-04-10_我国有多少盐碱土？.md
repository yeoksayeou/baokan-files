Small Statistics

    How much saline-alkali soil does China have?
    China has a very large area of saline-alkali soil. According to available data, the Northeast region (mainly the Songliao Plain) has approximately 120 million mu; the Bohai coastal area and the northern Jiangsu coastal area have approximately 90 million mu; and the North China region (scattered in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and other places) has approximately 8.6 million mu. Areas such as the Houtao area of Inner Mongolia, the Yellow River valley in Gansu, the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, and the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai also have large areas of saline-alkali soil, but there are no comprehensive figures.
    The vast majority of these saline-alkali soils are saline soils, with some interspersed saline-alkali soils or alkali soils.

    我国有多少盐碱土？
    我国盐碱土的面积很大，据已有资料估计，东北地区（主要是松辽平原）约有一亿二千万亩；渤海沿岸、苏北沿海地区约有九千万亩；华北地区（零星分布在河北、河南、山东、山西等地）约有八百六十万亩。内蒙古后套等地、甘肃黄河沿岸谷地、新疆塔里木盆地、青海柴达木盆地等地，也都有较大面积的盐碱土，但是没有全面数字。
    这些盐碱土绝大部分是盐土，部分间有盐碱土或碱土。
