Xinhua News Agency, April 21st. Wang Kunlun, the general commander of the sparrow eradication campaign in Beijing, announced to the city's people in a broadcast at 10:00 PM tonight that the campaign to encircle and suppress sparrows, with the entire capital mobilized and acting in unison, has concluded victoriously. According to incomplete statistics from the Beijing Sparrow Eradication Headquarters as of 12:00 AM tonight, a total of 400,160 sparrows were eliminated in the three days from the 19th to the 21st. In many areas, sparrows are no longer to be seen.

For these three days, the entire capital was in a frenzy, with an army of over three million workers, farmers, cadres, students, soldiers, and residents launching a fierce attack on sparrows. Every corner of the city was filled with combat sentries wielding "weapons." Even elderly women in their sixties and seventies and children aged five or six were banging and shooing with various noisemakers. Many leading cadres from government offices and teachers and students from universities also participated in the sparrow eradication activities. Over two thousand scientists and staff from the Chinese Academy of Sciences participated in the battle. Ornithologist Zheng Zuoxin both directed and shooed away sparrows. Scientists Hua Luogeng, Qian Xuesen, and others entered the "battle zone" with "weapons" before five o'clock this morning.

Before and after the start of the concentrated sparrow eradication campaign, the Beijing Sparrow Eradication Headquarters conducted extensive publicity and mobilization among the city's people. Many residents watched a film introducing the sparrow eradication efforts in Hedeng Township, Xinfan County, Sichuan. Broadcasting vehicles carrying dead sparrows drove through the streets, and people's combat enthusiasm soared as they saw the sparrows they had personally eliminated.

Based on the characteristics of sparrows' weak flying ability and low tolerance for hunger, the people of the capital adopted a comprehensive tactic of shooing, poisoning, shooting, and nest-raiding, and arranged specific steps and times for the operation. Every day, from early morning and from 4:00 PM to 7:30 PM, taking advantage of the sparrows' time to leave their nests to forage and return to their nests, the entire city acted in unison, concentrating on shooing them away. The sparrows had nowhere to land, could not find food, and could not drink water, becoming dizzy and exhausted, and dying of fatigue. Large numbers of sparrows were driven to "quiet" poison bait areas and shooting zones, where they died from poisoning and gunfire. After dusk, the sparrows that escaped the net entered their nests, and assault teams conducted nest-raiding and nest-blocking.

Wang Kunlun said in his broadcast tonight that after the nationwide concentrated sparrow eradication campaign comes to a temporary end, each district should learn from the experience of this concentrated sparrow eradication, pay constant attention to "enemy activity," and continue to use poisoning, shooting, and nest-raiding methods to continue to eliminate the remaining sparrows.

Sparrows Suffer Greatly, Granaries are Filled to the Brim
(A Small Statistic)

Beijing's large-scale sparrow eradication campaign has achieved great results. It is truly a case of "sparrows suffering greatly, granaries being filled to the brim." According to statistics from the Beijing Sparrow Eradication Headquarters, the elimination of 400,160 sparrows in three days, with each sparrow eating and wasting five jin of grain per year, can save 2,000,800 jin of grain. Furthermore, based on each pair of sparrows breeding fifteen offspring per year, another 15,043,500 jin of grain can be saved. Adding these amounts together, this grain can feed 56,831 people for a year (based on each person eating 300 jin of grain per year). (Attached picture)

    首都人民除四害战斗一大胜利
    三天歼灭麻雀四十万只
    新华社21日讯　北京市围剿麻雀总指挥王昆仑今晚十时在广播中向全市人民宣布：首都全民动员，一致行动围剿麻雀的战役胜利结束。据北京市围剿麻雀总指挥部截至今晚十二时为止的不完全统计：从19日至21日三天共消灭麻雀四十万零一千一百六十只。很多地区已经看不到麻雀。
    这三天，首都全城沸腾，由三百多万工人、农民、干部、学生、战士和居民组成的剿雀大军连日向麻雀猛攻猛打。全市各个角落都布满了手持“武器”的战斗岗哨。六、七十岁的老太太和五、六岁的孩子手里也拿着各种响器敲打轰赶。许多机关的领导干部和高等学校的师生也参加了剿雀活动。中国科学院有两千多科学家和工作人员参加了战斗。鸟类学家郑作新一面指挥一面轰赶。科学家华罗庚、钱学森等今天早晨不到五点就带着“武器”进入了“战区”。
    在突击围剿麻雀开始前后，北京市围剿麻雀总指挥部向全市人民进行了广泛的宣传动员。许多居民观看了介绍四川新繁县禾登乡围剿麻雀情况的电影。载着死麻雀的广播宣传车行驶在街头，人们看到他们亲手消灭的麻雀，战斗情绪更加高涨。
    根据麻雀飞行力和耐饿力很弱的特点，首都人民采取轰、毒、打、掏的综合战术，安排了作战的具体步骤和时间。每天清晨和下午四时到七时半，趁麻雀出窝觅食和回窝的时机，全市统一行动，集中轰赶。麻雀到处不能落脚，吃不着食喝不到水，累的晕头转向，疲惫而死。大批的麻雀被赶到“安静”的毒饵区和火枪歼灭区，都中毒、中弹死亡。傍晚以后，漏网的麻雀进了窝，由突击队进行掏窝、堵窝。
    王昆仑在今晚的广播中说，全民突击围剿麻雀的战斗暂时告一段落后，各区应吸取这次突击灭雀的经验，经常注意“敌情”，继续采用毒、打、掏的方法，继续消灭残余的麻雀。
    麻雀大遭殃　粮食省满仓
      （一个小统计）
    北京这次大举围剿麻雀取得的成绩很大。真是“麻雀大遭殃、粮食省满仓”。据北京市围剿雀总指挥部的统计，三天中消灭四十万零一千一百六十只麻雀，每只麻雀连吃带糟蹋的粮食每年按五斤计算，就可以节省粮食二百万零五千八百斤。又按每年每对麻雀繁殖十五只计算，又可节省了一千五百零四万三千五百斤粮食。把这些粮食加起来，可以供五万六千八百三十一人一年食用（按每人一年吃三百斤粮食计算）。（附图片）
