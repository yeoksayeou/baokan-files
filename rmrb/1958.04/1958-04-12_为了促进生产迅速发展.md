    To Promote Rapid Development of Production
    Our Correspondent Yang Yi
    A new plan for the reorganization of Czechoslovak industry and construction began on April 1st this year. This is a revolutionary measure taken by the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the people to strive for the construction of socialism in the short term, and an important method to improve the economic effectiveness of national economic management.
    The fundamental goal of the new principles of economic reorganization adopted by the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee plenum on February 25th is to make the organizational system and management of the national economy conform to the requirements of a rapidly growing economy; that is, to adjust certain links of the superstructure so that they are fully adapted to the economic base under the new situation, so as to promote the faster development of productive forces.
    Advantages of the New Economic Reorganization Plan
    The main advantages of the new plan are: First, it simplifies levels, abolishes and merges some institutions, frees the central competent departments from cumbersome and unrealistic affairs, enables them to be closer to production, grasp key links, and conduct more effective leadership in economic construction. In the past, central departments generally led 70 to 150 enterprises. After the reorganization, they will lead an average of only 25 to 30 economic production units, and these are all large enterprises that can independently solve production problems. Second, it has delegated a large part of power, abolished local economic departments; the responsibilities and powers of local people's committees and new economic production units have been expanded, which is conducive to the发挥 of their enthusiasm, and also conducive to cooperation between enterprises and technological innovation. Third, by streamlining institutions and delegating cadres, on the one hand, the quality of cadres and the efficiency of government work have been improved, and administrative expenses have been reduced; on the other hand, areas and departments with a serious shortage of labor have obtained new human resources. Fourth, the expansion of enterprise authority also creates prerequisites for the working people to better directly participate in production management, which helps to improve enterprise management and发挥 the enthusiasm of workers in production; the new plan also clearly guarantees the strengthening of the leadership and supervision role of enterprise party organizations and trade unions. Fifth, the reform of the current planning and financial system and the implementation of the material reward system can better promote enterprises and workers to improve the economic effectiveness of production.
    Intense Preparatory Work
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of economic reorganization, the Czechoslovak government held several meetings in March and took a series of specific measures. In order to enable the new economic production units to start work on April 1, the meeting stipulated that the handover between the old and new units should be completed before March 25. Because, all enterprises must immediately devote themselves to production after the reorganization, and comprehensively and balancedly complete this year's production tasks. The Czechoslovak government also requires all enterprises to formulate their own annual production and financial plans in the first half of April and submit them to the leadership for approval before April 20. In this way, all tasks related to the reorganization can be completed before the end of April.
    Adjustment of Central Department Institutions and Personnel
    According to the resolutions of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee and the instructions of government meetings, the central production departments have been working intensively on institutional reorganization and personnel adjustment.
    The original 386 enterprises in the Czech part of the Ministry of Food Industry and Agricultural Product Procurement will be reorganized into 25 economic production units, directly led by the ministry, including 15 joint enterprises and 10 joint organizations, all of which are merged or united by factories in the entire industry. Only two of the original 14 research institutions are now retained, and the rest are attached to various joint enterprises and joint organizations. After the reorganization, the Ministry of Food Industry system can reduce 7,800 management and technical personnel, and save 9 million crowns in wages alone each year.
    The Ministry of Heavy Machinery Industry will have 23 economic production units after the reorganization, in addition to eight research institutes, and the number of management personnel can be reduced by 60%. The largest enterprises in this ministry are the famous Lenin Factory and the Czech Kad Prague Factory; the joint organization for the production of metal cutting machines and tools is also formed by the joint efforts of 23 independent manufacturers across the country. They can all produce complete sets of machinery and equipment.
    The Ministry of Fuel Industry will be divided into three production systems: coal mining, oil and natural gas, and gas. These three aspects include five joint organizations and two joint enterprises, such as the 21 enterprises in the Ostrava coal area, the main producing area of hard coal, which are combined into a joint organization. Three joint enterprises are established separately for fuel enterprises in the Slovak region. The management organization of the entire fuel industry system will delegate 2,000 staff members.
    There were originally 2,788 industrial enterprises in Czechoslovakia. After the reorganization, there are 344 economic production units, including 276 joint enterprises and 68 joint organizations.
    Reorganization and Planning Simultaneously
    In order to welcome the upcoming reorganization, many enterprises have established special committees since the beginning of the year to be responsible for formulating the organizational principles and work plans of the new enterprises. Recently, various enterprises have been holding a series of meetings and carrying out various activities to prepare for the reorganization. The states are also holding cadre meetings to discuss industrial reorganization issues, and representatives from party organizations, trade unions, and economic workers in various factories are participating in the meetings to make decisions on the specific arrangements for the reorganization and how to better ensure the completion of the first quarter production plan from an organizational perspective.
    It is naturally not an easy task to complete the merger and union of thousands of enterprises in a very short period of time. The plans and budgets of various enterprises need to be recalculated, some national laws and regulations need to be revised accordingly, the relationship between enterprises needs to be adjusted, some central departments will have to cut or merge more than 50% of their staff to be resettled, and so on. The completion of these tasks depends on the joint efforts of the entire party and the entire people.
    In order to enable the new organization to smoothly achieve the mission of improving the effectiveness of the national economy, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government have called for efforts to improve the work level of economic organs at all levels, requiring economic leaders to have a broad political vision and profound economic insights, to correctly handle the relationship between national interests and local interests, and to overcome the dangerous tendency of simply pursuing material rewards and only taking care of the interests of the local area and unit. The Czechoslovak Communist Party has also sounded the alarm to cadres, urging them to prevent possible conservative tendencies, and opposing the erroneous attitude of seeking comfort and not daring to face new things. Because this year's production tasks are very heavy, the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government have especially emphasized that the new economic production units cannot relax their daily production tasks in the slightest, and various enterprises must quickly carry out normal production and strive to become advanced production units in the first year.
    The economic reorganization plan is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Czechoslovak working people, and it has undergone extensive discussions by millions of working people for more than two months. This new plan meets the actual needs of Czechoslovakia today. The new plan has prepared the prerequisites for improving the effectiveness of the national economy. The key to whether the new measures can be implemented smoothly lies in whether the enthusiasm of the broad working class to participate in production and manage production is well发挥.
    The Role of the Party and Trade Union is Greatly Strengthened
    The implementation of the new plan also puts higher demands on party organizations at all levels and all party members, requiring them to better embody the party's leadership and supervision role in the economy, strengthen political and ideological education for the masses, safeguard the overall interests of the country, adhere to the socialist management principles of enterprises, and stop economic organs from violating the erroneous behaviors of social interests.
    The implementation of economic reorganization has also greatly enhanced the role of trade unions. Trade unions must become the main responsible persons and direct organizers for mobilizing the working people to participate in economic management. The Presidium of the Central Council of Czechoslovak Trade Unions recently held a meeting to discuss how to politically and organizationally ensure the implementation of new measures. The Central Trade Union called on trade union organizations at all levels to carry out socialist emulation and strive for the smooth realization of economic reorganization.
    The new plan for the reorganization of industry and construction has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the Czechoslovak working class. Since last winter, production in some departments and regions has increased significantly compared to before. The implementation of the new economic reorganization plan will undoubtedly further accelerate the pace of socialist construction in Czechoslovakia.

    为了促进生产迅速发展
    本报记者　杨翊
    今年4月1日起，捷克斯洛伐克工业和建筑业改组的新方案就开始实行了。这是捷克斯洛伐克共产党和人民为争取短期内建成社会主义而采取的革命性措施，是提高国民经济管理工作经济效果的重要方法。
    2月25日捷共中央全会通过的经济改组新原则的根本目标，是使国民经济的组织系统和管理工作符合迅速增长的经济的要求；也就是调整上层建筑的某些环节，使之与新形势下的经济基础完全适应，以促进生产力的更快发展。
    经济改组新方案的优点
    新方案的主要优点在于：第一，它简化了层次，废除和合并了一部分机构，使中央主管部门从繁琐的、脱离实际的事务工作中解脱出来，有条件更接近生产，抓住关键性环节，对经济建设进行更有效的领导。从前中央部门一般领导七十到一百五十个企业，改组后平均只领导二十五到三十个经济生产单位，而且这些都是能独立解决生产问题的大企业。第二，它下放了很大一部分权力，撤消了地方经济部；地方人民委员会和新经济生产单位的责任与职权都扩大了，有利于它们积极性的发挥，也有利于企业间的协作和技术的革新。第三，通过精简机构和下放干部，一方面提高了干部质量与机关工作效率，紧缩了行政经费的支出；一方面使严重缺乏劳动力的地区和部门，获得了新的人力补充。第四，企业权限的扩大也为劳动人民更好地直接参加生产管理创造了前提，有助于改善企业经营和发挥职工生产积极性；新方案也明确保证了企业党组织和工会的领导与监督作用的加强。第五，现行计划和财务制度的改革，物质奖励制度的实施，能更好推动企业和职工提高生产的经济效果。
    紧张的准备工作
    为了保证经济改组工作的顺利进行，在3月份里捷克斯洛伐克政府举行了多次会议，采取了一系列具体措施。为使新的经济生产单位能在4月1日开始工作，会议规定新旧单位的交接工作要在3月25日以前完成。因为，一切企业在改组后必须立即全力投入生产，全面地、均衡地完成今年生产任务。捷克斯洛伐克政府也要求各个企业在4月上半月订出自己的年度生产和财务计划，并在4月20日前提交领导批准。这样，有关改组的各项工作就能在4月底以前全部完成。
    中央各部门机构和人员的调整
    根据捷共中央决议和政府会议指示，中央各生产部门紧张地进行了机构改组和人员调整工作。
    食品工业和农产品采购部原在捷克部分的三百八十六个企业将改组成二十五个经济生产单位，直接由部领导，其中包括十五个联合企业和十个联营机构，都是由整个行业的工厂合并或联合而成的。原有的十四个研究机关现也只留下两个，其余的都附属到各个联合企业和联营机构中去。食品工业部系统经改组后，可减少七千八百个管理和技术人员，每年仅是工资一项就可节省九百万克朗。
    重型机器工业部改组后将拥有二十三个经济生产单位，此外还有八个研究所，管理人员可减少60％。这个部最大的企业是有名的列宁工厂和捷卡德布拉格工厂；生产金属切削机器和工具的联营机构也是由全国各地二十三个独立的制造厂联合组成的。它们都能生产成套的机器设备。
    燃料工业部将分成三个生产系统，这就是：采煤，石油与天然煤气和煤气。这三个方面包括五个联营机构和两个联合企业，如硬煤主要产地的俄斯特拉发煤区的二十一个企业就合组成一个联营机构。斯洛伐克地区的燃料企业另成立三个联合企业。整个燃料工业系统的管理机构下放二千个工作人员。
    捷克斯洛伐克全国原有二千七百八十八个工业企业，改组后是三百四十四个经济生产单位，其中有二百七十六个联合企业和六十八个联营机构。
    改组和定计划同时进行
    为了迎接即将到来的改组，从年初开始，许多企业都成立了专门委员会，负责拟定新企业的组织原则和工作计划。最近，各个企业都在举行一连串的会议，进行各种活动，为改组作准备。各州也正在召开讨论工业改组问题的干部会议，各工厂的党组织、工会和经济工作人员的代表参加会议，就改组的具体安排以及如何使这种改革更好地从组织上保证第一季度生产计划完成等问题作出决定。
    要在很短时期内完成数千个企业的合并和联合，自然不是一件轻而易举的事。各个企业的计划和预算都需要重新计算，国家某些法律和规定需要进行相应的修改，企业之间的关系需要调整，一些中央部门将要裁撤或合并50％以上的工作人员要重新安置等等。这些任务的完成都有赖于全党和全体人民的共同努力。
    为了使新的组织能顺利达到提高国民经济效果的使命，捷共和政府已号召努力提高各级经济机关的工作水平，要求经济领导人员具有远大的政治眼光和深刻的经济见解，能正确处理国家利益和局部利益之间的关系，克服单纯追求物质奖励和只顾本地、本单位利益的危险倾向。捷共也已向干部敲起警钟，要防止可能出现的保守倾向，反对贪图安逸和不敢正视新事物的错误态度。因为今年生产任务很重，捷共和政府特别强调新经济生产单位不能丝毫放松日常生产任务，各个企业必须迅速进行正常生产，争取在第一年内就成为先进生产单位。
    经济改组方案是捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民集体智慧的结晶，它经过成百万劳动人民为期两个多月的广泛讨论。这个新方案符合捷克斯洛伐克今天的实际需要。新方案已经为提高国民经济效果准备了前提，新的措施能否顺利实施，关键在于是否很好地发扬了广大工人阶级参加生产和管理生产的积极性。
    党和工会的作用大大加强
    新方案的施行也对各级党组织和全体党员提出了更高的要求，要求他们更好地体现党在经济中的领导和监督作用，加强对群众的政治思想教育，维护国家整体利益，坚持企业的社会主义管理原则，制止经济机关违反社会利益的错误行为。
    经济改组的实施，也使工会作用大为增强，工会必须成为动员劳动人民参加经济管理的主要负责人和直接组织者。捷克斯洛伐克工会中央理事会主席团日前开会讨论了如何在政治上和组织上保证实行新措施的问题，工会中央号召各级工会组织开展社会主义竞赛，为经济改组的顺利实现而斗争。
    工业和建筑业改组的新方案大大鼓舞了捷克斯洛伐克工人阶级的干劲。去冬以来，一些部门和地区的生产都较前有了显著增长。经济改组新方案的实施无疑地将进一步加快捷克斯洛伐克社会主义建设的步伐。
