    “Three Loves Day” and Mass Self-Education
    Tian Linmao
    In order to consolidate the achievements of the rectification campaign, many agricultural cooperatives, based on the opinions of the masses, have established patriotic, love-the-collective, and love-the-family covenants (referred to as the "Three Loves Covenant," and some as "Two Loves" or "Four Loves" covenants). Some have even stipulated that there be a "Three Loves Day" every half month or month to check the implementation of the covenants. This is a very meaningful thing. It is a form of self-education for the masses.
    In dealing with production and distribution issues, there are some contradictions between the state, agricultural cooperatives, and their members. This is mainly because some members only care about their private interests and disregard the interests of the collective, or only care about the interests of the collective and neglect the overall interests of the state. Sometimes they do not implement national policies or accept national plans. Through the activities of "Three Loves Day," continuously conducting mass education and criticism of these people can gradually raise the masses' ideological awareness of patriotism and collectivism, leaving no hiding place for capitalism and other bad thoughts and behaviors. This is a good way to handle contradictions among the people.
    Some people believe that after the great debate on the two roads, the masses' awareness has been generally raised, and ideological and political work seems to be able to be relaxed a bit. This view is incorrect. Through socialist education and rectification in rural areas, evil trends have been cracked down upon, and capitalist and individualistic thoughts have been criticized, and the masses' awareness has indeed been raised. However, this does not mean that all ideological problems have been completely resolved, and contradictions no longer exist. The transformation of old ideas is by no means a matter of a day or two, or a single movement. The establishment of new ideas can be based on a major movement, but it cannot completely and permanently solve the problem. The current production upsurge has diluted some contradictions, and capitalist and individualistic thoughts dare not raise their heads, but they have not been eradicated in reality. Moreover, even if these problems are completely resolved, incorrect ideas will still be revived if education is not continued. Some agricultural cooperatives had established Patriotic and Love-the-Collective Days before the realization of advanced cooperativization. However, after the realization of advanced cooperativization, the Party branch believed that the masses' awareness had been raised and that there was no need to carry out political and ideological education any further, and thus the Patriotic and Love-the-Collective Day activities were once suspended. During this period, the contradiction between individual interests and collective interests was exposed again: the phenomenon of members not paying attention to quality in their work and not cherishing collective property occurred frequently. These facts show that political and ideological work cannot be relaxed at the present stage.

    “三爱日”和群众自我教育
    田林茂
    为了巩固整风成果，不少农业社根据群众的意见，订立了爱国、爱社、爱家公约（简称三爱公约，也有的是双爱或四爱公约），有的还规定半月或者一月有一次三爱日，检查公约执行情况。这是一件很有意义的事情。这是群众进行自我教育的一种形式。
    在处理生产和分配的问题上，国家、农业社和社员之间是存在着一些矛盾的。这主要是由于某些社员只顾私人利益，不顾社的利益，或者是只顾社的利益，忽视了国家的整体利益。有时他们不执行国家的政策，不接受国家的计划。通过三爱日的活动，对这些人不断进行群众性的教育和批评，便可逐步提高群众的爱国主义和集体主义的思想觉悟，使资本主义和其他不好的思想行为无处藏身。这是处理人民内部矛盾的一个好办法。
    有人认为，经过两条道路的大辩论，群众觉悟已经普遍提高，思想政治工作似乎可以放松一些了。这种看法是不对的。农村中经过社会主义教育和整风整社，打击了歪风邪气，批判了资本主义和个人主义思想，群众觉悟是提高了；但这并不等于思想问题已经全部解决，矛盾已经不复存在。旧思想的转变，绝不是一朝一夕或者一个运动的事。新思想的树立，可以经过一次大运动打下基础；但却不能全部地永远地解决问题。目前的生产高潮冲淡了某些矛盾，资本主义和个人主义思想不敢抬头，实际上并没有根绝。而且，即使这些问题完全解决了，如果不继续地进行教育，不正确的思想也还会死灰复燃。有些农业社在实现高级合作化以前曾经建立了爱国爱社日，但是在实现高级合作化以后，党支部认为群众觉悟已经提高，不需要再进行政治思想教育了，因而一度停止了爱国爱社日的活动。在这期间，个人利益和集体利益的矛盾又暴露出来了：社员做活不讲质量，不爱护集体财产的现象不断发生。这些事实，说明政治思想工作在目前阶段决不能放松。
