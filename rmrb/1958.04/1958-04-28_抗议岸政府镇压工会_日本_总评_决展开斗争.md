Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th - The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) decided on the 26th to advance its second "May Day" Labor Day celebration, originally scheduled for May 21st, to May 17th, in protest against the government's brutal suppression of trade unions. On this day, various trade unions will simultaneously hold protest rallies.

The Japan Teachers' Union held an emergency meeting of its Central Struggle Committee on the evening of the 26th, expressing its intention to protest the political persecution carried out by the Japanese police against the Teachers' Union and its cadres, and will demand compensation for losses.

The Japan Teachers' Union recently mobilized its 550,000 members to launch a struggle against the Kishi Nobusuke government's implementation of the "performance rating" system to control teachers and the policy of reviving militarist education. They held large-scale protest rallies and conducted leave-taking struggles throughout the country. The Kishi Nobusuke government, facing the general election to be held on May 22, is using the Teachers' Union's struggle, alleging that it is suspected of violating the so-called "Local Public Service Law," to suppress it.

Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of Sohyo, pointed out that the suppression of Japanese teachers is a campaign tactic of the government and the Liberal Democratic Party, and that, like the illegal punishment of cadres of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union and the National Telecommunications Workers' Union, the aim is to suppress the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan.

He said that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will resolutely launch a struggle to protest the government's political suppression of trade unions, and through the election struggle, overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

    抗议岸政府镇压工会
    日本“总评”决展开斗争
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会26日决定把原定在5月21日举行的庆祝“五一”劳动节的第二次活动提前在5月17日举行，以抗议政府镇压工会的暴行。在这一天，各工会将同时举行抗议大会。
    日本教职员工会在26日傍晚举行了中央斗争委员会紧急会议，表示要抗议日本警察对教职员工会和它的干部进行的政治迫害，并且将要求赔偿损失。
    日本教职员工会最近动员了它的五十五万会员展开斗争，反对岸信介政府推行控制教职员的“勤务评定”制度和复活军国主义教育的政策。他们在全国范围内举行了声势浩大的抗议大会和进行请假斗争。岸信介政府面临5月22日就要举行的大选，借口教职员工会的斗争有违反所谓“地方公务员法”的嫌疑，对它进行镇压。
    “总评”事务局局长岩井章指出，对日本教职员进行镇压，是政府和自由民主党进行竞选的策略，这和非法处分全递信从业员工会和全国电气通信工会的干部一样，目的都是要镇压日本工会总评议会。
    他说，日本工会总评议会要坚决展开斗争，抗议政府对工会的政治镇压，并且通过竞选斗争，打倒岸信介政府。
