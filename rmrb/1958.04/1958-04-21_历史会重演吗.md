    Will History Repeat Itself?
    Zhang Zhenya
    The dark clouds of economic crisis are gathering ever more densely over Washington. In the past eight months, the decline in U.S. industrial production and the increase in unemployment have exceeded the scope of the two partial crises of 1948-1949 and 1953-1954. The U.S. President's optimistic tone has become subdued. The White House economic advisors look dejected. Americans are anxiously asking each other: will the 1929 crisis repeat itself in 1958? The Americans' panic is by no means without reason. If one revisits the history of 1929, one will find that the current U.S. economic crisis, whether in its background or in Washington's approach to the crisis, is somewhat like a re-enactment of the story of twenty-eight years ago.
    The fixed capital investment boom that began in 1921 and lasted for nearly a decade was the material foundation that led to the Great Crisis of 1929, just as the fixed capital investment boom of nearly twelve years after World War II is the material foundation for this crisis. At that time, also in a situation where the Western European imperialist countries were weakened by the war, American overseas investment and trade rapidly expanded, and the profits of large companies created new records year after year. The proportion of domestic fixed capital investment in the gross national product increased year by year. The investment boom brought full employment, and a scene of prosperity appeared throughout the country. Automobiles, steel, housing construction... just like after this war, became the pillars supporting economic prosperity on the basis of credit expansion. In 1926, two-thirds of the total sales of new cars in the United States were installment sales, which is the same as this time.
    At that time, American big business owners and bourgeois apologists also cheered, just like those "American capitalist exceptionalists" not long ago: "America has found the road to permanent prosperity." The then U.S. President Herbert Hoover declared in his inaugural address on March 4, 1929: "Americans have come nearer to the final triumph over poverty than any nation in history." But seven months later, the economic crisis storm triggered by the sharp decline in New York stock market prices blew these words away as historical jokes.
    The long-gestating crisis attacked the United States with the force of a thunderbolt. The wave of stock selling on the New York Stock Exchange that began on October 24, 1929, reached its peak on October 29. On that day, more than 16 million shares of stock were willing to be sold at any price on the market (the New York Stock Exchange normally trades an average of just over 2 million shares per day). As a result, stock prices collapsed overnight. Commercial banks, companies, and individuals who had desperately engaged in stock speculation with loans due to rising profits went bankrupt because they held a large number of stocks. What followed was a large number of banks, companies, and businesses collapsing under the dual impact of the production surplus crisis and the credit crisis, followed by a large number of unemployed.
    In the most severe first four years of that crisis, about 5,760 banks closed; iron production decreased by 79.4%, steel production decreased by 76%, automobile production decreased by 80%... The total value of industrial production decreased from around $70 billion to $31 billion. The number of unemployed increased from 2.6 million to 17 million (equal to one-third of the then employed population). During this period, due to capitalists taking the opportunity to lower wages, the total amount of wages nationwide dropped sharply from $11.5 billion per year to $5 billion. Millions of workers lived on the starvation line. Many unemployed people starved to death. Tens of thousands of men, women, and children were forced to live in holes in the ground and shacks made of scrap metal. Others traveled aimlessly along the railways. Soup kitchens and queues for relief bread were all over the country... During these four years, the loss to the U.S. national economy reached $260 billion, equivalent to the devastation of a war.
    Just like before the outbreak of this crisis, more than a year before the outbreak of that Great Crisis, signs of excessive credit expansion, market contraction, and excessive corporate inventories had already appeared. The decline in production in the powerful capital goods industrial sector, which preceded that crisis, actually began in the spring of 1929, just as in this economic crisis, the production of the capital goods industrial sector began to decline eight months before the crisis broke out last year.
    Sensing this danger, the Federal Reserve Board also began to tighten credit in 1928 to prevent excessive credit expansion, just as it had done in the two years before this crisis. But the effect was also the same as the result of this policy implemented in the U.S. economy in the past two years: it failed. By the eve of the 1929 crisis, U.S. public and private debt had expanded to be equal to one-third of the national wealth at that time, 217% of the national income (from the end of 1956 to the present, U.S. public and private debt has also generally remained at a level exceeding one time the national income).
    Due to the excessive expansion of productivity and the increasing concentration of wealth in the hands of a few caused by long-term investment booms, the shrinking market increasingly relied on artificial credit to maintain it. But when credit expands to a certain saturation point and cannot continue, an inevitable crisis breaks out. And this is the common cause that led to these two crises. The only difference is that the 1929 crisis had a more serious speculative nature, so the scale and intensity it showed were particularly terrible.
    After the outbreak of the 1929 economic crisis, U.S. President Hoover made a speech and took countermeasures to deal with the crisis. But surprisingly, his speech and countermeasures are exactly the same as Eisenhower's actions today.
    Hoover and his Secretary of State Mellon also made optimistic predictions, saying after the outbreak of the crisis that "the U.S. economy is basically healthy," and also predicted that "a large-scale prosperity is just around the corner."
    When the reality increasingly contradicted Hoover's predictions, this "Hunger President" (a nickname Hoover gained because of this crisis) also gave the American people a guarantee like Eisenhower: "The economic crisis will turn around in March, and will pass after another sixty days (i.e., the end of May)." The then U.S. Secretary of State Mellon also pretended and said that he "couldn't see anything in the economy that would make people pessimistic."
    The countermeasures Hoover took to deal with the crisis, apart from expanding armaments and preparing for war, are exactly the methods that Eisenhower has already taken and is preparing to take today. From the outbreak of the crisis, Hoover ordered the Federal Reserve Board to relax credit, lower interest rates, and implemented tax cuts in November of that year. Later, he asked Congress to allocate funds to build highways, public buildings, flood control, and build airports, especially organizing a "Revival Finance Corporation" to concentrate efforts to rescue those railway companies, banks, insurance companies, and large enterprises that were about to go bankrupt. But all these measures had no effect on the development of the crisis. However, the federal government's finances were on the verge of bankruptcy due to the depletion of financial resources and various continuous relief expenditures. In 1932, federal fiscal revenue even only reached 50% of expenditures. After this astonishing deficit appeared, members of Congress exclaimed that the budget must be balanced first. So after implementing tax cuts, Hoover hurriedly signed a tax increase bill in June 1932. But with soaring debt and a heavy burden of interest on the national treasury, it was actually impossible to balance the budget. Although Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard and implemented the devaluation of the dollar after he came to power in 1933 to save the collapsing finances, the debt of the U.S. federal government continued to rise. By June 30, 1936, the U.S. national debt was as high as $40 billion, nearly one and a half times higher than the total national debt when Hoover came to power.
    During this period, Roosevelt carried out various large-scale public works and relief programs, the expenditure figures of which far exceeded the scale of Eisenhower's expenditure today, but the number of unemployed people always remained at a level of more than 10 million. In the second half of 1937, a fierce economic crisis struck the United States again. As a result, the slightly recovered U.S. economy once again fell into the abyss of crisis. It was not until the outbreak of World War II that the wartime boom freed the U.S. economy from a long-term recession.
    Today, Washington's decision-makers are basically still using the old weapons used by Hoover and Roosevelt to fight the new crisis. Due to the strengthening of U.S. state monopoly capitalism after the war, the development and manifestation of this crisis are somewhat different from the 1929 crisis. But in terms of the causes of the crisis, the two are basically the same. Therefore, whether the Eisenhower government will repeat Hoover's mistakes, it seems that even the White House decision-makers have no confidence. Facing the federal finances that are already breathless under the pressure of military spending, isn't Eisenhower's hesitation on the issue of tax cuts precisely out of fear of repeating Hoover's story of cutting taxes and then increasing taxes twenty-eight years ago?

    历史会重演吗
    张振亚
    经济危机的黑云在华盛顿上空越聚越浓密了。八个月来，美国工业生产下跌和失业人数增长的幅度已超过1948—1949年和1953—1954年两次局部性的危机。美国总统的乐观论调低沉了。白宫经济顾问们的神色沮丧了。美国人惴惴不安地在竞相走问：1929年的危机是否会在1958年重演？美国人这样惊慌不安绝不是没有缘故的。人们如果重翻一下1929年的历史，就会发现美国今天的经济危机无论在它发生的背景上或是在华盛顿对待危机的方法上，竟有点像在重演二十八年前的故事。
    从1921年开始的长达近十年的固定资本投资景气是导致1929年大危机的物质基础，正像二次大战后近十二年的固定资本投资景气是这次危机的物质基础一样。当时也是在西欧各帝国主义国家被战争削弱的情况下，美国海外投资和贸易迅速扩充，大公司利润年复一年地创造新纪录。国内固定资本投资在国民生产总值中所占的比例逐年上升。投资景气带来了充分就业，全国出现了一片繁荣景象。汽车、钢铁、住房建筑……正像这次战后一样，在信贷膨胀的基础上成为支持经济繁荣的支柱。1926年美国新汽车的总销售量中有三分之二属于分期付款赊销，情况正和这次相同。
    当时，美国大企业主和资产阶级辩护士们也像不久以前那些“美国资本主义例外论”者一样地欢呼：“美国已找到永久繁荣的道路”。当年的美国总统赫伯特·胡佛在1929年3月4日的就职演说中宣称：“美国人在历史上已比任何国家更接近于最后战胜贫困。”但是七个月之后，由纽约股票市场价格狂跌所触发的经济危机大风暴就把这些话作为历史笑料吹得无影无踪了。
    长久孕育着的危机以雷霆万钧之势袭击了美国。1929年10月24日开始的纽约股票市场抛售股票浪潮在10月29日达到最高峰。那天市场上竟有一千六百多万股股票愿意以任何价格脱手（纽约股票市场平常每天平均只交易二百多万股）。于是股票价格一夜之间就宣告崩溃。那些由于利润上升拚命以借贷来从事股票投机的商业银行、公司和私人由于手中握有大量股票而破产了。接着而来的是遭到生产过剩危机和信用危机双重打击的银行、公司、商号大量倒闭，跟着大量失业队伍也出现了。
    在那次危机最重严的头四年中，约有五千七百六十多家银行倒闭；铁减产79.4％，钢减产76％，汽车减产80％……。工业生产总值从七百亿美元左右下降到三百一十亿美元。失业人数则从二百六十万人增加到一千七百万人（等于当时就业人数的三分之一）。在这段时期中，由于资本家乘机压低工资，全国工资的总数从每年一百一十五亿美元急剧下降到五十亿美元。千百万工人生活在饥饿线上。许多没有工作的人饿死了。成千成万的男男女女和儿童，被迫住在地洞和洋铁皮的棚屋里。另外一些人则沿着铁路线作毫无目的的旅行。粥厂和候领救济面包的队伍则遍及全国……。在这四年中美国国民经济的损失达两千六百亿美元，等于经历了一次战争的浩劫。
    正和这次危机爆发前一样，在那次大危机爆发以前的一年多，信贷的过度膨胀、市场的萎缩和企业存货过多的迹象就已经出现。作为那次危机的先行的强大资本货工业部门生产的下降，实际上在1929年春天就已开始，正像在这次经济危机中资本货工业部门的生产早在去年危机爆发前八个月便开始下降一样。
    觉察到这种危险的联邦储备委员会当时也像它在这次危机前两年所采取的行动一样，在1928年便开始紧缩信贷来防止信贷过度膨胀。但是效果也正同近两年这一政策在美国经济中实施的结果一样，是失败了。到1929年危机前夕，美国公私债务竟扩大到等于当时国民财富的三分之一，国民收入的217％（从1956年底到现在，美国公私债务大体上也保持于超过国民收入一倍的水平）。
    由于长期投资景气所造成的生产力过度扩张和财富的愈益集中于少数人手中，因此萎缩的市场就越来越依靠人为的信贷来维持。但是当信贷膨胀到一定的饱和点不能再继续下去的时候，无可避免的危机就爆发了。而这正是导致这两次危机的共同原因。不同的只不过是1929年的危机带有更严重的投机性质，因此所表现的规模和猛烈程度就格外可怕罢了。
    在1929年经济危机爆发之后，美国总统胡佛发表了谈话，并采取了应付危机的对策。但是令人惊奇的是，他的谈话和对策竟和艾森豪威尔今天的作为如出一辙。
    胡佛和他的国务卿梅隆同样发表了乐观的预测，在危机爆发之后仍说：“美国经济基本上是健康的”，并同样预言：“一个大规模的繁荣就在眼前。”
    当现实情况同胡佛的预测越来越背道而驰的时候，这位“饥饿总统”（胡佛因这次危机而获得的绰号）也像艾森豪威尔一样向美国人民打出了保票：“经济危机在3月份就会回转，再过六十天以后（即5月底）就会过去”。当时的美国国务卿梅隆也装模作样地说，他“看不出经济中有任何值得人们悲观的地方”。
    胡佛当时所采取的应付危机的对策，除了扩军备战一项之外，也正是今天艾森豪威尔所已采取的和准备采取的办法。从危机爆发时起，胡佛就命令联邦储备委员会放宽信贷，降低利率，并在那年11月实行了减税，以后又要求国会拨款来兴建公路、公共建筑、防洪、修建机场，特别是组织了一个“复兴金融公司”集中力量对那些行将倒闭的铁路公司、银行、保险公司、大企业进行救济。但是所有这些措施对危机的发展都不发生作用。而联邦政府的财政却因财源枯竭和各种源源不断的救济支出濒临破产境地。1932年的联邦财政收入甚至只达到支出的50％。在出现这种惊人赤字以后，国会的议员们又惊呼必须先平衡预算。于是在实行减税之后，胡佛又在1932年6月慌乱地签署了一项增税法案。但是在债台高筑和国库利息负担过重的情况下，要想平衡预算实际上已不可能。尽管在1933年罗斯福上台后放弃金本位，实行美元贬值，来挽救已趋崩溃的财政，但美国联邦政府的债务仍然继续上升。到1936年6月30日，美国国债就高达四百亿美元，已比胡佛上台时国债总额高出近一倍半。
    在这段时期中，罗斯福进行了各种大规模公共工程和救济计划，其开支数字远超过今天艾森豪威尔的开支规模，但是失业人数始终保持在一千万人以上的水平。到1937年下半年，一次猛烈的经济危机又袭击美国。于是稍见复原的美国经济，再次跌入危机的深渊中。直到第二次世界大战爆发，战时景气才使美国的经济从长期萧条中摆脱出来。
    今天华盛顿的决策者基本上仍是在沿用胡佛和罗斯福用过的旧武器来同新危机作斗争。由于战后美国国家垄断资本的加强，因此这次危机的发展和表现形式已同1929年的危机有所不同。但是从危机的成因来说，两者在基本上是一样的。因此艾森豪威尔政府是否会重踏胡佛的复辙，看来连白宫的决策者也毫无信心。面对着已为军费压得喘不过气来的联邦财政，艾森豪威尔在减税问题上举棋难定不正是害怕重演二十八年前胡佛的减税又加税的故事吗？
