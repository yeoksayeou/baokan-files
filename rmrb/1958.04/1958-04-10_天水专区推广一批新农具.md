Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou. The Tianshui Prefecture in Gansu recently held a conference to assess and promote improved farm tools. The conference showcased 170 new-style tools sent in by various counties, covering five major categories: farmland capital construction, irrigation, processing tools, tillage and planting, and mountain transportation. Several evaluation and appraisal groups formed at the conference adopted the method of "observing and learning, assessing item by item, learning from each other's strengths, improving on-site, and promoting locally" to evaluate these tools one by one. Finally, thirty-four types, including the "artificial rain machine," "high-line transporter," "mountain tricycle," "uphill manure cart," and "bellows water pump," were selected and determined for mass production and promotion.
