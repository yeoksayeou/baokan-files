Chairman Mao Makes the Red Light Cooperative Shine Brilliantly

	On the afternoon of March 16th, at a little past six o'clock, Chairman Mao arrived at the Red Light Agricultural Cooperative in Pi County, on the West Sichuan Plain. The cooperative's director, Zhou Guilin, and vice-director, Liu Xiansong, along with County Party Secretary Liu Zhitai and Rural Work Department head Pan Zhaoqing, happened to be there to greet Chairman Mao. They saw Chairman Mao walking towards them, full of vigor and smiling broadly. They almost cheered in unison; they were so excited that they nearly forgot to greet their beloved leader. In that instant, Chairman Mao had already approached them, greeted them warmly, shook their hands one by one, and even smiled, praising, "This is a verdant and flourishing place!"

Chairman Mao Showed Meticulous Concern for the People's Livelihoods

	Chairman Mao walked slowly along the mechanized farming road of the Red Light Cooperative. In the early spring of the West Sichuan Plain, there was an endless expanse of golden rapeseed flowers and lush green wheat seedlings; clear water flowing from the Dujiangyan Irrigation System quietly ran in the ditches beside the roads and fields. Chairman Mao looked around and walked onto a nearby path, heading towards a household; at the same time, turning to ask the cooperative directors:
	"Shall we visit a family first?"
	"Yes!" the cooperative directors answered in unison.

	Chairman Mao entered the home of a poor peasant. Inside was an elderly woman in her sixties, Lin Saihua, who was suffering from "pinkeye" these days. She did not recognize the person who had entered her house as Chairman Mao, thinking he was a cadre from another province.

	Chairman Mao sat down in the main room and said to Lin Saihua in Sichuan dialect, "Let's have a chat, shall we?" Then he asked her with concern when she joined the cooperative, how many people were in her family, how many were laborers, how much public grain she handed over, how much grain she sold to the state, and how much grain she received annually. He also asked with concern, "Is the grain ration enough to eat?" Lin Saihua replied, "It is enough to eat." At this time, vice-director Liu Xiansong, who was standing beside Chairman Mao, said to him, "Last year, each cooperative member received an average of more than four hundred catties of grain..." Chairman Mao then said to Lin Saihua, "What he says doesn't count. You tell me, is it really enough to eat?" Lin Saihua smiled with emotion and said, "It really is enough to eat!" This made Chairman Mao laugh, and everyone else laughed happily too.

Eliminating the Four Pests, Practicing Hygiene, Answering the Chairman's Heartfelt Concerns

	Chairman Mao then asked Lin Saihua, "Do you know your cooperative directors?"
	"I know them," Lin Saihua said, pointing to Zhou Guilin and Liu Xiansong, "This is our Director Zhou, this is Director Liu; our cooperative also has Director Zhang, Director Mu..."
	"Are the directors good to you?"
	"Yes," Lin Saihua said with a smiling face, "Our directors are always smiling when they see people." This made everyone laugh again.

	Chairman Mao also asked Lin Saihua with concern about the elimination of the "Four Pests":
	"Do you know about eliminating the Four Pests?"
	"I know, we are eliminating Seven Pests."
	"Which Seven Pests are you eliminating?"
	Lin Saihua said: sparrows, rats, flies, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs, and oil beetles.
	Chairman Mao then asked, "Why do you want to eliminate the Seven Pests?" Lin Saihua answered one by one, "Sparrows and rats steal grain, mosquitoes suck people's blood, flies have bacteria on their legs..."
	"What about the oil beetles? What harm do they do?"
	"Oil beetles crawl everywhere, they also have bacteria on their feet. The things they crawl on have a bad smell, and eating them can make you vomit."

	Chairman Mao was very satisfied with Lin Saihua's answer and praised:
	"You even understand scientific knowledge!"

	Chairman Mao wanted to see an oil beetle, but people searched all over Lin Saihua's cupboard and couldn't find one. Chairman Mao slowly stood up, walked closer to the cupboard, and looked at it. The cupboard was dust-free, and the dishes were neatly arranged. Chairman Mao was very happy. Then, turning around, he asked Lin Saihua, "Shall we take a look at your room?"

	Chairman Mao entered Lin Saihua's room and looked around. The room was not large, but it was very clean, and the furniture was relatively complete. Chairman Mao came out of the room and jokingly asked, "Is this family a landlord or a rich peasant?" Lin Saihua replied with a smile, "We are poor peasants." This made Chairman Mao laugh too, and he walked out of Lin Saihua's back door with satisfaction.

	As soon as Chairman Mao stepped out of Lin Saihua's house, Lin Saihua's daughter-in-law and neighbors jumped up with joy and said, "It's Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao is here!" Only then did Lin Saihua realize that the person who had been talking to her so kindly for so long was Chairman Mao! She hurried out of the house, taking three steps at a time. She caught up with Chairman Mao, so excited that she couldn't say anything.

With the Party's Leadership, We Will Surely Make Production Even Better

	On the way forward, Chairman Mao asked the cooperative directors in detail how many households were in the cooperative, how many fields, how many production teams, and whether there were production groups under the production teams. The two directors answered one by one.

	When Director Zhou Guilin mentioned that there were three captains in one production team, Chairman Mao asked with concern:
	"Are there any female captains among the three captains?"
	"Yes, each team has one female captain."
	"Are there any women among the group leaders?"
	"Each group has two group leaders, one male group leader and one female group leader."
	"Is there a female cooperative director?"
	"Yes, there is one female cooperative director."
	Chairman Mao asked, "Why didn't I see her?" The directors answered Chairman Mao and asked someone to notify the female director, Xiao Shaoqun, to come.

	Before long, while Chairman Mao was observing the dense wheat on a field ridge, Xiao Shaoqun came over excitedly. Chairman Mao seemed to recognize that she was the female director, and looked at her kindly. Xiao Shaoqun ran excitedly to Chairman Mao and said, "Hello, Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao shook hands with her and asked with concern, "Your cooperative has more than nine hundred households, can you manage it?" Although Xiao Shaoqun had encountered some difficulties in her work, she firmly replied, "I can manage it!" Director Zhou Guilin, who was standing beside her, added, "With the Party's leadership!" Chairman Mao nodded with a smile.

	As Chairman Mao walked and talked with the directors, he saw some small plots of wheat land beside the road where the wheat was relatively short. He asked, "Is this wheat considered good?" The two directors replied that this was wheat grown by the cooperative members on their private plots, not very good, just average.

	Chairman Mao approached a rapeseed field, stopped, walked into the field, and stood among the rapeseed flowers. He stroked the rapeseed while asking, "How many catties of rapeseed can be harvested from one mu of land?" The rapeseed stalks in this field were thick and strong, and the seeds were full. Zhou Guilin estimated roughly, "One mu can yield one hundred seventy or eighty catties." Chairman Mao nodded with a smile, touching the rapeseed with his left hand and extending his right hand to chest height, asking, "Can it grow this tall?" Then he gestured to neck height, asking, "Can it grow this tall?" Finally, gesturing to the height of a person, he asked, "Can it grow this tall?" The directors were deeply moved, thinking: How broad-minded and far-sighted Chairman Mao is, how concerned he is about agricultural production! The Chairman's words were like a key opening their minds, and the directors were determined to fulfill Chairman Mao's request! Vice-Director Liu Xiansong was also confident that next year's yellow rapeseed would definitely grow as tall as Chairman Mao gestured the third time, and that he would make a specimen of one plant and send it to Beijing to give to Chairman Mao.

Grateful for the Leader's Kindness, Young People Must Study and Work Hard

	Chairman Mao was walking on the mechanized farming road, and many women and children were already standing by the roadside. Chairman Mao greeted them cordially with nods, walked closer to a group of children, pointed to the child in front and asked, "Do you go to school?" When he asked the fourth child, someone beside him replied that she had graduated from higher primary school more than two years ago, and had been participating in agricultural production at home since graduation. Chairman Mao then asked, "Is labor good?" The girl answered briskly, "Good!" Chairman Mao said approvingly, "Very good!"

	Chairman Mao turned to ask the directors, "Has the cooperative established a people's school?" Zhou Guilin said, "We have established one." Chairman Mao then asked, "Would it be good to establish another one?" Several directors all said, "Good."

	Walking forward for a while, Chairman Mao turned onto a small path again, heading towards a hemp field. To get to the hemp field, he had to cross a small ditch more than three feet wide. Zhou Guilin crossed the ditch first, wanting to help Chairman Mao over. However, Chairman Mao lightly stepped forward and jumped, already crossing to the other side of the ditch. How healthy the leader's body is! A warm current of happiness immediately swept through everyone's body.

	The two directors walked down to the hemp field. Chairman Mao asked before descending, "Will it damage the hemp?" Zhou Guilin smiled and said to Chairman Mao, "No, the seedlings are small, it's okay to walk in the middle."

	Chairman Mao was inquiring about the situation of hemp production. Suddenly, he saw a little girl coming from the opposite side with her right hand wrapped in cloth and hanging in front of her chest. Chairman Mao asked the little girl with maternal kindness:
	"How did you hurt your hand?"
	This girl had come to see the beloved leader. She did not expect Chairman Mao to ask her a question, but the question was so kind! The girl replied, "It was cracked open by the hoe handle when I was reclaiming wasteland, and it is festering."

	After hearing this, Chairman Mao turned to the doctor and instructed:
	"Give her some medicine and treat it well."
	This girl, who graduated from elementary school, was named Wang Zuyun. She took the ointment given by Chairman Mao, so excited that she didn't know how to thank him. She thought to herself that she must always be devoted to agricultural production, and work even harder than her father, to repay Chairman Mao's care.

"Break the Bowl Flower" Should Be Widely Promoted

	On the way back to the mechanized farming road, Chairman Mao asked the directors about the work of eliminating the Seven Pests:
	"Can you eliminate all the Seven Pests this year?"
	"We will definitely eliminate them all!" Zhou Guilin answered so resolutely.
	"What methods are you using? How are you eliminating sparrows?"
	"Sparrows are easy to deal with. We organize everyone, work day and night, drive them everywhere, leaving only an open space for them to land, and hitting them as soon as they land!"
	"What about rats?"
	"Rats are also easy to deal with," Zhou Guilin reported in detail the methods of eliminating rats.
	"What about flies and mosquitoes?"
	"Flies and mosquitoes are even easier to deal with!"
	Chairman Mao asked with particular interest why flies and mosquitoes were easier to deal with. Zhou Guilin explained the cooperative's effectiveness in using "Break the Bowl Flower" to eliminate mosquitoes and flies. This is a wild poisonous herb, and its sap has a strong killing effect. Putting this flower or its sap in the manure pit can kill maggots and mosquito larvae. Chairman Mao then asked, "Why is it called 'Break the Bowl Flower'?" Minister Pan Zhaoqing, who came from a peasant background, replied, "In the past, in order to prevent children from picking this flower, the farmers would tell the children that if they picked this flower, they would break the bowl, and if they broke the bowl, they wouldn't be able to eat. That's how 'Break the Bowl Flower' got its name."

	Chairman Mao was very happy to hear this and said, "This is a major discovery. It is a creation of the masses. Good method, it should be promoted." He also asked if they could find this "Break the Bowl Flower". The director said that this flower is everywhere, and he casually pulled one from the edge of the field. Chairman Mao said, "Very good, take it back and show it to everyone at the meeting tomorrow." He also instructed the county party secretary and an agricultural technician from the Provincial Department of Agriculture stationed in the Red Light Cooperative to start writing an article, write it tomorrow, review it the day after tomorrow, and publish it in the newspaper the day after that. Always remember this happy moment,

Determined to Make the Red Light Cooperative Shine Brilliantly

	The sky was gradually darkening. Chairman Mao was about to leave. The people who heard the good news of Chairman Mao's arrival were very excited. What could be happier than seeing their leader? They couldn't help but run to the mechanized farming road! Chairman Mao was humbly waving and greeting the people, shaking hands with those in front of him. Female cooperative member, sixty-one-year-old Xu Jiaqun, had this wish in her heart since she was liberated after the land reform in 1952. Now, this wish of many years has been realized, she really saw Chairman Mao! She suddenly felt that she should shake hands with Chairman Mao, but her hands were full of mud from spreading hemp seedlings, wouldn't it dirty the leader's hands? What should she do? Should she wash them? There was no time! Chairman Mao had already extended his hand. She held Chairman Mao's hand tightly, so moved that she almost shed tears…

	Chairman Mao left. However, people will always remember this happy moment! The members of the Red Light Cooperative discussed the leap forward plan that night, and everyone was determined to use the actual actions of the great leap in production to thank Chairman Mao for his care and to make the Red Light Cooperative shine brilliantly. Director Zhou Guilin and Vice-Director Xiao Shaoqun, they are husband and wife; in the Party, one is the branch secretary and the other is the deputy secretary. They could not sleep all night. In the deep of the night, Xiao Shaoqun solemnly said to Zhou Guilin, "Guilin, we must do better from now on! Otherwise, people will say, 'A couple, director and deputy director, both secretaries, and they still messed up after seeing Chairman Mao!'" Zhou Guilin couldn't hold back either: "I, Zhou Guilin, am not that kind of person! In 1954, when the spontaneous forces were so fierce, I didn't take a step back! Now I must lead the Red Light Cooperative even better, I must be worthy of the masses, worthy of the Party, and worthy of Chairman Mao!"

	A welcome rain that night. "Spring rain is as precious as oil." The next day, the spring colors in the fields were even richer. The sky was slightly transparent, and the Red Light Cooperative was already shining brilliantly, with songs of labor echoing everywhere. In this early spring season, the beloved leader sowed the seeds of the leap forward for the Sichuanese farmers. The Sichuanese farmers will certainly live up to the Party's concern and offer the fruits of the harvest to the Party and the beloved leader Chairman Mao.

    毛主席使红光社大放红光
    3月16日的下午六点多钟，毛主席来到川西平原上的郫县红光农业社。社长周桂林和副社长刘贤松，还有县委书记刘致台和农村工作部长潘兆清，正好迎上了毛主席。他们看到毛主席精神奕奕、笑容满面地走来，几乎齐声地欢呼起来；心情的激动，差点忘了向敬爱的领袖问好。就在这一瞬间，毛主席已经走近了他们，亲切地招呼，一一地握手，还微笑着称赞说，这里是一片青枝绿叶啊！
    毛主席无微不至地关心群众生活
    毛主席在红光社的机耕道上缓步前行。早春的川西平原，四处是一望无际的金黄色菜花和碧绿的麦苗；从都江堰流来的清水，在道旁田边的沟里静静地流着。毛主席环顾了一下四周，走上就近的一条小路，向着一户人家走去；同时，侧过身来问社长们：
    “我们先看一户人家好不好？”
    “好！”社长们同声地回答。
    毛主席走进了一户贫农的家。屋里有一位六十来岁的老婆婆林赛华，她这几天正患“火眼”病，没有看出进屋来的是毛主席，还以为是来了一位外省干部。
    毛主席在堂屋里坐下，用四川话对林赛华说：“我们摆一摆好不好？”接着关切地问了林赛华什么时候入的社，一家几口，有几个劳动力，交多少公粮，卖多少统购粮，一年分多少口粮，还关心地问：“口粮够不够吃？”林赛华回答说：“够吃。”这时，站在一边的副社长刘贤松向毛主席说：“去年平均每个社员分四百多斤粮，……”毛主席又对林赛华说：“他说的不算，你说，是不是真的够吃？”林赛华感动得笑起来说：“真的够吃！”说得毛主席笑了，大家也都幸福地笑了。
    除四害，讲卫生，回答主席一片心
    毛主席又问林赛华：“你认不认得你们的社长？”
    “认得到，”林赛华指着周桂林和刘贤松说，“这是我们的周社长，这是刘社长；我们社还有张社长，穆社长，……”
    “社长对你们好不好？”
    “好，”林赛华笑容满面地说：“我们的社长见人都是笑眯眯的。”说得大家又都笑了。
    毛主席还关切地向林赛华问起除“四害”的情形：
    “你知不知道除四害？”
    “知道，我们是除七害。”
    “你们是除那七害？”
    林赛华说：麻雀、老鼠、苍蝇、蚊子、跳蚤、臭虫、偷油婆。
    毛主席又问：“为什么要除七害呢？”林赛华一一回答说：“麻雀、老鼠要偷粮食吃，蚊子吸人的血，苍蝇腿杆上有细菌，……”
    “偷油婆呢？偷油婆有什么害处？”
    “偷油婆到处爬，脚上也有细菌，它爬过的东西还有臭气，吃了要发呕。”
    毛主席对林赛华的回答很满意，称赞说：
    “你还懂得科学知识哩！”
    毛主席想看一看偷油婆，可是，人们在林赛华家的碗柜里找遍了，也没有发现一个。毛主席慢慢地站起来，走拢碗柜看了看。这碗柜没有灰尘，碗盏放得整整齐齐的。毛主席很高兴。随着，转过身来又问林赛华：“再看看你们的房间好不好？”
    毛主席走进林赛华的房间，环视了一下。这房间不算大，但整理得很清洁，家具摆设也较齐全。毛主席走出房来，风趣地问道：“这家是地主，还是富农啊！”林赛华笑着回答说：“我们是贫农。”说得毛主席也笑了，满意地走出了林赛华家的后门。
    毛主席刚刚跨出林赛华家，林赛华的媳妇和邻居们就欢乐得跳起来说：“是毛主席！”“毛主席来了！”这时，林赛华才知道刚才亲切地和自己谈了这许久话的，原来是毛主席！她三步并作两步连忙赶出屋去。追上毛主席，激动得反而说不出话来了。
    有党的领导，一定能把生产搞得更好
    在向前走去的路上，毛主席向社长们详细地问起社里有好多户，有好多田，有多少个生产队，生产队下面有没有生产组。两位社长一一作了回答。
    当社长周桂林说到一个生产队有三个队长的时候，毛主席关心地问：
    “三个队长里面有没有女队长呢？”
    “有，每个队都有一个女队长。”
    “组长里面有没有女的？”
    “每个组都有两个组长，一个男组长，一个女组长。”
    “有没有女社长？”
    “也有，有一个女社长。”
    毛主席问：“怎么没有看到她？”社长们一面回答毛主席，一面就叫人去通知女社长萧绍群来。
    不多一会，毛主席在一条田坎上观察着茂密的麦子时，萧绍群就兴高采烈地过来了。毛主席像看出了她是女社长，慈祥地望着她。萧绍群激动地奔到毛主席跟前，说：“毛主席好！”毛主席和她握手，关切地问她：“你们社有九百多户人家，管得下吗？”尽管萧绍群平时工作中也遇到过一些困难，但她坚定地回答：“能管得下！”站在旁边的社长周桂林也接着说：“有党的领导！”毛主席含笑地点了点头。
    毛主席和社长们边谈边走，看到路边的一些小块的麦子地，麦子长得比较矮小，就问：“这些麦子算不算好的？”两位社长回答说：这是社员们在自留地上种的小麦，不算好，是中等的。
    毛主席走近了一块菜籽田，停留下来，走到田里，站在菜花丛间，一边抚摸着菜籽，一边问：“一亩田能收好多斤菜籽？”这块田里的菜籽茎秆粗壮，籽实饱满。周桂林约略地估计了一下说：“一亩能收一百七八十斤。”毛主席含笑地点点头，左手摸着菜籽，右手伸到齐胸的高度问：“能不能长这么高？”又比到齐颈的高度问：“能不能长这么高？”最后一次比着一人高的模样，问道：“能不能长这么高？”社长们深受感动地想：毛主席的胸怀多么宽广，多么高瞻远瞩，对农业生产是多么关心啊！主席的话像钥匙打开了人们的心窍，社长们都有决心来实现毛主席的这个要求！副社长刘贤松还满有信心地要使明年的黄油菜一定长得像毛主席第三次比的那样高，用一株制成标本，寄到北京去，送给毛主席。
    感谢领袖恩情，青年人要好好学习和劳动
    毛主席在机耕道上走着，路边已经站了不少妇女和小孩。毛主席和蔼地和她们点头招呼，走近一群孩子的身边，指着跟前的孩子问：“你上学没有？”问到第四个孩子的时候，旁边有人回答说：她从高小毕业已经有两年多了，毕业以后就在家里参加农业生产。毛主席又问：“劳动好不好？”小姑娘爽快地回答：“好！”毛主席赞许地说：“很好！”
    毛主席转身问社长们：“社里办了民校没有？”周桂林说：“办了一个。”毛主席又问：“再办一个好不好？”几位社长都说：“好。”
    往前走了一段路，毛主席又转上一条小道，向一块麻田走去。到麻田要跨越一条三尺多宽的小沟。周桂林先跨过沟，想扶毛主席过去。可是，毛主席轻捷地提步一跃，早已跨到沟的对面。领袖的身体是多么健康啊！一股幸福的暖流顿时通遍每个人的身上。
    两位社长走下麻田。毛主席未下麻田先发问：“会不会踩坏麻？”周桂林笑着对毛主席说：“不会，苗子小，从中间走不要紧。”
    毛主席在询问大麻生产的情形。忽然看到一个右手用布裹着吊在胸前的小姑娘，正从对面走来，毛主席慈母般地问小姑娘：
    “你的手是怎么伤的？”
    这姑娘是来看望敬爱的领袖的。她没有想到毛主席会向自己问话，可是这问话是多么亲切！小姑娘回答说：“是开荒的时候被锄把震裂了口，正在溃脓。”
    毛主席听说后，就转向医生，嘱咐说：
    “给她点药，好好治好。”
    这个小学毕业的姑娘叫王祖运。她接过毛主席给的药膏，激动得不知该怎样道谢。她心里想，一定要永远安心农业生产，劳动得要比爸爸还好，来报答毛主席的关怀。
    “打破碗花花”要好好推广
    在返回机耕道的路上，毛主席又向社长们问起除七害的工作：
    “今年能不能把七害除完？”
    “一定能除完！”周桂林回答得是这样坚决。
    “你们用什么办法呢？麻雀怎么消灭呢？”
    麻雀好办。我们把大家组织起来，熬更漏夜地干，到处又?又赶，只留下一个空地，让它们停下来，落一个就打一个！”
    “老鼠呢？”
    “老鼠也好办，”周桂林又详细地汇报了消灭老鼠的办法。
    “苍蝇、蚊子呢？”
    “苍蝇、蚊子更好办！”
    毛主席特别有兴趣地问为什么苍蝇蚊子更好办，周桂林就说明了社上用“打破碗花花”消灭蚊蝇的效果。这是一种野生的毒草，它的浆汁有强烈的杀伤性。把这种花或者它的浆汁放在粪坑里，就能杀死蛆虫和蚊子的幼虫孑孓。毛主席又问：“为什么叫‘打破碗花花’？”农民出身的部长潘兆清回答说：“从前为了防止孩子们去摘这种花，农民就对孩子们说，摘了这种花，就要打破碗，打破了碗，就吃不成饭，‘打破碗花花’就这样得了名。”
    毛主席听了很高兴，说：“这是一个重大的发现。是群众的一个创造。好办法，要推广。”又问能不能找到这个“打破碗花花”。社长说，这种花到处都有，说着就在田坎边随手拔来一株。毛主席说：“很好，带回去，明天开会给大家看看。”并且嘱咐县委书记和省农业厅驻红光社的一个农技师动手写稿，明天写成，后天审稿，再后天登报。永远记住这个幸福的时刻，
    决心使红光社大放红光
    天色渐渐地落黑。毛主席快要走了。听到毛主席来了的喜讯的人们，心情十分激动，有什么比见到自己的领袖更幸福的呢？他们脚不由主地奔向机耕道来！毛主席正谦和地向人们招手致意，同跟前的人们握手。女社员、六十一岁的老婆婆许家群，在1952年土地改革翻身后就存了这个心，如今，这多少年来的心愿实现了，果真看到了毛主席！她突然觉得应该和毛主席握个手，可是，刚刚匀过麻秧，满手泥灰，不会脏了领袖的手吗？怎么办呢？洗一洗吧？来不及了！毛主席已经伸过手来。她紧紧握住毛主席的手，感动得差点掉下泪来。……
    毛主席走了。然而，人们将永远记得这个幸福的时刻！红光社的社员们当晚就讨论了跃进计划，每个人都决心用生产大跃进的实际行动，来感谢毛主席的关怀，使红光社大放红光。社长周桂林和副社长萧绍群，他们是夫妇俩；在党内，一个是支部书记，一个是副书记。他俩彻夜不能入眠。夜半更深了，萧绍群还在郑重地对周桂林说：“桂林，从今后一定要干得更好啊！要不，人家会说，‘夫妇两个，正副社长，都是书记，还亏他们都见了毛主席的哩！’”周桂林也沉不住了：“我周桂林不是那种人！1954年自发势力闹得那样凶，我没有退过一步！如今一定要把红光社领导得更好，我一定要对得起群众，对得起党，对得起毛主席！”
    当夜一场喜雨。“春雨贵如油”，第二天，田野里的春色显得更浓。天色微微透明，红光社已经大放红光，四处传出劳动的歌声。在这早春季节里，敬爱的领袖给四川农民播下了跃进的种籽，四川农民一定能够不负党的关怀，以丰收的硕果献给党和敬爱的领袖毛主席。
