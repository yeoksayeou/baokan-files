Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 8th: Another large-scale water conservancy project to benefit the people by drawing water from the Yellow River in the lower reaches of the south bank – the Zhengzhou Gangli Yellow River Irrigation Project – has commenced.

The foundation of the water diversion gate of this project broke ground on March 31st. The water diversion headgate and channel engineering are scheduled to be completed by the end of May, with water release on June 1st.

The water diversion headgate of this project is being built on the Yellow River levee between the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway and Huayuankou. The water diversion flow rate is 280 cubic meters per second. The main canal mostly utilizes the Jialu River, a tributary of the Huai River, and its tributary the Suoxu River for water conveyance, with several branch canals diverting from the Suoxu River and the Jialu River.

Upon completion, this project will irrigate 7 million mu of farmland in 15 counties and cities in the three special districts of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xuchang, and Shangqiu, including the development of 4 million mu of paddy fields. After the Kuomintang reactionaries breached the Huayuankou Yellow River levee in 1938, the Yellow River flooded area resulted in large areas of sandy wasteland. After the completion of this project, hundreds of thousands of mu of sandy wasteland and saline-alkali land in Luguan, Weishi County, and Cuiqiao, Fugou County, can be improved through siltation. The shipping industry of the Jialu River and its tributaries, the Shuangbo River, and the major Huai River tributaries, the Shaying River and the Wo River, will be further developed due to the increased water volume. At the same time, Zhengzhou City will also receive an ample supply of industrial water.

The channels of this project can be connected to the Huayuankou, Kaifeng City Hegangkou, and the Dongbatou Yellow River irrigation systems currently under construction, forming a vast irrigation network to fully exploit the effectiveness of the irrigation project.

This project is a prototype of one of the 46-level cascade development projects in the Yellow River Basin Plan. The Yellow River Basin Plan stipulates the construction of a dam for water storage in Taohuayu, west of the Zhengzhou Bridge on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway. It is now considered that after the completion of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the scouring of the riverbed due to the river water becoming clearer will affect the consolidation of the Zhengzhou Bridge. Therefore, this cascade will be moved to Gangli, east of the bridge. The current Gangli Yellow River diversion project is mainly for the development of irrigation. In the future, the construction of a river-blocking dam for water storage, the addition of ship locks, and the expansion of the water diversion gate will make it a water conservancy hub. At that time, it will not only connect the shipping of the Yellow River and the Huai River, linking Zhengzhou, Zhoukou, and the rivers in eastern Henan into a shipping network, but also enable the irrigation area in this region to expand to 15 million mu, of which the paddy field area can be developed to more than 9 million mu.

### 引用黄河水为人民造福  岗李引黄灌溉工程开工

    引用黄河水为人民造福
    岗李引黄灌溉工程开工
    据新华社郑州8日电　黄河下游南岸又一项引用黄河水为人民造福的大型水利工程——郑州岗李引黄灌溉工程开工。
    这项工程的引水闸基础，已经在3月31日破土开挖。引水渠首闸和渠道工程计划在5月底完成，6月1日放水。
    这项工程的引水渠首闸，建设在京广铁路郑州黄河大桥和花园口之间的黄河大堤上。引水流量为二百八十秒公方，总干渠大部分利用淮河支流贾鲁河和它的支流索须河输水，再从索须河和贾鲁河分出几条干渠。
    这项工程完成后，可以灌溉郑州市和开封、许昌、商丘三个专区十五个县市的七百万亩农田，其中包括发展水稻田四百万亩。1938年国民党反动派扒开花园口黄河大堤后，黄河水泛滥地区造成了大片沙荒。这项工程完工后，其中尉氏县卢馆和扶沟县崔桥一带的几十万亩沙荒盐碱地，就可以经过放淤而得到改良。贾鲁河及其支流双泊河和淮河大支流沙颍河、涡河的航运事业，将因水量大增得到进一步的发展。同时，郑州市还可以得到充足的工业用水。
    这个工程的渠道可以同花园口、开封市黑岗口和正在兴建的东坝头引黄灌溉渠系联接起来，构成一个幅员广大的灌溉渠网，以充分发挥灌溉工程的效能。
    这项工程，是黄河流域规划四十六级梯级开发工程之一的雏形。黄河流域规划中有在京广铁路郑州大桥西面桃花峪兴建壅水坝的规定。现在考虑：三门峡水库建成后，要因河水变清淘刷河槽，影响郑州大桥的巩固。因此，将这个梯级移在大桥东面的岗李。现在兴建的岗李引黄工程，主要是为了发展灌溉。将来再建筑拦河壅水坝，增加船闸，扩建引水闸，就成为水利枢纽，那时不只可以沟通黄河和淮河的航运，使郑州、周口和豫东各河道联成一个航运网，而且可以使这个地区的灌溉面积发展到一千五百万亩，其中水稻面积可以发展到九百多万亩。
