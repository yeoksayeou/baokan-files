Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, April 25th: Dimov, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, said at a rally held here recently to commemorate the 88th anniversary of Lenin's birth that creatively developing Marxism-Leninism and adhering to the purity of Marxism-Leninism are the primary obligations of every communist party to its working class and the world's workers' movement. Every party has the legitimate right to freely formulate its own program, and we are unwilling to interfere in the internal affairs of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. However, if we do not point out some incorrect views in the draft program that violate Marxist-Leninist principles, we will not have fulfilled our internationalist obligations.

Dimov said that the draft program departs from the Marxist-Leninist understanding on some issues of the international communist movement and socialist practice. For example, the authors of the draft program ignored the fundamental contradictions between the capitalist system and the socialist system, and incorrectly explained the fraternal friendship, equality, and mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as the political and economic subordination between capitalist countries.

The draft program belittles the world historical significance of the October Socialist Revolution and the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, and deliberately fails to mention the leading role of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the socialist camp and the world communist movement, which is recognized by the communist parties of all countries.

The draft program gives an incorrect assessment of the role and status of the bourgeois state under the current conditions, blurs the class nature of the bourgeois state, and attempts to give it a supra-class nature. In fact, the draft program puts forward the proposition that capitalism peacefully and spontaneously grows into socialism, which was long ago smashed by Lenin.

Dimov criticized the draft program's argument that the proletarian state should wither away after socialist transformation has been realized in the economy and that it has become an "obstacle" to the further development of socialism. Dimov said that the historical experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries shows that the proletarian state is not only necessary for the realization of economic socialist transformation, but it not only does not hinder the building of socialism and communism, but on the contrary, it is the main weapon for achieving these great goals. Under the current conditions, when the imperialists are stepping up preparations for war against the socialist camp, weakening the proletarian state, or denying its decisive role in socialist construction and the gradual transition to communism, actually means disarming the socialist countries in the face of the imperialist forces of aggression.

Dimov said that we know that the draft program is only a draft, and it is still being formulated. We hope that incorrect formulations will be corrected in accordance with Marxist-Leninist principles.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, April 25th: According to Romanian newspapers, Leontin Răutu, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Romanian Workers' Party, commented on the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia at a rally held here recently to commemorate the 88th anniversary of Lenin's birth.

Răutu said: "The ideas of the declaration of the Moscow Conference of the Parties helped the Central Committee of our Party analyze the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which was recently published and provided for members of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia to discuss." He pointed out that the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party believes that "many arguments included in the draft program, such as the assessment of international relations and the arguments on the international communist movement, are opposed to the positions and estimates of other communist parties, their positions and estimates are embodied in the declaration of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries based on Marxist-Leninist principles. Those estimates in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, especially the estimates on the relations between socialist countries, the relations between communist and workers' parties of all countries, the experience of the Soviet Union and other communist parties, and the role of the state in building socialism, can only spread confusion in the international workers' movement and cannot serve the cause of peace and socialism."

Răutu also pointed out that the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party believes that it is completely inconsistent with historical facts and harmful to the socialist cause to determine that one of the sources of the existence of two social systems or "two hostile military-political blocs" is the "policy of dividing spheres of influence" by the imperialist groups and the socialist camp countries for the purpose of exercising hegemony and rule over the people of small countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 25th: Albanian Labor Party Central Committee Member Rita Marko recently commented on the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia at a rally of all circles in Tirana to commemorate Lenin's birth anniversary. She emphasized that there are many places in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that are revisionist and anti-Marxist-Leninist. In essence, this document is against the unity of socialist countries and the international communist movement. It is contradictory to the declaration passed by the communist parties and workers' parties of all countries in Moscow.

Rita Marko said that today not only communists, but even the working people of the whole world clearly understand the international significance of the Soviet experience, but there is not a word in the draft program about the necessity of the leading center of the international communist and workers' movement, nor is there a word about the facts of this leading center.

She went on to point out that this draft program negates the difference between the two systems of socialism and capitalism, and even equates the socialist camp with the imperialist camp. The draft even believes that capitalism seems to be able to automatically transition to socialism.

Rita Marko said that it is precisely because of these reasons that the Albanian Labor Party opposes this draft program.

Rita Marko said that in order to get closer to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, our party has made many efforts on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles. However, it is clear that leaving the principles of Marxism-Leninism cannot achieve the goal of rapprochement.

    保罗阿三国党的负责人指出
    南共纲领草案多处违背马列主义原则
    新华社索非亚25日电　保加利亚共产党中央政治局候补委员迪莫夫在最近这里举行的纪念列宁诞生八十八周年集会上谈到南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案时说，创造性地发展马克思列宁主义和坚持马克思列宁主义的纯洁性是每个共产党对自己的工人阶级和世界工人运动首要的义务。每个党都有合法的权利来自由地制订自己的纲领，我们不愿意干涉南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的内部事务。但是，如果我们不指出纲领草案中一些不正确的、违背马克思列宁主义原则的观点，我们就没有尽到自己的国际主义义务。
    迪莫夫说，纲领草案在国际共产主义运动和社会主义实践的一些问题上脱离了马克思列宁主义的理解。例如，纲领草案的作者忽视了资本主义体系和社会主义体系间的基本矛盾，不正确地阐述苏联和其他社会主义国家间的兄弟友好、平等、互助的关系以及资本主义国家间在政治、经济上的附属关系。
    纲领草案贬低了十月社会主义革命和苏联社会主义建设经验的世界历史意义，故意不提各国共产党公认的苏联和苏联共产党在社会主义阵营和世界共产主义运动中的领导作用。
    纲领草案对当前条件下的资产阶级国家的作用和地位给予了不正确的估价，模糊了资产阶级国家的阶级本质，企图赋予它以超阶级的性质。实际上，纲领草案提出了早已被列宁粉碎了的、关于资本主义和平地自发长入社会主义的主张。
    迪莫夫批判了纲领草案中关于在经济中实现了社会主义改造以后无产阶级国家应该灭亡和它已经成为进一步发展社会主义的“障碍”的论点。迪莫夫说，苏联和其他社会主义国家的历史经验表明，无产阶级国家不仅对实现经济上的社会主义改造是必需的，它不仅不妨碍建设社会主义和共产主义，相反是达到这些伟大目标的主要武器。在目前条件下，当帝国主义者加紧准备反对社会主义阵营的战争的时候，削弱无产阶级国家、或者否认它在社会主义建设和向共产主义逐步过渡中的决定性作用，实际上就意味着在帝国主义侵略力量面前解除社会主义国家的武装。
    迪莫夫说，我们知道，纲领草案还只是一个草案，它目前还在制订当中。我们希望，不正确的提法将根据马克思列宁主义的原则加以纠正。
    新华社布加勒斯特25日电　据罗马尼亚报纸报道，罗马尼亚工人党政治局候补委员勒昂特·拉乌图在这里最近举行的纪念列宁诞生八十八周年集会上评论了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案。
    拉乌图说：“各国党莫斯科会议的宣言的思想帮助了我们党中央分析不久前发表和提供南共盟员讨论的南共纲领草案。”他指出，罗马尼亚工人党中央认为，“在纲领草案中所包括的许多论点，例如对国际关系的估价和关于国际共产主义运动问题的论点，是同其他共产党的立场和估计相对抗的，他们的立场和估价体现在以马克思列宁主义原则为基础的社会主义国家的共产党和工人党的宣言中。南共纲领草案中的那些估计，特别是对社会主义国家之间的关系、各国共产党和工人党之间的关系、苏联和其他共产党的经验、国家在建设社会主义中的作用等问题的估计，只能在国际工人运动中传播混乱，不能服务于和平和社会主义事业。”
    拉乌图还指出，罗马尼亚工人党中央认为，断定两种社会制度或“两种敌对的军事政治集团”存在的根源之一是帝国主义集团和社会主义阵营国家以对小国人民实行霸权和统治为目的的“划分势力范围的政策”，这是完全不符合历史事实和有害于社会主义事业的。
    新华社地拉那25日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员?奇米叶·霍查最近在地拉那各界纪念列宁诞辰的集会上评论了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案。她强调指出，在南共纲领草案中有很多地方是修正主义的、是反马克思列宁主义的。实质上，这一文件是在反对社会主义各国的团结和国际共产主义运动。它是同各国共产党、工人党在莫斯科通过的宣言相矛盾的。
    ?·霍查说，今天不仅共产党人，连全世界的劳动人民也都清楚地了解苏联经验的国际意义，但是在纲领草案中没有一句话谈到国际共产主义和工人运动领导中心的必然性，也没有一句话谈到这一领导中心的事实。
    她接着指出，这个纲领草案否定了社会主义和资本主义两个体系之间的差别，甚至把社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营之间划上了等号，草案甚至认为资本主义似乎可以自动过渡到社会主义。
    ?·霍查表示，正是由于这些，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党反对这一纲领草案。
    ?·霍查说，为了同南共接近，我们的党在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上曾经作出了不少的努力。但是，很明显，离开马克思列宁主义的原则就不能达到接近的目的。
