Xinhua News Agency, April 29th. He Xiangning, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, held a banquet this afternoon to entertain overseas Chinese returning to China travel groups and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots sightseeing groups from more than ten countries, including Indonesia, Burma, India, Vietnam, and Cambodia.

　　He Xiangning delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. First, on behalf of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, she expressed a warm welcome to the returned overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots. Then, she introduced the achievements of the motherland's socialist construction and the new situation of the Great Leap Forward. She said that overseas Chinese are all enthusiastic patriots. Although they are far away from the motherland, they all eagerly look forward to the motherland's prosperity and strength. Everyone will surely feel comforted to see the progress of the motherland through this visit and on-the-spot observation. I hope that everyone can convey the situation of the motherland's construction that you have seen on this return to the overseas Chinese who have not returned to the country. She also hopes that all overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots will, together with the people of the whole country, actively support the motherland's socialist construction cause.
