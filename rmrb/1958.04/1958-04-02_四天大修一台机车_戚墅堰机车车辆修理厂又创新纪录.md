Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 1st: The Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant repaired a major overhaul locomotive in four days on the 29th, once again setting a new national record for major locomotive overhauls.

This SL7 type No. 651 locomotive was severely damaged when it entered the factory for repair, and many parts needed to be replaced and repaired. When repairing the locomotive, the workers adjusted the labor shifts, arranged the work process, and closely connected and cooperated with each work area, group, and process, and constantly improved the repair methods. In the past, dismantling the locomotive involved everyone working together to dismantle the entire locomotive from top to bottom, and then hoisting the boiler for repair after all the parts were removed. This time, they learned from the dismantling experience of the Huangguatun Locomotive and Passenger Car Repair Plant, and changed this process to hoisting the boiler first, and then dismantling it simultaneously on both sides. This not only made the operation safer and more convenient for the workers, but also shortened the dismantling time. After the locomotive was repaired, it was specially tested on the railway at a speed of 75 kilometers per hour, proving that the quality was good.

    四天大修一台机车
    戚墅堰机车车辆修理厂又创新纪录
    据新华社南京1日电　戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂以四天时间，在29日修好一台大修机车，再次创造大修机车全国新纪录。
    这台ㄙㄌ七型六五一号机车，进厂修理时，损坏严重，需要换修的配件很多。工人们在修车时，调整了劳动班次，安排好作业过程，各工区、小组和各工序紧密衔接，互相配合，随时改进修理方法。拆车解体，过去是整个机车上下一齐动手拆，等全部零件拆完后再吊修锅炉。这次，他们学习了皇姑屯机车客车修理工厂的拆车经验，把这个工序改为先吊起锅炉，然后双方同时拆。这样，不但工人操作起来安全、方便，而且缩短了拆车时间。机车修好后，经过每小时七十五公里的速度在铁路上专程单机试跑，证明质量良好。
