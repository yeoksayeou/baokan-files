Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 27th: According to a report from Sana'a by a Middle East News Agency reporter, a Yemeni government spokesman said on April 27th that Yemeni troops have never attempted to enter the British-imposed occupied territories of Yemen or the so-called British "Protectorate" borders. On the contrary, Yemeni villages are frequently targeted by British cannons, aircraft, and tanks.

The spokesman refuted the statement made by British Foreign Secretary Lloyd in the House of Commons on April 23rd, alleging that Yemeni troops had attacked Aden.

The spokesman said that the Yemeni government welcomes an investigation team to investigate, so that the British people and all peace-loving people in the world can understand the British aggression and the situation in the occupied territories of Yemen.

The spokesman also accused the British authorities in Aden of adopting its current new imperialist policy—launching aggression against peaceful Arab countries.

    英外交大臣贼喊捉贼
    也门发言人予以驳斥
    据新华社开罗27日电　据中东通讯社记者从萨那报道，也门政府发言人27日说，也门军队从来没有试图进入英国强行划定的也门被占领地区或所谓英国“保护地”的疆界，相反，也门村庄却时常成为英国大炮、飞机和坦克袭击的目标。
    发言人驳斥了英国外交大臣劳埃德4月23日在下院发表的所谓也门军队袭击亚丁的声明。
    发言人说，也门政府欢迎调查团前来调查，以便让英国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民都了解英国的侵略和也门被占领地区的状况。
    发言人还指责亚丁的英国当局采取它现在的新的帝国主义政策——发动对和平的阿拉伯国家的侵略。
