Consumer's Voice:

    Hoping for the Production of Reinforced-Sole Socks
    Not long ago, I bought two pairs of very pretty cotton socks for each of my two children, thinking that the new socks could last them a month or two. Who knew that they wore out in less than a week, and after washing them two or three times, the soles of the socks were already torn. It made me feel very uncomfortable to see my children wearing patched socks that were otherwise still bright and new. Unexpectedly, the old lady next door told me that her children had to patch their new socks after only wearing them once, and she was busy enough just patching socks. Therefore, I hope that the China Knitwear Company and the factories that produce socks can find a way to produce durable, reinforced-sole socks. This would not only reduce the burden on consumers, but also save the country a lot of raw materials for making socks.　Tian Qing

    希望生产夹底袜子
    不久以前，我给两个孩子各买了两双花色很好看的棉纱袜子，心想两双新袜子大约可以穿过一两个月。谁知穿了还不到一星期，洗了二三次，袜子的底就破了。看着孩子穿上颜色还很新鲜的带补绽的袜子，心里很不舒服。不料隔壁的老太太又告诉我，她家的几个孩子新袜子穿上一次就得补，光补袜子就够她忙的。因此，我希望中国针织品公司和生产袜子的工厂，能够设法生产结实耐穿的夹底袜子，这样，既减轻了消费者的负担，又为国家节省了很多织袜的原料。　田青
