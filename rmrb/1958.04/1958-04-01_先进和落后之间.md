Between Advanced and Backward
    Tian Lianqian

Advanced and backward are opposing concepts, but there is no insurmountable gap between them. Under certain conditions, advanced can turn into backward, and backward can turn into advanced.

In the two years since cooperation, especially since last winter, the transformation between advanced and backward has become particularly rapid. Many regions and units that were not very advanced, or even backward, have leapt forward and become the most advanced. Meanwhile, some formerly advanced regions and units have appeared relatively slow, gradually seeming not very advanced or even backward. This situation exists in terms of crop yield per unit area, farmland water conservancy construction, tool reform and creation, afforestation, and sanitation work...

The accelerated mutual transformation of backward and advanced reflects the accelerated development and progress of the vast rural areas and agricultural production. Just as a high-speed run in a 100-meter race makes the difference between backward and advanced more apparent than a leisurely stroll. In the future, in the surging tide of production and construction, advanced and backward will transform rapidly and incessantly, and at an ever-increasing pace.

There are many specific conditions for the mutual transformation of backward and advanced. But in summary, the most important and fundamental are only two: one is revolutionary drive, and the other is working methods. With great drive and good methods, one can quickly transform from backward to advanced; with little drive and poor methods, the result is the opposite. Where does revolutionary drive come from? It comes from the improvement of political awareness and the surging of revolutionary enthusiasm, that is, boundless enthusiasm for socialism and the people. One must have full revolutionary enthusiasm to have sufficient revolutionary drive. Working methods, fundamentally, are a matter of the mass line. Whoever can truly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and constantly go deep into the masses to concentrate their wisdom and strength can do various things well. Otherwise, even with full revolutionary enthusiasm and drive, things will often be done badly. There are still many such examples now, which deserve attention.

After the high tide of water conservancy construction this year, what follows will be the high tide of striving for a bumper summer harvest and a bumper autumn harvest in 1958. For the sake of a bumper harvest, the main leading cadres of many provinces have led inspection teams to go deep into the grassroots to conduct a general inspection of spring plowing preparations and various specific agricultural activities such as spring irrigation of wheat fields and field management. It is difficult to find the main leaders in the offices. This is a very good phenomenon this year. This shows that all localities will greatly accelerate the pace of progress this year. And the result of acceleration will inevitably be a large number of new advanced units rapidly emerging. Who will they be? Perhaps many of them are the current backward units.

Advanced ones, run fast, be sure not to lose your red flag! Backward ones, run fast, you are fully capable of running to the front! Whoever does not want to lag behind in the great revolutionary competition must always maintain full revolutionary enthusiasm and drive, always maintain a clear head, and humbly learn from others. This should be the case for those running at the back of the line, and it should also be the case for those running at the head of the line. Wouldn't that mean we can never relax? Wouldn't that be too hard and too tense? Yes! We will be in a tense and arduous struggle for a long time. This is the original way of life for revolutionaries. If some people have not lived this way in the past, they must live this way in the future. Only this tense and enthusiastic battle life can give us the greatest pleasure!

    先进和落后之间
    田连阡
    先进和落后这两个概念是对立的，但它们之间并没有不可逾越的鸿沟。在一定的条件之下，先进可以转化为落后，落后也可以转化为先进。
    合作化以后两年来，尤其是去年冬季以来，先进和落后的转化显得特别迅速起来。许多原来不很先进的甚至是落后的地区和单位，飞跃而前，变成了最先进的地区和单位。而若干原来的先进地区和单位，却相形见慢，渐渐地显得不甚先进甚至落后了。在农作物的单位面积产量方面，兴修农田水利方面，工具改革和创造方面，植树造林和卫生工作方面……都有这种情形。
    落后和先进互相转化的加快，反映了广大农村和农业生产发展进步的加快。正如百米赛跑时的高速度前进比较散步式的低速度前进更易显出落后和先进。今后，在奔腾向前的生产和建设的浪潮中，先进和落后将永不停息地迅速转化，并且越来越快。
    落后和先进互相转化的具体条件很多。但归结起来，最主要的和最根本的只有两条：一条是革命干劲，一条是工作方法。干劲大，方法好，就能很快从落后变为先进；干劲小，方法不好，结果就相反。革命干劲何来？来自政治觉悟的提高和革命的热情澎湃，即对社会主义和对人民的无限热情。必须有饱满的革命热情，才能有充足的革命干劲。工作方法，则根本上是群众路线的问题。谁能够真正相信群众，依靠群众，经常深入到群众中去，集中群众的智慧和力量，谁就能办好各种事情。否则，即使有饱满的革命热情和干劲，也往往会把事情办坏。现在这种例子仍然不少，值得注意。
    本年度水利建设的高潮过去之后，紧接着来的将是争取1958年夏季大丰收和秋季大丰收的高潮。为了大丰收，好些省份的主要领导干部都率领检查团深入到基层普遍检查春耕准备和麦田春灌、田间管理等各项具体农事活动去了。机关里简直难得找到主要领导人。这是今年的大好现象。这是显示着今年各地都将大大地加快前进的步伐。而加快的结果，必然会有一大批新的先进单位迅速涌现。它们将是谁呢？也许其中有许多就是目前的落后单位。
    先进的，赶快跑，一定不要失掉自己的红旗！落后的，赶快跑，你们是完全有可能跑到前列去的！谁不愿意在革命的大竞赛中落伍，谁就必须永远保持饱满的革命热情和干劲，永远保持清醒的头脑，虚心向别人学习。跑在队尾的人们应当如此，跑在队首的人们也应当如此。这样岂不是永远都不能松一口气了么？岂不是太辛苦太紧张了么？是的！我们将长期处于紧张而辛苦的斗争之中。这就是革命者本来的生活方式。过去有些人如果不是这样生活，今后就必须这样生活。只有这种紧张而热烈的战斗的生活，才能给我们以最大的愉快！
