Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 18th: An international mass meeting against the threat of nuclear war and against the installation of American medium-range missile launch pads in Western Europe was held here last night at the Winter Velodrome. The meeting was attended by 15,000 Parisians, as well as famous peace defenders from France, West Germany, Japan, Denmark, India, Italy, Britain, and Canada.

The meeting was chaired by Eugénie Cotton. Arthur Betheson of the Danish Radical Party spoke first at the meeting, saying that his country and Norway had refused to establish American medium-range missile launch pads.

The speech by Malaviya, former Governor of Bhopal State, India, was warmly welcomed. He stressed that the people and government of India welcomed the Soviet Union's decision to stop nuclear weapons testing. He hoped that other major powers would follow the Soviet Union's example.

When Japanese young woman Ryoko Murata (transliteration) spoke, the crowd was emotional, and some were even moved to tears. She is a living witness to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and she still bears the scars left by this unprecedented bombing.

Reverend W. H. Wen, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, Luigi Cavalleri of the Italian Socialist Party, and Pastor Niemöller, a West German peace fighter, all spoke at the meeting about the anti-atomic weapons movement in their respective countries. Michael Randle, one of the organizers of the British anti-hydrogen bomb march, also spoke at the meeting.

Benoît Frachon, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, said: There are 160 million unionized workers in the world, one hundred million of whom are in Europe. If they unite and fight, they can constitute an invincible force, capable of opposing the establishment of missile launch pads in Western Europe. He announced: European workers will hold a meeting in mid-June to reaffirm their determination to oppose atomic weapons.

Finally, Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie, Chairman of the French Peace Council, spoke. He called on the French people to turn April 27th into a massive day of action against atomic death.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 18th: The Albanian National Peace Committee, workers, students, and residents held rallies on the 17th to protest the West German Bundestag's decision to equip the West German army with atomic weapons and rocket weapons.

Workers, students, and residents gathered in the streets angrily condemned this dangerous decision. They also telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, demanding that the United Nations immediately stop this illegal action. They believe that the main danger currently threatening the peace and security of Europe and the world is the rearmament of West German militarism.

On the same day, the Albanian Women's Union and the National Peace Committee sent protest telegrams to the West German Bundestag, and also sent telegrams to the Peace Council and the Democratic Women's Union of East Germany, and the Committee for the Defense of Peace in West Germany, calling on all peace-loving people and women in Germany to unite and fight against militarism and atomic armament.

    不准美国在西欧制造原子死亡
    巴黎举行国际性群众大会
    阿尔巴尼亚人民抗议西德原子武装
    据新华社巴黎18日电　昨天晚上在这里的冬季赛车场举行了一个反对核战争威胁、反对在西欧设置美国中程导弹发射台的国际性群众大会。参加大会的有一万五千个巴黎人，也有法国、西德、日本、丹麦、印度、意大利、英国和加拿大等国著名的和平保卫者。
    大会由欧仁妮·戈登主持。丹麦激进党的阿瑟·贝特尔森在会上首先发言，他说，他的国家和挪威都拒绝建立美国中程导弹发射台。
    印度波保尔邦前邦长马耳维亚的发言受到热烈欢迎。他着重指出，印度人民和政府都欢迎苏联决定停止试验核武器。他希望其它大国效法苏联的榜样。
    日本女青年村田良子（译音）发言时，群众情绪激动，有人甚至激动得流泪。她是广岛原子轰炸的活的见证人，她身上仍然带着在这次史无前例的轰炸中留下的伤痕。
    加拿大和平大会主席文幼章牧师、意大利社会党的吕琦·卡瓦莱里和西德和平战士尼埃莫勒牧师，都在会上谈到本国反对原子武器的运动。英国反对氢弹大游行的组织者之一迈克尔·雷德尔，也在会上发了言。
    法国总工会总书记贝诺瓦·弗拉商说：全世界有一亿六千万参加工会的工人，其中有一亿在欧洲。他们如果团结起来进行斗争，就能够构成一支无敌的力量，能够反对在西欧建立导弹发射台。他宣布：欧洲工人将在6月中旬举行会议来重申他们反对原子武器的决心。
    最后，法国和平理事会主席爱麦虞埃·达斯第埃—德拉维热里发言。他号召法国人变4月27日为声势浩大的反对原子死亡行动日。
    据新华社地拉那18日电　阿尔巴尼亚全国和平委员会、工人、学生和居民17日纷纷举行集会，抗议西德联邦议院关于用原子武器和火箭武器装备西德军队的决定。
    在街头上集会的工人、学生和居民们愤怒地谴责这一危险的决定。他们还致电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求联合国立即制止这一非法行动。他们认为，当前威胁欧洲和世界和平安全的主要危险就是重新武装西德军国主义。
    同一天，阿尔巴尼亚妇女联合会和全国和平委员会向西德联邦议院发出了抗议的电报，并且分别致电民主德国的和平理事会和民主妇女联合会以及西德的保卫和平委员会，呼吁全德爱好和平的人士和妇女们团结起来，为反对军国主义、反对原子武装而斗争。
