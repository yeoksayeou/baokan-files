Hongguang Cooperative Radiates Red Light

Chairman Mao's visit to the Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Pixian County, Sichuan, gave tremendous encouragement to all members of the cooperative. In order to respond to Chairman Mao's concern, they wrote a letter to Chairman Mao guaranteeing that this year's grain output would double that of last year. Top photo: Cooperative Director Zhou Guilin, following Chairman Mao's instructions, is applying foliar fertilizer to the "51" wheat to strive for a bumper harvest. Bottom photo: Female cooperative member Xu Jiaqun and other members are discussing the happy scene of meeting Chairman Mao. Photo by Liu Quanyu (Manuscript from Sichuan Peasant Daily)
