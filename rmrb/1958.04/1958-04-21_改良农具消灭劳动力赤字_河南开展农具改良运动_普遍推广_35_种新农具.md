Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th. Recently, the Standing Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the agricultural production situation in Henan Province and calculated a labor account. As of early April, the province had increased its area of paddy fields and irrigated land by more than 65.5 million mu. Adding the original 43 million mu, the total area reached more than 108 million mu, accounting for more than 80% of the province's total cultivated area. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, farmers across the province have accumulated more than 2 trillion jin of crude fertilizer, with an average application of nearly 20,000 jin per mu. The province plans to convert 15 million mu to rice cultivation this year, and to deep plow and improve 30 million mu of land before the wheat harvest. Due to the overall leap forward in agricultural production, labor shortages have become widespread. According to the Provincial Committee's investigation and statistics, the province is short 6.8 billion labor days in agricultural production this year. At present, the province has a total of more than 32,000 horsepower of power machinery such as tractors used in agricultural production, and plans to add more than 40,000 agricultural machines this year, totaling 480,000 horsepower. If all of it is used in agricultural production, it will only solve 190 million labor days, accounting for only 2.8% of the labor shortage. If advanced farm tools are promoted, the problem of labor shortage can be basically solved. Therefore, the Provincial Committee believes that launching the farm tool improvement campaign is of great significance and is the decisive key to ensuring a bumper harvest this year.

In order to rapidly launch this campaign, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial farm tool improvement conference in Xuchang from April 11 to 15. The conference criticized the idea of waiting for mechanization, exchanged experiences from the Xuchang area in mobilizing the masses to carry out farm tool reform, and formulated a plan for improving and promoting advanced farm tools.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th. At the provincial farm tool improvement conference recently held in Xuchang by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, thirty-five relatively advanced new farm tools have been selected.

Among these thirty-five advanced farm tools, seven are irrigation tools, sixteen are tillage tools, seven are transportation tools, and five are agricultural and sideline product processing tools. After comparison, appraisal, and testing, these farm tools all have great advantages. For example, the hand-cranked multi-tube waterwheel created by farmers in Yanling County can achieve the irrigation efficiency of three or four Liberation-style waterwheels. Farmers call this waterwheel "suffocating the boiler tractor." The manufacturing method of this waterwheel is relatively simple, and the cost is also relatively low; the cost of manufacturing one is less than half of that of a Liberation-style waterwheel. The improved double-wheeled double-shared plow in Xihua County requires half the original pulling force, and plows deeper and faster. Improving one costs only seven or eight jiao. Members of the Zengfumiao Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Changge County created a hand-cranked mill with very high flour milling efficiency. After an agricultural cooperative in Yuxian County imitated this mill, the milling efficiency of one mill surpassed that of the cooperative's previous twenty-six old mills. If this mill is promoted in Henan Province, it can save more than one million women's labor force a year. Among the advanced farm tools, there are also deep plowing double-wheeled double-shared plows, wind-powered waterwheels, three-row corn planters, close-planting cotton seeding drills, peanut planting and fertilizing machines, dryland land levelers, and steel-sleeved wooden frame carts. The efficiency of these tools is two to three times higher than that of ordinary old tools. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to rapidly promote these advanced farm tools throughout the province.

    改良农具消灭劳动力赤字
    河南开展农具改良运动　普遍推广35种新农具
    据新华社郑州20日电　最近中共河南省委常委会分析了河南省农业生产情况以后算了一笔劳力账。到4月上旬止，全省已经增加水地和水浇地六千五百五十多万亩，加上原来的四千三百万亩，总共有一亿零八百多万亩，占全省总耕地面积的80％以上。在积肥方面，全省农民已积粗肥两万多亿斤，每亩平均施肥量将近两万斤。全省今年计划改种水稻一千五百万亩，在麦收以前要深翻土地和改良土壤三千万亩。由于农业生产的全面跃进，各地普遍出现了劳动力不足的现象。根据省委的调查和统计，今年全省农业生产方面共缺少六十八亿个劳动日。现在全省用于农业生产的拖拉机等动力机械，共有三万二千多马力，计划今年增加农业机械四万多部，共有四十八万马力，如果全部用于农业生产，也只能解决一亿九千万个劳动日，仅占所缺劳动力的2.8％。如果推广先进的农具，就可以使劳动力不足的问题基本上得到解决。因此，省委认为开展农具改良运动具有重大的意义，它是保证今年农业大丰收的决定性的关键。
    为了迅速地开展这个运动，中共河南省委，从4月11日到15日，在许昌召开了全省农具改良会议。会议上批判了坐待机械化的思想，交流了许昌地区发动群众开展农具改革的经验，并制订了改良推广先进农具的规划。
    据新华社郑州20日电　中共河南省委最近在许昌召开的全省农具改良会议上，已经评选出三十五种比较先进的新式农具。
    这三十五种先进的农具，其中属于灌溉工具七种、耕作农具十六种、运输工具七种、农副产品加工工具五种。经过评比、鉴定和试验，这些农具都有很大的优点。例如鄢陵县农民创造的手摇多管水车，一部可以顶上三、四部解放式水车的浇地效率，农民叫这种水车是“气死锅驼机”，这种水车的制造方法比较简单，成本也比较低，制造一部的成本还不到一部解放式水车的一半。西华县的七改双轮双铧犁比原来的拉力要减轻一半，而且耕得深，耕得快，改一部只花七、八角钱。长葛县增福庙先进农业社的社员，创造出来的手摇磨，磨面效率很高；禹县有一个农业社仿制了这种磨以后，一盘磨的磨面效率就顶上全社过去二十六盘旧磨。如果这种磨在河南省推广，一年就可以节省一百多万个妇女劳动力。在先进的农具当中，还有深耕双轮双铧犁、风力水车、三行玉米播种机、密植棉花播种耧、花生播种施肥机、旱田平地机、钢套木制架子车等，这些工具的效率都比一般旧工具高两倍到三倍。中共河南省委决定在全省迅速推广这些先进的农具。
