    Everyone's Poems
    Everyone writes poems
    Everyone practices, practices, it's really good
    Everyone's poems, everyone reads
    This is our cultural station
    Everyone's poems, everyone comments
    Good poems spread throughout Beijing

    [The "Quyi Monthly" editorial department recently created a "street storytelling" board on the sidewalk at the north entrance of Wangfujing in Beijing. This poem by Comrade Lao She is the opening statement for the first issue.]
