    Let More Advanced Units and Advanced Individuals Emerge
    As the cause of socialist construction in rural areas throughout the country rapidly advances, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have decided to convene a national conference of representatives of advanced units in agricultural socialist construction in Beijing this winter. This will become a tremendous driving force for promoting socialist construction in rural areas, realizing the great leap forward in production in 1958, and achieving the "Agricultural Development Program" ahead of schedule. We wish that more counties and cities will achieve the grain yield target of "four, five, eight" mu per mu and the cotton yield target of one hundred jin of ginned cotton per mu this year ahead of schedule; we wish that more townships, agricultural cooperatives, and state farms in areas that should produce 800 jin and 400 or 500 jin, respectively, will reach 2,000 jin of grain and 1000 jin of grain and 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year; we wish that in all aspects, such as increasing oilseed production, water conservancy, afforestation, eliminating the four pests, improving agricultural tools, developing agricultural science and technology, developing forestry, animal husbandry, aquaculture, developing rural culture, education, health, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and commerce, more units and individuals will make particularly outstanding achievements.
    In the socialist era, the significance of advanced units, advanced individuals, advanced experiences, and advanced technologies is particularly significant. New things that require ten, dozens, or even hundreds of years to popularize in capitalist countries, or that may never be popularized, can be popularized on a large scale in just a few months in socialist countries. This is because the relationships between people, between regions, and between units are all relationships of sincere cooperation between comrades, rather than the relationships of mutual exploitation and mutual harm in capitalist countries. People are willing to use their new technologies and new experiences to help others, so that others can develop faster, rather than sealing up these new things and keeping them secret from each other. Here, the development and progress of any fraternal unit and neighboring region will make its own unit and its own region feel excited and happy. Because everyone has a common goal, which is to benefit the country and the people, and to build modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in our motherland.
    The emergence of advanced units will greatly accelerate the progress of the entire socialist cause. The dozens of counties (cities), townships, and cooperatives that had already achieved the grain yield of "four, five, eight" mu per mu and the cotton yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu ahead of schedule in 1957, as well as units that have made outstanding achievements in other aspects, have in fact become the great red flags of the whole country. They have pointed out the prospects for a great leap forward in agricultural production to the people of the whole country, opened up the minds and vision of the people of the whole country, and at the same time helped the whole country with their advanced experience, enabling those regions and units with the same conditions to learn the methods and strengthen their confidence and determination to achieve "four, five, eight" and other indicators ahead of schedule. This year, more regions and units, and even the whole country, will rise up to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced. Water conservancy has now been built many times more than in 1957, and fertilizer accumulation, afforestation, elimination of the four pests, and tool improvement are also advancing at a speed that people in the past could hardly imagine. The great socialist revolutionary competition is more enthusiastic, more popular, and more effective this year than in any previous year! Anyone who doubted the speed of China's agricultural progress in the past will feel great hope this year.
    The aspects of selecting advanced units and advanced individuals stipulated by the Party Central Committee and the State Council are very broad, and selections should be made in all aspects of grain, cotton, and oil crops, agriculture, forestry, water and animal husbandry, culture, education, health, commerce, and transportation. Here, it can be clearly seen that our party and country not only want their people to be well-fed and well-clothed, but also want to transform the entire rural landscape, turn the backward rural areas into advanced socialist rural areas, and enable our 500 million peasant masses to live a modern, civilized, and happy life. This is what countless people with lofty ideals have pursued for many years. We must turn these beautiful and grand ideals into reality in our own hands. This is the greatest cause in history!
    But we cannot indulge in beautiful ideals and advanced plans. We must try every means to find out various specific methods and measures to realize ideals and plans. So many projects have to strive to achieve on schedule or even ahead of schedule, and the leadership must have careful and scientific arrangements. For example, in order to produce more grain and cotton, water conservancy projects must strive to benefit in the current year, the amount of fertilizer must be increased, the quality must be improved, we must cultivate carefully and meticulously, improve technology, and some must also transform the soil (or deep plow the land), engage in soil and water conservation, plant trees and afforest, and so on. If any aspect is not done well, it is difficult to guarantee more grain and cotton. And all of these require someone to do it. How to organize labor, how to allocate and use it, all of this must be considered uniformly. This is very much like fighting a general war, and all aspects of the sea, land, and air must cooperate. If one aspect does not cooperate, we cannot win a great victory.
    Looking far ahead must be combined with starting near. What needs special attention at the moment is to strive for a bumper harvest of summer-ripening crops such as wheat and rapeseed. This requires special attention to current urgent matters such as spring irrigation and field management. If this move is not grasped tightly, the annual target will fall through due to the failure of the summer harvest. Similarly, in order to have a bumper autumn harvest, the leadership and inspection of spring plowing preparation and spring sowing work are of particular importance. Now the main leading comrades (provincial party secretaries, etc.) of many provinces are personally leading inspection teams to go deep into townships and cooperatives to check the actual situation and measures, help comrades below solve specific problems, overcome difficulties, and carry out specific organizational work. This is the greatest guarantee to prevent failure. All leading organs and leaders at all levels should do this. Bureaucratic work style must be resolutely eliminated.
    Inspection activities need to be combined with visit and evaluation activities. When inspecting a unit, some places bring representatives from many units to visit at the same time, evaluate each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses. This is the most effective way to promptly promote good practices, promote advanced technologies and experiences, and avoid mistakes and detours. This method has now been widely used in various places, but it is still necessary to pay attention to using it frequently, and not to be tight and loose from time to time. Even advanced units need to pay attention to the strengths of others, learn with an open mind, and be diligent in visiting. Only in this way can we always maintain the speed of progress and always stand in an invincible position.
    The innovation and creation of production tools has become a widespread mass movement in many places, and has even reached the point where every township has creations and every cooperative has improvements. This is the budding of an agricultural technological revolution. We must actively lead and organize the current mass tool reform movement to make it develop faster and better. Tool reform is the main sign of the development of social productive forces, and it is also the real way out to overcome the current labor difficulties. Now many counties have put forward plans to strive for preliminary mechanization, semi-mechanization, and electrification in a few years, and the leading organs of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should give active assistance and support. We should not regard the mechanization and electrification of agriculture as too mysterious or too far away. Sudden change is the result of gradual change, and qualitative change is the result of quantitative change. We cannot hope that one day in the future we will suddenly rely on the state to mechanize all agriculture, but only seize the present, seize the already emerging tool reform movement, guide it according to the situation, and rely on the wisdom and human and material resources of the broad masses of the people to lead this movement to a great revolution in agricultural technology, to mechanization. In fact, not only have ten-row strip seeders and various machines that improve efficiency several times or even dozens of times appeared in various places, but also small power machines such as tractors have been spontaneously created. Small hydropower and thermal power stations, wind-powered tools, and biogas power are constantly emerging.
    Social revolution plus technological revolution, the reform of production relations plus the reform of production tools, this is the road for our country to build modern agriculture.
    The season for large-scale production has begun. We hope that in all aspects, such as striving for a bumper summer harvest, a bumper autumn harvest, afforestation, eliminating the four pests, and tool reform, more and more outstanding advanced units and advanced individuals will emerge this year.

    让更多的先进单位和先进人物出现
    正当全国各地农村社会主义建设事业急速地向前发展的时候，中共中央和国务院决定今年冬季在北京召开全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议。这对于促进农村社会主义建设，实现1958年生产大跃进以及提前实现农业发展纲要，都将成为巨大的推动力量。我们预祝今年有更多的县市提前实现“四、五、八”的粮食亩产指标和一百斤皮棉的棉花亩产指标；预祝属于应产八百斤和四百斤、五百斤的地区有更多的乡、农业社和国营农场，在今年分别达到亩产粮食二千斤和一千斤，皮棉二百斤；预祝在增产油料、水利化、绿化、除四害、改良农具、发展农业科学技术、发展林业、牧业、水产业、发展农村文教卫生、交通邮电和商业等各方面，都有更多的单位和个人做出特殊优异的成绩。
    在社会主义的时代，先进单位、先进人物、先进经验和先进技术的意义是特别重大的。在资本主义国家需要十来年、几十年、上百年才能普及、甚至永远不能普及的新东西，在社会主义国家简直只要几个月就可以在很大范围内普及。因为现在人与人、地区与地区、单位与单位的关系，都是同志之间真诚协作的关系，而不是资本主义国家那种互相倾轧和互相危害的关系。人们都愿意用自己的新技术新经验去帮助别人，使别人更快地发展，而不是把这些新东西密封起来，互相保密。在这里，任何兄弟单位和友邻地区的发展和进步，都会使自己单位和自己地区感到兴奋和愉快。因为大家有一个共同的目的，就是造福于国家和人民，在我们祖国建设现代工业、现代农业、现代的科学和文化。
    先进单位的出现，将使整个社会主义事业的进度大大加快。1957年已经出现的几十个提前实现了粮食亩产“四、五、八”和亩产百斤皮棉的县（市），亩产量更高得多的乡和社，以及在其他方面有优异成绩的单位，事实上已经成了全国的大红旗。它们给全国人民指出了农业生产大跃进的前景，打开了全国人民的思想和眼界，同时用自己的先进经验帮助了全国，使那些具备同样条件的地区和单位学到了办法，坚定了提前实现“四、五、八”和其他指标的信心和决心。今年，更多的地区和单位以至全国，都将纷纷起来学先进，赶先进。水利，现在已经比1957年多修了好多倍，积肥、绿化、除四害、工具改良也在以过去人们难以想像的速度向前猛进。社会主义的革命大竞赛，今年比过去任何一年都更为热烈，更加具有广大的群众性，也更有实效！任何过去怀疑我国农业前进速度的人，今年都会感到大有希望的。
    党中央和国务院所规定的选拔先进单位和先进人物的方面非常广泛，粮棉油料、农林水牧、文教卫生，商业，交通各方面都要选拔。这里很明显地可以看到，我们的党和国家不仅是要自己的人民吃饱穿暖，而且是要整个改造农村面貌，把落后的农村变为先进的社会主义农村，使我们的五亿农民群众大家都能过现代化的文明幸福生活。这是多少年来无数志士仁人所追求的东西。这些美好的远大的理想，我们要在自己手里把它化为现实。这是历史上最伟大的事业了！
    但我们不能沉溺于美丽的理想和先进的计划。我们要千方百计寻找出实现理想和计划的各种具体的方法和措施。这样多的项目都要争取如期实现以至提前实现，领导上就不能没有仔细的科学的安排。比如说，为了多产粮棉，水利工程要争取当年受益，肥料的数量要加大，质量要提高，要精耕细作，改进技术，有的还要改造土壤（或深翻耕地），搞水土保持、植树造林等一大套。任何一方面搞不好，就很难保证多产粮棉。而这些又都是需要有人去做的。劳动力怎样组织，怎样分配使用，这一切都必须统一考虑。这很像是打一场总体战，海陆空哪一方面都得配合上。有一方面配合不上就打不了大胜仗。
    远处着眼，要同近处着手结合起来。眼下特别需要注意的，是争取小麦和油菜等夏熟作物的大丰收。这就需要对春灌和田间管理等当前急务特别抓紧。这一着抓不紧，全年的指标就会因夏季不能丰收而落空。同样，为了秋季丰收，春耕准备工作和春播工作的领导和检查就具有特别重大的意义。现在好些省的主要领导同志（省委书记等）都亲自率领检查团深入到乡和社去检查实际情况和措施，帮助下面同志解决具体问题，克服困难，进行具体的组织工作，这是防止落空的最大的保证。各级所有的领导机关和领导人都应当这样做。官风必须坚决扫掉。
    检查的活动，需要同参观评比的活动结合起来。有些地方在检查某单位的时候，把好多单位的代表同时带来参观，互相评比，取长补短，这在及时推广好的做法、推广先进技术和经验上以及避免错误和弯路上都是最有实效的。各地现在已经在普遍运用这种方法，但还需要注意经常用，不要时紧时松。即使是先进的单位，也需要经常注意别人的长处，虚心学习，勤于参观。只有这样，才能永远保持前进的速度，永远立于不败之地。
    生产工具的革新和创造，在许多地方已经成为广大群众性的运动，甚至达到了乡乡有创造，社社有改良。这是农业技术革命的萌芽。我们要十分积极地领导和组织目前群众性的工具改革运动，使它更快地更好地向前发展。工具改革是社会生产力发展的主要标志，也是克服目前劳力困难的真正出路。现在好些县份已经提出几年内争取初步机械化半机械化和电气化的计划，省市和自治区的领导机关应当给以积极的协助和支持。我们对农业的机械化和电气化不应当看得太神秘，太遥远。突变是渐变的结果，质变是量变的结果。我们不能希望将来有那么一天忽然一下子就依靠国家把全部农业机械化了，而只能抓住现在，抓住已经出现的工具改革运动，因势利导，依靠广大人民群众的智慧和人力物力，把这一运动引向农业技术的大革命，引向机械化。事实上，现在各地不仅出现了十来行的条播机，效率提高好几倍甚至几十倍的各种机械，而且自发地造出了小型的动力机械如拖拉机等。小的水力火力发电站，风动工具，以及沼气动力，都在不断地涌现出来。
    社会革命加上技术革命，生产关系的改革加上生产工具的改革，这就是我国建设现代农业的道路。
    大生产季节已经开始，我们希望在争取夏季大丰收、秋季大丰收、绿化、除四害、工具改革等各个方面，都在今年涌现出更多的更出色的先进单位和先进人物。
