    This newspaper reports: Guizhou Province's Public Security Bureau, in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, exposed and criticized the "five airs" of leadership, and work efficiency greatly improved. The Second Division originally planned to complete its workload for the first half of 1958, but in the movement, it only took two days to complete half of the originally planned workload—solving and clarifying sixteen backlog cases. The most important reasons for the increased work efficiency are the collaboration between superiors and subordinates, internal and external parties, and various departments, as well as the enthusiasm of all cadres. Interrogation work, file-clearing work, and technical appraisal work all exceeded the regular rate by three, four, or even five times.

    上下里外结合　办案效率提高
    贵州公安厅工作出现新气象
    本报讯  贵州省公安厅在反浪费反保守运动中，揭发和批判了领导上的五气以后，工作效率大大提高。二处原计划1958年上半年完成的工作量，在运动中只两天时间就完成原订工作量的一半——破获和查明了十六起积案。工作效率提高的最重要的原因是上下里外和各部门之间的协作与全体干部的积极性。审讯工作，清理档案工作，技术鉴定工作都超过常规三倍、四倍、甚至五倍。
