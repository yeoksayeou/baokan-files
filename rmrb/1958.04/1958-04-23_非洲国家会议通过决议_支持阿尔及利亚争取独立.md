Xinhua News Agency, Accra, April 22nd: The Secretariat of the Conference of Independent African States issued the final resolution of the conference on the Algerian issue on the evening of the 21st. The resolution announced support for Algeria's struggle for independence, demanded that France withdraw all its troops from Algeria and negotiate with the Algerian National Liberation Front, and demanded that France's allies not directly or indirectly assist France in its military operations in Algeria.

The resolution said that despite the United Nations adopting many resolutions and appeals calling for a peaceful solution to the Algerian issue, and the heads of Morocco and Tunisia proposing mediation, the war in Algeria continues, and France still refuses to grant the Algerian people the right to independence and self-determination, which makes the conference deeply uneasy.

The resolution said that the situation in Algeria threatens international peace, especially the security of Africa. The resolution announced:
    (1) Recognize the Algerian people's right to independence and self-determination;
    (2) Express regret for the severity of the hostilities and the bloodshed caused by the continuation of the Algerian war;
    (3) Demand that France: (A) recognize the Algerian people's right to independence and self-determination, (B) cease hostilities and withdraw all its troops from Algeria, (C) immediately hold peaceful negotiations with the Algerian National Liberation Front to reach a final and just solution;
    (4) Call on all peace-loving countries to exert moral pressure on France to adopt policies that conform to the principles of the United Nations Charter;
    (5) Call on France's friends and allies not to directly or indirectly assist France in its military operations in Algeria;
    (6) Affirm its determination to do everything possible to assist the Algerian people in achieving independence;
    (7) Recommend that the governments of independent African states with representatives in the United Nations instruct their respective national representatives to the United Nations to consult each other regularly, explain the true situation in Algeria to the member states of the United Nations, request their support for a just and peaceful solution, and suggest to the independent African states some measures that may need to be taken from time to time, in particular, to find ways for the independent African states to make world opinion aware of the Algerian situation, including sending a delegation to the capitals of the world as soon as possible to seek the support of the governments of the world.

    决议说，尽管联合国通过了许多要求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的决议和呼吁，摩洛哥和突尼斯两国首脑提出了斡旋建议，但是阿尔及利亚的战争仍在继续进行，法国仍然拒绝给予阿尔及利亚人民以独立和自决的权利，这使会议深感不安。

      （一）承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立和自决权；
      （二）对于敌对行动的严重程度和由于阿尔及利亚战争继续进行而产生的流血表示遗憾；
      （三）要求法国：（甲）承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立和自决权利，（乙）停止敌对行为，并且从阿尔及利亚撤出它的全部军队，（丙）立即同阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线举行和平谈判，以达成最后的公正的解决办法；
      （四）号召一切爱好和平的国家对法国施加道义压力，使它采取符合联合国宪章的原则的政策；
    （五）号召法国的友邦和盟国不要直接或间接地帮助法国在阿尔及利亚的军事行动；
      （六）肯定表明决心要尽一切力量来协助阿尔及利亚人民实现独立；
      （七）建议在联合国驻有代表的各非洲独立国家的政府指示各自的国家驻联合国的代表经常互相磋商，向联合国各会员国阐明阿尔及利亚的真实情况和请求他们支持公正和和平的解决办法，并且向非洲各独立国家建议一些可能不时需要采取的措施，特别是找出非洲各独立国家能让世界舆论明了阿尔及利亚局势的办法，包括尽快派出一个代表团到世界各国首都去争取世界各国政府的支持。
