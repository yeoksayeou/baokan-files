Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 15th — The Guizhou Rubber Factory has begun construction in Guiyang and is expected to be put into production by the end of the year. It will be able to produce tires for large trucks, tractors, three-wheeled vehicles, motorcycles, horse-drawn carts, and bicycles. It will also be able to retread old tires and make rubber accessories.

The raw materials for the Guizhou Rubber Factory will initially rely mainly on state allocation, and will gradually be sourced locally in the future. According to investigations by relevant departments, there are many kinds of wild plants in the mountainous areas of Guizhou that can be used to extract rubber. The yam produced in Luodian County alone amounts to hundreds of thousands of catties each year. Recently, two more counties have discovered a large number of "rubber vines," which are initially estimated to be able to produce more than 100,000 catties of rubber latex annually.

    贵州兴建橡胶厂
    新华社贵阳15日电　贵州橡胶厂在贵阳市动工兴建，预计年底可以投入生产。它能生产大卡车、拖拉机、三轮汽车、摩托车、马车、自行车上用的轮胎，同时能把旧胎翻成新胎，和作橡胶配件工作。
    贵州橡胶厂的原料开始将主要靠国家配给，以后逐步做到就地取材。据有关部门调查，贵州山区各地能提炼橡胶的野生植物种类很多。仅罗甸县出产的薯莨每年就有几十万斤。最近又有两个县发现了大批“橡胶藤”，初步估计可年产十多万斤胶浆。
