(Dispatch from Guangzhou) Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhao Ziyang, Secretary of the Secretariat, hope that all localities, while doing a good job in field management such as weeding, topdressing fertilizer, and irrigation, will vigorously launch sideline production in agricultural cooperatives and appropriately take care of the sideline production of commune members' families.

From the 9th to the 12th, Comrades Tao Zhu and Zhao Ziyang learned about the situation of several cooperatives in Xinhui County. Comrade Tao Zhu personally went to the Duhui Cooperative in Huancheng Township for discussions with township and cooperative cadres. When talking about the winter and spring production situation, everyone believed that this year's rice seedlings were the best they had ever seen. Rice transplanting work was done early, quickly, and well. In half the time compared to last year, they completed twice as much transplanting work as last year. Now the rice seedlings are several inches high, growing neatly and strongly. Everyone unanimously believed that this year's spring plowing production has passed three hurdles (water conservancy, fertilizer, and close planting). If we carefully manage the field management hurdles of weeding, topdressing fertilizer, and irrigation, and prevent the early rice from lodging, increased production is guaranteed. When talking about the arrangement of farm work for the period after rice transplanting, everyone agreed with the Provincial Party Committee's proposal to focus on field management such as weeding, topdressing fertilizer, and irrigation, while also giving more prominence to the cooperative's sideline production and family sideline production.

Comrades Tao Zhu and Zhao Ziyang also expressed their opinions. They believed that: This year, the rice is planted very densely. If weeding and topdressing fertilizer are not done immediately after transplanting, it will be difficult to carry out these tasks when the seedlings grow taller. Irrigation must be timely. Cooperatives with the conditions must achieve frequent and shallow irrigation, and timely drainage, otherwise lodging is likely to occur. At the same time, it is necessary to make a maximum effort to launch a rush on the cooperative's sideline production, and also appropriately take care of family sideline production. In the upsurge of agricultural capital construction last winter and this spring, the Party committees at all levels adhered to the policy of comprehensive economic development, greatly developed capital construction, and also appropriately grasped sideline production, thus avoiding the shortcomings of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting sideline production in 1956. However, at that time, because the task of agricultural capital construction was several times greater than in previous years, it was impossible and should not be to emphasize sideline production with greater energy. Now the conditions have changed. The busy season of rice transplanting has passed. After another ten days of hard work to remove weeds, apply fertilizer well, and organize specialized personnel to manage irrigation, we can shift to general field management. We should and can now use more energy to launch a rush on sideline production.

They said that under the premise of adhering to the development of agriculture as the main focus, it is of great significance to develop the cooperative's collective sideline occupations faster and better. This year's achievements in agricultural infrastructure construction are so great, and the benefits to farmers in the future are clear to everyone. But from the perspective of immediate interests, it is absolutely necessary to appropriately increase the income of commune members this year. Because there was too much labor used for infrastructure construction this year, and these work points cannot be recovered in one year; moreover, some cooperatives are currently experiencing difficulties in capital turnover, and commune members feel a lack of pocket money. Therefore, taking advantage of the opportunity to launch a rush on sideline production and increase some income will benefit both the cooperative and the commune members.

When talking about how to combine other rural work (such as wheelbarrowization, leveling land, building terraces, afforestation, water conservancy, eliminating the four pests, eliminating illiteracy, and general elections) with the current central work, Comrades Tao Zhu and Zhao Ziyang pointed out: Other work must be carried out on the premise of ensuring good production and increasing sideline income, and resolutely postpone some work that is temporarily allowed to be delayed.

    陶铸同志和社员协商安排当前农事活动
    管理稻田  突击副业
    本报广州电　中共广东省委第一书记陶铸、书记处书记赵紫阳希望各地在做好除草、追肥、排灌等田间管理的同时，用大力突击农业社的副业生产，适当照顾社员家庭副业生产。
    9日到12日，陶铸、赵紫阳同志在新会县了解了几个社的情况，陶铸同志曾亲去环城乡都会社与乡社干部进行座谈。谈到冬春生产情况时，大家都认为今年的秧苗是从来没有看过的好秧。插秧工作进行得又早又快又好。用比去年少一半的时间，完成了比去年多一倍的插秧任务。现在稻苗已经几寸高了，长得齐整、壮实。大家一致认为：今年春耕生产已经过了三关（水利、肥料、密植），以后小心过好除草、追肥、排灌的田间管理关，早稻不倒伏，增产便拿定了。谈到插秧后一段时间的农活安排，大家同意省委提出的在集中力量做好除草、追肥、排灌等田间管理的同时，把社的副业生产和家庭副业生产放得突出些。
    陶铸、赵紫阳同志也发表了意见，他们认为：今年秧插得很密，插秧后不立刻搞好除草、追肥，秧苗长高了就很难进行这些工作。排灌更须及时，有条件的社必须做到勤灌、浅灌，适时排干，否则容易发生倒伏。与此同时，用最大力量突击一下社的副业，也需要适当照顾一下家庭副业。在去冬今春农业基本建设高潮中，各级党委坚持了全面发展经济的方针，大大发展了基本建设，同时也适当地抓了副业生产，因而避免了1956年重农业轻副业的缺点。但是，在当时由于农业基本建设任务几倍大于往年，不可能也不应该以更大精力去强调副业生产。现在条件变了，插秧大忙已经过去，再苦战十天左右，把草除净，把肥追好，排灌组织专人掌握，即可转入一般性的田间管理，我们便应该也有可能用较大力量突击副业生产。
    他们说，在坚持发展农业为主的条件下，更快更好地发展社的集体副业，是有极大意义的。今年农业基建成绩这样巨大，将来对农民的好处是那个人都看得清楚的。但从眼前利益说，今年社员的收入能适当增加也是绝对必要的。因为今年基建用工太多，而这些工值是一年拿不回来的；何况有些社目前资金周转已有困难，社员零用钱也感到缺乏。因此，利用时机突击一下副业生产，增加一部分收入，对社和社员都有好处。
    在谈到农村其它工作（如车子化、整平土地、修筑梯田、造林、水利、除四害、扫盲、普选等）和当前中心工作怎样结合的时候，陶铸和赵紫阳同志指出：其它工作都必须在保证搞好生产，增加副业收入的前提下进行，坚决地将一些暂时允许缓办的工作推到后边去。
