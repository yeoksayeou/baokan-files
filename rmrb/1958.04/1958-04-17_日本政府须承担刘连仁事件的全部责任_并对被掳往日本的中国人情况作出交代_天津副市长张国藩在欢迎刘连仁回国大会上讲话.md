Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 16th. The full text of the speech by Zhang Guofan, Vice Mayor of Tianjin, at the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress welcoming compatriot Liu Lianren back to China is as follows: Fellow compatriots, friends:

　　Today’s gathering is no ordinary one. Compatriot Liu Lianren, who suffered for fourteen years in Japan, has returned to Tianjin. Today, the party, government, military, and people of Tianjin are holding a rally to welcome him, and to welcome other returned overseas Chinese. Allow me, on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal People’s Committee, to extend brotherly greetings and congratulations to our dear compatriot, Liu Lianren. We sympathize with the hardships you endured in Japan and congratulate you on returning to the motherland and reuniting with your family. Ever since we heard the news of your discovery in Japan, we have been constantly concerned about your safety and health, hoping that you would return to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. Today, seeing you sitting with us, we are relieved and very happy, but we are also very angry at the Japanese government’s unreasonable denials. This is not just the sentiment of the people of Tianjin, but also the shared feeling of the people across the country.

　　Liu Lianren was abducted to Japan by the Japanese army in 1944 and forced to perform hard labor. In order to escape the cruel slavery, abuse, and persecution, he fled to the remote mountains of Hokkaido, where he lived an inhuman life, isolated from society, for thirteen years, enduring all kinds of suffering. However, he persisted in fighting against Japanese militarists and difficulties until today. His will and courage are worthy of admiration by each and every one of us.

　　The fact that Liu Lianren was able to quickly and safely return to the motherland after being discovered is primarily due to the concern and importance attached to him by our government and people, who resolutely demanded that the Japanese government bear full responsibility for Liu Lianren. Secondly, it is due to the sincere sympathy, help, and support given by the Japanese people and overseas Chinese in Japan. We express our heartfelt gratitude for this friendly action by the Japanese people.

　　Liu Lianren has been abroad for fourteen years. Upon his return, he finds that the face of the motherland is completely new, and that fundamental changes have taken place in all aspects. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have not only driven away the Japanese militarists and overthrown the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism, but our motherland has also been transformed into an independent, free, strong, and vibrant socialist country. We, the people of the whole country, are proud of this, and peace-loving people all over the world are pleased with the great progress of our motherland. However, there are still a small number of people in the world, including some responsible figures in the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government and ruling party, who turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to the fundamental changes in China and the world situation, and still hold the old attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people, which we absolutely cannot tolerate.

　　As everyone knows, the Japanese militarists committed heinous crimes during their invasion of China, bringing profound disasters, endless suffering, and inestimable losses to the Chinese people. A large number of innocent civilians were abducted to Japan by the Japanese army and forced to perform labor. The Liu Lianren incident is just one of the thousands of crimes committed by the Japanese militarists. At that time, our compatriots who were abducted to Japan were treated like prisoners and slaves, forced to do hard labor under extremely harsh conditions. Not only were they deprived of their personal freedom, but they were also not guaranteed even the most basic conditions for survival. They were underfed, poorly clothed, and denied medical treatment when they were sick, resulting in a large number of deaths. If they could not bear it and tried to escape such abuse, they would be shot. The notorious Hanoka massacre is an example of such brutal crimes. Many of the abducted compatriots are still missing to this day. All of this is a blood debt owed by Japanese militarism to the Chinese people. Kishi Nobusuke, who was a member of the cabinet at the time, also bears an undeniable responsibility. However, thirteen years have passed since the end of the war, and the Japanese government, with Kishi Nobusuke as prime minister, has shown no remorse whatsoever and has not provided any explanation for this matter. On the contrary, when Liu Lianren was discovered, the Japanese government not only did not apologize for such an act of violence committed by Japanese militarism, which violated humanitarian principles and international laws, but also falsely accused Liu Lianren of “illegal entry,” attempting to subject him to new persecution. On March 25, Itagaki Osamu, Director-General of the Asian Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, even falsely claimed in response to inquiries in the Senate that Liu Lianren was not abducted but was working in Hokkaido based on a "contract." We are deeply indignant at the Japanese government’s attitude of distorting the facts in an attempt to deny and evade responsibility. The insidious tactics and unreasonable arguments employed by the Kishi Nobusuke government in the Liu Lianren incident make us feel that it is truly a continuation of the past Japanese imperialism. From this perspective, it is not surprising that the Kishi Nobusuke government recently openly violated the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. However, we must solemnly warn the Japanese government that it should face the facts as soon as possible. China is no longer the China of twenty years ago. Our country will not tolerate any infringement on our people. Now that Liu Lianren has returned, the Japanese government must bear full responsibility for this incident and compensate Liu Lianren for all his losses. The Japanese government should also provide a responsible explanation of the situation of all Chinese people abducted by the Japanese army during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

　　On the other hand, we would like to express our gratitude to the friends of the escort team of the remains of martyrs who died in Japan, who are participating in today's conference, and through them, to extend our greetings to the Japanese people. Thanks to their efforts, more than 2,000 sets of remains have been returned in the past five years, and more than 100 sets have been returned this time. This is a concrete manifestation of the Japanese people's active promotion of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. The Chinese people cherish this friendly behavior very much. The Chinese people have always held friendly wishes towards the Japanese people and will never change because of the Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude of hostility towards China. We are willing to join hands with the Japanese people forever to make beneficial contributions to the prosperity and happiness of China and Japan and to the peace of Asia and the world.

    日本政府须承担刘连仁事件的全部责任
    并对被掳往日本的中国人情况作出交代
    天津副市长张国藩在欢迎刘连仁回国大会上讲话
    新华社天津16日电　天津市副市长张国藩在天津市各界欢迎难胞刘连仁回国大会上的讲话，全文如下：各位同胞，各位朋友：
    今天在这里举行的是一个不平常的集会。在日本受尽苦难十四年的难胞刘连仁回到了天津，我们天津市党政军民各界今天开大会欢迎他，同时欢迎其他回国的侨胞。让我首先代表天津市人民委员会，向我们亲爱的同胞刘连仁，表示兄弟般的慰问和祝贺。慰问你在日本受了千辛万苦，祝贺你重返祖国和家人团聚。我们自从听到你在日本被发现的消息以后，无时无刻不在关心你的安全和健康，盼望你能早日回到祖国的怀抱。今天看到你和我们坐在一起，我们放心了，我们感到很高兴，但我们对日本政府的无理狡赖，同时也感到很气愤。这不仅仅是天津市人民的心情，同时也是全国人民具有同感的心情。
    刘连仁在1944年被日本军队掳到日本，强迫进行苦役劳动。他为了摆脱残酷的奴役、虐待和迫害，逃到北海道的荒山里，渡过了十三年与社会隔绝的非人生活，受尽了各种苦难，但是他坚持向日本军国主义者和困难作斗争一直到今天。他的意志和勇气，是值得我们每一个人钦佩的。
    刘连仁被发现后能够很快地安全回到祖国，这首先是由于我们的政府和人民的关怀和重视，坚决要求日本政府对刘连仁负以全部责任。其次是由于日本人民和旅日侨胞给予真诚的同情帮助和支援。对日本人民这种友好的行动，我们表示衷心的感谢。
    刘连仁在国外十四年，这次回来，祖国的面貌全新，在各方面都起了根本的变化，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，不仅赶走了日本军国主义者，推翻了美帝国主义走狗蒋介石的反动统治，而且我们的祖国已经转变成为一个独立自由、强大、生气勃勃的社会主义国家，我们全国人民因而自豪，全世界爱好和平的人民也以我们祖国的伟大进步而感到高兴。但是世界上还有一小部分人，包括日本岸信介政府和执政党中一部分负责人士在内，他们对中国和世界形势的根本变化熟视无睹、充耳不闻，仍然抱着以前的老态度敌视中国人民，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。
    大家知道，日本军国主义者在侵华期间曾经犯下了滔天罪行，给中国人民带来了深重的灾难、无穷的痛苦和难以估价的损失。大批无辜的贫民被日本军队劫掳到日本去强迫进行劳役，刘连仁事件也就是日本军国主义者千万件罪行中的一件。当时，我们的同胞被劫掳到日本以后，形同囚犯和奴隶，在极端恶劣的条件下作苦工，不仅人身不得自由，连最低的生存条件也得不到保证，吃不饱，穿不暖，病了不得医治，因而造成大批的死亡。如果不堪忍受，要逃出这样的虐待，就要遭到枪杀，有名的花岗惨案，就是这种凶残罪行的例证。许多被掳去的同胞，直到今天还下落不明，所有这些，都是日本军国主义欠下中国人民的血债。当时内阁成员之一的岸信介，也负有不可推卸的责任。但是，战争结束十三年过去了，以岸信介为首相的日本政府丝毫也没有忏悔之意，对这件事没有作任何交代，相反的当刘连仁被发现以后，日本政府对日本军国主义所犯下的这样一件违反人道原则和国际法规的暴行，不仅不表示谢罪，反而诬称刘连仁有“非法入境嫌疑”，企图对他进行新的迫害，日本外务省亚洲局局长板垣修3月25日在参议院答复询问时，竟又诡称刘连仁不是被劫掳去的而是根据“合同”在北海道作劳工的。我们对于日本政府这种颠倒黑白企图抵赖逃避责任的狡辩态度，感到十分愤慨。岸信介政府在刘连仁事件上所玩弄的阴险手法和蛮横无理的论调，使我们感觉到和过去的日本帝国主义真像是一脉相承的。这样看来，最近岸信介政府公然破坏中日第四次贸易协定，也不是什么奇怪的事了。但是，我们必须正告日本政府，应该及早面对事实，中国已经不是二十年前的中国了，我们的国家不容许对我国人民进行任何侵害，现在刘连仁虽然已经回来了，但是日本政府必须承担这一事件的全部责任，赔偿刘连仁的一切损失，日本政府还应当对侵华战争期间被日本军队掳去的所有中国人的情况，作出负责的交代。
    可是，另一方面，我们要对参加今天大会的在日殉难烈士遗骨护送团的各位朋友，表示感谢，并通过他们向日本人民致意。由于他们的努力，五年来已送回遗骨二千多具，这次又送回一百多具，这是日本人民为积极促进中日两国人民友谊的具体表现。中国人民非常珍视这种友好的行为，中国人民对日本人民始终抱着友好的愿望，绝不会因为岸信介政府敌视中国的态度而有所改变。我们愿意永远和日本人民携起手来，为中日两国的繁荣幸福，为亚洲和世界和平，作出有利的贡献。
