The Greatest Glory and Inspiration
Chairman Mao Meets Qinqiang Opera Actors in Changchun
Li Zheming

On February 14th, although the surroundings of the Changchun Film Studio were still covered in white snow, the cold winter seemed to have quietly passed. Comrades from the Qinqiang Opera Film Troupe from the Northwest region welcomed this early spring with joy.

Around noon, close to twelve o'clock, the actors of "Flame Colt" (火焰驹), Xiao Yuling, Li Yingzhen, Xiao Ruolan, and others were recording in the recording studio. A guest suddenly appeared at the side door of the audition room. The guest was wearing a gray overcoat, full of energy, with a calm and amiable demeanor. Accompanied by Director Ya Ma, he slowly entered the room. In that instant, everyone was stunned by the sudden arrival of this distinguished guest. The actors forgot to sing, the orchestra forgot to accompany, and everyone stared in amazement at this guest who looked familiar but had never been seen before. After a long while, everyone seemed to wake up from a dream and shouted in unison, "Chairman Mao!" The comrades applauded warmly to welcome him. At this time, Chairman Mao frequently raised his hand to express his thanks and walked into the recording room to shake hands with the comrades one by one. When Chairman Mao heard the director introduce that these were actors and staff from Shaanxi who came to film the Qinqiang opera "Flame Colt," he said very happily to the actors: "Oh! You came from Shaanxi to film the Qinqiang opera film, very good." It can be seen how much Chairman Mao cares about and feels close to Shaanxi!

Who would have thought of meeting Chairman Mao here? But this was absolutely true, and now he was standing face to face with everyone talking. Before he left the recording studio, he also took a group photo with the actors. At this time, there was a musician in the orchestra of the Qinqiang Opera Film Troupe who had almost completely lost his sight. Only when his eyes were close to things could he vaguely see a glimmer of light. In fact, he was practically a blind person. When he heard that Chairman Mao had come, he was extremely anxious and wanted to see Chairman Mao's face. He squeezed next to Chairman Mao, and although he did not see him, he saw Chairman Mao's overcoat. He was extremely happy and told everyone that his eyes were not blind, and that he had seen Chairman Mao. Wang, who played the erhu, and Shi, who played the horn, were so moved that they shed tears. They said: "Without him, how could we have such a good life today." Many young comrades jumped for joy.

When Chairman Mao walked out of the recording studio, the courtyard was already surrounded by comrades from the Changchun Film Studio. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" resounded through the clouds. For a long time after Chairman Mao left Changchun Film Studio, people still lingered in the courtyard, happily and excitedly talking about it. Obviously, everyone was intoxicated by this happy meeting.

The meeting with Chairman Mao was cherished by the comrades as the most unforgettable moment of their lives, the most memorable great joy, and also the greatest glory and inspiration in filming "Flame Colt." On this day, the comrades of the "Flame Colt" group worked enthusiastically for thirteen hours, and no one felt tired. Everyone felt that they had suddenly gained an unparalleled strength, and the source of this strength was the meeting with Chairman Mao.

    最大的光荣和鼓舞
    毛主席在长春会见秦腔演员
    李哲明
    2月14日，在长春电影制片厂的四周，虽然积雪还是白茫茫的一片，但是寒冬似乎已经悄悄地逝去了。来自西北地区的秦腔电影剧团的同志们，怀着欢欣的心情迎接了这个早春。
    中午，将近十二时，“火焰驹”的演员萧玉玲、李应真、萧若兰等正在录音室录音，在检听室的旁门突然出现了一位客人。这位客人身穿灰色大衣，精神奕奕，态度安详而和蔼，在亚马厂长陪同下，徐徐走进室内。在那一霎间，大家被这突如其来的贵宾降临而愕住了。演员忘却了歌唱，乐队忘却了伴奏，大家出神地凝视着这位既面熟而又从未见过面的客人。半晌，大家好像如梦初醒似的，异口同声地叫喊着“毛主席！”同志们热烈地鼓掌欢迎起来。这时毛主席频频举手示谢，并走进实录室和同志们一一握手。当毛主席听到厂长介绍说这是由陕西来拍秦腔“火焰驹”的演员和工作人员时，他非常高兴地对演员说：“噢！你们是由陕西来拍秦腔电影的，很好。”可以看出，毛主席对陕西是多么关怀和亲切啊！
    谁能想到会在这里遇见毛主席呢？但是，这是千真万确的，现在他正和大家面对面立着说话。在他离开录音室前，还和演员们合影留念。这时秦腔电影剧团乐队有一个音乐员，他已几乎完全失去了视力，只有当他的眼睛紧紧挨近事物的面前时，才能隐隐约约看到一丝微光，事实上等于一个盲人。他听说毛主席来啦，简直急的不得了，他想看看毛主席的面容。他挤到毛主席的身边，虽然没有看到，但是他却看到了毛主席的大衣，他高兴得不得了，逢人就说，他眼睛没有瞎，他见到了毛主席了。拉二弦的王老和吹号的史老感动得流下了眼泪。他们说：“没有他老人家，咋能过今天这样的好日子。”很多青年同志更是喜欢得跳起来。
    当毛主席走到录音室门外时，院子里已被长影的同志们围得水泄不通，一片欢呼声：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”欢呼声响彻云霄。在毛主席离开长影后的好长时间里，人们还逗留在院子里欢乐而兴奋地谈论着，显然大家已陶醉在这幸福的会见中了。
    和毛主席的会见，同志们珍视为一生中最难忘的时刻，最值得纪念的大喜事，也是拍摄“火焰驹”中最大的光荣和鼓舞。这一天，“火焰驹”组的同志们兴奋地工作了十三小时，谁也没有感到疲乏。大家都觉得自己突然增加了一股无比的力量，这力量的源泉，就是与毛主席的会见。
