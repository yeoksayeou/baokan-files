    Orient National Education Towards Production
    Over Two Thousand Secondary Schools in the Russian Federation Restructured
    Schools in Democratic Germany Prepare to Strengthen Technical Education
    (Report from our correspondent in Moscow, April 28th) In the Soviet Union's Russian Federal Republic, 2,500 secondary schools have already adopted new teaching syllabuses, and this number will double from next semester. This was mentioned by Naumov, Director of the Secondary School Administration Department of the Ministry of Education of the Russian Federal Republic, in a recent conversation with reporters. Naumov also said that the characteristic of this new teaching syllabus is to orient national education towards production, strengthen labor education and technical education for students, so that all secondary school graduates not only possess the necessary knowledge of industrial and agricultural production, but also can immediately participate in industrial and agricultural production labor after graduation.
    The new teaching syllabus stipulates strengthening "Labor Class" from the first to seventh grades, and from the fifth to seventh grades, there should be two hours per week of labor practice in the school's workshops and production gardens. From the eighth to tenth grades, the course of "Basic Knowledge of Industrial and Agricultural Production" and related internships and visits will be added. The teaching of basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production is closely related to general courses. Such a new teaching syllabus changes the shortcomings of schools being divorced from life in the past, improves the speed and depth of students' knowledge acquisition, corrects some students' incorrect views on labor, and arouses students' general interest in life and science.
    In order to enable students to specifically understand the production process of factories, urban schools, in addition to organizing visits, also stipulate a one-month factory internship period every year starting from the eighth grade. Because many students have already mastered preliminary operating techniques at school, they can quickly obtain worker grades with the help of workers and become lathe operators and milling operators. Rural schools pay special attention to teaching agricultural production knowledge and agricultural technology, and students' internships are in agricultural cooperatives. In some places, student work teams are also established during the busy farming season. Urban schools also have one month of internship in rural areas after the ninth grade.
    After the implementation of the new teaching syllabus, various amateur groups have been widely established in various schools, such as "Automobile Group," "Radio Group," "Biology Group," etc. Many female students in schools have also formed "Sewing Group" and "Household Affairs Group."
    The implementation of the new teaching syllabus has proved that it has many advantages. Now, various education departments and scientific research institutions are summarizing preliminary experiences and preparing to further promote it throughout the country.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 28th According to a report by the German News Agency on the 26th, the school work conference convened by the German Socialist Unity Party closed on the 25th. During the two-day conference, the representatives had a heated discussion on the fundamental reform to be implemented in Democratic German schools aimed at closely integrating book knowledge with production practice, and unanimously passed a corresponding resolution.
    Lange, Minister of Education of Democratic Germany and Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, made a speech on comprehensive technical education at the meeting. He emphasized that "Comprehensive technical education is the core of socialist schools." He said that building socialism is the purpose of school education. The central issue is "to fill the hearts and minds of our young men and women with great visions for the future and to inspire them to dedicate themselves to the cause of socialism."
    Lange then put forward a five-point plan for the implementation of comprehensive technical education: systematically implement comprehensive technical education in schools and teachers' colleges; combine the current labor classes and drawing classes in primary and secondary schools into a new course called "Basic Principles of Socialist Production," which will be taught starting from the next academic year; elementary school students should start to become familiar with production labor from the age of ten, and students over the age of thirteen should have one labor day per week on their curriculum; all other courses must truly cooperate with the tasks of comprehensive technical education; and establish a "Comprehensive Technical Museum" for the general public to visit. When talking about the training of teachers in the future, Lange emphasized that teacher training must also be closely integrated with production labor.

    使国民教育面向生产
    俄罗斯联邦两千多中学改制
    民主德国学校准备加强技术教育
    本报莫斯科28日电　苏联俄罗斯联邦共和国已有二千五百个中等学校采用了新的教学大纲，从下学期起这样的学校还要增加一倍。这是俄罗斯联邦共和国教育部中学管理司司长纳乌莫夫最近在同记者谈话中提到的。纳乌莫夫还说，这个新教学大纲的特点就是使国民教育面向生产，加强对学生的劳动教育和技术教育，使所有的中学毕业生不但能具备必要的工农业生产知识，并且能够在毕业后马上参加工农业生产劳动。
    新教学大纲规定从一年级到七年级加强“劳动课”，同时从五年级到七年级每周要有两小时在学校劳作室和生产园地上进行劳动实习。从八年级到十年级增加“工农业生产基本知识”的课程以及与课程相配合的实习和参观。工农业生产基本知识的讲授是与一般课程有密切联系的。这样一个新的教学大纲改变了从前学校脱离生活的缺点，提高了学生掌握知识的速度与深度，端正了某些学生对劳动的不正确看法，并且引起了学生对生活和科学的普遍兴趣。
    为了使学生具体了解工厂的生产过程，城市中的学校除组织参观外并规定从八年级起每年有一个月的工厂实习期间。许多学生因为在学校已经掌握了初步的操作技术，所以在工人的帮助下能够很快取得工级，成为车工、旋工。在农村的学校特别注意讲授农业生产知识与农业技术，学生们的实习就在农庄，有的地方在农忙时期还成立学生工作队，城市的学校在九年级以后也有一个月的时间到农村实习。
    新教学大纲实行后，各个学校普遍建立各种业余小组，例如“汽车小组”、“无线电小组”、“生物小组”等，许多学校的女学生还组成了“缝纫小组”和“家事小组”。
    新教学大纲实行的情况证明，它的好处是很多的，现在各教育部门和科学研究机构正在总结初步经验，准备进一步推广到全国各地。
    新华社28日讯　据德意志通讯社26日报道，德国统一社会党召开的学校工作会议已经在25日闭幕。在两天的会议过程中，代表们就即将在民主德国学校中实施的旨在使书本知识与生产实践密切结合的根本性改革进行了热烈讨论，并且一致通过了一项相应的决议。
    民主德国教育部长、德国统一社会党中央委员会候补委员兰格在会上作了有关综合技术教育的发言。他着重指出，“综合技术教育是社会主义学校的核心。”他说，建设社会主义是学校教育的目的。中心问题在于“要使我国男女青少年的心灵和脑海中充满对未来的伟大憧憬，并且鼓舞他们献身于社会主义事业。”
    兰格接着提出了一项有关实施综合技术教育的五点计划：在学校和师范学院中有计划地实施综合技术教育；把目前初级和中级学校里的劳作课同图画课相结合变成一门名叫“社会主义生产基础”的新课，从下一学年开始讲授；小学生从十岁起应开始熟悉生产劳动，而十三岁以上的学生每周课程表上应有一天劳动日；一切其他课程都要真正同综合技术教育的任务相配合；建立一个“综合技术博物馆”供广大群众参观。在谈到今后师资培养问题时，兰格强调说，师资训练也必须同生产劳动密切相结合。
