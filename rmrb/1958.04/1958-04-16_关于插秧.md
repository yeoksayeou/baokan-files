    On Rice Transplanting
    The general process of rice cultivation is first seedling cultivation, then transplanting. The specially processed and leveled field for cultivating seedlings is called a seedbed. Spreading the rice seeds in the seedbed is called sowing. After the seedlings grow, they are pulled out and transplanted in clusters into ordinary paddy fields, which is called transplanting, or "planting" in some areas.
    In the March 18th issue of your newspaper, on the fourth page, in the "In Newspapers Across the Country" column, the last paragraph, "Protecting seedlings is like raising infants," clearly refers to the seedbed, but the text says, "For the already transplanted seedlings, there is an urgent need for good protection." How could there be so many shelters for paddy fields across the country!
    Also, in the March 21st issue, on the fourth page, in the article "After Decentralization," in the section "Humbly Learning Technology," it begins by saying, "The planted young seedlings..." seeming to refer to seedlings already transplanted into the fields, but then Ding Daocai says, "The water in the seedbed is too deep..." clearly referring to the seedbed. However, the illustration shows a planted paddy field. According to the season, Huangpi, Hubei, is not yet in the rice transplanting season.
    These reports, when seen by real farmers, are not only laughable but also fail to serve the purpose of spreading experience. I hope that the interviewing and editing comrades will pay attention to this in the future.　Reader Zhang Yishan

### 关于插秧

    关于插秧
    水稻种植一般过程是先育苗后插秧。加工平整专供培育秧苗的田叫秧田，谷种撒在秧田里叫播种。秧苗长成后，拔出来再一丛丛插在普通水田里这叫插秧，有些地区叫“栽”。
    你报3月18日第四版“在各地报纸上”一栏最后一段“护秧如育婴”所讲护秧棚，分明是指秧田，而文内却说“对于已插的秧苗，急需好好保护”。全国多少稻田，那来这么多棚子！
    又3月21日第四版“下放以后”文中“虚心学习技术”一段，开头讲“栽下的幼小秧苗……”好像指已经分插到田里的秧苗，而中间丁道才说“秧田水太深……”，分明又指秧田。但插图所画又是插好的稻田。据时令，湖北黄陂也还不到插秧季节。
    这些报道叫真正种田人看来，不但是笑话，而且也起不到传播经验的作用。希望采访和编辑同志今后注意。　读者张易山
