Establishing Production Bases for Wild Plants
Jiangxi Sends 3,000 Cadres into the Mountains

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 21st dispatch) Relevant departments in Jiangxi Province are taking measures to strive to establish nearly a thousand factories and workshops utilizing wild plant materials this year.

In order to utilize wild plant materials in large quantities, relevant departments in Jiangxi recently dispatched working groups to go deep into the mountainous areas to investigate the types and resources of wild plants. Subsequently, based on the information obtained, they dispatched more than 3,000 cadres to the mountainous areas to establish production bases for wild plants. Among the factories and workshops to be established this year, there are 40 factories that extract various industrial and edible oils from hawthorn seeds, camphor trees, etc., and they will produce 70,000 dan of oils and fats this year. This year, it is planned to produce 300 to 400 million jin of fiber and starch from acorns and Imperata cylindrica. At present, relevant departments and leading organs in various counties have taken measures to promote the realization of this plan. Six special districts and many counties in the province have held training classes, technical exchange meetings, and traveling exhibitions on the utilization of wild plants, using specimens and other physical objects to introduce to people the growing areas, shapes, and cultivation and harvesting methods of various wild plants. Relevant departments in the Gannan District have also helped the people in the mountainous areas to propagate more than 500,000 plants of 12 kinds of wild plants such as mountain Litsea cubeba and snow flake bark. Various places have also trial-produced a large number of labor-saving and efficient wild plant harvesting tools for the mountainous areas. (Li Yuqing, Liu Guanghui)

    建立野生植物的生产基地
    江西三千干部进山
    本报南昌21日电　江西省有关部门正采取措施，争取今年内建立近千个利用野生植物原料的工厂和作坊。
    江西各地有关部门为了大量利用野生植物原料，不久前曾派出工作组，深入山区调查野生植物的种类、资源等情况，接着，根据所了解的情况又派出了三千多名干部前往山区建立野生植物的生产基地。在今年建立的工厂和作坊中，用山楂子、樟树等提炼多种工业用油和食用油的工厂就有四十个，今年内就将生产出七万担油脂油料。今年计划用橡子、龙须草制作的纤维、淀粉有三、四亿斤。目前，各有关部门和各县领导机关已采取措施来促进这个计划的实现。全省六个专区和许多县都举办了利用野生植物的训练班、技术交流会和巡回展览会，拿出标本等实物向人们介绍各种野生植物的生长地区、形状和栽培、采摘方法。赣南区有关部门还帮助山区人民繁殖了五十多万株山苍籽、雪花皮等十二种野生植物。各地还为山区试制成了大批既省力效率又高的野生植物采摘工具。　（李余庆、刘光辉）
