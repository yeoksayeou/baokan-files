Xinhua News Agency, Gaomi, 25th. Over 4,000 people from all walks of life in Gaomi County held a grand meeting today to welcome and console compatriot Liu Lianren.

Liu Xiaochu, a representative of the Zhucheng County People's Committee, Du Guixiang, Dan Fengchi, and Wang Jiaxiang, who were abducted to Japan along with Liu Lianren, and Liu Guifa, a family member of a victim, came from over a hundred miles away to participate in the meeting, entrusted by the people of Zhucheng County.

Zhang Hongda, the head of Gaomi County, first expressed warm concern and condolences to Liu Lianren on behalf of the County People's Committee. He said that Japanese fascists had left irreparable wounds on Liu Lianren's body and spirit, and we firmly demand that the Nobusuke Kishi government provide compensation. The Liu Lianren incident tells us that we have the right to question the Japanese government: How many more Liu Lianrens are still suffering? The Japanese government must provide a concrete explanation and cannot escape this responsibility.

Liu Lianren spoke to the elders and brothers three times at today's meeting. He accused Japanese imperialism of the various tortures he suffered and resolutely demanded that the Nobusuke Kishi government compensate him for all his losses. His fellow sufferers Chen Zongfu, Chen Guoqi, Du Guixiang, Deng Zhuanyou, Zhang Tongsheng and others also recounted the detailed circumstances after they separated from him in Japan. Their accusations, filled with tears, evoked painful memories in many people who had suffered from Japanese militarism. The welcoming meeting turned into an accusation meeting.

Representatives from the Gaomi County Political Consultative Committee and the Women's Federation also spoke at the meeting, expressing sympathy for the accusations made by Liu Lianren and other victims, and firmly supporting the legitimate demands made by Liu Lianren and others on the Japanese government. They pointed out that although Liu Lianren has returned, the Liu Lianren incident is not over.

Finally, representatives from all walks of life in Gaomi County presented Liu Lianren with gifts such as bedding, sheets, and pillows at the meeting. (Attached photo)

When Liu Lianren returned to Gaomi County from Jinan on April 23, he met with his fellow sufferers Chen Zongfu (first from the left), Deng Zhuanyou (second from the left), and Chen Guoqi, who had come from afar to welcome him. Thirteen years ago, they escaped from the Showa Coal Mine in Japan into the mountains of Hokkaido with Liu Lianren. Today, they were reunited, filled with mixed emotions of sorrow and joy.

    高密县四千多人举行大会慰问刘连仁
    据新华社高密25日电　高密县各界人民四千多人，今天举行盛大集会欢迎和慰问难胞刘连仁。
    诸城县人民委员会的代表刘晓初、和刘连仁一起被掳去日本的杜桂相、单凤池、王家祥和被难家属刘桂法等受诸城县人民的委托，从百里外赶来参加了这次大会。
    高密县县长张洪达首先代表县人民委员会向刘连仁表示热情的关怀和慰问，他说日本法西斯在刘连仁身上和精神上留下了不可补救的创伤，我们坚决要岸信介政府进行赔偿；刘连仁事件告诉我们，我们有权向日本政府提出质问：到底还有多少个刘连仁现在仍然在受着折磨？日本政府必须作出具体的交代，想逃避这个责任是不行的。
    刘连仁在今天的大会上向父老兄弟们讲了三次话。他控诉了日本帝国主义对他的种种折磨，并且坚决要求岸信介政府赔偿他的一切损失。他的难友陈宗福、陈国起、杜桂相、邓撰友、张同升等也讲述了在日本同他分手后的详细经过。他们一字一泪的控诉引起了全场许多身受日本军国主义迫害的人们的沉痛回忆。欢迎大会变成了控诉大会。
    高密县政协委员会、妇联等单位的代表也都在会上讲了话，他们对刘连仁等难胞的控诉表示同情，并且坚决支持刘连仁等对日本政府提出的正当要求。他们指出，刘连仁虽然回来了，但刘连仁事件并没有结束。

    刘连仁4月23日从济南回到高密县的时候，会见了特地从远道来迎接他的难友陈宗福（左一）、邓撰友（左二）和陈国起。他们十三年前和刘连仁一起从日本昭和煤矿逃进北海道深山，今天重逢，悲喜交集。
