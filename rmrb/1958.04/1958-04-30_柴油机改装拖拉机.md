    Diesel Engine Modified Tractor
    A small tractor modified with a five-horsepower diesel engine is being tested and promoted in rural areas of Jieyu County, Shanxi Province. It has been proven to be effective after appraisal.

    This small tractor is light and flexible. It can plow two mu of land per hour with a double-furrow plow; it can travel thirty li per hour carrying more than 2,100 jin of fertilizer.

    The Jieyu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that this is an advanced method to improve machine utilization and accelerate the realization of rural mechanization. In mid-April, at the county's local industry leap forward conference, more than 700 representatives were organized to visit, learn, and exchange experiences for promotion. It was decided to modify all 300 existing diesel engines. After this plan is realized, not only can transportation be semi-mechanized, but more than 162,000 animal power units can also be saved.

    柴油机改装拖拉机
    一种用五马力柴油机改装成的小型拖拉机，正在山西省解虞县农村试用推广，经过鉴定证明效果良好。
    这种小型拖拉机轻便灵活，拖着双铧犁每小时可耕地二亩；载着二千一百多斤肥料，每小时可行驶三十里。
    中共解虞县委会认为这是提高机器利用率加速实现农村机械化的先进办法。4月中旬在全县地方工业跃进会议上，组织七百多名代表进行了参观学习和交流推广，决定把现有的三百部柴油机全部改装。这一计划实现后，不仅交通运输可以实行半机械化，同时可节省畜力十六万二千多个。　（据新华社讯）
