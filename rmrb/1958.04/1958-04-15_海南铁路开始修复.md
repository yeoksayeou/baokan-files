Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 14th: The Hainan Railway, which has been out of service for twelve years, will begin to be restored within the year. The southern section of this railway—the line from Huangliu City to Yulin Port—will be completed and open to traffic next year. At present, its preparatory work and design work have already begun. The restoration project of the northern section of the line will also begin after the southern section is restored.

This railway is located in the southwest of Hainan Island, starting from Shilu Ridge and ending at Yulin Port, with a total length of more than 200 kilometers. This railway was originally built by Japanese imperialism in 1943 to plunder the rich resources of Hainan Island. The engineering was simple and crude, and the transportation capacity was very low. It was destroyed by a typhoon in 1946 and has not been in operation since.

In recent years, the construction undertakings in the Hainan area have developed rapidly. The Yinggehai Saltworks, which produces one million tons of sea salt annually, is being built near Huangliu City; the Yazhou Sugar Factory and the Jiusuo Sugar Factory, which produce 200,000 tons of sugar annually, are also being built along the Hainan Railway line. The restoration of the Hainan Railway is of great significance for solving the transportation problems of the products of these factories and mines.

    海南铁路开始修复
    新华社广州14日电  停运十二年的海南铁路，将在年内开始修复。这条铁路的南段——从黄流市到榆林港的线路，将在明年修成通车。现在，它的筹建和设计工作已经开始了。北段线路的修复工程在南段线路修复后也将开始。
    这条铁路位于海南岛西南部，从石碌岭起到榆林港止，全长二百多公里。这条铁路原是日本帝国主义入侵时为掠夺海南岛的富源，在1943年修成的，工程简陋粗糙，运输能力很低。1946年被台风毁后，一直到现在没有通车。
    近年来，海南地区建设事业迅速发展。年产百万吨海盐的莺歌海盐场正在黄流市附近兴建；年产糖二十万吨的崖城糖厂、九所糖厂也在海南铁路沿线兴建。修复海南铁路，对于解决这些厂矿企业产品运输问题，有着很大意义。
