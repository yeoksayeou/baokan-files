    Deep into Factories and Farms, Convenient for the Audience
    Major Transformation in the Working Style of Beijing Theaters and Theatrical Troupes
    (Our report) The "Double-Anti" movement has blossomed and borne fruit in many art performance groups and theaters/cinemas in Beijing, and a new style of "going deep into factories and farms, making it convenient for the audience" has replaced the past bureaucratic, stagnant, and pampered ways.
    Looking at the performance schedules of many state-run art performance groups in Beijing over the past two months, the time spent going to the countryside and factories, and delivering performances to the doorstep accounts for a large proportion. Many theaters (troupes) sent touring performance teams to industrial and mining rural areas in Hebei and Shanxi around the Spring Festival, while also bringing plays to some factories, agricultural cooperatives, military garrisons, and workers' communities in the suburbs and urban areas of Beijing. In this way, the large-scale opera "Huaiyin Ji," which could only be performed in large theaters in the past, was brought to remote high mountains; tricycle workers saw "Rickshaw Boy" performed by famous actors in the small theaters they often visit; famous soloists and instrumentalists also left the theaters and came to the Workers' Cultural Palace to sing popular songs and play light music; many new plays and current affairs dramas reflecting the current production and construction and political life were successively written, and cadres going to lower levels, the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, and new people and new events in the Great Leap Forward met the audience on the stage in a timely manner.
    For many large-scale art performance groups in Beijing who used to cling to the theaters, the popularization activities of the past two months can be said to have created a new situation of "sending charcoal in the snow," which has been rarely seen in recent years. It has brought ideological and artistic harvests to the artists, and greatly encouraged the production and work enthusiasm of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The worker-peasant audiences affectionately call the touring performance teams "Central Comfort Teams" and "relatives sent by Chairman Mao." They completed double the work beforehand, which might have been delayed by watching the performance. They then used amazing production achievements to thank the artists. Countless similar moving facts are inspiring everyone in the touring performance teams. In the past, the actors of the Central Experimental Opera House, who were full of preciousness and extravagance, traveled 250 miles in fifteen days, climbed over eleven mountains, participated in physical labor, and performed seventeen shows when they went to the hard-living Fuping mountainous area this time. Moreover, they set up their own stages and cooked their own meals, and everyone was in high spirits, with no one complaining. The actors of the China Pingju Theater, the China Acrobatic Troupe, and the Central Song and Dance Troupe braved the cold of minus thirty degrees Celsius for the first time to perform for the farmers. Tens of thousands of viewers watched the performances for five or six hours in a row while wrapped in cotton quilts, and the actors gradually forgot the cold. The day after the China Youth Art Theater performed in the Datong Tongjialiang mining area, the labor heroes reported their joy to the actors by creating a new record of ten meters of rock bottom. The actors, who were moved, arranged the workers' drive into a short play overnight and performed it the next morning.
    The large number of pennants and thank-you letters presented by the worker-peasant-soldier audiences are encouraging the artists to create more and better plays and to perform for the workers, peasants, and soldiers in various ways. At present, many art performance groups in Beijing have formulated plans for touring performances in factories and rural areas this year and are rushing to rehearse new programs. The Central Experimental Opera House has decided to send four teams to the Northeast, Southwest, East China, and Northwest regions for touring performances starting in May, of which more than one-third of the performances will be delivered directly to the doorsteps of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    What the audience praised in the theater work was the door-to-door ticket delivery, the basic elimination of queuing to buy tickets, and the improvement of the service attitude of the service staff. At present, in addition to setting up street ticket sales stations and using mobile ticket sales vehicles and telephone ticket sales methods to deliver tickets to the door, many theaters and cinemas in Beijing also send ticket sellers to hotels, bathhouses, hotels, and even buses to sell tickets, in order to facilitate the audience in every possible way. Many theaters and cinemas have broken old rules and handled ticket refunds for the audience, which has brought the audience closer to the theaters. Many viewers have already made friends with the ticket sellers.
    "Entering the theater is like being at home," is the comment of many viewers on the theater work. In the "Daily Bulletin of the Great Leap Forward in the Work of Beijing Theaters," moving deeds of service staff enthusiastically serving the audience and thank-you letters from the audience are published almost every day. Here is just one "small thing" as an example: A mother took her child to the Dahua Cinema to watch a movie. The child suddenly became noisy, so the service staff took the child out and coaxed her, so that the mother could watch the movie with peace of mind. The teachers of Rongxian Hutong Elementary School were very busy because of the Double-Anti Movement and did not have time to send the lower grade students to the cinema to watch a movie. When the Central Cinema learned about this situation, they sent someone to the school to lead the lower grade students to the cinema to watch the movie and safely escorted them back to school. The audience said in a letter of praise that only with a great leap forward in thinking and truly serving the audience wholeheartedly will such things happen.

### 深入工农　便利观众  北京剧团、剧场工作作风大转变

    深入工农　便利观众
    北京剧团、剧场工作作风大转变
    本报讯　双反运动在北京许多艺术表演团体和剧院、电影院中开花结果，“深入工农，便利观众”的新作风已经代替了过去的官风、暮气和娇气。
    从近两个月北京许多国营艺术表演团体的演出日程表上看，下乡下厂、送戏上门的时间占了很大比重。许多剧院（团）在春节前后都派巡回演出队到河北、山西的工矿农村去，同时又把戏送到北京市郊和市内的一些工厂、农业社、部队驻地和工人聚居区。这样，从前只能在大剧场演出的大型歌剧“槐荫记”就上了偏僻的高山；三轮车工人在他们常去的小剧场里看到了名角演出的“骆驼祥子”；著名的独唱家和演奏家也离开剧院来到劳动人民文化宫唱群众歌曲和奏轻音乐；许多反映当前生产建设和政治生活的新戏、时事剧陆续写出来，干部下放、修十三陵水库和大跃进中的新人新事及时在舞台上同观众见了面。
    对于过去常常抱住剧场不放的北京许多大型艺术表演团体来说，这两个月来的普及活动可以说是创造了一个几年来少见的“雪里送炭”的新局面，它已经给艺术家们带来了思想上、艺术上的丰收，并且大大鼓舞了工农兵观众的生产和工作热情。工农观众亲切地把巡回演出队称做“中央慰问团”和“毛主席派来的亲人”，他们早在看戏以前就用双倍的劳动完成了因为看戏可能耽误的生产任务，在看戏以后又用惊人的生产成绩来答谢艺术家们，类似的无数动人事实都在激励着巡回演出队的每一个人。过去娇气、阔气俱全的中央实验歌剧院的演员们这次到生活艰苦的阜平山区演出时，十五天走了二百五十里，翻过十一座大山，参加了体力劳动，还演出了十七场，而且自己装台、作饭，大家都情绪饱满，没有一个人叫苦。中国评剧院、中国杂技团、中央歌舞团下乡巡回演出的演员们第一次冒着零下三十多度的寒风为农民献艺，上万的观众披着棉被坐在地上连看五六小时，演员们渐渐也就忘记了冷。中国青年艺术剧院在大同同家梁矿区演出的第二天，劳动英雄们就以创造起石底十公尺的新纪录来向演员报喜，被激动了的演员们连夜把工人这种干劲编排成短剧，第二天早晨就演出了。
    工农兵观众赠送的大批锦旗和感谢信，都在鼓舞着艺术家们编排更多更好的戏，并且用各种方式多为工农兵演出。目前北京许多艺术表演团体都制定了今年深入工厂农村巡回演出的计划，并且正在赶排新节目。中央实验歌剧院决定从5月份起派四个队到东北、西南、华东、西北等地巡回演出，其中有三分之一以上的场次将直接给工农兵观众送上门去。
    在剧场工作中使广大观众赞不绝口的是送票上门、基本上消灭买票排队现象和服务员服务态度的改善。目前，北京许多剧院、电影院除设立街头售票站和采用流动售票车、电话售票等办法送票上门以外，还派售票员深入饭店、澡堂、旅馆甚至到公共汽车上售票，来千方百计地便利观众。很多剧场、影院打破陋规，为观众办理退票手续，这些都使观众同剧场更加接近了，不少观众已经同售票员交成了好朋友。
      “入场如同在家”，这是不少观众对剧场工作的评语。在“北京各剧场工作大跃进日刊”上，差不多每天都登载服务员热心为观众服务的动人事迹和观众的感谢信。这里只举一件“小事”作例子：一位母亲抱着孩子到大华电影院看电影，孩子突然闹起来，服务员就把孩子抱出去并且替她哄好，使这位母亲安心地看完了电影。绒线胡同小学的教师因为双反运动很忙，没有时间送低年级学生到影院看电影，中央电影院知道这个情况，就派人到学校带领低年级学生来院看了电影，并且安全护送回校。观众在表扬信中说，只有思想大跃进，真正做到全心全意为观众服务，才会出现这种事情。
