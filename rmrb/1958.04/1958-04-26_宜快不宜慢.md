    Better Fast Than Slow
    Ruan Yanshun

    A friend, after reading my article "The Sea Cannot Be Measured with a Pint," said to me that those who use "doing future things now" to mock our overestimation of our abilities should certainly be criticized. However, he believes that "doing future things now" is still possible, and is a good thing, asking me back, "Why don't you dare to admit that it's a good thing?"

    Actually, the crux of the matter does not lie in whether this matter is good or bad, but whether it conforms to objective reality. If it is objectively existent, even if it is a bad thing, it must be admitted. Denying objectively existent things is always incompatible with the style of communists.

    I still believe that the possibility of "doing future things now" does not actually exist, even though people often say: so-and-so advanced producer is already ahead of time. In our country, doing more and faster than the original plan, running ahead of the original planned time, is very common and very widespread. This is because communists understand materialist dialectics. The proposal of planned tasks is always premised on the objective possibilities that have already been recognized; and it also admits that things are always developing non-stop, and people's understanding of them always develops along with their development, but is always slightly behind it. Then, things are often like this: our new understanding yesterday may be slightly insufficient today, and some possibilities that were not recognized yesterday may be recognized today. People can use actions to turn existing possibilities into reality based on their new understanding, but they cannot create things whose possibilities do not yet exist today. Moreover, no matter how smart people are, it is difficult to achieve no omissions in their understanding of today's things. It can be seen that people cannot even finish today's things, how can they do tomorrow's things?

    Precisely because of this, communists are never limited by their original understanding, and are never restricted by original conventions in their actions, but dare to break through original conventions, constantly liberate themselves, and move forward with big strides. Such heroic spirit and noble style are precisely what those who stick to conventions cannot understand.

    Therefore, the debate on "doing future things now" has important ideological significance. But the problem is not limited to the ideological aspect. In fact, it is also a question of the speed of socialist construction.

    Logically speaking, in the issue of construction speed, both acute and chronic diseases can occur. But in reality, acute diseases are always easier to see and therefore easier to prevent and treat. Chronic diseases are not so obvious. The relations of production often lagging behind the development of the productive forces is originally an objective law, and chronic diseases precisely reflect this situation. In addition, chronic disease sufferers who are pacing along the road of construction often pretend to be steady, making it even more difficult for people to see at a glance.

    The "critics" who mock us are precisely some chronic disease sufferers. They use their cold hands to touch us, and then describe our normal body temperature as a high fever, shouting and yelling for us to stay in bed and rest. Even if we admit that this comes from good intentions, should we therefore flinch?

    The source of these chronic disease sufferers' illness is probably due to mental depression and weak appetite. For example, they always feel that our China is too poor, our culture and technology are too backward, and our population is too large, just like those poor people with many children in the old society, always feeling overwhelmed by the burden of life. Over time, this heavy burden has flattened their spiritual world, forming a style of being short of ambition when poor, and they no longer dare to stand up straight, fearing that they cannot afford to bear any mishaps. Therefore, these people always act timidly when encountering things.

    In fact, as long as they open their eyes a little, they will not find it difficult to see how good and abundant the conditions our country has. Large land, abundant resources, and a large and capable population are our unique advantages. This means that we have both heroes and a place to use them. Although our original cultural and technical level is low, we are hardworking and creative, and we can also fully utilize the construction experience of the Soviet Union and receive the unreserved assistance of fraternal countries in the socialist camp. We have a highly Marxist-Leninist party and a good tradition of the mass line. Every widespread and profound mass movement will produce unexpected miracles. The encirclement and suppression of sparrows is like this, the water conservancy movement of moving mountains and overturning seas is like this, and so is the entire socialist construction. Even the small peasants who have been liberated from thousands of years of feudal oppression, once united, "dare to compete with the heavens," and "will harvest whether it is drought or flood," let alone the working class armed with advanced technology. Then, what are the supposedly clever "critics" worrying about?

    If our ancestors have already told us a maxim for grasping the opportunity, "Better early than late," then "Better fast than slow" should become the code of conduct for every Chinese during the period of socialist construction.

    Needless to say, we communists naturally respect objective conditions very much.

    宜快不宜慢
    阮延顺
    一个朋友读了我写的“海水不可斗量”以后对我说，那些用“现在办将来的事”来嘲笑我们不自量力的人，当然应该批评；但是，他认为“现在办将来的事”也还是可能的，而且是好事，反问我“好事为什么也不敢承认呢？”
    其实，问题的关键倒不在这事是好还是坏，而在它是不是符合于客观实际。如果是客观存在的，即使是一件坏事，也必须承认，否认客观存在的事，是永远同共产党人的风格不相称的。
    我仍然认为“现在办将来的事”的可能在实际上并不存在，尽管有时人们也常说：某某先进生产者，已经跑在了时间的前边。在我们的国家里，比原有计划做得更多更快，跑到原有计划时间前边的事，是很经常又很普遍的。这是因为共产党人懂得唯物辩证法。计划任务的提出，总是以已经认识了的客观可能性为前提；而又承认事物总是在不停的发展，人对它的认识又总是随着它们发展而发展，但又稍稍落后于它的一步。那末，事情便经常是这样：我们昨天的新认识，到今天便可能稍嫌不足，而昨天还没有认识到的一些可能性，到今天又会被认识。人是可以依据自己新的认识，用行动把已存在的可能性变为现实的，却无法把今天还不存在它的可能的东西创造出来。还有，尽管人是如何的聪明，对今天事物的认识，也难作到不漏万一。可见，人们连今天的事也办不完，哪里还能办得出明天的事来？
    正是因为这样，共产党人从来都不受原有认识的局限，在行动上也从来不被原有的成规所限死，而是敢于突破原有的成规，时时解放自己，大踏步前进。这样一种英雄气魄和高尚风格，正是那些墨守成规的人所无法理解的。
    所以，关于“现在办将来的事”的争论，是具有思想上的重要意义的。但问题还不仅仅限于思想方面，实际上它又是关于社会主义建设速度上的问题。
    按道理讲，在建设速度问题上，是既可以出现急性病，也可以出现慢性病的。但在实际上急性病总是比较容易看出来，也就容易防治。而慢性病就不那么显露。生产关系经常落后于生产力的发展，本来就是一种客观规律，而慢性病恰恰就是经常反映的这种状况，再加上踱步在建设道路上的慢性病患者，又常常装出一付稳健的样子，就更难使人一眼看出了。
    嘲笑我们的“批评家”们，正是一些慢性病患者。他们用自己冰凉的手来摸我们，便把本来正常的体温，说成是发高烧，大嚷小叫的非叫我们卧床静养不可。即使承认这是出自一种好意吧，难道我们就应因此却步？
    这些慢性病患者的病源，大概是由于精神抑郁，胃口过弱造成的。例如，他们老觉得我们中国太穷，文化和技术太落后，人口又太多，好像旧社会里那些多子女的穷汉一样，老觉得被生活的重担压得喘不过气来。久之，这种沉重的负担，把他们的精神世界都压扁了，形成了一种人穷志短的风格，再也不敢挺起腰来，生怕有些什么闪失而承受不起。因此，这些人遇到事，总是缩手缩脚的。
    其实，只要他们打开一些眼界，便不难看到我们国家里具有多么良好的多和快的条件。地大、物博，人多而能干，是我们得天独厚。这是既有了英雄，又有了用武之地。我们原有文化、技术水平虽低，但我们勤劳刻苦，善于创造，我们更能充分利用苏联的建设经验，得到社会主义阵营兄弟国家的豪不吝啬的援助。我们有一个高度马克思列宁主义的党，又有良好的群众路线的传统。每一个广泛的深刻的群众运动，都会出现人们意料不到的奇迹。围剿麻雀的事是这样，移山倒海的水利运动是这样，整个的社会主义建设又何尝不是这样？就连从几千年封建压迫下解放出来的小农，一旦结合起来，也“敢与天公试比高”，“旱也要收，涝也要收”，何况用先进技术武装的工人阶级。那末，自以为聪明的“批评家”，倒底是耽的什么忧呢？
    如果说，我们的先人已经告诉了我们一条掌握时机的格言“宜早不宜迟”，那末，“宜快不宜慢”，便应该成为社会主义建设时期每一个中国人的行动守则。
    不用说，我们共产党人自然是十分尊重客观条件的。
