    Breaking Another Convention
    Zhī Píng
    Every day the newspapers bring a wealth of exciting news. Everywhere is breaking conventions and leaping forward with the force of a surging wave and the power of a thunderbolt. The way of conservatism is waning, and the way of revolution is flourishing. People feel that in this great leap forward, anyone who relaxes even slightly will be left far behind. But some people are so frightened by this intense situation that they are panic-stricken and at a loss. They feel that the movements are coming one after another, too intense, and they cannot sit down to read or engage in professional work, so they are distressed.
    Why do people living in the same era and the same environment have such different thoughts and feelings? Leaving aside other factors, simply from the perspective of thinking methods, this is the difference between revolutionary dialectics and conservative metaphysics. From the metaphysical point of view, everything in the world has always been as it is and will not change. As the saying goes, "Heaven does not change, nor does the Dao." Therefore, it is only right and proper for intellectuals to sit down quietly to read and engage in professional work, and this cannot be changed. But from the viewpoint of materialist dialectics, whether in nature or human society, everything is developing and changing, and every thing is developing to a higher stage through a series of qualitative leaps. The state of stillness and equilibrium that we usually talk about is also a form of movement. Stillness and equilibrium are not absolute, but only temporary and relative; only movement is permanent and absolute. Therefore, sitting down quietly to read is by no means the only way to engage in professional work.
    Being accustomed to using metaphysical methods in professional work is the convention of bourgeois intellectuals in scientific research and teaching. This is another convention. It is different from the old rules and regulations and production quotas. The old rules and regulations have traces to follow, are easy to compare, and are easy to be discovered. However, this kind of convention in teaching and scientific research has no traces to follow, is not easy to compare, is not easy to be discovered, and is closely related to the bourgeois metaphysical research methods, making it even more difficult to break. Therefore, it is even more worthy of our attention, first finding the roots of the old professional views from the perspective of thinking methods, so that we can thoroughly eliminate them.
    The idea of not being interested in the current political movement against waste and conservatism, and wanting to sit down quietly to read and engage in professional work, is in fact a concrete manifestation of the idea of professional work being divorced from politics and emphasizing expertise over redness. There are quite a few people who have this idea. Some people still hold the idea of temporarily sacrificing some professional work to participate in political movements. They believe that movement is engaging in politics, while professional work needs to be done sitting down quietly. They do not understand that in a class society, scientific and cultural work has always served the class, that is to say, professional work and politics are closely related. Whether professional work serves a certain class is a matter of standpoint and also a political matter. When China's economic foundation has realized socialist transformation, and the whole country is experiencing tremendous changes and leaping forward politically and economically, the metaphysical nature of the thinking methods of intellectuals in science, culture and education who want to sit down quietly to read, is this not very obvious?
    Does participating in political movements really hinder "professional work"?
    In this political movement, the Xi'an First Aviation Industry School took the anti-waste movement as the key link, broke the old conventions of running schools, and created the example of running schools with socialist new methods, combining the "three diligences," "three releases," and "four combinations." This new method not only renewed the professional outlook of the school itself, but also opened up broad prospects for the development of socialist education. With this creation, our country has the possibility of spending several times less money, running several times more schools, and training several times more talents. Please see, anti-waste and anti-conservatism is a political movement, but through this political movement, Xi'an Aviation Industry School has achieved a great leap forward in professional work. The question is what point of view and attitude to take towards this movement. Those who lament that the movement hinders professional work, of course, cannot make such heroic achievements.
    As long as the viewpoint changes, distress turns into joy. Then, isn't it a good and joyful thing to discard metaphysical thinking and be a brave and progressive fighter for the socialist cause?

    打破另一种常规
    知萍
    每天的报纸都带来大量激动人心的消息。到处都在以乘风破浪之势，雷霆万钧之力，突破常规，向前跃进。保守之道大消，革命之道大长。人们都觉得在这个大跃进的浪潮中，谁要稍一松劲，就会被远远地抛在时代的后面。但也有些人被这种轰轰烈烈的局面吓得惊魂失魄，手足无措了。他们感到运动一个接着一个，太紧张了，不能够坐下来读读书，搞搞业务了，因此就有苦恼。
    为什么生活在同一时代，同一环境，而人们的思想感情竟会如此不同呢？撇开其他因素不谈，单从思想方法上讲，这是革命的辩证法与保守的形而上学之间的不同。从形而上学的观点看来，世界上一切东西都是从来如此，不会变化的。所谓天不变道亦不变。因此知识分子安静地坐下来读书搞业务，这也是天经地义不能改变的事。但从唯物辩证法的观点看来，不论自然界和人类社会，一切事物都是发展的、变化的，而且每一事物都在通过一系列的质的飞跃发展到更高阶段。我们平常所说的静止和平衡的状态，也是运动的一种形式。静止和平衡不是绝对的，只是暂时的、相对的；只有运动是永久的，绝对的。因此，坐下来静静地读书决不是搞业务的唯一的方法。
    习惯于用形而上学的方法从事业务，这是资产阶级知识分子在科学研究和教学业务上的常规。这是另一种常规。它和旧的规章制度和生产定额不同。旧的规章制度有迹象可寻，易于比较，易于被人发觉。而教学和科学研究业务上的这种成规，却无迹象可寻，不易比较，不易被人发觉，而且与资产阶级形而上学的研究方法密切联系，更加不容易打破。因此，也就更值得我们着重提出加以注意，首先从思想方法上找出旧的业务观点的根源，才能够彻底加以清除。
    对当前反浪费反保守的政治运动不感兴趣，愿意坐下来静静地读读书搞搞业务的思想，事实上是业务脱离政治、重专轻红的思想的具体表现。有这种思想的人，并不在少数。有些人还抱着暂时牺牲一些业务来参加政治运动的想法。他们认为运动就是搞政治，而业务是要坐下来静静地去搞的。不了解在阶级社会里科学文化业务从来就是为阶级服务的，就是说业务和政治两者是有密切联系的。业务为某一阶级服务这是个立场问题，也是个政治问题，当我国经济基础已实现了社会主义的改造之后，全国在政治上经济上经历着巨大变化向前跃进的时期，而科学和文教事业方面的知识分子却要坐下来静静地读书，这种思想方法的形而上学的性质难道不是很明显的吗？
    参加政治运动真的妨碍了“业务”吗？
    西安第一航空工业学校在这个政治运动中以反浪费运动为纲，打破了陈旧的办学的常规，创造了三勤、三放、四结合，用社会主义的新办法办学的范例。这种新办法不仅使学校本身的业务面貌为之一新，而且也为社会主义教育事业的发展开辟了广泛的前途。有了这个创造，我们的国家就有了少花几倍的钱，多办几倍的学校，多培养几倍人材的可能。请看，反浪费反保守是一个政治运动，而西安航空工业学校却通过这个政治运动，在业务上来了个大跃进。问题是在于用什么观点和态度来对待这个运动。悲叹运动妨碍了业务的人当然作不出这样的英雄事业的。
    只要观点一转，苦恼就变为乐趣。那么，抛掉形而上学的思想，作一个勇敢的前进的社会主义事业的战士，不正是一件好事而又同时是一件乐事吗？
