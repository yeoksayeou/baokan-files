    Well Resolved!
    The Yueyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Shiziqiao Township, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, achieved excellent results by uniformly arranging the time for collective labor within the cooperative and the personal household labor of its members. In the past, the Yueyuan Cooperative only paid attention to collective production and did not appropriately arrange time for the household labor of its members, resulting in the team leader having to urge people to work door-to-door every day, and still not getting a full turnout. After uniformly arranging the time for members' household labor, not only were the collective production tasks within the cooperative not delayed, but they were always completed ahead of schedule, and the members' household labor was also able to be carried out on time.
    This fact vividly tells us that the cooperative and its members are a relationship between the collective and the individual, which is a production relationship. Correctly handling the relationship between the two can improve the labor enthusiasm of the members and promote the development of the productive forces. Conversely, if we do not attach importance to handling the relationship between the two, and do not properly solve the existing problems between the two, then both collective and household production will be affected.
    The important task of leaders lies in paying attention to adjusting the problems between people that occur in the production process at any time. Therefore, the practice of the Yueyuan Cooperative is worth promoting.

    解决得好！
    湖南宁乡县狮子桥乡月圆农业社统一安排社内集体劳动和社员个人家务劳动的时间，收到了很好的效果。过去，月圆社光注意集体生产，没有适当安排社员的家务劳动时间，每天队长挨户催工，出工还是不齐。统一安排社员家务劳动时间以后，社内集体生产的任务不仅没有耽误，而且总是提前完成，社员的家务劳动也都能够按时进行。
    这个事实生动地告诉我们：社和社员是一种集体和个人的关系，也就是一种生产关系，正确地处理了二者之间的关系，就能提高社员的劳动积极性，促进生产力的发展。反过来说，如果不重视处理二者之间的关系，不妥善解决二者间已经存在的问题，那么，集体和家庭的生产都会受到影响。
    领导者的重要任务，就在于随时注意调整生产过程中所发生的人与人之间的问题。因此，月圆社的做法值得提倡。
