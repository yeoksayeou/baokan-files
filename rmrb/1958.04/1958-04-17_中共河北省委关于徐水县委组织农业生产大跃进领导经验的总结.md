Summary of the Experience of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee on the Leadership of the Xushui County Party Committee in Organizing the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production

Abstract

The 330,000 people of Xushui County, after three months of hard work, changed the natural landscape of the entire county. This made the masses even more confident that they could control their own destiny and no longer fear floods and droughts.

The main experience of Xushui County in organizing the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production is, first of all, to grasp political and ideological work. From the county to the grassroots, Party committees at all levels have managed to grasp production with one hand and ideology with the other, so that production work and ideological work beat the drums together. This has led to a new situation in political and ideological work – from following the masses in the past to leading them forward; from following the progress of production to promoting the leap forward in production; from being unable to closely connect with reality to being closely integrated with actual struggles, truly becoming a huge driving force for the Great Leap Forward.

Secondly, strengthening the front line, accurate and timely command, powerfully promoted the production movement and other work. Townships and villages are the "front line of combat". The county Party committee sent a large number of county-level organ cadres to the townships, solving the long-standing contradiction between the large county-level organization and the weak grassroots forces, resulting in a top-heavy structure. Due to the decentralization of cadres, red tape and personnel disputes in the leading organs have decreased, which has enabled the county Party committee members to spend two-thirds of their time "leaving the headquarters and personally commanding the battle on the front line", thereby reducing bureaucracy and improving leadership methods.

Thirdly, through rectification, they criticized departmentalism, localism, and purely professional viewpoints among cadres in various departments, uniting the forces of various departments to serve the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production with all their strength. In the beginning, most cadres did not have a clear understanding of the need for departmental work to serve production, and even regarded serving the central task as an extra burden. After the rectification, everyone realized that developing production is the foundation for developing all undertakings, the Great Leap Forward in production is the urgent demand of the masses, and it is the task of the entire Party and the entire people, as well as the task of all departments. Only by doing a good job in the central task can departmental work be better carried out.

The fourth point of leadership experience of the Xushui County Party Committee in organizing the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production is to correctly solve the relationship between key tasks and various tasks. In the same period, there are always many tasks to be completed. How can we grasp the key points and combine them with the completion of other tasks? The Xushui County Party Committee adopted the method of "unified leadership, dividing battle lines, focusing on breakthroughs, and combining multiple aspects." This not only achieved the organization of the forces of various departments to serve the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, but also further improved departmental work in conjunction with the central task. Grassroots cadres call this method "both comprehensive and specialized, both central and departmental, both specific and general."

In addition, the Xushui County Party Committee also adopted a series of methods such as experimentation, visits, promotion of advanced experiences, and evaluation competitions, so that production upsurges followed one after another, and advanced experiences blossomed everywhere. Now, the people of the entire county are continuing to work hard to achieve a grain yield of 500 jin per mu.

The 330,000 people of Xushui County, under the leadership of the Party, launched an agricultural production Great Leap Forward movement centered on water conservancy construction and pig raising and fertilizer accumulation in early November last year. After three months of hard work, they tamed three rivers,治理了二十七个山头, basically realized water conservancy, established a water storage and irrigation system, changed the natural landscape of the entire county, and also achieved a leap forward development in pig raising and fertilizer accumulation. Around the Great Leap Forward movement in agricultural production, many new developments have also emerged in other aspects, making this county leap from an ordinary county to an advanced county. Now, from the actions of changing the natural landscape, the people of the entire county are even more confident that they can control their own destiny and no longer fear floods and droughts, and are continuing to work hard to achieve a grain yield of 500 jin per mu this year.

This county has the Cao River, Pu River, and Ping River running through its entire territory. The riverbeds are narrow, the sources are short and the flow is rapid, the water is high and the east suffers disasters, and when there is little rain the west is dry, and there are disasters almost every year. In the past four years, the disaster-stricken area has been more than 870,000 mu, reducing grain production by about 170 million jin. The soil quality of the cultivated land in this county is also relatively poor, which the masses call "wet like sauce, dry like a kang", and the yield per mu is always around 200 jin. The county Party committee grasped the urgent demand of the broad masses of farmers to fundamentally control floods and droughts, and creatively implemented the Party Central Committee's directive of "emphasizing storage, emphasizing small-scale, and emphasizing people-run", so the water conservancy movement was smoothly launched, and 51 "grape bunch" style flood storage reservoirs, mainly small-scale and combined with medium and small-scale reservoirs, were quickly built along the three rivers, turning these three rivers into "treasure rivers" that benefit the people. On the vast plains, full use was made of saline, alkaline, and low-lying land to build 157 "starry sky" style plain storage and drainage reservoirs; and more than 1,300 old water storage pits and ponds were also transformed. The various water storage projects completed by the county before the flood season this year can store a total of 150 million cubic meters of water. If it encounters heavy rain like that in 1954 (587.5 mm of rainfall in one month); it can basically store the runoff of the county and prevent floods. The county has also clarified that the use of surface water and artesian spring water should be the main focus in terms of water use, so as to achieve interconnected reservoirs and channels. The county used 146 channels with a length of 524 li to connect the rivers, reservoirs, pits, and ponds to regulate water volume and complement each other's surpluses and deficiencies. In order to prevent long-term drought, the county also used methods such as digging artesian springs, bottom springs of pits and ponds, and drilling wells to make full use of groundwater. Now 265 mechanized wells and 4,382 brick and stone wells have been drilled, and 14 springs have been dug, with a discharge of 2.5 flows. In this way, channel irrigation and well irrigation are combined, and surface water and groundwater are supplemented, making 330,000 mu of cultivated land into "double insurance land" with both surface water and groundwater. The irrigation area of the county has increased from 360,000 mu last year to 840,000 mu, accounting for 97.6% of the total cultivated land of 860,000 mu, achieving the goal of no flooding in heavy rain and a guaranteed harvest without rain. The masses said with great enthusiasm, "What our predecessors dared not think of, we have now achieved!"

While doing a good job in water conservancy, the number of pigs raised has increased rapidly from 37,000 in early October last year to 139,000, an increase of two and a half times; the number of sheep has increased from 3,580 to more than 11,200, an increase of more than two times. At present, the average amount of crude fertilizer per mu has reached more than 8,000 jin, from the usual 3,000 jin, and applying 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu is now a certainty. This county has generally achieved feeding pigs without or with less grain. In order to do a good job in epidemic prevention, each commune has established livestock guidance clinics, with one pig doctor for every 1,000 pigs, one health worker for every 500 pigs, disinfection three times a week, and isolation pens for sick pigs. Currently, a "disease-free pig commune" movement is being carried out, and 37 communes have become "disease-free pig communes". Now all 259 agricultural cooperatives in the county have established collective pig farms, and the number of pigs raised collectively in 96 cooperatives exceeds the number of pigs raised by individual members. It is estimated that the number of pigs raised collectively by the communes can reach 70% before autumn.

In the magnificent struggle to conquer nature, the broad masses of farmers formed an invincible labor army. Usually 100,000 people, and at times 130,000 people (referring to able-bodied semi-laborers), fought on both sides of the three rivers and in the mountains and plains, "chasing the sun during the day, chasing the moon at night, turning the dark night into day, and making one day into two days." This is the decisive force that reversed the situation in Xushui in a very short period of time. In the past few months, the collective spirit displayed by the masses has been unprecedented. They actively implemented the unified plan for labor in the county, and were transferred to where they were needed and worked there. At the beginning, townships联合乡, and then the entire county 大联合, part of the labor force from 17 townships in the plains went to the mountains to build reservoirs, and farmers in the mountainous areas also supported the plains in water conservancy projects. In the past, there was a saying of "three no repairs" for water conservancy: no repairs without money, no repairs if it broke land boundaries, and no repairs if there was no direct benefit. Now this phenomenon of only caring about the local interests of one's own township or village, and even causing long-term disputes over water conservancy, has been swept away. Some farmers have even more loudly proposed that "鄉鄉互助搞水利，拐着弯算账都有利" , "治水大家干，福祸一线牵". In the past few months, the enthusiasm displayed by the masses has also been unprecedented. In the severe winter, the ground was frozen and the rivers were sealed, and all these difficulties were overcome by the masses. "思想不冻地不冻", "心硬地就软，心软地就硬", have become slogans for the masses to encourage each other to overcome difficulties.

The broad masses of cadres in the county also showed heroic spirit in the production upsurge, leading the masses to work hard in the fields, some fought on several reservoir construction sites, and did not go home for three or four months; others, regardless of the cold weather and cold water, took the lead in going into the water to repair reservoirs and dig springs. These actions greatly encouraged the masses, and some farmers said, "干部干的凶，不用费吐沫", so they were even more motivated. The county-level departments also correctly resolved the contradiction between the central task and the departmental work under the slogan of "everything for the Great Leap Forward, everything serves the Great Leap Forward", broke with conventions, and tried every means to serve the Great Leap Forward.

The great changes in the natural landscape of Xushui County have laid a solid foundation for achieving a grain yield of 500 jin per mu and realizing a Great Leap Forward in production this year. The great changes in the mental outlook of the broad masses of cadres and the masses are the guarantee for the great victories achieved in the past few months and for continuous battles in the future to achieve the Great Leap Forward plan. The most fundamental reason why Xushui County can do this is that, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the higher-level Party committee, the county Party committee resolutely implemented the spirit of rectification, improved its leadership with revolutionary spirit, eliminated officialdom, lethargy, arrogance, and squeamishness in Party organizations at all levels and among the broad masses of cadres; at the same time, it strengthened the unified leadership of the Party committee and opposed localism and decentralization; and after making a comprehensive plan on how to realize the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, it adopted various methods such as 放鸣放、辩论，试验、参观、评比, resolutely and freely mobilized the masses, and resolutely and creatively implemented the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

The leadership experience of the Xushui County Party Committee in organizing the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production can be summarized as follows:

Political work must come first.

The rectification and socialist education movement promoted the high tide of water conservancy construction, which made the county party committee deeply realize that politics is the commander and ideology is the soul. "Rectification is the key to all work." Therefore, it tightened up its political and ideological work and proposed that no matter what movement is led, "political work must come first." The county party committee especially tightened up the rectification movement, clarified that it should take the promotion of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production as the center, and made the rectification movement in county-level organs and rural areas deep and thorough. It promoted all thoughts and styles that were conducive to the Great Leap Forward in production and opposed all thoughts and styles that were not conducive to the Great Leap Forward in production.

The county party committee first tightened up the education of all cadres to make them understand how to treat the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. At the beginning, many people in the county-level organs and grassroots cadres had varying degrees of officialdom, lethargy, and conservative ideas. They were ideologically "frozen" in the face of the Great Leap Forward situation and were indifferent. They were high above, unwilling to go to the mountains and rural areas; they handled affairs according to conventions, and did not strive for progress; they said that the leap forward targets were too high, "halving them would be enough"; some people had more serious decentralist thinking, emphasizing the special nature of departmental business, and were unwilling to serve the agricultural leap forward. Some even did not accept the instructions of the party committee; there were also a few cadres who were pessimistic about the revolution, spending their days eating, drinking, and having fun, and not doing work. The county party committee adopted a method that combined leadership and the masses, such as individual talks, small-group criticism and debates, and large-group criticism and debates, to solve these problems, drew clear ideological boundaries, and improved the awareness of the broad masses of cadres. Many cadres compared this education to "wiping off oil sludge". With the oil sludge wiped off, they were active and happy in their daily work, and those with shortcomings and mistakes also strived to be advanced. The style of grassroots cadres has greatly improved, and almost all have participated in production, which the masses have responded to very well, saying that those cadres who did not participate in production in the past "are no longer the masters of the Tianqiao - just talking without practicing." "干部（指披着小大衣不干活）The cadres with four arms (referring to wearing overcoats and not working) are gone."

To carry out the agricultural Great Leap Forward movement, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses. After the socialist education movement, the masses in this county clarified the major issues of right and wrong between socialist and capitalist ideology and two roads, and their awareness was greatly improved. However, on the issue of the Great Leap Forward in production, there were still contradictions between advanced and conservative ideas, and contradictions between individualism, localism, and collectivist ideas. For example, on the issue of production targets, on the issue of breaking down township and cooperative boundaries and uniformly allocating labor to carry out water conservancy, and on the issue of starting construction in the cold winter months, some people found it difficult to accept for a while. The county party committee mobilized all propaganda tools and used all propaganda methods to strengthen political and ideological work among the masses, so that ideological work went to the "front line" and villages, fields, and water conservancy construction sites became classrooms, and everywhere was filled with a strong atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward. The masses have all been mobilized to launch a hot revolutionary competition for the Great Leap Forward in production.

Political and ideological work among cadres and the masses is carried out in various ways, one of the main methods being the mass self-education method, that is, the method of 大鸣大放大字报大辩论 (big blooming, big contending, big-character posters, big debate). For example, cadres have debated on issues such as: "Is agricultural production a gradual process or a leap forward?" "Is it better to build water conservancy on a large scale or a small scale?" "Should and can departmental work serve the central task?" The masses have debated on issues such as: "Should we go to other townships to carry out water conservancy?" "Can we carry out water conservancy on a large scale when the ground is frozen?" "Can we raise more pigs when there is less grain?" All of these have played a great role in carrying out the movement at that time. Now cadres and the masses are accustomed to the method of debate, and many people call the big debate "万灵药 (panacea)".

The general practice of Party committees at all levels in using the method of big debate is: First, debate on what to do. That is, before completing a major task, mobilize the masses to give voice, and then find out the problems that need to be debated from them, and solve them through big debate by the masses. Practice has proved that this is very effective. In the Yuzhuang Village canal project, there were four wealthy middle peasants, including Bai Luozhi, who said that "digging canals is a waste of effort and will not help." The construction site organized migrant workers to debate this statement, and as a result, the rights and wrongs were clarified, and the migrant workers were greatly educated. Before the debate, 1,400 migrant workers only opened 300 meters of canals in 14 days. After the debate, 1,000 migrant workers opened 500 meters of canals in three days. Second, debate on big issues on a large scale, and debate on small issues on a small scale. That is, issues with universal educational significance are debated on a larger scale, and smaller issues are debated on a smaller scale. By applying them separately in this way, they can be targeted, the masses are interested in participating, and the effect is great. Third, big debate covers small debate, and debate is deep and thorough. That is, after the general problem is clarified, further debate on specific problems is carried out to make the debate move from the general to the deep. Fourth, combine inspection, visits, and discovery of problems, and debate on the spot to solve problems on the spot. In this way, the facts are clear and the problems are solved quickly. Fifth, fully state the facts and reason things out in the debate, and prevent the debate from becoming a method of struggle and suppression. For this reason, the county party committee emphasized that the debate must allow people with different opinions to have full speaking rights, and must enable people to solve ideological problems in the face of facts and reasons.

The political and ideological work in this county has been able to become active and promote the Great Leap Forward in production movement, mainly because from the county to the grassroots, the party committee has grasped production with one hand and ideology with the other, so that production work and ideological work beat the drums together. Because of this, a new situation has emerged in political and ideological work, that is, from following the masses in the past to leading the masses forward and encouraging the masses to move forward; from following the progress of production to catching up with the production movement and promoting the Great Leap Forward in production; from being unable to closely connect with reality to being closely integrated with actual struggles, having a clear purpose, being lively and vigorous, and truly becoming a huge driving force for the Great Leap Forward.

Strengthen the Front Line

The Great Leap Forward in production movement is large in scale and has many aspects. Forces must be well organized and command must be accurate and timely. This forms a prominent contradiction with the small number of township-level cadres and their weak abilities (an average of two or three leading backbones per township). If the leadership of the township level is not strengthened, the large-scale production movement cannot be carried out well. Comparing the situation at the township level with the situation at the county level, the county party committee felt even more that the county-level organization was large, the grassroots forces were weak, and the structure was top-heavy. Upper-level cadres cannot go deep, and grassroots cadres are busy coping. As the township cadres said: "上边千条线，乡里一个蛋 (The upper level has thousands of threads, and the township has one egg)." This is a long-standing contradiction, and this problem must be solved. Therefore, the county party committee proposed that townships and villages are the "front line of combat" and are "fighting companies." It made the greatest determination and adopted revolutionary methods to completely solve this problem in the rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward in production movement.

First of all, the county party committee sent a large number of cadres from county-level organs to the townships. After repeated and thorough ideological work, a total of 255 people were sent in three batches, accounting for 32.3% of the total number of cadres in county-level organs. Among them, there were three members of the county party committee and 120 section chiefs. Eighty-seven of the stronger ones were selected to serve as the 正副书记(正副书记) of the township party committee, and the original 145 township cadres were sent to cooperatives (villages). At present, there are 273 township cadres in the county (of which county section chief-level cadres account for 43.9%), with an average of 11 people per township and 3 to 5 township party committee secretaries. At the same time, necessary adjustments were made to the cadres of some township party committees to greatly strengthen the leading core of the township. The county party committee clarified the following standards when selecting cadres: "听党的话 (Listen to the Party), have leap forward ideas, have drive, and have the spirit of research." "听党的话 (Listen to the Party)" means that they have a good party spirit, resolutely and conscientiously implement the Party's instructions, and work wholeheartedly for the Party without personal plans. "有干劲有钻劲 (Have drive and have the spirit of research)" means that they have revolutionary vigor, can study hard, and are not passive and tired. After the adjustments, the leading core of the township and cooperative (village) was completely in the hands of activists who were absolutely loyal to socialism, so that the party's team had unified thinking and will and was able to "fight independently and command independently."

Strengthening the front line and changing leadership methods is a revolution in the ideology of cadres. At first, some cadres in the departments had localism and were afraid that transferring backbones would affect departmental business. Some of the cadres who were transferred were afraid of hardship and afraid of losing their positions, and were unwilling to go to the grassroots. In order to clear ideological obstacles, they combined it with rectification and展开辩论展开辩论 in all the cadres of the county-level organs. In the big debate, various incorrect viewpoints and bourgeois individualism were criticized, and a glorious atmosphere of going to the countryside was generally created, and cadres were successfully transferred to strengthen the front line.

After 32.3% of the county cadres were decentralized, red tape and personnel disputes also decreased. This enabled the county party committee to spend more than two-thirds of its time "走出司令部，亲临前线指挥战斗 (leaving the headquarters and personally commanding the battle on the front line)", specifically helping the lower level to solve problems and reducing bureaucracy. This did not hinder collective leadership, on the contrary, it promoted collective leadership. "个人琢磨，碰头研究，开会决定，立即去办 (Individual thinking, meeting to study, making a decision at the meeting, and immediately handling it)" is a method often used by the county party committee. The county party committee also constantly held meetings at construction sites and on-site to discuss and solve problems on the spot.

Another method for the county party committee to strengthen the front line is to make full use of telephone conferences to directly communicate with cadres above the township and cooperative level, and to transmit leadership intentions, arrange work, disseminate experience, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner, and sometimes even conduct necessary debates. This not only reduced meetings by more than 70% and reports by more than 60%, but also powerfully promoted the production movement and other work.

Twist into a Rope

To organize the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, in addition to strengthening the front line, it is also urgently necessary to organize the forces of various departments at the county level, twist them together, and serve the Great Leap Forward with all their strength. At the beginning, most departments had localism and decentralism, and some lacked political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints, and did not have a clear understanding of the need for departmental work to serve the center. When the county party committee asked them to fully support the task of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, they showed various kinds of coping and resistance. The political and legal departments emphasized the special nature of their work, the education departments were afraid of affecting teaching, and the economic departments were always calculating profits and losses. Some departments did not actually respect the unified leadership of the party committee, but they turned around and said that the county party committee did not pay attention to their work; some departments even regarded the tasks given by the county party committee to realize the Great Leap Forward in agriculture as an extra burden.

In the rectification movement of the organs, the county party committee organized cadres from various departments to conduct Mingfang debates on the issues of "Is the Great Leap Forward in agriculture being carried out by a few people or by the entire party and the entire people", "Does serving the central task affect departmental work", and "Can departmental work be done well by relying only on oneself". In the debates, it criticized decentralism, localism, and purely professional viewpoints, and further clarified the service to politics, so that everyone realized that developing production is the foundation for developing all undertakings, the agricultural Great Leap Forward is the most urgent demand of the masses, it is the task of the entire party and the entire people, and it is also the task of all departments. Only by doing a good job in the central task can departmental work be better carried out.

After solving the ideological problems, the county party committee then proposed that all departments should be twisted into a rope under the unified leadership of the party committee to serve the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, and instructed each department to formulate a plan to serve the Great Leap Forward. The county party committee vigorously helped them solve the difficulties encountered by the departments in the process of serving the Great Leap Forward. At the same time, it also adopted the method of grasping both ends and bringing along the middle, timely rewarding departments that served the Great Leap Forward well, and criticizing the bad ones to promote the progress of all departments. In this way, the forces of all aspects were mobilized, and a high tide of supporting the Great Leap Forward in agriculture was quickly set off. The Commerce Bureau and the Postal and Telecommunications Bureau leaped from being uncooperative with the central work to the most advanced units in supporting the Great Leap Forward in agriculture. In these three months, the Commerce Bureau purchased 120,000 piglets, supplied a large number of well-drilling equipment, iron picks,土筐 (earth baskets), explosives, charcoal, draught animals, coarse feed, prickly ash seeds,水浮莲 (water hyacinth), tree seedlings, etc., and also purchased agricultural products and waste products worth 657,000 yuan, and established a livestock farm to breed superior livestock. The Postal and Telecommunications Bureau made telephone access possible in 25 townships in half a month, and creatively installed telephone conference equipment with simple methods, which greatly facilitated the leadership, and the cadres in the county were extremely satisfied. In short, the old appearances of the various departments have undergone great changes, unreasonable rules and regulations have been broken, and the officialdom, lethargy, arrogance, and squeamishness have been swept away. Because of these changes, the peasants reflected: "城里什么时候也能办事了 (City people can handle affairs now), everything is easy to handle", "城里各机关真正支援农业大跃进 (All the organs in the city are really supporting the Great Leap Forward in agriculture)."

Focus on Key Points, Combine Multiple Aspects

In the same period, there are many tasks to be completed, and it is necessary to focus on key points. To tightly grasp the key points and combine them with the completion of other tasks, it is necessary to make overall arrangements. Since last winter, it is precisely because the county party committee has done this that it has promoted the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy construction and pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, and completed tasks such as conscription, party rectification, commune rectification, anti-rightist, and除四害 (eliminate the four pests), and there has been a Great Leap Forward in all aspects of work centered on agricultural production. The county party committee calls this leadership method "统一领导，划分战线，重点突出，多边结合 (unified leadership, dividing battle lines, focusing on key points, and combining multiple aspects)." The so-called focus on key points is, as mentioned earlier, twisting the forces of various departments into a rope and focusing on serving the central task. However, the county party committee did not disregard departmental work and other work, but adopted the method of "多边结合 (combining multiple aspects)" around the key points to further grasp the work of various departments. This method solves the contradiction that the central work and departmental work are not coordinated enough. In the past, some uncoordinated phenomena occurred mainly because the cadres of departmental work had tendencies of localism, decentralism, and indifference to politics. They opposed the central work and departmental work, mistakenly believing that the central work was a matter for the county party committee and the business work was a matter for the department. In addition, restricted by some unreasonable rules and regulations, when the instructions of their directly affiliated superiors and the instructions of the county party committee were inconsistent, they often only paid attention to the instructions of their directly affiliated superiors and did not conscientiously implement the instructions of the party committee. On the other hand, the party committee also has shortcomings in arranging departmental work improperly, grasping it tightly enough, and not taking care of it enough; or when organizing various departments to serve the central work, it focused on transferring cadres from the departments to the countryside to engage in central work, ignoring serving the central work through the business of various departments, and even if some requirements were put forward, they were mostly not specific. In order to solve this problem, the county party committee adopted the method of "party committee making overall arrangements, departments cooperating with each other, relying on mobilizing the masses, and everyone working together to complete" under the principle of "focusing on key points and combining multiple aspects", and solved the combination problem of the central work and departmental work. The specific methods are:

(1) When arranging the central work tasks for each stage, the county party committee also arranges departmental work, puts forward specific requirements, and highlights the central work while placing departmental work in an appropriate position. This approach has been consistently implemented in townships and villages. For example, if the central work is spring ploughing and wheat management, the work of various departments will be arranged around this center: the Commerce Bureau should complete the task of purchasing 2.1 million yuan of waste products to solve the current problems of some people's livelihood difficulties and production investment. Handicraft cooperatives and iron factories should complete the task of manufacturing 2,500 "营养钵 (nutrient pots)" (tools for raising seedlings) and manufacturing and repairing agricultural tools. Other tasks, such as bank savings, the Grain Bureau's purchase of substitute foods, and the political and legal departments training bad elements (to prevent the creation of rumors and the making of sacred water), have all been given specific tasks. In this way, the business of the departments is enlivened and effectively supports the central work.

(2) After unified arrangements are made, the county party committee also divides the battle lines, assigns responsibilities, and strengthens the specific leadership of the central work and all aspects of work. In addition to dividing responsibilities according to the mouth in general aspects, the county party committee also temporarily divides several small battle lines in each period according to the current work tasks. In the stage centered on water conservancy, the county party committee divided the 瀑河水库 (Pu River Reservoir), the Plain Reservoir, digging springs, building terraces and water cellars in mountainous areas, opening canals and leveling land in plains, as well as material supply, rectification, industry, 除四害 (eliminating the four pests), animal husbandry and sideline occupations, rice planting and other 11 battle lines. Each battle line has one to two county committee members in charge of management.

(3) Mobilize the basic organizations of each township and cooperative and all cadres who have been dispatched to the countryside to not only complete the central work but also complete the departmental work. The responsible cadres at all levels implement the "三包 (three packages)" (package area, package department, package crop). After the work team is dispatched to a village, it is responsible for all tasks. When cadres from the departments are transferred to do the central work, they are also required to do a good job in the central work while making sure to finish the department work.For example, the police can go to areas with more cases, so it can be taken care of. The cadres were also required to be good in the main job while on this, they create experience with that dept. If they create a good system, the Party then implements it to all departments. This way the departments worked and the main goal. The locals called this "又全又专 (All-rounder and specalist), 又中心又部门 (central and departmental), 又具体又一般 (specific and general)"

(4) Organize the joint actions between departments. According to the central work and other important work tasks of each period, the county party committee has formed a joint office with the main department in charge and the participation of relevant departments. For example, joint offices for material supply, water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, rectification, and the elimination of the four pests. In this way, the smooth progress of the central task is guaranteed, and the coordination of all relevant departments is also achieved.

The application of multi-faceted combination is multi-faceted, the combination method is flexible, and the combination method is also diverse. Because of this multi-faceted combination, the central work has achieved remarkable results, and the work of the departments has also been completed very well. Although some departments have fewer people, they are doing more things, and there are many creations. The phenomenon of departments pulling each other's legs and passing the buck in the past has been overcome. The comrades in the departments unanimously reflected that in the past three months, they have truly understood "听党的话，为生产服务，走群众路线 (Listen to the Party, serve production, and follow the mass line)." They attribute the achievements to these three sentences.

Experiment, Visit, Promote

Water conservancy, flood elimination, and fertilizer accumulation are all large-scale mass movements. To carry out such a large mass movement, there must be leadership experience preparation and effective mobilization of the masses. The Xushui County Party Committee adopted the method of all things passing through experimentation, visits, and promotion, and solved the above problems very well.

When the county party committee, according to the instructions of the superiors and the experience of other places, wanted to build plain reservoirs in the plains and low-lying areas, it did not proceed from subjective wishes or mechanically copy the experience of other places and act rashly. They first studied where it was most suitable to build plain reservoirs, and instructed four members of the county party committee to cooperate with the township party committee to go deep into the villages to investigate and study and consult with the masses. As a result, the masses were very satisfied and also asked "快修，修大的 (Build quickly, build big ones)". The masses said: "这一下可找到了治水的好办法，要修就要把水圈住，不要叫它跑掉了 (This is a good way to control water. To build, we must trap the water and not let it run away)." According to the opinions of the masses, the county party committee decided to build the first plain reservoir in the Shigecun low-lying area, and organized cadres and masses from 12 townships to participate in the construction of the reservoir from beginning to end. After on-site experimentation and on-site visits, the cadres and masses of these townships quickly learned the technology of building plain reservoirs and recognized its benefits. After returning, the cadres of each township and cooperative organized their labor forces in accordance with the county's unified plan and quickly set off a climax of building plain reservoirs. This approach has also been applied in carrying out other tasks.

The county party committee paid special attention to going deep into the masses, discovering advanced models, organizing cadres to visit, and promoting from point to surface. The main method of promoting advanced experience is to mobilize and organize the party committee secretaries and presidents of each township and cooperative to personally visit the actual site, hold meetings on the spot, discuss on the spot, and formulate plans for their own township and cooperative. In this way, visiting, holding meetings, and planning at the same time can quickly promote an advanced experience and constantly establish guiding ideology on an advanced basis and actively lead the masses forward. The cadres were very satisfied with this kind of on-site meeting. They said: "到实地一看，就搞通了思想，办法也学的周全 (Once you see it on the spot, you understand the thinking, and you learn the methods comprehensively)." According to statistics, in the past three months, seven large-scale visits were organized

    中共河北省委关于徐水县委组织农业生产大跃进领导经验的总结
    内容提要
    徐水县三十三万人民，经过三个月苦战，改变了全县的自然面貌。这就使群众更加相信自己能掌握自己的命运，再也不怕水旱灾害了。
    徐水县组织农业生产大跃进的主要经验，首先是抓政治思想工作。从县到基层，各级党委都作到了一手抓生产，一手抓思想，使生产工作与思想工作两面锣鼓一齐敲。这就使政治思想工作出现了一种新局面——由过去跟着群众跑，变为带着群众跑；由跟着生产进度跑，变为推动生产跃进；由不能紧密联系实际，变为与实际斗争紧密结合，真正成为大跃进的巨大动力。
    其次，加强第一线，指挥准确及时，有力地推动了生产运动和其它工作。乡、村是“作战的第一线”。县委把大批县级机关干部下放到乡，解决了长期存在的县级组织机构庞大和基层力量薄弱的头重脚轻的矛盾。由于干部下放，领导机关的文牍主义、人事纠纷随着减少了，这也就使县委委员们能有三分之二的时间“走出司令部，亲临前线指挥战斗”，从而减少了官僚主义，改进了领导方法。
    第三、通过整风，批判了各部门干部中的分散主义、本位主义和单纯业务观点，把各部门的力量拧在一起，全力为农业生产大跃进服务。开始，多数干部对部门工作必须为生产服务认识不明确，甚至把为中心工作看作额外负担。整风后，大家认识到：发展生产是发展一切事业的基础，生产大跃进是当前群众的迫切要求，是全党全民的任务，也是各部门的任务，只有把中心工作搞好，部门工作才能更好地开展。
    徐水县委组织农业生产大跃进的第四点领导经验，是正确地解决了重点工作和各项工作之间的关系。在同一时期，总有许多任务要完成，怎样才能既掌握了重点，又结合完成其它各项任务？徐水县委采取了“统一领导，划分战线，重点突击，多边结合”的办法。这样做，既达到了组织各部门力量为农业生产大跃进服务，又结合中心工作进一步搞好部门工作。基层干部把这个方法叫做“又全又专，又中心又部门，又具体又一般。”
    此外，徐水县委还采取了试验、参观、推广先进经验和评比竞赛等一系列的办法，使生产高潮一个紧接着一个地掀起来，使先进经验遍地开花。现在，全县人民正在为亩产五百斤粮食继续苦战。
    徐水县三十三万人民，在党的领导下，于去年11月初展开以水利建设和养猪积肥为中心的农业生产大跃进运动。经过三个月苦战，驯服了三条河流，治理了二十七个山头，基本上实现了水利化，建立了蓄水灌溉体系，改变了全县的自然面貌，养猪积肥也有了飞跃的发展。围绕着农业生产大跃进运动，其他方面的工作也出现了许多新的气象，使这县由一般县份一跃成为一个先进县份。现在，全县人民从改变自然面貌的行动中，更加相信自己能掌握自己的命运，再也不怕水旱灾害，正为实现今年亩产粮食五百斤，继续苦战。
    这县有漕河、瀑河、萍河贯穿全境，河身狭窄，源短流急，水大东部闹灾，雨少西部则旱，几乎年年有灾。近四年来，遭灾的面积就有八十七万多亩，减产粮食约一亿七千多万斤。这县耕地的土质也较坏，群众称之为“湿了赛如酱，干了赛如炕”，亩产总在二百斤左右。县委抓住了广大农民根治水旱灾害的迫切要求，又创造性地执行了党中央指示的“以蓄为主，以小型为主，以民办为主”的方针，所以水利运动顺利展开，很快在三河沿岸修建了“葡萄串”式的五十一座以小型为主、中小型相结合的蓄洪作物水库，使这三条河流，变成了为人民造福的“宝河”。在广大平原上，充分利用了盐、碱、洼地，建成了一百五十七座“满天星”式的平原蓄沥作物水库；还改造了一千三百多个旧有的蓄水坑塘。全县在今年汛期前完成的各种蓄水工程，共可蓄水一亿五千万公方，如果再遇到像1954年那样的大雨（一个月降雨五八七点五公厘）；能够基本上蓄住本县的径流，不致发生水灾。这县还明确了在用水方面要以使用地上水、自流泉水为主，做到库库相连、渠渠相通。全县用开挖的五百二十四华里长的一百四十六条渠道，把各河道、水库、坑塘连接起来，调剂水量，互补余缺。为了防止长期干旱，这县还用了挖掘自流泉、坑塘下泉和打机井等方法，充分利用地下水。现在已打成机井二百六十五眼，砖石土井四千三百八十二眼，凿泉十四处，已出水二点五个流量。这样，渠灌和井灌相结合，地上水和地下水相补充，使三十三万亩耕地变成既有地上水又有地下水的“双保险地”。全县的灌溉面积，由去年三十六万亩发展到八十四万亩，占总耕地八十六万亩的97.6％，达到了大水不淹地，无雨保丰收。群众豪情志壮地说：“前人不敢想的事，我们现在做到了！”
    在搞好水利的同时，养猪已经由去年10月初的三万七千头急增到十三万九千头，增加了两倍半；羊由三千五百八十只增到一万一千二百多只，增加两倍多。目前每亩平均粗肥，已由常年的三千多斤达到八千多斤，亩施万斤肥已十拿九稳。这县普遍实现了不用粮食或少用粮食喂猪。为了做好防疫，各社设立了畜牧指导诊疗所，每千头猪有一名猪医生，每五百头猪有一名保健员，三天一次消毒，并设立了病猪隔离圈。当前正在开展“无病猪社”运动，已有三十七个社成为“无病猪社”。现在全县二百五十九个农业社，都设立了集体养猪场，有九十六个社集体养猪的数量超过了社员个人养猪的数量。预计秋前社养猪可达到70％。
    在征服自然的宏伟斗争中，广大农民组成了一支战无不胜的劳动大军。平时十万人，多时十三万人（指整半劳力），转战三河两岸和山地、平原，“白天赶太阳，夜晚追月亮，黑夜当白日，一天当两天”。这是很短时期内在徐水扭转乾坤的决定力量。几个月当中，群众表现的集体主义精神是前所未有的。他们积极执行了全县劳力的统一规划，调到那里，干到那里。开始时乡与乡联合，进而全县大联合，平原十七个乡的部分劳力上山修水库，山区农民也支援平原搞水利工程。过去搞水利有“三不修”的说法：没钱不修，打破地界不修，不直接受益不修。现在一扫这种只顾本乡、本村局部利益甚至为水利长期闹纠纷的现象。有些农民更响亮地提出“乡乡互助搞水利，拐着弯算账都有利”，“治水大家干，福祸一线牵”。几个月中，群众表现的干劲也是前所未有的。数九寒天，地冻河封，这一切困难都被群众战胜。“思想不冻地不冻”“心硬地就软，心软地就硬”，成为群众互相鼓舞战胜困难的响亮口号。
    全县广大干部，也在生产高潮中表现了英雄气概，带领群众苦战田野，有的转战数个水库工地，三、四个月不回家；有的不顾天寒水冷，带头下水修水库、挖泉。这些行动大大鼓舞了群众，有些农民说：“干部干的凶，不用费吐沫”，因此干劲更足。县级各部门，也在“一切为了大跃进，一切服务于大跃进”的口号下，正确地解决了中心工作与部门工作的矛盾，打破了常规，千方百计为大跃进服务。
    徐水县自然面貌的大变化，为今年亩产粮食五百斤、实现生产大跃进奠定了可靠的基础。广大干部和群众的精神面貌的大变化，是过去几个月取得巨大胜利和今后连续战斗以实现大跃进计划的保证。徐水县所以能够作到这样，最根本的，是县委在党中央和上级党委的领导下，坚决贯彻了整风精神，以革命的气魄改进了领导，扫除了各级党组织和广大干部中的官风、暮气、骄气和娇气；同时，加强了党委的统一领导，反掉了本位主义、分散主义；并且对怎样实现农业大跃进进行了全面规划之后，采取了鸣放、辩论，试验、参观、评比等等多种办法，坚决地、放手地发动群众，坚决地、创造性地贯彻执行了多快好省的建设方针。
    徐水县委组织农业生产大跃进的领导经验，概括起来，主要有以下几点：兵马要动，政治先行
    整风和社会主义教育运动推动了水利建设高潮，使县委深刻体会到政治是统帅，思想是灵魂，“整风是提起一切工作的纲”，因此就更抓紧了政治、思想工作，提出不论领导什么运动，都必须“兵马要动，政治先行”。县委特别抓紧了整风运动，并明确了以推动农业生产大跃进为中心，把县级机关和农村的整风运动搞深搞透，发扬一切利于生产大跃进的思想、作风，反掉一切不利于生产大跃进的思想、作风。
    县委首先抓紧了对全体干部的教育，使他们懂得应当怎样对待农业生产大跃进。开始，在县级机关和基层干部中，许多人有着不同程度的官风、暮气，保守思想，他们在大跃进形势面前，思想“冻结”，无动于衷；高高在上，不愿上山下乡；照常规办事，不发奋图强；说跃进指标太高，“减一半就行了”；有些人有比较严重的分散主义思想，强调部门业务特殊，不愿为农业跃进服务，甚至有的不接受党委的指示；还有少数干部，革命意志消沉，终日吃喝玩乐，不干工作。县委采用了个别谈话、小会批评辩论、大会批评辩论等领导与群众结合的办法，解决了这些问题，划清了思想界限，提高了广大干部的觉悟。许多干部把这次教育比做“擦油泥”。油泥擦掉，平日工作积极的精神愉快，有缺点错误的也力争先进。基层干部的作风大有改进，几乎全部参加了生产，群众反映很好，说那些过去不参加生产的干部，“不再是天桥的把式——光说不练了。”“四个胳膊的干部（指披着小大衣不干活）没有了”。
    开展农业大跃进运动，需要对群众进行充分的发动。这县的群众经过社会主义教育运动，辨明了社会主义和资本主义两种思想两条道路的大是大非问题，觉悟大大提高，但是在生产大跃进问题上，还有着先进思想和保守思想的矛盾，个人主义、本位主义与集体主义思想的矛盾。比如在生产指标问题上，在打破乡、社界限，统一调配劳动力搞水利问题上，也在十冬腊月动工问题上，有些人就一时很难接受。县委把一切宣传工具都动员起来，运用一切宣传方式，加强了在群众中的政治思想工作，使思想工作上了“前线”，使村庄、田野、水利工地成为课堂，到处充满浓厚的大跃进气氛。群众都动员起来为生产大跃进展开热火朝天的革命竞赛。
    在干部、群众中的政治思想工作，是通过各种方式进行的，其中主要的一种，是群众性的自我教育方式，即大鸣大放大字报大辩论的方式。例如在干部中曾经辩论过：“农业生产是渐进还是要跃进？”“修水利是大搞好还是小搞好？”“部门工作应当不应当和能不能为中心任务服务？”等问题；在群众中辩论过：“应当不应当到其它乡搞水利？”“地冻能不能大搞水利？”“粮食少能不能多养猪？”等问题，都对当时开展运动起到很大作用。现在干部、群众已习惯了辩论的方式，许多人把大辩论叫做“万灵药”。
    各级党委运用大辩论方式，一般的做法是：第一、做什么辩论什么。就是在每完成一项大的任务之前，发动群众鸣放，然后从中找出需要辩论的问题，由群众经过大辩论来解决。事实证明，这样做效果很好。修于庄村渠道工程中，有白洛志等四个富裕中农，说什么“开渠是白费工，不顶事。”工地上组织民工对这种说法展开辩论，结果把是非辩清，民工们都受到很大教育。辩论前，一千四百民工十四天只开渠三百公尺，辩论后，一千民工三天就开五百公尺。第二、大事大辩，小事小辩。即带有普遍教育意义的问题，在较大的范围内大辩，较小的问题，就在较小的范围内小辩。这样分别应用，能够有的放矢，群众有兴趣参加，效果也大。第三、大辩套小辩，辩深又辩透。即总的问题辩清以后，进一步辩论具体问题，使辩论由一般引向深入。第四、结合检查、参观，发现问题，现场辩论，就地解决问题。这样辩论，事实鲜明，问题解决得快。第五、辩论中充分摆事实，讲道理，防止把辩论当成斗争和压服的方法。为此，县委强调了辩论一定要允许有不同意见的人有充分发言的权利，一定要使人们在事实和道理面前解决思想问题。
    这县的政治思想工作，能够活跃起来，推动生产大跃进运动，主要原因是，从县到基层，作到了党委一手抓生产，一手抓思想，使生产工作与思想工作两面锣鼓一齐敲。因为这样，就使政治思想工作出现了一种新的情况，即由过去的跟着群众跑，变为带着群众跑，鼓舞群众前进；由跟着生产进度跑，变为赶到生产运动前面，推动生产跃进；由不能紧密联系实际，变为与实际斗争紧密结合，有的放矢，生动活泼，真正成为大跃进的巨大动力。加强第一线
    生产大跃进运动，规模大，方面多，力量须很好组织，指挥要准确及时，这与乡级干部数量少、能力弱（每乡领导骨干平均二、三人）形成突出的矛盾。如果不加强乡级领导力量，大生产运动就不能很好地开展。把乡级的这种情况与县级的情况加以对照，县委更感到县级组织机构庞大，基层力量薄弱，头重脚轻。上层干部不能深入，基层干部忙于应付，正如乡干部说的：“上边千条线，乡里一个蛋”。这是长期存在的矛盾，这个问题非解决不可。因此，县委提出乡、村是“作战的第一线”，是“战斗连队”，下了最大决心，采取革命办法，在整风运动和生产大跃进运动中彻底解决了这个问题。
    首先，县委把大批县级机关的干部下放到乡。经过反复深透的思想工作，分三批共下放了二百五十五名，占县级机关干部总数的32.3％。其中有县委委员三名，科局股长一百二十名，从中挑出较强的八十七名担任了乡党委正副书记，并将原来一百四十五名乡干部下放到社（村）。目前，全县有二百七十三名乡干部（其中县科局长级干部占43.9％），平均每乡十一人，乡党委书记三至五人。与此同时，对部分乡党委的干部进行了必要的调整，使乡的领导核心大为加强。县委在挑选干部时，明确了这样的标准：“听党的话，有跃进思想，有干劲，有钻劲”。“听党的话”，就是党性好，执行党的指示坚决、认真，全心全意为党工作，没有个人打算。“有干劲有钻劲”，就是有革命朝气，能钻研，不消极疲沓。经过调整，乡、社（村）的领导核心完全掌握在绝对忠于社会主义的积极分子手中，使党的队伍思想意志统一了，能够“独立作战，独立指挥”了。
    加强第一线，改变领导方法，是干部思想上的一次革命。起初，有些部门的干部有本位主义，怕调走骨干影响部门业务。被抽调的干部有些人怕吃苦、怕丢官，不愿到基层去。为了扫清思想障碍，曾结合整风，在县级机关全体干部中，对“应不应该加强第一线”展开辩论。在大辩论中，批判了各种不正确的观点和资产阶级个人主义思想，普遍造成了下乡光荣的气氛，顺利地抽调了干部，加强了第一线。
    县干部下放了32.3％，文牍主义，人事纠纷也减少了。这就使县委能有三分之二以上的时间“走出司令部，亲临前线指挥战斗”，具体帮助下边解决问题，减少了官僚主义。这样并没有妨碍了集体领导，相反，还促进了集体领导。“个人琢磨，碰头研究，开会决定，立即去办”是县委经常采用的一种方法。县委还不断在工地、现场开会，就地讨论、解决问题。
    县委加强第一线的另一个办法，是充分利用电话会议，直接与各乡社、队长以上干部互通声息，随时传达领导意图，布置工作，传播经验，及时发现问题，解决问题，有时还进行必要的辩论。这样不仅减少会议70％以上，表报60％以上，而且有力地推动了生产运动和其他工作。
    拧成一根绳
    组织农业生产大跃进，除了必须加强第一线外，还迫切需要组织起县级各部门的力量，把它们拧在一起，全力为大跃进服务。开始，多数部门存在着本位主义、分散主义，有的缺乏政治观点、生产观点、群众观点，对部门工作必须为中心服务，认识不明确。当县委向他们提出全力支援农业大跃进的任务时，表现出各种各样的应付及抗拒。政法部门强调自己的工作特殊，教育部门怕影响教学，经济部门总是在赔钱赚钱上打算盘。有的部门实际上并不尊重党委的统一领导，但他们却反转过来说县委不重视他们的工作；有的部门甚至把县委为实现农业大跃进而给予的一定任务看成是额外负担。
    县委在机关整风运动中，组织各部门干部对“农业大跃进是少数人搞还是全党全民搞”，“为中心工作服务是不是影响部门工作”，“部门工作光靠自己能不能搞好”等问题，进行了鸣放辩论，在辩论中批判了分散主义、本位主义和单纯业务观点，进一步明确了为政治服务，使大家认识到：发展生产是发展一切事业的基础，农业大跃进是当前群众最迫切的要求，是全党全民的任务，也是各部门的任务，只有把中心工作搞好，部门工作才能更好地开展。
    在解决了思想问题之后，县委接着提出了，各部门要在党委统一领导下拧成一根绳，服务于农业生产大跃进，并责成各部门制定了为大跃进服务的规划。各部门在为大跃进服务的过程中，遇到了困难，县委大力帮助他们解决，同时还采取了抓两头带中间的办法，及时奖励为大跃进服务好的部门；批评了不好的，促使各部门一齐前进。这样，把各方面的力量动员起来，很快掀起了支援农业大跃进的高潮。商业局和邮电局就由不积极配合中心工作一跃而为支援农业大跃进最先进的单位。商业局在这三个月里，购进了十二万头猪秧，供应了大批打井器材、铁镐、土筐、炸药、木炭、耕畜、粗饲料、花椒籽、水浮莲、树秧等，同时收购了价值六十五点七万元的农产品和废品，并成立了畜牧场繁殖优畜。邮电局在半个月内使二十五个乡都通了电话，并创造性地用简易办法安装了电话会议的设备，大大便利了领导，全县干部极为满意。总之，各个部门的老样子都起了大变化，打破了不合理的规章制度，官气、暮气、骄气、娇气一扫而光。因为有了这些变化，农民反映：“城里什么时候也能办事了，什么事也好办了”“城里各机关真正支援农业大跃进了。”
    重点突出，多边结合
    在同一时期，有许多任务要完成，又必须有重点。紧紧地掌握重点，结合完成其他各项任务，就需要统筹安排。去冬以来，县委正是因为这样做，才推动了水利建设和养猪积肥大跃进，并完成了征兵、整党、整社、反右派、除四害等任务，出现了以农业生产为中心的各方面工作的大跃进。对这种领导方法，县委把它叫做“统一领导，划分战线，重点突出，多边结合。”所谓重点突出，就是前面所说的把各部门的力量拧成一根绳，突出的为中心任务服务。但是县委并没有把部门工作和其他工作置于不顾，而是围绕着重点采取了“多边结合”的办法，进一步把各部门的工作抓起来。这个方法解决了中心工作和部门工作不够协调的矛盾。过去所以发生一些不协调现象，主要是由于部门工作干部有本位主义、分散主义和不问政治的倾向。他们把中心工作和部门工作对立起来，错误地认为中心工作是县委的事，业务工作是部门的事，再加上有一些不合理的规章制度的束缚，遇到其直属上级指示和县委指示不一致的时候，就往往只重视直属上级的指示，不认真执行党委的指示。另一方面，党委对部门工作也有安排不当、抓的不紧、照顾不够的缺点；或者在组织各部门为中心工作服务时，偏重于抽调部门的干部下乡搞中心工作，忽视通过各部门的业务为中心工作服务，即便提出一些要求，也多不具体。为了解决这个问题，县委在“重点突出、多边结合”的原则下，采取了“党委统筹安排、部门互相协作、依靠发动群众、大家动手完成”的作法，解决了中心工作和部门工作的结合问题。具体方法是：
    （一）县委在安排每一阶段的中心工作任务时，同时安排部门工作，提出具体要求，既把中心工作加以突出，又把部门工作摆在适当位置。这种作法，一直贯彻到乡、村。如中心工作是春耕播种和小麦管理，就围绕这一中心安排各部门的工作：商业局要完成收购二百一十万元废品的任务，解决目前一些群众生活困难和生产投资的问题。手工业社、铁工厂要完成制造“营养钵”（育苗用的工具）二千五百件以及制造修配农具的任务。其他如银行储蓄、粮食局采购代食品、政法部门训练坏分子（防止造谣言闹圣水）等，都提出了具体任务。这样，部门的业务活跃起来，就有力地支持了中心工作。
    （二）在统一安排以后，县委又划分战线，分工负责，来加强中心工作和各方面工作的具体领导。县委除在总的方面按口分工负责外，在每个时期，根据当前的工作任务还临时划分若干小战线。在以水利为中心的阶段，县委曾划分了瀑河水库、平原水库、凿泉、山区修梯田水窖、平原开渠平整土地以及物资供应、整风、工业、除四害、畜牧副业、种稻等十一条战线，每个战线都有一至二名县委分工管理。
    （三）发动各乡、社基层组织和所有下乡干部，既要完成中心工作，也要完成部门工作。各级负责干部实行“三包”（包片、包部门、包作物），工作组下乡干部到一片、一村后，对各项工作都负责。在抽调部门干部作中心工作时，也尽可能照顾到部门业务的需要，什么地方业务多，就派他们到什么地方去。例如案件多的地区，就派政法部门的干部去。对于下乡干部不仅要求他们作好中心工作，还要求他们结合中心工作做好部门工作，并责成部门干部分片搞中心工作时创造本部门工作的经验，由党委向全面推广。这样党委全面抓，大家协同作，中心工作和部门工作都能做好，大家都满意。基层干部把这种方法叫作“又全又专，又中心又部门，又具体又一般”。
    （四）组织部门之间的协同动作。县委根据每个时期的中心工作及其他重要工作任务，曾以主管部门为主，吸收有关部门参加组成联合办公室。例如物资供应、水利积肥、整风、除四害等联合办公室。这样，既保证了中心任务的顺利进行，也作到了各有关部门的协同一致。
    多边结合的运用是多方面的，结合的方法是灵活的，结合的方式也是多种多样的。由于这样多边结合，中心工作成绩显著，部门的工作也完成的很好。有些部门人手虽然减少，作的事情却多了，并有许多的创造。过去那种部门之间互相牵掣、互相推诿的现象克服了。部门的同志一致反映，三个月来，使我们真正懂得了“听党的话，为生产服务，走群众路线”。他们把成绩归功于这三句话。
    试验、参观、推广
    兴水利、除水害、搞积肥，都是大规模的群众运动，开展这样大的群众运动，要有领导经验的准备，也要有效地发动群众。徐水县委采用一切经过试验、参观、推广的办法，很好地解决了上述问题。
    县委根据上级的指示和外地经验要在平原、洼地兴修平原水库时，并没有从主观愿望出发，或者机械地搬用外地经验，贸然从事。他们首先研究在什么地方修平原水库最适宜，又责成四名县委委员协同乡党委，深入到村调查研究，同群众商量。结果，群众非常满意，还要求“快修，修大的”。群众说：“这一下可找到了治水的好办法，要修就要把水圈住，不要叫它跑掉了”。县委根据群众意见，决定在史各庄洼地修第一座平原水库，并组织了十二个乡的干部和群众，从始至终地参加了这个水库的施工。这些乡的干部和群众，经过实地试验、实地参观，很快学会了修平原水库的技术，认识了它的好处。各乡、社干部回去以后，就按照县的统一规划，周密组织劳力，迅速掀起修建平原水库的高潮。这种作法在开展其他工作中也得到应用。
    县委特别注意了深入群众，发现先进典型，组织干部参观，由点向面推广。推广先进经验的办法，主要是发动组织各乡、社党委书记、社长亲自到实地参观，就地开会，就地讨论，制定本乡本社的规划。这样随参观、随开会、随规划，就能将一个先进经验很快地推广起来，不断地把指导思想建立在先进的基础上，积极地领导群众前进。干部对于这种现场会议很满意，他们说：“到实地一看，就搞通了思想，办法也学的周全。”据统计，三个多月中，曾在本县范围内组织大型参观七次，四千二百多人；组织到保定、安国等外地参观四次，四千二百多人；组织乡社之间的小型参观三百五十多次，达一万六千多人。通过参观，学习了先进经验，克服了保守思想，鼓舞了革命干劲。
    推广先进经验的范围，是因地制宜的。适用于大范围的在大范围内推广，适用于小范围的在小范围内推广，并把别人的先进经验和本地的具体情况相结合，创造性地加以运用。有力出力，有计献计
    县委根据“三主”方针和治理漭河的经验，研究本县治水规划时，抛开了过去几年来依赖国家搞大型工程的思想，决定要在一个冬季大搞、快搞、多搞水利工程。这就需要解决人力、物力和技术等方面的一系列问题，并且明确了这些问题只有依靠群众和发动群众来解决，才能做到多、快、好、省。县委深知徐水广大人民对消灭旱、涝灾害，实现水利化有极为迫切的要求，只要治水方针正确，方法对头，并为群众所掌握，就会成为巨大的物质力量。因此，他们没有被那些所谓“开渠浇地，就要碱化，不能增产，劳民伤财”等等反对兴修水利的错误言论所动摇。坚定地按照上级指示和自己的规划，发动起大规模的水利建设运动。县委提出了“山区、平原、洼地一齐治，防洪、防旱、防涝结合搞”以后，很快形成水利建设高潮。在修建各项水利工程中，充分体现了依靠群众办水利、勤俭办水利的精神。建成的二百零八座水库，基本上是群众自办的，而且花钱很少。大王店村群众八昼夜修成了一座蓄水二十五万方，浇地二千五百亩的水库，命名“聚宝盆”水库，只用款二十九元四角三分。乡政府只花一角钱，作了几朵大红花奖给劳动模范。只有正在施工的瀑河中型水库，由国家补助一百万元。
    全面开花，到处搞水利，各乡都需要技术人员，而全县只有几个人会算水账，技术力量不足成了当时的严重问题。解决的办法也只有一条：依靠群众。县委对干部和群众提出了：“边学、边建、边指挥，边练、边战、边提高”。组织技术组巡回指导，边施工边学习，边学边应用，开展了群众性的学习技术运动。全县有一百二十四名干部学会了修水库，许多群众也学会了修水库。技术为群众所掌握，就不是什么神秘难懂的东西了。何庄群众本着“水向东流”的道理，用绳子量着开了浇地一千五百亩的渠，刘祥店群众用盖房的水平尺和大盆放上水当水平仪，测量地形。于庄渠道长达一百四十华里，从勘测、设计到施工，都是群众自己搞的，结果是又快又好。
    要修许多工程量较大的中型水库，需要劳力很多，如果按过去的办法，限于某一项工程受益的村才出劳力，就不行了。群众在有力出力、有计献计的号召下，经过辩论，算清了大账，认识到全县全部工程总算起来，大家都有利。这种社会主义的精神——为群众所接受，大家便积极参加了由县统一调配劳力的水利工程。
    在群众的积极性发动起来以后，潜力是无穷无尽的。南隆善乡打井无麻，有钱买不到，发动社员讨论，各户共拿出好麻一千二百五十斤，麻绳六百五十条。为了解决水利物资（打井器材等），经过发动群众，在很短的时间内，总计干部、群众在自愿的原则下投资六百六十五万元。有的自愿把分红和准备盖房的钱投了资，认为“现在好坏有房住，水利搞不好不行”。有的还自愿地把多年未露面的宝藏也拿出来投资搞生产。
    在发动群众投工、投资搞水利运动中，有三个值得注意的问题：首先是动员人力必须注意到农村生产的需要，县委的原则，是“小忙大干，大忙小干，不忙突击”；其次是动员投资必须坚持自愿原则，在运动中曾经发生过“挤投资”的现象，县委随时作了纠正；再次是群众吃粮和用钱问题，县委专门划分出一条副业生产、粮食工作战线，由一名县委书记“挂帅”，采取有效措施，切实解决群众的生活问题。
    光荣台前比英雄
    这县领导生产大跃进运动，是一个高潮紧接着一个高潮。这一个高潮连接那一个高潮的枢纽，主要是县、乡召开评比竞赛大会。有的乡在这个大会上还设有若干光荣台，把各个社、队在运动中得的奖旗、奖状等，陈列在各自的光荣台上来比较。南张丰等乡把这种评比竞赛大会称之为“光荣台前比英雄”。评比竞赛大会的内容，主要是总结上一个高潮的工作，布置下一个高潮的任务；评比模范，发起竞赛。
    在每一个运动中，都存在着先进、中间、落后三种人。这三种人并不是固定的，在这一运动这一时期是落后的，在另一个运动另一个时期可能赶上先进。同样，先进的也可能变为落后。徐水县委了解到这一规律，紧紧抓住了先进与落后两个对立面，普遍开展了竞赛评比运动，有力地推动了生产大跃进运动的发展。因为进行评比，是抓两头带中间的领导方法的具体运用，是把先进单位的或个人的优点与落后单位或个人的弱点放在一起，用活生生的事实说服人们，落后单位就容易解决思想问题，急起直追，中间单位也容易鼓起干劲，努力赶先进。这一方面因为他们看到了自己的弱点，提高了觉悟；另一方面是因为看到先进单位的活样子，接受了先进单位的经验，干起来有办法，有信心。徐水县在评比运动中，恰当地运用了领导和群众相结合的群众路线的方法，有时候是由领导调查了解，提出名单，在群众中酝酿比较以后确定；有时候是由群众酝酿提名，讨论比较，然后领导审查确定。另一个比较经常性的表扬批评形式，是不论群众或干部，对某个单位或某个人，常常用大字报进行表扬或批评。这样作，先进的不脱离群众，落后的也受到了群众的教育督促。
    对表扬的单位和个人，不是要求他在任何运动中或任何事情上都是十全十美的，而是在某一段时间某一项工作中有了比较突出的成绩，就给以适当的表扬。对落后的不是固定的看法，不只注意了不要讽刺、打击他们，还要抓住他们在工作中某一点上有成绩，及时予以表扬，或有意识的帮助他在某一点上搞出成绩，鼓舞起干劲，引导他赶先进。这样作，在每一个运动中就能涌现出大批的先进单位和先进人物，同时又能使先进的不骄傲，落后的不气馁。
    在去冬水利建设高潮中，全县进行了两次评比。今年3月初，又进行了水利积肥评比，同时发动开展了小麦管理、春耕播种、技术改革运动。这样把竞赛评比根据工作阶段贯彻经常，就是一个运动紧接着一个运动，一个高潮紧接着推向另一个高潮。
