Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd - According to TASS, President Nasser of the United Arab Republic, in his reply to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev, expressed his support for the Soviet decision to halt nuclear weapons testing. Nasser's letter was a response to Khrushchev's letter concerning the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing.

Nasser's reply stated that the government of the United Arab Republic believes that continuing to test such weapons would pose a great danger to people's health, and therefore advocates that it is necessary to prohibit the manufacture and testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The reply further stated, "The people of the United Arab Republic absolutely cannot be indifferent to this danger, because there was recent news that some countries intend to test atomic weapons in Africa. This forces us to more resolutely adhere to our principles and pay more attention to the resolutions made by the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference on this issue."

    纳赛尔支持苏联建议
    据新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科23日讯：阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔在给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的复信中，表示支持苏联停止核武器试验的决定。纳赛尔的信是对赫鲁晓夫的关于苏联决定单方面停止核武器试验的信的复信。
    纳赛尔的复信说，阿拉伯联合共和国政府认为，继续试验这种武器将给人们的健康带来很大的危害，因此主张必需禁止制造和试验原子武器和氢武器。
    复信说，“阿拉伯联合共和国人民对这种危险绝对不能漠不关心，因为不久前有消息说，某些国家打算在非洲试验原子武器。这就使我们不得不更加坚决地坚持我们的原则，更加注意亚非人民团结大会就这个问题所作出的决议。”
