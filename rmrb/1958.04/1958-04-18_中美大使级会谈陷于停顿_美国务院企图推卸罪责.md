Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 17th: After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on April 12th, explaining how the United States used rogue tactics to delay and obstruct the Sino-American ambassadorial talks, causing them to be stalled for a long period, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 14th, trying its best to shirk responsibility.

The U.S. State Department dares not answer directly the solemn condemnation of the Chinese government. The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement pointed out that the U.S. has been employing delaying tactics for four months, attempting to lower the level of the talks, rendering them completely ineffective. This shows that the U.S. government is neither willing to openly break off the Sino-American talks in the face of world opinion, nor is it willing to genuinely reach an agreement to ease the situation. The U.S. State Department's statement is silent on this fundamental obstacle standing in the way of the Sino-American talks.

The State Department's statement could not provide any clear reason to defend itself for violating the Sino-American agreement, appointing Martin, who did not have ambassadorial status, as the representative to the talks, and delaying the appointment of an ambassador-level representative, which led to the long-term interruption of the Sino-American talks. At the same time, it tried its best to tout Martin's personal qualifications, saying that he "is a veteran career diplomat with seventeen years of experience." The statement insisted on continuing to have Martin represent the U.S. side in the talks, but given the obviously unreasonable situation of the U.S. authorities, it had to state that "the U.S. government is prepared to designate an ambassador to serve as the U.S. representative as quickly as possible."

The U.S. statement also repeated old tunes, attempting to shift the responsibility for delaying the negotiations onto China. It once again raised the issue of China's continued detention of six American criminals, attempting to equate the issue of handling American criminals, which falls within the scope of Chinese law and sovereignty, with the issue of the return of civilians from both sides, taking the opportunity to slander China. The statement also attacked China for refusing to declare "renunciation of the use of force in the Taiwan region," which prevented the Sino-American talks from making progress. In fact, this U.S. approach of forcing China to recognize the status quo of the U.S. occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan and abandoning the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan can only expose the U.S.'s aggressive stance and unwillingness to reach a positive agreement in the Sino-American talks time and time again.

### 中美大使级会谈陷于停顿  美国务院企图推卸罪责

    中美大使级会谈陷于停顿
    美国务院企图推卸罪责
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：中华人民共和国外交部4月12日发表声明，说明了美国使用无赖手法进行拖延和阻挠、使中美大使级会谈长期陷于停顿的经过以后，美国国务院在14日发表了声明，竭力企图推卸责任。
    美国国务院不敢正面回答中国政府的严正谴责。中国外交部声明曾经指出，四个月来美国玩弄拖延手法，企图降低谈判级别，使会谈根本失去作用，这说明了美国政府既不敢在世界舆论面前公然破裂中美会谈，又不愿真正达成协议使形势得到和缓。美国国务院的声明对于横亘在中美会谈道路上的这一基本障碍，默不作声。
    国务院声明对于美国违反中美双方协议，委派不具有大使身份的马丁充任会谈代表并且拖延委派大使级的代表致使中美会谈长期中断这件事，提不出任何明确的理由来替自己辩解，同时却竭力吹嘘马丁的个人资历，说他“是一个具有十七年经验的老资格的职业外交官”。声明坚持继续要马丁代表美方出面会谈，但是鉴于美国当局显然无理的处境，又不得不表示，“美国政府准备尽可能快地指定一位大使来担任美国代表”。
    美国的声明还重弹老调，企图把拖延谈判的责任推到中国身上，它再一次提出中国继续拘留六名美国罪犯的问题，企图把属于中国法律和主权范围以内的处理美国罪犯问题同中美双方平民回国问题混为一谈，乘机对中国进行诬蔑。声明还攻击中国拒绝宣布“放弃在台湾地区使用武力”，使中美会谈未能取得进展。而事实上，美方这种硬要中国承认美国霸占中国领土台湾的现状、放弃对台湾行使主权的作法，只能一次又一次地暴露美国的侵略立场和无意于使中美会谈达成积极的协议。
