(Liaoning, Chaoyang, collected by Song Ruilin)

The river flows swiftly, the Jiang flows slowly, but we decide. We tell the water to go, and it goes! We tell it to stop, and it stops. We tell it to rise and it doesn't dare to fall. We tell it to generate electricity, and it generates electricity.

(Sichuan, Shifang, collected by Chen Xiao)

Mountains must be adorned, water must irrigate fields, soil must be utilized, land must yield high production. Difficulties are a scale, testing your strength. If you are strong, they are weak; if you are weak, they are strong.

    我们说了算河水急，江水慢，还得我们说了算，叫水走，水就走！叫水站，水就站，叫它高来不敢低，叫它发电就发电。
          （辽宁朝阳，宋瑞麟搜集）是山，都要打扮，是水，都要灌田，是土，都要利用，是地，都要高产。困难是杆秤，看你硬不硬，你硬它就软，你软它就硬。
          （四川什邡，陈宵搜集）
