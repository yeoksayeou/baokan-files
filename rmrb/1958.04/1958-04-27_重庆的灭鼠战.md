    Chongqing's rats are famous for being numerous, large, and ferocious. They are not afraid of people, and even not afraid of cats.
    In such an area, it takes time to eliminate rat infestation. However, the people of Chongqing believe that time only benefits the rats. Rats reproduce extremely quickly. If you eliminate them in stages, they will replenish themselves in stages, and it will become a race between elimination and reproduction. Therefore, a complete victory must be achieved in one battle. Rats are distributed in sewers, houses, and fields. Although they each have their own "defense zone," they also interact with each other, so simultaneous attacks are necessary to prevent them from escaping. Therefore, the rat's food supply was strictly cut off first, then sulfur was used to fumigate the sewers, poison baits and rat traps were placed everywhere on the ground, holes were dug and searched, everyone took action, and smoke billowed everywhere. After twenty-four days and nights of continuous combat (some areas did not take this long), a huge victory of eliminating more than 5.9 million rats was achieved. The search for remnants is still underway, and it is estimated that the number has reached 6 million. It is said that the largest rat weighed seven catties. A comrade from the municipal government said that he saw one that weighed two catties and a dozen taels, which was already like a cat, but it cannot be ruled out that there were even larger ones.
    It reminds me of a poem about a large rat in the Book of Songs:
      Big rat, oh big rat,
      Don't eat my millet!
      For years I have indulged you,
      But you don't care about me at all.
      I have no choice but to leave you,
      And go to a place without rats.
      A place without rats,
      Is where I can settle down.
    〔Original〕碩鼠碩鼠，無食我黍！三歲貫女，莫我肯顧。逝將去女，適彼樂土。樂土樂土，爰得我所。

    Probably in primitive society, before the emergence of exploiting classes, rats and sparrows survived and developed by plundering the fruits of the people's labor as exploiters. People's hatred for them is often referred to as sparrows and rats together, as the Book of Songs says: "Who says the sparrow has no horns? How can it penetrate my house? Who says the rat has no teeth? How can it penetrate my walls?" etc., and rats are especially bad. Rats "hide during the day and move at night," taking advantage of people's unpreparedness. They steal everything and bite everything. Even small children are bitten. Moreover, rats also spread the most vicious disease to humans – the plague. Traditional methods of controlling rats: one is to raise cats, the other is to use smoke, poison, and block holes. With so many rats in Chongqing, cats are powerless. People have been using the cat's ability to catch rats for who knows how many years, but the rat infestation remains the same. People knew about "covering holes and smoking out rats" (note) a long time ago, but when people did not cooperate and there was no unified command, they blocked here and dug there; they smoked here and escaped there. Although rat poison is effective, rats are very cunning. Once they eat it, they warn each other not to eat it again. Sometimes, even if poison is put out for the first time, the rats will not eat it. Farmers say: "You can't talk about putting out rat poison, if you talk about it, the rats will hear it and won't come to eat it."
    Times have changed, and the people are in charge of their own destiny. For rats, it is not "leaving you" but eliminating them, not "indulging you for years" but encircling and annihilating them. It is not just relying on cats to bite, but everyone taking action. This is another great liberation battle after the great victory of the people's revolution.
    Chongqing's rat extermination experience is worth learning. Other regions have sent people to learn from it, and each region will create more and better experiences. Our country will soon become a country without rats.
      〔Note〕"Covering holes and smoking out rats" is found in the Book of Songs, Bin Feng. 穹 is a hole, 窒 is blocking.

    重庆的灭鼠战
    谢觉哉
    重庆的老鼠，是出名的多、出名的大、也出名的凶，它不怕人，甚至不怕猫。
    在这样的地区消灭鼠害，是需要时间的。但重庆人民认为时间只有利于老鼠。老鼠繁殖力特强，分期去消灭它，它也分期来补充，将成为消灭与繁殖竞赛。所以必须一战而获取全胜。鼠的分布地区，有下水道的鼠，房屋里的鼠，田野里的鼠，它们虽各有“防区”，但也互相来往，所以又必须同时进攻，使其无处逃匿。于是先严断鼠的粮道，随即向下水道用硫磺熏，地面上到处置毒鼠药和打鼠机、掘洞搜捕、人人动手、处处冒烟，一连作战二十四昼夜（有的地区没这样久），获得消灭老鼠五百九十多万只的巨大战果，现还在搜捕余孽，估计已达六百万只。传说最大的鼠有七斤重，市府同志说，他看到有二斤十几两的，已是像猫一样，但也不能断言没有比这更大的。
    想起了诗经上一首大老鼠的诗：
      大老鼠呀大老鼠，
      你不要吃我的黍！
      几年来我纵容了你，
      你一点也不顾及我。
      我只好离开你，
      走到没有老鼠的地方去。
      没有老鼠的地方，
      才是我的安身之所。
    〔原文〕硕鼠硕鼠，无食我黍！三岁贯女，莫我肯顾。逝将去女，适彼乐土。乐土乐土，爰得我所。）
    大概在原始社会尚未出现剥削阶级的时候，老鼠和麻雀就以剥削者姿态抢夺人民的劳动果实而生存而发展的。人们对它们的仇恨常是雀鼠并称，如诗经上说的：“谁谓雀无角，何以穿我屋；谁谓鼠无牙，何以穿我墉”等，而鼠为尤甚。鼠“昼伏夜动”乘人不备。甚么都偷，甚么都咬。甚至小孩子都被咬伤。而且老鼠还给人类传播最凶恶的疾病——鼠疫。传统的治鼠方法：一是养猫，二是烟熏、药毒、堵穴。像重庆那样多鼠，猫是无能为力的。人们利用猫能捕鼠的性能，不知道有多少年了，但鼠患仍然如故。很古的时候人们就知道“穹窒熏鼠”（注），但在人们还没有合作，没有统一指挥的时候，这里堵，那里掘；这里熏，那里逃。毒鼠药虽有效，但老鼠鬼得很，吃一次就相戒不来吃了，有时就第一次置毒，鼠也不吃。农民说：“放毒鼠药不能讲，讲就被鼠听到，不来吃了。”
    时代不同了，人民掌管了自己的命运。对于老鼠，不是“逝将去汝”而是把它消灭，不是“三岁贯汝”而是对它围歼。不是只靠猫咬，而是人人动手，这是人民革命伟大胜利后又一次伟大的解放战斗。
    重庆的歼鼠经验值得学习，已引起别的地区派人去学习，各地区也会创造出更多更好的经验。我国将很快就成为无鼠之国。
      〔注〕“穹窒熏鼠”见诗经豳风。穹是穴、窒是堵塞。
