    Concrete Measures - Guaranteeing Leap Forward Targets
    Cadres of the Ministry of Foreign Trade Have Direction and Methods, Morale is High
    (Our report) The Ministry of Foreign Trade has learned that "It is not enough to be satisfied with the plans and targets of the Great Leap Forward; we must formulate practical and feasible concrete measures in a timely manner to ensure that the plans and targets are implemented."
    Based on the movement against waste and conservatism, and after a great debate, the Ministry of Foreign Trade formulated the Great Leap Forward targets for 1958. These targets greatly boosted the enthusiasm of all cadres. However, because the measures were not specific or nonexistent, many people felt "vaguely at a loss" when they thought about how to achieve these targets. They said, "The vision is beautiful, but the road is vague." In response to this situation, the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Trade promptly launched a great debate on formulating measures to achieve the Leap Forward targets. Now, eighteen of the more than thirty units have formulated measures, and the enthusiasm of the masses is even higher and more solid. They no longer feel "lost" and say, "We not only have direction but also methods," "With a little more effort and sweat, we can guarantee 100% achievement of the targets."
    The first characteristic of the Ministry of Foreign Trade in formulating measures is: continuing unremitting struggle against conservative thinking. Many units found the following situation when they began to formulate measures: Some people applauded the overall Leap Forward targets, but when they came into contact with specific issues, that is, what specific methods to take to achieve these targets, they hesitated, always feeling that there were many difficulties and it was not very reliable. For example, the China National Import and Export Corporation had a very low settlement rate for foreign claims in the past, which affected capital turnover. One of the Leap Forward targets this time was to vigorously increase the settlement rate for claims. When debating specific measures, someone mentioned: If the goods are damaged in transit, a claim should be made to the relevant transportation departments; some comrades said: "This is mainly a matter for the railway and shipping sectors. They will drag their feet and shirk responsibility, and we have no way to deal with it." One of the targets of the tobacco and hemp department of the China National Native Produce Export Corporation was to improve the quantity and quality of flue-cured tobacco exports. During the debate on specific measures, when specifically analyzing the favorable and unfavorable factors in various aspects, some comrades almost wanted to "retreat," saying that "re-curing will be too late!" "Transportation conditions are not good!" The conclusion was that this target would be difficult to achieve. When some units discussed specific measures on how to strengthen foreign promotion work, some people said, "Whether or not to buy something is a matter for foreigners, how can we force them to do it?"
    After discovering these ideological situations, the leaders of the ministry immediately instructed the subordinate units to use the method of presenting facts, reasoning, and launching debates to continue to overcome conservative thinking. As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Trade immediately launched a major debate on the issue of measures, and through the debate, conservative thinking was deeply and repeatedly criticized. As mentioned earlier, after debating whether re-curing could be done in time and whether transportation conditions could be improved, the specific measures to improve the quantity and quality of flue-cured tobacco exports were formulated.
    Another characteristic of the Ministry of Foreign Trade in formulating measures is: doing a good job of investigation and research beforehand. In order to make the measures practical and feasible, the leading comrades of many units went to the grassroots level, to the front line, or held a series of meetings to conduct investigation and research. For example, when the China National Import and Export Corporation formulated measures, the responsible cadres first went to factories and ports, and at the same time held symposiums with supply departments to understand the source of goods and assist the supply departments to improve variety and quality, and improve packaging specifications, and then formulated specific promotion plans. Before formulating measures, the textile machinery department of the import department of the China National Transportation Machinery Import Corporation sent people to relevant units to contact, carefully check the information, and then formulated fourteen specific measures.
    Because the Ministry of Foreign Trade paid attention to grasping the above two characteristics in formulating measures, the measures formulated were very detailed and specific. For example, the specific measures of China National Machinery Import Corporation on strengthening political and ideological work not only proposed the method of "carrying out competitions, comparing efforts, timely rewards, and annual evaluation," but also specifically proposed: holding regular ideological meetings for cadres above the director level; holding life review meetings once a month in each department; restoring democratic self-examinations at the end of each quarter; the manager receiving the masses every Saturday afternoon, taking the initiative to talk to people and listen to opinions instead of waiting for people to come to the door, and other specific methods. In terms of improving leadership methods, they not only proposed measures for carrying out "experimental fields" and going to the grassroots level, but also proposed: strengthening business and foreign language learning. Foreign language learning requires mastering more than 1,000 words within two years, being able to read general documents with the help of a dictionary, and being able to conduct simple conversations within three to five years; diligently summarizing work, each department should make a summary of one or two issues every month, mobilize the masses, conduct debates, draw several lessons and put forward future practices and other specific measures.

### 具体措施——跃进指标的保证  外贸部干部有了奔头，又有了道道，情绪高涨

    具体措施——跃进指标的保证
    外贸部干部有了奔头，又有了道道，情绪高涨
    本报讯　“不能满足于跃进的规划、指标，要及时制订切实可行的具体措施，才能保证规划、指标付诸实施。”这是对外贸易部最近在制订措施中的一个体会。
    外贸部在这次反浪费、反保守运动的基础上，经过了大辩论，订出了1958年的跃进指标，这个指标大大鼓舞了全体干部的积极性。但是，因为措施不具体，或没有措施，许多人一想到如何实现这个指标，却又感到“茫茫然不知所措”。他们说：“远景是美丽的，道路却是渺茫的。”外贸部领导上针对这一情况，及时发动大家展开了制订实现跃进指标的措施的大辩论。现在，在所属三十多个单位中，已经有十八个单位订出了措施，群众的热情更加高涨，更加巩固，不再感到“茫然”了，说：“不仅有了奔头，还有了道道”，“加点油，出点汗，保证百分之百地实现指标”。
    外贸部在制订措施中的第一个特点是：继续不懈地同保守思想作斗争。许多单位在开始订措施时，发现这样一个情况：有些人对于总的跃进指标拍手赞成，但是，一接触到具体问题，即究竟采取那些具体办法来达到这个指标，却又犹豫起来，总觉得各方面的困难因素重重，不大保险。比如中国进出口公司过去每年向外索赔结案率很低，影响资金周转，这次跃进指标中，有一条就是大力提高索赔结案率。在辩论具体措施时，有人提到：如果货物在途中受到损失，就应该向有关交通部门索赔；部分同志就说：“这主要是铁路和航运方面的事，他们要拖拉、扯皮，我们没有办法。”中国土产出口公司烟麻处有一条指标是提高烤烟出口的数量和质量，这个处在辩论具体措施当中，具体分析各方面有利因素和不利因素的时候，有个别同志几乎要打“退堂鼓”，说是“复烤来不及呀！”“运输条件不行呀！”结论是这个指标很难实现。还有些单位在讨论如何加强对外推销工作的具体措施时，有人说：“买不买东西是外国人的事，我们怎能强迫人家做？”
    这个部的领导上在发现这些思想情况后，立即指示所属单位用摆事实、说道理、展开辩论的办法，继续克服保守思想。于是，外贸部立即掀起了一个关于措施问题的大辩论，经过辩论，深入地、反复地批判了保守思想。前面说到的中国土产出口公司在辩论了究竟复烤能不能来得及？运输条件究竟能不能改善的问题以后，提高烤烟出口数量和质量的具体措施就订出来了。
    外贸部在制订措施当中的另一特点是：事前做好调查研究工作。为了使措施切实可行，许多单位的领导同志下基层，下现场，或召开一系列的会议，进行调查研究工作。比如中国进出口公司在制订措施时，负责干部先下工厂，下口岸，同时召开供货部门座谈会，摸清货源情况，并协助供货部门提高品种质量，改进包装规格，然后，再订出推销的具体方案。运输机械进口公司出口处纺织机械处在订措施前，派人到有关单位联系，仔细查对资料，然后订出了十四条具体措施。
    由于对外贸易部在订措施当中，注意掌握了以上两个特点，订出来的措施，内容非常详尽、具体。如中国机械进口公司关于加强政治思想工作的具体措施，不仅提出了“开展竞赛，互比干劲，及时奖励，年终评比”的办法，还具体提出：定期召开处长以上干部思想见面会；每处每月开生活检讨会一次；恢复每季末民主大检查；经理每星期六下午接见群众，不等人上门，主动找人谈话，听取意见等等具体办法。在改进领导方法方面，他们不仅提出搞“试验田”、下基层等方面的措施，还提出：加强业务与外文学习。外文学习要求在二年内，掌握一千个以上的单字，能借助字典阅读一般文件，三年到五年内能够进行简单的会话；勤总结工作，每处每月应就一两个问题作出小结，发动群众，进行辩论，得出几条经验教训，提出今后作法等等具体措施。
