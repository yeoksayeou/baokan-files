Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 2nd – One hundred and thirteen field exploration teams, composed of more than five thousand petroleum geological exploration workers, set off from Urumqi a month ahead of schedule, advancing into the Gobi and deserts north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. This year, they will explore thirteen oil-bearing structures suitable for drilling for the country.

This year's exploration work will focus on the Junggar Basin, which has the most promising oil prospects. In the Tarim Basin, more than twenty exploration teams will conduct detailed surveys of the Kuqa Basin, which has great potential for oil, and search for new oil-bearing structures in the Tarim Desert and the southwestern part of the basin.

This year's petroleum geological exploration work in Xinjiang is the largest in history. The workload of various types of exploration has more than doubled compared to last year without increasing personnel, and the country will also save 4 million yuan in exploration costs for the whole year. In order to ensure the completion of this year's exploration tasks, the petroleum geological exploration personnel of the one hundred and thirteen teams all proposed before departure: this year in the field, they will go out to work early, return late, and not be idle, return, or stop work; run fast, write fast, and move quickly in the field; seize windy days and rainy days. At the same time, they decided to extend this year's field work period from the past seven months to eight months. Transportation, repair, and equipment supply units serving the exploration work also took the initiative to propose cooperation guarantees to the field teams.

    向沙漠要石油
    一百多个勘探队进军天山南北
    新华社乌鲁木齐2日电　由五千多名石油地质勘探工作者组成的一百一十三个野外勘探队提前一月从乌鲁木齐出发，向天山南北的戈壁和沙漠进军。今年他们要为国家勘探出十三个可以钻探的储油构造。
    今年勘探工作的重点是在最有含油远景的准噶尔盆地。在塔里木盆地今年有二十多个勘探队详查含油远景很大的库车盆地，并且在塔里木大沙漠及盆地西南部找寻新的储油构造。
    今年新疆石油地质勘探工作量是历年来最大的一年。各样工种的勘探工作量在没有增加人员的情况下，都比去年增加一倍以上，全年还要为国家节约勘探费用四百万元，为了保证完成今年的勘探任务，一百一十三个队的石油地质勘探人员，在出发前都提出：今年在野外要作到早出工、晚收工、不窝不返不停工；跑得快、写得快，野外搬家搬得快；抢风天、抓雨天。同时，他们确定要把今年的野外工作期限由已往七个月延长到八个月。为勘探工作服务的运输、修理、器材供应等单位，也都主动向野外队提出配合保证。
