Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 21st. Liu Lianren held a press conference today at the Shandong Hotel, exposing and denouncing the despicable and shameless attempts of the Kishi Nobusuke government and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents to entice and deceive him before his return to China.

Liu Lianren said, "Before I returned to China, not only did the Kishi Nobusuke government send people to give me money in an attempt to buy me off, but a scoundrel also tried to trick me into going to Taiwan. But I saw through their scheme!"

Liu Lianren said, "I arrived in Tokyo on March 26th. Soon after arriving in Tokyo, one day, I went out and returned to my residence. The owner of the residence told me that an old fellow townsman of mine had come to see me, bringing a package of snacks and leaving a business card, asking me to wait for him at home in the evening, saying he would definitely come at eight o'clock. I was very happy to hear that; at that time, hearing the words 'fellow townsman' felt very intimate!"

"Around eight o'clock, he indeed came. The man nodded and bowed upon meeting me, smiling and saying, 'Hello, fellow townsman! You've had a hard time! I read in the newspaper about your suffering in the mountains, it's truly heartbreaking.' I looked him over and over but didn't recognize him. Besides, I don't know why, but I felt that his enthusiasm didn't seem quite right. I asked him his surname, where his hometown was, and what he was doing now. He said his surname was Wang (I forgot his given name), that he was from Penglai County, Shandong Province, and that he was working for the Overseas Chinese Association. I had pressed oil in Penglai for many years, and I was familiar with almost all the places there. Then I asked him which township in Penglai he lived in. He said Xixiang (West Township). I asked him how far it was from the city. He said sixty li. He let it slip there. I immediately followed up with a question: 'Sixty li west of Penglai County, wouldn't that be Huang County?' The guy wasn't prepared for that, and I caught him off guard with the question. He had to stammer and say that he had been away from home for a long time and couldn't remember clearly."

Liu Lianren imitated the awkward state of the secret agent at the time, and continued, "That guy sneaked close to me and said, 'You don't have to go home, I'll find you a place to work here.' I said no, I can't read. He said, 'You can do business.' I said no, I miss home, even if you give me tens of thousands, I can't stay here."

"He saw that I was determined not to stay in Japan, and his expression changed somewhat. He glanced outside and quietly said, 'Okay, if you want to return to China, I'll send you back, our government is in Taiwan.' As soon as I heard that, I knew he was a scoundrel."

Liu Lianren finally said angrily, "I've already fully experienced the tastes of Japanese devils and Chiang Kai-shek, I finally crawled out of the pit of fire, but they want to drag me down again, they are blind!" He expressed his resolute protest against the shameless conspiracy carried out against him by the Kishi Nobusuke government and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents.

    刘连仁在济南举行记者招待会
    揭露国民党特务的拉拢和欺骗
    据新华社济南21日电　刘连仁今天在山东宾馆举行记者招待会，揭露和痛斥岸信介政府和蒋介石特务分子在他回国之前对他进行卑劣无耻的拉拢和欺骗。
    刘连仁说：“在我回国之前，不光是岸信介政府派人给我送钱，企图收买我；而且还曾有一个坏蛋企图把我骗到台湾去。可是我识破了他们的主意！”
    刘连仁说：“我是3月26日到东京的。到东京后不久，有一天，我出去后回到寓所，寓所主人告诉我，有我的一个老乡来看过我，带着一包点心，还留着一张名片，叫我晚上在家等他，八点钟他还一定来。我听了很高兴，在那个时候听到‘老乡’两个字够多亲啊！”
      “约莫八点钟的时候，果然来了。那人见面就点头躬腰，笑嘻嘻地说：‘老乡你好！辛苦了！我从报纸上看到你在深山受苦的事真叫人辛酸’。我看来看去并不认识他；再说，不知怎么回事，我老觉得他那股热情好像不大对劲。我就问他贵姓，老家是那里？现在做什么。他说他姓王（名字忘了），是山东省蓬莱县人，现在华侨会工作。我曾在蓬莱榨了好多年油，那里的地方我差不多都熟悉。接着我又问他住蓬莱那乡？他说西乡。我又问他离城多近，他说六十里。这下子他可说露了。我紧跟上追问了一句：“蓬莱县以西六十里，不早就到了黄县去了吗？”那家伙没防备这一着，一下子叫我问住了，只好吞吞吐吐地说他离家已久，记不清楚了。”
    刘连仁模仿了一下这个特务分子当时手足无措的窘迫状态，接着说：“那家伙鬼头鬼脑地凑近身边对我说：你不必家去，留在这里我给你找个地方做事。我说不行，我不识字。他说：可以做买卖。我说不行，我想家，就是给我万上加万的钱我也不能留在这里。
    “他看我坚决不肯留在日本，脸色就有些变了。他向外张望了一下悄悄地说：好吧，你想回国就送你回国，咱们的政府在台湾。我一听心里就全明白他是一个坏蛋了。
    刘连仁最后气愤地说：“日本鬼子、蒋介石的滋味我早就吃透了，我好不容易从火坑里爬出来，他们却又想把我拖下去，他们是瞎了眼睛！”他表示坚决抗议岸信介政府和蒋介石特务分对于他进行的无耻阴谋。
