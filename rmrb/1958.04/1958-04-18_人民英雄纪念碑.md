    Monument to the People's Heroes
    The Monument to the People's Heroes has been erected in Tiananmen Square. It symbolizes the great achievements of the revolutionary martyrs and is a landmark for the people of the whole country to commemorate them.
    On September 30, 1949, on the eve of the founding of New China, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference passed a resolution to erect a monument to the revolutionary martyrs. At 6 p.m. that day, Chairman Mao led all the members in a solemn and grand groundbreaking ceremony for the monument in Tiananmen Square.
    The monument stands between Tiananmen and Zhengyangmen, and is 37.94 meters from the ground to the top, 4.24 meters higher than Tiananmen, making it solemn, lofty, and majestic. The monument's core stone is engraved with eight gilded characters inscribed by Chairman Mao: "The People's Heroes Are Immortal." The back of the monument has gilded characters of the inscription written by Premier Zhou. Around the lower Sumeru pedestal below the monument are ten historical reliefs, recounting the revolutionary martyrs' heroic and moving history of struggle.
    The monument is surrounded by lawns. The platform has wide steps and walkways on all four sides. South of the monument to the Gate of China is a lush pine forest, and to the north is a flat square. The monument faces Tiananmen from afar, making Tiananmen Square even more spectacular.

    人民英雄纪念碑
    人民英雄纪念碑，在天安门广场建立起来了。它象征着先烈们的丰功伟迹，它是全国人民怀念先烈的标志。
    在新中国成立的前夕，1949年9月30日，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议，通过为先烈立纪念碑，当天下午六时，毛主席率领全体委员在天安门广场为纪念碑举行了庄严隆重的奠基礼。
    纪念碑矗立在天安门与正阳门之间，从地面到碑顶有三十七点九四公尺，比天安门还高四点二四公尺，庄严、崇高、雄伟。碑心石上刻着毛主席题的“人民英雄永垂不朽”八个镏金大字，碑背面是周总理书写的碑文镏金字。碑身下的下须弥座四周是十块历史浮刻，叙述了先烈们轰轰烈烈的斗争历史。
    纪念碑周围为草坪，月台四面有广阔的台阶和甬道，碑以南至中华门是一片苍翠茂密的松林，以北为平坦的广场。纪念碑与天安门遥遥相对，使得天安门广场更为壮观。
