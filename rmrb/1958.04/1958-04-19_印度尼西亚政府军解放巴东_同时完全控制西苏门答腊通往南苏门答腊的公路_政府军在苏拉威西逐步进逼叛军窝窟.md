Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 18th: Indonesian Army authorities announced today that Indonesian government forces completely recovered Padang, the main port in central West Sumatra seized by the rebel group, at 6:00 PM local time on the 17th.

Padang is one of the two centers seized by the rebel group, located 98 kilometers from Bukittinggi, the seat of the rebel "government."

The communiqué stated that, according to air force reconnaissance, the defeated rebels, carrying weapons, had fled to Indarung, ten kilometers east of Padang. Government air force planes have bombed and strafed this rebel force.

At the same time, Indonesian Army authorities announced that government forces advancing northward from Lubukjambi recovered Takung Hilir and Tanjung Lolo on the 17th, and were advancing towards Sawahlunto. Government forces advancing south from Lubukjambi recovered Sungai Dareh on the 17th. After recovering these locations, government forces completely controlled all highways connecting West Sumatra to South Sumatra.

According to the Indonesian military's announcement of the recapture of Padang, the joint operation by the government's army, navy, and air force began on the morning of the 17th. At 6:40 AM local time, marines, under the cover of naval gunfire, landed at Meurah Nanum, six and a half miles north of Padang, and captured the beachhead there. Simultaneously, paratroopers landed near Tabing Airport. Due to the excellent coordinated combat of the government's army, navy, and air force, only weak resistance was encountered when capturing the beachhead. Subsequently, a large number of army troops safely landed at the beachhead at 8:45 AM.

After landing, the army troops immediately advanced on the rebels in three directions: the first route controlled the northern coastal area of the beachhead and occupied the Cold Water Bridge; the second route advanced towards Tabing Airport to reinforce the paratroopers landing there; the third route advanced towards Padang city.

Government air force and naval bombardment destroyed the rebel stronghold on Monkey Mountain between Padang and Tabing Airport.

At 3:30 PM, government forces captured the GOR H. Agus Salim stadium, and at 6:00 PM, the entire city of Padang was recovered.

It was announced that, to date, government forces have captured twenty rebels and seized a batch of military supplies. Detailed results of the operation are unknown.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 17th: Indonesian military authorities announced that government troops recovered Pakuli, Sumurapariji, and Belarak on the east coast of Central Sulawesi on the 13th. The liberation of these places indicates that government troops are gradually advancing on the rebel nest in North Sulawesi.

News from North Sulawesi said that the economic situation in the Minahasa region (the rebel-controlled center) is very chaotic. The prices of food and daily necessities have soared, with some items costing more than ten times their previous price. The people are eagerly awaiting the arrival of government troops. Military authorities announced that a ship named "Jack Tamimi" fled from Manado, occupied by the rebels, to Makassar on the 16th.

Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: TASS, New York, April 17th: "Chicago Daily News" reporter Beach reported from Singapore that in the past two months, rebels in Central Sumatra have frequently received American weapons and ammunition air-dropped by airplanes of "unidentified nationality." Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, one of the rebel leaders, told this American reporter that he had enough American weapons to equip eight thousand soldiers.

The reporter said that although the rebel leaders loudly proclaimed that they would "fight to the end," the "rebels are still fighting very badly."

    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚陆军当局今天发表公告说，印度尼西亚政府军已经在17日当地时间下午六时完全收复了叛乱集团窃据的西苏门答腊中部主要港口巴东。
    巴东是叛乱集团窃据的两个中心之一，它距叛乱“政府”所在地武吉丁宜九十八公里。
    公报说，据空军侦察，溃退的叛军已经携带武器逃向巴东以东十公里的英达兰。政府空军已经向这股叛军进行了轰炸和用机枪扫射。
    同时，印度尼西亚陆军当局宣布，从鲁务占碑向北继续进军的一路政府军在17日又收复了塔孔希利尔和丹戎洛洛，并且向沙哇伦多挺进。从鲁务占碑向南挺进的政府军在17日收复了双溪达腊。在收复这些地方之后，政府军就完全控制了西苏门答腊通向南苏门答腊的所有公路。
    据印度尼西亚军方宣布收复巴东的经过情形说，政府陆海空军的联合作战行动是在17日清晨开始的。在当地时间上午六时四十分，海军陆战队在军舰炮火的掩护下，在巴东以北六英里半的梅腊恩南姆登陆，攻占了那里的滩头阵地。同时，伞兵部队在塔宾机场附近降落。由于政府军陆海空军卓越地进行了互相配合的战斗，在攻克滩头阵地时只遭到了微弱的抵抗。其后，陆军在八时四十五分大批在滩头安全登陆。
    陆军部队在登陆后立即分三路向叛军进击：第一路控制滩头阵地北部海岸地区并且占领了冷水桥；第二路向塔宾机场进军，增援在那里降落的伞兵部队；第三路向巴东市挺进。
    政府空军和军舰的轰击摧毁了位于巴东和塔宾机场之间的猿猴山的叛军据点。
    下午三时三十分，政府军攻占了雄牛体育场，下午六时收复了整个巴东市。
    据宣布，到目前为止，政府军已经俘虏了二十名叛军和缴获了一批军火。作战的详细结果未悉。
    据新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚军事当局宣布，政府军队13日在中苏拉威西东海岸收复了帕库利、苏穆腊帕里吉和贝拉腊克。这些地方的解放表明政府军队正在逐步进逼北苏拉威西叛军的巢穴。
    来自北苏拉威西的消息说，米那哈沙地区（叛军控制的中心）的经济情况非常混乱。粮食和日用品的价格猛涨，某些物品的价格比以前高十倍以上。人民正在急切地盼望政府军到来。军事当局宣布，有一艘名叫“杰克·塔米米”的轮船16日从叛军占据的万鸦老逃往望加锡。
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社纽约17日讯：“芝加哥每日新闻”记者比奇从新加坡报道，最近两个月来，中苏门答腊叛乱分子经常获得“不明国籍”的飞机空投下来的美国武器和弹药。叛乱分子头目之一沙弗鲁丁对这位美国记者说，他拥有足够装备八千名兵士的美国武器。
    这位记者说，尽管叛军头目大声疾呼要“战斗到底”，但是“叛军仍然打得很糟”。
