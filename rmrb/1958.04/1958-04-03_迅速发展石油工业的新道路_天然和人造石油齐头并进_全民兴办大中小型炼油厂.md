Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd. China's petroleum industry, which has a very weak foundation, has found a new path for rapid development. This new path is to resolutely implement the policy of "natural petroleum and synthetic petroleum advancing simultaneously" put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and to use the methods of "the whole people engaging in petroleum" and "combining large, medium, and small-scale enterprises," so that the petroleum industry, after typical demonstrations, will also see widespread blooming.

According to this path, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has preliminarily calculated an account: It is estimated that by 1962, the national crude oil production can exceed the number of 5 million to 6 million tons of the crude oil planned output proposed by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

In addition to the several natural oil fields and oil regions that have been discovered in China, the resources of synthetic petroleum are also very rich. In addition to the already proven large mines such as Maoming and Fushun, there are nearly a hundred outcrops of oil shale discovered by the Ministry of Geology during geological surveys in twenty-one provinces. Deposits of lignite, bituminous coal, and anthracite are even more abundant everywhere. The natural gas abundant in Sichuan is also a raw material for manufacturing synthetic petroleum. In particular, the enthusiasm of local authorities in running industries is currently very high, and many technical problems in the development of synthetic petroleum have also been basically resolved. Therefore, adopting the method of advancing simultaneously and widespread blooming can quickly increase oil production. According to calculations, if an average prefecture builds a synthetic petroleum plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons, it will only take about one year to build the plant. The 180 prefectures across the country can produce 1.8 million tons of crude oil annually, which is more than the national oil production in 1958.

In order to achieve this goal, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has formulated a series of measures.

First, vigorously support local development of the synthetic petroleum industry. In addition to continuing to step up the construction of several large-scale synthetic petroleum plants such as Maoming and Fushun as typical examples, the ministry is also designing more than 20 different types of medium and small-scale refineries for local authorities. The scale ranges from medium and small-scale plants with an annual output of 2,000 to 50,000 tons of petroleum suitable for provinces, prefectures, and counties to operate, to small plants that can be operated very easily by districts and townships below the county level. The products are mainly heavy diesel oil that can be used for irrigation and drainage machinery, and can also be processed into first-class gasoline, kerosene, and light diesel oil. When using coal as a raw material, a large amount of semi-coke can also be produced, which can be used for household fuel, gas engines, and the manufacture of chemical fertilizers. At present, ten provinces including Shanxi and Jiangxi have contacted the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and are preparing to adopt these designs for construction. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry has also dispatched three working groups to the Northeast, East China, Northwest, and Southwest to investigate resource conditions. At the same time, it is preparing to build a set of demonstration projects this year in order to gain experience and then help various places with construction.

Secondly, accelerate the geological exploration of natural petroleum and the development of oil fields, so as to both focus on developing large oil fields and make full use of small oil resources. According to recently proven data, the area of the Karamay Oilfield has expanded several times compared to the area investigated last year, and development is continuing to be stepped up. The fact that several exploratory wells in the central Sichuan oil area have recently gushed out a large amount of crude oil provides favorable conditions for the rapid development of the petroleum industry. Due to convenient transportation and easy mining, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has deployed nearly 100 exploratory wells there, preparing to explore and develop this oil area as soon as possible. In addition to continuing to develop the original Laojunmiao Oilfield, the Yumen Oil Mine also plans to accelerate the exploration and development of nearby oil fields such as Ya'erxia and Baiyanghe. This year, the ministry will also carry out a large amount of geological exploration work in five exploration areas, and the footage of petroleum drilling will be greatly increased compared to the original plan.

In addition, the ministry has recently studied the utilization of natural gas. One way is to process natural gas into petroleum by synthesis, and the other is to use natural gas as a raw material for chemical fertilizers and other chemical products, or directly supply it to factories and residents in nearby cities as fuel or to replace gasoline for cars. This year, a synthetic oil plant will be built near the Huangguashan gas field in Sichuan.

At present, this path for the rapid development of the petroleum industry has been supported by the vast number of employees in the petroleum industry system. Employees in many units have proposed to complete five years of work in two or three years, and have firmly stated that they will implement the principle of spending less money and doing more things. They are determined to complete tasks this year with one yuan that used to require one yuan sixty cents to two yuan. (Attached picture)

### 迅速发展石油工业的新道路  天然和人造石油齐头并进  全民兴办大中小型炼油厂

    迅速发展石油工业的新道路
    天然和人造石油齐头并进  全民兴办大中小型炼油厂
    新华社2日讯　我国基础极为薄弱的石油工业，已经找到了迅速发展的新道路。这条新道路就是在坚决执行中共中央提出的“天然石油和人造石油齐头并进”的方针下，用“全民搞石油”和“大中小型企业相结合”的办法，使石油工业在经过典型示范以后，也来个遍地开花。
    根据这条道路，石油工业部初步算了一笔账：预计到1962年，全国原油产量可以超过中共第八次代表大会建议原油计划产量五百万吨到六百万吨的数字。
    我国除了已经发现的几个天然油田和油区以外，人造石油的资源也很丰富。油母页岩除已经探明的茂名、抚顺等几个大矿外，据地质部在二十一个省地质调查时发现的露头就有近百处。褐煤、烟煤和无烟煤的矿藏，更是到处都有，四川盛产的天然气，也是制造人造石油的原料。特别是目前地方办工业的积极性很高，发展人造石油中的许多技术问题也已经基本上解决。因此，采取齐头并进、遍地开花的办法，就能使石油产量很快增长起来。据计算，如果平均一个专区办一个年产一万吨的人造石油厂，只需一年左右的建厂时间，全国一百八十个专区每年就能生产一百八十万吨原油，这个数字比1958年全国石油产量还大。
    为了实现这个目标，石油工业部已经制定了一系列的措施。
    首先是大力支援地方发展人造石油工业。这个部除了继续加紧建设茂名、抚顺等几个大型人造石油厂作为典型外，还正在为地方进行二十多个不同类型的中、小型炼油厂的设计。规模有适宜于省、专区、县办的年产二千吨到五万吨石油的中、小型厂，也有县以下的区乡也能办的操作很简易的小厂。生产的产品主要是能供排灌机械用的重柴油，也能加工成头等质量的汽油、煤油和轻柴油。用煤做原料时，还能生产大量的半焦，可供家庭、煤气机做燃料和制造化学肥料用。目前已有山西、江西等十个省与石油工业部取得联系，准备采用这些设计进行建设。石油工业部也已经派出三个工作组，分赴东北、华东、西北、西南等地去调查资源情况。同时准备在今年就要建设起一套示范工程，以便在取得经验以后，再帮助各地建设。
    其次，要加速天然石油的地质勘探与油田的开发，做到既有重点地搞大油田，也要充分利用小的石油资源。克拉玛依油田根据最近探明的资料证明，面积又比去年查明的扩大了好几倍，现在正在继续加紧开发。四川中部油区最近有好几口探井喷出大量原油的事实，为迅速发展石油工业提供了有利条件。由于交通方便、开采容易，目前石油工业部已在那里布置了将近一百多口探井，准备提早探明和开发这个油区。玉门油矿除了继续开发原有的老君庙油田外，还计划加速探明并开发其附近的鸭儿峡、白杨河等油田。今年，这个部还将在五个探区进行大量的地质勘探工作，石油钻井进尺将比原定计划大大增加。
    以外，这个部在最近还研究了天然气的利用问题。其途径一方面是用合成的方法将天然气加工成石油，另一方面是将天然气作为化肥及其他化工产品原料，或直接供应附近城市工厂居民作燃料或代替汽油开汽车。今年在四川黄瓜山气田附近就将建立一个合成油厂。
    目前，这条迅速发展石油工业的道路已经得到了石油工业系统广大职工的支持。许多单位的职工都已经提出要把五年的工作在二、三年内就要做完，并且坚决表示要贯彻少花钱多办事的原则。决心从今年用一块钱来完成过去要用一块六到两块钱的事。（附图片）
