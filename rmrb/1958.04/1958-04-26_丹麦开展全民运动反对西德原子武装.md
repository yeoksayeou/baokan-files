Xinhua News Agency, April 25th, dispatch from TASS, Copenhagen, April 24th: The movement protesting the atomic armament of West Germany has expanded into a national movement in Denmark. Signature collection is underway across the country for petitions to the government, demanding a ban on the atomic armament of West Germany.

The editorial department of the magazine "Free Denmark" sent postcards to 50,000 former resistance movement participants, printed with a protest letter against the atomic armament of West Germany. These postcards will be signed by those willing to participate in the protest movement, and then submitted to the Prime Minister.

The newspapers reported today that thirty-six prominent cultural figures: writers, actors, university professors, and doctors, submitted a petition to Prime Minister Hansen, emphasizing that providing atomic weapons to West Germany would not promote the cause of peace, but on the contrary, would constantly increase the danger of a new war.

The Committee of Former Resistance Movement Participants and Concentration Camp Inmates of Copenhagen, the Tenants' Union, trade unions, and other mass organizations are also collecting signatures for petitions against the atomic armament of West Germany.

    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社哥本哈根24日讯：抗议以原子武器武装西德的运动在丹麦已扩大成全民性运动。全国各地都在为给政府的呼吁书上征集签名，要求禁止原子武装西德。
    “自由丹麦”杂志编辑部给五万名前抵抗运动参加者发出了明信片，上面印有反对原子武装西德的抗议书。这些明信片将由愿意参加抗议运动的人签名，然后递交首相。
    各报今天报道，三十六名著名的文化人士：作家、演员、大学教授、医生交给汉森首相一份呼吁书，其中强调指出，向西德提供原子武器不能促进和平事业，相反的，却使新战争的危险不断增加。
