Finding Ways to Achieve Higher Yields in High-Yield Crops
Fifteen Provinces and Cities Extensively Promote Hybrid Corn Varieties

(Reported by this newspaper) This year, many regions across the country will promote hybrid corn varieties.

Production data from several regions has shown that planting hybrid corn can increase yields by an average of 50 jin per mu. If all of the country’s 200 million mu of corn land were universally converted to hybrid varieties, it would result in an annual increase of 10 billion jin of corn, which is a significant development in agricultural production.

Currently, fifteen provinces and cities, including Shandong, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Beijing, have preliminarily established plans to promote hybrid corn varieties. It is estimated that the area under hybrid corn cultivation in these regions will reach three million mu this year.

Provinces such as Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Liaoning began promoting hybrid corn varieties as early as 1952. Weifang City in Shandong Province essentially achieved universal adoption by 1957, and the area under hybrid corn cultivation in Junan County also exceeded 50%. The province promoted over 500,000 mu in 1957. The area under promotion in Henan has reached over 50,000 mu, and Shanxi is over 30,000 mu. Other provinces have also widely conducted trial demonstrations. These provinces and cities have already promoted and tested over 50 hybrid varieties, generally achieving yield increases of around 30%, with some reaching over 100%. For example, “Fangza No. 2,” promoted in Licheng County, Shandong, increased yield by 118.9 jin per mu compared to local corn varieties. Among them, the 5.3 mu of the Daxinzhuang Agricultural Cooperative achieved a yield of 457.1 jin per mu, exceeding the yield of local corn varieties by more than twofold. The Fengshan Agricultural Cooperative in Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, achieved an increase of 198.2 jin per mu by planting “Fengza No. 1.” The Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, planted 24 mu of “Changza No. 4,” averaging 650.9 jin per mu, which was 17% higher than “Golden Queen.”

To promote hybrid corn varieties, many regions have made concrete preparations. Provinces and regions such as Shandong, Guangxi, Liaoning, and Shanxi have successively trained a large number of technical backbones from agricultural cooperatives in February and March. Shandong Province has already allocated over 5 million jin of first-generation hybrid seeds. Provinces such as Guangxi, Henan, Liaoning, and Jilin are distributing a large number of parental seeds to various locations for the production of hybrid varieties. As early as this spring, Yunnan Province arranged 30 sites in the three major corn-producing regions of Zhaotong, Qujing, and Chuxiong, designating agricultural experiment stations to be responsible for guiding the testing of hybrid corn varieties.

To encourage farms and agricultural cooperatives to produce hybrid varieties, provinces and cities such as Beijing, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong have set prices for purchasing hybrid seeds, generally adding a premium of 10% to 40% compared to ordinary corn.

    高产作物中找更高产门径
    十五个省市大量推广玉米杂交种
    本报讯　今年全国许多地区都将推广玉米杂交种。
    根据好些地区生产证明，种植玉米杂交种每亩平均可增产五十斤。如果全国二亿亩的玉米普遍换成杂交种，一年就能增产一百亿斤玉米，这是农业生产上的一件大事。
    现在，山东、山西、辽宁、江苏、北京等十五个省、市都初步定出了推广玉米杂交种的规划。估计今年这些地区推广玉米杂交种的面积将有三百万亩。
    山东、山西、河南、辽宁等省早在1952年就开始推广玉米杂交种。山东潍坊市在1957年即基本普及，莒南县推广杂交种的面积也在50％以上，全省在1957年推广了五十多万亩。河南的推广面积已达五万多亩，山西也在三万亩以上，其他各省也都广泛地作了试种示范。这些省、市已经推广和试种的杂交种共有五十多个，一般增产30％左右，高的竟达一倍以上。例如山东历城县推广的“坊杂2号”比土种玉米每亩增产一百一十八点九斤；其中大辛庄农业社的五点三亩，亩产达到四百五十七点一斤，超过当地土种玉米产量二倍以上。辽宁省凤城县凤山农业社种植“凤杂1号”，每亩增产达一百九十八点二斤。山西省陵川县星火农业社种植“长杂4号”二十四亩，平均每亩产六百五十点九斤，比金皇后还增产17％。
    为了推广玉米杂交种，很多地区进行了具体的准备。山东、广西、辽宁、山西等省区，已在2、3月份先后训练了大批农业社的技术骨干。山东省已经调剂五百多万斤杂交一代种子；广西、河南、辽宁、吉林等省，正将大量亲本种子分发各地配制杂交种。云南省早在今年春天就在昭通、曲靖、楚雄三个主要产玉米的专区，布置了三十个点，指定农业试验站负责指导进行玉米杂交种的试验工作。
    为了鼓励农场和农业社配制杂交种，北京、河南、山西、山东等省、市，都订出收购杂交种的价格，一般都比普通玉米加价10％—40％。
