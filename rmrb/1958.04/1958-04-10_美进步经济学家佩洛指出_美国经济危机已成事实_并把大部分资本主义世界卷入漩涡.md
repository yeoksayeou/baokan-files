Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from New York: The "National Guardian" weekly published on the 7th carried an article by Victor Perlo, an American progressive economist, pointing out that the existence of the American economic "crisis is beyond doubt."

The article emphasized that "This is not a temporary recession. It is a typical crisis of overproduction, at least of medium severity. After this crisis, there will be a depression. During the depression, output will remain close to the lowest level. Difficult times will last for at least two or three years."

The article continued, "This is a real crisis because the center of this crisis is the powerful capital goods industry." Before this crisis, there had been a prosperity of expanding production capacity. But this situation turned into a significant surplus of production capacity by 1957. The article believes that this is precisely the inevitable result of capitalist "prosperity."

The article then discussed the situation of reduced corporate investment: Last November, companies announced plans to cut investment by 7% this year. In reality, the investment amount will decrease. Manufacturing companies plan to reduce new projects by 30% this year, which foreshadows a further reduction in investment in 1959.

The article pointed out that the severity of this crisis is also reflected in its scope expanding to most of the capitalist world. Japanese steel production has decreased; textile production has decreased by 30%. West German steel production has also decreased by 10%.

Financial crises will also follow. "The stock market plunged at the end of last year. The number of corporate bankruptcies reached the highest peak in twenty-five years. (In installment payment transactions) the phenomenon of repossessing cars and canceling the right to redeem mortgages due to buyers' inability to pay is becoming increasingly serious. The turnover of the two largest railways in the United States has also experienced a surprising decline."

The number of unemployed people is constantly increasing. In most industrial areas, the impoverished lives of large numbers of unemployed people are reminiscent of the 1930s.

The article accused government and congressional leaders of giving money to vested interest groups under the guise of "preventing recession." "They are implementing the long-term strategy of big capitalists: to get through the crisis by sacrificing the common people in order to restore profit margins, and ultimately to solve this crisis."

The article continued, the Senate recently passed a bill to provide retroactive tax cuts of $121 million to large life insurance companies. These companies already pay almost no taxes. This measure is a blatant plunder carried out by the most powerful and prosperous companies. Only nineteen senators voted against the bill. This shows how much influence financial giants have over congressmen.

The article pointed out that Eisenhower's decision to allocate funds from the Federal Aid Fund to accelerate public works, the so-called "Emergency Housing Construction Act" passed by Congress, as well as accelerating the signing of military equipment orders and increasing military appropriations, cannot "offset the overall impact of the crisis," but only allow big capitalists to obtain more profits.

The article said that according to Eisenhower's request to Congress to authorize the extension of the time limit for unemployed workers to receive unemployment benefits by half, the total amount of relief paid to two million workers in one year is 600 million US dollars, which is only equivalent to 7% of the wages lost by two million workers in one year.

The article concluded that all the actions currently taken by the federal and local governments will result in: procurement of weapons may increase by 3 billion US dollars annually, while the amount of money used for public construction this year will not exceed 2 billion US dollars. In contrast, the decline in commercial investment (including inventory) and exports this year will reach 15 billion US dollars. The article pointed out that there is currently nothing that can prevent the number of unemployed from increasing to seven or eight million this winter.

    美进步经济学家佩洛指出
    美国经济危机已成事实
    并把大部分资本主义世界卷入漩涡
    新华社9日讯　纽约消息：7日出版的“国民前卫”周刊刊登了美国进步经济学家维克多·佩洛的一篇文章，指出美国经济“危机的存在已经无可怀疑”。
    文章强调说，“这不是一次暂时的衰退。这是一次生产过剩的典型危机，至少具有中等程度的严重性。在这次危机之后将出现萧条。在萧条期间，产量将会保持在接近最低的水平上。困难的时期至少会持续两三年。”
    文章接着指出，“这是一次真正的危机，因为这次危机的中心是强大的资本货物工业。”在这次危机之前曾经有过扩大生产能力的繁荣。但是这种局面到1957年变成了显著的生产能力过剩。文章认为，这正是资本主义“繁荣”所必然带来的结果。
    文章接着谈到企业投资削减的情况：去年11月，各公司宣布了要在今年削减投资7％的计划。而实际上投资额将减少。制造公司计划今年减少新工程30％，这预示着在1959年投资还会进一步减少。
    文章指出，这次危机的严重性还表现在它的范围扩大到大部分资本主义世界。日本钢产量减少了；纺织品产量减少了30％。西德钢产量也减少了10％。
    金融危机也将相继发生。“去年年底股票市场猛跌。企业破产数字达到二十五年来的最高峰。（分期付款交易中）由于买主不能付清货款而收回汽车以及取消赎取抵押品的权利的现象日益严重。美国两条最大的铁路的营业额也有了惊人的下降。”
    失业人数不断增加。在大多数工业地区，大批失业者所过的贫困生活令人回忆起三十年代的情况。
    文章指责政府和国会的领袖们正在“制止衰退”的幌子下把钱送给既得利益集团。“他们正在执行大资本家的长期策略：通过牺牲老百姓以恢复利润率的做法来渡过危机，并且最后来解决这种危机。”
    文章接着说，参议院最近通过一项对人寿保险大公司实行一亿二千一百万美元追溯性减税的法案。这些公司本来就几乎不缴什么税。这项措施是最有势力的、最兴隆的公司所进行的公然掠夺。只有十九个参议员投票反对这个法案。这表明金融巨头对议员们的影响有多么大。
    文章指出，艾森豪威尔决定由联邦援助基金拨款来加速进行公共工程、国会所通过的所谓“紧急建造房屋法案”以及加速签订军备订货合同和增加军事拨款的做法都不可能“抵销危机的总的影响”，而只是使大资本家获得更多利润。
    文章说，根据艾森豪威尔要求国会授权把失业工人领取失业救济金时限延长一半的建议，一年中付给二百万工人的救济金总额是六亿美元，只相当于二百万工人在一年中所损失的工资的7％。
    文章最后说，联邦政府和地方政府目前所采取的一切行动加起来，结果将是：采购武器的款项每年或许可以增加三十亿美元，而今年内用于公共修建的款项增加的数目将不超过二十亿美元。与此相对照的是，今年内商业投资（包括存货在内）和出口的下降却将达到一百五十亿美元。文章指出，目前还看不到有任何东西能够阻止失业人数在今年冬季增加到七百万或八百万人。
