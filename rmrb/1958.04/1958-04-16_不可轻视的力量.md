A Power Not to Be Underestimated

The practices of the Tianjin General Paper Mill's repair workshop in manufacturing paper-making machines and the Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory's repair department in manufacturing machinery equipment demonstrate that there is a considerably strong potential force in the manufacturing of machinery and equipment. This is the machine repair and maintenance departments distributed in various industries across the country. This force cannot be underestimated. For example, the repair workshop of the Yongli Jiuda Dagukou Plant has more than 800 employees. In terms of equipment, technology, and personnel, it is no less than a medium-sized machine manufacturing plant. Such repair workshops are certainly few in number, but the combined machine repair capabilities of all walks of life constitute an immeasurable force. Moreover, the repair departments of large and medium-sized factories have more experienced technicians. They are familiar with the machine manufacturing in their respective industries and are also familiar with the usage of the machines in their respective industries. Therefore, it is entirely possible to engage in manufacturing concurrently.

To truly serve as an assistant to the machinery and electronics industry, the machine repair departments must overcome the mindset of "doing work only when there is work, and resting when there is no work" and "only repairing for their own factory, regardless of external needs." It is especially important that the leaders at all levels of the enterprises take on the manufacturing tasks.

    不可轻视的力量
    天津造纸总厂修理车间制造造纸机和天津市织染厂修理部制造机器设备的做法，表明在机器设备的制造方面，还有一支力量相当雄厚的潜在队伍。这就是分布在全国各地各行各业中的机修保全部门。这支力量不能小看。例如永利久大沽厂的修理车间有八百多个职工，论设备，论技术，论人数，都不亚于一个中型的机器制造厂。这样的修理车间固然为数不多，但把各行各业的机修力量汇集起来，就是一支不可估计的力量。而且，大、中型工厂的修理部门，老技术工人比较多。他们熟悉本行的机器制造，也熟悉本行机器的使用状况。因此，兼做制造是完全可能的。
    要真正起到机电工业助手的作用，机修部门必须克服“有活就做，没活就歇”、“只为本厂修理，不管门外需要”的思想。尤其重要的，是企业的各级领导要把制造的任务承担下来。
