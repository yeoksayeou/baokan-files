Preliminary examination reveals all six "airs" present. Determined to rectify. Singing four lines:

　　Determined to rectify the six "airs," striving for both red and expert.
　　Manifested in action, willing to be the first in the world.

[Note] Among intellectuals, in addition to official air, senile air, wealthy air, arrogant air, and pampered air, there is one more. This is the literati air, the bookworm air, the academic air. Nowadays, it is generally called bookishness. The main content of bookishness is walking with measured steps, doing things in a muddled way, "thinking thrice" but "not acting," and so on. The six "airs" are all products of bourgeois ideology. If we don't eliminate the six "airs," our socialist cause cannot advance.

    自唱
    邓初民
    初步检查，六气俱全，决心整改，唱歌四句：
    决心整六气，争取红与专。
    表现在行动，愿为天下先。
    〔附注〕在知识分子中，除了官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气之外，还多一气。这就是文人气，书呆子气，书生气。现在一般叫作书生气。书生气的主要内容，是走路踱方步，作事拖泥带水，“三思”而“不行”等等。六气都是资产阶级思想的产物，不整掉六气，我们社会主义事业就不能前进。
