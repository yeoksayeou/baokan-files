Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 8th: Brahim Ghafa, representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, and Adef Danier, representative of the Arab People's Congress, who were invited to China to participate in the Chinese people's "Day of Support for Algeria" activities, left Guangzhou by train this morning to return to their country. Before their departure, they spoke about their impressions of China and the friendship between the Chinese and Algerian people.

Brahim Ghafa said that the solidarity between the Chinese and Algerian people is very solid. He said that after participating in the "Day of Support for Algeria" rallies held by people from all walks of life in Beijing and Shanghai, he felt that these rallies expressed the brotherly feelings of the Chinese people, which made him feel supported. He said that China had also been oppressed by imperialism and colonialism in the past, so it is easy for the Chinese and Algerian people to understand each other. We have a common desire to liberate the people of Asia and Africa and live an independent and free life. He said that today, 1.6 billion people have awakened, and national awakening has overwhelmed everything in Asian and African countries, whether in rural areas or remote places.

Brahim Ghafa said that now we can go back with confidence because I have learned that all levels of Chinese society are supporting us. China has extended a hand of friendship to Algeria.

Adef Danier, representative of the Arab People's Congress, said that the connection between China and Algeria existed long ago, and now the colonialists have reunited us anew. He said that this is the only commendable thing about imperialism. He said that to maintain peace, it is sometimes necessary to take up arms, because there can be no lasting peace with colonialism.

Brahim Ghafa and Adef Danier arrived in Guangzhou by plane from Nanchang on the 7th.

    卜拉欣·加法和阿德夫·达尼尔回国
    行前盛赞中国和阿尔及利亚人民的友谊
    新华社广州8日电　应邀来我国参加中国人民“声援阿尔及利亚日”活动的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表卜拉欣·加法和阿拉伯人民大会代表阿德夫·达尼尔，今天上午乘火车离开广州回国。他们在回国以前谈到了他们对中国的观感和中国、阿尔及利亚两国人民的友谊。
    卜拉欣·加法说，中国和阿尔及利亚两国人民的团结是十分坚固的。他说，他参加了北京和上海召开的各界人民“声援阿尔及利亚日”的大会后，感到这些大会表达出了中国人民的兄弟般的感情，使他觉得得到一种支持。他说，中国过去也受到帝国主义和殖民主义的压迫，因此中国和阿尔及利亚人民之间容易互相谅解，我们有着共同的愿望，就是使亚非人民解放出来，过上独立自由的生活。他说，今天十六亿的人民已经觉悟过来，亚非国家中不论在农村或遥远的地方，民族觉醒已盖倒一切。
    卜拉欣·加法说，现在我们可以充满信心地回去，因为我了解到中国各阶层都在支持着我们。中国向阿尔及利亚伸出了友谊的手。
    阿拉伯人民大会代表阿德夫·达尼尔说，中国和阿尔及利亚两国的联系早就有，现在殖民主义者使我们又从新团结在一起。他说，这是帝国主义唯一可取之处。他说，要维护和平有时需要拿起武器，因为有殖民主义就不可能有持久和平。
    卜拉欣·加法和阿德夫·达尼尔是7日从南昌乘飞机到达广州的。
