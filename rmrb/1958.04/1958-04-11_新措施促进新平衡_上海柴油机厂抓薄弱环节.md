New Measures Promote New Balance
Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant Grasps Weak Links
(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Liberation Daily, the Shanghai Diesel Engine Plant, in the upsurge of comparing with the advanced and competing for more, faster, better, and more economical results, actively adopted measures to overcome the imbalance between various workshops and sections, ensuring a great leap forward in production.

In the plant’s leap forward in production, some departments improved faster, while others improved slower. For example, the output of the diesel engine workshop more than doubled compared to the past, requiring the foundry workshop to provide more than 4,000 tons more castings than last year. However, due to limited conditions, the foundry workshop was unable to meet this requirement, affecting balanced production. The plant adopted the method of the advanced leading the less advanced. On the one hand, it organized the diesel engine workshop to send good news reports to the foundry workshop. On the other hand, it organized the foundry workshop workers to find ways to solve the difficulties of insufficient space, drying rooms, and cranes. Now, the production capacity of castings has basically been balanced with the diesel engine workshop.

Due to the leap forward in production in various workshops, the originally arranged plans were completely disrupted. In particular, the work plans for workers drawn up by the workshop planners often lagged behind the actual production in the case of many workers increasing their output by multiples, failing to play a role in organizing production. Faced with such a new situation, the comrades in the planning department changed their practice of sitting in the office to compile plans and issue targets. They all went deep into the workshops and adopted the method of formulating plans on-site, handing over the entire month's production tasks to the masses, who put forward their own plans based on their own production capacity and considering the advanced measures to be taken. The workshop then summarized and drew up the workshop plan, which was then balanced by the planning section. This method of formulating plans from the bottom up made the plans more realistic, able to play a role in organizing production, and avoided production chaos.

In addition, with the leap forward in production, the original reasonable technological routes became unreasonable. In order to solve this problem, the technicians of the process section went down to the workshops and, together with the workers, comprehensively analyzed the equipment capacity and component processing situation in the workshops based on the increase in production tasks. Through analysis, they identified the weak links in the equipment and immediately took measures, either modifying the equipment or adjusting the process, and the problem was quickly resolved.

### 新措施促进新平衡  上海柴油机厂抓薄弱环节

    新措施促进新平衡
    上海柴油机厂抓薄弱环节
    本报讯　据解放日报报道：上海柴油机厂在比先进、比多快好省的热潮中，积极采取措施，克服各车间、工段之间的不平衡现象，保证了生产大跃进。
    这个厂的生产在跃进中，有的部门提高较快，有的部门提高较慢。如柴油机车间的产量比过去提高了一倍多，需要翻砂车间提供比去年多四千多吨的铸件，但翻砂车间因为条件限制，无法满足这个要求，影响了均衡生产。厂里采用了以先进带后进的办法，一方面组织柴油机车间向翻砂车间送喜报，另一方面组织翻砂车间工人设法解决场地、烘房和行车不够的困难，现在，铸件的生产能力已基本上可以与柴油机车间相平衡。
    由于各车间生产上的跃进，原来安排下去的计划全部打乱了，特别是车间计划员排的工人的作业计划，在许多工人成倍地提高产量的情况下，经常落后于生产实际，无法起到组织生产的作用。面对这样的新形势，计划部门的同志改变了坐办公室编计划和下达指标的做法，全部深入到车间去，采取现场订计划的办法，将全月生产任务交给群众，由群众根据自己的生产能力，并考虑到准备采取的先进措施提出自己的计划，由车间汇总排出车间计划，再由计划科进行平衡。这种自下而上订计划的办法，使订出的计划比较切合实际，能发挥组织生产的作用，而且避免了生产上的混乱。
    另外，生产跃进了，原来合理的工艺路线也不合理了。为了解决这个问题，工艺科的技术员就下车间，与工人一起根据生产任务的增长情况，全面分析车间的设备能力和部件加工情况，通过分析，找出设备上的薄弱环节，并立即采取措施，或者改装设备，或者调整工艺，问题很快就得到解决。
