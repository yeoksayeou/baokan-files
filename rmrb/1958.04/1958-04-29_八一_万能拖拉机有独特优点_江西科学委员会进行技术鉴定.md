Nanchang, April 28th (This newspaper dispatch) The Jiangxi Provincial Science Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 28th to conduct a scientific and technical appraisal of the "August 1st" brand universal tractor recently trial-produced by the Jiangxi Machinery Factory, a local state-owned enterprise.

At the meeting, Feng Anguo, the appraiser and chief consultant for the trial production of the "August 1st" brand universal tractor, read out the appraisal report on behalf of the Provincial Science Committee. Feng Anguo said that the "August 1st" brand universal tractor has good performance and its specifications fully meet the original design standards, and it can be put into batch production immediately. He said that this tractor is a highly versatile and efficient amphibious tractor, suitable not only for plowing, harrowing, sowing, cultivating, weeding, harvesting, threshing, and blending operations, but also as power for more than fifty uses such as drainage and irrigation, power generation, drilling, sawing wood, milling rice, oil pressing, and transportation. The "August 1st" brand universal tractor consumes an average of half a kilogram of oil per mu of farmland, only half that of ordinary tractors, while its work efficiency is twice as high as that of similar types of tractors.

Huang Fuquan, an excellent driver from the Nanchang "August 1st" Tractor Station, said that he had driven many brands of tractors, and felt that the "August 1st" brand universal tractor had many unique advantages: high tillage efficiency and excellent tillage quality.

    “八一”万能拖拉机有独特优点
    江西科学委员会进行技术鉴定
    本报南昌28日电　江西省科学委员会于28日上午开会，对地方国营江西机械厂最近试制成功的“八一”牌万能拖拉机进行科学技术鉴定。
    在这次会上，鉴定人、“八一”牌万能拖拉机试制总顾问冯安国，代表省科学委员会宣读了鉴定书。冯安国说，“八一”牌万能拖拉机效能良好，规格完全合乎原设计标准，可以马上投入成批生产。他说，这种拖拉机是一种通用性很广、效率很高的水旱两用拖拉机，除适于耕、耙、播、中耕、除草、收获、脱粒和调制作业外，并可作为动力用于排水灌溉、发电、打洞、锯木、碾米、榨油以及运输等五十多种用途。“八一”牌万能拖拉机耕田一亩平均耗油半公斤，仅及一般拖拉机的二分之一，而工作效率比相似类型的拖拉机却高出一倍。
    南昌“八一”拖拉机站的优秀驾驶员黄富泉说，他驾驶过许多种牌名的拖拉机，感觉“八一”牌万能拖拉机有许多独特的优点：耕作效率很高，耕作质量很好。
    中共江西省委第一书记杨尚奎和省长邵式平在会上讲了话，给“八一”牌万能拖拉机以很高的评价。
