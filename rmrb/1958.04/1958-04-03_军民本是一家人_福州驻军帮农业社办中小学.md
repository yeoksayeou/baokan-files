Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 2nd – A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Fuzhou, whose members attend a quick-study middle school for culture, is assisting agricultural cooperatives in establishing private middle schools and spare-time primary schools.

After more than a month of preparation, the Zhanban Township Agricultural Middle School in the suburbs of Fuzhou opened on the 2nd. Eighty percent of the curriculum of this middle school, namely the Chinese and mathematics courses, are taught on a voluntary basis by teachers from the army's quick-study middle school for culture. All teaching aids are also borrowed or donated by the army's quick-study middle school for culture.

In addition, the army's quick-study middle school for culture has decided to assist the local people in establishing a spare-time primary school to help members of the agricultural cooperative learn culture. All the primary school teachers will be concurrently and voluntarily taken on by teachers from the quick-study middle school.

The staff and students of this quick-study middle school are also actively helping the seven production teams of the local agricultural cooperative to carry out literacy work, striving to enable each of the existing six hundred illiterate people to learn one thousand to one thousand five hundred characters within a year.

    福州驻军帮农业社办中小学
    新华社福建前线2日电　中国人民解放军驻福州部队某部文化速成中学，正在协助农业社创立民办中学和业余小学。
    经过一个多月的筹备，福州市郊战坂乡农业中学 2日开学了。这个中学占全部课程80％的语文、数学课程，由部队文化速成中学的教员义务担任教学，教学用具也是全部由部队文化速成中学借用或赠送的。
    这个部队文化速成中学另外决定协助驻地人民建立一所业余小学，帮助农业社社员们学习文化。小学教员全部由速成中学教员义务兼任。
    这个速成中学的工作人员和学员还积极帮助驻地农业社的七个生产队进行扫盲工作，争取在一年内使现有的六百名文盲每人识字一千到一千五百个。
