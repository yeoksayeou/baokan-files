When Lu Dingyi delivered his speech, the audience repeatedly burst into warm applause. Liao Chengzhi said at the meeting that today the Party Central Committee specially sent Comrade Lu Dingyi to attend our congress and address the congress. Let us warmly pay our highest respect to the great Chinese Communist Party that leads us forward. We assure our beloved Party and Chairman Mao that we will always listen to the Party and bravely advance in the direction guided by the Party, and will never fail the Party and Chairman Mao's teachings and expectations.

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said in his speech that today's Chinese youth are extremely happy, and at the same time their responsibilities are extremely important. Young people should build on the past and open up the future. Not only should they today shoulder the arduous task of building socialism together with the people of the whole country, but they will also bear the great responsibility of building communism in the future. This requires young comrades to continuously strengthen their political and ideological training and continuously master new production technologies.

Shen Junru, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said in his speech that the great new era in which we live places strict and eager demands on our generation of intellectuals, whether old or young. We must do the following: (1) Strive to study Marxism-Leninism and closely integrate it with social practice; (2) Strive to become a new socialist person who combines mental and physical labor; (3) Strive to master modern science and technology, so that we can catch up in the technological revolution of our motherland and the world's march towards nature.

Shi Fuliang, Deputy Director of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, in his speech, requested that young people in industry and commerce, especially members of the Minjian, should play a backbone role in the self-reform movement of industry and commerce, not only seriously examine their shortcomings and errors in their political stance and work style, and earnestly and thoroughly reform themselves, but also adopt a sincere, enthusiastic, and humble attitude, patiently and actively help others, so that everyone can pass the socialist test well and serve socialism wholeheartedly.

Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said in his speech that it is the common responsibility of the nation's youth to be strong builders and defenders of the motherland. The youth in our army must achieve excellence in learning, labor, discipline, thrift, and health in the Great Leap Forward in supporting the country's socialist construction, building the army diligently and thriftily, and combat training. The nation's youth should also actively support our country's national defense construction, and bravely shoulder the sacred task of building and defending the motherland.

Gu Dachun, Secretary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, encouraged young workers to become the most conscious part of our country's youth of all strata, to become models in implementing the Party's policies, to become models in studying Marxism-Leninism and self-reform, and to become models in consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and strengthening unity.

Gu Dachun said that young people must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Modesty helps one to progress, while arrogance makes one lag behind." Young people should learn from the revolutionary predecessors, learn their spirit of heroic struggle, and their style of diligence and thrift. Young workers in factories and mines should especially learn from the old workers and obtain their help and guidance.

Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said: The responsibility of the younger generation is significant. The new China, founded by the revolutionary predecessors through bloodshed, sacrifice, and arduous struggle, will depend on the younger generation to defend, build, and develop it in the future. In order to shoulder this significant responsibility, young men and women comrades need to strictly demand of themselves, accelerate their progress, and strive to make greater contributions to socialism.

Le Songsheng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, requested in his speech that young people in industry and commerce play a pioneering role in the self-reform movement, rapidly advance on the socialist road, and better serve socialism.

The speeches of the guests were warmly welcomed by the youth representatives.

After the speeches, Liu Xiyuan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, delivered a report to the congress on behalf of the Second Committee of the All-China Youth Federation, entitled "Exert Full Effort, Strive for Advancement, and Play a Pioneering Role in the Socialist Great Leap Forward."
