    Que Shengyun Diligently Works and Studies to Support His Family
    Li Fan
    Que Shengyun, a twenty-two-year-old student from a poor peasant family at Yiyang Normal School in Hunan, has been supporting his family with his own labor since he entered middle school while also studying.
    In 1952, Que Shengyun was admitted to Yiyang County No. 4 Middle School, which was only about a mile from his home. The state provided him with a living allowance, so studying for a semester didn't cost much. But what about the farm work in the fields? He would get up in the dark every morning to dig soil, plant vegetables, chop firewood, and dig grass sod. Sometimes during his lunch break, he would go back to carry grass sod and turn over the mounds. After school in the afternoon, he would eat dinner and work until dark, doing five or six hours of work each day, and a full day on Sundays. In 1953, he took the lead in planting all the fields with double-cropping rice, and the more than three mu of land yielded twenty-five dan of grain, an increase of 40%. The vegetables he grew were also very large, with bean pods and peppers hanging in strings, and they rarely got infested with insects. After graduating from junior high school in 1955, he went to Yiyang Normal School, which was fifteen miles from his home. His family joined an agricultural cooperative, and he still returned home on Sundays and holidays to engage in production.
    During the summer vacation of 1956, in July, it was the busy season for harvesting and planting. Que Shengyun invited three young people to form a shock team, working from before dawn until after dusk each day, harvesting 2,800 jin of grain in a day. The sun was scorching hot, and sweat poured down, wearing out the skin on their fingers. They applied plaster and continued working. During the forty-two-day summer vacation, he earned 490 work points, earning more than forty-eight yuan. On August 25, the Party member and cooperative chairman, Mo Ziqun, introduced him to the Communist Youth League.
    Last summer vacation and on Sundays, he earned a total of more than 700 work points. The family had enough grain to eat for the whole year; they also grew miscellaneous grains and vegetables in their own fields, and the money from selling them could be used to buy daily necessities; all the firewood for burning was chopped by himself, and he also raised a pig. The family lived a comfortable life.
    Que Shengyun can work and also study well. From the first semester of the second year of junior high school, he received scholarships every semester. At Yiyang Normal School last semester, he got five points in seven of the thirteen subjects, four points in five subjects, and only three points in music. When he was in No. 4 Middle School, he would still read books and do homework late at night under the tung oil lamp. On winter nights, when the lamp oil ran out, he would take out burning twigs from the brazier and wave them back and forth to see the questions on the book clearly, and think about the answers while lying in bed.
    Que Shengyun usually lives frugally and doesn't spend a penny carelessly. He spent eight jiao to buy an old fountain pen, which he used for five and a half years; he spent six fen to buy two packets of ink powder, which he used for a semester. When he went home, he was afraid that walking a long distance would ruin his shoes, so he bought a pair of straw sandals to wear. When the weather was warm, he simply went barefoot. He usually wears peasant clothes, and you can't tell that he is a student.
    Que Shengyun, this diligent student who works hard and studies well, has become a role model for his classmates. Recently, he participated in the Hunan Province Conference of Active Laborers Among University and Middle School Students and was commended.

    阙胜云勤耕苦读养全家
    黎凡
    湖南益阳师范学校有一个二十二岁的贫农学生阙胜云，从进中学起，就一面读书，一面用自己的劳动养活一家人。
    1952年，阙胜云考取了离家只有里把路远的益阳县四中。国家给他助学金，读一期书不要好多钱。可是田里的农事活怎么办呢？他便每天清早摸黑起床，挖土、种菜、砍柴、挖草皮。有时中午休息，他也回去担草皮，翻氹子。下午放学吃了饭，一直干到天黑。这样每天做五六个钟头工夫。星期天干一整天。1953年，他带头将全部田种上双季稻，三亩多田收了二十五担谷子，增产40％。他种的蔬菜也有好大一蔸，豆壳、辣椒挂满一串串，很少起虫。1955年初中毕业，他到益阳师范学校读书，离家十五里。他家加入了农业社，星期日和假期他仍回家搞生产。
    1956年暑假，7月间，正是抢收抢种紧张时节。阙胜云邀了三个青年组成一个突击组，每天干个两头见月亮，一天扮到二千八百斤谷子。太阳火热，汗流如洗，手指皮都磨烂了，他们敷上石膏继续干。在四十二天暑假里，他做了四百九十分工，收入四十八元多。8月25日，党员社长莫梓群介绍他加入了青年团。
    去年暑假和星期天，他一共做了七百多分工。全家一年的粮食足够吃了；自家地里还种了杂粮和蔬菜，卖了钱可以买日用品；烧的柴全是自己砍的，还喂了一头猪，一家人的生活过得很舒畅。
    阙胜云会劳动也会读书。从初中二年上期起，他期期得到奖学金。在益阳师范学校，去年下期十三门功课有七门五分，五门四分，只音乐三分。在四中的时候，他深夜还在桐油灯下看书做作业。冬天晚上，灯油用完了，他从烘笼里夹出火枝子来回晃动，看清书上的题目，睡在床上想答案。
    阙胜云平时生活俭朴，不乱用一个钱。他花八角钱买一支旧钢笔，用了五年半；花六分钱买两包墨水粉子，用一学期。他回家怕路远走烂鞋子，就买双草鞋穿，天气暖和时干脆打赤脚。他平时老是穿一身农民服装，看不出是学生。
    阙胜云，这个勤耕苦读的好学生，成了同学们学习的榜样。最近，他参加湖南省大中学生学余劳动积极分子会议，受到了表扬。
