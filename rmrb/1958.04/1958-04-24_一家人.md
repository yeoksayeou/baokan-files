A Family
Zou Difan

Opposing the testing of hydrogen bombs, the people of London marched. They shouted slogans: "We want negotiations, not war!" Look, what a moving scene. This is a construction worker's entire family, participating in the march. The father pushes a small wheelchair with a child in it, the mother pushes a baby carriage, the baby inside crying softly. And four other children follow behind, raising their little fists indignantly: "We want bread and sweets, not war!" I read the news of the London march in our spring plowing countryside. I saw a rural family of six here: they are also marching in the spring, for the great leap forward in production. The old grandfather's hair is like silver, following the technical team pruning trees and trimming branches in the orchard. The father, for the rural electrification, sings songs while ramming the earth at the pumping station construction site. The mother is planting yam seeds, the greening task is urgent, the older brother is leading the younger siblings to plant windbreaks. Peace songs are boiling in our countryside, fruit trees are marching in the spring, electricity is sent marching with green water to the fields, high-yield crops are marching in the yellow earth, windbreaks are marching in pairs in the wilderness, the spring breeze blows "war" without a trace.

    一家人
    邹荻帆反对试验氢弹，伦敦人民大游行。他们高喊着口号：“我们要谈判，不要战争！”看，这情景多么动人，这是一个建筑工人的全家，全家参加大游行：爸爸推动坐有孩子的小轮椅，妈妈推动婴儿车，车内婴儿哭
  嘤嘤，还有四个孩子在后面跟举起小拳头气愤愤：“要面包、糖果，不要战争！”我在我们春耕的农村，读到伦敦游行的电文。我看到我们一个农村的家庭：他们一家六口人，也在春季大游行，为的是生产大跃进。老爷爷头发如白银，随技术队刮树、剪枝在花果林。爸爸为了农村电气化，扬水站工地打夯有歌声。妈妈正在点山药种，绿化任务又来得紧，哥哥带着弟妹种防风林。和平歌在我们的农村沸腾，花果树在春天游行，电力送绿水到田亩上游行，多产作物在黄土里游行，防风林结伴在野地上游行，春风把“战争”吹得无踪无影。
