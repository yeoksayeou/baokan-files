Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: The Japanese Foreign Ministry announced today that the Japanese government submitted a memorandum on April 4th to the embassies of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in Japan, requesting a cessation of nuclear tests.

In the "Suggestions to the Soviet Union" section of the memorandum, the Japanese government expressed its welcome for the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally halt nuclear testing. However, on the other hand, disregarding the fact that the United States and Britain insist on continuing nuclear weapons testing, the Japanese government insisted that the Soviet Union abandon its proposal to reserve freedom of action in the event that other countries continue to test nuclear weapons.

In the "Suggestions to the United States and Britain" section of the memorandum, the Japanese government expressed its "strong demand that the governments of the United States and Britain cease nuclear testing," and euphemistically stated that the United States and Britain "have not been able to take the initiative" to stop nuclear testing, which "is also regrettable from the point of view of the solidarity of the free world."

In this memorandum, the Japanese government expressed its hope that the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain would make efforts at the possible East-West summit and United Nations meetings to promote the signing of an agreement on the prohibition of the use, production, and stockpiling of nuclear weapons.

    日本欢迎苏联停止核试验
    要求美英两国采同样措施
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本外务省今天宣布，日本政府在4日把一项关于要求停止核试验的备忘录送交美英苏三国驻日本的大使馆。
    日本政府在备忘录的“对苏联的建议”部分中，表示欢迎苏联关于单方面停止核试验的决定。但是，另一方面，日本政府却不顾美英两国坚持要继续进行核武器试验的事实，硬要苏联放弃它所提出的苏联将在其它国家继续试验核武器的情况下保留行动自由的权利。
    在备忘录的“对美英两国的建议”部分中，日本政府表示“强烈要求美英两国政府停止核试验”，并且委婉地说，美英两国“没有能够站在主动地位”来停止核试验，这从“自由国家集团的团结方面来说，也是令人遗憾的”。
    日本政府在这项备忘录中，表示希望苏联和美英两国政府在可能举行的东西方最高级会议和联合国会议上进行努力，促使有关国家签订关于禁止使用、生产和储备核武器的协定。
