    A Frugal Performance
    The Qinghai Provincial National Song and Dance Troupe recently staged the multi-act drama "Song of Youth" in Xining. The entire cost, including stage props, sets, lighting, actors' costumes, and makeup, amounted to only 120 yuan.
    The National Song and Dance Troupe rehearsed this play during the Two Antis Campaign. They organized six shock groups to inventory the warehouse and accounts, making every effort to utilize anything available in the warehouse. Large and small props were borrowed from other units whenever possible, and made by themselves whenever possible. For costumes, some old ones were altered, and most were made using the actors' own clothing. The scenery was made by utilizing existing old ones, pasting a layer of newspaper on them, and then painting them. Although the performance cost very little, it did not affect the effectiveness of the performance. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一次节约的演出
    青海省民族歌舞剧团最近在西宁上演多幕话剧“青春之歌”，全部费用，包括舞台上的道具、装置、灯光以及演员的服装和化妆品等，只花了一百二十元。
    民族歌舞剧团是在双反运动中排演这部戏的，他们组织了六个突击组，清查了仓库和账目，把仓库里凡是可用的东西都尽量利用上。大、小道具能向其他单位借用的就借，能自己做的就自己做。服装一部分用旧的翻改，大部分利用演员自己的。布景是把旧有的利用起来，糊上一层报纸，上面再涂上颜色。这次演出虽然花钱很少，但并没有影响演出的效果。　（新华社）
