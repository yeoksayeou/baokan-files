Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: Beijing's democratic parties and non-party democratic figures held a confession meeting to the Party today at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall.

After Jiang Guangnai, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), announced the opening of the meeting, Wu Han, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, delivered a speech saying: The democratic parties and non-party democratic figures in Beijing have entered the general rectification phase. The most important thing in carrying out the transformation of political stance is to hand over our hearts to the Party and to the people without reservation. This is the fundamental prerequisite for self-transformation. Wu Han said: The people of the whole country are leaping forward with the force of ten thousand horses. We, the members of democratic parties and non-party democratic figures in Beijing, must be determined to transform ourselves, catch up quickly, and overtake, handing over the unsightly and dirty things in our hearts without reservation, transforming wavering loyalty into utter devotion, uniting tens of thousands of hearts into one, and handing this heart over to the Communist Party, resolutely following the Communist Party.

More than a dozen members of various democratic parties spoke at today's meeting, initially discussing erroneous thoughts that they had never exposed over the years. Chu Xichun, a member of the RCCK and Counselor of the State Council, said that since liberation, he had been lukewarm and wavering in his attitude towards the Communist Party and socialism, believing that there was no place for him in today's world, so he did not have a sense of ownership. After discussing his erroneous thoughts on the land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the elimination of counter-revolutionaries, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and the anti-rightist movement, Chu Xichun said: Today I have preliminarily dug out my ugly heart, and I will continue to dig in the future, striving to pass this stage of socialism happily. Chen Shihua, a member of the China Democratic League and Vice President of Tsinghua University, said that due to the dragging down of bourgeois individualism, he had been at odds with the Party for a long time. He "accepted 'happily' the tasks assigned by the Party, completed them passively; appeared relaxed on the surface, but felt heavy inside; readily agreed, but was full of complaints." Chen Shihua used many specific ideological situations to illustrate his dissatisfaction with the Party's policy and methods of leading the school, and his doubts about the Party's policy of transforming intellectuals. He expressed his determination to break through all concerns and further shake off all the dirty things in his pockets, drop the burden, and move forward lightly. Wu Yan, a member of the China Association for Promoting Democracy and Director of the Primary Education Department of the Ministry of Education, spoke in detail about his failure to completely abandon Dewey's reactionary pragmatist education, his sympathy for landlords, and his dissatisfaction with the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. He expressed his determination to break with these erroneous thoughts. Shen Zhiping, a member of the Jiusan Society and Director of the Nutrition Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, confessed to more than a dozen erroneous thoughts at the meeting. He said that he was unwilling to comprehensively consider the Party's leadership and the great achievements of construction, but instead seized on certain shortcomings and even exaggerated them, resulting in serious dissatisfaction with the Party. He mistakenly believed that the Party could only provide leadership in scientific organization and not lead scientific research. Li Yizan, a member of the China National Democratic Construction Association and Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy, said that he was a capitalist and had a resistant attitude towards the Party's policies on the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and tax policies. He expressed his determination to thoroughly transform himself, cut off the tumor, and cure himself of this "gentleman on the beam" who grew up in an exploitative life.

The meeting unanimously adopted a letter of determination to confess to the Party, and handed this letter to Zhang Youyu, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party, on the spot. Nearly ten thousand people attended today's meeting.

    化三心二意为一心一意
    北京市民主党派、民主人士向党交心
    新华社10日讯　北京市各民主党派、无党派民主人士今天在中山公园音乐堂举行向党交心大会。
    民革北京市委主任委员蒋光鼐宣布开会以后，民盟北京市委主任委员吴晗致词说：北京市各民主党派、无党派民主人士已经进入一般整风阶段。进行政治立场的改造，最重要的是要毫无保留地把心交给党，交给人民。这是自我改造的根本前提。吴晗说：全国人民以万马奔腾之势向前跃进，我们北京市各民主党派成员和无党派民主人士，一定要痛下决心，改造自己，急起直追，迎头赶上，把内心里见不得人的肮脏东西毫无保留地交出来，化三心二意为一心一意，把几万个心结成一个心，把这个心交给共产党，坚决跟着共产党走。
    在今天会上发言的有各民主党派的十几个成员，他们把几年来从不暴露的错误思想初步谈了出来。民革成员、国务院参事楚溪春说，解放以来，他对共产党、对社会主义不即不离、三心二意，认为今天的天下没有他的份了，所以没有主人翁的感觉。楚溪春在谈了他对土改、镇反、肃反、抗美援朝、反右派等运动的错误思想以后说：今天我将我丑恶的心初步挖出来，今后要继续挖，争取心情愉快地过好社会主义这一关。民盟成员、清华大学副校长陈士骅说，由于资产阶级个人主义拖后腿，使他长期同党不一条心，对党交给的任务是“‘愉快’地接受，被动地完成；表面轻松，内心沉重；满口承当，一肚子怨气”。陈士骅用许多具体思想情况说明他不满意党领导学校的方针、方法，怀疑党改造知识分子的政策，他表示要破除一切顾虑，进一步把满口袋脏东西抖落干净，丢下包袱，轻装前进。民进成员、教育部小学教育司司长吴研因详细地谈到了他对杜威的反动的实用主义教育没有彻底放弃和同情地主、不满意肃反等错误思想，他表示决心要和这些错误思想决裂。九三成员、中国科学院营养研究室主任沈治平在会上交了十几条错误思想，他说他不肯全面考虑党的领导和伟大的建设成就，而对于某些缺点抓住不放，甚至加以夸大，因而对党产生严重不满，他错误地认为党只能在科学组织上加以领导，不能领导科学研究。民建成员、北京市农林水利局副局长李贻赞说他是一个资本家，对党改造资本主义工商业的政策、税收政策有抵触情绪。他表示要彻底改造，割掉毒瘤，治好他这个从剥削生活中成长起来的“梁上君子”。
    大会一致通过了向党交心的决心书，并且当场把这份决心书交给了中共北京市委书记处书记张友渔。出席今天大会的有近一万人。
