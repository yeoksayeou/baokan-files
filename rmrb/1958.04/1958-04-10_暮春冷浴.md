    Late Spring Cold Bath
    Yue Wen

    The Analects contain the following passage: "In late spring, after the spring clothes are made, let five or six adults and six or seven children bathe in the Yi River, enjoy the breeze at the Dance Altar, and return home singing." After reading this, one can almost see a group of young people swimming and playing in the green river water, walking ashore, happily humming unknown songs, and embarking on their way home. Some believe that this is a scene of Confucius' disciples bathing in the wild more than two thousand years ago.

    The late spring mentioned in the Analects is equivalent to the second month of the lunar calendar now. The weather in February is still very cold, so can you go to the river to take a bath? Yes, you can. According to reports, some people in the Soviet Union can even bathe in icy water in the dead of winter!

    Doesn't the body's heat dissipate a lot when bathing in cold water? The opposite is true. When the skin comes into contact with cold water, the blood vessels in the skin contract, and the blood flow decreases accordingly, so the heat carried away by the blood is naturally less. At the same time, the sweat glands almost completely stop secreting, which also greatly prevents heat dissipation. Therefore, the loss of heat is very limited. When you get out of the bath, after appropriate friction with a dry towel, the blood vessels dilate, and the skin immediately turns red, making you feel warm all over, full of energy, and particularly energetic.

    At the beginning of a cold water bath, you may feel some discomfort due to the cold stimulation. However, this discomfort is very short-lived and will disappear completely once you get used to it. What is important is that cold stimulation can excite the nerves and increase the activity of the lungs and heart. No wonder Confucius' disciples "returned home singing" after "bathing in the Yi River and enjoying the breeze at the Dance Altar." One thing that must be mentioned here is that Wang Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty believed that the meaning of "enjoying the breeze at the Dance Altar" was to let the wind dry the water on the body. If this is the case, then it should be criticized. Because after a cold bath, you need to dry your body immediately (if you are bathing indoors, you should also close the doors and windows). If you let the wind blow, it is easy to catch a cold.

    Cold water baths can also speed up blood circulation, and the amount of oxygen obtained by the tissues of the body increases accordingly, allowing waste to be completely eliminated. In addition, the exercise during the bath and the friction after the bath allow the various tissues and organs of the body to be properly active. Due to these effects, cold water baths can also treat diseases. It has significant effects on treating neurasthenia, skin diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, heart disease, etc.

    Cold water baths should be taken every morning, and the duration should be ten to fifteen minutes each time. In the hot days of summer and autumn, you can bathe in the river. In spring and winter, you have to do it indoors. When starting, the water can be warmer (20℃), and then gradually lower the temperature until you use completely cold water (about 6℃). People with poor health or illness should take cold water baths according to medical advice.

    暮春冷浴
    曰文
    论语上有这样一段记载：“莫春者，春服既成，冠者五六人，童子六七人，浴乎沂，风乎舞雩，咏而归”。读过之后，仿佛看到有一些青少年，三五成群地在碧油油的河水里游泳、嬉戏，走上岸来，愉快地哼着不知名的歌子，踏上归途。有人认为：这就是二千多年前孔子的门徒野浴时的情景。
    论语所说的暮春，相当于现在农历的二月。二月的天气还很冷，难道就可以到河里去洗澡吗？可以的。据报载，苏联有人竟能在严冬的冰水中沐浴哩！
    用冷水沐浴，身体的热量不是会大量发散吗？事实正好相反。当皮肤接触冷水的时候，皮肤里面的血管就会收缩，通过的血液也随着减少，因此被血液带出来的热量自然就不多了。同时汗腺又差不多完全停止了分泌，这也大大防止了热量的发散。所以损失的热量是很有限的。等到出浴的时候，经干毛巾适当地摩擦，血管才行扩张，于是皮肤随即发红，只觉得全身暖呼呼地，浑身是力，精神特别饱满。
    在冷水浴开始的时候，由于冷的刺激，会感到一些不适。但这种不适，时间很短，养成习惯以后，就会完全消失。重要的是冷的刺激可以兴奋神经，增加肺和心脏的活动力。无怪乎孔子的门徒在“浴乎沂，风乎舞雩”以后，要“咏而归”了。这里有一点必须附带一提的，就是“风乎舞雩”这句话，东汉的王充认为它的意义是让风把身上的水吹干。如果真是这样，那倒是应该批判的。因为在冷浴以后，立即需要擦干身体（如在室内沐浴，还应该闭上门窗）。如果让风来吹，那是很容易感冒的。
    冷水浴以后还能使血液循环加快，身体各部组织所得到的氧气随着增多，使废物能彻底排除，再加以浴时的运动和浴后的摩擦，体内各组织器官能得到适当的活动。由于这种种作用，所以冷水浴又可以治病。对于医治神经衰弱、皮肤病、肠胃病、心脏病等，都有显著的效果。
    冷水浴宜于在每天早晨进行，每次持续的时间以十分到十五分钟为度。夏秋炎热的日子，可以在河水中沐浴，春冬的季节，就只好在室内举行了。初习时，水可以用较温（20℃）的，以后逐渐降低温度，以至于完全用冷水（6℃左右）。身体不好或有病的人要洗冷水浴，应照医嘱。
