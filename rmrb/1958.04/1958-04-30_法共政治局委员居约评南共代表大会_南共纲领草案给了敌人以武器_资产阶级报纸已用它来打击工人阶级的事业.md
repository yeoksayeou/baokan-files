Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 28th. The French Communist Party's newspaper "l'Humanité" published an article on the 28th written by Raymond Guyot, a member of the Politburo of the French Communist Party, titled "On the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia," the full text of which is as follows:

    The situation of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, as reported by "l'Humanité," has raised a series of major ideological and political questions for the international workers' and communist movement, and thus for our party as well. The bourgeois and socialist newspapers, which have been lying in wait, have seized upon several points elaborated at the Ljubljana Congress in an attempt to prove the correctness of their policies and to attack the cause of workers' unity.

    As everyone knows, the main purpose of the congress was to adopt the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. A few days before the opening of the congress of our Yugoslav comrades, they sent us the full text of this draft program.

    This draft program not only discusses issues concerning national political and economic construction within the purview of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, but also other issues related to the entire international communist movement, issues that concern the principles of Marxism-Leninism. In addition, the preface emphasizes that the draft program expresses principled views on certain major issues concerning the contemporary international workers' movement and the development of world socialism. Speaking of which, it concerns us, especially because the analysis of the international situation in the Yugoslav document differs fundamentally from the assessment made by our party.

    What is primarily surprising in the analysis of the international situation is the complete absence of any mention of class contradictions and the existence of the socialist camp and the imperialist camp, which, in our view, are fundamental factors. This throws a veil over the grave realities of the world—the confrontation between the forces of imperialist war and the forces of peace led by socialist countries—making it impossible to clearly understand the profound causes of war and the simple fact of who is responsible for the current international tension.

    The draft program speaks generally of imperialism, saying that it is a scourge. However, there is no mention of U.S. imperialism, yet everyone knows the role that U.S. imperialism plays on the international stage and its designs. This program also does not contain the facts pointed out in the Peace Declaration. This declaration was signed last November in Moscow by representatives of sixty-four parties, including the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, during the celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The declaration clearly pointed out: The leaders of the imperialist countries, under the pressure of monopoly capitalists, especially U.S. monopoly capitalists, have rejected measures aimed at reducing armaments, banning nuclear weapons, and other measures sufficient to avoid the threat of a new war. This nakedly demonstrates that imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, should be held responsible, and this is extremely important for correctly guiding the people of all countries in taking action to safeguard peace.

    However, by setting aside class contradictions and the existence of the socialist camp and the imperialist camp, one inevitably and indiscriminately makes the "great powers" responsible for international tension. This narrative is inconsistent with the reality of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and socialist countries, whose policies are not and cannot be the kind of bloc politics or the policy of dividing the world into spheres of influence as described in the draft program. Similarly, we also object to comparing the relations between countries within the socialist camp with the relations that exist within the imperialist camp. In the section describing the international situation, the words imperialism and "hegemonism" appear repeatedly, saying that these are the roots of international tension. And as the exposition gradually becomes more specific, it even considers the Soviet Union to be responsible. Needless to say, this part of the draft program, which contains such serious errors, is greatly at odds with the beliefs and feelings of communists in various countries, and thus with the feelings of the working class who are waging a difficult struggle against imperialist forces.

    From this we can see what kind of conclusions can be drawn when people set aside class contradictions. But this is also the case in other aspects. In the part of the draft program that discusses the role of capitalist countries, the following definition is given: "The state has become a necessary factor for the basic economic development of society. The state increasingly supervises capital, partially restricts the right of private management of capitalist property, and deprives private capital owners of certain independent functions in the economy and society." After giving this definition of the role of the state, it goes on to say that the state increasingly supervises capital, that monopoly capital groups increasingly lose their freedom of action, and that the state and the state machine also obtain their own independent economic basis, etc., thus giving rise to the claim that the bourgeois state seems to have become a "regulator of labor relations and property relations." All these statements have a unique shortcoming: they ignore the class nature of the bourgeois state. This error also causes the same kind of confusion in other principled issues mentioned in the draft program.

    Therefore, after understanding these highly problematic ideas, we have reason to take a completely reserved attitude when the draft program affirmatively says that "Marxist ideas have lagged behind the development of modern society in recent decades."

    Under these circumstances, although the Politburo of our party had originally accepted the invitation of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia to send a delegation to the Seventh Congress, after studying this program, it had to change its decision and abandon its planned delegation. In our letter of April 18, we emphasized to our Yugoslav comrades that the attendance of our party's delegation could be wrongly interpreted as an endorsement of the views expressed in the draft program, and that once our delegation raised the criticisms we deemed necessary at the Congress, it would then lead to polemics that we considered inappropriate. This kind of polemic might hinder the necessary criticism of certain views expounded in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in the future. For these reasons, and considering not to do anything that might make the relationship between our two parties (which had improved, especially since our meeting in Belgrade a year ago) more difficult, our Politburo, based on new facts, like other communist and workers' parties, made the above-mentioned decision of opposition, and this decision was made in a spirit of absolute fidelity to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

### 法共政治局委员居约评南共代表大会  南共纲领草案给了敌人以武器  资产阶级报纸已用它来打击工人阶级的事业

    法共政治局委员居约评南共代表大会
    南共纲领草案给了敌人以武器
    资产阶级报纸已用它来打击工人阶级的事业
    新华社巴黎28日电　法国共产党机关报“人道报”28日刊载了法共政治局委员雷蒙·居约写的文章：“关于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表大会”，全文如下：
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会的情况，“人道报”已作了报道，大会向国际工人运动和共产主义运动、因而也向我们党提出了一系列重大的、属于意识形态和政治性质的问题。一直在伺机而动的资产阶级和社会党报纸，便抓住卢布尔雅那大会所阐述的几个论点，企图借以证明它们的政策的正确和打击工人团结的事业。
    大家知道，代表大会工作的主要目的是通过南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领。在我们南斯拉夫同志的代表大会开幕的前几天，他们便把这一纲领草案的全文送给我们了。
    这个纲领草案不只是谈到仅仅涉及属于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟职权范围内的国家政治经济建设问题，而且也还谈到有关整个国际共产主义运动的其他问题，而这些问题是涉及马克思列宁主义原则的。此外，序言中还强调指出，纲领草案中对有关当代国际工人运动和世界社会主义发展的某些重大问题，表达了原则性的见解。谈到这里，也就关系到我们了，这特别是因为南斯拉夫的文件对于国际局势的分析同我们党所作的估计有根本的差别。
    对国际局势的分析首先使人惊奇的，就是完全没有提到阶级矛盾以及社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营的存在，而在我们看来，这些都是根本的因素。这就给世界的严重实际情况——帝国主义战争势力同以社会主义国家为首的和平力量对抗的情况，蒙上了一层纱幕，这显然不可能帮助人们清楚地了解有关战争的深刻原因和谁对目前国际紧张局势负责等简单的事实。
    纲领草案中一般地谈论帝国主义，说它是个祸害。但是，没有一处提到美帝国主义，然而大家知道美帝国主义在国际舞台上所起的作用和它的图谋是什么。在这个纲领中，也找不到和平宣言中指出的事实。这个宣言是去年11月在庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的时候由包括南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在内的六十四个党的代表在莫斯科签署的。这个宣言明确指出：帝国主义国家的领导人在垄断资本家、特别是美国垄断资本家的压力下，拒绝了目的在于裁减军备、禁止核武器和其他足以避免新战争威胁的措施。这就赤裸裸地表明应由帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义负责，而这一点对于正确地指导各国人民为维护和平而采取行动是极为重要的。
    但是，人们把阶级矛盾以及社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营的存在撇开不谈，这就势必要不加区别地使
  “大国”对国际紧张局势负责，这种叙述是不符合苏联和社会主义国家外交政策的实际情况的，它们的政策不是、也不可能是纲领草案中所说的那种集团政策或把世界划分成势力范围的政策。同样，我们也反对把社会主义阵营内各国之间的关系同帝国主义阵营内存在的关系相提并论。在阐述国际形势的部分中，一再出现帝国主义和“霸权主义”等字样，说这是造成国际紧张局势的根源。而阐述逐渐具体时，竟然认为苏联也应负责。不用说，错误如此严重的这一部分纲领草案，是同各国共产党人的信念和感情大大抵触的，因而也是同我们正在同帝国主义势力进行艰苦斗争的工人阶级的感情大大抵触的。
    从这里我们可以看出，当人们把阶级矛盾撇开不谈时便会得出怎样的结论。但是，在其他方面也是如此。在纲领草案谈到资本主义国家作用的一部分中，人们下了这样一个定义：“国家成为社会基本经济发展的必要因素。国家日益监督资本，部分地限制私人管理资本主义财产的权利，并剥夺私人资本所有者在经济和社会中的某些独立职能。”在给国家的作用下了这一定义以后接着说，国家日益监督资本，垄断资本集团日益丧失它们的行动自由，国家和国家机器也获得到自己的独立的经济基础，等等，从而产生这样的主张：资产阶级国家似乎已经变成“劳动关系和财产关系的调节者”。所有这些说法有一个独特的缺点：无视了资产阶级国家的阶级性。这一错误也在纲领草案中谈到的其他原则性问题上引起了同样的乱混。
    因此，在了解了这些大成问题的思想之后，当纲领草案肯定地说“近几十年来马克思主义思想落后于现代社会的发展了”的时候，我们就有理由完全采取保留态度。
    在这种情况下，我们党的政治局虽然本来已经接受了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟关于派代表团出席第七次代表大会的邀请，但在研究这一纲领之后，便不得不改变它的决定，不得不放弃预定的派代表团的打算。我们在4月18日的那封信中向我们的南斯拉夫同志强调指出，我们党的代表团的出席，可能被错误地解释为赞成纲领草案中阐述的观点，而一旦我们代表团在代表大会上提出我们认为必要的批评时，接着就会引起我们认为不适宜的论战，这种论战可能妨害将来对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案中阐述的某些观点开展必要的批评。由于这些原因，并考虑到不要做出可能使我们两党之间的关系（这种关系特别是自从一年前我们在贝尔格莱德会谈后已有改善）更加困难的做法，所以我们政治局根据新的事实，像其他共产党和工人党一样，作出了上述表示反对的决定，而且这一决定是根据绝对忠实于马克思列宁主义原则和无产阶级国际主义的精神作出的。
