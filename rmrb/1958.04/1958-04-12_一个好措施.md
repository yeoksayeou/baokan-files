    A Good Measure
    Lin Bi
    In the great leap forward of the literary and art circles, many art performance groups in cities such as Shanghai and Beijing have proposed quite considerable figures for theatrical works. However, how to achieve these targets is a matter of great concern and exploration for each unit. The practice of the Shanghai People's Art Theatre of taking the mass line to engage in collective creation provides experience worth referencing.
    Today, our professional creative forces are not yet strong enough, so it is absolutely necessary to fully rely on and give play to the amateur creative forces in various units. Most comrades of the Shanghai People's Art Theatre participated in the "Double-Anti" movement at the grassroots level, conducted research with the masses, and used the advanced figures, advanced deeds, and the issues of greatest concern to the masses in the movement as themes to compile scripts, and then helped amateur theater groups stage them. These performances not only enlivened the cultural life of the masses and solved the shortage of scripts for amateur theater groups; more importantly, they promptly publicized the Party's policies and promoted the development of the movement. On the other hand, these large numbers of new scripts, after being tested by amateur theater groups in continuous performances among the masses and after the authors continuously processed and improved them, some can become more mature repertoire for performance, thereby gradually prospering theatrical creation.
    What is also worth mentioning is that the Shanghai People's Art Theatre has fixed these amateur creators' base points among the masses, so that their creation, tutoring, labor training, and making friends with workers are carried out in the same place. This solves the past contradiction between work and tutoring, as well as labor training, and is more beneficial to work and ideological reform.
    At present, many art groups are taking various measures based on their different conditions to achieve the targets of creative leap forward. We believe that through everyone's efforts, we will definitely create more and better experiences.

    一个好措施
    林碧
    在文艺界的跃进中，上海、北京等城市许多艺术表演团体，提出了相当可观的剧作数字。但是，究竟怎样来实现这些指标，却是每个单位目前都很关心和正在摸索的问题。上海人民艺术剧院走群众路线搞集体创作的做法，提供了值得参考的经验。
    今天，我们的专业创作队伍还不够壮大，因此，充分地依靠和发挥各单位中的业余创作力量，是完全必要的。上海人民艺术剧院的大多数同志，参加到基层的双反运动中，和群众一起进行研究，把运动中的先进人物、先进事例和群众最关心的事情作为题材，编成剧本，然后帮助业余剧团上演。这些演出不仅活跃了群众的文化生活，解决了业余剧团的剧本荒；更重要的是，及时地宣传了党的政策，推动了运动的开展。另一方面，这些大批出现的新剧本，经过业余剧团在群众中不断演出的考验，和作者不断加工提高，有的便能成为较成熟的上演剧目，从而也就逐步繁荣了戏剧创作。
    还值得提出来的是，上海人民艺术剧院固定了这些业余创作人员在群众中的基点，使他们的创作、辅导、劳动锻炼，以及和工人交朋友同在一处进行。这就解决了过去曾经发生过的工作和辅导，以及劳动锻炼的矛盾，更有益于工作和思想改造。
    目前，许多艺术团体正根据各自不同的条件，采取多种多样的措施来实现创作跃进的指标。我们相信，经过大家的努力，一定能创造出更多更好的经验。
