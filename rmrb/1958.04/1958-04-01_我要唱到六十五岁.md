    I Want to Sing Until I'm Sixty-Five
    Lang Yuxiu
    When the Party Central Committee proposed the call to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more, China's industrial and agricultural production accelerated by leaps and bounds. How could I not be moved by this! Thinking about myself, I let the time slip away casually before liberation, and I haven't fully contributed my strength to the people since liberation. Realizing that today is right and yesterday was wrong, I must now make a plan to catch up.

    The rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle have given me profound education and inspiration. In the old society, I blindly worshiped Western music and didn't know the richness and beauty of national folk music. Only after liberation did I gradually realize its advantages, and I deeply feel that I can't learn enough in my whole life. In this socialist leap forward, I am determined to learn more from national folk music so that the second half of my life can better serve the broad masses. How can one say that they love their country if they don't understand or love national folk music! In formulating my leap forward plan, I am determined to learn from the national and folk music traditions and sing for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only in this way can I show that I am a true singer of the Chinese people. And only by singing more for the workers, peasants, and soldiers can I obtain true national artistic expression skills.

    In the old society, our profession was not valued. I remember in 1937, I received a letter from a classmate from elementary school whom I had not seen for many years. He kindly advised me not to engage in this profession because singing was something people played with. At that time, I was unconvinced, thinking that people were appreciating my singing art, so I was so angry that I ignored him. After liberation, under the education of the Party, I clearly realized that singing in the old society was indeed serving a small number of bourgeoisie. Before liberation, holding a concert required asking for favors to proceed smoothly. I remember when I held a concert in Suzhou in the year of the victory against Japan, two Kuomintang bandit soldiers came and asked me to participate in their party. I didn't agree, and they said fiercely, "Don't think you can continue to hold concerts in Suzhou!" I will never forget that I performed for them with tears in my eyes that day. Now it is completely different. The country has invested so much manpower and financial resources for the people's musical and cultural life. We are singing about great socialism, for the majority of people, for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This singing comes from the bottom of our hearts. Therefore, I long to sing for socialism and for the working people for the rest of my life; if my health permits, I will never step down before I am sixty-five years old.

    我要唱到六十五岁
    郎毓秀
    当党中央提出争取在十五年或者更多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他主要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国这一号召后，我国的工农业生产一日千里地加速前进，我怎能不为之动心！想想自己，解放前让光阴随便地溜过去了，解放以来也没有将自己的力量全部贡献给人民。觉今是而昨非，现在必须订出规划迎头赶上。
    整风和反右派斗争，使我受到了深刻的教育和启发。我在旧社会时盲目的崇拜西洋音乐，不知道民族民间音乐的丰富和美丽，解放后才渐渐认识了它的优点，深切感到一辈子也学不尽。在这社会主义大跃进中，我决心要更多的向民族民间音乐学习，使我这后半辈子能更好地为广大群众服务。对民族民间音乐不懂、不爱，怎么说得上是爱自己的国家呢！我在制订跃进规划中，下定决心向民族、民间的音乐传统学习，为广大的工农兵演唱，这样才能表明我是个真正的中国人民的歌唱者。也只有多为工农兵演唱，我才能得到真正的民族艺术的表现技能。
    在旧社会里，学我们这个行道是不被人们重视的。记得1937年间，我得到离别多年的小学时的同学的一封信，友谊的劝我不要搞这一行，因为歌唱是被人们玩弄的。当时我不服气，认为人家在欣赏我的歌唱艺术，因此气得我不理睬他了。解放后，在党的教育下，我明确地认识了在旧社会里歌唱，确实是为少数的资产阶级服务的。解放前举行一次音乐会，也得求人说情才能顺利进行。记得抗日胜利那年，我在苏州开音乐会时，来了两位国民党匪军，要我参加他们的晚会，我没有答应他们，他们就气势汹汹地说：“你休想继续在苏州开音乐会！”我一辈子也忘不了自己那天含着泪给他们演出。现在完全不同了，国家为了人民的音乐文化生活投了多么大的人力财力。我们是在歌唱伟大的社会主义，为多数人，为广大的工农兵群众歌唱，这歌唱是由心底里发出的。因此，我渴望着终身为社会主义、为劳动人民歌唱；若是身体许可，不满六十五岁我决不下台。（转载“四川日报”）（附图片）
