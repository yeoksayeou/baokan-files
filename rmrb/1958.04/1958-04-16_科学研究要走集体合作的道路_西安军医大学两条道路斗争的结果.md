Scientific Research Should Take the Road of Collective Cooperation
The Result of the Struggle Between Two Lines at Xi'an Military Medical University

(Our Dispatch) According to a report in the Shaanxi Daily: Xi'an Military Medical University, in carrying out scientific research work, has conducted a struggle between two roads. Those who adhere to the road of collective cooperation and face reality have quickly achieved remarkable results and received strong support from the school leadership. Therefore, more and more people at this school are taking the collective road for scientific research. There are three forms of collective cooperation they are undertaking: one is collective research within a teaching and research section; one is cooperation between several teaching and research sections; and the other is cooperation with relevant units outside the school.

The Biochemistry Teaching and Research Section of the school, for example, has always adhered to the road of collective cooperation and facing reality. Professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants in this teaching and research section have a close division of labor. There is a clear division of labor between and within each research group, and they also conduct regular collective research. Professor Su Chengzhi, the head of the teaching and research section, had already achieved certain achievements in the research of vitamin P, but in order to lead all comrades in the section to develop and improve scientific research, he handed over vitamin P to two lecturers to continue the research. In addition to guiding the research work of the entire section, he also led a teaching assistant to research vitamin C. Now they have extracted vitamin P from orange peels, Sophora japonica, and tea leaves, and have also achieved certain results in observing and studying the effects of this vitamin in animals. They have also measured the content of various vitamins in more than 80 kinds of food in the Xi'an area, achieving important results. And it scientifically proved that Shaanxi Province is currently planting and developing a large number of walnut trees, which has great economic value. The Microbiology Teaching and Research Section of this school also cooperated with more than a dozen medical units in the Xi'an area to study the source of epidemic encephalitis B. Due to the joint efforts of many parties, the source of encephalitis B and the epidemic area in the Northwest region have been identified, and the treatment and prevention in the Xi'an area have been greatly improved, greatly reducing the mortality rate. Due to collective cooperation, the entire group of 20 people in this teaching and research section has written 20 scientific papers in the past two years, including 11 scientific papers collectively written by teaching assistants and technicians. This year, the projects and scope of collective cooperation in scientific research in the school have been further developed and expanded. There are major topics of cooperative research between teaching and research sections within the school alone, such as dental caries and periodontal disease, radiation sickness, surgical treatment of cardiovascular diseases, neurosurgery, and epidemic diseases (including colds and dysentery). Each topic has at least four teaching and research sections working together, such as the research on radiation sickness, which has ten teaching and research sections cooperating.

However, a considerable number of people in the school have serious bourgeois ideas of personal fame and gain, and are unwilling to cooperate with others, but take the road of individual work. These people regard knowledge as personal private property and scientific research as a means for individuals to gain fame and gain. For example, some people are unwilling to let others know the materials they know, some people are unwilling to make the topics public, and conduct research or experiments secretly, and some people want to take shortcuts and are unwilling to work hard. People who take this road have not achieved much in research. Not only is the efficiency low, but it also restricts the development of scientific research. For example, several research topics in the Department of Internal Medicine last year were similar, and others suggested that they cooperate to study them, but they were unwilling to take out the little bits and pieces of information they possessed, and without cooperation, none of them came up with results.

In order to implement the socialist direction in scientific research, the Party and administrative leaders of Xi'an Military Medical University vigorously supported teachers who took the collective road, and constantly conducted ideological education on the struggle between the two lines in scientific research through examples. During the rectification movement, the school also organized all teachers to conduct a special debate on the issue of the two roads in scientific research, and formulated a plan to improve scientific research. In this plan and the "Three-Year Hard Work to Change the Face of the School Twenty-Three Leap Forward Plan," the socialist collective direction of scientific research was clearly stipulated.

### 科学研究要走集体合作的道路  西安军医大学两条道路斗争的结果

    科学研究要走集体合作的道路
    西安军医大学两条道路斗争的结果
    本报讯　据陕西日报报道：西安军医大学，在开展科学研究工作中，进行了两条道路的斗争。
    西安军医大学自1955年有计划地开展科学研究工作以来，就展开了两条道路、两种方法的斗争。坚持走集体合作、面向实际道路的，很快取得显著成绩、得到学校领导上的大力支持。因此，这个学校走集体道路进行科学研究的人越来越多了。他们进行集体合作的形式有三种：一种是教研室内的集体研究；一种是几个教研室之间的合作；另一种是与校外有关单位合作。
    该校生物化学教研室，就是一直坚持了集体合作、面向实际的道路。这个教研室的教授、讲师、助教都进行了密切的分工。各研究小组之间和小组内部，既有明确分工，又经常集体研究。教研室负责人苏成芝教授原来研究维生素P已有一定成就，但是他为了领导全室同志发展和提高科学研究，就把维生素P交给两个讲师继续研究。自己除指导全室研究工作外，还带一个助教研究维生素C。现在他们已从桔子皮、槐米、茶叶中提取出维生素P，在观察研究这种维生素在动物体内的作用方面，也取得一定成绩。他们还测定了西安地区八十多种食物中各种维生素的含量，取得了重要成绩。并且从科学上证明了陕西省正在大量种植发展核桃树，有很大的经济价值。这个教研室的微生物教研室还和西安地区十多个医务单位合作研究流行性乙型脑炎的病源，由于多方面共同协作，已经摸清楚西北地区乙型脑炎的病源和发病区，并且使西安地区在治疗和预防上有了很大改进，大大减少了死亡率。这个教研室由于集体合作，两年来，全组二十个人就写出二十篇科学论文，其中助教和技术员集体写的科学论文就有十一篇。今年该校在科学研究上集体合作的项目和范围，更加发展和扩大了，仅校内教研室之间合作研究的较大专题就有龋病与牙周病、放射病、心脏血管疾患外科治疗法、脑神经外科、流行性病（包括感冒、痢疾）等。每个专题最少都有四个教研室合作研究，如合作研究放射病的就有十个教研室。
    但是，该校也有相当一部分人，有着严重的资产阶级个人名利思想，不愿意与别人合作，而走个人单干的道路。这些人把知识当作个人的私有财产，把科学研究当作个人获得名利的手段。如有的人自己知道的材料不愿让别人知道，有的人连题目也不愿公开，偷着进行研究或实验，有的人想走捷径，不愿刻苦钻研。走这条道路的人，研究成绩都不大，不但效率低，而且束缚着科学研究的发展。如内科教研室去年有几个研究题目都相近，别人建议他们合作起来研究，但他们都不愿把自己占有的一点零碎材料拿出来，没有合作，几个人都没有研究出结果来。
    西安军医大学的党、政领导，为了在科学研究上贯彻社会主义方向，大力支持走集体道路的教师，曾通过实例不断地向教师进行科学研究上两条路线斗争的思想教育。整风运动中，还组织全校教师对科学研究上的两条道路问题进行了专题辩论，并制订了改进科学研究的方案，在这个方案和“苦战三年改变学校面貌的二十三条跃进规划”中，都明确规定了科学研究的社会主义集体方向。
