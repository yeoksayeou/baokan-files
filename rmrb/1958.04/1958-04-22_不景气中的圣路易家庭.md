    A St. Louis Family in Recession
    Editor's note: The following is an excerpt of a report by Dixon Terry, a reporter for the Missouri-based "St. Louis Post-Dispatch," published on March 9. Through the tragic experiences of these unemployed American workers, people can more concretely see the profound disaster that the American economic crisis has brought to the broad masses of working people.
    This father is forty-one years old and has five children, the oldest thirteen and the youngest three. Two weeks ago, he experienced an almost unbearable pain: his children had nothing to eat for two whole days.
    He had picked up some beer and soda bottles on the streets and highways, washed them, and sold them for a few cents to buy some milk.
    Then he went to the Salvation Army to ask for help. This was the first time in his life that he had had to beg. It was a very difficult decision to make, but there was really no other way. He couldn't bear to watch his children starve any longer.
    This is one of the more than a thousand families of unemployed people in St. Louis, families where the breadwinner is out of work, unable to find a job, and not eligible for state relief or unemployment benefits. These families are almost destitute.
    During my days of visits, I saw families with nothing to eat, babies and young children without even milk to drink, and no fuel for heating.
    In many cases, they receive help from relatives and neighbors. Some families receive assistance from the Salvation Army (Editor's note: a religious relief organization). But the recent wave of unemployment, especially among factory workers and unskilled workers, has exhausted the organization's funds.
    Last month, the Salvation Army spent $4,446 on direct relief, which was $700 over its budget. Even so, 40% of applicants were turned away in disappointment.
    The father of five who spoke with us was a construction worker with ten years of experience.
    He was laid off in October, leaving the construction work he had been doing. So he started looking for tree-felling work, but couldn't find any. He looked for any other work, but there was nothing.
    He said, "I went out to rake leaves, clear ditches, I did everything to make a living and buy some food for my family."
    But even such work is not plentiful, and feeding five children requires a lot of food.
    By November, things were even worse, and he had to sell his truck, even though the truck was almost indispensable for finding tree-felling work again. But he had to buy food. Later, he also sold the last tool he could use to make a living on his own - a saw.
    He had bought a house worth $2,800 on an installment plan, paying $50 a month. Now he is two months behind on payments. A week ago, he worked for a day with another tree-feller and earned ten dollars. But he owed thirty-four dollars in electricity bills, so he had to pay ten dollars for electricity first to prevent the power company from cutting off his power.
    All five children stayed at home, even though four of them were of school age. The two youngest had no shoes and had to go barefoot.
    He has applied for jobs in a dozen places, responded to recruitment advertisements, and walked the streets looking for work. The Salvation Army gave his family two free meals. He said, "We don't know what to do next. They said they can only help us with one more meal."
    His wife stood in the kitchen doorway, arms crossed, with a look of fear and despair in her eyes. She said, "I don't know what we'll eat after this week?"
    There is an old man of fifty-three in north St. Louis, named Harold Hamilton. He walked around all day looking for work to no avail, and now sits in the kitchen. He has a wife and five sons. The sons range in age from five to fifteen.
    Hamilton worked for a storm window installation company for twelve years, installing doors and windows. He has been unemployed since last November. What about his unemployment benefits?
    He said, "That's exactly my problem. They say I'm not eligible to apply for unemployment benefits. Because I have my own truck, I'm not considered employed, because I install windows for them under contract. And even if you are eligible for unemployment benefits, you can't even take a day's wages, or you're not eligible. Sir, I'd rather make a living by working, even if it's just one day a week. I've been supporting my family for many years."
    He took a piece of paper from a nail on the kitchen wall. "These are some of the places I've been trying to find work." On this piece of paper were written the names of nineteen factories and other plants. These factories have all been crossed out one by one. He said, "They were all very polite, but there was nothing they could do."
    He has to pay thirty dollars a month in rent, but he is far behind. How much does it take to feed his family?
    He said, "It depends on what you mean. There's one way of eating that's just to stay alive, and there's another way of sitting down and really eating. We're just staying alive now. Beans, oatmeal, macaroni, that's all there is to eat. The kids love milk, but we had to stop drinking milk. They also like butter, but they don't get to see much of it."
    He didn't want to say how much he owed the grocery store. He admitted, "The numbers on the bill are high enough, that's for sure." Now there's not even money to buy soap.
    He said that everywhere he looked for work, there were people just like him looking for the same work. And like him, those people are running all over the city looking for temporary work.
    In Missouri, if one member of a family has the ability to work, that family is not eligible for state relief, even if that member of the family who has the ability to work cannot find a job at all.
    Unemployment benefits are mainly limited to those who have been working most of the year. Many workers, especially construction workers who switch from one job to another from time to time, are not eligible for unemployment benefits.
    In addition, the law does not require companies that employ only four or fewer workers to provide unemployment benefits to laid-off workers. This prevents even more workers from receiving unemployment insurance. Therefore, a person who is able to work but does not qualify for unemployment benefits has nowhere to turn for assistance except to private organizations.
    Among the thirty-five households in the apartment at 5502 Maple Street, fourteen households have unemployed heads of household, and their situation best illustrates the lives of those who have suffered this plight. These unemployed families have a total of nineteen children. Before the landlord discovered their plight, most of the children had no milk to drink, some had almost nothing to eat, and many adults actually went hungry for days at a time to give their meager food to their children.
    When the landlord and his wife learned of the plight of their tenants, they went out to seek relief funds. But the fathers in these families are all able to work. Only two people in this house are eligible for unemployment benefits. Everyone else is left with no recourse.
    One of them is a maintenance worker for a vending machine company. He was laid off in January. He is eligible for unemployment benefits, but had to wait two weeks. In the meantime, his money ran out and he had nothing to eat, but like many people in this predicament, he never asked for help. It wasn't until there was no milk and food for his two young children that he and his wife revealed their plight to the landlord.
    His wife told me, "I didn't even know I was going to tell someone about our situation until then, but my husband kept saying he was going to rob a grocery store to get some food for the kids."
    Another tenant is a construction worker. He told me that he had walked from this apartment on Maple Street all the way to the river, and then back from the river, looking for any work. He said, "I said I was willing to work for fifty cents an hour, just to get something for my kids to eat."
    A drill press operator was laid off six weeks ago when his employer closed down. This person said, "They didn't even have enough money to pay my wages. Fortunately, our landlord and his wife helped, or we wouldn't even have anything to eat."
    This person was driven to desperation and sold a pint of blood for five dollars to buy food. His wife went around the streets picking up soda bottles to sell for money.
    A young couple (the husband is twenty-one years old and the wife is only seventeen) has a three-month-old baby. He was laid off last June. He found work at an auto assembly plant in September, but was laid off again a month later.
    Their baby was born last November. This father's last paycheck and his savings totaled $120. He said, "I didn't dare touch this money at all. I needed every penny of it to pay the hospital bill." The hospital bill totaled $119, so the couple returned home with a baby and one dollar.
    This young man said, "We put all the money from both families together and bought a little bit of meat and vegetables and made a big pot of soup. This pot of soup was enough for us to eat for more than two days. Then we cooked some macaroni and ate that for another two or three days. But finally one day we had no food left at all. I'm not the kind of person who goes around begging, but I had to beg." (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)
    This young couple is penniless, the adults have nothing to eat, and there is no milk for the child.

### 不景气中的圣路易家庭

    不景气中的圣路易家庭
    编者按：这是美国密苏里州“圣路易邮报”3月9日登载的该报记者迪克森·台里的一篇通讯的摘要。透过这些美国失业工人的悲惨遭遇，人们可以更加具体地看到美国经济危机带给广大劳动人民的深重灾难。
    这个父亲是四十一岁，有五个孩子，最大的十三岁，最小的有三岁。两星期以前，他经历了一场几乎忍受不了的痛苦：整整两天他的孩子们没有吃到一口东西。
    他曾经到街道和公路上拣了几个啤酒瓶和汽水瓶，洗干净后卖了几文钱，买了一些牛奶。
    然后他到“救世军”去请求帮助。这是他生平第一次不得不乞求于人。这是一个很不容易作出的决定，但是实在没有其他办法可想。他不能再眼看着孩子们挨饿啊。
    这是圣路易一千多家失业者家庭之一，这些家庭中挣钱的人失业了，找不到工作，也没有资格得到国家救济金或失业补贴。这些家庭差不多赤贫了。
    在我几天的访问中，我看到了这样一些家庭：家里没有东西吃，婴儿和幼儿甚至没有牛奶喝，也没有燃料取暖。
    在许多情况下，他们得到亲友邻居的帮助。有些家庭得到“救世军”（编者注：宗教性的救济机构）的援助。但是最近的失业浪潮，特别是工厂工人和不熟练工人中间的失业浪潮，已经使得这个机构资金枯竭了。
    上月份“救世军”拿出了四千四百四十六块美元从事直接救济，这已经超过它的预算七百美元。就是这样还有40％的申请者遭到拒绝怏怏而去。
    跟我们谈话的这个五个孩子的父亲曾经是个有十年工龄的建筑工人。
    他在（去年）10月份被解雇了，离开了他一直从事的建筑工作。于是他开始寻找锯树工作，但是找不到。他寻找任何别的工作，可是什么工作也没有。
    他说，“我出去耙过树叶，清理沟渠，什么活都干，好凑和着活下去，给家里买些东西吃。”
    但是连这样的工作也不多，喂饱五个孩子却要不少粮食。
    到了11月，情况更糟了，他不得不卖掉他的卡车，虽然他想再找到锯树工作这辆卡车几乎是不可缺少的。但是他不能不买粮食啊。后来，他又把可以独立谋生的最后一件工具——锯子也卖掉了。
    他曾经用分期付款的办法买了一幢价值二千八百美元的房子，每月要付五十美元。现在他已经有两个月没有付钱了。一个星期以前，他和另外一个锯树工人一起工作了一天，挣了十块钱。但是他欠了三十四元的电费，因此不得不先付十元电费，免得电力公司断了他的电。
    五个孩子都留在家里，虽然四个孩子已经到了入学年龄。两个小的没有鞋穿，只好赤着脚。
    他到过十几个地方去申请工作，同时他也应征过招聘的广告，并且满街奔走寻找工作。“救世军”给了他家两顿免费饭。他说，“我们不知道以后怎么办，他们说他们只能再帮助我们一顿饭了。”
    他的妻子站在厨房门口，两臂交叉，眼睛里露出了恐惧和绝望的神色。她说，“我不知道过了这星期我们吃什么？”
    圣路易城北有一个五十三岁的老头儿，名叫哈罗德·哈密尔顿。他奔走一天寻找工作毫无结果，现在坐在厨房里。他有妻子，还有五个儿子。儿子的年龄从五岁到十五岁。
    哈密尔顿在一家风雨窗装置公司做了十二年安装门窗的工作。从去年11月起就失业了。他的失业补贴呢？
    他说，“这正是我的问题。他们说我不合格申请失业救济金。因为我有自己的卡车，我不算是受雇佣的，因为我是根据合同给他们安装窗子的。而且就算你够格得到失业补贴，你就得连一天的工资都不能拿，否则你就不合格了。先生，我倒宁愿靠工作来谋生，即使一星期只工作一天也好。我已经养活我的家庭好些年了。”
    他从厨房墙壁的一个钉子上取下了一张纸。“这是我曾去设法找工作的一些地方。”在这张纸条上写下了十九家工厂和其他一些厂房的名字。这些工厂都一个一个用笔划掉了。他说，“他们都非常客气，但是一点法子也没有。”
    他每月要付三十美元的房租，但是他已经拖欠很久了。要使他全家吃饱需要多少钱呢？
    他说，“这要看你怎么说了。有一种吃法是仅仅为了维持生命，还有一种是坐下来真正地吃饭。我们现在仅仅在维持生命。豆子、麦片、通心粉，就是全部的伙食。孩子们很爱喝牛奶，但是我们不得不停止喝奶。他们也喜欢黄油，但是他们不大能够看得到它了。”
    他不愿意说他欠了食品杂货店多少债。他承认，“账单上的数字高得够厉害，这一点是肯定的。”现在连买肥皂的钱都没有。
    他说，在他寻找工作的各个地方，到处都是和他一样的人在寻找同样的工作。而且像他一样，那些人也在满城奔波寻找临时工作。
    在密苏里州，一个家庭只要有一个成员有就业的能力，他这一家就不能领州的救济金，那怕他家这个有就业能力的成员根本无法找到职业。
    失业补助金主要限于那些一年大部分时间都一直有工作的人。许多工人，特别是像那些不时从一种工作调换到另一种工作的建筑工人，就没有资格领失业补助金。
    此外，法律不要求那些仅仅雇佣四个或四个以下的工人的公司给被解雇的工人失业补贴。这就使更多的工人拿不到失业保险金。因此，一个有就业能力但是不符合领取失业补贴资格的人，除了向私人机构求助以外就无处呼吁援助。
    住在枫树街五千五百零二号的一所公寓中的三十五户人家之中，有十四户的家长失业，他们的情况最能说明陷于这种遭遇的人们的生活情况。这些失业的家庭总共有十九个孩子。在房东发现他们的困苦处境以前，大多数的孩子都没有牛奶喝，有些孩子几乎没有东西吃，许多大人实际上连续几天挨饿，好把他们仅有的一点食物给孩子们吃。
    当房东和他的妻子知道了他们的房客们的困苦境况的时候，他们就出去设法请求救济金。但是这些家庭的父亲都是有就业能力的。在这所房子里只有两个人有资格得到失业补贴。其他的人就都是求助无门了。
    其中一个人是一家自动售货机公司的保养工人。他是在1月份被解雇的。他有资格领取失业补贴，但是得等待两个星期。在这期间他的钱用光了，没有东西可吃了，但是跟许多处在这种困境中的人们一样，他从来没有要求过帮助。一直到没有牛奶和食物给他的两个小孩子吃的时候，他和他的妻子才把他们的困苦情况向房东透露。
    他的妻子对我说，“一直到了那个时候我也不知道我会去把我们的情况告诉别人，可是我的丈夫一再说起要出去抢劫食品杂货店，好给孩子们一些东西吃。”
    另外一个房客是一个建筑工人。他对我说，他曾经从这所座落在枫树街的公寓一直走到河边，然后又从河边走回来，想寻找任何工作。他说，“我表示愿为每小时五角工资而工作，只要让我的孩子们有一点东西吃就成。”
    一个钻床工人是在六个星期前他的雇主歇业时被解雇的。这个人说，“他们甚至没有足够的钱来付我的工资。幸亏我们的房东和他的妻子帮忙，不然我们连饭都吃不上。”
    这个人被逼得走头无路，卖了一品脱的血，换得五块钱买食物。他的妻子在街上到处去拣汽水瓶子卖钱。
    一对年轻夫妇（丈夫二十一岁，妻子才十七岁）有一个三个月的婴儿。去年6月他被解雇了。9月他在一家汽车装配工厂找到了工作，但是一个月后又被解雇了。
    他们的婴儿是在去年11月出生的。这位父亲最后一笔工资和他的储蓄总共是一百二十美元。他说，“这一笔钱我一点都不敢动用，我需要我所有的每一分钱来支付医院的账单。”医院的账单一共是一百一十九块美元，因此这对夫妻带着一个婴儿和一块美金回到了家里。
    这位青年人说，“我们把两家所有的钱合并在一起，买一丁点肉和蔬菜，作成一大锅汤。这一锅汤够我们吃两天多。然后我们就煮些通心粉，再吃上两三天。但是终于有一天我们一点食物也没有了。我不是那种到处向人乞讨的人，但是我不得不向人求乞了。”（新华社）（附图片）
    这一对年青夫妇已经身无分文，大人没有吃的，小孩的牛奶也没有着落。
