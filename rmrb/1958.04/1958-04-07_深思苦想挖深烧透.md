The Double-Anti Movement is a component of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. It is a struggle to sweep away official airs, lethargy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, to establish socialist thought, and to strive for both redness and expertise. During the movement, science and education institutions exposed many serious problems, such as research work, the educational system, teaching methods, teaching content, academic thought, teacher conduct, and so on. These problems cannot be clarified all at once. If we want to solve these problems thoroughly in the near future, we must consider them calmly, analyze them specifically, think deeply and burn thoroughly.

Only by thinking deeply can we dig deep and burn thoroughly. After the general exposure, if we cannot think deeply, we cannot grasp the key issues, or we will grasp everything without distinction, or skim the surface without depth or thoroughness. What should we think deeply about? Generally speaking, if we can think hard about the departments, individuals, leaders, professors, lectures, speeches, and other clues we have come into contact with in recent years, many new problems will surely emerge in our minds, and a sense of responsibility for urgently solving problems will also arise. By linking these problems together, we can find the essence and thoroughly expose and criticize them. In this way, we can burn thoroughly and solve the problems completely.

    深思苦想挖深烧透
    示且
    双反运动是政治战线思想战线上的社会主义革命的一个组成部分，是扫掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气，树立社会主义思想，力争红透专深的斗争。科学教育等机关在运动中揭发暴露了不少严重问题。如研究工作、学制、教学方法、教学内容、学术思想、教师作风等等。这些问题，不是一下子可以弄清楚的。要想在不久的将来，能彻底解决问题，就要冷静地考虑，具体地分析，深思苦想，挖深烧透。
    只有深思苦想才能挖深烧透。在一般地揭发以后，如果不能深思苦想，就不能抓住关键问题，或者是眉毛胡子一把抓，或者是蜻蜓点水，不深不透。深思苦想些什么呢？从面来说，如能从几年来所接触的部门、个人、领导、教授、听课、讲话等线索去苦想的话，脑子里一定会浮现出许多新问题，也就会出现迫切要求解决问题的责任感。再把这些问题联系起来，就能找到本质，进而彻底揭发批判。这样，才能烧透，才能彻底解决问题。
