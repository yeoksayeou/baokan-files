Xinhua News Agency, April 24th – More than 1,500 young people in the capital gathered at Tsinghua University today to commemorate "April 24th Anti-Colonialism Day" and to support the anti-imperialist struggle of the youth and people of Algeria. International students from the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, India, Indonesia, and other countries studying in China, as well as student representatives from Venezuela who were invited to China by the All-China Students' Federation, also attended the meeting and spoke on behalf of their delegations.

Liu Xiyuan, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, addressed the meeting. He expressed the support of the youth of China for the struggles of their brothers and sisters in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Latin America for national independence and freedom.

Liu Xiyuan said: Chinese youth, who have forever freed themselves from imperialist oppression and enslavement, have shared similar experiences with the youth of Asian and African countries in the past. Chinese youth resolutely support the struggles of Asian and African countries against colonialism and for the attainment and safeguarding of national independence. The French government should immediately cease its criminal war, recognize the independence and freedom of the Algerian people, and release all innocent patriots. We strongly condemn the United States for consistently supporting France's crimes of slaughtering the Algerian people with large quantities of armaments and loans, and we firmly oppose the United States' conspiracy to continue enslaving and ruling the Algerian and North African peoples under the guise of "mediation."

Hu Qili, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, severely protested the atrocities of the French authorities on behalf of the students of the country, demanding the immediate cancellation of the order to dissolve the Algerian Muslim Students' Union, the immediate release of Algerian student leaders, and the release of innocent arrested Algerian patriotic young woman Jamila Bouhired.

Soviet student representative Kidarienko pointed out in his speech that colonialism is a shameful phenomenon of our modern times. Yahsin, the student representative of the United Arab Republic, said: The Asian and African nations are now a whole, and we should pay special attention to the nations that have not yet been liberated or are resisting capitalist exploitation. Venezuelan student representative Carlos Vivoba said that the day of the collapse of the entire colonial system is not far off. For thoughtful and conscious young people, there is only one slogan, which is to strive for a world that has neither colonizers nor colonized and enslaved people.

The conference concluded with the adoption of two telegrams, one addressed to the Council of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and the other to the Algerian Muslim Students' Union.

    反殖民主义力量锐不可当
    首都青年纪念亚非学生反殖民主义日
    据新华社24日讯　首都一千五百多名青年今天在清华大学集会纪念“四月二十四日反殖民主义日”，并且支援阿尔及利亚的青年和人民的反帝国主义斗争。在中国留学的苏联、阿拉伯联合共和国、印度、印度尼西亚等国的留学生和应中华全国学生联合会邀请来中国访问的委内瑞拉学生代表也参加了大会，并派代表在会上讲了话。
    中华全国青年联合会主席刘西元在会上讲话。他以全国青年的名义支持亚洲、非洲、美洲和拉丁美洲各国兄弟姐妹为民族独立和自由而进行的斗争。
    刘西元说：永远摆脱了帝国主义压迫和奴役的中国青年，在过去同亚非国家的青年都有着共同的经历和遭遇。中国青年坚决支持亚非各国反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争。法国政府应该立即停止罪恶的战争，承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立和自由，释放一切无辜的爱国者。我们强烈谴责美国一贯以大量军火和贷款支持法国屠杀阿尔及利亚人民的罪行，坚决反对美国借“斡旋”之名来继续奴役、统治阿尔及利亚和北非人民的阴谋。
    中华全国学生联合会主席胡启立在会上代表全国学生严重抗议法国当局的暴行，要求立即取消解散阿尔及利亚穆斯林学生联合会的命令，立即释放阿尔及利亚学生领袖，并且释放无辜被捕的阿尔及利亚爱国女青年加米拉·布伊海德。
    苏联留学生代表基达连柯在讲话中指出，殖民主义是我们现代耻辱的现象。阿拉伯联合共和国留学生代表雅兴说：亚非各民族现在是一个整体，我们应该特别关心至今尚未解放或正在反对资本主义压榨的民族。委内瑞拉学生代表加尔洛斯·维沃巴说，整个殖民主义制度崩溃的日子已经不远了。对于有思想有觉悟的青年人，只有一个口号，那就是争取世界成为既没有殖民者又没有被殖民奴役的人的世界。
    大会最后通过了致亚非人民团结大会理事会、致阿尔及利亚穆斯林学生联合会的两封电文。
