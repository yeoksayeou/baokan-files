    Glimpses of Dengfeng
    By our Special Correspondent Li Zhun
    In recent days, the highway from Zhengzhou to Dengfeng County has been bustling with traffic, and the visiting crowds are like a tightly wound rope. In this county, although there is the majestic Mount Song, the renowned Shaolin Temple, the Huishan Temple where the great scientist Monk Yixing lived, and the ancient Songyue Academy, the visitors have no desire to admire famous mountains or visit ancient temples, because there are even more attractive scenic spots and wonders: that is, the all-round Great Leap Forward in Dengfeng County.
    Talking about "Speed"
    Perhaps some people will ask: "This Great Leap Forward in production, which is being carried out so vigorously and so rapidly, how exactly is it being promoted so quickly?" Here, I will give a few examples of the speed.
    When building a reservoir in Wangshang Village, the masses learned that the Dongxianglan Cooperative in Lushan County had made a "small train" (wooden-wheeled handcart) for transporting earth, which saved a lot of manpower. Water conservancy committee member Song Guoxian rushed there overnight, traveling four hundred li in three days, brought back the design, and started working on it overnight. Before they had even finished it, many people had come to learn. In less than a few days, this kind of "small train" appeared on many reservoirs throughout the county.
    Take the stone mill used for grinding flour in the countryside, for example. This thing has been improved from the stone mortar, and no one knows how many thousands of years it has been around; for thousands of years it has been the same old thing. But in Tangzhuang District, the face of the mill was changed in less than ten days. Originally, there was a young man named Feng Dexiang in Sanguanmiao Village, who looked quite optimistic and seemed to have a knack for tinkering. He saw in the Youth Newspaper that Yanshi County had made a hand-cranked mill that could grind eight hundred catties of grain a day, which was equivalent to ten donkeys. On the Lantern Festival, he made an appointment with an old carpenter and ran one hundred and ten li over the mountains overnight to Yanshi County to learn. He arrived in Yanshi County at night, looked at the hand-cranked mill under the lantern light, drew the design, measured the dimensions, and immediately got up at dawn to run back. He didn't even enter his house, but started working on it with wood that night.
    Feng Dexiang didn't even bother to eat, he was rushing to make the hand-cranked mill; but before he could finish it, the district committee organized various townships to visit and learn. A day later, hand-cranked mills were being made "bang, bang, bang" in villages all over the district.
    In the Great Leap Forward, even a little experience, a little creation, would be quickly discovered, valued, and quickly disseminated and promoted. The Tangzhuang Pioneer Cooperative, based on foreign experience, created a granular fertilizer plant. In less than a month, every cooperative and team in the county had a granular fertilizer plant.
    People are competing with time at this speed, leaping forward. Now in the countryside, every day, every hour is changing the face of things, creating miracles.
    More Sanitary Than the City
    In the past, when some people mentioned the countryside, they always had a "dirty" impression first. Even those who had been to the countryside felt that it was difficult to pay attention to hygiene in the countryside. However, in this Great Leap Forward, the masses broke this old view with resolute action.
    Visiting Dengfeng County, the first impression is: "The countryside here is cleaner than the city." Here, almost every village street has been tidied up, the houses are whitewashed with lime, even the few thatched houses hidden deep in the mountains are whitewashed beautifully. In the ten villages and towns of Dengfeng County, we visited eight. What we saw in these villages and towns was that the streets were leveled, the steps on both sides were neatly and beautifully built, every household had a fire-fighting water tank and a garbage can, and the doors and windows were painted and varnished, taking on a completely new look.
    Take toilets, for example, which used to be breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, now every toilet has a lid, and the walls are newly whitewashed. Some villages even invited people who could paint to paint a few branches of peony flowers on the walls of the toilets. Therefore, many people said: "This doesn't look like a toilet at all, it looks like the scenery on a stage!"
    Before the new year, the county renovated more than 60,000 toilets and more than 50,000 kitchen stoves, basically renovating the toilets and stoves of every household in the county.
    In Daye Village, we visited several farmers' homes. In the kitchen, the stoves were all plastered white and spotless; the chopping boards were scrubbed white on both sides, the bowls had cupboards, the chopsticks had chopstick bags, and even the earthen pottery basins and flour jars were washed shiny and clean, without a speck of dust. Entering the house, the clothes and bedding were washed clean and white. Not only has the new method of delivery been implemented here for a long time, but women also have a regular system of "menstrual cards" and "pregnant women care," with a card during women's menstrual period or pregnancy when they cannot do heavy physical labor. The production team leader assigns them appropriate labor according to these cards.
    The dirtier the place, the more thorough the sanitation work is done. This is even more evident in the livestock pens here. The livestock troughs are washed very clean, and every trough, water tank, and feed tank has a lid, and the pens are always padded with soft yellow soil. With livestock hygiene, fertility has increased and diseases have decreased. In Daye Village, in 1955, the expenditure on livestock medical expenses was 879 yuan in three months; after they launched the "three diligences and five cleans" livestock hygiene campaign, the expenditure for the entire year of 1957 was only 21 yuan.
    By the end of February, Dengfeng County had eliminated 540,000 rats and 710,000 sparrows, an average of ten rats and more than ten sparrows eliminated per household.

    登封见闻
    本报特约记者　李准
    这些天来，从郑州到登封县的公路上，每天汽车来往不断，参观人群就像拧成的一股绳。在这个县里，虽然有峻奇巍峨的中岳嵩山，有久负盛名的少林古寺，有大科学家僧一行居住的会善寺和古老的嵩岳书院等名胜，但是，来参观的人们，却无心览名山，访古刹，因为还有更吸引他们美景奇事：那就是登封县的全面大跃进。
    说说“快”
    也许会有人问：“这次生产大跃进，开展得这样猛烈，这样迅速，究竟是怎样推行得这样快呢”？在这里，我举几个例子说说快的情形。
    在王上村修水库时，群众打听着鲁山县冬香兰合作社制成了运土“小火车”（木制有轨手推车），很节省人力。水利委员宋国显就连夜赶了去，三天赶了四百里，把样子弄了回来，连夜就动手做起来。在他们还没有做成的时候，已经有很多人来学习了。不到几天，全县很多水库上都出现了这种“小火车”。
    就拿农村磨面粉用的石磨来说吧，这东西从对臼窠改进后，到现在也不知道有几千年了；几千年来一直是那个老样子。可是在唐庄区，不到十天就改变了磨子的面貌。原来三官庙村有个青年叫冯德祥，样子挺乐观，看来也有个钻劲。他从青年报纸上看到偃师县做了一个手摇磨，一天一个人就能磨八百斤粮食，抵得上十头驴子。灯节那天，他约了个老木匠，连夜翻过大山跑了一百一十里，到偃师县去学习。夜里赶到偃师县，在灯下看了手摇磨，画了样子，量了尺寸，又立即起五更跑回来。他连家门也不曾进，就连夜找木料开始干。
    冯德祥连饭也顾不得吃，在赶着做手摇磨；可是还没等他做好，区委就组织各乡来参观学习。一天以后，全区各村都“砰哩砰啦”地做起手摇磨来。
    在跃进中，那怕一点经验，一点创造，都会迅速被人发现重视，迅速被传播推广。唐庄先锋社根据外地经验，制成了颗粒肥料场。在不到一个月时间内，全县社社、队队都有了颗粒肥料场。
    人们就是用这样的速度和时间竞赛着，跃进着。现在在农村，每一天、每一小时都在改变着面貌，产生着奇迹。
    比城市还卫生
    过去，有些人们一提起农村，总是先有一个“脏”的印象。就是到过农村的人，也觉得在农村讲究卫生是有困难的。但是，在这次大跃进中，群众以坚决的行动，打破了这种陈旧的看法。
    到登封县参观，首先给人的印象就是：“这里农村比城市还干净。”在这里，差不多每一个村子的街道都经过整理，房子都用石灰刷得雪白，那怕是深藏在山沟里几间草房，也都刷得洁白漂亮。在登封县的十个村镇，我们曾经走访了八个。我们在这些村镇上看到的，街道都经过平整，两旁台阶砌得整齐美观，家家门口都设有太平水缸、垃圾箱，大门、窗户都经过粉刷油漆，焕然一新。
    就以厕所来说吧，过去是蚊蝇聚生的地方，现在每个厕所上都加有盖子，墙壁粉刷一新。有些村子还请会画画的人，在厕所的墙壁上画着几枝牡丹花卉。因此有很多人说：“这简直不像厕所，倒像是戏台上的布景一样美观了。”
    年前，全县改装了六万多个厕所，五万多个厨房炉灶，基本上把全县每户的厕所和炉灶都改装了一遍。
    在大冶村，我们看了几家农民。在厨房里，炉灶都是泥得白光，一尘不染；案板刷得上下发白，碗有碗橱、筷有筷袋，就连那些土制的瓦盆子、面罐子也都洗得黑明发亮，没有半点灰星儿。走进屋子里，衣服、被褥都洗得干净洁白。在这里不但早已推行新接生法，妇女们还有“月经牌”、“孕妇照顾”的经常制度，在妇女月经期或怀孕不能做重体力劳动时期，都有个牌牌。生产队长就是根据这些牌子分配给她们适当的劳动。
    越是在脏的地方，卫生工作越是作得彻底。在这里的牲口圈中，看得更是显著。牲口槽洗得很干净，每个槽上、水缸和料缸上都有盖子，圈里总是垫着细软的黄土。牲口讲了卫生，肥力增加了，疾病减少了。在大冶村，1955年三个月就开支了牲口医药费八百七十九元；在他们开展“三勤五净”的牲口讲卫生运动后，1957年全年只开支了二十一元。
    登封县在2月底已经消灭了五十四万只老鼠，七十一万只麻雀，平均每户消灭了十只老鼠，十多只麻雀。
