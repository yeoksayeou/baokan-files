Everyone Come "Collecting Folk Songs"
    Zhejiang Normal College, Li Guangde

    Our country's first collection of poems, the "Book of Songs," mostly comes from folk songs. The "Airs of the States" directly and concentratedly reflects the lives of the working people at that time. How did these good poems come about? The Book of Han: Treatise on Food and Money says: "Envoys shook wooden clappers on the road to collect poems." These folk songs circulating among the people were collected by countless "envoys." Today, poetry is being produced in our lives every moment. We have a responsibility to record these poems circulating in the mouths of the people.

    To timely reflect the vigor of the Chinese people's Great Leap Forward and the various miracles appearing in the Great Leap Forward, it is not enough to rely solely on writers writing articles. Workers and peasants are constantly creating. Our comrades going to the countryside, writers and poets going to the countryside, in addition to their own creations, must also undertake the task of "collecting folk songs." I suggest organizing a "collecting folk songs" competition to see who "collects folk songs" the most and the best. At the same time, I also suggest that comrades engaged in propaganda work in various places also start to "collect poetry" anytime and anywhere.

    Let everyone of us come to "collect folk songs"!

    大家来“采风”
    浙江师范学院　李广德
    我国的第一部诗歌总集“诗经”，多是来自民间的歌谣，其中的“国风”更是直接地集中地反映了当时劳动人民的生活。这些好诗怎样来的呢？汉书：食货志说：“行人振木铎徇于路以采诗”，这些流传在民间的歌谣，是经过无数的“行人”采集了起来的。今天，在我们的生活里，每时每刻都在产生着诗，这些流传在人民口头上的诗歌，我们有责任把它记载下来。
    要及时地反映我国人民大跃进的劲头，反映大跃进中出现的各种奇迹，光靠作家写文章是太不够了。工农群众时时刻刻进行着创作，我们下乡的同志，下乡的作家和诗人，除了自己创作以外，还要担负起“采风”的任务。我建议组织一个“采风”的竞赛，看谁“采风”采得多，采得好。同时我也建议各地从事宣传工作的同志，也来动手随时随地的“采诗”。
    让我们每个人都来“采风”吧！
