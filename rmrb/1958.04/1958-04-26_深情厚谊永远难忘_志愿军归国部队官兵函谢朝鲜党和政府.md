Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 25th: The entire contingent of the first group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops returning home, upon their departure from Korea, wrote a letter to the Korean Party and Government to bid farewell and express their gratitude. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, our dear Korean fathers, brothers, sisters, and our closest comrades-in-arms, all comrades of the Korean People's Army:

We, the entire contingent of the first group of Volunteer Army troops returning home, on the eve of our departure from Korea, with feelings of immense attachment and reluctance to part, extend our farewells to the Korean Workers' Party, the Supreme People's Assembly, and Premier Kim Il-sung, who have shown us such affectionate care for more than seven years, and to the Korean people, who are as close to us as our own flesh and blood, and to our dear comrades-in-arms, the Korean People's Army.

We are about to leave heroic Korea, but the deep friendship of the Korean people is engraved in our hearts. We will never forget that during the years when we fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army against the American aggressors, the entire Korean people, despite suffering great sacrifices and extreme difficulties, braved air raids, endured hunger and cold, and helped us transport grain and ammunition, rescue the wounded, and repair roads, day and night, in severe winter and sweltering summer. We will never forget that when we joined hands with the Korean People's Army to maintain the armistice agreement and defend the line of peace, when the Korean people were rebuilding their homes from ruins, they gave us the greatest support and assistance in all our activities such as rest, training, construction, and production. We will never forget the encouragement and honor that the Korean government and people have bestowed upon us for more than seven years. As we return home, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued seven decisions regarding commemorating and sending us off. Premier Kim Il-sung and leaders of the Labor Party and the government personally came to give us parting instructions and encouragement. When the steadfast Korean people warmly bid us farewell, they shed precious tears and presented us with family heirlooms passed down through generations as souvenirs. All these deep sentiments of friendship have given us boundless courage and strength in the past, and will continue to inspire us forever in the future. At this moment of parting, please accept our heartfelt and sincere gratitude.

In the great struggle against America, we fought together, lived together, shared difficulties, and cheered for victory together. For the sake of our common cause, our blood flowed together, bringing the long-standing traditional friendship between China and Korea to a new height. Although we are about to say goodbye today, our hearts are forever together. The common cause of building socialism and opposing American aggression closely connects us. At this time of parting, we solemnly pledge: If anyone dares to invade Korea again, as long as the Korean government and people deem it necessary, we will cross the Yalu River again and fight alongside the Korean people to resist aggression and defend peace.

For more than seven years, we have witnessed with our own eyes that when their motherland faced enormous disasters and suffering, the Korean people and the People's Army were heroic and indomitable, defending the independence and freedom of their motherland with their lives and blood. After the armistice, filled with firm conviction, they rapidly rebuilt their motherland and homes with their own hands and wisdom on a land of ruins and scorched earth, creating a happy life. The Korean People's Army, tempered by the harsh trials of war and the training of the post-war years, has become an even stronger and more modernized revolutionary army.

The high patriotism and internationalism, heroic and indomitable spirit, diligence and simplicity of the Korean people and the People's Army, as well as their hard work and revolutionary optimism full of creativity, are forever worthy of our learning. We need not only bring the deep friendship of the Korean people towards the Chinese people back to our motherland, but also bring back the noble qualities and valuable style of the Korean people to our motherland. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic Government, and Premier Kim Il-sung, the heroic Korean people, having overcome the aggression of American imperialism and rapidly restored and greatly developed the national economy in just four years, will, now that the strength of the Korean people is even greater and the overall international situation is one where the East wind prevails over the West wind, surely be able to achieve the reunification of the three thousand li of beautiful Korean territory through the resolute struggle of the entire Korean people. The cause of socialist construction in Korea will surely achieve final victory.

Long live the militant friendship forged in blood between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
Long live the heroic Korean people!
Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace!

The entire contingent of the first group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops returning home

    深情厚谊永远难忘
    志愿军归国部队官兵函谢朝鲜党和政府
    新华社平壤25日电　中国人民志愿军首批归国部队全体官兵在撤离朝鲜的时候，写信给朝鲜党和政府告别并表示感谢。信的全文如下：朝鲜劳动党中央委员会朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁亲爱的朝鲜父老兄弟诸姑姊妹和我们
  最亲密的战友朝鲜人民军全体同志们：
    我们，志愿军首批归国部队的全体官兵，在撤离朝鲜的前夕，怀着万分依恋和惜别的心情，谨向七年多来亲切关怀着我们的朝鲜劳动党、最高人民会议、金日成首相告别，向情同骨肉的朝鲜人民和亲密的战友朝鲜人民军告别。
    我们即将离开英雄的朝鲜，但我们心中铭刻着朝鲜人民的深情厚谊。我们永远难以忘记：在我们同朝鲜人民军并肩反抗美国侵略者的岁月里，全朝鲜人民在遭受重大牺牲和极端困难的情况下，冒空袭、忍饥寒，不分白昼黑夜，不分严冬盛夏，帮助我们运送粮弹，救护伤员，抢修道路。在我们同朝鲜人民军携手维护停战协定、保卫和平防线的时候，朝鲜人民从一片废墟上重建家园的时候，对我们休整、训练、营建、生产等一切活动，给了最大的支援和帮助。我们永远难以忘记朝鲜政府和人民七年多来给予我们的勉励和荣誉。在我们回国的时候，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁，发布关于纪念和欢送我们的七项决定。金日成首相及劳动党和政府的领导人亲来对我们作临别的教导和勉励。坚强的朝鲜人民当热情送别我们的时候，流下珍贵的眼泪，并将祖祖辈辈的传家宝送我们作纪念。这一切深情厚谊，过去曾给我们以无限勇气和力量，今后仍将永远给我们以鼓舞。在这分别的时刻，请接受我们衷心诚挚的感谢。
    在伟大的抗美斗争中，我们共同战斗，一起生活，互相分担困难，齐声欢呼胜利。为了共同的事业，我们的鲜血曾流在一起，使本来就有着悠久传统的中朝友谊，发展到了一个新的高度。今天我们虽然就要告别，但我们的心是永远在一起的。建设社会主义和反对美国侵略的共同事业，紧紧地联系着我们。在这分别的时候，我们庄严地保证：如果有谁胆敢再次侵略朝鲜，只要朝鲜政府和人民认为需要，我们将再次跨过鸭绿江来，与朝鲜人民并肩抗击侵略、保卫和平。
    七年多来我们亲眼看到：朝鲜人民和人民军在祖国面临巨大灾难和痛苦的时候，英勇顽强，坚贞不屈，用生命和鲜血保卫了自己祖国的独立和自由；停战之后又满怀着坚定的信念，在一片废墟和焦土上用自己的双手和智慧，迅速重建自己的祖国和家园，创造幸福生活。朝鲜人民军经过战争严酷的锻炼和战后的几年训练，已经成为更加强大的现代化的革命军队。
    朝鲜人民和人民军这种高度爱国主义和国际主义，英勇顽强，勤劳朴素的高贵品质和艰苦奋斗、富于创造的革命乐观主义精神，永远值得我们学习。我们不仅需要把朝鲜人民对中国人民的深厚友谊带回祖国去，而且也要把朝鲜人民这种崇高的品质和可贵的作风带回祖国去。我们坚信：英雄的朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党中央、共和国政府和金日成首相的英明领导下，既然能够战胜美帝国主义的侵略，能够在短短的四年中使国民经济得到迅速的恢复和巨大的发展，那么，当朝鲜人民的力量已经更为强大、整个国际局势已是东风压倒西风的今天，经过全朝鲜人民的坚决斗争，朝鲜三千里锦绣江山一定能够统一，南北朝鲜人民终将团聚，朝鲜的社会主义建设事业必将取得最后的胜利。
    中朝两国人民以鲜血结成的战斗友谊万岁！
    英雄的朝鲜人民万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
        中国人民志愿军首批归国部队全体官兵
