    Successful Fertilizer Experiments with Liquid Ammonia and Ammonia Water
    Rice and corn experiments using ammonia water as a base fertilizer and top dressing show that the yield-increasing effect of ammonia water is comparable to, or even better than, ammonium sulfate. Winter wheat with liquid ammonia as a base fertilizer has shown more even emergence and good growth.
    This is an important research project conducted by fertilizer scientists to realize the National Agricultural Development Program and find the cheapest and most effective nitrogen fertilizer varieties – the results of experiments on the fertilization methods of liquid ammonia and ammonia water. This work was organized in 1957 by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in cooperation with the Ministry of Chemical Industry, with the Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute and agricultural science research institutes in Northeast and East China conducting experiments in Beijing, Jilin, Nanjing, and other locations.
    Liquid ammonia is made by combining nitrogen and hydrogen separated from the air into gaseous ammonia, which is then converted by applying pressure. It is usually used as the main raw material for manufacturing solid nitrogen fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, and urea. At the same time, it is the most concentrated nitrogen fertilizer, with a nitrogen content of up to 82.3%, making it the most effective nitrogen fertilizer. Ammonia water is an aqueous solution of ammonia, containing only about 20% nitrogen, but its storage, transportation, and application are simpler than liquid ammonia.

    用液体氨和氨水作肥料试验成功
    水稻、玉米的氨水基肥和追肥试验证明，氨水的增产效果同硫酸铵比较不相上下，甚至还要好一些；采用液体氨作基肥的冬小麦，出苗比较整齐，生长良好。
    这是肥料科学工作者为实现全国农业发展纲要、寻找最便宜和有效的氮肥品种而进行的一个重要的研究项目——液体氨和氨水的施肥方法试验得到的成果。这项工作是中国农业科学院同化学工业部合作，在1957年组织土壤肥料研究所和东北、华东的农业科学研究所分别在北京、吉林、南京等地进行的。
    液体氨是由空气中分离出的氮、氢化合而成气态氨，再施加压力转变而成的。通常它是用来制造硫酸铵、硝酸铵、氯化氨、尿素等固体氮肥的主要原料。同时它是一种最浓缩的氮肥，含氮量高达82.3％，是氮肥中肥效最大的。氨水是氨的水溶液，含氮只20％左右，但是它的贮存、运输、施用都比液体氨简单。
