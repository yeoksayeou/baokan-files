    New Influenza Vaccine
    Fukumi, director of the Bacteriology Department of the Japanese National Institute of Health, recently introduced a new influenza vaccine at a joint conference held by the institute and the Institute of Infectious Diseases of the University of Tokyo.
    Fukumi has used this new vaccine for experimental inoculation of two groups of young people, and the results show that the new vaccine has a significant effect in preventing influenza; this vaccine can also determine whether the test subjects have been infected with influenza.
    The new vaccine is made from a single virus. Its characteristics are simple and easy to manufacture, low cost, good curative effect, and not prone to side effects. At present, in Japan, the new vaccine has replaced the mixed vaccine used to resist the second influenza that occurred in the autumn of 1957.

    新的流行性感冒疫苗
    日本国家卫生研究所细菌学系主任福见最近在一次由该所和东京大学传染病研究所联合召开的会议上，介绍了一种新的流行性感冒疫苗。
    福见曾经用这种新的疫苗对两组青年进行实验性接种，结果发现新疫苗在防御流行性感冒上有显著功效；这种疫苗还能确定受试验者是否传染到流行性感冒。
    新疫苗是用单一病毒制成的。它的特点是简单易制，成本低廉，疗效好，而且不容易发生副作用。目前，在日本新疫苗已经代替了为抵御1957年秋季发生的第二次流行性感冒所采用的混合疫苗。
