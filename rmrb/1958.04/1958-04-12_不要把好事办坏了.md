    Don't Turn a Good Thing into a Bad Thing
    I recently inspected the literacy campaign in Bashihan Township, Jianchang County, Liaoning Province, and found that many private schools in this township had established public pledges to fine work points and fine sorghum stalks. The private school of the Seventh Production Team of Hongda Cooperative stipulates that one night of absence from study without reason will result in a fine of three work points; the private school of the Twelfth Production Team stipulates that one missed class will result in a fine of two work points. Seven private schools in Lianxiang Cooperative have stipulated fines of sorghum stalks. The two production teams of Hongda Cooperative have fined seventeen cooperative members in a row. In just five or six days, Qianjin Cooperative fined cooperative members more than thirty bundles of sorghum stalks, causing dissatisfaction among some farmers, while some production team leaders said, "This medicine works well."
    I believe that the township and cooperative leadership of Bashihan Township should immediately change this practice. Enabling farmers to become literate is originally a good thing, but if a disguised form of coercion is used to make farmers enroll in school, it will be opposed by the farmers, thus turning a good thing into a bad thing.

    不要把好事办坏了
    我最近到辽宁省建昌县巴什罕乡检查扫盲工作，发现这个乡有好多民校都订了罚工分、罚秫秸的公约。宏大社第七生产队的民校规定，一晚上无故不参加学习，罚三分工；第十二生产队的民校规定，旷一次课，罚二分工。联乡社有七个民校都规定罚秫秸。宏大社这两个生产队一连罚了十七个社员。前进社仅五、六天就罚社员三十多捆秫秸，引起一些农民不满，而有的生产队长还说：“这付药好使。”
    我觉得巴什罕乡的乡、社领导上应该立即改变这种做法。使农民识字本来是一件好事情，但是如果采用变相强迫的方法使农民入学，就会遭到农民的反对，这样就把好事情给办坏了。
