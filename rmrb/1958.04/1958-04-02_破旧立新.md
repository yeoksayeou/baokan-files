Changing Postal and Telecommunications Regulations Benefits the Masses in Xushui

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, April 1st – In the rectification movement, the Xushui County Post and Telecommunications Bureau of Hebei Province changed four outdated regulations based on mass opinions, which has been very convenient for the people.

The new methods in Xushui County are: First, all townships and cooperatives with telephones can make long-distance calls or send telegrams locally after contacting the county Post and Telecommunications Bureau. After the masses make calls or send telegrams, they hand over the money to the township or cooperative for collection, and the Post and Telecommunications Bureau sends people to collect from each township, without increasing the burden on the townships and cooperatives. This saves the masses from having to travel a long distance to the county Post and Telecommunications Bureau as before. Since the Xushui County Post and Telecommunications Bureau implemented this method in January, it has been very popular with the masses, and the business has also expanded, with basically no errors. Second, for urban telephone users who want to install, move, or remove telephones, the Post and Telecommunications Bureau will handle it upon receiving notification and have the user write an application at the same time. The telephone will be installed or moved, and the application will be brought back at the same time, without further delay. Third, for remittances to Xushui County, as long as the recipient's credentials are reliable, if the recipient has difficulty withdrawing the money at the designated bureau, other bureaus can also accommodate the withdrawal to facilitate the masses in collecting the money nearby. Fourth, a reliable guarantor is used instead of the previous method of requiring the person to stamp the remittance in person before withdrawal, which saves the farmer from having to get a seal at the last minute.

Working Even During “Fasting”

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi – The Uygur and Hui farmers living in the Turpan Basin have broken the habit of not working or working very little during the “fasting” period in previous years. They are now busy sowing cotton and striving to complete the sowing of more than 160,000 mu within half a month to twenty days.

Now is the cotton sowing season in the Turpan Basin of Xinjiang, and it is also the "fasting" period in the religious life of the Uygur and Hui people who believe in Islam. The attendance rate of Uygur and Hui members of various agricultural cooperatives is above 90% in the Great Leap Forward. Uygur women, who rarely worked in the fields in the past, have also participated in activities such as carrying soil and manure and leveling the land. The winter irrigation area of ​​many agricultural cooperative cotton fields has reached 100%.

Camels Can Plow the Land

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, April 1st – The Jinma Agricultural Cooperative in Jinta County, Gansu Province, broke thousands of years of convention during spring plowing and used camels to plow the land for the first time.

When the Jinma Agricultural Cooperative began experimenting, it used two camels to pull a double-wheeled double-shared plow. At first, the camels were a little panicked when they heard the rattling sound of the plowshare and jumped around, but after a while, they gradually calmed down. In about five hours, they plowed more than five mu of wasteland. After that, the entire cooperative distributed more than 40 grazing camels to various production teams to plow the fields. Using one camel to pull a walking plow is twice as efficient as using an ox.

After the success of camel plowing, the Jinma Cooperative solved the difficulty of insufficient animal power in spring plowing. Now, Minqin County has also put more than 2,000 idle camels into spring plowing work.

    破旧立新
    改变邮电陈规徐水群众称便
    据新华社保定1日电河北徐水县邮电局在整风运动中根据群众意见，改变了四项陈规，群众称便。
    徐水县的新办法是：第一项，凡设有电话的乡和社经过同县邮电局接洽后，都可以就地打长途电话或发电报。群众打完电话或电报后，把钱交给乡、社代收，由邮电局派人到各乡去收取，不增加乡社负担。这样，群众就不用像从前那样再跑很远的路到县邮电局去办理了。徐水县邮电局从1月份实行这个办法以后，很受群众欢迎，业务也扩大了。而且基本上没出差错。第二项，市内电话用户要装、移、拆电话，邮电局接到通知后一面办理，一面让用户写申请，电话机装移好，同时将申请书带回来，不会再耽误时间。第三项是汇到徐水县境内的汇款，只要收款人证件确实可靠，如收款人到指定局支取有困难，也可以由其他局通融代兑，以便利群众就近取款。第四项，用可靠的铺保代替过去一定要本人盖章才能取汇款的办法，这就省得取款农民临时刻图章。“封斋”期间也出工
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电生活在吐鲁番盆地的维吾尔族和回族农民，打破了往年“封斋”期间不出工或很少出工的习惯，正在紧张地播种棉花，争取半个月到二十天内播完十六万多亩。
    现在，正是新疆吐鲁番盆地的棉花播种季节，也是维吾尔族和回族信仰伊斯兰教人民在宗教生活上的“封斋”期。各农业社的维吾尔族和回族社员，在大跃进中出勤率都在90％以上。过去很少到田间劳动的维吾尔族妇女，也都参加了抬土送粪、平整土地等活动。很多农业社棉田的冬灌面积达到百分之百。
    骆驼能耕地
    据新华社兰州1日电甘肃金塔县金马农业社，在春耕中打破了几千年的常规，第一次使用骆驼耕地。
    金马农业社开始试验时，用两峰骆驼套一部双轮双铧犁犁地。起初，骆驼听见犁铧哗拉哗拉的响，有些惊慌，跳跳蹦蹦，但是过了一会儿，就渐渐安定下来。大约五个小时，就犁完了五亩多荒地。这以后，全社就把放牧的四十多峰骆驼分给各生产队，下地耕田了。用一峰骆驼拉一部步犁，工作效率比牛快一倍。
    骆驼犁地成功以后，金马社春耕中畜力不足的困难就解决了。现在，民勤县也把闲置无用的二千多峰骆驼投入了春耕工作。　刘勃舒插图（附图片）
