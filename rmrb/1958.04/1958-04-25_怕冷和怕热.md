Why

    Fear of Cold and Fear of Heat

    Underneath the human skin is a layer of oily substance called subcutaneous fat. It is like a natural cotton coat that maintains body temperature. Fat is a poor conductor of heat (if there is oil on soup, it is particularly hot, which is the reason), and without it, human life would be unimaginable—people would become "cold-blooded animals" and unable to survive.

    Fat people have a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, and the heat inside their bodies is not easily dissipated. Therefore, they are not afraid of the cold in winter but are afraid of the heat in summer. Thin people have thin subcutaneous fat, so conversely, they are afraid of the cold in winter and not afraid of the heat in summer. Generally speaking, fat people are afraid of heat but not afraid of cold, and thin people are afraid of cold but not afraid of heat.

    However, this is not absolute, because the feeling of cold and heat is a matter of the nervous system. Trained people have a stronger adaptation to cold and heat in their nervous systems. For example, a thin person who grows up in the north may be less afraid of the cold than a fat person who lives in the south for a long time; a fat person working in a high-temperature workshop may be more heat-resistant than a general thin person.

专栏：为什么

    怕冷和怕热
    人体皮肤下面有一层油质的东西，叫皮下脂肪。它仿佛是一件天然的棉衣，能保持体温。脂肪是热的不良导体（汤上面如果有油，特别烫嘴，就是这个道理），人体要是没有它，生命就不堪设想——人将成为“冷血动物”，活不下去。
    胖人这层皮下脂肪很厚，身体里的热不容易发散出来，因而在冬天不怕冷，在夏天则怕热。瘦人呢皮下脂肪薄，因而相反地冬天怕冷，夏天不怕热。一般说来，胖人怕热不怕冷、瘦人怕冷不怕热。
    可是这也不是绝对的，因为冷热的感受，是神经系统的事。受过训练的人，神经系统对冷热的适应较强。例如在北方生长的瘦子，会比长住在南方的胖子还不怕冷些；在高热车间工作的胖子，会比一般瘦子耐热。　　　　（景）
