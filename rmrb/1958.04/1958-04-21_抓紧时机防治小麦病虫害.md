Seize the Time to Prevent and Control Wheat Pests and Diseases

Strengthening the prevention and control of wheat pests and diseases in wheat-growing areas is an important link in ensuring strong wheat seedling growth and higher grain yields. Neglecting this important link will inevitably severely affect the wheat harvest. Wheat affected by wheat aphids and wheat spider mites will experience yellowing of stems and leaves in mild cases, and death of the entire plant in severe cases. If wheat is affected by wheat midges, the grains will become shriveled. If wheat rust becomes epidemic, the losses will be even greater.

This year, the area under irrigation has been expanded, the amount of fertilizer applied has been increased, and the temperature has been relatively high from last winter to this spring. These are all factors that favor the occurrence of various pests and diseases such as wheat midges, wheat spider mites, and wheat rust. According to recent reports from various regions, the occurrence of wheat pests and diseases is half a month to a month earlier than in previous years, covering a wide area with high density. These situations should be given serious attention by agricultural cooperatives in wheat-growing areas. Ascertain the occurrence of pests and diseases, carry out ideological mobilization before prevention and control, and make preparations for technology, pesticides, machinery, and labor to create favorable conditions for rapidly eliminating pests and diseases.

Experience has shown that as long as the occurrence of pests and diseases is accurately grasped, preparations are sufficient, and the elimination action is timely, the effect of prevention and control is great. For example, in 1952, wheat aphids occurred in unprecedented severity in Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces. Through vigorous capture and elimination, more than 1.9 million mu of wheat aphids were eliminated, reducing the harm caused by insects. According to the experience of Shaanxi Province in using 666 powder to control wheat spider mites, the insecticidal effect of pesticides is generally above 90%. Spraying 666 powder has a great effect on preventing yield reduction caused by insect pests. According to a survey in the control area of Henan Province, the average yield increase was more than 30 jin per mu. Early and rapid spraying of lime-sulfur mixture can also control the spread of wheat stem rust.

Currently, it is the wheat growing season and also a crucial period for whether this year's wheat can achieve a bumper harvest. Agricultural cooperatives in wheat-producing areas, while strengthening wheat field management, should allocate sufficient resources to prevent and control pests and diseases.

    抓紧时机防治小麦病虫害
    加强麦区的病虫害防治工作是保证麦苗生长健壮，多打粮食的重要环节之一，忽视了这一重要环节，小麦丰收必然遭到严重的影响。被麦蚜、麦蜘蛛为害的小麦，轻者茎叶变黄，重者全株枯死；小麦被吸浆虫为害以后麦粒就干秕了；小麦锈病如果流行起来，所造成的损失就更大了。
    今年水浇面积扩大了，施肥量增多了，去冬今春温度较高，这些都是有利于小麦吸浆虫、麦蜘蛛、小麦锈病等多种病虫发生的因素。最近据各地报告：麦类病虫害比往年提早发生半月至一个月，面积广、密度大。这些情况应引起麦区各农业社的严重注意。摸清病虫发生情况，进行防治前的思想发动，做好技术、药械、劳动力等准备工作，为迅速扑灭病虫害创造良好条件。
    经验证明：只要确切掌握病虫发生情况，准备工作充足，扑灭行动及时，防治的效果是很大的。如1952年河南、山西、陕西等省麦蚜空前严重发生，经大力捕打，消灭麦蚜一百九十余万亩，减轻了虫子为害。据陕西省用六六六粉防治麦蜘蛛经验，药剂杀虫效果一般在90％以上。喷撒六六六粉对防止虫害减产效果很大，据河南省在防治区的调查，平均每亩增产三十斤以上。及早、迅速地喷洒石灰硫磺合剂对小麦秆锈病也能控制蔓延。
    目前正当小麦生长阶段，也是今年小麦能否获得丰收的关键时期，麦产区的农业社在加强麦田管理的同时，应该拿出足够的力量来防治病虫害。
