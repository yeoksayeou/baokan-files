Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 19th April: Jiangxi Province has achieved its first great victory in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production – an unprecedented bumper harvest of rapeseed. The four million mu of rapeseed across the province have now been mostly harvested, with an average yield of sixty jin of rapeseed per mu, a doubling of last year's yield. Total production is expected to reach 240 million jin, an increase of 1.4 times over last year.

The close and timely attention of the leadership, coupled with the soaring revolutionary drive of the farmers to realize the Great Leap Forward, are the main reasons for Jiangxi Province's bumper rapeseed harvest this year. Before and after the rapeseed sowing, the provincial Party and government leading organs issued several instructions to various localities, urging them to advance the sowing, expand the sown area, and strengthen cultivation management. They also conducted multiple inspections. The farmers throughout the province were full of vigor and sowed the rapeseed one solar term earlier than in previous years, and expanded the sown area by 500,000 mu. After sowing, they weeded and applied topdressing fertilizer one to two times more than in previous years. In order to promote early maturity and full seed formation, one or two dan of urine fertilizer per mu was also splashed this spring. This year's climate was relatively warm, and early bolting occurred in some areas. The agricultural cooperatives promptly organized women to pick the bolts and applied fast-acting fertilizers, so that the rapeseed growth remained vigorous. Finally, they won a bumper harvest.

    江西油菜大丰收
    据新华社南昌19日电　江西省农业生产大跃进取得第一个巨大胜利——油菜生产空前丰收。全省四百万亩油菜现在大部分已经收割完毕，平均单位面积产量达六十斤菜籽，比去年增产一倍；总产量可达二亿四千万斤，比去年增产一点四倍。
    领导抓得紧、抓得及时和农民实现大跃进的高涨的革命干劲，是江西省今年油菜丰产的主要原因。省的党政领导机关在油菜播种前后，曾经几次向各地发出提早播种、扩大播种面积和加强培育管理的指示，并且多次进行检查。全省农民干劲十足，油菜播种比往年提早了一个节气，并且扩大了五十万亩播种面积。播种后，比往年多进行了一次到两次锄草和追肥。为了促进早熟、结籽饱满，今春每亩又泼了一两担尿肥。今年气候比较暖和，有些地区的油菜曾发生早苔现象，农业社便及时组织妇女摘苔，并追施了速效性的肥料，使油菜生长仍然旺盛。终于赢得了丰收。
