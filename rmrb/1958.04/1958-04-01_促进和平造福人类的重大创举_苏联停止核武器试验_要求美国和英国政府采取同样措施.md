Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch. TASS reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko made a statement today at the joint session of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. He said that among the countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons, only the Soviet Union is ready to sign an agreement without delay to terminate the experimental explosions of atomic and hydrogen bombs.

He said, we realize that stopping testing does not mean completely eliminating the danger of atomic war. Therefore, while advocating the cessation of experimental explosions, we explicitly declare that we consider our primary goal to be: reaching an agreement with other countries on the unconditional prohibition of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the cessation of their production, the complete destruction of existing stockpiles of such weapons, and the establishment of corresponding supervision. However, the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have not shown sincerity in this regard, although taking such steps by the three major powers possessing nuclear weapons would undoubtedly be welcomed by all mankind.

Gromyko said that it cannot be ignored that some people in the West, especially some in the United States, believe that stopping nuclear weapons testing poses a danger to the economies of Western countries. Gromyko said that the danger threatening the economies of Western countries does not come from stopping nuclear weapons testing, nor from stopping the arms race, but from the militarization that is already restricting the entire economy of the Atlantic Group participants. There is every reason to believe that the higher the degree of militarization of these countries' economies, the deeper they will sink into the abyss of economic collapse. Gromyko said, you must know that atomic and hydrogen bombs have not been able to save 5.3 million Americans from unemployment today.

Gromyko emphasized that considering that currently only the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom possess and produce such weapons, an agreement on stopping the testing of nuclear weapons is relatively easy to achieve. He said that therefore, as long as these three countries reach an agreement, the problem can be solved. Gromyko continued, often one hears the argument that Britain demands to continue testing atomic and hydrogen weapons because it lags behind in this area and wants to catch up with the Soviet Union and the United States. He pointed out that this is a strange argument. In fact, if nuclear testing continues, how can the British be sure that they will eliminate the lag, rather than fall further behind? A race is a race, and all parties will obviously work hard and be unwilling to fall behind.

Gromyko said that it is strange that France is also against an agreement on stopping nuclear weapons testing; no one knows why this is the case, but it is the truth. Although it is hard to believe, it seems that among those who determine French policy today, there are indeed people who genuinely believe that the national interests of this country require France to participate in the nuclear weapons race and begin to consume its economic resources in this regard.

Gromyko said that stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons can and should become the first step toward mutual trust and a manifestation of mutual trust between major powers, which the people of all countries so desire.

Gromyko continued that currently, the necessary international conditions are in place to resolve the issue of stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. He said, it is obvious that there will soon come a day when the governments of Western countries can no longer turn a deaf ear to the universal call to stop nuclear testing.

Gromyko said that in order to do everything possible to achieve the great goal of freeing mankind from the threat of atomic war, the Soviet Council of Ministers has submitted a proposal to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for review: as the first step on this path, the Soviet Union will unilaterally cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

If the United States and Britain also adopt the Soviet Union's approach and decide to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, then such a problem that all the people of all countries are deeply concerned about will eventually be solved: the experimental explosions of nuclear weapons will be universally ended forever.

Gromyko said, needless to say, if the governments of other countries possessing nuclear weapons are unwilling to respond to the Soviet Union's initiative and continue to conduct atomic and hydrogen weapon explosions, then the Soviet Union will still have to take actions that take into account its own security interests in the future on the issue of nuclear weapon testing.

Gromyko said that the Soviet Union has more than once unilaterally taken measures to reduce its armed forces and armaments. He said that if those who are planning war preparations expect that only the Soviet Union will continue to implement unilateral disarmament, while Western countries expand their armaments, then they are miscalculating. Disarmament can only be based on a sincere agreement that takes into account the security interests of all countries.

Gromyko said that the Soviet government is submitting the proposal for the Soviet Union to unilaterally cease atomic and hydrogen weapon testing to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for discussion, while expecting that the United States and Britain will also take the same decision as the Soviet Union, thereby contributing to the cause of limiting the nuclear arms race and reducing the danger of atomic war.

The Soviet government is convinced that the universal cessation of nuclear testing will initiate a transformation in international relations, developing in the direction of enhancing trust and peaceful cooperation between countries.

Gromyko said that the reason why taking active measures in normalizing international relations is urgently needed is because there is a force on the international stage that is stubbornly pushing the world in the completely opposite direction. A convincing example of the activities of this force is the decision recently passed by the ruling party of the Federal Republic of Germany in the Federal Parliament: authorizing the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to equip the armed forces of West Germany with atomic weapons and rocket weapons. The Federal Parliament's decision on March 25th opened the door wide for the atomic armament of West German militarists.

Gromyko said that those who are now stepping up the atomic armament of the West German army should bear a more serious responsibility to the people of all countries, because this is happening during the period when the major powers are discussing convening a high-level meeting, and if the atomic armament of the Federal Republic of Germany becomes a reality, then this will inevitably create new obstacles to reaching an agreement on disarmament between countries, and the responsibility for this must be borne by the West German government and the governments of the countries that are encouraging it to take such steps.

Gromyko submitted a draft resolution to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, stipulating the cessation of testing of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons in the Soviet Union. The draft says that the Supreme Soviet instructs the Soviet Council of Ministers to take the necessary measures to implement this resolution, and appeals to the governments of other countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons to take the same measures in order to "guarantee the universal cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons forever."

The draft resolution points out that if other countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons continue to test such weapons, then the Soviet government, considering the interests of Soviet security, will naturally be free to act on the issue of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    促进和平造福人类的重大创举
    苏联停止核武器试验
    要求美国和英国政府采取同样措施
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯今天在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上发表了关于停止原子武器和氢武器试验的声明。他说，在拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家中，还只有苏联是唯一的一个国家准备毫不拖延地签订一项协定来终止原子弹和氢弹的试验性爆炸。
    他说，我们意识到，停止试验还不意味着完全消除原子战争的危险。因此，我们一方面主张停止试验性爆炸，同时明确声明，我们认为自己的主要目的是：同其他国家就无条件禁止一切类型的原子武器和氢武器、停止它们的生产、完全销毁这种武器的现有储备并建立相应的监督达成协议。但是，美国和英国两国政府仍然没有对此表示诚意，虽然拥有核武器的三个大国采取这种步骤无疑地会受到全人类的感激欢迎。
    葛罗米柯说，不能不看到，西方的某些人士、特别是美国的某些人士，认为停止核武器试验对西方国家的经济是一种危险。葛罗米柯说，威胁西方国家经济的危险不是来自停止核武器试验，也不是来自停止军备竞赛，而是来自目前已经箝制大西洋集团参加国的整个经济的军事化。有一切理由认为，这些国家经济军事化的程度愈高，那末它们也就愈深地陷入经济崩溃的深渊。葛罗米柯说，要知道，原子弹和氢弹并没有能使五百三十万美国人今天免于失业。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，考虑到目前只有苏联、美国、英国这三个国家拥有和生产这种武器，因而关于停止试验核武器的协定是比较容易达成的。他说，因此，只要这三个国家达成协议，问题就可以解决。葛罗米柯接着说，往往可以听到一种论调，说什么英国要求继续试验原子武器和氢武器，因为它在这方面落后，并且想赶上苏联和美国。他指出，这是一个怪道理。其实，如果继续核试验，英国人又哪里能保险一定会消除落后状态，而不是更为落后呢？竞赛就是竞赛，各方显然都会卖力气，不甘落后。
    葛罗米柯说，奇怪的是，法国竟然也反对关于停止试验核武器的协定，谁也不知道为什么会这样，然而这是事实。虽然难以置信，然而看来在今天决定法国政策的人当中似乎的确有这样的人，他们真的认为这个国家的民族利益要求法国参加核武器竞赛和开始把自己的经济资源消耗在这方面。
    葛罗米柯说，停止试验原子武器和氢武器可以、而且应当成为各国人民所如此渴望的大国互相信任的第一步，大国互相信任的表示。
    葛罗米柯继续说，目前，已经具备必要的国际条件来解决停止试验原子武器和氢武器的问题。他说，很明显，不久总有那么一天，西方国家的政府再也不能够对要求停止核试验的普遍呼声充耳不闻了。
    葛罗米柯说，为了尽力达到使人类摆脱原子战争威胁这一伟大目标，苏联部长会议提交苏联最高苏维埃审查一项建议：作为这个道路上的第一步，苏联单方面停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器。
    如果美国和英国也采取苏联的这种做法，决定停止试验原子武器和氢武器，那末，当前各国人民所深切关怀的这样一个问题终将求得解决：将永远普遍结束核武器的试验性爆炸。
    葛罗米柯说，不用说，如果拥有核武器的其他国家政府不愿意响应苏联的倡议，而仍然进行原子武器和氢武器爆炸，那末，苏联在核武器试验问题上今后仍将不得不采取考虑到本国安全利益的行动。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联已经不止一次地单方面采取裁减自己武装部队和军备的措施。他说，如果那些策划战争准备的人指望：今后还只有苏联在实行单方面的裁军，而西方国家却在扩充自己的军备，那就打错了算盘。裁军只能以考虑到各国安全利益的真诚协议为基础。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联政府将苏联单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验的建议提交苏联最高苏维埃讨论，同时期待，美国和英国也跟苏联采取同样的决定，从而对限制核武器竞赛和减轻原子战争危险的事业作出贡献。
    苏联政府确信，普遍停止核试验将会使国际关系开始转变，朝向增强国与国之间的信任和和平合作方向发展。
    葛罗米柯说，在国际关系正常化方面，采取积极的措施之所以迫切需要，是因为在国际舞台上有一种势力正在顽固地把世界推向完全相反的方向。关于这种势力的活动有一个令人信服的例子，这就是，德意志联邦共和国执政党最近在联邦议院所通过的一项决定：授权德意志联邦共和国政府用原子武器和火箭武器装备西德的武装力量。联邦议院3月25日的决定，为西德军国主义分子的原子武装大开方便之门。
    葛罗米柯说，那些现在加紧西德军队原子武装的人，应对各国人民负有更加严重的责任，因为这是正在大国商谈召开高级会议的期间发生的，如果德意志联邦共和国原子武装成为事实，那末，这将不可避免地给各国就裁军问题达成协议造成新的障碍，而这个责任要由西德政府和那些怂恿它采取这种步骤的国家的政府来担负。
    葛罗米柯向苏联最高苏维埃提出了一项决议草案，规定在苏联停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器。草案中说，最高苏维埃责成苏联部长会议采取必要的措施实现本决议，并向拥有原子武器和氢武器的其他国家政府呼吁采取同样的措施，以便“保证永远普遍停止试验原子武器和氢武器”。
    决议草案中指出，如果拥有原子武器和氢武器的其他国家继续试验这种武器，那末，苏联政府考虑到苏联安全的利益，自然将在试验原子武器和氢武器这一问题上自由行动。
