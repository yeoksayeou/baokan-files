    Criticism from the Masses
    Long-distance calls should not be used in this way
    In February of this year, one morning, we went to the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of Henan Province to discuss work. In the office of the Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee, we saw a section chief listening to a report on a long-distance call. He had already started speaking when we arrived, and he continued to speak while we were handling our work. The matter he was talking about did not sound very important.
    I believe that using long-distance calls in this way without paying attention to saving time is a wasteful behavior.

    This is a waste
    On the 7th of this month, the Hubei Provincial Agricultural Technology Guidance Group came to Songzi County, and the people of the county were very excited.
    However, when entertaining the guidance group, the County Committee squandered lavishly. It is said that they originally wanted to buy a spring bed for each member of the guidance group, but because they couldn't buy them, they later bought each of them a new wooden bed and brand-new bedding, spending about 1,000 yuan. The tableware and daily necessities were all newly bought, and it cost more than 30 yuan just to buy ivory chopsticks, and more than 200 yuan to treat the guidance group to a meal. I ask, in what way does this conform to the spirit of frugality?　Hubei Province, Songzi County　Hu Shouwen

    不应该如此使用长途电话
    今年2月间一天上午，我们到河南信阳地委去接洽工作，在地委宣传部的办公室里，看到一位科长正在用长途电话听取汇报。我们去时他已讲上了，在我们办理工作时间，他还一直在讲，讲的事情听起来并不很重要。
    我认为：打长途电话这样不注意节约时间，是一种浪费行为。

    这是一种挥霍
    本月7日，湖北省农业技术辅导团来到了松滋县，全县人民感到异常兴奋。
    但在招待辅导团的时候，县委会却大肆挥霍。据说原来要给辅导团人员每人买一张钢丝床，因买不到，后来给每人买了一张新木床，买了崭新的铺盖，约花去一千多元。餐具和日常用品都是新买的，光买牙骨筷子就花了三十多元，请辅导团人员吃了一顿又花了两百多元。请问，这在哪一点上合乎俭朴的精神。　湖北省松滋县　胡守文
