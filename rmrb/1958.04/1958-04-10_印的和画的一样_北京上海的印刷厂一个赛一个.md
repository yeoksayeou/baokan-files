    The printing is just like the painting
    Beijing and Shanghai printing factories are competing with each other
    (Our Newspaper) News: For more than twenty days, the competition for the world's most advanced level has been fiercely unfolding in the printing industry of Shanghai and Beijing. The dot density of offset printing has jumped to 510 lines, far exceeding the dot density of the well-known West German Aigen factory - 300 lines.
    In the past, the dot density of offset printing in our country was generally only 100 to 200 lines. On March 18th and 19th this year, the Shanghai Sanyi Printing Factory and Xinxin Printing Factory simultaneously printed the first batch of exquisite pictures with 300-line offset printing, catching up with the West German Aigen factory. Immediately afterwards, the Shanghai Tobacco Industry Printing Factory reached a higher level of 320 lines and 350 lines on the 24th; on the 25th, Shanghai No. 1 Printing Factory rushed to produce a set of offset prints with a density of 400 lines; on the 29th, the Shanghai Printing Factory of Zhonghua Book Company successfully trial-produced 426-line offset prints. After seeing the news from Shanghai No. 1 Printing Factory, the workers of Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory immediately took action and successfully printed color pictures with a 450-line screen on March 31st. On April 2nd, Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory successfully printed color pictures using a 465-line screen. On April 5th, workers in the plate-making workshop of Beijing Jinghua Offset Printing Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, successfully trial-produced 510-line offset prints. The printed "Peace Peony" picture is just like the painting. By the 7th, Xinhua Printing Factory had also produced 500-line offset prints.

    印的和画的一样
    北京上海的印刷厂一个赛一个
    本报讯　争夺世界最先进水平的竞赛，二十多天来在上海、北京的印刷工业中激烈地展开。胶版印刷网线密度已经跃进到五百一十线，远远超过了素享盛名的西德爱根厂的网线密度——三百线。
    我国过去胶版印刷网线密度一般只有一百到二百线。今年3月18、19两天，上海的三一印刷厂和新新印刷厂首先同时用三百线的胶版印出了第一批精美的画片，赶上了西德爱根厂。紧接着，上海烟草工业印刷厂在24日达到三百二十线和三百五十线的更高水平；25日上海市印刷一厂又赶制出一套密度达到四百线的胶版；29日，中华书局上海印刷厂，试制四百二十六网胶版成功。北京新华印刷厂职工，看到上海印刷一厂的消息以后，立即行动起来，在3月31日用四百五十线的网目制印彩色画片成功。4月2日，北京美术印刷厂试用四百六十五线的网目印成了彩色图片。4月5日，北京公私合营京华胶印厂制版车间工人又试制成功了五百一十线的胶版，印出的“和平牡丹”画片，和画的一样。到7日，新华印刷厂也制成了五百线的胶版。
