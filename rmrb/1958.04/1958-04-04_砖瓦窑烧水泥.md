Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 2nd. A low-grade cement, simple to manufacture, inexpensive, and widely useful, has recently been produced in Shandan County using indigenous methods.

This low-grade cement is made by using local yellow clay to form adobe bricks. These are loaded into ordinary brick, tile, or lime kilns and heated to 600 to 800 degrees Celsius (equivalent to 70-80% of the heat used for firing bricks). After cooling, they are removed, ground into powder, and then mixed with 25%-30% lime powder and 5% gypsum powder. The properties of this cement make it ideally suited for constructing ditches, river dams, water conservancy projects, and building foundations. It is easy to apply, adheres firmly to bricks and stones, can resist seepage, and becomes even stronger over time in buildings that are frequently exposed to water and moisture. According to trials in Shandan County, the price per ton of this low-grade cement is only equal to the price per ton of lime.

Currently, Shandan County has dispatched cadres to actively prepare for the construction of a small cement plant with a daily output of twelve tons of low-grade cement.

    砖瓦窑烧水泥
    新华社兰州2日电　一种制造简便、费用小、用途大的低标号水泥，最近在山丹县用土法制成。
    这种低标号水泥，是取用当地的黄粘土做成土坯，装进普通烧砖瓦或烧石灰的窑里，加热到摄氏六百度到八百度（相当于烧砖瓦的七、八成火候），冷却后取出碾磨成粉，再加上25％到30％的石灰粉和5％的石膏粉混合拌匀即成。这种水泥的性能，最适宜于建筑沟渠、河坝、水利工程和建筑地基等，容易涂砌，又能与砖石粘得牢固，可以抵抗渗漏，在经常有水和潮湿的建筑物中，更是越久越坚固。根据山丹县的试制，每吨低标号水泥的价格只等于每吨石灰的价格。
    现在，山丹县已经抽调干部，积极筹建一座日产十二吨低标号水泥的小型水泥厂。
