    Resolving New Contradictions
    Wang Pu
    The three news items from Tianshui in Gansu, Leping in Jiangxi, and Panyu in Guangdong tell us that there are many difficulties and problems to be solved in the process of developing local industries, but they can also all be solved.
    Like other revolutionary work, developing local industries cannot be without difficulties. The so-called difficulties merely indicate that there are contradictions that have not been resolved. Contradiction is the life of the existence and development of all things; without contradiction, there would be no existence of things. Taking the development of local industries as an example, there are many current contradictions: the contradiction between advanced planning and backward measures, the contradiction between serving agricultural production and not serving agricultural production, the contradiction between new local industries and handicraft cooperatives in terms of production and sales, etc. Although the specific content of the contradictions may vary from place to place and from time to time, they all exist objectively, cannot be avoided, and cannot be shaken off. We must actively resolve these contradictions for local industries to develop smoothly. Some comrades think that after overthrowing conservative ideas and formulating advanced plans and a few measures, everything will be fine and they can rest easy. This is a naive idea and does not conform to the laws of the development of objective things.
    The opposing sides of a contradiction can be transformed into each other. Only seeing the opposing situation and not seeing that the opposing sides can be transformed will lead to helplessness. Recognizing that contradictions can be transformed will give us the courage to take action to promote its transformation, so that the problem can be solved. The Leping County Party Committee of Jiangxi Province discovered that some township and community industrial development plans had deviated from serving agricultural production, so they convened an industrial conference with the participation of district, township, and community cadres. After everyone discussed it, the deviation from serving agricultural production was transformed into its opposite, that is, serving agricultural production. The Panyu County Party Committee discovered the contradiction between the newly built local industries and the handicraft cooperatives and decided, on the principle of voluntariness, to transfer the handicraft cooperatives scattered in small rural market towns to agricultural cooperatives on the one hand, and to merge the handicraft cooperatives concentrated in the county seat on the other hand, so that they could manufacture some more complex agricultural tools, and the contradiction was easily resolved.
    As long as we acknowledge the inevitability of contradictions, pay attention to discovering contradictions at any time, and actively resolve contradictions, difficulties and problems cannot stop us from moving forward. What is frightening is closing our eyes and ears, and thinking that the world is at peace.

    解决新矛盾
    王朴
    甘肃天水、江西乐平和广东番禺的三条新闻，告诉我们在发展地方工业的道路上，有不少困难和问题需要解决，同时也都可以解决。
    像其它革命工作一样，发展地方工业不可能没有困难。所谓困难，无非说明有矛盾而没有解决。矛盾，是一切事物存在和发展的生命，没有矛盾就不会有事物的存在。拿发展地方工业来说，当前的矛盾就不少：先进规划与落后措施的矛盾，为农业生产服务与不为农业生产服务的矛盾，新的地方工业与手工业合作社在产销方面的矛盾等等。尽管矛盾的具体内容会因地而异，因时而异，但是，都是客观存在的，躲也躲不了，甩也甩不掉。必须主动地解决这些矛盾，地方工业才能顺利地发展。有些同志以为打倒了保守思想，订出了先进的规划和几条措施以后，就万事大吉，高枕无忧了。这是一种天真的想法，是不符合客观事物发展的规律的。
    矛盾着的对立面是可以互相转化的。只看到对立情况，看不到对立面可以转化，就会束手无策。而认识到矛盾可以转化，就会鼓起勇气动手去促进它的转化，使问题得以解决。江西省乐平县县委发现了有些乡社的发展工业计划，有违背为农业生产服务的偏向，就召开一个有区、乡、社干部参加的工业会议，大家讨论一番，违背为农业服务的偏向就向它的反面，即为农业生产服务的一面转化了。番禺县委发现新建的地方工业与手工业社的矛盾，决定在自愿的原则下，一方面把分散在农村小圩镇的手工业社下放到农业社去，一方面把集中在县城里的手工业社合并，使他们能够制造一些比较复杂的农具，矛盾也就迎刃而解了。
    只要承认矛盾的必然性，随时注意发现矛盾，主动解决矛盾，困难和问题是挡不住我们前进的。可怕的倒是闭目塞听，自以为天下太平。
