In the preparatory work for plowing, the Party branch of Chunhe Township, Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, calculated an account: activities such as harvesting minor crops, digging fields, accumulating and delivering fertilizer require a total of 76,216 laborers. Most of the township's male labor force was transferred to water conservancy projects, leaving 515 laborers at home, 80% of whom were women, accounting for about 26,000 laborers. The preparatory work for plowing was short by more than 50,000 laborers. In order to solve the problem of labor shortage, the Party branch put forward the action slogan of "Cartization in Seven Days." Since most of those at home were women, this task naturally fell on the women's shoulders.

Initially, many women lacked confidence in "cartization," saying, "We couldn't even handle a hoe handle in the past, how can we build a cart?" The carpenters said, "If everyone can be a carpenter, we won't be worth anything!" After calculating the labor force and organizing the women to visit and compare the efficiency of human carrying and cart pushing, it was found that a wheelbarrow could push 170 kilograms, which two bound-feet women could move, making it three to four times more efficient than human carrying. In this way, the women's enthusiasm was encouraged.

After the women were mobilized, inspiring stories of women learning technology to build wheelbarrows spread everywhere. Day and night, the sound of cart-making could be heard everywhere. Yang Lishi, 54 years old, made a cart in three days and two nights, and Nie Jinshi, over 70 years old, led her young granddaughter to work overnight. Those without tools used charcoal and pencils to draw lines, used kettle lids to draw circles, and used hemp ropes and wooden pieces as curved rulers; those without wood used old sedan chair poles, grass-carrying poles, and rafters as cart poles; loom ears were used as "hanging codes"; broken cabinets, boxes, and drawers were used as cart bodies; iron bars and iron rods were used as axles; some, in order to save time, chiseled a hole in a circular cutting board to make a wheel. In six days, the women had made 471 wheelbarrows with their own hands.

    六天造车四百多张
    在备耕工作中，云南省玉溪县春和乡党支部算了一笔账：小春收打、挖田、积送肥料等项生产活动，共需劳动力七万六千二百十六个，全乡的男劳动力大部抽去搞水利了，留在家的五百一十五个劳动力，80％都是妇女，约能出工二万六千个，备耕工作要差五万多个劳动力。为了解决劳动力紧张的问题，支部提出了“七天车子化”的行动口号。在家的既多是妇女，这个任务便很自然地落在妇女的头上。
    最初，很多妇女对“车子化”没有信心，说：“过去连锄头把都不会逗，能打什么车？”木匠则说：“人人能当木匠，我们就不值钱啰！”经过算劳动力的账，又组织妇女们参观对比了人挑和车推的工效：一张手推车能推一百七十公斤，两个小脚妇女就弄动了，比人挑效率高三倍至四倍。这样，妇女们的劲头便被鼓舞起来了。
    妇女发动起来后，到处传遍了妇女学技术造推车的动人事迹。白天黑夜到处是叮叮噹噹的打车声，五十四岁的杨李氏三天两夜打了一张车，七十多岁的聂金氏领着小孙女连夜干。没有工具的，就用木炭、铅笔划线条，用水壶盖比着划圆圈，用麻线、木片当弯尺；没有木料就用旧轿杠、挑草杠、槫子做车杠；织布机的耳朵做“吊码”；破柜子、箱子、抽屉做车身；用铁棒、铁棍做轴心；有的为了赶时间，就把圆形的切菜板凿个洞做轮子。六天的时间，妇女们已亲手做出四百七十一张手推车。
