Why do people suddenly cough and choke when eating or drinking?

　　In the human throat, there are two passages: the one in front is called the respiratory tract, which leads directly to the trachea and lungs, and the one behind is called the digestive tract, which leads to the stomach. When eating or drinking, the respiratory tract in front very sensitively and immediately closes the passage (glottis) tightly and lifts upward, so that food or water can pass smoothly and enter the digestive tract behind.

　　If you drink water very quickly, the glottis will not have time to close, and the water will fall into the respiratory tract. However, the respiratory tract only allows air to flow and does not allow any foreign objects to enter. Coughing and choking is precisely its instinct to expel foreign objects.

　　Also, if you talk and laugh while eating, it is easy to cough and choke, because talking and laughing requires deep inhalation, so the glottis is wide open. When food passes through at this time, it will of course fall in. The respiratory tract immediately exerts its instinct, which is a violent cough.

　　The result of coughing is generally to expel foreign objects. If it cannot be expelled, people will experience breathing difficulties and suffocation, and they have to go to the hospital immediately (now the hospital can use tweezers to remove these foreign objects). Among such patients in the hospital, two- and three-year-old children are the most numerous. Doctors often remove peanuts, melon seeds, soybeans, and even glass balls, screws, small whistles, and other objects from their small respiratory tracts. This should attract the attention of parents.

    人在吃饭喝水时突然咳嗽发呛
    人的咽喉处有两条管道：前面一条叫呼吸道，直通气管到肺脏，后面一条叫消化道，直通到胃。在吃喝的时候，前面的呼吸道非常灵敏的就立刻把道口（声门）紧紧的关闭起来，同时向上举起，好让食物或水顺利地通过而进入后条消化道。
    如果喝水特别快，声门来不及关闭，水就会落进呼吸道里去。但呼吸道是只容许空气流动，决不容许任何异物窜入的。发呛咳嗽正是它驱逐异物的本能。
    又如果边吃饭边谈笑，也容易发呛咳嗽，因为谈笑的时候需要大吸气，所以声门大开放，这时食物经过，当然就掉进去。呼吸道立时发挥本能，便是一阵猛烈的咳嗽。
    咳嗽的结果，一般是能把异物排除出去的。如果一直排不出来，人就会发生呼吸困难和别不过气来的现象，只得赶紧上医院（现在医院里能用镊子钳出这些异物）。医院里的这类病人，以两、三岁的小儿为最多。医生常从他们细小的呼吸道里钳出花生米、瓜子、黄豆，甚至玻璃球、螺丝钉，小哨子等物，这是值得引起家长们注意的。
