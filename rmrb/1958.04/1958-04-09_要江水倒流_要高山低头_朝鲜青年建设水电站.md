Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 7th: The first group of over 600 Korean youths who volunteered to participate in the construction of the Jiangjie Hydropower Station will depart from Pyongyang for Jiangjie on the 8th. Nearly a thousand young people and students in Pyongyang held a gathering tonight to warmly send off this youth shock brigade.

Li Xiaochun, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, and Kim Doo-sam, Minister of Electricity, encouraged the young people at the send-off meeting to train themselves in this new "university." The Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Youth League presented a league flag to this youth shock brigade. Representatives of these youths stated at the meeting that they would definitely practice strict economy and complete the construction task ahead of schedule.

The Jiangjie Hydropower Station, which is about to begin construction, is a magnificent project. After the completion of this power station, it will be able to generate 1.3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The earthwork alone in the construction project will be more than 1.7 million cubic meters. This project will reverse the flow of the Changjin River and divert it through a tunnel more than 100 kilometers long into the Tulu River. After the completion of this project, in addition to using hydropower for electricity generation, it will also enable water transportation between Jiangjie and Hamhung, which are separated by towering mountains.

The Korean Youth Socialist Builders Congress, held not long ago, made a resolution to have Korean youth fully undertake the construction task of this major project. In order to encourage the patriotic actions of the young people, the Republic government named this hydropower station "Jiangjie Youth Power Station." Now, tens of thousands of young people in northern Korea have signed up to participate in this construction project.

    要江水倒流　要高山低头
    朝鲜青年建设水电站
    新华社平壤7日电　朝鲜第一批志愿参加江界水力发电站建设的六百多个青年将在8日从平壤启程去江界。平壤市近千名青年和学生今晚集会热烈欢送这批青年突击队。
    朝鲜劳动党中央常务委员李孝淳和电气相金斗三在欢送会上勉励青年们到这座新的“大学”中去锻炼自己。朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会副委员长，把一面盟旗授给这个青年突击队。这批青年的代表在会上表示一定要厉行节约，提前完成建设任务。
    即将开工兴建的江界水力发电站是一项规模宏伟的工程。这个发电站建成以后，每年能够发电十三亿瓩时。建设工程中单是土方工程就有一百七十多万立方。这个工程要使长津江的水倒流，通过一百多公里长的隧道，引入秃鲁江。这项工程完成后，除了可以利用水力发电外，还可以使被丛山峻岭隔开的江界和咸兴之间通水运。
    不久以前举行的朝鲜青年社会主义建设者大会曾经作出决议，决定由朝鲜青年全部担负这项大工程的建设任务。共和国政府为了鼓励青年们的爱国行动，把这个水电站命名为“江界青年发电站”。现在朝鲜北部已经有成千上万的青年报名要参加这项建设工程。
