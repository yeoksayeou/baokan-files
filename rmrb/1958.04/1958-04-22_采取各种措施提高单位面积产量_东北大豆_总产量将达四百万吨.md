Taking Various Measures to Increase Yield Per Unit Area
"Northeast Soybean" Total Output Will Reach Four Million Tons

(Our report) The famous Northeast soybean will be planted on more than 46 million mu in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces this year, with a planned total output of nearly four million tons, an increase of more than 700,000 tons over last year. In the southernmost Liaodong Peninsula, soybean planting has already begun, while in the northernmost Heilongjiang Province, preparations for spring planting are in full swing.

Various measures are being adopted in various regions to increase soybean yield per unit area. Heilongjiang Province, which accounts for about half of the three provinces' output, will plant more than 90% of its soybeans with improved varieties this year, and almost all of them have been sorted by grain size, with many agricultural cooperatives sorting them twice. In addition to "Mancangjin," the improved varieties include "Zihua No. 4" and "Xibiwa," both of which are early-maturing and high-yielding varieties, planted according to their characteristics in areas with more rainfall and areas that are slightly drier, respectively. This year's new varieties also include "Jingshan Pu" soybeans, which were further developed from "Mancangjin," "Ke-series 283," which matures a few days earlier than "Zihua No. 4," and "Heilongjiang No. 41," which was introduced from the Soviet Union and is suitable for planting in northern regions. Most of the land prepared for soybean planting was plowed in the autumn last year and will be planted using new-style animal-powered farm implements. Due to the abundance of manure fertilizer this year, the soybean planting technique promotes reasonable sparse planting. In the case of abundant manure fertilizer, these planting methods can prevent soybeans from growing too lushly and allow each soybean plant to have more branches and pods. This year, some soybean fields will also be planted using irrigated methods. Based on these measures, there is confidence that the soybean yield per unit area will increase by about 12% to 20% compared to last year.

Jilin Province originally planned a total soybean output of 990,000 tons this year, but after discussions among farmers in various regions, this was increased to 1,210,000 tons. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions are taking various measures to ensure a bumper soybean harvest this year. Inoculating soybean seeds with rhizobia will account for more than 60% of this year's soybean planting area. To eliminate insect pests, 2.25 million mu of soybeans will also be treated with the pesticide "666." The amount of fertilizer applied per mu of soybean land is generally one to two times higher than last year.

Liaoning Province plans to intercrop and mix-plant all of its more than 10 million mu of soybeans with corn this year. Throughout the province, townships and cooperatives are universally using soybean planters and soybean hole-punching planters created by farmers in Qingyuan and Xifeng counties. According to a survey by the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture, spot-planting soybeans can generally increase production by 20% to 30%. In addition to the abundance of water and fertilizer this year and the promotion of soybean topping techniques, the adoption of intercropping and mixed-planting methods can not only increase soybean production but also increase grain production.

### 采取各种措施提高单位面积产量  “东北大豆”总产量将达四百万吨

    采取各种措施提高单位面积产量
    “东北大豆”总产量将达四百万吨
    本报讯　著名的东北大豆，今年在黑龙江、吉林、辽宁三省计划播种四千六百多万亩，计划总产量近四百万吨，比去年增加七十多万吨。最南部的辽东半岛，大豆播种已经开始，最北部的黑龙江省正是备耕的最紧张阶段。
    各地正采用各种措施提高大豆单位面积产量。产量占三省大约一半的黑龙江省，今年播种的大豆，90％以上全是良种，而且基本都经过粒选，有不少农业社还精选两遍。良种中除了“满仓金”以外，还有“紫花四号”和“西比瓦”，这两种都是早熟丰产的品种，分别按它们的特性种植在降雨较多的地区和稍旱的地区。今年推广的新品种，还有从“满仓金”进一步培育出来的“荆山扑”大豆，比“紫花四号”还能早熟几天的“克系二八三”，和由苏联引进的适于北部地区种植的“黑龙江41号”。准备播种大豆的土地大部分在去年进行了秋翻，将使用新式畜力农具播种。由于今年粪肥多，大豆播种技术推广合理稀植。这些种植法在粪肥多的情况下，可以防止大豆贪青，并且可以使每株大豆杈多荚多。今年一部分大豆地还要用水浇地的办法种植。根据这些措施，大豆单位面积产量，有把握比去年提高12％到20％左右。
    吉林省原订今年大豆总产量计划是九十九万吨，经过各地农民讨论，提高到一百二十一万吨。各地农业社正在采取多种措施，使今年的大豆丰产。用根瘤菌拌种大豆，将占今年大豆播种面积60％强。为了消灭虫害，还有二百二十五万亩大豆要用农药“六六六”拌种。大豆地每亩的施肥量普遍比去年增加一倍到两倍。
    辽宁省今年计划播种的一千多万亩大豆，全部和玉米间作混种，全省乡乡社社普遍使用清原、西丰两县农民创造的大豆点播机和大豆扎眼点播器播种。据辽宁省农业厅调查，点播大豆一般可增产20％到30％。加上今年水粪足和推广大豆摘心技术，再采取间作混种的办法，既可增产大豆，又可增产粮食。
