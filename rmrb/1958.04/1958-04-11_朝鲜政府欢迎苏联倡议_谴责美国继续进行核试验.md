Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 10th. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement, expressing a warm welcome and support for the Soviet government's decision to unilaterally cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea believes that the Soviet government's measure to unilaterally cease atomic and hydrogen weapon testing has made a new and significant contribution to the cause of consolidating world peace and security. This Soviet measure has created favorable conditions for reaching an international agreement on a comprehensive cessation of nuclear weapon testing. The statement said that the solution to this problem now depends on the United States and the United Kingdom. Today, the United States and the United Kingdom are undergoing a severe test in the eyes of people around the world.

The statement condemned the United States for continuing nuclear weapon tests on Pacific islands, as well as arming West Germany with nuclear weapons. The statement said that the United States is also blatantly violating the Korean Armistice Agreement by transporting atomic weapons into South Korea in order to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea and exacerbate tensions in the Far East.

The statement said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea demands that the United States and the United Kingdom respond to the Soviet initiative so that this effective measure to save humanity from the threat of atomic war can be realized.

    新华社平壤10日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府今天发表声明，表示热烈欢迎和支持苏联政府单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器的决定。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为，苏联政府单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验的措施对巩固世界和平和安全的事业作出了新的巨大贡献。苏联的这个措施为就全面停止核武器试验达成国际协议创造了有利的条件。声明说，今后这个问题的解决要看美国和英国。今天，美国和英国在全世界人民面前经受着严重的考验。
    声明谴责美国要在太平洋岛屿上继续进行核武器试验，以及以核武器武装西德的行为。声明说，美国还粗暴地破坏朝鲜停战协定，把原子武器运进南朝鲜，以阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，加剧远东的紧张局势。
    声明说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府要求美国和英国响应苏联的倡议，以使这种从原子战争威胁下拯救人类的有效措施得以实现。
