    Some suggestions for the People's Railway Publishing House
    In order to better improve the publishing work, I would like to offer some suggestions to the People's Railway Publishing House for reference. It should be affirmed that the publishing house has done a lot of work in publishing various books and introducing advanced Soviet science and technology works, but there are shortcomings. For example, the book "Railway Design Data" published in December 1957, translated by Wang Zhuting and Huang Guozhen, has very difficult-to-understand words and sentences, and some nouns and terms are crudely made. For example, the translation of the first sentence of the introduction is "The Soviet Union (and our country is the same) invests a lot of funds in basic construction, and most of the funds become the expansion of national wealth, the material basis for the systematic improvement of people's lives, and the strengthening of national defense forces." This sentence is a Chinese sentence completely translated according to Russian, and this is just one example. There are also randomly created nouns. Such as continuous and long restricted gradients; transition platforms for convex parts of longitudinal sections; easing gradients; superstructure; artificial structures; powerful articulated locomotives, etc.

### 向人民铁道出版社提些意见

    向人民铁道出版社提些意见
    为了更好地改进出版工作，我想给人民铁道出版社提出一些意见作为参考。应当肯定，该出版社在出版各类书籍，介绍苏联的先进科学技术著作方面做了很多工作，但有缺点，例如1957年12月份出版的由王竹亭、黄国桢译的“铁路设计资料”一书，其中的词句非常难懂，有些名词术语是粗制滥造。如绪论第一句的译文是“苏联（我国也是这样）在基本建设上投入大量的资金，资金的大部分成为国家财富的扩大，成为人民生活系统地提高的物质基础，成为国防力量的加强。”这句话完全是按俄文照译的中国话，这只是其中的一个例子。还有乱造的名词。如持续绵长的限制坡度；纵断面的凸部的介坡平台；缓和坡度；上部构造；人工建筑物；强力的活节式机车等。
