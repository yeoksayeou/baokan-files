Behind the Scenes

    The Road is Made by Walking
    We have seen many agricultural cooperatives' grain production increase plans, but fewer agricultural cooperatives' livestock increase plans. This may be because it is difficult to ask higher authorities and other regions for assistance if grain production does not increase; while if livestock is insufficient, you can pay to buy it.

    It is necessary for pastoral areas to support agricultural areas with livestock, and for various regions to carry out livestock adjustments in a planned way; it is also necessary for agricultural cooperatives to increase their purchase of livestock to meet their own needs. However, it is wrong to rely solely on external assistance and not carry out breeding.

    Wushan County in Gansu Province has always been a region with undeveloped livestock, and the increase in large livestock is particularly slow, increasing by only 6% each year. However, the leaders of Wushan County did not look upwards or reach out for external help, but instead resolved to lead the masses in breeding. After several years of exploration, they finally opened up a new way to breed livestock - cooperative-run ranches. This is a spirit full of creativity. With this spirit, no matter how rugged the road ahead, a broad avenue will be opened up.

    路是人走出来的
    我们看到了许多农业社的粮食增产计划，但较少看到农业社的牲畜增产计划。这也许是粮食没有增产便难于向上级向别的地区要；而牲畜不足则可以掏钱去买的缘故。
    牧业区把牲畜支援农业区，各地区有计划地进行牲畜调剂，是必要的；农业社适应自己的需要增购牲畜也是必要的。但是单纯依赖外援，不去进行繁殖，这种态度却是不对的。
    甘肃武山县一向是一个牲畜不发展的地区，大牲畜增殖尤其慢，每年只增殖6％。但是武山县的领导上眼睛没有向上，手没有伸向外，而是下决心领导群众进行繁殖，经过几年摸索，终于开辟了新的繁殖牲畜的途径——社办牧场。这是一种富于创造的精神，有了这种精神，前途再崎岖，也会开辟出来康庄大道来。
