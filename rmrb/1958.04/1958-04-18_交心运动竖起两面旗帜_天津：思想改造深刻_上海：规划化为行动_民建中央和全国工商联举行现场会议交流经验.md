Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th - Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: At the on-site meeting for exchanging experiences in self-remolding of industry and commerce circles, convened by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association Rectification Work Committee, Wang Guangying, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Hu Juewen, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, introduced the situation and experience of the heart-to-heart movement in Tianjin's industry and commerce circles and the drafting of remolding plans in Shanghai's industry and commerce circles. Judging from what they introduced, the two regions have their own characteristics, and combining them provides a relatively complete experience for the current deepening of the rectification movement by industrialists and businessmen.

If the industrial and commercial circles want to truly make a great leap forward and be reborn, they must first break with capitalism, completely pour out the dirty things of capitalism in their minds, cut off the roots of capitalism, and turn two hearts into one. This is the experience of Tianjin. After nearly a year of the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification movement, the vast majority of people in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles received extremely profound education, realized that they still had varying degrees of negative aspects leading to capitalism, and basically had not abandoned the capitalist stand, feeling very dangerous. Some people said: "After the General Line was announced, we boarded the ship with our private goods. Now that the ship is about to enter the port, if we don't throw away the private goods, we won't be able to get ashore." Others said: "It's time to open the skylight and speak frankly. How can we be of one heart with the Party if we keep the dirty things of capitalism in our hearts?" They had the desire to change their political stance and undergo a rebirth. Since the beginning of this year, a magnificent and heroic new situation of a socialist great leap forward has emerged across the country, which has further promoted the rectification movement of industrialists and businessmen. Therefore, starting from March, a high tide of heart-to-heart talks with the Party and the people was quickly set off in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles. The vast majority of industrialists and businessmen scrambled to examine their capitalist thoughts and deeds, pouring out the disreputable capitalist dirty things that had been hidden in their hearts for a long time. However, some people were quite contradictory in the process of heart-to-heart talks. On the one hand, they felt that they had to dig out capitalist ideas, but on the other hand, they were afraid of pain, afraid of losing face, and afraid that the Party and the people would not trust them. After a fierce ideological struggle, the correct aspect finally prevailed. As of now, more than 36,000 industrialists and businessmen in the city who have participated in the rectification have revealed thoughts and deeds that are unfavorable to socialism, ranging from the early days of liberation to after the rectification debate. Now, the movement has developed to a deeper stage, and all industrialists and businessmen have begun to conduct self-analysis and self-criticism of these capitalist thoughts they have handed over, and help each other improve their understanding and ideology.

After industrialists and businessmen have expressed their innermost thoughts to the Party and the people, they need to further establish socialist ideas. The personal transformation plan created by Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles provides experience in this regard. More than 26,000 industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai who have participated in the first and second batches of rectification, some absorbed the experience of Tianjin and also carried out the heart-to-heart movement, and others, although they did not express their innermost thoughts, also conducted political and ideological self-examination. On this basis, they have successively formulated plans to accelerate their self-transformation, and through the plan, they have consolidated their ideological understanding improved in the rectification, and put forward clear goals and directions for future transformation. Everyone's plans are generally made more carefully, especially the three slogans created by the masses, "Is it like, is it feasible, is it ruthless," which played a great role. "Like" refers to whether the plan is like the person, "feasible" refers to whether the content is practical and feasible, and "ruthless" depends on the determination of the transformation.

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Rectification Work Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce grasped the plan as the key, so that the self-transformation of industrialists and businessmen can have clear requirements and specific measures to achieve these requirements, and make their enthusiasm for the Great Leap Forward into practical action. Now these more than 26,000 people have initially achieved some results in implementing the plan. First of all, there has been a concrete manifestation of accepting the leadership of the Party and public representatives, thereby improving the relationship between public and private sectors. One capitalist originally had a resistant attitude towards the public representative, and the relationship between the public and private sectors was extremely abnormal. This time, in response to his own problems, he first included accepting the leadership of the public representative into his personal plan. Afterwards, in addition to accepting and respecting the leadership of the public representative in action, he also signed a bilateral contract with the public deputy manager, asking the public representative to help him study and improve his political ideology. He guaranteed to teach the public representative the theoretical knowledge of glass industrial production within a year and a half. Secondly, there has been a concrete manifestation of getting closer to the working masses, thereby improving the relationship with the working masses. After a private person from a glass factory returned to the factory after completing the plan, he went to the workshop to work with the workers. He saw that the workers were too tired to blow light bulbs with their mouths and the output was low, so he researched and successfully changed to using an automated method to blow light bulbs, which greatly reduced the labor intensity of the workers, and his relationship with the workers was also improved. At the same time, private personnel with technology actively contributed their talents. A private engineer in a factory had always been energetic in his work before the joint venture, but his enthusiasm for work declined after the joint venture. This time, he realized that it was because his position had not changed and he did not have the idea of serving the people, so he proposed in the plan to contribute his technical talents. Recently, when the superior company asked him to design a new type of pump suitable for rural use, he received a call at 3:00 p.m., and after designing it overnight, he came up with a draft the next day. In addition, they have also begun to show good performance in changing the special nature of their lifestyles, shortening the distance with the working people, and participating in labor exercises.

In the introductions of Wang Guangying and Hu Juewen, they both put forward these important experiences: The self-transformation movement of the industrial and commercial circles should be based on the improvement of ideological understanding, so it is necessary to deepen and thoroughly carry out ideological work in the process of the movement, and promptly resolve all their ideological concerns, so that every industrialist and businessman can consciously and willingly express their innermost thoughts to the Party and the people and formulate their own transformation plan. However, it is not enough to have the consciousness of the industrialists and businessmen, but also to rely closely on the leadership of the Party and the help of the workers and masses, otherwise there can be no major achievements. Tianjin's heart-to-heart movement has obtained the leadership of the Party organizations at all levels of the city, district, and enterprise at each different stage, so the direction is clear and the principles and policies are clear. The employees of each enterprise also gave great support and encouragement to the private personnel. Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles also strive for the leadership of the Party and the working class. They all report their transformation plans to the Party organizations of their respective enterprises, and post the plans in the form of big-character posters, asking the public representatives and all employees to help and supervise the implementation at any time.

    交心运动竖起两面旗帜
    天津：思想改造深刻　上海：规划化为行动
    民建中央和全国工商联举行现场会议交流经验
    新华社天津17日电　新华社记者报道：在民建中央和全国工商联整风工作委员会召开的工商界自我改造经验交流现场会议上，天津市工商联副主任委员王光英和上海市工商联副主任委员胡厥文分别介绍了天津工商界交心运动和上海工商界订改造规划的情况和经验。从他们介绍的情况看来，两地区各有特点，结合起来就为当前工商业者进一步深入开展整风运动提供了比较完整的经验。
    工商界要真正大跃进，要脱胎换骨，必须首先破资本主义，把思想上的资本主义的肮脏东西完全倒出来，挖断资本主义的根，把两条心变成一条心。这是天津的经验。天津市工商界经过将近一年的反右派斗争和整风运动，绝大多数人受到了极为深刻的教育，认识到自己身上还存在着不同程度的通向资本主义的消极一面，基本上没有抛弃资本主义立场，感到十分危险。有人说：“总路线公布后，我们就带着私货上了船，如今船已快进港了，再不把私货扔掉，就上不了岸了”。还有人说：“到了打开天窗说亮话的时候了，把资本主义脏东西窝在心里，怎么能和党一条心呢”？他们有了改变政治立场进行脱胎换骨的要求。今年以来，全国范围内出现了波澜壮阔、雄伟豪迈的社会主义大跃进的新形势，又进一步推动了工商业者的整风运动。于是从3月份开始，天津市工商界迅速掀起了一个向党向人民交心的高潮。绝大多数工商业者争先恐后地检查自己的资本主义思想和言行，把长期蕴藏在内心的见不得人的资本主义肮脏东西倾囊倒出。但是，也有些人在交心过程中心情相当矛盾，一方面感到要挖资本主义思想才行，另一方面又怕痛，怕丢面子，怕党和人民不信任。在经过激烈的思想斗争以后，正确的方面终于战胜了。截至目前，全市参加整风的三万六千多个工商业者，已经揭露出远自解放初期、近至整风辩论之后的不利于社会主义的思想言行。现在，运动已发展到更深入的阶段，全体工商业者开始对自己交出来的这些资本主义思想，进行自我分析自我批判，相互帮助提高认识，提高思想。
    工商业者向党向人民交了心以后，还需要进一步确立社会主义思想。上海工商界创造的订个人改造规划正好提供了这方面的经验。上海已经参加第一、第二批整风的二万六千多个工商业者，一部分吸收了天津的经验也开展了交心运动，另外一部分虽然没有交心，但也进行了政治思想的检查。他们在这样的基础上，纷纷订立加紧自我改造的规划，通过规划把自己在整风中提高了的思想认识巩固起来，并为今后的改造提出了明确的目标和努力方向。各人的规划一般都订得比较认真，特别是群众创造的“像不像、行不行、狠不狠”三句口号起了很大作用，“像”就是指所订规划像不像其人，“行”指内容是否切实可行，“狠”是看改造的决心如何。
    民建上海市委和上海市工商联整风工作委员会抓住了规划这个纲，使工商业者的自我改造能够有明确的要求和实现这些要求的具体措施，使他们跃进的热情成为实际行动。现在这二万六千多人在执行规划方面已初步取得了一些成效。首先是对接受党和公方代表的领导有了具体表现，从而改善了公私关系。有一个资本家原来对公方代表有抵触情绪，公私关系极不正常。这次他针对自己的问题，把接受公方代表的领导首先订到个人规划中去，事后他除在行动上接受和尊重公方代表领导外，还和公方副经理签订双边合同，请公方代表帮助他学习和提高政治思想。他保证在一年半内教公方代表学会玻璃工业生产的理论知识。其次是同工人群众接近有了具体表现，从而改善了与工人群众的关系。一个玻璃厂的私方人员在订完规划回到厂里后，就下车间和工人一起劳动，他看到工人用嘴巴吹灯泡太吃力，产量又低，就研究成功改用自动化的方法吹灯泡，工人劳动强度大大减轻，他和工人的关系也改善了。同时，有技术的私方人员积极贡献出自己的才能。一个厂的私方工程师在企业合营前工作一贯起劲，合营后工作热情低落。这次认识到是自己的立场没有转变，没有为人民服务的思想，因而在规划中提出要贡献自己的技术才能。最近当上级公司要他设计一种适合农村使用的新性能泵浦时，他下午三点钟接到电话，经过一夜设计，第二天就把草样拿出来了。此外，在改变生活作风的特殊化、缩短和劳动人民的距离、参加劳动锻炼等方面，他们也都开始有良好的表现。
    在王光英和胡厥文的介绍中，都提出了这样一些重要的体会：工商界的自我改造运动应当建立在思想认识提高的基础上，因而必须在运动过程中把思想工作作深作透，及时解决一切他们的思想顾虑，让每个工商业者都自觉自愿地向党向人民交心和订立自己的改造规划。可是，光有工商业者的自觉还不够，还必须紧紧依靠党的领导和工人群众的帮助，否则是不可能有重大成就的。天津的交心运动在每个不同的阶段都取得了市、区和企业各级党组织的领导，因此方向明确，方针政策明确。各企业的职工并给了私方人员很大的支持与鼓励。上海工商界也同样争取党和工人阶级的领导，他们都向本企业党组织汇报自己的改造规划，并把规划用大字报形式张贴出来，请公方代表和全体职工随时帮助和监督实行。
