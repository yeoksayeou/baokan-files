Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 9th: TASS, New York, April 9th: AFL-CIO President Meany, commenting on the unemployment figures released yesterday by the US Labor Department and the Commerce Department, told reporters: "The materials introducing the employment and unemployment situation in March indicate that the recession is deepening further. Regrettably, the government's report does not point out in any way that the recession has reached its lowest point, let alone any signs of a start to prosperity.

"According to official materials, from February to March, the number of unemployed increased by 25,000, while at this time, the number of unemployed usually decreases by about 200,000. Taking seasonal factors into consideration, the unemployment rate still increased from 6.7% of the total workforce in February to 7% in March."

He finally emphasized, "There is not a shred of hope in the government's report today. We should not think that these figures will cheer anyone up, especially when business owners' orders, retail trade, industrial production, and consumers' incomes continue to shrink... Optimistic talk is only for newspapers to publish."

    美国经济病势加重
    劳联——产联主席米尼表示悲观
    新华社10日讯　塔斯社纽约9日讯：美国劳联—产联主席米尼就美国劳工部和商务部昨天发表的关于失业情况的材料对各报记者发表谈话说：“介绍3月份就业情况和失业情况的材料，说明衰退进一步加深。遗憾的是，政府的报告根本就没有指出衰退已到了最低点，更谈不上什么开始繁荣的征象了。
    “根据官方材料，从2月到3月，失业人数增加了两万五千人，而在这个时间，失业人数通常大概要减少二十万人。在考虑到季节性因素的情况下，失业人数还是从2月份占工人总数的6.7％，增加到3月份的7％。”
    他最后着重指出，“在政府今天的报告中，没有丝毫的希望。我们不应当认为，这些数字会使谁感到振奋，特别是在企业主的定货单、零售贸易额、工业生产和消费者的收入继续不断缩减的情况下……乐观的谈话只是供报纸发的。”
