	Hydrogen Bombs and Red Moons
	The People's Daily reported on April 6th: Londoners held a "No Hydrogen Bomb" march, "Marchers...carried their children on their backs, and some pushed baby carriages." I feel sorry for the British children. Before they even learn to read, they already feel the threat of hydrogen bombs, just as they taste the bitterness of hunger at such a young age.

	Coincidentally, turning to the supplement of the same day's newspaper, there is a painting by a seven-year-old child: "Red Sun and Red Moon." A seven-year-old child may not know much about artificial satellites, but he knows it's a good thing. So he painted it together with the bright sun, the airplanes in the sky, the houses on the shore, and the ships in the river.

	I am happy for the talent of this seven-year-old child, and I am even more proud of the happy life of Chinese children. (Huai)

    氢弹和红月亮
    4月6日人民日报载：伦敦人民举行“不要氢弹”的大游行，“游行者……背着他们的孩子，有的人推着婴儿车。”我为英国孩子难过，在没有认识字的时候，就先感到氢弹的威胁，正如他们小小年纪就尝尽了饥饿的苦味一样。
    巧得很，翻到同天报纸副刊，上有一张七岁孩子的画：“红太阳和红月亮”。七岁孩子对人造卫星自然未必知道得多少，但他知道这是个好东西。所以他把它同明亮的太阳，天空中的飞机，岸上的房子和河里的轮船画在一起。
    我为这个七岁孩子的才能高兴，我更为中国孩子的幸福生活骄傲。　　　（怀）
