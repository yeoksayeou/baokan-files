    The "Zhonghua" Premium Drawing Pencils Should Improve Quality
    We are architectural engineering designers and use the "Zhonghua" premium drawing pencils produced by China Pencil Company every day. We have found the following shortcomings in these pencils: First, the wood quality is poor, making it difficult to sharpen. Applying too much force causes large pieces to split off. Second, the hardness of the lead does not match the specifications stipulated for the grade. Some 3H pencils are softer than HB, and some are harder than 4H pencils. Third, the lead is not wear-resistant. When drawing long lines, the front end becomes thin and the back end becomes thick, resulting in uneven lines. Sharpening pencils takes a lot of time and affects work efficiency. We hope that China Pencil Company will improve these shortcomings and improve the quality of the pencils. He Bozong and 7 others

    中华高级绘图铅笔应该提高质量
    我们是建筑工程设计人员，天天使用中国铅笔公司出产的中华高级绘图铅笔。我们发现这种铅笔的缺点第一是木质不好，削的时候很费力，用力过大就劈下来一大块。第二是铅条的软硬不合牌号所规定的规格。有的3H铅笔比HB还软、有的比4H铅笔还硬。第三是铅条不耐磨，画长线时，前段细后段粗，线条不均匀。削铅笔要占用不少时间，影响工作效率。我们希望中国铅笔公司改进这几种缺点，提高铅笔质量。	  何伯宗等八人
