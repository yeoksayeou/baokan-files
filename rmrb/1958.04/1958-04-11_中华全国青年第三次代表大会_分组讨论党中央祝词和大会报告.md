Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: The Third National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation held group meetings today to discuss the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the congress and the report of the Second Committee of the All-China Youth Federation to the congress.

Wang Chengliang, a representative of the youth unity furnace workers from the Second Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, said that in the Great Leap Forward in production, our youth unity furnace proposed to increase steel production by 40,000 tons for the country this year. Through the efforts of all young workers, we have already increased production by 10,000 tons in the first quarter. But we will never be complacent and will continue to leap forward. Saiyiding Aishan, an oil worker from Karamay, and Wu Keguang, an advanced producer from Chongqing, both pledged to complete their production plans ahead of schedule in response to the Central Committee's concern for the youth.

Zhang Kaiyuan, a lecturer from Central China Normal College who was sent to the countryside for labor training three months ago, said during the discussion that ideological transformation must have a high degree of consciousness. We must actively and resolutely struggle against bourgeois ideology. Otherwise, even if the Party arranges a good environment for ideological transformation for you, it will not achieve the desired results. Hu Rongrong, a dance worker from Shanghai, said that after the Rectification Campaign, many dancers in Shanghai have begun to go to the countryside, factories, and troops to participate in labor and perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers. In this process, we have also transformed ourselves. Rong Hongren, a young capitalist, said that for the bourgeoisie, the most important thing at present is to transform their standpoint. They must resolutely leap from a capitalist standpoint to a socialist standpoint.

Representatives generally believed in the discussion that strengthening the unity of youth from all sectors and ethnic groups across the country, as proposed in the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the congress report, is very important. Many representatives of minority ethnic youth believe that to strengthen national unity, it is currently necessary to focus on criticizing local nationalism tendencies.

    中华全国青年第三次代表大会
    分组讨论党中央祝词和大会报告
    据新华社10日讯　中华全国青年第三次代表大会今天分组举行会议，讨论中共中央向大会的祝词和全国青联第二届委员会向大会的报告。
    鞍钢第二炼钢厂青年团结炉工人代表王成良说，我们青年团结炉在生产大跃进中提出今年要为国家增产四万吨钢，经过全体青年工人的努力，第一季度已经增产了一万吨。但我们决不骄傲，还要跃进再跃进。来自克拉玛依的石油工人赛衣丁艾山和重庆的先进生产者吴克光都保证要提前完成生产计划，回答党中央对青年的关怀。
    三个月前下放到农村去劳动锻炼的华中师范学院讲师章开源在讨论时说，改造思想必须有高度的自觉性，主动地、顽强地同资产阶级思想作斗争，否则即使党给你安排了很好的改造思想的环境，也不能收到应有的效果。上海市舞蹈工作者胡蓉蓉说，在整风运动以后，上海许多舞蹈演员已经开始下乡、下厂、下部队参加劳动和为工农兵演出，在这个过程中也改造了我们自己。青年资本家荣鸿仁说，对于资产阶级来说，目前最主要的是改造立场的问题，要痛下决心从资本主义立场跃进到社会主义立场上来。
    代表们在讨论中普遍认为中共中央祝词和大会报告中提出的加强国内各界和各民族青年的团结是十分重要的。许多少数民族青年代表认为，要加强民族团结目前必须着重批判地方民族主义倾向。
