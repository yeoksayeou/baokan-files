Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 16th: Nearly eight hundred scientific workers and active innovators in industrial and agricultural production from Guangdong Province gathered on the 15th at the newly opened Guangdong Science Hall for the province's first scientific work conference, to discuss the Great Leap Forward in scientific and technological research in Guangdong.

Du Guoxiang, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Science Work Committee, said in his opening speech that this conference will focus on discussing the outline of the scientific and technological research work plan for the province from 1958 to 1962, especially for 1958, in order to start solving the urgent problems raised in current production and serve the Great Leap Forward in production.

Fan Changjiang, Secretary-General of the State Council's Science Planning Commission, and Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, both congratulated the conference and spoke at the meeting. Fan Changjiang said in his speech that both local and central authorities bear significant responsibilities for scientific and technological research, and the trend of future development indicates that local authorities will have even greater tasks. He believes that the key to achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results in scientific research work lies first in clarifying the purpose of science serving production. He said that science serving production is not only a requirement of the current Great Leap Forward in production, but also historically the mission of science. The economy is the foundation of society, and science is its superstructure. Science must reflect it and promote its advancement, otherwise science will sooner or later be abandoned by it. When science and technology are put into the struggle for production, scientific work becomes lively and vigorous, scientists are more welcomed and loved by the masses, and their prestige is also enhanced. When talking about how to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results in scientific work, and the importance of following the mass line, Fan Changjiang said that for science to follow the mass line, it is first necessary to break superstitions. Science is not superstitious, but people have some superstitious views about science, seeing it as somewhat mysterious. In previous years, when discussing industrial issues, it seemed that there was a saying that only a few experts could engage in it, but practice in recent years has proved that industry is not so mysterious. In fact, science is a summary of production practice. Although scientific technology has different levels of depth, the scientific principles combined with production practice are generally easy for the masses to understand.

In his speech, Zhu Kezhen particularly pointed out that Guangdong is located in a subtropical region with very rich economic resources. These resources are not only the precious wealth of our motherland, but also a valuable garden for scientific research in socialist countries. He hoped that Guangdong's scientific workers would pay attention to the development of these resources so that these natural resources could quickly serve the economic construction of the motherland and Guangdong.

Academician Dam, the famous Soviet physicist who was invited to give lectures in Guangzhou, also spoke at the meeting.

Qu Mengjue, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the meeting. From the current inspiring situation of the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in Guangdong Province, she talked about many new problems raised in production that urgently require scientists to solve, and called for a Great Leap Forward in scientific technology and philosophical social science research work. She emphasized that there are currently four ideological obstacles for scientists in Guangdong in the Great Leap Forward that need to be overcome and resolved, namely: the relationship between politics and professional work, the relationship between theory and practice, the combination of scientists with workers and peasants, and the relationship between individuals and collectives. Qu Mengjue pointed out that there are now many scientific research institutions and universities in the province, with about six thousand senior and intermediate scientific and technical workers. This is a large scientific work force, and it is necessary to organize and strengthen the leadership of this team in order to achieve a Great Leap Forward in scientific work.

Those attending the meeting included Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chen Yu, Governor of Guangdong Province, and the party and government leaders of Guangzhou, as well as representatives of scientific workers from various provinces in South China.

    地方对科学技术研究负有重大责任
    走群众路线才能多快好省
    广东讨论科学技术研究工作大跃进
    新华社广州16日电　广东省科学工作者和工农业生产技术革新积极分子近八百人，15日在刚开幕的广东科学馆内举行全省第一次科学工作会议，讨论广东科学技术研究工作的大跃进。
    广东省科学工作委员会副主任杜国庠在致开幕词时说，这次会议将着重讨论全省1958到1962年、特别是1958年科学技术研究工作规划纲要，以便着手解决当前生产中提出的迫切问题，为生产大跃进服务。
    国务院科学规划委员会秘书长范长江，中国科学院副院长竺可桢，都向大会表示祝贺并分别在会上讲了话。范长江讲话时认为，对科学技术研究工作，地方和中央都同样负有重大责任，而今后发展的趋势，地方上的任务将更重大。他认为要使科学研究工作做到多快好省，关键问题首先在于要明确科学为生产服务的目的性。他说，科学为生产服务，这不仅是目前生产大跃进的要求，从历史上看来，科学的任务都是这样。经济是社会的基础，科学是它的上层建筑，科学必须反映它和推动它前进，否则科学迟早会被它所抛弃。而当科学技术投入生产斗争中去时，科学工作就显得生动活泼，科学家也更得到群众的欢迎和爱护，同时也提高了威信。范长江在谈到科学工作作到多快好省，一定要走群众路线问题时说，科学要走群众路线，首先要破除迷信，科学是不迷信的，但是人们对科学的看法却有些迷信，把它看得有些神秘化。前几年谈到工业问题时，好像有一种说法认为只有少数专家才能去搞，但是几年来的实践证明，工业并不是那么神秘。其实科学是生产实践的总结，科学技术虽有深浅之分，但是结合生产实践的科学道理，群众一般是容易懂得的。
    竺可桢在讲话中，特别指出广东处于亚热带地区，经济资源十分丰富，这些资源不仅是我们祖国的宝贵财富，并且是社会主义国家中科学研究的宝贵园地。他希望广东科学工作者重视开发这些资源的工作，使这些自然资源迅速为祖国和广东地方的经济建设服务。
    应邀到广州讲学的著名的苏联物理学家达姆院士也在会上讲了话。
    中共广东省委书记区梦觉在会上作了报告。她从目前广东省振奋人心的工农业生产大跃进形势，谈到生产中提出许多新的问题，迫切要求科学家解决，要求科学技术和哲学社会科学研究工作来个大跃进。她强调目前广东科学家在大跃进中的四项思想障碍，需要克服解决，这就是：政治和业务的关系、理论和实际的关系、科学家和工农结合、以及个人和集体的关系。区梦觉指出，现在全省有许多科学研究机构和高等院校，高级和中级科学技术工作者约达六千人，这是很大的科学工作力量，必须组织和加强领导这个队伍，才能使科学工作大跃进。
    出席会议的有中共广东省委第一书记陶铸，广东省长陈郁和广州市的党政负责人，华南各省科学工作者的代表。
