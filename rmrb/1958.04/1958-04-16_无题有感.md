    Reflections on a Poem Without Title
    Zhong Huai
    "When will the wind of movements cease!"
    Facing wave after wave of rectification campaigns and double-anti movements, some people can't help but sigh with emotion.
    All good things must come to an end, and since a movement has a beginning, it naturally has an end.
    "When will it cease?" The answer is: it should "cease" when it's time to "cease." It turns out that movements are also objective things. When and how to launch a movement has its own laws. It's not as if anyone can launch a mass movement just because they feel like it and issue an order out of thin air. Nor will it immediately disappear just because someone doesn't like the movement.
    If you don't believe it, you might as well advocate an "anti-movement movement" and see if it can gain any momentum.
    Below "When will the wind of movements cease!" there is another sentence, which says "When will the wind of academic pursuits flourish!"
    In the eyes of the lamenters, movement and academic pursuits are incompatible, like fire and water. Where there is movement, there is no academic pursuit; if you want academic pursuits, you can't engage in movement.
    Is this really the case? At a symposium of philosophical circles in the capital, a philosopher said: Now is the most active period of Chinese people's thinking, and new things appear every day. This is an era of "producing philosophy."
    Speaking of academic pursuits in the same way, the views are very different. One can't help but ask: What kind of "wind of academic pursuits" do you want to "flourish"?

    “运动之风何时了！”
    面对着一浪高一浪的整风运动和双反运动，有人不胜感慨。
    天下无不散的筵席，一个运动既然有始，当然有终。
    “何时了”？答曰：应该“了”的时候“了”。原来运动也是客观事物，什么时候开展什么运动，怎样开展，自有它的规律。并不是什么人兴之所至，凭空下一道命令，就可以掀起一个群众运动。也不因为什么人不喜欢运动，它就马上烟消云散。
    如若不信，你不妨倡议一个“反对运动的运动”，看它运动得起来不？
    在“运动之风何时了”下面，还有一句，叫做“学术之风何时兴！”
    在感慨家看来，运动和学术是水火不相容的，有运动就没有学术，要学术就不能搞运动。
    果真这样么？首都哲学界座谈会上，一位哲学家说：现在是中国人民思想最活跃的时期，每天都有新鲜事物出现，这是“出哲学”的时代。
    同样谈到学术，看法大不相同。不免要请教一番：你要“兴”的是什么样的“学术之风”？
