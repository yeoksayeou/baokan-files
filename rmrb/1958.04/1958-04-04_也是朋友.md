	Also Friends
	Ying Lin
	Some days ago, I was talking with a comrade about the rectification campaign in their unit. He told me with deep feeling that he had been working with one of their unit's leading comrades for over a dozen years, always as the leader's assistant; but they only had a working relationship, not a friendship. During the rectification campaign in the organization, he put up a big-character poster criticizing this leading comrade, which finally attracted the leader's attention. Their relationship has become much closer than before.

	This seems like a small matter, but behind this small matter, there are things that deserve deep thought. Although I didn't ask this comrade how he treated his superior, I felt from his conversation that the main responsibility for not establishing a friendship after working together for over a dozen years lay with his superior. Because this leading comrade not only rarely took the initiative to approach his subordinates on ordinary days, but even when subordinates had something to find him about, he often did most of the talking, and the subordinates talked little, sometimes even to the point where the subordinate was talking to him, but he would leave without saying a word. Obviously, in this situation, it is very difficult for subordinates to get close to him, confide in him, and make friends with him.

	In the revolutionary ranks, due to the different divisions of labor, there are superiors and subordinates; but they are equal, all serving the people, all serving socialist construction. It is from this most basic premise that superiors and subordinates in our organizations and enterprises not only have working relationships, but also the genuine and close comradely and friendly relationships that the old society's superiors and subordinates did not have. As a superior, in addition to helping subordinates accurately complete their work tasks, they should also be very concerned about the subordinates' ideology, study, and life. Only looking at the work of subordinates, and not understanding and helping them solve other difficulties and demands, is not the relationship between superiors and subordinates in a revolutionary organization, but is somewhat like the relationship between superiors and subordinates in the old bureaucratic organizations.

	The leading cadre mentioned earlier, his loyalty to the revolution, his sense of responsibility for work, are beyond doubt; but it is also a fact that he is relatively lacking in comradely concern and democratic style in his dealings with subordinates. It is said that this leading cadre sometimes goes out by car to attend banquets, or eats at other units after meetings, and comes back after a whole day or half a day, often without caring whether the driver has a place to eat, with the result that the driver has to wait for him hungry. If such a thing only happens once or twice, it may just be a temporary oversight, but if it happens many times, it cannot but make people feel that he has this view: you are a driver, you should drive for me, as for whether you eat or not, that is your own business, I can't control it.

	People who use this kind of wrong viewpoint to treat subordinates should be said to be very individual; while those who have a relatively strong purely utilitarian viewpoint towards subordinates, rarely care about the work, life and study of subordinates, or although they also care somewhat about these aspects of subordinates, but have not achieved the level of confiding in subordinates and becoming close friends, are not individual cases. It is hoped that the raging fire of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement will burn this bureaucratic air clean, so that the relationship between superiors and subordinates will be closer, and all can become close comrades and friends.

    也是朋友
    应麟
    前些天，和一个同志谈起他们单位的整风情况。他很感慨地对我说，他和他们单位的一位领导同志在一起工作已有十几年之久，一直作这位领导同志的助手；可是他们之间只有工作上的关系，没有朋友的关系。在机关的整风中，他给这位领导同志贴了一张大字报，才引起了这位领导同志的注意。他们的关系已经比从前密切得多了。
    这似乎是一件很小的事情，然而在这样的小事情后面，却有值得人们深思的东西。我虽然没有问这位同志怎样对待他的上级，但是从他的谈话中使我感到，一起工作十几年而没有建立朋友关系，主要责任是在他的上级。因为这位领导同志，不仅平日很少主动和下级接近，就是在下级有事找他的时候，也常常是他谈的多，下级谈得少，有时甚至下级正在和他谈话，他却一言不发地走了。很显然，在这种情况下，下级要想多接近他，同他谈心，同他交朋友，是有很大困难的。
    在革命队伍里，由于分工的不同，是有着上级和下级之分的；但是他们之间是平等的，都是为人民服务，都是为社会主义建设服务。正是从这个最基本的前提出发，所以在我们的机关和企业里，上级和下级之间，不仅有工作上的关系，而且还有旧社会上下级之间所没有的真正的亲密的同志和朋友的关系。作为上级来说，除了要帮助下级准确地完成工作任务以外，还应该十分关心下级的思想学习和生活。只看下级的工作，而不了解和不帮助他们解决其它困难和要求，这就不是革命机关中的上下级关系，而是多少有些像旧的官僚机关中的上下级关系。
    前面说到的那位领导干部，对革命的忠诚，对工作的责任感，都是无可怀疑的；但他在和下级的相处上，还比较缺乏同志式的亲切关怀和民主的作风也是事实。据说，这位领导干部有时坐汽车出去赴宴会，或者会后在别的单位吃饭，一来就是一天半天，也常常不管司机有无地方吃饭，结果司机就只好饿着肚子等他。这样的事如果只有一两次，这可能只是一时的疏忽，但是次数多了，就不能不使人感到他有这样的观点：你是司机，就应该为我开车，至于吃不吃饭，那是你自己的事，我管不着。
    用这种错误的观点来对待下级的人，应该说是很个别的；而对下级有比较浓厚的单纯使用观点，平时很少关心下级的工作、生活和学习，或者虽然也多少关心下级这些方面的情况，但是没有作到和下级推心置腹、成为亲密朋友的人，那就不是个别的了。但愿反浪费反保守运动的烈火，把这股官气烧得一干二净，使上下级之间的关系更加密切，都能成为亲密的同志和朋友。
