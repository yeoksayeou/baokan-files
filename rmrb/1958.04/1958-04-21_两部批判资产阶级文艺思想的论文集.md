    Two Collections of Essays Criticizing Bourgeois Literary and Artistic Thought
    To coordinate with the current criticism of bourgeois revisionist literary and artistic thought, the New Literature and Art Publishing House is about to publish two collections of essays: "Collection of Criticisms on 'Literature is the Study of Man'" and "Collection of Essays on Socialist Realism."
    The essays collected in "'Collection of Criticisms on 'Literature is the Study of Man''" (Volume 1) systematically criticize the revisionist viewpoints spread by Qian Gurong.
    "Collection of Essays on Socialist Realism" (Volume 1) compiles more than 40 major essays on defending socialist realism and criticizing revisionist literary and artistic thought, and includes as appendices two works representative of revisionist literary and artistic thought: He Zhi's "Realism—A Broad Road" and Zhou Bo's "On Realism and Its Development in the Socialist Era."

    两部批判资产阶级文艺思想的论文集
    为配合当前对资产阶级修正主义文艺思想的批判，新文艺出版社即将出版两部论文集：“‘论文学是人学’批判集”和“社会主义现实主义论文集”。
    “‘论文学是人学’批判集”（一集）中搜集的论文对钱谷融所散播的修正主义观点进行了系统的批判。
    “社会主义现实主义论文集”（第一集）辑集了有关捍卫社会主义现实主义、批判修正主义文艺思想的主要论文四十余篇，并附录了两篇在修正主义文艺思想上有代表性的作品：何直的“现实主义——广阔的道路”和周勃的“论现实主义及其在社会主义时代的发展”。
