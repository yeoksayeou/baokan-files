Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 25th: The United States experienced another mishap on the night of April 23rd at the Cape Canaveral test site in Florida when launching a "Thor-Vanguard" missile. The radio equipment installed on the missile malfunctioned shortly after launch, failing to transmit signals, and the missile's descent became unknown.

This U.S. launch involved a two-stage missile, with the Air Force's "Thor" rocket as the first stage and the Navy's "Vanguard" rocket as the second stage. The launch initially seemed smooth. American news agencies seized the opportunity to promote it as the first U.S. test at intercontinental range, claiming it would test the problem of warhead reentry into the atmosphere, and that the test was particularly successful, watching the missile rise for five minutes. Who knew the radio went silent? People saw a pinpoint of light fall to the horizon and then disappear.

    美国洲际导弹又出丑
    “雷神”坠地不知去向
    据新华社25日讯华盛顿消息：美国于23日夜在佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角试验场发射一枚“雷神—先锋”式导弹时又出了毛病。装在导弹上的无线电设备在导弹发射不久后便不灵，发不出讯号，导弹下落就不明了。
    美国这次发射的是一个二级导弹，第一级用的是空军的“雷神”式火箭，第二级是海军的“先锋”式火箭。刚发射的时候好像还顺利。美国的通讯社乘势宣传，说这是美国第一次在洲际射程上的试验，说是要试验弹头重新进入大气层的问题，还说试验特别成功，眼看着导弹上升了五分钟。谁知无线电上去就成了哑吧。人们看到一个针尖样的亮点落到地平线后就不知去向了。
