Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd: The Soviet "Spark" magazine's sixteenth issue published an article introducing the training and flight experience of the dog Damka, who twice flew on a rocket to an altitude of 212 kilometers for biological experiments.

The article introduces that this dog's original fate was very unfortunate; it had no owner, was homeless, and roamed the streets all day long. One day, two scientific researchers discovered it and felt that its size and coat color were very suitable for high-altitude flight needs, so they took it back to raise and train it, and named it Damka.

Before formally training the dog, it is necessary to check the dog's body, feed it with special feed, so that it gets used to the name "Damka" and its new owner. Then, according to the size, a special suit with recording instruments is sewn for it, and it is put on.

Then, long-term training for high-altitude flight began. The experimenters took the dog into the laboratory, taught it to lie quietly for several hours in the container that would be launched into the sky, and made it adapt to the various external stimuli that would appear during the flight, and get used to the sound of movie cameras and various different instruments. Finally, the experimenters took it to the rocket launch site for further training.

The article said that the day for the dog's high-altitude flight finally arrived, but it still felt like an ordinary day. Damka was placed in the container at the front of the rocket. The rocket launched, and a flame shot out from its tail, instantly piercing into the sky.

The movie camera in the rocket automatically filmed Damka's activities throughout the entire flight. At the beginning, the overweight caused by the rocket's acceleration made the dog's head close to the bottom of the container, and its eyes showed a look of suspicion and fear. When the rocket flew over the Earth's atmosphere, the dog was in a state of weightlessness. At this time, it quickly raised its head, pricked up its ears to listen, and looked curiously at the round, transparent window. Finally, this dog returned to the ground from high altitude by parachute. During the return journey, its physiological condition was also good. When the experimenters opened the container, Damka jumped out with a few loud barks.

    高空旅客——达姆卡
    上天两次　情况正常
    据新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联“星火”杂志第十六期刊载了一篇文章，介绍曾两次乘坐火箭飞上二百一十二公里高空作生物试验的小狗达姆卡的训练和飞行经过。
    文章介绍说，这只小狗原来的命运很不幸，它没有主人，无家可归，终日流落街头。有一天，两个科学人员发现了它，觉得它的身材、毛色都很适合高空飞行的需要，于是将它带回去饲养和训练，并且给它取名达姆卡。
    在正式训练小狗之前，先要给小狗检查身体，用特制饲料来喂它，使它习惯于“达姆卡”的呼名和自己的新主人。然后按照尺寸给它缝制一套带有纪录仪器的特制衣服，并且给它穿上。
    接着，高空飞行的长期训练就开始了。实验人员将小狗带进实验室中，教会它在将发射上天的容器中静卧几小时，并且使它学会适应在飞行期间将会出现的各种外界刺激因素，习惯于电影摄影机和各种不同仪器的声音。最后，实验人员才将它带到火箭发射场，继续进行训练。
    文章说，小狗作高空飞行的日期终于到来了，但它仍感到这是一个平常的日子。达姆卡被安置在火箭前部的容器中。火箭发射了，它的尾部发出一股火焰，瞬时便疾钻入天空。
    火箭中的电影摄影机在整个飞行期间将达姆卡的活动情况自动地拍摄下来。开始时，由于火箭加速度而引起的超重使小狗的头贴近容器的底，它两眼表露出一种疑讶、惊惧的神色。当火箭飞越了地球大气层以后，小狗则处于失重状态。这时，它很快抬起头，耸耳倾听，好奇地望着圆圆的透明窗。最后，这只小狗用降落伞从高空回到地面，在归途中，它的生理状况也是良好的。当实验人员打开容器时，达姆卡带着几声响亮的吠叫跳了出来。
