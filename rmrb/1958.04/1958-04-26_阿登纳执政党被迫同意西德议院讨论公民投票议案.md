Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 24th: Bonn dispatch: Under the strong pressure of the broad masses of the people in West Germany, the West German Federal Parliament had to begin debating this afternoon the bill proposed by the Social Democratic parliamentary group demanding a national referendum on the issue of atomic armament in West Germany.

    The Social Democratic Party is asking the Federal Parliament to pass a law submitting the following two questions to every eligible citizen in West Germany to answer: "Do you agree to equip the German (West German) armed forces with atomic weapons?" and "Do you agree to the establishment of launching pads for rocket weapons in Germany (West Germany)?"

    The Social Democratic Party's proposal was put forward on the same day, March 25th, that the reactionary majority in the Federal Parliament passed the West German atomic armament resolution. Adenauer's ruling party repeatedly delayed the debate on this bill on various pretexts. Under pressure from public opinion, it finally reluctantly agreed to hold a debate on this bill on the 24th.

    阿登纳执政党被迫同意西德议院讨论公民投票议案
    新华社柏林24日电　波恩消息：在西德广大人民的强大压力下，西德联邦议院今天下午不得不开始就社会民主党议会党团所提出的关于要求在西德全国就原子武装问题举行公民投票的议案进行辩论。
    社会民主党要求联邦议院通过一项法案，把下面两个问题提交给西德每一个有选举权的公民来回答：“你是否同意以原子武器装备德国（西德）武装部队？”和“你是否同意在德国（西德）设置火箭武器的发射台？”
    社会民主党这个提案是在联邦议院反动多数在3月25日通过西德原子武装决议的当天提出来的。阿登纳的执政党一再借故拖延，不肯辩论这个法案。在舆论压力下，它最后才勉强同意在24日就这个法案举行辩论。
