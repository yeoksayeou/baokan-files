Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 24th: The Ministry of Commerce of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has once again written to the Ministry of Economy of the Southern Vietnam regime, suggesting the restoration of trade relations between North and South Vietnam. Minister of Commerce of Vietnam, Phan Anh, announced this letter, written on April 18th, at a press conference this afternoon.

The Ministry of Commerce of Vietnam had made similar suggestions to the Southern Vietnam authorities in 1955 and 1957, but they were rejected. At the press conference, Phan Anh pointed out that the Southern Vietnam authorities' refusal to trade with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for several years has forced Southern Vietnam to purchase expensive American coal and Japanese cement, among other goods. Meanwhile, under the impact of American capital, 60% of Southern Vietnam's textile production has come to a standstill due to a lack of sales. Southern Vietnam's rubber is also unsalable, and prices have plummeted. However, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's cheap and high-quality coal and cement cannot be transported to Southern Vietnam. He said that this extremely unreasonable phenomenon should end as soon as possible.

Phan Anh pointed out that, judging from many signs, the economic crisis in the capitalist world has affected Southern Vietnam, and recently, Southern Vietnam's public opinion has also expressed the hope that the North and South will trade with each other. Phan Anh hoped that the Southern Vietnam authorities could make a wise choice on this issue.

In the letter to the Southern Vietnam Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Commerce of Vietnam suggested discussing the restoration of trade through contacts between commercial representatives of both sides, including small-scale trade in the temporary demarcation zone area and normal relations between Haiphong and Saigon, as well as facilitating normal exchanges between industrialists and businessmen from the North and South.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 26th: Hanoi newspapers reported today that the State Bank of Vietnam wrote to the Southern Vietnam Bank on April 19th, suggesting for the fourth time that the two sides establish exchange relations, and suggested that representatives from North and South Vietnam hold a meeting to discuss arrangements for the payment of funds and exchange of goods between the two sides.

As early as February 1955, the State Bank of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam began to make this proposal to the Southern Vietnam Bank, but the Southern Vietnam side has consistently ignored this proposal, which is in the interests of the entire Vietnamese people.

### 越南商业部建议南越当局  恢复南北地区贸易关系

    越南商业部建议南越当局
    恢复南北地区贸易关系
    新华社河内24日电　越南民主共和国商业部再次写信给南越政权经济部，建议恢复越南北方和南方的贸易关系。越南商业部部长潘英今天下午在记者招待会上公布了这封在4月18日写的信。
    越南商业部曾经在1955和1957年向南越当局提出过同样的建议，但是都被拒绝。潘英在记者招待会上指出，南越当局几年来拒绝同越南民主共和国进行贸易的结果，使得南越被迫购买昂贵的美国煤和日本的水泥等货物。同时，在美国资本的打击下，南越的布匹由于没有销路而使60％的生产陷于停顿。南越的橡胶也卖不出去，价格猛跌。而越南民主共和国的价钱便宜、质量优良的煤和水泥却不能运到南越去。他说，这种极不合理的现象应该早日结束。
    潘英指出，从许多迹象看来，资本主义世界的经济危机已经波及南越，最近南越舆论界也表示希望北方和南方互通贸易。潘英希望南越当局能够在这个问题上作出明智的抉择。
    越南商业部在给南越经济部的这封信中建议通过双方的商业代表的接触来讨论恢复贸易问题，其中包括临时分界线地区的小额贸易和海防、西贡两地之间的正常关系以及给予北方和南方工商业者之间正常来往的方便等问题。
    据新华社河内26日电　河内报纸今天报道，越南民主共和国国家银行4月19日写信给南越银行，第四次建议双方建立汇兑关系，并且建议北越和南越双方的代表举行一个会议来讨论安排双方之间的款项支付和货物交换的问题。
    越南民主共和国国家银行早在1955年2月就开始向南越银行提出这项建议，但是南越方面一直漠视这个符合越南全民利益的建议。
