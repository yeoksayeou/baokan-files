Brainstorming on the Spot, Designing on the Spot, Trial Manufacturing on the Spot
Gan County Convenes a Handcraftsmen's Zhuge Liang Meeting

    Our newspaper, Ganzhou, 15th Dispatch: The Chinese Communist Party's Gan County Committee in Jiangxi Province recently convened a handcraftsmen's "Zhuge Liang Meeting," using collective wisdom to assess and improve newly created agricultural implements from various regions, and collectively create a batch of new agricultural implements.

    The more than 130 handcraftsmen participating in the meeting were master craftsmen, advanced producers, and skilled agricultural implement makers from among the county's 1,000 woodworking, ironworking, and bamboo-working artisans. They brought some new agricultural implements. The meeting adopted the method of individual introductions, collective discussions, and on-the-spot experiments to assess these implements one by one, and a total of thirty-eight were assessed. The meeting affirmed those with good results after trial use; for those that were not perfect or had shortcomings, the "Zhuge Liangs" put their heads together, offering suggestions and strategies, collectively modifying them, and jointly improving them. The Shashi Woodworking Cooperative brought a machine roller harrow that they had recently successfully trial-produced. This roller harrow was twice as efficient as the old-fashioned harrows used in the past, and was also easy to operate. However, during this assessment, people felt that it was not complete enough, so they modified it while experimenting, modifying it three times in a row, making its efficiency twice as high as the initial production.

    The meeting adopted the method of offering plans on the spot, designing on the spot, trial manufacturing on the spot, evaluating on the spot, seeing results on the spot, and promoting on the spot, quickly creating some urgently needed agricultural implements and tools, and powerfully breaking the conservative thinking in the reform of tools. Currently, the countryside urgently needs a fertilizer applicator to replace manual fertilization. At this "Zhuge Liang Meeting," the "three craftsmen" (carpenters, blacksmiths, and bamboo craftsmen) cooperated to create this tool. A carpenter from the Maodian Woodworking Cooperative proposed imitating the ash hopper used to draw white lines on ball fields to trial-produce a fertilizer applicator. Everyone agreed, jointly designed the drawings, and manufactured separately. As a result, an economical and practical fertilizer applicator was successfully manufactured. During the five-day meeting, the participants jointly manufactured thirty-seven new agricultural implements and also proposed a letter of suggestions for manufacturing ninety new agricultural implements. The meeting decided that each cooperative should mass-produce these seventy-five agricultural implements and promote their use throughout the county, and also requested that each cooperative study and trial-produce new agricultural implements based on the ninety suggestions proposed at the meeting.

    当场献计　当场设计　当场试制
    赣县召开手工业者诸葛亮会
    本报赣州15日电　中共江西省赣县县委最近召开了手工业者“诸葛亮会”，运用集体的智慧鉴定和提高各地创造的新式农具，并集体创制了一批新式农具。
    参加会议的一百三十多个手工业者，是全县一千名木器、铁器、竹器手工等工人中的老师傅、先进生产者和制造农具的能手。他们带来了一些新农具。会议采取个人介绍、集体讨论和当场试验的办法，对这些农具逐件进行鉴定，一共鉴定了三十八件。经过试用效果良好的，会议给予肯定；对于一部分不够完善和有缺点的，“诸葛亮”们在一起你一计，他一策，集体进行修改，共同改进。沙石木器社带来了一部他们最近试制成功的机器滚耙，这种滚耙比过去用的老式耙效率高一倍，操纵也方便。但在这次鉴定中，人们觉得还不够完备，就边试验、边修改，一连修改了三次，使它的效率比初制的又提高了一倍。
    会议采取当场献计、当场设计、当场试制、当场鉴定、当场见效、当场推广的办法，迅速地创造了某些当前急需的农具和工具，并且有力地打破了改革工具中的保守思想。目前农村急需一种施肥器来代替用手施肥，这次“诸葛亮会”上“三匠”（木匠、铁匠、竹匠）合作把这个工具创造出来了。茅店木器社的木匠提出仿效球场打右灰线用的灰斗来试制施肥器，大家赞同，共同设计了图样，分头制造，于是一架经济适用的施肥器便制造成功了。在五天的会议期间，参加会议的人共同制造了三十七种新式农具，还提出了制造九十件新式农具的建议书。会议确定，这七十五件农具各社要大量制造，在全县推广使用，并要求各社根据会上提出的九十件建议书研究和试制新农具。
