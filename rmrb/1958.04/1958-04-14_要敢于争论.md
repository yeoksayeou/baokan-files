    Dare to Argue
    Zhang Fan
    A Party member of a central state organ posted a big-character poster, examining his own liberalism and irresponsible attitude in discussions. He gave some examples, saying that he often had different opinions from the Party Branch Secretary on some relatively important issues, but he only put forward his personal opinions without arguing. His attitude was: I have put forward my opinion, it is up to you to adopt it or not, and the responsibility for whether things go well or badly is also yours, and has nothing to do with me. He said that other members of the Party Branch also had similar situations.
    This big-character poster raises a very noteworthy issue: to make extensive airing of views, big contending, and great debate the weapons we will regularly use in future meetings and to resolve relatively important issues, on the one hand, leaders need to be able to humbly listen to opposing opinions, be good at grasping the opposing side, and consciously organize and guide everyone to debate; on the other hand, everyone also needs to dare to clearly put forward their own opinions and dare to argue to uphold correct opinions.
    To hold meetings and solve problems is precisely because there are contradictions. The so-called solution to a problem is to unfold the contradictions, let them struggle, and unify the differences in the struggle. In this way, the problem is solved, and the work can move forward. Since the law of the development of things is like this, there is no need to be afraid to put forward one's own views, and there is no need to worry about causing controversy. A revolutionary worker, an upright laborer, does not need to conceal his views and be insincere in any situation. Whether in front of leaders or comrades of the same rank, stating one's own opinions frankly and debating with viewpoints different from one's own are originally very natural and ordinary things for our revolutionary workers. Right or wrong, there is nothing to worry about for our revolutionary workers, it will neither hurt others nor hurt ourselves.
    Some comrades may ask: The Party often teaches us to humbly listen to the opinions of others, doesn't this contradict what was said earlier about daring to stick to one's own opinions? In fact, it is not contradictory. Daring to argue is not stubbornly sticking to one's own opinions and persisting in errors; humility is also not being ambiguous and failing to distinguish between right and wrong. The two are unified, that is, what the Party often teaches us, "persist in truth and correct mistakes." A person who truly has the courage to persist in the truth must also have the courage to bow his head in the face of mistakes. When others cannot convince me, I must argue on the basis of reason, striving to convince the other party; when I cannot convince the other party and am convinced by the other party, I will unhesitatingly abandon or modify my own opinions and happily act according to the other party's opinions.
    Some comrades do not dare to boldly put forward their own opinions, and do not dare to argue, often not because they are humble, but as mentioned in the big-character poster of the comrade mentioned earlier, it is due to liberalism and insufficient sense of responsibility, feeling that whether things are done well or badly is "your" responsibility and has nothing to do with "me." It is precisely in this way that these comrades isolate themselves from the collective that should be responsible for the cause of the Party, feeling that whether things are done well or badly has "nothing to do" with them. Since they lack a high degree of responsibility, they will not have the courage to fight against things that seem wrong to them, and they will have various personal concerns about arguing.
    Of course, advocating argument should only be limited to matters of principle, ideological issues, or major issues in work. If any trivial, administrative, specific issue is also to be argued endlessly with others, it will become a vulgar and boring quarrel, which is not beneficial to anyone or anything.

### 要敢于争论

    要敢于争论
    张帆
    中央国家机关某单位的一位党组成员贴出了一张大字报，检讨自己在讨论问题中的自由主义和不负责任的态度。他举出一些例子说，对某些比较重大的问题，他和党组书记常有不同意见，但他只是把个人意见提出来，并不进行争论。他的态度是：我的意见提了，采不采纳由你们选择，事情好坏也是你们的责任，和我无关。他说，党组其他成员也有类似情况。
    这张大字报提出了一个很值得注意的问题：要使大鸣大放大争大辩成为我们今后开会和解决比较重大问题经常使用的武器，一方面需要领导者能够虚心听取反面意见，善于抓住对立面，有意识地组织和诱导大家进行争辩；一方面也需要大家敢于鲜明地提出自己的意见、敢于为坚持正确意见而进行争论。
    要开会、要解决问题，就是因为事情有了矛盾。所谓解决问题，也就是把矛盾展开，让它们进行斗争，在斗争中把分歧一致起来，这样，问题就解决了，工作就可以前进一步。事物发展的规律既然如此，就不必害怕提出自己的看法，不必顾虑因此引起争论。一个革命工作者，一个正直的劳动者，在任何情况下都不需要掩盖自己的看法而言不由衷表里不一。不论是在领导或同级同志面前，毫不掩饰地陈述自己的意见，和自己所不同意的观点进行辩论，对于我们革命工作者来说，本来都是很自然很平常的事情，对了，错了，对于我们革命工作者来说都没有什么值得顾虑的，既不会伤害别人也不会伤害自己。
    有的同志会问：党经常教导我们要虚心听取别人的意见，这和前面谈到的要敢于坚持自己的意见岂不矛盾？其实并不矛盾。敢于争论，并不是固执己见坚持错误；虚心，也不是模棱两可是非不分。二者是统一的，也就是党所经常教导我们的“坚持真理修正错误”。真正有勇气坚持真理的人，也一定有勇气在错误面前低头，当别人说服不了我的时候，我要据理力争，力求说服对方；当我说服不了对方而被对方说服的时候，就毫不迟疑地放弃或修改自己的意见，愉快地按对方的意见办事。
    有些同志不敢大胆地提出自己的意见，不敢进行争论，常常并不是因为他们虚心，而是像前面那位同志的大字报中所说的，是由于自由主义和责任心不够，觉得事情办得好坏是“你们”的责任，和“我”无关。这些同志正是这样把自己游离在应该对党的事业负责的集体之外，觉得事情办得好坏都和自己“无关”。既然缺少高度的责任心，就不会有勇气和自己看来是错误的东西进行斗争，就会对争论有各种各样的个人顾虑。
    当然，提倡争论，只应该是限于原则问题、思想问题或者工作中的重大问题。如果任何琐碎的事务性的具体问题，也都要和别人争论不休，那就会成为庸俗的无聊的争吵，于人于事都无好处。
