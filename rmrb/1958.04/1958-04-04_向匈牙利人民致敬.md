    A Salute to the Hungarian People
    Guo Moruo

    As the 13th National Day of the Hungarian People's Republic arrives, I, as a Chinese intellectual, extend fraternal congratulations to the Hungarian people with the utmost concern.

    Although Hungary and we are far apart, our hearts are connected. The achievements of the Hungarian people are our achievements. Any disturbance in Hungary makes us feel uneasy. I believe that Hungarian friends will be equally concerned about China.

    We are very fortunate that Hungary quickly stabilized after the risks of the October 1956 events. On January 7th of this year, when I passed through Budapest, I felt completely like returning to my hometown, feeling that my hometown was very stable, and I had the sweetest sleep on Margaret Island.

    I sincerely wish Hungary eternal peace and prosperity under the leadership of the Party, and that it develops by leaps and bounds.

    It is worth reassuring our Hungarian friends that our motherland, under the leadership of the Party, is currently making great leaps forward in all aspects of construction.

    We Chinese intellectuals are also working hard to carry out socialist self-transformation, accepting training from labor, striving to be single-minded and virtuous, both red and expert, and becoming working-class intellectuals in a short period of time.

    We believe that we must give our hearts to the Party and our knowledge to the people, resolutely oppose any revisionist road; we must consolidate the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, vigorously implement socialist mutual assistance, strive for lasting peace, and oppose wars of aggression.

    Our Party often teaches us that the victory of the Chinese revolution and the progress of construction could not have been achieved without the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and we must highly value the fraternal friendship of the socialist camp.

    Yes, we Chinese people, Chinese intellectuals, sincerely accept the teachings of the Party. We regard strengthening the nationwide effort under the leadership of the Party and strengthening the friendship of the fraternal camp as equally important.

    We Chinese intellectuals are working hard to strive for great leaps forward in science and technology and literature and art, following the great leaps forward in production and construction.

    Dear Hungarian friends, I know that you are very concerned about China, so on your National Day, I would like to briefly report to you on the situation in China and the situation of Chinese intellectuals. I firmly believe that you will also regard our achievements as your own.

    I wish the people of China and Hungary to work together to strive for the complete victory of socialist construction.

    向匈牙利人民致敬
    郭沫若
    匈牙利人民共和国第十三届国庆日到了，我作为中国的一个知识分子，以最大的关心，向匈牙利人民致兄弟般的祝贺。
    匈牙利和我们相隔得虽然很远，但我们的心是相联的。匈牙利人民的成就便是我们的成就。匈牙利如果有些风吹草动，便使我们感到不安。我相信：匈牙利的朋友对于中国的关心也会是同样殷切的。
    我们很庆幸：匈牙利在1956年十月事件的风险之后，很快就安定下来了。今年1月7日我曾经经过布达佩斯，就完全像回到故乡一样，觉得故乡很安稳，我在玛尔葛勒特岛上睡了一夜最甜蜜的觉。
    我衷心祝贺匈牙利在党的领导下永远安泰，一日千里地发展。
    值得向匈牙利朋友告慰的是：我们的祖国目前在党的领导下，在建设事业的各方面，正在一日千里地大跃进。
    我们中国的知识分子也正在努力进行社会主义的自我改造，从劳动中接受锻炼，争取一心一德、又红又专、在短时期内成为工人阶级的知识分子。
    我们认为必须把心交给党，把知识交给人民，坚决反对任何修正主义的道路；必须巩固以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，厉行社会主义互助，争取持久和平，反对侵略战争。
    我们的党经常教导我们：中国革命的胜利和建设的进展没有苏联和其它兄弟国家的帮助是不可能获得的，我们必须十分重视社会主义阵营的兄弟友谊。
    是的，我们中国人民，中国知识分子，对于党的教导是诚恳地接受的。我们把在党的领导下加强全民性的努力和加强兄弟阵营的友谊看作有同等的重要性。
    我们中国的知识分子正鼓足干劲，争取在科学技术和文学艺术方面也跟着生产建设大跃进而大跃进。
    亲爱的匈牙利朋友们，我知道你们是很关心中国的，所以在你们的国庆佳节，我特别把中国的情况、中国知识分子的情况，简单地向你们报告。我坚决相信：你们一定也是把我们的成就当成自己的成就一样看待的。
    祝中匈两国人民共同努力，争取社会主义建设的彻底胜利。
