    Politics is the Commander: Concrete Examples
    Hongxing Third Cooperative Values Political Work and Always Leads; Hongxing First Cooperative Neglects Political Work and Always Lags Behind
    (Our Report) The Hongxing First and Third Cooperatives of Taiping Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, are two neighboring agricultural cooperatives. The conditions in all aspects of these two cooperatives are roughly the same, but they are completely different in their approach to political and ideological work. The Hongxing Third Cooperative has always valued political and ideological work. When carrying out various tasks, it always grasps the key point that "politics is the commander, and propaganda leads the way," starting with improving the socialist consciousness of its members and explaining the tasks. The Hongxing First Cooperative, on the other hand, believes that political and ideological work is unimportant, that it doesn't matter much whether it is done or not, and only pays attention to arranging tasks in its work, often neglecting political and ideological work for its members. These two different approaches often lead to different results in the same work. In the former, the masses have high labor enthusiasm and production is in the lead; in the latter, the masses lack enthusiasm and production lags behind.
    At the beginning of the spring plowing, both cooperatives decided to adopt foreign experience for early planting by manually digging the fields to loosen the soil to solve the problem of insufficient cattle power. Because this method was being implemented for the first time, the members of both cooperatives were not used to it, and some were afraid of the cold and unwilling to go to the fields. The Hongxing Third Cooperative thought that it would not work to rely solely on administrative orders without getting through the members' thinking. Therefore, in combination with this year's production increase plan, it organized members into teams for special debates. After many debates, everyone realized that digging fields was indeed a good way to ensure early planting and achieve the production increase plan, and that being afraid of hardship was wrong. They acted one after another. At this time, more than a dozen propaganda tools in the cooperative, such as blackboards, local broadcasts, mobile bulletins, and field agitation signs, were all put into action, praising those who went to the fields first and criticizing those who were lazy and afraid of the cold. Teams and groups also launched competitions, and the results of the evaluations were published in a timely manner on the evaluation platforms set up in the cooperative and teams. In this atmosphere, those who participated in digging the fields felt very honored, and those who did not actively work felt very undignified. Under this atmosphere, the entire cooperative dug more than 400 mu of seedling fields in one go. After the Hongxing First Cooperative arranged the digging work, it only urged them to hurry up and relaxed its ideological education. Everyone's understanding was inconsistent, and they all had different opinions. The teams watched each other and made excuses to shirk their responsibilities. Several activists in the Eighth Production Team volunteered to take the lead in going to the fields, but they did not receive timely encouragement and praise from the cooperative, but were ridiculed by some conservatives and lazy people. As a result, the entire cooperative did not dig a single mu of field, and the plan failed.
    Not long ago, a few members of both the Hongxing Third and First Cooperatives had problems with food shortages. The members of these two cooperatives received an average of more than 520 jin of grain per person last year, which was enough to eat. The food shortage was mainly caused by a few wealthy peasants. The Hongxing First Cooperative, without clarifying the truth, believed that no one would cause trouble over grain after socialist education, and asked the township to increase the supply of grain. When the members saw this situation, more and more people followed suit. The Hongxing Third Cooperative first conducted investigations and studies and found that the real shortage of grain was only among a few people, and that it was mostly caused by a lack of attention to thrift. Most of those who were making trouble over grain did not lack food, but wanted to eat more refined grains. In response to this situation, the cooperative focused on solving ideological problems. They first exposed some of the wealthy peasants who were making trouble over grain, and used the method of presenting facts and reasoning to mobilize all the members to discuss, thereby raising everyone's understanding, and some of those who followed suit became sober. Then, through the method of comparative accounting, the truth about the food shortage of a few people was clarified, and the members received a vivid education in diligence and thrift. For individuals who were truly short of grain, the members provided solutions. For some members with tight rations, they specifically helped them arrange grain consumption plans so that they could eat until the harvest of the spring crops. However, the cooperative was not satisfied with this and mobilized all the propagandists to do a lot of in-depth and meticulous ideological education work afterwards.
    These two cooperatives are both close to the county seat, and some peasants often like to go to the city to drink, sit in tea houses, or wander around, which has a significant impact on production and learning. The Hongxing First Cooperative specially formulated a convention prohibiting random wandering into the city, but it could not be implemented. The Hongxing Third Cooperative, however, basically achieved it. Most of those who liked to go to the city were young people. They felt that there were no activity venues in the countryside, and they ran to the city whenever they had free time. After the cooperative vigorously carried out recreational activities, this phenomenon decreased. In the evenings or during rest times, everyone came to the club to rehearse, sing, and read newspapers, making it very lively. The cooperative often held evening parties, and sometimes even attracted members from the First Cooperative.

    政治是统帅的具体例证
    红星三社重视政治工作样样走在前面
    红星一社忽视政治工作事事落在后面
    本报讯　四川郫县太平乡红星一社和红星三社，是两个相邻的农业社。这两个社各方面的条件都大致相同，但是在对待政治思想工作上却完全两样。红星三社一向重视政治思想工作，在开展各项工作时总是抓住“政治是统帅、宣传打先锋”这一关键，从提高社员的社会主义觉悟入手，交代任务；红星一社则认为政治思想工作无关紧要，做不做没有多大关系，在工作中只注意布置任务，常常忽视对社员进行政治思想工作。这两种不同的作法，使他们在同样一项工作中往往收到不同的结果。前者，群众劳动热情高，生产走在前面，后者，群众干劲不足，生产落在后面。
    春耕开始时，这两个社提早播种，都决定采用外地经验，以人工挖田松土，解决牛力不足困难。由于这个办法是第一次推行，两社的社员都不习惯，有些人怕冷不愿下田。红星三社想到不打通社员思想，单靠行政命令是不行的，便结合今年的增产计划分队组织社员专题辩论，经过多次争辩，大家认识到挖田确是保证早栽实现增产计划的一个好办法，怕吃苦是不对的，纷纷行动起来。这时，社里的黑板报、土广播、流动快报、田间鼓动牌等十多种宣传工具一齐出动，对先下田的人表扬，对偷懒怕冷的人批评；队与队、组与组又展开竞赛，并及时把评比结果在社上和队上设立的评比台上公布。这样，参加挖田的人感到很光荣，不积极出工的很不体面，在这种空气下，全社一鼓作气把四百多亩秧田挖一遍。而红星一社布置了挖田工作后，只是一味催促，放松了思想教育，大家认识不一致，各说不一，队与队相互观望，借故推诿。第八生产队有几个积极分子自报奋勇，带头下田，但是没有受到社里及时的鼓励和表扬，反而受到一些有保守思想的人和懒汉的嘲笑。结果，全社没有挖一亩田，计划落了空。
    不久以前，红星三社和红星一社都发生少数社员闹缺粮的事情。这两个社的社员去年每人分到粮食平均在五百二十斤以上，是够吃的。闹缺粮主要是个别富裕农民捣鬼。红星一社没弄清真象，就认为经过社会主义教育后不会再有人闹粮了，就伸手向乡上要求增加粮食供应，社员们看到这种情况，跟着喊叫的人就多了。红星三社则首先进行了调查研究，发现真正缺粮的是个别的，而且多是不注意节约造成的。多数闹粮的并不是不够吃，而是想多吃细粮。针对这个情况，社里就着重解决思想问题。他们首先揭发了部分闹粮的富裕农民，用摆事实、讲道理的办法，发动全体社员讨论，从而提高了大家的认识，跟着闹的一些人清醒了。然后，又通过对比算账的方式，弄清了少数人缺粮的真象，使社员们受到一次生动的勤俭持家的教育。对于个别真正缺粮的，由社员给予解决，对一些口粮较紧的社员，具体帮助他们安排用粮计划，使其能够吃到收获小春作物。但是，该社还不以此为满足，事后又动员全社宣传员做了许多深入细致的思想教育工作。
    这两个社都靠近县城，有些农民常爱到城里喝酒、坐茶铺或者闲逛，对生产学习影响不小。红星一社特别制订公约，不准随便进城游荡，但是执行不了；红星三社却基本做到了。原来爱进城的大都是些年青人，他们感到农村没有活动场所，一有空就往城里跑。社里大力开展文娱活动后，这种现象就减少了，一到晚上或休息时间，大家都到俱乐部里来，排演、唱歌、读书报等，搞得很热闹。社里经常举办晚会，有时连一社的社员也吸引来了。
