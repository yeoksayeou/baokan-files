Earth-lime cement, manufactured using local methods, has been comprehensively promoted in Henan Province. The province's ever-expanding water conservancy projects this year can basically be self-sufficient in cement, except for a small amount of high-grade cement, by using earth-lime cement. The Ministry of Construction Engineering believes that Henan's experience has national significance. At present, farmland water conservancy projects are under intense construction, and the construction of various reservoirs and canals must be completed before the flood season arrives. All provinces should learn from Henan's experience in solving the urgent need for cement in these water conservancy projects, and find ways to promote local, low-grade cement.

The method of making earth-lime cement is very simple. Just heat the clay to 600 to 800 degrees Celsius (about the same temperature as firing bricks), then add lime and a small amount of gypsum, grind the mixture into powder, and mix it well. In Wanggou Township, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, where earth-lime cement was first trial-produced, it took only one day from the arrival of the work team to the production of cement. The more formal Dengfeng Cement Plant took only three days from preparation to production, with an investment of only 2,220 yuan, of which 1,200 yuan was spent on buying raw materials. The quality of this cement is very good. According to tests by the Henan Provincial Institute of Water Conservancy Science, the grade can reach 150 (each cubic centimeter can withstand a pressure of 150 kilograms), which is more than ten times the strength of lime. The biggest advantage of this cement is that it can harden in water, and after hardening, it has sufficient strength to resist water erosion, making it very suitable for general farmland water conservancy buildings. Moreover, the cost of this cement is only a quarter of the local selling price of ordinary cement.

The raw materials for manufacturing this cement are extremely abundant. Almost every county in western Henan has limestone, and red clay, yellow clay, black clay and other clays are found everywhere in the province. Gypsum is also produced in the northern mountainous areas. As for the firing technology and tools, they are also easy to solve. Firing lime, bricks, tiles, and basins has always been an important sideline in rural Henan, and almost every township has kilns and kiln workers. The grinding tools can be simple stone rollers, which every agricultural cooperative has several of, and small steel mills for grinding flour can also be used. Therefore, in Henan Province, the production of earth-lime cement is feasible in almost every county, district, and even township and cooperative. Whether it is centralized production or decentralized production, year-round production or seasonal production, cement can be produced in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way to meet the needs of the great leap forward in farmland water conservancy, according to local conditions and needs.

The Party committees and governments at all levels in Henan Province attach great importance to the promotion of earth-lime cement. Wu Zhipu, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally visited the pilot project in Wanggou Township and clearly stated that the promotion of earth-lime cement is the key to realizing water conservancy at present. All special districts and counties have sent people to Wanggou Township to visit and learn. At present, 82 of the 108 counties in Henan Province are producing earth-lime cement, with a daily output of 1,500 tons. The promotion work is continuing to develop to other counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives, and the province plans to produce a total of 400,000 tons of earth-lime cement this year.

### 土水泥大显神通  水利工程同洪水赛跑有了后盾

    土水泥大显神通
    水利工程同洪水赛跑有了后盾
    本报讯　用土法制造的石灰烧粘土水泥已在河南省全面推广。这个省今年一再扩大的水利工程所需要的水泥，除了少量高标号水泥外，基本上可以用石灰烧粘土水泥自给自足。建筑工程部认为河南省的这个经验有全国意义。目前各地农田水利工程正在紧张施工，各种水库水渠的建设工程都要争取在洪水到来之前竣工，各省解决这些水利工程急需的水泥问题，都应该学河南省的经验，从推行地方性的低标号水泥中去想办法。
    石灰烧粘土水泥的制法很简单，只要把粘土加热到六百度到八百度（同烧砖的温度差不多），再加石灰和少量的石膏磨粉拌匀就行了。河南省第一个试制石灰烧粘土水泥的登封县王沟乡，从工作组来到这个乡到生产出水泥，只用了一天的时间。比较正规的登封水泥厂，从筹建到生产也只用了三天时间，投资只花了二千二百二十元，其中还有一千二百元是买原料用去的。这种水泥的质量很好，据河南省水利科学研究所试验，标号可达一百五十号（每平方公方可耐压一百五十公斤），比石灰的力量超过十倍。这种水泥最大的好处是能够在水中结硬，结硬后有足够的力量抗抵水的冲刷，非常适合于一般农田水利建筑物采用。而且，这种水泥的成本只及当地普通水泥售价的四分之一。
    制造这种水泥的原料极其丰富。河南西部几乎每县都有石灰石，全省到处都有红胶泥、黄胶泥、黑胶泥等粘土，北部山区还产石膏。至于烧制技术和工具，也很好解决。烧石灰、砖瓦、盆钵，本来就是河南农村中的重要副业，几乎每乡都有窑和烧窑的工人。磨粉的工具可以采用简单的石碾，这是每个农业社都有几台的，还可以利用磨面的小钢磨。因此，在河南省生产石灰烧粘土水泥，几乎是每县、每区以至每乡、每社都能办到的。不论是集中生产或分散生产，全年生产或季节生产，都可以根据当地条件和需要，做到多快好省地生产水泥，满足农田水利大跃进的需要。
    河南省各级党委和政府对推广石灰烧粘土水泥的工作很重视。中共河南省委书记吴芝圃曾亲自到王沟乡试点视察，并且明确提出推广石灰烧粘土水泥是当前实现水利化的关键。各专区、各县都曾派人前往王沟乡参观学习。现在河南全省一百零八个县中，已有八十二个县在生产石灰烧粘土水泥，每天日产量可达一千五百吨。推广工作还在继续向其他各县和区、乡、社发展，全省计划在今年一共要生产四十万吨石灰烧粘土水泥。
