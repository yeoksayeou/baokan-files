Desperate Struggle
By People's Daily Commentator

The Indonesian government army is advancing towards the last lair of the rebel group. The rebel group is already panic-stricken. The troops coerced by the rebels have revolted one after another and turned to the government army. This has made the leading figures of the rebel group, such as Sjafruddin, rush out to beg for foreign help.

At the time when this rebel group is about to be completely crushed, news came that American-made B-25 bombers flew in from outside Indonesian territory and attacked the Mandai Air Force Base in Makassar. Although such an air raid can never save the defeat of the rebels, it is a serious situation worthy of vigilance. This air raid incident shows that the backstage boss of the rebels, seeing that the rebels are about to be destroyed, can no longer hide his anxious mood, and vainly attempts to take blatant intervention to create a more tense and complex situation, so as to intimidate the Indonesian government and people and hinder the actions of the government army.

However, this desperate struggle cannot shake the determination of the Indonesian government and people to defend their independence and oppose foreign interference. After condemning the incident as a foreign conspiracy to create chaos, Prime Minister Djuanda said that the Indonesian government would never take a step back in continuing military operations against the rebels. Prime Minister Djuanda's remarks expressed the determination of the Indonesian government and people. We, the Chinese people, angrily condemn this new crime of the United States in interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, and firmly believe that all the struggles of the rebel group and its backstage boss will be crushed by the Indonesian people.

    绝望的挣扎
    本报评论员
    印度尼西亚政府军正在向叛乱集团的最后巢穴挺进。叛乱集团内部已经惊慌失措，被叛乱分子所裹胁的军队，纷纷起义，投向政府军。这就使得叛乱集团的首要分子沙弗鲁丁之流，慌忙出来乞求外国救命。
    在这叛乱集团行将全部被粉碎的时候，消息传来：美国制造的B—25型轰炸机，竟从印度尼西亚国境之外飞来，袭击了望加锡的曼代空军基地。虽然，这样的空袭，绝不能挽回叛乱分子的败局，但是，却是一个值得警惕的严重情况。这一空袭事件，说明了叛乱分子的后台老板，眼看着叛乱分子行将覆灭，再也掩盖不住焦急的心情，妄想采取露骨的干涉，制造更加紧张和复杂的局势，来威吓印度尼西亚政府和人民，阻滞政府军的行动。
    可是，这种绝望的挣扎，是动摇不了印度尼西亚政府和人民捍卫独立、反对外国干涉的决心的。朱安达总理在谴责了这一事件是外国制造混乱的阴谋之后说：印度尼西亚政府在继续对叛乱分子采取军事行动的方面决不后退一步。朱安达总理的谈话，表达了印度尼西亚政府和人民的决心。我们中国人民愤怒地谴责美国这一新的干涉印度尼西亚内政的罪行，并且深信无论叛乱集团也好，它的后台老板也好，他们的一切挣扎，都将被印度尼西亚人民所粉碎。
