Improving Construction Tools, Reducing Physical Labor
The Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Creates More Than Sixty Types of Small Machines

    This newspaper reports that the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has utilized small machines in more than 80% of its construction work during the maintenance of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Zhengzhou-Luoyang and Luoyang-Shaanxi double-tracking of the Longhai Railway, and the reconstruction of the Baoji-Lanzhou Railway. They have created and promoted more than sixty types of various small machines based on different projects.

    In earthwork projects, there are climbing cars, circulating tipping cars, two-winged soil-dumping cars, vertical and linkage tamping machines, derricks, sliding baskets, automatic hydraulic winches, etc.; in tunnel and bridge construction, there are mobile platforms, sheet metal mobile model boards, and pneumatic drill-improved drill sharpening machines. The advantages of these tools are: cost-saving, labor-saving, simple to manufacture, and high efficiency, and workers can quickly learn how to use them.

    These small machines can not only be promoted in railway construction units, but also in other construction engineering units. Many can also be used in rural water conservancy projects and water diversion to the mountains. For example, the automatic hydraulic winch is a very good machine for diverting water to the mountains, as it can send fourteen tons of water to hundreds of meters high mountains every day.

    Top picture: The hydraulic winch can load, unload, and transport by itself, sending water to high places, and can transport more than fourteen tons per day. It can also transport rubble to high mountains. Middle picture: The vertical winch can also transport water and flagstones from low places to high places, and the efficiency is half higher than manual labor. Right picture: The wooden derrick is the simplest kind of lifting tool, with a lifting height of up to twenty meters, capable of rotating one hundred and eighty degrees, and can carry two hundred kilograms each time, with an efficiency one to one and a half times higher than manual labor.

    改进施工工具　减轻体力劳动
    铁道部第六工程局创造了六十多种小型机具
    本报讯　铁道部第六工程局在维修宝成路和陇海路郑洛、洛陕复线和改建宝兰线的工程中，已有80％以上利用小型机具施工。他们根据不同工程，创造和推行了六十多类各式各样的小型机具。
    在土方工程中，有爬坡车、循环翻板车、两翼倒土车、垂直和联动打夯机，扒杆、滑筐、自动水力绞车……等；在隧道、桥涵施工中，有活动平台、铁皮活动模型板、风钻改进的锻钎机。这些工具的好处是：省钱、省力、制作简单、工效高，工人很快就可以学会使用。
    这些小型机具不仅在铁路新建单位可以推广，在其他建筑工程单位也同样可以推广。有很多还可以在农村兴修水利和引水上山时使用。例如自动水力绞车就是引水上山的一种很好的机具，它每天可以把十四吨水送到几百公尺的高山上去。　（柏成林）
