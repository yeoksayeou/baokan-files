Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th - The piece-rate workers of the state-owned Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant recently resolutely kicked away the "stumbling block" in the Great Leap Forward – the outdated quotas, and established advanced new quotas.

This year, the employees of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant are determined to complete the task of more than doubling production with no increase or a small increase in personnel. This placed the piece-rate workers, who were taking wages according to the old quotas, in a glorious but difficult position. Glorious because they can contribute more to this year's increased production tasks; difficult because the current outdated quotas have already allowed them to receive 20% to 30% excess wages every month. If the excess is even greater, not only will the state have to spend more wages, increasing production costs, but also, unequal treatment will arise between piece-rate workers and hourly-rate workers, between workers in this factory and those in other factories.

Enlightened workers expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership's delay in revising the expired quotas. Some workers criticized the leadership, saying, "We personally set the Great Leap Forward production targets, and we cannot let outdated quotas hold us back." Yang Lingen, an old worker in the steam turbine generator workshop, criticized the leaders, saying, "You talk about the Great Leap Forward in production every day, but if the quotas are not revised, the workers will just sit and take excess bonuses. It's embarrassing to take more, and the Great Leap Forward target of producing one hundred and forty steam turbine generators will not be realized." Some piece-rate workers took the initiative to find their time records and study how much working time could be compressed, while others were already racking their brains, finding tricks, and creating new records to prepare conditions for revising the quotas.

The factory leadership decided to let the masses remove the "stumbling block" themselves and hand over the quotas to the workers for discussion. This factory has revised the quotas eight times in the past five years, and it was originally thought to be more advanced than the average electric machinery factory in Shanghai. For example, the quota for manufacturing a small generator in other factories was one hundred hours, while in this factory it was only fifty or sixty hours, but after mass discussion, the quotas were set even more advanced this time. When the old workers Wang Bofang and Wei Genbao of the steam turbine generator workshop revised the quotas, they found four measures to improve operations, compressing the quota for precision machining 750-1500 kW steam turbine generator fans from twelve hours to four hours, which is two hours less than the current actual working hours. The old worker Yang Lingen also broke operational conventions, compressing the quota from fifty-eight hours to about thirty-three hours.

In the process of the workers discussing the new quotas themselves, the workers' sense of responsibility as the leading class was further promoted, and sincere criticism and self-criticism unfolded among the workers. A new atmosphere of mutual assistance and mutual improvement appeared in production. Many old workers helped young workers make tools and helped them quickly master techniques such as high-speed cutting. Auxiliary workers on the hourly wage system carefully did the workshop site cleaning and material supply work; workshop technicians also took the initiative to help workers draw sketches for improving tools and conduct process analysis. All functional personnel in the steam turbine generator workshop made a guarantee to the workers, saying, "You are the heroes at the front line, and we strive to be good heroes in the rear, fully supporting you to break through the new quotas."

Now, more than ten workshops in the factory have revised their quotas, and it is estimated that the average quota compression for the entire factory is 24%. Currently, competitions to create new records and break through new quotas have been launched everywhere, and a mass technological innovation movement is taking shape. Shen Zhifa, a young milling worker in the steam turbine generator workshop, improved the milling cutter with the cooperation of the technician, and completed the work that originally required four and a half hours in only one and a half hours. The old worker Wang Changfa put forward eight rationalization proposals in ten days. Workers in another workshop put forward more than four hundred rationalization proposals in more than ten days. They established technological innovation research stations in the workshops and technological innovation research groups in each work section, preparing to quickly and promptly apply the rationalization proposals from the masses to production.

### 领导阶级的风格——公而忘私  上海电机厂工人主动压缩工时定额24％

    领导阶级的风格——公而忘私
    上海电机厂工人主动压缩工时定额24％
    据新华社上海16日电　国营上海电机厂计件工人最近坚决踢掉跃进中的“绊脚石”——落后的定额，订出了先进的新定额。
    上海电机厂职工今年决心在不增人或少增人的条件下完成增产一倍多的任务。这使照老定额拿工资的计件工人，处于又光荣又为难的地位。光荣的是：他们在今年的增产任务中，可以多出一分力；为难的是：现在的落后定额早已使他们月月拿到20％到30％的超额工资。如果超额更多，不仅国家要支出更多的工资，增加生产成本，并且，在计件工人和计时工人之间，这个厂的和那个厂的工人之间，也会产生待遇不合理的现象。
    觉悟的工人对领导上迟迟不修订已经到期的定额，表示不满意。有的工人批评领导说：“我们亲手订出了跃进的生产指标，不能让落后的定额来拖后腿。”汽轮发电机车间老工人杨林根批评领导人员说：“你们天天讲生产大跃进，但定额不修改，工人坐拿超额奖金，多拿了难为情，生产一百四十台汽轮发电机的跃进指标就会实现不了。”有的计件工人主动把工时记录找出来，研究能够压缩多少工时，有的已经在动脑筋、找窍门、创造新纪录，为修订定额准备条件。
    厂的领导方面决定让群众自己搬掉“绊脚石”，把定额交给工人自己讨论。这个厂五年来经过八次修订定额，原来以为比上海一般的电机厂先进，如其他厂制造一只小型发电机定额是一百小时，这个厂只有五、六十小时，但这次经过群众讨论，定额订得更先进了。汽轮发电机车间老工人汪伯芳、魏根宝修订定额时，找出四项改进操作的措施，把精车七百五十——一千五百瓩汽轮发电机风扇定额，从十二小时压缩为四小时，比目前实际做到的工时还少两小时。老工人杨林根也打破操作上的陈规，把定额从五十八小时压缩到三十三小时左右。
    在工人自己讨论新定额的过程中，进一步发扬了工人们的领导阶级责任感，工人之间展开了诚恳的批评和自我批评，在生产中出现了相互帮助、相互提高的新气象。许多老工人都帮助青年工人做工具，帮助他们迅速掌握快速切削等技术。计时工资制的辅助工人，用心做好车间场地清洁工作和材料供应工作；车间技术员也主动帮助工人画改进工具用的草图和进行工艺分析。汽轮发电机车间全体职能人员向工人提出保证说：“你们是前线英雄，我们争取做后勤好汉，全力支援你们突破新定额”。
    现在全厂十多个车间都已经修订了定额，估计全厂定额平均压缩了24％。现在，创造新纪录、突破新定额的竞赛已在各处展开，一个群众性技术革新运动正在形成。汽轮发电机车间青年铣工沈志发，在技术员配合下，改进了铣刀，只用一小时半就做完了原来需要四小时半的工作。老工人王昌发，在十天内提出了八条合理化建议。另一车间的工人在十多天之内提出了四百多条合理化建议。他们在车间里成立了技术革新研究站、各工段里成立了技术革新研究组，准备迅速及时地把来自群众的合理化建议迅速用到生产上去。
