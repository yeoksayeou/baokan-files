Xinhua News Agency, April 8th. The Polish government delegation, headed by Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz, concluded its eighteen-day visit to China and returned home by plane this morning after signing two trade agreements with the Chinese government.

Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz said happily when bidding farewell to the Chinese people that their visit to China "solved very important problems." He pointed out that the 1958 trade agreement signed between the two countries stipulates that this year's trade volume will increase by 14% compared to 1957. The long-term trade agreement signed between the two countries stipulates that the annual trade volume will increase by at least 10% each year in the future.

The Vice Chairman said: "These two important agreements, like the long-term agreements signed between Poland and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, play an important role in the economic development of the People's Republic of Poland. These agreements are built on the basis of mutual benefit, fraternal assistance, and economic cooperation, which is also the characteristic of relations between socialist countries." He said that our trade agreement "is based on a new type of relationship between the countries in our camp that has never existed before, a profound internationalist relationship that connects our two countries that are building socialism and fighting for world peace."

The Vice Chairman said that during the visit of the Polish government delegation to China, "we personally witnessed how enthusiastically the working class, peasants, and working intellectuals are united around the Chinese Communist Party and their government, fighting against conservatism and waste in the economy, and how effectively and flexibly they are organizing and arranging their forces to fight for a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production." He sincerely wished the Chinese people success in the difficult yet noble struggle to carry out socialist transformation of their great motherland.

The Vice Chairman also thanked the Chinese people for their warm hospitality, saying: "We regard your warm and fraternal attitude towards the Polish government delegation as a manifestation of the fraternal friendship that inextricably links the people of our two countries."

Vice Premier Chen Yi delivered a speech at the airport to bid farewell to the distinguished guests. He believed that through this visit of the distinguished guests, the long-standing fraternal friendship between China and Poland has been further deepened.

He said that the trade agreement signed by the two governments this time "is a new contribution to the development of Sino-Polish economic cooperation." And he firmly believed that "the Chinese people will continue to receive encouragement and assistance from the Polish people in their construction endeavors, and similarly, the Polish people can always count on the support of the Chinese people." Vice Premier Chen Yi also asked the distinguished guests to convey the sincere respect and deep friendship of the Chinese people to the fraternal Polish people.

Today, Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and Cheng Qian, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo and Zeng Yongquan, and others went to the airport to see off the distinguished guests.

Before the speeches, Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi, reviewed the guard of honor. Subsequently, the distinguished guests shook hands and bid farewell to the heads of various departments of our country's state organs, people from all walks of life, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to China.

At eight o'clock, the jet plane carrying the distinguished guests took off into the air. At this time, the people who came to see them off waved their hats and wished the distinguished guests a safe journey. (Attached picture)

    请把中国人民的友情带给波兰兄弟
    波兰政府代表团回国
    新华社8日讯　以雅罗谢维奇副主席为首的波兰政府代表团，在中国访问了十八天并同中国政府签订了两个贸易协定以后，今天早晨乘飞机离北京回国。
    雅罗谢维奇副主席在向中国人民告别的时候高兴地说，他们在中国的访问“解决了很重要的问题”。指出两国之间签订的1958年度的贸易协定，规定今年的贸易额将比1957年度增加14％。两国签订的长期贸易协定，规定今后每年的贸易额将逐年增长至少10％。
    副主席说：“这两个重要协定，像波兰和苏联以及其他社会主义国家之间签订的长期协定一样，对波兰人民共和国的经济发展起着重要的作用。这些协定是建筑在互利、兄弟般的帮助和经济合作的基础上的，这也是社会主义国家之间关系的特点。”他说，我们的贸易协定“产生的基础是以前世界上未曾有过的联系我们阵营各国之间的新型关系，是联系我们两个建设社会主义，为世界和平而斗争的国家的深刻的国际主义关系。”
    副主席说，波兰政府代表团在中国期间，“亲眼看到工人阶级、农民、劳动知识分子是多么热情地团结在中国共产党的周围，团结在自己政府的周围为反对经济中的保守主义和浪费现象而斗争着、也看到他们如何有效地并灵活地组织着，安排着自己的力量，为工农业生产中的大跃进而斗争着。”他衷心地祝中国人民在对自己伟大的祖国进行社会主义改造的困难的然而却是崇高的斗争中能够取得胜利。
    副主席还感谢中国人民的殷勤招待，他说：“我们把你们对待波兰政府代表团的热情的、兄弟般的态度看作是牢不可破地连结着我们两国人民的兄弟般的友谊的表现。”
    陈毅副总理在机场上致词欢送贵宾。他认为，通过贵宾们这次访问，中波两国之间久已存在的兄弟般的友谊有了进一步的加深。
    他说，两国政府这次签订的贸易协定，“是对于发展中波经济合作关系的新的贡献”。并且深信，“中国人民在自己的建设事业中一定会继续得到波兰人民的鼓舞和帮助，同样的，波兰人民也永远可以指望着中国人民的支援。”陈毅副总理还请贵宾们把中国人民的诚挚敬意和深厚的友情带给兄弟的波兰人民。
    今天，国务院副总理贺龙，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长郭沫若、程潜，人民政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中，外交部副部长罗贵波、曾涌泉等都到机场欢送贵宾。
    在讲话以前，雅罗谢维奇副主席由陈毅副总理陪同检阅了仪仗队。随后，贵宾们同我国国家机关各部门负责人、社会各界人士和各国驻华使节握手道别。
    八时，贵宾们乘坐的喷气式飞机凌空而起。这时，欢送的人们挥着帽子祝贵宾们一路平安。（附图片）
