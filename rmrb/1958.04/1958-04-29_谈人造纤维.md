    Talking about Man-Made Fibers
    Gao Shiqi
    Amidst the surge of vigorously developing local industries, the successful trial production of man-made cotton from wild plants and rice straw by manual methods in the Zunyi Special District of Guizhou Province, as well as in Sichuan and Shaanxi, is truly inspiring news (see People's Daily, March 16th). This man-made cotton has low cost, good quality, simple production methods, and can be produced in large quantities.

    Man-made cotton is a type of man-made fiber.

    To understand the truth about man-made fibers, we must first understand what fibers are.

    Fibers are the raw materials used for textiles. In nature, there are only two types of fibers that can be used for textiles: one is plant fiber – cotton, flax, ramie, etc.; and the other is animal fiber – silk and wool.

    The origin of fiber is cellulose, the protector of cells. Generally speaking, animal cells do not contain cellulose, only plant cells do. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose, which means that plants are full of cellulose, accounting for half of their body weight.

    Chemists have broken down cellulose again and again and discovered that it is made up of thousands of carbon atoms linked together. Of course, its molecules also contain other atoms such as hydrogen and oxygen. Its length is a thousand times greater than its diameter, so it appears thin and long under a microscope.

    Paper, fine cotton wadding, thread, and cloth, which we are familiar with, are all made of cellulose. Fine cotton wadding, cloth, and thread are mainly made of cotton fiber, which contains 99% cellulose; paper is mainly made of wood fiber, which contains 40% cellulose.

    Cellulose has a characteristic that it is very stable to the action of all chemical solutions. That is to say, it is difficult for any chemical solution to dissolve it. We use this characteristic to separate it from various plant materials.

    If we put wood chips in a covered pot, add alkaline water, and boil it with the pressure in the pot maintained at four to five atmospheres for twenty to twenty-five hours, the hard wood will become soft. All the other substances it contains will dissolve in the alkaline water, leaving behind cellulose.

    However, the cellulose separated in this way is too short to be used for spinning. Even if it is spun into thread, it will not be strong. It loses its toughness as soon as it gets wet. This is because the fibers used for making paper are held tightly together by surface cohesion.

    To make strong thread, we should use another method to tighten these cellulose molecules together. What method should we use? We must dissolve them, separate them one by one, and then rearrange them in a proper way.

    As mentioned earlier, cellulose is difficult to dissolve. Currently, there is only one solvent that can be used industrially to dissolve cellulose, which is cuprammonium solution. When this solution is diluted with water, cellulose is easily separated out. People use this method to make rayon, which is called the cuprammonium method. There are also other methods for making rayon, such as the nitrate method, viscose method, and acetate method.

    When the first rayon factory started production, it used the nitrate method to manufacture it. This method involves treating cellulose with nitric acid to turn it into nitrocellulose, and then pressing the nitrocellulose dissolved in alcohol or ether through small holes with a diameter of 0.1 mm to create rayon. However, this type of nitrated rayon, like the raw material used for making gunpowder, is nitrocellulose, which can explode when heated, making it unsuitable for making clothing.

    Currently, the most common type of rayon is made using the viscose method. This method was created based on the theory of the great Russian chemist Mendeleev. Mendeleev said: If we treat cellulose with a solution of caustic soda, it will become alkalized cellulose. If we then treat it with carbon disulfide, it will become a new compound called cellulose xanthate. This new compound can dissolve in dilute alkaline solution and become a viscous substance. When this viscous substance is put on a spinning machine, it will immediately spin out continuous silk threads.

    Rayon manufactured using other methods has also been developed to a considerable extent, but only the viscose method is the most economical. Moreover, this method can also be used to manufacture many new products, such as artificial hair, artificial straw, sausage casings, cellophane, and packaging materials.

    Rayon made using the acetate method is called acetate rayon. Acetate rayon is made from cotton cellulose, which is treated with acetic acid to become cellulose acetate. Many chemical solvents, such as acetone, can dissolve cellulose acetate to make acetate rayon. Although this method is simple, it requires twice as many chemical raw materials as the viscose method and is also very expensive, so the production of acetate rayon lags behind viscose rayon, ranking second.

    Rayon manufactured using the cuprammonium method is called cuprammonium rayon. Its chemical raw materials are very expensive, and its production cannot keep up with acetate rayon. However, its silk is very fine, unmatched by other rayon and natural silk, almost as fine as the silk spun by spiders. People use it to make socks that are very thin and transparent.

    The purpose of man-made fiber industrial production is to transform the protector of plant cells into the protector of human bodies. Now, the people of Zunyi and other places in Guizhou Province have successfully trial-produced man-made cotton from rice straw, bark, and wild plants using the simplest chemical methods, spending little money, achieving quick results, and producing high yields, which is feasible everywhere. This is truly a new creation that meets the actual needs of the Chinese people!

    谈人造纤维
    高士其
    在大力发展地方工业的浪潮中，贵州省遵义专区以及四川、陕西等地利用手工从野生植物和稻草中试制人造棉成功了（见3月16日人民日报）。这种人造棉成本又低，质量又好，生产方法又简单，而且可以大量生产。这真是一个振奋人心的好消息。
    人造棉是人造纤维的一种。
    要了解人造纤维的真相，先要懂得纤维是什么。
    纤维是纺织用的原料。在自然界里，只有两种纤维可以供纺织用，一种就是植物纤维——棉花、亚麻、苎麻等；另一种就是动物纤维——丝和毛。
    纤维的出身是纤维素，纤维素是细胞的保护者。一般说来，动物的细胞是没有纤维素的，只有植物的细胞才有。植物的细胞壁就是由纤维素组成，可见植物满身都是纤维素，它占植物身体重量的一半。
    纤维素这种东西，化学家把它分解了而又分解，才知道它是由数以千计的碳原子联结而成的。当然在它的分子里也包含着别种原子如氢、氧等。它的长度比它的直径大一千倍，所以在显微镜下它显得又细又长。
    纸张、细棉絮、线和布这些我们所熟悉的东西，都是由纤维素所构成，细棉絮、布和线主要是棉花纤维所制成，它含有99％的纤维素；纸张主要是由木质纤维所制成，它含有40％的纤维素。
    纤维素有一种特性，就是它对于一切化学溶液的作用都是很稳定的。这就是说：任何化学溶液都很难把它溶解。我们就是利用它的这种特性，把它从各种植物原料中分离出来。
    如果我们把木质碎屑放在带盖的大锅里，加上碱水一道煮，锅里的压力保持在四至五个大气压，煮沸二十到二十五个小时之后，硬梆梆的木质就变成软绵绵的东西了。它所含有的其他各种物质都溶化在碱水里去，最后留下来的就是纤维素。
    不过这样分离出来的纤维素因为太短，只能用来造纸，不能用来纺线。就是纺成线也是很不结实的。只要一沾水一点韧性都没有了。这是因为这种造纸的纤维是靠着表面的聚力而结紧在一起的。
    要想造成结实的线，就应当用别种方法把这些纤维素分子结紧在一起。用什么方法呢？就是要把它们溶解，使它们一个个分开，然后再重新排列起来，而且要排列得很适当。
    前面已经说过：纤维素是很难溶解的东西，目前，只有一种溶剂，在工业上使用可以溶解纤维素，那就是氢氧化铜的氨溶液。这种溶液当用水来稀释的时候，纤维素就很容易被分离出来。人们用这种方法来制造人造丝，这就叫做铜氨法。还有其他各种制造人造丝的方法如硝酸法，粘液法，醋酸法。
    在第一个人造丝的工厂开始生产的时候，是用硝酸法来制造的。这种方法就是：把纤维素经过硝酸处理，变成了硝化纤维素，然后把溶解在酒精或乙醚中的硝化纤维素，通过0.1毫米直径的小孔压成了人造丝。但是，这种硝化人造丝和制火药所用的原料一样，都是硝化纤维，一受热就引起爆炸，因而不适合于制造衣料用。
    目前，最普通的一种人造丝，就是用粘液法来制造的。这种方法是根据俄国伟大化学家门捷列夫的理论而创造出来的。门捷列夫说：如果我们用苛性钠的溶液处理纤维素，它就变成碱化纤维素。再用二硫化碳处理，就变成一种新的化合物，叫做纤维素的黄原酸盐。这种新的化合物，能够溶解在稀碱液中，而变成粘液性的东西。这种粘液性的东西拿到纺丝机上，立刻就会纺出连续不断的丝线来。
    用其他各种方法制造的人造丝，也得到相当的发展，但只有粘液法才是最经济的方法。而且用这种方法还可以制造许多新的制品，例如人造发、人造麦秆、盛香肠的肠衣、玻璃纸、包装用具等。
    用醋酸法制造成的人造丝，叫做醋酸丝。醋酸丝是由棉花纤维素制成的，它经过醋酸处理，变成醋酸纤维素。有许多化学溶剂如丙酮等都可以把醋酸纤维素溶解而制成醋酸丝。这个方法虽然简便，但它所需要的化学原料比粘液法多一倍而且价格还很贵，所以醋酸丝的生产落在粘液丝的后面，占第二位。
    用酮氨法制造的人造丝，叫做酮氨丝。它的化学原料是非常昂贵的，它的生产还赶不上醋酸丝。但它的丝非常细，为其他人造丝和天然丝所不及，几乎像蜘蛛吐出的丝那末细，人们用它来制造的袜子非常薄而透明。
    人造纤维工业生产的目的，是要把植物细胞的保护者改造成为人体的保护者。现在，我国贵州省遵义等地的人民，从稻草、树皮和野生植物中用最简便的化学方法试制人造棉成功，花钱少，见效快，产量很高，到处可行。这真是切合中国人民实际需要的一种新创造啊！
