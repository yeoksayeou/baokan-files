    Review and Spur On
   By our reporters Ji Qun and Zhou Li

    A comprehensive exhibition reflecting and promoting the great leap forward in production—the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Production Competition Exhibition for Advanced, More, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results opened on April 1st at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building. The exhibition displayed more than four thousand kinds and over ten thousand pieces of exhibits, and more than one thousand four hundred charts. Through these exhibits, people can feel that Shanghai's industry is leaping forward at an astonishing pace.

    The industrial hall, filled with the rumbling of machinery, is where the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Production Advanced Experience Exhibition exhibited China's first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator two years ago. Today, a 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator of the same shape but larger volume has appeared here. A chart on the wall next to the steam turbine indicates that a 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator will be manufactured by next year. Behind the steam turbine generator, the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory exhibited three brand-new precision grinders. A self-designed surface grinder was compared with the famous Swedish "Malcus" factory's surface grinder at the Leipzig International Fair in Germany, and it outperformed the Swedish grinder in cutting performance. Another one is the gear grinder that was recently manufactured. Grinding gears with it, the error around a circle is only one thirty-sixth of a strand of hair. Currently, only the Soviet Union, the United States, and Switzerland can manufacture this type of machine tool internationally. The product quality of many small factories in Shanghai that were previously unknown has also reached advanced levels. Active dyes, invented in the UK two years ago, have been successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Runhua Dye Factory. Another small factory—the Tongren Alloy Factory—manufactures manganese copper wire resistors with performance better than those made in West Germany. So far, Shanghai has more than 100 products that have caught up with the quality levels of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other capitalist countries.

    The exhibition uses real objects and numerical comparisons to launch vivid and powerful criticism and self-criticism. There are two generators at the exhibition that are similar in shape and close in materials, but the one made by the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory only has a generating capacity of 16.5 kilowatts, while the one made by the Qian Yongji Electric Motor Factory has 30 kilowatts. The costs of some clock factories in Shanghai are more than 20% higher than those of advanced factories. A chart at the exhibition states: if all clock factories can catch up with the cost level of advanced factories, then this industry can save 1.1 million yuan a year, and this money can be used to produce 200,000 alarm clocks.

    The exhibition also specifically mentioned that many famous products in Shanghai have been replaced by products from other factories because the factories that produce them are complacent, conservative, and stick to their old ways. Among them, the nationally famous Shield brand ping-pong balls and the well-known Green Leaf brand shirts have fallen behind in this evaluation, with Green Leaf shirts ranking as low as eighth. Shanghai's enamel industry, which has nearly 40 years of history, submitted products for evaluation at this exhibition, but they were not as good as those from the Xi'an Enamel Factory, which only has six years of history. These facts tell people that these factories can only catch up by eliminating the mentality of being old and famous brands. The exhibition also introduced some examples of humbly learning from advanced experiences. For example, the lemon yellow pigment produced by the Shanghai Chrome Yellow Factory used to be very famous in China, but later Tianjin surpassed them. They immediately sent people to Tianjin to learn, and they also continuously improved their operations and formulas. Now, in terms of gloss and fastness, they have not only surpassed Tianjin but also caught up with the British "Buchenon."

    检阅和鞭策
   本报记者　季群　周立
    一个全面反映生产大跃进和促进生产大跃进的展览会——上海市工业生产比先进、比多快好省展览会，4月1日在中苏友好大厦开幕了。展览会展出了四千多种、一万多件展品和一千四百多幅图表。透过这些展品，人们可以感到上海的工业正以一日千里之势向前飞跃。
    充满着隆隆机声的工业大厅，就是两年前上海市工业生产先进经验展览会展出我国第一台六千瓩汽轮发电机的地方。今天这里出现了形状相同而体积更大的一万二千瓩的汽轮发电机。在汽轮机旁边的墙上有一幅图表表明，到明年就要制造五万瓩的汽轮发电机了。在汽轮发电机的后面，上海机床厂展出了三台崭新的精密磨床。一种自行设计的平面磨床，曾在德国来比锡的国际博览会上和瑞典有名的“马尔考斯”厂的平面磨床作过比较，在切削性能上胜过了瑞典的磨床。另一台是最近才制成的齿轮磨床，用它磨制齿轮，一周围的误差只有一根头发丝的三十六分之一。这种机床现在国际上只有苏联、美国、瑞士三个国家能够制造。上海许多名不见经传的小厂的产品质量，也达到了先进的水平。两年前英国发明的活性染料，上海润华染料厂已经试制成功了。另一家小厂——铜仁合金厂，制造的锰铜丝电阻的性能，比西德货还要好。到目前为止，上海已有一百多种产品赶上了英美和其他资本主义国家的质量水平。
    展览会用实物和数字对比的办法，展开了生动有力的批评与自我批评。展览会上有这样两只发电机，形状相似，用料接近，但是，上海电机厂做的一只发电能力只有十六点五瓩，而钱镛记电机厂做的一只却有三十瓩。上海有些钟厂成本要比先进厂高出20％以上。展览会上有一幅图表上写着：如果各钟厂都能赶上先进厂的成本水平，那末这个行业一年就可以节约一百一十万元，这些钱又可以用来生产二十万只闹钟。
    展览会上还特别提到上海的许多有名的产品，由于生产它们的工厂自满保守，故步自封，它们的地位已被别的工厂的产品取而代之了。其中如全国闻名的盾牌乒乓球、国内外有名的绿叶牌衬衫，在这次评比中都落后了，绿叶衬衫竟退居第八位。上海有近四十年历史的搪瓷工业，这次拿到展览会上来评比的产品，却不及只有六年历史的西安搪瓷厂。这些事实告诉了人们，这些厂只有打掉老大、名牌思想，才能赶上去。在展览会上也介绍了一些虚心学习先进的范例。例如上海铬黄厂过去生产的柠檬黄颜料，国内很有名，后来天津赶过了他们，他们立即派人去天津学习，回来也不断改进操作和配方，现在在光泽度、牢度等方面不仅超过了天津，还赶上了英国的“卜内门”。
