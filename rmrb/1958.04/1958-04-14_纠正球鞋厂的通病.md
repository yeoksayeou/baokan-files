    Correcting the Common Problems of Shoe Factories
    After reading the report "Which Factory's Sneakers are More Durable?" published in the "Compare" column of the People's Daily on April 4th, it reminded me of a pair of sneakers that have been stored in my box for a long time. They are a product of the Beijing Rubber Factory No. 1. I only wore them intermittently for half a year after buying them, but they have been resting quietly for almost a year. It's not that I don't like wearing sneakers, nor that I dislike their style and color, but that their "internal troubles" are serious and their "heart is dirty": the exposed sponge often dyes the soles of my socks black, and it's difficult to wash off. It is said that this is a common problem in shoe factories. I suggest that relevant units study and improve it.　Yang Xizheng

    纠正球鞋厂的通病
    看了4月4日人民日报比一比栏内刊登的“哪个厂生产的球鞋耐穿？”的报道后，使我想起了久藏在箱内的那双球鞋。它是北京橡胶一厂的产品。买来后我只断断续续的穿了半年，而它却静静地休息了将近一年。不是我不爱穿球鞋，也不是嫌它的式样与颜色不美观，而是它的“内患”严重、“心底脏”：露出来的海绵常把袜底染黑，而且很难洗，据说这是球鞋厂的通病，建议有关单位研究改进。　杨希正
