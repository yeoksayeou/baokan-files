    Semiconductor Generator
    The Beijing Public-Private Joint Venture Chaoyang Motor Factory has successfully trial-produced a semiconductor generator. It is very small and, when installed on a specially made or modified large kerosene lamp, can use the heat emitted by the wick to generate two watts of electricity, enough to power a five-tube radio. This semiconductor generator was researched and trial-produced jointly by Zhou Yunfeng, the factory's chief engineer, engineer Yang Baolu, and workers Yang Xuewen and Yu Zhifan. They overcame difficulties such as a lack of data and incomplete materials, and after forty days of painstaking research, they finally succeeded. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    半导体发电器
    北京公私合营朝阳电机厂试制成功一种半导体发电器。它的体积很小，安装在专制的或改装的大型煤油灯上，利用灯芯放出的热，可以发出供一架五灯收音机用的两瓦特电量。这种半导体发电器，是这个厂总工程师周云峰、工程师杨宝禄和工人杨学文、于治藩共同研究试制的。他们克服了资料缺少、材料不全等困难，苦心钻研了四十天终于成功。　（据新华社讯）
