Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 3rd. Three on-site training classes for artificial petroleum technicians, organized by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Industry in Luquan and other counties, commenced on the 1st and 2nd of this month. This is one of the main measures taken by Yunnan Province to massively develop the artificial petroleum industry in various counties.

The more than one hundred participants in this training class come from more than forty counties, including Rongfeng, which are rich in raw materials for artificial petroleum. Based on the different mineral deposit situations in each county, some are studying low-temperature carbonization technology for extracting crude oil from lignite in the Yiliang County coal mine; some are studying the method of extracting crude oil from oil shale using bulk dry distillation, and extracting gasoline, diesel, and white oil from crude oil using simple fractionation in the Luquan County Power Refinery; and some are studying the method of extracting crude oil and gasoline from bituminous coal in the Fuyuan County Qianjin Coking Plant. Their study period is half a month. After completing their studies and returning to their counties, they will begin manufacturing small refinery machinery themselves.

Yunnan Province has 105 counties with reserves of lignite and bituminous coal from which petroleum can be extracted. The lignite in Xiaolongtan, Kaiyuan County, has reserves of over 800 million tons and an oil content of about 5%. The oil shale in Luquan County has an oil content of over 20%.

    发展县营石油厂的先锋
    云南已经动手训练技术人员
    据新华社昆明3日电　云南省工业厅在禄劝等县开办的三个人造石油技术人员现场训练班，已在1日、2日先后开学。这是云南省各县大量发展人造石油工业的主要措施之一。
    参加这期训练班学习的一百多人，来自盛产人造石油原料的榕峰等四十多个县。根据各县不同的矿藏情况，他们有的在宜良县煤矿学习从褐煤中提炼原油的低温干馏技术；有的在禄劝县动力炼油厂学习用成堆干馏法从油母页岩中提取原油，用简单分馏法从原油中提取汽油、柴油和白油；有的在富源县前进炼焦厂学习从烟煤中提取原油和汽油的办法。他们的学习时间是半个月。学成回县以后，就由各县动手自制小型炼油厂的机器。
    云南省有一百零五个县蕴藏着可以从中提取石油的褐煤和烟煤。开远县小龙潭的褐煤，储量在八亿吨以上，含油率在5％左右。禄劝县的油母页岩的含油率在20％以上。
