Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 22nd: Saigon News: South Vietnamese newspapers have recently frequently discussed the US economic crisis, and many newspapers have publicly expressed serious anxiety about the malignant impact of this crisis on the South Vietnamese economy.

    The "Freedom Daily" recently stated in an article that the backlog of nearly one million cars in the United States has greatly affected the sales and prices of South Vietnam's main export, rubber. It also listed the impact of the US economic crisis on some countries in Western Europe, Japan, and Southeast Asia. The newspaper said that what is also causing anxiety in South Vietnam and other countries is that production in the United States, France, and other countries is declining, but prices continue to rise. It said that South Vietnam exports less and imports more, with low export prices and high import prices, which further exacerbates the trade deficit.

    The "New Saigon Daily" said that due to "external influences," South Vietnam's economy has entered a serious situation. After listing a list of factories and companies that have recently closed or are about to close, the newspaper said that "two-thirds of South Vietnam's small industries and three-quarters of its industries have ceased operations." It said: "This number will increase in another month."

    The "Opinion Daily" reported that after the South Vietnamese authorities recently announced an agreement it signed with the United States to import US surplus cars, the price of cars in South Vietnam immediately fell by one-half to two-thirds.

    跟着美国一起倒霉
    南越工业四分之三瘫痪
    新华社河内22日电　西贡消息：南越报纸最近经常谈到美国经济危机问题，许多报纸还对南越经济会受这种危机的恶性影响公开表示严重焦虑。
    “自由报”最近在一篇文章里说，美国近百万辆汽车的积压使南越的主要出口货橡胶的销路和价格大受影响。它还列举了美国经济危机对西欧、日本和东南亚一些国家产生影响的情况。报纸说，还使南越和其它一些国家焦虑的是，美、法等国的生产在下降，但物价却继续在上涨。它说，南越出口少入口多，出口货价低而入口货价高，这样一来对外贸易的逆差就更大了。
    “新西贡报”说，由于“外来的影响”，南越的经济已进入严重局面。这家报纸列举了一批新近倒闭和即将倒闭的工厂和公司的名单后说，南越“小工业的三分之二和工业的四分之三已经停业”。它说：“这个数字再过一个月后还会增加”。
      “言论报”报道，南越当局最近公布了它同美国签订的一项输入美国积压的汽车的协定的消息之后，南越的汽车价钱立刻下跌二分之一到三分之二。
