Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 10th: Two resolutions by the Mongolian Council of Ministers regarding the adoption of crop rotation methods and the development of seed crop production were published here today. These resolutions indicate that Mongolia will further develop agricultural production.

The resolution on adopting crop rotation methods pointed out that the current practice in Mongolia of allowing cultivated land to lie fallow after being cultivated for a period of time does not rationally utilize the land and hinders agricultural development. Adopting crop rotation methods is very beneficial for improving soil, increasing yields per unit area, and developing agricultural production. The resolution tasked the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry to gradually implement crop rotation methods in all state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms from this year to 1960, and to formulate crop rotation areas for grain crops and feed crops based on the geographical, climatic, and economic conditions of each farm, combined with development prospects. The resolution also required agricultural and pastoral cooperatives to adopt crop rotation methods in conjunction with completing the tasks assigned by the state.

The resolution on developing seed crop production stated that Mongolia's seed crop production lags behind the requirements of agricultural development, affecting the development of agricultural production. Therefore, it was decided that the land sown with wheat for seed use by state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms should account for 16% to 18% of the wheat cultivated area, oats should account for 18% to 20%, and four state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms should be converted into seed farms to produce various crop seeds suitable for Mongolia's natural conditions. Seed test plots will be established starting in 1959, and by 1961, the needs of state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms will be met with high-quality seeds.

    蒙古进一步发展农业生产
    采用耕地轮种制合理使用土地
    新华社乌兰巴托10日电　这里今天发表了蒙古部长会议关于采用耕地轮种方法和发展种籽作物生产的两项决议。这些决议表明蒙古将进一步发展农业生产。
    关于采用耕地轮种方法的决议指出，目前在蒙古实行的让耕地耕种一个时期即行休闲的办法不能合理地使用耕地，并且妨碍农业的发展。采用耕地轮种方法对改良土壤、提高单位面积产量和发展农业生产有很大好处。决议责成农牧业部从今年起到1960年，逐步使所有的国营农牧场都采用轮种方法，并且根据各农牧场所在地区的地理、气候和经济状况，结合发展远景制定粮食作物和饲料作物的轮种地区。决议还要求农牧业合作社结合完成国家交给的任务也采用轮种方法。
    发展种籽作物生产的决议说，蒙古种籽作物的生产落后于农业发展的要求，影响了农业生产的发展。因此决定各国营农牧场播种作为种籽用的小麦地应占麦类耕地的16％到18％，燕麦占18％到20％，并且把四个国营农牧场改为种籽农场，生产适合蒙古自然条件的各种作物种籽。从1959年开始设立种籽试验田，到1961年开始以优良种籽供应国营农牧场的需要。
