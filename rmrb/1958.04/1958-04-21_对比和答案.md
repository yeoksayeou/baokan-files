Comparison and Answer
Shi Yitiao

To illustrate the importance of political and ideological work, we have a very vivid saying: "Politics is the commander." This means that no matter what work we do, if we put politics in the commanding position, then this work will definitely achieve great success. Conversely, even if there are many people and a strong force, they will often become a rabble and it will be difficult to achieve the deserved victory.

However, some people who value professional work and belittle politics are never quite convinced of this principle. In their view, political and ideological work is just a matter of talking and reasoning. It cannot replace human labor, nor can it directly increase production, and it is of no help to practical work. Therefore, they not only ignore political and ideological work themselves, but also feel that it is a waste of time for others to spend time on it.

Of course, labor and production must be done by hand, and cannot be simply replaced by political and ideological work. There is no doubt about this. However, in labor and production, political and ideological work also occupies its due position. Here, the news from the Red Star No. 1 Cooperative and the Red Star No. 3 Cooperative in Taiping Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, provides us with a vivid fact. This fact, from the positive and negative sides, once again proves the truth that politics is the commander, and once again refutes the erroneous understanding of neglecting political and ideological work.

Red Star No. 1 Cooperative and Red Star No. 3 Cooperative are two closely adjacent cooperatives, and their conditions are "roughly the same in all aspects." When mobilizing the masses to dig fields, both cooperatives faced the same difficulties, such as the masses being afraid of the cold and not being accustomed to it. Red Star No. 3 Cooperative grasped the key that "politics is the commander and propaganda takes the lead," truly solved the ideological problems of the masses, inspired their enthusiasm for labor, and successfully completed the production plan. Red Star No. 1 Cooperative believed that "political and ideological work is unimportant, and it doesn't matter whether it is done or not." Therefore, although they made "arrangements" and "urged" the digging work, and a few activists took the lead in going down to the fields, the masses' ideology was not clear, and the entire digging plan failed. What does this obvious contrast illustrate? It is worth thinking about for those who neglect political and ideological work.

Similarly, when a few commune members clamored about "lack of food," the two cooperatives faced the same situation. At this time, the method of Red Star No. 1 Cooperative was to reach out to higher authorities to request an increase in the supply of grain. The method of Red Star No. 3 Cooperative was to conduct investigation and research and mobilize the masses to conduct discussions. As a result, more and more people in Red Star No. 1 Cooperative shouted "lack of food," while the problem in Red Star No. 3 Cooperative was solved very well, and the commune members also received an education in diligence and thrift. What does this fact also illustrate? It is also worth thinking about for those who neglect political and ideological work.

The experience of Red Star No. 3 Cooperative can be summarized in one point: political and ideological work truly played the role of "commander." Does political and ideological work really help practical work? Here is a good answer.

    为了说明政治思想工作的重要，我们有个很形象的说法，叫做“政治是统帅”。这就是说，不论做什么工作，如果使政治居于统帅的地位，那么，这项工作一定可以取得巨大的成就。反之，即使人多势众，也往往会成为一群散兵游勇，很难获得应有的胜利。
    可是，有些轻政治、重业务的人，总是不十分信服这个道理。在他们看来，政治思想工作只不过是动动口舌，讲点道理而已，既不能代替人的劳动，也不能直接增加生产，对实际工作并没有什么帮助。因此，他们不但自己忽视政治思想工作，而且还觉得别的人把时间花在这上面，似乎是无谓的浪费。
    诚然，劳动和生产必须动手，决不能单纯的用政治思想工作来代替，这是毫无疑义的。不过，在劳动和生产中，政治思想工作同样占据着它应有的地位。这里，四川郫县太平乡红星一社和红星三社的新闻给我们提供了一个生动的事实。这个事实，从正面，从反面，再一次地证明政治是统帅的真理，再一次地批驳了忽视政治思想工作的错误认识。
    红星一社和红星三社是紧紧相邻的两个社，它们的条件“各方面都大致相同”。在发动群众挖田的时候，两个社同样面对着群众怕冷、不习惯等等困难。红星三社抓住了“政治是统帅、宣传打先锋”的关键，真正解决了群众的思想问题，鼓舞了群众的劳动热情，胜利的完成了生产计划。红星一社认为“政治思想工作无关紧要，做不做没有多大关系”，因此，尽管他们对挖田工作做了“布置”、“催促”、并有少数积极分子带头下田，可是群众思想不通，挖田计划全部落空。这个显明的对比，说明了什么呢？很值得一些忽视政治思想工作的人想一想。
    同样，当着有少数社员叫嚷“缺粮”的时候，两个社又面临着同样的处境。这时，红星一社的办法是：伸手向上级要求增加粮食的供应；红星三社的办法是：进行调查研究，发动群众进行讨论。结果，红星一社叫喊“缺粮”的人越来越多，红星三社的问题解决得很好，社员还受到了一次勤俭持家的教育。这个事实又说明了什么呢？也很值得一些忽视政治思想工作的人想一想。
    红星三社的经验，归纳为一点，就是政治思想工作真正的发挥了“统帅”的作用。政治思想工作对实际工作究竟有没有帮助，这里就是一个很好的答案。
