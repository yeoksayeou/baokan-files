    In recent days, a vibrant and energetic young artistic team has appeared on the stages and streets of the capital. They have brought to the people of Beijing a collection of concise, lively, interesting, and closely reflective Yue Opera, drama, song and dance, and storytelling programs. You might think these programs are old hat when you hear the titles: "No Spitting," "A Thousand Miles a Day," "The Girl Who Couldn't Be Locked Up," "Full House Red"… But I guarantee that after seeing them, you will laugh from the bottom of your heart; you will be unconsciously educated; you will feel how lovely the new society is.

    This performing group is the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe. (Lan)

    杭州越剧团到北京街头
    这几天，首都的舞台上和街头，出现了一支朝气蓬勃的青年文艺队伍。他们给首都人民带来了一批短小精悍、生动有趣、密切反映现实生活的越剧、话剧、歌舞、说唱节目。你听了这些节目的题目：“不要随地吐痰”、“一日千里”、“关不住的姑娘”、“满堂红”……也许会觉得是老一套。但是，我敢担保，你看了以后，会衷心地发出笑声；你会不知不觉地从中受到教育；你会感到新社会是多么可爱。
    这个演出团体就是杭州越剧团。　（兰）
