Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: The Chinese Song and Dance Troupe, currently visiting Japan, gave a grand opening performance at the Koma Theatre in Tokyo on the evening of the 10th, receiving a warm welcome from the audience.

That evening, the theatre entrance was decorated with colorful dragon lanterns and huge banners welcoming the song and dance troupe. The over two thousand eight hundred seats inside were completely full, and the audience was very crowded.

Before the performance, an opening ceremony was held. After Sumoto Toshio, the editor-in-chief of the "Mainichi Shimbun," delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the organizing groups, Kubota Mantaro, Chairman of the Welcome Committee for the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe, and Lü Ji, Head of the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe, spoke successively. Lü Ji expressed his gratitude for the invitation and warm reception from the three sponsoring organizations, as well as the warm welcome from the Japanese people. He said that as the cherry blossoms were in full bloom, the Chinese Song and Dance Troupe's visit and performance in Japan had begun. This symbolizes that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and the cultural exchange between the two countries will blossom like beautiful cherry blossoms.

Every performance by our song and dance troupe elicited enthusiastic applause from the audience, and many performances were repeated with curtain calls.

The famous Japanese artist Hanayagi Tokubei said that Chinese folk songs and dances are healthy, bright, and full of youthful spirit. He believes that nothing is better than Chinese folk songs and dances to introduce the new face of China to the Japanese people.

The Chinese Song and Dance Troupe arrived in Tokyo in batches on March 31st and April 4th.
