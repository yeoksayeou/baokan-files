Hometown
Sha Ou

      On the Way
    Still this dirt road,
    Still this osmanthus tree by the road.
    What an intimate place,
    I remember every field clearly.
    The cooperative's office is in that tile-roofed house,
    I see that smiling window.
    How great it would be to meet an acquaintance!
    The things I want to say could fill several rooms.

      Aunt Li
    By the pond in Tuwan,
    I met Aunt Li.
    She recognized me,
    And pulled me to her house.
    She pointed everything out to me,
    And praised her newly married daughter-in-law again and again,
    Mentioning that snowy New Year's Eve...
    She said if it weren't for Chairman Mao,
    Our bones would have rotted long ago!

      Path
    A straight, earth-red path,
    Extends towards a cluster of apricot-yellow thatched houses.
    A long row of melon trellises by the road,
    Millions of golden loofah flowers.
    What a beautiful lace trim this is,
    Holding back the green mountains and forests.
    Joy is hidden in the heart of a Communist Youth League member,
    She has already calculated how much it will increase for the cooperative.

      Mill
    She walks with even steps,
    She sweats around the millstone.
    Her face is red,
    Her eyes are bright.
    She just left school,
    Her "Young Guard" is on the table.
    She loves those forty dairy cows,
    She loves the babies waiting for milk.

      New Home
    White walls, vermillion eaves,
    Magpies sing on the black tiles.
    A Young Pioneer with a schoolbag on his back,
    Greets me with a smile at the door.
    Mom and Dad have gone to the fields,
    Grandmother is also busy at home.
    I tiptoe into the backyard,
    And see a group of piglets wagging their tails around Grandmother.

    故乡
    沙鸥
      途中
    还是这条黄泥巴路，
    路边还是这根桂花树。
    多么亲热的地方呵，
    每一块田我都记得清楚。
    社办公室就在那座瓦房，
    看见了那扇笑着的窗户。
    碰见一个熟人该多好！
    我想说的话能装几间屋。
    李大妈
    在土湾的堰塘边，
    遇见了李大妈。
    她认出是我，
    一把拉到了她的家。
    她把甚么都指给我看，
    把新过门的儿媳妇夸了又夸，
    提起那个落雪的年三十……
    她说不是毛主席，
    骨头早烂啦！
    小路
    笔直的土红色的路，
    伸向一片杏黄色的草屋。
    路边一排长长的瓜架，
    金色的丝瓜花千万朵。
    这是一条多好看的花边，
    把青青的山林拦住。
    喜悦藏在一位共青团员心中，
    她早算好了为社增加多少数目。
    磨房
    她走着均匀的脚步，
    她围着磨盘流着汗。
    她的脸是红红的，
    她的眼珠是亮亮的。
    她刚刚离开学校，
    她的“青年近卫军”在桌子上。
    她喜爱那四十条奶牛，
    她喜爱等着吃奶的婴儿。
    新居
    白的墙，朱红的屋檐，
    喜鹊在黑瓦上唱歌。
    一个红领巾背上书包，
    在门口笑嘻嘻地喊我。
    爹娘都上地去了，
    婆婆在家里也忙着。
    我轻脚轻手走进后院，
    见一群小猪摇着尾巴围着婆婆。
