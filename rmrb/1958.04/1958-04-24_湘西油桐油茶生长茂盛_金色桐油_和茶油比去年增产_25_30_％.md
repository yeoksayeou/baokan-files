Western Hunan's Tung Oil Trees and Tea Oil Plants Flourish
"Golden Tung Oil" and Tea Oil Production Increase by 25-30% Compared to Last Year

(Reported by our newspaper) The "Golden Tung Oil" production area, famous both domestically and internationally – the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture – is now covered with tung oil flowers across the mountains and fields. More than 450,000 mu of young forests, directly sown two or three years ago, are generally beginning to blossom and bear fruit. This year, the autonomous prefecture's tung oil harvesting area will expand from over 700,000 mu last year to over 1.1 million mu, with an estimated production of 200,000 dan of "Golden Tung Oil," a 25% increase compared to last year and a six-fold increase compared to the early post-liberation period. The autonomous prefecture's tea oil forests have also been fully cultivated and tilled this year. The more than 300,000 mu of seedlings newly planted after liberation have all grown to one or two chi tall, displaying lush greenery. This year, the total tea oil harvesting area in the prefecture will be more than 560,000 mu, with an estimated production of 120,000 dan of tea oil, a 39% increase compared to last year.

The Xiangxi mountainous region has a warm climate, abundant rainfall, and fertile, sandy soil, which is very suitable for the growth of tung oil and tea oil forests. Before liberation, the highest annual output of tung oil here reached 290,000 dan, and tea oil reached 180,000 dan. During the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, the tung oil and tea oil industries in Xiangxi suffered severe damage. By the eve of liberation, only 520,000 mu of tung oil forests remained in the prefecture, with an annual tung oil production of only over 30,000 dan. After liberation, thanks to the Party Committee's emphasis and the inclusion of tung oil and tea production in the agricultural production plan, the prefecture has reclaimed more than 400,000 mu of tung oil forests and more than 500,000 mu of tea oil forests in recent years; and newly planted more than 700,000 mu of tung oil forests and more than 300,000 mu of tea oil forests. Last year, the prefecture's tung oil production increased by 70,000 dan compared to the historical average; tea oil production has recovered to 86,000 dan, more than three times the historical average.

    湘西油桐油茶生长茂盛
    “金色桐油”和茶油比去年增产25—30％
    本报讯　驰名国内外的“金色桐油”产区——湘西土家族苗族自治州，油桐花已经开遍山野。两三年前直播的四十五万多亩幼林，普遍开始开花结球。今年，自治州的油桐收获面积将从去年的七十多万亩扩大到一百一十多万亩，预计可产“金色桐油”二十万担，比去年增产25％，比解放初期增产六倍。自治州的油茶林，今年也已全部垦复中耕，解放后新植的三十多万亩幼苗，都长到一两尺高，一片葱绿。今年全州的油茶收获面积将有五十六万多亩，预计可产茶油十二万担，比去年增产39％。
    湘西山区气候暖和，雨量丰富，土壤肥沃、含沙，很适合油桐、油茶林的生长。解放前，这里的桐油最高年产量曾达到二十九万担，茶油曾达到十八万担。在国民党反动统治时期，湘西的油桐油茶遭到严重破坏。解放前夕，全州油桐林只剩下五十二万亩，年产桐油仅三万多担。解放后，由于党委重视，把桐茶生产列入农业生产计划之内，因而几年来全州垦复了油桐林四十多万亩，油茶林五十多万亩；新植了油桐林七十多万亩，油茶林三十多万亩。去年，全州的桐油产量比历史常年产量增加了七万担；茶油产量已恢复到八万六千担，比历史常年产量增加了三倍多。
