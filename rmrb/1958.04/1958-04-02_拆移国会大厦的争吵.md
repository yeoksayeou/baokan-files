    The Quarrel Over Demolishing and Moving the Capitol Building
    One day in mid-March, the gentlemen of Congress in Washington were heatedly discussing countermeasures to deal with the economic recession. Suddenly, the rumbling of bulldozers and cranes came from in front of the Capitol. A group of workers wielding sledgehammers ran up the steps of the Capitol and began to demolish the east front of the Capitol building without explanation.
    The panicked congressmen rushed out to question the workers. The workers said that they were ordered by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr. Rayburn, to carry out the construction, moving the east front of the Capitol forward thirty-two feet to expand the area of the Capitol.
    The congressmen, who were already dizzy with the problem of economic recession, were suddenly reminded by the workers of a bill to expand the Capitol that had been hastily passed in 1955.
    Old News Revisited
    The U.S. Capitol was personally laid by President Washington in 1793. During the American Civil War, thanks to President Lincoln's firm advocacy, a dome was built on the Capitol. Legend has it that Lincoln believed that the dome was a symbol of America's confidence in the future. Due to the increasing number of Congressional staff, the Capitol had long been insufficient. The added side buildings were also of no avail. As early as 1918, some people suggested moving the Capitol forward to expand office space. However, many congressmen believed that the renovation project would damage the dome, which was a household name in the United States. Therefore, although such suggestions were repeatedly put forward, they were never passed.
    A Bolt from the Blue
    In 1955, the U.S. Congress hastily passed a bill appropriating funds to expand the Capitol and established a committee headed by Rayburn. Under Mr. Rayburn's skillful handling, no one except the members of this committee paid attention to the specific content of the expansion plan at the time. More than two years have passed since the bill was passed. The congressmen had long forgotten about it. They also approved plans to build office buildings for the Senate and the House of Representatives. As a result, the third office building of the House of Representatives was completed not long ago, and the second office building of the Senate will also be completed within a few months. However, now suddenly demolishing and moving the main building of the Capitol was truly a bolt from the blue for the unprepared congressmen.
    A Chorus of Protests
    A subcommittee of the Senate convened an emergency meeting, trying to prevent the workers outside the Capitol from starting work. They said that the cost of demolishing and moving the main building of the Capitol and expanding the office space was $200 per square meter, while the cost of building a new office building was only $20 per square meter. Many archaeological associations, architectural associations, and newspapers in Washington also protested, demanding the preservation of historical sites. The congressmen of the House of Representatives may not openly oppose their speaker, but some congressmen also regretted the move to demolish and move the main building of the Capitol.
    The most vocal defender of Rayburn was the Capitol's construction engineer, Stewart. Stewart said that the Capitol was old and in disrepair and should be repaired even if it was not demolished and moved, and that the cost of repairing was not much different from the cost of demolishing and moving. As for the dome, Stewart said that it was an architectural error.
    Favoritism
    Currently, this little episode in Congress has not ended. The congressmen are conducting intense behind-the-scenes activities. The British "Economist" weekly on March 22 revealed that Stewart was not a professional construction engineer at all, but a construction contractor. Therefore, Stewart's enthusiastic support for the costly plan to demolish and move the Capitol was not accidental.
    Demolishing and moving the main building of the Capitol will cost $10.1 million, and the newly built office buildings of the Senate and the House of Representatives have also cost a lot of money. However, the U.S. Congress ignores all requests for appropriations for schools, hospitals, housing construction, etc., and does not contribute a penny. Even the "Washington Post" couldn't help but satirize this situation of favoritism.

### 拆移国会大厦的争吵

    拆移国会大厦的争吵
    3月中旬的一天，华盛顿的议员先生们正在七嘴八舌地议论应付经济衰退的对策。忽然国会大厦前面传来了铲土机、起重机隆隆的声音。一群手持大锤的工人跑上了国会大厦的台阶，不由分说地动起手来拆除国会大厦的东面正屋。
    惊惶失措的议员先生们跑出来向工人质问。工人说，他们是奉众议院议长雷朋先生的命令前来施工，把国会大厦的东面正屋向前推移三十二英尺，以扩展国会大厦的面积的。
    被经济衰退问题闹得头昏脑胀的议员先生们，经过工人们的提醒后，才猛然想起了1955年匆匆地通过的一项扩建国会大厦的法案。
    旧事重提
    美国的国会大厦是1793年由华盛顿总统亲自奠基的。在美国内战时期，由于林肯总统的坚决主张，国会大厦修建了一个圆屋顶。传说林肯认为，这个圆屋顶就是美国对未来的信心的标志。由于国会工作人员日益增多，国会大厦早已不敷应用。添建的侧屋亦无济于事。早在1918年就有人提议把国会大厦向前推进以扩展办公室。但是许多议员认为改建的工程会损坏美国家喻户晓的圆屋顶。所以这种建议虽经一再提出，始终没有通过。
    晴天霹雳
    1955年，美国国会匆匆地通过了一项拨款扩建国会大厦的法案，并成立了以雷朋为首的委员会。在雷朋先生的巧妙手法下，当时除了这个委员会的成员外，没有人注意扩建计划的具体内容。自法案通过后，两年多的时间过去了。议员先生们早已把这件事忘掉了。他们又批准了建造参、众两院办公大楼的计划。于是，众议院第三座办公大楼已在不久以前完工了，参议院第二座办公大楼亦将于数月内竣工。但是，现在突然要拆移国会大厦的正屋，这对于毫无思想准备的议员先生们说来，真是一阵晴天的霹雳。
    一片抗议
    参议院的一个小组委员会召开了紧急会议，竭力阻止国会大厦外面的工人动工。他们说，拆移国会大厦正屋、扩建办公室的费用，每平方公尺二百美元，而新建办公大楼的费用每平方公尺只要二十美元。华盛顿的许多考古协会、建筑协会、新闻报刊也提出了抗议，要求保存名胜古迹。众议院的议员们也许不致公开反对他们的议长，但是也有一些众议员惋惜拆移国会大厦正屋的举动。
    为雷朋辩护最力的是国会建筑工程师施迪瓦特。施迪瓦特说，国会大厦年久失修，不拆移也应修理，而修理的费用与拆移的费用不相上下。至于圆屋顶，施迪瓦特说，那是建筑上的一个错误。
    厚此薄彼
    目前，国会中的这个小插曲还没有完结。议员先生们正在进行紧张的幕后活动。3月22日的英国“经济学家”周刊透露，施迪瓦特根本不是什么职业的建筑工程师，而是一个建筑承包商人。因此，施迪瓦特这样热心地支持耗资巨大的拆移国会大厦的计划，并不是偶然的。
    拆移国会大厦正屋将耗费一千零十万美元，而新建的参众两院的办公大楼也耗费了巨款。但是美国国会对学校、医院、房屋建筑等拨款要求一概置之不理、一毛不拔。这种厚此薄彼的情况，连“华盛顿邮报”都忍不住要讽刺一下了。
