Agricultural Knowledge

    Castor bean, also known as castor seed or large hemp seed, is a promising oil crop, just like sunflower.
    Castor oil has a wide range of industrial uses and is of high value. It is also used as a laxative in medicine. The oilcake after castor oil extraction is a fertilizer with a high nitrogen content. The stems of castor bean can be peeled to produce fiber. In some southern regions, castor bean leaves can also be used to raise castor silkworms, which have many advantages.
    There are several varieties of castor bean, with green-stem and red-stem being the most common in China. In the tropics, castor bean can grow into a tree, reaching a height of over ten meters. In the subtropical regions of China, it is a perennial plant, while in temperate regions, it is an annual plant. Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jilin, Hebei, and other provinces have large-scale planting, and sporadic cultivation is found everywhere. According to statistics from 1956, the national planting area was approximately two million mu, with an average yield of 45.8 jin of castor seed per mu.
    Castor bean also has relatively strong adaptability. It can survive not only in cold, temperate, and tropical zones, but also grow normally in acidic and slightly alkaline soils. Its root system is large and deep, allowing it to absorb nutrients and moisture from deep soil layers, thus resisting a certain degree of drought.
    Annual castor bean is generally sown around the time of "Grain Rain" (usually around April 20th); perennial castor bean can be sown twice, in spring and autumn. In northern regions, castor bean can be planted with a spacing of about two chi five cun (approximately 83 cm) between plants. The management, including fertilization, weeding, and irrigation, is similar to that of general field crops.
    The Ministries of Agriculture and Food issued a call not long ago, urging people in both urban and rural areas to utilize vacant land to plant five to ten sunflower and castor bean plants per person. How beneficial is it to the country to plant five to ten castor bean plants? Based on general estimates, each castor bean plant can produce three to five liang (approximately 150-250 grams) of castor seed, and ten plants can yield two to three jin (approximately 1-1.5 kg) of castor seed. With a 50% oil extraction rate for castor seed, planting ten castor bean plants can produce one to one and a half jin of valuable oil to support national construction.

    蓖麻
    蓖麻也叫蓖麻子、大麻子，它和向日葵一样，也是一种有发展前途的油料作物。
    蓖麻油在工业上用途广、价值高，也是医药中的泻剂；蓖麻榨油以后的油饼，是一种含氮量较大的肥料；蓖麻的茎秆能剥制出纤维。在南方一些地区，蓖麻的叶子还可以饲养优点很多的蓖麻蚕。
    蓖麻有几个变种，我国常见的有青茎、红茎两种。蓖麻在热带树大成林，高十几公尺，在我国亚热带地区是多年生植物，在温带地区是一年生植物。内蒙古、山西、陕西、吉林、河北等省都较大面积的种植，零星栽培各地都有。据1956年统计，全国种植面积约二百万亩，每亩平均产麻子四十五点八斤。
    蓖麻的适应性也比较强，它不仅在寒、温、热三带都能生存，而且在酸性、弱碱性土壤里生长正常。它的根系大、入土深，能由深土层里吸取养分水分，因此能抵抗一定程度的干旱。
    一年生蓖麻一般在“谷雨”前后播种；多年生蓖麻可分春、秋两次播种。北方地区种植的蓖麻，可以每隔二尺五寸左右种植一株，在施肥、锄草、灌溉等管理工作上，和一般大田作物相仿。
    农业、粮食两部在不久以前发出号召，要求城乡人民利用空地，每人种植五到十棵向日葵、蓖麻。种植五到十棵蓖麻对国家有多大好处呢？就一般情况估算，每株蓖麻可产麻子三到五两，十株可收麻子二到三斤。蓖麻子出油率50％，如果种好十株蓖麻，就可以生产一斤到一斤半贵重油料，支援国家建设。
