Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 5th. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio told United Press International reporters on April 3rd that no country was directly interfering in Indonesia, but some were doing so "covertly." He said it would be diplomatically inappropriate to name them.

Referring to Syngman Rhee's statement expressing his willingness to send troops to help the Padang rebel group, Subandrio said that Syngman Rhee "would be delighted to see a world war break out, involving the United States."

When talking about other important issues in Indonesia, Subandrio said: If the West is unwilling to sell us weapons, "we must buy them elsewhere." He added that the Indonesian army is of standard Western style, and a large proportion of army officers are trained in the United States, but "we may have to change." He said, we cannot have an army without weapons.

He said that the Indonesian government is trying to buy ships from Yugoslavia, Poland, Germany, Belgium, and even the Netherlands. He said he hoped to establish Indonesia's own shipbuilding industry in Surabaya this year.

    苏班德里约外长指责说
    外国暗地干涉印度尼西亚
    据新华社雅加达5日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约3日对合众社记者说，没有一个国家是在直接干涉印度尼西亚，但是有些是在“隐蔽地”这样做。他说，点它们的名是不合外交做法的。
    谈到李承晚表示愿意派军队帮助巴东叛乱集团的声明时，苏班德里约说，李承晚“巴不得看到发生一场美国也卷进去的世界大战”。
    苏班德里约谈到印度尼西亚的其它重要问题时说：如果西方不愿意卖武器给我们，“我们必须向其他地方去买”。他又说，印度尼西亚军队是标准的西方式的，陆军军官中有很大一部分是美国训练的，但是“我们可能不得不改变。”他说，我们不能有军队而没有武器。
    他说，印度尼西亚政府正在设法向南斯拉夫、波兰、德国、比利时甚至荷兰购买船只。他说，他希望今年能在泗水建立印度尼西亚自己的造船工业。
