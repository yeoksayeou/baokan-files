Intellectuals' Four-Character Classic
	Eyes look downward, ambition upward. Firmly establish your stance, tightly clamp your tail. Learn revolutionary drive from the Communist Youth League, learn unwavering loyalty from veteran cadres. Improve work, more, faster, better, and more economical. Sweep away the five airs, be red and expert. Going up to the mountains and down to the countryside is the only way. Keep in step to the left, confide in the Party. Three years of hard struggle, the four-character true scripture!

    知识分子四字经
    袁水拍眼睛向下，志气向上。立场站稳，尾巴夹紧。向青年团学革命干劲，向老干部学忠心耿耿。改进工作，多快好省。横扫五气，红透专深。上山下乡，不二法门。向左看齐，向党交心。三年苦战，四字真经！
