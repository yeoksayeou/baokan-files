    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st: Shanghai mobilized two and a half million people on the 20th in a sudden attack to catch flies and mosquitoes, achieving the astonishing result of catching three million of them.
    The vast majority of these flies and mosquitoes were caught in places where flies and mosquitoes breed, such as fish processing plants, wool and bone workshops, pastures, and green areas.
    Many newly molted flies were found on the grass in the green areas. This was recently discovered by an employee of a hospital who accidentally caught them with a net on the lawn. He tested his new fly-catching tool for the first time and caught 700 flies and 100 mosquitoes in one hour. Other hospitals also learned to use white nets to catch them on the lawn, with extremely high efficiency. A sanatorium caught more than 30,000 in one afternoon. Later, three carpenters and electricians installed it on the front wheel of a bicycle, and people rode bicycles to catch them on the lawn, with even greater effect. On the 20th, this new tool appeared in parks and green areas throughout the city. According to statistics from parks throughout the city, 100,000 flies were caught.
    On the 17th, Shanghai also launched a war of encirclement and annihilation against flies and mosquitoes, with one million people participating. Shanghai will seize the current season when it is warm and pests are newly emerging, continue to make surprise attacks, and repeatedly fight against mosquitoes and flies.

    上海二百五十万人齐出动
    一天歼灭蚊蝇三百万只
    新华社上海21日电　上海二百五十万人20日突击捕捉苍蝇和蚊子，获得了捕捉三百万只的惊人战果。
    这许多苍蝇、蚊子绝大多数是在鱼品加工厂、毛骨作、牧场等孳生蝇蚊的场所和绿化地带捉到的。
    绿化地带的草地上有很多刚蜕化的苍蝇，这是最近由一个医院的职工用网兜在草坪上偶然捕捞时发现的。他第一次试验他的捕蝇新工具，在一小时内就捕捉到了苍蝇七百只，蚊子一百只。其他医院也都学习用白色网兜在草坪上捕捞，效率极高。有个疗养院在一个下午就捕捉到三万多只。后来又经三个木工和水电工人把它装置在自行车的前轮上，人骑着自行车在草坪上兜捕，效果更大。20日全市的公园和绿化地带都出现了这种新工具，据全市公园统计，捕到苍蝇十万只。
    在17日的时候，上海也曾发动过一次对苍蝇、蚊子的围歼战，有一百万人参加。上海市将抓紧目前春暖害虫新生的时节，继续突击，与蚊蝇害虫进行反复斗争。
