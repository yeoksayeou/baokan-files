Xinhua News Agency, 31st: "Education at all levels must be built on the foundation of scientific research; we must establish an educational science that comes from educational practice and returns to practice to guide it." This was stated by Liu Shi, leader of the Education Group of the State Council's Science Planning Commission, at a symposium on the Great Leap Forward held by the Commission for educational science researchers on the 30th.

Liu Shi said that this year's educational science research should first be combined with the needs of the country, studying the new problems posed by the new situation to educational work. For example, the mass line in educational work, literacy campaigns, universal primary education, vocational middle schools (mainly agricultural middle schools), work-study programs, teacher training, and the series of issues in educational systems, teaching plans, teaching content, and teaching methods arising from these. He said that we must vigorously study and summarize the educational experience of the old liberated areas; study and summarize the experience and lessons of various educational undertakings since the founding of New China. On the basis of carrying out research work, we must establish our educational science within two to three years.

Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng, Vice Minister Dong Chuncai, and Director of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau Weng Dujian, all spoke at the meeting. Wang Xizhang, Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education, who is attending the Fourth National Education Administrative Conference, introduced Henan Province's advanced experiences in literacy campaigns, universal primary education, and people-run middle schools. Wu Tianshi, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, introduced Jiangsu Province's advanced experience in the rapid development of agricultural middle schools. Sun Taolin, Vice President of East China Normal University, said at the meeting that educational science is seriously divorced from reality. Now, their school's education department has sent an investigation team to Henan to systematically study the work-study experience of Changge No. 3 Middle School and Zhengzhou Junior No. 7 Middle School, as well as the experience of Yancheng County in popularizing junior high school and primary school education, and then enrich the teaching.

Psychology researchers attending the meeting proposed research projects in educational psychology. Pan Shu, Director of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that current educational psychology will consider concentrating on studying children's psychology and age characteristics, the cultivation of moral character, and the psychological research of various teaching methods.

Cao Fu, a researcher from the Preparatory Office of the Institute of Educational Science, believes that the research work of educational history should also take a Great Leap Forward. National forces should be concentrated to cooperate and conduct a series of special studies.

Dai Baitao, director of the preparatory office of the Educational Science Research Institute, on behalf of the more than fifty educational science researchers in the capital who attended the meeting, proposed the organization of the Beijing Educational Society.

Participating in this symposium were educational science researchers from the capital, heads of the Ministry of Education, directors of education departments and bureaus from various provinces and cities attending the Fourth National Education Administrative Conference, and representatives from some higher normal schools.

    新形势要求建立教育科学
    教育科学研究工作者座谈大跃进
    据新华社31日讯　“各级教育事业必须建立在科学研究的基础上；必须建立从教育实践中来，又回到实践，指导实践的教育科学。”这是国务院科学规划委员会教育组组长柳湜30日在国务院科学规划委员会召集的教育科学研究工作者座谈大跃进的会上说的。
    柳湜说，今年教育科学研究工作首先要结合国家的需要，研究新形势对教育工作方面所提出的新问题。例如教育工作中的群众路线、扫盲、普及小学、职业中学（主要是农业中学）、勤工俭学、师资培养等问题，以及由此引起的教育制度、教学计划、教学内容、教学方法上的一系列的问题。他说，要大力研究和总结老解放区教育经验；研究和总结新中国成立以来各项教育事业的经验、教训。要在开展研究工作的基础上，在两三年内建立我们的教育科学。
    教育部部长杨秀峰、副部长董纯才、北京市教育局局长翁独健，都在会上讲了话。正在出席第四次全国教育行政会议的河南省教育厅副厅长王锡璋，在会上介绍了河南省在扫盲、普及小学、民办中学等方面的先进经验，江苏省教育厅厅长吴天石介绍了江苏省迅速发展农业中学的先进经验。华东师范大学副校长孙陶林在会上说，教育科学脱离实际很严重，现在他们学校教育系已经派出调查组到河南去，系统地研究长葛第三中学、郑州初级第七中学的勤工俭学经验，以及郾城县普及初中和小学教育的经验，然后丰富到教学中去。
    到会的心理学研究工作者提出了教育心理方面的研究项目。中国科学院心理学研究所所长潘菽说，当前教育心理学将考虑集中力量研究儿童心理和年龄特征、道德品质培养以及各种教学的教学心理研究等问题。
    教育科学研究所筹备处研究工作者曹孚认为，教育史的研究工作也要来个大跃进，应集中全国力量通力合作，进行一系列的专题研究。
    教育科学研究所筹备处主任戴白韬代表到会的五十多名首都教育科学研究工作者，倡议组织北京市教育学会。
    参加这次座谈会的有首都的教育科学研究工作者，教育部的负责人，参加第四次全国教育行政会议的各省市教育厅、局长，以及部分高等师范学校的代表。
