    Oil Extraction Workers Remember the Prospectors

    Recently, we came again to the site of Longnüsi Well No. 2, the first oil well in the central Sichuan oil region. The spring sunshine shines through the oil derrick erected on the bank of the Jialing River, obliquely onto the pool that stores several hundred tons of deep black natural petroleum. An oil spring gushes out of the steel pipe and into the pool, the oil waves rising and falling, shimmering with dazzling brilliance.
    The exciting scene of the oil gushing out more than a month ago has not yet faded from people's memories. Now, well testing is continuing here, and preparations for production are being carried out intensely. Drilling workers open the wellhead on time, constantly observing and studying the oil production situation of the oil layer.
    When the roaring oil flow gushes out from the bottom of the well continuously, people cannot help but think of those geological prospectors who work diligently in the field all year round. They experienced a difficult and tortuous process in discovering the Longnüsi oil-bearing structure.
    Four years ago, in winter, a field exploration team of the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau completed the petroleum geological survey of Penglai Town, Pengxi County, and continued to survey eastward along the exposed rock strata. When they came to Moxi in Tongnan County, based on the topographic and geological characteristics here, they believed that it was likely to become an oil-bearing structure. The young exploration team members were reluctant to give up this unexpected gain. Although there were only a few days left before the end of the year and the return to Chengdu, they still seized the time to work and finally wrote the information of the "Moxi Structure" into their exploration report. At that time, petroleum geological work in Sichuan was just beginning, and there was not much data available, and even fewer places suitable for drilling for oil. Therefore, the "Moxi Structure" attracted great attention. The following spring, the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau immediately sent a surveying team to Moxi, and then sent geological technician Luo Zhili with a team of people to conduct a detailed exploration.
    Unexpectedly, Luo Zhili returned to Chengdu more than a month later. The report said that the "Moxi Structure" did not exist at all. They had taken topographic maps, relying on theodolites and compasses, and surveyed more than 100 kilometers, but the strata seen along the way were very gentle, and the rock layers did not dip downward. These phenomena fully demonstrated in geology that Moxi was not a place to store oil. Since the claim that Moxi might have oil was denied, the surveying team stationed in Moxi was also withdrawn. Since then, the name Moxi gradually faded from the minds of geological personnel. Only when talking about experiences and lessons would people regard it as an error case, and few people boldly imagined that it really had the potential to store oil. Another year passed. In the winter of 1955, China's petroleum industry delegation returned from visiting the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's experience in discovering the Second Baku on the Russian Platform pointed out a broad path for Chinese geological personnel. The geological conditions in the area between the Huaying Mountains and the Tuojiang River in Sichuan Province were similar to the Russian Platform. Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Mirchink, suggested to Chinese petroleum geologists that large-scale exploration work be carried out here. According to the instructions of the Party and the experience of the Soviet Union, the Sichuan Petroleum Prospecting Brigade of the Ministry of Geology decided to conduct exploration in this area of central Sichuan. At that time, they only knew the term Moxi in central Sichuan, which had already been negated.
    However, based on the deduction of topographic and geological data, they believed that there was oil here. They believed that the possibility of Moxi having oil storage mentioned by the field exploration team of the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau still existed, and this clue should be seized and pursued to find a place suitable for oil storage. Therefore, in the spring of 1956, the Sichuan Petroleum Prospecting Brigade of the Ministry of Geology withdrew all the surveying teams originally deployed in Meishan, Jiajiang, Qianwei, and Leshan areas in western Sichuan and went to central Sichuan, starting exploration work with the force of a large army.
    While exploring, they prepared for detailed surveys and drilling wells. However, things did not go as smoothly as expected. From west to east, passing through Moxi, the strata conditions they saw were the same as those seen by the field team members of the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau during their detailed survey later. Where exactly was the oil-bearing structure? It was difficult to determine for a while. Because of this, the captain and engineers were very anxious and rushed from Chongqing to the site four times to study and discuss with everyone, encouraging the field team members not to be discouraged and to find an oil-bearing geological structure. The local farmers were deeply moved when they saw the field team members measuring and hammering rocks on the slopes and riverbanks every day, regardless of the wind and rain. Some offered their good houses to accommodate them, and some took out food to feed them. The care of the leaders and the support of the broad masses of the people encouraged the staff of the Petroleum Prospecting Brigade to continue to pursue the clues of the Moxi petroleum structure. They advanced forward, crossed the Jialing River, and continued eastward, meticulously surveying 1,800 square kilometers, finally finding an area suitable for oil storage in the territory of Wusheng and Yuechi counties. When they spread out the topographic map by the Jialing River and filled in their gains, they saw that the underground oil mountain hidden here was 600 square kilometers in size, and they were truly unspeakably happy.
    The petroleum geological structure was found, but this was only the beginning. Then, they wanted to use light drilling rigs to drill wells in order to further confirm whether there was oil stored underground. However, the peak of this underground oil mountain had not yet been found. Where should they drill wells? According to the drilling method, the first exploratory well should be drilled on the underground mountain peak, which is usually the place where the most oil is stored. Drilling personnel call the underground mountain peak the "high point." The new difficulties made the field prospecting team members uneasy. They chased along the rock strata under the hot sun during the day; at night, they stayed under the kerosene lamp to carefully analyze the data. They found that every time they found the edge of the Jialing River, they lost the clue of the high point. Once, they followed the rock strata, crossed the river, and finally found the peak of the underground oil mountain that crossed the Jialing River.
    According to the division of labor stipulated by the state, where the Ministry of Geology is responsible for prospecting and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry is responsible for proving the reserves, the petroleum prospecting personnel of the Ministry of Geology would hand over this exploration result to the drilling personnel of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry. However, what was the name of this structure? The local villagers had such a legend: In the past, the third daughter of the Dragon King of the Jialing River envied human life and often ran out of the Crystal Palace, sitting on the rocks in the heart of the river, looking at the picturesque, spring-like scenery; if the years were dry, she would also call the wind and rain to bring blessings to the world. In order to commemorate this lovely girl, people built temples in the mountains by the river. Now, the high point of the petroleum geological structure has been found here, so the petroleum prospecting personnel of the Ministry of Geology named it Longnüsi, calling it the Longnüsi structure.
    Soon, the light shallow drilling rigs of the Ministry of Geology started operating in the Longnüsi exploration area. The large drilling rigs of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry were also erected by the Jialing River in the winter of 1957. On February 1 this year, the No. 4 shallow well drilled by the Ministry of Geology brought the first good news. Workers used the method of lifting and retrieving, once retrieving more than five tons of crude oil from the well. This news spread throughout Sichuan. Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping of the State Council, who was inspecting work in Chengdu, attached great importance to this achievement and made a special phone call to Beijing to call the two vice ministers of the Ministry of Geology, He Chang Gong, and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, Kang Shi En, to deploy a larger drilling network. In March, the No. 2 deep well drilled by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry also gushed out a large amount of natural petroleum. The Longnüsi oil field was confirmed.
    Now, the Sichuan Petroleum Prospecting Brigade of the Ministry of Geology has embarked on a new journey to find more "Longnüsi" for the motherland. Their work is not the gradually rising high-rise buildings, nor the excellent machines and cars unloaded from the conveying devices; but to find those underground palaces that store a large amount of "black gold"—petroleum structures.

    采油难忘勘查人
    新华社记者  李绍伊
    四川石油工人报记者　王功济
    最近我们又来到川中油区第一个喷油的龙女寺二号井工地上。春天的阳光穿过矗立在嘉陵江边的石油井架，斜射到储积了几百吨深黑色天然石油的池子里。一股油泉从钢管中倾泻而出，注入池中，油浪起伏不已，闪灼着绚丽夺目的光彩。
    一个多月以前激动人心的喷油情景，还未从人们的印象中消去，现在，这里又接着试验油井，紧张地进行着生产前的准备工作。钻井职工按时打开井口，不断地考察和研究着油层的出油情况。
    当呼啸的油流源源不绝地从井底喷出来的时候，人们不得不想到那些终年终日辛勤劳动在野外的地质勘探人员。他们在发现龙女寺储油构造时，曾经经历了一段艰苦而曲折的过程。
    四年前的冬天，四川石油勘探局的一支野外勘查队，完成了蓬溪县蓬莱镇的石油地质调查工作以后，继续沿着露出地面的岩层向东踏勘。当他们来到潼南县境的磨溪时，根据这里的地形地质特征，认为很可能成为一个储积石油的构造。年青的勘探队员舍不得丢掉这个意外的收获，虽然离年底收队回成都的时间只有几天了，但是仍然抓紧工作，终于把“磨溪构造”的资料写进了他们的勘查报告里。当时，四川境内的石油地质工作刚刚开始，掌握的资料不多，可供钻探石油的地方更少。因此，“磨溪构造”引起了极大的注意。第二年春天，四川石油勘探局便立即派出测量队到磨溪，接着又派地质技术员罗志立带着一队人员前去详细勘查。
    出人意料，罗志立一个多月以后回到成都。报告说，“磨溪构造”根本就不存在。他们曾经拿着地形图，依靠经纬仪和罗盘，调查了一百多公里，但是沿途所见的地层都很平缓，岩层并未向下倾斜。这些现象在地质学上，都充分说明磨溪不是一个储积石油的地方。既然磨溪可能有石油的说法被否定了，摆在磨溪的测量队也跟着撤走了。从此，磨溪这个地名逐渐在地质人员的脑子里淡漠起来，只有谈起经验教训的时候，人们才把它当作一件错误事例，而很少有人大胆设想过它确有储积石油的可能。又过了一年，1955年冬天，我国石油工业访苏代表团回来了。苏联在俄罗斯地台上发现第二巴库的经验，给中国的地质人员指出了一条宽广的道路。四川省内华蓥山和沱江之间的地区，地质情况恰似俄罗斯地台。苏联科学院通讯院士米尔琴柯曾经向我国石油地质人员建议，在这里开展大规模的勘查工作。地质部四川石油普查大队根据党的指示和苏联的经验，决定要在川中这块地方进行勘查。当时，他们只知道川中磨溪这个已被否定了的名词。
    但是他们根据地形地质资料的推断，相信这里有油。他们认为四川石油勘探局野外勘查队说磨溪有石油储积的可能性依然存在，应当抓住这条线索跟踪追击，找出一个适于储油的地方来。于是在1956年春天，地质部四川石油普查大队把原来布置在川西眉山、夹江、犍为、乐山一带的勘测队全部撤下，开到川中，以千军万马之势开始了勘测工作。
    他们一边勘查，一边就准备着细测和打钻井。但是，事情并没有预想的那样顺当。从西向东，经过磨溪，他们看到的地层情况，也同四川石油勘探局的野外队员们后来详查时所见到的一样。储油构造究竟在哪里呢？一时也难确定。为了这事，大队长和工程师都很着急，四次从重庆赶到现场，跟大家一起研究讨论，鼓励野外队员们不要灰心，一定要找出一个储油的地质构造来。当地的农民们看到野外队员们不顾风、不怕雨，成天在山坡上、河坎边测量，敲岩石，很受感动。有的让出自己的好房子招待他们住，有的拿出粮食给他们吃。领导人员的关怀和广大人民群众的支援，鼓舞着石油普查大队的工作人员，继续追寻磨溪石油构造的线索。他们向前挺进，渡过了嘉陵江，一直向东，细测了一千八百平方公里，终于在武胜、岳池两县境内，找到了一个适宜于石油储积的地区。当他们在嘉陵江边摊开地形图，填上自己的收获时，看到这里隐伏在地下的石油山有六百平方公里大，心里真有说不出的高兴。
    石油地质构造找到了，但是这还只是一个开端。接着，他们就想用轻便钻机打井，以便进一步证实地下是否储有石油。但是，这个地下石油山的山峰还没有找到，往那里打钻井呢？按照钻探打井方法，第一口探井要打在地下的山峰上，这里通常是聚存石油最多的地方。钻探人员都把地下山峰称为高点。新的困难使野外普查队员不能安宁下来。他们白天顶着火热的太阳，沿着岩层追寻；夜晚又守在煤油灯下仔细地分析着资料。他们发现，每次总是一找到嘉陵江边，就失去了高点的线索。有一次，他们追寻着岩层，渡过江水，终于发现了那条穿过嘉陵江的地下石油山的山峰。
    按照国家规定的地质部管普查、石油工业部负责探明储量的分工，地质部石油普查人员就要把这个勘探成果交给石油工业部的钻探人员。但是，这个构造叫什么名字呢？当地的老乡们有这样一个传说：从前，嘉陵江龙王爷的三女儿羡慕人间生活，常常跑出水晶宫，坐在江心的岩石上，瞻望风景如画、四季如春的景色；如果年成干旱，她还会呼风唤雨，降福人间。人们为了纪念这个可爱的姑娘，就在江边的山间建立了庙宇。现在，石油地质构造的高点在这里发现了，地质部石油普查人员就以龙女寺命名，称它为龙女寺构造。
    不久，地质部的轻便浅钻机在龙女寺探区开动起来。石油工业部的大型钻机，也在1957年冬天竖立在嘉陵江边。今年2月1日，地质部钻探的四号浅井，第一次传出了喜讯。工人们采用提捞的办法，一次从井里捞出五吨多原油。这个消息飞遍了四川。正在成都视察工作的国务院副总理邓小平非常重视这个成果，特地打电话到北京把地质部何长工和石油工业部康世恩两位副部长叫来，布置了一个规模较大的钻探网。3月，石油工业部钻探的二号深井，又接着喷出了大量的天然石油。龙女寺油田被证实了。
    现在，地质部四川石油普查大队又踏上了新途，去为祖国寻找更多的“龙女寺”。他们的工作，不是逐渐增高的高楼大厦，也不是从传送装置上卸下来的出色的机器和汽车；而是去寻找那些储藏着大量“黑色金子”的地下宫殿——石油构造。
