Why?

    Plant Leaves Exuding Water
    Plant roots have a great ability to press the absorbed water up to the branches and leaves; this ability is called "root pressure." In spring, the root pressure of plants is the greatest, so there is also a lot of water in the branches and leaves. During the day, under sunlight, most of the water in the leaves is lost through transpiration. At night, after the plant absorbs water, there is more water in the body than during the day. In the morning, the temperature is low, the air is humid, and transpiration is small, so the excess water in the body is secreted from the water pores or special drainage cells on the edges of the leaves. This phenomenon is called "guttation." This is a normal physiological phenomenon. Through guttation, plants can excrete excess salts from their bodies. Especially plants growing in saline soil need to use guttation to excrete the excessive sodium chloride they have absorbed.

专栏：为什么？

    植物的叶子出水
    植物的根有很大的能力把吸收的水分压送到上部的枝叶中去，这种能力叫做“根压”。春季，植物的根压最大，所以枝叶里的水也很多。白天在日光照射下，叶子里的水大部分都被蒸腾散失了。夜间，植物吸水后，体内的水分就比白天多。早晨的温度低、空气湿润、蒸腾小，体内过多的水就从叶缘的水孔或特殊排水细胞中分泌出来，这种现象叫做“吐水作用”。这是一种正常生理现象，通过吐水作用，植物能把体内多余的盐类物质排出体外。特别是在盐土上生长的植物，都需要通过吐水作用把它们吸收过多的氯化钠排出。　（洪）
