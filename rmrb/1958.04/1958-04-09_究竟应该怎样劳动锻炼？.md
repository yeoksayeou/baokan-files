    How Exactly Should Labor Training Be Conducted?
    Doing Social Work Is Greatly Beneficial for Ideological Remolding
    Here, I would like to express my opinion on the question of whether "doing social work is beneficial for one's own training and remolding."

    When I first arrived at the Youyi Agricultural Cooperative for labor, the township leaders wanted me to do some social work in addition to labor. At that time, although I agreed, I had similar thoughts to Comrade Yu Zhiming! Participating in social work is not beneficial for one's own labor training. However, after two months of practicing social work, it has proven that this idea is completely wrong. Because through doing social work, I came into contact with more people in the township and agricultural cooperative, and I learned more about the situation in rural areas. In particular, from many new people and new things, I saw more clearly the many valuable things in the laboring farmers, and saw the farmers' great ambition and desire to create a better future, which further inspired and improved my class consciousness.

    For example, I worked as a propagandist in water conservancy construction. Through this work, I saw the great spirit and revolutionary vigor shown by the agricultural cooperative members in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward. In order to catch up with the time, the reservoir project was carried out day and night, and under the slogan of not celebrating the Spring Festival until the reservoir was completed, they persisted in working day and night in the severe cold of minus twenty degrees. Old man Lu Guangtai, who was seventy-three years old, worked in chest-high water like the young people, and persisted for three days and three nights, unwilling to rest. Wu Fumin, the deputy secretary of the township party committee who worked with me, although one of his legs was crippled, took the lead in going into the water to build the reservoir, supporting his body with crutches. During the tense stage of the project, he didn't close his eyes for a whole week, and often only ate one meal a day, but he was not tired at all, and always worked vigorously. The collective creative power, the cooperative members' tenacious perseverance in fighting against the severe cold and ice, and the enthusiastic revolutionary vigor deeply educated me, making me forget the severe cold and ice, forget the fatigue and difficulties. In addition to participating in labor every day, I also mustered the courage to write big-character posters, radio scripts, quick rhymes and short poems overnight to praise these heroes. At this time, I felt that it was my honor, not a burden, to be able to contribute my meager cultural knowledge to the countryside.

    For example, I helped the large cooperative with its Great Leap Forward plan. Cao Qigui, the production team leader, and Zhang Rengui, the captain, worked with us to draw topographic maps. Old Cao injured his foot while driving a cart, and it had been inflamed for several days and he couldn't move. When he heard that the cooperative was planning the Great Leap Forward, he insisted on guiding us. He said, "The foot pain doesn't matter, the Great Leap Forward is a big deal, with me, you will definitely draw the map correctly." He laboriously leaned on his crutches and led us through every piece of land in the brigade. He didn't rest even though the wound was bleeding along the way. Production Captain Zhang Rengui also didn't bother to eat, and ran with us all day from eight in the morning to eight in the evening. A strong wind of six or seven degrees was blowing on the ground. In the afternoon, Comrade Yan Bu Liang and I were so cold and hungry that we were dizzy and couldn't stand it, but our production captain, he was always energetic and strode ahead, excitedly pointing out to us: A small hydroelectric power station will be built here, a livestock farm there, a vegetable area here, and a spare-time agricultural technology school will be established there..." In front of him, cold and hunger did not exist at all, but a spring scene of a socialist countryside with flowers and fruits everywhere and ponds full of fresh fish.

    From this, it can be seen that the participation of sent-down cadres in social work not only does not affect labor training, but on the contrary enriches the content of labor training and is by no means dispensable.

    This kind of thinking is wrong
    From Yu Zhiming's letter, it can be seen that his view of "red" and "expert" is incorrect. He sees "red" very simply, believing that he can become "red" after a year and a half of labor. This kind of "gilding" idea will not help him truly transform his thinking and fully train himself to become a class-conscious, diligent, and wholeheartedly serving the people servant.

    In the beginning, a not-so-long period, many of our comrades had the same views as Comrade Yu Zhiming: coming down is just for labor, and they are not very willing to do some social work. Slowly, we felt that this was not right. The masses respected us and kept us at a distance, and we also appeared isolated among the masses. How could this transform our thinking and become intellectuals of the working people? With the help of the Party organization, we gradually intervened in social activities. Through these activities, we realized that social activities are inseparable from labor training. For example, we did not all have a correct and profound understanding of the issue of cooperation, the issue of unified purchase and sale of grain, etc. However, when we personally participated in the activities of great blooming, great contending, and great debate, on the one hand, our understanding was tested by the masses, and on the other hand, we learned the experience of class struggle through the different reflections of various classes, and our ideological understanding level was improved. How can we become "red" without doing social work?

    究竟应该怎样劳动锻炼？
    做社会工作对思想改造大有好处
    这里，仅就“做社会工作究竟对自己的锻炼和改造有没有好处”这个问题，发表一点意见。
    初到友谊农业社劳动不久，乡领导上要我在劳动之外作一点社会工作。当时，我虽然答允了，但也有余志明同志类似的想法！参加社会工作对自己的劳动锻炼没有什么好处。但是，经过两个月来作社会工作的实践，证明这种想法是完全错误的。因为通过作社会工作，使我接触到乡里和农业社里更多的人，使我了解到农村更多的情况，特别是从许多新人新事当中，使我更清楚地看到了劳动农民身上许多宝贵的东西，看到了农民对创造美好将来的宏志大愿，进一步启发和提高了我的阶级觉悟。
    譬如在兴修水利中我担任了宣传员的工作。通过这项工作，使我看到了在大跃进高潮中农业社员表现出的气吞山河的伟大气魄和革命干劲。他们为了赶在时间前面，水库工程昼夜进行，在不修完水库不过春节的口号下，夜以继日地在零下二十度的严寒里坚持干活。七十三岁的路广泰老大爷和青年们一样在齐胸的水里工作，一直坚持了三天三夜，还不肯下来休息。和我在一起干活的乡党委副书记武福民，虽然有一条腿已经残废，但在修水库的时候，还是带头下水，用拐棍支着身体干活。工程紧张阶段，他整整一个星期没有合上眼，经常是整天只吃一顿饭，但他毫无倦色，始终精神奕奕地工作。集体的创造力量，社员们与严寒冰冻斗争的顽强毅力和热火朝天的革命干劲深深地教育了我，使我忘记了严寒冰冻，忘记了疲劳和困难，每天除参加劳动之外还鼓起勇气连夜赶写大字报、广播稿、快板和短诗来歌颂这些英雄们。这时，我感到能够把我仅有的一点文化知识贡献给农村是自己的光荣而不是累赘了。
    再如我帮助大社搞跃进规划，同我们一起画地形图的是生产组长曹起贵和队长张仁贵。老曹因赶大车碰伤脚，并且已经发炎好几天不能走动。他一听是社里搞跃进规划一定要给我们作引导。他说：“脚痛不碍事，跃进可是大事哪，有我，你们画图准没错。”他吃力地拄着拐领我们踏遍了大队的每一块地，一路上伤口流血也不休息。生产队长张仁贵也是连饭都顾不得吃，从早上八点到晚上八点和我们跑一整天。地上刮着六、七级大风，到下半晌，我和晏部梁同志跑得又冷又饿，头昏眼黑，顶不住了，而我们的生产队长呢，他一直是精神抖擞地健步在前，兴奋地指给我们说：这儿要修一座小型水力发电站，那里是畜牧场，这里是蔬菜区，那里要建立业余农业技术中学……。”在他面前，寒冷和饥饿根本不存在，而是一幅花果遍野、鲜鱼满塘的社会主义农村春景。
    由此可见，下放干部参加社会工作不但不影响劳动锻炼，相反更丰富了劳动锻炼的内容，决不是可有可无的。

    这种想法是不对的
    从余志明的来信中可以看出他对“红”与“专”的看法是不正确的，他把“红”看得非常简单，只要经过一年半载的劳动就可以“红”了。这种类似“镀金”的想法，不会帮助自己真正的改造思想，全面锻炼成为一个阶级立场鲜明，勤勤恳恳，全心全意为人民服务的勤务员。
    在最初一个不长时期，我们也曾有过许多同志抱有和余志明同志同样的看法：下来就是劳动，对于一些社会工作也是不大愿意作的。慢慢的我们感到这样下去并不对头，群众对我们敬而远之，我们在群众中也显得孤立，这怎会改造自己的思想成为劳动人民的知识分子呢？在党组织的帮助下，我们渐渐地向社会活动方面插手了。通过这些活动，我们了解到社会活动是同劳动锻炼分不开的。比如我们对于合作化问题，粮食统购统销问题等等，并不是都认识得很正确，感受得很深刻的，可是，当我们亲身参加了大鸣大放大辩论活动，一方面通过群众检验了我们的认识，另方面通过各个阶级不同的反映，学得阶级斗争的经验，我们的思想认识水平就提高了。不作社会工作，怎么能“红”呢？
