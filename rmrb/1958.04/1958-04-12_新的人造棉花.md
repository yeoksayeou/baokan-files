    New Man-Made Cotton
    Recently, the Shidai Textile Factory in Guiping, Guangxi, and the Jianhua Cotton Spinning Cooperative in Yulin have successfully trial-produced man-made cotton using rice straw, wild hemp, and banana tree bark as raw materials.
    The production process of these man-made cottons is relatively simple. For example, the method used by the Jianhua Cotton Spinning Cooperative in Yulin is as follows: first, the hemp and rice straw are cut into one-inch lengths, soaked, and then squeezed dry. They are then placed in an alkaline solution for steaming to decompose the fibers. After removing the alkali, they are placed in a fat solution to soften and fluff the fibers. Finally, they are bleached and dried.
    Rice straw cotton, yellow hemp cotton, and wild hemp cotton are slightly coarser and harder than natural cotton fibers; green hemp cotton, on the other hand, is softer than natural cotton fibers and has a bright luster, making it a complete substitute for natural cotton.

    新的人造棉花
    广西桂平时代纺织厂和玉林建华棉纺社，最近利用稻草、野麻和芭蕉树皮作原料，先后试制成功人造棉花。
    这些人造棉制作过程比较简单，如玉林建华棉纺社的作法是：先将麻类、稻草切成一寸长，浸后榨干，放入含碱溶液中蒸煮，使纤维分解；脱碱后再放入脂肪溶液，使纤维软化松浮，最后漂白晒干即成。
    稻草棉、黄麻棉、野麻棉比天然棉纤维稍粗硬；青麻棉则比天然棉的纤维柔软，并有雪亮光泽，完全可以代替天然棉使用。
