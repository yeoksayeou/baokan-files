    Eliminating the Decadent Atmosphere Among Intellectuals
    Lu Ge
    Our era is truly an extraordinary one. Opening the newspaper, one's eyes are filled with reports of victories in production and good news of leaps forward in all areas of work. Whether in factories, in the countryside, in schools, in neighborhoods, or in every corner of the motherland, everywhere is permeated with enthusiasm for building socialism. The advanced are surpassing the advanced, high tides are following high tides, and the people of the whole country are exerting their utmost efforts, striving to go upstream, and struggling to build our great socialist motherland.
    However, in such days, a small number of intellectuals hold a negative and bewildered attitude, are not interested in the booming construction cause, lack affection for the ever-changing new things, and express indifference to the raging revolutionary struggle. Some bury themselves in piles of old books, turning a deaf ear to what is happening outside the window; others maintain a general political performance, content to be a middle-of-the-road person. According to the exposures of the "double-anti" movement in higher education institutions, some old teachers believe that senior intellectuals should "maintain tranquility (engage in fewer political movements) to achieve distance (focus on scientific research)," some old teachers only ask to be "guests" of socialism, and many even hold a "gray outlook on life," believing that "life is like a dream," and "one day is gone, and two and a half days have passed." One professor visited a steel factory and was not excited by anything he saw, only noticing the white smoke coming out of the large chimney, saying "that's really beautiful," taking a picture, and then returning. The entire social situation is vigorous and enthusiastic, while their mood is like that described in Li Qingzhao's "Slow, Slow Tune": "Searching and searching, bleak and desolate, so sad, so tragic, so miserable."
    Li Qingzhao was a female poet of the feudal era who encountered turmoil and sadly lost her husband. "Searching and searching, bleak and desolate, so sad, so tragic, so miserable" vividly portrays the feelings of a widow. But why do our intellectuals, born in this prosperous and rapidly changing new era, have such a mood? What do they lack? What are they pursuing?
    Of course, the reason for this cannot be found in personal lives, as one might speculate about Li Qingzhao's feelings. Generally speaking, these intellectuals have books to read, books to teach, and some even have excellent research environments. They also have a certain reputation and status in society. The times are not chaotic, and their lives can be adequately provided for. Why do they have such a decadent and declining mood? This can only be traced back to their class stand.
    The vast majority of bourgeois intellectuals entered the new era from the old era with a bourgeois worldview and outlook on life. However, in the new era, the socialist revolution has eliminated the economic foundation of the bourgeoisie, and every intellectual faces the solemn task of how to adapt to the new era. As Chairman Mao said, "If the skin is gone, what can the hair adhere to?" The situation is truly compelling. Many intellectuals understand this truth, recognize the situation, and are determined to transform themselves, abandon their bourgeois worldview, and serve the socialist economic base. However, there are some who have not yet recognized the necessity of transformation, or although they want to transform, their old worldview is too stubborn and cannot be driven away at once. Like "hair," they float in mid-air, losing the "skin" of the bourgeois economic base to which they can adhere. Thus, they "search and search," but search up and down without finding anything. Everywhere is the flame of socialist revolutionary struggle, which is incompatible with their own thoughts, naturally making them "bleak and desolate," and their mood "so sad, so tragic, so miserable."
    Perhaps some will say that some of them have held decadent feelings not just since today, but were like this even when the bourgeois economic base had not been eliminated. But this does not change the above argument. Because in the era in which they lived in the past, the bourgeoisie was already heading towards decline. The golden age of the bourgeoisie had long passed, and its economic base, the "skin," was already riddled with holes, making it difficult for the "hair" to adhere.
    Are they doomed to be decadent and depressed and unable to invigorate themselves? Why can't they abandon the futile effort of searching for the "skin" of the bourgeois economic base? Why can't they let themselves adhere to the new working-class "skin"?
    A distinction must be made. The intellectuals we are talking about do not refer to the "rightists" who are determined to be enemies of socialism. The rightists among bourgeois intellectuals are generally not simply decadent and depressed. They are not reconciled to the "skin being gone," and they strive for the revival of the old "skin." When they mistakenly believe that their "early spring weather" has arrived, they are invigorated and ready to go. The intellectuals we are talking about are not like this. They have recognized the death of the class they are attached to, but they do not have the courage to surrender to the emerging class, and therefore they cannot help but feel bewildered, helpless, decadent, and depressed.
    For them, the only way out is to surrender, to betray the already dead bourgeoisie, and to submit a surrender to the working class. In fact, they are already working in the new society and have formally surrendered to the working class. The problem is that they are "half-hearted" and do not regard building socialism as building their own home like workers and peasants do, nor do they regard the cause of the working class as their own. They do not put all their efforts into valiantly making contributions to the new society, retreating from the battle or not participating in it at all. But they have knowledge and learning, and some have very high learning. They have the ability to valiantly make contributions to the new society.
    Zhao Yun, Ma Chao, and Huang Zhong, three of the Five Tiger Generals of the Shu Han, were all surrendered generals. It is not necessarily disgraceful for surrendered generals to make contributions for their new lord. The question is whether to surrender to a righteous army or to treacherous villains. If bourgeois intellectuals sincerely surrender to the working class, truly regard the cause of the working class as their own, and summon up the courage to participate in the battle, they will also become heroic figures in socialist construction. Moreover, in this era of the great leap forward in socialist construction, as long as intellectuals truly have knowledge, even if they only have a special skill, they will have a place to use their talents and will not be buried. Zhao Yun was unable to achieve his ambitions while serving Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan, but after joining Liu Bei, he was reused and became one of the Five Tiger Generals. If intellectuals recall the past in old China when many specialists and scholars were "not appreciated" and unable to exert their strength, and then look at the phenomenon of unemployment among many intellectuals in capitalist countries today, can they still willingly be decadent in this vigorous era?
    If they continue to be decadent, of course, the result will only be their own downfall, and the vigorous atmosphere of the entire society will not be diminished by it. However, socialist construction is a nationwide endeavor, and we must organize the strength of the people of the whole country to invest in the battle. More strength will always bring more benefits to socialist construction. Moreover, the majority of them are in the position of teaching and educating people, and their decadent atmosphere will inevitably have an impact on the younger generation. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate this decadent atmosphere among intellectuals and allow the strength of all intellectuals to be invested in socialist construction. As for how to eliminate this decadent atmosphere, I believe that the current "double-anti" movement, big-character posters, great airing of views, great debates are the best methods. An old teacher at Peking University posted a big-character poster to another old professor with a very strong decadent atmosphere, called "Calling Back the Soul" of so-and-so. Chairman Mao said: "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is equivalent to having no soul." For those who are decadent and depressed, calling back the soul is very necessary. We must use big-character posters to call back their souls, use great airing of views and great debates to call back their souls, let the masses call back their souls for them, and let them call back their souls for themselves. In fact, many of them have begun to cheer up in this "double-anti" movement, making self-criticisms, setting plans, expressing their determination to transform themselves, and encouraging each other, striving to be enterprising. This is no longer a dead corner in the great leap forward of socialist construction. The ashes have been rekindled, and the spring is awakening. I believe that under the burning flames of the "double-anti" movement and the impact of the great leap forward in socialist construction, the decadent atmosphere among intellectuals can definitely be eliminated.

    清除知识分子中的颓废气氛
    鲁歌
    我们的时代真是一个不平凡的时代。打开报纸，满眼都是生产上的捷报和各方面工作跃进的喜讯，不论在工厂、在农村、在学校、在街道、在祖国的每一个角落，到处都洋溢着建设社会主义的热情，先进赶过先进，高潮接着高潮，全国人民都在鼓足干劲，力争上游，为建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
    然而，就在这样的日子里，却有一小部分知识分子抱着消极徬徨的态度，对蓬蓬勃勃的建设事业不感兴趣，对日新月异的新鲜事物缺乏感情，对如火如荼的革命斗争表示冷淡。他们或则埋头故纸堆中，两耳不闻窗外事；或则维持政治上的一般表现，安心做一个中间分子。据这次高等学校双反运动的揭发：有的老教师认为高级知识分子应该“宁静（少搞些政治运动）以致远（专心搞科学研究）”，有的老教师只要求做社会主义的“客卿”，甚至还有不少人抱着“灰色人生观”，认为“人生若梦”，“心中无大志，过了一天就去了两个半天”。有一位教授到钢铁厂参观，看到什么都不起劲，只看见大烟囱冒白烟，说“这真好看”，拍了一张照片就回来了。整个社会的形势是轰轰烈烈的，而他们的心情却像李清照声声慢词里所描写的：“寻寻觅觅，冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨戚戚”。
    李清照是一个封建时代、遭逢丧乱，不幸死了丈夫的女词人，“寻寻觅觅，冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨戚戚”，活画出一种寡妇心情。但是我们的这些知识分子，生在这个欣欣向荣、一日千里的新时代，为什么会产生这样一种心情呢？他们缺少什么？他们又追求什么呢？
    当然，这个原因，并不能像揣摩李清照心情那样在个人生活上去找寻。一般说，这部分知识分子有书读、有书教，有的人还有条件很好的研究环境，在社会上也有一定的声誉和地位，时代既非丧乱，生活尽可温饱。为什么他们会有这样颓废没落的心情呢？这就只有从他们的阶级立场来找根源了。
    资产阶级知识分子，他们中间的绝大部分都是带了资产阶级人生观和世界观从旧时代进入新时代来的。但是，在新时代里，社会主义革命已经消灭了资产阶级的经济基础，在每个知识分子面前都摆着如何使自己适应新时代的庄严课题。正如毛主席所说：“皮之不存，毛将焉附”。真个是形势逼人。许多知识分子都懂得这个道理，认清了形势，决心改造自己，抛弃自己的资产阶级世界观，为社会主义经济基础服务。但是，却有这么一部分人，他们还没有认识到改造的必要，或者虽然也想改造，但旧的世界观过于顽强，一下驱之不去。他们像“毛”一样飘在半空中，失去了可以依附的资产阶级经济基础之“皮”，于是“寻寻觅觅”，但上下求索而终无所得，到处是社会主义革命斗争的火焰，与自己的思想格格不入，自然就“冷冷清清”，心情也就“凄凄惨惨戚戚”了。
    也许有人说，他们中间的一些人，抱着颓废的心情并不是从今天开始的，他们在资产阶级经济基础没有消灭的时候就是这样的。但这也并不能改变上述的论证。因为在他们过去所生活的那个时代，已经是资产阶级走向没落的时代，资产阶级的黄金时代早已过去，它的经济基础之
  “皮”早已百孔千疮，“毛”也难于依附的了。
    难道他们就只有这样颓废、消沉而不能振作吗？为什么他们不能够放弃寻觅资产阶级经济基础之“皮”的徒劳无功的努力，为什么他们不能够让自己依附在新的工人阶级的“皮”上呢？
    必须分别，我们所说的这些知识分子，并不是指那些决心与社会主义为敌的“右派”。资产阶级知识分子中的右派，他们一般倒不是一味颓废、消沉的，他们不甘心于“皮之不存”，他们却力争旧“皮”之复活。当他们错误地估计以为他们的“早春天气”已经到来的时候，他们是振作精神以赴的。我们所说的这些知识分子并不是这样，他们已经认识到自己所依附的阶级之死亡，却又没有投降新兴阶级的勇气，因此就不免徬徨无依，颓废消沉了。
    对于他们来说，唯一的出路就是投降，就是背叛已经死亡了的资产阶级，向工人阶级递降表。实际上，他们已经在新社会做了工作，已经在形式上投降了工人阶级，问题是“半心半意”，没有像工人农民一样把建设社会主义当作建设自己的家园，把工人阶级的事业当作自己的事业，没有拿出浑身解数为新社会奋勇立功，在战斗中退缩或者根本不参加战斗。而他们有知识、有学问，有的还有很高的学问，他们是有本领为新社会奋勇立功的。
    蜀汉五虎将中赵云、马超、黄忠就都是降将。降将为新主立功，并不一定是不光彩。问题在于是降义师，还是降奸贼。资产阶级知识分子如果心悦诚服地投降了工人阶级，真正把工人阶级的事业当作自己的事业，鼓起勇气，参加战斗，一样会成为社会主义建设的英雄人物的。何况在这个社会主义建设大跃进的时代，知识分子只要真正有知识，即使只有一技之长，就会有用武之地，就不会埋没英才。赵云历事袁绍、公孙瓒都不能得志，直到投了刘备以后，才得到重用，成为五虎上将。知识分子如果回忆到在旧中国多少专长学者“怀才不遇”和有力量不能发挥作用的往事，再看看资本主义国家今天多少知识分子失业的现象，还能够在这个轰轰烈烈的时代自甘颓废吗？
    他们如果就此颓废下去，当然结果只有自己沉落，整个社会轰轰烈烈的气氛并不会因此而减色。但是社会主义建设是全民性的，我们要将全国人民的力量组织起来投入战斗，多一分力量对于社会主义建设总多一分好处。而且他们中的多数都处在为人师表的地位，他们的颓废气氛对于青年一代也就不无影响。因此，必须在知识分子中清除这一种颓废气氛，让所有知识分子的力量都投入社会主义建设中来。至于怎样才能清除这种颓废气氛，我以为目前“双反”运动、大字报、大鸣大放、大争大辩就是最好的办法。北京大学一位老教师给另一位颓废气味很浓的老教授贴了一张大字报，叫做给某某“招魂”。毛主席说：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。对于颓废消沉的人们，招魂是十分必要的。我们要用大字报来招他们的魂，用大鸣大放、大争大辩来招他们的魂，让群众来为他们招魂，让他们自己来给自己招魂。事实上，他们中的不少人在这次“双反”运动中已经开始振作起来，纷纷做检查，订规划，表示决心改造自己，并且相互激励，力求奋发。这里已经不再是社会主义建设大跃进的死角，残灰已经复燃，春意正在苏醒。我相信在“双反”运动的烈火燃烧下，在社会主义建设大跃进的浪潮冲击下，知识分子中的颓废气氛是一定可以清除的。
