Unifying Efforts to Fight Drought
Laibin County, Guangxi Creates New Working Methods to Combat Drought and Speed Up Planting by Onefold

    Nanning, April 29th (This newspaper) To adapt to the needs of large-scale drought resistance, rush planting and cultivation, the Laibin County Committee of the Communist Party of China created a new set of leadership and working methods—"Six Concentrations," "Four Links," and "Fixed Quotas"—overcoming the contradictions of water scarcity, time constraints, and insufficient manpower, materials, and animal power.
    "Six Concentrations" means concentrating manpower, concentrating drought resistance tools and agricultural implements, concentrating animal power, concentrating water power, concentrating leadership, and concentrating meals in the fields. "Four Links" means dividing the concentrated massive manpower and material resources into four task forces according to production needs: water-wheeling for drought resistance, plowing and harrowing fields, transporting and applying fertilizer, and transplanting seedlings, implementing assembly-line operations. "Fixed Quotas" means setting labor quotas for drought resistance and plowing according to water level and water consumption; setting transplanting quotas according to skill level and labor strength. This enables each task force to actively engage in production under the guidance of quotas. This set of working methods is interconnected and indispensable.
    Laibin County experienced a severe drought this spring. Only twenty-one of the three hundred and sixty-two newly built mountain ponds and reservoirs last winter and this spring had water. Most of the county's 530,000 mu of dry rice fields lacked water or had no water for transplanting. Since the drought resistance rush planting began in late March, the progress of transplanting had been very slow before April 15th, mainly due to the dispersion of labor and water use. On the one hand, townships and communes with water could not transplant on time due to insufficient labor; on the other hand, a large number of laborers in townships and communes without water were not utilized. In addition, there were thirty-six rivers and ponds of various sizes with water in the county, but they were not utilized. In response to the above situation, the Laibin County Party Committee successively proposed the working methods of "Six Concentrations," "Four Links," and "Fixed Quotas" before April 12th, mobilizing the people of all ethnic groups in the county to go all out, support each other, and resolutely complete the task of drought resistance and transplanting. This measure was supported by the people of the whole county, and the number of people participating in drought resistance and rush planting quickly increased from 120,000 to more than 250,000, concentrating more than 30,000 waterwheels, more than 45,000 water scoops, as well as a large number of water lifting tools and draught cattle. Many urban residents, students, handicraft workers, and small merchants also participated in the fight against drought. At the same time, the county selected more than 1,900 cadres, led by the county party secretaries themselves, and divided them into four work teams to go deep into the countryside, forming a huge, organized, and led labor army for drought resistance and rush planting throughout the county, fighting day and night. This labor army broke down the boundaries of townships and communes. Wherever there was water, they wheeled water to irrigate the fields and transplanted seedlings. For example, three cooperatives in Dawan Township, including twelve villages, had water only in three villages. The eleven villages in this township concentrated manpower, tools, and animal power to help the three villages carry out drought resistance and transplanting day and night. Ninety-two people from the Longshan Zhuang ethnic commune in Qingling Township brought their complete set of tools and animal power, and also brought the seedlings they had cultivated to support the Qingling Han ethnic commune. Therefore, not only did they overcome the difficulties of lacking manpower, animal power, and tools, but they also corrected the shortcomings of chaotic labor organization in the early stage of drought resistance, greatly accelerating the speed of drought resistance and rush planting. From February 26th to April 15th, the county transplanted only 130,000 mu in twenty-one days; after implementing the new leadership methods and working methods, even though drought resistance and rush planting became increasingly difficult, they rushed to transplant more than 110,000 mu in eight days, and the daily work efficiency was more than doubled compared with the past, and the quality was also better. So far, this labor army has drained more than 1,500 large and small ponds and small rivers. Now they are marching towards the Hongshui River, one of the famous rivers in Guangxi. Tens of thousands of people are camping along the Hongshui River, connecting dozens of waterwheels, from twelve to thirty-two, on the river bank, which is more than ten feet deep, to wheel water to irrigate the fields day and night.

    统一调动力量向干旱作斗争
    广西来宾县创造新的工作方法抗旱抢插速度提高一倍
    本报南宁29日电　适应大面积的抗旱抢耕抢插的需要，中共来宾县委创造了一套新的领导方法和工作方法——“六集中”、“四连环”、“一定额”，克服了水少、时间紧迫和人力、物力、畜力不足的矛盾。
    “六集中”就是人力集中，抗旱工具和农具集中，畜力集中，水力集中，领导力量集中，集中田间开饭。“四连环”，就是把集中了的庞大人力、物力按照生产的需要，分成车水抗旱、犁田耙田，运肥下田，拔秧插秧四个作业小组，实行流水作业。“一定额”，就是按照水位高低和耗水多少，订出抗旱犁田的劳动定额；按照技术高低、劳力强弱订出插秧定额。使各个作业小组在定额指导下积极地进行生产。这一套工作方法是相互联系的，缺一不行。
    来宾县今春发生了严重的干旱，去冬今春新修的三百六十二处山塘水库仅有二十一处有水，全县五十三万亩旱稻田大部缺水和无水插秧。自3月下旬抗旱插秧以来，到4月15日前，插秧进度十分缓慢，主要原因是劳动力分散，用水分散。一方面是有水的乡社因劳力不足，不能按时插秧；无水乡社大批劳动力没有发挥作用。另方面，全县有三十六处大小河流和水塘有水，但没有利用。根据上述情况，中共来宾县委在4月12日前，先后提出了“六集中”、“四连环”、“一定额”的工作方法，发动全县各族人民全力以赴，互相支援，坚决完成抗旱插秧任务。这一措施得到全县人民的拥护，参加抗旱抢插的人数很快由十二万增加到二十五万多人，集中了三万多架水车，四万五千多个戽斗，以及大量提水工具和耕牛。很多城镇居民、学生、手工业工人和小商贩也都参加了抗旱斗争。同时，全县抽调出一千九百多名干部，由各县委书记亲自挂帅，分成四个工作队深入农村，在全县范围内组成了一支庞大的有组织、有领导的抗旱抢插劳动大军，日夜奋战。这支劳动大军，打破了乡、社界，哪里有水，就在哪里车水灌田，就在哪里插秧。如大湾乡三个合作社包括十二个村，只有三家村有水，这个乡的十一个村便集中了人力、工具、畜力帮助三家村日夜抗旱插秧。青岭乡龙山僮族社九十二人带着全套工具和畜力，还把自己育好的秧苗也带去，支援青岭汉族社。因此，不仅克服了缺少人力、畜力和工具的困难，而且纠正了抗旱初期劳动组合混乱的缺点，大大加快了抗旱抢插的速度。全县从2月26日起，到4月15日止，二十一天才插秧十三万亩；推行了新的领导方法和工作方法后，虽然在抗旱抢插越来越困难的情况下，八天就抢插了十一万多亩，每天工作效率比过去提高一倍多，而且质量也较好。到目前为止，这支劳动大军已把大小水塘及小河流车干了一千五百多处。现在他们又向广西著名的大河之一红水河进军了。上万的人群在红水河沿岸安营扎寨，在深达十多丈的河岸上用十几到三十二辆水车连接起来，日夜车水灌田。
