Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 17th: Under the impetus of the Henan Provincial Party Committee's inspection and evaluation team, Xixian County, Henan Province, has strengthened wheat field management, and two-thirds of the county's Category Three wheat fields have been upgraded to Category One.

Recently, Shi Xiangsheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, led the Provincial Party Committee's inspection and evaluation team to inspect wheat field management in Wangxinzhuang Township, Xixian County. They found that the wheat seedlings in this township were growing well, and a bumper harvest was expected, but 16% of the wheat seedlings were still thin and yellow with many weeds. The main reasons were insufficient fertilization, incomplete weeding, damage to roots caused by excessively deep cultivation in some cases, and previous harm from red spiders. After the inspection, Shi Xiangsheng proposed that, under the current situation of overall great leap forward, the most central issue is to launch a massive wheat field management campaign to quickly transform Category Three wheat fields from thin to fertile and from yellow to green, to ensure a great wheat harvest.

Based on Shi Xiangsheng's instructions, the Xixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately organized an inspection and evaluation team of 100 to 200 people to conduct a general inspection, and adopted five emergency measures based on the current situation of wheat field management: First, vigorously apply quick-acting fertilizers, universally applying human urine, granular fertilizers, and wood ash once within five days to quickly eliminate Category Three wheat fields; Second, pull out all weeds within five days; Third, immediately prepare for frost prevention, while applying sufficient fertilizer and irrigating adequately, divide plots and assign them to households, prepare materials for smoke smudging, and immediately mobilize upon receiving a frost warning to ensure protection from frost damage; Fourth, quickly prepare 330,000 catties of pesticides, train technicians, and establish information stations in every commune, make all preparations to ensure the elimination of wheat midges; Fifth, secretaries take the lead, the whole party mobilizes, the whole people mobilize, race against time, seize grain from disasters, appraise plot by plot, assign responsibility by area, create examples, organize visits, study measures on the spot, and act immediately to strive to guarantee a per-mu wheat yield of 350 catties. After the implementation of these measures, significant results have been achieved in the past ten days. Of the county's more than 220,000 mu of Category Three wheat seedlings, 150,000 mu have been upgraded to Category One, and Category Two wheat has also undergone great changes.

    中共息县县委根据史向生的指示，立即组织一、二百人的检查评比团作了普遍检查，并根据当前麦田管理的情况采取了五项紧急措施：一、大力追施速效肥料，五日内普施一次人尿、颗粒肥料和草木灰，迅速消灭三类麦田；二、五日内拔净杂草；三、立即作好防霜的准备，在施足肥、灌足水的同时，划分地段包块到户，作好熏烟的物资准备，一遇霜冻警报，立即出动，保证不受霜冻危害；四、迅速准备好农药三十三万斤，训练好技术人员，社社建立情报站，作好一切准备，保证消灭吸浆虫；五、书记动手，全党动员，全民动员，与时间赛跑，与灾害夺粮，逐块鉴定，分片包干，作出样子，组织参观，就地研究措施，立即行动，为保证亩产小麦三百五十斤而奋斗。这一措施贯彻实施后，十日来取得显著的效果。全县二十二万多亩三类麦苗，已有十五万亩提高为一类，二类麦也起了很大变化。
