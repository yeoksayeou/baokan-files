    The Role of "Professional Practice" in Ideological Remolding
    Jia Hao
    Many intellectuals like to emphasize the characteristics of intellectuals. Some even believe that the path of ideological remolding for intellectuals lies mainly through professional practice. They cite Lenin's words to prove their point: "One must always remember that the engineer recognizes communist ideas through a path different from that of the propagandists and writers who used to work in secret conditions, but through the actual results he achieves in his own field of science." They also say: professional practice is one of the three paths for intellectuals' ideological remolding, as indicated by Premier Zhou in his report on the intellectuals issue. Therefore, they are not very interested in socio-political movements and are even more indifferent to integration with workers and peasants and labor training. This is a very bad phenomenon.
    In fact, regarding professional practice, Lenin only said that it is a path to "recognizing communist ideas"; Premier Zhou also only said that it is one of the paths to ideological remolding. This is completely correct. But they did not say that this is the fundamental path for intellectuals to become "both red and expert" working-class intellectuals, let alone the only standard for intellectuals' remolding. As for what constitutes a working-class intellectual, Chairman Mao already explained it in 1939. He said: "The final demarcation between revolutionary, non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and practice integration with the workers, peasants and soldiers." He also said: "I put forward a standard here, which I think is the only standard. … That is to see whether he is willing and practices integration with the broad masses of workers and peasants. Those who are willing and practice integration with workers and peasants are revolutionary, otherwise they are non-revolutionary, or even counter-revolutionary." The revolutionary intellectual pointed out by Chairman Mao is, in the current context, a working-class intellectual, or a socialist intellectual. Such revolutionary intellectuals were able to wield both pen and sword in the past revolutionary war period, and are now both red and expert in the socialist construction period. This is the specific goal of the current ideological remolding of intellectuals. Obviously, this goal cannot be achieved simply by acknowledging communist ideas, let alone by simply engaging in professional practice.
    Indeed, many intellectuals support the Communist Party and socialism not because of class consciousness or the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist worldview, but often because of social observation and professional practice. They see and experience in their actual lives that China has indeed stood up politically, economically, culturally, and in terms of national defense, and is continuing to leap forward. Under such circumstances, how can a Chinese person remain indifferent? It is only natural to feel happy in spirit, encouraged in thought, and motivated in work. The professional practice of intellectuals is part of the entire social undertaking. Therefore, it can be affirmed that professional practice will inevitably have a certain effect on the ideological remolding of intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals. However, we must have a correct assessment of this effect.
    What does professional practice refer to? If it refers to the work that intellectuals often do, then some professional activities have a greater impact on ideological training, such as mass struggles, grassroots work, and labor training, while others have a smaller impact, such as working in government agencies and teaching. However, if professional practice does not refer to these general tasks, but mainly refers to the scientific work engaged in by natural scientists, such as physicists and biologists, then what can these scientists gain from their scientific practice that has an effect on ideological remolding? I think we can analyze and study it from two aspects.
    First, if a natural scientist can truly discover and understand that the laws of material movement in his field of science conform to the theoretical principles of dialectical materialism, then he may first accept Marxist-Leninist ideas from a scientific perspective, and then theoretically understand that communist theory is a great scientific prediction and the communist movement is a social movement in accordance with objective laws. Therefore, he may not oppose this revolutionary movement and acknowledge it. Then, he gradually understands the various practical problems in the revolutionary movement from principle to specific, and improves his political understanding. This is the ideological evolution process of a scientific materialist viewpoint becoming a revolutionary political viewpoint, and it is also the process of a scientist influencing his political viewpoint starting from his field of science. However, the prerequisite for smoothly passing through this process is to seriously study Marxist-Leninist theory. If a scientist is unwilling or does not seriously study Marxism-Leninism, then he will have no way to understand dialectical materialism, and it will be impossible to establish his scientific viewpoint on the basis of a dialectical materialist philosophical viewpoint, and it will be even more impossible to understand the laws of social development of historical materialism. Therefore, without the enlightenment of Marxism, professional practice is difficult to independently exert a progressive effect on the ideology of scientists, and it is even more difficult to serve as the material basis of revolutionary thought. For example, in history, there have been many natural scientists who, although they have made certain achievements in the field of natural science, their scientific work has not enabled them to have progressive views on socio-political issues, let alone lead them to the revolutionary path of serving the working people. Some are still extremely backward, or even reactionary, in their political views. Only those scientists who have accepted Marxist ideas have truly achieved the unity of scientific and political viewpoints. They regard scientific viewpoints as the material basis of political viewpoints, and political viewpoints as the direction and soul of scientific viewpoints. Politics gives science its soul, and science serves politics.
    Second, those scientists who love the motherland, love science, and have a strong sense of career, have experienced difficult years for the cause of science in the old China and have suffered the hardships of society. Therefore, they not only have scientific knowledge, but also have rich life experience and the ability to distinguish between good and bad in society. They see that the victory of the people's revolution has brought development conditions to their scientific cause, their cause has been valued by the country and supported by the people, their ideals have been realized, and their expertise has been brought into play. As a result, they have received a profound education. From these situations they have seen and experienced firsthand, they have discovered the superiority of the socialist system, the close relationship between the revolutionary cause and social development and the development of science, and thus gradually understood that only socialism and communism can truly promote the development of science. Therefore, scientists may support the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party from the perspective of scientific undertaking.
    The socialist system is conducive to the development of scientific undertakings and to the true free development of scientists, but it must be noted that the socialist revolution and the socialist system conflict with the ideology that scientists brought from the old society. For example, their individualism, liberalism, and other various bourgeois viewpoints are in contradiction with the principle of collectivism. If we do not take appropriate measures to help them, then the little positive effect that professional practice may have is often swallowed up by these bourgeois ideologies. Therefore, it must be recognized that what influences the ideology of scientists is not only their scientific work, but also many other factors, such as personal history, class background, social relations, education, and the surrounding environment. In particular, what often plays a decisive role in one's political views and political attitudes is not their professional practice, but other factors. This often leads us to see some scientists who basically support socialism, but they are not open-minded and progressive enough, not active enough in socio-political movements, and express dissatisfaction with some social policies. Therefore, in order to enable scientific professional practice to have a positive effect on the ideological progress of scientists, scientists must recognize that with the development of society, they must seriously carry out self-revolutionary ideological remolding, remove all the bourgeois ideological viewpoints brought from the old society, and establish ideological viewpoints that meet the needs of socialism. Otherwise, the positive role of professional practice is difficult to occupy the ideological front. Therefore, in order to enable scientific professional practice to play a positive ideological role, in addition to seriously studying Marxism-Leninism, scientists must also come out of their archives and laboratories and actively participate in socio-political movements, so that they can transform their thinking, improve their understanding, boost their enthusiasm, and strive for progress in these movements. At the same time, they must also come to the people, even if it is just a fleeting glance, to the countryside, to the factories, to the grassroots and front lines of socialist construction to see the great and vivid situation, to exchange ideas with the workers and peasants, to feel the emotions of the working people, so as to enhance their courage and motivation to move forward.
    We cannot ignore the impact of professional practice on the thinking of scientists, but we cannot overestimate its role, especially we cannot isolate it. In addition, it should also be noted that some people raise the issue of professional practice in an attempt to explain that professional practice is the main path and law for intellectuals' ideological remolding and integration with workers and peasants. They believe that intellectuals master science and technology, socialist construction needs science and technology, and at the same time, in the current situation in China, science and technology can only serve socialism, and there is no other way out. Therefore, the objective situation makes it inevitable for intellectuals to integrate with workers and peasants, that is: integrated if they integrate, integrated if they do not integrate; willing to serve socialism if they serve, unwilling to serve if they serve. Therefore, there is no need for any more ideological remolding. As long as there is scientific and technological knowledge, there is everything - the role of professional practice is the greatest. This view is obviously wrong. It is the view that only professional work is needed, not politics, professional work is politics, and expertise is redness. Numerous facts have proved that only intellectuals who have undergone ideological remolding can withstand risks in the great storms of social revolution.

    “业务实践”对思想改造的作用
    贾皞
    不少知识分子喜欢强调知识分子的特点。有人甚至因此认为，知识分子思想改造的道路主要是通过业务实践。他们援引列宁这一句话来证明自己的观点：“要时刻记着一点，即工程师承认共产主义思想，所经历的途径并不像从前那些在秘密条件下工作的宣传员和著作家所经历的一样，而是经过他在自己那一门科学方面所达到的实际成果。”他们还说：业务实践是知识分子思想改造的三条道路之一，这是周总理在知识分子问题报告中所指示的。因此，他们对于社会政治运动不大感兴趣，对于同工农相结合和劳动锻炼更持冷漠态度。这是一种很不好的现象。
    其实，关于业务实践，列宁只是说，这是“承认共产主义思想”的途径；周总理也只是说，这是思想改造的途径之一。这是完全正确的。但是他们并没有说，这是知识分子达到“又红又专”的工人阶级知识分子的根本道路，更不是知识分子改造的唯一标准。关于什么是工人阶级知识分子的问题，毛主席早在1939年就已作过说明。他说：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”他又说：“我在这里提出了一个标准，我认为是唯一的标准。……这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”毛主席所指出的这个革命知识分子，在当前来说就是工人阶级知识分子，或者叫做社会主义知识分子。这种革命知识分子在过去革命战争时期是能文能武，而在现在社会主义建设时期就是又红又专。这就是目前知识分子思想改造的具体的目标。十分明显，这个目标决不是只承认共产主义思想就可以达到的，更不是只单纯通过业务实践就可以达到的。
    的确，有很多知识分子拥护共产党和社会主义，并不是由于阶级觉悟，或建立了马克思列宁主义的世界观，而常常是由于社会观察和业务实践。他们在实际生活中看到并体验到，中国确实在政治上、经济上、文化上和国防力量上都站起来了，并且正在继续飞跃前进。在这种时代的形势下，作为一个中国人怎样能无动于衷呢？精神上感到愉快，思想上受到鼓舞，工作上增加了动力，这是很自然的。知识分子的业务实践是整个社会事业的一部分，因此，可以肯定，业务实践对于知识分子、特别是高级知识分子的思想改造，必然发生一定的作用。但是对于这种作用，我们要有正确的估计。
    业务实践是指什么来说的呢？如果这是指知识分子经常所做的工作，那么有些业务对思想锻炼的作用较大，如群众斗争、基层工作、劳动锻炼等，而有些业务对思想锻炼的作用较小，如坐机关、当教师等。但是，如果业务实践并不是指这些一般性的工作，而主要是指那些自然科学家所从事的科学业务而言，如物理学家、生物学家等，那么这些科学家们能从自己的科学业务实践当中得到哪些对于思想改造发生作用的东西呢？我以为可以从两个方面加以分析研究。
    第一，一个自然科学家，如果能够真正发现和懂得了自己那一门科学领域的物质运动的规律是符合辩证唯物主义理论原则的，那末他就有可能首先在科学观点上接受马克思列宁主义思想，进而从理论上懂得共产主义理论是伟大的科学预见，共产主义运动是合乎客观规律的社会运动。因而，他就有可能不反对这一革命运动，并承认这一革命运动。然后，他就逐渐由原则到具体地理解革命运动中的各种实际问题，提高政治认识。这就是科学的唯物主义观点成为革命的政治观点的思想演进过程，也是一个科学家从他那一门科学出发影响到其政治观点的过程。但是，要顺利走过这个过程的先决条件是必须认真地学习马克思列宁主义理论。如果一个科学家并不愿意或不认真学习马克思列宁主义，那末他就无从理解辩证唯物主义，也就不可能把他的科学观点建立在辩证唯物主义的哲学观点的基础上，更不可能理解历史唯物主义的社会发展规律。因此，如果没有马克思主义给予启发，那末业务实践是难以单独对科学家的思想发挥进步作用的，是更难以作为革命思想的物质基础的。例如，在历史上有很多自然科学家，他们在自然科学领域虽然有一定的成就，但是他们的科学业务并没有使他们对于社会政治问题具有进步观点，更没有把他们带向为劳动人民服务的革命道路上来，有些在政治观点上还是极端落后，甚至是反动的。只有那些接受了马克思主义思想的科学家，才真正做到了科学观点和政治观点的一致。他们把科学观点作为政治观点的物质基础，把政治观点作为科学观点的方向和灵魂，政治给科学以灵魂，科学为政治来服务。
    第二，那些热爱祖国、热爱科学、事业心很重的科学家，在旧中国时代曾经为了科学事业经历过艰难的岁月，饱受过社会的风霜。因此，他们不仅有科学知识，而且有丰富的生活经验和鉴别社会好坏的眼光。他们看到，人民革命胜利给他们的科学事业带来了发展条件，他们的事业得到国家的重视、人民的支持，他们的理想得到实现，他们的专长得到发挥。于是，他们受到了深刻的教育。从这些亲眼见到和亲身经历的情况中，他们发现社会主义制度的优越性，发现革命事业和社会发展对于科学发展的密切关系，从而逐渐懂得只有社会主义和共产主义制度才能真正促进科学的发展。因此，科学家们就可能从科学事业的角度出发，来拥护社会主义制度和共产党的领导。
    社会主义制度有利于科学事业的发展，有利于科学家的真正的自由发展，但是，必须注意，社会主义革命和社会主义制度是同科学家从旧社会带来的意识形态相冲突的。例如，他们的个人主义、自由主义和其他各种资产阶级观点都是同集体主义原则相矛盾的，如果我们不采取适当的方式给他们以帮助，那末业务实践所可能发生的一点积极作用是常会被这些资产阶级的思想意识所吞没的。因此，必须认识，对科学家的思想发生影响的，不仅仅是他们的科学业务，而且还有其他很多的因素，如个人历史、阶级出身、社会关系、所受的教育和周围环境等。尤其是对于本人政治观点和政治态度起决定作用的，往往并不是他们的业务实践，而是其他因素。这就使我们经常看到有些科学家，他们是基本上拥护社会主义的，但是他们不够开朗和进步，对于社会政治运动不够积极，对于一些社会政策流露不满情绪。因此，要使科学业务实践对科学家的思想进步发生积极作用，那就要使科学家认识到这一点，即随着社会的发展认真地进行自我革命的思想改造，除掉一切从旧社会所带来的资产阶级的思想观点，树立合乎社会主义所需要的思想观点。否则，业务实践的积极作用是很难占领思想阵地的。因此，要使科学业务实践发挥积极的思想作用，科学家们除了必须认真地学习马克思列宁主义之外，还必须从自己的资料室和实验室走出来，积极地参加到社会政治运动中来，好让自己在这些运动中改造思想，提高认识，鼓起干劲，力求进步。同时，必须到人民群众中间来走走，哪怕是走马看花，到农村，到工厂，到社会主义建设的最基层和最前哨去看看伟大而生动的局面，同工农群众交流思想，感受劳动人民的情感，以增强前进的勇气和动力。
    我们不能忽视业务实践对于科学家思想所发生的影响作用，但是也不能过高地估计了它的作用，特别是不能把它孤立起来。此外，还应该注意的是，有的人提出业务实践问题，是企图说明业务实践是知识分子思想改造并和工农相结合的主要道路和规律。他们认为，知识分子掌握科学技术，社会主义建设需要科学技术，同时，在目前中国的情况下科学技术只能为社会主义服务，别无出路。因此，客观形势就使知识分子必然同工农相结合，即：结合也结合了，不结合也结合了；愿意为社会主义服务也服务了，不愿意服务也服务了。因此，用不着再作什么思想改造，只要有了科学技术知识就什么也有了，——业务实践的作用最大。这种观点很显然是错误的，就是那种只要业务不要政治、业务就是政治、专就是红的观点。无数的事实证明，只有经过思想改造的知识分子，在社会革命的大风浪里才是经得起风险的。
