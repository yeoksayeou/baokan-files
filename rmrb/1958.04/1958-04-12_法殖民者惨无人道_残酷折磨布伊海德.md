Xinhua News Agency, London, April 11th. According to TASS, London, April 9th: The British Labour Party's "Tribune" published a commentary entitled "Djamila is in Danger Again," condemning the French colonial authorities' abuse of the Algerian patriotic young woman Djamila Bouhired. The commentary asked, did Djamila avoid death by the guillotine only to die slowly?

"Tribune" said that two days after Djamila Bouhired was pardoned from the death penalty, the French colonial authorities transferred her from Algiers City Prison to Barberousse Prison, which is located in a tropical area on the edge of the Sahara Desert. The authorities admitted that Djamila was ill in prison and could not be treated, but refused to send her to the hospital.

The weekly wrote that Djamila's wounds are now inflamed, and one of her hands is paralyzed. Prison authorities do not allow Djamila's lawyer to visit her, and her friends cannot get reliable news about her.

    法殖民者惨无人道
    残酷折磨布伊海德
    新华社11日讯据塔斯社伦敦9日讯：英国工党的“论坛周刊”发表了一篇题为“贾米拉又处在危险中”的评论，谴责法国殖民当局对阿尔及利亚爱国女青年贾米拉·布伊海德的虐待。评论问道，难道贾米拉避免了断头台的死亡，是为了要慢慢地死去吗？
    “论坛周刊”说，法国殖民当局在贾米拉·布伊海德被赦免死刑两天以后就从阿尔及尔市监狱被移解到巴贝鲁斯监狱，这个监狱位于撒哈拉大沙漠边缘的热带地区。当局承认贾米拉在监狱中有病不能得到医治，却不把她送到医院里去。
    周刊写道，贾米拉现在伤口发炎，一只手已经瘫痪。监狱当局不允许贾米拉的律师去探望，她的朋友得不到关于她的可靠消息。
