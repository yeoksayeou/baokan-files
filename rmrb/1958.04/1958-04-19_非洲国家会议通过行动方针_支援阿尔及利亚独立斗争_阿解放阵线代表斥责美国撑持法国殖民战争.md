Xinhua News Agency, Accra, April 17th: A news communique issued on the afternoon of the 17th stated that the African Nations Conference had reached an agreement on an action plan to support Algeria in its struggle for independence at its plenary session this morning. The conference also instructed the Political Committee to draft a resolution for discussion by the plenary session.

The conference heard a speech by Yazid, representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, who called on participating countries to strengthen their moral, material, and diplomatic support for Algeria's struggle for independence.

At a press conference held after the meeting, Yazid accused the United States of bearing partial responsibility for the Algerian war, saying that France would not be able to continue the war if the United States had not recently granted France a $65 million loan, a point even the French Minister of Defense admitted. He also said that the United States has been supplying weapons to the French and supporting them at international conferences.

President Momie of the Cameroonian People's Union also elaborated on the Cameroonian issue at the meeting this morning. It is reported that Dr. Momie made the following three requests at the meeting: 1. That participating countries adopt a common stance in the United Nations and other international forums to realize Cameroon's legitimate rights; 2. That the United Nations immediately resolve the Cameroonian issue in accordance with the Charter and Cameroon's aspirations for unity and independence; 3. Declare full support for the Cameroonian struggle and condemn the bloody repression in the Cameroonian trust territory.

The Secretary-General of the conference said at a press conference that the conference's original agenda could proceed rapidly since the Algerian and Cameroonian issues had been discussed. The discussion of the first item on the agenda (which also involves the issue of racial discrimination and the future of other dependent countries) is expected to conclude on the 18th.

He revealed that the youth organization of French Togoland had also applied to speak at the meeting. The representative of Senegal also made the same request. This Togolese youth organization advocates for the immediate independence of French Togoland.

He said that all issues would be discussed at the plenary session, and the three committees would act as drafting committees. So far, the Political Committee has been meeting to discuss the draft resolution on the Algerian issue.

Accra newspapers today published congratulatory telegrams from Chairman Voroshilov and Premier Zhou Enlai to the African Nations Conference.
