    A Certain Engineering College Manufactures Tractor
    Xinhua News Agency, 20th — The teachers, students and workers of a certain engineering college of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army have successfully trial-produced the first "Songhua River No. 8" tractor after twenty days of hard work.
    After inspection and appraisal, the quality of this tractor is good. Its advantages are: it uses local coal and charcoal as fuel, which is very economical; it starts with a magneto; it can not only cultivate and harrow the land, but also drive generators and water pumps to generate electricity and pump water; the machine is light and easy to operate; the cost is low and the price is cheap.
    In order to integrate teaching with production, this engineering college plans to collectively produce 121 products. Trial-producing tractors is only one of them. During the trial production of this tractor, many teachers and students moved their luggage to the factory and lived and ate with the workers.

    新华社20日讯　中国人民解放军某工程学院师生和工人们，经过二十天苦战，已经试制成功第一台“松花江八号”拖拉机。
    这台拖拉机经过检查鉴定，质量良好，它的优点是：用土煤和木炭作燃料，很经济；用磁电机起动；不仅可以耕地、耙地，也可以作为动力带动发电机、抽水机发电、抽水；机器轻便，操纵容易；成本低，价格便宜。
    这所工程学院为使教学与生产相结合，共计划集体生产一百二十一项产品。试制拖拉机仅是其中的一项，在试制这台拖拉机的过程中，许多师生把行李搬到工厂里，和工人同吃同住。
