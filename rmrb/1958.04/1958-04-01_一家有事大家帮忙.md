One Family Has Trouble, Everyone Helps
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

Workers on all fronts in our country are launching an unprecedented socialist emulation movement. Stories of forgetting to eat and sleep, and racking one's brains to improve production and innovate technology, can be heard and seen everywhere. This is a manifestation of a vigorous revolutionary spirit. However, people are not made of iron after all, and they still need to eat and rest. Therefore, how well the family life of workers is arranged is closely related to whether they can quickly recover from fatigue after intense labor and to ensuring that they have enough energy to contribute to the Great Leap Forward. Today, this newspaper publishes the Gao Fengqin Family Mutual Aid Group, which uses mutual aid and cooperation to ensure workers' production and solve the problems of family members' study, production, and welfare. This approach is worth vigorously promoting throughout the country.

Organizing mutual aid and cooperation among workers' families, where everyone helps when one family has trouble, has many benefits. For example, daily life at home, such as buying rice, buying vegetables, dismantling and washing, and sewing and mending, takes up a lot of time. With the establishment of family mutual aid groups, workers' families can unite and live in harmony. At the same time, each family member has their own expertise, and many things can be done collaboratively. Family members can do their best and use their expertise. This can not only save a lot of labor but also manage the family in an orderly manner. It can also organize a portion of the labor force to engage in some service-oriented sideline production. Last year alone, the Gao Fengqin Family Mutual Aid Group helped workers with household chores for 4,925 days, reducing worker absenteeism by more than 4,900 workdays. Please see how much this contributes to ensuring production.

After being organized, in addition to taking care of household chores and participating in sideline production, family members can also arrange a certain amount of time to participate in social work and cultural and political studies, so as to improve their political awareness, broaden their horizons, and consider and care more about the collective cause.

Mutual aid and cooperation are also of great benefit in solving welfare problems. Many family members have rich experience in educating and raising children. With everyone's mutual aid and cooperation, these family members can run nurseries. This not only saves the state money, but also reduces the burden on family members, and the children can be educated. It truly kills many birds with one stone and is of great benefit to both the factory and the workers.

Organizing mutual aid and mutual assistance among workers' families is entirely voluntary and without any exchange conditions. This relationship is a new relationship between people in socialist society, and it is essentially different from the relationship between people in class society. In class society, in the eyes of the exploiting class, the relationship between people is a relationship of interest. Helping others without compensation is inconceivable. In class society, workers suffer from cruel exploitation. Although they also have the desire for mutual assistance, they do not have the ability or the possibility to do so. This is the abnormal relationship between people in class society. In socialist society, the relations of production have changed, and the interests of the state and the collective include the interests of everyone. Without the interests of the state and the collective, there would be nothing for the individual. Our country is a socialist country with public ownership of the means of production. The relationship between people has also changed with the change of the social system. This relationship is no longer a relationship of only caring about oneself and not caring about others, but a relationship of unity and mutual assistance in common labor, respecting and helping each other, and everyone working for everyone and everyone working for me. The mutual aid and cooperation of workers' families embodies this socialist relationship between people.

There are now more than 20 million workers in the country, and their families number no less than tens of millions. Workers' families are a part of the working class and also a rear force on the socialist production front. In the past few years, workers' families across the country have contributed to and contributed to the socialist transformation and socialist construction of the motherland. Hundreds of thousands of activists have emerged in the work of workers' families across the country. They are an indispensable and non-negligible important force in the socialist construction of the motherland. They and their loved ones jointly shoulder the glorious task of building socialism. In the future, if we can better organize this force, organize every worker's family, and give full play to the enthusiasm of workers' families, it will be of great benefit to socialist construction. The model example of the Gao Fengqin Family Mutual Aid Group should not only be widely promoted among the vast number of workers' families across the country, but also among the families of employees in government offices.

At a time when the whole country is comparing with the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and making great strides forward, family work should also make a Great Leap Forward, so that the vast number of workers' families, under the leadership of the Party and the trade unions, can actively organize and better serve the Great Leap Forward in socialist production.

    一家有事大家帮忙
    本报评论员
    我国各个战线上的职工，正在掀起一场前所未有的社会主义竞赛运动。废寝忘食、绞尽脑汁来提高生产革新技术的事例，到处可闻可见。这是一种旺盛的革命精神的表现。可是人终究不是铁打的，他还是需要吃饭、休息。因此，职工家庭生活安排得好坏，对职工们在紧张的劳动以后迅速恢复疲劳，对保证他们有充沛的精力来为大跃进贡献出一分力量就有着密切的关系。今天本报发表的高凤琴家属互助组，她们采用互助合作的办法，既保证了职工生产，又解决了家属学习、生产和福利问题。这种做法，值得在全国各地大大提倡。
    在职工家属中组织互助合作，一家有事大家帮忙，这种办法的好处很多。譬如居家过日子，买米、买菜、拆洗、缝补都要占去不少时间，组织了家属互助组，职工家属能够团结和睦相处，同时每个家属都有各人的专长，很多事情都能互相协作，家属们可以各尽所能，发挥各人的专长。这样不仅可以节省很大一部分劳动力，还可以把家庭料理得有条有理，还能够组织一部分劳动力来从事一些服务性的副业生产。高凤琴家属互助组去年一年就帮助职工们料理家务事四千九百二十五天，使职工少缺勤四千九百多个工作日。请看，这对保证生产起着多么大的作用。
    组织起来后，家属们除了办好家务事和参加副业生产外，还可以安排一定的时间来参加社会工作参加文化和政治学习，使家属的政治觉悟提高，目光远大，多考虑关心集体的事业。
    互助合作对解决福利问题也有很大的好处。许多家属有教育孩子、抚养孩子的丰富经验，大家互助协作，就可以由这些家属来办托儿所。这样做既不需要国家付出费用、又减少家属受孩子牵累，而孩子又能受到教育，真是一举数得，无论对工厂和职工都有很大益处。
    在职工家属之间组织互助互济，是完全出于自觉自愿、没有什么交换条件的。这种关系，是社会主义社会中人和人的新关系，它和阶级社会里人和人之间的关系有着本质的不同。在阶级社会里，在剥削阶级看来，人与人的关系，就是利害关系，帮人作事而没有代价，是不可设想的。在阶级社会里，工人们遭受着残酷的剥削，虽然也有互助的愿望，但是他们没有能力也不可能做到。这是阶级社会里人和人的不正常关系。在社会主义社会里，生产关系改变了，国家和集体的利益，就包括着每个人的利益。没有国家、集体的利益，就没有个人的一切。我们的国家，是生产资料公有制的社会主义国家。人和人之间的关系也跟着社会制度的改变而改变了，这种关系就不是只顾自己不顾别人的关系，而是在共同劳动中互相尊重、互相帮助，我为人人、人人为我的团结互助关系。职工家属的互助合作，正是体现了这种社会主义的人与人之间的关系。
    现在全国有二千多万职工，他们的家属也不下数千万。职工家属是工人阶级的一部分，也是社会主义生产战线上的一支后方部队。几年来，全国职工家属对祖国社会主义改造和社会主义建设是出了力的，有贡献的。在全国职工家属工作中涌现了几十万积极分子。她们是祖国社会主义建设事业中所不可少的、不可忽视的一支重要力量。她们和自己的亲人共同担负起建设社会主义的光荣任务。今后，如果我们能够更好地组织这一批力量，把每一个职工家属都组织起来，发挥职工家属的积极性，对社会主义建设将有极大好处。高凤琴家属互助组的模范事例不仅要在全国广大工人家属中普遍提倡，在机关职工家属中也应提倡。
    在全国都在比先进、赶先进大踏步前进的时刻里，家属工作也应该来一个大跃进，让广大职工家属在党和工会的领导下，积极组织起来，更好地为社会主义生产大跃进服务。
