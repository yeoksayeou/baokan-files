Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th - The following is the full text of the speech given by Wang Wenting, a representative of the families of compatriots kidnapped to Japan, at the Tianjin Municipal Conference welcoming compatriot Liu Lianren:

	I am a family member of a Chinese citizen who, like Liu Lianren, suffered from the enslavement of Japanese militarism and whose whereabouts remain unknown to this day. Today is the day that compatriot Liu Lianren has been reborn from the brink of death, returned to the motherland, and seen the light of day again. I am extremely happy. I would like to extend a warm welcome and condolences to Liu Lianren.

	Ever since the People's Daily first published news of Liu Lianren, it has been stirring my heart. Not a day goes by that I don't look for news about Liu Lianren in the newspaper. Today, he has finally broken through fourteen years of darkness and escaped the miserable life of living in caves in the mountains, "drinking blood and eating fur."

	However, seeing compatriot Liu Lianren inevitably brings to mind the tragic scene of my family fourteen years ago, and reminds me of my loving father and my kind uncle. My father's name was Wang Fenggang, and my uncle's name was Wu Baoji. Like Liu Lianren, they were both honest and simple farmers. They toiled in the fields year-round, rain or shine, supporting my entire family with their blood and sweat. However, in the winter of 1943, the army of Japanese aggressors inhumanely kidnapped my father and my uncle from Yuanshi County, Hebei Province. My father and my uncle suffered beatings and torture in the prisons of the Japanese aggressors, and were then sent to Japan for forced labor. Their whereabouts are still unknown to this day. They may have already been brutally murdered, or they may still be stranded in Japan like Liu Lianren. The suffering and torture endured by my father and my uncle cannot be fully expressed in words, but the tragedy of my family is even more cruel. My grandfather was old and weak, unable to support the family. His eyes were blinded by anger. He suffered from a mental breakdown, wandered day and night, running east and west on the streets, shouting my father's name with his arms outstretched, bumping into everything. He soon died of illness. My gray-haired grandmother, missing her son on the one hand and with no one to support her on the other, suffered from hunger and cold, and also died of illness. My aunt could not afford clothes and was unable to withstand the cold. Helpless, she remarried with her daughter in her arms. At that time, I was still a teenager, and everyone can imagine my painful situation. The Japanese aggressors persecuted my family, causing separation, dispersal, and death. I will never forget this blood debt. I demand that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government be responsible for disclosing the whereabouts of my father and uncle and compensating my family for the losses we have suffered.

	The misfortune of my family is just one of the thousands of victimized families. There are many more families in China who have suffered similar persecution. The Japanese government can absolutely not deny these irrefutable facts. Kishi Nobusuke, the current Prime Minister of the Japanese government, who was a member of the Japanese government cabinet that invaded our country at the time, cannot deny this fact even more. Liu Lianren is even stronger evidence. Therefore, I believe that the Kishi Nobusuke government must bear full responsibility for the Liu Lianren incident, compensate Liu Lianren for all his losses, and at the same time, the Japanese government must conduct a thorough investigation into all the Chinese compatriots who were illegally kidnapped by the Japanese army during the Japanese invasion of China, including those who died and whose whereabouts are unknown in Japan, and be responsible for providing specific information on the results of the investigation. This is the unanimous demand of all the families of the victims and the entire Chinese people.

	The Japanese people truly harbor a deep friendship for this incident. They have taken good care of compatriot Liu Lianren, and before the Liu Lianren incident, they actively investigated the remains of compatriots who were kidnapped to Japan and sent back many remains. This friendly fact has deeply moved me. In the future, I am willing to work to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Japan.

    日政府要赔偿我家的损失
    交代我父亲和舅舅的下落
    被掳到日本去的难胞家属王文庭的讲话
    新华社天津16日电　被掳到日本去的难胞的家属代表王文庭在天津各界欢迎难胞刘连仁大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    我是一个和刘连仁同样遭受日本军国主义奴役而且到今天还下落不明的中国老百姓的家属。今天是难胞刘连仁死里再生重返祖国重见光明的日子，我感到万分的高兴。我要向刘连仁表示热烈的欢迎和慰问。
    自从人民日报上第一次发表了刘连仁的消息后，它就一直激动着我的心。我没有一天不在报纸上找寻刘连仁的消息。他今天总算是闯过了十四年的黑暗天日，摆脱了穴居山野“茹毛饮血”的悲惨生活。
    但是，一看到了刘连仁难胞不由得又想起了我十四年前的家庭惨景，想起了我慈爱的父亲和我善良的舅舅。我的父亲名叫王凤岗，我的舅舅名叫吴宝吉，他们也和刘连仁一样，是两个忠厚朴实的农民。他们一年四季风雨不停地在田里劳动，用血汗养活着我全家老幼，然而日本侵略者的军队却在1943年冬天不人道地把我的父亲和我的舅舅从河北省元氏县掳走了。我的父亲和我的舅舅在日本侵略者的监狱中受尽了毒打和折磨，然后被送到日本强迫奴役劳动，直到现在还下落不明，可能早已被残杀了，也可能还像刘连仁一样流落在日本。我父亲和我舅舅所受的苦难折磨，不是千言万语所能说得完的，但是更加残酷的悲剧还是我的家庭。我的祖父年老无力，难以养家，把眼睛也气瞎了，他神经失常，昼夜不归，在大街上东跑西奔，张开两手喊着我父亲的名字，到处乱撞，不久就病死了。我的白发苍苍的祖母一方面想儿子，一方面没有人养活，饥寒交迫，也随着得病死了。我的舅母穿不起衣服，寒冷难挡，无可奈何，怀抱女儿改嫁。这时我还是一个十几岁的小孩，我的痛苦处境大家都能想像得到。日本侵略者把我全家迫害得妻离子散，家破人亡，这笔血海深仇是我永远忘不了的。我要求日本岸信介政府负责交代我父亲和舅舅的下落，赔偿我家所遭受的损失。
    我的家庭的不幸遭遇只不过是千千万万个被害家庭中的一个，在中国像我这样惨遭迫害的家庭还多得很，日本政府绝对抵赖不了这些铁证如山的事实。作为当时侵略我国的日本政府内阁成员之一的现任日本政府首相岸信介，更抵赖不了这件事实。刘连仁更是一个铁证。因此，我认为岸信介政府必须承担刘连仁事件的全部责任，赔偿刘连仁的一切损失，同时日本政府必须把日本侵略中国时被日军非法掳走的所有中国难胞，包括在日本死去的和下落不明的进行彻底调查，负责将调查结果作出具体交代。这是全体受难者家属和全体中国人民的一致要求。
    日本人民对这一事件确怀着深厚的友谊，对刘连仁难胞照顾得很周到，并且在刘连仁事件以前对于被掳到日本去的难胞遗骨进行了积极的调查，送回了许多遗骨，这一友好事实使我很受感动。我今后愿为增进中日两国人民之间的友谊而努力。
