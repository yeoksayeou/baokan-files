Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: According to TASS, Pospelov, Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, delivered a report at the commemorative meeting on the 88th anniversary of Lenin's birth held in Moscow on the 22nd. The title of the report was: "Leninism is the Invincible Banner for the Struggle for the Victory of Communism."

Pospelov began by saying that today the Soviet people and the working people of the world are commemorating the 88th anniversary of the birth of V.I. Lenin, the genius of the revolution, the great teacher and friend of the working people. Lenin wisely saw the road of revolution, made a scientific, Marxist analysis of the comparison of class forces and the characteristics of each historical moment, and determined the party's strategy and tactics. Lenin foresaw the direction that the awakened people should take in their revolutionary struggle, and foresaw the future destiny of mankind.

Lenin adopted an irreconcilable attitude towards opportunism, revisionists, those who departed from the principles of Marxism, and those who departed from the class, proletarian viewpoints and policies. Lenin's theory of socialist revolution and building a socialist society has achieved extremely great victories. Today, Marxist-Leninist ideas have been grasped by hundreds of millions of people and have become a great material force, a great driving force of history. The attempts by the defenders and lackeys of dying capitalism to undermine or even weaken the growing influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas are futile.

The first part of Pospelov's report discussed the victory of Lenin's theory of socialist revolution and the building of communism.

Pospelov pointed out that Marx discovered the economic laws of the emergence, development, and demise of capitalist society, and pointed out the great historical mission of the proletariat as the gravedigger of capitalism. Lenin revealed the laws of the development and demise of capitalism in its final stage, namely the stage of imperialism. Lenin pointed out that at this highest stage of capitalist development, the material and technical preconditions for the transition to socialist society are objectively prepared. At the same time, imperialism means the frantic waste and destruction of productive forces, and means the death of millions of people in wars, which are caused by the imperialist social system, by the monopoly capital's pursuit of maximum profits, and by the pursuit of world hegemony.

Lenin discovered the law of uneven economic and political development of capitalism in the era of imperialism. Due to this law, some capitalist countries develop faster than others; the frantic competition among various monopoly capital groups is intensifying; the desire to re-divide the world is constantly generated, and thus imperialist wars break out. The objective results of the First and Second World Wars were to weaken the overall front of the world imperialist system, sharpen the internal contradictions of imperialism, and create the possibility of breaking through the imperialist front at its weakest link. Due to the weakening of imperialism, socialism is possible to win first in a few countries or even in a single country. In 1917, Russia was the weakest link in the imperialist system. The victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution is a clear proof of Lenin's theory of socialist revolution.

Pospelov said that Russia was the weakest link in the chain of world imperialism. However, Russia was also the strongest link in the world front of the revolutionary proletariat. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, the center of the revolutionary movement had shifted to Russia. In Western Europe, reformism prevailed in the workers' movement, thus the workers' movement was weakened ideologically and disarmed politically.

In the period of preparation and implementation of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Lenin's party merged various revolutionary movements: the proletarian socialist movement to establish Soviet power, the general democratic movement for peace and against imperialism, the peasant revolutionary democratic movement demanding land, and the national liberation movement of all nationalities in Russia into a unified and powerful revolutionary torrent. The merging of these different movements into a unified and huge revolutionary torrent quickly determined the fate of Russian capitalism.

The Great October Socialist Revolution in October 1917 was the revolution with the least bloodshed in its initial months, which shows the strength of the proletarian revolution and the great humanitarianism of the proletariat.

Pospelov said that in the early years of the Soviet regime, the Soviet Union had to overcome the enormous difficulties arising from the struggle against the destruction caused by the imperialist war and armed intervention, which were widely used by the servants and defenders of capitalism, and all kinds of reformists and revisionists.

After the end of the First World War, the situation of European capitalism was extremely unstable. Powerful revolutionary movements took place in Hungary, Germany, Poland, and other countries. But reformists and revisionists did everything possible to save the sinking capitalist ship. The right-wing Social Democrats in Germany directly colluded with Wilhelm's officers and generals to help suppress the German revolution. The reformists used the "price of revolution" to scare the Western European proletariat, and they proved that capitalism could be "improved" and that socialism could be entered by means of the peaceful evolution of capitalism. They maliciously took advantage of the difficulties and economic destruction of the heroic struggle of the Russian workers and peasants; they deliberately did not mention that all these difficulties were primarily the result of war and foreign intervention, rather than the result of revolution.

But history has proved that the "price" of preserving capitalism is much greater than the difficulties of the proletarian revolution that the revisionists who revised Marxism and all kinds of reformist lackeys of capitalism scared the working class with. Imperialism not only did not "democratize" capitalism, but produced a bloody and appalling offspring like fascism.

Pospelov said that the Second World War, like the First World War, was also caused by the contradictions of the imperialist world system. At that time, German fascism almost enslaved the entire European continent, causing unimaginable poverty and suffering to the people of Europe. Only the great strength and heroism of the socialist countries, and our party's wise and far-sighted Leninist policy, saved mankind from the threat of complete enslavement by fascism.

The Soviet people suffered serious sacrifices and losses in the Great Patriotic War. Any capitalist country, after suffering such serious losses, would not be able to recover its vitality within decades. Only the Soviet Union, due to the superiority of the socialist social system, due to the planned economic system, and due to the working people's keen interest in the high tide of the national economy, not only restored everything that was destroyed, but far exceeded the pre-war level. The enemies of socialism hoped to hinder the development of the Soviet Union towards communism for a long time, and hoped that the attractiveness of socialist and communist ideas would be weakened as a result. This calculation went bankrupt. Today, it is probably impossible to find any economist or politician in the bourgeois countries who would deny the great achievements made by the first socialist country in the world in the forty years since its establishment. The miraculous power of the socialist social system has been shown to the whole world.

Pospelov said that the Soviet Union is smoothly solving the basic economic task: catching up with and surpassing the most economically developed countries in terms of per capita output. The Soviet Union is able to accomplish this task, which is no longer doubted by many famous people in the capitalist world. They are only arguing about the timing: some say that it may be reached in twenty to twenty-five years, while others believe that the Soviet Union can even reach it in the early 1970s, that is, in twelve to fifteen years.

Pospelov pointed out that the data in the recently published United Nations statistical yearbook on the economic development speed of the Soviet Union and capitalist countries is noteworthy. In the four years from 1953 to 1956, capitalist industrial production increased by 16%, while Soviet production increased by 41%, but US production increased by only 7% in these years.

Now the United States has entered a stage of economic crisis, and the production level of many industrial sectors is declining sharply, and the number of unemployed people exceeds six million. The Soviet Union is now in a period of economic prosperity, and all sectors of the economy are thriving. This is not only an increase in output, but also a great leap forward in industry, agriculture, transportation, the entire economy and culture, the adoption of new technologies, the exploitation of new resources and potentials, and new qualitative changes in the development of Soviet society.

The second part of Pospelov's report discussed that the basic content of our time is the transition from capitalism to socialism.

Pospelov said that the basic content of our time is the transition from capitalism to socialism, which was initiated by the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia. Under the influence of the ideas of the October Revolution, under the influence of the great example of the first socialist country in the world, due to the collapse of fascism and the great upsurge of the national liberation movement, and due to the transformation of the large-scale anti-fascist democratic movement into the socialist movement, the face of the world has fundamentally changed.

The declaration of the conference of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries held in November 1957 correctly pointed out: "Now, more than 950 million people, accounting for more than one-third of the world's population, have embarked on the road of socialism and are building a new life. The great development of socialist forces has encouraged the great development of the anti-imperialist national movement after the war. In the past twelve years, in addition to the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, more than 700 million people have broken free from the colonial shackles and established their own national sovereign states. The people of the colonies and semi-colonies that are still enslaved are strengthening their struggle for national liberation. The development of socialism and the national liberation movement has drastically accelerated the process of imperialism's decline. Imperialism has lost its original control over most of mankind."

Pospelov said that even in the imperialist countries with a population of about 500 million, a considerable part of the working people are breaking free from the influence of imperialism, increasingly resolutely resisting the policies of imperialism and monopoly capital, and fighting for better living conditions, democratic rights, peace, and socialism.

Pospelov said that the contradictions between capitalist countries are deepening. Under the banner of "anti-communism," the US imperialist aggressive bloc is trying to dominate most countries in the world, trying to push its capitalist partners and competitors out of the positions they occupy. At the same time, some aggressive groups in the United States are trying to unite all the reactionary forces in the capitalist world around themselves, and are constantly carrying out hostile subversive activities against socialist countries. The world's reactionary forces are rearming former Hitler generals, this time with the most dangerous atomic weapons. It seems that the lessons of the Second World War have not been learned.

Pospelov asked, who should be held responsible for the escalation of international tensions? Where does the danger of war come from?

There is now a self-serving and inhumane force that greedily seeks high profits, that is obsessed with war, and that, in the vivid words of American newspapers, "fears peace." This is monopoly capital, primarily American monopoly capital. They shamelessly accuse the Soviet Union of aggressive intentions and describe our diplomacy as peace propaganda. In fact, it is they who hate peace.

People often yearn for peace and the greatest happiness, and people pray for world peace. The thinkers of modern imperialism, however, believe that war is the best way to consume and the greatest happiness. This is no longer the spiritual poverty of modern capitalism, but a complete moral degradation.

Pospelov emphasized that socialist countries do not need war. They only need peace to fully develop their economies and transition to communism. The strength of socialism in the world has grown enough to prevent war.

Pospelov then said that due to the growth of socialist and democratic forces, the strengthening of the national liberation movement, and the change in the face of the world, the issue of the concept of capitalist encirclement should also be raised from a new perspective.

As Comrade Khrushchev pointed out in his speech, it is now incorrect to talk about capitalist encirclement, because the strength of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, the entire socialist system, has grown to such an extent that it is now impossible to encircle them and place them in the state of encirclement that the Soviet Union was in for decades. However, as long as imperialism exists, the foundation for aggressive war exists, and the danger of imperialism invading socialist countries exists.

Pospelov said that the modern powerful force, first of all the unbreakable socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, is defending the cause of peace. The solidarity and fraternal mutual assistance of socialist countries, the entire international communist movement and the workers' movement, loyalty to Leninism, and loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism are the invincible guarantee of the socialist cause and the cause of peace.

Pospelov said that after the formation of the socialist system, the principle of proletarian internationalism became the basis of national policy in the relations between socialist countries, and became the basis of a new type of international relations. The socialist family is a voluntary alliance of equal and free peoples, who consciously unite their strength to build socialism and protect their achievements from the aggression of imperialists.

Mutual promotion in the cause of socialist construction, a desire to help each other, and achieving a common economic upsurge that benefits every socialist country and the entire socialist camp, are the main goals of socialist countries' cooperation. The same economic and political structure between socialist countries, and the absence of antagonistic contradictions between them, enable them to organize the closest political, economic, and cultural cooperation for peace and socialism.

In the years since the emergence of the world socialist system, socialist countries have accumulated a lot of experience in comprehensive cooperation. The communist and workers' parties of socialist countries have theoretically summarized a wealth of practical experience in the "Declaration" for the struggle for socialism and peace. The principles in the Declaration regarding several major laws in socialist revolution and socialist construction in all countries that take the road of socialism, and the necessity to correctly apply the basic principles of communism in accordance with the historical conditions and national characteristics of each country, are of great significance.

The Declaration condemned revisionism, which is the main danger under the current conditions, as well as dogmatism and sectarianism, which weaken the ties between the party and the masses. In terms of their ideological views, modern revisionists are not much different from old-fashioned reformists like Bernstein and opportunists of the Second International like Kautsky. Concealing the class contradictions between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, abandoning class struggle, embellishing capitalism, accommodating the capitalist system, and fantasizing that socialism may "evolve" from capitalism, all of these, after slight changes and modifications, become the theoretical merchandise of modern revisionism.

Pospelov then talked about the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. He said that this draft contains some common principles of Marxism-Leninism, and some correct summaries. However, in the draft program, especially in those parts related to the international situation, the world communist movement and the workers' movement, and certain ideological principled issues, there is a tendency to oppose one's own special position to the consistent Marxist-Leninist views of all other communist and workers' parties. Everyone knows that this consistent view is expressed in the documents of the most representative and authoritative international conference - the two declarations. The draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia puts forward a series of basic arguments that contradict the two declarations and attempt to take a neutral stance on issues where Marxists cannot be neutral.

Pospelov said that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia objectively appears to be a document that is essentially aimed at weakening the unity of communist and workers' parties and weakening the unity of socialist countries. Therefore, it is not accidental that this document was praised by the bourgeois press as soon as it was published. We hope that the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia will make the necessary improvements before passing the final draft of the program.

Pospelov emphasized that consistently implementing the principles of proletarian internationalism, equality, and fraternal mutual assistance is a decisive condition for further unity of socialist countries. Despite the fanfare of the leaders of US imperialism, saying that they can promote "the crisis of communism," the unity of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries is now unprecedentedly consolidated.

The third part of Pospelov's report discussed Leninism - the banner for the struggle for communism, for the bright future of mankind.

Pospelov said that our party follows Lenin's teachings and guides the Soviet people to strive to realize the most sublime and greatest ideas of mankind - the ideas of communism. Lenin formulated the plan for communist construction and determined its main directions. Lenin pointed out the extremely important significance of industrialization, including national electrification, for the victory of communism; Lenin formulated the cooperative plan for establishing large-scale, collective, and mechanized agriculture; Lenin put forward the slogan of cultural revolution. Lenin repeatedly emphasized that communism - the highest-level social system - will win victory on the basis of highly developed labor productivity, mastering advanced technology, cultivating conscious labor discipline, and attracting working people to manage production.

On the issue of how to solve the new issues that arise in the process of the development of Soviet society and our economy, the Communist Party does not seek answers in individual quotations of Marxist-Leninist theory, but analyzes and summarizes the rich experience of communist construction based on the basic principles of this theory before making a response. The Party has solved a series of huge new practical problems, such as: reclaiming 36 million hectares of wasteland, reorganizing the management of industry and construction, expanding the rights and activities of trade unions, further developing the collective farm system, and reorganizing machine tractor stations. This has ensured a more rapid development of productive forces and opened up broader space for the creative initiative of working people and social organizations. At the same time, these measures also have principled, theoretical, and programmatic significance.

Pospelov then talked about the huge growth of the Soviet Union's economic strength. He said that under the current technical conditions, the Soviet Union can smoothly complete the fifteen-year plan to increase industrial production by two to three times. However, Soviet science and technology must continue to develop. It may be worth imagining the extremely important issues that Soviet scientists are studying, such as not only the peaceful use of atomic energy, but also the peaceful use of controllable thermonuclear energy. This means that there will be an unprecedented turning point in technology, which can liberate a large amount of human labor and greatly accelerate the transition to communism.

Pospelov emphasized that the great example of socialist countries transitioning to communism and gradually improving the living standards of their people will have an irresistible attraction to the working people of capitalist countries. The ideals of socialism and communism will penetrate more deeply into the consciousness of the working people of capitalist countries. The power of the example of socialist countries will inspire the people of capitalist countries to more actively launch struggles, strive to transform society, and strive to liberate themselves from the capitalist enslavement of wage labor. But this will have to be decided by themselves. Socialist countries will never force others to accept this decision.

Pospelov finally said that human reason, the genius of mankind, has entered the universe and approached other planets. Won't people find the reason and will to sooner or later end this long-decayed social system, which is often crisis-ridden, war-ridden, threatened by unemployment, and currently threatens mankind with the greatest disaster, even with destruction?

As our great teachers Marx and Lenin foresaw, mankind will inevitably go through several stages to its bright future, to communism. This is beyond doubt!

    列宁主义是为共产主义的胜利而斗争的不可战胜的旗帜
    苏共中央书记波斯别洛夫在列宁诞辰八十八周年纪念大会上的报告（摘要）
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏共中央书记波斯别洛夫22日在莫斯科举行的列宁诞辰八十八周年纪念大会上作了报告。报告的题目是：“列宁主义是为共产主义的胜利而斗争的不可战胜的旗帜”。
    波斯别洛夫在开头说，今天苏联人民和全世界劳动人民纪念革命的天才、劳动人民的伟大导师和朋友弗·伊·列宁诞辰八十八周年。列宁英明地看到了革命的道路，对阶级力量的对比和每个历史时刻的特点作了科学的、马克思主义的分析，确定了党的战略和策略。列宁预见到了觉醒起来从事革命斗争的人民所应该走的方向，预见到了人类未来的命运。
    列宁对机会主义、对修正主义者、对离开马克思主义原则的人、对离开阶级的、无产阶级的观点和政策的人采取不调和的态度。列宁的关于社会主义的革命和建成社会主义社会的理论获得了极其伟大的胜利。今天，马克思列宁主义思想已经掌握了亿万人，成为一支巨大的物质力量、历史的伟大动力。垂死的资本主义的保卫者和走狗企图破坏或者哪怕是削弱马克思列宁主义思想日益增长的影响，这种企图是徒劳的。
    波斯别洛夫的报告的第一部分谈的是列宁关于社会主义革命和建设共产主义的理论的胜利。
    波斯别洛夫指出，马克思发现了资本主义社会发生、发展和灭亡的经济规律，指出了作为资本主义掘墓人的无产阶级的伟大历史使命。列宁揭示了资本主义在其最后阶段，即帝国主义阶段的发展和灭亡的规律。列宁指明，在资本主义发展的这个最高阶段，在客观上准备着向社会主义社会过渡的物质技术前提。同时，帝国主义意味着生产力遭到疯狂的浪费和破坏，意味着千百万人在战争中死亡，这种战争是由于帝国主义社会制度、由于垄断资本追求最高利润、追求世界霸权而产生的。
    列宁发现了资本主义在帝国主义时代经济发展和政治发展的不平衡的规律。由于这个规律，一些资本主义国家比另一些资本主义国家发展得更快一些；各种垄断资本集团之间的疯狂竞争日益加剧；不断产生重新瓜分世界的愿望，于是爆发帝国主义所产生的战争。第一、第二两次世界大战的客观结果都是削弱了世界帝国主义体系总的战线，使帝国主义内部矛盾更加尖锐化，造成了在最薄弱环节上突破帝国主义战线的可能。由于帝国主义的削弱，社会主义有可能首先在少数国家甚至在单独一个国家获胜。1917年，俄国是帝国主义体系最弱的环节。伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，是列宁的社会主义革命理论的鲜明确证。
    波斯别洛夫说，俄国是世界帝国主义锁链最薄弱的一环。但是，俄国也是革命的无产阶级世界阵线中最坚强的一环。还在二十世纪初，革命运动的中心就转移到俄国。而在西欧，工人运动中改良主义占了上风，因此，工人运动思想上受到削弱，政治上解除了武装。
    在准备和实行伟大的十月社会主义革命的时期，列宁的党把各种革命运动：争取建立苏维埃政权的无产阶级社会主义运动、争取和平和反对帝国主义的一般民主运动、要求土地的农民革命民主运动、俄国各民族的民族解放运动等汇合成一个统一而强大的革命洪流。这些不同的运动汇合成一个统一的巨大的革命洪流后，就迅速地决定了俄国资本主义的命运。
    1917年10月的伟大社会主义革命在它发展的最初几个月中是流血最少的革命，这说明了无产阶级革命的力量和无产阶级的伟大的人道主义。
    波斯别洛夫说，在苏维埃政权的最初年代里，苏联不得不克服由于要同帝国主义战争和武装干涉所造成的破坏进行斗争而产生的巨大困难，这些困难曾经被资本主义的奴仆和卫士、各种各样的改良主义者和修正主义者所广泛利用。
    在第一次世界大战结束后，欧洲资本主义的状况是极不稳定的。在匈牙利、德国、波兰和其他国家都发生了强大的革命运动。但是改良主义者和修正主义者尽了一切力量企图挽救正在沉没的资本主义大船。德国右翼社会民主党人直接同威廉的军官和将军勾搭起来，帮助镇压德国的革命。改良主义者用“革命的代价”来恐吓西欧的无产阶级，他们证明说，可以“改进”资本主义，可以用资本主义和平进化的方法进入社会主义。他们不怀好意地利用了俄国工人和农民英勇斗争的困难和经济破坏；他们别有用心地一字不提所有这些困难首先是战争和外国干涉的结果，而不是革命的结果。
    可是历史证明，保存资本主义的“代价”比修正马克思主义的修正主义者和资本主义形形色色改良主义奴才所恐吓工人阶级的、无产阶级革命的困难要大得多。帝国主义不仅没有使资本主义“民主化”，反而产生了像法西斯主义那样血腥而骇人听闻的产儿。
    波斯别洛夫说，第二次世界大战与第一次世界大战一样，也是由帝国主义世界体系的矛盾引起的。当时，德国法西斯几乎奴役了整个欧洲大陆，给欧洲各国人民造成了难以想像的贫穷和痛苦。只有社会主义国家的伟大的力量和英雄主义，我们共产党的英明而有远见的列宁政策才拯救了人类，使人类免遭法西斯完全奴役的威胁。
    苏联人民在伟大的卫国战争中蒙受了严重的牺牲和损失。任何一个资本主义国家，只要遭到这样严重的损失，那就会在几十年以内不能恢复原气。而只有苏联，由于社会主义社会制度的优越性，由于计划经济制度，由于劳动人民切身关心国民经济高涨，不仅恢复了被破坏的一切，而且远远超过了战前的水平。社会主义的敌人指望长久阻碍苏联向共产主义的发展，指望社会主义和共产主义思想的吸引力会因此而削弱，这种算盘破产了。今天，在资产阶级国家中恐怕再找不到哪一个经济学家或政治家会否认世界上第一个社会主义国家建立四十年来所获得的巨大成就。社会主义社会制度的奇迹般的力量在全世界面前显示出来了。
    波斯别洛夫说，苏联正在顺利地解决着基本的经济任务：在按人口平均的产量方面赶上并且超过经济上最发达的国家。苏联能够完成这个任务，这一点现在资本主义世界的很多著名人士已经不怀疑了。他们只是争论着时间的问题：有人说经过二十年到二十五年可能达到这一点，另一些人认为苏联甚至在七十年代初期，也就是说经过十二年到十五年，就可以达到这一点。
    波斯别洛夫指出，联合国最近发表的苏联和资本主义国家经济发展速度统计年鉴中的资料是值得注意的。从1953年到1956年的四年当中，资本主义的工业生产增长了16％，而苏联的生产却增长了41％，但是美国的生产在这几年中仅仅增长了7％。
    现在美国已经进入了经济危机阶段，很多工业部门的生产水平正在急剧地下降，失业的人数超过了六百万。而苏联现在正处在经济发展繁荣时期，经济各部门都在蒸蒸日上。这并非仅仅生产量在增加，而是工业、农业、运输业、整个经济和文化都在大跃进，是新技术的采用，新资源和潜力的发挥，是苏维埃社会发展中新的质的变化。
    波斯别洛夫的报告的第二部分谈的是我们时代的基本内容是从资本主义过渡到社会主义。
    波斯别洛夫说，我们时代的基本内容是俄国伟大的十月社会主义革命所创始的从资本主义向社会主义的过渡。在十月革命思想的影响下，在世界上第一个社会主义国家伟大榜样的影响下，由于法西斯主义的崩溃和民族解放运动的巨大高涨，由于声势浩大的反法西斯民主运动转变成社会主义运动，世界的面貌根本地改变了。
    1957年11月举行的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言正确地指出：“现在，占世界人口三分之一以上的九亿五千多万人已经走上了社会主义道路，正在建设新生活。社会主义力量的巨大发展鼓励了战后反帝国主义的民族运动的巨大发展。在最近十二年内，除了中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以外，还有七亿多人挣脱了殖民枷锁，建立了自己的民族主权国家。仍然受奴役的殖民地和半殖民地的人民，正在加强争取本民族的解放的斗争。社会主义和民族解放运动的发展剧烈地加速了帝国主义的没落过程。帝国主义已经丧失了对于大部分人类的原有统治。”
    波斯别洛夫说，就是在约有五亿人口的帝国主义国家中，也有相当大一部分劳动人民在摆脱帝国主义的影响，日益坚决地反抗帝国主义和垄断资本的政策，为改善生活条件、争取民主权利、争取和平和社会主义而斗争。
    波斯别洛夫说，资本主义国家之间的矛盾日益加深。美国帝国主义侵略集团打着“反共”的幌子，力图统治世界大多数国家，力图把它的资本主义伙伴和竞争者从它们所占据的阵地上排挤出去。同时，美国某些侵略集团企图把资本主义世界的所有反动势力纠合到自己的周围，对社会主义国家进行经常不断的敌对的颠覆活动。世界反动势力又在武装前希特勒将领，这次用的是最危险的原子武器来武装他们。看来，第二次世界大战的教训没有被吸取。
    波斯别洛夫问，国际紧张局势加剧的责任应当由谁来负？战争的危险来自何方？
    现在有一种自私自利和不人道的贪图高额利润的势力，它们醉心于战争，用美国报纸的生动说法来说，它们“惧怕和平”。这就是垄断资本，首先是美国垄断资本。他们厚颜无耻地责难苏联有侵略意图，并且把我们的外交说成是和平宣传。事实上，憎恨和平的是他们。
    人们常常向往着和平和最大的幸福，人们祈求着世界和平。现代帝国主义的思想家却认为战争是消费的最好方法和最大的幸福。这已经不是现代资本主义精神上的贫乏，而是完全沦为道德上的堕落了。
    波斯别洛夫强调说，社会主义国家不需要战争。它们只需要和平来充分发展它们的经济，向共产主义过渡。社会主义力量在世界上已经壮大到足以阻止战争。
    波斯别洛夫接着说，由于社会主义和民主力量的增长，由于民族解放运动的加强，由于世界面貌的改变，关于资本主义包围这一概念的问题也要从新的角度来提了。
    正如赫鲁晓夫同志讲话中所指出的，现在谈资本主义包围是不正确的，因为苏联和整个社会主义阵营、整个社会主义体系的力量已经壮大到如此程度，要想把它们包围、把它们置于像苏联几十年所处的包围状态，现在已经不可能。但是，只要存在着帝国主义，侵略战争的基础也就存在，帝国主义侵略社会主义国家的危险也就存在。
    波斯别洛夫说，现代的强大力量，首先是以苏联为首的牢不可破的社会主义阵营捍卫着和平事业。社会主义国家、整个国际共产主义运动和工人运动的团结一致和兄弟般的相互帮助，对列宁主义的忠诚，对无产阶级国际主义原则的忠诚，这些是社会主义事业和和平事业的不可战胜的保证。
    波斯别洛夫说，社会主义体系形成后，无产阶级国际主义原则成了社会主义国家之间相互关系中的国家政策基础，成为新型国际关系的基础。社会主义国家大家庭是平等自由的各国人民的自愿联盟，他们自觉地把自己的力量联合起来建设社会主义、保护自己的胜利果实不受帝国主义者的侵犯。
    在社会主义建设事业中相互促进，渴望彼此帮助，并且取得有利于每一个社会主义国家和整个社会主义阵营的共同经济的高涨，是社会主义国家合作的主要目的。社会主义国家之间相同的经济和政治结构，以及它们之间没有对抗性的矛盾，使它们能够为了和平和社会主义组织最密切的政治、经济和文化合作。
    在世界社会主义体系产生以来的这些年里，社会主义国家已经积累了不少全面合作的经验。社会主义国家共产党和工人党在“宣言”中从理论上总结了为社会主义与和平事业而斗争的大量实践经验。宣言中关于一切走社会主义道路的国家在社会主义革命和社会主义建设方面的几个主要规律以及必须根据每一个国家的历史条件和民族特点来正确运用共产主义基本原则的原理具有巨大意义。
    宣言谴责了在目前条件下作为主要危险的修正主义以及削弱党和群众联系的教条主义和宗派主义。就其思想见解来说，现代修正主义者同伯恩施坦这一类老牌改良主义者和考茨基之流的第二国际的机会主义者并没有多大距离。掩盖无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级矛盾，放弃阶级斗争，粉饰资本主义，迁就资本主义制度，幻想资本主义可能发生社会主义“进化”，所有这一切经过稍许变化和修改就成了现代修正主义的理论货色。
    波斯别洛夫接着谈到南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案。他说，这个草案包含着马克思列宁主义的一些共同原理，有一些正确的总结。但是，在纲领草案中，特别是在有关国际局势、世界共产主义运动和工人运动、某些意识形态上的原则性问题的那些部分中，有某种要把自己的特殊立场同其他所有共产党和工人党的一致的马克思列宁主义见解对立起来的倾向。大家知道，这种一致的见解表现在最具有代表性的和最权威的国际会议的文件——两项宣言中。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案提出了一系列基本论点，这些论点与两个宣言相违背，企图在马克思主义者不可能中立的问题上采取中立立场。
    波斯别洛夫说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案在客观上看来是一个实质上以削弱共产党和工人党的团结、以削弱社会主义国家的团结为目的的文件。因此，这个文件刚一发表，就得到了资产阶级报刊的赞扬，这并不是偶然的。我们希望，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会在通过纲领的定稿以前能作出必要的改进。
    波斯别洛夫强调说，始终不渝地执行无产阶级国际主义、平等和兄弟互助等原则，是社会主义国家进一步团结的决定性条件。尽管美帝国主义的头目大吹大擂，说他们能够促成“共产主义的危机”，但是，社会主义国家共产党和工人党的团结现在却空前地巩固。
    波斯别洛夫的报告的第三部分谈的是列宁主义——为共产主义、为人类的光辉未来而斗争的旗帜。
    波斯别洛夫说，我们的党遵循列宁的学说，引导苏联人民努力去实现人类最崇高、最伟大的思想——共产主义思想。列宁拟定了共产主义建设的计划，确定了它的主要方向。列宁指出工业化其中包括全国电气化对共产主义胜利的极其重要的意义；列宁制定了建立大型的、集体的、机械化的农业的合作社计划；列宁提出了文化革命的口号。列宁曾不只一次地强调指出，共产主义——最高级的社会制度将在高度发展劳动生产率、掌握先进技术、培养自觉的劳动纪律和吸引劳动人民管理生产的基础上取得胜利。
    在如何解决苏维埃社会和我们经济的发展过程中所出现的新课题的问题上，共产党并不是到马克思列宁主义理论的个别引语中去找寻答案，而是根据这种理论的基本原则分析和总结共产主义建设的丰富经验后再作出回答。党由于解决了一系列巨大的新的实际问题，例如：开垦三千六百万公顷荒地、改组工业和建筑业的管理、扩大工会权利和活动方式、进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站，它就保证了生产力更迅速的发展，为劳动人民和社会团体的创造主动性打开了更加广阔的活动天地。同时，这些措施也具有原则性的、理论性的和纲领性的意义。
    波斯别洛夫接着谈到目前苏联经济力量的巨大增长。他说，在现今的技术条件下，苏联能够顺利地完成把工业生产增加到两倍到三倍的十五年计划。但是，苏联的科学和技术还要向前发展。不妨设想一下苏联科学家正在研究的极重要的问题，例如，不仅可以和平利用原子能，而且可以和平利用可控制的热核能。这意味着在技术上将会出现一个空前的转折，可以解放大量的人类劳动，大大加速向共产主义的过渡。
    波斯别洛夫强调说，向共产主义过渡并逐年提高本国人民生活水平的社会主义国家的伟大范例，将以不可遏制的吸引力对资本主义国家的劳动人民产生影响。社会主义和共产主义的理想，将更深地深入到资本主义国家劳动人民的意识中。社会主义国家范例的力量，将唤起资本主义国家的人民更积极地展开斗争，争取改造社会，争取从雇佣的资本主义的奴役下解放出来。但是，这将要由他们自己来决定。社会主义国家永远不会强迫别人接受这种决定。
    波斯别洛夫最后说，人的理智，人类的天才已经进入了宇宙和接近其他星球。难道人就不会找到理智和意志来或早或迟结束这种早已腐朽、经常有危机、战争、失业的威胁、并在目前情况下以最大的灾难威胁着人类、甚至以毁灭威胁着人类的社会制度吗？
    正如我们伟大的导师马克思和列宁所预见到的那样，人类必将经过若干阶段走向自己光辉的未来，走向共产主义。这是毫无疑问的！
