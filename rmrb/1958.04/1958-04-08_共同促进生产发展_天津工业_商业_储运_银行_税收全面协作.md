    Jointly Promote Production Development
    Tianjin's Industry, Commerce, Storage & Transportation, Banking, and Taxation Fully Collaborate
    (Our newspaper, Tianjin, 7th dispatch) The collaboration between the industrial and commercial sectors in Tianjin is further expanding into a comprehensive collaboration among industry, commerce, storage & transportation, banking, and taxation, jointly striving for a great leap forward in industrial production.
    Since the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a collaboration conference for the heads of industrial and commercial departments in February this year, leading cadres from both sectors have left their offices, visiting each other and negotiating solutions to problems face-to-face. Commercial departments proposed "produce as much as industry does, purchase as much as industry does," and "supply whatever raw materials are needed." Industrial departments also proposed "improve product quality, reduce costs," and "produce whatever the market needs."
    In the past, some products were in great demand in the market, but industrial departments were unwilling to produce them. Now, most of them have resumed production. In the past, when purchasing industrial products, commercial department personnel often simply complained about the poor quality of factory products and were overly critical during acceptance. However, when the market supply was tight or when the purchase plan was not completed at the end of the month, they relaxed inspection and accepted some genuinely unqualified goods. They rarely specifically assisted factories in improving product quality and improving designs. Now, various purchasing stations have collected more than 2,000 samples of advanced products and some product drawings and materials from Shanghai, Qingdao, Jinan, and abroad for the industrial departments to refer to, and have compiled consumers' opinions into materials and sent them to relevant factories.
    In the past, the purchasing station's purchasing procedures were cumbersome, which wasted manpower and material resources and prolonged the time for factories to recover payments for goods. Now, all purchasing stations have implemented the method of having inspectors go to the factory workshops to conduct inspections, counting, and invoicing as production progresses, sending the goods directly from the factory to various places. This not only strengthened the relationship between industry and commerce, but also saved a lot of freight for the state. Industrial departments have also implemented fixed delivery dates, balanced deliveries, and actively assisted commercial departments in overcoming the phenomenon of supply plans and transportation plans falling through. In order to solve problems in a timely manner, many managers and factory directors have established a regular contact system.
    The new situation of close cooperation and common leap forward between industry and commerce has promoted the storage & transportation, banking, and taxation departments. Employees of the storage and transportation company are supporting the large-scale purchase and sale of commercial purchasing and supply departments with practical actions to increase warehouse capacity, and have put forward the slogan of "more storage and faster transportation." Now, the employees of the warehouses under this company guarantee to eliminate accidents of commodity mold and deterioration, and take measures such as inverting and combining stacks of inventory commodities to increase warehouse capacity and ensure that there is a place to store all the goods purchased by the purchasing and supply stations.
    Bank employees promptly revised some inappropriate rules and regulations that could be changed immediately. In the past, the bank stipulated that it would not handle the sending of settlement vouchers to other places on Sundays. If the purchasing and supply station shipped goods to other places on Saturday night or Sunday, the settlement procedures would have to be delayed until the third or second day, which would delay the purchasing and supply station's receipt of payment for more than one day. Now, in order to speed up the capital turnover of industrial and commercial departments and reduce expenses, the bank has implemented a system of handling the sending of settlement vouchers on Sundays. At the same time, the settlement time for telegraphic transfers to other places has been extended from 7 pm in the past to 12 pm. The time for exchanging bills between industrial and commercial departments in the city has also been extended.
    The city's tax workers are also doing everything possible to improve their work, break through the old rules and regulations that bind productivity, and simplify procedures. For a business tax levied by the Heping District Tax Bureau on the Tianjin Textile Station, it used to take eight working days to complete, but now it only takes half an hour, which greatly facilitates the operation of the enterprise. The tax collection offices and procedure windows of the tax bureaus in various districts have extended their working hours, and people are also on duty during Sundays and study hours to handle matters as they come, without waiting or delaying, so as to facilitate industrial and commercial enterprises.

### 共同促进生产发展  天津工业  商业  储运  银行  税收全面协作

    共同促进生产发展
    天津工业  商业  储运  银行  税收全面协作
    本报天津7日电　天津市工业和商业部门之间的协作，正进一步扩展为工业、商业、储运、银行、税收之间的全面协作，共同为工业生产大跃进而努力。
    自从今年2月中共天津市委召集了工商部门的负责人举行协作会议以后，工商部门的领导干部都走出了办公室，互相访问，面对面地协商解决问题。商业部门提出“工业生产多少、收购多少”，“需要什么原料，就供应什么原料”。工业部门也纷纷提出“提高产品质量、降低成本”，“市场需要什么，就生产什么”。
    过去，有些产品市场很需要，但工业部门不愿生产，现在大都恢复了生产。商业部门的业务人员过去在收购工业品时，往往单纯抱怨工厂产品不好，验收时过于挑剔，一旦市场供应紧张，或是月末未完成进货计划的时候，又放松了检验，把一些真正不合格货物收下来；很少去具体协助工厂提高产品质量、改进花色。现在各个采购站已经分别从上海、青岛、济南等地和国外，收集了二千多种先进产品的样品和一些产品的图纸、资料，供给工业部门参考，并把消费者的意见，分别整理成资料送给有关工厂。
    过去采购站进货手续繁多，既浪费人力物力，又延长工厂收回货款时间。现在各个采购站都实行了验收员下到工厂车间，实行随生产、随清点、随开票等办法，把货物从工厂直接发送各地，不但密切了工商关系，还为国家节约大量运费。工业部门也实行了固定交货日期，均衡交货，主动协助商业部门克服供应计划、运输计划落空的现象。为了及时解决问题，许多经理、厂长建立了定期联系制度。
    工商部门密切协作，共同跃进的新形势，促进了储运、银行和税收部门。储运公司的职工以提高仓库容量的实际行动，支持商业采购供应部门的大购大销，提出了“多存快运”的口号。现在，这个公司所属各仓库的职工们，保证消灭商品霉坏变质的事故，并采取库存商品倒垛、并垛等办法，提高仓库容量，保证采购供应站进货多少都有储存的地方。
    银行职工对一些不适当而又马上能改的规章制度，及时进行了修改。过去，银行规定星期日不办理向外埠发送结算凭证，如果采购供应站在星期六晚上或星期日向外埠发货，办理结算手续就要拖到第三天或第二天，这样就使采购供应站的货款晚收回一天以上。现在银行为了加速工商业部门的资金周转，降低费用，实行了星期日办理发送结算凭证的制度。同时将外埠电报汇款结算时间，由过去的晚七点，延长到十二点。市内工商部门之间的票据交换时间也有所延长。
    全市税务工作人员也在千方百计地改进工作，突破束缚生产力的旧规章制度，简化了手续。和平区税务分局向天津纺织品站征收的一种营业税，过去需要八个工作日才能办完，现在只要半个小时就行了，大大便利了企业的经营。各区税务分局的代收税款处和办理手续的窗口都延长了工作时间，星期日和学习时间也留人值班办公，作到随来随办、不等不压，便利工商企业。
