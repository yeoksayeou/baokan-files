Xinhua News Agency, April 24th. From 8:00 AM on the 23rd to 2:00 PM on the 24th, provinces in the Yellow River, Huai River, and Yangtze River basins experienced widespread rainfall.

Rainfall in Shaanxi and northeastern Sichuan was approximately 30 to 60 millimeters. In southern Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, northern Hubei, and northern and central Jiangsu, rainfall was approximately 20 to 40 millimeters. Eastern Gansu, western Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shanxi, and northern Hebei also received 10 to 20 millimeters.

According to responsible individuals in relevant departments, this is a timely rain. For the serious drought that has occurred in certain areas of the Northwest and North China, this is a major piece of good news. It has initially replenished the soil moisture urgently needed by crops, ensuring a good harvest for winter wheat, the emergence and growth of spring wheat, and the sowing of autumn crops. The problem of not being able to replant summer fields due to missing seedlings has also been resolved to varying degrees. Party and government leading organs in the aforementioned rainfall provinces are urgently mobilizing all forces to seize the opportunity of the rain to rush planting, inspect the emergence of summer seedlings, and carry out replanting.

Currently, this rainfall area is moving towards Northeast China. It is estimated that before the 25th, Liaoning, Jilin, and the Shandong Peninsula will also experience moderate to heavy rain.

    黄河淮河长江流域各省
    普降及时雨　突击抢种忙
    降雨区域正向东北地区移动
    新华社24日讯　从23日八时到24日下午二时止，黄河流域、淮河流域和长江流域各省普遍降雨。
    陕西和四川东北部的降雨量大约有三十到六十公厘。河北南部、河南、山东、安徽、湖北北部、江苏北部和中部，降雨量约有二十到四十公厘。甘肃东部、内蒙古自治区西部、山西和河北北部也下了十到二十公厘。
    据有关部门负责人说，这是一场及时雨。这次雨对于西北、华北某些地区发生的严重干旱现象来说，是一件很大的喜事。它初步弥补了农作物迫切需要的墒情，可以保证冬小麦的丰收，春小麦的出苗生长以及秋田作物的播种。夏田缺苗不能补种的问题也得到了不同程度的解决。上述降雨省份党政领导机关正紧急动员一切力量，趁雨突击抢种，检查夏田出苗并进行补种。
    目前这片降雨区域正向东北地区移动，估计25日以前，辽宁、吉林和山东半岛也将降中等雨和大雨。
