　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 26th: Vientiane Dispatch: The Lao Patriotic Party’s newspaper, "Patriotic News," recently published an article exposing that certain foreigners are engaging in various conspiracies in Laos, attempting to prevent the Lao National Assembly member by-elections, scheduled for May 4th, from being held in a fair and reasonable manner.

　　The article pointed out that these people are also plotting to overthrow the Lao coalition government and create a political crisis. These foreigners are using a lot of money to bribe certain Lao people, wanting them to undermine the unity of the people. These people are spreading rumors, engaging in instigation, distortion, and slanderous propaganda. They are also using the rights of some people to intimidate, arrest, and brutally torture the people, especially former Pathet Lao Fighting Units personnel and those who cooperated with the resistance forces during the war of resistance.

　　The article said that the Lao people are very resentful of these foreigners' acts of interference, because their behavior is part of a conspiracy to turn Laos into their own colony and military base.

　　The article expressed the hope that all Lao people can unite in harmony, so that the supplementary elections can be conducted fairly and successfully, and resolutely oppose the destructive conspiracies of those who do not want Laos to achieve peace, neutrality, democracy, and prosperity.

    外国阴谋分子在老挝钻空子
    企图破坏补选推翻联合政府
    新华社河内26日电　万象消息：老挝爱国党的机关报“爱国报”最近发表文章，揭露某些外国人正在老挝进行各种阴谋活动，企图使将在5月4日举行的老挝国民议会议员补充选举不能在公正合理的情况下举行。
    文章指出，这些人还阴谋推翻老挝联合政府，制造政治危机。这些外国人用很多钱贿赂某些老挝人，要他们破坏人民的团结。这些人散布流言蜚语，进行挑拨歪曲和诽谤宣传。他们还利用一些人的权利，恫吓、逮捕和惨酷拷打人民，特别是前寮国战斗部队人员和在抗战期间同抗战力量合作的人。
    文章说，老挝人民非常愤恨这些外国人的干涉行为。因为他们的行为是企图把老挝变成自己的殖民地和军事基地的阴谋的一部分。
    文章表示希望老挝全体人民能够团结、和睦，使补充选举能够进行得公正和成功，并且坚决反对那些不让老挝得到和平、中立、民主、繁荣的人的破坏阴谋。
