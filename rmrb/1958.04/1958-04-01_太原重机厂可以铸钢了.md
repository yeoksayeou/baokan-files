    Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant Can Now Cast Steel
    The three-ton electric furnace in the newly built steel casting workshop of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant was officially put into production on the 26th.
    In the past, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant could not smelt steel and cast it. The cast steel parts and steel ingots needed for production all relied on support from brother factories. Because the supply sometimes could not meet the demand or the quality could not be guaranteed, production was often suspended and waiting for materials, and the variety of products was also limited. After the three-ton electric furnace is put into production, it will not only produce 6,000 tons of products a year, creating 5 million yuan of wealth for the country, but also accelerate the construction speed of the plant's 30-ton open-hearth furnace, so that the steel casting workshop can be put into production earlier. At the same time, it can also promote the successive early commissioning of workshops such as hydraulic presses, heat treatment and cast iron. In this way, the Heavy Machinery Plant will be able to manufacture heavy equipment such as rolling mills and hydraulic presses, which are most urgently needed in our country, ahead of schedule.

    太原重机厂可以铸钢了
    太原重型机器厂新建铸钢车间的三吨电炉在26日正式投入生产。
    太原重型机器厂过去不能炼钢浇铸，生产上需要的铸钢件及钢锭全靠兄弟工厂支援；因为有时供不应求或不能保证质量，常常停工待料，并且使产品品种受到限制。三吨电炉投入生产以后，不仅一年能够出六千吨产品，为国家创造五百万元财富，而且会加速这个厂三十吨平炉的建设速度，使铸钢车间全面提早投入生产。同时，还可以促使水压机、热处理及铸铁等车间相继提前投入生产。这样，重型机器厂就能够提前制造我国最急需的轧钢机、水压机等重型设备。（新华社）
