In the past, in people's impression, those enamel products with solid quality, beautiful forms, and bright colors were either from Shanghai or Tianjin, and other places were always a bit inferior. But things are changing, and often changing surprisingly. Now, the enamel product quality ranks first in the country, and is already close to the most advanced level internationally, is neither Shanghai nor Tianjin, but the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory located in the Northwest, which has only five years of production history. Maybe some people find this a bit difficult to understand, or suspect there is some special mystery. In fact, there is nothing strange, this dialectical development is everywhere in life. Good and advanced can become bad and backward; bad and backward can be transformed into good and advanced. Of course, this transformation does not come naturally, there are certain factors that cause this change. For the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, learning, and learning with an original spirit, is the decisive factor for change.

There are two kinds of learning methods. One is: without carefully studying others' advanced experiences and scientific technologies, nor studying the specific conditions of their own departments, and absorbing others' experiences according to the actual situation of their own departments, but regarding others' good experiences as immutable things, and applying them mechanically; for what others have not done, they dare not boldly think and boldly do. Learning in this way often does not have good results, and sometimes even spoils things. Because good experiences often develop and change constantly according to the changes in objective conditions. If they are mechanically applied without regard to the specific location, time, and conditions, of course they will not be suitable. This method of learning is a lazy method.

The other is: when learning advanced experiences and scientific technologies, being able to combine them with the actual needs of their own factory and workshop, and thinking independently according to the actual situation of their own production equipment and production tools; not only applying those applicable good experiences, but also combining them with actual conditions to enrich and develop the original experiences, and further boldly innovating, turning them into new creations. This learning method is a creative learning method, that is, having an original spirit.

The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory adopted the latter learning method, and thus achieved great results. They did not mechanically copy, but adopted a dialectical materialist attitude, and demonstrated a bold and innovative spirit in learning advanced experiences. This original spirit is necessary for socialist construction, and should be greatly promoted in all industrial enterprises.

    学习别人也要有独创精神
    文英
    过去，在人们的印象里，那些质地坚固、形式美观、色彩鲜艳的搪瓷产品，不是上海货就是天津货，别的地方总是差一些。可是事情是变化的，而且常常变化得令人吃惊。现在，搪瓷产品质量占全国第一，并且已经接近国际上最先进的水平的，既非上海也非天津，而是地处西北的一个仅仅只有五年生产历史的西安人民搪瓷厂。也许有人觉得这有点不大好理解，或者怀疑其中有什么特殊奥妙。其实并没有什么奇怪，这种辩证的发展，生活中到处都有。好的、先进的可以变为差的落后的；差的落后的可以转化为好的、先进的。当然这种转化并不是自然到来的，有某种因素造成这种变化。对于西安人民搪瓷厂来说，学习，用独创精神来学习，是变化的决定因素。
    有两种学习方法。一种是：没有仔细钻研别人的先进经验和科学技术，也没有研究本部门的具体条件，根据本部门的实际情况来吸取别人的经验，而是把别人的好经验看成是一成不变的东西，拿过来生搬硬套；对于别人所没有做过的，更不敢大胆去想大胆去做。这样学习，效果往往不好，有时甚至把事情做坏。因为好的经验常常是根据客观条件的变化而不断地发展和变化的。如果不根据具体的地点、时间和条件来机械地搬用，当然就不对路。这种学习方法是偷懒的方法。
    另一种是：在学习先进经验和科学技术的时候，能够结合本厂本车间的实际需要，按照自己的生产设备、生产工具的实际情况，开动脑筋、独立思考；不只是运用那些适用的好经验，而且结合实际条件来丰富和发展原有的经验，进一步大胆革新，变成新的创造。这种学习方法，是创造性的学习方法，也就是有独创精神。
    西安人民搪瓷厂就是采取了后一种学习方法，因而取得了很大成果。他们没有生搬硬套，而是采取了辩证唯物主义的态度，在学习先进经验中表现了大胆革新的独创精神。这种独创精神为社会主义建设所必需，在一切工业企业中都要大大发扬。
