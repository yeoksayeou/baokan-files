The Struggle of the People of Cameroon for Independence

At the African National Conference on the 17th, Moumié, Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, spoke, requesting the participating countries to support Cameroon's legitimate rights in the United Nations and other international forums; demanding that the United Nations resolve the Cameroon issue in accordance with the Charter and the Cameroonian people's desire for unification and independence; and requesting that the conference declare its support for the struggle of the Cameroonian people and condemn the bloody repression in the Cameroonian trust territory. Moumié's speech represented the Cameroonian people's desire for national unification and independence, a desire that had been supported by the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held at the end of 1957.

Cameroon has a long history of enslavement and trampling. At the end of the fifteenth century, Portuguese colonialists first arrived here, followed by the Dutch and the British. They arrested and sold black slaves everywhere, plundering ivory. At the end of the eighteenth century, Cameroon was controlled by British colonialists. By 1884, Germany had replaced Britain and invaded Cameroon. In 1902, the German army occupied the entire territory. After the First World War, according to the Treaty of Versailles, Britain and France divided Cameroon. In 1922, the League of Nations decided to make Cameroon a mandated territory, jointly administered by Britain and France. During the Second World War, the Cameroonian people shed blood for the anti-fascist struggle, originally hoping to gain unification and independence after the war. However, in December 1946, the United Nations Trusteeship Council, disregarding the wishes of the Cameroonian people, continued to entrust it to British and French trusteeship.

Cameroon has a total area of ​​more than 449,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 4.5 million. The French-administered area is larger, equivalent to twice the area of ​​Tunisia. The north of Cameroon is sparsely populated, while the south and west are more populous, rich in peanuts, cocoa, coffee, bananas, timber, and other products, with large export volumes. Discovered mineral deposits include gold, tin, and aluminum.

According to the description of Cameroonian writer Ferdinand Oyono, the living standards of the Cameroonian people are the lowest in the world. They live in dark huts far away from European residential areas. Some families have nothing and can only fill their stomachs with bananas. Although the income of the Cameroonian people is very low, prices are very high. The monthly rent for a hut can be as high as 1,000 francs, accounting for a quarter of an ordinary worker's monthly income. Medical and health conditions are very poor, with an average of one doctor for every 70,000 residents. Only a quarter of school-age children attend school.

After the war, the Cameroonian people had always hoped that the trusteeship agreement would guarantee the realization of national unification and independence. However, British and French colonialists attempted to maintain colonial rule for a long time. France is now tightly grasping this area as the last place for colonialism to breathe. However, the Cameroonian people have never relaxed their struggle for independence. In April 1948, in Sanaga-Maritime, the region with the largest number of workers and laboring peasants, the Cameroon People's Union was born, shouldering the task of fighting to improve people's living standards, oppose forced labor, racial discrimination, and land grabbing. Its fighting slogan is "National Unity—Independence." The People's Union developed greatly in a few years. In order to strangle the Cameroonian people's independence struggle, the French colonialists did not hesitate to adopt cruel suppression methods. In February 1955, France used force to disband gatherings of trade unions and other democratic organizations. In May, it carried out a bloody massacre of the marching and demonstrating masses in major cities of Cameroon, resulting in more than 5,000 casualties. The People's Union and other democratic organizations were declared illegal, and many leaders and a large number of members were arrested. However, the colonialists' bloody suppression could not contain the upsurge of the Cameroonian national independence movement. The Cameroon People's Union continued to lead the struggle underground and in the jungles.

In November 1956, France staged a municipal election farce in Cameroon to deceive the people. The Cameroonian people enthusiastically responded to the call of the People's Union and abstained from voting in the election. In the Douala election, only 8,200 people voted out of 68,000 registered voters; and in Yaoundé, only 9,800 people voted out of 24,900 registered voters.

On December 23, 1956, France held local parliamentary elections in Cameroon based on the "Fundamental Law." On the eve of the election, France transferred a large number of troops from Brazzaville, Equatorial Africa, and Chad, and stationed a large number of police forces in the Snaga-Malitingle area, where the Cameroon People's Union was active. Many villages were looted, women and children were shot, and countless people were arrested. After this election, the socialist Mbidda served as Prime Minister. The local parliament accepted the so-called new regulations drafted by France, in which Cameroon's diplomacy, defense, finance, and trade were all controlled by France, and the Legislative Assembly and the government were also at the mercy of the French High Commissioner. This is a mockery of Cameroon's independence!

In the summer of 1956, under the leadership of the People's Union, the Cameroonian people began armed struggle in the jungles of Snaga-Malitingle and established a "National Organizing Committee" to carry out military leadership work. The guerrillas carried out a series of activities during the December 1956 elections. By the end of 1957, armed activities had spread to the Bamileke area, which the colonialists considered the most reliable. Despite Prime Minister Mbidda's use of various deception and threats, armed activities became more frequent. France sent a large number of paratroopers and declared a state of emergency in the Snaga-Malitingle area. However, the guerrilla areas are still expanding.

At the same time, the Cameroonian people's movement for independence has also expanded to the British-administered area. The people in the British-administered area are actively demanding to merge with the French-administered area to become a unified and independent country. Although the French and British colonialists are attempting to continue to maintain colonial rule through violence, the just struggle of the Cameroonian people will eventually achieve final victory.

### 喀麦隆人民争取独立的斗争

    喀麦隆人民争取独立的斗争
    喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃，17日在非洲国家会议上发言，要求与会国在联合国和其他国际场合支持喀麦隆的合法权利；要求联合国根据宪章和喀麦隆争取统一和独立的愿望解决喀麦隆问题；要求会议宣布支持喀麦隆人民的斗争并谴责在喀麦隆托管地进行血腥镇压的行动。穆米埃的发言代表了喀麦隆人民要求祖国统一和独立的愿望，这个愿望曾经得到在1957年底举行的亚非人民团结大会的支持。
    喀麦隆有着一段长期被奴役和被蹂躏的历史。十五世纪末年，葡萄牙殖民者首先来到了这里。继之而来的有荷兰人和英国人。他们到处逮捕和贩卖黑人奴隶，掠夺象牙。十八世纪末，喀麦隆被控制在英国殖民者的手里。到1884年，德国又取代英国侵占了喀麦隆。1902年，德国军队占领了整个喀麦隆。第一次世界大战后，根据凡尔赛条约，英法瓜分了喀麦隆。1922年，国际联盟决定把喀麦隆作为委任统治地，由英法分管。第二次世界大战期间，喀麦隆人民为反法西斯斗争付出了鲜血，原来期望战争结束后可以获得统一和独立，但1946年12月联合国托管理事会不顾喀麦隆人民的愿望，继续把它交由英法托管。
    喀麦隆的总面积有四十四万九千多平方公里，人口四百五十多万。法国的托管部分较大，相当于突尼斯面积的两倍。喀麦隆北部人烟稀少，南部和西部人口较多，盛产花生、可可、咖啡、香蕉和木材等，输出量很大。矿产已发现的有金、锡、铝等。
    根据喀麦隆作家费迪南·奥约诺的描述，喀麦隆人民的生活水平是世界最低的。他们住在远离欧洲人住宅区的阴暗的茅屋中，有些家庭一无所有，只能以香蕉充饥。虽然喀麦隆人民的收入很低，可是物价却很高。一间茅屋每月租价竟达一千法郎，占去一个普通工人每月收入的四分之一。医药卫生条件很差，平均七万居民才有一个医生。全国只有四分之一的学龄儿童入学。
    战后喀麦隆人民一直期待托管协定能保证他们实现祖国的统一和独立。但英法殖民主义者却企图长期保持殖民统治。法国现在更是紧紧地抓住这一地区作为殖民主义最后喘息的地方。但喀麦隆人民从来没有放松过争取独立的斗争。1948年4月，在拥有工人和劳动农民数量最多的地区萨纳加·马里梯莫，喀麦隆人民联盟诞生了，它肩负起为提高人民生活水平、反对强迫劳动、种族歧视和强占土地而斗争的任务。它的战斗口号是“民族团结—独立”。人民联盟在几年内有了很大的发展。法国殖民者为了扼杀喀麦隆人民的独立斗争，不惜采取残酷的镇压手段。1955年2月，法国使用武力解散工会和其他民主组织的集会，5月，对喀麦隆各大城市的游行示威群众进行了血腥大屠杀，伤亡竟达五千余人，人民联盟等民主组织被宣布为非法，许多领袖和大批成员被逮捕。但是，殖民主义者的血腥镇压，遏止不住喀麦隆民族独立运动的高涨。喀麦隆人民联盟在地下和丛林中继续领导斗争。
    1956年11月，法国在喀麦隆扮演市政选举的丑剧进行欺骗。喀麦隆人民热烈响应人民联盟的号召，在选举时弃权。在杜阿拉的选举中，六万八千个登记投票的人中，只有八千二百人投了票；而在雅温得，两万四千九百个登记投票的人中，只有九千八百人投了票。
    1956年12月23日，法国根据“根本法”在喀麦隆举行了地方议会的选举。选举前夕，法国从布拉萨维尔、赤道非洲和乍得调来了大批军队，并在喀麦隆人民联盟活动地区斯纳加·马利丁勒驻了大量警察部队。许多村庄被洗劫，妇女儿童遭到枪杀，无数人被捕。这次选举后，社会党人姆比达担任总理。地方议会接受了法国拟定的所谓新规章，喀麦隆的外交、国防、财政和贸易等概由法国掌握，而立法议会和政府也都听命于法国的高级专员。这是对喀麦隆独立的一种嘲笑！
    1956年夏季，喀麦隆人民在人民联盟的领导下，在斯纳加·马利丁勒的丛林中开始了武装斗争，并设立了“全国组织委员会”来进行军事领导工作。游击队在1956年12月的选举期间，进行了一系列的活动。1957年底，武装活动已蔓延到殖民主义者认为最可靠的巴米勒克区。尽管姆比达总理使用了种种欺骗和威胁手段，但是武装活动更加频繁起来。法国曾派去大批伞兵，并在斯纳加·马利丁勒地区宣布紧急状态。但是，游击区仍在扩大中。
    同时，喀麦隆人民要求独立的运动也扩大到英托管区。英托管区的人民积极要求同法托管区合并，成为统一和独立的国家。尽管法、英殖民主义者妄图使用暴力继续维持殖民统治，但是喀麦隆人民的正义斗争，终将得到最后胜利。
