    A Thousand Words to Express My Heartfelt Feelings
    Dear Second Sister-in-law,
    The moment I pick up my pen, my heart flies back to our hometown, to your side. Hometown is about to enter "late spring, the grass grows in Jiangnan, miscellaneous flowers bloom, and orioles fly in flocks." Today is Sunday, are you taking the children out for a spring outing? Did you fly kites? It's truly enchanting!

    In the North, although it is still chilly in spring, the spring warmth has already bloomed in people's hearts. This spring warmth in our hearts is bestowed by the "Rectification Campaign." The Rectification Campaign is a raging fire, burning out everyone's enthusiasm and wisdom, even housewives are no exception. At the street residents' rectification meetings, I heard many older sisters speaking from the bottom of their hearts. In order to make all our work better, from the seven basic necessities of life to national affairs, they enthusiastically put forward opinions and debated, unprecedentedly grasping the weapon of criticism and self-criticism just like the cadres.

    However, there are also a very few sisters who look indifferent, speak very little, or even remain silent. I heard from my Second Brother's letter that your performance at the street residents' rectification meeting in your hometown was also like this. This really makes me sad. Why are you, and these few sisters, so unenthusiastic?

    You will definitely say, "It's not that I'm not enthusiastic, it's just that I have nothing to say!" Is there really nothing to say? That can't be. Think about it, don't you always have countless things to say about family matters, family members' matters, children's matters, and your own matters? Why is that? This is because you are one of the masters in the family, and you are the master of yourself, so you care about everything that belongs to you, and you won't miss even the smallest details. It can be seen that if you put this sense of ownership on people and things outside of your family and yourself, you will also have something to say. Aren't housewives also one of the masters of our country and our society? Of course, you know that they are. If you are a master but do not exercise the rights of a master and do not fulfill the obligations of a master, isn't that self-abandonment? Moreover, the content of this rectification campaign is extremely broad and rich, including various personal matters that are originally of concern to every family and individual.

    You have a sense of ownership, you care, you have something to say, but you are a little "unable to say it," firstly because you are afraid of saying something wrong, and secondly because you are afraid of hurting feelings, right? I say, Second Sister-in-law, don't be afraid of this or that, as long as we stand upright and are sincerely good for others and good for everyone, we can say anything, and we should say anything. If we don't say it, how can we know whether what we think is right or wrong? If we are wrong, we will correct it, and we will improve ourselves as a result. If others take offense, that's their problem, we will continue to offer opinions and correct them until everyone understands and is correct. If we speak behind people's backs instead of to their faces, or keep our words in our hearts and let them become knots, that will really hurt feelings!

    Second Sister-in-law, do you remember that when we were together before, we often talked all night long, and we always talked endlessly even when we were working or playing during the day. Besides talking about ourselves, we also talked about others, about this family and that family. Many things in the world could arouse our interest and become our topics. You were so optimistic, cheerful, frank, and straightforward, and the various constraints of the old society did not stop you from liking to talk and move around. Now that we are liberated, you should be even more at ease. I hope you will abandon all worries, cultivate the habit of criticism and self-criticism, and further liberate yourself ideologically! Take out your heart and give it to the Party, express your heartfelt feelings with a thousand words, and let us work together to move forward! Your Fifth Sister

### 千言万语诉衷情

    千言万语诉衷情
    蓝凤亲爱的二嫂：
    一提起笔，我的心就立时飞向故乡，飞到你的身边。故乡是快到“暮春三月，江南草长，杂花生树，群莺乱飞”的时候了，今天又是星期天，你带着孩子们踏青去了吧？放风筝了吗？真叫人神往！
    在北方，此刻虽然春寒料峭，但是人们心头却早就春暖花开了。这心头的春意，是“整风”赐予的。整风，是一把熊熊的火，燃烧出了每个人的热情和智慧，连家庭妇女也不例外。在街道居民整风会议上，我听到了许多大姊从心底里发出来的声音。为着要让我们的一切工作做得更好，从开门七件事一直到国家大事，她们都热烈地提出意见，辩论着，史无前例地同干部一样把握住了批评和自我批评的武器。
    但是，也还有极少数的姊妹神情淡漠，发言很少，甚至一言不发。听二哥来信说，你在家乡的街道居民整风会议上的表现，也是这样。这真使我难过。你，还有这少数的姊妹，为什么这么不热心呢？
    你一定会说：“不是不热心，是没啥可说呀！”真没啥可说吗？不会的。你想，对于家里的事、家人的事、孩子的事、自己的事，不是永远都有无数的话可以说的么？为什么呢？这是因为自己是家庭中的主人之一，自己又是自身的主人，因此对于所属的一切都经心着，那怕非常细小琐屑，也不会漏掉。可见，要是把这主人翁的感觉也放到家庭、自己以外的人和事物上去，也就有话可说了。家庭妇女是不是也是我们国家、我们社会的主人翁之一呢？你当然知道是的。是主人翁，而不去行使主人翁的权利，不尽主人翁的义务，岂不是自暴自弃？况且，这整风的内容极其广泛丰富，包括着本来就为各个家庭、个人所关心的各项切身事情的。
    有主人翁的感觉了，关心了，有话可说了，可就是有点“说不出口”，一来怕说错，二来怕伤感情，是吗？我说二嫂，别怕这怕那的，只要我们自己站得正，真心为别人好，为大家好，就什么话都可以说，都该说。要是不说，又怎么知道自己所思所想是对是错？错了就改正，自己因此也提高了一步。别人要是见怪，那是别人不对，再接再厉提意见，纠正他，直到大家都想通都正确才止。如果当面不说背后说，或是把话搁在肚里成个疙瘩，那倒真会伤感情呢！
    二嫂呀，你记不记得，我俩个从前在一起的时候，常常彻夜长谈，连白天做活或玩儿的时候，也总是谈个没完没结。除了谈自己，也谈别人，东家长、西家短。世上许多事情都能引起我们的兴趣，都会成为我们的话题。你是那样的乐观开朗、坦率爽直，旧社会的种种束缚，都没有禁住了你的好说好动，在解放了的今天，更应该如鱼得水了。愿你抛弃一切顾虑，养成批评和自我批评的习惯，把自己进一步从思想上解放出来吧！掏出心来，交给党，千言万语诉衷情，让我们携手共同前进！　五妹上
