    Strive for Iron Output by Next Year's National Day
    Construction Begins on Baogang's No. 1 Blast Furnace
    Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 8th – The earthwork project for Baotou Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 large-scale automated blast furnace officially commenced on the 8th.

    On the morning of the 8th, in a sandy area of the Baogang iron smelting zone, mechanical operators started up scrapers and bulldozers, and workers inserted shovels into the sand to begin digging foundation pits for the blast furnace, hot blast stove, stock bin trestle, and other projects. Leading comrades from the Baotou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Baogang General Company, as well as Soviet experts, came to break ground with the workers.

    Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace is currently the largest blast furnace under construction in our country. In order to ensure that this blast furnace produces iron by next year's National Day, the workers and staff of Baogang broke ground as soon as the construction drawings for the blast furnace foundation project arrived. They are determined to strive to start pouring the concrete foundation more than two months ahead of the original plan. Not far from the iron smelting zone, the earthwork project of the coke chemical plant and the construction and installation projects of several workshops in the machinery repair area are underway. The workers and staff building the Bayan Obo iron mine are blasting rocks and digging earth to build a large-scale primary ore crushing plant and a mine electric locomotive railway.

    These days, Baogang's workers and staff are working hard to prepare for the official commencement of the main projects. The construction organization design for more than one hundred projects this year has been mostly completed, thousands of skilled workers have learned a second skill, technicians have reviewed the drawings, and several batches of personnel have gone to the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site to study. Hundreds of large construction machines have been overhauled, and a large number of building materials and heavy construction machines are being transported to the construction site.

    争取明年国庆节出铁
    包钢一号高炉动工
    新华社包头8日电　包头钢铁公司一号大型自动化高炉的土方工程，8日正式动工。
    8日上午，在包钢炼铁区一片沙原上，机械手们发动起了铲运机、推土机，工人们把铁锹插进沙土里，开始为高炉、热风炉、料仓栈桥等工程挖掘基础坑。中共包头市委、包钢总公司的一些领导同志和苏联专家，都前来和工人们一起破土。
    包钢一号高炉是目前我国开始建设的最大的高炉。建设包钢的职工为了保证这座高炉明年国庆节出铁，在高炉基础工程施工图纸刚刚到达就破土动工。他们决心争取比原计划提前两个多月开始浇灌混凝土基础。离炼铁区不远，焦炭化学厂的土方工程和机械修理区几个车间的建筑安装工程，正在进行。建设白云鄂博铁矿山的职工，正为修建大型矿石初破碎厂和矿山电气机车铁路，在爆破岩石和挖土。
    这些日子，包钢职工们都在紧张地进行主体工程正式开工前的准备工作。今年一百多项工程的施工组织设计大部分已经作出，成千名技术工人学习了第二种技能，技术人员审核了图纸，并有几批人员到武钢工地学习。数百部大型施工机械都已检修完毕，大批建筑材料和重型施工机械正向工地运送。（附图片）
    河北省今年兴建二十五座高炉，这是正在宣化镇建设的两座年产四千吨的小高炉。
