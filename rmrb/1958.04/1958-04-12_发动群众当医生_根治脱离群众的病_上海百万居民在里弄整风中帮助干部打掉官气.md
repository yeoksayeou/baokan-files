    Mobilizing the Masses as Doctors: Curing the Disease of Estrangement from the Masses
    Shanghai's Millions of Residents Help Cadres Shed Bureaucratic Air in Neighborhood Rectification
    (Our Shanghai dispatch of April 11th) Reporter Lu Ying reports: In the recent month-long neighborhood rectification movement, the government departments and enterprises in Shanghai have received the criticism and supervision of millions of residents. Bureaucratic air is being rapidly eliminated, and state personnel are learning to adopt the working style of following the mass line.
    After the comprehensive launch of the Shanghai neighborhood rectification, concurrently with the major rectification and reform within the district-level organs in mid-March, Deputy Mayor Xu Jianguo and district heads led a contingent of tens of thousands of cadres deep into the city's nearly ten thousand neighborhoods, visiting homes, mobilizing residents to speak out freely, and boldly exposing the bureaucratic air and other shortcomings and errors of state personnel. Some leading cadres even wrote big-character posters criticizing their own work units on behalf of illiterate elderly residents on the spot. Just when a few police officers, shop assistants, and doctors sitting in their offices thought that residents wouldn't have much to say about their units, big-character posters exposing their bureaucracy flew in like snowflakes. Among the more than seventeen million big-character posters, a large portion consisted of residents criticizing the serious bureaucratic air of cadres in government organs and enterprises. This was unprecedented golden advice. Under the X-ray of the residents' big-character posters, the commercial, public security, municipal construction, health, and civil affairs departments of many districts saw the various ways in which state personnel were alienated from the masses' bureaucratic attitudes.
    As the residents' speaking out reached a climax, a massive wave of neighborhood rectification attacking bureaucracy from both inside and outside was immediately launched simultaneously at thousands of rectification sites and within organs throughout the city. Jiangning District organized cadres responsible for rectification from various functional departments and all district residents' committees, forming numerous supervision and rectification groups based on the classification of opinions expressed, to engage in "direct dialogue" and "close combat" on-site, jointly studying and deciding on rectification measures. This approach enabled the district to rectify hundreds of thousands of suggestions quickly and effectively. The housing repair department of Yimiao District adopted the approach of sending people to collect residents' opinions on-site while simultaneously directing more than sixty house repair shock teams to repair residents' houses, fixing more than five thousand problems such as broken houses, damaged water and electricity, and damaged drainage ditches in half a month. To regularly care for people's living conditions, this department decided to permanently establish the shock repair organization in the future. Many district functional department cadres and employees regarded the opinions expressed by residents as "each word is worth gold, each big-character poster is a heart," and based on these opinions, they first launched ideological debates within the organs. Public security personnel further clarified the major issue of who to rely on for dictatorship, and commercial work cadres clearly distinguished the fundamental difference between delivering goods to people's homes today and delivering goods as employees of capitalists in the old society. After these ideas of serving the people were clarified, responsible comrades or cadres of the criticized units went to the neighborhoods to apologize and make amends, or posted big-character posters and held residents' representative conferences to publicly examine themselves and submit their rectification measures to the residents for supervision and enforcement. State administrative personnel in the Changping Road area also held "heart-to-heart talks" with neighborhood residents. Zhu Xueming, the police station chief, examined his ten aspects of shortcomings in work, such as pushing, delaying, floating, scolding, being coarse, and negligent, and stated that all police officers in the station should make two to three hundred close friends among the residents. The measures taken by state personnel to resolutely eliminate bureaucratic air deeply moved millions of residents. An old retired worker, Wu Changlin, was so excited when he heard the sincere report of several cadres from the Yangpu District organs examining their bureaucratic style that he shouted on the spot: "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    Currently, countless joyful scenes of unprecedented close unity between cadres and residents have appeared in Shanghai's neighborhoods. Thousands of police officers are helping residents repair houses, build fire-resistant stoves, pave mud roads, and clear drainage ditches. Opinion boxes for police stations to connect with residents are visible everywhere on the streets and alleys. The Second Residents' Committee of Dongtai Road heard the cheers of housewives. It turned out that the police comrades had settled in the neighborhood. In neighborhoods such as Gaoyou Road, more than ten thousand residents beat gongs and drums, carrying congratulatory firecrackers and big-character posters to the nearby hospital of the Shanghai Electric Power Administration to thank them for accepting residents' opinions and breaking the convention of enterprise hospitals not providing medical treatment to residents, fulfilling the residents' long-standing desire to seek medical treatment nearby. An extremely popular saying is spreading among the vast residents: "Cadres have leaped forward and are like relatives to us. We must also leap forward and make more close friends with cadres."

    发动群众当医生　根治脱离群众的病
    上海百万居民在里弄整风中帮助干部打掉官气
    本报上海11日电　记者鲁影报道：上海市各区政府部门、企业单位在近一个月里弄整风运动中，得到了百万居民的批评和监督，官气正在迅速根治，国家工作人员都在学习走群众路线的工作作风。
    上海市里弄整风与各区机关内部大整大改同时在3月中旬全面展开以后，副市长许建国和各区区长带领了一支由数万干部组成的工作队伍深入到全市近万条里弄中去，登门拜访，发动居民大鸣大放，大胆揭发国家工作人员的官气和其他缺点、错误；有些领导干部还当场代不识字的年老居民写批评自己工作部门的大字报。正当少数坐在办公室整改的民警、商店营业员、医生认为居民不会对他们单位有多大意见的时候，揭发他们官僚主义的大字报好似雪片一样飞来，在一千七百多万张大字报中，居民批评政府机关和企业单位干部官气严重的内容占了很大一部分。这是从来也没有听到过的金玉良言。在居民大字报的X光透视下，许多区的商业、公安、市政建设、卫生、民政等部门看到了国家工作人员形形色色疏远群众的官气。
    随着居民鸣放高潮出现，一个内外夹攻官气的里弄整改巨浪，立即在全市成千个整改现场和机关内部一齐掀起。江宁区组织各业务部门负责整改的干部和全区居民委员会，根据鸣放意见的分类组成的许多督促整改小组“上下对口”，在现场面对面的“短兵相接”，共同研究决定整改措施，这种做法使该区数十万条意见改得又快，又好。邑庙区房屋修理部门采取一面派人分赴现场等收集居民意见，一面指挥六十多个修屋突击组，给居民修理房屋，半个月内修好了屋破、水电损坏、阴沟损坏等毛病五千多处；为了做到经常关心人民居住生活，这个部门决定今后把突击修屋组织固定起来。许多区业务部门干部、职工把居民鸣放的意见当作“一字一言一寸金，一张张大字报一颗心”来看待，并且根据这些意见首先在机关内部展开思想交锋。公安人员进一步明确了依靠谁专政的大问题，商业工作干部划清了今天送货上门和旧社会受资本家雇佣去送货上门的根本区别。这些为人民服务的思想澄清以后，被批评的单位负责同志或干部自己就到里弄上门道歉赔礼，或贴大字报、开居民代表大会当众检查，并向居民交出自己的整改措施，请求居民监督执行。昌平路地区的国家行政人员还在里弄居民中举行“交心大会”，派出所所长朱学明向居民检查自己工作中推、拖、浮、训、粗、怠等十方面没有全心为居民服务的毛病，并表示全所民警要在居民中交二百个到三百个知心朋友。国家工作人员采取这种种下决心打掉官气的措施，深深感动了千万个居民。一个退休老工人吴长林在听杨浦区机关几个干部诚恳检查自己官僚主义作风的报告时，当场激动得高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    当前，上海里弄中出现了无数幅干部和居民空前亲密团结的欢乐画图。千百个民警在帮助居民修屋、砌防火炉灶、铺泥路、通阴沟。大街小巷，公安派出所和居民联系的意见箱到处可见。东台路第二居民委员会传来了家庭主妇的欢呼声，原来是民警同志到里弄安家落户。在高邮路等里弄中，一万多居民锣鼓喧天，他们正带着贺喜的爆竹和大字报去送给附近的上海电业管理局的医院，感谢他们医院接受居民意见，打破企业医院不替居民看病的常规，使居民想就近看病的多年愿望得到实现。一句极为流行的话在广大居民中传告：“干部跃进了，和我们像亲人一样，我们也要跃进，和干部多交知心朋友”。
