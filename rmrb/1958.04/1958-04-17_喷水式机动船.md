    Water-Jet Propelled Motorboat
    A "water-jet propelled motorboat," successfully trial-assembled from a water pump used for irrigation together with an engine, is a significant contribution to agricultural production. This boat was trial-assembled by the staff of the Zhejiang Water Pump Factory in Haimen, Zhejiang, and other units, under the call of the Party Committee, displaying collective wisdom and painstakingly researching. It involves mounting the water pump and engine on a manually operated boat, running the suction pipe through the bottom of the boat, and positioning the outlet pipe at the stern, using motorized power and water ejection as propulsion for travel. Trial runs on the 4th showed a speed of over twenty li per hour. The masses call it a "jet-propelled boat." It can not only be used for transportation and mobile water pumping, but also for milling rice, grinding bran, etc. Since the water pump is a machine already set up by the agricultural cooperative, only some installation costs are required. They have now proposed to assemble two hundred boats in April to support the urgent transportation needs of agriculture. (Min Wen)

    喷水式机动船
    一艘由抽水用的水泵连同引擎试装成功的“喷水式机动船”，对农业生产来说是一个重大的贡献。这艘船是由浙江海门的浙江水泵厂等单位的职工，在党委的号召下发挥集体智慧，苦心钻研试装成功的。它是将水泵连同引擎装在人力船上，把吸水管串通船底，出水管架在船尾，以机动和射水为动力进行行驶，4日试驶结果每小时速度有二十多里。群众称它为“喷气式船”。它不但可以运输，流动抽水，而且还可用来打米、打糠等。由于抽水机是农业社已有设置的机械，只要花些安装费用就行了。现在他们提出要在4月份装好二百艘支援农业上迫切的运输需要。（敏文）
