    Two Hubei Special Districts Raise Funds to Develop Phosphate Mine
    (Our Dispatch) The Xiangyang and Jingzhou Special Districts of Hubei Province are jointly raising funds to cooperate in the development of the phosphate mine in Zhongxiang County. The mining site is located in Zhubao埠, Zhongxiang County. The phosphate ore here is of very high grade and can be directly used as fertilizer after being ground into phosphate rock powder without the need for ore dressing. It is also suitable for open-pit mining. Currently, the two special districts have transferred 400 staff and workers to carry out large-scale mining. They plan to mine 30,000 to 40,000 tons of phosphate ore this year. Some of the phosphate ore will be mechanically ground, and some will be directly handed over to agricultural cooperatives to grind themselves into phosphate rock powder for fertilizer.
    The phosphate mine in Zhongxiang County is a huge phosphate mine, estimated to have reserves of 600 to 700 million tons. The phosphate ore is of high grade, and the mining area has convenient transportation. The Ministry of Chemical Industry and Hubei Province have decided to build two phosphate mines here for large-scale exploitation to supply the needs of chemical fertilizer plants nationwide for manufacturing phosphate fertilizer.

    湖北两个专区集资开磷矿
    本报讯　湖北省襄阳专区和荆州专区集资合作开采锺祥县的磷矿。开采的地点在锺祥县的朱堡埠，这个地方的磷矿品位很高，不经过选矿就可以制成磷矿粉直接肥田，并且适合露天开采。目前这两个专区已抽调四百多职工在大规模开采，计划今年开采三万到四万吨磷矿，这些磷矿一部分采取机械磨碎，一部分将直接交由农业社自己磨碎制成磷矿粉作肥料。
    锺祥县的磷矿是一个巨大的磷矿，估计磷矿储量有六亿到七亿吨，磷矿品位高，矿区交通便利。中央化工部和湖北省已确定在这里兴建两个磷矿进行大量开采，供应全国化肥厂制造磷肥的需要。	　（张冠五）
