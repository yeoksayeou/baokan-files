Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: The Ministry of Culture today notified the Culture Bureaus (Departments) of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, and all directly affiliated theaters (troupes) of the Ministry of Culture to learn from the practice of the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe in performing on city streets.

The notice pointed out that street plays and street performances are a glorious tradition of revolutionary literature and art. The street plays and square Yangko operas performed during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War promptly reflected the actual struggles of the time, were lively in form, and flexible in performance, fully playing the fighting role of revolutionary literature and art.

The notice said that after the national liberation, although square performances in rural areas have been preserved, street performances in cities, except for the celebration of major festivals, have been rarely seen. The Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe, in cooperation with drama workers, has promptly created and rehearsed new dramas that coordinate with political movements and performed them on the streets, which should attract the attention and importance of all localities.

The notice requires all professional art performance groups across the country, if their own conditions permit, to create and rehearse more short, concise, and diverse new programs reflecting real life, and to take out a certain amount of time to perform in city streets in a planned way (or in joint performances with other art units and art academies), so that revolutionary literature and art can meet with workers, peasants, and the broad masses of working people more and faster, and conduct socialist ideological education for them in a timely manner.

    文化部号召全国艺术团体
    发扬街头演出的战斗传统
    新华社29日讯　文化部今天通知各省、市、自治区文化局（厅）和文化部各直属剧院（团）学习杭州越剧团在城市街头进行演出的做法。
    通知指出，街头剧、街头演出是革命文艺的光荣传统，抗日战争和解放战争时期演出的街头剧、广场秧歌剧都及时反映了当时的实际斗争，形式活泼，演出灵便，充分发挥了革命文艺的战斗作用。
    通知说，全国解放后，农村的广场演出虽然还保存下来，城市街头的演出除了庆祝重大节日以外，就很少见到了。杭州越剧团同话剧工作者合作，及时编排配合政治运动的新剧目并在街头演出，应引起各地的注意和重视。
    通知中要求全国所有的专业艺术表演团体，如本身条件可能，应多创作排演一些短小精悍多种多样的反映现实生活新节目，抽出一定时间，有计划地在城市街头演出（或同别的艺术单位和艺术院校联合演出），使革命文艺更多、更快地同工人、农民和广大劳动人民见面，对他们及时进行社会主义思想教育。
