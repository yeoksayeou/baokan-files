    *Miscanthus sinensis* is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows mostly on barren hillsides. It is widely distributed and produced in large quantities in China. It grows particularly densely in Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou and other regions, sometimes covering entire mountain ranges for several miles. According to preliminary tests, *Miscanthus sinensis* generally contains about 56% cellulose, which is about 11% more than wood, 20% more than rice straw, and 13% more than sugarcane residue. *Miscanthus sinensis* fibers are thin and long, making them a good raw material for manufacturing high-grade paper. The Hubei Paper Mill uses 100% *Miscanthus sinensis* to produce offset printing paper and carbon copy paper, which are very popular with users. In 1957, Sichuan, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Hubei and other four provinces purchased more than one million dan of *Miscanthus sinensis*, most of which was supplied for papermaking. At the beginning of this year, Santai County in Sichuan Province used *Miscanthus sinensis* to trial-produce rayon. Every 100 jin of *Miscanthus sinensis* can produce 80 jin of rayon. The quality of the rayon produced is very good, and the cost is half the price of cotton. This kind of rayon can be woven into beautiful towels, gloves, socks, etc. Initial estimates indicate that Sichuan Province alone produces about two million dan of *Miscanthus sinensis* annually. If all of it is utilized, it can produce 1.6 million dan of rayon, equivalent to the output of four million mu of cotton fields.

    龙须草
    龙须草是多年生草本植物，多生长在荒山坡上，在我国生长分布很广，产量很大。特别是在四川、广西、贵州等地区，生长较集中，有的地区整个山岭都是，往往连绵数里。据初步化验：龙须草一般含纤维素56％左右，约比木材多11％，比稻草多20％，比甘蔗渣多13％。龙须草纤维细而长，是制造高级用纸的一种好原料。湖北纸厂用百分之百的龙须草制造的胶版印刷纸，复写原纸等很受用户欢迎。1957年四川、广西、陕西、湖北等四省即收购龙须草一百多万担，大部分是供应造纸。今年初，四川省三台县利用龙须草试制成人造棉，每百斤龙须草可产人造棉八十斤。所造的棉花质量很好，且成本相当于棉花价的二分之一。用这种棉花并能织成美观的手巾、手套、袜子等。仅四川省初步估计年产龙须草约二百万担，如全部利用起来，可产棉花一百六十万担，相当于四百万亩棉田的产量。
