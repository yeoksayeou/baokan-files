	Get Out of the Office!
	Yuan Qing
	The office is undoubtedly an indispensable place, one of the important venues upon which the superstructure relies to carry out its work. It is impossible to imagine that we can build socialism well without the work in the office, without the necessary materials, documents, instructions, plans...
	However, the question is: how can we guarantee the correctness of plans, instructions, and decisions? Is it enough to just sit in the office and read materials and documents? Obviously, some of our comrades have a kind of superstition on this issue. They seem to think that "the office is omnipotent," that the office itself can produce miracles, and are not interested in the good "air and sunshine" outside, and do not go to contact the boiling struggle of the workers and peasants. They go from the dormitory to the office when they go to work, and from the office to the dormitory when they get off work. They really seem to have the momentum of not looking at the affairs of the masses with both eyes, and only focusing on the papers.
	Is this okay? Of course not.
	Today, the nature of our country determines that we cannot isolate the office from battlefields such as factories and rural areas. Our country is a country led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. It requires its staff (including leaders) to serve the working people wholeheartedly. In order to serve the working people, we must first and foremost often be familiar with the working people, familiar with their lives and struggles, understand their demands and wishes, care about their pain, and understand their feelings. We must often discover, summarize, and promote advanced things among them, and promote the development of the entire revolutionary cause and productive forces. If we always confine ourselves to an office of a few or dozens of square meters, and are "not diligent in our limbs and do not distinguish the five grains," and are not familiar with the objects we serve at all, then we cannot talk about serving the people, let alone serve them well.
	Moreover, revolutionary practice is constantly developing. With the great victory of the socialist revolution, and with the in-depth development of the rectification movement, our country is currently in a situation of revolutionary great leap forward. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people is soaring to the sky, and they are rapidly changing the face of the motherland with vigorous creativity. Taking water conservancy as an example, in the past four months, more than 200 million mu of irrigated land have been opened up across the country, which is more than the irrigated land opened up in the past thousands of years before liberation (240 million mu). The development of things is so rapid that it often exceeds expectations. If the staff of the organs, especially the leading cadres, still "live in a small room," it will be difficult to adapt to the rapidly developing revolutionary situation, and there is a danger of being thrown behind the revolutionary train. The leaders of an oil factory in Hebei Province sat in the office and answered the opinions of the masses, and could answer more than 100 items in an hour. A worker wrote a big-character poster titled "Elevator Dancing," criticizing the elevator for being unstable and swinging back and forth after driving. The leader actually replied: "No one is allowed to dance while driving. This is a violation of labor discipline and should be educated." It seems that this leader is too attached to and "superstitious" about his office, so that he made this irrelevant joke. Although this is a relatively individual phenomenon, is it not enough to illustrate the danger of sticking to the office and being divorced from reality? The situation is pressing, and it is time to fundamentally break the "superstition" and get out of the office! Only by making our work methods a leap forward, innovating and creating new work methods, going to the grassroots, going to the masses, linking with reality, understanding the wishes and requirements of the masses, and walking in front of the mass movement, can we effectively lead the movement.
	However, it is said that some comrades cannot get out of their offices all year round because they are "busy." For many comrades working in organs, especially leaders, "busy" is indeed a fact. There are many things to do, and many things must be done, so the office does not need to be empty all the time. However, if a leader cannot leave his office all year round, then we must first study whether he is busy with bureaucracy and red tape? If these isms are causing trouble, they should be resolutely rectified. Secondly, it is necessary to study in particular whether "busy" is due to not being able to distinguish the priorities of work and not being able to grasp the main contradictions and key issues in the work. Of course, the main contradictions and key issues of various organs and different periods of the same organ are not exactly the same, but in general, the common problem that organs are prone to make is to be divorced from reality and the masses, and the common direction that the organs should strive for is mainly to link with reality and the masses. If we are "busy" and divorced from reality and the masses, then we are not "busy" in the right place, and we should correct the direction, get out of the office, go to the grassroots, and go to the masses. Chairman Mao has set an example for us of frequently going deep into the masses and going deep into reality. With his extremely busy state affairs, he can still come and go freely. According to incomplete reports in newspapers in recent months, the Chairman has inspected the sanitation work in Xiaoying Lane in Hangzhou, and has been to the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the Guangxi Nanning Nationalities Institute and other places. Why is it so easy for the Chairman to get out of his office, while it is so difficult for some of our comrades? This is a question worth pondering. It seems that whether or not one can leave the office is not fundamentally a matter of "busy," but a matter of ideology and working methods. If we learn from the Chairman and many other outstanding comrades in the Party, learn from their revolutionary ideas of loving the people and trusting and valuing the wisdom and creativity of the people, and learn from their vigorous mass line leadership methods and work style, we will be able to find enough time to get out of our offices.
	The purpose of getting out of the office is to go to the masses and go to practice. Recently, various places have found and are vigorously promoting various vivid working methods for going deep into reality and the masses, such as planting experimental fields, visiting, comparing, exhibitions, on-site meetings, and grasping both ends. Among them, the most valuable is the working method of planting experimental fields, which can enable cadres to truly go to the masses to lead the masses. At the same time, many county-level organs, in order to better approach reality, approach the people, and lead the great leap forward in production, have also moved their offices to the scene. These practices embody the great leap forward in the ideological style and working methods of the leadership, and have also given the concept of the office a new development. These "open-air offices" should be vigorously promoted. Of course, these invisible open-air offices cannot replace ordinary offices. But they have laid the widest and most reliable foundation for the offices of leading organs at all levels. Because only by going deep into the masses and going deep into reality in this way can we better study the materials and documents from all aspects, can we guarantee the correctness of the plans, instructions, and decisions in the office, and can we do our work more, faster, better, and more economically.
	Chairman Mao often taught us: Any hero or heroine, his thoughts, opinions, plans, and methods can only be a reflection of the objective world, and his raw materials or semi-finished products can only come from the practice of the people or his own scientific experiments. His mind can only function as a processing plant to produce finished products, otherwise it is of no use at all. Whether the finished product made by the human brain is suitable or not, and whether it is correct or not, must be tested by the people.
	These words should become the motto in our office. To meet the needs of the great leap forward in agriculture, higher agricultural education takes new measures. The National Higher Agricultural Education Conference closes.
	According to Xinhua News Agency, the National Higher Agricultural Education Conference, which closed on March 25, focused on discussing the further implementation of the policy of combining education, scientific research, and production, and vigorously cultivating agricultural technical talents who are both red and expert.
	The meeting believes that in order to adapt to the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, schools must take some new measures in enrollment, professional settings, curriculum arrangements, and teaching content. Schools should generally expand enrollment tasks, enroll a large number of students with worker and peasant backgrounds, hold training courses for veteran cadres, and improve the professional level of leaders at the county (section) level of the agricultural and reclamation system; they should also train a sufficient number of teachers. Schools are also preparing to add majors such as agronomy, farmland water conservancy, animal husbandry, fruit and vegetable, agricultural machinery, soil, sericulture, and tea. In terms of curriculum arrangements, it is necessary to combine with the agricultural season, and take measures such as on-site teaching, shortening winter and summer vacations and examination time, so that students generally have three or four months to participate in labor production. In terms of teaching content, it is necessary to emphasize the systematic explanation of the agricultural status quo and development prospects of the province and region. Teachers and students should select base points in the local rural areas as internship places, and conduct theoretical research starting from solving practical production problems, in order to improve the scientific and technological level of teaching. This meeting was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture and lasted nine days.

    走出办公室！
    远青
    办公室，无疑是不可缺少的地方，它是上层建筑赖以进行工作的重要场所之一。不可能设想：没有办公室里的工作，没有必要的资料、文件、指示、计划……，我们可以很好地建设社会主义。
    但是，问题在于：我们如何才能保证计划、指示、决定的正确性？光靠坐办公室看资料看文件，行不行？显然，在这个问题上，我们有些同志是存在着一种迷信的。他们似乎以为“办公室万能”，以为办公室本身就可以产生出什么奇迹，而对室外大好的“空气阳光”不感兴趣，对工农群众沸腾的斗争不去接触，上班从宿舍到办公室，下班从办公室到宿舍。真是大有两眼不看群众事，一心只顾蛀公文之势。
    这样行不行呢？当然不行。
    今天我们国家的性质就决定我们不能把办公室和工厂、农村等战场隔离起来。我们国家是以无产阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的国家，它要求自己的工作人员（包括领导人）全心全意为劳动人民服务，而为了给劳动人民服务，我们就必须首先而且经常地熟悉劳动人民，熟悉他们的生活和斗争，了解他们的要求和愿望，关心他们的痛痒，懂得他们的心情，就必须经常地发现、总结、推广他们中的先进事物，促进整个革命事业和生产力的发展。如果我们老是把自己关在十几或几十平方公尺的办公室里，“四体不勤，五谷不分”，根本不熟悉自己服务的对象，那就谈不上什么为人民服务，更不可能服务得好。
    何况，革命实践总是在不断发展着的，随着社会主义革命的伟大胜利，随着整风运动的深入开展，目前我国已处在革命大跃进的形势之下，劳动人民的革命干劲冲天，他们正以旺盛的创造力飞速地改变着祖国的面貌。就以水利来说，最近四个多月来，全国共开辟了两亿多万亩水地，比解放前几千年中开辟的水地（二亿四千万亩）还多。事情的发展竟是这样的神速，常常出人意料，如果机关工作人员特别是领导干部依然“身居斗室”，那就难以适应飞跃发展的革命形势，有被抛在革命列车后面的危险。河北省有个油厂的领导人，坐在办公室里答复群众的意见，一小时能答一百多条。一个工人写了一篇题名“升降机跳舞”的大字报，批评升降机安装的不稳固，开车后来回摆动，这位领导人竟回答说：“谁也不许开着车跳舞，这是违犯劳动纪律的现象，应加教育。”看来，这位领导人太留恋和“迷信”自己的办公室了，以致闹出这个牛头不对马嘴的笑话。这虽然是比较个别的现象，但还不足以说明死守办公室脱离实际的危险性吗？形势咄咄逼人，是根本打破“迷信”、走出办公室的时候了！只有使我们的工作方法也来一个跃进，革新和创造新的工作方法，到基层去，到群众中去，联系实际，了解群众的愿望和要求，走到群众运动的前头，我们才能有力地领导运动。
    可是，据说有些同志是由于“忙”，经年走不出自己的办公室。对很多机关工作同志尤其是领导人来说，“忙”确是事实。事情很多，有许多事情又非办不可，所以并不需要办公室经常都是空空的。但是，如果一个领导人整年离不开自己的办公室，那我们首先就要研究一下，是不是忙于事务主义和文牍主义？如果是由于这些主义作怪，那就应当坚决把它们整掉。其次，要特别研究一下，“忙”是不是由于分不清工作的轻重缓急，在工作中抓不住主要矛盾和关键问题。当然，各个机关和同一机关的各个不同时期，主要矛盾和关键问题是不完全相同的，但一般说来，机关工作容易犯的通病就是脱离实际、脱离群众，而机关工作所应努力的共同方向，也主要是联系实际、联系群众。如果我们“忙”得脱离了实际和群众，那就是没有“忙”在正当地方，应该端正方向，走出办公室，到基层去，到群众中去。毛主席为我们树立了经常深入群众深入实际的典范。他以国务十分繁忙之身，尚能来去自如，据近几月来报纸上不完全的刊载，主席就查看过杭州小营巷的卫生工作，到过浙江农业科学研究所，到过广西南宁民族学院等地方。为什么主席走出自己的办公室那么容易，而我们有些同志却很困难呢？这是一个值得深思的问题。看来，能不能离开办公室，根本问题不是什么“忙”的问题，而是思想问题和工作方法问题。如果我们向主席和党内其他很多优秀同志学习，学习他们热爱人民和信任、珍贵人民智慧和创造力的革命思想，学习他们那种生气勃勃的群众路线的领导方法和工作作风，我们就能够找到足够的时间走出自己的办公室。
    走出办公室的目的，是到群众中去，到实践中去。最近各地已找到了和正在大力推广着各种各样的深入实际、深入群众的生动的工作方法，如种试验田、参观、评比、展览、现场会议、抓两头等等。其中特别宝贵的是种试验田的工作方法，可以使干部真正到群众中去领导群众。同时，有很多县级机关，为了更好地接近实际，接近人民，领导生产大跃进，把他们的办公室也搬到现场去了。这些作法，体现了领导的思想作风、工作方法的大跃进，也使办公室的概念得到了新的发展。应当大力提倡这些“露天的办公室”。当然，这些无形的露天的办公室，并不能代替一般的办公室。但它们为各级领导机关的办公室扎下了最广泛而最可靠的根子。因为只有这样地深入群众，深入实际，我们才有可能更好地研究各方面来的资料和文件，才有可能保证办公室里的计划、指示、决定的正确性，才有可能把工作做得更多更快更好更省一些。
    毛主席经常教导我们说：任何英雄豪杰，他的思想、意见、计划、办法，只能是客观世界的反映，其原料或者半成品只能来自人民群众的实践中，或者自己的科学试验中，他的头脑只能作为一个加工工厂而起制成完成品的作用，否则是一点用处也没有的。人脑制成的这种完成品，究竟合用不合用，正确不正确，还得交由人民群众去考验。
    这些话，应当成为我们办公室里的座右铭。适应农业大跃进需要高等农业教育采取新措施全国高等农业教育会议闭幕
    据新华社讯　3月25日闭幕的全国高等农业教育会议，着重讨论了进一步贯彻教育、科学研究和生产相结合的方针，大力培养又红又专的农业技术人材问题。
    会议认为，为适应农业生产大跃进的形势，各校的招生、专业的设置、课程的安排、教学内容等都要采取一些新的措施。各校一般要扩大招生任务，大量招收工农成分的学生，举办老干部进修班，提高农业和农垦系统县（科）级领导干部的业务水平；还要培养足够数量的教师。各校还准备分别增设农学、农田水利、畜牧、果树蔬菜、农业机械、土壤、蚕桑、茶叶等专业。在课程的安排上，要与农事季节相结合，采取现场教学、缩短寒假、暑假和考试时间等办法，使学生一般有三、四个月时间参加劳动生产。在教学内容方面，要强调系统的讲解本省、本地区的农业现状和发展远景。教师和学生要在当地的农村中选择基点作为实习场所，从解决生产实际问题出发，进行理论性研究，以提高教学的科学技术水平。这次会议是农业部召开的，历时九天。
