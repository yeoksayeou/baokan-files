Heilongjiang State Farms Sow Spring Wheat

(Our report) The spring plowing production of all state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of the motherland, has begun in full swing, with more than a thousand tractors dispatched to sow spring wheat.

In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production, an unprecedented new atmosphere has emerged in the state-owned farms of Heilongjiang Province. The more than sixty farms under the Heilongjiang Provincial Farm Management Bureau have accumulated over 500,000 tons of fertilizer, with over 400,000 tons already delivered to the fields. By the time of sowing in the large fields, the amount of manure applied by the farms will exceed 700,000 tons, equivalent to four times the amount of fertilizer applied last year; in addition to chemical fertilizers, the fertilizer application area on this year's 230,000 hectares of land will exceed 90%, which is unprecedented in past years. Most of the more than 20,000 tons of seeds needed by the farms have been carefully selected, and all of the spring wheat seeds, which account for 50% of the sown area, are high-quality varieties adapted to the local climate. The farms have also extensively and deeply carried out a technical innovation movement, the most important of which at present is to change the past flat cultivation of inter-tilled crops to ridge cultivation. The farms have modified their sowing machines so that they can perform ridging and sowing simultaneously using machinery. This closely combines mechanized production with the inherent production experience of the local farmers. Many farms have also made full use of the internal water resources of the farms, expanding the area of rice paddies from 9,700 hectares last year to 13,500 hectares. (Ding Luxu)

    黑龙江国营农场播种春麦
    本报讯　祖国最北方的黑龙江省所有国营农场的春耕生产已经全面开始，一千多台拖拉机正出动播种春小麦。
    在生产大跃进的高潮中，黑龙江省国营农场出现了空前未有的新气象。省农场管理厅所属的六十多个农场，积肥已超过五十万吨，送到地里的达到四十万吨以上。到播种大田时，各场送粪施肥可超过七十万吨，相当于去年施肥的四倍；加上化学肥料，在今年播种的二十三万公顷土地上，施肥面积超过90％，这是过去历年来从没有的，各场所需的二万多吨种子，已大部分精选完毕，占播种面积50％的春小麦种子，全部是适应当地气候特点的优良品种。各场还广泛深入地开展了技术革新运动，当前最主要的是对中耕作物改过去的平作为垅作。各场把播种机改装，都可以作到使用机械起垅与播种同时进行。这就使机械化生产和当地农民固有的生产经验密切结合起来。许多场还充分利用场内水利资源，使水稻面积由去年的九千七百公顷扩大为一万三千五百公顷。（丁履枢）
