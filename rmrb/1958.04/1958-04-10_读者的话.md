    Reader's Words
    Cancel Unreasonable Royalties
    In recent years, with the continuous development of China's scientific undertakings, the number of academic journals has been increasing. However, there are unreasonable phenomena in terms of royalties. As far as I know, many articles published in journals such as "Journal of Fuel Chemistry and Technology" and "Science Bulletin" are rewritten from work summaries or work reports. These are the results of research work for which the state has spent a lot of money, and they are also the achievements of many people's labor. Strangely, some people publish these articles in publications in their own names, and at the same time, they receive a considerable amount of royalties, truly gaining both fame and fortune! I think this is a reflection of bourgeois ideology and an unhealthy trend, which should be stopped quickly.
    I suggest that all publishing departments and journal editorial departments make the following regulation: articles rewritten from work summaries or work reports should not be paid royalties. Hai Ke
    Don't Damage Communication Lines When Hunting Sparrows
    The cable communication lines of our department have had two accidents in two years in which birdshot penetrated the core wires. Thirty pairs of lead-sheathed cables failed in April 1956 and were not detected until June of last year; twenty pairs of lead-sheathed cables failed in July of last year and were not repaired until March of this year. These two accidents caused the state to lose about one thousand yuan, and more seriously, affected communication work. We hope that everyone will not shoot at communication lines when hunting sparrows; at the same time, we suggest that relevant units strengthen education to the masses in this regard.

    取消不合理的稿酬
    近年来，由于我国科学事业的不断发展，学术性的期刊种类愈来愈多了。但是，在稿酬方面存在着不合理的现象。据我所知，刊载在“燃料学报”、“科学通报”等期刊上的许多文章，都是工作总结或工作报告改写成的，这些都是国家花了很多钱进行研究工作得出的结果，同时也是许多人的劳动成果。奇怪的是有些人却以个人名义把这些文章在刊物上发表出来，同时，他们还会收到一笔数目不小的稿酬，真是名利双收！我觉得这是一种资产阶级思想的反映，是一股歪风，应该很快制止。
    我建议各出版部门、期刊编辑部作出这样一个规定：凡是以工作总结或工作报告改写成的文章，不付给稿费。　海　克
    打麻雀不要损坏通信线路
    我们部的电缆通信线路，在两年里连续发生两次被鸟枪弹射入心线内的事故。有三十对铅包电缆在1956年4月发生故障，直到去年6月才被检查出来；有二十对铅包电缆，在去年7月发生故障，到今年3月才修复。这两次事故使国家损失一千元左右，更严重的是影响了通信工作。我们希望大家在打麻雀的时候，不要射在通信线路上；同时建议有关单位在这方面对群众加强教育。
