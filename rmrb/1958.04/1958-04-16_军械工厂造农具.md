Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Many ordnance repair factories and naval shipyard units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are, based on their respective equipment and technical capabilities, accepting state orders to manufacture diesel engines, water pumps, steam engines, double-铧 plows, single-铧 plows, and well-drilling tools, vigorously supporting agricultural production. Among them, small universal tractors and three-horsepower automatic walking plows successfully trial-produced by two ordnance repair factories have been inspected by local agricultural technology departments and deemed to have good efficiency. They will be manufactured in batches for use by agricultural cooperatives.

The repair departments of various specialized military branches are also helping tractor stations in their stationed areas to repair tractors. Some units have also sent technical personnel to repair agricultural tools for agricultural cooperatives. The military workers of a repair company of a certain tank unit are rushing to produce a batch of plowshares and track pins for the local tractor station.

    军械工厂造农具
    据新华社讯　中国人民解放军许多军械修理工厂和海军部队的修船厂，按照各自的设备和技术能力，正在接受国家的订货，制造柴油机、抽水机、锅驼机、双铧犁、单铧犁和打井工具等，大力支援农业生产。其中两个军械修理工厂试制成功的小型万能拖拉机和三马力的自动步犁，经当地农业技术部门检验后，认为效能较好，将成批制造供农业社使用。
    各特种兵部队的修械部门，也分别帮助驻地的拖拉机站检修了拖拉机，有的单位还派出技术人员为农业社修理农具。某坦克部队修理连的军工，正在给当地的拖拉机站赶制一批犁铧和履带梢等机件。
