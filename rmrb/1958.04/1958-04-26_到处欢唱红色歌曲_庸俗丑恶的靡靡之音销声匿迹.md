Xinhua News Agency, April 25th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Lei reports: The mass struggle to eliminate yellow music, which began at the end of last year, has achieved significant victories in recent months. Songs full of socialist revolutionary enthusiasm and drive are sung everywhere, and vulgar and ugly yellow music has disappeared. In all public places, people can no longer hear the decadent sounds of those yellow songs. A large number of new song sheets printed with exquisite colorful pictures are popular; in Shenyang and Beijing alone, four to five million copies have been sold. Those once rampant yellow song sheets have long been spurned by the people and have become waste paper. The national socialist singing movement is flourishing, and thousands upon thousands of mass singing organizations have emerged across the country, establishing strong red music positions in factories, rural areas, government offices, and schools.

Last year, in the storm of the bourgeois rightists' attack on the Party and socialism, reactionary yellow music that praised the ugly souls of the bourgeoisie, taking advantage of the arrogance of its masters' offensive, flooded more than 20 provinces and cities across the country. Nearly a hundred yellow songs that were popular in the old society, such as "Drizzling Rain," "Night Shanghai," and "When Will You Return," made a comeback and were appreciated and spread by those who were infatuated with the bourgeois lifestyle, pulling some people influenced by bourgeois ideology backward, and also ruthlessly attacking the pure working class and student ranks.

With the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, various activities against yellow music were launched successively in more than 20 provinces and cities last year. Fifty-eight units in Tianjin, including musical performance groups, theaters, and cultural centers, signed a covenant to eradicate yellow music and promote socialist new singing, supervising each other and leaving no place for yellow songs. Lectures and reports against yellow music were widely held throughout the country. The Central Philharmonic Orchestra in Beijing also organized a "shock team" to eliminate yellow music, going deep into more than 30 grassroots units such as factories, schools, and government offices, holding lively and comparative reports criticizing yellow music, so that everyone could clearly feel the vulgarity and ugliness of yellow music from the comparison, and develop a strong love for red music. Shenyang held "training classes for dance accompanists" to guide the selection and performance of dance accompaniment music. In addition, "popular music concerts" were held to actively disseminate healthy songs that were easily accepted by the masses. The district cultural center in Changchun established broadcasting points in factories, shops, and streets, and carried out propaganda to eliminate yellow music on a large scale through loudspeakers. Shenyang, Changsha, and other places printed a large number of new song sheets to resist the popularity of yellow song sheets.

Trade unions and Communist Youth Leagues in Sichuan, Hunan, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, and other places actively cooperated with the struggle to eliminate yellow music, carrying out extensive ideological education to the masses. A large number of articles and letters from the masses published in newspapers and magazines across the country severely criticized yellow music, showing the people's disgust and indignation towards yellow music after their political consciousness was raised.

In order to completely eliminate the influence of yellow music among the masses, the work of criticizing yellow music will continue to be carried out in depth in conjunction with the development of the socialist singing movement in the future. Report meetings and concerts will be held in more grassroots units, and red song sheets will be printed frequently and in large quantities. Recently, the Chinese Musicians Association established a yellow music criticism group, preparing to publish a "Yellow Music Criticism Collection," on the one hand, to organize special articles to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois revisionist thought in the music circle, and on the other hand, to write short articles to solve some of the masses' questions and confused thoughts about eliminating yellow music, so as to improve their socialist consciousness from the musical art aspect.

### 到处欢唱红色歌曲  庸俗丑恶的靡靡之音销声匿迹

    到处欢唱红色歌曲
    庸俗丑恶的靡靡之音销声匿迹
    新华社25日讯　新华社记者续磊报道：从去年年底开始发展起来的群众性的肃清黄色音乐的斗争，几个月来已经获得重大胜利。充满社会主义革命热情和干劲的歌声到处欢唱着，庸俗丑恶的黄色音乐已经销声匿迹，在一切公开场合，人们再也听不到那种黄色歌曲的靡靡之音了。刊印着精美五彩图画的新歌片大量流行，仅沈阳、北京等地就销行了四、五百万份。那些一度滥行的黄色歌片早已受到人们的唾弃，变成了废纸。全国社会主义歌咏运动蓬勃发展，各地涌现出千千万万的群众歌咏组织，它们在工厂、农村、机关、学校建立了强大的红色音乐阵地。
    去年，在资产阶级右派向党向社会主义进攻的风浪里，歌颂资产阶级丑恶灵魂的反动黄色音乐，趁着它的主子们的狂妄攻势，在全国二十多个省市泛滥起来。“毛毛雨”、“夜上海”、“何日君再来”等近百首曾流行在旧社会的黄色歌曲一度卷土重来，受到那些迷恋于资产阶级生活方式者的欣赏、传播，把一些受资产阶级思想影响的人拉向后退，也无情地袭击着纯洁的工人阶级队伍和青年学生。
    随着反右派斗争的胜利，去年在二十多个省市先后展开了反对黄色音乐的各种活动。天津市的音乐演奏团体、影剧院、文化馆等五十八个单位订立了铲除黄色音乐、倡导社会主义新歌咏的公约，互相监督，使黄色歌曲无容身之地。全国各地普遍举办了反对黄色音乐讲座、报告会。北京中央乐团还组织了扫荡黄色音乐的“突击队”，深入工厂、学校、机关等三十多个基层单位，举行生动活泼的对比性的批判黄色音乐的报告会，使大家从对比中鲜明地感到黄色音乐的庸俗、丑恶，对红色音乐产生了强烈的喜爱。沈阳举办“伴舞乐手训练班”，对伴舞乐曲的选材和演奏进行了指导，另外，还举办“通俗音乐会”，积极传播群众易于接受的内容健康的歌曲。长春市的区文化馆在工厂、商店、街道建立广播点，通过扩音器，大张旗鼓地进行了肃清黄色音乐的宣传。沈阳、长沙等地印行大量新歌片，来抵制黄色歌片的流行。
    四川、湖南、河北、内蒙古等地的工会、青年团都积极配合肃清黄色音乐的斗争，向群众广泛地进行了思想教育。各地报纸、杂志刊登的大批文章和群众来信，对黄色音乐进行了严厉批判，表现出群众政治觉悟提高后对黄色音乐的厌恶和愤慨。
    为了彻底清除黄色音乐在群众中的影响，今后批判黄色音乐的工作将结合社会主义歌咏运动的开展继续深入地进行下去。报告会、演奏会将在更多的基层单位举行，红色歌片将经常地大量地印行。最近中国音乐家协会成立了黄色音乐批判小组，准备出版“黄色音乐批判集”，一方面组织专文彻底批判音乐界的资产阶级修正主义思想，另一方面将撰写短文，解决一些群众对肃清黄色音乐的疑问和糊涂思想，从音乐艺术方面提高他们的社会主义觉悟。
