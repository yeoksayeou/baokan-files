    A Milestone in the Great Unity of All Nationalities in Wenshan
    The Establishment of the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan
    (Our newspaper, Wenshan, April 1st) The first session of the first People's Congress of the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which lasted seven days, successfully concluded on April 1st. The Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture was formally announced. The 338 delegates attending the meeting represented the 1.4 million people of the Zhuang, Miao, Han, Yi, Yao, Hui, Bai, and other ethnic groups in Wenshan. Luo Yuntong (Zhuang) was elected as the governor of the prefecture, Ma Shengshen (Han), Huang Shouyun (Miao), Long Mingchuan (Zhuang), Li Xian (Yi), and Zhao Tingguang (Yao) were elected as vice governors, and Wang Chaogui (Zhuang), Li Weigui (Han), Tian Shunxi (Hui), Shi En (Yi, female), Xiong Zhengmei (Miao, female), and 22 others were elected as members of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee. Tian Dexiang (Zhuang) was appointed as the president of the Autonomous Prefecture Intermediate People's Court. Wenshan was designated as the capital of the autonomous prefecture.
    This meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of unprecedented unity. The right-wing arguments that attempted to hinder ethnic unity were thoroughly exposed and refuted. Wenshan is a multi-ethnic area. Due to the persecution of reactionary rulers for thousands of years, one ethnic group was often divided into many branches or different names. For example, some of the Zhuang people came from Long'an and Tianbao in Guangxi, and they were called Long'an people and Tianbao people. Before this meeting, the people of all ethnic groups in Wenshan had conducted detailed discussions on this issue and carried out categorization.
    Some time ago, some malicious individuals, under the pretext of "autonomy," attempted to exclude Han cadres and turn regional autonomy into an "independent kingdom." The delegates at the meeting sternly refuted this, saying, "The great achievements we have made and the large number of ethnic minority cadres that have emerged are all the result of the leadership of the Party and the assistance of the Han people and Han cadres." "Today, the establishment of the autonomous prefecture is a milestone in the great unity of all ethnic groups in Wenshan and a new starting point. In the future, we must resolutely oppose and overcome local nationalism and further consolidate the great unity of all ethnic groups with the Han people as the center."

    文山各民族大团结的里程碑
    云南文山僮族苗族自治州成立
    本报文山1日电　历时七天的文山僮族苗族自治州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议已于1日胜利闭幕，文山僮族苗族自治州正式宣告成立。参加此次会议的三百三十八名代表，代表了文山僮、苗、汉、彝、瑶、回、白等民族的一百四十万人民，选举罗运通（僮）为州长，马生申（汉）、黄寿云（苗）、龙明传（僮）、李铣（彝）、赵廷光（瑶）五人为副州长，王朝贵（僮）、李维贵（汉）、田顺喜（回）、施恩（彝、女）、熊正美（苗、女）等二十七人为自治州人民委员会委员，田德湘（僮）为自治州中级人民法院院长。定文山为自治州首府。
    这次会议是在空前团结的气氛中进行的，那些企图妨害民族团结的右派言论遭到彻底的揭露和驳斥。文山是一个多民族地区，由于千百年来反动统治者的迫害，一个民族往往分为许多支系或不同称谓，例如僮族中有部分人是从广西的隆安、天保迁来的，就叫隆安族、天保族。在这次会议以前，文山各族人民曾就这一问题作了细致的探讨，进行了归系。
    在前些时，曾有存心不良分子借口“自治”，企图排斥汉族干部，把区域自治变成“独立王国”。到会代表对此严加驳斥说：“我们所取得的巨大成绩和涌现出大批民族干部，都是在党的领导下和汉族人民、汉族干部帮助的结果。”“今天成立自治州是文山各民族大团结的里程碑，也是一个新的起点，今后必须坚决反对和克服掉地方民族主义，进一步巩固以汉族为中心的各族人民大团结。”
