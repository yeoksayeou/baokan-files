Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, 6th (TASS): Danish Communist Party Chairman Aksel Larsen wrote in "Land og Folk" that the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing has given new support to the worldwide movement for peace. It is necessary to compel the leaders of those countries that oppose disarmament and high-level talks to begin negotiations.

Larsen pointed out that the main task of the working people at present is to struggle against the threat of war, against atomic weapons, and against militarism.

Larsen also said: The Danish government's position of supporting high-level talks and refusing to deploy atomic weapons in Denmark is supported by the Danish people.
