Grasp Scientific Knowledge, Serve Agricultural Production
Yongfengtun Township Achieves Dual Leap in Production and Culture

(Our Dispatch) Our reporter Liu Peiheng reports: Yongfengtun Township, Changping District, on the outskirts of Beijing, has launched a high tide of cultural leap forward. Currently, it is a scene of joy and songs of building socialism everywhere. They are striving to realize: every team has a club, every group has books to read, there are singers everywhere, everyone has operas to watch, the masses create three thousand works, and everyone learns science and speaks science to create a cultural township. Amidst the cheers of the masses, the township completed all 24,000 mu of spring sowing tasks on the 15th.

Singing has become a popular recreational activity among commune members. At present, the township has seven singing teams composed of youth, women, and the elderly, with more than two hundred people regularly participating in singing activities, singing about their happy lives. Members of the "Moving Mountains and Overturning Seas" and "Leap Forward Pioneer" women's production teams of the Hongfeng Agricultural Cooperative, upon hearing the bell for working in the fields in the early morning, beat gongs and drums, carried fluttering red flags, and sang "Socialism is Good" all the way to the fields. The female commune members of the "Meteor Decisive Battle Team," while working in the fields, carried river mud and sang while "competing" on the high slopes. During breaks, members of the Hero Team composed of elderly women sang "Socialism is Good." In the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative, seventy-five-year-old Liu Old Lady, when planting beans, put down her hoe after digging the ditch, forgot her fatigue, and performed her self-composed ditty "Labor is Glorious" for the young people. Then, she danced to the tune of "Cooperativization is Good" sung by the youth. Zhao Gui, a sixty-eight-year-old choir member of the Old Men's Choir, went to the club to practice singing every evening, and sometimes taught his wife, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter to sing together at home.

In just one week, commune members created 174 works, including scripts, clappers, and doggerel. The clapper "I Go to Cast a Vote" written by Liu Shulin, a statistician of the Third Brigade of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative, and Chen Deyuan, a cadre sent to the countryside, was performed on the day of the election and was very popular with the audience. The Old Men's Choir also composed new songs, one of which goes: "...Don't think I'm old, I can do even better, I want to compete with the young men. Plowing rice paddies, transplanting rice seedlings, we are skilled in everything..."

"Everyone learns science, everyone speaks science" is a resounding slogan put forward by Liu Changfu, the head of Yongfengtun Township. At present, the township has established the Yongfengtun Township Science and Technology Popularization Work Committee. This is the core of leading the township to carry out science popularization work. In a few days, all four agricultural cooperatives in the township established science and technology popularization work groups. Each production team also formed a science and technology popularization team. More than seven hundred people in the township have become science propaganda officers.

The agricultural cooperatives have already taken action in conjunction with the current agricultural season's agricultural science popularization work. Before and after various meetings, and on the fields, they are talking about agricultural technology and reading science tabloids. After listening to Township Technician Wang Jinzhong's lecture on "Nutrient Pot Cotton Seedlings," seventy-five members of the May 1st Agricultural Cooperative went to the fields to carry out actual seedling work the next day. Commune members are very interested in this method of learning science. Some commune members said: In the past, we only knew how to do it, but we didn't know the scientific principles. After listening to the explanation, we understood it in our hearts. The Hongfeng Agricultural Cooperative also organized a farmer's amateur technical night school. Seventy commune members took the first lesson on the 8th of this month. The technician explained the technology of cotton sowing and the use of fertilizers. The township plans to establish such a night school in each agricultural cooperative to train agricultural technicians. This year, the township plans to explain the scientific knowledge related to crop planting, farmland water conservancy management, livestock management, and natural science in combination with the agricultural season, to help commune members master scientific knowledge, summarize production experience, encourage commune members to use their brains and study technology, improve agricultural technology, and promote the agricultural technology revolution.

    掌握科学知识　服务农业生产
    永丰屯乡生产文化双跃进
    本报讯　记者刘佩珩报道：京郊昌平区永丰屯乡，掀起了文化跃进的高潮。目前这里到处是一片建设社会主义的欢乐和歌声。他们正在为实现：队队有俱乐部，组组有书看，到处是歌手，人人有戏看，群众创作三千件和人人学科学、讲科学的文化乡而奋斗。这个乡在万众欢腾中，15日已完成了全部二万四千多亩的春播任务。
    歌咏已经成为社员所喜爱的一项文娱活动。目前这个乡已有青年、妇女、老人分别组成的七个歌咏队，有二百多人经常参加歌咏活动，歌唱自己的幸福生活。宏丰农业社的
  “移山倒海”、“跃进先锋”等妇女生产队的队员们，清晨听到下地劳动的钟声，就打起锣鼓，扛着飘扬的红旗，一路上歌唱着“社会主义好”，奔向田野。“流星决战队”的女社员们，在田间劳动时，她们挑起河泥在高坡上边唱边“比武”。老太太们组成的英雄队，在休息时，队员们就在一起唱一支“社会主义好”。曙光农业社有七十五岁的刘老太太在种豆时，放下挖沟的锄头后，忘掉了疲劳，给年轻人表演她自编的“劳动多光荣”小调。接着她又随着青年们唱起的“合作化就是好”的歌声扭起来。老头合唱队有个六十八岁的合唱队员赵贵，每当傍晚都到俱乐部里去练歌，回家后有时还要教他的老伴和儿媳、孙女大家一起学唱。
    在短短的一周内，社员们创作了剧本、快板、顺口溜等一百七十四件作品。曙光农业社第三大队的统计员刘书林和下放干部陈德元编的快板“我去投一票”，在选举当天就演出了，很受观众欢迎。老头合唱队也自编了新歌曲，其中一段歌词是：“……别看我年老更能干，要和小伙子比比看。刨稻地，插稻苗，样样咱们都是武艺高……”。
      “人人学科学，人人讲科学”是永丰屯乡乡长刘长富提出来的响亮口号。目前这个乡成立了永丰屯乡科学技术普及工作委员会。这是领导全乡开展科学普及工作的核心。在几天的时间里，全乡四个农业社都建立起科学技术普及工作组。各生产队也组成了科学技术普及小组。全乡有七百多人成为讲科学的宣传员。
    各农业社结合当前农业季节的农业科学普及工作已行动起来。在各种会议的会前、会后，在地头上，都在讲农业技术、读科学小报。五一农业社的社员听了乡技术员王进中讲了“营养钵育棉苗”以后，第二天有七十五个社员就到田间进行了实际育苗工作。社员对这种学科学的办法很感兴趣。有的社员说：过去只知道做，不知道科学道理，一听讲解心里就明白了。宏丰农业社还组织了农民业余技术夜校，有七十个社员在本月8日上了第一堂课，技术员讲解了棉花播种的技术和肥料使用的问题。这个乡准备在每个农业社都成立一个这样的夜校，培养农业技术员。这个乡在今年计划结合农事季节分别讲解有关作物的种植、农田水利的管理、牲畜管理和自然科学的科学知识，帮助社员掌握科学知识，总结生产经验，鼓励社员们动脑筋、钻技术，提高农业技术，推动农业技术革命。（附图片）
