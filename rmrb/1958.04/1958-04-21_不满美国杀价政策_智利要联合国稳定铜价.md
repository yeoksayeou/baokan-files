Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, 20th — Chile requested on the 17th that the United Nations International Commodity Trade Committee establish a special agency to find ways to stabilize copper prices.

Chile is an important copper-producing country in the world, exporting more than 400,000 tons of copper annually, accounting for about 60% of its national income. Its copper sales market is mainly the United States. Because the United States has repeatedly lowered copper prices and is preparing to restore copper import taxes in the near future, this has caused enormous difficulties for Chile's national economy.

    不满美国杀价政策
    智利要联合国稳定铜价
    据新华社20日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利17日要求联合国国际商品贸易委员会成立专门机构，设法稳定铜价。
    智利是世界上的重要产铜国家，每年出口铜四十多万吨，占它国民收入的60％左右。它的铜的销售市场主要是美国。由于美国一再压低铜价，并且准备在最近恢复铜的进口税，这就给智利的国民经济造成了巨大困难。
