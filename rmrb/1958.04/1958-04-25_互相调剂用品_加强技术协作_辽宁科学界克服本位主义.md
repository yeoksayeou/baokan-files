Exchanging Supplies, Strengthening Technical Collaboration
Liaoning Scientific Community Overcomes Localism

The various scientific research departments in Liaoning Province, overcoming the ideology of localism, have begun to mutually adjust scientific supplies and strengthen technical collaboration.

The Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Metrology needed fifty-one kinds of instruments this year. After contacting some scientific research units, eighteen kinds have been resolved. Among them are some precision optical instruments and electrical instruments, which used to rely on imports. Now, exchanging what they have for what they need saves foreign exchange and time. The Shenyang Central Laboratory of the Ministry of Geology needed nickel crucibles to analyze the content components of ore. They had been searching for more than a year in various places without finding them. Now, contacting the Shenyang Institute of Forestry and Soil Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences solved the problem. Various scientific research departments and institutions of higher learning have begun to accept scientific instrument repair tasks, to mutually compensate for the lack of technical strength. The photoelectric colorimeter used by the Shenyang Central Laboratory of the Ministry of Geology used to be sent to the Shanghai Instrument Factory for repair, which took three months. Now, the Chemical Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry and Shenyang Medical College can repair this instrument.

This year, the scientific research departments in Liaoning Province are undertaking very heavy scientific research tasks. According to preliminary statistics from the institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in the Liaoning region, the scientific research units of the central ministries, and the seventeen experimental research institutions under local jurisdiction, the scientific research projects proposed this year have greatly increased compared to last year. Most of these projects are related to the survey of national resources, supporting the construction of industrial bases for iron and steel, petroleum, chemical, and coal industries, as well as major scientific problems that urgently need to be solved in agricultural production and people's lives. With the proposal of new and numerous scientific research topics, there must be scientific research equipment adapted to it.

In mid-April, the Liaoning Provincial Science and Technology Commission convened a scientific research supplies coordination meeting. The representatives of twenty-four scientific research units and institutions of higher learning who attended the meeting launched discussions targeting the localism ideology existing in various units. This not only tapped potential, enabling the coordination of some scientific research supplies and saving a large amount of foreign exchange, but also exchanged information on the production and repair of some scientific research supplies, strengthened technical assistance, and resolved the difficulties in repairing some instruments.

    互相调剂用品　加强技术协作
    辽宁科学界克服本位主义
    辽宁省各个科学研究部门，克服本位主义思想，开始科学用品的相互调剂和技术上的相互协作。
    辽宁省计量管理局今年需要的仪器有五十一种，经过和部分科学研究单位联系，已经解决了十八种，其中有些精密的光学仪器和电器仪表，过去需要依靠进口来解决，现在互通有无既节约了外汇又省了时间。地质部沈阳中心试验室需要分析矿石含量成分的镍钳锅，曾到各地找了一年多没有找着，现在和中国科学院沈阳林业土壤研究所联系就解决了。各个科学研究部门和高等院校已开始了接受科学仪器承修任务，来相互弥补技术力量的不足。地质部沈阳中心试验室用的光电比色计过去送到上海仪器厂修理，需要三个月，现在化学工业部化工研究院和沈阳医学院就都能修理这种仪器。
    今年辽宁省的科学研究部门担当科学研究任务很繁重，据辽宁地区的中国科学院各研究所、中央各部科学研究单位和地方所属的十七个试验研究机构的初步统计，今年提出的科学研究项目比去年大大增加。这些项目，大部分是关于祖国资源调查和支援钢铁、石油、化工煤炭等工业基地的建设，以及农业生产和人民生活中迫切需要解决的重大科学问题。随着新的、繁多的科学研究题目的提出，必须有和它相适应的科学研究设备。
    4月中旬，辽宁省科学工作委员会召开了科学研究用品调剂会议，到会的二十四个科学研究单位和高等院校的代表，针对各单位存在的本位主义思想展开讨论，不仅挖掘了潜力，使部分科学研究用品得到调剂，节省了大批外汇，而且交流了一些科学研究用品的生产和修理情况，加强了技术协助，解决了部分仪器修理的困难。
