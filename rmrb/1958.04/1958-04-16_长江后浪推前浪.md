    The rules and regulations are the organized principles extracted from practical affairs. To manage practical affairs well, rules and regulations are indispensable. If practical affairs can maintain their normal state, with few or no changes occurring outside the regulations, then those who rigidly adhere to established rules are capable people. And those who are called capable people often prefer that practical affairs remain constant or change little, because this makes things easier to handle and requires less brainpower. However, the normal state of practical affairs cannot be maintained for long. Even in the feudal era, when social progress was extremely slow, changes would accumulate over time, leading to contradictions between established rules and reality. In such an era, the solution to this contradiction usually began with the changed reality being forced to conform to established rules, but eventually, the masses would rise up and overthrow the established rules along with those who rigidly adhered to them, creating new rules in the struggle, which would then be rigidly adhered to by a new group of capable people.

    Among the ancients, Wang Anshi was probably the most courageous reformer who dared to break established rules. The "Biography of Wang Anshi" in the "History of the Song Dynasty" accuses him of saying, "Heavenly changes are not to be feared, ancestral laws are not to be followed, and public opinion is not to be heeded." This sounds unremarkable to us now, but in Wang Anshi's time, there were very few people who actively advocated reform. Many old or middle-aged gentlemen who feared reform considered it rebellious, and other social activists followed suit. Although Wang Anshi once almost removed all officials from the central to local levels who rigidly adhered to established rules and opposed reform, he ultimately could not avoid failure.

    The changes and development in modern China far surpass anything seen in previous eras. The struggle between those who rigidly adhere to established rules and those who demand reform of various kinds is also exceptionally acute. In this new period of struggle, those who rigidly adhere to established rules, no matter how stubborn, cannot escape the fate of failure. Those who believe that feng shui determines the rise and fall of clans oppose the construction of railways and the opening of mines, but more and more railways are being built, and more and more mines are being opened. The masters of handicraft guilds regard their skills as divinely bestowed and protect them with religious fervor, refusing any improvements, but machine industry quickly pushes their skills aside, leaving no successors and barely a trace. Established rules that could be勉强rigidly adhered to in the past can no longer be rigidly adhered to in modern times.

    After entering the socialist construction period, the face of our country is changing even faster. High mountains are giving way, rivers are changing course, and in the blink of an eye, the sea turns into mulberry fields. All leaders must be good at constantly extracting new principles from developing practical affairs, formulating new rules and regulations, and handling affairs regularly according to the new principles and new regulations, in order to do things well; otherwise, they will fall behind reality more easily than in any previous era.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "People's thinking must adapt to the changed circumstances. Of course, no one can engage in unfounded speculation, nor can they plan their actions beyond the conditions permitted by objective circumstances, and they should not勉强do things that are really impossible. But the problem now is that right-leaning conservative thinking is causing trouble in many aspects, making the work in many areas unable to adapt to the development of objective circumstances. The problem now is that there are many things that could have been done through effort, but many people think they cannot be done. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to constantly criticize the right-leaning conservative thinking that does exist." (Preface to "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside") The surge of socialist enthusiasm among the broad masses of the people that emerged in the rectification campaign powerfully proves the brilliance and correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction, which does not allow people's thinking to remain stagnant in any way. Established rules are constantly being broken, new rules are constantly being generated, and then replaced by newer rules, advancing endlessly, which is the characteristic of our era.

    It can be seen that in our era, the capable people can only be those who dare to declare war on old antiques and dare to break established rules, with the happiness of the people as the highest law. The Yangtze River's back waves push the front waves, and those who rigidly adhere to established rules can no longer be capable people.

    长江后浪推前浪
    李相生
    规章是从实际事务中整理出来的条理。要把实际事务管理好，不可没有规章。如果实际事务能够保持它的常态，不发生或少发生规章以外的变化，那么，墨守成规的人便是办事的能手。而那些被称为办事的能手的人是往往宁愿实际事务保持常态不变或少变的，因为这样，事情便好办些，不会伤脑筋。可是实际事务的常态是不可能保持长久的，即使在社会进步极端缓慢的封建时代，积久也会有变化，以致发生成规和实际的矛盾。在那样的时代，这个矛盾的解决，最初大概总是已经改变了的实际被强迫服从成规，到得后来却是群众起来把成规连同墨守它的人一起推翻，在斗争中产生新的规章，由一班新的办事的能手墨守下去。
    在古人里面最有胆量敢于打破成规的革新家大概要算王安石。宋史王安石传指责他说过“天变不足畏，祖宗不足法，人言不足恤”的话，这在我们现在听来没有什么稀奇，可是在王安石所处的时代，积极主张改革的人是很少很少的，许多害怕改革的老先生们或半老不老的先生们认为大逆不道，其他社会活动分子便也跟着认为大逆不道了。王安石虽然一度几乎把中央到地方一切墨守成规反对改革的官吏全撤职了，最后还是不能免于失败。
    近代中国的变化和发展已远非以前任何时代所能比拟。墨守成规的人同各种各样要求改革的人中间的斗争也异常尖锐。在这个新时期的斗争中，墨守成规的人不论有多么顽强，总是难逃失败的命运。认为风水关系种姓兴衰的人反对修铁路、开矿山，可是铁路越修越多，矿山越开越多。手工业行会的师傅们把他们的技术看作是神授的，用宗教徒的狂热来保护它，拒绝任何改进，可是机器工业很快就把他们的手艺排挤到一旁，后继无人，不绝如缕。从前可以勉强墨守的成规到近代再也无法墨守下去了。
    在进入社会主义建设时期以后，我们国家的面貌变化更快了。高山正在让路，河水正在改途，转瞬之间沧海变为桑田。一切的领导者都必须善于从发展着的实际事务中不断地整理出新的条理，制订出新的规章来，经常按照新的条理、新的规章来办事情，才能把事情办好，否则就要比以前任何时代都更容易落后于实际。
    毛泽东同志说：“人们的思想必须适应已经变化了的情况。当然，任何人不可以无根据地胡思乱想，不可以超越客观情况所许可的条件去计划自己的行动，不要勉强地去做那些实在做不到的事情。但是现在的问题，还是右倾保守思想在许多方面作怪，使许多方面的工作不能适应客观情况的发展。现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到。因此，不断地批判那些确实存在的右倾保守思想，就有完全的必要了”。（“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言）在整风运动中出现的广大人民的社会主义积极性的高涨，有力地证明了毛泽东同志这个指示的英明和正确，它根本不容许人们的思想有任何停滞不前的状态存在。成规不断被突破，新的规章不断产生，而又被更新的规章所代替，永无休止地前进，这就是我们的时代的特征。
    可见在我们的时代，办事的能手只能是那些以人民的幸福为最高法律敢于向老古董宣战、敢于打破成规的人们，长江后浪推前浪，墨守成规的人已经再也不可能是办事的能手了。
