    Labor Training Cannot Forget Putting Politics in Command
    After reading Comrade Yu Zhiming's letter, it reminded me of my own thoughts before going to the countryside. At that time, my thoughts were similar to Comrade Yu Zhiming's. For example, in terms of professional skills, I am a health technician, somewhat "specialized." Going to the countryside, I just need to labor well and obtain the qualification of a farmer to "pass the test." However, as soon as I went to the countryside, I encountered a fundamental question of working for whom. I saw two kinds of labor attitudes in the countryside. One kind is the hardworking faction. No matter how heavy or light the work, no matter how many work points, they do whatever is beneficial to production. This kind of people are mainly poor and lower-middle peasants, accounting for the majority. The other kind is the "young master" faction. They pick light work with high work points, and some even abandon agriculture to engage in business, wanting to make extra money. This kind of people are a very small minority. Who should we learn from? Undoubtedly, we should learn from the hardworking faction. Can we ignore the "young master" faction? Of course not. We should persuade them and pull them back from the capitalist road. I think, in this struggle between two roads, if our sent-down cadres do this, it is a sign of good training. It shows that politics is in command, we have stood firm, and we have become "redder." On the contrary, only focusing on labor and not caring which road we are running on is a sign of poor training.
    Secondly, labor is indeed a very important form of training for us intellectuals. It can pull down our intellectual airs, making us able to carry burdens on our shoulders and baskets in our hands. But it is not our purpose of training after all, but only a means of training. What is our purpose of training? For ourselves, in short, it is to transform our thinking, that is, to promote the proletariat and eliminate capitalism. Since it is to promote the proletariat and eliminate capitalism, then one can imagine: if we only focus on labor and do not care about the class struggle in the countryside, and do not actively participate in various political activities to improve our class consciousness, then how can we say that we have transformed our thinking well? Therefore, I believe that in labor training, we must not forget "putting politics in command."

    劳动锻炼不能忘记政治挂帅
    读了余志明同志的信，使我回想起自己在下乡前的想法。当时，我的想法跟余志明同志的想法有类似之处。比如，论业务，自己是一个卫生技术人员，多少“专”一点，下乡去只要好好劳动，取得个农民的资格就好过“关”了。可是，我一下乡就碰到一个带有根本性质的为谁劳动的问题。我看到在农村里有两种劳动态度的人。一种是苦干派，不论重活轻活、工分多少，只要是对生产有利的活都干，这种人主要是贫农和下中农，占多数。另一种是“少爷”派，干活挑轻的、工分又多的活，有的还丢掉农业去做买卖，想捞外快。这种人是极少数。我们去了跟谁学呢？无疑地应该跟苦干派学。对“少爷”派是不是能置之不理呢？当然不能，应该说服他们，把他们从资本主义的道路上拉回头来。我想，在这样两条道路的斗争中，我们下放干部如果这样做了，就是锻炼得好的一个标志，这说明政治挂了帅，站稳了立场，“红”了一步。反之，只顾埋头劳动，不管往哪条道路跑，就是锻炼得不好的一个标志。
    其次，劳动对我们知识分子来说，固然是一种很重要的锻炼，它可以把我们知识分子的架子拉下来，变得肩能挑担，手能提篮，但它毕竟不是我们锻炼的目的，而只是一种锻炼的手段。我们锻炼的目的是什么呢？对我们本身来说，简言之是改造思想，也就是说兴无灭资。既然是兴无灭资，那么可以设想：如果只顾埋头劳动，不关心农村中的阶级斗争，不积极参加各项政治活动来提高自己的阶级觉悟，那么怎能说是把思想改造好了呢？因此，我认为在劳动锻炼中，也不能忘记“政治挂帅”。
