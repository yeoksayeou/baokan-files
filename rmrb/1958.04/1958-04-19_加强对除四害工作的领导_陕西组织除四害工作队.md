These teams are divided into nine working groups, and they will work in the Yulin, Yan'an, Ankang, Shangluo, and Hanzhong Special Zones, as well as some counties and cities in Guanzhong. Their main tasks are to strengthen the leadership of the Eliminate the Four Pests campaign in various places, summarize advanced experiences of the masses, cooperate in providing technical guidance, and carry out the identification of "Four-No" areas (areas with no rats, flies, mosquitoes, and bedbugs). Before the work teams departed, the responsible comrades of the Shaanxi Provincial Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and the Shaanxi Provincial Health Department gave them important instructions. They also studied relevant documents on Eliminate the Four Pests and hygiene.
