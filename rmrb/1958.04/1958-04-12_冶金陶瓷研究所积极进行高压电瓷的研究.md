The research work on high-voltage electrical porcelain in coordination with the new high-voltage electrical porcelain factory is one of the Sino-Soviet technical cooperation projects accepted by the Research Institute of Metallurgical Ceramics in 1954. Over the past four years, this research work has achieved certain results, but the progress has been relatively slow. Encouraged by the atmosphere of the Great Leap Forward, the researchers of the electrical porcelain group have shown unprecedented enthusiasm. In less than three months, they have determined the preliminary formula for porcelain bodies and glazes. Now, they are conducting further experiments to determine process conditions and preparing for intermediate factory trials and process tests to prepare conditions for trial production in the new factory next year.

In early March, the Research Institute of Metallurgical Ceramics signed a new contract with industrial departments and accepted the urgent task of conducting small-scale intermediate expansion production tests for several important new industrial products. According to the usual progress in the past, each intermediate expansion production test project would take at least three months. Now, every researcher involved is doing everything possible to improve work efficiency, automatically reducing rest time, and resolutely ensuring that all six test projects are completed within two months, delivering accurate and complete test data to the production departments.

    冶金陶瓷研究所积极进行高压电瓷的研究
    配合新建的高压电瓷厂的研究工作，是冶金陶瓷研究所1954年接受的中苏技术合作的项目之一。四年来，这项研究工作已经取得了一定的成绩，但是工作进展比较迟缓。在大跃进形势鼓舞下，电瓷组的研究人员积极性空前高涨，在不到三个月的时间内就确定了瓷坯、瓷釉的初步配方，现在已在做进一步确定工艺条件的试验，并准备进行中间工厂试验和工艺试验，为明年在新厂进行试生产准备条件。
    3月初，冶金陶瓷研究所又和工业部门签订了一项新的合同，接受了为几种重要的工业新产品进行小型中间扩大生产试验的紧急任务。按照过去的一般进度，每个中间扩大生产试验项目至少要三个月时间。现在，每个有关研究人员都想尽办法提高工作效率，自动减少休息时间，坚决保证两个月内全部完成六个试验项目，把正确、完整的试验数据送到生产部门。
