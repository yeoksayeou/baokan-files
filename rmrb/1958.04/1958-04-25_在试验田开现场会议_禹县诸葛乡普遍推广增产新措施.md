Holding On-site Meetings in Experimental Fields
Yu County’s Zhuge Township Universally Promotes New Measures for Increased Production

(Reported by this newspaper) The CCP Zhuge Township Committee in Yu County, during different production seasons, uses the method of "secretary leading secretaries" to hold on-site meetings in experimental fields. Through the method of doing while researching, many new measures for increased production have been perfectly realized in the production process.

Zhuge Township's leadership method began to be used in February of this year. At that time, the township was calling on the masses to universally irrigate wheat with "returning green water." In the past, farmers here did not have the habit of spring irrigation of wheat, and most farmers were afraid that irrigation would freeze the wheat seedlings. Township and commune cadres were also unsure. The CCP Township Committee believed that if this problem was not solved, it would inevitably affect the realization of the township's measures for increased production. According to the decision of the Township Party Committee, the Party Committee Secretary first led the branch secretaries of each commune to conduct spring irrigation experiments in the wheat experimental fields, and based on the growth and changes of the wheat seedlings after irrigation, compared them with the unirrigated wheat fields, and summarized the benefits of spring irrigation of wheat. Each commune and production team also followed this method, with the commune branch secretary (or commune director) leading the production team leader, and the production team leader leading the farming group leader, to hold similar on-site meetings. In this way, not only did the township and commune cadres understand the role and significance of spring irrigation of wheat, but also the broad masses personally saw the benefits of spring irrigation of wheat. As a result, the work of irrigating wheat with "returning green water" was rapidly carried out throughout the township.

Throughout the entire spring plowing and sowing process, they successively held six on-site meetings of different natures, including spring irrigation of wheat and spring plowing and land preparation, cotton sowing, strengthening the later management of wheat, cultivating rice seedlings, and planting sweet potatoes. This enabled commune and team cadres to truly understand and master the specifications, quality, specific requirements, and operational techniques of this type of farm work, changing the old farming habits of the local farmers and improving farming techniques.

    在试验田开现场会议
    禹县诸葛乡普遍推广增产新措施
    本报讯　中共禹县诸葛乡委员会在不同的生产季节里，运用书记带书记在试验田里召开现场会议，通过边干、边研究的方法，使许多新的增产措施在生产过程中完满地实现了。
    诸葛乡的这种领导方法是从今年2月间开始运用的。当时，乡里正号召群众普遍浇小麦返青水。过去这里的农民没有小麦春浇的习惯，多数农民都害怕浇水会把麦苗冻坏。乡、社干部自己心里也没有底。中共乡党委会认为：这个问题如不解决，势必会影响全乡增产措施的实现。按照乡党委的决定，党委书记便首先带领各社的支部书记在小麦试验田里进行了春浇试验，并且根据浇过以后的麦苗生长和变化情况，与不浇的麦田作了对比，总结了小麦春浇的好处。各社和生产队也都仿照这一办法，由社支部书记（或社主任）带领生产队长，生产队长带领耕作组长，分别召开了类似的现场会议。这样，不但使乡、社干部都了解小麦春浇的作用与意义，并且使广大群众都亲自看到小麦春浇的好处，于是，全乡的浇灌小麦返青水的工作便迅速开展了。
    在整个春耕播种的过程中，他们先后召开了小麦春浇和春耕整地、棉花播种、加强小麦后期管理、培育稻秧、栽红薯等六次不同性质的现场会议，使社、队干部真正了解和掌握这种农活的规格、质量、具体要求和操作技术，改变了当地农民的旧有耕作习惯，提高了耕作技术。
