Chairman Mao and the Sailors
By our reporter, Yin Ping

March 28th, a calm spring night, a refreshing and gentle evening breeze rippled across the river surface, and the river water rippled slightly. Everywhere was a scene of peace and tranquility. The mountain city of Chongqing had already fallen asleep. Only the crew members of the Jiangxia Wheel, docked near Chaotianmen, were still working hard - they were about to embark on an extraordinary voyage tomorrow.

After 1:00 a.m., a car stopped at the pier. A tall, sturdy man in a light grey coat stepped out and walked steadily towards the Jiangxia Wheel. Yin Zhenglu, the passenger transport team leader on the ship, was preparing to come out to greet the guests. Suddenly, he froze. Ah! Chairman Mao! It was Chairman Mao, whom we had been thinking about and deeply loved, had arrived. Chairman Mao, what a kind face, what a healthy body! Yin Zhenglu was so excited that he was at a loss. How should he greet Chairman Mao? Before he could think more, Chairman Mao had already walked up to him, extended his hand, and greeted him. Yin Zhenglu hurriedly extended both hands and shook them tightly. The news of Chairman Mao's arrival quickly spread among all the sailors on the ship.

In the early morning, the Jiangxia Wheel set sail. This was a voyage that the sailors on the Jiangxia Wheel would never forget. Chairman Mao came to the stern of the third floor to admire the beautiful scenery along the way. Comrade Wang Renzhong (First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China) arrived here with chief pilot Yang Dafu and young third mate Shi Ruoyi. Chairman Mao turned around, discovered them, greeted them warmly, shook hands with them, and asked them to sit on the sofa next to him. Chairman Mao asked them a series of questions: what were their names, where were they from, how old were they, what kind of work did they do on the ship...? At first, they felt restrained, but Chairman Mao's kind and friendly words quickly made them feel less restrained. They felt as natural and comfortable as if they were by their own relatives' sides.

Chairman Mao sat down, lit a cigarette, and smoked it slowly. Comrades Ke Qingshi (First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China), Li Jingquan (First Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China), and Ren Baige (First Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China) were also sitting with him.

"Have you read the story of a Soviet female captain published in the pictorial? Have you encountered so many difficulties?" Chairman Mao asked kindly.

"I have read it, but my situation is not exactly the same as hers. Of course, there are difficulties," Shi Ruoyi replied with a smile.

"Is it difficult to learn to drive?"

"When I first boarded the ship, I didn't understand anything and was really scared."

"What about now?"

"Now I understand a little, so I'm not so scared."

"Yes," Chairman Mao agreed, "When you don't understand something, you are often afraid. Just like snakes, when people don't understand them and haven't grasped their characteristics, they feel very scared. But once they understand them and grasp their characteristics and weaknesses, they are no longer afraid and can catch them." Then, Chairman Mao asked, "How long have you been working on the ship?" When Shi Ruoyi said that it had been more than four years, Chairman Mao turned and asked Yang Dafu, "What about you?" Yang Dafu replied, "More than thirty years." Chairman Mao said to Shi Ruoyi with a kind face: "You must learn from them. These old workers are your good teachers. They have a wealth of experience on the water, and much knowledge cannot be learned from books." The young Shi Ruoyi only felt warmth in her heart. How concerned Chairman Mao was about the growth of young people!

After sailing for a day and a night in the turbulent river, the Jiangxia Wheel arrived in Fengjie County and began to enter the Three Gorges. The banks were full of steep cliffs and towering peaks. At one moment, the mountains blocked the way forward, and at another, the road turned back to the peaks, with only a waterway connecting them. Here were the famous Wushan Twelve Peaks, as well as the famous dangerous rapids: Xintan, Xietan, and Kongling, which sailors called the Gate of Hell. The water in the river was turbulent, and uneven waves were stirred up on the surface of the water, with whirlpools one after another, and the sound of the water was noisy and continuous. Here was a magnificent view of the motherland's mountains and rivers, and it was also the section of the Yangtze River with the most hidden reefs and the most dangerous navigation. However, thanks to the channel improvement and the skilled techniques of the sailors in the years since liberation, the Jiangxia Wheel was speeding safely.

At around 10:00 a.m., Chairman Mao came to the bridge and greeted the staff on the bridge warmly. Captains Li Jicheng, Mo Jiarui, and helmsman He Lifu immediately became Chairman Mao's friends. A cordial conversation began immediately. Chairman Mao asked the crew members with concern which places were the most difficult to navigate, which channels needed to be improved, whether they could navigate at night, whether any ships had crashed on rocks... and so on. The crew members gave a detailed account of the channel improvement work in recent years. Thanks to this management, not only could some previously impassable dangerous areas be navigated smoothly, but also because navigation marks had been set up, most ships could now travel unimpeded at night. This made Chairman Mao very happy. "Some places still have very bad channels. Is everyone in favor of building a large dam in the Three Gorges that can generate electricity, facilitate navigation, and prevent floods and irrigate land?" Chairman Mao suddenly asked. "I am very much in favor of it. With the construction of the dam, navigation will be even more convenient," Li Jicheng replied readily.

Looking out from the bridge, there was a small mountain on the north bank below Fengjie. The ancient city walls and temples had collapsed, but their traces were still visible. The young girl Shi Ruoyi excitedly stepped forward and told Chairman Mao: This is Baidi City. Our great leader and poet, looking at this historical city, recited a poem by the ancient poet Li Bai: "Departing from Baidi among the colourful clouds at dawn, I return to Jiangling in a thousand li in a single day. The monkeys on both banks keep on screaming, but the light boat has passed ten thousand mountains."

On the bridge, Chairman Mao continued to talk with the captain and helmsmen. Chairman Mao carefully asked the crew about their living conditions: how much was their salary, how was their life compared to the past, did they have vacations, could they often go home...? These concerned conversations almost moved the old captain Li Jicheng, who had been a sailor and worked on the water for half his life, to tears. He thought: In the past, which national leader would have cared so much about the lives of sailors? Chairman Mao saw the young helmsman He Lifu skillfully steering the boat and was very happy, so he walked over and asked him: "How old are you?" He Lifu replied: "Eighteen years old." Chairman Mao said: "You are still young, you must study hard." Turning around, he said to the captain: "Your experience is rich, you must train more apprentices and pass on your skills to young people." Li Jicheng thought, what valuable instructions these were! He immediately replied firmly: "I guarantee to train more apprentices."

Chairman Mao repeatedly studied the driving work with the drivers, meticulously studied the technical problems such as how to use the car bell, how to indicate directions, and how to steer the boat, and also inquired about how many people there were in the driving department and the engine department, and what specific work they were responsible for. Chairman Mao was interested in everything and wanted to understand everything. He said excitedly: "If I study driving, I must learn to sail through this section of the Three Gorges."

After three days and nights of sailing, the Jiangxia Wheel successfully completed this glorious voyage and arrived safely in Wuhan. Chairman Mao was about to leave everyone. The crew members stood on both sides of the corridor, seeing off their most beloved leader with extremely excited hearts. Chairman Mao said to them kindly: "Thank you!" After shaking hands with everyone one by one to say goodbye, he left the Jiangxia Wheel.

Watching Chairman Mao's tall figure leave, people still stood there reluctantly, watching him go, a sense of happiness lingering in their hearts.

After seeing off Chairman Mao, it was already after 2:00 a.m. Chief engineer Wang Bingchun could no longer sleep. He returned to his room and began to consider revising his plan to ensure that the Jiangxia Wheel would not stop sailing throughout the year and to ensure safety. The next day, the young helmsman He Lifu went to see the secretary of the Youth League branch, Yao Zhimin, and took the initiative to examine his past faults of not studying hard, and was determined to strive to become a member of the Communist Youth League. Recently, it was his turn to take a vacation, and he had decided to participate in 50 days of voluntary labor in the countryside to reform himself properly. Shi Ruoyi, a young member of the Communist Youth League, also made up her mind to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, learn humbly, and strive to become a red and expert female sailor.

    毛主席和海员
    本报记者　殷平
    3月28日，一个沉静的春夜，清爽而温柔的晚风阵阵拂过江面，江水微波荡漾，到处是一片和平的宁静，重庆这个山城已经入睡了。只有停泊在朝天门附近的江峡轮上的船员们还在紧张的工作着——他们明天要进行一次不平凡的航行。
    深夜一点多钟，一辆小汽车停在这个码头上，一位高大魁伟、穿着浅灰色大衣的人走出来，稳步地向江峡轮走去。船上的客运组长殷正禄正准备出来迎接客人。突然，他怔住了。啊！毛主席！是我们日夜想念的、敬爱的毛主席来了。毛主席，多么慈祥的面容、多么健康的身体啊！殷正禄兴奋得手足无措了，应该怎么来迎接毛主席呢？没等他想的更多，毛主席已走到他的面前，伸出手来和他握手问好了。殷正禄慌忙地伸出一双手来紧紧地握着。毛主席到来的消息迅速地在全船海员们中间传开了。
    清晨，江峡轮启程了。这是江峡轮上海员们永远难忘的一次航行。毛主席来到三楼船尾上，眺望那沿途的美好风光。王任重同志（中共湖北省委第一书记）带着大引水杨大福和年青的女三副石若仪来到这里。毛主席转过身来发现了他们，亲切地招呼他们过去，跟他们握手问好，要他们坐在自己身旁的沙发上。毛主席向他们提出了一连串的问题：叫什么名字，哪里人，多大年纪，在船上作什么工作……。开始，他们感到拘束，但是，主席和蔼可亲的言谈，很快就使他们不再感到拘束了，就仿佛在自己亲人身边一样的自然、自在。
    毛主席坐下来了，他点燃一支香烟慢慢地吸着。和他坐在一起的还有柯庆施同志（中共上海市委第一书记）、李井泉同志（中共四川省委第一书记）、任白戈同志（中共重庆市委第一书记）等。
    “你看过画报上刊登的一位苏联女船长的故事吗？有没有遇到过那么多的困难呢？”主席和蔼地问。
    “看过，我的情况不完全和她一样。当然，困难是有的。”石若仪微笑着回答说。
    “学习驾驶困难吗？”
    “开始上船时，一点也不懂，真感到害怕。”
    “现在呢？”
    “现在懂得了一些，也就没有那样害怕了。”
    “是的”毛主席同意地说，“当你对一件事物还不了解时，往往是害怕的。正如蛇一样，当人们还不了解它、没有掌握它的特性时，感到十分害怕，但是，一旦了解了它，掌握了它的特性和弱点，就不再害怕了，而且可以捉住它。”接着，毛主席又问：“你在船上工作了多久？”当石若仪说到有四年多了的时候，毛主席又转过去问杨大福：“你呢？”杨大福回答说：“三十多年了。”毛主席慈祥地对石若仪说：“要好好向他们学习，他们这些老工人是你的好师傅，水上经验都很丰富，许多知识是书本上学不到的。”年青的石若仪只感到心里热呼呼的，主席是多么关怀青年人的成长啊！
    江峡轮在波涛滚滚的江里航行了一天一夜以后，来到奉节县境，开始进入三峡。两岸尽是悬崖绝壁，奇峰林立，一时大山当前阻住去路，一时又路回峰转，一水相通。这里有著名的巫山十二峰，也有著名的险滩：新滩、泄滩和被海员们称为鬼门关的崆岭。江中水流湍急，水面上激起了起伏不平的波涛，漩涡一个接着一个，水声喧哗不息。这里展现着祖国山河的奇伟景色，也是长江中暗礁最多、航行最险的一段。但是，由于解放以后几年来的航道修整和水手的熟练技术，江峡轮安然地疾驶着。
    上午十时左右，毛主席来到了驾驶台，热情地和驾驶台上的工作人员招呼。船长李吉成、莫家瑞、舵工贺理富等马上又成了毛主席的朋友。亲切的谈话马上就开始了。毛主席关心地问船员们，那些地方最难航行，那些航道需要修整，能不能夜航，有没有船撞在石头上面……等等。船员们详细地讲述了近几年来航道整治工作情况，由于这种治理，不仅一些过去不能通航的险滩地带能顺利通行，而且由于设立了航标，轮船大都能通夜航行无阻了。这使毛主席十分高兴。“有些地方航道仍然很不好，在三峡修一个大水闸，又发电又便利航运，还可以防洪、灌溉，你们赞成吗？”毛主席突然问。“我太赞成了，修了水闸，航行就更加方便了。”李吉成爽快地回答说。
    从驾驶台上向外望去，在奉节以下北岸有一座小山，古旧的城垣和庙宇已倒塌了，但形迹依然可见。年轻的姑娘石若仪兴奋地走上前去告诉毛主席：这就是白帝城。我们的伟大领袖和诗人，看着看着这历史名城，随口背诵了古代诗人李白的一首诗：“朝辞白帝彩云间，千里江陵一日还，两岸猿声啼不住，轻舟已过万重山。”
    在驾驶台上，毛主席继续和船长、舵工们交谈着。毛主席仔细地问着船员们的生活情况：工资多少，比过去过得怎样，有没有休假，能不能经常回家……，这些关切的谈话，使这位从水手出身、在水上工作了半辈子的老船长李吉成几乎感动得掉下泪来。他想：在过去，有哪一位国家领袖会这样关怀船员的生活呢？毛主席看到年轻的舵工贺理富在熟练地掌舵，心里很欢喜，就走过去问他：“多大年纪了？”贺理富回答说：“十八岁。”毛主席说：“还年青啦，要好好学习。”转过来他又对船长说：“你的经验是丰富的，要多带徒弟，把技术传授给青年人。”李吉成心想这是多么宝贵的指示啊！他立即坚决地回答：“我保证多带徒弟。”
    毛主席反复地和驾驶员们研究了驾驶工作，细致地研究了如何使用车钟、如何指示方向、如何掌舵等技术问题，并且还询问了驾驶部和轮机部有多少人，具体担负什么工作。毛主席对什么都很感兴趣，什么都想了解，他兴奋地说道：“假如我学习驾驶，一定要学会驶过三峡这一段航程。”
    经过三个昼夜的航行，江峡轮胜利完成了这次光荣的航行任务，安稳地抵达了武汉。毛主席就要和大家分别了。船员们站在两旁走廊里怀着异常激动的心情欢送自己最亲爱的领袖。毛主席亲切地对他们说：“谢谢你们！”一一地和大家握手告别后，才离开了江峡轮。
    眼看着毛主席高大的身影离开了，人们仍然依依不舍地站在那里目送着他，一种幸福感萦绕在心头。
    送走毛主席以后，已经是深夜两点多钟了，轮机长王炳春再也睡不着，他回到房间开始考虑修订自己的计划，要作到使江峡轮全年不停航和保证安全。青年舵工贺理富第二天就去找团支部书记姚治民谈，主动地检查了过去不虚心学习的毛病，决心争取作一个共青团员。最近轮到他休假，他已经决定在农村参加五十天义务劳动，好好地改造自己。女共青团员石若仪也下定决心要按照毛主席指示，虚心学习，争取作一个又红又专的女海员。
