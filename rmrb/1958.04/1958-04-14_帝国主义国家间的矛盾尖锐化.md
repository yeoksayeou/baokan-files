Intensified Contradictions Among Imperialist Countries
Soviet Union: Ke Qiaotekefu

The Myth and Reality of Capitalist Solidarity

Bourgeois ideologists and politicians of capitalist countries have recently been tirelessly talking about the so-called solidarity of the Western world. They have been trumpeting through newspapers, radio, and television broadcasts that the contradictions in the capitalist world have long been eliminated, and now the unity of political, economic, and military goals unites capitalist countries together. For example, the declaration of the meeting of the heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization participating countries stated: "Within the North Atlantic Treaty, there is absolutely no place for the concept of controlling the world."

This statement is far from reality and the truth of the capitalist world. Naturally, imperialist countries have some common interests, which are determined by the struggle of monopoly capital to maintain and consolidate the entire world capitalist system. However, this has not eliminated the brutal and increasingly fierce political and economic struggle between imperialist countries.

The big bourgeoisie of the United States, Britain, West Germany, France, and other countries have formed a "united front" to maintain the exploitation and oppression of the working people and the enslavement of the colonies; they want to collude to suppress the revolutionary movement of the working class and the national liberation struggle of the people in colonies and dependent countries. However, when it comes to coveting the ambition to dominate the world capitalist market, and competing for the priority of exploiting the people of the capitalist world, there are fundamental differences in the interests of the bourgeoisie of various countries.

The constant pursuit of super-profits by monopoly capital is the economic basis of the external contradictions of imperialism. The pursuit of super-profits by monopoly capital prompts imperialist countries to fight madly for monopoly sales markets, raw material producing areas, and investment locations.

Competition for Markets and Investment Scope

The intensification of contradictions between several major imperialist countries is the most prominent feature of the current development of capitalism. Since the emergence of imperialism, monopoly alliances have never needed foreign markets and investment locations as urgently as in recent times. This is because: first, many European and Asian countries that originally accounted for a large proportion of world production and trade have broken away from the capitalist world market and embarked on the road of socialism; second, the development of domestic industries, especially heavy industry, in the less developed countries that have gained independence has reduced the sales market for monopoly capital; third, the expansion of armaments in capitalist countries has sharpened the contradiction between productivity and the purchasing power of the working people, thereby posing the problem of finding new markets for monopoly capital.

As a result of World War II and post-war developments, the balance of power among the major capitalist countries in the world capitalist system has changed. The proportion of the United States in world capitalist industrial production increased from 41.4% in 1937 to 56.4% in 1948. Now the United States accounts for more than half of the world's capitalist industrial production.

The important industrial and military strategic raw materials controlled by U.S. monopoly capital account for about half of the reserves and about two-thirds of the mining volume. The role of American imperialism as the main financial exploiter of the capitalist world has also been greatly strengthened. This is specifically manifested in the fact that the United States accounted for more than two-thirds of the capital exports in the capitalist world throughout the post-war period. About two-thirds of the gold reserves in the capitalist world are concentrated in the hands of the American bourgeoisie. However, in recent years, the economic expansion of American capital has encountered increasing resistance from other capitalist countries, including West Germany and Japan.

Competition in the world capitalist market for industrial finished products, especially means of production, is very fierce. This market plays a leading role in the world capitalist trade system. Gaining a dominant position in this market can first guarantee the priority of obtaining monopolistic high profits through unequal exchange, and second, control the economies of colonies and less developed countries.

In the early years after the war, the main competitors for the advantage in the capitalist world market for industrial manufactured goods were the United States and Britain. However, starting around 1950, West Germany also joined this struggle, and West Germany quickly ranked third after these two countries in terms of exporting manufactured goods.

The balance of power in the world capitalist market for industrial finished products continues to change. The United States is still in first place, accounting for 25% of the total world exports of industrial manufactured goods. However, the economic expansion of West Germany, the U.S. competitor, has strengthened, and as a result, the proportion of the Federal Republic of Germany has increased from 7.3% in 1950 to 16% in 1956. West German imperialists rank second after the United States in the world exports of machinery, chemicals, and small passenger cars.

The activities of Japanese monopoly capital have also intensified. Before the war, Japanese industrialists mainly competed with British, American, and German monopoly capital in the export of textiles. But now Japan is a major exporter not only of textiles, but also of machinery, iron and steel products, merchant ships, etc. Japanese monopoly capital is particularly active in the markets of the Sterling Area countries. In 1956, Japan surpassed Britain to rank first in the world in the production of merchant ships.

In recent years, the positions of France and Italy in the capitalist world's exports of industrial products, especially machinery exports, have been declining.

It can be seen that in the current stage of development of the capitalist world, the general trend of the struggle between the monopoly capital of major capitalist countries is: the position of West German and Japanese monopoly capital is constantly strengthening, while the capital of the United States, especially Britain and France, is being squeezed out.

Now, American, West German, and French monopoly capital hope to expand their foreign markets by establishing a European Common Market. However, the establishment of the West European Common Market will not weaken the intensification of the struggle between imperialist countries. On the contrary, it can only make this struggle more intense, because the benefits of establishing the Common Market will fall into the hands of West German and American monopoly capital, while the interests of British industrial giants will be harmed.

Competition in capital exports has greatly intensified in the post-war period. It is well known that investments in foreign countries, especially in less developed countries, bring huge super-profits to all masters. In recent years, the net interest rate of the American "California Mobil Oil Company" and "Texaco Petroleum Company" in Saudi Arabia's oil exploitation is about 39% to 47%. The profit rate of the British-Dutch oil monopoly "Royal Dutch Shell" in 1956 was 190%, and the net interest rate of "British Petroleum" was 47%. The British company "Brooke Bond," which produces tea in Ceylon, India, and Africa, had a net interest rate of 51% in 1956, and the net profit of Anglo-American monopoly capital operating in South Africa in 1956 was 60%. It is for this high profit that the monopoly capital of imperialist countries is engaged in a life-and-death struggle for dominance in the world capital market.

The balance of power of imperialist countries in world capital exports has undergone a fundamental change in favor of the United States after the war. U.S. investments abroad increased from $12.5 billion in 1939 to $49.5 billion in 1956. This amount exceeds the total foreign investments of Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, and Italy by several times.

The people of the capitalist world, especially the people of less developed countries, have to pay large amounts of tribute to American monopoly capital. According to official U.S. statistics, the profit of U.S. foreign investment from 1946 to 1956 was $26.4 billion.

The main competitor of the United States in capital exports is Britain. During the post-war period, British capital exports averaged approximately 210 million pounds, or 588 million U.S. dollars, per year. The main area of British investment is in the Commonwealth countries. British capital has a stronger position in the Sterling Area than American monopoly capital.

In recent years, West Germany has become a dangerous competitor to the United States and Britain. West Germany's capital exports have long been ranked third after these two countries. The intensification of competition in capital exports naturally makes the external political contradictions of imperialism tend to intensify. The political contradictions and economic contradictions of the imperialist camp are increasingly aggravated.

U.S. Imperialism's Ambition to Dominate the World

U.S. imperialism is trying to dominate the world. It attempts to establish a system in which political and economic leadership is given to the hands of the American big bourgeoisie, and other capitalist countries become vassals of the United States.

U.S. imperialism controls the politics and economy of many countries in Latin America, as well as countries such as Israel, the Philippines, South Vietnam, and South Korea. The influence of American imperialism in Western Europe has been greatly strengthened after the war. It can be said directly that in the post-war capitalist world, there is not a single corner that does not feel the heavy pressure of American capital, and not a single corner that does not feel the oppression and coercion of American monopoly capital.

American imperialists are the organizers of aggressive groups such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. For many countries in the capitalist world, American military bases (some of which have been equipped with weapons of mass destruction) are the source of serious danger. Placing such weapons on the territory of many countries in the capitalist world not only threatens the sovereignty of these countries, but also threatens the existence of these countries themselves.

The collapse of the imperialist colonial system has greatly weakened the British Empire. However, it would be naive to think that British imperialism is no longer capable of resisting the American offensive. The British big bourgeoisie is using all methods to consolidate its position in the countries within the British Empire, intensifying the export of capital and goods to Latin America and the Middle East, and competing with its opponents, primarily the United States and West Germany, for new sales markets and raw material producing areas. A well-known Conservative activist, Emery, once spoke on behalf of the interests of the British big bourgeoisie: "In the generation of many of us, the United States has leaped to a position of dominating the world. Why can't the British Commonwealth, which has a large amount of human and material resources, catch up with or even surpass the United States in the generation of the next generation?"

While participating in aggressive groups and supporting American foreign policy, British imperialists also have to conduct fierce struggles with this country in foreign markets. They attempt to use a new strategy in this struggle, the essence of which is: to attempt to use American support to maintain and consolidate the British colonial empire and strengthen its influence in the capitalist world.

France has profound contradictions with the United States and West Germany. France is increasingly falling into a position of relying on the United States economically and politically. The United States uses so-called "aid" and loans to squeeze France out of its colonies and dependencies. The United States has controlled South Vietnam and infiltrated Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. Naturally, all of this cannot but touch on the profound economic interests of the French monopoly bourgeoisie. French monopoly capital is fighting with American and German imperialists to maintain French colonies, to maintain European sales markets, and to expand France's sphere of influence in capitalist countries.

West Germany relies on the United States both economically and politically. In many cases, American and West German monopoly capital adopt joint economic expansion in some less developed countries and Western European countries. However, their interests clash in the struggle to gain monopolistic super-profits.

The United States' support of German imperialism has revived one of Britain's most important rivals, and also revived a competitor for itself. 1956 to 1957 was a time of competition between Britain, Germany, France, Germany, and Germany and the United States for high profits in the world capitalist market. German imperialism is once again competing with Britain and the United States in the European market and the Latin American market. German monopoly capital has begun to rapidly invade the countries within the British Empire.

West Germany is seeking to regain Germany's former colonies in Africa. According to the Swedish "Picture" magazine, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht proposed the return of the colonies of Togo, French Cameroon, and Belgian Ruanda-Urundi to West Germany in a secret letter to a group of industrial giants in Essen. Schacht emphasized the value of these colonies, especially the value of Ruanda-Urundi, which contains rich uranium mines, and he hoped that the United States would support West Germany's demands.

Japan is increasingly becoming a powerful rival to major imperialist countries. During the period from 1951 to 1957, Japan began to vigorously squeeze Britain out of its traditional markets again. Japanese monopoly capital is competing not only with the British bourgeoisie, but also with American and West German capital.

This is the real situation of the interrelationship between capitalist countries. The entire post-war development of capitalism vividly confirms the conclusion put forward in the declaration of the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, that is, capitalist society is torn apart by serious contradictions between imperialist countries. The inseparable characteristic of the world socialist system is the unity of interests of its member countries and their strong unity, while the characteristics of the capitalist camp are the increasing internal and external contradictions, fierce competition with each other, and an increasingly fierce struggle to seize sales markets and investment scope. This shows the parasitism and decay of world capitalism.

    帝国主义国家间的矛盾尖锐化
    苏联　科契特科夫
    资本主义团结的神话和实际情况
    资产阶级的思想家和资本主义国家的政治家近来喋喋不休地谈论所谓西方世界的团结一致。他们通过报刊、电台和电视广播大吹大擂地说，资本主义世界的矛盾早已消除了，现在政治、经济和军事目标的一致把资本主义国家团结在一起。譬如，北大西洋公约组织参加国政府首脑会议的宣言中说：“在北大西洋公约内部，根本没有控制世界的概念的地位。”
    这种说法同现实情况、同资本主义世界的真相距离甚远。自然，帝国主义国家有一些共同的利益，这是垄断资本为维护和巩固整个世界资本主义体系的斗争所决定的。但是，这绝没有消除帝国主义国家之间的那种残酷的、日益剧烈的政治和经济斗争。
    美国、英国、西德、法国和其他国家的大资产阶级结成了“统一战线”，力图维持对劳动人民的剥削和压迫以及对殖民地的奴役；它们想串通一气来镇压工人阶级的革命运动以及殖民地和附属国人民的民族解放斗争。但是，一谈到贪图统治世界资本主义市场的野心，谈到争夺剥削资本主义世界人民的优先权时，各国资产阶级的利益就有根本分歧了。
    垄断资本不断力求保障超额利润，是帝国主义外部矛盾的经济基础。垄断资本追求超额利润促使帝国主义国家疯狂地为争取垄断销售市场、原料产地和投资场所而斗争。
    对市场和投资范围的竞争
    几个主要帝国主义国家间矛盾的尖锐化是现在资本主义发展的最突出的一个特点。自从出现帝国主义以来，垄断联盟从来没有像最近时期这样迫切地需要国外市场和投资场所。这是因为：第一，原来承担很大一部分世界生产和贸易的许多欧洲和亚洲国家脱离了资本主义世界市场而走上了社会主义的道路；第二，获得了独立的不大发达国家的本国工业，特别是重工业的发展，使垄断资本的销售市场缩小了；第三，资本主义国家的军备扩张使生产力和劳动人民购买力之间的矛盾尖锐化了，从而在垄断资本面前提出了必须寻找新市场的问题。
    由于第二次世界大战和战后发展的结果，世界资本主义体系中的主要资本主义国家之间的力量对比发生了变化。美国在世界资本主义工业生产中所占的比重从1937年的41.4％增加到1948年的56.4％。现在美国占世界资本主义工业生产的一半还多一些。
    美国垄断资本所控制的重要工业和军事战略原料，在储量方面，占一半左右，在开采量方面占三分之二左右。美国帝国主义作为资本主义世界主要财政剥削者的作用也大大加强了。这具体地表现在，资本主义世界在战后整个时期的资本输出中，美国占了三分之二以上。资本主义世界三分之二左右的黄金贮备集中在美国资产阶级手里。但是近年来美国资本的经济扩张遭到了包括西德和日本在内的其他资本主义国家越来越大的抵抗。
    工业成品，特别是生产资料，在世界资本主义市场上的竞争非常尖锐。这种市场在世界资本主义贸易体系中，起着主导作用。在这个市场上取得统治地位后，第一可以保证通过不等价的交换优先获取垄断性的高额利润，第二可以控制殖民地和不大发达国家的经济。
    在战后最初几年，争夺资本主义世界工业制成品市场优势的主要是美国和英国。但是，大约从1950年开始，西德也投入了这个斗争，西德在出口制成品方面在很短期间继这两个国家之后而占了第三位。
    世界资本主义工业成品市场上的力量对比继续在起变化。现在占第一位的还是美国，它占世界工业制成品出口总数的25％。但是美国的西德竞争者经济扩张加强了，结果德意志联邦共和国所占的比重从1950年的7.3％，增加到1956年的16％。西德帝国主义者在机器、化学品和小卧车的世界出口方面继美国之后占了第二位。
    日本垄断资本的活动也加紧了。战前，日本工业家主要是在纺织品的输出方面同英、美、德垄断资本竞争。但是现在日本不仅是在纺织品，而且在机器、铁和钢制品、商船等等方面也都是一个大出口国。日本垄断资本特别在英镑区国家的市场加紧活动。1956年日本在世界商船的生产方面，挤掉了英国而越居第一位。
    近几年来，法国和意大利在资本主义世界的工业品出口、特别是在机器出口方面的地位均有下降趋势。
    可见，资本主义世界发展的现阶段中，主要资本主义国家的垄断资本之间的斗争的总趋向是：西德和日本垄断资本的地位不断加强，美国，特别是英国和法国资本受到了排挤。
    现在，美国、西德和法国垄断资本希图通过建立欧洲共同市场来扩大自己的国外市场。但是，西欧共同市场的成立并不能减弱帝国主义国家的斗争的尖锐程度。相反地它只能使这个斗争更加激烈，因为成立共同市场的好处将落在西德和美国垄断资本的手里，而对英国工业巨头的利益则是有损害的。
    战后时期资本输出方面的竞争大大加强了。大家知道，在外国的投资，特别是在不大发达国家的投资，给所有主带来巨额的超额利润。最近几年来，美国“加利福尼亚美孚油公司”和“德士古石油公司”在沙特阿拉伯开采石油的纯利率大约占39％到47％。英荷石油垄断股份公司“英荷壳牌石油公司”1956年的利润率是190％，“英国石油公司”的纯利率是47％。在锡兰、印度和非洲生产茶叶的英国公司“布鲁克·邦德公司”1956年的纯利率是51％，在南非活动的英美垄断资本1956年的纯利是60％。正是为了这种高额利润，帝国主义国家的垄断资本在世界资本市场上为争夺统治地位进行着生死斗争。
    帝国主义国家在世界资本输出方面的力量对比，在战后发生了有利于美国的根本变化。美国在外国的投资从1939年的一百二十五亿美元增加到1956年的四百九十五亿美元。这笔数目比英国、法国、西德、日本和意大利对外国投资的总和超过了好几倍。
    资本主义世界的人民，特别是不大发达国家的人民不得不给美国垄断资本交纳大笔贡税。据美国官方统计材料，从1946年到1956年期间，美国在外国投资的利润是二百六十四亿美元。
    美国在资本输出方面的主要竞争者是英国。战后时期英国的资本输出平均每年约二亿一千万英镑，或者是五亿八千八百万美元。英国投资的主要地区是在英联邦国家。英国资本在英镑地区的地位比美国垄断资本的地位强。
    最近几年来，西德成了美国和英国的危险的竞争者。西德的资本输出量老早就仅次于这两个国家而居第三位。在资本输出方面竞争的加剧自然而然地使帝国主义的外部政治矛盾趋向尖锐化。帝国主义阵营的政治矛盾和经济
    矛盾日益加剧
    美国帝国主义妄想独霸世界。它企图建立那样一种制度，使政治和经济方面的领导权都归到美国大资产阶级的手中，而其他的资本主义国家就变成美国的附庸。
    美国帝国主义控制着拉丁美洲许多国家的政治和经济，控制着以色列、菲律宾、南越、南朝鲜等国家的政治和经济。美帝国主义在西欧的影响在战后大大加强了。可以直截了当地说，在战后资本主义世界里，没有一个角落不感到美国资本的沉重压力，没有一个角落不感到美国垄断资本的压迫和强制。
    美国帝国主义者是北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织这些侵略集团的组织者。对资本主义世界的许多国家说来，美国的军事基地（其中有些已经装备了大规模毁灭性武器）是严重危险的根源。在资本主义世界许多国家的领土上安置这种武器不仅威胁这些国家的主权，而且威胁到这些国家本身的存在。
    帝国主义殖民体系的崩溃使不列颠帝国大大地削弱了。可是如果以为英国帝国主义已经没有能力抵抗美国的攻势，那就太天真了。英国的大资产阶级正在用一切方法巩固它在不列颠帝国内部各国的地位，加紧向拉丁美洲和中近东输出资本和货物，同自己的对手、首先是美国和西德争夺新的销售市场和原料产地。一个著名的保守党活动家埃麦里有一次代表英国大资产阶级的利益说了如下一番话：“在我们许多人的这一辈里，美国跃居独霸世界的地位。为什么拥有大量人力和物力的英联邦不能在下一辈人的一代中赶上甚至超过美国呢？”
    英国帝国主义者在参加侵略集团和支持美国外交政策的同时，也要在国外市场上同这个国家进行剧烈的斗争，他们企图在这个斗争中运用一种新的策略，这个策略的实质是：企图利用美国的支持来维持和巩固不列颠殖民帝国，加强它在资本主义世界的影响。
    法国方面同美国和西德方面存在着深刻的矛盾。法国在经济和政治上越来越落到依靠美国的地步。美国利用所谓“援助”和贷款，把法国从它的殖民地和属地排挤出来，美国控制了南越，渗入了阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和摩洛哥。自然，所有这一切不能不触及到法国垄断资产阶级的深刻的经济利益。法国的垄断资本为了维持法国的殖民地，为了欧洲的销售市场，扩大法国在资本主义国家的势力范围而同美国和德国帝国主义者进行斗争。
    西德在经济和政治上都依靠美国。在许多情况下，美国和西德垄断资本在一些不大发达的国家和西欧国家中采取联合的经济扩张。然而在争取垄断的超额利润的斗争中，它们的利益发生了冲突。
    美国扶植德国帝国主义，就是复活了英国的一个最主要的劲敌，也就是复活了自己的一个竞争者。1956年到1957年是英德、法德以及德美为了在世界资本主义市场上争夺高额利润而竞争的年代。德国帝国主义再次在欧洲市场以及拉丁美洲市场上同英国和美国竞争。德国垄断资本开始迅速地侵入不列颠帝国内部的各国。
    西德力求夺回德国过去在非洲的殖民地。根据瑞典“图画”周刊报道，热尔马·沙赫特博士在写给埃森一批工业巨头的密信中提出了把多哥、法属喀麦隆和比利时的卢安达—乌隆的殖民地归还西德的问题。沙赫特强调指出这些殖民地的价值，特别是蕴藏有丰富铀矿的卢安达—乌隆的的价值，他希望美国支持西德的要求。
    日本日益成为主要帝国主义国家的劲敌。在1951年到1957年期间，日本开始再次大力地把英国排挤出它的传统市场。日本垄断资本不仅和英国资产阶级竞争，而且同美国和西德资本竞争。
    这就是资本主义国家相互关系的真实情况。资本主义战后的全部发展，鲜明地证实了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言所提出的结论，亦即资本主义社会为帝国主义国家之间严重矛盾弄得分崩离析。世界社会主义体系不可分的特色是它的成员国的利益一致，它们坚强的团结，而资本主义阵营的特点是内外矛盾日益增长，彼此发生激烈的竞争，日益激烈地为夺取销售市场和投资范围而斗争。这表明了世界资本主义的寄生性和腐朽性。
