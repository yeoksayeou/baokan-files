The revised second edition of "A Concise History of China" written by Fan Wenlan, will soon be published by the People's Publishing House. The second edition begins with the Qin unification in 221 BC and ends with the Sui dynasty's destruction of the Chen dynasty in 589 AD, which, according to the author's periodization, is equivalent to the early stage of the middle period of Chinese feudal society. This edition adds some new chapters and new arguments. The author further demonstrates the argument that the four characteristics of the Han nationality were initially possessed since the Qin and Han dynasties, and comprehensively explains the social nature of the Qin, Han, Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties. A comprehensive analysis and discussion is also made on the causes and development of the various major peasant uprisings.
