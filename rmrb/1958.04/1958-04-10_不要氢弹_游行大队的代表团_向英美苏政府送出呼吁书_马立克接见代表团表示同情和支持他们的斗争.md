Xinhua News Agency, London, April 8th: A delegation sent by participants in the "Ban the Hydrogen Bomb" march from London to Aldermaston today delivered copies of the resolution passed at the Aldermaston mass rally to British Prime Minister Macmillan, as well as the Soviet and American ambassadors in London. The resolution calls on the governments of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States to immediately cease the testing, production, and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. Over three thousand people signed the resolution.

The British Prime Minister's private secretary received the delegation at 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's official residence in London.

Dr. Soper, head of the Methodist Church and leader of the delegation, said: "We told the Prime Minister's secretary that our march is the beginning of our efforts, not the end. We believe that the thousands of people who participated in the march represent millions of people, because some people cannot participate in the march in person."

When the delegation arrived at the Soviet Embassy, Soviet Ambassador Malik received the delegation. British Labour Party MP Brockway presented the resolution to Malik on behalf of the marchers. He pointed out that the Soviet Union had set a good example by passing a resolution to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing. He expressed the hope that Britain and the United States would follow the Soviet Union and resolve the entire issue of banning the production of nuclear weapons and destroying nuclear weapons stockpiles in the near future.

Malik thanked the delegation and expressed his admiration for the heroism shown by the marchers in their long march. Malik said that the Soviet people are watching your struggle with great sympathy and fully support the humanitarian goals of this struggle.

    “不要氢弹”游行大队的代表团
    向英美苏政府送出呼吁书
    马立克接见代表团表示同情和支持他们的斗争
    新华社伦敦8日电　参加了从伦敦到阿尔德马斯顿“不要氢弹”大游行的人们派出的代表团今天把在阿尔德马斯顿群众大会上通过的决议抄本分别送交英国首相麦克米伦以及苏联和美国驻伦敦大使。这项决议呼吁苏联、英国和美国政府立即停止试验、生产和储存核武器。在这项决议书上签名的有三千多人。
    英国首相的私人秘书在伦敦唐宁街十号英国首相官邸接见了代表团。
    代表团团长、卫理公会会长索佩尔博士说：“我们对首相的秘书说，我们的游行是我们的努力的开始，而不是结束。我们认为，参加游行的几千人是好几百万人的代表，因为有些人不可能亲自参加游行。”
    当代表团到达苏联大使馆时，苏联大使马立克接见了代表团。英国工党议员布罗克威代表游行群众把决议交给了马立克。他指出，苏联通过了单方面停止试验核武器的决议因而作出了一个好榜样。他表示希望，英国和美国仿效苏联，在最近期间内解决整个禁止生产核武器和销毁核武器储存的问题。
    马立克对代表团人员表示感谢，并且对游行群众在长途游行中所表现的英勇气概表示钦佩。马立克说，苏联人民非常同情地注视着你们的斗争，并且完全支持这个斗争的人道目标。
