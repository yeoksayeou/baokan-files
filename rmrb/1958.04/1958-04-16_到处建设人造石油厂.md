Inner Mongolia
Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 12th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has never had a petroleum industry, will build two synthetic oil plants this year, with an annual output of 6,000 tons of synthetic oil.

These two synthetic oil plants will be built in Guyang County in the Ulanqab League and Dongsheng County in the Ikezhao League. The Ministry of Petroleum Industry is designing these two plants. The refinery in Dongsheng County has already begun to organize technical forces to carry out preparatory work such as ordering machinery and selecting factory sites.

Inner Mongolia is rich in synthetic oil resources. Oil shale, which can be refined into oil, has been discovered in the Ikezhao League, Ulanqab League, Zhaowuda League, and Hulunbuir League. The large amount of oil refining coal produced in Inner Mongolia is also a good resource for synthetic oil.

Yichang
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 12th: Yichang City, Hubei Province, is preparing to build a synthetic oil plant that uses pine resin as raw material. After the plant is completed, it can use pine resin to refine more than 6,000 tons of oil annually.

Extracting oil from pine resin was first successfully tested by engineering technicians in Hunan Province. After evaporating, refining, and acid washing the pine resin, gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, insulating oil, asphalt, and other finished products can be obtained, with a recovery rate of about 70%. 50% of the finished products are gasoline and diesel.

After learning of this news, the industrial departments of Hubei Province dispatched personnel to Changsha, Hunan Province, to study this technology. Yichang, Enshi, Huanggang, and Xiangyang four regions in Hubei Province are rich in pine trees, with an estimated annual output of 70,000 tons of pine resin. If all of them are used to refine oil, more than 20,000 tons of gasoline and diesel can be produced.

Jinxi
According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 15th: Jinxi County, Liaoning Province, has begun to build a small "stack-type coal low-temperature dry distillation" oil refinery. After the plant is completed, it will produce more than 600 tons of crude oil annually, and can refine gasoline, diesel, kerosene, and coke.

The oil refining method of "stack-type low-temperature dry distillation" using coal was recently successfully tested by the State-owned Petroleum Plant No. 5. Using this method to refine oil, the oil yield is high. Every ton of coal with an oil content of 12% can refine 70 kilograms of crude oil. Small refineries of this kind can be built in general coal-producing areas. Its characteristics are: small scale, fast construction, low investment, high efficiency, simple technology, and easy operation. The required materials can be solved locally. The equipment of this kind of oil refinery is also very simple, and local machinery industry departments can manufacture it.

    到处建设人造石油厂
    内蒙古
    新华社呼和浩特12日电　从来没有石油工业的内蒙古自治区今年将要办起两个人造石油厂，年产人造石油六千吨。
    这两个人造石油厂决定建在乌兰察布盟的固阳县和伊克昭盟的东胜县。石油工业部正在为这两个厂设计。东胜县的炼油厂并已开始组织技术力量，进行订购机械和选择厂址等筹建工作。
    内蒙古人造石油资源丰富，能提炼石油的油母页岩矿已在伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟、昭乌达盟和呼伦贝尔盟等地先后发现。内蒙古出产的大量炼油煤也是人造石油的良好资源。
    宜　昌
    新华社武汉12日电　湖北省宜昌市正在筹建一座利用松树脂作原料的人造石油厂。这个厂建成后，每年可以利用松树脂提炼石油六千多吨。
    从松脂中提炼石油，是湖南省的工程技术人员首先试验成功的。把松树脂拿来蒸发、精溜、酸洗后，便可得出汽油、柴油、滑润油、绝缘油、沥青等成品，回收率达70％左右。成品中有50％是汽油和柴油。
    湖北省工业部门得知这个消息后，已派出专人到湖南长沙学习这一技术。湖北省的宜昌、恩施、黄冈、襄阳四个专区都盛产松树，估计年产松脂七万吨。如果全部用来提炼石油，就可以生产汽油和柴油两万多吨。
    锦　西
    据新华社沈阳15日电　辽宁省锦西县开始建设一座小型“堆式煤炭低温干馏”炼油厂。这个厂建成后将年产六百多吨原油，并能提炼出汽油、柴油、灯油、焦炭。
    利用煤炭进行“堆式低温干馏”的炼油法，是国营石油五厂最近试验成功的。用这种方法炼油，出油率高，每吨含油12％的煤，可以炼出七十公斤原油。一般产煤地区都可以建设这种小型炼油厂。它的特点是：规模小、建设快、投资少、收效大、技术简单、容易操作。所需要的材料在当地就可以解决。这种炼油厂的设备也很简单，地方机械工业部门都能制造。
