    Where Does the "Cold Eye" Come From?
    Former U.S. President Truman, at a hearing in the U.S. Senate on the 14th, talked about his prescription for treating the current economic crisis. Originally, the crisis occurred in the United States, and the root cause lies in the American economic system. However, Truman immediately said that "the Russians are watching us with cold eyes," intentionally diverting the attention of the American people from the crisis to the Soviet Union. Has the Soviet Union been giving the U.S. economic crisis a "cold eye"? Just four days before Truman's speech, the Soviet representative at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe suggested convening a ministerial meeting to discuss economic cooperation. The Soviet Union openly stated its belief in international cooperation and its sympathy for the American working people suffering from the crisis. Is this concern or a "cold eye"?
    It is worth noting that the most important ingredient in Truman's prescription for the economic crisis is "increasing defense spending." Obviously, what the American people need now is not guns and bombs. This medicine is prescribed for the American monopoly capitalist groups. The reason for Truman's fabrication of the "cold eye" lie is thus completely revealed.

### 何来“冷眼”

    何来“冷眼”
    前美国总统杜鲁门，14日在美国参议院的一个意见听取会上，谈了他的治疗当前经济危机的药方。本来，危机发生在美国，病根在于美国的经济制度，但是杜鲁门一开口就说“俄国人正在冷眼看着我们”，他有意把美国人民对危机的注意力引到苏联身上。苏联对美国的经济危机“冷眼”了吗？就在杜鲁门谈话的前四天，苏联代表在联合国欧洲经济委员会上还建议召开部长级会议，讨论经济合作问题。苏联光明正大地表明了对于国际合作的信念和对于遭受危机灾难的美国劳动人民的同情。这是关怀，还是“冷眼”呢？
    值得注意的是杜鲁门为经济危机开的药方，最主要的一味药就是“增加国防费用”。显然，美国人民当前需要的并不是枪炮炸弹。这一味药是开给美国垄断资本集团的。杜鲁门制造“冷眼”谎言的原因就这样完全泄了底。
