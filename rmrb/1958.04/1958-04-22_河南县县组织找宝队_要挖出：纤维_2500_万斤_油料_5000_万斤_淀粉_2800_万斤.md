    Henan Counties Organize Treasure Hunting Teams
    To Excavate: 25 Million Jin of Fiber, 50 Million Jin of Oilseed, 28 Million Jin of Starch
    (Our Zhengzhou dispatch, 21st) Henan Province plans to produce 25 million jin of wild fiber, 50 million jin of wild oilseed, and 28 million jin of wild starch this year. In order to achieve this plan and make full use of wild plants, all counties in the province will organize exploration teams to go into the mountains to find treasures. The wild plant exploration team organized by the Provincial Commercial Department's Native Products Bureau found many wild plant materials that can be used to manufacture fiber and starch in Xichuan, Neixiang, Nanyang and other counties in the Nanyang area. This year, Henan Province also plans to establish more than 1,000 comprehensive processing plants in 54 counties rich in wild plant materials, so that funds and processing can go up the mountains together, and the purchased raw materials can be processed into finished or semi-finished products and transported down the mountains in order to solve the difficulty of inconvenient transportation. Shangcheng County in the Dabie Mountain area has now established small processing plants for pine oil, native paper, starch, and fiber. Recently, after Xichuan, Xixia, Gushi, Xinyang and other counties successfully trial-produced artificial cotton and artificial fiber from ramie and rice straw, more than a dozen counties have visited them. The Provincial Commercial Department's Native Products Bureau also sent a working group to help summarize experience, and also sent people to Sichuan Province to learn in order to further improve processing quality.

    河南县县组织找宝队
    要挖出：纤维2500万斤　油料5000万斤　淀粉2800万斤
    本报郑州21日电　河南省今年计划生产野生纤维二千五百万斤，野生油料五千万斤，野生淀粉二千八百万斤。为了实现这个计划，把野生植物都充分利用起来，全省各个县都将组织勘查大队，上山找宝。省商业厅土产局组织的野生植物勘查队在南阳专区淅川、内乡、南阳等县找到了许多可以制造纤维和淀粉的野生植物原料。河南省今年还计划在五十四个盛产野生植物原料的县建立一千多个综合性的加工厂，使资金、加工齐上山，把收购的原料加工成成品或半成品运下山，以便解决运输不便的困难。大别山区的商城县现在就已建立了松油、土纸、淀粉、纤维等小型加工厂。最近淅川、西峡、固始、信阳等县用龙须草、稻草试制人造棉花、人造纤维成功以后，已经有十多个县去参观。省商业厅土产局还派去工作组帮助总结经验，并且还派人到四川省学习，以便进一步提高加工质量。　（方徨）
