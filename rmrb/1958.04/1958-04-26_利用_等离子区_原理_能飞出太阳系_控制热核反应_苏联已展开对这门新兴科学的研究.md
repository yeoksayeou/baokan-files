Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 25th: A recent issue of the Soviet magazine "Young Technology" stated that by utilizing the so-called "plasma zone" principle, it is possible to realize the ideal of spaceflight beyond the solar system, achieve controllable thermonuclear reactions, manufacture extremely small yet highly powerful electronic accelerators, and fundamentally change the technological processes in metallurgical, chemical, and other industrial sectors.

The article published in "Young Technology" introduced the research on plasma zones that has already been launched in the Soviet Union and provided a general introduction to this emerging scientific field. The article pointed out, "The terms 'plasma zone,' 'plasma zone spacecraft,' and 'plasma zone chemistry' will undoubtedly become as common as 'electricity,' 'electric motor,' and 'electrochemistry' in the near future."

The article pointed out that in the past, it was believed that there were three forms of matter in nature: solid, liquid, and gas. Now, it should be recognized that there is a fourth form: the plasma state. A plasma zone is formed when a gas is heated to a very high temperature or when an electric current or radiation is passed through a rarefied gas. In the plasma state, some molecules of the gas lose one or more electrons and become positive ions, while the electrons that escape from the molecules remain within the plasma zone. In addition, the plasma zone also contains some ordinary unionized gas molecules. The entire plasma zone is electrically neutral because the positive and negative charges are equal.

Astrophysicists have discovered that the universe is basically composed of plasma. The sun, many stars, and nebulae are almost entirely composed of plasma. Therefore, studying the laws of plasma helps to better understand the laws of the universe. The ionosphere in the Earth's atmosphere (the high altitude above 80 kilometers from the Earth's surface) is also composed of plasma.

The article reported that the Soviet Union is conducting work on achieving controllable thermonuclear reactions using powerful pulsed plasma zones. Soviet scientists have also proposed using this principle to manufacture plasma electronic accelerators that are small, only a few meters in diameter, but extremely powerful and do not require iron. Future spaceflights, especially those aiming to fly out of the solar system, can also be achieved using ion rockets as engines. These rockets can eject plasma particles accelerated to near the speed of light, giving the rockets tremendous speed. Once research on utilizing plasma as a source of long-term high temperatures of tens of thousands of degrees is completed, the technological processes in metallurgical, chemical, and other industrial sectors will undergo fundamental changes due to the increase in the highest temperature limits achievable in technology.

    利用“等离子区”原理
    能飞出太阳系  控制热核反应
    苏联已展开对这门新兴科学的研究
    新华社莫斯科25日电　苏联最近一期“青年技术”杂志说，利用所谓“等离子区”原理，可以实现飞出太阳系的宇宙飞行理想，实现可控制的热核反应，制造体积极小而能力极大的电子加速器，使冶金、化学等工业部门的工艺过程发生根本变化。
    “青年技术”发表的文章介绍了在苏联已经展开的对于等离子区的研究，并且对这门正在兴起的科学部门作了概要介绍。文章指出，
  “等离子区”、“等离子区飞船”、“等离子区化学”等名词毫无疑问在不久的将来就会成为像“电力”、“电动机”、“电化学”一样普通的名词。
    文章指出，过去认为自然界物质存在形式一共有三种，即固体、液体、气体，现在应当认为还有第四种，即等离子区状态。等离子区是由于气体被加热到很高温度或者以电流或射线通过稀薄气体形成的。在等离子区状态中，气体的部分分子失去了一个或几个电子，而变成正离子，而从分子内跑出来的电子依然存在于等离子区内。此外等离子区中还包含一些普通的未游离的气体分子。整个等离子区的正、负电是相等的，因此在带电性质上说是中性的。
    天体物理学家发现，宇宙基本上就是由等离子区组成的。太阳、许多恒星和星云几乎完全是由等离子区组成的。因此，对等离子区规律的研究有助于更好地理解宇宙的规律。地球大气层中的电离层（距地球表面八十公里以上的高空）也是由等离子区组成的。
    文章报道，苏联正在进行利用强力脉冲等离子区实现可控制热核反应的工作。苏联科学家还提出了一种主张，要利用这个原理制造体积小到只有直径几公尺而能力却极其强大的、不用铁的等离子区电子加速器。未来的宇宙飞行，特别是要飞出太阳系去，也可以利用离子火箭做发动机来实现，这种火箭可以喷射出加速到接近光速的等离子区粒子，使火箭具有极大的速度。利用等离子区作为长期保持几万度高温的源泉的研究完成以后，由于提高了技术中所达到的温度最高极限，冶金、化学等工业部门的工艺过程就会发生根本变化。
