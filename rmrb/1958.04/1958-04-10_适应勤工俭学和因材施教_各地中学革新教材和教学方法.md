    Adapting Work-Study Programs and Tailoring Education to Individual Aptitudes:
    Middle Schools Across the Country Innovate Teaching Materials and Methods
    (Reported by this newspaper) Middle schools across the country are implementing numerous innovations in teaching content and teaching methods.
    Since the Central Committee issued the call for work-study programs, these activities have seen new and widespread development in middle schools across the country. This has brought new problems in arranging teaching and labor time; the shortcomings of teaching materials being divorced from the realities of industrial and agricultural production have also been prominently exposed; many regions have taken concrete measures to solve these problems.
    Regarding the arrangement of teaching and labor time, there are roughly the following methods: one is to study without being separated from production, i.e., part-work, part-study; another is to implement work-study programs using spare time and holidays; and a third is to occupy a portion of class time each week (one day or two afternoons, etc.) to participate in production labor. Regarding teaching materials, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Municipal Education Bureau, Shanghai's ordinary middle schools have launched discussions on the reform of teaching materials, and after reaching conclusions, have implemented reforms. Some schools are now preparing to merge literature and Chinese language courses, combining the teaching of grammar and rhetoric with literature lessons. Teachers have decided to go to factories and villages during the spring break to collect materials to address the lack of practical knowledge of production skills in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology textbooks; and they will supplement the applied skills teaching materials. General history and geography textbooks are being streamlined, supplemented with local historical materials, climate, geographical environment, and other materials.
    At present, in addition to ordinary middle schools, agricultural middle schools (including forestry middle schools, sericulture middle schools, etc.) and vocational middle schools have also emerged. These schools have developed like mushrooms after rain in Jiangsu Province. In Nanjing alone, 248 private agricultural and other vocational middle schools had been established by March 23. With the emergence of these schools, there have been changes in school curricula and teaching plans. One type of teaching plan is the ordinary middle school teaching plan issued by the Ministry of Education. Most ordinary middle schools in various regions conduct teaching according to this teaching plan, and some regions have made adjustments to the school calendar, such as changing winter and summer vacations to agricultural busy season vacations and Spring Festival vacations, etc. The second type of teaching plan is the agricultural middle school teaching plan. For example, agricultural middle schools in the Yancheng Special District of Jiangsu generally only offer four subjects: politics, Chinese, mathematics, and agricultural knowledge. If possible, they also learn some biology, physics, chemistry, and hygiene knowledge. Teaching time is tentatively set at eighteen periods per week. Among them, Chinese includes practical writing, six periods per week; mathematics includes abacus calculation, simple bookkeeping, surveying, etc., six periods per week; agricultural knowledge class includes meteorology, soil, fertilizer, water conservancy, planting, farm tools, plant diseases and insect pests, etc., five periods per week; and politics class one period per week, mainly teaching political common sense, and participating in social activities during major political movements. The third type of teaching plan is the vocational middle school teaching plan. For example, vocational middle schools in Nanjing are tentatively scheduled to have five subjects: Chinese, politics, mathematics, physics and chemistry, basic knowledge of production, and physical education and hygiene.
    In terms of teaching methods, middle schools in various regions have also made some reforms, the most obvious of which are in biology and agricultural knowledge classes. For example, the biology class at Yongxin Middle School in Jiangxi is taught on the school farm, and their slogan is "Crops are textbooks; the farm is the classroom." When teaching agricultural knowledge, Nanjing Xiaolingwei Middle School takes students to the fields and specially invites old farmers to speak to the students while guiding them to operate by hand. The school's biology teachers then compile the things the old farmers talk about into teaching materials. In addition, the teaching of socialist politics classes has basically gotten rid of the dogmatic tendency of simply imparting textbook knowledge and is better able to conduct education in light of the students' actual thoughts. The reform of political class teaching is mainly reflected in two aspects: one is to organize students to conduct thematic debates, and the other is to conduct ideological and political education for students through production labor.

    适应勤工俭学和因材施教
    各地中学革新教材和教学方法
    本报讯　各地中学在教学内容和教学方法等方面进行许多革新。
  自从中央提出勤工俭学的号召之后，各地中学的勤工俭学活动有新的广泛的开展。使教学和劳动时间的安排上出现新的问题；教材内容脱离工农业生产实际的缺点也突出的暴露出来；许多地区已采取具体措施加以解决。
    在教学和劳动时间的安排上，大致有这样几种办法：一种是学习不脱离生产，半工半读；一种是利用课余时间和假日实行勤工俭学；再一种是每周占用一部分上课时间
  （一天或两个下午不等）参加生产劳动。在教材方面，上海市各普通中学在中共上海市委和市教育局领导下，在学校内展开了对于改革教材的鸣放和讨论，得出结论后即行改革。现在有一些学校准备把文学和汉语课合并，结合文学课讲授语法和修辞。在数、理、化和生物学等教材中缺少生产技能方面的实际知识，教师们决定在春假期间下厂下乡去收集资料；把应用的技能教材补充进去。一般性的历史地理教材准备精减，补充本乡本土的史料、气候、地理环境等材料。
    目前，除了普通中学以外，还出现农业中学（林业中学、蚕桑中学等包括在内）和职业中学。这种学校在江苏省已经像雨后春笋般地发展起来。仅南京市一地，到3月23日已成立民办农业和其他职业中学二百四十八所。随着这种学校的出现，学校的课程设置、教学计划也有了改变。一种教学计划是教育部颁发的普通中学的教学计划。各地普通中学大都按照这个教学计划进行教学，有些地区学校在校历方面作了调整，例如把寒、暑假改为放农忙假和春节假，等等。第二种教学计划是农业中学的教学计划。例如江苏盐城专区的农业中学，一般只设政治、语文、数学、农业知识四门，有可能，还学一些生物、理化和卫生知识。教学时间暂订每周十八节。其中语文包括应用文，每周六节；数学包括珠算、简单簿记、测量等，每周六节；农业知识课，包括气象、土壤、肥料、水利、种植、农具、病虫害等等，每周五节；政治课每周一节，主要教政治常识，在大的政治运动时期就参加社会活动。第三种教学计划是职业中学的教学计划。例如南京市的职业中学，暂定为语文、政治、数学、理化、生产基础知识、体育卫生等五种学科。
    在教学方法上，各地中学也有若干改革，其中最明显的是生物课和农业知识课。例如江西永新中学的生物课就在学校农场里上，他们的口号是“作物当课本；农场当课堂”。南京孝陵卫中学，在讲授农业知识时，把学生带到田里，特地请老农民一面对学生讲，一面指导学生亲手操作，该校的生物教师则把老农民讲的东西编成教材。另外，关于社会主义政治课的教学，已经基本上摆脱了单纯传授课本知识的教条主义倾向，比较能结合学生的思想实际进行教育。政治课教学的改革主要表现在两方面，一方面组织学生进行专题辩论，另一方面通过生产劳动对学生进行思想政治教育。　（柳维光）
