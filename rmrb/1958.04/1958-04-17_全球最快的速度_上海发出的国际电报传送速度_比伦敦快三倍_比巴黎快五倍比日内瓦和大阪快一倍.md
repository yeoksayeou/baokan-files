    The World's Fastest Speed
    Shanghai's International Telegram Transmission Speed
    Is Three Times Faster Than London
    Five Times Faster Than Paris and Twice as Fast as Geneva and Osaka
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th - The transmission speed of international telegrams sent from Shanghai not only far surpasses that of foreign counterpart bureaus, but also breaks the current highest time limit standard for international telegram transmission speed. On the 15th, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issued a special circular to the postal and telecommunications departments of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, commending the outstanding achievements made by the comrades in the International Telegram Room of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau in the Great Leap Forward.
    Statistical data from the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau from March 11th to 20th shows that the average time required for ordinary telegrams sent from Shanghai to London, Paris, Geneva, and Osaka has been shortened to 11 minutes and 22 seconds to 12 minutes and 53 seconds. Compared with the time required for each telegram sent by foreign counterpart bureaus during the same statistical period, Shanghai's speed is three times faster than London, five times faster than Paris, and twice as fast as Geneva and Osaka.
    Currently, the highest time limit standard for international telegram transmission speed is: 75% of telegrams sent from the originating bureau should be transmitted to the receiving bureau within 30 minutes. However, 94.8% to 100% of international telegrams sent from Shanghai to the above-mentioned places are transmitted to the other bureau within 30 minutes; among them, 74.6% to 82.3% of telegrams are transmitted within 15 minutes.
    The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau also performs very well in terms of the accuracy of international telegrams. For example, a total of 110,084 international telegrams were sent and received in March, with not a single error.
    The speed with which Shanghai replies to inquiry telegrams from London has greatly surprised London's telegraph operators. Recently, the Osaka Telegraph Branch of the Japan International Telecommunications and Telephone Workers' Union wrote a letter to all telegraph operators in the International Telegram Room of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, stating that among the Osaka Telegraph Bureau's sixteen international circuits, Shanghai is the best circuit in terms of accuracy, speed, and technology.

    全球最快的速度
    上海发出的国际电报传送速度
    比伦敦快三倍
    比巴黎快五倍比日内瓦和大阪快一倍
    据新华社16日讯　从上海发出的国际电报的传送速度，不但远远胜过国外对方局，而且还突破了目前国际电报传送速度的最高时限标准。邮电部在15日特向全国各省、市、自治区邮电部门发出通报，对上海市电报局国际报务室工作同志在大跃进中取得的这一卓越成绩，予以表扬。
    上海电报局3月11日到20日的统计资料表明，从上海发到伦敦、巴黎、日内瓦和大阪等地的普通电报，平均每份需要的时间缩短到十一分二十二秒到十二分五十三秒。同国外对方局在同一统计时间内发来的每份电报需要的时间比较，上海的速度比伦敦快三倍，比巴黎快五倍，比日内瓦和大阪快一倍。
    目前，国际电报传送速度的最高时限标准是：从发报局所在地点发出的电报应有75％在三十分钟内传送到收报局。而从上海发往上述几个地方的国际电报，有94.8％到100％是在三十分钟内传送到对方局的；其中有74.6％到82.3％的电报是在十五分钟内就传送到的。
    上海电报局在国际电报的正确性方面，也做得很好。如3月份来去的国际电报总共达十一万零八十四份，一次差错也没有。
    上海回复伦敦的查询电报的迅速，使伦敦报务员们大为惊奇。最近日本国际电信电话工会大阪电报支部写给上海电报局国际报务室全体报务员的一封信说，在大阪电报局的十六条国际电路中，在正确、迅速和技术方面，上海是最好的一条电路。
