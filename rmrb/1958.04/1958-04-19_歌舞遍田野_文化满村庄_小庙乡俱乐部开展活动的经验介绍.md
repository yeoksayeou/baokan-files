    We had heard long ago that the clubs in Xiaomiao Township, Hubei, were run exceptionally well. After visiting recently, it was truly well-deserved, or as they themselves put it, "Song and dance fill the fields, culture fills the villages." What's particularly gratifying is that the clubs here are not only places for the peasant masses to enjoy themselves, but more importantly, they have become ideological positions for carrying out socialist propaganda among the peasant masses.

    Currently, all seventeen agricultural cooperatives in Xiaomiao Township have "established departments in every cooperative, and every department has groups." They closely coordinate with the Party's various tasks, especially each stage of production, using diverse forms to carry out propaganda and mobilization work for current events, policies, and production, and have achieved great results. The propaganda and mobilization forms of the clubs in this township are numerous, including big-character posters, mobile clapper talks, blackboards, cartoons, exhibitions, field propaganda boards, loudspeakers, lectures, question-and-answer sessions, storytelling, Tianmen Flower Drum opera, song and dance dramas, folk songs, choruses, clapper talks, and literary and art evenings, totaling forty-five types. These innovative and popular propaganda and mobilization forms have generally been made regular.

    Here, whether it's older people or young people, whether it's township or cooperative leading cadres or ordinary members, everyone praises and loves the diverse activities of the clubs. Many people have received a profound education through the clubs' activities. Some say that the club is a spare-time school for self-education. Not long ago, some members of Happiness First Cooperative developed complacency, lacked drive, and some even held the attitude of: "Whether it's a thousand catties or not, I'll get my work points anyway," only caring about grabbing work points, regardless of the quality of work. Some members did not cherish the cooperative's public property, leaving production tools wherever they used them. Of the cooperative's fifty-nine head of draft cattle, twenty-four were fed poorly and became weak. Some members also encountered difficulties in life due to extravagance and waste. In response to this situation, the cooperative's club held an exhibition in March on the theme of patriotism, love for the cooperative, and thrift, using pictures, objects, and methods of comparing good and bad examples. This exhibition closely grasped typical examples from the masses, and educated the masses through praise and criticism, making it very lively and vivid. For example, there was a picture in the exhibition depicting an old man working diligently in the rain, with the inscription: "Li Niuren of the Fourth Team, over sixty years old, gets up early and works late, outperforming others, working diligently in both sunny and rainy weather." In the same picture, there was also a seemingly young person sitting at home: "Li Chuanqing of the Fourth Team, younger than Niuren, stays at home when others are working (meaning he has nothing to do), only tending his vegetable garden, ignoring the cooperative's Great Leap Forward." The exhibition praised many members who cherished the cooperative's public property and were diligent and thrifty in managing their households, and criticized members who damaged farm tools, mistreated draft cattle, and did not pay attention to the quality of their work. This gave the members a profound education. Many members, after seeing it, voluntarily examined their shortcomings and mistakes. Zeng Qianxi was originally the most famous "lazy woman" in the cooperative, having only done more than ten workdays throughout last year. Recently, she seems to have transformed into a different person, working tirelessly from morning to night, and in just over half a month, she earned more work points than she did in the entire previous year.

    In Xiaomiao Township, the clubs not only actively criticize but also pay more attention to praising good people and good deeds to encourage the masses to move forward. The Seventh Production Team of the Lighthouse Sixth Cooperative, every day when the sky was barely visible, the members would get up and go to Yuekou Town, several miles away, to accumulate manure. The club then posted a big-character poster praising them: "The members of the Seventh Team are highly motivated, not afraid of wind and rain or slippery roads, men and women, old and young, all set off together, carrying fertilizer from the streets back home. This is the result of the captain's good leadership, hoping they will carry it forward in the future." This motivated the entire cooperative, and the next day, more than four hundred people from the entire cooperative participated in manure accumulation. The entire cooperative, with one burst of energy, accumulated more than 8,000 dan of manure in just five days.

    Another characteristic of the clubs in Xiaomiao Township closely coordinating with the central tasks is that when the central tasks arrive, in addition to quickly organizing forces to carry out written and verbal propaganda, the artistic performances are also more active at this time. Generally, they adopt the approach of concentrating during slack farming seasons and dispersing during busy farming seasons; concentrating on rainy days and dispersing on sunny days; concentrating at night and dispersing during the day. Therefore, whether it is a busy or slack farming season, the clubs' activities never stop. The vast majority of the performance materials are created by the farmers themselves, and in compiling these performance materials, they generally "grasp production, grasp ideology, and grasp typical examples." This makes the content more closely related to reality, and the effect is greater. For example, last summer, this area suffered a rare drought, and the green cotton leaves withered day by day. At this time, Wang Peihua, a young member of Happiness Second Cooperative, took the lead in watering and reviving five mu of cotton that was about to die. The club then compiled this deed into a "Cotton Drought Resistance" ditty and performed it everywhere. As a result, the historical habit of never watering cotton here was changed, and a hot and fiery struggle against drought was launched. In this way, more than forty mu of cotton that was most severely threatened by drought in the entire cooperative at that time were all saved. In order to closely coordinate with production and promote production, many clubs have achieved "gathering materials locally, creating, writing, and performing based on what is being done." When it was time to sow cotton, they wrote and sang "Ten Dos and Ten Don'ts for Cotton Sowing," "Cotton Technology Clapper Talk," and so on. When carrying out activities such as building water conservancy projects, accumulating manure, learning culture, and eliminating the four pests, they wrote and sang many song and dance dramas, big drum ballads, fisherman's drum ballads, clapper talks, and comic dialogues targeting the different contents mentioned above, which played a significant role in promoting these tasks.

    Because the clubs' activities are rich and colorful and have been regularized, they have greatly enlivened the cultural life of the masses, changed the original appearance of the countryside, and presented a prosperous and vibrant atmosphere everywhere. Here, the general situation is that the teams perform small shows every seven days, the cooperatives perform big shows every half month, and the township holds a joint performance every month. When farm work is busy, the performers are scattered in various teams. When drawing water, they lead the members in singing water-drawing songs, when threshing wheat, they sing wheat-threshing songs, and when transplanting rice seedlings, they sing rice-transplanting songs. Almost everyone can hum and sing these songs. Even some elderly men and women happily produce and sing songs together with young people. Many young men and women can tie red and green ribbons around their waists at any time, jump up, and sing. Sometimes, they even hold song and dance evenings under the moonlight at night. In addition, whenever there is a slack farming season, various ball games are also launched. Basketball and table tennis are the most popular activities among farmers.

    The clubs have also played a great role in popularizing cultural knowledge and spreading production technology. At present, sixteen amateur creation groups have been established in the township. In the past two or three months, they have created more than fifty scripts, folk songs, clapper talks, big drum ballads, and so on. At the same time, during the process of rehearsing plays, through copying words and reciting lines, many actors have also learned culture. The vast majority of actors started as illiterate or semi-literate, but now they can recognize six or seven hundred characters, and the most can recognize about one thousand five hundred characters. Some have already started creating. In order to disseminate production technology, in addition to regular dissemination through performances, blackboards, and other forms, the role of field propaganda boards is also very important. For example, during last year's cotton disaster resistance and yield increase campaign, the clubs wrote down the measures that should be taken for each field on the propaganda boards. The Fengling Fourth Cooperative wrote on the field propaganda boards: "Early-stage barren seedlings, late-stage barren peaches, eliminate weeds," "Three times of cultivating high, hoeing bubbles between rows, reducing evaporation, preventing drought and waterlogging," and so on. Every time the propaganda boards were changed, the members would say: "Another prescription has arrived."

    Xiaomiao Township clubs were established as early as 1954, and they have persisted well for several years, with activities never interrupted throughout the year. Why are the Xiaomiao Township clubs doing so well? This is mainly due to the township Party organization's emphasis, adopting the method of strengthening leadership at all levels and assigning responsibilities to ensure that the clubs' work is seriously grasped. The township general branch deputy secretary and propaganda committee member are responsible for leading the clubs' work in the entire township. The club director is concurrently held by the cooperative's Party branch secretary. In addition, the deputy secretary or committee member of the Communist Youth League branch is specially assigned to lead the clubs. Each club has established a League group. The township Party general branch promptly puts forward requirements, points out the direction of activities, and explains the methods of activities based on the production season and the clubs' activities. This is the key to making the clubs closely integrate with the central tasks and serve politics and production.

    Experience has proven that regularly educating the members of the clubs is also an important measure to consolidate the clubs. Xiaomiao Township's approach is: carrying out competitions, regularly evaluating models, rewarding advanced individuals, conducting small evaluations every month, large evaluations every quarter, and a general evaluation every year. In this way, many club members are both labor experts in production and models in propaganda work, as well as leaders in various central tasks. In order to improve the quality of activities, the township has also established a central club to form a township-wide club network. The central club has set up a business teaching station to regularly conduct business knowledge teaching and also frequently holds some demonstration activities to attract general clubs to visit. Now, the Party organization of this township is further strengthening its leadership over the clubs, striving to improve the quality of activities, and making the clubs also make a Great Leap Forward in the sound of the Great Leap Forward horn.

    歌舞遍田野　文化满村庄
    ——小庙乡俱乐部开展活动的经验介绍
    本报记者　田庄　罗重璋
    我们早就听说湖北小庙乡的俱乐部办得呱呱叫，最近到这里访问以后，果真名不虚传，用他们自己的话来说，是“歌舞遍田野，文化满村庄”。特别令人高兴的，这里的俱乐部不仅是农民群众进行自我娱乐的场所，更重要的是，已经成为向农民群众进行社会主义宣传的思想阵地。
    目前，小庙乡十七个农业社，已经“社社建部、部部有团”。它们密切配合党的各项工作，特别是每一个阶段的生产，运用多种多样的形式，进行时事、政策和生产的宣传鼓动工作，收到了很大效果。这个乡俱乐部的宣传鼓动形式繁多。其中有大字报、流动快板、黑板报、漫画、展览、田间鼓动牌、广播筒、讲座、问题解答、说书、天沔花鼓、歌舞剧、民歌、合唱、快板、文艺晚会等四十五种。这些花样翻新，喜闻乐见的宣传鼓动形式，一般都已做到了经常化。
    在这里，无论是上了年纪的人还是小伙子，也无论是乡、社领导干部还是普通社员，对俱乐部多种多样的活动，人人夸赞，个个喜欢。许多人通过俱乐部的活动，受到了深刻的教育。有人说，俱乐部就是一所自我教育的业余学校。不久前，幸福一社有些社员滋长了自满情绪，鼓不起劲，甚至有的抱着：“管你千斤不千斤，伸手就得给工分”，只顾抢工分，不管工作质量好坏。有些社员不爱护社里的公共财产，生产工具哪里用哪里丢，全社五十九头耕牛，就有二十四头喂得瘦弱。也有的社员由于铺张浪费，给生活带来了困难。根据这种情况，这个社的俱乐部在3月份用图画、实物，用好坏典型对比的方法，举办了一个以爱国、爱社、爱节约为内容的展览。这个展览紧紧抓住群众中的典型事例，通过表扬、批评来教育群众，十分生动活泼。例如，展览中有这样一幅图画，画了一位老人正在雨中勤奋地劳动，上面写着：“四队李牛仁，年纪过六旬，起早摸黑赛别人，晴天雨天都出勤”。就在同一幅画上还有一个看来挺年轻的人却坐在家里：“四队李传青，年纪比牛仁轻，别人上工他在屋里云（没事干的意思），光搞菜园不顾社里大跃进”。展览中表扬了许多爱护社公共财产、勤俭持家的社员，对损坏农具、虐待耕牛以及做活不讲质量的社员，进行了批评。这样就使社员受到了一次深刻的教育。许多社员看了以后，主动地检讨了自己的缺点和错误。曾钱喜原是全社出名的“懒婆娘”，去年全年只做了十多个工，最近她像变成了两个人，每天从早到晚手不停脚不住地干，半个多月做的工分就比去年一年还多。
    在小庙乡，俱乐部不只是积极的批评，更多的注意好人好事的表扬，以鼓励群众前进。灯塔六社第七生产队，每天天色微微透明，社员们就爬起来到几里路以外的岳口镇积肥，俱乐部便贴出大字报表扬他们：“七队社员干劲大，风雨路滑都不怕，男女老少齐出发，街上的肥料搬回家，这是队长抓的呱，希望今后发扬它。”这样带动了全社，第二天，全社参加积肥的达到四百多人。全社一鼓作气只花了五天时间就积肥八千多担。
    在小庙乡，俱乐部密切配合中心工作的另一特点是，当中心工作到来的时候，俱乐部除很快地组织力量进行文字的口头的宣传以外，这个时候的文艺演唱的活动也更加活跃。一般地采取农闲集中，农忙分散；雨天集中，晴天分散；晚上集中，白天分散。因此，不论农忙、农闲，俱乐部的活动从不间断。演唱材料绝大部分是农民自己创作的，而在编写这些演唱材料时，一般是“抓生产，抓思想，抓典型”。这样，就使内容更结合实际，收到的效果也就更大些。例如，去年夏天，这里遭到了稀有的干旱，绿色的棉叶一天天的枯萎了，就在这个时候，幸福二社有个叫王培华的青年社员，带头用水浇活了五亩快要枯死的棉花，俱乐部便把这一事迹编成了“棉花抗旱”小调，到处演唱，结果改变了这里历史上从不用水浇棉花的习惯，闹起了热火朝天的抗旱斗争，就这样，当时全社遭受干旱威胁最严重的四十多亩棉花，全部被挽救过来了。为了密切配合生产，推动生产，许多俱乐部做到了“就地取材，做什么，编什么，演什么”。棉花播种时间到了，他们就编唱“棉花播种十要十不要”、“棉花技术快板”等等。开展兴修水利、积肥、学文化、除四害的时候，他们就针对上述不同内容，编唱了许多歌舞剧、大鼓、渔鼓、快板、相声，对推动这些工作起了显著作用。
    由于俱乐部的活动丰富多采，并且做到了经常化，因而在很大程度上活跃了群众的文化生活，改变了农村原来的生活面貌，到处呈现一片欣欣向荣、朝气勃勃的气象。在这里，一般的情况是，队里七天一小演，社里半月一大演，乡里一月一会演。农活繁忙的时候，演员们便分散在各个队里，车水时，就带领社员唱车水歌，打麦时唱打麦歌，插秧时唱插秧歌。这些歌几乎人人会哼，个个能唱。连一些上了年纪的老头和老婆婆，也都跟着年轻人一块愉快地边生产边唱歌。许多小伙子和姑娘们，随时可以把红绿带子往腰里一扎，跳起来，唱起来。到了晚上有时候还在月光下举行歌舞晚会。此外，每当农闲的时候，各种球类活动也搞开了，篮球、乒乓球，都是农民最喜爱的活动。
    俱乐部在普及文化知识、传播生产技术方面，也起了很大作用。目前，全乡建立了业余创作小组十六个，最近两、三个月来，他们已经创作了剧本、民歌、快板、大鼓等五十多篇。同时在剧目排演过程中，通过抄词、对词，许多演员也学习了文化，绝大多数演员开始都是文盲或半文盲，现在都能认识六七百字，最多的能认识一千五百字左右，有的已能开始创作。为了传播生产技术，俱乐部除了通过演唱、黑板报等形式经常传播以外，田间宣传牌的作用也很大。例如，去年棉花抗灾增产运动中，俱乐部把每块田应抓什么措施，都写在宣传牌上。丰岭四社在田间宣传牌上写着：“前期荒苗，后期荒桃，消灭荒草”、“三次培高，行距薅泡，减少蒸发，防旱防涝”，等等。每次换宣传牌时，社员们就说：“又开药单子来了。”
    小庙乡俱乐部从1954年就开始建立了，几年来一直坚持得很好，一年到头，从来没间断过活动。为什么小庙乡俱乐部搞得这样好呢？这主要是由于这个乡的党组织的重视，采取层层加强领导，分工负责的办法，把俱乐部工作认真地抓起来的结果。乡总支副书记和宣传委员负责领导全乡俱乐部工作，俱乐部主任由社的党支书兼任，另外，都派有共青团支部副书记或支委专门领导俱乐部。每个俱乐部都建立了团小组。乡党总支根据生产季节和俱乐部的活动情况，及时地提出要求，指出活动方向，交代活动方法。这是使俱乐部紧紧结合中心工作，为政治、生产服务的关键。
    经验证明，经常地教育俱乐部活动成员，也是巩固俱乐部的重要措施。小庙乡的作法是：开展竞赛，定期评模，奖励先进，每月一小评，每季一大评，每年一总评，这样，俱乐部许多成员既是生产上的劳动能手，又是宣传工作中的模范以及各项中心工作的带头人。为了提高活动质量，这个乡还建立了中心俱乐部，使之形成全乡俱乐部网。中心俱乐部设立业务传授站，定期进行业务知识的传授，还经常举办一些示范性的活动，吸收一般俱乐部来参观。现在，这个乡的党组织正进一步加强对俱乐部的领导，努力提高活动质量，使俱乐部在大跃进的号角声中，也来个大跃进。
