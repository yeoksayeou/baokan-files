Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 16th. The Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province was officially established on April 15th. At the first session of the first People's Congress of the Autonomous Prefecture, two hundred and ninety-two representatives of various ethnic groups from fifteen counties, representing one million six hundred and seventy thousand people of all ethnic groups, elected Pu Guizhong (Yi nationality) as the governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, Geng Zhengguo (Han nationality) and Li Zhong (Yi nationality) as deputy governors, and Yu Zizheng, Long Yin, Zheng Lun and twenty-three others as members of the Prefectural People's Committee, and Li Hongzhi (Yi nationality) as the president of the Intermediate People's Court.

Xie Hechou (Zhuang nationality), a member of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee and Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Chong (Yi nationality), Deputy Governor of Yunnan Province, and representatives from Guangxi and Guizhou, attended the meeting to offer their congratulations.

Geng Zhengguo, the former Commissioner of the Chuxiong Special District, delivered a report at the meeting on the "Achievements of the Past Eight Years and Main Tasks for the Future," proposing that this year's total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations in the Autonomous Prefecture will increase by 61% compared to last year, grain output will increase by 30%, and there will also be significant development in local industry. In their speeches, representatives of various ethnic groups used countless moving examples to prove that the Autonomous Prefecture's leap forward plan is entirely achievable. They said that last year the total grain output of the prefecture increased from more than 900 million jin in 1952 to more than 1.2 billion jin, averaging more than 700 jin per person. This year, in the high tide of water conservancy construction among farmers of all ethnic groups, the water conservancy projects built in the first quarter alone can irrigate more than 600,000 mu of paddy fields, equivalent to twice the total number of water conservancy projects built by generations in the entire district before liberation. The prefecture has already overfulfilled this year's fertilizer accumulation leap forward target, accumulating more than 21 billion jin of fertilizer. The great leap forward in local industry is even more rapid. Workers of all ethnic groups in the original eighty-nine old enterprises have tried every means to increase production. The total output value created in the first three months of this year has jumped to exceed the total output value of local industry in the entire past year. In 1952, there were only seven dilapidated small enterprises in the entire district, which have now developed into 233 various types of factories and mines. Since March, an average of more than three factories and mines in the Autonomous Prefecture have been put into production every day, and more than 140 new factories and mines have been built. Wang Wenyu, Secretary of the CPC Chuxiong Prefectural Committee, also spoke at the meeting. He called on the people of all ethnic groups in the entire Autonomous Prefecture to unite closely under the leadership of the Party, make persistent efforts, and strive to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in the Autonomous Prefecture!

    云南楚雄彝族自治州成立
    据新华社昆明16日电　云南省楚雄彝族自治州4月15日正式成立。在自治州第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上，十五个县的二百九十二名各族人民代表，代表一百六十七万各民族人民，选举普贵忠（彝族）为自治州州长，耿正国（汉族）、李忠（彝族）为副州长，于子正、龙吟、郑伦等二十六人为州人民委员会委员，李洪治（彝族）为中级人民法院院长。
    全国人民代表大会民族委员会委员、中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任谢鹤筹（僮），云南省副省长张冲（彝）和广西、贵州的代表，都到会祝贺。
    前楚雄专区专员耿正国在会上作了“八年来的工作成就和今后主要任务”的报告，提出今年自治州的农副业总产值将比去年增长61％，粮食产量增长30％，地方工业方面也将有很大发展。各民族人民代表们在发言中，以无数动人事例，证明自治州的这个跃进规划完全可以实现。他们说，去年全州粮食总产量由1952年的九亿多斤增长到十二亿多斤，平均每人七百多斤。今年各族农民在兴修水利的高潮中，第一季度兴修的水利就可以增灌六十多万亩水田，相当于全区解放前世世代代兴修水利总数的一倍。全州目前已经超额完成了今年的积肥跃进指标，积肥二百一十多亿斤。地方工业大跃进更是来势迅猛，原有八十九个老企业的各民族工人，想尽一切办法增加生产，今年头三个月创造的总产值，一跃超过了去年全年地方工业总产值的总和。1952年全区只有七个破烂不堪的小企业，现在已发展到二百三十三座各类厂矿。从3月份起，自治州平均每天有三个以上的厂矿投入生产，建成的新厂矿已有一百四十多个。中共楚雄地委书记王文玉在会上也讲了话。他号召全自治州各族人民在党的领导下紧密团结，再接再厉，为实现自治州工农业生产全面大跃进而奋斗！
