Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications

Will Produce Semiconductor Three-Channel Carrier Machine Ahead of Schedule

    In order to implement the policy of combining teaching with production and running socialist universities well, the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications will manufacture many new machines for relevant enterprises on the basis of continuously improving the quality of teaching. It has been decided to complete the first domestically-made semiconductor three-channel carrier machine, originally planned to be completed by the end of the year, ahead of schedule on May 1st. This carrier machine is characterized by low power consumption, small size, and easy maintenance. It can be used for long-distance telephone communication within counties and can also transmit telegrams and send wired broadcasts. It will play a great role in promoting the development of telecommunications within counties. (Song Hao)

    北京邮电学院
    将提前制成半导体三路载波机
    北京邮电学院，为了贯彻教学结合生产，办好社会主义大学的方针，在不断提高教学质量的基础上，将为有关企业制造许多新的机器。决定将原来打算在年底完成第一部国产半导体三路载波机，提前在“五一”节完成。这架载波机的特点是用电少，体积小，维护简便，可用于县内长途电话通信，同时，还可以通电报，送有线广播，对县内电信通信的发展，将起很大的推动作用。　（松浩）
