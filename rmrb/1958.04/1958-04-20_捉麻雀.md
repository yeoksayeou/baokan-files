    Catching Sparrows
    Liu Xiaoting, Poem; Teng Fengqian, Paper Cutting
    Slingshot, small net,
    Carried on the body like a big gun.
    Calm down, stay quiet,
    Aim accurately and fire the gun.
    Slingshot shooting, net trapping,
    Will send sparrows to see the King of Hell.
    Mom is happy to see it,
    Dad praises it a lot.
    Who says children are too young?
    They are really good at eliminating sparrows.

    捉麻雀
    刘小亭 诗　滕凤谦剪纸皮弹弓小线网带在身上当大枪。沉住气，不声响，看准目标把枪放。弹弓打，线网装要叫麻雀见阎王。妈见了好欢喜爹见了很夸奖谁说孩子年纪小，消灭麻雀真在行。
