    Appropriate Timing and Amount: Scientific Water Use
    Shantou Prefecture Promotes Planned Water Use Experience in Anjie Irrigation Area
    (Our Correspondent Huang Yijian reports) Shantou Prefecture, Guangdong Province, is vigorously promoting scientific water use (planned water use). Within this year, 40% of the paddy fields in Shantou Prefecture will implement this advanced system.
    Scientific water use involves irrigation and drainage according to the different growth stages of rice, ensuring that seedlings receive timely and appropriate irrigation and controlling their growth. According to experiments in Chao'an, Jieyang, and Wuhua counties, this irrigation method has many benefits: it can save water, save labor, expand irrigation area, improve drought resistance, improve irrigation efficiency, and increase yield per unit area. Local farmers strongly support this scientific irrigation method.
    The first step in implementing scientific water use is to estimate water sources and develop water use plans for half a year, one season, or one month. The second step is to develop irrigation systems based on the water requirements of rice at each stage. After that, scientific water use can be arranged. However, this arrangement must be combined with local conditions.
    The Anjie Irrigation Area (a joint irrigation area of Chao'an and Jieyang counties) began to pilot scientific water use in the late rice crop of 1956. Over the past three years, agricultural production in this irrigation area has greatly developed. In 1956, the average rice yield per mu reached 1,138 jin, and in 1957 it reached 1,153 jin. Last year, the Anjie Irrigation Area Management Office conducted a special survey in Fuyang Township, Chao'an County. Gaochao Cooperative in Fuyang Township has ten production teams, six of which are in the scientific water use area and the other four in the non-planned water use area. In the late rice crop planted in 1957, the six teams in the planned water use area had an average rice yield per mu that was 39 jin higher than the four teams in the non-planned water use area. At the same time, Longmei Cooperative in Fuyang Township also specifically selected two production teams with basically the same soil quality, fertilization, and farming techniques for testing. The results showed that the production team in the scientific water use area produced 19 jin more rice per mu than the production team in the non-scientific water use area.
    Implementing scientific water use can also save a large amount of water. In the early rice crop of 1957, the Anjie Irrigation Area Management Office conducted comparative tests on two branch canals. The amount of water used per mu in the scientific water use area was 65 cubic meters less than that in the non-scientific water use area, saving one-third of the water. Due to the reduced water consumption, the area expanded the irrigation area by 31,000 mu in 1958.
    The work of implementing rational irrigation and drainage and scientific water use is relatively detailed and strict, and it may seem to require more manpower. In fact, according to the measures taken by the Chaohua-Xiafu Joint Irrigation Area in Wuhua County, a large amount of manpower can be saved. They divided the entire irrigation area into 32 management responsibility areas, each equipped with a water manager in charge of management. This saved 119 laborers compared to the past, when each of the 151 contracted output groups in the area was equipped with a water manager.

    适时适量　科学用水
    汕头专区推广安揭灌区计划用水经验
    本报讯　记者黄毅坚报道：广东省汕头专区大力推广科学用水
  （计划用水）。汕头专区今年内将有40％的稻田实行这个先进的制度。
    科学用水是根据水稻不同的发育阶段进行排灌，能够保证禾苗得到适时适量的灌溉，并且可以控制禾苗的生长。根据潮安、揭阳、五华等县几个点的试验，这种灌溉方法好处很多，可以节约水量，节省人工，扩大灌溉面积，提高抗旱能力，提高灌溉效率，提高单位面积产量。当地农民对这种科学的灌溉方法非常拥护。
    实施科学用水首先是估计水源，作出半年、一季或一个月的用水计划。其次是按照各阶段水稻需水要求，制定灌溉制度。之后，就可以安排科学用水。但这个安排必须结合当地实际情况。
    安揭灌区（潮安、揭阳两县联合灌溉区）在1956年晚造开始试行科学用水，三年来这个灌区的农业生产有很大发展，1956年水稻产量平均每亩达一千一百三十八斤，1957年达一千一百五十三斤。安揭灌区管理处，去年专门在潮安县浮洋乡作了调查。浮洋乡高潮社共有十个生产队，六个队是在科学用水区的，另外四个队在非计划用水区。1957年种的晚造，计划用水区的六个队比非计划用水区的四个队，水稻产量平均每亩高三十九斤；与此同时，浮洋乡陇美社，还特别选择了土质、施肥、耕作技术等条件基本相同的两个生产队作试验，结果科学用水区的生产队比非科学用水区的生产队每亩多产稻谷十九斤。
    施行科学用水还可以大量节约水量，安揭灌区管理处1957年早造曾在两条支渠上测验对比，科学用水地区每亩用水量比非科学用水区少六十五公方，节约用水三分之一，由于用水减少，该区1958年再扩大灌溉面积三万一千亩。
    实行合理排灌科学用水的工作比较细致严格，看起来好像要增加人力，其实按照五华县超华、夏阜联合灌区所采取的措施，还可以节省大批人力，他们把整个灌区划分为三十二个管理责任区，每区配一个管水员专职管理，这样比过去全区一百五十一个包产组每组配一个管水员节省出一百一十九人的劳动力。
