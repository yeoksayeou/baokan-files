Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 5th - Materials recently published here indicate that Albania's light industrial output last year increased to twenty-four and a half times that of pre-liberation 1938.

During the years of the people's regime, Albania has built a number of light industrial enterprises. In order to meet the needs of the working people for consumer goods, light industry will supply 23% more goods this year than last year. The variety of products will also increase. The methods to achieve these goals are to make better use of existing equipment capacity and to put newly built enterprises into production as soon as possible. For example, a hosiery factory that began construction in Korçë last year will be put into production in the first half of this year. Soon, the reconstruction project of a shoe factory in Tirana will also be completed. This factory's output this year will increase by 10.8%.

    阿轻工业长足发展
    产量为1938年的二十四倍
    新华社地拉那5日电　这里不久前公布的材料表明，阿尔巴尼亚去年的轻工业产量增加到了解放前1938年的二十四倍半。
    在人民政权年代中，阿尔巴尼亚已经建设了若干轻工业企业。为了满足劳动人民对消费品的需要，今年轻工业还将比去年多供应23％的货物。产品种类也将增加。达到这些目标的方法是更好地利用现有的设备能力和使新建的企业早日投入生产。例如，去年在科尔察开始建设的一个制袜厂，今年上半年将可以投入生产。不久，地拉那一家制鞋厂的改建工程也将要完工。这家工厂今年的产量将增加10.8％。
