    A Magnificent Annihilation War
    — A Record of the Capital's People Completely Encircing and Suppressing Sparrows
    By Our Reporter An Zhonghuang
    In the history of the capital's "Eliminate Four Pests, Emphasize Hygiene" movement, there will be an extraordinary record: this year, on April 19, 20, and 21, a battle of unprecedented scale in Beijing to completely encircle and suppress sparrows was conducted. In this battle, the people of the capital united as one, were brave and resourceful, and achieved brilliant results. 450,000 sparrows lost their lives under the combined general attack of bombing, poisoning, beating, and nest-emptying tactics. Now, sparrows are rarely seen in many areas.

      Attack their Weaknesses
    This was an unusual battle. The "enemy" people wanted to eliminate was the pest bird that ravaged grain – the sparrow. Its weaknesses are its short wings, which prevent it from flying far or high, and it cannot fly for too long without needing to rest; it has a large stomach and gets hungry easily, starving to death if it goes a day without food; it is very afraid of loud noises and dares not approach bright colors. Gu De, the Deputy General Commander of the Beijing Sparrow Eradication Campaign, gave an interesting explanation of the habits of sparrows. He said that every day at dawn, sparrows leave their nests and gather together for a while to discuss where to find food, and then set off. After the sparrow has eaten its fill, it goes to the riverbank or tree branches to drink some water, rest, sing, and discuss where to play. In the afternoon, from four or five o'clock until dusk, the sparrows look for food again, and then return to their nests. Based on these weaknesses and habits of sparrows, the Beijing Sparrow Eradication Headquarters determined the steps and timing of the operation: bomb, drive away, poison, and beat them from 5:00 AM to 8:30 AM and from 4:00 PM to 7:30 PM; search, capture, and block nests from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM and from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM.

          Three Million Warriors with One Heart
    At 4:30 AM on the 19th, the Sparrow Eradication Headquarters issued a battle order to the city to begin the campaign to encircle and suppress sparrows. An army of more than three million people immediately launched a major offensive against the sparrows. For three days, everyone in the city was assigned a post, defenses were built everywhere, and sentries were stationed step by step, creating an inescapable net for the sparrows. Men, women, old, and young started knocking on various instruments and waving colorful flags from 5:00 AM, and the deafening sound of knocking and shouting came from all directions. Scarecrows and dummies on trees and roofs swayed in the wind. The sparrows, just out of their nests, had not expected this and were frightened out of their wits, trying to escape everywhere, but there was nowhere to land. Large numbers of sparrows could not withstand about three hours of continuous bombing and driving and finally fell to the ground, exhausted and hungry, to be annihilated. Some sparrows found "lands of peace and happiness" – poison bait areas and firearm annihilation areas. There, no one was driving them away, and there was food to eat. But in an instant, after eating poison bait soaked in "nitric acid strychnine" solution, they were poisoned to death or shot dead by firearms. In the evening, people tracked down the sparrows that had luckily escaped, and those hiding in the eaves, trees, and haystacks were captured. Command headquarters at all levels also mobilized many soldiers and students to support the sparrow eradication campaign in parks where sparrows were likely to hide but manpower was weak. On the third day of the battle, the sparrows were driven even more exhausted and weak, and eager to rest and eat. Various districts appropriately increased the number of poison bait areas, poisoning a large number of sparrows and expanding the victory. Throughout the battle, the combined tactics of bombing, poisoning, beating, and nest-emptying exerted great power. The mass bombing and driving of sparrows was very effective. It is estimated that about one-third of the sparrows eliminated in the city died from exhaustion due to being driven. The driving also forced the sparrows to enter the poison bait areas and firearm annihilation areas, creating favorable conditions for poisoning, beating, and nest-emptying. Suburban residents found many sparrows that had died of exhaustion in their nests when they emptied them at night.

      Effort Plus Wisdom, Cunning Sparrows Cannot Escape
    For these three days, the people of the capital were always high-spirited and grew stronger as they fought. Boundless effort and diligence were fully demonstrated in this battle. According to the headquarters' regulations, bombing and driving were to start at 5:00 AM every morning, but many people got up as early as 4:00 AM or even 3:00 AM to prepare or start knocking on instruments. An 80-year-old woman named Sun, who lived in Zhao Zhui Zi Hutong, knocked on a brass basin all day on the 20th. The next day, she got up very early and joined the battle again before 5:00 AM. A woman named Zhang Bingjie in Chongwen District saw a "blank spot" near Dongsi Kuaiyu and took the initiative to find more than ten women to guard this position. Sparrows landing on tall buildings were perhaps the most troublesome, but many clever people were able to drive them down or prevent them from landing. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, responsible for bombing and driving sparrows on the Drum Tower in Dongsi District, hung many large balloons with colored silk attached to the railings to intimidate the sparrows, and the sparrows dared not approach. In a poison bait area in Taoranting Park, students from Beijing No. 58, 62, and 63 Middle Schools controlled the area as a zone where "sparrows are only allowed to enter, not allowed to leave." They ambushed around the poison bait area, watching the exhausted sparrows being driven into the poison bait area, but when a sparrow tried to fly away, they came out to drive the sparrow back in. In this way, 271 sparrows were poisoned to death on the 20th alone. The members of the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative changed their tactics according to the situation and eliminated more sparrows. They set up poison bait areas in rice paddies and other places where sparrows were active. On the first day, they put the poison bait in separate piles, which only poisoned 45 sparrows. The next day, they scattered the poison bait and sprinkled a layer of chaff on top to camouflage it, and sure enough, the sparrows were easily caught, poisoning 108 sparrows in two hours. The cunning "old home thieves" could not escape from the people's hands.

            Men, Women, Old, and Young Mobilized
    This battle was truly a nationwide mobilization, with everyone working together with one heart. Every day, trams and buses departing early in the morning transported people to the sparrow eradication front. More than three million workers, farmers, cadres, students, soldiers, and residents became warriors in the sparrow eradication campaign for these three days. Some organizations, except for a portion of staff left on duty, all joined the battle ranks. Many leading Party and government cadres from the central government and Beijing participated in the sparrow eradication activities. Workers who had just finished their night shifts immediately picked up "weapons" to bomb and drive away sparrows. The sharpshooters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing played an active role in this battle. Many soldiers went to areas with dense sparrow populations and fought alongside the local people. Young people and street residents were active warriors in the sparrow eradication campaign. Xu Yixuan, who lived in Qianmen District, mobilized his entire family of three generations, seven people in all. The 72-year-old Xu Yixuan held a colorful flag and bombed and drove away sparrows on the street, his wife served as the street sparrow catching team leader, his daughter-in-law went up on the roof, and his grandson and granddaughter knocked on copper tea trays and broken washbasins. The people of the whole city had a common will – to eliminate the "Four Pests" in the capital as soon as possible. Therefore, they coordinated and acted consistently throughout the campaign, making this battle a great victory.
    The number of people participating in the sparrow eradication campaign was so large, the area so wide, and the results so great, which is inseparable from the extensive publicity and mobilization conducted by the Beijing Sparrow Eradication Headquarters before and after the sparrow eradication campaign. Many streets launched debates on the theme of eliminating the Four Pests, and various districts convened mass film conferences to publicize the harm of sparrows and the knowledge of sparrow eradication. Some people held erroneous views such as "In a year of good harvest, there is no need to fear the sparrows," but this was refuted by persuasive mass language such as "Sparrows in the tens of thousands, rising and falling on the stones." Slogans such as "Bomb, Beat, Poison, Empty Nests, Make Sparrows Extinct" could be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys. Many street and alley blackboards were also changed to content on sparrow eradication. Many residents watched the film introducing the sparrow eradication situation in Hedeng Township, Xinfan County, Sichuan. During the battle, propaganda vehicles carrying dead sparrows drove through the streets, and people saw the sparrows they had personally eliminated, which further strengthened their fighting will.

          This Battle Was Prepared Early
    Before the start of the sparrow eradication campaign, the people of the capital carried out meticulous organization and preparation work. At the end of March, the Beijing Patriotic Health Movement Committee visiting group went to Sichuan to study the sparrow eradication experience in Wenjiang Prefecture. Based on this experience, a pilot project was conducted in Huangtugang Township, Fengtai District, Beijing suburbs in early April, where more than 3,000 sparrows were eliminated in three days. The Sparrow Eradication Headquarters, which commanded the city's battle, was established on the 14th, and the city was divided into large and small war zones. The General Headquarters commanded the battle through Beijing People's Broadcasting Station. Beijing People's Broadcasting Station exceptionally started broadcasting at 4:30 in the morning, and also reported the results of the battle and introduced battle experience in a timely manner. Command headquarters were also established in various districts and townships, and command teams were established in street offices and towns. Resident committees established shock brigades, and agricultural cooperatives also established shock brigades according to production organization. Some areas also organized mobile teams, bombing teams, slingshot teams, sound teams, and search teams, according to the situation of manpower. Command organizations at all levels promptly grasped the overall situation in their respective areas, formulated combat plans, organized manpower and materials, and commanded operations. The relevant departments prepared a large number of poison baits, firecrackers, bamboo poles and other "weapons." Every household collected various instruments that could make sounds. People also carefully made many dummies. On the day before the start of the battle, these dummies had already "gone" to the battle positions in advance. On the 18th, bombing, poisoning, beating, and nest-emptying exercises were conducted in the urban and suburban districts.
    This is a heroic and great action. It proves once again that under the leadership of the Party, the power of the masses is incomparably strong, and therefore, such a moving miracle has been created in a short period of time.

    一场轰轰烈烈的歼灭战
    ——首都人民全面围剿麻雀记
    本报记者　安仲皇
    在首都“除四害、讲卫生”的运动史中将有一段不平常的记载：今年4月19、20、21三天进行了一场北京史无前例的全面围剿麻雀的战役。首都人民在这场战役中，同心合力，有勇有谋，战果辉煌。四十五万只麻雀在人们轰、毒、打、掏综合战术的总攻下丧了命。现在许多地区已经看不到麻雀了。
      攻其弱点
    这是一场不寻常的战斗。人们要消灭的“敌人”是糟踏粮食的害鸟——麻雀。它的弱点是翅膀短小，飞不远也飞不高，飞的时间不能太长，要飞飞歇歇；它的肚子大，容易饿，只要一昼夜吃不到东西就会饿死；它很怕响声，也不敢靠近鲜艳的颜色。北京市围剿麻雀副总指挥顾德对麻雀的习性曾作过这样一段有趣的说明。他说，每天天刚亮，麻雀就出窝在一起聚会一会儿，商量到哪里去吃食，然后出发。麻雀吃饱了，它就到河边、树枝上喝点水，休息休息，唱唱歌，互相商量一下到什么地方去玩耍。下午四、五点钟到天黑前，麻雀又要觅食，然后就回窝。根据麻雀的这些弱点和习性，北京市围剿麻雀总指挥部确定了作战的步骤和时间：清晨五时到八时半和下午四时到七时半进行轰赶毒打，上午八时到下午四时和晚八时到十时搜捕、掏堵。
          三百万勇士一条心
    19日清晨四时半，围剿麻雀总指挥部向全市人民发出了围剿麻雀开始的战斗命令。三百多万人组成的剿雀大军立刻向麻雀大举进攻。三天中，全城人人对号，处处建防，步步设岗，为麻雀布下了天罗地网。男女老少从清晨五时开始敲起了各种响器，摇起彩旗?喊，从四面八方传出了震耳的敲打响器的声音和?喊声。树上、房上的草人、假人也随风飘动。刚一出窝的麻雀可没料到这一着，顿时吓得破了胆似的，到处逃命，但是哪里也落不了脚。大量的麻雀经不起三个小时左右的连续轰赶，终于累饿交加，纷纷落地就歼。有的麻雀找到了“安乐乡”——毒饵区、火枪歼灭区。这里既无人轰赶，还有食吃。但在刹那间，吃了“硝酸士的年”液浸过的毒饵后，一个个中毒丧命，或被火枪击毙。晚间，人们跟踪追击侥幸漏网的麻雀，躲在房檐、树上、草垛的麻雀纷纷被擒。各级指挥部还调动了许多战士和学生到容易隐藏麻雀而人力薄弱的公园去支援围剿麻雀。战斗的第三天，麻雀被轰赶得更加疲惫无力，急于休息、吃食。各区又适当增加了毒饵区，毒死了大量麻雀，扩大了战果。在整个战斗中，轰、毒、打、掏的综合战术发挥了极大的威力。群众性的大轰大赶麻雀的效果很显著，据估计，全市消灭的麻雀中约有三分之一是由于轰赶累死的。轰赶也迫使麻雀不得不进入毒饵区和火枪歼灭区，为毒、打、掏创造了有利的条件。郊区居民在晚间掏窝时就掏到了许多累死在窝里的麻雀。
      干劲加智慧，狡雀难逃
    这三天，首都人民始终斗志昂扬，越战越强。无比的干劲和钻劲，在这场战斗中充分显示出来。按照指挥部的规定，每天早上从五时开始轰赶，但是许多人在四点钟甚至三点钟就起床准备或开始敲打响器。住在赵锥子胡同的八十多岁的孙老太太在20日敲了一天铜盆，第二天很早就起床，不到五点钟，又投入了战斗。崇文区一位叫张冰洁的妇女看到东四块玉一带有一块“空白点”，她就主动去找了十多个妇女守住这块阵地。落在高建筑物上的麻雀也许是最使人头痛的事，但是许多聪明人也能把它轰下来或使麻雀不敢落脚。负责在东四区鼓楼上轰赶麻雀的解放军驻京部队把许多大汽球挂上彩绸，拴在栏杆上威吓麻雀，麻雀果然不敢靠前。在陶然亭公园的一块毒饵区，北京市第五十八、六十二、六十三中学的学生把这里控制成了一个“只准麻雀进，不准麻雀出”的地带。他们埋伏在毒饵区的四周，注视着被轰赶得疲惫不堪的麻雀飞进了毒饵区，但是当有一只麻雀要飞离毒饵区时，他们就出来把麻雀轰进去。这样在20日一天就毒死了二百七十一只麻雀。红旗农业社的社员们相机改变策略，消灭了更多的麻雀。他们在麻雀经常活动的稻田等处设置了毒饵区。头一天把毒饵分开一堆堆地放，只毒死了四十五只麻雀。第二天他们把毒饵分散着放，上面还撒上一层糠伪装起来，果然麻雀容易上钩，在两小时内就毒死一百零八只。狡猾的“老家贼”就这样怎么也逃不出人们的手掌。
            男女老少齐出动
    这一场战斗真是全民动员，同心合力。每天，提前出场的电车和公共汽车把人们送到了灭雀战线。三百多万工人、农民、干部、学生、战士和居民在这三天中成了剿雀的勇士。有的机关除留下一部分值班的人员外，全部编入了战斗队伍。中央和北京市的许多党政负责干部都参加了剿雀活动。刚下了夜班的工人也立刻拿起“武器”轰赶麻雀。解放军驻京部队的神枪手在这次战役中发挥了积极作用。许多战士到麻雀密集的地区和当地人民并肩作战。青少年、街道居民都是剿雀的积极战士。住在前门区的徐益轩全家老少三辈七口人，全体出动。七十二岁的徐益轩拿着彩旗在大街上轰赶麻雀，他的老伴当了街道捕雀队长，儿媳妇上了房，孙子和孙女敲铜茶盘和破脸盆。全市人民有一个共同的意志——早日除尽首都的“四害”。因此在整个战役中协同作战，一致行动，使这次战斗取得了巨大胜利。
    参加剿雀的人数这样多，面这样广，战果这样大，是和北京市围剿麻雀总指挥部在围剿麻雀前后进行了广泛的宣传动员分不开的。许多街道以除四害为题展开了辩论，各区都召开了群众片会宣传了麻雀的害处和围剿麻雀的常识。一部分人中间存在着“丰收之年、不怕雀弹”等错误论调，但被“麻雀成万、一起一落上石”等具有说服力的群众语言驳倒了。街头巷尾，到处可以看到“轰、打、毒、掏，使麻雀断子绝孙”等标语口号。许多街巷的黑板报也换成了围剿麻雀的内容。许多居民观看了介绍四川新繁县禾登乡围剿麻雀情况的电影。在战斗期间载着死麻雀的广播宣传车行驶在街头，人们看到他们亲手消灭的麻雀更加增强了战斗意志。
          这场战斗早有准备
    在围剿麻雀的战斗开始以前，首都人民进行了周密的组织和准备工作。北京市爱国卫生运动委员会参观组在3月底到四川学习了温江专区围剿麻雀的经验。根据这个经验，4月上旬在京郊丰台区黄土岗乡进行了试点，在那里三天共消灭了三千多只麻雀。指挥全市战斗的围剿麻雀总指挥部在14日成立，全市划分了大大小小的战区。总指挥部通过北京人民广播电台指挥作战。北京人民广播电台破例从清晨四时半开始播音，还及时报告战果，介绍战斗经验。各区、乡也成立了指挥部，街道办事处和镇成立了指挥组。居民委员会成立了突击队，农业社也按生产组织成立了突击队。有些地区还根据人力情况，分别组织了机动队、轰赶队、弹弓队、音响队、搜捕队。各级指挥组织都及时掌握本地区的全面情况，拟定作战计划，组织人力、物资，指挥作战。有关部门准备了大批毒饵、爆竹、竹竿等“武器”。家家户户收集了各种能敲打出声的响器人们还精心制作了许多假人。在战斗开始的前一天，这些假人就预先“走”上了战斗岗位。18日，城郊各区都进行了轰、毒、打、掏的演习。
    这是一桩豪迈伟大的行动。它再一次证明：在党的领导下，群众的力量无比强大，因此在短时期内，就创造出了这样动人的奇迹。
