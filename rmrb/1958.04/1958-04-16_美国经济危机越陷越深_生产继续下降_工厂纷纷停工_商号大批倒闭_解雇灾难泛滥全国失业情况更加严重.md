Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 15th: The Federal Reserve Board announced on the 14th that US industrial production in March fell further than in February.

According to this official report released by the Federal Reserve Board, the US industrial production index for March was 128 (with the 1947-1949 average as 100), a decrease of two points from the February index of 130. This marks the seventh consecutive month of continuous decline in the industrial production index since August 1957. Compared with the March 1957 index of 145, it has decreased by a total of 17 points in the past year, meaning that industrial production has decreased by more than 11.7%. Compared with the peak industrial production index of 147 in December 1946, it has decreased by a total of 19 points, meaning that industrial production has decreased by more than 12.9%.

The report also indicates that in March, both durable goods industries and non-durable goods industries continued to decline, and mineral production decreased significantly.

The Reserve Board also pointed out that in early April, the output of steel, non-ferrous metals, building materials, and automobile assembly all continued to decline.

The Reserve Board's report also pointed out in its summary of business conditions that compared with February, in March, not only did industrial production decrease, but also employment, income, and retail sales decreased, while unemployment increased.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 15th: According to a report in the April 18th issue (published in advance) of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, an average of 45 to 50 businesses are closing down every day in the current US economic crisis, creating the highest business failure rate in the past twenty years.

This year, the US business failure rate has increased by 12% compared to last year and by 27% compared to the year before last.

The magazine wrote: If the current failure rate continues until the end of the year, more than 14,000 businesses will fail in the United States this year.

The magazine pointed out that a large number of closures can be seen in almost all parts of the country, and in businesses of all sizes.

The retail sector has seen the largest increase in the number of closures. The current closure rate of retail stores is more than 13% higher than a year ago. Businesses dealing in automobiles, household equipment, furniture, clothing, and restaurants are failing in large numbers.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 15th: In recent days, a large number of reports about factory shutdowns, layoffs, and unemployment have continued to come from various regions of the United States.

United Press International reported on the 14th that "twenty-four automobile factories across the country are currently shut down for the entire week, causing at least 60,000 workers to be without work." The above figures do not include those automobile factories that, although not completely shut down, have a large number of workers without work or being laid off. For example, in the Buffalo area of ​​New York State, six automobile factories further announced work reductions this week. Among them, 1,150 of the 3,000 workers at a Ford factory have no work to do this week, and another 100 workers have been laid off. In a Chevrolet automobile factory, about 4,000 of the 5,000 workers have no work to do this week.

According to a report in the "Wall Street Journal" on the 10th, in the Detroit area, the center of the automobile industry with the most severe unemployment, the number of unemployed people has already accounted for 17.5% of the total labor force in this area. Some time ago, the number of unemployed people in this area accounted for 15% of the total labor force.

According to an Associated Press report on the 13th, in Kentucky, "the number of unemployed people has reached an unprecedented peak," and "another wave of layoffs in the manufacturing sector in the first two weeks of April has greatly worsened the already serious situation." Those laying off workers include electrical equipment factories, shoe factories, etc. According to officials in the state responsible for unemployment relief, the number of unemployed people in the state reached the highest peak since 1939 last weekend, with more than 126,000 workers unemployed out of 1.2 million workers.

Reuters reported on the 11th that "the phenomenon of laying off workers has been widely spreading in the tire industry and the metal production industry." Major rubber companies are laying off workers in large numbers. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company laid off workers in large numbers at its factory in Ohio last week. Since the beginning of this year, this factory alone has laid off more than 1,400 workers. Firestone Tire & Rubber Company has laid off 1,000 workers in the past six months. Goodrich Rubber Company laid off 700 workers.

    储备局的报告在综述工商业状况时还指出，同2月份相比较，3月份不仅工业生产量降低，而且就业人数、收入和零售额也降低了，而失业人数却增加了。
    新华社15日讯　纽约消息：据“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志4月18日的一期（提前出版）报道，在美国目前的经济危机中，平均每天有四十五到五十家商号倒闭，创造了二十年来商号倒闭率的最高纪录。

    这家杂志写道：如果目前的倒闭率继续到年底，今年美国将有一万四千家以上商号倒闭。
