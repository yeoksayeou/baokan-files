Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 18th: Damascus held celebrations on the 17th to mark the twelfth anniversary of the National Day of the Syrian Region of the United Arab Republic. A grand military parade and mass procession were held on the morning of that day. The Lebanese Army also sent a delegation to participate in the military parade.

Former Syrian President Kuwatly delivered a speech at the celebration ceremony. He said, "As long as imperialism exists, as long as our Arab sister countries have not gotten rid of the shackles of imperialism, we must continue to struggle."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 17th: President Nasser delivered a radio address to the Arab people in Cairo on the 17th to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of the National Day of the Syrian Region of the Arab United Republic. He said that the aspirations of the Arab people could only be realized after they had gotten rid of all the chains that bound them, whether these chains were made of gold or iron.

Nasser said that the struggle of the Arabs proved that Arab problems could only be resolved in the capitals of the Arab countries themselves. He also said that the strength of a country was not determined by the size of its territory or the size of its population, but by the confidence of its people in their rights and the degree to which they conducted their struggle.

    据新华社大马士革18日电　大马士革在17日举行阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区十二周年国庆日的庆祝活动。当天上午举行了盛大的阅兵式和群众游行。黎巴嫩陆军也派遣代表团参加了阅兵式。
    前叙利亚总统库阿特利在庆祝仪式上致词。他说：“只要帝国主义还存在，只要我们的阿拉伯姊妹国还没有摆脱帝国主义的枷锁，我们就要继续进行斗争。”
    据新华社开罗17日电　纳赛尔总统17日在开罗为庆祝阿拉伯联合共和国叙利亚地区十二周年国庆日对阿拉伯人民发表了广播演说。他说，阿拉伯人民的愿望只有在摆脱了束缚他们的一切锁链以后才能实现，不管这种锁链是金的还是铁的。
    纳赛尔说，阿拉伯人的斗争证明，阿拉伯问题只有在阿拉伯各国自己的首都才能得到解决。他还说，一个国家的力量不决定于它的领土大小或人口多少，而决定于它的人民对自己权利的信心和他们斗争进行的程度。
