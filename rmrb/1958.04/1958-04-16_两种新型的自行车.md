    Two New Types of Bicycles
    The state-owned Tianjin Bicycle Factory has successfully trial-produced three "Flying Pigeon" light bicycles of different styles. These three sample bicycles were made by integrating the advantages of three bicycles, namely the British "Raleigh," "BSA," and the Japanese "Fuji." The bike is equipped with a generator light, a pump, a leather bag, and a transparent plastic chain guard. The total weight of the bike is only twenty kilograms. After testing, the quality is good and comparable to the "Raleigh" bicycle. The factory plans to formally produce them in small batches in the second quarter.

    According to the characteristics of rural transportation, the factory has also produced a heavy-duty bicycle that can carry 100 kilograms of goods and is sturdy, durable, and easy to ride. It is expected to meet the market and consumers in the third quarter.

    两种新型的自行车
    国营天津自行车厂试制成功了三辆不同式样的“飞鸽”轻型自行车。这三辆样品车是综合了英国的“凤头”和“三枪”及日本“富士”等三种自行车的优点制成的。车上带有磨电灯、打气筒、皮包和透明塑料制的链子罩，全车重量只有二十公斤。经过试验，质量良好，可以同“凤头”车相媲美。车厂准备在第二季度正式小批生产。
    这个厂还根据农村交通运输的特点，生产一种加重自行车，可驮货一百公斤，而且坚固耐用、乘骑轻快。预计在第三季度在市场与消费者见面。
