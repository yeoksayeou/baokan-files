    Frequent Inspection
    Tian Lianqian
    Currently, many regions have organized inspection teams to conduct in-depth spring plowing inspections in counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives. During the inspection, cadres sent from above are combined with local cadres and experienced farmers, making the work very thorough and specific. Therefore, problems can be discovered and solved in a timely manner, and the enthusiasm of the masses is further encouraged, truly playing a role in promoting production. This type of inspection is worth greatly promoting.
    After the winter production and construction upsurge, this year's production conditions have undergone great changes, providing extremely favorable conditions for striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture. But anyone who thinks that with these conditions, they can sit back and relax, completely without worry, is wrong. The achievements in water conservancy construction this year are great, which everyone admits. However, many newly built ponds have not yet stored water well; some have water, but there are insufficient water lifting tools, or the land is uneven, so the benefits cannot be fully realized. Expanding the planting of high-yield crops is one of the important measures for increasing production in various places, but there is still a large shortage of potato seeds everywhere. In other aspects, there are still many problems to be solved. The prerequisite for solving them is to conduct frequent, in-depth, and meticulous inspections to discover problems in a timely manner.
    After the mass rectification movement since last autumn, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers has been unprecedentedly high, but this does not mean that the old ideas and habits among the masses have been completely eradicated, nor does it mean that everyone's awareness and understanding have reached a very high level. When implementing advanced measures, conservative ideas and the forces of habit will still rise up to resist.浠水Xishui County in Hubei Province inspected the rice seedling fields of three agricultural cooperatives, including the Construction and Red Star cooperatives, and found that neither germination nor transplanting were carried out according to technical specifications. Although the production directors of these three cooperatives had visited the successfully tested "moist seedling fields" before transplanting, they did not seriously implement it after returning to the cooperatives because this method of raising seedlings was different from the past and the masses had many concerns. Without in-depth inspection, such problems are difficult to discover and solve.
    The promotion of new technical measures brings many new problems, which must also be inspected and dealt with in a timely manner. For example, due to the increased number of plants in dense planting of rice, more fertilizer must be applied and applied earlier; the densely planted seedlings will quickly become dense rows, so timely inspection, seedling replacement, and weeding must be carried out. These are all new characteristics, and if they are not discovered through timely inspection and are still handled according to the old procedures, the growth of rice will be affected.
    To ensure the realization of leap forward targets, not only must there be specific and practical tactical measures for each stage from planting to harvesting, but also strategic measures to direct the annual production, that is, to estimate all possible situations and prepare in advance. To be able to attack and defend, and to be able to cope with any changes. After the end of spring sowing, Dingxi Prefecture in Gansu Province inspected and found that some seeds could not germinate due to drought, so they made preparations for contingencies based on the fact that there had been little rain and snow in previous years. They proposed a strategic measure to strictly guard three lines of defense, overcome drought, and strive for increased production. The so-called three lines of defense are: strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops; if summer crops fail, plant autumn crops, strive for a bumper harvest of autumn crops; if major autumn crops fail, plant late autumn crops, if late autumn crops fail, plant vegetables. The main method is to use the greatest determination and strength to effectively manage five million mu of paddy fields, "two yin" fields, and sandy fields, ensuring that these fields have sufficient water and fertilizer, and operate, process, and expand the area of high-yield crops, ensuring that the grain produced is enough for the people of the entire region for a year and a half. Currently, the people of Dingxi are checking the soil moisture and emergence situation plot by plot, and are persisting in fighting on the first line of defense; at the same time, they are collecting seeds for major autumn and late autumn crops, and have prepared the third line of defense. The guiding ideology of this measure is positive and proactive. Prepare from the worst-case scenario, and ensure that there are solutions even in bad situations. If the situation improves, greater victories can be won. With such measures, people can completely grasp the initiative in the fight against natural disasters.
    Inspection can not only discover and solve problems, but also prompt people to look forward and muster the courage to move forward. This year, Suining County in Jiangsu Province has prepared well in terms of water and fertilizer, and the wheat is also growing vigorously. As a result, some people have developed a sense of complacency, believing that this year's preparations were early, the quality was good, and various measures have been done almost enough, so their actions have slowed down. The Suining County Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this situation and immediately organized a group of people to assist the township and cooperative cadres in carrying out inspection and comparison activities. As a result, it was found that more than 100 of the county's 460-plus cooperatives had production increase measures below the target. Later, each township and cooperative held meetings of cadres and member representatives to study remedial measures. Now more than half of the 100-plus cooperatives that were lagging behind in production have caught up with the advanced cooperatives. All of this shows the necessity of "frequent inspection."

    勤检查
    田连阡
    目前很多地区都组织了检查团，分别深入县、区、乡、社进行春耕检查。检查的时候，上边派下去的干部和本地干部以及有经验的农民结合在一起，做得非常深入而具体，因而能够及时发现问题，解决问题，同时也进一步鼓舞了群众的干劲，真正起到了促进生产的作用。这种检查值得大大提倡。
    经过冬季生产建设高潮，今年的生产条件有了很大改变，为争取农业大丰收提供了极其有利的条件。但是谁如果认为有了这些条件就可以高枕无忧，万无一失，那他就错了。今年各地水利建设的成绩很大，这是谁都承认的。但是，许多新修的塘里还没有蓄好水；有的虽然有水，但提水工具不足，或者是土地不平整，仍然不能充分发挥效益。扩种高产作物是各地重要增产措施之一，但马铃薯种子各地还缺很多。其他方面，也还有不少问题需要解决。解决的前提，就是要经常进行深入细致的检查，及时发现问题。
    经过去秋以来的全民整风运动，广大农民的社会主义积极性空前高涨，但这并不等于群众中的旧思想旧习惯已经全部革除，也不是每个人的觉悟和认识都已经很高。在贯彻执行先进措施的时候，保守思想和习惯势力还会起来抵制。湖北浠水县检查了建设、红星等三个农业社的秧田，发现催芽下秧都没有按照技术规格去做。这三个社的生产主任在下秧前虽然都参观过试验成功的
  “润湿秧田”，但由于这种育秧办法和过去不同，群众顾虑很多，他们回社后都没有认真执行。不做深入的检查，这样的问题就很难发现和解决。
    新的技术措施的推行，带来很多新的问题，也必须及时检查处理。比如水稻密植由于棵数增多，就必须多施肥，早施肥；密植的秧很快就会密行，必须及时地查苗补苗和中耕除草。这些都是新的特点，如不及时检查发现，仍按老规程办事，就会影响水稻的生长。
    保证跃进指标的实现，不仅从种到收每一阶段都要有具体切实的战术性措施，而且要有指挥全年生产的战略性措施，就是要估计到各种可能发生的情况，预先作好准备。做到进可以攻，退可以守，遇到任何变化都能应付。甘肃省定西专区结束春播后，检查发现有部分种子因天旱不能发芽，他们便根据历年雨雪较少的事实，作了应变的准备。他们提出严守三道防线，战胜干旱，力争增产的战略性的措施。所谓三道防线就是：力争夏季作物丰收；夏不成种秋，力争秋季作物丰收；大秋不成种晚秋，晚秋不成种菜。主要办法是用最大决心和力量，切实搞好五百万亩水田、二阴田和砂田，保证这些田水足、肥足、操作加工和扩大高产作物面积，保证所产粮食够全区人民一年半的口粮。目前定西人民一面逐块地检查地墒和出芽情况，坚持在第一道防线上进行战斗；一面筹集大秋、晚秋作物种籽，准备了第三道防线。这种措施的指导思想是积极的、主动的。从最坏处着手准备，在坏情况出现时也保证有办法。如果情况变好了，就可以争取更大的胜利。有了这样的措施，人们在和自然灾害作斗争中便完全掌握了主动权。
    检查不仅可以发现问题解决问题，而且促使人们向前看，鼓起勇气前进。江苏睢宁县今年水肥准备都较好，麦子长得也很旺，有些人因此便产生了自满情绪，认为今年备耕早、质量好，各项措施也搞得差不多了，因而行动迟缓起来。中共睢宁县委发现了这一情况，马上组织一批力量协助乡社干部开展检查评比运动，结果发现全县四百六十多个社中尚有一百多个社增产措施低于指标。以后各乡社都召开干部和社员代表会议，研究补救办法。现在一百多个生产上落后的社已有半数以上赶上先进社。所有这些，都说明“勤检查”的必要。
