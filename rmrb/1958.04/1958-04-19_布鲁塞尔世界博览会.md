The World's Fair, which opened on the 17th in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, is the largest international exposition in recent decades. Fifty-three countries and many international organizations are participating in the fair, which will last for six months and is expected to attract 30 to 50 million visitors. This exposition is the thirtieth since its inception in London in 1851, and the first since World War II. The last one was held in New York in 1939. According to the regulations of the exposition, the invitations for this exposition were issued by the host country, Belgium, through diplomatic channels. In addition to capitalist countries, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland accepted the invitation and will showcase their great achievements in various aspects of socialist construction.

The Soviet Pavilion is one of the largest pavilions at this exposition. The pavilion is a rectangular building made of steel, aluminum, and glass, 22 meters high, with an area equivalent to four of Moscow's famous Manege Square. Its ceilings and walls are made of glass. Despite its massive size, it looks light and beautiful, shimmering in the sunlight.

In addition to showcasing its great achievements in industry, agriculture, science, and technology, the Soviet Union will also introduce the Soviet social system and the people's lives to visitors. The exhibits are divided into 18 sections, displayed in 22 large halls. If you see all the exhibits, you will walk about six kilometers.

Every exhibit displayed by the Soviet Union illustrates the achievements of the socialist country over the past forty years. Inside the pavilion, you can first see models of two artificial satellites and the world's largest synchrophasotron. Of course, the atomic icebreaker, the latest "Tu-104" and "Tu-114" aircraft, and the largest hydropower station model can also be seen. The exhibits include many of the latest industrial and agricultural machines, books, paintings, sculptures... In short, from a 40-ton Minsk truck to small precision instruments, from Repin's immortal paintings to exquisite handicrafts, you can see them all. In addition, from the exhibition, you can also get a concise overview of the social structure of the Soviet Union, the Soviet democratic system, the Soviet education system, and the life of the working people.

The pavilion also has a performance hall with 950 seats. In addition to performances by Soviet actors, one hundred various films will be screened, including widescreen and panoramic films.

The Czechoslovak Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair, near the Soviet Pavilion, consists of three cubic buildings connected by glass corridors, with a total area of 13,000 square meters, also among the largest pavilions. The walls on the front of the pavilion are inlaid with amber glass, which seems to radiate thousands of sparks in the sunlight and lamplight. The interior artistic decoration of the pavilion was carefully designed by twenty outstanding artists, and a large number of beautiful decorations themselves are an important part of the exhibition.

The Czechoslovak Pavilion is divided into the "Hall of Labor," the "Hall of Rest," and the "Hall of Culture." Seeing these three pavilions is equivalent to taking a trip to Czechoslovakia.

In the pavilion, you can see powerful machines such as a 120-ton horizontal automatic boring machine and the famous Kaplan turbine, as well as new instruments that use radioactive radiation to test the quality of metal products. Among the exhibits of world-renowned Czechoslovak glassware, there is a glass "Cosmos" illusion, which is an interesting and attractive exhibit.

In the Hall of Rest and the Hall of Culture, you can see the care of socialist Czechoslovakia for the working people and the prosperous socialist culture. The Hall of Culture has performances by outstanding musicians every day and screenings of interesting popular science films.

In late July, Czechoslovakia will also hold its National Day. The Prague National Opera and other theater and dance troupes will perform famous traditional repertoire in Brussels.

    布鲁塞尔世界博览会
    17日在比利时首都布鲁塞尔开幕的世界博览会，是近几十年来最大的一次国际性博览会。参加这次博览会的有五十三个国家和许多国际组织，会期半年，预计参观者将达三千万到五千万人。这种博览会是自1851年在伦敦创立以来的第三十次，是第二次世界大战以后的第一次。上一次是1939年在纽约举行的。按照博览会章程规定，这次博览会的请帖是由主办国家比利时通过外交途径发出的。接受邀请的除资本主义国家外，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和波兰也应邀参加了。它们将展示出社会主义建设各方面的巨大成就。
    苏联展览馆是这次博览会上几个最大的展览馆之一。这个展览馆是用钢、铝和玻璃建成的一座长方形建筑物，高二十二公尺，面积相当于莫斯科有名的练马广场的四个那么大。它的天花板和墙壁都是用玻璃制成的。它的体积虽然庞大，但是看上去却轻巧、漂亮，在阳光下闪闪发光。
    苏联在这次博览会上除展出在工业、农业、科学技术等方面的巨大成就外，还要向参观者介绍苏维埃国家的社会制度和人民生活。展览品共分十八部分展出，分列在二十二个大厅内。如果你看完全部展品，大约要走六公里的路。
    苏联展出的每一件展品都说明社会主义国家四十年的成就。在展览馆内，首先可以看到两个人造卫星和世界上最大的同步稳相加速器的模型。当然，原子破冰船、最新式的“图—104”和“图—114”飞机以及最大的水电站模型，也都可以看到。展品中包括许多最新式的工业和农业机器、书籍、绘画、雕塑……总之，从明斯克出品的载重四十吨的大卡车到小巧的精密仪器，从列宾的不朽名画到精美的手工艺品，都可以看到。此外，从展览中，对苏维埃国家的社会结构、苏维埃民主制度、苏联的教育制度和劳动人民的生活，也都可以得到一个简明概括的了解。
    展览馆内还设有一个有九百五十个座位的演出厅。这儿除苏联演员表演各种节目外，还要上演一百部各种影片，包括宽银幕电影和全景电影。
    捷克斯洛伐克在布鲁塞尔世界博览会上的展览馆，在苏联馆附近，是用玻璃走廊连接起来的三个立方形建筑物，总面积达一万三千平方公尺，也属于最大的展览馆之列。展览馆正面的墙壁上镶嵌着琥珀玻璃，在阳光和灯光照耀下，像是放射出万点火花。展览馆内部的艺术装饰，是由二十位优秀的艺术家精心设计的，大量的优美装饰品本身就是展出的一个重要组成部分。
    捷克斯洛伐克的展览馆分为“劳动馆”、“休息馆”和“文化馆”。看完这三个展览馆就等于到捷克斯洛伐克去游览一次。
    在展览馆可以看到一百二十吨重的卧式自动镗床、著名的卡普兰式涡轮机等强大机器，也可以看到利用放射性辐射检验金属产品质量的新式仪器。在世界闻名的捷克斯洛伐克玻璃制品的展览品中，有一个用玻璃制成的“宇宙”幻景，这是一件有趣而引人的展品。
    在休息馆和文化馆，可以看到社会主义的捷克斯洛伐克对劳动人民的关怀和繁荣的社会主义文化。文化馆每天都有优秀的音乐家表演，并放映有趣的通俗科学影片。
    7月下旬，捷克斯洛伐克还将举办捷克斯洛伐克民族日。布拉格民族歌剧院和其他剧团舞蹈团等，都要在布鲁塞尔演出著名传统剧目。
