    Can't Delay Any Longer
    In the Yellow River diversion project to irrigate the Wei River, the Henan Provincial Department of Transportation undertook the entire bridge construction project. The entire main canal is scheduled to release water on May 1st. If the bridges cannot be completed in time, it will affect transportation in more than a dozen cities and counties, including Xinxiang. After accepting this task, the Department of Transportation sought assistance everywhere. However, when the three bridge engineering teams from the Ministry of Transportation and the foundation piling engineering team from the Ministry of Construction Engineering arrived at the construction site in March to provide support, the Department of Transportation didn't even know the specific requirements for the construction or where to build. The comrades who came to support repeatedly urged the Department of Transportation to expedite the construction arrangements, but the problem has not been resolved to this day. The result of such delays is estimated to be a loss of more than 80,000 yuan just in terms of idle labor and machinery. Now, the water release date of May 1st is very close. If the foundation of the bridge cannot be built above the water surface before the water is released, underwater piling will have to be used, which will increase the investment.
    Why has the construction period been delayed repeatedly like this? According to our understanding: First, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Water Resources are arguing over funding issues, which makes it impossible to determine the construction plan; second, the Department of Transportation and the local authorities have inconsistent requirements for bridge standards and locations; and third, there is a shortage of transportation capacity. We want to ask the Henan Provincial Department of Transportation, when will these problems be resolved?

    再不能拖下去了
    在引黄济卫扩建工程中，河南省交通厅承接了全部桥梁建设工程。整个干渠决定“五一”节放水，如果不能及时修好桥梁，就会影响新乡等十多个县市的交通运输。交通厅接受这项任务后，就四处求援。但是，当3月间交通部的三个桥梁工程队和建筑工程部的基础打桩工程队来工地支援的时候，谁知道交通厅连施工中有些什么具体要求、在那个地方施工都不知道。去支援的同志一次次催交通厅抓紧安排施工，可是，直到现在问题还没有解决。这样拖延的结果，估计只人工和机具停置的损失就有八万多元。现在离“五一”节放水日期很近，如果在放水以前桥的基础部分不能修出水面，要采用水上打桩，那末投资就会加大。
    为什么这样一再拖延施工期呢？据我们了解：一是交通厅和水利厅因为经费问题扯皮，使施工方案不能确定；二是交通厅和地方上对桥梁标准和位置的要求不统一；三是运输力量不足。我们要问问河南省交通厅，这些问题要拖到什么时候才能解决呢？
