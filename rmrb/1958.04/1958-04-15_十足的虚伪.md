    Utter Hypocrisy
    Recently, Adenauer has "repeatedly" said that he is willing to accept nuclear weapons, but he also "hopes" that the East and West can reach a disarmament agreement, so that West Germany does not need to make a decision to accept nuclear weapons.
    It sounds as if Adenauer's heart is not so bad. He also "hopes" for disarmament, and "hopes" that West Germany will not accept nuclear weapons.
    But why can't a disarmament agreement be reached? Isn't it precisely because Adenauer and the Western countries have created all kinds of obstacles? Isn't it precisely because Adenauer accepted nuclear weapons that the hope of disarmament was dashed? While Adenauer is working with the United States to desperately block the door to disarmament, he is hypocritically expressing "hope" that the door to disarmament can be opened. This fully demonstrates his hypocritical attitude. However, Adenauer's hypocritical attitude cannot deceive anyone.

    十足的虚伪
    最近，阿登纳“一再”说，他愿意接受核武器，但是他又“希望”东西方能达成裁军协议，可以使西德不需要作出接受核武器的决定。
    听起来好像阿登纳的心肠还不坏。他还“希望”裁军，“希望”西德不接受核武器哩。
    但是裁军问题为什么不能达成协议呢？不正是因为阿登纳和西方国家制造了各种各样的障碍吗？不正是因为阿登纳接受了核武器使裁军的希望泯灭了吗？阿登纳一面和美国一起拼命堵住裁军的大门，一面又在假惺惺地表示“希望”裁军的大门能够打开，这十足表现了他的虚伪的态度。但是，阿登纳的这种虚伪的态度是骗不了人的。
