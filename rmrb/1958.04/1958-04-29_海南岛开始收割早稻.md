Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 28th. The early rice harvest has begun on more than 2.6 million mu of land on Hainan Island. According to estimates of early rice growth and partial rice field harvest yields in Qiongdong, Wanning, Lehui, Wenchang, Tunchang, and other five counties, the average yield per mu will reach about 250 jin, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions have put forward the slogan of careful harvesting and threshing to ensure that every grain returns home, guaranteeing a bumper harvest.

This year, agricultural cooperatives in various regions of Hainan Island have vigorously launched campaigns to accumulate fertilizer, build water conservancy projects, and combat drought to protect seedlings during the Great Leap Forward, while also strengthening field management of early rice. As a result, the vigorous growth of early rice has been ensured, the yields of many originally low-yielding fields have been improved, and the yields of general rice fields have increased even more.

    海南岛开始收割早稻
    新华社广州电　海南岛二百六十多万亩早稻开始收割。据琼东、万宁、乐会、文昌、屯昌等五县早稻生长情况和部分稻田收割产量估计，平均亩产量将达到二百五十斤左右，约比去年增产30％以上。各地农业社都已提出细收细打，颗粒还家的口号，保证丰产丰收。
    海南岛各地农业社今年在大跃进中大力展开了积肥、兴修水利和抗旱保苗运动，同时加强了早稻的田间管理。这样做的结果，保证了早稻的旺盛生长，使不少原来低产田产量得以提高，一般稻田产量增产更多。
