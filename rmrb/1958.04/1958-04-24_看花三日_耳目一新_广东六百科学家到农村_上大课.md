Three Days of Flower Viewing: A Fresh Perspective
Six Hundred Guangdong Scientists Give a "Grand Lecture" in Rural Areas
Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that scientific workers must go to the masses, go to production, and practice again and again

(By our reporter He Xing) More than six hundred scientific workers who attended the First Guangdong Provincial Science Conference went to the countryside to attend a "grand lecture" and learn from the peasants during the conference. They made a three-day "whirlwind tour" of rural areas in Xinhui and Panyu counties. The scientists evaluated this visit as "three days of flower viewing, a fresh perspective." The idea that scientific research is divorced from production and divorced from the masses was particularly strongly criticized during this visit. The creations of the peasant masses in making every effort to overcome difficulties in the Great Leap Forward in Production inspired the scientists' sense of responsibility. They criticized and examined the past phenomenon of scientific research being divorced from production and the masses. The great changes in Xinhui County, where "rice paddies become granaries, barren mountains become fruit mountains, rivers become fish ponds, and rural areas become gardens," deeply moved the scientists. They believed that this was a spur and encouragement to the scientists. A Guangdong agricultural science research worker said: In recent years, there have been more than 440 agricultural scientific research projects in Guangdong, and although there have been many achievements, only 26 projects have been applied to production or provided scientific basis for production, which is indeed too few. The widespread use of biogas for power generation in rural Panyu County simply fascinated the scientists. They had been studying the problem of biogas power generation for many years without success, but the local masses only went to visit other places and quickly mastered and applied biogas power generation technology. After seeing these vivid creations of the masses, many scientific workers felt that they had received a profound education. They said with emotion: The production achievements and some experiments that the rural areas have already achieved, we are still preparing to experiment or have not even thought of at all, which shows that the masses have already walked ahead of us, and scientific research work lags behind reality! Yu Juying, a professor in the Chemical Engineering Department of the Institute of Technology, wrote a big-character poster when visiting Xinhui, entitled
  "I Saw Biogas," he said: "I knew for a long time that biogas could generate electricity, but I had no biogas in my eyes, and in fact, I had no masses in my eyes." In 1953, the Guangdong Science Popularization Association forwarded him a letter from the masses, talking about the problem of using biogas to generate electricity, but he thought the cost was too expensive and could not be used. A series of urgent problems raised by workers and peasants in production gave scientists a deeper understanding of
  the direction of "science must serve production." Luo Xiong Cai, vice president of the Institute of Technology, said that he would reverse the research style of being divorced from reality in the future, and would devote some time to studying and solving the problems existing in the development of rural industry. Many professors also held overnight seminars and wrote big-character posters during the visit to examine the past scientific work's ideas of being divorced from the masses and divorced from production. Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, talked to the scientists about his experience, saying that when he participated in the survey of the Sanmenxia Reservoir, he encountered poor soil and water conservation in the upper reaches, and more than 138,000 cubic meters of sand and mud were brought to the reservoir from the upper reaches every year, which was not easy to solve. At that time, many scientists were helpless in the face of this serious problem. Later, in Shaanxi, he saw the masses build countless fish-scale weirs on barren mountains, planting trees and fruit trees on the weirs, achieving "water does not flow down the slope, and soil does not leave the ditch." In a few years, the barren mountains became orchards. Therefore, the problem that scientists could not solve was solved by the masses. He also said that this time he went to Guifeng Mountain in Xinhui and saw that people's creations were even richer and more complete. This shows that scientific workers must go to the masses, go to production, and practice again and again.
    The revolutionary drive of the peasant masses also gave scientists a very profound education. Cai Wenxian, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University, asked a good question: Why are we not making as much progress as the peasants? He said that this is because the bourgeoisie's individualism among intellectuals is the most stubborn. A teacher wrote in a big-character poster on the boat: To ask the peasant brothers to write a chemical fertilizer formula may not be as good as us; but they have endless socialist revolutionary drive, so things that we cannot do or have not even thought of, they have all done. This fully shows that it is not enough to have knowledge without revolutionary drive, and that it is impossible without politics as the soul and commander. Wang Qi, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University, said: "Why do people work fifteen hours a day, while our professors only teach in the morning and not in the afternoon?" "The Longbang Cooperative runs a fertilizer factory, and everyone contributes ideas and efforts. Our professors should also contribute all their efforts to run the university well!"
    This group of scientific workers' visit to the countryside lasted for three days and returned to Guangzhou on the 20th. This visit was organized by the Guangdong Provincial Science Work Committee, and the purpose was to enable scientific workers to be inspired by the on-site visit and experience of the Great Leap Forward in rural production, so as to further overcome the phenomenon of scientific work being divorced from production and the masses, especially in combination with the ongoing provincial science work conference, to formulate a Great Leap Forward plan for scientific and technological research work from 1958 to 1962, so that scientific work can actively serve the Great Leap Forward in production.

    看花三日　耳目一新
    广东六百科学家到农村“上大课”
    中国科学院副院长竺可桢说，科学工作者必须到群众中去，到生产中去，实践再实践
    本报讯　记者河星报道：参加广东省第一次科学工作会议的六百多位科学工作者，在会议期间到农村去“上大课”，拜农民为老师。他们在新会县和番禺县农村作了历时三天“走马看花”的访问。科学家们对这次访问的评价是“看花三日，耳目一新”。科学研究工作脱离生产、脱离群众的思想在这次访问中受到特别有力的批判。农民群众在生产大跃进中千方百计、克服困难的创造，激发了科学家们的责任感。他们对过去科学研究工作脱离生产、脱离群众的现象作了批判和检查。新会县“稻田变谷仓，荒山变果山，河渊变鱼塘，农村变花园”的伟大变化使科学家们深受感动。他们认为这是对科学家们的一种鞭策和鼓励。一位广东农业科学研究工作人员说：这几年来，广东农业科学研究的四百四十多项次，虽有不少成绩，但是从整个来看，应用在生产上或提供生产上的科学根据的只有二十六个项次，这的确是太少了。番禺县农村普遍利用沼气发电，简直使科学家们迷住了，他们经过多年的研究沼气发电问题还未成功，可是当地的群众只是去别处参观一下回来，就这样迅速地掌握和运用了沼气发电技术，看到这些活生生的群众创造后，许多科学工作者都感到自己受到一次深刻的教育。他们感慨地说：农村已经取得的生产成就和一些试验，我们还正在准备试验或者根本还未想到，这说明群众已经走在我们的前头，科学研究工作落后于实际！工学院化工系教授余菊英在新会参观时写了一张大字报，题目是
  “我看见沼气了”，他说：“我早就知道沼气可以发电，但是眼中无沼气，实际上是眼中无群众”。1953年广东科普协会转给他一封群众来信，谈到利用沼气发电的问题，但是他认为成本太贵，不能利用。工人和农民们在生产中提出一系列急需解决的问题，使科学家们对于
  “科学必须为生产服务”的方向有了更深刻的了解。工学院副院长罗雄才表示今后要扭转脱离实际的研究作风，要抽出一部分时间专门研究解决农村发展工业中存在的问题。许多教授还为此在参观访问中连夜举行座谈会和写大字报，检查过去科学工作脱离群众、脱离生产的思想。中国科学院副院长竺可桢对科学家谈到他的体会时说，他在参加三门峡水库的勘测的时候，碰到上游水土保持不好，每年有十三万八千多土方的沙泥从上游带到水库来，不易解决。当时许多科学家面对这个严重问题都束手无策，后来在陕西看到群众把荒山筑成许许多多的鱼鳞堰，堰上栽满树林和果木，做到“水不下坡，土不出沟”，几年间荒山成了花果山。于是科学家不能解决的问题，群众解决了。他又说，这次到了新会圭峰山看到人们的创造更加丰富更加完整。这说明科学工作者必须到群众中去，到生产中去，实践再实践。
    农民群众的革命干劲，也给科学家以极深刻的教育。中山大学教授蔡文显问得好：为什么我们进步不如农民呢？他说，这是因为知识分子的资产阶级个人主义最顽强。一个教师在船上的大字报中写道：要农民兄弟写一个化学肥料方程式，可能不如我们；但他们具有无穷无尽的社会主义革命干劲，因此我们不能做甚至没有想过的事情，他们统统都干出来了。这充分说明单有知识没有革命干劲是不成的，说明没有政治做灵魂做统帅是不行的。中山大学教授王起说：“为什么人家一天工作十五小时，而我们教授却上午教书，下午不教？”，“龙榜社搞肥料厂，人人献计、献力，我们教授也应当贡献一切力量，把大学办好啊！”
    这批科学工作者下乡参观活动时间共三天，已在20日回到广州。这次参观活动是广东省科学工作委员会组织的，目的在于使科学工作者通过对农村生产大跃进的现场参观和感受启发，以便进一步克服科学工作中脱离生产、脱离群众的现象，特别是结合正在举行的全省科学工作会议，制订出1958—1962年的科学技术研究工作的大跃进规划，使科学工作积极为生产大跃进服务。
