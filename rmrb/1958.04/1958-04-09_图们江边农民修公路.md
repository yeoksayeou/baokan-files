Farmers in Baijin and Mingdong Townships, Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, used their own strength to build two roads totaling seventy-five li in length.

These two townships are located at the foot of Changbai Mountain, bordering the Tumen River on the national border. People had to climb steep cliffs and mountains to reach the county seat. The completion of these two roads is of great significance for the development of mountain production.

    图们江边农民修公路
    延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县的白金、明东两乡农民用自己的力量修建了两条共长七十五里的公路。
    这两个乡都在长白山麓，傍靠国境线图们江边。人民到县城都必须翻越峭壁峻岭，修通了这两条公路后对发展山区生产有重大的意义。
