Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 7th—The Zhongdong Hotel in the Central District of Jinan provides meticulous service to travelers and is known by many as a "traveler's home."

No matter the traveler's identity, upon arriving at the Zhongdong Hotel, they feel as comfortable and at ease as if they were at home. The staff is skilled at arranging accommodations according to the traveler's identity, work needs, and financial situation. If the traveler is a mother with children, the staff will take her to a quiet courtyard in the back, where the children can play freely without disturbing other travelers, and the children are less likely to run into the street and be hit by traffic. If the traveler is a Hui or other minority nationality, the hotel also prepares a set of rooms and living utensils specifically for them, taking care of their lives while also respecting their customs. If the traveler is a business person from out of town who needs to understand the local specialties market conditions in various parts of Shandong, the staff will also actively assist them. Even if the traveler encounters some problems they cannot solve themselves, the hotel will do everything possible to find a solution. In mid-March, a female traveler took Express Train 17 from Tianjin to Jinan and lost her scarf on the train. She was very anxious, and the hotel immediately wrote to the Shanghai Railway Station's passenger transportation office. Three or four days later, the Shanghai Railway Station mailed the scarf back. In addition, the hotel can help with purchasing train tickets, movie tickets, picking up luggage, purchasing goods, and so on.

What touches travelers the most is the warm concern and meticulous care given to elderly, weak, sick, and injured travelers with special difficulties. More than a year ago, Yuan Zhongchen from the 124th Exploration Team broke his leg and came to Jinan for treatment and stayed here. In addition to carrying him to the toilet and to play in the yard, the staff took turns taking care of him day and night, telling him stories of the "Legless Flying General" to encourage him to overcome difficulties and continue to serve the motherland. To strengthen Yuan Zhongchen's confidence, the staff specially invited a comrade with one leg who came to Jinan for a meeting to share his personal experiences, introducing how he overcame difficulties and now works as well as a healthy person. The staff often carried him, or paid for a pedicab to accompany him to see movies and plays; after the wound healed, they also carried him to take a bath. All of this often moved Yuan to tears. Yuan Zhongchen stayed in this hotel for more than eight months and became close friends with the staff. Now he has recovered his health and often writes from his work post to report on his situation. Last National Day, a female cadre from the Northeast passed through Jinan on her way home to visit relatives and also stayed at this hotel. Unexpectedly, she went into labor shortly after checking in. The staff rushed around to find a midwife for her, and she soon gave birth to a baby. The staff buried the soiled items and busied themselves buying eggs, cooking noodles, and taking care of her in every possible way. At that time, even the travelers staying there said: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, people from all over the country have become one family!

    旅客之家
    新华社济南7日电　济南市中区中东旅社，无微不至地为旅客服务，被许多旅客称为“旅客之家”。
    不管是什么身份的旅客，一到中东旅社，就感觉像到了家一样的方便如意。服务员们善于根据旅客的身份、工作需要和经济条件等，来分别安排住处。如果旅客是一位带有小孩的母亲，服务员就把她带到最后面一个僻静的院子里，在那里，小孩可以随便玩耍，既不影响其他旅客，孩子又不易跑到街上被车马撞着。假如旅客是回族或其他少数民族，旅社也专为他们准备一套房间和生活用具，在关照他们的生活中，也注意尊重他们的风俗习惯。如果旅客是一个外地来的商业人员，需要了解山东各地的土特产产地行情等，服务员们也积极地予以帮助。甚至旅客遇到一些自己不能解决的问题，旅社也能千方百计地设法解决。在3月中旬，有一位女旅客乘十七次快车从天津来济南，把围巾丢失在火车上，她非常着急，旅社就立即写信给上海车站客运室，三、四天后上海车站就把围巾寄来了。此外，如代客购买车票、影剧票、提取行李、代购货物等等，这个旅社都能帮助办理。
    最使旅客感动的，是一些老弱病伤等有特殊困难的旅客，在这里得到了热情的关怀和无微不至的照顾。一年多以前，一二四勘探队的袁锺琛折断了一只腿来济南治疗，曾住在这里。服务员除背他上厕所，到院里玩以外，还日夜轮流看护他，给他讲“无脚飞将军”，鼓励他战胜困难，继续为祖国服务。为了坚定袁锺琛的信心，服务员们还特地把来济南开会的一位一条腿的同志请来，让他现身说法，向袁锺琛介绍自己怎样克服困难、现在已和健康的人一样工作的情形。服务员们还常常背着他、或者自己出钱雇三轮车陪同他去看电影、看戏；伤口愈合后，还背他去洗澡，所有这些，常使袁感动得流泪。就这样，袁锺琛一直在这个旅社住了八个多月，和服务员成了知心的朋友。现在他已恢复了健康，常常从工作岗位上写信来报告他的情况。去年国庆节有一位女干部从东北回家省亲，路过济南也住到这个旅社里。不料刚刚住下就要分娩，服务员们东奔西跑为她请来了助产士，很快她就生下了一个娃娃。服务员替她埋了秽物，又忙着为她买鸡蛋、煮挂面，照顾得无微不至。当时连住在那里的旅客都说：在共产党领导下，山南海北都成了一家人！
