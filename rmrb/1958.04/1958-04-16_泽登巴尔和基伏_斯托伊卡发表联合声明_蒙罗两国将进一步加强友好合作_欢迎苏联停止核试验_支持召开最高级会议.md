Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, April 15th: A joint statement issued tonight by the government delegations of Mongolia and Romania said that both sides support the Soviet Union's decision to stop nuclear weapons testing and support the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit meeting, believing that this would make a significant contribution to easing international tensions.

    The statement was signed by Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia, and Chivu Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania.

    The statement said that both sides believe that banning nuclear weapons and eliminating military bases in foreign countries are important measures to prevent new wars. The governments of Mongolia and Romania condemn the United States for deploying atomic weapons and missile weapons in other countries, especially the act of equipping the West German army with these weapons.

    Both sides expressed support for the proposal to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in Europe and Asia.

    The statement said that the two delegations exchanged views on the continued development of friendly cooperation between the two countries and the current international situation, and reached a complete consensus.

Romania is helping Mongolia develop its forestry and timber processing industry.

    Both sides particularly pointed out that the historical document issued by the Moscow Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties last year is of great significance. Both sides reiterated that further strengthening and consolidating the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is particularly important.

    The statement said that both sides resolutely condemn acts of interference in the internal affairs of other countries and support the proposals for the reunification of Korea and Vietnam. Both sides believe that the initiative to withdraw the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea has made an important contribution to easing tensions in the Far East and peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

    The statement said that both sides believe that the People's Republic of China, as a world power, should be restored to its legitimate status in the United Nations.
