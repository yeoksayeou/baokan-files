Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 21st. Shanghai is taking measures in four areas—frequent inspections, frequent publicity, assigning management responsibilities for each tree, and disseminating techniques everywhere—to strengthen mass tree planting and seedling protection work and improve the survival rate of trees.

After Shanghai overfulfilled its task of planting 50 million trees in a concentrated half-month effort around the Qingming Festival, it inspected the quality of planting. The inspection revealed that some areas planted seedlings too deeply or too densely; some streets planted various trees without assigning specific people to manage them; and some residents and children in neighborhoods, although enthusiastic about planting trees, lacked knowledge of maintenance, and seedlings were often affected by excessive watering or overly compacted soil. These shortcomings were promptly remedied during the inspection.

The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee recently issued a notice to all citizens calling for the protection of trees, flowers, and grass. Newspapers and broadcasting tools in factories, streets, and rural areas also frequently issued calls to "organize and vigorously protect trees." A "Green Guard," organized by tens of thousands of Young Pioneers, has become a vital force in the city's efforts to promote tree protection.

Mass maintenance and management methods that specify locations, people, and quantities have been implemented in many neighborhoods, shops, and some factories and agricultural cooperatives in Shanghai. Hundreds of thousands of trees planted along sidewalks in the urban area have been largely surviving because nearby shops, schools, and organizations are responsible for watering, loosening the soil, and providing care and protection in a division of labor. Neighborhood residents' committees in various districts have organized children and the elderly to form tree protection teams, with each tree bearing a sign indicating the name of the tree protection group or individual. This has greatly reduced the phenomenon of children climbing trees and breaking branches, and residents have consciously changed bad habits such as drying clothes on trees. In the Jiaotong Township of the West Suburbs, four cooperatives planted tens of thousands of trees of the highest economic value along the sidewalks, and these are now numbered. Each person is responsible for maintaining five trees in their spare time according to the number sequence, and each production team selects an experienced member to guide the entire team in maintenance. This method has been very effective.

The work of quickly and effectively imparting maintenance techniques to the masses is underway in Shanghai. Many gardening workers who have been assigned to street offices are regularly contacting neighborhoods, shops, etc., to provide maintenance guidance. The Shanghai Juvenile Science and Technology Guidance Station has distributed tree maintenance materials to more than two thousand elementary schools throughout the city and holds regular technical lectures.

### 树树有人管　处处传技术  上海加强群众性养树护苗工作

    树树有人管　处处传技术
    上海加强群众性养树护苗工作
    据新华社上海21日电　上海市采取勤检查、勤宣传、树树归口管、处处传技术等四方面措施，加强群众性养树护苗工作，提高树木成活率。
    上海市在清明节前后突击半个月超额完成植树五千万株的任务以后，检查了植树质量。检查发现：有些地区并插树苗过深、过密；有些街道种植的各种乔木树没人专门管理；有些里弄居民和儿童虽有种树热情，但缺乏养护常识，苗木往往因吃水过多、壅土过实而影响成活。这些缺点在检查中都及时得到了补救。
    上海市人民委员会最近向全市人民发出了爱护树木花草的通告，报纸和工厂、街道、农村的广播工具也经常发出“组织起来大力养护树木”的呼声。一支由数以万计的少先队员组织起来的“绿化近卫军”，已经成为全市宣传养护树木的生力军。
    定点、定人、定量的群众性养护管理办法已在上海的很多里弄、商店和一些工厂、农业社里推行。在市区人行道旁种植的数十万株树，由于有附近的商店、学校、机关分工负责，及时浇水、松土、包养包护，绝大部分已经成活。各区里弄居民委员会把儿童、老年人组织起来，成立护树队，每棵树上挂一块护树小组名称或个人名字的牌子。这样就使儿童爬树、折树枝的现象大大减少，居民们也自觉地改变在树上晒衣服等不良习惯。西郊区交通乡四个社种植在人行道旁的成万棵最有经济价值的树木，现在都编上号，每人依号次在业余时间负责养护五棵，每个生产队挑选一个有经验的社员指导全队养护。这种办法效果很好。
    迅速有效地把养护技术传授给群众的工作正在上海展开。已下放到街道办事处的许多园林工人，正固定地同里弄、商店等联系，进行养护指导活动。上海少年科学技术指导站向全市两千多个小学印发了养护树木的资料，举办了经常性的技术讲座。
