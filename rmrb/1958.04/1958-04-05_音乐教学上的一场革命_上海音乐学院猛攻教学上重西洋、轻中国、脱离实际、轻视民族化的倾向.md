    A Revolution in Music Education
    Shanghai Conservatory of Music Vigorously Attacks the Tendency of Emphasizing the West, Neglecting China, Detachment from Reality, and Disregarding Nationalization in Teaching
    (Our Correspondent Yang Ying reports) The Shanghai Conservatory of Music, through the "Double-Anti" movement, has carried out a revolution in music education.
    As the "Double-Anti" movement began, tens of thousands of big-character posters at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music quickly targeted the most fundamental problems of the institute: the tendency of emphasizing the West, neglecting China, detachment from reality, and disregarding nationalization in teaching. The big-character posters from teachers and students revealed that the biggest waste of the institute was that the people it trained could not well meet the needs of society. Many courses in the school only taught Western music, not Chinese music. Subjects like musical composition analysis and orchestration never discussed Chinese works. Students in the conducting department only learned to conduct Western orchestras. Students in the piano department cited examples of the prize-winning pieces in the institute's piano composition competition in 1957, which were in the same style as "Spring Snow," "Sonatina," and "Fantasia," popular at the Paris Conservatory a hundred years ago. Ju Xiufang, a student at the institute, won a gold medal for her folk song solo at the 6th World Youth Festival in Moscow last year, but previously, teachers had only given her a score of three for her singing lessons.
    Before the "Double-Anti" movement, the institute's Party and government leaders, in conjunction with conveying the spirit of the Shanghai Municipal Party Congress of the Communist Party of China, examined the teaching policy, and teachers also launched serious criticism and self-criticism. Ding Shande, vice president and composer, examined himself for only stopping at the theoretical level regarding the policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He himself preferred instrumental music composition and created very few forms that workers, peasants, and soldiers liked, believing that popularization work should be done by others. Professor Fan Jisen examined himself for emphasizing professional work and neglecting politics, often using technique to measure all musical works.
    During the movement, teachers and students criticized and exposed each other. Some teachers described their feelings at the beginning of the movement as: "Seeing big-character posters made my heart pound, and watching slideshows and living newspaper plays made me break out in a cold sweat," but now they feel relaxed and full of energy. Shi Shenghua, a lecturer in the piano department, cried when she first saw a big-character poster criticizing her for not being serious about her teaching work and for being listless. With the help and encouragement of teachers and students, she is now not only preparing lessons carefully but also challenging singer Cai Shaoxu, aiming to perform one hundred times this year and hold four piano recitals featuring all Chinese works. Many teachers made self-criticisms on big-character posters, and the opinions students raised to teachers were sharp and sincere, making the relationship between teachers and students unprecedentedly close.
    After criticism and self-criticism, many teachers changed their past erroneous ideas of scholars despising each other, being superficially amicable but speaking ill of each other behind their backs, and putting personal fame and gain first, achieving sincere unity.
    After rejecting conservative ideas and thoroughly exposing and criticizing bourgeois literary and artistic thought and teaching thought, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music broke with so-called regularization and firmly grasped the policy of implementing nationalization, connecting with reality, and facing the workers, peasants, and soldiers in teaching, carrying out a revolution from teaching policy, teaching content, and teaching methods.
    Teachers and students no longer improved themselves behind closed doors; they rushed out of the campus, went deep into the masses of workers and peasants, and into the fiery life, to absorb the source of creation. Teachers and students from the composition department went to the Great China Rubber Factory and the Jiangnan Shipyard, and were deeply moved by seeing the workers' enthusiasm. They created and performed on the spot, which was very successful. Teachers and students in this department have recently created more than 300 mass songs and other musical works. On weekends, teachers and students also go to the streets and squares to hold concerts. Students from the affiliated secondary school of the institute performed at the Great New Amusement Park, which was the first concert held at a Shanghai amusement park in decades. Famous singers Cai Shaoxu and Gao Zhilan also frequently went to worker's dormitories and factory dining halls to sing.
    Teachers and students also extensively became related with workers, and have begun to establish relationships with more than 40 factories and shops, tutoring workers' cultural and artistic activities, teaching workers to sing and learn conducting, and running training classes, etc.
    In terms of curriculum, major reforms have also been carried out. Each department has formulated revolutionary improvement plans, and the proportion of Chinese teaching materials in many courses has greatly increased. The composition department will focus on guiding students to use national styles to reflect reality. Teachers have begun to compile textbooks on national instrumental music methods. The vocal music department originally planned to open a folk singing major in 1960, but will now open it in the second half of this year. The orchestral department stipulates that each teacher must learn a national instrumental music. The conducting department will add national instrumental music courses.

    音乐教学上的一场革命
    上海音乐学院猛攻教学上重西洋、轻中国、脱离实际、轻视民族化的倾向
    本报讯　记者杨瑛报道：上海音乐学院通过双反运动，在音乐教学上进行了一次革命。
    双反运动开始，上海音乐学院的几万张大字报的矛头，很快指向该院最根本性的问题：教学上重西洋、轻中国、脱离实际、轻视民族化的倾向。师生们的大字报揭发该院最大的浪费是：培养出来的人不能很好的适合社会的需要。学校里很多课程只讲西洋的，不讲中国的。像作品分析、配器等从来不讲中国的。指挥系的学生们只学西洋乐队的指挥。钢琴系学生的大字报列举1957年该院钢琴作曲比赛得奖的乐曲，和一百年前巴黎音乐院风行的乐曲“春雪”“小奏鸣曲”“幻想曲”的风格完全一样。该院学生鞠秀芳去年在莫斯科第六届世界青年联欢节上以民歌独唱得金质奖，以前教师给她的演唱课评分只有三分。
    双反运动前，该院党政负责人结合传达中共上海市代表会议的精神，对教学方针作了检查，教师中也展开了严肃的批评与自我批评。副院长、作曲家丁善德检查自己对文艺为工农兵服务的方针，只停留在理论上，自己偏重于器乐作曲，工农兵喜爱的形式创作得很少，他认为普及工作应该由别人去做。教授范继森检查自己重业务，轻政治，常常用技巧来衡量一切音乐作品。
    运动中，教师和学生都相互批评，相互揭发。有些教师描述自己在运动开始时的心情是：“看大字报心惊肉跳，看幻灯片、活报剧冷汗浃背”，而现在却是心情舒畅，干劲十足。钢琴系讲师石圣华，第一次看到大字报批评她对教学工作不认真，有暮气，气得哭了。经过师生们的帮助和鼓励，现在她不但认真地备课，并且还向歌唱家蔡绍序挑战，要在今年演出一百次，并且举行四次全部是中国作品的钢琴独奏会。许多教师在大字报上作了自我检查，学生们对老师提的意见都尖锐而诚恳，师生关系空前密切。
    不少教师经过批评与自我批评，改掉了过去那种文人相轻，表面和气，背后说坏话，个人名利第一的错误思想，达到真诚的团结。
    在反掉保守思想，彻底揭发批判资产阶级文艺思想和教学思想之后，上海音乐学院打破了所谓正规化，紧紧抓住贯彻教学民族化、联系实际、面向工农兵的方针，从教学方针、教学内容和教学方法上，进行了一场革命。
    师生们不再关门提高，他们冲出校门，深入到工农群众中去，到火热的生活中去，吸取创作的源泉。作曲系师生到大中华橡胶厂、江南造船厂，亲眼看到工人们的干劲，感动极了，他们现场创作，现场演出，十分成功。这个系的师生最近已创作了三百多首群众歌曲和其他音乐作品，休息日，师生们还到街头广场上去开音乐会。该院附中的学生到大新游乐场去演出，这是几十年来上海游乐场举行的第一个音乐会。著名歌唱家蔡绍序、高芝兰等也经常到会园里、工厂的饭厅里去演唱。
    师生们还广泛地和工人攀亲，他们已开始和四十多家工厂商店建立关系，辅导职工的文艺活动，教工人们演唱和学习指挥，开办训练班等等。
    课程方面，也进行了重大改革。各系都订出了革命性的改进的方案，许多课程中国教材比重大大增加。作曲系将着重辅导学生运用民族风格反映现实。教师们已着手编写民族乐器法的教材。声乐系原定在1960年开设民间演唱专业，现在将提前在今年下半年开设。管弦系规定每个教师要学会一种民族器乐。指挥系将增加民族器乐课程。
