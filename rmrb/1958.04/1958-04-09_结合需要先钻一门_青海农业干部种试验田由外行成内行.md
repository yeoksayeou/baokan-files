Combine with Needs, First Master One Skill
Agricultural Cadres in Qinghai Province Become Experts from Laymen by Planting Experimental Fields
(Our dispatch) Qinghai Province's agricultural region county leaders are all combining production labor with learning scientific knowledge by planting experimental fields.

Qinghai Province's agricultural region has complex natural conditions. To technically guarantee a great leap forward in production, county leaders have been focusing on studying one or two specialized topics in agricultural production since last winter, based on their needs. Huangzhong County has a vast territory, and local farmers have always not valued fertilization. Liu Yi, the First Secretary of the CPC Huangzhong County Committee, focused on studying soil science and fertilizer knowledge. In addition to asking agricultural technicians to guide him in reading relevant books and five agricultural magazines, he also personally found fertilizer sources, made fertilizer, and conducted various fertilizer effect tests. Under his influence, cadres throughout the county are able to avoid speaking like laymen and acting like laymen in the composting, processing, and use of various farm fertilizers and granular fertilizers, and they basically understand the relationship between fertilizers and soil.

The Mutual Aid Tu Autonomous County is often threatened by drought. Wu Zhengfu, the First Secretary of the County Committee, focused on studying water conservancy issues, often leading the masses to climb mountains and ridges to find water sources and plan canals. After several months of study and practice, he is now able to independently carry out canal alignment and measurement work. Six of the sixteen winding mountain canals under construction were personally surveyed for water sources and aligned by him. Most of the cadres in the autonomous county have also gradually transformed from laymen to experts in water conservancy construction, and some have even created simple levels, boom delivery tools, and other tools.

Because the leaders of the aforementioned counties have set a good example, a trend of learning scientific knowledge has begun to take shape in the agricultural regions of various counties. Some counties have already begun organizing large classes, while others are planning to open cadre spare-time technical schools or have agricultural technology extension stations divide and conquer to tutor cadres in their studies.

### 结合需要先钻一门  青海农业干部种试验田由外行成内行

    结合需要先钻一门
    青海农业干部种试验田由外行成内行
    本报讯　青海省农业区各县的领导干部都在结合着种试验田的生产劳动学习科学知识。
    青海省农业区自然条件很复杂，为了在技术上保证生产大跃进，各县的领导干部去冬以来就根据需要着重学习一两个农业生产上的专门课题。湟中县地域辽阔，当地农民一向不重视施肥，中共湟中县委第一书记柳一同志就重点学习土壤学和肥料知识。他除了请农业技术干部指导阅读有关书籍和五种农业杂志，还亲自动手找肥源、制肥和做各种肥效测定的试验。在他的影响下，全县干部对于各种农家肥料和颗粒肥料的沤制、加工和使用，都能够做到不讲外行话，不干外行事，肥料与土壤的关系也基本上弄清楚了。
    互助土族自治县常受干旱威胁，县委第一书记吴正夫同志就着重研究水利问题，经常带领群众攀山越岭寻找水源和规划渠道。经过几个月的学习和实践，他已能独立做渠道的定线和测量工作了，正在施工的十六条盘山干渠，有六条是他亲自勘查水源和定线的。自治县的大部分干部对于兴修水利也逐渐由外行变成了内行，有的人还创造了简便水平仪、吊杆送土器等工具。
    由于上述那些县的领导干部做出了较好榜样，农业区各县学习科学知识已经开始形成风气。有的县已经开始组织上大课，有的县正在计划开办干部业余技术学校，或由农业技术推广站分片包干辅导干部学习。　（杨立本）
