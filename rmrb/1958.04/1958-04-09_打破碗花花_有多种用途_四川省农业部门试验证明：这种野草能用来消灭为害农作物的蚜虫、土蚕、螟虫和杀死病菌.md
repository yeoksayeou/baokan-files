"Broken Bowl Flower" Has Multiple Uses
Agricultural Department of Sichuan Province Proves Through Experimentation: This Weed Can Be Used to Eliminate Aphids, Cutworms, and Stem Borers that Harm Crops, and Kill Bacteria

(Our newspaper reporter Sun Yuedong reports) The weed "Broken Bowl Flower," which can be used to eliminate mosquitoes and flies, has been proven to have new uses in agriculture and medicine. This has been determined recently through research and experimentation.

"Broken Bowl Flower" can be used to eliminate aphids, cutworms, and stem borers that harm crops. According to experiments by the agricultural department of Sichuan Province, squeezing out the juice from the stems and leaves of this weed, and mixing twenty catties of juice with one hundred catties of water, can be used to irrigate areas where cutworms are present, and kill the cutworms. To kill aphids, use five catties of juice mixed with one hundred catties of water, and spray with a sprayer. These two methods can achieve a 70% effectiveness rate. Because the juice from the stems and leaves of this weed has fertilizing properties, and can promote crop growth, it is more effective than using other pesticides. This weed can also kill stem borers, and the extent of its effectiveness is currently being studied.

According to experiments by the Biochemistry and Medicinal Botany teaching and research sections of Sichuan Medical College, protoanemonin extracted from the juice contained in the stems and leaves of the "Broken Bowl Flower" can be used in medicine to kill bacteria. A solution of protoanemonin (the crystalline form of protoanemonin) at a concentration of only one part per 60,000 can kill Staphylococcus aureus (a type of pyogenic bacteria); a solution of protoanemonin at a concentration of one part per 80,000 can kill E. coli.

"Broken Bowl Flower" is a plant of the Ranunculaceae family, growing in ditches, streamsides, and shady, damp places in forests. In addition to Sichuan Province, it is also produced in Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong and other provinces. According to Professors Xie Chengke and Xu Zhonglv of Sichuan Medical College, farmers collectively refer to "Broken Bowl Flower" and other weeds such as Anemone hupehensis, Ainsliaea henryi, and wild cotton as wild cotton. Their stems and leaves all contain protoanemonin, and also have the effect of killing pests and bacteria.

Currently, Sichuan Province is widely promoting the use of "Broken Bowl Flower" to kill mosquito and fly larvae and adults.

    “打破碗花花”有多种用途
    四川省农业部门试验证明：这种野草能用来消灭为害农作物的蚜虫、土蚕、螟虫和杀死病菌
    本报讯　记者孙跃冬报道：能用来消灭蚊蝇的野草“打破碗花花”，证明在农业上和在医药上有新的用途。这是最近经过研究试验确定的。
    “打破碗花花”能够用来消灭为害农作物的蚜虫、土蚕和螟虫。据四川省农业部门的试验，将这种野草的茎叶的浆汁榨出，每二十斤兑水一百斤，用来浇灌发生土蚕的地方，就能将土蚕杀死。杀灭蚜虫，则用浆汁五斤兑水一百斤，装进喷雾器内喷射。这两种效果可达70％。因为这种野草的茎叶浆汁有肥力，能够促进农作物生长，因此比使用其他治虫药物的效果好。这种野草也能杀灭螟虫，现在正在研究效果大小。
    根据四川医学院生化、生药两个教研室的试验，证明从“打破碗花花”的茎叶所含的浆汁中提取出来的白头翁素，能在医学上应用来杀灭病菌。只须用六万分之一的原白头翁素（白头翁素的结晶体）溶液，就能将金黄色葡萄球菌（一种化脓菌）杀死；用八万分之一的原白头翁素溶液，就能将大肠杆菌杀死。
    “打破碗花花”是毛茛科植物，生长在沟边、溪旁和树林中阴湿的地方。除四川省出产外，江苏、江西、福建、湖北、云南、贵州、广东等省也都出产。据四川医学院谢成科、徐仲吕两教授谈称，“打破碗花花”和另外的野草秋牡丹、大火草、野棉花等农民统称野棉花。它们的茎叶都含有白头翁素，同样有杀灭害虫和病菌的效能。
    目前，四川省正普遍推广用“打破碗花花”来灭蚊蝇幼虫和成虫的办法。
