    Collection of Poems by Vietnamese Poets

    "Fighting Homeland," published by New Literature and Art Publishing House, is a collection of poems by the famous Vietnamese poet Hoang Trung Thong. The poet uses simple and vivid verses to write about the fighting achievements of the Vietnamese people against the colonialists and their daily life scenes, reflecting their love for the motherland and their hatred for the enemy. The poems feature many realistic and touching artistic images, such as the female traffic officer who sticks to her post, the old woman who studies diligently, and so on. (Liang)

    新文艺出版社出版的“战斗的故乡”，是越南著名诗人黄忠通的一本诗集。诗人用朴素而生动的诗句，写出了越南人民反对殖民者的战斗业绩以及他们的日常生活情景，反映出了他们对祖国的热爱和对敌人的仇恨。诗中出现了不少真实感人的艺术形象，如坚守岗位的女交通员，努力学习文化的老大妈等等。　（梁）
