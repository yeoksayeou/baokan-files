    Strange Facts
    Fish have a sense of taste. They are good at distinguishing sweet tastes, but not so good at distinguishing bitter tastes. The taste organs of the pike are in its mouth, the gurnard (sea rooster) has them on the radial bones of its pectoral fins, and the carp has them all over its body.

    奇妙的事实
    鱼是有味觉的。但它善于辨别甜的，而不善于辨别苦的。梭鱼的味觉器官在口腔里，鲂鮄——海公鸡——在胸鳍的桡骨头上，鲤鱼则全身皆是。
