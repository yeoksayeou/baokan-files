    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In this season of warm spring and blooming flowers, farmers in the mountainous areas of Guizhou, who have traditionally been unaccustomed to fish farming, are now utilizing rice paddies, mountain ponds, and reservoirs to develop the freshwater fish farming industry.
    Up to the beginning of April, farmers in various regions have released more than 30 million fish fry, including black carp, grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp, introduced from other places, into ponds. This accounts for half of the province's planned fish farming volume for this year. In Dejiang County, all 38 newly built ponds by the vast agricultural cooperatives are now being used for fish farming. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the fish production will reach 150,000 jin, with an average income of 43 yuan per person. In Xianhui County's Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative, a high-altitude mountainous area previously considered unsuitable for fish farming, fish have also been raised in the 15 newly built ponds this year.

    贵州山区养淡水鱼
    据新华社讯　在这春暖花开的季节，历来不习惯养鱼的贵州山区农民，正利用稻田和山塘、水库来发展养鱼事业。
    到4月上旬止，各地农民已把从外地引进的青、草、鲢、鳙等鱼种三千多万尾放入水塘，占今年全省计划养鱼数的一半。德江县广大农业社，今年新修的三十八个水塘都养了鱼，预计年底可产鱼十五万斤，平均每人收入四十三元。过去认为不能养鱼的高寒山区鳛水县先锋农业社，今年也在新修的十五个水塘里养了鱼。
