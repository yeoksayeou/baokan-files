A person with an open nature and a straightforward heart is always likeable. Our classical novels and dramas have created many such lovable characters for us. Zhang Fei, who lashed the督邮 (an imperial inspector) in anger, Lu Zhishen, who killed the bully Zhen Guanxi with three punches, and Li Kui, who wreaked havoc in the Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness, are so widely circulated and praised by the people precisely because they possess the above-mentioned characteristics. They uphold justice, are not afraid of the powerful, dare to speak and act, and their words match their deeds. And when they know they are wrong, they can admit their mistakes without concealment. Li Kui, upon hearing that Song Jiang had seized a respectable woman, damaging the reputation of Liangshan Marsh, ran to the Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness with an axe in hand, angrily砍倒 (cut down) the banner of "Acting on behalf of Heaven," and wanted to chop off Song Jiang's head. When he realized that he had misunderstood the facts, he carried thorns on his back to plead guilty, asking Song Jiang to chop off his "black head."

This kind of forthright character is the true color of the Chinese working people.

We Communists have always been people who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. When dark clouds loomed and evil forces were rampant, our revolutionary predecessors dared to think of overthrowing them; dared to speak out their political主張 (proposition) – to realize Communism in China; and, unafraid of all kinds of persecution, dared to fight for their ideals. "Heads can be severed, but our will cannot be bent." Many revolutionary martyrs demonstrated noble integrity in the enemy's prisons and execution grounds. Before their execution, they sang the Internationale and shouted "Long live the Chinese Communist Party," believing that their ideals would eventually be realized.

Daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act are the fine traditions of our Party. Our Party has always advocated speaking boldly, thinking independently, and encouraging everyone to "speak out freely, say everything you know." After the liberation of the whole country, the people have seized power, creating a very good environment for everyone to speak boldly and do their best. However, some people still look at the new society with old eyes. "Only speak three-tenths of your mind to others, never give your whole heart away" is still their creed. They are hesitant, reluctant to speak, and always seem to keep a distance from the Party and the people. This is nothing more than the mischief of庸俗 (vulgar) ideas of fearing loss and gain.

Since we are Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres, who, even in the era of the Kuomintang's dark rule, when there was a constant danger to life, were still able to persevere in the struggle unyieldingly, then in today's new society with full democracy and freedom, as long as we wholeheartedly serve socialism, we can boldly say what we have to say; if we believe that our own opinion is the truth, we should insist on it and fight against wrong opinions. Temporary setbacks may occur, but as the saying goes: "Good deeds will be rewarded, and evil deeds will be punished; if not punished, the time has not come yet." Truth will inevitably triumph.

Of course, what we say may not all be correct, and what we believe to be the truth may not be the truth, but it is beneficial to speak out boldly. Through debate, we can clarify right and wrong, which is educational for both others and ourselves. People of our era, especially Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres, should have this kind of spirit. Can it be that Communists are not even more daring to speak and act than Zhang Fei, Lu Zhishen, and Li Kui?

    大丈夫敢说敢为
    曾田家
    性情开朗、心直口快的人，总是惹人喜欢的。在我国的古典小说和戏剧中为我们塑造了不少这样可爱的人物。怒鞭督邮的张飞，三拳打死镇关西的鲁智深和大闹忠义堂的李逵，在人民中之所以能够广泛流传，人人称颂，正因为他们具有上面的那些特点。他们坚持正义，不畏强暴，敢说敢为，心口如一。而当他们知道自己错了的时候，也能毫不遮掩地承认错误。李逵因为听说宋江抢了良家妇女，坏了梁山泊的名气，手执板斧怒气冲冲跑上忠义堂，砍倒了“替天行道”的旗子，并要砍宋江的脑袋。到弄清楚是自己弄错了事实时，他就负荆请罪，要求宋江砍去他的那颗“黑头”。
    这种爽朗的性格，正是中国劳动人民的本色。
    我们共产党人从来就是敢想、敢说、敢干的人。当黑云压天，恶势力横行的时代，我们的革命先辈就敢于想去推翻它；敢于说出自己的政治主张——要在中国实现共产主义；并不怕种种迫害，敢于为自己的理想而奋斗。“头可断，志不可屈”，许多革命烈士在敌人的监狱中、刑场上表现了崇高的气节，他们在临刑前高唱国际歌，高呼中国共产党万岁，相信他们的理想终会实现。
    敢想、敢说、敢干是我们共产党的优良传统。我们党一向就提倡大胆说话，独立思考，要大家“知无不言，言无不尽”。全国解放了，人民掌握了政权，为大家创造了很好的大胆说话和各尽所能的环境。然而，有些人还是以老眼光看新社会，“逢人只说三分话，未可全抛一片心”还是他们的信条，他们扭扭捏捏，欲言又止，和党和人民总是若即若离。这无非是患得患失的庸俗思想在作怪。
    既然是共产党员和革命干部，在国民党黑暗统治的时代，时时刻刻都有生命危险，尚且能不屈不挠坚持斗争，在今天已有充分民主自由的新社会里，只要自己一心一德为社会主义服务，有话就可以大胆的说；若认为自己的意见是真理，就应该坚持，和错误的意见进行斗争。一时的不如意也许是有的，但是俗话说得好：“善有善报，恶有恶报，不是不报，时候未到”，真理必然会获得胜利。
    当然，自己说的话未必都正确，自己认为是真理的也未必是真理，但是大胆说出来有好处。可以经过辩论，明确是非，对别人对自己都有教育意义。我们这时代的人，尤其是共产党员和革命干部应当有这种气魄。难道共产主义者还不能比张飞、鲁智深和李逵更敢说敢为吗？
