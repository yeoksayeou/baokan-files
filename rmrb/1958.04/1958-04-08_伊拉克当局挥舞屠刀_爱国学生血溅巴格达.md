Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, April 6th: News from here today states that Iraqi authorities have carried out a new massacre of students who demonstrated in Baghdad on the 5th.

These students were demonstrating in support of the demands of enlightened Iraqi figures. Last week, these enlightened Iraqi figures delivered a letter to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said, demanding that Iraq withdraw from the Baghdad Pact and adopt an enlightened Arab policy.

According to the "Al-Nour" newspaper here, Iraqi students chanted slogans during the demonstration on the 5th: opposing the Nuri al-Said government and the Baghdad Pact, and demanding that residents have civil rights. When they entered the cordon, the police opened fire on them. According to "Al-Sahafa," twelve people died and many were injured.

According to "Al-Nour," Iraqi students and youth held similar demonstrations two days ago. The people's hatred of the current regime is deepening, and a tense situation is looming over the entire Baghdad.

    伊拉克当局挥舞屠刀
    爱国学生血溅巴格达
    新华社大马士革6日电　今天这里的消息说，伊拉克当局对5日在巴格达举行示威游行的学生进行了新的屠杀。
    这些学生是为了支持伊拉克开明人士的要求而举行示威游行的。伊拉克的开明人士在上星期曾经交给伊拉克首相努里·赛义德一封信，要求伊拉克退出巴格达条约，并且采取开明的阿拉伯政策。
    据这里的“光明报”报道，伊拉克学生们5日在示威游行时高呼口号：反对努里·赛义德政府和巴格达条约，并要求居民有公民权利。当他们进入警戒圈以后，警察就向他们开了火。据“沙牧国报”说，有十二个人死亡，许多人受伤。
    据“光明报”报道，伊拉克学生和青年两天前曾举行了同样的示威游行。人民仇恨现政权的情绪日益加深了，紧张局势笼罩着整个巴格达。
