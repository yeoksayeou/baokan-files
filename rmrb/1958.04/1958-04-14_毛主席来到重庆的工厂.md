	Chairman Mao Visits Factories in Chongqing
	—Our Chongqing Correspondent
	Chairman Mao has come to Chongqing. On the afternoon of March 28th, Chairman Mao visited the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory.

	After a night of rain, the mountain city of Chongqing was lush and green, even more beautiful. At 4:30 that afternoon, Chairman Mao's car stopped in the yard of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill workshop. "Chairman Mao is here!" "Chairman Mao is here!" The workers rushed to tell each other, and soon the yard, the entrance, and the roadside were crowded with people. Everyone's heart was pounding. In this tense and happy moment, many people simply couldn't believe their eyes. No, it was completely true, Chairman Mao was right in front of us. He smiled kindly, nodded, clapped his hands, and walked past the people. Everyone could clearly see that Chairman Mao was wearing a gray overcoat, his face was radiant, and he was tall and strong, looking only about fifty years old, much younger than he appeared in movies and photos. When the workers saw our great leader so healthy, they all believed that this was the greatest happiness for the 600 million people of the whole country. Everyone was extremely excited, clapping and cheering: "Hello, Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Many people were so happy that tears welled up in their eyes on the spot.

	Chairman Mao came to the rolling mill workshop. The first steel rail produced in our country after liberation was rolled in this workshop. The two rolling mills here were bought from England by Zhang Zhidong sixty years ago. Now these two old machines have regained their youthful brilliance, and they are spinning rapidly, making a "roaring" sound. In 1951, these two rolling mills only rolled more than 30,000 tons of steel, but this year they can reach more than 350,000 tons. At the steel plate bridge at the entrance of the workshop, Chairman Mao saw the slogan "Catch up with England in Fifteen Years" welded by the workers. In order not to forget the great task put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao at every moment, the workers specially welded this slogan on the steel plate bridge that they must pass every day to and from work, expressing their strong determination. Chairman Mao walked to the steel plate section and asked in detail about the production of steel plates. The company manager, engineers, and others answered one by one. Seeing that the workers were very energetic, operating like tigers in the high temperature, Chairman Mao walked straight to the vicinity of the rolling mill and stood there for ten minutes, carefully watching the workers' operations. The red-hot steel plate slid down from the rollers, rolling past him. Chairman Mao smiled, nodded to the workers, and waved hello. The workers operated with a hundred times more energy, while cheering: "Hello, Chairman Mao." The workers in the steel plate section were very moved to see Chairman Mao so busy, yet taking the trouble to run so far to their workshop. In the past, they rolled eighteen to twenty steel plates per hour, but that day, encouraged by Chairman Mao, they created a record of producing twenty-four steel plates per hour.

	After watching for a while at the flattening machine, Chairman Mao came to the rail steel section. This machine with great power, after Zhang Zhidong bought it, was abandoned aside after a few years. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was moved from Hanyang to Chongqing and was abandoned on the riverside, unattended, with all the parts completely missing. After liberation, the workers cleaned it up and equipped it with hundreds of tons and more than three thousand parts. So, steel rails were rolled at the beginning of 1951. Chairman Mao looked at this machine. At this time, the grooves were filled with steel billets, shuttling back and forth like fire dragons. Chairman Mao asked what was produced here and how many types, and then walked to the middle shearing machine, standing on the operating platform and carefully watching the workers cut the red-hot steel billets section by section. Then he turned to the steel plate sorting yard and came to the cold shearing machine to watch the workers cut steel plates. Chairman Mao asked the workers about the situation of cutting steel plates. He was so interested in every bit of the workers' labor products, watched so carefully, and asked so specifically; many people applauded excitedly. Chairman Mao looked up and saw the crane operator, so he waved to the worker; the worker was also excitedly watching Chairman Mao, smiling at his most beloved leader.

	Chairman Mao slowly walked up a slope of seventy or eighty meters from the finished product warehouse. Seeing the bamboo shed warehouse, he asked with concern: "What is this bamboo house built for?"
	The secretary of the company's Party committee replied: "To stack steel plates."
	Chairman Mao learned that the steel plates were carried up and down manually after being rolled out, so he asked: "Can some mechanized transportation be implemented?"
	When walking to the iron plate bridge, Chairman Mao saw many big-character posters pasted on both sides, so he asked: "Are all the big-character posters pasted here? Are these all big-character posters?" He was attracted by a big-character poster titled "Little Foot Woman," stopped, looked at it, and asked:
	"Who wrote this?"
	The general branch secretary of the workshop replied:
	"I wrote it."
	Chairman Mao smiled and asked again:
	"Who is this talking about?"
	The content of this big-character poster was a criticism of the conservative thinking of the engineers in the technical group of the large rolling mill workshop. When they discussed this year's plan, they believed that the factory's proposal to advance towards the goal of 350,000 tons was unfounded and could only complete 335,000 tons. Now the facts prove that it is no problem to complete 350,000 tons this year. An engineer following beside the Chairman replied:
	"This is a criticism of a group of intellectuals in our technical group who dare not take bold steps forward in the Great Leap Forward."
	When Chairman Mao was about to leave the gate of this workshop, two female apprentice workers ran up to him, excitedly shaking the Chairman's hand, one each. It turned out that the workers in the workshop were afraid that everyone would rush to shake hands, which would tire the Chairman. So, they entrusted these two female apprentice workers to represent their respect for Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao repeatedly replied: "Good, good, hello to you!"

	From the large rolling mill workshop to the large open-hearth furnace workshop, there were several thousand people waiting for Chairman Mao on both sides of this road. When Chairman Mao saw them, he got out of the car and repeatedly waved to everyone.

	When entering the gate of the large open-hearth furnace workshop, Chairman Mao stopped to look at the big-character posters written by the workers. The 36,000 big-character posters written by the workers in the past five days and five nights were all pasted here. The content was mostly criticism of conventional rules and conservative backward phenomena. The workers were particularly happy to see Chairman Mao reading the big-character posters they had written. Many workers were originally standing behind the bamboo mat on which the big-character posters were pasted. They poked their heads out, smiling at Chairman Mao, and greeting Chairman Mao.

	The workers in the large open-hearth furnace workshop had a "three-level jump" in production in the past twenty days—successively trial-producing double-tap steel, double-slot steel, and three-slot steel. They were extremely energetic. Chairman Mao was surrounded by workers and walked onto the platform. Chairman Mao slowly walked closer to the No. 4 furnace, watching the young workers adding fluorite to the furnace. The young men all regarded working in front of Chairman Mao as the greatest happiness in their lives. Who wouldn't want to show off their skills? While watching Chairman Mao, they shoveled the materials into the furnace with shovels, shoveling so much, so accurately, and so quickly. Chairman Mao moved closer to the furnace opening three times in a row, carefully looking into the furnace with blue glasses, asking how big the furnace was, what type it was, and what raw materials were needed; the engineers next to him answered.

	Then Chairman Mao asked: "What is the output of the furnace?"
	The deputy chief engineer of the company replied that the original design was 50 tons, it was changed to 70 tons the year before last, and now three-slot steel can reach 120 tons.
	Chairman Mao nodded with a smile after hearing this, and said repeatedly: "Good, good, good."

	At this time, more and more workers were present, and several were climbing on the cranes. Chairman Mao took a few steps, then stopped again, and repeatedly turned around to wave goodbye to these people who had created miracles in the Great Leap Forward. Chairman Mao's concern for production and the workers deeply moved everyone. At this time, applause rang out inside and outside the workshop, and cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" resounded everywhere. The young workers of the "Youth Furnace" in this workshop said: This furnace has been seen by Chairman Mao, we must fight a few more beautiful battles on this furnace. We will not only have three-slot steel, but also four-slot steel and five-slot steel in the future. The workers of this furnace created excellent results that day. The furnace of steel that the Chairman saw, after being smelted, was not only of grade A quality, but also the shortest smelting time of the day.

	At 5:40, Chairman Mao arrived at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory. This factory is also a vibrant factory in Chongqing. The workers here are enthusiastically carrying out the movement to oppose conservatism and innovate technology. Many workers have increased production efficiency by ten to dozens of times, and they can complete the equivalent of five years of work in just over a month to three months. These enthusiastic workers, knowing that Chairman Mao was coming to see them, had already run to the square in front of the office building to wait. When Chairman Mao appeared in front of them, many people were so happy and excited that they couldn't speak. Then, a burst of cheers erupted in the square: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Hello, Chairman Mao!" Two female typists and a female archivist thought that Chairman Mao might pass by their office, so they waited at the door. After a while, Chairman Mao walked up to the second floor. Just as they were about to greet him, Chairman Mao had already extended his hand, and they were so moved that they didn't know what to say. Hearing the cheers outside, Chairman Mao asked: "Where can I see everyone?" The two typists immediately said: "You can see clearly from our office." Chairman Mao walked into their office, then walked to the window, waving his hat to greet everyone. When going downstairs, he saw that there were big-character posters everywhere, and he happily asked:
	"Have you posted so many big-character posters?" The factory director replied: "We have posted more than 200,000 in a few days." Chairman Mao arrived at the stamping workshop. The workers here had already chosen the positions where they could see clearly and for the longest time. The workers lined up on both sides of the aisle, and the people behind stood on the machines and workbenches. Chairman Mao smiled and walked slowly through the lanes formed by the workers. Zeng Youpu, an old worker from the 24th workshop, knew from the usual photos that the Chairman would look at the work done by the workers when he went to the factory. He and several workers put the best and most proud products of the workshop in a turning place, guessing that the Chairman must see them. As the Chairman got closer, their hearts beat so fast that they almost jumped out. Chairman Mao did look carefully, and shook hands with the workers. There is a young milling worker in the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory named Liao Shigang. He has recently implemented the sixth leap forward plan. When making sewing machine positioning rod parts, he changed from milling with a milling machine to pressing with a friction press, increasing the two processes by more than a hundred times. The milling of the two end faces in the second process alone, which originally took eight hours to make 340 pieces, can now make 40,000 pieces in eight hours. Chairman Mao was very happy to learn about his deeds of leaping forward again and again. Chairman Mao met with workers from several workshops in the factory and did not leave until dusk.

	On March 28th, how many people couldn't sleep that night! Many leading cadres thought that Chairman Mao attached so much importance to industry, cared so much about the masses, and personally looked at how the workers produced and what big-character posters they wrote so deeply and meticulously, and they were more and more moved. They expressed that they must learn from Chairman Mao's great example, seriously study and delve into industrial knowledge and technical knowledge, and improve their leadership style. Many people regarded this day as the happiest day of their lives and recorded it in their diaries; but after the excitement, they felt ashamed, felt that they had many shortcomings and few achievements, and were sorry for Chairman Mao. The two typists who shook hands with Chairman Mao at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory both examined themselves and revised their plans that night, expressing that they must create achievements in ordinary work and never fail to live up to Chairman Mao's concern. One of the typists improved from typing 1,500 words per hour to 1,800 words the next day without a single missing word. The workers in the large rolling mill workshop and the large open-hearth furnace workshop of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company held group discussion meetings the next day, and almost everyone put forward their guarantees, deciding to "answer Chairman Mao with practical actions." The workers said: "Our leader loves the workers so much, and is connected to us by flesh and blood. We must make greater achievements to answer him."

    毛主席来到重庆的工厂
    ——本报驻重庆记者
    毛主席来到重庆了。3月28日下午，毛主席到了重庆钢铁公司和重庆建设机床厂。
    夜里下了一场雨，山城重庆到处绿油油的，更加美丽了。这天下午四点半钟，毛主席乘坐的一辆小汽车在重钢大轧钢车间的车场停住了。“毛主席来了！”“毛主席来了！”工人们都奔走相告，不一会坝子里、门口、路边，到处挤满了人。大家止不住心头的跳动。在这紧张、幸福的时刻，许多人简直不相信自己的眼睛是不是会看错。不，这完全是真的，毛主席就在我们面前。他慈祥地笑着点着头，拍着手，从人们的面前走过。大家清楚地看见毛主席穿着灰大衣，红光满面，身材魁梧，看来只像五十岁左右，比电影上和照片上看见的要年轻得多。工人们看见我们伟大的领袖这么健康，都认为这是全国六亿人民的最大幸福。大家真是兴奋极了，尽情地拍手欢呼：“毛主席，您好！”“毛主席万岁！”当场就有许多人高兴得涌出了热泪。
    毛主席来到轧钢车间。解放后我国第一根自己生产的钢轨，就是在这个车间轧制的。这里的两部轧钢机是六十年前张之洞从英国买来的。现在这两部老机器恢复了青春的光彩，正飞快地转动着，发出“哄哄”的吼声。1951年这两部轧钢机才轧三万多吨钢，今年可以达到三十五万吨以上。在车间入口处的钢板桥上，毛主席看了工人们用电焊烧的“十五年赶上英国”的标语。工人们为了每时每刻不忘记党中央和毛主席所提出的这个伟大任务，特地把这个口号用电焊烧在每天上、下班必须经过的钢板桥上，表示自己坚强的决心。毛主席走到钢板段，详细地问了钢板的生产情形，公司经理、工程师等一一作了回答。毛主席看见工人们劲头很大，一个个生龙活虎一般地在高温下操作，就一直走到轧板机的附近，在那里站了十来分钟，仔细地观看工人们的操作。通红的钢板从辊上滑下来，滚过他的身旁。毛主席笑着，向工人们点头，挥手招呼。工人们一面精神百倍地操作，一面欢呼：“毛主席，您好。”钢板段的工人们看到毛主席这样忙，却不辞劳苦地跑这样远来到自己的车间，都十分感动。过去他们每小时轧制钢板十八块到二十块，这天在毛主席鼓舞下，他们创造了每小时产二十四块钢板的最高纪录。
    毛主席在压平机旁看了一会，就来到轨钢段。这部马力机，张之洞买来后不多几年就被丢在一旁，抗日战争时期从汉阳搬到重庆，被抛在江边没人管，配件完全不见了。解放后，工人们把它收拾起来，配了上百吨、为数达三千多的零件。于是在1951年初轧制了钢轨。毛主席看了这匹马力机，这时辊槽里衔着一条条的钢胚，像火龙似的穿来穿去。毛主席问了这里生产些什么，多少种类，然后走到中剪机旁，站在开车台上仔细地看工人们把红红的钢胚一节一节地剪断。接着转过钢板整理场，来到冷剪机旁看工人们剪钢板。毛主席问了工人们剪钢板的情形。他对工人们的劳动产品一点一滴都这么感兴趣，看得这么仔细，问得这么具体；许多人激动地鼓起掌来。毛主席抬头看见了行车工人，就向这个工人招手致意；这个工人也在激动地注视着毛主席，向着自己最敬爱的领袖欢笑。
    毛主席从成品库房徐徐走上一段有七、八十公尺的斜坡，看到篾棚库房，就关切地问：“修这个竹房子做甚么的？”
    公司的党委书记回答说：“堆钢板的。”
    毛主席了解到钢板轧出后用人工抬上抬下，就问：“是不是可以搞些机械化运输？”
    在走到铁板桥时，毛主席看见两旁贴了很多大字报，就问：“大字报都贴在这里吗？这都是大字报吗？”他被一张题为“小脚女人”的大字报吸引住了，停下来，看了看，就问：
    “这是谁写的？”
    车间总支书记回答说：
    “是我写的。”
    毛主席笑着，又问：
    “这是说的谁？”
    这张大字报内容是批评大轧车间技术组工程师们的保守思想的，他们在讨论今年计划的时候，认为厂里提出向三十五万吨的目标前进没有根据，只能完成三十三万五千吨，现在事实证明今年完成三十五万吨没有问题。跟在主席旁边的一位工程师回答说：
    “这是批评我们技术组的一批知识分子在大跃进中不敢大胆迈步前进。”
    毛主席快出这个车间的大门口时，两个女学工迎面跑来，她们兴奋地每人握住主席的一只手。原来车间的工人怕每个人都争着去握手，这样主席会累。所以就委托这两个女学工做代表来表示他们对毛主席的敬意。毛主席连连回答说：“好，好，你们好！”
    从大轧钢车间到大平炉车间这段路的两旁，有好几千人等候着毛主席。毛主席见了，就走下车来，一再挥手向大家致意。
    在走进大平炉车间门口的时候，毛主席停下来看工人们写的大字报，工人们最近五天五夜写的三万六千张大字报都贴在这里，内容多数是批评陈规旧例和保守落后现象的。工人们看见毛主席看了自己写的大字报，特别高兴。许多工人原来就站在贴大字报篾席的后面，他们伸出头向毛主席笑着，向毛主席问好。
    大平炉车间的工人二十多天来，在生产上来了个“三级跳”——接连试制成功双包出钢、双槽出钢和三槽出钢，他们劲头大极了。毛主席被工人簇拥着走上平台。毛主席缓缓地走近第四号炉前，看进料的青年工人加莹石。小伙子们都把在毛主席面前劳动看做一生最大的幸福，谁不想显一显自己的本事呢？他们一边看着毛主席，一边拿着圆锹撮料往炉里抛，撮得那样多，抛得那样准，那样快。毛主席接连三次移近炉口，拿着蓝色眼镜仔细地往炉里看，问炉子多大，是什么式样的，要加些什么原料；在旁边的工程师都作了回答。
    接着毛主席问：“炉子产量多少？”
    公司的副总工程师回答说，原来设计五十吨，前年改为七十吨，现在三槽出钢可以达到一百二十吨。
    毛主席听了，点头微笑着，连声说：“好，好，好。”
    这时工人越来越多，好几个爬在吊车上。毛主席走了几步，又停下来，连续回身向这些在大跃进中创造奇迹的人们挥手告别。毛主席对生产和工人们的关心，使大家深受感动，这时车间内外，掌声雷动，到处欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”这个车间的“青年炉”的青年工人们说：这个炉子是毛主席看过的，我们一定要在这炉子上再打几个漂亮仗，我们不仅三槽出钢，以后还要四槽出钢，五槽出钢。这个炉子的工人们在当天就创造出了优良的成绩。主席看到的这一炉钢，炼成后，不仅质量是甲类，而且冶炼时间也是当天最短的一炉。
    五点四十分，毛主席到了重庆建设机床厂。这个厂也是重庆一个充满朝气的工厂。这里的工人正热火朝天地开展反保守、革新技术的运动。许多工人提高生产效率十几倍到几十倍，他们只要一个多月到三个月就可以完成相当于五年的工作量。这些热情的工人知道毛主席要来看他们的消息后，早就跑到办公大楼前的广场上等着。当毛主席出现在他们面前的时候，许多人欢喜、激动得说不出话。随后广场上爆发出一片欢呼声：毛主席万岁！”“毛主席，您好！”两个女打字员和一个女档案员想到毛主席可能从她们办公室前走过，便在门口等候。一会毛主席走上第二楼，她们正想迎上去时，毛主席已伸过手来，她们感动得不知说什么好。毛主席听到外面的欢呼声，就问：“找什么地方可以看到大家？”这两个打字员马上说：“到我们办公室可以看得清楚。”毛主席走进她们的办公室，然后走到窗口，挥着帽子向大家招呼。在下楼的时候，他看到这里那里，到处贴满大字报，就高兴地问：
    “你们贴了这么多大字报吗？”厂长回答说：“我们几天之内贴了二十几万张。”毛主席到了冲压车间。这里的工人早选择好了什么位子可以看得清楚，看得最久。工人们排在过道的两旁，后面的就站在机器上，钳台上。主席笑着，缓步走过工人们排成的巷道。二十四车间老工人曾右普从平时的照片上，知道主席到工厂都要看工人们做的活路，便和几个工人把车间最好、他们最得意的产品摆在一个转弯的地方，猜着主席一定要看的。当主席越走近的时候，他们心跳得简直要蹦出来了。毛主席果然仔细地看了，并和工人们握了手。重庆建设机床厂有个青年铣工，叫廖世刚，他在最近实现了第六次跃进计划，在作缝纫机定位杆零件时，把用铣床铣改为用摩擦压力机压，两道工序提高了一百多倍，仅铣第二次两端面工序，原八小时作三百四十件，现八小时可作四万件。毛主席知道了他跃进再跃进的事迹后，很高兴。毛主席和这个厂好几个车间的工人见了面，直到黄昏时才离去。
    3月28日，这天晚上多少人睡不着啊！许多领导干部想到毛主席这样重视工业，这样关心群众，这样深入、细致地亲自看工人们怎样生产、他们写了些什么大字报，越想越感动，表示一定要学毛主席伟大的榜样，认真学习钻研工业知识、技术知识，改进自己的领导作风。许多人都把这一天当成自己最幸福的一天，记在自己的日记上；但在兴奋之后都感到惭愧，感到自己缺点多，成绩少，对不起毛主席。重庆建设机床厂和毛主席握过手的两个打字员，都检查了自己，当晚修订了规划，表示一定要在平凡的工作中创造成绩，决不辜负毛主席的关怀。其中一个打字员第二天就从过去每小时打一千五百字提高到一千八百字，没有一个漏字。重庆钢铁公司大轧车间和大平炉车间的工人，第二天就分组召开了座谈会，几乎每个人都提出了自己的保证，决定要“以实际行动来回答毛主席”。工人们说：“我们的领袖这样爱护工人，和我们血肉相连，我们一定要做出更大的成绩来回答他。”
