Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th. A batch of precious cultural relics has recently been unearthed in Shanxi Province with the discovery of Warring States tombs, Tang Dynasty tombs, and Ming Dynasty tombs.

　　A Warring States period tomb discovered in Miaoqian Village, Wanrong County, was revealed by the scouring of the Yellow River. This rectangular vertical pit tomb is seven meters long and five meters fifty wide. The outer and inner coffins have decayed. Inside the tomb are more than thirty items, including a horseshoe-shaped bronze tripod and the ancient musical instrument chimes, most of which are still intact.

There were also lifelike pottery figures of civil officials, military officers, and dancers.

　　A Ming Dynasty tomb discovered at a basic construction site in the western suburbs of Taiyuan City has attracted people's interest with its dazzling array of colorful murals. This octagonal stone tomb has magnificent interior construction. The tomb walls have two layers of colored paintings depicting the tomb owner and attendants enjoying themselves, the band playing flutes and drums, dancers dancing, and guests presenting gifts, representing the life of the aristocracy.
