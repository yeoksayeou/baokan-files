    Two Points of Hope
    The short commentaries published in People's Daily on pages 2, 3, and 4, which are combined with certain reports, are very good. Some of these articles implement dialectics and use the actual events reported to explain principles, making it easy for readers to understand and understand more deeply. This propaganda method of combining theory and practice not only plays a role in guiding practical work but also achieves the effect of theoretical education. I very much hope that some philosophers and those engaged in theoretical work will also write more articles of this kind.
    In addition, I hope that People's Daily can report on the good experiences of universities in training worker-peasant cadres. Because how to train worker-peasant cadres well is one of the prominent problems that commonly exists in universities. Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology Li Song

    两点希望
    人民日报二、三、四版登的一些结合某篇报道的短评很好。这些文章，有的贯彻了辩证法，运用报道的实际事情来讲道理，很容易使读者理解，而且理解得更深刻。这种理论和实际相结合的宣传方法，不仅会起到指导实际工作的作用，也收到了理论教育的作用。我很希望一些哲学家和做理论工作的也多写点这类文章。
    此外，希望人民日报能报道些高等学校中培养工农干部的好经验。因为怎样很好地培养工农干部，是高等学校普遍存在的突出问题之一。　北京钢铁学院　李崧
