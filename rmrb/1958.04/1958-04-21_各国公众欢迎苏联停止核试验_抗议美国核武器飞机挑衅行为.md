Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The movement demanding peaceful negotiations and opposing the continued nuclear testing by the US and British governments continues to grow. An increasing number of government leaders and people's organizations are welcoming the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear testing and protesting the provocative actions of US nuclear weapons aircraft.

Mongolian People's Republic's Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, in his letter to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev, expressed warm support for the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease testing nuclear weapons. On the 14th, Swedish Prime Minister Tage Erlander, in his reply to Khrushchev, also mentioned that the Swedish government had studied the Soviet decision to cease nuclear testing with satisfaction.

Five peace activists from the American "Non-Violent Action Against Nuclear Weapons" organization, led by Pastor Lawrence Scott, arrived in London on the 16th and went to the British Prime Minister's residence on the 18th to call on Britain to abandon its nuclear armament policy.

The Bulgarian Academy of Sciences held a meeting on the 18th and adopted a letter to the academies of sciences and scientific workers of the world, firmly supporting the Soviet Union's new initiative and calling on scientific workers around the world to fight for world peace.

Lebanese prominent social figure and former parliamentarian Abdallah Hage sent a letter to the Soviet Ambassador to Lebanon regarding the Soviet Union's cessation of nuclear testing, stating, "Please allow me to express, on behalf of my compatriots, thanks and gratitude for the Soviet Supreme Soviet's great humanitarian initiative to unilaterally decide to cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons."

Amidst the rising tide of the peace movement, the United States government is directing American aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs to conduct provocations towards the Soviet border. This act of playing with fire has not only been severely protested by the Soviet government but also condemned by peace-loving countries.

On the 19th, all newspapers in Cairo carried headlines reporting the Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's statement of protest. "Al-Shaab" condemned the actions of the American military authorities, calling on the people and governments of all countries to take all measures to stop this dangerous game that threatens the peaceful existence of mankind.

The British "News Chronicle" wrote, "Gromyko's protest is inevitable. Ten days ago, the U.S. Strategic Air Command admitted that, due to false images appearing on radar screens, it had sent aircraft carrying bombs to fly towards the Soviet border." The newspaper emphasized that the actions of the U.S. Air Force could be an "international provocation."

The Canadian "Financial Post," in its editorial on the 19th, expressed unease about the provocative actions of American aircraft carrying nuclear bombs. It wrote, "Look at how our security hangs by such a thin thread."

However, the U.S. government is trying to deny the U.S. aircraft's provocative crimes, attempting to deceive public opinion in the United States and other countries. But their explanations are full of loopholes. U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Snyder insisted that the Soviet protest was not in accordance with the facts, yet he admitted that the Associated Press report cited by Gromyko had been reviewed by the Department of Defense, and this report "accurately" described the existing operating system of the U.S. Strategic Air Command. The official statement issued by the U.S. Air Force stated that, according to the U.S. Strategic Air Command's operating system, a portion of the strategic units under the command of the Strategic Air Command are in a state of readiness for combat, and these combat units can take off immediately within fifteen minutes after an alert is announced. However, the statement said that the aircraft of these operational units will not continue to fly beyond the predetermined defense line until they receive further instructions.

However, the U.S. Air Force spokesman refused to indicate where this defense line was when answering questions from reporters. He also refused to answer the question of whether this defense line was near the Soviet border.

The State Department in a statement "categorically denied" that the U.S. Air Force was "conducting provocative flights over the Arctic region and near the Soviet Union." However, the statement does not deny the flight itself but only "explains" that these aircraft will only take combat actions under the direct command of the U.S. President.

    各国公众欢迎苏联停止核试验
    抗议美国核武器飞机挑衅行为
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：要求和平谈判、反对美英政府继续核试验的运动继续增长。越来越多的政府领导人和人民团体欢迎苏联单方面停止核试验的决定，并抗议美国核武器飞机的挑衅行为。
    蒙古人民共和国部长会议主席泽登巴尔在他写给苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫的信中，热烈支持苏联单方面停止试验核武器的决定。14日，瑞典首相塔·埃兰德在给赫鲁晓夫的复信中，也谈到了瑞典政府满意地研究了苏联停止核试验的决定。
    以牧师劳伦斯·斯科特为首的美国“非暴力反对核武器和平组织”的五个和平人士在16日到达伦敦，18日前往英国首相官邸，呼吁英国放弃核军备政策。
    保加利亚科学院曾于18日开会通过了告全世界科学院和科学工作者书，坚决支持苏联的新倡议，呼吁全世界科学工作者为世界和平而斗争。
    黎巴嫩著名社会人士、前议员阿卜杜拉·哈吉就苏联停止核试验给苏联驻黎巴嫩大使一封信，信中说，“请允许我代表我国同胞对苏联最高苏维埃单方面决定停止试验原子武器和氢武器的伟大人道倡议表示感谢和感激”。
    在和平运动日益高涨的情况下，美国政府却指使载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机向苏边境进行挑衅。这种玩火行为不仅受到苏联政府的严重抗议，而且也遭到了爱好和平国家的谴责。
    19日，开罗各报都用大字标题报道了苏联外长葛罗米柯的抗议声明。“人民报”谴责美国军事当局的这种行动，呼吁世界各国人民和政府采取一切措施，来制止这种威胁人类和平生存的危险把戏。
    英国“新闻纪事报”写道，“葛罗米柯的抗议是必然的。十天前美国战略空军司令部还承认，由于雷达装置银幕上出现假影，曾派出载有炸弹的飞机向苏联边境飞行”。报纸强调指出，美国空军的行动可能是“国际挑衅”。
    加拿大“财政邮报”在19日的社论中对载有核弹的美国飞机的挑衅行动表示不安。它写道，“看看我们的安全系在一根多么细的线上啊。”
    但是，美国官方却力图否认美机挑衅罪行，企图迷惑美国和各国的舆论。但是他们的解释却破绽百出。美国国防部新闻发言人斯奈德硬说苏联的抗议是不符合事实的，然而他又承认葛罗米柯所援引的合众社消息经国防部审查过，这个消息“准确地”描写了美国战略空军现有的作战体系。美国空军官方所发表的声明说，根据美国战略空军的作战体系，受战略空军司令部指挥的一部分战略单位处于随时准备作战的状态，这些战斗单位，在宣布警报之后十五分钟可以马上起飞。但是，声明说，这些作战单位的飞机在它们没有接到下一步的指示前，不会继续飞行越过预定的防线。
    然而，美国空军发言人在回答记者的问题时拒绝指出这种防线在那里。他还拒绝回答这样的问题：这个防线是否在苏联边境附近。
    国务院在声明里“断然否认”美国空军“在北极地区上空和苏联附近作挑衅性的飞行”。但是，声明并不否认飞行这件事，而只限于“解释”这些飞机只有在美国总统的直接命令下才会采取作战行动。
