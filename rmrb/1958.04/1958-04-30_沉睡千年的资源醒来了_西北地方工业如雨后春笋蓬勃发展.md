Resources Sleeping for Thousands of Years Awaken
Local Industries in Northwest China Spring Up Like Bamboo Shoots

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, April 29th) Local industries in the Northwest region are flourishing vigorously like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Incomplete statistics from most counties in Shaanxi Province show that more than 2,100 small factories and mines have been established so far. By the end of March, Gansu Province had built more than 1,300 various small factories and mines. The first small hydropower station, converted from a water mill, has shone its light in the rural areas of the Qinghai Plateau for the first time.

Since the central government called for vigorously developing local industries, the Northwest region has shown great enthusiasm for building local industries. This year, the total investment in local industries in various regions has reached more than 154 million yuan, an increase of nearly 90% compared to last year, which is equivalent to 63% of the investment in local industries during the First Five-Year Plan period. Among the factories and mines planned to be built in the Northwest region this year, there are more than 270 larger factories and mines to be built by the provinces and autonomous regions. These include steel plants, power machinery and electrical machinery plants, power plants, coal mines, synthetic petroleum plants, and cement plants; as well as chemical industrial plants for fertilizers, electrolysis, dyes, sulfuric acid, plastics, and glass; and light industrial factories to meet the needs of the people's lives. Most of these factories and mines will be put into production this year. It is estimated that the total output value of local industries in the Northwest regions this year will reach more than 1.64 billion yuan, an increase of more than 70% compared to last year.

In the upsurge of the whole people running industry, the rich resources in the Northwest region that have been sleeping for thousands of years have been awakened. In the Qinling Mountains, Bashan Mountains, Qilian Mountains, Helan Mountains, as well as the Kunlun Mountains, Altai Mountains and Tianshan Mountains, various new resources are constantly being discovered. Shaanxi's oil shale, southern Shaanxi's molybdenum mine, and Qinghai's boron mine are all ranked first in terms of reserves in our country. Qinghai Province originally wanted to build a sack factory, using the tens of thousands of acres of wild hemp that had been discovered, but worried that there would not be enough raw materials. Recently, in the upsurge of developing local industries, according to reports from various places, it is everywhere in the province. Huangzhong County in this province is known as a county without coal. Gao Zilong, the deputy county magistrate, personally led the masses to the mountains for exploration. Based on the ground conditions, they judged that after digging eight meters deep, they found coal. Within a short period of time, the county discovered ten coal mines and other minerals, and seven small coal mines have now been established.

    沉睡千年的资源醒来了
    西北地方工业如雨后春笋蓬勃发展
    本报西安29日电　西北地区的地方工业，正如雨后春笋般蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。陕西省大部分县的不完全统计，到目前已办起二千一百多个小厂矿。甘肃省到3月底统计，已建成各种小型厂矿一千三百多个。第一座用水磨改装的小型水电站，已在青海高原的农村首次放出了光芒。
    自从中央号召大力发展地方工业后，西北地区建设地方工业的劲头很大。今年，各地地方工业投资总共达一亿五千四百多万元，比去年增加近90％，等于第一个五年计划期间地方工业投资的63％。西北地区今年计划兴建的厂矿中，属于省和自治区建设的较大厂矿共有二百七十多个。其中有炼钢厂、动力机械和电机厂、发电厂、煤矿、人造石油厂和水泥厂；还有化肥、电解、染料、硫酸、塑料、玻璃等化学工业厂以及为满足人民生活需要的轻工业工厂。这些厂矿大部分都要在今年投入生产。预计今年西北各地地方工业总产值共将达十六亿四千多万元，比去年要增长70％以上。
    在全民办工业高潮里，西北地区沉睡了千万年的丰富资源被唤醒了。秦岭、巴山、祁连山、贺兰山以及昆仑山和阿尔泰山、天山，各种新的资源不断被发现。陕西的油母页岩、陕南的钼矿、青海的硼矿、其储量在我国都居第一位。青海省原想建设一座麻袋厂，利用已发现的几万亩野生浪麻，但耽心原料不够，最近在发展地方工业高潮中，据各地报告，全省遍地皆是。这个省的湟中县号称无煤县。副县长高子龙亲自带领群众上山勘探，根据地面情况判断，挖了八公尺深，就挖出煤来，短期内全县就发现十处煤矿和其他矿产，现已办起了七座小煤矿。
