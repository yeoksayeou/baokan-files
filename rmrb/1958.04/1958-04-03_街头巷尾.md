Streets and Alleys

Better Than Her Own Daughter

After Zhou Shunlan, a cadre from the Ministry of Education, was transferred to the Victory Cooperative in Shilihe Township, Yingshan County, Hubei Province, she settled down in the home of a 71-year-old man.

On the afternoon of February 26th, the rain was heavy, and the cooperative members were not working in the fields. After lunch, the old man picked up a pair of cotton pants full of holes to mend. When Comrade Zhou Shunlan saw this, she offered to mend the pants for him. The old man refused, saying, "I can mend them myself." Zhou Shunlan insisted repeatedly, and the old man had no choice but to hand over the pants.

Zhou Shunlan spent the entire afternoon mending the pants, but only finished half of them. After dinner, she lit an oil lamp and continued to sew. By ten o'clock, she had mended all fifteen holes, large and small. The stitches were dense, the patches were neat, and they were both strong and beautiful. By this time, the old man was fast asleep, so she quietly placed the pants next to his pillow.

The next day, the old man put on the mended pants, his eyes filled with tears of gratitude. Whenever he met someone he knew, he would excitedly grab them, pointing at the patches with a beaming smile, and say, "Look! These were mended for me by a comrade from Beijing. It’s even better than if my own daughter did it!" (Transmitted by Chuanyin)

Everyone a Shovel

When guests enter the various teaching and research offices and offices of our college, they all have a sense of novelty: whether they are ordinary cadres or leading cadres, whether they are new teachers or old teachers, everyone has a tool for labor—a shovel. The shovels of the three secretaries of the Party Committee and the various ministers of the Party Committee are polished brightly and placed on their desks. Professor Li Zonghai of the Mechanical Engineering Department said after buying a shovel, "Everyone having a shovel is like everyone having a pen. It will be convenient to work in the future. Just say 'labor' and pick it up and go." Associate Professor Sun Jingqing said, "If we are to be intellectual workers of the working class, we must regularly participate in physical labor. How can we do that without tools?"

Now, as soon as our college's labor headquarters announces that snow removal or earth digging is needed, all the teachers immediately bring their own tools and head to the site.

    街头巷尾
    比女儿还好
    教育部的干部周顺兰下放到湖北省应山县十里河乡胜利社以后，安家落户在一位七十一岁的老爷爷家里。
    2月26日下午，雨势很大，社员们都没出工。老爷爷吃过中饭，拿起他的一条满是窟窿的棉裤缝补，周顺兰同志看见了，就要替老爷爷补棉裤。老爷爷不肯，说：“我能补。”周顺兰再三请求，老爷爷见推让不过去，只好把棉裤交给了她。
    周顺兰手不离针地补了一下午，只补好了一半；吃了晚饭，点上油灯，继续缝补。十点多钟，她把大大小小十五个窟窿全补好了。针眼儿密密麻麻，补钉儿整整齐齐，又结实，又好看。这时，老爷爷睡熟了，她轻悄悄把棉裤放在老爷爷枕头边。
    第二天，老爷爷穿上补好的棉裤，感激得流下眼泪。遇见熟人，他就像报喜一样，拉着人家不放，边指补钉边笑眯眯地讲：“看！这是北京来的同志给我补的，比我女儿还好哩！”（传音）
    每人一把锹
    当客人们走进了我们学院各教研室、办公室后，都有一种新奇的感觉：不论一般干部，还是领导干部，不论是新教师，还是老教师，每人都有一件劳动工具——铁锹。党委的三位书记和党委的各位部长的铁锹擦得泽亮，放在办公的案头。机械系李宗海教授买到了一把锹之后说：“每人有把锹，和每人有支笔一样，以后干活就方便了，只要说声劳动，拿起就走。”孙镜清副教授说：“我们做个工人阶级知识分子，要经常参加体力劳动，没有工具那行呢？”
    现在我们学院劳动指挥部只要通知一下说，要进行扫雪或者刨土等劳动了，所有的教师都立即自带着工具，奔向现场。
