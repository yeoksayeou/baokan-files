Answer to Readers:

    To where can one adopt an infant? Comrades Wang Sanhuo and Liu Sini of the Nanma Village Agricultural Cooperative in Zanhuang County, Hebei Province:

    You wrote to us saying that you would like to adopt an infant from a government-run nursery or children's home. We immediately inquired with the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau. They replied that the Beijing Children's Home Nursery Department does not currently have any infants, but the Wuxi Infant and Young Children's Home in Jiangsu Province does have infants available for adoption. After we wrote to inquire with the Wuxi Infant and Young Children's Home, they replied that they currently have many infants, mostly girls, with the oldest being around ten months old. The procedures and requirements for adopting an infant are very simple, only requiring a letter from the local government or organization proving that the adoptive parents have the ability to raise the child and are free from infectious diseases. Adoption is possible, and no fees are charged other than bringing the infant's clothes.

    The address of the institution is No. 1 Xinmiaoqian, Jiefang East Road, Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province.

    The two photos on the right show the living conditions of infants at the Wuxi Infant and Young Children's Home, taken by Comrade Ren Zhenbei of the Wuxi Daily at the request of this newspaper.

    到哪里领养婴儿？河北赞皇县南马村农业社王三货、刘四妮同志：
    你们来信说，想到政府主办的育婴机关或儿童教养院领养一个婴儿。我们当即询问北京市民政局。他们答复说，北京市儿童教养院育婴部暂时没有婴儿，而江苏省无锡市婴幼院还有婴儿，可以领养。经我们向无锡市婴幼院去信询问，他们回信说，他们那里现有不少婴儿，大都是女的，最大的有十个月左右。领养婴儿的手续和条件很简单，只要持有当地政府或机关的信件，证明领养人有抚养能力，无传染病，即可以领养而且除自带婴儿衣服外，不收任何费用。
    该院的地址在江苏省无锡市解放东路新庙前一号。
    右边这两张照片就是无锡市婴幼院婴儿生活的情况，是本报委托无锡日报任镇北同志拍摄的。
