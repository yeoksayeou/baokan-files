Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th: In the United States, where racial discrimination is rampant, colored laborers are the first to suffer from the economic crisis. Their unemployment rate is more than double that of white workers.

According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau's report, out of 7,200,900 colored laborers in the United States in March, 1,035,000 were unemployed; that is, one out of every seven people was unemployed. Among the 60,301,000 white workers, 4,163,000 were unemployed, or one out of every fifteen people.

In addition, young workers are also the first to be hit by the wave of unemployment. Currently, among young workers under the age of 24, one out of every seven is unemployed.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 10th: As major U.S. companies cut advertising expenses amidst the economic crisis, the American newspaper and magazine industry, which relies heavily on advertising revenue, is also suffering.

According to the "Wall Street Journal," five of New York City's seven newspapers saw a decrease in advertising in January compared to a year ago. Recruitment advertisements in "The New York Times" decreased by 42%, and total advertising decreased by 5%.

Major magazines such as "Life," "Time," "Look," "Ladies' Home Journal," and "Better Homes and Gardens" saw advertising space decrease by 12% to 25% in January compared to the same month last year.

The "Wall Street Journal" also reported that major magazines have recently been competing to attract subscribers by offering discounts, sometimes as low as 40%. This approach is not only an attempt to compensate for the decrease in advertising revenue by increasing subscription revenue, but also an indirect method of increasing advertising revenue, as the size of advertising fees is also calculated based on the magazine's circulation.

    有色人工人首先遭害大批失业
    报纸杂志业跟着倒霉广告费大减
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：在种族歧视风气盛行的美国，受到经济危机之害的首先是有色人工人。他们失业的比例比白种工人高出一倍以上。
    根据美国国情普查局的报告里的资料，3月份在美国七百二十万零九千个有色人工人中，就有一百零三万五千人失业；这就是说，每七人中就有一人失业。而六千零三十万一千个白种工人中有四百一十六万三千人失业，即每十五人中有一人失业。
    另外，青年工人也首先受到失业浪潮的冲击。目前在二十四岁以下的年轻工人中，每七人就有一人失业。
    新华社10日讯　纽约消息：由于美国各大公司在经济危机中纷纷削减广告经费，以广告收入为主要收入的美国报纸杂志业也就随着遭殃。
    据“华尔街日报”报道，纽约市七家报纸中有五家1月份的广告都比一年前减少了。“纽约时报”上征聘人员的广告减少了42％，全部广告减少5％。
    各大杂志如“生活”、“时代”、“展望”、“妇女家庭杂志”、“家政”等1月份广告版面比去年同月减少12％到25％。
    “华尔街日报”还报道，各大杂志最近都竞相用打折扣的办法来诱惑订户，折扣甚至低到四折。这种做法不仅是企图用订费收入的增加弥补广告收入的减少，而且也是增加广告收入的间接手法，因为广告费的大小也是根据杂志的销数多少来计算的。
