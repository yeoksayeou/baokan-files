    Recently, I visited the coastal defense troops and the people along the coast in the Fujian front. They told me many touching stories about the coastal defense soldiers in safeguarding the socialist construction of the motherland.

      Brave Artillerymen
    Artillery battles often occur in the Xiamen area. Not long ago, several cargo ships carrying building materials were sailing to Xiamen Port. The Chiang Kai-shek army artillery entrenched on Kinmen Island opened fire on the cargo ships. The Third Company of a certain artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xiamen immediately returned fire fiercely. The fierce battle crushed the enemy's artillery positions, and the cargo ships safely entered Xiamen Port. Early the next morning, the enemy blindly carried out retaliatory bombardment of our forward positions. Our Third Artillery Company was ordered to suppress the enemy's fire, thus attracting the firepower of four enemy artillery companies. All the officers and soldiers of the heroic Third Company calmly engaged in combat. "Five rounds of rapid fire, fire!" Second Platoon Leader Li Yuncai's clear command was transmitted to the gunners of the Second Platoon. Soon, just as the commander ordered "pause," when Li Yuncai directed all his comrades to conceal themselves, an enemy shell exploded beside him, and the splashing stones hit his right eye. He didn't want others to know that he was injured, and he used his left hand to cover his right eye, which was bleeding profusely, and continued to record the company commander's combat orders. When his comrades discovered that he had been injured and advised him to leave the position, he said, "My left eye is still good and I can continue to fight." It was not until the instructor gave the order that he left his fighting post. By this time, the severe pain had made him unconscious. When he returned to the unit from the hospital, he still stood firm at the battle post of defending the construction of the motherland. An artillery officer told me that there were not just one but thousands of soldiers like this, loyal to the motherland, on the coastal defense line.

    An artillery officer told me that in the past seven months, the Chiang Kai-shek army artillery on Greater and Lesser Kinmen Islands had fired more than 500 times at merchant ships, fishing boats, and rural areas, using nearly 20,000 shells. However, they never gained an advantage. Each time, under the counterattack of our powerful People's Artillery, they were beaten black and blue. Once, when the Kinmen Chiang Kai-shek army artillery fired at a village on our coast, the artillerymen guarding the coast immediately bombarded the enemy. Within a few tens of minutes, they destroyed the enemy's howitzers, destroyed the enemy's observation posts, destroyed more than 100 enemy houses, and killed and wounded more than 50 Chiang Kai-shek army officers and soldiers. At this time, these Chiang Kai-shek troops, who specialized in destroying the motherland's people's production and construction, shrank back into the isolated islands and dared not move rashly.

      Sea Cavalry
    In the People's Liberation Army troops on the Fujian front, there is a resourceful, flexible, brave and good-at-fighting sea cavalry. Regardless of summer or winter, day or night, they always protect the transport convoys and fishermen coming and going at sea. They have fought many battles at sea with enemy ships and gunboats, and the number of times they have fought with enemy planes is even more countless. Sometimes there are five or six battles in one day.

    When the Yingxia Railway was under construction and a large number of building materials were transported from the sea to Fujian, this People's Navy艇 team was particularly diligent. As soon as it got dark, the sailors drove brisk gunboats to intercept enemy ships on the waterways where the enemy often出没, so that the transport convoy could travel safely on our own waterways. As soon as it dawned, the sailors had to meet the air defense operations. After a night of hard work, they could only sleep next to the gun position on the deck during the day. In the summer, the southern sun baked the deck like a branding iron. How could you sleep? The sailors told me: "Although we can't sleep well, everyone's spirit is exceptionally full." Why is this? I got the answer in a sailor's conversation. A sailor from Shandong said: "Every time I go to sea to escort, I always think that I have a great responsibility. How do the people in the rear expect and trust me to protect them to carry out construction with peace of mind!" "Yes, when I think of the rapid changes in my hometown, I have endless energy for fighting and working," another sailor added. Because of this, the sailors not only overcame the difficulties in life, but also showed unparalleled bravery and tenacity in battle.

    When I visited a gunboat that had just returned from a sea patrol, I found dozens of small patches on the deck and the side of the boat. Gu Benliang, the captain of a certain unit of the Navy, said: This was scratched by enemy planes' bullets and shrapnel during combat. Such small holes don't matter to the gunboat. It is still speeding through the Taiwan Strait, striking enemy ships. This battle-tested 艇 team sometimes captures large Chiang Kai-shek navy junks carrying US-Chiang agents, sometimes the sailors drive this brisk little gunboat to ambush enemy ships in the Penghu Strait, and sometimes they停 in the vicinity of enemy islands to bombard the Chiang Kai-shek army.

    The sailors' heroic deeds have also left a deep impression in the hearts of the coastal people. A渡駁 boatman told me a story of a battle he witnessed. He said that because the sailors protected a large number of merchant convoys and safely transported goods in and out, the pirates could not rob them, so they tried their best to destroy our gunboats. One day, when the sailors had completed their escort mission and were resting during the day, the Chiang Kai-shek group sent ten jet fighters to the harbor to sneak attack three boats 停. When the enemy plane was about to approach the air, the sailors immediately drove the gunboat to meet the enemy plane. The anti-aircraft fire on the boat fiercely shot at the flying贼, and at the same time, they engaged in a hide-and-seek-like irregular rapid航行 at sea with the enemy plane. Ten enemy planes interspersed and repeatedly扫射 and bombed the gunboat, dropping more than 30 bombs. The battle lasted for more than 50 minutes. Although several sailors were injured and heroically sacrificed, the clever gunboat still proudly游动 on the sea. The sailors continued to stubbornly bombard the enemy planes until the enemy planes' bombs and bullets were exhausted, and the enemy planes were shot down and wounded by the small gunboat. When the rest fled in a狼狈, the sailors drove the gunboat into the port to rest.

  Hardworking Coastal Sentries
    People who have been to the Fujian front deeply feel that now that the Chiang Kai-shek army is entrenched in Taiwan and Kinmen and Matsu, and US imperialism often唆使 and directs the Chiang Kai-shek army to destroy the socialist construction of the motherland, how difficult it is to guard this long coastline of Fujian! The coastal defense soldiers have to pay a lot of hard work. On the sandy beaches of the coast, on the rocks by the sea, and in the deep mountains傍海, there are footprints of coastal sentries.

    Recently, I visited an island on the coastal defense front line. On the top of a mountain several hundred meters above sea level, there is a矮矮 bunker, in which three young lookout sentries live. Typhoons of level six or seven or above often blow from the sea to the mountain, and flying sand and rocks make it impossible for trees and weeds to grow on the mountain. Each time the rice sent to the sentries from the foot of the mountain was also cooled by the sea breeze. One weekend night, I arrived at this mountain. At this time, the people in the rear were singing and dancing lightly, and beautiful symphonies were響 in the noisy streets, but on this mountain, only the roar of the sea waves冲击 the rocks, the sound of the sea breeze掀起 small pebbles沙沙, and the vast sea embraced the sleeping earth. Walking into the bunker, only the horseshoe watch made a ticking sound. In this way, a sentry, holding a gun and wearing a望远镜, observes the sea and the sky day and night all year round. I asked a sentry who had just left his post to talk about his feelings here. He said: "Perhaps some people feel that such a life is lonely and monotonous, but we sentries feel that it is very rich, because we know what kind of significance this has for the motherland."

    Every time in the dark night with cloudy weather, wind and rain, the coastal patrolmen quietly walk past the fishing villages, and carry out機警 searches on the beaches and in the valleys, braving the wind and rain and flying sand. One winter night, when I followed them to perform their duties, I saw a young and strong patrolman. Although his clothes were soaked from翻山越岭, he had to carefully check every ditch and hole in the mountains and rocks he passed. He also had to think about a footprint on the beach. When this twenty-two-year-old young warrior潛伏 behind a seaside rock, he gently told me about the tide涨落 situation and the places where the enemy could easily land. He was so familiar with the sea and land in this area. He could tell with his eyes closed how many reefs there were in the sea in front of him, when the tide would rise to what place, and增添 a small tree or多 out a pile of soil on the beach and丘陵地 could not hide from his eyes. He said with firm confidence: Catch one enemy if he comes, and not half of them will escape. At dawn, I returned from the field with the patrolmen. On the coast where the coastal patrolmen were驻, we watched一批又一批 of fishing boats sail away from the seaside, spread their nets迎 the rising sun, and watched the farmers扛着 farm tools and the students背着 schoolbags walk to the fields and schools. At this time, the warriors who had worked hard all night were so excited that they did not sleep. The patrolmen said: "This is our happiest moment."

    在祖国的海防线上
    新华社记者　程鹏
    最近，我在福建前线访问了海防部队和沿海的人民，他们告诉我许多有关海防战士在保卫祖国社会主义建设中的动人事迹。
      英勇的炮兵
    在厦门地区经常发生炮战。不久前，有几只货轮载着建筑材料往厦门港驶来，盘踞在金门岛上的蒋军炮兵开炮向货轮射击，驻在厦门某地的人民解放军炮兵某部三连立即猛烈还击敌人。激烈的战斗把敌人炮兵阵地摧垮了，货轮安全驶进厦门港。第二天清早，敌人就向我前沿地带盲目地进行报复性的轰击，我炮兵三连奉命压制敌人的炮火，这样便把敌人四个炮兵连的火力吸引过来。英勇的三连全体官兵都沉着地进行战斗。“五发急速射，放！”二炮长李运才清晰的口令传给二班的炮手们。不久，正当指挥员命令“暂停”，李运才指挥全班同志隐蔽的时候，敌人一发炮弹落在他的身边爆炸了，迸起的石块正击中他的右眼。他不愿让别人知道是负伤了，用左手捂住被打得鲜血直流的右眼，继续纪录着连长的战斗命令。当他的战友们发现他已负伤，劝他下阵地的时候，他说：“我的左眼还是好的，能继续战斗。”直到指导员下命令后，他才离开了战斗岗位，这时，剧痛已使他昏迷过去。当他从医院里返回部队后，仍然坚守在保卫祖国建设的战斗岗位上。一位炮兵负责人对我说，像这样忠于祖国的战士在海防线上不是一个人，而有千千万万。
    一位炮兵军官告诉我，在去年七个月中，大、小金门岛上的蒋军炮兵向商船、渔船和农村打炮五百多次，用了近二万发炮弹，但是，他们总也没有占到便宜，每次都是在我强大的人民炮兵还击下，被打得焦头烂额。有一次，金门蒋军炮兵向我海岸某村庄射击时，守卫在海岸上的炮兵们马上轰击敌人，在几十分钟内把敌人的榴弹炮打坏了，摧毁了敌人的观察所，打倒敌人房子一百多间，打死打伤蒋军官兵五十多人。这时，这些专事破坏祖国人民生产建设的蒋军才死寂地龟缩在孤岛上不敢乱动。
      海上轻骑
    在福建前线人民解放军部队，有一支机智灵活英勇善战的海上轻骑，他们不分夏季还是冬季，无论是白天还是夜晚，总是在海上保护南来北往的运输船队和渔民生产。他们在海上和敌人的舰艇、炮船打过很多次仗，和敌人飞机搏斗的次数更多得难以计算，有时一天中就有五、六次战斗。
    当鹰厦铁路正在兴建，大批建筑材料从海上运来福建的时候，这支人民海军艇队就格外地辛勤。天一黑，水兵们就驾着轻快的炮艇在敌人经常出没的航道上阻击敌人舰艇，让运输船队在我们自己的航道上安全行进。天一亮，水兵们又要迎接对空作战，一夜辛劳后，白天也只能睡在甲板上的炮位旁休息。夏天，南方的烈日把甲板晒得像烙铁一样，那能睡得着啊？水兵们告诉我：“虽然睡不好觉，但是每个人的精神都异常充沛。”这是为什么呢？在一次水兵们的对话中我得到了解答。一个山东籍的水兵说：“我每次出海护航时，总想到自己责任重大，在后方的人们是怎样期望和信任我保卫他们安心的进行建设！”“是的，我一想到家乡一日千里的变化，战斗和工作的劲头就没完没了。”另一个水兵接着说。就是因为这样，水兵们不仅克服了生活上的困难，他们在战斗中也表现出无比的英勇顽强。
    我到一只刚从海上巡逻回来不久的炮艇上访问的时候，发现艇的甲板和艇身旁有几十个小补钉，海军某部中队长顾本良中尉说：这是在战斗时被敌机的子弹和炸弹片擦伤的，这样的小窟窿对炮艇来说是不碍事的。它仍然在台湾海峡中飞驰着，打击着敌人的舰艇。这支久经战斗的艇队，有时把一百多吨的装着美蒋特务的蒋帮海军大型机帆船连人带船抓来，有时水兵们驾着这个轻快的小炮艇，到澎湖海峡中伏击敌舰，有时停在敌岛附近炮击蒋军。
    水兵们的英勇事迹，在沿海人民的心中也留下了深刻的印象。一个渡驳船夫给我讲了他亲眼见到的一次战斗故事。他说，因为水兵们保护着大批商船队安全地把货物运进运出，海盗们抢劫不到，便想尽办法来破坏我们的炮艇。有一天，当水兵们完成护航任务，白天在休息的时候，蒋介石集团派了十架喷气式战斗机到港湾里来偷袭停泊的三只船艇。在敌机将要临空的时候，水兵们立即驾着炮艇向敌机迎去，艇上的高射炮火一面猛烈向飞贼射击，一面在海上和敌机展开了捉迷藏似的不规则的快速航行。十架敌机穿插着返复地向炮艇扫射轰炸，扔下三十多枚炸弹，战斗持续了五十多分钟，虽然有几个水兵负伤和壮烈牺牲了，但是机灵的炮艇仍然高傲地在海上游动，水兵们继续顽强轰击敌机，直到敌机的炸弹、子弹打完了，并且被小炮艇击落击伤敌机二架，其余的狼狈逃跑的时候，水兵们才把炮艇开进港内休息。
  辛勤的海岸哨兵
    到过福建前线的人都深深地感到，在蒋军盘踞着台湾和金门、马祖的现在，美帝国主义经常唆使和指挥蒋军进行破坏祖国社会主义建设的时候，守卫好福建沿海这条漫长的海岸线是多么不容易啊！海防战士们要付出多少辛劳。在海岸的沙滩上，在海边的岩石上，在傍海的深山中，都有海岸哨兵的脚迹。
    最近，我访问了海防前哨的一个海岛。在一座海拔几百公尺的山顶上，有一个矮矮的地堡，地堡内住着三个年轻的了望哨兵。六、七级以上的台风经常从海面刮向山上，飞砂走石使山上长不起一棵树木和野草。每次由山下送给哨兵的饭也被海风吹凉。在一个周末的夜晚，我到了这个山上。这时候正是后方的人们在轻歌漫舞，喧闹的街头正响着幽美的交响曲，可是在这山上，只能听到海涛冲击岩石的吼叫，海风掀起小石子沙沙的声音，茫茫的大海怀抱着沉睡的大地。走进地堡内，只有马蹄表发出滴哒的响声。就是这样，一个哨兵端着枪，戴着了望镜长年累月地日夜在观察着海上和天空。我问起一个刚下岗的哨兵，请他谈一下在这里的感想，他说：“也许有人觉得这样的生活寂寞单调，但是，我们哨兵却感到它很丰富，因为我们知道这对祖国有着什么样的意义”。
    每在天气阴霾，风雨交加的黑夜里，海岸巡逻兵们便从渔村旁悄悄地走过，在海滩上和山谷中冒着风雨和飞砂进行机警的搜索。在一个冬夜里，我随着他们去执勤的时候，看到一个年轻力壮的巡逻兵，虽然因为翻山越岭湿透了衣衫，但是所经过的山谷和岩石，凡是有沟有洞的地方，他都要去仔细地检查一番，沙滩上有一个脚印他也要思索一下。当这个二十二岁的青年战士潜伏在一个海边岩石背后的时候，他轻轻地告诉我潮水涨落情况和敌人容易登陆的地方。他对这一带的海面和陆地是那样熟悉。他闭着眼能说出面前海上有几个礁石，什么时候潮水将会涨到什么地方，海滩上和丘陵地，增添一棵小树或多出一个土堆都瞒不过他的眼睛。他怀着坚定的信心说：敌人来一个就捉他一个，半个也不会漏网。黎明了，我随巡逻兵们从野外归来。在海岸巡逻兵们驻地的海岸上，我们看着一批又一批的渔船从海边扬帆驶去，迎着朝阳撒下渔网，看着农民扛着农具、学生背着书包向田间、学校走去，这时，辛勤一夜的战士们却兴奋得也不睡觉了。巡逻兵们说：“这是我们最愉快的时刻。”
