    New Farm Tools for Plowing and Harrowing
    (Our report) A comprehensive farm tool that simultaneously plows and harrows has been successfully manufactured by the Xinzhong Agricultural Cooperative in Yulin County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
    This combined plowing and harrowing tool was created through the collaborative research of Liang Zhi Xiong, the Secretary of the Xinzhong Cooperative Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, and Liang Zhi Ming, an experienced farmer, based on improvements to old farm tools. They installed four harrow teeth of varying lengths at appropriate positions on the soil-turning side of a single-blade plow. In this way, the soil that is turned over is then immediately harrowed and broken up. (According to the statistics of the Ministry of Forestry on April 4th)

    犁田耙田新农具
    本报讯　一种犁田耙田同时进行的综合农具，已由广西僮族自治区玉林县新忠农业社制造成功。
    这种犁耙混合使用农具是中共新忠社支部书记梁志雄和老农梁志明，共同合作钻研，在旧农具基础上改进创造成功的。他们在单铧犁的翻泥的一边，选择适当位置安装四条长短不等的耙齿，这样，翻犁起来的土壤接着就被耙碎了。（据林业部4月4日的统计）
