    Consider the Needs of Shorter People Too

    Having read the report in the People's Daily about two new types of bicycles, I have two feelings: one is great joy, and the other is distress. I am distressed that I am only 1.5 meters tall and cannot ride the high-framed bicycles. The market doesn't seem to have "26-inch" bikes, so I had to buy a "28-inch" "Flying Pigeon" bicycle. The bike is too high, and my legs are too short to reach the pedals, making riding a torment. I suggest that all bicycle factories should consider producing bicycles suitable for shorter people.

    也要为矮个子着想
    看到人民日报曾登了两种新型自行车的报道，我有两种感想：一是很高兴，一是苦恼。苦恼的是为什么我只长一米五高，不能骑高架自行车。市上没有看到有“二六”车，只好买一辆“二八”的“飞鸽”车。车子高，腿短够不着蹬，骑起来活受罪。我建议各自行车厂应该考虑生产适合矮个子用的自行车。
