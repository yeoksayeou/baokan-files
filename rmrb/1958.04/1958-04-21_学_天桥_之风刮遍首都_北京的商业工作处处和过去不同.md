The "Tianqiao" Learning Trend Sweeps the Capital: Beijing's Commercial Work is Different Everywhere From the Past

(Reported by our correspondent Lei Runming) The advanced experience of the Tianqiao Department Store in reforming commercial work has been universally promoted in Beijing's commercial departments, giving the city's commercial work a new look and further strengthening the ties between the Party, the government, and the people in economic life.

The most significant changes are the improvement of service quality and service attitude. Enlightened employees realize that their work is an important link between the Party, the government, and the people in economic life, and they must earnestly serve the people and enthusiastically improve their work. Now, in the streets and alleys of Beijing, whether you enter a store, restaurant, or bathhouse, you can receive a more enthusiastic reception from the staff. The Zhantan Temple Grain Store, which was previously known as a "government office," is now satisfactory to everyone. Representatives of the local residents' committee sent a letter of commendation, taller than a person, to the employees of this grain store, accompanied by gongs and drums. The Dahua Hotel, which was always considered "messy," is now called "a home for travelers" by its guests. Many stores try their best to facilitate customers according to their own characteristics, such as open-shelf sales, and food stores dispatch mobile sales vehicles and grind meat fillings for customers. In many stores, a new phenomenon has emerged: customers lining up to write commendations in the suggestion book; some street residents send banners and post big-character posters of praise to the stores with gongs and drums.

The "one-shift" work method has been implemented in stores throughout the city. The employees of various stores have also generally been streamlined according to the principle of running commerce diligently and thriftily. Now, more than 10,000 commercial employees in the city have stepped onto the front line of labor production. While implementing one-shift work and reducing staff, many stores have improved their internal labor organization and rationally arranged employees' work, study, and rest time. Due to strengthened coordination and cooperation, salespersons are learning multiple sales techniques, developing into "all-round salespersons," and greatly improving work efficiency.

There have also been great improvements in the management of various stores. The units of the Municipal Non-staple Food Commercial Bureau, both wholesale and retail, reduced their cost levels by 11% compared to the plan in the first quarter; commodity losses were reduced by 0.17%, and the profit plan turned over to the state was overfulfilled. The sanitation conditions of non-staple food stores have also been greatly improved. Now, 93% of the stores in the city have reached the standard of "three clean and four no stores." Many stores throughout the city are clearing warehouses and vigorously promoting the sale of inventory goods, making the inventory more reasonable and saving funds for the country.

The situation of the commercial departments' consistently weak political work has changed significantly in the tide of learning from and catching up with "Tianqiao," which is the main reason for the achievements. The leading cadres of many stores go to the counters to participate in sales, cultivate experimental plots, and go deep into the masses to do political and ideological work, so that the socialist consciousness of the vast number of commercial employees has been generally improved, and the idea that some employees belittled commercial work and thought that "Tianqiao" had nothing to learn from has been corrected.

Now, the relevant departments in Beijing are stepping up the evaluation work by industry, establishing advanced models in various industries, in order to promote the advanced experience of Tianqiao Department Store in a more detailed and in-depth manner.

### 学“天桥”之风刮遍首都  北京的商业工作处处和过去不同

    学“天桥”之风刮遍首都
    北京的商业工作处处和过去不同
    本报讯　记者雷润明报道：天桥百货商场改革商业工作的先进经验，已在北京市商业部门普遍推广，使全市商业工作面貌一新，在经济生活中进一步密切了党、政府和人民群众的联系。
    变化特别显著的是服务质量的提高和服务态度的改善。觉悟了的职工，认识到自己的工作是党、政府与人民群众在经济生活上进行联系的重要纽带，必须认真为人民服务，热情地改进工作。现在，在北京市的大街小巷，不论走进那个商店、饭馆或澡塘，都可以得到服务员较热情的接待。过去被称为“衙门口”的旃坛寺粮店，现在变得人人满意，当地的居民委员会的代表，敲锣打鼓把一封一人多高的表扬信送给了这个粮店的职工。一向被认为“乱糟糟”的大华旅社，现在被旅客称为“旅客之家”。很多商店根据自己的特点千方百计的便利顾客，如敞开售货，副食品商店出动流动售货车、代顾客绞肉馅。在很多商店里曾出现顾客排队在意见簿上写表扬意见的新气象；有的街道居民敲锣打鼓给商店送锦旗、贴表扬大字报。
    一班顶的工作方法已经在全市商店中实行。各商店的从业人员，根据勤俭办商业的原则也普遍进行了精简。现在全市已有一万多商业职工走上了劳动生产战线。在实行一班顶、减少人员的同时，很多商店改进了内部的劳动组织，合理安排职工的工作学习和休息时间。由于加强配合协作，售货员学习多种售货技术，向“全能售货员”发展，工作效率大大提高。
    各商店在经营管理上也有很大的改进。市副食品商业局所属各批发和零售单位，第一季度费用水平比计划降低了11％；商品损耗减少0.17％，超额完成了上缴利润计划。副食品商店的卫生状况也有了很大改进，现在全市有93％的商店达到了“三洁四无商店”的标准。全市很多商店都在清理仓库，大力推销库存商品，使库存更加合理，为国家节约资金。
    商业部门一向政治工作薄弱的状况，在学“天桥”赶“天桥”的浪潮中，有了显著改变，这是取得成绩的主要原因。很多商店的领导干部上柜台参加售货，种试验田，深入群众作政治思想工作，使广大商业职工的社会主义觉悟普遍提高，纠正了部分职工中存在的轻视商业工作和认为“天桥”没什么可学的思想。
    现在，北京市的有关部门正在抓紧按行业进行评比工作，树立各行业的先进标兵，以便更细致更深入的推广天桥百货商场的先进经验。
