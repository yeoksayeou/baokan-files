    "Sputnik" Watch

    On April 27, the Jiangling Machinery Factory in Chongqing successfully trial-produced the "Sputnik" brand seventeen-jewel, all-steel, waterproof, and shockproof watch.

    This watch has a beautiful design, and after evaluation, its timekeeping is accurate. The structure of the watch is very complex, and the precision of the parts is also very high. Among them, the smallest drilled holes on the parts are only 30 silks (a unit of measurement), and the smallest shafts are only 15 silks. The smoothness of most of the parts is required to be smoother than glass. The factory is now preparing to produce "Sputnik" watches in small batches.

    “人造卫星牌”手表
    4月27日，重庆江陵机器厂试制成功“人造卫星牌”十七占全钢防水、防震手表。
    这种手表式样美观，经过鉴定，走时准确。手表的结构很复杂，零件的精密度也很高，其中零件上最小的钻孔只有三十丝，最小的轴仅十五丝，绝大部分零件的光洁度都要求比玻璃还要光滑。现在厂里正在准备小批生产“人造卫星牌”手表。
