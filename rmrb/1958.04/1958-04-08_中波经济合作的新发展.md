New Developments in Sino-Polish Economic Cooperation

    The Polish government delegation, led by Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jaroszewicz, conducted a visit to our country for nearly three weeks and held friendly and harmonious talks with our government delegation on issues of economic cooperation between the two countries. The talks achieved results satisfactory to both parties: the signing of the Sino-Polish Long-Term Trade Agreement for 1959-1962 and the Sino-Polish Agreement on Goods Turnover and Payment for 1958. The signing of the Sino-Polish Long-Term Trade Agreement marks a further development in the economic cooperation between China and Poland. This agreement will play an important role in the socialist construction of China and Poland. Premier Zhou Enlai said at the banquet for the distinguished Polish guests: "China and Poland are brothers in the socialist family. The characteristic of this brotherly relationship is mutual assistance, mutual support, and mutual cooperation to seek the common development of socialist construction." This meeting between China and Poland fully embodies the characteristics of this brotherly relationship. We express our warm congratulations on the new achievements of the brotherly mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Poland!
    China and Poland, based on the principle of proletarian internationalism and on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual assistance, have long established extensive economic and cultural cooperation relations. Over the years, with the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of our two countries, great achievements have been made in this cooperation. Taking the development of trade between the two countries as an example, from the signing of the Sino-Polish Trade Agreement in 1950 to 1958, the trade volume between the two countries has increased more than sixteen times. According to the trade agreement between China and Poland, Poland has provided China with a portion of the steel, machinery, and complete sets of industrial equipment needed for China's socialist construction. During China's first Five-Year Plan period, Poland has helped China build the Xinzong Sugar Factory and Jiamusi Sugar Factory, the Linxi Mine shaft and the main equipment of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. At the same time, China has also provided Poland with various important industrial raw materials, agricultural products and food. Since the signing of the Sino-Polish Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement in 1954, the two parties have exchanged more than 200 technical materials; Poland has also sent many experts to help China with its construction. We are deeply grateful to Poland for its assistance in China's socialist construction, and at the same time, we are pleased to be able to contribute a modest amount of strength to Poland's socialist construction.
    After the victorious completion of the first Five-Year Plan, the people of our country are now bravely advancing towards the completion and early completion of the second Five-Year Plan. The Polish people, having victoriously completed the Three-Year Plan and the Six-Year Plan, began to implement a new Five-Year Plan in 1956. The scale of socialist construction in both of our countries is expanding. The expansion of the economic planning base of China and Poland and the common upsurge of the national economy have provided more possibilities for economic cooperation between our two countries, and have provided us with more favorable conditions for strengthening the planning of trade. Under these circumstances, the signing of a long-term economic cooperation agreement between the two countries is of great benefit to each other in planning production and ensuring supply. The long-term economic cooperation agreement is an important form of mutual coordination and collaboration of economic plans among socialist countries, which fully embodies the principle of international labor division among socialist countries.
    In order to strengthen the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Poland, to further develop the economic relations between the two countries, to ensure the continuous growth of the exchange of goods between the two countries, and the coordination and cooperation of the long-term economic plans of the two countries, after the Sino-Polish government talks, the Sino-Polish Long-Term Trade Agreement for 1959-1962 was signed. According to this agreement, China will provide Poland with industrial raw materials, industrial products and other commodities; Poland will provide China with various steel products, various machine tools, transportation vehicles and industrial equipment, including 17 projects such as coal preparation plants, nitrogen fertilizer plants, cement plants and freight car factories. The agreement also stipulates the annual growth rate of trade between China and Poland. Undoubtedly, the signing of the Sino-Polish Long-Term Trade Agreement is not only conducive to the common upsurge of the national economies of our two countries, but also conducive to the strengthening of the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Today, as our distinguished Polish guests leave us to return to their country, we sincerely hope that the guests will bring the deep friendship of the Chinese people to the Polish people to all the Polish people. We wish the Polish people even more brilliant achievements in the cause of socialist construction, wish the eternal brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Polish people to develop and strengthen, and wish the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union to be further consolidated.

### 中波经济合作的新发展

    中波经济合作的新发展
    由波兰部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇率领的波兰政府代表团，在我国进行了将近三个星期的访问，同我国政府代表团就两国经济合作问题进行了友好而融洽的会谈。会谈获得了双方满意的结果：签订了中波1959年—1962年长期贸易协定和中波1958年货物周转和付款协定。中波两国长期贸易协定的签订，标志着中波两国经济合作的进一步的发展。这个协定在中波两国社会主义建设中将发生重要的作用。周恩来总理在欢宴波兰贵宾时曾经说过：“中波两国是社会主义大家庭中的兄弟，这种兄弟关系的特点就是相互帮助，相互支持，彼此合作，求得社会主义建设事业的共同发展。”这次中波两国的会谈充分体现了这种兄弟关系的特点。我们对中波两国兄弟般的互助合作的新成就表示热烈的祝贺！
    中国同波兰根据无产阶级的国际主义原则，在平等互利和互助合作的基础上，早就建立了广泛的经济和文化合作关系。这些年来，这种合作在我们两国政府和人民的共同努力下，已取得了很大的成就。以两国之间贸易的发展来说，自从1950年中波贸易协定签订以来到1958年，两国的贸易额就增长了十六倍以上。根据中波两国的贸易协定，波兰向我国提供了我国社会主义建设中所需要的一部分钢材、机器和成套的工业设备。在我国第一个五年计划期间，波兰已帮助我国建造了新中国糖厂和佳木斯糖厂、林西矿竖井和鞍山钢铁公司的主电设备等。同时，中国也向波兰提供了各种重要的工业原料、农产品和食品等。从1954年中波两国签订了科学和技术合作协定以来，双方共交换了二百多件技术资料；波兰也派遣了不少专家帮助我国进行建设。我们对波兰对中国社会主义建设所给予的帮助深表谢意，同时，也为自己能在波兰的社会主义建设中贡献微薄的力量感到欣慰。
    我国人民在胜利地完成了第一个五年计划之后，正开始为完成和提前完成第二个五年计划奋勇前进。波兰人民也在胜利地完成了三年计划和六年计划的基础上，从1956年开始执行了新的五年计划。我们两国的社会主义建设的规模都正在扩大。中波两国经济计划基础的扩大和国民经济的共同高涨，给我们两国之间的经济合作提供了更多的可能，使我们两国在加强贸易的计划性方面有了更有利的条件。在这种情况下，两国签订长期的经济合作协定，对于彼此在有计划地安排生产和保证供应方面都有很大的好处。长期的经济合作协定是社会主义国家经济计划互相配合协作的重要形式，它充分地体现了社会主义国家国际劳动分工的原则。
    为了加强中波两国的友好团结和互助合作，为了进一步发展两国的经济关系，保证两国货物交换的不断增长，以及两国长期经济计划的协作配合，在这次中波两国政府会谈之后，签订了中波1959—1962年长期贸易协定。根据这个协定，我国将向波兰提供工业原料、工业品和其他商品等；波兰将向我国提供各种钢材、各型机床、运输工具和工业设备，其中包括选煤工厂、氮肥工厂、水泥工厂和货车工厂等十七个项目。协定并规定了中波两国贸易额逐年增长的速度。无疑地，中波两国长期贸易协定的签订，不仅有利于我们两国国民经济的共同高涨，而且有利于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营力量的加强。
    今天，当我们的波兰贵宾们离开我们返国的时候，我们衷心地希望贵宾们把我国人民对波兰人民的深厚友情带给全体波兰人民。祝波兰人民在社会主义建设事业中取得更辉煌的成就，祝中波两国人民永恒的兄弟般的友谊更加发展和加强，祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结更加巩固。
