Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 24th: Liaoning farmers are breaking the centuries-old convention of "busy planting wheat during Qingming, planting large fields during Guyu" by starting spring planting early, around "Qingming."

In the Liaoyang and Jinzhou regions, counties such as Xinjin and Jianchang began plowing and sowing as early as late March, and after Qingming, spring planting reached a climax. Xinjin County completed all field planting by April 15th, shortening the planting period by twenty days compared to previous years. In the Andong region, counties such as Fengcheng and Zhuanghe will also complete all planting before the end of April. Other counties in the Andong region and the Tie岭 region will successively complete planting in early and mid-May, shortening the planting period compared to previous years. In the dozen or so counties in southern and western Liaoning, where the planting season is earlier, many farm households are currently closing their doors, with men, women, and children all going to the fields to water and sow in a concentrated effort for spring planting.

At the beginning of this year's spring plowing and planting, many counties in the Jinzhou and Liaoyang areas faced the threat of drought. Local Party and government leadership organs immediately made emergency deployments, driving the broad masses to launch a drought-resistant planting campaign. Many agricultural cooperatives summarized and promoted local drought-resistant planting experiences through forums with experienced farmers and other methods, ensuring timely planting.

    打破常规提早春播
    辽宁许多农家关门闭户一齐下地
    据新华社沈阳24日电　辽宁农民打破千百年沿习的“清明忙种麦，谷雨种大田”的常规，提早在“清明”前后春播。
    辽阳和锦州专区的新金、建昌等县，早在3月下旬就开犁播种，清明过后春播形成高潮。新金县已在4月15日全部种完大田，播种期比往年缩短二十天。安东专区的凤城、庄河等县，4月底以前也能全部种完。安东专区其他各县和铁岭专区，可以在5月初旬和中旬陆续播完，播种期都将比往年缩短。播种季节较早的辽南、辽西一、二十个县内，目前许多农家关门闭户，男女老少一齐下地，边浇边种，突击春播。
    今年春耕播种一开始，锦州和辽阳两个地区的许多县，就遇到了干旱的威胁。当地党政领导机关即作紧急部署，带动广大群众，掀起抗旱播种运动。许多农业社通过老农座谈会等方式，总结并推行当地抗旱播种的经验，保证了及时播种。
