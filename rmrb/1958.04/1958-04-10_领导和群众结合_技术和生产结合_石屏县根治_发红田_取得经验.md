Combining Leadership and the Masses, Combining Technology and Production
Shí Píng County Achieves Experience in Eradicating “Red Soil Fields”

(Reported by our newspaper) In recent years, Shí Píng County has persistently grasped the soil improvement measure to increase production, turning low-yield "red soil fields" into high-yield fields. The yield per mu of "red soil fields" has generally increased from 200 jin in 1952 to 700 jin. Shí Píng County has also changed from a grain-deficient county to a surplus grain county.

“Red Soil” in Rice Fields Is Not a Natural Disaster

Shí Píng has historically been a grain-deficient county. The main reason for the grain shortage is that the county has more than 18,900 mu of "red soil fields," accounting for 14.3% of the county's paddy fields. Among these "red soil fields," 70% are "cold red" and "lean red," and 30% are "hot red." The rice yield of "red soil fields" is very low, and some even have no harvest at all. In the past, farmers generally used the method of closing water to flood the fields to prevent "red soil" in rice fields. They generally did not fertilize "red soil fields," mistakenly believing that "red soil fields" were highly reactive and would burn the roots if fertilized. Because the problem of preventing "red soil" in rice fields had not been resolved, some people in the masses regarded "red soil" in rice fields as a "natural disaster," and some even regarded "red soil" as a burden, willing to give the fields away for free.

Based on the above situation, the Shí Píng County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to lead the masses to change the "red soil fields" from 1954 onwards. At the end of transplanting in 1954, a "red soil field" prevention and control work conference was held. At this meeting, in addition to specifically studying and deploying the problem of preventing "red soil" in rice fields, it was also required that leaders at all levels go deep into production and into the masses, starting from summarizing and exchanging experience among the masses, and earnestly lead the work of preventing "red soil fields." In order to strengthen the leadership of this work, the "red soil field" work group, headed by Comrade Yáng Péi Shēng, secretary of the county party committee, went deep into Màohé Village and Bàxīn Township to conduct key investigations and research.

	Determined to Dig Deep

After the work group went deep down, they first discovered in a field that had already "turned red" in Táo Village that a piece of rice seedlings that had been fertilized with duck manure and rice husks had not "turned red"; then they discovered that wherever fertilizer had been piled, the rice seedlings grew normally, and the rice seedlings were generally "red" where there was no fertilizer or little fertilizer. This situation immediately aroused the attention of the work group. After analysis, it was initially affirmed that "red soil" in rice fields was due to insufficient fertilizer nutrients. In order to further confirm this problem, the work group on the one hand organized discussions among the masses about the findings, and on the other hand, conducted an experiment of applying ammonium sulfate as top dressing in the "red soil fields" of the farm. A few days later, the rice seedlings in the "red soil fields" that had been top-dressed with ammonium sulfate gradually turned green, while the rice seedlings in the other "red soil fields" that had not been top-dressed gradually withered.

		Finding Solutions from the Masses

After gaining the experience of using ammonium sulfate to save "red soil fields," the work group further deepened the summary and exchange of many farmers' experiences in improving "red soil fields." For example, Lǐ Guǎng Shēng from No. 1 Street, Chéngguān Town, had 2.6 mu of "red soil fields." In 1952, he did not apply fertilizer, and the rice seedlings "turned red," yielding only 380 jin of rice; in 1953, he did not apply fertilizer, and the rice seedlings "turned red" even more severely, yielding only 190 jin; in 1954, he applied cow dung, human manure, and urine, etc., and as a result, the rice seedlings grew well all the time, yielding a total of 1,900 jin. Lǐ Xiù Lán from Yàhuāzhài in the Fourth District planted strong seedlings in one-third of the area and "pine needle seedlings" in two-thirds of the area in 2.1 mu of "red soil fields." As a result, the seedlings planted with strong seedlings did not "turn red" and yielded 380 jin of rice; the seedlings planted with "pine needle seedlings" only yielded 120 jin of rice due to "turning red." Wáng Wén Liàng from Lánzǐyíng Village had been planting green manure and minor spring crops in "red soil fields" since 1953, which gradually reduced the "red" phenomenon to no "red," which not only improved the soil, but also harvested an extra season of minor spring crops. In addition, the experiences of Yáng Jiā Wàng and others in Běicāng, Jiùzhài and other villages in adopting various drainage methods such as middle ditches, waist ditches, raincoat ditches, side ditches, and ridge ditches according to the terrain and topography to improve "cold red fields" and adopting the methods of drying fields and top dressing to improve "lean red fields" were also summarized.

			Further Experimentation and Promotion

In order to fundamentally take measures to completely change the "red soil fields," following the above-mentioned experience, the Southwest Agricultural Science Institute and the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station jointly formed a professional working group in 1955 and 1956 to conduct various experimental research work on improving "red soil fields" based on the investigation and summary of farmers' experience in 1954. During the experiment, the main focus was on comparing quick-acting top dressing and concentrated fertilization, combined with increasing the application of base fertilizer, topsoil, and plowing. In order to facilitate the promotion of experimental results and closely integrate experimental research work with mass production, demonstration fields were established in addition to the county farm as the center. Subsequently, a short-term training class for "red soil" prevention and control, mainly for township and commune cadres, was opened at the county farm, and nearby masses and representatives of 31 agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups were organized to visit. In this way, the technical team for improving "red soil fields" was strengthened throughout the county, effectively promoting the large-scale prevention and control of rice field reddening, and more than 85% of the "red soil fields" in various districts were rescued in a short period of time.

### 领导和群众结合　技术和生产结合  石屏县根治“发红田”取得经验

    领导和群众结合　技术和生产结合
    石屏县根治“发红田”取得经验
    本报讯　石屏县几年来坚持不懈地抓紧改良土壤这一增产措施，变低产的“发红田”为高产田，每亩“发红田”的产量一般由1952年的二百斤增加到七百斤；石屏县也由缺粮县变为余粮县。
    稻田“发红”不是天灾
    石屏是个历史上的缺粮县。缺粮的主要原因是全县约有一万八千九百亩以上的“发红田”，占全县水田面积的14.3％。这些“发红田”中，有70％属于“冷红”和“瘦红”，有30％属于“热红”。“发红田”稻谷的产量都很低，有的甚至全无收成。过去，农民们一般是采取关水淹田的办法，来防治稻田“发红”，对发红田一般不施肥，误认为“发红田”暴性大，施了肥会烧根。由于防治稻田“发红”的问题没有得到解决，群众中有的把稻田“发红”认为是“天灾”，有的人甚至把“发红”当成负担，愿意无偿地把田送给人。
    根据以上情况，中共石屏县委从1954年起，决心领导群众改变“发红田”。在1954年栽插结束时，就召开了“发红田”防治工作会议。在这次会上，除具体地对防治稻田“发红”的问题进行了研究布置外，还要求各级领导深入生产、深入群众，从总结交流群众中的经验入手，把防治“发红田”的工作认真领导起来。为了加强对这一工作的领导，以县委书记杨培生同志为首组织了“发红田”工作组，先后深入到冒合村、坝心乡一带重点进行调查研究。
            狠心钻下去
    工作组深入下去以后，首先在陶村的一丘已经“发红”的田里，发现有一片施过鸭粪、粗糠的秧苗没有“发红”；接着又发现凡是堆过肥料的地方秧苗都生长正常，不施肥和施肥少的地方秧苗就普遍“发红”。这一情况立即引起了工作组的重视。经过分析，初步肯定稻田“发红”是由于肥料养分不足。为了进一步证实这一问题，工作组一方面把发现的情况在群众中组织讨论，一方面在农场的“发红田”里作了追施硫酸錏的试验。几天以后，施过硫酸錏追肥的“发红田”里的秧苗就逐渐转青，其他没有追肥的“发红田”的秧苗却日渐枯萎。
                向群众找办法
    在取得用硫酸錏挽救“发红田”的经验以后，工作组又进一步深入总结交流了很多农民改良“发红田”的经验。如城关镇一街李广生，有二亩六分“发红田”，1952年没有施肥，秧苗“发红”，只收得稻谷三百八十斤；1953年也没有施肥，秧苗“发红”更严重，只收得一百九十斤；1954年施了牛粪、人粪尿等，结果秧苗一直生长良好，共收一千九百斤。四区亚花寨李秀兰，在两亩一丘的“发红田”中，以三分之一的面积栽壮秧，三分之二栽“松毛秧”，结果栽壮秧的没有“发红”，收得谷子三百八十斤；栽“松毛秧”的由于“发红”，只收得谷子一百二十斤。兰子营村王文亮，从1953年起就在“发红田”里种植绿肥和小春作物，从而使“发红”现象逐年减轻到不“发红”，不但改良了土壤，还多收了一季小春。另外，还总结了北仓、旧寨等村杨家旺等按地形、地势采取中沟、腰沟、蓑衣沟、边沟、坎沟等多种开沟排水的办法，改良“冷红田”，采取晒田、追肥的办法改良“瘦红田”的经验。
              进一步试验推广
    为了从根本上采取措施，彻底改变“发红田”，继取得上述经验之后，西南农业科学研究所和省农业试验站，又在1955年和1956年联合组成专业工作组，在1954年调查总结农民经验的基础上，进行了各种改良“发红田”的试验研究工作。试验时，主要是作速效追肥、集中施肥，结合进行增施底肥客土和耕犁等的对比试验。为了有利于试验成果的推广，和使试验研究工作与群众生产紧密结合，除了以县农场为中心，还分别建立了示范田。接着，在县农场开办了一个以乡、社干部为主的“发红”防治短期训练班，同时组织了附近群众和三十一个农业社、互助组的代表进行参观。这样，就使得改良“发红田”的技术队伍在全县范围内壮大起来，有力地推动了大面积防治稻田发红的工作，各区“发红田”在短期内得到挽救的就达85％以上。
