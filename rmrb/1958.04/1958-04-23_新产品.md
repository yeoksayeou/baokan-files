      Insulating Asbestos Paper
    A new product in the asbestos industry—0.2 mm insulating asbestos paper—has recently been successfully trial-produced ahead of schedule in the "experimental field" of leading cadres of the Jilin Asbestos Factory.
   0.2 mm insulating asbestos paper has a wide range of uses in the electrical machinery, chemical and other industrial sectors. The factory director, union chairman, and head of the electromechanical workshop of the Jilin Asbestos Factory worked with the workers to overcome technical and equipment difficulties, and also invited technical cadres from other factories to come to the factory to help guide them, so that the new product was successfully trial-produced more than two years ahead of schedule.

    Popular Battery Lamp
    The Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has successfully trial-produced an air battery lamp using sunflower seed husks, cottonseed husks, and charcoal. This battery lamp is not only suitable for indoors, but can also be used for nighttime lighting in the fields and on construction sites. Each one costs only six or seven jiao and can be used for three months.
    Currently, the leading cadres of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative are personally working alongside the staff to rush production of battery lamps, preparing to use practical teaching methods at the upcoming provincial on-site conference on air battery lamps to teach the manufacturing technology to those attending, so that it can be widely promoted in rural areas. They also plan to establish air battery lamp factories with cotton purchasing stations in various counties as the focus, utilizing local materials and waste products for manufacturing.
