    Promote a Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production
    Price Reductions on Some Pesticides and Equipment
    Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: The Second Ministry of Commerce recently submitted a request to the relevant departments of the State Council for approval to reduce the retail prices of several major pesticides and certain types of equipment this year. This measure will further encourage agricultural production cooperatives to actively prevent and control crop diseases and insect pests, and promote a great leap forward in agricultural production.
    A total of nine pesticides and two types of equipment are included in this price reduction. The price reductions are relatively substantial. For example, 25% DDT emulsion has been reduced from 1.55 yuan per catty to 0.80 yuan, a decrease of 48.4%; 6% wettable BHC has been reduced from 0.46 yuan per catty to 0.35 yuan, a decrease of 23.9%.

    促进农业生产大跃进
    部分农药、药械降价
    据新华社8日讯　第二商业部最近报请国务院主管部门批准，决定今年降低几种主要农药和某些药械的零售价格。这一措施将进一步鼓励农业生产合作社积极防治农作物病虫害，促进农业生产大跃进。
    这次降低价格的共有九种农药和两种药械。降价的幅度都比较大。如25％滴滴涕乳剂由每市斤一元五角五分降到八角，下降48.4％；6％可湿性六六六由每市斤四角六分降到三角五分，下降23.9％。
