    Livestock Files

    The Dongfanghong Third Agricultural Cooperative in Xixian County, Shanxi Province, has created a new method for managing livestock – the livestock file system. Recently, the cooperative has used this method to establish file materials for all 307 cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys in the cooperative.

    This method was proposed by members of the Dongfanghong Third Agricultural Cooperative during the continuous improvement of livestock management. The cooperative has always attached great importance to the use and breeding of livestock, and as early as 1956, it established evaluation and inspection cards for each animal. Due to the rapid development of livestock in the agricultural cooperative and the improvement of feeding management, these cards became increasingly simple and fragmented, and could no longer meet the needs. After repeated painstaking exploration, research, and improvement by the members, the livestock file system was recently summarized and created. The contents of the file include thirteen items such as gender, age (by teeth), coat color, body length, chest width, characteristics, habits, eating speed, production, breeding, health status, and quarterly evaluation records. Forms are made, and each livestock is registered in duplicate, one copy kept by the production team and one copy kept by the cooperative's animal husbandry section. The cooperative cadres and members responsible for using, feeding, and inspecting the livestock record any changes and relevant information, such as mating and pregnancy, evaluations, and work performance, on the file form at any time, and the file is transferred wherever the livestock is transferred. When a new young animal is born, a file is immediately established for it.

    This method has many advantages. It can reasonably use livestock and allocate appropriate farm work according to the animal. Those good at pulling carts pull carts, and those suitable for plowing plow the fields. Whether it is internal adjustment within the cooperative or sales to the outside, the file is carried along, which is very convenient for new cooperative members and buyers using the livestock. The agricultural cooperative can also use the file materials to plan and manage livestock breeding, promotion, and elimination work. The cooperative members live in 27 small villages, and the cooperative implements a household feeding method for livestock. The livestock file can also be used as a basis for evaluating the work of the feeders and feeding households. (Yang Yi)

    牲畜档案
    山西省隰县东方红第三农业社创造出一种管理牲畜的新办法——牲畜档案制。最近社里采取这种办法已经给全社的三百零七头牛、马、骡、驴分别建立了档案材料。
    这种办法是东方红第三农业社社员们在不断改进牲畜管理工作过程中提出来的。这个社对牲畜使役、养育工作一向很重视，早在1956年就为每个牲畜建立了评比、检查卡片。由于农业社牲畜迅速的发展和饲养管理的改进，这种卡片越来越显得简单零碎，不能适应需要了。经过社员们一再苦心摸索、钻研提高，最近总结创造出牲畜档案制。档案的内容有性别、口齿、毛色、身长、胸宽、特点、习性、饮食快慢、生产、配种、健康状况，以及四季评比记录等十三个项目。制成表格，每个牲畜登记两份，一份由生产队掌握，一份由社畜牧股掌握。负责使用、饲养和检查牲畜的社干部和社员们，随时把牲畜的变化和有关情况如配种怀驹、评比、劳动表现等，写在档案表格材料上，牲畜转移到那里档案转移到那里。新生下幼畜，马上就给他建立起档案。
    这种办法好处很多，能够合理地使用牲畜，按畜分配适宜农活。擅长拉车的拉车，适宜犁地的犁地。无论是社内调整或向外出卖，随时带上档案，对新使用牲畜的社员和买主都很方便。农业社根据档案材料还能有计划地掌握牲畜繁殖、推销和淘汰工作。这个社社员分居在二十七个小村庄，社内牲畜实行分户喂养的办法，牲畜档案还能作为评比饲养员、饲养户工作好坏的根据。　（杨义）
