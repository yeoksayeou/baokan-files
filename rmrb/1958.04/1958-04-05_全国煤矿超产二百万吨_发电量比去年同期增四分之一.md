Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. National state-owned coal mine workers produced a total of more than 27,980,000 tons of raw coal in the first quarter of this year, exceeding the original state plan by 10.9%, an overproduction of 2,760,000 tons of raw coal. This also exceeds the preliminary determined leap forward target for this year by 1.7%.

In the first quarter of this year, the average daily output of national state-owned coal mines increased by 35.52% compared to the same period last year; it also increased by 10.55% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, which had the highest daily output. This is a remarkable achievement made by all coal mine workers in the great leap forward in production launched on the basis of the double-anti movement.

Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. State-owned power plants under the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power have overfulfilled the power generation plan for the first quarter by 4.4%. The electric power bureaus in Shanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Beijing, Shanghai, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which have done a better job in completing the plan, have all exceeded the power generation plan for the first quarter by more than 7%.

Since the beginning of this year, the demand for electricity in industrial and mining enterprises and some agricultural production units across the country has increased significantly during the great leap forward in production. Local electric power units have taken measures to speed up the construction of power plants, put newly added production equipment into operation early, and shorten equipment maintenance periods, extend maintenance intervals, and restore equipment output to increase equipment utilization, actively increasing production. In the first quarter of this year, state-owned power plants generated 900 million kilowatt-hours more than in the same period last year, an increase of 26%. Calculated according to the annual production leap forward plan of the state-owned electric power industry, the electricity produced in the first quarter has accounted for 22% of the annual plan, which is higher than the proportion accounted for in the same period in 1956 and 1957.

    全国煤矿超产二百万吨
    发电量比去年同期增四分之一
    新华社4日讯　全国国营煤矿职工在今年第一季度里，共生产了原煤二千七百九十八万多吨，超过原定国家计划10.9％，一共超产了二百七十六万多吨原煤；比起初步确定的今年的跃进指标，还超过了1.7％。
    在今年第一季度中，全国国营煤矿的平均日产量比去年同期提高35.52％；比去年日产量最高的第四季度，也提高了10.55％。这是全体煤矿职工在双反运动的基础上，掀起的生产大跃进所取得的显著成果。
    新华社4日讯　水利电力部所属国营发电厂第一季度发电量计划，已经超额4.4％完成。完成计划较好的山西、甘肃、湖南、北京、上海、内蒙古等省、市、自治区电业局，第一季的发电量计划都超额7％以上。
    今年以来，全国各地工矿企业及一部分农业生产单位，在生产大跃进中用电需要量显著增加。各地电业单位采取了加快电厂建设工程进度、提早投入新增加生产设备和缩短设备检修工期、延长检修间隔、恢复设备出力等提高设备利用率的措施，积极增加生产。今年第一季度国营发电厂比去年同期多发电九亿度，增长26％。按照国营电力工业全年的生产跃进计划计算，第一季度生产的电力已占到全年计划的22％，比1956年1957年同一时期所占的比例都高。
