    Shijiazhuang Steel Plant Produces Iron
    Kunming Steel Rolling Plant Starts Construction
    (Our report) The Shijiazhuang Steel Plant, which began construction on February 6th, has, after a little over two months, put one of the first batch of three blast furnaces into operation on April 13th and produced its first batch of pig iron. The steelmaking workshop and the steel rolling workshop will also soon begin construction.
    After the Shijiazhuang Steel Plant is fully completed, it will lay a material foundation for the development of Shijiazhuang's agricultural machinery industry. In addition to meeting the needs of Shijiazhuang City for manufacturing agricultural machinery such as tractors, portable steam engines, and water pumps, the steel it produces can also be transported to support other regions. In the process of construction, a group of design and construction technical personnel have also been trained. Now, they have begun to design 50 and 55 cubic meter blast furnaces.
    (Our report) The Kunming Steel Rolling Plant, with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel ingots and steel products, has begun construction. This is Yunnan's second mechanized steelmaking plant. It has workshops for rolling steel, melting furnaces, casting iron, mixing sand, power distribution, forging, repair, and carpentry. The entire project will be completed by the end of this year, and it is expected to be partially put into production in August, starting to produce steel. The main products include various small-sized angle steel, round steel, square steel, steel ingots, and steel castings.

    石家庄钢铁厂出铁
    昆明轧钢厂动工
    本报讯　2月6日开工兴建的石家庄钢铁厂，经过短短两个月多一点的时间，第一批建设的三个炼铁高炉已有一座在4月13日正式投入生产，并炼出了第一炉生铁。炼钢车间和轧钢车间也即将开工兴建。
    石家庄钢铁厂全部建成后，给石家庄农业机械工业的发展，奠定了物质基础。它生产的钢铁，除了满足石家庄市制造拖拉机、锅驼机、水泵等农业机械所需要外，还可输送一部分支援其它地区。在施工建设中还培养出一批设计、施工技术人材。现在，他们已开始设计五十和五十五立方公尺的高炉。
    本报讯　年产五万吨钢锭和钢材的昆明市轧钢厂已经动工兴建。这是云南第二座机械化的炼钢厂。它有轧钢、熔炉、铸铁、混砂、配电、锻工、修理、木工等车间。全部工程将在今年底完成，预计8月即可局部投入生产，开始出钢。主要产品有各类小型号角钢、圆钢、方钢、钢锭以及浇钢铸件等。
