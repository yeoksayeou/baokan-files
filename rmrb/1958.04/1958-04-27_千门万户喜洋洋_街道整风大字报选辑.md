Thousands of Homes Rejoice
    ——Selected Wall Posters from Street Rectification
    Old in Years, But the Heart Is Not Old
    Old in years, but the heart is not old, I run all over the street when I work. All your challenge conditions are met, and a few more will be added. I look out of this door and peek into that door, the wind and rain can't stop my "sixty"-year-old self. Don't look down on my lack of education, but I have two steel legs that no one can compare to. Finally, I guarantee that the public security work will be done well, and you can wait for a year without accidents!
    (Ma Suwen, Beijing College Alley)
    Saving Cotton Cloth
    There is one thing to do in household labor, and saving cotton cloth is the most important. The country is in the early stages of construction, and the supply is difficult. Everyone has two zhang of cloth tickets, so we should save and not use them all. Laugh at dirty clothes, don't laugh at torn clothes, mend them and they can still be worn. Every set of clothes saves a little cloth, calculate carefully before cutting. Old clothes can be made into new clothes, and if the绒衣 is worn out, it can be used to alter clothes for the children. Coats can be made into shirts, and faded ones can be dyed. Children's clothes should be simple, and it's not worth sewing too much. As long as you pay attention to this issue, saving a little is saving a little. One chi and one cun is not a small amount, and it is natural to accumulate small amounts into large amounts. This is a good experience and worth promoting to everyone.
      (Zheng Zengxian, Fuxue Street, Xi'an)
    Growing Vegetables
    Diligence and thrift are loved by everyone, I grow vegetables in the yard. The vegetables grow well, and we can't eat them all year round. Growing vegetables is loved by everyone, and the extra money is used to buy public bonds. The vegetables grow really well, and a happy life comes early.
      (Dang Yuzhen, Anju Alley, Xi'an)
    Thrift Rhyme
    Diligence is a money-shaking tree, thrift is a cornucopia. Touch the cornucopia, and you'll find gold hands and silver arms. You can be diligent in production and thrifty in saving money. Daily life is not difficult, and saving and depositing is a model. Stride forward and move straight ahead, a bright future is in sight.
    (Quan Pingzhou, Baishu Village Street, Xi'an)
    Good Feelings Between Sisters-in-Law
    We have been relatives since we were young, and our feelings were originally good. We are both laborers, and our ideological foundation is solid. We don't care about small details in life. Don't listen to rumors from others, and don't speak badly about each other behind their backs. If the children quarrel, don't blame the other party, blame yourself for not educating them well. Take care of each other in life, and ask the other party if they want anything you buy. Care about each other when there are difficulties, and help each other to have good feelings.
      (Rong Meizhen, Wang Jinxiu, Chunyuan Lane, Shanghai)

    千门万户喜洋洋
    ——街道整风大字报选辑
  年岁大，心不老年岁大，心不老，干起活来满街跑。你的挑战条件全做到，另外还要加几条，这门出来那门瞧，风雨挡不住我“六十”老儿，别瞧咱的文化少，却有两条钢腿谁也比不了，最后保证治安工作做得好，一年不出事故你们等着瞧！
    （北京学院胡同马素文）
  节约棉布家务劳动有一件，节约棉布最为先。国家正在建设初，大量供应有困难。每人布票两丈正，应当节约别用完。衣服笑脏不笑烂，补补缝缝还能穿。每套衣服布把省，未剪之前仔细算。旧衣能把新衣改，绒衣烂了给娃改衣衫。大衣能把衬衣改，退了色的可以染。小孩衣服应从简，缝的多了不合算。只要注意这问题，节约一点是一点。一尺一寸不算少，积少成多理当然。这是一个好经验，值得大家来宣传。
      （西安府学街郑增贤）
  种青菜勤俭持家人人爱，我在院里种青菜。种下青菜长的好，一年四季吃不了。种下青菜人人爱，余下钱来买公债。青菜长的实在好，幸福生活来的早。
      （西安安居巷党玉珍）
  勤俭谣勤是摇钱树，俭是聚宝盆。聚宝盆里摸一摸，摸出了金手银胳膊。既能勤劳搞生产，又能节俭把钱攒。日常生活不困难，节约储蓄当模范。大踏步，直向前，美好的前程在眼前。
    （西安柏树村街权平舟）姑嫂感情好从小是亲戚，感情本来好。同是劳动者，思想基础牢。生活细节小事不计较。不听旁人传来言，背后不讲对方不好。子女吵闹不怪对方，先怪自己教育不好。生活互相照顾，买到东西就问对方要不要。有困难多关心，互相帮助感情好。
