    Helping Readers Advance in
    Dialectical Materialism
    In this era of the Great Leap Forward, everyone feels the urgent need to study and apply dialectics.
    Recently, the People's Daily has increased the number of ideological commentaries, short commentaries, and short essays. Some of the well-written ones can be said to be vivid and practical teaching materials for dialectical materialist methods and viewpoints. However, I still hope to see articles that have a foundational and systematic nature, while also being well integrated with practice, to expound on dialectical methods and materialist viewpoints, in order to help readers advance in dialectical materialism and enable us to have a great leap forward in our thinking.

    帮助读者进修
    辩证唯物主义
    在这大跃进的时代，大家都感到学习和运用辩证法迫不及待。
    近来，人民日报上增加了思想评论和短评、短论。有一些写得好的可说是辩证唯物主义方法和观点的生动的、实际的教材。但我还希望能看到带有基础性、系统性同时又能很好结合实际来阐述辩证的方法和唯物的观点的文章，来帮助读者进修辩证唯物主义，使得我们在思想上来个大跃进。
