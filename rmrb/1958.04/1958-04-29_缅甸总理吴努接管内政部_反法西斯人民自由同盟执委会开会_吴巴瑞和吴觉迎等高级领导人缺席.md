Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 28th. According to a report in the Rangoon "Guardian" on the 27th, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu began taking over the Ministry of Interior on the 26th. The newspaper learned from reliable sources that former Interior Minister Thakin Tha Kin announced his resignation when Prime Minister U Nu informed him of the arrangements for taking over the Ministry of Interior.

Prime Minister U Nu told a reporter from the Rangoon "Nation" on the 27th that he would deliver a radio address in a few days to explain the current political situation in Burma and the issue of his taking over the Ministry of Interior. He said that his speech would help stabilize the national mood.

Thakin Tha Kin, who served as Deputy General Secretary in the ruling Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League in Burma, was appointed Minister of Interior in June 1956. He recently led a trade delegation to India, but before trade negotiations even began, he was urgently recalled to Rangoon on the 25th.

The "Guardian" said that while taking over the Ministry of Interior, Prime Minister U Nu established a special four-member advisory committee to consult him on the overall management of the country. The members of this committee are the Secretary-General of the Burmese Federal Government, U Kyin Maung Pyu, the Inspector General of Police, U Bo, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, James Barrington, and the Secretary of Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, U Tun Thin. Barrington and U Tun Thin will serve as joint secretaries.

According to a report in the Rangoon "Nation", the Ministry of Interior recently ordered the arrest of leaders of some local organizations of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, as well as some leaders and general members of the All-Burma Peasants' Association. According to official figures, a total of 457 people were arrested in the three regions of Rangoon, Hanthawaddy District, and Insein District.

On April 22nd, Prime Minister U Nu said at a press conference that the recent large-scale arrests of local leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League were unrelated to the internal struggles within the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. He also said, however, that among those arrested were people close to Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and people close to the General Secretary of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, Thakin Chit Maung (note: Thakin Chit Maung is one of the leaders of the All-Burma Peasants' Association).

Prime Minister U Nu said at this press conference that the existence of contradictions between the various factions of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League is an undeniable fact. If these contradictions are not stopped in time, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League will disintegrate.

The "Nation" said on the 28th that the news of Prime Minister U Nu's dismissal of Thakin Tha Kin from the post of Minister of Interior and his concurrent assumption of the post had caused a serious reaction throughout the country. It is generally believed that this is of great significance to the factional struggle, as Thakin Tha Kin is considered a supporter of U Kyaw Nyein. The newspaper believes that the reason for the current factional struggle is that U Kyaw Nyein strongly opposed the re-election of Thakin Chit Maung as General Secretary at the last Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Congress.

According to Rangoon newspapers on the 27th, most of the senior leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, including Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe, U Kyaw Nyein, Thakin Tin, and Interior Minister Thakin Tha Kin, did not attend the meeting of the League's Executive Committee held on the morning of the 26th. Rangoon journalists believe this is an important event in Burma's current political life.

According to newspaper reports, the meeting passed a written proposal put forward by U Kyaw Nyein requesting a postponement of the deadline for holding Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League meetings in counties, towns, and rural areas, so that the League's youth organization (U Kyaw Nyein is the chairman of this organization) could have representation in the future local executive committees of the League. This youth organization was only recently established and needs some time to build a nationwide organization.

    缅甸总理吴努接管内政部
    反法西斯人民自由同盟执委会开会
    吴巴瑞和吴觉迎等高级领导人缺席
    新华社仰光28日电　据仰光“卫报”27日报道，缅甸总理吴努从26日起开始接管内政部。这家报纸从可靠方面获悉，前内政部长德钦达庆在吴努总理把接管内政部事务的安排告诉他的时候，就宣告辞职。
    吴努总理在27日对仰光“民族报”记者说，他将在几天内发表广播演说，说明缅甸目前的政局以及他接管内政部的问题。他说，他的这次演说将有助于安定全国人心。
    在缅甸执政党反法西斯人民自由同盟内担任副总书记的德钦达庆是在1956年6月被任命为内政部长的。他在最近曾经率领一个贸易代表团去印度，但在贸易谈判还没有开始之前，他就在25日被匆匆地召回仰光。
      “卫报”说，吴努总理在接管内政部的同时，设立了一个四人特别顾问委员会来在全面管理国家方面供他谘询。这个委员会的委员是缅甸联邦政府秘书长吴庆貌漂、警察总监吴波、外交部常任秘书詹姆斯·巴林顿和副总理吴觉迎的秘书吴吞东。巴林顿和吴吞东将任联合秘书。
    据仰光“民族报”报道，最近内政部曾经下令逮捕了反法西斯人民自由同盟的一些地方组织的领导人以及全缅农民协会的一些领导人和一般成员。据官方发表的数字，在仰光、罕礁越利县和永生县三个地区，一共逮捕了四百五十七人。
    在4月22日，吴努总理曾经在一次记者招待会上说，最近反法西斯人民自由同盟的地方领袖大批被捕与反法西斯人民自由同盟内部的斗争无关。他又说，然而，被捕的人中有接近副总理吴觉迎的人和接近反法西斯人民自由同盟总书记德钦觉顿的人（按，德钦觉顿是全缅农民协会的领导人之一）。
    吴努总理在这次记者招待会上说，反法西斯人民自由同盟的各集团之间存在矛盾是不可否认的事实。如果这种矛盾不能及时制止，反法西斯人民自由同盟就会瓦解。
      “民族报”在28日说，吴努总理解除德钦达庆的内政部长职务并且自兼内政部长的消息已经在全国引起严重反响。人们普遍认为，这对派系斗争具有重大意义，因为德钦达庆被认为是吴觉迎的一个支持者。这家报纸认为，产生目前的派系斗争的原因是，吴觉迎非常反对在上次反法西斯人民自由同盟的代表大会上重新选出德钦觉顿为总书记。
    另据仰光报纸27日报道，包括副总理吴巴瑞、吴觉迎、德钦丁和内政部长德钦达庆在内的反法西斯人民自由同盟的多数高级领导人，都没有出席同盟的执行委员会在26日上午举行的会议。仰光报界人士认为这是缅甸目前政治生活中的一个重要事件。
    据报纸报道，这次会议通过了吴觉迎提出的一项书面建议，要求推迟各县、市镇和乡村地区召开反法西斯人民自由同盟会议的期限，以便使这个同盟的青年组织（吴觉迎是这个组织的主席）在将来同盟的地方执行委员会中享有代表权。这个青年组织最近刚刚成立，需要过一些时候才能建立起全国范围的组织。
