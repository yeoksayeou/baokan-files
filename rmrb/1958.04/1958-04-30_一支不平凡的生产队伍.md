    An Extraordinary Production Team
    Xie Juezai

    As industrial and agricultural production across the country experiences a great leap forward, so too does this social welfare endeavor in various cities, organizing families of martyrs, families of servicemen, disabled veterans, and some city residents with weak labor capacity or those who, though having labor capacity, are not fully employed and face difficulties in their lives, to engage in production. This year's report on Xuzhou City is one such example. According to incomplete statistics from the Urban Relief Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs: by the end of 1957, 580,000 people had participated in this type of production, and the number is expanding daily.

    The characteristics of this production are:

    1.  It is adapted to local conditions and to the times, capable of organizing all semi-laborers or those with very weak labor capacity into production, unleashing their potential, improving their lives, and giving them a sense of purpose and belonging.

    2.  It requires little capital construction investment. Many cooperatives or groups have only used a portion of relief funds as capital or even started from scratch. Workshops are built by themselves, with thatched roofs and board supports, gradually using their own accumulation to build brick and tile houses. Tools are made and improved by themselves, some having already achieved semi-mechanization. They are the best examples of running enterprises with diligence and thrift.

    3.  Raw materials mostly come from waste and discarded materials. Garbage, furnace ash, waste cotton, waste linen, scrap copper, broken iron...everything useless turns into valuable treasure in their hands. For example, using garbage to make granular fertilizer, furnace ash to make many kinds of building materials, waste cotton and linen to weave beautiful and practical tablecloths or cloth, scrap copper and broken iron to become exquisite utensils or instruments. Just by looking at their exhibitions, you will be amazed by the wisdom of the poor people, who truly can "turn the rotten into the miraculous."

    4.  The sense of collectivism is particularly strong. They are poor and have nothing except the collective, so they cherish the collective very much. A large portion of the production income is often used for expanding reproduction; they rely on their own accumulation instead of government investment. Members support each other when difficulties arise, and factories, cooperatives, or groups are never stingy with mutual assistance.

    5.  Some outstanding technical and management personnel, free from old habits, have already emerged or are emerging from among them.

    6.  The production they engage in, serving industry and agriculture, providing daily necessities for the people, is both socially necessary and will be socially necessary in the long term. Many cities have included it in their overall economic construction plans, strengthening leadership over them and adjusting their raw material supply and product sales.

    7.  Many members were originally relief recipients, with monthly relief funds of only three or five yuan, barely enough to maintain their lives. After participating in production, they can earn tens or even dozens of yuan per month. They not only improve their lives, but more importantly, become self-reliant and feel liberated in spirit, feeling that they are useful people in the entire socialist construction, contributing a share to building the socialist edifice. Therefore, they are all in good spirits, and their bodies are healthier than before.

    Most of them have withdrawn from relief.

    Of course, social relief agencies should pay close attention to those who should be relieved—those with weak labor capacity, those with illnesses, and those whose labor income is insufficient to maintain their lives—and supplement their needs, and some should even be advised not to overwork. Many places already have surplus relief funds. It is foreseeable that a new phenomenon will emerge: it will not be people seeking relief knocking on the doors of relief agencies, but relief agencies knocking on the doors of those who should receive relief.

    This is an extraordinary production team, which has already created extraordinary achievements. The Ministry of Internal Affairs will hold a national product exhibition of welfare-oriented production in various cities and towns in conjunction with the Fourth National Civil Affairs Conference in May. It will show the whole picture of this type of production to the people of the whole country.

    This type of production still has many potential aspects, both human and material, to be explored, and many organizational, technical, and management-related tasks to be studied. However, undoubtedly, with the full efforts of the people and the support of the Party and government, it will be continuously resolved and progress will be made.

    一支不平凡的生产队伍
    谢觉哉
    全国工农业生产在大跃进，各个城市组织烈属、军属、残废军人以及一些劳动力弱和虽有劳动力而因没有充分就业、生活尚有困难的市民从事生产的这个社会福利事业也在大跃进，今年关于徐州市的报道，就是一个例子。据内务部城市救济司的不完全统计：1957年底参加这类生产已有五十八万人，并且一天天在扩大。
    这种生产的特点：
    一、是因地制宜因时制宜，能够把所有半劳动力或劳动力很弱的人都组织到生产里去，发挥他们的潜力，使他们生活得到改善，身心也有所依托。
    二、不要多少基建资金。很多社或组只利用了一部分救济款作资金甚至是白手起家的。厂房是自己动手、茅盖板支，逐渐用自己的积累建筑砖瓦房子。工具是自己制造自己改良，有的已达到半机械化。他们是勤俭办企业的最好榜样。
    三、原料大都来自废品废物。垃圾、炉灰、废棉、废麻、破铜、烂铁……一切无用的东西，到了他们手里，都变成有用的宝贝。比如用垃圾制成颗粒肥、炉灰制成很多种的建筑用料，废棉废麻织出美丽适用的台毯或用布，破铜烂铁，变成精美的用具或仪器。只要到他们的展览会一看，你就会惊奇贫苦人民的智慧，真是能“化臭腐为神奇”。
    四、集体感特别强。他们穷，除集体外一无所有，所以非常爱护集体。生产所得，常常是很大部分用之于扩大再生产，他们不依靠政府投资而依靠自己积累。各个成员间、各个厂、社或组间，有困难互相支援也绝不吝惜。
    五、他们中间已经出现或正在出现一些出色的不带有旧的气习的技术人员和管理人员。
    六、他们搞的为工、农业服务的生产、为供给人民日用品的生产，都是社会所必需、也将是长期的社会所必需，许多城市已把它列入整个经济建设计划里面加强对他们的领导，调整其原料供应与产品推销。
    七、许多成员原是救济对象，每月三几元的救济金只能勉强维持生活。参加生产后每月可得十几元以至几十元，他们不只是生活提高，主要还是自食其力、精神上成为解放了的人，感到自己在整个社会主义建设中是一个有用的人，为建设社会主义大厦贡献了一分力量，因而都心情畅快，身体也都比前健康。
    他们大都退了救济。
    自然，应该救济的人——劳动力弱的人，有疾病的人、劳动所得不足维持生活的人，社会救济机关要随时注意，补其不足，有的还要劝其不必过劳。现已有不少地方救济经费用不完。可以预见：新的现象，将不是要求救济的人找上救济机关的门，而是救济机关找上应受救济者的门。
    这是一支不平凡的生产队伍，已经创造了不平凡的成绩。内务部准备于5月召开的第四次民政会议将附带举行全国各城镇属于福利事业性质的生产品展览。它将昭示全国人民以这类生产的全貌。
    这类生产，还有许多属于人的或物的潜力待发掘，有许多组织的、技术的、管理的一系列的工作待研究。然而，无疑，在人民的十足干劲和党政的支持下，将不断得到解决和进展。
