Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, April 7th: A signing ceremony for the China-North Korea agreement on the design book for the Tumen River water control project was held in Changchun City on the 6th. Signing the agreement were Shi Lun, representative of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power of the People's Republic of China, and Park Gyun-chae, representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Xu Yuanquan, Deputy Governor of Jilin Province, and Li Deji and Han Yinglong, secretaries of the Consulate General of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Changchun, also attended the signing ceremony.

The Tumen River water control project design book was prepared based on the relevant protocols and agreements jointly signed by the Chinese and North Korean governments on September 2, 1956, and October 8, 1957. Chinese and North Korean technicians and surveyors jointly conducted surveying and design work along the river between Shuaibawanzi Village and Xiwazi Village in Hunchun County, China, and between Hunrong-ri and Seungnyang-ri in North Hamgyong Province, North Korea, completing it ahead of schedule on December 18, 1957. This design book has been submitted to their respective governments for review and approval. According to the agreement, construction will officially begin after the representatives of the two countries sign the engineering design book, and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 1959.

The Tumen River is a river on the border between China and North Korea. The water flows rapidly, often impacting the river banks, causing river bends to change, land to collapse, making it unusable, and floods often become disasters. According to investigations, the floods in 1938 caused damage to 2,000 hectares of farmland along the riverbanks between Shuaibawanzi Village and Xiwazi Village in China and between Hunrong-ri and Seungnyang-ri in North Korea alone. Now, according to the design, a levee of 12.69 kilometers in length and some permanent bank protection and drainage projects will be built in this area. When this project is completed, the most harmful part of this river can be basically eradicated, and large areas of land and farmers along the coast of the two countries will benefit greatly.

### 中朝两国签订  关于图们江治水工程设计书的协议

    中朝两国签订
    关于图们江治水工程设计书的协议
    新华社长春7日电　中朝两国关于图们江治水工程设计书的协议签字仪式，6日在长春市举行。在协议书上签字的有：中华人民共和国水利电力部代表史轮、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国农业省代表朴均采。
    吉林省副省长徐元泉、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻长春领事馆秘书李德基、韩应龙等也出席签字仪式。
    图们江治水工程设计书是根据1956年9月2日和1957年10月8日中朝两国政府共同签订的有关议定书和协议书编制的。中朝两国的技术人员和测量工人，曾经共同在中国珲春县的甩湾子村到西崴子村间、朝鲜咸镜北道的训戎里至承良里间，沿江进行勘测和设计工作，于1957年12月18日提前完成。这项设计书已经各自报请本国政府审查批准。按照协定，两国代表在工程设计书上签字后就要正式开始施工，预定在1959年6月底前竣工。
    图们江是中朝两国边境上的一条河流，水流湍急，经常冲击河岸，使河套变迁，土地坍塌，无法利用，洪水往往泛滥成灾。据调查，1938年洪水泛滥，仅在中国的甩湾子村到西崴子村间、朝鲜的训戎里到承良里间沿河两岸农田受灾面积达两千公顷。现在依照设计将在这个地区修筑一条长达一二·六九公里的大堤和一些永久性的护岸、排水工程。当这项工程完成时，这条河流为害最大的部分，可以基本根治，两国大片土地和沿岸农民都将受到很大效益。
