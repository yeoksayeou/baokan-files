    A Young Actor's Wrong Path
    ——A Critique of the Erroneous Words and Deeds of the Actor Playing Dong Cunrui in the Movie "Dong Cunrui"
    Ding Hong, Anti-Enemy Drama Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    In the spring of 1956, when the movie "Dong Cunrui" was first released, Comrade Zhang Liang said in several articles and speeches that his performance still had many shortcomings. The film was loved by the audience mainly because of the noble qualities and heroic deeds of Comrade Dong Cunrui himself. If he himself could express some of the thoughts and feelings of this outstanding young Communist Party member, it was because he constantly learned from Dong Cunrui throughout the entire creative process, and also because of the education and cultivation of the Party and the army over the years, and the help of the entire production team. It should be said that this assessment was realistic for a young actor who came from a landlord family, lacked practical struggle experience, and was politically and professionally very naive. But, unfortunately, his words were not entirely sincere. In reality, he was complacent and thought he was great. After many articles of praise and encouragement were published in newspapers and periodicals, and schools and groups competed to invite him to lectures and get-togethers, and many young people kept writing letters of praise, he became even more dizzy with success, posing as a famous actor, even comparing himself to Dong Cunrui, as if he were also a heroic figure. So he began to look down on everyone. But pride makes one lag behind. In the past year or so, Zhang Liang, on the one hand, has delved into the small circle of personal fame and gain, pursuing enjoyment; on the other hand, he has arrogated himself as a famous actor and expert, expressing dissatisfaction with the Party's literary and artistic undertakings and the things around him, and began to disbelieve in the Party and disobey the Party's words. Thus, during the anti-rightist struggle last year, his many bourgeois ideological manifestations were exposed.

    Judging from Zhang Liang's several speeches, most of them were dissatisfied with the Party's literary and artistic policies and the army's literary and artistic work, showing his confusion and error in literary and artistic thought.

    We know that in the short few years since the founding of the country, my country's film industry has made great progress. However, Zhang Liang took a dismissive attitude towards these achievements. He said, "Too few domestic films are produced, and even fewer are good. I don't like to watch a domestic film when I hear it's one." How arrogant and ignorant this is!

    Although Zhang Liang verbally admitted the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work, he echoed the rightists' arguments on several issues, saying that "laymen cannot lead experts," that the Party's leadership in the army hindered artistic creation and development, and took some hearsay individual incidents as evidence to infer that there were too many laymen in the army, which affected the development of drama, resulting in little achievement. He advocated handing over the army's drama troupes. Here, Zhang Liang completely ignored the great achievements made by our army's literary and artistic work under the leadership of political organs at all levels, in implementing the working policy of "facing the company and serving the soldiers" and creating a large number of works reflecting the Chinese revolutionary war, as well as its development and improvement in practice, which is an important component of our country's revolutionary literary and artistic treasure house. So, why was Zhang Liang so averse to the Party's leadership over literary and artistic work in the army, and so enthusiastic about leaving the army to go to the local area? It turned out that he had a wishful thinking in his heart: he could both perform in big plays in theaters to become famous, and get high salaries. He said, "The army's drama troupe has great limitations in working in the army. It can't perform big plays in the grassroots, and small plays don't have good ones. At the same time, long-term touring performances in the army result in fewer new plays and slower improvement for actors." But what are his standards for excellent plays? It is "whatever plays are popular with the audience, that's what we perform." As for plays reflecting army life, "the leadership should not rigidly stipulate the proportion." In this way, Zhang Liang could often perform big plays in theaters in big cities to become famous, and at the same time make a profit. He said, "The salary system in our troupe is unreasonable. The basic salary system implemented by a certain troupe is much more reasonable than ours. Their leading actors, famous actors, and actors with great social influence have higher basic salaries and more bonuses, while ordinary young actors get less money. But some veteran comrades in our troupe are eating based on their qualifications." Obviously, Zhang Liang here does not classify himself as an ordinary young actor, but as a famous actor, leading actor, and actor with great social influence.

    In general, Zhang Liang's literary and artistic thoughts are very wrong and confused, and in many views, he is deeply influenced by bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts.

    Zhang Liang came from an exploiting family, but he joined the army at the age of fifteen and joined the Party at the age of eighteen. He has always grown up under the guidance of the Party and the revolutionary army. In principle, he should have developed a hard-working and simple revolutionary lifestyle. However, in the past year or so, that is, since he became famous, Zhang Liang has left all these good traditional styles behind and has become keen on fame and gain, greedy for enjoyment, and pursuing a bourgeois lifestyle. From his own confession and the exposure of his comrades, it can be explained that in recent years, Zhang Liang's original old consciousness has gradually risen, and he has been infected with and grown many bad things.

    He is very calculating about his personal selfish interests. He is even dissatisfied that his comrades occupy part of their rest time to rehearse plays due to revolutionary enthusiasm, saying that this is extra labor and should be paid overtime. It seems that Zhang Liang values money so much! How meticulously he calculates his "accounts"! It is a pity that his soul has been stained with the stench of money.

    The pursuit of a bourgeois lifestyle is also manifested in some of Zhang Liang's recent lifestyle habits and hobbies.

    Zhang Liang also behaved frivolously, vulgarly, and morally corruptly in his relations with men and women. He often used the communication relationship between a famous actor and the audience to give frivolous and ambiguous answers to letters from some female audience members in order to win other people's "love." As for dealing with individual women with frivolous styles, the words they used with each other were very corny, and there were even bad behaviors of playing with women. In a not very long time in the summer of last year, Zhang Liang changed his "love" object three times.

    Why did Zhang Liang produce the above-mentioned serious errors in his ideology and lifestyle? We believe that in addition to the bad influence of his exploiting family on his ideology and the fact that he has not been able to throw himself into the fiery struggle for strict training and ideological transformation since joining the army, the important reason is that he became famous after making a movie and became complacent.

    In the early stage of making the movie, Zhang Liang's general performance was still good, and he could still humbly learn from others. However, after the film and the role he played were welcomed and praised by the vast audience, Zhang Liang completely lost the humility that a Communist Party member should have. The leaders and comrades had repeatedly warned him to remain humble and not to be proud. He turned a deaf ear to all of them and was not vigilant at all. For example, once, an old comrade of our troupe sincerely advised him, but Zhang Liang said, "I have become famous, but I can't be without my humanity and personality. I can't pretend to be an adult." Zhang Liang treated the leaders' teachings and comrades' advice with such a proud attitude.

    After the movie "Dong Cunrui" was released, many young people wrote letters to Zhang Liang, some with encouragement and some with excessive praise. In those days, Zhang Liang's mind was completely dizzy, and he was immersed in those large numbers of "poems of praise" all day long, and he replied to every letter. He often forgot to eat and sleep. Sometimes, when individual young comrades expressed envy for his ability to receive so many letters every day, Zhang Liang always boasted, "This is still a lot, it's much less than the previous two days!" Look, how much complacency and arrogance is contained in this casual remark! No wonder that in public occasions (writing articles, giving speeches), he still had to say some insincere words of humility, but in individual contacts with some young people, he often compared himself to Dong Cunrui, boasting that he was a hero. This can be seen from some female students' letters to Zhang Liang. For example, one letter wrote: "From your speech, I know that you have permeated Dong Cunrui's noble qualities into your own life." Another letter also had such a sentence: "You said 'I am Dong Cunrui'..." In fact, how is Zhang Liang like Dong Cunrui? In addition, after the Beijing newspaper announced the list of the most popular actors among the audience in 1956, the radio station asked him to broadcast a thank-you message to the audience, and Zhang Liang took the opportunity to boast that he was the "most outstanding actor." Only after the leadership's review and discovery did they instruct him to change this statement.

    In addition, the most prominent and concentrated manifestation of his pride, complacency, and disregard for others was during this rectification movement, when comrades criticized his numerous erroneous thoughts and remarks, he was still full of arrogance, stubbornly adhered to his own views, and even took a satirical and hostile attitude towards others' opinions. Comrade Lu Dingyi said at the summary meeting of the criticism of the Ding and Chen anti-Party clique: "Because the working method of literary and art workers is a handicraft method, it is easy to produce individualism and liberalism; writers are also easy to become famous, and when they become famous, they are easy to become proud and complacent and become prisoners of the bourgeoisie." Zhang Liang is like this.

    When celebrating the October Socialist Revolution last year, the leadership did not allow Zhang Liang to participate in order to allow him to concentrate on conducting an in-depth self-criticism. This caused him great dissatisfaction, and he even wrote a letter questioning: "What impact will it have on public opinion if I am not allowed to participate in this performance!" This is such serious pride and complacency!

    It is precisely because of this serious pride and complacency that Zhang Liang has made many serious mistakes in his thinking, and even gone against the Party on individual issues, completely standing on the position of the bourgeois rightists. When the People's Daily reported the Sha Meng and Guo Wei anti-Party clique, Zhang Liang was very unconvinced, saying: "Currently, the newspaper reports too many messages about rightists. For example, the problem of Sha Meng and Guo Wei is labeled as monsters and demons, but the content is not much, and it is not clear what their program, plan, and words and deeds are." It seems that Zhang Liang is very reasonable, but for those rightists who want to overthrow the Party, dig up socialism, and let capitalism be restored, is it too much to say that they are monsters and demons? Why is Zhang Liang so affectionate and friendly to the rightists? It turned out that he believed that "bureaucracy is more harmful to socialism than imperialism!" He said: "There are two reasons for Sha Meng and Guo Wei's anti-Party behavior: one is personal fame and gain, and the other is bureaucracy. If the leadership does not have bureaucracy, it is impossible to produce rightists. As far as I know, the leadership of Changchun Film Studio has serious bureaucracy. Therefore, even without the instigation of Guo Wei and Sha Meng, others would petition. As for Guo Wei and Sha Meng, as Party members, it is not impossible to petition the Party." From this, it can be seen that Zhang Liang's tail is really raised too high, to the point that he lost his center of gravity, could not stand firmly, sympathized with the rightists' attacks, and rolled towards the bourgeoisie.

    Pride and complacency is an important reason for Zhang Liang's series of serious mistakes.

    Another reason, a profound lesson that we should pay special attention to in the future, is how the leadership should correctly understand and treat these young intellectuals who have achieved some success in literary and artistic work in the future. In the past, we had shortcomings in dealing with Zhang Liang's problem.

    First of all, for the leaders of our troupe, in the past, they were not vigilant enough. For a long time, they were satisfied with Comrade Zhang Liang's general performance (such as being young, innocent, hardworking, and enthusiastic), and did not pay enough attention to the old consciousness brought about by his class background, especially the pride and complacency that grew after he became famous. They only gave general education and general management (such as appropriately controlling external lectures, reviewing submissions and speech drafts, etc.), and did not systematically understand, study, and constantly educate him in other aspects in a focused manner. At the same time, they did not demand him strictly enough in terms of ideology, work, and life, and of course, there was even less talk of strengthening his training and transformation from labor and from going deep into practical struggles.

    Comrade Zhang Liang's problem also taught us how to strengthen ideological education and labor training for many young actors who have not undergone major tests and labor training in the future, especially how to criticize and eliminate their individualistic thoughts of pursuing fame and gain, which are relatively common in their minds, and establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly.

    Although Comrade Zhang Liang has not completely degenerated into a rightist like Liu Shaotang, he has reached a dangerous edge. His arrogance and ignorance, complacency in his achievements, thinking he is great, to the point of gradually alienating himself from the Party, etc., are very similar to Liu Shaotang. Since the anti-rightist movement, many young people like this have emerged. What is the reason for this? In addition to the influence of their original class consciousness and bourgeois ideas, as Comrade Lu Dingyi pointed out, "In recent years, a bad trend of unreservedly praising writers and young literary and art workers has emerged in society, which has fueled the bourgeois ideas and styles of some people." The excessive publicity and praise from society is indeed an important reason.

    It is precisely because of some of our inappropriate practices and excessive publicity, and even praise, that Zhang Liang, who originally had thoughts of fame and gain, became even more conceited. At the same time, these excessive publicity also made many young people who originally had enthusiasm and worship for heroes (of course, some of them were due to their vanity and naivety) simply regard Zhang Liang as a great heroic figure.

    From the problem of Comrade Zhang Liang, we have further realized the importance of Comrade Lu Dingyi's words: "In the future, the relevant leadership should learn from the lessons and completely eliminate this bad trend of praise, otherwise, it will continue to harm people."

    The above is only as our lesson. As for Comrade Zhang Liang himself, he should deeply recognize the seriousness of his mistakes, conduct a serious self-criticism, return to the embrace of the Party, and be determined to throw himself into the fiery struggle, undergo a thorough transformation, and transform himself.

    一个青年演员的歧路
    ——对电影“董存瑞”的扮演者的错误言行的批判
    中国人民解放军抗敌话剧团　丁洪
    1956年春天，电影“董存瑞”刚放映的时候，张良同志在几篇文章和几次讲话里都说，他的演出还有许多缺点，影片得到观众喜爱，主要是由于董存瑞同志的高贵品质和英雄行为本身太感人了；如果说他自己还能多少表现了一点这位优秀的青年共产党员的思想感情，那也是由于自己在整个创造过程中不断地向董存瑞学习的结果，同时，也是党和部队几年来对自己的教育培养和整个摄制组对自己的帮助的结果。应该说，对于一个出身于地主家庭、缺乏实际斗争锻炼、政治上和业务上都还十分幼稚的青年演员来说，这个估价是合乎实际的。但是，可惜得很，他的话并不完全是出于真心，实际上他是沾沾自喜，自以为了不起；在报刊上陆续刊载许多表扬鼓励的文章，各学校团体争相邀请讲演联欢，许多青年不断地来信赞扬以后，他更加冲昏头脑，俨然以名演员自居，甚至把自己和董存瑞相提并论，仿佛自己也就是一个英雄人物了。于是他开始目空一切起来。但是，骄傲使人落后。一年多来，张良一方面钻进了个人名利的小圈子，追求享受；另一方面又以名演员、专家自封，对党的文艺事业和周围事物表示不满，并且开始不相信党和不听党的话。这样，在去年反右派斗争的时候，他的许多资产阶级思想表现就暴露出来了。
    从张良的若干次发言来看，大部分是对党的文艺政策和部队文艺工作的不满，表现出他的文艺思想的混乱和错误。
    我们知道，在开国以来的短短几年里，我国的电影事业有了很大的发展。可是张良对这些成绩采取了一笔抹煞的态度。他说：“国产片出的太少，好的就更少。我一听说是国产片就不爱看。”这是多么狂妄和无知！
    张良虽然口头上承认党对文学艺术工作的领导，但是在若干问题上，却跟右派分子的论调相同，说什么“外行不能领导内行”，军队党的领导妨碍了艺术的创造和发展，并把若干道听途说来的个别事件当做根据，推论说部队外行太多，影响了话剧的发展，以致成绩很小。他主张把部队话剧团交出去。这里，张良完全忽视我军文艺工作在各级政治机关的领导下，在贯彻执行“面向连队，为兵服务”的工作方针和创作反映中国革命战争的大量作品等等方面，所获得的重大成绩，以及在实践中的发展与提高，而这些正是我国革命的文学艺术宝库中重要的一个组成部分。那么，为什么张良这样反感军队党对文艺工作的领导，而又那样热衷于脱离部队到地方去呢？原来他心中有一个如意算盘：既可以在剧院里演大戏出名，又可以拿高薪。他说：“部队话剧团在部队工作局限性大，排大戏下不去，排小戏又没有好的。同时在部队长期巡回演出，新剧目产生就少，演员提高就慢。”可是他的优秀剧目的标准是什么呢？是“什么戏受观众欢迎就排什么戏。”至于反映部队生活的剧目，“领导上不应该硬性规定比例数。”这样，张良便可以经常在大城市的剧场里演出大戏而出名，同时还可以获利。他说：“薪金制在我团不合理，某某剧团实行的基薪制就比我们合理得多。他们的主角、名演员、社会影响大的，基薪就多，分红也多，一般青年演员拿的钱就少。可是我们团有些老同志却是凭资格吃饭。”显然，张良在这里并不是把自己划为一般的青年演员，而是名演员、主角、社会影响大的演员了。
    总起来说，张良的文艺思想是十分错误和混乱的，在许多观点上受资产阶级文艺思想的影响很深。
    张良出身于剥削家庭，但是他十五岁就参加了军队，十八岁入了党，一直是在党和革命部队的教导下长大成人，按理他应该养成艰苦朴素的革命生活作风，可是在近一年多以来，也就是出了名以来，张良却把这些好的传统作风一起丢在脑后，变得热衷名利，贪图享受，追求起资产阶级的生活方式。从他本人的交代和同志们的揭发中，可以说明近年来张良原有的若干旧意识已逐渐抬头，并且沾染了和滋长了许多坏的东西。
    他十分计较个人私利小算盘。他连同志们由于革命热情而占用部分休息时间来排戏也不满意，说这是额外劳动，应该发给加班费。看来张良对于钱是多么重视！他的“账”又算得多么精细！可惜他的灵魂已经染上铜臭了。
    追求资产阶级的生活方式同时也表现在张良近年来的某些生活习惯和生活趣味上。
    张良在男女关系上，也表现得轻浮、庸俗和道德败坏。他经常利用一个名演员和观众的通信联系关系，对于有些女观众来信给以轻佻暧昧的回答，以骗取别人的“爱情”。至于对待个别作风轻浮的妇女，则彼此的词句都写得十分肉麻，甚至还有玩弄妇女的恶劣行为。在去年夏季的一个不太长的时间里，张良便三次更换“恋爱”对象。
    为什么张良在思想上、生活作风上会产生以上那些严重的错误？我们以为除了他的剥削家庭所给予他思想意识的若干坏的影响，而参军以后又一直没有能够投入到火热的斗争中去进行严格的锻炼和思想改造以外，重要的原因，就是由于拍了电影，成了名，就翘起尾巴来了。
    张良在拍电影的初期，一般表现还好，还能虚心向别人学习，而在影片和他所扮演的角色获得广大观众的欢迎和赞扬以后，张良就完全丧失了一个共产党员应有的谦虚的美德，领导上和同志们曾再三告诫他要保持谦虚，千万不要骄傲。他都置若罔闻，毫无警惕。比如有一次，我团一个老同志曾非常诚恳地劝导他，可是张良却说：“我出了名，也不能就没有我的人性和个性。我不能装大人。”张良就是以这样骄傲的态度来对待领导对他的教导和同志们对他的劝告。
    在电影“董存瑞”上演以后，许多青年都给张良写信来，其中有鼓励，也有过份的颂扬。那些日子，张良的头脑完全昏了，整天沉湎在那些大量的“赞美诗”里，并且每信必回。经常废寝忘飧。有时，当个别青年同志对他每天能收到这样多的来信表示羡慕时，张良却总是炫耀地说：“这还算多，比前两天少多了！”看，这句轻描淡写的话语里，包藏着多少得意和傲慢！无怪乎他在公开的场合（写文章、做讲演）虽然还不得不言不由衷地说些谦虚的词句，但是在和一些青年人的个别接触中，都常常把自己比做董存瑞，吹嘘自己是英雄。这可以从一些女学生给张良的来信中看出。比如有一封信里这样写道：“从您的讲话中，知道您已把董存瑞的高贵品质贯串在自己的生活中。”另一封信中也有这样一句话：“您说‘我是董存瑞’……”其实，张良哪一点像董存瑞呢？另外，在北京报纸公布了1956年观众最喜欢的几个演员的名单之后，电台请他向观众作答谢广播，张良便乘机吹嘘自己是“最优秀的演员”，经领导审查发现，才嘱其改换这样的说法。
    此外最突出和集中地表现他的骄傲自满，目中无人，是在此次整风运动中同志们对他的若干错误思想言论进行批判的时候，他还是傲气十足，固执己见，甚至对别人的意见采取讽刺和敌对的态度。陆定一同志在批判丁、陈反党集团的总结大会上说：“因为文艺家的工作方式是手工业的方式，容易产生个人主义和自由主义思想；作家又容易出名，出了名，就容易骄傲自满，成为资产阶级的俘虏。”张良正是这样。
    去年庆祝十月社会主义革命演出时，领导上为了让张良集中精力进行深入地检查，没有让他参加。这引起他很大的不满，甚至写信质问：“不允许我参加这次演出，将给社会舆论带来什么影响！”这又是多么严重的骄傲自满！
    正是由于这种严重的骄傲自满，使得张良在思想上犯了许多严重的错误，甚至在个别问题上和党背道而驰，完全站到资产阶级右派的立场上去了。当人民日报报道了沙蒙、郭维反党集团后，张良颇为不服，说：“目前报纸上报道右派分子的消息，骂得太多了。如沙蒙、郭维的问题，标题上是牛鬼蛇神，但内容不多，看不明白他们有什么纲领、计划、言行。”看来张良似乎很讲道理，但是对于那些想推翻党、挖掉社会主义、以便让资本主义复辟的右派分子，难道说他个牛鬼蛇神还太重了吗？为什么张良对右派分子如此情重谊深？原来是他认为“官僚主义对社会主义的危害比帝国主义还严重！”他说：“造成沙蒙、郭维他们反党的原因有二：一是个人名利思想，二是官僚主义。如果领导上没有官僚主义，就不可能产生右派分子。据我了解，长影领导上就有严重的官僚主义。因此，即使没有郭维、沙蒙的煽动，别人也会去请愿的。至于郭维、沙蒙，作为党员，向党请愿，也未尝不可。”由此可以看出，张良的尾巴实在翘得太高了，以至使他失掉重心，站立不稳，去同情右派的进攻，滚向资产阶级那边去了。
    骄傲自满是使张良产生一系列严重错误的一个重要原因。
    另一个原因，我们今后应该特别引起警惕的深刻的教训，就是领导方面今后应该如何正确的认识和对待这些在文艺工作上稍有成绩的知识青年。过去我们在对待张良的问题上是有缺点的。
    首先，对我团领导来说，过去警惕不高，长时期以来，满足于张良同志的一般表现（如年轻、天真、努力、积极热情），而对其阶级出身所带来的旧意识，特别是成名以后所滋长的骄傲自满，未予以足够的重视，只是一般的教育和一般的管理（如适当控制外出讲演，审查投稿及讲话底稿等），没有重点地对其他各方面进行系统的了解、研究和经常进行教育。同时在思想、业务和生活方面，对他要求得也不够严格，当然更谈不到从劳动中、从深入实际斗争中来加强对他的锻炼和改造了。
    张良同志的问题，也教训了我们今后对待许多未经重大考验及劳动锻炼的青年演员，应该如何加强思想教育和劳动锻炼，特别是如何批判和清除他们思想中比较普遍存在的追求名利的个人主义思想，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想。
    虽然，张良同志还没有完全堕落到像刘绍棠一样成为右派分子，但是已经到了危险的边缘了。他的狂妄无知，稍有成绩便居功骄傲，自以为了不起，以至和党逐渐疏远起来等等方面，倒是十分和刘绍棠相似。反右运动以来，像这样的青年人已经出现不少。这是什么原故呢？这除了他们原有的阶级意识和资产阶级思想的影响外，正如陆定一同志所指出的，“近年来社会上出现了一种对作家和青年文艺工作者一味捧场的恶劣风气，它助长了一些人的资产阶级的思想和作风。”社会上对他的过多的宣扬与捧场确实是一个重要的原因。
    正是由于我们某些不恰当的做法和过份的宣扬，甚至捧场，就进一步促使这个本来就具有名利思想的张良更加以为自己了不起了。同时，这些过份的宣扬也使得不少本来就具有对于英雄的热情崇拜的青年（当然其中部分人是由于他们的虚荣心和幼稚无知），简直把张良当成了伟大的英雄人物。
    从张良同志的问题来看，我们更加体会到了陆定一同志的话的重要性：“今后有关的领导方面，应该接受教训，彻底消除这种恶劣的捧场风气，否则，还会继续害人”。
    以上只是作为我们的教训来说的，至于张良同志自己，却应该深刻认识自己错误的严重性，认真进行检查，重新回到党的怀抱里来，并下定决心，投入火热的斗争中去，脱胎换骨，改造自己。
