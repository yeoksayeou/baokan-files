Xinhua News Agency, Accra, April 18th: According to a communiqué released this afternoon, the African Independent States Conference today concluded its discussion of the first agenda item and reached a consensus agreement on the various issues discussed.

The conference secretary-general, Ghana's Adu, said at a press conference after the closed-door plenary session that, as with the earlier discussions on general foreign policy and the Algerian question, the conference had reached a consensus on the issues of racial problems and measures to safeguard the independent sovereignty of African independent states. He predicted that the conference might end before the scheduled date of April 23.

He said that under the topic of the future of African dependencies, issues such as Kenya, the Central African Federation, and Nyasaland were discussed.

The conference will continue to discuss other items on the agenda on the 19th. The next agenda item is on the economic cooperation between African countries.

The London-based Committee of African Organizations telegraphed the conference, requesting it to protest the arrest of African leaders by the British authorities in Kenya.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, April 18th: This morning, Dr. Moumié, president of the Cameroon People's Union, said at a press conference that when he presented the Cameroon issue to the conference yesterday, he had requested the conference to provide material and moral support to the people of Cameroon who are striving for independence and unification.

The leader of the Cameroon national movement also reviewed the history of Cameroon. He said that Cameroon is currently under the rule of Britain and France due to the United Nations' decision in 1946, despite the fact that the trusteeship agreement states that the purpose of the trusteeship is to grant autonomy and independence.

Moumié said that the guerrilla warfare that began in the French-administered part of Cameroon in 1956 is still ongoing. French Cameroon is currently in a state of true war. French and other national newspapers predict that this war will soon turn Cameroon into a second Algeria. He said that this conference, which advocates maintaining peace, has a responsibility to stop the bloodshed in order to help those who are fighting for independence and freedom.

    在种族问题和保障独立主权问题上
    非洲国家会议取得一致意见
    喀麦隆民族运动领袖要求支持喀麦隆独立斗争
    据新华社阿克拉18日电　据今天下午发表的公报说，非洲独立国家会议今天结束了对第一项议程的讨论，并且对讨论的各项问题达成一致的协议。
    会议秘书长、加纳的阿杜在全体秘密会议结束后举行记者招待会说，在种族问题和保障非洲独立国家的独立主权的措施问题上，跟在早先关于总的外交政策和阿尔及利亚问题的讨论一样，会议取得了一致意见。他预料会议可能在预定的4月23日以前结束。
    他说，在非洲附属国前途的这个议题下，讨论了怯尼亚、中非联邦、尼亚萨兰等问题。
    会议在19日将继续讨论议程的其他项目。下一个议程是关于非洲国家间经济合作的问题。
    伦敦非洲组织委员会打电报给会议，要求会议就怯尼亚英国当局逮捕非洲领袖一事提出抗议。
    新华社阿克拉18日电　今天早晨，喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃（前译莫米）博士在记者招待会上说，他昨天在向会议提出喀麦隆问题的时候，已经要求会议给予争取独立和统一的喀麦隆人民以物质的和道义的支持。
    这位喀麦隆民族运动领袖还回顾了喀麦隆的历史。他说，由于联合国1946年的决定，喀麦隆目前仍处在英法两国统治之下；尽管托管协定中说，托管的目的是为了给予自治和独立。
    穆米埃说，1956年在喀麦隆法属部分开始的游击战争目前仍在进行。法属喀麦隆目前处于真正的战争状态中。法国和其他国家报纸预言，这场战争不久将使喀麦隆成为第二个阿尔及利亚。他说，主张维护和平的这次会议有责任制止流血事件，以帮助那些正在为争取独立和自由而斗争的人们。
