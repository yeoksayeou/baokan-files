    Clock and Watch Repair Service
    Among the red and green big-character posters filling the courtyard, I discovered an "advertisement" from the Beijing First Clock and Watch Repair Production Cooperative. This cooperative decided to send someone to our place every Friday from 12:00 noon to 1:30 PM, while comrades were still off work, to collect clocks and watches for repair. They also offered four points: pick-up and delivery; for urgent repairs, you can call and they will send someone to pick up the watch promptly; guaranteed quality, and timely completion. The repair items include: "Swimming watches, automatic watches, pocket watches, balance wheel watches, automatic calendar watches, aviation watches, car clocks, antique Western clocks, various alarm clocks, record players... and 26 other types." In a word, they repair almost everything. This is truly a new phenomenon emerging from the Great Leap Forward!

    接修钟表
    在满院子的红红绿绿的一片大字报中，我发现一张北京市第一钟表修理生产合作社的“广告”。这个合作社决定每星期五中午十二时至一时半趁同志们还没上班时，派专人到我们这里来接修钟表。还提出四点：管取管送；急用的表坏了，可以电话通知，及时来人取修；保证质量，定期不误。修理的项目有：“游泳表、自动表、怀表、马针表、日历自动表、航空表、汽车表、古老洋钟、各式闹钟、唱机……等二十六种”。一句话，几乎是无所不修。这真是大跃进中出现的新气象！
