    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 4th. Prime Minister Nehru stated at a press conference this morning that he welcomes the Soviet government's statement on ceasing nuclear weapons testing. He said, "Of course, we welcome it. We are happy about it."

    Nehru said, "As far as we are concerned, since the beginning of atomic testing, we have been very concerned about such tests. Since that time, we have been earnestly requesting that such tests not be conducted. We feel that with each test, the atmosphere is polluted once, and the danger is increased by a layer."

    He then said that, therefore, "the Soviet government's announcement, regardless of what conditions may be attached, is always welcome."

    Nehru said, "I can never understand why there is unwillingness to stop nuclear testing for a period of time," "Stopping the tests for a period of time will not endanger the security of any country, and will therefore gain time to solve the problem in a new and better atmosphere."

    When Nehru spoke of the Western claim of so-called "secret tests," he said, "The best guarantee is to stop the tests and appoint a committee composed of the world's best scientists to supervise."

    In answering a question about the issue of West German forces being supplied with nuclear weapons, Nehru said that India regrets very much that the number of countries possessing nuclear weapons is increasing.

    尼赫鲁希望停止核试验
    对苏联的声明表示欢迎
    新华社新德里4日电　尼赫鲁总理今天上午在记者招待会上表示欢迎苏联政府关于停止核武器试验的声明，他说：“当然我们欢迎它。我们为它感到高兴。”
    尼赫鲁说：“就我们而论，自从原子试验开始以来，我们就对这种试验非常担心。从那时候起，我们一直在恳切要求不进行这种试验。我们觉得，每试验一次，大气就会污染一次，危险就会加重一层。”
    他接着说，因此，“苏联政府的宣布，不管可能附有什么条件，总是值得欢迎的。”
    尼赫鲁说：“我永远不能理解为什么不愿意停止核试验一个时候那种做法”，“把试验停止一个时期，并不会危害任何国家的安全，而会因此得到时间来在新的和较好的气氛中解决问题”。
    尼赫鲁在谈到西方所谓会举行“秘密试验”的说法时说，“最好的保证办法是停止试验和任命一个由世界最优秀的科学家组成的委员会来进行监督”。
    尼赫鲁在回答关于西德军队得到核武器供应的问题时说，印度对于得到核武器的国家的数目增多这件事感到非常遗憾。
