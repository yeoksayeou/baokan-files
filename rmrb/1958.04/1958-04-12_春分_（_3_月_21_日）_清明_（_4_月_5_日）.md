	"Vernal Equinox" (March 21st) - "Qingming" (April 5th)
	Between the "Vernal Equinox" and "Qingming," wheat in the Yangtze River basin has already begun to head, and wheat in the Yellow River and Huai River basins has mostly started to joint. In southern areas, rapeseed is generally in full bloom and podding during this period. Strengthening field management of these crops remains one of the important tasks in various summer-ripening crop production areas. In late March, various regions of Jiangsu Province continued to launch a crash program to cultivate wheat. In Huimin Prefecture, Shandong Province, in the eight days from late March to early April, the entire prefecture irrigated 660,000 mu of wheat, hoed 730,000 mu of wheat, and top-dressed 500,000 mu. Various regions in Shaanxi are also continuing to carry out frost prevention, pest control and other work, striving to eliminate about 10% of the third-class wheat.
	During this period, some summer-ripening crop production areas experienced frost, and a small number of wheat seedlings in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and other provinces have been damaged by frost. Individual counties in Guizhou and small areas in Hubei and Hunan suffered hail damage to wheat and rapeseed. In some areas of Fujian and other provinces, wheat and barley have begun to mature, following Guangdong.
	In the later stage of this period, most of the early rice in the Yangtze River basin has been sown, and the early rice seedlings in southern areas of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces have mostly been transplanted into the fields. This year, rice transplanting in these areas has generally progressed rapidly. Making every effort to improve labor efficiency is an important reason for the rapid progress of rice transplanting this year.
	Before "Qingming," some of the early transplanted rice seedlings had already turned green.
	Some counties in Neijiang Prefecture and Mianyang Prefecture, Sichuan, began planting cotton in late March, and those who started early had finished planting by the end of March. Some areas in Hubei and other provinces also began cotton planting before "Qingming."
	Northern cotton-producing areas are carrying out cotton planting preparations. Xinxiang, a major cotton-producing county in Henan, had plowed and harrowed more than 200,000 mu of cotton fields by early April, and most of the cotton seeds had undergone particle selection and germination tests.
	Although most areas in the Yellow River and Huai River basins experienced another spring rain in late March and early April, the rainfall was not significant in most areas. Hebei, Gansu, Qinghai and other provinces are still under varying degrees of drought threat. These drought-stricken areas are tensely deploying efforts to overcome drought and strive for timely sowing.
	Sichuan, Guangxi and other provinces experienced rain successively before "Qingming." This rain greatly alleviated the drought in Sichuan, and most areas in Guangxi saw rain, but the rainfall distribution was uneven.

### “春分”（3月21日）——“清明”（4月5日）

    “春分”（3月21日）——“清明”（4月5日）
    在“春分”“清明”之间，长江流域的小麦已经抽穗，黄河、淮河流域的小麦也大部开始拔节。南方地区的油菜，在这个时期正普遍盛花结荚。加强这些作物的田间管理，仍是各夏熟作物产区的重要任务之一。江苏省各地在3月底继续突击培育三麦。山东省惠民专区在3月底4月初的八天中，全区浇小麦六十六万亩，锄麦七十三万亩，追肥五十万亩。陕西各地也在继续进行防冻、治虫等工作，争取消灭约10％的三类麦。
    在这个阶段里，一些夏熟作物产区出现过霜冻，江苏、陕西、山西等省的少数麦苗已受到冻害。贵州个别县和湖北、湖南少数地区的小麦、油菜受到雹灾。福建等省一些地区的大、小麦，继广东之后开始成熟。
    在这个阶段后期，长江流域的早稻已大部下种，广东、广西、福建等省南部地区的早稻秧苗多数已插到田里。这些地区今年插秧普遍进展迅速。千方百计提高劳动效率，是今年插秧进度快的一个重要原因。
    在“清明”以前，部分早插的稻秧已经转青。
    四川内江专区和绵阳专区的一些县，在3月下旬就开始播种棉花工作，动手早的地区，到3月底已播种完了。湖北等省的一些地区也在“清明”前开始了棉花播种工作。
    北方棉产区正在进行播棉准备工作。河南主要产棉县新乡，到4月初已把二十多万亩棉田整耙好了，大部棉种都经过了粒选和发芽试验。
    3月底4月初，黄河淮河流域大部地区虽然又下了一次春雨，但是多数地区雨量不大。河北、甘肃、青海等省仍在不同程度的干旱威胁中。这些干旱地区正在紧张地部署战胜干旱，争取适时播种。
    四川、广西等省在“清明”前相继下了雨。这一场雨大大减轻了四川的干旱现象，广西多数地区见雨，但雨量分布不匀。
