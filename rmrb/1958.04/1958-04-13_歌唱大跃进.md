“Every year during the New Year, I sing songs,
This year, there are so many folk songs,
Ten thousand new things in the countryside,
Sing this one, then forget that one."

In the upsurge of the socialist Great Leap Forward, folk songs and ballads, which have always been the most capable of expressing the people's emotions, have emerged in large numbers throughout the country. This ballad, published in the "Jinggangshan Daily," vividly describes this moving scene.

The China Folk Literature Research Association recently collected nearly two thousand folk songs and ballads singing the Great Leap Forward, totaling more than 14,000 lines, from just over 240 newspapers, periodicals, a few local pamphlets, and factory big-character posters. At present, they are actively compiling and selecting the first and second collections of "Folk Songs of the Great Leap Forward" for publication as a gift for this year's May 1st International Labor Day. Many provinces and counties have promptly compiled these mass creations into small booklets. The Ministry of Culture attaches great importance to this and has recently notified all provinces, cities, and counties to widely and deeply collect these valuable mass creations in order to further encourage the revolutionary spirit and labor enthusiasm of the masses.

The thousands upon thousands of folk creations from the people, depicting the revolutionary drive of the masses, praising the leadership of the Party, and singing the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program, have shaken many writers and poets. They believe that these creations vividly reflect the voice of the era's leap forward and the overwhelming revolutionary momentum of the workers and peasants.

"There is no Jade Emperor in heaven,
There is no Dragon King on earth,
I am the Jade Emperor,
I am the Dragon King,
Commanding the Three Mountains and Five Ridges to open the way,
Here I come!"
This is the bold declaration of Shaanxi farmers.

"The youth's energy rivals Zhao Yun,
The adults' strength rivals Wu Song,
Children are like Luo Cheng,
The elderly work like Huang Zhong,
Cadres plan better than Zhuge Liang,
Women surpass Mu Guiying."
This is how Henan farmers describe their revolutionary drive.

"Leap forward, leap forward again,
We are determined to fight hard for three years,
Rolling on the tiger's back,
Catching eagles in the clouds."
"Men and women mobilize together,
Young and old work as one,
Blocking the water in the sky,
Digging out the springs underground;
Angering the Dragon King until he stares,
Scaring the Land God until he trembles!"
Farmers in Hunan, Shanxi, and other places sing out their determination and pride in fearing nothing.

Farmers in Yunnan, where folk songs are prevalent, express their leaping mood in more detail:
"The carrying pole is thick, long and long,
One end tied with a big earthen basket,
When carrying, only dislike the earthen basket is small,
Just want to move the mountain at once."

A betrothed couple in Longtai Township, Wushan County, Gansu, sing such new love songs to each other:
"The river water in the ditch races like a horse,
Brother is like Yang Zongbao,
Able to kill and fight in Luolong Valley,
I love my brother's high aspirations."
"Hearing my sister praise me,
My whole body gains strength again.
Yesterday I saw you from afar,
What are you thinking about looking at the river?"...
"Calling out to sister, work harder,
Let's strive to be models,
Zhongliang Canal is opened, water reaches the mountain,
Let's meet at the Hero Conference."
"Calling out to brother, rest assured,
I am not a backward person either.
I won't see you if I don't become a model,
I won't marry until the water goes up the mountain."

The people of Inner Mongolia sing even more humorously about their yearning for a happy life in the countryside:
"Green mountains and clear waters, a single ditch,
A clear spring flows outward,
What fell down?
Suddenly look up,
A big red apple falls into the mouth."

Living in this torrent of the socialist Great Leap Forward, people can't help but sing the Forty Articles, can't help but sing the Party's leadership. "A thousand-year-old bald mountain is covered in green, Ten thousand acres of mountain land grow rice, The mountains laugh, the land laughs, The Forty Articles pave a broad road." "It is difficult to rain without clouds in the sky, It is difficult to take root without soil on the ground, If farmers leave collectivization, It is difficult to turn over even if they break their bones." (Sichuan) "Golden grains of rice, golden and golden, Every household comes to taste the new, Who told us to organize cooperatives? Who told us to get a good harvest? Who made us have enough food and clothing? The Party's kindness is as deep as the sea." (Guangdong)

The poet Yuan Shuipai recently said when discussing the compilation of "Folk Songs of the Great Leap Forward" that these poems from the masses have taken a step ahead of writers in creation, are very closely integrated with the current political movement, and many excellent works are worthy of writers bowing down before them. Compiling and printing these folk songs and ballads will greatly promote the creation of poetry in our country. It will become a reference for writers and help solve the long-standing problem of poets going deep into the masses and the popularization of creation.

    歌唱大跃进
    新华社记者　续磊
    “年年过年我唱歌，今年山歌实在多，农村新事千万桩，唱了这个丢那个。”
    在社会主义大跃进的热潮中，一向最能抒发群众激情的民谣民歌在全国各地大量地涌现出来。这首刊登在“井冈山报”上的歌谣，生动地描写了这一动人的景象。
    中国民间文艺研究会最近仅仅从两百四十多种报刊和少数地方小册子、工厂大字报中就汇集到了近两千首、一万四千多行的歌唱大跃进的民谣民歌。目前他们正在积极整理选辑出版“大跃进民谣选”第一、二集，作为今年“五一”国际劳动节的献礼。许多省、县都及时地把这些群众创作的歌谣编成小册子。文化部对此极为重视，最近已通知全国各省、市、县广泛深入地收集这些宝贵的群众创作，以进一步鼓舞群众的革命干劲和劳动热情。
    出自民间的千千万万首描写群众革命干劲、歌颂党的领导、歌唱农业发展纲要四十条的群众创作，震动了很多作家和诗人们。他们认为，这些创作生动地反映了时代跃进的声音和工农群众排山倒海的革命气势。
    “天上没有玉皇，地下没有龙王，我就是玉皇，我就是龙王，喝命三山五岭开道，我来了！”这是陕西农民发出的豪语。
    “青年劲头赛赵云，壮年力气赛武松，少年儿童像罗成，老人干活似黄忠，干部策划胜诸葛，妇女赛过穆桂英。”这是河南农民描绘他们的革命干劲。
    “跃进跃进再跃进，苦战三年有决心，老虎背上打得滚，半天云里捉得鹰。”“男女总动员，老少一齐干，拦着天上水，挖出地下泉；气得龙王干瞪眼，吓得土地打战战！”湖南、山西等地农民就是这样歌唱出他们不怕一切的决心和自豪感。
    盛行民谣的云南农民更细致地抒发他们跃进的心情：“扁担粗粗长又长，一头拴个大土篮，挑时只嫌土篮小，只想一下搬动山。”
    甘肃武山县龙台乡一对未婚夫妇对唱着这样的新情歌：“沟里河水赛马跑，哥哥好比杨宗保，能杀能战落龙沟，我爱哥哥志气高。”“听见妹妹把我夸，浑身又把力气加。昨日老远望见你，你望河水想什么？”……“叫声妹妹加油干，咱俩争取当模范，中梁渠通水上山，群英会上好见面。”“叫声哥哥你放心，我也不是落后人。不当模范不见你，水不上山不结婚。”
    内蒙古人民更风趣地唱出了对农村幸福生活的向往：“青山绿水一道沟，一股清泉往外流，什么东西掉下来？猛抬头，大红苹果掉在嘴里头。”
    生活在这社会主义大跃进的洪流里，人们禁不住要歌唱四十条，禁不住要歌唱党的领导。“千年秃山披绿袄，万顷山地长水稻，山也笑，地也笑，四十条铺起康庄道。”“天上无云难下雨，地下无土难扎根，农民离了合作化，挣断骨头难翻身。”（四川）“金黄谷粒黄金金，家家户户来尝新，谁人叫俺组织社？谁人叫俺得丰收？谁人使俺衣食足？党的恩情似海深。”
                      （广东）
    诗人袁水拍最近在讨论编选“大跃进民谣选”时说，这些来自群众的诗歌在创作上比作家走前了一步，同当前政治运动结合得非常紧密，许多优秀作品，值得作家拜倒在他们面前。把这些民谣民歌整理编印出来，对我国诗歌创作将会起很大的促进作用，它会成为作家的借鉴，有助于解决长期以来未能解决的诗人深入群众中去和创作群众化的问题。
