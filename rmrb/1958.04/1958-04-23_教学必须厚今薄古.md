Teaching Must Emphasize the Present and De-emphasize the Past
Bǎi Shēng

Recently, teachers and students in higher education institutions across the country have launched criticisms and debates on the phenomenon of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present in teaching. Departments such as Chinese, History, and Philosophy at Peking University have exposed a large number of facts about emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present in teaching, and its serious harm to teaching work.

“Emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past” and “emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present” represent two different paths in teaching ideology, and we must carry out this ideological struggle to the end in order to promote a great leap forward in teaching work.

Why does the phenomenon of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present still seriously exist in the teaching work of our higher education institutions today? Why are teachers only enthusiastic about the things of the ancients and appreciating the artistic conceptions of characters in ancient books in their teaching, while being indifferent to the great changes in our society today, to the heroic achievements of the people today, and to the many major issues in our socialist construction today? Tracing the roots, it is nothing more than the influence of bourgeois teaching ideology, which seeks to escape reality, advocates scholarship for the sake of scholarship, and does not think about using scholarship to serve socialism. This kind of thinking also profoundly reflects the fact that teachers’ positions, viewpoints, thoughts, and feelings have not been thoroughly transformed.

This kind of bourgeois teaching ideology of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present, which is divorced from reality, has already brought great harm to teaching work and students' thinking. It not only makes some courses detached from the current socialist reality, but also seriously fosters the unhealthy thoughts and feelings of escaping from real-life struggles among young students. For example, some students, after studying the works of Zhuangzi and Tao Yuanming, become immersed in that kind of ethereal and otherworldly realm. Some students are single-mindedly thinking of following the path of teachers in academic research, only wanting to do tedious textual research in old paper piles, and are unwilling to learn and study problems in connection with current real life.

In teaching, some teachers instruct students not to pay too much attention to the discussions in current newspapers and magazines, saying that learning must be distanced from the real struggle and cannot always be combined with reality. This has had a great impact on students. What kind of thinking is this? Isn't this clearly guiding students to detach themselves from the real struggle? This is neither a socialist teaching method nor a socialist teaching attitude. Our teaching work must face reality and must be combined with reality. The purpose of learning from the ancients is also to serve the people of today.

There are also teachers who instruct students when studying history, saying that chronology, geography, official positions, and catalogs are the four keys to learning Chinese history, but they do not mention a single word about class struggle—the most critical key to learning history. Isn't this also clearly encouraging students to bury themselves in tedious textual research and piles of materials? They completely ignore the purpose, position, viewpoint, and method of historical research. Where will this lead students?

This tendency to bury oneself in old paper piles, emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present, and being divorced from reality and politics, is a dangerous tendency. Under the guidance of this kind of teaching ideology, the students cultivated will be bookworms at best, and those with serious cases will be full of feudal ideas and bourgeois ideas, and will never be socialist intellectuals who are both cultured and love labor. We advise the teachers who emphasize the past and de-emphasize the present to thoroughly clean up this habitual bourgeois thinking in your teaching, to have a great revolution in teaching ideology, to transform your position, viewpoint, thoughts, and feelings, and to resolutely implement the policy of emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past. Only in this way can you become both red and expert.

    教学必须厚今薄古
    柏生
    最近，各地高等学校的师生对教学中的厚古薄今现象，都展开了批判和论战。北京大学中文、历史、哲学等系，揭露了教学中大量的厚古薄今的事实，和它对教学工作的严重危害。
      “厚今薄古”和“厚古薄今”，这是教学思想上两条道路的一场大辩论，我们必须把这场思想斗争进行到底，才能促进教学工作的大跃进。
    为什么今天在我们的高等学校的教学工作中，还严重地存在着厚古薄今的现象呢？为什么教师们在教课中只津津乐道于古人的东西和欣赏古书中的人物意境，而对于今天我国社会的伟大变化，对于今天人民群众的英雄业迹，对于今天我国社会主义建设中的许多重大问题，无动于衷呢？追其根源不外是资产阶级的教学思想作祟，想逃避现实，提倡为学术而学术，没有想把学术用来为社会主义服务。这种思想也深刻地反映着教师的立场、观点、思想和感情未彻底获得改造的情况。
    这种资产阶级的脱离实际的厚古薄今的教学思想，已经给教学工作和学生思想上带来很大的危害。它不但使有些课程脱离当前社会主义的现实生活，而且使青年学生的思想也严重地滋长了逃避现实斗争和不健康的思想感情。如有些学生学了庄子和陶渊明的作品，就沉溺于那种虚无飘渺和世外桃源的境界。有些学生则一心想走老师研究学问的道路，只想在故纸堆中做烦琐的考据，而不愿联系当前的现实生活进行学习和研究问题。
    在教学中，由于有的教师指导学生不要过多地注意当前报纸杂志上的讨论，说学习就得跟现实斗争有距离，不能老结合实际。这使学生受了很大的影响。这是一种什么思想呢？这不明明是引导学生脱离现实斗争吗？这既不是社会主义的教学方法，也不是社会主义的教学态度。我们的教学工作必须面对现实，必须结合实际，学古人学问的目的，也是要用来为今人服务的。
    还有的教师指导学生学历史时说，年代、地理、官职、目录这是学习中国史的四把钥匙，而对阶级斗争——这把学历史的最关键的钥匙，却根本一字不提。这不也是明明鼓励学生要埋头到烦琐的考据和资料堆中去吗？对研究历史的目的，研究的立场、观点、方法却完全不管，这会引导学生走向何处呢？
    这种埋头故纸堆中，厚古薄今、脱离实际、脱离政治的倾向，是一种危险的倾向。在这种教学思想的指导下，培养出来的学生小则是书呆子，严重的是满脑子封建思想、资产阶级思想，决不会是有文化的爱劳动的社会主义的知识分子。我们忠告厚古薄今的教师们，必须彻底清扫在你们教学中这种习以为常的资产阶级的思想，在教学思想上来一个大革命，从立场、观点和思想感情上转变过来，坚决贯彻厚今薄古的方针。只有这样，才能使自己红透专深。
