Hubei Supply and Marketing Cooperative Actively Purchases and Processes
    Supports Farmers in Advancing into Deep Mountains and Wild Forests

    (Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, April 21) The Hubei Province Supply and Marketing Cooperative is vigorously purchasing and processing wild plants, actively supporting farmers in advancing into deep mountains and wild forests.

    In Hubei, more than 60% of the mountainous areas are covered with wild plants. Since last year, relevant departments have begun to utilize them in industry.

    The most abundant wild plants in the province are oilseed plants. Fifty-four varieties have already been successfully purchased and trial-produced, with an average oil yield of 25%. The oil yield of dog citrus seeds and chinaberry seeds is over 40%. Mountain flower seeds, which can be used to refine valuable aromatic oils, are produced in thirty-two counties throughout the province. According to surveys, the total reserves of wild plants in the province are about 400,000 dan (approximately 40 million kilograms), and if all of them are utilized, the country can increase its production of vegetable oil by more than 10 million jin (approximately 5 million kilograms). They have a wide range of uses. In addition to being edible, most of them can be used as lamp oil, for making soap, paints, printing ink, and cosmetic oils. Since last year, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has purchased more than 2 million jin of wild oilseeds and supplied them to oil mills for processing, reducing the supply of major oils in the local area.

    Hubei farmers are discovering more and more usable wild fibers and wild fruits in the mountains and forests. The approximately 20 million jin of wild hemp and bark that have been purchased can be used to make ropes, weave fishing nets, or make paper. The Wuhan textile department has also blended wild ramie and cotton to produce products such as pillowcases, bed sheets, and fabrics, with the same quality as those made entirely of cotton. Cadres of county supply and marketing cooperatives in the Enshi Special District generally take the lead in planting "experimental fields," concentrating and managing dispersed wild plants such as mountain flower seeds through artificial cultivation, gradually turning them into domesticated plants. Agricultural cooperatives in various counties of this special district also plan to turn more than twenty kinds of wild plants into domesticated plants first. (Tao Jin Yan)

    湖北供销社积极收购积极加工
    支持农民向深山野林进军
    本报武汉21日电　湖北省供销社大力收购和加工野生植物，积极支持农民向深山野林进军。
    湖北地区有60％以上的山区遍生野生植物。从去年起，有关部门就开始把它们利用到工业上来。
    全省最多的野生植物是油料植物。已经收购试制成功的五十四个品种，平均出油率达到25％，狗柑树籽和苦练树籽的出油率都在40％以上。能够炼制名贵芳香油的山花籽，遍产于全省三十二个县。据调查，全省野生植物蕴藏量约有四十万担，如果全部加以利用，可为国家增产植物油一千多万斤。它们的用途颇广，除有些可食用外，一般都能供作灯油、制肥皂、油漆、油墨用油和化妆油。去年以来，省供销社已收购野生油料二百多万斤，并且供给油坊加工，减少了当地主要油脂的供应量。
    湖北农民在山林间发现的可用野生纤维和野果类也愈来愈多。已收购的二千万斤左右野麻和树皮都可以制绳、织鱼网或造纸，武汉市纺织部门还把野生苎麻和棉花混纺，制成了枕巾、被单、布料等产品，质量与全棉织成的一样。恩施专区的县供销社干部普遍带头种“试验田”，把分散的山花籽等野生植物，通过人工栽培，加以集中管理，使之逐渐变成家生植物。这个专区各县农业社，也计划先把二十多种野生植物变为家生。（陶锦琰）
