    The Secret of the Maginot Line
    The Maginot Line was a military tunnel built by France after World War I to defend against Hitler's Germany. The depths of this project reached more than sixty meters into the earth, all constructed of reinforced concrete. It had seven levels of tunnels, twenty-five major projects, and countless passageways, intertwined and interconnected like a honeycomb. The manpower and material resources spent on such a vast project are unimaginable.

    At the time, France regarded this line as an "impregnable fortress" and felt secure. Unexpectedly, when World War II broke out, Hitler's army avoided a direct frontal assault, opting for a surprise attack on the flank, breaking through on the left wing and easily capturing Paris, rendering the Maginot Line useless.

    Recently, according to Western news agencies, the long-abandoned Maginot Line has suddenly been given renewed importance, with restoration work being carried out in extreme secrecy. Because the United States is frantically preparing for atomic warfare in Europe, this massive tunnel is being seen as an ideal atomic war base. If it is renovated, it can not only serve as a command post but also be used to store atomic weapons and military supplies.

    As early as 1954, the United States allocated special funds and tasked France with secretly carrying out the construction. In order to enhance the outer layer's resistance, in addition to concrete, steel armor was installed in certain sections. The interior of the tunnel has also been completely rebuilt, with the construction of atomic weapon storage depots, fuel and material storage depots, and a command headquarters. According to nearby workers, most of the project is nearing completion, and a large amount of atomic weapons and military supplies have already begun to be continuously transported in.

    All areas adjacent to the defense line have been designated as restricted zones. These areas, which contain mines and factories, are all controlled by the U.S. military. Nearby air force bases are also used by the U.S. military. Plans are also underway to build rocket launch pads, forming a complete set of atomic warfare machinery.

    The French government's actions in following the U.S. war policy, regardless of the safety of the lives and property of its own people, have aroused widespread anger among the French people. Since the secret of the Maginot Line's restoration was revealed, public opinion has been in an uproar, and residents in nearby areas are even more indignant. Workers say: "Now we have nuclear bombs above our heads, atomic bombs under our feet, and rockets surrounding us on all sides. If something happens, we will be the first to be hit. This is what we firmly oppose!" The mayor of Bas-Usy said: "I am just a civil servant, but I oppose the storage of atomic weapons here. If something happens, what will be left of us here?"

    马奇诺防线的秘密
    马奇诺防线是法国在第一次世界大战以后，为了防御希特勒德国而建造的一座军用隧道。这一工事的深处，直入地层达六十余公尺，全部为钢筋混凝土建成。计有七级隧道，主要工程二十五处，间道则不计其数，错综交织，相互沟通，如蜂房一般。这样浩大的工程，所费的人力和物力，是不可想像的。
    当时，法国把这一防线视若“金汤之固”，以为有恃无恐。不料二次大战爆发，希特勒的军队避实就虚，不从正面进攻，而采侧面奇袭，突破左翼，轻取巴黎，使这一防线等于虚设。
    最近，据西方通讯社透露，荒废已久的马奇诺防线忽然又被重视起来，在极端秘密中进行修复工程。因为美国正疯狂地在欧洲准备原子战，这一巨大隧道就被视为很理想的原子战争基地。如果将它改建，不仅可作为指挥部，而且可用来贮藏原子武器和军用物资。
    早在1954年，美国便拨出专款，责成法国秘密进行施工。为了增强外层的抵抗力，除用混凝土外，还在一定地段装置钢甲。隧道内部也已彻底改建，并建有原子武器储藏库和燃料物资储藏库及司令部。据附近工人证明，大部工程将近告竣，且已开始源源不绝地运入大量原子武器和军事物资。
    所有防线毗连地带，均划作警戒区。这些地区有矿山、有工厂，都控制在美军手中。附近的空军基地也都归美军使用。还在计划建造火箭发射台。形成整套的原子战争机器。
    法国政府追随美国战争政策，不顾本国人民的生命财产安全的行动，引起了法国人民的普遍愤怒。自从修复马奇诺防线的秘密揭穿后，众论哗然，附近地区的居民，更十分激愤。工人们说：“现在我们头上顶着核弹，脚下踏着原子弹，四面受着火箭的包围，一旦有事，我们首当其冲，这是我们坚决反对的！”巴司玉兹的市长说：“我不过是个公务员，但我反对在这里贮藏原子武器，万一有个如何，那我们这里还有什么呢？”
