Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: According to a report by the German News Agency, the Chairman of the Cameroon People's Union, Moumie, recently gave an interview to a "Neues Deutschland" reporter in Cairo, vehemently criticizing West Germany's plan, together with France, to test nuclear weapons in southern Sahara. He said that such tests would have an extremely serious impact on the people of Central Africa. Therefore, for several weeks, representatives of the people in various French colonies in the region have successively lodged strong protests in parliament or with the French government and the National Assembly regarding the aforementioned plan.

Moumie believes that the Soviet Union's decision to stop nuclear weapons tests is a "major step towards peace." He said: "The colonial peoples who are still suffering oppression are particularly concerned about the elimination of the danger of war, because this is conducive to our liberation."

Moumie then said that for the wishes and interests of all mankind, people demand that the United States and Britain follow the example of the Soviet Union.

Moumie emphasized: "The Soviet Union has already set such an outstanding example, and all mankind is opposing atomic weapons. At such a time, the Bonn imperialists have passed a decision to equip the West German army with atomic weapons. Their sins are therefore even more obvious."

    喀麦隆人民联盟主席
    抨击西德和法国核试验
    新华社11日讯　据德意志通讯社报道，喀麦隆人民联盟主席穆米埃最近对“新德意志报”驻开罗记者发表谈话，猛烈抨击西德同法国在撒哈拉南部试验核武器的计划。他说，这种试验将对中非洲人民产生极其严重的影响。因此，几个星期来，法国在这个地区的各个殖民地的人民代表，已经就上述计划先后在议会里或向法国政府和国民议会提出了强烈抗议。
    穆米埃认为，苏联停止核武器试验的决定是一项“争取和平的重大步骤”。他说：“仍然在遭受压迫的殖民地人民特别关心战争危险的消除，因为这有助于我们的解放。”
    穆米埃接着说，为了全体人类的愿望和利益，人们要求美英两国效法苏联的榜样。
    穆米埃强调说：“苏联已经作出这样卓越的榜样，而且全体人类都正在反对原子武器。在这样的时候，波恩帝国主义者却通过了用原子武器装备西德军队的决定。他们的罪孽因此也就更加明显。”
