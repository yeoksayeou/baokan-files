    Many New Things in Yunnan's Countryside, Yi Ethnic Group Troupe Busy Performing
    The Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture Troupe of Yunnan Province is going deep into the countryside to interview new people and new events in the Great Leap Forward, and compile and perform new plays.
    The troupe sent three working groups to counties such as Dayao, Yao'an, and Yongren. Although there were only twelve people, they created five small song and dance dramas and two folk songs in a short period. They often collected materials separately during the day, wrote scripts in the afternoon, rehearsed before and after meals and while walking, and in the evening, they put on makeup and went to the fields or construction sites. Wherever there were many people, they inserted a bamboo pole, hung up a kerosene lamp, and performed new plays. The content of their performances were all familiar people and events to the masses, and they also used the flower lantern drama form that the masses loved to see, so the masses liked to watch it very much.

    云南农村新事多彝族剧团演唱忙
    云南省楚雄彝族自治州剧团深入农村，采访大跃进中的新人新事，编演新剧目。
    剧团派到大姚、姚安、永仁等县的三个工作组，虽然只有十二个人，但他们在短短期间就创作了五个小型歌舞剧、两支山歌。他们常常是白天分头搜集材料，下午编写剧本，饭前饭后和走路的时间进行排练，晚上化妆起来到田间或工地去，哪里人多，就在哪里插上一根竹杆，挂起汽灯，演起新戏来。他们演唱的内容都是群众的熟人熟事，又用了群众喜闻乐见的花灯剧形式，因此群众很喜欢看。
