The Academy of Sciences Library Improves Its Work

(This report) In order to meet the needs of the broad masses of readers, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Library has been open on Sundays since March. At the same time, book-borrowing stations and reading rooms have been established in areas with a high concentration of scientific research institutions and universities, such as the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy in Zhongguancun, Xijiao. This solves the difficulty of spending two or three hours traveling to the city to borrow a book.

In order to better serve scientific research work and save readers' time, the library also allows readers from outside the Academy to borrow books with credentials; and has launched a letter and telephone book borrowing service. (Jiang Guangtian)

    科学院图书馆改进工作
    本报讯　中国科学院图书馆为了满足广大读者的要求，从3月起，星期日也开放了。同时在科学研究机构、大专院校多的地方，如西郊中关村化工冶金研究所，设立了借书站和阅览室。解决了郊外到城内来借一次书花两三个钟头的困难。
    为了更好地为科学研究工作服务，节省读者的时间，图书馆还允许院外读者凭证借阅；并开展了信函和电话借书。　（蒋光田）
