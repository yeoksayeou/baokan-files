    Open Your Hearts
    Ruo Bo
    "Dedicate your heart to the Party, dedicate your knowledge to the people"—this slogan marks the determination of intellectuals to transform themselves and to serve the people. Currently, the Two-Anti movement being carried out in various scientific, cultural, educational, and artistic departments, whether in big-character posters, symposiums, or the Great Leap Forward parades, scientists, professors, and writers have put forward slogans like "Exchange selfishness for public spirit, heart-to-heart connection," have presented letters of determination to open their hearts to the Party, have proposed Red and Expert plans and initiatives to strive to be leftists, as well as the comprehensive collaboration of Shanghai scientists and the going to the countryside and mountains of agricultural science workers. These slogans and actions all mark a new progress in the thinking of intellectuals, which is very gratifying.
    However, there are also some who still stand on individualistic positions in treating the current movement, who still do not dare to open their hearts boldly, or who only open half their hearts, or who open fake hearts. They still have the hypocritical habits brought about by the old society of "only speaking three-tenths of what you know to others, and never revealing your whole heart," and the remnants of the petty bourgeois mentality of backstabbing and mutual deception brought about by the old society. These things hinder the development of conscious revolution and the criticism and self-criticism of being both Red and Expert.
    The time has come. Don't let the great opportunity to be burned red and thoroughly in the raging fire of the Two-Anti pass by! To change the state of being indecisive, half-hearted, and insincere, we must open our hearts sincerely and completely, so that we can truly achieve "exchange selfishness for public spirit, heart-to-heart connection," and truly achieve one heart and one mind, wholeheartedly serving the people and socialist construction. Qu Zhongxiang, a scientist from Kunming, put forward a proposal against "private ownership of knowledge, individual work, technical conservatism, and unwillingness to open one's heart," and advocated "public knowledge, collective cooperation, technical innovation, and thorough dedication of one's heart," which is worthy of everyone's deep reflection and serious consideration.

    交真心
    若波
    “把心交给党，把知识交给人民”，这个口号标志了知识分子愿意改造自己，愿意为人民服务的决心。目前各地科学、文教、文艺等部门开展的双反运动，无论在大字报和座谈会上，或是在大跃进游行中，科学家、教授、作家们提出了“交私心，换公心，心心相印”的口号，提出了向党交心的决心书，提出了红专规划和争取做左派的倡议，以及上海科学家的全面协作，农业科学工作者的下乡上山。这些口号和行动，都标志了知识分子的思想有了新的进步，是很可喜的事情。
    但是，也还有一些仍旧站在个人主义立场对待当前运动的人，还是不敢大胆地交心，或是交出半心，或是交了假心。他们还有着旧社会带来的“逢人只说三分话，未可全抛一片心”的虚伪习惯，还有着旧社会带来的钩心斗角，尔虞我诈的市侩残余。这些东西障碍着自觉革命，又红又专的批评和自我批评的发展。
    是时候了。在双反的烈火中烧红烧透的大好时机，不要再放过去吧！要改变三心二意，半心半意，假心假意的状态，就要交真心，彻底交心，这样才能真正做到“交私心，换公心，心心相印”，真正做到一心一德，全心全意为人民、为社会主义建设服务。昆明科学家曲仲湘提出了反对“知识私有，个人单干，技术保守，不肯交心”，提倡“知识公开，集体合作，革新技术，彻底交心”的倡议，值得大家深思猛省。
