Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th Dispatch: The Soviet government suggested in a memorandum to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the 11th that an exchange of views on preparing for a meeting of foreign ministers begin in Moscow on April 17th. The memorandum suggested that the meeting of foreign ministers be held no later than the end of April to mid-May this year, and that all preparatory work for the meeting of foreign ministers through diplomatic channels should be completed before then.

The Soviet government believes that the exchange of views through diplomatic channels should be limited to those limited issues directly related to the arrangement of the meeting with foreign ministers—the time, place, and members of the meeting of foreign ministers. As for the meeting of foreign ministers, the Soviet government believes that the foreign ministers should negotiate the time, place, and members of the high-level meeting, determine the scope of issues to be discussed at the high-level meeting, and at the same time, it does not rule out exchanging views on certain issues proposed by all parties to be included in the agenda of the high-level meeting when necessary (as long as everyone agrees), in order to clarify which issues are appropriate to be included in the agenda of this meeting.

However, the memorandum emphasized that the issue of convening a high-level meeting cannot be entangled with this or that outcome of the meeting of foreign ministers. Even if the foreign ministers fail to reach the necessary agreement on preparing for the high-level meeting, it does not in the slightest mean that the necessity of the high-level meeting is any less urgent. The memorandum said that it is incorrect to make the issue of convening a high-level meeting dependent on the outcome of the meeting of foreign ministers. The difficulties that may arise during the meeting of foreign ministers can and should be overcome at the meeting of national leaders, because they have broader authority.

The Soviet government's memorandum is a response to the notes of the U.S., British, and French governments on March 31 this year regarding the Soviet Union's note on accelerating the preparation for a high-level meeting. In their notes, the above-mentioned three governments expressed the need to convene a high-level meeting under the current international situation, but in essence, they evaded answering the specific suggestions made by the Soviet Union as early as December last year regarding convening a high-level meeting.

This memorandum has been handed over to the diplomatic envoys of the United States, Britain, and France stationed in the Soviet Union in Moscow by the Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko.

    苏联向美英法提出备忘录
    建议十七日开始商谈安排外长会议
    同时指出高级会议不能取决于外长会晤的结果
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府在11日给美国、英国、法国政府的备忘录中建议4月17日开始在莫斯科就筹备外长会晤交换意见。备忘录建议，外长会晤不迟于今年4月底到5月中旬举行，而通过外交途径为外长会晤进行的全部筹备工作都应当在这以前完成。
    苏联政府认为，通过外交途径进行的交换意见只限于那些与安排同外长会晤直接有关的有限问题——外长会晤的时间、地点和成员问题。至于外长会晤，苏联政府认为，外长们应当协商高级会议的时间、地点和成员，确定将在高级会议上讨论的问题的范围，同时也不排斥在必要的时候（只要大家都同意，就各方建议列入高级会议议程的某些问题交换意见，以便弄清楚把哪些问题列入这个会议的议程是适宜的。
    但是，备忘录着重指出，召开高级会议的问题不能够同外长会晤的这种或那种结果纠缠在一起。纵使外长们不能就筹备高级会议的问题达成必要的协议，也丝毫不意味着高级会议的必要性就不那么迫切。备忘录说，把召开高级会议的问题取决于外长会晤的结果是不正确的，外长会晤期间可能产生的困难可以而且应当在国家领导人的会议上得到克服，因为他们拥有更加广泛的权限。
    苏联政府的这项备忘录是对美、英、法三国政府今年3月31日就苏联关于加速筹备高级会议的照会的答复。上述三国政府在它们的照会中作出了在目前国际局势下需要召开高级会议的表示，但是，实质上它们回避回答苏联早在去年12月提出的关于召开高级会议的具体建议。
    这项备忘录已经在莫斯科由苏联外交部长葛罗米柯交给美、英、法三国驻苏联的外交使节。
