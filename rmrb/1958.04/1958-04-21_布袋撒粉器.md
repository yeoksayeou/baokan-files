    Burlap Bag Duster
    Using a seven-foot-long bamboo pole, tie six small burlap bags to it, each containing twelve ounces of pesticide. Nail six T-shaped small bamboo sticks to the bamboo pole and insert them into the burlap bags. When dusting, the bags will only vibrate up and down, not sway from side to side. When applying pesticide, place the bags in the wheat rows and move forward gradually, shaking the powder. Dusting is convenient, and the powder is evenly distributed. Each burlap bag duster can dust over ten mu of land per day. When filled with 666 pesticide, it can be used to prevent and control various pests such as wheat thrips, spider mites, wheat aphids, and wheat sawflies.

    布袋撒粉器
    用一根七尺长的竹杆，拴上六个小布袋，每个小布袋内装药十二两。竹杆上钉六个丁字形小竹棍，插进小布袋里，撒粉时布袋只会上下震动，不会左右摆动。喷药时将布袋放置麦垅中，逐步前进，震动药粉，撒药方便，出粉均匀。每个布袋撒粉器一天可以撒药十余亩。装上六六六药粉可用来防治小麦吸浆虫、麦园蜘蛛、麦蚜、麦叶蜂等多种害虫。
