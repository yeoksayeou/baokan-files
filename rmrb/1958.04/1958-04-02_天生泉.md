A Song of the Great Leap Forward

    Heavenly Spring
    Li Ji
    The North Mountain of Gaolan County,
    Has a Heavenly Spring.
    The village is called Zhuangziping,
    Dry, arid, bitter, and poor.
    The mountain is so dry that a goatskin won't stick to it,
    The land is so barren that nine out of ten crops fail.
    Every family worries about the next meal after finishing one,
    Everyone's upper body is clothed but their lower body is bare.
    With such land,
    With such mountains,
    They can still conquer drought,
    And change nature.
    In the past, the mountain was like a monk's bald head,
    No water flowed in the ditches,
    Now clear water flows everywhere,
    And every year brings a bumper harvest.
    If anyone doesn't believe that human effort can conquer nature,
    Then let them come and see the Zhuangziping Agricultural Cooperative.
    Every dry plot has become irrigated land,
    The cooperative members sing heroic vows:
    "If our cooperative is to be disbanded,
    It will only be by burying an atomic bomb!"
    Asking the reason, it's actually simple,
    Digging the Heavenly Spring is the first thing to consider.
    The Heavenly Spring is not naturally formed,
    It was dug by people's own hands.
    Nature's heart is biased,
    Zhuangziping has little rain and lacks rivers.
    Drought is not predetermined,
    It can't defeat the heroes of the heroic cooperative.
    No water in the sky or on the ground,
    Dig a spring underground.
    Underground water is as abundant as a river,
    But digging one well won't quench the thirst.
    The underground water flow is wide and vast,
    Build several culverts to block it.
    Several culverts, several miles long,
    Like several arms stretching underground to block the water.
    Blocking the water flow to follow the culverts,
    Several culverts combine into one outlet.
    Abundant water source, high water pressure,
    Drought-stricken Zhuangziping has a river!
    The longer the culverts, the bigger the river,
    The dry land has all become irrigated land!
    Digging culverts more than thirty feet underground,
    Dark, wet, and cold.
    Young people all want to be "water tigers,"
    Rushing down the cave, unstoppable.
    With bedding and rations on their backs,
    They set up a battlefield underground.
    Not seeing the Yellow River, they won't give up,
    Not digging open the water source, they won't leave the front line.
    A layer of mud, a layer of sand,
    Hard slate breaks the hoe handle.
    Twenty-four or five-year-old lads in their prime,
    One swing of the hoe bends the tip.
    Putting down the hoe, use a steel drill,
    Swing the twelve-pound hammer.
    The tiger's wrist trembles, drawing fresh blood,
    Only then is a white dent made on the slate.
    It's the twelfth lunar month,
    Gale and snow cover the mountains and rivers.
    The heroes have fought hard for three months,
    The cave is filled with songs and sweat.
    In the past, tunnels were dug for resistance,
    Now culverts are dug for production.
    Don't look at our barren land,
    In a few years, we will cross the Yellow River and chase after the South.
    Coming out of the culvert, they see the Party Secretary,
    And frankly offer their opinion:
    The spring was opened by the hands of heroes,
    Why call it "Heavenly Spring"?
    The Party Secretary asked me what it should be called,
    I said it should be called "Great Leap Forward Spring"!

    天生泉
    李季
    皋兰县的北山，
    有个天生泉。
    村子名叫庄子坪，
    又干又旱又苦穷。
    山是拉羊皮不粘草的干山，
    地是十种九不收的庄田。
    家家吃了上顿愁下顿，
    人人穿了上身缺下身。
    凭着这样的地，
    凭着这样的山，
    他们也能够战胜干旱，
    改变自然。
    过去山是和尚头，
    沟里无水流，
    现在清水遍地淌，
    年年都丰收。
    谁要是不相信人的干劲能胜天，
    就请他到庄子坪农业社来看看。
    块块旱地变成水浇地，
    社员们高唱着英雄的壮言豪语：
    “若要我们的合作社解散，
    除非埋上个原子弹！”
    问起原因，倒也简单，
    挖开天生泉，要算第一件。
    天生泉不是天生成，
    它是靠人们的双手挖掘成。
    大自然它把心长偏，
    庄子坪雨少又缺河川。
    干旱不是命定的，
    难不倒英雄社的英雄汉。
    天上地上没有水，
    地层底下挖水泉。
    地下水源旺如河，
    打一口水井不解渴。
    地下水流宽又广，
    打几条涵洞来拦挡。
    几条涵洞几里长，
    活像伸到地底下的几只胳膊把水挡。
    挡定水流顺着涵洞走，
    几条涵洞合成一个出水口。
    水源旺，水头高，
    干旱的庄子坪有河了。
    涵洞越长河越大，
    旱地都变成水地啦！
    三丈多深的地底下打涵洞，
    又黑又湿又阴冷。
    年轻人都要当“水老虎”，
    争先下洞谁也止不住。
    背上铺盖带上粮，
    地层底下摆战场。
    不见黄河心不甘，
    不挖开水源不下火线。
    一层泥巴一层沙，
    硬石板碰断镢头把。
    二十四五的小伙子正当年，
    一镢头下去把尖碰弯。
    撂下镢头用钢钻，
    十二磅重的大锤抡开干。
    虎腕震得冒鲜血，
    石板上才打了一个白眼眼。
    正是十冬腊月天，
    狂风飞雪扑山川。
    好汉们苦战已三月，
    满洞里歌声混身汗。
    过去挖地道为抗战，
    现在打涵洞为生产。
    不要看我们这干旱不毛地，
    几年后也要跨过黄河撵江南。
    出了涵洞见支书，
    开门见山提意见：
    泉是英雄好汉双手开，
    为什么叫它“天生泉”？
    支书问我该叫啥名字，
    我说该叫它“跃进泉”！
