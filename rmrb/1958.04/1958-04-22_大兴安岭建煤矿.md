Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, 21st: The first coal mine in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area – the May 9th Coal Mine – has begun production while still under construction.

This coal mine will begin mass production in 1959, and by 1961, it will be able to produce 600,000 tons of coal. Once it is fully built and put into production, it will play a significant role in saving timber resources in the forest area. Currently, the fuel used for heating and cooking by the workers in the forest area is mostly timber, burning hundreds of thousands of cubic meters a year.

    大兴安岭建煤矿
    新华社海拉尔21日电　大兴安岭林区第一个煤矿——五九煤矿开始边建设边生产。
    这座煤矿将在1959年开始大量生产，到1961年可采煤六十万吨。它全部建成投入生产以后，对于林区节省木材资源将起很大作用。现在林区职工取暖、作饭所用的燃料绝大部分是木材，一年要烧掉几十万立方公尺。
