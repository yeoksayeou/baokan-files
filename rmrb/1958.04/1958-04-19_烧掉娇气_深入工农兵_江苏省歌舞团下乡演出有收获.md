Burn Away Daintiness, Go Deep Among Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
Jiangsu Provincial Song and Dance Troupe Gains from Rural Performances

(Reported by this newspaper) The Jiangsu Provincial Song and Dance Troupe was originally a very pampered troupe. For example, some dancers needed to eat five meals a day, and some singers dared not wear woolen scarves, fearing that wool fibers would fly into their throats and ruin their voices. Many performers had to take pedicabs even for short distances in the city, and instead of going to the countryside to learn folk dances, they would invite farmers to the city, and so on. In addition, the extravagance of this song and dance troupe was also very serious.

However, since art troupes from all over the country have gone to the countryside and mountains, this song and dance troupe was unwilling to lag behind. From the end of February, they performed in the rural areas of Jiangning, Jurong, and Lishui counties for more than a month. This month-long performance was truly a socialist revolutionary baptism for the song and dance troupe. Before departure, the leaders announced the matters that should be paid attention to. Everyone carried backpacks and musical instruments on foot. At first, they could only walk five or ten li, but gradually they didn't care about thirty li. Sometimes they performed in one place during the day and had to rush to another place at night. If they arrived at the performance location early, they immediately participated in labor. Now everyone can carry a load of thirty or fifty jin. In Huangmei Township, Jurong, they delivered fertilizer to nine mu of fields in one morning. Although the marching, performing, and labor were very intense, they still compiled three dances and more than ten songs with realistic themes in one month. When they arrived at Huangmei Township in Jurong County, they also composed a song called "We Won't Be Satisfied Until We Take Back the Red Flag" in response to the backward production situation in the township, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for production. In this month, the troupe performed a total of forty-one shows, with an audience of approximately 242,000 person-times, earning more than 5,000 yuan, averaging about 150 yuan per day.

Going to the countryside for performances has not only strengthened the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, but also laid a foundation of confidence for running the troupe diligently and thriftily, opposing waste, and striving for economic self-sufficiency this year. In the past, most comrades in the troupe had little confidence in implementing enterprise management, and it was originally planned that the state would still subsidize 95,000 yuan this year. However, after this rural performance and a careful calculation, they overcame their conservative thinking. At the provincial state-owned theater troupe work conference in mid-March, the head of the troupe proposed that this year, not only should they achieve economic self-sufficiency, but they should also strive for a surplus.

### 烧掉娇气　深入工农兵  江苏省歌舞团下乡演出有收获

    烧掉娇气　深入工农兵
    江苏省歌舞团下乡演出有收获
    本报讯　江苏省歌舞团原来是一个娇气十足的歌舞团，如有些舞蹈演员一天要吃五顿饭，有些歌唱演员不敢围毛织品围巾，怕毛纤维飞进喉咙坏了嗓子。不少演员在城市内行动都得坐三轮车，学习民间舞蹈不下乡，把农民请到城里来，等等。此外，这个歌舞团的阔气也很严重。
    但是，自从全国各地艺术团体纷纷下乡上山以后，这个歌舞团也不甘落后。他们从2月底起就到江宁、句容、溧水等三个县的农村演出了一个多月。这一个多月的演出，对于歌舞团来说，真是一次社会主义的革命洗礼。出发前，领导上宣布了应该注意的事项，大家都背上背包带上乐器步行，起初只能走十里八里，逐渐地三十里都不在乎了。有时白天在一个地方演出，晚上要赶到另一个地方。到达演出地点早，就马上参加劳动，现在每人都能挑上三、五十斤重的担子，他们在句容黄梅乡一个上午就送了九亩田的肥料。虽然行军、演出、劳动非常紧张，但在一个月内仍然以现实题材编了三个舞和十多支歌。他们到句容县黄梅乡时，还针对该乡生产落后的情况，编了一首“不夺回红旗心不甘”的歌，对群众生产干劲鼓舞很大。在这一个多月的时间里该团一共演出了四十一场，观众约二十四万二千余人次，收入五千余元，平均每天一百五十元左右。
    下乡演出不仅坚定了为工农兵服务的方向，而且对于勤俭办团、反浪费、争取今年经济上自给自足也奠定了信心。过去该团一般同志对实行企业化都信心不大，原计划今年仍要国家补助九万五千元。但是经过这次下乡演出，再算算细账，就克服了保守思想。在3月中旬的全省国营剧团工作会议上，该团团长提出今年不但在经济上要做到自给自足，而且要争取有盈余。
