    How Can Manual Mountain Engineering Leap Forward?
    A Guizhou Exploration Team Implements Two Major Reforms
    (Our Reporter Guo Longchun reports) For industries using manual labor, what are the most realistic and effective measures to promote a production leap forward? The experience of the He (Zhang) Wei (Ning) Shui (Cheng) Exploration Team of the Guizhou Provincial Geological Bureau is: reform tools, improve operating methods. With the assistance of technicians from the Guizhou Provincial Geological Bureau, this team improved blasting methods and drill bits in mountain engineering. With these two technical reforms, without waiting for the use of machines, work efficiency has increased by about one time.
    In the past, this team, like many geological exploration teams across the country, used to dig tunnels by drilling a small-diameter blast hole and then blasting, which had little power to break rocks and ores. Last year, the workers and technicians of this team creatively and systematically applied the expansion blasting method, which was previously mainly used in open-pit mines and open-pit quarries, to underground tunnels. Expanding the bottom of small blast holes increased the space at the bottom of the hole, greatly increasing the amount of explosives loaded. As a result, blasting efficiency increased from 70% to 75% to 95% to 110%, the number of blast holes decreased by one-third to one-half, and explosive consumption decreased by 15% to 30%. Since 83% of the mountain engineering of various exploration teams under the Ministry of Geology is still done manually, this improvement in manual drilling and blasting measures has great value. Relevant officials of the Ministry of Geology believe that expansion blasting is a revolution in manual excavation and blasting technology.
    In the past, the He Wei Shui Geological Exploration Team used old-fashioned chisel bits for drilling. Last year, it promoted three-edged chisel bits and stepped chisel bits, which improved work efficiency to some extent, but it still could not adapt to the situation of this year's Great Leap Forward. In February this year, they created a U-shaped chisel bit, which increased drilling efficiency by 40% to 50%.
    Glossary: Mountain Engineering
    There are two main means of exploration in the geological sector: drilling and mountain engineering.
    Drilling can be used to explore larger areas of deeply buried ore deposits with less investment. Before large-scale drilling operations are carried out, a large number of trench explorations and shallow well excavations are also needed to understand the situation of the ore body. The engineering of excavating tunnels, shallow wells, and exploratory trenches, and taking mineral samples is collectively referred to as mountain engineering.

    手工操作的山地工程怎样跃进？
    贵州一个勘探队实行了两大改革
    本报讯　记者郭龙春报道：对工业部门中用手工操作的工种来说，目前促进生产跃进的最现实最有力的措施是什么？贵州省地质局赫（章）威（宁）水（城）勘探队提供的经验是：改革工具，改进操作方法。这个队在贵州省地质局技术人员的协助下，在山地工程中改进了爆破方法，改进了打眼的钎头，有了这两项技术上的改革，不必等待改用机器，工作效率就提高约一倍。
    这个队过去开挖坑道，和全国许多地质勘探队一样，都是打一个直径很小的炮眼就进行爆破，破碎岩石、矿石的威力不大。去年，这个队的工人和技术人员创造性地把以往主要用于露天矿和露天采石场的扩底爆破法，系统地运用于地下坑道。在小炮眼中进行扩底，使炮眼底部的空间增大，装炸药的数量大大增加。结果爆破效率由70％至75％提高到95％到110％，炮眼数目减少三分之一到二分之一，炸药消耗量减少15％至30％。由于目前地质部所属各勘探队的山地工程83％都还是手工操作，这一改进手工打眼放炮的措施，有很大价值。地质部的有关负责人认为：扩底爆破是手掘爆破技术上的一次革命。
    赫威水地质勘探队过去打眼使用老式的一字钎，去年曾推广三刃钎头、阶梯钎头，工作效率有所提高，但还不能适应今年大跃进的形势。今年2月间，他们创造了U形钎头，使打眼效率提高了40％到50％。
    名词解释：山地工程
    地质部门勘探的手段主要有两种：一是钻探，一是山地工程。
    钻探可以用较少的投资，勘探面积较大、埋藏较深的矿床。在钻探工作大规模铺开以前，也需要大量进行槽探和开挖浅井，来初步了解矿体的情况。这种开挖坑道、浅井、探槽，采取矿产样品的工程，统称为山地工程。
