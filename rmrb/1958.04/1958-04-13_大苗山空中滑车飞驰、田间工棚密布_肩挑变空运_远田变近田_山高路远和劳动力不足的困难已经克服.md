    Aerial Cable Cars Fly in the Great Miao Mountains, Field Sheds Dot the Landscape
    Shoulder Carrying Becomes Air Transport, Distant Fields Become Near Fields
    Difficulties of High Mountains, Long Roads, and Labor Shortages Have Been Overcome
    (Report from our Nanning Correspondent, Gong Jingzhi, April 11) In the Great Miao Mountains Miao Autonomous County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, two methods have been adopted: aerial cable car transportation and building sheds in the fields for mountain cultivation. Shoulder carrying has been transformed into air transport, and distant fields have become near fields, overcoming the difficulties of high mountains, long roads, and labor shortages. This will save more than 1.48 million workdays annually, creating extremely favorable conditions for achieving a great leap forward in agriculture this year.
    The Miao, Dong, Zhuang, Han, Yao, and other ethnic groups residing in the Great Miao Mountains, a high and cold mountainous area with an altitude of 400 to 1,000 meters, have formulated a great leap forward plan this year to change the backward face of the mountainous area. The target for increasing grain production is to increase the yield per mu from 362 jin last year to 1,000 jin per mu, and the total output is to increase by 119% compared with last year. In order to achieve this plan, the county has adopted a series of production increase measures, such as expanding the planting area of double-cropping rice, increasing fertilizer application, advancing spring plowing, three plowings and three harrows, deep plowing and close planting, etc. However, it is very difficult to achieve this plan in the Great Miao Mountains. Here, the mountains are high and the roads are long, the fields are scattered, and 60% of the fields are distant fields. The farmers of all ethnic groups can only work in the fields for five hours a day, and the rest of the time is spent walking back and forth and climbing mountains. Therefore, the contradiction between production increase measures and labor shortage is very prominent. They calculated the problem of transporting fertilizer to the fields. If the county's accumulated 390 million dan of fertilizer are still transported by shoulder carrying this year, even if all the labor force in the county is mobilized, it will take 60 days to transport it all. If this difficulty is not overcome, this year's leap forward plan will inevitably fail.
    Farmers of all ethnic groups have tried every means to overcome the difficulties of the natural environment. The cadres and masses who were sent to the countryside in Gudu Xiangfen Township, Sirong District, first studied a method to overcome the difficulty of transporting fertilizer. Based on the experience of aerial soil transportation during water conservancy construction, they used slopes to erect iron wires (or ropes) in the air and hang cable cars to transport fertilizer. Pingmao Agricultural Cooperative, Gongdong District, based on the experience of going up the mountains, living in the mountains to make forests and accumulate fertilizer last winter and this spring, built tents in the fields to live in the mountains and cultivate, accelerating the speed of spring plowing and sowing. The Great Miao Mountains Miao Autonomous County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly summarized these two experiences of overcoming natural difficulties. The method of implementing aerial transportation in mountainous areas is simple and easy to implement. It can not only transport fertilizer, but all firewood and grass released from the mountains can be transported by ropes in the air. Building sheds in the fields and rushing to cultivate during the busy production season, turning distant fields into near fields, and improving labor efficiency are effective measures to solve the problems of high mountains, long roads, and labor shortages.
    These two methods have been widely welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups in the county. After 16 hours of assault on March 24, a total of 20,394 work sheds were built in the county, with an average of one shed for every four mu of land. In this way, at least one-third of the labor force can be saved from 60% of the distant fields, and more than one million workdays can be saved throughout the year. Up to now, the county has erected 345 aerial cable car transportation lines, with a total length of more than 15,000 zhang, and 264 are being erected, with a length of 226,700 zhang. The effect of aerial cable car fertilizer transportation is very good, and the efficiency is generally 17 times higher than shoulder carrying. The masses have also developed aerial cable car fertilizer transportation into aerial cable line transportation of timber. According to preliminary test results, the efficiency is 62% to one times higher than human pulling. The Great Miao Mountains are rich in timber. Every year, more than 100,000 cubic meters of timber are pulled down from the mountains. Pulling one cubic meter of timber requires an average of eight workdays, and 100,000 cubic meters requires 800,000 workdays. Using aerial cable line to transport timber, according to conservative calculations, more than 480,000 workdays can be saved every year and invested in other production activities.
    Now, the county has overcome the difficulty of labor shortage in the current spring plowing production and has sufficient conditions for intensive cultivation, so that spring crops can be planted in season.

### 大苗山空中滑车飞驰、田间工棚密布  肩挑变空运　远田变近田  山高路远和劳动力不足的困难已经克服

    大苗山空中滑车飞驰、田间工棚密布
    肩挑变空运　远田变近田
    山高路远和劳动力不足的困难已经克服
    本报南宁11日电　记者宫敬之报道：广西僮族自治区大苗山苗族自治县，采取了空中滑车运输和田间搭棚住山耕耘两项办法，变肩挑为空运，变远田为近田，克服了山高路远劳动力不足的困难，全年可节省出一百四十八万多个人工，为实现今年农业大跃进创造了极为有利的条件。
    住居在海拔四百到一千公尺的高寒山区的大苗山苗、侗、僮、汉、瑶等族人民，今年订出了改变山区落后面貌的大跃进规划。粮食增产指标要由去年亩产三百六十二斤提高到亩产一千斤，总产量要比去年增产119％。为了实现这个规划，这个县采取了一系列的增产措施。如扩大双季稻种植面积、增施肥料、提早春耕、三犁三耙、深耕密植等。但是，在大苗山要实现这个规划是很不容易的。这里山高路远，田地分散，60％的田是远田。各族农民每天只能在田里工作五个小时，其余的时间都花在往返走路爬山上面。因此，增产措施和劳动力不足的矛盾十分突出。他们就送肥上地的问题算了一个账，如果全县所积三亿九千多万担肥料今年仍用肩挑的办法，全县的劳动力总动员，也得六十天才能运完。这一难关不突破，今年的跃进规划势必落空。
    各族农民想尽办法战胜自然环境的困难。四荣区古都香粉乡的下放干部和群众，首先研究出了克服运肥困难的办法。他们根据修水利时空中运土的经验，利用斜坡在空中架铁线（或绳索）挂滑车运肥。拱洞区平卯农业社根据去冬今春上山、住山造林、积肥的经验，在田头上搭起帐篷住山耕耘，加快了春耕播种速度。中共大苗山苗族自治县委及时总结了这两项战胜自然困难的经验，在山区实行空中运输的办法简单易行，不但能运肥，所有从山上下放的柴草，都可利用绳索空运；在田间搭工棚，在生产繁忙季节住山突击耕种，变远田为近田，提高劳动效率，是解决山高路远、劳动力不足的有效措施。
    这两个办法得到了全县各族人民的普遍欢迎。在3月24日经过十六个小时的突击，全县就搭起了工棚二万零三百九十四个，平均每四亩田就有一个工棚。这样，60％的远田至少可以节省出三分之一的劳动力，全年就可节省出一百多万个人工。到目前为止，全县已架设好空中滑车运输线三百四十五条，共长一万五千多丈，正在架设的有二百六十四条，长二十二万六千七百丈。空中滑车运肥效果很好，一般比肩挑效率提高十七倍。群众还把空中滑车运肥发展为空中拉线运木材，根据初步试验的结果，比人拉效率提高62％到一倍。大苗山盛产木材，每年要从山上拉下十万多立方公尺的木材，拉一立方公尺的木材远近平均要八个人工，十万立方公尺就要八十万个人工。用空中拉线放运木材，据保守的计算，每年也可节省出四十八万多个人工投入其他生产活动。
    现在，这个县克服了当前春耕生产中劳动力不足的困难，有了充分的条件进行精耕细作，使春种作物都能抢上季节。
