    Comrade Gong Xing-san of the Datong City Chengxing Egg Factory: We think that your suggestion that workers contribute their bonuses to set up a factory is a good idea in spirit, but it would be inappropriate for the government to make such a decision or for any department to issue such a call. This is because bonuses are the proceeds of workers' labor and can only be disposed of by the workers themselves. As for your willingness to contribute your bonus to set up a factory, you can buy more government bonds, or deposit it in the bank, or contact the local government to resolve the issue. The Editor

    奖金只能由自己支配
    大同市诚兴蛋厂宫星三同志：你建议工人把奖金献出来办工厂，我们觉得这种精神很好，但由政府作出这样的决定或由哪个部门发出这样的号召都是不妥当的。因为奖金是工人的劳动所得，只能由工人自己去支配。至于你愿意把奖金献出来办工厂，可以去多买些公债，或者存到银行里去，或者同当地政府联系解决。　编者
