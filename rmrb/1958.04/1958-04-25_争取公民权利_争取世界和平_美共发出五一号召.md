Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd (TASS) - The National Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the United States of America has issued a "May Day Appeal to the American People."

The appeal stated that American workers are greeting May Day under the conditions of struggling against the growing disaster of unemployment, against suppression bills, against political persecution and racist terror, and for civil and democratic rights.

The appeal stated: American workers, together with all our people and the people of other countries, have new hopes for world peace, and they demand a halt to nuclear testing and demand peace. It also pointed out that due to the Soviet Union's decision to cease nuclear weapons testing, the voice of the world's working people demanding peace is now even stronger. The appeal pointed out that American Communists are fighting for employment, for civil rights, for disarmament and peace, and for a summit meeting.
