    The First Thing After Opening the Door
    Xiao Lin

    In the Great Leap Forward, all old rules and old habits must be changed. Nowadays, who can stand to look at things remaining the same! Everything, big and small, is leaping forward, and in the blink of an eye, the whole scene is brand new.

    Such scenes of leaping forward are everywhere. In the family, it is no exception. The seven necessities of life: firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea. Let's talk about the first one, firewood.

    Which family doesn't light a fire to cook, and whose kitchen doesn't have a stove? However, ordinary people probably don't bother to study such trivial household matters. They don't care whether it's a stove or a range, coal or firewood, as long as it can turn raw rice into cooked rice and fill their bellies. However, workers and farmers are using the spirit of technical innovation to improve production tools, and housewives are also innovating the "tools" they use for cooking. With this innovation, knowledge comes into play. Residents of Beijing are encouraged to burn honeycomb briquettes, using honeycomb briquette stoves. The benefits are: saving coal, saving firewood, saving trouble, less ash, cleanliness and hygiene, and ease of use. If 600,000 households in Beijing all switch to burning honeycomb briquettes, they can save more than 400,000 tons of coal and more than 170 million catties of firewood each year compared to burning coal balls. Also, because this stove produces less coal slag, the amount of garbage is also reduced, which can also save 450,000 tons of transportation capacity. Furthermore, there are also…. It turns out that the reform of burning honeycomb briquette stoves can save so much wealth for the country! There are truly endless benefits to tell. I simply don't know how to eagerly welcome this guest who has "leapt forward" into the home.

    In Beijing, burning coal ball stoves is an old habit for residents. In the courtyard where I used to live, every household had a coal ball stove, a pile of coal balls, and firewood in front of their door. In the early morning, several stoves in the courtyard would simultaneously emit smoke and fog, filling the air with dust and smoke, choking people to cough and tear up, making it impossible to breathe a bit of fresh air. Now, they have all switched to honeycomb briquette stoves, and the courtyard is suddenly much cleaner. Lighting a fire once keeps it burning for a long time, and you don't have to constantly shake the ashes, add coal, or poke the fire, which is indeed labor-saving, clean, and efficient. Whenever you want to cook something, you can open the stove door and use the fire at any time. This can be said to have greatly opened the door of convenience for people's daily housework operations of boiling water and cooking.

    I am advocating for honeycomb briquette stoves here. However, it is said that there are still some people who are unwilling to use them. The reason is that they are not used to it. They say that honeycomb briquette stoves have low firepower, are not easy to burn, and are afraid of delaying cooking, and so on. In fact, it is really unfair to say that it has low firepower. Tests conducted in Beijing have proven that the burning time and thermal efficiency of honeycomb briquettes are twice as high as those of coal balls, and there is no problem using them to cook rice, dishes, and boil water. It may be difficult to grasp its rules at the beginning of burning, which is true. Because there is a higher level of technology than burning coal ball stoves, but this can be learned quickly. I think the problem still lies in the word "habit." New things are often not accepted by people all at once, because they are used to the old and familiar with the old; they do not have enough understanding of new things and feel unaccustomed. It is easy to say, but the key to going from unaccustomed to accustomed lies in practice. Start using it, feel unaccustomed, use it a few more times, and you will feel comfortable and skilled.

    It is not easy to establish a new socialist family. This requires discarding many old ideas and changing many old habits. Where does the family leap forward from? Let's start with the first thing after opening the door!

    开门第一件事
    晓林
    在大跃进中，一切老规矩、旧习惯都要改。如今，对原封不动的老样子，谁能看得顺眼！大小事情都在跃动着，一转眼，面貌全新了。
    这种跃进的情景，触目皆是。在家庭里，也不例外。开门七件事：柴、米、油、盐、酱、醋、茶，就说这第一件，柴。
    哪一个家庭不起火做饭，谁家的厨房里没有个炉灶呢？不过，对如此家务琐事，恐怕一般人都不屑去研究的。管它是炉是灶，是煤是柴，只要能把生米做成熟饭，吃到肚子里了事。可是，工人、农民都在用技术革新的精神改进生产工具，家庭主妇们对做饭用的“工具”也在革新。这一革新，学问就来了。北京市的居民在提倡烧蜂窝煤，用蜂窝煤炉。好处是：省煤、省柴、省事，出灰少、清洁卫生、使用方便。如果北京市六十万户居民都改烧蜂窝煤，比起烧煤球来，每年可以省煤四十多万吨，省劈柴一亿七千多万斤。又因为这炉子出煤渣少，垃圾也减少，还可以节省四十五万吨的运输力。此外，还有……。原来，一项烧蜂窝煤炉的改革，能为国家节约这么多财富！真是说不尽的好。我简直不知道，该怎样殷勤地迎接这位“跃进”到家庭中来的客人。
    在北京，烧煤球炉是居民的老习惯。以前我住的院子里，家家门前都摆一个煤球炉、一堆煤球和劈柴。清晨，院子里几只炉子同时喷烟吐雾，尘烟滚滚，呛得人咳嗽流泪，休想呼吸到一点儿新鲜空气。现在，全都改用了蜂窝煤炉，院子里顿时清爽多了。生一次火，很久不灭，平时也不用经常抖灰、添煤、拔火，确是省事省力，干净俐落。什么时候想煮点什么吃，拉开炉门，随时可以用火。这对人们日常生活中用在烧水、做饭上的家务操作，可说是大开了方便之门。
    我在这里替蜂窝煤炉行道。可是，据说仍然有些人不愿意用它。原因是，不习惯。她们说蜂窝煤炉火力小、不容易烧、怕耽误做饭，等等。其实，说它火力小，实在冤枉。北京市作的试验证明，蜂窝煤的燃烧时间和热效能，要比煤球高出一倍，用它煮饭、做菜、烧开水，全不成问题。开始烧，也许不容易掌握它的规律，这倒是事实。因为这里面有比烧煤球炉高超一等的技术，但这是很快就能够学会的。我想，问题还在这“习惯”二字上。新的事物常常不能被人们一下接受，就因为习惯了旧的，熟悉了旧的；对新的事物认识不足，感到不习惯。说也容易，从不习惯到习惯，关键在实践。开始用它，感到不习惯，多用几次，就会感到随心应手了。
    要建立一个社会主义的新家庭，不是件容易事。这要丢掉许多旧思想，改变许多旧习惯。家庭从何跃进？就从这开门第一件事做起吧！
