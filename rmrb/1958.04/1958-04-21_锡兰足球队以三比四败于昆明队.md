    Ceylon Football Team Loses to Kunming Team Three to Four
    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 19th – The Ceylon National Football Team’s first football match in our country was held in Kunming City on the afternoon of the 19th. The Kunming United Football Team took the lead with four to three.
    After the match began, the visiting team adopted a long-pass attacking strategy. The home team's players closely marked the visiting team’s center forward, Mohammed Deen, who was adept at long-range shots with both feet, preventing him from displaying his unique skills. For more than half an hour, neither side scored a goal. With seven minutes left in the first half, the home team's left inside forward, Huang Mingquan, dribbled past the visiting team’s defender and, within the 18-yard box, powerfully shot the ball into the net from the upper left corner of the goal, breaking the stalemate. The first half ended with a score of one to zero. At the end of the game, the visiting team was defeated with a score of three to four.
    Before the match, the opening ceremony of the Ceylon Football Team’s visit to China was held. More than 20,000 people from Kunming City attended the match today.
    In addition, the Ceylon Football Team arrived in Kunming on the 16th at the invitation of the All-China Sports Federation for a visit to our country.
