Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 28th: Yemen's King Imam Ahmad sent an urgent letter to Nasser on the 28th through Yemen's Deputy Foreign Minister in Cairo, Hassan bin Ibrahim.

According to the Middle East News Agency, Vice President Amer, representing Nasser, received the letter and spoke with the Yemeni Deputy Minister for forty minutes on the issue of British aggression against southern Yemen. They discussed the British occupation of the Lahej region and the concentration of British troops in areas west of the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait in southern Yemen.

The Middle East News Agency reported that Yemen and the United Arab Republic are closely studying the developments in southern Yemen and will take necessary measures to safeguard the peace and security of Yemen and its southern regions.

The Middle East News Agency also said that Yemen has instructed its representative to the United Nations to notify the Security Council of the developments.

Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Aden News: British authorities dispatched a batch of reinforcements to the west of the so-called British "Aden Protectorate" on the 28th in an attempt to rescue Somerset, the British "Assistant Political Resident" stationed in the Zara Emirate, who was besieged in the Yasariel Fortress. Zara is one of the twenty-three emirates within the so-called British "Aden Protectorate," originally Yemeni territory.

It is reported that in Lahej, another emirate recently attacked by British colonialists, several nationalists successfully crossed the heavily guarded British border and fled to Yemen. Among them are the Minister of Agriculture of Lahej and a court poet.

    商讨对付英国侵略问题
    据新华社开罗28日电　也门国王伊马姆·艾哈迈德28日通过也门在开罗的外交副大臣哈桑·本·易卜拉欣递给纳赛尔一封紧急信。
    据中东通讯社说，代表纳赛尔接受这封信的副总统阿密尔，同这位也门副大臣就英国侵略也门南部问题谈了四十分钟。他们讨论了英国侵占拉赫杰地区和英国军队在也门南部巴布厄尔曼得峡西边等地集中的问题。
    中东通讯社报道，也门和阿拉伯联合共和国正在密切研究也门南部局势的发展，并将采取必要措施来维护也门和它南部地区的和平与安全。
    中东通讯社还说，也门已经训令它驻联合国的代表把局势的发展通知安全理事会。
    据新华社29日讯　亚丁消息：英国当局在28日赶派了一批援军前往所谓英国“亚丁保护地”西部，以图援救被困在亚萨里尔要塞里面的英国驻扎拉酋长国“助理政治驻札官”索默塞特。扎拉是原为也门领土的所谓英国“亚丁保护地”内二十三个酋长国中的一个。
    据报道，在最近遭到英国殖民者进攻的另一酋长国拉赫杰，又有民族主义者多名成功地越过英军戒备森严的边界逃到也门去。他们中间有拉赫杰的农业大臣和一名宫庭诗人。
