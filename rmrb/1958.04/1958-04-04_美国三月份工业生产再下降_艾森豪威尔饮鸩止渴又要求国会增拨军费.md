Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd -- According to TASS, New York, April 2nd: Preliminary data published in American newspapers indicates that production in many sectors of American industry continued to decline in March.

The most significant production declines in March occurred in the automotive and petroleum industries.

Automobile production in March decreased by approximately 7% compared to February. It is expected that automobile production will continue to decline in the coming months.

Crude oil production in March decreased by 8% compared to February. According to official announcements, Texas, which accounts for 40% of the country's oil production, will further reduce production by 4% in April compared to March.

Bituminous coal production remains at a very low level. From January to March 22nd, a total of 90,971,000 tons of coal were mined, compared to 116,342,000 tons in the same period last year.

The average operating rate of the steel industry in March was only 52.2%, compared to 53.6% in February. According to press reports, the operating rate of ferrous metallurgical enterprises will be only 48% this week.

Due to a decrease in new steel orders, steel companies have had to continue to reduce production. This weekend, "U.S. Steel" will close its plant in Clayton for at least a month and will significantly reduce production at its plant in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. "National Steel" is closing its Detroit-area plant for three weeks. Recently, the operating rate of steel plants in the Detroit area has been only 25%.

The "Journal of Commerce" pointed out that the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry is encountering great difficulties. Usually, the demand for tractors and other agricultural machinery and implements is very high in February and March, but now, due to the overall economic recession, companies in these sectors are reducing production. For example, "International Harvester" has reduced tractor production by 11%.

Due to the overall economic recession, electricity production has also begun to decline.

The volume of trade in department stores decreased by approximately 4% in March, and the volume of railway transportation and motor vehicle transportation is also decreasing.

Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd, Washington: U.S. President Eisenhower on the 2nd requested Congress to increase military appropriations by $1.455 billion for the manufacture of missiles, hydrogen bomb bombers, and submarines capable of launching missiles.

This is the latest in a series of appropriation increase requests submitted by the U.S. government in order to cope with the economic recession. If this appropriation is approved by Congress, it will bring the U.S. military budget for the 1959 fiscal year to over $41 billion. The original military expenditure stipulated in the government's budget was $39.8 billion.

The Air Force received the largest allocation of this new appropriation, amounting to $518.4 million.

On the same day, Eisenhower also submitted a bill to Congress requesting early approval for the establishment of a space research agency.

    美国三月份工业生产再下降
    艾森豪威尔饮鸩止渴又要求国会增拨军费
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约2日讯：从美国报刊所发表的初步资料看来，3月份美国很多工业部门的生产在继续缩减。
    3月份生产缩减得最厉害的是汽车工业和石油工业。
    3月份汽车生产比2月份大约减少7％。预料最近几个月内汽车生产会继续减少。
    3月份石油产量比2月份降低了8％。据官方宣布，产油量占全国40％的得克萨斯州4月份产量将比3月份再减少4％。
    烟煤产量继续处于很低的水平。从1月到3月22日总共开采了九千零九十七万一千吨煤，而去年同期为一亿一千六百三十四万两千吨。
    3月份炼钢工业开工率平均只有52.2％，而2月份是53.6％。据报刊报道，本周黑色冶金企业的开工率将只有48％。
    由于钢的新订货减少，钢铁公司不得不继续减少生产。本周末“美国钢铁公司”要把它在克莱敦的企业至少关闭一个月，并要在麦克斯波特（宾夕法尼亚州）的企业中大量减少生产。“全国钢铁公司”把它在底特律地区的工厂关闭三个星期。最近底特律的炼钢企业开工率只有25％。
    “商务日报”指出，农业机器制造业正遭遇着很大的困难。通常在2、3月份对拖拉机等农业机器和农具的需要总是很大，但是现在由于整个经济衰退，这些部门的公司正在减少生产。例如，“国际收割机公司”的拖拉机生产减少了11％。
    由于整个经济衰退，电力生产也开始下降。
    3月份百货商店的贸易额大约减少了4％，铁路运输装卸量和汽车运输量也在减少。
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔2日要求国会增加十四亿五千五百万美元的军事拨款，用来制造导弹、氢弹轰炸机和能够发射导弹的潜水艇。
    这是美国政府为了应付经济衰退而相继提出的增加拨款要求中最新的一笔。这笔拨款如果得到国会批准，将使美国1959财政年度的军事预算超过四百一十亿美元。政府原来预算中规定的军费是三百九十八亿美元。
    这笔新拨款中空军分配到的最多，达五亿一千八百四十万美元。
    艾森豪威尔同一天还向国会提出一项法案，要求国会尽早批准建立空间研究机构。
