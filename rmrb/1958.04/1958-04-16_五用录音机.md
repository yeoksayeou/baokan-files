    Five-Use Tape Recorder
    Ma Wenming, a high school graduate from Xuzhou City, has recently successfully trial-produced a five-use tape recorder. This tape recorder can not only record and play audio, but also receive radio broadcasts, record radio broadcasts, play records, record records, and function as a loudspeaker. After testing, the recorded sound can be played back clearly, and the playback speed can be easily changed.

    This five-use tape recorder has twelve vacuum tubes and three small motors inside, all made from recycled materials. This year, the Yunlong District Electrical Repair Shop where Ma Wenming works plans to officially produce fifty units.

    五用录音机
    徐州市高中毕业生马文明最近试制成功一种五用录音机。这种录音机不但可以录音、放音，并且能收听广播、转录广播、播送唱片、转录唱片和作扩音器。经过试用，录的音能清晰地放出来，放音速度可以很方便地变换。
    这架五用录音机内部有十二只电子管和三只小型马达，全部是利用废旧材料制成的。今年，马文明所在的云龙区电器修配社准备正式生产五十台。
