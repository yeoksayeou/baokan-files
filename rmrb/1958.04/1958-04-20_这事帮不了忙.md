Title: This Cannot Be Helped

　　Neighborhood committee member Aunt Liang from the 24th Alley is always so warm-hearted. If anyone in the neighborhood asks her for help, she never refuses. A couple of days ago, she was busy trying to find a job for a young woman, and even asked me, "Sister Yang, if you know of any family looking for a nanny, please introduce Hu to them!" I made some inquiries and found out that Hu came to Beijing from Anhui last year and hasn't registered for a household registration. She always manages to work for ten days to half a month at one household and then go to another for a few days of odd jobs. When the comrades from the police station urge her to go home, she tries to "transfer" elsewhere. That's how she's been getting by in Beijing for over half a year. I heard that her family has also written letters urging her to go back, but she craves city life and stubbornly refuses to return to her hometown.

　　I can't agree to Aunt Liang's request. The government is mobilizing the population who have blindly flowed into the cities to return to their hometowns for production. We should act in accordance with the government's policies. Can we violate national policy just to do someone a personal favor?

　　Speaking of the government's policies, everyone will say that the current government's actions are all for the benefit of the entire country and the people. Taking the matter of letting those who should return to the countryside for production as an example, isn't it the same principle?

　　Agricultural production is undergoing a great leap forward. Commune members are getting up early and working late to repair canals and build dams. Everyone is working hard to build a socialist countryside. If those young and strong people who are familiar with farm work could also return, wouldn't that add a large number of laborers to the countryside? These people staying in the city also increases the burden on the country. Grain, vegetables, housing… the country has to spend extra effort to supply them. What's worse is that some people can't find legitimate work for a while and resort to speculation and theft, affecting social order.

　　Returning to the countryside for production is even more beneficial to oneself. The state handles affairs with planning. How can one person from the countryside be assigned a job as soon as they arrive? Without a job, one has to rely on relatives and friends, living off them, or like Hu, worrying about work every other day, with an unstable life and income that's here today and gone tomorrow. If one returns to the countryside for production, it can not only reduce the burden on relatives and friends but also guarantee one's own income, which is beneficial to others, oneself, and the country. So many benefits in one action, what's not to like?

    这事帮不了忙
    杨萱
    二十四号里的梁大妈老是那么一副热心肠，街坊们有啥事求她，没有个不肯帮忙的。前两天，她又张罗着给一位年轻的大嫂找工作，还托我说：“杨大姐，您要是知道谁家要找保姆，给那位胡大嫂介绍介绍吧！”我仔细一打听，原来胡大嫂去年就从安徽乡下来北京了，一直没有报上户口，总是在东家凑合十天半月，又到西家去打几天短工，派出所的同志一催她回家，她就设法“转移”。就这么着，在北京混了大半年。听说她家里也写信催她回去，可她贪图城里生活，硬是不想回乡。
    这件事，我可不能应承梁大妈的托咐。政府正在动员盲目流入城市的人口还乡生产，咱们应该按照政府的政策办事，能为了作个人情就违反国家政策吗？
    说到政府的政策，大家都会说现在的政府办事都是为了整个国家和人民的利益。就拿让那些该回农村生产的人回乡来说吧，不也是这个道理？
    农业生产正在大跃进，社员们个个都在起早贪黑地修渠筑坝，人人苦战，建设社会主义农村。设若那些年轻力壮、原来就熟悉农活的人也都能回去，不是给农村增加了一大批劳动力吗？这些人老呆在城里，也加重了国家的负担，什么粮食、蔬菜、住房……都要国家额外费一些劲来供应他们。更糟糕的是有些人一时找不到正当的职业，就干起投机、偷盗的事儿来，影响了社会治安。
    回乡生产，对自己的好处就更大。国家办事都有计划，哪能从农村来一个人就给安排一个工作？没有工作，只得投亲靠友，寄食于人，要不就像胡大嫂那样三天两头地为工作发愁，生活不安定，收入也是有一天缺一天的。如果回乡生产，既可减轻亲友负担，又能保证自己的收入，于人、于己、于国家都有利。一举数得，真是何乐而不为呢？
