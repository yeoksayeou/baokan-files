    Jinggangshan 30 Type Tractor
    The state-owned Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory successfully trial-produced the "Jinggangshan 30" type thirty-horsepower four-wheel tractor on the 1st. This is another type of tractor suitable for paddy field cultivation that the factory has successfully trial-produced following the trial production of the "May 1-05" type walking tractor. Because this tractor is relatively light, the tires do not sink deeply, and it turns flexibly, it can also cultivate in small paddy fields. It can drive machinery for power generation, water pumping, sawing wood, and drilling holes for planting trees, and can haul things weighing two thousand kilograms.

    井冈山30型拖拉机
    国营南昌柴油机厂在1日试制成功“井冈山30”型三十马力四轮拖拉机，这是这个厂继试制“五一—05”型手扶拖拉机后试制成功的又一种适合水田耕作的拖拉机。这台拖拉机由于较轻，轮胎下陷不深，转弯灵便，在小块水田中也能耕作。它可以带动发电、水泵、锯木、打洞栽树等机械，并可拖运二千公斤重的东西。
