Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, April 23rd: The Urumqi Youth Canal, built by youths of thirteen nationalities including Han, Uygur, Kazakh, and Uzbek in Urumqi City through one hundred and thirty-one days of voluntary labor, was completed six days ahead of schedule on the 21st. This 32-kilometer-long canal is located at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains in the southeast of Urumqi City. Its total annual flow reaches 70 million cubic meters, which can turn 200,000 mu of arid wasteland into fertile land.

At the end of the canal, a 3-meter-high monument is under intense construction to commemorate the glorious labor of the youths of thirteen nationalities, and is scheduled to be unveiled on the "May Fourth" Youth Day when the Youth Canal officially releases water.

    据新华社乌鲁木齐23日电　乌鲁木齐市汉、维吾尔、哈萨克、乌孜别克等十三个民族的青年用一百三十一天的义务劳动修建的乌鲁木齐青年渠，已经提前六天在21日完工。这条全长三十二公里的渠道位于乌鲁木齐市东南部天山脚下，全年总流量达七千万公方，可以把二十万亩干旱荒滩变成良田。
    在渠道的尽头，为了纪念十三个民族的青年的光辉劳动，一座高三公尺的纪念碑正在紧张修建，准备在“五四”青年节青年渠正式放水的时候揭幕。
