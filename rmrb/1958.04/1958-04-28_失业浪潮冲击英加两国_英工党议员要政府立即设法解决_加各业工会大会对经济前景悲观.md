Xinhua News Agency, April 27th - According to TASS, London, April 26th: The continuous increase in unemployment is causing increasingly strong unease in Britain.

On the 25th, the unemployment problem was brought up again in the British House of Commons. Labour MP Moody emphasized that the increase in the number of unemployed will cause serious consequences, and he demanded that urgent measures be taken to solve the unemployment problem. Moody proposed a motion demanding that the government immediately put forward a plan to solve the unemployment problem.

Because many Conservatives also supported this motion by the Labour MP, Labor Minister Macleod had no choice but to agree to the motion.

Currently, the number of unemployed in Britain accounts for 2% of the total number of registered workers. The situation in Northern Ireland is particularly serious, where the number of unemployed already accounts for 10.8% of all workers.

Xinhua News Agency, April 27th - According to TASS, Winnipeg, April 26th: The national representative conference of the "Canadian Trades and Labour Congress," which began on April 22nd, has concluded. This largest trade union federation in the country has 1,150,000 members, accounting for more than four-fifths of all organized workers in Canada.

This conference was held amidst the deepening economic recession and increasing unemployment in Canada. According to statistics from the Canadian Labour and Employment Bureau, as of March 20th, the number of people without work in Canada accounted for 15% of the total national labor force, reaching the highest number since the economic crisis of the 1930s. At the same time, production in many industrial sectors in Canada is also constantly shrinking. All of these issues that make the Canadian working people feel uneasy cannot but be reflected at the meeting. The resolution on economic policy adopted at the meeting stated that although the government has taken some measures attempting to increase the number of employed, "the economic situation remains very serious, the unemployment figures are very high, and it seems that this will be the case throughout this year, and even next year. The current recession is not only more serious than last year, but may also last longer."

    失业浪潮冲击英加两国
    英工党议员要政府立即设法解决
    加各业工会大会对经济前景悲观
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社伦敦26日讯：失业人数的不断增加在英国引起了越来越强烈的不安。
    25日，失业问题在英国下院被重新提出来了。工党议员穆迪着重指出，失业人数的增加将引起严重的后果，他要求采取紧急措施解决失业问题。穆迪提出一项动议，要求政府立即提出解决失业问题的计划。
    由于很多保守党人也支持工党议员这一动议，劳工大臣麦克劳德不得不同意这一动议。
    目前，英国失业人数占全部登记的工人总数的2％。北爱尔兰的情况特别严重，这里的失业人数已占全体工人的10.8％。
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社温尼伯26日讯：“加拿大各业工会大会”从4月22日起举行的全国代表会议已经闭幕。这个全国最大的工会联合会拥有会员一百一十五万人，占加拿大全部有组织的工人五分之四以上。
    这次会议是在加拿大经济衰退加深和失业增加的情况下举行的，据加拿大劳工就业局统计，到3月20日为止，加拿大没有工作的人占全国劳动力总数的15％，达到三十年代经济危机以来的最高数目。同时，加拿大许多工业部门的生产也在不断缩减中。所有这些使加拿大劳动人民感到不安的问题不能不在会上反映出来。会议通过的关于经济政策的决议说，尽管政府采取了一些企图增加就业人数的措施，但是“经济情况仍然非常严重，失业数字很大，看来今年一年的情况都会这样，甚至明年也会这样。目前的衰退不仅比去年严重，而且可能持续更久”。
