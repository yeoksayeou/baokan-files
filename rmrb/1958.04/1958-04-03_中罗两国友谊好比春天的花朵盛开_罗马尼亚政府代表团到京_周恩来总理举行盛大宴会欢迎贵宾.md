In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai thanked the distinguished guests for bringing the Romanian people's fraternal friendship to the Chinese people. He said: "The Romanian people have always been faithful to the great principles of proletarian internationalism and have made outstanding contributions to strengthening the unity and cooperation of the socialist countries' great family headed by the Soviet Union. In international affairs, the Romanian People's Republic has unswervingly pursued a peaceful foreign policy and has made tremendous efforts in developing economic and cultural ties between countries, strengthening friendship between peoples, and safeguarding peace in Europe and the world." Premier Zhou especially mentioned the proposal put forward by the government of the Romanian People's Republic last September regarding the convening of a high-level conference of Balkan countries and the signing of a common agreement guaranteeing peace and prosperity in the Balkan region. He said: "The Chinese government, as it has repeatedly stated in the past, fully supports this reasonable proposal of the government of the Romanian People's Republic and believes that its realization is of great significance for maintaining peace in Europe."

Premier Zhou said: "Practice has proven that our friendly mutual assistance greatly contributes to the common cause of building socialism in our two countries. The Chinese people, like the Romanian people, will do everything possible to further strengthen the friendly and mutually beneficial relations between our two countries."

Premier Zhou finally wished that "the friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples will be as evergreen as pine and cypress, and bloom like spring flowers on the land of our two countries."

In his speech, Chairman Chivu Stoica warmly praised the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction. He said: "Our two countries—members of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union—are contributing our strength to consolidating the unity of this camp. This camp is the guarantee of progress for every socialist country and the pillar of peace throughout the world. Our two countries are resolutely implementing a policy of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation with all countries with different social systems." He pointed out: "The vast peace zone composed of socialist countries and many Asian and African countries is playing a huge role in opposing the imperialists' policy of aggression and in defeating the imperialists' attempts to maintain and restore their past colonial rule."
