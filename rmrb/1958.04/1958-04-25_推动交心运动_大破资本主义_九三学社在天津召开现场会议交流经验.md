Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 23rd. The Central Committee of the Jiusan Society held an on-site work conference in Tianjin on the 20th and 21st. Responsible persons from local organizations in Tianjin, Guangzhou, Tangshan, and other places introduced the situation and experiences of carrying out the "heart-to-heart" movement at the meeting.

The experience of local organizations such as the Tianjin branch of the Jiusan Society proves that only by opening one's heart to the Party and the people, exposing all the ugly thoughts of the bourgeoisie, thoroughly disinfecting them, and radically destroying capitalism can we radically establish socialism. Therefore, opening one's heart to the Party and the people is a decisive step for bourgeois intellectuals to fundamentally transform their political stance. After the rectification movement, members of the Tianjin Jiusan Society were educated and clarified major issues of right and wrong in politics. However, when the rectification movement further developed in depth and touched on practical issues of individual ideological transformation, many people became less enthusiastic. In order to eliminate these ideological obstacles, the leadership of the Tianjin branch of the Jiusan Society, under the guidance and assistance of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, adopted the method of presenting ideas and facts. Everyone put their ideological state and specific manifestations in several stages, such as before and after joining the society, and during the anti-Rightist struggle, on the table. As a result, it became clear that bourgeois ideology and stand were stubbornly manifested in different people at different times and places in different ways. Therefore, everyone was convinced and admitted that they were bourgeois intellectuals. Then everyone presented their views and started a debate. Finally, everyone concluded that their current political attitude and class stand are incompatible with the current socialist situation. If they do not resolutely remove the ideological tumors of the bourgeoisie, they risk taking the road against the people. Therefore, they urgently demanded to transform themselves.

Many people experienced painful ideological struggles. After exposing their wrong ideas, they felt relieved. Some said that after confessing these many ideological situations, it was equivalent to setting up a "last stand" for themselves. From now on, they can only move forward and cannot retreat. Because everyone examined their own individualism, many past problems of disunity were also resolved this time. Many people corrected their views on the Party and actively took the initiative to get closer to the Party. For example, a famous orthopedic expert felt relieved after pouring out his heart and wrote a letter to his daughter studying at Tsinghua University, asking her to overcome individualism and apply to join the Youth League. He also proposed to compete with his daughter to see who progresses faster. Many medical staff members of the society went to factories and rural areas to provide medical care for workers and peasants and actively participated in labor training.

The Jiusan Society's on-site rectification work conference was attended by responsible persons from local organizations in thirteen cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. They also adopted a self-transformation competition agreement at the meeting.

    推动交心运动　大破资本主义
    九三学社在天津召开现场会议交流经验
    据新华社天津23日电　九三学社中央委员会20、21两日在天津召开整风工作现场会议。天津、广州、唐山等地方组织的负责人在会上介绍了开展交心运动的情况和经验。
    九三学社的天津分社等地方组织的经验证明：向党向人民交心，把资产阶级的丑恶思想全部暴露出来，进行彻底的消毒，大破资本主义，才能大立社会主义。因此，向党向人民交心是资产阶级知识分子根本改造政治立场的具有决定意义的一步。天津的九三学社社员经过整风运动，受到了教育，在政治上明确了大是大非。但是当整风运动进一步向深透发展，接触到个人思想改造的实际问题时，许多人就情绪不高，劲头不大。为了扫除这些思想障碍，九三学社天津分社的领导，在中共天津市委的指导和帮助下，采取了摆思想、摆事实的方法，大家把自己入社前后、反右派斗争中等几个阶段中的思想状况和具体表现摆到桌面上来，结果，清楚地看出，资产阶级思想和立场总是在不同时间和地点，以不同的方式在各人的身上顽强地表现出来。于是大家口服心服，承认了自己是资产阶级知识分子。接着大家再摆看法，展开辩论。最后，大家得出的结论是：目前他们各个人的政治态度和阶级立场是跟当前的社会主义形势不相容的，如果不坚决割除资产阶级的思想毒瘤，就有走向反人民道路的危险，因而迫切要求改造自己。
    许多人经历了痛苦的思想斗争，把错误的思想暴露出来以后，都有一种心情舒畅的感觉。有人说他交出了这许多思想情况以后，等于给自己摆了“背水阵”，今后只能前进，不能后退。由于大家都检查了自己的个人主义思想，过去许多不团结的问题这次也得到了解决。不少人端正了对党的看法，积极主动地向党靠拢了。如一位著名的骨科专家交心之后就感到心情舒畅，给他在清华大学念书的女儿写了一封信，要她克服个人主义，申请入团。还提议和女儿竞赛：看谁进步的快。许多医务界的社员，下厂下乡为工农看病，积极参加劳动锻炼。
    参加九三学社这个整风工作现场会议的有北京、上海、广州等十三城市地方组织的负责人。他们在会上还通过了一项自我改造竞赛协议书。
