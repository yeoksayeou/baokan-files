Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, Paris Dispatch: The government crisis in France poses a new threat to its financial difficulties.

    After the news of the Gaillard government's fall yesterday, the prices of French stocks on the Paris Stock Exchange immediately plummeted, with North African stocks and oil stocks falling particularly sharply; for example, some fell by three thousand francs. At the same time, the price of the franc also fell, while the prices of gold and the US dollar rose. The price of gold has risen by 15,000 francs per kilogram.
    People are worried that the crisis will also affect the scheduled issuance of 200 billion francs in government bonds at the end of this month.

    法国股票和法郎大跌价
    新华社17日讯　巴黎消息：法国的政府危机给财政困难带来新的威胁。
    在昨天盖伊阿政府倒台的消息传出来以后，巴黎证券交易所的法国股票价格立即猛跌，其中北非股票和石油股票跌得尤其厉害；例如，有的下跌了三千法郎。同时，法郎价格也下跌，而黄金和美元价格则上升。黄金价格每公斤已经上升了一万五千法郎。
    人们担心，危机还会影响原来规定要在本月底发行的二千亿法郎公债券的如期发行。
