Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 31st: In order to accelerate water conservancy construction in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces, a collaborative meeting was recently held in Zhengzhou. The meeting was attended by responsible persons from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission and the water conservancy departments of Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. Personnel from the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power also participated.

　　The meeting studied the situation and governance suggestions for the Wei River and Jing River, major tributaries of the Yellow River flowing through Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, as well as the Wuding River and Beiluo River in Shaanxi. It also arranged water conservancy construction projects for the Second Five-Year Plan. The meeting unanimously agreed that since last winter, significant achievements have been made in water conservancy construction in this area. In the future, in addition to continuing the large-scale construction of small water conservancy projects, large and medium-sized projects should also be built.

　　Based on the principles of comprehensive planning and zonal governance, the meeting decided that the governance of rivers would be the responsibility of each province. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission would be responsible for basin planning and large-scale projects (including larger medium-sized projects), with construction carried out by the provinces. The survey, design, and construction of small and medium-sized projects would be the responsibility of the provinces, with support from the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission when technical capacity is insufficient.

　　The meeting also decided that within two years, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission would survey and design six large-scale projects and fifteen medium-sized projects. The provinces would be responsible for surveying and designing more than ten medium-sized projects. This year, the survey and design work for large-scale projects such as the Fengjiashan on the Wei River, the Bajiazui on the Pu River (a tributary of the Jing River), the Laohugou on the Malian River (a tributary of the Jing River), and the Longwangtai headgate of the Yintao River should be completed. Next year, the survey and design work for large-scale projects such as the Baoji Gorge on the Wei River, the Dafosi and Diaoerzui on the Jing River, and the Longwangtai dam should be completed.

　　The Wei River, Jing River, Wuding River, and Beiluo River are major tributaries of the Yellow River and also tributaries with the largest sediment transport volume. The Wei River, Jing River, and Wuding River alone transport 591.7 million cubic meters of sediment into the Yellow River annually. Accelerating the governance and development of these rivers will have a significant impact on the development of agriculture in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and on extending the lifespan of the Sanmenxia Reservoir in the future.

    全面规划　分区治理
    甘肃陕西协作治水
    新华社郑州31日电　为了加速甘肃和陕西两省的水利建设，最近在郑州举行了一次协作会议。参加会议的有黄河水利委员会和甘肃、陕西两省水利部门的负责人，水利电力部也派人参加。
    会议研究了流贯陕西、甘肃两省的黄河大支流渭河、泾河及陕西的无定河、北洛河的情况和治理意见，安排了第二个五年计划中的水利建设工程。会议一致认为，从去年冬季到现在，这一带水利建设已作出很大成绩，今后除了继续大修小型水利工程以外，也要兴建大、中型工程。
    会议根据全面规划、分区治理的原则，决定河流的治理归各省负责；流域规划和大型工程（包括较大的中型工程）的勘测设计由黄河水利委员会负责，由各省施工；中小型工程的勘测设计和施工，由各省负责，技术力量不足时，由黄河水利委员会支援。
    会议还决定在两年内，由黄河水利委员会勘测设计大型工程六处和中型工程十五处；由各省负责勘测设计中型工程十多处。今年要完成渭河上的冯家山、泾河支流蒲河巴家咀、泾河支流马连河老虎沟等水库以及引洮河的龙王台渠首闸等大型工程的勘测设计工作；明年完成渭河宝鸡峡、泾河上的大佛寺、吊儿咀及龙王台闸坝等大型工程的勘测设计工作。
    渭河、泾河、无定河、北洛河是黄河的大支流，也是输沙量最多的支流。每年只渭河、泾河、无定河就往黄河输沙五点九一七亿公方。这几条河的加速治理和开发，对于发展陕西、甘肃两省的农业和将来延长三门峡水库寿命，都将会发生巨大的作用。
