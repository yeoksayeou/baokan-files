Cheering the Great Leap Forward in Romania
—A Visit to the Romanian Economic Exhibition
By our correspondent Wang Zhuofei

The grand Romanian Economic Exhibition opened to Beijing audiences on the 28th. After touring the exhibition, people were amazed by the changes in Romania's national economic structure compared to pre-World War II Romania, and cheered for Romania's Great Leap Forward.

Romania is an oil-rich country, and people visited various new oil extraction equipment with great interest, as well as various by-products from the production process from crude oil to petroleum products. In the square next to the open-air theater of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, there is a brand-new oil drilling rig towering into the sky. This drilling rig comes from Romania's largest oil industry center—Ploiești. It is a new product manufactured this year and is one of the most advanced products in the world. The drilling rig, including the derrick, is as high as fifty meters, and the drilling depth is three thousand two hundred to three thousand five hundred meters. It is fully automated. With the push of a button, the forty-five-meter-high derrick can be gently lowered to the ground, and with another push, it can be quickly erected in two or three minutes. General drilling rigs use concrete as a base, but it uses wood, which is economical and convenient, and can operate in any climate and geographical condition. On a road next to this large derrick, there is a small oil drilling rig with a drilling depth of three hundred meters. The derrick base is a truck, which is very light and can be driven anywhere for drilling. Romania's crude oil production has greatly developed compared to 1938. Charts in the exhibition show that in 1938, Romania produced 6.6 million tons of crude oil, and in 1957, it produced 11.2 million tons. Calculated per capita, it was 422.7 kilograms per person in 1938 and more than 621 kilograms per person in 1957.

Since World War II, Romania has been leaping forward not only in the oil industry but also in other industries. Charts and exhibits at the exhibition tell people that the leap forward of Romania's national economy is reflected in the production per capita, which has reached a considerable level. Compared with 1938, Romania's production in 1957 was: steel increased from 18.2 kg to 44.3 kg; iron increased from 8.5 kg to 33.2 kg; electricity increased from 72.4 kWh to 280.4 kWh; and coal increased from 181.2 kg to 391.1 kg.

The achievements of Romania's heavy industry heart—the machine manufacturing industry—introduced at the exhibition aroused great interest among the audience. There are various kinds of machines here. Under the plastic canopy, there is a huge 3,000 kW, 6,300 V turbine generator for drilling. In the industrial hall, there are also various machine tools, electric welding machines, flour mixers, freezers, meat processing machines, and several electric sewing machines. This kind of sewing machine does not require foot pedaling or hand cranking. As long as the plug is inserted into the power outlet, the sewing machine can automatically sew. In the square outside the industrial hall, there are also automated unloading mine trucks, cargo trucks, and many kinds of tractors. Among them, a row of UTOS-45 tractors is the most eye-catching. This type of tractor is the latest in Romania, with 45 horsepower and ten speeds. This type of tractor can work in the fields and transport goods. People call it a universal tractor. Now, the level of mechanization of agricultural labor in Romania has been greatly improved. The number of tractors in 1957 increased seven times compared to 1938. In 1958, farmers used a total of 110,000 different kinds of agricultural machinery, including 28,500 tractors. Next to the tractors, there are also beautiful gliders and light ambulances on display. This ambulance has only one propeller and can seat three people: the driver, the nurse, and the patient. If residents in Romania need to see a doctor, they can go to the nearby airport to take this plane to the hospital they want to go to for treatment.

After visiting the industrial and agricultural machinery, people walk into another hall and first see various agricultural products. The technical director of the exhibition, Xiao Bolong, told reporters that in Romania, due to the widespread promotion of modern agricultural machinery, wheat production in 1957 increased by 34,000 tons compared to 1938, corn production increased by 2.3 million tons compared to 1938, sugar beet increased three times, and potatoes increased one time. Further ahead, people saw a large number of handicrafts, leather goods, textiles, clothing, sports equipment, musical instruments, furniture, and food. On a tower-shaped exhibition stand, various wines produced in Romania were placed below, and wild ducks and pheasants were placed on top. This display is unique and reflects Romanian national customs: Romanians like to eat wild ducks and pheasants when drinking strong liquor. If you only drink liquor without eating wild game, no matter how much you drink, it is not satisfying.

In these twenty years, Romania's cultural construction has also undergone rapid changes. The exhibition featured many charts showing the new achievements in Romania's cultural construction. Now, illiteracy has been eliminated in Romania. One out of every fifty residents is a middle school student, one out of every two hundred and fifty residents is a university student, and one out of every four hundred residents has a public library. There is also a chart in the exhibition noting that in 1938, Romania had an average of one doctor for every 1,895 people; in 1948, there was an average of one doctor for every 1,343 people; and in 1956, there was an average of one doctor for every 819 people. In 1938, Romania had only 3,500 clubs, and in 1957, there were 12,078 clubs.

After visiting the exhibition, the reporter met a Romanian expert. He excitedly told the reporter a meaningful story: In 1939, Romania even imported the simplest parts of oil machinery. At that time, a Romanian oil worker named Ștefănic plucked up the courage to suggest to the factory that Romanian workers manufacture some parts for oil machinery themselves. The managers ridiculed the workers, saying, "You are not worthy of making these things. Only the United States can make them." Ștefănic now works in a Romanian oil machinery factory. All the machinery in this factory is state-of-the-art, and the oil machinery produced is exported in large quantities. Ștefănic often tells people about being ridiculed by the managers in the past, "I feel like I am dreaming. It's only been twenty years, but it feels like a century has passed."

After hearing the expert's words, the reporter also felt proud of Romania's rapid progress. The Romanian workers were not dreaming. The changes in twenty years are indeed equivalent to a century because the Romanian working people are doing something that no one has done before—the cause of socialism. In these twenty years, the Romanian working people, with their liberated and diligent hands, have built a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial and agricultural country. The industrial output value has accounted for 60.4% of Romania's total output value. Now, Romania is in a period of comprehensive socialist leap forward. We believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, the Romanian working people will surely achieve new successes in the comprehensive leap forward. We will also cheer for Romania's new achievements.

    欢呼罗马尼亚大跃进
    ——罗马尼亚经济展览会参观记
    本报记者　王濯非
    规模巨大的罗马尼亚经济展览会已在28日开始接待北京的观众。人们在参观了展览会以后，想到第二次世界大战以前的罗马尼亚，都为罗马尼亚在国民经济结构上的变化感到惊奇，为罗马尼亚的大跃进欢呼。
    罗马尼亚是石油之国，人们怀着极大的兴趣参观了各种新式的开采石油的设备。从原油到石油成品的生产过程中的各种副产品。在苏联展览馆露天剧场旁边的广场上，有一架崭新的耸入高空的石油钻探机。这架钻探机来自罗马尼亚最大的石油工业中心——普罗什蒂，是今年出厂的新产品，也是世界上最先进的产品。这架钻探机连塔座在内高达五十公尺，钻探深度是三千二百到三千五百公尺。它全部自动化，高达四十五公尺的塔身，只要一按电钮就可以轻轻倒在地上，再按一下电钮，又可以在两三分钟内迅速地竖立起来。一般钻探机都是用混凝土作底座，而它是用木头做底座，既经济又简便，可以在任何气候和地理条件下作业。在这个大井架旁边的一条马路上，有一架小型的石油钻探机，钻探深度是三百公尺，塔座是一辆卡车，非常轻便，可以开到任何地方去钻探。罗马尼亚的原油生产较1938年已有了很大的发展。展览会上的图表标明：1938年，罗马尼亚生产原油六百六十万吨，1957年产一千一百二十万吨；按人口计算，1938年每人四百二十二点七公斤，1957年每人六百二十一多公斤。
    在第二次世界大战以后，罗马尼亚不仅在石油工业方面，在其他工业方面，也是一日千里地跃进。展览会上图表和展品告诉人们，罗马尼亚国民经济的跃进，反映在按人口平均计算的生产上已达到一个可观的水平。和1938年比较，罗马尼亚1957年的生产是：钢从十八点二公斤增长到四十四点三公斤；铁从八点五公斤增长到三十三点二公斤；电力从七十二点四瓩增长到二百八十点四瓩；煤从一百八十一点二公斤增长到三百九十一点一公斤。
    展览会上介绍的罗马尼亚重工业的心脏——机器制造业的成就，引起观众们极大的兴趣。这里有各种各样的机器。在塑料做的天篷下，有一架钻井用的三千瓩、六千三百伏安的巨大的涡轮发电机。在工业馆里还有各种机床、电焊机、面粉搅拌机、冷冻机、肉类加工机，还有几架电动缝纫机。这种缝纫机不用脚蹬手摇，只要把插销插在电门上，缝纫机就可以自动地缝纫。在工业馆外的广场上，还有自动化卸车的矿山货车、载重汽车和许多种类的拖拉机。其中有一排UTOS—45型拖拉机最引人注目，这种拖拉机在罗马尼亚是最新式的，有四十五马力，十个速度；这种拖拉机可以在田间工作，也可以运输，人们叫它为万能拖拉机。现在罗马尼亚农业劳动的机械化程度已大大提高，1957年的拖拉机数比1938年增长了七倍。1958年农民们使用的共有十一万部各种不同的农业机械，其中有二万八千五百台拖拉机。在拖拉机旁边，还展出了漂亮的滑翔机和轻便的救护机。这种救护机只有一个螺旋桨，它可以坐三个人：驾驶员、护士、病人。罗马尼亚的居民们如需要看病，可以到附近的机场上去乘坐这种飞机，到病人所要去的医院里去治疗。
    人们参观了工农业机械以后，走进另一个馆，首先看到的是各种农产品。这个展览会的技术主任萧博隆告诉记者：在罗马尼亚，由于广泛地推广了现代化农业机械，1957年小麦产量比1938年增加三点四万吨，玉米产量比1938年增加二百三十万吨，甜菜增加了三倍，马铃薯增加了一倍。再往前走，人们看到了大量的手工业品、皮制品、纺织品、服装、运动用具、乐器、家具、食品。在一个塔形的展览台上，下面放着罗马尼亚出产的各种酒类，顶上放着野鸭、山鸡。这种摆设是别致的，表现了罗马尼亚的民族习惯：罗马尼亚人在喝烈性酒时，都喜欢吃野鸭、山鸡，如果只喝酒不吃野味，你喝的酒再多，也不过瘾。
    在这二十年中，罗马尼亚的文化建设也有突飞猛进的变化。展览会上展出了许多图表，表明了罗马尼亚文化建设的新成就。现在罗马尼亚的文盲已经扫除了，每五十个居民中有一个中学生，每二百五十个居民中有一个大学生，每四百个居民中有一个公共图书馆，展览会上还有一幅图表注明，1938年，罗马尼亚平均一千八百九十五人才有一个医师，到1948年，平均一千三百四十三个人中有一个医师；到1956年，平均八百一十九人中有一个医师。1938年，罗马尼亚只有三千五百个俱乐部，1957年已有一万二千零七十八个俱乐部。
    记者在参观了展览会以后，遇到了一位罗马尼亚专家。他兴奋地向记者谈了一件有意义的事情：在1939年，罗马尼亚连石油机械中最简单的零件都是进口的。那时，罗马尼亚有一石油工人士特凡尼克鼓着勇气向厂方建议由罗马尼亚工人自己制造一些石油机械的零件。经理们嘲笑工人说：你们不配做这些东西，只有美国才能制造。士特凡尼克现在在罗马尼亚一家石油机械厂工作。这个厂的全部机械都是最新式的，生产的石油机械还大批地出口。士特凡尼克想起过去被经理们嘲笑的事情常常对人说，我好像在做梦，时间只有二十年，但我好像已经过了一个世纪。
    记者听了这位专家的话后，也为罗马尼亚的突飞猛进感到骄傲。罗马尼亚的工人没有做梦，二十年的变化的确是等于一个世纪，因为罗马尼亚的劳动人民是在做着前人所未做的事业——社会主义事业。在这二十年中，罗马尼亚的劳动人民，用解放了的勤劳的双手，把一个落后的农业国建设成为一个先进的工农业国家，工业产值已占罗马尼亚全部产值的60.4％。现在罗马尼亚正处在社会主义全面跃进时期，我们相信，罗马尼亚的劳动人民在党和政府的领导下，在全面跃进中一定会取得新的成就。我们也将要为罗马尼亚的新成就而欢呼。
