Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th - In discussing the American economic situation on the 9th, Eisenhower attempted to conceal the severity of the crisis. He said that after studying the "history of economic depressions," he found that this "is not abnormal," but rather "can be said to be normal." When reporters asked how long it would take for the "anti-recession" measures taken by the U.S. government to have an impact on the recession, Eisenhower did not strike as high a tone as before, saying that he "really cannot make a prediction about this matter."

A reporter pointed out that AFL-CIO President Meany believes that the recent unemployment figures mean a deepening of the recession rather than a slowing down of the recession. The reporter asked Eisenhower what he thought. The U.S. President expressed disagreement with this view, but could not explain why. Eisenhower also avoided answering when taxes would be cut. He said he did not think it was necessary to take immediate emergency action.

The reporter mentioned that Japan is concerned about U.S. trade policy. Due to the economic crisis in the United States, calls for restricting imports of Japanese goods have become increasingly strong recently. Eisenhower acknowledged that Japan is "closely watching" the development of the U.S. policy of raising tariff barriers. He said that Japan must be allowed "to conduct some trade" with the United States. He also said that he personally believes that it is "necessary" for Japan "to conduct some clever and necessary trade with the Asian continent." Eisenhower also insisted that the United States would still conduct a series of nuclear weapons tests this spring and summer. This is the second consecutive day that U.S. decision-makers have declared the U.S. policy of adhering to nuclear testing.

The reporter followed up, asking whether the United States would announce a halt to nuclear testing after this series of tests. Eisenhower vaguely replied, "It depends on the situation at that time."

    面对日益严重的经济危机
    艾森豪威尔调子低沉
    承认不能预测“反衰退”的效果
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔9日在谈到美国经济局势时企图掩饰危机的严重性。他说，他在研究了“经济萧条的历史以后”，发现这“不是不正常的”，而可以说“倒是正常的”。当记者问到美国政府采取的“反衰退”措施要多长时间才能对衰退产生影响时，艾森豪威尔不像以前那样唱高调，他说，他“的确不能对这件事情进行预测”。
    有记者指出，劳联—产联主席米尼认为最近的失业数字意味着衰退的加深而不是意味着衰退的缓和。记者问艾森豪威尔怎样看。美国总统表示不同意这种看法，但是又说不出所以然。艾森豪威尔还避免回答什么时候减税。他说，他认为没有必要马上采取紧急行动。
    记者谈到日本对美国的贸易政策感到忧虑。由于美国遭遇经济危机，国内要求限制日本货物进口的叫嚷近来越来越强烈。艾森豪威尔承认，日本“密切注意”美国加高关税壁垒政策的发展。他说，必须让日本同美国“进行一些贸易”。他还说，他个人认为，日本“同亚洲大陆进行某种聪明的、必需的贸易是有必要的”。艾森豪威尔还坚持美国今年春夏两季仍然要进行一连串核武器试验。这是美国决策人接连第二天申明美国坚持核试验的政策。
    记者追问，在这一连串试验后，美国是否会宣布停止核试验。艾森豪威尔含糊其词地回答说，“必须看那时的情况而定。”
