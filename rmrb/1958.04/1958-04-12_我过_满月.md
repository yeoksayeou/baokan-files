As a cadre transferred to the countryside by the Ministry of Culture, today marks exactly one month since I became a new peasant.

Waking up early, the weather was warm and my mood was very cheerful. I wondered what would “celebrate” my “one-month anniversary”? As soon as the production team leader stepped over the threshold, he said, "Today, we're making fertilizer." The work point recorder, looking at me, immediately added, "Old Bai, are you doing it today?" "Of course!" I replied straightforwardly. To be honest, I didn't know the details of "making fertilizer" at the time. I figured it was just a matter of physical labor.

The commune members arrived at the threshing ground one after another. Gray manure, yellow manure, and river mud were already laid out there. The commune members first spread the river mud on top of the yellow and gray manure. Then, the men went to carry urine and water to pour on the mud, while the women took off their straw sandals, rolled up their trouser legs, and stepped in to trample it all. The manure and mud completely submerged their knees. Then, it was my turn. I was still standing by the edge of the threshing ground wearing my shoes and socks. Everyone's eyes turned to me in unison, their eyes seeming to hold a question mark. I was indeed a little hesitant. I had encountered difficulties several times before, such as carrying river mud at night beside the ditch at the risk of falling into the water, taking off my cotton shoes in the cold weather to go into the river, and going to the county town to carry yellow manure for the first time, etc. At those times, I had also hesitated, but with a surge of energy and gritted teeth, I overcame them. Today's matter seemed even more difficult for me than those, but facing these eyes, I finally decided to accept this test. When I took off my shoes and socks, rolled up my trouser legs, and my pair of white feet finally stepped into the mixed manure, I believed that I was truly standing together with my peasant brothers.

Spoonful after spoonful of thick, greenish urine was poured continuously onto the river mud and yellow manure. People's feet stepped up and down in the mixed manure, making a "splattering" sound. The evenly trampled mixed manure showed a dark, oily sheen. At this time, two young commune members standing next to me, half-jokingly and half-mockingly, wanted to pull me to the place where the yellow manure was the thickest to trample. I didn't show weakness. Since I had made up my mind to step into the manure, did I still care about thick or thin? But just as I was about to go over to trample, my landlady came out and said, "It's fine just over here!" Her sharp voice immediately subdued the two young men. Then, Uncle Zhao, who lived opposite my house, handed me a shovel, asking me to hold onto the shovel while I trampled, to avoid slipping. He said to the commune members, "If everyone is willing to work like Old Bai, not to mention 1,200, we can harvest 1,500 jin!" The two commune members who had been joking earlier also came to advise me, when stepping down, to go down slowly, as going too fast could easily get hurt by broken tiles.

In the evening, the fertilizer was made. The female commune members all crowded to the stream to wash their feet, leaving only a few male commune members at the threshing ground to do the finishing work. An old farmer asked me, "You've worked hard! After these mixed manures are dried in the sun in a few days, they can be carried to fertilize the fields." At this time, a pleasant surge of heat after labor flooded my heart.

Before going to bed, several commune members came to visit me. They asked with a smile, "Did you wash your feet with scented soap?"

That night, I thought about everything today. This hurdle is probably the real beginning of my emotional transformation.

    我过“满月”
    文化部下放干部  白崇义
    到农村来当新农民今天恰好满一个月。
    清早起来，天气很暖和，我的心情很舒畅，不知“庆祝”我的“满月”的将是什么？生产队长一踏进门槛，就说：“今天造肥料。”记工员在旁边望望我，立刻接上一句：“老白今天做不做？”“当然做！”我干脆地回答。说实在的，我当时并不知道“造肥料”的底细。想着反正不过是出力气罢了。
    社员们陆续来到场头了。灰粪、黄粪和河泥已经摆好在那里。社员们先把河泥铺到黄粪和灰粪上，然后男子们去挑尿挑水来浇到泥上，妇女们便脱掉草鞋，挽起裤腿，踏进去踩起来。粪和泥足足地淹没到她们的膝盖。这时，该轮到我了，我还穿着鞋袜站在场头边。大家的眼睛都不约而同地转向我，眼睛里好像都有一个问号。我的确有些犹豫，这以前我也曾碰到过几次困难，譬如黑夜在水沟边上冒着跌进水里的危险，挑河泥，冷天脱掉棉鞋下河水，以及第一次去县城里去挑黄粪等，那时我也曾迟疑过，但一鼓起劲，咬咬牙根便克服了。今天的事比起那些来对我好像更为困难，但是面对着这些眼睛我终于决心接受这场考验。当我脱掉鞋袜，挽起裤腿，一双白白的脚终于踏进合粪里去的时候，我才相信我已真正的和农民兄弟站在一起了。
    一瓢一瓢浓得发绿的尿不停地浇到河泥和黄粪上，人们的脚一上一下踩到合粪中，发出“劈拍”的声音。被踩得均匀的合粪，显出黑油油的亮光。这时，站在我旁边的两个年轻的社员，半开玩笑半讲怪话似的要拉我去黄粪最浓的地方去踩。我并不示弱，我既下决心踏进了粪里，难道我还在乎浓或稀吗？但是当我刚要过去踩的时候，我的房东女主人出来说话了：“就在这边行了！”她那泼辣的声音立刻使那两个青年人驯服了。接着，住在我家对面的赵伯伯递过来一把锹给我，要我扶着锹踩，免得被滑倒。他朝着社员们说：“如果个个像老白这样肯干，别说一千二，一千五百斤也能收到！”刚才开玩笑的那两个社员也来关照我，脚往下踩时慢慢地下去，快了容易被瓦碴子砸伤。
    傍晚，粪已经造好。女社员们都拥到溪边洗脚去了，场头只剩下几个男社员在做收尾工作。一个老农问过我“辛苦了！再过些日子，这些合粪晒干后，便可挑去肥田。”这时，我一股劳动后愉快的热潮，便涌进我的心里来了。
    临睡前，有几个社员来探望我。他们笑着问：“是不是用香皂洗了脚？”
    这个晚上，我想着今天的一切。这一关，大概才是我的感情变化的真的开始。
