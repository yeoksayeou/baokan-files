    Small Lead Wire Measuring Tool
    (By our report) The director of the Renyi Office in Leiyang, Hunan, Han Jixiu, and comrades such as Mao Shengqiu have manufactured a "human" shaped hand-held rice transplanter measuring tool. The county party committee has decided to vigorously promote it throughout the county.
    The "human" shaped hand-held rice transplanter measuring tool has a very simple structure. It only requires a fine lead wire one foot five inches long. By winding the lead wire, it can be formed into a "human" shape. The middle is turned into a circle, the size of the circle depending on the size of the person's right index finger. One end is the row spacing, and the other end is the plant spacing.

    “人”字形随手插秧衡量器，构造非常简单，只要一尺五寸长的细铅丝，把铅丝绕转来，跨成“人”字形，中间转成一个圈，圈的大、小看人的右手食指大、小而定，一头是行距，一头是株距。
