Spring Production Agricultural Proverbs
	Plant one grain of millet in spring, and harvest ten thousand loads of grain in autumn.
	Grain starts with seedlings, good seedlings are half of spring.
                   (Sichuan)
	Planting late due to the season, crops will fool people. Good rice needs good seedlings, and then the barn will be full of yellow grain.
                   (Yunnan)
	Around "Qingming," plant melons and sow beans. Plow a piece of land in the spring, and harvest a shi of grain in the autumn.
                    (Shandong, etc.)
	Better to suffer spring frost than autumn frost.
                     (Jilin)

    春季生产农谚春种一粒粟，秋收万担谷。谷从秧上起，秧好一半春。
                   （四川）季节迟下种，庄稼把人哄。好稻好秧，黄谷满仓。
                   （云南）“清明”前后，种瓜点豆。春天刨一片，秋天收一石。
                    （山东等地）宁受春冻，不挨秋霜。
                     （吉林）
