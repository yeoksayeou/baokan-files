    Resolutely Carry Out a Soil Revolution
    Hubei, Guizhou and Other Places Turn Several Million Mu of Barren Land into Fertile Fields
    (Our report) While focusing on completing water conservancy projects and increasing fertilizer accumulation, rural areas across Hubei Province have also vigorously carried out soil improvement work. According to incomplete statistics, as of mid-February, the province has already used various soil improvement methods to transform more than 3.2 million mu of low-yield, poor-quality land. Assuming an increase of 150 jin of grain per mu, this alone would enable the province to increase grain production by about 500 million jin. According to investigations by relevant departments in Hubei Province, there are still approximately 10 million mu of such backward land in the province, which is expected to be completely transformed within three years.
    According to local experience, mobilizing the masses to improve soil on a large scale also requires careful accounting and organizing on-site visits. Taoyuanfan in Macheng County has more than 300 mu of barren sandbars, which in the past produced only 40-50 jin of wheat and seed cotton per mu. After soil improvement was carried out on this area in the winter of 1956, wheat reached a yield of 240 jin per mu in 1957, and seed cotton reached 152 jin per mu. After the Macheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a site meeting on soil improvement in Taoyuanfan in December last year for representatives of more than 70 agricultural cooperatives, soil improvement work was launched throughout the county. By the end of January, more than 77,000 mu of backward land in Macheng County had completed soil improvement.
    The soil improvement methods used in various places are tailored to local conditions and different methods are adopted according to different soil types. For example, sandy soil is added to sticky, rotten mud fields, and soil is added to those with too much sand. The transformation of low-lying swampy areas mainly involves building dikes for reclamation, creating high compartments, and digging deep ditches. Cold paddy fields in mountainous areas are improved by opening ditches along the mountains and spring water to drain cold spring water, as well as deep plowing and fertilization.
    (Our report) Since November of last year, the Bijie Special District of Guizhou Province, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountain, has adopted a variety of methods such as soil exchange, sending fertile mud to lean fields, and lime neutralization, to carry out a large-scale soil improvement movement. As of February 26, 731,273 mu of lean and thin fields and acidic soils in the district have been improved, accounting for 50% of the original plan of 1.47 million mu, an increase of 146% over the same period of the previous year. After the plan is fully completed, grain production can be increased by 15 million jin.
    Before the soil improvement movement was launched, various parts of the Bijie Special District generally made comparative summaries of past soil improvement situations, so that the broad masses of cadres and people saw the bright prospects for the development of mountain production, thus greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses for soil improvement and finding ways to improve the quality of soil improvement work. The amount of fertile mud used per mu of land improved by the guest soil method has doubled compared with the past, with 50% applying 40,000 jin. Last year, Weining National United Cooperative used 15,000 jin of fertile mud to improve one mu of land, harvesting 150 jin of corn, an increase of 18%; another cooperative used 45,000 jin of fertile mud to improve one mu of land, harvesting 214 jin of corn, an increase of 43.7%. Under such a comparison of facts, the National United Cooperative laid 130,000 jin of black gray-wrapped soil per mu in the 21 mu of clay soil that has been improved this year, and promptly carried out plowing and mixing. Under the guidance of the county agricultural technology promotion station, the Bijie Heping Cooperative Forest Team used more than 30,000 jin of fertile mud per mu to improve 60 mu of open space; for fields planted with small seasonal crops, soil improvement was carried out by applying fertile mud in holes and strips. In the entire special district, soil improved by applying fertile mud in holes, strips, and scattering accounts for about 30%, greatly improving the quality of soil improvement.
    The Bijie Special District includes nine counties including Jinsha, Dading, and Qianxi. The altitude of general areas is about 2,000 meters above sea level, and the soil of most cultivated land is relatively barren. During the first five-year plan period, farmers of all ethnic groups used fertile mud and lime to improve the soil, achieving remarkable results. According to investigations by agricultural leading departments, all fields that have been improved by soil improvement can increase production by one to two times under normal circumstances.

    坚决进行土壤革命
    湖北贵州等地把几百万亩瘠薄土地变成了良田
    本报讯　湖北省各地农村在突击完成水利工程和增积肥料同时，还大力开展了改良土壤的工作。据不完全统计，到2月中旬止，全省已经用各种改良土壤办法，改造了产量低、土质差的落后田地三百二十多万亩。每亩以增产粮食一百五十斤计，仅这一项，全省便可增产粮食五亿斤左右。据湖北省有关部门调查，全省这类落后田地大约还有一千万亩左右，预计三年内可全部改造完毕。
    根据各地经验，发动群众大规模改良土壤，也是要算细账，组织现场参观。麻城县桃园畈有三百多亩荒沙洲，过去亩产小麦、籽棉都只不过四、五十斤。1956年冬对这块地方进行土壤改良后，1957年小麦达到亩产二百四十斤；籽棉亩产一百五十二斤。中共麻城县委去年12月召集七十多个农业社的代表在桃园畈举行改良土壤现场会以后，改良土壤工作即在全县开展起来。到元月底止，麻城县有七万七千多亩落后田地完成了土壤改良。
    各地改良土壤的方法是，因地制宜，根据不同土质采用不同办法。如土质粘的烂泥田就掺沙，含沙多的就掺土；对低洼沼泽地的改造，主要是筑堤围垦，作高厢；开深沟；山区冷浸田，则沿山、沿泉水开沟排出冷泉水，并深耕加肥。
    本报讯　从去年11月份以来，贵州毕节专区以愚公移山的精神，采用土壤对调、送肥泥到瘦田、石灰中和等多种多样的办法，开展了一个规模巨大的土壤改良运动。至2月26日止，全区经过改良的瘦、薄田地和酸性土壤已有七十三万一千二百七十三亩，占原计划一百四十七万亩的50％，比前一年同时期增加146％；计划全部完成后，可增产粮食一千五百万斤。
    当改良土壤运动展开以前，毕节专区各地一般都把过去改良土壤的情况作了对比总结，使广大干部、群众看到了山区生产发展的美好远景，因而大大激发了干部和群众改良土壤的积极性，并想方设法提高改良土壤的工作质量。用客土法改良的田土，每亩用肥泥的数量比过去提高一倍，施放四万斤的达50％。威宁民族联合社去年用一万五千斤肥泥改良一亩地，收玉米一百五十斤，增产18％；另一社用四万五千斤肥泥改良一亩地，收玉米二百一十四斤，增产43.7％。在这种事实对比下，民族联合社就在今年已改的二十一亩粘土里，每亩铺放了十三万斤黑色灰包土，并及时加以耕犁拌合。毕节和平社森林队在县农业技术推广站的指导下，每亩用三万多斤肥泥，改良了六十亩空地；对栽有小季作物的田土，则采用穴施、条施肥泥的办法进行土壤改良。全专区穴施、条施、撒施肥泥改良的土壤占30％左右，大大提高了改良土壤的质量。
    毕节专区包括金沙、大定、黔西等九个县，一般地区的高度都是拔海两千公尺左右，大部耕地的土壤都较贫瘠。在第一个五年计划期间，各族农民用肥泥和石灰等改良土壤，取得了显著成绩。据农业领导部门调查，凡经过土壤改良的田土，在正常情况下都能增产一倍到两倍。
