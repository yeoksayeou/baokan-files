    Why does the bell ring incessantly on this Sunday?
    Gather at exactly seven o'clock, to plant trees outside the village.
    Carrying hoes and iron shovels,
    Carrying bundles of saplings,
    Carrying water bottles and dry rations,
    And carrying fiery hearts.
    Teachers lead the students,
    Marching towards nature,
    The red school flag flutters,
    The battle proceeds intensely.
    As the sun sets,
    The afforestation task is complete,
    The young soldiers return home,
    Each and every one happy.
    An eagle leaves early in the morning,
    Returning at dusk to a startled sight:
    How did this barren sandy land transform into a Young Pioneer Forest?

    红领巾林
    屠岸今天是星期天，为什么钟声不停？正七点钟集合，到村外去造林。带着镢头铁锨，带着一捆捆树秧，带着水壶和干粮，还带着火热的心。老师领着学生，向大自然进军，红色校旗飘扬，战斗紧张地进行。夕阳西下时分，造林任务完成，小战士们回家去，一个个高高兴兴。老鹰清早出门，傍晚归来吃一惊：这片荒沙土地怎变了红领巾林？
