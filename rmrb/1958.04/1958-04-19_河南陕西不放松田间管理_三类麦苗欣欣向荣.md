Henan and Shaanxi Do Not Relax Field Management
Three Types of Wheat Seedlings are Thriving
(Our report) The more than 70 million mu of wheat in Henan Province are growing well, and the field management campaign carried out in various places has achieved great results. Now, the boundless wheat seedlings are jointing and heading, with thick stems and leaves, and the wheat seedlings are growing particularly vigorously. Since late March, Henan Province, led by the secretary and with all the members dispatched, has led the masses to advance towards the three types of wheat seedlings.

In order to improve the growth of the third type of wheat in Anyang County, the masses sent 190,000 people and more than 8,000 carts to deliver manure and topdressing fertilizer to the third type of wheat fields. In order to concentrate its efforts on improving the third type of wheat fields, Wuzhi County decided to postpone the commencement of medium-sized water conservancy projects, and all primary schools in the county were given a three-day holiday to go all out. Boai County decided to apply an additional 10,000 jin of coarse fertilizer to the second type of wheat on the basis of 25,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and in addition to 10,000 jin of coarse fertilizer to the third type of wheat, also apply 20 to 30 jin of chemical fertilizer. Various regions have also established wheat field management teams to implement fixed personnel, fixed tasks, fixed time, and fixed quality for the third type of wheat fields, and conduct regular inspections and evaluations. Through a week of intensive efforts in Xinyang Prefecture, 450,000 mu of third-class wheat seedlings have been transformed into second-class wheat seedlings, and 880,000 mu of second-class wheat seedlings have been transformed into first-class wheat seedlings. Now, management is being further strengthened to strive for a bumper harvest. (Zhang Lizhong)

(Our report) Wheat in Shaanxi Province is growing vigorously. According to estimates by the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, if there are no major natural disasters, the original production plan can be overfulfilled. Including spring wheat, Shaanxi Province has planted more than 24 million mu of wheat this year.

In the work of wheat field management, all localities have universally put forward the slogan of "wheat harvesting does not start, processing does not stop." All localities have generally classified, ranked, and managed wheat fields. After adopting the method of contracting down to the grassroots level, adding rolling, harrowing, and hoeing, universally watering and focusing on watering urine, and working hard for a month, by early April, more than 3 million mu of the third type of wheat fields in the province have caught up with the second type or the first type.

    河南陕西不放松田间管理
    三类麦苗欣欣向荣
    本报讯　河南省七千多万亩小麦生长良好，各地开展的麦田管理突击活动成绩很大。现在一望无际的麦苗正拔节孕穗，秆粗叶厚，麦苗生长特别旺盛。从3月下旬起，河南省由书记挂帅，委员一齐出动，带动广大群众向三类麦苗进军。
    安阳县群众为改进三类小麦的生长状况，曾出动十九万人、八千多辆大车给三类麦田送粪追肥。武陟县为了集中力量提高三类麦田，决定中型水利工程延期开工，全县小学放假三天，全力以赴。博爱县确定在每亩施肥两万五千斤的基础上，二类麦再上粗肥一万斤，三类麦除上一万斤粗肥外，还上二十至三十斤化学肥料。各地区还成立麦田管理专业队，对三类麦田实行定人、定任务、定时间、定质量，按期检查评比。信阳专区通过一个突击周，三类麦苗变为二类麦苗的四十五万亩，二类麦苗变为一类麦苗的八十八万亩。现在正进一步加强管理，争取大丰收。（张励中）
    本报讯　陕西省的小麦生长茁壮。据陕西省农业厅估计：如无特大自然灾害，可以超额完成原订的生产计划。连春小麦在内，陕西省今年共种了二千四百多万亩小麦。
    在麦田管理工作中，各地普遍提出“麦收不开始，加工不停止”的口号。各地一般都对麦田进行了分类排队，分类管理。全省的三类麦田，经过采用层层包干到底，加碾、加耱、加锄，普遍浇水、重点浇尿，苦战一个月以后，到4月上旬已经有三百多万亩赶上二类或一类。　（刘　斌）
