China's salt industry

Salt is a necessary living material for people, and also an indispensable means of production for the chemical industry, national defense industry, agriculture and fishery. China is rich in salt resources. Along the coastline from the mouth of the Yalu River in the north to Hainan Island in the south, which is more than 11,000 miles long, salt can be produced by solar evaporation everywhere. China now has 47 large and small salt fields, 1,470 salt production cooperatives, and 560,000 salt workers and salt farmers.

China's main sea salt areas are in Liaoning, Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other places, and the sea salt production in these areas accounts for 84% of the country's total output; in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other places, there are many salt lakes. The salt reserves in the main areas of Chaka, Keke, and Cahan in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai alone are more than 30 billion tons, enough for 600 million people to eat for more than 8,000 years. The well salt fields in Zigong, Sichuan are also world-famous. There are brine wells, fire wells, and water-fire wells there, and in some places, natural gas can be used to boil natural brine for salt production. There are also rock salt deposits in Hubei, Hunan, Tibet, Qinghai, Xinjiang and other places. The rock salt reserves in Mangya, Qinghai are also more than 20 billion tons, all of which are naturally crystallized, of pure quality, and can be eaten without processing.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, China produced a total of 29.2 million tons of crude salt, exceeding the original plan by 0.14%. The by-products potassium chloride, bromine, halite anhydrous mirabilite, etc. have also been greatly developed. In addition, new products such as borax, iodine and lithium carbonate have also been produced. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the production of civil salt was the main focus. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, the industrial salt will increase to more than 5 million tons, and gradually shift to industrial salt as the main focus.

The broad masses of salt workers have come up with many ways to increase production and improve product quality. In the past, in the north, sea salt was only produced for four months a year, and in the south, it was only produced for five or six months. Now it is possible to achieve year-round production. Due to year-round production, 1.3 million tons more sea salt was produced in 1957 than in 1952. Various salt fields have also promoted the experience of Huaibei Salt Field in year-round maintenance, seasonal maintenance, major repairs during slack seasons, and minor repairs during busy seasons. The average output per unit area has increased by 35%. Some places have experimented with the use of sun-dried green salt, which can turn yellow-white brine into dark color, greatly increasing the seawater's absorption of solar heat energy, and can also increase production.

At present, meteorological stations have also been established in the key sea salt fields across the country, which can timely and accurately understand the weather conditions of the salt fields, so as to facilitate production guidance.

    我国的制盐工业
    盐是人们必需的生活资料，也是化学工业、国防工业、农业和渔业不可缺少的生产资料。我国盐的资源很丰富。北从鸭绿江口起南到海南岛长一万一千多里的海岸线上，到处都可以晒盐。我国现在有四十七个大小盐场，一千四百七十个盐业生产合作社，有盐工和盐民五十六万。
    我国的主要海盐区有辽宁、河北、天津、山东、江苏、浙江、福建、广东等地，这些地区的海盐产量占全国总产量的84％；在青海、内蒙、山西、陕西等地，还有很多盐湖，单单青海柴达木盆地的茶卡、柯柯、擦尔汗等几个主要地区，盐的蕴藏量就有三百多亿吨，足够六亿人吃八千多年。四川自贡的井盐场，也是世界上有名的。那里有卤井、火井、水火井，有的地方可以用天然气煮天然卤制盐。在湖北、湖南、西藏、青海、新疆等地还有矿盐。青海芒崖的矿盐的藏量也有二百亿吨以上，都是天然结晶，质量很纯，不加工就可以食用。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我国共生产原盐二千九百二十万吨，超过原计划0.14％。副产品氯化钾、溴素、卤块无水芒硝等也有很大发展。此外，还生产了新产品硼砂、碘和碳酸锂等。在第一个五年计划期间是以生产民用盐为主，第二个五年计划期间，工业用盐将增加到五百多万吨，逐步做到以工业用盐为主。
    广大盐工们在增加产量和提高产品质量上想了很多办法。过去在北方，一年只生产海盐四个月，南方只生产五、六个月，现在已经能做到常年生产。由于常年生产，1957年比1952年增产了一百三十万吨海盐。各个盐场还推广了淮北盐场常年维修、四季保养、闲时大修、忙时小修的经验，一般的单位面积产量都增加了35％。有些地方试验使用晒化绿晒盐，晒化绿可以把黄白色的卤水变深，大大增加海水吸收太阳的热能，也可以增产。
    现在，在全国重点海盐场还建立了气象站，可以及时、正确地知道盐场的气象，便于指导生产。
