Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 25th: Guizhou's mountainous areas' 6.45 million mu of rapeseed are beginning to be harvested. This year's rapeseed has many pods and full seeds. According to preliminary calculations, the average yield per mu can reach 60 jin, an increase of one-third compared to last year. The total output can reach more than 380 million jin, more than double last year's, making it the year with the largest increase in rapeseed production in Guizhou Province's history.

This year's bumper rapeseed harvest is the result of the hard work of people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou through the winter and spring. Last year, before the autumn harvest was fully completed, various places began rapeseed sowing work. Therefore, the planting area expanded by more than 70% compared to 1957, and the planting technology has also been greatly improved. Various places broke with conventions and began the second weeding before the Spring Festival. Zunyi Prefecture, the main rapeseed-producing area, carried out four weeding and fertilization operations on rapeseed, eliminating some early flowering and early bolting phenomena. By March, various places mobilized the masses in a timely manner to overcome the spring drought. Jinsha County alone had 120,000 people carrying water to irrigate all the rapeseed and wheat in three days and nights.

Guizhou Province is one of China's major rapeseed-producing areas. During the first Five-Year Plan, rapeseed production increased by an average of 21.5% annually. Now, in addition to self-sufficiency, the province can also supply several thousand tons of oil to large cities and industries every year.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th: Hubei Province recently held a provincial on-site rapeseed production conference in Songzi County.

Representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, and six provinces—Jiangsu, Hunan, Gansu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi—participated in this on-site conference.

The large-scale bumper harvest of more than 73,000 mu of rapeseed in Songzi County has become a certainty. According to investigations by relevant departments, the total rapeseed production this year is expected to increase by 2.37 times compared to last year. The average yield per mu of the more than 33,000 mu of "Victory" rapeseed is expected to reach about 270 jin, and the rapeseed yield in some high-yield fields can reach about 500 jin per mu.

Songzi County is a grain and cotton-producing area on the Jianghan Plain. Since the winter sowing began last year, the local area has reversed the tendency to only pay attention to grain and cotton while neglecting the development of oil crops. A system of dedicated personnel responsible for oil crops was established at all levels from the county to the district, township, cooperative, and team, to uniformly plan and comprehensively arrange the production of various winter crops. All 800+ agricultural cooperatives in the county organized rapeseed professional research groups to promptly propose yield-increasing measures for each production link. Leading cadres at all levels also established more than 7,000 mu of "Victory" rapeseed experimental fields to provide precedents for the large-scale promotion of these yield-increasing measures. They conscientiously implemented various scientific and technological measures, the main one being the active promotion of the improved variety—the "Victory" rapeseed seed. According to statistics, the area sown with "Victory" rapeseed in the county this year has expanded by more than 12,000 mu compared to last year. More than 20 agricultural cooperatives have almost entirely adopted "Victory" rapeseed seeds, and the average yield per mu of this improved variety can be 1.5 times higher than that of local rapeseed varieties. Many cooperatives also promoted the method of raising rapeseed seedlings for transplanting to solve the seasonal conflict between two crops of grain and oil or cotton and oil.

The representatives from various places who participated in the on-site meeting were encouraged by the advanced experience of Songzi County and expressed their willingness to vigorously develop rapeseed production.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th: Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of rapeseed this year. The average yield per mu and the yield of high-yield fields have both surpassed Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, which achieved a large-scale bumper harvest last year.

Currently, the early-maturing rapeseed in Nanzheng County has already begun to be harvested; a large number of healthy and strong rapeseed are also beginning to mature, and farmers are actively preparing for the harvest. According to the comprehensive assessment of the oilseed bumper harvest observation meeting recently held in the county by representatives from 39 counties and cities in the province's rapeseed-producing areas, it is estimated that the 46,000 mu of rapeseed in Nanzheng County can produce an average of more than 200 jin of rapeseed per mu, an increase of more than 80% compared to last year. The high-yield rapeseed fields planted by the county farm and the Wufeng Township agricultural cooperative can reach an average of 350 jin to 470 jin per mu, respectively.

    油菜增产捷报频传
    贵州总产量将超过去年一倍多
    松滋、南郑高额丰产赶上兴化
    新华社贵阳25日电　贵州山区六百四十五万亩油菜开始收割。今年油菜结荚多，菜籽饱满，据初步计算，平均每亩可以收获菜籽六十斤，比去年提高三分之一；总产量可以达到三亿八千多万斤，超过去年一倍多，成为贵州省历史上菜籽增产最多的一年。
    今年油菜大丰收，是贵州各族农民苦战一冬、大干一春的结果。去年秋收还没有全部结束，各地就开展了油菜播种工作。因此，播种面积比1957年扩大了70％以上，播种技术也大有改进。各地打破陈规，在春节前就开始了第二次锄草。油菜籽主要产区遵义专区共对油菜进行了四次锄草、施肥，消灭了部分油菜早花早苔现象。到3月份，各地又及时动员群众战胜春旱，仅金沙县就有十二万群众在三天三夜内把所有油菜和小麦抬水淋了一次。
    贵州省是我国油菜籽主要产区之一，在第一个五年计划期间菜籽产量每年平均增长21.5％。现在，全省油料除自给外，每年还可以有几千吨供应大城市和工业的需要。
    新华社武汉28日电　湖北省最近在松滋县召开了全省油菜生产现场会议。
    农业部、粮食部和江苏、湖南、甘肃、安徽、江西、陕西六省都有代表参加这次现场会议。
    松滋县七万三千多亩油菜大面积丰产已成定局。经有关部门调查，预计今年油菜籽总产量可以比去年增加二点三七倍，三万三千多亩胜利种油菜平均每亩产量预计可以达到二百七十斤左右，有些丰产田的油菜每亩产量可以达到五百斤左右。
    松滋县是江汉平原上的一个粮、棉产区。去年冬播开始，当地扭转了只重视粮、棉不注意发展油料的偏向，从县到区、乡、社、队，层层建立油料专人负责制，统一规划和全面安排各种冬季作物的生产。全县八百多个农业社，社社组织了油菜专业研究小组，及时提出各个生产环节的增产措施。各级领导干部并建立七千多亩胜利油菜试验田，为大面积推广这些增产措施提供先例。他们认真地贯彻执行了各项科学技术措施，其中主要一条是积极推广良种——胜利油菜种。据统计，全县今年播种胜利油菜的面积比去年扩大了一万二千多亩，有二十多个农业社几乎全部采用胜利油菜种，这种良种平均每亩产量可以比本地油菜种提高一倍半。许多社并推行油菜育苗移栽法，以解决粮、油和棉、油两熟的季节性矛盾。
    参加现场会议的各地代表，受到松滋县先进经验的鼓舞，纷纷表示要大力发展油菜生产。
    新华社西安28日电　陕西南郑县今年油菜获得大面积丰收，每亩平均产量和高额丰产田的产量都超过去年大面积丰产的江苏兴化县。
    现在，南郑县早熟的油菜有的已经开始收割；大批生长健旺的油菜也开始成熟，农民们正在积极准备收割。根据全省油菜产区三十九个县市代表最近在这个县召开油菜丰产观摩会的全面鉴定，预计南郑县四万六千亩油菜，每亩平均可以产菜籽二百斤以上，比去年增产80％多。县农场和梧凤乡农业社种植的高额丰产田油菜，平均每亩分别可以达到三百五十斤到四百七十斤。
