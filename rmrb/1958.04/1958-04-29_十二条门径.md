　　Twelve Gateways
　　How to solve the difficulty of labor shortage in the great leap forward of industrial production? Yangquan City has initially explored a set of methods. They adopted twelve measures to unearth 10,000 laborers, basically solving the problem of labor shortage. First, adjust labor organization, implement mixed work and comprehensive coal mining teams. Second, promote one person learning multiple skills, everyone learning all-around skills, and two people doing the work of three. Third, organize labor allocation and cooperation between enterprises. Fourth, promote technological reform to replace manual labor with machinery. Fifth, streamline non-production personnel. Sixth, improve attendance rate and streamline non-quota personnel. Seventh, organize scattered urban labor and residents to participate in production. Eighth, include the work-study program of secondary schools in the calculation. Ninth, use older workers to replace younger workers, female workers to replace male workers, and make reasonable use of labor. Tenth, organize family members to participate in labor. Eleventh, use prisoners who may participate in labor. Twelfth, consider implementing the "Great Sabbath" advocated by basic construction workers. The Shanxi Daily reported this news on the 26th, published an editorial entitled "Let All Urban Residents Work," and included an illustration.

    十二条门径
    在工业生产大跃进中，如何解决劳力不足的困难？阳泉市初步摸索到一套办法。他们采取了十二项措施，挖出了一万个劳动力，基本上解决了劳力不足的困难。一、调整劳动组织，实行混合工作、综合采煤队。二、提倡一人学会多种技术，人人学成全把式，二人做三人的活。三、组织各企业之间的劳力调配协作。四、推行技术改革，以机械代人工。五、精简非生产人员。六、提高出勤率，精简非定额人员。七、组织城市分散劳力和居民参加生产。八、把中等学校勤工俭学计划也算在内。九、老换少、女换男，合理使用劳力。十、组织家属参加劳动。十一、利用可能参加劳动的犯人参加。十二、可考虑实行基本建设工人倡议的大礼拜。26日的山西日报报道了这消息，发表了“让城市居民人人劳动”的社论，并配了个插图。
