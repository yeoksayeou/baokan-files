    How to Plant a Tree and Make it Live
    In order to ensure the survival of newly planted trees, several things must be done well in the afforestation process:
    First, protect the seedlings. From the time the saplings are dug up from the nursery until they are planted, they must be properly protected, especially the roots, which should not be exposed to the sun. This is because the vigorously growing young roots lack waterproof tissue, and many trees have countless root hairs, which are very susceptible to withering. If using direct seeding for afforestation, be sure to collect mature, plump seeds and store and protect them properly after harvesting.
    Second, prepare the land. Before planting trees, the soil should be loosened to make it easier to accumulate rainwater, and the soil should be loose so that the nutrients in the soil are in a state that is easily absorbed by the trees. For afforestation on dry and barren mountains, horizontal ditches or fish-scale pits can be used to prepare the land in order to accumulate rainwater. As for planting trees in urban areas and factory areas, construction waste residues (such as lime slag, cement slag, and broken iron pieces) should be removed and replaced with good soil before planting trees.
    Third, the roots should be spread out, the depth should be appropriate, the saplings should be straight, and the soil should be firm. When planting trees, the roots of the saplings should be spread out, and they should not be curled or bent. The planting pit should be dug to an appropriate depth, generally the same depth as the sapling was originally planted in the soil. In dry land, it can be dug deeper. The saplings should be planted straight. After planting, the soil must be compacted so that the roots of the saplings are closely combined with the new soil, without any air pockets. Most deciduous saplings can be coppiced after planting (that is, the saplings are cut off at ground level to allow them to re-sprout and grow), which makes it easier for the trees to survive and grow quickly and well.
    Fourth, newly planted trees should be well protected and nurtured. In urban areas and around houses, attention should be paid to preventing damage from pedestrians and livestock. In mountainous afforestation, weeding and soil loosening should be carried out in a timely manner during the young forest stage, generally two to four times a year, until the young trees provide shade. The first soil loosening and weeding should be done earlier, and the last one can be done after the end of the rainy season. In the hot summer, be careful when loosening the soil and weeding, and avoid damaging the roots of the seedlings to avoid affecting their water absorption capacity. At the same time, pay attention to not suddenly exposing the seedlings to strong sunlight after weeding to avoid scorching and withering.
    Fifth, pay attention to soil and water conservation. After afforestation of barren mountains, it can play a role in soil and water conservation. However, in the early stage of afforestation, newly planted trees cannot play a role in soil and water conservation for a while, and soil erosion is easily caused after the soil layer is loosened after land preparation on mountains. Especially when planting fruit trees, tea trees, and special economic forests on mountains, the spacing between plants and rows is sparse, which can easily cause erosion. The way to prevent soil erosion is to avoid comprehensive land preparation on steep slopes; build slope protection projects in areas prone to collapse; and do a good job of drainage ditches in areas where water flow is concentrated. Land preparation with horizontal ditches or fish-scale pits has a significant effect on accumulating rainwater and conserving soil and water, but receiving too much rainwater can easily cause erosion. The prevention method is first of all that horizontal ditches and fish-scale pits must be built firmly. Secondly, after heavy rain, timely inspection should be carried out, and if erosion is found, it should be repaired immediately to avoid development. (Tian Zhonglun)

    怎样才能把树栽活
    为了把树栽活，在造林过程中必须做好几件事：
    第一，保护好种苗。苗木从苗圃挖起到种好为止，在这个过程中必须妥善保护，特别是苗木的根部，不可曝晒。因为生长旺盛的幼根的皮部缺乏防水组织，许多树木更有无数根毛，它们都很容易枯萎。如果用种子直播造林，一定要采集成熟、饱满的种子，采下后要妥善贮藏和保护。
    第二，准备好土地。种树以前要把土挖松，使它容易积蓄雨水，土质疏松，使土壤中的养料成为树木容易吸收的状态。在干旱荒山造林，为了积蓄雨水，可以用水平沟、鱼鳞坑的整地法。至于在城市、工厂区种树，还要把建筑弃废的残渣（如石灰屑、水泥渣、碎铁片等）除去换上好土以后再种树。
    第三，苗根伸展，深浅合宜，苗要直，土要实。种树要使树苗根系伸展，不可使它卷曲和弯折。种树的坑要挖到适当深度，一般以苗木原来入土深度为宜，在干旱地可以深挖一些。树苗要栽得直。栽后必须把土踏紧，使苗木的根与新土密切结合，不可透空。多数落叶树小苗栽好以后可以平茬（就是将苗木齐地剪去，使重新萌芽生长），这样树容易成活，长得又快又好。
    第四，新种的树木要很好保护和抚育。城市和四旁植树要注意防止行人和牲畜的损伤。山地造林在幼林阶段要及时进行中耕除草，一般每年两次到四次，到幼树成荫为止。第一次中耕除草应该早些，最后一次可以在雨季结束以后进行。在炎热的夏天，中耕除草要小心，要避免损伤苗根，以免影响吸水能力，同时还要注意除草后不使苗木骤然暴露于强烈日光之下而灼伤枯萎。
    第五，注意水土保持。荒山绿化以后可以起到水土保持作用。但在造林初期，新种的树木一时还不能起到水土保持作用，而山地经过整地，土层翻松后容易造成水土流失。特别是在山地种植果树、茶树和特种经济林木，株行距稀疏，很容易造成冲刷。防止水土冲刷的办法，是在陡坡避免全面整地；容易坍塌的地方修筑护坡工程，水流集中的地方，做好排水道。用水平沟或者鱼鳞坑整地的，对积蓄、雨水和水土保持有显著作用，但是接收雨水多，也就容易引起冲刷。防止的办法首先是水平沟和鱼鳞坑一定要修得坚实。其次，在大雨后应该及时检查，发现冲垮现象，立即修补，避免发展。　（田仲伦）
