    Historical Storm on the North China Plain
    —Reading Liang Bin’s “Red Flag Spectrum”
    Yi Mo
    Since last October, several novels have been published successively, such as "Tracks in the Snowy Forest", "Song of Youth", "Red Flag Spectrum", and "Bitter Herbs", which have been warmly welcomed by the majority of readers. Right-wing elements attack our lack of achievements in creation, and these works are one of the good answers.
    From my personal preference, I prefer "Red Flag Spectrum." Because it depicts the earliest—around the Great Revolution of 1927—magnificent picture of the revolutionary storm on such a broad historical background.
    There is a passage in "Red Flag Spectrum" that describes a young peasant, Yan Yuntao, who likes to read "Water Margin" very much, and attracts many young people to listen to his stories of Water Margin. This detail also made me associate "Red Flag Spectrum" with the history of the Chinese people's revolution. As everyone knows, in addition to hundreds of peasant uprisings and peasant revolutions, large and small, like Water Margin over thousands of years, the uprisings and revolutions that have followed one another in the past century alone have filled the history books. However, the path that truly changed the face of feudal history through revolution, and finally completely eliminated the ruling class that hindered historical progress, only began with the Chinese Communist Party raising the red flag that cheered the people. How much blood did the Chinese people pay to explore this revolutionary path! However, in the history of new literature, there is still no rich "record" of this initial historical storm. It is in this sense that we warmly welcome "Red Flag Spectrum" and eagerly await the author of "Red Flag Spectrum" to complete his magnificent epic plan of writing six "Red Flag Spectrums."
    In terms of content, the first part of "Red Flag Spectrum" describes the struggle between peasants and landlords on the banks of the Hutuo River and the Zulong River, highlighting the development of the revolution in the central Hebei region after the "April 12th" incident—the vigorous "Anti-Head Tax Movement" and the shocking "Second Normal School Student Movement," unfolding a broad picture of rural struggle and mass struggle before the readers.
    The novel begins with the struggle between two families, three generations of peasants, and one family of landlords. This generational blood feud was ignited by a specific event—the landlord Feng Lanchi selling an ancient bell and seizing forty-eight acres of government land. Zhu Laogong, this enthusiastic and righteous peasant, and his good friend Yan Laoxiang, exposed Feng Lanchi's conspiracy in front of the people of the forty-eight villages, but this struggle finally failed due to their weakness and isolation. Zhu Laogong also died of anger and spitting blood because of this. The cruel landlord Feng Lanchi was unwilling to give up. He sent thugs to rape Zhu Laogong's daughter, and forced Zhu Laogong's son Zhu Huzi and Yan Laoxiang to leave. However, the struggle did not end there. This generational blood feud is forever fresh in the memory of the people of the forty-eight villages. They tell and sing about Zhu Laogong's heroic deeds. Zhu Laozhong (Zhu Huzi), who wandered in Northeast China, although struggling hard outside for twenty-five years, did not forget Suojing Town and the blood feud of killing his father: "Whenever I think of my hometown! My heart aches!" He finally returned with his two sons, adding a "thorn in the side" to Feng Laolan. Moreover, Yan Zhihe and Zhu Laoming, descendants of Yan Laoxiang and peers of Zhu Laozhong, had united twenty-eight poor people to sue Feng Laolan. Although the lawsuit was lost in the county, the province, and the Supreme Court, it left a deep impression on the people of the forty-eight villages. People can't forget this "new and old hatred of several generations."
    However, whether it is the older generation of Zhu Laogong and Yan Laoxiang, or the second generation of Zhu Laozhong, Yan Zhihe, and Zhu Laoming, although they all have the unyielding fighting character of generations of peasants, they have not found a proper way to struggle, and basically still use personal resistance to fight against the strong feudal forces. In terms of the way of struggle, they cannot break through the scope of feudal forces. Therefore, they can only be defeated repeatedly and have no ability to change their oppressed class status. This is the historical tragedy of peasant struggles in feudal society.
    However, the torrent of history finally showed a new direction. The proletarian party—the Communist Party—has penetrated into the countryside, which has completely changed the face of the struggle between peasants and landlords. The new generation—Yan Zhihe's sons Yuntao and Jiangtao—who were educated by the Communist Party, although inheriting the courageous fighting character of their fathers and grandfathers, embarked on a new revolutionary road. Under the leadership of the Party, the combination of the older generation's righteous revenge character and the new generation's Communist Party members' qualities prepared a strong force for the revolution. The vigorous "Anti-Head Tax Movement" was launched on this basis. This was the first time that the feudal rule of the Feng family compound among the people of the forty-eight villages was resolutely repelled by the peasants. And the third generation of Feng Laolan's nemesis—Yan Jiangtao and Zhu Dagui—became the leaders and backbones of this movement. In the famous Second Normal School Student Movement, it was precisely these young peasant children educated by the Party who showed the heroic spirit of resolute struggle to the death.
    While reflecting these vigorous struggles, the author meticulously depicts the lives of peasants who suffered cruel exploitation and oppression in those painful historical years, and carves out the different fighting characters and revolutionary characters of the older generation of peasants and the new generation like a relief. The character characteristics of the older generation of figures such as Zhu Laozhong, Yan Zhihe, Zhu Laoming, and Wu Laoba are certainly not the same, and even the new generation of figures such as Yuntao, Jiangtao, Zhang Jiaqing, Dagui, Ergui, Chunlan, and Yan Ping all have their own different character traits.
    What we can see now is only the content of the first part of "Red Flag Spectrum." The characters of the young heroes in "Red Flag Spectrum" are still developing. Therefore, here, we first select two prominent characters of the older generation—Zhu Laozhong and Yan Zhihe—to talk about.
    At a symposium of the "Literary Gazette" (Note), the author recalled the process of initially writing Zhu Laozhong and said: "... The motivation for creation came from such a moving event: after two revolutionary comrades were killed by the enemy, his father came to the central Hebei district to find the district party committee to find out how his son died. At that time, I saw that the old man looked very optimistic and was physically strong, talking and laughing. He didn't look like a person who had lost two sons. I also talked to the old man and was very moved. At this time, the image of Zhu Laozhong began to form in my mind."
    The author initially wrote a short story "The Father of Three Bolsheviks" for this old man, and later developed it into a novella, and finally wrote him into "Red Flag Spectrum."
    Although the author's narrative of the creative process of this character is brief, it is worthy of our deep thought. I believe that anyone who has read "Red Flag Spectrum" will admit that the character who leaves a deep impression on people in the work is Zhu Laozhong. This shows that the author's three developments of this character have indeed achieved significant artistic effects. The main reason why this character is so real and touching is that the writer's creation of this character can penetrate into the historical realm that forms this character. Zhu Laozhong's strength, decisiveness, courage, and willingness to fight, and Zhu Laozhong's final becoming a Communist Party member, are the inevitable results of his own life path. Zhu Laozhong is a warrior who has grown up through thousands of trials and tribulations from the sea of blood and hatred. The suffering experience, the never-yielding confidence in life that burns for revenge, as long as he enters the furnace of the Party, will immediately condense into strong and tough steel. Zhu Laozhong is the kind of "most valuable character of the Chinese people" that Chairman Mao said. It not only has practical significance but also has profound historical significance. This character summarizes the historical character of the vast number of Chinese peasants with a tradition of struggle.
    Yan Zhihe, whose class origin is similar to Zhu Laozhong but whose life experience is completely different, shows significant differences from Zhu Laozhong in terms of life and character. Although he also hates Feng Laolan and deeply remembers the generational blood feud, he eventually has a "treasure land," a warm home, and two smart and capable sons. Moreover, from the perspective of his life destiny, Yan Zhihe has not experienced the painful baptism of blood like Zhu Laozhong, nor does he have Zhu Laozhong's rich experience of struggling hard with life in Northeast China. He grew up in a small "greenhouse." He has the love of his parents, the care of Tao's mother, and the "treasure land" to ensure his well-off life. This weakens his confidence in fighting against reality, and also affects his keen perception of the struggle life. The author fully depicts this contradiction in Yan Zhihe's character. Yuntao's arrest and the loss of the "treasure land" once strongly hit Yan Zhihe. He fully expects Jiangtao not to repeat his brother's path, but the reactionaries also took Jiangtao from his hands. Yan Zhihe, who has become a Communist Party member, almost committed suicide in the face of this powerful blow. Yan Zhihe, this loyal, diligent, and somewhat weak character, is a living portrayal of millions of bankrupt middle peasants in old China. In the author's pen, both Zhu Laozhong and Yan Zhihe have the author's artistic originality in terms of character shaping and inner life depiction.
    From a general point of view, although "Red Flag Spectrum" has these main advantages, "Red Flag Spectrum" also obviously has some defects in terms of ideology and art, which need to be seriously considered by the author.
    The first part of "Red Flag Spectrum" does not describe the leadership of the Party clearly or prominently enough. In the vigorous anti-head tax movement, it highlights Jiangtao's personal appeal too much, and lacks a full description of the Party's detailed and complex rural work and the Party's collective leadership. There are also many places where it can be seen that the author cannot vividly present the Party's work, but only relies on simple explanations of policy instructions. At that time, the local Party leader—Jia Xiangnong—should also be said to be the most unsuccessful character in "Red Flag Spectrum," like a conceptual shadow. His leadership of rural work gives the impression that he only encountered Yuntao by chance, which touched his inspiration. His leadership methods also have accidental inspirational factors. As a Party leader, we cannot see the Party's vigorous activity ability from him. And what the author spent a lot of effort and enthusiasm to describe is obviously some bookishness remaining on him.
    Even on the most successful characters—Zhu Laozhong and Yan Zhihe—there are still some rough traces left. As a historical character, the image of Zhu Laozhong is very clear. But from a character of individual resistance to a communist, the author lacks a convincing description of the change in his ideology and the realistic basis for his full trust in the Party. Some hasty explanations, such as writing that Zhu Laozhong's trust in the Red Army was due to the influence of the Soviet revolution in Northeast China, are also slightly simplistic. Especially Yan Zhihe's transformation is written too easily. Chunlan, who was written vigorously and vividly in the first half, seems too dim in the back. It seems that Yuntao's arrest completely took away her soul, but did not bring her the courage to fight in life.
    From an artistic point of view, "Red Flag Spectrum" has absorbed the animation-style techniques of classical novels in the physical description of characters, the character depiction, and the use of life language, which has added a lot of vitality to the characters he describes. However, in the construction of the plot, the author has adopted a jumping form, and the division of chapters and sections is too trivial, which seems to affect the prominence and clarity of the characters and plots. All these make it take a lot of effort to connect and associate, which cannot but affect the artistic effect. We hope that all these shortcomings can be fully compensated in the second part of "Red Flag Spectrum" and the second edition of the first part. This will make this epic work more complete.

    冀中平原上的历史风暴
    ——读梁斌的“红旗谱”
    伊默
    去年10月以来，陆续出版了几部长篇小说，如“林海雪原”、“青春之歌”、“红旗谱”、“苦菜花”等，受到广大读者的热烈欢迎。右派分子攻击我们创作上没有成绩，这些作品是很好的回答之一。
    从我个人的爱好来说，我是比较喜欢“红旗谱”的。因为它是在那样广阔的历史背景上，描绘了革命风暴的最初的——1927大革命前后——雄伟的画幅。
    “红旗谱”里有过这样一段描写，写一个年轻的农民——严运涛很喜欢读“水浒”，而且吸引了很多年轻人都爱听他说水浒故事。这个细节也使我从“红旗谱”联想到中国人民革命的历史。谁都知道，除去几千年来像水浒那样的农民起义、农民革命大小数百次以外，仅仅近百年来前仆后继，此起彼伏的起义、革命，就是载满了史册的。然而，真正使革命改变封建历史面貌的途径，最后彻底消灭了阻碍历史前进的统治阶级，却只有从中国共产党举起使万众欢腾的红旗，才算开始了这历史的新序幕。中国人民摸索这条革命的道路，是曾经付出了多少血的代价啊！但是，在新文学史上，这最初的历史风暴，却还没有丰富的“记录”。正是从这种意义上，我们热烈地欢迎“红旗谱”，也热烈地期待“红旗谱”的作者早日完成他的写完六部“红旗谱”的雄伟史诗的计划。
    从内容来看，“红旗谱”的第一部是写了滹沱河与瀦龙河畔农民和地主的斗争，突出地描写了“四一二”以后党在冀中地区的革命发展的形势——轰轰烈烈的“反割头税运动”，震惊人心的“二师学潮斗争”，在读者面前，展开了广阔的农村斗争群众斗争的图景。
    小说是从两家三代农民和一家地主的斗争开始写起的。这世代血仇是从一个具体的事件——地主冯兰池卖古钟，霸占四十八亩官地，点燃起斗争的火把的。朱老巩，这个急公好义的农民，和他的好友严老祥一起，在四十八村人的面前，揭穿了冯兰池的阴谋，但是，这个斗争，终于由于人单势孤，没有斗过冯兰池而失败了。朱老巩也为此窝气吐血而死。凶狠的地主冯兰池，却还不肯干休，他派遣狗腿子强奸了朱老巩的女儿，逼走了朱老巩的儿子朱虎子和严老祥。斗争却也并没有因此而结束，这世代的血仇，在四十八村人民中间，永远是记忆犹新的，他们传说着歌唱着朱老巩的英雄行为。流浪在关东的朱老忠（朱虎子），虽然在外面困苦挣扎了二十五年，也并没有忘记锁井镇，没有忘记杀父的血仇：“一想起家乡啊！心上就一剜一剜的疼！”他终于带着两个儿子回来了，给冯老兰添上了一根“眼中钉”。而且严老祥的后代、朱老忠的同辈人严志和和朱老明，就曾联合过二十八户穷人，告过冯老兰，尽管官司是打到县输到县，打到省输到省，打到大理院输到大理院，但也给四十八村人民留下了深刻的印象，人们忘不了这“祖辈几代的新仇旧恨”。
    不过，无论是老一代的朱老巩，严老祥也好，第二代的朱老忠、严志和、朱老明也好，他们虽然都有着世代农民不屈服的斗争性格，他们却没有找到正当的斗争途径，基本上仍然是以个人反抗，来和雄厚的封建势力作对。在斗争方式上，也不能突破封建势力的范围，因此，他们只能是屡战屡败，没有能力改变被压迫的阶级地位。这是封建社会农民斗争的历史的悲剧。
    然而，历史的洪流，终于显示出新的方向。无产阶级的政党——共产党深入到农村里来了，这就使得农民和地主的斗争完全改变了面貌。在共产党教养下的新的一代——严志和的儿子运涛，江涛，虽然继承了他们父祖两代的勇于斗争的性格，却走上了全新的革命的道路。在党的领导下，老的一代的正义的复仇的性格和新的一代共产党员的品质的结合，这就给革命准备下了一支坚强的生力军。轰轰烈烈的“反割头税运动”，就是在这样的基础上展开的。这是冯家大院在四十八村人民中间的封建统治，第一次受到农民的坚决的回击。而冯老兰对头冤家的第三代——严江涛，朱大贵，都成了这次运动中的领导者和骨干人物。在有名的二师学潮中间，也正是这些党所教养出来的年轻的农民子弟，表现了坚决斗争至死不屈的英雄气魄。
    在反映这些轰轰烈烈的斗争的同时，作者细致地描绘了这痛苦的历史年代受着残酷剥削和压迫的农民生活，而且像浮雕一样刻划了老一代农民和新生一代的不同的斗争性格和革命性格。朱老忠、严志和、朱老明、伍老拔，这些老一代人物的性格特色，固然彼此不能混同，就是运涛、江涛、张嘉庆、大贵、二贵、春兰、严萍这些新生一代的人物，也都有着各自不同的性格特征。
    现在我们所能看到的，还是“红旗谱”的第一部的内容，“红旗谱”里的年轻的英雄们的性格还正在发展，因此，在这里，我们先选择两个突出的老一代的性格——朱老忠和严志和，来谈一谈。
    作者在“文艺报”的一次座谈会（注）上，回忆最初写朱老忠的过程时，曾经说过这样一段话：“……创作的动机，来自这样一件动人的事：两个革命同志被敌人杀害以后，他的父亲到冀中区来找区党委，要弄清他的儿子是怎样牺牲的，当时我看见这个老人神情很乐观，身体也矫健，谈笑风生，不像是死了两个儿子的人，我和这位老人也谈过话，很受感动，这时朱老忠的形象就在我脑子里开始形成了。”
    作者为了这个老人，最初写了一个短篇“三个布尔什维克的爸爸”，后来还曾经把它发展成中篇，最后是把他写进了“红旗谱”。
    作者关于这个人物的创作过程的叙述，虽然是简短的，但很值得我们深思。我相信，凡是读过“红旗谱”的人，谁都会承认，作品里给人们留下深刻印象的人物，就是朱老忠。这说明作者三次发展这个性格，确实是收到了显著的艺术效果。这个性格所以这样真实感人，主要的原因，是由于作家创造这个人物，能够深入到形成这个性格的历史境界里去。朱老忠的坚强、果断，有胆识，勇于斗争，朱老忠的最后成为一个共产党员，是通过他自己的生活道路必然发展的结果。朱老忠是一个从血泊恨海里经过千锤百炼而长大起来的战士，苦难的经历，为复仇而燃烧着永不屈服的生活信心，只要一进入党的熔炉，立刻就会凝结成坚而韧的钢。朱老忠，这是毛主席所说的那种“中国人民最可宝贵的性格”。它不仅具有现实意义，而且具有深刻的历史意义。在这个人物身上，概括着富有斗争传统的广大中国农民的历史性格。
    和朱老忠阶级出身虽然相近，而生活遭遇却完全不同的严志和，从生活和性格上表现出来的特色，就和朱老忠有显著的差异。他虽然也痛恨冯老兰，也深刻地记忆着世代血仇，但是，他终究有一块“宝地”，有一个温暖的家，有两个又聪明又能干的儿子。而且从他的生活命运来看，严志和没有经过朱老忠那样的痛苦的血的洗礼，也没有朱老忠那种闯荡关东顽强地和生活搏斗的丰富经验。他是在小的“温室”里长大的。有父母的爱护，有涛他娘的体贴，有“宝地”保证他的小康之家的生活。这就减弱了他对现实顽强斗争的信心，也影响了他对斗争生活的锐敏的感受力。作者充分地描写了严志和性格中的这种矛盾，运涛的被捕，“宝地”的丧失，曾经怎样强烈地打击了严志和，他满指望江涛不要重复他哥哥的道路，结果反动派把江涛也从他手里夺去了。已经成为共产党员的严志和，险些在这种强大的打击面前自杀。严志和，这个忠实勤劳而又夹杂着一些软弱的性格，正是在旧中国千百万破产中农的活的写照。朱老忠、严志和这两个形象在作者的笔下，无论从性格塑造和内心生活的描写来看，都有着作者的艺术上的独创性。
    从总的方面来看，“红旗谱”虽然有这些主要的优点，但是，无论思想上、艺术上，“红旗谱”也还显然存在着一些缺陷，需要作者认真地思考。
    “红旗谱”的第一部，对于党的领导的描写，是不够鲜明，也不够突出的。在轰轰烈烈的反割头税的运动里，太突出了江涛个人的号召力，对于党的细致而复杂的农村工作，党的集体领导，缺乏充分的描写。还有不少地方可以看出来，对于党的工作，作者不能活现它们，而只借助于政策指示的简单说明。当时当地的党的领导人——贾湘农，也应该说是“红旗谱”里最不成功的人物，像是一个概念的影子。他的领导农村工作，给人的印象似乎只是在偶然的机会里遇到了运涛，才触动了灵机。他的领导方法，也带有偶然的灵感式的因素。作为一个党的领导者，我们还不能从他身上看到党的生龙活虎的活动能力。而作者费了很多力气热情描写的，又显然是残留在他身上的一些书生气。
    就是在最成功的人物——朱老忠和严志和的身上，也还留着一些粗糙的痕迹。作为一个历史的性格，朱老忠的形象是非常鲜明的。但从一个个人反抗的性格，过渡到一个共产主义者，作者对于他的思想观念的变化，以及对党的充分信任的那种现实根据，还缺乏有说服力的描写，有些地方的匆促交代，像写朱老忠的信任红军，是由于在东北受到苏联革命的影响，也都稍嫌简单了些。尤其是严志和的转变，是写得太轻易了。而在前半部写得泼辣有生气的春兰，后面写得又似乎太暗淡了。仿佛运涛的被捕完全带走了她的灵魂，却没有给她生活中带来斗争的勇气。
    从艺术上看，“红旗谱”的人物的形体描写，性格刻划和生活语言的运用，都吸取了古典小说动画式的手法，这给他描写的人物增加了不少的生气。但是，在情节的构造上，作者却采取了跳跃的形式，而且分章分节的过于琐细，也似乎影响了性格和情节的突出和鲜明，这些都使人看起来要费很大精力去衔接和联想，这就不能不影响到艺术效果。我们希望这一切缺憾，能在“红旗谱”的第二部和第一部的第二版中，得到充分地弥补。这就会使得这部史诗性的作品更加完整。
