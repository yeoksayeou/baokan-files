Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 15th: Antara News Agency reported that Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda announced today that the aircraft that bombed the Mandai Air Force Base in Makassar on the morning of the 13th was an American-made B-25 twin-engine bomber. He said the Indonesian government already knew the plane had flown in from the north. He did not specify from which country it came.

Prime Minister Djuanda said he believed the purpose of the bombing of the Mandai Air Force Base was to create chaos at a time when the Central Sumatra rebel group was nearing its demise. He pointed out that when the Indonesian government forces attacked the rebels in Pekanbaru, Central Sumatra, foreign warships also staged a demonstration in the Singapore Strait, which was also intended to create chaos.

Prime Minister Djuanda said the Indonesian government would not retreat a single step in continuing military action against the rebels.

According to the Indonesian National News Agency today, quoting authoritative sources, the aircraft that attacked Makassar was a B-25 type aircraft belonging to Taiwan, and it was based in the Philippines. Many people personally saw that the markings on the aircraft were very similar to those of American aircraft.

The news agency said that prior to this incident, foreign aircraft had been constantly practicing over northern Indonesia. On March 25, a seaplane flew over Morotai in North Maluku, and a small group of people parachuted there with radio equipment. Government armed forces are now searching for these border-crossing elements. On March 27, aircraft flew over Kendari in North Sulawesi several times. On the same day, an aircraft without national insignia made an emergency landing in Davao in the southern Philippines. It was later proven that the crew of the aircraft were all Americans. The type of aircraft was the same as the aircraft that was reported in the Philippine newspapers as being riddled with bullet holes. The bullet holes on the plane were caused by local guerrillas loyal to the central government while the plane was practicing over Kendari.

The news agency said that an American pilot named James Fleming is actively assisting the rebel group. He once arranged for the rebel leader, Sumual, to go to the US Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. He also ordered his assistant to purchase weapons for the Hussein group. He himself is shuttling between Taiwan and the Philippines for the rebel group. Fleming runs an air transport company. The Indonesian National News Agency also listed a list of people assisting the rebels, including a US Embassy staff member in the Philippines, a former Philippine Air Force personnel, a Philippine Major, and some US Navy personnel stationed in the Philippines.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 14th: The Indonesian Air Force Headquarters issued a communique on the 14th stating that an unidentified twin-engine aircraft attacked the Indonesian Mandai Air Force Base in Makassar on April 13th from 5:35 am to 5:55 am.

The communique said that the garrison of the Mandai Air Force Base put up a tenacious resistance to the air raid and retaliated with anti-aircraft guns. There were no casualties at the base, and the material damage was slight and could be repaired quickly. The communique said that the air force personnel at the Mandai Air Force Base were in high spirits and were not affected by the air raid at all.

    美国妄图制造混乱挽救叛乱分子
    朱安达表示决不后退一步
    台湾的美制轰炸机从菲律宾空袭望加锡
    据新华社雅加达15日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚总理朱安达今天宣布，在13日早上轰炸望加锡的曼代空军基地的飞机是一架美国制造的B—25型双引擎轰炸机。他说，印度尼西亚政府已经知道这架飞机是从北方飞来的。他没有说明是从哪一个国家来的。
    朱安达总理说，他认为轰炸曼代空军基地的行动的目的，是想在中苏门答腊叛乱集团接近灭亡的时候制造混乱。他指出，在印度尼西亚政府军进攻中苏门答腊北干巴鲁的叛军的时候，也曾经有外国军舰在新加坡海面上举行示威，这同样也是为了制造混乱。
    朱安达总理说，印度尼西亚政府在继续对叛乱分子采取军事行动方面决不后退一步。
    据印度尼西亚民族通讯社今天引述权威人士的话说，袭击望加锡的那架飞机是属于台湾的B—25型飞机，它是以菲律宾为基地的。许多人亲眼看到飞机上的标志跟美国飞机的标志很相似。
    这家通讯社说，在这一事件发生以前，就曾经有外国飞机不断在印度尼西亚北部上空演习。3月25日，有一架水陆两用飞机飞过马鲁古北部的毛罗塔上空，有一小批人携带无线电设备在那里空降。政府武装部队现在正在搜查这批偷越国境分子。3月27日，有飞机几次飞过苏拉威西北部的肯达里上空。在同一天，一架没有国徽的飞机在菲律宾南部的纳卯作紧急降陆。后来证明这架飞机上的飞行人员全是美国人。飞机的类型和菲律宾报纸报道的那架全身满是弹洞的飞机是一样的。飞机上的弹洞是在肯达里上空演习时被效忠中央政府的地方游击队打中所造成的。
    这家通讯社说，有一个名叫詹姆·弗莱明的美国飞行员正在积极协助叛乱集团。他曾经为叛乱分子头目苏穆阿尔安排前往美国在菲律宾的克拉克空军基地。他还命令他的助手为侯赛尼集团购买武器。他自己正在为叛乱集团奔走于台湾和菲律宾之间。弗莱明经营着一家航空运输公司。印度尼西亚民族通讯社还列举了一批协助叛乱分子的名单，其中包括一名美国驻菲律宾大使馆人员、一名前菲律宾空军人员、一名菲律宾少校以及一些驻在菲律宾的美国海军人员。
    据新华社雅加达14日电　印度尼西亚空军总部14日发表公报说，有一架来历不明的双引擎飞机在4月13日早上五时三十五分到五时五十五分袭击了印度尼西亚望加锡的曼代空军基地。
    公报说，曼代空军基地的驻军对空袭进行了顽强的抵抗，并且使用高射炮还击。基地上没有任何伤亡，物质上的损失很轻微，可以很快地修复。公报说，在曼代空军基地的空军部队人员斗志高昂，丝毫没有受到空袭的影响。
