Xinhua News Agency, San Francisco, April 13th: Gaither, Chairman of the Security Resources Panel of the U.S. President's Science Advisory Committee, delivered a speech on the 12th, advocating that the United States accelerate the building of "relative strength." He said that compared to the Soviet Union and China, America's "relative strength" is declining.

Gaither was the drafter of the notorious "Gaither Committee" report, revealed in December last year, which presented the U.S. government with a crazy atomic armament plan.

He advocated that the United States should "resolutely take action, and take action now" to establish the so-called "relative strength of the United States."

Gaither expressed extreme concern about the Soviet Union's booming economic power and advanced science. He said, "Russia currently produces 500 engineers for every billion dollars of its gross national product, while we only produce about 60." He admitted that even "conservative economic views" consider that the Soviet Union's "future" industrial growth rate is likely to "greatly" exceed that of the United States.

Gaither said that the Soviet Union's forty-year history is a "stunning history," "forty years of roaring industrialization." He said, "The Russians will not only maintain, but will actually increase their rate of industrial and economic development."

Gaither also said that the United States "should not underestimate the potential of Red China." He said that it is based on these factors that he had to conclude that America's "relative strength is declining."

    东风吹得原子狂人惊叫
    盖瑟鼓吹建立美国“相对力量”
    据新华社13日讯　旧金山消息：美国总统科学顾问委员会安全资源小组主席盖瑟12日发表演讲，鼓吹美国要加速建立“相对力量”。他说，美国同苏联和中国相比，它的“相对力量”正在衰退。
    盖瑟是去年12月透露的臭名昭著的“盖瑟委员会”报告的起草人，这个报告向美国政府提出了一个疯狂的原子备战计划。
    他主张美国要“坚决地行动起来，并且现在就行动起来”来建立所谓“美国的相对力量”。
    盖瑟对苏联蓬勃发展的强大经济力量和先进科学表示极为忧虑。他说，“俄国目前国民总产值中每十亿美元就培养出五百名工程师，而我们却只培养出约六十名。”他承认，即使是“保守的经济见解”，也认为苏联“将来的”工业增长的速度很可能会“大大地”超过美国。
    盖瑟说，苏联四十年的历史是“惊人的历史”，“是轰然一声的工业化的四十年”。他说，“俄国人不仅将保持，而且实际上将提高他们的工业发展和经济发展的速度”。
    盖瑟又说，美国“也不要低估红色中国的潜力”。他说，就是根据这些，他才不得不作出美国的“相对力量正在衰退”的结论。
