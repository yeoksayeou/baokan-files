	Peach Blossoms and Green Willows Speak of Qingming

	At Qingming, people often think of the Cold Food Festival first. The Cold Food Festival is generally 105 days after the winter solstice, that is, the day before the Qingming Festival; some believe it is 106 days after the winter solstice, with Qingming being the Cold Food Festival.

	According to old customs, no fire is allowed during the Cold Food Festival. It is said to be in memory of Jie Zitui. Jie Zitui was a person from the State of Jin during the Spring and Autumn period. At that time, Prince Chong'er of Jin was exiled. Jie Zitui was loyal to Chong'er in exile in order to seek the prosperity of Jin, hoping that Chong'er would achieve something. Later, Chong'er returned to his country and became the ruler, namely Duke Wen of Jin. After Duke Wen of Jin gained fame and position, he, like other followers, deceived those above and below him and pursued fame and fortune, but he was ungrateful to Jie Zitui, who had been loyal to him in the past, and no longer valued him. Jie Zitui saw through the "deceptive and unjust" Duke Wen, so he and his elderly mother retired to Mian Mountain. Duke Wen of Jin went to Mian Mountain to find Jie Zitui in order to cover up his mistakes. Mian Mountain was so vast that he could not find him anywhere, so Duke Wen of Jin ordered the mountain to be burned, wanting to force Jie Zitui and his mother down the mountain with fire. The fire burned for three days and three nights, and Mian Mountain had become a barren, charred ridge, but still no trace of Jie Zitui and his mother was found. Finally, their bodies were found under a willow tree.

	In order to mourn Jie Zitui, everyone forbade fire and cooking on this day. The food for this day had to be prepared in advance by each family, so this day was called the Cold Food Festival.

	Entering the Cold Food Festival, it is the season of peach blossoms and green willows. "Green silk smoke fills the streets with willows, painting the second month of Qingming," the spring is indeed very strong. Therefore, there are also customs of "spring outing" and "inserting willows" in various places, among which the most important activity is sweeping tombs. Tomb sweeping during Qingming probably began in the Tang Dynasty. During Qingming, the earth's atmosphere warms up, trees grow and grass grows; ice rivers thaw, and streams and rivers flow gurglingly. The tombs on the mountain have either been washed away by water or have grown lush green grass, so people go to the graves of their relatives and ancestors to repair or reinforce them, also expressing their remembrance of the dead.

	In the past, during the Qingming season, the rich and idle would of course take advantage of the festival to travel and enjoy the scenery, while the broad masses of working people were in hunger and cold, "The poor often have no fire in their homes, not only during the Ming Dynasty for Zitui." Therefore, every spring, they only think about how to sow in time and strive for a good harvest so that they can get enough food and clothing. Around the Cold Food Festival, it is the time to seize the opportunity for plowing and sowing. "Do not be ahead of the second month for Qingming, do not be behind the third month for Qingming" is a proverb about seed soaking that the broad masses of farmers have summarized from their production practice. Because "Qingming in the second month" is when the spring is still cold and the seeds are difficult to germinate; "Qingming in the third month" is when spring is about to end, and if the seeds are not soaked again, the production season will be too late.

    桃红柳绿说清明
    文农
    清明，人们往往先想到寒食节。寒食节一般在冬至后一百零五日，即清明节前一天；也有认为在冬至后一百零六天，清明即寒食的。
    照旧俗，寒食节要禁烟火。据说是为了纪念介子推。介子推，春秋晋国人。当时晋国公子重耳被逐在外。介子推为了图谋晋国的强盛，尽忠于流亡中的重耳，企望重耳有所作为。后来重耳回国，作了国君，便是晋文公。晋文公既得名位，便同其他从者上下欺蔽，追逐名利，而对过去忠心耿耿的介子推却忘恩负义，不再重视他。介子推看透了“谲而不正”的文公，便偕同年老的母亲隐居绵山。晋文公为了掩饰自己的过失，到绵山去寻访介子推。偌大的绵山，遍访不得，晋文公便下令烧山，想用火逼介子推母子俩下山来。这场火整整烧了三天三夜，绵山已变成一片枯焦的秃岭，可是仍不见介子推母子的踪迹。最后才在一棵柳树下发现他们的尸首。
    人们为了哀悼介子推，大家便在这天禁火举炊。这天的饮食，每家都要事先准备好，所以就把这天称为寒食节。
    进入寒食，已是桃红柳绿的时节。“满街杨柳绿丝烟，画出清明二月天”，春意确实已经很浓了。因此各地又有“踏青”、“插柳”的习俗，其中最重要的活动是祭扫坟墓。清明扫墓，大约始于唐朝。清明时候，地气转暖，木生草长；冰河解冻，溪河流水潺潺。那山上的墓冢，或被水冲陷了，或已长上萋萋青草，因此人们踏青到自己的亲人和祖坟上去修葺或者加固一番，也表示对死者的追念。
    过去，每逢清明时节，有钱有闲的人，当然会借节日游山玩水，而广大的劳动人民却处于饥寒之中，“贫居往往无烟火，不独明朝为子推”。因此，每到春天，只看如何及时播种争取丰收，使自己能够得一温饱。寒食前后，正是抢耕播种的时候。“二月清明莫在前，三月清明莫在后”，便是广大农民从生产实践中总结出来的关于浸种的谚语。因为“二月清明”，正是春寒料峭，种谷难萌芽；“三月清明”，春又将残，再不浸种，生产的季节就会太迟了。
