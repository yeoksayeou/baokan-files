The African States Conference, attended by eight independent African nations (the United Arab Republic, Ghana, Sudan, Ethiopia, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, and Liberia), is scheduled to open today in Accra, the capital of Ghana. This is the first pan-African conference held by independent African states themselves in African history. Preparations for the African States Conference began after Ghana's independence last year.

The provisional agenda for this African States Conference includes: exchanging views on foreign policy, especially foreign policy related to the African continent; the future of dependent African territories (particularly the Algerian question); racial issues and steps to be taken to defend the independence and sovereignty of African nations; and ways and means to enhance economic cooperation between African nations.

Below is a brief introduction to the eight countries participating in the African States Conference.

    United Arab Republic

    The United Arab Republic is a new nation that was born on February 1st of this year, spanning Asia and Africa. Its territory includes the 994,300 square kilometers of the Egyptian region in the northeast corner of Africa and the 187,000 square kilometers of the Syrian region on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. Although the territories are not connected, sea routes across the Mediterranean are unobstructed. The population of the United Arab Republic is approximately 28 million, the vast majority of whom are Arabs, with about 90% of the population adhering to Islam.

    After its establishment, the United Arab Republic announced that it would continue to pursue a peaceful and neutral foreign policy and firmly oppose all colonialist schemes of aggression.

    Ghana

    Ghana, which gained independence on March 6, 1957, is located on the west coast of Africa. It has an area of more than 237,800 square kilometers and a population of over four million, the vast majority of whom are Black Africans. It has mineral deposits such as gold, aluminum, diamonds, and manganese, and is rich in cocoa and timber.

    Ghana's Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah has announced that Ghana will not participate in any bloc and has advocated uniting African countries.

    Republic of Sudan

    Sudan, which gained independence on January 1, 1956, is located in northeastern Africa, with an area of more than 2.5 million square kilometers and a population of 12 million. The north is mainly Arab, adhering to Islam; the south is Black, including the Nuer and Nubian people. The Hadendoa people live along the Red Sea coast. Sudan is an agricultural country.

    Sudan is a participant in the Bandung Conference. It has repeatedly expressed its support for the spirit of the Bandung Conference resolutions and advocates solidarity with all countries, especially the Arab people, both East and West.

    Kingdom of Ethiopia

    Ethiopia is located in the northeast corner of Africa, with an area of more than one million square kilometers. Half of its total area is highland. It has a population of 16 million, consisting of 50 ethnic groups, including the Amhara and Galla, and is a Christian nation.

    The Ethiopian people mainly engage in animal husbandry and agriculture, producing coffee, rubber, cotton, and other products.

    Ethiopia became an independent nation around the eleventh century BC. It was occupied by Italian fascists in 1936 and regained its independence after the war. Ethiopia participated in the Asian-African Conference and has repeatedly stated that it will develop cultural and economic ties with various countries in accordance with the spirit of the Bandung Conference.

    Tunisia

    Tunisia is an ancient North African country that gained independence on March 20, 1956. It has an area of 155,800 square kilometers and a population of approximately 3.8 million, most of whom are Arabs adhering to Islam.

    Tunisia is still under serious threat from colonialist aggression. The French Air Force bombing Tunisian villages is proof of this. The United States is attempting to use "mediation" of this incident to replace France and control Tunisia.

    Morocco

    Morocco gained independence in 1956. It has an area of 445,577 square kilometers and a population of approximately 9.8 million, mainly Berbers, Arabs, and Jews.

    Like Tunisia, after gaining independence, Morocco still has French troops stationed there, its southern territory is occupied by France and Spain, and the United States also maintains military bases in Morocco. The Moroccan people are continuing to fight to recover the southern territory and strive for independence and complete sovereignty.

    United Kingdom of Libya

    Libya gained independence in 1951. It has an area of more than 1.7 million square kilometers and a population of over one million, most of whom are Arabs, with some Berbers and Black Africans in the western and southern regions.

    Libya is an economically backward agricultural country, with two-thirds of its territory being desert.

    Libya is a participant in the Asian-African Conference. The United States and Britain both maintain military bases in Libya.

    Republic of Liberia

    Liberia is a Black African country on the Atlantic coast of West Africa, with an area of 111,327 square kilometers and a population of approximately 2.5 million.

    Since the fifteenth century, Liberia has been a place for Western colonists to plunder and traffic slaves, and has long been subjected to cruel exploitation by the United States. The United States still possesses strong economic power in Liberia. Liberia is a participant in the Asian-African Conference.

    非洲国家会议和参加国
    八个非洲独立国家（阿拉伯联合共和国、加纳、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚、利比亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥和利比里亚）参加的非洲国家会议，今天就要在加纳的首都阿克拉开幕了。非洲独立国家自己举行全洲性的会议，在非洲历史上还是第一次。非洲独立国家会议的筹备工作是在去年加纳独立后开始的。
    这次非洲国家会议将要讨论的暂定议程是：就外交政策特别是与非洲大陆有关的外交政策交换意见，非洲的附属国的前途（特别是阿尔及利亚问题），种族问题和保卫非洲国家独立和主权所要采取的步骤，增进非洲国家之间的经济合作的途径和方法等问题。
    下面是参加非洲国家会议八个国家的简单介绍。
    阿拉伯联合共和国
    阿拉伯联合共和国是今年2月1日诞生的新国家，地跨亚非两洲，领土包括非洲东北角的九十九万四千三百平方公里的埃及地区和地中海东岸的十八万七千平方公里的叙利亚地区。领土虽然不连在一起，但是地中海的水路可以通行无阻。阿拉伯联合共和国人口约二千八百万，绝大多数是阿拉伯人，信仰伊斯兰教的约占全人口的90％。
    阿拉伯联合共和国成立后，曾宣布它继续执行和平中立的外交政策，坚决反对殖民主义的一切侵略阴谋。
    加纳
    1957年3月6日取得独立的加纳，位于非洲西海岸，面积有二十三万七千八百多平方公里，人口四百余万，绝大部分是黑人。拥有黄金、铝、金刚石、锰等矿藏，盛产可可和木材。
    加纳总理恩克鲁玛曾宣布加纳不参加任何集团，倡议把非洲国家联合起来。
    苏丹共和国
    苏丹是在1956年1月1日获得独立的国家，位于非洲东北部，面积二百五十多万平方公里，人口一千二百万。北部主要是阿拉伯人，信奉伊斯兰教；南部是黑人，其中有努尔人和努比亚人。在红海沿岸住着哈登道瓦人，苏丹是一个农业国。
    苏丹是万隆会议的参加国，它多次表示支持万隆会议的决议精神，并主张同东西方各国特别是阿拉伯人民的团结。
    埃塞俄比亚王国
    埃塞俄比亚位于非洲东北角，面积为一百多万平方公里，全部面积中有一半是高原地带，人口有一千六百万人，有阿姆哈拉族、盖拉族等五十个种族，是一个信奉基督教的国家。
    埃塞俄比亚人民以畜牧业和农业为主，出产咖啡、橡胶、棉花等。
    埃塞俄比亚在纪元前十一世纪左右就已经成为一个独立的国家。1936年为意大利法西斯占领。战后恢复了独立。埃塞俄比亚参加了亚非会议，并几次声明要按照万隆会议的精神，发展同各国间的文化与经济的联系。
    突尼斯
    突尼斯是在1956年3月20日获得独立的北非文明古国。面积有十五万五千八百平方公里，人口约有三百八十万，其中大部分是阿拉伯人，信仰伊斯兰教。
    突尼斯现在仍然受到殖民主义侵略的严重威胁。法国空军轰炸突尼斯村庄的事件，就是证明。美国正企图利用对这一事件的“斡旋”，取代法国，控制突尼斯。摩洛哥
    摩洛哥在1956年取得了独立。面积有四十四万五千五百七十七平方公里，人口约九百八十万，主要是柏伯尔人、阿拉伯人和犹太人。
    像突尼斯一样，摩洛哥独立后，仍有法国军队驻扎，南部领土被法国和西班牙占领着，美国也在摩洛哥据有军事基地。摩洛哥人民正继续为收回南部领土、争取独立和主权的完整而斗争。
    利比亚联合王国
    利比亚于1951年获得独立。面积有一百七十多万平方公里，人口一百多万，其中大部分是阿拉伯人，只有西部和南部地区有些柏伯尔人和黑人。
    利比亚是一个经济落后的农业国，境内有三分之二的地区是沙漠地带。
    利比亚是亚非会议的参加国。美国和英国都在利比亚据有军事基地。
    利比里亚共和国
    利比里亚是非洲西部大西洋沿岸的一个黑人国家，面积共十一万一千三百二十七平方公里，人口约二百五十万。
    利比里亚自十五世纪起就成了西方殖民者掠夺与贩卖奴隶的地方，长期受到美国残酷的掠夺。现在美国在利比里亚仍拥有雄厚的经济势力。利比里亚是亚非会议的参加国。
