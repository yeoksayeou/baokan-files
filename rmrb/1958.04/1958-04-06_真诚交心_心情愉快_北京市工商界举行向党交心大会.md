Xinhua News Agency, April 5th—"Handing over our hearts to the Party, to the people, and to socialism" is the guarantee proposed by many industrialists and businessmen in Beijing at the Beijing Industrial and Commercial Circles' Heart-to-Party Reporting Conference held on the 5th.

Over 10,000 industrialists and businessmen participated in the conference, and many people voluntarily shared many ideological understandings that they previously considered shameful. Le Songsheng, chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "Over the past few years, the Party has provided me with a lot of education and care, but my attitude towards the Party has been lukewarm. I only spoke three-tenths of my mind to the Party, and I was of two minds. He is determined to reveal all the dirty things in his 'pocket,' transform the three minds into one, and forever follow the Party on the socialist road. Chang Zijiu, vice chairman of the Beijing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, spoke at the meeting about his past attitude towards the Party and the government, and his erroneous ideas regarding the Five-Anti Campaign, the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries movement, and taxation. Chang Zijiu expressed that in the Heart-to-Party movement, he must be sincere, dig deep, and confess everything completely.

Many industrialists and businessmen who have already participated in physical labor reported at the meeting on their gains in labor. They all believed that participating in physical labor is a good way for bourgeois elements to undergo transformation.

Cui Yueli, head of the United Front Work Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. He said: "The fact that industrialists and businessmen have begun to open their hearts to the Party shows that the self-transformation movement in industrial and commercial circles is being carried out more extensively and deeply. Opening one's heart to the Party is a further revolution in political thought. There will be some pain at the beginning, but after handing over one's heart and getting rid of ideological baggage, one will definitely be happy." He hopes that industrialists and businessmen will reap a bountiful harvest in the revolution of politics and thought.

    真诚交心　心情愉快
    北京市工商界举行向党交心大会
    据新华社5日讯　把心交给党交给人民交给社会主义，这是北京市许多工商业者在5日举行的北京市工商界向党交心汇报大会上提出的保证。
    参加大会的有一万多名工商业者，有许多人在会上自动地把很多以往认为见不得人的思想认识谈了出来。北京市工商业联合会主任委员乐松生说：几年来党对我进行了很多教育和照顾，但是我对党的态度若即若离，向党只说三分话，对党三心二意。他决心把“口袋”里的脏东西全翻出来，化三心二意为一心一意，永远跟着党走社会主义道路。中国民主建国会北京市委员会副主任委员常子久在会上谈了他过去对党和政府的态度，五反、肃反运动和税收等方面的错误思想。常子久表示在向党交心运动中，一定要交得真、挖得深、倒得干净。
    许多已经参加体力劳动的工商业者，在会上汇报了他们在劳动中的收获，他们都认为：参加体力劳动是资产阶级分子进行脱胎换骨改造的好办法。
    中共北京市委统战部部长崔月犁在会上讲了话。他说：工商业者开始向党交心，说明了工商界自我改造运动进行得更广泛更深入了。向党交心，是进一步在政治思想上进行革命，开始时是会有些痛苦的，但是交出心来、丢掉思想包袱以后，心情一定会愉快。他希望工商业者在政治、思想的革命中获得丰收。
