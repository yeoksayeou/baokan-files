Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch:

    The Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture is located on the south bank of the turbulent Jinsha River, bordering the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture to the west. It is inhabited by ten ethnic groups, including Yi, Han, Miao, Dai, Hui, Bai, Hani, Lisu, Zhuang, and Yao, with a total population of over 1,673,000. Among them, the Yi people number over 385,000, accounting for 23.04% of the prefecture's population. The autonomous prefecture covers an area of approximately 38,000 square kilometers, with abundant underground mineral deposits, forest resources, and waterpower resources. More than 300 mineral resources such as lead, copper, iron, petroleum, asbestos, and coal have been discovered so far, and the waterpower resources available for power generation are no less than several million kilowatts. Before liberation, the reactionary ruling class implemented a brutal "using barbarians to control barbarians" policy, which scattered more than 300,000 Yi people in fifteen counties throughout the region, divided into more than forty different branches or names. However, all ethnic groups have established close relationships in the long-term common labor throughout history. The minority ethnic groups in the mountainous areas and the Han people in the dam areas supply each other with local specialties, grains, and handicrafts, and each ethnic group learns from each other's farming experience. In 1935, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through here during the Long March, publicizing the Communist Party's propositions to the people of all ethnic groups. From then on, the Chuxiong area began a new stage of uniting all ethnic groups to resist the ruling class. In 1948, they finally established a joint armed force of all ethnic groups, which became a detachment of the Border Column led by the Party at that time, making contributions to the common liberation cause of all ethnic groups.
    Before liberation, under the oppression of the rulers, the minority ethnic groups in the Chuxiong area lived in extreme poverty. Many areas used the primitive "slash-and-burn" cultivation methods, the cultivated land was not fixed, and some areas produced less than one hundred catties of grain per mu. After liberation, under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, the people of all ethnic groups greatly developed production and improved their lives through common labor. Last year, the total grain output of the prefecture increased from more than 900 million catties in 1952 to more than 1.2 billion catties, and the average per capita increased from 635 catties to 765 catties per year. Local industry and transportation have also developed rapidly. In 1952, there were only seven dilapidated small enterprises in the region, and now there are 233 various factories and mines. All fifteen counties in the region are accessible by car.
    The Party and the government also pay great attention to the national education cause here. At present, there are more than 160,000 middle and primary school students in the prefecture, of which more than 35,000 are from minority ethnic groups. In the vast rural areas, more than 80,000 farmers of all ethnic groups have also picked up books and started to learn culture. In recent years, the Party has trained a large number of communist cadres from minority ethnic groups in the Chuxiong area, of which more than 1,000 can independently undertake the leadership work at the county, district, and township levels. At the same time, there are more than 5,000 communist party members and nearly 10,000 communist youth league members from minority ethnic groups in the prefecture. The people of all ethnic groups call the party and communist youth league organizations at all levels "everlasting stakes," believing that this is a reliable guarantee for all ethnic groups to move towards socialism.

    楚雄彝族自治州
    楚雄彝族自治州位于汹涌澎湃的金沙江的南岸，西面与大理白族自治州相联。境内杂居着彝、汉、苗、傣、回、白、哈尼、傈僳、僮族和瑶族等十种民族，人口共一百六十七万三千多，其中彝族三十八万五千多人，占全州人口的23.04％。自治州的面积约三万八千多平方公里，地下矿藏、森林资源和水力资源都非常丰富。目前已经发现的铅、铜、铁、石油、石棉和煤等各种矿产资源已有三百多处，可供发电用的水力资源不下数百万瓩。解放前，反动统治阶级在这里施行残暴的“以夷治夷”政策，使三十多万彝族散居在全区十五个县内，分为四十多种不同支系或名称。但是，各民族却在历史上长期的共同劳动中，建立了密切的关系。山区各少数民族和坝区汉族人民互相供应土特产品、粮食和手工业品，各民族互相学习耕作经验。1935年，中国工农红军在长征中经过这里，向各族人民宣传共产党的主张。从那时起，楚雄地区就开始了各民族联合反抗统治阶级的新阶段。1948年，他们终于建立了一支各族联合的武装力量，成为当时党所领导的边疆纵队的一个支队，对各民族共同的解放事业做出了贡献。
    解放前，楚雄地区的少数民族在统治者的压迫下，生活极端贫困，许多地区沿用着“刀耕火种”的原始耕作方法，耕地不固定，有的亩产粮食还不到一百斤。解放后，各族人民在党和政府的领导、扶持下，用共同的劳动大大发展了生产，改善了生活。去年，全州的粮食总产量已由1952年的九亿多斤增长到十二亿多斤，每人每年平均由六百三十五斤提高到七百六十五斤。地方工业和交通运输也得到了迅速发展，1952年，全区只有七个破烂不堪的小企业，现在已有各类厂矿二百三十三座。全区十五个县，全部通汽车。
    党和政府也十分关心这里的民族教育事业。目前，全州中、小学学生已达十六万多人，其中少数民族就有三万五千多人。在广大农村，还有八万多各族农民拿起了书本开始学文化。党在楚雄地区几年来培养了大批少数民族的共产主义干部，其中能独立担负县、区、乡三级领导工作的就有一千多人。同时，全州有五千多名少数民族共产党员和近万名共青团员，各族人民把党和共青团的各级组织称做“万年桩”，认为这是各民族走向社会主义的可靠保障。
