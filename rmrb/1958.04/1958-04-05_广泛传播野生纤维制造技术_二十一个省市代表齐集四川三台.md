　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 4th: Over four hundred representatives from twenty-one provinces and cities across the country are gathered in Santai County, Sichuan Province, to learn the manufacturing methods of wild fibers. Most of them have now mastered the operating techniques of using several raw materials such as cotton stalk hemp, Eulalia (Imperata cylindrica), rice straw, banana, and paper mulberry bark to manufacture fiber, and have personally produced fiber products that resemble cotton.

　　This training in wild fiber manufacturing technology was initiated by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and entrusted to the Santai County Wild Fiber Factory, affiliated with the Santai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative. The representatives sent from various regions include members from supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and other departments. The training period is one month and is expected to end in mid-April. Representatives from provinces such as Zhejiang, Shandong, and Henan, after mastering the basic manufacturing techniques, have already returned early to begin preparations for establishing factories and producing wild fiber in large quantities.

    广泛传播野生纤维制造技术
    二十一个省市代表齐集四川三台
    据新华社成都4日电　全国二十一个省（市）的四百多名代表正在四川省三台县集中学习野生纤维的制造方法。他们中的大多数人，现在已经掌握了棉秆麻、蓑草（龙须草）、稻草、芭蕉和构树皮等几种原料制造纤维的操作技术，并且都亲手制出了像棉花一样的纤维成品。
    这次野生纤维制造技术的传授，是由全国供销合作社总社发起，委托三台县供销社附设三台县野生纤维工厂举办的。各地派来的代表中，包括有供销社、手工业社及其他部门的成员。学习时间是一个月，预计4月中旬结束。浙江、山东、河南等省的代表，在掌握了基本制造技术以后，一部分人已提前回去，着手筹备建立工厂，大量生产野生纤维。
