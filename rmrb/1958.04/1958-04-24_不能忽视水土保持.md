    Water and Soil Conservation Cannot Be Ignored

    On April 10th, the People's Daily published several new folk songs from Hunan on page 8.  The folk songs of the Wubai Agricultural Cooperative in Lixian County included these two lines: "Peeling the skin off the high mountains," "Washing the faces of the rock heads"; the last line of the folk song from the Shaoshan Cooperative in Xiangtan is: "Shoveling up a hundred thousand loads of turf."

    It seems that the local people are using the method of shoveling turf to accumulate fertilizer. However, this is very detrimental to water and soil conservation, and it will also have a great impact on the future development of agricultural production in mountainous areas. Shoveling turf means removing the ground cover from the mountains. In this way, under the impact of torrential rain, not only is the soil washed away, but the fertilizer is also washed away. At the same time, in downstream areas, due to the large amount of sediment carried, the riverbeds rise, causing floods and disasters for agriculture. From the perspective of overall agricultural production, it is not beneficial. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention to this issue when accumulating fertilizer.

    不能忽视水土保持
    4月10日人民日报第八版刊登了湖南的几首新山歌。澧县五白农业社的山歌有这样  两句：“剥光高山的皮”，“洗净岩头的脸”；湘潭韶山社的山歌最后一句是：“铲来草皮十万担”。
    看来，当地群众是用铲草皮的办法来积肥。但是这对水土保持很不利，同时对今后发展山区农业生产有很大影响。铲草皮就是把山上的被复铲掉。这样，在暴雨的冲激下，不但冲走了土，肥料也冲跑了。同时在下游地区，由于携带的泥砂多，河床增高，造成泛滥，给农业带来灾害。从整个农业生产来看，是没有好处的。希望大家积肥时，注意这个问题。
