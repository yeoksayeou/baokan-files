Ode

　　Small horse racks torn down, large brick houses built,
　　Fitted with glass mirrors, walls painted snow-white.
　　"Wells" installed inside, listening to the loudspeakers sing.
　　Dancing on Sundays, no illiteracy in the whole village.
　　Production is in full swing, the village has transformed,
　　When drinking water, think of the source, all thanks to the Communist Party.

This is the people of Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, the first county in the country without illiteracy, singing about their happy lives after the great political, economic, and cultural transformation. (Attached image)

    歌颂
    拆了小马架，盖上大正房，
    嵌上玻璃镜，刷的雪白墙。
    屋里安上“井”，听着喇叭唱。
    星期还跳舞，全村没文盲。
    生产都起劲，变了新村庄，
    饮水要思源，全靠共产党。
    这是全国第一个无盲县——黑龙江省宁安县人民，歌唱他们在政治、经济、文化大翻身以后的幸福生活。（附图片）
