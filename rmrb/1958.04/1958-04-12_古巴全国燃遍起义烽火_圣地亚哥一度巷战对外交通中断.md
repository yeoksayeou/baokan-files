Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Havana: Following the armed uprising against the Batista dictatorship in Havana, the capital of Cuba, on the 9th, armed insurgents engaged in fighting with government troops in Santiago, the second largest city in Cuba and the capital of Oriente Province, on the morning of the 10th.

    Armed insurgents engaged in street battles with fully armed government troops and police patrols on the main streets of Santiago. The fighting ended at noon.

    On the same day, it was reported that fighting between insurgent forces and government troops had occurred throughout Oriente Province. Transportation and traffic between Santiago and most other cities in the province were disrupted. At the same time, strikes broke out in many parts of the province. The Cuban government mobilized more than 10,000 army, navy, and air force personnel to suppress the uprising in the province.

    According to the insurgent forces, they had briefly occupied San Ramon, twenty-five miles southwest of Manzanillo in western Oriente Province, and had also briefly entered the city of Media Luna south of Manzanillo.

    In Camagüey Province, adjacent to Oriente Province, thousands of Cuban workers staged strikes on the 10th, defying the government's order that strikers would be permanently dismissed.

    In addition, it was reported that guerrilla attacks took place in six provinces across Cuba at the same time as the armed revolt in Havana on the 9th. Fighting occurred in areas such as Cotorro in Havana Province, the port of Mariel in Pinar del Río Province, Madruga in Matanzas Province, and Santa Clara.

    In the capital, Havana, government troops and police continued to search and kill those who participated in the armed uprising on the 9th. Order has not yet been restored in the city, and electricity and gas supplies were cut off on the evening of the 9th.

    古巴全国燃遍起义烽火
    圣地亚哥一度巷战对外交通中断
    新华社11日讯　哈瓦那消息：在9日古巴首都哈瓦那发生反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的武装起义以后，10日上午在古巴第二大城市、奥连特省省会圣地亚哥又有武装起义者同政府军队进行战斗。
    武装起义者同全副武装的政府军队和警察的巡逻队在圣地亚哥主要街道上进行巷战。战斗到中午才结束。
    同一天，据报道，在奥连特省全省各地都发生了起义部队同政府军的战斗。圣地亚哥同这个省其他大多数城市之间的运输和交通都中断了。同时全省许多地方都发生罢工。古巴政府调集了一万人以上的陆、海、空军人员到这个省来进行镇压。
    据起义部队宣布，他们曾一度攻占奥连特省西部曼萨尼罗西南二十五英里的圣拉蒙，还曾一度进入曼萨尼罗以南的梅迪阿路纳城。
    在邻近奥连特省的卡马圭省，成千名古巴职工不顾政府关于罢工者将被永久开除的命令，在10日举行了罢工。
    此外，据报道，在9日哈瓦那发生武装暴动的同时，在古巴全国六个省份中都有游击队进行袭击的事件。在哈瓦那省的科托罗、比那尔·德里奥省的马里耳港口、马坦萨斯省的马德鲁加和圣克拉拉等地都发生了战斗。
    在首都哈瓦那，政府军和警察10日继续大肆搜查和枪杀9日参加武装起义的人。这个城市的秩序还没有恢复，9日晚间电力和煤气供应都告中断。
