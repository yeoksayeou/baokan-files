Title: When Subordinates' Opinions Are Wrong

In a certain unit, many of the big-character posters criticized the leaders of the unit for disliking to listen to different opinions from their subordinates. In this unit, the following situation often occurred: whoever put forward an opinion that conformed to the leader's intention, the leader nodded repeatedly; conversely, before the person could finish speaking, he would be rebuffed, resulting either in an unpleasant ending or making comrades unwilling to express their different opinions. After seeing these big-character posters, this leader was very distressed and felt wronged, saying, "I certainly did not want comrades to follow my wishes and watch my face when speaking. Have comrades forgotten that in meetings, I always encouraged comrades to say whatever they had to say, and any different opinions could be expressed. I did interrupt comrades when they were speaking, but this was only for some wrong opinions..."

The problem lies here. First, are the opinions that the leader considers wrong really wrong? Or are they entirely wrong? Second, even if some opinions are wrong, what attitude should the leader adopt?

It can be said that, under normal circumstances, leaders are more likely to discover wrong opinions because they have a comprehensive understanding of the situation and are familiar with the Party's policies and guidelines; however, there are also cases where leaders' understanding of the situation is not comprehensive and their study of the Party's policies and guidelines is insufficient, making it difficult to distinguish between correct and wrong opinions, and even treating correct opinions as wrong opinions. During this rectification campaign, many such leaders have been exposed.

If a subordinate's opinion is indeed wrong, the leader should still adopt an attitude of listening patiently. After the other party has finished speaking, then express one's own opinion. If necessary, one should express one's own opinion a little later. This is because, whether it is between superiors and subordinates or among ordinary comrades, everyone initially believes that their own opinion is correct and the other person's opinion is wrong. If the leader interrupts and cuts off the subordinate as soon as he feels that the subordinate's opinion is wrong, or even does not allow him to continue speaking, this will not make the other party truly realize that his opinion is wrong. On the contrary, he will think that the leader's opinion is wrong.

Can wrong opinions be treated like small pebbles encountered by the feet, kicked aside without concern, and then one walks away? No, they still have value in listening. As long as the leader listens patiently and enthusiastically, and discusses and analyzes with them, even if the opinion itself has nothing to commend, one can still gain a lot from other aspects. This is like a teacher: if he only marks students' answers with ××, then neither he nor the students will gain anything from it; if he can work with the student to find out the reason for the mistake, then he will not only help the student, but he can also further understand the student's comprehension ability, problems in learning, and shortcomings in teaching.

Patiently listening to subordinates' different opinions, even wrong opinions, is a prerequisite for a leader. The reason why a few leaders cannot listen to their subordinates' different opinions is because these leaders still have some incorrect ideas in their minds. One can imagine, when hearing opinions different from their own from colleagues or superiors, do these leaders immediately judge others to be wrong and themselves to be right, or even refuse to listen to others' speeches at all? If this is not the case, then this attitude towards subordinates is not only a dislike of listening to different opinions, but also contains not treating subordinates with an equal attitude. They only acknowledge that superiors and colleagues may be more correct than themselves, but do not acknowledge that subordinates may also be more correct than themselves; they are only willing to argue with superiors or colleagues, but disdain to argue with subordinates.

Thus, it is not only required that leaders not be arrogant in front of their subordinates, but also that they patiently listen to the various opinions of their subordinates. The leader mentioned earlier is precisely lacking this kind of thinking or habit of respecting subordinates.

    当下级的意见错误的时候
    张帆
    某单位贴出的大字报中，有不少是批评这个单位的领导者不喜欢听取下级同志不同的意见的。在这个单位里，常常出现这样的情况：谁提出的意见符合领导者的意图时，领导者就点头不止，反之，则没等人把话说完，就顶了回去，这样，不是弄得不欢而散，就是弄得同志们不愿意再说出自己的不同的意见。这位领导者看到这些大字报以后，很为苦恼，并且感到委屈的说：“我决没有要同志们顺着我的意思、看着我的脸色说话。同志们难道忘了，开会时，我总是动员同志们有什么说什么，任何不同的意见都可以说出来。同志们说话时，我也真插了话，但这只是对一些错误的意见。……”
    问题也就发生在这里，第一，领导者所认为错误的意见，是不是真的错误呢？或者是不是全部错误呢？第二，即使有些意见是错误的，领导者应当采取什么态度呢？
    可以这样说，在通常情况下，领导者因为了解情况全面，熟悉党的方针、政策，比较容易发现错误的意见；但是也有这样情况，领导者对情况的了解不全面，对党的方针、政策研究得不够，就不很容易分清正确意见和错误意见，也曾经把正确意见当作了错误意见。在这次整风中，已经揭露了不少这样的领导者。
    下级同志的意见的确是错误的，领导者还是应该采取耐心听下去的态度，等对方把话说完后，再说出自己的意见，必要时，还应慢一点说出自己的意见。这因为不论是上下级或是一般同志之间，一开始，都会认为自己的意见是正确的，别人的意见是错误的。如果领导者一感到下级同志的意见错误，就插话打断，甚至不许说下去，这样做，并不能使对方真正认识到自己的意见是错误的，相反的，还会认为领导者的意见倒是错误的。
    错误的意见，是不是可以像脚边碰到的小石子一样毫不介意地抬腿踢开扬长而去呢？不是，还是有听取的价值，只要领导者耐心地热情地听下去，并和他们一起讨论、分析，即使意见本身没有什么可取之处，还可以从其他方面得到不少东西。这就像一个教师一样，如果只是对学生的答案打上××，那么，他和学生谁也不会从中得到什么；如果他能同这个学生一起来找出错误的原因，那么，他就不只是帮助了学生，自己也可以从这里更进一步地了解学生的理解能力、学习中的问题、以及教学中的毛病等等。
    耐心地听取下级同志的不同意见以至错误的意见，是领导者必须具备的一个条件。所以少数领导者不能听取下级同志的不同的意见，是因为这些领导者脑子里还有些不正确的东西。可以设想一下，在同级干部或者在上级面前，听到和自己不同的意见的时候，这些领导者是不是也立刻就判定别人是错误的自己是正确的，甚至根本不愿再听别人的发言呢？如果不是这样，那么，对下级同志的这种态度就不仅是不喜欢听取不同的意见，而且还包含着不是以平等的态度来对待下级同志。他们只承认上级和同级干部有比自己正确的时候，而不承认下级同志也可能有比自己正确的时候；只愿意同上级或同级干部争论问题，而不屑同下级干部争论问题。
    这样看来，不只是要求领导者在下级面前不要盛气凌人，而且要求领导者耐心地听取下级同志的各种意见。前面谈到的那位领导者，正是缺少这种尊重下级同志的思想或习惯。
