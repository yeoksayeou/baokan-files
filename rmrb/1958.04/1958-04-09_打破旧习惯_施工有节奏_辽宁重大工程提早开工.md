Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 8th: This spring, in conjunction with the Double-Anti Movement, the basic construction departments in various parts of Liaoning Province have thoroughly broken the old rules of "no construction in March, preparation in April, groundbreaking only in May, and the peak season only in June" and "idleness in the first half of the year, and rushing work in the second half." They have adopted a new measure of rhythmic construction: preparing materials and constructing simultaneously from January to March, and large-scale commencement and construction from April to September. As of early April, many major projects in Liaoning Province have already fully commenced.

While extensively exposing the phenomena of inadequate planning, slow preparation, and work stoppage due to lack of materials in past construction, construction departments in various parts of Liaoning Province have also recently saved a large amount of construction funds and discovered more construction potential by reducing investment, lowering project costs, clearing stockpiled materials, and utilizing old equipment and old materials. According to statistics from six cities including Shenyang, Anshan, Lushun-Dalian, Fushun, Fuxin, and Benxi, the current construction capacity has exceeded this year's construction tasks by more than 30%, thus greatly promoting the Great Leap Forward in basic construction. Under these conditions, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has advanced nine construction projects from next year to this year's construction schedule. The Fourteenth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction, which is undertaking the construction of Liaoning Power Station, originally planned to build for five years, but now proposes to complete all civil engineering within twenty months, and shorten the machine installation time from fourteen months to eight months. The construction period for most projects in the province has been advanced by one month to one year.

Because these major projects will accelerate the construction speed, more than thirty major projects will be put into production in the Liaoning industrial base this year. Therefore, the newly added annual production capacity of various important products will be more than 700,000 tons of steel, more than 700,000 tons of steel products, more than 5 million tons of coal, and 500,000 kilowatts of generator capacity.

    打破旧习惯　施工有节奏
    辽宁重大工程提早开工
    据新华社沈阳8日电　今年春季，辽宁省各地基本建设部门结合双反运动，彻底打破了多年的“3月不开工、4月做准备、5月才破土、6月到旺季”和“上半年窝工、下半年抢工”的老规律，采取了一项有节奏施工的新措施：1月到3月边备料、边施工，4月到9月大开工、大建设。到4月上旬为止，辽宁省的许多大工程已经全面开工。
    辽宁省各地施工部门在大量揭发过去施工中的计划不周、准备迟缓和停工待料等现象的同时，最近还从削减投资、降低工程造价、清理积压物资和利用旧设备、旧材料等方面，节省了大量建设资金，挖掘出了更多的施工潜力。据沈阳、鞍山、旅大、抚顺、阜新、本溪等六个城市统计，现有施工能力已超过今年建设任务30％以上，因此大大促进了基本建设的跃进。在这种条件下，鞍山钢铁公司把下个年度的九个施工项目，都提前到今年施工。承建辽宁电站的建筑工程部十四工程处，原来计划建五年，现在提出二十个月全部完成土建工程，并且把机器安装时间由十四个月缩短到八个月。全省大部分工程的工期都提前了一个月到一年。
    由于这些大工程都要加快建设速度，辽宁工业基地今年将有三十多个大工程投入生产。因此新增加的各种重要产品的年产能力，将有七十多万吨钢、七十多万吨钢材、五百多万吨煤和五十万瓩的发电机容量。
