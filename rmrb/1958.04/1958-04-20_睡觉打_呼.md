    Snoring

    From the knowledge of physics, we know that sound is caused by the vibration of objects.

    In our oral cavity, there is a uvula (colloquially called the little tongue) that does not normally vibrate. When people inhale forcefully, such as forcefully sucking nasal mucus backwards, the uvula vibrates and makes a sound.

    When sleeping, if the nose is clear, the air entering from the nasal cavity cannot move the uvula, so there is no sound; if the nose is blocked and breathing through the mouth, a large stream of air enters and exits the throat, which will cause the uvula to vibrate, thus making a snoring sound. This situation is more common in people with nasal diseases and those who are accustomed to breathing through their mouths.

    Sometimes, if there is nasal mucus in the nasal cavity or phlegm in the throat, then when gas enters and exits, the rolling or vibration of the phlegm will also cause a person to snore.

专栏：为什么

    睡觉打“呼”
    从物理学的知识可以知道，声音是由物体的振动所引起的。
    我们的口腔里，有一个悬雍垂（俗语叫小舌头）平时并不振动，当人们用力吸气的时候，比如用力把鼻腔里的鼻涕往后吸，小舌头振动了，就发出声音来。
    睡觉的时候，如果鼻子畅通，从鼻腔进入的空气打不动悬雍垂，因此没有声音；如果鼻子不通，用口呼吸，大股气流进出于咽喉，这就会使悬雍垂振动起来，因而发出鼾声。这种情况多见于有鼻病以及习惯于用口呼吸的人。
    有时，鼻腔有鼻涕或喉间有痰，那末在气体出入的时候，痰液滚动或振动，也会使人打“呼”。
