    Lenin Participates in Voluntary Labor
    Soviet Union A. Kononov
    In 1920, anyone traveling by train in our country would have seen the "Locomotive Cemetery." That was the nickname people gave to this place where crippled locomotives were piled up. These locomotives, riddled with holes from the fires of civil war, lay scattered in disarray, forming a small mountain.

    It was a difficult period, with the vestiges of war visible everywhere: the remnants of shattered bridges by the river, cities filled with ruins, and railways blocked by paralyzed locomotives.

    The Soviet state had to rebuild its home. And so, a momentous undertaking began: to help their country, the Soviet people used their holidays and spare time after work to participate in voluntary labor. The initiators of voluntary labor were railway workers in Kazakhstan. They volunteered to clean up the "Locomotive Cemetery" and collect intact parts. Following the example of the Kazakh railway workers, railway workers and industrial workers in other regions also began to participate in voluntary labor.

    May 1, 1920, was the All-Russian Voluntary Labor Day. On this day, all over the country, from the Kremlin to remote Siberian worker villages, people participated in labor. Those going to work brought bands with them and marched to the rhythm of the music, as if celebrating a holiday.

    At ten o'clock that morning, the Kremlin fired three volleys of salute. Workers, staff, and students of the Kremlin Military School all gathered in the square.

    When everyone was assembled and ready to march, the commander of the Kremlin guard announced:
    "Today, Comrade Lenin will join us in voluntary labor."

    Lenin quickly stepped to the front.

    Because Lenin was an older man, the political commissar of the military school asked him to stand on the right side of the front row. Lenin immediately took his designated position.

    At this moment, the order was given:
      "Attention!"
    "Right face! Forward, march!"

    Everyone marched to the beat of the music towards the area of the Kremlin where logs, bricks, planks, and garbage were piled up. There were also damaged four-wheeled carts and shell craters on the ground. These were all remnants of the fighting between the October Revolution and the White bandits.

    The task of this voluntary labor was to clean up the Kremlin Square.

    The work began with moving wood. Each log had to be carried by two people, and longer ones required four. Lenin was paired with a soldier. The soldier always tried to give Lenin the thinner end of the log, carrying the larger, heavier end himself. Lenin immediately noticed this and always took the lead.

    At this time, the soldier said:
    "I am only twenty-eight years old, and you are already fifty."

    Lenin put the heavy end of the wood on his shoulder and said with a smile:
    "Since I am older, you should not argue with me."

    After everyone finished moving the wood on the square, they went to move oak logs. People put the logs on wooden poles, and six people carried them. This was quite strenuous work, and even workers accustomed to labor were covered in sweat.

    This time, Lenin was in a group with three sailors and two workers.

    One of the workers looked at Lenin for a long time and finally said: "Vladimir Ilyich, we could manage even if you weren't here. You have more important work to do."

    Lenin replied:
    "At the moment, this work is the most important."

    Because the warm sun was shining brightly, and because Lenin was laboring alongside them, everyone felt that even though the labor was heavy, the holiday passed quickly and happily.

    Everyone wanted to show their skills in front of Lenin; songs and laughter rose and fell. No one wanted to fall behind Lenin.

    During the break, everyone sat down to smoke. But Lenin did not smoke and seemed to have no intention of resting. He kept looking at his watch and then at the remaining logs and the pile of bricks. Later, he walked over to where his comrades were resting and sat down. Someone offered him a cigarette, but he refused, saying that he had started smoking when he was in middle school, but he soon quit and had never smoked since. Everyone wanted to talk with Lenin for a while longer. But he took out his pocket watch again. He had to rush to the Council of People's Commissars today to attend a meeting.

    After the break, everyone began to move bricks and garbage. This time, Lenin worked even harder. But he had to leave a few minutes before the end of the voluntary labor because the People's Committee was waiting for him to attend a meeting.

    The work was quickly finished. People felt tired, but in a cheerful mood when parting. Everyone realized that they had indeed done an important job today, and next Saturday's voluntary labor day would have new tens of thousands of Soviet people participating in voluntary labor, because Lenin had set an example for them.

    列宁参加义务劳动
    苏联　阿·科诺诺夫
    1920年在我国乘火车旅行的人都看见过“机车公墓”。那是当时人们给这堆放断臂残肢的机车的地方送的绰号。这些在内战炮火中被打得百孔千疮的机车，一个个横躺竖卧，在那里堆积成一座小山，显得十分零乱。
    这是一个艰苦的时期，战争的遗迹触目皆是：河边上残留着炸断了的桥梁，城市里一片断垣残壁，铁路上停着瘫痪了的机车。
    苏维埃国家必须重建自己的家园。于是一场惊天动地的事业开始了：为了帮助自己的国家，苏联人民利用休假日和平日的工余时间参加义务劳动。义务劳动的发起者是哈萨克的铁路工人。他们自告奋勇清理“机车公墓”，收集完整的零件。仿效哈萨克铁路工人的榜样，其他地区的铁路工人和产业工人也开始参加义务劳动了。
    1920年5月1日是全俄罗斯义务劳动日。这一天，全国各地，从克里姆林宫到边远的西伯利亚的工人村，人们都参加了劳动。前去劳动的人们带着乐队，随着音乐的节奏，踏着整齐的步伐，简直像庆祝节日一样。
    这天早晨十点钟，克里姆林宫连鸣了三声礼炮。工人、职员和克里姆林宫军事学校的学员一齐走上广场。
    当大家集合完毕，准备整队出发时，克里姆林宫守卫队司令宣布：
    “今天，列宁同志和我们一道参加义务劳动。”
    列宁迅速地走到前头。
    由于列宁是一个年长的人，军事学校的政治委员请他站在队首的右侧。列宁立刻站到指定的位置。
    这时发出了口令：
      “立正！”
    “右转弯齐步走！”
    大家踏着音乐的拍子，向克里姆林宫堆放圆木、砖头、木板和垃圾的地方走去。这个地方还放着破损的四轮车，地上可以看到炮弹坑。这些都是十月革命同白匪作战时残留下来的。
    这次义务劳动的任务是，把克里姆林宫广场清理干净。
    工作先从搬运木头开始，每根木头要由两个人抬，遇到太长的就要用四个人。列宁和一个军人配成一组。军人总是极力把木头细的一端让给列宁，自己抬大的、比较重的一端。列宁立刻发现了这种情况，就每次都抢在头里。
    这时军人说：
    “我才二十八岁，您已经五十岁了。”
    列宁把木头重的一端放到肩上后，笑着说：
    “既然我年纪大，您就不要跟我争论了。”
    大家把广场的木头搬完了后就去搬橡树圆木。人们把圆木放在木棍上，六个人抬着。这是相当累人的工作，连惯常劳动的工人也都汗流满面。
    这一次，跟列宁在一组工作的有三个水兵、两个工人。
    其中一个工人望着列宁，半天终于说话了：“弗拉基米尔·伊里奇，您就是不来，我们也干得了。您有比这更重要的工作。”
    列宁回答说：
    “目前，这个工作就是最重要的”。
    由于暖烘烘的太阳当头高照，由于列宁在身边劳动，人人都觉得：今天的劳动虽然沉重，但是节日却过得很快活。
    每个人都想在列宁面前显显身手；歌声和谈笑声此起彼伏。谁也不甘落在列宁的后面。
    休息时候，大家坐下来抽烟。可是列宁没有抽烟，看来连休息的意思也没有。他一会看看表，一会看看剩下的圆木和那堆砖。后来他走到同志们休息的地方坐下了。有人递给他一支香烟，他拒绝了说，他本来在中学读书时就开始抽烟，不过不久就戒掉了，以后再也没抽过烟。大家都愿意和列宁多谈一会。但他又掏出怀表。他今天还要赶到苏联人民委员会去参加一个会议。
    休息以后，大家开始搬运砖头和垃圾。这次列宁更加卖力了。但他不得不在义务劳动结束的前几分钟离开，因为人民委员会等着他开会。
    工作很快就结束了。人们感到疲乏，但是在分手时心情很舒畅。大家都意识到：今天他们确实做了一件重要的工作，下一个星期六义务劳动日将有新的成千上万的苏联人参加义务劳动，因为列宁给他们树立了榜样。
