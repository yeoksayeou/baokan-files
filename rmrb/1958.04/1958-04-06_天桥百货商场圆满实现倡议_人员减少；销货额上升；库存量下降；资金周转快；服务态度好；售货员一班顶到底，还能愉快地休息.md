    Tianqiao Department Store Successfully Implements Initiative
    Reduced Staff; Increased Sales; Reduced Inventory; Faster Capital Turnover; Better Service Attitude; Sales Clerks Work One Shift to the End, and Can Still Rest Happily
    (Our report) Beijing—The revolutionary initiative to improve commercial work at the Tianqiao Department Store has been successfully implemented. Good service attitude and high service quality are the most significant changes in this store. One hundred percent of the salespersons have received praise from customers, with more than 1,600 pieces of praise received in March alone.
    Although the employees of Tianqiao Department Store have implemented a work system of working one shift from 9:00 am to 8:30 pm, it has not excessively affected the employees' rest. Their method is to adjust the positions of goods, grouping the nine teams in the entire store into three mutual aid groups. When busy, everyone works together; when not busy, some people go off duty to rest. All goods that can be sold openly are sold openly, allowing customers to choose goods from the shelves at will, and salespersons can also serve several customers at the same time, reducing the labor intensity of repeatedly fetching goods for customers. After implementing the decentralization of authority for purchasing, sales, and inventory to the sales teams, 50% of the teams canceled the daily detailed ledger and switched to monthly inventory, so that after closing the business every day, salespersons no longer spend a lot of time checking goods, matching documents, and bookkeeping.
    In terms of reducing commodity inventory and saving funds, the main measures of Tianqiao Department Store are frequent purchases and rapid sales, delegating all authority for purchasing, sales, and inventory to the sales teams. The employees of each sales team, based on the commodities they manage, checked past operating data according to the season and the purchasing patterns of the masses, and analyzed which are essential goods, how much to purchase at one time, how long the turnover period needs to be, etc., and accordingly drafted a list of essential commodities, expanded the variety of goods, the quantity of purchases, reasonable inventory, and seasonal commodity locations. The employees also actively exchanged goods with fraternal stores, entrusted sales on consignment, set up stalls, and processed and modified goods, selling many slow-moving commodities. As a result, the number of commodity varieties increased from more than 5,000 to more than 6,000, and sales increased. Due to the decrease in inventory, a large warehouse in the mall has been turned into a meeting place, and five small warehouses have also been vacated. The funds used have been reduced from the original 320,000 yuan to more than 170,000 yuan, and in addition there is 13,000 yuan of sewing machines and bicycles added to meet customer needs.
    The key to ensuring the successful implementation of the various initiatives is that the Party organization and the trade union of this mall have firmly grasped the political and ideological education work, and fully mobilized the masses to carry out whatever they do. Therefore, all employees have maintained high political enthusiasm.
    Now the employees of this mall have put forward higher goals and have started systematic business studies, moving towards the goal of becoming all-round salespersons. (Zhao Jialie, Lei Runming)

    天桥百货商场圆满实现倡议
    人员减少；销货额上升；库存量下降；资金周转快；服务态度好；售货员一班顶到底，还能愉快地休息
    本报讯　北京天桥百货商场改进商业工作的革命倡议已圆满实现。服务态度好，服务质量高，是这个商店最显著的变化。售货员百分之百的受到了顾客的表扬，仅3月份内就收到顾客的表扬意见一千六百多条。
    天桥商场的职工虽然实行了从早九时到晚八时半一班顶的工作制，但并没有过分影响职工的休息。他们的办法是调整货位，把全场九个小组组成三个互助组，忙时一齐上班，不忙时一部分人下柜休息；凡是能敞开销售的货品，都一律敞开销售，使顾客能随意从货架上挑选货品，售货员也能同时接待几个顾客，减轻了来回给顾客取货的劳动强度；实行了进货、销货、存货的权力下放到售货小组以后，有50％的小组取销了每日记明细账，改成月终盘点，使每天停止营业以后，售货员不再花很多时间去查货、对单据和记账了。
    在压缩商品库存、节省资金方面，天桥百货商场的主要措施是勤进、快销，把进货、销货、存货的权力全部交给售货小组。各售货小组的职工又把自己掌握的商品，根据季节和群众购买规律，查对过去的经营资料，分析出了哪些是必备品、一次进货多少、周转期需要多长等等，依此拟出必备商品目录、扩大经营的品种、进货数量、合理库存和旺季商品货位等。职工们还积极与兄弟商店交换商品、互托代销、摆摊、以及加工改制，把许多滞背商品销售了出去。这样作的结果，商品种类由原来的五千多种增加到六千多种，销货额上升。由于库存量下降，商场里的一个大仓库已经变成了会场，五个小仓库也空了出来，所用资金由原来的三十二万元减少为十七万多元，而且在这里面还有针对顾客需要增添的价值一万三千多元的缝纫机和自行车。
    保证各项倡议条件圆满实现的关键，是这个商场的党组织和工会紧紧地抓住了政治思想教育工作，无论作什么都充分发动群众来进行。因此，全体职工一直保持着高涨的政治热情。
    现在这个商场的职工又提出了更高的奋斗目标，同时开始了系统的业务学习，向全能售货员的目标前进。　（赵家烈、雷润明）
