    Is it Quantitative Change or Qualitative Change?
    Wu Xu
    The whole country is in the Great Leap Forward, and the face of many places has completely changed. The Daquan Mountain in Shanxi, the Manghe area in Henan, the low-lying areas of Tianjin... up to the recent merger of townships and communes in Minhou, Fujian, such examples are too numerous to mention. Some people ask, is this a qualitative change or a quantitative change? It is a quantitative change; it can also be said to be a qualitative change. This change of balance and imbalance is the qualitative change of many parts in the overall process of quantitative change. In the future, when China changes from an agricultural country to an industrial country, then a leap will be completed, and then the process of quantitative change will continue.
    But many of the current changes are partial qualitative changes in the process of quantitative change. It can be said that for the part that has undergone a complete change in appearance, that kind of change is a qualitative change, but for the whole of China, it is still a quantitative change. Quantitative change and qualitative change are originally not mutually isolated opposites, but should be examined in mutual connection. Quantitative change is a process, a process of change from this quality to that quality, a qualitative change part by part. The transition from the democratic revolution to the socialist revolution did not happen overnight. In the process of the democratic revolution, some parts were already undergoing changes of a socialist revolutionary nature. Many socialist revolutionary measures today are the great promotion and development of some revolutionary measures in our democratic revolution period. For example, big-character posters were accidental at that time, but today they have become inevitable. The inevitability of today had its sprouts in the accident of that time.

    是量变还是质变
    伍胥
    全国在大跃进，许多地方的面貌完全改变了。山西的大泉山、河南的漭河地区、天津的低洼地区……一直到最近福建闽侯的联乡并社，这种事例已举不胜举。有人问，这是质变还是量变？是量变；也可说是质变。这种平衡和不平衡的变化，是总的量变过程中许多部分的质变。将来中国由农业国变成工业国，那时候将完成一个飞跃，然后再继续量变的过程。
    但是目前的许多变化又是量变过程中的部分质变。可以这样说；在有了面貌完全改观的变化的那个部分说来，那样的改变是质变，就整个中国说来，那还是量变。量变和质变原来就不是彼此孤立着的对立物，而是要在相互联系中去考察的。量变是一个过程，是这个质向那个质变去的过程，是一部分一部分的质变。从民主革命变到社会主义革命，并不是在一夜之间变过来的，在民主革命的过程中，就已有一些部分在起着社会主义革命性质的变化，目前有许多社会主义革命措施就是我们在民主革命时期的一些革命措施的发扬光大。如大字报，在那时是偶然，到今天就已成了必然。今天的必然在那时的偶然中就有了它的萌芽。
