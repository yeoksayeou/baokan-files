　　“Fearing the wind and rain will destroy the flowers, I chase the butterflies in the sunny light; half the spring is lost in drunken nights, yet tomorrow we call it the Flower Festival.”
　　　　　　　　　　——Tang Xianzu

　　The 15th day of the second lunar month is the "Flower Festival." It is said that this festival took shape in the Tang Dynasty. People often compare it with the "Mid-Autumn Festival" on August 15th, calling them "Flower Morning and Moonlit Evening," because both festivals fall in the middle of spring and autumn. However, in some places, the Flower Festival is not on February 15th. Generally, in the Yellow River basin, Shanxi and Henan celebrate it on February 2nd, while Jiangsu and Zhejiang celebrate it on February 12th. Those celebrating on February 15th include Hebei, Shandong, and Shaanxi in the Yellow River basin, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as coastal Guangdong and Fujian.

　　In February, the spring breeze turns the earth green, and all kinds of flowers begin to bloom. People love the warmth of spring and the charming fragrance of flowers, hoping to preserve youth. Therefore, they imagine that flowers also have their own festival, calling the "Flower Festival" the birthday of all flowers. In the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, people also tie green and red threads around flower trees on this day, wishing for the prosperity of all flowers.

　　The Flower Festival was originally a festival related to women. In feudal society, women's activities could not go beyond the scope of the family, so there is not much rich activity data for people to study. For example, the "Butterfly Catching Meeting" now makes it impossible to know its content and form. Only the custom of "piercing ears for young girls" is still known to many people. According to legend, piercing ears on the Flower Festival, with the protection of the flower god, will prevent the earlobes from festering.

　　Since February is long into spring, people south of the Huai River have entered a busy planting season. In the process of production, people have accumulated experience and created proverbs related to production. For example, "A bright moon on the Flower Festival, a bountiful cotton harvest"; "A sunny Flower Festival, all things will ripen"... Although there is no scientific basis, it encourages people to seize sunny days to sow quickly and ensure a good harvest.

　　Today, women are the masters, no longer suffering the torment of ear piercing. They are working diligently in household labor and on the production front. Now, in the warm and flowery Flower Festival, we can hear their soaring songs everywhere. Their tragic fate has vanished with the old society.

    花朝
    仇文农
    “妒花风雨怕难销，偶逐晴光扑蝶遥；一半春随残夜醉，却言明日是花朝。”
                         ——汤显祖
    农历2月15日是“花朝节”，据传这个节日在唐代已经形成。人们常把它与八月十五的“中秋”相提并举，称为“花朝月夕”，因为这两个节日都恰在春秋两季的中间。但是也有些地方的花朝节，不是在2月15日。大抵黄河流域的山西河南以2月2日为花朝，江苏浙江以2月12日为花朝；以2月15日为花朝的，有黄河流域的河北、山东、陕西，长江下游流域的江西、湖北、湖南以及滨海的广东福建等地。
    2月，春风吹绿了大地，百花开始争芳斗艳，人们爱春气和煦，更爱百花妩媚芬芳，希望青春长驻，因而想像花也有它的节日，便称“花朝节”为百花生日，江浙一带人们在这一天还以绿红遍系花树，祝百花繁盛。
    花朝本来是一个与妇女有关的节日，在封建社会，妇女的活动不能越出家庭的范围，所以也就没有甚么丰富的活动资料可以供人们研究。如“扑蝶会”现在就不可能知道它的内容和形式。只有“幼女穿耳”这一习俗许多人还知道。据传说，在花朝日穿耳，有花神的保护，耳珠不致溃烂。
    由于2月入春已久，淮河以南人们已进入繁忙的播种时候。在生产过程中，人们积累了经验，也创造了与生产有关的谚语。如“花朝月明，棉花十分”；“花朝日晴，则万物成熟”……虽说没有科学的根据，但它鼓励人民抓晴天赶快下种，保证丰收。
    今天，妇女当了主人，不再受穿耳的折磨，她们正在家务劳动中和生产战线上勤奋地工作着。现在当春暖花开的花朝节，我们到处可以听到她们高歌猛进的歌声，悲惨命运已随着旧社会一去不返了。
