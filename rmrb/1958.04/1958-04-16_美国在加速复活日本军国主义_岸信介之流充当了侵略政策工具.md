Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 15th: With the active promotion of the United States and Japan, some countries that participated in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East brazenly decided unilaterally on April 7th to approve the complete release of ten Japanese Class A war criminals, including Araki Sadao, to accelerate the revival of Japanese militarist forces.

The Living Class A War Criminals Have All Been Released
These ten Class A war criminals were originally sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. By 1956, they had been "paroled" by the United States and Japan without authorization. Now, all the surviving war criminals among the twenty-eight Japanese Class A war criminals who were sentenced after World War II have been formally released.

The countries that unilaterally decided to release the Japanese Class A war criminals at the request of the Japanese government were the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Australia, among other eight countries that had unilaterally concluded the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" with Japan. In addition, there was the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which had long been spurned by the Chinese people.

This unilateral decision by the United States did not solicit the opinions of the Soviet Union, India, and China, which participated in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. This illegal act violated the agreement among the Allied Powers during World War II on establishing an international military tribunal and the solemn judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in punishing Japanese war criminals. At the same time, it also seriously damaged the basic rights and interests of the people of China and other countries that suffered from Japanese militarist aggression in order to prevent the revival of Japanese aggression. Even the United States government cannot help but feel guilty because it cannot justify it to the American people. The U.S. State Department issued the announcement of the complete release of Japanese Class A war criminals in Tokyo and fourteen hours later released the announcement in Washington. According to U.S. officials "privately", the U.S. State Department did so because it was "afraid of causing adverse political reactions at home."

Since the end of World War II, the United States has consistently condoned and shielded Japanese war criminals. The United States does this to select among them stubborn militarists to act as its lackeys in the Far East. The current Japanese Prime Minister, Shinsuke Kishi, is this kind of character favored by the United States. Kishi Nobusuke served as the "Vice Minister of Industry", "Vice Minister of Industry", and "Vice Minister of the General Affairs Agency" of the puppet state of Manchuria, implementing the so-called "Manchurian Industrial Development Five-Year Plan" to plunder the resources and wealth of Northeast China, which played a role in promoting the Japanese war of aggression against China and turning Northeast China into an anti-Soviet base. In 1941, he served as the Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Tojo Cabinet, directing the so-called "wartime economy" policy for the Japanese war of aggression. After Japan's surrender, he was arrested for the crimes of a Class A war criminal, but was arbitrarily released by the United States in December 1948. Since then, Kishi Nobusuke has colluded with the United States and became the Prime Minister of Japan in February 1957. After taking office, Kishi Nobusuke actively worked to release Japanese war criminals and win over those with similar tastes to strengthen the militarist ruling forces. It has been revealed that the Japanese government's request for the formal release of Class A war criminals this time is to enable them to resume "public office." Some Class A war criminals have expressed their desire to represent the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in the upcoming general election to run for members of the National Assembly.

Since taking office, Kishi Nobusuke has actively followed the U.S.'s war preparation and aggressive policies and is particularly hostile to the Chinese people. While playing the "two Chinas" conspiracy, he went to Taiwan last year to express his support to the Chiang Kai-shek clique for its "counterattack against the mainland." Currently, Kishi Nobusuke is also undermining the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

The U.S. Atomic Strategy System Includes Japan
Kishi Nobusuke took a series of military expansion plans to Washington in June of last year to ask Eisenhower for instructions. The basic principle of these plans is that Japan "should base itself on a security system with the United States" to deal with "external aggression." The ambition of the remnants of Japanese militarism to take the opportunity to rise again with the support of the United States is evident. According to these plans, by 1960, Japan will increase its army to 180,000, its navy to 124,000 tons, and its air force to 1,300 aircraft. These goals are being accelerated. In the army alone, this year it will be expanded from the existing 160,000 to 170,000. According to the results of the Eisenhower-Kishi talks, a "Japan-U.S. Security Committee" was also established in Tokyo to plan Japan's rearmament.

Recently, the Japanese government has been stepping up efforts to turn Japan into a U.S. atomic warfare base in the Far East, incorporating Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system. U.S. B-47 bombers carrying atomic bombs are patrolling the skies over Japan. U.S. "Honest John" rockets have been deployed on Japanese soil. The U.S. Seventh Fleet, which operates in the Far East, is also equipped with nuclear weapons. The United States is also building missile bases on Okinawa. Kishi Nobusuke publicly defended the United States at the House of Representatives Cabinet Committee on March 28, saying that according to the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty", the United States has the right to transport nuclear weapons into Japan.

At the same time, the Japanese army itself is also stepping up preparations to arm itself with nuclear weapons. The United States has decided to supply Japan with "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles. Japan has also requested the United States to supply six other types of missiles, "Honest John" rockets, and jet aircraft that can be equipped with missiles and rockets. The Japanese "Defense Agency" and the military industry are also actively planning to produce rockets and missiles. According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese "Defense Agency" is drafting a second five-year plan for military expansion (1961-1965), preparing to equip the Japanese army with nuclear weapons.

In order to remove obstacles to Japan's large-scale rearmament, the Japanese government is stepping up preparations to revise the constitution that prohibits Japan from possessing war forces. A so-called "Constitution Investigation Committee" was formally established on August 13 last year. On the other hand, seeing the great resistance to amending the constitution, Kishi Nobusuke had long planned to use the method of distorting the interpretation of the constitution to make it exist in name only. Kishi Nobusuke told the Diet as early as May 7 last year that if it is within the scope of "self-defense", Japan's possession of atomic weapons "does not violate the constitution." According to Kyodo News Agency recently, the Japanese government is studying whether sending Japanese troops abroad to "assist in maintaining international peace" violates the constitution. Kyodo News Agency said that the Japanese government "is increasingly inclined to believe that sending troops abroad does not violate the constitution." A series of rearmament activities by the Japanese government are being carried out under the guise of "self-defense", but more and more facts show that the driving force behind promoting Japan's rearmament is the latent imperialist aggressive ambitions of the remnants of Japanese militarism under the support of the United States.

Kishi Nobusuke and His Ilk Spread Poison to the People
Kishi Nobusuke and his ilk, who are painstakingly trying to turn Japan into a hotbed of militarism, are also making every effort to re-disseminate militarist poison to the Japanese people. The Liberal Democratic Party has submitted a bill to the Diet to restore February 11 as "Kigen-setsu". It is said that February 11 is the anniversary of the enthronement of Emperor Jimmu, the first emperor of Japan. Before the war, this day was designated as "Kigen-setsu" to promote the emperor system as the pillar of militarism. In addition, the Japanese Ministry of Education has also announced that it will add so-called "moral education" courses in schools across the country to restore militarist education. At the same time, it is also necessary to implement a so-called "performance appraisal system" of "performance evaluation" for teachers and staff to strengthen the control and persecution of teachers and staff. With the connivance of the Japanese government, a large number of books, movies, and records that promote militarism have reappeared in Japan.

The Japanese People's Voice of Defending Peace is Unprecedentedly Loud
However, the Japanese people, who have suffered deeply from Japanese militarism, have greatly increased their awareness after the war. The call to defend peace and oppose the revival of militarism is unprecedentedly loud. In Japan, the struggle against the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" system, against turning Japan into a nuclear weapons base, against amending the constitution, and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Japan for peace, independence, and democracy has become a national movement. Both the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party advocate declaring Japan and Asia as nuclear-weapon-free zones. The Japanese working class also strongly supported the struggle launched by 500,000 teachers and staff nationwide against the implementation of militarist education in the recent spring struggle.

The people of the Far East countries suffered serious damage from the Japanese militarist aggression during World War II, and the Chinese people suffered particularly severely. However, the Japanese government has not yet accounted for the responsibility that Japan should bear in the past war of aggression. On the contrary, with the support of the United States, the Kishi Nobusuke government is actively reviving militarist forces, attempting to take the opportunity to make a comeback, which cannot but arouse the serious vigilance and indignation of the Chinese people and the people of other Far East countries.

### 美国在加速复活日本军国主义  岸信介之流充当了侵略政策工具

    美国在加速复活日本军国主义
    岸信介之流充当了侵略政策工具
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：经过美国和日本的积极活动，参加远东国际军事法庭的一部分国家，公然在4月7日片面决定批准完全释放荒木贞夫等十名日本甲级战犯，以加速复活日本军国主义势力。
    活着的甲级战犯已全部出笼
    这十名甲级战犯原来都是被远东国际军事法庭判处无期徒刑的。他们到1956年已经先后被美国和日本擅自“假释”在外。现在，这些在第二次世界大战以后被判刑的二十八名日本甲级战犯中还活着的战犯，就此全部正式被放出笼。
    应日本政府的要求片面决定释放日本甲级战犯的，是美国、英国、法国和澳大利亚等曾经和日本片面缔结旧金山“和约”的八个国家。此外，还有早已被中国人民唾弃的蒋介石集团。
    美国这一片面决定，并没有征求参加远东国际军事法庭的苏联、印度和中国的意见。这种非法的行为，破坏了第二次世界大战中同盟国关于设立国际军事法庭的协议和远东国际军事法庭惩治日本战犯的庄严判决，同时，也严重损害了中国和其他遭受日本军国主义侵略的国家的人民，为了防止日本侵略势力复活而制裁日本战犯的基本权利和利益。即使是美国政府，也不能不因为无法向美国人民交代而感到做贼心虚。美国国务院是在东京发表了全部释放日本甲级战犯的公报以后十四个小时才在华盛顿发表公告。据美国官方人士“私下”的解释，美国国务院这样做，是因为“恐怕在国内引起不利的政治反应”。
    从第二次世界大战结束以来，美国一贯极力纵容和包庇日本战犯。美国这样做是为了挑选其中顽固不化的军国主义分子，充当它在远东的鹰犬。现任日本首相岸信介就是美国所垂青的这种角色。岸信介曾经担任伪满洲国“实业部次长”、“产业部次长”、“总务厅次长”等要职，实行掠夺中国东北资源和财富的所谓“满洲产业开发五年计划”，对日本侵华战争和变中国东北为反苏基地，起了推动的作用。他在1941年担任东条内阁商工相，指导进行日本侵略战争的所谓“战时经济”政策。日本投降后，他曾因犯有甲级战犯的罪行被捕，但在1948年12月被美国擅自释放。从此，岸信介就和美国勾结上了，并且在1957年2月出任日本首相。岸信介上台以后就积极为释放日本战犯而活动，并且拉拢其中臭味相投的人加强军国主义统治势力。有消息透露，日本政府这次提出正式释放甲级战犯的要求，是为了使他们重新担任“公职”。有些甲级战犯已经表示希望代表执政的自由民主党在未来的大选中参加国会议员的竞选。
    岸信介上台以来，积极追随美国的备战侵略政策。并且特别敌视中国人民。他在耍弄“两个中国”的阴谋的同时，曾经在去年到台湾去向蒋介石集团表示支持它“反攻大陆”。目前，岸信介又在破坏第四次中日贸易协定。
    美国原子战略体系包括了日本
    岸信介在去年6月曾经携带了一系列的扩军计划到华盛顿去向艾森豪威尔请示。这些计划的基本方针是：日本“要以同美国在一起的安全体系为基础”，对付“外来的侵略”。日本军国主义残余势力妄图借助美国的支持东山再起的野心，由此可见。根据这些计划，日本到1960年度将把陆军增加到十八万人，海军舰只增加到十二万四千吨，空军增加到拥有飞机一千三百架。这些目标正在加快实现中。仅是陆军方面，今年度就要从现有的十六万人扩充到十七万人。根据艾森豪威尔和岸信介会谈的结果，在东京还设立了“日美安全委员会”，策划日本重整军备的工作。
    最近以来，日本政府正在加紧使日本变成美国在远东的原子战争基地，把日本纳入美国的原子战略体系。在日本的上空有携带着原子弹的美国B—47型轰炸机在巡逻。在日本的土地上已经安置了美国的“诚实的约翰”式火箭。活动在远东海面的美国第七舰队也配备有核武器。美国还在冲绳岛建立导弹基地。岸信介3月28日在众议院内阁委员会上公开为美国辩护说，根据日美“安全条约”，美国有权把核武器运进日本。
    同时，日本军队本身也在加紧准备武装核武器。美国已经决定供给日本“响尾蛇”式空空导弹。日本还要求美国供给其他六种类型的导弹、“诚实的约翰”式火箭以及可以装备导弹和火箭的喷气式飞机。日本“防卫厅”和军需工业也在积极筹划生产火箭和导弹。据日本报纸报道，日本“防卫厅”正在拟订扩充军备的第二个五年计划（1961年度到1965年度），准备用核武器装备日本军队。
    为了扫除日本大规模重整军备的障碍，日本政府正在加紧准备修改禁止日本拥有战争力量的宪法。一个所谓“宪法调查会”已经在去年8月13日正式成立。另一方面，看到修改宪法的阻力很大，岸信介早已打算用歪曲解释宪法的手法使它名存实亡。岸信介早在去年5月7日向国会说过，如果在“自卫”的范围内，日本拥有原子武器并“不违反宪法”。另据共同社最近透露，日本政府正在研究派日本军队出国“协助维持国际和平”是否违反宪法的问题。共同社说，日本政府“愈来愈倾向于认为派兵出国并不违反宪法”。日本政府的一系列的重整军备的活动都是在为了“自卫”的幌子下进行的，但是，愈来愈多的事实说明，促进日本重整军备的动力是美国扶植下的日本军国主义残余分子潜在的帝国主义侵略野心。
    岸信介之流向老百姓散布毒素
    处心积虑要把日本变成军国主义温床的岸信介之流，还在竭力重新向日本老百姓散布军国主义毒素。自由民主党已经向国会提出把2月11日恢复为“纪元节”的议案。据说2月11日是日本第一个天皇神武天皇登基的纪念日。战前曾经规定这一天为“纪元节”，用来鼓吹作为军国主义支柱的天皇制。此外，日本政府文部省还宣布要在全国各地的学校增设所谓“道德教育”的课程，来恢复军国主义教育。同时，还要对教职员实行所谓“勤务评定”的“考绩制度”，加紧对教职员的控制和迫害。在日本政府的纵容之下，大批宣传军国主义的书刊、电影和唱片等又在日本出现。
    日本人民保卫和平呼声空前响亮
    但是，曾经身受日本军国主义祸害的日本人民，在战后觉悟大大提高。保卫和平、反对军国主义复活的呼声空前响亮。在日本，反对旧金山“和约”体制、反对变日本为核武器基地、反对修改宪法、要求美军撤出日本的争取和平、独立、民主的斗争，已经成为全民性的运动。日本共产党和社会党都主张宣布日本和亚洲为无原子武器区。日本工人阶级在最近举行的春季斗争中，也有力地支援了全国五十万教职员展开的反对推行军国主义教育的斗争。
    远东各国人民在第二次世界大战中曾经遭受日本军国主义侵略的严重损害，中国人民遭受的损害尤其严重。但是，日本政府到现在一直没有对日本在过去的侵略战争中应负的责任作出交代。相反地，在美国的支持下，岸信介政府积极复活军国主义势力，妄图伺机卷土重来，这就不能不引起中国人民和其他远东国家人民的严重警惕和愤慨。
