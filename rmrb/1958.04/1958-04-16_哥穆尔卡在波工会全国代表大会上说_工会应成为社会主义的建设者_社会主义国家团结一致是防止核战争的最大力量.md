Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 14th: The Fourth National Congress of Polish Trade Unions opened at 10 a.m. on April 14th in the conference hall of the Palace of Science and Culture in Warsaw. More than 800 delegates attended the congress, representing 5.3 million trade union members across Poland.

Leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government, Gomulka, Zawadzki, and Cyrankiewicz, attended today's opening ceremony. Representatives from other democratic parties and various sectors also attended the opening ceremony. Trade union delegations from 23 foreign countries, including the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Soviet Union, and China, were also invited to attend the congress.

The chairman of the Polish Miners' Trade Union, Hanke, announced the opening of the congress. He extended a warm welcome to the party and government leaders and foreign guests attending the congress. After electing the presidium and adopting the agenda, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Gomulka, addressed the congress.

In his speech, Gomulka emphasized the importance of trade unions in the people's state system. Gomulka said that the task of trade unions is to become builders of socialism. Gomulka pointed out that trade unions in socialist countries should take the development of the economic base as their guide in all their activities, because the economic base is the most important foundation of socialism.

In his speech, Gomulka pointed out that it is necessary to unite the trade unions of all countries within one international organization, which is the goal advocated and striven for by the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Gomulka spoke about Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the two Germanys. He said that Chancellor Adenauer's response to this proposal was to rush to obtain atomic weapons for his Federal Defense Forces.

Gomulka spoke about the Soviet Union's decision to suspend nuclear tests. He said that, so far, this proposal has not been accepted. On the contrary, the United States has indicated its intention to continue testing. The international trade union movement and workers' organizations in all countries face an urgent task: to closely unite the ranks of the international working class and jointly fight against the danger of thermonuclear war.

Gomulka expressed welcome and support for the movement launched by the West German trade unions against arming the Federal Defense Forces with atomic weapons. He said that the Polish working class and the Polish people support the struggle of the working class and people of other countries for peace.

Gomulka said that the greatest force to prevent the world from being plunged into the abyss of nuclear war is the solidarity and unity of all socialist countries on the basis of proletarian internationalism. The closer all socialist countries are united, the more effective our struggle for peace will be.

Gomulka also mentioned that in a few days, on the thirteenth anniversary of the signing of the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance, the Polish working class and people will once again express their loyalty to the fraternal friendship with the Soviet working class and people.

The chairman of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions and member of the Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party, Loga-Sowiński, delivered a report at the afternoon session on the activities and tasks of the trade unions.

He first assessed the changes that have taken place in Poland's political and social life in the four years between the Third and Fourth National Congresses of Polish Trade Unions. Loga-Sowiński also spoke about the international situation, with particular emphasis on the consequences of arming the West German Federal Defense Forces with atomic weapons.

    哥穆尔卡在波工会全国代表大会上说
    工会应成为社会主义的建设者
    社会主义国家团结一致是防止核战争的最大力量
    新华社华沙14日电　波兰工会第四次全国代表大会14日上午十时在华沙科学文化宫会议大厅开幕，出席大会的有八百多名代表，代表着波兰全国五百三十万工会会员。
    波兰统一工人党和政府的领导人哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹出席了今天的开幕式。出席开幕式的还有其他各民主党派的代表和各界的代表。世界工会联合会、苏联和中国等二十三个外国工会代表团也应邀出席了大会。
    波兰矿工工会主席汉克宣布大会开始，他向出席大会的党和政府领导者和各国来宾表示热烈欢迎。大会在选举主席团和通过议程后，统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡向大会讲了话。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中强调工会在人民国家制度中的重要性。哥穆尔卡说，工会的任务是成为社会主义的建设者。哥穆尔卡指出，社会主义国家的工会在它们的全部活动中应当以发展经济基础作为它们的指针，因为经济基础是社会主义的最重要的基础。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中指出，必须使一切国家的工会团结在一个国际组织内，这是世界工会联合会所建议和争取实现的目标。
    哥穆尔卡谈到波兰提出的在欧洲建立包括波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和两个德国在内的无原子武器区的建议。他说，阿登纳总理对这个建议的答复却是急忙为他的联邦国防军谋取原子武器。
    哥穆尔卡谈到苏联决定停止核试验的决议。他说，但是，到现在为止，这个建议还没有被接受。相反，美国已经表明他们打算继续进行试验。国际工会运动和各国工人组织面临着一个迫切的任务：紧密团结国际工人阶级的队伍，共同斗争，反对热核战争的危险。
    哥穆尔卡表示欢迎和支持西德工会发起的反对用原子武器武装联邦国防军的运动。他说，波兰工人阶级和波兰人民声援其他国家的工人阶级和人民进行的争取和平的斗争。
    哥穆尔卡说，防止把世界推入核战争深渊的最大的力量是所有社会主义国家在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上的团结一致。所有社会主义国家团结得越紧密，我们争取和平的斗争就越有成效。
    哥穆尔卡还谈到，过几天，在波苏友好互助条约签订十三周年的时候，波兰工人阶级和人民将再一次表示他们对于同苏联工人阶级和人民的兄弟友谊的忠诚。
    波兰工会中央理事会主席、波兰统一工人党政治局委员洛加—索文斯基在下午会议上作了关于工会的活动和任务的报告。
    他首先对波兰工会第三次代表大会到第四次代表大会之间的四年中波兰在政治生活和社会生活方面所发生的变化作了估价。洛加—索文斯基还谈到了国际局势，特别着重谈到了用原子武器武装西德联邦国防军的后果。
