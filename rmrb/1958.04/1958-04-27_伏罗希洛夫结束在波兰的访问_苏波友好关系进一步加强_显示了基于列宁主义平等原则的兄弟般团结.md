The two sides held friendly talks in an atmosphere of cordiality and full understanding, exchanging views on further developing and strengthening Soviet-Polish friendship.

The Soviet guests were warmly and sincerely welcomed by the Polish working people. These meetings once again proved that the Soviet-Polish friendship, which is highly valued by the people of both countries, is consolidated and unbreakable.

During their stay in Poland, the Soviet guests had extensive opportunities to familiarize themselves with the political, economic, and cultural life of the Polish people, as well as the achievements they have made under the leadership of their long-tested vanguard, the Polish United Workers' Party.

Voroshilov and others visited Poland at a time when Poland and the Soviet Union were solemnly celebrating the thirteenth anniversary of the signing of the historic Soviet-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation, and commemorating the anniversary of Lenin's birth. This visit vividly demonstrated the friendship between the Soviet and Polish peoples, showing their unity and brotherly solidarity based on Leninist principles of equality, as well as mutual assistance and support in the common struggle for socialism. This friendship and solidarity is a significant contribution to strengthening the unity of all countries in the socialist camp and consolidating world peace.

Chairman Voroshilov, on behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, invited Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish Council of State, to visit the Soviet Union at his convenience. Chairman Zawadzki has accepted the invitation.

Diplomatic envoys from various countries to Warsaw also attended the reception.

Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish Council of State, and Chairman Voroshilov spoke at the reception.

In his speech, Zawadzki praised the Soviet Union's friendly feelings towards the Polish people. He said that the visit of the Soviet delegation showed that both countries hoped to further develop economic, political, ideological, and cultural cooperation between the two countries for the welfare of the two peoples, for the strength and unity of our socialist camp, and for the cause of lasting world peace.

Zawadzki said that we are deeply convinced that every friendly meeting between the peoples, governments, and parties of Poland and the Soviet Union in the future will help to further deepen the fraternal, friendly, and cooperative relations that unite the two peoples.

Voroshilov said that our visit to Poland has made us even more convinced that the Polish people are overcoming all the difficulties they face and are energetically and confidently building their new socialist life. Like the Soviet people, the Polish people also sincerely hope to develop and consolidate Soviet-Polish friendship, and hope to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries in the world.

Voroshilov spoke of the recent decision by the West German Federal Parliament to equip the West German army with atomic weapons, as well as the conspiracy of the ruling groups in the United States to help West German revanchists and to try to turn Europe into a nuclear weapons depot. He said that the Soviet and Polish peoples, who have suffered the disasters of Hitler's aggression, cannot ignore the developments in West Germany and will draw due conclusions from them.

Voroshilov said that our achievements in socialist construction and the friendship of the people based on socialist principles are our most powerful weapons. If the people of all socialist countries march forward in friendship and unity on the road of socialism, then they will not be intimidated by any enemy's conspiracies and tricks.

    伏罗希洛夫说，我们在波兰的访问使得我们更加相信，波兰人民正在克服面临的一切困难，精力充沛地和满怀信心地建设自己的社会主义新生活。像苏联人民一样，波兰人民也真诚地希望发展和巩固波苏友谊，希望同世界各国人民和平友好相处。
    伏罗希洛夫谈到西德联邦议院最近通过以原子武器装备西德军队的决定，以及美国统治集团帮助西德复仇主义者和力图把欧洲变为核武器库的阴谋。他说，饱尝希特勒侵略灾祸的苏波两国人民不能漠视西德事态的发展，并且将从这里得出应有的结论。
