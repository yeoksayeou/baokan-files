    A Crucial Link

    The news from the Dalian Machine Tool Plant published today reports how the plant devolved part of its management authority and management cadres to the workshops, thereby adjusting the relationships between people in the production process. This adjustment greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers and masses, improved production efficiency, and increased production. This example once again vividly demonstrates the significant role of adjusting mutual relationships in promoting production development.

    The mutual relationships between people in the production process are an important aspect of production relations. According to Marxism-Leninism, production relations include three aspects: (1) the relationship of people to the ownership of the means of production, i.e., the issue of ownership of the means of production; (2) the mutual relationships between people in the production process; (3) the relationship of people to the distribution of products, i.e., the issue of distribution. Under the current conditions in our country, production relations are basically adapted to the productive forces, but contradictions also frequently occur. Because productive forces are the most active factor, they always precede production relations. Constantly adjusting the three links of production relations to adapt them to the continuously developing productive forces is the most fundamental issue in our national life.

    In terms of the ownership of the means of production, the old capitalist and small-scale production ownership have been basically transformed, and the new socialist ownership is basically adapted to the productive forces. Although there are contradictions that need to be resolved, the problems are not significant. In terms of mutual relationships, such as labor organization, production management, and the relationships between cadres and workers or farmers in production units, constant adjustments are needed. In terms of distribution, such as the distribution of national income, the distribution of cooperative income, wages, and benefits, there are also some problems that need to be resolved.

    In this rectification campaign, we are focusing on improving mutual relationships, driving the solution of problems in ownership and distribution. It can be said that this is a method of "grasping the middle and leading the two ends" because the mutual relationships between people in the production process are a relatively prominent issue at present. Whether these mutual relationships are appropriate has a significant impact on the development of productive forces. If appropriate, they will promote the development of productive forces; if inappropriate, they will hinder the development of productive forces. Since the rectification movement, due to the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the mutual relationships between people have been greatly improved, greatly promoting the development of productive forces. This is one of the important reasons for the current great leap forward in national production. Therefore, adjusting the mutual relationships between people in the production process is a problem that we must always pay attention to. This is not something that can be done or not done, but something that must be done seriously and well.

    重要的一环
    今天发表的大连机床厂的消息，报道了这个厂如何把厂一级的一部分管理权力和管理干部下放到车间中去，从而调整了人们在生产过程中的相互关系。这样的调整，大大刺激了工人群众的积极性，提高了生产效率，增加了生产。这个例子又一次生动地表明，相互关系的调整，对于发展生产有多么重大的推动作用。
    人们在生产过程中的相互关系，是生产关系的一个重要方面。按照马克思列宁主义，生产关系包含着三个方面，这就是：（一）人们对生产资料的占有关系，也就是生产资料所有制问题；（二）人们在生产过程中的相互关系；（三）人们对生产品的分配的关系，也就是分配问题。在目前我国条件下，生产关系和生产力是基本上适应的，但是也经常发生矛盾。因为生产力是最积极的因素，总是走在生产关系的前面。经常调整生产关系的三个环节，使之适应于不断发展的生产力，是我们国家生活中最根本的问题。
    在生产资料所有制方面，旧的资本主义的和小生产的所有制基本上已经完成改造了，新的社会主义的所有制基本上是适应于生产力的，虽然也有矛盾，需要加以解决，但问题不大。在相互关系方面，如劳动组织、生产管理、生产单位中干部和工人或农民的关系等，需要经常加以调整。在分配方面，如国民收入的分配，合作社收入的分配，工资福利等，也存在一些问题需要解决。
    在这次整风运动中，我们就是着重改进相互关系，带动解决所有制和分配中的问题，可以说这是“抓中间、带两头”的办法。因为人们在生产过程中的相互关系，是当前比较突出的问题。这种相互关系适当与否，对生产力的发展有着重大的影响。如果适当，它就会促进生产力的发展，如果不适当，它就会妨碍生产力的发展。整风运动以来，由于人民内部矛盾的正确处理，人们的相互关系有了极大的改进，大大促进了生产力的发展。这是目前全国生产大跃进的重要原因之一。因此，调整人们在生产过程中的相互关系，是我们必须经常注意的问题。这不是可做可不做，而是必须认真去做并且必须做好的事情。
