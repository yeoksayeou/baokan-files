Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: Officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are vigorously supporting the agricultural leap forward in various regions with the fighting spirit of storming the enemy lines.

Since last winter, troops stationed in various locations have vigorously supported the construction of farmland water conservancy projects. The Shenyang Military Region originally planned to contribute 2.85 million labor days to local production and construction this year, but recently increased it to 6 million labor days. In order to support water conservancy construction and grain production increase in Liaoning Province, the Shenyang Garrison decided to invest 850,000 labor days in the construction of the Hunsha Irrigation Canal (located between the Hun River and the Beisha River). This water conservancy project, upon completion in June, will be able to irrigate 360,000 mu of farmland, increasing grain production by 300 million jin. The Guangzhou Military Region's plan to support agricultural production with 4.3 million labor days this year was 60% completed by March. Nearly 300 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects constructed by the officers and soldiers, 130 have been completed, benefiting a total of more than 2.4 million mu of farmland. The Shanghai Garrison traveled day and night to the suburbs, completing the arduous task of digging 538 rivers in 18 days, eliminating snails in a total area of more than 3 million square meters, basically eliminating snails in the suburbs of Shanghai. A schistosomiasis expert said with emotion after seeing this situation: "I have been studying snail elimination work for decades, and I thought it would take at least decades to eliminate snails in the suburbs of Shanghai. Who knew that the People's Liberation Army would basically eliminate them in only 18 days?" In addition to helping local people build a reservoir and a hydroelectric power station with a power generation of about 1,500 kilowatts, a certain unit of the Fujian Front Line Troops also plans to reclaim 5,000 mu of wasteland this year, and give 3,500 mu of it to local farmers for cultivation free of charge.

During the spring plowing season, officers and soldiers of various troops also accumulated a large amount of fertilizer for agricultural cooperatives in various places. By the end of February, the Fujian Front Line Troops had accumulated more than 150,000 dan of fertilizer and sent it to various agricultural cooperatives one after another. In order to support the great leap forward in production of farmers of all ethnic groups, the Qinghai Garrison also plans to accumulate 7.34 million jin of fertilizer this year. The officers and soldiers of a certain company of the Wuhan Military Region seized their spare time to shovel grass, dig sludge, and sweep leaves everywhere. In just six or seven days, they accumulated more than 70,000 jin of fertilizer, and transported the fertilizer to the local agricultural cooperatives by themselves with carts. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison decided to spend 5,000 labor days to accumulate 3.55 million jin of fertilizer and send it all to the agricultural cooperatives near the驻地 (zhùdì: place where troops are stationed). The officers and soldiers of a certain regiment of the Kunming Military Region originally planned to accumulate 200,000 jin of fertilizer this year, but by mid-February they had overfulfilled the annual target, accumulating a total of more than 255,000 jin of fertilizer. While rushing to accumulate fertilizer, a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region also dispatched 25 horse-drawn carts to transport more than 1.2 million jin of fertilizer to wheat fields and spring fields for agricultural cooperatives in three days. The members of the agricultural cooperatives composed a ballad saying: "Fat horses, green uniforms, the army is helping to transport manure busily; this year will definitely increase production, and the granaries will be full of grain; the people are rich, the country is strong, and support the army to defend the country."

    解放军支援各地农业生产
    各部队在兴修水利积肥运动中成绩巨大
    据新华社1日讯　中国人民解放军官兵以冲锋陷阵的战斗姿态，大力支援各地农业大跃进。
    各地驻军去冬以来大力支援各地兴修农田水利工程，沈阳部队原定今年以二百八十五万个劳动日支援地方的生产建设，最近提高到六百万个劳动日。为了支援辽宁省水利建设和粮食增产，沈阳驻军决定以八十五万个劳动日投入浑沙灌溉渠（位于浑河和北沙河之间）的修建工程。这一水利工程在6月份完工后，可以灌溉农田三十六万亩，增产粮食三亿斤。广州部队今年以四百三十万个劳动日支援农业生产的计划，到3月份就完成了60％，官兵们修建的近三百项大、中型水利工程有一百三十项已经完工，受益农田共二百四十多万亩。上海驻军日夜兼程开赴郊区，在十八天内就完成了挖河五百三十八条的艰巨任务，消灭钉螺总面积达三百多万平方公尺，做到基本上消灭了上海郊区的钉螺。一位血吸虫病专家看到这种情况感动地说：“我研究了几十年的灭螺工作，认为要消灭上海郊区的钉螺，最少还要几十年，那知解放军只十八天就基本上把它消灭了。”福建前线部队某部今年除了要帮助当地人民修建一座水库和一座发电量约一千五百瓩的水力发电站外，还计划开垦荒地五千亩，并且把其中的三千五百亩无偿地交给当地农民耕种。
    在春耕季节里各部队官兵还给各地农业社积攒了大量的肥料。福建前线部队到2月下旬已经积肥十五万多担，陆续送给了各农业社。青海驻军为了支援各族农民生产大跃进，今年也计划积肥七百三十四万斤。武汉部队某连官兵抓紧课余时间，到处铲草、挖污泥、扫树叶，仅六、七天的时间就积肥七万多斤，并且自己拉车把肥料送给了当地的农业社。北京部队某部官兵决定抽出五千个劳动日，争取积肥三百五十五万斤，全部送给驻地附近的农业社。昆明部队某团官兵原定今年积肥二十万斤，到2月中旬就超额实现了全年指标，共积肥二十五万五千多斤，济南部队某部在突击积肥的同时，还抽调出二十五辆马车，在三天内就为农业社向麦田和春田里运送肥料一百二十多万斤。社员们编了一首歌谣说：“肥膘马，绿军装，军队帮助运粪忙；今年定增产，粮食装满仓；人民富，国家强，支援军队保国防。”
