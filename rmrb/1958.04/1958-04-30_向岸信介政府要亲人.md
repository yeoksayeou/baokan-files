	Demanding Relatives from the Nobusuke Kishi Government
	Editor's Note: Liu Lianren has returned to his hometown of Gaomi County, Shandong, after fourteen years of separation. His suffering has ended, and a happy life has begun. However, countless fellow countrymen who were abducted by Japanese militarists are still missing. Here, the letters from direct victims and their families provide new clues once again. Nobusuke Kishi, one of the masterminds behind the Japanese war of aggression and the current head of the Japanese government, can hardly escape the responsibility of accounting for the whereabouts of our abducted compatriots and compensating for the losses.

	Liu Ouyangrong from Shanghai writes:
	Liu Lianren survived fourteen years of hardship and inhuman life. I am glad that he was able to return to his motherland alive. However, I cannot help but recall with grief and pain my husband, Liu Jingchi (courtesy name Runquan, from Kaifeng, Henan). In 1942, he was tied up and taken away by Japanese invaders in northern Henan and escorted to the puppet "Labor Association" in Taiyuan. For sixteen years, there has been no news of him. Japanese militarism committed many heinous crimes in our country, sacrificing the precious lives of countless people and leaving incurable wounds on the spirits and bodies of many survivors! It is hateful that the Kishi Nobusuke government has not shown any remorse. I request the government to investigate the whereabouts of my husband and to account for the situation of the abducted compatriots.

	Liu Beihai from Changping, Hebei, writes:
	In August 1943, I was taken by the invading Japanese army from Tanggu onto a ship and transported to Japan. I was forced to work as a coolie in Fukushima Prefecture, Nagano Prefecture, and the Oketo Village mine in Hokkaido. More than four hundred compatriots were sent to Japan with me, but only more than two hundred survived and returned home in December 1945! The remaining compatriots died due to inhuman enslavement, abuse, hunger, and disease. The blood debt that Japanese militarists owe the Chinese people is incalculable. The Kishi Nobusuke government cannot escape its due responsibility and must compensate Liu Lianren and all the compatriots who died in Japan for all their losses.

	Zhu Ruikai from Nanjing writes:
	My father, Zhu Rongfu, was a worker in a shoe store in Shanghai. In August 1945, when the Japanese invaders had already surrendered, they abducted my father from the street when they retreated from Shanghai back to their country, and there has been no news of him ever since. The Liu Lianren incident reminds me with grief and indignation of my father, who was abducted by the Japanese fascist bandits. I firmly demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government must account for the whereabouts of my father and the many abducted compatriots.

	Li Guangwu from Xinxiang, Henan, writes:
	In 1943, I was abducted by Japanese invaders and escorted by the puppet North China Labor Association via Tanggu to the Sakito-machi Mitsubishi coal mine in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, to work as a coolie. I lived for two years in a human hell that was worse than the life of a beast. In the first year, seventy-two compatriots died because they could not withstand the torment. In October 1944, the Japanese invaders arrested forty-seven compatriots under the pretext of a mine collapse incident and sent them to Nagasaki, and they were never seen again. Now, the bloody atrocities of Japanese militarists have not been duly punished, and today the Kishi Nobusuke government is still adopting a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people, which is truly unbearable. As one of the victims, I firmly demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government account for the whereabouts of the forty-seven compatriots who were escorted to Nagasaki Prefecture and compensate Liu Lianren and the deceased compatriots for their losses!

    向岸信介政府要亲人
    编者按　刘连仁已经回到离别十四年的家乡山东高密县，他的苦难结束了，幸福的生活开始了。但是，还有无数当年被日本军国主义者掳去的难胞，至今仍然没有下落。这里，本报发表的几封直接受害者和他们家属的来信，又一次提供了新的线索，作为当年日本侵略战争策划者的元凶之一和今日日本政府首脑的岸信介，决难逃避交代被掳去的我国难胞的下落和赔偿损失的责任。
    上海刘欧阳荣来信说：
    刘连仁熬过了十四年的辛酸和非人生活，我庆幸他能够生还祖国。但是，我又不禁悲愤和痛苦地忆起我的丈夫刘敬池（字润泉，河南开封人），1942年他在豫北被日寇捆绑带走，押解到太原伪“劳工协会”以后，十六年来一直音讯全无。日本军国主义在我国犯下许多令人发指的滔天罪行，它使多少人牺牲了宝贵的生命，它在多少活着的人的精神上和肉体上留下难以医治的创伤！可恨岸信介政府到现在丝毫还没有悔过之心，我请求政府要它查明我丈夫的下落，交代被掳去的难胞情况。
    河北昌平刘北海来信说：
    1943年8月，我被日本侵略军队从塘沽押送上船运往日本，先后被迫在福岛县、长野县和北海道置户村矿山里充当苦工。和我一起被送往日本的难胞有四百多人，而在1945年12月生还回国的，只剩下二百多人了！其余的难胞由于受到非人的奴役、虐待、饥饿和疾病而死亡了。日本军国主义者欠下中国人民的血债是无法计算的，岸信介政府决逃避不了应负的责任，必须赔偿刘连仁以及在日本死亡的难胞一切损失。
    南京朱瑞开来信说：
    我父亲朱荣富，原是上海一个皮鞋店的工人，1945年8月日本侵略者已经投降，但它从上海撤退回国的时候，却在街上将我父亲掳走，至今全无音讯。刘连仁事件使我悲愤地回忆起被日本法西斯强盗掳走的我的父亲，我坚决要求：岸信介政府必须交代我父亲以及被掳去的许多难胞的下落。
    河南新乡李广武来信说：
    1943年我被日寇掳去，由伪华北劳工协会经塘沽押解到日本长崎县崎户町三菱煤矿充当苦工，过了两年牛马不如的人间地狱生活。在第一年，就有七十二名难胞受不了折磨而死去。1944年10月，日本侵略者借口矿井倒塌事件逮捕了四十七位难胞，送到长崎，以后就一直没有再见到他们。现在，日本军国主义者的血腥兽行并没有得到应有的惩罚，而今天岸信介政府对中国人民还在采取敌对的态度，实在令人忍无可忍。作为当年受害者之一，我坚决要求岸信介政府交代当年押送到长崎县的四十七名难胞的下落，并赔偿刘连仁和死难同胞的损失！
