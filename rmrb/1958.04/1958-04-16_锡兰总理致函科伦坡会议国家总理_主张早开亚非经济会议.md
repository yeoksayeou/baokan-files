Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 15th: According to the Press Trust of India, a Ceylon official spokesman said today that Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike has written to the Prime Ministers of the Colombo Conference countries, hoping to hold a meeting soon to discuss regional trade and economic cooperation issues.

Bandaranaike's suggestion was put forward in private letters he wrote to the Prime Ministers of India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma last week. His suggestion was first put forward at the Ceylon National Planning Council in March. At that time, the council welcomed this idea and asked Bandaranaike to promote its realization.

He emphasized that a meeting of the nature he proposed would be particularly desirable because the role of specialized agencies such as the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, which does not include China, is limited.

Bandaranaike suggested that this conference could be an extension of the economic cooperation resolutions adopted at the 1955 Bandung Afro-Asian Conference, and all countries participating in the Afro-Asian Conference could participate, or initially only Asian countries could participate.

He also suggested that issues such as food supply, transportation, and regional planning could be part of the urgent and important issues for effective discussion at the conference.

He also suggested that the conference should not discuss issues related to regional conflicts and international political differences.

    锡兰总理致函科伦坡会议国家总理
    主张早开亚非经济会议
    据新华社新德里15日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，锡兰官方发言人今天说，锡兰总理班达拉奈克已经致函科伦坡会议国家的总理们，希望早日举行会议来讨论区域性的贸易和经济合作问题。
    班达拉奈克的建议是在上星期他写给印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸的总理的私人信件中提出的。他的建议最先是3月间在锡兰全国计划理事会上提出来的。当时理事会欢迎这个意见，并且要求班达拉奈克促使它实现。
    他曾经强调说，他所建议召开的那种性质的会议将是特别可取的。因为像没有中国参加的亚洲及远东经济委员会这样的专门机构的作用是有限的。
    班达拉奈克曾经建议，这个会议可以作为1955年万隆亚非会议通过的经济合作决议的伸延，所有参加亚非会议的国家都可以参加，或者在最初仅限于亚洲国家参加。
    他还曾经建议，粮食供应、运输和地区计划等问题可以作为会议上进行有效的讨论的紧迫而重要的问题的一部分。
    他还建议，这个会议不讨论有关地区之间的冲突和国际政治性分歧的问题。
