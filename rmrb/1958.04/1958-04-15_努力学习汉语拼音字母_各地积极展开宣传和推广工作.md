　　Strive to Learn the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet
　　Active Publicity and Promotion Work Carried Out in Various Regions
    Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: After the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme was approved by the National People's Congress, many places across the country have actively arranged to carry out publicity and promotion work.
    The Central Putonghua Promotion Working Committee has issued a notice requiring all provinces and cities to quickly convene Putonghua promotion work conferences to formulate plans for promoting the phonetic alphabet and Putonghua. The Working Committee and the Ministry of Education have also notified all provinces and cities to actively prepare for holding a Putonghua teaching achievement observation meeting during this year's summer vacation.
    Shandong and Sichuan provinces have already established their 1958 Putonghua promotion work plans. Both provinces plan to intensify the training of teachers so that from the autumn of 1958, the first grade of primary and secondary schools and normal schools can use the phonetic alphabet to teach Putonghua; before the summer vacation of 1958, graduating students of secondary normal schools and higher normal schools should be able to learn the phonetic alphabet and be basically able to teach in Putonghua. Both provinces are also preparing to conduct experiments in a few qualified factories, mines, rural areas, and neighborhoods to use the phonetic alphabet to help eliminate illiteracy.
    The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has decided to launch a surge of learning the phonetic alphabet this semester, organizing all teachers in universities, middle schools, and primary schools throughout the province to conduct a study of the phonetic alphabet. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Education is preparing to adopt methods such as large classes, mobile teaching, listening to broadcasts, and listening to phonetic alphabet records to enable teachers and students to universally learn the phonetic alphabet and Putonghua.
    The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education has already held a rotational training class for Putonghua phonetics lecturers, drawing elementary school teachers from various counties and cities to participate in learning. The education departments of Shaanxi, Zhejiang, and Shanxi provinces and the radio stations of these three provinces also held "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Teaching Broadcast Lectures" in March, organizing teachers, cadres, and others to listen.

    努力学习汉语拼音字母
    各地积极展开宣传和推广工作
    新华社14日讯　汉语拼音方案经全国人民代表大会批准后，全国许多地方都积极布置展开宣传和推广工作。
    中央推广普通话工作委员会已经发出通知，要求各省市迅速召开推广普通话工作会议，拟出推广拼音字母和普通话的计划。工作委员会和教育部还通知各省市积极筹备，在今年暑期举行普通话教学成绩观摩会。
    山东、四川两省已经订出了1958年推广普通话的工作计划。两省都计划加紧训练教师，以便从1958年秋季开始，中、小学和师范学校一年级都能利用拼音字母教学普通话；1958年暑假前，中等师范学校和高等师范学校应届毕业生都能学会拼音字母并能基本上用普通话教学。两省并准备在少数有条件的工矿、农村、街道进行利用拼音字母帮助扫除文盲的实验。
    江苏省教育厅决定在本学期内掀起一次学习拼音字母的热潮，组织全省大、中、小学全体教师进行一次拼音字母的学习。山西省教育厅准备采用上大课、巡回教学、收听广播、听拼音字母唱片等办法，使教师、学生普遍学习拼音字母和普通话。
    陕西省教育厅已经举办普通话语音讲师轮训班，抽调各县、市小学教师参加学习。陕西、浙江、山西三省教育厅同这三个省的广播电台在3月份也都举办了“汉语拼音字母教学广播讲座”，组织教师、干部等收听。
