Xinhua News Agency Report: Agricultural scientists and technicians from the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture, August 1st Agricultural College, and Academy of Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Sciences have compiled seven agricultural science and technology publications tailored to the conditions of Xinjiang for farmers of all ethnic groups. These publications are currently being edited and translated by the Autonomous Region People's Publishing House and will soon be published and distributed in large quantities in both Chinese and Uyghur.

The "Xinjiang Agricultural Technology Series" consists of fourteen books with a total of 350,000 words. Thirteen of these books were written by twenty professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from Xinjiang August 1st Agricultural College, using materials they collected and researched over the past few years while working in Xinjiang's rural areas and military reclamation farms, combined with relevant data from local agricultural departments. The books analyze the complex natural conditions of various regions in Xinjiang and address many issues, such as how to improve soil, cultivate crops, prevent wind and sand, plant trees, prevent and control major pests and diseases, and rationally organize labor under different natural conditions. The other book is a compilation of the high-yield experiences of farmers of all ethnic groups and some military reclamation farms in Xinjiang in 1957 with crops such as cotton, wheat, rice, and corn, written by the Autonomous Region's Department of Agriculture. The other books cover topics such as accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, and cultivating rapeseed. These seven books can be used by agricultural technicians, rural cadres, and farmers for study, and also as reference materials for agricultural schools in the Xinjiang region.
