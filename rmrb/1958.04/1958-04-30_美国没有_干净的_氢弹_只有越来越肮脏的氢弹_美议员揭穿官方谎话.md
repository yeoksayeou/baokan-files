Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 29th. Democratic Senator Anderson, in a speech delivered on the 27th, exposed the lie spread by the US government that the US is manufacturing so-called "clean" hydrogen bombs.

Anderson said that after the US military learned of new improvements, they would take hydrogen bombs out of storage at any time and try to make them more powerful. He said, "Doing so makes the hydrogen bombs dirtier."

The so-called "clean" hydrogen bomb is a deceptive claim put forward by the US authorities in order to continue the nuclear arms race. Under the pretext of manufacturing so-called non-radioactive hydrogen bombs, they insisted that the United States should continue nuclear testing. In contrast to this so-called "clean" hydrogen bomb, the current hydrogen bombs are called "dirty" hydrogen bombs.

Anderson is the former vice-chairman and current member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of both houses. He said on an NBC television program that the US military is not only constantly storing dirtier hydrogen bombs, but also taking some hydrogen bombs out of storage and putting things into them that make them even dirtier.

### 美国没有“干净的”氢弹  只有越来越肮脏的氢弹  美议员揭穿官方谎话

    美议员揭穿官方谎话
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：民主党参议员安德森在27日发表的一篇演说中，揭穿了美国官方散布的美国正在制造所谓“干净的”氢弹的谎言。
    安德森说，美国军方在知道了新的改进办法以后，就随时把氢弹从储存中取出来并且设法使它们更具有威力。他说，“这样做就使氢弹更脏了。”
    所谓“干净的”氢弹是美国当局为了继续核军备竞赛而提出的一个欺人的说法。他们以制造所谓没有放射性的氢弹为遁词，坚持美国要继续进行核试验。同这种所谓“干净的”氢弹相对，目前的氢弹则被称为“肮脏的”氢弹。
    安德森是两院原子能联合委员会前副主席、现任该委员会委员。他在美国全国广播公司的电视节目中说，美国军方不仅不断储存比较肮脏的氢弹，而且从储存的氢弹中抽出一些氢弹，装进一些使它们变得更肮脏的东西。
