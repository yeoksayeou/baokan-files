    Spring Flowers Bloom Everywhere
    Chen Junyu
    Around Qingming Festival, the sun is bright and the breeze is gentle. In this beautiful spring, all kinds of flowers bloom one after another. Across the magnificent landscape of our motherland, everywhere is a scene of a hundred flowers blooming, a truly spectacular sight.
    Let's start with Beijing. Although spring comes late in the north, the peonies and Prunus triloba are only just budding, but the Forsythia and mountain peach blossoms have already broken the silence of the gardens. Those yellow flowers are like countless small trumpets playing the song of welcoming spring. The mountain peach is a specialty of northern China, known for its cold and drought resistance, and its early blooming. In the Western Hills or in the parks, you can see its pink flowers, nestled among the green pines and cypresses.
    If you are in Guangzhou right now, you will see a completely different southern scene than in Beijing—here, it is not just the tentative blooming of spring flowers, but a vibrant competition of all blossoms! In the north, cannas, dahlias, cosmos, and Mirabilis jalapa are flowers that bloom in summer and autumn; but here, they are already blooming in clusters. What is particularly lovely is the white magnolia, which can grow to several feet tall and has thousands of blossoms on one tree. Like jade or orchids, it blooms all year round; it is a precious flower, yet it is also modestly used as a roadside tree.
    If you are in Chengdu, the "Land of Abundance," you can catch the annual "Flower Fair" and see the flower exhibitions of Jin City. Most prominent is the saying, "The land of Min and Shu stretches for thousands of miles, but the crabapple is uniquely beautiful"; and the "Little Peach Red" is abundant in flowers and beautiful in color, comparable to the northern Prunus triloba. In addition, there are various kinds of peonies, azaleas, freesias, sweet peas, and more... all of which have many varieties and are captivating.
    In Shanghai, the double-flowered peach blossoms are in full bloom, some crimson, some pure white, some speckled with gold, and some with purple leaves. The Chinese redbud is bright red, the Prunus glandulosa 'Alba Plena' is snowy white, and there are various cherry blossoms, as well as many fragrant orchids... There are also the greenhouse flowers in the western suburbs: carnations, cyclamen, calla lilies, musk, lilies, and more.
    Spring flowers bloom everywhere in the motherland, no wonder our country has always been known as the "Mother of Gardens" in the world. Flowers all have their own characteristics. Different flowers have their own different homelands, and they also have different requirements. The white magnolia, which is native to the tropics, can flourish in Guangzhou, with thousands of blossoms on one tree, but in Shanghai and Beijing, it can only be grown in greenhouses in pots, growing into a shrub. Similarly, the Prunus persica thrives in the Jiangnan area; but in Guangzhou, it grows weakly and does not bloom much. Therefore, for all kinds of flowers, we must first fully understand their habits, and then transform nature based on adapting to nature.
    Our country's flower species are indeed extremely rich, but there are still many wild ornamental plants that have not yet been introduced for cultivation. For example, the Davidia involucrata is a world-renowned ornamental tree, which blooms large white flowers in April and is known as the "Chinese Dove Tree." Currently, it has been planted as a central feature in European and American gardens, but in our country, the Davidia involucrata still grows silently in the mountains of Sichuan and Hubei. Faced with these facts, it is hoped that afforestation workers, in addition to the current widespread afforestation work, should also pay appropriate attention to introducing and domesticating the country's wild ornamental plants as soon as possible. Let our afforestation materials be richer and more beautiful, and let our abundant resources serve socialist cities and villages more and better!

    春花遍地开
    陈俊愉
    清明前后，日丽风和，在这明媚的春光里，各色各样的花朵先后盛开。在祖国锦绣河山间，到处都是百花齐放，盛景可观。
    让我们先看看北京吧。虽然北地春迟，牡丹和榆叶梅还刚在孕蕾，可是迎春和山桃的花枝已经打破了园林中的岑寂。那朵朵黄花，好似无数的小喇叭奏起了迎春之歌。山桃是我国北方的特产，它抗寒抗旱，着花特早。在西山，或是公园里，都可看到它那一片粉红的花朵，掩映在苍松翠柏之前。
    假若你现在正在广州，那你就会看到全然不同于北京的南国风光——这里已不是春花试放，而是群芳竞盛、百卉争荣！在北方，美人蕉、大丽花、波斯菊、紫茉莉都是夏秋放开的花卉；但在这儿，现在它们就已花团锦簇似地盛开着了。令人喜爱的还是高达数丈、一树千花的白兰花。如玉若兰，它终年开花；它是名贵的花木，却又能质朴地被人们当作行道树用。
    如果你正在天府之国的成都，这时正可赶上一年一度的“花会”，看一看锦城的花卉展览。最为突出的是“岷蜀地千里，海棠花独妍”；而“小桃红”花繁色丽，可与北方的榆叶梅先后媲美。此外像形形色色的牡丹、杜鹃、小苍兰、香豌豆，……也都品类繁多，引人入胜。
    在上海，这里的重瓣桃花正开得缦烂芳菲，有的绛红，有的纯白，有的洒金，有的紫叶。而紫荆嫣红，笑靥花雪白，还有那各色各样的樱花，以及许多芳香馥郁的兰花……。还有西郊的温室花卉：康纳馨、仙客来、水芋、麝香、百合等。
    祖国春花遍地开，无怪我国一向被称为世界上的“园林之母”。花，都有它们各自的特点。不同的花卉各有它不同的故乡，也有它不同的要求。原产热带的白兰花，在广州可以繁茂滋荣，一树千花，而在上海、北京，却只能行温室盆栽，长成一株灌木的样子。同样，碧桃在江南一带木茂花繁；可是到了广州，它却生势衰弱，着花不多。所以对于形形色色的花卉，我们首先要充分了解它们的习性，然后在顺应自然的基础上来改造自然。
    我国的花卉种类真是极其丰富，可是，还有更多的野生观赏植物至今还没有引入种植。譬如珙桐是世界上驰名的观赏树，4月间开大形白花，有“中国鸽子树”之称。目前它已在欧美的园林中栽作中心景物了，而在祖国，珙桐却仍旧默默地生长于川鄂山野之间。面对着这些事实，希望绿化工作者在当前普遍绿化工作之余，也要适当注意及早引种驯化祖国的野生观赏植物。让我们的绿化树材更丰富、更美丽，让我们的丰富资源更多、更好地为社会主义城市与乡村服务吧！
