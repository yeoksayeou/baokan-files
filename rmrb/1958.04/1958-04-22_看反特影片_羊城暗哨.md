    Watching the anti-espionage film always fills me with excitement. I am impressed by the courage and ingenuity of our public security personnel, and moved by their selfless dedication to the motherland. I felt the same way when watching the film "Raid on the Secret Agents."

    "Raid on the Secret Agents" attracts me not only with its educational theme and subject matter, but also with its bright style and concise and clean handling techniques, which also aroused my great interest. Many scenes in it were obviously carefully designed. For example, the place where the spy Boss Ma, who is quite important in the film, often appears, is deliberately arranged in an antique shop. There, the weak, dim light shines on the antiques, and shadows loom everywhere, making it look gloomy and terrifying; and Boss Ma receives his cronies in this terrifying cave. This kind of background sets off Boss Ma as old dregs, people spurned by the times.

    In order to make the plot tortuous and dramatic, and to capture the hearts of the audience, the film uses many dangerous moves. Events often develop one after another. For example, after the public security personnel captured the spy Two-Zero-Nine who sneaked into the country, they used his materials to connect with the spy Little Immortal, and then met another spy, Eighth Aunt. The work seemed to be progressing smoothly; however, at this moment, Eighth Aunt suddenly ignored the reliable documents and questioned Wang Lian, the public security officer who was using the alias Two-Zero-Nine. This approach was unexpected by the audience. The audience watched nervously how Wang Lian would deal with it. Unexpectedly, Wang Lian was calm and unhurried, turning defense into offense. He snatched Eighth Aunt's pistol and forced her to question her. His "serious" attitude not only won Eighth Aunt's trust, but also convinced the audience. Moreover, this treatment not only strengthened the film's atmosphere of suspense, but also expounded the theme thought, showing the extraordinary courage of our public security personnel and exposing the vicious cunning of the spies.

    However, when using dangerous moves, the film also has some missteps, such as the handling of the character Aunt Mei. Aunt Mei is the leader of the group of spies depicted in the film. She is the superior that the spies fear, and also the character that Wang Lian, the detective who went deep into the wolf's den, has repeatedly tried to detect but has never been able to discover. Precisely because she occupies a fairly important position in the development of events, and precisely because she is often mentioned but has not appeared for a long time, it further strengthens the mystery of this character, prompting the audience to want to see the true face of this character more eagerly. While using other plots and techniques to attract the audience, the film also strives to capture the audience through the description of this character, which can not be said to be a clever move; but when Aunt Mei really appears in front of the audience, and the audience sees that she is the maid Liu Ma in Eighth Aunt's house (Wang Lian lives in Eighth Aunt's house), they can't help but be stunned: "So it was her!" This contains unexpected surprise, but also contains some disappointment. Because here, the audience can't help but ask such a question: What is the purpose of Aunt Mei disguising herself as Liu Ma? If it is to monitor Eighth Aunt, Eighth Aunt is a veteran spy, and can be said to be "loyal" to her "organization", so it seems unnecessary; if it is to monitor Wang Lian, the film does not clearly show this point. The people in the play, as "insiders," can be "confused," but the audience, as "outsiders," cannot but be "clear," otherwise the audience will not be able to figure out what medicine is being sold in the gourd. Secondly, Aunt Mei's identity has always been hidden, so how does she, as a leader, contact her minions, and how does she give orders? This is also not explained or revealed in the film, so it also makes the audience confused. In the original film literary script, Aunt Mei was originally Boss Ma's code name. Although this treatment is a bit plain, it is more reasonable. Now the film has added the role of Liu Ma and let her play Aunt Mei, which can naturally be said to be a dangerous move; but from the perspective of the slightly ambiguous plot, it is not necessarily a failure.

### 看反特影片“羊城暗哨”

    看反特影片“羊城暗哨”
    方曙
    每次看反特影片的时候，内心都感到无比振奋。为我们公安工作人员的英勇机智所折服，也为他们忘我的献身于祖国的赤诚所感动。在看影片“羊城暗哨”时，也有着同样的感觉。
    “羊城暗哨”不仅以它富有教育意义的主题和题材吸引着我，它的明快的风格和简洁干净的处理手法，同样也引起我极大的兴趣。其中不少场面看得出是经过精心设计的。例如影片中相当重要的特务马老板经常出现的场所，便是有意被安排在一个古玩店中的。在那里，微弱的、暗淡的灯光照在古董上，四处黑影幢幢，显得阴森可怕；而马老板便在这恐怖的洞窟里接待他的狐群狗党。这样的背景衬托出马老板是陈旧的渣滓，是时代所唾弃的人。
    为了使故事情节曲折和富有戏剧性，能抓住观众的心，影片中用了不少险笔。事件发展常常是一波未平，一波又起。例如公安工作人员捕获了潜入国境的特务二零九后，利用他的材料，和特务小神仙牵上线，会到了另一特务八姑，工作似乎进行得很顺利；然而就在这时候，八姑突然不理会那可靠的证件，盘问起化名二零九的公安人员王练来。这种做法，是出乎观众意外的。观众怀着紧张的心情注视着王练如何对付。不料王练却从容不迫，反守为攻。他夺过了八姑的手枪，逼着盘问起她来。他的“认真”的态度，不但赢得了八姑的信任，也使观众信服。而且这样处理，既加强了影片的惊险气氛，又阐发了主题思想，表现了我们公安工作人员的英勇绝伦，暴露了特务的狠毒狡猾。
    可是在运用险笔的时候，影片也有失笔之处，例如对于梅姨这个人物的处理便是。梅姨是影片中所描写的那一群特务的头子。她是特务们所畏惧的上司，也是深入狼窟的侦察员王练一再想侦查到而一直未能发现的人物。正因为她在事件发展中占着相当重要的地位，正因为她老被人们提起而又迟迟没有出现，就愈益加强了这个人物的神秘性，促使观众更急切地想一睹这个人物的真面目。影片在利用旁的情节和技巧来吸引观众的同时，也力求通过对这个人物的描叙来抓住观众，不能不说是它的一个巧妙之处；但是当梅姨真正出现在观众面前，观众看出她便是八姑家的女佣刘妈时（王练便是住在八姑家里的），便不禁愕然了：“原来就是她呀！”这里包含着料想不到的惊讶，但是也包含着若干成分的失望。因为在这里，观众便不得不发出这样的疑问了：梅姨化装成刘妈的目的何在呢？如果说是为了监视八姑，八姑是个老牌特务，对于她的“组织”可以说是“忠心耿耿”的，似乎用不着；如果说是监视王练，影片中又没有比较清楚地把这一点表现出来。作为“当局者”的剧中人可以“迷”，作为“旁观者”的观众是不能不“清”的，否则葫芦里卖的什么药，观众便摸不着头脑了。其次，梅姨的身份一直是隐蔽的，那么作为一个头子，她通过什么办法和她的爪牙联系，她通过什么发号施令，这在影片中同样也没有交代和透露，因此同样也使观众弄不清楚。原电影文学剧本中，梅姨本来是马老板的代号，这样处理，虽然平淡一些，却比较合乎情理。现在影片增加了刘妈这个角色，并且让她来充当梅姨，自然可以说是险笔了；但从剧情稍嫌含混上来看，未始又不是败笔呢。
