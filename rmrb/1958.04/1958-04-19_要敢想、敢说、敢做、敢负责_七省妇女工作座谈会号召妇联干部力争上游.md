Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 18th. The All-China Women's Federation convened a symposium on women's work in seven provinces (autonomous region) including Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Hunan in Wuhan from the 6th to the 13th. More than 40 people attended the meeting, including directors and propaganda cadres of provincial and autonomous region women's federations, and some directors of special (city) and county women's federations.

Since last winter and this spring, the revolutionary zeal of women has been unprecedentedly high, playing a huge role on the production front. The characteristics are: high attendance rate, frequent attendance, wide range of labor, good labor arrangement, great enthusiasm of women, good innovative spirit, and courage to overcome difficulties. Materials at the meeting showed that women's attendance generally accounts for more than 90% of the female labor force, and in many areas it has reached 100%. Women can generally work 150 to 200 workdays a year. After men went to build large-scale water conservancy projects in many areas, most of the tasks of fertilizer accumulation, farmland management, small-scale water conservancy construction, afforestation, and sideline production were undertaken by women. In Ningming County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, plowing has always been done by men, but this spring, because men went to work on water conservancy projects, in order to catch up with the spring plowing season, more than 11,000 women learned to use the Wusan step plow and the double-wheeled double-share plow to undertake the spring planting tasks. Women have also shown great skills in controlling mountains and rivers. In Yuxian County, Henan Province alone, more than 43,000 women have been put into mountain and river control projects. In addition to completing the management of 913 mountain tops with male farmers, they also organized 59 women's mountain control commando teams to manage 112 mountain tops. Women's canals, women's reservoirs, March 8th orchards, March 8th forests, women's high-yield fields, and women-created vehicles, farm tools, and furniture can be found everywhere in various provinces and counties. An unprecedented upsurge of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced has also been set off among women, and thousands of heroes, models, and various skilled workers have emerged. Social perceptions and public opinion of women have also changed significantly compared to the past.

The meeting believed that with the great leap forward situation of women, women's work in various places is also leaping forward to varying degrees. Women's federation cadres are full of energy and have many methods. The women's federation organizations are active, have a significant promoting effect, and the leadership style and cadre style have also undergone significant changes. The current outstanding task of women's work is to encourage and educate women to study diligently, practice hard, study technology, and boldly create innovations in order to further improve labor efficiency. Advocating and supporting women to participate in planting experimental fields is a good way to improve women's skills. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay close attention to discovering the advanced and summarizing, commending, and promoting the advanced, and to launch a mass movement to learn technology, learn from the advanced, and create large-scale high yields. After Shaanxi Province promoted the cotton planting technology of Zhang Qiuxiang, a cotton planting expert and national labor model, more than 5,300 women in 31 counties in the Guanzhong area proposed to learn from Zhang Qiuxiang and strive to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin of seed cotton per mu this year. Due to the vigorous publicity of high-yield models among women in Hubei and other provinces, hundreds and thousands of cotton girls, peanut girls, silkworm girls, and rice girls who strive for high yields have also emerged. In addition, it is also necessary to mobilize women to participate in cultural and technical night schools, technical training classes, or other activities to learn culture and technology, and suggest that relevant departments plan to train a group of female agricultural science and technology personnel.

The meeting believed that women's federations at all levels must thoroughly change their leadership style and earnestly achieve going deep into reality, deep into production, and deep into the masses. Women's federation cadres above the special district level, except for the old, weak, and sick, should spend at least four months of the year going deep into the grassroots. Women's federation cadres at all levels should run experimental fields or carry out business experimental points according to the spirit of running experimental fields. In addition to running experimental fields, women's federation cadres in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, also learned a production technology, realizing the specialization of cadres, which is of great significance for women's federation cadres to strive to be both red and expert. For women's federation organizations above the special district level, all meetings that can be held at the lower level should be held at the lower level. According to the experience of Hongan County in Hubei and Ningxiang County in Hunan, it is a good method worth popularizing to move the county women's federation offices to key townships to facilitate close contact with the masses and timely discovery and resolution of problems. Participants also unanimously believed that women's federation cadres must constantly fight against the "five airs," not be narrow-minded, not care about personal interests, have socialist consciousness, and proceed from the interests of the people; not be content with the status quo, not stick to conventions, but muster revolutionary zeal and strive for advancement; not be empty and floating, but earnestly and practically go deep into work; not be passively dependent, but dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to take responsibility. It is necessary to advocate among women's federation cadres comparing revolutionary zeal, comparing studying business, comparing running experimental fields, comparing learning, comparing hard work style, and comparing working methods.

During the meeting, the women's federations of Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces (autonomous region), in order to exchange work experience and improve together, also reached a work collaboration agreement.

The meeting was presided over by Zhang Yun, vice chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and Cao Guanqun, secretary of the Secretariat. Zhang Yun also made a speech at the meeting.

    要敢想、敢说、敢做、敢负责
    七省妇女工作座谈会号召妇联干部力争上游
    新华社武汉18日电　全国妇联6日到13日在武汉召开了广西、广东、江西、河南、陕西、湖北、湖南七个省（自治区）的妇女工作座谈会。参加会议的有省、自治区妇联主任、宣传干部和部分专（市）、县妇联主任共四十多人。
    去冬今春以来，妇女群众的革命干劲空前高涨，在生产战线上起了巨大作用。其特点是：出勤率高、出勤经常、劳动范围广、劳动力安排得好、妇女群众钻劲大、革新精神好、勇于克服困难。会议上的材料说明，妇女出勤一般占妇女劳动力的90％以上，许多地区已达100％。妇女全年一般能做一百五十到二百个劳动日。许多地区男子去兴修大型水利工程后，积肥、农田管理、兴修小型水利、植树造林、副业生产等任务，大部由妇女承担。广西僮族自治区宁明县，犁田一向是由男子担当，但今春因男子出工兴修水利，为了抢上春耕季节，就有一万一千多名妇女学会了使用五三步犁和双轮双铧犁，承担了春播任务。妇女们在治山治水方面也大显身手，仅河南禹县就有四万三千多名妇女投入治山治水工程，她们除与男农民一起完成了九百一十三个山头的治理工程外，还组织了五十九个妇女治山突击队，治理山头一百一十二处。妇女渠、妇女水库、三八果园、三八林、妇女高额丰产田、妇女创造的车子、农具、家具等，各省各县到处都有。妇女中还掀起了空前未有的学先进、比先进、赶先进的热潮，出现了成千上万的英雄模范和各种能手。社会上对妇女的观感和舆论也比过去有了很大不同。
    会议认为，随着妇女群众大跃进的形势，各地的妇女工作也程度不同地在跃进中。妇联干部干劲足，办法多，妇联组织活跃，促进作用显著，领导作风、干部作风也都有了显著的转变。当前妇女工作突出的任务就是要鼓舞和教育妇女勤学苦练、钻研技术，大胆创造革新，以便进一步提高劳动效能。提倡、支持妇女参加种试验田，是提高妇女技术的良好办法，同时还要大力注意发现先进和总结、表扬、推广先进，掀起一个学习技术，学习先进，创造大面积丰产的群众运动。陕西省推广了植棉能手、全国劳动模范张秋香的植棉技术后，关中地区三十一个县有五千三百多个妇女提出要学习张秋香，争取今年达到籽棉亩产千斤。湖北等省由于大力宣传了妇女中的高额丰产典型，也出现了成百上千个争取高额丰产的棉花姑娘、花生姑娘、蚕娘子、水稻姑娘等。此外，还要动员妇女参加文化技术夜校、技术训练班或其他学习文化技术的活动，并建议有关部门有计划地培养一批女的农业科学技术人员。
    会议认为，各级妇联组织必须彻底转变领导作风，认真作到深入实际、深入生产、深入群众。专区以上妇联干部，除老、弱、有病的人外，每年至少应有四个月的时间深入基层。各级妇联干部都应办试验田或根据办试验田的精神搞业务的试验点。湖南宁乡县妇联干部除办试验田外，每人还学会一门生产技术，实现了干部的专业化，这对妇联干部争取又红又专极有意义。专区以上的妇联组织，凡能在下边开的会议，一律到下边去开。按照湖北红安、湖南宁乡县的经验，县妇联机关搬到重点乡办公，更便于密切联系群众，及时发现问题、解决问题，也是值得普遍推行的好办法。参加会议的人还一致认为，妇联干部必须不断与“五气”作斗争，不要心胸狭隘，计较个人利益，要有社会主义觉悟，一切从人民利益出发；不要安于现状，墨守陈规，要鼓足革命干劲，力争上游；不要空洞漂浮，要切切实实深入工作；不要消极依赖，要敢想、敢说、敢做、敢负责。要在妇联干部中提倡比革命干劲、比钻研业务、比办试验田、比学习、比艰苦作风、比工作方法。
    在会议进行过程中，广西、广东、江西、湖北、湖南五个省（自治区）的妇联，为了互相交流工作经验，共同提高，还达成了一项工作协作协议。
    这次会议由全国妇联副主席章蕴、书记处书记曹冠群主持，章蕴并在会上作了讲话。
