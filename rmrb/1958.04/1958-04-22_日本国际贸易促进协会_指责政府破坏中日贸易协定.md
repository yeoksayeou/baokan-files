    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 21st: The Japan International Trade Promotion Association's National Committee passed a statement today at an emergency meeting held in Tokyo, accusing the Japanese government of losing its autonomous stance and openly making unfriendly statements and actions towards China, thereby undermining the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

    The statement demanded that the Japanese government immediately rescind its reply to the three Japan-China trade groups and provide full support and assistance for the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement in a spirit of friendship. The statement pointed out that the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, which was warmly welcomed by the Japanese business community and the general public, was concluded more than a month ago. However, the Japanese government has not yet expressed full agreement and guarantee for the implementation of this agreement, which violates the wishes of the Japanese business community and is an act of bad faith towards China.

    The Japan International Trade Promotion Association's National Committee also decided to convene a national manufacturers' conference in conjunction with other relevant trade groups and launch a large-scale national movement before the Japanese general election to urge the Japanese government to immediately give full agreement to the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

    指责政府破坏中日贸易协定
    新华社21日讯东京消息：日本国际贸易促进协会全国委员会今天在东京举行的临时紧急会议上通过一项声明，指责日本政府丧失自主态度，公然对中国作出不友好的言行，破坏第四次中日贸易协定的实施。
    声明要求日本政府立即取消它给日中贸易三团体的答复，并且根据友好的精神对第四次中日贸易协定的实施给予全面的支持和协助。声明指出，受到日本贸易界和广大人民热烈欢迎的第四次中日贸易协定已经缔结了一个多月，但是，日本政府对实施这个协定至今没有表示全面的同意和保证，这是违背日本贸易界的愿望的，也是对中国的一种不守国际信义的行为。
    日本国际贸易促进协会全国委员会还决定在日本举行大选以前，联合其他有关贸易团体召开全国厂商大会以及展开声势浩大的国民运动，来促使日本政府立即对第四次中日贸易协定的执行给予全面的同意。
