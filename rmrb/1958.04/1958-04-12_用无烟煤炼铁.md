    Iron Smelting with Anthracite Coal

    (Reported by this newspaper) The local iron industry production cooperative in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, has successfully used anthracite coal to smelt iron in indigenous blast furnaces, overcoming the conservative thinking that iron cannot be smelted without coke.

    This bold innovation has significantly increased production. In the past, traditional square furnaces produced 0.527 tons of iron per furnace per day. Now, each indigenous blast furnace using anthracite coal produces 1.25 tons per day. If the annual production days are calculated at 306 days, each indigenous blast furnace can produce an additional 208 tons of pig iron for the country annually. The quality of the iron smelted with anthracite coal is greatly improved compared to the past. The iron is purer, and castings have no sand holes or small voids, fully meeting the local first-class standard for pig iron. The average cost per ton of iron has also decreased by 28.93% compared to before.

    Smelting iron with anthracite coal in indigenous blast furnaces is very economical, requiring little investment and yielding quick results. Establishing an indigenous blast furnace with a daily output of 1.5 tons and a height of 5 meters only requires an investment of about 400 yuan (excluding power and blowers). The technical operation is simple. After a short period of learning, mastering the proportion of ingredients, loading the furnace, and smelting operation techniques (watching the furnace), smelting work can be carried out independently.

    用无烟煤炼铁
    本报讯　山西阳城县应朝铁业生产合作社土高炉试用无烟煤炼铁成功，克服了历来认为没有焦炭就不能炼铁的保守思想。
    这一大胆的创造，使生产量显著提高。过去方炉土法炼铁每炉日产生铁量零点五二七吨，现在每一土高炉无烟煤炼铁日产量达一点二五吨。如每年生产日期按三百零六天计算，每一土高炉全年可为国家多增产二百零八吨生铁。用无烟煤炼的铁，质量较前大大提高，铁质纯净，铸铁没有沙眼和小空，完全合乎本地生铁的一等标准。每吨铁的平均成本也比以前降低了28.93％。
    土高炉无烟煤炼铁很经济，投资少，收效快。建立一个日产一点五吨、五公尺高的土高炉仅需投资四百元左右（不包括动力和鼓风机）。技术操作简单，只要经过较短的时间学习，掌握住配料的比例、装炉和冶炼操作技术（看炉），即可单独进行冶炼工作。　		（杨长贵）
