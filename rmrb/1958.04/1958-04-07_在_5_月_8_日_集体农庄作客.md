Visiting the "May 8th" Collective Farm
Wang Qi

The "May 8th" Collective Farm is a small village in Cobadin Commune, Constanța Region, Romania. In the past, you couldn't find it on any map; people had forgotten it. Now, it shines like the early morning sun.

Dusk was approaching, but the farm chairman, Shabri Emra, and the visiting Chinese guests were still reluctant to leave the pigsty, watching the keeper drive the plump pigs into the pig house.

Shabri Emra stroked the sows struggling in the throes of pre-natal pain, predicting that soon each farm member would have two more piglets. The farm has fifty sows, producing eight to nine hundred piglets each year, with output increasing year by year.

The farm chairman told us that the farm had built three wheat warehouses, each with a capacity of 800 tons, and two corn warehouses, each capable of holding 250 tons. I looked in the direction pointed by Comrade Shabri Emra, and in the distance, the outline of newly erected frames was vaguely visible. The farm chairman said:

"Those are even bigger new warehouses!"

The "May 8th" Collective Farm is one of the fifty-nine collective farms in Constanța Region's first collectivized county, Cobadin. In addition to Romanians, there are also Tatar, Turkish, and Greek minorities, accounting for more than half of the village's population. Shabri Emra, a Tatar farmer who has been re-elected as the farm chairman for seven consecutive years.

Capitalists, landlords, and bureaucrats were determined to keep this place in poverty, backwardness, and darkness forever. We visited a rural church. In the church, there was a painting: a gaunt farmer plowing the land with an old ox, with a pile of raging fire burning the farmer. The comrade who explained told us that the meaning of the painting was that if farmers wanted to change their environment, they would go to hell and be punished by God. Now, farmers living a prosperous life always say humorously when talking about their past lives: "At that time, no one cared about us, only God cared about us."

Now, it is difficult to describe the current life of the members of the "May 8th" Collective Farm in a single sentence. Seven springs have passed since the birth of this farm, and each spring is different. This farm, which includes 518 households and owns 3,200 hectares of land, had only 37,000 lei in funds in 1951; by the end of 1956, it had increased to 1.78 million lei. With the continuous growth of the farm, the remuneration for each work day continues to increase. In 1952, the average remuneration per work day was only 28 lei, while in 1957 it reached 50 to 70 lei.

Speaking of what property the farm has increased, no one remembers it as clearly as the farm chairman. He remembers the number of all properties as familiarly as he knows his ten fingers. He doesn't need to look at a notebook or think when he tells me any number. I ask, and he answers. When he talks about the farm, his eyes sparkle with happiness.

Shabri Emra was originally a poor peasant. Before liberation, he only had a few acres of land that did not grow crops. Speaking of this, the farm chairman lowered his head. I saw a strand of white hair on his temples, and also saw wrinkles that were completely inconsistent with his happy eyes. The farm chairman is only thirty-seven or eight years old. The difficult years of the past took away his youth, but did not take away his steel-like will. Before the multi-ethnic village established a collective farm, he and seven poor peasants organized a cooperative group. He served as the leader of the group and persisted until the establishment of the collective farm in 1951.

When I asked him about the situation when he started organizing the cooperative group, he said:

"Why did I do that? Life told me, the Party told me." At this time, I remembered that this farm was named after the date of the founding of the Romanian Communist Party.

Speaking of his family, his pleasant expression is just like when talking about his farm. He smiled, smiled so naturally! He immediately took out a photo from his coat pocket and showed it to me. This is a photo of his whole family. He is wearing a suit, his wife is wearing a black long dress, they are sitting side by side, with a boy and a girl leaning on their knees. He said softly to the photo:

"It's a pity! She can't meet Chinese friends this time." He told me that his wife had gone on a trip to another place and was also visiting the Dovdana Museum, and would not be back for a short time. He also invited me to his home.

As soon as I stepped into the home of the collective farm chairman, a little girl with curly hair and black eyes ran out of the room on the right. She slowly approached us and put her chubby little hand on my neck. I recognized her, she is the little girl in the photo who looks just like her mother. Her name is Meleike. At the door of the room on the left, stood a young woman, her dress completely in the Bucharest style, she was smiling at us. The farm chairman introduced us:

"This is the land organization engineer sent by the Ministry of Agriculture, temporarily living in our home."

The farm chairman led us into the room on the right where he lived. This room is actually two rooms, with a door in the middle. In the outer room, there was a table by the window, with a radio on the table, and a clock on the radio. In the outer room, there are also two sofas the size of beds. In addition to the embroidered pillows unique to the Tatar people, the sofas are covered with animal skins, which shows the diligence and bravery of the owner. Before I could browse all the things in this room, the farm chairman's niece came with a plate of candies. She let everyone eat a piece of candy, and then drink a full glass of wine. This is the custom of the Tatar people.

The female engineer also came over from the opposite room. Perhaps she saw that we did not understand the term "land organization," she brought a large design drawing. The agronomist of the "May 8th" Collective Farm was a classmate of the female engineer from a university in Bucharest, and also helped her explain.

From that design drawing, Cobadin Commune will definitely be built like a new city in a few years. The female engineer said that this design drawing is to tell people that building livestock sheds, building warehouses, and planting trees now should not hinder future development. The farm chairman said that in these seven years, they have built three cattle houses, nine pig houses, two sheep houses, and five warehouses; and also built carpentry shops, iron workshops, and brick and tile factories. Seventy-three farm members have moved into new houses. How to ensure that these are all organized reasonably? Of course, a land organization engineer is needed to design it.

Not only was the female engineer who was explaining excited, but the listeners were also very excited. The female engineer drew a large circle on the map, as if saying: How wonderful it would be if all this were realized!

Someone interjected, "In the future, we will also plant linden trees on both sides of the road. Strolling on our streets will be like strolling on the streets of Bucharest."

Everyone talked lively, how attractive the wonderful plans for the future are!

It was very late when we left the farm chairman's house. When we walked on the street, what we saw seemed not to be dirt roads or the current houses, but asphalt roads with shady green trees on both sides, and tall buildings with bright colors.

I thanked the farm chairman again. He not only made me see the new life they created, but also saw the more beautiful life that is approaching day by day.

The "May 8th" Collective Farm, maybe it still cannot be found on the map now, but the whole of Romania knows this place. It is the first collectivized village. After it, hundreds and thousands of collective farms have appeared in Romania. Looking at the changes in the Romanian countryside from the "May 8th" Collective Farm is like looking at the sun from a drop of dew.

### 在“5月8日”集体农庄作客

    在“5月8日”集体农庄作客
    汪琦
    “5月8日”集体农庄，是罗马尼亚?格鲁沃达县阁巴亭乡的一个小村庄。过去，不管从哪一本地图上都找不到它，人们把它遗忘了。现在，它却像早霞一样光芒万丈。
    黄昏已经临近了，农庄主席沙勃利·爱姆拉和来访问的中国客人，还恋恋不舍地站在猪圈旁边，看着饲养员把那些浑圆的猪赶到猪房里去。
    沙勃利·爱姆拉抚摸着那些在产前的痛苦中挣扎的母猪，他预测不久以后每个庄员又可以有两只小猪，这个农庄有五十只母猪，每年生产八百到九百只小猪，产量一年比一年提高。
    农庄主席告诉我们：农庄已经盖了三个麦子仓库，各容八百吨；两个玉米仓库，每个能装二百五十吨。我顺着沙勃利·爱姆拉同志的手指的方向望过去，在稍远的地方，新竖起的房架子的轮廓隐约可见。农庄主席说：
    “那是更大的新的仓库！”
    “5月8日”集体农庄，是康斯坦萨州第一个合作化的县——?格鲁沃达县的五十九个集体农庄之一。除了罗马尼亚族的人以外，还有占全村人口一半以上的鞑靼、土耳其和希腊等少数民族。七年来连选连任农庄主席的沙勃利·爱姆拉，就是一个鞑靼族的农民。
    资本家、地主和官僚们存心要让贫穷，落后和黑暗永远占据这个地方。我们曾经参观了一个农村教堂。教堂里有一幅画：一个骨瘦如柴的农民，正在架着一条老牛在耕地，旁边有一堆烈火在燃烧这个农民。解释的同志告诉我们，这幅画的意思是说，如果农民想改变改变自己的环境，就要入地狱，受上帝惩罚。现在，过着富裕生活的农民，谈起过去的生活，总是很幽默地说：“那时谁也不管我们，就是上帝管着我们。”
    现在，要想一下说出“5月8日”集体农庄庄员现在的生活，那是困难的。这个农庄诞生以来，已经过了七个春天，每个春天都是不同的。这个包括了五百一十八户、拥有三千二百公顷土地的农庄，在1951年，只有基金三万七千列伊；1956年底，已经增加到一百七十八万列伊。随着农庄的不断壮大，每个劳动日的报酬不断提高。1952年平均每个劳动日只有二十八列伊，而1957年达到五十到七十列伊。
    说到这个农庄增加了什么家产，谁也没有农庄主席记得清楚。他记得所有财产的数目，就像他对十个指头一样熟悉。他告诉我任何数字的时候，完全不用看笔记本，也不用想。我问到哪里，他答到哪里。一谈到农庄，他的眼里就闪耀着幸福的光芒。
    沙勃利·爱姆拉原是一个贫农。解放以前，只有几亩不长粮食的土地。说到这儿，农庄主席的头低下了。我看见了他鬓边的一束白发，也看见了那和他的快乐的眼睛完全不相称的皱纹、农庄主席才三十七、八岁，过去艰难的岁月，夺去了他的青年时代，却没有夺去他的钢一样的意志。在这个多民族的小村子还没有成立集体农庄以前，他和七个贫农组织了一个合作小组，他当小组长，一直坚持到1951年成立集体农庄的时候。
    当我问到他开始组织合作小组情形的时候，他说：
    “我为什么要那样做呢？那是生活告诉我的，党告诉我的。”这时，我才想起这个农庄，是用罗马尼亚共产党诞生的日子命名的。
    谈到他的家庭，他的愉快神情，就像谈到他的农庄一样。他笑了，笑得那样自然！他马上从上衣口袋里拿出一张照片给我看。这是他全家的照片。他穿着西装，他妻子穿着黑色长裙，他俩并排坐在一起，男孩和女孩靠在他们膝前，他对着照片轻轻地说：
    “真可惜！她这次不能同中国朋友见面了。”他告诉我，他的妻子到外地旅行去了，还要参观多夫当那博物馆，短时间回不来。他又邀我到他家里去。
    我刚一跨进集体农庄主席的家门，就从右边房间里跑出一个卷发黑眼睛的小姑娘。她慢慢地靠近我们，把胖胖的小手伸到我的脖子上，我认识她了，她就是照片上那个酷似母亲的小女孩，她叫梅莱凯。左边房间的门口，站着一个年青的女人，她的装束完全是布加勒斯特式的，她正在对着我们笑，农庄主席为我们介绍说：
    “这是农业部派来的土地组织工程师，暂住我们家里。”
    农庄主席把我们引进右边他住的房间，这个房间其实是两间，中间有一个门。外间靠窗户放了一张桌子，桌子上有收音机，收音机上放了一个座钟。外间里，还有两个像床一样大小的沙发，除了鞑靼人所特有的挑花靠枕以外，沙发上铺了一张兽皮，这说明主人的勤劳和勇敢，没等我把这间房子里的东西都浏览一遍，农庄主席的侄女托着一盘糖走来了，她让每个人吃一块糖，而后满满地喝一杯酒。这是鞑靼族的习惯。
    女工程师也从对面房间走过来，她也许是看出了我们不懂“土地组织”这个名词，她拿了一大张很大的设计图来了。“5月8日”集体农庄的农艺师，是女工程师的布加勒斯特一个大学的同学，也帮助她解释。
    从那张设计图上看，这个阁巴亭乡不要几年以后，一定会像一个新的城市一样建设起来。女工程师说，这张设计图就是要告诉人们：现在盖饲畜舍，造仓库，种树，不要妨碍将来的发展，农庄主席说，在这七年中，他们已经盖了三个牛房，九个猪房，两个羊房，五个仓库；还建设了木工场、铁工场和砖瓦厂。有七十三个庄员住进了新房子。怎样保证这些都组织得很合理呢？当然需要土地组织工程师来设计一番。
    不仅解释的女工程师很兴奋，听的人也很兴奋。女工程师用手在图上画了一个大圆圈，好像是说：这一切都实现了，该有多么好！
    有人插嘴说：“将来我们也在马路两边栽上菩提树。在我们的街上散步，也像在布加勒斯特大街上散步一样。”
    大家谈得很热闹，未来的美妙的计划多么吸引人啊！
    很晚，我们才离开农庄主席的家，我们走到街上，这时，我们看到的好像不是泥土的道路，也不是现在的房子，而是两旁绿树成荫的柏油马路，颜色鲜明的高大楼房。
    我再一次感谢农庄主席，他不仅使我看见了他们所创立的新生活，也看见了那一天比一天迫近的更加美好的生活。
    “5月8日”集体农庄，也许现在从地图上还是找不着它，可是，罗马尼亚全国都知道这个地方。它是第一个集体化的村庄。在它以后，罗马尼亚又出现了成百成千的集体农庄。从“5月8日”集体农庄看罗马尼亚的农村变化，就像从一颗露珠看太阳一样。
