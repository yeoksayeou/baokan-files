Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 5th: The National Youth Workers' Representative Conference opened in Shanghai today.

    Xu Zhizhen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in his opening speech: This conference will introduce the experiences of young workers in accepting socialist education and carrying out ideological transformation, the experiences of young workers in launching a great leap forward in production on the basis of a great leap forward in ideology, the experiences of older workers in helping young workers carry out ideological transformation, and the experiences of trade unions and the Communist Youth League organizations in carrying out ideological and political education and organizing a great leap forward in production among young workers.
    568 young worker representatives from all over the country attended the meeting, and 350 Shanghai young workers attended as observers. Many well-known veteran workers were also invited to participate in the meeting.
    At 9:00 a.m., Executive Chairman Xu Zhizhen announced the opening of the meeting. Xu Zhizhen said: Young workers account for a large proportion of our country's employees. They are a new force in our country's working class and a shock force in our country's socialist construction. They have played and are playing a huge role in our country's socialist construction. Young workers now shoulder the arduous tasks of socialist construction, and in the future, they will also complete the tasks of socialist and communist construction together with the people of the whole country. This requires young workers to effectively strengthen their political and ideological training and constantly master new production technologies. At present, it is particularly necessary to strengthen ideological transformation among young workers. Only with a great leap forward in ideology can there be a great leap forward in production and construction. Therefore, it is of great significance to summarize and promote the experience of young workers in accepting socialist education in the rectification movement through this conference.
    Xu Zhizhen said: We firmly believe that under the leadership and cultivation of the Chinese Communist Party, young workers will surely be able to forge themselves into conscious, organized, and disciplined working-class fighters. Young workers will unite closely with veteran workers and engineering and technical personnel, use unparalleled revolutionary drive, and continuously innovate technologies so that our country can catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or a little more, making our country a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.
    Xu Zhizhen said that it is of great significance that this conference is being held in Shanghai. Shanghai is one of the birthplaces of the Chinese workers' movement and the cradle of our revolution. Our predecessors carried out long-term and unremitting heroic struggles here for the liberation of the people of the whole country and the liberation of the working class. We must learn from the spirit of bravery, diligence, and selflessness of our predecessors, learn from their noble qualities of sacrificing everything for the ideal of realizing communism, and take on the historical task of building socialism and communism.
    After Xu Zhizhen delivered the opening speech, Zhong Min, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Ajiu, an old worker from Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 9, Liu Guangyao, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation, Huang Fuqin, Secretary of the Communist Youth League General Branch of the Second Branch of the Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in the Western Suburbs of Shanghai, and Li Qitao, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered speeches successively. In his speech, Zhong Min gave a detailed introduction to the outstanding production achievements and ideological leaps recently created by 1.6 million employees in Shanghai, especially young workers, in various aspects. Old worker Liu Ajiu guaranteed on behalf of the old workers: to teach all the old workers' sense of ownership of the working class and production technology to the young workers, and to learn from each other and study together with the young workers to achieve a great turnaround in technology. Li Qitao said in his speech that in the past 20 days, young workers in the city have contributed more than 280,000 gifts of new production achievements for the conference, more than 600 machine tools made from waste materials, and more than 3,000 tons of scrap steel. Innovations and miracles are emerging like mushrooms after a rain, and the seeds of technological revolution among young people have already appeared.
    After the speeches, more than 2,000 young workers in Shanghai carried various charts and physical objects with production achievements written on them to present gifts to the conference. The conference held a plenary session in the afternoon.
    In the evening, the national youth worker representatives visited the gifts and several exhibitions presented to the conference by Shanghai youth workers at the Shanghai Youth Palace and had a get-together with Shanghai youth workers. The youth worker representatives received a profound class education at a "Three Prosperities" exhibition. This exhibition displayed many pictures and objects of the process of three Shanghai young workers, Gu Liufa, Yang Changfa, and Yang Zhaofa, being eroded by bourgeois ideology and forgetting their roots, from progress to backwardness, and from backwardness to progress. Gu Liufa and others personally explained to the youth worker representatives the process of their ideological degeneration and being rescued by the Party. The representatives also saw an article written by Wang Weiguang, Director of the Shanghai Boiler Factory. The article said that when Wang Weiguang met Chairman Mao on September 17 last year, he reported to Chairman Mao that Gu Liufa had forgotten his roots and posted a big-character poster saying "Wasted effort" (i.e., workers' sweat did not get benefits). Chairman Mao then instructed: "Young workers have not suffered the bitterness of the old society, so they should strengthen class education and raise their class consciousness." After that, the factory carried out a lot of education for Gu Liufa, and Gu Liufa finally woke up. Now he and Yang Changfa and Yang Zhaofa are engaged in socialist competition. Many youth worker representatives said gratefully, how much Chairman Mao cares about us young workers, we must work hard to improve our class consciousness.

    把自己锻炼成有觉悟有纪律有技术的工人阶级战士！
    全国青年工人代表会议开幕
    据新华社上海5日电　全国青年工人代表会议今天在上海开幕。
    中华全国总工会副主席许之桢在开幕词中说：这次会议将要介绍青年工人接受社会主义教育、进行思想改造的经验，介绍青年工人在思想大跃进的基础上开展生产大跃进的经验，介绍老年工人帮助青年工人进行思想改造的经验，介绍工会和共青团组织在青年工人中进行思想政治教育和组织生产大跃进方面的经验。
    出席会议的有来自全国各地的青年工人代表五百六十八人，列席会议的上海青年工人有三百五十人。许多知名的老年工人也应邀参加了会议。
    上午九时，执行主席许之桢宣布会议开幕，许之桢说：青年工人在我国职工中占很大比重，是我国工人阶级的新生力量，也是我国社会主义建设的突击队，在我国的社会主义建设中已经起了并且正在起着巨大的作用。青年工人现在担负着社会主义建设的艰巨任务，将来，还要和全国人民一道来完成社会主义和共产主义的建设任务。这就要求青年工人切实地加强政治思想锻炼，不断地掌握新的生产技术。目前特别要加强青年工人中的思想改造，只有思想上的大跃进，才能有生产建设上的大跃进。因此，通过这次会议，总结和推广青年工人在整风运动中接受社会主义教育的经验有很大的意义。
    许之桢说：我们深信，在中国共产党的领导和培养下，青年工人一定能够把自己锻炼成为一个有觉悟、有组织、有纪律的工人阶级战士。青年工人将和老工人、工程技术人员紧密团结在一起，以无比的革命干劲，加上不断地革新技术，使我国在钢铁及其他主要工业生产品方面，在十五年或者更多一点的时间内赶上或者超过英国，使我国成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
    许之桢说，这次会议在上海召开是有很大意义的。上海是我国工人运动的发源地之一，是我们革命的摇篮。我们的先辈，为了全国人民的解放事业和工人阶级的解放事业，曾在这里进行过长期不懈的英勇斗争。我们要学习先辈勇敢勤劳、大公无私的精神，学习他们的为实现共产主义的理想而牺牲一切的崇高品质，把建设社会主义和共产主义的历史任务担当起来。
    许之桢致开幕词后，上海市工会联合会主席锺民、上海国棉九厂老工人刘阿九、上海市妇女联合会副主任刘光耀、上海市西郊区红星农业社第二分社共青团总支书记黄富琴、共青团上海市委书记李琦涛等先后致词。锺民在致词中详细介绍了上海一百六十万职工特别是青年工人最近所创造的各方面的出色的生产成就和思想上的跃进。老工人刘阿九在会上代表老工人提出保证：把老工人的工人阶级主人翁思想、生产的技术全部教给青工，并且和青工相互学习，一起钻研，在技术上来个大翻身。李琦涛在讲话中说，最近二十天来，全市青工为会议献出的生产新成绩的礼品已有二十八万多件，用废料制成的机床有六百多台，收集的废钢铁有三千多吨，创举和奇迹多如雨后春笋，青年中的技术革命的萌芽已经出现。
    致词完毕后，上海市两千多青年工人抬着各种各样写着生产成就的图表和实物，向会议献礼。会议在下午进行了大会发言。
    晚上，全国青年工人代表到上海青年宫参观了上海青年工人献给会议的礼品和几个展览会，并且和上海青年工人联欢。青工代表们在一个“三法（发）”展览会上受到了深刻的阶级教育。这个展览会陈列的上海三个青年工人顾六法、羊长发、杨照发受资产阶级思想侵蚀而忘本，由进步到落后，由落后到进步的过程的许多图片和实物。顾六法等都亲自向青工代表们讲解自己思想堕落和受到党挽救的经过。代表们还看到上海锅炉厂厂长王伟光写的一篇文章。文章里说，王伟光在去年9月17日见到毛主席时，曾向毛主席汇报了顾六法忘本，贴出一张“白费牛马之力”（即工人流汗得不到好处）的大字报，毛主席当时指示说：“青年工人没有受过旧社会的苦，更应　加强阶级教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟。”以后厂里对顾六法进行了许多教育，顾六法终于觉悟过来，现在他和羊、杨二人正在进行社会主义竞赛。许多青工代表都感激地说，毛主席是多么关心我们青年工人，我们一定要努力提高阶级觉悟。
