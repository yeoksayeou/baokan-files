    Achievements of Sino-Romanian Cultural Cooperation
    Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Zhang Xiruo

    If we look back at the cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Romania over the past few years, we will come to a satisfactory conclusion: this exchange and cooperation is developing extensively and deeply; it has promoted mutual understanding between the two peoples, strengthened the friendship between the two peoples, brought inspiring power to their respective national cultures, and contributed to consolidating world peace.

    The cultural exchange and cooperation between China and Romania, like the cultural exchange and cooperation between all socialist countries, is not only based on the common interests and common aspirations of the two peoples, but also receives full care and support from the governments of the two countries. The Chinese and Romanian governments signed the "Sino-Romanian Cultural Cooperation Agreement" in 1951, and subsequently signed the "Sino-Romanian Broadcasting Cooperation Agreement" and the "Sino-Romanian Film Exchange and Newsreel Footage Exchange Contract." These agreements guarantee extensive cooperation between China and Romania in all aspects of science and culture.

    In recent years, literary and art workers from China and Romania have made important contributions to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. Mutual visits by writers, artists, journalists and various art troupes are a good way to promote the understanding of each other's excellent cultural traditions and spiritual life among the broad masses of the two countries. Romania sent the Army Cultural Troupe, folk band, and the "Skylark" Folk Song and Dance Troupe to China for friendly visits and performances. The Romanian Army Cultural Troupe performed 24 shows in eleven major cities in China, with an audience of more than 400,000 people, leaving a beautiful impression on Chinese audiences. Their moving dances and songs showed the infinite beauty of Romanian folk art. They also learned Chinese songs such as "The East is Red" and "People All Over the World Are of One Heart." They sang with clear rhythm and clear pronunciation, which made us feel very kind. The "Skylark" Folk Song and Dance Troupe was the foreign performing group that toured China for the longest time and had the most performances. The programs they performed were rich and distinctly national in character, truly reflecting the labor and new life of the Romanian people. During their busy performances, they also took some time to exchange experiences with literary and art circles in various parts of China, and achieved good results. Now they have become tireless warriors in promoting the glorious victories of the Chinese people. The operas, Peking operas, acrobatics, songs and dances performed by various art troupes sent by China to Romania were warmly welcomed and appreciated by Romanian audiences. In particular, the opera "The White-Haired Girl" left an indelible impression on the audience. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, which went to Romania for a friendly performance in 1954, had extensive contact in Romania and achieved good political results. The Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic awarded the personnel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe with the Romanian Republic Star Medal of the first to fifth classes. This lofty honor has always encouraged them to work hard to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples.

    The creative labor of writers to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples is also very touching. For example, seven writers including G. Galan-Francu, who were sent by Romania to visit China from 1951 to 1956, wrote books introducing the situation in China after returning to their country, which had a profound impact on the Romanian people. What makes us particularly honored is that Dr. Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of Romania, wrote a reportage literature of about 300,000 words, "The Country of 600 Million People," which played a great role in further understanding the new China by the Romanian people and enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples. Chinese writers Feng Zhi, Tian Jian, Zeng Ke, and Zheng Boqi also wrote short stories, essays, and news reports after visiting Romania and returning to China. During their visits to Romania, Chinese painters Fu Baoshi and Yang Taiyang, Romanian painters Markwei and Lobo Bella, and others portrayed the labor, life, and kindness of the people of the two countries and their unforgettable beautiful scenery with their brushes during their visits to China. Their works were welcomed by the people of the two countries, aroused great interest in the art circles of the two countries, and received good evaluation.

    China and Romania have also held exhibitions of each other's countries. Each exhibition has a specific theme, and the masses contacted by this kind of exhibition are very broad, and the effect is good. In 1957, the two exhibitions exhibited by Romania in China were visited by more than 197,000 people. Various special exhibitions sent by China have also been cherished and valued by Romanian audiences.

    China and Romania have also adopted various methods to carry out cultural exchanges. Translating and publishing each other's books is a regular task between the publishing departments of the two countries. In recent years, China has translated and published 62 Romanian books on politics, economics, literature, art, science and technology, with more than 780,000 copies printed, including the famous Romanian playwright Caragiale's "Lost Letter," the novelist Sadoveanu's "Mitrea Cocor," Dumitriu's "June Night," and Barang's "Scum," etc. Romania has also translated and published more than 50 kinds of Chinese works. Many of Chairman Mao Zedong's creations have been translated into Romanian and published, including "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "On Practice" and "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." Hu Qiaomu's "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China" has also been published. In order to meet the Romanian people's demand for reading Chinese literary works, Romania has also translated and published the works of famous Chinese writers, including Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q," Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane," Cao Ming's "The Motivator," Zhao Shuli's "Family Treasure," and Liu Baiyu's "Invincible Three Warriors," etc.

    Performing each other's famous dramas is also a good way to introduce each other's excellent national culture. In recent years, Romania has performed Chinese operas and dramas "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," "The West Chamber," "Growing Up in Battle," and is preparing to perform other famous Chinese dramas. China has performed the Romanian drama "The Destroyed Fortress," and is preparing to perform the famous classical playwright Caragiale's "Lost Letter" this year.

    The exchange of Sino-Romanian films has brought many artistic and patriotic works to the film circles of our two countries. Romanian films such as "Espionage on the Border," "For a Better Life," and "Ideals Realized" have been praised by the vast Chinese audience. The film "Espionage on the Border" has been watched by 6 million people. Chinese films such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Daughter of China," "Zhao Yiman" and "Red Flag on Cui Gang" have also left unforgettable impressions on Romanian audiences. Among them, the film "The White-Haired Girl" has been watched by more than 2 million people. In addition, the two sides have also held film weeks.

    Scientific cooperation between China and Romania plays an important role in developing each other's scientific research work and helping each other's socialist economic construction. In science, Romania has provided more assistance to China than China has provided to Romania. Romania has sent famous scientists to China to visit, lecture and exchange experiences. Such as Academician Carari, an expert in aeronautical mechanics, Academician Nicolae, a virologist, and Academician Nasda, an expert in tuberculosis. Academician Nicolae, a Romanian authority on virology, visited China twice in 1954 and 1955 to lecture, which greatly helped China's virology research, teaching, clinical and prevention work. The three Romanian agronomists who came to China for investigation in 1956 inspected China's breeding, cultivation and fertilization techniques and rice growth and high-yield experience in 28 agricultural science and farmland water conservancy research institutions, agricultural colleges and farms in Hebei Province, China, and believed that these experiences could be used for reference in Romania. The experience of diversified management of China's agricultural cooperatives, full utilization of land and labor, and continuous farming in all seasons was valued by them.

    Sending students to each other is one of the ways to learn each other's scientific and cultural achievements. The first students sent by both sides have now returned to their motherlands and devoted themselves to the economic and cultural construction of their motherlands and the glorious cause of enhancing Sino-Romanian friendship. At the same time, with the increase of students and the establishment of each other's language classes, the number of people who understand each other's languages is increasing day by day, which is undoubtedly a great convenience for further communicating the scientific and cultural links between the two countries and strengthening the deep friendship between the two peoples.

    Everyone knows that Romania's table tennis is the most prestigious internationally. In 1957, a Chinese table tennis team of 12 people went to Romania for training for a month. Under the patient guidance of Romanian experts, the Chinese table tennis team has greatly improved its skills.

    The friendly visit to China by the Romanian government delegation headed by Romanian Council of Ministers Chairman Chivu Stoica marks a new development in Sino-Romanian friendly relations. At this time, we review the achievements of Sino-Romanian cultural cooperation in the past few years, and we feel particularly excited and full of confidence in the further development of Sino-Romanian cultural cooperation. Because the friendly relations and cooperation between China and Romania are linked by the common ideology of building socialism, further cultural cooperation will naturally help strengthen the fraternal friendship between China and Romania, help the socialist construction of China and Romania, and help defend the sacred cause of world peace.

### 中罗文化合作的成就

    中罗文化合作的成就	对外文化联络委员会主任　张奚若
    假如我们回顾一下几年来中罗两国的文化交流和合作的情况，我们会得出一个满意的结论：这种交流和合作在广泛深入地发展着；它促进了两国人民之间的相互了解，加强了两国人民之间的友谊，给各自的民族文化带来了鼓舞的力量，并在巩固世界和平方面作出了贡献。
    中罗两国的文化交流和合作，同一切社会主义国家之间的文化交流和合作一样，不仅是建立在两国人民的共同利益和共同愿望的基础上，并得到两国政府的充分关怀和支持。中罗两国政府在1951年签订了“中罗文化合作协定”，此后又陆续签订了“中罗广播合作协定”和“中罗交换影片发行权和交换新闻片素材合同”。这些协定保证了中罗两国在科学文化各个方面进行广泛的合作。
    几年来，中罗两国的文学艺术工作者，在增进两国人民之间的相互了解和友谊方面，作出了重要的贡献。作家、美术家、新闻工作者和各种艺术团体的相互访问，是促进两国广大人民了解彼此的优秀文化传统和精神生活面貌的良好方式。罗马尼亚派遣了部队文工团、民间乐队和“云雀”民间歌舞团来我国作友好访问演出。罗马尼亚部队文工团在我国十一个大城市演出了二十四场，观众四十余万人，给我国观众留下了美好的印象。他们的动人的舞蹈和歌声显示出罗马尼亚民间艺术无限的优美。他们也学会了“东方红”和“全世界人民心一条”等中国歌曲。他们唱得节奏鲜明，吐字清楚，使我们感到非常亲切。“云雀”民间歌舞团是外国表演团在我国巡回演出时间最长和演出场次最多的一个。他们演出的节目都具有丰富的和鲜明的民族色彩，真实地反映了罗马尼亚人民的劳动和新生活。他们在繁忙的演出中，还抽出了一部分时间同我国各地文艺界交流了经验，并得到了良好的效果。现在他们已成为宣传中国人民辉煌胜利的不倦的战士。我国派到罗马尼亚的各种艺术团演出的歌剧、京剧、杂技和歌曲、舞蹈等节目都受到罗马尼亚观众满怀热情的欢迎和赞赏。尤其是歌剧“白毛女”给观众留下了不可磨灭的印象。1954年赴罗马尼亚作友好演出的中国人民解放军歌舞团在罗马尼亚接触很广，收到很好的政治效果。罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会以一级至五级的罗马尼亚共和国星勋章授给我人民解放军歌舞团人员。这种崇高的荣誉一直鼓舞着他们为加强中罗两国人民的友谊而努力。
    作家们为了增进中罗两国人民的相互了解和友谊所进行的创造性劳动，也是非常动人的。如1951年到1956年罗马尼亚派来我国访问的加兰·弗朗查等七位作家，回国后都写了介绍我国情况的书，在罗马尼亚人民中产生了深远的影响。特别使我们感到荣幸的是罗马尼亚大国民议会主席团主席格罗查博士写了约三十万字的报告文学“六亿人民的国度”一书，对罗马尼亚人民进一步了解新中国，增强中罗两国人民的友谊起了很大作用。中国作家冯至、田间、曾克、郑伯奇在访问罗马尼亚回国后，也都写了短篇小说、散文和通讯报道等。中国画家傅抱石、阳太阳在访问罗马尼亚期间，罗马尼亚画家马科威和落波·呗拉等在访问我国期间，都用他们的画笔刻画了两国人民的劳动、生活、善良的形象和他们所难忘的优美景物。他们的作品受到两国人民的欢迎，引起了两国美术界的很大兴趣，并得到很好的评价。
    中罗两国还互相举办了对方国家的展览会。每个展览会都有特定的专题，这种展览会所接触的群众面是很广的，效果是良好的。1957年罗马尼亚在我国展出的两个展览会，观众就已达到十九万七千多人次。我国送出的各种专题展览，也受到罗马尼亚观众的珍爱和重视。
    中罗两国还采取了各种各样的方式来进行文化交流。互相翻译出版对方的书籍，是两国出版部门之间的经常工作。几年来我国翻译出版了罗马尼亚的政治、经济、文学艺术和科学技术等书籍六十二种，印行了七十八万册以上，其中有罗马尼亚著名的剧作家卡拉基尔的“失去的信”，小说家萨多维亚努的“米特里亚·柯柯尔”、杜米屈里乌的“六月的夜”、巴琅格的“败类”等。罗马尼亚也翻译出版了五十多种中国的著作，毛泽东主席的许多创作先后译成罗文出版了，其中包括“毛泽东选集”、“实践论”和“论人民民主专政”等。胡乔木的“中国共产党的三十年”也出版了。为了满足罗马尼亚人民阅读中国文学著作的要求，罗马尼亚还翻译出版了中国著名作家们的作品，其中包括鲁迅的“阿Q正传”，周立波的“暴风骤雨”，草明的“原动力”，赵树理的“传家宝”和刘白羽的“无敌三勇士”等。
    互相上演对方的著名戏剧，也是介绍彼此的民族优秀文化的好方法。几年来罗马尼亚上演了我国的歌剧和话剧“王贵与李香香”、“西厢记”、“战斗里成长”，并准备上演我国其他著名话剧。我国上演了罗马尼亚话剧“摧毁的堡垒”，并且在今年准备上演著名的古典剧作家卡拉基尔的“失去的信”。
    中罗影片的交流，给我们两国的影坛带来了许多有艺术价值和爱国主义思想的作品。罗马尼亚影片“边塞擒谍”、“为了美好的生活”、“理想实现了”等影片受到中国广大观众的赞赏。“边塞擒谍”这部影片，观众达六百万人次。我国的“白毛女”、“中华女儿”、“赵一曼”和“翠岗红旗”等影片，同样在罗马尼亚观众中留下了难忘的印象。其中“白毛女”影片的观众达二百多万人次。此外，双方还相互举办了电影周。
    中罗两国之间的科学合作，对于发展彼此的科学研究工作和帮助彼此的社会主义经济建设起着重大的作用。在科学方面，罗马尼亚给予我国的帮助，较之我国给予罗马尼亚的帮助是更多的。罗马尼亚曾派著名的科学家来我国访问、讲学和交流经验。如航空力学家卡拉里院士、病毒学家尼古劳院士、结核病专家那斯达院士等。罗马尼亚病毒学权威尼古劳院士曾于1954年和1955年两度来我国访问讲学，对我国病毒学研究工作、教学工作、临床及防治工作都有较大的帮助。1956年来我国考察的三位罗马尼亚农学家，在我国河北省的二十八处农业科学和农田水利研究机构、农学院和农场里考察了我国的选种、栽培和施肥技术以及水稻生长丰产经验，并认为这些经验完全可能在罗马尼亚参考使用。我国农业社的多种经营、充分利用土地和劳动力以及农耕四季不息等的经验，受到他们的重视。
    相互派遣留学生是互相学习对方科学、文化成就的方法之一。双方最早派出的留学生，现在已经回到自己的祖国，献身于自己祖国的经济、文化建设工作和增进中罗友好关系的光荣事业。同时，随着留学生的增加和双方互设对方语文班，懂得双方的语文的人一天天地多起来，这对于进一步沟通两国的科学、文化联系和加强两国人民之间的深厚友谊，无疑地是一个莫大的便利。
    大家都知道罗马尼亚的乒乓球运动在国际上是最负盛名的。1957年我国乒乓球队十二人赴罗训练了一个月。在罗马尼亚专家们的耐心教导之下，我国乒乓球队在技巧上有了很大的提高。
    这次以罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡为首的罗马尼亚政府代表团来我国进行友好访问，标志着中罗友好关系的新发展。在这个时候，我们回顾一下几年来的中罗文化合作的成果，感到特别地兴奋，并且对于中罗文化合作的进一步发展充满信心。因为中罗两国的友好关系和合作是由建设社会主义的共同思想联结起来的，进一步的文化合作，自然又将有助于加强中罗兄弟般的友谊，有助于中罗两国的社会主义建设，有助于保卫世界和平的神圣事业。（附图片）
