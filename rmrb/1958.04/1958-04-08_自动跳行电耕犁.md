Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 6th - The Fujian Provincial Farm Implement Experimental Factory has recently trial-produced an automatic skip-row electric plow. This electric plow is driven by a three to five horsepower engine, and can plow about one and a half mu of paddy fields or dry land per hour, increasing efficiency by four to five times compared with the old-fashioned animal-powered plows.

At the Fujian Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Production Mechanization Observation Conference held from April 2nd to 5th, many representatives believed that this electric plow could be further improved, manufactured, and promoted.

This automatic skip-row electric plow is designed with reference to the principles of wind-powered plowing machines and field-ridge electric plowing machines that have been successfully trial-produced in Jiangsu and Fujian, etc. It weighs about twenty-three kilograms, is easy to transport, and is suitable for agricultural cooperatives with electrical equipment.

    自动跳行电耕犁
    据新华社福州6日电　福建省农具试验厂最近试制成一部自动跳行电耕犁。这种电犁由三到五马力发动机带动，每小时能翻犁水田或旱地一亩半左右，效率比用旧式畜力犁提高四、五倍。
    在4月2日到5日举行的福建省农林业生产机械化观摩大会上，许多代表都认为这种电犁可以进一步改进和制造推广。
    这种自动跳行电耕犁是参照江苏和福建等地已经试制成功的风力耕田机、田埂式电动耕田机等原理设计的，全重二十三公斤左右，搬运轻便，适宜于有电力设备的农业社应用。
