    My Master
    Li Cun, Shenyang Cardboard Box Factory
    It's been almost a month since I came to the boiler room. When I was first assigned here, the leaders told me to learn how to operate a boiler from Master Guo in the boiler room.
    When I arrived at the boiler room, Master Guo was already working there. I handed him my assignment slip. He looked at it and handed it back to me, saying, "Just tell me what's going on! I can't read."
    I said, "The leaders told me to come and be your apprentice." "Easy to say, they didn't tell me beforehand, just sent a living person here with a piece of paper."
    I could tell this old man had a stubborn temper, and I thought to myself: Can I really learn any skills from him?
    On my first official day of work, he told me to oil the water pump, handing me an oil can as he spoke. I ended up with oil all over my hands. I took a closer look, and the oil stains on the oil can were as thick as large coins, and the spout was also unsoldered. I managed to oil it once anyway. Around noon, he told me to oil the water pump again. I said, "That broken oil can can't be used anymore, let's get a new one!"
    He looked at me and said, "Just use it for now. If you want to get a new one after lunch, go ahead, and I'll keep the old one."
    I didn't say anything, but I thought to myself, "Look at how thrifty you are. We're such a big factory, and you're worried about one oil can."
    As soon as I started work in the afternoon, I went to get a new oil can and brought it back to the boiler room. I was about to put it in the toolbox when he saw it. He insisted that I go to the repair shop to borrow a pair of pliers. There was nothing wrong with the new oil can, what was there to repair?
    When I handed him the borrowed pliers, he used the tip of the pliers to pinch the spout of the oil can very small.
    I said, "If you pinch it so small, will any oil come out?"
    "This way we can save the country a lot of oil!" ×××
    When I was working in the office, I liked to practice on the horizontal bar. One day after lunch, I started practicing on the small poplar tree in front of the boiler room. A lot of people gathered around to watch. I was really getting into it when, uh oh, Master Guo came.
    "A little tree that's not even as thick as your arm, how can it support such a big person?"
    I was really embarrassed at that moment.
    When I got back to work, he told me to push coal. I pushed a small cart to the coal yard and started picking out the big chunks, thinking that big chunks of coal would be easier to burn! And cleaner.
    Just after I finished pushing one small cart, he told me, "Push some broken pieces back too, and leave the big chunks for the night shift to burn. We use more steam at night, so the lump coal burns hotter."
    I couldn't understand it at the time, thinking, "Why is this old stubborn head helping the other shift? Burning is burning, who's burning it?"
    I'd been in the boiler room for over half a month, and I hadn't even touched a shovel. One day, it just so happened that the workshop used less steam on the night shift, and I said, "Master Guo, let me shovel a couple of shovels!" He agreed and gave me pointers from the side. Seeing that I was doing okay, he said, "You're young after all, quick and nimble!"
    This was my first night shift since being sent down to the boiler room, and by twelve o'clock, I was so sleepy I could barely stand. I was dozing off in front of the furnace door.
    I don't know who shouted "Release water!" I rushed to add coal, but when I looked again, the steam gauge had dropped from 6 to 3. I got even more worried and wanted to shovel more coal. Uh oh, I forgot to take the shovel out of the furnace when I added coal just now, and the shovel handle had already burned off.
    To be honest, I was really afraid of being scolded by Master Guo when he got back.
    But now there was no one in the warehouse, where could I get a shovel?
    Just then, Master Guo came in. He took the broken shovel, told me to get the furnace hook. The old man was really good, and he got the steam back up after a few tries.
    After he finished, he walked up to me and said with a smile, "How was that? Scared, huh? This is a small matter. If the steam escapes, you'll be even more scared. If you ever encounter something like this again, you have to clear the furnace and add some lump coal." Then he glanced at the broken shovel and then at me.
    As it was getting light, Master Guo told me to oil the water pump again. I said, "Let's wait until the day shift comes to work and do it then!"
    "The water pump is the lifeline of our boiler room. If it doesn't run, the whole factory will be finished." As he spoke, he threw me a wad of rags, telling me to wipe the water pump first and then oil it.
    After I wiped the water pump's bearings, I put the oil cloth and oil can on the ash from the recently cleaned furnace, and suddenly there was a fire. He was stoking the fire and looked back to see a fire, he immediately took the leather coat hanging on the wall and threw it on the fire.
    This was an oil fire, and it didn't go out right away. It looked like it was about to burn the oil tank of the water pump, he got anxious and laid on the fire and rolled around. He finally put out the fire, but his face was injured. At this time, people from the workshop all ran over. He took my hand and said, "Little Li, it's okay, you go and wipe the water pump carefully."
    I'm not a person who ever cries, but I cried at this moment.

    我的师傅
    沈阳市纸盒厂　李村
    我来锅炉房一晃快一个月了。刚下放时候领导上告诉我到锅炉房跟郭师傅学烧锅炉。
    我到了锅炉房，郭师傅正在那里干活，我把调配单递给他，他看了看又递给我，说：“什么事你说吧！我不认识字。”
    我说：“领导上叫我来跟你当学徒。”“说的容易，事先不告诉我，就用一张纸条送来一个大活人来了。”
    我一看这老头子的脾气挺倔，心想：跟他还能学出技术来？
    正式上班的第一天，他叫我给水泵浇油，说着递给我一把油壶，弄得我满手是油。我仔细一看，油壶上的油垢足有大钱厚，壶嘴也开焊了，我好歹浇了一遍。快到晌午的时候，他又叫我给水泵浇油，我说：“那个破油壶不能用了，领个新的吧！”
    他看了看我：“将就着用一次，午后上班愿意领就领个新的，旧的留着我用。”
    我嘴里没说，心里想：“看你这个省劲，咱们这么大的工厂，还在乎你一个油壶。”
    下午一上班，我领了个新油壶回锅炉房，正准备把它放到工具箱里，被他看见了，他硬要我去修理班借把钳子来。新油壶哪里也没坏，修理什么呢？
    等我把借来的钳子递给他，他用钳子尖把油壶嘴夹得好小。
    我说：“夹得这么小，能出油吗？”
    “这样就给国家节省不少的油啊！”×××
    我在科室里工作的时候，就好练单杠，这天吃完午饭，我就在锅炉房门口的小杨树上练起来，旁边围了不少看的人。我正练得起劲，糟了，郭师傅来了。
    “还没有胳膊粗的一棵小树，架得住你这么大一个人？”
    当时真弄得我下不来台。
    上了班，他就叫我去推煤，我推着小车到了煤场一看，就挑起大块来，心想大块煤烧起来多省劲呀！又干净。
    刚推完一小车，他告诉我：“再推些碎的回来，把大块留给晚班烧。晚上用汽多，块煤火旺些。”
    我当时还想不通，心想：“这个老倔头怎么胳膊肘向外拐，谁烧不是烧呢？”
    我到锅炉房已经半个多月了，连锹把还没摸过。这天正赶上夜班车间用汽少，我说：“郭师傅，让我烧两锹吧！”他答应了，并在一旁指点着。看看我还可以就说：“到底是年轻呀，心灵手快！”
    这是我下放后第一次做夜班，一到十二点，就困得不行，站在炉门前直打盹。
    也不知道谁喊了声放水，我急忙去添煤，可是再一看，汽表已由6降到3，我更急了，想再去铲煤。糟了，我刚才添煤把铁锹放在炉里忘了拿出来，锹把已经烧断了。
    说句老实话，我心里真害怕郭师傅回来这一顿吵。
    可是，现在仓库没人，上那里去弄把铁锹来呢？
    就在这时候，郭师傅进来了，他把半截铁锹接过去，叫我去拿炉钩。老头可真行，三弄两弄汽又上来了。
    弄完了，他走到我跟前笑着说：“怎么样？慌了吧？这是小事。要是跑汽，你更慌了。以后再遇着这样事，要透炉添块煤。”说完他瞅瞅半截铁锹又看看我。
    天快亮的时候，郭师傅又叫我给水泵浇油，我说：“等他们白班上班再浇吧！”
      “水泵是咱们锅炉房的命根子，它要是不转悠，全厂就完了。”他一边说，一边扔给我一团破布，不用说，这是叫我先擦擦水泵，然后再浇油。
    我擦完了水泵的轴瓦，把油布和油壶往刚清炉出来的炉灰上一放，忽的一声起火了。他正在烧火，回头一看是火，立刻把墙上挂着的皮大衣摘下来往火上扑。
    这是油火，一下没扑灭，眼看就要烧到水泵的油槽上了，他急了，就躺在火上打滚。到底把火滚灭了，可是他脸上受了伤。这时候，车间里的人都跑来了。他拉着我的手说：“小李，不要紧，你好好的擦擦水泵吧。”
    我是从来不哭的人，这时我却哭了。
