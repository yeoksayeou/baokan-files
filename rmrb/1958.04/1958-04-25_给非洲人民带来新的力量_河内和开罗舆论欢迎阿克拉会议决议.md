Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 24th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today stating that the resolutions of the Accra Conference of Independent African States will certainly bring new strength to the African people, further developing the African people's struggle.

The editorial pointed out that the issues discussed and agreed upon at the conference are not only issues that determine the fate of African countries, but are also closely related to the movement of African and world people to defend peace and oppose colonialism. The editorial said that the conference's resolution on the Algerian issue expressed the common aspirations of the Asian and African people on the Algerian issue.

The editorial also contrasted the support of socialist countries for the Accra Conference with the schemes of imperialist propaganda organs to sow discord among African countries during the conference.

The editorial concluded by saying that after the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference, the success of the Accra Conference made the Asian and African people even more convinced that the struggle against colonialism, against imperialist provocations, and for the defense of world peace will surely achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 24th: The Cairo "Al Ahram" published an editorial on the 23rd, welcoming the resolutions adopted by the Accra Conference of Independent African States. The newspaper pointed out that these resolutions "have great and positive significance"; they will "consolidate the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference."

The newspaper pointed out that the Accra Conference's resolution condemning imperialism as a threat to the internal security of African countries and world peace is a very important development.

The newspaper pointed out that the conference's resolution on Algeria will be a powerful force in promoting Algeria's final victory.

"Al-Gomhouria" said in an editorial that the declaration of the Accra Conference is "the voice of Africa," which demonstrates the determination of independent African countries to unite and cooperate with each other to safeguard their sovereignty, help other African countries fight for independence, and maintain world peace. The newspaper said that the declaration also marks the unity of the entire Africa against colonialism, demanding that French colonialists stop the war against Algeria, and demanding that France's allies not support French aggression in Algeria.

"Al-Akhbar" said that the resolutions of the Accra Conference show the determination of the conference to continue implementing the policy of protecting the continent, opposing colonialism and racial discrimination. Colonialism and racial discrimination are the two major evils affecting the people of African countries and threatening world peace.

The newspaper pointed out that the massacres being carried out in Algeria, Kenya, and Cameroon, and the racial discrimination practiced against the people of several African countries, are serious violations of the United Nations Charter by members of the United Nations. It also said that the Accra Conference should be seen as a means of drawing the United Nations' attention to its basic responsibilities.

    给非洲人民带来新的力量
    河内和开罗舆论欢迎阿克拉会议决议
    新华社河内24日电　越南“人民报”今天发表社论说，在阿克拉举行的非洲独立国家会议的决议，一定会给非洲人民带来新的力量，使得非洲人民的斗争进一步发展。
    社论指出，会议所讨论和达成协议的各项问题，不仅是决定非洲各国命运的问题，而且也是同非洲和世界人民保卫和平、反对殖民主义的运动密切相关的问题。社论说，会议对阿尔及利亚问题的决议，表达了亚非人民对阿尔及利亚问题的共同愿望。
    社论还就社会主义国家对阿克拉会议的支持和帝国主义宣传机关在会议期间进行的离间非洲国家团结的阴谋作了对比。
    社论最后说，在万隆会议和开罗会议之后，阿克拉会议的成功，使得亚非人民更加相信，反对殖民主义、反对帝国主义挑衅和保卫世界和平的斗争一定会取得最后的胜利。
    新华社开罗24日电　开罗“晚报”在23日发表社论，欢迎非洲独立国家会议通过的决议。报纸指出，这些决议“具有重大和积极的意义”；它们将“巩固万隆会议和开罗会议的决议”。
    这家报纸指出，阿克拉会议的决议谴责帝国主义是对非洲国家内部安全和世界和平的威胁，这是一个很重要的发展。
    这家报纸指出，会议关于阿尔及利亚的决议将是使阿尔及利亚获得最后胜利的有力的促进力量。
    “金字塔报”的社论说，阿克拉会议的宣言是“非洲的呼声”，它表明了非洲独立国家要团结一致、互相合作，来维护它们的主权、帮助其它非洲国家争取独立的斗争和维护世界和平的决心。这家报纸说，宣言也标志着整个非洲一致起来反对殖民主义，要求法国殖民主义者停止对阿尔及利亚的战争，并且要求法国的盟国不要支持法国在阿尔及利亚的侵略。
    “消息报”说，阿克拉会议的决议表明，会议决心继续执行保护这个大陆、反对殖民主义和种族歧视的政策。殖民主义和种族歧视是影响非洲各国人民和威胁世界和平的两大罪恶。
    这家报纸指出，正在阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚、喀麦隆进行的大屠杀和对若干非洲国家人民实行的种族歧视，都是联合国会员国严重破坏联合国宪章的行为。它又说，阿克拉会议应该被看作是提请联合国注意它的基本职责的一个手段。
