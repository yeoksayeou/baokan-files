    Taiwan Dollar Devaluation, Prices Soar
    Chiang Kai-shek Imposes "Head Tax" Again in Taiwan
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to Taiwan newspaper reports on the 16th, commodity prices in Taiwan have surged in recent days, and the market is in chaos. The market price of daily-use industrial products such as soap has skyrocketed by 40%. Grains, medicines, groceries, seafood, milk, canned goods, and other commodities have also risen in price. Imported hardware, electrical materials, chemicals, and industrial raw materials are being hoarded by Kuomintang bureaucratic commercial institutions and merchants, and many private factories cannot buy raw materials, resulting in work stoppages and production cuts.
    This fierce economic storm in Taiwan was triggered by the Chiang Kai-shek clique's announcement and implementation of the so-called "Improved Foreign Exchange Trade Program" on the 12th. The main content of this new plan is to devalue the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar against the US dollar. The official exchange rate has been changed from the original NT$26.35 per US dollar to the current NT$36.38 per US dollar, a devaluation of approximately 40%. After this "new plan" was announced, Haraldson, director of the Taiwan branch of the United States International Cooperation Administration, immediately told Taiwanese reporters with great excitement that he was "happy to see this new plan implemented."

### 台币贬值　物价飞涨  蒋介石又在台湾大抽“人头税”

    台币贬值　物价飞涨
    蒋介石又在台湾大抽“人头税”
    据新华社讯　综合台湾报纸16日消息：近几天来台湾物价猛涨，市场混乱。肥皂等日用工业品的市价暴涨了四成。粮食、药品、杂货、海产、奶类、罐头和其他商品，也都纷纷涨价。进口的五金、电料、化学、工业原料等被国民党官僚商业机构和商人囤积起来，许多民营工厂买不到原料，停工减产。
    台湾这一场猛烈的经济风暴，是蒋介石集团在12日公布实施所谓“改进外汇贸易方案”掀起的。这个新方案的主要内容是贬低台币对美元的比值。官价结汇由原来的台币二十六元三角五分换一美元，改为现在的台币三十六元三角八分换一美元，即台币贬值约40％。当这个“新方案”公布后，美国国际合作署台湾分署署长哈拉德逊立刻兴高采烈地对台湾记者说：他“乐于看到这项新方案付诸实施。”
