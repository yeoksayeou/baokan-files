Wild Plant Resources

	Cocklebur Seed
	Cocklebur seed is an annual herbaceous wild plant, widely distributed throughout the country. Cocklebur seeds contain 17%-21% oil, with a general oil yield of 10%, and a maximum oil yield of 15% (in Lin County, Shanxi). Cocklebur seed oil is a drying oil, which can be mixed with tung oil to make paint, and is also a major raw material for manufacturing inks and soaps. This oil can also be used for lighting and eating. Cocklebur seed cake can also be used as feed and fertilizer. According to tests by the North China Agricultural Science Institute, the nutritional value of cocklebur seed cake is similar to that of soybean cake. In 1956, various regions purchased approximately 5,000 tons of cocklebur seeds, which could produce more than 500 tons of oil and 3,000 tons of cake.

	Acorn
	Acorn is the seed of the oak tree. Oak trees, also known as hemp oak, zashu oak, and qinggang oak, are deciduous trees that grow in mountainous forests. This tree is widely distributed in China, and the yield of acorns is very large. According to estimates by relevant departments, the national annual output of acorns is approximately 4.6 million tons.

	Acorn kernels generally contain more than 50% starch, which is suitable for winemaking and starch production. According to experiments by individual wineries in Henan, every 100 jin of acorn kernels can produce 37 to 40 jin of 56-proof baijiu (white liquor). The quality of the baijiu is the same as that brewed from grain. The distiller's grains left over from making wine with acorn kernels can also be used as feed.

	Acorn kernels can also be used as human food. In Sichuan, it is used to make tofu, and in Shanxi, it is mixed with flour to make pastries. The oak shell outside the acorn (i.e., the acorn cup) can be used to extract tannins—tanning agents indispensable to the leather industry—called oak glue.

	Glasswort Seed
	Glasswort seed (also known as alkali salicornia) grows in coastal areas of China and has a high and concentrated yield. According to statistics, the annual output of Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shandong provinces is more than 5,000 tons. The oil content of glasswort seed is about 26%, and the oil yield is more than 16%. The oil properties and uses are roughly the same as those of cocklebur seed. In 1956, Liaoning, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces purchased a total of 44 tons of glasswort seed oil. Some of these oils were supplied to Shanghai oil and grease and soap factories, and some were supplied to farmers for painting farm implements.

    野生植物资源
    苍耳籽
    苍耳籽是一年生草木野生植物，它的分布很广，几乎遍及全国。苍耳籽含油量17％—21％，一般的出油率是10％，最高的出油率是15％（在山西临县）。苍耳籽油为干性油，可以掺和桐油制油漆，也是制造油墨、肥皂的主要原料。这种油也能点灯、食用。苍耳籽油饼也可以作饲料、肥料。据华北农业科学研究所化验，苍耳籽油饼的营养价值和豆饼差不多。1956年各地收购了苍耳籽大约五千吨，可产油五百多吨、饼三千吨。
    橡子
    橡子是橡树的种子。橡树又叫麻栎、柞树、青冈树等，是一种生于山区林野的落叶乔木。这种树在我国分布极广，橡子的产量很大。据有关部门估算，全国每年橡子的产量约有四百六十万吨。
    橡子仁一般含淀粉50％以上，适于酿酒、制淀粉。据河南个别酒厂试验，每百斤橡子仁可产五十六度白酒三十七斤到四十斤。白酒的质量和用粮食酿造的相同。用橡仁制酒剩下的酒糟，还可以作饲料。
    橡仁也可以作人的食品。四川有用它作豆腐的，山西有用它掺面作点心的。橡子外面的橡壳（即橡碗子）可以提炼制革工业不可缺少的鞣剂——烤胶。
    盐蒿籽
    盐蒿籽（又名碱蓬）生长在我国沿海地区，产量高而集中。据统计，江苏、河北、山东三省年产量在五千吨以上。盐蒿籽的含油量在26％左右，出油率在16％以上。油性、用途大致和苍耳籽相同。1956年辽宁、山东、江苏三省共收购盐蒿籽油四十四吨。这些油一部分供应上海油脂、肥皂厂，一部分供应农民油漆农具。
