    A New Upsurge in Afforestation
    Afforestation is closely related to the development of our country's socialist economic construction. Now, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have issued instructions on large-scale afforestation throughout the country, calling on the people of the whole country to make greater efforts to rapidly develop afforestation, and strive to achieve the goal of greening all afforestable wasteland and barren hills, and greening the sides of houses, villages, roads, and rivers within ten years, as proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program. We believe that the people of the whole country will respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council with new achievements in afforestation.
    Since the beginning of this year, a large-scale afforestation campaign has been launched in various parts of the country. As of the end of March, more than 170 million mu of afforestation has been completed nationwide, equivalent to 110% of the amount completed during the First Five-Year Plan period. Many areas across the country have eliminated large areas of wasteland and barren hills, and the "four sides" planting in rural areas and the tree planting work in cities have also made great progress. This fact proves that it is entirely possible to achieve the ten-year afforestation requirement stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. However, as pointed out in the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, there are still some places where the masses lack sufficient understanding and confidence in afforestation, lack enthusiasm, and lack methods; in particular, they often only pay attention to afforestation and not to forest cultivation and regeneration of harvested areas, so that they plant a lot but few survive and grow slowly; or they cut a lot but plant little and plant slowly. Some leading bodies have not yet made great efforts to reverse this situation, or lack comprehensive planning and correct guidelines for afforestation, so they cannot fully and effectively mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council require all localities to quickly overcome these shortcomings so that afforestation can develop universally and systematically, and change the current situation of insufficient forests and extremely unbalanced distribution in our country in as short a period as possible.
    What is required here first is a positive, far-sighted, and comprehensive greening plan. With such a plan, we can effectively lead the broad masses to develop afforestation. The greening plan should be regarded as an important component of the overall plan for transforming the natural landscape and developing production. When formulating the various indicators for greening, it is necessary to fully consider the diverse needs of maintaining soil and water, overcoming floods and droughts, large-scale development of basic construction and various forest product industries, and improving the lives of farmers. Not only should we cultivate a large number of timber forests to increase the national timber reserves, but also, according to natural conditions, set appropriate ratios to cultivate a large number of economic forests such as fruit and oil forests, and a large number of protective forests such as soil and water conservation forests, sand prevention forests, windbreak forests, and coastal defense forests, and also cultivate firewood and charcoal forests needed for the daily use of the broad masses. In order to achieve the goal of multiple afforestation, it is necessary to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses for afforestation, especially to encourage the masses to develop various economic forests in large quantities, and to prevent the one-sided tendency of developing timber forests while neglecting economic forests.
    At present, some greening plans only have the number of mu of afforestation and the number of trees planted, and no other indicators, which is not comprehensive. A comprehensive greening plan should not only have the number of mu and the number of trees, but also have growth indicators for afforestation density and coverage rate (the ratio of forest area to the total land area). Not only should there be indicators for the survival rate of saplings, but also the time limit for tree closure (that is, the saplings have grown up and the branches and leaves are luxuriant and form shade). Not only should production targets for various forest products be set, but also the proportion of planting various trees (and in some places, grass) should be set. With these indicators, it is easy to implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical in the afforestation movement, and it is also easy to check and evaluate. We suggest that all localities review and revise their greening plans in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.
    In a large-scale, intensive afforestation campaign, special attention should be paid to the quality of afforestation. Planting trees should not only be done in large quantities and quickly, but also be done well, to ensure more survival and faster growth. Only in this way can we achieve the greening plan more quickly. In the past, some places mobilized a large amount of manpower and material resources to plant trees, but due to insufficient ideological education, lack of technical guidance, and failure to nurture and protect young forests after planting, some of the planted trees died. This is not only a serious waste, but also dampened the confidence and enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation. Many areas have paid attention to this issue from the beginning this year, but some areas still do not pay enough attention to it. The Second Agricultural Cooperative of Baimao Township, Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, recently organized an inspection team to inspect the afforestation work and found that "nine out of ten trees planted were falling down." Even if this phenomenon only accounts for a small number, it is still worth paying attention to.
    Seed preparation, especially seedling raising, is of decisive significance for the afforestation campaign in the coming autumn and spring, especially for improving the quality of afforestation. Since the Ministry of Forestry held the poplar seedling raising conference in Shenyang, all localities have taken active measures for seed collection and seedling raising this spring. However, judging from the progress of the current seedling raising work, as of the end of March, only 50% of this year's seedling raising task has been completed, and the progress is still slow. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously promote it to ensure the completion of the seedling raising task, otherwise it will have an adverse impact on future afforestation work.
    Recently, the first batch of counties and townships claiming to be greened have emerged in various places. However, strictly speaking, these counties and townships have only taken the first step on the road to greening - sowing or planting seedlings. Sowing seeds in the fields does not equal a harvest; similarly, scattering tree seeds or planting seedlings does not equal greening. Whether most of the planted trees have survived? Whether the surviving trees can all quickly become forests? These are still problems that have not been completely solved. Therefore, even in advanced areas, it is now necessary to conduct a general inspection of afforestation work and immediately replant and restock where there are missing seedlings.
    In the past, some areas regarded afforestation as a temporary task, and there was a lot of activity during tree planting every year, but afterwards, few people took care of some necessary routine management activities. This is one of the reasons for the backwardness of forestry work in these areas. We should follow the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and combine seasonal, large-scale, intensive afforestation with year-round forestry management. Not only should we plant trees, but also regularly carry out work such as tending young forests, artificially regenerating harvested areas, protecting forests from fire, and collecting seeds and raising seedlings, to ensure the comprehensive development of afforestation.
    Fully mobilizing the broad masses to participate in the afforestation movement is what the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council emphasize; the instructions also emphasize the principle of focusing on cooperative afforestation while actively developing state-owned afforestation. Rural Party organizations should actively conduct ideological education among farmers while organizing a high tide of agricultural production and construction, so that every household, men, women, old and young, understand the great significance of afforestation for the national economy and the people's livelihood, understand the close relationship between forestry and agriculture, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations, and encourage the masses to actively plant trees and make forests. At the same time, it is also necessary to conscientiously summarize and promote advanced experiences and popularize technical knowledge of afforestation among the broad masses. In addition, in order to ensure the normal operation of forestry, agricultural and forestry cooperatives in various places also need to properly solve the problems of labor arrangement between agriculture and forestry, labor organization for forestry management, and labor remuneration.
    Let the people of the whole country take active action, seize the season, plant more trees, plant more grass, push the afforestation movement to a new upsurge, and strive to double the forest area in ten years or less!

### 植树造林要有一个新高潮

    植树造林要有一个新高潮
    植树造林对于我们国家社会主义经济建设的发展，有十分密切的关系。现在，中共中央和国务院发出了关于在全国大规模造林的指示，号召全国人民用更大的努力迅速发展造林事业，力争提前实现全国农业发展纲要所提出的十年绿化一切可以绿化的荒地、荒山和绿化宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁的目标。我们相信，全国人民一定会用造林上的新成就来回答党中央和国务院的号召。
    今年年初以来，全国各地陆续开展了大规模的造林运动。截至3月底，全国已造林一亿七千多万亩，相当于第一个五年计划期间完成数的110％。全国已有许多地区消灭了大片的荒地荒山，农村的“四旁”植树和城市的植树工作，也有很大进展。这个事实证明，农业发展纲要所规定的十年造林要求，完全有可能提前实现。但是，正如中共中央和国务院的指示中所指出的，还有一些地方，群众对造林的认识和信心不足，劲头不大，办法不多；特别是往往只重视造林，而不重视育林和迹地更新，以至种得多，活得少，长得慢；或者是伐得多，种得少，种得慢。有一些领导机关对于这种情况还没有大力扭转，或者缺乏造林的全面规划和正确方针，因而还不能充分有效地发挥群众的积极性。中共中央和国务院要求各地迅速克服这些缺点，使造林事业能够普遍地、有计划地向前发展，在尽可能短的时期内改变我国森林不足和分布极不平衡的现状。
    这里首先要求有一个积极的、有远见的和全面的绿化规划。有了这样的规划，才能有效地领导广大群众发展造林事业。应当把绿化规划看成是改造自然面貌、发展生产的总的规划中一个重要组成部分。在制订绿化的各项指标的时候，必须充分考虑到保持水土、克服水旱灾害、大规模发展基本建设和各种林产品工业、改善农民生活等各方面多种多样的需要。不但要大量培育用材林，增加全国木材的积蓄量，而且要按照自然条件，定出适当比例，大量培育果木林、油料林等各种经济林，大量培育水土保持林、防沙林、防风林、海防林等各种防护林，同时也要适当培育广大人民日用所需的薪炭林。为了实现多种造林的目的，必须发动广大群众造林的积极性，特别要鼓励群众大量发展各种经济林，要防止片面地发展用材林而忽视经济林的偏向。
    目前有些地方的绿化规划中只有造林亩数和植树株数，没有其他指标，这是不全面的。一个全面的绿化规划，不仅要有亩数、株数，而且要有造林密度和覆盖率（森林面积同全部土地面积的比率）的增长指标。不但要有幼树成活率的指标，而且要有树木郁闭（就是幼树已经长大，枝叶繁茂成荫）的期限。不但要订出各种林产品的产量指标，而且要订出种植各种树木（有的地方还加上种草）的比例。有了这些指标，就便于在造林运动中贯彻多快好省的方针，也便于检查和评比。我们建议各地根据中共中央和国务院指示的精神，对自己的绿化规划加以审查和修订。
    在大规模的突击造林运动中，造林质量应当特别注意。栽树不但要栽得多，栽得快，还要栽得好，保证活得多，长得快。这样才能更快地实现绿化规划。过去有些地方动员大量人力物力去植树，但是由于思想教育不够，技术指导不力，再加植树之后不去抚育和保护幼林，结果，栽下的树有一部分死掉了。这不但是严重的浪费，而且挫伤了群众对于造林事业的信心和积极性。这个问题，今年许多地区一开始就注意了，但是也有部分地区仍然重视不够。江苏省常熟县白茆乡第二农业合作社最近组织检查队对造林工作进行检查，发现植树“十棵竟有九棵倒”。这种现象即使只占少数，也十分值得注意。
    种苗准备工作，尤其是育苗工作，对今秋明春的造林运动，特别是对于提高造林质量有决定的意义。林业部在沈阳召开杨树育苗会议以后，各地对于今春采种和育苗的工作都采取了积极措施，但就目前育苗工作的进度来看，到3月底止，仅完成今年育苗任务的50％，进度还是缓慢的。因此，必须大力推动，以保证育苗任务的完成，否则将给今后的造林工作以不利的影响。
    最近各地已经出现了第一批号称绿化的县和乡。可是严格地说，这些县和乡只不过是在绿化的道路上走了第一步——播种或植苗。种田播下了庄稼种子，并不等于收成；同样，撒下树种或栽下树苗，也并不等于绿化。种植的树木是不是绝大部分都活了？活了的树是不是能全部迅速成林？这仍然是没有完全解决的问题。所以，即使是先进地区，现在也有必要对造林工作进行一次普遍的检查，发现缺苗就立即补种补栽。
    过去有些地区把造林工作当作一种临时性的任务，每年植树的时候热闹一阵，事后一些必要的经常性的经营活动就很少有人管了。这是这些地区林业工作落后的原因之一。我们应当遵照中共中央和国务院的指示，把季节性的大规模的突击造林同常年的林业经营结合起来。既要造林，又要经常作好幼林抚育、采伐迹地的人工更新、护林防火、采种育苗等工作，保证造林事业全面发展。
    充分发动广大群众参加造林运动，这是中共中央和国务院指示中所强调的；指示还强调要以合作社造林为主，同时积极发展国营造林的方针。农村党组织应当在组织农业生产建设高潮的同时，积极对农民进行思想教育，使家家户户男女老幼都明白植树造林对于国计民生的重大意义，明白林业同农业、水利、畜牧、副业之间的密切关系，鼓舞群众积极植树造林。同时还要认真总结和推广先进经验，在广大群众中普及造林的技术知识。此外，为了保证林业的正常经营，各地农林业合作社还需要妥善解决农林业间的劳力安排、经营林业的劳动组织和劳动报酬等问题。
    全国人民积极行动起来，抓紧季节，多种树，多种草，把植树造林运动推向新高潮，为在十年或更短时间内使森林面积增加一倍而奋斗！
