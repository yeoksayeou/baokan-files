Entering Shaoshan Township, you immediately see striking slogans painted on the walls of farmers' houses: "Apply 50 tons of fertilizer per mu, produce 500 kilograms of grain per mu," "Compare the number of workdays during the day, compare the number of students at night, transform Shaoshan Township into a four-without township." Yu Dianwu, the Township Party Secretary, Liu Xiuhua, the Director of the Shaoshan Cooperative, and many cooperative members believe that achieving an average yield of 567 jin per mu last year and 1100 jin per mu this year is within reach. Where does their confidence lie? Comrade Liu Xiuhua said that the farmers' awareness has been raised through the struggle against capitalist ideology in the township. Mao Gang, a demobilized soldier, said that we are in Chairman Mao's hometown, everyone has a high level of awareness, can accept advanced experiences, and will do whatever the Party tells us to do.

Indeed, they are not exaggerating. Taking fertilization as an example, in previous years, more than 10 tons of fertilizer were applied per mu, while this year, an average of 120 tons will be applied per mu. A production team of twenty to thirty households will accumulate nearly 2000 tons of fertilizer. One source of fertilizer for this cooperative is the "dual-purpose stove's" "fire-soil ash." On average, each household can accumulate several tons of fertilizer per year from this alone. This "fire-soil ash" is even more effective than pond mud. Currently, the fertilizer has been delivered to the fields, with at least 50 tons per mu!

Last winter and this spring, the Shaoshan Cooperative also built a reservoir that can store 60,000 cubic meters of water. The masses call this reservoir the "Frugality Reservoir," to distinguish it from a reservoir built by the government last winter and spring. The old reservoir and the newly built "Frugality Reservoir" can both store 60,000 cubic meters of water, but the old reservoir cost 60,000 workdays and nearly 70,000 yuan, while the new reservoir only cost 12,000 workdays and 700 yuan! The two reservoirs can irrigate 2,000 mu of paddy fields. They have also built 120 ponds and six river dams. One of the ponds was built by the Youth Shock Brigade, who worked in shifts under gas lamps at night, taking one month and 1,800 workdays to complete, and can irrigate more than 100 mu of fields. Their water conservancy construction can prevent drought for sixty days.

The Shaoshan Cooperative has also paid attention to the reform of cultivation techniques this year. This is mainly paddy field area. In the past, close planting was not practiced. This year, close planting is being promoted. Single-season rice is being planted at a spacing of 4x6 inches or 6x6 inches, and double-season rice is being planted at 3x6 inches. In this way, each mu can reach about 20,000 to 30,000 seedlings, and the yield will naturally increase by one to two times compared to last year.

The Shaoshan Cooperative has also created 100 mu of high-yield fields, with the lowest target being 1,000 kilograms, and some aiming for 1,500 kilograms and 2,000 kilograms.

They also started transplanting rice seedlings earlier this year. In 1957, rice seeds were sown before the Qingming Festival, but this year they were sown during the Spring Equinox; in 1957, rice seedlings were transplanted at the Beginning of Summer, but this year they will be transplanted before Grain Rain.

Regarding seed improvement, last year most used "Red Foot" and "Blue Foot" varieties, but this year they generally use "Nante" more often, which is estimated to increase the yield by more than 25 kilograms per mu.

Regarding eliminating illiteracy, they proposed "marching towards culture." Words are written in chalk on household utensils in farmers' houses, such as "dual-purpose stove" and "chopstick basket"; they also adopted the method of having elementary school students act as little teachers.

They plan to vigorously eliminate the four pests, not leaving puddles of water in front of houses, frequently cleaning toilets, and eliminating flies and mosquitoes.

In order to increase farmers' income and increase fertilizer, the entire township has ordered 1,000 sows. Last year, each household averaged 1.8 pigs, but this year each person should reach 0.5 pigs. The entire township will increase fish farming to 25 kilograms per person. The entire township is also preparing to build a rice mill, a small coal mine, a farm tool factory, and a meat processing factory.

The person in charge of the Township Party Committee said that last year the average income per person in the entire township was 87.5 yuan, and this year it will reach 130 yuan. If we actively develop mountain forests, increase the planting of fruit trees, tung oil trees, tea oil trees, tea trees, and high-value crops such as ginger and atractylodes, the average income per person can reach 400 yuan within the second five-year plan.

On March 26, a cold wave struck, with a sudden drop in temperature of ten degrees, and an eighth-level gale whistled through Shaoshan Township with rain. The Township Party Committee secretaries set off separately to lead the protection of rice seedlings and water release, and the thirty-five teams of the Shaoshan Cooperative went to the fields as usual. All but those who were cleaning up at home from the thirty-one laborers of the "Changchong" team turned out. He Fuxiang, sixty-seven years old, went to cut bamboo regardless of the wind and rain, his son He Yuanshou actively participated in protecting the rice seedlings, and He Fuxiang's old partner, who was over sixty years old, went out to deliver babies in spite of the strong wind. This is how the people of the Shaoshan Cooperative live and struggle.

In Chairman Mao's hometown, the mountains and rivers are green, the pine forests and bamboo groves are green, azaleas bloom all over the mountains and valleys in spring, and everything is full of vitality. ·Yu Yifu·

### 毛主席故乡——韶山乡

    毛主席故乡——韶山乡
    一入韶山乡就见路旁农户墙壁上写着醒目的标语：“亩放千担肥，亩产千斤粮”、“日比出工人数，夜比入学学员，变韶山乡为四无乡”。乡党委书记于殿武同志和韶山社主任刘秀华同志以及许多社员们都认为去年平均亩产五百六十七斤，今年亩产一千一百斤是有把握的。把握在那里呢？刘秀华同志说，乡里经过反资本主义思想斗争，农民觉悟提高了。转业军人毛刚说，我们这里是毛主席的故乡，每个人觉悟高，能够接受先进经验，党说怎样搞就怎样搞。
    的确，他们一点也不夸大，就施肥一项来说，往年每亩施肥一百多担，今年每亩施肥平均要达到一千二百担，一个生产小队二三十户人家即要积肥近二十万担。这个社的肥源之一是“两用灶”里的“火土灰”。平均每户仅此一项，一年即可积肥几百担。这种“火土灰”比塘泥还有劲。目前肥已送到田里，每亩最少有五百担了！
    去冬今春韶山社又修了一个可蓄水六万方的水库。这水库群众称之为“勤俭水库”，以别于前冬去春公家花钱修的一个水库。旧水库和新修的“勤俭水库”同样可蓄水六万方，但旧水库花了六万个工，近七万元钱；而新水库则只花一万二千个工，七百元钱！两个水库可灌溉水田两千亩。他们还兴修了一百二十个塘，六座河坝。其中有一个塘是青年突击大队，晚间点上煤气灯，换班干，用一个月时间一千八百个工修成的，可灌溉百多亩田。他们的水利建设可防旱六十天。
    韶山社今年还注意了耕作技术的改革。这里主要是稻田，往年并未密植，今年推行密植，单季稻推行4×6寸或6×6寸的距离，双季稻3×6寸。这样每亩可达两万蔸乃至三万蔸左右，产量自然比去年增加一倍到两倍了。
    韶山社还搞了丰产田一百亩，最低的指标都是两千斤，也有三千斤和四千斤的。
    他们今年还提早插秧。1957年清明以前谷种下泥，今年则在春分下种；1957年立夏才插秧，今年则谷雨前插秧。
    改良种籽方面，去年多数使用“红脚”“蓝脚”，今年一般用“南特”的多，估计一亩可增产五十多斤。
    对扫除文盲，他们提出“向文化进军”。农民屋里用具上都用粉笔写上了字，如“两用灶”“筷篮”等；他们也采用了小学生当小先生的办法。
    他们规划大力消灭四害，屋门口不留水凼（读“荡”），厕所勤清除，清除苍蝇蚊虫。
    为了增加农民收入和增加肥料，全乡已定购一千头母猪。去年每户平均一点八头猪，今年每人要达到一头半。全乡每人养鱼要增加到五十斤。全乡还预备搞一个碾米厂，一个小煤窑，一个农具厂，一个肉食加工厂。
    乡党委会负责人说，去年全乡每人平均收入八十七元五角，今年要达到一百三十元。如果积极开发山林，增植果树、桐油、茶油、茶叶树和高额产值作物，如生姜、平术等，第二个五年计划内可以达到每人平均收入四百元。
    3月26日寒潮侵袭，突然降温十度，八级的大风还夹着雨呼啸在韶山乡上空。乡党委会书记们分头出发领导护秧放水，韶山社三十五个小队也照常下田。“长冲”小队三十一个劳动力除在家搞卫生的以外都出动了。六十七岁的贺福祥不顾风吹雨淋去砍竹子，他的儿子贺远寿积极参加护秧，贺福祥的老伴六十多岁了，还冒着大风出去给人接生。韶山社的人民就是这样生活着斗争着。
    在毛主席的故乡山水是青的，松林和竹丛是青的，杜鹃花儿春天开遍了满山满谷，一切都充满着生命力。·于毅夫·
