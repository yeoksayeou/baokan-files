    Against British Colonial Policy
    Aden Workers Hold General Strike
    Three Sheikhdoms Refuse to Extend Oil Exploration Agreement
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Aden: Aden workers held a nationwide general strike on April 25th to protest the immigration law formulated by British imperialists. This law allows citizens of the British Commonwealth to immigrate to Aden, while harming the freedom and legitimate rights of the people of Aden.
    On April 25th, the vast majority of shops ceased business, sugar refineries stopped work, and the port was paralyzed. Many striking workers took to the streets to demonstrate.
    After the general strike by Aden workers, British imperialists immediately attempted to suppress it. According to a report in "Al-Ahram" on the 26th, the British authorities dismissed 750 Arab workers from the oil refinery in Buraiqa, a suburb of Aden.
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Cairo, April 26th: According to a report in "Al-Ahram" on the 26th, the three sheikhdoms of Lahej, Hadhramaut, and Huzaibi in the "Aden Protectorate" (southern Yemen) refused to extend the oil exploration agreements signed with Britain, which are due to expire this year. The report said that when the British Governor of Aden proposed extending the agreements, the three sheikhs said that they were unwilling to extend the agreements until the British troops withdrew from the three sheikhdoms, until Britain released the nationalist leaders such as Abdullah Jiffry, the educational administrator of the Lahej sheikhdom, and until Britain stopped attacking Lahej.

    反对英国殖民政策
    亚丁工人举行总罢工
    三酋长国拒绝延长石油勘探协定
    据新华社讯　亚丁消息：亚丁工人在4月25日举行全国性的总罢工，抗议英帝国主义者制订的移民法，这项法律允许英联邦的公民移入亚丁，同时却损害亚丁人民的自由和合法权利。
    在4月25日这一天，绝大部分的商店都停止营业，制糖厂停了工，港口也陷于瘫痪，许多罢工的工人都到街上去举行示威。
    在亚丁工人举行了总罢工以后，英帝国主义者即设法进行镇压。据“金字塔报”26日报道，英国当局解雇了亚丁郊区布赖卡的炼油厂中七百五十名阿拉伯工人。
    新华社开罗26日电　据“金字塔报”26日报道，“亚丁保护地”（也门南部）的三个酋长国拉赫杰、哈德拉穆特和胡希比拒绝延长同英国签订的在今年满期的石油勘探协定。消息说，当亚丁的英国总督提出这个延长协定的建议时，三位酋长说，在英国军队撤出三个酋长国以前，在英国释放拉赫杰酋长国的教育行政官阿卜杜拉·吉弗里等民族主义者以前，以及在英国停止向拉赫杰进攻以前，他们是不愿意延长这项协定的。
