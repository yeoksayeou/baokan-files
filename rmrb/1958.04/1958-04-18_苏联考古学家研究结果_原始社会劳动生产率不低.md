Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: According to TASS, Soviet archaeologists have concluded after years of research that the widespread view in world scientific literature that labor productivity in primitive society was extremely low is incorrect.

The archaeologists studied labor tools from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and early Bronze Ages. The expedition conducted investigations in the Kaunas region, which produces slate and basalt, and on the banks of the Angara River in Siberia, which produces jade.

The preliminary results of the experiments were astonishing: In just one month, two people with very rudimentary manual labor skills made more than thirty tools—stone axes, hand axes, chisels, stone knives, bone knives, and bronze axes. Polishing an axe from slate took about four hours, not a month as previously estimated in the literature. Felling a pine tree with a diameter of 25 centimeters took only fifteen minutes with a stone axe.

The investigators on the banks of the Angara River polished many hand axes and knives from jade, and manufactured copper axes, copper fish spears, and fishhooks using cold working methods. All this work took only a few tenths of the time we had calculated until now.

Two people used stone axes, copper axes, and copper knives to chisel a pine trunk with a diameter of 60 centimeters into a wooden boat in just ten days. This type of boat is very stable in the water and can move at a speed of two and a half meters per second.

The Soviet archaeological school believes that if human labor in primitive communal society had been as inefficient as scientists currently conjecture, the great achievements in material culture achieved by people in primitive communal society would have been impossible.

    苏联考古学家研究结果
    原始社会劳动生产率不低
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联考古学家经过多年研究得出结论，在世界科学文献中所流传关于原始社会中劳动生产率极低的看法是错误的。
    考古学家们对旧石器时代、新石器时代和青铜器时代初期劳动工具进行了研究。考察队在出产片岩、玄武岩的考那斯地区和西伯利亚出产玉石的安加拉河岸地区分别进行考察。
    试验的初步结果便是惊人的：仅仅在一个月之内两个手工劳动技巧极不熟练的人就制造出三十多件工具——石斧、手斧、凿子、石刀和骨头刀、铜斧。用片岩磨出一把斧子需要四个小时左右，而不是像文献中所推断的需要一个月。用石斧砍伐直径为二十五公分的松树只要十五分钟。
    安加拉河岸的考察者用玉石磨制了许多手斧和刀，用冷加工法制造铜斧、铜鱼钗、鱼钩。所有这一切工作所需要的时间只及我们直到目前所计算的时间的几十分之一。
    两个人用石斧、铜斧和铜刀把直径为六十公分的松树干凿刨成一条木船，只要十天。这种船在水中很稳定，每秒钟能划动二公尺半。
    苏联考古学派认为，假如在原始公社社会人的劳动像科学家现今所臆测得那样没有效率，那么在原始公社社会人们所取得的物质文化的巨大成就就会是不可能的。
