	Weeds That Can't Be Burned Out by Wildfire
	Lin Wei
	In fields, roadsides, watersides, or mountain wilderness, various weeds grow rampantly throughout the year. Especially in this late spring weather, they flourish everywhere, truly "wildfire burns them not, spring breeze blows them to life again."

	When weeds are mentioned, people always find them annoying. They bring us many harms: in farmland, they rob crops of the nutrients, water, air, and sunlight they need, and also help the spread of diseases and pests, affecting the yield and quality of crops; weeding further increases production costs. If livestock are carelessly fed poisonous or foul-smelling weeds, they can be poisoned or the dairy products they produce can be tainted. A yard full of weeds makes the environment particularly desolate and unclean, and also provides a habitat for mosquitoes. In the Jiangnan area, the intermediate host of schistosomiasis—the Oncomelania hupensis snail—particularly likes to live on a type of wild grass that grows by the water.

	However, weeds are not entirely useless to humans. Weeds growing on slopes, embankments, or pond edges are the best natural cover, preventing soil erosion; many wild vegetables such as shepherd's purse and kalimeris indica can be eaten; rhizoma cyperi, prunella vulgaris, and pinellia ternata can be used for medicinal purposes; many weeds can be used as feed for poultry and livestock or as farm fertilizer (green manure or compost); some can be used to landscape gardens, laying down a velvety lawn; and some can even serve as indicators of mineral deposits underground. The "Dapowan Huahua" (Viola philippica) which is now famous throughout the country, can even help us kill mosquitoes and flies.

	Weeds can be roughly divided into four categories: annual, biennial, perennial, and parasitic. Most annual weeds germinate in the spring and die in the autumn and winter, such as barnyard grass, spiny amaranth, and small goosefoot, all of which survive the cold winter as seeds; biennial species germinate in the autumn and die in the summer of the following year, such as shepherd's purse and chickweed, which survive the summer as seeds.

	Most perennial weeds have their above-ground stems and leaves die in winter, but their underground parts can safely overwinter, and new buds sprout again in the following spring, such as kalimeris indica, rhizoma cyperi, and imperata cylindrica. In addition to being able to reproduce by seeds, they also have the ability to reproduce by means of vegetative organs such as roots and stems.

	Parasitic weeds cannot live independently and rely entirely on parasitizing other plants, such as dodder, which parasitizes soybeans. They also reproduce by seeds.

	The reason why weeds grow everywhere and are not easily eradicated is because they have strong reproductive power and unique adaptability. A weed often produces thousands or even hundreds of thousands of tiny seeds. A shepherd's purse can produce more than 20,000 seeds, and a tumbleweed can produce more than 800,000 seeds. The germination power of the seeds can generally be maintained for a long time; plantain seeds can be preserved for more than ten years, and some even longer. Many seeds have thorns or hairs, making it easy to rely on animals to carry them or wind to transport them. Many perennial weeds can also spread and reproduce by means of roots, stems, or their fragments. Fragments of bitter lettuce roots that are ten centimeters long can develop into a root system with a total length of 542 centimeters in one summer, an increase of 54 times the original length.

	Do the endless weeds bring people misfortune or fortune? It depends on our understanding and control of them.

### 野火烧不尽的杂草

    野火烧不尽的杂草
    林薇
    在田间、路旁、水边或山地旷野，一年四季漫生着各种杂草。当这暮春天气，它们更是到处蓬勃滋生，真是野火烧不尽，春风吹又生。
    提起杂草，人们总觉得讨厌。它给我们带来了不少危害：庄稼地里，它夺取了作物所需的养料、水分、空气和阳光，还帮助病虫的蔓延，影响作物的收成量和质量；由于除草，更增加了生产成本。不慎把有毒或有异臭的野草喂了牲口，就会使之中毒或使所产乳品带上异味。在院子里长满了杂草，会使环境变得格外荒凉和不洁，更使蚊蚋有了栖息之所。江南一带，血吸虫的中间寄主——钉螺就最喜欢生活在水边生长的一种野草上面。
    但是，杂草对人类也并不是一无是处，那长在坡地、堤岸或塘边等处的杂草，正是一层最好的天然复盖，防止了水土的冲刷；很多野菜如荠、马兰等可以食用；香附子、夏枯草、半夏等可以治病；不少野草可以作为禽畜的饲料或农田肥料
  （绿肥或堆肥）；有的可以布置庭园，铺成绿茵如毡的草皮；有的还可以作为指示地下有某种矿藏的标志。最近名闻全国的“打破碗花花”，更能帮助我们杀灭蚊蝇。
    杂草大致可分为一年生、越年生、多年生和寄生等四类。一年生杂草大多在春季发芽，到秋冬死亡，如稗子、刺苋、小藜等，都以种子渡过寒冬；越年生种类则在秋季发芽，至第二年夏季死亡，荠、繁缕等，以种子过夏。
    多年生杂草，大多在冬季地上部分的茎叶死去，地下部分还能安全越冬，到次年春季再萌发新芽。如马兰、香附子、白茅等。它们除能以种子繁殖外，还有依靠根、茎等营养器官繁殖的能力。
    寄生杂草不能独立生活，全靠寄生在其他植物上面，如寄生在大豆上的菟丝子。它们也靠种子繁殖。
    杂草之所以到处滋生，不易根除，是因为它们有强大的繁殖力和独特的适应性。一棵杂草往往能结成千上万甚至数十万粒细小的种子。一棵荠就能结种子两万多粒，一株蓬可以结八十万粒以上。种子的发芽力一般又能保持得很久，车前种子能保持十年以上，有的甚至更长。很多种子都带有刺或毛，容易依赖动物的携带或风力的传送。不少多年生杂草更可以用根、茎或它们的断体来蔓延和繁殖，十公分长的苦菜断根在一个夏季可发展到总长达五百四十二公分的根系，比原来长度增加了五十四倍。
    那蔓延不尽的杂草，给人们带来的是祸？是福？取决于我们对它们的了解和控制。
