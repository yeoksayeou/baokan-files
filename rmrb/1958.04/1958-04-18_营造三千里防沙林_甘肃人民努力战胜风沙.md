Creating a Three-Thousand-Li Shelterbelt
The People of Gansu Work Hard to Conquer Wind and Sand

(Our report) The great project of Gansu Province to build a shelterbelt along the Tengger Desert and the Great Wall is progressing rapidly.

This shelterbelt starts from Jingtai County in Dingxi Prefecture in central Gansu, passes through sixteen counties and cities along the Tengger Desert and the ancient Great Wall, and extends to the shore of Hala Lake in Dunhuang County at the westernmost end of the Hexi Corridor, with a total length of more than three thousand li. During the period of the first Five-Year Plan, more than one million mu of young forests have been cultivated, including more than 110 strip afforestation sections, with a total length of more than two thousand li. This spring, the local people exerted great effort, afforesting more than one million mu, surpassing the achievements of several years. Now, in many places, the trees have been connected into belts, and the belts have been connected into networks. Most of the shifting sand areas, which were once full of yellow sand and sand dunes, are now covered with shrubs and grasses. Dunhuang, which has suffered from wind and sand since the Qin and Han dynasties, now has a forest network centered on the county seat, consisting of four main forest belts and many auxiliary forest belts, extending to the surrounding desert.

Along this wind and sand line, more than 1.5 million mu of farmland used to suffer for a long time, and everywhere there was a scene of "a big wind and sand filled the sky, and the people starved for thousands of years," but now those days are gone forever. The four sides of Shuiyuan Township in Yongchang County are Gobi Desert, the climate is dry, and the wind and sand are very strong. Before liberation, farmland and canals were often buried by wind and sand. After several years of hard work, a farmland protection forest network has been formed throughout the township. And it has turned more than 1,800 mu of land that could not be planted due to wind and sand into fertile fields.

Starting this year, within a few years, a basic shelterbelt, three thousand li long and three li wide, will be built on this wind and sand line, along with sixty branch forest belts with a total length of five thousand two hundred li, totaling 44.55 million mu of afforestation. Building such a large-scale shelterbelt is an initiative in China's afforestation cause. After the implementation of this plan, the benefiting area will reach more than 280,000 square kilometers, and the cultivated land area can be expanded by 10 million mu. Natural disasters such as wind, sand, water, and drought will be eradicated in the forest belt area, fundamentally changing the natural appearance of the sixteen counties (cities) on the shelterbelt line. At that time, the vast deserts along the Tengger Desert and the Great Wall in Gansu Province will become a scene where wind does not cause disasters, sand does not migrate, the Gobi becomes an oasis, the desert becomes fertile land, forest belts crisscross, and flowers and fruits become forests, like the scenery south of the Yangtze River beyond the Great Wall.

    营造三千里防沙林
    甘肃人民努力战胜风沙
    本报讯　甘肃省沿着腾格里大沙漠和万里长城营造防沙林的伟大工程进展迅速。
    这条防沙林从甘肃中部定西专区的景泰县起，沿着腾格里大沙漠和古代的万里长城经过十六个县市，延伸到河西走廊最西端敦煌县的哈拉湖畔，全长三千多里。在第一个五年计划期间已营造起幼林一百多万亩，其中有带状造林一百一十多段，总长二千多里。今年春季，当地人民发挥了很大的干劲，造林一百多万亩，超过了几年的成绩。现在，许多地方的树木，已经连点成带，连带成网。过去黄沙遍野、沙丘群立的流沙地带，大多长满灌木草丛。从秦汉时代起就受风沙危害的敦煌，现在以县城为中心，由四条主林带和许多附林带所构成的林网一直延伸到四周的沙漠中去。
    在这条风沙线上，过去有一百五十多万亩农田长期受害，到处是“一阵大风沙满天，百姓千年饿断肠”的情景，而现在这种日子一去不复返了。永昌县水源乡四面都是戈壁滩，气候干燥，风沙很大，解放以前农田、渠道常被风沙埋压。经过几年的努力，已经形成全乡护田林网。并使过去风沙侵袭不能种植的一千八百多亩地变成良田。
    从今年起在几年内，这条防沙线上将营造成长三千华里、宽三华里的一条基干防护林带，六十条总长五千二百华里的支干林带，共计造林四千四百五十五万亩。营造这样大规模的防沙林带，是我国造林事业的创举。这一计划实现以后，受益面积将达二十八万多平方公里，可扩大耕地面积一千万亩，在林带区内将根绝风、沙、水、旱等自然灾害，使防沙线上十六个县（市）的自然面貌根本改观。那时，甘肃省沿着腾格里大沙漠和万里长城内外的辽阔的沙漠，将变成风不成灾，沙不迁移，戈壁成绿洲，沙漠变良田，林带纵横，花果成林的塞外江南。
