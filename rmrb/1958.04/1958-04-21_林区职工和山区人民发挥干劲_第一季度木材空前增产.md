Lumberjacks and People in Mountainous Areas Exert Effort
First Quarter Timber Production Unprecedented

    (Our report) The hundreds of thousands of workers in the nation's forestry areas and the broad masses of people in the mountainous areas have displayed tremendous drive in timber production, completing this year's first quarter timber production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

    According to recent statistics from the Ministry of Forestry, the nation produced a total of 6.72 million cubic meters of timber in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 400,000 cubic meters over the original plan, and an increase of 1.57 million cubic meters over the same period last year, representing an increase of 30.38%. State-owned forestry areas originally planned to produce 3.24 million cubic meters of timber in the first quarter of this year, but actually produced more than 3.89 million cubic meters. The Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Administration has completed more than half of its annual planned output in the first quarter. All employees in the Sichuan forestry area, in the double-anti movement, put forward the fighting slogans of "excavating every bit of strength, seizing every drop of weir water," "climbing high mountains, breaking ice and snow, and developing dead-end forests," breaking through the convention that "timber cannot be transported in the first quarter," and completed the timber felling plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target.

    The cooperative forestry area in the nine southern provinces, despite being in the dry season in the first quarter and also due to insufficient labor, most provinces failed to complete the first quarter timber production plan on time. However, judging from the overall production progress, it is much better than the same period last year. According to recent statistics, the timber output in the forestry areas of the nine southern provinces in the first quarter of this year increased by 24% compared with the same period last year. The timber output in Guangxi region in the first quarter of this year was 155% of the same period last year.

    The labor productivity of the forest industry sector has also increased significantly. In the first quarter of this year, the national labor productivity of timber production, calculated in kind, increased by 12% compared with the same period last year. In the first quarter of last year, the Greater Khingan Mountains forestry area had a total of 22,566 people, producing 590,000 cubic meters of timber. In the first quarter of this year, with only 19,261 people, it produced 1.09 million cubic meters of timber. (Yang Furong)

    林区职工和山区人民发挥干劲
    第一季度木材空前增产
    本报讯　全国林区数十万职工和山区广大人民，在木材生产上发挥了巨大的干劲，提前超额完成了今年第一季度木材生产计划。
    据林业部最近统计，全国今年第一季度共生产木材六百七十二万立方公尺，比原订计划增加四十万立方公尺，比去年同期增加一百五十七万立方公尺，即增产30.38％。国有林区今年第一季度原计划生产木材三百二十四万立方公尺，实际生产了三百八十九万多立方公尺。内蒙古森林工业管理局第一季度已完成全年计划产量的一半以上。四川林区全体职工，在双反运动中提出“挖掘每分力量，抓住每滴堰水”，“跳上高山，踏破冰雪，开发死角林”的战斗口号，冲破了“第一季度不能运出木材”的惯例，提前超额完成了木材采伐计划。
    南方九省合作林区，第一季度虽值枯水季节，又由于劳动力不足，大部省份，没能按时完成第一季度木材生产计划。但从总的生产进展情况来看，比去年同期要好得多。据最近统计，今年第一季度南方九省林区的木材产量，比去年同期增长24％，广西地区今年第一季度的木材产量为去年同期的155％。
    森林工业部门的劳动生产率也有了显著提高。今年第一季度全国木材生产的劳动生产率，按实物计算，比去年同期提高12％。大兴安岭林区去年第一季度共有二万二千五百六十六人，生产木材五十九万立方公尺，今年首季只有一万九千二百六十一人，就生产了一百零九万立方公尺木材。　（杨福荣）
