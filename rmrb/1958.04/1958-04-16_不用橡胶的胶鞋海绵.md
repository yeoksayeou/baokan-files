Tianjin Rubber Experiment Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a type of rubber shoe sponge that contains no rubber components, using polyvinyl chloride. This sponge has strong elasticity, high tensile strength, and is also very soft. When worn on the feet, it does not have the odor of rubber sponge and is also more durable than rubber sponge.

    不用橡胶的胶鞋海绵
    天津市橡胶实验厂最近用聚氯乙烯试制成功一种没有橡胶成份的胶鞋海绵。这种海绵弹力强，拉力大，而且非常柔软，穿在脚上没有橡胶海绵的臭味，还比橡胶海绵耐用。
