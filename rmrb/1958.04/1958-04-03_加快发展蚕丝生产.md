    Accelerate the Development of Silk Production
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    The National Conference on Mulberry and Tussah Silk Production, recently held in Beijing, called on all regions to actively organize a great leap forward in silk production. This is a correct call. In recent years, silk production has made great achievements. The total output of domestic silkworm cocoons has increased by 1.2 times compared to the early days of liberation, tussah silkworm cocoons have increased by 2.4 times, the area of mulberry gardens has doubled, the unit yield per silkworm egg sheet has doubled, and the silk yield per hundred catties of fresh cocoons has increased by 50%. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the state purchased cocoons and silk and invested more than 600 million yuan in rural areas. The total value of silk exports was equivalent to about 5 million tons of steel or 10.73 million tons of chemical fertilizer, which promoted the development of China's industrial construction and agricultural production.
    Although silk production has increased significantly, compared with the development speed of the entire national economy, the increased purchasing power of the people, and the expansion speed of international trade, the growth rate of silk production appears to be lagging behind. At present, silk production can only supply one-third of the domestic market's needs and one-half of the foreign market's demands. The existing equipment capacity of the silk weaving industry is only utilized at 75%. Therefore, a rapid leap forward is necessary.
    China has a long history of sericulture, and the masses have a habit of planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. The climate is mild and suitable for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. There are many mountainous areas, hills, fieldsides, field ridges, roadsides, riverside areas, and vacant land around houses, and planting mulberry trees on a large scale will not compete with grain for land. There are many tussah forests, and less than one-eighth of them are currently being utilized. Developing mountain production and diversified management has become an urgent requirement of the vast number of agricultural cooperatives. China has a large population, with a domestic market of 600 million people. These many favorable conditions all contribute to the realization of the task of developing silk production.
    Some people say that mulberry trees are perennial crops and cannot achieve a leap forward. However, this is not entirely true. The newly planted mulberry trees in the Xiacai Agricultural Cooperative in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, produced 805 catties of leaves per mu in the second year. The newly planted high- and low-trunk integrated fast-growing mulberry garden in the Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative in Haining County produced 192 catties of leaves per mu in the autumn of the same year, and reached 1,264 catties in the second year, which is almost double the current national average yield per mu.
    Some people say that developing sericulture will compete with grain and cotton for land, and mulberry trees cannot be planted on the mountains, and will not grow well on the mountains. This statement is also not in accordance with the facts. In the past three years, the area of expanded mulberry gardens across the country has reached 2 million mu, almost all planted in mountainous and hilly areas. Jiangning County in Jiangsu Province has newly planted 55,000 mu in mountainous and hilly areas, with a survival rate of over 95%. Deqing County in Zhejiang Province produced 15,250 dan of cocoons in the early days of liberation, and 56,000 dan of cocoons in 1957. In terms of grain, it changed from a grain-deficient county to a surplus grain county, and also expanded mulberry gardens by 10,000 mu. Facts have proved that the development of sericulture and grain production can promote each other as long as they are properly arranged.
    Can tussah silk production achieve a leap forward? Yes, it can. Tussah silkworms are raised outdoors, and natural conditions will have a certain impact, but it is not the main factor. Hubei Province has increased by more than 320 times in just three years from trial breeding to promotion. Isn't this a leap?
    To achieve a leap forward in silk production, both sericulture and mulberry cultivation must be given equal importance. The work of cultivating seedlings and planting mulberry trees must be carried out seriously. With mulberry trees, there is a guarantee for raising silkworms. Some areas have already created very good experiences in seedling cultivation and mulberry planting, and various regions should actively promote them.
    Existing mulberry gardens are the basic position for increasing cocoon production at present, and management must be strengthened. Deqing County has put forward the slogan of "1,000 catties of leaves, 100 catties of cocoons," which is entirely possible to achieve, and other regions can also consider doing so. However, it should be recognized that half of the existing mulberry gardens are old mulberry gardens left over from before liberation, with tree ages of more than 30 years, and there are many missing trees. For this part of the mulberry garden, special attention must be paid to strengthening management, gradually updating it, filling in the missing trees, and making the sparse ones denser. The State Council has decided to exempt mulberry gardens from the grain fixed quota task, and agricultural cooperatives should be mobilized to cancel intercropping that is not conducive to mulberry tree growth, and carry out reasonable intercropping or intercropping with green manure, which is not only conducive to mulberry tree growth, but also increases the fertilizer for the mulberry garden. The other half of the existing mulberry gardens were planted after liberation. As long as management is strengthened, the leaf yield can be increased year by year by leaps and bounds. The Yangtze River Basin and areas north of the Yellow River should catch up with or exceed the yield of 1,000 catties of spring leaves per mu in Deqing County, and the South China region should catch up with or exceed the yield of 3,300 catties of leaves per mu on average in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province.
    At present, there are still many mulberry trees that have not been used for raising silkworms. Some have been fully utilized, but the utilization rate is not high. In the future, they should be fully utilized to increase the number of silkworm rearing cycles. South China can change from five or six times to eight times, the Yangtze River Basin can change from two times to four times, and areas north of the Yellow River, Northeast, and Northwest regions can change from two times to three times, striving to raise them four times. Some people say that raising silkworms too many times will affect the growth of mulberry trees. Yes, if fertilization and management are not done well, it will affect the growth of mulberry trees. The farmers in Deqing County say, "Don't be afraid of harvesting mulberry leaves too hard, but be afraid of not investing in the mulberry garden." This shows that as long as management is strengthened and more fertilizer is applied, increasing the number of silkworm rearing cycles will not have any impact. At present, the unit yield per silkworm egg sheet is still very low, generally averaging just over 40 catties; while the unit yield of high-yielding cooperatives is over 80 catties, and the potential for increasing production is still very large.
    The potential for tussah silk production is even greater. At present, only one-eighth of the national tussah forests are utilized, and the cocooning rate per moth is only about 20%. As long as management is strengthened and diseases and insect pests are prevented, the yield can be increased several times. The measures proposed by Liaoning Province to change from extensive to intensive rearing, from dense rearing to sparse rearing, and from outdoor rearing of small silkworms to indoor rearing of small silkworms are all very good methods. Various regions have many high-yield experiences, which should be summarized, organized for visits and comparisons, and comprehensively promoted.
    Ten years depend on three years, and three years depend on the first year. The mulberry gardens required for the ten-year plan's cocoon target must be planted within three years. The mulberry gardens required for the 1962 cocoon target must be completed within the next two years. Only in this way can the completion of the planned target be reliably guaranteed. The "Vernal Equinox" of 1958 has passed, and the silkworm rearing season is approaching. Various regions must seize this great opportunity and earnestly do a good job in collecting mulberry seeds, cultivating mulberry seedlings, opening up new mulberry gardens, and providing technical guidance for silkworm rearing.

    加快发展蚕丝生产
    本报评论员
    最近在北京召开的全国桑蚕、柞蚕生产会议号召各地积极组织蚕丝生产的大跃进，这是正确的号召。几年来蚕丝生产取得了很大成绩。家蚕茧的总产量，比解放初期增加一点二倍，柞蚕茧增加了二点四倍，桑园面积扩大了一倍，每张蚕种的单位产量提高了一倍，每百斤鲜茧出丝量提高了50％。第一个五年计划期间国家收购茧、丝投放到农村的金额达六亿多元，出口丝绸总值约相当于五百万吨钢材，或一千零七十三万吨化学肥料，促进了我国工业建设和农业生产的发展。
    蚕丝生产虽然有了很大的增长，但与整个国民经济的发展速度比较，与广大人民购买力的提高比较，与国际贸易的扩大速度比较，蚕丝生产的增长速度就显得落后了。目前蚕丝生产仅能供应国内市场需要的三分之一，国外市场要求的二分之一。现有丝织工业的设备能力，也只利用了75％。因此必须飞速跃进。
    我国养蚕历史悠久，群众有栽桑养蚕的习惯；气候温和，适宜于栽桑养蚕；山区、丘陵、田边、地埂、道旁、河旁、宅旁空隙地多，大量栽桑不会与粮食争地。现在柞林很多，已利用的不到八分之一。发展山区生产和多种经营已经成为广大农业社的迫切要求。我国人口众多，有六亿人民的国内市场。这许多有利条件，都有助于发展蚕丝生产任务的实现。
    有些人说桑树是多年生作物，不能跃进，事实并不完全如此。浙江省诸暨县下蔡农业社新栽的桑树，第二年每亩产叶即达八百零五斤。海宁县新民农业社栽植的高低干综合速成桑园，当年秋季每亩就产叶一百九十二斤，第二年即达到一千二百六十四斤，比现在全国平均亩产叶量高出将近一倍。
    有人说发展蚕桑生产会与粮棉争地，桑树不能上山，上了山也长不好。这说法也不合事实。近三年来全国扩大的桑园达两百万亩，几乎是全部在山区丘陵栽植的。江苏省江宁县在山区丘陵新栽植了五万五千亩，成活率都在95％以上。浙江省德清县解放初期产茧一万五千二百五十担，1957年产茧五万六千担，粮食方面由原来的缺粮县变为余粮县，同时也扩大了桑园一万亩。事实证明发展蚕桑生产与粮食生产只要安排得当，是可以互相促进的。
    柞蚕生产能不能跃进呢？也能。柞蚕在室外放养，自然条件会发生一定影响，但不是主要的。湖北省从试养到推广仅三年的时间，竟增长了三百二十多倍，这不是飞跃吗？
    要实现蚕丝生产的跃进，必须蚕桑并重。培苗栽桑的工作必须认真的搞起来。有了桑，养蚕才能有保证。在培苗栽桑方面有的地区已经创造了很好的经验，各地应当积极推广。
    现有桑园是目前增加蚕茧产量的基本阵地，必须加强管理。德清县提出“千斤叶、百斤茧”的口号，完全有可能实现，各地也可以考虑这样做。但是应该认识到现在桑园一半是解放以前留下来的老桑园，树龄都有三十年以上，并且缺株很多。对这一部分桑园，必须特别注意加强管理，逐步更新，把缺株的补齐，过稀的补密。国务院已经决定免除桑园的粮食三定任务，应动员农业社取消不利于桑树生长的间作物，进行合理的间作或间作绿肥，这样既有利于桑树生长，又可以增加桑园的肥料。现有桑园的另一半是解放以后栽植的，这一部分桑园只要加强管理，产叶量就可以逐年飞跃增加。长江流域及黄河以北地区应当赶上或超过德清县每亩产春叶一千斤，华南地区应当赶上或超过广东省中山县平均每亩产叶三千三百斤的产量。
    目前还有很多桑树没有用来养蚕。有的虽已全部利用了，但利用率不高。以后应当充分利用起来，增加养蚕次数。华南地区可以改五次六次为八次，长江流域可以改二次为四次，黄河以北、东北、西北地区可以改二次为三次，争取养四次。有人说养蚕次数多了要影响桑树的生长，是的，如果不做好施肥和管理工作，是要影响桑树生长的。德清县农民的话是“不怕桑叶采的狠，就怕桑园不下本”。这说明只要加强管理多施肥，增加养蚕次数是没有影响的。目前每张蚕种的单位产量还很低，一般平均在四十斤多一点；而丰产社的单位产量都在八十斤以上，增产潜力还很大。
    柞蚕生产中的潜力更大。目前全国柞林仅利用了八分之一，每蛾的结茧率只有20％左右。只要加强管理，防除病虫害，产量就可以提高几倍。辽宁省提出的改粗放为细放，改密放为稀放，改室外养小蚕为室内养小蚕，都是很好的办法。各地有很多的丰产经验，应加以总结，组织参观评比，全面推广。
    十年看三年，三年看头年。十年规划的蚕茧指标所需的桑园，必须在三年内拓植完毕。1962年蚕茧指标所需的桑园，必须在今明两年内完成，只有这样，规划指标的完成才有可靠的保证。1958年的“春分”节已过，养蚕季节即将到来，各地必须抓住这个大好时机，切实做好采集桑籽、培育桑苗、开辟新桑园及养蚕的技术指导等工作。
