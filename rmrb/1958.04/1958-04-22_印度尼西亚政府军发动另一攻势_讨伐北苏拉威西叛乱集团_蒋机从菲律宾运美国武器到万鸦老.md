(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) Xinhua News Agency: Lieutenant Colonel Rukminto of the Indonesian Army Headquarters has been appointed commander of military operations in North Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi. After his inauguration in Palu on the 18th, Rukminto commanded government troops to launch an offensive against the rebels in North Sulawesi.

It is reported that the Ministry of the Interior has announced the establishment of a first-level autonomous region in Central Sulawesi, with Palu as its capital. So far, most of Central Sulawesi has been liberated from the rebels.

On the other hand, on the eve of the final defeat of the Hussein rebel group in Central Sumatra, the imperialists are trying to strengthen the rebel group in North Sulawesi. According to the Indonesian National News Agency, a large number of American-made weapons have recently appeared in Manado, the center of the North Sulawesi rebel group's activities. Almost every day, planes of the Chiang Kai-shek clique travel between Manado and the Philippines, making connections for the rebel group and foreign subversion groups, and transporting American weapons to the rebels.

North Sulawesi is surrounded by the sea on three sides, and local rebels have convenient sea and air transportation links with the imperialists. North Sulawesi is north of the Philippines and northwest of British Borneo. There are many small islands between the Philippines and North Sulawesi that can be used as stepping stones for travel.

The Indonesian National News Agency also reported that many people in rebel uniforms who cannot speak Indonesian have recently appeared in Manado, and it is speculated that they are members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. They told merchants in Manado that they came from small islands near Manado and were sent here to train the rebels in the use of American weapons. In addition, a group of people who used to serve in the Dutch East Indies colonial army have now been rearmed by the rebels.

According to a live recording report by Indonesian Republic Radio reporter Sugondo from Padang, he personally saw many brand-new American-made automatic and semi-automatic weapons abandoned by the fleeing rebels. The radio station broadcast Sugondo's report on the evening of the 20th, saying that foreign amphibious aircraft were discovered on Lake Singkarak, located between Padang and Bukittinggi. The commander of the government army front has ordered the air force to attack the Singkarak area.

    印度尼西亚政府军发动另一攻势
    讨伐北苏拉威西叛乱集团
    蒋机从菲律宾运美国武器到万鸦老
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：印度尼西亚陆军司令部的鲁克明托中校已经被任命为指挥北苏拉威西和中苏拉威西军事行动的司令。鲁克明托18日在巴鲁举行了就职仪式之后，就指挥政府军向北苏拉威西叛军发动攻势。
    据悉，内政部已经宣布要筹建中苏拉威西的一级自治区，以巴鲁为首府。到目前为止，中苏拉威西的大部分地区已经从叛乱分子手中解放出来了。
    另一方面，在中苏门答腊侯赛尼叛乱集团面临着最后失败的前夕，帝国主义者正在努力加强北苏拉威西的叛乱集团。据印度尼西亚民族通讯社报道，北苏拉威西叛乱集团活动中心万鸦老最近出现了大批美制武器。几乎每一天都有蒋介石集团的飞机在万鸦老和菲律宾之间来往，为叛乱集团和外国颠覆集团进行联系，并且给叛乱分子运送美国武器。
    北苏拉威西三面靠海，当地叛乱分子同帝国主义者之间有着很方便的海空交通联系。北苏拉威西的北面是菲律宾，西北是英属婆罗洲。在菲律宾同北苏拉威西之间分布着许多小岛，可以用作来往的跳板。
    印度尼西亚民族通讯社还报道说，最近在万鸦老出现了许多穿叛军制服而不会说印度尼西亚话的人，人们猜测他们是蒋介石集团分子。他们对万鸦老的商人说，他们是从万鸦老附近的小岛上来的，他们是被派到这里来训练叛乱分子使用美国武器的。此外，一批从前当过荷属印度尼西亚殖民军的人现在已经被叛乱分子重新武装起来。
    据印度尼西亚共和国电台随军记者苏贡多从巴东发出的现场录音报道说，他亲眼看到了溃逃的叛乱分子所遗弃的许多崭新的美国制造的自动武器和半自动武器。这个电台20日晚上广播苏贡多的报道说，在位于巴东和武吉丁宜之间的辛卡腊克湖上，发现了外国的水陆两用飞机。政府军前线司令官已经命令空军袭击辛卡腊克地区。
