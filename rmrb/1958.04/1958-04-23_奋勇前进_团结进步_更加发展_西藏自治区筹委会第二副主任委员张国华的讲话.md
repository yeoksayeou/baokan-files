The Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established for exactly two years, from April 22, 1956, to today. We are here today to warmly celebrate the achievements of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region during these two years, and my mood is as happy as everyone else.

In the past two years, thanks to the correct leadership and care of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the direct leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, the support of the broad masses of monks and lay people, and the unity and cooperation and joint efforts of all Tibetan and Han cadres, the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region has done many things that are beneficial to the people of Tibet and the development of Tibet; it has made many work decisions that are beneficial to the development of the people of Tibet, such as the resolution passed in 1957 on exempting personnel and students of all ethnic groups in Tibet who participate in state organs from personal corvée taxes, which further provided favorable conditions for the extremely important work of cultivating cadres. In order to gradually establish the transportation order in Tibet, decisions such as the "Measures for the Management of Private Cars in the Tibet Region" and the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Animal-Drawn Vehicles in the Tibet Region" were made. In particular, according to the central government's policy of "no democratic reforms for six years," the organization and personnel were successfully contracted appropriately, and unnecessary institutions and personnel were reduced, avoiding the waste of manpower and material resources. This has enabled our institutions and work to better adapt to the central government's policy of "no changes for six years." In addition, certain achievements have been made in economic, cultural, medical and health, anti-imperialist patriotic work, and propaganda and education on "no changes for six years." At the same time, due to the streamlining of institutions and the allocation of personnel, the enthusiasm and initiative of Tibetan cadres in their work have been better brought into play.

In the process of achieving successes and overcoming shortcomings, the unity between ethnic groups and within the Tibetan ethnic group has been further strengthened, the patriotic awareness of the Tibetan people and their understanding of the organizations of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region have been enhanced, and they have further realized that the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region is a progressive organization, an organ with the nature of political power responsible for preparing for the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region. The facts of the work done by the Preparatory Committee in the past two years have given a powerful and fatal blow to the reactionary nonsense of imperialism and pro-imperialist separatist elements who slander the Preparatory Committee as a "Han people's organ."

Regarding the issue of patriotic education and socialist education, we have made achievements and attached importance to it in the past. In the work arrangements of the Preparatory Committee in 1958, it was emphasized again that "conducting a profound patriotic and socialist education, and combining it with opposition to great-Han chauvinism and local nationalism," which is very important and very correct. We know that: no matter what the historical facts and the current facts fully show, the Communist Party of China is the true representative and defender of the interests of all ethnic groups in our country, and it always adheres to the principle of national equality and the protection of freedom of religious belief, and the socialist system is an advanced social system with incomparable superiority. Therefore, the high development of Tibet's political, economic, and cultural undertakings, like other fraternal ethnic groups, is only possible under the leadership of the Communist Party and by taking the socialist road. To take the socialist road and to love the motherland, we must first oppose both local nationalism and great-Han chauvinism at the same time. Local nationalism and great-Han chauvinism are both bourgeois ideas, both are ideological toxins used by imperialism and all other counter-revolutionary elements to carry out disruptive activities such as inciting ethnic relations, and both are incompatible with socialism. Because patriotism and taking the socialist road are consistent, local nationalism is incompatible with patriotism. Therefore, this issue is related to whether the Tibetan ethnic group in Tibet can develop, prosper, and progress, and whether it can join the ranks of advanced ethnic groups and become a socialist ethnic group. It is a fundamental issue; at the same time, it is also a fundamental issue related to the unity and consolidation of the great motherland. On this issue, in the past few years, we have focused on opposing great-Han chauvinism, which is completely correct. However, according to the current situation, while continuing to oppose great-Han chauvinism, we must put forward the opposition to local nationalism. Otherwise, the development of local nationalism will endanger the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity, and will seriously hinder the development and progress of the Tibetan people, and even prevent them from ever getting rid of that state of poverty and backwardness. In view of the great harm of local nationalism, we must resolutely oppose it.

When commemorating the second anniversary of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, under the favorable international situation of the East wind prevailing over the West wind, and encouraged by the great leap forward in socialist construction across the country, we must hold high the banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism, unite and progress and develop further, strive forward, further strengthen ethnic unity, do a good job in the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front work and the anti-imperialist, patriotic, and socialist propaganda and education work, earnestly do the specific work of the Preparatory Committee's work arrangements for 1958, study hard, and improve our patriotic awareness and political and ideological level. Let the work in Tibet, under the direct leadership of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, the Dalai Lama, and Panchen Erdeni, achieve more and greater results than before.

### 奋勇前进　团结进步　更加发展  西藏自治区筹委会第二副主任委员张国华的讲话

    奋勇前进　团结进步　更加发展
    西藏自治区筹委会第二副主任委员张国华的讲话
    西藏自治区筹备委员会从1956年4月22日成立到今天，已经整整两周年了。为了庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会在这两年期间所取得的成就，我们今天在这里热烈的集会纪念，我的心情和大家一样也是十分愉快的。
    两年来，由于中央和毛主席的正确领导与关怀，由于中共西藏工委、达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的直接领导，由于广大僧俗人民的支持以及全体藏、汉族工作人员的团结合作、共同努力，西藏自治区筹备委员会做了许多有益于西藏人民的西藏发展事业；做出了许多有益于西藏人民的发展的工作决定，如1957年通过了关于免去西藏各族人民参加国家机关工作的人员、学员的人役税的决议，为培养干部这样一个极为重要的工作，进一步提供了有利的条件。为了逐渐建立西藏的交通秩序，作出了“关于西藏地区私人汽车管理办法”和“西藏地区兽力车暂行管理办法”等决定。尤其是根据中央“六年不进行民主改革”的方针，顺利地完成了组织机构和人员的适当收缩工作、裁减了不必要的机构和人员，避免了人力物力的浪费。使得我们的机构和工作更好的适应中央“六年不改”的方针。此外，在经济、文化、医疗卫生、反帝爱国和关于“六年不改”的宣传教育等各项工作上，均取得了一定的成绩。同时由于机构紧缩、人员的调配，更好地发挥了藏族干部工作的积极性和主动性。
    在取得成绩和克服缺点的过程中，进一步加强了民族间和西藏藏族内部的团结，提高了西藏人民的爱国主义觉悟和对西藏自治区筹备委员会组织的认识，使他们进一步认识到西藏自治区筹备委员会是一个进步的组织，是负责筹备成立西藏自治区的带政权性质的机关。筹委会两年来所作工作的事实，给予帝国主义和亲帝分离主义分子诬蔑筹备委员会为“汉人机关”的反动胡说以有力的致命回击。
    关于爱国主义教育和社会主义教育问题，过去我们是作得有成绩，也是重视的。筹备委员会在1958年工作安排中，又强调提出：“进行一次深刻的爱国主义和社会主义教育，并结合反对大民族主义和地方民族主义”，这是非常重要非常正确的。我们知道：不管过去的历史事实和当今的事实都充分说明，中国共产党是我国各族人民利益的真正代表者和维护者，是永远坚持民族平等和保护宗教信仰自由原则的，社会主义制度是具有无比优越的先进社会制度。因而西藏政治、经济、文化事业的高度发展，同样的和其他兄弟民族一样，只有在共产党领导之下，走社会主义道路才是可能的。要走社会主义道路，要爱祖国，就必须首先同时反对地方民族主义和大汉族主义。地方民族主义和大汉族主义，同样都是资产阶级思想，都是帝国主义和其他一切反革命分子利用来进行挑拨民族关系等破坏活动的思想毒素，都是同社会主义不相容的。由于爱国主义和走社会主义道路是一致的，因此，地方民族主义是同爱国主义不相容的。所以这个问题是关系着西藏藏族能否发展、繁荣，能否进步，能否跻于先进民族行列成为社会主义民族的带根本性质的问题；同时也是关系着伟大祖国的统一和巩固的根本问题。在这个问题上，过去几年来，我们曾着重讲了反对大汉族主义，这是完全正确的。但是根据目前情况，在继续反对大汉族主义的同时，就必须提出反对地方民族主义。否则，地方民族主义发展下去，就会危害于祖国的统一和民族团结，就会使西藏人民的发展、进步受到严重的阻碍，甚至永远不能摆脱那种贫困的落后状态。鉴于地方民族主义危害之大，我们必须坚决反对。
    在纪念西藏自治区筹备委员会成立两周年的时候，在东风压倒西风的有利国际形势下，在全国社会主义建设大跃进的鼓舞下，我们要高举反帝爱国的旗帜，团结进步更加发展，奋勇前进，进一步加强民族团结，做好反帝爱国统一战线工作和反帝爱国、社会主义的宣传教育工作，认真做好筹委会关于1958年工作安排的具体工作，努力学习，提高爱国主义觉悟和政治思想水平。使西藏的工作在中共西藏工委、达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的直接领导下，取得比以前更多更大的成绩。
