    Women of Lushan County Display Great Skill in Technical Innovation
    Creating and Improving 158 Kinds of New Tools, More Than 32,000 Pieces

    (By this newspaper) According to a report in the Henan Daily: In the upsurge of comprehensive technical reform in Lushan County, the broad masses of women have also brought their infinite wisdom and strength into play, creating many amazing miracles and promoting the leap-forward development of production and construction. Statistics as of the beginning of this month show that women throughout the county have created, improved, and copied more than 32,300 new tools of various types, including those for water lifting, soil transportation, plowing, land leveling, fertilizer accumulation, replanting, weeding, grass cutting, pest control, eliminating the four pests, and simplifying housework, totaling 158 kinds. Wen Xianglan, an agricultural labor model and head of the Fengli Cooperative in Malou Township, created a wooden-rail soil transportation vehicle, which increased soil transportation efficiency by more than 30 times. Cooperative members Li Xiulian and five other women, using their rest time from labor, collectively researched and improved a four-purpose integrated waterwheel powered by wind, water, manual, and pedal power, with a water output four to five times higher than that of the Liberation-style waterwheel. Liu Yuqi, a 76-year-old woman from Yuecun Township, worked with carpenters and blacksmiths to create and improve 27 kinds of tools, totaling 81 pieces. Female cooperative members of the seventh team of Malou First Cooperative collectively created a hand-cranked mill, which can be operated by one person to grind 800 jin of grain per day, increasing efficiency by 11 times compared to an ordinary stone mill.
    These new tools have played a significant role in promoting the overall great leap forward in production and construction throughout the county and have resolved the contradiction between women's participation in production and managing household chores. According to statistics from the Xiao'ercheng Agricultural Cooperative in the county, before the creation of new tools to simplify housework, the attendance rate of the cooperative's 112 laborers was only 85%; after using the new tools, it reached full attendance.
    Women account for 30% of the more than 1,800 "Zhuge Liang" research groups organized throughout the county. The technical reform committees organized by various townships also have women's federation organizations participating in leadership. Some township Party committees have also specifically convened meetings of Party members, League members, and cadres, as well as blacksmith and carpenter meetings, to educate them to support women's technical reform work in all aspects and to help women learn basic technical knowledge.

    鲁山妇女大显革新技术的本领
    创造改良新工具一百五十八种三万多件
    本报讯　据河南日报消息：在鲁山县掀起全面技术改革的高潮中，广大妇女群众也发挥了无穷的智慧和力量，创造出了许多惊人的奇迹，推动了生产建设的飞跃发展。截至本月上旬统计：全县妇女已经创造、改良和仿制出各种新工具三万二千三百多件，包括提水、运土、翻地、平整土地、积肥、补种、拔草、铡草、治虫、除四害和简化家务劳动等，共一百五十八种。农业劳动模范、马楼乡丰丽社社长文香兰，创造出一部木轨运土车，使运土效率提高三十多倍。社员李秀莲等六个妇女，利用劳动休息时间，集体研究改良了一部风力、水力、手摇、脚踏四用综合水车，出水量比解放式水车提高四、五倍。岳村乡七十六岁的老大娘刘玉奇，和木工、铁工一起，创造改良了各种工具二十七种，共八十一件。马楼一社七队的女社员集体创造的手摇磨，一个人操作，每天能磨八百斤粮食。比一般石磨提高效率十一倍。
    这些新工具，对促进全县生产建设的全面大跃进，起了很大的推动作用，并解决了妇女参加生产与管理家务的矛盾。据该县小尔城农业社的统计，全社一百一十二个劳动力，在没有创造简化家务劳动的新工具以前，出勤率只达到85％，运用新工具后，则达到全勤。
    在全县所组织的一千八百多个“诸葛亮”研究小组中，妇女就占到30％。各乡组织的技术改革委员会，也都有妇联组织参加领导。有的乡党委还专门召开党团员和干部会，以及铁工、木工会，教育他们从各方面支持妇女开展技术改革工作，帮助妇女学习基本技术知识。
