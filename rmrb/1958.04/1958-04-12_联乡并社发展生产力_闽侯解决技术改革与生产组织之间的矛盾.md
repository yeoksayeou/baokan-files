Combining Townships and Merging Communes to Develop Productivity
Minhou Solves the Contradiction Between Technological Reform and Production Organization

(This newspaper dispatch) In the great leap forward in agriculture, several townships and many communes in Minhou County, Fujian Province, have joined together in a large-scale alliance and cooperation to carry out agricultural technology reform and build a new socialist countryside.

The Chenmen, Xiayang, and Longjiang townships in Minhou County have a total of twenty-three agricultural cooperatives. This year, these agricultural cooperatives are striving for a great leap forward, aiming to increase grain yield per unit area from last year's 1,020 jin per mu to 2,040 jin per mu. The fertilizer application per mu is to be increased from 150 dan last year to more than 400 dan, and the two-crop system is to be changed to a three-crop system of rice and wheat. To achieve this leap forward plan, large-scale technological reforms are needed in cultivation, irrigation, transportation, and other aspects. This requires a large amount of capital to purchase tractors and double-wheel double-share plows to implement mechanized cultivation, unified planning of land use, and construction of roads reaching in all directions. It also requires the implementation of mechanical irrigation, the unified construction and adjustment of irrigation canals in large areas of paddy fields based on water sources, and the unified adjustment and use of the irrigation stations in various townships. However, these large-scale measures are beyond the capacity of a single township or commune's manpower and resources. Even if they are carried out, it is not easy to ensure rational and full utilization. For example, the several mechanical irrigation stations built successively by the agricultural cooperatives in these townships have a total of eight water pumps and water turbine pumps. According to the capacity of these machines, they can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land, which can fully meet the needs of the agricultural cooperatives. However, these irrigation stations were built by individual communes, and the irrigation canals were dug according to the needs of each commune. As a result, only more than 5,000 mu of land were irrigated by the eight machines, and more than half of the paddy fields in each township still need to be irrigated by manual water wheels. In addition, the agricultural cooperatives are accumulating large amounts of fertilizer this year, universally reforming the cropping system, and adopting advanced technologies on a large scale. Agricultural work is particularly busy, and it is not easy for a single township or commune to rationally arrange labor. The problem of labor shortage is very acute.

In order to solve this new contradiction between the manpower and resources of small units of one township and one commune and the great leap forward in agriculture, the responsible cadres of the Minhou County Party Committee stationed in these townships and the party and government cadres of each township went deep into each township and commune in early March to study and solve this new problem with the masses. After in-depth research and discussion, people from all levels in each township realized that under this new situation, it is necessary to take the road of large-scale alliance and cooperation for production and construction. Therefore, Chenmen, Xiayang, and Longjiang townships were merged into one large township, and the twenty-three agricultural cooperatives were merged into one joint commune, divided into eleven sub-communes. In the large-scale rural technological reform movement, unified planning and comprehensive cooperation are carried out for major construction projects, and mutual cooperation and support between communes are promoted. A joint work team composed of county and district cadres stationed in each township is organized to direct the technological reform movement and current production activities in each commune.

Under the command of the joint work team and the joint commune, the agricultural cooperatives have carried out unified planning for mechanized cultivation, mechanized irrigation, and road construction. In addition to the sixty-six double-wheel double-share plows already purchased, the communes will collectively invest in the purchase of five tractors and other cultivating machinery this year to establish a joint tractor station. The communes have also decided to break down the boundaries between communes and townships according to the needs of the irrigation area, uniformly construct and adjust the irrigation system, and uniformly use the mechanical irrigation stations of each commune. In the past month, the technological reform movement in the township has made rapid progress. The eleven sub-communes have built more than seventeen kilometers of main roads and cart paths accessible to tractors and automobiles, built thirty-eight irrigation canals and mountain ponds, and uniformly adjusted the irrigation canal network, increasing the irrigation capacity of the original pumping stations in each commune by more than double. All 12,800 mu of paddy fields have achieved mechanized irrigation. Because the cultivated area was unified and the irrigation network was adjusted, many small irrigation and drainage canals and ridges can be leveled into paddy fields. Preliminary calculations show that 1,000 mu of paddy fields can be added, which is equivalent to more than one-tenth of the original total area of paddy fields. In the first year, grain production can be increased by more than one million jin.

Under mutual support and cooperation, the spring production campaign in the communes has been carried out very successfully. The amount of fertilizer accumulated has reached more than 80% of the spring fertilization plan, accumulating nearly 300 dan of fertilizer per mu of land, which is twice the amount of fertilizer applied in the spring of last year. The early rice seedlings have been cultivated particularly well, and transplanting will begin ahead of schedule. The number of trees planted has also reached more than 500,000. At present, the communes are also jointly building eleven biogas power stations, striving to use electricity for production as soon as possible.

    联乡并社发展生产力
    闽侯解决技术改革与生产组织之间的矛盾
    本报讯　在农业大跃进声中，福建省闽侯县几乡多社大联合大协作，进行农业技术改革，建设社会主义新农村。
    闽侯县城门、下洋和龙江等乡共有二十三个农业合作社。今年，这些农业社力争大跃进，粮食单位产量要由去年亩产一千零二十斤跃进到二千零四十斤，每亩施肥量要由去年一百五十担增加到四百多担，还要改二熟为稻、麦三熟。要实现这个跃进规划，就要在耕作、灌溉、交通等多方面进行大规模的技术改革。这就要用较多的资金购买拖拉机和双轮双铧犁等，实行机械耕作，要统一规划土地的使用和修建四通八达的道路；还要实行机械灌溉，要根据水源，在大片水田里统一修建和调整灌溉渠道，统一调整和统一使用各乡的机器灌溉站等等。而这些大规模的措施，已经不是一乡一社的人力、物力所能办到的，即使办起来了，也不容易作到合理和充分的利用。例如这几个乡各农业社先后建设的几个机械灌溉站，共有八部抽水机和水轮泵。按这些机器的能力，可以灌溉一万多亩田，完全可以满足各农业社的需要。但是，这些灌溉站都是以社为单位建设的，灌溉渠道也都是按照各社需要开挖的，所以八部机器只灌溉了五千多亩田，各乡还有一半以上的水田要用人力车水灌溉。又如各农业社今年大量积肥，普遍改革耕作制度和大面积采用先进技术，农活特别繁忙，一乡一社已经不容易合理安排劳动力，人力不足的问题十分尖锐。
    为了解决这个一乡一社小单位的人力物力与农业大跃进不相适应的新矛盾，驻在这几个乡的中共闽侯县委会负责干部和各乡的党政干部，3月初深入各乡各社，和群众一道研究解决这个新问题。经过深入的研究和讨论，各乡上上下下都认识到，在这种新情况下，必须走大联合大协作进行生产建设的道路。于是，便把城门、下洋、龙江等乡合为一个大乡，把二十三个农业社合并为一个联社，下分十一个分社。在大规模的农村技术改革运动中，对各项大的建设进行统一规划、全面合作，提倡社与社之间互相协作、相互支援。并且由驻各乡的县、区干部等组成联合工作组，指挥各社的技术改革运动和当前生产活动。
    各农业社在联合工作组和联社的指挥下，对机械耕作、机械灌溉和修建道路等进行了统一的规划。各社除已购回六十六部双轮双铧犁外，今年还将集体投资购买五部拖拉机和其他耕作机械，建立联合拖拉机站。各社还决定按灌溉区域的需要，打破社界、乡界，统一修建和调整灌溉系统，统一使用各社的机械灌溉站。一个月来，全乡的技术改革运动进展很快。十一个分社已修筑起可通行拖拉机、汽车的主干路和板车道十七公里以上，修建了灌溉渠道和山塘等三十八处，统一调整了灌溉渠道网，使各社原来的抽水机站灌溉能力提高一倍多，全部一万二千八百多亩水田都实现了机械灌溉。因为统一规划了耕作区和调整了灌溉网，很多灌水、排水的小河渠和田埂可以平整为水田。初步计算，可增加水田一千亩，约相当于原来全部水田面积的十分之一以上，第一年就可多增产粮食一百多万斤。
    在互相支援和协作下，各社春季大生产运动进行得很出色。积肥量已达春季施肥计划的80％以上，为每亩田积了近三百多担肥料，相当于去年春季施肥量的二倍；早稻秧苗培育得特别茁壮，插秧工作就将提前开始；植树数量也已达五十多万株。现在，各社还在共同筹建十一处沼气发电站，争取早日利用电力进行生产。
