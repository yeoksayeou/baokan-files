    Read Some Books Seriously
    Bai Yuan
    "The scholar doesn't step out of his gate, yet knows all the affairs under heaven." This is an old saying. Why is the scholar so remarkably resourceful? It turns out that the only magic weapon he relies on is books. In fact, this is just bluffing. There has never been a scholar who can truly understand the affairs of the world without going out. If one spends their life confined within four walls, unable to distinguish between the five grains or the six domestic animals, then the value of what this scholar knows about the world is highly questionable.

    It is said that there is also an old saying in foreign countries: "Books are the source of knowledge." At first glance, it seems completely correct; but upon closer examination, it may not be entirely true. Knowledge, in the final analysis, originates from practice. Therefore, the ultimate source of knowledge is practice, and books are merely a generalization or summary of the experiences (practice) of struggle by predecessors or contemporaries.

    Books are inherently one-sided, but the knowledge gained from practice also tends to be knowledge of a local nature; it is also one-sided. Combining the two one-sided aspects, that is, combining the knowledge gained from practical work with the knowledge gained from books, can lead to more comprehensive knowledge. Knowledge gained from practice can also be used to elevate, modify, or supplement the knowledge in books, transforming it into theory, which in turn guides practice.

    However, there is a habit: people who do practical work don't read much, and people who read don't have much contact with reality. The result is very bad. Our ancestors had two heroic sayings: "Read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles!" If you don't stick to the literal meaning and understand its spirit, then, "read ten thousand books" means you should read more books, and you might as well read more categories; "travel ten thousand miles" means you should work yourself, and also look around, think, listen, talk, and speak. Only in this way, only in this way, will you not become a slave to book knowledge; conversely, you will not become a short-sighted "practitioner" who only sees the trees and not the forest.

    For those who do practical work, it is indeed not easy to "break" ten thousand books, and it is also rarely possible. It is enough to read a few more books. Anything that is essence—that is, books that relatively accurately summarize the life and production struggle experiences of predecessors, or so-called "good books"—should be read repeatedly, tirelessly, thousands of times, "breaking" them, so that one can gain "skill." The meaning of "breaking" is to understand, citing one's own experience, integrating and understanding, so that book knowledge can become a tool you master. Why read repeatedly? This is because you will constantly encounter new situations and new problems in your practical work, and your own thoughts will also constantly change. "Good books" that have been tested can provide new insights each time they are reread, either deepening your understanding or correcting your mistakes. There is an ancient saying: "Reviewing the old and knowing the new." This is in accordance with dialectics. Therefore, "breaking" one or several exemplary good books on a problem or in a discipline can be compared to capturing a main fortress in battle. Once this battle is won, the rest can be easily resolved by a mopping-up operation.

    "Even a clever woman cannot cook without rice"—what to do if there is no time to read? There are ways: first, make up your mind; second, find the right method. If you are determined to read a little, you will naturally be able to squeeze out time to read; and the so-called "getting the method" is actually very simple, called: "cherish every minute"!—The ancients said that every inch of time is precious; a Western proverb says "time is money." But it is a bit too extravagant to cherish "inches" of time only when they are about to pass, I think we must be meticulous and calculate carefully, for example: cherish "minutes" of time. Darwin, who wrote the book "On the Origin of Species," is said to have never had five or ten minutes of leisure—he made use of every five or ten-minute gap. People waste so many five minutes in their lives! Sometimes, one waits for the bus for an unknown number of five minutes in a day! If six five-minute segments are used every day, half an hour can be squeezed out. Some time ago, I went to the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, and I happened to see a group of workers going from the workshop to the canteen at noon after work. It probably took three to five minutes to walk, and a young female worker was reading a book while walking, which was very moving. I must quickly declare: I am not advocating reading while walking, otherwise wouldn't it be terrible to be hit by a car? This is just an example to illustrate that when you are determined to learn, you can always squeeze out time. As for where to squeeze it out, everyone has their own conditions, and there is no need to seek uniformity. Since that young female worker can read while walking, why can't we who do practical work learn while working? Make up your mind, read a little every day, "habit becomes nature"! The days of a bright window, a clean desk, fasting and bathing, and then sitting upright to read will probably never come.

    认真读些书
    柏园
    “秀才不出门，能知天下事。”这是一句老话。秀才为什么如此神通广大？原来他所依靠的唯一法宝，是书本。其实这是唬人的，不出门的秀才而能真正通晓天下事，从来是没有的。如果一生关在四壁之内，结果五谷不分，六畜不辨，那么，这位秀才所知道的天下事究竟有多少价值，一定是大可怀疑的了。
    外国据说也有句老话，叫做：“书籍是知识的源泉。”乍一看，完全对；其实寻根问底，也未必尽然。知识这东西，归根结蒂是从实践中产生的，因此知识的最终源泉是实践，书本不过是前人或今人斗争经验（实践）的概括或总结罢了。
    书本是带有片面性质的东西，但是从实践中得来的知识也往往是另带有局部性质的知识，还是一个片面。把两个片面合起来，即把实际工作所得到的知识和从书本上得到的知识结合起来，那才能得到比较全面的知识。从实际所得的知识也可以靠此上升、修改或补充原来书本的知识，变成为理论，反过来再指导实际了。
    然而有这么一种习惯：做实际工作的人不大读书；读书的人也不大接触实际。这结果是很不妙的。我们的先人有过两句豪迈的语言：破万卷书，行万里路！如果你不拘泥字面，从精神上去理解它的含义，那么，破万卷书——是让你多读点书，读书的门类也不妨多些；行万里路——自己工作，也到处去看看，想想，听听，谈谈，讲讲，这样，也只有这样，你才不致于成为书本知识的奴隶；反之，也不会变成鼠目寸光，只见树木不见森林的“实际家”。
    对于做实际工作的人，要“破”万卷书，确实是不容易的，而且也很少可能。多读几本也就足矣。凡是精华——也就是比较正确地概括了前人生活和生产斗争经验的书本，或者说是“好书”，应该反复的读，不厌其烦的读上千遍，把它读“破”，那才能生取“巧”来。读“破”之意在于通，引证自己的经验，加以融会贯通，书本知识才能够成为你所掌握的工具。为什么要反复读呢？这就是因为你在实际工作中不断会接触到新的状况，新的问题，自己的思想也不断会起变化，经过检验的“好书”，在每一次重读时，都能够有新的体会，或者加深自己的认识，或者修正自己的错误。古语叫做“温故而知新”。这是合乎辩证法的。所以在一个问题上或在一门学问上读“破”一本或几本典范性的好书，可以比喻在作战中攻克一个主力堡垒，这一仗打胜，其余只消用扫荡战就可以顺利的解决残敌了。
    “巧妇难为无米炊”——没有时间读书呀，怎么办？办法是有的，一要下决心，二要得其法。如果你决心要读点书，你自然能够挤出时间来读；而所谓“得法”，其实也很简单，叫做：“惜分阴”！——古人说，一寸光阴也是顶宝贵的；西谚说“时间即金钱”。但到了“寸”阴才去惜，也未免太阔气了，我看必须精打细算，比方说：惜“分”阴。做“物种起源”这本书的达尔文，据说是从来没有什么五分钟十分钟的闲暇的——五分钟十分钟的空隙他也利用上了。人的一生不知浪费了多少个五分钟！有时一天等公共汽车也白白等了不知多少个五分钟呢！一天如果有六段五分钟都利用上了，半个钟头的时间就挤出来了。前些时候到过上海江南造船厂，中午下班刚好碰上一群工人由车间上食堂去，大约要走三五分钟吧，一个年青女工就一边走路一边看书，十分令人感动。我要赶紧声明：我并非提倡走路看书，否则被汽车碰坏了岂不糟糕？这不过是举一个例，说明当你下决心学习时，总归能挤出时间来的。至于从哪里去挤，各人有各人的条件，不必求一致。既然那位年青女工能够边走边看，为什么我们做实际工作的人不能够边做边学呢？下了决心，天天读一点，“习惯成自然”！窗明几净、斋戒沐浴，然后正襟危坐来读书的日子，恐怕永远不会有的。
