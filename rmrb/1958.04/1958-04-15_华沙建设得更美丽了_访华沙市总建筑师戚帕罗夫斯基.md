    Warsaw is Being Built More Beautifully
    ——An Interview with Warsaw City Chief Architect, Chiparovsky
    Our Correspondent, Li Ke
    One morning, in a small building near the banks of the Vistula River, we visited Comrade Chiparovsky, the Chief Architect of Warsaw, and asked him to talk about the construction of Warsaw. With a joyful and excited mood, he introduced his beloved cause to us.
    Six Industrial Zones
    Comrade Chiparovsky first said: "Warsaw today is a city of production. After the Second World War, we built six industrial zones here. The Zeran Industrial Zone, for example, was built entirely on wasteland. These industrial zones are constantly expanding, and they possess many famous factories, such as the Zeran Automobile Factory, the Motorcycle Factory, the Radio Factory, and the Lathe Factory, which are providing the country with first-class quality products. In addition, we are building a new steel plant in the northern district of Warsaw. By 1961, this factory will be able to produce 300,000 tons of steel for the country every year. A new workers' village capable of housing 14,000 people is also under construction near the factory, which is for the future steelworkers to live in.
    "Pre-war Warsaw, although it also had industry, was basically a city of consumption filled with bureaucratic administrative institutions. Today's Warsaw is a city of production, and its industrial output has expanded four times compared to pre-war levels. The class composition of the city's residents has also changed greatly. Of Warsaw's current 1.1 million residents, more than half, nearly 600,000, are workers and staff, including 260,000 industrial workers and construction workers. The construction of Warsaw is to serve production and these laborers."
    Twenty-Eight Residential Areas
    Comrade Chiparovsky then talked about Warsaw's residential construction, saying: "Warsaw now has 536,000 rooms. Except for 160,000 rooms that were restored on the basis of damaged old houses, all the others are newly built. We call a building complex with more than 5,000 residents, and attached shops, schools, and hospitals, a residential area. Warsaw has 28 such residential areas. Many of these residential areas have a population of more than 40,000, like a real small city. Warsaw's famous residential areas, Branov, New Swat, and Makotov, have residents living in quiet, comfortable, and convenient homes. The houses all have modern equipment, and 85% of the houses have heating equipment. Before the war, a capitalist could occupy many rooms, while workers' families had to squeeze four or five people into a small room. This situation has long been changed. On average, the city has roughly two people occupying one room.
    "Currently, there are still 75,000 people in Warsaw with poor living conditions," Comrade Chiparovsky added here, "Paris has 500,000 people living in slums. However, when I say that some people in Warsaw have poor living conditions, I mean that they live in cramped and old houses, which cannot be compared with the situation in the Paris slums. We plan to move them into new homes within three or four years. In the past three years, we have built 100,000 rooms.
    "Our current residential areas are evenly distributed throughout the city. Warsaw now covers an area four times larger than before the war. In the past, 700,000 people lived in the city center, with an average of 3,500 people per hectare. Now, the city center has 260,000 people, with only 600 to 700 people per hectare. When we restored and rebuilt Warsaw, we widened the streets, created street gardens and squares, and greened the city, planting tens of thousands of linden and maple trees along the roads."
    The Recent Situation of "Warsaw Street"
    People who have seen the Polish film "Warsaw Street" probably still remember the scene of the German fascist bandits destroying the street, with fires raging everywhere, houses collapsing, and turning into piles of rubble. We asked the Chief Architect, what has this street become recently?
    He said: "The story of the film 'Warsaw Street' did not happen on one street. The area where it happened includes most of the current Branov residential area. After the German fascists seized Warsaw, they confined all the Jews here, preparing to eliminate them. In April 1943, the Jews in the restricted area launched an uprising. The uprising was suppressed, and the Germans completely destroyed this area of about two square kilometers. This is the area of Warsaw that suffered the most damage. The film 'Warsaw Street' is based on this true story." Chiparovsky took out a photo of the street that was destroyed at that time, pointing to piles of broken bricks and rubble in the photo and said, "Only rubble like garbage was left in this area." He continued, "Now we have restored it according to the new urban plan. This is the now famous Branov residential area. New streets and squares have been built here. Warsaw's main north-south transportation line passes through this area. We have built buildings from two to six stories high here, with balconies and modern equipment. But so far, there are still many empty spaces in the area where the story of the film 'Warsaw Street' took place that have not been built. Starting next year, houses will be built on these empty spaces."
    Four Thousand Construction Sites
    Talking about the future construction of the city, the Chief Architect became even more excited. He pointed to the Warsaw construction map hanging on the wall of his office and said: "There are four thousand construction sites of various sizes in Warsaw, of which ninety-four are larger. The Warsaw Steel Plant is the largest of these construction sites. The factory covers an area of 145 hectares, plus a worker's village with 19,000 houses. In addition, construction workers are building the fifth bridge across the Vistula River. This bridge has two layers, the upper layer for cars and the lower layer for trams, which will connect the east and west parts of the city more closely.
    "In another twenty years, Warsaw's population may exceed two million, and housing construction is a serious problem. This year, we will continue to expand more than 20,000 houses. The principle of construction is simple, more, good, and economical. In the past, Warsaw's buildings had high costs, many decorations, and small usable areas. In order to save land, we will build several sixteen to eighteen-story high-rise buildings in the city center.
    "Soon, Warsaw will add a beautiful building – the Hero Monument, to commemorate the Polish heroes in the Second World War. We have received two hundred design drawings, including five or six designs sent by Chinese designers."
    After the Chief Architect finished talking, he invited us to visit the city another day and tour this Warsaw, which was rebuilt from the ruins of war and is becoming more and more beautiful every day.

    华沙建设得更美丽了
    ——访华沙市总建筑师戚帕罗夫斯基
    本报记者　李克
    一天清晨，在靠近维斯杜拉河河岸的一座小楼上，我们访问了华沙市总建筑师戚帕罗夫斯基同志，请他谈谈华沙建设情况。他怀着愉快兴奋的心情，向我们滔滔不绝地介绍了他的心爱的事业。
    六个工业区
    戚帕罗夫斯基同志首先说：“华沙今天是个生产的城市。第二次世界大战以后，我们在这里建设了六个工业区，像泽兰工业区完全是在荒野上建立起来的。这些工业区还在不断地扩大，它们拥有许多著名工厂，如泽兰汽车厂、摩托车工厂、无线电收音机厂和车床厂正在为国家提供头等质量的产品。另外，我们正在华沙北区新建一座炼钢厂，到1961年，这个工厂就可以每年为国家生产三十万吨钢。一座可容一万四千人的工人新村也在工厂附近兴建中，这是给未来的炼钢工人住的。
    “战前的华沙虽然也有工业，但基本上是个充满官僚主义行政机构的消费性质的城市。而今天的华沙是个生产的城市，它的工业产量比战前扩大了四倍。城市居民的阶级成份也有很大的改变，华沙现有的一百一十万居民中，有过半数即将近六十万是工人和职员，其中产业工人和建筑工人有二十六万。华沙的建设就是为生产、为这些劳动者服务的。”
    二十八个住宅区
    戚帕罗夫斯基同志接着谈到华沙的住宅建设，他说：“华沙现在有住房五十三万六千间，除了十六万个房间是在被破坏的旧房的基础上恢复的以外，其它全都是新建的。我们把拥有五千以上的居民，并且附有商店、学校、医院的建筑群称作一座住宅区，这样的住宅区华沙有二十八个。其中不少的住宅区有四万以上的人口，像一座真正的小城。华沙有名的住宅区布兰诺夫，新斯瓦特，马考托夫，居民都住在环境清幽、舒适方便的住宅里。住房都有现代化设备，85％的住房有暖气设备。战前一个资本家可以占用许多个房间，而工人之家要四五个人挤在一个小房间里，现在早已改变了这种情况，全市大体平均每两个人占用一间房。
    “目前华沙仍然有七万五千人的居住条件不好，”说到这里，戚帕罗夫斯基同志补充说，“巴黎有五十万人住在贫民窟。不过，我说华沙有的人居住条件不好，是指他们住的拥挤，房屋老旧，和巴黎贫民窟的情况不能同日而语。我们计划三、四年内把他们迁入新居。最近三年，我们要建成十万间房。
    “我们现在的住宅区在全市得到均匀的分布。现在华沙占地面积比战前大四倍，过去七十万人住在城市中心区，平均每一公顷面积上住着三千五百人，现在市中心区住着二十六万人，每公顷面积上只住着六百到七百人。我们在恢复和重建华沙时展宽了街道，辟出了街心花园和广场，绿化了城市，马路两旁栽种了几万株菩提和枫树。”
    “华沙一条街”近况
    看过波兰影片“华沙一条街”的人，大概还记得德国法西斯匪徒破坏这条街的情景，到处火光熊熊，房倾屋塌，变成一堆堆的瓦砾。我们问总建筑师，这条街最近变成了什么样子？
    他说：“影片‘华沙一条街’的故事不是发生在一条街上，它发生的区域包括现在布兰诺夫住宅区的大部分。德国法西斯在强占华沙后，把所有犹太人都禁闭在这里，准备加以消灭。1943年4月，禁闭区的犹太人发动了起义，起义被镇压了，德国人也彻底毁灭了这块约两平方公里的地区。这是华沙受破坏最严重的地区。影片‘华沙一条街’就是以这件真实的事情为背景的。”戚帕罗夫斯基找出一张当时被破坏的这条街的照片，指着照片上一堆堆的断瓦残砖说：“这块地区只剩下像垃圾似的瓦砾。”他接着说，“现在我们已按照新的城市规划把它恢复了起来，这就是现在有名的布兰诺夫住宅区，这里建成了新的街道和广场，华沙主要交通干道南北交通线就通过这个区，我们在这里建设了从两层到六层高的楼房，有阳台和现代化设备。但是到现在为止，影片‘华沙一条街’故事所发生的地区里还有不少空地没有建设起来，从明年起就要在这些空地上盖房。”
    四千个建筑工地
    谈到城市的未来建设，总建筑师越发眉飞色舞起来，他指着自己办公室墙上悬挂着的华沙建设图说：“华沙建筑工地大大小小有四千个，其中较大的有九十四个，华沙炼钢厂是这些工地当中最大的一个，工厂占地面积有一百四十五公顷，外加一座有一万九千间住房的工人村。此外，建筑工人正在建设跨过维斯杜拉河的第五座大桥，这座桥有两层，上层走汽车，下层走电车，这将把城市的东西两部更紧密地联系起来。
    “再过二十年，华沙的人口可能超过二百万，住宅建设是个严重问题。我们在今年要继续扩建二万多间住房，建筑的原则是朴素、多、好、省。过去华沙的建筑中曾出现过工本大、装饰多、使用面积小的建筑物。为了节约地皮，我们将在市中心区建几座十六——十八层的高层建筑物。
    “不久，华沙还要增添一座美丽的建筑物——英雄纪念碑，纪念波兰在第二次世界大战时的英雄，我们收到了二百个设计图样，其中还有五六个设计是中国设计师寄来的。”
    总建筑师谈完后，邀请我们改日一道去观光城市，游览一下这座在战争废墟中重建起来的、一天比一天更加美丽的华沙。
