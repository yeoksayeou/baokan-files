    High and Low Trunk Integrated Quick-Yield Mulberry Orchard

    The High and Low Trunk Integrated Quick-Yield Mulberry Orchard in Ninghai County, Zhejiang Province, is a new type of mulberry orchard designed based on advanced Soviet experience and with reference to local conditions. The main advantages of this type of mulberry orchard are: fast harvest and high yield. According to local experiments, the mulberry trees planted in the same year can yield two-thirds of the mulberry leaves in autumn, and the average yield per mu in the second year can reach more than 1,264 jin, which is two years earlier than ordinary medium-trunk mulberries.

    This type of mulberry orchard has 55 high-trunk mulberry trees and 723 low-trunk mulberry trees per mu, for a total of 778 trees. The low-trunk mulberry trees configured in this way are not suppressed by the crowns of the high-trunk mulberry trees for a long time, and can harvest a large number of mulberry leaves in a short period of time. When the low-trunk mulberry trees decline and reduce production over time, the high-trunk mulberry trees have formed a solid tree vigor and can still maintain a stable high yield.

    高低干综合速成桑园
    浙江省宁海县的高低干综合速成桑园，是根据苏联先进经验，参照当地具体情况设计的一种新型桑园。这种桑园的主要优点是：收获快、产量高。据当地试验，当年种植的桑树秋季就可以采三分之二的桑叶，第二年全年平均每亩可产叶一千二百六十四斤多，比一般普通中干桑提早收获二年。
    这种桑园，每亩配置高干桑五十五株，低干桑七百二十三株，共七百七十八株。这样配置的低干桑，有较长时期不受高干桑树冠的压制，并可在短期内收获大量的桑叶。当低干桑年久衰退减产的时候，高干桑已形成巩固的树势，仍可保持稳定的高额产量。
