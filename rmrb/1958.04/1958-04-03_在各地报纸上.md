In Newspapers Across the Country

　　Green Edges Adorn a Thousand Li of Yellow River

　　On April 1st, *Dazhong Daily* published inspiring news on its second page: Thirty thousand young people in Shandong created a miracle in two days and nights, adorning a thousand *li* of the Yellow River with green edges. In order to transform the banks of the Yellow River into green, tree-lined embankments, more than 300,000 young people in various counties along the river formed tens of millions of greening armies after the provincial youth afforestation mobilization rally. Braving the cold wind and dust, they planted more than 9.857 million trees along the 2,300 *li* of the Yellow River embankment. After greening the banks of the Yellow River, the youth took advantage of their victory to expand their achievements. More than 8,000 young people in Qihe County afforested 3,500 *mu* of sandy land in two days. Young people in Shouzhang County, together with the people of the entire county, fought hard for three days and greened the entire county.

　　In this extraordinary spring, the first new flowers appeared in the garden of local industry in Gansu. From early February to March 20, 1,015 newly built and expanded factories (fields) and mines across the province had been put into production, of which 903 were newly built. The characteristics of local industries in various places are: fast construction progress, many types of industries, and rapid commissioning. Many places have created good management methods. For example, the Huixian Winery has annexed vinegar making, glass, and firewood processing factories, forming a "brother-sister joint factory," which can not only make production perennial but also give full play to equipment potential and save costs. *Gansu Daily* published this report on the front page on March 30 and expounded in the editorial the principle that revolution must rely on the masses, and construction must also rely on the masses.

　　Beating Two Drums at Once

　　XuShui County, Hebei Province, seized the political and ideological work in the Great Leap Forward in production, and new atmospheres appeared on all fronts. *Hebei Daily* published on April 1 the report of the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on political and ideological work in Xushui. The Provincial Committee added a comment to the report, explaining that the experience of Xushui was mainly that the county committee grasped the two drums of production and thought, "When soldiers and horses move, politics must come first." This combination of politics and economy, production and rectification, made various tasks achieved a great leap forward situation. The newspaper also published an editorial commenting on this new situation of double leaps in production and rectification and the new content of ideological leaps.

　　Great Contribution of Handicraft Workers

　　The members of handicraft cooperatives in various counties in Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang, have made significant contributions to the reform of agricultural tools. *Zhejiang Daily* reported their achievements on the front page on March 30. In the past two months or so, handicraft workers in the entire region have created, imitated, and improved more than 150 kinds of agricultural tools. Among them are various waterwheels, hand-cranked (or foot-operated) river mud twisting machines, and wooden cranes, which are urgently needed by farmers to build water conservancy projects and accumulate fertilizer; hand-pushed wheelbarrows and bamboo rail soil sliding cars suitable for use in mountainous areas; boat-type mud transport vehicles suitable for use in areas with crisscrossing rivers; and machines for cutting mulberry leaves needed by silkworm farmers. These new and improved agricultural tools are very popular among farmers. The county committees of the Communist Party of China in various counties attach great importance to and support the creation of handicraft workers, and almost every county has established an agricultural tool reform group to lead.

　　Throw Away the Millennial Carrying Pole

　　New sprouts of tool reform are growing everywhere. "Throw Away the Millennial Carrying Pole, Achieve 'Vehicleization' in Seven Days" This is the headline news on the front page of *Fujian Daily* on March 26. The Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Ninghua County realized vehicleization, not only liberating the shoulders and increasing labor efficiency by three or four times, but also saving two or three million workdays for the entire cooperative in a year. Under the leadership of Wu Liangyi, the cooperative director who was originally a barrel maker, they put forward the slogan of "Towards Vehicleization." In just seven days, the entire cooperative built 162 vehicles, averaging one vehicle per household. The newspaper also published an editorial explaining that the realization of "vehicleization" and the elimination of the slogan of shoulder carrying will play a huge role in the great leap forward in production.

    在各地报纸上
    千里黄水镶上绿边
    1日，大众日报二版发表了鼓舞人心的消息：山东三十万青少年两昼夜创造奇迹，千里黄水镶上了绿边。为了把黄河两岸变成绿色的林荫长堤，沿河各县的三十多万青少年，在全省青少年绿化黄河誓师大会以后，组成了千万支绿化大军，冒着寒风、尘沙，在二千三百多华里的黄河大堤上，植树九百八十五万七千多棵。青少年们在绿化了黄河两岸以后，乘胜前进，扩大战果。齐河县八千多名青少年，两天内就绿化沙滩三千五百亩。寿张县青年同全县人民一起，奋战三天，绿化了全县。
    在这个不平凡的春天，在甘肃地方工业的园地上出现了第一批新花朵。从2月初到3月20 日，全省已有新建、扩建厂（场）矿一千零十五个投入生产，其中新建的就有九百零三个。各地兴办地方工业的特点是：建设进度快，行业种类多，投入生产迅速。不少地方创造了良好的经营方式。如徽县酒厂附设了制醋、玻璃、木柴加工厂，形成“兄弟姊妹联合厂”，既可以使生产常年化，又能充分发挥设备潜力，节约费用。3月30日甘肃日报一版头条发表了这个报道，并在社论中阐述了革命要依靠群众、建设也必须依靠群众的道理。
    两面锣鼓一齐响
    河北徐水县在生产大跃进中抓紧了政治思想工作，各条战线都出现了新气象。河北日报4月1日刊载了中共河北省委宣传部关于徐水政治思想工作的报告，省委在报告前加了批语，说明徐水经验主要是县委抓紧了生产、思想两面锣鼓一齐敲，“兵马要动，政治先行”这种政治与经济相结合，生产与整风相结合的作法，因而使各项工作出现了大跃进的局面。报纸并发表社论，评述这种生产整风双双跃进的新的局面和思想跃进的新内容。
    手工业者的大贡献
    浙江嘉兴专区各县手工业社的社员对改革农具作出了重大的贡献。3月30日浙江日报一版报道了他们的成就。两个多月来全区手工业者已创造、仿制和改良了一百五十多种农具。其中有农民兴修水利和积肥迫切需要的各种水车、手摇（或脚踏）捻河泥机、木制起重机，有适于在山区使用的手推独轮车、竹轨滑土车，有适于河道交错地区使用的船式运泥车，有桑农需要的切桑叶的机器。这些新式农具和改良农具，很受农民欢迎。各县中共县委十分重视和支持手工业者的创造，几乎每县都成立了农具改革小组进行领导。
  千年扁担一旦抛
    工具改革的新芽在各地普遍生长。千年扁担一旦抛，七天实现“车子化”这是3月26日福建日报一版头条新闻。宁化县前进农业社实现车子化，不但解放了肩膀，提高了劳动效率三、四倍，同时全社一年还能节省两三万个工。在桶匠出身的社长吴良义等带头下，提出“走向车子化”的口号，仅七天全社就造了一百六十二辆车子，平均每户有一辆。报纸并发表社论，说明实现“车子化”，消灭肩膀挑的口号，将对生产大跃进起着巨大的作用。
