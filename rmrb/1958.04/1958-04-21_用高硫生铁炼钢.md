Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 20th: The Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant successfully used high-sulfur pig iron to make steel in an alkaline converter on the 17th.

This new experience, which breaks with conventional steelmaking practices, greatly reduces the cost of steel (because high-sulfur pig iron is relatively cheap) and breaks through the limitations on the sulfur content of pig iron for steelmaking, opening up a new source of raw materials for alkaline converters. According to calculations by the No. 6 Plant, if high-sulfur pig iron is used for steelmaking continuously, the plant can save 4.18 million yuan a year.

Whether it is a converter or an open hearth furnace, the sulfur content of the raw material used for steelmaking—pig iron—has always been strictly required. This is because sulfur is a harmful element in steel. Scrap iron, such as discarded plowshares and ironware scattered among the people, as well as recycled iron made from scrap iron, although relatively inexpensive, could not be used in large quantities for steelmaking in the past due to their high sulfur content. Sun Lingen, the chief engineer of the plant and a Communist Party member who came from a working-class background, advocated for this experiment, and received strong support from the factory's Party organization, finally making a bold trial.

    用高硫生铁炼钢
    据新华社上海20日电　上海第六钢铁厂17日在碱性转炉上全部使用高硫生铁炼钢成功。
    这一打破了炼钢常规的新经验，既使钢的成本大大降低（因为高硫生铁比较便宜），又突破了炼钢生铁含硫量的限制，为碱性转炉开辟了新的原料来源。据六厂计算，如果一直用高硫生铁炼钢，这个厂一年就可以节约四百一十八万元。
    不管是转炉和平炉，历来对炼钢所用的原料——生铁的含硫量，要求都很严格。因为硫是钢中的害物。散存在民间的废犁头、铁器等杂铁，以及用杂铁做成的再生铁，虽然价格比较便宜，但因含硫过高，过去都不能大量用来炼钢。这个厂的炼钢工人出身的总工程师、共产党员孙林根，倡议进行这一试验，受到了工厂党组织的大力支持，终于大胆地作了试炼。
