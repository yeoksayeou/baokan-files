Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 18th: Some medical experts and famous doctors in Tianjin conducted a comprehensive physical examination and consultation for Liu Lianren at the Tianjin First Central Hospital on the 17th and 18th.

Liu Lianren's body suffered great damage during the fourteen years he was cruelly persecuted and tortured by Japanese militarists. The doctors carefully examined Liu Lianren's heart, facial features, and performed blood, urine, and stool tests. They also performed fluoroscopies of his lungs and bones. Famous doctors held a collective consultation for him. Liu Lianren told the doctors that he could not sleep well at night, waking up with a start every hour or so, and that his leg bones and heels ached, preventing him from walking much. After the doctors' examination and diagnosis, it was confirmed that Liu Lianren suffered from rheumatoid pain, heel spurs, proliferative spondylitis, chronic bronchitis, nervous insomnia, myocardial disease, pyorrhea alveolaris, and intestinal roundworm disease.

The consultation report, signed by a group of doctors, stated: "The above-mentioned diseases suffered by Liu Lianren are completely inseparable from the adverse environment and long-term mental stimulation he was subjected to." Liu Lianren expressed his gratitude for the doctors' care.

    天津医学专家会诊证明
    刘连仁身体受到很大损伤
    新华社天津18日电　天津市的一些医学专家和著名医师十七、十八两日在天津市立第一中心医院里为刘连仁全面检查了身体，并且为他会诊。
    被日本军国主义者残酷迫害、折磨的十四年中，刘连仁的身体受到了很大的损伤。医生们细心地为刘连仁检查了心脏、五官，化验了血液、大小便，透视了肺部和骨胳，著名医师们为他举行了集体会诊。刘连仁对医师们说，他夜里睡不好觉，每睡一个多小时就惊醒过来，而且腿骨和脚跟疼痛不能多走路。经过医师们的检查和诊断，证明刘连仁已患有风湿样疼痛、跟骨骨刺、增生性脊柱炎、慢性支气管炎、神经紧张性失眠、心肌疾患、齿槽溢脓和肠蛔虫病。
    在一批医师签字的会诊书上说：“刘连仁所患的以上疾病与所处的不良环境和长期的精神刺激完全不可分割。”刘连仁对医师们的关怀表示感谢。
