Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 27th April: The comprehensive experience created by the state-owned Qinghua Tool Factory and the state-owned Jianhua Machinery Factory in Heilongjiang Province, where cadres participate in production and workers directly participate in the daily management and reform of production teams, is currently being widely promoted in industrial enterprises throughout the province. The broad masses of workers and staff generally feel that this experience has solved some fundamental problems in the enterprise.

Since the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee convened an on-site meeting in late March to promote this experience, in less than a month, more than 80% of cadres in factories and mines in various regions have participated in physical labor in various forms. Among them, many workshop and office cadres have already achieved half-day labor and half-day work. In enterprises throughout the province, 80% to 90% of workers have directly participated in the daily management of production teams. Many unreasonable rules and regulations in many enterprises are being reformed in batches.

In promoting these three experiences, most enterprises closely combine them with the current rectification and "double anti" (anti-corruption, anti-waste) movement, and regard the promotion of this experience as the "big watermelon" to be embraced in the enterprise's rectification, fundamentally solving the problems existing in enterprise management. In promoting this experience, some enterprises in Harbin and other regions have adopted the mass line method of mobilizing the masses to conduct great airing of views, big contending, and big debates, thus laying a solid ideological foundation among the masses. In specific practices, they can combine with the actual situation of their own units, starting from reviewing past work, addressing the problems existing in the enterprise, prescribing the right medicine, and effectively solving the problems. Some units have further enriched the experience of the Qinghua and Jianhua factories with the good experiences created by the masses in their own enterprises.

After the implementation of this experience in various enterprises, it has been widely welcomed by the broad masses of workers and staff, and a new situation of lively and cheerful spirits has emerged, greatly advancing the production and management work of the enterprise. The bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leadership have been fundamentally changed, the relationship between the leadership and the masses has reached unprecedented unity, the comradeship-style cooperative relationship in socialist enterprise production has been further developed, and the sense of responsibility and production enthusiasm of the workers as masters of their own affairs has been greatly improved, making the production and management work of socialist enterprises have a more solid mass foundation. When the masses summarized this situation, they said, "In the past, one person carried thousands of pounds of burden, but now thousands of pounds of burden are carried by everyone."

    千斤重担众人挑
    黑龙江80％以上工人直接参加生产管理
    据新华社哈尔滨27日电　黑龙江省国营庆华工具厂和国营建华机械厂创造的干部参加生产、工人直接参加生产小组的日常管理工作和改革业务的全面经验，目前正在全省工业企业中广泛推行。广大职工群众普遍感到这个经验解决了企业中的一些根本性的问题。
    从3月下旬中共黑龙江省委召开现场会议推广这一经验以来，不到一个月各地厂矿已有80％以上的干部以各种形式参加了体力劳动，其中不少车间、科室干部已经作到半日劳动半日工作。全省各地企业已有80％到90％的工人直接参加了生产小组的日常管理工作。不少企业中不合理的规章制度正在一批批地被改革。
    大部分企业在推行这三项经验中，都紧密结合当前的整风、双反运动，把推行这项经验作为本企业整改中要抱的“大西瓜”，从根本上解决企业管理工作中存在的问题。哈尔滨市和其他地区一些企业在推广这项经验中，采取发动群众进行大鸣大放大辩论的群众路线方法，这样就在群众中打下牢固的思想基础。在具体作法上都能够结合本单位的实际情况，从检查过去工作入手，针对企业中存在的问题，对症下药，使问题得到有效的解决。有些单位并以本企业群众创造的好的经验，进一步充实了庆华、建华两厂的经验。
    各个企业在推行这项经验后，受到广大职工群众的普遍欢迎，出现了一种生动活泼心情舒畅的新局面，使企业生产和管理工作大大跃进了一步。领导上的官僚主义和主观主义从根本上有了转变，领导和群众之间的关系达到了空前的团结，使社会主义企业生产中同志式的互相合作关系得到进一步的发展，工人群众的主人翁责任感和生产积极性大大提高，使社会主义企业的生产和管理工作有了更加巩固的群众基础。群众总结这种情况时说“过去是千斤重担一人挑，现在是千斤重担众人挑”。
