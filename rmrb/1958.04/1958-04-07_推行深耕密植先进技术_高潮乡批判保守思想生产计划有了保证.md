Promoting Advanced Techniques of Deep Ploughing and Close Planting
Gaochao Township Criticizes Conservative Thinking, Ensuring Production Plans

(Reported by this newspaper) Hubei Province, Xinzhou County, Gaochao Township is carrying out rectification, criticizing conservative thinking, and implementing technical reform measures, vigorously promoting spring plowing and production. When Gaochao Township in Xinzhou County was taking concrete measures to actively prepare for spring plowing, some people held skeptical and resistant attitudes towards a series of advanced measures to guarantee rice production, such as deep plowing to a depth of seven inches, layered fertilization, close planting at four to six inches, and establishing new-style seedling beds. They used old conventions such as "plowing no more than three inches of soil" and "sparse planting of three *dan*, dense planting of six *luo*, the harvest will be the same" to oppose technical reforms. Some people, not lacking grain, also pestered cadres, arguing that supplies were insufficient. A small number of township and commune cadres also had varying degrees of complacency and slackness, only looking backward, not forward, only comparing themselves to the backward, not to the advanced. The leaders of Gaochao Township decided to mobilize the masses to remove these stumbling blocks in the great leap forward in production, organizing great debates in a guided manner, launching a mass rectification campaign to further improve the work style of cadres, raise the awareness of the masses, and overcome conservative thinking.

The rectification movement in Gaochao Township began in mid-February and has not yet ended. The on-site visits and exhibitions they organized during the rectification process played a significant role in opposing conservatism and boosting the enthusiasm of the masses. The township's plan for wheat production this year is an average yield of 400 *jin* per *mu*, a 2.5-fold increase compared to last year. Cadres and the masses boasted about this, believing they had "made a great leap forward" and "production had reached its peak." However, after visiting Liu Ji, Dadu, Jintai and other townships in the county to see their wheat production, they found that some of them had an average yield of 600 to 800 *jin* per *mu*, and some high-yield experimental plots reached 1,000 to 1,300 *jin*, and only then did they realize they were conservative, and that their wheat seedlings were not wide enough and the management was poor. As a result, they universally applied fertilizer once more. Every commune in the township established exhibition rooms, exhibiting the 1958 agricultural production plan, the money and materials invested in production by commune members, the deeds of model figures in production savings, the surplus grain of households falsely claiming a shortage of supplies, etc. The masses in the township took out cash and materials to invest a total of more than 40,000 yuan. Female commune member He Xiju visited the exhibition five times and invested a total of 256 yuan.

Through the rectification, conservative thinking among cadres and the masses was criticized. Now, the early rice fields throughout the township are generally plowed to a depth of six or seven inches, with some deep-plowed to eight inches. Last year, new-style seedling beds took a lot of effort and only accounted for 10%, but this year, not a single old-style seedling bed can be found. In the past, many people who complained about insufficient grain supplies are now voluntarily reporting that they have surplus grain. (Zhang Chengxin)

    推行深耕密植先进技术
    高潮乡批判保守思想生产计划有了保证
    本报讯　湖北省新洲县高潮乡开展整风，批判保守思想贯彻技术改革措施，有力地推动了春耕大生产。新洲县高潮乡正在采取具体措施积极进行春耕准备工作的时候，却有些人对实行保证水稻定产的深耕七寸，分层施肥，四、六寸密植，办新式秧田等一系列先进措施，抱着怀疑和抵触情绪。他们拿“犁无三寸土”、“稀三担，密六箩，打起谷来一样多”等陈规旧套来反对技术改革；有些人不缺粮食，也拉着干部吵供应不够，少数乡、社干部还有不同程度的麻痹松劲情绪，只往后看，不往前看，只比落后不比先进。高潮乡的领导决定发动群众挖掉这些生产大跃进中的绊脚石，有领导地组织大鸣大放大辩论，开展一次全民整风，进一步改进干部作风，提高群众觉悟，克服保守思想。
    高潮乡的整风运动是从2月中旬开始的，目前尚未结束。他们在整风中组织的现场参观，开展览会的方法对于反对保守，提高群众积极性作用很大。全乡今年小麦规划平均亩产四百斤，比去年翻了二倍半，干部和群众都以此炫耀，认为“大跃进了”，“生产到顶了”。可是去本县的刘集、大渡、金台等乡参观小麦以后，人家有的平均亩产六百至八百斤，有些高额丰产试验片高达一千至一千三百斤，才觉得自己保守了，才看到自己的麦苗宽幅条播不宽，管理不善。于是普遍增施了一次肥料。全乡社社办了展览室，展出有1958年的农业生产规划，社员生产投资的钱和实物，生产节约模范人物的事迹，假吵供应户的存粮等等，全乡群众拿出现金和实物投资共四万多元。女社员贺细菊看了五次展览会，共投资二百五十六元。
    通过整风，干部和群众中的保守思想受到了批判。现在，全乡的早稻田一般犁了六、七寸，有的深耕到八寸。新式秧田去年费了九牛二虎之力，只搞了10％，今年旧式秧田一块也找不到了。过去吵粮食供应不够的，现在许多人自报有余粮。　（张成信）
