Notes

    Even More Rampant
    The West German government, colluding with the United States, insisted on discussing the so-called German reunification issue at the summit conference, in order to obstruct and undermine the convening of the summit. However, according to a spokesman for the West German government, Adenauer has indicated in his talks with Macmillan that he does not intend to insist on this demand.
    Does this mean that Adenauer has abandoned his plan to obstruct and undermine the summit conference? Not at all. The spokesman for the West German government said that if the summit conference is to discuss specific issues such as European security or disengagement, the Bonn government will still insist that the so-called German reunification issue should be discussed at the same time.
    Promoting the resolution of European security issues is a major task of the summit conference, but the West German government openly threatens the summit conference, forbidding it to discuss such issues. This is obviously a more malicious way of undermining the summit conference. Therefore, Adenauer has not only not changed his attitude towards the summit conference, but on the contrary, has shown himself to be even more rampant.

    更加猖狂了
    西德政府曾与美国串通，坚持要在最高级会议上讨论所谓德国的统一问题，借以阻挠和破坏最高级会议的召开。可是，据西德政府的一个发言人说，阿登纳在与麦克米伦的会谈中已经表示，他不打算坚持这个主张了。
    这是不是说，阿登纳已经放弃了他的阻挠和破坏最高级会议的计划了呢？完全不是那回事。西德政府的发言人说，如果最高级会议要讨论欧洲安全或脱离接触等具体问题，波恩政府还是要坚持应当同时讨论所谓德国的统一问题。
    促进欧洲安全问题的解决，是最高级会议的一个主要任务，而西德政府却公然威胁最高级会议，不准它讨论这类问题。这显然是破坏最高级会议的一种更恶毒的手法。所以，阿登纳不但没有改变他对待最高级会议的态度，相反的是表现得更加猖狂了。
