Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 1st. Czechoslovak newspapers today published editorials welcoming the Soviet Union's decision to cease nuclear testing.

The "Red Right" newspaper's editorial said that the Soviet decision is a model initiative, which will undoubtedly have a powerful and positive impact on the further development of international relations.

The newspaper pointed out that if Western countries continue to conduct nuclear tests in disregard of the Soviet decision, they will openly prove their aggressive intentions. The Soviet decision will certainly encourage ordinary people to strengthen the international struggle against atomic weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 1st. The Polish "People's Tribune" today published a commentary pointing out that the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally stop nuclear weapons tests is of great significance for European and world security. The Soviet decision is the first practical measure in the world to open the way for the elimination of nuclear weapons, and it is in line with the wishes of people all over the world and the needs of the times.

The commentary also pointed out that the Soviet Union proposed a permanent cessation of nuclear testing. This requires the unanimous guarantee of all countries that produce nuclear weapons.

The Japanese Communist Party Issued a Statement: The Soviet Decision Brings Light to the Japanese People

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. Tokyo News: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party today issued a statement welcoming and supporting the Soviet Union's decision to stop atomic and hydrogen weapon tests.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet Union's first announcement of the cessation of nuclear weapons tests demonstrates the sincere desire of the Soviet people and government to strive for peace. The Soviet decision brings light to the Japanese people who have directly suffered from the atomic bomb disaster, and brings hope for peace to the people all over the world.

The statement strongly demanded that the United States and Britain immediately take the same measures as the Soviet Union and stop all nuclear weapons tests, including the hydrogen bomb test scheduled to be held on Eniwetok Island in the Pacific Ocean in April.

Former Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson Said that the West Should Follow the Soviet Example

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. Ottawa News: Former Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson said on March 31st, when talking about the Soviet Union's decision to independently stop testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, that the Western powers that possess atomic weapons should follow the Soviet example.

Pearson expressed regret that the West "once again gave the initiative to the Soviet Union." He believes that the West must at least conclude a temporary agreement with the Soviet Union on this basis, rather than allowing the Soviet Union to continue to "maintain the initiative."

British Labour Party Members of Parliament Said that If the United States and Britain Do Not Do the Same, They Will Be Condemned by the World

Xinhua News Agency, London, April 1st. The Soviet Union's statement on the cessation of nuclear testing immediately aroused enthusiastic reactions in Britain.

Many Labour MPs and trade union leaders said they thanked the Soviet Union for this new proposal. Fenner Brockway said: "This is very good news. If Britain and the United States refuse to follow this example, they will be condemned by world moral opinion." Victor Yates said that "the West should heartily welcome" this decision, and he believes that this "will be a major step towards true peace." Harold Davies said: "All sincere and good people, regardless of their political views, will feel relieved after reading this statement."

Labour MP Lewis said that the Soviet Union's decision to stop testing nuclear weapons shattered all the excuses of Western countries in stopping testing atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs.

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. London News: British Home Secretary Butler said in a televised broadcast on the evening of March 31st that the British government is "willing to study" the Soviet government's statement on the cessation of nuclear testing.

A reporter asked Butler whether the attitude of Britain and the United States towards the nuclear test issue would be different from the past after the Soviet government's statement was issued. In answering this question, Butler reiterated the consistent position of Western countries that this issue must be linked to the entire disarmament issue. He also reiterated that Britain does not intend to give up nuclear weapons, because this would "weaken its strength and weaken its influence."

Ollenhauer Said that Western Countries Should Conduct Serious Negotiations with the Soviet Union

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. Bonn News: The Soviet Union's decision to stop nuclear weapons testing has been widely valued in West Germany. West German government spokesman Eckardt said at a press conference on March 31st when talking about the Soviet decision, that on the one hand, he tried his best to belittle its significance, attempting to portray it as "pure propaganda activity"; but on the other hand, he had to admit that this decision would help the holding of the summit meeting and "improve the working atmosphere of the meeting."

Ollenhauer, chairman of the largest opposition party in West Germany, the Social Democratic Party, believes that the Soviet decision "will ease international tensions." He said in a statement issued on the same day that Western countries should now conduct serious and purposeful negotiations with the Soviet Union in order to reach an agreement on the issue of abandoning nuclear weapons explosions.

The American "Washington Post" Said that the United States' Hard-line Policy Has Put Itself in an Embarrassing Situation

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. New York News: American newspapers and radio stations attach great importance to the Soviet Union's statement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Newspapers have published news about the Soviet statement in prominent positions.

The "New York Post" wrote in an editorial when pointing out that the United States is prepared to continue nuclear testing: "The international discussion on the nuclear test issue is an unfortunate history for the United States. For a long time, the Russians have suggested stopping nuclear tests. And our government has categorically answered: 'No.' ... Dulles should know how huge a political price we have paid for this nuclear frenzy."

The "Washington Post" editorial said: The Soviet statement "has placed the United States in an extremely embarrassing position in the face of world opinion." It pointed out that this is the result of the US authorities' implementation of a "hard-line" policy.
