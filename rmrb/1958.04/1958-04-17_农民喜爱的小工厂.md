Small in Scale, Big in Impact
The Zhangjiawan Ironware Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing is a small factory beloved by the farmers. A 7.5 horsepower portable boiler powers two old six-foot belt lathes, an old-fashioned drilling machine, a grinding wheel, a pig iron furnace producing one ton of iron per day, and five drying ovens – this is the factory's entire inventory. With these meager assets, the workers undertake the production, repair, and maintenance of small farm tools and agricultural water conservancy machinery for fifty to sixty villages within a radius of thirty li. In the past two years, it has manufactured nearly 80,000 pieces of various small farm tools such as ploughshares, ice picks, and iron shovels, as well as more than 1,200 hand-operated waterwheels, powerfully supporting agricultural production.

This factory was originally just a bicycle repair group composed of three people. Farmers here had to travel more than ten li to Tongzhou to get a hoe or repair a pickaxe, which was very inconvenient. In 1955, the county party committee decided to shift this group to serve agriculture. Several blacksmiths were transferred from other towns, and several drying ovens were built, thus a small iron factory serving agriculture was born. Initially, it repaired farm tools for farmers, welded tin kettles, and made some simple household utensils. With the popularization of new-style farm tools and the development of small-scale water conservancy projects, the tasks it undertook could no longer be handled by a few drying ovens. Therefore, it was decided to further expand the factory.

Salvaging and Recycling to Expand Production
In order to expand production, they bought several almost obsolete belt lathes and a pig iron furnace from the city. They used these old and worn-out machines to establish a simple mechanical processing workshop and a foundry workshop. In this way, the factory developed into a small-scale agricultural machinery repair and parts and farm tool manufacturing plant. The number of employees also increased from three to fifty-five. "Small though it may be, it has all the vital organs." In addition to blacksmiths, the factory also had foundry workers, lathe operators, fitters, gas welders... The growth of these skilled workers was slowly cultivated by Zhou Shiqing, an old technician who had been laid off from a private iron factory a few years ago.

Convenient, Flexible, and Popular with Farmers
Serving agriculture is not only reflected in the factory's production content but also in its operating characteristics. In daily production, they carry out batch production of farm tools and repair of agricultural machinery in the factory. At the same time, they regularly send out teams with simple materials and tools to tour various townships and cooperatives, repairing and remanufacturing various farm tools for farmers on the spot. If there is a minor breakdown of agricultural machinery, the townships and cooperatives only need to make a phone call or send a message, and they will immediately send someone to repair it, achieving "available upon call, and repaired immediately upon arrival." The factory is also a technical guidance station for agricultural cooperatives, and they conscientiously provide assistance and guidance to various cooperatives in the installation, use, and maintenance of agricultural machinery. The factory's working hours shift with the needs of agricultural production, and during the busy farming season, the employees work tirelessly day and night.

This factory has already taken root in the countryside and is sincerely loved by the farmers. The farmers regard the workers as their own people, and wherever the workers go, the farmers give them a warm reception. During the busy farming season, farmers often carry damaged farm tools and knock on the door in the middle of the night to have them repaired. Once, when the workers lit a small oil lamp and repaired the farm tools overnight, an old farmer said with emotion: "Workers and peasants are brothers, I won't thank you. Only with you can we truly see the benefits of industrialization for farmers!" Indeed, simple machinery and equipment coupled with a small number of technical personnel can play a huge role in agricultural production and bring many benefits to farmers. The Zhangjiawan Ironware Production Cooperative has set a good example for us.

    农民喜爱的小工厂
    家当虽少　作用很大
    北京郊区张家湾铁业生产合作社，是一个受农民爱戴的小工厂。一个七点五马力的锅驼机带动着两台破旧的六尺皮带车床，一台老式钻床，一台砂轮磨床，一个日产一吨铁水的熔铁炉，五盘烘炉，这就是这个厂的全部家当。靠这点点家当，工人们承担了方圆三十里内、五六十个村子小农具的生产、修理和农田水利机械的修配任务。两年来，它为农民制造了犁头、冰镐、铁锨等各式小农具近八万件，手摇式水车一千二百多台，有力地支援了农业生产。
    这个厂原来只是一个由三个人组成的自行车修理组。这里的农民添个锄头，修把洋镐，总要跑上十来里到通州去，非常不便。1955年县委才决定把这个小组转向为农业服务。从别的镇上调来了几个黑白铁匠，打起来了几盘烘炉，这样，一个为农业服务的小铁工厂就诞生了。起初，它给农民修理些农具，焊焊洋铁壶，还做点很简单的生活用具。随着新式农具的推广，小型水利事业的发展，它所承担的任务，就不再是几盘烘炉所能应付得了的了。于是决定把厂子进一步扩大。
    拾旧捡破　扩大生产
    为了扩大生产，他们到城里买来几台快老到掉牙的皮带车床和一个熔铁炉。他们就利用这点破旧的老式机器建立起简陋的机械加工车间和翻砂车间。这样，这个厂就发展成为一个小具规模的农业机械修配和农具制造工厂。职工也由三人增加到五十五人。“麻雀虽小，肝胆俱全”。这个厂除了黑白铁匠以外，还有翻砂工、车工、钳工、气焊工……这些技术工人的成长，是依靠了一个几年前被私营铁工厂解雇了的老技工周士清慢慢地培养出来的。
    方便、灵活、农民喜欢
    为农业服务，这不仅表现在这个厂的生产内容上，而且也表现在它的经营特点上。在日常生产中，他们一方面在厂里进行农具的整批生产和农业机械的修理；另一方面，经常派出小组，带着简单的材料、工具，巡回各乡各社，就地给农民修理和再制各种农具。遇到农业机械发生小故障，各乡、社只要打个电话，捎个口信，他们就马上派人去修理，做到“随叫随到，随到随修”。这个厂还是农业社的技术指导站，在农业机械的安装、使用和保护方面，他们都认真负责地给各社以帮助和指导。厂的劳动时间随着农业生产的需要而转移，在农忙时节，职工就不辞劳苦昼夜不停地赶工。
    这个厂在农村中已经扎下了根，受到农民的衷心爱戴。农民把工人看成自己人，工人走到哪里，哪里的农民都给以热情的招待。农忙的时候，农民常常扛着损坏了的农具，半夜三更敲门来修。一次，当工人们点起小油灯，连夜把农具修好的时候，一位老农民感动地说：“工农是弟兄，我不谢你们了。有了你们，才真看到工业化对庄稼人的好处啦！”的确，简陋的机器装备加上少数的技术力量，就可以对农业生产发挥巨大的作用，给农民带来很多好处。张家湾铁业生产合作社为我们作出了一个良好的榜样。
