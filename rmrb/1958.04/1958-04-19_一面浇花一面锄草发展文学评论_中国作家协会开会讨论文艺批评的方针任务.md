Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The China Writers Association convened a conference on literary criticism work in Beijing from April 8th to 10th. Participants included heads of major literary and art journals and critics from the capital, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. The meeting was presided over by Shao Quanlin, Vice-Chairman of the Writers Association. Lin Mohan, Yuan Shuipai, Guo Xiaochuan, Ye Yiqun, Fang Ji, Ge Luo, Zhang Guangnian, Zhang Geng, Chen Huangmei and others spoke. On the afternoon of the 9th, an enlarged meeting was held, where Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech, explaining the guiding principles and tasks of literary and art criticism work and the policy of criticism.

The meeting, based on the current situation of the Great Leap Forward and the state of literary criticism work, discussed the guiding principles and methods of literary criticism, the expansion of the literary criticism force, and the 1958 review plan of major literary and art journals.

The meeting affirmed the significant achievements of literary criticism work in the ideological struggle of literature and art since the founding of the People's Republic of China. From the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," the criticism of the ideologies of Hu Shi and Hu Feng, to the anti-rightist struggle in literary and art circles and the criticism of revisionism since last year, literary criticism workers have made great efforts to defend the Marxist literary direction and criticize the reactionary literary and art ideology of the bourgeoisie. In particular, the victory of the anti-rightist struggle in literary and art circles has cleared the way for the development of socialist literature and prepared the conditions for the current Great Leap Forward in literary work. Since last year, many excellent works have appeared in literature, and these works have been welcomed by the masses and praised and discussed by critics. The work of reviewing works has also become more active than before. At the same time, the meeting pointed out that the current review work cannot fully adapt to the development of creation and meet the needs of the masses. The atmosphere of free debate has not yet been well developed. In theoretical research and literary teaching, there is still a strong tendency to value the past over the present and to be divorced from reality. A literary and art theory force armed with Marxism has not yet been well established. These problems must be solved in the Great Leap Forward.

The meeting unanimously agreed that the fundamental task of the current review work should be to promote the rapid and healthy development of socialist literature and art, and to continue to criticize various anti-socialist literary and artistic ideological tendencies. To this end, it is necessary to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." The meeting put forward the following six points as the key points of the current literary review work: (1) Water flowers on the one hand and weed on the other, weeding to protect the flowers. Watering flowers also requires trimming branches and leaves, and weeding must be thorough; (2) Revisionism must be thoroughly criticized, and dogmatism must also be overcome. There must be both destruction and construction; there is no construction without destruction, and destruction is also for construction; (3) Be clear-cut, honest in attitude, launch free debate, and promote originality; (4) Critics should listen to, study, and centrally express the opinions of the masses, and at the same time guide the criticism of the masses; (5) Overcome the tendency to value the past over the present, closely connect with reality, and correctly treat heritage; (6) Expand the team, tap potential, cultivate new forces, and strive to be both red and expert.

The meeting held that literary and art journals in various places should vigorously promote discussions on various opinions on works and literary and art theory issues, and encourage the courage to express opinions and dare to criticize boldly. In this discussion, special attention should be paid to the cultivation of new forces, because young reviewers are often more daring to express original ideas; secondly, the discussion of experts and the discussion of the masses should be combined, so that the discussion will be more lively. The meeting held that literary review work should clearly focus on reviewing modern works, and reviewers should use full enthusiasm to affirm new socialist literary works. Literary review should put political standards first, and also have artistic analysis. It should encourage Chinese departments in various universities to attach importance to and improve the teaching of modern literature, and encourage researchers of classical literature to pay attention to the study of modern works and writers, and oppose the tendency to despise modern works and worship ancient works uncritically. Literary research institutions, universities, and literary journals should plan to improve and strengthen the research work on Marxist literary theory. The meeting suggested that the Writers Association and relevant literary research institutions should begin to compile materials on literary work over the past 30 years and summarize the experience since the New Literature Movement. Regarding the style and form of review articles, everyone advocated diversity, and review articles should strive to be accurate, clear, and vivid.

Finally, regarding the expansion of the review team, the meeting agreed with the suggestions in the thirty-two articles of the Secretariat of the Writers Association on the Great Leap Forward in literary work that each province and city should have its own theoretical criticism team, and Beijing and Shanghai should have a basic theoretical criticism team. The meeting proposed to strive to establish a theoretical criticism team of more than 1,000 people across the country, including a basic team of 300 people with a higher level. The meeting suggested that each journal can appropriately adopt the system of commentators or correspondents, and in some regions or universities, review groups can be established, and it is recommended that the Literary and Art News and each journal compile and print information on the work of review for reviewers to refer to.

    一面浇花一面锄草发展文学评论
    中国作家协会开会讨论文艺批评的方针任务
    新华社18日讯　中国作家协会于4月8日至10日在北京召开了文学评论工作会议。参加会议的有首都、上海、天津等地主要文艺刊物的负责人和评论家。会议由作家协会副主席邵荃麟主持。林默涵、袁水拍、郭小川、叶以群、方纪、葛洛、张光年、张庚、陈荒煤等做了发言。9日下午召开扩大会议，中共中央宣传部副部长周扬讲了话，就文艺批评工作的方针任务和批评政策作了说明。
    会议根据当前大跃进的形势和文学评论工作上的情况，讨论了文学评论的方针方法问题，扩大文学评论队伍问题和各主要文艺刊物1958年度的评论规划。
    会议肯定了建国以来文学评论工作在文艺思想斗争中的重大成绩。从电影“武训传”批判、胡适、胡风思想批判一直到去年以来文艺界反右派斗争和对修正主义的批判中，文学评论工作者都作了很大的努力，捍卫了马克思主义的文学方向，批判了资产阶级的反动文艺思想，特别是文艺界反右派斗争的胜利，为社会主义文学的发展扫清了道路，为当前文学工作的大跃进准备了条件。去年以来，文学方面出现了许多优秀的作品，这些作品受到群众的欢迎和评论家的赞扬、讨论，作品评论工作也较前活跃。会议同时指出，目前评论工作还不能完全适应创作发展的状况和满足群众的要求。自由论辩空气还没有很好展开。在理论研究和文艺教学工作中，还存在着浓重的厚古薄今，脱离实际的倾向，以马克思主义为武装的文艺理论队伍，还没有很好的建立起来。这些问题，必须在大跃进中予以解决。
    会议一致认为当前评论工作的根本任务应该是促进社会主义的文艺迅速和健康发展；对各种反社会主义的文艺思想倾向继续进行批判。为此，必须贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，会议提出下列六条，作为当前文学评论工作的要点：（1）一面浇花，一面锄草，锄草为了护花。浇花还要修理枝叶，锄草必须锄透；（2）修正主义必须彻底批判，教条主义也必须克服，有破有立，不破不立，破也是为了立；（3）旗帜鲜明，态度老实，展开自由论辩，发扬独创精神；（4）评论家要听取、研究和集中地表达群众的意见，同时又对群众的批评起指导作用；（5）克服厚古薄今的倾向，密切联系实际，正确对待遗产；（6）扩大队伍，发掘潜力，培养新生力量，力求红透专深。
    会议认为，各地文艺刊物应该大力提倡对于作品和文艺理论问题各种不同意见的讨论，鼓励敢于发表意见、敢于大胆批评的勇气。在这种讨论中，尤其应注意新生力量的培养，因为青年评论工作者，往往更敢于发表创见；其次应该使专家的讨论和群众的讨论结合起来，这样讨论就会更活泼。会议认为文学评论工作上应明确以评论现代作品为主，评论工作者应当用满腔热情来肯定新的社会主义的文学作品。文学评论应当把政治标准列为第一位，同时也要有艺术的分析。应该鼓励各高等学校中文系重视和改进现代文学的教学，鼓励古典文学研究者同时注意研究现代作品和作家，反对菲薄现代作品和无批判地崇拜古代作品的倾向。文学研究机构、高等学校、文学刊物对于马克思主义文学理论研究工作，要有计划地改进和加强。会议建议作协及有关文学研究机构，应着手编辑三十多年来文学工作的资料，总结新文学运动以来的经验。对于评论文章的风格、形式大家都主张多种多样，评论文章应力求准确、鲜明、生动。
    最后，关于扩大评论队伍问题，会议同意作协书记处提出的文学工作大跃进三十二条中的建议，各省市要有自己的理论批评队伍，北京、上海应有基本的理论批评队伍。会议提出争取在全国建立一千人以上的理论批评队伍，其中包括三百人的具有较高水平的基本队伍。会议建议各刊物可以适当采用评论员或通讯员的制度，在某些地区或高等学校可以建立评论小组，并建议由文艺报和各刊物编印关于评论工作的情况资料，供给评论工作者参考。
