Xinhua News Agency report: Antara News Agency reported that in Central Sumatra, nearly 300 student soldiers left their training camp and openly revolted against the rebel regime.

These student soldiers revolted following Major Nur Mattias, commander of the 140th Battalion under Husein's control, who left the rebel ranks in Bukittinggi with several companies a few days ago.

Government troops in the Riau region recently seized another batch of weapons and ammunition left behind by fleeing rebels in Kuntu Village. The weapons included a machine gun, ten boxes of rocket shells, and four boxes of launcher shells. In addition, two jeeps and two trucks were found.

In the Taruk region, the army discovered a rebel food depot filled with rice and sugar.

In North Sumatra, a captured rebel told army interrogators that the Naimgolang's troops have now become a disorganized force, and many of the students and young people among them have fled.

The prisoner revealed how these young people were deceived and forced to join the rebels. He said that if a student or young person refused to take up arms and fight, they would be beaten to death with rifle butts.

In other news, Lieutenant Colonel Yono Sewoyo, Chief of Staff of the Eastern Indonesian Military District, received a report from Palu on the 3rd, stating that a rebel company led by Captain Nelwan had surrendered to government forces north of Langara in Central Sulawesi.

Yono Sewoyo said that the news broadcast by Manado Radio that the rebels had reoccupied Palu was untrue.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：安塔拉通讯社报道，在中苏门答腊，近三百名学生兵离开了他们的训练营，公开起义反对叛军政权。
    这些学生兵是继努尔·马提亚斯少校之后起义的，努尔·马提亚斯少校是侯赛尼控制下的第一四○营营长，在几天前同好几连人离开武吉丁宜的叛军队伍。
    廖内地区的政府军最近又在昆图村搜获逃跑的叛军留下来的一批武器和弹药。这些武器包括一挺机枪、十箱火箭炮弹和四箱发射器炮弹。此外，还发现两辆吉普车和两辆卡车。
    在塔鲁克地区，陆军发现堆满大米和食糖的一个叛军的粮食仓库。
    在北苏门答腊，被俘的一名叛军对陆军的审讯员说，奈恩戈兰的部队，目前已成为一支涣散的队伍，他们当中的许多学生和青年都已经逃跑。
    这个俘虏透露了这些青年被欺骗和强迫参加叛军的情形。他说，如果一个学生或者青年拒绝拿起武器作战的话，就要被别人用枪托打死。
    另据东印度尼西亚军区参谋长约诺塞沃约中校3日从巴路接到报告说，一连由内尔万上尉率领的叛军已经在中苏拉威西的浪加拉的北面向政府军投诚。
    约诺塞沃约说，万鸦老电台所播发的叛军重新占领巴路的消息，是不确实的。（附图片）
