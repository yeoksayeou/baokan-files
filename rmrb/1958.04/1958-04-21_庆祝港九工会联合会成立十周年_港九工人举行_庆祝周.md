Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 20th. Hong Kong workers are holding a "Celebration Week" starting today to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, a shining banner of worker unity.

The 11th Representative Congress of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions also took place this morning. Xu Zhencai, Chairman of the Presidium of the Congress, said in his speech that over the past decade, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions has achieved brilliant successes in four important aspects: promoting worker unity, developing worker welfare, safeguarding workers' occupational lives, and defending workers' legitimate rights and interests. The Federation of Trade Unions has also grown from the initial twenty-two member unions and over twenty thousand members to today's fifty-seven member unions and one hundred and thirty thousand members. At the same time, the Federation of Trade Unions has also conducted friendly exchanges with trade unions in various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and its unity with compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong has become closer than ever before. In the past decade, the welfare of workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon has also greatly developed. Labor Children's Schools and Labor Night Schools, which have been strongly supported by the Federation of Trade Unions, have increased from one ten years ago to ten today. The number of workers' children and adult worker students in these schools has increased from eighty-three to more than five thousand. The initial Workers' Clinic has only been one but there are now seven relatively complete workers' medical institutions.

Chen Yaocai, President of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, reported in detail on the work of the Federation of Trade Unions over the past decade. Li Sheng, Director, in his closing remarks at the representative congress, put forward the direction of efforts for trade unions in various industries in the future, based on the speeches of representatives of trade unions in various industries.

More than four hundred representatives of trade unions from various industries attended the conference today. They repeatedly applauded enthusiastically when they heard about the major developments in the Hong Kong workers' cause over the past decade.

Dozens of trade unions in various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon will hold celebrations and other various celebration activities during the "Celebration Week." A conference of all Hong Kong and Kowloon workers to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Federation of Trade Unions will be held on the 27th.
