Xinhua News Agency Report: Damascus newspapers report that armed clashes occurred between government troops and local residents in the Dahrayr al-Baydar district of the Khannisa Mountain, 40 kilometers southeast of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, for two consecutive days on the 10th and 11th. It is reported that the army used mortars and machine guns in the clashes.

According to "Al-Ra'i," the clashes began when some supporters of Kamal Jumblatt, leader of the Lebanese opposition party, the Socialist Progressive Party, refused to hand over their weapons to the police.

Observers believe that the main reason for the armed clashes is the repressive measures taken by the current President Chamoun against the opposition, intending to achieve his re-election by amending the constitution. To this end, Chamoun has distributed weapons to his supporters and the fascists of the National Social Party.

Newspapers reported that some prominent Muslim leaders, including former Prime Ministers Yafi and Saeb Salam, as well as many opposition members of parliament, jointly announced on the evening of the 10th that they firmly opposed Chamoun's re-election as president and would fight by all means. Henri Pharoun, leader of the "Third Force" party, which often maintains neutrality between the government and the opposition, also issued a statement on the 12th, condemning Lebanese President Chamoun's attempt to amend the constitution to allow himself to be re-elected, and accusing Chamoun of distributing weapons to his supporters.

    黎巴嫩国内政争尖锐化
    政府向反对派进行武装镇压
    据新华社讯　大马士革报纸的消息说，10日和11日连续两天在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特东南四十公里卡尼萨山的达赫赖勒贝达尔区，发生了政府军队和当地居民之间的武装冲突。据报道，军队在冲突中使用了迫击炮和机关枪。
    据“舆论报”报道，冲突是由于黎巴嫩反对党、社会主义进步党领袖卡迈勒·琼布拉特的一些支持者拒绝把他们的枪支交给警察而开始发生的。
    观察家们认为，发生武装冲突的主要原因是现任总统夏蒙对反对派采取了镇压措施，打算通过修改宪法来达到他重新当选总统的目的。为此，夏蒙已经把枪支分发给他的支持者和国家社会党的法西斯分子。
    报纸报道，包括前总理雅非和塞布·萨拉姆在内的一些著名穆斯林领袖以及许多反对党议员在10日晚上联名宣布，他们坚决反对夏蒙连任总统，并将用一切办法进行斗争。经常在政府和反对党之间保持中立的政党“第三力量”的领袖亨利·法龙也在12日发表声明，谴责黎巴嫩总统夏蒙企图修改宪法使自己连任，并且指责夏蒙把武器发给支持他的人。
