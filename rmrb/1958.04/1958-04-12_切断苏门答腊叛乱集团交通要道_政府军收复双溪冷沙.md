Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 11th: The "Indonesia Torch" newspaper reported today that Indonesian government troops recaptured Sungai Langsat, an important transportation center about 90 kilometers from Padang, the nest of the Hussein rebel group, on April 9th.

Sungai Langsat is located east of Padang and is a crucial highway hub connecting West Sumatra, the main area occupied by the rebel group, to South Sumatra. According to reports, the oil used by the rebel group was transported from here, and the rebel group's "messengers" also frequently passed through here to other places. After the government troops recaptured Sungai Langsat, it became possible to cut off the rebel group's escape routes to Jambi and South Sumatra.

Jakarta newspapers all reported today that government troops will soon launch the final stage of attacks on Bukit Tinggi and Padang, the nests of the Hussein rebel group.

The Hussein rebel group has become even more panicked due to the fierce attacks from government troops from the outside, as well as the opposition from local people and dissatisfied troops from within. The rebel group is now stepping up its efforts to force students to enlist in the army, piecing together new troops for a final struggle.

    切断苏门答腊叛乱集团交通要道
    政府军收复双溪冷沙
    新华社雅加达11日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天报道，印度尼西亚政府军在4月9日收复了离开侯赛尼叛乱集团巢穴巴东约九十公里的重要交通中心双溪冷沙。
    双溪冷沙在巴东的东面，为叛乱集团窃据的主要地区西苏门答腊通往南苏门答腊的重要公路枢纽。据报道，叛乱集团用的石油是从这里运去的，叛乱集团的“信使”也是常常通过这里到其他地方去的。政府军在收复双溪冷沙之后，就有可能切断叛乱集团逃往占碑和南苏门答腊的道路。
    雅加达各报今天都报道，政府军在最近即将对侯赛尼叛乱集团的巢穴武吉丁宜和巴东发动最后阶段的攻击。
    侯赛尼叛乱集团由于外临政府军的猛攻，同时内又遭到当地人民和对它不满的部队的反对，已经更加慌乱。叛乱集团现在正加紧迫使学生当兵，拼凑新部队，作最后的挣扎。
