Small Common Knowledge

    Green manure is one of the main sources of farm manure in the rice-growing areas of the South. The farmers there say, "One year of red clover, three years of good soil," and "One point of grass seed, one point of harvest." From this, we can know the important role of green manure in increasing agricultural production.
    The main types of green manure are: milk vetch, vetch, alfalfa, fodder radish, and broad beans, peas, etc. Milk vetch is mainly distributed in: Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan provinces, northern Guangdong and Huanggang, Hubei, etc. Vetch is mainly distributed in: Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan and southern Shaanxi, northern Guangxi. Alfalfa is distributed in: coastal Jiangsu, Zhejiang and northern Jiangsu. Fodder radish is distributed in: southern and central Jiangxi, northern Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, Hunan, Guizhou and other provinces. The area where broad beans and peas are used as green manure is not large, and the distribution is also scattered.
    Green manure is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and other fertilizers. One mu of green manure (calculated at 3,000 jin) contains nitrogen equivalent to 50 to 80 jin of ammonium sulfate.

    绿肥
    绿肥是南方水稻地区主要农家肥源之一。那里的农民都说：“一年红花草，三年好地脚”，“一分草子一分年成”。由此就可以知道，绿肥在农业增产上的重要作用。
    绿肥主要种类有：紫云英、苕子、金花菜、肥田萝卜和蚕豆、豌豆等。紫云英主要分布在：江西、湖南、浙江和江苏、安徽、河南三省的南部，广东北部和湖北黄岗等地。苕子主要分布在：四川、湖北、湖南和陕西南部，广西北部。金花菜分布在：江苏、浙江沿海和江苏北部。肥田萝卜分布在：江西南部、中部，广东、广西北部和福建、湖南、贵州等省。蚕豆、豌豆用作绿肥面积不大，分布也很零星。
    绿肥含有丰富的氮、磷、钾等肥分，一亩绿肥（以三千斤计算）所含的氮相当于五十到八十斤硫酸铵。
