    Don't Penny-Pinch and Lose Big
    Li Yonggen, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology
    One afternoon last week, I encountered such a woman on Beijing Route 3 bus. She was holding a small child and also had a child of about five years old with her. After she got on the bus, she immediately shouted for the child to sit down, but the child did not like to sit. The mother was very anxious, and under the repeated urging of the mother, the child reluctantly sat down temporarily. Only then did the mother go to buy a ticket. At this time, the conductor said, "What about the child's ticket?" She said, "The child is small, can't I avoid buying it? I've never bought one before." The conductor said, "Look, isn't he taller than the standard red line!" She looked back and the child was standing! There was no other way but to buy another ticket. Then she angrily said to the child, "Sit down! This child is so stupid, why did you get up?" The innocent and intelligent child didn't know what to do. It seems that the child does not understand his mother's thoughts. But may I ask this mother: Is it worth giving the child this kind of mental blow for seven cents? More importantly, she will pass on her bad behavior to the child, which is really penny-pinching and losing big.

    不要因小失大
    北京钢铁学院　李永根
    在上星期的有一个下午，我在北京三路公共汽车上遇到了这样的一位妇女。她抱着一个小孩子又带了一个大约五岁的孩子。她上车以后马上连声喊叫要孩子坐下，但这孩子很不喜欢坐。妈妈非常着急，在妈妈的再三督促下孩子勉强暂时坐下来了。妈妈这才去买了一张票。这时售票员说：“孩子的票呢？”她说：“孩子小，可以不买吗？从来也没有买过。”售票员说：“你看他不是高于标准红线了吗！”她回头一看孩子正站着呢！没有办法，只好又买了一张票。然后气愤愤地对孩子说：“坐下！这孩子这么笨，你干么起来了？”弄得天真聪明的孩子不知道怎样才好。看来孩子还不懂得妈妈的心事。但请问这位当妈妈的：为了七分钱，给孩子这种精神打击合得来吗？更重要的，她还会把自己的不良行为传给孩子，那才是因小失大呢。
