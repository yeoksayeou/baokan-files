Is it better to rely solely on a few people for checking, evaluating, and urging production, or is it better to mobilize the masses to check, evaluate, and urge? Is it better to rely only on a few people to statically identify advanced elements, or is it better for everyone to compare, learn from, and catch up with advanced elements? Is it better to rely only on a few people to discover backwardness or to passively inspect backwardness, or is it better for everyone to discover and eliminate backwardness? We have found vivid answers to these questions from the work of the Qujing Prefectural Committee's spring plowing inspection team. Here, everyone can clearly see how much impact improving leadership methods and changing work styles have on promoting current production! In the face of the new task of leading the masses to fight against nature, leadership methods must adapt to the current new situation. Of course, this is an arduous task, unfamiliar to some leaders and even the masses, but it is extremely important.

    值得学习
    在检查生产中，只是依靠少数人的查、评、督促好呢，还是发动群众来查、来评、来督促好呢？是只依靠少数人静止地找先进呢，还是大家来比先进、学先进、赶先进呢？是只依靠少数人来发现落后或是消极地检查落后好呢，还是大家来发现落后、消灭落后好呢？这些问题，我们从曲靖地委春耕检查团的工作中得到了生动的解答。在这里，大家可以清楚地看到：改进领导方法、转变工作作风，对于促进当前生产有多么大的作用！在领导群众向自然作斗争的新任务面前，领导方法必须适应当前新的形势。当然，这是一项艰苦的工作，对若干领导人以至群众都很生疏，但却是极端重要的。
