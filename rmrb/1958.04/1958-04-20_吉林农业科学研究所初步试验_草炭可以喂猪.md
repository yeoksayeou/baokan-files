Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, April 19th: Preliminary experiments at the Jilin Academy of Agricultural Sciences have shown that peat can be used to feed pigs.

In 1956 and 1957, researchers at the institute fed twenty-one pigs with peat in batches. In the first batch in 1956, four K'lang pigs were fed with feed containing 60% peat, and the average daily weight gain was 1.9 taels per head (a Northeast catty is 10 taels, same below); in the second batch in 1957, seventeen K'lang pig sows were fed with the same feed, and the average daily weight gain was 1.85 taels per head. After slaughter, the pigs fed with peat were examined, and there were no abnormalities in the internal organs, and the taste of the meat was as delicious as that of ordinary pork.

According to preliminary tests, peat contains 12.92% of the main nutrient protein, and pigs have no adverse effects on appetite after eating it. This year, the institute plans to conduct large-scale experiments to further confirm its effectiveness.

Jilin Province has abundant peat reserves. According to a survey in 1956, the province has 1.3 billion cubic meters of peat, covering an area of 110,000 hectares, which was previously used directly as a source of fertilizer. If it can be used as pig feed, it can greatly promote the development of the pig industry.

    吉林农业科学研究所初步试验
    草炭可以喂猪
    新华社长春19日电　草炭可以喂猪，这是吉林省农业科学研究所初步试验得出的结果。
    这个研究所人员在1956年、1957年曾分批用草炭喂养了二十一头猪。第一批1956年用草炭占60％的饲料喂养四头克郎猪，平均每头每天长肉一两九钱（东北一斤为十两，下同）；第二批1957年用同样饲料喂养十七头克郎猪母猪，平均每天每头长肉一两八钱五分。这些掺用草炭喂的猪经宰后检查，内脏各器官并无任何不正常现象，肉的味道也同一般猪肉一样鲜美。
    据初步化验，草炭内含有主要营养成分蛋白质12.92％，猪吃了对食欲没有任何不良影响。这个研究所今年准备大批试验，以便进一步肯定它的效果。
    吉林省蕴藏草炭较多。据1956年普查，全省有草炭十三亿立方公尺，面积十一万公顷，过去直接作为肥料来源。如果能作为猪的饲料，就可以大大促进养猪业的发展。
