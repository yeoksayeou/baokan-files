Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Buenos Aires, April 25th (TASS) - The United States' intention to raise import taxes on Chilean copper has aroused extreme dissatisfaction among the Chilean public.

According to "Ultima Hora," members of parliament from various parties in both the House of Representatives and the Senate have issued statements condemning U.S. trade policies. Correa, a United Conservative Party congressman, said that if the U.S. plan is implemented, it will have an extremely negative impact on the Chilean economy and will increase unemployment. Ulloa, a Popular Action Front congressman, said that the measures the United States intends to take are "tantamount to aggression against our country." He emphasized: "Chile should protest and deal with the United States in the same way it deals with us." Cademartori, professor of economics at the University of Chile and a member of the Popular Action Front, fiercely criticized the U.S. position as inconsistent with its so-called "Inter-American cooperation" rhetoric. He said that the U.S. authorities are actually attempting to "forcibly implement social and economic oppression policies to prevent the advancement of popular forces." He also said, "Raising import taxes on copper also illustrates the weakness of the U.S. economy. The arms race and the approach of economic crisis and depression have filled the U.S. economy with contradictions."

While condemning U.S. trade policies, Chilean congressmen emphasized that Chile should expand its sales markets and trade with all countries in the world, including countries in the socialist camp.

Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Buenos Aires dispatch - The Argentine magazine "Veritas" published an article on the economic situation in Peru. The article stated: "Peru is currently experiencing a crisis caused by a shortage of foreign exchange."

The article pointed out that due to Peru's continuous inflation and increasing national budget deficit, the purchasing power of the Sol (Peruvian currency) has declined, and it is expected that Peru "will inevitably experience rising prices and living costs."

The article said that due to the decline in prices of steel, lead, and zinc, the production volume of these metals has been reduced. "Mining operations in many mines have been paralyzed, resulting in an increase in unemployment."

The magazine pointed out that U.S. policies have greatly damaged Peru's economic situation. The U.S. Congress's intention to raise metal import taxes and its intention to stop metal imports have made Peru uneasy. At the same time, the U.S. government has also begun to push Peruvian cotton out of its traditional markets. This has resulted in Chile, the main importer of Peruvian cotton, acquiring approximately 25% less Peruvian cotton in 1957 than in 1956.

Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Montevideo dispatch - The Uruguayan Communist Party's "Estudios" magazine published an article by Eduardo Viera in its March issue entitled "The Economic Crisis in Uruguay."

The author pointed out that due to political subservience to Washington's hegemonic policies in recent years, the crisis in the Uruguayan economic system has intensified, and this crisis is intertwined with the impact of U.S. economic instability and the agricultural crisis that is sweeping countries like Uruguay.

The article cited materials showing that in recent years Uruguay's industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry have experienced a recession. The Peso (Uruguayan currency) is constantly depreciating, and the number of unemployed is increasing. From 1954 to 1957, in the steel industry, the number of workers in twelve large enterprises decreased by 55%. In individual enterprises, the decrease was 70%.

The article then pointed out that after the Second World War, North American capital intensified its penetration into Uruguay. U.S. direct investment in Uruguayan industry and commerce reached 75 million US dollars. These foreign capital investments seriously hindered the process of expanded reproduction. A considerable portion of the profits are transferred abroad every year. The United States not only refuses to supply Uruguay with lathes that are urgently needed for industrial development in the post-war period, but even the things that the United States sells to Uruguay are always stipulated at particularly high prices or simply leased at high rents.

At the end of the war, Uruguay had gold reserves of 119 million US dollars in the United States alone. But after a few years, these reserves were exhausted, and Uruguay had to remit 14 tons of gold worth 16 million US dollars to the United States. At the same time, the U.S. market was flooded with American goods, and the prices of U.S. exports also increased, while the prices of Uruguayan raw materials fell and exports decreased. From 1947 to 1956, Uruguay's foreign trade deficit reached nearly 82 million US dollars.

The author pointed out that the Uruguayan people's struggle against U.S. policies has been intensifying recently. The national bourgeoisie, and even some large bourgeoisie, oppose the U.S. State Department's policies. The policies of U.S. monopoly organizations are opposed by the Uruguayan working class and the people, because they want to turn Uruguay into their colony. Now, the vast majority of people are very clear that the North American road is a suicidal road for Uruguay. The article finally called for expanding trade relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries as a way out for Uruguay to solve its economic problems.

### 美国向南美转嫁经济危机  智利等国公众反美呼声高昂

    美国向南美转嫁经济危机
    智利等国公众反美呼声高昂
    据新华社26日讯　塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯25日讯：美国打算提高智利铜的进口税，引起了智利公众的极端不满。
    据“最后一点钟报”报道，众议院和参议院各个政党的议员都发表声明，谴责美国的贸易政策。联合保守党众议员科里亚说，美国的计划一旦实现将对智利经济产生极其恶劣的影响，并且将使失业增加。人民行动阵线众议员乌约阿说，美国打算采取的措施“无异于对我国侵略”。他强调说：“智利应当抗议，并且用美国对付我们的办法来对付它。”智利大学经济系教授、人民行动阵线众议员卡德马托里猛烈抨击美国的立场同它所谓“美洲国家合作”的论调是不相符的。他说，美国当局实际上企图“强制实行社会和经济方面的压迫政策，以阻止人民力量的前进”。他又说，“提高铜的进口税也说明了美国经济的虚弱。军备竞赛以及经济危机和萧条的临近使美国经济充满了矛盾。”
    智利众议员们在谴责美国贸易政策的同时强调指出，智利应当扩大销售市场，并且同世界一切国家进行贸易，其中包括社会主义阵营各国。
    据新华社26日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷杂志“维里塔斯”发表了一篇有关秘鲁经济情况的文章。文章说：“现在秘鲁正经历着外汇不足所引起的危机。”
    文章指出，由于秘鲁通货膨胀和国家预算赤字不断增加，索尔（秘鲁的货币）的购买力下降了，预料秘鲁“必然会产生物价和生活费用上涨”的局面。
    文章说，由于钢、铅、锌价格下降，这些金属的生产量已经缩减。“许多矿井的采矿工作陷于瘫痪状态，因而造成失业人数的增加”。
    杂志指出，美国的政策对秘鲁的经济情况有很大损害。美国国会打算提高金属进口税，并且打算停止金属进口，这使秘鲁感到不安。同时，美国政府还开始把秘鲁棉花从它的传统市场上排挤出去。这就使得秘鲁棉花的主要进口国智利在1957年收购的秘鲁棉花比1956年减少了大约25％。
    据新华社26日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：乌拉圭共产党的“研究”杂志3月号发表了埃杜阿多·韦埃尔的一篇文章，题目是“乌拉圭的经济危机”。
    作者指出，由于最近几年来政治上屈从于华盛顿的蛮横政策，乌拉圭经济制度的危机已经加剧，这种危机同美国经济的不稳定所产生的影响和遍及像乌拉圭这样一些国家的农业危机是互相交错起来的。
    文章援引的材料说明，近几年来乌拉圭的工业、农业和畜牧业都出现了萧条现象。比索（乌拉圭货币）不断贬值，失业人数在增加。从1954年到1957年，在钢铁工业方面，十二个大企业的工人人数减少了55％。在个别企业中减少了70％。
    文章接着指出，第二次世界大战之后，北美资本加紧向乌拉圭渗入。美国向乌拉圭工业和商业的直接投资达七千五百万美元。这些外国资本严重地阻碍了扩大再生产的过程。每年都有相当大一部分利润转送到国外去。美国不仅拒绝向乌拉圭战后时期急需发展的工业供应车床，而且就是美国卖给乌拉圭的那些东西也总是规定特别高昂的价格或者干脆以高价的租金出租。
    在战争结束后，乌拉圭仅在美国的黄金储备有一亿一千九百万美元。但是几年之后这些储备消耗殆尽，于是乌拉圭不得不向美国转寄总值达一千六百万美元的十四吨黄金。同时，美国商品充斥乌拉圭市场，加上美国出口商品的价格也提高了，而乌拉圭原料的价格却下跌，出口额也减少了。从1947年到1956年，乌拉圭的对外贸易逆差几乎达到了八千二百万美元。
    作者指出，乌拉圭人民群众反对美国政策的斗争近来日益加强。民族资产阶级，甚至某些大资产阶级都反对美国国务院的方针。美国垄断组织的政策遭到乌拉圭工人阶级和人民的反对，因为它们要把乌拉圭变为自己的殖民地。现在，绝大多数人民都十分清楚，北美的道路对乌拉圭是一条自杀的道路。文章最后要求扩大同苏联和其他社会主义国家的贸易关系，作为乌拉圭解决经济问题的一条出路。
