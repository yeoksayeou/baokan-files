    Baolan Railway Enters the Desert
    Track-laying Project Advances Day and Night
    The track-laying project for the southern section of the Baolan Railway has entered the Tengger Desert. Currently, the track-laying workers are overcoming sandstorm obstacles and advancing day and night.
    This section of the railway, from Gantang Station northwards to Zhongwei Station, passes through a section of mobile desert. All of the special desert subgrade has been constructed, and long sand fences have been built on both sides of the roadbed. It is the first time that a railway has been built on such a mobile desert in our country.
    This year, the southern section of the Baolan Railway is scheduled to lay 320 kilometers of track, and it is expected that the track will be laid to Yinchuan by the end of August, connecting with the northern section of the railway.

    包兰路进入大沙漠
    铺轨工程日夜挺进
    包兰铁路南段的铺轨工程进入腾格里大沙漠。现在，铺轨工人正在排除风沙障碍，日夜向前挺进。
    这段铁路从干塘车站向北到中卫车站止经过移动性沙漠的一段，全部沙漠特殊路基已经修筑好，路基两旁也筑起了长长的防沙栏。在这样移动性的大沙漠上建设铁路，在我国还是第一次。
    包兰铁路南段今年要铺轨三百二十公里，预计8月底可以铺到银川，同北段铁路接轨。
