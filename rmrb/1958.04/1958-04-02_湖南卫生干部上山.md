Hunan Health Cadres Go to the Mountains

(Our report) More than 200 senior and mid-level health technicians from Hunan Province went to work in various counties of the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and the Qianyang Special District at the end of March.

Most areas of Hunan are mountainous. There are many endemic diseases in the mountains. Of the 37 counties with high malaria incidence in the province, 31 are mountainous counties; mountain areas account for 96.8% of the province's leprosy patients; schistosomiasis and goiter are also common. These diseases seriously threaten the health of the people in the mountains and affect their labor production. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the call for "health technicians to go to the mountains," which was immediately supported by the vast number of health cadres. More than 95% of the health technicians in Changsha's health units and directly affiliated units of the Provincial Health Department applied to go to the mountains, expressing their desire to go to the most difficult places and bring health technology to the people in the mountains. The Changsha Women and Children Health Hospital also organized senior doctors to help the midwives going to the mountains solve difficult labor techniques and taught them how to use forceps.

    湖南卫生干部上山
    本报讯　湖南省二百多名高、中级卫生技术人员，3月底去湘西土家族苗族自治州和黔阳专区各县工作。
    湖南大部分地区是山区。山区的地方病较多，全省三十七个高疟县中，山区就占三十一个县；山区麻疯病患者占全省96.8％；血丝虫病、甲状腺肿等疾病也不少。这些疾病严重地威胁着山区人民的健康，影响他们的劳动生产。最近，中共湖南省委发出“卫生技术上山”的号召，立即受到广大卫生干部拥护。长沙市卫生单位和省卫生厅直属单位有95％以上的卫生技术干部申请上山，他们表示要到最艰苦的地方去，把卫生技术带给山区人民。长沙妇幼保健院还组织高级医师帮助上山的助产士解决难产技术问题，并且教会他们用产钳。
