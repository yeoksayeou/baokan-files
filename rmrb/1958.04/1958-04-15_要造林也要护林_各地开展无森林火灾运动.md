Xinhua News Agency, April 12th: Following the upsurge in afforestation, a forest fire prevention campaign has emerged across the country.

This spring, various regions have made arrangements for forest protection and fire prevention. Jilin Province began dispatching forest protection and fire prevention inspection teams in early April to delve into forest areas and promote forest protection and fire prevention work. Henan Province proposed thorough publicity, leaving no village, household, or individual untouched; sound organization, with someone responsible for every mountain, slope, and tree; and everyone adhering to fire prevention regulations, leaving no loopholes for mountain fires, striving to eliminate forest fires. Since last autumn and winter, many provinces have mobilized the masses to open up firebreaks on a large scale, reducing the threat of fire to forests and laying the foundation for this spring's fire prevention work. To take timely and effective fire prevention and firefighting measures, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Inner Mongolia have begun to forecast dangerous weather conditions for forest fires.

Some provinces and autonomous regions have also launched mass debates on forest protection and fire prevention, combined with the upsurge in rural "speaking out," and activities such as forest protection and fire prevention publicity months and weeks, further enhancing the understanding of cadres and the masses, and boosting their enthusiasm for eliminating forest fires. On this basis, many counties, townships, communes, and forest farms have launched challenge competitions of "comparing mass organizations, comparing fire prevention systems, comparing publicity, comparing facilities, comparing fire source control, comparing policy implementation, and comparing the occurrence of fires." According to statistics since January, forest fires in Yunnan, Shanxi, Sichuan, and other provinces have been greatly reduced compared to the same period last year. Henan Province has basically eliminated forest fires from January to the present. However, fires are still very serious in some areas. For example, in Longlin Autonomous County of various ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Qiubei, Shizong, and Mile Yi Autonomous Counties in Yunnan Province, and Luding, Heishui, Markang, and Tongjiang in Sichuan Province, Yongxiu in Jiangxi Province, and Longyan in Fujian Province, there have been major mountain fires. These places must continue to muster their efforts and take effective measures to eliminate the fires that have already occurred.

### 要造林也要护林  各地开展无森林火灾运动

    要造林也要护林
    各地开展无森林火灾运动
    据新华社12日讯　继植树造林高潮之后，全国各地又出现“无森林火灾”的护林防火运动。
    各地今春都分别布置了护林防火工作。吉林省从4月上旬开始，分批派出护林防火检查组，深入林区推动护林防火工作。河南省提出要宣传深透，不漏一村一户一人；组织健全，一山一坡一树都有人负责；人人遵守防火规定，不留一点山火漏洞，争取消灭森林火灾。从去年秋冬开始，就有很多省发动群众大量开辟防火线，减少火灾对森林的威胁，给今春防火工作打下了基础。为了及时采取有效的防火和救火措施，吉林、黑龙江和内蒙古等地已开始进行森林火灾危险天气预报。
    有些省、自治区还结合农村鸣放高潮，展开了群众性的护林防火大辩论，和护林防火宣传月、宣传周等活动，进一步提高了干部和群众的认识，鼓起了消灭森林火灾的干劲。在这个基础上，很多县、乡、社和林场，掀起了“比群众组织、比防火制度、比宣传、比设施、比控制火源、比执行政策、比有无火灾”的挑战竞赛运动。据1月份以来的统计，云南、山西、四川等省山林火灾已比去年同时期大大减少。河南省从1月份到现在，已基本上杜绝了山林火灾。但是目前在个别地区火灾仍很严重。如广西僮族自治区的隆林各族自治县，云南省的丘北、师宗和弥勒彝族自治县，四川省的泸定、黑水、马尔康、通江，江西省的永修，福建省的龙岩等县，都有较大的山火发生，这些地方必须继续鼓起干劲，采取有效措施，来消灭已经发生的火灾。
