    Spring plowing inspection teams are production promotion teams. Pan'an County achieved great results by grasping measures, grasping ideology, and grasping both ends.
    (Reported by this newspaper) Pan'an County, Zhejiang Province, adopted correct mass line working methods. In late March, they launched a vibrant spring plowing production inspection and appraisal campaign, which greatly promoted spring sowing and fertilizer accumulation.
    The spring plowing production inspection and appraisal campaign in Pan'an County had a very clear working principle. This principle was: not only to inspect and discover problems, but also to help solve them; not only to learn from the advanced, but also to widely carry out propaganda and education. According to this principle, the Pan'an County inspection team was both a work team and a production team, both a learning team and a propaganda team. They inspected where they went, worked where they went, produced where they went, and studied and publicized where they went. In just five days, the inspection and appraisal campaign achieved excellent results, and a new upsurge of production and rectification emerged throughout the county. The inspection team of more than two thousand people became a work team for promoting advanced experience, organizing fertilizer accumulation campaigns, and promoting cooperative rectification. The representatives of various townships who participated in the inspection team received rich education in the inspection and appraisal, broke various conservative ideas, and became pioneers and backbones in leading the great leap forward in production.
    After the inspection team arrived at a place, they immediately demonstrated with their own actions while inspecting. For example, when the inspection team arrived at the first cooperative of Shanhuan Township, they found that the fertilizer accumulation work of this cooperative was very poor, and the foundation mud had not been touched. They immediately took action and dug more than 800 loads of foundation mud. The cooperative cadres and members were extremely moved by this situation. All the men, women, old, and young in the cooperative got up before dawn the next day to accumulate fertilizer. In five days, the amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu increased by 388 loads, and the average amount per mu, including the original amount, reached 579 loads. This cooperative jumped from being backward to being advanced. During a field inspection in Shangyu Cooperative, Jiuhe Township, the inspection team found that wheat fields were infested with red spiders. They immediately helped the cooperative buy 120 jin of "666" powder to eliminate the red spiders, and the members were very grateful.
    The inspection team universally mobilized and organized cooperative members to conduct extensive debates during the inspection and appraisal, presented facts, reasoned, solved ideological problems of cadres and masses, and promoted backward units to catch up quickly. Generally, inspections were conducted during the day, and reports and appraisals were made in the evening. In the reports and appraisals, the inspection team used the advanced and backward examples found in the inspection to educate production team cadres and cooperative members, and mobilized the masses to debate, which had a very good effect. For example, during an inspection in Renchuan Township, the inspection team found that there were still many single-cropping fields in this township this year, about 860 mu in the whole township. The inspection team representatives, on the one hand, used the township's plan of 1,200 jin to calculate the accounts, pointing out that the plan could not be realized if the single-cropping fields were not transformed. On the other hand, they compared the conditions of the township and cooperative with Renchuan Township, and sharply criticized their conservative ideas. Through this fierce debate, the ideological problems among the cadres above the team leader level in Renchuan Township were finally resolved. They unanimously decided to eliminate all single-cropping fields and went to the county to pick seeds the next day.
    During the inspection and appraisal, the inspection team also paid attention to helping local cooperatives find and overcome obstacles in their work in accordance with the conditions of the cooperative and the local conditions. They went deep into reality to discover and overcome problems. For example, the Victory and Peace agricultural cooperatives in Sixie Township had food problems, and some members deliberately did not attend work when the inspection team arrived. After the inspection team went deep into the poor and lower-middle peasant members to investigate the situation of grain unified sales, they found that the main problem was ideology. They assisted the township branch in convening a meeting of cadres above the team leader level in the township to conduct a major debate on the grain issue, clarifying ideas and demarcating boundaries, so that the cadres of the township dispelled their fear of difficulties, boosted their energy, and immediately led the masses to carry out production.
    In the inspection and appraisal, the inspection team always attached importance to the method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle, and widely carried out mass commendation and criticism, using various methods such as big-character posters, clapper talk, cartoons, and debate meetings to commend and promote advanced experiences. At the same time, they helped backward units find the reasons, grasp the measures, and catch up with advanced units. For example, they learned and introduced the advanced experience of deep-water cooperative in direct seeding and seedling cultivation; they found that the method of accumulating fertilizer in the charcoal kiln of Shanghu Township was very good, so they quickly promoted it throughout the township.
    Through inspection and appraisal, the spring sowing and fertilizer accumulation work in Pan'an County leaped forward by leaps and bounds. The early rice seedlings in the whole county were generally cultivated strong and timely prevented frost damage, and no rotten seedlings occurred. The progress of fertilizer accumulation was not fast before the inspection was carried out. The whole county only accumulated more than 11 million loads of fertilizer, an average of 113 loads per mu. In the process of carrying out mass inspection, various places universally made concentrated efforts to accumulate fertilizer. In six or seven days, the fertilizer accumulation in the whole county jumped to more than 39 million loads, an average of 382 loads per mu, more than twice the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in the five and a half months before the inspection. There were originally more than 4,800 mu of backward seedlings in spring flowers in the whole county. During the inspection process, the members made concentrated efforts to apply fertilizer, and now more than 3,800 mu of backward seedlings have been eliminated. The inspection team found that there were still more than 9,200 mu of backward fields in the county that only planned to grow one crop, so they helped study various methods to transform the backward fields. Now, more than 4,200 mu of these fields have been converted to grow two or three crops. In addition, the inspection found that there were 70 cooperatives of three types in the county. After taking effective measures, 34 cooperatives have now caught up with the second-class cooperatives, 14 cooperatives have caught up with the first-class cooperatives, and the other 22 cooperatives have also undergone varying degrees of transformation.

    春耕检查团是生产促进团
    磐安县用抓措施抓思想抓两头的方法收到很大实效
    本报讯　浙江省磐安县采取正确的群众路线的工作方法，在3月下旬开展了一次有声有色的春耕生产检查评比运动，对春播和积肥工作起了巨大的促进作用。
    磐安县春耕生产检查评比运动有十分明确的工作方针。这个方针是：既要检查发现问题，又要帮助解决问题，既要学习先进，又要广泛开展宣传教育工作。根据这个方针，磐安县检查团做到了既是工作队又是生产队，既是学习队又是宣传队。他们检查到那里，工作到那里，生产到那里，学习宣传到那里。在短短的五天中，检查评比运动收到了极好的效果，全县出现一个生产和整改的新高潮。二千多人的检查团成了一支推广先进经验、组织积肥高潮和推动合作社整改的工作队。各乡参加检查团的代表，在检查评比中更受到了丰富的教育，打破了各种保守思想，回去后成为领导生产大跃进的先锋和骨干。
    检查团每到一地以后，一面检查，一面立即用自己的行动进行示范。例如检查团到了山环乡一社，发现这个社积肥工作很差，屋基泥未动，他们立即行动起来，挖了八百多担屋基泥，社干部和社员群众看到这种情况极为感动。全社男女老少第二天天未亮就起来积肥，五天中每亩增积了三百八十八担，平均每亩连原有的已达五百七十九担，这个社由落后一跃而为先进。检查团在九和乡上俞社田间检查中发现麦田红蜘蛛为害，立即帮助社里买了一百二十斤“六六六”粉扑灭红蜘蛛，社员都非常感激。
    检查团在检查评比中普遍地发动和组织社员群众大辩论，摆事实，讲道理，解决干部和群众的思想问题，促使落后单位迅速赶上来。一般在白天检查，晚上汇报评比。在汇报评比中，检查团用检查出来的先进和落后事例，教育生产队干部和社员群众，并且发动群众辩论，效果很好。如检查团在仁川乡检查发现这个乡今年一熟田仍然很多，全乡约有八百六十亩。检查团代表一方面以这个乡今年一千二百斤规划对照算账，指出一熟田不改造不能实现规划，另一方面又纷纷以乡社的条件与仁川乡对比，对他们的保守思想作了尖锐批评。通过这场激烈辩论，终于解决了仁川乡小队长以上干部中的思想问题。他们一致决议全部消灭一熟田，并且第二天就到县里去挑种子。
    检查团在检查评比中，还注意了因社制宜、因地制宜地帮助当地合作社，找出和克服工作中的障碍。他们深入实际，发现和克服问题。如四协乡的胜利、和平两个农业社闹粮食问题，部分社员故意在检查团来到时不出勤。检查团深入到雇贫农社员中调查了粮食统销情况后，发现主要是思想问题。他们就协助乡支部召开全乡小队长以上的干部会议，进行了一次粮食问题的大辩论，澄清了思想，划清了界线，使得这个乡的干部打消了畏难情绪，鼓起干劲，立即领导群众进行生产。
    在检查评比中，检查团始终重视抓两头带中间的方法，广泛地开展了群众性的表扬和批评，运用了大字报、快板、漫画、辩论会等各种各样的方式，来表扬和推广先进经验，同时帮助落后单位找原因，抓措施，迎头追赶先进单位。例如学习和介绍了深泽社直播育秧的先进的经验；发现尚湖乡烧炭窑积肥办法很好，就迅速在全乡推广。
    通过检查评比，磐安县的春播工作和积肥工作大踏步地向前跃进。全县的早稻秧苗普遍培育得粗壮，防冻及时，没有发生烂秧。积肥工作在未开展检查前进度不快，全县仅积肥一千一百多万担，平均每亩一百一十三担。开展群众性的大检查过程中，各地普遍突击积肥，六、七天时间，全县积肥就跃进到三千九百多万担，平均每亩达三百八十二担，比检查前五个月半积肥总数增加二倍多。全县春花原来有四千八百多亩落后苗，在检查过程中社员都突击追肥，现在已经消灭了三千八百多亩落后苗。检查团检查中发现全县还有九千二百多亩只计划种一熟的落后田，就帮助研究出各种改造落后田的办法，现在这些田中已有四千二百多亩改为种二熟或三熟。此外，检查中还发现全县有三类社七十个。经过采取有效的措施，现在已有三十四个社赶上二类社，有十四个社赶上一类社，其他二十二个社也有不同程度的转变。
