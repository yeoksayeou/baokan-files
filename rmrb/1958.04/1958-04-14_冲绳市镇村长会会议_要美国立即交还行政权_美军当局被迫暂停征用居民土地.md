Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: In the face of strong opposition from Okinawa residents to the U.S. military's practice of permanently requisitioning land by paying land rent in a lump sum, U.S. High Commissioner to Okinawa, Moore, said on the 11th that he had ordered a temporary halt to this method of land requisition.

Recently, the people of Okinawa have become increasingly determined in their demands for the return of sovereignty over Okinawa Island to Japan and oppose the U.S. plan to permanently occupy Okinawa Island and the Ogasawara Islands. At a leadership cadre meeting held on the 10th, the Okinawa City, Town, and Village Mayors' Association passed a resolution demanding that the United States abolish Article 3 of the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" with Japan (which stipulates that Japan agrees to the U.S. trusteeship of Okinawa Island and the Ogasawara Islands), immediately return administrative rights over Okinawa Island to Japan, and revoke the Price proposal advocating the forced requisition of land from the people of Okinawa by paying land rent in a lump sum.

    冲绳市镇村长会会议
    要美国立即交还行政权
    美军当局被迫暂停征用居民土地
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：在冲绳居民强烈反对美军采用一次付清地租的办法长期征用土地的情况下，美国驻冲绳高级专员穆尔在11日说，他已经下令暂时停止采用这种征用土地的办法。
    冲绳人民最近愈来愈坚决地要求把冲绳岛的主权归还日本，反对美国长期霸占冲绳岛和小笠原群岛的计划。冲绳市、镇、村长会在10日举行的领导干部会议中作出决议，要求美国废除旧金山对日“和约”第三条（这一条规定日本同意由美国托管冲绳岛和小笠原群岛），立即把冲绳岛的行政权归还给日本；撤销主张以一次付清地租的方式强制征用冲绳人民土地的普赖斯建议。
