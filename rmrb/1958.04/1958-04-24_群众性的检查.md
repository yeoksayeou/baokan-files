    Mass Inspection
    Tian Lianqian
    In a certain area of Hubei, an agricultural cooperative hastily planted a "Thousand Jin [500kg] Trademark" sign in the field the day before a higher-level inspection of spring plowing. This thousand-jin target was neither discussed by the masses nor had practical measures, it was mainly to cope with the inspection. Although this phenomenon is isolated, it reflects a very important issue: inspection work must also mobilize the masses and form a mass movement. Relying solely on a few cadres for inspection cannot achieve the desired results.
    In the past, when many places carried out inspection work, they would send a few cadres to a township or cooperative to stay for a few days, understand the situation, collect some materials, and then return to the office to study, analyze, and propose problems to be reported to various places. Mass inspection is not like this. The members of the inspection team are not only cadres from leading organs, but also cadres from townships, cooperatives, and teams, as well as experienced farmers; not only ordinary cadres, but also scientific and technical personnel. Problems are discovered and resolved on the spot. Most areas now adopt this inspection method. Some places have also launched a broader and deeper inspection movement among the masses, with greater results. The continuous inspection and acceptance system promoted in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, is one example. These are two different inspection methods. These two methods have two different effects in actual work: organizing mass inspections is a method adapted to the current situation of the Great Leap Forward, with more people participating in the inspection, a wider range of inspection, and more problems discovered and solved. The masses are the formulators and executors of production plans. They understand the actual situation best. With their participation, the inspection can not only be in-depth and meticulous, and can make up for the shortcomings of inspections by a few leaders, but also achieve simultaneous inspection and correction, so that problems can be discovered quickly and solved well. This is a method of inspection that achieves greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and should be vigorously promoted. Sending a few cadres to inspect is a small-scale working method that lags behind the objective situation. Although it can also play some role, it is far inferior to the former.
    Mass inspections can also promote mutual learning, learn from each other's strengths, and quickly spread advanced experiences. Many township and cooperative cadres believed that their unit's production was already good and their enthusiasm was already high before participating in the inspection. When they saw that others were doing better than themselves during the inspection, they mustered greater enthusiasm and immediately sent letters and messages to pass on good experiences and methods from other places to their own units. This will quickly set off a wave of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced.
    Will such a large-scale inspection affect production? It is clear that the inspection method promoted in Changzhi Prefecture, because they are several operating processes linked together and combined with production for inspection, not only does not affect production, but also mutually restricts and promotes each other, thereby improving the quality of cultivation. As for the people who leave their own township or cooperative to inspect other townships or cooperatives with the inspection team, from their own perspective, they are delayed production to some extent; there are some losses, but from a comprehensive point of view, solving problems and learning experience, the role it plays in promoting production far exceeds this so-called "loss." Our cause is collective, and individual interests are consistent with collective interests. As long as it is beneficial to the entire cause, it is a good thing and should be done. Things that are detrimental to the overall situation, no matter how beneficial they are to individuals, should not be done. Whether it affects production should be considered from the perspective of overall interests.

    群众性的检查
    田连阡
    湖北某地有一个农业社，在上级派人检查春耕的前一天，慌忙在地里插上个“千斤牌”。这个千斤指标既未经过群众讨论，也没有切实的措施，主要是为了应付一下检查。这现象虽然是个别的，但却反映了一个很重要的问题：检查工作也必须发动群众，形成群众运动。仅凭少数干部检查，就不能收到预期的效果。
    过去，许多地方检查工作的时候，都是派几个干部到一个乡、一个社住上几天，了解些情况、搜集些材料，再回到机关去研究、分析，提出问题，通报各地。群众性的大检查不是这样。检查团的成员不光是领导机关的干部，还有乡、社、队的干部和有经验的农民；不光是普通干部，还有科学技术人员。发现问题，就地研究解决。现在大部分地区都采取这种检查方法。有的地方还在群众中发起更广泛更深入的检查运动，收效更大。山西长治专区推行的连环检查验收制便是一例。这是两种不同的检查方法。这两种方法在实际工作中有两种不同的效果：组织群众检查是适应目前大跃进形势的方法，参加检查的人多，检查的面广，发现和解决的问题也多。群众是生产计划的制定者和执行者，他们最了解实际情况，有他们参加，不仅检查能够深入细致，可以弥补少数领导者检查的不足，而且能做到边查边改，使问题发现得快，解决得好。这是一种多快好省的检查方法，应该大力提倡。派几个干部检查是落后于客观形势的小手小脚的工作方法，虽然也能起一些作用，但比之前者，那就差得远了。
    群众性的检查还可以互相学习，取长补短，把先进经验很快地传播开来。不少乡社干部在没有参加检查以前，都认为自己单位的生产已经不错，干劲也已经不小，在检查中看到别人比自己更好时，便鼓起更大的干劲，马上捎书带信把外地的好经验好办法传回本单位去。这样便会很快地掀起学先进、赶先进的热潮。
    像这样兴师动众的检查，会不会影响生产呢？很清楚，像长治专区推行的这种检查方法，因为他们是几个操作过程一环套一环地结合生产进行检查的，不仅不影响生产，而且互相制约，互相推动，从而提高了耕作的质量。至于随着检查团离开本乡本社到外乡外社去检查的人，从他本身来看，多少是耽误了一些生产；有一些损失，但从全盘来看，解决了问题，学得了经验，对促进生产所起的作用，也远超过这一点所谓“损失”。我们的事业是集体的，个人利益和集体利益是一致的。只要对整个事业有利，就是好事，就应当干。对整体不利的事，对个人再有好处也不应当干。影响不影响生产，应当从全面利益出发。
