    “Only Four Points Difference”
    Kong Sang
    To say that the experience of Qinghua Tool Factory is a significant innovation is not an overstatement. We see the buds of communism here.

    In this factory, every worker directly participates in management, every cadre participates in labor, and everyone is both a manager and a producer. The workers said, "The only difference between us and the cadres is four points." This means that the only difference is that cadres work four hours while workers work eight hours.

    In order to maintain their position of living without labor, the ruling class of the old society created the fallacy that "those who labor with their minds govern, and those who labor with their strength are governed." That is, manual laborers are born to be managed, while mental laborers (the exploiting class and the intellectuals of the exploiting class) are born to manage others. In the new society, this situation has undergone fundamental changes. Mental labor and manual labor, leadership and being led, are merely different divisions of labor in society. However, on the other hand, the contradiction between mental and manual labor has not been completely resolved today. The form of managing and being managed still exists. In factories, some people are called "management cadres." At the same time, in the management system of enterprises, some remnants of the old society still exist, and some leaders are detached from production and the masses, which are manifestations of these remnants. This situation, to a certain extent, has an impact on the development of the working class's enthusiasm and creativity and will have a negative effect on the development of productive forces. Now, Qinghua Tool Factory has found a way to resolve this contradiction in the enterprise. In their factory, mental laborers must engage in manual labor, and manual laborers must also engage in mental labor; those who are managed must manage others, and those who manage others must also be managed by others. In this way, the difference between mental and manual labor begins to narrow, the relationship between people undergoes profound changes, and people's thinking also undergoes profound changes. Everyone truly feels that they are equal to each other. In this way, people's communist spirit becomes even higher, and their sense of responsibility as masters becomes even stronger. The summary of Qinghua Tool Factory describes this change as follows: "Striving to be advanced has become the atmosphere of the entire factory. There are almost no phenomena of being late, leaving early, or violating labor discipline. The workers' organization and discipline have been strengthened, and they are more united than ever before. Unprecedented leaps have occurred in production. Fifty out of the factory's fifty-four teams want to leap forward by one to eight times. In the week after workers participated in management, production efficiency increased by 12.5%..." The effect of improving interpersonal relationships and changes in people's state of mind on promoting productive forces is powerfully illustrated here.

    After reading the experience of Qinghua Tool Factory, I deeply feel that this is a vivid communist teaching material. It gives us weapons and confidence and helps us move forward towards communism more firmly and optimistically.

    “只差四个点了”
    孔桑
    说庆华工具厂的经验是一项具有重大意义的创举，一点也不过誉。我们从这里看到了共产主义的幼芽。
    在这个工厂里，工人个个直接参加管理工作，干部个个参加劳动，人人都是管理者，又是生产者。工人们说：“我们和干部的区别只差四个点了。”意思是：区别只是干部劳动四小时，工人劳动八小时而已。
    旧社会的统治阶级为了维护他们不劳而食的地位，创造了一套“劳心者治人，劳力者治于人”的谬论。就是说，体力劳动者生来是被人管的，而脑力劳动者（剥削阶级和剥削阶级的知识分子）则生来是管人的。在新社会里，这种状况起了根本的变化，体力劳动与脑力劳动，领导与被领导，只是社会分工不同而已。但是，另一方面，在今天，脑力劳动和体力劳动的矛盾还没有完全解决，管与被管的形式仍然存在，在工厂里，有一部分人就叫做“管理干部”；同时，在企业的管理制度中，有的地方还残存着旧社会的痕迹，有些领导者脱离生产、脱离群众，就是这种残余的表现。这种状况，在一定程度上对工人阶级的积极性和创造性的发扬是有影响的，对生产力的发展也会产生消极的作用。现在，庆华工具厂找到了在企业里解决这个矛盾的途径。在他们那里，脑力劳动者要从事体力劳动，体力劳动者也要从事脑力劳动；被人管的要管人，管人的也要被人管。这样，脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别开始缩小了，人同人的关系发生了深刻的变化，人们的思想也发生了深刻的变化，大家真正感觉到彼此之间是平等的。这样，人们的共产主义精神就更为高涨，主人翁的责任感就更为加强了。庆华工具厂的总结里描述这种变化时写道：“奔向先进成为全厂的气氛，迟到、早退、违犯劳动纪律的现象几乎没有了，工人们的组织性纪律性加强了，彼此之间比任何时候都更加团结，生产上出现了史无前例的跃进。全厂五十四个小组，有五十个要跃进一至八倍。工人参加管理后的一星期中，生产效率提高了12.5％。……”改善人和人的相互关系以及人们思想状态的变化，对促进生产力的作用，在这里得到了十分有力的说明。
    读了庆华工具厂的经验，深深感到这是一篇生动的共产主义教材。它给了我们武器，也给了我们信心，帮助我们更坚定更乐观地向着共产主义前进。
