　　Add Water, Add Fertilizer, Add Processing, Strengthen Wheat Field Management!
　　Henan and Jiangsu Criticize Complacent and Self-Satisfied Moods, Conduct Thorough Inspections
　　(Our Newspaper) News: An urgent mobilization to work hard for a month, further strengthen wheat field management, and overcome several "hurdles" on the road to striving for a bumper wheat harvest. This was proposed by Shi Xiangsheng, Secretary of the CPC Henan Provincial Committee and Vice Governor of Henan Province, in a radio speech to the people of the province last night.
　　Shi Xiangsheng said: At present, wheat is growing well in Henan. Since March 26, although most areas have experienced frost for two consecutive nights, the previous wheat field management was well done, with sufficient manure and water, and vigorous wheat seedlings, resulting in strong disaster resistance and not much damage. Therefore, there is every hope and certainty of achieving a bumper harvest. However, there are still several "hurdles" in front of us, namely: the late frost season is not yet over, and frost may occur again; wheat midge may occur again, especially in the past half month, the wind has been strong, moisture has been rapidly depleted, and some areas, especially sandy areas, are already showing signs of drought. To successfully overcome these hurdles, in addition to preventing frost when it comes and controlling pests when they appear, the decisive measure is to further strengthen wheat field management, conscientiously add water, add fertilizer, and add processing, promote the growth of wheat, improve disaster resistance, and strive for large ears and full grains.
　　After criticizing the complacent and self-satisfied mood of some cadres who believe that the wheat seedlings are growing well, there is sufficient water and fertilizer, and a bumper harvest is guaranteed, Shi Xiangsheng emphasized that leaders at all levels must go deep into the wheat fields, inspect them plot by plot, classify and rank them, and conscientiously strengthen specific leadership over wheat field management. Each agricultural cooperative should assign special personnel to manage wheat fields with poor growth and those severely damaged by the previous frost, adding water where water is lacking and adding fertilizer where fertilizer is lacking. The province should strive to irrigate wheat thoroughly within ten days to half a month and continue to apply top dressing. At the same time, strictly prevent disasters such as frost, hail, and insects. Achieve "expanding first-class wheat fields, reducing second-class wheat fields, and eliminating third-class wheat fields" to ensure an all-round bumper harvest.

　　(Our Newspaper) News: Various parts of Jiangsu Province have broken the complacent idea of ​​"a bumper harvest is certain" and continue to strengthen field management.
　　Jiangsu Province has more than 55 million mu of wheat fields, and the wheat seedlings are growing unprecedentedly well. Barley and naked barley are in the heading stage, and wheat is generally jointing. Since the beginning of spring, various places have generally applied one to two top dressings and carried out weeding and loosening of the soil. However, the rainy season is approaching, and preparations should be made for ditching and drainage, and some areas have already experienced pests and diseases. Some township and cooperative cadres are satisfied with the current situation of more top dressing and better wheat feet this year, and have generated the idea that the "bumper harvest of the three wheats is a foregone conclusion." Party organizations at all levels of the CPC, while educating cadres to overcome the idea of ​​a guaranteed bumper harvest, organized the masses to actively carry out wheat field management tasks such as pest control and ditching. As soon as the CPC Jingjiang County Committee discovered red spider pests in the wheat fields, it quickly established a pest control headquarters to lead the masses in pest control. Gaochun County has 200,000 mu of wheat fields and a high underground water level. It promptly absorbed the experience of veteran farmers, opened the rivers and ditches within the embankments, and reduced the risk of waterlogging to the wheat.

### 加水加肥加工，加强麦田管理！  河南、江苏批判麻痹自满情绪，进行深入检查

    加水加肥加工，加强麦田管理！
    河南、江苏批判麻痹自满情绪，进行深入检查
    本报讯　紧急动员起来，大干一月，进一步加强麦田管理，闯过争取小麦丰收道路上的几“关”。这是中共河南省委书记处书记、河南省副省长史向生昨晚向全省人民发表的广播讲话中提出的。
    史向生说：目前，河南小麦生长良好。自3月26日以来，虽然大部地区一连两夜发生霜冻，但前段麦田管理做得好，粪大水足、麦苗旺盛，抗灾能力强，造成的危害并不大。因而完全有希望、有把握取得大丰收。但是，现在摆在我们面前还有几个“关”，那就是：晚霜期现在还没过，霜冻还有再来的可能；小麦吸浆虫还可能再发生，特别是近半月来风大，耗墒快，有些地方特别是沙区已呈旱象。要想胜利闯过这几关，除了霜来防霜，虫来治虫，决定性的措施就是进一步加强麦田管理，认真加水、加肥、加工，促使小麦长好，提高抗灾能力，争取穗大粒饱。
    史向生批判了目前部分干部认为麦苗长得好，水肥充足，丰收不成问题的麻痹自满情绪以后，强调指出：各级领导必须深入麦田，逐块检查，分类站队，认真加强对麦田管理的具体领导。各农业社对生长较差和前次霜冻受害较重的麦田，要确定专人管理，缺水加水，缺肥加肥。全省在十天到半月内，力争将小麦普浇一遍，继续增施追肥。并同时严防霜冻、风雹、虫等灾害袭击。达到“扩大一类麦田，缩小二类麦田，消灭三类麦田”，保证全面丰收。

    本报讯　江苏省各地打破“丰收笃定”的麻痹思想，继续加强田间管理工作。
    江苏省麦田五千五百多万亩，麦苗生长空前良好，大麦、元麦正在孕穗，小麦普遍拔节。入春以来，各地普遍施了一次到二次追肥，进行了锄草松土。但是，雨季即将到来，应当做好开沟排水的准备工作，部分地区又已经发生病虫害。有些乡、社干部满足于今年追肥多、麦脚好的现状，产生了三麦“丰收大局已定”的思想。中共各级党组织一边教育干部克服丰收笃定的思想，一边组织群众积极进行治虫、开沟等麦田管理工作。中共靖江县委一发现麦田有红蜘蛛的虫害，迅速成立了治虫指挥部，领导群众治虫。高淳县有二十万亩麦田、地下水位较高，及时吸取了老农经验，开放圩内河沟，减少了麦子受内涝的危险。
