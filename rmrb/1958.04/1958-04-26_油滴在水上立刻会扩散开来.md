Why?

    Oil Drops Spread Immediately on Water
    Sesame oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, and rapeseed oil are all liquids lighter than water, and their compositions are also similar. They all contain fatty acids. The main fatty acid is oleic acid. The oleic acid molecule is a polar molecule, and the two ends of the molecule have opposing affinities for water: one end significantly dislikes water, while the other end is significantly attracted to water. When a drop of oil falls on water, the water is very considerate, trying its best to pull the water-loving end of the oleic acid molecule, while pushing away the water-hating end. As a result, the oleic acid molecules stand upright on the water surface, neatly arranged and distributed, spreading into a thin layer floating on the water. This thin layer is exactly the length of one oleic acid molecule.

专栏：为什么？

    油滴在水上立刻会扩散开来
    香油、花生油、豆油和菜油等，都是比水轻的液体，成分也都相似，它们都含有脂肪酸。脂肪酸中主要的又是油酸。油酸分子是个极性分子，分子的两端对于水的爱恶是对立的：一端显著的讨厌水，一端却显著的亲水。当油一滴在水上的时候，水是很知趣的，尽力的拉着油酸分子中亲水的一端，同时推开了厌水的另一端。结果油酸分子就在水面上一个个地竖立起来，整齐地排列分布开，铺展成一薄层飘浮在水上，这一薄层恰好就是一个油酸分子的长度。
