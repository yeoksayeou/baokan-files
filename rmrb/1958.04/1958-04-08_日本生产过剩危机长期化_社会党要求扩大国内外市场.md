Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th - News: The Japanese Socialist Party pointed out on the 5th that, due to declining industrial production, sluggish trade, coupled with corporate bankruptcies, and an increase in unemployment, Japan's recent economic situation clearly shows a long-term production overcapacity crisis.

The Socialist Party criticized the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's tight monetary policy, pointing out that this policy was designed to reduce the losses suffered by large enterprises due to excessive investment in production equipment and the import of unsalable goods for speculative purposes. The 1958 budget also forced the working people to accept austerity policies; however, for large enterprises, this budget was a "positive budget."

In order to cope with these situations, the Socialist Party put forward its measures to overcome the economic recession. The main contents of this measure are to expand domestic and foreign markets and increase mass purchasing power.

Today's editorial in the "Mainichi Shimbun" criticized the Japanese government's tight monetary policy for increasing unemployment. According to government statistics, the number of fully unemployed people in Japan in February was 570,000, an increase of approximately 40,000 from January. The "Mainichi Shimbun" pointed out that it is even more shocking that the number of fully unemployed people in January this year had already increased by 100,000 compared to December last year.

    日本生产过剩危机长期化
    社会党要求扩大国内外市场
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本社会党5日指出，由于工业生产下降，贸易不振，再加以企业倒闭，失业人数增加等等，日本最近的经济情况明显地显示出长期生产过剩危机的现象。
    社会党批评了岸信介内阁的紧缩金融政策，指出这个政策是为了减少大企业因为在生产设备方面过多地投资和为了投机的目的而输入滞销的商品所受到的损失。1958年度预算也强迫劳动人民接受紧缩政策；但是对大企业说来，这个预算却是“积极的预算”。
    为了应付这些情况，社会党提出了它的克服经济衰退措施。这个措施的主要内容是扩大国内外市场和提高群众购买力。
    “每日新闻”今天的社论指责日本政府的紧缩金融政策使失业人数增加。据政府的统计，2月份日本完全失业的人数是五十七万人，比1月份增加了约四万人。“每日新闻”指出，更加令人吃惊的是，今年1月份的完全失业人数已经比去年12月份增加了十万人。
