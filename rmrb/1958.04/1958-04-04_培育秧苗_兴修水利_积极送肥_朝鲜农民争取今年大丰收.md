Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 2nd: As the land in northern Korea has just thawed, Korean farmers have already started agricultural activities such as cultivating seedlings, constructing water conservancy projects, and accumulating and delivering fertilizer ahead of schedule. They are determined to exert their utmost effort to produce 650,000 tons more grain than the state plan this year, bringing the total grain output to 3.5 million tons, thus approaching the goal set by the first Five-Year Plan of reaching 3.75 million tons of grain output by 1967.

    Completely innovating rice seedling cultivation technology to increase the yield of rice per chongbo (one chongbo is approximately 15 mu) from 2.9 tons last year to 3.7 tons is a resounding slogan put forward by Korean farmers in this year's increased production campaign. This year, Korean farmers have decided to promote the "cold bed seedling cultivation method" to 50% to 70% of the paddy fields in northern Korea in a leap-forward manner.

    In order to greatly increase cotton production, Korean cotton farmers have decided to use "nutritious pots" to plant cotton this year.

    In order to strive for a bumper harvest of crops this year, agricultural cooperatives have completed more than 16,000 small and medium-sized irrigation projects such as reservoirs, pumping stations, ponds, and underground canals so far. According to the plan, farmers in northern Korea will complete 30,000 small and medium-sized irrigation projects this year, which can expand the irrigated area by 60,000 chongbo.

    Due to the large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign carried out by the farmers, in addition to the application of chemical fertilizers, an average of more than 15 tons of compost can be applied per chongbo of land in northern Korea this year.

    培育秧苗　兴修水利　积极送肥
    朝鲜农民争取今年大丰收
    据新华社平壤2日电　在朝鲜北部土地刚刚解冻的时候，朝鲜农民已经提前开始了培育秧苗、兴修水利和积送肥料等农业活动。他们决心鼓足干劲，要在今年比国家计划多生产六十五万吨粮食，使粮食总产量达到三百五十万吨，从而接近第一个五年计划规定的到1967年使粮食产量达到三百七十五万吨的目标。
    全面革新水稻育苗技术使每町步（一町步约合十五市亩）水稻的产量由去年的二点九吨提高到三点七吨，是朝鲜农民在今年的增产运动中提出的响亮口号。今年，朝鲜农民决定以跃进的方式，把“冷床育苗法”推广到朝鲜北部的50％到70％的水田中。
    为了大量增产棉花，朝鲜的棉农决定在今年全部用“营养钵”来种植棉花。
    为了争取今年的农作物大丰收，到目前为止各农业社已经完成了一万六千多个水库、抽水站、池塘、暗渠等中小灌溉工程。根据计划，朝鲜北部农民在今年要完成三万个中小灌溉工程，可以扩大灌溉面积六万町步。
    由于农民们开展了大规模的积肥运动，今年朝鲜北部的每町步土地上除了施用化学肥料以外，还能平均施用十五吨以上的堆肥。
