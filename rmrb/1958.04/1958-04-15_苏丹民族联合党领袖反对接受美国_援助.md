Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 13th: The Cairo "Evening News" published a Khartoum dispatch on the 13th stating that the leader of the Sudanese National Unionist Party, Yahya Fadl, told the Sudanese "Sahara Newspaper" that the National Unionist Party opposes accepting any form of U.S. aid because no U.S. aid comes without conditions.

He said that U.S. aid serves only the interests of the United States and will open the way for U.S. imperialism to invade recipient countries. He also said that U.S. aid used to build roads is intended only to facilitate the U.S. transportation of raw materials and military equipment.

The party also issued a statement on the 9th condemning the recently signed Sudanese-American economic aid agreement as "a serious threat to Sudanese independence."

    苏丹民族联合党领袖反对接受美国“援助”
    新华社开罗13日电　开罗“晚报”刊登的13日喀土穆消息说，苏丹民族联合党领袖雅亚·法德利向苏丹“撒哈拉报”表示，民族联合党反对接受美国的各种援助，因为没有一种美国援助是不附有条件的。
    他说，美援都是为美国的利益服务，并将为美帝国主义侵入受援国家打开道路。他又说，用在修建公路的美援，其目的仅是为了便利美国运输原料和军事装备。
    这个党还在9日发表声明，谴责新近签订的苏丹—美国有关经济援助的协定“成了对苏丹独立的严重威胁”。
