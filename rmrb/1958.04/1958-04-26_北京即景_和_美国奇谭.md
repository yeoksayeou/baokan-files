"Beijing Sketches" and "American Parables"
    The Beijing People's Art Theatre's newly staged double-bill of current affairs one-act plays, "Beijing Sketches" and "American Parables," premiered yesterday.

    "Beijing Sketches" includes two one-act plays, "Spring Arrives on the Streets" (author: Zhu Lin) and "Evergreen" (authors: Feng Zi, Yan Yiyan). The former reflects the rectification movement on the streets, while the latter reflects the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir. Through moving stories and character portrayals, the authors profoundly embody the establishment of new relationships between people and the rapid growth of new ideological qualities during the socialist Great Leap Forward and the Two Antis Movement.

      "American Parables" includes three one-act plays, "Two Brothers," "April Fool's Comedy," and "Believe in America," collectively created by Chen Baichen, Mi Gu, Jiang Yousheng, and Wang Gong. The combination of satirical playwrights and cartoonists is bound to produce wonderfully intense satirical comedy. These three plays expose the corruption and decadence of American life and the inescapable doom of economic crisis from multiple angles.

    Although these are two sets of small plays with different styles, they reflect two completely different social systems, forming a sharp contrast that is thought-provoking. (Dong Qing)

    “北京即景”和“美国奇谭”
    北京人民艺术剧院新排的双反时事独幕剧“北京即景”和“美国奇谭”，已于昨日起公演。
    “北京即景”包括“春到街头”（作者朱琳），“万年长青”（作者凤子、颜一烟）两个独幕剧。前者是反映街道整风的，后者是反映十三陵水库建设的。作者通过动人的故事和人物形象，深刻地体现出社会主义大跃进和双反运动中人们之间新关系的建立，和人们新思想品质的飞快成长。
      “美国奇谭”，包括“两兄弟”、“愚人节的喜剧”和“相信美国”三个独幕剧，由陈白尘、米谷、江有生、汪巩集体创作。讽刺剧作家与漫画家的结合，讽刺喜剧性的奇妙与强烈是可想而知的。这三个剧从多方面揭露了美国生活的腐朽堕落，和无法挽救的经济危机的噩运。
    这虽是两组风格不同的小戏，却反映了两个截然不同的社会制度。形成鲜明的对比，足以使人回味。　（冬青）
