    Once Trampled, Now Respected
  　Cong Xiuzhen
    In the old society, I was a prostitute who was insulted, trampled upon, and despised. Now, I am an advanced producer at the Kuishan Weaving Factory. What a huge change! How can I not be grateful to the Party and the government?

    When I was first admitted to this factory, I was very unaccustomed to the new life. I was afraid of labor and afraid of being looked down upon. But after some time, I found that the leaders patiently educated me, and the masses warmly cared for me. No one looked down on me. I deeply felt that the old and new societies were vastly different, and I was determined to change my habit of disliking labor, work hard, and study technology diligently. I was quickly elected as the production team leader and became an advanced producer. In 1956, I was sent to Wuxi to participate in the National Textile Industry Experience Exchange Conference, which was a great encouragement to me. The encouragement and care from the leadership made me feel responsible for caring for other comrades. I regarded all the comrades in the team as my own brothers and sisters. The female worker Zhou Huijun was weak and often ill, so I brought her tea and food and comforted her in every way. The male worker Wei Lianxi was in low spirits because of producing substandard cloth, so I encouraged him and taught him the technology. As a result, four out of the five people in our team became advanced producers.

    This year, I have set a leap forward plan to exceed the output by 10% and achieve 100% quality. I am determined to complete this plan. Without the Party, I would not have everything I have now. I want to dedicate everything I have to the Party and to socialism.

    过去被蹂躏　而今受尊敬
  　从秀珍
    在旧社会我是被侮辱被蹂躏被人们鄙视的妓女，而现在我是奎山织布厂的先进生产者了。这变化是多么大呀！我怎能不感激党和政府呢？
    当我开初被收容到这个工厂时，我对新的生活很不习惯，既怕劳动，又怕别人看不起。可是过了些时候我发现领导上耐心地教育我，群众也亲切地关怀我，并没有人瞧不起我，我才深深感到新旧社会大大不同，我也就决心改变自己不爱劳动的习惯，努力生产，努力钻研技术，很快就被选为生产组长，并当了先进生产者。1956年又派我到无锡参加了全国纺织工业经验交流大会，这对我的鼓励真是太大了。领导上对我的鼓励和关怀，使我感到自己有责任也关怀别的同志。我把全组的同志都看作是自己的亲兄妹，女工周惠君体弱多病，我就给她端茶送饭，多方安慰。男工魏连喜因出次布而情绪低落，我就鼓励他，教给他技术。结果，我们组五个人就有四个先进生产者。
    今年我订了一个产量超额10％质量达到100％的跃进计划。我决心要完成这个计划。没有党就没有我现在的一切，我要把我的一切都献给党，献给社会主义。
