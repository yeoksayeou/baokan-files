Yang Liuqing, April 10th (This newspaper) - Hebei Province is currently organizing fifteen iron factories, including Tangshan Machinery Factory and Handan Farm Implement Factory, to mass-produce the ten-horsepower single-cylinder horizontal simple gasifier successfully trial-produced by Yang Liuqing Iron Factory.

The most significant features of the ten-horsepower simple gasifier are its simple structure, easy operation, and low price, making it easy to promote in rural areas. For example, the ten-horsepower high-speed gasifier is equipped with relatively complex electrical devices such as electromagnetic machines and distributors, requiring higher operating skills. Agricultural cooperative members often cannot start the machine even after learning for three or four months, and repairs are impossible in rural areas when problems arise. The simple gasifier has a very simple structure. After the gas from the gas generator is transported to the cylinder through a gas pipe, only a small charcoal stove is needed to heat the fire tube on the cylinder. The machine starts with a shake of the operating handle. Even illiterate farmers can learn to operate the machine in five or six days and can learn to install, disassemble, and repair it in ten days. The simple gasifier burns ordinary anthracite coal, and the cost is very low, while the efficiency is equivalent to that of a ten-horsepower diesel engine. The Changzheng Agricultural Cooperative of Shuigaozhuang, Jinghai County, uses a gasifier to drive a six-inch water pump to draw water from the Daqing River, which is more than two zhang deep from the ground, to irrigate paddy fields. It irrigates an average of forty mu of land per day, burning only 130 jin of coal, costing only nine fen per mu of land for fuel, which is only one-seventh of the cost of a ten-horsepower diesel engine. The simple gasifier can also drive more than ten kinds of machinery used for agricultural production and crop processing, such as rice threshing, corn shelling, grass cutting, slicing, rice milling, flour milling, and small generators.

The ten-horsepower simple gasifier, except for the hooks, crankshaft, and some small parts made of domestic forged steel and small round steel, is made of pig iron. The gas generator is also made of adobe or green bricks. Therefore, in the current situation of insufficient supply of high-quality steel, it can also be produced in large quantities. (Fang Chen)

    简易煤气机又贱又方便
    本报杨柳青10日电　目前河北省正组织唐山机器厂、邯郸农具厂等十五个铁工厂大量生产杨柳青铁工厂试制成功的十马力单缸卧式简易煤气机。
    十马力简易煤气机最大的特点是构造简单，操作方便，价钱便宜，农村里容易推广。例如十马力高速煤气机装有比较复杂的电磁机、分火心等电气装置，需要较高的操作技术，农业社社员常常学三、四个月还开不动机器，出了毛病在农村也无法修理。简易煤气机构造很简单，煤气发生炉的煤气通过输气管输送到汽缸后，只用一个小木炭炉把汽缸上的火管烤热，一摇操作把机器就开动起来了，即便是不识字的农民，学习五、六天便能开机器，十多天时间就能学会安装、拆卸和修理。简易煤气机烧普通无烟煤，费用很低，而效率和十马力的柴油机相等。静海县水高庄长征农业社，用一台煤气机带动一台六吋水泵，从离地面两丈多深的大清河里抽水浇稻田，平均每天浇四十亩地，只烧一百三十斤煤，每亩地只花九分钱的燃料费，只有十马力的柴油机的费用的七分之一。简易煤气机还可以带动打稻、玉米脱粒、铡草、切片、碾米磨面、小型发电机等十多种农业生产和农作物加工用的机械。
    十马力简易煤气机，除了勾臂、曲轴和一些小零件是用国产锻钢、小型元钢制造以外，其余都用生铁制造。煤气发生炉也是用土坯或青砖制造的。因此，在目前优质钢材供应不足的情况下，也可以大量生产。　（方辰）
