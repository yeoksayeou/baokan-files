    Giving One's Heart to the Masses and Integrating with Them

    I originally worked in a factory office, and last November I was transferred to the workshop to work as a lathe operator.

    At that time, I took on the labor post with an incorrect idea. I thought that the Party required cadres to go down to the grassroots for labor training, and that I would be well-trained as long as I worked in the workshop for a year or two. Furthermore, I have a certain level of education, so after arriving at the workshop, as long as I wholeheartedly learn the technology, after a period of time, I will become an all-round talent with both culture and technology. This not only meets the Party's requirement of being both red and expert, but also allows me to learn a skill for myself.

    According to this "purpose," I began my labor life. Like Comrade Yu Zhiming, even though I was initially unaccustomed to following the shifts (early, middle, and late shifts), and standing for eight hours a shift even made my ankles swell, I didn't utter a single complaint. At that time, apart from participating in the rotation and the workshop's production meetings, I didn't participate in any other activities. Whenever I had free time, I would stay at home and read books (technical books) and didn't interact with anyone. However, before long, I encountered great distress. I began to discover that the female workers were distancing themselves from me and looking at me differently. The deputy foreman also had opinions about me. Originally, they had high hopes for me being transferred to their workshop. The comrades in their workshop were not highly educated, and in the past, whenever there was a meeting, they worried about no one taking notes; the guaranteed conditions agreed upon couldn't be written down on paper. Since the Great Leap Forward, everyone has been challenging and responding to challenges, but if they wanted to write a challenge or response, they had to ask the team leader for help. So when I first arrived, the deputy foreman enthusiastically said to everyone: "Our workshop has a cultured older sister, so we won't have to ask for help with writing and arithmetic in the future." As a result, my approach dampened their enthusiasm. I didn't fulfill their wishes, but instead created some trouble for them. Naturally, this made them dissatisfied and distant from me.

    I realized that only by giving my heart to the masses, integrating with them, and completely becoming a member of the masses, is it possible to accept the thoughts of the workers and peasants and gradually transform myself into a working-class intellectual. That kind of "gilding" training method is unacceptable.

    把心交给群众　和群众打成一片
    我原在工厂科室里工作，去年11月份下放到车间当值车工。
    那时，我是带着一种不正确的想法走上劳动岗位的。我想党要求干部下放劳动锻炼，只要能在车间干上一年两年，就会锻炼得好的。再说，我有一定的文化程度，到车间后，只要一心一意学技术，过上一个时期，就会成为一个有文化有技术的文武全才。既符合党的又红又专的要求，对自己来说又学得了一技之长。
    按照这个“宗旨”，开始了我的劳动生活。像余志明同志那样，尽管起初跟班（早、中、晚三班）不习惯，站一个班八小时，甚至联脚都站肿了，我也没说过一句怨言。那时我除了参加轮班和工区的生产会议外，什么活动也不参加，一有空就守在家里看书（技术书），不和大家往来。可是，为时不长，我却碰上了很大的苦恼。我开始发现女工姐妹们都疏远我，对我另眼相看。副工长对我也有意见，原来她们对我下放到她们工区里是抱着很大希望的，她们工区里的同志，文化都不高，过去一开会，都发愁没人作记录；订好的保证条件也不会写在纸上。大跃进以来，大家都在互相挑战，应战，可是她们想写个挑战、应战书，还得找班干部帮忙。所以当我刚来时，副工长就热情地对大家说：“咱们工区来了个有文化的大姐，往后写写算算就不求人了”。结果我的作法却使她们冷了半截，我没有满足她们的愿望，却给她们增加了一些麻烦。这自然使她们不满意，和我疏远。
    我体会到只有把自己的心交给群众，和群众打成一片，彻底变成群众中的一分子，才有可能接受工农群众的思想，使自己逐渐变成一个工人阶级的知识分子。那种“镀金”式的锻炼方法是要不得的。
