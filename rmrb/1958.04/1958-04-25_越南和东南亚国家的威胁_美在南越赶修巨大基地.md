    Threat to Vietnam and Southeast Asian Countries
    US Hastily Builds Huge Base in South Vietnam
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 23rd: The Vietnam News Agency reported on April 23rd that the latest issue of "Thong Nhat" (Unification) newspaper revealed that the Saigon-Bien Hoa highway, which is being rapidly constructed in South Vietnam, is actually a huge, modern airport for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) aggressive bloc.
    According to reports, a map of the highway published in a Saigon newspaper, along with Ngo Dinh Diem's order issued on August 9, 1957, shows that the highway is more than thirty kilometers long and one hundred meters wide, with a nine hundred and fifty meter wide no-man's land on each side, bringing the total width of the highway to two kilometers. A South Vietnamese source revealed that the highway connects Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Airport and Bien Hoa Airport, both of which are among the largest airports in Southeast Asia. The South Vietnamese source openly admitted that the highway is constructed of reinforced concrete and can be used as an airstrip when necessary. It also has underground trenches.
    "Thong Nhat" newspaper said that this is part of a series of aggressive bases used by the US to encircle socialist countries. At the same time, aircraft taking off from here not only threaten Vietnam, but may also threaten Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries.
    The road construction project is reportedly being carried out by two American companies - "Capital Machine Company" and "Johnson, Drake and Piper." The cost is being paid from "US aid," totaling 650 million South Vietnamese dong, which is more than five times South Vietnam's 1958 budget for the Ministry of Economy and more than twenty-three times the budget for the Ministry of Labor.

    越南和东南亚国家的威胁
    美在南越赶修巨大基地
    新华社河内23日电　据越南通讯社23日报道，最近一期的“统一报”揭露，正在南越加紧修建中的西贡—边和公路实际是东南亚条约组织侵略集团的一个巨大的现代化机场。
    据报道，从一家西贡报纸所刊载的关于这条公路的地图和吴庭艳在1957年8月9日发出的命令看到，这条公路有三十多公里长，一百公尺宽，公路的两旁各有九百五十公尺宽的无人地带，这样，公路的总宽度就达到两公里。一个南越人士透露，这条公路连接西贡的新山一机场和边和的机场，这两个机场都在东南亚最大的机场之列。这个南越人士公开承认，这条公路是用加强的混凝土修建的，在必要时可以用作飞机跑道。它还附有地下壕堑。
    “统一报”说，这是美国包围社会主义阵营国家的一系列侵略基地的一环。同时，从这里起飞的飞机不仅威胁越南，也可能威胁到印度尼西亚以及其它东南亚国家。
    据报道，筑路工程是由两家美国公司——“卡皮特耳机器公司”和“约翰逊·德雷克和派珀尔公司”进行的。费用是从“美援”项下拨支，共达南越币六亿五千万元，等于南越1958年度经济部预算的五倍多，劳动部预算的二十三倍。
