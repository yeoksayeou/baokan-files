    On Newspapers Around the Country
    Youth Experimental Fields
    At the Shaanxi Province Youth High-Yield Experimental Field Experience Exchange Conference, eight hundred representatives proposed to the rural youth of the province that in 1958, one million mu of experimental fields and large-area high-yield fields should be established. One million mu accounts for only 1.5% of the province's cultivated land area, but the output should reach 1 billion jin, which is 9% of the province's total output last year. The Shaanxi Daily published this news on March 28th as a front-page headline, and also published an editorial. The editorial stated that youth experimental fields are a base for promoting and developing high-yield experience and science and technology, a battlefield for young people to use their "martial arts" and "wisdom" to create extraordinary achievements, and a good form of communist education for young people.
    Guizhou's Speed
    Guizhou Province, like other provinces, is accelerating its pace in developing local industries. A noteworthy set of figures was included in the local industry column on the first page of the Guizhou Daily on the 26th: From March 1st to 15th, in just half a month, another 233 factories and mines in the province were put into production, accounting for 63% of the total in January and February, with an average of 15 and a half factories put into production every day; the construction speed was more than doubled compared to the previous two months. In the Zunyi area alone, more than 5,000 small factories and mines of agricultural cooperatives have been put into production.
    Realized "Full Fertilizer County"
    Increasing fertilizer application is a key measure for increasing agricultural production. As of March 25th, Boli County, located in the northeast corner of Heilongjiang Province, had accumulated more than 2,504,000 cubic meters of manure and delivered 2,480,000 cubic meters to the fields (only 680,000 cubic meters were applied last year). All 90,000 hectares of cultivated land in the county have been completely fertilized. The amount of fertilizer applied per hectare is generally 50,000 jin, and in some cases as much as 80,000 to 100,000 jin, reaching or exceeding the provincial standard requirements. This broke the county's long-standing tradition of applying little fertilizer and realized a "full fertilizer county". The Heilongjiang Daily published this news on the first page on the 28th.

    青年试验田
    陕西省青年丰产试验田经验交流大会上，八百名代表向全省农村青年倡议，1958年要建立一百万亩试验田和大面积丰产田。一百万亩仅占全省耕地面积1.5％，但产量要达到十亿斤，即去年全省总产量的9％。陕西日报在3月28日以头条地位刊登了这条新闻，同时发表了社论，社论中提出青年试验田是推广、发展丰产经验和科学技术的基地，是青年用“武”用“智”创造奇功的战场，是向青年进行共产主义教育的一种良好形式。
    贵州的速度
    贵州省同其他省份一样，在发展地方工业方面正在加快速度前进。26日贵州日报一版报道地方工业的专栏里有一个引人注意的数字资料：从3月1日到15日半个月中，全省又有二百三十三个厂矿投入生产，占1、2月份总数的63％，平均每天有十五个半厂投入生产；建设速度比前两个月加快了一倍多。光遵义专区就已有五千多个农业社的小厂矿投入生产。
    实现了“满肥县”
    增施肥料是农业增产的一个关键性措施。截至3月25日，地处黑龙江省东北角上的勃利县，共积出粪肥二百五十万四千多立方公尺，送到地里二百四十八万立方公尺（去年只上六十八万立方公尺），全县九万公顷耕地都已全部施肥。每公顷施肥量一般为五万斤，多的到八万至十万斤，达到或超过省的要求标准。这就打破了这个县历来施肥不多的陈规旧习，实现了“满肥县”。28日黑龙江日报在一版刊登了这个消息。
