Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: The General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the State Archives Bureau separately convened archival work conferences for the Party and state organs of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions from April 6th to 16th. Both conferences pointed out that archival work must serve socialist revolution and socialist construction. The current guiding principle for archival work should be to take the rapid, efficient, and economical development of archival material utilization as the guiding principle, driving the collection, sorting, and preservation of archival materials, and achieving a great leap forward in archival work.

The situation at these two conferences shows that, in the comprehensive great leap forward of socialism, archival departments have broken with convention and vigorously carried out the sorting and utilization of archival materials. The Archives Section of the Ministry of Finance, with the support of its leadership and the assistance of the Communist Youth League members of various business units of the ministry, worked hard for thirty days and sorted out more than 15,000 volumes of archival materials accumulated in the ministry. The Civil Affairs Department of Liaoning Province, with the active participation of all staff members, worked hard for a month and sorted out the accumulated archival materials of the department. Many archival departments have found a large number of archival materials to serve the current political struggle and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural construction. For example, the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee made full use of historical archival materials in the struggle against the Li Shinong anti-Party clique, effectively exposing the political features of the anti-Party elements; the Archives Section of the Ministry of Supervision held an exhibition of Wang Han's crimes using archival materials, powerfully exposing the anti-Party and anti-socialist features of this rightist element; the staff of the Henan Provincial Department of Commerce used archival materials to write more than 15,000 big-character posters during the anti-waste upsurge, exposing huge waste facts totaling approximately 55 million yuan.

The two conferences pointed out: Archival departments should establish close contact with scientific research institutions and provide archival materials according to the needs of the research institutions. The Ming and Qing Archives established contacts with several scientific research institutions and regularly provided archival materials according to their needs. For example, they assisted the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research in copying and excerpting archival materials related to rivers, rainfall, drought, and flood in various parts of the country during the Qing Dynasty for two hundred years, which was very useful for water conservancy scientific research.

In order to facilitate various organs to obtain the technical archival materials they need, after consultation with relevant organs, the conference tentatively decided to establish several information centers for archival materials in the central government, responsible for the exchange of technical archival materials. Some provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are also beginning to do such work.

The conference believed that archival departments in various localities should pay attention to assisting district and township organs and grassroots industrial and agricultural production organizations in sorting out and properly preserving archival materials. The Hebei Provincial Archives Department helped the Cuiping Mountain Agricultural Cooperative in Ji County to sort out archival materials since the establishment of the cooperative. The leading cadres of this agricultural cooperative often used these archival materials to plan production. This example attracted the attention of all attendees.

The conference pointed out: To achieve a great leap forward in archival work, it is necessary to eliminate the conservative thinking and purely professional viewpoints of archival departments. At present, the main manifestations of conservative thinking in archival departments are: being bound by book theories, not proceeding from reality, doctrinairism that does not attach importance to summarizing practical experience, and empiricism that adheres to conventions and does not pay attention to learning advanced experience and advanced theories. The manifestation of a purely professional viewpoint is the lack of a clear service ideology and mass viewpoint in the work. Burying oneself in professional technology, without paying attention to the needs of the country's current political struggle and the socialist great leap forward for archival materials; following the established procedures in work, failing to give timely play to the role of archival materials, resulting in archival work losing its direction and being divorced from the needs of the masses. The conference believed that archivists must clearly resolve the relationship between business and politics, red and expert, theory and practice, and establish a rapid, efficient, and economical service viewpoint.

Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council, gave instructions to these two meetings. He pointed out: To achieve a great leap forward in archival work, it is necessary to first liberate thinking, and first have a great leap forward in thinking; at the same time, it is necessary to rely on the Party and rely on the masses to clarify the viewpoint of serving all kinds of work. He proposed that archival work is a mass-based work, and only by having the whole Party and all levels of organs doing archival work can the archival work be done well.

    让档案工作为社会主义服务
    中共中央办公厅和国家档案局召开全国档案工作会议
    据新华社27日讯　中共中央办公厅和国家档案局在4月6日至16日分别召开了各省、市、自治区党的和国家机关的档案工作会议。这两个会议都指出，档案工作必须为社会主义革命和社会主义建设服务，当前档案工作的方针应当以多快好省地开展对档案资料的利用工作为纲，带动档案资料的收集、整理、保管等工作，实现档案工作大跃进。
    这两个会议的情况表明，在社会主义的全面大跃进中，档案工作部门已经突破常规，大力开展了档案资料的整理和利用工作。财政部档案科在领导支持和这个部各业务单位共青团员的支援下，苦战三十天，整理了部里积存的一万五千多卷档案资料。辽宁省民政厅在全厅工作人员的积极参加下，大干一个月，整理了这个厅积存的档案资料。许多档案部门查找出大批档案资料，为当前的政治斗争和工农业建设的大跃进服务。例如中共安徽省委在反对李世农反党集团的斗争中，充分地利用了历史档案资料，有力地揭露了反党分子的政治面目；监察部档案科利用档案资料举办了原监察部副部长王翰的罪证展览会，有力地揭露了这个右派分子的反党反社会主义面目；河南省商业厅的工作人员在反浪费高潮中利用档案资料写了一万五千多张大字报，揭发出约计五千五百多万元的巨大浪费事实。
    这两个会议指出：档案部门应该和科学研究机关取得密切联系，根据研究机关的需要提供档案资料。明清档案馆和几个科学研究机关建立了联系，经常根据他们的需要，提供档案资料，例如协助中国水利科学研究院抄摘了清朝二百年间有关全国各地河流、雨量、旱涝等档案资料，对水利科学研究工作很有用处。
    为了便利各机关得到所需要的技术档案资料，经过和有关机关协商，会议初步确定了要在中央建立若干个档案资料的情报中心，负责技术档案资料的交流工作。有的省、市、自治区也在开始做这样的工作。
    会议认为各地档案部门应当注意协助区乡机关和工农业基层生产组织整理和保管好档案资料。河北省档案部门帮助蓟县翠屏山农业合作社整理了整社建社以来的档案资料，这个农业社的领导干部经常利用这些档案资料来规划生产。这个榜样，引起了全体到会人员的注意。
    会议指出：要实现档案工作的大跃进，必须清除档案部门的保守思想和单纯业务观点。目前档案部门的保守思想的主要表现是：束缚于书本理论，不从实际出发，不重视总结实际经验的教条主义和墨守陈规、不注意学习先进经验、先进理论的经验主义。单纯业务观点的表现就是工作中缺乏明确的服务思想和群众观点。埋头于业务技术，而不注意国家当前的政治斗争和社会主义大跃进对于档案资料的需要，工作中按部就班，不能及时发挥档案资料的作用，结果使档案工作迷失方向，脱离群众的需要。会议认为档案人员必须明确地解决业务和政治、红与专的关系，理论和实践的关系，树立多快好省的服务观点。
    国务院秘书长习仲勋曾对这两个会议作了指示。他指出：实现档案工作大跃进一定要先解放思想，先来个思想大跃进；同时要依靠党依靠群众，明确为各项工作服务的观点。他提出档案工作是带有群众性的工作，必须全党办档案工作，各级机关做档案工作，才能把档案工作做好。
