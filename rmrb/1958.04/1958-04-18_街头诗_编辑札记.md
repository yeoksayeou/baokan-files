	"Street Poetry" Editorial Notes
	Wang Jie
	A month and a half ago, we posted a street poem on the outside wall of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles building. Many people encouraged us. So, street poetry began to be posted weekly. Six issues have now been published.
	The format is small, only two double-sided newspapers, handwritten with a brush, each issue only publishing five or six short poems. Many poets cherish this small garden. In the six issues, works by nearly twenty comrades, including Zang Kejia and Yuan Shuipai, have been published. From the fifth issue, we have received cooperation from artists like Mi Gu, and we have lively illustrations.
	We regard street poetry as a kind of "experimental field" for changing poetic style and making poetry easier to connect with the masses. A month and a half is not a long time, but this small "experimental field" has provided us with quite valuable experience.
	I would like to start by saying a bit about an interesting feeling. When we write poems and copy them on manuscripts, or print them in publications and newspapers, we are used to it after so many years; but when we write walnut-sized characters on white paper with a brush and paste them on the wall, the feeling is different; some poems, the masses can recite fluently and happily, some poems, the masses recite one or two lines, and then stop.
	Sometimes, we also directly ask some regular readers - tricycle workers. We think some poems are more poetic and interesting, but they don't like them; while we think some poems are "mediocre," they like them very much. It can be seen that there is indeed a distance between us.
	But since street poetry is directly taken to the masses, we must strive to be liked by the majority. To achieve this, the first thing to consider is the issue of expression methods. Not every expression method is familiar to the readers of street poetry. If we study the general expression methods of folk songs, ditties, and clappers, it will be easy to understand. We must respect their habits, and through this path, enable them to accept it, and only on this basis can we talk about improving their appreciation. Otherwise, we will be divorced from the masses. The several poems we published that were more popular with the masses were not roundabout in terms of expression; they were not the kind that you read halfway and still don't know the central idea.
	Secondly, it must be easy to recite. This is related to language, and also related to form. The language must of course be popular, be good at using wonderful spoken language, and write short sentences. In terms of form, pay attention to the habits of the masses. We also intentionally publish works in various forms. But clear rhythm is very important.
	The subject matter is also very important. Because street poetry is posted in different places, the selection of materials should be different. Major events at home and abroad should be written about, but important events in the lives of the local people at the time must not be ignored. In this way, street poetry can fully play its mobilizing and fighting role; it can better serve socialism.
	It should not be thought that the masses only like rigid and boring narratives. Street poetry should also have fantasy. For example, there is a poem called "Planting Castor Beans," and one tricycle worker said that he liked it the most. This poem not only concisely writes that planting castor beans is a good thing, but also, the author also writes through fantasy that the castor beans are harvested abundantly and sent to the state's purchasing station, and the people who plant castor beans are praised by the purchasing station. Poetry cannot be separated from fantasy, and the masses also need poems with fantasy.
	With the great leap forward of socialist culture, the issue of changing poetic style has been raised. We want to use this "experimental field" to try to create national forms that are loved by the people on the basis of Chinese classical poetry and folk songs.

    “街头诗”编辑札记
    王洁
    一个半月以前，我们把一张街头诗贴在文联大楼的门外墙上。许多人鼓舞我们。街头诗就每周一次地贴出去了。现在已出了六期。
    篇幅不大，只有两张对开报纸，用毛笔抄写，每一期只能发表五六首短诗。许多诗人都爱护这一块小小的园地。六期中，先后发表了臧克家、袁水拍等近二十位同志的作品；从第五期开始，得到了画家米谷等同志的合作，有了生动的插画。
    我们把街头诗作为改变诗风，使诗歌更容易与群众结合的一种“试验田”。一个半月的时间不算长，这小块“试验田”却给我们提供了颇为值得重视的经验。
    我想先说一点有趣的感觉。我们写的诗，抄在稿子上，或印在刊物、报纸上，因多年的习惯，视之泰然；可是，当用毛笔把核桃般大的字写在白纸上，贴在墙上，感觉就不同了；有的诗，群众念得上口，念得愉快，有的诗，群众念一两句，就不念了。
    有时，我们也直接去问几位经常的读者——三轮车工人，我们认为比较有诗意，有情趣的诗，他们不喜欢；而我们认为“平平之作”，他们却很喜爱。可以看出，这中间确有一段距离。
    但街头诗既然是直接拿到群众中去，必须力争得到多数人的喜爱。要作到这一点，首先要考虑的是表现方法的问题。不是任何表现方法都是街头诗的读者所习惯的。如果我们研究一下民歌、小调、快板的一般的表现方法就容易理解了。要尊重他们的习惯，通过这条道路使他们能接受，在这个基础上才能谈到提高他们的欣赏力。否则，就会脱离群众。我们发表的几首比较为群众喜爱的诗，从表现方法上来看，都不是转弯抹角的；都不是看了一半还不知道中心意思的。
    其次，要能上口。这与语言有关，与形式也有关。语言当然要通俗，要善于运用精彩的口语，要写短句。形式上要注意群众的习惯。我们也有意地发表各种形式的作品。但节奏鲜明却很重要。
    题材也很有关系。街头诗由于贴的地方不一样，在取材上应有所不同。国内外的大事应该写，但当时当地的人民生活中的重大事情也切不可忽略。这样，街头诗才能充分发挥鼓动性，战斗性；才能很好为社会主义服务。
    不能认为群众只喜欢死死板板的纪事文。街头诗同样要有幻想。如有一首“种蓖麻”，一位三轮工人说，他最喜欢。这首诗不仅比较精炼地写了种蓖麻是件好事情，而且，作者还通过幻想写出了蓖麻丰收，送到了国家的收购站，种蓖麻的人受到收购站的表扬。诗离不开幻想，而群众也需要有幻想的诗。
    随着社会主义文化的大跃进，改变诗风的问题提出来了。我们想利用这块“试验田”，在中国古典诗歌及民歌的基础上，尝试着创造人民群众喜闻乐见的民族形式。
