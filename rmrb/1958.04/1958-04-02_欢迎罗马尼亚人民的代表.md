    Welcome the Representatives of the Romanian People
    The Romanian government delegation, headed by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, Chivu Stoica, is coming to our country for a friendly visit after visiting India, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Burma. Their visit to our country is a sign of the further growth of the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people and will make a new and important contribution to the cause of unity among socialist countries and world peace. The Chinese people extend a warm welcome to their arrival with brotherly feelings.
    The Chinese and Romanian people are close brothers. Our two peoples share common ideals and are actively working to build socialism. The distinguished Romanian guests will see the great leap forward of socialism in our country. Our people are also very concerned about the socialist construction of the Romanian people. We are very pleased to see that in the more than thirteen years since liberation, the hardworking and brave Romanian people, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, have made brilliant achievements in socialist construction. Today, Romania has long changed its economically backward state before liberation and has become a country with advanced socialist industry. After the Romanian people victoriously completed the first five-year plan, its total industrial output nearly tripled that of the pre-war year of 1938. Many new industrial sectors have been established, especially the petroleum industry and the machine-building industry have seen significant development. The ten-year electrification plan has rapidly developed Romania's electricity industry. In the first two years of implementing the new five-year plan, Romania's industry has further grown. Romania's agriculture has also greatly improved since liberation. In 1957, Romania's crop harvest reached the highest level in forty years. In recent years, Romania's agricultural cooperation movement has been developing rapidly. By the end of 1957, the number of peasant households participating in various agricultural cooperative organizations accounted for 42% of the total number of peasants in the country, and the socialist sector of agriculture accounted for 51% of the country's agricultural land area. The development of Romania's industry and agriculture has greatly improved the people's material and cultural living standards.
    The Romanian People's Republic has consistently pursued a policy of peace and friendship with all countries. Together with all peace-loving countries, it has made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace. Romania is determined to work for the establishment of a European collective security system, firmly supports the struggle of Asian and African countries against colonialism and for the attainment and consolidation of national independence, and has established and developed economic and cultural ties with these countries. Recently, the Romanian government delegation visited India and Burma, further strengthening friendly relations with these two countries. This kind of friendly exchanges is conducive to the cause of world peace and cooperation among countries, and once again proves the possibility of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.
    Romania is an important member of the socialist camp. In recent years, the Romanian people, together with the people of all socialist countries, have made significant efforts to strengthen the unity among socialist countries. During the Hungarian October Incident, the Romanian people firmly supported the Hungarian people's struggle to defend the socialist system. Later, Romania held talks with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries and signed bilateral and multilateral agreements to further consolidate and develop mutual friendly and cooperative relations. Last year, during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the delegation of the Romanian Party attended the meeting of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries in Moscow and jointly signed the famous declaration. All of these are of great significance for strengthening the unity of socialist countries. The Romanian delegation's visit to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strengthened the friendship between the Romanian and Vietnamese peoples. After visiting our country, the Romanian government delegation will also visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Mongolian People's Republic, two fraternal countries. This visit of the Romanian government delegation to Asian fraternal countries will undoubtedly further strengthen mutual understanding and be conducive to the unity among socialist countries.
    At the moment when the Romanian government delegation comes to our country for a visit, we are particularly excited that the political, economic, and cultural relations between our two countries are constantly developing and consolidating. The Romanian People's Republic has provided great assistance to our country in supplying agricultural machinery, power station equipment, petroleum products, and petroleum industrial equipment, and in sending experts to impart advanced experience. This is of great significance for the rapid development of our country's socialist construction. Through the Sino-Romanian Cultural Cooperation Agreement and other agreements, cooperation between China and Romania in culture and science has also made great achievements. When the Romanian Workers' Party held its Second National Congress, the Chinese Communist Party delegation headed by Comrade Zhu De went to congratulate it; when the Chinese Communist Party held its Eighth National Congress, the Romanian Workers' Party delegation headed by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej also visited our country. These are major events in the development of friendly relations between China and Romania. This brotherly friendly and cooperative relationship between our two peoples vividly embodies the deep friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples and the great unity among socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.
    Today, when our distinguished Romanian guests come to visit our country, it is also the time when our people are making a great leap forward towards socialism. The rapid development of our country's socialist construction is inseparable from the brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union, Romania, and other socialist countries. Our people sincerely thank the Romanian people for their assistance to our country. Our people will, together with the Romanian people, continue to work hard to strengthen the friendly relations between China and Romania, to strengthen the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and to safeguard world peace.

    欢迎罗马尼亚人民的代表
    以罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡为首的罗马尼亚政府代表团，在访问了印度、越南民主共和国和缅甸之后，前来我国进行友好访问，今天将抵达首都北京。他们来我国访问，是中罗两国人民之间的兄弟友谊进一步增长的标志，也会对社会主义国家之间的团结和世界和平的事业作出新的重要贡献。中国人民抱着兄弟般的感情，对他们的到来表示热烈欢迎。
    中罗两国人民是亲密的兄弟。我们两国人民有着共同的美好理想，都在积极努力建设社会主义。罗马尼亚贵宾们将在我国看到社会主义大跃进。我国人民也非常关怀罗马尼亚人民的社会主义建设。我们十分欣慰地看到，在解放以来的十三年多的时间里，勤劳勇敢的罗马尼亚人民，在罗马尼亚工人党的领导之下，在社会主义建设中取得了光辉的成就。今天，罗马尼亚早已改变了解放前的经济落后的状态，成为拥有先进的社会主义工业的国家了。罗马尼亚人民在胜利完成了第一个五年计划之后，它的工业总产量差不多比战前1938年增加了两倍。它的许多新的工业部门建立起来了，特别是石油工业和机器制造工业有了显著的发展。十年电气化计划使罗马尼亚的电力工业迅速发展。在执行新的五年计划的头两年中，罗马尼亚的工业又有进一步的增长。罗马尼亚的农业在解放后也有很大的提高。1957年罗马尼亚农作物的收获量达到四十年来的最高水平。近年来，罗马尼亚农业合作化运动正在迅速地发展。到1957年年底为止，参加各种农业合作组织的农户已占全国农民总数的42％，农业社会主义部分已占全国农业用地面积的51％。罗马尼亚工农业的发展，已使人民的物质和文化生活水平大大提高。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国一贯执行着和平和同各国友好的政策。它同爱好和平的各国一起，为缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平事业进行了不懈的斗争。罗马尼亚坚决为建立欧洲集体安全体系而努力，坚决支持亚非国家反对殖民主义、争取和巩固民族独立的斗争，并且同这些国家建立和发展了经济和文化联系。最近，罗马尼亚政府代表团访问了印度和缅甸，进一步加强了同这两个国家的友好关系。这种友好往来，有利于世界和平和各国合作的事业，并再一次证明了不同社会制度国家和平共处的可能性。
    罗马尼亚是社会主义阵营中重要的一员。近年来，罗马尼亚人民同社会主义各国人民一起，为加强社会主义国家之间的团结进行了重大的努力。在匈牙利十月事件中，罗马尼亚人民坚决支持了匈牙利人民捍卫社会主义制度的斗争。以后罗马尼亚又同苏联和其他社会主义国家进行了会谈，签订了双边和多边协定，进一步巩固和发展了相互的友好互助关系。在去年庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，罗马尼亚党的代表团出席了社会主义国家共产党和工人党在莫斯科举行的会议，并共同签署了著名的宣言。所有这些，对于加强社会主义国家的团结都有重大的意义。这次罗马尼亚代表团访问越南民主共和国，加强了罗越两国人民的友谊。在访问了我国以后，罗马尼亚政府代表团还要到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国两个兄弟国家去进行访问。这次罗马尼亚政府代表团到亚洲兄弟国家进行访问，无疑地，将进一步加强相互间的了解，有利于社会主义国家之间的团结。
    当罗马尼亚政府代表团来到我国访问的时刻，我们特别感到兴奋的是，我们两国的政治、经济和文化关系正在不断地发展和巩固。罗马尼亚人民共和国在供应我国农业机器、电站设备、石油产品和石油工业设备方面，在派遣专家传授先进经验方面，都给予了我国很大的帮助。这对于我国社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，有着十分重大的意义。通过中罗文化合作协定和其他协定，中罗两国在文化和科学等方面的合作，也取得了很大的成绩。在罗马尼亚工人党举行第二次全国代表大会的时候，以朱德同志为首的中国共产党代表团曾前往祝贺；在中国共产党举行第八次全国代表大会的时候，以乔治乌—德治同志为首的罗马尼亚工人党代表团也访问了我国。这是中罗两国友好关系发展中的重大事件。我们两国人民这种兄弟般的友好合作关系，生动地体现了中罗两国人民的深厚友谊和以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的伟大团结。
    今天，当我们的罗马尼亚贵宾们来到我国访问的时候，也正是我国人民向社会主义大跃进的时候。我国社会主义建设的突飞猛进，是同苏联、罗马尼亚以及其他社会主义国家的兄弟般的援助分不开的。我国人民衷心地感谢罗马尼亚人民给予我国的援助。我国人民将同罗马尼亚人民一起，继续为加强中罗两国友好关系，为加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的伟大团结，为维护世界和平而共同奋斗。
