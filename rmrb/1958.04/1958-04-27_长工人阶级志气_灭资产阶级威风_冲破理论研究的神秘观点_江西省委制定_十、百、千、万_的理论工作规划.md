    Foster the Ambition of the Working Class, Destroy the Prestige of the Bourgeoisie
    Break Through the Mystical Views of Theoretical Research
    Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Formulates a "Ten, Hundred, Thousand, Ten Thousand" Theoretical Work Plan
    The plan requires that in 1958, ten experiences in carrying out theoretical work be summarized, more than one hundred articles with high theoretical levels be created, more than one thousand articles publicizing Marxism-Leninism and addressing practical problems be written, and the organization and training of tens of thousands of part-time and full-time theoretical workers be started.
    Nanchang, April 26 (Reporter Li Jiuzhe) - The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee recently held an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee to study the issue of strengthening theoretical work, calling on cadres throughout the province to break superstitions, liberate their minds, boldly create, and boldly research; to dare to speak, dare to think, and dare to write. In theoretical and academic work, it is necessary to foster the ambition of the working class, destroy the prestige of the bourgeoisie, and oppose the bourgeois viewpoint of mystifying theory and academics, treating them as unattainable and unrelated to the working people. In this spirit, the meeting formulated a theoretical work plan, which requires that in 1958, ten experiences in carrying out theoretical work be summarized, more than one hundred articles with high theoretical levels be created, more than one thousand articles publicizing Marxism-Leninism and addressing practical problems be written, and the organization and training of tens of thousands of part-time and full-time theoretical workers be started. The meeting summarized this plan as the "Ten, Hundred, Thousand, Ten Thousand" theoretical work plan.
    The meeting determined that the main content of the Party's theoretical work in a fairly long period to come should be the publicity and implementation of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the Party's general line for socialist construction, and that the slogans of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, valuing the present over the past, learning while doing, being both red and expert, and being deeply rooted in expertise through being red, should be the guidelines and methods of the Party's theoretical work.
    The meeting discussed in detail the summarization of economic experiences in socialist construction, the cultivation of a theoretical team that is both red and expert, and the establishment of theoretical publications.
    In order to promote Jiangxi's socialist construction cause in a faster, better, and more economical way and to better implement the central government's line, principles, and policies, the meeting believed that summarizing the various experiences of socialist construction in the province is an important task of the Party's theoretical work. To this end, the meeting decided that the Party committees at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, as well as industrial and mining enterprises equivalent to the county level, should establish Party writing groups under the direct leadership of the Party committees, as the backbone force for summarizing socialist construction experiences and carrying out theoretical work. The members of the writing groups should be mainly composed of Party committee members and backbones from all aspects, and the group leaders should be the first secretaries of the Party committees or the main responsible persons of the organs. In 1958, 238 such Party writing groups will be organized in the province, with 2,602 members. Each member of the writing group is required to write at least three articles this year, totaling 7,806 articles, of which 100 are required to have a higher theoretical level. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, the meeting required that in May of this year, through bottom-up and top-down methods, one thousand thesis topics be proposed, and that five determinations (determine the topic, determine the person, determine the time, determine the quality, and determine the quantity) be made before June. The writing methods should be diversified, and methods such as collective writing, individual writing, and cooperation between comrades engaged in practical work and full-time theoretical workers can be adopted. The meeting required that with the Party's writing groups throughout the province as the core, one hundred social science works and two thousand popular pamphlets publicizing Marxism-Leninism should be written within five years, and the compilation of Jiangxi local chronicles and county chronicles should begin this year.
    The meeting believed that to do a good job in theoretical work, it is necessary to cultivate a Party's theoretical team that is both red and expert. After discussion, the meeting decided that from this year, a theoretical propaganda team of about 15,000 people should be established and cultivated within five years.
    The meeting required that the province cultivate 470 various talents with high theoretical levels within five years. The meeting decided to establish eight provincial-level societies such as philosophy, political economy, and law in the first half of this year, and to create Jiangxi Province's theoretical journal "Jiangxi Academic Journal." The meeting also discussed issues such as cadre rotation training and on-the-job cadre learning.
    The Enlarged Meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee required that the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, according to the arrangements made some time ago, strive to formulate theoretical work plans in April of this year. The Enlarged Meeting of the Provincial Party Committee called on all cadres to carry out competitions in theoretical work and writing, and advocated among cadres to pass four tests (writing test, theoretical test, cultural and technical test, and labor training test), and required Party committees at all levels to organize evaluations and inspections of theoretical work.

    长工人阶级志气　灭资产阶级威风
    冲破理论研究的神秘观点
    江西省委制定“十、百、千、万”的理论工作规划
    规划要求在1958年内，总结十条开展理论工作的经验，创作百篇以上理论水平较高的文章，写作千篇以上针对实际问题宣传马列主义的文章，开始组织和培养数以万计的兼职、专职理论工作队伍。
    本报南昌26日电　记者李久泽报道：中共江西省委最近举行的省委扩大会议研究了加强理论工作的问题，号召全省干部破除迷信，解放思想，大胆创作，大胆研究，要敢说、敢想、敢写；在理论、学术工作上要长工人阶级的志气，灭资产阶级的威风，反对把理论、学术神秘化，当作高不可攀和劳动人民无缘的资产阶级观点。会议本着这种精神制定了理论工作规划，规划要求在1958年内，总结十条开展理论工作的经验，创作百篇以上理论水平较高的文章，写作千篇以上针对实际问题宣传马列主义的文章，开始组织和培养数以万计的兼职、专职理论工作队伍。会议概括地称这个规划为“十、百、千、万”的理论工作规划。
    会议确定，党的理论工作在今后一个相当长的时期内以宣传和贯彻毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题”和党的社会主义建设总路线为主要内容，以百花齐放百家争鸣、厚今薄古、边干边学、又红又专、红透专深等口号为党的理论工作的方针和方法。
    会议详细地讨论了总结社会主义建设经济、培养又红又专的理论队伍和创办理论刊物等方面的问题。
    为了多快好省地推进江西社会主义建设事业和更好地贯彻执行中央的路线、方针、政策，会议认为，总结本省的社会主义建设的各种经验是党的理论工作的重要任务。为此，会议确定，省、地、县三级党委及相当于县委一级的工矿企业均应在党委直接领导下建立党的写作小组，作为总结社会主义建设经验及开展理论工作的骨干力量。写作小组的成员以党委委员和各方面的骨干为主，组长由党委第一书记或机关主要负责人担任。这种党的写作小组，1958年全省组织二百三十八个，发展成员二千六百零二人；写作小组成员今年每人至少写出三篇文章，共七千八百零六篇，要求其中有较高的理论水平的文章一百篇。为了保证这个规划实现，会议要求在今年5月份内，通过自下而上和自上而下的方法，提出当前的一千个论文题目，并在6月份以前做到五定（定题、定人、定时、定质、定量）。写作方式要多样化，可以采取集体写作、个人写作、做实际工作的同志和专职理论工作者合作等方式。会议要求以全省党的写作小组为核心，在五年内写出一百本社会科学著作，二千本通俗宣传马列主义的小册子，并从今年开始编写江西地方志，各县编县志。
    会议认为，要把理论工作搞好必须培养党的又红又专的理论队伍。经过讨论，会议确定从今年开始，在五年内建立和培养一支有一万五千人左右的理论宣传队伍。
    会议要求五年内全省培养出有较高理论水平的各种人材四百七十人。会议确定今年上半年成立全省的哲学、政治经济学、法学等八个学会，并创办江西省的理论刊物“江西学刊”。会议还讨论了干部轮训和在职干部学习等问题。
    中共江西省委扩大会议要求省、地、县三级根据前些时候的布置争取在今年4月份都要制定出理论工作的规划。省委扩大会议号召全体干部开展理论工作的竞赛、写作竞赛，在干部中提倡过四关（写作关、理论关、文化技术关、劳动锻炼关），要求各级党委组织理论工作的评比检查。
