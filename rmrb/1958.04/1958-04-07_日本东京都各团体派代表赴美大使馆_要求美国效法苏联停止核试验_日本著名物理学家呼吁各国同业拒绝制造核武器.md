Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Tokyo: Representatives of over 150 people from groups such as the Tokyo Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Tokyo Student Union Federation went to the U.S. Embassy in Japan yesterday to demand that the United States respond to the Soviet Union's decision to stop nuclear weapons testing and to stop the planned nuclear weapons tests on Eniwetok Atoll.

When representatives of the groups approached the entrance of the U.S. Embassy, they were blocked by more than 400 Japanese police officers. The representatives' attempt to deliver protest letters from the various groups to the U.S. Embassy was also rejected by U.S. Embassy personnel. The protest letter from the Tokyo Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs pointed out that if the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom ignore the demands of the people of Japan, Asia, Africa, and the world, and insist on continuing to test nuclear weapons, they will inevitably encounter strong opposition from peace-loving people all over the world.

Japanese Communist Party member of the Diet, Yoshio Shiga, addressed the representatives of the various groups.

On the same day, approximately 50 representatives from the Tokyo Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and its affiliated ward branches visited the speakers of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors of the Japanese Diet, requesting the Diet to work towards the realization of a ban on nuclear testing. The representatives also brought petitions with 50,000 signatures demanding that the United States stop conducting nuclear weapons tests on Eniwetok Atoll. The petition also expressed opposition to turning Okinawa and Niijima into nuclear weapons and missile bases, and requested that the Diet take measures to promote the convening of an East-West summit conference in order to sign an agreement for an immediate and unconditional ban on nuclear weapons testing.

Socialist Party member of the Diet, Komakichi Matsuoka, Communist Party member of the Diet, Yoshio Shiga, and Liberal Democratic Party member of the Diet, Umeji Nakamura, among others, addressed the representatives.

The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomies, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and other groups will hold a large-scale mass rally in Tokyo on April 19 to protest against the U.S. nuclear weapons testing on Eniwetok Atoll.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Tokyo: Prominent Japanese physicists Hideki Yukawa and Professor Yukio Hayakawa, along with five others, issued an appeal on the 4th to the conference of physicists from various countries currently being held in Pivo, Quebec, Canada, demanding an immediate and unconditional ban on nuclear testing.

The Japanese physicists called on physicists from all countries to refuse to participate in work related to nuclear weapons.

    新华社6日讯　东京消息：东京都禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会和东京都学生自治会联合会等团体的代表一百五十多人，昨天到美国驻日本大使馆前，要求美国响应苏联关于停止核武器试验的决定，并且停止预定在恩纳威托克岛进行的核武器试验。
    各团体的代表在走近美国大使馆门前的时候，遭到四百多名日本警察的阻拦。代表们要把各团体的抗议书递交给美国大使馆，也遭到美国大使馆人员的拒绝。东京都禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会的抗议书指出，如果美英两国政府忽视日本和亚、非各国以及全世界人民的要求，坚持继续试验核武器，势必遭到全世界爱好和平人民的强烈反对。

    社会党议员松冈驹吉、共产党议员志贺义雄和自由民主党议员中村梅吉等人向代表们讲了话。
    日本工会总评议会、全日本学生自治会总联合会和日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会等团体将于4月19日在东京举行一次大规模的群众集会，抗议美国在恩纳威托克岛进行核武器试验。
