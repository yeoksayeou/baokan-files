Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 5th - Currently, 69% of agricultural land in Czechoslovakia belongs to socialist components. Among them, agricultural cooperatives account for 62%.

This spring, Czechoslovakia's socialist transformation movement in agriculture continued to advance by leaps and bounds. More than 61,200 people and a total of 263,000 hectares of agricultural land joined cooperatives. Three hundred and eighty-six new cooperatives were established, including 22,829 members and nearly 113,000 hectares of land. The number of farmers joining cooperatives this spring increased by almost 48,000 compared to the same period last year.

The Pilsen region is the first region in the country where every village has a cooperative; there are 1,132 cooperatives there; socialist components account for 87% of agricultural land.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 5th - Czechoslovak youth actively participate in agricultural labor and have become an active force in the countryside.

Five hundred youth production teams have been established in agricultural cooperatives across the country. In the Bratislava region alone, 10,000 young people are engaged in agricultural labor.

Young people are playing a good role in improving agricultural production methods and improving agricultural management. In addition, they also actively participate in rural political power work and engage in labor such as building roads, parks, and cultural palaces.

The movement to mobilize young people to participate in agricultural production in Czechoslovakia is continuing to unfold. Currently, rural youth conferences are being held in counties across the country. These conferences mainly discuss how to encourage more young people to join agricultural cooperatives and how young members can contribute to increasing agricultural production.

    百分之六十九的农业土地属于社会主义成分
    新华社布拉格5日电　目前，捷克斯洛伐克农业土地中已经有69％属于社会主义成分。其中农业合作社占62％。
    今年春季，捷克斯洛伐克农业的社会主义改造运动继续大踏步前进。有六万一千二百多人以及总共二十六万三千公顷的农业土地加入了合作社。新建的合作社有三百八十六个，包括二万二千八百二十九个社员和将近十一万三千公顷的土地。今年春季加入合作社的农民，比去年同期几乎增加了四万八千人。
    比尔森州是全国第一个村村有合作社的州；那里有一千一百三十二个合作社；农业土地中的社会主义成分占87％。
    据新华社布拉格5日电　捷克斯洛伐克的青年积极参加农业劳动，成为农村中一支活跃的力量。
    在全国各地的农业合作社中，已经建立了五百个青年生产队。仅在布拉迪斯拉发州，就有一万名青年从事农业劳动。
    在改进农业生产方法和改善农业经营等方面，青年们都起着良好的作用。此外，他们还积极参加农村政权工作，从事修建道路、公园和文化宫等劳动。
    捷克斯洛伐克动员青年参加农业生产的运动正在继续展开。目前，全国各县正在召开农村青年会议，这些会议主要是讨论怎样争取更多的青年参加农业合作社和青年社员如何为提高农业生产贡献出自己的力量等问题。
