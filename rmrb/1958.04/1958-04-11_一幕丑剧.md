A Farce
After the U.S. State Department recently issued a statement interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, and faced strong protests from Indonesia, it has now come out with an "explanation." A Washington "observer" said that the State Department's statement was only drafted by the Far East Bureau led by Robertson, and had not been approved by Dulles, and that Dulles was "quite dissatisfied" with the wording of the statement.

Thus, Robertson was slapped in the face, while Dulles had quite a bit of powder applied, as if the two were playing different roles. The gentlemen in Washington think very cleverly: they believe that as long as they perform this way, the Indonesian people will be deceived, and the negative impact of the U.S. State Department's statement will be eliminated.

However, the Indonesian people will not be so forgetful. Has Dulles himself made fewer remarks interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs than Robertson? Now, the high priest actually comes out to blame the lesser priest, saying that he should not practice witchcraft! This is truly a disgusting farce.

    一幕丑剧
    美国国务院最近发表了干涉印度尼西亚内政的声明以后，由于遭到印度尼西亚的强烈抗议，现在又出来加以“解释”。华盛顿的“观察家”说，国务院那个声明只是罗伯逊所领导的远东司草拟的，并没有得到杜勒斯的批准，而且杜勒斯对这个声明的措辞还“相当不满”。
    于是，罗伯逊的脸上挨了一记耳光，而杜勒斯的脸上却擦了不少脂粉，似乎两个人是扮演不同角色的。华盛顿的先生们想得很妙：他们以为只要这样一表演，印度尼西亚人民就会受骗，美国国务院声明的恶劣影响就会消除。
    可是，印度尼西亚人民并不会那么健忘，杜勒斯本人发表过的干涉印度尼西亚内政的谈话，难道比罗伯逊少吗？现在，大巫居然出来责备小巫，说他不该做弄巫术！这真是一幕令人作呕的丑剧。
