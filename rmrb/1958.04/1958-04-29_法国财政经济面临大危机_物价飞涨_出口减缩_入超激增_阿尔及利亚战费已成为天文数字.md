Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 26th. Correspondent Yang Xiaonong reports: The continuing deterioration of France's economic and financial situation is causing serious anxiety among French bourgeois public opinion.

    Georges Villiers, Chairman of the National Council of French Employers, recently pointed out that France is facing an extremely serious crisis due to insufficient exports. According to recent data from the French financial newspaper "Les Echos," France's foreign trade deficit reached 120 billion francs in the first quarter of this year. The March deficit reached 39 billion francs, an increase of 8 billion francs over February. March exports only covered 71% of imports.

      "Les Echos," in analyzing the reasons for the increasing trade deficit, believes that one of the reasons is that rising prices have reduced commodity exports. The newspaper pointed out that French prices have risen by 18% in the past year and are still rising. It is reported that thirteen more kinds of food have risen in price in the past week.

    The increase in the foreign trade deficit is deteriorating the foreign exchange reserve situation. "Les Echos" pessimistically said that if the deficit increases at the current rate, France will exhaust the $650 million borrowed in January by the fall of this year, and the franc may depreciate further.

    In terms of finance, as the French ruling class continues its colonial war in Algeria, this year's military expenditures are bound to exceed the original budget. According to calculations by local newspapers, the government's decision to extend the service of 35,000 soldiers whose service period has expired by three months will require an additional expenditure of nearly 20 billion francs. Moreover, the Ministry of National Defense has requested an additional 25 billion francs for manufacturing aircraft. These two items alone exceed the budget by nearly 45 billion francs.

    To solve the budget overrun, the French government must resort to issuing public bonds, further reducing investment, and increasing new taxes. However, French economic experts currently hold reservations about issuing public bonds and believe that investment reductions have already exceeded the limit, and further reductions will inevitably have adverse effects on production. As for increasing taxes, this will not only arouse popular opposition but also lead to a further shrinking of the domestic market.

    French newspapers believe that under the trend of increasing foreign trade deficits, the French authorities will be forced to take measures to limit the speed of production expansion and restrict raw material imports. These newspapers fear that restricting raw material imports will cause industrial production to decline immediately, and economic recession and unemployment will become terrible specters threatening France.

Xinhua News Agency, April 28th. The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" reported not long ago: "The budgeted expenditure for the Algerian War in 1958 has reached 900 billion francs."

    The newspaper cited statistics published in the April issue of the monthly "Économie et Politique," pointing out that the minimum actual expenditure for the Algerian War includes the following figures:

    Cost of military operations 712 billion francs
    Expenditure on suppression agencies 72.5 billion francs
    Supplementary expenses 17 billion francs
    Total 801.5 billion francs

    In addition, due to rising prices and the current intensification of military operations, expenditures will increase by at least 10%. Furthermore, increasing the number of French troops stationed in Algeria by 30,000 will require an additional expenditure of 95 billion francs. In this way, the wealth consumed by the colonial war in Algeria this year far exceeds the level of 2 billion francs per day, reaching an astonishing figure of nearly 900 billion francs per year.

### 法国财政经济面临大危机  物价飞涨　出口减缩　入超激增  阿尔及利亚战费已成为天文数字

    法国财政经济面临大危机
    物价飞涨　出口减缩　入超激增
    阿尔及利亚战费已成为天文数字
    据新华社巴黎26日电　本社记者杨效农报道：法国经济和财政情况的继续恶化引起法国资产阶级舆论的严重不安。
    法国雇主全国委员会主席乔治·维伊埃最近指出，由于出口不足，法国正面临着极端严重的危机。据法国金融报纸“回声报”最近的资料，在今年第一季，法国对外贸易逆差达到一千二百亿法郎。其中3月份逆差达三百九十亿法郎，比2月份增加了八十亿法郎。3月份出口额只能抵销进口额的71％。
      “回声报”在分析贸易逆差增加的原因时认为，原因之一是物价上涨使商品出口减缩。这家报纸指出，过去一年中，法国物价上涨了18％，而且目前还在继续上涨。据报道，在最近一周中，又有十三种食品涨了价。
    对外贸易逆差的增加正在使外汇储备情况恶化。“回声报”悲观地说，如果逆差按照目前速度上升，到今年秋季法国就将耗尽1月份借来的六亿五千万美元，而法郎也还有进一步贬值的可能。
    在财政方面，由于法国统治阶级继续在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争，今年的军事开支势必超过预算原定数目。据此间报纸计算，政府决定延长服兵役期满的三万五千人的服役期三个月就必须增加开支近二百亿法郎，而为了制造飞机，国防部又要求增拨二百五十亿法郎，仅此两项即超过预算近四百五十亿法郎。
    法国政府要解决预算超支，就得乞灵于发行公债、进一步缩减投资和增收新税。但是法国的经济专家们目前对发行公债抱着保留态度，同时也认为缩减投资已经超过限度，再缩减势必对生产造成恶果。至于增税，这不但将激起人民的反对，而且还将导致国内市场的进一步萎缩。
    法国报纸认为，在对外贸易逆差增加的趋势下，法国当局将被迫采取限制生产扩展速度和限制原料进口的措施。这些报纸担心，限制原料进口将使工业生产立即下降，经济衰退和失业将成为威胁法国的可怕的魔影。
    新华社28日讯　法国共产党机关报“人道报”不久以前报道说：“1958年阿尔及利亚战争的预算支出达到九千亿法郎。”
    报纸引用“经济与政治”月刊4月号所刊登的统计材料，指出阿尔及利亚战争的最低限度实际支出包括下列数字：
    军事行动费用　七千一百二十亿法郎
    镇压机构的开支　七百二十五亿法郎
    补充开支　一百七十亿法郎
    总计　八千零一十五亿法郎
    除此以外，由于物价上涨和目前军事行动的加强，开支至少还要增加10％。再加上驻阿尔及利亚法军人数要增加三万人，就需要再增加九百五十亿法郎的额外支出。这样，今年在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争所消耗的财富就远远超过每天二十亿法郎的水平，而达到一年将近九千亿法郎的惊人数字。
