    Why are the photos so bad?
    We came to the capital of the motherland from the remote border region, and everyone was very happy to take a group photo in front of Tiananmen. The result was disappointing. It turned out that the photos taken by the Zhongshan Park Photography Department were so terrible. All ten of us looked strange, either blind or with crooked mouths, none of us looking like ourselves.
    In the short few days we have been in the capital, we have indeed felt that all service units are leaping forward, and the service personnel's work quality and attitude are very good. Why are the photos taken by the Zhongshan Park Photography Department so bad?

    为什么照得这样糟糕？
    我们从遥远的边疆来到祖国的首都，大家很高兴地到天安门前合照了一张像片。结果却很失望。原来中山公园照像部照出来的照片是这样糟糕。我们十个人个个照得怪头怪脑，不是瞎子，就是歪嘴，没有一个像本人模样。
    我们来到首都短短的几天内，确实感到各个服务单位都在跃进，服务人员的工作质量和工作态度都很好。为什么中山公园照像部所照的像是这样糟糕呢？
