Xinhua News Agency, 12th: At today's Third National Youth Congress, many representatives expressed their determination in their speeches: to resolutely and vigorously remold their thinking and temper themselves into red and expert socialist laborers.

Youth representatives from the fields of science, education, and art and literature focused on the issue of ideological remolding in their speeches today. Hu Zhaosen, assistant engineer at Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, vividly described his process of combining with workers and arduously remolding himself over the past few years. He felt alienated from the workers when he first joined them, feeling strange and lonely among them. After the Party's help and his own ideological struggle, he shed the airs of an intellectual and lived and worked with the workers, gradually establishing a close friendship with them. He said that in order to thoroughly remold himself, he is now working as a fitter, and he plans to reach the level of an eighth-grade worker within five years, truly becoming a proletarian intellectual.

Mei Zhentong, an assistant researcher at the Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences who was sent to the countryside three months ago to participate in labor training, said that now he doesn't feel that cow and sheep manure are so dirty and smelly when he holds them in his hands, but rather that they are treasures; growing potatoes is impossible without them. Wearing patched clothes and pulling a large cart on the street, he is not embarrassed, but proud; in the countryside, everyone compares who has the darkest tan, who has the most calluses, and who has the strongest labor power. These all show that our thoughts and feelings have begun to change, but to become both red and expert cadres, long-term and arduous efforts are still needed, and we are fully determined to move in this direction. The famous Peking opera actress Du Jinfang reported to the conference her personal red and expert plan and the measures to achieve it. She proposed to perform for workers and peasants for three months each year; participate in at least two voluntary labor activities each month; and study Marxism-Leninism conscientiously, striving to become a glorious Communist Party member within two years.

Tu Yu, General Secretary of the National Association of the Young Men's Christian Association of China, said that the staff of the YMCA must resolutely destroy capitalism and establish socialism, and thoroughly remold their thinking, otherwise they will not be able to keep up with the situation and take the socialist road.

Youth representatives from industrial and commercial circles from twelve regions, including Guangdong, Liaoning, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Tianjin, Qingdao, Xiamen, Lanzhou, Changsha, Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuhu, unanimously stated in their speeches and written statements that under the new situation of the current socialist all-round great leap forward, young people in industrial and commercial circles must also be determined to make a great leap forward in the fundamental transformation of their political stance, and strive to transform themselves into self-reliant laborers in a shorter period of time. Many of them talked about how handing their hearts over to the Party and to socialism is the key to the transformation of young people in industrial and commercial circles. The faster, more thorough, deeper, and truer one hands over their heart, the earlier they can dig out the old roots of capitalism and plant the new seedlings of socialism.

Many young representatives of ethnic minorities criticized local nationalism in their speeches today, believing that it is a major enemy that endangers the unification of the motherland and the socialist cause, and must be resolutely eliminated. Bai Wenda from the Hui ethnic group in Heilongjiang, Tao Chenglin from the Manchu ethnic group, Wu Changhao from the Korean ethnic group, and Bao Lianhua from the Mongolian ethnic group said in a joint speech that through rectification and socialist education, we have clarified the major issues of right and wrong in ethnic issues, and we must follow the Communist Party on the socialist road. They said that our young ethnic minority cadres must strengthen self-remolding, thoroughly examine and eliminate non-working-class thinking, firmly stand our ground, resolutely learn from the advanced experience of the Han people, and help the ethnic minorities achieve prosperity and development with the help of the Han people.

A total of sixty-nine people spoke or submitted written statements at the conference today.

During the conference, forty young people of various ethnic groups from the Central University for Nationalities, representing young people of more than fifty ethnic groups in the entire university, came to congratulate the conference and delivered congratulatory messages.

    做红透专深的社会主义劳动者
    青年代表在青代会上表示要顽强地进行思想改造
    据新华社12日讯　在今天的中华全国青年第三次代表大会上，许多代表在发言中表达了自己的决心：要坚决、顽强地进行思想改造，把自己锻炼成为红透专深的社会主义劳动者。
    科学、教育、文艺界的青年代表今天着重地就思想改造问题发表了意见。鞍山钢铁建设公司助理工程师胡兆森生动地介绍了他几年来和工人结合，艰苦改造自己的过程。他开始和工人在一起时感到和工人有隔阂，在他们当中很陌生、很孤单，经过党的帮助和自己的思想斗争，放下了知识分子架子，和工人同生活、同劳动，逐渐和工人建立了亲密的友谊。他说，为了彻底改造自己，现在我已当了钳工，我计划在五年内达到八级工的水平，真正做一个无产阶级的知识分子。
    三个月前下放到农村参加劳动锻炼的中国科学院生理生化研究所助理研究员梅镇彤说，现在牛、羊粪拿在手里不觉得那么脏、那么臭了，反觉得它是宝，种马铃薯少了它就不行。穿着补了的衣服拉着大车上街，不但不怕难为情，反而感到自豪；在农村大家都比谁的脸晒得黑、谁的手长的老茧多，谁的劳动力强。这些都说明我们的思想感情开始发生变化，但是要使自己成为又红又专的干部，还需要长期艰苦的努力，我们完全有决心向这个方向前进。著名京剧演员杜近芳向大会报告了她个人的红、专规划和实现这个规划的措施。她提出每年要为工农演出三个月；每月至少参加两次义务劳动；认真学习马列主义，争取两年内成为一个光荣的共产党员。
    中华基督教青年会全国协会总干事涂羽说，青年会工作人员必须坚决破资本主义立社会主义，彻底改造自己的思想，否则就不能跟上形势，走社会主义道路。
    来自广东、辽宁、云南、江西、天津、青岛、厦门、兰州、长沙、苏州、常州、芜湖等十二个地区的工商界青年代表在发言和书面发言中一致表示，在当前社会主义全面大跃进的新形势下，工商界青年也要下定决心在政治立场的根本改造上来一个大跃进，争取在更短的时间内把自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。其中许多人谈到，把心交给党、交给社会主义是工商界青年进行脱胎换骨改造的关键，谁要是把心交得越快、越透、越深、越真，谁就能够比较早地挖去资本主义的老根，种下社会主义的新苗。
    许多少数民族青年代表在今天发言时批判了地方民族主义思想，认为这是危害祖国统一和社会主义事业的大敌，必须坚决加以清除。黑龙江回族代表白文达、满族代表陶成林、朝鲜族代表吴昌镐、蒙古族代表包莲花在联合发言中说，通过整风和社会主义教育，我们辩明了民族问题上的大是大非，我们要跟共产党走社会主义道路。他们说，我们少数民族青年干部必须加强自我改造，彻底检查和肃清非工人阶级思想，坚定立场，坚决学习汉族的先进经验，在汉族人民的帮助下使少数民族得到繁荣和发展。
    今天在大会上发言或书面发言的共六十九人。
    在大会进行中，中央民族学院的四十名各民族青年，代表全院五十多个民族的青年来向大会祝贺，并致贺词。
