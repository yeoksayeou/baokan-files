Honeydew and Aphids Ruo Lu

    In the past, many people believed that "honeydew" was dew that fell from the sky, as sweet as honey, and that eating it could prolong life. Therefore, they revered it as "heavenly wine" and "divine nectar." Emperor Wu of Han even specially set up a dew-collecting plate in the Jianzhang Palace, towering into the clouds, hoping for the pity of heaven. When Emperor Xuan of Han heard that honeydew had fallen in the capital, he even changed the name of his reign to "Honeydew."...
    In fact, the so-called honeydew is actually the excrement of aphids. Aphids are small insects that parasitize the branches and leaves of plants, somewhat like lice, so they are also called "wood lice." They have different names in different places. In Guizhou, they are called "ground honey," in Jiangxi, "May ants," in Zhejiang, "Yous," and in the north, "oil bugs" or "late bugs." Because the juice they excrete is very sweet, ants love it very much, and often move them back to their nests to raise, just like people raise dairy cows, so they also got the title of "ant cows." There are many kinds of aphids, the common ones are cotton aphids, wheat aphids, grape phylloxera, cabbage aphids, peach aphids, apple aphids, sugarcane cotton aphids, and bean aphids. Moreover, aphids are widely distributed, with traces of them all over the world except for the polar regions. When the earth returns to spring and plants sprout and sprout leaves, they follow and become active in groups, carrying out destructive activities against plants.
    The first person to discover that honeydew was the excrement of aphids was Du Hao of the Ming Dynasty. He wrote: "...This is a place with many insects. There must be a lot of dew under the leaves, which tastes sweet. It is the urine of insects. People mistakenly think that this dew is an auspicious sign. It is bird food, not honeydew." This is believable, because in ancient times it was said that honeydew was very sweet and that it fell on the branches and leaves of plants. For example, Su Shi's "Records of Similar Things" said: "This dew falls from the sky and sticks to plants like malt sugar." This completely matches the taste and location of aphid excrement. Another example is "Supplementary Records," which says: "There is honeydew on Mount Kunlun...when it sticks to plants, it is as white and bright as snow." According to some types of aphids, such as apple woolly aphids, the body is covered with wax. In the vigorous breeding summer, white patches can often appear on the tree, which looks like hanging snowflakes from a distance. What is said in "Supplementary Records" is likely this phenomenon. (If this phenomenon appears on apple trees, there is no hope for the harvest.) In short, from many aspects, honeydew and aphid excrement seem to be the same thing, and no one has raised any objections to this statement.
    When aphids excrete, they often use a spraying method, and they like to gather in groups of thousands. Therefore, if you happen to be under a flower or tree, this excrement can often float onto our faces. Occasionally tasting its sweetness, it feels a bit like heavenly dew.
    Aphid excrement contains about 70% sugar (of which about a quarter is reducing sugar such as glucose), and about 3% protein and more than 20% dextrin. Therefore, although it cannot "nourish you for years without hunger or thirst" as Su Shi said, nor will it allow you to "live for eight hundred years without dying" as the "Classic of Mountains and Seas" says. Su Shi's "Records of Similar Things" says that honeydew can moisten the five internal organs, and Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" says that it can treat various heat-related ailments of the chest and diaphragm and improve vision and quench thirst. From the composition of honeydew, these two statements are not without some truth.
    However, precisely because aphid excrement is sweet and nutritious, it easily attracts ants and other insects. While eating aphid excrement, they also gnaw at the stems and leaves of plants, driving away beneficial insects. Moreover, aphid excrement also nourishes a large number of bacteria (such as coal fungus, which blackens the leaves) that harm plants. Aphid excrement also has a sticky effect and can hinder the physiological functions of plants. These disadvantages completely overshadow its sweet and nourishing advantages. Therefore, except for aphids that can produce gallnuts, it is best to try every means to eliminate other types of aphids.

### 甘露和蚜虫

    甘露和蚜虫　若芦
    从前很多人相信“甘露”是从天上降下的露水，甘甜如蜜，吃了可以延年益寿，因而尊它为“天酒”和“神浆”。汉武帝还特地在建章宫设置了承露盘，高耸入云，希冀上天怜赐。汉宣帝听到甘露降于京都，竟把原来的年号也改成了“甘露”。……
    其实，所谓甘露，原来是蚜虫的排泄物。蚜虫是寄生在草木枝叶上的小昆虫，有点像虱，所以又有“木虱”的名称。各地对它的称呼也不同，贵州称地蜜，江西称蝣蚁，浙江一带称蚰，北方称油虫、迟虫。又由于它排泄的汁液很甜，蚂蚁非常嗜爱，常常把它搬回自己的巢穴中饲养，好像人们饲养乳牛一样，因此又得到了“蚁牛”的称号。蚜虫种类很多，常见的有棉蚜、麦蚜、葡萄瘤蚜、白菜蚜、桃蚜、苹果蚜、甘蔗棉蚜、豆蚜等。而且蚜虫的分布很广，除了两极地区，世界各地有它的踪迹。大地回春，草木抽芽吐叶以后，它们跟着就成群地活动起来，对植物进行破坏活动。
    最早发现甘露就是蚜虫的排泄物的，要算明朝的杜镐。他有一段文字说：“……此多虫之所，叶下必多露，味甘，乃是虫之尿也。人误此露为瑞祥，乃雀饧，非甘露也。这是可以相信的，因为古时都说甘露很甜，又说是降落在草木的枝叶上，例如苏轼的物类相感志说：“此露天降，着草木上，如饴糖。”这和蚜虫排泄物的滋味及所在，都完全吻合。又如拾遗记说：“昆仑之山有甘露，……着草木则皎莹如雪。”按蚜虫中有些种类，如苹果棉蚜，体上披有蜡质，在繁殖旺盛的夏季，往往可使树上呈现白白的斑块，远远看去，很像是凝挂着的雪花，拾遗记所说的，很可能就是这种现象（苹果树如果出现了这种现象，收成便无望了）。总之，从很多方面看，甘露和蚜虫的排泄物，实在很像是一种东西，并且现在也没有人对这种说法提出异议。
    蚜虫在排泄的时候，常常采取喷射的方式，加以它们又喜欢千万成群地聚集在一块，因此在花前树下的当儿，如果凑巧，这种排泄物往往可以漂扑到我们的脸上来。偶然尝到它的甜味，就很有点像是天降甘露了。
    蚜虫排泄物中含糖质70％左右（其中葡萄糖之类的转化糖就占四分之一左右），而且，还有约3％的蛋白质，20％多的糊精。所以它虽然不能像苏轼所说的“食之长年不饥渴”，也不会像山海经所说，吃了之后，“不寿者八百岁”。苏轼的物类相感志说甘露能润人五脏，李时珍的本草纲目又说它可治胸膈诸热，明目止渴。从甘露的成分上看，这两种说法不无一些道理。
    然而，正由于蚜虫的排泄物有甜味和养分，所以极容易招来蚂蚁和其他昆虫。它们在饮食蚜虫的排泄物之余，还会噬啮植物的茎叶，驱走有益的昆虫。而且蚜虫排泄物也会滋养大量的病菌（例如使叶面变黑的煤菌），侵害植物。蚜虫排泄物还有粘复作用，又能阻碍植物的生理机能。这种种害处，就把它那味甜而滋补的优点，掩没无余了。因此，除了能够制造五倍子的蚜虫以外，对于其他各种蚜虫，还是想尽办法去歼灭的好。
