    Xiangxi Discovers "Teng Tong"
    (Reported by this newspaper) A wild oil crop with an oil content as high as 50% has been discovered in the mountains and ridges of Qiatong Township, Guzhang County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. Local Tujia farmers call it "Teng Tong."
    "Teng Tong" is an annual herb, with vines reaching several dozen feet in length, resembling wild kudzu. It branches and spreads, with the "Tong" fruit hanging from the leaf axils. It is about the size of an apple, with twenty to thirty seeds per fruit, similar in shape and size to oil-tea seeds. "Teng Tong" oil is yellow and transparent, with a quality similar to the "Golden Tung Oil" of the autonomous prefecture. The Autonomous Prefecture Forestry Bureau attaches great importance to this discovery and has sent technical cadres to investigate and study it.

    湘西发现藤桐
    本报讯　在湘西土家族苗族自治州古丈县茄通乡的丛山峻岭里，发现一种含油量高达50％的野生油料作物。当地土家族农民称它为藤桐。
    藤桐是一年生草本，藤长数丈，很像野葛，生枝蔓延，桐球结挂在叶腋上，有苹果那么大，每球有子二十到三十粒，形状、大小都像油茶子。藤桐油呈黄色，透明，质量同自治州的“金色桐油”一样。自治州林业局很重视这个发现，已派技术干部去调查研究。
