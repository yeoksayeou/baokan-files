Seriously Criticize the Idea of Fame and Fortune
Bai Sheng

During the Two-Anti Movement in some universities in Beijing, it was revealed that many teachers, on the one hand, complained about being too busy, saying that they had to attend meetings every day, compile teaching materials, and write textbooks, and simply didn't have time for teaching and scientific research; but on the other hand, many teachers were busy writing external articles, writing papers for academic journals or translating books, writing pamphlets for publishing houses, engaging in their own set of work, and cultivating a "private plot."

Is this practice right? If one truly does a good job in the teaching work one is responsible for, and if one writes articles and translates books for academic journals or publishing houses in close connection with teaching and scientific research, then there is nothing wrong with it, and it should even be encouraged. However, things are not like this. Some teachers, who are also directors of teaching and research departments, have long neglected the work of the teaching and research department, do not guide young teachers in collective lesson preparation, and do not care about the students' learning situation, burying themselves in writing external articles and translating books all day long. Some teachers do not prepare lessons carefully before class, piecing things together and perfunctorily dealing with the class, and do not provide specific guidance for students' homework. Some old teachers even simply push the teaching tasks and the task of compiling textbooks entrusted to them by the state onto the young people. It is said that a theory is popular among them, saying that teaching is "output" and not beneficial to oneself, while only writing articles, writing books, or translating books is "input" and can bring both fame and fortune. Because some old teachers have this bourgeois idea of personal fame and fortune, it also affects some young teachers who neglect teaching work and are only eager to become famous, losing interest in teaching work. Therefore, they are very unwilling to be assigned a few more hours of classes.

Today, this bourgeois idea of personal fame and fortune among teachers is seriously harming the teaching work of universities and spreading poison. It not only affects the quality of teaching but also corrodes the thinking of young teachers and students. This bourgeois idea of personal fame and fortune should be seriously criticized.

    严肃批判名利思想
    柏生
    北京有些高等学校在双反运动中，揭露出不少教师一方面喊叫工作忙，说什么每天又要开会，又要编讲义，还要写教科书，简直没有时间搞教学工作和科学研究工作；但另一方面不少教师却在忙着写外稿，给学报写论文或翻译书，给出版社写小册子，搞自己的一套工作，搞一块“自留地”。
    这种作法对不对呢？如果真正把自己所担负的教学工作作好了，而且是密切结合教学和科学研究工作而给学报或者出版社写稿子和翻译书，那是没有什么不对的，甚至是应该鼓励的。但是，事情并不是这样的。有的教师身兼教研室主任，长期不过问教研室的工作，也不指导青年教师集体备课，也不关心学生的学习情况，整天埋头写外稿、翻译书。有的教师在上课前不认真备课，到上课的时候东拼西凑，马马虎虎地应付一堂，对学生课业不作具体指导。有的老教师甚至索性把教学任务和国家委托他们编写教科书的任务，往青年身上一推就算了。据说在他们中间还流行着一种理论，说教学是“输出”，对自己没有利，只有写稿子写书或翻译书才是“输入”，能名利双收。由于某些老教师有这种资产阶级的名利思想，也就影响着某些青年教师忽视教学工作，一心想成名家，对教学工作不感兴趣，因此多分配几小时的课，就大不愿意。
    今天，教师中这种资产阶级个人名利思想，严重地危害着高等学校的教学工作，散布着毒素，它不但影响着教学质量，也腐蚀着青年教师和学生的思想。这种资产阶级个人名利思想应该受到严肃的批评。
