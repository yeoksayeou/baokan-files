How Beijing's Qianmen District is Adjusting its Commercial Network
By our reporter Zhang Zhiqing

Beijing is comprehensively adjusting the commercial network of Qianmen District. This adjustment of the commercial network proceeds from the convenience of the masses, and is carried out in the spirit of increasing or decreasing according to different regions and different industries, so as to make the distribution of the commercial network more reasonable.

Changing the Uneven Distribution
Qianmen District is one of the areas in Beijing where commerce is concentrated. The district has more than 1,700 stores with more than 13,700 employees. On average, there is one store for every 27 households and one commercial worker for every 14 people. Although there are many stores in this district, their distribution is very uneven. For example, Qianmen Street has 116 stores, and Dashilar Street alone has 55. Moreover, stores are duplicated. For example, on Dashilar Street, which is about 290 meters long, there are 15 clothing and shoe stores alone. The residential area of Yanshou Temple Street has five meat shops and eight oil and salt shops, while the areas of Houheyan and Haibei Temple Street have no stores at all. Due to the concentration of stores in some areas and the lack of stores in residential areas, the unreasonable distribution has brought many inconveniences to the masses. At the same time, the low labor efficiency of employees also wastes state funds. After this adjustment, the commercial network has been reasonably arranged, changing the uneven and duplicate distribution of stores in the past. For example, in the case of non-staple food stores, which are closely related to the lives of the masses, an average of one large non-staple food department store with a complete range of goods is set up in every two street offices. At the same time, each street office has two or three comprehensive stores, as well as seven to nine general non-staple food stores. Bathhouses and the catering industry have been comprehensively arranged. This setup is roughly adapted to the local purchasing power level. The management structure has been merged from the original 26 (including 10 cross-district) into five management organizations for department stores, non-staple foods, coal and building materials, services, and catering. The number of employees in the district has been reduced by about 50% compared to the past, the cost level will be reduced from 11.9% in 1957 to 6.72%, labor efficiency will be more than doubled, and the amount of working capital occupied will be reduced by 40%, thereby accelerating capital turnover.

Breaking Down Industry Boundaries
This adjustment of the commercial network implements the spirit of convenience for the masses in many ways. In order to completely solve the unreasonable distribution of the commercial network, this adjustment breaks down the boundaries between state-owned, joint state-private, and industries. The specific approach is to adopt different methods for adjustment according to the different characteristics of different regions and different industries.

The first method is: In order to eliminate store duplication and facilitate mass purchases, the specific approach is to change small stores into large stores, and to change stores that sell single commodities into comprehensive stores that sell multiple commodities. The main industries that adopt this method are non-staple food retail stores, daily-use department stores, etc. For example, in Dashilar, a commercial center, the original six duplicate department stores have been merged into one large comprehensive department store. The original four clothing stores have been merged into one larger clothing store. The residential area of Dagouyan originally had six small non-staple food retail stores, all of which sold very few varieties. After this merger into a comprehensive retail store, the variety has increased from 207 to more than 1,300. After the merger of the stores, each store has a different division of labor, and the goods are complete. The masses can buy many kinds of goods in one store, instead of running all over the street as before.

The second method is: If a store has few varieties, but the masses need them very much, the original location can be maintained, and the storefront can be expanded and varieties added to meet the needs of the masses. The industries that mainly adopt this method are traditional Chinese medicine, hairdressing, catering, bathhouses, etc. For example, the Tongrentang Chinese medicine store in Dashilar has not moved from its original location, but has expanded its decoctions and prepared slices, and added a special counter for new medicines, so that customers can also buy necessary new medicines here. Service industries such as bathhouses and hairdressing in residential areas did not have many original locations, and the residents needed them very much. This time, units that had good connections with the masses and good conditions were expanded, and seats were added. For example, in the catering industry in the district, many restaurants did not have breakfast and supper. This time, according to the needs of the masses and the existing equipment and housing conditions, the original restaurants were expanded, and nine restaurants added breakfast and supper, basically meeting the needs of the masses.

The third method is: In streets lacking stores and streets where the distribution of stores is not appropriate, new locations can be appropriately added and relocated according to the local purchasing power level and needs. Forty-two new commercial locations have been added in this adjustment of the commercial network. For example, Dashilar, a commercial center, has a large flow of customers and urgently needs to add a consignment department and a teahouse, which have been added this time. The residential areas of Chashi Hutong and Houheyan did not have any stores, and it was very inconvenient for residents to buy goods. In addition to the newly built comprehensive non-staple food and department store retail stores, a breakfast shop was also newly built in the Chashi Hutong area to facilitate residents. In the Houqingchang area of the Xiangluying residential area, an oil and salt store has been newly established this time, which is convenient for residents of more than a dozen nearby streets. Yangmeizhu Xiejie, a residential area, originally had two non-staple food stores. One small non-staple food store was in the middle, and the other non-staple food store with more goods was located in the west end, which was inconvenient for residents to buy things. This time, the non-staple food store in the west end was moved to the very middle of the street to facilitate residents.

The fourth method is: For hardware, electrical appliances, chemicals, mineral oil, and watches and glasses industries that are not daily necessities for the masses, this time, a larger merger has been adopted and concentrated on Qianmen Street with convenient transportation, to facilitate relevant enterprises, agencies, and out-of-town customers.

Retaining Stores with Characteristics
In this adjustment, attention has been paid to retaining and developing some stores that do have operating characteristics and special needs. For example, Tongrentang Pharmacy, Ruifuxiang Cloth Store, Neiliansheng Shoe Store, Majuyuan Hat Store, and the famous Shaomai Restaurant Du Yi Chu have all been retained. Some have even expanded their storefronts. Proper arrangements have also been made for ethnic minority shoe and hat stores and food stores. In addition, some shops that are not needed in this district but are needed in the city, and that have technical personnel and equipment, are relocated across districts according to needs. For example, Yongan Tang Chinese medicine store has been moved to Dongdan.

In order to facilitate customers, a series of improvement measures have also been taken in operation while adjusting the commercial network. For example, although some residential areas have been withdrawn from the network, mobile vending carts have been added to supply goods to the small alleys at fixed times, lines, and locations, and deliver goods to their doorsteps. In order to take care of the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled, each store also implemented a system of dividing areas and delivering goods on a regular appointment basis. Telephone delivery has been implemented for agencies and organizations. Some stores have added window sales after closing at night. In addition, they have come up with ways to facilitate the masses, such as processing goods for customers. In the cloth, department store, and non-staple food industries, the cargo positions have been reorganized and open-style sales have been adopted to facilitate customers' selection.

This adjustment of the commercial network not only facilitates the masses, but is also a major reform of commercial enterprises themselves. This reform has made unified arrangements for the commercial network of the whole district, reduced management institutions, and strengthened cooperation between enterprises. For example, in the processing of medicinal raw materials in the district, Tongrentang has slicing machines, grinding machines, and pill-making machines, which are often underutilized and have a very low equipment utilization rate, while the processing equipment of Qingrentang Pharmacy is very backward, using a small donkey to pull a mill. After this merger into the Tongrentang processing factory for unified processing, the efficiency of the equipment has been brought into play and the quality of the medicinal materials has been guaranteed. After the unified adjustment of the commercial network, it also solved the long-term problems of employees' living and welfare. Employees have rest rooms and canteens, which have created good conditions for the implementation of the one-shift-to-the-end sales system and inspired the employees' work enthusiasm.

Relying on the Masses to Determine Locations
The adjustment of the Qianmen District commercial network was carried out on the basis of the rectification movement. After the rectification movement, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of employees and residents has been improved. The employees have posted more than 80,000 big-character posters on the redundancy of personnel and the request to merge stores and adjust the commercial network. The residents have put forward more than 50,000 opinions on commercial aspects. Under such circumstances, the relevant leading departments of Qianmen District, according to the opinions of the broad masses of employees and residents, formed a working group to conduct a survey of the commercial network, and then mobilized the employees to discuss and let the masses determine the location. The specific approach is to first let the working group put forward opinions on the establishment of locations based on the on-site understanding of the housing settings, referring to the past habits of customers, and sales conditions in Dashilar, Qianmen Street, the main streets where commerce is concentrated, and then submit them to the masses of all strata for discussion, and finally draw up a plan, and repeatedly modify it to determine the final plan.

In residential areas, the method of mass location determination and three meetings to finalize the plan was adopted. At the first meeting, the significance and purpose of adjusting the commercial network were clearly explained to the employees, the directors of the street residents' committees, the commercial supervisors, and some residents, and they were organized to discuss them separately, and the masses were asked to first put forward their own opinions on the establishment, relocation, and merger of locations. At the second meeting, the working group drew up a map of the adjustment of store distribution based on the opinions of employees and the masses combined with the actual survey situation. Then, discussions were held separately with the masses and employees. When opinions were inconsistent during the discussion process, the understanding was unified by presenting facts and reasoning. At this meeting, the plan was basically determined. The third meeting was a small forum of housewives convened around the vacated locations or individual visits were conducted to solicit opinions. When some of the masses had opinions, they were modified according to actual needs and possibilities. After the masses agreed, the final decision could be affirmed, and then adjustments would be made.

As a result of mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses to determine the locations, many problems that the leadership had not considered were also solved. For example, the Fourth Non-staple Food Retail Store on Luomashi Street was originally considered to be removed. After discussion by the masses, it was decided that if it was removed, many residents would have to cross the road, and it would be even more inconvenient to buy things on rainy days, so it was retained according to the opinions of the residents. The Dezhoucheng Non-staple Food Store in the residential area of Meishi Street was originally retained, but the masses' opinion was that the goods were not complete and inconvenient. According to the masses' opinions, the cargo yard was expanded and the variety was increased, which facilitated the masses. In the discussion, the masses mainly raised four questions: first, they were afraid that the goods would not be complete; second, they were afraid that the retail starting point would be high; third, they were afraid of crossing the road to buy things; and fourth, they were afraid that the stores would be far away. Through the adjustment of the commercial network and the reform of operation, these problems have basically been solved.

After the announcement of the plan for the whole district, it was supported by the majority of employees and residents, but some middle-level cadres, employees, and private individuals had conservative ideas and departmentalism.

    北京前门区是怎样调整商业网的
    本报记者　张志清
    北京市全面调整前门区商业网。这次调整商业网是从便利群众出发，根据不同地区不同行业，有增有减的精神来进行的，使商业网分布得更加合理。
  改变不均衡的现象
    前门区是北京市商业集中的地区之一，全区有一千七百多家商店，从业人员有一万三千七百多人。全区平均二十七户居民有一家商店，每十四人中有一个商业人员。这个区商店虽然多，但分布很不均衡，如前门大街设有一百一十六家商店，大栅栏一条街就有五十五家，而且商店重复，如二百九十公尺左右长的大栅栏街，仅服装鞋帽店就有十五家。居民区延寿寺街就有肉铺五家，油盐店八家，而后河沿、海北寺街一片地区却一家商店也没有。由于商店集中的地区商店多，居民区商店少，分布不合理，给群众带来了很多不便。同时职工劳动效率低，也浪费国家资金。经过这次调整后，合理地安排了商业网，改变了过去商店分布不均衡和重复的现象。如和群众生活密切的副食品商店，平均在每两个街道办事处设有一个商品齐全的副食品大商场，同时在每个街道办事处都有两三个综合商店，以及七个到九个一般副食品商店。浴池、饮食业都作了全面安排。这样设置是和当地购卖力水平大体相适应的。管理机构由原来二十六个（包括十个跨区的）合并为百货、副食品、煤建、服务、饮食五个管理机构，全区从业人员较原来减少50％左右，费用水平将由1957年的11.9％减少到6.72％，劳动效率将提高一倍以上，占用的流动资金减少40％，从而加速了资金周转。
    打破行业界限
    这次调整商业网，贯彻了从多方面便利群众的精神。为了彻底解决商业网分布的不合理现象，这次调整中打破了国营、公私合营和行业界限。具体作法是：根据不同地区和不同行业的不同特点，采取不同办法进行调整。
    第一种办法是：为了消除商店重复，便利群众购买，具体作法是变小店为大店，由经营单一商品的商店变为多种商品的综合商店。采取这种办法的主要行业是副食品零售店、日用百货等。如在商业集中的大栅栏，把原来重复的六家百货商店合并为一个大的综合商场。将原来的四家服装店合并为一个较大的服装店。居民区大沟沿原有六个小副食品零售商店，经营的品种都很少，这次合并为一个综合零售商店后，品种由二百零七种增加到一千三百多种。商店合并后，各个商店都有了不同的分工，商品齐全了，群众到一家商店就可以买到许多种商品，不再像以前满街跑了。
    第二种办法是：商店的品种少，但是群众很需要，就可以采取原点不动，以扩大门面增添品种满足群众需要。采用这种办法的主要是国药、理发、饮食、浴池等行业。如大栅栏同仁堂国药店原址不动，扩大了汤剂、饮片，增设了新药专柜，使顾客在这里也可以买到必要的新药。居民区浴池、理发等服务性行业，原点不多，居民很需要，这次对联系群众好、条件好的单位，加以扩充，增加了座位。如全区饮食业，有许多饭馆没有早点和夜宵，这次根据群众需要和现有设备、房屋条件，把原来的饭馆扩大了门面，有九家饭馆增加了早点和夜宵，基本上满足了群众需要。
    第三种办法是：在缺少商店的街道和商店分布不适中的街道，根据当地购买力水平和需要，适当增加新点和迁移。这次调整商业网中新设了商业点四十二个。如商业集中的大栅栏，流动顾客多，非常需要增添一个信托寄售部和茶馆，这次就增添了。居民区茶食胡同和后河沿一带地区没有商店，居民购买商品很不便利，这次新建了综合副食、百货零售店以外，茶食胡同一带还新建了早点铺，方便了居民。在香炉营居民区后青厂一带，这次新设了一个油盐店，使附近十几条街巷的居民感到便利。居民区杨梅竹斜街原有两个副食品商店，一个小副食店在中间，另一个商品多的副食店却设在西头，居民要买东西路远不便，这次把西头的副食品商店迁移到了这条街的正中间，使居民感到便利。
    第四种办法是：对不是群众日常必需的五金、交电、化工、矿油以及钟表、眼镜等行业，这次采取了较大的合并，并集中设在了交通方便的前门大街，便利有关企业、机关和外地顾客。
  保留有特点的商店
    在这次调整中，对于一些确实有经营特点的和特殊需要的商店，都注意了保留和发展。如同仁堂药店、瑞蚨祥布店、内联升鞋店、马聚源帽店、著名的烧麦店都一处等都保留了下来。有的还扩大了门面。对少数民族鞋帽店、食品店也作了妥善的安排。此外，对有些行业本区不需要，全市需要、又有技术人员、有设备的店铺，根据需要跨区迁移。如永安堂国药店迁至东单。
    为了便利顾客，在商业网调整的同时，在经营上还采取了一系列的改进措施。如有的居民区虽然撤点，但是增添了流动售货车，定时、定线、定点串小巷流动供应，将货物送上门去。为了照顾老弱病残，各商店还实行了分片负责，定期预约送货。对机关团体实行了电话送货，有的商店在晚间关门后增设了开窗售货，此外还想出了代顾客加工等方便群众的办法。在布店、百货、副食品等行业中，重新调整了货位，采用了敞开式售货，便利了顾客挑选。
    这次调整商业网，不仅便利了群众，同时也是商业企业本身的一项重大改革。这次改革对全区商业网统一进行了安排，减少了管理机构，加强了企业之间的协作。如全区药材原料加工方面，同仁堂有切片机、磨粉机、打丸机，经常任务不足，设备利用率很低，而庆仁堂药店的加工设备很落后，用小驴拉磨，这次合并到同仁堂加工厂统一加工后，发挥了设备效率，并保证了药材的质量。统一调整商业网后，还解决了长期不能解决的职工生活福利问题，职工们有了休息室、食堂，为执行一班顶到底的售货创造了良好条件，鼓舞了职工们的工作积极性。
    依靠群众定点
    调整前门区商业网，是在整风运动的基础上进行的。广大职工和居民经过整风运动后，社会主义觉悟有了提高，职工们贴了八万多张有关人浮于事、要求并行并店调整商业网的大字报，居民们提出了五万多条有关商业方面的意见。在这种情况下，前门区有关领导部门根据广大职工和居民的意见，组成了工作组进行了对商业网的调查、摸底，然后发动职工群众讨论，让群众定点。具体作法是在商业集中的主要街道的大栅栏、前门大街，首先由工作组根据现场了解的房屋设置，参考过去顾客的习惯，以及销售情况，提出设点意见，交各阶层群众进行讨论，最后订出规划，经过反复修改确定最后方案。
    在居民区，采取了群众定点，三次会议定案的办法。第一次会议向职工同街道居民委员会主任、商业监督员及部分居民，分别把调整商业网的意义和目的向他们交代清楚，分别组织讨论，并请群众自己先提出建点、迁、并的设点意见。第二次会议，工作组根据职工、群众所提意见结合实际调查情况做出调整商店分布图。而后同群众、职工分别进行讨论。在讨论过程中意见不一致时，通过摆事实讲道理的办法统一认识，这次会上基本上订出了方案。第三次会，是在撤点周围召开家庭主妇的小型座谈会或进行个别访问，征求意见，当部分群众有意见时，根据实际需要与可能进行修改，群众同意后就可以肯定最后定案，随后再作调整。
    发动群众，依靠群众定点的结果，有许多领导上考虑不周到的问题也得到了解决。如骡马市大街第四副食品零售店原来考虑要撤掉，经过群众讨论，撤了后，许多居民要过马路，下雨天买东西更不便利，根据居民意见又保留了下来。煤市街居民集中区德骤成副食店，原来保留不动，群众意见是商品不全、不便利，根据群众意见扩大了货场，增加了品种，便利了群众。群众在讨论中，主要提出四个问题：一、怕商品不齐全；二、怕零售起点高；三、怕买东西过马路；四、怕商店离得远。经过商业网的调整和改革经营，基本上得到了解决。
    全区方案公布后，受到了多数职工和居民的拥护，但是也有少数中层干部、职工和私方人员存有保守思想和本位主义。
