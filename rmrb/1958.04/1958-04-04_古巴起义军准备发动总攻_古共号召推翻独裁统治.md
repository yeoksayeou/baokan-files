    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Havana: Cuban rebel forces launched the first phase of their "total war" against the Batista dictatorial regime on the evening of the 1st, and are preparing to launch a general offensive on the 5th.
    The Cuban Communist Party issued a statement on the 2nd supporting the activities of the rebel forces. The statement called on all the Cuban people to rise up and end Batista's tyranny, and to establish a broad-based democratic coalition government composed of people from all strata opposed to the tyranny.
    A spokesman for the Batista government admitted on the 2nd that the government was facing an unprecedentedly serious threat. The spokesman said that the rebel forces had engaged in multiple conflicts with government troops in Oriente Province in eastern Cuba, and had cut off transportation and communication to many cities in Oriente Province. Reports say that Cuba's second largest city, Santiago de Cuba, is virtually "cut off from the outside world." Posters of rebel leader Castro have appeared on the streets of the city, stating that the insurgent people will soon depart from the countryside to attack Santiago.
    In order to maintain their tottering rule, the Batista clique is in a panic. The Cuban Congress announced a state of emergency throughout the country on March 31, and further granted Batista dictatorial powers to deal with the rebel forces. At the same time, the US naval base at Guantanamo (Cuba) has cancelled all leave and taken so-called "preventative" "emergency measures" against the rebel forces. Some American company personnel living in Oriente Province have requested the US Navy to send warships to "protect" them, while US news agencies are constantly spreading rumors that the rebel forces "threaten" US companies.
    It is reported that Dominican President Trujillo, at Batista's "urgent request," has transported five planeloads of weapons and ammunition to the Cuban army.

    古巴起义军准备发动总攻
    古共号召推翻独裁统治
    据新华社3日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴起义部队1日晚上发动了反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的第一阶段的“总体战”，并且准备在5日发动总攻。
    古巴共产党2日发表文告，支持起义部队的活动。文告号召古巴全体人民起来结束巴蒂斯塔的暴政，并且成立一个由反对暴政的各阶层人士组成的广泛的民主联合政府。
    巴蒂斯塔政府发言人2日承认，这个政府面临着空前未有的严重的威胁。发言人说，起义部队已经在古巴东部的奥连特省同政府军发生了多次冲突，并且切断了奥连特省许多城市的交通和电讯往来。有消息说，古巴第二大城古巴圣地亚哥实际上已同“外界断绝”，在这个城市的街道上出现了起义部队领袖卡斯特罗的告示，它说，起义人民不久将从乡下出发攻打圣地亚哥。
    为了要维持摇摇欲坠的统治，巴蒂斯塔集团慌作了一团。古巴议会3月31日宣布全国处于紧急状态，并且进一步授予巴蒂斯塔以应付起义部队的独裁权力。与此同时，在关塔那摩（古巴）的美国海军基地已经取消了一切休假，并且采取了所谓“防范”起义部队的“紧急措施”。住在奥连特省的一些美国公司的人员已经要求美国海军派军舰去“保护”他们，而美国通讯社也不断散布所谓起义部队“威胁”美国公司的消息。
    据报道，多米尼加总统特鲁希略已经应巴蒂斯塔的“紧急要求”，把装满了五架飞机的武器和弹药运送给古巴陆军。
