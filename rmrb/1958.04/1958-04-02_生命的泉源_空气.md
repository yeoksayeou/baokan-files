	The Source of Life – Air
	Si Nan
	The Earth is surrounded by a vast ocean of air, and we live at the bottom of this air ocean. This ocean of air is called the atmosphere, and all animals and plants must rely on it to survive.

	Air is a mixture of many gases, mainly oxygen and nitrogen. In addition, there are small amounts of inert gases – helium, argon, neon, krypton, and xenon. Air also contains some compounds: carbon dioxide, water vapor, etc. Their content in the air varies depending on conditions and is called the variable part of the air.

	Oxygen in the air is the source of life for living things; without it, life cannot be sustained. All animals and plants must breathe. Respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen in the air to carry out chemical reactions in their bodies, producing carbon dioxide and water vapor, which are then discharged, while generating the energy necessary for animal life activities and maintaining body temperature (warm-blooded animals). Plants also carry out metabolic processes to break down old body tissues and create new ones.

	Nitrogen cannot participate in combustion, and organisms cannot use it for respiration, but the fact that air contains 78% nitrogen is also essential for life. It plays a role in diluting oxygen in the air, preventing oxidation from being too violent, otherwise everything would be burned by pure oxygen. Nitrogen is also an important component of proteins in animals and plants.

	Inert gases cannot undergo chemical reactions with any substance, so they are called "inert." Although they have no significance for the life of organisms, they have application value in industry. Filling balloons and airships with some helium can prevent combustion. Neon gas is the raw material for manufacturing neon lights. Argon gas can be used to make high-intensity light bulbs.

	Air is not only of great significance to living things but is also an important raw material for our modern industry. After compression and cooling, air can be made into liquid air, and then pure oxygen and pure nitrogen can be obtained by utilizing the different evaporation abilities of various gases. The temperature of the flame generated when pure oxygen and acetylene (calcium carbide gas) burn is as high as 3,500 degrees Celsius, which is used for metal welding and cutting.

	The application value of nitrogen in the air is even greater. We can directly use air to produce ammonia and nitric acid, which is called "nitrogen fixation" in industry. Ammonia and nitric acid are important raw materials for the dye, explosive, pharmaceutical, and fertilizer industries.

	Air can also be used as a source of power. The flow of air can generate wind, and our ancestors used wind power to turn mills and draw water one or two thousand years ago. In modern times, wind power is used to generate electricity.

	Will the nitrogen and oxygen in the air be reduced due to the respiration of animals and plants and the large-scale application in industry? No, because the oxygen released by plant photosynthesis is twenty times more than the oxygen absorbed by its respiration, which is enough to compensate for the oxygen consumed by animal respiration. Nitrogen can also be compensated for by being produced from the decay of animals and plants and the combustion of plants.

    生命的泉源——空气
    斯南
    地球的周围被一片汪洋大海似的空气包围着，我们就是生活在这个空气海洋的底部。这片空气海洋叫做大气，一切动物和植物都必须依靠它来活命。
    空气，是许多气体的混合物，其中主要是氧气和氮气。除此以外，还有少量的惰性气体——氦气、氩气、氖气、氪气和氙气等。空气中还含有一些化合物：二氧化碳、水蒸气等。它们在空气中的含量随条件而异，称为空气中的可变部分。
    空气中的氧气是生物生命的源泉，没有它生命就无法维持。一切动物和植物都必须进行呼吸，呼吸作用就是生物利用空气中的氧在体内进行化学作用产生碳酸气和水蒸气排出体外，同时产生供给动物生活活动和保持体温（热血动物）所必需的能量。植物也因而进行了代谢作用破坏旧体素添造新体素。
    氮气不能参与燃烧，生物也不能用它来进行呼吸，但是空气中含有78％的氮气也是生命所必不可缺少的。它在空气中起着冲淡氧气的作用，使氧化作用不致过于剧烈，否则一切将被纯氧烧毁。氮素还是动植物体内蛋白质的重要成分。
    惰性气体不能与任何物质进行化学作用，所以被称为“惰性”。它对生物的生命虽无意义，但在工业上却有应用价值。在气球、飞船内灌入一些氦气，可以防止燃烧。氖气是制造霓虹灯的原料。氩气可以用来制造高强度的灯泡。
    空气不仅对生物有着巨大的意义，也是我们近代工业的重要原料，空气经过压缩、冷却以后能制成液态空气，再利用各种气体蒸发能力的不同而使之分离，这样便制得纯氧和纯氮。纯氧和乙炔（电石气）燃烧时所生成火焰的温度高达摄氏三千五百度，应用于金属的焊接和剖切。
    空气中的氮气应用价值更大，我们能直接用空气制造氨（阿莫尼亚）和硝酸，这在工业上称之为“氮的固定”。氨和硝酸是染料、炸药、药品，肥料工业的重要原料。
    空气还能作为动力的来源。空气的流动可以产生风，我们的祖先在一、二千年前就已经利用风力来推磨和戽水。近代更利用风力来发电。
    空气中的氮和氧会不会因为动植物的呼吸作用和工业上的大量应用减少呢？不会，因为植物的光合作用所放出的氧气比它的呼吸作用所吸收的氧气多二十倍，足够补偿动物的呼吸作用消耗掉的氧。氮气也能从动植物的腐烂和植物的燃烧中产生而得以补偿。
