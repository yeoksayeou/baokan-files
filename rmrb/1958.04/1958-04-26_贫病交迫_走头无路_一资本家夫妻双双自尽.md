Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 25th: According to Taiwanese and Hong Kong newspapers, amidst a chorus of bankruptcies among industrial and commercial businesses in Taiwan, Xu Hongheng, a national capitalist living in Taipei, was forced into a dead end. Unable to return to the mainland, he and his wife committed suicide by taking poison.

Xu Hongheng was from Zhejiang Province. In 1949, he and his wife brought $100,000 to Taiwan to engage in the textile industry, opening the Taipei Textile Company. Under the heavy tax squeeze of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and American economic plunder, in less than seven years, they completely lost their capital. Xu Hongheng had to transfer all his shares in the company to others, becoming an employee within the company himself. Recently, this company was also on the verge of collapse, and Xu Hongheng faced the threat of unemployment. Because his children and relatives were all on the mainland, he boldly applied to the Taiwan Provincial Security Headquarters of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to leave Taiwan and return to his hometown to find his relatives, using the reason that he had no support in Taiwan. His application was rejected several times, and his wife was seriously ill. The couple, trapped in Taiwan, were plagued by poverty and illness, with no way out. On April 20th, they took a large number of sleeping pills and committed suicide together. In his will, he instructed his nephew to cremate the bodies of him and his wife, put the ashes in one box, and "throw them outside Keelung Harbor, so that the roaring ocean waves can send the ashes to the mainland hometown on the other side," so as to fulfill his lifelong wish to return to the mainland after death. Xu Hongheng also said in his will to his colleagues at the Taipei Textile Company: "In the afterlife, I will secretly bless you, that your future is bright, and that you can return to the mainland." The words are extremely tragic.

In recent years, the Taiwanese residents' longing for the mainland has become even more urgent. Because the Chiang Kai-shek clique strictly prohibits residents from leaving Taiwan, tragic incidents of suicide due to the inability to return to the mainland to meet relatives and friends for a long time often occur in Taiwan.

### 贫病交迫　走头无路  一资本家夫妻双双自尽

    贫病交迫　走头无路
    一资本家夫妻双双自尽
    新华社广州25日电　据台湾、香港报纸报道，在台湾工商业户一片倒闭声中，住在台北市的民族资本家徐鸿恒被逼得走投无路，欲归大陆不得，夫妻双双服毒自杀。
    徐鸿恒是浙江人，1949年夫妇二人带了十万美元到台湾经营纺织业，开设了台北纺织公司。在蒋介石集团的重税压榨和美国经济掠夺下，不到七年光景，把资本完全亏光。徐鸿恒只好把他在这家公司所有的股权转让给别人，自己在公司内当一个职员。近来这个公司又将倒闭，徐鸿恒面临失业的威胁。他因儿女亲属都在大陆，就以在台湾生活无依为理由，大着胆子向蒋介石集团台湾省保安司令部请求离开台湾，以便回家乡找寻亲属。他好几次申请都被拒绝，而妻子又身患重病，两夫妇沦落在台湾，贫病交迫，无路可走，在4月20日一同服大量安眠药片自杀死去。遗书嘱他的侄儿把他夫妇二人的遗体焚化，骨灰同装一匣，“抛于基隆港外，好让滔滔汪洋怒潮，把骨灰送至对岸大陆故乡”，以便死后了却生前日夜想回大陆的心愿。徐鸿恒在写给台北纺织公司同事的遗书中也说：“在九泉之下，暗中会庇护你们，前途光明，得回大陆。”词句十分凄惨。
    近年来台湾居民思念大陆的心情更加殷切。由于蒋介石集团严禁居民离开台湾，长期因想回大陆会晤亲友不得以致自杀的惨事在台湾常常发生。
