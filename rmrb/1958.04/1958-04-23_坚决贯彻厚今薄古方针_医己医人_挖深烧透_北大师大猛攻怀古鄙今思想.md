    This newspaper reports that faculty and students from the Chinese, History, and Philosophy departments of Peking University, and the Education Department of Peking Normal University, are fiercely attacking the phenomenon of valuing the past over the present in teaching and scientific research. Teachers are bravely exposing and criticizing their own academic ideas of cherishing the past, belittling the present, clinging to the old and refusing the new, and are determined to break free from the piles of old paper, implement the policy of valuing the present over the past, and strive to be both red and expert.

    Many big-character posters in these two schools reveal that many teachers have serious ideas of valuing the past over the present, cherishing the past and belittling the present, and in lectures "talk at length about the ancient and foreign, and briefly describe the present and Chinese." Some teachers in the Chinese Department of Peking University spent two hours lecturing on Cao Cao's lines "Old steed in the stable, ambition in a thousand miles; the hero in his twilight years, his heart is still strong," single-mindedly pursuing abstract artistic conceptions without making any criticisms; they even talked about the "moon" in "Qin Dynasty Moon Han Dynasty Pass" for an hour, while only skimming over Bai Juyi's folk-style poems, which are rich in popular appeal. Some teachers lecturing open their mouths with Anna Karenina and close them with Dream of the Red Chamber, never talking about modern works. Some teachers lecturing on literary history are enthusiastic about textual research and book versions, talking animatedly about what paper ancient books were printed on, what thread was used to bind them, and how wide the top and bottom margins were. He also told students: "Whoever can figure out the authenticity of the Ancient Text and Modern Text Book of Documents, a position on the Academic Committee will be no problem." A teacher in the History Department told students: Chronology, geography, official positions, and catalogs are the four keys to learning Chinese history, but there is no key of Marxism-Leninism. He guided students to make chronologies of historical figures, listing twenty kinds of ancient books but not a single work of Marxism-Leninism. An associate professor in the department spent four hours listing the nineteen daughters of Emperor Gaozu and the twenty-one daughters of Emperor Taizong who married imperial consorts, examining their family backgrounds one by one. When teaching "National Education System," a teacher in the Education Department of Beijing Normal University spent about ten class periods talking about the "ancient" and "foreign" in great detail, and also introduced more than twenty relevant reference books. Later, at the request of the students, he only used about one class period to talk about the new Chinese school system. Some teachers even used the ancient to criticize the present, using feudal and bourgeois ideological viewpoints to forcibly interpret communist pedagogy. When he lectured on "The Aims and Tasks of Communist Education," he actually quoted the poem "Li Bai composes a hundred poems with a flagon of wine, sleeps in a wineshop on the Chang'an marketplace, the emperor calls him but he does not board the boat, claiming to be a wine immortal," to illustrate the relationship between moral and aesthetic education, etc. This not only distorted the essence of scientific pedagogy and communist moral qualities, but also misinterpreted the original meaning of these old poems and ancient sayings.

    Teachers are not only valuing the past over the present, cherishing the past and belittling the present, detailing the ancient and omitting the present, but also valuing capitalism and idealism, and belittling socialism and materialism. A teacher in the Philosophy Department of Peking University openly said to people: "Idealism itself has good things, I have feelings for idealism, I can divorce my wife, but I can't divorce idealism." He proposed "to fight for a higher evaluation of idealism." He instructed a graduate student to read more works of classical bourgeois idealist philosophers. In the teaching of the history of world education in the Education Department of Beijing Normal University, teachers spent a year and a half talking about the history of European education, introducing many bourgeois educators such as Locke, Rousseau, Comenius, etc., while only three educators were discussed in the history of Soviet education, and the famous Soviet educator Makarenko was only lectured on for one class period.

    Valuing the past over the present is also manifested in serious detachment from reality and neglect or contempt for current political struggles. In the Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of the Philosophy Department of Peking University, thirty-five papers studied ancient issues in five and a half years, nineteen studied modern issues, and there was not a single paper studying modern issues. A professor in the Literary Theory Teaching and Research Section of the Chinese Department asked graduate students and teaching assistants to copy the "Book of Songs" one by one, and to copy the annotations without missing a word, while remaining indifferent to the current struggles in the literary world. Professor Gao Mingkai and six others from the Chinese Department said in big-character posters that their research was each doing their own special topics. They believe that some major issues raised in modern language practice (such as language reform, standardization of Chinese, and promotion of Mandarin) are not of much value, and few people conduct research and exploration on them. A teacher in the Chinese Department instructed graduate students, "Don't pay too much attention to the discussions in current magazines." And said: "Learning must be distanced from real struggles, and cannot always be combined with practice." Some teachers in the Education Department of Beijing Normal University promoted typical scholar-bureaucrat lofty ideas to students, emphasizing that studying should be "indifferent to fame and fortune to clarify one's ambitions, and tranquility to achieve far-reaching goals," therefore, requiring students to "read books behind closed doors." On the other hand, they did not pay much attention to the Party's education policies and the educational reality of New China.

    This kind of valuing the past over the present, cherishing the past and belittling the present, detailing the ancient and omitting the present, and other various ideas, lead students into the piles of old paper, leading them to detachment from reality, detachment from political struggle, and extremely serious individualism and fame-seeking thoughts, and the dangerous situation of extreme decadence and grayness of thought and emotion. Most of the students in the third grade class two of the Philosophy Department of Peking University are willing to engage in ancient things, such as sorting out ancient books, researching ancient medical problems, and some even want to study alchemy. Many students in the Chinese Department despise the achievements of new literature, despise worker-peasant-soldier literature, and believe that only classical literature is worth studying hard, has high artistry, is "strong tea," and has a taste to savor. One student planned to study Yuan opera and become a Yuan opera expert, and felt that it was hopeless to be assigned to work as a middle school teacher after graduation. Some students were assigned to work as teaching assistants in the history of new literature, but were unwilling to do so, and instead studied Li Bai in their dormitory. After some students learned Zhuangzi and Tao Yuanming, they became detached from reality, avoided struggle, and fostered unhealthy thoughts and emotions. Some students in the History Department envied the professors for receiving high manuscript fees, and therefore "turned a deaf ear to outside affairs" and buried themselves in reading ancient books. Some people even openly proposed "historical materialism" to oppose the study of Marxist-Leninist theory.

    After these serious phenomena were exposed, many teachers were awakened, and they further exposed each other and helped each other with a positive attitude of curing themselves and others, and treating diseases and saving people. They deeply felt that they must resolutely implement the policy of valuing the present over the past, and strive to be both red and expert. At present, they are starting to improve the teaching content and teaching methods of some courses.

    坚决贯彻厚今薄古方针
    医己医人　挖深烧透
    北大师大猛攻怀古鄙今思想
    本报讯　北京大学中文、历史、哲学等系和北京师范大学教育系师生猛攻教学和科学研究中的厚古薄今现象。教师们勇敢地揭露批判自己学术上怀古鄙今、抱残守缺的思想，决心跳出故纸堆，贯彻厚今薄古方针，力争又红又专。
    这两个学校的许多大字报揭发，不少教师存在着严重的厚古薄今、怀古鄙今的思想，在讲课中“纵谈古外，略述今中”。北京大学中文系有的教师用两小时讲曹操的“老马伏枥，志在千里，烈士暮年，壮心不已”诗句，一味追求抽象的意境，不作任何批判；对“秦时明月汉时关”的“月”字，竟讲一小时之久，而对富有人民性的白居易的乐府诗，只一掠而过。有的教师讲课，开口安娜卡列尼娜，闭口红楼梦，从不讲现代作品。有的教师讲文学史，对考据、书的版本津津乐道，对古书用什么纸印，用什么线订，上下天地有多宽，谈得眉飞色舞。他还对学生说：“谁能把今古文尚书的真伪搞清楚，那学部委员是不成问题的。”历史系有的教师对学生说：年代、地理、官职、目录是学习中国史的四把钥匙，就是没有马克思列宁主义这把钥匙。他指导学生做历史人物年表，开列了二十种古籍书目，而没有一本马克思列宁主义著作。该系一位副教授用四个小时列举高祖女十九人和太宗女二十一人所尚驸马，逐一地考证其家世。北京师范大学教育系有位教师讲授“国民教育制度”时，用十节课左右的时间把“古”“外”讲得淋漓尽致，还介绍了二十多本有关的参考书，后来在学生的要求下，才只用了约一节课的时间讲了讲新中国的学制。有的教师还以古代今，用封建的、资产阶级的思想观点，牵强附会地解释共产主义教育学。他在讲“共产主义教育目的和任务”时，竟引用“李白斗酒诗百篇，长安市上酒家眠，天子呼来不上船，自称臣是酒中仙”的诗来说明德育同美育的关系等等。这不但歪曲了科学的教育学和共产主义道德品质的本质，也曲解这些旧诗古语的原意。
    教师们不但厚古薄今、怀古鄙今、详古略今，而且还厚资本主义、唯心主义，薄社会主义、唯物主义。北京大学哲学系有一位教师公开对人说：“唯心主义本身有好东西，我对唯心主义就是有感情，和老婆离婚可以，可是和唯心主义离不了。”他提出“要为更高的评价唯心论而斗争”。他教导一位研究生多读古典的资产阶级唯心主义哲学家的著作。北京师范大学教育系在世界教育史的讲授中，教师以一年半的时间讲欧洲教育史，介绍了许多资产阶级的教育家如洛克、卢梭、夸美纽斯等等，而苏维埃教育史只讲了三个教育家，著名的苏联教育家马卡连柯只用了一节课的时间讲授。
    厚古薄今还表现为严重的脱离实际、忽视或轻视当前的政治斗争。北京大学哲学系中国哲学史教研室五年半中有三十五篇论文研究古代问题，有十九篇研究近代问题而研究现代问题的论文一篇也没有。中文系文艺理论教研室的一位教授要研究生、助教把“诗经”一首首抄下来，注解也一字不漏地抄下来，而对当前文艺界的斗争却漠不关心。中文系高名凯教授等七人在大字报中说，他们的研究是各人搞各人的专题。他们认为现代语言实际中提出的一些重大问题（如文字改革，汉语规范化，推广普通话等）没有多大价值，很少有人对它进行研究和探讨。中文系有位教师教导研究生，“不要过多注意当前杂志上的讨论”。并且说：“学习就得跟现实斗争有距离，不能够老结合实际。”北京师范大学教育系有的教师向学生宣扬典型的士大夫的清高思想，强调治学应该“淡泊以明志，宁静以致远”，因此，要求学生“闭门读书”。另一方面他们对党的教育政策和新中国的教育实际却不大关心。
    这种厚古薄今、怀古鄙今、详古略今等等形形色色的思想，把学生引导到故纸堆里，引导到脱离实际、脱离政治斗争，个人主义名利思想极为严重，思想感情极端颓废灰色的危险境地。北京大学哲学系三年级二班大部分学生愿意搞古东西，如古籍整理工作，古代医学问题研究，甚至有人想去研究炼金术。中文系不少学生轻视新文学的成就，轻视工农兵文艺，认为只有古典文学，才值得下功夫去研究，艺术性高，是“浓茶”，有味道可品。一位学生打算研究元曲，当元曲专家，毕业分配去作中学教师就认为没有前途。有的学生被分配作新文学史助教，不愿意干，却在自己宿舍里搞李白。有一些学生学了庄子和陶渊明之后，就变得脱离现实，逃避斗争，滋长了不健康的思想感情。历史系有的学生，羡慕教授稿费拿的多，因而“两耳不闻窗外事”，埋头读古书。甚至有人公开提出“史料唯物论”来反对学习马克思列宁主义理论。
    这些严重现象被揭发以后，许多教师都猛醒过来，他们抱着医己医人，治病救人的积极态度，进一步相互揭发、相互帮助，他们深切地感到必须坚决贯彻厚今薄古的方针，力争红透专深。目前他们正着手改进一些课程的教学内容和教学方法。
