Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 2nd: Signs of the worsening U.S. economic recession are emerging in all aspects.

According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, U.S. steel production continues to fall. Last week, the U.S. steel industry's operating rate was estimated to be less than 50%, falling to the lowest point since July 1949. Automobile production has also decreased significantly. According to a United Press report on April 1st, the production volume of the three major U.S. automobile manufacturers in March decreased by more than 20% compared with the same month in 1957. Among them, Ford Motor Company decreased by about 50%, and General Motors decreased by 23%.

The number of unemployed workers continues to increase. Although the number of unemployed workers nationwide in March has not yet been announced, U.S. Secretary of Labor Mitchell has already admitted that it will exceed the level of February.

According to some news agencies, some large companies such as "General Electric Company," "Westinghouse Electric Corporation," and "General Motors Corporation" will continue to lay off large numbers of workers in April.

In the past, the downward trend in the U.S. sales sector was not obvious, but now the situation has changed. The Federal Reserve Board's monthly report shows that even considering the usual seasonal changes, department store sales in February still fell significantly. At the same time, the upward trend of installment purchase credit has also stopped for the first time since 1954.

Meanwhile, according to official statistics, due to sluggish business, the number of bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises in the United States in February reached 1,238, an increase of 8% compared with February last year, which is the highest level for February of each year since 1933.

Some American journalists admitted in their reports that they originally expected the U.S. economic recession to reach a "turning point" in April and see a "recovery," but now it seems that this "recovery" has not arrived.

    美国经济衰退毫无起色
    工业生产继续下降　失业人数有增无已
    据新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国经济衰退病症不断加重的征象正在各方面表露出来。
    据美国钢铁研究所报道，美国钢铁产量继续下跌，上星期美国钢铁业开工率估计不到50％，降到1949年7月以来的最低点。汽车生产也大大下降。据合众社1日报道，美国三大汽车制造公司3月份生产量比1957年同月减少都在20％以上，其中福特汽车公司约减少了50％，通用汽车公司减少23％。
    失业工人继续在增加。虽然3月份全国失业工人人数还没有公布，美国劳工部长密契尔已经承认，这将超过2月份的水平。
    据一些通讯社报道，一些大公司如“通用电气公司”、“威斯汀豪斯电气公司”、“通用汽车公司”等4月份还要继续大批解雇工人。
    在过去一个时候，美国销售部门的下降趋势还是不明显的，但是现在情况已经有所改变。美国联邦储备委员会的每月报告表明，甚至考虑到通常的季节性变化的因素，2月份百货公司的销售额仍是大大下降的。同时，分期付款购货的信贷的上升趋势也从1954年以来第一次中止了。
    同时，据官方统计，由于生意清淡，2月份美国中小企业破产的数目高达一千二百三十八家，比去年2月增加了8％，是1933年以来每年2月份的最高水平。
    一些美国记者在报道中承认，他们原先预期美国经济衰退将在4月份达到“转折点”而出现“恢复”，现在看来这个“恢复”并没有到来。
