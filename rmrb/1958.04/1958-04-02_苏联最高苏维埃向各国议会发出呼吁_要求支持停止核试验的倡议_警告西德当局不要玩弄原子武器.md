Xinhua News Agency, April 1st dispatch from Moscow: According to TASS, on March 31st, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided to entrust the chairmen of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities, in the name of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, to issue an appeal to the parliaments of the countries that participated in the anti-Hitler alliance and those that suffered from Hitler's aggression during World War II, calling on them to work together to stop the Federal Republic of Germany from being armed with atomic and rocket weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st dispatch from Moscow: According to TASS, on March 31st, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union adopted an appeal to the United States Congress, the British Parliament, and the parliaments of all countries regarding the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear testing, requesting them to support the Soviet initiative to stop nuclear testing.

The appeal to the United States Congress stated that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union firmly believes that the solution to the problem of stopping nuclear weapons testing depends primarily on an agreement between the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain. If the United States and Great Britain, which possess nuclear weapons, also respond to the Soviet decision by stopping the testing of such weapons, then the issue of a universal cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing will be permanently resolved. This is an important step towards stopping the expansion of atomic armaments and strengthening the security of all peoples. This step is of great significance for the normalization of the overall international situation and will also promote the resolution of many other outstanding international issues.

The appeal also stated that, of course, if other countries are unwilling to respond to this humane decision of the Soviet Union and continue to test atomic and hydrogen weapon explosions, then, for the sake of the security of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government will act freely on the issue of conducting nuclear tests in the Soviet Union.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union requests the United States Congress to support this initiative, which is in line with the wishes of millions upon millions of people around the world, for the benefit of all mankind.

The appeal to the British Parliament stated that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union hopes that its appeal will receive a response and support from the British Parliament, and that British public opinion and influential political figures will also support the proposal to immediately stop nuclear testing.

The appeal to the parliaments of other countries stated that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is deeply convinced that the immediate cessation of testing such weapons by all countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons is in the interests of all countries in the world, large and small, regardless of whether they possess atomic weapons. The deadly effects of nuclear testing are not limited by geographical boundaries, nor do they understand the political differences between countries. Therefore, every country should clearly define its attitude towards the issue of stopping such testing. Every country—whether it is a large country or a small country, and whether it is a member of the United Nations or not—can greatly help to reach an agreement on stopping nuclear weapons testing and support the demand for an immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen bomb testing.

Xinhua News Agency, March 31st dispatch from Moscow: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union sent a letter to the Federal Council of the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the Soviet Union's decision to cease nuclear weapons testing. This letter warns West German authorities not to play with atomic weapons.

The letter states that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union considers it necessary to declare that the implementation of the resolution to arm the Federal Defense Forces with atomic and rocket weapons, as well as the intention to allow the establishment of foreign atomic and rocket bases on West German territory, make the situation in Europe very similar to the situation when Hitler's Germany began preparing for World War II. However, do not forget that the result of that war was the most tragic disaster in German history. If the Federal Republic of Germany now attempts to embark on the path of military adventure again, then for it, this would be tantamount to national suicide.

The letter states that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union reminds the Federal Council that the Soviet government has expressed its readiness to undertake the solemn obligation to respect the status of a nuclear-free zone and considers that the countries within this zone, namely the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, are not within the scope of the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and rocket weapons. If the policy of arming the Federal Republic of Germany with atomic weapons is implemented, then, in the event of a military conflict, West Germany will inevitably be in a situation where its territory will be destroyed by rocket-atomic warfare and only an uninhabited wasteland will remain.

West Germany being armed with atomic weapons violates the unanimous demand of the people of all countries to free all mankind from the threat of atomic war. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is willing to do everything possible to inform the members of the highest legislative body of the Federal Republic of Germany of the truth that the implementation of measures to atomic arm West Germany will bring many dangers, and you will be responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. The letter says that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is issuing an appeal to the Federal Council out of the desire that the Soviet people and the German people should work together for peace and for the security of the peoples of Europe, including the German people.

    苏联最高苏维埃向各国议会发出呼吁
    要求支持停止核试验的倡议
    警告西德当局不要玩弄原子武器
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃3月31日决定委托联盟院和民族院主席以苏联最高苏维埃的名义，向反希特勒联盟参加国和在第二次世界大战年代遭受希特勒侵略的国家的议会发出呼吁，呼吁它们共同努力来制止以原子武器和火箭武器武装德意志联邦共和国。
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃3月31日就苏联决定单方面停止核试验通过了致美国国会、英国议会和各国议会的呼吁书，要求它们支持苏联关于停止核试验的倡议。
    致美国国会呼吁书说，苏联最高苏维埃坚信，停止核武器试验这个问题的解决首先取决于苏联、美国和英国之间达成协议。如果拥有核武器的美国和英国也以停止试验这种武器来响应苏联的决定，那末，普遍停止原子武器和氢武器试验的问题将获得永久的解决。这是走向停止扩充原子军备和加强各国人民安全的重要步骤。这一步骤对整个国际局势的正常化有很大意义，也将促进其他许多悬而未决的国际问题获得解决。
    这封呼吁书还说，当然，如果其他国家不愿响应苏联这一人道的决定，仍然继续试验原子武器和氢武器的爆炸，那末，为了苏联的安全起见，苏联政府将在苏联进行核试验问题上自由行动。
    苏联最高苏维埃要求美国国会为了全人类的利益支持这一符合世界各国千千万万人的愿望的倡议。
    致英国议会的呼吁书说，苏联最高苏维埃希望它的呼吁能得到英国议会的响应和支持，希望英国的舆论和有影响的政界人士也支持立即停止核试验的建议。
    致其他各国议会的呼吁书说，苏联最高苏维埃深信，一切拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家立即停止试验这种武器是符合世界一切大小国家的利益的，不论它们是否拥有原子武器。核试验的致命影响既不受地理界限的限制，也不懂得各国政治上的分歧。因此每个国家都应当明确它对停止这种试验问题的态度。每一个国家——不论它是大国还是小国，也不论它是不是联合国会员国，都能对达成关于停止核武器试验的协议给以极大的帮助，支持关于立即停止原子弹和氢弹试验的要求。
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3月31日讯：苏联最高苏维埃就苏联决定停止核武器试验一事给德意志联邦共和国联邦议院一封信。这封信警告西德当局不要玩弄原子武器。
    这封信说，苏联最高苏维埃认为必须声明：实现以原子武器和火箭武器武装联邦国防军的决议以及打算允许在西德境内建立外国原子基地和火箭基地的做法，都使欧洲局势同当年希特勒德国开始准备第二次世界大战时的局势十分相似。但是，不要忘记，那次战争的结果是德国历史上最惨重的一次灾祸。如果德意志联邦共和国现在又企图走上军事冒险的道路，那末对它来说，这就等于民族自杀。
    这封信说，苏联最高苏维埃提醒联邦议院注意：苏联政府表示准备承担起庄严的义务，尊重无原子地区的地位并认为这一地区内的国家，即德意志联邦共和国、德意志民主共和国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克不在使用原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器的范围之内。如果以原子武器武装德意志联邦共和国的方针得以实现，那末，一旦发生军事冲突，西德就难免要处在它的领土受火箭—原子战争的摧毁和结果只剩下一片无人的荒土的境地。
    西德用原子武器武装起来，这是违背各国人民希望使全人类免于原子战争威胁的一致要求的。苏联最高苏维埃愿意尽一切方法使德意志联邦共和国最高立法机关议员知道这样一条真理，即实现原子武装西德的措施将带来许多危险，而你们要对由此所引起的后果负一切责任。这封信说，苏联最高苏维埃向联邦议院发出呼吁是出于这样一种愿望：苏联人民和德国人民应该为和平、为欧洲各国人民（其中包括德国人民在内）的安全而共同努力。
