    Xiamen University Nanyang Institute Holds First Scientific Discussion Meeting
    The Nanyang Institute of Xiamen University held its first scientific discussion meeting from the 7th to the 12th.
    A total of seven scientific papers were discussed at the meeting. The proposal of Xiamen University President Wang Yanan's paper, "Contemporary Bourgeois Economic Theory - The Revolutionary and Scientific Tasks of Critiquing Keynesianism," is of great significance for Nanyang problem researchers to understand problems and identify materials. This paper was written in view of the fact that almost 99% of the contemporary foreign materials obtained in the study of Nanyang issues use the British Keynesian theory as a guiding ideology. The late Professor Lin Huixiang, an expert in archeology, anthropology, and ethnology in our country, argued in his paper "The Relationship Between the Nanyang Malay People and the Ancient Ethnic Groups of South China" for the "Sino-Malay Origin Theory," shattering the conspiracy of bourgeois scholars to describe the Malay nation as coming from the West. Professor Tian Rukang's proposal and discussion of "The Stages of Modern Overseas Chinese History" will greatly help the future research of Nanyang Overseas Chinese history. Professor He Qiyuan's "Natural Changes in the Overseas Chinese Population in Malaya," Professor Tian Rukang's "Overseas Chinese Company Organizations in West Kalimantan from the Late Eighteenth Century to the Late Nineteenth Century in Fujian," Professor Zhuang Weiji's "Investigation Report on the History of Overseas Chinese in Jinjiang Prefecture," and Han Zhenhua's "On the Nature of Zheng He's Voyages to the West" also provided a lot of scientific research materials and arguments on related issues.
    Experts participating in this scientific discussion held heated discussions on the above papers. (The three news items in this column are all Xinhua News Agency manuscripts.)

    厦门大学南洋研究所举行第一次科学讨论会
    厦门大学南洋研究所在7日到12日举行了第一次科学讨论会。
    在会上讨论的科学论文共有七篇。厦门大学校长王亚南的“当代资产阶级经济学说——凯因斯学说批判的革命任务和科学任务”这篇论文的提出，对于南洋问题研究工作者认识问题、鉴别材料有重要意义。这篇论文是鉴于研究南洋问题所得到的当代国外材料中，几乎99％是用英国凯因斯学说作为指导思想而写出来的。已故我国考古学、人类学、民族学专家林惠祥教授的“南洋马来族与华南古民族的关系”，论证了“中马同源论”，粉碎了资产阶级学者企图把马来亚民族说成是来自西方的阴谋。田汝康教授的“近代华侨史阶段问题”的提出及讨论，对今后的南洋华侨史研究有很大的帮助。何启援教授的“马来亚华侨人口的自然变动”，田汝康教授的“福建十八世纪末期至十九世纪末期西加里曼丹的华侨公司组织”，庄为玑教授的“晋江专区华侨史调查报告”及韩振华的“论郑和下西洋的性质”等，也都就有关问题提供了不少科学研究材料和论据。
    参加这次科学讨论的专家，对上述论文展开了热烈的讨论。（这一栏的三条新闻均为新华社稿）
