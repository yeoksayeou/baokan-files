Xinhua News Agency, April 9th.

    The head of the Second Commercial Department told Xinhua News Agency reporters today regarding the issue of wild plant materials that in China's vast territory, especially in the mountainous regions that account for more than two-thirds of the country's land area, wild plants are inexhaustible resources. If these wild resources can be fully utilized, they will play a significant role in accelerating the development of local industries, supporting agricultural mechanization, promoting the economy of mountainous areas, and improving the lives of farmers.

    The head stated that preliminary investigations indicate that there are more than a thousand types of important wild plant materials in China. The ones that have been discovered can be roughly categorized into wild fibers, wild oilseeds, wild starches, wild chemical raw materials, and medicinal materials. Currently, only a small portion of these wild plant materials are being utilized, with the majority remaining untapped. The total value of wild plant materials nationwide has not yet been fully determined, but it is certain that the potential is substantial. According to a recent preliminary investigation in Badong County, Hubei Province, the total value of all wild plant materials in this county could be exchanged for more than 1,600 five-horsepower portable steam engines.

    The head stated that, based on two years of operational experience, wild plants, whether bark, roots, vines, or grasses, all contain fiber. Fibers that are long and strong can be used to make rayon, ramie, or batting for spinning, while fibers that are short and weak can be used for papermaking. If seeds and fruits do not contain starch, they contain fat; if they cannot be used for brewing, they can be used for oil extraction, and some can even be made into valuable fragrances. Fibers made from tree bark, grass, and wild hemp can not only replace cotton as batting, but some varieties, after technical processing, can also be spun and woven into various exquisite and high-quality textiles. The significance of utilizing these wild plant fibers is self-evident, especially considering that the growth rate of cotton production in China currently cannot keep up with the growth rate of people's needs. In Sichuan Province alone, if the more than one hundred types of wild plants that have been discovered are utilized, it is estimated that the annual output of fiber could reach six million dan. This year, the province plans to use wild fiber to process 150,000 dan of rayon, and it plans to produce 2.5 million dan by 1960, which is equivalent to 1.6 times the province's cotton production in 1957. This shows that there is great potential in using wild fiber as a substitute.

    Among wild plant oilseeds, 225 types have been successfully tested and can be used for paint, ink, soap, hardened oil, lighting, car wiping, etc., and some can even be eaten. Litsea cubeba is mainly used to make volatile oil, and cubeba oil is a raw material for high-grade fragrances, with a price of 24,000 yuan per ton. In the past, China had to import 40 tons annually from abroad. Since the successful discovery of Litsea cubeba oil extraction in 1955, after two years of utilization, imports began to be replaced by exports in 1957.

    Among wild starches and alternative raw materials for brewing, there are more than ten types with high yields and utilization rates. Acorns contain more than 50% starch, and every 100 jin can produce about 50 jin of 60-proof baijiu. Sophora japonica beans, which were previously only used as feed, have been proven through trial production to be able to extract rutin, a drug for treating high blood pressure. Sophora japonica beans can also be used to make soy sauce, vinegar, wine, maltose, etc., and the by-products can still be used as feed.

    Red roots, acorn cups, Dioscorea cirrhosa, and oak bark in wild plants are all good raw materials for tannin extract. Three tons of red roots or acorn cups can extract one ton of tannin extract. The cost of red root tannin extract is more than 1,000 yuan per ton, and the cost of acorn cup tannin extract is more than 700 yuan per ton. If these products are utilized, they can save the country a considerable amount of foreign exchange each year.

    The head said that wild plants are not weeds when unused, but treasures when used. How can they be fully utilized? First, relevant departments, especially commercial departments, must dispel concerns about losing money, stockpiling, and trouble from their minds, establish a positive view of developing production, and recognize the significant importance of collecting and utilizing wild plant materials for developing local industries, supporting agricultural mechanization, and promoting the economy of mountainous areas, thereby proactively surveying resources, helping agricultural cooperatives formulate production plans, and organizing mass production. Because wild plants grow very scattered, have many varieties, and have strong seasonality, it is necessary to closely rely on the masses, widely publicize, organize mass technical instruction, and rationally arrange labor. Only by mobilizing the broad masses can the scattered wild plant materials be collected. Therefore, the collection of wild plant materials is not only an economic task but also a mass work. At the same time, it also requires close cooperation between industrial, scientific, technological research, and other relevant departments with commercial departments to conduct more trials, use more trials, expand processing, and widely utilize them. The more they are used, the more they can promote the development and reproduction of wild plants.

    不用是草　用起来是宝
    第二商业部负责人谈野生植物资源
    新华社9日讯　第二商业部负责人就野生植物原料问题今天对新华社记者说，在我国辽阔的土地上，特别是占全国土地面积三分之二以上的山区，满山遍野的野生植物是取之不尽的资源。这些野生资源如能充分加以利用，对加速地方工业发展、支援农业机械化、繁荣山区经济、改善农民生活等方面有极重大的作用。
    这位负责人说，据初步调查，我国重要野生植物原料有一千多种。现在已发现的大致有野生纤维、野生油料、野生淀粉、野生化工原料和药材等类。目前这些野生植物原料被利用的只是一小部分，大部分还没有利用起来。全国野生植物原料的总值究竟有多大？现在还没有查清，但肯定这潜力是很大的。仅据最近湖北省巴东县的初步调查，这个县的全部野生植物原料的总值，可以换到五马力的锅驼机一千六百多部。
    这位负责人说，经过两年来的经营证明，野生植物中凡是皮、根、藤、草都含有纤维，纤维长、拉力强的可制人造棉、人造麻或弹絮纺纱，纤维短、拉力弱的可供造纸。凡是籽、实不含淀粉就含脂肪，不能酿酒便能榨油，有的还可制成高贵的香料。用树皮、草、野麻制成的纤维，不仅可以代替棉花作絮棉，而且其中有些品种经过技术加工，还可以纺织，制成各种精美优良的纺织品。这些野生植物纤维的利用，在我国目前棉花生产增长速度还赶不上人民需要增长速度的情况下，其意义可以想见。仅四川一省，如果把已经发现的一百多种野生植物利用起来，估计年产六百万担纤维。这个省今年打算用野生纤维加工人造棉十五万担，计划到1960年生产二百五十万担，这个数字相当于1957年全省棉花产量的一点六倍。这说明，利用野生纤维作为代用品，大有可为。
    野生植物油料中已试验成功的有二百二十五种，可作油漆、油墨、肥皂、硬化油、点灯、拭车等用，有的还可以食用。制挥发性油以山苍子为主，苍子油是一种高级香料的原料，每吨价格达二万四千元。过去我国每年都要从国外进口四十吨，自从1955年发现山苍子蒸油成功后，经过两年来的利用，1957年已开始转进口为出口。
    野生淀粉和酿酒代用原料中，产量大、利用率高的有十多种。橡子含有50％以上的淀粉，每百斤可以出六十度的白酒五十斤左右。槐树上的槐豆，过去只作饲料，经试制证明，可以提制治疗高血压的药剂路丁。槐豆还可以用来制酱油、醋、酒、饴糖等，副产品仍可做饲料。
    野生植物中的红根、橡碗、薯莨、檞皮等，都是很好的烤胶原料。红根、橡碗每三吨可提炼烤胶一吨，红根烤胶每吨成本一千多元，橡碗烤胶每吨成本七百多元，这些产品如果利用起来，每年可以为国家节约相当数目的外汇。
    这位负责人说，野生植物不用是草，用起来是宝。怎样才能充分利用？首先要求有关部门特别是商业部门要从思想上解除怕赔钱、怕积压、怕麻烦等顾虑，树立积极发展生产的观点，认识到收集、利用野生植物原料对发展地方工业、支援农业机械化、繁荣山区经济等方面的重大意义，从而主动地勘察资源，帮助农业社制订生产规划，组织群众生产。因为野生植物生长很分散、品种又多、季节性很强，所以在工作中必须紧紧依靠群众，广泛宣传，组织群众性的技术传授，合理地安排劳动力。只有动员广大群众，才能把零星分散的野生植物原料收集起来。因此，野生植物原料的收集不仅是一项经济工作，而且是一项群众工作。同时，也要求工业、科学技术研究等有关部门与商业部门密切协作，多试制，多试用，扩大加工，广泛利用，越多用就越能够促进野生植物的发展和繁殖。
