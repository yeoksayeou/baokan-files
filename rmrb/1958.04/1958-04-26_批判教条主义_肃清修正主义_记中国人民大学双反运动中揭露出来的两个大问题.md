    Criticize Dogmatism and Eradicate Revisionism
    —Recording Two Major Problems Exposed in the Anti-Double Movement at Renmin University of China
    Xu Xiong
    In this anti-double movement, teachers and students of Renmin University of China, through 440,000 big-character posters and tens of thousands of meetings, made a comprehensive and in-depth exposure of the problems existing in teaching and scientific research work, and criticized dogmatism, especially revisionist viewpoints. Although these errors are only "one finger" problem, if we further dissect this "finger", we will find that it is a serious obstacle for all teachers and students of the school to move towards being both red and expert. Now, all teachers and students of the school have deeply realized the seriousness of this problem and are determined to criticize dogmatism, eradicate revisionism, and actively seek ways to reform. "Destroy the old and establish the new"—this is a victory in the struggle between the two roads and two methods in teaching and research work.
      "Lecturing on Practice Theory, Violating Practice Theory;
        Studying Revolutionary History, Separated from Revolutionary History"
    The most prominent manifestation of dogmatism is the separation of theory from practice; only emphasizing "learning theory and improving understanding" while neglecting "linking with practice and transforming thinking." People who hold this attitude believe that: "Theory is the summary of actual struggle, and lecturing on theory itself is linking with practice." They believe that "as long as one studies theory and analyzes data in a realistic manner, one can find conclusions that conform to Marxism-Leninism."
    What is the result of this "linking" "from theoretical articles to theoretical articles"? There is a concept called "production capacity," which perhaps an ordinary worker can explain clearly, but an industrial economics teacher could not explain it clearly even after changing several explanations. Finally, he had to give it such a definition: "Production capacity should be interpreted as the maximum possible annual output of the planned variety of products that can be achieved within a certain period of time, based on the nature of the enterprise's intermittent and non-intermittent production, by fully utilizing the production area, labor force, and all existing equipment in the enterprise's production workshop allocated by the state, adopting advanced working methods, advanced labor organization and production organization, and advanced technical norms for equipment productivity, and taking into account the technical organizational measures of production innovators and the advanced experience of other similar enterprises to ensure the elimination of weak links in production according to the plan." A full 160+ words, and this teacher said that the definition of production capacity has not been fully included.
    There are also such logic teachers who specialize in studying pure logical forms apart from the practical process, emphasizing that the study of formal logic only follows logical rules, regardless of whether the content is right or wrong. For example, one teacher said: "We must admit that the two sentences 'God exists, the Virgin Mary is a virgin' are correct because they conform to logical form. As for whether they are true or false in real life, we can ignore it." The examples that appeared in his lectures in large numbers are this type: "half male and half female," "man bites dog," "he is your father, but not your father," and so on. The students' comments on his lectures are: "The classroom is active during class, but after class, they are at a loss."
    "Shooting without a target" is another manifestation of being divorced from reality. Some teachers are unwilling to understand the students' ideological situation. They have a saying of "division of labor," that is, "Party and Youth League organizations manage ideology, and teachers only manage teaching." They hold the attitude of "teaching books but not teaching people" and are divorced from the students' ideological reality in teaching, losing the combat effectiveness and ideological nature that social sciences should have. A philosophy teacher vigorously preached "communist morality" in class, but did not connect or criticize the bad phenomena such as theft, moral corruption, and serious individualism that were occurring among students. Some teachers vehemently denounced "supra-class objectivism" in class, but were indifferent to the fallacy that "you can't see the truth if you have a position" published by a student who later became a rightist. The graduate students in a class of the Marxism-Leninism Research Class wrote such a couplet to their dogmatic teacher: "Lecturing on Practice Theory, Violating Practice Theory; Studying Revolutionary History, Separated from Revolutionary History." This teacher had been lecturing to this class for a long time, but he did not know a single one of the 96 graduate students in the class.
    The lack of combat effectiveness and ideological nature in teaching is also manifested in the failure to organically combine teaching with forceful criticism of various reactionary theories of Chinese and foreign bourgeoisie. Criminal law, civil law, trial law, etc., are tools of the proletarian dictatorship, and its courses should be full of combat atmosphere, but in the past, the old bourgeois legal views and revisionism were rarely thoroughly criticized in teaching. Each course in each department has its "opposite," but many teachers have not made good use of the theoretical weapons of Marxism to fight.
    The result of being divorced from reality is the phenomenon of "valuing the past over the present" and "valuing foreign over Chinese" in teaching work. Each unit of the basic course of Marxism-Leninism rarely relates to the current situation of class struggle in China. Teachers also rarely used the principles of Marxism-Leninism to elaborate on the characteristics and forms of class struggle in rural and urban areas in our country during the transition period, the regularity of the forms of the basis and the superstructure, and the socialist revolution in politics and ideology. Some people say that the lectures on the history of philosophy are "big head and small tail," only talking about the struggle between the two lines in history, but not talking about the struggle between materialism and idealism in various fields in real life. Chinese philosophy history accounts for a large proportion of pre-Qin philosophy, while Western philosophy history also talks more about ancient Greek and Roman philosophy, and rarely talks about modern and contemporary philosophers.
    When teaching the history of modern Chinese revolution, we should and can easily implement the principle of "valuing the present over the past," but some teachers in the history department still teach "briefly on the present and in detail on the past." For example, the period from the founding of the Party to the Northern Expedition War, a total of eight years, was taught for 63 hours, accounting for 40.3% of the total time, while the socialist revolution period, a total of seven years, was taught for only 12 hours, accounting for only 7.7%.
    There are such teachers who criticize Sismondi's "underconsumption theory" with relish in class. The students hope that he can talk about the fallacies of some bourgeois economists on the so-called capitalist "production balance" and "planned capitalism," as well as whether a crisis is currently occurring in capitalism, and how capitalist production and consumption are specifically reflected, but this teacher did not talk about it. The students sighed and said: "Before and after class are all a mess."
    What is hindering the connection between theory and practice? From the big-character posters posted by teachers and students, there are several reasons: First, there is complacency and conservatism, a lack of sensitivity to new things, and a lack of creative style and spirit of reform. Second, there is a certain degree of metaphysical tendency in the view of theory, valuing books and belittling the Party's policies, instructions, documents, summaries of practical work experience, and reports of Party leaders. Third, simply emphasizing "systematicness" and "standardization" while failing to break the old system and establish a new system according to the actual situation and requirements. Fourth, "theory omnipotence," believing that: "Once theory is mastered and learned, one can naturally understand the laws of social development and learn the position, viewpoint, and method." Fifth, "mysterious thoughts" and "shrinking thoughts," seeing the connection with practice as unpredictable. For example, some people think that scientific research work has a "stage theory," and reading books is the "primary stage"; connecting with thought and connecting with practice is the "advanced stage." These people are afraid that their level is not up to the "advanced stage," so they shrink back in fear. Sixth, the closed-door approach to learning, "not hearing things outside the window, focusing on books," is ignorant of the boiling reality and struggles at home and abroad.
        Surrendering to Capitalist Ideas
            Frequently Sending Overtures to Idealistic Views
    Judging from the materials exposed in this movement, revisionist views in teaching and research work have been on the rise in recent years.
    The more prominent manifestation of revisionism is the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" and the "theory of the outdatedness of class analysis" that once prevailed among some teachers.
    Just when the class struggle in our country was very intense last year, a professor who has been engaged in philosophy work for a long time asserted: "Now the class struggle is about to enter the museum," believing that: "Our country is about to get rid of class society; if Marxism needs to develop, it should not always stay at the stage of class analysis. Because the objective environment has changed, the times are different after all, so the research methods for the history of philosophy should also be changed accordingly."
    Due to the view that "class struggle has basically died out," right-leaning thoughts to varying degrees have once occurred in almost all professional course lectures in the law department; the old bourgeois legal views have also once prevailed among some teachers. The particularly serious problems are: The leading role of the Party in the state and the legal system and the thought of the proletarian dictatorship were not emphasized, or even not mentioned at all, when teaching the socialist legal system course. Many lectures emphasized "preventing mistakes" but not "preventing omissions"; paying attention to preventing "left" but neglecting or even not mentioning preventing right; emphasizing democracy more than dictatorship when talking about the proletarian dictatorship and socialist democracy. Some people also believe that the theory of the proletarian dictatorship is no longer applicable. Some even believe that Stalin's statement on the proletarian dictatorship that "suppressing exploiters" is inaccurate and incomplete and should be changed to "suppressing the resistance of exploiters," meaning that, in general, only mentioning the struggle with exploiters, not suppression.
    Some teachers have doubts and wavering about the fact that law is a tool of class struggle. They believe that our country's law is "the expression of the common will of the four friend classes"; believing that "the bourgeoisie has two sides, two wills, so our law also includes its progressive will, its active side"; believing that people who say that legal rights cannot reflect the will of other classes "confuse the class nature of legal rights with the question of whether legal rights can reflect the will of other classes." This phenomenon of talking about legal provisions while removing class content has also been manifested in the lectures of many teachers.
    Some teachers have also essentially negated the law that "the proletarian regime must thoroughly suppress and eliminate the bourgeoisie." They believe that "suppression is only implemented when the bourgeoisie opposes; and the resistance of the bourgeoisie and rich peasants in our country no longer exists after the basic victory of socialist transformation." When talking about the relationship between the alliance and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in our country, some teachers advocate that "the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie is limited by not breaking the alliance between the two." Regarding the socialist transformation in our country, some people believe that it was "laid the foundation" because a group of "relatively progressive capitalists" emerged in the Three-Anti and Five-Anti movements.
    The "pro-defendant theory" has also appeared in large numbers in some courses in the law department. Among them, there are those who advocate "presumption of innocence," that "one cannot be regarded as a criminal until the court has pronounced a sentence"; some advocate that "the defense counsel in this case cannot be a witness," and "all actions of the defense counsel in the lawsuit must be beneficial to the defendant, and can never reveal the sins hidden by the defendant"; others advocate that "the defendant has the right not to prove his guilt at any time," "the defendant can overturn all or part of the confession when arguing in person," "the defendant's false accusation in court is also the defendant's right to defense," and some even advocate that "there are attempts of counter-revolutionary specific crimes," which means that if counter-revolutionary elements kill cadres but fail to kill them, and set fire to factories but fail to burn them, they are all dealt with as "attempts." In addition, there are various kinds of "pro-defendant theories" in terms of litigation relations, in terms of appeals, and in terms of the force of criminal law. In addition, some people ignore the class content of criminal law and talk about "no punishment without crime," "responsibility for one's own sins," "proportionality of crime and punishment," and "transforming into a new person." The result of such teaching will inevitably promote the right-leaning emotions of some students.
    Revisionist viewpoints in political economics teaching often appear in the guise of opposing dogmatism. Some professors expressed doubts about "whether post-war imperialism is still the five major characteristics," and believed that the principle of "absolute pauperization of the proletariat" was outdated. Some people even declared: "Marx did not talk about the law of absolute pauperization of the proletariat, it was others who falsely conveyed the imperial edict." Some people have also made such modifications to the pauperization theory: "The proletariat is sometimes absolutely pauperized, which is different from the traditional proposition—the continuous or year-by-year pauperization of the working class." Some people also believe that the "total trend of real wages" of the proletariat in capitalist countries "has increased somewhat in terms of quantity," thereby denying Marx's argument that "the total trend of real wages is declining."
    In the past year, this phenomenon of doubting and wavering about the principles of Marxism-Leninism and even attempting to "revise" it has existed to a greater or lesser extent in many departments. In the philosophy department, some people believe that Marxist philosophy "is just a few articles," advising students "not to be superstitious about philosophical theory"; in the law department, some people have wavered about the principle of thoroughly smashing the state apparatus, and more taught and researched the principle of peaceful transition through parliament; in economics, some people believe that "fixed interest is not exploitation," "at most it is exploiting past workers"; in the journalism department, some people believe that: "The regularity of life itself can overcome the contradiction of the backwardness of the writer's world view"; in the history department, some people are keen to study the "multiple forms" of socialist revolution and ignore the path of the October Revolution.
    Following the same path as revisionist views, some people openly praised or "objectively" recommended bourgeois theories in class. For example, an international law teacher introduced to the students, without any criticism, the so-called "seven reasons" for "interference based on rights" by the bourgeois scholar Oppenheim, who made excuses for the intervention of imperialist countries. And said: The imperialist aggression "is a legitimate way to acquire territory." Another international law teacher also promoted the role of the bourgeois parliament in class, and believed that Lenin's statement that the bourgeois parliament is a "talking shop" that deceives the people is outdated. In his lectures, he used 1,500 words to list the definitions of the constitution by bourgeois scholars, and gave these people such wonderful titles: "Sir ××", "American modern thinker ××", one of whom was actually "Luo Longji, a right-wing giant in our country". He then spent more than 200 words to "criticize" the definitions of these 16 people. The result of his "criticism" of Luo Longji's fallacy included our country's constitution as a tool for the government to rule the people. Some philosophy teachers have deep feelings for subjective idealists. They often introduce to students Aristotle, Plato, Hegel, Russell, and others' so-called "spiritual wealth of mankind" and "huge contributions." Some people also believe that idealism is also "a generalization of reality," "which may have correct conclusions." Others believe that "metaphysical materialism is more terrible than idealism." With the spread of these erroneous views by teachers, it is not difficult to understand why some students in the philosophy department who have studied dialectical materialism still doubt the primacy of matter, and some people believe that "there is a spiritual entity in the universe" and "God is in charge of mankind!"
        Reform Teaching Curriculum, Theory Links with Practice
          Eliminate Revisionism, Move towards Being Both Red and Expert
    After exposing and criticizing dogmatism, especially revisionism, Renmin University of China has initially carried out teaching reform work, and a comprehensive teaching and research work overhaul will be carried out after special debates.
    The principles of linking theory with practice and "valuing the present over the past" have now received widespread attention. The "Mao Zedong Comrade Philosophical Works Research Association" has been established and research topics have been drafted. The teaching and research offices of Chinese Revolutionary History, Chinese History, and Trade Economics have begun to determine the task of completing the revision of lectures in advance based on this spirit. The teaching and research offices of criminal law, civil law, and state and legal rights theory in the law department have put forward preliminary reform plans, boldly breaking the original curriculum system, closely combining with Chinese reality, and conducting special lectures. The criminal law course streamlined the original general provisions, changing the 17 chapters into 3 special topics, adding new content such as our country's labor reform policy and the contradictions of crime, and highlighting the central issue of the class nature of criminal law. Now the criminal law teaching and research office has been teaching according to the new system and teaching methods, and has achieved good results. Some teachers who teach civil law, labor law, and legal rights theory have already gone or will go to factories, rural areas, and relevant practical work departments to conduct special research and write lectures according to the new outline.
    In order to teach and link with the students' ideological reality and overcome the phenomenon of "teaching books but not teaching people," most of the teachers in the four political theory teaching and research offices of basic Marxism-Leninism, political economics, philosophy, and Chinese revolutionary history have been assigned to departments and classes to serve as secretaries or branch committee members of the Party and Youth League organizations of the students. Teaching in philosophy and other aspects will also adopt the form of rectification study to implement the principle of ideological transformation.
    There have also been improvements in teaching methods in political economics and other aspects. Su Xing, director of the political economics teaching and research office of the economics department, led students to visit the Tianqiao Commercial Building when teaching the socialist commercial part of political economics, and then asked students to discuss the superiority of socialist commerce, and finally he made a summary. This enabled students to learn theory and solve ideological problems. Li Guangyu, the tutor of the special discussion on Capital, improved the old method of blindly studying the logical structure in the past, and guided the students to criticize Wu Jingchao's "New Theory on China's Population Problem" based on the theory of Capital, and revealed the main revisionist viewpoints on the issue of absolute pauperization. The students warmly welcomed the discussion and criticism.
    Revisionist viewpoints have also begun to be criticized and cleaned up. The teachers involved are determined to further eliminate their revisionist viewpoints in the current self-ideological transformation movement and the ideological debate that is unfolding, and resolutely move towards becoming both red and expert.

    批判教条主义　肃清修正主义
    ——记中国人民大学双反运动中揭露出来的两个大问题
    徐熊
    中国人民大学的教师和学生们在这次双反运动中，通过四十四万张大字报和上万次会议，对教学和科学研究工作中存在的问题作了一次全面而深入的揭发。批判了教条主义特别是修正主义的观点。这些错误虽然只是“一个指头”的问题。可是我们如果进而剖视一下这个“指头”，就会发现它却是全校师生迈向红透专深的一个严重的障碍物。现在，全校师生都深刻地认识到这个问题的严重性，决心批判教条主义，肃清修正主义，并且积极寻求改革的办法。“破而后立”，这就是这场在教学和研究工作上两条道路和两种方法斗争的一个胜利。
      “讲授实践论，违背实践论；
        研究革命史，脱离革命史”
    教条主义最突出的表现，就是理论脱离实际；只强调了“学习理论、提高认识”，而忽视了“联系实际、改造思想”。抱这样态度的人认为：“理论是实际斗争的总结，讲理论本身就联系了实际”。认为
  “只要实事求是地研究理论分析资料，就可以找到同马列主义相符合的结论”。
    这种“从理论条文到理论条文”的“联系”的结果到底怎样呢？有一个叫“生产能力”的概念，也许一个普通工人就可以把它解释清楚，可是一个工业经济教师却一连换了几种说法都未能说清楚。最后，他只好替它下了这样一个定义：“生产能力应解释为在一定时期内，根据企业间断生产和非间断生产的性质，去充分利用生产面积劳动力和国家拨给企业生产车间的全部现有设备条件下，采用先进的工作方法，先进劳动组织和生产组织以及设备生产率的先进技术定额，并考虑到生产革新者和其它同类企业的先进经验的技术组织措施，来保证消除生产上薄弱环节按计划所规定产品品种所能发挥的最大可能年产量”。足足一百六十多字，而这位教师却说生产能力的定义还没有全部包括进去。
    也有这样的逻辑教师，他们离开实践过程去专门研究纯粹的逻辑形式，强调研究形式逻辑只遵守逻辑规律，不管内容对错。如一个教师这样说：“我们必须承认‘上帝是存在，圣母是处女’二句是对的，因为它符合逻辑形式，至于现实生活中究属真或假我们可不计较。”在他讲授中大量出现的例句是这一类：“半男半女”，“人咬狗”，“他是你爸爸，又不是你爸爸”，等等。学生们对他的讲课的评论是：“听课时课堂活跃，下课时茫然若有所失。”
    “无的放矢”，是脱离实际的另一种表现。有一部分教师不愿了解学生的思想情况。他们有一种“分工论”的说法，即所谓：“党团组织管思想，教师只管教学。”他们便抱着“教书不教人”的态度，在教学中脱离了学生思想实际，失去了社会科学应该具有的战斗性和思想性。一位哲学教师，他一面在课堂上大讲“共产主义道德”，一面对学生中正发生的偷盗事故、道德败坏和严重个人主义等恶劣现象丝毫不加联系和批判。也有的教师在课堂上声嘶力竭地痛斥“超阶级的客观主义”，而面对一个后来成为右派分子的学生所发表的“有立场就看不见真理”的谬论，竟若无其事。马列主义研究班有一个分班的研究生们就给他们一位教条主义的老师写了这样一副对联：“讲授实践论，违背实践论；研究革命史，脱离革命史。”这位教师长期替这个班讲课，但是全班九十六个研究生他一个也不认识。
    教学中缺乏战斗性和思想性还表现在：没有有机地结合教学，有力地批判中外资产阶级各种反动理论。刑法、民法、审判法等本是无产阶级专政的工具，它的课程应该是充满了战斗气息的，可是从前在教学中也很少对资产阶级旧法观点和修正主义进行彻底的批判。各系的每门课都有它的“对立面”，可是不少教师却没有很好地运用起马克思主义的理论武器进行战斗。
    脱离实际的结果，在教学工作中，造成了“厚古薄今”、“重外轻中”的现象。马列主义基础课的每个单元都很少联系到中国当前阶级斗争情况。教师们在讲课时也很少运用马克思列宁主义原理阐述我国过渡时期农村和城市阶级斗争的特点和形式，基础和上层建筑形式的规律性，以及政治上和思想上的社会主义革命等问题。有人说哲学史的讲稿是“大头小尾”，光讲历史上的两条路线的斗争，而不讲现实生活中唯物主义和唯心主义在各个领域的斗争。中国哲学史占很大比重的是先秦哲学，而西洋哲学史也是古希腊和罗马哲学讲的多，近代和现代的哲学家很少讲到。
    讲中国现代革命史，本来应该而且也容易贯彻“厚今薄古”的原则，可是历史系有的教师讲的仍然是“略今详古”。如党的成立和北伐战争时期共八年，讲授时数为六十三小时，占总时数40.3％，社会主义革命时期共七年，讲授时数仅十二小时，只占总时数7.7％。
    有这样的教师，在课堂上对西斯蒙蒂的“消费不足论”批判得津津有味。学生们希望他能谈谈当前一些资产阶级经济学者的所谓资本主义“生产的平衡”和“计划资本主义”等谬论，以及目前资本主义是否发生危机，资本主义生产和消费如何具体体现等，但是这位教师却没有谈。学生们感叹地说：“课前课后都是一笔糊涂账。”
    是什么东西妨碍了理论联系实际呢？从师生们贴的大字报来分析，有几个原因：第一、存在着骄傲自满和保守思想，缺乏对于新鲜事物的敏感，缺乏创造性的作风和改革的精神。第二、对理论的看法上存在一定程度的形而上学倾向，重视书本，轻视党的政策、指示、文件、实际工作经验总结和党的领导人的报告等。第三、单纯强调“系统性”、“正规化”，而又不能根据现实情况和要求，打破旧体系，建立新体系。第四、“理论万能论”，认为：“理论掌握了，学完了，自然而然就能认识社会发展规律，学会立场、观点、方法。”第五、“神秘思想”和“缩头思想”，把联系实际看得高深莫测。如有些人认为科学研究工作有“阶段论”，就书读书是“初级阶段”；联系思想、联系实际是“高级阶段”。这些人怕自己水平够不上“高级阶段”，惧而缩头。第六、学习方法上的闭门造车，“两耳不闻窗外事，一心埋头书本中”，对国内外沸腾着的现实生活和斗争状况孤陋寡闻。
        向资本主义思想屈膝投降
            对唯心主义观点频送秋波
    从这次运动中揭发的材料来看，教学和研究工作中的修正主义观点在近年来是有所抬头的。
    修正主义比较突出的表现，就是一度在一部分教师中流行的“阶级斗争熄灭论”和“阶级分析过时论”。
    正当去年我国阶级斗争非常激烈的时候，一位长期从事哲学工作的教授却断言：“现在阶级斗争将要进入博物馆”，认为：“我国即将脱离阶级社会了；马克思主义如需要发展，便不应老是停留在阶级分析的阶段上。因为客观环境起了变化，时代毕竟是不同了，因此对哲学史的研究方法也应相应改变。”
    由于抱有“阶级斗争基本熄灭”的看法，在法律系几乎所有专业课讲义中都曾一度产生了一些程度不同的右倾思想；资产阶级的旧法观点也在一些教师中一度盛行。其中特别严重的问题是：关于党在国家和法制中的领导作用和无产阶级专政思想，在讲社会主义法制课时竟没有被强调，甚至根本未谈。许多讲义强调“防错”，不强调“防漏”；注意防“左”，忽视甚至不谈防右；讲无产阶级专政和社会主义民主问题时也都是强调民主多于专政。有些人还认为无产阶级专政的理论已不适用。甚至有人认为斯大林论述无产阶级专政时说的“镇压剥削者”不确切、不完备，应改为“镇压剥削者的反抗”，意思就是说，在一般情况下，只提同剥削者进行斗争，不提镇压。
    有些教师对法律是阶级斗争的工具，发生怀疑和动摇。他们认为，我国法律是“四个朋友阶级共同意志的表现”；认为“资产阶级有两面性，有两个意志，所以我们的法律也是包括它的进步意志，它的积极性一面”；认为说法权不能反映其它阶级的意志的人，“是把法权的阶级性质问题和法权是可能反映其它的阶级意志的问题混为一谈。”这种抽去阶级内容而谈法律条文的现象在不少教师的讲课中也表现了出来。
    “无产阶级政权必须彻底镇压和消灭资产阶级论”这一规律，也有些教师在实质上否定了它。他们认为“只有当资产阶级反对时，才实行镇压；而我国资产阶级和富农的反抗，在社会主义改造基本胜利后已不存在”。在讲到我国无产阶级和资产阶级的联盟和斗争关系问题时，有的教师主张“工人阶级对资产阶级的斗争，是以不破裂两者联盟为界限”。对我国的社会主义改造，有人认为，是由于在三反、五反斗争中产生了一批“比较进步的资本家”而“打下了基础”。
    “有利被告论”在法律系的一些课程中也曾一度大量出现。其中有主张“法院未宣判就不能当作犯罪人”的“无罪推定”；有人主张“本案辩护人不能作证人”，“辩护人在诉讼中一切行为都要有利于被告，永远不能揭发被告所隐瞒的罪恶”；还有人主张“被告在任何时候都有权力不证明自己的罪行”、“被告人个人辩论时，可以推翻全部或部分的承认”、
  “被告在法庭上的诬告也是被告的辩护权”甚至有人还主张“反革命具体罪有未遂”，就是说如果反革命分子杀害干部未杀死，放火烧工厂未烧着，也都按“未遂”处理。其他在诉讼关系方面，在上诉方面，在刑事法律的濒及力方面等，都有各式各样的“有利被告论”。此外，还有人忽略了刑法的阶级内容而谈“无罪不罚”、“罪责自负”、“罪刑相称”和“改造成新人”等主张。这样教学的结果，必然助长了某些学生的右倾情绪。
    修正主义观点在政治经济学的教学中是常常以反对教条主义面目出现的，有些教授对“战后帝国主义是否仍然是五大特征”表示怀疑，对“无产阶级绝对贫困化”原理认为过时了。有人还宣称：“马克思并没有讲过无产阶级绝对贫困化规律，是别人假传圣旨。”还有人对贫困化理论作了这样的修改：“无产阶级有时候绝对贫困化，这同传统提法——工人阶级不断的或逐年的贫困化有别。”也有人认为资本主义国家无产阶级“实际工资的总趋势从量的方面看是有所提高的”，从而否认了马克思关于“实际工资的总趋势是下降”的论点。
    在过去这一年中，这种对马克思列宁主义的原理发生怀疑和动摇甚至企图“修正”它的现象，在不少系几乎都或多或少地存在着。在哲学系有人认为马克思主义哲学“就那么几条条”，劝学生“不要迷信哲学理论”；在法律系有人对彻底打碎国家机器这一原理发生动摇，而更多地去讲授和研究议会和平过渡的原则；在经济学方面有人认为“定息不是剥削”，“顶多也是剥削过去工人的”；在新闻系有人认为：“人生本身的规律性，可以克服作家世界观的落后的矛盾”；在历史系也有人热中于研究社会主义革命的“多种形式”而忽视了十月革命的道路。
    同修正主义观点殊途同归的，还有人在课堂上公开颂扬或者“客观主义”地推荐资产阶级学说。如有一个国际公法教师，竟一点未加批判地向学生们介绍了为帝国主义国家进行干涉而制造借口的资产阶级学者奥本海的所谓“根据权利干涉”的“七大理由”。并说：帝国主义的侵略行为“是取得领土的合法方法”。另一个国际法教师也在课堂上鼓吹资产阶级国会的作用，而认为列宁的关于资产阶级国会是欺骗人民的
  “清谈馆”的说法过时了。在他的讲义里他曾用一千五百字罗列了资产阶级学者关于宪法的定义，并给这些人这样美妙的头衔；“××爵士”、“美国现代思想家××”，其中有一个竟是“我国右派巨头罗隆基”。他又花二百多个字“批判”这十六个人的定义。他“批判”罗隆基谬论的结果，把我国的宪法也包括进政府统治人民的工具了。一部分哲学教师对主观唯心主义者有着浓厚感情。他们常向学生介绍亚里士多德、柏拉图、黑格尔和罗素等人的所谓“人类的精神财富”和“巨大的贡献”。有人还认为唯心主义也是“对现实的概括”，“其中可能有正确的结论”。还有人认为“形而上学唯物主义比唯心主义更可怕”。有了教师们这些错误观点的传播，人们就不难理解，为什么在学习了辩证唯物主义的哲学系学生中，还有人怀疑物质第一性，还有人认为“宇宙有精神实体存在”而“上帝在主宰人类！”
        改革教学课程，理论联系实际
          肃清修正主义，迈向红透专深
    经过对教条主义特别是修正主义的揭露和批判，中国人民大学已初步进行了教学改革工作，而全面的教学和研究工作的大整大改也即将在专题大争大辩后进行。
    理论联系实际，“厚今薄古”等原则现已受到了普遍重视。“毛泽东同志哲学著作研究会”已经成立，并已拟定研究题目。中国革命史、中国历史、贸易经济等教研室已开始根据这一精神，决定提前完成修改讲义的任务。法律系刑法、民法和国家与法权理论等教研室已提出了初步改革方案，大胆地打破了原来课程体系，紧密结合中国实际，专题进行讲授。刑法课把原来总则部分加以精简，由十七章改为三个专题，比原来增加了我国的劳动改造政策，以及犯罪的矛盾等新内容，并且突出了刑法阶级性这一中心问题。现在刑法教研室已经按新的体系和教学方法教课，收到了较好的效果。讲授民法、劳动法、法权理论等课的一些教师已经或将要下厂、下乡和有关的实际工作部门，进行专题研究，按新的提纲编写讲义。
    为了教学联系学生思想实际，克服“教书不教人”的现象，马克思列宁主义基础、政治经济学、哲学和中国革命史等四个政治理论教研室的大部分教师已下放到系、班，担任学生的党、团组织书记或支委。哲学等方面教学也将采取整风学习的方式，以贯彻思想改造原则。
    在政治经济学等方面的教学方法上也有了改进。经济系政治经济教研室主任苏星，在讲授政治经济学社会主义商业部分时，带领学生去天桥商场参观，回来后让学生讨论社会主义商业的优越性，最后他再作一总结。这样使学生既学到了理论，又解决了思想问题。资本论专题讨论指导教师李光宇改进了过去死啃逻辑结构法老一套的方法，引导学生根据资本论理论等批判右派分子吴景超的“中国人口问题新论”，并揭示了关于绝对贫困化问题的主要修正主义论点。让大家讨论批判，受到学生的热烈欢迎。
    修正主义观点也已经开始受到批判和清洗。有关教师都决心在当前自我思想改造运动中和正在展开的思想大辩论中，进一步肃清他们的修正主义观点，坚决向红透专深迈进。
