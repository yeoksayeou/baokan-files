    Supporting Local Industry is Our Bounden Duty
    Huainan Coal Mine Actively Helps Localities to Exploit Small Coal Pits
    (Our newspaper's Hefei dispatch on April 28th) Huainan Coal Mine plans to adopt three measures to vigorously support the exploitation of small coal pits in various parts of Anhui.
    (1) According to local needs, it is prepared to transfer two to three hundred senior technical workers to serve as technical guidance for the exploitation of small coal pits in various places. These veteran technicians all have more than ten years of seniority, many of whom have exploited small coal pits in the past. Recently, an old technician sent to Zhide County helped the county's small coal pits solve two or thirty problems such as support, ventilation, and underground drainage in more than twenty days, and was very popular with local officials and new workers.
    (2) According to the geological conditions of coal throughout the province, design a set of design and construction drawings for the exploitation of small coal pits, including those with an annual output of 10,000 tons, 30,000 tons, 50,000 tons, and 100,000 tons for various places to construct according to the drawings.
    (3) Adopt the method of producing, explaining, and learning at the same time to help train a group of workers sent by various localities to study.
    In order to better help various localities exploit small coal pits, the Huainan Mining Bureau has also established a work group to support local coal mines, which is personally led by a deputy director to specifically liaise with various localities. (Yu Feng)

    支援地方工业义不容辞
    淮南煤矿积极帮助各地开采小窑煤
    本报合肥28日电　淮南煤矿拟采取三项措施大力支援安徽各地开采小窑煤。
    （一）根据地方需要准备抽调二、三百名老年技术工人去各地担任开采小窑煤的技术指导工作。这些老技工都有十年以上的工龄，其中很多过去都开采过小窑煤。最近派到至德县去的一位老技工，二十多天里就帮助该县小窑煤解决了支架、通风、井下排水等二、三十个问题，很受地方和新工人的欢迎。
    （二）根据全省煤的地质情况，设计一套开采小窑煤的设计施工图纸，其中有年产一万吨、三万吨、五万吨和十万吨的以便各地按图施工。
    （三）采用边生产、边讲解、边学习的办法，帮助培训一批各地送来学习的工人。
    为了更好地帮助各地开采小窑煤，淮南矿务局还成立了支援地方煤矿工作小组，由一副局长亲自领导，专门和各地联系。　（于风）
