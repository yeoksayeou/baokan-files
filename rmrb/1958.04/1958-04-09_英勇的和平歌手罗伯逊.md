    The heroic singer for peace, Paul Robeson
    April 9th of this year marks the sixtieth birthday of Paul Robeson. This well-known African-American singer and passionate fighter for peace, democracy, and the freedom of people of color was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1898. His father had once been a slave. Young Robeson worked his way through college, working as a farmhand, coffee shop waiter, and dockworker.

    In 1924, Robeson first stepped onto the stage in a small theater in Harlem, New York. His extraordinary musical talent quickly became apparent. Soon, he became a singer beloved by the masses. He performed in famous music halls in the United States, Britain, France, Poland, Austria, and Romania, earning great acclaim.

    At the height of his fame, Robeson returned to the United States. The economic crisis was shaking the country at that time. He saw more clearly the disasters that the decaying capitalist system brought to the people.

    In 1934, Robeson visited the Soviet Union for the first time. The great Soviet Union left an indelible impression on Robeson, who marveled at "this excellent world, like another planet." "And how should I make life in our country bright and happy as well?" Robeson saw the true hope of mankind in the Soviet Union.

    From then on, Robeson's singing became even more vigorous. His songs pierced through the black fog of fascism, encouraging the people to fight. When the German and Italian fascist bandits attacked the Spanish people, Robeson called out: Artists should not hide from the Nazi plague in "ivory towers". During World War II, he actively encouraged the people of all countries fighting against fascism and for their own freedom and independence with his powerful singing.

    In the post-war years, Robeson enthusiastically participated in the American people's struggle to defend peace. He declared more than once: "I stand on the side of the people, and I will always serve the people as an artist with political beliefs." In August 1949, American fascists openly and massively attacked Robeson's concert in Peekskill, attempting to persecute him with violence, but Robeson never stopped fighting for peace. He denounced the American aggression against Korea, criticized the British war of aggression against Malaya, and enthusiastically participated in domestic and international peace conferences and mass rallies. He traveled around the American continent, using his singing to encourage the cause of fighting for peace. In December 1956, during the difficult days when he was persecuted by the American government, he even sang a Russian song on the phone to the Soviet land reclamation youth thousands of kilometers away. Due to his outstanding contribution to the world people's struggle for peace, he was elected as a member of the World Peace Council and honorably won the Stalin International Peace Prize for Strengthening International Peace in 1952.

    Robeson has consistently worked to fight for the liberation of black people. He served as the chairman of the African Affairs Council, a progressive organization of black people in the United States. He personally participated in actual struggles, and he once resolutely participated in street demonstrations, regardless of the threats from the American Ku Klux Klan. In 1948, he participated in a demonstration surrounding the White House, protesting the Truman administration's policy of discrimination against black people. He solemnly declared: "As long as I am in Washington, I will participate in demonstrations every day."

    Robeson widely participated in the American progressive struggle to defend democracy and freedom. In September 1949, when the American government persecuted the leaders of the American Communist Party, he voluntarily appeared in court to testify in defense of the leaders of the American Communist Party. He sternly pointed out: "This trial is part of the hysteria."

    In recent years, the American government has severely persecuted Robeson. For several years, Robeson has been unreasonably detained in the United States, forbidden to perform abroad, and prevented from singing at public gatherings. Secret agents follow him, and the bourgeois newspapers slander him. His income has been forced to decrease from 1950 to two thousand dollars, less than one-fiftieth of what it was before. But these persecutions have made Robeson even stronger. On February 8th of this year, he proudly announced again: "My political views are still the same as in the past" "I firmly believe that socialism is the way to get rid of poverty." He returned to the ranks of the people, going to factories, mines, schools, using parks, auditoriums, streets, and even cars, and began to sing even louder.

    Robeson harbors genuine affection for the Chinese people. He hailed the founding of New China, and he has repeatedly sung passionately for the achievements of the Chinese people. The Chinese "March of the Volunteers" has become one of his favorite songs. The Chinese people have invited Robeson to visit China several times. This invitation has not been realized so far due to the obstruction of the American government. But people believe that the power of peace will eventually overcome all artificial barriers, and Robeson's wonderful singing will one day resound on the land of New China.

    英勇的和平歌手罗伯逊
    今年4月9日是保罗·罗伯逊的六十岁寿辰。这位知名的美国黑人歌唱家，争取和平、民主与有色人种自由的热情战士，于1898年诞生在美国新泽西州的普林斯顿城。父亲曾经作过奴隶。青年的罗伯逊是以工读读完大学的。他作过农场工人、咖啡店侍役和码头装卸工人。
    1924年，罗伯逊在纽约哈伦黑人区的小戏院，初次登上舞台。他的非凡的音乐天才很快地显露出来。不久他成了为广大人民所喜爱的歌手。他先后在美国、英国、法国、波兰、奥地利和罗马尼亚的著名音乐堂演出，获得巨大的声誉。
    罗伯逊在他声誉最隆的时候重返美国。那时经济危机正震撼着这个国家。他更看清楚了腐朽的资本主义制度给人民带来的祸害。
    1934年，罗伯逊第一次访问苏联。伟大的苏联给罗伯逊留下不可磨灭的印象，他惊叹“这个如同另一个星球般的优秀世界”。“而我又应当怎样使我们在我们祖国的生活也能变得明朗与快乐”。罗伯逊在苏联看到了人类的真正希望。
    从此以后，罗伯逊的歌声更加昂扬起来。他的歌声穿过法西斯的黑色浊雾，鼓励人民进行战斗。在德意法西斯匪徒进攻西班牙人民的时候，罗伯逊号召说：艺术家不应该在“象牙之塔”里隐藏纳粹的瘟疫。在第二次世界大战中，他用雄壮的歌声，积极鼓舞了反对法西斯、争取自己的自由和独立的各国人民进行斗争。
    在战后的年代里，罗伯逊热情参加了美国人民保卫和平的斗争。他不止一次的宣布：“我是站在人民一边的，我永远以有政治信仰的艺术家的身份为人民服务。”美国的法西斯分子在1949年8月在皮克斯基尔镇，公然大举袭击罗伯逊的音乐会，想用暴力来迫害他，但是罗伯逊一刻也没有停止过为和平而斗争。他斥责美国侵略朝鲜的罪行，抨击英国对马来亚的侵略战争，他热情参加国内外的和平会议与群众集会。他周游美国大陆，用歌声鼓舞为和平而斗争的事业。在1956年12月，在他被美国政府迫害的艰难日子里，他还在电话里，给几千公里外的苏联垦荒青年，唱一支俄文歌曲。由于他对世界人民和平斗争的杰出贡献，他被选为世界和平理事会的理事。并在1952年光荣获得“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金。
    罗伯逊一贯为争取黑人解放而努力。他担任过美国黑人的进步组织“非洲事务会议”的主席，他亲身参加实际的斗争，他曾经不顾美国“三K党”徒的威胁，毅然参加街头游行示威。1948年他参加包围白宫的示威，抗议杜鲁门政府歧视黑人的政策，他庄严地声明：“只要我在华盛顿一天，我将每天参加示威”。
    罗伯逊广泛参加了维护民主与自由的美国进步斗争。在1949年9月当美国政府迫害美国共产党领导人时，他自动出席法庭作证为美国共产党领导人辩护。他严正指出：“这个审判是歇斯底里的一部分”。
    美国政府近年来对罗伯逊进行了严重的迫害。几年来，罗伯逊被无理扣留在美国，不许他出国演唱，不让他在公共集会上唱歌。特务尾随在他的身后，资产阶级报纸对他大肆诬蔑。他的收入从1950年起被迫减少到两千美元，不到以前的五十分之一。但是这些迫害反而使罗伯逊更加坚强起来。在今年2月8日，他再度自豪地宣布：“我的政治见解仍和过去一样”“我深信，社会主义是摆脱贫困的方法”。他回到人民的队伍中间，到工厂，矿山、学校、利用公园、礼堂、大街甚至是汽车，开始了更响亮的歌唱。
    罗伯逊对于中国人民抱着真切的感情，他欢呼新中国的成立，他多次为中国人民的成就而纵情歌唱。中文的“义勇军进行曲”成为他最喜爱的歌曲之一。中国人民曾经几次邀请罗伯逊来中国参观访问。这个邀请在美国政府的阻挠下，迄今不能实现。但是人们相信，和平的力量终将推倒一切人为的壁障，罗伯逊的绝妙歌声一定会有一天飘荡在新中国的土地上。
