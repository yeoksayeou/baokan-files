    "Leap Forward Brand" Gas Engine
    A small and flexible five-horsepower "Leap Forward Brand" gas engine has recently been successfully trial-produced by the Zhalantun Farm Tool Factory and has begun mass production.

    Each of these gas engines costs only a little over 700 yuan. It can drive pumps, waterwheels, water pumps, chaff cutters, threshing machines, and small generators; it can also be used to drive old-fashioned stone rollers and stone mills. Coal, charcoal, wood shavings, and corn stalks are all good fuels for it. When burning coal, only a little over 120 jin is enough for eight hours. The operation and maintenance of this machine are very simple, and it is suitable for rural and pastoral areas.
