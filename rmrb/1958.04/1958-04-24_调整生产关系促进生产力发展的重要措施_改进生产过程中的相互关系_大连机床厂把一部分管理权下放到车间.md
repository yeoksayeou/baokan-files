(Our newspaper’s correspondent in Lushun-Dalian, Gu Tiefeng, reports) Dalian Machine Tool Plant has decentralized some management authority from the departments to the workshops, enabling management work to closely integrate with the actual production, and fully leverage the enthusiasm of workshop cadres and workers. In the first quarter of this year, the plant exceeded its total output value plan by 9.7%, with the average daily output for the quarter reaching a record high.

Dalian Machine Tool Plant is an enterprise specializing in the production of precision machine tools, with more than 1,800 people and six or seven workshops. However, the management structure was very large, with the 24 departments under the leadership of the plant director grasping all the work, large and small. The workshops could only carry out production according to the original plan and had no right to interfere in management issues. Moreover, the numerous rules and regulations formulated by many departments often deviated from the actual production in the workshops. For example, in the past, a workshop had to obtain approval from the materials department to use a small piece of material, and approval from the finance department to use one yuan; sometimes a simple matter had to go through a joint “signature and seal” process by several departments, so that easy-to-do things had to be abandoned. As a result, contradictions arose constantly between the departments and the workshops. Management personnel and production personnel often argued, shirked responsibility, and blamed each other.

After the enterprise began the rectification campaign in the second half of last year, the workers posted tens of thousands of big-character posters, concentrating on exposing this contradiction between the enterprise's management departments and the production workshops. Based on the opinions of the masses, the leadership drastically streamlined the management structure, merging the 24 departments into 13, reducing management personnel by 54%, and transferring some management cadres to the workshops to strengthen the workshop leadership. At the same time, it also gradually decentralized some management authority to the directly producing workshops.

The Dalian Machine Tool Plant calls the scope of the division of power between the plant level and the workshop as "two, four, six." The "two" means that the plant level must grasp the two major management powers of production scheduling and plan balancing; the "four" means that the plant level controls the four major economic indicators of output variety, output value, quality, and cost on a quarterly basis; the "six" means that six management powers are decentralized to the workshops: the planning department decentralizes four powers to the workshops – output variety, output value, cost, and quality indicators. In the past, these indicators were issued once a month, but now they are issued once a quarter. Within a quarter, the workshops have the right to flexibly schedule according to the priority, importance, etc. The inspection department decentralizes the right to inspect product quality to the workshops, and the original inspectors are led by the workshop director instead of the department, which increases the workshop's responsibility for product quality and can change the past phenomenon of antagonism and wrangling between inspectors and workshops. After the technology department decentralizes the right to formulate technology, the workshops have the right to formulate and modify the technology, making the product technology more in line with actual production. The economic rights (workshop expense expenditures, bonus distribution, etc.), medium and minor repair of machine equipment, and the right to determine working hour quotas, which were originally managed by the plant level, are also gradually decentralized to the workshops by the departments, so that workshop cadres and workers are more concerned about reducing product costs, actively and flexibly repairing machine equipment, and rationally formulating working hour quotas.

The innovative measures of this plant in decentralizing part of the management authority to the workshops have achieved good results after three months of practice. The management work of the enterprise is more closely integrated with the actual production, and the workshops' responsibilities have increased. The workshop cadres also have a clear understanding of various tasks, which facilitates the scheduling of various positive factors and allows everyone to work together to improve production. Qu Mianrong, the director of the casting workshop, said that in the past, workshop management cadres were like cooks who didn't know the price of firewood and rice. They were busy with production all day long, doing whatever they were assigned, but they didn't know the product cost, let alone caring about how to reduce costs. After the cost personnel were decentralized, the cook knew the price of firewood and rice, had a clear understanding in his mind, and tried to reduce costs everywhere. Once, he found that the raw material supply plan stipulated the use of some scrap steel shavings, but the relevant departments delivered scrap steel that was more than twice as expensive per ton as scrap steel shavings. Therefore, he took the initiative to discuss with the supply department and exchanged it for scrap steel shavings. Many workshop directors are also more concerned about product quality than in the past. When a weak link in quality occurs in the workshop, the workshop director always takes the initiative to transfer strong inspectors to check and mobilize workers to find ways to improve the quality of products.

After the decentralization of some management authority at the plant level, the inspectors, cost personnel, technology personnel, etc., who originally belonged to the departments, moved from the departments to the workshops to work. Therefore, some complicated and inapplicable rules and regulations were naturally abolished, and things were done quickly and in a timely manner, making everyone happy. For example, Cong Qizi, the deputy director of the casting workshop, recently discovered that a machine tool part was too large and wasted molten iron. He pulled the technology personnel to the site to study with the workers, modified the technology on the spot, and produced according to the newly successfully tested method, saving 1.3 kg of molten iron for each new part. In the past, similar modifications to the technology had to be approved by the technology department according to the system. Some technical innovation proposals were often backlogged or buried and became "difficult births" because they had to be approved by the departments at various levels. Now that the unreasonable rules and regulations have been abolished, a mass technical innovation upsurge has gradually formed, and workers' tool improvements, inventions, and technical innovation activities have emerged in large numbers.

After the decentralization of some management authority at the plant level, the relationship between management personnel and production personnel has been closely linked, and a new atmosphere of political unity and work collaboration has emerged in the enterprise. Su Junyan, the director of the plant, said: The plant director, management personnel, and production personnel were "three dissatisfied" in the past, but now they have become "three satisfied." The plant director can get rid of some administrative work and use his main energy to consider major issues of the entire plant; the management personnel combine with the directly producing workers and are no longer troubled by being divorced from the actual production; and the directly producing personnel are freed from the constraints of some unreasonable rules and regulations, and their production enthusiasm can be fully utilized.

    调整生产关系促进生产力发展的重要措施
    改进生产过程中的相互关系
    大连机床厂把一部分管理权下放到车间
    本报旅大23日电　记者顾铁风报道：大连机床厂把一些科室的管理权下放到车间，使管理工作密切结合生产实际，充分发挥车间干部和职工的积极性。今年第一季度，全厂超额9.7％完成总产值计划，季度平均日产量创历史最高纪录。
    大连机床厂是专门生产精密机床的企业，有一千八百多人，六、七个车间。但管理机构非常庞大，厂长领导下的二十四个科室，把大小工作都抓在手里，车间只能够按照原订计划进行生产，无权过问管理工作上的问题。而许多科室制定的名目繁多的规章制度，又常常脱离车间的生产实际。例如，过去车间要动用一块小材料，必须经过材料科批准，要动用一元钱，也要财务科批准；有时一件简单的事情，也要经过几个科室联合“签字盖章”，以致使容易办到的事情也只得作罢。结果，科室与车间之间不断发生矛盾。管理人员同生产人员常常扯皮、推诿、互相埋怨。
    去年下半年企业开始整风以后，职工们贴出数以万计的大字报，集中地揭发了企业管理科室同生产车间之间的这种矛盾，领导上根据群众的意见，大刀阔斧精简管理机构，把二十四个科室并为十三个，精简管理人员54％，并且抽调一部分管理干部下放车间，充实车间领导力量。同时，还把一些管理权逐步下放到直接生产的车间。
    大连机床厂把厂级同车间的分权的范围，叫作为“二、四、六”。所谓“二”，就是厂一级必须掌握住生产调度和计划平衡两大管理权；所谓“四”，就是厂一级按季度掌握产量品种、产值、质量、成本四大经济指标；所谓“六”，就是有六项管理权下放到车间：计划科下放到车间的有四项权——产量品种、产值、成本、质量指标。过去，这些指标是每月下达一次，现在改为每季下达一次，在一个季度内，车间有权按照主次、轻重等情况灵活调度。检查科把产品质量的检查权下放到车间，原来的检查员由科室领导改由车间主任统一领导，这样就加重了车间关心产品质量的责任，可以改变过去检查员同车间对立、扯皮的现象。工艺科把制定工艺权下放后，车间有权制定和修改工艺，使产品工艺更切合生产实际。原来由厂级管理的经济权（车间经费开支、分发奖金等）、中修、小修机器设备权和决定工时定额权，也都分别由科室逐步下放到车间，使车间干部和职工更关心降低产品成本，主动灵活地修理机器设备，合理地制定工时定额。
    这个厂把部分管理权下放到车间的革新措施，经过三个月实践，已经收到了良好的效果。企业的管理工作与生产实际更能密切结合了，车间的责任加重了。车间干部对各项工作也心中有数了，这就便于调度各方面的积极因素，上下一齐把生产搞好。铸造车间主任曲绵潼说，过去车间管理干部像个不知柴米价的厨司，整天忙着生产，上边给什么活干什么活，却不知产品成本，更不去关心怎样去降低成本。这次成本员下放后，这位厨司知道了柴米价，心中有了数，到处设法降低成本。一次，他发现原料供应计划中规定要使用一部分废钢屑，但有关部门却给运来每吨比废钢屑贵两倍多的废钢。于是，他主动同供应科商量，调换废钢屑使用。许多车间主任也比过去更加关心产品质量了。车间中发生了质量薄弱的环节，车间主任总是主动抽调强有力的检查员去检查，并且发动工人设法改进产品的质量。
    厂一级部分管理权下放后，原来属于科室的检查员、成本员、工艺员等，都由科室搬到车间办公。因此，一些繁杂的不适用的规章制度自然废除了，办事迅速及时，人人痛快。例如铸造车间副主任丛杞滋，最近发现有一个机床部件过大，浪费铁水。他就拉着工艺员到现场和工人一起研究，就地修改工艺，并按照试验成功的新方法进行生产，使每个新部件节约铁水一点三公斤。而在以前，类似这样修改工艺，得按制度经工艺科批准。有些技术革新建议，往往由于必须经过科室层层批准，常常被积压或被埋没而成为“难产”。现在，不合理的规章制度取消了，群众性的技术革新热潮已经逐渐形成，工人的工具改进、发明创造和技术革新活动，已经大量涌现。
    厂一级部分管理权下放后，随之密切了管理人员与生产人员的关系，企业中出现了政治上团结、工作上协作的新风气。这个厂的厂长苏君彦说：厂长、管理人员、生产人员，过去“三不满意”，现在变为“三满意”了。厂长可以摆脱部分事务工作，用主要精力考虑全厂重大问题；管理人员同直接生产的工人相结合，不再为脱离生产实际而苦恼；而直接生产的人员，解除一些不合理规章制度的束缚，生产积极性可以充分发挥。
