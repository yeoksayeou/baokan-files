    The first round of the 1958 National Volleyball League A has concluded after one hundred and forty-eight matches in Tianjin, Wuhan, and Shanghai. This round of matches has left a striking impression: the men's and women's teams participating in the competition have made rapid progress in tactics and techniques, and the notion that any team maintained an "absolute advantage" in technique has been shattered.

    Guangzhou, the third-place men's team last year, defeated last year's champion "August 1st" team and runner-up Beijing team in the league. The "August 1st" team had never lost in a domestic league since its establishment. The Beijing men's team, with four master athletes, not only lost to the Guangzhou team but also to the Chengdu team, which ranked sixth in last year's league. The Jiangxi team, newly promoted from last year's League B, was able to win a set in each match against Beijing and "August 1st," and also defeated the Chengdu team, which ranked sixth in last year's League A.

    In this league, teams have begun to pay attention to improving their serving, receiving, and blocking techniques, and their offensive awareness has been greatly enhanced. These aspects were the common weaknesses of all teams last year. In the Shanghai women's team's victory over the Beijing team in the first stage of the Tianjin competition, the Shanghai team scored thirty-one points from serves, including twenty points from powerful serves. This large number is equivalent to winning more than one or two sets. The power of Guangzhou men's team's powerful serves was an important factor in their victories during the competition.

    One or two years ago, teams frequently made blocking errors. In last year's League A, some teams had blocking error rates of around 90%. Now, teams have generally improved in this area. Blocking errors into the net have been greatly reduced, and the success rate of blocking has significantly improved. What is even more gratifying is the rapid progress made by women's teams in this regard. The "August 1st," Chengdu, Shenyang, Beijing, and Shanghai teams can now block almost every ball, and the effect is very good. In a match between the Public Security Sports Association men's team and the Wuhan team, the Public Security Sports Association team blocked or directly scored thirty-eight times out of seventy-six blocks. Blocking fouls and errors also occurred thirty-eight times, with gains and losses evenly split, which was rarely seen in the past.

    In this league, both men's and women's teams have made varying degrees of improvement in their receiving techniques. According to preliminary statistics, the average percentage of successful "first passes" has increased from 60% to 65% last year to 70% to 75%. Many players use the back of their hands or fists to receive low and fast serves or spikes. This underhand dig can not only avoid holding fouls but also bounce the ball very high, creating good offensive opportunities.

    Now that powerful serves are becoming more and more fierce, the requirements for the "first pass" are also getting higher and higher. The speed of improvement in receiving techniques is currently not as fast as the progress of aggressive serves, which sometimes still leads to a passive situation of consecutive point losses. For example, one of the main reasons for the Beijing men's team's defeat to the Guangzhou team was that many "first passes" were not ideal, resulting in more points lost. Because some teams have not yet mastered the "first pass" well enough, the development of tactical diversification has also been affected. Therefore, the tactics of "two-touch offense" (passing only once before spiking) and "quick set feint" are still rare.

    Among the general improvement of teams' techniques this year, it is particularly noteworthy that some new teams and new figures have emerged. The Tianjin women's team and the Jiangxi men's team were both promoted from last year's League B. Although they did not score many points in the competition, it can be seen at a glance that these two teams have great potential and are a force to be reckoned with.

### 全国排球甲级联赛第一循环赛

    全国排球甲级联赛第一循环赛
    新华社记者　陆左平
    1958年全国排球甲级联赛第一循环经过在天津、武汉和上海一百四十八场比赛以后，已经结束。这一循环的比赛，给人们留下了一个突出的印象，参加比赛的男女各队在战术、技术方面进步极快，所谓那个队在技术上保持有“绝对优势”的说法，已被打破。
    去年男子第三名的广州队在联赛中接连地把去年冠军“八一”队和亚军北京队打败。而“八一”队是建队以来在国内联赛中从来没有失败过的。拥有四个运动健将的北京男子队不仅输给了广州队，也输给了去年联赛第六名的成都队。刚从去年乙级队升上的江西队，在同北京、“八一”两队比赛时，每场也都能获胜一局，而且江西队还战胜了去年甲级队联赛第六名成都队。
    在这次联赛中，各队已经开始重视发球，接发球和拦网的技术的改进，进攻意识大大加强，而这些方面正是去年各队共同的弱点。在第一阶段天津比赛的上海女子队胜北京队这一场，上海队曾以发球获得三十一分，其中大力发球得二十分，这样巨大的数字相等于赢了一局以上到两局的分数。广州男子队的大力发球的威力，就是他们在比赛时所以获胜的重要因素之一。
    一两年前，各队拦网失误的情况非常多，在去年甲级队联赛中有的队拦网失误竟达到90％左右。现在各队在这方面普遍有了提高。拦网过网的现象大为减少，拦网的成功率有明显的提高，更可喜的是女子队在这方面有飞速的进步，“八一”、成都、沈阳、北京、上海等队，已能有球必拦，而且效果很好。公安体协男子队对武汉队的一场比赛中，公安体协队在七十六次拦网中，拦到球或直接得分的共三十八次，拦网犯规和失误的共三十八次，得失各占一半，这也是过去所少见的。
    在这次联赛中，不论男女各队在接发球的技术上也都有了不同程度的改进。根据初步统计，各队“第一传”传到位的平均百分率，从去年60％到65％已提高为70％到75％。有许多队员运用了手背合掌或拳头接应对方发来或扣来又低又急的球，这种下手垫球不仅可以避免持球犯规，而且能把球弹得很高，组成很好的进攻的机会。
    现在大力发球越来越猛，相对地对“第一传”的要求也越来越高，接发球技术提高的速度目前不如攻击性发球进步的快，有时仍然造成连续失分的被动局面。例如北京男子队败给广州队很大的原因之一，就是许多“第一传”不够理想，失分较多。由于有些队“第一传”还掌握不够，也就影响了战术多样化的开展，所以应用“两下球”（只传一次，即行扣球）与“快球掩护”的战术还是很少。
    在今年各队技术普遍提高中，值得特别注意的是出现了一些新队伍、新人物。天津女子队、江西男子队都是去年乙级队升上的，比赛得分虽然不多，但是一眼就可以看出，这两个队的潜力很大，后生可畏。
