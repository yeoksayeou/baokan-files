    The Fire of "Double-Oppositions" Burns Fiercely; Flowers of Rectification Bloom Everywhere
    **A Big-Character Poster Demolishes the "Condition Theory"**
    The fact that passenger trains on the Harbin-Changchun line will shorten their journey by half an hour is an exciting and heartening event that has emerged from the "Double-Opposition" campaign in the Harbin Railway Bureau.
    In early January of this year, the Sanke Tree Locomotive Depot of the Harbin Railway Administration initially planned to shorten passenger train travel time on the Harbin-Changchun line by twelve minutes when drawing up the summer operating schedule. However, some people at the time believed that the conditions on the Harbin-Changchun line were different and that this was impossible.
    In early March, the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement began to burn like wildfire in the locomotive depot. Lin Peiyang, a fireman in the depot, put up a big-character poster. In the poster, he recounted an experience he had while on duty. While passing through the Zhongde station on the Harbin-Changchun line, he dropped the route marker, which delayed them by ten minutes. Later, they increased the speed and finally arrived in Changchun on time. He used this example to criticize the leadership's conservative thinking. The Sanke Tree Locomotive Depot took this big-character poster seriously and decided to conduct a trial run under the leadership of Liu Fuqing, the depot chief, and Lian Wenbin, the driver instructor. A total of six trial runs were conducted, confirming that it was entirely possible to arrive half an hour ahead of schedule. Faced with the facts, those with conservative ideas made self-criticisms, and the advanced targets were affirmed.
              (Huang Han, Chang Cheng)
    **What a Huge Document**
    "On September 4, 1957, the Jilin Provincial Culture Bureau issued a 'Notice on Revising the Provisional Measures for the Registration and Management of Folk Professional Quyi Performers in Jilin Province' and attached a sample of a 'Temporary Performance Certificate' to be printed by each county. The dimensions of this 'Temporary Performance Certificate' sample were: 45 cm wide and 60 cm high; the stub was 30 cm wide and 60 cm high. Both combined were larger than a 'People's Daily' newspaper. When the counties received the notice, they were very surprised and said: 'A temporary performance certificate' is a document that is carried with you, why does it need to be so big? They wrote to the Provincial Culture Bureau to inquire and only then did they clarify the problem: the drafter had miscalculated the dimensions. However, despite the document going through layers of procedures such as review by the section chief, approval by the bureau chief, as well as typing and proofreading, no one noticed this error." This is an example of bureaucracy in government work. This is one of the various examples of bureaucracy exposed by units in the Jilin Provincial People's Committee system during the "Double-Opposition" movement.
    **Many New Rural Events: Provincial Governor Pushes a Manure Cart**
    On the morning of March 19, the golden sunlight shone on the Ju Xi River in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province. Two young men, covered in sweat, sat on the bank, with two fully loaded carts of earth and manure parked beside them, indicating that they had just sat down to rest.
    At this time, comrades from the Provincial Party Committee's agricultural inspection team, who had come to Xinzhou, happened to pass by here. Zhang Tixue, the provincial governor who led the team, and Li Minghao, the deputy provincial governor, saw the two young men and started talking to them:
    "Where are you from?" Governor Zhang asked.
    "Members of the Qinlao No. 2 Cooperative of Dadu Township."
    "What are you doing here?"
    "Hauling manure back home from the county seat."
    "Ah, we're going the same way, we're also going to Liuji and Dadu Townships. How about we help you pull these two carts of manure back?"
    "That would be great." The two young men looked at each other with a smile. Before the words were even finished, the two governors and other comrades of the inspection team pushed the manure carts. The two governors, one in front and one behind, each pulled a cart very quickly, and with a burst of energy, they pulled the carts over the embankment and all the way to Liuji Township before stopping. Xu Zhengli, the secretary of the township Party branch, saw this and said to the two young men with both excitement and reproach: "You know how to enjoy yourselves, even making the governor help you pull the cart!" This surprised the two young men. They wanted to say a word of thanks, but the governor had already gone to the fields to inspect the wheat seedlings!
    **Rectification Eliminates Old Work Styles: Workshop Director Becomes Popular**
    "You're so bureaucratic! I've mentioned the problem of the poor clay material to you so many times, but you just won't solve it!" Whenever Yan Xisheng, the director of the raw material workshop of the Tangshan Sanheyi Porcelain Factory, went to the molding workshop in the past, he would be criticized by the workers like this.
    At that time, Yan Xisheng always felt somewhat wronged: the factory director wouldn't install a large mill, and the supply and marketing department couldn't buy good raw materials, how could he be blamed?
    When the rectification started, the workers put up several big-character posters about him. He realized that it was wrong to only emphasize objective reasons and not examine his own thinking. He then personally went out to purchase raw materials. Once, he ate a little food in the morning, took two steamed buns, and rode his bicycle for 200 li, and climbed 40 or 50 li of mountain road to purchase raw materials in another place. Although he was very tired from the trip, and didn't even drink a sip of water all day, he was still in high spirits.
    After the raw materials were transported to the factory, he worked with the workers on the material selection and testing. Because there was no fixed standard for material selection, he selected different material samples to be fired and studied with everyone, so that everyone mastered the material selection standards. In this way, he gained the love and welcome of the workers.
    **Nanchang Tax Bureau Rectifies While Doing: Bureau Chiefs and Section Chiefs Manage Taxpayers**
    The three bureau chiefs and deputy bureau chiefs, and the section chiefs and deputy section chiefs of the Nanchang City Tax Bureau in Jiangxi Province are determined to eliminate "officialdom" and have begun to implement experimental management of taxpayers. They selected taxpayers from different industries. Deputy Bureau Chief Tang Yuansheng officially took over the tax work of the Diesel Engine Factory and the Lianye Dyeing and Weaving Factory in early March. He has now initially grasped the factory's production plan, the production process of products, the laws of production changes, the annual profit turnover, and the basic information of the factory's business, commodities, and stamp tax. They plan to discover and study the changes in different tax categories and commodities through experimental management of taxpayers, summarize experience in a timely manner, and promote it.
    **Party Committee Secretary Takes Apprenticeship**
    One day in March, the workers in the fine spinning workshop of the Shijiazhuang No. 1 State-owned Cotton Factory were handing over shifts when Feng Ye, the secretary of the factory's Party Committee, came and said that he was here to participate in production. The workers were happy to hear this.
    "Great! We welcome you."
    "I don't know anything, I have to be your elementary school student."
    "Let's learn from each other!"
    Old worker Chen Guilan was a coach, so Feng Ye took her as his teacher. He told Guilan that he would learn to watch a machine within three months and master the basic movements of fine spinning. Guilan said that she would do her best to help Comrade Feng Ye achieve his goal ahead of schedule.
    Production began, and Chen Guilan, holding a yarn tube, first taught Feng Ye to practice the carding action. Feng Ye practiced for about two hours and basically mastered the basic action. Then Chen Guilan taught Feng Ye to learn tube removal and splicing techniques. Chen Guilan lectured and taught like teaching an elementary school student. When Feng Ye spliced his first end, Chen Guilan smiled with satisfaction. (Attached picture)
    The employees on the grain supply front in Baoding City, Hebei Province, boldly reformed the business system and basically eliminated the phenomenon of queuing to buy grain. The picture shows Sang Yingshan, a salesperson from the Langshan Street Grain Supply Station, who heard that Jin Yuying, a resident of Zihetao, had given birth and no one was available to buy grain, so he sent the grain to her home.

    双反烈火熊熊燃  整改鲜花处处开
    一张大字报攻垮了“条件论”
    哈长线的旅客列车将缩短半个多小时到达目的地，这是哈尔滨铁路局在双反中出现的一件振奋人心的好事。
    今年1月初，哈尔滨铁路管理局三棵树机务段在编制夏季运行图时，曾确定哈长线旅客列车缩短十二分钟。可是当时有人认为哈长线条件不同不可能。
    3月初，反浪费反保守运动在机务段像烈火燎原般地燃烧起来。这个段的司炉林培阳贴出一张大字报。他在大字报中讲述了自己有一次执行乘务，在哈长线的中德车站通过时，掉了路牌，误了十分钟的时间，后来加快了运行速度，终于正点到达了长春。他举出这个事例来，批评了领导上的保守思想。这张大字报引起了三棵树机务段的重视，决定由段长刘福庆、指导司机练文彬负责领导进行试运。前后一共进行了六次试运，证实提前半个钟头到达目的地完全可能。在事实面前，有保守思想的人作了检讨，先进的指标被肯定了下来。
              （黄汉、常诚）
    好大的证件
    “1957年9月4日，吉林省文化局发出一个‘关于修改吉林省民间职业曲艺艺人登记管理暂行办法的通知’并且附去一份‘临时演出证’的样本，要各县自行印刷。这个‘临时演出证’样本的尺码是：宽四十五公分，竖六十公分；存根宽三十公分，竖六十公分。两张加在一起，比一张‘人民日报’还大。县里接到通知后，感到非常惊讶，他们说：‘临时演出证’是随身携带的证件，怎么要用这么大呢？写信向省文化局询问，才把问题弄清楚，原来是拟稿人将尺码计算错了。可是，这个文件尽管经过科长核稿、局长签发、以及打字、校对等层层手续，可是，这个错误却谁也没有发现。”这是一种机关工作中的文牍主义。这是吉林省人民委员会系统各单位在“双反”运动中揭发出来形形色色文牍主义中的一个例子。
    农村新事多省长推粪车
    3月19日上午，金色的阳光照射在湖北省新洲县举西大河上。岸边坐着两个满头大汗的小伙子，身旁停放着两乘满装土粪的大车，看得出他们是刚刚坐下来休息的。
    这时，到新洲来的省委农业检查团的同志们，刚好从这里经过。带队的张体学省长和李明灏副省长看见两个小伙子，就同他们谈了起来：
    “你们是那里人呀？”张省长问。
    “大渡乡勤劳二社社员。”
    “到这儿干什么呀？”
    “到县城搬粪回家去。”
    “啊，同路人啦，我们也是到刘集、大渡两乡去的。这两车粪就让我们帮忙拉回去好吗？”
    “那太好了。”两个小伙子笑眯眯的彼此望了一下。话音还未落，两位省长和检查团的其他同志便把粪车推了起来。两位省长一前一后地各拉着一乘走得很快，一鼓劲就把车子拉着翻过大堤，一直拉到刘集乡才停下来。乡党总支书记徐正利看见，又兴奋又带着责备的口吻对两个小伙子说：“你们倒会享福，还要省长帮忙拉车啦！”这使两个小伙子很惊奇，想说句感谢话，可是省长已到畈上检查麦苗去了！
    整改整掉旧作风车间主任受欢迎
    “你真官僚！泥料不好使的问题，给你提过多少次了，就是不给解决！”唐山三合义磁厂原料车间主任阎锡盛，过去一到成型车间，就遭到工人这样批评。
    那时，阎锡盛总觉得自己有些冤枉：厂长不给安大磨，供销股买不来好原料，这能怪我吗？
    整改开始时，工人们给他贴了好几张大字报。他认识到只强调客观原因，不检查自己的思想是不对的。他便亲自出马到处奔走采购原料。一次，他早晨吃了点饭，带上两个馍馍，骑上自行车，跑了二百里路，还爬了四、五十里山路，到外地去采购原料。虽然跑得很累，一天到晚连一口水都没喝上，但情绪还很饱满。
    原料运进厂后，他和工人一起做选料试样工作。由于选料没有固定标准，他就选出不同的料样烧出来，和大家一起研究，使大家都掌握了选料标准。这样他就受到了工人的爱戴和欢迎。
    南昌税局边整边改  局长科长管理税户
    江西省南昌市税务局三个正副局长和正副科长决心打掉“官气”，已开始实行试验管理税户。他们分别不同行业选择税户，副局长唐源生同志已于3月初正式接管了柴油机厂和联业染织厂的税务工作，现在已初步摸到厂方生产计划、产品的生产过程、生产变化规律、每年上缴利润及厂的营业、商货、印花税等基本情况。他们准备通过试验管理税户，发现和研究不同税种和商品的变化情况，及时总结经验，加以推广。
    党委书记　拜师学艺
    3月间的一天，石家庄国棉一厂细纱车间的工人们正在交接班，厂党委书记冯烨同志来了，他说是来参加生产的。工人们一听都乐了。
    “好啊！我们欢迎你。”
    “我什么也不会，得当你们的小学生。”
    “咱们互相学习吧！”
    老工人陈桂兰是个教练员，冯烨就拜他为师。他向桂兰表示：三个月内学会看一台车，熟练细纱的基本动作。桂兰表示要尽最大的努力，帮助冯烨同志提前达到目的。
    生产开始了，陈桂兰拿着纱管，先教冯烨练习卡头动作。冯烨练习了大约两个钟头，基本动作就学会了。接着陈桂兰又教冯烨学习拔管和接头技术。陈桂兰一边讲一边教，像教小学生一样。当冯烨接上了第一根头的时候，陈桂兰满意的笑了。（附图片）
    河北省保定市粮食供应战线上的职工，大胆地改革了营业制度，基本上消灭了排队买粮的现象。图为琅珊街粮食供应站听说紫河套居民靳玉英生了孩子没人买粮，便派营业员桑英山把粮食送到她家去。
