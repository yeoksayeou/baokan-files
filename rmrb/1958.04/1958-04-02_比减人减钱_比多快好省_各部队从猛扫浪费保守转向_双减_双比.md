Xinhua News Agency: From Sweeping Away Waste and Conservatism to "Double Reduction" and "Double Competition"

A responsible person from the General Political Department's Rectification Office of the Chinese People's Liberation Army told Xinhua News Agency reporters about the army's "Double-Anti" movement: After the liberation army units posted over 160 million big-character posters attacking waste, encircling and suppressing conservatism, and sweeping away all backward phenomena, the army's ideological outlook and work style have undergone significant changes. Currently, this magnificent movement is deepening into double reduction (reducing personnel, reducing money) and double competition (competing for advanced status, competing for more, faster, better, and more economical results).

The responsible person said that at present, the political enthusiasm of all officers and soldiers has greatly increased, and many individualistic problems have disappeared. Many officers go deep into the companies and live, eat, and work with the soldiers. Colonels and division leaders serve as company commanders, and division political commissars serve as privates to manage "experimental plots." Generals take the lead in crawling and fighting, studying hard and practicing diligently. Many office cadres go down to the companies to serve as soldiers for training. Many soldiers voluntarily request to lower supply standards and pay attention to economy in everything. They don't throw away even a grain of rice or a leaf of vegetable in the dining hall. Many problems that had not been resolved in the past have been smoothly resolved in the movement. Large numbers of officers' family members have returned to their hometowns to engage in production, and officers who have transferred to civilian work are gradually embarking on the labor production front. Many old rules have been broken through by the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, and advanced indicators have appeared in various tasks. Without adding people or money, the railway corps' target for railway construction per division per year has increased by 60% to 100%. Many units of the army, navy, and air force have proposed to complete this year's training tasks several months ahead of schedule, or to add subjects in addition to the prescribed training subjects. Now, they are still training in adverse weather conditions.

The responsible person said that from the "Double-Anti" movement, it can be seen that the army has many avenues and great potential in reducing personnel, reducing money, and supporting socialist construction. The main targets for personnel reduction are organs and schools. The army organs are still relatively large, and some organs can reduce half the number of people without affecting work. The organization and personnel of the schools can be greatly streamlined, and some schools can reduce more than 70%. Particularly worthy of promotion is the method of organizing collaboration among units in the same area. For example, after consultation, several schools and units stationed in a certain area of Hebei Province merged five hospitals and four clinics for joint use; four military printing factories were merged into two, which can reduce production costs by 10%; thirteen film projection teams were merged into eight, which can reduce fourteen projectionists and ten projectors. In terms of reducing money, the General Logistics Department, after preliminary accounting, found that several expenses can be reduced by an average of 8%. Various military regions and various services and arms are also tapping potential and trying to find ways to further reduce the budget. The railway corps proposed to be completely self-sufficient in funding and strive to hand over profits to the state. In terms of supporting socialist construction, the entire army originally planned to support production and construction with 30 million labor days this year, but now many units have exceeded the plan. Many units have also formulated plans to comprehensively support socialist construction, such as reclaiming wasteland, building reservoirs, building power stations, building roads, and greening the stationed areas.

The responsible person finally said that the army's "Double-Anti" movement is deepening and meticulously turning to "double reduction" and "double competition," striving to both blossom beautifully and bear good fruit. Now, all units are continuing to mobilize the masses to find reasons, think of ways, calculate accounts, and conduct evaluations, and after debates and trial runs, they are formulating individual, unit, and departmental leap forward plans and specific measures to ensure that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is implemented in sustained practical action.

    比减人减钱　比多快好省
    各部队从猛扫浪费保守转向“双减”“双比”
    据新华社讯　中国人民解放军总政治部整风办公室负责人向新华社记者谈军队“双反”运动的情况说：解放军各部队在一亿六千多万张大字报猛攻浪费、围歼保守、横扫一切落后现象以后，全军的思想面貌和工作作风有了重大改变，目前这一波澜壮阔的运动正在向双减（减人、减钱）和双比（比先进、比多快好省）方面深入发展中。
    负责人说，目前全军官兵的政治积极性大大提高，许多个人主义问题销声匿迹。许多军官深入连队和士兵同吃、同住、同劳动。大校师长当连长、师政委当列兵搞“试验田”。将军带头摸爬滚打、苦学苦练。不少机关干部下连当兵进行锻炼。不少战士自动要求降低供给标准，处处注意节约，在饭堂里连一粒米饭、一片菜叶都不扔。许多过去没有解决的问题，在运动中顺利解决了。军官家属大批还乡生产，转业复员的军官正在陆续走上劳动生产战线。许多陈规已被群众的热情和积极性所冲破，各项工作都出现了先进指标。在不加人不加钱的情况下，铁道兵每师每年修铁路的指标增加了60％到一倍。陆海空军许多部队都提出提前几个月完成今年度的训练任务，或者在规定的训练科目以外再增加科目。现在遇到恶劣气候照样练兵。
    负责人说，从“双反”运动中可以看出，军队在减人、减钱、支援社会主义建设等方面，门路很多，潜力很大。减人的对象主要是机关和学校。军队机关目前还是比较庞大的，有些机关可以减去一半人数而不影响工作。学校的机构和人员更可以大大紧缩，某些学校可以减少70％以上。特别值得提倡的是同一地区各部队单位组织协作的办法。例如：驻河北省某地的几个学校和部队经过协商，就将五个医院和四个门诊部加以合并使用；四个部队印刷厂合并成两个，生产成本可以降低10％；十三个电影放映组合并成八个，可以减少放映员十四人，放映机十台。在减钱方面，总后勤部经过初步核算，有几项费用可以平均削减8％。各军区和各军种、兵种也都在挖潜力想办法进一步削减预算。铁道兵提出经费全部自给，还争取向国家上缴利润。在支援社会主义建设方面，全军今年原定以三千万个劳动日支援生产建设，现在许多部队都突破了计划。许多部队还订出了开荒、修水库、修发电站、修公路、绿化驻区等全面支援社会主义建设的规划。
    这位负责人最后说，军队“双反”运动正深入、细致地转向“双减”和“双比”方面去，求得既开好花又结好果。现在各部队都在继续发动群众找原因、想办法、算账、评比，经过辩论和摸底试验，订出个人的、单位的、部门的跃进计划和具体措施，务使群众的革命积极性贯彻到持久的实际行动中去。
