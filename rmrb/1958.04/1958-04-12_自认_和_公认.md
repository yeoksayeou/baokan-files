    “Self-Recognition” and “Public Recognition”
    Shu Hong
    In the rectification movement among Shanghai's neighborhood residents, there was such an incident: A grain store clerk, who usually considered himself to be actively working, was confident that the masses would have no opinions about him. However, to his surprise, many residents posted big-character posters criticizing him. Residents of No. 153 Shanhai Pass Road alone posted over a hundred of them. Some big-character posters criticized his blunt service attitude, and others criticized him for being irresponsible in his work.
    There are many cadres similar to this clerk. They always think that their work is done well, and that the masses have no opinions about them. What is the basis for this? It is "self-recognition." Facts prove that whether a cadre's work is done well or not can never be based on "self-recognition," but should be based on "public recognition" by the masses. Often, what is "self-recognized" as good turns out to be bad, or even very bad, when "publicly recognized" by the masses. This shows that our cadres and our work should be placed under the supervision of the masses. Without this kind of supervision, cadres will develop problems, and they will not even be aware of the problems when they occur.
    No one will object to the idea that our cadres should be subject to the supervision of the masses, but how do we obtain the supervision of the masses? The key does not lie with the masses, but with the cadres. It lies in whether the cadres can get along with the masses as equals, truly treat the masses as their relatives and friends, and also make the masses treat the cadres as their relatives and friends, so that the masses do not respect and stay away from the cadres, but are close to and near to them. This is very important. The vast majority of our cadres are respected by the masses, but many cadres are not close to the masses, precisely because they have a little more bureaucratic air and a little less popular air, making it difficult for the masses to get close to them, and they are not comfortable raising opinions at any time.
    The purpose of the rectification movement is to rectify bureaucratic air and promote popular air, so that the relationship between cadres and the masses can truly reach a level of blending like water and milk, and close and inseparable, just like the atmosphere of the rectification movement in Shanghai's neighborhoods. In this way, the masses will raise any opinions at any time, and cadres will be able to correct any shortcomings at any time. This kind of supervision is the most extensive, most frequent, and most effective supervision. Every ambitious cadre should strive to obtain this kind of supervision from the masses.

    “自认”和“公认”
    舒宏
    在上海市里弄居民整风中，有这样一件事：一个米店营业员，平时自认为工作积极，满以为群众不会对他有什么意见，谁知出乎他的意外，很多居民都给他贴了大字报，仅仅山海关路一五三弄居民就给他贴了一百多张。有的大字报批评他服务态度生硬，有的大字报批评他工作不负责任。
    类似这位营业员的干部大有人在。他们总是认为自己的工作作得不错，认为群众对自己没有什么意见。根据何在？就是“自己认为”。事实证明，任何一个干部工作做得究竟好还是不好，决不能“自认”，应该让群众去“公认”。往往“自认”很好，而让群众一公认，不好了，甚至很糟。这说明，我们的干部，我们的工作，应该放在群众的监督之下。没有这种监督，干部就会发生毛病，而且发生了毛病都不自觉。
    我们的干部应该受群众监督，这一点谁都不会反对，但是怎样取得群众的监督呢？关键并不在群众，而在干部。在于干部是不是能和群众平等相处，真正把群众当做自己的亲人和朋友，也使群众把干部当做自己的亲人和朋友，使群众对干部不是敬而远之，而是亲而近之。这一点很重要。我们绝大多数干部，群众是敬佩的，但不少干部群众却并不亲近，就是因为他们身上多了一点官气，少了一点民气，使群众不大好亲近他们，有意见也就不大好随时提出了。
    整风的目的就是要整掉官气，发扬民气，使干部和群众的关系真正达到水乳交融、亲密无间的程度，像上海的里弄整风就很有这种气象。这样，群众有什么意见就会随时提出来，干部有什么毛病也就能随时改掉了，这种监督才是最广泛、最经常、最有效的监督，每一个有志气的干部，都应该努力争取得到群众这种监督。
