This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 16th: A type of concrete that can save large amounts of cement and timber while accelerating the progress of construction projects – special dry-hard concrete with a working strength of 200 to 300 seconds – has been successfully trialed at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's United Processing Plant.

From the 7th to the 12th, the plant's workers used this concrete to produce the first batch of 14-meter-long I-shaped reinforced concrete columns for the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's primary rolling mill, which is under large-scale construction. After evaluation, the columns produced in this way have a smooth and flat surface, fewer internal voids, and higher compressive strength than ordinary dry-hard concrete components, fully meeting quality requirements.

Special dry-hard concrete has a greatly reduced water content compared to ordinary dry-hard concrete, thus enhancing the density of the concrete and increasing its strength rapidly. This can greatly shorten the curing time and save a large amount of cement. Compared with the commonly used concrete with a working strength of 30 seconds in China, each cubic meter of special dry-hard concrete can save 70 to 100 kilograms of cement, a reduction of 22% to 31%; the curing time can be reduced from 14 days to 7 days. This concrete sets quickly, and the formwork can be removed immediately after pouring, thus saving a large amount of wooden formwork. At the same time, the use of this concrete in winter construction eliminates the need for special curing equipment such as steam curing and electrical heating.

Tests have proven that this concrete can be widely used in prefabricated concrete components; it can also be selectively used in cast-in-place concrete structures. In the current situation of cement shortage in our country, using this cement is the best way to carry out construction quickly and well.

The successful trial of this special dry-hard concrete is a major innovation in construction technology in our country. In the past, many people believed that our existing vibrating and mixing equipment could not produce higher-grade concrete. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's United Processing Plant learned from the spirit of steelworkers experimenting with tapping steel from three furnaces simultaneously. The plant director, Party committee secretary, and engineers, together with the prefabricated workshop workers, studied and improved the equipment and operating methods, and adopted a "layered and segmented" vibration method to overcome the operational difficulties brought about by low moisture content and high rigidity. They also created an attached vibrator, thus improving the quality of this concrete.

### 建筑技术上的重大革新  太原钢铁厂试制成功特殊干硬性混凝土  又省水泥　又省木材　又能加速工程进度

    建筑技术上的重大革新
    太原钢铁厂试制成功特殊干硬性混凝土
    又省水泥　又省木材　又能加速工程进度
    本报太原16日电　一项既能节约大量水泥、木材又能加速建筑工程进度的混凝土——二百秒到三百秒工作强度的特殊干硬性混凝土，已在太原钢铁厂联合加工厂试制成功。
    7日到12日，这个厂的职工们用这种混凝土，为正在大规模施工的太原钢铁厂初轧车间制成了第一批长达十四公尺的工字形钢筋混凝土柱。经过鉴定，这样制成的柱子表面平整、光滑，内部空隙少，抗压力也比普通干硬性混凝土构件高，完全合乎质量要求。
    特殊干硬性混凝土比普通干硬性混凝土含水量大大减少，因此增强了混凝的密实性，强度增长很快，可以大大缩短养生时间并节约大量水泥。如果同我国目前通用的工作强度为三十秒的混凝土比较，每立方公尺特殊干硬性混凝土可以少用水泥七十公斤到一百公斤，即减少22％到31％；养生时间可由十四天减到七天。这种混凝土凝固快，灌浇完毕后当时就能撤模板，因此可以节省大量木模板。同时，冬季利用这种混凝土制作也可以不用蒸气养生、电气加热等特殊的养生设备。
    试验证明，在混凝土预制构件中可以广泛采用这种混凝土；在现场浇灌的混凝土结构，也可以选择采用。在我国目前水泥缺少的情况下，采用这种水泥是又快又好地进行建设的最好途径。
    这种特殊干硬性混凝土试制成功，是我国建筑技术上的重大革新。过去许多人认为我国现有的震捣和搅拌设备不可能生产更高级的混凝土。太原钢铁厂联合加工厂学习炼钢工人试验三槽出钢的精神，工厂厂长、党委书记、工程师同预制工段职工一起，研究改进设备和操作方法，并且采取了“分层分段”震捣法克服了水分少硬性大带来的操作困难，同时创造了附着式震动器，因而提高了这种混凝土的质量。
