    Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Publication of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People"
    Chinese Philosophical Society and Institute of Philosophy to Hold Academic Symposium

    (Our newspaper's report) The Chinese Philosophical Society and the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to commemorate the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," will jointly invite philosophy workers in the capital to hold a three-day academic symposium from May 2nd to 4th. Since its official publication on June 19th last year, Chairman Mao's work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" has been widely studied and discussed among the people, cadres, and in academic circles. In particular, after the rectification campaign, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the "Double-Anti" movement, due to the further clarification of the distinction between ourselves and the enemy, the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the overcoming of conservative thinking, and the boosting of enthusiasm, a high tide of the Great Leap Forward has emerged, thereby further enhancing and deepening the understanding of Chairman Mao's work. The upcoming symposium will mainly focus on the philosophical issues raised in Chairman Mao's work, combined with the current revolutionary practice in our country, especially in connection with the new situation of the current nationwide Great Leap Forward; in the spirit of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, theoretical expositions and discussions will be carried out from all aspects. And we plan to publish a collection of discussions.

    本报讯　中国哲学会和中国科学院哲学研究所，为纪念毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表一周年，将于5月2日至4日，联合邀请首都哲学工作者，举行学术座谈会三天。毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”这一著作，自去年6月19日正式发表以来，在人民群众和干部中间，以及在学术界，都进行了广泛的学习和讨论。特别是经过整风、反右派斗争和“双反”运动以后，由于进一步分清了敌我界线，正确地处理了人民内部矛盾，克服了保守思想和鼓起了干劲，出现了全民大跃进的高潮，从而进一步提高和加深了对毛主席这一著作的体会。即将举行的座谈会，主要根据毛主席这一著作中所提出的哲学问题，结合我国当前的革命实践，特别是联系当前全民大跃进的新形势；本着百家争鸣的精神，从各方面进行理论上的阐述和讨论。并准备出版讨论专辑。
