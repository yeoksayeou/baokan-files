    Xinjiang's Several Counties are Massively Transforming Alkaline Land
    (From our newspaper) Farmers in many areas of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are vigorously transforming saline-alkali land to strive for increased grain production.
    Farmers in Bachu County, Kashgar Prefecture, are adopting methods such as digging drainage ditches, using sweet soil to suppress alkali, washing alkali with water, and harrowing to comprehensively combat soil salinization and strive to achieve this year's Great Leap Forward plan. In the work of alkali treatment, Hao Fengtian, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, personally went to the front line, took off his shoes and socks, and dug drainage ditches with members of agricultural cooperatives in the first district and eighth township, which quickly launched the alkali treatment campaign throughout the township.
    Bachu County is located at the lower reaches of the Yarkand River and the Kashgar River, with low-lying terrain and severe soil salinization every spring. This year, each district promptly summarized the local farmers' years of experience in alkali treatment, and after the land thawed in late February, they led the masses to fully launch alkali treatment activities.
    The farmland in Kuerle, Yuli, and Qiemo counties of Kuerle Prefecture mainly relies on the Peacock River and Qiemo River for irrigation. Because the land along the banks of the river is low-lying, the water level is high, and due to poor management, most of the irrigation methods adopted are serial irrigation and flooding irrigation, which greatly damages the soil and causes soil salinization. There are 162,000 mu of saline-alkali land in the entire prefecture's five counties. In order to turn low-yielding fields into high-yielding fields and continuously advance agriculture, the prefecture is determined to work hard for three years to eliminate saline-alkali land.

    新疆几个县大面积改造碱地
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区许多地区的农民正在大力改造盐碱地，争取粮食增产。
    喀什专区巴楚县农民正采取挖排碱沟、用甜土压碱和用水洗碱、耙耱等方法，全面展开治理土壤盐碱化的活动，力争实现今年大跃进计划。在治碱工作中，县委第一书记郝丰田亲临阵地，脱了鞋袜和一区八乡农业社社员一块挖排碱沟，使全乡治碱运动迅速开展起来。
    巴楚县位于叶尔羌河和喀什噶尔河的最下游，地势低洼，每年春季土壤盐碱化现象十分严重。今年，各区及时总结了当地农民多年来的治碱经验，从2月下旬土地解冻后，即领导群众全面展开治碱活动。
    库尔勒专区的库尔勒、尉犁、且末三县的农田主要依靠孔雀河和且末河灌溉。由于沿河两岸的土地较低洼，水位高，加之管理不善，大都采取串灌、漫灌等灌溉方法，对土壤损害很大，造成土壤盐碱化。全专区五个县就有盐碱地十六万二千亩。为了变低产田为高产田，使农业不断跃进，这个专区决心苦战三年，消灭盐碱地。
