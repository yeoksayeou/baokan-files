The Inspiration of the Xinghua Experience

We knew some time ago that the rapeseed production in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, was very high last year, becoming the first in the country. But, who knows how many difficulties the people of Xinghua faced from nature! In the rapeseed producing area of Xinghua, there is so much water that production depends entirely on boats, with no cars or horses. Secondly, during the rapeseed sowing season, the temperature often drops to minus ten degrees Celsius. The people of Xinghua created a high-yield record under such difficult natural conditions, making its name known to the people of the whole country. The people of Xinghua have a very tenacious spirit in overcoming difficulties, and this alone is worth learning from. However, what needs to be particularly pointed out is the set of detailed rapeseed yield-increasing experiences they have created. They created polders according to local conditions, and have developed a set of methods in the processes of seedling cultivation, transplanting, fertilization, harvesting, and turning and drying. In their hands, rapeseed is almost like a baby, and every cold, warm, hunger, or chill will receive timely care from the mother. After reading their experiences, one feels that even the worst land, as long as hard work is put in, will always yield more and more harvests.

If every region could carefully explore a set of experiences for its main crops, like Xinghua, and understand crops like a mother understands her child, then every place would get greater harvests!

    兴化经验的启示
    我们早一些日子便知道江苏兴化县去年的油菜产量很高，成为全国第一。但是，有谁知道老天爷给了兴化人民那么多的困难啊！在兴化的油菜产区，那里水多得连生产的时候全靠行船，无车无马。其次，在油菜下种季节里气温常常低到零下十几度。兴化人民就在这样困难的自然条件下创造了高产纪录，使全国人民都知道了它的名字。兴化人民战胜困难的精神很顽强，单这一点就值得大家学习。但是，特别需要提出来的，却是他们创造的那一套细致的油菜增产经验。他们因地制宜地创造了垛田，并且在育苗、移植、施肥、收割、翻晒等等过程中都有了一套办法。油菜在他们手里几乎像是一个婴儿，一冷一暖、乍饥乍寒都会得到母亲及时的照拂。读了他们那些经验，便感到：即使是再坏的土地，只要付出了艰苦的劳动，总会得到越来越多的收获。
    如果每个地区对自己种的主要作物，都能像兴化那样，认真地摸索出一套经验，像母亲理解自己的孩子那样理解作物，那么各个地方都会得到更大的丰收！
