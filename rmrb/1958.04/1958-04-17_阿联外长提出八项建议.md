Arab League Foreign Minister Presents Eight Proposals

Fazil suggested that the participating countries of the conference adopt a resolution to: (1) Reaffirm confidence in the principles of the United Nations; (2) Emphasize support for the right of all dependent people to exercise their self-determination and independence; (3) Reiterate adherence to the resolutions of the Bandung Conference; (4) Express support for the rights of Arabs in Palestine; (5) Support the right of Algeria to independence; (6) Demand the adoption of policies and measures to rapidly transform the principles of force and domination of others in international relations into principles of law and cooperation; (7) Emphasize the urgent need to control armaments, ban the production and testing of nuclear weapons, and advocate the right of all countries in the world to enjoy full representation in all important disarmament conferences; (8) Demand that leaders of all countries, large and small, conduct more frequent talks and consultations to seek peace, as well as the prosperity, happiness, and glory of mankind.

The speech of Sudanese Foreign Minister Mahjoub was mostly an elaboration of his country's foreign policy. He said that Sudan's foreign policy is embodied in maintaining neutrality and non-alignment, cooperating with various independent African countries, and encouraging African liberation movements. He called the war waged by France in Algeria "the inevitable result of colonialism, which uses barbaric repressive actions to maintain its position." He demanded that France stop this irrational massacre and grant Algeria independence.

Tunisian Foreign Minister Mokaddem said that Tunisia is continuing its efforts to resolve the Algerian issue, to restore peace in North Africa, and to realize the legitimate aspirations of the Algerian people. He said that his delegation would raise the Algerian issue at the conference, hoping that the conference would take measures to accelerate the resolution of the Algerian issue in a manner that meets everyone's wishes.

Libyan Foreign Minister Wahbi al-Buri also hoped that the conference would take a clear attitude towards the Algerian war and French atrocities. He also called on the people of African countries to strengthen their unity with the people of Asian countries to help get rid of the shackles of colonialism.

Moroccan Foreign Minister Belafrej also condemned the war waged by France in Algeria. He said that the awakening of the African people is the greatest event of our time. He also said that while reiterating the Bandung principles, Morocco is prepared to cooperate and unite with African countries.

Liberian President Tubman spoke of the importance of African people's unity. He called for the use of moral strength to improve the world situation and the welfare of all peoples.
