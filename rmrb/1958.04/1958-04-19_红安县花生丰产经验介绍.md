Hongan County has a fifty-year history of growing peanuts. However, the leap in peanut production has only occurred in recent years. In particular, last year, the county's peanut production reached an average yield of 600 jin per mu, an increase of 533% compared to the early days of liberation, creating an unprecedented large-scale high-yield record in China. At the same time, many high-yield models with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu emerged throughout the county. For example, JianSu Cooperative in Xinghua Township had 142 mu of peanuts with an average yield of 1,065 jin per mu, of which 8 mu averaged 1,256 jin per mu; Lianyi Cooperative in Tainan Township had 30 mu of peanuts with an average yield of 1,280 jin per mu; and Jiangpai First Cooperative had 1.5 mu of peanuts with an average yield of 1,700 jin per mu. According to statistics, there were as many as 3,267 mu of "thousand-jin mu" of peanuts in the county. This year, the county plans to achieve an average peanut yield of 1,000 jin per mu.

The factors contributing to the large-scale high yield of peanuts in Hongan County are multifaceted, among which the most basic factors are: on the basis of conscientiously implementing policies and guidelines and summarizing the masses' high-yield experiences, focusing prominently on several technical aspects of improving production; and adopting leadership methods of unified leadership, dedicated personnel, setting key points at each level, and cadres universally planting "experimental plots," so as to combine leadership with the masses and politics with technology.

The several technical aspects are: early spring plowing, deep plowing and multiple harrowing, soil improvement, and cultivation of soil fertility; applying sufficient base fertilizer, applying fertilizer in layers, applying mixed fertilizer, fertilizing wheat rows for peanuts and wheat forests, and applying topdressing fertilizer based on seedling conditions during the growing period using the "eat little and often" method; selecting 100% of "Hongan Upright Peanuts" as seeds, planting in a timely manner, and planting three seeds per hole to ensure full emergence; planting densely according to local conditions, broadcasting evenly, and ensuring consistency in plant spacing and row spacing; eliminating pests and diseases with revolutionary spirit, grasping the fire color for weeding during cultivation, and mounding soil around the base of the plants. At present, the peanut sowing work in the county has been largely completed. All winter fallow land has been plowed and harrowed three to four times before sowing, generally two to three inches deeper than last year, and the methods of "digging the edges of the land, mixing field soil, carrying pond soil, and spreading pond mud" have been universally adopted to improve the soil. Each agricultural cooperative has used more sufficient base fertilizer than in any previous year, and the seeds have been selected by fruit selection and grain selection before sowing, all of which are "Hongan Upright" varieties. In order to solve the contradiction between peanut and wheat double cropping, the county has also vigorously promoted "peanut nutrient pots." Measures for dense planting according to local conditions have been widely implemented, generally achieving about 12,000 plants per mu in lean land; 6,000 to 8,000 plants per mu in fertile land; and about 10,000 plants per mu in medium land.

    红安县花生丰产经验介绍
    红安县种花生已有五十年的历史。但是花生产量的飞跃提高只是最近几年来的事。特别是在去年，全县的花生产量达到了平均亩产六百斤，比解放初期提高达533％，创造了我国前所未有的大面积高产纪录。同时，全县还出现了许多亩产千斤以上的高额丰产典型。如杏花乡建苏社有一百四十二亩花生平均亩产一千零六十五斤，其中八亩平均亩产一千二百五十六斤；台南乡联谊社有三十亩花生平均亩产一千二百八十斤；姜牌一社有一亩半花生平均亩产一千七百斤。据统计，全县花生“千斤亩”共有三千二百六十七亩之多。今年全县计划花生平均亩产达到千斤。
    红安县花生大面积丰产的因素是多方面的，其中最基本的因素是：在认真贯彻政策、方针和总结群众丰产经验的基础上，突出地抓住几个提高生产的技术环节；并且采取统一领导、专人负责、层层设重点、干部普遍种“试验田”的领导方法，作到领导与群众结合，政治与技术结合。
    几个技术环节是：提早春耕，深耕多耙，改良土壤，培养地力；施足底肥，分层施肥，施混合肥，麦行花生进行麦林施肥，培育期用“少吃多餐”的办法看苗追肥；百分之百地精选“红安直立花生”作种子，适时播种，每壋下种三粒保证全苗；因地密植，均播匀播，株距、行距都作到一致；用革命精神消灭病虫害，抓住火色进行中耕除草，培土壅蔸。目前，全县花生播种工作已大部完成，所有冬闲地在播种前都作到了耕、耙三次到四次，一般比去年深耕了二寸到三寸，并且普遍地采用“挖地边、配田土、挑塘土、铺塘泥”等办法改良了土壤。各农业社底肥都用得比过去任何一年充足，种子在播种前都经过果选和粒选，全部是“红安直立”种。为了解决花生、麦两熟的矛盾，这个县还大力推行了“花生营养钵”。因地密植的措施已普遍推行，一般瘦地作到了每亩一万二千株左右；肥地每亩六千株到八千株；中等地每亩一万株左右。
