Big-Character Poster Delivery Team
    During the "Double-Anti" movement at Tsinghua University, more than 2.1 million big-character posters have been put up. Students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering organized a "Delivery Team" to select and classify the big-character posters and send them to relevant departments. This has changed the phenomenon of the backlog of big-character posters and made it easier for relevant departments to study and solve problems in a timely manner. (Gao Jianian)

    大字报送礼队
    清华大学在双反运动中，大字报已贴了二百数十万张。机械系学生组织了一个“送礼队”，把大字报进行挑选、分类，分别送给有关单位。这就改变了大字报的积压现象，也便于有关单位及时地研究和解决问题。　（高嘉年）
