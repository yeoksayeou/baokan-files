    "Reading" Bi-Monthly Publication
    The "Reading" bi-monthly, transformed from the "Reading Monthly," has published its inaugural issue. The future "Reading" bi-monthly will primarily publish book reviews, adopting a method of focusing on both the best and worst books while also covering those in between, striving to do a good job in nurturing the good books and weeding out the bad. "Reading" bi-monthly has sections such as "Everyone Talks About Books," "Publishing News," "New Book Reviews," and "Book Review Collections."

    “读书”半月刊出版
    “读书”半月刊是由“读书月报”改成的，创刊号已经出版。今后的“读书”半月刊主要刊登书籍评介，采取抓两头带中间的办法，努力做好书籍的浇花锄草工作。“读书”半月刊有“大家来谈书”、“出版新闻”、“新书述评”和“书评集锦”等栏目。
