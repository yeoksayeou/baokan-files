Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th: The Yueshan Agricultural Cooperative in Ningxiang County and the Jiebu Agricultural Cooperative in Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province, have overcome "single-minded" thinking and comprehensively and rationally arranged labor. They have organized specialized teams to develop diversified operations. Under the situation of a great leap forward in agricultural production, sideline production is also very active.

Both cooperatives are located in the hilly areas of central Hunan, with many avenues for agricultural and sideline production. Many people in the Yueshan Cooperative of Ningxiang County originally had insufficient understanding of the new situation of a comprehensive great leap forward this year. Some believed that it was difficult to catch two fish with both hands, and as long as there was a great leap forward in grain production, other sideline industries could be done or not. After the Party branch of the cooperative and the work team discovered these situations, they immediately organized the members to launch a great debate on whether or not to have a comprehensive leap forward, overcoming the "single-minded" thinking of cadres and the masses. Then, they properly arranged labor, adopted the method of "grouping and division of labor, specializing in specific industries, fixing tasks, and contracting all year round," and organized specialized groups for breeding, processing, and economic crops. In addition to grain production, they planned to develop more than 120 kinds of sideline production, and 65 kinds have already been started. At present, the tea gardens and hemp gardens in the cooperative are all green, the pigs and sheep are full of pens, the chickens and ducks are in flocks, and there is a prosperous scene everywhere.

The Jiebu Cooperative of Shuangfeng County also tapped the potential of labor, improved work efficiency, and organized more than 100 experienced people to form specialized sideline teams under the premise of doing a good job in grain production. They were divided into thirteen specialized groups, such as papermaking, transportation, and lime burning, according to their respective specialties, and operated more than 30 kinds of sideline production. In the past three months, they have received more than 10,000 yuan in cash. The money was not only used to buy back production materials to support agricultural production but also solved the problem of pocket money for the members.

Recently, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions requiring all agricultural cooperatives to organize specialized teams or specialized groups to carry out sideline production in accordance with local conditions.

This newspaper reports that the Xiawan Agricultural Cooperative in Wannian County, Jiangxi Province, pays attention to the leadership and arrangement of sideline production while making a great leap forward in agricultural production. The entire cooperative not only did spring plowing quickly and well, but also made great progress in sideline industries. According to the statistics of the past two months, the income from sideline industries has reached more than 900 yuan, an increase of more than two times compared with the same period last year.

Now, the sideline income of this cooperative, in addition to solving the shortage of agricultural production funds, has also completely solved the problem of the members' pocket money. The members praised: A great leap forward in agriculture, sideline industries closely follow up, sufficient production funds, life is not in a hurry, and we are more motivated to work.

    统一照顾　全面安排
    农副业生产一片兴旺
    据新华社长沙10日电　湖南省宁乡县月山农业社和双峰县街埠农业社克服“单打一”思想，全面合理安排劳动力，组织专业队开展多种经营，在农业生产大跃进的情况下，副业生产也搞的很活跃。
    这两个社都在湖南中部的丘陵山区，农副业生产门路多。宁乡县月山社原来有许多人对今年要全面大跃进的新形势认识不足，有的认为双手难捉两条鱼，只要粮食生产来个大跃进就行了，别的副业可搞可不搞。社的党支部和办社工作组发现这些情况后，就立即组织社员展开要不要全面跃进的大辩论，克服了干部和群众中的“单打一”思想。接着，就妥善安排劳力，采取“分组分工、专行专业、固定任务、常年包干”的办法，组织了饲养、加工、经济作物等专业小组，除粮食生产外，计划开展一百二十多种副业生产，现在有六十五种已经搞起来了。目前，社里的茶园、麻园一片新绿，猪羊满栏，鸡鸭成群，到处是一片兴旺景象。
    双峰县街埠社也在挖掘劳力潜力、提高工效和搞好粮食生产的前提下，抽出一百多个有经验的人组织副业专业队伍，按各人特长分成造纸、运输、烧石灰等十三个专业小组，经营三十多种副业生产。近三个月来，共收入现金一万多元。用这些钱不但买回生产资料支援了农业生产，也解决了社员零花钱的问题。
    最近，中共湖南省委已发出指示，要求各农业社因地制宜地组织专业队或专业组开展副业生产。
    本报讯　江西省万年县下湾农业社在农业生产大跃进的同时，注意对副业生产的领导和安排。全社不仅春耕生产做得又快又好，副业也有了很大发展，据最近两个月的统计，副业收入共达九百多元，比去年同期增加两倍以上。
    现在，这个社的副业收入，除解决了农业生产资金的不足以外，社员零用钱的问题也全部得到了解决。社员们称赞说：农业大跃进，副业紧跟上，生产资金足，生活不着忙，干起活来劲头更加强。
