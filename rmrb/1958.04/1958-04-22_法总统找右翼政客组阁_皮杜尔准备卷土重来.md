Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 21st: French President Coty requested Georges Bidault, a member of the Popular Republican Movement who previously served as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, to form a new government on the 20th. This is the first time the French President has designated a candidate for forming a cabinet in the five days since the Gaillard government collapsed. Bidault has agreed to attempt to form a government.

Bidault is a figure known for following the United States and adhering to the "Atlantic policy." On the North African issue, he has consistently advocated that France pursue a "tough" colonial policy. When leaving the presidential palace on the evening of the 20th, he told reporters that his policy was based on "resolutely maintaining France's hold on Algeria." He said, "The Algerian issue must be placed above all other issues. Any idea of giving up (Algeria) is intolerable." He also hopes that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries will support France's Algerian policy.

    法总统找右翼政客组阁
    皮杜尔准备卷土重来
    据新华社21日讯　巴黎消息：法国总统戈蒂20日要求人民共和党人，以前担任过总理和外交部长职务的皮杜尔组织新政府。这是盖伊阿政府垮台后五天以来法国总统第一次指定组阁人选。皮杜尔已经答应进行组阁尝试。
    皮杜尔是一个以追随美国、坚持“大西洋政策”著称的人物，在北非问题上，他一向主张法国奉行“强硬”的殖民政策。他在20日晚离开总统府的时候对记者发表谈话说，他的政策是以“坚决使法国保有阿尔及利亚”为基础的。他说，“阿尔及利亚问题必须摆在一切其他问题之上。任何放弃（阿尔及利亚）的想法都是不能容忍的。”他还希望北大西洋集团国家支持法国的阿尔及利亚政策。
