    Break Superstition, Emancipate the Mind
    Our Commentator

    In-depth rectification's thematic debates have already begun in most units. This thematic debate is very important. If the debate goes well, it can promote greater leaps forward in thought, production, and various tasks on the foundation of the great contending and great blooming of the past year.

    How do we know if a debate is good? Judging from the current situation, there are two different approaches. One is to first grasp thought and politics, and then talk about leap forward planning targets. This is from "abstract" to "concrete." The recent four-level cadre meeting of the Ministry of Coal Industry was like this. First, it spent more time, on the basis of great contending and great blooming, concentrating fire on criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking from top to bottom and neglecting political tendencies, and then it talked about the leap forward in production and work. The requirements of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry for thematic debates are: "Everyone talks about thought, everyone talks about politics." Every unit must find out whether the bourgeois ideology or the proletarian ideology is in command in their business work, whether it is empiricism, dogmatism, or Marxism-Leninism? And the main manifestations of erroneous thinking in the implementation and formulation of policies... They are now concentrating their efforts on criticizing conservative thinking and dogmatic thinking, as well as the "fading" thinking of old cadres who are professionally competent but not politically sound. The other approach is exactly the opposite. In the thematic debate, only "pragmatism" is emphasized, not "idealism." That is, only business is discussed, not politics and thought. The thematic debate of the Second Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building is like this. The "outline" that the bureau's leadership threw out for everyone to discuss were all specific issues in business. The debate was also ad hoc, focusing more on technical and business issues and less on political and ideological issues. There are still not a few units that organize debates like this.

    Which approach is better and which approach is worth promoting? To answer this question, we must first clarify what our requirements for the debate are. We believe that the requirement for the debate should be: break down the old and establish the new, and truly solve ideological problems. Only on the basis of great emancipation of the mind can the leap forward in production and work be endless. Conversely, if the ropes that bind our minds have not been completely untied and the commander has not returned to its position, those ropes will re-bind us as soon as we encounter problems on the way to the leap forward. "Rectification," as the name suggests, is to rectify the style of thinking. If, at the final and most important stage of rectification, we only talk about business but not about the style of thinking, then such a debate meeting is not a rectification meeting but only a general work meeting. It can even be said that it is not as good as a good work meeting, because a good work meeting should also talk about ideas and politics, so that political thought can command business. Therefore, we feel that the former approach should be promoted. Units that have already been "pragmatic" should add this lesson to allow the commander to truly return to its position and the soul to truly be attached to the body.

    Units that have adopted the latter approach may not agree with this statement. Some people say that it is possible to establish without breaking down the old. The ability to set advanced leap forward targets proves that conservative thinking has been broken and advanced thinking has been established. This statement is not entirely correct. On ideological issues, it is impossible to establish without breaking down the old. When a person's mind is filled with various superstitious ideas, he cannot creatively and independently think about problems. He does not even have the courage to think or say things that others or himself have not done. It is true that some units have indeed set advanced leap forward targets, but this does not mean that it is possible to establish without breaking down the old. On the contrary, the emergence of advanced targets is the result of the impact of the previous stage on conservative thinking. Moreover, having advanced targets does not mean that conservative thinking has been completely defeated and that advanced thinking has taken root firmly. Some units have encountered the resistance of conservative thinking when they discussed measures to achieve their targets after setting advanced targets. This is precisely because the old has not been thoroughly broken and the new has not taken root in everyone's minds. Focusing only on business and not on politics will cause business work to lose its soul and lose its direction. This was originally a major lesson learned in this rectification movement. However, some units have repeated this mistake in this great debate. Doesn't this also prove that what has not been thoroughly broken cannot be firmly established? Many facts have proven that when this kind of thinking has dominated us for a long time, it is not easy to break it down. When the Ministry of Coal Industry criticized right-leaning conservative thinking at this four-level cadre meeting, it encountered many specious arguments from conservatives. Only when everyone refuted them one by one did many comrades completely liberate themselves from the shackles of conservatism. If we think that breaking down the old is very easy, it is likely that we will not break it down thoroughly. If the old ideas are not broken down thoroughly, it will be difficult to consolidate the new ideas even if they are reluctantly established.

    Some comrades also feel that they should be "idealistic," but they just cannot be "idealistic." They talk about "pragmatism" with relish and in a systematic way; when they talk about "idealism," they are completely clueless. When the leadership of the four-level cadre meeting of the Ministry of Coal Industry asked everyone to talk about "idealism" and not "pragmatism" during the general meeting, this stumped many comrades. Some people were covered in sweat but still could not talk about "idealism." This situation is worthy of our vigilance. Among these comrades, there are many who were originally engaged in political and ideological work, but after taking on the leadership of economic construction, they can only talk about business and not about politics! If this situation cannot be completely reversed in this rectification movement, these comrades are in danger of becoming pragmatic people who have lost their direction. To reverse this phenomenon, in fact, talking about politics and thought is not that difficult. The problem is whether to talk about it or not. If you talk about it, you will care about politics and care about thought. If you care about politics and thought, you will definitely have politics and thought to talk about. Aren't the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry good examples?

    破除迷信，解放思想
    本报评论员
    深入整改的专题辩论在大多数单位已经开始。这个专题辩论很重要，辩论得好，就可以在一年来大鸣大放的基础上，促使思想、生产和各种工作有更大的跃进。
    怎样才算辩论得好呢？就目前的情况看，有这样两种不同的作法。一种是首先抓思想抓政治，然后再谈跃进的规划指标，这就是由“虚”到“实”。煤炭工业部最近召开的四级干部会议就是这样，首先用较多的时间在大鸣大放的基础上集中火力批判了从上到下的右倾保守思想以及忽视政治倾向等，然后再谈生产和工作上的跃进问题。冶金工业部对专题辩论的要求是：“人人谈思想，个个谈政治”，每一个单位都要找出在自己的业务工作中作统帅的究竟是资产阶级思想还是无产阶级思想，是经验主义、教条主义还是马克思列宁主义？以及主要的错误思想在执行和制定方针政策中的表现……。现在他们正集中力量批判保守思想和教条主义思想，以及老干部专而不红的“褪色”思想。另一种则恰恰相反，在专题辩论中只“务实”不“务虚”，这就是只谈业务不谈政治、思想。第一机械工业部第二局的专题辩论就是这样。这个局领导上抛出要大家讨论的“纲”，都是业务中的具体问题，辩论也是就事论事，接触技术性业务性问题多，而涉及政治思想问题的少。像这样组织辩论的单位目前还不是少数。
    究竟那种作法好、那种作法值得提倡呢？要回答这个问题，首先得弄清楚我们对辩论的要求是什么？我们认为对辩论的要求应该是：有破有立，真正解决思想问题。只有在思想大解放的基础上，生产和工作的跃进才能是无止境的。相反地，如果束缚我们思想的绳索还没有彻底解开，统帅还没有归位，跃进途中一遇问题，那些绳索便会重新把我们束缚起来。“整风”，顾名思义，就是整顿思想作风，如果到整风的最后的也是最重要的阶段，我们只谈业务，而不谈思想作风，这样的辩论会就不是整风的会议而只是一般的工作会议。甚至可以说，连好的工作会议也不如，因为好的工作会议也应该谈思想谈政治，让政治思想来统率业务。因此，我们觉得，应该提倡的是前一种作法，已经务了“实”的单位，最好再补补这一课，让统帅真正归位，灵魂真正附着在躯壳上。
    采取后一种作法的单位可能不大同意这种说法。有人说，不破也可以立，能够定出先进的跃进指标来，就证明已经破了保守思想立了先进思想。这种说法是不完全正确的。在思想问题上，不破就不可能立。当一个人的脑子里还充塞着各种迷信观念的时候，他就不可能创造性地独立思考问题，别人或自己所没有做过的事情甚至连想一想说一说的胆量也都没有。不错，有些单位的确已经定出了先进的跃进指标，但是，这并不能说明不破就可以立，恰恰相反，先进指标的出现，正是前一阶段对保守思想冲击的结果。而且，有了先进指标并不能说保守思想就已经完全被打垮，先进思想已经很牢固地扎下根子。有些单位在订出了先进的指标接着讨论实现指标的措施的时候，就又遇到了保守思想的抗拒，这正是因为对保守思想破得还不彻底，先进思想还没有在大家脑子里扎根的缘故。只管业务不问政治将会使业务工作失去灵魂迷失方向，这本来是这次整风运动中已经得出的一个重大教训，可是，这次大辩论中，有些单位竟然又重犯这个毛病，这不同样证明破得不彻底，就立得不巩固吗？许多事实证明：当这种思想已经统治了我们很久后，破起来不是很容易的。煤炭部在这次四级干部会议上批判右倾保守思想的时候，就曾经碰到了保守主义者的许许多多似是而非的论据，只有当大家一个又一个的驳倒了它们的时候，很多同志才从保守主义的束缚中彻底解放出来。如果把破看得很容易，就很可能破不彻底；旧思想破得不彻底，新思想即使勉强立起来也是很难巩固的。
    也有些同志觉得应该“务虚”，可就是“虚不起来”，谈起“实”来津津有味头头是道；谈起“虚”来就是丈二和尚摸不着头脑。煤炭部四级干部会议大会发言的时候，领导方面要求大家谈“虚”不谈“实”，这一下，就难住了不少同志，有些人蹩得满身大汗还是谈不出“虚”来。这种情况是值得引起我们警惕的。在这些同志中有不少原来是搞政治思想工作的，但在担负了经济建设的领导工作以后，竟然只会谈业务不会谈政治了！如果在这次整风运动中不能彻底扭转这种情况，这些同志就有变成迷失方向的实际家的危险。要扭转这种现象，其实，谈政治谈思想并不是那么困难的，问题在于谈不谈，谈，就会关心政治关心思想，关心了政治和思想也就一定有政治思想可谈。煤炭工业部、冶金工业部不就是很好的例子吗？
