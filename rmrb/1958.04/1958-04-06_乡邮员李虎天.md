    Rural Postman Li Hutian
    By Our Correspondent Ye Jianyun
   (Continued from yesterday)
    A person who is good at making progress often puts forward many assumptions in front of himself. Li Hutian realized this assumption and then put forward a new assumption.
    "Can all undeliverable letters be made to have a destination?"
    This assumption was made in the winter before last year. In early winter, two letters were sent from the Soviet Union one after another. One letter was addressed to He Yiquan, and the other to Jin Changyan. The addresses of these two letters were correct, but after turning over the household registration books of more than 2,500 households in the entire district, they could not be found. Later, he also invited the directors of the various agricultural production cooperatives to help make public announcements at the general meetings of all members. More than half a month passed, and there was still no result.
    He was criticized by the director for this matter. The thing is like this. Relying on his youth and strength, he couldn't find it, so he adopted the method of running around and asking questions diligently. He thought that as long as he ran a few more miles and asked a few more people, he didn't believe he couldn't find them. The villages here are very sparse, and there are mountains and depressions between the villages. In order to try to run to a few more villages, he often took shortcuts across the thin ice in the depressions. At this time, although the weather was cold, the ice on the water surface was not yet frozen solid. If he was not careful, he would fall into the river. When the north wind blew, his soaked cotton trousers froze like popsicles. Over time, his legs cracked. When he went to bed at night, the wounds were burning hot.
    This day, the director had just returned from a meeting outside. As soon as he walked into the dormitory, he noticed that Xiao Li was talking in his sleep. He screamed in pain for a while. The director gently woke him up and asked him where it hurt. Xiao Li vaguely replied that his legs hurt. The director lifted the quilt and took a look. Oh my god, these legs were like tree bark. The fresh blood flowing out of the cracks had already formed scabs.
    "What's going on? If you turn these legs into this, do you still want to go to work tomorrow?"
    At this time, Li Hutian was completely awake. He protected his legs with his hands and hurriedly covered up, saying:
    "This is a problem I've had since I was born; it's okay, it'll be fine after a night's sleep."
    The director was an experienced person. At a glance at the injury, he knew that it was frostbite. Moreover, the wet cotton trousers were steaming near the stove.
    "Young man, we are working, not risking our lives. In such cold weather, you are still wading in the water." Speaking of this, the director paused. He looked at Li Hutian's vigorous face and immediately changed his tone and said, "Comrade, you are a member of the Communist Youth League. Can a person who doesn't cherish his body be considered a good member?"
    Li Hutian felt unspeakable grievance after being scolded by the director. Seeing that the director was sitting on the opposite bunk, he mustered up the courage to give a detailed report of his plan. He also said that if these two letters from the Soviet Union were not delivered, the branch office would be disgraced, and the Chinese postal workers would also be disgraced.
    "Yes, your plan is good. But you also have to pay attention to your working methods. Take these two letters as an example. If you ask a few older people..." Before the director could finish speaking, Xiao Li jumped up from the bunk.
    "That's right, I never thought of doing it this way before."
    He hurriedly put on his clothes and got out of bed, and collected all the undeliverable letters overnight, and copied a list of the recipients' names and the sender's address, and hid it in his jacket pocket.
    The next day when he went to work, he read these names to the old people every time he went to a village. In a few days, a batch of missing letters were delivered. However, no one knew about the two letters from the Soviet Union.
    One evening, Li Hutian returned from work in Huajian Township and passed by Dexin Village, when he was met by an old man in his eighties. Xiao Li was very surprised when he saw him. All the old people in this village had been visited, but this was the first time he had met this old man. He asked and learned that his name was Longyan, the oldest man in the district, and he had recently come home from visiting relatives. After a few words, Xiao Li told him about the letters from the Soviet Union. The old man thought for a long time and replied that he did not remember these two people, but old people have bad memories and can continue to think about it.
    More than ten days later, one evening, an old man came to the post office and claimed to be looking for rural postman Li Hutian. Xiao Li went out and saw that it was the old man Longyan. He asked him to sit down in the house. The old man said:
    "I remember the one you are looking for whose surname is Jin. This person has been dead for thirty-one years, but his old wife is still there; her surname is He, maybe someone in her family whose maternal side is named He Yiquan. This family has a son who went out to make a living the year before Jin Changyan died. Could these two letters be their family letters?"
    Xiao Li sent the old man away, took a flashlight, took the two letters, and rushed to this house overnight to deliver them. When this old woman, who had been separated from her son for more than 30 years, read her son's letter, she immediately knelt down in front of Xiao Li. She said:
    "Thank the Communist Party for cultivating such a good person like you."
    Speaking of this, Li Hutian repeatedly said that the work of a rural postman can serve the people in every way. In order to confirm his point of view, he told another experience.
    One snowy morning in January 1957, Xiao Li carried his mailbag to Nanyang Township for work. It was a snowy and windy day, and it was very cold. There were very few pedestrians on the road. After walking less than seven or eight miles, he was met by a woman of about forty years old. She had a white towel tied on her head, and she was holding a crutch in her hand. She took a step and hummed, her face pale. When the two met, Xiao Li walked past very normally. After walking not far, he suddenly thought that the older sister who had just passed by must be sick. If she continues to rush like this, she may be in danger somewhere. So, he hurriedly turned around and caught up with the woman. After asking, he learned that this woman was originally a parturient, and her husband worked in another place and had sent fifteen yuan from the post office a few days ago. Now she was in urgent need of money and was rushing to the post office to cash the remittance.
    At that time, Li Hutian sent the parturient home, took fifteen yuan from the mailbag and gave it to her; and said that he was a staff member of the post office, and he could handle all the procedures on his behalf when he returned to the office.
    After he walked out of the parturient's house, he felt very uneasy. Because he didn't bring any money with him on this business trip, but embezzled the public funds of the Nanyang Township People's Committee to pay for it. Embezzling public funds is a violation of the system. However, he also thought: as long as he helps others in need, it doesn't matter even if he is criticized or punished. Unexpectedly, when he told the leading comrades about this matter, not only was he not criticized, but on the contrary, the leadership praised him for doing the right thing and doing it well.
    In the eyes of some people, the work of a rural postman is just running errands, taking and sending things. In fact, how can the work of a rural postman be so simple?
    "A rural postman must not only run diligently and quickly, but more importantly, do a good job in investigation." This is a valuable experience that Li Hutian has accumulated in his work over the past few years.
    At present, he has done the following in the more than 70 villages he often runs to: he knows almost everything about who lives in the east end of the village, what the surname of the family in the west end is, and who is next to whom. Before leaving for work, all the mail is arranged in the order of delivery, and it is distributed one by one as soon as it arrives. In this way, the delivery speed has almost doubled. Not only that, in order to do a good job in newspaper promotion and distribution, he has an account in his mind of how many middle school students, elementary school students, how many people can read Chinese, how many people can read Korean, and what the economic situation of these people is in each village. In the past five years, he has organized 50 reading groups under the leadership of the local party organization, which were established on the basis of investigation and understanding. According to his analysis, it is completely certain that this year the entire region will achieve an average of one newspaper for every nine people.
    Finally, when I finished this interview, Li Hutian put forward a new assumption. He said:
    "In the past few years, I often have to travel at night, which is nothing to a young man. However, is it possible to think of more ways to improve the working conditions during tense labor?"
    Then he answered this question himself:
    "I love my current job the most. It should be said that it is no problem for a person to make his beloved work more beautiful and more ideal." (Attached picture)

### 乡邮员李虎天

    乡邮员李虎天
    本报记者　叶剑韵
   （接昨）
    一个善于进取的人，在自己的面前，经常会提出许许多多的假设。李虎天实现了这个假设，接着又提出了一个新的假设。
    “能不能让一切无法投递的信件，都有着落呢？”
    提出这个假设是前年冬天的事情。初冬，接连从苏联寄来了两封信。一封信的收件人是何一权，另一封寄给金昌彦。这两封信的地址没有错，可是把全区两千五百多户的户籍簿全翻遍了，就是找不着。后来他又约请各个农业生产合作社的主任，在开全体社员大会时帮助作公开的通知。时间又过去了半个多月，仍旧毫无着落。
    为了这件事，他还挨了局长一顿批评。事情是这样的。他仗着自己年青力壮，找不着，就采取勤跑勤问的办法。他想，只要多跑几里地多问几个人，不信就找不着。这一带村子很稀，村与村之间除了山岭就是甸子。为了争取多跑几个村子，他常常踏着甸子里的薄冰抄近赶路。这时，天气虽然冷，水面的冰还冻得不结实。一不小心，就掉下河去了。北风一吹，湿透了的棉裤冻得像冰棒一样。日久，两条腿冻裂了。晚上一睡下来，创口痛得火辣辣的。
    这天，局长刚从外边开会回来，一走进宿舍，就发觉小李在说梦话。说一阵就尖声叫痛起来。局长轻轻地把他叫醒，问他什么地方痛，小李迷迷糊糊地回说腿痛。局长掀开被一看，天哪，这双腿就像树皮一样。那些裂口子的地方，流出来的鲜血已经结成了疤。
    “这是怎么搞的。你把这双腿搞成这个样子，明天还想出班不？”
    这时李虎天完全醒了，用手护着腿，急忙掩盖说：
    “这是生下来就有的毛病；没关系，睡一夜就好了。”
    局长是一个有经验的人，一看伤势，就知道这是冻坏了的。而且就近的火炉子上，那件湿透了的棉裤，正烤得水汽腾腾。
    “青年人，咱们是工作，可不是拼命。这么冷的天气，你还淌水。”说到这里，局长停了停。他瞧着李虎天那副朝气勃勃的面孔，马上就改口说，“同志，你是共青团员，难道一个不爱惜身体的人，可以算是一个好团员吗！”
    李虎天受了局长一顿数说，心里有说不出的委屈。他见局长在对面铺上坐下了，于是就鼓足勇气把自己的打算做了详细的汇报。并说，这两封来自苏联的信，如果不设法送到的话，支局不光彩，中国邮电工人也不光彩。
    “是的，你的打算是好的。可是你的工作方法也得讲究一些。就拿这两封信来说，如果多找几个年长的老人……”没等局长的话说完，小李从铺上蹦了起来。
    “这可说对了，过去，我从来也没有想到这么办过。”
    他急忙披衣起床，连夜把那些无法投递的信件收集拢来，将收件人的姓名和发信的地址抄了一张清单，藏在上衣的口袋里。
    第二天出班，每到一村，就把这些名字念给老人们听。不几天，一批下落不明的信件投递出去了。然而，从苏联来的这两封信，问谁谁也说不知道。
    一天傍晚，李虎天从铧尖乡出班回来，路过德新村，迎面来了个八十多岁的老汉。小李一见很奇怪，这个村上所有的老人都访问过了，唯独这个老汉是第一次见面。一问，才知道他叫龙岩，是全区年纪最大的老人，最近走亲戚才来家。谈不几句，小李就把苏联来信的事告诉了他。老汉思索了好久回说，记不起有这两个人了，不过，上年纪的人，记性坏，可以再继续想想。
    十多天以后的一个傍晚，邮局门前来了一个老汉，声称要找乡邮员李虎天。小李出门一看，原来就是龙岩老人。他让他到屋子里坐下。老人说：
    “你要找的那个姓金的我可想起来了。这人已经死了三十一年，不过他老伴还在；她姓何，或许她娘家的什么人叫何一权。这家有个儿子，在金昌彦死去的前一年就外出谋生了。这两封信是不是他们的家信呢？”
    小李送走了老人，拿了个手电筒，捎上那两封信，连夜赶到这家去投递。当这个和儿子失散了三十多年的老大娘读了儿子的来信以后，立即跪倒在小李的面前。她说：
    “感谢共产党，培养了像你这样的好人。”
    说到这里，李虎天反复地说，乡邮员的工作，在在都可以为人民服务。为了证实他的观点，他又说了一段经历。
    1957年1月间一个下雪天的早晨。小李背上邮包出班到南阳乡去。那天雪大风大，天气很冷，路上行人很少。走了不到七、八里地，迎面来了一个四十岁左右的妇女。她头上扎了一条白毛巾，手里扶着一根拐棍，走一步，哼一哼，脸色苍白。当两人相遇的时候，小李很平常地走过去了。走不多远，心里突然想起，刚过去的这位大嫂一定有病。像这样赶下去，说不定会在什么地方出危险。于是，他急忙掉过头来赶上了那个妇女。一询问，才知道这个女人原来是个产妇，丈夫在外地工作，几天前从邮局寄来了十五元钱。现在她急等钱用，正赶到邮局去兑取汇款。
    当时李虎天一面把这个产妇送回家去，一面从邮包里取出十五元钱来交给她；并说自己就是邮局里的工作人员，一切手续可以由他回局代办。
    他走出这个产妇的家门以后，心里十分不安。因为这一天出差，自己身上并没有带钱，而是挪用南阳乡人民委员会的公款垫付的。挪用公款是违反制度的。但是，他又想：只要救了别人的急，即使自己受批评受处分也算不了什么。事出意外，当他把这件事告诉了领导同志以后，不仅没有受到批评，相反的领导上却表扬他做得对，做得好。
    在某些人看来，一个乡邮员的工作，就是跑跑路，拿拿送送。其实，乡邮员的工作何尝是这么简单哩。
    “一个乡邮员，不仅要勤跑快跑，更重要的是做好调查工作。”这是李虎天几年来在工作中积累下来的一条宝贵经验。
    目前，他常跑的七十多个村子，已经做到：村东头住的那一家，西头那家姓什么，谁家和谁家是紧邻，差不多全记熟了。出班以前，所有邮件依照投递先后编成顺序，一到就挨次分发。这样，投递的速度差不多提高了一倍。不仅如此，他为了做好报刊推广发行工作，对哪个村子有多少中学生、小学生，多少人能读汉文，多少人能读朝鲜文，这些人的经济情况怎么样，肚子里已经有了一本账。五年来，他在地方党组织的领导下组织了五十个读报组，就是在调查了解的基础上搞起来的。根据他的分析，今年全区做到平均每九个人一份报刊，完全有把握。
    最后，在我结束这次访问的时候，李虎天又提出了一个新的假设。他说：
    “几年来，经常要夜间赶路，这对一个青年人来说，算不了什么。可是，在紧张的劳动中，再多想一些办法，来改善一下劳动条件，有没有可能呢？”
    接着他自己又回答了这个问题：
    “我最爱我现在的岗位。一个人，使自己心爱的工作更美好、更理想，应该说这是不成问题的。”（附图片）
