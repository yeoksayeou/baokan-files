    Agricultural Cooperativization Movement in Eastern European Countries
    Liu Jing
    With the vigorous development of socialist industrialization in the Eastern European people's democratic countries, the socialist transformation of agriculture also reached a climax in 1956 and 1957. So far, the number of agricultural cooperative organizations and the area of cultivated land occupied by the seven Eastern European people's democratic countries are as follows:
  		Number of Agricultural Production Cooperatives  Percentage of Land in Cooperatives to Total National Cultivated Land
	Czechoslovakia	11476		　	  62%
	Hungary　	3465			　11.6%
	Romania	14000			　52.4%※
	Bulgaria	3200　			  86.5%
	Albania	1698　			  58.1%
	German Democratic Republic	6691　			  25.2%
	Poland		1926△　		  ××
	(※ This percentage includes land owned by Romanian state farms.)
	(△ In addition to agricultural production cooperatives, Poland also has more than 10,000 agricultural groups with 310,000 members.)
    It can be seen from the above table that although the proportion of the socialist economy in the agriculture of Eastern European countries varies, it is in a dominant position in most countries. Only Hungary, due to the counter-revolutionary rebellion in October 1956, dissolved more than half of its original four thousand agricultural cooperatives, so its proportion is temporarily smaller.

    Characteristics of the Cooperativization Movement
    What are the characteristics of the agricultural cooperativization movement in Eastern European countries in the past two years? First of all, the agricultural cooperativization movement has developed very rapidly, with Albania having the fastest development, followed by Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. Although the cooperativization movements in Hungary and Poland declined for a time in 1956, the pace is still not slow judging from the number of cooperatives that have been restored.

    In 1957, Albania established almost as many new agricultural cooperatives as it had established in the previous ten years combined. Czechoslovakia established more than three thousand unified agricultural cooperatives in 1957 alone. The number of agricultural cooperatives in Bulgaria has increased from 2,735 at the end of 1955 to more than 3,200 currently, an increase of nearly 1,000. The land area of agricultural cooperatives in Romania has more than doubled in the past two years, and the number of cooperatives has more than doubled.

    The second characteristic of the agricultural cooperativization movement in Eastern European countries is that along with the development of advanced forms of agricultural cooperatives, a large number of lower-level cooperative organizations have also emerged. For example, a large number of mutual aid groups and specialized production groups have emerged in the rural areas of Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic. The large-scale emergence of lower-level forms of agricultural cooperation shows that the vast number of farmers have realized the necessity and benefits of organizing, and that the cooperativization movement has taken a big step forward. Because these scattered individual farmers first cooperate in certain aspects, they can gradually become accustomed to the form of collective farming, providing favorable conditions both ideologically and organizationally for the transition to advanced socialist cooperatives.

    The third characteristic is that middle peasants have begun to participate in agricultural cooperatives. For example, in Czechoslovakia, middle peasants accounted for the majority of farmers who joined cooperatives in 1957. In other people's democratic countries, the number of middle peasants participating in agricultural cooperatives has also begun to increase in the past two years.

    Reasons for the Rapid Development of the Cooperativization Movement
    The rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in Eastern European countries in the past two years is primarily due to the strengthening of political and ideological education and material assistance to farmers by the parties and governments of Eastern European countries. In the past two years, the parties and governments of Eastern European countries have mobilized cadres at all levels to strengthen political, organizational, and propaganda work among farmers, help train cadres for cooperatives, and send cadres to strengthen the leadership of cooperatives. A large number of organized visits, competitions, and symposiums have been very effective, enabling the vast number of farmers to recognize the superiority of cooperativization. At the same time, the governments of these countries have expanded loans to cooperatives. For example, in 1956, the Albanian government's loans to agricultural cooperatives increased by 86% compared to 1955, and long-term loans obtained by cooperatives increased by 32.3 times compared to 1955. In 1957, the total amount of agricultural loans received by agricultural cooperatives in the German Democratic Republic from the state reached 130 million marks. In addition, Eastern European countries have strengthened the work of machine tractor stations, which has also provided great assistance to farmers. In the German Democratic Republic, machine tractor stations completed more than 80% of the field work for agricultural production cooperatives, and Albania has 33 machine tractor stations that regularly provide field work services for cooperatives.

    Secondly, preferential treatment in tax policies and purchase prices of agricultural products, and the reduction of compulsory sales quotas by the parties and governments of various countries have all promoted the development of cooperatives.

    In addition, the continuous increase in production of agricultural cooperatives has also stimulated the rapid development of cooperatives in terms of organization. The increased production of agricultural cooperatives has enabled individual farmers to recognize the superiority of agricultural cooperativization. For example, in Czechoslovakia, from 1953 to 1956, the unit area yield of cooperatives increased by 15%, while the land of individual farmers only increased by 5%. In 1956, cooperatives had an income of 2,470 crowns per hectare of land, while individual farmers only had 1,932 crowns. In Hungary, the grain unit area yield of cooperatives in 1957 was generally 30% higher than that of individual farmers, and the income of about one-third of the agricultural production cooperatives had caught up with or exceeded the level of ordinary middle peasants.

    Significance of the Vigorous Development of the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement
    The rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the Eastern European people's democratic countries has a very important significance for the prosperity of the national economies and the progress of socialist construction in various countries. Before liberation, most Eastern European countries, with the exception of a few, were agricultural countries. After liberation, socialist industry developed vigorously, but the development of agriculture lagged behind, and the countryside could not supply sufficient grain and raw materials to industrial cities. In order to increase agricultural production, prosper the economy, further resolve the contradiction between socialist large-scale industry and small-peasant economy, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and promote the progress of the entire socialist economic construction, the socialist transformation of agriculture is essential. In the past two years, the parties and governments of Eastern European countries have given deep concern to the agricultural cooperative movement, and regard the socialist transformation of agriculture as one of the most important tasks at present. At present, the various people's democratic countries are making long-term plans on the basis of the great achievements already made in the agricultural cooperativization movement, and will more rapidly and extensively push the agricultural cooperativization movement forward. For example, Albania expects that in 1960, 78% of the total agricultural output will come from socialist components, and Romania strives to have 60% to 70% of the total commodity grain come from socialist components of agriculture in 1960.

    The Eastern European people's democratic countries won a great victory on the socialist transformation front of agriculture in 1956 and 1957, which also marks that the Eastern European people's democratic countries have taken another big step forward in the entire socialist construction.

    东欧各国的农业合作化运动
    刘竞
    随着东欧各人民民主国家社会主义工业化的蓬勃发展，在1956年和1957年，农业社会主义改造也出现了高潮。到目前为止，东欧七个人民民主国家拥有的农业合作组织的数目和所占的耕地面积如下：
  		农业生产合作组织数目  合作组织的土地占				      全国耕地的百分比捷克斯洛伐克　	11476		　	  62％匈牙利　	3465			　11.6％罗马尼亚	14000			　52.4％※保加利亚　	3200　			  86.5％阿尔巴尼亚　	1698　			  58.1％德意志民主共和国6691　			  25.2％波兰　		1926△　		  ××（※这个百分比包括罗马尼亚国营农场拥有的土地。）（△波兰除农业生产合作社外，还拥有农业小组一万多个，有组员三十一万人。）
    从上表可以看出社会主义经济在东欧各国农业中所占的比重虽然各不相同，但是在多数国家里已居于优势地位。只是匈牙利由于1956年十月反革命叛乱事件，曾使原有的四千个农业合作社解散了一半以上，因此它的比重暂时比较小些。
    合作化运动的特点
    两年以来，东欧各国农业合作化运动有些什么特点呢？首先是农业合作化运动的发展非常迅速，其中以阿尔巴尼亚农业合作化运动发展得最快，其次是捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚。匈牙利和波兰的合作化运动虽在1956年曾一度下降，但从已恢复的合作社数目来看，速度也是不慢的。
    阿尔巴尼亚在1957年一年内新建的农业合作社接近于以往十年所建立的农业合作社的总数。捷克斯洛伐克在1957年这一年总共新建立了三千多个统一农业合作社。保加利亚的农业合作社已从1955年底的二千七百三十五个，增加到目前的三千二百多个，增加了近一千个。罗马尼亚全国农业合作社的土地面积两年来增加了一倍以上，合作社的数目增加了一倍多。
    东欧各国的农业合作化运动的第二个特点，就是与发展高级形式的农业合作社的同时，也出现了大量低级形式的合作组织。例如，波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、民主德国农村中都涌现了大量的互助组、专门生产小组等。较低级的农业合作形式大量出现，说明广大的农民已经认识到组织起来的必要和好处，说明了合作化运动前进了一大步。因为这些分散的个体农民先从某些方面合作起来，就可以逐渐地习惯集体耕作的形式，无论在思想上和组织上都为过渡到社会主义性质的高级社提供了有利的条件。
    第三个特点就是中农已开始参加农业合作社了。例如，在捷克斯洛伐克，1957年加入合作社的农户以中农占多数。其他各人民民主国家，中农参加农业合作社的数目，近两年来也在开始增加。合作化运动迅速发展的原因
    东欧各国农业合作化运动在最近两年来发展得这么快，首先是由于东欧各国党和政府加强了对农民的政治思想教育和物质上的援助。近两年来，东欧各国的党和政府都动员了各级干部在农民中加强了政治、组织和宣传工作，帮助培养、训练合作社的干部和派遣干部以加强合作社的领导。大量组织参观、评比和座谈会的工作收到很大效果，使广大农民认识到合作化的优越性。与此同时，这些国家的政府都扩大了对合作社的贷款，例如，1956年阿尔巴尼亚政府给农业合作社的贷款比1955年增加了86％，合作社所获得的长期贷款比1955年增加了三十二点三倍。1957年德意志民主共和国的农业合作社从国家得到的农业贷款总额达到了一亿三千万马克。此外，东欧各国加强了机器拖拉机站的工作，这对于农民也提供了巨大的帮助。在德意志民主共和国，机器拖拉机站为农业生产合作社完成了80％以上的田间工作，阿尔巴尼亚有三十三个机器拖拉机站经常为合作社田间工作服务。
    其次，是由于各国党和政府在税收政策、农产品的收购价格方面给予优惠的待遇，降低了义务交售额，这都促进了合作社的发展。
    此外，农业合作社的不断增产也刺激了合作社在组织上的迅速发展。农业合作社的增产，使个体农民认识到农业合作化的优越性。例如，在捷克斯洛伐克，从1953年到1956年的四年中，合作社的单位面积产量增加了15％，而个体农民的土地只增加了5％。1956年合作社每公顷土地收入二千四百七十克朗，个体农民只有一千九百三十二克朗。在匈牙利，1957年合作社的谷物单位面积产量一般比个体农民高30％，而且约有三分之一的农业生产合作社的收入已经赶上或超过了一般中农的水平。
    农业合作化运动蓬勃发展的意义
    东欧各人民民主国家农业合作化运动的迅速发展，对于各国国民经济的繁荣和社会主义建设的进程有着十分重要的意义。解放以前，东欧各国除个别国家外，大多是农业国。解放后，社会主义工业蓬勃地发展起来，但是，农业的发展却跟不上，农村还不能供给工业城市充足的粮食和原料。为了提高农业生产，繁荣经济，为了进一步解决社会主义大工业和小农经济之间的矛盾，巩固工农联盟，推进整个社会主义经济建设的进程，农业的社会主义改造是十分必要的。近两年来，东欧各国的党和政府对于农业合作运动给予了深切的关怀，把农业的社会主义改造看作当前最重要的任务之一。目前，各人民民主国家正在农业合作化运动已取得的巨大成绩的基础上作出了远景规划，将更迅速、更广泛地把农业合作化运动推向前进。例如，阿尔巴尼亚预计1960年在农业总产量中将有78％来自社会主义成分，罗马尼亚争取在1960年使整个商品谷物中有60％至70％来自农业的社会主义成分。
    东欧人民民主国家1956年和1957年这两年，在农业的社会主义改造战线上打了一个大胜仗，这也标志着东欧各人民民主国家在整个社会主义建设中，又迈进了一大步。
