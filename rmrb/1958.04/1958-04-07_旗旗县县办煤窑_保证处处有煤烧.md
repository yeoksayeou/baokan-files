    Every Banner and County Runs Coal Mines, Guaranteeing Coal for Everyone
    Our newspaper, Hohhot, 6th dispatch: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has decided to mobilize the entire population to run small coal mines, aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in coal for all government agencies, organizations, urban residents, and the vast rural, pastoral, and mountainous farmers and herdsmen within five years. By 1962, the Autonomous Region's coal production will increase from 1.2 million tons in 1957 to 11.2 million tons.
    To achieve this great leap forward plan, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Mining Bureau has decided to transfer more than 300 staff members of all ethnic groups from the Mining Bureau system to fully commit to building small coal mines. The first batch of twenty-eight newly built coal mines has begun preparations for construction. Once these coal mines are completed and put into production this year, they can produce 260,000 to 300,000 tons of coal. Adding the output of other coal mines, the Autonomous Region's coal production this year will reach 2.04 million tons, an increase of 70% over last year. Issues such as technical personnel, funding, and resources have also been resolved.
    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has abundant underground coal resources, with reserves of approximately 600 million tons within the scope of local industrial mining alone (excluding the state-owned Daqingshan Coalfield, Yuanbaoshan and other coal mines). In order to accelerate the speed of well construction, the Mining Bureau has not only established semi-mechanized well construction teams and sent technicians to other regions to learn design and other technologies, but also plans to train more than 400 staff members of all ethnic groups to be dispatched to various banners and counties to run small coal mines.

    旗旗县县办煤窑  保证处处有煤烧
    本报呼和浩特6日电　内蒙古自治区决定全民动手办小煤窑，五年内做到各机关、团体、城镇居民和广大农村、牧区、山区农牧民所使用的煤全部自给。到1962年，自治区的煤产量就可从1957年的一百二十万吨增加到一千一百二十万吨。
    为了实现这个跃进计划，内蒙古自治区矿务局已经决定从矿务局系统抽调三百多名各族职工全力以赴兴办小型煤窑。第一批新建的二十八个煤窑已着手筹建。这批煤窑今年建成投入生产，即可生产煤二十六万吨到三十万吨。加上其它煤窑的产量，今年自治区煤炭产量将达到二百零四万吨，比去年增长70％。技术人员，资金和资源等问题也已经获得解决。
    内蒙古自治区地下煤炭资源丰富，仅地方工业开采范围的蕴藏量约达六亿吨（国营大青山煤田、元宝山等煤矿除外）。矿务局为了加快建井速度，除已成立半机械化的建井队、派技术人员到外区学习设计等技术外，还准备训练四百多名各族职工分散到各旗县开办小型煤矿。　（师海云）
