    捷国民议会欢迎苏联倡议
    反对西德原子武装
    据新华社布拉格15日电　捷克斯洛伐克国民议会今天发表声明，支持苏联最高苏维埃关于停止试验核武器问题致世界各国议会的呼吁书。
    声明吁请美国国会和英国议会促使本国政府停止试验核武器。
    这个声明是国民议会在今天开幕的会议上通过的。
    这个会议还就西德联邦议院关于用原子武器武装西德军队的决定通过了一项声明。声明说，捷克斯洛伐克人民希望按照捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国之间所建立的和睦关系，同全德人民和平友好相处。但是，当他们看到西德的侵略势力的影响日益增强、并且由于实施用原子武器装备西德军队的计划而形成危险局势时，他们不能置之不理。
