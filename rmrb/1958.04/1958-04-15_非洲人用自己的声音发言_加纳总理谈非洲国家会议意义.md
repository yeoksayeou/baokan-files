Xinhua News Agency, Accra, April 14th: Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah said in a radio address on the 13th that the Conference of African States, scheduled to be held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, on the 15th, will be "the most significant event in African history for many centuries."

Nkrumah said: "For a long time, Africa has spoken through the voices of others. Now, it will speak through the voices of its own children."

Nkrumah also said: "We will exchange views on political, economic, social, and cultural issues of common concern to the participating countries, hoping that this will lay the foundation for future cooperation in these areas."

He said, "We will not forget our brothers in many parts of Africa who unfortunately have not yet enjoyed the freedom we have won." He said, "We will also seek to provide encouragement and hope to all those who are not yet free to control their own destiny."

According to the invitation letter signed by Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah at the end of last year, the topics for discussion at the conference will include: African affairs, particularly the foreign policies of the participating countries, the future of some African territories currently under imperialist rule, and the issue of racial discrimination.

    加纳总理谈非洲国家会议意义
    据新华社14日讯　阿克拉消息：加纳总理恩克鲁玛在13日发表的广播谈话中说，预定15日在加纳首都阿克拉举行的非洲国家会议将是“许多世纪以来非洲历史上最有意义的事件”。
    恩克鲁玛说：“很久以来非洲一直通过别人的声音发言。现在，它将通过非洲自己的子孙的声音发言了。”
    恩克鲁玛还说：“我们将就与会国共同有关的政治、经济、社会和文化问题交换意见，希望这样可为今后在这些方面的合作奠定基础。”
    他说，“我们不会忘却非洲许多地方不幸尚未享受我们所赢得的自由的兄弟们。”他说，“我们还将设法使所有还不能自由掌握自己命运的人们得到鼓励和希望。”
    据去年底由加纳总理恩克鲁玛签署的邀请书说，这次会议讨论的内容将包括：非洲事务，特别是参加会议各国的外交政策、目前在帝国主义统治下的一些非洲领土的前途问题，以及种族歧视问题等。
