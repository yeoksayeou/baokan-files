Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) today submitted a request to Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, demanding that the Kishi government break away from all relations of subservience to the United States, stand on an independent and autonomous position, and comply with the urgent wishes of the Japanese people by immediately and unconditionally agreeing to the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, so that the agreement can be fully implemented. The request stated, "We believe that the attitude taken by the Kishi government is a violation of good faith and is also extremely detrimental to the Japanese economy."

    The Sino-Japanese Trade Association held an emergency board meeting in Tokyo yesterday, attended by representatives of manufacturers from more than fifty organizations. The meeting passed a statement criticizing the Kishi government for not providing a correct answer to the issue of the three Japanese trade organizations requesting the government to agree to the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, thus hindering the implementation of the trade agreement. The statement believes that this will damage the friendly relations between Japan and China that Japanese non-governmental organizations have worked hard to establish over the years. The statement demands that the Kishi government should respect the flag of the People's Republic of China, the symbol of the 600 million Chinese people, just as China respects the Japanese flag.

    The statement demands that the Kishi government should recognize the basic spirit of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and take measures to ensure the implementation of this agreement. The Sino-Japanese Trade Association will submit the above statement to the Kishi government and the three Japanese trade organizations.

    The Sino-Japanese Trade Association also decided to appeal to the Japan International Trade Promotion Association to jointly hold a national manufacturers' conference to discuss the implementation of the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Japan Socialist Party Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma and two others met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichiro Fujiyama today. Based on the decision made by the Socialist Party's Special Committee for the Restoration of Japan-China Diplomatic Relations at its meeting yesterday, they demanded that Aiichiro Fujiyama retract his remarks made on the 9th on behalf of the Kishi government regarding the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, which were hostile to the Chinese people.

    Aiichiro Fujiyama unreasonably rejected the above-mentioned request made by the Socialist Party.

    日本工会谴责政府屈从美国
    要求实施中日贸易协定
    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会今天向日本首相岸信介递交了一份要求书，要求岸信介政府摆脱屈从美国的一切关系，站在独立自主的立场，顺从日本人民的迫切愿望，立即无条件地同意第四次中日贸易协定，使协定能够完全付诸实施。要求书说，我们认为，岸信介政府采取的这种态度是违背了信义，而且对日本经济也是非常不利的。
    中日贸易会昨天在东京举行了有五十多个单位的厂商代表参加的紧急理事会会议。会议通过一项声明，指责岸信介政府没有对日本贸易三团体要求政府同意第四次中日贸易协定问题作出正确的答复以致阻挠了贸易协定的实施。声明认为这将会破坏几年来日本民间团体努力建立起来的日中友好关系。声明要求岸信介政府应该尊重中国六亿人民的象征——中华人民共和国的国旗，正如中国尊重日本国旗一样。
    声明要求岸信介政府应该认清中日贸易协定的基本精神，采取措施保证这个协定的执行。中日贸易会将把上述声明递交给岸信介政府和日本贸易三团体。
    中日贸易会还决定，将吁请日本国际贸易促进协会共同举行全国厂商大会来讨论实施中日贸易协定的问题。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎等三人今天会见内阁官房长官爱知揆一，根据社会党恢复日中邦交特别委员会昨天举行会议所作出的决定，要求爱知揆一收回他在9日代表岸信介政府就第四次日中贸易协定问题所发表的敌视中国人民的谈话。
    爱知揆一无理地拒绝了社会党向他提出的上述要求。
