Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 24th: (Our correspondent Zhang Yang) Concern about the American economic crisis and a more pressing desire to expand East-West trade were the main sentiments at the thirteenth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, which closed here tonight.

    Twenty-eight delegations from Eastern and Western European countries and the United States attended the meeting.

    In the seventeen days of discussions, almost all participants spoke about the economic crisis. The Western representatives expressed such strong unease that the US representatives repeatedly stood up to tout America's post-war development and list the "anti-recession measures" being implemented and considered, attempting to cheer up their Western allies who were increasingly losing confidence in the US economy. But even they themselves could not avoid the current economic downturn facing the United States and the dim prospects.

    The Economic Commission for Europe, in its report "The European Economy in 1957," acknowledged that the economic recession is continuing to develop in the United States, and the stagnation and recession of commercial activities has brought Western European countries into a difficult period.

    The Economic Commission for Europe acknowledged in its report that the economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies made great progress last year. The living standards of these countries are constantly rising, and industrial and agricultural production is rapidly and continuously increasing.

    Representatives of the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies also stated in their speeches that their countries are implementing or preparing to implement a series of long-term plans to promote further economic development, and at the same time they are willing to expand economic cooperation and trade with Western countries. The head of the Soviet delegation, Zakharov, pointed out in his speech that artificial trade barriers hinder trade exchanges between Eastern and Western Europe. He suggested that a meeting of ministers from the commission's member states be held before the end of this year to discuss the development of trade and technological exchanges between the member states.

    Although this proposal was not accepted by the commission due to the obstruction of representatives from certain Western countries, this session of the commission had to take into account the universally growing desire in the Western world for economic cooperation between East and West, and adopted some other related recommendations, such as a resolution on energy cooperation, a resolution on further developing contacts between countries participating in the work of the commission, a resolution on inter-regional cooperation, and a resolution on developing trade in consumer goods and exchanging production technologies on a commercial basis, and so on.

    联合国欧洲经济委会的报告承认
    西欧国家经济已进入困难时期
    社会主义国家经济获得巨大发展
    据新华社日内瓦24日电　本社记者张扬报道：对美国经济危机担心和对扩大东西方贸易的愿望更加迫切，是今晚在这里闭幕的联合国欧洲经济委员会第十三届会议中的主要情绪。
    出席这次会议的有来自东西欧国家和美国的二十八个代表团。
    在十七天的讨论中，几乎所有的与会者都谈到了经济危机问题。西方的代表们表示的不安情绪非常强烈，以致美国代表屡次站起来，鼓吹美国的战后发展并且列举正在实施和考虑的“反衰退措施”，企图给他们的对美国经济日益丧失信心的西方盟国打气。但是甚至他们自己也无法回避目前美国面临的不景气以及暗淡的前景。
    欧洲经济委员会在它所提出的“1957年欧洲经济情况”报告承认，经济衰退情况正在美国继续发展，商业活动的疲滞和不景气已经使西欧国家进入困难时期。
    欧洲经济委员会在报告中承认，苏联和东欧人民民主国家的经济在去年获得了巨大进展。这些国家的生活水平不断上升，工农业生产迅速不停的增加。
    苏联和东欧人民民主国家的代表也在发言中谈到，他们的国家正在实行或准备实行一系列促进经济进一步发展的长期计划，同时它们愿意扩大同西方国家的经济合作和贸易。苏联代表团团长扎哈罗夫在发言中指出：人为的贸易壁垒妨碍了东欧和西欧之间的贸易交流，他建议在今年年底以前召开委员会各成员国部长会议，讨论发展各成员国之间的贸易和技术交流的问题。
    尽管这项建议由于某些西方国家代表的阻挠没有被委员会接受，但是委员会的这届会议不得不考虑到要求东西方进行经济合作的愿望在西方世界普遍增长，通过了有关这方面的其他一些建议，例如关于动能合作的决议，关于进一步发展参加这个委员会工作的国家之间的接触的决议，关于地区之间的合作的决议以及关于发展消费品的贸易和在商业基础上交流生产技术的决议等等。
