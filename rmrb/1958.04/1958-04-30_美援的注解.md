A Note

    The American "National Planning Association" recently published a "statement" requesting the United States to increase private investment in Equatorial Africa, while also substantially increasing "economic aid" to that region, on the grounds that: "Equatorial Africa contains the world's largest human resources and natural resources."
    This "statement" is fairly frank. It equates investment with "aid," which is quite reasonable. The purposes of both are originally the same, namely plunder. As for what to plunder? The "statement" also provides an annotation: "Human resources and natural resources!"

    美援的注解
    美国“全国计划协会”最近发表了一篇“声明”，它要求美国增加对赤道非洲的私人投资，同时大量增加对那个地区的“经济援助”，理由是：“赤道非洲蕴藏着世界上最大的人力资源和天然资源”。
    这个“声明”算是比较坦白的。它把投资和“援助”相提并论，颇有道理。两者目的本来就是一样的，那就是掠夺。至于掠夺什么呢？“声明”中也有了注解：“人力资源和天然资源”！
