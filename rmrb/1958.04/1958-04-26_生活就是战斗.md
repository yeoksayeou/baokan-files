    Life is Struggle
    Shu Shibing, Dazhong Agricultural Cooperative, Gaocheng, Hebei

    After reading Zhi Ping's article "Breaking Another Convention" on page 8 of the People's Daily on April 2nd, which criticized the idea that the Great Leap Forward was too tense and that people should "sit down and quietly read books and engage in professional work," I felt deeply moved.
    Facts have proven that those with full political enthusiasm, after being tempered by the raging flames, not only have their ideological awareness improved, but also their professional work has leaped forward rapidly. Who can deny the miracles reported in the newspapers every day? Who can fail to see the new social outlook after the rectification campaign? Take us, these cadres who have been sent to the countryside, for example. We have people doing scientific research, teaching, and administrative management. From the second day we arrived in the countryside, we threw ourselves into the Great Leap Forward movement in the countryside, working with the peasants "using the moon as the sun, using human power instead of animal power, resting people and horses but not resting the carts." Just after completing the task of a five-day and five-night shock assault, we engaged in a seven-day battle to catch up with Zhengding and chase Macheng, truly "engaging in movements every month and creating high tides every step of the way." We are always in a state of tension. However, we do not feel bitter about this, but deeply feel that this is the most concrete way to seek happiness for the people.
    It is in such ordinary labor and ordinary life that our thoughts have changed with the pace of the countryside, and life has become richer and more meaningful.
    Life is struggle; to not advance is to fall behind. We often say that the boiling rural life of these few months can be worth three years or even more in the past, and this is not an exaggeration at all.

    生活就是战斗

    4月2日人民日报第八版知萍的“打破另一种常规”一文，批判了那种认为跃进太紧张了、要“坐下来静静地读读书搞搞业务”的思想。读了以后，深有感触。
    事实证明：有着饱满政治热情的人，经过熊熊火焰熏陶以后，不只思想觉悟有所提高，同时本门业务也在飞速地跃进。谁能抹煞每天报纸上报道的奇迹呢？谁能不看到整风后焕然一新的社会面貌呢？就以我们这些下放干部来说吧，我们里头有干科学研究的，有干教学的，有干行政管理的，从到农村的第二天起，就投身于农村大跃进运动中，跟农民一道“以月亮当太阳，以人力代畜力，歇人歇马不歇车”，刚完成突击五昼夜的任务，又来个鏖战七天赶正定、追麻城的战斗，正是“月月搞运动，节节闹高潮”。我们随时都处在紧张状态中。但是，我们并不以此为苦，却深深觉得这就是最具体的为人民谋幸福。
    就是在这样的平凡的劳动，平凡的生活里，我们的思想也就随着农村的脚步起了变化，生活越来越丰富越有内容。
    生活就是战斗，不前进就落后。我们常说这几个月沸腾的农村生活可以抵上过去的三年甚至更多的时间，一点也没有夸大。
