Xinhua News Agency, 8th: Beijing's Qianmen District, Dashilar, adjusted its commercial network in March.

The adjustment of the commercial network here was carried out based on the principles of both facilitating the masses and saving national funds, and breaking down industry boundaries and the boundaries between state-owned and joint state-private enterprises. After the adjustment, the original fifty-five stores have been merged into twenty-five, with the number of employees reduced by more than half. Several stores with unique characteristics and close ties to the people, such as the Tongrentang Chinese medicine store with a good reputation at home and abroad, the well-known Ruifuxiang textile general store, the Neiliansheng shoe store, and the Changhehou small goods store that sells needles, threads, and buttons, have all been retained. To meet customer demands, a consignment and resale department has also been added.

Qianmen Dashilar is one of the largest commercial clusters in Beijing. On a street only two hundred and fifty meters long, there were fifty-five stores, including seven department stores, fifteen clothing and shoe stores, five Chinese and Western medicine stores, and three non-staple food stores. The commodities sold by the same type of store were largely duplicated. Moreover, due to the large number of stores, each store did not have a complete range of products, and sometimes customers had to run to six or seven stores to buy suitable items. The duplication of goods and overstaffing led to low labor efficiency of employees, slow capital turnover, and wasteful phenomena such as high expenses. The dense concentration of stores, with most stores lacking dormitories and canteens, also brought many inconveniences to the lives of employees.

After the adjustment, the phenomenon of store duplication has been changed, and each store has a different division of labor. For example, of the original seven department stores, except for the retention of Changhehou, the remaining six were merged into three comprehensive department stores, one specializing in general small commodities, knitwear, and cosmetics, one specializing in daily-use industrial products, enamelware, small hardware, and specialty handicrafts, and the other specializing in children's products. Six shoe stores were merged into two, one mainly selling cloth shoes with layered soles, and the other mainly selling men's and women's leather shoes and embroidered women's shoes. In this way, the stores have a more complete range of goods, making it more convenient for customers to buy goods than in the past. During the adjustment, more than one hundred rooms were vacated throughout the street to serve as employee dormitories, lounges, and canteens, creating favorable conditions for store employees to implement the method of working one shift to the end.

After the adjustment of the commercial network, the sources of goods can be uniformly allocated, which is convenient for accounting. According to preliminary calculations, the inventory of goods can be reduced by more than 40% compared with the past, and the capital turnover will increase from an average of 6.63 times a year to 11.87 times. Personnel and various expenses can also be reduced, and the expense level will be reduced by half compared with the original.

    商业工作的大改革
    北京大栅栏调整商业网
    商店各有分工，商品增多，顾客方便；从业人员减少，经营改善，国家节约
    新华社8日讯　北京市前门区大栅栏的商业网在3月份作了调整。
    这里调整商业网，是本着既方便群众又节约国家资金的原则，并打破行业界限和国营、公私合营的界限进行的。经过调整，原来的五十五户商店已合并为二十五户，从业人员减少一半以上。几家具有特点以及与人民有密切联系的商店，如国内外有信誉的同仁堂国药店，远近知名的瑞蚨祥纺织品总店，内联升鞋店及经营针头线脑的长和厚小百货店等，都被保留下来。为了满足顾客要求，还增添了一个信托寄售部。
    前门大栅栏是北京市最大的商业群所在地之一。在仅仅长二百五十多公尺的街道上，排满了五十五户商店，其中百货店有七户，服装鞋帽店十五户，国药、新药店五户，副食品店三户。同一类商店经营的商品绝大部分是重复的。而且由于商店多，各店经营的品种不齐全，有时顾客跑六、七家商店也买不到合适的东西。各店商品重复，人浮于事，又造成职工劳动效率低、资金周转慢、费用开支大等浪费现象。商店密集，大部分商店没有宿舍、食堂，也给职工生活带来许多不便。
    经过调整，商店重复的现象已经改变，每个商店都有了不同的分工。比如原来的七个百货店，除了长和厚保留以外，其余六个合并为三个综合百货店，一个以经营一般小百货、针织品、化妆品为主，一个以经营日用工业品、搪瓷、小五金、特种工艺品为主，另一个以经营儿童用品为主。六户鞋店合并为两户，一个主要经营千层底布面鞋，另一个主要经营男女皮鞋和绣花女鞋。这样，各店的商品比较齐全，顾客买货就比过去方便了。在调整中，整个街上腾出了一百多间房子，作为职工宿舍、休息室和食堂，给商店职工实行一班顶到底的工作方法创造了良好的条件。
    商业网在调整以后，货源可以统一调配，便于核算，商品库存量据初步计算可以比过去减少40％以上，资金周转将由过去平均一年六点六三次提高到十一点八七次。人员和各项费用也都可以减少，费用水平将比原来降低一半。
