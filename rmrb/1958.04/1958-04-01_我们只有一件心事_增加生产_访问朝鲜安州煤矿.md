    We Have Only One Thing on Our Minds—Increase Production
    ——Visiting the Anzhou Coal Mine in Korea
    Our Newspaper Reporter Wang Yuzhang
    Sixty kilometers north of Pyongyang by car lies the famous twelve to thirteen thousand *li* plain of the Anzhou region. Since Korea completed the large-scale South Pyongan Province irrigation project after the war, diverting water from the Daedong River and the Chongchon River here, this alkaline plain near the west coast, with its sparse population and poor land, has been transformed into vast stretches of fertile land, becoming one of the main grain-producing areas in northern Korea. At the same time, this land not only produces golden rice, but also buries a rich industrial food underground—bituminous coal. The only bituminous coal mine in western Korea, the Anzhou Coal Mine, is located here. Looking out from the plain, drilling rigs stand everywhere. To supply the needs of the western railways and industry, the coal mine is being vigorously developed and is currently one of Korea's key construction coal mines.
    The reporter walked down along the No. 8 inclined shaft of the coal mine. In the wide and tall roadway newly built with concrete, electric winches dragged trains of coal-laden mine cars, rumbling past. In a coal mining area, workers were busily using shovels to load piles of newly blasted coal onto chain conveyors. The coal flowed like a small river along the constantly rotating chains onto belt conveyors, and then into mine cars... The coal miner Li Taigen told the reporter that when he first came to the coal mine three years ago, the quota for each coal miner was 2.5 tons; now, thanks to the efforts of the workers, the restoration of the mine, and the increase in mechanical equipment, the quota per person has increased to 4.8 tons. As a result, this coal mine produced 270,000 tons of coal last year, which is five times that of 1953 and three and a half times the highest annual output before liberation.
    If you understand the past of the Anzhou Coal Mine, you will feel how valuable the achievements of the Korean coal miners are today. Veteran miners told the reporter that this coal mine was completely different during the Japanese occupation. At that time, the Japanese invaders opened coal mines in Korea only to plunder coal and did not carry out any construction at all. Driven by the Japanese’s whips and sticks every day, the miners carried heavy coal, struggling forward, bent over in low and narrow tunnels, wading through knee-deep mud. Accidents occurred frequently in the mine, and almost every day people were carried out who had been crushed to death or injured. The highest annual output of this coal mine at that time was only more than 70,000 tons. After liberation, under the leadership of the Korean Workers’ Party and the Republic Government, the workers had just begun to improve production and working conditions, but the war broke out. The American invaders bombed all the above-ground equipment of the coal mine, and all the mining areas and roadways were flooded. The groundwater overflowed to a place 100 meters from the entrance of the mine. It is hard to imagine that coal could be mined again in a mine damaged to such an extent. However, the Korean coal miners were not intimidated by the difficulties. They began restoration work before the war had ended, pumping water and digging mud while repairing roadways and tunnels. Although it took eleven man-days to restore one meter of roadway or tunnel, people worked day and night, in the mud and water, and finally, in 1953, the year of the armistice, they produced more than 50,000 tons of coal for the country.
    More than four years after the armistice, the workers of the Anzhou Coal Mine, with the assistance of the brotherly Polish people, have not only restored the coal mine but are also building it into one of Korea's largest modern coal industry bases. Now, under the illumination of mine lamps, wide and tall permanent roadways have been constructed. The coal mine has powerful electric winches and more than 50 belt and chain conveyors, and has achieved 90% mechanization in coal transportation. This year, the construction project of the Anzhou Coal Mine is even more magnificent. An underground electric car route is being laid from the No. 8 inclined shaft to the No. 9 and No. 10 inclined shafts. In the No. 8 inclined shaft, a large belt conveyor more than 1,000 meters long, capable of transporting more than 2,400 tons of coal per day, will be newly installed this year to send the coal from inside the mine directly onto the train. In addition, more than ten coal cutters will be added this year to further mechanize coal mining. In order to rapidly increase coal production, a high-speed tunnel excavation movement is underway in the Anzhou Coal Mine. The miners' slogan is: This year, the excavation speed will be doubled, with three people in each group, excavating more than 100 meters per month. The miners are not satisfied with last year's coal production of 270,000 tons. This year they plan to overfulfill the state plan by 40,000 tons, producing a total of 350,000 tons of coal, and next year they will reach or exceed 500,000 tons. This leap-forward plan is encouraging the miners to build a new Anzhou Coal Mine with redoubled efforts.
    After the war, not only has production increased in the Anzhou Coal Mine, but the lives of the miners have also been significantly improved. As soon as you arrive in the Anzhou Coal Mine area, you will first see rows of newly built red-tiled and gray-walled workers' dormitories on both sides of the street. After the war, the Anzhou Coal Mine has built more than 700 workers' dormitories, which can accommodate more than 1,400 households. In addition, there is a collective dormitory that can accommodate 500 people.
    Wen Xueshan, an old miner with more than 30 years of service, described the changes in the lives of workers before and after liberation to the reporter. He stroked the thick cotton coat he was wearing and said, "Today, all of our coal miners are given such warm cotton coats by the state; but during the Japanese occupation, the winter clothes of the Anzhou coal miners were sacks and paper bags for cement." Fifty-one-year-old Wen Xueshan has been working in this coal mine since he was seventeen years old. At that time, he worked twelve hours a day, but could only get eighteen *qian* (one *jiao* eight *fen*) in wages from the Japanese. Now he is the leader of the fitter team, and his monthly income is nearly 10,000 North Korean won. In addition, like all miners, he enjoys the government's preferential treatment for miners, such as meat and cooking oil. Wen Xueshan said, "I was not able to go to school when I was young, but I only learned to read after liberation. Under the care of the Republic Government, my seven children have all gone to school. My second son is already a mechanical technician, and my third son is studying at a specialized school. Today, we workers have only one thing on our minds, and that is how to increase production."

    我们只有一件心事—增加生产
    ——访问朝鲜安州煤矿
    本报记者　王玉章
    从平壤乘汽车北行六十多公里，就到了安州地区的有名的十二三千里平原。自从朝鲜在战后建成了规模宏大的平安南道灌溉工程，把大同江和清川江的水引到这里来以后，这片靠近西海岸而且人少地贫的碱地平原就变成了万顷良田，成为朝鲜北部的主要产粮区之一。同时，这片土地还不仅生产金黄色的稻谷，地下还埋藏着丰富的工业的粮食——烟煤。朝鲜西部唯一的一座烟煤矿——安州煤矿就在这里。从平原上望去，到处矗立着钻探机的架子，为了供应西部铁路和工业的需要，煤矿正在大力开发着，它是当前朝鲜重点建设的煤矿之一。
    记者沿着煤矿的八号斜井走下去，在用混凝土新筑成的宽阔高大的巷道里，电力卷扬机拖着满载煤炭的一列列的矿车从身边隆隆而过。在一个采煤场上，工人们正在紧张地用铁锹把刚刚爆破下来的一堆堆的煤炭装上链式运煤机，煤炭沿着不停转动的链条，像一条小河一样流到皮带运煤机上，又流进矿车……。采煤工李泰根告诉记者，他在三年前刚来煤矿时，每个采煤工的定额是二点五吨；现在由于工人们的努力，矿井的恢复和机械设备的增加，每人的定额已增加到四点八吨。这样，去年这个煤矿就生产了二十七万吨煤，等于1953年的五倍，等于解放前最高年产量的三倍半。
    如果你了解了安州煤矿的过去，就会感到朝鲜煤矿工人取得今天的成就是多么可贵。煤矿的老矿工对记者说，这个煤矿在日本统治时期完全是另一个样子。那时，日本侵略者在朝鲜开煤矿只是为了掠夺煤炭，根本不进行什么建设。矿工们每天在日本人的皮鞭和棍子的驱赶下，背着沉重的煤炭，在又低又窄的坑道里，在深达膝盖的泥水中，弯腰曲背地挣扎着前进。矿里经常发生事故，差不多每天都有被压死或压伤的人抬出来。这个煤矿在那时的最高年产量只有七万多吨。解放后，在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，工人们刚刚开始进行改善生产、改善劳动条件的工作，可是战争爆发了。美国侵略者炸毁了这个煤矿所有的井上设备，全部采煤场和巷道都被水淹了。地下水一直溢到离井口一百公尺的地方。人们简直很难想像在破坏到这样程度的矿井里还能够再挖出煤来。可是，朝鲜的煤矿工人们没有被困难吓住，他们在战争还没有停止的时候就开始了恢复工作，一边抽水挖泥，一边补修巷道和坑道。虽然每恢复一公尺长的巷道或坑道就要费十一个人工，但是人们不避艰难，日日夜夜，泥里水里地工作着，终于在停战的那一年——1953年，就为国家生产了五万多吨煤炭。
    在停战后四年多的今天，安州煤矿的工人们在兄弟般的波兰人民的援助下，不仅把煤矿恢复起来了，而且正在把它建设成为朝鲜最大的现代化的煤炭工业基地之一。现在，在矿灯的照耀下，一条条的宽阔高大的永久性的巷道建设起来了。煤矿内有强大有力的电力卷扬机，有五十多台皮带式和链式运输机，在运煤方面已达到90％的机械化。今年安州煤矿的建设工程更为宏伟。从八号斜井到九号和十号斜井，一条井内电车路线正在铺设着。在八号斜井，今年还要新设一台长达一千多公尺每天能运二千四百多吨煤的大型皮带运煤机，把煤从井内一直送上火车。另外，今年还要增添十多台截煤机，使采煤工作进一步机械化。为了迅速增产煤炭，一个高速度坑道掘进运动正在安州煤矿展开着。矿工的口号是：今年要把掘进速度提高一倍，每个小组三个人，每月要掘进一百多公尺。矿工们对去年二十七万吨的产煤量很不满足，他们今年准备要超额国家计划四万吨、共生产三十五万吨煤，到明年就要达到或超过五十万吨。这个跃进式的计划，正鼓舞着矿工们用加倍的干劲来建设新的安州煤矿。
    战后的安州煤矿不仅生产增长了，矿工们的生活也得到显著的改善。一到安州煤矿矿区首先看到的就是街道两旁新建的一片片的红瓦灰墙的工人宿舍。战后安州煤矿已建设了七百多幢工人宿舍，能容一千四百多户。另外还有一幢能容五百人的集体宿舍。
    有三十多年工龄的老矿工文学善对记者叙述了解放前后工人生活的变化。他抚摸着身上穿的厚厚的棉衣说：“今天我们煤矿工人都由国家发给了这样暖的棉衣；可是在日本统治时期，安州煤矿工人的冬装是麻袋片和装洋灰的纸袋子。”五十一岁的文学善从十七岁就在这个煤矿作工，那时他每天作十二个小时的工，却只能从日本人手中拿到十八钱（一角八分）工钱。现在他担任钳工班长，每月的收入将近一万元朝币。另外还同所有的矿工一样，享受着肉类、食油等政府给矿工的优待。文学善说：“我小时没有能够上学，解放以后才学习识字。在共和国政府的关怀下，我的七个儿女都上了学。二儿子已是机械技师，三儿子正在专科学校学习。今天我们工人只有一件心事，就是如何来增加生产。”（附图片）
