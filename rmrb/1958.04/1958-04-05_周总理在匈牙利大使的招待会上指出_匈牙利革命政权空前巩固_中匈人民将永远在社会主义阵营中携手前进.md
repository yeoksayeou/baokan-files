Xinhua News Agency, April 4th - At the grand reception held tonight by Hungarian Ambassador to China, Nográdi, to celebrate the 13th anniversary of Hungary's liberation, Premier Zhou Enlai and Ambassador Nográdi both emphasized that the Hungarian People's Republic is more consolidated than ever before and has made important contributions to strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and maintaining world peace.

The Romanian guests headed by Chairman Chivu Stoica attended today's reception. The reception, attended by more than 400 people, began with the playing of the national anthems of China and Hungary. In his speech at the reception, Premier Zhou Enlai said: "In the past one year, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, the Hungarian people have achieved significant successes in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, restoring and developing the socialist economy, strengthening the unity between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and maintaining world peace. We can say without exaggeration that the Hungarian People's Republic today is more consolidated than ever before."

He emphasized: "This year will be a year in which the Hungarian People's Republic continues to achieve significant successes in all aspects. I would like to take this opportunity to wish the Hungarian people continuous new victories." "The Chinese people will forever advance hand in hand with the Hungarian people in the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union."

Ambassador Nográdi also spoke with confidence about the failure of American imperialism's attempt to separate Hungary from the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; the Hungarian people have "repelled the enemy's attack and crushed the counter-revolutionary riot supported by imperialism."

The Ambassador also expressed special thanks to the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries for the assistance they provided to the Hungarian people in defending their independence, freedom, and socialist cause. He affirmed: "The Hungarian people have always been united around the government and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, enthusiastically carrying out socialist construction tasks. They are a reliable pillar of the unity of socialist countries, striving with all their strength to maintain peace, and maintaining national sovereignty and domestic socialist order with high vigilance. We are confident that we can most effectively and forcefully defend the noble cause of peace, friendship between nations, and peaceful coexistence."

In their speeches, Premier Zhou and Ambassador Nográdi also unanimously and enthusiastically supported a series of peace initiatives recently proposed by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and they expressed their willingness to work together to further develop Sino-Hungarian friendship and cooperation and to safeguard world peace. Premier Zhou said: "The series of major peace initiatives proposed by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries make lasting world peace more realistic and greatly encourage the confidence of the people of all countries in the world to strive for peace."

At the reception, Ambassador Nográdi warmly congratulated Chairman Chivu Stoica and all the distinguished guests of the Romanian government delegation on their good health, and congratulated the Romanian People's Republic on its prosperity and strength.

    周总理和诺格拉第大使在讲话中还一致热烈支持苏联和其他社会主义国家最近提出的一系列和平倡议，并且要为进一步发展中匈友谊合作和保卫世界和平而共同努力。周总理说：“苏联和其他社会主义国家提出的一系列的重大和平倡议，使持久的世界和平具有更大的现实性，使世界各国人民为和平而奋斗的信心得到极大的鼓舞。”
