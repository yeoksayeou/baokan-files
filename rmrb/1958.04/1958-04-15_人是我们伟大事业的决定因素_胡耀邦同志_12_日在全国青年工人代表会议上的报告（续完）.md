    (Continued from yesterday)
    Proficient operation is important even for ordinary general workers and manual laborers. Some say that we don't have good machines or new equipment in our area, so there is no need for proficient operation. This statement is also incorrect. Take cleaning workers, for example, they also need to understand how to use a broom better to do the cleaning work quickly, cleanly, and effortlessly. We should also see that the more proficient the operation skills, the more it can promote the reform of production tools. Many production tools have been generated and developed on the basis of past proficient operations. As long as we all strive to improve the proficiency of various operating techniques, it is possible to have a mass movement of universally improving tools and creating new tools.
    Is it very difficult to achieve proficiency in operation? We say it is both difficult and not difficult. It is difficult because it requires us to spend more time learning and pay the price. Any skilled operation is the result of thousands of hard practices. Only practice can make perfect, and proficiency leads to ingenuity. It is not difficult because as long as we are willing to put our heart into it and work hard to learn, there is no technology that cannot be learned in the world.
    The Communist Youth League organizations should make great efforts to care for the rapid growth of young workers in technology. In the past, we adopted many effective methods, and we should continue to adopt these methods in the future. To cultivate Chinese young workers into a generation with awareness, organization, and discipline is only one aspect of our task. To cultivate Chinese youth into a generation with technology, culture, and modern scientific knowledge is another aspect of our task. Only by doing a good job in these two aspects can our Communist Youth League fulfill its due responsibilities to the youth.

    We must greatly promote diligent study
    In order to effectively master technology and improve our skills, we must also greatly promote diligent study. In the past few years, many comrades have studied very well. They have not only done their work well but also increased their skills, and have learned both politics and technology. Why are they able to learn so well? This is because, first, they have the correct learning purpose; second, they are good at learning from teachers; and third, they also make time.
    Whether the purpose of learning is correct is the key to whether we can learn well. There are some people who also work hard in their studies, but their purpose of learning is for promotion, for bonuses, and for money. When this purpose is not achieved, they become discouraged and stop. Therefore, all those who learn with individualistic purposes cannot only not last, but will eventually hit a wall. All revolutionary youth certainly cannot adopt this attitude. We study for the needs of the country's construction, and to increase our ability to serve the people. With the correct purpose of learning, a force will be generated that enables us to stubbornly overcome all obstacles on the road forward and never be complacent.
    For our youth, being good at learning from teachers is an important condition for us to learn more, learn faster, and learn better. There are many teachers. The Party is our teacher. The old workers are our teachers. Advanced producers are our teachers. Anyone with a skill can be our teacher. Even if someone is worse than me in other aspects, but is better than me in one aspect, he can also be my teacher in this point. This is how we should view the question of who can be our teacher. We must also adopt a correct attitude towards teachers. Here, I want to focus on talking about how to learn from old workers. Old workers are our closest teachers both politically and technically. They are willing to pass on all their experiences to young workers. At this conference, many old workers mentioned this. Unfortunately, some young workers become proud and look down on the old workers when they have learned a little bit of skill. There is such a story: an apprentice worshiped an old worker named Du as his master. When he first entered the factory, the apprentice respectfully called the old worker "Master Du." After four months, he felt that his skills were almost the same as his master's, so he called him "Old Du." After another four months, he felt that his skills were even better than his master's, and he didn't even call him Old Du, but called him "Belly Up." This attitude is unacceptable. The rich knowledge and experience accumulated by old workers over decades is by no means something we can learn completely and well in a short period of time. Even if some comrades surpass the old workers in certain aspects, there is no reason to be proud. "Don't forget the well-diggers when drinking water, and don't forget the tree planters when enjoying the shade." We young people must always respect the old predecessors who have made contributions to the country and are enthusiastic about training us.
    Learning requires teachers, but to learn well, one must also rely on one's own hard work. Concentrating on production and doing a good job in production, concentrating on work and doing a good job in work, this is the best learning. However, this kind of learning alone is not enough; we must also use our spare time to study. In the vigorous construction work, our lives are always very tense. To learn, we must know how to make time. We are not robots and should have necessary rest and necessary cultural entertainment, but we should not spend a lot of our spare time on too much cultural entertainment. Not seizing the time to study in youth is the biggest waste. Therefore, we hope that young comrades can spend more than half of their spare time studying. Since we are the masters of the country, we must also be the masters of time.
    We often say that the Communist Youth League organizations should care about the progress of the youth, care about the growth of the youth, which is to care about their learning. We believe that after this conference, our League organizations will guide and organize the national youth to set off a new upsurge of marching towards culture, science, and technology.

    We must not only study diligently but also create bravely. Chairman Mao taught us to combine learning with originality. Why must we combine learning with originality? Our diligent study is to inherit and master the various knowledge and experiences that mankind has created and accumulated. However, it is far from enough to simply inherit and master existing knowledge and experience. We must also enrich existing knowledge and create more advanced experience on the basis of learning and practice. All the achievements of culture, science, and technology in the world today are the result of people's labor and creation. If people in the past had not created, there would be no such achievements today. If we are only satisfied with the existing achievements today and no longer engage in new creations, then our society cannot continue to move forward. It is precisely because of this reason that our Party has always advocated that people dare to create and dare to innovate. Only by daring to break through all the old things that are no longer adapted and boldly create new things can our great socialist cause develop rapidly.
    To create bravely, we must first dare to think boldly. All advanced things and inventions in human history have gradually become a reality from bold imagination. Because people wanted to fly into the sky, they created airplanes. Because people wanted to go to the moon, they created artificial satellites. We can cite countless such facts. However, such a very common truth is often forgotten by people. Some of our comrades believe that we cannot say things that have not been said in books; things that have never existed in the past cannot exist now; and things that others have not done, we cannot do. In fact, those things that have been said in books, that have existed in the past, and that others have done, were all created by people. We must understand this truth: as long as things conform to the laws of the development of objective things, they can always be done. Even if they cannot be done temporarily, they will definitely be done in the future. Therefore, our young comrades must dare to think boldly, and never confine our minds. After the great rectification movement, many of our young comrades dared to think and create boldly. In January and February of this year, the Youth Solidarity Furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel achieved a new record of reaching a utilization coefficient of 1.064 tons for the furnace bottom of large open-hearth furnaces nationwide, far exceeding the United Kingdom and the United States, and entering the ranks of the world's advanced levels. In February of this year, Comrade Zhang Yukun, a young worker at the Xinxiang Battery Factory in Henan, created an air battery lamp that is very suitable for the current needs of rural areas. Feng Changxing, an ordinary worker from the Fourth Engineering Section of the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways in Shaanxi Province, created a hydraulic winch that automatically moves stones using hydraulic power, replacing heavy physical labor. In particular, the successful trial production of reactive dyes and the creation of the three-tap steelmaking method can inspire people's thinking even more. Comrade Xi Xiangyun, a young technician at the Shanghai Runhua Dye Factory, under the slogan of catching up with and surpassing the United Kingdom, thought, "If the United Kingdom can manufacture active dyes that never fade, why can't we manufacture them? We must manufacture them." Under the guidance of this bold idea, he conducted two months of tenacious experiments and finally produced active dyes that are now only available in a few countries in the world. The three-tap steelmaking method was created by the No. 3 open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the employees of the steelmaking department boldly considered, "If we can tap steel from two taps, why can't we tap steel from three taps?" It was precisely because of this advanced idea that they finally successfully tested the three-tap steelmaking method, opening up a path of technological innovation for China's steel industry.

    To create bravely, we also need to conduct tenacious experiments. A grand ideal, a beautiful hope, an advanced plan, an important invention, to turn it into reality, always requires countless experiments and practices; and in the process of experiments and practices, it is always possible to suffer setbacks and failures. Therefore, people who are unwilling to conduct arduous experiments and practices, or who cannot withstand setbacks and failures, will always only be daydreamers. Do you all know the two drugs "914" and "606"? Why are they called "914" and "606"? It is because one was successful after 914 experiments, and the other was successful after 606 experiments. If the experimenters lacked a persevering spirit, and "914" was abandoned after 913 experiments, and "606" was abandoned after 605 experiments, then these two drugs would probably not have been created until now. The great scientist Madame Curie spent a full four years, after countless failures, before discovering radium. Therefore, our young comrades must have this spirit, that is, for things that can be done and can be done, we must resolutely do them, constantly summarize experience, correct mistakes, and not be shaken by any setbacks and failures, and never give up until the goal is achieved.
    In the great technological revolution, while guiding young people to do their jobs well, encouraging and supporting the creative spirit of the vast number of young people to think boldly and experiment tenaciously is a very important task for the Communist Youth League organization. When young comrades encounter difficulties and setbacks in experimentation and creation, they should be encouraged and cheered on, rather than pouring cold water on them. Now we have more than 32,000 youth shock teams and youth advanced groups across the country. We should not only regard these organizations as shock forces for breaking through quotas, but also regard these organizations as important bases for taking the lead in experimenting and promoting advanced technologies. Aren’t the cadres of our factory and mine League organizations asking how to learn technology? Participating in these advanced groups and experimenting with them is the best way to learn technology.

    Cultivate the virtues of diligence and thrift in daily life
    In order to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland, we must also resolutely implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on building the country with diligence and thrift, running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, and managing the family with diligence and thrift. Diligence and thrift are a manifestation of the ambition and awareness of the young people of our New China.
    Some young people think that everything will be fine when we reach a socialist society, and happiness will fly to us like a peacock. Of course, this is not right. Chairman Mao taught us: The establishment of the socialist system has opened up a path for us to reach the ideal state, but the realization of the ideal state still depends on our hard work. All our young workers across the country must always remember this teaching, make up their minds, fight hard for several years, and use their diligent hands to change the poor and backward face of our country and build a happy life. Doing so, of course, will be more tiring and harder in the present. But this is precisely to make a better and happier life come sooner, that is, to benefit our descendants. Therefore, we are willing to endure temporary difficulties, happily welcome the difficulties on the road forward, and bravely overcome these difficulties.
    In the recent anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of young workers took the lead in igniting the fire of anti-waste, organized thousands of youth shock teams, exposed a large number of waste phenomena, and tried every means to save a lot of wealth for the country. The facts show that the potential for saving in factories and mining enterprises is great, the methods of saving are many, and young workers have a lot to do in this regard. According to the experience of various places, we can carry out the following saving activities:
    First, improve the design and eliminate drawing errors. Recently, the young engineering and technical personnel of the Third Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways in Tianjin put forward the fighting slogan of "eliminate waste on the drawings and don't let waste go out of the door." After five rescues, they saved 280 million yuan for the country. If every young designer in the country participates in this activity, how much wealth will it save for our country?
    Second, eliminate defective products and improve product quality. Producing defective products is the biggest waste. Now, young workers in various places have made achievements in reducing defective products and improving quality. Comrade Wang Kexu, a young grinding worker in Harbin, has made nearly 50,000 precision products in more than four years without producing any defective products. The young welding section of Dalian Shipyard has completely eliminated defective products. There are more and more such examples. On this basis, we should carry out the activities of producing no or fewer defective products with excellent quality more deeply and persistently.
    Third, save raw materials and use substitutes. With the development of production, the demand for raw materials is increasing day by day. This requires us to work hard to save raw materials and widely use substitutes. The Li Chunjing team of the power outer line of Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is determined to make the iron rods saved in 1958 enough to circle Beijing, and the copper wires saved enough to circle Beijing twice. Changzhou Pu Liren Oil Factory uses rice straw to brew wine first, then uses it as feed or paper, and uses rice bran to extract oil first, then brew wine, and then use it as feed. This shows that our potential for saving raw materials is great, and there are broad prospects for using substitutes.
    Fourth, take care of tools and maintain equipment. Taking care of tools, maintaining equipment, and striving not to have accidents that damage machines and equipment are still an important task in our saving activities. The young workers of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory recently launched an activity to repair old tools. Repairing just over 1,200 tools saved the country more than 15,000 yuan. Their practice is worth promoting.
    Fifth, make full use of working hours and save auxiliary time. Speed is the decisive factor for us to win in the competition with capitalism. We cannot let every minute of production time pass in vain, and we must make every minute of time create wealth for the country. One of the important reasons why young turners Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande of Dalian Shipyard were able to complete nine years of tasks in five years is that they regarded "not wasting every minute of production time" as their motto.
    Sixth, collect waste materials and utilize waste materials. The collection of waste materials has achieved great results in various places, and we must continue to carry out activities in this area. At present, it is even more important to make full use of these waste materials. In order to present gifts to this conference, the young workers of Shanghai used waste materials to manufacture nearly a thousand machine tools and 280,000 various products. This activity is worth promoting.
    Of course, the methods of saving are not limited to these, such as cleaning up large warehouses, opening up small warehouses, extending the use of work clothes, etc., which can be carried out according to specific circumstances.
    The Communist Youth League organizations should fully explain the significance of carrying out saving activities to the youth, specifically calculate the economic effects of youth saving activities, propose certain goals to strive for, and closely cooperate with the trade unions to jointly organize the youth to achieve them. The Communist Youth League organizations should also strengthen the education of young people on building the country with diligence and thrift and loving the factory as a home in the saving activities, so that young people can treat public property with a communist attitude.
    Every young worker comrade should not only be a saving expert in production, but also be a thrifty person in life. Recently, the young people of Jiangsu Province responded to the call of the Provincial Committee of the League and successively formulated "small plans for diligence and thrift," and they will save 15 million yuan in two years. This is a very meaningful thing. Savings can not only increase construction funds for the country, but also help us arrange our lives in a planned way. Young people who are not married can also make necessary reserves for the needs after starting a family. If every young worker saves an average of 5% of his salary every month, calculating that 10 million young workers across the country save an average of two yuan per month, then 1.2 billion yuan can be saved during the Second Five-Year Plan period. This money can build 300 thermal power plants with 5,000 kilowatts, or 500 chemical fertilizer plants with an annual output of 10,000 tons. We hope that young workers across the country will enthusiastically participate in saving activities. We must cultivate the virtues of diligence and thrift in our daily lives.

    Promote the spirit of unity and fraternity
    For our common great cause, our working class must further strengthen unity. Our young workers should be the most conscious part of the youth of all strata in our country, and should also become models for promoting the spirit of unity and fraternity.
    Modern industrial production requires close collaboration. Close collaboration is needed between various industrial departments, between factories, between workshops, between work sections, and between shifts. The backwardness of one department's production will affect the forward development of the entire production. And when the balance in the entire production is broken through by an advanced unit, this requires the advanced unit to help the backward units catch up quickly with the communist spirit of collaboration and establish a new balance. Only in this way can our entire construction cause develop rapidly and rhythmically. In this regard, there are many touching examples. In order to make the quality of its products catch up with the United Kingdom rapidly, the young workers of Shanghai Meicheng Electric Factory decided to build a vacuum tank ahead of schedule without state investment. However, they encountered many difficulties in terms of both factory conditions and technology. As soon as the news spread, more than 20 units came to actively assist them voluntarily. Some rushed to help with the design, some worked overtime to cast parts overnight, some gave up the site for building the factory, and some cleaned up the foundation of the factory with voluntary labor. As a result, the task of construction was completed ahead of schedule. The young workers of Shijiazhuang State-owned Cotton Factory No. 1, whose production was backward, formed a shock team to catch up with the advanced, and the best young workers in production were appointed as captains. As a result, the backward quickly caught up with the advanced. We young workers should promote the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual cooperation, and unity and fraternity in production like them.
    Among our young workers, there are also some comrades with relatively poor ideological awareness or who have made some mistakes. We should give them comradely care. For us communists, it is a very uncomfortable thing to see that our companions have ideological problems, are carrying heavy burdens, cannot walk, and are about to fall behind. We must reach out and help them. How can we help them? Chairman Mao taught us to start from the desire for unity, go through criticism, and achieve new unity on a new basis. That is to say, for their mistakes, we must adopt an attitude of curing diseases and saving people, and carry out serious criticism; at the same time, we must help them catch up with the team with full enthusiasm and patience. We must believe that they can make progress. Iron and steel can be melted as long as they are over 1,000 degrees. The heat of the hearts of us communists is 10,000 degrees. Can’t we still help transform our backward companions?

    Contribute all our strength to the cause of communism
    At this conference, the comrades also talked about many examples of supporting our farmer brothers. Some manufactured various new agricultural tools, machines, and small tractors for the farmers. Some helped agricultural cooperatives repair machinery and impart technical knowledge. These activities are all very good. The peasants are our dear brothers. The countryside is the market for industrial products and the base for industrial raw materials. Supporting the peasants is our working class's duty. Now, our local industries are developing in large numbers. Local industries mainly serve agriculture. Our young workers must also enthusiastically support the development of local industries, let technology go to the countryside, let machines sound everywhere, and let factories spread all over the cities and countryside.
    Both the trade unions and the Communist Youth League are the links between the Party and the masses, and both are communist schools. Our goals are the same. Our tasks are the same. In our work, we have established close cooperation. In the past few years, the trade unions have provided a lot of support and help to the work of the Communist Youth League. Our Communist Youth League organizations should also more actively support the activities of the trade unions. Let us work together to do a better job in cultivating and educating young workers.
    Comrades, my speech is coming to an end. I have already said above that people are the decisive factor in our great cause. What kind of people are we? We are people of the Mao Zedong era, we are young people of the Mao Zedong era. Our Party and revolutionary predecessors have created a brand-new world for us, and have opened up a bright road to communism for us. Now, we should give full play to our dynamism, do what the motherland needs us to do, and do things that our predecessors have never done before.
    Our conference is a conference to enhance our ambitions. During the conference, we visited the revolutionary historical sites of the Shanghai workers' movement and listened to the older generation of workers introduce their moving revolutionary experiences, which gave us an extremely profound education. We should inherit the revolutionary spirit of the older generation and make such a grand ambition: we must, under the leadership of the Party, together with the people of the whole country, build our motherland into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.
    Our conference is also a conference to increase our skills. After the rectification movement, our awareness has been improved, and our revolutionary enthusiasm is even greater. However, we will never be complacent, and we must continue to strengthen ourselves, enrich ourselves, and improve ourselves. We should live up to the expectations of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and we must quickly cultivate ourselves into soldiers of the working class with awareness, organization, discipline, and cultural science and technology.
    Our conference is also a conference for mutual learning. In the conference, everyone exchanged experiences and visited the largest industrial city in our country. The Party and government of Shanghai gave us great help. The working class of Shanghai gave our conference warm care and support. The vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai gave us great encouragement. We must bring everything good we have seen and learned in Shanghai back to our respective positions, and let it blossom and bear fruit throughout the country.
    Our conference is also a general mobilization conference. We should turn the hopes of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao for us, the advanced experience introduced at this conference, and the initiatives and decisions passed by the conference—in a word, the common will expressed by our conference—into practical actions of the 10 million young workers across the country.
    Comrades, let us unite more closely and, under the leadership of our great Party and Chairman Mao, contribute all our strength to the motherland, to the people, and to the cause of communism.

    人是我们伟大事业的决定因素
    胡耀邦同志12日在全国青年工人代表会议上的报告（续完）
    （续昨）
    熟练的操作，对一个普通的勤杂工、粗工来说，也是重要的。有人说我们那里没有好的机器，没有新的设备，没有熟练操作的必要。这种说法同样是不对的。就拿清洁工人来说，他也要懂得如何更好地使用扫把，把清洁工作做得又快、又干净、又省力。我们更应该看到，操作技能越熟练，就越能够促进生产工具的改革。许多生产工具，都是在过去熟练操作的基础上产生和发展起来的。只要我们大家都努力提高各种操作技术的熟练程度，就有可能出现一个普遍的改进工具和创造新工具的群众性的运动。
    要使操作达到熟练的程度，是不是很困难呢？我们说，也困难也不困难。说它困难，是因为它要我们花较多的时间去学习，要付出代价。任何熟练的操作，都是千百次苦练的结果。只有练才能熟，熟了就能生巧。说它不难，是因为只要我们肯用心，肯下苦功夫去学，天下是没有学不好的技术的。
    共青团组织应当用极大的努力关心广大青年职工在技术上迅速地成长。过去我们采取了许多行之有效的方法，这些方法我们今后还应当继续采用。把我国青年工人培养成为有觉悟、有组织、有纪律的一代，这只是我们一方面的任务。把我国青年培养成为有技术、有文化、有现代科学知识的一代，是我们另一方面的任务。只有作好了这两方面的工作，我们共青团才尽到了对青年应尽的责任。
    要大大地提倡刻苦学习
    为了有效地掌握技术，提高本领，我们还要大大地提倡刻苦学习。几年以来，有许多同志是学得很好的。他们既做好了工作，又增长了本领，既学到了政治，又学到了技术。为什么他们能够学得很好呢？这就是由于他们，第一有正确的学习目的，第二善于拜老师，第三还会挤时间。
    学习的目的是否正确，是我们能不能学好的关键。有一种人，他学习也是努力的，但是，他的学习目的是为了提级，为了奖金，为了人民币。当这种目的达不到的时候，他们就泄气了，停顿了。因而一切抱着个人主义的目的去学习的人，不但不能持久，而且最后总是要碰壁的。一切革命青年当然不能采取这种态度。我们是为了祖国建设的需要而学习，是为了增长为人民服务的本领而学习。学习的目的正确了，就会产生一股力量，使我们能够顽强地排除前进道路上的一切障碍，并且永不自满。
    对我们青年来说，善于拜老师是使我们学得多、学得快、学得好的一个重要的条件。老师是很多的。党是我们的老师。老工人是我们的老师。先进生产者是我们的老师。任何有一技之长的人都可以做我们的老师。即使某个人在其他方面都比我差，但在某一点上比我强，在这一点上，他也可以做我的老师。我们就是要这样的来看待谁可以做我们老师的问题。我们还要采取正确的态度去对待老师。这里，我想着重谈一谈关于如何向老工人学习的问题。老工人不论在政治上和技术上都是我们最亲近的老师。他们是愿意把自己的全部经验传授给青年工人的。在这次会议上，许多老工人都说到了这一点。可惜，某些青年工人，当学到一点本领的时候，就骄傲起来，就看不起老工人了。有这样一个故事，有一个学徒拜了一个姓杜的老工人做师傅，刚进厂的时候，这个学徒恭恭敬敬地叫这位老工人为杜师傅。过了四个月，他觉得自己的本事和师傅差不多了，就叫他“老杜”。又过了四个月，他觉得自己的本事比师傅还高明，连老杜也不叫了，而叫他“肚皮朝天”了。这种态度是要不得的。老工人几十年所积累的丰富的知识和经验，绝不是我们在短时期内就能够学全、学好的。即使有些同志在某些方面超过了老工人，也没有任何理由可以骄傲。“饮水不忘掘井人，乘凉不忘种树人”，对于为祖国做出了贡献，热心培养我们的老前辈们，我们青年人要永远尊敬他们。
    学习要有老师，但是，要学得好还得靠自己的刻苦努力。在生产中专心致意把生产搞好，在工作中专心致意地把工作做好，这就是最好的学习。但是，只有这种学习还不够，还要利用业余时间进行学习。在蓬勃的建设工作中，我们的生活总是很紧张的。要学习，就要会挤时间。我们不是机器人，应该有必要的休息、必要的文化娱乐，但是，我们也不应该把大量的业余时间耗费在过多的文化娱乐上。在青年时期不抓紧学习，这是最大的浪费。因此，我们希望青年同志都能够拿出一半以上的业余时间来进行学习。既然我们是国家的主人，我们也一定要做时间的主人。
    我们经常说共青团组织要关心青年的进步，要关心青年的成长，就是要关心他们的学习。我们相信，在这次会议以后，我们团的组织将引导和组织全国青年掀起一个新的向文化、向科学、向技术进军的热潮。
    我们不仅要刻苦学习，还要勇敢创造。毛主席教导我们，要把学习和独创精神结合起来。为什么必须把学习和独创精神结合起来呢？我们刻苦的学习，是为了继承和掌握人类已经创造和积累的各种知识和经验。但是，单单继承和掌握现有的知识和经验，是很不够的，我们还必须在学习和实践的基础上，丰富现有的知识和创造更先进的经验。世界上现有的一切文化科学技术的成就，没有一样不是人们劳动创造的结果。如果过去的人们没有创造，就不会有今天这样的成就。如果我们今天只是满足于现有的成就，不再进行新的创造，那么，我们的社会就不可能继续前进。正是因为这个道理，我们的党一贯提倡人们要勇于创造，勇于革新。只有敢于突破一切不适应了的旧的东西，大胆创造新的东西，我们伟大的社会主义事业，才有可能突飞猛进地向前发展。
    要勇敢创造，首先就要敢于大胆思考。人类历史上的一切先进事物和创造发明，都是从大胆的想像逐渐变为现实的。由于人们想飞上天去，人们才创造了飞机。由于人们想到月亮上去，人们才创造了人造卫星。像这样的事实，我们可以举出无数的来。但是，这样一个很普通的道理却常常被人们所忘记。我们有些同志认为，书本上没有说过的事情，我们就不能说；过去从来没有过的事情，现在就不能有；别人没有干过的事情，我们就不能干。其实，那些书本上说过的、过去有过的、别人干过的事情，也都是人们创造出来的。我们一定要懂得这样一条真理，只要是符合客观事物发展规律的事情，总是可以办到的。即使暂时办不到，将来也一定可以办到。因此，我们青年同志要敢于大胆地想，千万不要把我们的头脑禁闭起来。经过伟大的整风运动，我们许多青年同志更加敢于大胆的思考，大胆的创造了。鞍钢的青年团结炉，在今年一、二月份，就创造了全国大型平炉炉底利用系数达到一零点六四吨的新纪录，远远地超过了英国和美国，走进了世界先进水平的行列。河南新乡电池厂的青年工人张玉坤同志，在今年二月份，创造了非常适合当前农村需要的空气电池灯。陕西省铁道部第六工程局第四工程段的普通工冯长兴同志，创造了利用水力自动搬石头的水力绞车，代替了笨重的体力劳动。特别是活性染料的试制成功和三槽出钢法的创造，更能启发人们的思想。上海润华染料厂的青年技术员奚翔云同志，在赶上和超过英国的口号下，他就想，英国能够制造永不褪色的活性染料，我们为什么就不能制造呢？我们一定要把它制造出来。就在这种大胆的思想指导下，他进行了两个月的顽强试验，终于制成了现在世界上只有几个国家才有的活性染料。三槽出钢是太原钢铁厂炼钢部三号平炉创造的。在大跃进的形势下，炼钢部的职工同志大胆的考虑，能够双槽出钢，为什么不能三槽出钢呢？正是由于有了这种先进思想，他们终于将三槽出钢试验成功，为我国的钢铁工业，开辟了一条技术革新的道路。
    要勇敢创造，还需要进行顽强的试验。一个远大的理想，一个美好的希望，一个先进的计划，一个重要的发明创造，要把它变成现实，总是要经过无数次的试验和实践；而在试验和实践的过程中，总是可能遭受到挫折和失败的。因此，不愿意进行艰苦的试验和实践，或是经受不起挫折和失败的人，就永远只能是一个空想家。大家知道“九一四”和“六○六”这两种药品吗？为什么叫“九一四”和“六○六”呢？就是因为一个试验了“九一四”次才成功，一个试验了“六○六”次才成功。如果试验的人缺乏坚毅顽强的精神，“九一四”试验到“九一三”次就放弃了，“六○六”试验到“六○五”次就放弃了，那么，这两种药品很可能直到现在还没有创造出来。大科学家居里夫妇，整整用了四年的时间，经过无数次的失败，才把镭发现出来。因此，我们的青年同志要有这样一种精神，凡是可以干又能够干的事情，就要坚决干下去，在干的中间，不断地总结经验，修正错误，不要被任何挫折和失败所动摇，不达目的，决不罢休。
    在伟大的技术革命中，在引导青年做好本职工作的同时，鼓舞和支持广大青年大胆思考和顽强试验的创造精神，是共青团组织的一个很重要的工作。当青年同志在试验和创造中遇到困难和挫折的时候，应该鼓舞他们，给他们加油，而不应该向他们泼冷水。现在我们全国有三万二千多个青年突击队和青年先进班组，我们不但要把这些组织当作突破定额的突击力量，而且要把这些组织当作带头进行试验、推广先进技术的重要基地。我们厂矿团的干部不是问怎样学习技术吗？参加到这些先进班组中去，和他们一起进行试验，这就是学习技术的最好的办法。
    在日常生活中培养勤俭的美德
    为了加速祖国的社会主义建设，我们还要坚决贯彻党中央和毛主席提出的勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业，勤俭持家的指示。克勤克俭，是我们新中国青年有志气、有觉悟的一种表现。
    有些青年人，以为到了社会主义社会就一切都好了，幸福就会像孔雀一样地飞来。当然，这是不对的。毛主席教导我们：社会主义制度的建立给我们开辟了一条达到理想境界的道路，而理想境界的实现，还要靠我们辛勤劳动。我们全国青年职工，都要常常记住这一教导，下定决心，苦战若干年，用自己勤劳的双手，改变我国贫穷落后的面貌，建设幸福的生活。这样做，在目前来说，当然要累一些、苦一些。但是，这正是为了使美好幸福的生活更快地到来，也就是为了给我们的子孙造福。所以我们才心甘情愿地忍受暂时的困难，兴高采烈地去迎接前进道路上的困难，勇敢地去战胜这些困难。
    在最近反浪费反保守运动中，广大青年职工在党的领导下，带头燃起了反浪费的烈火，组织了成千上万个青年突击队，揭发出大量的浪费现象，千方百计地为国家节约了很多财富。事实说明，厂矿企业中节约的潜力是很大的，节约的办法也是很多的，青年职工在这方面是大有可为的。根据各地的经验，我们可以开展下列这些节约活动：
    第一，改进设计，消灭图纸差错。最近，天津铁道部第三设计院的青年工程技术人员，提出了“把浪费消灭在图纸上，不让浪费出门”的战斗口号，经过五次抢救，就为国家节约了二亿八千万元。如果全国每个青年设计人员都来参加这个活动，那将会为我们国家节省多么大的财富。
    第二，消灭废次品，提高产品质量。出废次品就是最大的浪费。现在各地青工在减少废次品，提高质量方面已经做出了成绩。哈尔滨青年磨工王克绪同志，四年多做了近五万件精密细致的产品，没有出一次废品。大连造船厂青年电焊工段全部消灭了废次品。这样的事例越来越多了。我们应该在这个基础上，把不出或者少出废次品的优等质量的活动，更加深入持久地进行下去。
    第三，节省原材料，采用代用品。随着生产的发展，原材料的需要量日益增加。这就要求我们努力节约原材料，广泛采用代用品。北京石景山钢铁厂电力外线李春菁小组，决心在1958年要使节省下来的铁棍能够绕北京转一圈，节省下来的铜线能够绕北京转两圈。常州溥利仁油厂利用稻草先酿酒，后作饲料或者造纸，用米糠先榨油，后酿酒，再作饲料。这说明，我们节约原材料的潜力是很大的，在采用代用品方面有着广阔的前途。
    第四，爱护工具，维护设备。爱护工具，维护设备，努力不出损坏机器、设备的事故，仍然是我们节约活动中的一项重要的任务。沈阳风动工具厂的青工，最近发起修复旧工具的活动，仅修复一千二百多把工具，就为国家节省了一万五千多元。他们这样的作法是值得提倡的。
    第五，充分利用工时，节省辅助时间。速度，是我们和资本主义的竞赛中取得胜利的决定因素。我们不能让生产中的每一分钟时间白白过去，要使每分钟时间都为国家创造出财富。大连造船厂青年车工朱维勤和张连德同志所以能够五年完成九年的任务，其重要原因之一，就因为他们把“不浪费每一分钟生产时间”当作自己的行动口号。
    第六，收集废旧料和利用废旧料。收集废旧料在各地都有很大的成绩，我们要继续开展这方面的活动。目前，更重要的是还要充分地利用这些废旧料。上海青年职工为了向这次大会献礼，就利用废旧料制造了近千台机床和各种产品二十八万余件。这种活动是值得推广的。
    当然，节约的办法并不止这些，例如清理大仓库，打开小仓库，延长工作服使用时间等等，都可以根据具体情况来进行。
    共青团的组织要向青年充分地说明开展节约活动的意义，具体地计算青年节约活动的经济效果，提出一定的奋斗目标，和工会密切配合，共同组织青年去实现。共青团组织还应该在节约活动中加强对青年进行勤俭建国、爱厂如家的教育，使青年都能以共产主义的态度来对待公共财物。
    我们每个青年职工同志，不仅在生产中要做节约的能手，而且在生活上也应该成为一个俭朴的人。最近，江苏省的青年响应团省委的号召，纷纷制订“勤俭节约小计划”，他们要在二年内储蓄一千五百万元。这是一件很有意义的事情，储蓄既可以为国家增加建设资金，又可以帮助我们有计划地安排生活，没有结婚的青年，还能为成家后的需要做必要的储备。如果每个青年职工平均每月储蓄5％的工资，以全国一千万青年职工每人每月平均储蓄二元计算，在第二个五年计划期间，就可以储蓄十二亿元。这笔钱，就能建设三百座五千瓩的火力发电站，或者五百座年产一万吨的化学肥料厂。我们希望全国青年职工热烈地参加储蓄活动。我们要在日常的生活中培养起勤俭的美德。
    发扬团结友爱精神
    为了我们共同的伟大事业，我们工人阶级要进一步加强团结。我们青年工人应该是我国各阶层青年中最有觉悟的部分，也应该成为发扬团结友爱精神的模范。
    现代的工业生产需要紧密的协作。在各个工业部门之间，在厂同厂之间，在车间同车间之间，在工段同工段之间，在上一班同下一班之间，都需要密切的协作。一个部门的生产落后了，就会影响整个生产的向前发展。而当整个生产中的平衡、被某一个先进的单位突破的时候，这又需要先进的单位以共产主义的协作精神，去帮助落后的单位很快地赶上，建立新的平衡。只有这样，才能使我们整个建设事业迅速地、有节奏地向前发展。在这方面，有着许多动人的例子。上海美成电业厂的青年工人，为要使自己的产品质量迅速地赶上英国，决定不要国家投资，提前修建一个真空缸。但是无论在厂房条件和技术上，都遇到了许多困难。消息一传出，就有二十多个单位的青年自动地来积极协助，有的突击帮助设计，有的连夜加班浇铸配件，有的让出了建筑厂房的场地，有的用义务劳动来清理厂房的地基。结果提前完成了修建的任务。石家庄国棉一厂，生产上落后的青工组成了赶先进突击队，由生产上最优秀的青年工人来当队长，结果落后的就迅速地赶上了先进。我们青年工人在生产中，就要像他们这样，发扬相互帮助、相互配合、团结友爱的协作精神。
    在我们青年工人中，也还有一些思想觉悟比较差的，或者是犯了一些错误的同志。对于他们，我们应该给予同志式的关怀。对于我们共产主义者来说，看到自己的同伴，思想上有了毛病，背上了沉重的包袱，走不动路，要掉队了，这是一件非常难受的事情。我们就要伸出手来，帮助他们。我们怎样来帮助他们呢？毛主席教育我们，要从团结的愿望出发，经过批评，在新的基础上达到新的团结。这就是说，对于他们的错误，我们要抱着治病救人的态度，进行严肃的批评；同时我们又要满腔热情地、耐心地帮助他们赶上队伍。我们要相信他们是能够进步的。铁和钢只要一千多度就可以熔化了，我们共产主义者的心的热度，有一万度。难道还不能帮助落后的同伴转化过来吗？
    为共产主义事业贡献一切力量
    在这次会议上，同志们还讲了许多支援农民兄弟的例子。有的为农民制造了各种新式农具、机器、小型拖拉机。有的帮助农业社修理机械，传授技术知识。这些活动都是很好的。农民是我们的亲兄弟。农村是工业品的市场和工业原料的基地。支援农民是我们工人阶级应尽的义务。现在，我国的地方工业，正在大量地发展。地方工业主要是为农业服务的。我们青年工人也要热情支援地方工业的发展，让技术下乡，让机器到处响，让工厂遍城乡。
    工会和共青团都是党联系群众的纽带，都是共产主义的学校。我们的目标是一致的。我们的任务是共同的。在工作中，我们已经建立了亲密的合作。几年来，工会对共青团的工作有很多的支持和帮助。我们共青团的组织也应该更加积极地支持工会的活动。让我们共同努力，把培养和教育青年工人的工作做得更好。
    同志们，我的话就要结束了。我在上面已经讲到，人是我们伟大事业的决定因素。我们是什么样的人呢？我们是毛泽东时代的人，是毛泽东时代的青年人。我们的党和革命前辈，已经为我们创造了一个崭新的天地，已经为我们开辟了一条通向共产主义的光明大道。现在，我们就应该充分发挥我们的能动性，作祖国需要我们做的事，做我们前人从来没有做过的事。
    我们的这次会议，是一个长志气的会议。会议期间，我们参观了上海工人运动的革命史迹，听了老一辈工人向我们介绍的可歌可泣的革命经历，使我们受到了一次极其深刻的教育。我们应该继承老一辈的革命精神，立下这样一个宏伟的志气：一定要在党的领导下，同全国人民一起，把我们的祖国，建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
    我们的这次会议，又是一个长本领的会议。经过整风运动，我们的觉悟提高了，我们的革命干劲更足了。但是，我们决不自满，我们一定要继续加强自己，充实自己，提高自己。我们应该不辜负党中央和毛主席对我们的期望，一定要迅速地把自己培养成为有觉悟、有组织、有纪律和有文化科学技术的工人阶级的战士。
    我们的这次会议，又是一个相互学习的会议。在会议中，大家交流了经验，并且参观了我们祖国这个最大的工业城市。上海的党和政府给了我们很大的帮助。上海的工人阶级，给了我们大会以热情的关怀和支持。上海人民的蓬勃的革命热情，给了我们很大的鼓舞。我们一定要把在上海看到的和学到的一切好东西，带回到各自的岗位上去，让它在全国各地开花结果。
    我们的这次会议，还是一个总动员的会议。我们应该把党中央和毛主席对我们的希望，把这次会议所介绍的先进经验，把会议所通过的倡议和决定，一句话，就是要把我们这次会议所表达的共同意志，变成为全国一千万青年职工的实际行动。
    同志们，让我们更紧密的团结起来，在我们伟大的党和毛主席的领导下，为祖国，为人民，为共产主义事业，贡献出我们的一切力量。
