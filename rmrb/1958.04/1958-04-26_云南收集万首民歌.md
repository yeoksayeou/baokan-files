Xinhua News Agency, Kunming Electric Dispatch: The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and more than ten counties in Yunnan Province, including Jinning, Mojiang, and Yuxi, have collected nearly 10,000 folk songs.

These folk songs include reed-pipe tunes, Dabanqiang, Sanxian tunes (Zanha tunes), long poems, and drinking songs from more than ten ethnic groups, including the Dai and Hani. During the Great Leap Forward in production, people improvised, adding new lyrics to existing tunes, singing while working, and singing about the happy prospects and the heroic spirit of the people.

	On the construction site of reservoirs, stonemasons worked hard all night, and people sang: "Digging ditches encounters steep rocky cliffs, we work hard in the middle of the night, the stonemason brothers roar three times, and the steep cliffs lower themselves." The tampers sang: "Tamping early and tamping late, tamping the earth tightly to build walls, stone tampers build dams, and sweat exchanges for clear water ponds."

	The Dai women in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture originally did not know how to plow the fields. During this year's large-scale water conservancy construction, there were fewer people plowing than last year. At this time, a Dai woman named Yu Yingyang in Mengzhe, Xishuangbanna, broke through numerous constraints and superstitions and was the first to learn to plow the fields. Dai folk singers turned her deeds into Zanha tunes and sang them everywhere. Women were greatly encouraged, and a wave of women learning to plow the fields appeared in twelve Banna.

	Since the Propaganda Department of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice in early April, many areas have sent the collected folk songs and ballads to the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee. The Propaganda Department has established a special editing organization to sort out and select the songs. The Yunnan Provincial Bureau of Culture has notified more than 5,000 rural clubs in the province to collect folk songs. The Yunnan People's Publishing House is compiling and printing three collections of folk songs.

    云南收集万首民歌
    新华社昆明电　云南省西双版纳傣族自治州和晋宁、墨江、玉溪等十多县已经收集到近万首民歌。
    这些民歌包括傣族、哈尼族等十多个民族的芦笙调、大板腔、三弦调（赞哈调）和长诗、酒歌等。在生产大跃进中，人们即兴创作，为原已流传的曲子配上了新词，一边劳动一边歌唱，歌唱幸福的远景和人民的英雄气概。
    在水库工地上，石匠们彻夜苦战，人们唱道：“挖沟遇着陡石岩，半夜三更干起来，石匠大哥吼三声，悬岩陡壁低下来。”打夯的民工们唱道：“早打夯来晚打夯，打紧土方筑成墙，石夯打成拦河坝，汗水换得清水塘。”
    西双版纳傣族自治州的傣族妇女原来不会犁田。今年大修水利中，犁田人手比去年少，这时候版纳勐遮一个叫玉应养的傣族妇女冲破重重束缚和迷信，第一个学会了犁田。傣族民间歌手们把她的事迹编成赞哈调到处演唱，妇女们受到很大鼓舞，十二个版纳都出现了妇女学犁田的热潮。
    从4月初中共云南省委宣传部发出通知以后，许多地区把搜集到的民歌民谣送到省委宣传部。宣传部成立了专门的编辑机构，进行整理选择工作。云南省文化局已通知全省五千多个农村俱乐部收集民歌。云南人民出版社正在编印三本民歌集。
