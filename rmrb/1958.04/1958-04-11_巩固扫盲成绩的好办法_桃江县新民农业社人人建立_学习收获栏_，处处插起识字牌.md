Xinhua News Agency report: Taojiang County, Hunan Province, has found a way to consolidate literacy achievements in Xinmin Agricultural Cooperative. The farmers in this cooperative can now basically learn a character and remember it. Their method is: everyone establishes "Learning Harvest Columns," literacy signs are erected everywhere, books are always in hand, and characters are always in sight. They study at night and review during the day.

Last November, the four literacy schools in the cooperative conducted an exam and found that the learning relapse rate reached 56%. The masses reflected: "We learn at night and forget during the day, we can't learn anything in our whole lives." The number of people attending literacy schools dropped from more than ninety to only thirty. The Party branch of the cooperative studied this situation and mobilized everyone to come up with solutions to consolidate learning achievements and eliminate relapse. Communist Youth League members Zhao Shibao, Wu Guqing, and others wrote the new characters they learned every night on the walls of their homes with chalk. They could remember ten new characters every day. Their homes were filled with writing everywhere, and their learning enthusiasm remained high.

They call this method "Learning Harvest Columns," and every household in the cooperative has established "Learning Harvest Columns." There are many stone slabs on the mountains here, and the cooperative used stone slabs to make more than 130 field literacy signs. Whatever work they do, the teacher writes the corresponding characters on the signs. When they finish work, they spend a few minutes in the fields to assess work points. They record what work they did and how many work points they earned in their labor manuals according to the farm work written on the construction site literacy signs. They only need to have the work recorder stamp it. This not only helps them recognize new characters, but also reduces the trouble of assessing work points and recording them at night, ensuring that there is time to study every night. By adopting the above methods, this cooperative has basically eliminated the phenomenon of learning relapse. In just over four months, the illiterate people in the cooperative can generally recognize about 1,000 characters. During the busy spring plowing season, they persisted in studying culture.

    巩固扫盲成绩的好办法
    桃江县新民农业社人人建立“学习收获栏”，处处插起识字牌
    据新华社讯　湖南桃江县新民农业社找到了巩固扫盲成绩的办法。这个社的农民现在基本上做到学一个字，记住一个字。他们的办法是：人人建立“学习收获栏”，到处插起识字牌，书不离手，字不离目。晚上学习，白天复习。
    去年11月间，社里四所民校进行一次考试，发现学习回生率达56％。群众反映：晚上学，白天忘，一辈子也学不进去。上民校的人数由九十多人下降到只剩下三十多名。社里中共党支部研究了这个情况，发动大家想办法，巩固学习成绩，消灭回生现象。共青团员赵石保、吴谷清等把每晚学的生字，用粉笔写在家里墙壁上，每天能记十个生字，家里到处写的满满的，学习情绪始终饱满。
    他们把这种办法称作“学习收获栏”，全社家家户户都建立了“学习收获栏”。这里山上石板多，社里利用石板做了一百三十多块田间识字牌。干什么活，老师就在上面写上什么字样。他们收工时，用几分钟在田间评定工分，自己按照工地识字牌上写的农活，在劳动手册上记上干什么活，评多少工，只交给记工员盖章就行了。既认识了生字，又减少了晚上评工记分的麻烦，保证每晚可以有时间学习。这个社通过采取上述办法，基本上消灭了学习回生现象。仅仅经过四个多月，全社文盲一般能认识一千字左右，在春耕大忙季节，他们都坚持了学习文化。
