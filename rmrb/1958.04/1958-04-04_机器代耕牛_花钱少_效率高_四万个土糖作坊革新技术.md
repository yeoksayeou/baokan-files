    Machines Replace Oxen in Plowing: Less Cost, Higher Efficiency
    40,000 Native Sugar Workshops Adopt Technological Innovation
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 2nd. Approximately 40,000 sugarcane native sugar workshops across the country will undergo technological reforms, and sugar production will therefore greatly increase. The large number of oxen originally used in native sugar workshops will be freed up to support agricultural production. This measure was proposed at the Eleven Province Small-Scale Press Pilot Observation and Sugarcane Native Sugar Production Technology Experience Exchange Conference, which concluded on March 31st.
    Replacing the labor of oxen in native sugar workshops will be a small press. This type of press can process fifteen tons of sugarcane per day, producing 2.15 tons of sugar, which is much more efficient than the current native sugar workshops, which can only squeeze five tons of sugarcane and produce 0.55 tons of sugar per day using more than a dozen head of cattle. This small press costs little and yields quick results. A machine, including power, only costs about 4,000 to 7,000 yuan, and the entire investment can be recovered in about ten days after it is put into production. This machine is small, lightweight, and suitable for going up mountains and down to the countryside. The operating technology is simple and can be learned in a short time. During the off-season, its power can also be used for milling flour and pressing oil.
    The representatives attending the meeting observed the performance of this small press and were very interested in it. Representatives from various regions initially proposed commissioning Guangdong to manufacture 1,200 units. In addition, various provinces will also manufacture them themselves.
    This conference was hosted by the Ministry of Light Industry in Guangzhou.

### 机器代耕牛　花钱少　效率高  四万个土糖作坊革新技术

    机器代耕牛　花钱少　效率高
    四万个土糖作坊革新技术
    据新华社广州2日电　全国约四万个甘蔗土糖作坊将要进行技术改革，糖的产量因此将要大大增加。土糖作坊原来使用的大量耕牛将抽出来支援农业生产。这一措施是3月31日结束的十一省小型压榨机试点观摩及甘蔗土糖生产技术经验交流会议上提出来的。
    代替土糖作坊耕牛劳动的将是一种小压榨机。这种压榨机每天可以处理十五吨甘蔗，出糖二点一五吨，比现在土糖作坊用十几头大牛每天只能榨蔗五吨、产糖零点五五吨的效率高得多。这种小型压榨机花钱不多，收效快。一台机器连动力在内，大约只需四千到七千元，投入生产后十天左右就可以收回全部投资。这种机器小巧轻便，适宜上山下乡，操作技术简单，可以在短时间内学会。停榨期间，还可以利用它的动力磨粉、榨油。
    到会代表观摩了这种小压榨机表演，对它很感兴趣。各地代表初步提出委托广东制造一千二百台。此外，各省还将自行制造。
    这次会议是由轻工业部主持在广州召开的。
