    Peasants Love Big-Character Posters
    Since the rectification campaign, in the 317 villages of Xingtang County, Hebei, big-character posters have become very popular in 234 villages. These villages have 891 big-character poster areas.
    During the rectification campaign, the masses used big-character posters to help village and commune cadres improve their work style, which brought the cadres and the masses closer together. For example, the director, accountant, secretary, and two other subsidized cadres of the Lianjiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative used to do nothing but discuss problems, draw forms, and calculate numbers in the office, or sit around the radio listening to operas, failing to delve into leading production. Some commune members had criticized them, but they did not change. This time, the commune members put up a big-character poster with a cartoon, titled "The Joy of Five." In the upper right corner of the cartoon, there were five people in the cooperative's office, happily ordering operas on the radio, one saying, "Listen to Beijing opera," another saying, "Listen to Ping opera," and yet another requesting a bit of "Hebei Bangzi." In contrast to this scene, the lower right corner depicted commune members toiling in the fields with heavy hoes, sweating profusely. They were talking about accumulating manure, delivering fertilizer, digging wells, dredging ditches, and building reservoirs. This cartoon greatly shocked the cadres, and after seeing it, they immediately put up a big-character poster to make a self-criticism. The next morning, the five cadres went to work in the fields with the commune members. The radio was also moved to the fields for everyone to listen to news, music, and weather forecasts during breaks. The commune members happily said, "The Joy of Five" has become "The Joy of All."
    The widespread appearance of big-character posters in the rural areas of Xingtang has made the democratic life in the countryside more active. Many people have said that after reading the big-character posters, their minds have been enlightened. If they don't go to see them for a day, it's like not having eaten. Wherever big-character posters are posted, people are watching them in the morning and evening. Some illiterate people ask literate people to read them aloud. Some commune members who work in the fields during the day also light lamps to read the big-character posters at night. Writing and reading big-character posters has become a habit of the masses.
    In Aoli Village, a big-character poster improved the relationship of a family from bad to good. Zhang Wuyong and his wife in this village were not filial to the elderly, and although the villagers had advised them, they did not change. Later, commune member Zhang Luohuai put up a big-character poster criticizing him for being "ungrateful," and Zhang Wuyong and his wife finally changed. His old mother happily said to everyone, "The big-character poster gave me a good son." A strained family is now living a life of happy labor and a cheerful mood.

    农民喜爱大字报
    河北行唐县三百一十七个村庄，自整风以来有二百三十四个村大字报非常盛行。这些村庄设有大字报园地八百九十一处。
    整风当中，群众运用大字报帮助村、社干部改进了工作作风，于是干部和群众的联系更密切了。如廉家庄农业社社长、会计、秘书等五个受补贴的干部，过去除了在办公室里讨论问题、画表格、算数字，就是围着收音机听戏，不深入领导生产。曾有社员批评过，但他们未改。这次，社员们贴出了一张画着漫画的大字报，标题是“五人乐”。漫画的右上角画着：在合作社的办公室里，有五个人围着收音机正得意的点戏，这个说：“听京剧”，那个说：“听评剧”，还有的要求来段“河北梆子”。和这个场面相对照，右下角画的是社员们正抡着大镐在田里劳动，累得满头大汗。他们谈论的是积肥、送粪、打井、挖渠、修水库。这张漫画，对干部们震动很大，他们看了以后，马上贴出大字报作了检讨。第二天早晨，五个干部便和社员们一起下地劳动了。收音机也搬到地里去，供大家休息时听新闻、音乐和天气预报。社员们高兴地说：“五人乐”变成“大家乐”了。
    大字报在行唐农村普遍出现，使得农村的民主生活更加活跃了。很多群众反映：看了大字报，脑子开了窍。一天不去看，好比没吃饭。凡是张贴大字报的地方，早晚都有人看。有些不识字的人，就请识字的给他们念。有些白天下地生产的社员，晚上也要掌灯看大字报。写大字报和看大字报，已成为群众的习惯。
    在凹里村曾出现一张大字报把一个家庭的关系由坏变好了。这村张五永夫妇不孝顺老人，乡亲们劝过他们，不改。后来，社员张洛槐给他贴出了一张大字报，批评他“无义”，张五永夫妇才转变了。他的老妈妈见人就高兴地说：“大字报给了我个好儿子。”一个别扭人家，现在过着劳动愉快，心情舒畅的日子了。
