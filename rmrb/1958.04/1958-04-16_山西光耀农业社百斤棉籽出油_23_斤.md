Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Guangyao Agricultural Cooperative oil mill in Fuce Village, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, has created the highest national record for oil extraction rate from cottonseed using wooden presses. They extracted 23 jin of oil from every 100 jin of cottonseed containing 24.46 jin of oil. This achievement was obtained by the oil mill workers conscientiously promoting Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil pressing experience, improving tools, and ensuring that the temperature and moisture were suitable for pressing.

The Ministry of Food recently held an on-site meeting in this cooperative with representatives from six provinces, including Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, and Shanxi, to observe and learn the oil pressing operation procedures.
