"The Blue Qinggang Forest"
This is the third part of Lei Jia's "Potential Trilogy," following "Spring Comes to the Yalu River" and "Standing at the Forefront." The novel depicts the factory protection struggle waged by workers of a paper mill in a certain city against the Kuomintang's large-scale offensive against Northeast China in the early days of liberation, as well as their efforts in recovery and construction after the victory, overcoming various difficulties. The novel portrays the complex and magnificent life scenes of that time in all aspects, and shapes some unforgettable images of advanced elements of the working class. Their strong will and courage to overcome difficulties can inspire readers.

    “蓝色的青棡林”
    这是雷加继“春天来到了鸭绿江”、“站在最前列”之后，所写的“潜力三部曲”的第三部。小说描写了解放初期国民党向东北大举进攻时，某市造纸厂工人对敌展开护厂斗争以及胜利以后，他们克服了种种困难，从事恢复与建设的情况。小说描绘了当时各方面复杂而壮阔的生活情景，塑造了一些令人难忘的工人阶级的先进分子的形象，他们坚强的意志和勇于克服困难的精神，都能够激励读者。
