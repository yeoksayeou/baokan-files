The Will of the German People
By Our Newspaper Commentator

On April 16, Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic delivered a government statement in the People's Chamber. The statement supported the Soviet proposal that representatives from the two Germanys participate in a summit meeting to discuss the German peace treaty issue, and reiterated that the two Germanys should hold negotiations on the establishment of a confederation. The statement condemned the atomic armament resolution passed by the Bonn Bundestag, and called on all German people to take all measures to oppose West German atomic armament and strive for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe and the formation of a confederation of the two Germanys. The government statement of the German Democratic Republic expressed the will of the German people to eliminate the threat of atomic war, safeguard peace in Europe, and promote the reunification of Germany. Therefore, it will not only be welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world, but will also strongly encourage the West German people to rise up more widely against the West German atomic armament policy.

The government statement of the German Democratic Republic forms a sharp contrast with the recent foreign policy debate in the West German Bundestag. At that time, the West German government, relying on its majority in the parliament, flagrantly disregarded the strong protests of the German people and passed a resolution to equip the West German army with atomic weapons. Not only that, in order to accelerate the implementation of the conspiracy of the United States and the West German government to jointly undermine the East-West summit, the West German Bundestag also approved the Adenauer government's purchase of American missiles that can launch nuclear warheads. At the recent meeting of NATO defense ministers in Paris, it was decided to expand the West German army, doubling the number of NATO troops on the East-West German border. These sinister activities jointly planned by the West German government and the United States can only intensify international tensions, deepen the division of Germany, and create new threats of war.

Therefore, all these conspiracy plans of the West German government have been strongly condemned and protested by the entire German people and world public opinion. A movement against atomic death on an unprecedented scale has been launched by broad sections of the West German population. Workers, peasants, youth, women, churches, and many prominent political leaders in West Germany have expressed their firm will to oppose atomic armament policies through practical actions such as marches, demonstrations, protest strikes, and mass rallies. In the face of this wave of popular protest, many city councils in West Germany decided to hold referendums on the issue of atomic armament. However, the Adenauer government, using the excuse that referendums "violate the constitution," attempted to stifle the people's right to freely express their will.

This approach of the Adenauer government thoroughly exposes it as an enemy of the German national interest. On the other hand, the German Democratic Republic has consistently and resolutely safeguarded the national interests of Germany, and has made unremitting efforts for European peace and the reunification of Germany. The statement of the German Democratic Republic once again proves this point.

The stark contrast profoundly educates the German people. Now, the Adenauer group, due to its anti-people policies, is becoming increasingly isolated among the German people; the policies pursued by the German Democratic Republic, which are in line with the interests of the German people, are increasingly gaining the support of the German people. We, the Chinese people, warmly support the proposals of the German Democratic Republic, and firmly believe that the wishes of the German people will be realized.

    德国人民的意志
    本报评论员
    4月16日，德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在人民议院发表了政府声明。声明支持苏联关于由两个德国派代表参加最高级会议讨论对德和约问题的建议，并重申两个德国就建立邦联问题举行谈判；声明指责了波恩联邦议院所通过的原子武装决议，同时号召全德人民采取一切办法反对西德原子武装，争取建立欧洲无原子武器区和两个德国成立邦联。德意志民主共和国的政府声明表达了德国人民要求消除原子战争威胁、维护欧洲和平以及促进德国的重新统一的意志。因而，它不仅将受到世界爱好和平人民的欢迎，并且也将有力地鼓舞西德人民更加广泛地起来反对西德原子武装政策。
    德意志民主共和国的政府声明和不久前西德联邦议院的外交辩论形成了鲜明的对照。当时西德政府挟着它在议院中多数，悍然不顾德国人民的强烈抗议，通过了一项以原子武器装备西德军队的决议。不仅如此，为了加速实施美国和西德政府共同破坏东西方最高级会议的阴谋，西德联邦议院又批准阿登纳政府购买可以发射核弹头的美国导弹。最近在巴黎召开的北大西洋集团国防部长会议上，又决定扩充西德军队，要使东西德边界上的北大西洋集团军队增加一倍。西德政府和美国勾结一起共同策划的这些罪恶活动，只能加剧国际紧张局势，加深德国的分裂，并造成新的战争威胁。
    因此，西德政府的这一切阴谋计划遭到了全德国人民以及世界公众舆论的强烈谴责和抗议。西德广大阶层人士掀起了一个空前规模的反对原子死亡的运动。西德的工人、农民、青年、妇女、教会以及许多著名的政治领袖都纷纷以游行示威、抗议罢工、群众大会的实际行动来表示他们反对原子武装政策的坚决意志。在人民这种抗议浪潮面前，西德许多市议会决定就原子武装问题举行公民投票。但是阿登纳政府竟然以公民投票“违反宪法”为借口，企图扼杀人民自由表示意志的权利。
    阿登纳政府的这种做法彻底暴露了它是德国民族利益的敌人。另一方面，德意志民主共和国一贯坚决地维护德国的民族利益，为欧洲的和平、德国的重新统一进行不懈的努力。德意志民主共和国的声明，再一次证明了这一点。
    鲜明的对比，深刻地教育了德国人民。现在阿登纳集团由于它所执行的反人民的政策正使它在德国人民中越来越孤立；德意志民主共和国，所奉行的符合德国人民利益的政策越来越获得德国人民的支持。我们中国人民热烈支持德意志民主共和国的主张，并且深信德国人民的愿望必能实现。
