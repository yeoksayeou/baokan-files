Wuzhong Hui Autonomous Prefecture is actively promoting the planting of various improved varieties in technological reforms among Hui and Han farmers. Of the more than 160,000 mu of spring wheat that have already been sown in the Pingchuan area of the autonomous prefecture, all have achieved full coverage of improved varieties. The area of improved varieties in the hundreds of thousands of mu of wheat currently being sown in the mountainous areas is also planned to reach over 80%. The Hui and Han people in the fertile Yellow River plain of the autonomous prefecture have traditionally relied on rice as their main crop, but the native rice varieties planted in the past did not produce high yields. Now, after several years of trial planting by Hui and Han farmers, they are preparing to promote the large-scale planting of more than 80,000 mu of improved rice varieties such as Guoguang and Jingzu No. 107, accounting for nearly half of the rice planting area. In the Wuzhong City Dongtasi Agricultural Cooperative and the Jinji County Xiakou Township First Agricultural Cooperative, jointly formed by Hui and Han farmers, the highest yields of Youshidun improved wheat and Golden Queen corn, which Hui and Han cooperative members taught and learned from each other to trial plant last year, reached over 1,000 jin, more than double the local average yield. Therefore, these improved varieties are also welcomed by the cooperative members this year.

    吴忠回族自治州大面积推广良种
    本报讯　吴忠回族自治州回汉族农民在技术改革中，积极推广种植各种优良品种。在自治州平川地区已经播种的十六万多亩春小麦，已全部达到良种普及化，山区正在播种的数十万亩小麦，良种面积也计划达到80％以上。自治州肥沃的黄河平原上回汉族历来就以种植水稻为主要的农作物，但是过去种植的土种水稻，产量不高。现在回汉族农民经过过去几年来的试种，今年正在准备大面积推广种植国光、经祖107号等优良品种水稻八万多亩，占水稻播种面积的将近一半。在回汉族农民联合组成的吴忠市东塔寺农业社、金积县峡口乡第一农业社，去年回汉族社员互教互学试种的幼士顿良种小麦和金皇后玉米，最高产量都达到一千斤以上，高出当地一般产量的一倍。因此今年这些良种也都受到社员们的欢迎。
