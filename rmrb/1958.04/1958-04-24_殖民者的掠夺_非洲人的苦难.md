    Colonialists' Plunder, Africans' Suffering
    ★ From June 1956 to June 1957, in one year, the "South African United Gold Mines," mainly controlled by British capital, produced 16 million taels of gold, making a profit of 54 million pounds.
    ★ American monopoly capital plunders a large amount of iron ore from Liberia every year, paying the local government only five cents per ton.
    ★ The "United Africa Company," rampant in West Africa, sells European imported goods at 500% of the original price, and the purchase price of local products is only one-third of the world market price.
    ★ In Southern Rhodesia, less than 7% of the population, the Europeans, occupy 54% of the land. Half of the arable land in Kenya is owned by Europeans, and five million Kenyans are forced to concentrate in the barren "reserves" that account for only one-fifth of the total area.
    ★ The highest wage for black African workers is 20 francs per hour, and the lowest is 5.2 francs, while a kilogram of flour costs 213 francs, and the rent for a grass hut is 1,000 francs per month. White workers doing the same work are paid dozens of times more than black workers.
    ★ According to very incomplete statistics, in the past year alone, 1.5 million Africans died of malaria. The mortality rate from other diseases is also extremely high. To this day, all insurance companies refuse to provide life insurance for black people.
    ★ In Kenya, 85% of children do not live to be fifteen years old. In Niger Province, Nigeria, 21% of children die within one year, and 51% do not live to be five years old.
    ★ In French West Africa, Islamic universities appeared eight hundred years ago. The result of centuries of colonial rule is that by 1957 there was not a single university left.
    ★ There is only one doctor for every 1.3 million residents in Nigeria, and one doctor for every 1.5 million residents in Transvaal.
    ★ In British African colonies, there is an average of one doctor for every 16,000 people, while in Britain there is one doctor for every 1,000 people.
    ★ According to French statistics, in the less than sixty years from 1900 to the present, the population of French Equatorial Africa has decreased from 16 million to 4.5 million due to the cruel exploitation of the colonialists. (Attached picture)

    殖民者的掠夺·非洲人的苦难
    ★自1956年6月到1957年6月一年中，主要由英国资本控制的“南非统一金矿”共产黄金一千六百万啢，获利五千四百万镑。
    ★美国垄断资本每年从利比里亚掠夺了大批铁矿砂，只付给当地政府每吨五分美金的代价。
    ★在西非横行的“非洲联合公司”出售的欧洲进口货的价格等于原价的500％，收购的当地土产价格，仅等于世界市场价格的三分之一。
    ★在南罗得西亚，人口不到7％的欧洲人占有了54％的土地。怯尼亚一半可耕地为欧洲人所有，五百万怯尼亚人被迫集中在只占全境五分之一的贫瘠的“居留地”中。
    ★黑非洲工人最高工资是每小时二十法郎，最低五点二法郎，而一公斤面粉价格却是二百一十三法郎，草房一席之地的租金每月也需一千法郎。做同样工作的白种工人工资却高出黑人工资几十倍。
    ★据很不完全的统计，过去一年仅死于疟疾的非洲人就有一百五十万人。其它疾病死亡率也极高。直到今天，所有保险公司都拒绝替黑人保人寿险。
    ★在怯尼亚，85％的儿童活不到十五周岁。在尼日利亚的尼日尔省，21％的儿童在一周岁以内就死了，51％的儿童没有活到五周岁就死了。
    ★在法属西非，八百年前即出现过伊斯兰教大学。殖民主义者统治几个世纪的结果是，到1957年连一所大学也没有了。
    ★在尼日利亚一百三十万居民里面才有一个医生，在德兰斯瓦尔，一百五十万人里面才有一个医生。
    ★在英属非洲殖民地中，平均每一万六千人才有一个医生，而在英国则是每一千人就有一个医生。
    ★据法国统计材料，从1900年到现在的不足六十年中，法属赤道非洲人口由于殖民主义者的残酷剥削，由一千六百万减到四百五十万人。（附图片）
