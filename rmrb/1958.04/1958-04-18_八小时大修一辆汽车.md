    Employees of the Automotive Repair Shop of the First Engineering Bureau of the Highway General Administration of the Ministry of Communications overhauled a car in seven hours and fifty-nine minutes, creating a new record for automobile overhauls. The method was to boldly change the labor organization, from the previous "professional division of labor, assembly line operation" to "working side-by-side, cross-operation, mutual cooperation." They reorganized the labor force, changing the past practice of excessively detailed division of labor to "piece-rate contracting, self-disassembly and self-cleaning, self-assembly, self-inspection." Other inspectors and dispatchers also worked on-site with the shifts. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    八小时大修一辆汽车
    交通部公路总局第一工程局汽车修理厂职工，在七小时又五十九分钟内大修好一辆汽车，创造了汽车大修新纪录。办法是大胆改变劳动组合，由以往的“专业分工、流水作业”，改为“齐头并进、交叉作业、互相协作”，重新组织了劳动力，把过去分工过细的办法改为“分件包干、自拆自洗、自装、自检”。其他检验员、调度员也都在现场随班工作。　（据新华社讯）
