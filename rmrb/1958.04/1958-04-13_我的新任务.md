    My New Task
    Xiao Dong
    The day after our courtyard finished planting trees, we suddenly heard Aunt Zhang shout, "Children, come to a meeting!" This was very new. We only saw adults having meetings, never heard of having meetings for children. We, a group of kids playing in the dirt, all ran towards Aunt Zhang who was calling us, and we all squatted down by the wall. At this time, Aunt Zhang pointed to the newly planted trees in the yard and asked us if they looked good. To be honest, they looked like dry firewood sticks, not good at all, and they even got in the way of us playing in the yard. I remember we planted trees here once before, two years ago, and we pulled them all out long ago. Then, Aunt Zhang told us: these trees cost the country a lot of money, and the uncles put a lot of effort into cultivating them. In the future, when these trees grow up, there will be flowers to see, fruits to eat, and everyone can enjoy the shade under the trees... When we heard this, we thought it was very interesting, and we also liked these bare trees. Aunt Zhang also said: "If you want these trees to grow well, you have to be careful not to touch them or step on them, and someone has to water them often. Children, your parents are very busy with work, and sometimes they don't come home until very late, and they can't take care of watering them often. Are you willing to water these trees?!" When we heard this, we were all very happy and said, "Yes, we are willing."
    Aunt Zhang organized us more than ten children into four small teams. I - Xiao Dong, is the deputy leader of the fourth team. The team members include Xiao Yi, who is four and a half years old, Pang Ya, who is five years old, and the captain is Xiao Rong, who is half a year older than me and is a first-grade elementary school student. After Aunt Zhang finished the meeting with us, everyone rushed to pick up some broken bricks to build a low wall around the trees, and also watered them some water.
    Now, we water and cultivate these trees every day. Yesterday, Aunt Zhang had another meeting with us, and she praised us for doing a good job! Xiao Kun said: "Xiao Mao was grabbing the soil at the roots of the tree, I led him away so that the roots wouldn't be damaged by the wind!" Xiao Hua said: "My little brother wanted to peel the bark of the tree, I took him home." Only one tree in the third team had a branch broken off by Da Hua while playing hide-and-seek. Although everyone forgave him, he was still very sad. We also stipulated that we should not play hide-and-seek in places with trees. Finally, Aunt Zhang also told us a story about a small poplar tree.
    Our trees are now growing buds as big as rice grains, and it looks like they are about to grow up and bloom. My mother also told me: After many years, some of these trees can be used to make train carriages, electric poles, and maybe even something on a spaceship to fly to the moon and Mars!

    我的新任务
    小东
    我们院里种完树的第二天，忽然听见张阿姨喊：“小朋友们都来开会！”这事很新鲜，只看见大人开会，从来没听说给小孩开会。我们一伙正在挖土玩的孩子，就都向招呼我们的张阿姨跑去，大家一齐蹲在墙根下。这时候，张阿姨指着院子里新栽的一圈树问我们好不好看。说真的，像干柴棍一样，一点也不好看，还碍着我们在院子里玩。记得前年这里也栽过一回树，我们可早就把它拔光了。接着，张阿姨又给我们讲：这些树是国家费多少钱，叔叔们费多少事培植出来的。将来这些树长大了，有花可看，有果子可吃，大伙儿还能在树荫下乘凉……我们一听，觉得挺有意思，也喜欢这些光杆子树了。张阿姨又说：“要这些树好好长大，就要当心不要碰了它、踩了它，还要有人常常给它们浇水。小朋友们，你们的爸爸妈妈工作都很忙，有时候晚上很晚才回家，也顾不得常常来浇水。你们是不是愿意来给这些树浇水呀？！”我们一听，都非常高兴地说：“愿意，愿意。”
    张阿姨给我们十几个孩子编成了四个小队。我——小东，是第四小队的副队长。队员有四岁半的小义，五岁的胖丫，正队长是小容，她比我大半岁，是一年级小学生。张阿姨同我们开完了会，大家都七手八脚地去捡了些碎砖头，给树的周围垒上一堵矮墙，还浇了一些水。
    现在，我们每天都给这些树浇浇水，培培土。昨天，张阿姨又同我们开了一个会，她夸我们作得好哩！小昆说：“小毛抓树根的土，我把他领开了，不叫树根给风吹坏啦！”小华说：“小弟弟要剥树皮，我把他抱回家去了。”只有第三小队的一棵树，被大华捉迷藏时碰断了一根树枝。虽然大家原谅了他，可是他还是很难过。我们又规定捉迷藏不要在有树的地方。末了，张阿姨还给我们讲了一个小杨树的故事。
    我们的树，现在都长出了米粒大的芽苞，眼看它就要长大开花了。妈妈还告诉我：过好多年后，这些树有的还可以作火车的车厢，可以作电线杆，说不定还要作宇宙飞船上的什么东西飞到月亮和火星上去呢！
