Guiyang Dispatch: The Guiyang Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China is organizing all leading cadres in the city to personally summarize advanced experiences. Over the past month, thirty-eight people have written thirty-six articles that have significantly promoted practical work.

At the end of February, in order to improve leadership thinking, improve leadership methods, and adapt to the new situation of the current all-round great leap forward, the Municipal Party Committee decided to organize all Municipal Party Committee members, alternate members, ministers of the Municipal Party Committee, secretaries of district committees, and directors of the Municipal People's Committee bureaus to summarize an advanced experience each in a relatively short period; it also decided that each responsible cadre should summarize three to five advanced experiences this year to promote the leap forward in all aspects of the city's work.

After the Guiyang Municipal Party Committee's decision was issued, a wave of summarizing advanced experiences was set off among the city's leading cadres. By the first half of April, thirty-eight people had completed thirty-six articles. These articles not only vividly praised the advanced figures and advanced initiatives on various fronts, but also summarized the specific advanced experiences in various aspects. Wu Jiamo, the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, summarized five experiences of universal significance for the trial production of new products through the successful trial production of gas generators by the Guiyang Power Machinery Factory. In terms of organizing voluntary labor for afforestation, Zhao Keqiang, the Mayor of Guiyang, also summarized some specific practices. Jin Ziming, the Secretary of the Yunyan District Committee of the Communist Party of China, summarized the experience of promoting the Four Pests Elimination Campaign using the method of large-scale debate.

These experiences are very instructive for the work of relevant departments in Guiyang City. After Wu Jiamo summarized the experience that "opposing conservatism is the prerequisite for the trial production of new products" in early March and promoted it, a high tide of trial production of new products was set off in various factories and mines throughout the city. By early April, more than 340 new products such as universal tractors, automatic dump trucks, and electric motors had been trial-produced. Guiyang City has been promoting the experience of "measuring cloth for sale" and "tailoring" summarized by Tong Renqing, Deputy Director of the Commercial Bureau, since April 1. Each uniform saves an average of nine inches of cotton cloth compared with the old tailoring method. If calculated on the basis of one set of clothing per person per year in the city, 540,000 feet of cotton cloth can be saved. In mid-March, the person in charge of the Municipal Culture Bureau summarized the experience of Fushui District in popularizing the mass cultural network throughout the district in five and a half days, and after it was promoted throughout the city, clubs have now been established in various factories, mines, streets, and agricultural cooperatives, and the task of popularizing the mass cultural network has been basically completed.

In this process of summarizing advanced experiences, all leading cadres have gone deep into the grassroots, deep into the masses, personally conducted investigations and research, and personally wrote summaries, changing the previous practice of sitting in the office listening to reports and asking secretaries to draft. After many leading cadres personally came into contact with advanced things and personally saw the endless wisdom and potential of the masses, they further strengthened their confidence and determination to leap forward.

    贵阳市委组织全市领导干部
    总结经验　写出文章
    改变光听汇报和依赖秘书的作法
    本报贵阳20日电　中共贵阳市委组织全市领导干部人人动手总结先进经验。一个多月来，全市有三十八人写出三十六篇对实际工作有重要推动作用的文章。
    2月底，市委为了提高领导思想，改进领导方法，适应当前全面大跃进的新形势，决定组织全体市委委员、候补委员、市委各部长、各区区委书记、市人民委员会各局局长，在较短期内每人总结一项先进经验；并决定每个负责干部今年要总结三到五项先进经验，来推动全市各项工作向前跃进。
    贵阳市委的决定下达以后，在全市的领导干部中掀起了一个总结先进经验的热潮。到4月上半月止，已有三十八人完成三十六篇文章。这些文章不仅生动地表彰了各个战线上的先进人物和先进创举，而且总结了各方面先进的具体经验。市委第一书记伍嘉谟通过贵阳动力机器厂试制煤气机成功一事，总结出五条对试制新产品有普遍意义的经验。在组织义务劳动进行造林方面，贵阳市市长赵克强也总结出了一些具体作法。云岩区的中共区委书记靳子明，总结了用大辩论方法推动除四害运动的经验。
    这些经验对贵阳市各有关部门的工作很有指导意义。伍嘉谟在3月初总结了“反保守是试制新产品的前提”的经验并且加以推广之后，全市各厂矿掀起了试制新产品的高潮。到4月初，已试制成万能拖拉机、自动翻斗车、电动机等新产品三百四十多种。贵阳市从4月1日起推行商业局副局长同仁卿总结的“量体售布”和“量体裁衣”的经验，每套制服比老裁法平均节约棉布九寸，如果以全市每人每年做一套衣服计算，就可节约棉布五十四万尺。市文化局负责人3月中旬总结了富水区在五天半中普及全区群众文化网的经验，并且在全市推广后，目前各厂矿、街道、农业社已经建立起俱乐部，基本上完成了普及群众文化网的任务。
    在这一次总结先进经验的过程中，全体领导干部做到了深入基层，深入群众，亲自进行调查研究，亲自动手写总结，一改以往坐办公室听取汇报、叫秘书起草的作法。不少领导干部在亲自接触先进事物、亲自看到群众无穷无尽的智慧和潜力以后，更增强了跃进的信心和决心。
