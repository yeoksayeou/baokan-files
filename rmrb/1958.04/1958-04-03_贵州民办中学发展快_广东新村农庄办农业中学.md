Guizhou Province has not only established many good private primary schools, but also private middle schools have sprung up like mushrooms since last autumn. There are now 78 private middle schools in the province, distributed in 37 counties. Of these schools, 38 are located in rural areas and 40 are located in towns. Among them, 71 are completely private, 7 are private with public assistance, 76 are regular middle schools, and 2 are agricultural technical middle schools. Eight have already implemented a half-work, half-study system, and many others also engage in a small amount of production. These schools were all established by the masses actively requesting and personally doing the work.

The masses have come up with many solutions to the problems of funding, school buildings, and equipment for private middle schools. Regarding the solution of school funding, some are entirely funded by students. Some are funded by students in part, and then subsidized by cooperatives or mass fundraising, but students from impoverished families are exempt from or pay less tuition. Some are entirely solved by the public accumulation of cooperatives. In this regard, various places have created some different methods according to local conditions. For example, the Wuxing Advanced Cooperative in Sinan County allocates a portion of "cultural land" to the private middle school, which is cultivated by the students themselves, and the income is used for school funding. An agricultural cooperative in a private middle school in Bijie County not only allocated land, but also provided the students with 40 hoes. Most of the school's equipment is provided by students bringing their own desks and stools, or by the masses donating labor and materials. The masses believe that the most difficult problem to solve is the teachers for private middle schools. The Party and government leading departments have provided great help in this regard. Teachers with strong political and professional skills have been transferred from existing schools and institutions to private middle schools, and the masses have also hired some teachers, mostly high school graduates who have not been admitted to university. In many private middle schools, political classes are taught by cadres such as district and town party committee secretaries. With the help of local Party organizations, these schools have gradually gotten on track. Some schools have already established school affairs management committees with the participation of district, township, and cooperative leaders and parents, and some have established school boards of directors to supervise and manage school affairs. Some schools, which originally only studied and did not regularly participate in labor production, have now clarified the direction of work-study programs and are actively preparing to implement a half-work, half-study system. These schools will combine with the main activities of agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery labor production in their respective regions to arrange labor. (Xiao Ming)

According to the Southern Daily: Xincun Farm in Xincun Township, Shixing County, Guangdong, recently established a new farmer's middle school. There are currently more than 60 students, divided into two classes. One class recruits graduates of higher primary schools from the township, focusing on learning the main courses of junior high school and agricultural production knowledge. The other class absorbs cadres above the level of production team leader in the farm to participate in learning, combining literacy with cultural learning and technical learning. The township has allocated a public property building as a school building, and the farm has allocated 100 mu of fields, two fish ponds, and the masses have donated five head of cattle and a batch of agricultural tools as production investment for the school.

    贵州民办中学发展快
    广东新村农庄办农业中学
    本报讯　贵州省不仅民办小学办得多办得好，自去秋以来，民办中学也如雨后春笋地发展起来。现全省已有七十八所民办中学，分布在三十七个县。这些学校设立在乡村的有三十八所，设立在城镇的有四十所。其中完全民办的七十一所，民办公助的七所，普通中学七十六所，农业技术中学二所。已实行半耕半读的八所，其他也多兼营少部分生产。这些学校都是由群众积极要求并亲自动手办起来的。
    民办中学的经费、校舍、设备等问题，群众想出了许多解决办法。解决办学经费方面，有的全部都由学生出钱。有的由学生出一部，再由合作社或群众集资补助，但对家庭贫困的学生，规定了免交或少交学费。有的全由合作社公共积累中解决。在这方面，各地都因地制宜创造了一些不同的办法。如思南县的五星高级社，给民办中学拨一部分“文化地”，由学生自己耕种，收益作学校经费。毕节县的一所民办中学，农业社不但拨给地，还给学生打了四十把锄头。学校的设备大部分是由学生自带桌凳，或由群众献工献料解决的。民办中学的师资问题，是群众认为最难解决的。这方面党政领导部门给了很大帮助。从原有学校和机关中给民办中学调配了政治、业务都较强的教师，群众也聘请了部分教师，大多是未考上大学的高中毕业生。许多民办中学的政治课，都由区委、镇委书记等干部讲。这些学校在当地党组织的帮助下，已逐渐走上轨道。有的学校已经成立了有区、乡、社领导及学生家长参加的校务管理委员会，有的成立了学校董事会，监督和管理学校事物。有一些原只读书，不经常参加劳动生产的学校，现已明确了勤工俭学的方向，正积极准备实行半耕半读。这些学校都将结合本地区农、林、牧、副业劳动生产上的主要活动，安排劳动。（萧明）
    本报讯　据南方日报报道：广东始兴县新村乡新村农庄，最近新办了一所农民中学。现有学生六十多人，分两班，一班是招收本乡社高小毕业生，以学习初中主要课程和农业生产知识为主，另一班是吸收农庄生产队长以上的干部参加学习，边扫盲学文化，边学习技术。这个乡已拨出了一座公产楼房作为校舍，还由农庄拨出一百亩田、两口鱼塘，群众捐耕牛五头，农具一批，作为学校的生产投资。
