Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 5th: The Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation issued a statement on the 5th, warmly welcoming the Soviet government's decision to halt nuclear weapons testing. The statement said that the Soviet government's decision is a noble example of clearing the way for easing international tensions and meeting the wishes of all mankind.

The statement said that, however, the governments of two other major powers – the United States and Britain – have announced that they will continue nuclear weapons testing. The West German Federal Parliament has also decided to equip its army with atomic weapons; and many other countries are stepping up the construction of rocket launch sites. These can only be seen as activities to intensify war preparations.

The statement called on women around the world and women's organizations in all countries to actively wage a struggle, using all means to force those governments that want to continue nuclear weapons testing to immediately stop such testing.

On the same day, the Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation also published an open letter to women in the United States and Britain, asking them to redouble their efforts to force their parliaments to make a decision to stop nuclear weapons testing.

    国际民主妇联发出号召
    迫使美英停止核试验
    新华社柏林5日电　国际民主妇女联合会书记处5日发表声明，热烈欢迎苏联政府关于停止核武器试验的决定。声明说，苏联政府的这个决定是为缓和国际局势廓清道路和满足全人类愿望的崇高榜样。
    声明说，但是另外两个大国——美国和英国的政府却宣布要继续核武器试验。西德联邦议院也已经决定要用原子武器来装备它的军队；另外还有许多国家正在加紧建造火箭发射场。这些都只能被看作加紧备战的活动。
    声明号召全世界妇女和各国妇女团体积极进行斗争，用一切办法迫使那些要继续核武器试验的政府立刻停止这种试验。
    国际民主妇女联合会秘书处同一天还发表了一封致美英两国妇女的公开信，要求她们加倍努力，迫使她们的议会作出停止核武器试验的决定。
