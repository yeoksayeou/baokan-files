The Struggle Between Two Paths in Scientific Research
Tsinghua University Debates the Experiences of Two Paths in Scientific Research Work
By our reporter Bai Sheng

During the double-anti movement, many scientific research institutions and universities exposed the issue of the struggle between two paths in scientific research relatively deeply. In the previous period, Tsinghua University launched a major debate on this issue, and the teachers who participated in this debate gained a lot. Their experiences and gains in carrying out this debate are worth referring to for scientific research and higher education institutions.

The Problem is Raised

Since the reorganization of departments in 1952, Tsinghua University has undergone a series of teaching reforms and has been transformed from an old-fashioned comprehensive university into a new type of multidisciplinary industrial university. This is a fundamental change in the school's development process. A socialist direction has been basically established in teaching work, and scientific research work has also been gradually carried out. However, a group of bourgeois rightists led by Qian Weichang were not reconciled. They still fantasized about pulling Tsinghua University back to the old path of old Tsinghua, especially since they believed they had "capital" in scientific research work and wanted to compete with the working class. In addition, the thinking of many teachers in the school had not been thoroughly transformed, which enabled bourgeois rightists to find a market for selling capitalist goods in the school. Before the debate, out of the 65 teaching and research groups in Tsinghua University, only 14 had basically correct directions in scientific research work, 20 had serious errors in research direction, and the other teaching and research groups had unclear directions, with erroneous tendencies dominating.

At that time, what specific problems did the capitalist road in scientific research work at Tsinghua University manifest itself in? First, it was concentratedly reflected in the purpose of scientific research, that is, its political direction, which were the two key issues of whom scientific research should serve and whether or not the Party's leadership was needed. Secondly, it was reflected in whether or not theory should be linked with practice, whether or not scientific research work should be carried out in a planned and organized manner, and the relationship between scientific research work and teaching work. If these problems were not thoroughly resolved, they would constantly affect the development of teaching and scientific research work. In order to enable the vast number of teachers and students to distinguish right from wrong and recognize the direction, Tsinghua University launched a heated debate on the two paths in scientific research work among all teachers while holding scientific discussion meetings.

How Did the Debate Unfold?

At the beginning of this debate, the first difficulty encountered was that some teachers still had concerns in their minds. They did not clearly understand that the nature of this debate was to resolve contradictions among the people, and they were afraid to expose their thoughts. Secondly, many teachers, due to the influence of bourgeois ideology, did not fully realize the serious harm of taking the capitalist road in scientific research, and even doubted whether there was a struggle between two paths in scientific research. Some teachers believed that whether scientific research work could be carried out smoothly was mainly a matter of research conditions, not a matter of direction and road. As long as there are working conditions, one can write papers by reading books behind closed doors and burying oneself in research, and politics has nothing to do with scientific research. Some teachers believed that the issue of two paths was nothing more than whether to read British and American literature or Soviet literature. Some teachers also believed that since I am engaged in scientific research work in a socialist society, how can I serve capitalism?

In order to break down these ideological obstacles existing among teachers and to better carry out this ideological debate on the two paths, the school party committee first conducted in-depth investigation and research on this issue. Then, President Jiang Nanxiang and Vice President Liu Xianzhou made reports on the achievements made and some problems exposed in the school's scientific research work in recent years, as well as the ideological obstacles encountered. They explained that the struggle between two paths existed, and specifically analyzed the various concrete manifestations of bourgeois scientific research thinking in the school, its harm and consequences. At the same time, they also reviewed and self-criticized the leadership's past accommodation and appeasement of the capitalist line in scientific research work. Their reports greatly enlightened and promoted the teachers' thinking.

Next, the party and youth league branches of the teachers first conducted more in-depth discussions and debates on these issues in light of the specific circumstances of their units, thus further clarifying the nature of this debate and the essence of the differences between the two paths. At the same time, many party and youth league members among the teachers took the lead in examining and criticizing their bourgeois individualistic thinking and work style in scientific research work, as well as the concrete facts and harms of theory being divorced from practice. In addition, they also raised or criticized the capitalist scientific thinking and erroneous practices and tendencies of some teachers in the teaching and research group. Because the party and youth league members took the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism in the teaching and research group, the debate had a good start. In this way, teachers throughout the school successively threw themselves into the great debate of stating facts and reasoning in the discussion meetings of each teaching and research group and each department.

Various Manifestations of Capitalist Scientific Research Thinking

In the debate, various manifestations of capitalist scientific research thinking were exposed. These ideas surprised the teachers themselves. Among them, the bourgeois individual fame and profit-seeking ideology and the separation of theory from practice, the neglect of labor, the blind and unplanned research, and the harm of these ideas to scientific research work and teaching work were emphasized.

Due to bourgeois individualism and the pursuit of fame and profit, some teachers' purpose in engaging in scientific research was not for the needs of socialist construction, but to regard scientific research as a ladder for personal fame and gain, and to regard writing papers as capital for seeking fame and profit.

Many teachers are immersed in the decadent traditions left by old China to scientific research work, unilaterally emphasizing theory, neglecting practice, and despising labor. Their standards for scientific evaluation are that the more abstract theory, the greater the scientific value; the more mathematical formulas, the higher the theoretical level. As for whether it is beneficial to socialist construction, it is rarely considered or not considered at all. Some people even believe that if many complex mathematical formulas are not used, it is not scientific research at all. Their so-called scientific research is to blindly "find niches," "exploit loopholes," and "write articles" from the cracks in the literature. Some even have no actual data or data at all, but just play with mathematical formulas. In the selection of scientific research topics, these teachers are unwilling to study practical problems in production, thinking that these problems are too complicated and specific, the experiments are heavy, the workload is large, and they are also restricted by actual conditions and needs. Therefore, it is far better to sit in the study, find some topics from literature magazines, and do some paper calculations, which is easier to write papers and gain fame and profit. Some people choose topics needed for national construction, but in the research process, instead of conducting research on actual problems in national construction, they consciously or unconsciously avoid key problems to solve some secondary and easy-to-"accomplish" and "produce papers" side issues. Some people subjectively "create" the data or conditions of research topics from their own minds. In terms of scientific research cooperation, they generally do not want to cooperate or cooperate with others, for fear that they will not become famous, and that others will "exploit" their labor. For research work that cannot be carried out independently but must be carried out through collective cooperation, they calculate the ranking of publications and the amount of royalties. Due to excessive personal considerations, some teachers change several research topics a year in order to find a topic that is easy to become famous. A young lecturer saw a science fiction novel in the magazine "Knowledge is Power" and fantastically asked the school for a year's leave to conduct research on the so-called "underground boat," which is to use ultrasonic waves to crush rocks and pass underground to the United States. Due to the one-sided exaggeration of theory, the neglect of practice, and the contempt for labor, some teachers are unwilling to do experiments, unwilling to do calculations, and unwilling to collect data on the spot during the research process. As a result, their scientific research work has embarked on an "unscientific" path. They often "decentralize" these tasks, sit and wait for data, and do not check or review. Some people even make conclusions while others are collecting data or performing calculations or experiments for him, and then select and record the data that is consistent with the conclusions, and discard the data that is inconsistent, thus completing the so-called "scientific paper" with theory and data. A copper ball heat transfer test in the thermal engineering laboratory, according to theoretical analysis, the direction of the curve should be upward, but the experimental results were contrary to the textbook, and the curve always bent downward. Several teachers before and after each came up with their own reasons to explain this "abnormal phenomenon" to the students, and even asked the students to learn "how to look at the problem comprehensively" from this example. However, when the copper ball was disassembled during this rectification, it was found that the place in the copper ball that should have been filled with sand was partially air, so that the conduction of heat became convection, and the experimental results were naturally different. Some teachers leave the students alone when guiding experimental classes and sneak back to read books. Some teachers do not grade or perfunctorily grade students' homework. When a student submitted an experimental report, he only submitted the cover of the report. The teacher actually drew a "read" on the cover generously and sent it back.

Some teachers also keep research work confidential, and even develop academic monopoly; as soon as new books and materials arrive at the school, they borrow them home and lock them in their drawers. A professor in the Department of Architecture regarded teaching work as "carrying a sedan chair for others," and could only "output" but not "input"; he felt that doing this kind of work was too disadvantageous. In the six years since the reorganization of departments, he has not taught any other courses except for tutoring 15 students in the "Introduction to Architecture" course in one semester. He strictly keeps secrets in his academic work. In the past, when he lectured to students, he hurriedly covered his mouth with his hand when he came to the key points; when he found other teachers coming to listen to the class, he said: "This person is here to steal my things, it is simply exploitation." He is unwilling to discuss problems with others, for fear that he will involuntarily reveal the materials in the argument. He refuses to guide graduate students, saying, "I have been researching for many years, if you want me to guide you, isn't it exploiting me!"

Under the influence of bourgeois ideology, many young teachers are unwilling to undertake teaching work, and only want to follow "famous teachers" to engage in scientific research, and only want to write a paper to "become famous in one fell swoop." They are extremely irresponsible for teaching work, and cannot answer the questions raised by the students when giving tutoring classes.

Criticize Erroneous Ideas and Point Out the Correct Direction

This debate was combined with academic report meetings. The advantage of this combination is that criticism is launched during the discussion of academic reports, and at the same time, the results of academic discussion provide convincing examples for the debate.

In this debate, examining the work of teaching and research groups was a key. In some teaching and research groups, because bourgeois ideology dominated and the scientific research thinking of most teachers was chaotic, some detailed work was carried out in these teaching and research groups, and efforts were concentrated to break through a point, so it was easy to promote the development of the debate. At the same time, in order to make the debate deeper and more thorough, each teaching and research group paid attention to grasping key issues. In this debate, some teachers who had taken detours in scientific research work took the lead in conducting self-criticism in the teaching and research group, which played a great role in the in-depth development of the debate.

In order to prevent the discussion from becoming empty talk, after the teachers' thinking had initially clarified the struggle between the two paths, they further exposed the facts, found typical examples to launch discussions, and analyzed and criticized them. In order to truly solve ideological problems, especially some academic problems, the principles of presenting facts and fully reasoning were paid attention to in the debate, and endless disputes on academic evaluation issues that were difficult to draw conclusions on and some personal work styles were avoided. In order to make the debate convincing, in addition to exposing various manifestations of the bourgeois road, each department also found some typical examples of scientific research that conformed to the socialist road for comparison, so that not only was the error criticized, but also the correct direction was pointed out.

The scientific research working conditions of the Department of Electrical Engineering are quite good, and both human and material resources are relatively strong, but because the bourgeois scientific research thinking dominated in this department, the progress of scientific research work was very slow, and the teaching quality of some courses gradually declined. A few teachers even degenerated into rightists as a result. This is a bad example. On the other hand, the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing has difficulties in terms of manpower and material resources, but because their scientific research direction is relatively correct and most of their scientific research topics are aimed at national construction, their research achievements are relatively large. In the hydraulic structure teaching and research group of the Department of Water Conservancy, except for three professors, all are young teachers, and most of them graduated from university after 1952. However, because they have implemented the Party's policy and adhered to the principle of combining theory with practice and the principle of teaching and science complementing each other, plus the active efforts of the teachers, they have initially completed the reform of the entire teaching process in the first three years of teaching reform, and on this basis, they have relatively quickly carried out scientific research and continuously improved the teaching level. In just a few years, they have not only helped industrial departments solve many scientific problems raised in actual production, but also the scientific level of teachers and the teaching quality of teaching and research groups have been greatly improved. This is a good example. In the comparison of these good and bad examples, they broke down capitalist ideas and established socialist ideas.

Gains

After this debate, the teachers began to recognize the socialist road of scientific research work, and their ideological understanding has also been greatly improved. The teachers began to realize that the political direction, that is, the issue of whom to serve and the issue of the Party's leadership, is very important for carrying out scientific research work. They also deeply realized the great significance of politics being the commander and the soul in scientific research work. They also clearly saw that the capitalist scientific research line not only harms the scientific research work itself, but also reduces the teaching quality and corrodes and poisons people's minds.

After the debate, the teachers further realized the necessity and importance of ideological transformation, as well as the urgent need to be both red and expert. Some teachers had taken the wrong direction in the past, and after the debate, they felt very distressed and expressed that they must change course.

In the debate, many teachers recognized that science must serve socialism purposefully and that the combination of theory and practice is of profound significance for carrying out scientific research work. They realized that the standard for measuring scientific value is by no means the amount of "abstract theory," but to see whether it meets the requirements of socialist construction and whether it has sufficient and reliable scientific basis, and whether it can stand the test of practice. Without these, the so-called scientific research can only be meaningless empty talk. The combination of theory and practice is not only the basic principle of science serving socialism, but also the basis for the development of science. Because production is the rich source of science and the huge driving force for promoting the development of science. Of course, the development of science will also have a counter-effect on the development of production.

In this debate, it was also clarified that there are also two different paths in the cultivation and growth of young teachers. One is the bourgeois path of everything starting from personal fame and profit. People who take this path are only keen on personal advanced studies, personal fame, one-sidedly worship book knowledge and abstract theory, and look down on teaching work, production work, experimental and calculation work, and the work of collecting practical data on the spot. They "do not hear about production matters, and concentrate on theoretical books." As a result, not only is the teaching work not done well, but the professional level is not improved, and political thinking regresses. The other is the socialist road, everything starts from the needs of socialism, and while actively completing teaching tasks, they strive to learn professional skills and conduct scientific research work. They not only value book knowledge and improve theoretical level, but also are good at solid training in practical work, so they improve very quickly in politics and professionally.

Because the unhealthy trends have been hit, many teaching and research groups have begun to show new atmosphere. Old professors who have not been to the laboratory for many years have begun to go down, and some teachers have requested to increase the teaching workload, and have begun to revise scientific research topics that are divorced from reality, and have expressed their hope to go to factories and construction sites. Teachers have begun to care about the collective teaching and scientific research work of the teaching and research group, so that the work of the teaching and research group has changed from freedom and looseness to planned and organized, and at the same time, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism among teachers has also become strong.

In the current double-anti movement, Tsinghua University is carrying out the struggle between the two paths in teaching and scientific research work more deeply and thoroughly on the basis of this debate. The struggle between the two lines in teaching and scientific research work is essentially a struggle between two outlooks on life and worldviews. The victory of this struggle will not only bring great benefits to these works themselves, but also is one of the important links in the transformation of intellectuals. Through the debate and practice of these works, the ideological transformation of intellectuals will inevitably become more in-depth and profound. For some intellectuals, the transformation of teaching and scientific lines will bring them a more profound ideological change, so as to more powerfully promote their ideological transformation.

    科学研究两条道路的斗争
    清华大学辩论科学研究工作两条道路的经验
    本报记者　柏生
    在双反运动中，许多科学研究机关和高等学校都比较深刻地揭露了科学研究中的两条道路斗争的问题。在前一时期，清华大学曾就这一问题开展过大辩论，参加这次大辩论的教师都有很大收获。他们开展这场辩论的经验和收获，值得科学研究、高等教育机关参考。
                  问题的提出
    清华大学自从1952年院系调整以后，经过一系列的教学改革，已经从一所旧式的综合大学改变为新型的多科性工业大学，这是学校发展过程中的一个根本性的改变。在教学工作上已经基本上树立了社会主义的方向，科学研究工作也有了逐步开展。但是，以钱伟长为首的一批资产阶级右派分子，他们并不甘心，他们还幻想着把清华大学拉回到旧清华的老路上去，特别是他们自认为自己在科学研究工作上有“资本”，想和工人阶级较量一番。再加上学校中有不少教师的思想还没有得到彻底改造，这就使资产阶级右派分子在学校里找到了贩卖资本主义的货色的市场。在辩论前，清华大学全校六十五个教研组中，科学研究工作方向基本正确的教研组只有十四个，研究方向有严重错误的有二十个，其他教研组都是方向模糊不清，歪风占了优势。
    当时清华大学科学研究工作上的资本主义道路，究竟具体表现在哪些问题上呢？它首先集中地反映在科学研究的目的性，即它的政治方向上，也就是科学研究究竟为谁服务和要不要党的领导这两个关键问题上。其次，表现在要不要理论联系实际，要不要有计划有组织地进行科学研究工作，以及科学研究工作与教学工作的关系等问题上。这些问题不彻底解决，就时时刻刻地在影响着教学工作和科学研究工作的开展。为了使广大师生能明辨是非，认清方向，清华大学在召开科学讨论会的同时，在全校教师中热烈地展开了科学研究工作中两条道路的大辩论。
            辩论是怎样展开的？
    这次辩论一开始，首先遇到的困难，是在某些教师思想上还有顾虑。他们对这次辩论是解决人民内部矛盾的性质还认识不清，不敢暴露自己的思想。其次，许多教师由于受了资产阶级思想的影响，对走资本主义科学研究道路的严重危害性认识不足，甚至对科学研究中是否有两条道路的斗争，还有疑问。有的教师认为科学研究工作能否顺利进行，主要是研究条件的问题，不是什么方向和道路的问题。只要有工作条件，闭门读书，埋头研究，就可以写出论文，政治与科学研究没有什么关系。也有的教师认为两条道路问题，不过是看英美文献或看苏联文献的问题，也有的教师认为反正我是在社会主义社会里搞科学研究工作，难道我还能为资本主义服务。
    为了打破教师中存在的这些思想障碍，更好地进行这场两条道路的思想大辩论，学校党委会首先对这个问题进行了深入的调查研究工作，然后由蒋南翔校长和刘仙洲副校长对几年来学校在开展科学研究工作中所取得的成绩和所暴露出来的一些问题以及遇到的思想障碍作了报告，说明两条道路的斗争是存在的，并具体分析了资产阶级科学研究思想在校内的各种具体表现，它的危害性和后果。同时并对领导上过去对科学研究工作中的资本主义路线有某些迁就姑息的情况也作了检查和自我批判。他们的报告对教师们的思想有了很大的启发和推动。
    接着，教师党、团支部首先结合本单位的具体情况对这些问题进行了比较深入的讨论和辩论，因而更明确了这次辩论的性质和两条道路的分歧的实质。同时，教师中的许多党、团员在教研组里首先带头检查和批判了自己在科学研究工作中的资产阶级个人主义的思想和作风，以及理论脱离实际的具体事实及危害性。另外也提出或批判了教研组中某些教师的资本主义科学思想及其错误作法和倾向。由于党、团员在教研组里带头展开了批评与自我批评，使辩论有了很好的开端。这样，全校教师就在各教研组和各系的讨论会上先后投入了摆事实、讲道理的大辩论中来。
    形形色色的资本主义科学研究思想
    在辩论中，资本主义科学研究道路中的形形色色的思想都被揭露出来了。这些思想使教师们自己也大吃一惊。其中着重揭露了资产阶级个人名利思想和理论脱离实际、轻视劳动，盲目无计划的研究，以及这些思想对科学研究工作和教学工作的危害。
    由于资产阶级个人主义名利思想，有些教师搞科学研究的目的，不是为了社会主义建设的需要，而是把科学研究当作个人成名得利的晋升阶梯，把写论文当作求名得利的资本。
    许多教师沉溺于旧中国留给科学研究工作的腐朽传统，片面强调理论，轻视实际，鄙视劳动。他们的科学评价的标准是抽象理论愈多，科学价值就愈大；数学公式愈多，理论水平就愈高，至于是否对社会主义建设有利，则很少考虑或根本不考虑。有人甚至认为如果不运用许多复杂的数学公式，就根本算不得科学研究。他们所谓的科学研究，就是盲目地从文献夹缝中“找冷门”、“钻空子”、“作文章”。有的甚至没有一点实际资料或数据，只是玩弄数学公式。在科学研究的选题上，这些教师不愿研究生产中的实际问题，认为这些问题太复杂太具体，实验繁重，工作量大，而且还要受实际条件和需要的限制，因此，远不如坐在书斋里，从文献杂志上找点题目，作点纸上计算，容易写出论文，获得名利。也有人选了国家建设需要的题目，但在研究过程中，不是针对国家建设中的实际问题进行研究，而是有意识地或是不自觉地避开关键问题来解决某些次要而易于“建功”、“出论文”的枝节问题，还有人从自己头脑中主观“创造”研究题目的数据或条件。在科学研究的合作方面，他们一般不愿与别人合作或配合进行，怕自己出不了名，怕别人“剥削”了自己的劳动。对不能单独进行研究而必须集体合作的研究工作，他们就计较发表的名次和稿酬的多少。由于个人考虑过多，有的教师一年更换好几个研究题目，为的是想找到一个易于成名的题目。有一个青年讲师，研究题目换来换去，当他在“知识就是力量”杂志上看到一篇科学幻想小说时，竟异想天开的要求学校给假一年，去作所谓“地下之舟”的研究，就是利用超声波粉碎岩石，从地下通到美国去。由于片面夸大理论，轻视实际，鄙视劳动，有些教师在研究过程中，不愿意做实验，不愿意做计算，不愿意到现场收集资料。因而使他们的科学研究工作走上了“不科学”的道路，他们常常把这些工作来个“下放”，坐以等待数据、不进行核对不进行审查。有的人甚至一面让别人替他收集资料或进行计算或实验，一面已经做出结论，等数据一来，即择其与结论相符者而取录之，择其不相符者而舍弃之，因而就完成了所谓有理论、有数据的“科学论文”。热工学实验室有一个铜球传热试验，按理论分析，曲线弯曲方向应该向上，可是实验结果却与教科书上相反，曲线总是向下弯，前后几个教师各想出各的理由来对学生解释这种“反常现象”，甚至还要求学生从这个事例里边学会“如何全面看问题”。但在这次整改中拆开铜球时，发现原来铜球内应灌满砂子的地方，一部分已是空气，因而使热的传导变成了对流，实验结果自然就不同。有些教师指导实验课的时候，把学生放下不管，自己溜回去看书。还有的教师不批改或草率批改学生的作业。有一个学生交实验报告时，只交了一张报告的封皮，这位老师居然也大大方方的在封面上画了一个“阅”字，发了回去。
    还有的教师在研究工作上保密，甚至发展到学术垄断；学校新的图书资料一到，就借回家去，锁在自己的抽屉里。建筑系有一个教授，把教学工作看作是“替别人抬轿子”，只能“输出”，不能“输入”；认为干这种工作太吃亏了。院系调整后六年来，他除了有一学期辅导过十五个同学学习“建筑初步”课程以外，就没有教过别的课。他在学术上严格保密。以前他给学生讲课，讲到关键处，就赶忙用手捂住嘴巴；讲课时发现有别的教员来听课，他就说：“此人来偷听我的东西，简直是剥削。”他不愿同别人讨论问题，怕在争论中情不自禁地露了材料。他拒绝指导研究生，说“我研究了多年，你要我来指导，岂不是剥削我！”
    在资产阶级思想的影响下，不少青年教师不愿担负教学工作，只愿跟着“名师”搞科学研究，一心只想写出篇论文来“一举成名”。他们对教学工作极不负责，在上辅导课时不备课，对同学们提出的问题回答不上来。
        批判错误思想　指出正确方向
    这次辩论是和学术性报告会结合进行的。这种结合进行的好处是：在讨论学术报告时就展开了批评，同时学术讨论的结果，又为辩论提供了具有说服力的例证。
    在这次辩论中，检查教研组工作是一个关键。有些教研组因为资产阶级思想占了统治地位，多数教师的科学研究思想混乱，对这些教研组进行一些细致工作，集中力量突破一点，这样便容易推动辩论的展开。同时为了使辩论进行得较深较透，每个教研组都注意抓住了重点问题。在这次辩论中，一些在科学研究工作上走了弯路的教师，带头在教研组中进行了自我批评，对辩论的深入开展起了很大的作用。
    为了使讨论不流于空谈，在教师思想初步明确了两条道路斗争以后，就进一步揭发事实，找出典型事例展开讨论，分析批判。为了能够真正解决思想问题，特别是一些涉及学术性的问题，在辩论中注意了摆出事实、充分说理的原则，并避免在难于作结论的学术评价问题上以及一些个人作风上争论不休。为了使辩论有充分说服力，除了揭露资产阶级道路的各种表现外，各系还找出了一些符合社会主义道路的科学研究的典型事例，进行对比，这样就不仅批判了错误，而且指出了正确的方向。
    电机系的科学研究工作条件是相当好的，无论人力、物力都比较雄厚，但是由于资产阶级的科学研究思想在这个系里占了优势，科学研究工作进展很慢，部分课程的教学质量也逐渐下降，有少数教师甚至由此而堕落成为右派分子。这是一个坏的例子。另一方面，机械制造系人力、物力方面均有困难，但因为他们的科学研究方向比较正确，大部分科学研究题目是针对国家建设的，因此他们的研究成绩就较大。水利系水工结构教研组内，除三位教授外，都是青年教师，而且大多数是在1952年以后大学毕业的，但是因为他们贯彻了党的方针，坚持了理论联系实际和教学与科学相辅相成的原则，再加教师们的积极努力，他们在教学改革的头三年内，就初步完成了全部教学过程的改革，并且在这个基础上比较迅速地开展了科学研究，并不断提高了教学水平。在短短的几年内，他们不但帮助产业部门解决了不少生产实际提出的科学问题，而且教师的科学水平及教研组的教学质量也获得了较多的提高。这是一个好的例子。他们在这种好坏事例的对比中，打破资本主义思想，确立社会主义思想。
                    收　获
    经过这场辩论，教师们开始认清了科学研究工作的社会主义道路，思想认识也有了很大提高。教师们开始认识到政治方向就是为谁服务的问题和党的领导的问题，这一根本问题对于开展科学研究工作是非常重要的。他们还深刻地认识到在科学研究工作中政治是统帅、是灵魂的重大意义。他们也明确看到了资本主义科学研究路线不但危害科学研究工作本身，而且还使教学质量降低，腐蚀和毒化人们的思想。
    经过辩论，教师们进一步体会了思想改造的必要性和重要性，以及又红又专的迫切需要性。有些教师过去走错了方向，辩论以后，感到十分痛心，表示必须改弦易辙。
    在辩论中，许多教师认清了科学要有目的地为社会主义服务和理论联系实际对于开展科学研究工作的深刻意义。他们认识到衡量科学价值的标准，决不是“抽象理论”的多少，而是要看是否符合于社会主义建设的要求和是否具有充分的可靠的科学根据，以及能否经得起实践的考验。离开了这些，所谓科学研究就只能是没有意义的空谈。理论联系实际不仅是科学为社会主义服务的基本原则，而且也是发展科学的依据。因为生产是科学的丰富源泉，是推动科学向前发展的巨大动力。当然，科学的发展也将反作用于生产的发展。
    在这次辩论中，还明确了对青年教师培养成长的问题上，也存在着两条不同的道路。一条是资产阶级的一切从个人名利出发的道路，走这条道路的人，只热衷于个人进修，个人成名，片面地崇拜书本知识和抽象理论，看不起教学工作，生产工作实验及计算工作，到现场收集实际资料的工作，“两耳不闻生产事，一心专攻理论书”，结果不但教学工作搞不好，业务水平也提不高，政治思想倒退。另外一条是社会主义的道路，一切从社会主义的需要出发，在积极完成教学任务的情况下，努力学习业务和进行科学研究工作。他们不但重视书本知识和提高理论水平。而且善于在实际工作中踏实锻炼，因此在政治上和业务上都提高得很快。
    由于歪风受到打击，许多教研组开始出现了新气象。多年不下实验室的老教授开始下去了，有的教师要求增加教学工作量，并且开始修改理论脱离实际的科学研究的题目，纷纷表示希望到工厂工地去。教师们开始关心教研组的集体教学和科学研究工作，使教研组的工作从自由散漫转变到有计划有组织，同时教师中批评与自我批评的风气也浓厚了。
    在目前的双反运动中，清华大学正在这次辩论的基础上，更深更透地进行着教学和科学研究工作中的两条道路的斗争。教学和科学研究工作中的两条路线的斗争，实质上是两种人生观和世界观的斗争，这一斗争的胜利，不仅会给这些工作本身带来巨大的好处，而且也是改造知识分子的重要环节之一。通过这些工作的辩论和实践，知识分子的思想改造必然会更加深入和深刻。对于某些知识分子来说，教学和科学路线的改造，会给他们带来更加深刻的思想改变，从而更有力地推动他们的思想改造。
