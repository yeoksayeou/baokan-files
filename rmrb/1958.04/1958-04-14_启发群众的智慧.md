Inspire the Wisdom of the Masses
Tian Lianqian

The tool reform movement that started in water conservancy construction is now gradually being extended to the entire field of agricultural production. Large and small innovations and reforms are emerging one after another. In just four months, the masses in Changge County, Henan Province, created 48 kinds of tools for lifting water, grinding flour, transporting soil, plowing land, sowing seeds, and accumulating fertilizer, totaling more than 35,700 pieces, with an average increase in labor efficiency of tenfold.

The reform of old tools and the creation of new tools show the infinite wisdom accumulated among the masses. How to deeply inspire the wisdom of the masses and accelerate the tool reform movement is a question that all regions should be considering at present. On this issue, some advanced areas in tool reform have provided valuable experience. Summarized, there are the following points:

First, put the most prominent problems in production before the masses, guide the masses to conduct in-depth discussions, and find solutions. Because the topic is clear, the strength is easy to concentrate, and things are relatively easy to handle. In water conservancy construction, the task of transporting soil is very heavy, so the masses created many transportation tools and lifting tools. This year, Cang County, Hebei Province, has become the region with the most water lifting tools created in the province, which is also the result of the leaders of this region entrusting the most prominent water lifting problem in production to the masses for discussion.

Second, many regions in Henan, Hebei, Yunnan, Hubei and other provinces have used the method of holding exhibitions or organizing on-site visits and evaluations when mobilizing the masses. This method is of great benefit to inspiring the wisdom of the masses and is a good key to liberating the minds of the masses. Changge County, Henan Province, organized more than 480 large and small visits in three months, with 58,000 visitors. An important reason why the county was able to quickly set off a wave of tool reform throughout the county was the frequent organization of visits and exhibitions. The tool creations of Changge farmers are mostly the result of farmers seeing them with their own eyes. Houhe Township has more water-powered mills, and the local farmers first created water-powered automatic waterwheels. Chengguan Township has a long history of making bellows, and the farmers there were the first to create a bellows-style double-dragon water pump. These experiences show that it is a good way to inspire the wisdom and creativity of the masses by constantly exposing the masses to new things through visits and evaluations, learning, doing, comparing, and reforming.

Third, leaders should give active support and assistance in the process of mass reform and creation of tools. When Meng Xiangyi, a farmer in Jiaohe, Hebei, created a wooden waterwheel, some commune members said he was "not working, just messing around." The county party secretary personally encouraged him, and he was determined to create it successfully in five days. Obviously, the masses bear a heavy material and spiritual burden in creative activities. Without the timely support and encouragement from the leadership, this creative activity would be difficult to sustain.

Fourth, tool reform requires both universality and continuous improvement in quality and efficiency. In the middle of this, handicraft workers and scientific and technical workers have an indispensable role. Sometimes, as long as they provide some, even ordinary, technical knowledge, it may promote things to move forward a big step. Farmers in Jinghai, Hebei, have successfully tested the use of windmills to drive flour mills, but the wind power is sometimes strong and sometimes weak, and there is no way to control it, and the flour produced is sometimes fine and sometimes coarse. Not long ago, some scientists went to visit and proposed a simple and easy-to-implement method, which helped the farmers solve the problem. It can be seen that the combination of the creative spirit of handicraft workers, technicians and farmers is very important.

    启发群众的智慧
    田连阡
    在兴修水利中开展起来的工具改革运动，现在正逐步推向整个农业生产领域。大大小小的创造和改革，真是层出不穷。河南长葛县群众在短短四个月内，创造了提水、磨面、运土、翻地、播种、积肥等工具四十八种，三万五千七百多件，劳动效率平均提高十倍。
    旧工具的改革和新工具的创造，显示出群众中蕴蓄着无穷无尽的智慧。怎样深入地启发群众的智慧，加快工具改革运动，是目前各地都应当考虑的问题。在这个问题上，若干工具改革先进地区提供了一些宝贵的经验。概括起来有以下几点：
    第一，是把生产中最突出的问题提到群众面前，引导群众深入讨论，寻找解决办法。由于题目明确，力量易于集中，事情也就比较容易办好。在兴修水利中，运土任务很大，群众就创造了许多运输工具和起重工具。河北沧县专区今年成为全省创造提水工具最多的地区，也是由于这个专区的领导人把生产中最突出的提水问题交给群众讨论的结果。
    第二，河南、河北、云南、湖北等省的许多地区，在发动群众时都运用了开展览会或组织现场参观评比的办法。这种办法对启发群众智慧有很大好处，是解放群众思想的一把好钥匙。河南长葛县在三个月内组织了大小型参观四百八十多次，参观者达到五万八千人。该县所以能够迅速地在全县掀起改革工具的热潮，经常组织参观展览是一个重要原因。长葛农民在工具方面的创造，多半农民亲眼看的结果。后河乡水打磨较多，当地农民首先就创造了水打自动水车。城关乡历史上做风箱的很多，那里的农民便第一个创造了风箱式二龙吸水机。这些经验说明，通过参观评比，使群众不断接触新事物，一面学，一面做，一面比，一面改，是启发群众智慧和创造力的好办法。
    第三，在群众改革和创造工具的过程中，领导上要给以积极的支持和帮助。河北交河农民孟祥义创造木制水车，有社员说他是“不干活，瞎胡闹”。县委书记亲自去勉励了他，他才下定决心用五天时间创造成功。很明显，群众在创造活动中的物质负担和精神负担都重。如果没有领导上及时的支持和鼓励，这种创造性的活动就很难坚持下去。
    第四，工具改革既要求普遍，也要求质量、效率日益提高。在这中间，手工业工人、科学技术工作者有不可忽视的作用，有时他们只要供给一些哪怕是普通的技术知识，便可能促使事情向前大进一步。河北静海农民试用风车带动面磨已经成功，但是风力时强时弱，没有办法控制，磨出的面时细时粗。不久以前有一些科学家去参观，提出一个简便易行的办法，便帮助农民解决了问题。可见手工业工人、技术人员和农民的创造精神结合，是十分重要的。
