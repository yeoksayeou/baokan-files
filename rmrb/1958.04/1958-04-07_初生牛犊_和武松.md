    "Newborn Calves" and Wu Song
    He Ming

    Some people often use the saying "newborn calves are not afraid of tigers" to criticize (ridicule) young people's naivety and rashness. Is this criticism correct? Naivety and rashness are naturally not good, but young people, precisely because they are young and lack experience, cannot be without a bit of childishness. What attitude should be adopted towards their childishness? Moreover, isn't the spirit of young people daring to be "the first in the world" always better than the stagnant atmosphere of "not being the first in the world"?

    "Newborn calves are not afraid of tigers"—they have not fought tigers, and have not even seen them; to say they are not afraid is naturally unreliable. If someone tells them: tigers are just like cats, you can crush them to death with one foot, there is nothing to be afraid of; we must resolutely oppose this. But if someone tells them: tigers are extremely terrifying, it is unacceptable that you are not afraid, you should be afraid; can we agree with this? No, we should equally resolutely oppose it. Isn't that right? Imagine: if Wu Song saw a group of young people who were not afraid of tigers, what attitude would he take? He would never pour cold water on the young people's heads, telling them to be afraid. He would be extremely happy, encourage their courage, explain the nature of tigers to them, and teach them the martial arts of tiger-fighting. He would definitely think that the childishness of young people should not be ridiculed, because tiger-fighting heroes also grow up from childhood!

    Some adults, however, do not adopt Wu Song's attitude towards young people's "not being afraid of tigers"; instead, they ridicule them in every possible way, saying that their childishness has not subsided, and even scold them as ignorant children, in a word: they should be afraid. Why do they adopt this attitude? In a word: they themselves are not Wu Song, and have been scared out of their wits by tigers. Being tempered by worldly affairs for a long time is a good thing; but for them, it has only tempered a fear. What they call prudence, caution, and careful consideration are nothing more than shields for their fear. They do consider a lot indeed. We do not oppose and even advocate careful consideration, but the result of their consideration is often to retreat before advancing, and everything must be postponed, which must be opposed. We also do not oppose and even advocate prudence and caution, but prudence and caution to the point of hiding in a safe and doing nothing must be resolutely opposed. Not doing anything is indeed a safe haven, because once inside, no mistakes can be made; only one mistake is made in life: not doing anything. Isn't this the biggest and most unforgivable mistake for a revolutionary?

    Childish (but) active, stagnant (but) lazy; "newborn calves are not afraid of tigers," "tempered for half a lifetime, afraid of caterpillars"—who exactly should be ridiculed?

    Therefore, there are two schools of criticism and guidance for young people's naivety and rashness: the promotion school and the demotion school. The promotion school tells young people the experience and skills of "tiger-fighting," helping them grow in practice, removing naivety and rashness, and wanting them to be tiger-fighting Wu Songs. These are good elder brothers and good teachers for young people. The demotion school only tells young people how terrifying "tigers" are, and ridicules their fearlessness in every possible way, objectively wanting them to be cowards. Young people should also learn lessons from these people.

    “初生牛犊”和武松
    何明
    有人常常用“初生牛犊不怕虎”这句俗话来批评（讥笑）青年人的幼稚和莽撞。这批评对不对？幼稚和莽撞自然是不好的，然而青年人正因为是青年人，缺乏阅历和经验，因而也就不能没有一点子稚气，对他们的稚气应该采取什么态度呢？而且，青年人敢为“天下先”的精神比那种“不为天下先”的暮气，总是好的多吧？
    “初生牛犊不怕虎”——它没有和老虎斗过，甚至还没有见过；说不怕，自然是靠不住的。如果有人对它说：老虎就和猫儿似的，你一脚就能把它踩死了，没有什么可怕的；我们要坚决反对。但如果有人对它说：虎可怕极了，你不怕是要不得的，应该怕啊；我们能赞同吗？不能，应该同样地坚决反对。不是这样吗？你想：如果武松见到一批不怕虎的青少年，会采取怎样地态度呢？他决不会给青少年劈头浇一瓢冷水，叫他们怕起来。他会高兴得不得了，鼓励他们的勇气，给他们讲清虎性，教给他们打虎的武艺。他一定认为，对青少年的稚气不该讥笑，因为打虎的勇士也是从小长大的啊！
    有的成年人，对青年的“不怕虎”，却不是采取武松的态度；而是百般讥笑，说他们稚气未退，甚至骂他们是黄口孺子，一句话：该怕。他们为什么会采取这种态度？也是一句话：他们自己不是武松，被老虎吓破胆了。久经世事磨练是好事；可是对于他们说来，却只是磨练出了一股子怕劲。什么谨慎啦，小心啦，多多地考虑啦，都不过是怕劲的挡箭牌。他们确也是考虑得很多的。我们并不反对并且提倡多考虑，可是他们考虑的结果往往是未进先思退，凡事都要退后一点，这就必须反对。我们也并不是反对而且提倡谨慎、小心，但是谨慎小心到钻进保险柜，一事不干，却是必须坚决反对的。不干事，确实是保险柜，钻到里边去，什么错误也犯不了；平生只犯一条错误：不干。这一条，对于革命者说来不是最大的不可原谅的错误吗？
    稚（气）而干，暮（气）而惰；“初生牛犊不怕虎”，“磨练半生怕毛虫”——究竟谁才是该被讥笑的呢？
    所以对青年人的幼稚、莽撞的批评和引导，也有两派：促进派和促退派。促进派给青年人讲“打虎”的经验和本事，帮助他们在实践中成长，去掉稚气和莽撞，要他们做打虎的武松。这是青年人的好兄长好老师。促退派给青年人单讲“老虎”的可怕，百般讥笑他们的不怕，客观上是要他们做懦夫。青年人也应该从这种人身上吸取教训。
