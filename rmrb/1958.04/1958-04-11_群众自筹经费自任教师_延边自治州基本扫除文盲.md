Masses Raise Funds and Appoint Teachers
Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture Basically Eliminates Illiteracy

(Our report) According to the Jilin Daily, the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture has basically eliminated illiteracy. Currently, among the 355,656 young and middle-aged people in the prefecture, 81.85% have reached a cultural level equivalent to or above primary school.

Before liberation, the cultural education of the people of Yanbian was quite backward, with more than 80% of the population being illiterate. After liberation, cultural and educational undertakings have greatly developed. Party organizations and governments at all levels in the autonomous prefecture regularly combine amateur cultural education with various production activities and other central tasks, and adopt the method of "assigning areas, contracting responsibilities, and having each level take charge" to conduct specific leadership.

The Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture has adopted the mass line approach in its literacy work. The masses raise funds themselves and appoint their own teachers. The funds for farmers' spare-time schools are resolved through income from collective sideline production or land reclamation by the students. The teachers are the broad masses of literate people who do not receive any remuneration. In recent years, the Communist Youth League's activity of "each cultured League member teaching one illiterate person" has been very effective. Li Longxue, a member of the Communist Youth League, created a rapid literacy method for adults in Korean during the literacy campaign, which was promoted throughout the prefecture, greatly shortening the literacy time for adults.

    群众自筹经费自任教师
    延边自治州基本扫除文盲
    本报讯　据吉林日报报道：延边朝鲜族自治州已经基本上扫除文盲。现在，全州三十五万五千六百五十六名青壮年中，已有81.85％达到初级小学以上文化水平。
    解放前，延边人民的文化教育相当落后，80％以上人口都是文盲。解放后，文化教育事业得到了很大发展。自治州的各级党组织和政府经常结合各项生产和其他中心工作，统一布置业余文化教育，并且采取“分片包干，层层负责”的做法，进行具体领导。
    延边自治州在扫盲工作中采取了群众路线的方法。由群众自筹经费，自任教师。农民业余学校的经费，由学员集体经营副业生产或开荒种地的收入解决。教师由不取任何报酬的广大识字的群众来担任。几年来，共青团员中开展的“每个有文化的团员包教一名文盲”的活动，收效很大。共青团员李龙学在扫盲工作中创造了成年人的朝鲜文速成识字法，在全州推广后，大大缩短了成年人的扫盲时间。
