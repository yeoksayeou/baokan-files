Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 10th: Sakari Tuomioja, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, said on the 9th that unless capitalist countries take coordinated international action to solve the current economic problems, a decline in economic activity throughout the capitalist world will occur.

In his speech at the opening of the thirteenth plenary session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Tuomioja pointed out that the US economy is in recession, and most industrial countries in Western Europe are experiencing stalled economic expansion due to pressure from foreign trade balance of payments problems and rising prices. Raw material producing countries outside of Europe have also been severely affected due to difficulties in selling raw materials.

Tuomioja urged European capitalist countries not to only look after themselves and seek their own way out in the face of the threat of a capitalist world economic recession. He said: "If countries only focus on solving their own problems without considering the possible impact of their actions on neighboring countries, a chain reaction may form, resulting in a more severe decline in economic activity."

Tuomioja also expressed opposition to the tendency of some Western European countries to unite economically. He said that this would create artificial barriers for other countries.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 10th: An advance copy of the April 11th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" writes in its "Business Around the World" column: The (US) economic recession now shows signs of spreading across the Atlantic.

The magazine says: The atmosphere in European business circles is changing. In early winter last year, optimism was generally expressed. There was an assumption that the American economic recession was nothing significant. Now, questions have greatly increased and confidence has greatly decreased. People are becoming more cautious. Ideas of expanding (enterprises) are gradually being dispelled.

The changes in Europe are not just psychological. In most countries, business activity in recent weeks seems to be slowly declining from its peak.

The magazine says: European consumers, like American consumers, are currently becoming more cautious about their daily purchases. This is a new factor in Europe.

If the decline in European business truly intensifies, it will be bad news for American exporters in Europe. It will also be bad news for raw material countries, because raw material producing countries usually export nearly twice as much to Western Europe as they do to the United States.

The magazine listed some unfavorable signs appearing in European capitalist countries:

	West Germany: The industrial situation in the Ruhr is bleak. Steel production is declining due to reduced sales. There is a lot of stored coal. Coal mines are reducing production. Consumers are becoming cautious when buying goods. Orders for consumer goods to factories are decreasing. Export orders have decreased.

	Italy: There is not much momentum for the rise of industrial activity. Industries such as construction, household appliances, textiles, and paper have already declined. The cost of living is rising. Retail sales are worse than last year. Cases of failure to pay installments on time in installment sales are increasing.

	Switzerland: Although the business situation is still good, there has been some decline in export orders, especially in chemicals. Car sales are decreasing.

	Belgium: Eager to rely on the Brussels International Exposition to stimulate the stagnant economic situation. Industries such as coal, steel, cement, and textiles are currently experiencing some difficulties. Unemployment is growing. The central bank's discount rate has recently been lowered to stimulate activity. Recent export performance is "disappointing."

	Netherlands: The number of unemployed is quite high. Various "stimulus" plans are being implemented. Interest rates have been lowered again.

	Scandinavian countries: In general, the decline in industrial and commercial conditions is becoming apparent. Denmark's export situation has been "disappointing," and unemployment is becoming a problem. Finland is now in a true depression, businesses are declining, and large numbers of people are unemployed. Norway not only has an unusually high number of unemployed people, but also a decrease in shipping freight income. In Sweden, the government is preparing unemployment relief plans, and its export industry feels the impact of the economic recession.

The magazine concludes: Thus, you can see troubling signs appearing in many European countries, especially those north of the Alps.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th: Sir Hugh Beaver, Chairman of the Federation of British Industries, said today that the economic recession currently occurring in the United States is "more aggressive" than the two recessions that occurred after the war in 1949-1950 and 1953-1954. Therefore, Britain is facing more difficulties and competition.

He said at the annual meeting of the Federation of British Industries today, "All indications are that we are entering a situation different from the post-war era up to mid-1957."

Beaver expressed unease about the sharp drop in commodity prices on the capitalist world market and the development of "strong, ambitious industrial nationalism" in some newly independent countries. He said that all of this makes the problem more difficult for Britain.

    资本主义世界经济活动衰退
    西欧受到美国冲击情况不佳
    新华社10日讯　日内瓦消息：联合国欧洲经济委员会执行秘书萨卡里·杜米奥雅9日说，除非资本主义国家采取协调的国际行动来解决当前的经济问题，整个资本主义世界的经济活动的衰退就将要出现。
    杜米奥雅在联合国欧洲经济委员会第十三届全体会议开幕时的讲话中指出：美国的经济正在衰退，西欧大多数工业国家由于受到对外贸易收支平衡问题和物价上涨的压力，经济扩展正在停顿，欧洲以外的原料出产国家因为原料销售困难也受到了严重的影响。
    杜米奥雅要求欧洲资本主义国家不要在资本主义世界经济衰退的威胁面前只顾自己，各寻出路。他说：“如果各国只顾解决自己的问题而不顾它们的行动对邻国可能发生的影响，就可能形成一个连锁反应，结果会带来更严重的经济活动的衰退”。
    杜米奥雅还表示反对某些西欧国家在经济上进行联合的倾向。他说，这会给其他的国家树立起人为的障碍。
    新华社10日讯　纽约消息：提前出版的4月11日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”，在世界各地商业情况栏中写道：（美国）经济衰退目前显出正在蔓延到大西洋彼岸的迹象。
    这家杂志说：欧洲商界中的气氛正在改变。在去年初冬，普遍表示乐观。有这样一种假定：美国的经济衰退没有什么了不起。而现在疑问大大增加，信心大大减少了。人们变得更加谨慎了。扩充（企业）的念头正在逐渐打消。
    欧洲的变化不仅是心理上的变化。大部分国家在最近几周的商业活动看来好像正在从顶峰慢慢下降。
    杂志说：欧洲的消费者，像美国消费者一样，目前对他们的日常购买越来越谨慎了。这是欧洲的一个新因素。
    欧洲商业下降如果真正加剧的话，对于在欧洲的美国出口商来说是一个坏消息。这对于原料国家来说也是一个坏消息，因为原料生产国对西欧的出口量通常为对美国出口量的将近两倍。
    杂志列举了欧洲资本主义国家中出现的一些不妙的迹象：
    西德：鲁尔的工业情况暗淡。钢铁产量正在下降，因为销路减少。储存的煤很多。煤矿正在减少产量。消费者在购买货物时又谨慎起来。向工厂订购消费品的订货单正在减少。出口订货减少了。
    意大利：工业活动上升的动力不多。建筑工业、家庭用具工业、纺织工业和造纸工业等部门已在下降。生活费用在上涨。零售情况比去年差。分期付款销售方面到期付不出钱的情况在增加。
    瑞士：商业情况虽然还好，但是在出口订货方面有某些下降，特别是在化学品方面。汽车销售量在减少。
    比利时：非常想靠布鲁塞尔的国际博览会来刺激停滞的经济情况。煤、钢、水泥和纺织等工业目前都有一些困难。失业在增长。中央银行的贴现率最近已经降低以刺激活动。最近的出口情况是“令人失望”的。
    荷兰：失业人数相当高。正在执行各种不同的“刺激”计划。利息率再次降低。
    斯堪的纳维亚国家：一般说来工商业情况的下降正在变得明显起来。丹麦的出口情况一直“令人失望”，而且失业正在成为问题。芬兰现在处于真正的萧条，企业在衰退，大量的人失业。挪威不仅有异常高的失业人数，而且航运运费收入也在减少。在瑞典，政府正在准备失业救济计划，它的出口工业感到经济衰退的影响。
    杂志最后说：这样，你就可以看到令人烦恼的迹象在很多欧洲国家中出现，特别是在阿尔卑斯山以北的那些国家中。
    新华社伦敦9日电　英国工业联合会主席比佛爵士今天说，目前在美国发生的经济衰退比战后1949—1950年和1953—1954年所发生的两次衰退“更加咄咄逼人”，因此，英国正在面临着更多的困难和竞争。
    他在英国工业联合会今天举行的年会上说，“一切迹象都表明，我们正在进入一种同到1957年年中为止的战后年代的情况不同的处境中”。
    比佛对于资本主义世界市场上商品价格的剧烈下跌和一些新独立国家的“强烈的、雄心勃勃的工业民族主义”的发展表示不安。他说，这一切对英国来说都使问题变得更加困难。
