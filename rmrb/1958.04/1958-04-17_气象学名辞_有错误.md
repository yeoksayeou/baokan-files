    “Meteorological Terminology” Has Errors
    The “Russian, Chinese, and English Meteorological Terminology” was compiled by many famous Chinese meteorologists entrusted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. However, the editing time was very long, and there are still errors, which is truly unacceptable. There are two mistakes on the very first page, and some pages have as many as seven or eight errors (such as page 43), and some are even laughably wrong. In addition to hoping that the Science Press will take responsibility for its readers and find a way to remedy this, I also hope that our country’s meteorologists will show their enthusiasm and earnestly learn from the advanced meteorological science of the Soviet Union.

    “气象学名辞”有错误
    “俄、中、英气象学名辞”是中国科学院委托我国许多著名气象学家编订的。但是编辑时间很长，而且还有错误，真是不应该的。翻开第一页就有两个错，有些页上竟错到七、八个（如43页），甚至错得十分可笑。我除了希望科学出版社为了对读者负责，应该设法补救。我还希望我国的气象学家拿出干劲，认真向苏联先进的气象科学学习。
