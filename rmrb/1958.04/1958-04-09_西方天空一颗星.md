Title: A Star in the Western Sky

    A star in the western sky,
    Paul Robeson, a warrior for peace.
    Dark clouds loom, sand and stones fly,
    But the star shines brightly.
    Son of a Black slave, worker by birth,
    A great artist with the essence of the working people,
    Class oppression, national discrimination,
    Thousands of degrees of fire refine true gold.
    Peaceful songs resound throughout the world,
    War-mongers gnash their teeth in hatred.
    Thunderous roars rush into palaces,
    Millionaires are scared out of their wits.
    "Free world" is just a paper facade,
    Inside is murder by electric chair.
    What "freedom to travel!" - a slap in the face,
    The whole country is a concentration camp.
    How can a throat be sealed?
    How can a mouth be nailed shut?
    Thoughts can fly beyond the universe,
    Can songs really be fingerprinted?
    The American people love you -
    "Paul is our spokesperson."
    Progressive humanity defends you -
    "Don't hurt Robeson!"
    Liberated China embraces you -
    "You are as close as a brother to us,
    The eastern skies await your songs,
    We wish you a life as long as the Southern Mountain, and evergreen as pine and cypress!"

    西方天空一颗星
    袁水拍
    西方天空一颗星，
    和平战士罗伯逊。
    乌云压顶，飞沙走石，
    唯有星星亮晶晶。
    黑奴的儿子，工人出身，
    大艺术家本色是劳动人民，
    阶级压迫，民族歧视，
    几千度的烈火炼真金。
    和平歌声，响遍世界，
    战争贩子切齿痛恨。
    震天的怒吼冲进宫殿，
    百万富翁吓掉魂。
    “自由世界”原是纸糊招牌，
    里面的货色是杀人电刑。
    什么“旅行自由！”自打嘴巴，
    全国成了个集中营。
    喉咙怎能贴封条？
    嘴巴怎能钉铁钉？
    思想可以飞翔到宇宙之外，
    歌声难道好捺指纹？
    美国人民热爱你——
    “保罗是我们代言人”。
    进步人类保卫你——
    “不许伤害罗伯逊！”
    解放了的中国拥抱你——
    “你和我们是兄弟般亲，
    东方的云霄期待着你的歌声，
    祝你寿比南山，松柏常青！”（附图片）
