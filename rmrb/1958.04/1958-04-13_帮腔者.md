    The Claque
    Following the U.S. State Department’s expression of "regret" over the Indonesian government's purchase of weapons from socialist countries, the British authorities also came out to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs, clamoring that this was "a serious mistake."
    The United States said "regret," while Britain went a step further, asserting that it was a "mistake," and a "serious mistake" at that. This is precisely the nature of a claque. Generally, a claque is nothing more than: before others open their mouths, he first observes their expressions, and once someone says "a sika deer is a horse," he will immediately add that this "horse has eight horns." Britain is precisely playing such a claque role.

    帮腔者
    继美国国务院对印度尼西亚政府从社会主义国家购买武器表示“遗憾”之后，英国当局也跟着美国出来干涉印度尼西亚内政，它叫喊说，这是“一个严重的错误”。
    美国说“遗憾”，英国则进了一步，断言说那是“错误”，而且还是“严重的错误”。这倒是帮腔者的本色。大凡帮腔者都不外乎是：人家没开口时，他先察颜观色，等人家一说“梅花鹿是马”，他就会接着说这“马长了八个犄角。”英国正是扮演了这样一个帮腔者的角色。
