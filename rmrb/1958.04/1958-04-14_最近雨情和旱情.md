Recent Rainfall and Drought Conditions

Since the beginning of spring, rainfall in many parts of the country has been scarce. During the first ten days of April, the rainfall in areas north of the Yellow River, western mountainous regions, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and most parts of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces was less than half of the average rainfall for the same period in previous years. Zhanjiang area of Guangdong Province received only one millimeter of rainfall, while Yangjiang received three millimeters. Wuzhou in Guangxi received thirteen millimeters, and Baise received four millimeters. The Northeast Plain, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Gansu, southern Xinjiang, western Qinghai, and parts of Shaanxi, Yunnan, and Hainan Island mostly received no rainfall at all. Cities like Shenyang, Harbin, Hohhot, Baotou, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Lanzhou experienced no rain.

During these ten days, the rainfall in the Yangtze River basin was more than twice the average for the same period in previous years, with some areas exceeding three or four times the average.

In March, rainfall in southern Inner Mongolia, most of Liaoning Province, northeastern Hebei, most of Gansu, the southern Xinjiang basin, various parts of the Southwest, most of Guangxi, and southern Guangdong was generally less than half of the average rainfall for the same period in previous years, with most parts of the Hetao area and the southern Xinjiang basin experiencing no rain throughout the month. The Greater Khingan Mountains, most of the Nenjiang Plain, the Tianshan Mountains, and most of the lower reaches of the Yellow River received relatively more rainfall, generally exceeding the average rainfall for the same period by about double.

Areas currently experiencing drought conditions include parts of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, but the severity of the drought varies in each region.

    最近雨情和旱情
    入春以来，全国很多地区降雨不多。4月上旬，黄河以北、西部山地、云贵高原及广东、广西大部地区的降雨量，多不及历年同时期降雨量的一半。广东湛江地区仅降雨一公厘，阳江降雨三公厘；广西梧州降雨十三公厘，百色四公厘。东北平原、内蒙古、河北、甘肃、新疆南部、青海西部及陕西、云南与海南岛的部分地区，多半没有滴水下降，沈阳、哈尔滨、呼和浩特、包头、保定、石家庄、兰州等地都没有下雨。
    在这十天内，长江流域降雨量约超过历年同期一倍以上，个别地区超过三、四倍。
    3月份内，内蒙古南部、辽宁省大部、河北东北部、甘肃大部、南疆盆地、西南各地、广西大部及广东南部等地，降雨量一般都不到历年同时期降雨量的一半，河套及南疆盆地大部地区全月无雨。比较多雨的是大兴安岭山地、嫩江平原大部、天山山地及黄河下游大部地区，一般多超过历年同期雨量一倍左右。
    现在呈现旱象的地区有——河北、山西、陕西、甘肃、青海、四川、贵州、广西等地部分地区，但旱象程度各不相同。
