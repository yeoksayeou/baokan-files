Xinhua News Agency report: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's cultural and artistic circles held a Great Leap Forward congress in Urumqi on March 28.

More than 1,100 people attended the congress, including 41 cultural and artistic organizations. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Branch of the Chinese Writers Association put forward Great Leap Forward targets for creating novels, plays, film scripts, poetry, essays, and literary criticism within three years. The preparatory committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Music Association challenged all songwriters in Xinjiang, guaranteeing that every lyric would have a melody, and that a collection of Xinjiang folk songs would be compiled and published. The Autonomous Region Song and Dance Troupe proposed spending 50% of its time performing for workers and peasants in factories and rural areas. The Autonomous Region Han Chinese Drama Troupe resolved to work hard for a year, crash-course learn the Uygur language, and perform for minority audiences in the Uygur language next year.

Saifuddin, Secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting. He encouraged everyone to study Marxism-Leninism theory hard, thoroughly criticize local nationalism, first strive for a great leap forward in ideology, and then strive to overfulfill their planned targets. He stated that in addition to doing his own work well, he also planned to write three literary works within three years and co-write a play with Han Chinese literary worker Wang Yuhu.

    少数民族文艺丰收在望
    新疆维吾尔自治区文艺界开跃进大会
    据新华社讯　新疆维吾尔自治区文化艺术界3月28日在乌鲁木齐举行跃进大会。
    参加大会的有一千一百多人，包括四十一个文化艺术团体。中国作家协会新疆维吾尔自治区分会提出了三年内创作小说、剧本、电影剧本、诗歌、散文、文学评论等的跃进指标。新疆维吾尔自治区音乐协会筹委会，向全疆作词者提出挑战，保证作到有词就有曲，并编印出新疆民歌集等。自治区歌舞团提出要用50％的时间下厂下乡为工农演出，自治区汉族话剧团，决心苦战一年，突击学会维吾尔语，明年用维吾尔族语言为少数民族观众演出。
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会书记赛福鼎在会上讲了话，他鼓励大家努力学习马列主义理论，彻底批判地方民族主义思想，先争取思想上的大跃进，再争取超额完成自己所订的计划。他表示除作好自己担负的工作外，还准备在三年内写三篇文学作品，并和汉族文学工作者王玉胡合写一个剧本。
