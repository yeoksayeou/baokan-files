    Ox-Powered Train
    Members of the Zhangcun Agricultural Cooperative in Shilong County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, have created an "ox-powered train" based on the design of a train and the principles of carrying weight.
    This train only requires one person to drive it, and one or two oxen can pull a large cart and four or five smaller carts. Each train can carry about 3,500 jin (approximately 1750 kg) at a time, which is three and a half times more than the carrying capacity of old-fashioned ox carts.　Xinhua News Agency reporter He Guozheng photographed

    牛力列车
    广西僮族自治区石龙县樟村农业社的社员根据火车的形式及载重原理制造了一种“牛力列车”。
    这种列车只需一个人驾驶，一头或两头牛可以拉一个大车和四五个小车。一列车每次可载三千五百斤左右，比老式牛车单运的载重量提高了三倍半。　新华社记者  何国正摄
