    Panyu Achieves Methane Gasification Before the Summer Harvest
    A Batch of County-Run Backbone Enterprises Are About to Be Completed; Chemical Fertilizers, Universal Tractors, Steamships, and Indigenous Automobiles Can All Be Produced This Year; Cement Can Be Entirely Self-Sufficient.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 4th (Reporters Xu Shi and Xu Shiwen): The entire Party in Panyu County, Guangdong Province, has been mobilized, and all the people have been mobilized to set up small methane gas power stations in every commune, preparing power for commune-run factories.

    In March, 68 communes across the county had already started construction of small methane gas power stations. According to the person in charge of the Panyu County Party Committee, all 236 communes in the county will have their power stations completed before the summer harvest, achieving methane gasification throughout the county, and solving the power needed for commune-run factories. These methane gas power stations under construction are all built by slightly reforming the self-made granular fertilizer factories already built by agricultural communes in various places. When building the methane gas power stations, the agricultural communes contribute their own labor. The cement used for the methane gas digesters is locally made, and the methane gas pipelines are also made of local ceramic pipes. In this way, generally, it only takes an investment of about 400 yuan to build a factory that can drive ten horsepower for fertilizer production and use methane gas as power.

    The enthusiasm of the commune members for building power stations is very high. Some farmers in the Shatou Agricultural Commune have prepared to change the manure originally intended for managing their private plots into raw materials for the fermentation tanks of the methane gas power station. The Guoxing Commune started construction of a methane gas power station the day after mobilizing commune members to speak out freely on the issue of setting up factories within the commune. Recently, they also built a road overnight, preparing to welcome newly purchased automobiles for both transportation and power. The investment movement for agricultural communes to set up factories is currently surging like a spring tide, with investment exceeding 200,000 yuan within a few days. The Yongkou Commune received a total of 20 taels of gold invested by commune members overnight.

    Using granular fertilizer factories as power stations not only ensures a reliable source of fertilizer for agricultural production but also increases fertilizer efficiency by about 30%. With methane gas power stations, it is also possible to increase granular fertilizer production and enable some handicraft workshops to carry out technological reforms.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 4th (Reporters Xu Shi and Xu Shiwen): The Panyu County Party Committee has decided that this year, both the county and townships should build a large number of small-scale and high-efficiency factories. The sea fertilizer factory with an annual output of 20,000 tons, the bacterial fertilizer factory with an annual output of 1,200 tons, and the shipyard with an annual output of 100 steamships have recently been put into production. New factories such as the nitrogen fertilizer factory with an annual output of 8,000 tons, the cement factory with an annual output of 20,000 tons, and agricultural and sideline product processing factories have also started construction one after another and are expected to be put into production in May and June. Many products that have never been produced locally, such as universal tractors, wind-powered engines, internal combustion engines, steamships, and "indigenous automobiles," are being rushed to manufacture or trial manufacture and repair. This year, the county is also preparing to promote 2,000 universal tractors, 236 rice transplanters, 100 steamships, and 136 automobiles. Currently, each township is preparing to build agricultural machinery repair and assembly factories, locally-made cement factories, and nitrogen fertilizer factories by making comprehensive use of local materials. The county will run large factories, and the communes will run small factories. In a few years, a situation will emerge in which state-owned county-run industries are the backbone, with industries in every township and factories in every commune.

    Xinhua News Agency report: Panyu County has decided to build three cement factories without clinker, and each township will build a small cement factory without clinker. The first county-run cement factory without clinker is currently under construction, and the other two will also begin construction immediately. It is planned that all can be put into production in May. After these three cement factories are completed, the annual cement production can reach 20,000 tons. In this way, the cement needed for general medium and small-sized water conservancy projects in the county can be completely self-sufficient. If the locally made cement factories in each township are completed, the cement for civilian use can also be completely self-sufficient.

    There are three types of cement without clinker manufactured in Panyu County: one is made from coal cinder; one is made from bagasse; and the other is made from broken bricks and tiles. The method of manufacturing cement without clinker is very simple. Just buy an iron mill (a stone mill is also acceptable), grind broken bricks and tiles, coal cinder, or bagasse ash into a fine powder, and mix it with quicklime powder (25%) and gypsum powder (5%) in a ratio of 70% to 30%. The cost of manufacturing 100 jin of cement without clinker is 1.5 yuan, which is more than half the price of high-grade cement, and the project quality is not affected. (Attached picture)

### 全党全民动手　群众出钱出力  番禺夏收前实现沼气化  一批县营骨干企业即将建成；化学肥料、万能拖拉机、汽船、土汽车今年都可以生产；水泥可以全部自给。

    全党全民动手　群众出钱出力
    番禺夏收前实现沼气化
    一批县营骨干企业即将建成；化学肥料、万能拖拉机、汽船、土汽车今年都可以生产；水泥可以全部自给。
    本报广州4日电　记者许实、许世文报道：广东省番禺县全党动手，全民动员，社社办小沼气动力站，为社社办工厂准备动力。
    在3月里，全县已经有六十八个社动工兴建小沼气动力站。据中共番禺县委负责人估计，全县二百三十六个社的动力站，将在夏收前全部建成，全县实现沼气化，社社办工厂所需要的动力将得到解决。这些正在兴建的沼气动力站，都是利用各地农业社已经建成的自制颗粒肥料厂，稍加改革后建成的。建设沼气动力站的时候，农业社自己出劳力。沼气池用的水泥是土制的，沼气管道也是用土瓷管。这样，一般建一座能带动十马力的制肥和利用沼气作动力两用的工厂，只用四百元左右的投资。
    社员们兴建动力站的积极性非常高。沙头农业社一些农民已准备把原来打算用来经营自留地的大粪，改作沼气动力站发酵池的原料。国星社就社内办工厂问题发动社员鸣放后的第二天，便动工兴建沼气动力站。最近还连夜修筑大路，准备迎接新购回来的运输、动力两用的汽车。各地农业社兴办工厂的投资运动目前有如春潮汹涌，几天之内投资款额已超过二十万元。涌口社一夜之间收到社员投资的黄金共二十两。
    利用颗粒肥料厂作动力站，不仅保证农业生产经常有可靠的肥源，而且肥效还能提高30％左右。有了沼气动力站，还能增加颗粒肥料产量，能使一些手工作坊进行技术改革。
    本报广州4日电　记者许实、许世文报道：中共番禺县委决定，今年内，县和乡都要兴建大批规模小、收效大的工厂。年产二万吨的海肥厂、年产一千二百吨的细菌肥料厂和年产一百艘汽船的造船厂最近已经投入生产。年产八千吨的氮肥厂、年产二万吨的水泥厂以及农副产品加工厂等新工厂，也已经先后动工，预计5、6月份即可投入生产。许多当地从未生产过的产品，如万能拖拉机、风力发动机、内燃机、汽船、“土汽车”等都正在加紧赶制或试制修配。全县今年还准备推广万能拖拉机二千部，插秧机二百三十六部，汽船一百艘，汽车一百三十六部。现在，每个乡正在准备就地取材，综合利用，兴办农业机械修配厂、土制水泥厂和氮肥厂。县办大的，社办小的。几年后，一个以国营县办工业为骨干、乡乡办工业、社社办工厂的局面就会出现。
    本报讯　番禺县决定兴建三个无熟料水泥厂，每个乡兴建一个小型无熟料水泥厂。目前县营的第一个无熟料水泥厂正在兴建，其余两个也即开始兴建，计划在5月份都可以投入生产。这三个水泥厂建成后，年产水泥可达两万吨。这样，全县兴建一般中、小型水利工程需要的水泥，都可全部自给。如果各乡土制水泥厂建成后，民用水泥也可以完全自给。
    番禺县制造的无熟料水泥有三种：一种是以煤渣为原料制成的；一种是用蔗渣制成的；另一种是以烂砖瓦为原料制成的。制造无熟料水泥的方法很简单，只要买一个铁磨（石磨也可以），把烂砖瓦、煤渣或蔗渣灰磨成细粉，按70％与30％的比例和生石灰粉（25％）、石膏粉（5％）混合即可。制造一百斤无熟料水泥的成本是一元五角，比高标号水泥便宜一半以上，工程质量也不受影响。（附图片）
