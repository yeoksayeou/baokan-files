    Be Safe!
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Shenyang factories and construction enterprises recently held a safety production leap forward conference. Responsible persons from more than fifty units issued safety production challenges to factories and construction enterprises throughout the city. Representatives from more than three hundred units participating in the conference unanimously passed a proposal for a great leap forward in safety production, initiating a friendly competition with cities such as Benxi, Anshan, Dalian, and Fuxin. The conditions they proposed are: to basically eliminate major injury and death accidents in the fourth quarter of this year, and to reduce minor injury accidents by 30% compared to last year's frequency; equipment failure and downtime will be reduced by 50% compared to last year. They also put forward specific targets for reducing occupational and common diseases. (Zhao Guoyou, Wen Shuxian)
