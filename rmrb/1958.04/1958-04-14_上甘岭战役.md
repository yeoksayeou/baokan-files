    Battle of Triangle Hill

    The Battle of Triangle Hill is one of the most famous battles of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. This battle took place in mid-October of 1952, when the enemy concentrated a superior force of more than 50,000 troops and, with the support of a large number of airplanes, tanks, and artillery, launched a fierce attack on our positions on Triangle Hill, which was less than four square kilometers in area. By the end of November, when the battle ended, the enemy had dropped more than 10,000 bombs and napalm bombs on this position and fired more than 1.9 million shells. Our army repelled more than 900 enemy assaults. As a result, the enemy paid the price of more than 25,000 casualties, but did not occupy an inch of our land. The enemy's original intention in launching this offensive was to achieve "a bit of victory" during the session of the Seventh United Nations General Assembly. The result was a serious defeat. Even the enemy admitted that the losses suffered in this battle were second only to the losses suffered in the great retreat from northern Korea in 1950 under the joint attack of the Chinese and Korean troops, considering this "the second battle with the most losses of elite troops." The Volunteer Army saw many heroic figures emerge during this battle. The Special Class Hero Huang Jiguang was the most famous.

    上甘岭战役
    上甘岭战役是抗美援朝战争中最著名的战役之一。这次战役发生在1952年的10月中旬，当时敌人集中了五万以上的优势兵力、并在大量飞机、坦克、大炮配合下向我上甘岭不到四平方公里的阵地猛攻。到11月底这次战役结束时，敌人向这个阵地投了一万余枚炸弹和凝固汽油弹，发射了一百九十余万发炮弹，我军打退敌人九百多次冲锋，结果敌人付出了死伤两万五千余人的代价，却没有占到我方一寸土地。敌人发动这次进攻的目的本来是企图在联合国第七届大会开会期间取得“一点胜利”，结果反而遭到了严重失败。连敌人都承认这次战役中遭受的损失仅次于1950年在中朝部队联合打击之下从朝鲜北部大溃退所受的损失。认为这是“第二次损失精锐部队最多的战役”。而志愿军在这次战役中出现了许多英雄人物。特等英雄黄继光便是最著名的一个。
