(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 17th) The nationwide movement of North Korean farmers to build small and medium-sized irrigation projects, which was launched last winter and spring, has achieved great success.

According to statistics from the North Korean Ministry of Agriculture, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have already built more than 21,000 small and medium-sized irrigation projects using their own resources. Before the rice transplanting season this spring, the irrigated area of paddy fields can be expanded by 60,000 chongbo (approximately 15 Chinese mu per chongbo). In these projects, North Korean farmers have excavated more than 13 million cubic meters of earthwork alone.

In order to strive for self-sufficiency in grain production this year, North Korean farmers have been working with great enthusiasm. They have worked hard through a winter and spring, blasting mountains and splitting rocks, building dams and digging canals, building reservoirs, and constructing pumping stations to pump water up the mountains. In addition, they have dug ponds and wells, trying every means to develop water sources. They have transformed barren hillsides and saline-alkali beaches into paddy fields for growing rice.

Since there are many mountains in northern Korea, the construction of pumping stations and reservoirs is the main form of irrigation projects built in Korea this year.

The North Korean government has vigorously helped and supported the farmers' movement to build irrigation projects.

    开山劈岭　修坝挖渠　苦战一冬一春
    朝鲜各地农业社兴水利
    据新华社平壤17日电　朝鲜农民在去冬和今春掀起的兴修中小型灌溉工程的全民性的运动，目前已经取得了很大成就。
    据朝鲜农业省的统计，目前各地农业社用自己的力量兴修的中小型灌溉工程，已经有二万一千多项。在今春插秧期前，可扩大六万町步（每町步大约合十五市亩）的水田灌溉面积。朝鲜农民在这些工程中仅挖土方就有一千三百多万立方。
    朝鲜农民为了争取今年的粮食产量达到自给自足的程度，劳动热情十分高涨，他们苦战了一冬一春，开山劈岭，修坝挖渠，修水库，建抽水站，把水抽上山。另外还挖池塘，打水井，千方百计地开辟水源。把荒瘠的山坡和遍地盐碱的海滩都改造成生长稻谷的水田。
    朝鲜北部山地多，因此今年朝鲜兴修的灌溉工程中建抽水站和兴修水库是主要的形式。
    朝鲜政府大力帮助和支持了农民们这一兴修灌溉工程的运动。
