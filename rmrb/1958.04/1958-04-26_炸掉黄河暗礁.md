    In the section of the Yellow River within Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, personnel from the Inner Mongolia Shipping Bureau are blasting away reefs in the Yellow River to enable year-round, day-and-night navigation, even against the current.

    Along the Yellow River banks from Baotou to Dayushuwan in the Ik Zhaomeng League, a distance of 480 li, many coal mines have been discovered in recent years, and these coal mines will be successively opened. But where will the extracted coal be transported from? If transported by land, the roads are rugged and transportation is very inconvenient. The best way is through Yellow River shipping. However, many reefs are scattered along this waterway, preventing not only wooden boats from navigating, but also making it impossible for motorized vessels to travel upstream. What to do? The only solution is to blast away the reefs!

    炸掉黄河暗礁
    在内蒙古自治区境内的黄河道上，内蒙古航运局的人员正在炸掉黄河暗礁，做到能在黄河上逆水行舟，四季通航，日夜通航。
    从包头到伊克昭盟大榆树湾四百八十华里的黄河两岸，近年来发现了好多处煤矿，这些煤矿即将陆续开采。但是开采的煤从哪里运出呢？如果从陆地上运，道路崎岖不平，交通十分不便。最好的办法是通过黄河航运。可是这段航道上却散布着不少的暗礁，不仅木船不能通航，就是机动船也无法逆流而上。怎么办呢？只有把暗礁炸掉！
