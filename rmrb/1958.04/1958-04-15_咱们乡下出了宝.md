    “Our Countryside Has Produced a Treasure…”
    Qin Mu
    Every time I fill out a survey form and get to the "Hometown" section, or when people ask about this, I write and say "Chenghai" without any particular attitude. And the listeners don't have any particular reaction either. Because everyone has a hometown, and there are more than two thousand counties in the country. Apart from a few historical cities, how can every one of them attract attention?
    But in recent years, it has been different. When we talk about this county, people often exclaim admiringly: "Oh, you're from Chenghai!" The reason for this is that this county has had many new things happen in recent years. Just like the villagers who come to the provincial capital smilingly say: "Chenghai is simply producing treasures now...."
    Speaking of which, it does seem like a treasure has been found, because this originally ordinary county has attracted the attention of the entire province, and even the whole country, in the past few years.
    I want to talk about the geese in our county first. This county was originally a famous production area of "Lion Head Geese". When I was young, I had the impression that the geese in the countryside were particularly large, some reaching nearly thirty catties, and a goose egg weighed ten taels. The people who raised geese always said that if you raised them well, a goose could gain half a catty of meat in a day and night. Later, when I went to other provinces, I saw that the general geese were very small, and I thought: "Maybe other places are not used to slaughtering the geese when they are too old. Maybe I saw things bigger when I was a child." In recent years, I realized that the geese in our county are indeed larger than those in other places. The reason is that this county has a tradition of "goose competitions" for many years. In the past, during the parades and festivals, each family had to slaughter the biggest goose and put it on the offering table at the door, so that people could compare and see whose goose was outstanding. Over a long period of time, this custom has had the effect of unconscious artificial selection on the geese, just like the principle of selecting excellent varieties from goldfish and pigeons through long-term breeding. In the past, if a certain place's breed was a bit bigger, it was just bigger. Who would pay attention to such a thing! But it's different now. Good things should be promoted throughout the country. So the Lion Head Goose of Chenghai took a triple jump, jumping to the special zone, then to the provincial capital, and then to the National Agricultural Exhibition. In this way, it became a well-known breed like the Jiujin Yellow and the Beijing Duck.
    Chenghai is one of the several famous "thousand-jin counties" in eastern Guangdong. And because of its good crop rotation experience, it has leaped to become the county with the highest average yield per unit area in the country. When I was young, I saw my family buy sweet potatoes to feed the pigs. The sweet potatoes were often surprisingly large, generally weighing three or four catties each (at that time, there was no such thing as moonflower grafted sweet potatoes), which was very different from ordinary sweet potatoes. Later, I learned that this kind of sweet potato was not planted after the autumn harvest, but was rotated once after a mu of land had been planted with rice for three or five years. This kind of rotated sweet potato often yielded more than 10,000 catties per mu, and each one was fat and large. (Usually, winter-planted sweet potatoes can only yield one to two thousand catties). Calculating four catties of sweet potatoes as one catty of rice, plus winter crops, the highest yield can reach more than 3,000 catties per mu. With the continuous increase in rice field yields, it ranked first in the country. This year, everyone is talking about the number 1,628, which means that the average yield must reach 1,628 catties, and it looks like the 2,000-catty mark can be surpassed in a few days.
    In our county, there is also an agricultural labor model who cultivated an excellent variety of rice, which has attracted a lot of attention. This agricultural labor model went to North Korea a few years ago to express his condolences, and a North Korean agricultural labor model gave him a few catties of outstanding rice seeds. This kind of rice has short stalks, is wind-resistant, has full grains, and does not lodge, making it most suitable for planting in coastal areas. Many people asked for these few catties of seeds along the way. When the labor model returned to his hometown, he only had a few taels left in his pocket. He was afraid that if he planted them all at once, he would not succeed and all his previous efforts would be in vain. So he planted them in several times, a few qian of seeds at a time. The first two times were not successful, but the third time was successful, and he harvested a few catties of grain. He then widely spread these few catties of grain. Now, this kind of rice has appeared in many places throughout the province.
    In our county, there is also a township called Nanmeizhou, whose radishes are famous in the nearby counties. This kind of radish can grow up to seven or eight catties each. The reason why it can grow so fat is largely due to the cultivation methods in addition to the soil. When the farmers there till the radish fields, they often till to a depth of nearly two feet. This kind of radish seed is wanted everywhere, and even overseas Chinese plantations come to order it. Therefore, it also adds glory to the name of the county to some extent.
    The highways in our county are well-connected. Many bicycles carry goods and people on them. Therefore, many strong cyclists have been trained, some of whom can carry more than a thousand catties of goods on a bicycle. In the national bicycle competition, the county produced many champions.
    I am not boasting when I write these things. It's just that from one corner we can clearly see the rapid changes in the countryside. Every county, every province, has so many fresh stories! Some counties have become models for afforestation. Some counties have completely eliminated the four pests. Some counties are particularly good at raising pigs. Some counties have been particularly successful in eliminating illiteracy. Everyone is competing for leadership, and everyone is making contributions. This constitutes a magnificent and youthful picture of our motherland.

    “咱们乡下出了宝……”
    秦牧
    每次当我填什么调查表，填到籍贯这一栏的时候，或者当人家问到这方面的事情的时候，我写上和说出“澄海”两个字，一向并没有什么特别的态度，听的人也没有什么特别的反应。因为家乡总是每人都有一个的，全国有两千个以上的县份，除了一些历史的名城，那能够个个都惹人注意呢。
    但是近年来不同了。当我们谈到这个县份的时候，人们常会赞叹地道：“哦，你们是澄海的呀！”事情所以这样，是因为近年来这个县出了许多新鲜事。正像到省城里来的乡人们笑嘻嘻地说的那样：“澄海现在简直是出了宝啦……。”
    讲起来，的确像是出了宝，因为这个本来平平凡凡的县，这几年却有好些事情引起全省，以至全国的注意了。
    我想先谈谈我们县里的鹅。这个县原来是著名的“狮头鹅”的产地。幼年的时候，我有一个印象，就是乡下的鹅特别大，有大到近三十斤的，一个鹅蛋就有十两重。养鹅的人总是说，养得好，一昼夜鹅就可以长肉半斤。后来我到其他省份去，看到一般的鹅都很小，心想：“也许是别的地方不习惯把鹅养得太老了才宰。也许童年时候看东西看得大些。”近几年来才知道我们县里的鹅确是比其他地方大的。原因是这个县历年来有“赛大鹅”的习俗，从前游神赛会的时候，各家都要把顶大的鹅宰了摆在门口的供案上，让人们评比评比，看谁家的鹅出色。长期以来，这种习俗就对鹅起了无意识的人工选择的作用，就正象人们在长期饲养下从金鱼和鸽子中选出优秀的品种来的道理一样。从前，某个地方的品种大一些就由它大一些好了，谁去注意这样的事情呢！但现在不然了，好的东西就要在全国推广。于是澄海的狮头鹅就来了个三级跳远，一跳跳到专区，再跳跳到省城，三跳跳到全国农业展览会。这样，它就像九斤黄和北京鸭那样，变成谁都知道的品种了。
    澄海是粤东几个著名的“千斤县”中的一个。而且由于轮作的经验好，它又一跃而成为全国平均单位面积产量最高的县份。幼年的时候，看家里的人买番薯来喂猪，常常有一种番薯大得惊人，普遍的每个都有三几斤重（当时还根本没有月光花嫁接番薯这回事呢），和平时一般的番薯大不相同。后来，才知道这种番薯不是秋收以后种的，而是当一亩田种了三几年水稻以后，就轮种一次番薯。这种轮种的番薯一亩往往可以收到一万斤以上，个子个个肥大。（通常冬种的番薯只能收一千几百斤）。以四斤番薯折一斤大米计算，加上冬种作物，最高产量竟有每亩达到三千斤以上的。加上稻田的产量不断增加，于是，在全国考了个头名了，今年大家都在讲一千六百二十八这个数目字，原来是平均产量要达到一千六百二十八斤，眼看二千斤这根竿，几天内就可以跳过去了。
    我们县里，又有个农业劳动模范，培养出一种水稻的优秀品种，受到了很多人们的注意。这位农业劳动模范，几年前到朝鲜去慰问了一次，一位朝鲜的农业劳动模范赠给他几斤出色的水稻种子。这种水稻秆短，耐风，穗粒饱满，不会倒伏，种在近海地区最合适。这几斤种子一路上给人家要去了不少。劳模回到乡下时，口袋里只存下几两了。他恐怕一次种下去，不能成功后前功尽弃。就分几次种，一次下几钱种子。第一二次没有成功，第三次成功了，收得了几斤谷子。他又把这几斤谷子广为传播。现在，这种水稻已经在全省许多地方出现了。
    我们县里又有一个乡，叫做南梅州，它出的萝卜是附近各县都闻名的，这种萝卜一个可以大到七八斤。所以能长得如此肥大，除了土壤外，耕作方法也有很大的关系。那里的农民给萝卜田翻土的时候，往往翻到近两尺深。这种萝卜种子到处都有人要，甚至海外华侨的种植园也来订货。因此，它也多少给这个县的名字添上了光荣。
    我们县里的公路是四通八达的。许多单车在这上面载货和载人。因此训练了许多健壮的单车运动员，他们中有人竟能用一辆单车载货千多斤的。在全国单车竞赛的时候，县里出了许多冠军。
    我写下这么一些事情，并不是吹嘘什么。只是，从一个角落我们就很可以看到农村面貌的迅速变更。每一个县，每一个省，各有多少新鲜的事迹呀！有的县，植林成了模范。有的县，完全消灭了四害。有的县，养猪特别好。有的县，扫盲格外成功。大家都在互争雄长，大家都作出了贡献。这，就构成了我们祖国的一幅气象万千的青春的图画了。
