    People are eagerly anticipating seeing historical facts from various revolutionary struggle periods and the heroic images of revolutionary martyrs on the stage. The "February 7th Storm" performed by the China Railway Art Troupe and the "Red Storm" performed by the China Youth Art Theater are both plays created based on the historical facts of the February 7th Movement. Both plays depict the heroic struggle of Chinese railway workers, under the leadership of the Party, against the imperialists and feudal warlords of the time. The plays vividly portray the glorious images of martyrs such as Lin Xiangqian and Shi Yang, and praise their heroic deeds.

    两个“风暴”
    人们迫切地期望从舞台上看到我国各个革命斗争时期的史实和革命烈士的英雄形象，中国铁路文工团演出的“二七风暴”和中国青年艺术剧院演出的“红色风暴”，就是根据二七运动的史实而创作的戏。两个戏都描写了我国铁路工人在党的领导下，同当时的帝国主义、封建军阀所进行的英勇斗争。剧中，很好地描绘了林祥谦、施洋等烈士的光辉形象，歌颂了他们的英雄事迹。
