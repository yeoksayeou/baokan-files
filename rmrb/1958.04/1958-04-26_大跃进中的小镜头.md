Small Vignettes of the Great Leap Forward

    "A Pair of Auspicious Pigs"

    In the middle of the night, a wind suddenly rose, and the treetops outside the house whistled sharply. Zhang Guilian, a female member of the Tanggou Agricultural Cooperative in Guanyun County, was awakened from her sleep, rubbed her eyes, and scrambled up, throwing on her clothes and running outside.

    "Guilian, it's not dawn yet, what are you getting up to! It's cold, don't catch a cold!" her mother-in-law, awakened by the sound of the door opening, called out repeatedly.

    "The wind's up, I'm going to check on the pigs..." Guilian's words were drowned out by the wind outside.

    The icy wind, sharp as a knife, drilled straight into one's bones. Guilian ran to the pigsty and saw two piglets huddled in their nest, shivering and squealing. Guilian turned around, pulled a large bundle of grass from a pile, jumped into the pigsty, and stuffed the grass into the pig nest. The piglets burrowed into the thick grass and soon fell into a sweet sleep.

    Why did Guilian love these two piglets so much? There's a story behind it:

    Guilian's husband, Cao Hengluan, is a worker at the Xinhailian Printing Factory in Xinhailian City. They only got married in January of this year. To prepare for the wedding, Cao Hengluan had been busy saving money for half a year. By the time of the wedding, he had saved fifty-six yuan, which he had originally planned to use to buy new clothes and host a feast. However, after the Double Anti Movement began, he suddenly changed his mind. At the wedding, he neither made new clothes nor held a banquet, and this money was saved. After the two of them discussed it, they went the next day and bought a pair of Yorkshire piglets. People called this pair of piglets "auspicious pigs," and Guilian had guaranteed to Cao Hengluan that she would feed this pair of pigs until they were big and fat. Therefore, she showed them special care at all times.

    Zhang Jimin, a Demobilized Soldier, Invests in Purchasing a Water Pump

    Zhang Jimin, a civil servant of the Fifth District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, is a demobilized soldier who had only recently arrived. His home is located in the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative, not far from the District Committee. Some time ago, the cooperative's cadres held a meeting to discuss water conservancy construction, and he also participated. At the meeting, someone suggested that if the large pond in Paomu Bay could be utilized, it could turn hundreds of acres of dry land into paddy fields. However, this pond is located in a mountain depression, surrounded by rocky mountains, and it would be necessary to cut through the valley to draw the water out, which would be a considerable undertaking. Some people suggested buying a water pump to pump the water out, but there was no money to buy one. Others suggested applying for a loan from the state. While the discussion was ongoing, Zhang Jimin's thoughts were engaged in a fierce struggle. He had 1,400 yuan in savings in the bank, which he had saved little by little since joining the army in 1953 and marching into Tibet, and he planned to use it to build a house and get married and settle down. At this time, he thought that his family had been farm laborers for three generations before liberation, and had never had so much money. If it hadn't been for liberation, wouldn't they still be suffering? Now that the cooperative needs money, he can't just think of himself. He said to everyone, "I have more than a thousand yuan in the bank, and I can invest it all in water conservancy construction."

    Currently, the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative has already ordered a water pump. When the water pump arrives, it can be used to pump water from the large pond in Paomu Bay to irrigate the surrounding hundreds of acres of land, and increase grain production by more than 200,000 catties each year.

    大跃进中的小镜头
    “一对喜猪”
    夜半，陡然起了风，屋外的树梢被吹得发出了尖锐的呼啸声。正在熟睡的灌云县塘沟农业社女社员张桂莲，从梦中被惊醒，揉了揉眼，一骨碌爬了起来，披上衣服就往外跑。
    “桂莲，天还没亮，起来干啥呀！冷哟，不要受凉啊！”被开门声惊醒的婆婆连声叫着。
      “起风了，看看猪子去……”桂莲的话被屋外的大风淹没了。
    刀尖似的寒风，直往人的骨头里钻。桂莲跑到猪圈边一看，两只小猪正伏在窝里颤抖地叫唤着。桂莲转身在草堆上扒了一大捆草，跳进猪圈，就将草塞进了猪窝，小猪钻在厚厚的草里，一会儿，就甜甜地睡起觉来。
    桂莲为什么特别心爱这两只小猪呢？原来这里面有一段故事：
    桂莲的爱人曹恒峦是新海连市新海印刷厂的工人，他们是在今年1月才结婚的。为了办喜事，曹恒峦半年前就忙着攒钱了，到结婚时，已攒得五十六块钱，本来是准备拿这些钱来买新衣服和请客吃饭的。可是，双反运动开始以后，他忽然变了主意，结婚时，既没有做新衣服，酒也没有办，这一笔钱便省了下来。他们两个一商量，第二天就去买来了一对约克夏小猪，人们都把这一对小猪喊做“喜猪”，桂莲曾向曹恒峦提过保证：一定要把这一对小猪喂得又肥又大。因此，不管什么时候，她对这一对猪表现得特别关心。
    转业军人张纪民投资购买抽水机
    贵州省金沙县第五区中共区委会公务员张纪民，是一个刚来不久的转业军人。他的家就住在离区委会不远的“五一”农业社里。前些日子，社干部们开会研究兴修水利，他也参加了。会上有人提出，泡木湾那口大堰塘，如果利用起来，可以把几百亩旱地变成水田。只是这口大堰塘坐落在山凹里，四周都是石头山，必须打穿山谷才能把水引出来，工程相当大。有人主张买架抽水机，把水抽出来，但是没有钱买。有人主张向国家贷款。正在议论纷纷的时候，张纪民的思想展开了激烈的斗争。原来他有一千四百元存款存在银行里，是他从1953年参军以后，进军西藏，一点一滴储蓄起来的，他打算用它来修房子和结婚、安家。这时他想，自己家里解放前三辈当长工，哪有过这么多钱。要不是解放了，还不是照样受苦。现在合作社正需要钱用，不能只顾自己不顾社。他就对大家说：“我在银行里存有一千多元，可以全部投资修水利。”
    目前，“五一”农业社已经订购了一部抽水机。等抽水机运来了，就可以抽泡木湾大堰塘的水来灌溉周围的几百亩地，以后每年可以增产粮食二十多万斤。（附图片）
