    North Vietnam victoriously concludes its economic recovery period
    Huang Song, Editor-in-Chief of Vietnam's "People's Daily"
    On January 1, 1958, President Ho Chi Minh, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, delivered a New Year's greeting to the people of the whole country, saying: "The new year has arrived, the post-war economic recovery period has ended, and the period of planned economic development has begun."
    For all the people of our country, especially for the working class, peasantry, and intellectual workers who are bravely overcoming all difficulties to build socialism in North Vietnam, the above words contain much meaning.
    The working people of our country clearly see the difficulties encountered by the motherland in its growth, but they are also deeply aware of the new and noteworthy changes brought about in social life by past efforts, and they have also laid the foundation for even greater and more fundamental new changes in the future. Looking at the map of North Vietnam north of the 17th parallel, we can also see the general nature of these new changes: the vast uninhabited areas that once spread over 130,000 hectares when the war first ended have today become boundless fields. The irrigated area has now increased by hundreds of thousands of hectares compared to before the war. The old factories and mines have been almost completely restored and partially expanded. Fifteen newly built enterprises, such as the Cao Bang Tin Factory, the Hanoi Machine Manufacturing Factory, the Vinh City Power Plant, and the Bac Ninh Match Factory, have been established. Thus, the total number of state-owned enterprises in our country has increased from 18 during the war of resistance to 78 by the end of 1957, greatly exceeding the number of enterprises during French rule. In terms of transportation, our country has restored 553 kilometers of railways and more than 32,000 kilometers of highways that were severely damaged by the war, and newly built 583 kilometers of highways and 12,000 kilometers of telephone lines. 937 kilometers of coastal sea routes and 4,612 kilometers of waterways have been dredged, and more than 5 million cubic meters of earth and stone have been excavated in inland waterways and various ports.
    But the problem is not just to restore the old production base, but to restore the pre-war production level (taking 1939 as the standard). Because the aim is to stabilize the economic situation, improve the lives of the working people, and create conditions for further planned economic development. In this regard, the greatest victory of our people is that as early as the second year after peace – 1955 – rice production increased by about 1,193,000 tons compared to 1939, and in 1956 it increased by another 532,000 tons (Note). In 1957, despite the prolonged drought, rice production decreased by only 180,000 tons compared to 1956.
    The output of some economic crops such as corn, cotton, jute, ramie, and sugarcane has also exceeded the pre-war level. In terms of industry, although the total output value of coal, cement, etc. is about 65% of that in 1939, other important products have either caught up with or exceeded the level of that year. For example, in the textile industry, only 20 million meters of cotton cloth and 9,000 tons of yarn could be produced in 1939. In 1957, 27.2 million meters of cotton cloth and 9,500 tons of yarn were produced. Although the various newly built power plants have only partially been put into production, the power output supplied by the electricity sector has now exceeded the level during French rule. In addition to industrial products, there are also huge amounts of commodities produced by small industrial sectors and nearly 500,000 handicraft workers (in 1939 there were about 160,000 handicraft workers).
    The relatively rapid recovery of agriculture, industry, handicrafts, and transportation has laid a major material foundation for gradually stabilizing the economy and improving the people's lives. With this foundation, coupled with the goods supplied by fraternal countries in the socialist camp in terms of exchange of goods and assistance, which enriched our country's material strength, we have been able to effectively stabilize prices and stabilize the market.
    As early as 1955, the prices of major consumer goods such as rice, cloth, salt, and paper were basically stable. Although market management work has encountered many difficulties in the past three years, and sometimes the prices of certain commodities could not be kept reasonable, by the beginning of this year, during the Spring Festival, the commercial departments had summed up very meaningful figures: the price level in January 1958 decreased by 9% compared to January 1957. Last year's Spring Festival saw only more than ten kinds of commodities with stable prices, this year it has increased to one hundred kinds. Comparing this year's Spring Festival with last year's: pork prices dropped by 25%, tobacco prices dropped by 65%, and various candies and pastries also dropped by 20% to 50%.
    Due to these efforts, the difficulties in the lives of the working people have gradually decreased. Farmers have sufficient food, and they also have the conditions to build houses and add agricultural tools and household goods. In various cities and industrial areas, 140,000 unemployed people left over from the old system have now been employed. The state has also built 84,649 square meters of workers' housing and hundreds of medical clinics.
    The task of economic recovery in North Vietnam has been basically and victoriously completed in three aspects: restoring the old production base, restoring the pre-war production level, and stabilizing the lives of the broad masses of working people. Like any other country in the socialist camp, our country's economic recovery is not limited to restoring projects destroyed by the war, but has already moved in a new direction from the beginning, combining economic recovery with the transformation of the national economy. When carrying out the task of economic recovery, our country has strived to complete land reform in the countryside, liberating the productive forces of more than 10 million farmers, and recovering 895,000 hectares of land and 100,070 head of livestock for farmers. In the past, an average of about 626,500 tons of grain per year were paid to landlords in the form of rent, but now it all belongs to the farmers. At the same time, we have also begun to carry out the historical task of transitioning to socialism – initially transforming the economy of North Vietnam along the socialist road.
    At present, the "who will win" struggle between the rapidly developing socialist economy and the capitalist economy, which still has a foundation in the capitalist economy and in the extremely broad small-scale individual economy, has become increasingly prominent and acute. We can say that in the past three years, the socialist economy has achieved preliminary and certain victories in this struggle, otherwise it would not have been possible for the economic recovery to achieve the above achievements.
    Today, for our country's economy, a matter of great significance is that the socialist economy has long been born and has developed rapidly since the restoration of peace. As early as when North Vietnam was just liberated, the people's democratic government had already controlled all the banks, railways, and foreign trade departments, and transformed various large enterprises of French colonialism, such as the Hong Gai Coal Mine, the Nam Dinh Textile Factory, and the Hai Phong Cement Plant, into public property of the whole people. The socialist commercial system began to sprout as early as during the war of resistance. In the past three years, this industry has developed from 447 retail outlets to 14 industries, 657 retail outlets, and 315 mobile sales units. As of 1957, the socialist economy accounted for 21.8% of the total output value of industry and handicrafts; 26.9% of the total retail sales and 52% of the total wholesale sales. Although the above figures are not large, this young and dynamic economic force has maintained its leading position in the national economy. Relying on this force, the people's democratic government gradually restricts the role of capitalist economic laws, promotes the formation of a semi-socialist economy, and opens up the road for rapid development of production. As of 1957, 44 agricultural production cooperatives and 84,000 mutual aid teams have been organized in the countryside, showing a beautiful prospect for the agricultural collectivization movement. In terms of handicrafts, the organized part (whose organizational form is collective production teams) has accounted for 11.4% of the number of producers and 14.4% of the total output value. Supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in 3,000 villages in 21 provinces and cities, with a total of 1,238,000 members; accounting for 5.9% of the total retail sales. In the struggle for the victory of the new economic system, this semi-socialist economic form is an increasingly powerful assistant to the socialist economy. The capitalist economy has also been initially transformed, and a part of it has embarked on the path of state capitalism, in a lower form, such as processing orders in industry and agency distribution in commerce.
    Although the private capitalist economy and the small-scale individual economy are still large at present, the above-mentioned political and economic conditions guarantee that our country's economy can achieve planning. The national plans for 1956 and 1957 have been implemented well, and many departments, factories, and mines have overfulfilled the plans.
    The good results achieved by the Vietnamese people in their economic recovery over the past three years are due to the correct line and policies implemented by the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam: focusing on the development of agricultural production, while attaching importance to the production of industry and handicrafts, and using commerce as an important link to promote and regulate all economic activities, and adopting appropriate measures to utilize and transform the private capitalist economy, in order to establish and develop the socialist economy and the semi-socialist economy as soon as possible. Whether in the economic recovery line or in the annual national plan, the work of improving the lives of the working people is still regarded as one of the important tasks.
    This correct line has mobilized the broad masses of working people to carry out production competitions with full confidence, practice thrift, participate in economic management, and strive to thoroughly implement the country's various economic and financial policies.
    When our people talk about their achievements in economic recovery, they will never forget the full assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries in the socialist camp in terms of cadres, technology, machinery, and commodities.
    This year, our country has begun a new period - the period of planned economic and cultural development - by unveiling the prelude to the three-year plan of 1958-1960. On the road to socialism, there are still many difficulties and hardships ahead of us, but the favorable conditions are still fundamental. In the past three years, we have not only created the necessary material foundation, but also accumulated some experience. At the same time, we have made a certain degree of progress in terms of ideology, organization, technology, and economic management, which will enable us to move forward with magnificent strides in the future. In the overall progress of the socialist camp from victory to victory, the Vietnamese people are confident that they will be able to satisfactorily realize the first plan for the transition to socialism.

    Note: Rice production in 1939 was 2,407,000 tons (according to French statistics), 3,600,000 tons in 1955, and 4,132,000 tons in 1956.

    越南北方胜利地结束了恢复经济时期
    越南“人民报”总编辑　黄松
    1958年1月1日，胡志明主席代表越南劳动党中央委员会和越南民主共和国政府向全国人民致新年祝词时说：“新的一年来到了，战后恢复经济时期已经结束了，有计划地发展经济的时期已经开始了。”
    对于我国全体人民，尤其是对于那些正在勇敢地克服一切困难来建设越南北方的社会主义的工人阶级、农民阶级和脑力劳动者来说，上面这几句话里包含着很多意义。
    我国的劳动人民清楚地看到祖国在成长中所遇到的困难，但是他们也深深地了解到在社会生活中，由于过去的努力而带来了新的、值得提出的变化，并且还为将来更巨大更基本的新的变化打下基础。试看一下十七度线以北的越南北方的版图，我们也可看到这种新变化的一般：在战争刚停止时一度蔓延十三万公顷以上的辽阔的无人区，今天已变成一望无际的田野。现在灌溉面积比战前增加了成十万公顷。旧有的工厂、矿山几乎完全恢复和部分扩建了。十五项新建企业如高平锡厂、河内机器制造厂、荣市发电厂、北宁火柴厂等都已诞生，这样，我国国营企业的总数已由抗战时期的十八项增加到截至1957年底的七十八项，大大地超过法国统治时期的企业数量。在交通运输方面，我国已恢复了受战争惨重破坏的铁路五百五十三公里、公路三万二千多公里并新修公路五百八十三公里、电话线一万二千公里。疏浚了沿海海路九百三十七公里和水路四千六百十二公里，在内河航路和各个港口中共施工五百多万土方和石方。
    但是问题并不在于恢复旧有的生产基础，而在于恢复战前的生产水平（以1939年为标准）。因为目的在于稳定经济状况，改善劳动人民的生活，并为进一步有计划地发展经济而创造条件。在这方面，我国人民最大的胜利，是早在和平后第二年——1955年稻米的产量就比1939年增加了约一百一十九万三千吨，1956年又增加了五十三万二千吨（注）。1957年，尽管旱灾延长，但稻米的产量比1956年只减少十八万吨。
    一些经济作物如玉蜀黍、棉花、黄麻、苎麻、甘蔗的产量也已超过战前的水平。在工业方面，虽然煤、水泥等的总产值约达1939年的65％，但是其他重要产品或已赶上或已超过当年的水平。例如在纺织业方面，在1939年只能生产棉布二千万公尺、纱九千吨。1957年所生产的棉布达二千七百二十万公尺、纱九千五百吨。虽然各个刚兴建的发电厂只有部分投入生产，可是现在电力部门所供给的电力产量也已超过法国统治时期的水平。除工业产品以外，还有由小工业各部门和将近五十万手工业工人（1939年手工业工人约有十六万人）所生产出来的巨额商品。
    农业、工业、手工业和交通运输都恢复得相当的迅速，这就为逐渐稳定经济和改善人民生活打下了主要的物质基础。有了这个基础，再加上社会主义阵营中各兄弟国家在交流货物和援助方面所供应的货物充实了我国的物资力量，就使我们能够有效地进行平稳物价和平稳市场。
    早在1955年，主要消费品米、布、盐、纸等的价格基本上已经稳定。三年来的市场管理工作虽曾碰到许多困难，有时某种商品的价格不能保持合理，但是到今年年初，在春节时，商业部门已总结出很有意义的数字：1958年1月的物价比1957年1月下降9％。去年春节，价格能够保持平稳的商品只有十多种，今年已增加到一百种。以今年春节和去年春节比较：猪肉降价25％，烟草降价65％，各种糖果和糕饼也降价20％至50％。
    由于这些努力，劳动人民在生活上的困难已经逐渐减少，农民有了充足的粮食，而且还有条件修筑住宅、增置农具和家用品。在各个城市和工业区中，由旧制度所遗下的失业者十四万人，今天已经就业。国家还建设了八万四千六百四十九平方公尺的工人住宅和成百间的医疗处所。
    越南北方恢复经济的任务，已经在恢复旧有的生产基础、恢复战前的生产水平和安定广大劳动人民的生活这三方面胜利地基本上完成了。和社会主义阵营中任何其他国家一样，我国恢复经济的事业不仅仅限于恢复已被战争破坏的工程，而早在开头时就已朝向新的方向，结合经济的恢复来改造国民经济。当执行恢复经济任务时，我国已争取完成在农村中的土地改革，解放了一千多万农民的生产力，为农民夺回土地八十九万五千公顷、耕畜十万零七千头。过去平均每年约有六十二万六千五百吨谷以地租的形式纳给地主，而现在全归农民所有了。同时我们还开始执行进入社会主义的过渡时期的历史任务——沿着社会主义的道路初步改造我国北方的经济。
    目前，正在迅速发展的社会主义经济，同在资本主义经济中和在极其广泛的小生产个体经济中还拥有基础的资本主义经济展开的“谁战胜谁”的斗争，已日益显著和尖锐起来。我们可以说：在过去三年中，社会主义经济在这一斗争中已取得初步的、一定程度的胜利，否则恢复经济事业就不可能取得以上的成就。
    今天，对于我国经济来说，一件具有重大意义的事情是社会主义经济早已诞生，并且自从和平恢复后就迅速地发展起来。早在越南北方刚刚解放的时候，人民民主政府就已掌握了全部银行、铁路、对外贸易这些部门，并且把法国殖民主义的各个大企业，如鸿基煤矿、南定纺织厂、海防水泥厂等都变成全民公共的财产。社会主义商业系统早在抗战时期开始萌芽，三年来，这一种行业已由四百四十七个门市部，发展到十四种行业、六百五十七个门市部和三百一十五个巡回售货单位。截至1957年为止，社会主义经济已占工业和手工业总产值的21.8％；占市场零售总额的26.9％和批发总额的52％。上述的数字虽不算大，但这种年轻而富有活力的经济力量已经保持自己在国民经济中的领导地位。人民民主政府依靠这种力量，逐渐限制资本主义经济规律的作用，并促进半社会主义经济的形成，为迅速发展生产开辟了道路。截至1957年为止，四十四个农业生产合作社和八万四千个变工组已在农村中组织起来，为农业合作化运动显示了美丽的前景。在手工业方面，有组织的部分（其组织形式是集体生产组）已占生产人数的11．4％和占总产值的14.4％。供销合作社已在二十一个省、市的三千个乡村中建立起来，共拥有社员一百二十三万八千人；占零售总额的5.9％。在为新经济制度的胜利的斗争中，这种半社会主义的经济形式就是社会主义经济日益得力的助手。资本主义经济也初步得到改造，其中有一部分已走上国家资本主义的道路，其形式较低，如工业中的加工订货，商业中的代理经销。
    尽管目前私营资本主义经济和小生产个体经济还很大，但是有了上述的政治和经济条件，就保证了我国的经济能够实现计划化。1956年和1957年的国家计划都实现得很好，而且有许多部门和厂矿已超额完成计划。
    三年来越南人民的恢复经济事业能够取得良好的结果，是由于越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府执行了正确的路线和政策：以发展农业生产为主，同时重视工业和手工业的生产，并且以商业作为重要的环节以推进和调节经济的全部活动，对私营资本主义经济采取适当的利用、改造的措施，以早日适应地建立并发展社会主义经济和半社会主义经济，无论在恢复经济的路线上或是在一年的国家计划中，改善劳动人民生活的工作仍旧被视为重要的任务之一。
    这种正确的路线已经动员广大的劳动人民信心百倍地进行生产竞赛，实行节约，参加经济管理工作，并为彻底实施国家的各项经济财政政策而奋斗。
    当我国人民谈到自己恢复经济的成就的时候，永远不会忘记苏联、中国和社会主义阵营中其他兄弟国家在干部、技术、机械、商品各方面的全力援助。
    今年，我国由于揭开1958—1960年三年计划的序幕而开始踏上新的时期——有计划地发展经济和文化时期。在走向社会主义的道路上，出现在我们面前的困难和艰苦还很多，但是顺利的条件依然是基本的。在过去三年中，我们不但创造了必要的物质基础，而且还积累了一些经验。同时在思想、组织、技术、经济管理各方面都有了一定程度的进步，今后就有可能迈开豪壮的步伐前进了。在从胜利走向胜利的社会主义阵营总的前进步伐中，越南人民深信自己将能美满地实现进入社会主义的过渡时期的头一个计划。
