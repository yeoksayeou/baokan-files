    The first National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation opened in Beijing on the 30th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement in 1949. Participating in the congress were 480 representatives of patriotic youth from all strata, regions, democratic parties, different religious beliefs, and ethnic groups. Convening a national youth representative congress with such broad representation was a first in Chinese history. This congress realized the long-cherished wish of Chinese youth for democratic unity and was one of the important fruits of the revolutionary movement led by the Chinese Communist Party.
    The first National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation summarized the experiences of the Chinese youth movement over the past thirty years, especially the achievements of the youth movement in the Chinese People's Liberation War, and formulated a new direction for the Chinese youth movement. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party stated in its congratulatory message to the congress that the basic task of Chinese youth under the new situation at that time was: "In addition to continuing to wage a resolute struggle against imperialist aggressors and the remnants of Chinese counter-revolutionaries, we must place our main efforts on the tasks of learning and construction, so as to rapidly restore and develop industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings throughout China, so that the Chinese people, who have won military and political victories, can also achieve equally great victories in the economic and cultural fields." Based on the suggestion of the Youth Federation of the Liberated Areas, this congress established the All-China Democratic Youth Federation.
    The second National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation was convened under the situation where our country had concluded the work of restoring the national economy and had begun to enter a period of planned construction. This congress was held in Beijing from June 10 to 15, 1953, with 560 representatives attending the congress. The task of the congress was to determine the direction of efforts for the youth of New China in the new historical period of building the motherland, mobilize the broad masses of youth from all strata and ethnic groups to actively participate in the construction of the motherland, strive to learn science and technology, continuously improve their political awareness, and serve the motherland more effectively. This congress decided to change the name of the "All-China Democratic Youth Federation" to the "All-China Youth Federation."

    中华全国青年第一次和第二次代表大会
    中华全国青年第一次代表大会，是在1949年“五四”运动三十周年纪念日在北京开幕的。参加大会的，有各阶层、各地区、各民主党派、各不同宗教信仰和各民族中的爱国青年代表四百八十人。召开具有这样广泛代表性的全国青年代表大会，在中国历史上是第一次。这次大会实现了中国青年久已盼望的民主团结的愿望，是中国共产党领导的革命运动的重要果实之一。
    中华全国青年第一次代表大会总结了三十年来中国青年运动的经验，特别是中国人民解放战争中青年运动的成就，制定了中国青年运动的新方针。中国共产党中央委员会给这次大会的贺电指出，在当时新形势下中国青年的基本任务是：“除了必须继续与帝国主义侵略者及中国反革命残余作坚决斗争以外，必须把主要的努力放在学习和建设的任务方面，以便迅速在全中国恢复和发展工农业生产和文化教育事业，使军事上和政治上胜利了的中国人民，在经济上和文化上也得到同样伟大的胜利。”这次大会根据解放区青年联合会的建议，建立了中华全国民主青年联合会总会。
    中华全国青年第二次代表大会是在我国已经结束国民经济的恢复工作，开始进入有计划的建设时期的形势下召开的。这次大会于1953年6月10日到15日在北京举行，出席大会的代表有五百六十人。大会的任务是确定新中国青年在建设祖国的新的历史时期中的努力方向，动员各阶层、各民族的广大青年积极参加祖国建设事业，努力学习科学技术，不断提高政治觉悟，更有效地为祖国服务。这次大会决定将“中华全国民主青年联合会总会”更名为“中华全国民主青年联合会”。
