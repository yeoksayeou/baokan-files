Let Subtropical Crops Develop in a Great Leap Forward
    Fujian to Widely Plant Sugar Cane, Hemp, Fruits, and Oil Crops; Hainan Island to Support with Seeds and Seedlings

    (Our Dispatch) The Fujian Daily reports: Fujian Province has decided to vigorously develop subtropical crops such as sugarcane, hemp, fruits, oil crops, and spices. It requires that within five years, the area of subtropical crops in the province be expanded from the current one million mu to 8.1 million mu. By 1962, the output value of the portion put into production will reach 570 million yuan (after the fruit trees mature and are all put into production, the total output value can reach 1.35 billion yuan). Achieving this plan will greatly change Fujian Province's economic landscape.

    About 25 counties and cities in southeastern coastal Fujian Province are located in subtropical zones, suitable for developing tropical and subtropical crops. Therefore, it has been decided that while focusing on developing grain crops in rural areas of southern Fujian, vigorous efforts will be made to develop subtropical and economic crops. Preliminary plans call for developing 2 million mu of sugarcane, 1.5 million mu of agave (including sisal), 200,000 mu of jute, 50,000 mu of sea island cotton, 1.5 million mu of citrus, 1 million mu of longan, 500,000 mu of lychee, 600,000 mu of pineapple, 100,000 mu of banana, 80,000 mu of pomelo, 150,000 mu of loquat, 300,000 mu of other fruits, 30,000 mu of rubber, 50,000 mu of coffee, and 40,000 mu of avocado within five years.

    In order to effectively ensure the smooth realization of the above plan, relevant departments have begun to arrange the comprehensive utilization of land. It has been determined that sugarcane and jute will be mainly developed in the Longxi and Jinjiang special districts; agave and sisal and sea island cotton will mainly be planted in coastal counties using hilly slopes and reclaimed land; rubber, coffee, avocado, and various fruit trees will be developed primarily in near-mountain, low-mountain, and good-mountain areas below 30 degrees in the Longxi and Jinjiang special districts. Among these, rubber and coffee have higher requirements for climatic conditions and will therefore be given priority in areas with superior environments; spices will mainly be developed in conjunction with the beautification and perfuming of cities, industrial and mining enterprises, schools, and streets. The land required for cultivating various crops will be mainly opened up and run as state-owned farms with national investment, while agricultural cooperatives will also be appropriately organized to cultivate and plant on reclaimed land. It is planned to first reclaim 500,000 mu in the coastal hilly areas in 1958, and complete the reclamation task of 4.2 million mu by 1962. In solving the problem of seeds and seedlings, we must resolutely implement the principle of self-reliance in seedling cultivation, with agricultural cooperatives mainly breeding and planting their own, supplemented by national investment in establishing nurseries. In the first half of this year, 13 million fruit seedlings will be propagated using high-pressure rapid seedling breeding methods. To meet the technical needs of the great development of subtropical production, Fujian Province will strengthen and expand scientific and technological research institutions. In addition to improving the existing Xiamen and Zhangpu Subtropical Crop Experimental Farms and the Longxi, Nanjing, Huaan, and Yongchun trial planting stations, it is also planned to establish a Subtropical Crop Research Institute and a Sugarcane Production Experimental Station in southern Fujian this year, and to establish specialized farms for various crops in the main producing areas to strengthen experimental research, solve major technical problems in production, and ensure the leap-forward development of subtropical crop production.

    (Our Dispatch) The first batch of 38 tons of tropical and subtropical crop seeds and seedlings from Hainan Island supporting Fujian Province has arrived at Xiazhai, Zhangpu, Fujian.

    Among these seeds and seedlings are abaca, sisal, oil palm, coconut, coffee, and cocoa. In addition, there are also precious spices such as pepper and citronella; high-yielding, excellent feed such as Japanese squash and short sword beans. There are also more than ten kinds of excellent green manure cover crops with great soil improvement effects, such as Malay trailing beans, butterfly beans, and Yazhou flat beans.

    让亚热带作物大发展大跃进
    福建将广种蔗麻水果油料　海南岛支援种子种苗
    本报讯　福建日报报道：福建省决定大力发展甘蔗、麻类、水果、油料、香料等亚热带作物，要求五年内全省亚热带作物的面积从现有的一百万亩发展到八百一十万亩，到1962年投入生产部分的产值将达五亿七千多元（果木成林，全部投入生产后，总产值可达十三亿五千多元）。实现这个规划，将使福建省经济面貌大大改观。
    福建省东南沿海约有二十五个县市地处亚热带，适宜发展热带、亚热带作物。因此，决定闽南地区农村以发展粮食作物为主的同时，大力发展亚热带作物和经济作物。初步计划五年内发展甘蔗二百万亩、龙舌兰麻（包括剑麻）一百五十万亩、黄麻二十万亩、海岛棉五万亩、柑桔一百五十万亩、龙眼一百万亩、荔枝五十万亩、菠萝六十万亩、香蕉十万亩、柚子八万亩、枇杷十五万亩、其他果类三十万亩，橡胶三万亩，咖啡五万亩，油梨四万亩。
    为了切实保证上述规划的顺利实现，有关部门已着手安排综合利用土地问题。确定甘蔗、黄麻主要在龙溪、晋江两专区发展；龙舌兰麻、剑麻、海岛棉主要在沿海县份利用丘陵坡地和海滩围垦地种植；橡胶、咖啡、油梨以及多种果树着重在龙溪、晋江两专区三十度以下的近山、低山、好山发展。其中，橡胶、咖啡对于气候条件要求较高，因而要在环境优越的地区优先发展；香料主要是结合城市、工矿、企业、学校、街道美化、香化发展。栽培各项作物所需的土地以国家投资开荒兴办国营农场为主，同时适当组织农业社垦荒种植，计划1958年先在沿海丘陵地带垦荒五十万亩；到1962年完成四百二十万亩的垦荒任务。在解决种苗问题上坚决贯彻自力更生的育苗方针，以农业社自育自种为主，国家投资建立苗圃为辅，今年上半年就要用高压快速育苗法繁殖果苗一千三百万株。为适应亚热带生产大发展的技术需要，福建省将充实壮大科学技术研究机构，除提高现有厦门、漳浦亚热带作物试验场和龙溪、南靖、华安、永春等试种站外，还计划今年在闽南成立亚热带作物研究所和甘蔗生产试验站，并分别在主产地区建立各项作物的专业场，以加强试验研究，解决生产技术上的重大问题，保证亚热带作物生产飞跃发展。
    本报讯　海南岛支援福建省的热带、亚热带作物种子和种苗第一批三十八吨已运抵福建漳浦下寨。
    在这批种子、苗木中有蕉麻、剑麻、油棕、椰子、咖啡、可可。此外还有珍贵的香料胡椒和香茅；有高产的优良饲料日本瓜和短刀豆。还有具有很大改良土壤效力的优良绿肥复盖作物马来毛蔓豆、蝴蝶豆和崖州扁豆等十余种。
