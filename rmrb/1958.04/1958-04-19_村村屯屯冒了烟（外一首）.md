Villages and hamlets are ablaze with activity, everyone is working joyously!
They work from morning till night, turning the night into day!
Lanterns and torches shine everywhere, the resounding songs shake the sky!
We command the rocks to bow their heads, we command the river to flow backwards!
We work hard day and night, determined to transform nature!

Spring Wind and Snowy Night

Thousands of lights, tens of thousands of lights,
Thousands and tens of thousands of lights shine brightly near and far,
Villages and hamlets are not quiet,
The sound of wheels turns all night long.
A burst of snow, a gust of wind,
The wind and snow never stop,
We strive for the top with surging enthusiasm,
The clouds are dark, but the flags are red.

    村村屯屯冒了烟（外一首）
    井岩盾村村屯屯冒了烟，人人个个干得欢！白天从早干到晚，夜晚变成大白天！灯笼火把遍地明，歌声嘹喨震破天！岩石叫它低下头，河水叫它往回转！苦干大战日连夜，坚决改造大自然！
    春季风雪夜千盏灯，万盏灯，千灯万灯远近明，村村屯屯不安静，彻夜车轮声。一阵雪，一阵风，风雪阵阵不消停，力争上游干劲猛，云黑旗帜红。
