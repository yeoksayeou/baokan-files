(Xinhua News Agency) The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has allocated more than 120,000 yuan this spring to establish the first local state-owned deer farm in the Nanmu Oroqen Ethnic Township of Butha Banner in the Greater Khingan Mountains.

　　The deer farm plans to raise 750 deer within five years. It will first raise and breed red deer from the Greater Khingan Mountains and sika deer from the Northeast, and then gradually increase the types of breeding, raising rare wild animals such as reindeer (Elaphurus davidianus), Cervus canadensis xanthopygus, and roe deer.
