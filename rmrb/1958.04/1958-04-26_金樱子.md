Rosa laevigata, also known as thorn pear, mountain pomegranate, mountain chicken head, ding lang, etc., is an evergreen shrub that blooms in May and June, and bears fruit after flowering. The fruit resembles a young pomegranate, maturing in September and October, appearing yellow-red and covered with dense hairs. It is distributed throughout southern China. According to tests in Fujian Province, the fresh fruit contains starch and sugar, which can be used for brewing wine and making sugar. Rosa laevigata also contains malic acid and citric acid, and can be used for medicinal purposes. In the past, with the exception of a very small portion used in traditional Chinese medicine, most of it was discarded in the mountains and fields. In recent years, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces have successfully used Rosa laevigata for brewing wine and making sugar. Every 100 jin of Rosa laevigata can produce about 25 jin of 50-proof white wine; every 100 jin of Rosa laevigata can produce more than 23 jin of sugar. Now Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei and other places have begun to purchase and utilize this wild resource in large quantities. Hunan Province alone purchased 100,000 dan in 1957, which, if used for winemaking, could produce 25,000 dan of wine.

    金樱子
    金樱子别称刺梨子、山石榴、山鸡头子、丁榔等，是一种常绿小灌木，五、六月间开花，花后结果，形似石榴幼果，九、十月间成熟，呈黄红色，外生密毛，分布在我国南方各地。据福建省化验鲜果，含有淀粉和糖，可以酿酒和制糖。金樱子还含有苹果酸、柠檬酸，可作药用。过去除极少部分用作中药外，大部分废弃在山野。近年来，四川、湖北、湖南、江西、福建等省用金樱子酿酒、制糖成功，每百斤金樱子可产五十度白酒二十五斤左右；每百斤金樱子可产糖二十三斤多。现湖南、江西、湖北等地已大量收购和利用这种野生资源。仅湖南一省1957年就收购了十万担，如果用来制酒，可产酒二万五千担。
