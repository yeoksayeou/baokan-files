    Do Not Simply Stimulate the Masses to Eliminate the Four Pests Through Economic Means

    Some places have adopted economic methods to stimulate the masses to eliminate the four pests. For example, several agricultural cooperatives in Hengxi Township, Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province, in order to encourage the masses to eliminate the four pests and make the entire township and cooperative "four-free" as quickly as possible, have adopted a work point system. If a cooperative member eliminates a sparrow, the cooperative rewards him with one labor work point; the Jintou Agricultural Cooperative even stipulates a reward of five labor work points for eliminating one sparrow. Although the enthusiasm of the masses for eliminating the four pests has increased since this method was implemented, the result has brought some disadvantages. First, the masses cannot truly understand the significance of eliminating the four pests and develop the erroneous idea of eliminating the four pests only for work points; second, because work points can be obtained for eliminating the four pests, some cooperative members do not engage in agricultural production and spend all day eliminating the four pests, which seriously affects agricultural production.

    I believe that material rewards can be appropriately given to those who actively eliminate the four pests, but simply adopting the practice of recording work points is incorrect. Shou Cun

    不要单纯从经济上刺激群众除四害
    有的地方采取了用经济办法来刺激群众去消灭四害的办法。例如，浙江省临安县横溪乡的几个农业社，为了叫群众消灭四害，更快地使全乡、全社成为“四无”乡、社，采取了给工分的办法，社员消灭一只麻雀，社里给他记一个劳动工分的报酬；金头农业社还规定消灭一只麻雀给予五个劳动工分的报酬。虽然这个办法规定之后，群众除四害的劲头比以前提高了，但是，这样做的结果，带来了一些害处，首先群众不能真正认识到除四害的意义，产生了一种为了工分而才去除四害的错误思想；其次，因为除四害可得到工分，所以有些社员就不去搞农业生产而整天去除四害，严重地影响了农业生产。
    我认为，对于积极除四害的人，可以适当地给予物质奖励，但是单纯采取记工分的做法是不对的。　守寸
