Rapidly Popularize Hybrid Corn Seeds
Ke Rang

Planting hybrid corn seeds leads to significant yield increases, which has been fully proven in production practice. In Licheng, Shandong, the promotion of "Fangza No. 2" increased yields by about 100 jin per mu. In Junan County, more than 100,000 mu were planted, increasing grain production by more than 6 million jin. Currently, China has 97 hybrid varieties. In the major corn-producing provinces such as Shandong, Shanxi, and Henan, there are hybrid combinations suitable for local promotion. These varieties generally increase yields by about 50 jin per mu. Based on this situation, hybrid corn seeds should be quickly popularized, but the opposite is true. From 1952 to 1957, in six years, only about one million mu were promoted nationwide, accounting for only 4/1000 of the 230 million mu of corn planting area, a very slow pace.

Why is it so slow? The main reason is that some technicians and leaders have serious conservative ideas. Some technicians do not trust the masses, believing that the masses cannot master such "complex" technology and that only relying on experimental research institutions and specialized breeding farms to prepare hybrid seeds can guarantee quality. But that is not the case. The Party has long told us that as long as we truly rely on the masses and mobilize them, there will be a solution. This is exactly the case. Junan County, Shandong Province, began to promote the two hybrid varieties "Fangza No. 2" and "Qiyu No. 26" in 1953. By 1956, 494 agricultural cooperatives had established 3,126 mu of seed production areas (areas for producing seeds), producing more than 460,000 jin of hybrid first-generation seeds. In 1957, more than 110,000 mu were promoted, accounting for about 53% of the county's corn planting area. The Fengcheng Experimental Station in Liaoning Province also began to test and promote four hybrid varieties in 1953, but because the technology was not handed over to the masses, the seed production work was only carried out by the experimental station and farms. By 1957, only more than 1,100 mu were promoted, accounting for only 5/1000 of the county's corn planting area. The two counties started promotion at the same time, but due to different viewpoints and methods, the promotion speed differed by a hundredfold. From the above facts, we can draw a conclusion: if we want to quickly promote hybrid corn seeds, do it more, better, faster, and more economically, we can only rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and hand over the technology to the masses.

Another idea that hinders the rapid promotion of hybrid corn seeds is "everything starts from a steady pace." In today's great leap forward, they still say that "other work can leap forward, but corn hybridization work cannot leap forward." The reason is that there are certain objective difficulties. Yes, any revolutionary work will encounter some difficulties, the question is what attitude you take towards these difficulties. Is it to overcome difficulties and conquer difficulties? Or bow to difficulties? These people's so-called "stability" is actually bowing to difficulties and is a complete conservative idea. In fact, according to the promotion experience of Shandong Province in recent years, there are no significant difficulties. The problem is that there is a fear of "messing things up" in the minds of these comrades. They require absolute step-by-step, no mess. Of course, things getting really messed up is not a good thing. The problem is whether a leap forward will cause chaos? In fact, it won't. In the past six years, only one million mu have been promoted. It cannot be said that it was unstable, and of course, there was no chaos; but the promotion that should have been done was not done in a timely manner, causing so much loss to production? What gain? What loss? Worth pondering.

Now the conditions for vigorously promoting hybrid corn seeds are fully mature. As long as we break down conservative ideas, formulate leap forward plans, and take revolutionary measures, it is entirely possible to promote hybrid varieties on 200 million mu and increase grain production by 10 billion jin in three years. Licheng County, Shandong Province, has put forward an advanced plan to popularize hybrid varieties in one year. Beijing also wants to achieve full popularization in three years, while promoting more productive double-cross hybrids. Hebei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Inner Mongolia and other provinces put forward a three-year popularization plan at the national corn hybridization training class. At present, many places are transferring parental lines for preparing hybrid seeds, introducing hybrid varieties from other places for trial planting, and running training classes, which shows that the promotion speed of hybrid varieties will be greatly accelerated. However, some farms prepare hybrid seeds, planning to plant them all on the farm, only hoping to get high yields on the farm, which is beneficial to the farm's operation, while ignoring the important significance of distributing hybrid seeds and conducting extensive demonstrations, which is very wrong.

Now spring planting has begun. In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, we should try every means to expand the planting area of hybrid corn seeds, and we can mobilize the masses to collect second-generation seeds for promotion in areas where there are no first-generation seeds yet. More importantly, we must seize the opportunity this year to do a good job in the experiment and demonstration of hybrid seeds, the breeding of parental seeds, and the teaching of technology, in order to make full preparations for the widespread and large-scale preparation of hybrid first-generation seeds next year.

    迅速普及杂交玉米种
    克让
    种植杂交玉米种增产显著，这已经在生产实践中得到充分证明。山东历城推广“坊杂2号”每亩增产在一百斤左右。莒南县推广了十多万亩，增产粮食六百多万斤。目前我国已有九十七个杂交种。在玉米的主要产区山东、山西、河南等省，都有了适合当地推广的杂交组合，这些品种一般每亩增产都在五十斤左右。根据这种情况，玉米杂交种应当是很快地得到推广的，但事实恰恰相反。1952年到1957年六年时间，全国只推广了一百万亩左右，仅占玉米种植面积二亿三千万亩的千分之四，进度非常迟缓。
    为甚么会这样迟缓呢？主要是部分技术人员和领导人有着严重的保守思想。有些技术人员不相信群众，认为群众掌握不了这样“复杂”的技术，只有依靠试验研究机构和专门的繁殖农场来配制杂交种，才能保证质量。其实不然。党早就告诉我们，只要真正依靠群众，发动了群众，事情就有办法。事实正是如此。山东莒南县1953年开始推广“坊杂2号”，“齐玉26号”两个杂交种，到1956年已有四百九十四个农业社建立了三千一百二十六亩的制种区（生产种子的地区），生产杂交第一代种子四十六万多斤。1957年就推广了十一万多亩，约占全县玉米种植面积的53％。辽宁省凤城试验站也在1953年开始试种推广四个杂交种，但是由于没有把技术交给群众，制种工作仅靠试验站和农场进行，到1957年才推广了一千一百多亩，仅占全县玉米种植面积的千分之五。两个县推广时间相同，但由于观点方法不同，推广速度相差百倍。从以上事实可以得出一个结论：要想把杂交玉米种迅速推广开来，办得更多、更好、更快、更省，只有依靠群众，发动群众，把技术交给群众。
    阻碍玉米杂交种迅速推广的另一种思想是“一切从稳步出发”。在今天大跃进声中，他们还是说“其他工作可以跃进，玉米杂交工作不能跃进”。理由是客观存在一定困难。是的，凡是一件革命工作都会碰到一些困难，问题是你采取甚么态度来对待这些困难。是战胜困难，克服困难？还是向困难低头？这些人之所谓“稳”，实际上正是向困难低头，是十足的保守思想。其实，根据山东省几年来的推广经验，并没有甚么了不起的困难。问题是在这些同志的头脑里存在着一种怕“搞乱”的思想，他们要求绝对地按部就班，一丝不乱。当然，真正乱了并不是好事。问题在于是否一跃进就会乱？事实上不会的。过去六年只推广了一百万亩，不可谓不稳了，当然也没有出甚么乱子；但是该推广的没有得到及时的推广，使生产遭受了多大的损失？何得？何失？值得深思。
    现在大力推广杂交玉米种的条件已经完全成熟。只要打破保守思想，订出跃进规划，采取革命措施，在三年内推广杂交种两亿亩，增产粮食百亿斤，也是完全可能的。山东历城县已提出一年普及杂交种的先进计划。北京市也要在三年达到全面普及，同时推广更为增产的双杂交种。河北、江苏、山东、内蒙古等省在全国玉米杂交训练班上提出了三年普及的规划。目前很多地方都调运配制杂交种的亲本，引进了外地的杂交种试种，开办了训练班，这些都显示了杂交种的推广速度将大大加快。但是有些农场配制的杂交种，计划全部种在场内，只希望场内得到高产，有利于农场的经营，而忽视了把杂交种分散出去，广泛进行示范的重要意义，是非常错误的。
    现在春播已经开始，为了争取今年的农业大丰收，应当想尽一切办法扩大玉米杂交种的种植面积，并且可以发动群众搜集第二代种子在还没有第一代种子的地区推广。更重要的是要抓住今年这个时机，做好杂交种的试验、示范、亲本种子的繁殖及技术传授等工作，为明年普遍大量的配制杂交第一代种子做好充分的准备。
