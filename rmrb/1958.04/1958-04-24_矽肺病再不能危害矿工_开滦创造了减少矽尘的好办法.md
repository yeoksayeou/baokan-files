Silicosis Can No Longer Harm Miners
Kailuan Creates Good Methods to Reduce Silica Dust

This dispatch from our newspaper's Tangshan bureau, dated April 23rd: In the great leap forward in production, the Kailuan Coal Mine adopted comprehensive dust reduction technical measures, eliminating the silicosis that seriously endangered workers' health. From April 11th to 21st, the Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Coal Miners' Union jointly held an on-site meeting at the Kailuan Coal Mine, deciding to universally promote this experience in coal mines across the country this year.

In the rock roadways of coal mines, after drilling and blasting, the flying rock dust contains a large amount of silica. When workers inhale this, they are prone to silicosis. In recent years, the Kailuan Coal Mine has taken many dust reduction measures and universally promoted wet operations using water injection on the side of pneumatic drills, reducing the rock dust content in each cubic meter of air from more than 1,000 milligrams to 4-6 milligrams. However, it still could not completely eliminate the harm of silica dust to workers' health. During the rectification campaign, the Kailuan Coal Mine criticized conservative thinking, liberated thinking, and boldly proposed to reduce silica dust to below the national standard of 2 milligrams per cubic meter this year. The mine leadership actively mobilized the masses to find technical solutions and, using the method of "experimental fields," decided to focus on experiments at the 1411 development working face of the Kailuan Tangshan Mine. Mine party and government leaders, engineers, doctors, and others worked alongside the workers, jointly analyzing the causes of high dust levels and researching solutions. As a result, in just over a month, on the basis of using water injection on the side of pneumatic drills for wet drilling, they created six dust reduction methods: washing rock walls with water after blasting, sprinkling water when loading drill rods, spraying water on the working face, cleaning ventilation, purifying water, and using water with wetting agents. After implementing these methods, testing showed that the dust content per cubic meter of air at this working face had been reduced from 4-6 milligrams to 1.79 milligrams, meeting the national standard. Due to the reduction of rock dust, the working environment was fundamentally improved, greatly stimulating the workers' enthusiasm. The average daily advance of the 1411 working face increased from about 1 meter before February to 4.8 meters.

Currently, about 20% of the development working faces in the Kailuan Coal Mine have implemented this comprehensive dust reduction measure. The entire mine has formulated this year's dust reduction great leap forward plan: all-rock roadways and semi-rock and semi-coal roadways will fully meet the national dust reduction standards by the end of August and the end of December, respectively.

    矽肺病再不能危害矿工
    开滦创造了减少矽尘的好办法
    本报唐山23日电　开滦煤矿在生产大跃进中，采用综合性降尘技术措施，消灭了严重危害工人健康的矽肺病。4月11日到21日，煤炭工业部和全国煤矿工会在开滦煤矿联合召开了现场会议，决定今年在全国各地煤矿普遍推行这一经验。
    在煤矿岩石巷道进行打眼放炮后，飞扬出来的岩石粉尘中，含有大量的二氧化矽，工人吸到肺里，就容易得矽肺病。几年来，开滦煤矿采取了许多降尘措施，并普遍地推行风钻侧面加水的湿式作业方法，使每立方公尺空气中的岩石粉尘含量由一千多毫克降到四至六毫克。但是，还不能彻底消灭矽尘对工人健康的损害。开滦煤矿在整风运动中，批判了保守思想，解放了思想，大胆地提出要在今年内把矽尘降到国家规定的每立方公尺二毫克以下的目标。矿的领导积极发动群众从技术上想办法，并且以搞“试验田”的方法，确定在开滦唐山矿一四一一开拓工作面上进行重点试验。矿上党、政领导干部、工程师和医师等跟工人一起劳动，共同分析粉尘多的原因和研究解决的办法。因而，在一个多月内，在使用风钻侧面加水进行湿打眼的基础上，又创造出放炮后用水洗刷岩壁、装钎洒水、工作面喷雾、清洁通风、净化用水和用水加湿润剂等六项降尘的办法。实行这些办法后，经过测定，这个工作面的每立方公尺空气含尘量已由过去的四至六毫克降到一点七九毫克，达到了国家规定的标准。由于岩石粉尘的降低，从根本上改善了劳动环境，大大地激发了工人的干劲。一四一一工作面的掘进平均日进尺由2月份以前的一公尺左右提高到四点八公尺。
    目前，开滦煤矿已有20％左右的开拓工作面推行了这种综合性降尘措施。全矿已经制定出了今年的降尘跃进计划：全岩巷道和半岩半煤巷道分别在8月底和12月底全部达到国家规定的降尘标准。（唐荧）
