Heilongjiang Basically Eliminates Illiteracy

(Our newspaper, Harbin, 29th dispatch) On the eve of "May Day," Heilongjiang Province, where the illiteracy rate was originally over 85%, has completed the task of basically eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people nine years ahead of schedule. This has enabled 86.92% of the province's young and middle-aged workers to recognize more than 2,000 characters, and 81% of young and middle-aged farmers to recognize more than 1,500 characters. Citizens and members of handicraft cooperatives have also exceeded the national literacy standards. Thus, the days of the cultural great leap forward, which the people of the province have been longing for for thousands of years, have arrived, and the laboring people have uprooted the "white" roots of cultural backwardness. This has laid a preliminary foundation for further universal learning of culture, science and technology by all the people. After eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, Heilongjiang Province has launched a "Read a Hundred Books, Write Ten Thousand Characters" campaign of extensive reading and practice in order to consolidate and improve the results of literacy. At the same time, it is advancing victoriously, leaping forward towards eliminating the remaining portion of illiteracy and universally establishing spare-time primary and secondary schools and cadre red and expert schools.

    文化大翻身的日子已经到来
    黑龙江基本扫除了文盲
    本报哈尔滨29日电　“五一”前夕，原来文盲达85％以上的黑龙江省，提前九年基本完成了扫除全省青壮年文盲的任务，使全省86.92％的青壮年职工都认识了二千多字；81％的青壮年农民认识了一千五百多字。市民和手工业合作社的社员也都超过了国家规定的识字指标。至此，全省人民盼望千百年的文化大翻身的日子已经到来，劳动人民拔掉了文化落后的“白”根。为进一步全民学习文化科学技术打下了初步基础。黑龙江省在扫除了青壮年文盲后，为了巩固和提高扫盲的成果，已开展了“读百本书、写万个字”的多读多练活动。同时正在乘胜前进，朝着扫除剩余的一部分文盲，和普遍建立业余中小学和干部红专学校跃进。
