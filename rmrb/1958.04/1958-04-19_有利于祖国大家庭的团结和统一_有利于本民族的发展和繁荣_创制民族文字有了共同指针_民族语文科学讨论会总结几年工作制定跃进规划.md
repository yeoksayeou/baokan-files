Xinhua News Agency, April 18th—The Second National Minority Language Scientific Discussion Meeting, jointly convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, concluded on the 16th after lasting twenty days. The meeting determined the principles for assisting minority nationalities in creating writing systems in the future and formulated a leap forward plan for national language and writing work.
    The discussion meeting was attended by language workers from various ethnic groups, ethnic publishing workers, responsible persons from some ethnic autonomous regions, and representatives from relevant units such as the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, totaling 126 people.
    The discussion meeting summarized the work of the past few years, and after full debate and research, determined the general principles for assisting minority nationalities in creating writing systems in the future. The discussion meeting believes that: language and writing are tools for exchanging ideas. They not only directly affect the progress and development of their own ethnic groups, but also have a great relationship to the unity of the motherland and the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. Therefore, when creating, reforming, or selecting writing systems, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of being conducive to the development and prosperity of the nation, that is, being conducive to the unity and unification of the socialist motherland's big family and the common development and prosperity of all ethnic groups. Because the situations of various ethnic groups in our country are different, the methods of solving the problem of writing cannot be completely the same. According to the actual situation of minority nationalities in our country and the work experience of the past few years: 1. For ethnic groups with a relatively concentrated population, a relatively consistent language, and a demand from the masses to create a writing system, create a writing system. 2. For ethnic groups with basically the same language, the method of a "writing alliance" can be adopted to use a single writing system together. 3. The problem of writing for some ethnic groups with large language differences should be handled with caution. Generally speaking, it is not conducive to internal ethnic group contact, nor is it conducive to ethnic group development, for one ethnic group to create two or more writing systems. This method should only be considered in special and unavoidable circumstances. According to the specific situation of minority nationalities in our country, if it is impossible for the same ethnic group to use one writing system, some can adopt the writing systems of other ethnic groups, some can establish writing alliances with ethnic groups with similar languages, and some can create writing systems independently. As for the multiple writing systems within the same ethnic group that have been left over from history, conditions should be created to gradually unify them. 4. Some ethnic groups have long used Chinese and Chinese characters or the languages and writing systems of other ethnic groups. These languages and writing systems have in fact become the languages and writing systems of this ethnic group itself, and no additional writing system will be created. 5. For certain ethnic groups who have partially used or are already familiar with another ethnic group's language, if the people of their own ethnic group believe that it is not necessary to create a separate writing system, they should choose the writing system that is suitable for them.
    The discussion meeting also conducted repeated research on issues such as the letter form of minority languages, the formulation of new terminology, minority nationalities learning Chinese and Chinese characters, Han cadres learning local ethnic languages, and the promotion of minority languages.
    In order to adapt to the leaping development of various construction undertakings in minority areas and to welcome the arrival of a cultural upsurge, this discussion meeting decided that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, every ethnic group that needs to create a writing system should have a suitable writing system. Prior to this, minority language research institutions had helped twelve ethnic groups design eighteen writing system programs, conducted a general survey of the languages of thirty-three minority nationalities, compiled and published a large number of books for eliminating illiteracy and popularizing education in ethnic areas, and trained more than 30,000 ethnic language work cadres. Relevant ethnic areas have established scientific research and work institutions for minority languages and have generally convened regional scientific discussion meetings on minority languages. Everyone believes that the achievements made in ethnic language work over the past few years have provided favorable conditions for future work; in particular, the "Several Principles on Designing Letters in Minority Language Programs" approved by the State Council has provided a common guideline for all aspects of minority language work in the future.
    This discussion meeting was conducted in the spirit of rectification. Before the official opening of the discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 14th, a seventeen-day preparatory meeting was held. During the preparatory meeting, everyone used methods of great airing of views, big-character posters, and big debates to sharply expose and criticize the problems existing in ethnic language work, especially the bourgeois ideology manifested in ethnic language work. Everyone repeatedly criticized the bad tendencies of being divorced from politics, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses in ethnic language work, and pointed out that language workers must be both red and expert in order to complete the tasks assigned to them by the people.
    Pan Zinian, deputy director of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke at the meeting, and Bao Erhan, director of the Institute of Minority Languages, made a report on "The Achievements of Minority Language Work in the Past Two Years and Opinions on Future Work." In his report on his visit to the Soviet Union, Deputy Director Fu Maoji introduced to everyone the development of ethnic languages in the Soviet Union and the advanced experience in solving the problem of ethnic writing. Liu Chun, vice chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, made speeches both before and after the official opening of the discussion meeting. In their speeches and reports, they all pointed out that the achievements of ethnic language work in the past few years are the main thing, but the problem of the struggle between the proletarian ideology and the bourgeois ideology in the work must be solved. The tendency of language research to be divorced from reality is manifested in overemphasizing differences and disagreements in work, and ignoring the commonalities between each other. In the development of ethnic languages and new terminology, there is an emphasis on the purification of ethnic languages, excluding loanwords from Chinese and other ethnic languages, and overemphasizing digging, excavating, and creating, which leads to being divorced from the masses and affects inter-ethnic communication and cultural exchange. They pointed out that language science is a social science, and it cannot serve socialist construction if it is divorced from the socialist road, and it will become useless. They asked everyone to care about politics and train themselves to become language workers who are both red and expert.

### 有利于祖国大家庭的团结和统一  有利于本民族的发展和繁荣  创制民族文字有了共同指针  民族语文科学讨论会总结几年工作制定跃进规划

    有利于祖国大家庭的团结和统一  有利于本民族的发展和繁荣
    创制民族文字有了共同指针
    民族语文科学讨论会总结几年工作制定跃进规划
    新华社18日讯　由中国科学院、中华人民共和国民族事务委员会联合召开的第二次少数民族语文科学讨论会，历时二十天，在16日闭幕。会议确定了今后帮助少数民族创制文字的原则，并制定出民族语文工作的跃进规划。
    参加讨论会的有各民族语文工作者、民族出版工作者、部分民族自治地方的党政负责人，以及中共中央宣传部、中华人民共和国教育部等有关单位的代表，共一百二十六人。
    讨论会总结了几年来的工作，在经过充分争辩和研究后，确定了今后帮助少数民族创制文字的一般原则。讨论会认为：语言文字是交流思想的工具，它不仅直接影响着自己民族的进步和发展，并且对于祖国的统一和各民族的共同繁荣也有很大的关系，所以在创制、改革或选择文字时，必须坚持有利于本民族的发展和繁荣，也就是有利于社会主义祖国大家庭的团结、统一和各民族共同发展和繁荣的原则。因为我国各民族的情况不同，所以解决文字问题的办法也不能完全一样。根据我国少数民族的实际情况和几年来的工作经验：一、对于人口比较聚居，语言也比较一致，群众又要求创制文字的民族，创制一种文字。二、对于语言基本相同的民族，可以采用“文字联盟”的办法，合用一种文字。三、对于某些语言分歧很大的民族，在解决他们的文字问题时应当慎重。一般说来，一个民族创制两种以上的文字不利于民族内部的联系，也不利于民族的发展。这种办法只有在特殊的、不得已的情况下加以考虑。根据我国少数民族的具体情况，如果同一民族不可能使用一种文字时，有的可以采用其他民族的文字，有的可以同语言相近的民族建立文字联盟，有的也可以单独创制文字。至于历史上遗留下来的同一民族中的多种文字，应该创造条件来逐渐统一。四、有些民族长期以来已经使用了汉语汉文或其他民族的语言文字，这种语言文字事实上已成为这个民族自己的语言文字，不再另外创制文字。五、某些已经部分使用或者已经熟悉了一种其他民族语言的民族，如果本族人民认为可以不单独创制文字，应当由他们选择自己适用的文字。
    对于少数民族文字的字母形式、制订新词术语、少数民族学习汉语汉文和汉族干部学习当地民族语文、少数民族文字的推行等问题，这次讨论会也作了反复研究。
    为了适应少数民族地区各项建设事业的飞跃发展和迎接文化高潮的到来，这次讨论会决定：在第二个五年计划期间，要做到每个需要创制文字的民族，都有一种适用的文字。在此以前，少数民族语言研究机构已帮助十二个民族设计了十八种文字方案，普遍调查了三十三个少数民族的语言，编译和出版了大批民族地区扫除文盲和普及教育的书籍，培养了三万多民族语文工作干部。各有关民族地区都已建立了少数民族语文的科学研究和工作机构，并且普遍召开了地区性的少数民族语文科学讨论会。大家认为：民族语文工作几年来所获得的这些成就，为今后进行工作提供了有利条件；特别是国务院批准的“关于少数民族文字方案中设计字母的几项原则”，使今后少数民族语文工作各个方面都有了共同的指针。
    这次讨论会是采取整风的精神进行的。在14日下午讨论会正式开幕前，曾经进行了十七天的预备会。大家在预备会期间通过大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的方式，对民族语文工作中存在的问题，特别是民族语文工作中表现的资产阶级思想，进行了尖锐的揭露和批判。大家反复批判了民族语文工作中存在的脱离政治、脱离实际和脱离群众的不良倾向，指出语文工作者必须又红又专，才能完成人民交付给他们的任务。
    中国科学院哲学社会科学部副主任潘梓年在会上讲了话，少数民族语言研究所所长包尔汉作了“两年来少数民族语文工作的成就和今后工作的意见”的报告，副所长傅懋绩在他的访问苏联的报告中，向大家介绍了苏联民族语文发展的情况和解决民族文字问题的先进经验。民族事务委员会副主任刘春，在讨论会正式开幕前后都作了讲话。他们在讲话和报告中都指出：民族语文工作几年来的成就是主要的，但是工作中无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想两条道路斗争的问题必须解决。语言研究脱离实际的倾向，表现在工作上是过分强调差别和分歧，忽视相互间的共同性；在民族语言的发展和新词术语中，强调民族语言的纯化，排斥汉语和其他民族语言的借词，过分强调挖、掘、创，形成脱离群众，影响了民族间的相互交际和文化交流。他们指出：语文科学是社会科学，脱离了社会主义的道路就不可能为社会主义建设服务，就成了无用的东西。他们要求大家关心政治，把自己锻炼成为又红又专的语文工作者。
