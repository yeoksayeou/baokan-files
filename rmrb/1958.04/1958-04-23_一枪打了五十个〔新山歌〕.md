At Shagou Granary near Zhu Jia Tuo
Sparrows are still numerous around.
On the tenth afternoon, as dusk fell,
Sparrows prepared to return home and rest.
Some were hungry and couldn't walk,
Some were thirsty and urgently cried.
They all fell to the ground together,
Searching for food in groups.
Unexpectedly, fire came from the side,
The whole family couldn't escape.
The person who fired the gun was Chen Fangshu,
Fiftieth Shot with One Bullet
(Sichuan Yibin)
