Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 4th: Guangdong Province has begun harvesting 14 million mu of spring-harvested grain crops. According to estimates from relevant departments, based on the current growth and harvesting of these crops, approximately 2.5 billion jin can be harvested this year, an increase of 1.5 billion jin compared to last year (converted to grain equivalent for miscellaneous grains), and 700 million jin more than the best harvest in 1956.

This year, the most abundant spring-harvested crop in Guangdong Province is sweet potatoes, followed by rapeseed, beans, and wheat.

Recently, Party committees at all levels have been actively taking measures to strive for greater increases in the yield of spring-harvested crops. Although the harvesting of sweet potatoes has already begun, the majority of sweet potatoes are still in the ripening stage. If they grow in the ground for a few more days and are harvested later, the yield could increase significantly. However, delaying the harvest conflicts with the transplanting of early rice. To solve this problem, Party committees at all levels are preparing to adopt two methods: raising seedlings separately and converting some fields into late-season seedling beds.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 4th: Hunan's more than 30 million mu of spring-harvested crops are growing well, and a bumper harvest is expected. Among them, 11 million mu of grain crops such as wheat, beans, and potatoes have generally been top-dressed once or twice, and it is estimated that 1.2 billion to 1.5 billion jin of grain can be harvested. More than 4.5 million mu of rapeseed have also generally branched and formed pods. Farmers in Cili County are strengthening field management, seizing the time to cultivate and top-dress lagging fields, and striving to harvest an average of 100 jin of rapeseed per mu throughout the county.

Cadres in various localities have established some spring-harvested crop experimental fields, which have played a significant demonstration and promotion role in cultivation and management. The more than 760 mu of high-yield spring-harvested crop experimental fields established by more than 500 cadres in Anxiang County, through demonstration, have changed the masses' habit of not applying fertilizer. As a result, all crops are growing better than in previous years.

### 广东开始收割甘薯油菜  湖南春收作物可望丰收

    广东开始收割甘薯油菜
    湖南春收作物可望丰收
    据新华社广州4日电　广东省一千四百万亩春收粮食作物已经开始收割。据有关部门估计，按照这些作物目前生长和收割情况来看，今年大约可以收获二十五亿斤，比去年增产十五亿斤（杂粮折谷），比收成最好的1956年还多七亿斤。
    今年广东省春收作物最多的是甘薯，其它是油菜、豆类和小麦。
    近日来，各级党委正积极采取措施，争取春收作物更多增产。虽然现在已开始收割甘薯，但是大部分甘薯还正在成熟期，如果在地里多生长几天，晚收一些时候，就可能增产很多。但迟收同早稻插秧有矛盾。这个问题，各级党委准备采取寄秧和改作晚造秧田两个办法来加以解决。
    据新华社长沙4日电　湖南三千多万亩春收作物生长良好，丰收在望。其中一千一百万亩小麦、豆类和马铃薯等粮食作物已普遍追肥一两次，预计可收粮食十二亿到十五亿斤。四百五十多万亩油菜也普遍分枝结实。慈利县农民正在加强田间管理，抓紧落后田的中耕追肥，争取全县油菜籽平均每亩收到一百斤。
    各地干部都搞了一些春收作物试验田，对培育管理起了很大示范推动作用。安乡县五百多干部建立的七百六十多亩春收作物丰产试验田，经过示范，改变了群众不施肥的习惯。因此，各种作物都比往年长得好。
