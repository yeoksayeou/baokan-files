    I Shook Hands with Chairman Mao
    I want to tell you something that made me very excited. That is, Chairman Mao came to Longchang County, Sichuan Province, and I, an ordinary railway worker, also shook hands with him.
    On March 27th, I heard that Chairman Mao had come to Longchang. After getting off the train, he also talked with two old farmers who were working nearby and took a picture with them. I felt very sad that I didn't see him; but I guessed that he would come to Longchang to take the train back to Chengdu, so I felt happy again. After finishing work that afternoon, I didn't even bother to eat dinner, and ran to the front of the waiting room with everyone to wait for him. Chairman Mao really came back from the County Committee. At this time, it was raining, but no one paid attention. They just shouted in unison: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party! Long live! Long long live! The cheers were accompanied by lasting applause. I had the opportunity to stand next to Chairman Mao and shake his hand tightly. Chairman Mao, standing in front of me, was so strong, wearing an ordinary khaki uniform, and a pair of leather shoes with very worn rubber soles.
    The simple image of the great people's leader remains in my mind and cannot be erased for a long time.

### 我和毛主席握了手

    我和毛主席握了手
    我想告诉你们一件使我非常激动的事。那就是，毛主席来到了我们四川省隆昌县，我，一个普通的铁路工人，也和他老人家握了手。
    3月27日那天，听说毛主席来到了隆昌，下车后，还和附近正在劳动的两个老农民谈了话，一起照了像。没有看到他老人家，心里很难受；但猜想到他回成都时还会到隆昌乘车时，心里又愉快起来。那天下午干完活，我晚饭也没顾得吃，就和大家一道跑到候车室门前去等了。毛主席果然从县委会回来了。这时，天在下雨，但是，谁也没有注意，只是齐声高喊：毛主席万岁！共产党万岁！万岁！万万岁！欢呼声伴着经久不息的掌声。我有机会站到了毛主席的身旁，紧紧地握住毛主席的手。站在我面前的毛主席，身体那么结实，穿着一身普通的黄卡叽衣服，一双皮鞋，胶底都磨耗了很多。
    伟大的人民领袖的朴实形象长久留在我脑中不能消失。
