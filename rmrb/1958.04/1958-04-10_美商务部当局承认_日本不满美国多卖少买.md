Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th -- US Department of Commerce authorities admit that the US trade policy of selling more to and buying less from Japan has caused widespread dissatisfaction in Japan.

    Assistant Secretary of Commerce Kearns announced the contents of Williams' telegram at a press conference on the 8th, saying: "Japanese leaders have pointed out in every meeting and conference that the United States is Japan's number one market, but Japan buys far more goods from the United States than the United States buys from Japan."

    It is reported that Japan bought goods worth approximately $1.3 billion from the United States last year, while only selling approximately $600 million worth of goods in the US market. Japan's trade deficit with the United States reached approximately $700 million.

    美商务部当局承认
    日本不满美国多卖少买
    据新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：美国商务部当局承认美国对日本的多卖少买的贸易政策在日本引起普遍不满。
    美国商务部助理部长基恩斯8日在一个记者招待会上公布威廉斯的电报内容说：“日本领袖在每一次会晤和会议中都指出，美国是日本的第一号市场，但是日本从美国购买的商品数量比美国从日本购买的多得很多。”
    据报道，日本去年从美国购买了价值约十三亿美元的商品，而只在美国市场出售了约六亿美元的商品，日本对美贸易逆差达七亿元左右。
