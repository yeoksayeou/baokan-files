Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: In the first quarter of this year, China's industry, transportation, and capital construction all overfulfilled the state plan. Market sales were balanced, and prices were stable. All aspects are advancing at an unprecedented rate, and the development trend is very encouraging.

The following are some of the main figures and situations extracted from the National Bureau of Statistics' report on the implementation of the national economic plan for the first quarter:

    I. Industrial production in the first quarter was much larger than in the same period in previous years.

    The total output value of industrial enterprises with independent accounting across the country in the first quarter completed 105.3% of the state plan, and the estimated total industrial output value (including enterprises without independent accounting, excluding handicrafts) completed more than 25% of the annual plan. In previous years, the proportion of the total output value in the first quarter to the actual completion of the whole year was generally around 23%. The proportion of the first quarter of this year to the annual plan is much larger than the first quarter of any previous year.

    All central industrial ministries completed the first quarter's state plan. The total output value of central enterprises completed 106.4% of the quarterly plan, an increase of 26.6% compared with the same period last year. The fastest growth was in the First Ministry of Machine Building (63.8%), followed by the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Coal Industry (all increased by more than 30%). Local enterprises completed 104.3% of the quarterly plan, an increase of 19.1% compared with the same period last year. The fastest growth was in Yunnan Province (72%), Fujian Province (53.8%), Anhui Province (53.5%), and Hebei Province (40.3%), followed by Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Gansu Province (all increased by more than 30%). Shanghai and Liaoning, which have large output values, increased by 10.7% and 11.9% respectively. In previous years, except for 1954 and 1956, the production level in the first quarter generally declined to varying degrees compared with the fourth quarter of the previous year, while the first quarter of this year increased by 3.5% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and the increase was higher than that of the first quarter of 1954 and 1956.

    Production is growing month by month
    New products increase unprecedentedly

    Among the thirty-two major products nationwide, twenty-nine, including electricity, raw coal, crude oil, steel, copper, nitrogen fertilizer, cement, metal cutting machine tools, timber transported, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and machine-made paper, exceeded the first quarter's state plan. Compared with the same period last year, thirteen, including raw coal, crude oil, nitrogen fertilizer, metal cutting machine tools, and timber transported, increased by more than 30%, and fourteen, including electricity, steel, cement, cotton yarn, and machine-made paper, increased by 10% to 30%.

    The trend of monthly production growth is very obvious. Especially in March, the huge economic effect produced by the gradual deepening of the double-anti movement has begun to show. Taking the average daily output value in January as 100, it increased to 102 in February, and then rapidly increased to 108 in March. Compared with the same period last year, the cumulative total output value in January and February increased by 16% compared with the same period last year, while the increase in March reached 29%.

    The scale of new product trial production expanded unprecedentedly in the first quarter of this year. Beijing trial-produced 500 new products and new designs in the first quarter, equivalent to more than half of the total number of new products and new designs made in the city last year. Nanjing made 140 types in the first quarter, accounting for 63% of the whole year last year. Tianjin made about 170 types, and Wuxi had 84 types. Important products successfully trial-produced nationwide in the first quarter include electroslag welding machines, 450-horsepower diesel engines, 220,000-volt high-voltage current mutual inductors, four-axis automatic lathes, high-precision gear grinding machines, vertical drilling machines with a drilling diameter of 75 centimeters, Gongnong brand universal automobiles, automatic dump trucks, universal tractors, tree planting machines, rice transplanters, television transmitters, television receivers, rayon, wild fiber fabrics, and 210-count spun silk.

    In the first quarter, the technical and economic indicators of production in various industrial departments continued to show new records, which were constantly broken and refreshed. The new record of blast furnace utilization coefficient was continuously refreshed seven times in the second half of March (on April 5, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant refreshed the first quarter record again with 0.557 tons/cubic meter). The ammonium nitrogen recovery rate of Dalian Chemical Company increased to 98.38%, the finished product rate of paper at Jilin Paper Mill increased to 96.2%, the amount of pulp used per unit of paper at Shixian Paper Mill was 0.994 kg, and the average first-grade and first-class product rate of cotton yarn in the textile industry in January and February increased to 96.15%, and the first-grade product rate of cotton cloth increased to 97.2%.

    II. Capital Construction Investment increased by 51% compared with the same period last year.

    In the first quarter, the total investment in capital construction nationwide accumulated to 14% of the planned total annual investment, and the actual amount of work completed could reach about 15% of the annual plan, which is higher than the level in the same period in previous years. From the perspective of completed absolute value, the investment amount increased by 51% compared with the same period last year, among which, the construction and installation engineering increased by about 60%. The investment amount completed in March exceeded the sum of January and February.

    The completion level of the annual plan by various central ministries is lower than that of local governments. The central level is 13.7%, and the local level is 17.3%. The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power has the highest completion rate of the annual plan (22.5%), and the industrial ministries of coal, metallurgy, and the First Ministry of Machine Building completed the plan between 14% and 15%. Guangdong Province has the highest completion rate of the annual plan at the local level, reaching 48.5%, followed by Hubei and Guangxi provinces, reaching 34% and 31.7% respectively.

    Among the 156 key units, 109 were under construction and continued construction in 1958. The investment amount in the first quarter completed 16.4% of the annual plan, among which the construction and installation engineering completed 18.7% of the annual plan, which is higher than the completion rate in the same period last year.

    According to incomplete statistics, the total value of newly added fixed assets in the first quarter increased by about 35% compared with the same period last year. The newly added main product production capacity includes 24,000 kilowatts of electricity, 197,000 tons/year of coal, 8,907 tons/year of natural petroleum, 5,000 tons/year of synthetic petroleum, 172,000 tons/year of pig iron, 40,000 tons/year of sulfuric acid, 200,000 tons/year of superphosphate, 20,000 spindles of cotton yarn, 584 weaving machines, 6,560 tons/year of paper, 5,600 tons/year of sugar, 151.7 kilometers of railway track laying mileage, and 1,913 kilometers of newly built highways.
