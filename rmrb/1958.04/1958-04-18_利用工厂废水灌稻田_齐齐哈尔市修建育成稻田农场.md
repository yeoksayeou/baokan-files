    Using Factory Wastewater to Irrigate Rice Paddies
    Qiqihar City Builds育城稻田农场 (Yucheng Rice Paddy Farm)
    (Our Newspaper reports) Qiqihar City recently started construction on a 育城稻田农场 (Yucheng Rice Paddy Farm) near the heavy industrial factories in Fularji. This farm will use wastewater from the Fularji Thermal Power Plant and Heavy Machinery Plant, as well as urban sewage and rainwater, for irrigation. Once completed, it can develop 12,000 hectares of rice paddies, producing 96 million jin of rice annually.
    This farm is a result of socialist industrialization, requiring little investment, yielding great results, and allowing for quick construction. To build a farm of this size, over 12,000 hectares, only requires constructing an 8-hua li long water conveyance trunk line to introduce wastewater from the thermal power plant into the rice paddies. The entire project only involves 400,000 cubic meters of earthwork, which can be completed by 1,000 people in three months. The average investment per hectare is less than 6 yuan. According to reliable calculations, without such favorable conditions, building such a rice paddy farm by drawing water from rivers would require an investment of at least 4 to 5 million yuan and take three years to complete.
    The construction of this rice paddy farm was initiated by the local masses. When cadres and the masses of Du'ermenqin Township were investigating water sources during large-scale water conservancy efforts, they found it a pity that the wastewater from the thermal power plant was flowing into the river. They suggested using this water to develop rice paddies. Their suggestion immediately received attention from the leadership. After investigation and research, the decision was made to build this farm.

    利用工厂废水灌稻田
    齐齐哈尔市修建育成稻田农场
    本报讯　齐齐哈尔市最近在富拉尔基重工业工厂附近动工修建一座育成稻田农场。这座农场将利用富拉尔基热电厂、重型机器厂的废水、城市的污水和雨水三股水灌溉，建成以后可以发展一万二千公顷稻田，每年可产九千六百万斤水稻。
    这座农场是社会主义工业化带来的一座投资少、收效大而且建场时间快的农场。这样一座面积达一万二千多公顷的农场，只要修筑一条八华里长的输水干线把热电厂的废水引进稻田即可，整个工程只有四十万立方公尺土方量，只要一千人干三个月就可完工，平均每公顷投资不到六元。据可靠的计算，如果没有这样的优越条件，从江河引水修建这样一座稻田农场，至少要投资四百万到五百万元，需要三年的工夫才能建成。
    这座稻田农场，是由当地群众倡议修建的。杜尔门沁乡的群众和干部在大兴水利中查水源时，发现热电厂的废水流进江里很可惜，建议用这些水来发展稻田，他们的建议立刻得到领导的重视，经过调查研究，就确定了修建这座农场。
