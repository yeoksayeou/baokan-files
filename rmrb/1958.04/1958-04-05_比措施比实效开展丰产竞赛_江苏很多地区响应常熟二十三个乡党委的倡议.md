    Compare Measures, Compare Effectiveness, Launch Bumper Harvest Competition
    Many Regions in Jiangsu Respond to the Proposal of the Twenty-Three Township Party Committees of Changshu
    (Our Newspaper News) The Party Committees of Nanfeng and 22 other townships in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, in order to achieve "wheat catching up with rice, rice doubling" in 1958, proposed to all township Party committees in the province in March to launch a socialist agricultural high-yield competition, and put forward a resounding slogan: "Ten points of targets, twelve points of measures, twenty-four points of effort."
    The main points of this proposal are:
    After the Jiangsu Provincial Party Congress, through the great debate of great blooming and great contending on the great leap forward in agricultural production, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and people has been greatly improved, their confidence has been multiplied, and their enthusiasm has soared to the sky. They are determined to leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again. The broad masses of the people have infinite confidence in their own strength. Under the present conditions, as long as we give full play to the labor enthusiasm of the masses, things are "not afraid of not being able to do it, but afraid of not being able to think of it; as long as we can think of it, we can definitely do it."
    Based on the current favorable situation, we are determined to work hard for a year to change the production outlook of each township. The goal is: "Wheat catching up with rice, rice doubling!" And use this slogan to launch a socialist competition with fraternal townships in the province. The specific indicators are: "1,000 catties of rice, 500 catties of wheat, and 200 catties of ginned cotton," to achieve 1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu, one pig per person, 100 cubic feet of earth per laborer, and 100 trees per person. These twenty-three townships also put forward five specific measures: completely eliminate drought and flood disasters, vigorously accumulate natural fertilizer, prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, continue to do a good job in "three guarantees and one wing," comprehensively implement "four fixings to the fields," "know a year in advance," and promote advanced technology.
    In order to ensure the realization of the great leap forward indicators and increased production measures, the Nanfeng and other twenty-three township Party committees decided to: change the leadership style, improve working methods; organize visits, appraisals and competitions; all township and commune cadres should engage in experimental fields and learn production technology.
    While publishing the above proposal, Xinhua Daily published an editorial entitled "Respond to the Twenty-Three Townships of Changshu County!" The editorial said: The proposal of the Party Committees of Nanfeng and 22 other townships in Changshu County to put forward such indicators, measures, and slogans, and to launch a competition with fraternal townships throughout the province, is conditional, based, and has a mass base. Through this proposal, all localities will surely "use ten points of targets, twelve points of measures, and twenty-four points of effort" to push the current production movement to a new peak.
    Recently, many areas in Jiangsu have been taking various measures to exceed targets and realize leap forward plans based on their specific local conditions. Huaiyin Prefecture, which has always grown dry grains, has basically completed the preparations for a large-scale "dry land to paddy field" conversion this year. At present, the entire prefecture has determined that the area of "dry land to paddy field" conversion is 1.65 million mu; the yield per mu should jump to 445 catties, an increase of 100% over last year; various measures to increase production have been determined and specifically arranged to the people and fields, and are personally controlled by the masses. Counties such as Nantong have taken measures to increase production in response to the reasons for backwardness in production, and have continued to carry out preparatory farming activities centered on lowering the groundwater level and preparing fertilizer, determined to catch up with the new cotton areas.

    比措施比实效开展丰产竞赛
    江苏很多地区响应常熟二十三个乡党委的倡议
    本报讯　江苏省常熟县南丰等二十三个乡党委，为了在1958年实现“三麦赶水稻，水稻翻一番”，3月间向全省各个乡党委提出了开展社会主义农业高额丰产竞赛的倡议，并且提出了一个响亮的口号：十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲。
    这个倡议书的要点是：
    在江苏省党代表大会以后，经过对农业生产大跃进的大鸣大放大辩论，广大干部群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高，信心百倍，干劲冲天，决心跃进、跃进、再跃进。广大群众对自己的力量抱着无限的信心。在现在的条件下，只要充分发挥群众的劳动热情，事情是“不怕做不到，只怕想不到，只要能想到，一定能做到。”
    根据当前的有利形势，决心苦干一年，改变各乡的生产面貌。目标是：“三麦赶水稻，水稻翻一番！”并以这个口号向全省各兄弟乡开展社会主义竞赛。具体指标是：“稻一千、麦五百、皮棉收二百”，做到每亩千担肥，每人一头猪，每个劳动力百方土，每人百棵树。这二十三个乡还提出了五项具体措施：彻底消灭旱涝灾害，大力积集自然肥料，防治病虫害，继续搞好“三包一翼”、全面推行“四定到田”、“一年早知道”，推广先进技术。
    为了保证实现大跃进的指标和增产措施，南丰等二十三个乡党委决定要做到：转变领导作风，改进工作方法；组织参观、评比竞赛；全体乡社干部都搞试验田，学习生产技术。
    新华日报在登出上述倡议的同时，发表了“向常熟县的二十三个乡应战！”的社论。社论说：常熟县南丰等二十三个乡党委提出这样的指标、措施和口号，同全省各兄弟乡开展竞赛，是有条件、有根据、有群众基础的。经过这个倡议，各地一定都会“以十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”，把当前的生产运动推向一个新的高峰。
    最近，江苏许多地区，都在针对当地具体情况，采取各种措施，超过指标，实现跃进计划。一向种植旱谷作物的淮阴专区，今年大面积“旱改水”的准备工作已经基本上就绪。目前，全专区已确定“旱改水”面积为一百六十五万亩；单产要跳到四百四十五斤，比去年增产一倍；确定了各项增产措施，并具体安排到人到田头，由群众亲自掌握。南通等县针对生产中的落后原因采取增产措施，持续开展以降低地下水位、准备肥料为中心的备耕活动，决心赶上新棉区。
