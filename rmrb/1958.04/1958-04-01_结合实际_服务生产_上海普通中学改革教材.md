    Integrate with Practice, Serve Production
    Shanghai's Ordinary Middle Schools Reform Teaching Materials
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th -- Two hundred and seven ordinary middle schools in Shanghai held a teaching material innovation promotion conference on March 29th.
    After the general launch of work-study programs in schools, the content of teaching materials was significantly revealed to be detached from the practicalities of industrial and agricultural production. Literature, history, and other courses emphasized the ancient over the modern, or contained more foreign materials than domestic ones, and were disconnected from politics. Schools first debated these issues, reached conclusions, and then proceeded with reforms. Some schools are now preparing to merge literature and Chinese language courses, teaching grammar and rhetoric in conjunction with literature. Much of the arithmetic taught in the first year of junior high school has already been taught in elementary school, and this repetitive material will be streamlined. In the past, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology textbooks lacked knowledge of production skills. Teachers have now decided to use the spring break to go to factories and the countryside to collect materials and supplement the applied skills content. History and geography textbooks will also be greatly streamlined, with supplementary local historical materials, climate, and geographical environment materials added.
    Chen Linhu, Deputy Director of the Education and Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, said at the meeting that teaching serves production, and with the great leap forward in production, textbooks cannot remain unchanged for long. Textbook reform reflects the development of social production, and teachers in all schools should "participate, every school should take action," teaching, debating, and revising simultaneously. Except for the teaching materials for the third year of junior high school and the third year of senior high school, which should cater to the entrance examinations, the teaching materials for other classes can be compiled by the schools themselves, and efforts should be made to finalize a set of new teaching materials for various courses through evaluation during this summer vacation.

    结合实际　服务生产
    上海普通中学改革教材
    据新华社上海30日电　上海二百零七所普通中学于3月29日举行了教材革新促进大会。
    一般学校展开勤工俭学活动以后，显著地暴露出教材内容脱离工农业生产实际。文学、历史等课程厚古薄今，或者外国材料多、本国材料少，与政治脱节。各校首先对这些问题进行辩论，得到结论后即行改革。现在有一些学校准备把文学和汉语课合并，结合文学课讲授语法和修辞。初中一年级的算术大部分在小学已经教过，这部分重复的教材都将精简。过去数、理、化和生物学等教材中缺少生产技能方面的知识，现在教师们决定利用春假期间下厂、下乡收集资料，把应用的技能教材补充进去。历史、地理等教材也要大大精简，另行补充乡土的史料、气候、地理环境等材料。
    中共上海市委员会教育卫生部副部长、上海市教育局长陈琳瑚在会上说，教学是为生产服务的，生产在大跃进，教科书不能长期不改，教材改革正是社会生产发展的反映，各校教师应该“人人参加、校校动手”，一边教学、一边辩论、一边修改。除初中三年级和高中三年级两班的教材应照顾升学考试外，其他班级的教材，都可以自己编写，争取在今年暑期通过评比，确定一套各种课程的新教材。
