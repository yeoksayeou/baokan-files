Large-Scale Purchasing and Selling, Reforming Systems, Promoting a Great Leap Forward in Production
By Our Correspondent

Large-scale purchasing and selling, making every effort to promote the great leap forward in local industry and agricultural production, and enabling commercial work to play a greater role in the development of the entire national economy, is an arduous political task for the vast number of employees in supply and marketing service departments during the Great Leap Forward.

The central link in the commercial sector's support for industrial and agricultural production is to do a good job in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. This can not only meet the needs of the market, exports, and industry for raw materials, but also find funds for local industrial and agricultural construction. For example, the realization of agricultural mechanization in Liaoning Province requires 2 to 3 billion yuan in funds, which must be accumulated by the agricultural cooperatives themselves. According to preliminary estimates, as long as the commercial sector actively supports the production of agricultural and sideline industries through large-scale purchasing and selling, it can greatly increase farmers' incomes and completely solve the funding problems required for agricultural mechanization. Zunhua County in Hebei Province will produce one million pigs by the end of this year. As long as the commercial sector purchases 60,000 pigs, the county can use these funds to build a fertilizer factory with an annual output of 8,000 tons. As for the wild animals and plants, small native products, and scattered waste and groceries in the mountains, they are everywhere. As long as the commercial sector strengthens investigation and research and finds more ways to find sales channels for these things and process them, it can turn useless into useful, increase wealth for society, and increase a large amount of production funds for farmers. On the other hand, with the great leap forward in agricultural production, the demand for means of production in agriculture will greatly increase in both variety and quantity. The quality of the commercial sector's supply of means of production directly affects this year's agricultural production.

How can this important task be achieved? Further strengthening the production perspective, political perspective, and mass perspective by comrades in commercial work is the ideological guarantee for achieving the above-mentioned tasks. Over the past few years, supply and marketing service departments have made great achievements in completing national procurement tasks and meeting the needs of the vast number of farmers for means of production and living, but there are also many shortcomings. The root cause of the shortcomings and errors in the work lies in the fact that many people have a very one-sided view of commercial work, believing that commercial work is nothing more than doing business, circling around the five words "purchase, sell, transfer, store, and profit" all day long. As for what these words are for, they cannot answer. These comrades do not see or do not clearly understand the great role of commercial work in promoting industrial and agricultural production and promoting socialist undertakings. This purely business view that does not care about politics and production will inevitably promote the development of capitalist business ideology and localism. We often see that many commercial departments always consider whether there is a market or whether they will lose money when it comes to commodity management; if there is a market, they will operate, if there is no market, they will not operate, if it is easy to sell, they will operate more, if it is not easy to sell, they will operate less; if there is profit, they will operate actively, if there is no profit, they will operate passively; disputes and wrangling between commercial departments for sources of goods and profits also occur constantly. There are many considerations, but less consideration is given to how to promote industrial and agricultural production. Is this the operating style of socialist commerce?

Some people believe that commercial work has nothing to do with production. This understanding is obviously wrong. The foundation of commerce is production. Only when production develops and expands can commercial work develop and expand accordingly. Without the development of production, commercial work will definitely not be done well. The task of commercial workers on the ideological front is to oppose the purely business view, oppose capitalist and localist ideas, and clearly establish the view of serving production. Commercial work starts from the entire economic undertaking and does its best to support production, which also specifically reflects the political and mass perspective.

The agricultural and sideline product procurement plan for the first quarter of this year was not completed well. This situation should arouse the attention of all employees. It is necessary to vigorously carry out procurement business on the basis of raising ideological understanding: all products produced by farmers, except for grain, oil, and other unified purchase and sales materials, must be actively purchased. The practice of some departments being afraid of stockpiling and not daring to continue purchasing after temporarily purchasing some products should be changed, because the current problem is not that there are too many agricultural and sideline products. If there are indeed too many in a certain time and place, they should also be purchased and stored. For things that do not have sales channels temporarily, we must try our best to find sales channels. We should be determined to buy everything that is sold, collect it as it is sold, never stop all year round, and meet the needs of farmers to sell. We must also adopt a variety of pre-purchase methods such as cash or in-kind to meet the needs of the masses. The supply of means of production, especially new agricultural tools, must be done well. It is absolutely not enough to just sell new agricultural tools. We must go to the countryside with agricultural tools, spare parts, and technology, contract by area, and guarantee repairs and teaching, so that the various new agricultural tools supplied can give full play to their role in production. Commercial department staff must also work with agricultural departments to strengthen various technical guidance, such as preventing and controlling pests and diseases and livestock epidemics, improving varieties, and promoting advanced farming techniques. The better these tasks are done, the more guaranteed the development and expansion of purchasing and sales business will be.

Reforming some of the existing unreasonable systems in the commercial sector, especially vigorously dredging and reducing commodity circulation links, is of great significance to promoting production. The unreasonable phenomenon of too many commodity circulation links exists seriously in the commercial sector and must be changed quickly. If the supply and marketing service system of Longhui County, Hunan Province, eliminates unnecessary links and the county and agricultural cooperatives are linked for purchasing and supply, it can save more than 1.3 million yuan in commodity circulation costs, which can be used to build two egg factories, two preserved meat factories, a winery, and a sugar factory. As for the streamlined personnel, they can be put into industrial and agricultural production to create wealth for the country.

In the Two-Anti Movement, the commercial sector has continuously exposed serious unreasonable phenomena in finance and accounting, statistics, pricing, business, capital construction, and rules and regulations. Some outdated rules and regulations have already bound the enthusiasm of the masses and become obstacles to carrying out purchasing and sales business, which must be reformed once and for all. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to use their brains, dare to break with conventions, and establish new rules and regulations that are conducive to production and consumption and conducive to stimulating the enthusiasm of employees.

    大购大销，改革制度，促进生产大跃进
    本报评论员
    大购大销，全力促进地方工业和农业生产大跃进，使商业工作在发展整个国民经济中发挥更大的作用，这是供销服务部门广大职工在大跃进中一项艰巨的政治任务。
    商业部门支援工、农业生产的中心一环是全力做好农副产品的收购工作，这不仅可以满足市场、出口和工业上对原料的需要，同时还可以为地方工业和农业建设找到资金。例如在辽宁全省实现农业机械化，需要二十到三十亿元资金，这批资金要靠农业社自己积累。据初步估计，商业部门只要通过大购大销，积极支持农副业生产，就能大大增加农民收入，全部解决实现农业机械化所需的资金问题。河北省遵化县到今年年底将生产一百万头猪，商业部门只要收购六万头，全县就可用这笔资金兴建一座年产八千吨的化肥工厂。至于山区的野生动植物、小土产以及散处在民间的废品杂货，到处都有，商业部门只要加强调查研究，多想办法为这些东西寻找销路，进行加工，就可以变无用为有用，为社会增加财富，为农民增加很大一笔生产资金。另一方面，随着农业生产的大跃进，农业对生产资料的需求不论在品种和数量上都将有很大的增加。商业部门生产资料供应工作做得好坏，更直接影响着今年的农业生产。
    怎样实现这项重要任务呢？商业工作的同志们进一步加强生产观点、政治观点和群众观点是实现上述任务的思想保证。供销服务部门几年来在完成国家采购任务以及满足广大农民对生产生活资料的需求上做出了巨大成绩，但也存在着不少缺点。而工作中的缺点和错误其根源在于不少人对商业工作的看法上有很大的片面性，认为商业工作不过是做买卖，整天在“购、销、调、存、赚”五个字里边打圈子，至于这几个字究竟为了什么，则答不上来。这些同志看不见或者不明确商业工作对于促进工、农业生产，促进社会主义事业的巨大作用，这种不过问政治不关心生产的单纯业务观点必然会助长资本主义经营思想和本位主义思想的发展。我们常看到有许多商业部门对待商品经营的态度总是先考虑有没有销路，会不会亏本；有销路的就经营，没有销路的就不经营，好销的就多经营，不好销的就少经营；有利就积极经营，无利就消极经营；商业部门之间为了货源和利润，互相争吵扯皮的事情也就不断发生。各种考虑都很多，然而就是对如何促进工、农业生产考虑得比较少。这难道是社会主义商业的经营作风吗？
    有人认为商业工作和生产无关，这种认识显然是错误的。商业的基础是生产，只有生产发展了，扩大了，商业工作才能相应地得到发展和扩大，离开了生产的发展，商业工作就一定不会搞好。商业工作者在思想战线上的任务就是要反对单纯业务观点，反对资本主义和本位主义思想，明确地树立起为生产服务的观点，商业工作从整个经济事业出发竭尽全力支持生产，也就具体地体现了政治观点和群众观点。
    今年第一季度农副产品采购计划完成得不好，这种情况应该引起全体职工的重视。必须在提高思想认识的基础上大力开展收购业务：凡是农民生产出来的产品，除了粮食、油料等统购统销物资以外都要积极收购，有些部门暂时多收了一些产品就怕积压而不敢继续收购的作法应该改变，因为当前农、副产品不是多了的问题，如果在一时一地确是多了也应当收购起来加以贮存保管。对于暂时没有销路的东西要千方百计地找销路。应该抱定宗旨做到有卖必买，随卖随收，四季不停，满足农民出售要求。还要采用现金或实物等多种预购方式，以适应群众需要。对于生产资料特别是新式农具的供应工作必须做好，绝不能把新式农具卖出去就完事。要带农具、带零件、带技术下乡，分片包干，包修包教，让供应出去的各种新式农具在生产中充分发挥作用。商业部门工作人员还必须协同农业部门加强各种技术指导工作，如防治病虫害和牲畜疫病，改良品种，推广先进的耕作技术等等。这些工作做得愈好，购销业务的发展和扩大也就愈有保证。
    商业部门对目前存在的一些不合理制度进行改革，特别是大力疏浚和减少商品流转环节，对于促进生产具有重要意义。商品流转环节过多的不合理现象在商业部门是严重存在的，必须迅速改变。湖南隆回县供销服务系统如果撤销掉不必要的环节，由县和农业社挂钩收购和供应，就可以节约商品流转费用一百三十多万元，用这笔资金可以兴建两个蛋厂，两个腊肉厂，一个酿酒厂和一个食糖厂。至于精简下来的人员更可以投入工农业生产里去，为国家创造财富。
    商业部门在双反运动中不断地揭露出在财会、计统、物价、业务、基本建设、规章制度方面严重的不合理现象。有些陈旧的规章制度已经束缚了群众的积极性，成了开展购销业务的障碍，必须来一次改革。要发动群众开动脑筋，敢于打破陈规，并建立起新的、有利于生产和消费，有利于刺激职工积极性的规章制度。
