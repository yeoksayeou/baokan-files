Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 6th: In recent days, the people of Andong City have been welcoming a powerful artillery unit, one of the first detachments of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to return home, day and night. This artillery unit used cannons donated by the people of the motherland to dig many graves for the American invading army and its accomplice troops on the Korean battlefield.

Whenever the train carrying these heroic artillerymen and their magnificent cannons passed over the Yalu River Bridge, the welcoming crowds surged forward, waving red flags and flowers.

When the train stopped at the station, the welcoming people lifted the artillerymen from the train, warmly shaking hands and embracing them, and then launched various consolation and celebration activities on the platform. The "Young Pioneers" from Fumin Street Primary School surrounded Yang Shinan, a combat hero of the Volunteer Army, asking him to tell stories of defeating the American army. When Yang Shinan recounted how, in one counterattack, he commanded an artillery company to fire just one volley of shells and rout an enemy battalion, the children were so happy that they jumped and clapped, enthusiastically putting several red scarves on him.

When the leading organ of this artillery unit arrived in Andong, the leading Party and government officials, headed by Duan Yongjie, Secretary of the Andong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Mayor of Andong, went to greet them and held a forum with the artillery commanders and heroic veterans.

To express their gratitude to the people of the motherland, this artillery unit presented a pot of "Rose of Sharon," a gift from heroic comrades-in-arms of the Korean People's Army, to the people of Andong, so that it would forever bloom on the north bank of the Yalu River.

This artillery unit was also warmly welcomed by the Korean people and Korean People's Army comrades-in-arms along the way from its station to Sinuiju.

    志愿军一支炮兵部队回国
    安东人民连日欢迎并展开联欢活动
    据新华社安东6日电　连日来，安东市人民不分昼夜欢迎中国人民志愿军首批归国部队的一支强大的炮兵部队。这支炮兵部队用祖国人民捐献的大炮，在朝鲜战场上给美国侵略军及其帮凶军挖掘了许多坟墓。
    每当载着这些英雄的炮兵和雄伟的大炮的列车驶过鸭绿江桥来的时候，欢迎的人群涌上前去，挥舞着红旗和鲜花。
    当列车在车站停下后，欢迎的人们就把炮兵们从车上抬下来，热烈地握手、拥抱，接着在月台上展开各种慰问和联欢活动。福民街小学的“红领巾”们围着志愿军战斗英雄杨世南，请他讲打败美军的战斗故事。当杨世南讲到他在一次反击战中，指挥一个炮兵连仅仅发射一排炮弹，就击溃了敌人一个营的故事时，孩子们高兴得又跳又鼓掌，七手八脚地给他戴上了好几条红领巾。
    在这支炮兵部队的领导机关到达安东时，以中共安东市委书记、安东市长段永杰为首的党政负责人都前往迎接，并且同炮兵指挥员、英雄功臣们一起举行了座谈会。
    为了表达对祖国人民的感激，这支炮兵部队把英雄的朝鲜人民军战友赠送给他们的一盆“无穷花”，献给了安东市人民，让它永远盛开在鸭绿江的北岸。
    这支炮兵部队在从驻地到达新义州的途中，也受到沿途朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军战友的热情欢送。
