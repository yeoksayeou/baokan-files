Work Diligently
Tian Lianqian

Hundreds of thousands of rural work cadres have left their offices and gone deep into agricultural cooperatives to cultivate experimental plots, leading production from within production. This is an important guarantee for the great leap forward in agricultural production this year. Now, more and more experimental plots have become banners driving the masses to promote advanced technologies and implement intensive cultivation. However, according to inspections in various places, there are still a few rural cadres who talk more than they do in this matter, or even just shout slogans without taking action. Some have marked out their experimental plots but have not gone to the fields; others have not adopted advanced farming techniques or other yield-increasing measures on their experimental plots to demonstrate to the masses; some are even lagging behind the masses in production activities. This shows that some comrades do not yet fully understand the significance of cultivating experimental plots.

Cadres cultivating experimental plots is of decisive significance for improving production leadership. But it is not enough to just plant them casually to lead production well. This depends first on the attitude people take towards the experimental plots: Do they consciously and diligently put their labor and effort into the experimental plots, or are they just reluctantly fulfilling a task? No advanced leadership method or work experience can blossom and bear fruit without people's subjective efforts. If experimental plots are to achieve the expected results, they also require people's subjective efforts. Last year, cadres in Hong'an and other places developed production by cultivating experimental plots because they made serious efforts. If comrades in other places want to promote production using this method this year, they need to make new efforts this year. All good experiences are condensed from hard work. For these experiences to blossom and bear fruit in any new time and place, new labor is needed. Cultivating experimental plots involves not only hard physical labor but also hard mental labor. In addition to being diligent in moving hands and feet, one must also be diligent in using one's brain. This is a necessary condition for our cadres to transform from being half-knowledgeable about production to becoming red experts, and it is also a necessary condition for transforming our backward agriculture into advanced socialist agriculture.

In addition to ideological and attitudinal issues, there are also specific practical issues. Some cadres are cultivating a plot together with several people, becoming detached from the production activities of the masses; others are each selecting a plot and working independently, with everyone planting the same crop, which makes it impossible to absorb experience from multiple aspects and guide the production of various crops; still others are selecting a top-quality field and applying a large amount of fertilizer, so the crops grow very well, but the masses are not convinced. Experience has shown that these practices are not very good. The best approach is for cadres to cooperate with the masses (preferably with the participation of technicians), consult with the masses to select appropriate fields, plant a variety of representative crops, and combine advanced measures with the experience of the masses. Only in this way can we effectively guide production.

    要认真干
    田连阡
    成千上万的农村工作干部走出了办公室，深入到农业合作社去种试验田，从生产中领导生产，这是今年农业生产大跃进的重要保证。现在，越来越多的试验田成了带动群众推行先进技术、实行精耕细作的旗帜。但是根据各地检查，也还有少数农村干部在这件事情上讲得多做得少，甚至光喊不做。其中有的是划定了自己的试验田，但一直没有下田；有的是没有在试验田上采用先进的耕作技术和别的增产措施，向群众示范；有的在生产活动上甚至比群众落后。这说明有些同志对种试验田的意义还不很了解。
    干部种试验田，对改进生产领导具有决定意义。但并不是随便怎样种一下就能把生产领导好。这首先要看人们用什么态度来对待试验田：是自觉地勤勤恳恳地在试验田上付出自己的劳力和心血呢？还是勉强支应差事？任何一个先进的领导方法和工作经验，都不能离开人们的主观努力而开花结果。试验田要想得到预期的效果，同样需要人的主观努力。去年红安等地的干部种试验田发展了生产，是因为他们作了认真的努力。今年别的地方的同志们要想用这方法推进生产，就需要在今年作新的努力。一切好的经验，都是辛勤的劳动凝结成的。这些经验要在任何新的时间和地点开花结果，都需要外加新的劳动。种试验田不但包含着辛勤的体力劳动，还包含着辛勤的脑力劳动。除了勤于动手动腿，还要勤于动脑。这是我们的干部从对生产一知半解到成为红色专家的转变所必需的条件，也是把我国落后的农业改造成先进的社会主义农业所必需的条件。
    除了思想和态度问题，还有具体的做法问题。现在有的干部是几个人共种一块，与群众的生产活动脱离；有的是每人各选一块，各搞各的，大家种的都是同一种庄稼，这就不能多方面地吸取经验，指导各种作物的生产；有的是选择一块最上等田，大量施肥，庄稼长得很好，群众却不服气。经验证明，这些做法都不很好。最好的做法是：干部跟群众合作（最好再吸收技术人员参加），同群众商量选择适当的田，种植多种有代表性的作物，并使先进措施和群众经验相结合。这样，才能有力地指导生产。
