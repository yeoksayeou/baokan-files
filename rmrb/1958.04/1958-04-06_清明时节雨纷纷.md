    Rain, Rain, Rain at Qingming Festival
    Liu Yang
    "Rain, rain, rain during the Qingming Festival, travelers on the road feel lost and forlorn," This is an ancient poem depicting the scenery of Jiangnan - the Qingming rain.
    Why does it often drizzle around Qingming Festival? This is because around Qingming, the Yangtze River basin area receives more and more sunlight, and the temperature rises faster. In addition, the warm and humid air from the southeast sea blows in, making the warm air in this area very active. At the same time, the influence of the dry and cold air flowing southward in the Yangtze River basin is also not weak. When these cold and warm air currents meet, they fight. Because the warm and humid air from the south is high in temperature and light, and the dry and cold air from the north is low in temperature and heavy, the humid and light air is lifted and rises by the dry, cold, and heavy air. When the warm air climbs to a high altitude, it cools down and the temperature drops, and the water vapor condenses, forming clouds and rain. If the cold air from the north cannot gain a decisive advantage and drive the warm air back to the sea, then the stalemate between the two will last longer, and the continuous rain will last longer.
    There is more rain around Qingming, but it is not necessary to rain every year at this time, nor is it always continuous for three or five days. If the dry and cold air flowing southward is weak, and the warm and humid air from the south is strong, it can continue to blow northward, and the front where the two air currents meet will be north of the Yangtze River. At this time, the Yangtze River basin will have sunny weather without rain. If the dry and cold air flowing southward is particularly strong, and the warm and humid air from the south is weak, the formed front may not be in the Yangtze River basin but in areas further south. If the two air currents cannot "fight", it will no longer rain.
    The rainfall around Qingming is good for the growth of seedlings and the planting of vegetables, so people often say "spring rain is as precious as oil".

    清明时节雨纷纷
    刘扬
    “清明时节雨纷纷，路上行人欲断魂”，这是古诗对江南景色——清明雨的写照。
    清明前后为什么老是细雨纷飞呢？这是因为清明前后，长江流域一带受到太阳照射的时间愈来愈多，气温升高较快，再加上东南海上的温暖潮湿的空气的吹袭，使这一带的暖空气很活跃。与此同时，北下的干冷气流在长江流域的势力也并不弱。当这冷、暖气流相遇后，便发生了搏斗。由于南来的湿热气流温度高而轻，北下干冷气流温度低而重，湿热而轻的气流被干冷而重的气流抬举上升。暖空气爬升到高空后，受冷而温度下降，水汽凝结，形成了云雨。如果北下的冷空气不能占压倒优势而把暖空气赶下海去，那么，两者相持的局面就会更久，霪雨时日就愈长。
    清明前后多雨，但不是每年在这个时候都必须下雨，也不是每次都要有连续三、五天的绵绵细雨。假若北下干冷气流微弱，南来的温湿气流强大，可以继续向北吹送，两种气流交接的锋面将在长江以北，这时长江流域将是无雨的晴天。假若北下干冷气流特别强大，南来的湿热气流微弱，形成的锋面也可能不在长江流域而在更南一些地区。假若两种气流不能发生“搏斗”，也就不再下雨。
    清明前后的降雨，对禾苗的成长，菜蔬的种植都有好处，所以人们常说“春雨贵如油”。
