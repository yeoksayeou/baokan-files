    Xinhua News Agency, London, April 9th: As more news of unemployment emerges from the United States, fear and unease continue to grow here regarding the impact of the American economic recession on Britain.
    Although Britain's gold and dollar reserves have increased and its export trade has slightly improved recently, no one here believes that this temporary situation will last for long.
    Economists here point out that a major factor in the current increase in British export trade is the large sales of British cars in the United States. This is because American buyers are finding it increasingly difficult to buy large, expensive American cars, and they need to buy small, inexpensive cars manufactured in Britain and other European countries. However, this trend is bound to change, as British cars are expected to face competition from the American auto industry (which will also produce small cars).
    Another factor contributing to the increase in the total value of British export trade is the fall in the prices of raw materials imported from abroad (including Commonwealth countries) as a result of the American economic recession. However, this situation will soon have a reverse effect, as raw material producing countries will inevitably have to cut back on imports of manufactured goods from Britain in order to overcome their difficulties.
    The number of unemployed workers in the United States continues to increase, and "breadlines" have appeared in many industrial cities in the United States. This is a line of unemployed workers and their families queuing for bread on a street in Biddeford, Maine. (Xinhua News Agency draft)

    美国经济情况愈来愈糟
    英国恐慌情绪增长
    据新华社伦敦9日电　由于美国传出更多失业的消息，这里对于美国经济衰退对英国的影响所感到的恐惧和不安继续增长。
    虽然英国的黄金美元储备有了增加、出口贸易的情况近来稍有好转，但是这里并没有人认为这种暂时状况会长期持续下去。
    这里的经济学家们指出，目前英国出口贸易增加的一个主要因素，就是英国汽车在美国的大量销售。这是因为美国买主要购买大型的价格昂贵的美国汽车越来越感到困难，他们需要购买英国和其他欧洲国家制造的小型的价格便宜的汽车。但是，这种趋势一定要发生变化，因为可以预料英国汽车将要遇到美国汽车工业（它们也将生产小型汽车）的竞争。
    促使英国出口贸易总值增加的另一个因素是，由于美国经济衰退的结果，从外国（包括英联邦国家）输入的原料价格下跌。但是这种情况不久就会发生反作用，因为生产原料国家为了克服它们的困难，势必要削减从英国输入的制成品。
    美国失业工人的人数还在继续增加，在美国许多工业城市中都出现了“面包队”。这是缅因州毕德福特城大街上失业工人和家属排队领取面包的队伍。　（新华社稿）
