Agricultural Crop Disease and Pest Situation

    This Year's Pest Characteristics:
    Large Numbers, Early Occurrence
    Since the beginning of spring, various crop diseases and pests have begun to be active. Judging from the situation in various regions, the characteristics of this year's pests are: large numbers and early occurrence.
    Wheat aphids and wheat spider mites have already occurred in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, and other places. In Hubei Province, more than 20 counties have experienced wheat aphids, wireworms, wheat spider mites, and wheat scab, affecting an area of approximately 6 million mu, accounting for 15% of the province's summer harvest crop area.
    Armyworms and cutworms have generally entered their peak moth emergence period in Jiangsu, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Guizhou, Xinjiang, and other regions, and larvae have already begun to harm crops in some areas. According to inspections by the LinYi Disease and Pest Prediction and Forecasting Station in Shandong, the amount of armyworm moth emergence is 113 times higher than the same period last year, and cutworms have increased by 112 times. Armyworm moths were also discovered in Liaoning in early April, occurring five days earlier than last year.
    Due to the higher temperatures last winter, the overwintering mortality rate of rice stem borers in the southern rice-growing provinces is generally very low, and the pupation progress is relatively rapid. In Liuzhou, Guangxi, the emergence of the first generation of rice stem borer moths was 25 days earlier than last year; in Jiangjin, Sichuan, the amount of moth emergence increased by 40% compared to last year.
    The overwintering survival rate of wheat blossom midges larvae in the soil is very high in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and other provinces. According to investigations and analysis in Shaanxi Province, the emergence from the soil may be advanced, the emergence of adults will be more concentrated, and the occurrence period will be short.
    The overwintering egg base of cotton aphids is relatively high in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces, and the hatching period is about a week earlier. Anyang in Henan Province and Heze in Shandong Province have issued forecasts, unanimously pointing out that aphid damage during the cotton seedling stage will be more severe than in 1956 and 1957. If prevention and control measures are not taken, it is predicted that in early June, the aphid infestation rate in general sown cotton fields will reach 100%, and the leaf curl rate will reach over 90%.

### 今年虫害特点：数量多　发生早

    今年虫害特点：
    数量多　发生早
    入春以来，多种农作物病虫已经开始活动。从各地情况看，今年的虫害特点是：数量多，发生早。
    麦蚜及麦蜘蛛已在陕西、山西、山东等地发生。湖北省有二十多个县发生麦蚜、金针虫、麦蜘蛛、小麦赤霉病，受害面积约计六百多万亩，占该省夏收作物面积的15％。
    粘虫、地老虎在江苏、山东、山西、河南、贵州、新疆等地已普遍进入发蛾盛期，部分地区已有幼虫开始为害。据山东临沂病虫害预测预报站检查，粘虫发蛾量比去年同期高出一百一十三倍，地老虎增加一百一十二倍；辽宁4月初也发现了粘虫蛾，比去年提前发生五天。
    由于去冬气温较高，南方稻区各省螟虫的越冬死亡率大都很低，化蛹进度比较迅速。广西柳州第一代三化螟蛾的出现比去年提前二十五天；四川江津的发蛾量比去年增大40％。
    江苏、陕西、山西等省小麦吸浆虫土内幼虫的越冬成活率都很高，据陕西省调查分析，羽化出土时期可能提前，成虫羽化将比较集中，发生期短。
    山西、陕西等省的棉蚜越冬卵基数均较高，孵化期约提前了一周左右。河南省安阳及山东省菏泽已发出预报，一致指出今年棉苗期蚜害将比1956、1957两年严重；如不进行防治，预测在6月上旬一般播种期棉田有蚜株率将达100％，卷叶株率可达90％以上。
