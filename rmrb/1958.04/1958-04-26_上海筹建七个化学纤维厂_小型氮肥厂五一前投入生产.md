Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 25th. Shanghai is stepping up preparations for the construction of seven chemical fiber plants. They are: a viscose fiber plant with an annual output of 30,000 tons of viscose fiber and 1,000 tons of cellophane, a capron yarn spinning plant with an annual output of 10,000 tons of capron yarn, a polyacrylonitrile yarn spinning plant with an annual output of 3,600 tons, as well as polyester yarn spinning plant, a cellulose acetate plant, and a nylon 66 yarn spinning plant.

The preparatory offices for the construction of each plant have been established. Cadres and engineering technicians drawn from various fields are working intensively on collecting data, designing, training workers and technicians, and conducting experimental research. These factories will all be completed before 1960.

This newspaper reports: A small-scale nitrogen fertilizer plant, intended to set an example for the nationwide "stars in the sky" development of the chemical fertilizer industry, has emerged in Shanghai. This plant will begin production before May Day.

This pilot plant, with an annual output of 8,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, was commissioned by the Ministry of Chemical Industry to be built by the Shanghai Chemical Research Institute. It has taken less than one and a half months from groundbreaking to the start of production.

The raw materials required by this factory are inexhaustible air and a small amount of coke (or anthracite coal). Most of the production process is automated and mechanized. The total investment is less than three million yuan.

    上海筹建七个化学纤维厂
    小型氮肥厂五一前投入生产
    新华社上海25日电　上海正在加紧筹建七个化学纤维厂。它们是：年产三万吨粘胶纤维和一千吨透明纸的粘胶纤维厂、年产一万吨卡普隆丝的卡普隆拉丝厂、年产三千六百吨的聚丙烯腈拉丝厂、以及涤纶拉丝厂、醋酸纤维厂和尼隆六六拉丝厂。
    各厂的建厂筹备处已经成立。从各方面抽调来的干部和工程技术人员，正在紧张地进行收集资料、设计、培训工人和技术人员，以及试验研究等工作。这些工厂都将在1960年前建成。
    本报讯　为全国“满天星斗”建设化学肥料工业做示范的小型氮肥厂，已经在上海市出现了。这家厂将在“五一”前投入生产。
    这座年产八千吨氮肥的试验工厂是化学工业部委托上海化工研究院筹建的，从破土动工到现在还不到一个半月。
    这座工厂所需要的原料是取之不尽的空气和少量焦炭（或无烟煤）。生产过程大部是自动化和机械化的。全部投资却不到三百万元。
