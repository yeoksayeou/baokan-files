Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 17th:  Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage arrived in Warsaw by special train this afternoon.

Those who went to the station to welcome the distinguished guests included Polish United Workers' Party and state leaders Gomulka, Zawadzki, Cyrankiewicz, prominent figures from all walks of life in Poland, diplomatic envoys from various countries to Poland, and representatives of the masses in Warsaw.

Voroshilov, accompanied by Polish State Council Chairman Zawadzki, reviewed the guard of honor.  Then, the Soviet guests participated in a mass welcoming rally held in the square in front of the station.

Zawadzki delivered a welcoming speech at the rally, saying that the arrival of the Soviet guests coincided with the thirteenth anniversary of the signing of the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Cooperation, which formed an unbreakable alliance between Poland and the Soviet Union.  Under the protection of this alliance, the Polish people, led by the working class and its political party, have consolidated their independence and their country, and are now striving to realize the great cause of socialist construction.

Zawadzki emphasized that the Polish working class is firmly fighting for the consolidation of the people's democratic regime and for the unity of the socialist camp.

Voroshilov then spoke, saying, "We are visiting Poland as old friends and brothers. Our two peoples once fought side by side against a common enemy. Common interests, common goals, and a common new ideology and principles unite our two peoples."

He said, "Now, People's Poland, together with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, is tenaciously fighting for human peace and security. The true friendship and fraternal mutual assistance between the Soviet Union, Poland, and all socialist countries give us strong strength and are a guarantee for our great new achievements."

After the mass rally, Voroshilov, accompanied by Zawadzki, rode in an open-top car to his residence. Despite the light rain, thousands of citizens still lined the streets to pay their respects to Chairman Voroshilov.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 17th: Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage today paid visits to Polish State Council Chairman Zawadzki, Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee First Secretary Gomulka, and Polish Council of Ministers Chairman Cyrankiewicz.

Subsequently, Zawadzki, Gomulka, and Cyrankiewicz paid a return visit to Voroshilov.

Today, Chairman Voroshilov and others attended the Fourth National Congress of Polish Trade Unions.
