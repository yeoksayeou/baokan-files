    Special Material
    Wu Xu

    Generally speaking, emphasizing the "special" is undesirable. The kind of thinking that particularly places oneself in a special position and demands special treatment is even more undesirable. Stalin once said that communists are made of special material. Is there anything wrong with this statement? No. This "special" and that "special" are fundamentally different. I once saw a letter, very short, which I transcribe below:

    "To Comrade So-and-so: Since a person becomes a Communist Party member, it means that his existence is entirely for the ideal of the Party and the cause of the Party. His entire life should be consumed in socialist construction and the realization of communism. Here, there can be no room for even a little bit of personal consideration. Self-transformation and ideological transformation are not only needed by Communist Party members as much as by non-Party members, but also should have higher requirements. That is to completely change the thinking of personal considerations, without leaving a trace. So-and-so encourages himself in a certain year, month, and day."

    This is what So-and-so wrote on his own photo and sent to his comrade. Dedicating one's entire life to the cause of socialism and communism, without leaving any personal considerations, can probably be used as a footnote to "special material." So, what's wrong with this? However, it is said that some people are very unconvinced by this. Why? Because Communist Party members cannot really do this? There have already been countless Communist Party members like Li Dazhao, Fang Zhimin, Li Qiushi, Yun Daiying, and Chen Tanqiu. Now, there are even more Communist Party members who can truly do this in the army, factories, countryside, and government offices. Is it that not all Communist Party members can be like this? Then, our Party is asking all non-Party members to supervise those Party members who cannot yet do this, and to demand that they do so. Instead of urging, but being unconvinced, is probably only because with the existence of such special material, one feels a little uncomfortable in comparison.

    特殊材料

    强调特殊，一般说来是要不得的。特别把自己摆在特殊地位上要求特殊待遇的那种思想，更是要不得。斯大林曾说共产党人是由特殊材料做成的。这话是否有毛病？没有。这个特殊和那个特殊有本质上的区别。曾看到一封信，很简短，抄录如下：
    “某某同志：一个人既然成了共产党员，那就是说，他的存在完全是为了党的理想、党的事业而存在的了。他的全部生命都应当消费在社会主义的建设、共产主义的实现上面去。这里，再不能有半点个人打算的容身之地。自我改造、思想改造，共产党员不只与非党员一样需要，而且还应有更高的要求。那就是要把个人打算的思想完全改掉，不留丝毫。　某年某月某某自勖”
    这是某某题在自己的照片上寄给他的同志的。把全部生命都交给社会主义和共产主义事业，不留半点个人打算，大概可以作为特殊材料的注脚吧。那么，这有什么不好呢？然而，据说，有些人对此很不服气。为什么？因为共产党人并不能真的做到这样么？像李大钊、方志敏、李求实、恽代英、陈潭秋这样的共产党人已不知有了多少。现在部队里、工厂里、农村里、机关里确能做到这样的共产党人更不知有多少。说是所有共产党人并不能个个都是这样吗？那么，我们的党正在要求一切党外人士对还不能做到这样的党员进行监督，要求他做到。不是督促，倒是不服气，怕只能是因为有了这样一种特殊材料存在，自己在相形之下，有点不自在的缘故吧。
