Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 31st—Henan Province has continuously overcome late frosts, ensuring the healthy growth of summer crops. On March 26th and 28th, temperatures dropped across Henan, with late frosts occurring in all areas except the southeastern part of the Xinyang Special District. After receiving frost warnings, the Luoyang Special District, from the commissioner's office to the agricultural cooperatives, established overnight frost prevention headquarters, mobilizing more than 11,000 cadres to lead 1.1 million farmers in lighting fires and creating smoke in the fields. In Mengjin, Xin’an, Luoning, and Lushi counties alone, over 2.7 million fires were lit overnight to generate smoke, filling all wheat fields with smog until dawn. Farmers in Baofeng County, based on years of frost prevention experience, sprinkled dust and plant ash on the wheat seedlings, which also yielded significant results.

    河南战胜晚霜
    据新华社郑州31日电　河南省连续战胜晚霜，保证夏收作物健旺生长。3月26日和28日，河南各地温度下降，除信阳专区的东南部以外，其余都下了晚霜。洛阳专区在接到霜冻警报后，从专署到农业社都星夜建立防霜指挥部，发动一万一千多名干部带领一百一十万农民在田间点火熏烟。仅孟津、新安、洛宁、卢氏四县，一夜便点火熏烟二百七十多万处，所有麦田都烟雾弥漫，直到天亮。宝丰县农民根据历年防霜经验，在麦苗上洒尘土和草木灰，也收到了显著的效果。
