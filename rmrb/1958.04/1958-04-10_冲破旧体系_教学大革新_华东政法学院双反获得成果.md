Breaking Through the Old System: A Revolution in Teaching
East China Institute of Political Science and Law Achieves Results in the "Double Anti" Campaign

(Our dispatch) The East China Institute of Political Science and Law, after several months of major rectification and reforms, has taken on a vibrant new look.

From the very beginning of the rectification phase, the Party and government leadership of the school firmly grasped the most central aspect of the school: teaching. Since the launch of the "Double Anti" movement, under the resounding slogan of "Attack the conservative mountains, seize the teaching link; support large-scale production, strive for both red and expert," the masses were mobilized without restraint. Within three days, 350,000 big-character posters appeared. The school promptly organized a meeting of teacher and student representatives, vigorously promoted teaching reform, and launched a profound socialist political and legal education revolution.

In the past, students were most critical of the school's teaching leadership for not managing teaching effectively. Because Dean Xu Panqiu frequently "floated outside" engaging in "secondary occupations," students said, "Moss has grown on the Dean's desk." Teachers also felt that the leadership did not pay close enough attention to teaching, so they had to "act according to their conscience." The teaching content contained old legal viewpoints and revisionism, and the teaching methods exhibited a tendency towards dogmatism. Students also had many opinions about certain teachers who "only managed teaching but not learning" and "taught books but not people." Amidst the giant waves of sweeping away waste and attacking conservatism, leaders and the masses, teachers and students, truly met in thought, exposing the problems existing in all aspects of teaching and learning, and speaking their minds. All teachers and students were determined to dedicate their hearts to the Party and to the masses, and they were determined to teach and learn socialist legal science well.

Tasting the Sweetness of Rectification

At the beginning of the mass-based teaching reform, teachers and students all recognized the need for thorough teaching reform. However, how to reform? Where to start? How to ensure a thorough reform? These key questions related to the success or failure of teaching reform were unclear. The objective situation educated the people that reform must begin with ideology. Only with a great leap forward in thought can there be a great leap forward in teaching reform. Without the determination of Sun Wukong to be tempered in Lao Jun's furnace, teaching reform cannot be successful.

Despite this, the teachers initially had concerns. Some avoided the main issues, fearing to burn themselves; some were afraid of being held accountable, pushing the responsibility onto textbooks; some feared losing face if problems were exposed, making it difficult to teach in the future; some adopted a sarcastic or even confrontational attitude towards students' criticisms. At this time, the school leadership promptly focused on ideological mobilization, explaining the principles on one hand and educating them with facts on the other. Ultimately, it was due to the teachers' inner conscious desire for transformation and the struggle between the two roads in thought that the movement immediately developed vigorously.

With the development of the movement, teachers progressed from having concerns and individual confrontational emotions to feeling the genuine need for transformation and proactively proposing to let the fierce flames of the masses burn away all their shortcomings and errors.

The students automatically formed groups, spread out the lecture notes for each course, and conducted inspections. They deeply exposed the old legal viewpoints, revisionism, and dogmatism in teaching. The students brought the problems they found to meetings to offer criticism and suggestions face-to-face. When making suggestions to teachers, the students adhered to the spirit of unity-criticism-unity, with criticism as well as praise, exposure as well as suggestions in their speeches. The teachers felt that such an attack from the students was very beneficial, allowing for a more profound examination. Huang Dao, the main lecturer for the criminal procedure course, after hearing students expose some of his old legal viewpoints in teaching, suddenly realized, "In the past, I thought that since I had worked in judicial practice, I knew all the procedures for handling cases, and even if I didn't explain things well, I could do them, so how could there be major errors? Through this examination, I realized the seriousness of the problem. This teaching reform solved the fundamental problems that I hadn't resolved for a long time, and it was even more effective than the judicial reform." He Haiyan, a professor of international law, initially doubted whether students could raise any important issues, but when he heard students criticize him for having "pure legal viewpoints" in his lectures, he was surprised. He said, "I never imagined that students could see problems so sharply." After this comradely criticism and self-criticism, teachers and students united on a new basis. Teachers humbly examined themselves and proposed concrete methods for rectification, and students expressed gratitude for the teachers' spirit of humbly accepting opinions and being willing to improve, and promised to study their majors diligently under the guidance of teachers in the future. At this time, the teachers' mood was no longer as heavy as it was at the beginning of the movement, and they truly tasted the sweetness of rectification and felt refreshed. They all believed that this was a painful struggle, but ultimately it was a mentally pleasant ideological struggle. The enthusiasm of the masses was boosted, and new atmospheres and new things emerged continuously.

Breaking Out of the Old Box

An important measure of the institute's teaching innovation was "breaking out of the box and shattering the system." In the past, the phenomenon of "too much theory, too little practice; too much foreign, too little Chinese; too much introduction, too little criticism" in teaching was the result of being unable to break out of the old box. Holding on to the original system makes it impossible to achieve the Sinicization of Marxism-Leninism, which leads to the dogmatic tendency of being divorced from the current actual struggle. In order to ensure that legal science truly serves the practice of political and legal work, the institute first reformed the courses on the theoretical foundations of law and gradually extended it to all courses. Under the personal participation and leadership of Chen Chuangang, the Deputy Dean of the institute, the teachers of the Theory of State and Law Teaching and Research Group first broke with the idea of a "system" that was divorced from reality, streamlined dispensable content, changed the original chapter system, and adopted a method of thematic lectures. The content of the themes was closely integrated with the practice of the Chinese revolution and the vague ideas existing among students, and it was also focused on combining criticism of relevant right-wing fallacies. For example, when lecturing on the theme of "the relationship between law and politics," not only was the basic principle of law serving politics deeply explained, but many fallacies of the right-wing in the political and legal circles were also powerfully refuted, solving many vague viewpoints of students on the scientific nature and class nature of law and the relationship between law and policy. The students all said that this was "shooting the arrow at the target."

Teaching methods also broke with the old-fashioned approach of mechanically following the textbook, inherited the revolutionary tradition of proceeding from reality and implementing the mass line in the old liberated areas, absorbed the democratic methods of the rectification movement, and adopted a method of combining key lectures with systematic learning and combining individual study with collective discussion. After each major class, students were organized in groups to conduct discussions under leadership. The teaching and research group organized joint-class debates after collating and summarizing the dissenting opinions in the discussions. The teachers, based on the debate situation, discovered problems and promptly inspired and guided students to carry out in-depth debates. Problems that could not be resolved in the debate were collectively studied by the teaching and research group and then a unified answer report was made. A democratic style of free debate was established in learning, and students' ability to think independently was developed.

Linking Up

Going deep into reality and linking up with business departments is an effective measure to combine political and legal education with judicial practice. In order to fundamentally solve the teaching problem of theory being divorced from reality, teachers of various legal professional courses in the institute have gone deep into judicial business departments to become students, to prepare vivid lessons, which is indeed a new atmosphere in political and legal education. The teachers of the institute's constitution course moved to the Municipal People's Committee to prepare lessons; the teachers of the court and procuratorate organization law went to the Municipal People's Procuratorate to work as secretaries for the leaders, collecting practical materials from the procuratorial work; and the teachers of the state law course also participated in the rectification movement of ethnic minorities. In particular, the teachers of the civil law course established ties with rural areas and factories; participated in symposiums, visited rural cadres, judicial cadres, and enterprise and government cadres, invited practical workers to give them short lessons, and collected typical cases. They went to the neighborhood to handle cases with the court cadres. In the extensive going deep into reality, they understood the development of civil cases and solved many problems that could not be solved in books. This vivid method of preparing lessons is indeed a major change in teaching. The past method of teachers preparing lessons statically has been broken, and the problem of linking theory with practice, which could not be solved by discussing for a long time in the office, has been solved.

Moving Forward to Becoming Red and Expert

The new situation of the great leap forward after teaching reform is the inevitable result of the development of the rectification movement. At present, all teachers and students of the East China Institute of Political Science and Law are moving forward to the goal of becoming red and expert with a cheerful mood and full of enthusiasm.

Through the climax of teaching reform, all teachers and students in the institute have recognized the current situation and the path they should take, and they all urgently demand to transform themselves into red and expert intellectuals of the working class. While deeply rectifying and reforming, they have automatically revised their personal plans, which has formed a climax of comparing plans, comparing advancedness, and self-transformation. The teachers summarized the gains since the "Double Anti" movement and are determined to dedicate their hearts to the Party and the people. They realized that they cannot be expert without being red, and they cannot be deeply expert without being thoroughly red, so they consciously demand to completely change their political stand and train themselves to become political leftists within three years. The professors said, "The older one gets, the stronger one should be, and one must compete with the young comrades in enthusiasm." Each teaching and research group also automatically formulated three love covenants of loving the country, loving the school, and loving the students. During the process of revising plans, the students also carried out criticism and self-criticism among themselves. Many originally backward students have now transformed into advanced figures. They also created a method of signing "political contracts" to promote each other and improve together. The fourth-year students guaranteed in their plans to 100% obey the state's allocation. At present, the institute is comprehensively carrying out criticism of bourgeois academic thoughts in combination with the main problems exposed in teaching reform, so that teaching reform can further develop in depth.

    冲破旧体系　教学大革新
    华东政法学院双反获得成果
    本报讯　华东政法学院经过几个月来的大整大改，已出现了一个生气勃勃的新面貌。
    这个学校的党政领导，从整改阶段一开始，就紧紧抓住了学校最中心的教学一环。双反运动开展以来，在“猛攻保守山，抓住教学环；支援大生产，奔向红又专”的响亮口号下，放手发动群众，在三天内出现了三十五万张大字报。校内及时组织了师生代表会议，大力进行教学改革，掀起了一次深刻的社会主义政法教育大革新的运动。
    过去，同学们对学校教学领导不管教学的意见最大。由于教务长徐盼秋经常“飘在外面”搞“副业”，同学们说：“教务长的办公台上长了毛了。”教师们也认为领导对教学抓得不紧，只好“凭良心办事”。教学内容上存在着旧法观点和修正主义，教学方法上存在着教条主义的倾向。同学们对某些教师“管教不管学”“教书不教人”的现象，也有很多意见。在横扫浪费、猛攻保守的巨浪中，领导和群众、教师和同学真正地思想见了面，把教和学各方面存在的问题揭露出来了，把心里的话都说出来了。全体师生都坚决地要把心交给党，交给群众，一定要把社会主义法律科学教好学好。
    尝到了整风的甜头
    在群众性的教学改革的开始，师生虽然都认识到必须彻底进行教学改革。但是，怎样改？从哪里改起？怎样才能改得彻底？这些有关教学改革成败的关键问题却是心中无数。客观形势教育了人们，要改，必须从思想上改起。有了思想的大跃进，才会有教学改革的大跃进。不具有孙悟空投到老君炉去受锻炼的决心，教学改革是改不好的。
    尽管如此，教师们开始确是有顾虑的。有的避重就轻不敢放火烧身；有的怕追究责任，把责任推到教科书上去；有的怕将问题检查出来会丢脸，今后不好教学；有的对同学的批评采取冷嘲热讽甚至对抗的态度。这时，学校领导及时抓紧了思想发动工作，一面讲清道理，一面用事实来教育他们，最终地还是由于教师内心自觉地要求改造，进行了思想上的两条道路的斗争以后，运动就立即生气蓬勃地开展起来了。
    随着运动的发展，教师们从有顾虑、个别的有对抗情绪，进而感到确实需要改造，并主动地提出要让群众猛烈的火焰，把自己的一切缺点和错误烧干净。
    同学们则自动地组成小组，摊开各门课程的讲义进行检查。深入地揭发了教学中的旧法观点、修正主义和教条主义的倾向。同学们把检查出来的问题带到会上面对面地提出批评和建议。同学们在对教师提意见时，坚持了团结——批评——团结的精神，发言中有批评，也有表扬，有揭发，也有建议。教师们都感到同学这样冲击一下大有好处，检查才能更深刻。刑事诉讼课主讲教师黄道听到同学揭发了他在教学中的某些旧法观点后，才恍然大悟地说：“以前我认为搞过司法工作，审案子的一套都会，即使讲得不好，我会干，那会有多大错误，通过检查，才感到问题严重。这次教学改革解决了我长期未解决的根本问题，这比在司法改革时的收效还大。”国际法教授何海晏开始也怀疑同学能否提出什么重要问题，当听到同学批评他在讲课中存在“纯法律观点”时，他感到很惊讶。说：“真想不到，同学们看问题这样尖锐”。通过这种同志式的批评与自我批评以后，师生在新的基础上团结起来了。教师虚心检查，提出了整改的具体办法，同学们对教师虚心接受意见勇于改进的精神表示感谢，并保证今后在教师的指导下努力学好专业。这时教师们的心情不再像运动开始时那样沉重了，真正尝到了整风的甜头，感到心情舒畅了。他们都认为这是一场痛苦的斗争，但最后确是精神愉快的思想斗争。群众的干劲鼓起来了，新气象新事物也就不断涌现出来了。
            跳出旧框子
    该院教学革新的一个重要措施是“跳出框子，冲破体系”。过去教学中“理论多、实际少，外国多、中国少，介绍多、批判少”的现象就是跳不出那老框子的结果。抓住原体系不放，就不可能做到马列主义中国化，就会产生脱离当前实际斗争的教条主义倾向。为了做到法律科学真正为政法工作实践服务，该院首先从法律理论基础课程改起，逐渐推广到全部课程。国家与法的理论教研组教师在该院副院长陈传纲同志亲自参加与领导下，首先打破了脱离实际的“体系”思想，精简了可有可无的内容，改变了原来的章节体系，采用了专题讲授的方法。专题的内容都密切结合了中国革命的实践和同学存在的模糊思想，并有重点地结合批判有关右派的谬论，例如讲“法律与政治的关系”这一专题时，不仅深透地讲解了法律为政治服务的基本原理，也有力地驳斥了政法界右派的许多谬论，解决了同学在法律的科学性与阶级性、法律与政策关系上的许多模糊观点。同学们都说，这样才是“有的放矢”地进行教学。
    教学方法也打破了以往墨守陈规，按照教科书照本宣科的老一套的办法，继承了老解放区从实际出发，贯彻群众路线的革命传统，吸取了整风运动的民主方式，采用了重点讲授与系统学习相结合、个人钻研与集体讨论相结合的方法。在每次大课后，有领导地组织学生以小组为单位进行讨论，教研组将讨论中的分歧意见整理归纳后再组织联班辩论，教师根据辩论情况，发现问题及时启发和诱导学生深入开展辩论，辩论中不能解决的问题经教研组集体研究后作出统一的解答报告。在学习中树立了自由争论的民主学风，发挥了学生独立思考的能力。
              挂上了钩
    深入实际，与业务部门挂钩是政法教育与司法实践相结合的有效措施。为了从根本上解决理论脱离实际的教学，该院各法律专业课程的教师都纷纷深入到司法业务部门中去做学生，去备活的课，这确是政法教育中的一个新气象。该院宪法课的教师搬到市人民委员会去备课；法院与检察院组织法的教师到市人民检察院去作首长的秘书工作，收集检察工作中的实际资料；国家法课的教师还参加了少数民族的整风运动。尤其是民法课的教师，他们同农村、工厂建立联系；参加座谈会，访问农村干部、司法干部以及企业机关干部，请实际工作的同志给他们上小课，搜集典型案例。他们和法院干部一起下里弄办案。在广泛的深入实际中，他们了解了民事案件的发展情况，解决了许多书本上不能解决的问题。这种生动的备课方式，确是教学中的一个大的变革。过去教师静止备课的办法打破了，关在办公室里讨论很久而不能解决的理论联系实际的问题得到解决了。
        向红透专深前进
    教学改革后大跃进的新局面，是整风运动发展的必然结果。目前，华东政法学院的全体师生正心情舒畅、干劲充沛地向红透专深的目标前进。
    通过教学改革的高潮，全院师生认清了当前的形势和自己应走的道路，都迫切地要求改造自己成为红透专深的工人阶级知识分子。在深入整改的同时，都自动地修订了个人规划，这就形成了比规划、比先进、自我改造的高潮。教师们总结了双反以来的收获，决心要把心交给党，交给人民。他们体会到不红就不能专，红不透也就专不深，因此自觉地要求彻底改变政治立场，在三年内锻炼自己成为政治上的左派。教授们表示“老当益壮，一定要与青年同志比一比干劲”。各教研组还自动地订立了爱国爱校爱生的三爱公约，同学们在修订规划的过程中，相互之间也开展了批评和检查，不少原来落后的同学，现在已转变成为先进人物了。他们还创造了订立“政治合同”的办法相互促进，共同提高。四年级同学在规划中保证100％地服从国家分配。目前，该院正在结合教学改革中揭露的主要问题，全面开展对资产阶级学术思想的批判，使教学改革进一步地向纵深发展。
