    Fujian is a Treasure Trove
    Over a Thousand Useful Wild Plants
    (Our Fuzhou dispatch, April 21st) The Fujian Province Commerce and Supply and Marketing departments have put forward the slogan "Go up the mountains to collect treasures, make a great leap forward in wild plants," planning to expand the collection of wild plants this year from more than 120 varieties last year to about 1,000 varieties. The total collection will reach more than 280 million jin, an increase of about seventeen times compared to last year. From this, they will process over 6 million jin of industrial oil, process 60 million to 90 million jin of man-made cotton, and use a portion of the wild plants to replace over 100 million jin of grain for winemaking.
    In order to realize this plan, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have dispatched cadres deep into the mountainous areas to investigate various wild plant resources. The Minhou County Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently organized two wild plant survey teams to investigate Xikeng, Weiqiao and other townships. With the help of local veteran farmers, they quickly discovered 111 new wild plants with high economic value, with a yield of more than 3,500 dan. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Ninghua, Changting, Shanghang, Yongding, Wuping, and Liancheng counties also discovered more than 400 new wild plants in preliminary investigations.
    Fujian Province has a mild climate and abundant rainfall, with a rich variety and yield of wild plants. According to preliminary estimates by relevant departments, there are about 1,000 or more kinds of wild plants with high economic value growing here. Among them, acorns alone, which contain a lot of starch and oil, have an annual output of about 280 million jin. If all of them are collected and utilized, about 28.8 million jin of industrial oil and more than 90 million jin of baijiu can be produced annually, and there are more than 100 million jin of distiller's grains that can be used for pig raising.

    福建是宝库
    有用的野生植物有一千多种
    本报福州21日电　福建省商业和供销部门提出“上山采宝，向野生植物大进军”的口号，计划今年采集野生植物由去年的一百二十多种扩大到一千种左右，采集总量达两亿八千多万斤，约比去年增加十七倍，从中加工工业用油六百多万斤，加工人造棉花六千万斤到九千万斤，并且用一部分野生植物代替一亿多斤粮食酿酒。
    为了实现这个规划，各地供销合作社已派干部深入山区调查各种野生植物资源。闽侯县供销社最近组织的两个野生植物普查队，到西坑、尾桥等乡调查，在当地老农帮助下，很快就发现了一百一十一种新的、经济价值很高的野生植物，产量达三千五百多担。宁化、长汀、上杭、永定、武平和连城等县供销社初步调查中，也发现四百多种新的野生植物。
    福建省气候温和，雨水充沛，野生植物的种类和产量都很丰富。据有关部门初步调查估算，这里生长各种经济价值很高的野生植物约在一千种以上，其中单是含淀粉和油量很高的橡子，年产量就达两亿八千万斤左右，如果全部采集利用起来，每年约可生产两千八百多万斤工业用油和九千多万斤白酒，还有一亿多斤酒糟可以用来养猪。　（刘葵华）
