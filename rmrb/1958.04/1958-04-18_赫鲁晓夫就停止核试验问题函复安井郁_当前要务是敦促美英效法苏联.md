Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev, in a letter to Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, stated that the main task now is to urge other countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons to follow the example of the Soviet Union. As long as these countries also cease testing nuclear weapons, it will be possible to create real possibilities for concluding an international agreement on the complete prohibition of the production, stockpiling, and use of such weapons.

The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs had sent a telegram to Khrushchev on the 1st, welcoming the Soviet Union's announcement of a unilateral cessation of nuclear weapon testing. Khrushchev's letter was a response to this telegram.

Khrushchev's letter continued: We can assure the Japanese people that the Soviet people and government will continue to make unremitting efforts to save mankind from the danger of nuclear war, to strive for peace and international security, to strive for peaceful coexistence among all countries, and to maintain the friendship between the Soviet and Japanese peoples.

Khrushchev wished the Council success in its struggle to mobilize the people to strive for the removal of foreign military bases on Japanese territory and to oppose dragging Japan into the whirlpool of arms expansion, to strive for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, to strive for strengthening the friendship between the Soviet Union and Japan, and to strive for universal peace.

Khrushchev finally stated that he hoped the Japanese people would spare no effort to strive for the noble goal of preventing the outbreak of rocket-nuclear war.

    赫鲁晓夫就停止核试验问题函复安井郁
    当前要务是敦促美英效法苏联
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在给日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁的信中说，现在的主要任务在于敦促其他拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家效法苏联。只要这些国家也停止试验核武器，就能够创造切实的可能性来缔结关于完全禁止生产、储存和使用这种武器的国际协定。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会曾经在1日致电赫鲁晓夫，对苏联宣布单方面停止试验核武器的决议表示欢迎。赫鲁晓夫的信就是对这封电报的答复。
    赫鲁晓夫的信接着说，我们可以向日本人民保证，苏联人民和政府今后仍将进行不懈的努力，来争取使人类免于核战争的危险，争取和平和国际安全，争取各国和平共处，保持苏日两国人民的友谊。
    赫鲁晓夫祝协议会在动员人民起来争取撤除日本领土上的外国军事基地和反对把日本卷进扩充军备的漩涡、争取禁止原子武器和氢武器、争取加强苏日两国的友谊、争取普遍和平而进行的斗争中获得成就。
    赫鲁晓夫最后表示，他希望日本人民不遗余力地为达到防止火箭——核战争的爆发这个崇高目的而奋斗。
