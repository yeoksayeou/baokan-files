Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 10th: Soviet Communist Party Central Committee First Secretary and Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev said today at a mass rally in Moscow that the Soviet Union still has hope for the difficult disarmament issue. However, it should be said to those gentlemen who oppose eliminating the "Cold War": we have been patient enough. It is impossible to negotiate with us by relying on pressure and threats.

Khrushchev made these remarks at a mass rally held at the Lenin Stadium Sports Palace to welcome the Soviet Communist Party and government delegation back from Hungary this afternoon.

Khrushchev told the 15,000 listeners attending the rally that the Soviet Union had taken many constructive steps in the struggle to ease international tensions, but for the time being, it cannot be hoped that there will be any results. Because the other side is always playing tricks, creating more and more new obstacles on the road to solving the disarmament problem.

After the Soviet Union made the decision to unilaterally stop nuclear weapons tests, it called on the United States and Britain to follow the Soviet Union's example. But someone told us: supervision is needed. Okay, we agreed to establish supervision, but the answer we got was still: no, something else is needed. The problem here is very simple: Western countries are unwilling to reach an agreement, so they are desperately putting forward conditions that cannot be implemented.

Khrushchev said that American monopoly capitalists think they are omnipotent. Everyone must tremble before them. They issue orders to many capitalist countries and want to issue orders to the whole world. Only the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist camp countries have not kowtowed to them, but are implementing an independent and peaceful policy.

Khrushchev said that some people suggested supervising us, and we are in favor of supervision, but the supervision they advocate is interfering in the internal affairs of our countries and undermining our sovereignty. In short, if you want them to sit down at the table, they insist on putting their feet on the table. We advocate establishing supervision, but we want to say, please do not fly to places where you should not fly. In India, there is the sacred tomb of Gandhi. If you want to see this tomb, you should respect Indian traditions—take off your shoes and approach the tomb barefoot. We have been there and respect this tradition. Therefore, gentlemen, you should not only cherish your dollar pockets, but also respect the traditions of other people. You should know that they also have their own self-esteem and their own interests, and they want to protect their own security.

The ruling groups in Western countries say: let us reach an agreement, our planes can fly over your countries, and yours can fly over ours. But we don't want to fly over your countries. We don't want your spirits to be concentrated over our countries either.

Khrushchev continued, we should adopt all feasible methods to defend peace. However, we cannot allow people to intimidate us. The ruling groups in Western countries want to use various methods to torment us. They believe that if the Soviet Union proposes disarmament, then this naturally shows that it has reached a dead end. You have been waiting for this situation for forty years. However, now there is no such situation, and there never will be. You will never wait for such a situation: wanting to make us helpless in front of you and surrender to you. This is impossible. We hope to negotiate on equal terms, respecting our dignity, and based on our economic and moral factors. Only under these conditions can we negotiate with you.

If the ruling groups in Western countries continue to insist on obstructing peaceful consultation on international issues in the future, then the people of all countries will demand an end to the "Cold War" and a stop to the arms race.

Khrushchev pointed out that in the struggle against class enemies, we do not need to fight each other. In this struggle, we have another weapon, which is to prosper the national economy, improve the material welfare of the working people, and increase the production of consumer goods. He said that now we estimate, and can also say, that in a not-too-long time, we will be able to reach the peak of production in capitalist countries, and we will exceed the production level of the United States. American gentlemen, the day when you yourselves believe in the superiority of the Soviet system is coming.

In his speech, Khrushchev also talked about the results of the Soviet party and government delegation's visit to Hungary and the domestic situation in Hungary. He said that the results of the Soviet party and government delegation's visit to Hungary were very satisfactory. The meeting between the delegation and the Hungarian working people showed the unbreakable friendship between the Hungarian and Soviet people. He said that all efforts must be made to continue to strengthen the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Hungarian people.

Regarding the domestic situation in Hungary, Khrushchev said that the situation in Hungary is very good now. Hungary has made significant achievements in socialist construction. The consequences of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in all aspects of Hungarian life have been eliminated. The Hungarian working people are united around the Socialist Workers' Party, and the party's prestige has been infinitely improved.

Naturally, People's Hungary needs help. We, the Soviet Union, should not only continue to support Hungary, but also support all fraternal socialist countries so that our camp will always be strong. Then our common cause will be more consolidated.

Khrushchev spoke with particular enthusiasm about the Hungarian leaders Kadar and Münnich, pointing out that they are true revolutionaries who are loyal to the cause of the working class and contribute all their strength to the struggle to build socialism.

### 赫鲁晓夫说靠威胁是不行的  西方国家应该坐下来谈判

    赫鲁晓夫说靠威胁是不行的
    西方国家应该坐下来谈判
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫今天在莫斯科的一个群众集会上讲话时说，苏联对困难的裁军问题仍然抱着希望。可是，应该对那些反对消除“冷战”的先生们说：我们已经忍耐得够了，要想依靠压力和威胁来同我们谈判是不行的。
    赫鲁晓夫在今天下午率领苏联共产党和政府代表团由匈牙利回到莫斯科。他是在列宁运动场体育宫举行的欢迎代表团的群众大会上讲这些话的。
    赫鲁晓夫对参加大会的一万五千名听众说，苏联在争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中采取了很多建设性的步骤，但是暂时还不能希望有什么结果。因为，对方总是耍花招，在解决裁军问题的道路上制造越来越多的新障碍。
    苏联在采取了单方面停止核武器试验的决定以后，曾经呼吁美国和英国仿效苏联的榜样。但是有人向我们说：需要监督。好吧，我们同意建立监督，可是答复我们的还是：不行，还需要什么东西。这里问题很简单：西方国家不愿意达成协议，因此拚命提出那些不可能执行的条件。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国垄断资本家以为他们是无所不能的。在他们面前谁都要发抖。他们对许多资本主义国家发号施令，并且要对全世界发号施令。只有苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义阵营的国家没有对他们卑躬屈膝，而实行着独立的和平政策。
    赫鲁晓夫说，有人建议对我们进行监督，我们赞成监督，但是他们主张的监督是干涉我们这些国家的内政，破坏我们的主权。总而言之，你要叫他们在桌边坐下来，他们偏要把脚放在桌子上。我们主张建立监督，但是我们要说，请不要飞到不应该飞去的地方。印度有一座神圣的甘地的坟墓，如果你想去看看这个坟墓，你就应当尊重印度的传统——脱了鞋赤足走近坟墓。我们曾经到过那里，而且尊重这个传统。因此，先生们，你们不要只是爱惜自己的美元口袋，而且也要尊重别国人民的传统，你们要知道，他们也有自己的自尊心和自己的利益，他们要保护自己的安全。
    西方国家的统治集团说：让我们达成协议，我们的飞机可以飞到你们国家的上空，而你们的也可以飞到我们的上空。但是我们不希望飞到你们国家的上空去，我们希望你们的精神也不要集中在我们国家的上空。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们应该采用一切可行的办法来保卫和平。但是，我们不能让人来恫吓我们。西方国家的统治集团想利用各种方法来折磨我们。他们认为：如果苏联建议裁军，那么，这自然说明它已经无路可走。四十年来，你们一直在等待这种局面，然而，现在没有将来也永远不会有这种局面的。你们永远也等不到这样的局面：想使我们在你们面前束手无策，并向你们投降。这是不可能的，我们希望在平等条件、尊重自己的尊严和根据我们的经济和道德因素的基础上来进行谈判。只有在这种条件下我们才能同你们谈判。
    西方国家统治集团今后如果继续坚持阻碍和平协商国际问题的话，那末，各国人民反正会要求结束“冷战”和停止军备竞赛的。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在反对阶级敌人的斗争中，我们用不着厮杀，在这场斗争中我们有另一种武器，这就是繁荣国民经济，增进劳动人民的物质福利，增加消费品的生产。他说，现在我们估计而且也可以说，再过不长的时间，我们就可以达到资本主义国家生产的最高峰，我们将超过美国的生产水平。美国先生们，你们自己相信苏维埃制度优越性的日子就要到来了。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中还谈到了苏联党政代表团访问匈牙利的结果和匈牙利的国内情况。他说，苏联党政代表团访问匈牙利的结果非常令人满意。代表团同匈牙利劳动人民的会见显示了匈苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊。他说，必须尽一切力量来继续加强苏匈两国人民的友谊和合作。
    关于匈牙利国内的情况，赫鲁晓夫说，匈牙利现在的情况很好。匈牙利在社会主义建设方面取得了重大的成就。反革命叛乱在匈牙利生活的各个方面所造成的后果已经消除了。匈牙利劳动人民团结在社会主义工人党的周围，党的威信无限地提高了。
    自然，人民匈牙利需要帮助。我们苏联不仅应当继续支持匈牙利，而且应当支持一切兄弟的社会主义国家，使我们的阵营始终强大。那时我们的共同事业将更加巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫特别热情地谈到了匈牙利领导人卡达尔、明尼赫等，他指出，他们是真正的革命家，他们忠于工人阶级事业，贡献一切力量，为建成社会主义而奋斗。
