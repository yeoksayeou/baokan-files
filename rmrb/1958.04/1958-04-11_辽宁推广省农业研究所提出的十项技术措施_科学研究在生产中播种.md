Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 10th April. The Liaoning Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute has proposed ten technical measures for increasing agricultural production in Liaoning Province. These technical measures have been adopted by the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture and are being promoted and applied in agricultural technology reform.

These measures are the results of scientific research conducted by the institute targeting agricultural production in Liaoning Province, including soybean topping to inhibit excessive growth and lodging, early rice cultivation to increase rice yields, corn hybridization, potato seed retention to prevent degeneration, early spring irrigation or winter irrigation to alleviate water shortages during the rice seedling stage, utilization of natural fertilizer peat, prevention of sorghum head smut, natural agricultural economic zoning, strengthening demonstration breeding farms, and weed control in paddy fields to increase rice yields.

The soybean topping technique to inhibit excessive growth and lodging was proposed by the Jinzhou Experimental Station of this institute based on summarizing the production experience of the masses, after five years of research and experimentation. In recent years, the effect of key trials in various places has been very good. For example, in a comparative test in the Qianjin Commune of Xiuyan County, the yield of topped soybeans was 13.4% higher than that of untopped soybeans; in a comparison in the Dawa Commune of Changtu County, the yield increased by 20%; in the Wanfeng Commune of Jinxi County, topping was fully implemented on 7,000 hectares of corn intercropped with soybeans, which increased by 66% compared with the local untopped intercropped soybeans. Liaoning Province has about 700,000 hectares of soybeans. If 150,000 hectares can be topped, the average yield can be increased by 10%, that is, the province can increase the production of more than 20 million kilograms of soybeans. Corn hybridization is the main technical measure to increase corn production. The Fengcheng Experimental Station of this institute has selected four excellent hybrid varieties, including "Fengza No. 1," "Fengza No. 5," "5401," and "5402." After several years of production trials and regional trials, it has been proved that hybrid varieties increase yields by 15% to 30% compared with local improved varieties. Early rice cultivation techniques can overcome the difficulties of cold weather and short frost-free periods in the north, which prevent rice from fully developing and growing. This technical measure can break through the limitations of natural conditions and increase rice production. The peat utilization technique can expand fertilizer sources and increase crop yields; because peatlands are mostly swampy wasteland, mining peat can also expand cultivated land area or increase ponds. In the past, general old data considered that Liaoning Province did not contain peat, but after the investigation by the peat survey team jointly formed by the Liaoning Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural College, and Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture, it has been initially discovered that 27 counties contain peat. Most of these underground-stored peats are well-rotted low-position peats, which are very suitable for use as agricultural fertilizers.

    辽宁推广省农业研究所提出的十项技术措施
    科学研究在生产中播种
    新华社沈阳10日电　辽宁省农业科学研究所为辽宁省的农业增产提出了十项技术措施。这些技术措施已被辽宁省农业厅采纳，并在农业技术改革中推广应用。
    这些措施是这个研究所针对辽宁省的农业生产进行科学研究的成果，其中包括大豆摘心抑制陡长倒伏、水稻早期栽培提高稻谷产量、玉米杂交、马铃薯留种防止退化、早春灌溉或冬灌以缓和水稻苗期水源不足、自然肥料草炭利用、防止高粱黑穗病、自然农业经济区划、加强示范繁殖农场、稻田防除杂草提高稻谷产量等各个方面的技术措施。
    大豆摘心抑制陡长倒伏的技术措施是这个研究所锦州试验站在总结群众生产经验的基础上，经过五年的研究试验提出的。近年来在各地重点试行的效果很好。如在岫岩县前进社对比试验结果，摘心的比不摘心的增产13.4％；在昌图县大洼社对比结果，增产20％；在锦西县万锋社七千公顷苞米混作大豆地上全部实行摘心，比当地未摘心的混作大豆增产66％。辽宁省约有七十万公顷大豆，如能摘心十五万公顷，平均可增产10％，即全省可增产两千万公斤以上的大豆。玉米杂交是使玉米增产的主要技术措施。这个研究所凤城试验站已选出“凤杂一号”、“凤杂五号”、“五四零一”、“五四零二”等四个优良杂交种，经过几年来的生产试验和区域试验，证明杂交种比当地良种增产15％到30％。水稻早期栽培技术措施可以克服北方天气寒冷，无霜期短，水稻不能充分发育成长的困难。这种技术措施可以突破自然条件的限制，使水稻增产。草炭利用技术措施可以扩大肥料来源，使农作物增产；因草炭地多为沼泽荒地，开采草炭又可扩大耕地面积或增辟水塘。过去一般旧资料认为辽宁省不蕴藏草炭，但经过辽宁省农业科学研究所、沈阳农学院、辽宁省农业厅共同组成草炭调查队的调查，已初步发现二十七个县蕴藏有草炭。这些地下贮存的草炭大多数是腐熟较好的低位草炭，极适于作农业肥料。
