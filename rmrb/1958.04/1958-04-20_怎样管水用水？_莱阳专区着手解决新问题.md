How to Manage and Use Water?
Laiyang Prefecture Begins to Solve New Problems

(Our dispatch) According to the Dazhong Daily: How to manage and use water, so that water conservancy construction can fully play its role? This is a new problem that Laiyang Prefecture, Shandong Province, is solving.

Most of the newly built water conservancy projects in Laiyang Prefecture have played a role, but from the perspective of water use, there are still some problems that urgently need to be solved. These problems are: (1) Some areas lack an overall concept in water use, only caring about their own use, regardless of others. In some rivers in Wendeng County, the upstream stores water but cannot use it, while the downstream has no water to use; the water in the Xiangshui Ditch Reservoir of the Yetou Township Xiangshui Commune in Laiyang County cannot be used and flows out, while the neighboring Lugezhuang Commune urgently needs water but has no water. (2) There is still a lack of comprehensive and unified planning for water use. Chengguan Town in Laiyang County plans to plant 5,000 mu of rice this year, and built a dam at the Xianhe Sluice, but the Siyuantou Commune not far upstream also built a dam, which has caused difficulties in water use for Chengguan Town. This also reflects the ideological problems of individual technical designers, who only care about the affairs of the commune they are in, and lack an overall perspective in design. (3) There is serious waste of water. Some people use hundreds of cubic meters of water to irrigate one mu of land, thinking that the more the better, without knowing how to save water; others lose more than 50% of water due to unlevelled land, poorly built canals, or leaking canals. (4) Some cadres and masses still have the idea of ​​emphasizing construction and neglecting management, which reduces the efficiency of water conservancy projects due to poor management. (5) There is a lack of water lifting tools. Some reservoirs have water but cannot lift it, and some wells have no water wheels.

In order to solve these problems, Laiyang Prefecture has decided to first establish a socialist ideology and an overall concept among the broad masses of cadres and people, and to educate and criticize the localist thinking of "water not leaving the township, water not leaving the commune." Secondly, it is necessary to implement the principle of comprehensive planning and rational allocation, and to conduct a comprehensive plan for how many projects, how many water sources, how much water can be stored, and how much land can be irrigated in a township, a commune, and a team, and the upper, middle, and lower reaches of each river must be comprehensively and rationally allocated according to the principles of benefiting increased production and unity. Thirdly, while vigorously developing water sources, it is necessary to attach importance to the management of water. Fourthly, it is necessary to regularly carry out technical education on water use and management, and to launch a mass movement to improve water lifting tools.

    怎样管水用水？
    莱阳专区着手解决新问题
    本报讯　据大众日报消息：如何管水用水，使水利建设充分发挥作用？这是山东省莱阳专区正在解决的新问题。
    莱阳全区新建水利工程大都发挥了作用，但从用水的过程中看，也仍存在一些问题，迫切需要解决。这些问题是：（一）部分地区在用水中缺乏整体观念，只管自己用，不管别人。文登县有的河流上游蓄水用不了，而下游没水用；莱阳县野头乡香水沟社水库的水用不了往外流，而邻近的鲁格庄社急需用水却没水。（二）用水中还缺乏全面统一规划。莱阳县城关镇今年计划种五千亩水稻，在蚬河闸了一条拦水坝，但在上游不远的寺院头社也闸了一条坝，这就使城关镇用水发生了困难。这也反映了个别技术设计人员的思想问题，他们在那个社就只管一个社的事，设计时缺乏全局观念。（三）用水有严重浪费现象。有的一亩地浇一遍水即用水上百公方，认为越多越好，不知节约用水；有的是因土地没整平，渠道没有修好或渠道漏水，即损失水50％以上。（四）部分干部和群众还存在重修轻管理的思想，这样就使水利工程因管理不好降低利用效率。（五）缺乏提水工具。有些水库有水提不上来，有的水井没水车。
    为了解决这些问题，莱阳专区决定首先要在广大干部群众中，树立起社会主义思想和整体观念，对于“水不出乡、水不出社”的本位主义思想，要进行教育和批判。其次，要贯彻全面规划合理分配的原则，要把一个乡、一个社、一个队，有多少工程、多少水源、能蓄多少水、浇多少地，进行一次全面规划，每一条河流的上中下游用水，都要根据有利增产和团结的原则，进行全面合理分配。第三，在大力开发水源同时，必须重视对水的管理。第四，要经常进行用水管水等技术教育，并开展群众性改进提水工具运动。
