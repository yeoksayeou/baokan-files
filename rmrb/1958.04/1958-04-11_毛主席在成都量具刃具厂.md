Chairman Mao at the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory

More than a month after Chairman Mao visited the Chengdu Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory on March 5th, the people in the factory are still very excited when they talk about seeing Chairman Mao, their faces glowing with happiness.

Party Secretary Liu Ju said: Since Chairman Mao's visit, the enthusiasm of all the workers in the factory has soared, and 110,000 big-character posters have been put up. The March leap forward plan was completed four and a half days ahead of schedule. Now the workers are creating new achievements to respond to Chairman Mao's infinite care for everyone.

The scene of Chairman Mao's inspection of the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory was like this: That day, the weather was clear, and the sun was shining. A little after four o'clock in the afternoon, two cars drove through the green fields and arrived at the Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Factory, stopping at the preparation workshop.

Workshop Director Wang Deming had just finished writing a work report in the office when he heard that Chairman Mao had arrived. He couldn't believe it and rushed to the workshop door. Chairman Mao was stepping out of the car, and Wang Deming immediately greeted him and shook his hand.

Chairman Mao, wearing a silver-gray suit, asked Wang Deming with a smile, "Are you the workshop director?"

"Yes, I am!"

Chairman Mao pointed to the blacksmith who was working through the glass window and asked Wang Deming, "Can you do this?"

"No, I am a lathe operator." Wang Deming said, making a gesture.

Chairman Mao asked again, "Where are you from?" Where should he begin to recount the decades of pain in the old society! The workshop director, who had been a lathe operator for more than 20 years, could only briefly introduce his background, feeling warm in his heart.

Wang Deming, who was a bit restrained at first, felt lighthearted when he saw how kind and amiable Chairman Mao was.

Chairman Mao pointed to the workshop and said, "May I take a look at your workshop?" These humble and friendly words moved Wang Deming so much that he couldn't speak, only nodding with a smile.

Blacksmith Xie Qinrong was operating a 150-kilogram air hammer, striking the red-hot forgings with each rise and fall, sparks flying everywhere like strings of firecrackers exploding. Chairman Mao stopped to watch Xie Qinrong work, watching very carefully. Wang Deming introduced by his side: This machine tool was made in Shenyang, that one was made in Taiyuan, most of them are domestic products, and the efficiency is very high. Chairman Mao listened and smiled.

Seeing Chairman Mao's arrival, the workers in the workshop worked even harder on the lathes. Laughter and applause resounded in all directions. Chairman Mao walked very slowly, asking questions about this and that, caring about everything. In the material warehouse, Chairman Mao touched a roll of steel strip and asked what it was used for. Wang Deming replied: The steel strip is used to make dial indicators for measuring tools. Walking to an inspection table, there were many newly made parts on it. Chairman Mao picked up one and asked, "Is this a ruler?" Wang Deming said, "It is a ruler, also called a caliper." Chairman Mao also asked about many parts and inquired about the effectiveness of various inspection instruments, paying special attention to the precision of measuring tools and cutting tools. This thorough and meticulous style moved everyone present.

The workers gradually gathered around. A young worker walked past the cutting machine and squeezed to Chairman Mao's side. Chairman Mao talked to him kindly.

"What's your name?"

"My name is Wu Chaowu."

"How old are you?"

"Nineteen years old." Wu Chaowu wanted to shake hands with Chairman Mao so much! Seeing his hands full of oil stains, he hesitated. Chairman Mao seemed to see through his heart and extended his hand first. Wu Chaowu grasped it tightly, jumping up with joy, his face full of happy smiles. Chairman Mao's love for the younger generation moved him and everyone.

It was not until Chairman Mao finished inspecting the preparation workshop and walked to the milling cutter workshop that the factory Party Secretary and the factory director heard the news and rushed over. Chairman Mao was afraid of affecting their work, so he did not notify them and went to the workshop first. Chairman Mao asked for their names, shook hands with them one by one, and then went to other workshops.

At exactly five o'clock, the workers changed shifts, and many people got off work. People ran around telling each other: "Chairman Mao is here!" The news spread throughout the factory, and groups of workers surged towards the reamer workshop. Someone shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and immediately formed a chorus of "Long live!"

At this time, Chairman Mao kept waving to everyone, often shaking the workers' greasy hands. Arriving at the machine repair workshop, Chairman Mao watched the blackboard newspaper, reading the workers' leap forward pledges one by one. When he read a pledge to achieve civilized production, Chairman Mao was very interested and said with a smile: "This is very good!"

More and more workers who had finished work gathered, and the sound of cheers of "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" shook the heavens and the earth. When Chairman Mao waved goodbye to the jubilant people and was about to get in the car to leave the factory, there were still countless workers rushing to shake hands with Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao left. Boundless warmth and happiness remained in people's hearts forever. Chairman Mao cares about the major affairs of the country, and in his busy schedule, he came to the factory, caring about the workers and production so much, bringing the greatest encouragement to the factory's more than 3,000 workers. That day, the excited workers could not calm down for a long time, talking about Chairman Mao's visit to the factory all night long. Old worker Luo Jianqun later said: "As soon as I close my eyes, the great image of Chairman Mao appears before me." Young foreman Liang Wenxue and many workers said: "This hand that shook hands with Chairman Mao can no longer do anything to betray the people."

The next day, a new high tide of double anti- campaigns was set off in the factory. Big-character posters filled the factory, and both thought and production were making great leaps forward. Since then, good news about improving tools, innovating technology, breaking quotas, and creating new records has been constantly appearing in the factory. Li Shubo completed ten days' worth of tasks in one day. Lathe operator Tian Jingqi did eighteen days of work in one day. Someone improved work efficiency thirty times, and some even improved it forty times.

Everyone is responding to Chairman Mao's care with practical actions. By the end of March, 24% of the factory's employees had improved their work efficiency by more than one time, and their names were on the leap forward list. Almost every machine tool in the tool workshop was completing five days' worth of tasks in one day, and leap forward red flags were inserted. Now, the workers of this factory are leaping forward again and again. Many workers say: I guarantee that I will never lag behind, and I will report good news to our beloved Chairman Mao every month with new production achievements.

    毛主席在成都量具刃具厂
    毛主席于3月5日到过成都量具刃具厂。一个多月以后的今天，厂里的人谈起见到毛主席的时候，情绪还是十分激动，脸上闪着幸福的光彩。
    党委书记刘炬说：自毛主席来过后，全厂职工干劲冲天，大字报贴了十一万张。3月份跃进计划提前四天半完成。现在职工们都以创造新成绩，来回答毛主席对大家的无限关怀。
    毛主席到量具刃具厂视察的情景是这样的：那一天，天气晴朗，风和日丽。下午四点多，两辆小汽车驶过绿色田野，开到了量具刃具厂，在备料车间停下来。
    车间主任王德明在办公室刚写完工作报告，听说毛主席来了，还不相信，连忙奔到车间门口。毛主席正跨步下车，王德明立刻迎上前去。毛主席和他握了手。
    毛主席穿银灰色衣服，含笑问王德明：“你是车间主任吗？”
    “是的！”
    毛主席隔着玻璃窗指着正在操作的锻工，问王德明：“你会干这个吗？”
    “不会。我是车工。”王德明说着，还比了手势。
    毛主席又问道：“你是从哪里来的？”旧社会几十年的痛苦经历，从哪里说起呢！这个干过二十几年车工的车间主任，只得简单介绍了自己的身世，心里感到热呼呼的。
    原来还有点拘束的王德明，看到毛主席这样亲切、慈祥，顿时轻快起来了。
    毛主席指着车间说：“我看看你们的车间，可以吗？”这句谦虚和气的话，使王德明感动得说不出话，只是笑着点头。
  锻工谢钦荣在操作一百五十公斤重的空气锤，一起一落，锤打着火红的锻件，火星四飞，像串串喜炮在爆炸。毛主席停下来看谢钦荣干活，看得很仔细。王德明在旁边介绍说：这台机床沈阳造，那台太原造，大都是国产品，效率很高。毛主席边听边微笑。
    看到毛主席来了，车间工人在车床上干劲更大。欢笑和掌声响遍四方。毛主席走得很慢，问这问那，对什么都关心。在材料库，毛主席用手摸了摸一盘带钢，问这是作什么用的。王德明回答：带钢是作量具千分表用的材料。走到一个检查台前，上面放了许多新做出的配件。毛主席拿了一件问：“这是量尺吗？”王德明说：“是量尺，也叫卡尺。”毛主席还问了许多配件，又探询了各种检查器的效能，对量具刃具的精密程度特别注意。这种深入细致的作风，感动着在场的所有的人。
    工人们渐渐围上来。有个青工走过切料机，挤到毛主席身边。毛主席和他亲切地谈了话。
    “你叫什么名字？”
    “我叫吴朝武。”
    “有多大年纪？”
    “十九岁了。”吴朝武多想和毛主席握手啊！一看自己满手油污，又迟疑。毛主席像看透他的心，先伸出了手。吴朝武紧紧握住，高兴得跳起来，脸上堆满欢乐的笑。毛主席对青年一代的热爱，激动着他和大家。
    直到毛主席视察完了备料车间，走到铣刀车间的时候，厂党委书记和厂长才闻讯赶到。毛主席原来怕影响他们工作，没有通知他们，就先下了车间。毛主席问了姓名，一一握手，又到了别的车间。
    五点正，工人交接班，许多人下了班。人们奔走相告：“毛主席来了！”消息飞传全厂，一群一群的工人涌向铰刀车间。不知是谁先喊了声“毛主席万岁！”马上就形成了一片“万岁”的欢呼声。
    这时，毛主席不断向大家挥手致意，时时握住工人油腻的手。来到机修车间，毛主席观看黑板报，一条一条读着工人写的跃进保证书。读到一条要做到文明生产时，毛主席很感兴趣，笑着说：“这很好！”
    下了班的工人越聚越多，欢呼“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的声音振动天地。当毛主席向欢腾的人们挥手告别，要登车离厂时，还有数不清的工人赶来同毛主席握手。
    毛主席走了。无比的温暖和幸福，永远留在人们心上。毛主席操心全国大事，在百忙之中来到工厂，对职工和生产是这样关怀，给全厂三千多职工带来了最大的鼓舞。这天，激动的工人，老也平息不下来，彻夜谈着毛主席来厂的事。老工人罗建群后来说：“我一闭上眼睛，面前就出现毛主席的伟大形象。”青年工长梁文学和许多工人都说：“我们这只手和毛主席握过，这只手再也不能作对不起人民的事。”
    第二天，厂里掀起了双反的新高潮。大字报满厂皆是，思想和生产都在大跃进。从这以后，改进工具、革新技术、突破定额、创造新纪录的喜讯不断地在全厂出现。李树波一天完成十天任务。车工田景琦一天干了十八天的活。有人提高工作效率三十倍，还有人提高四十几倍。
    大家都在用实际行动回答毛主席的关怀。到3月底，全厂有24％的职工提高工作效率一倍以上，名字上了跃进榜。工具车间几乎每台机床都是一天完成五天任务，插上了跃进红旗。现在，这个厂的职工正在跃进再跃进。许多工人说：我保证永不掉队，月月以新的生产成就向亲爱的毛主席报捷。
