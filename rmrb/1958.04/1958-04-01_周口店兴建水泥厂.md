    Cement Plant Being Built in Zhoukoudian
    On March 20th, Team 118 of the Tianjin Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau came to the vicinity of Zhoukoudian, the home of Peking Man, to survey coalfields. By March 27th, after reaching a depth of sixty meters, they discovered sandstone and shale. The drilling team members were very excited, believing that there must be coal here, and that the coal seam would not be too thin. Now they are continuing to drill with full confidence.

    周口店兴建水泥厂
    3月20日，天津煤田地质勘探局一一八队来到北京猿人的故乡——周口店附近勘察煤田。到3月27日进至六十公尺深处就发现了砂岩和液岩，钻探队员们十分振奋，他们认为这里一定有煤，而且煤层不会太薄。现在他们正信心百倍地继续钻进。
