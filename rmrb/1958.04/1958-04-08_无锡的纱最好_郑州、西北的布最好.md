    Wuxi's Yarn is the Best
    Zhengzhou and the Northwest's Fabric is the Best
    Xinhua News Agency reported: The Ministry of Textile Industry recently held a national cotton textile production Great Leap Forward meeting in Qingdao. After inspecting yarn and fabric samples and holding thorough discussions, they selected the best quality yarn with the most even count and cotton fabric with the fewest defects. The results of the evaluation showed that the yarn quality was best in the Jiangsu region, with Wuxi winning first place in three of the four yarn count evaluations. The fabric quality was best in Zhengzhou and the Northwest region. The results of the evaluation shattered the superstition that "only large state-owned factories can produce good yarn and fabric," giving some arrogant large state-owned factories a blow to the head. Therefore, a wave of learning from Wuxi, Zhengzhou, and the Northwest, and catching up with Wuxi, Zhengzhou, and the Northwest, was set off at the meeting. Representatives from Shanghai and Qingdao are preparing to visit Wuxi to learn from them.

    无锡的纱最好
    郑州、西北的布最好
    纺织工业部最近在青岛召开的全国棉纺织生产大跃进会议，经过检验纱布样品和进行了充分讨论，评选了各支条干优级纱和疵点最微少的棉布。评比的结果，纱的质量以江苏地区为最好，其中无锡分别在四种支数纱的评比中，获得三个第一；布的质量以郑州和西北地区为最好。评比的结果，打破了“只有国营大厂才能生产好纱好布”的迷信，给予某些国营大厂的骄气当头一棒。因此会上掀起了一个学无锡、郑州、西北和赶无锡、郑州、西北的热潮。上海代表和青岛代表都准备前往无锡参观学习。　　（据新华社讯）
