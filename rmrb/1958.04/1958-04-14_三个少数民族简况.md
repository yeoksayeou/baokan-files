Brief introduction of three minority nationalities:

    The Ewenki Nationality
    The Ewenki nationality is one of the smaller minority nationalities in China, with a total population of over 10,000 nationwide. Among them, about 7,000 reside in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (almost all concentrated in the Hulunbuir League), with the remainder distributed in Heilongjiang Province. For more than 300 years, this minority nationality has been divided into three different names: "Solun," "Tungus," and "Yakut." However, they have always called themselves Ewenki people. At the end of 1957, according to the wishes and actual circumstances of the people of this ethnic group, they were uniformly called the Ewenki nationality.
    In the past, the Ewenki nationality was known for its skills in riding and archery. During the Qing Dynasty and the Japanese puppet regime, the ruling class forcibly conscripted soldiers from among them, as well as the Daur and Oroqen nationalities, and implemented a high tax system. This greatly affected their economic life and reduced their population.
    The Ewenki nationality mainly engages in animal husbandry, with some people also engaged in agriculture or hunting. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government put forward the slogan of "prosperity for both people and livestock" among the Ewenki nationality. With the vigorous help of the Party and the efforts of the people of this nationality, a prosperous atmosphere has emerged here. In 1954, the livestock in Solun Banner had grown to more than 132,700 head, an increase of nearly four times compared with the time of the Japanese surrender. The Hailar Milk Chemical Plant has established a milk processing workshop here. Herders and farmers have enthusiastically participated in production cooperatives, and their lives have been greatly improved compared with before liberation. The population decline was fundamentally reversed in 1952.
    The language of the Ewenki nationality belongs to the Tungusic branch of the Altaic language family. Some older Ewenki people can speak Russian in addition to their own language, and there are some Russian words mixed in the Ewenki language. The Ewenki nationality has a domestic animal called "sibuxiang" (reindeer). They mainly believe in shamanism.
    The Daur Nationality
    China's Daur nationality has a population of about 50,000, distributed in three regions: Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang. The distribution pattern is characterized by large dispersion and small clusters. As early as more than 300 years ago, the Daur people who settled along the Nenjiang River engaged in various productions such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and hunting.
    Before liberation, most of the land of the Daur people was concentrated in the hands of landlords and rich peasants. The feudal exploitation seriously hindered the development of agricultural production. National oppression, feudal exploitation, and the invasion of Japanese imperialism left the economy and culture of the Daur nationality in a backward state, and the Daur working people lived in extreme poverty.
    After liberation, the land system was reformed in the areas where the Daur nationality lived, and production has greatly developed. Now, the Daur farmers have basically realized the semi-socialist nature of agricultural cooperativization, and many cooperatives have transitioned to advanced agricultural production cooperatives of a socialist nature.
    In recent years, the state has provided them with more than 200,000 yuan in loans, greatly supporting the agricultural production of the Daur people in mountainous areas. In addition, two supply and marketing cooperatives, six purchase and sales stations, seven credit cooperatives, and two veterinary stations have been established in the Daur-populated areas.
    The Daur nationality practices a monogamous marriage system. They believe in shamanism, worship multiple gods, and some people also believe in Lamaism.
    The Oroqen Nationality
    The Oroqen nationality is one of the smaller minority nationalities in China, distributed in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains forest areas bordering the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the northern part of Heilongjiang Province. There are a total of more than 2,200 people, of whom 1,200 live in the Heihe Special Zone of Heilongjiang Province, and more than 900 live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    The basic social organization of the Oroqen has more obvious remnants of clans or tribes, and they generally maintain the habit of democratically deciding on issues within the organization. This nationality is good at shooting and mainly lives by hunting. Some people also engage in agriculture, and some have become forestry workers.
    In the past few years since liberation, the Oroqen nationality has made great progress in politics, economy, and culture. In October 1951, the Oroqen Autonomous Banner was established. Around October 1957, the autonomous banner basically realized the settlement of all hunters in the banner. The distribution principle of "each according to his ability, distribution according to his work" has replaced the principle of "common labor, equal distribution." In the past, the Oroqen people had extremely poor cultural and sanitary conditions. Almost the entire nationality was illiterate, and only a few individuals knew some Manchu. Now, the autonomous banner has two primary schools with 214 students. (Attached picture)

    三个少数民族简况
    鄂温克族
    鄂温克民族是我国少数民族中人口较少的民族之一，在全国总计有一万多人，其中约七千多人居住在内蒙古自治区（几乎都集中在呼伦贝尔盟），其余分布在黑龙江省。三百多年来，这个少数民族一直被分为：“索伦”、“通古斯”和“雅库特”三个不同的称呼，但是，他们一向都称自己为鄂温克人。1957年底，根据该族人民的意愿和实际情况，统一称为鄂温克族。
    过去鄂温克族以善于骑射闻名。清代和日伪时期，统治阶级曾在他们和达呼尔族、鄂伦春族中强迫征兵，并实行高税制。使他们的经济生活受到很大的影响，人口也减少了。
    鄂温克族主要从事畜牧业，部分人兼营农业或狩猎。解放以后，党和人民政府在鄂温克族中提出了“人畜两旺”的口号，在党的大力帮助和本民族人民的努力下，这里已经出现了繁荣的气象。1954年，索伦旗的牲畜已发展到十三万二千七百多头，比日寇投降时增加了将近四倍。海拉尔牛奶化工厂在这里建立了牛奶加工车间。牧、农民们都踊跃参加了生产合作社，生活也比解放前大大提高了，人口下降的情况在1952年已经根本扭转过来了。
    鄂温克族的语言属于阿尔泰语系通古斯语族。部分年老的鄂温克人除了会说本民族语言外，还会说俄语，鄂温克语中也夹杂有一些俄语词汇。鄂温克族有一种家畜叫做“四不像”（驯鹿）。他们主要信仰萨满教。
    达呼尔族
    我国达呼尔民族约有五万人，分布在内蒙古、黑龙江和新疆三个地区，居住的情况是大分散、小聚居。早在三百多年以前，定居在嫩江沿岸各地的达呼尔人就从事农、林、牧、猎业等多种生产。
    解放前达呼尔人的土地，多半都集中在地主富农手里，封建剥削严重阻碍了农业生产的发展，民族压迫、封建剥削和日本帝国主义的侵略，使达呼尔族的经济和文化都停滞在落后的状态下，达呼尔族劳动人民过着十分贫困的生活。
    解放后，达呼尔族居住地区进行了土地制度的改革，生产有了很大发展。现在，达呼尔农民已基本实现了半社会主义性质的农业合作化，并且有许多合作社已过渡到社会主义性质的高级农业生产合作社了。
    几年来，国家给予他们以二十多万元的贷款，大大地扶助山区达呼尔人的农业生产。此外，还在达呼尔人聚居区建立两个供销社，六个购销站，七个信用社，两个兽医所。
    达呼尔族实行一夫一妻的婚姻制。信仰萨满教，崇拜多神，也有人信喇嘛教。
    鄂伦春族
    鄂伦春民族是我国人数较少的一个少数民族，分布在内蒙古自治区东部和黑龙江省北部接壤的大、小兴安岭森林地区。共有二千二百多人，其中一千二百人居住在黑龙江省黑河专区，在内蒙古自治区的有九百多人。
    鄂伦春的社会基层组织有较明显的氏族或部落的残痕，一般内部还保持着民主决定问题的习惯。这个民族擅长射击，主要以狩猎为生。部分人兼营农业，有的则已转为林业工人。
    解放几年来鄂伦春民族不论在政治、经济、文化等方面都有极大的进步。1951年10月建立了鄂伦春自治旗，1957年10月间，自治旗基本上实现了全旗猎民定居。以“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的分配原则代替了“共同劳动，平均分配”的原则。过去，鄂伦春人文化、卫生条件极差，几乎整个民族都是文盲，只有个别人认识些满文。现在自治旗有二所小学，在校学生二百一十四名。（附图片）
