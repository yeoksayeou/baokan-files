Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 8th (TASS): According to news from Paraguay, the movement against the Stroessner dictatorship in Paraguay is intensifying and an armed uprising movement has begun.

Newspapers report that the "Citizen Army for the Liberation of Paraguay" has emerged in Paraguay. The headquarters of this army is located in Southern Paraguay. A statement issued by the rebel army states that their purpose is to abolish the existing autocratic regime and establish a democratic government. It is estimated that the rebel army has more than a thousand people.

Armed conflicts have occurred in San Jose, Encarnación, and other places.

"Xinwen Bao" ("News") reports that "a revolutionary movement is developing" in Asunción, the capital of Paraguay, and leaders of various political groups are participating in this movement, including even some representatives of the ruling "National Republican Association." These people are dissatisfied with the policies of the current government and want to organize a constitutional democratic government on the basis of normal general elections.

Discontent expressed in various forms can be seen throughout the country. In recent days, residents of Coronel Bogado and farmers in nearby rural areas protested against the government's commercial policies. On April 5, sailors in Pilar (on the banks of the Paraguay River, south of Asunción) rioted.

Associated Press reports that "a tense situation is palpable" in Asunción. There are very few pedestrians on the streets of the Paraguayan capital. Police and soldiers patrol the streets, stopping pedestrians and cars to check documents. The Paraguayan police have carried out large-scale arrests. A curfew has been imposed in Asunción. The army is on alert.

    拉丁美洲反独裁浪潮滚滚
    巴拉圭爆发武装起义
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯8日讯：据来自巴拉圭的消息，巴拉圭全国反对斯特罗斯纳独裁政权的运动正在日益加强。而且已经展开武装起义运动。
    据报纸报道，在巴拉圭出现了“争取巴拉圭自由公民军”，这支军队的司令部设在南巴拉圭。起义军发表的公告说，他们的目的是要取消现存的专制政权，建立民主政权。估计起义的军队有一千多人。
    在圣约瑟、恩卡尔纳西昂以及其他一些地方发生了武装冲突。
    “新闻报”报道说，巴拉圭首都亚松森的“革命运动正在发展”，参加这一运动的有各政治集团的领导人，其中甚至包括执政党“国家共和党”的某些代表人物。这些人对现政权的政策表示不满，想在正常普选的基础上组织立宪民主政府。
    以各种形式爆发出来的不满情绪在全国各地都可看到。最近几天科洛耐尔—博加多城的居民和附近农村的农民抗议政府的商业政策。4月5日彼拉尔市（亚松森以南的巴拉圭河畔）的水手曾发生骚乱。
    美联社报道说，在亚松森“明显地感到局势紧张”。巴拉圭首都各街道上行人极少。警察和军队在街上巡逻，遇到行人和汽车就加以拦阻，检查证件，巴拉圭的警察进行了大规模的逮捕。在亚松森实行了宵禁。军队都作好了战斗准备。
