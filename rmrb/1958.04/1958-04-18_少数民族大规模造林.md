Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: The people of all ethnic minorities across the country are engaged in large-scale afforestation, advancing towards barren mountains and lands, and waging a tenacious struggle against wind and sand. They are determined to transform their hometowns into places shaded by green trees.

In many areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, sandstorms have threatened the health of people and livestock and a large amount of farmland for many years. This year, people of all ethnic groups began to build protective forest belts on a large scale. The people of the Jirem League broke with convention this year and started afforestation in freezing conditions before the land had thawed. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has put forward the resounding slogan of "turning Xinjiang into a Jiangnan beyond the Great Wall," and the entire region will afforest more than three million mu this year. In many places, the afforestation time has been advanced by nearly a month compared with previous years. Cities in the autonomous region have also launched afforestation competitions. After twenty days of hard work, the people of the ancient city of Kashgar have planted more than 5.5 million trees, and the city has completed its afforestation task ahead of schedule. Yining, known as the garden city, will ensure that every courtyard has an orchard and every room has potted flowers this year. In Lhasa, Xigaze, Qamdo, Shannan and other places in Tibet, 500,000 trees have been planted. Many Tibetan officials and Tibetan and Hui youths have joined the afforestation upsurge. This year, Qamdo Prefecture also planted 2,000 apple saplings transported from Henan Province.

A characteristic of the afforestation movement in ethnic minority areas this year is the change from the past sporadic and scattered afforestation to large-scale afforestation by joint townships and joint cooperatives, which can solve the difficulties of large land area and small labor force in ethnic minority areas. The people of all ethnic groups along the Yellow River and Huangshui River basins in Qinghai Province are unfolding large-scale afforestation according to the division of sections along a river and a mountain range by joint counties, joint townships and joint cooperatives. All parts of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have adopted the method of collectively going up the mountains to live on the mountains, dividing and contracting plots, and short-term shock tactics, which greatly accelerated the speed of afforestation. In just over a month, the entire autonomous region afforested more than 18 million mu, and large areas of 50,000, 70,000, and 100,000 mu emerged.

In afforestation, the people of all ethnic minorities demonstrated an indomitable revolutionary spirit. In many places, every household was mobilized, and men, women, old and young worked together. They persisted in hard work day and night in wind, sand, and blizzards. In some areas, construction sheds were everywhere, and people ate and lived on the mountains. In some places, lanterns and torches lit up all night, and the sound of reed pipes and gongs shook the valleys. In the famous national "Miao Fir" producing area—the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture—more than 600,000 laborers have participated in the afforestation movement every day since the Spring Festival. After forty days and nights of hard work, 8.88 million mu of forest have been created. This autonomous prefecture has basically completed the afforestation task. Songtao Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province also launched "Afforestation Day" and "Afforestation Week" activities to create Youth Forests, Women's Forests, and Happiness Forests. All barren mountains, barren land, and beside houses, roads, and villages in the county were planted with tree seedlings. In the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, the afforestation area this year will also greatly exceed that of previous years.

The quality of afforestation in ethnic minority areas this year is generally higher than in previous years. The people of all ethnic minorities in the mountainous areas of Guizhou Province have widely promoted the responsibility system of contracting for planting, survival, tending, and afforestation. The forests created generally meet the specifications. In some areas, universal soil turning, comprehensive land preparation, and careful planting and construction have been carried out, making the tree growth rate more than twice as fast as pit planting. In many areas of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, simultaneous afforestation and inspection are implemented this year, and the survival rate reaches more than 85% to 90%.

    少数民族大规模造林
    新华社16日讯　全国各少数民族人民正在大规模地植树造林，向荒山、荒地进军，向风沙展开顽强斗争，立志要把自己的家乡变成绿树成荫的地方。
    在内蒙古自治区的许多地方，风沙灾害经年威胁着人畜健康和大量农田，各族人民今年开始大规模地营造防护林带。哲里木盟人民今年打破了常规，在土地还没解冻时就顶冻造林。新疆维吾尔自治区已提出“把新疆变成塞外江南”的响亮口号，全区今年要造林三百多万亩。很多地方的造林时间比往年提早了近一个月。自治区各城市还展开了造林竞赛。古城喀什的人民经过二十天苦战，已植树五百五十多万株，全市提前完成植树造林的任务。被称为花园城市的伊宁，今年要做到院院有果园，室室有盆花。西藏的拉萨、日喀则、昌都、山南等地，已植树五十万株。许多藏族官员和藏、回族青年都投入了造林热潮。昌都地区今年还栽植了二千株从河南省运去的苹果树苗。
    少数民族地区今年造林运动的特点，是改变了过去零星和分散造林的现象，实行联乡、联社的大面积造林，这样就可以解决少数民族地区地面大、人力少的困难。青海省沿黄河和湟水流域的各族人民，正按着一条河流、一条山脉，联县、联乡、联社的划片分段，展开大面积造林。广西僮族自治区各地大都采取集体上山住山，划片包干和短期突击的办法，大大加快了造林速度，全自治区仅在一个多月内就造林一千八百多万亩，并出现了五万、七万和十万亩的大面积林。
    在植树造林中，各少数民族人民表现了无坚不摧的革命干劲。许多地方家家出动，男女老少一齐动手，他们在风沙和大风雪中日夜坚持苦战。有些地区是工棚遍地，人们吃、住都在山上。有的地方彻夜灯笼火把，芦笙锣鼓声震动山谷。著名全国的“苗杉”产地——黔东南苗族侗族自治州，春节后每天都有六十多万个劳动力参加造林运动，经过四十昼夜苦战，造林八百八十多万亩，这个自治州已基本完成植树造林任务。贵州松桃苗族自治县还开展了“造林日”和“造林周”的活动，营造青年林、妇女林、幸福林，全县的荒山、荒地以及宅旁、路旁、寨旁全都栽上了树苗。云南省的西双版纳傣族自治州和德宏傣族景颇族自治州，今年的造林面积也都将大大超过往年。
    少数民族地区今年造林的质量，普遍比往年提高。贵州山区各少数民族人民广泛推行了包栽、包活、包抚育、包成林的责任制度，造的林大都合乎规格要求。有的地区还做到普遍翻土、全面整地和细栽细造，使树木生长速度比挖坑造林快一倍以上。广西僮族自治区许多地区今年实行边造林边检查，成活率达到85％到90％以上。
