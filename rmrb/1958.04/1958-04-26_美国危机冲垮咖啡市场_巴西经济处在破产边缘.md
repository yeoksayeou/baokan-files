Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, April 24th: Brazil's economic and financial situation is becoming increasingly difficult under the influence of the American economic crisis. According to the "Last Hour" newspaper, Brazilians generally believe that Brazil is on the verge of bankruptcy.

    Brazil's main export is coffee, and 70% of its foreign exchange comes from coffee sales. However, the United States has recently reduced its purchases of Brazilian coffee and vigorously lowered coffee prices, which has had a serious impact on Brazil. According to Brazilian newspapers, the price of Brazilian coffee on the New York market has recently fallen from $0.595 per pound a year ago to $0.545 per pound. Coffee exports in the first three months of this year decreased by more than 40% compared to the first three months of last year, and the number of exports to the west coast of the United States decreased from 7,200 tons at the beginning of last year to 4,100 tons at the beginning of this year.

    The reduction in Brazilian coffee exports has resulted in a huge trade deficit for Brazil. In 1956, Brazil's foreign trade had a surplus, but in 1957, the foreign trade deficit reached as high as 97 million US dollars. At the same time, Brazil's foreign exchange reserves have also decreased significantly. At the beginning of this year, Brazil's foreign exchange reserves were less than 10 million US dollars, while a year ago they were 100 million US dollars.

    Brazil's domestic unsold coffee stocks have increased sharply. According to materials from the National Bureau of Statistics, as of March 31 this year, 12.96 million bags of coffee (each bag calculated at 60 kilograms) had accumulated in Brazilian warehouses.

    In order to cope with the problem of coffee overproduction, the Brazilian government has spent 14 billion Cruzeiros to purchase coffee. However, this measure has not been effective and, on the contrary, has deepened financial difficulties. In 1957, the government's budget deficit reached 41 billion Cruzeiros, and in 1958 it is estimated to increase further to 45 billion Cruzeiros. At the same time, Brazil's currency in circulation has increased from 69.3 billion Cruzeiros at the end of 1955 to more than 100 billion Cruzeiros currently. The Cruzeiro is rapidly depreciating, and prices are soaring.

    Brazil's economic and financial difficulties have caused great domestic unrest. There is also an increasing number of voices in Brazil calling on the government to improve people's lives, get rid of dependence on the United States, and expand trade with the socialist camp in order to alleviate economic difficulties.

### 美国危机冲垮咖啡市场  巴西经济处在破产边缘

    美国危机冲垮咖啡市场
    巴西经济处在破产边缘
    据新华社24日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西经济和财政情况在美国经济危机的影响下变得越来越困难。据“最后一点钟”报报道，巴西人目前普遍认为，巴西正处在破产的边缘。
    巴西的主要出口品是咖啡，它的外汇70％都是靠出售咖啡而得来的。然而美国最近却减少巴西咖啡的收购，并且大力压低咖啡价格，这就对巴西发生了严重的影响。据巴西报刊报道，纽约市场上巴西咖啡的价格最近已经从一年前的每磅○·五九五美元跌到每磅○·五四五美元。咖啡出口量在今年头三个月比去年头三个月减少40％以上，对美国西海岸的输出的数目从去年年初的七千二百吨减至今年年初的四千一百吨。
    巴西咖啡出口的减少使巴西的对外贸易出现巨大的逆差。在1956年，巴西的对外贸易是有盈余的，但1957年对外贸易逆差却高达九千七百万美元。同时，巴西的外汇储备也大大下降。在今年年初，巴西所拥有的外汇储备不到一千万美元，而一年前还有一亿美元。
    巴西国内卖不出去的咖啡存货急剧增加。根据国家统计局的材料，到今年3月31日为止，巴西仓库里，已经积压了一千二百九十六万袋咖啡（每袋以六十公斤计算）。
    巴西政府为了应付咖啡生产过剩的问题，已经花费了一百四十亿克鲁赛罗来收购咖啡。但是这个措施并没有收到效果，相反地却加深了财政的困难。1957年，政府的预算赤字达四百一十亿克鲁赛罗，而1958年估计将再增至四百五十亿克鲁赛罗。同时，巴西的货币流通量已从1955年年底的六百九十三亿克鲁赛罗增加到目前的一千亿克鲁赛罗以上。克鲁赛罗正急剧贬值，物价也在飞涨。
    巴西的经济财政困难已经引起国内很大的不安。巴西国内目前也越来越多地听到要求政府改善人民生活、摆脱对美国的依赖和扩大同社会主义阵营的贸易以减轻经济困难的呼声。
