Title: First Time on the Top of a Blast Furnace

The repair shop in front of Blast Furnace No. 1 was already buzzing before dawn. Amidst the noise, some were busy putting on work clothes, some were hurrying to eat breakfast. I, a new apprentice who had been in the factory for less than two months, also put on my work clothes, put on my safety helmet, and stood with several masters. We gathered around the team leader—Master Dong—listening to his final instructions. Master Dong was an old hand at maintaining and repairing blast furnaces, calm and collected, but my heart was pounding. The top of the blast furnace was so high, the space was narrow, and there were so many people, not to mention working, even visiting would be a bit dangerous....

I followed several masters up the hundred or so narrow and steep iron ladders, and through the hot blast stove to reach the blast furnace top section. I was panting. In an instant, the blast furnace and the hot blast stove, up and down, were arrayed for action. Fitters, riveters, welders, riggers... whether they were young men with rosy cheeks or old masters with wrinkles left by hard work, they all threw themselves into the battle like tigers. The voices were noisy, and the clanging of iron hammers and the hissing of electric welding were intertwined. I stood near the charging port on the blast furnace, and looking south, I saw three red big-character posters already posted on the black cauldron-like top of the hot blast stove. A master said excitedly, "Those are the challenge letters and acceptance letters proposed by our furnace top section and hot blast stove section..."

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew, sand and rocks flew, and I couldn't even open my eyes. A body full of flue dust and sand poured down my neck, and mixed with the sweat on my body into mud, stuck to my skin, itchy and painful, really uncomfortable. "Go! Let's dismantle the screws," Master Zhang shouted, and we took a large wrench weighing five or six kilograms to dismantle the screws on the manhole cover of the bleeder pipe. In less than an hour, all twenty large screws were removed, and the manhole cover was opened.

"You rest here for a while, and watch the tools." Master Zhang said this obviously because he was afraid that I would be afraid of working at high altitude for the first time, and he took special care of me. Before he could say anything further, I hurriedly interjected, "I'll go to the top too, I can't come down without taking a look!"

I followed the master up the straight ladder to the top of the blast furnace—the bleeder pipe—and saw Master Dong and several other masters busy dismantling and replacing the four bleeder pipe covers, each weighing about three hundred kilograms.

I and another apprentice swept away the accumulated sand and rust on the screws around the bleeder pipe. Sometimes, I delivered tools to the masters. Standing on this furnace top, about fourteen stories high, and suddenly looking down, it seemed like a bottomless abyss, really a bit creepy. Seeing the people working on the ground, let alone how big they were, even the trains speeding nearby looked like children's toys. Suddenly, the smoke, steam, and coal gas released by the small blast furnace were blown over by the southeast wind, turning into a white cloud rolling under my feet, really like riding the clouds.

I leaned on the iron railing to tighten the screws. Sometimes, I couldn't get my hands and feet to work, so I had to stick my head out. At this time, looking down again, even though it was a bottomless abyss, my heart didn't beat and my head didn't spin. Although the cold wind blew through my cotton coat, the sweat on my face still rolled down. I thought of going to visit the blast furnace in the past, and I hid far away when I walked to the tapping hole under the furnace to watch the tapping, for fear of being burned by the splashing sparks. Hearing the rumbling sound of burning in the blast furnace, I dared not approach it even more.

Looking up, I saw Master Dong squatting across from me, working. This was an old master with nearly thirty years of service. He was always conscientious and dedicated in his work, and loved the factory like his home. When it came to this maintenance period, he took the lead and worked selflessly. At noon, he asked the workers to take turns going down to eat, but he himself didn't move, and continued to work as usual. He hadn't had a drop of water or a bite to eat for eight consecutive hours, but he was still energetic and not tired at all. He really put his whole heart into the maintenance work! Master Dong said at the pre-shift meeting, "This time the blast furnace overhaul, if we can finish one hour ahead of schedule, we can produce more than twenty tons of pig iron. This is our best contribution to the country..."

Our work was completed smoothly. A master said to me with a proud tone, "Look at the watch, what time is it?"
"A quarter past three!..."

After a while, the loudspeakers successively broadcast the good news that the hot blast stove and blast furnace sections had completed their work ahead of schedule. We fired the first shot in the Great Leap Forward. (Attached picture)

    第一次上高炉顶
    石景山钢铁厂徒工　孙世恺
    天才蒙蒙亮，一号高炉前的修理房里就沸腾起来了。人们在喧闹声中，有的忙穿工作服，有的赶吃早点，我这进厂不到两个月的新徒工也穿上工作服，戴上安全帽，和几位师傅站在一起。围着组长——董师傅，听他的最后指示。董师傅是维护修理高炉的老手。沉着镇静，我的心可跳得厉害。高炉顶那样高，地方窄小，人又挤，不用说干活，就是参观也有些危险……。
    我跟着几位师傅登上一百多节又窄又陡的铁梯，穿过热风炉才到高炉炉顶工段。我喘得上气不接下气。刹时间，高炉和热风炉的上上下下，摆成了阵势，钳工、铆工、电气焊工、起重工……不管是脸颊红朴朴的青年小伙子，还是满脸堆着辛勤劳动留下皱纹的老师傅，都像生龙活虎一样投入了战斗。人声嘈杂，铁锤的叮噹响和电气焊的嘶嘶声交织在一起。我站在高炉上的进料口附近，往南一看，瞅见黑锅底一样的热风炉顶上已经连续贴出三张红色的大字报。有位师傅兴高采烈地说：“那是咱炉顶工段和热风炉工段提出的挑战书和应战书……”
    忽然吹过一阵风，飞沙走石，连眼睛都睁不开。从我脖子灌了一身烟渣和沙土，和身上的汗水混成泥了，都贴在肉皮上又痒又痛，实在不好受。“走！咱们去拆螺丝。”张师傅喊了声，我们便拿着五、六公斤重的大搬子去拆卸放熂筒人孔盖上的螺丝。不到一个小时，把二十个大螺丝全拆下来，打开了人孔盖。
    “你在这休息一下，看着工具。”张师傅这句话，显然是怕我第一次到高空作业害怕，特意加以照顾，我没等他再说下去，就急忙插嘴说：“我也到顶上去，不能干活看看再下来！”
    我跟着师傅爬上直梯，到了高炉的顶峰——放熂筒上，看到董师傅和其他几位师傅正忙着拆换四个都约有三百公斤重的放熂筒盖。
    我跟另一个徒工打扫放熂筒周围淤积的沙土和螺丝上的铁锈。有时，又给师傅递送些工具。站在这约有十四层楼高的炉顶上，猛低头往下一瞧，好像是万丈深渊，真有些毛骨悚然，看到地上干活的人就不说是多大了，连在附近飞驰的火车也宛如孩子们的玩具。突然间，小高炉放出的烟、蒸汽、煤汽、被东南风吹过来了，变成一片白云在脚下滚滚而过，真像腾云驾雾一样。
    我依靠着铁栏杆紧螺丝，有时干活不得手脚，不得不把头伸出去，这时再往下看，尽管是万丈深渊，心不跳，头也不晕。一阵阵地寒风虽然吹透了棉衣，满脸的汗珠照样往下滚。想到过去到高炉来参观，走到炉下的出铁口看出铁都躲得远远的，怕崩出的火花烧了。听到高炉里燃烧的轰隆声更不敢接近它。
    抬头看到蹲在对面干活的董师傅，这是一位有近三十年工龄的老师傅，平日干活兢兢业业，爱厂如家，到了这个检修的时候，更是奋不顾身的带头干。中午，他叫工友们轮流下去吃饭，可是，他自己却不动窝，照常坚持干，已经一连八个小时，没进一点水，没吃一口饭，依然是精神奕奕，毫无倦意，真是把整个心都放在检修工作上啦！董师傅在班前会上说：“这次高炉检修，我们要提前一个小时完工，就能多出二十多吨生铁，这是我们对国家最好的贡献……”
    我们的活顺利地干完了。有位师傅带着一股自豪的口吻对我说：“看看表，几点啦？”
    “三点过一刻！……”
    再过一会儿，扩音器里陆续传出热风炉、高炉各工段提前完工的捷报。我们在大跃进中打响了第一炮。（附图片）
