Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 17th. The Hungarian National Table Tennis Team played ten matches against the Tianjin Municipal Table Tennis Team in Tianjin on the evening of April 17th, winning all ten games with a score of two to zero in each match.

The audience watched the match between Guo Zhonggong, a sixteen-year-old player from the Tianjin team, and Földi with great interest. Guo Zhonggong was the runner-up in last year's National Youth Table Tennis Tournament. He adopted an offensive strategy as soon as he took the court, often placing the ball in the opponent's right corner, preventing Földi, who uses a left-handed horizontal grip, from successfully executing his specialty smash. However, the experienced Földi quickly adopted countermeasures, using backhand attacks to win repeatedly.

    十场二比零
    匈乒乓球队胜天津队
    据新华社天津17日电　匈牙利国家乒乓球队17日晚在天津同天津市乒乓球队举行十场比赛，获得了全胜，每场的比数都是二比零。
    观众们怀着极大的兴趣观看了年仅十六岁的天津队选手郭仲恭对福尔迪的比赛。郭仲恭是去年全国青少年乒乓球赛的亚军，他一上场就采取攻势，并经常把球调在对方的右角，使左手横握球拍的福尔迪不能顺利的发挥扣杀的专长。但是有经验的福尔迪很快的就采取对策，用反手攻球，连连得胜。
