Xinhua News Agency, Baoding News: Recently, three agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry middle schools run by the township people's committees have appeared in Nanhe County, Hebei Province.

    The agricultural middle school is run by the Chengguan Township People's Committee, with the assistance of the county education section, agricultural bureau, and forestry section, enrolling fifty students. Students spend one-half or one-third of their time participating in labor. The school's funding is resolved by contracting out the temporary labor and fodder collection for the entire year for the nursery (more than eighty mu, formerly a county farm), and using the labor remuneration.

    The forestry middle school, enrolling fifty students, is run by the Sansi Township People's Committee, with the assistance of the county education section and forestry section. The existing 3,000 mu of state-owned forest serves as the school's experimental garden, with students spending half of their time on labor and half on learning. The funding and students' living expenses are covered by the labor portion of the afforestation fees and replanting fees allocated by higher authorities, as well as income from pruning branches, collecting fodder, and intercropping cotton in the forest.

    The animal husbandry middle school, enrolling one hundred students, is organized by the Chengguan Township People's Committee, with the assistance of the county education section and the county supply and marketing cooperative. Students spend half their time learning and half on labor. The supply and marketing cooperative's pig farm serves as the experimental farm, raising 500 pigs, with one-fifth of the income from live pigs, piglets, and pig manure going to the students as labor remuneration.

    The county also plans to establish a fisheries middle school in Zuo Lizhao Village soon. This village is low-lying, with a large pit of more than 100 mu and many small ponds, making it very suitable for fish farming.

    河北南和县出现三所乡办职业中学
    据新华社保定讯　河北省南和县最近出现了三所由乡人民委员会主办的农业、林业、畜牧中学。
    农业中学由城关乡人民委员会主办，县教育科、农业局、林业科协助，招生五十名。学生参加劳动的时间占二分之一或三分之一。学校经费是把苗圃（八十多亩，原是县农场）全年临时用工和打饲草包起来，用劳动报酬解决的。
    林业中学招生五十名，是由三思乡人民委员会主办，县教育科、林业科协助。以原有的三千亩国营林为学校实验园地，学生参加劳动和学习时间各占二分之一。经费和学生的生活费来源从上级拨发的育林费、补植费人工部分和修剪树枝、打饲草、林棉兼作等收入解决。
    畜牧中学招生一百名，主办机关是城关乡人民委员会，由县教育科和县供销社协助。学生学习和劳动时间各占二分之一。以供销社猪场为实验场，养猪五百头，供销社以生猪、仔猪、猪粪收入的五分之一作为学生劳动报酬。
    这县还打算最近在左李召村再办一个渔业中学。这个村地势低洼，有个一百多亩大的水坑，还有很多小池塘，很适宜养鱼。
