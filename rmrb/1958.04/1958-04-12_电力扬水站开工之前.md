    Before the Opening of the Electric Pumping Station
		Zou Difan
    This is the time when the seventh and ninth days thaw and the eighth and ninth days see the geese arrive. The accumulated snow on the banks of Guanting Lake has gradually melted, and the green lake water is rippling with waves, with fishing boats moving on it. In the blue sky, wild eagles are screaming, and magpies are chirping on the willows waiting to turn green. Taking a walk in the open fields, the cool wind expands one's heart.
    The five electric pumping stations on the banks of Guanting Lake in Huailai County are about to start construction. People can see the red flags of the surveying team moving along the lake between the remaining snow, thin ice, sparse trees, and earthen houses, as if torches were burning brightly in the wilderness.
    The five electric pumping stations will irrigate 100,000 mu of farmland, equivalent to half of the county's water conservancy tasks this year. They will transform the sandy wasteland and waterlogged depressions of twenty-five cooperatives into fertile land and lay a foundation for the electrification of the entire county. However, this is also a considerable project, with a total of 320,000 cubic meters of earthwork, requiring the mobilization of 10,000 full-time laborers to complete in twenty days of hard work. This is also the most important time to prepare for spring plowing, and making sure that the project and spring plowing are not delayed is a major organizational task.
    I remember when Geng Changchun, the secretary of the township party committee, and Liu Zhensheng, the deputy director of the cooperative, returned from the secondary-level cadre meeting in Shacheng, they immediately formulated the production and construction plan for the entire Xiyulin Cooperative for 1958 and the second five-year plan. In 1958 alone, the grain yield per mu was to increase from last year's one hundred and several dozen catties to four hundred catties. Pig raising was to increase from last year's one thousand three hundred pigs to sixteen thousand pigs. Afforestation was to cover one thousand mu, one million five hundred thousand catties of green fodder was to be harvested, five hundred thousand catties of fish was to be produced, seven hundred thousand catties of fruit was to be produced, and two thousand new fruit trees were to be planted... This is a production plan for a cooperative with only nine hundred households and four thousand people. It goes without saying that it will be impossible to achieve the goal of a land of fish and rice and a land of flowers and fruits without hard work. The pumping station project is an important measure to ensure a bumper harvest. More than 50% of Xiyulin Cooperative's strong labor force will be invested in this project. Detailed organizational work is underway here, and a hot and lively production and construction movement is burning fiercely.
    At night, the half moon shines on the five open-air meeting places, and the northwest wind outside the Great Wall is like splashing frost, with temperatures around minus twenty degrees Celsius. But more than eight hundred people are listening to the township and cooperative leaders reciting such numerical poems, because every number is so closely related to them. When the reporter announced that the pumping station was about to start construction and that preparations for spring plowing must be done well before the start of construction, I heard a buzzing sound like spring thunder in the meeting place. People were discussing how to allocate labor, how to rush to complete the rear work, how to support the water conservancy front...
    The next day, the township and cooperative leaders went to the fields. The number of people on duty that day was more than double that of the previous two days. Because the pumping station was to start construction on March 6th, people had to rush to complete some work, such as digging fish ponds, opening drainage ditches, accumulating and delivering fertilizer, and scraping fruit trees. In addition, after the strong labor force goes to the front line, how should the work in the rear be carried out? One person must do the work of two, and one day must be like two days. In various labor and production places, during rest time, heart-to-heart talks were held to discuss the great leap forward in production, and a movement of "no idle person in every household" was unfolding magnificently.
    It was already eleven o'clock at night. Although the moonlight was dim, the sound of iron picks and shovels hitting the frozen soil could be heard booming in the fields east of Xiyulin. It was these strong young men who were working overnight to open up the unfinished drainage ditches in order to go to the pumping station front line. They also had to rush to complete some heavy work, leaving lighter work for the elderly, children, and women to undertake. And in the courtyards of the village, students were surrounding the female cadres who had been sent down to learn the songs printed in the "Great Wall Daily," such as "The Agricultural Cooperative is Home" and "Singing the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Development Program." The singing rose in the quiet village, and listening to it was like hearing a peaceful hymn.
    Walking past the paper window of the first production team's team headquarters, shadows were swaying on the window paper. A "Five Official Meeting" was being held on the warm kang. This was a meeting of the sheep herder, donkey driver, cart driver, cattle herder, and feeder. In response to the call for a great leap forward in production, they were ensuring that cattle had calves, sheep had lambs, going out early and returning late, and protecting livestock and keeping them strong. People all know that the one driving the cart must be a strong man. They guaranteed that they would drive the cart during the day and push the cart to deliver manure at night. If you ask them how many labor days they plan to do this year, they will tell you heroically: "Three hundred and eighty!" Because, except for rainy days when the cart cannot move, many nights will be made up of new labor days.
    In the beautiful season, engaging in magnificent construction projects is truly like riding a swift horse in the spring breeze. Take a walk in Xiyulin Village. The red Spring Festival couplets give people so much joy. One place is written with:
    The source of the great river and deep stream is abundant
    The old tree has new branches and a hundred flowers are fragrant Some families have posted Spring Festival couplets selected from the People's Daily supplement:
    Increased production is better than a money tree
    Frugality is like a treasure pot This "abundant source" makes me think of the water conservancy project of the pumping station, and "fragrant hundred flowers" and "money tree" make me unable to forget the old people who are scraping trees and pruning branches in the crabapple forests, apricot forests, and hawthorn forests to support the pumping station project.
    The early spring cuckoo, calling from which forest, which sky, the old people carry wooden ladders and take scrapers and scissors to the forest. They scraped out the green of the tree trunks, stripped off the insect-eaten rotten bark, and leaf buds have already adorned the branches. Experienced old farmers know from these earliest branches how many flowers there will be and what kind of harvest the fruits will bring. These old people have been "long-term workers" for decades, as if they had signed a contract of servitude with the landlords. Now they hold work point books in their hands, recording their diligent virtues.
    The action of accumulating and delivering fertilizer is almost a general mobilization. Three diligence (diligent bedding, diligent latrine cleaning, diligent sweeping) and six turnovers (livestock pens, toilets, pigsties, pits, kang, chicken coops, etc.) are being carried out by everyone. I don't know how many catties of fertilizer the entire cooperative has accumulated now, but I know that more than 300,000 catties of fertilizer have been delivered to the fields.
    This is truly a cooperative that has achieved no idle person in every household, or more precisely, a cooperative where everyone is diligent and thrifty. They have allocated all their labor forces to rush ahead of time to complete the logistics work before the pumping station starts construction, so that the spring plowing preparations are fully completed and the pumping station project is irrigated ahead of schedule.
    In our countryside, I seem to see countless giants with three heads and six arms creating new history and doing groundbreaking work. I firmly believe that under their hands of cutting through thorns, no difficulties cannot be overcome, and no work cannot be completed.

### 电力扬水站开工之前

    电力扬水站开工之前
　　邹荻帆
    这正是七九冻开，八九雁来的时候。官厅湖畔的积雪已逐渐溶化，绿色的湖水正漾着微波，打鱼船在上面游动。蓝色的天空中，野鹰在尖叫，喜鹊在待绿的压头柳上鸣噪。在旷野中走一走，清冷的风使人心胸扩展。
    怀来县官厅湖畔的五个电力扬水站正要动工，人们可以看见在残雪、薄冰、疏树、土屋之间，测量队的红旗在湖畔移动，仿佛火炬在原野上烧亮了一样。
    五个电力扬水站将灌溉十万亩田地，相当于全县今年水利任务的一半。将使二十五个社的沙荒变良田、涝洼变富川，还给全县电气化打下一个基础。但是，这也是个不小的工程，全部工程有三十二万土方，要动员一万个整劳动力，苦战二十天才能完成，而这又正是准备春耕最重要的时刻，要使工程春耕两不误，是件重大的组织工作。
    我记得当乡党委书记耿长春和副社长刘振声，从沙城参加二级干部会议回来，立即制订了西榆林全社的1958年和第二个五年计划的生产建设规划。就在1958年，粮食亩产要从去年的一百几十斤，达到四百斤。养猪要从去年的一千三百多头，达到一万六千头。要造林一千亩，打青饲料一百五十万斤，打鱼五十万斤，产水果七十万斤，新栽果树两万棵，还要开稻田一千五百亩……这是一个只有九百来户、四千口人的合作社生产规划，不用说明，如果不经历苦战，是无法达到鱼米乡、花果乡的目标的。扬水站的工程，就是保证丰收的重要措施，西榆林社50％以上的强劳动力都要投入这工程，一个细致的组织工作正在这里进行，一个热火朝天的生产建设运动正在这里熊熊燃烧。
    晚上，半边月亮照着五个露天会场，长城外的西北风竟像泼着冰霜一样，这里是零下二十度左右。但八百多人都听着乡社负责人朗诵这种数字的诗，因为每一个数字对他们都是那样关系密切。当报告人宣布扬水站就要开工，在开工之前，一定要做好春耕准备工作时，我听到会场中嗡嗡的春雷一样的声音，人们在商量如何调配劳力，如何突击完成后方工作，如何支持水利前线……
    就在第二天，乡社负责人都到田地上去了。这天，出勤的人数比前两天超过了一倍多。因为3月6号，扬水站就要开工，人们要突击完成一些工作，譬如挖养鱼池，开积流沟，积肥送肥，刮果树等。此外，当强劳力开赴前方之后，后方的工作该怎样进行，必须一个人当两个人，一天当两天才行。就在各个劳动生产的场所，利用休息时间，又开了生产大跃进谈心会，一个“户户无闲人”的运动正波澜壮阔地展开。
    夜已经十一时，虽然月光蒙蒙，在西榆林东边的田野，铁镐铁铲撞击冻土的声音却轰轰可闻，正是这些强有力的青壮年，为了即将奔赴扬水站前线，他们连夜在打通尚未完成的积流沟。他们还要突击完成一些重活，留下较轻的活，让老幼妇女承当。而在村子的庭院中，学生们正围着下放的女干部，在学习“长城报”上所刊印的歌曲，如“农业社就是家”、“歌唱农业发展纲要四十条”等，歌声在宁静的村子升起，听着它，仿佛听到一只和平的赞美诗。
    走过第一生产队队部的纸窗，人影在窗纸上摇晃。在暖炕上正在开“五倌会”，这就是羊倌、驴倌、车倌、牛倌、饲养员的会，为了响应生产大跃进的号召，他们在保证牛添牛犊，羊添羔子，早出晚归，保畜保膘。人们都知道，赶大车的必是壮健汉子，他们保证说：白天赶车，晚上推车送粪。如果你问他们今年计划干多少个劳动日，他们会豪迈地告诉你：“三百八十个！”因为，除了雨天，大车无法出动外，好多个晚上都将组成新的劳动日。
    在美好的季节，从事宏壮的建设事业，正是春风得意马蹄急。在西榆林村走一趟吧，红色的春联给人们多少喜悦，这一处写着：
    大河深川源头盛
    老树新枝百花香有些家贴着的是从人民日报副刊上选来的春联：
    增产胜过摇钱树
    节约好似聚宝盆这“源头盛”使我想着扬水站的水利工程，而“百花香”、“摇钱树”，却使我不能忘怀那些为了支持扬水站工程，正在海棠林、杏树林、红果林……刮树剪枝的老人们。
    早春的布谷鸟，不知从哪一片树林、哪一方天空叫着，老人们就搬着木梯，拿着刮刀和剪子到树林中去了。他们刮出了树干的绿色，剥去了虫蚀的腐皮，叶芽已经缀在枝头。有经验的老农民，从这最早枝条，就知道花会有多少朵，果实会有怎样的收获。这些老人过去几十年都是“长工”，仿佛给地主写下了卖身契，现在他们手上拿着工分簿，记录着他们勤劳的德性。
    积肥送粪的行动，差不多是总动员起来了。三勤（勤垫圈、勤起厕、勤打扫）六翻身（畜圈、厕所、猪圈、坑塘、火炕、鸡窝等翻身）正在人人动手。我不知道全社现在已经积了多少斤肥，但我知道有三十多万斤肥料已经送到田地上去了。
    这是真正的达到户户无闲人的社，更正确地说，是人人都勤俭的社。他们调配了全部劳动力量，要抢在时间的前面，完成扬水站开工之前的后勤工作，达到春耕准备圆满完成，扬水站工程提前灌溉。
    在我们的农村，我仿佛看到无数三头六臂的巨人，在创造新历史，在进行开天辟地的工作。我坚决相信在他们披荆斩棘的手掌下，没有困难不能克服，没有工作不能完成。
