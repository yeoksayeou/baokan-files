    Editorial Remarks:
    We Communists must have lofty ideals, but also solid work to realize these ideals. Without ideals, all our work would lose its driving force, and without solid work, ideals would also fall flat.
    Our aim to realize the Forty Articles of the National Program for Agricultural Development, our determination to fundamentally change the face of the countryside through three years of hard work, our goal to catch up with or surpass England in steel and other major industrial products in about fifteen years, as well as all sorts of magnificent plans, are all part of our great ideal of building a communist society. It commands all our work and promotes all our work. However, in order to turn ideals into vivid reality, deep, meticulous, and solid work is required. Being superficial, rough, and flashy is absolutely incompatible with the style of us Communists. Our style is to have both revolutionary courage and a pragmatic spirit. A true communist must combine lofty ideals with in-depth, meticulous, and solid work.
    The Beijing First Industrial Building Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, after formulating plans and targets, immediately carried out in-depth and meticulous work, leading the masses to realize the plans and targets, and achieved remarkable results. This approach is an example of combining one's ideals with practical work. It is well worth promoting.

### 要有伟大的理想  也要有踏实的工作

    要有伟大的理想  也要有踏实的工作
    我们共产党人要有伟大的理想，也要有实现这种理想的踏实的工作。没有理想，我们的一切工作就会失去动力，而没有踏实的工作，理想也会落空。
    我们要实现农业发展纲要四十条，我们要苦战三年基本改变农村面貌，我们要在十五年左右在钢铁和其他主要工业产品方面赶上或超过英国，以及其他各种各样的宏伟规划，就是我们整个建设共产主义社会的伟大理想的一部分。它统率着我们的一切工作，促进着我们的一切工作。但是，为了把理想变成活生生的现实，这就要作深入的工作，细致的工作，踏实的工作，浮而不深、粗而不细，华而不实，这同我们共产党人的风格绝不相容。我们的风格是既要有革命的胆略，又要有求实的精神。一个真正的共产主义者必须把伟大的理想同深入、细致、踏实的工作结合起来。
    建筑工程部北京第一工业建筑设计院，在制定了规划和指标以后立即进行深入细致的工作，领导群众实现规划和指标，取得显著成效。这种做法，正是把自己的理想和切实的工作结合起来的一例。很值得提倡。
