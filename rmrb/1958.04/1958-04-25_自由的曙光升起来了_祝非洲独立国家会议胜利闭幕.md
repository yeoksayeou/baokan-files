The Conference of Independent African States held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, successfully concluded on April 22. This is the first time in history that African countries have held a conference to discuss issues of common concern without the participation of colonial countries. In addition to the independent states of Ghana, the United Arab Republic, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Liberia, the conference was also attended by representatives of national independence movements from non-independent regions such as Algeria, Cameroon, and Togo. Therefore, all African people have high expectations for this conference, and peace-loving countries and people around the world are concerned about it.

The African continent is currently a region where the struggle between colonialism and anti-colonialism is very sharp. Before World War II, almost all of Africa was colonies and dependent countries, where Western colonialists did whatever they wanted. However, with the development of national independence movements after the war, the face of Africa has also undergone great changes. Especially after the Bandung Asian-African Conference, the national independence movement in Africa has become even more vigorous. Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, and Ghana have successively gained independence. Thus, the area of independent African countries now accounts for 28.5% of the entire continent, and the population accounts for 39.6%. The armed struggles and mass movements against colonialism in other non-independent regions have also reached an unprecedented scale. The long night of the "Dark Continent" has dawned, the dawn of independence and freedom has risen, and the African people have stood up. The Conference of Independent African States was convened under these circumstances.

The Conference of Independent African States reflected the strong desire of the African people to strive for independence and freedom and to safeguard independence and freedom. "No interference in Africa, Africa must be free!" This is the loudest voice from the conference. The declaration adopted by the conference announced that the independent African states are loyal to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration of the Bandung Asian-African Conference, and are determined to "safeguard our hard-won independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity." The declaration calls for "recognition of the right of Africans to independence and self-determination, and the adoption of appropriate steps to accelerate the realization of this right." The conference gave strong support to the struggle of the people in non-independent parts of Africa for independence and adopted a series of resolutions. The resolution on Algeria demands that France recognize the independence and self-determination of the Algerian people, withdraw all its troops from Algeria, and immediately hold peaceful negotiations with the Algerian National Liberation Front. This resolution also calls for "France's friends and allies not to directly or indirectly assist France in its military operations in Algeria." In addition, the just struggles of the people of Togo and Cameroon have also received the attention and support of the conference.

Racism is a manifestation of colonialism. In vast areas of Africa, even today, colonialists are still practicing the most barbaric racial persecution, which is intolerable to all honest people. The resolution of the Conference of Independent African States sternly denounced "the practice of racial discrimination and apartheid as evil and inhuman," condemned "all aspects of racial discrimination and apartheid in various parts of the world, especially in the Union of South Africa, the Federation of Central Africa, Kenya, and other regions of Africa," and "recommended that all participating governments take vigorous measures to eradicate any traces of racial discrimination that may exist within their own countries."

The awakened African people are not only concerned about African affairs but also about the fate of the world. The facts that have occurred in Africa once again prove that the national independence movement against imperialism is a force for peace. As the declaration of the Conference of Independent African States says: "The African people stand on the side of peace." The conference's resolution on international peace and security strongly condemned all atomic tests conducted anywhere in the world, especially the attempt to conduct such tests in the Sahara. The resolution calls on the major powers to cease the production and testing of nuclear weapons and to use atomic energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. These voices from the Conference of Independent African States show that the African people have emerged as a new factor for peace on the international political stage.

In the face of the increasingly collapsing imperialist colonial system, colonialists are trying to turn Africa into their "last line of defense." Therefore, they are very afraid of the unity and awakening of the African people. The colonialists resent the convening of the Conference of Independent African States. As early as last spring, when news of the preparations for the conference had just spread, the United States and other Western colonial countries exerted pressure on many independent African countries in an attempt to prevent the conference from being held. After the conference opened as scheduled, Western newspapers maliciously spread all kinds of provocative remarks to affect the normal progress of the conference. But the colonialists' conspiracies did not succeed. With the support of all African people and all peace-loving and freedom-loving people, the Conference of Independent African States has achieved significant results. Contrary to the colonialists' illusions, this conference marks that, under the common banner of anti-colonialism, African countries are further uniting and advancing along the road of independence and freedom. No matter how the colonialists attempt to obstruct and interfere, the flames of the African people's struggle for independence and freedom will illuminate their broad future. The future of Africa is infinitely bright!

### 自由的曙光升起来了——祝非洲独立国家会议胜利闭幕

    自由的曙光升起来了
    ——祝非洲独立国家会议胜利闭幕
    在加纳首都阿克拉举行的非洲独立国家会议，已于4月22日胜利闭幕。在没有殖民国家参加的情况下，非洲国家举行会议讨论自己所共同关心的问题，这还是历史上第一次。同时，参加这次会议的除了独立国家加纳、阿拉伯联合共和国、利比亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚和利比里亚以外，还有阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆和多哥等尚未获得独立地区的民族独立运动的代表。因此，全非洲人民对这次会议寄予热切的期望，全世界爱好和平的国家和人民也对这次会议表示关心。
    非洲大陆是目前殖民主义和反殖民主义斗争十分尖锐的一个地区。在第二次世界大战以前，整个非洲几乎全部都是殖民地和附属国，西方殖民主义者在那里为所欲为。但是，随着战后民族独立运动的发展，非洲的面貌也发生了很大变化。特别是万隆亚非会议以后，非洲的民族独立运动更加高涨。苏丹、突尼斯、摩洛哥和加纳，相继独立。这样，非洲独立国家的面积已占全非洲的28.5％，人口占全非洲的39.6％。其他未获独立地区的反殖民主义的武装斗争和群众运动，也达到空前的规模。“黑暗大陆”的漫漫长夜已经破晓，独立自由的曙光已经升起，非洲人民站起来了。这次的非洲独立国家会议，就是在这种形势下召开的。
    非洲独立国家会议反映了非洲人民要求争取独立自由和保卫独立自由的强烈愿望。“不要干涉非洲，非洲必须自由！”这就是从会议上发出的最响亮的声音。会议所通过的宣言宣布：非洲独立国家忠于世界人权宣言和万隆亚非会议的宣言，决心“保障我们得来不易的独立、主权和领土完整”。宣言要求“承认非洲人有独立和自决权，并且采取适当步骤加速实现这种权利”。会议对于非洲未独立地方人民争取独立的斗争，给予了有力的支持，并且通过了一系列决议。关于阿尔及利亚的决议，要求法国承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立和自决权，从阿尔及利亚撤出它的全部军队，立即同阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线举行和平谈判。这个决议并且要求“法国的友邦和盟国不要直接或间接地帮助法国在阿尔及利亚的军事行动”。另外，多哥和喀麦隆人民的正义斗争，也受到了会议的重视和支持。
    种族主义是殖民主义的一种表现。在非洲的广大地区，直到今天，殖民者仍然在实行最野蛮的种族迫害，这是一切正直的人民都不能容忍的。非洲独立国家会议的决议严厉地斥责“种族歧视和种族隔离的做法是罪恶和不人道的”，谴责了“世界各地，特别是南非联邦、中非联邦、怯尼亚和非洲其他地区的种族歧视和种族隔离行径的一切方面”，并“建议所有与会国政府采取有力的措施，根除它们自己国内可能出现的种族歧视的痕迹”。
    觉醒了的非洲人民不仅关心非洲的事务，而且关心全世界的命运。非洲所发生的事实又一次证明，反对帝国主义的民族独立运动是一支和平的力量。正像非洲独立国家会议宣言所说：“非洲人民是站在和平一边的”。会议关于国际和平与安全的决议，强烈谴责了在世界任何地方进行的一切原子试验，特别是打算在撒哈拉进行这种试验的企图。决议要求大国停止生产和试验核武器，把原子能专门用于和平目的。非洲独立国家会议所发出的这些声音表明，非洲人民已经作为一个新的和平因素出现在国际政治舞台上。
    在帝国主义殖民体系日益瓦解的形势下，殖民主义者正想把非洲变为他们的“最后防线”。因此他们非常害怕非洲人民的团结和觉醒。殖民主义者对于非洲独立国家会议的召开是怀恨在心的。早在去年春天，准备召开非洲独立国家会议的消息刚刚传出的时候，美国便和其它西方殖民国家一道，对许多非洲独立国家施加压力，想要制止这次会议召开。会议如期开幕以后，西方国家报刊又恶意散布种种挑拨性的言论，影响会议的正常进行。但是殖民者的阴谋活动并未如愿。在全非洲人民以及一切爱好和平与自由人民的支持下，非洲独立国家会议已经获得了重大的成就。和殖民者的幻想恰恰相反，这个会议标志着，在反对殖民主义的共同旗帜下，非洲国家正进一步团结起来，沿着独立自由的道路前进。不管殖民者怎么样妄图进行阻挡和干涉，非洲人民争取独立自由的烽火，将会照亮他们的广阔前途。非洲的未来是无限光明的！
