Relying on the Masses, Small-Scale as the Foundation, Medium-Scale as the Backbone
Thoroughly Harnessing the Rivers of Hebei, Transforming the Landscape
Report by Yan Dakai, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Sha River Basin Conference (Excerpt)
Thoroughly Harnessing the Hai River in Two to Three Years

The central topic of this Sha River conference held in Xingtang is to discuss how to thoroughly harness the Sha River and all rivers within Hebei Province, and transform the landscape of the entire province, starting from the next year, within two to three years or a little longer, based on the principle of "small-scale as the foundation, medium-scale as the backbone."

According to the original plan, thoroughly harnessing the Hai River would take fifteen years. Now we propose to complete the thorough harnessing within two to three years or a little longer. Our basis is the experience of Xingtang County in thoroughly harnessing the Qu River and Gao River, and the Baoding Prefecture in thoroughly harnessing the Tang River. The Qu River and Gao River are tributaries of the Sha River, with the Gao River being the largest tributary. These two rivers run through the entire Xingtang County, causing great harm to the mountainous and plain areas. Usually, there is no water in the river, causing wind and sand hazards and drought; during the flood season, floods erupt, destroying fields and land. Changing this situation is the most urgent desire of the vast masses in the mountainous and plain areas. In the water conservancy construction campaign last winter and this spring, the masses in Xingtang County, under the leadership of the county party committee, found this approach. In order to develop irrigation in the mountainous and plain areas, they planned to build 1,000 small reservoirs in the 600-plus square kilometer basin area of the Qu River and Gao River. More than 400 have already been completed or are about to be completed, and 600 are expected to be completed before the flood season this year, with an estimated water storage capacity of over 10 million cubic meters. On this basis, eight medium-sized reservoirs will be built. After all these reservoirs are completed, they can store nearly 200 million cubic meters of water. This will control almost all of the considerable floods. The Red Scarf medium-sized reservoir currently under construction on the Qu River can store 40 million cubic meters of water, which can basically control the Qu River. The Koutou reservoir to be built on the Gao River (to be completed before the flood season next year) has a storage capacity of nearly 100 million cubic meters, which, together with other projects, can also basically control the Gao River. This will not only solve flood disasters and develop irrigation on a large scale but also generate electricity and achieve preliminary electrification within a certain range.

The experience of Baoding Prefecture in thoroughly harnessing the Tang River is similar. The Tang River is a major tributary of the Daqing River system, second only to the Zhulong River and Juma River. In 1956, the maximum flow rate was more than 1,900 cubic meters per second. The masses are planning to build 40 medium-sized reservoirs on this river, plus other projects in the mountainous and plain areas, which can be fully controlled this winter and next spring. In terms of labor, it is a cooperation between the plains and the mountains. This cooperation is not only within the county but also between counties. Most of the 29 medium-sized reservoirs already under construction in Baoding Prefecture are the result of cooperation between the plains and mountains. Based on small-scale projects, the plains and mountains cooperate to build medium-sized reservoirs on a large scale. This is a great initiative by the broad masses in socialist construction to build mountains and harness rivers, develop mountainous areas, and transform plains, opening up a new path for us to thoroughly harness the Hai River. Not only the Qu River, Gao River, and Tang River can be thoroughly harnessed, but also the Cao, Pu, Fu, Jie, Ping, Mengliang River, and Beiyishui rivers in the Daqing River basin will be completely or mostly controlled before this year's flood season or in this winter and next spring. Similarly, many tributaries in other basins have been controlled or are about to be controlled. This is precisely the result of the widespread flowering of the experience of thoroughly harnessing the Mang River in our province. Based on these experiences, the Sha River-Zhulong River, the southern branch of the Daqing River, can be basically thoroughly harnessed in this winter and next spring, plus the winter and spring after next, or a little longer. The Juma River, the northern branch of the Daqing River, can also be solved in this way. Once the Zhulong River and Juma River are solved, the Tang River, Jie River, Fu River, Cao River, Pu River, Zhongyishui River, and Beiyishui River among them will also be solved, and the Daqing River, one of the five major tributaries of the Hai River, will be basically solved. The method is to first cut off the limbs and break the tributaries. Such a relatively complex river system as the Daqing River can be solved in this way. The Hutuo River, Fuyang River, Yongding River, Chaobai River, and Jiyun River can all be solved by adopting this method. The Luan River should also mobilize the masses to first cut off the tributaries, use the water on the tributaries to develop irrigation and power generation, and carry out mountainous area construction.

Divide and Govern, Unite and Govern

Implement river-system-based contract governance. Adopt the method of "divide and govern" and "unite and govern." Each major river is governed by various prefectures through division of labor and cooperation.

The Daqing River is mainly the responsibility of Baoding Prefecture, supplemented by Tianjin and Shijiazhuang Prefectures, to jointly carry out thorough harnessing.

The Hutuo River is mainly the responsibility of Shijiazhuang Prefecture, supplemented by Cangxian Prefecture, and in cooperation with Shanxi Province, to carry out thorough harnessing.

The Fuyang River and Zhang River are mainly the responsibility of Xingtai and Handan Prefectures, supplemented by Shijiazhuang and Cangxian Prefectures, and in cooperation with Shanxi Province (Zhang River) to carry out thorough harnessing.

The upper reaches of the Yongding River, the Sanggan River and Yang River, are the responsibility of Zhangjiakou Prefecture, in cooperation with Shanxi and Inner Mongolia.

The Jiyun River is the responsibility of Tangshan Prefecture, in cooperation with Tianjin Prefecture.

The tributaries of the Luan River are the responsibility of Tangshan Prefecture and Chengde Prefecture, respectively.

The governance of the upper reaches of the Chaobai River is the responsibility of Zhangjiakou and Chengde Prefectures, respectively.

In addition, the Miyun Reservoir is being built in cooperation with the capital on the Chaobai River.

The general governance policy is: Rely on the masses, proceed from production, with small-scale as the foundation, medium-scale as the backbone, supplemented by necessary minor large-scale projects. Small reservoirs are the foundation, and medium-sized reservoirs are the backbone. This has developed on the basis of "small-scale as the main, medium-scale as the auxiliary." Experience has shown that small reservoirs are the foundation for changing the face of agricultural production in mountainous areas. According to the experience of Xingtang, relying on small reservoirs can quickly and effectively develop farmland water conservancy in mountainous areas, promote the terracing of slopes in mountainous areas, and make terraces water-conserving, creating favorable conditions for soil and water conservation and afforestation in mountainous areas. Therefore, we must not relax the construction of small reservoirs by the broad masses. The backbone role of medium-sized reservoirs is mainly to solve problems that small reservoirs cannot solve. It can completely change the face of a river or a basin. For example, the basin area above the Red Scarf Reservoir on the Qu River is 67.5 square kilometers. A heavy rainfall of 183 mm can produce a total runoff of 8.64 million cubic meters. The 100 small reservoirs that have been built and are planned to be built in this basin can only store 790,000 cubic meters, and the remaining 90% of the water will still run off. However, after the completion of the Red Scarf medium-sized reservoir, it can store about 40 million cubic meters of water, which can completely intercept the water from above, irrigate hundreds of thousands of mu of land in the hilly and plain areas, and install several hundred kilowatts of power generation equipment. Another example is the Gao River. The runoff from a once-in-a-century rainstorm in the 142-square-kilometer basin area above Koutou Village is 18 million cubic meters. After all 205 small reservoirs in this basin are completed, they can store 1.18 million cubic meters of water, accounting for only 6.5% of the total water volume. After the Koutou Reservoir is completed, it will have more than enough capacity to store all the floodwater, and its irrigation and power generation capacity will be greater than that of the Red Scarf Reservoir. In this way, the nature and situation of these two rivers will be completely changed. With the in-depth development of the mass water conservancy construction campaign, the construction of medium-sized reservoirs has become an urgent demand of the broad masses in mountainous and plain areas. There are now more than 70 medium-sized reservoirs under construction and preparing for construction throughout the province, which shows that the conditions for large-scale medium-sized projects have matured. It also shows that taking small reservoirs as the foundation and medium-sized reservoirs as the backbone has become an effective policy for the broad masses in our province to work on their own, promote benefits and eliminate harm, and manage mountains and rivers. Of course, a few necessary large-scale projects should still be carried out so that they can better play a comprehensive utilization role on the basis of medium and small-scale projects. Moreover, these projects can also be undertaken in cooperation with the masses.

Store Water in the Mountains

Regarding the guiding ideology for building reservoirs:

Building reservoirs is not just for flood control, but more importantly for storing water to serve the production and life of the masses. Therefore, as long as conditions permit, we should store as much water as possible to develop irrigation and power generation. Judging from the total water volume of our province, it is not too much, but too little. We must do everything possible to store water in order to develop irrigation on a large scale and achieve water conservancy throughout the province.

We should try to store water in the mountainous areas as much as possible, so that reservoir construction can be combined with mountainous area construction and plain transformation. Storing a large amount of water in the mountainous areas can, on the one hand, develop production in the mountainous areas, and on the other hand, eliminate floods in the plains and develop large-scale irrigation in the plains. At the same time, because mountainous reservoirs are surrounded by mountains on three sides, they occupy less land and store more water, so they are the most economical. The storage capacity of medium-sized reservoirs should be as large as possible, depending on the possibilities. When calculating the storage capacity, we should not only calculate the rainfall and runoff in the upstream basin area, but also have sufficient estimates for base flow and underground undercurrents, and strive to achieve annual regulation if conditions permit.

Small reservoirs are built by the masses themselves, and medium-sized reservoirs are also mainly built by the masses. After cooperativization, especially after the socialist education movement and the nationwide rectification, the enthusiasm of the broad masses is extremely high. As long as we fully believe in the socialist consciousness and strength of the broad masses and unswervingly rely on the masses, we can achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.

Cooperation Between Plains and Mountains

Promote the spirit of cooperation between the plains and mountains, and mobilize the plains to support the mountains. Mountainous and plain areas are a unified entity in socialist construction, and building mountainous areas and transforming plains are inseparable. Cooperation between the plains and mountains to jointly build mountainous areas is not only beneficial to the mountainous areas but also benefits the plains. Storing water in the mountains has great benefits for the plains: First, it can greatly reduce flood disasters in the plains. In the past eight or nine years, the province has cumulatively flooded more than 180 million mu of land, collapsed millions of houses, and suffered huge losses of various property. After the construction of reservoirs in the mountainous areas, this situation will change, which is a great guarantee for the production and life of the masses in the plains. Second, it can greatly reduce the heavy burden of spring work and flood prevention. In the past, every year's spring work and flood prevention took up hundreds of thousands or millions of laborers. During the flood season in 1956, the number of people protecting dams and carrying out rescue work on various rivers reached 1.5 million, while also consuming huge amounts of financial and material resources. After the construction of reservoirs in the mountainous areas, a large number of laborers and financial and material resources can be freed up and invested in production. Third, it can also develop large-scale irrigation in the plains, and many lands can achieve gravity irrigation. At the same time, storing water in the mountainous areas will greatly increase the underground water source in the plains, which provides sufficient water for the well irrigation areas in the plains and can irrigate saline-alkali areas by connecting the irrigation networks in the mountainous and plain areas. Fourth, it can free up a large amount of river channel land and expand the cultivated area. Fifth, water storage in the mountainous areas can generate a large amount of electricity, which can be used not only in the mountainous areas but also to supply electricity to the plains and help the plains achieve electrification. Therefore, our slogan is: The plains and mountains cooperate to build mountainous areas and transform plains. We must deeply publicize this truth to the broad masses and mobilize the people of the whole province to work hard for two or three years to change the face of the rivers and mountains.

The plains should actively store water and establish irrigation systems. In the plain areas bordering the mountainous areas, we should adopt the practice of Shijiazhuang Prefecture to turn the Shijin Canal into an irrigation canal, so that mountainous reservoirs can be combined with plain canal networks. In low-lying areas, we should resolutely promote the experience of Tianjin and Cangxian Prefectures in transforming low-lying areas and storing water to grow rice. Ningjinpo, Daluzawa, Qianqingwa, and other large and small depressions can be done in this way. In this way, we can fully utilize the drained water and floodwater to change the face of production. Counties in semi-mountainous and semi-plain areas should resolutely promote Xushui's experience in building plain reservoirs and carrying out mountainous area projects to manage mountains and rivers, so that the drained water and mountain water of the county do not leave the county and are fully utilized. Pure plain counties should vigorously promote Jing County's experience, using all pits, ponds, depressions, and plain reservoirs to store all the water within the county and develop irrigation as much as possible by diverting and storing river water.

Irrigation and Cultivation Should be Gardened

Irrigation and cultivation should be gardened. Irrigation and cultivation in the plains should be gardened, and slopes in the mountainous areas should be terraced, and terraces should also be gardened. This is a fundamental issue in the agricultural technology reform in our province with the water conservancy movement. Gardening is not only an irrigation issue but mainly intensive cultivation. With water conservancy conditions, not working carefully cannot significantly increase production. Therefore, with the development of water conservancy irrigation, we must resolutely and vigorously improve irrigation methods and cultivation techniques. All plains and mountainous cultivated land with water conservancy conditions should be irrigated and cultivated according to the standards of old farmers' garden management. We require that more than 70% of the cultivated land in the province with water conservancy conditions achieve gardening this year, and all areas with a foundation should achieve full gardening; the province should basically achieve gardening in two or three years. Only in this way can we greatly increase production and achieve "four, five, eight" ahead of schedule.

Make Good Plans and Strengthen Leadership

Make good plans and strengthen leadership. All localities should make their plans as soon as possible and make all necessary preparations. First of all, the projects to be done this winter and next spring should complete the survey and design before autumn so that construction can start in a timely manner after autumn. We require that the water conservancy upsurge this winter and next spring be earlier, more energetic, and larger in scale than last year. All local committees and county committees should establish strong command posts. Command posts should also be established at all construction sites. Leading comrades in charge of this work must study hard and diligently. We will encounter many difficulties, but as long as we can mobilize all positive factors and fully mobilize the masses, it is entirely possible to thoroughly harness the rivers of our province and change the face of the rivers and mountains of the entire province in two or three years or a little longer.

    依靠群众，小型为基础，中型为骨干
    根治河北各河流，改变河山面貌
    中共河北省委书记阎达开在沙河流域会议上的报告（摘要）
    两、三年内根治海河
    这次在行唐召开的沙河会议，中心议题是讨论如何根据“以小型为基础，以中型为骨干”的方针，从下一个年度开始，在两、三年内或者再多一点时间，根治沙河和我省境内各个河流，改变全省的河山面貌。
    按照原来的规划，根治海河需要十五年。现在我们提出要在两、三年内或者再多一点时间，完成根治。我们的根据就是行唐县根治曲河、郜河和保定专区根治唐河的经验。曲河、郜河是沙河的支流，郜河还是最大的一条支流。这两条河流贯穿行唐县全境，对山区、平原为害很大。平时河里没水，风沙为害，土地干旱；汛期，洪水暴发，毁田冲地。改变这种局面，是山区、平原广大群众最迫切的愿望。在去冬今春的水利建设运动中，行唐县的群众在县委的领导下，找到了这个门径。他们为了发展山区和平原的灌溉，在曲河和郜河的六百多平方公里的流域面积上，计划修建一千座小水库，现在已经完成和即将完成四百多座，今年汛前可完成六百座，估计蓄水可达一千多万公方。并在这个基础上，修建中型水库八座。这些水库全部建成后，可蓄水近两亿公方。这样就把相当大的洪水差不多全部控制起来了。曲河上正在修建的红领巾中型水库，能蓄水四千万公方，可以把曲河基本上控制起来；在郜河上准备修建的口头水库（明年汛前完成），蓄水近一亿公方，再加上其他工程，也可以把郜河基本上控制起来。这样，不仅可以解决洪水灾害和大规模地发展灌溉，还可以发电，在一定的范围内实现初步电气化。
    保定专区根治唐河的经验也是这样。唐河是大清河系仅次于潴龙河、拒马河的一条大支流。1956年最大流量是一千九百多秒公方，群众要在这条河上修建四十座中型水库，加上山区和平原的其他工程，今冬明春可以把它全部控制起来。在劳力方面，是平原与山区合作，共同进行。这种合作，不仅是本县范围之内的合作，而且是县与县的合作。保定专区已经动工的二十九座中型水库，多数都是平原、山区合作。在小型基础上，平原与山区合作，大搞中型水库。这是广大群众在社会主义建设中，对于治山治河建设山区、改变平原的一个伟大的创举，给我们根治海河开辟了一条新的途径。不只是曲河、郜河、唐河可以被根治的，就在今年汛期以前或在今冬明春，大清河流域的漕、瀑、府、界、萍、孟良河、北易水等河流，都将要全部或大部被控制起来，其他流域同样也有不少的支流已被控制或即将被控制。这正是根治漭河的经验在我省普遍开花的结果。根据这些经验，大清河的南支沙河——潴龙河是完全可以在今冬明春加上明冬后春或者再多一点时间基本上达到根治的。大清河的北支拒马河也可以这样解决。潴龙河、拒马河解决了，它们当中的唐河、界河、府河、漕河、瀑河、中易水、北易水等也解决了，海河五大干流之一的大清河就基本上解决了。办法是先砍膀子，斩断支流。大清河这样一个比较复杂的河系可以这样解决。滹沱河、滏阳河、永定河、潮白河、蓟运河都可以采取这个办法解决。滦河也要发动群众先砍断支流，利用支流上的水利发展灌溉和发电，进行山区建设。
        分而治之，合而治之
    按河系包干治理。采取“分而治之”、“合而治之”的办法，各大河流都由各个专区分工、合作负责治理。
    大清河以保定专区为主，天津、石家庄专区为辅，共同合作进行根治；
    滹沱河以石家庄专区为主，沧县专区为辅，与山西协作，进行根治；
    滏阳河、漳河以邢台、邯郸专区为主，石家庄、沧县专区为辅，并与山西协作（漳河）进行根治。
    永定河上游桑干河、洋河，由张家口专区负责，同山西、内蒙古协作；
    蓟运河由唐山专区负责，与天津专区合作；
    滦河支流由唐山专区和承德专区分别负责；
    潮白河上游的治理，由张家口、承德专区分别负责。
    另外，在潮白河与首都合作修建密云水库。
    总的治理方针是：依靠群众，从生产出发，以小型为基础，以中型为骨干，辅之必要的少数大型工程。小型水库为基础，中型水库为骨干，是在“小型为主，中型为辅”的基础上发展起来的。经验证明小型水库是改变山区农业生产面貌的基础。根据行唐的经验，以小型水库为基础，能够迅速有效地发展山区的农田水利，促进山区的坡地梯田化，梯田达到水利化，并为山区的水土保持、绿化创造了有利条件。因此决不能放松了修建广大群众性的小水库。中型水库的骨干作用主要是解决小水库所不能解决的问题，它能彻底改变一条河流、一个流域的面貌。例如曲河，红领巾水库以上的流域面积是六十七点五平方公里，一次一百八十三公厘的暴雨，可产生径流总量八百六十四万公方，在这个流域范围内已经建成和准备修建的一百座小水库仅能容蓄七十九万公方，其余90％的水还是要跑掉的。但是，红领巾中型水库建成后，可以蓄水四千万公方左右，上边下来的水能够全部拦蓄，可以灌溉丘陵区和平原区几十万亩土地，还可安装几百瓩的发电设备。又如郜河，口头村以上一百四十二平方公里的流域面积，百年一遇暴雨径流量是一千八百万公方，这个流域内的二百零五座小水库全部建成后，能蓄水一百一十八万公方，仅占总水量的6.5％，口头水库建成以后，容蓄全部洪水是绰绰有余，灌溉、发电的能力比红领巾水库还要大。这样这两条河的性质和局面就完全改变了。随着广大群众性的水利建设运动的深入发展，修建中型水库已经成为广大山区群众和平原群众的迫切要求。现在全省正在动工和准备动工的中型水库有七十多座，这说明大搞中型的条件已经成熟。同时也说明了，以小型水库为基础，以中型水库为骨干，已经成为我省广大群众自己动手、兴利除害、治山治河的一条行之有效的方针了。当然，少数必要的大型工程还是要作的，以便在中、小型的基础上更能发挥综合利用的作用。并且这些工程也可以与群众合作兴办。
          把水蓄在山上
    关于修建水库的指导思想问题：
    修建水库不只是为了拦洪，更重要的是为了把水蓄起来，为群众的生产、生活服务。因此，只要条件允许，就尽量多蓄水，用以发展灌溉和发电。从我们全省的总水量来看，不是多了，而是太少。我们必须千方百计把水蓄住，才能大规模的发展灌溉，实现全省水利化。
    要尽可能把山区的水蓄在山区，使建库与建设山区、改变平原相结合。把水大量蓄在山区，一方面可以发展山区生产，另一方面可以免除平原的水患和大规模的开展平原灌溉。同时，由于山区水库是三山环抱，占地少，蓄水多，所以是最经济的。中型水库的库容，应该根据可能，尽量多蓄水。在计算库容时，不光计算上游流域面积的雨量和径流，对基流、地下潜流也要有足够的估计，并且有条件的尽量做到年度调节。
    小型水库依靠群众自办，中型也主要是依靠群众办。在合作化以后，特别是经过社会主义教育运动和全民整风，广大群众的干劲十足。只要我们充分相信广大群众建设社会主义的觉悟和力量，坚定不移地依靠群众，就能够做到多、快、好、省。
          平原与山区合作
    发扬平原与山区合作的精神，发动平原支援山区。山区、平原是社会主义建设的统一体，建设山区和改变平原是密不可分的。平原与山区合作，共同建设山区，不只是有利山区，而且造福平原。把水蓄在山区，对平原有很大的好处：第一、可以大大免除平原洪水灾害。过去八、九年来，全省累计淹地达一亿八千多万亩，倒塌房屋数百万间，各种财物损失甚巨。山区建库以后，这种局面就改变了，这对平原群众的生产、生活是一个很大的保障。第二、可以大大免除春工、防汛的沉重负担。过去每年春工、防汛，要占去数十万、上百万的劳力，1956年汛期在各个河流上护堤、抢险曾达到一百五十万人，同时还要耗费巨大的财力和物力。山区建库以后，则可以腾出大批劳力和财力、物力投入生产。第三、还可以大规模发展平原灌溉，而且很多土地能够做到自流灌溉。同时，由于在山区建库蓄水，就会大大增加平原的地下水源，这就为平原井灌区提供了充足的水量，并可通过沟通山区、平原的灌溉网，引水灌溉盐碱地区。第四、可以腾出大量的河道占地，扩大耕地面积。第五、山区蓄水可以大量发电，除用于山区外，并能向平原供电，帮助平原实现电气化。因此，我们的口号是：平原与山区合作，建设山区，改变平原。我们必须向广大群众深入地宣传这个道理，动员全省人民苦干二、三年，改变河山面貌。
    平原要积极蓄水，建立灌溉系统。在和山区接壤的平原地区，要采取石家庄专区把石津运河变为灌溉渠的作法，使山区水库和平原渠道网结合起来。在低洼地区，要坚决推广天津、沧县专区洼地改造和蓄水种稻的经验，宁晋泊、大陆泽、千顷洼及其他大小洼淀，都可以这样作。这样就可以把沥水、洪水充分利用起来改变生产面貌。半山区、半平原的县，要坚决推广徐水修建平原水库和山区工程治山治河的经验，作到本县的沥水和本县的山水不出县，并加以充分利用。纯平原的县要大力推广景县的经验，利用一切坑塘、洼淀和平原水库把境内的水全部蓄起来，并尽可能的引蓄河水发展灌溉。
        灌溉耕作园田化
    灌溉、耕作园田化。平原灌溉、耕作要园田化，山区坡地要梯田化，梯田也要园田化。这是我省随着水利化运动，在农业技术改革中一个带有根本性的问题。园田化不仅是灌溉问题，而主要是精耕细作。有了水利条件，不认真的细作，并不能够显著增产。因此随着水利灌溉的发展，必须坚决地、大力地改进灌溉方法和耕作技术。凡有水利条件的平原和山区耕地，都要按照原来老农经营园田的规格来灌溉和耕作粮田。要求全省有水利条件的耕地，在今年有70％以上达到园田化，有基础的地区要全部园田化；在二、三年内全省基本上实现园田化。只有这样，才能大量增产，提前实现“四、五、八”。
      作好规划，加强领导
    做好规划，加强领导。各地要尽快的把规划做好，并做好一切必要的准备。首先是今冬明春要做的工程，要在秋前完成勘查设计，以便秋后及时动工。要求今冬明春的水利高潮，比去年更提早，劲头更足，规模更大。各地委、县委，都要建立起强有力的指挥部。各个工地也要建立起指挥部。主管这项工作的领导同志们，必须苦学苦钻。我们会碰到很多困难的，但只要能把一切积极因素调动起来，把群众充分发动起来，在两、三年内或者再多一点时间根治我省各河，改变全省的河山面貌，是完全可能的。
