    In Newspapers Across Regions
    Does Individualism Have a Positive Role?
    Recently, fourth-year students and faculty members of the Trade Department of Renmin University of China launched a debate on whether individualism has a positive role. There were roughly three different viewpoints in the debate: some people believed that individualism has a positive role and is a driving force for people to move forward; some people believed that individualism has a positive role under certain conditions (i.e., when personal interests are consistent with collective interests); and some people believed that individualism is not a driving force, but an obstacle. How to understand and treat individualism is a problem of universal significance. On the 23rd, the Beijing Daily opened a special column and published the three opinions from the debate, deciding to launch a thought discussion in the newspaper.
    "Treasure Trove"
    On the 23rd, the Dazhong Daily introduced a good method for realizing water conservancy in the plains area—digging "dual-purpose reservoirs on flat land." Farmers in Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, dug a kind of "dual-purpose reservoir" in water conservancy construction, which can both draw groundwater for current use and store rainwater for long-term use. These reservoirs are mainly dug by using old river courses, bays, pits, and old channels, which saves labor, land, and money, and the irrigation efficiency is high and the quality is good, so the local people call them "treasure troves." This has opened up new avenues for accelerating water conservancy in the plains area, especially in areas with few rivers and no conditions for gravity irrigation. Recently, the Shandong Provincial Spring Production Inspection Team held an on-site meeting in Pingyuan County to promote this experience.
    No More Kneeling and Weeding
    Technical revolution can not only greatly improve production efficiency, but also liberate workers from heavy labor. On the 20th, the Jiangxi Daily published an exciting message. The message said that the vast number of farmers in Nanchang County had been producing in a backward way of "kneeling and weeding" for generations, with low efficiency and hard labor. Farmers describe their labor as: "Facing the yellow soil with their backs to the sky, so tired that white smoke comes out of their mouths." When weeding two or three times, the rice leaves cut their legs and bleed. Now, they are carrying out technical reforms, and heavy labor will be replaced by various weeding tools. The newspaper also published an editorial on this, commenting on the great significance of this weeding toolization.
    Novelty in the Catering Industry
    "The catering industry in Jianyang Chengguan has achieved self-sufficiency in pork this year." This is a piece of marginal news published on the front page of the Fujian Daily on the 17th. The news said that the employees of state-owned canteens and joint state-private catering stores in Jianyang Chengguan have given play to their creative spirit in the face of reduced raw material supply and streamlined personnel, producing on their own. It is planned to raise 400 pigs, 50 sheep, and 500 fish this year, and cultivate 20 mu of wasteland to plant sweet potatoes and various vegetables, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in pork in the fourth quarter of this year. A production team has been formed, with more than 170 pigs already raised and a lot of wasteland cultivated with vegetables. The newspaper also published a short commentary to accompany it, calling it a pioneering undertaking by catering industry employees.
    Strengthening Theoretical Work
    The Shaanxi Daily published on the 19th the provincial party committee's instructions on "strengthening the theoretical work force," requiring the cultivation of a theoretical team of 2,000 people who are both red and expert within five years. Each theoretical worker with research ability should study at least one issue each year, write an article and investigation report, and each theoretical work unit must be linked to a factory or agricultural cooperative. Party committees at all levels should designate a secretary or standing committee member to manage this work. A theoretical publication will be founded before August this year.
    The Shanxi Daily also published the provincial party committee's instructions on strengthening theoretical work and founding a theoretical publication on the 22nd, and published an editorial.

专栏：

    在各地报纸上
    个人主义有没有积极作用？
    最近，中国人民大学贸易系四年级同学和教职员一起，展开一次关于个人主义有没有积极作用的辩论。辩论中大体上有三种不同的看法：一部分人认为，个人主义有积极作用，是推动人们前进的动力；一部分人认为个人主义在一定条件下（即个人利益和集体利益一致的时候）有积极作用；一部分人认为个人主义不是什么前进的动力，而是阻力。对个人主义如何认识，如何对待，是一个有普遍意义的问题。23日北京日报辟了专栏，发表了辩论中的三种意见，决定在报纸上开展一次思想讨论。
    “宝贝库”
    23日大众日报介绍了平原地区实现水利化的一个好办法——挖“平地两用水库”。山东平原县农民在水利建设中挖了一种“两用水库”，既能取地下水供目前利用，又能蓄雨季水备长远使用。这种水库主要是利用旧河道、湾、坑及旧渠道挖成的，挖起来省工、省地、省钱，浇起地来效能高、质量好，当地群众称之为“宝贝库”。这给平原地区特别是河流少和没有条件自流灌溉地区加速水利化，开辟了新的门路。最近山东省春季生产检查团在平原县召开了现场会议，推广这项经验。
  不再脚跪手耘了
    技术革命不仅可以大大提高生产效率，还可以使劳动者从笨重的劳动中解放出来。20日江西日报发表了一条令人兴奋的消息。消息说南昌县广大农民，世世代代都是以“脚跪手耘”的落后方式进行生产，效率低劳动也很苦。农民形容他们劳动时是：“面朝黄土背朝天，累得嘴里冒白烟”。耘二、三道禾时，稻叶划得满腿流血。现在，他们正在进行技术改革，沉重的劳动将要为各种耘禾工具代替了。该报为此特发表了社论，评述这种耘禾工具化的重大意义。
  饮食业中的新鲜事
    “建阳城关饮食业今年做到猪肉自给”。这是17日福建日报一版登的一条花边新闻。消息说建阳城关国营食堂、公私合营饮食店的职工，在减少原料供应、精简人员的情况下发挥创造精神，自己动手生产，预定今年养猪四百头，羊五十头、鱼五百尾，开垦荒地二十亩，种植番薯和各种蔬菜，争取今年第四季度内达到猪肉自给。现已组成生产队，已养猪一百七十多头，开了不少荒地种上蔬菜。报纸并配合发了短评，称之为饮食业职工的创举。
    加强理论工作
    陕西日报19日刊载了省委关于“加强理论工作队伍”的指示，要求在五年内培养一支两千人的又红又专的理论队伍。每个有研究能力的理论工作者，至少每年研究一个问题，写出一篇文章和调查报告，每个理论工作单位都必须联系一个工厂或农业社。各级党委应确定一名书记或常委管理此项工作。今年8月以前创办一个理论刊物。
    山西日报22日也刊登了省委加强理论工作、创办理论刊物的指示，并发表了社论。
