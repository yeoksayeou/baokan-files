    Serious Situation in Southern Lebanon
    Mass Demonstration in Baghdad

    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, April 5th: News reaching here in the past few days indicates that the situation in southern Lebanon is very serious, especially after the riots in Tyre on April 2nd.

    During the riots in Tyre, gendarmes and police opened fire on demonstrating crowds, killing five people and wounding twelve. Many others were arrested. Among those killed were women and a thirteen-year-old child.

    Tyre residents launched a strike and demonstration on March 28th, after Lebanese authorities arrested five residents at the end of March on unfounded charges of "insulting the national flag." The strike movement in Tyre is continuing.

    It is reported that some Lebanese cities, such as Tripoli in the north and Saida and Nabatieh in the south, held strikes this week to express solidarity with the residents of Tyre.

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 5th: According to a report relayed to Beirut late on the 4th by the Middle East News Agency, a large-scale demonstration against the Iraqi government took place in Baghdad on the 3rd. Demonstrators marched in the streets, chanting "Down with the Iraqi government" and "Down with imperialism." Police opened fire to disperse the demonstrators. Some people were injured, and many were arrested.
