    Golden Monkey
    Yang Zhiyìn
    In the primitive forests of Dianba Township, Wenxian County, Gansu Province, there lives a rare animal in the world—the golden monkey. The golden monkey is also known as the golden snub-nosed monkey or the snub-nosed monkey. It is tall, standing over four feet high, with a tail nearly three feet long; it is agile and nimble. It is also more beautiful than ordinary monkeys: its eyes are surrounded by bare skin, its face is gray-blue, the fur on its head and neck is reddish, the fur on its abdomen is milky yellow, and the outside of its back, tail, and limbs are blackish-yellow. Its fur is up to six inches long, and shines with golden light in the sun. This is how the "golden monkey" got its name. Its nose is also very peculiar: its nostrils point upwards and have two small points; whenever it rains, it has to use its tail or paws to cover its nostrils, hence it is also known as the snub-nosed monkey. The golden monkey belongs to the primate family, living year-round on tall trees above 3,000 meters in the high mountains, never coming down to the ground. When drinking water, they grab each other's tails and hang down from the trees in turns to drink. When they encounter large trees they cannot jump across, they hook their feet together to form a chain and swing across. It is very difficult to catch.
    The golden monkey is very clever. If hunters cannot hit it, it will sit on the treetop, cover its face, and mock the hunters. However, when it is forced into a dead end by hunters, it will cry and weep, hoping to win sympathy. If it is a female monkey, it will point to her breasts, indicating that she has a baby, begging you not to hit her. If you still insist on hitting her, she will feed the baby monkey until it is full, let the baby go, and then lie down for you to hit.
    The golden monkey has high economic value. Making mattresses or fur coats from its skin can prevent and treat rheumatism, making it most suitable for the elderly and people with rheumatism. The golden monkey loves its tail very much. In ancient times, people often used poisoned arrows to shoot and kill them, taking their tails to make saddle blankets and bedding. In the book "Pi Ya" written by Lu Dian, it was said: "The snub-nosed monkey loves its tail very much. If it is hit by a poisoned arrow, it will gnaw off its tail to suppress the poison, fearing it will become a deep affliction." The bones of the golden monkey are called snub-nosed monkey bones, which are valuable medicinal materials. The meat can be eaten and has high nutritional value.
    The golden monkey is only found in Yunnan, Sichuan, Xikang, and the Qinling Mountains in China. Dianba Township in Wenxian County, Gansu Province, is close to Sichuan, located at the foot of the Motianling Mountains, with dense forests and a warm climate. Every winter, golden monkeys come in groups. At this time, local farmers carry dry food and go into the forest to search. Once they find them, they gather all the villagers to surround the mountain, each holding sticks and shouting loudly, preventing them from escaping the encirclement. Because the trees are tall and the monkeys are cunning, in the past, they could only beat them to death, rarely catching them alive. Recently, the farmers of Dianba Township in Wenxian County have, in accordance with the requirements of the Agricultural Development Program for "protecting and developing economically valuable wild animals," made plans to domesticate golden monkeys. They plan to establish a breeding farm with one hundred golden monkeys this year, and develop it to three thousand by 1967. After the plan was made, the enthusiasm of the masses for catching golden monkeys is very high. (Attached image)

    金丝猴
    杨志印
    在甘肃省文县店坝乡的原始森林里，有一种世界上罕见的奇兽——金丝猴。金丝猴又名金线狨或狨。它身躯高大，站起来有四尺多高，尾近三尺长；矫健敏捷。它也比一般猴好看：眼睛周围没毛，脸部灰蓝色，头上和颈上毛色发红，腹部毛奶黄色，背、尾和四肢的外侧是黑黄色，毛长达六寸左右，阳光一照，闪闪发出金光。“金丝猴”即因此得名。它的鼻子也很奇特：鼻孔向上仰，并有两个小尖；每逢下雨，就得用尾或爪来掩盖鼻孔，故又名仰鼻猴。金丝猴是属于灵长类的动物，终年生活在三千公尺以上的高山的大树上，从不下地；喝水时，一个抓着一个尾巴，从树上吊下来轮流着喝。遇到跳不过去的大树，它们便脚拉着脚吊成一串甩过去。很难于捕获。
    金丝猴很机灵，假使猎人打不住它，它会坐在树顶上扣着脸讥笑猎人；但是，当它被猎人逼到路穷途尽时，又会向人哭哭啼啼，希图博取同情。假如是母猴，它还会指着自己的奶，表示它有儿子，求你不要打它；如果你仍然要打，它就会给小猴子把奶喂饱，放走小猴，自己躺下来让你打。
    金丝猴的经济价值很高，用它的皮做成褥子或皮衣，可以防治风湿病，最适宜于老年人和有风湿病的人穿。金丝猴很爱它的尾巴，古代人多用药矢射杀，取尾做鞍被、卧褥。在陆佃所著的“埤雅”一书中曾说：“狨甚爱其尾，中矢毒即自啮其尾以抑之，恶其为深患也”。金丝猴的骨叫狨骨，是名贵的药材，肉可以吃，且营养价值很高。
    金丝猴只产于我国的云南、四川、西康和秦岭一带，甘肃省文县店坝乡靠近四川，位于摩天岭下，森林茂密，气候温暖，每到寒冬，金丝猴结群而来。这时，当地农民就背上干粮，到森林里去踏踩，发现后，便集合全村农民包围山头，个个手持棍棒，高声呐喊，使它不敢逃出包围圈。由于树高，猴又狡猾，在已往，只有往死里打，很少能捉到活的。最近，文县店坝乡农民，已根据农业发展纲要里提出的“保护和发展有经济价值的野生动物”这一要求，作出了驯养金丝猴的规划，计划今年建立一个有一百只金丝猴的驯养场，到1967年发展到三千只。规划订出以后，群众捕捉金丝猴的情绪很高。（附图片）
