Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd: Romanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Chivu Stoica and Vice-Chairman Emil Bodnăraș, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, visited the big-character posters at the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry this evening.

The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has put up 520,000 big-character posters in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign. When the distinguished guests visited here today, they saw a dazzling array of big-character posters from the first floor to the fifth floor of the ministry's office building. Some corridors were almost blocked by the big-character posters, and the distinguished guests had to squeeze through the thicket of posters.

The distinguished guests listened with great interest to the introduction by Lü Dong, Vice-Minister of Metallurgical Industry, about the big-character posters exposing and criticizing various shortcomings in the ministry. Chairman Chivu Stoica also asked Lü Dong many questions about the big-character posters. Lü Dong told the distinguished guests that the big-character poster is a form of socialist democracy created by the masses, and it really solves big problems. After in-depth exposure and extensive debate by the broad masses, if the waste in the First Five-Year Plan can be gradually overcome, the construction speed of China's metallurgical industry may be doubled in the Second Five-Year Plan, and efforts will be made to build two factories with the investment of one factory. Vice-Chairman Emil Bodnăraș told Premier Zhou that some of the problems exposed by this ministry in socialist industrial construction had also been encountered in Romania's industrial construction.

The distinguished guests were very interested in a big-character poster exposing conservative thinking. The big-character poster said that the leadership of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry originally planned that the bricklaying project for a blast furnace in a factory would take 90 days. After discussion by the masses in the ministry, it was reduced to 75 days. When it was finally sent to the construction unit for the workers to discuss, they believed that 60 days would be enough. After reading this big-character poster, Premier Zhou said to the distinguished guests that the closer people are to reality, the more advanced their thinking, and the more people who sit in the office and do not get close to reality, the more backward their thinking. He also humorously said that the English word "bureaucracy" evolved from the word "office." Chairman Chivu Stoica and Vice-Chairman Emil Bodnăraș nodded frequently, expressing their agreement with Premier Zhou's words.

During the visit, welcoming crowds everywhere applauded and saluted the distinguished guests.

Accompanying the distinguished guests were also Vice-Premier Chen Yi, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, and China's Ambassador to Romania Ke Bonian, among others. (Attached picture)

    罗马尼亚贵宾参观大字报
    新华社2日讯　罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡和副主席埃米尔·波德纳拉希，今天傍晚由周恩来总理等陪同到冶金工业部参观了这个部的大字报。
    冶金工业部在反浪费反保守运动中已贴出大字报五十二万张。贵宾们今天到这里参观时，从这个部办公楼的第一层一直走到第五层，到处都看到大字报琳琅满目，有些走廊几乎被大字报堵塞，贵宾们不得不从大字报丛中侧身穿过。
    贵宾们极有兴趣地听了冶金部副部长吕东对这个部揭发批评各种缺点的大字报的介绍，基伏·斯托伊卡主席还向吕东询问了不少有关大字报的问题。吕东告诉贵宾们说，大字报是群众创造的一种社会主义民主形式，它真是解决了大问题。经过广大群众的深入揭露和大争大辩，如果第一个五年计划中的浪费现象能够逐步得到克服，中国冶金工业的建设速度就有可能在第二个五年计划中加快一倍，并且争取以一个工厂的投资建设两个工厂。埃米尔·波德纳拉希副主席对周总理说，这个部揭发出来的有关社会主义工业建设中的某些问题，在罗马尼亚的工业建设中也曾经碰到过。
    贵宾们对一张揭发保守思想的大字报发生了很大兴趣。这张大字报说冶金部领导上原订一个工厂的高炉砌砖工程需要九十天，经过部里的群众讨论后降到七十五天，而最后送到建设单位让工人们讨论时，他们认为只要六十天就够了。周总理看了这张大字报后对贵宾们说，越接近实际的人思想越先进，越是坐在办公室里不接近实际的人思想越落后。他并且有风趣地说，英文“官僚主义”这个字就是从“办公室”这个字演变而来的。基伏·斯托伊卡主席和埃米尔·波德纳拉希副主席频频点头，对周总理的话表示同意。
    参观时，到处都有欢迎的人群向贵宾们鼓掌致意。
