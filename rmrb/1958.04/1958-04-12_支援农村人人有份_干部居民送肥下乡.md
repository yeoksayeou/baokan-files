    The cadres and residents of the Jin Si Tu Temple area in Jiangning District, Shanghai, more than six hundred people in total, loaded ninety-three carts of fertilizer on various vehicles on the morning of March 31st and headed to the western suburbs in a mighty procession to support agricultural production. This fertilizer was accumulated by thousands of residents and cadres in the area over two days. The rectification campaign in the neighborhoods enhanced their love for socialism and their concern for large-scale agricultural production. Men and women, young and old, all worked to dig drainage ditches. Old Mrs. Ni Aifeng, seventy-three years old, even though others didn't want her to dig, went to the vegetable market to pick up vegetable scraps and sweep garbage, collecting more than two hundred catties. With such a unified effort, they accumulated forty-three tons in two days.

    支援农村人人有份  干部居民送肥下乡
    上海江宁区金司徒庙地区干部和里弄居民六百多人，在3月31日上午，用大小车辆装了九十三车肥料，浩浩荡荡送往西郊支援农业生产。这些肥料是该地区数千居民和机关干部在两天中积起来的。里弄整风提高了他们对社会主义的热爱和对农村大生产的关切。男女老少都在动手挖阴沟。七十三岁的倪阿凤老太太，别人不要她挖，她就到菜场去拣菜皮、扫垃圾，也搞了二百多斤。这样万众一心，两天中就积了四十三吨。
