A Record of Moving Graves
Qin Mu

	Before Qingming Festival, as the car drove through the Chao-Shan Plain, besides seeing fields of tender, yellowish-green rice seedlings and vegetables like lettuce and rape, the vast fields were mostly bare, waiting for the rice to be planted. The most striking scene was the leveling of land everywhere. High areas were being cut down, low areas filled in, and uneven land gradually transformed into a flat plain. Small, fragmented pieces of land were being connected and organized into neat furrows. Countless graves were being overturned, stone tablets piled up, and bones placed into urns or piled together, waiting to be moved to the mountainside for reburial. Newly opened, vertically and horizontally arranged field ditches were being spanned by melon sheds made of wood strips split from rotten coffin boards, on which gourds and pumpkins would be planted in the future. The ditches would also be used for fish farming. Just imagine that after the land is filled with rice seedlings, the thousand-mile plain will be a tapestry of beauty. Everywhere, ditches will be teeming with fish, and the endless melon sheds will be laden with fruit. It will not only be a scene of peace and prosperity and a magnificent picture of humanity conquering nature, but it will also be worthy of poetry and painting.
	This was the scene on the plains of this area in the spring of 1958. The activity of leveling land, like a prairie fire, started from one or two communes and quickly spread to the entire special zone, the whole province, and even many provinces across the country, with representatives coming to visit in an endless stream. It was clear that this activity, which was changing the face of the ancient earth's crust and greatly increasing arable land, was about to be promoted to many regions across the country. Land leveling is an activity that involves an extremely wide range. It will transform the soil, expand arable land, make roads straighter and smoother, and make fields more regular and uniform. However, this activity involves a major issue: the millions of graves scattered across the fields must be moved, which in turn involves the habits and thoughts of millions of people. In fact, in the heat of land leveling, almost everywhere—in cars, at stations, in farmers' homes, and along small roads—people were talking about moving graves and what they had seen during the excavations. This shows how exciting it was.
	I want to talk about my observations, experiences, and feelings solely from the perspective of moving graves.
	The people of the Chao-Shan area were originally no less superstitious than people in other places; in my opinion, they were even more superstitious. Because there are many fishermen and many overseas Chinese who make a living abroad, these people have to deal with the ocean, which naturally fosters a sense of awe towards nature in some people. In recent years, the situation has fundamentally changed, but the lingering influence cannot be ignored. The "Tin Hau Temple" in Shantou (equivalent to the Dragon Mother Temple in Yuecheng, Xijiang) is still very prosperous. In many towns in Chaozhou, you can still see people selling "Sun Sutras" and "Moon Sutras" for worshiping the "Sun God" and "Moon God" on the streets. Some people in this area are very particular about avoiding taboos. For example, they refuse to buy all-white chicks (forcing chicken vendors to dye all-white chicks with a little vermilion), they don't want to repair iron woks when a son is just born, and they don't allow locksmiths to pass by the front door, etc. In short, this was a region where superstitious practices were quite serious. Although it has changed a lot in recent years, it is still a case of "a lean camel being bigger than a horse." But it is precisely in such a region that millions of graves have been moved in a short period of time, and by the masses themselves! The key lies in the fact that the benefits of leveling land are so significant that people cannot help but be convinced. Especially the socialist moral concept: "No one should violate the public interest; the collective interest is above all else." A belief in a brand-new life: "Only through labor, and more efficient labor, can we all improve our lives together." Yes, it is these shining, sublime thoughts that have become the ironclad beliefs of the people, which is why the wave of moving graves and leveling land has quickly swept through thousands of villages.
	After the achievements of some advanced agricultural cooperatives in leveling land attracted national attention, countless agricultural cooperatives followed suit. They tied small green bamboos with triangular red flags and planted them all over the fields, marking the scope of the land to be leveled, announcing the date of the start of leveling, and doing a lot of ideological mobilization work. Anyone who wanted to move their own graves could excavate and move them before that deadline. After a certain deadline, the collective would excavate them, and all the remains would be combined and a public cemetery built. During this period, there were naturally thousands of different thoughts and feelings. But in my opinion, no one thought that this approach was bad. This does not only refer to advanced figures, but also includes all those who observe vegetarian diets, worship gods, and still believe in ghosts. Because everyone felt that this was the only way to continue to improve production. Advanced farmers passed on the word: "Let our ancestors also join us in construction." During this period of relocation, jars and urns in many towns were bought out. Some people also used lacquer boxes and wooden boxes to hold bones. For remote ancestors, people mostly allowed their remains to be buried together in the public cemetery.
	People were determined to level the land, but they also cherished the remains of their ancestors. So, some people even took out the lacquer boxes in their houses to use. In some ancient tombs, the bodies were not necessarily completely decomposed, so people personally washed the remains of their ancestors and then carefully placed them in urns and jars. Benevolent societies also played a role in this wave. They assisted people in cremating remains. Many of the directors of these benevolent societies are now farmers themselves. Members of the benevolent society pay a few yuan each year and contribute their efforts, doing good deeds that are recognized by everyone. The doorways of benevolent societies often have wooden signs hanging that read "Giving Coffins" and "Donating Medicine." This time, the benevolent society invented a method of cremating a set of remains with twelve catties of charcoal, which made it much easier for many people to relocate their ancestors' bones. The cremated ashes were either sent to ancient temples or buried nearby.
	During the relocation of graves, there were many large graves of ancient exploiters, which were surprisingly large. The largest tomb even occupied eight or nine acres. Before land leveling, the average arable land per capita in the Chao-Shan area was less than seven fen. Due to the dramatic increase in population and the construction of many roads and reservoirs, the average arable land continued to decrease. If we don't practice birth control, level land, reclaim wasteland, increase production, or relocate people, how many difficulties will there be in the future? But before the difficulties arrive, under the leadership of the Party, people have already started to crush them. Land leveling has increased arable land by about 10%. And those coffins and stone tablets can be used for paving roads, building bridges, and building melon sheds. The most solid coffins can even be used to make car wheels, which can help accelerate the realization of "car-ization."
	People actively participated in the activity of moving graves and leveling land. Many agricultural cooperatives did not rigidly require members to participate in the work of moving graves, but in general, almost everyone firmly participated. People were still carrying out this work on the first day of the Lunar New Year. Just this one thing is enough to imagine the high level of enthusiasm and the change in people's old ideas. Many strongmen and heroes emerged in this process. Some strong farmers had great strength, which people knew, but exactly how much strength they had was not easy to know under normal circumstances. Because the things they usually carried did not easily allow them to fully demonstrate their abilities. This time, when moving graves, because they had to transport large stone tablets, many strongmen showed their skills. When my hometown moved graves and leveled land, the weigher brought a four-hundred-catty scale to prepare to weigh the stones that people were carrying. A large stone carried by two farmers in the village who were known to be the strongest made the weighing device unable to weigh it. The farmers estimated that the stone weighed six hundred catties, which means that each village strongman could carry two to three hundred catties of things.
	During the great migration of graves, many people further enhanced their atheistic ideas. People dared to pick up a skull and sweep up a pile of bones at will, which fully demonstrated this idea. A farmer told me: "When a person dies, they are just a pile of waste. They have no sense of awareness themselves. It's all the same to them whether they are buried there or cremated. It's just that the living will think about them." These simple words profoundly express this atheistic idea. In fact, it was precisely in the heat of leveling land that people destroyed many idols. This was done by the farmers themselves. Countless families also no longer worshiped the countless death anniversaries of their ancestors (in the past, some families had to worship ten or twenty death anniversaries a year). However, the spirit of "remembering the end and pursuing the distant" is common to many people. A new custom has now begun, implementing "two sacrifices in spring and autumn." Everyone sacrifices to their ancestors on the spring and autumn equinoxes. Such sacrifices contain more commemorative meaning and less of the superstitious flavor of "souls, come and enjoy the offerings."
	The spring of 1958 was truly an extraordinary spring! How many new things emerged in this spring. In the great wave of leveling land and moving graves, we saw the qualities of thousands of new people growing. So this thing has not only huge material significance, but also greater spiritual significance. "Everyone should strive for the public interest, no one should violate the public interest, and the collective interest is above all else! Only through labor, and more efficient labor, can we all improve our lives together!" Such a powerful and great idea, like the spring breeze, has turned thousands of miles of rivers and mountains green and brightened the hearts of thousands of people.

    迁境记
    秦牧
    清明前，汽车驶过潮汕平原的时候，除了见到一丘丘鹅黄嫩绿的秧苗，莴苣、油菜之类的菜蔬外，一望无际的田野正裸露着，等待插秧。最触目的景象，则是到处都在平整土地，高的削平了，低的填高了，凹凸不平的土地渐渐变成一片平川，鸡零狗碎，一小块一小块的田地连起来了，被整理成整齐的畎亩。许许多多的坟墓被翻了起来，石碑叠成一堆，骨头给安置到一个个的缸瓮里或者堆放在一起，等待着迁到山旁重新埋葬。新开的纵横排列的田间沟洫上面，用烂棺材板劈成的木条架成了一个个的瓜棚，将来要在这上面种上丝瓜、南瓜之类的作物。沟洫里面还要养鱼。想想将来大地上插全秧苗以后，千里平原，一片锦绣。到处沟洫里跃着鱼雨，一望无际的瓜棚结瓜累累，那就不仅是一派太平盛世的景象，一幅人力征服自然的雄壮图样，而且简直可以入诗入画了。
    这就是1958年春天这一带平原的情景。平整土地的活动正像星火燎原似的，从一两个社开始，迅速蔓延到全个专区，全省以至国内许多省份都有不少代表络绎不绝地赶来参观。眼看这个给古老的地壳改变面貌，使耕地大大增加的活动即将推广到全国许多地区去。平整土地这事情涉及的范围广极了。它将改造土壤、扩大耕地、使公路修得更加笔直畅通，使田亩更加整齐划一。然而这活动牵连到一件重大的事情，那就是在田野里星罗棋布，数以百万座计的坟墓必须搬迁，这事情又牵涉到千千万万人的习惯和思想。事实上，在平整土地的热潮当中，汽车上、车站里、农户内、小路旁，几乎到处都听到人们在谈迁坟和发掘所见等事情。可见它是多么激动人心了。
    我想单从迁坟这件事情上，来谈谈自己的所见所闻所感。
    潮汕地区的人们，原本决不比其他地方的人们少点迷信，照我看来，不如说更加迷信一些。因为渔民多，到海外谋生的华侨多，这些人都得和海洋打交道，这就自自然然滋长了某些人对于大自然的敬畏心理。近几年来情形起了根本变化了，但流风余韵仍旧不容忽视。汕头的“天后庙”（相当于西江悦城龙母庙）现在香火仍鼎盛得很。潮州的不少市镇，街头上仍见有人在贩卖着祭“太阳神”、“月神”的太阳经、太阴经。这一带又有一些人是很会讲避忌的，例如不肯买全白的小鸡（累得鸡贩得给白鸡都染上一点朱红），刚生下儿子时不愿补铁镬，不许配锁匙的工匠经过大门口之类就是。一句话，这本是个迷信风气颇为严重的区域，这几年虽然改变很多了，仍然“瘦死的骆驼比马大”。但是就正是在这样一个区域，百万座坟墓在短短的时间内就迁移了，而且还是群众自己动手的！那关键，就在于平整土地的好处太显著了，使人看了不得不信服；尤其是一种社会主义的道德观念：“任何人都不应该违反公众的利益，集体的利益是高于一切的”。一种对崭新的生活的信念：“只有劳动，更有效率地劳动，才能大家一起改善生活”。是的，正是这样一些闪着光辉的崇高思想，成了人们铁一样的信念，这才使得迁移坟墓，平整土地的热潮，很快就席卷千万的乡村了。
    当一些先进的农业社平整土地的成绩引起全国的注意以后，无数的农业社都跟着动起来了。他们用小青竹结上三角红旗，在遍野插了起来，标出要平整的土地的范围，预告了要动手平整的日期，又做了许多的思想动员工作。谁要自己迁移坟墓的，都可以在那个期限以前发掘迁移。过了一定的期限，就由集体的力量来挖掘，把所有的骨殖会合在一起，筑成公墓。这期间，自然有千百种的思想状况。但照我看来，却没有谁认为这种做法有什么不好。这不是只指先进的人物而言，也包括一切吃斋的、拜神的、仍然相信神鬼的在内。因为大家都觉得这样做了才能继续提高生产。先进的农民辗转相告道：“也让祖先来和我们一起进行建设吧。”在这一段迁葬期间，许多乡镇的缸、瓮都给人购买一空。也有人用漆箱、木盒来盛骨头的。对于远代的祖先，人们多数是让他们的骨殖合葬到公墓里去。
    人们一方面坚决要平整土地，一方面也珍重着先人的遗骨。所以有的把屋里的漆箱也拿出来用了。有些古坟里葬的尸体，皮肉不一定都已化尽，人们就亲自给先人洗着遗骨，然后谨慎地放进瓮里缸里，善堂在这次热潮中也扮演了一个角色。他们协助人们烧化骨殖。这些善堂的执事者现在很多都是农民自己了。参加善堂的人每人每年缴几块钱，又出一把力，做着大家公认的善事。善堂的门口经常挂着“施棺”、“赠药”的木牌。这次，善堂发明了用十二斤炭烧化一副骨殖的方法，使许多人迁葬祖先骨头时得到不少方便。烧化了的骨灰，有寄到古寺去的，也有就近埋葬的。
    在迁坟中，有许多古代的剥削者的大坟，大的惊人，最大的一个坟墓，竟有占地八、九亩的。在平整土地以前，潮汕地区人民平均每人占有的耕地还不够七分，由于人口的剧增和许多公路、水库的建设，平均的耕地还有继续减少的趋势。如果不节育、不平整土地、不垦荒、不增加生产、不移民，将来该有多少的困难呵。但是，在困难来到之前，在党领导下，人们早就在动手把它粉碎了。平整土地使耕地面积增加约10％。而那些棺木和石碑呢，又可以铺路、筑桥、搭瓜棚，最坚固的棺木还可以用来造车轮子，这样，又可以有助于“车子化”的加速实现。
    人们积极地参加了这项移坟整地的活动。许多农业社对于迁坟的工作，并没有硬性规定社员都要参加，但一般几乎都坚决参加了。农历大年初一人们还在进行着这项劳动。只此一桩就可以想见人们热情的高涨、人们旧观念的改变了。在这里面涌现了许许多多的大力士和英雄好汉。有一些健壮的农民，力气很大，人家是知道的，但究竟有多大呢？平时却不易弄个清楚。因为往常挑的东西不容易让他们充分表现出本领。这次迁坟时因为要搬运大石碑，许多大力士就大显身手了。我的故乡迁坟整地的时候，秤手带了四百斤的磅码去准备秤人们抬来的石块。乡里号称力气最大的两个农民挑来的一块大石却使那个磅具无法秤得了，农民们估计那块石头有六百斤，这就是说，每个乡村大力士是可以挑起两百多三百斤的东西的。
    在坟墓大迁移当中，许多人更提高了无神论的思想。人们敢于随便拿起一个髑髅和打扫一堆骨头，正充分表现了这种思想。一个农民告诉我说：“人死了，就是一堆废物了，他自己就没有什么知觉了，葬在那里或者烧化，在他都是一样，不过活着的人会去想他罢了。”这几句朴素的话很深刻地表达了这种无神论思想。事实上，正是在平整土地的热潮中，人们又毁去了许多的神像。这是农民们自己进行的。无数人家也不再拜祖宗的数不清的忌辰了（在从前有些人家一年要拜一、二十个的忌辰）。但是“慎终追远”的精神却是许多人普遍有的，现在已经开始一个新的习俗，实行“春秋二祭”。大家都在春分和秋分这两天祭祖。这样的祭祖，包含的是较多的纪念意味，而比较少具有“魂兮来飨”的迷信味道了。
    1958年的春天真是一个不平凡的春天！多少新鲜的事物在这个春天里涌现。在平整土地、迁移坟墓的大热潮中，我们看到了千万新人的品质在成长。所以这事情不但具有巨大的物质上的意义，还具有更巨大的精神上的意义。“任何人都应该为公众的利益尽力，任何人都不应该违反公众的利益，集体的利益是高于一切的！只有劳动，更有效率地劳动，才能大家一起改善生活！”这样一种威力无比巨大的思想，正像春风一样，吹绿了万里江山，吹亮了万人的心。　（原载羊城晚报）
