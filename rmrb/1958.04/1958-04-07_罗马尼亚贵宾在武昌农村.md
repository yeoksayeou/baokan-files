Romanian Guests in the Rural Areas of Wuchang
By our reporter Yuan Mu

On the 6th, in the Shanhe Township of Wuchang County, 50 kilometers away from Wuhan City, the Romanian guests, headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Chivu Stoica, met with the vast number of Chinese farmers for the first time. The guests from the shores of the Black Sea showed boundless concern for China's agricultural development and the lives of farmers, leaving people with an unforgettable impression.

The azure sky was cloudless, and the warm spring breeze blew across the wheat ears, with a vast expanse of green waves rippling in the fields. At 10:00 a.m., when the guests, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and Governor of Hubei Province Zhang Tixue, appeared in the fields of the Jinxiu Agricultural Cooperative, firecrackers and drums sounded in unison, and the farmers greeted the guests with red flags.

Without any formalities or constraints, people's hearts immediately merged together as if they had reunited after a long separation. Chairman Chivu Stoica held a farmer's little girl tightly in front of him, asking the Romanian photographer who accompanied him to take a picture of them. Vice Chairman Bodnăraș presented the farmers with "Peace and Friendship" commemorative badges. Model worker and director of the agricultural cooperative, Cao Huaqing, presented the guests with two bags of soybeans and sesame that they had personally grown.

Wu Caisheng, the Secretary of the Wulijie District Committee of the Communist Party of China, had a one-mu wheat experimental plot in Jinxiu Cooperative, which attracted the attention of the guests. Wu Caisheng told the guests that his experimental plot adopted the method of "strip planting with close spacing," achieving four ploughings, six inches of deep ploughing, and 800 dan of fertilizer application. He said that the harvest this year could reach 500 jin, which would be twice as high as the average wheat yield of the cooperative.

Chairman Chivu Stoica and Vice Chairman Bodnăraș inquired in detail about when the plot was sown, when it would be harvested, what kind of agricultural tools were used, and even asked how many wheat plants were growing in the plot in total. They also told Wu Caisheng that the amount of fertilizer used in this experimental plot was exactly the same as the amount of fertilizer used in Romania's high-yield areas.

"Is this plot completely cultivated by yourself?" Chairman Chivu Stoica asked Wu Caisheng kindly.

"I cultivate it together with experienced farmers in the cooperative. This way, I can personally understand how to strive for high yields, and also absorb the rich experience of the farmers, break the conservatism in leadership work, and better promote large-scale high yields."

Chairman Chivu Stoica and other guests were very interested in this method of leading agricultural production, and they lingered in front of this experimental plot for more than half an hour.

Passing through many field ridges in single file, the guests arrived at a small reservoir that farmers in Shanhe Township had built last winter and this spring, which could irrigate 40,000 mu of land. Here, Chairman Chivu Stoica repeatedly praised the project as being well done, and he particularly appreciated this method of mobilizing the masses to build water conservancy projects themselves.

When the guests arrived at Wulijie Town, where the Shanhe Township government was located, the news of the guests' arrival immediately spread throughout the town. Almost all the farmers and handicraft workers who were at home in the town flocked to the streets, surrounding Chairman Chivu Stoica, Vice Chairman Bodnăraș, and Premier Zhou Enlai, and crowding them along the way. The guests shook hands and talked with the people who came to meet them from time to time. The intimate friendship between China and Romania and the close connection between the leaders of the two governments and the masses made this small town with several hundred households exceptionally active. Chairman Chivu Stoica squeezed into the crowd gathering at the eastern end of the town, asking the bustling farmers about the progress of the transactions. Then, he walked into a supply and marketing cooperative, a general merchandise retail department, and a cooperative for purchasing local products, asking the staff how much they sold in a day and the farmers' income from selling local specialties.

In the central club of the town, the guests carefully visited a small agricultural exhibition in Shanhe Township. It focused on the recent situation and experience of the farmers in the township in terms of water conservancy construction, agricultural tool improvement, and increasing unit area yield. According to Governor Zhang Tixue, farmers in Hubei Province have improved no less than several hundred kinds of agricultural tools last winter and this spring in order to achieve a great leap forward in agriculture. Chairman Chivu Stoica and Vice Chairman Bodnăraș carefully examined every improved agricultural tool created and imitated by the farmers of Shanhe Township displayed here, and inquired in detail about their effectiveness. Vice Chairman Bodnăraș sat on a large rock in the courtyard of the club, stroking a new agricultural tool created by the farmers of the township to remove weeds from the fields, reluctant to leave for a long time. Premier Zhou Enlai said to the guests in front of a double-wheeled double-铧 plow imitated and improved by the farmers of the township: "Not long ago, there was a trend that turned walking plows into hanging plows. In the overall leap forward, we restored its reputation after consulting with the masses. It can be seen that the great leap forward is very important." Premier Zhou's remarks aroused knowing laughter from the guests and all the farmers present. The Romanian guests all signed their names in the commemorative album before leaving.

Due to the enthusiastic guests lingering and forgetting to return, the guests' special plane, which was originally scheduled to take off from Wuhan at 1:30 p.m. to Beijing, had to be changed to take off at 3:00 p.m. When they left Shanhe Township, Wuchang County, amidst the enthusiastic applause of the farmers, they warmly congratulated the farmers on achieving greater success in this year's production.

    罗马尼亚贵宾在武昌农村
    本报记者　袁木
    6日，在距武汉市五十公里的武昌县山河乡，以部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡为首的罗马尼亚贵宾第一次同我国广大农民见了面。来自黑海之滨的客人们对我国农业发展和农民生活的无限关怀，给人们留下了难忘的印象。
    蔚蓝色的天空万里无云，和暖的春风吹拂着麦穗，广阔的田野上荡漾着一片碧绿的波浪。上午十时，贵宾们由周恩来总理和湖北省张体学省长陪同，出现在锦绣农业社的田地里时，鞭炮和锣鼓齐响，农民们打着红旗迎接贵宾。
    没有任何客套和拘束的仪式，人们的心立刻就像久别重逢一样交融在一起。基伏·斯托伊卡主席把一位农民的小女孩紧紧抱在身前，让随同前来的罗马尼亚摄影记者替他们留影。波德纳拉希副主席将“和平与友谊”的纪念章赠送给农民们。劳动模范、农业社主任曹华卿，把他们亲手种植的两袋黄豆和芝麻献给贵宾。
    中共五里界区区委书记吴才生在锦绣社种的一块一亩地的小麦试验田，吸引了贵宾们的注意。吴才生告诉贵宾，他的这块试验田采用了“条播密植”的办法，做到了翻耕四遍，深耕六寸，施肥八百担，今年收获时可以达到五百斤，比这个社的小麦平均产量将高出一倍。
    基伏·斯托伊卡主席和波德纳拉希副主席详细地询问了这块地何时播的种，何时收获，用的甚么农具，甚至还问到了这块地总共生长着多少株小麦。他们还告诉吴才生说，这块试验田的施肥量同罗马尼亚丰产地的施肥量正好相等。
    “你这块地是不是完全由你自己一个人种？”主席同志亲切地问吴才生。
    “我和社里有经验的农民们一起合种，这样既可以亲自了解如何争取丰产的方法，又可以吸收农民们的丰富经验，打破领导工作中的保守，更好地推动大面积丰产。”
    基伏·斯托伊卡主席和其他贵宾对这种领导农业生产的方法很感兴趣，他们在这块试验田前足足逗留了半个多小时。
    鱼贯地穿过许多条田埂，贵宾们来到了山河乡农民去冬今春修成的一座可以灌溉四万亩地的小型水库。在这里，基伏·斯托伊卡主席连连称道工程做的很好，他特别赞许这种发动群众自己大修水利的办法。
    当贵宾们来到山河乡乡政府所在地的五里界镇时，贵宾光临的消息立刻传遍全镇。所有这个镇上留在家里的农民和手工业工人，几乎全部拥到街上，把基伏·斯托伊卡主席、波德纳拉希副主席和周恩来总理等人团团围住，簇拥着他们一路前行。贵宾们不时同迎面而来的人们握手交谈，水乳交融般的中罗友谊和两国政府领导人同群众之间亲密无间的联系，使这个几百户人家的小镇变得异常的活跃起来。基伏·斯托伊卡主席挤进了正在镇东头上赶集的人群里去，向熙熙攘攘的农民们询问交易进行的情况，接着，他又走进一个供销合作社、一个杂货门市部和一个收购土产的合作社，询问工作人员一天售货多少钱，以及农民们出售土特产的收入情形。
    在这个镇的中心俱乐部里，贵宾们仔细参观了山河乡的一个小型农业展览会。这里集中了这个乡农民们最近时期在兴修水利、改良农具和提高单位面积产量方面的情况和经验。据张体学省长说，湖北省农民在去冬今春为实现农业大跃进已改进农具不下几百种。基伏·斯托伊卡主席和波德纳拉希副主席，对这里陈列的山河乡农民创造和仿制的每一件改良农具都仔细察看，详细询问它们的效能。波德纳拉希副主席坐在俱乐部院子里的一块大石头上，抚弄着一架这个乡农民创造的清除田间杂草的新农具，久久地不愿离开。周恩来总理在这个乡农民仿制改进的一架双轮双铧犁面前对贵宾们说：“不久前曾有一股风使步犁变成挂犁，在全面大跃进中，我们经过同群众商量已使它恢复了名誉，可见大跃进很重要。”周总理的这番话引起贵宾们和所有在场农民会心的笑声。罗马尼亚贵宾们临行时都在纪念册上签名留念。
    由于热情洋溢的贵宾们留连忘返，原定在下午一时半由武汉起飞前往北京的贵宾们的专机，不得不改在下午三时起飞。当他们在农民们的热烈掌声中离开武昌县山河乡时，热烈祝贺农民们在今年生产中获得更大的成就。（附图片）
