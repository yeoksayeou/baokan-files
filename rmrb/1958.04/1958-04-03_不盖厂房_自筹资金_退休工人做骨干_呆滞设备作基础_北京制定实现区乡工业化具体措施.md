Without Building Factories, Self-Raised Funds, Retired Workers as Backbone, Stagnant Equipment as Foundation
Beijing Formulates Specific Measures to Achieve District and Township Industrialization

(Our Newspaper Reporter Ye Jianyun reports) First the easy then the difficult, from simple to complex, filling poverty and relieving urgency, attacking the backward, this is the working principle adopted by the Beijing suburbs in implementing district and township industrialization this year.

The foundation of district and township industry in the suburbs of Beijing (mainly the five counties and one city before the merger) is very poor. The total number of factories, large and small, is less than fifty. Last year, the total industrial output value of the suburbs plus handicrafts was only more than 50 million yuan, accounting for only 33% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the suburbs. The distribution of these factories is also very concentrated. Tong County alone has thirty-one; while Shunyi, Daxing, and Changping, combined, have less than ten factories. In order to change this backward situation, the relevant leadership of Beijing has formulated a plan for developing suburban district and township industries. According to this plan, in 1958, the number of factories of all sizes in the suburbs will increase to more than 3,000; the total output value will reach 370 million yuan, accounting for 67% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the suburbs in the same year. The plan requires each district (the county before the expansion of the suburbs) to establish a district, township, and commune machinery repair and manufacturing network, with small-scale fertilizer plants in the districts, and granular fertilizer or bacterial fertilizer plants in the townships and communes. Each district should also have a large-vehicle tire retreading plant and a small cement plant. Factories and mines for papermaking, sugar making, winemaking, candied fruit, starch, oil extraction, coal mines, iron mines, marble, etc., should be established according to the principle of local materials and local processing. Some districts have several, some townships have one, and some communes have one. As for equipment for crushing coarse feed and chopping grass, each commune is required to have a set.

This is an advanced plan. To realize this plan, an investment of 75 million yuan, a working area of 40,000 square meters, more than 1,000 various technicians, and more than 120 machine tools and hundreds of tons of equipment are required. Although the suburbs of the capital have relatively convenient conditions, it will be difficult to handle such a large undertaking at once in terms of funds, equipment, and manpower. In order to overcome these difficulties, they have put forward specific measures to realize this plan, based on the principles of making do with whatever is available, raising funds themselves, spending less money, using less manpower, building quickly, and accomplishing more.

The first measure is not to build factories or dormitories. All the required working area will be provided by vacating houses from the public houses of district and township organs and financial and trade units. In addition, they can borrow or rent from residents with more spacious houses. Currently, in Tong County alone, nearly 10,000 square meters of houses have been vacated. The second measure is the issue of funds. Through tapping potential and mobilizing the masses to invest, they have already raised more than 15 million yuan. In order to effectively use funds, the planned construction projects are divided into two major categories: urgent and gradual. All those directly related to agricultural production are classified as urgent, and financial resources are concentrated on solving problems in this area. For urgent projects, first simple and then complex. Some large equipment will be gradually added after production has a foundation in the future. The third measure is the issue of technical force. In addition to mobilizing old workers from various factories and mines in the capital who have reached retirement age to serve as technical guidance in district and township factories, skilled workers from local state-owned factories and handicraft cooperatives will also be transferred to district and township factories as backbones. Currently, various enterprises in the capital have recommended more than 120 old workers to them. The fourth measure is the issue of equipment. Various factories and mines in Beijing have already drawn out a batch of surplus and stagnant machine tools and equipment to support the suburbs. This equipment will first equip and equip the machine repair factories in backward areas, and then meet the needs of machine repair factories in general areas. Prioritizing the equipment of machine repair factories is on the one hand to meet the needs of agricultural tool repair and manufacturing tasks, and on the other hand, it can also use these factories that have already been established to produce some of the equipment needed for the continued construction of sugar making, paper making, and fertilizer factories. In addition, some small factories in the city, such as starch and oil extraction factories, will be moved to the districts and townships, so that these factories can obtain materials locally and make full use of the waste materials.

In order to ensure the realization of the above measures, the municipal leadership organs have established a district and township industrial office. Each district also has a full-time party committee secretary to specifically plan and arrange various construction tasks.

### 不盖厂房　自筹资金　退休工人做骨干　呆滞设备作基础  北京制定实现区乡工业化具体措施

    不盖厂房　自筹资金　退休工人做骨干　呆滞设备作基础
    北京制定实现区乡工业化具体措施
    本报讯　记者叶剑韵报道：先易后难，从简到繁，填贫救急，突击落后，这是北京市郊区在今年内实行区乡工业化所采取的工作方针。
    北京市郊区（主要是合并前的五县一市）区乡工业的基础很差，大大小小的工厂算起来不足五十个；去年市郊工业总产值加上手工业也不过五千多万元，只占郊区工农业总产值的33％。这些工厂的分布又很集中，仅通县一地就有三十一个；而顺义、大兴、昌平等地，合起来还不到十个工厂。为了改变这种落后状况，北京市的有关领导方面，制定了一个发展郊区区乡工业的规划。根据这个规划，1958年郊区大大小小的工厂要增加到三千多个；总产值将达到三亿七千万元，占同年郊区工农业总产值的67％。规划要求，每个区（郊区未扩大以前的县）要建立一套区、乡、社机械修造网，区有小型化肥厂，乡社有颗粒肥料或细菌肥料厂，每区还要有一个大车轮胎翻修厂、一个小型水泥厂。造纸、制糖、酿酒、果脯、淀粉、榨油、煤矿、铁矿、大理石等厂矿，本就地取材就地加工的原则，有的一区数个，有的一乡一个，有的是一社一个。至于粗饲料粉碎、铡草等设备，要求每社有一套。
    这是个先进的规划。要实现这个规划，需要七千五百万元的投资，四万平方公尺的作业面积，一千多名的各种技术工人，还要有一百二十多台机床和数百吨的设备。虽然首都郊区有着比较便利的条件，但是，一下子要办这么大的事业，在资金、设备、人力方面是会有困难的。为了克服这些困难，他们根据因陋就简、资金自筹、花钱少、用人少、建的快、办事多的原则，提出了实现这个规划的具体措施。
    措施的第一条是不盖厂房不修宿舍，所需作业面积，全部由区乡机关和财贸单位的公房中腾出房子来，此外还可以向房屋较宽余的居民商借或租赁。目前仅通县一地，就腾出了近一万平方公尺的房屋。第二条是资金问题。经过挖潜力和发动群众投资，他们已经筹集了一千五百多万元资金。为了有效地利用资金，将规划中的建设项目分成急办和缓办的两大类。凡是目前和农业生产有直接关联的划为急办类，财力就集中解决这方面的问题。急办项目，先简后繁，一些大设备，等今后生产有了基础再逐步添置。第三条是技术力量问题。除动员首都各厂矿到了退休年龄的老工人去区乡工厂担任技术指导外，还将抽调地方国营各厂矿及手工业社的熟练工人，派往区乡工厂去当骨干。目前首都各企业向他们推荐的老工人已有一百二十多名。第四条是设备问题。北京各厂矿已经抽调出一批多余和呆滞的机床和设备支援郊区。这些设备将首先把落后地区的机修厂配齐配足，其次是满足一般地区机修厂的需要。尽先配备机修厂，一方面是满足农具修造任务的需要，另一方面也可以利用这些已经办起来的厂子，为继续举办的制糖、造纸、化肥等工厂生产所需的部分设备。此外，还将市内部分淀粉、榨油等小厂子迁到区乡去，使这些厂子能够就地取材，同时使下脚得到充分的利用。
    为了保证上述措施的实现，市级领导机关已成立了区乡工业办公室。各区也由一个专职党委书记，具体筹划安排各项建设任务。
