Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 28th: After the anti-Rightist struggle and rectification and other socialist self-remolding movements, the political and ideological outlook of the Shanghai local organizations of the China Democratic League has begun to shift to the left; the majority of members who were in an intermediate state are to varying degrees moving closer to the Party and to socialism. This was stated by Chen Wangdao, the person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, at the city's League members' representative meeting on the 26th.

In his "Report on the Rectification Movement of the Shanghai Democratic League" at the meeting, Chen Wangdao pointed out that "up to now, under the leadership of the Party and the instructions of the League Central Committee, the Shanghai Democratic League has politically and organizationally destroyed the positions of the Rightists, enabling the League organization to rein in its horse in time from the anti-Party and counter-revolutionary road. More than 80% of the members have examined and mutually criticized their erroneous political positions and ideological viewpoints, initially formulated personal plans to be both red and expert, and more than two hundred members have gone to the countryside to participate in labor training; however, these transformations are only a trend, and are far from completely transforming their political stance. Judging from the problems exposed in the general rectification, many members, from academic thought to dealing with people, are imbued with serious ideas of personal fame and gain, and this kind of thinking has not been thoroughly investigated and discredited. The historical lesson of the anti-Rightist struggle within the League seriously teaches us that without thoroughly discrediting and eradicating the various forms of bourgeois individualism, there will be a danger of falling into losing the political direction again."

Shen Junru, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, congratulated the Shanghai Democratic League representative meeting on behalf of the League Central Committee, and he encouraged all members of the city: "Bourgeois intellectuals must be both red and expert, and serve socialism wholeheartedly. Discrediting bourgeois individualism is the most important part; I hope everyone will work together." Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, congratulated the increasingly healthy organization of the Shanghai Democratic League on behalf of the Municipal Committee, and he made a report to more than 400 League member representatives on issues such as the socialist construction line and the ideological remolding movement of intellectuals. He suggested that members of the Democratic League thoroughly implement the rectification movement, see through the "mortal world" of bourgeois individualism, thoroughly discredit it as a poisonous substance of all evils, and give their hearts to the people.

The representative meeting elected Chen Wangdao, Liu Simu, Su Buqing and other fifty-one people as members and alternate members of the Fourth Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League. The meeting also unanimously adopted the Shanghai Democratic League's transformation plan and rectification plan. In the transformation plan, it was decided to make political and ideological education of League members the main work of the Shanghai League in the future, and it was decided to further deepen the ideological remolding movement of "five destructions and five establishments" (destroying bourgeois individualism, establishing socialist collectivism; destroying the contempt for labor and for workers and peasants, establishing the labor viewpoint and the mass viewpoint; destroying the separation of business from politics, establishing being both red and expert; destroying detachment from reality, inconsistency between words and deeds, establishing the combination of theory and practice; destroying right-leaning conservatism, establishing advanced innovation) among all League members in the city, and moving towards the goal of striving for more than 50% of members to become leftists and middle-leftists this year.

### 民盟上海市盟员代表大会作出决定  开展“五破五立”思想改造运动

    民盟上海市盟员代表大会作出决定
    开展“五破五立”思想改造运动
    新华社上海28日电　经过反右派斗争和整风等社会主义自我改造运动，民盟上海市地方组织的政治思想面貌开始向左转化；曾处于中间状态的多数成员正在不同程度上向党、向社会主义靠拢。这是民盟上海市委员会负责人陈望道26日在全市盟员代表大会上说的。
    陈望道在会上所作的“上海民盟整风运动报告”中指出，“到目前为止，上海民盟在党的领导和盟中央指示下，虽然已从政治上、组织上摧毁了右派的阵地，使盟组织及时从反党、反革命的道路上悬崖勒马，80％以上的成员都检查和相互批判了自己错误的政治立场和思想观点，初步制订了红透专深的个人规划，二百多个成员已到农村参加劳动锻炼；但是这些转化还只是一种倾向，距离彻底完成政治立场的改造还很远。从一般整风中暴露出来的问题看，不少成员从学术思想到待人接物，都贯串着严重的个人名利思想，这种思想还没有查透搞臭。盟内反右派斗争的历史严重地教训我们，不彻底搞臭革掉形形色色的资产阶级个人主义，将有重陷迷失政治方向的危险”。
    中国民主同盟中央委员会主席沈钧儒代表盟中央向上海民盟代表大会祝贺，他勉励全市盟员说：“资产阶级知识分子要红透专深，一心一意为社会主义服务，搞臭资产阶级个人主义是最重要的一环；希望大家共同努力”。中共上海市委员会书记处书记魏文伯代表市委到会祝贺上海民盟组织的日益健康，他向四百多盟员代表作了社会主义建设路线和知识分子思想改造运动等问题的报告。他建议民盟成员把整风运动贯彻始终，看穿资产阶级个人主义的“红尘”，把它当作万恶的毒物一样彻底搞臭，把心交给人民。
    代表大会选举陈望道、刘思慕、苏步青等五十一人为民盟上海市第四届委员会委员和候补委员。会议还一致通过了上海民盟改造规划和整改方案。在改造规划中，决定把对盟员进行政治思想教育列为今后上海盟的主要工作，决定在全市盟员中进一步深入展开“五破五立”（破资产阶级个人主义，立社会主义集体主义；破轻视劳动、轻视工农，立劳动观点和群众观点；破业务脱离政治，立又红又专；破脱离实际，言行不一，立理论结合实际；破右倾保守、立先进革新）的思想改造运动，向着争取50％以上成员在今年成为左派和中左的目标前进。
