    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 6th - The Indian Communist Party's special congress opened in Amritsar this afternoon. The congress is scheduled to conclude on April 13th. Six hundred delegates representing 250,000 Indian Communist Party members are participating in this special congress.
    General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh, E.M.S. Namboodiripad, S.A. Dange, and other communist leaders attended the congress.
    Prior to this, the delegates had laid wreaths at the historically significant Jallianwala Bagh, to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the anti-British struggle.
    The special congress will discuss the draft political resolution formulated by the Central Committee of the Indian Communist Party, and will also adopt the amended Party Constitution.
    On the eve of the special congress, the "National Herald" published a commentary stating: "Since the Palghat Congress, there is no doubt that the Indian Communist Party has grown in both quantity and influence." The newspaper pointed out that the Communist Party is in power in one state, is the main opposition force in two other states, and is the largest opposition party in parliament. The number of Communist Party members is rapidly increasing.
    The "Deccan Herald" emphasized that the importance of this special congress lies in the fact that it is being held the day after the first anniversary of the Communist Party's rule in Kerala.

    印共特别代表大会开幕
    有代表二十五万党员的六百名代表参加
    新华社新德里6日电　印度共产党特别代表大会今天下午在阿姆利则开幕。大会预定在4月13日结束。参加这次特别代表大会的有六百名代表，代表印度二十五万党员。
    总书记高士和埃·马·桑·南布迪里巴德、斯·阿·丹吉以及其他共产党领袖都出席了这次代表大会。
    在这之前，代表们曾经到具有历史意义的迦利安瓦拉拔格，安放了花圈，表示悼念在反英斗争中牺牲的烈士。
    特别代表大会将讨论印度共产党中央委员会拟订的政治决议草案，还将通过经过修正的党章。
    在特别代表大会的前夕，“国民先驱报”发表评论说：“自从帕尔加特代表大会以来，毫无疑问，印度共产党在数量上和影响方面都增长了。”这家报纸指出，共产党在一个邦执政，在其他两个邦是反对党的主要力量，在议会中是人数最多的反对党。共产党党员的数目在迅速地增加。
    “德康先驱报”强调说，这一次特别代表大会的重要性在于这样一个事实：它是共产党人在喀拉拉邦执政的第一周年纪念日的第二天举行的。
