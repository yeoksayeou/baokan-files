According to Yunnan Daily: At the "Valuing the Past, Disparaging the Present Book Exhibition" held by the History Department of Kunming Normal College, it is shocking to see that ancient books occupy an absolute advantage in the students' existing books: things like "Selected Ancient Prose Readings by Sheng Tan," "Zhuangzi Nanhua Jingjie," "Illustrated Supervised Edition of the Book of Changes," etc.; while books such as "The Communist Manifesto" and "A History of the New Democratic Revolution" are "as rare as morning stars."

Among the owners of the exhibited books, the most prominent is Yue Jinghe. Among all his books, there is only one work by Engels; the ratio by number of books is thirty to one, and by number of volumes is one hundred and twenty-five to one. Yang Hua has thirty-nine volumes of ancient books but only four volumes of Marxist-Leninist books. Under the influence of teachers' thinking of "happy to have insightful friends, regretting not having the time to read ancient books," many students try every means to buy ancient books. At the exhibition, a large table of statistics of ancient books read was compiled for Ma Shaohua, who was most deeply influenced by ancient books, while his political ideology has always been negative, advocating "specialization first, then redness"; he violated labor discipline, grumbled, and worked passively during river repairs.

Some students who were influenced by the "Valuing the Past, Disparaging the Present" thought posted big-character posters with heartfelt self-criticisms.

    昆明师范学院历史系举办
    “厚古薄今”图书展览
    本报讯　据云南日报报道：在昆明师范学院历史科系举办的“厚古薄今图书展览会”上，触目惊心的使人看到，学生现有的图书中，古代书籍占着绝对的优势：什么“圣叹选古文读本”、“庄子南华经解”、“绘图监本易经”等等；而“共产党宣言”、“新民主主义革命史”等书籍，却“寥若晨星”。
    展出的书籍主人中，最突出的是岳经和。他全部的书籍里，只有一本恩格斯的著作，按部数是三十比一，按册数是一百二十五比一，杨华有古书三十九册，只有四册马列主义书籍。在教师“喜有眼明交友良，恨无身暇读古书”的思想影响下，许多学生都生方设法购买古书。会上给一个受古书影响最深的马少华，列了一大张读过的古书统计表，而他的政治思想情况却是一贯消极，主张“先专后红”；在修河时破坏劳动纪律、发牢骚、消极怠工。
    一些受“厚古薄今”思想影响的学生，贴出了沉痛检查的大字报。
