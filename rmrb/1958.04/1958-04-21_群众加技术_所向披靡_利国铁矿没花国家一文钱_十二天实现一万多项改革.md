    Masses plus Technology are All-Conquering
    Liguo Iron Mine Spends Not a Penny of State Money, Implements Over 10,000 Reforms in Twelve Days
    (Reported by this newspaper) Xinhua Daily reported: The Liguo Iron Mine in Xuzhou mobilized the masses to engage in systematic and comprehensive technological innovation using simple methods. From April 1st to 12th, it has already implemented 11,842 innovation proposals and 31 major innovations, without asking the state for a single penny. The comprehensive technological innovation has rapidly and profoundly changed the production landscape of the mine, and guarantees that the leaping progress target of "doubling" iron ore production this year can be achieved without increasing investment or personnel.
    This year, the state assigned the Liguo Iron Mine an annual iron ore production target of 300,000 tons. In the first quarter, all mine workers continuously raised the leaping progress targets, and on March 28th, they put forward the fighting slogan of "Breaking through 500,000, striving to double." When the mine's Party committee discussed measures to achieve this leaping progress target, it realized that merely solving a few key production problems in a piecemeal fashion would not be enough to complete the task. It was necessary to comprehensively reform technology, mainly to further improve the degree of small-scale mechanization, in order to raise the overall production level to a new height. However, this would require adding a large number of equipment and more than 200 production personnel. Thus, the following question was posed to the mine's leading cadres: How can we innovate technology and achieve the leaping progress target without increasing investment or personnel?
    At that time, the double-comparison campaign throughout the mine was at its peak, and the workers of the third field implemented ten innovation measures on March 29th. This was an important inspiration for the mine leaders, who realized that the key to solving the problem lay in fully mobilizing the masses. For example, some people believed that to eliminate manual pushing of carts, machines had to be used to pull them, and buying diesel locomotives would cost money, making it difficult to do things without money. However, Peng Guangying and other railway workers from the third field suggested a "self-weight flow car," which does not require human pushing or locomotive pulling, but uses the difference in inclination of the small railway to make the mine car slide automatically, solving a major problem without spending money. The Party committee seized this advanced seedling and further mobilized the workers of the third field to discuss it. The next day, the number of innovation measures increased to 52, involving all important aspects of mine production. This further inspired the mine leaders, who realized the need for a programmatic technological innovation plan to guide and concentrate the wisdom of the masses to solve the major problem of comprehensive innovation. Therefore, after research and discussion, a draft of a technological innovation program was formulated and submitted to all mine workers for discussion, widely absorbing reasonable opinions from the masses. Then, a 72-item technological innovation program for the entire mine, with small-scale mechanization as the basic direction, was determined. Each item was further divided into several sub-items, proposing tasks and pointing out directions for systematic and comprehensive innovation for all types of work and processes throughout the mine. Immediately afterward, the mine's Party committee, with the technological innovation program as the center, launched a upsurge of rationalization proposals throughout the mine of "everyone contributes ideas, everyone engages in innovation." In three days, the masses put forward 99,338 innovation proposals, an average of more than 40 per person, making technological innovation truly a mass movement that reached everyone. In order to quickly implement the innovation measures, the mine leaders, on the one hand, seized major innovation projects, turned them into hard tasks, personally took command at key points, organized forces, and launched a concentrated reform; on the other hand, they mobilized the masses to find their own ways to implement their own innovation proposals, so that major innovations and minor improvements throughout the mine surged forward like a thousand troops and ten thousand horses.
    A large number of bold songs praising technological innovation emerged in the mine, and the whole mine began to sing the leaping progress song of "Thrifty and thrifty again, ask less money from above, small-scale mechanization, don't dislike the broken." The masses brought their creativity into full play and thought of various simple methods, and in a very short period of time, they realized many things that were considered impossible in the past. For example, changing small-scale blasting to medium and large-scale blasting is a top priority for improving mining and stripping efficiency. This would require replacing the existing pneumatic drill with an impact drill. Purchasing an impact drill would cost about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Technician Wu Yunfeng, who came from a working-class background, said, "We'll make it ourselves!" At that time, some technicians believed that they could not make it themselves, and even if they tried, it would take several months. However, with the support of the Party and the full assistance of the masses, Wu Yunfeng worked day and night and made it in less than ten days. It was put into production on April 8th. All the parts were made of waste and old materials, and nothing was bought with state money. The mine has now decided to manufacture them in batches. The workers of the motorized section used broken equipment and waste materials to assemble a diesel locomotive, three winches, five water pumps, and a lathe in about ten days, strongly supporting small-scale mechanization. Railway workers and loading workers, etc., worked day and night to realize the "self-weight flow car," and the mine leaders personally persuaded them to rest, but they refused. The workers said, "Suffer for a few days, be happy for a lifetime." After the self-weight flow car was realized, it not only increased transportation efficiency by five times and completely eliminated the heavy physical labor of pushing carts, but also made the job of cart pusher a historical term.
    In just about ten days, a wonderful and moving new scene appeared in the mine: mine cars, without locomotives pulling or people pushing, joyfully walked on their own, unmanned winches automatically started and stopped according to production needs, water pumps automatically determined their own movement, and soil and rock automatically unloaded and loaded, the entire mine was basically equipped with the scale of small-scale mechanization. According to preliminary calculations, the economic effect of only eleven technological innovations can save 139 people.
    The Liguo Iron Mine, which completed the first quarter's state plan 21 days ahead of schedule, after implementing comprehensive technological innovation, the total output of iron ore in the first ten days of April has increased sharply by 21.9% compared with the same period in March.

    群众加技术　所向披靡
    利国铁矿没花国家一文钱　十二天实现一万多项改革
    本报讯　新华日报报道：徐州市利国铁矿发动群众用穷办法大搞系统的、全面的技术革新，从4月1日到12日，已经实现了革新建议一万一千八百四十二条和重大革新三十一项，没有伸手向国家要一文钱。全面的技术大革新使矿山的生产面貌迅速地发生了深刻而巨大的变化，并保证了今年铁石产量“翻一翻”的跃进指标能够在不增投资不增人的前提下实现。
    今年国家下达给利国铁矿的全年铁石产量为三十万吨。在第一季度中全矿职工不断提高跃进指标，3月28日又提出了“冲破五十万，力争翻一翻”的战斗口号。矿党委在讨论实现这个跃进指标的措施时，看到了如果只是零打碎敲地解决几个生产关键是不能完成任务的，必须全面革新技术，主要是进一步提高小型机械化的程度，才能把整个生产水平提高到新的高度。可是这样就需要增加大批设备和二百多个生产人员。于是在矿的领导干部面前就提出了这样一个问题：怎样才能做到在不增投资不增人的前提下来革新技术、实现跃进指标？
    当时，全矿的双比运动正是高潮，三场的职工在3月29日实行了十项革新措施。这对矿领导上是一个重要的启发，认识到解决问题的关键在于充分发动群众。例如有些人认为要消灭人力推车就得用机器拉，买柴油机车头就得花钱，无钱不好办事。而三场铁道工彭广营等建议的“自重流车”，不用人推也不用机车拉，而是运用小铁道倾斜度的高低差来使矿车自动滑行，不花钱就可以解决一个大问题。党委抓住这个先进萌芽，进一步发动三场职工讨论。第二天革新措施就增加到五十二项，涉及到矿山生产的各个重要方面。这又启发了矿领导上，认识到需要有一个纲领性的技术革新计划，以引导和集中群众智慧来解决全面革新的大问题。于是经过研究讨论，作出了一个技术革新纲要草案，提交全矿职工讨论，广泛吸取群众合理的意见，然后确定了以小型机械化为基本方向的全矿技术革新大纲七十二项，每项又分成若干条，为全矿各个工种和工序进行系统的全面的革新提出了任务和指出了方向。紧接着矿党委又以技术革新大纲为中心，发动全矿职工掀起了一个“人人献计谋，个个干革新”的合理化建议高潮。三天中群众就提出九万九千三百三十八条革新建议，平均每人达四十多条，使技术革新真正形成了普及到每个人的群众运动。为了迅速实现革新措施，矿领导上一面抓住重大革新项目，变成硬任务，亲自到关键口上阵挂帅，组织力量，突击进行改革；一面又发动群众自找办法实现自提的革新建议，使全矿的大革新和小改进如千军万马一齐奔腾。
    矿山上大量地涌现了歌颂技术革新的豪迈的歌谣，全矿唱起了“勤俭再勤俭，少向上要钱，小型机械化，破烂都不嫌”的跃进之歌。群众发挥创造性想各种穷办法，在极短的时间里实现了许多过去被认为是不可能做到的事情。例如把小型爆破改为中、大型爆破，是提高采矿和剥离效率的一个头等重要的大问题。为此就需要以冲击钻来代替现用的风钻。而购买一台冲击钻约需七、八万元。老工人出身的技术员吴云峰说：“我们自己造！”当时有的技术人员认为自己造不出来，就是试造也要几个月。但是吴云峰在党的支持和群众的通力协助下，昼夜苦干，不到十天就造成了，并在4月8日投入生产，全部机件都用废料旧料制成，没有一样东西是另外花国家的钱买的，现在矿上已决定成批制造。机动科的职工利用破旧设备和废料，在十天左右的时间里就装制成了一部柴油机车头、三部卷扬机、五部水泵和一部车床，有力地支持了小型机械化。铁道工、装车工等为了实现“自重流车”，白天黑夜不停地干，矿的领导同志亲自去劝他们休息也不肯。工人说：“苦干几天，幸福一辈子”。自重流车实现后，不但使运输效率提高了五倍，全部解除了手推车的沉重的体力劳动，而且使推车工这个工种成了历史上的名词。
    仅仅是十天左右的时间，矿山上出现了一片奇妙动人的新景象：没有机车拉也没有人推的矿车欢腾地自己奔走，无人操纵的卷扬机随着生产需要而自动地启动和停止，水泵自定行止，土岩自己卸车装车，全矿已基本上具备了小型机械化的规模。据初步计算，仅十一项技术革新的经济效果，就可节约一百三十九人。
    提前二十一天完成了第一季度国家计划的利国铁矿，实行全面技术革新后，全矿4月上旬的铁石总产量已比3月份同期剧增了21.9％。
