    Sham Neutrality
    As the Batista dictatorial regime in Cuba tottered, US Secretary of State Dulles, who had always been extremely hostile to the national independence movements of the people of Latin American countries, put on a “good guy” act. On April 8, when answering a reporter's question about the United States recently stopping arms shipments to the reactionary government of Cuba, he said: "We do not want to send that kind of weapon (note: referring to a shipment of rifles) to a place intended for civil war."
    Dulles' words are both true and false. The truth is that since "the State Department has sent a large number of tanks and artillery to the Cuban dictator for several years" (according to a report in the "New York Post" on April 2), Dulles might "not want" to send light weapons such as rifles to Batista at a time when the Cuban situation is attracting worldwide attention. The falsehood is that Dulles is merely using these words to cover up the criminal act of the US military delegation stationed in Cuba directly commanding the dictator's army to fight and transferring weapons to Batista through the Dominican dictator Trujillo, thereby interfering in Cuba's internal affairs.
    However, pretending to be a "good guy" cannot hide Dulles' sinister face. The "New York Post's" assessment of Dulles is fair: "This is the most blatant example of immoral false neutralism in Dulles' entire moral life."
    Sima Zhao's Intentions
    The United States and the Adenauer government have repeatedly demanded that the summit conference discuss the issue of German reunification. It seems that they are extremely concerned about German reunification.
    The famous American political commentator Lippmann recently visited Europe and is said to have discovered a "strange phenomenon": "Those who stand with the West insist on the Dulles-Adenauer plan for German reunification through free elections in public and formal occasions. This is not because they believe in this plan, but because they know that Germany cannot be reunified according to this plan. Therefore, almost no one expects this plan to work, and almost no one really wants it to work."
    Since the Dulles-Adenauer plan is not intended to achieve German reunification, why do they insist on that plan? Lippmann did not answer this question. But there is no mystery here. Dulles and Adenauer's intentions are as plain as day, they just want to sabotage the summit conference.

    札记
    假中立
    在古巴巴蒂斯塔独裁政权摇摇欲坠的时候，一贯对拉丁美洲国家人民的民族独立运动采取极端仇视态度的美国国务卿杜勒斯却装起“好人”来了。他在4月8日答复记者提出的美国最近停止给古巴反动政府运送武器的问题时说：“我们不希望把那种武器（按：系指一船步枪）输送到目的在于进行内战的地方去。”
    杜勒斯这番话也真也假。真的是，既然“国务院几年来送给古巴独裁者大量坦克和大炮”（据“纽约邮报”4月2日报道），杜勒斯可能“不希望”在举世注目古巴局势的时候，把像步枪这类轻武器运送给巴蒂斯塔。假的是，杜勒斯不过是用这番话来掩饰驻古巴美国军事代表团直接指挥独裁者的军队作战和通过多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略把武器转运给巴蒂斯塔这种干涉古巴内政的罪恶行为罢了。
    但是，假装“好人”是掩饰不住杜勒斯的罪恶嘴脸的。“纽约邮报”对杜勒斯的评价倒是公正的：“这是杜勒斯整个道德生活中最明显的不道德的假中立主义例子。”
    司马昭之心
    美国和阿登纳政府一再提出要求最高级会议讨论德国重新统一问题。好像他们对德国重新统一真是关心的了不得。
    美国有名的政论家李普曼最近去了一次欧洲，据说发现了一个“奇怪的现象”：“那些同西方站在一起的人在公开和正式的场合坚持通过自由选举来统一德国的杜勒斯—阿登纳方案。这不是因为他们相信这个方案，而是因为他们知道，德国不可能按照这个方案实现统一。因此，几乎没有什么人期望这个方案起作用，几乎没有人真正希望它起作用”。
    既然，杜勒斯—阿登纳的方案不是为了实现德国的统一，那么，他们为什么要坚持那个方案呢？李普曼没有答复这个问题。不过这里面并没有什么奥妙。杜勒斯和阿登纳的目的是司马昭之心路人皆知，不过是为了要破坏最高级会议罢了。
