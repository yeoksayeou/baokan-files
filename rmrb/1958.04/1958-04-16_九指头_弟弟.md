    "Nine-Fingered" Little Brother
    Zhu Gan

    On my way home, I was thinking: Now that patriotic health campaigns are being carried out everywhere to eliminate the four pests, what will happen to my "nine-fingered" little brother?

    My brother is missing a finger on his left hand, and the villagers call him "Nine Fingers."

    One day, the year before last, he came home from school, tugged at Mom's sleeve, and asked bitterly, "Mom, tell me! How did I lose a finger?"

    Just then, a startled rat scurried across the beam with a squeak. Mom said, "Okay! Ask the rat, it knows the story of 'Nine Fingers'!"

    He was surprised and pestered Mom to explain. Mom sighed and said, "That year, you were less than two months old, just the size of a small pillow, crying all day long. Your dad and I were farming for the landlord, the greedy Black Fortune, and we didn't have time to take care of you often! During the day, before I went down the slope, I stuffed some straw into a basket, put you in it, and tied it to the beam with a rope. One day at noon, I came back to nurse you. As soon as I opened the door, oh! A rat as long as a chopstick suddenly jumped out of the basket, ah! It scared me so much I got goosebumps all over! I put the basket down and looked, oh my god! Sure enough, you were missing that finger! Drops of fresh blood on the straw..." Mom said, her eyes welling up.

    After that, whenever "Nine Fingers" saw a rat, he would tremble all over, cover his face, cry, and hide. He couldn't sleep when he heard rats at night, clinging to Mom's chest. ...

    When I reached the village entrance, I saw a red headline on the blackboard newspaper: Rat-Catching Little Hero – “Nine Fingers.” I was surprised. Looking further down, it read: “During the Four Pests Elimination Campaign Month, ‘Nine Fingers’ eliminated two hundred and fifty-five rats, an average of eight and a half rats per day...”

    I couldn't believe my eyes and had to go home and ask.

    A bright red Four Pests Elimination good news poster was pasted on the door. Mom was wearing a mask and washing utensils in the courtyard. When Mom saw me, she didn't say hello, only whispered, "Go and check behind the house, the rope is behind the tree. When the sparrows get on the basket, you have to pull hard! You have to be quick!"

    I didn't see a single sparrow. Back in the courtyard, I asked Mom, "Where's 'Nine Fingers'?" "It's Sunday! Catching rats, of course!"

    "Became a rat-catching hero, how strange!"

    "Hey! What's so strange? It's just that he's got the knack! At first, he had the same old problem, trembling when he saw a rat. The Four Pests Elimination campaign got so heated, and the children who caught rats were praised. He was so anxious he cried. One day, he thought of a way to ask me to find a dead rat for him to look at. It's really funny! He stood far away, covering his face, looking through his fingers. Then he took a few steps closer and put his hand down. Then? He just moved forward step by step, bending over to look carefully! He blinked and said, 'Mom, I was so stupid before! What's there to be afraid of about this little thing?'"

    "Once he got over his fear, he had a lot of energy! Things like 'rat traps'! 'Trap boxes'! 'Chain locks'! 'Antu powder'! He learned all these methods! He sets up an ambush at every rat hole and every rat footprint!..."

    I went into the house, lay on the bed, and was just dozing off when I heard a burst of laughter in the courtyard.

    "Mom! Look! I just dug a hole and caught a whole nest, ha ha, nine of them, big and small!" It was clearly the voice of "Nine Fingers."

    "Hey! What's so rare about that! I caught eleven sparrows while cleaning up the house!" This was Mom's voice.

    "Haha! Mom, you're better than me; but I'm even better than the little cat. It's so cautious all day long and only caught three. Mom, we have to give it a Great Leap Forward too!" It was "Nine Fingers" again. ...

    A burst of gunfire and drumming came from the village road, and I couldn't sleep anymore.

    “九指头”弟弟
    朱干
    我在回家的路上，寻思着：现在到处开展爱国卫生运动，除四害，“九指头”弟弟可怎么办呀？
    弟弟左手少了个指头，村里人叫他“九指头”。
    大前年一天，他放学家来，扯住妈的衣袖，苦苦的问道：“妈，你说嘛！我怎么少了个指头？”
    正在这时，一只受惊的老鼠，吱的一声，从梁上窜跳过去。妈说：“好啦！你问问老鼠吧，它知道
  ‘九指头’的故事”！
    他惊奇了，缠着妈妈，要问个明白。妈妈叹口气说：“那年，你生下还不满两月，就像小枕头那么大，整天哇呀哇的。我和你爸爸给地主黑财迷种地，哪有工夫经常照看你呀！白天，我下坡之前，在篓筐里塞把谷草，把你放进去，用绳子系在梁上。有天中午，我回来奶你。一开了门，哟！一只筷子长的老鼠，忽然从篓筐里跳出来，哎！把我吓的浑身起疙瘩！我放下篓筐一瞧，天哪！可不是，你指头就少了这么一个！草上一滴滴鲜血……”妈妈说着，眼圈潮湿。
    以后，“九指头”一见老鼠，就全身哆嗦，掩面哭叫着躲开。半夜听到老鼠叫，伏在妈妈怀里睡不着。……
    我到了村头，见黑板报上红色大标题写着：捕鼠小英雄——“九指头”。我诧异了，再往下看，上面写着：“九指头”在除四害突击月内，扑灭老鼠二百五十五只，平均每天扑灭八只半……
    我不相信自己的眼睛，要到家问个明白。
    门上贴着鲜红的除四害捷报。妈戴着口罩，在天井里洗涤家什。妈见我，并不搭话，只低声说：“你快去屋后瞧瞧，绳头放在树背后，雀儿上筐时，就得猛一拉呀！可得机灵些！”
    我没见一个雀儿。回到天井里，我问妈：“‘九指头’呢？”“星期天嘛！捕鼠呗！”
    “成了捕鼠英雄，真怪！”
    “嘿！怪什么？该他有心窍呗！开头，还是老毛病儿，见老鼠就哆嗦。除四害运动搞的火热，捕鼠的孩子受表扬。他急的光哭。有一天，他想了个门道，叫我找只死老鼠，让他看看。说来真好笑哩！他离的老远，掩着脸，从手缝里看。后来走近几步，就放下手；再后来呢？就这么一步步向前挪动，弯腰仔细看啦！他?了?眼，笑着说：‘妈，我以前真蠢！这麻点东西，有啥怕头？’”
    “他一放开胆，可就有股子干劲！什么‘鼠夹’呀！‘套匣’呀！
  ‘连环锁’呀！‘安特粉’呀！这些法儿，都学会啦！见个鼠洞，见个鼠脚印，都布下阵势哩！……”
    我走进屋里，床上一躺，正蒙矓欲睡，只听天井里一阵欢笑声。
    “妈！你瞧！我方才掏了个洞，弄住一窝，哈哈，老小九只啊！”这分明是“九指头”的声音。
    “咦！那有啥稀罕！我拾掇家什，稍带捕住十一只麻雀哩！”这是妈妈的声音。
    “哈哈！妈妈，你比我强；我可又比小花猫强。它整天价那么小心翼翼的，才咬住三只。妈，也得叫它来个跃进呀！”又是“九指头”的声音。……
    村道上传来一阵枪声和锣鼓声，我睡不下去了。
