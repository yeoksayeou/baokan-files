Comrade Chairman Chivu Stoica, dear comrades of the Romanian government delegation, dear Ambassador, comrades, friends:

The government delegation of the Romanian People's Republic, headed by Comrade Chivu Stoica, has been visiting our country for eight days. In this short period, the delegation has visited some of our cities, factories, agricultural production cooperatives, and scenic spots with tireless enthusiasm. The delegation has had cordial meetings with the people of our country in Beijing and other places. These friendly activities have left a deep and unforgettable impression on the Chinese people. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to once again express my heartfelt thanks to them for their great contribution to further enhancing the fraternal friendship between our two peoples.

In the past few days, the leaders of our two governments have held cordial and sincere talks, and based on the results of the talks, a joint statement of the two governments was issued this afternoon. The talks and the statement fully demonstrate that our two governments have completely一致 views on the current major international issues, on further strengthening the unity and cooperation of socialist countries, and on the friendly and mutual assistance between our two countries. The Chinese people, like the Romanian people, will continue to make unremitting efforts to safeguard world peace and build our common cause of socialism.

The Romanian government delegation is about to visit Northeast China, and then go to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Mongolian People's Republic for friendly visits. We are deeply convinced that, like their visits to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and our country, their visits to these two brotherly countries will surely be a complete success.

The cause of our socialist family will surely become more prosperous and developed day by day.

Dear Comrade Chivu Stoica, your visit will be a new milestone in the ever-developing friendly relations between China and Romania. The Chinese people will never forget that just as our people across the country are building socialism with great confidence and firm steps, with all-out efforts, striving for the top, and building socialism in a more, faster, better and more economical way, you have brought us the fraternal friendship of the Romanian people and encouragement and support for our construction cause.

Comrades, friends, I propose:

To the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples,

To the great unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union,

To the friendship of the people of all countries in the world,

To the health of the leading comrades of the Romanian Workers' Party and government headed by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Maurer, and Chivu Stoica!

Cheers!

    在罗马尼亚驻华大使举行的招待会上
    周恩来总理的讲话亲爱的基伏·斯托伊卡主席同志，亲爱的罗马尼亚政府代表团的全体同志们，亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    以基伏·斯托伊卡同志为首的罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团在我国已经进行了八天的访问。在这短短的时间里，代表团以不倦的热情参观和访问了我国的一些城市、工厂、农业生产合作社和名胜古迹。代表团在北京和其他各地同我国人民进行了亲切的会见。这些友好活动给中国人民留下了深刻难忘的印象。我现在代表中国政府和人民再一次向他们表示衷心的感谢，感谢他们为进一步增进我们两国人民的兄弟友谊所做的巨大贡献。
    在过去的这几天中，我们两国政府领导人进行了亲切和诚挚的会谈，并且根据会谈的结果在今天下午发表了两国政府的联合声明。会谈和声明充分表明，我们两国政府对当前重大国际问题、对进一步加强社会主义各国的团结合作和我们两国的友好互助关系具有完全一致的看法。中国人民同罗马尼亚人民一样，将继续为维护世界和平和建设社会主义的共同事业进行不懈的努力。
    罗马尼亚政府代表团就要去我国东北参观，然后前往朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国进行友好访问。我们深信，如同他们在越南民主共和国和我国的访问一样，他们在这两个兄弟国家的访问一定也会获得圆满的成功。
    我们社会主义各国大家庭的事业一定会一天比一天更加繁荣，更加发展。
    亲爱的基伏·斯托伊卡同志，你们这次的访问在中罗两国日益发展的友好关系中将是一个新的标志。中国人民将永远不会忘记，正当我们全国人民以巨大的信心和坚定的步伐，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义的时候，你们给我们带来了罗马尼亚人民的兄弟友情和对于我国建设事业的鼓舞和支持。
    同志们，朋友们，我提议：
    为中罗两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义各国的伟大团结，
    为世界各国人民的友好，
    为以乔治乌—德治、毛雷尔、基伏·斯托伊卡为首的罗马尼亚工人党和政府的领导同志们的健康
    干杯！
