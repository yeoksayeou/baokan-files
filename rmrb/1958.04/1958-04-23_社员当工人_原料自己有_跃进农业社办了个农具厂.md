Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 21st: The Leap Forward Agricultural Cooperative in Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, has established a factory for improved farm tools.

The factory began production on the 18th. The first batch of trial products, including rice cultivators, wheat harvesters, and other varieties, are all urgently needed for current agricultural activities. According to the factory's preliminary plan, over one hundred and ten types of products will be trial-produced this year, ensuring that every commune member has an improved farm tool.

The factory currently has ironworking and woodworking workshops, with over sixty workers who are all commune members skilled in ironworking and woodworking techniques. The factory's mission is to create and promote improved farm tools suitable for local conditions. To improve production levels, the factory has established a technical research group and an experimental group, and plans to send workers to visit and learn from farm tool factories in other areas.

The factory building is an empty house belonging to the cooperative, and all production tools were brought by the workers themselves. The raw materials needed for production, except for coal and steel which need to be purchased on the market, such as bamboo and wood, are all self-sufficient. So far, the agricultural cooperative has only invested eighty yuan in the purchase of raw materials.

The Xuyong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to widely promote the experience of the Leap Forward Cooperative throughout the county.

    社员当工人　原料自己有
    跃进农业社办了个农具厂
    新华社成都21日电　四川叙永县跃进农业社办起了一座改良农具工厂。
    这个工厂已在18日开工生产，第一批试制的水稻中耕器、小麦收割器等多种产品，都是当前农事活动中迫切需要的。按照工厂初步计划，今年将试制一百一十多种产品，使全体社员每人都有一件改良农具。
    这座工厂目前有铁工、木工两个车间，六十多名工人都是熟习铁工、木工技术的社员。工厂的任务是创造和推广当地适用的改良农具。为了提高生产水平，厂内设有技术研究组和试验组，还准备派工人到外地农具工厂参观学习。
    工厂的厂房是社里的一幢空屋子，全部生产工具都是工人们自己带来的。生产所需要的原料，除煤炭和钢铁要在市场采购以外，竹、木等材料全部由自己解决。到目前为止，农业社只在购买原料上投资了八十元。
    中共叙永县委已决定在全县普遍推广跃进社的经验。
