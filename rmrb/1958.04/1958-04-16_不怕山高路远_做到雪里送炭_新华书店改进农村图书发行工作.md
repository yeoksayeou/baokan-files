    Not Afraid of High Mountains and Long Roads, Delivering Coal in the Snow:
    Xinhua Bookstore Improves Rural Book Distribution

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Under the impetus of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the rural book distribution work of Xinhua Bookstores across the country has also taken a leap forward. Since last winter and this spring, in order to actively cooperate with socialist education in rural areas and promote the great leap forward in agricultural production, Xinhua Bookstores in various places have generally strengthened the distribution of popular political and ideological readings, agricultural production experience, and books on production technology.

    Since the end of January, Xinhua Bookstores in Hubei Province have launched a sales campaign for the twenty-seven types of agricultural high-yield experience books compiled by the Provincial Party Committee. In just forty days, 2.7 million copies of agricultural production experience books were sold, setting the highest record for agricultural book distribution in the province's history. Some agricultural cooperatives in Hongan County reflected: "The leap forward in production cannot be separated from advanced experience. The bookstore delivered these books to the cooperatives in a timely and proactive manner, truly delivering coal in the snow." Many provinces and cities, such as Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and Beijing, have also recently distributed a large number of agricultural production experience books based on local needs.

    At present, the staff of Xinhua Bookstores in various places are full of energy. The slogans they have put forward are: "Sell more good books, speed up book circulation, ensure good quality and effectiveness, and save on distribution costs." "Not afraid of high mountains and long roads, not afraid of rain, snow, wind, and cold, we must ensure that books go to the countryside and up the mountains." Many bookstore managers have personally taken the lead in going to the countryside to sell books. Some areas have also learned advanced distribution experience and plan to increase the distribution of popular agricultural books by five to ten times compared to last year. The total sales volume of general books should be doubled compared to last year. Xinhua Bookstores in twenty-four counties (cities) including Hongan and Wenshui have jointly submitted a great leap forward competition letter to Xinhua Bookstores across the country. The competition letter not only puts forward the most advanced distribution quantity indicators, but also aims to ensure that every meeting is attended, every book is delivered, every township has a book selling point (relying on social forces), and every cooperative sees the results of distribution. Within this year, significant distribution results should be found in each agricultural cooperative. The Xinhua Bookstore General Store plans to especially emphasize the actual distribution effect in the great leap forward in distribution work, so as to completely overcome the long-standing non-political tendencies in rural book distribution work in the past.

    不怕山高路远　做到雪里送炭
    新华书店改进农村图书发行工作
    本报讯　在农业生产大跃进的新形势推动下，全国新华书店的农村图书发行工作，也跃进了一步。去冬今春以来，各地新华书店为了积极配合农村社会主义教育、促进农业生产大跃进，普遍加强了通俗政治思想读物、农业生产经验和生产技术方面书籍的发行工作。
    湖北省各地新华书店自1月下旬起，开展了以省委编写的二十七种农业丰产经验书籍的推销运动。在仅仅四十天的时间中，就销售了农业生产经验书籍二百七十万册，创该省历年来农业书籍发行量的最高纪录。红安县的一些农业社反映：生产跃进离不开先进经验，书店及时主动地把这些书送到社里，真是雪里送炭。河北、山西、河南、北京等许多省市，在最近时期，也都根据当地实际需要，大量发行了农业生产经验书籍。
    目前，各地新华书店的工作人员干劲十足，他们提出的口号是：“好书销的多，图书流通快，质量效果好，发行费用省”。“不怕山高路远、不怕雨雪风寒，一定要使书籍下乡上山”。许多书店经理都亲自带头下乡卖书。有些地区的工作人员，还学习了先进的发行经验，计划今年对通俗农业书的发行量要较去年提高五倍至十倍。一般图书的总销售量要较去年翻一翻。红安、文水等二十四个县（市）的新华书店联名向全国各地新华书店提出了大跃进的竞赛书。竞赛书上不仅提出了最先进的发行数量指标，而且要做到，有会必赶，有书必送，乡乡有卖书点（靠社会力量），社社见发行结果。年内，要在每一个农业社里，都能找到一件或几件显著的发行效果。新华书店总店准备在发行工作大跃进中，特别强调实际发行效果，以便彻底克服过去在农村图书发行工作中长期存在的非政治倾向。
