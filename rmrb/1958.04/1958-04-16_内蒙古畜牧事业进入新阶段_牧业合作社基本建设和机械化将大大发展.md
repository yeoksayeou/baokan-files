Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 15th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commenting on the great leap forward in animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region said: "Toiling hard for three years to fundamentally change the face of pastoral areas" has become the action slogan of the people in Inner Mongolia's pastoral areas.

One of the characteristics of the Great Leap Forward is that the pastoral collectivization has entered a new stage of planned development. In 1958, the pastoral areas will develop 940 cooperatives and 40 joint state-private pastoral farms. The number of herding households joining the cooperatives will reach 50% of the total number of herding households in the pastoral areas. Inner Mongolia began to experiment with pastoral cooperatives in 1952, experienced a major development in 1956, and underwent comprehensive consolidation in 1957. In the two years of severe snow disasters and droughts, the cooperatives demonstrated outstanding superiority. According to statistics from 245 pastoral cooperatives in the autonomous region last year, livestock increased in 70% of the cooperatives and remained stable in 18%. In the pastoral cooperatives of the Xilin Gol League, livestock increased by a net 8% last year, year-round mutual aid teams increased by a net 3%, while individual herders, unable to resist disasters, actually declined by 1%-3%. All 632 cooperatives and 15 joint state-private pastoral farms have been consolidated, with none collapsing. The socialist education in the pastoral areas, which began in the autumn and winter of 1957, greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the people in the pastoral areas to take the socialist road. More than 80% of the herders resolutely support the Party's collectivization policy, and more than 50% of the mutual aid teams that have already been organized are actively demanding to organize cooperatives. The development of mutual aid and cooperation in recent years has also accumulated preliminary experience in leadership, and more than 1,500 cadres of various ethnic groups in the pastoral areas have learned how to run cooperatives. All of these have created favorable conditions for the development of pastoral cooperatives this year.

The second characteristic of the Great Leap Forward is that the basic construction of animal husbandry production in pastoral areas has begun to develop significantly, and the unstable state of animal husbandry production will be fundamentally changed within three to five years. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has formulated four plans for developing water conservancy in pastoral areas, improving grasslands, preventing epidemics, and improving breeds, and has already begun to implement them. According to these plans, within three to five years, waterless grasslands in pastoral areas will be eliminated, ensuring that livestock have sufficient feed and fodder for the winter, gradually realizing zoned rotational grazing, controlling diseases that seriously harm livestock, and improving livestock such as cattle, horses, and sheep. Some pastoral areas will be able to basically avoid the threat of drought this year. The work of grassland improvement will be carried out on a large scale this year in three types of areas: lush grasslands, barren grasslands, and desert and semi-desert areas. In terms of preventing and controlling animal epidemics, in addition to carrying out mass epidemic prevention campaigns, the more than 700 veterinary prevention and control institutions that have been established throughout the region are currently actively carrying out veterinary epidemic prevention and control work. The work of improving livestock breeds is being accelerated, and this year, Xinjiang fine-wool sheep, Soviet Caucasian fine-wool sheep, etc., will be used for crossbreeding and improvement of 2 million sheep.

The third characteristic of the Great Leap Forward is that measures for the mechanization of animal husbandry are being actively planned. Industry, finance, and commerce have also taken active measures to support pastoral areas. Following the establishment of China's first grassland tractor station in the autonomous region last year, two more grassland tractor stations are now under construction. Along with the equipment of grassland improvement work stations and feed bases, a large number of tractors and automobiles will be transferred to pastoral areas this year. Local industry has begun to supply pastoral areas with a large number of machines such as hay mowers, milk separators, and wool shearing machines. Equipment for wind-powered water pumping and power generation on the grasslands is also being actively planned. Among the 109 economic centers established in the pastoral areas, 39 will build or add a number of small-scale industries and handicrafts this year. The purchase of dairy products, animal products, animal by-products, and pastoral sideline products will also be greatly strengthened.

On the basis of pastoral collectivization, settling nomadic herders will be vigorously promoted this year, and cultural, educational, and health work in pastoral areas will be further strengthened.

The fourth characteristic of the Great Leap Forward is that livestock in agricultural areas will also develop rapidly. According to existing materials, the number of livestock such as cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, and sheep in agricultural and semi-agricultural areas will generally increase by a net 15% this year. There is a major leap forward in pig production. According to the plans revised at the on-site meetings on pig production held in Hangjinhou Banner and Tongliao County respectively, the total number of pigs in the region will increase from 1.6 million to more than 7.9 million in 1958. The collective livestock herds of cooperatives will also experience tremendous development.

At present, based on the conditions in various aspects and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the vast number of herders, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China requires that the number of livestock in the region increase by 10% to 12% each year. According to this calculation, within five years, the autonomous region's livestock will reach 35 million to 40 million head, nearly double the current number.

    内蒙古畜牧事业进入新阶段
    牧业合作社基本建设和机械化将大大发展
    新华社呼和浩特15日电　新华社记者评述内蒙古自治区畜牧业大跃进的形势说：“苦战三年，基本改变牧区面貌”已经成为内蒙古牧区人民的行动口号。
    大跃进的特点之一，是牧业合作化进入了一个有计划发展的新阶段。在1958年内，牧区将发展九百四十个合作社，四十个公私合营牧场。入社牧户将达到牧区总牧户的50％。内蒙古1952年就开始试办牧业合作社，1956年有一个大发展，1957年进行了全面的巩固。在两年大雪灾和大旱灾中，合作社显示了突出的优越性。去年据自治区二百四十五个牧业社统计，牲畜增加的占70％，平户的占18％。锡林郭勒盟的牧业社，去年牲畜纯增8％，常年互助组纯增3％，单干牧民因无力抗灾，反而下降了1％—3％。六百三十二个合作社和十五个公私合营牧场全部巩固起来，没有一个垮台的。从1957年秋、冬开始的牧区社会主义教育，大大鼓舞了牧区人民走社会主义道路的积极性。80％以上的牧民坚决拥护党的合作化政策，已经组织起来的互助组中，有50％以上积极要求组织合作社。几年来发展互助合作的结果，在领导方面也已经积累了初步的经验，在牧区已有一千五百多名各民族干部学会了办社。这些，都为今年牧业合作社的发展创造了良好的条件。
    大跃进的特点之二，是牧区畜牧业生产的基本建设开始有重大发展，畜牧业生产不稳定的状态，在三、五年之内，将要基本改观。内蒙古自治区已经制定了发展牧区水利、改良草原、防止疫病、改良品种等四个规划，并已经开始实施。按照这些规划，三、五年之内要消灭牧区的无水草原，做到牲畜过冬有充足的饲料饲草，并逐渐实现划区轮牧，控制危害牲畜严重的疾病，改良牛、马、羊等牲畜。一部分牧区，今年就可以基本避免旱灾的威胁。草原改良的工作，今年分丰美草原、贫瘠草原和沙漠半沙漠三类地区大规模的进行。在防治畜疫方面，除开展群众性的防疫运动外，全区已建立起的七百多个兽医防治机构，目前已积极开展了兽疫防治工作。改良牲畜品种工作正在加紧筹备，今年将用新疆细毛羊、苏联高加索细毛羊等，进行二百万只羊的杂交改良。
    大跃进的特点之三，是畜牧业机械化的措施正在积极筹划。工业、财政、商业对牧区的支援也已采取了积极措施。继去年在自治区建成的我国第一个草原拖拉机站，现在又有两个草原拖拉机站正在兴建，连同草原改良工作站和饲料基地的设备，今年有大批拖拉机和汽车调入牧区。地方工业开始供应牧区大量的打搂草机、牛奶分离机、剪毛机等机械。草原上风动抽水、发电的设备，也正在积极筹划。牧区已建立的一百零九个经济中心点，有三十九个点今年还新建和增建一批小型工业和手工业。乳制品、畜产品、畜产废品、牧区副业产品的收购工作，也要大大加强。
    在牧业合作化的基础上，今年要大力推行定居游牧，并进一步加强牧区的文教、卫生工作。
    大跃进的特点之四，是农业区的牲畜也将有迅速发展。据现有材料，农业区半农半牧区的牛、马、驴、骡、羊等牲畜，今年一般都能纯增15％左右。猪的生产有一个大的跃进。据在杭锦后旗和通辽县两地分别召开的全区生猪生产现场会议所修订的计划，全区生猪在1958年度，将从一百六十万口发展到七百九十多万口。合作社的公有畜群，也将有巨大发展。
    目前，根据各方面的条件，和广大牧民的革命干劲，中共内蒙古自治区委员会要求全区牲畜头数每年递增10％到12％。照此计算，五年之内自治区牲畜将达到三千五百万到四千万头，比现在将近增加一倍。
