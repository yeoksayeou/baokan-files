    Long Sacks and Soft Chicken Incense:
    Hainan Island's Wild Fibers Are Abundant and Good
    (Our dispatch from Guangzhou, April 21st) A wild fiber resource development investigation team, organized by relevant departments in Guangdong Province, is conducting in-depth investigations and research on Hainan Island. Among the wild fiber plants already discovered, there are extensive patches of Sacks, producing a large yield. This type of hemp has been found in Ledong, Lingshui, and other counties in the southern part of Hainan Island, centered around Yaxian, as well as in Baisha, Nada, and Changgan in the western region, centered around Dongfang. The quality is generally good, and the bark can be harvested once a year. The hemp bark typically reaches a length of over one meter and can be used as raw material for blended woven fabrics and rope, among other products.

    The investigation also uncovered a wild fiber plant called "Chicken Incense" (belonging to the Thymelaeaceae family). The bark fiber is exceptionally soft, delicate, and possesses high tensile strength. It has been found in the northeastern hilly regions of Hainan Island and near Sanya Port in Yaxian.

    Hainan Island, situated in a subtropical zone, enjoys evergreen conditions year-round, resulting in abundant wild fiber plant resources. The annual yield of wild red cotton (Kapok) discovered in earlier years alone reaches seven to eight thousand dan [approximately 350-400 tons].

    索麻长　鸡香软
    海南岛野生纤维又多又好
    本报广州21日电　广东省有关部门组成的野生纤维资源开发调查组，正在海南岛进行深入调查研究。在已经发现的这些野生纤维植物中，有生长连片，产量很大的索麻，这种麻在以崖县为中心的海南岛南部的乐东、陵水等县，和以东方为中心的西部白沙、那大、昌感等地区都有发现，而且质量都较好，每年可以割皮一次，麻皮长度一般都达一公尺以上，可以混纺织布以及绳索等其他制品原料。
    这次调查中还发现了一种叫鸡香的野生纤维植物（属瑞香科），皮的纤维十分柔软、细致，拉力也很强，在海南岛的东北部丘陵地区和崖县三亚港附近都有发现。
    海南岛地处亚热带地区，四季常青，野生纤维植物资源丰富。其中仅早年已发现的野生红棉（即木棉）年产量即达七、八千担。
