    "Ten Thousand Year Fertilizer"
    In Hunan Province, there is a kind of wild grass called *shaocao* (芍草), which farmers also call "Ten Thousand Year Fertilizer." It is a good green manure newly discovered by Tian Qifa, director of the Sui Feng Agricultural Cooperative in Nanxian County, Hunan Province (National Model for High Rice Yield). This year, Nanxian County planted over 74,000 mu.
    *Shaocao* is a kind of wild green manure, found everywhere along the banks of Dongting Lake, especially near houses, latrine pits, fences, and abandoned dikes. It has thick stems, large and tender leaves, and is dark green in color, growing to about the height of a person.
    This grass is easy to cultivate and easily survives. Transplanting can begin after the Beginning of Spring (立春). It is best to apply some base fertilizer during transplanting to promote rapid rooting and survival.
    *Shaocao* has a high yield. It can be cut four times a year, around the Clear and Bright Festival (清明), Minor Heat (小暑), Beginning of Autumn (立秋), and Frost's Descent (霜降). Each time, approximately 4,000 jin can be harvested per mu. If some fertilizer is applied after each cutting, the yield will be even higher.
    *Shaocao* has a very high fertilizer effect. In the past, some farmers used it in rice seedling fields or taro fields. According to tests by the Hunan Agricultural College, its fertilizer effect is higher than that of red clover and blue clover. Now, all barren land and gaps in the county have been planted with *shaocao*. It is estimated that each mu of the county's more than 700,000 mu of paddy fields can increase fertilizer by more than 200 dan.

    “万年肥”
    湖南省有一种野草叫芍草，农民又称他为“万年肥”，是湖南省南县岁丰农业社主任田启发（全国水稻丰产模范）新发现的一种好绿肥。南县今年共栽了七万四千多亩。
    芍草，是一种野生绿肥，洞庭湖滨到处都有，尤以屋场旁、吊坑上、篱笆旁、废堤上为最多。它茎粗叶大质嫩，呈深绿色，长成后高约一人许。
    这种草培育方法简单，又易成活，立春后就可以开始移植。移植时最好下一点基肥，能生根快、成活快。
    芍草产量很高，每到清明、小暑、立秋、霜降前后砍一次，全年可砍四次。每次每亩可砍四千斤左右，如果在每次砍后追施一点肥料，产量将会更高。
    芍草肥效很高，过去也有农民采用施秧田或芋头田。据湖南农学院化验，肥效比红花草子和蓝花草子都高。现在全县所有荒坪隙地都栽上了芍草，预计全县七十多万水田每亩可增加肥料二百多担。
