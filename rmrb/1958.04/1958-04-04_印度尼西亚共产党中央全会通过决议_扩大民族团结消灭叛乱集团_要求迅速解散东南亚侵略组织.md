Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 2nd. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party unanimously passed a resolution on the 1st, expressing agreement with the report of the Party's General Secretary, Aidit. The resolution believes that Aidit's report provides correct answers to various political and organizational issues that have emerged during the period from the Fifth Plenary Session to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Indonesian Communist Party, and points out new guidelines for future work.

The resolution is divided into four parts. The first part points out that in recent times, the situation in Indonesia has become much more favorable to the people than before. The resolution expresses support for the statement of Army Chief of Staff Nasution, which is: The current action program of the Indonesian people is to "expel Dutch colonialism and remove their influence and their accomplices from Indonesian soil."

The resolution also stipulates that the party's task is to "redouble efforts through various channels, continue to develop progressive forces, expand and consolidate national unity, and improve the combat effectiveness and vigilance of the people across the country."

This part of the resolution believes that some recent events in Indonesia prove that the Moscow Declaration's view that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization poses a danger of war in Southeast Asia is correct. The resolution lists facts to prove that member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, through the means of assisting rebel groups with various weapons, have openly and brutally interfered in Indonesia's internal affairs.

The resolution points out that this not only exposes the aggressive nature of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, but also shows how dangerous the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is if we do not rise up against this group and demand its immediate dissolution.

The second part of the resolution points out that the three elections of the Parliament, the Constituent Assembly, and the local councils show that the will of the Indonesian people is in line with President Sukarno's program and runs counter to the anti-communist policy. The resolution states that the primary task of everyone who serves the people and democracy is to defend, consolidate, and expand the political freedom of the Indonesian people.

The third part of the resolution states that the basic tasks of the Indonesian people at present are to eliminate the "Revolutionary Government," the economic power of Dutch capitalists, eradicate subversion, and prepare to cope with the possibility of imperialist armed aggression. Promoting cooperation between the armed forces and the people is a condition for achieving these tasks.

The fourth part of the resolution concerns the party's tasks and some issues.

At the meeting on the 1st, a letter of thanks was also passed, expressing gratitude to the world proletariat and working people for the support given by the communist parties of various countries to Indonesia's struggle for the liberation of West Irian.

The meeting also established three subcommittees, responsible for drafting resolutions on issues such as rice, the subversive activities of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The meeting on the 1st was adjourned after hearing a report from Sutisman, the head of the delegation of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party who attended the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

    印度尼西亚共产党中央全会通过决议
    扩大民族团结消灭叛乱集团
    要求迅速解散东南亚侵略组织
    新华社雅加达2日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第六次全体会议在1日一致通过决议，表示同意党的总书记艾地的报告。决议认为，艾地的报告对印度尼西亚共产党五中全会到六中全会这一期间所出现的各种政治问题和组织问题提供了正确的答案，并且指出了今后工作的新方针。
    决议共分四部分。第一部分指出，最近时期以来，印度尼西亚的局势已经比以前对人民有利得多。决议表示支持陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安的声明，这就是：目前印度尼西亚人民的行动纲领就是要“驱逐荷兰殖民主义者，从印度尼西亚土地上清除他们的影响和他们的帮凶”。
    决议还规定了党的任务是要“通过各种途径加倍努力，继续发展进步力量，扩大和巩固民族团结，并且提高全国人民的战斗性和警惕性”。
    决议的这一部分认为，印度尼西亚最近发生的一些事件，证明莫斯科宣言所指出的东南亚条约组织造成东南亚战争危险的看法是正确的。决议列举事实证明东南亚条约组织的成员国、通过用各种武器帮助叛乱集团的手段，公开而粗暴地干涉了印度尼西亚的内政。
    决议指出，这不仅暴露了东南亚条约组织的侵略本质，而且也说明，如果不起来反对这个集团，并且要求它迅速解散，东南亚条约组织是多么危险。
    决议的第二部分指出，国会、制宪议会和地方议会的三次选举说明，印度尼西亚人民的意愿是同苏加诺总统的方案相符合，而且是同反共政策背道而驰的。决议说，每个为人民和民主服务的人，他的主要任务就是捍卫、巩固和扩大印度尼西亚人民的政治自由。
    决议的第三部分说，印度尼西亚人民目前的基本任务是消灭“革命政府”、荷兰大资本家的经济势力，根除颠覆活动，并且准备应付帝国主义武装进攻的可能性。促进武装部队和人民之间的合作就是实现这些任务的条件。
    决议的第四部分是关于党的任务和一些问题。
    1日会议上还通过了一封感谢信，向世界无产阶级和劳动人民在各国共产党的领导下对印度尼西亚争取解放西伊里安的斗争所给予的支持，表示感谢。
    会议还成立了三个小组委员会，责成它们分别起草关于大米、东南亚条约组织的颠覆活动和蒋介石集团等问题的决议。
    1日的会议在听取了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会参加十月革命四十周年庆祝典礼的代表团团长苏蒂斯曼的报告之后，宣布结束。
