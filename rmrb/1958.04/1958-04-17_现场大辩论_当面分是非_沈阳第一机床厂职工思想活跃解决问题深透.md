On-site Debates Distinguish Right from Wrong Face to Face
Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant Employees are Ideologically Active and Solve Problems Thoroughly
    Our newspaper, Shenyang, 16th dispatch: Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant uses the working method of the mass line, boldly mobilizing the masses, launching "on-site debates," and quickly and effectively solving some major problems, promoting an all-round great leap forward in production, ideology, and leadership style. The CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee and the Liaoning Provincial Committee both believe that this is a good experience for quickly and effectively handling the tens of thousands of opinions raised by the masses in the Double-Anti Movement. In mid-to-late March, the Liaoning Provincial Committee successively held on-site meetings at the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, organizing secretaries and industrial ministers from various municipal and prefectural committees and some factories and mines to learn from their practices.
    The "on-site debates" of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant originated from the great debate between the Third Workshop and the Inspection Section. In January and February, the cast iron sleeves made by the Third Workshop were all judged as waste products by the Inspection Section. The workers in the workshop believed that the same parts were qualified last year, but this year they are being scrapped, which is unreasonable. Although they reasoned with the Inspection Section several times, the problem was not resolved. After the start of the Double-Anti Movement, the workers exhibited these "waste products," issued battle letters inviting the Inspection Section to the workshop for debate, and invited the factory director, chief engineer, and relevant departments to participate. After three rounds of debate, the various reasons for scrapping put forward by the Inspection Section were all refuted. The Inspection Section had to withdraw the original judgment on the spot and examined the serious authoritative thinking and the bureaucratic style of "whatever I say goes." After this debate, the workers saw that this method could really solve problems, and they also raised major problems in their own units that they felt were difficult to solve, issued battle letters to relevant departments or workshops, and many mass "on-site debates" quickly unfolded throughout the factory.
    The biggest characteristic of the "on-site debates" in the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is that they are closely combined with physical objects, charts, cartoons, performances, experiments, presenting facts, and reasoning, which is lively and effective in solving problems. The experience of saving steel with "shallow hole blanking" was not promoted in the 1A62 workshop for one or two years. This time, the Process Section took the initiative to request a debate with the 1A62 workshop: Why didn't the workshop promote the "shallow hole blanking" experience? After the Process Section failed to persuade the workshop with words, they started the machine on the spot and refuted the workshop's reasons with compelling facts, making an experience that had not been promoted for one or two years fully promoted at once. The problems debated were not raised by the leadership, but the workers themselves identified major problems hindering the leap forward in production and issued battle letters requesting relevant departments to debate and resolve them. Starting from debate and exposing facts, the issues were gradually clarified and summarized to ideological style, and the problems were thoroughly addressed.
    Every "on-site debate" carried out by the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has yielded considerable gains in production, ideology, and leadership style. In February, the workers in the Third Workshop only completed an average of 80% of the newly set quota. After debating with the Inspection Section, in March, many workers actively improved their tools and operating methods, breaking through the new quota by 20% to 50%. After the Process Section and the 1A62 workshop debated, not only did the 1A62 workshop promote the "shallow hole blanking" experience, increasing the steel utilization rate from 49% to 56% in the past; the technicians in the Process Section also examined their mass-line style of only asking the workshop to promote advanced experience but rarely helping workers solve difficulties, and immediately took action to cooperate closely with the workers. The "deep hole blanking" experience, which had not been successfully tested for several years, has now been successfully tested and promoted. (Zhao Chunlie, Wang Dianxue)

    现场大辩论　当面分是非
    沈阳第一机床厂职工思想活跃解决问题深透
    本报沈阳16日电　沈阳第一机床厂运用群众路线的工作方法，大胆放手发动群众，展开“现场论战”，又快又好地解决了一些重大问题，促使生产、思想、领导作风全面大跃进。中共沈阳市委和辽宁省委都认为这是又快又好处理群众在双反运动中提出的数以万计的意见的好经验。3月中旬和下旬，辽宁省委先后在第一机床厂召开现场会议，组织各市委、地委和一些厂矿的书记、工业部长去学习他们的作法。
    沈阳第一机床厂的“现场论战”，创始于三车间与检查科间的大辩论。1、2月间，三车间做的铸铁套，都被检查科判定为废品。车间工人都认为同样的部件，在去年合格，今年就打废，不合理，虽然几次与检查科说理，但是，都没解决。在双反运动开始后，工人把这些“废品”展览出来，下战表邀检查科到车间来辩论，并请厂长、总工程师和有关科室参加。经过三个回合论战，检查科提出的各种作废理由个个被驳倒。检查科不得不当场撤消原判，并检查了严重的权威思想和说了就算的十足官风。经过这场论战，职工们看到这个方法真能解决问题，也都提出本单位感到难以解决的重大问题，向有关科室或车间下战表，许多群众性的“现场论战”，迅速的在全厂展开。
    沈阳第一机床厂“现场论战”的最大特点，是紧紧结合实物、图表、漫画、表演、试验、摆事实、讲道理，生动活泼，解决问题。“浅孔套料”节约钢材的经验，在一A六二车间一两年没有推广。这次工艺科主动要求和一A六二车间辩论：车间为什么不推广“浅孔套料”经验？工艺科在舌战不能说服车间后，当场把机床开动起来，用有力的事实驳倒车间的理由，使一项一两年没有推广的经验，一下子全面推广了。辩论的问题不是领导上提出的，而是职工群众自己找出阻碍生产跃进的重大问题，下战表要求有关部门辩论解决。由辩论、揭发事实开始，逐步明确归结到思想作风上去，问题搞得深透。
    沈阳第一机床厂开展的每个“现场论战”，都在生产、思想、领导作风上有不少的收获。2月份，三车间工人平均只完成新定额80％，与检查科辩论后，3月里，很多工人都积极改进工具和操作方法，突破新定额20％到50％。工艺科和一A六二车间经过辩论，不仅一A六二车间推广了“浅孔套料”经验，把钢材的利用率从过去的49％提高到56％；工艺科的技术人员也检查了只要求车间推广先进经验，却很少帮助工人解决困难的脱离群众作风，立即行动起来，和工人密切合作，几年没有试验成功的“深孔套料”经验，现在已试验成功推广了。　（赵春烈　王殿学）
