　　In the Great Leap Forward in production, the broad masses demonstrated a revolutionary drive to move mountains and drain seas. Some people say that this kind of drive is admirable, but it's just brute force, lacking technical innovation, and cannot be sustained. Is that really the case? Let's look at the facts.

　　In the Anyang area of Henan Province, just in finding mountain springs alone, the masses created and summarized twelve valuable experiences, fresh and vivid, easy to understand. For example, "Where the mountain turns its head, there is a great flow," "Two mountains plus a mouth, there must be a great water source," "A green mountain pressing a sandy mountain, there must be a mountain spring," etc., which are probably not found in many groundwater hydrology textbooks. The Chinese people are a nation known for their creativity, but for thousands of years, they have never been able to reach such a peak as today, nor was it possible. Zhuge Liang, Wu Yong, and other traditional examples of wisdom pale in comparison to today's masses, not to mention those "senior intellectuals" who fancy themselves above others. Furthermore, things like electricity and nylon are good modern things, but if we want 500 million farmers to enjoy them, how many hydroelectric and thermal power plants need to be built, how many modernized factories need to be set up, and how much capital, materials, and time will it take? Now the masses have found ways to achieve the modernization of life from many inexhaustible, ubiquitous, and inconspicuous things. Excrement, which people used to cover their noses when they saw it, has now become a priceless treasure. When made into biogas, it can bring light, warmth, and power to the vast countryside. Rice straw can be brewed into fine wine, made into cloth, and fluffed into soft bedding. Just these few small things can save the country so much coal, wood, gasoline, grain, and cotton, and can save so much capital for industrial construction. It is difficult to calculate this. Although these creations and discoveries are not astonishing, they come from the masses, arise from the needs of the struggle for production, and are therefore particularly vital and possess great mass character and practicality. This is something that many scientists and engineers sitting in laboratories and at drawing boards, and many theorists and cadres divorced from reality, cannot imagine.

　　These creations and discoveries of the masses are also an intangible, enormous force of spiritual revolution, which can destroy the old and establish the new, break down superstitions, and promote the great liberation of people's minds. It also presents a large number of fresh and lively topics for our philosophers, theorists, writers, and artists, forcing them to walk out of their studies, offices, and studios and plunge into the vortex of struggle to explore, research, and create.

　　History is written in this way. The labor and wisdom of the masses create material wealth, promote the Great Leap Forward in production, and at the same time promote the transformation of the superstructure and the production of spiritual wealth.

    智慧的海洋
    迟蓼洲
    在生产大跃进中，广大群众表现了移山倒海的革命干劲。有人说这种干劲是值得钦佩的，但这只是拼力气，没有技术创造，不能持久。真的如此吗？请看事实。
    河南安阳地区，仅仅找山泉这个问题，群众就创造总结了十二条珍贵经验，新鲜生动，通俗易懂。例如：“山扭头，有大流”，“两山加一嘴，必定有大水”，“青山压砂山，必定有山泉”等等，恐怕是许多地下水文教科书上都找不到的。中国人民，是以富有创造性著称的民族，几千年来，却从来没有也不可能达到今天这样的高峰。诸葛亮、吴用等那些传统的智慧的典型，与今天的群众相比，都要相形见拙，更不用说那些以“高级知识分子”自诩的梁上君子们了。又如电气、尼龙等等，是现代化很好的东西，可是要让五亿农民都享受到，需要建设多少水力、火力发电站，办多少装备现代化的工厂，要花多少资金、物力和时间啊。现在群众却从许多取之不尽用之不竭、到处都有的不起眼的东西里，找到了实现生活现代化的途径。粪便，人们见了要掩鼻而过的，现在成了无价之宝，制成沼气，就可以给广大农村带来光明、温暖和动力。稻草，能酿成美酒，制成布匹，弹成软和的絮被。仅仅这么几项小事情，可以为国家节省多少煤炭、木材、汽油、粮食和棉花，可以为工业建设节省多少资金，这笔账是很难算清的。尽管这些创造发现，貌不惊人，但它们来自群众，出于生产斗争的需要，就格外富有生命力，并且具有极大的群众性和现实性。这是许多坐在实验室里、制图板前的科学家和工程师，许多脱离实际的理论家和干部所不能想像的。
    群众的这些创造发现，还是一种无形的巨大的精神革命的力量，可以摧枯拉朽，破除迷信，促进人们的思想大解放，也给我们的哲学家、理论家、文学艺术家们出了一大堆新鲜活泼的题目，迫使他们走出书斋、办公室、创作室，投身到斗争的漩涡中去，进行摸索、研究和创作。
    历史就是这样写成的。群众的劳动和智慧，创造着物质财富，推进着生产大跃进，同时又推动上层建筑的变革和精神财富的生产。
