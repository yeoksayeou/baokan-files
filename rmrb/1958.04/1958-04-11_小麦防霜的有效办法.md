Effective Methods for Frost Prevention in Wheat
Director of the Agrometeorology Research Office, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lü Jiong

Since late March this year, the climate has been very abnormal. Cold air masses from the north have repeatedly moved southward, and the minimum temperature in North China has dropped below 0 degrees Celsius, causing frost damage to wheat.

The occurrence of spring frost is mainly due to the southward invasion of cold air currents from Siberia or further north. To do a good job in frost prevention, we must maintain close contact with meteorological observatories in various regions to obtain frost or cold wave warnings at any time. After receiving a frost warning, it is important to clarify whether the temperature drop forecast issued by the meteorological observatory refers to the minimum temperature inside the Stevenson screen or the minimum temperature close to the ground. This is a very important question. Generally, the temperature drop forecast issued by meteorological observatories refers to the temperature drop inside the Stevenson screen, which is about two meters above the ground. However, the minimum temperature inside the Stevenson screen at night is not the minimum temperature experienced by wheat on the ground. That is to say, when the minimum temperature inside the Stevenson screen is still above 5 degrees Celsius, the minimum temperature near the ground may have already reached -5 degrees Celsius.

Speaking of frost prevention measures, there are many methods (refer to the frost prevention knowledge published by the National Popular Science Publishing House), but only the following three can be widely used in large fields:

Irrigation Method

Irrigating farmland before the spring frost arrives is extremely beneficial for frost prevention. Water is like a large bank for storing heat. When there is too much heat in the air, it can absorb and store the external heat; when there is a lack of heat in the air, it can easily release heat. Therefore, if there is more moisture in the soil, it will not cause a sudden drop or rise in the air temperature near the ground. When encountering cold waves, it can greatly reduce frost damage. If well water is used for irrigation, the effect is even better, because in early spring, the temperature of well water is much higher than the temperature of the air.

The irrigation method can also increase the amount of water vapor in the air, thereby increasing the humidity of the air and raising the dew point, that is, raising the temperature at which water vapor reaches saturation and begins to condense. Because water vapor releases latent heat when it condenses, it can prevent the temperature from continuing to drop. In addition, water vapor can absorb the heat radiation from the ground, slowing down the heat dissipation from the ground and thus reducing frost damage to plants.

Spraying Method

One or two hours before frost arrives, fill a sprayer with water and spray the water on the stems and leaves of the crops so that the stems and leaves are just moistened like a light dew. Before the water dries or freezes into a thin layer of ice, spray a second time. Continue this until the sun rises the next day, which also has a great effect on frost prevention.

How often should it be sprayed? This depends on the situation. If the frost is severe, the number of sprays should be increased; if the frost is mild, the number of sprays can be reduced. It is estimated that spraying two to four times per hour is sufficient. The amount of water used for spraying is much less than the amount of water used for irrigation. It is estimated that the amount of water needed for spraying one mu of land in one night should not exceed two hundred catties.

Smoking Method

Smoking for frost prevention is an old method in our country. There are relevant records in Jia Sixie's "Qi Min Yao Shu" written in the Later Wei Dynasty. The thicker the smoke produced during smoking, the better. The thick smoke spreads in the air close to the ground, which can reduce the upward radiation of heat from the ground and prevent the heat from dissipating easily, thus protecting crops and reducing frost damage. In addition, when the smoke pile burns, it can also warm the air layer near the ground. During smoking, water vapor is easily condensed on the rising smoke particles, releasing latent heat of vaporization. The ground radiation at night is also weakened for the above reasons, so the ground temperature and the temperature in the air layer close to the ground can be slightly increased. Smoking should start one or two hours before the ground temperature reaches freezing point and continue until one or two hours after the sun rises above the ground. This can prevent crops from being suddenly exposed to sunlight after being attacked by the cold air in the morning, which can aggravate frost damage under sudden cold and heat.

However, the smoking method is not as good as irrigation and spraying methods. Because the effect of smoking is not very significant, it can only raise the temperature by one or two degrees. When the temperature is too low, smoking will not have any effect. Secondly, the smoking method requires a certain amount of ground space, for example, three to five smoke piles are needed per mu of land. Furthermore, the smoking method requires too much manpower, which is less labor-saving than irrigation and spraying. Moreover, the smoking technology is not easy to master. If it burns too quickly and turns into a fire pile, it cannot maintain a certain period of time, wasting fuel in vain. Smoking cannot play a role when the wind is slightly strong. Therefore, the smoking method must be used with caution. In areas where fuel or manpower is insufficient, or before the technology is fully mastered, it is advisable not to use it easily.

In addition, some areas have methods for pulling frost, using ropes or bamboo poles to pull or knock off the dew or frost crystals on the wheat stems and leaves. This method must be absolutely prohibited. Because pulling frost can only increase frost damage, and the mechanical damage to wheat after being pulled and beaten is very serious.

In order to basically prevent frost, in areas where spring frost frequently occurs, roughly from the end of March to the beginning of April, in places where water sources are sufficient, irrigation can be carried out more than once (irrigating the day before the frost has the greatest effect), plus fertilization. If farm manure, such as cattle and horse manure, is applied, the effect will be even better. Because the application of farm manure can not only enhance the frost resistance of wheat under mild frost, but also promote the growth of tillers in severe frost. Moreover, farm manure is easy to ferment and generate heat, which can also slightly increase the temperature of the ground.

    小麦防霜的有效办法
    中国农业科学院农业气象研究室主任　吕炯
    今年3月下旬以来，气候很不正常，北方的冷气团屡屡南下，华北各地最低气温曾降至摄氏零度以下，小麦已遭受霜冻影响。
    春间霜冻的发生主要是由于西伯利亚或更北地方冷气流南下侵袭所致。为了做好防霜工作，就必须和各地区气象台保持密切联系，以便随时得到霜冻警报或寒潮警报。在接到霜冻警报之后，应该弄清楚气象台发出的降温预报，是指百叶箱内最低温度的数字呢，还是指紧贴地面的最低温度数字，这是一个很重要的问题。因为一般气象台上所发出的降温预报，是指离开地面大约二公尺高的百叶箱内温度降低的情形，但是夜间百叶箱里的最低温度，还不是地面小麦所遭受的最低温度。就是说：百叶箱里的最低温度还在零上五度的时候，接近地面的最低温度已有可能到达零下五度了。
    谈到防霜措施，办法很多（可参考全国科普出版的防霜知识），但在大田里可以普遍使用的，只有以下三种：
    灌水法
    在春季霜冻降临前，在庄稼地上灌水，对于防霜会有极大的好处。因为水好比是一个存付热量的大银行，在空气里热量太多的时候，它可以把外面的热量吸收储蓄下来；而在空气里热量缺少的时候，它又可以毫不费力地付出热量。所以土壤里水分多了，就不会引起靠近地面的空气温度的骤降和猛升；在碰到寒潮侵袭的时候，就可以大大地减轻霜害。如果用井水灌溉，效果更好，因为在初春的时候，井水的温度还比空气的温度高得多。
    用灌水法也可以使空气里的水汽增多，因而提高了空气的湿度，也提高了露点，即提高水汽达到饱和而开始凝结的温度。因为水汽凝结时放出潜热，可以阻止温度继续下降。此外，水汽能吸收地面的热辐射，使地面散热缓慢，因而减轻植物的冻害。
    喷水法
    在霜降临前一、二小时，用喷射药剂的喷雾器盛水，把水喷在作物茎叶上面，使作物茎叶部分恰恰润湿有如轻露的样子；在水还没有变干或结成薄冰层以前，再进行第二次喷射；这样继续到天明日出以后为止，对防霜冻也有很大作用。
    究竟隔多少时间喷射一次呢？这要看情况而定。如果霜冻严重，那末喷射的次数就要多些；霜冻轻微，喷射的次数就可以少些。据估计在一小时内喷射二至四次就可以了。喷射的用水量要比灌溉的用水量少得多，大约一亩田在一个晚上需要的喷水量可以不超过二百斤。
    熏烟法
    熏烟防霜是我国古代的一个老法子，后魏贾思勰著的“齐民要术”一书中就有有关记载。熏烟的时候所产生的烟幕越浓越好，浓厚的烟幕弥漫在接近地面的空气中，可以减低地面热量的向上辐射，使地面的热量不易散失，这样就能保护庄稼，减轻冻害。此外，当烟堆焚烧时也能使接近地面的气层得到一些温暖。在熏烟时，水蒸汽就容易凝结在升起的烟粒上，放出汽化潜热。夜间地面辐射也因上述原因而减弱了，于是地面温度和接近地面空气层中的温度就能略略增高。熏烟应该从地面温度到达冰点以前一、二小时开始，一直保持到太阳升出地平面一、二小时以后，这样可以防止农作物在受到早晨的冷气袭击以后，即经阳光的突然照射，在骤寒暴热下加重冻害。
    但是，熏烟法不如灌水和喷水法好。因为熏烟的效果不很大，只能提高温度一、二度，在气温太低的时候，熏烟就起不了什么作用。其次，熏烟法需占据一定的地面，譬如一亩田地上就需要三至五个烟堆。再次，熏烟动员的人力也太多，不如灌水、喷水省力。而且熏烟的技术不易掌握，烧得太快，变成火堆，不能维持一定的时间，白白耗费燃料。在风力稍大的时候，熏烟也不能发挥作用。所以熏烟法必须谨慎使用，在燃料或人力不充足的地区，或者使用技术没有充分掌握以前，以不轻易使用为宜。
    此外，有些地区有拉霜的办法，用绳子或竹竿等把小麦茎叶上的露水或霜晶拉掉或打掉。这个办法必需绝对禁止。因为拉霜只可以增加冻害，而且小麦经拉打之后，机械的损伤是很严重的。
    为了基本上防治霜冻，可以在春霜经常发生的地区，大致在3月底至4月上旬一段时期，在水源充足的地方，可以不止一次的灌水（在霜冻前一天灌水效果最大），再加上施肥，如果施厩肥，如牛马粪之类，效果更好。因为施用厩肥，不但在轻度霜冻之下可以增强小麦抗冻能力，在严重霜冻之下，可以促进后生分蘖成长，而且厩肥容易醱酵生热，这样也可略略增高地面的温度。
