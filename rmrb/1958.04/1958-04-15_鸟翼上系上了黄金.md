    "When the skin is gone, what can the hair adhere to?" This is the situation of bourgeois intellectuals in China today. "Taking the path of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert" is the only way out for bourgeois intellectuals at present.
    To take this path, it is necessary to reform one's thinking. Some people say: "Being 30% red and 70% expert is enough for me. As long as I don't become a rightist, it's fine." However, "If it doesn't return to Yang, it will return to Mo," and in the end, even the "30% red" cannot be maintained. The result will inevitably be a pragmatist who has lost his way. When a person loses his way, it is like falling into the "Eight Trigrams Formation," where there is more misfortune than good fortune. As the saying goes, "Learning is like rowing upstream; if you don't advance, you retreat." Progress in thought is exactly the same.
    Whether thought reform is good or bad has an objective standard. For bourgeois intellectuals, that is whether they "give their hearts to the Party" and whether they "give their knowledge to the people." Is it a genuine surrender or a fake one? Is it a complete disclosure, or are some skills kept as a last resort?
    The broad masses of working people need knowledge. The working class has deeply realized the meaning of "knowledge is power" in the life-and-death class struggle. Lenin said long ago: "Without knowledge, workers are weak and powerless; with knowledge, they have power!" Recently, the enthusiasm of the peasant masses in Henan for running schools is high. They also say: "Industrialization and agricultural mechanization cannot be realized without culture." This is a concrete manifestation of Lenin's theory.
    Recently, agricultural scientific workers across the country have been going deep into the countryside to help farmers summarize their experiences and spread the seeds of agricultural scientific knowledge. This is a good thing that should be praised. But there are also some bourgeois intellectuals who remain unchanged. For example, there is a professor who, for six years, except for one semester where he supervised the architectural design of fifteen students, has consistently refused to take on teaching work, because he is afraid that "the results of his hard work will be heard by others"! He also refuses to participate in discussion meetings, fearing that "he will involuntarily leak his knowledge when speaking"! Once, when other teachers went to his house, he was not at home. When he found out someone had moved something on his table, he scolded his wife severely afterward for not protecting him well, scolding her for being "not even as good as a watchdog"! This kind of view that treats knowledge as a tool for personal enrichment can be considered despicable to the extreme. Even if he had read ten thousand books, how much would they be worth!
    The world is often like this: the greater the weight of money, the more it brings down people's noble hearts. Didn't the great Indian poet Tagore write such a philosophical poem in "Stray Birds"?
    "If gold is tied to the wings of a bird,
    It will never be able to soar in the sky again."
    This famous saying of Tagore is worth pondering deeply by those bourgeois intellectuals who monopolize knowledge for themselves and do not give it to the people!

    鸟翼上系上了黄金
    王重
    “皮之不存，毛将焉附”这是今天中国资产阶级知识分子的情况。“走工人阶级知识分子又红又专的路”，这是当前资产阶级知识分子的唯一出路。
    要走这条路，就要改造思想，有人说：“我三分红七分专就够了。只要不做右派就行。”但是，“天下不归杨，则归墨”，到头来，“三分红”也就保不住了。结果必然成为迷失方向的实际家。一个人一迷失了方向，就像堕入“八阵图”中一样，凶多吉少。俗语云：“学问如逆水行舟，不进则退”。思想上的进步也完全是这样。
    思想改造得好与坏，有个客观的标准。对资产阶级知识分子来说那就是看他是不是“把心交给党”；是不是“把知识交给人民。”是真交还是假交；是全盘托出，还是留下了看家本领。
    广大劳动人民是需要知识的。工人阶级在你死我活的阶级斗争中深深体会到“知识就是力量”的涵义。列宁早就说过：“没有知识，工人是软弱无力的；有了知识，他们就有力量！”最近河南农民群众兴办学校的热情高，他们也说：“工业化，农业化，离了文化不能化”。这是列宁所说理论的具体化。
    最近，全国各地农业科学工作者都纷纷深入农村，帮助农民总结经验，传播农业科学知识的种子。这是应该赞许的好事。但是也有一些资产阶级知识分子原封不动。例如有一位教授，六年以来除了有一学期指导过十五个学生的建筑设计以外，始终拒绝担任教学工作，原因是怕“自己辛辛苦苦研究得到的成果被人听去了”！他也不肯参加讨论会，恐怕“发言的时候情不自禁地把学问泄漏出去”！有一次别的教师到他家里去，他没有在家，翻动了一下他桌上的东西，他事后竟大骂他的妻子，没有给他保护好，骂她“连看家狗也不如”！这种把知识看成自己发财的工具，也算得卑鄙得到家了。纵使他读破万卷书，又能值几文钱呢！
    世界上往往是这样：金钱的重量越大，它就把人们高尚的心灵也堕下来了。印度大诗人泰戈尔在“飞鸟集”上不是曾经写过这样的哲理诗吗？
    “鸟翼上系上了黄金，
    这鸟便永不能再在天上翱翔了。”
    泰戈尔这句名言是很值得那些把知识垄断为己有，不把它交给人民的资产阶级知识分子深思玩味的！
