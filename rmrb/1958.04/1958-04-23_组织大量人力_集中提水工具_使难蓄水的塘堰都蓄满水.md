　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd. After planting cotton, Xiangyang County in Hubei Province launched another large-scale water storage campaign.

　　Currently, approximately 200,000 male and female commune members across the county are setting up over 7,000 waterwheels along the banks of the county's six major rivers, working day and night to pump river water into newly constructed weirs, ponds, and reservoirs. The banks of the Xiang River, Tang River, Qing River, and other rivers are filled with the sound of waterwheels. Since the full-scale launch of the campaign on the 13th, more than 750 million cubic meters of water have been stored by the 17th, enough for transplanting rice seedlings on 50,000 mu of newly opened paddy fields.

　　Last winter and this spring, Xiangyang County constructed over 8,800 water conservancy projects of various sizes, planning to convert 700,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields this year. Combined with the existing 300,000 mu of paddy fields, the county aims to transplant rice seedlings on 1,000,000 mu this year. However, since the beginning of spring, there have only been three thorough soaking rains in the county, and many newly constructed weirs, ponds, and reservoirs have not been filled. Before the end of March, the county launched a water storage campaign, and it was estimated that the water stored by various methods was enough for transplanting rice seedlings on 510,000 mu of paddy fields, leaving 490,000 mu of newly opened paddy fields short of water for transplanting. Therefore, the Xiangyang County Party Committee put forward the slogan "If there is no water from the sky, we must find water from the ground," and "Work hard for a month to guarantee the transplanting of one million mu," and once again mobilized the masses to launch a water storage campaign.

　　The weirs, ponds, and reservoirs that were easily filled with water were mostly filled before this, and now what remains are more difficult to fill. Therefore, this water storage campaign adopted the method of a large-scale battle, with everyone cooperating and supporting each other, labor being uniformly allocated, and water lifting tools being used collectively. On a battle point, the labor force of several communes and several townships is often concentrated, sectioning the water to the reservoirs or ponds. In the Nizu District, five townships, namely Xinji, Wolong, and Nizu, concentrated more than 2,600 people, 420 waterwheels, and four water pumps, dividing the work into fifteen sections, pumping the Xiang River water over several miles to the highest terrain, Xinji Township. Six agricultural cooperatives in Shiqiao Township dispatched more than 1,100 people and set up more than 150 waterwheels in sections on the Paizi River, filling 28 weirs and ponds in two days. It is expected that the problem of insufficient water for rice transplanting will be resolved by May 7.

### 组织大量人力　集中提水工具  使难蓄水的塘堰都蓄满水

    组织大量人力　集中提水工具
    使难蓄水的塘堰都蓄满水
    新华社武汉22日电　湖北省襄阳县在播种棉花以后，又一次开展一个大规模的蓄水运动。
    现在全县每天有约二十万男女社员，在县内六条主要河道两岸，架起七千多部水车，夜以继日地把河水车到新开的堰、塘和水库里去。襄河、唐河、清河等河沿岸，到处是一片车水声。从13日全面开展运动以来，到17日止，已蓄水七亿五千多万立方公尺，足够五万亩新开水田插秧用。
    襄阳县去冬今春兴修大小水利工程八千八百多处，计划今年改七十万亩旱地为水田，连原有三十万亩水田在内，今年全县要求插秧一百万亩。但入春以来，县境内只下过三次透墒雨，许多新开的堰、塘和水库都未灌满水。3月底以前，全县曾开展蓄水运动，用各种办法所蓄的水，估计够五十一万亩水田插秧用，还有四十九万亩新开水田缺水插秧。因此，中共襄阳县委提出“天上无水地下要”，“苦战一月，保证插秧一百万亩”的口号，再次发动群众开展蓄水运动。
    在这以前蓄满了水的，大都是容易蓄水的堰、塘和水库，现在剩下的都是蓄水比较困难的。因此，这次蓄水运动是采取大会战的办法，大家互相协作，互相支援，劳力统一调配，提水工具集中使用。在一个会战点上往往是集中几个社、几个乡的劳力，分段把水车到水库或塘堰里去。泥咀区的新集、卧龙、泥咀等五个乡集中二千六百多人、四百二十部水车、四台抽水机，分十五段节节地车，把襄河的水翻过几里路车到地势最高的新集乡。石桥乡六个农业社出动一千一百多人，在排子河上分段架上一百五十多部水车，两天便蓄满了二十八口堰塘。预计到5月7日，水稻插秧用水不足的问题就可以解决。
