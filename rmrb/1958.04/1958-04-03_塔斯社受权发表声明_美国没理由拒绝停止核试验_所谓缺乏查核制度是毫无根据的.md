Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 2nd. TASS was authorized on April 1st to issue a statement saying that Soviet leaders expressed regret over the statement issued by the US State Department regarding the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the cessation of testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Soviet Union deeply regrets that the statement by the US State Department, which, according to Washington sources, has been endorsed by President Eisenhower, failed to indicate the willingness of the US government to support the Soviet initiative, to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons itself, and thereby contribute to the great cause of consolidating international peace.

The statement said that the arguments cited in the US State Department's statement are contrived and attempt to cast doubt on the steps taken by the Soviet Union and to slander countries that take the initiative in stopping nuclear tests. Its purpose is obviously nothing more than to justify the US's continued refusal to listen to the demands of the people of all countries and to end nuclear weapons tests.

The US State Department claims that it cannot trust the intentions of the Soviet Union because "there is no verification system for these intentions." But this statement is groundless, because science has proven that any atomic and hydrogen weapon test conducted in any part of the world is easily discovered and confirmed. Furthermore, everyone knows that the Soviet Union not only does not oppose the establishment of necessary international supervision to monitor the fulfillment of the obligation to cease nuclear testing, but also itself proposed the establishment of such a supervisory system after the countries concerned reached an agreement on the cessation of testing. Unfortunately, the US government still does not want to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, nor does it want to establish supervision for the cessation of testing.

The TASS statement said that the Soviet Union warmly supports the resolution of the disarmament issue and believes it is necessary to continue negotiations on this issue. Therefore, the Soviet government has proposed that a summit meeting of the highest-level countries be convened as soon as possible to discuss the disarmament issue and other pressing international issues. The Soviet Union is willing to make every effort to promote the resolution of the disarmament issue. It is willing to continue to make every effort to prevent the catastrophe that humanity might suffer in the event of an atomic war.

### 塔斯社受权发表声明  美国没理由拒绝停止核试验  所谓缺乏查核制度是毫无根据的

    美国没理由拒绝停止核试验
    所谓缺乏查核制度是毫无根据的
    新华社莫斯科2日电　塔斯社1日受权发表声明说，苏联领导人士对于美国国务院就苏联最高苏维埃关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的决议所发表的声明表示遗憾。苏联深感遗憾的是，美国国务院的声明，据华盛顿人士指出，曾经得到艾森豪威尔总统的赞同。特别令人失望的是，这个声明没有表明美国政府愿意支持苏联倡议、自己也停止试验原子武器和氢武器、从而对巩固国际和平的伟大事业作出贡献。
    声明说，美国国务院的声明中所引用的论据是人为杜撰的性质，它企图怀疑苏联所采取的步骤和企图中伤在停止核试验方面表现主动的国家，其目的显然不外乎为美国仍旧拒绝倾听各国人民的要求和拒绝结束核武器试验的态度进行辩解。
    美国国务院声称不能信赖苏联的意图，因为“对这些意图没有任何查核制度”。但是这种说法是没有任何根据的，因为科学已经证实，不论在世界任何部分进行任何原子武器和氢武器试验，都是很容易发现和确定的。此外，大家都知道，苏联不仅不反对建立必要的国际监督来监督履行停止核试验的义务，而且自己也建议在有关国家就停止试验达成协议后建立这种监督制度。不幸的是，美国政府仍然既不想停止试验原子武器和氢武器，也不想对停止试验建立监督。
    塔斯社声明说，苏联热烈赞成解决裁军问题，并认为有必要就这个问题继续举行谈判。因此，苏联政府曾建议，尽速召开最高级国家首脑会议来讨论裁军问题和其他迫切的国际问题。苏联愿意尽一切努力促进裁军问题的解决。它愿意今后仍然尽自己的一切努力来防止一旦爆发原子战争人类可能遭到的灾难。
