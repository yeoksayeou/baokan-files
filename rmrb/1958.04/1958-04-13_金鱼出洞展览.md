    Goldfish Out of Cave Exhibition
    Beihai and Zhongshan Parks have a total of more than four thousand goldfish, including over forty varieties. Among the best are the Purple Cap, Red Tiger Head, and Red Head goldfish that have been raised for twenty years, as well as the new varieties bred in 1957, including the Ink Dragon Well Cap and Red Head Cap goldfish. Now that the weather is warming up, all the goldfish have been brought out of their winter quarters and displayed on fish platforms.
