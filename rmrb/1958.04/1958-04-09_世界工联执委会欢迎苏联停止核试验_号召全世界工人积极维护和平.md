Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 7th. Newspapers here today published the resolutions and documents adopted at the Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which closed in Budapest on the 2nd. In the resolution "On Strengthening the Struggle of the People of All Countries for Peace and the Current Common Tasks of Trade Union Organizations," the Executive Committee expressed its welcome for the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the cessation of nuclear tests.

The resolution believes that if the governments of the United States and Britain also make the same decision, it will be possible to take decisive steps towards completely eliminating the threat of atomic war. Now, there must be no further delay in resolving the issue of stopping the testing of thermonuclear weapons.

The resolution believes that the most important task of trade union organizations in all countries now is to unite the forces of the entire working class at home and abroad in order to fight together with all strata of people who advocate peace, oppose the arms race policy, and strive for disarmament and peaceful coexistence.

The resolution points out that the recent decision of the West German Federal Parliament on equipping the West German army with atomic weapons directly threatens the peace of Europe and the world and exacerbates international tensions. To this end, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions has decided to hold a representative conference of trade unions and working people from European countries in order to unite all forces to oppose the threat of atomic war.

The resolution calls on trade unions in all countries to take concerted action to mobilize the people on a larger scale to strive for the convening of a high-level meeting, the peaceful settlement of disputes, the removal of rocket bases, the cessation of flights by aircraft carrying thermonuclear weapons, the cessation of nuclear tests, the prohibition of the production and use of weapons of mass destruction, to strive for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Europe according to the Rapacki Plan, and to strive for the development of trade and cultural ties between countries.

In its "Letter to the Working People of West Germany," the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the working people of West Germany to take the most resolute measures and actions to strive to make the West German Federal Parliament abolish the decision on equipping the West German army with atomic weapons.

The Executive Committee's "Statement on the Economic and Social Status of the Working People and on the Struggle to Meet the Urgent Demands of the Working People" points out that since the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, the economic and social status of the working people in capitalist countries has further deteriorated. Faced with the total offensive of monopoly capital, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on all trade union organizations to immediately unite their forces and consolidate international solidarity in order to strengthen the united action of all working people, oppose the closure of enterprises and layoffs, strive to increase unemployment benefits and reduce taxes, strive to increase wages and shorten working hours without reducing wages.

In its "May Day Appeal," the Executive Committee calls on workers in all countries to make this year's May Day a great festival of struggle for peace and for meeting their demands, and to unite.

In another appeal, the Executive Committee calls on working people and trade unions around the world to support the decision of the World Peace Council to convene a conference on disarmament and international cooperation in July this year. It also suggests that working people and trade unions in all countries, together with the national peace committees, actively participate in the preparations for this congress and send delegations to attend the congress.

The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions also adopted a resolution on convening the first representative conference of world young workers' trade unions in Prague from July 14th to 20th this year. The resolution believes that convening this representative conference will make young workers around the world more united in the struggle for a better life, to safeguard peace, and for a bright future.

    世界工联执委会欢迎苏联停止核试验
    号召全世界工人积极维护和平
    新华社布达佩斯7日电　此间报纸今天发表了2日在布达佩斯闭幕的世界工会联合会执行委员会会议所通过的决议和各项文件。执委会在“关于加强各国人民争取和平的斗争和工会组织当前的共同任务”的决议中，表示欢迎苏联最高苏维埃关于停止核试验的决议。
    决议认为，如果美国和英国政府也作出同样的决定，那么就将有可能为完全消除原子战争威胁采取决定性的步骤。现在绝不能允许再拖延解决关于停止试验热核武器的问题了。
    决议认为，现在各国工会组织最重要的任务是：团结国内外一切工人阶级的力量以便同各阶层所有拥护和平、反对备战政策、争取裁军与和平共处的人一起，共同奋斗。
    决议指出，西德联邦议院不久前关于用原子武器装备西德军队的决定直接威胁欧洲和全世界的和平，并且加剧了国际紧张局势。为此，世界工联执委会决定举行欧洲国家工会和劳动人民的代表会议，以便团结一切力量来反对原子战争威胁。
    决议号召各国工会一致行动，更大规模地发动人民争取召开高级会议，和平解决争端，撤除火箭基地，使载着热核武器的飞机停止飞行，停止核试验，禁止生产和使用大规模毁灭性武器，争取根据腊帕茨基建议在欧洲建立无原子武器地区，争取发展各国间的贸易和文化联系。
    世界工联执委会在“告西德劳动人民书”中号召西德劳动人民采取最坚决的措施和行动，争取使西德联邦议院废除关于以原子武器装备西德军队的决定。
    执委会“关于劳动人民的经济和社会地位以及为争取满足劳动人民的迫切要求而展开斗争的声明”指出，从第四届世界工会代表大会以来，资本主义国家劳动人民的经济和社会地位更加恶化了。面对着垄断资本的总进攻，世界工联执委会号召一切工会组织立即团结自己的力量并巩固国际团结，以加强全体劳动人民的一致行动，反对关闭企业和解雇，争取提高失业补助费和降低税额，争取提高工资和在不降低工资的情况下缩短工作时间。
    执委会在“五一节号召书”中号召各国工人使今年的“五一”节成为为争取和平、争取满足自己的要求而斗争和团结起来的伟大节日。
    执委会在另一项呼吁书中号召全世界劳动人民和工会支持世界和平理事会关于在今年7月召开裁军和国际合作大会的决定。并且建议各国劳动人民和工会同各国保卫和平委员会一道，积极参加这次代表大会的筹备工作，以及派遣代表团参加这次大会。
    世界工联执委会还通过了关于在今年7月14日到20日在布拉格召开世界青年工人工会第一次代表会议的决议。决议认为，召开这次代表会议会使全世界青年工人在为争取美好的生活、维护和平和光明的未来的斗争中更加团结起来。
