Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In sharp contrast to the capitalist countries shrouded in the shadow of economic crisis, socialist countries are striding forward economically and thriving. A comparison of the national budgets of Vietnam, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary with those of Britain and West Germany this year clearly illustrates this point.

Vietnam's National Revenue Increases This Year
Mainly Used for Economic and Cultural Development

Hanoi (Xinhua) – Le Van Hien, Minister of Finance of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, reported to the National Assembly on the afternoon of the 18th on the draft national budget for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for 1958 and the final national accounts for 1957.

In reporting on the draft national budget for 1958, Le Van Hien pointed out that this year's total domestic financial revenue in Vietnam will increase by 16.7% compared to last year. This year's national expenditures will mainly be used for economic construction and cultural development, with these two items accounting for nearly 60% of the total budget expenditure, a significant increase compared to last year.

He said that with the development of industry and agriculture, the material living standards of the people will improve further this year. Social purchasing power will increase by 5.2% compared to last year, with rural purchasing power increasing by 6.6%.

Le Van Hien said that the principle of "increase production and practice economy, build the country diligently and thriftily" is of particular importance. In the future, a mass movement of "building the country diligently and thriftily" should be vigorously launched, turning "anti-waste, anti-corruption, building the country diligently and thriftily" into the action slogan of all the people in northern Vietnam.

More Investment in Industry in Czechoslovak Budget
Defense Spending Less Than Ten Percent

Prague (Xinhua) – Czechoslovak Finance Minister J. Ďuriš made a report on the 1958 national budget at the National Assembly on the 15th. He said that the draft budget for this year stipulates a total income of 94.725 billion crowns and expenditures of 94.53 billion crowns; income and expenditures increased by 10% compared to last year.

Ďuriš said that in Czechoslovakia's budget, expenditures for industrial development, construction, and transportation, including the funds of the enterprises themselves, total 29.74 billion crowns, with heavy industry taking the lead. This year's expenditures for heavy industry increased by more than 11% compared to last year, with expenditures for electricity and metallurgy increasing by 22%. Funds for the development of agriculture and forestry are almost 10% more than last year. Defense and security expenditures account for 9.4% of the total budget expenditure, and administrative expenses account for 3.6%. Budget allocations for culture, education, health, and other social facilities increased by almost 5% compared to last year.

Hungary's Budget to Have a Surplus
Preparing to Develop Power and Increase Exports

Budapest (Xinhua) – Hungarian Finance Minister Antos announced at the National Assembly on the 17th that the draft Hungarian budget for 1958 stipulates a total income of more than 49.89 billion forints and total expenditures of more than 48.78 billion forints, with a surplus of more than 1.109 billion forints after offsetting income and expenditures. In this year's total budget income, 75% comes from state-owned enterprises (compared to 66% last year); and a little over 4% comes from agricultural production cooperatives. He said that Hungary would use its own strength to achieve a balanced budget this year. Hungary's investment this year will pay special attention to developing power and increasing export-oriented production sectors. This year's industrial production is planned to increase by 7.3%.

British House of Commons Discusses National Budget
Presenting a Pessimistic and Disappointed Scene

London (Xinhua) – In contrast, when the British House of Commons discussed the 1958-1959 fiscal budget on the 15th, it presented a pessimistic, disappointed, and bleak scene. From the budget speech given by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Heathcoat Amory in the House of Commons, it can be seen that the British government still intends to maintain the status quo and "wait and see."

He mentioned some of the difficulties currently facing Britain: the number of unemployed is greater than a year ago; and the growth of foreign trade exports, after a period of relatively stable growth, has recently stopped growing. He believes that this is "an unwelcome result of more difficult conditions in overseas markets due to restricted growth in industrial production in the United States and elsewhere." He estimates that this trend is likely to develop further this year.

Heathcoat Amory also announced some minor tax reforms in his budget speech, due to which the government will reduce tax revenue by 108 million pounds sterling for the entire year. In terms of reducing profits tax and business tax, 39 million pounds sterling is a tax cut for large enterprises.

The "Daily Mirror" commented today: The budget speech does not show at all whether the government believes the greatest danger (to the British economy) is inflation or economic recession.

The "Daily Herald" said: "This is the budget of a government of incompetents and panickers - they are afraid to change the policy of restricting production, which brings unemployment, and they are afraid of being affected by a world economic recession at some point this year."

West Germany's Military Budget Increases Again
Finance Minister Admits Facing Financial Difficulties

Bonn (Xinhua) – West German Finance Minister Etzel presented the draft national budget for 1958-1959, starting from April 1 this year, to the Federal Parliament on the 16th. The draft stipulates a total expenditure of 39.2 billion marks; of which military expenditure accounts for 10.7 billion marks, which is 1.7 billion marks more than last year's military budget.

Etzel admitted that West Germany's fiscal policy will face a new difficult situation starting this year. He said that in the draft budget he proposed, there is still a shortfall of 7 billion marks in the revenue part.

Etzel admitted that the actual military expenditure this year, in addition to the 10.7 billion marks included in the new budget, also includes accumulated funds of approximately 6 billion marks that have been approved by the parliament in previous years but have not been used.

    从两种国家预算看社会制度的优越性
    越捷匈三国经济欣欣向荣
    英国和西德两国政府承认面临财政困难
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：与笼罩在经济危机暗影中的资本主义国家成鲜明对照的是社会主义国家的经济阔步前进，欣欣向荣。对比一下越南、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利三国和英国、西德两国今年的国家预算，就可以清楚地看出这一点。
    越南今年国家收入增加
    主要用于发展经济文化
    越南民主共和国财政部长黎文宪18日下午向国会报告了越南民主共和国1958年国家预算草案和1957年国家决算。
    黎文宪在报告1958年国家预算草案时指出，今年越南国内财政总收入将比去年增加16.7％。今年国家的支出主要将用于经济建设和发展文化，两项将占预算总支出将近60％，比去年大大增加。
    他说，随着工农业的发展，今年人民的物质生活水平将提高一步。社会购买力将比去年提高5.2％，其中农村购买力将提高6.6％。
    黎文宪说，“增产节约、勤俭建国”的方针具有特别重要的意义，今后要大力掀起一个群众性的“勤俭建国”的运动，把“反浪费、反贪污、勤俭建国”变成越南北方全体人民的行动口号。
    捷预算中工业投资增多
    国防费用不到百分之十
    捷克斯洛伐克财政部长尤·杜里什在15日的国民议会上，作了关于1958年的国家预算的报告。他说，今年的预算草案规定总收入为九百四十七亿二千五百万克朗，支出为九百四十五亿三千万克朗；收入和支出比去年增加10％。
    杜里什说，在捷克斯洛伐克的预算中，用于工业发展、建筑和运输方面的支出，包括企业本身的资金在内，共达二百九十七亿四千万克朗，而其中又以重工业占首位。今年用于重工业方面的支出比去年增加了11％以上，其中用在电力和冶金方面的都增加了22％。用于发展农业和林业方面的经费几乎比去年多10％。国防和安全经费占总预算支出的9.4％，行政经费占3.6％。预算中用于文化、教育、卫生和其它社会设施的拨款几乎比去年增加了5％。
    匈牙利的预算将有结余
    准备发展动力增加出口
    匈牙利财政部长安托什17日在国民议会上宣布，1958年的匈牙利预算草案规定总收入为四百九十八亿九千多万福林，总支出为四百八十七亿八千多万福林，收支相抵尚余十一亿零九百多万福林。在今年的预算总收入中，75％来自国营企业（去年占66％）；4％强来自农业生产合作社。他说，匈牙利今年要用自己的力量来达到预算的平衡。匈牙利今年的投资将特别注意用于发展动力和增加出口的生产部门。今年的工业生产规定要增加7.3％。
    英国下院讨论国家预算
    呈现一种悲观失望景象
    与此相反，15日在英国下院讨论1958—1959年度财政预算的时候，呈现出一种悲观、失望、前途暗淡的景象。从英国财政大臣希思寇特—埃默里在下院发表的预算演说中可以看出，英国政府仍然打算保持现状和“等着瞧”。
    他提到了英国目前所面临的一些困难：失业人数比一年以前更多了；对外贸易输出在一个时期的比较稳定的增长以后最近已经停止增长了。他认为，这是“由于美国和其他地方工业生产的增长受到限制使海外市场情况更加困难而造成的不受欢迎的结果。”他估计，这种趋势在今年内很可能进一步发展。
    希思寇特—埃默里在他的预算演说中还宣布了一些次要的税收改革，由于这些改革政府全年将减少一亿零八百万英镑的赋税收入。在减少利得税和开业税方面，有三千九百万英镑是对大企业的减税。
    “每日镜报”今天发表评论说：从预算演说中一点也看不出政府到底认为（对英国经济）最大的危险是通货膨胀还是经济萧条。
    “每日先驱报”说：“这是无能者和惊慌者的政府的预算——他们既怕改变限制生产的政策，而这种政策带来失业，又怕在今年什么时候受到世界经济萧条的影响。”
    西德军费预算又有增加
    财长承认财政面临困难
    西德财政部长埃策尔16日向联邦议院提出了从今年4月1日开始的1958—1959年度国家预算草案。草案规定岁出总额为三百九十二亿马克；其中军费开支占一百零七亿马克，比去年的军费预算多十七亿马克。
    埃策尔承认，西德的财政政策从今年开始将面临新的困难局面。他说，在他提出的预算草案中，岁入部分还有七十亿马克没有着落。
    埃策尔承认，今年的实际军费开支除了新预算中列入的一百零七亿马克外，还有以往几年中已经被议会批准而没有动用的积存款项约六十亿马克。
