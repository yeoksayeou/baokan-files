Xinhua News Agency, Kunming -- Qian Shunqi, a young farmer from Shibi Township, Qilu County, Yunnan Province, has created an advanced experience of simultaneously operating three double-wheeled double-share plows, plowing nine mu of paddy fields and seven mu of dry fields per person per day. His experience has now begun to be promoted throughout Yunnan Province.

Qian Shunqi's main experience in simultaneously operating three double-wheeled double-share plows is: first, training the oxen to be able to pull the plow smoothly along the field ridges without being led by a person, accurately turning along the ridges, until the quality of plowing meets the standards. Then, arrange the three oxen in a straight line, so that the oxen behind follow the oxen in front along the field ridges in sequence. Under normal circumstances, a person only needs to walk along the side. One person managing three oxen and three plows at the same time can plow nine to nine and a half mu of paddy fields or seven to seven and a half mu of dry fields per day, increasing work efficiency by more than one and a half times. The plowed fields neither leave ridges nor are uneven in depth. Currently, four young men and one young woman in this commune have learned this method, and more than half of the seventy-two double-wheeled double-share plowmen in the entire commune can simultaneously operate two plows.

    云南青年农民钱顺起
    一人用三部双铧犁同时耕作
    据新华社昆明讯　云南省杞麓县石壁乡青年钱起顺创造了一人同时掌握三部双轮双铧犁，每天每人犁水田九亩、干田七亩的先进经验。他的经验现在已经开始在云南全省推广。
    钱起顺一人同时掌握三部双轮双铧犁的主要经验是：首先把耕牛训练得能够不用人牵，自己驯顺地沿着埫沟拉犁，准确地沿着埫转弯，直到犁田的质量能够合乎标准为止。然后，再把三条牛排成直线，让后面的牛依序跟着前面的牛沿着埫沟拉犁，在一般情况下，人只要在一旁跟着走就可以了。一人同时管理三条牛三步犁，每天可以犁水田九亩到九亩半，犁干田七亩到七亩半，提高工效一倍半以上。犁过的田既不会留下埂子，深度也均匀。目前，这个社已有四个男青年、一个女青年学会了这种方法，全社的七十二个双轮双铧犁手，半数以上已能同时掌握两部犁。
