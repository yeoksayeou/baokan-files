    Tianjin Medical Equipment Factory Should be Responsible for Product Quality
    Last year, our team bought a Model 5606 electric blueprint machine manufactured by the Tianjin Medical Equipment Factory, worth more than 3,000 yuan. This expensive blueprint machine has never successfully produced a single blueprint. We have repeatedly experimented many times according to the instructions, but we could not produce a satisfactory drawing. Therefore, this expensive electric blueprint machine has been left untouched in an empty room.
    During the "Double-Anti" movement, our team contacted the Tianjin Medical Equipment Factory more than once, requesting the factory to help repair the blueprint machine. However, until now, the factory has not given a definite reply, only writing an irresponsible reply letter. We believe that the Tianjin Medical Equipment Factory should be responsible for product quality and should not adopt delaying tactics.

### 天津医疗器械厂应该对产品质量负责

    天津医疗器械厂应该对产品质量负责
    我队去年买来了一部天津医疗器械厂制造的价值三千多元的5606型电动晒图机。这部贵重的晒图机器没有一次顺利地晒出一张蓝图来。我们曾经根据说明书反复地进行过多次试验，都不能晒出一张使人满意的图纸。因此，这部价值昂贵的电动晒图机，一直放在空屋子里没人动。
    在“双反”运动中，我队不止一次的和天津医疗器械厂联系，请求这个厂协助修理这台晒图机。然而到现在这个厂也没有作出肯定答复，只写了一封不负责任的复信。我们认为天津医疗器械厂对产品质量应该负责任，不应该采取推拖的办法。　皖东南地质队　张曦
