    YongSheng Fountain Pen Should Improve Quality
    On January 25th of this year, I bought a folding YongSheng brand fountain pen at the Guiyang City Cultural Goods Company store. The style is beautiful. But before I had used it for two months, the middle section of the pen barrel cracked. I suggest that the YongSheng Fountain Pen Factory should immediately find ways to improve product quality.

    永生金笔应改进质量
    今年1月25日，我在贵阳市文化用品公司门市部买了一支折叠式的永生牌金笔，式样美观。但是还没有用两个月，笔杆的中节就裂口了。我建议永生金笔厂应立即设法改进产品质量。
