Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th - The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 4th, rejecting the request of Paul Willens, the lawyer for John W. Powell, former editor of the China Weekly Review in Shanghai, for the U.S. government to conclude a judicial assistance agreement with China.

The State Department's statement said that for the U.S. government to negotiate or conclude an agreement of the kind requested by Willens "would violate established U.S. policy."

Willens came to China in January this year to collect evidence to defend Powell. Powell incurred the wrath of the U.S. government for reporting on American bacteriological warfare in Korea during his time as editor of the China Weekly Review. After returning to the United States, he was charged with "sedition" by the U.S. government.

During his time in China, Willens met with dozens of people from all walks of life. They unanimously pointed out to Willens that Powell's reports in the China Weekly Review about American aggression against China and Korea, as well as American crimes of bacteriological warfare, were completely true and reliable. They said that if a judicial assistance agreement were concluded between China and the United States, they would be willing to testify for Powell and provide ample evidence. Willens left China at the end of February and returned home.

    美国国务院竟拒绝威林要求
    不肯同我国缔结司法协助协议
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院4日发表声明，拒绝了前上海密勒氏评论报主笔鲍惠尔的律师威林要美国政府同中国缔结司法协助协议的要求。
    国务院的声明说，对美国政府来说，同中国谈判或者缔结威林所要求的那种协议，“将违反美国的既定政策”。
    威林今年1月曾经来中国搜集替鲍惠尔进行辩护的证据。鲍惠尔因为在主办前密勒氏评论报期间，报道了美国在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行而引起美国政府的怀恨，在回国后被美国政府控以“煽动叛乱”罪。
    威林在中国期间会见了数十名中国各界人士。他们一致向威林指出，鲍惠尔在密勒氏评论报所报道的关于美国侵略中国和朝鲜以及美国进行细菌战等罪行，完全是真实可靠的。他们表示，假如中美两国间缔结了司法协助的协议，他们愿意为鲍惠尔作证，并且提供充分证据。威林是在2月底离开中国回国的。
