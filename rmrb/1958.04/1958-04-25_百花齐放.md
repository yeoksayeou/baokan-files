    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
  23　The flat stems of the Epiphyllum oxypetalum are like arrows, and the red flowers blooming on them resemble water lilies. People say: We are more vibrant than the night-blooming cereus, not like it, blooming for only a moment. This is too much praise, and it is very dangerous for us, as we may become complacent and fall behind without end. The night-blooming cereus has a much more generous demeanor; as long as the flower is beautiful, what does the length of its bloom matter?
  24　Night-blooming cereus, yes, our flowering time is indeed too short. We only know tonight, not tomorrow. People have to sacrifice sleep to see us, leading to the idiom "a flash in the pan." Quick but not plentiful, good but not lasting, are major flaws; yet people favor us, treating flaws as perfection. If there is no way to change this inherent nature, we cannot help but feel ashamed when we are so valued.
  25　Cephalocereus senilis: We are inappropriately called swan eggs, but in reality, we look like a large fluffy pincushion. We also bloom, at the top of the fluff, with small silver-white trumpets of twenty-six petals. Like the night-blooming cereus, our flowering time is also short, but we prefer the morning, not the evening. We are diametrically opposed to sluggishness and inertia, and we muster our vigor to herald the sun's triumph.
  26　Calceolaria: Calceolaria is like a flower peddler traveling between urban and rural areas, bringing the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program to the countryside. Originally, it was planned to be fully realized within ten years, but who knew it could be completed in less than seven years. Now, a great need is brought from the countryside: the hope to gradually push the technological revolution to a climax, to achieve agricultural electrification, mechanization, and fertilizer chemicalization as quickly as possible, running faster and faster.
  27　Rapeseed Flowers: We turn the earth into a sea of gold, thanks to spring, and even more so to the vast number of farmers. The working people are the true masters of the universe; for them, we are willing to be ground to powder. We do not covet the vases of the elegant; village girls wearing us in their hair rival Yingying. Billions of seeds are pressed into golden oil, and the oilseed cake is then ground into fertilizer for the fields. (Attached image)

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
  23　令箭荷花一片片叶茎是一支支令箭，箭上开出些红花活像睡莲。人们说：我们比昙花还要鲜艳，并不像昙花那样只开一瞬间。太夸奖了，这对我们是很危险，会因为自满，落后到没有边缘。昙花的风度比我们大方得多，只要花好，何在乎花时的长短？
  24　昙花是的，我们的花时实在是太短，我们只知有今宵，不知有明天。要牺牲睡眠才能和我们见面，落得形成一个成语“昙花一现”。快而不多，好而不省，是大缺点；人们偏爱，却把缺点当成美满。如果没有办法把这生性改变，受着人们重视不免感觉羞惭。
  25　天鹅蛋我们不适当地被呼为天鹅蛋，其实倒像一个插针的大绒团。我们也开花，开在绒团的顶端，银白色的小唢呐有二十六瓣。我们同昙花一样花时也很短，但我们喜欢清早，不喜欢晚间。我们和暮气惰气是势不两立，我们鼓足朝气吹奏太阳凯旋。
  26　蒲包花蒲包花是往来城乡间的花蒲包，带下乡去的是农业纲要四十条；原打算在十年内能够完全实现，谁知道不要七年就可以完成了。现在从乡间带来了一个大需要：希望把技术革命逐步推到高潮，农业电气化、机械化、肥料化学化，尽可能快马加鞭，跑得愈快愈好。
  27　菜子花我们把大地化成了一片黄金，多谢春天，更要多谢广大农民。劳动人民是真正的宇宙真宰，为了他们，我们甘愿粉骨碎身。我们不稀罕雅人们的花瓶，乡村姑娘戴在头上赛莺莺。亿万颗种子榨成金色的油，油枯还要辗成为肥田的粉。（附图片）
