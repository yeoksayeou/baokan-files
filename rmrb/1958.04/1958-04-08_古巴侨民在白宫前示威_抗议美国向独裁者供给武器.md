    Cuban Expatriates Demonstrate in Front of White House
    Protesting U.S. Supply of Arms to Dictator
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 7th — Approximately one hundred Cuban expatriates held a demonstration on the 6th in front of the White House, the U.S. President's residence in Washington, protesting the U.S. supplying arms to Cuban dictator Batista to suppress the insurgent people. The demonstration lasted for more than an hour. (See picture below)
    Prior to this, U.S. Democratic Party black Congressman Powell gave a speech in New York on the 5th, exposing that the U.S. military mission in Cuba is directly commanding the Cuban dictatorial government's army in its operations against the Cuban insurgent forces. Powell also accused the U.S. of supplying weapons to Dominican dictator Trujillo, who then transferred these weapons to Batista to attack the Cuban insurgent forces. Powell demanded that the U.S. government immediately withdraw its military mission from Cuba.

    古巴侨民在白宫前示威
    抗议美国向独裁者供给武器
    据新华社7日讯　华盛顿消息：大约一百名古巴侨民6日在华盛顿白宫美国总统府门前举行示威，抗议美国把武器供给古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔去镇压起义人民。示威持续了一个多钟点。（见下图）
    在这以前，美国民主党黑人众议员鲍威尔5日在纽约发表谈话，揭露美国驻古巴军事代表团正在直接指挥古巴独裁政府的军队对古巴起义部队作战。鲍威尔同时指责美国把武器供应给多米尼加独裁者特鲁希略，而接着又由特鲁希略把这些武器转运给巴蒂斯塔来进攻古巴起义部队。鲍威尔要求美国政府立即从古巴撤回军事代表团。
