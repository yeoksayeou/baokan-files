Using Coal as Raw Material and Fertilizer as the Center
    Huainan Marches Towards a Chemical Industrial Base
    (Our newspaper, Hefei, 15th dispatch) Anhui Province has decided to build a chemical industrial base in Huainan City during the Second Five-Year Plan, using coal as raw material and fertilizer as the center. A large-scale chemical fertilizer plant with an annual output of 420,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, a coking plant with an annual output of 1.2 million tons, and large-scale chemical plants that fully utilize coal by-products to produce synthetic gasoline, synthetic alcohol, and synthetic fibers will be built here. The original plan to build a fertilizer plant with an annual output of 210,000 tons of ammonium sulfate in Huainan City is required to be completed a year ahead of schedule, in 1960, as the first phase of the ammonium sulfate fertilizer plant. Construction of this plant will begin on June 1.
    Huainan City has many favorable conditions for building a chemical industrial base. It has the Huainan Coal Mine, one of the five major coal mines in the country, which can provide abundant raw materials for the chemical industrial base; the Huainan Power Plant can fully supply electricity; and the Huai River has good water supply conditions. The other raw material for fertilizer, pyrite, is abundant in Xiangshan, Tongguanshan, Fanchang and other places, and railway transportation is also very convenient.

    煤炭为原料　化肥为中心
    淮南向化工基地前进
    本报合肥15日电　安徽省决定在第二个五年计划期间，在淮南市建设一个以煤炭为原料，以化肥为中心的化学工业基地。这里要建设年产四十二万吨硫酸铵的大型化学肥料厂，年产一百二十万吨的炼焦厂，以及充分利用煤的副产品建设合成汽油、合成酒精、合成纤维等大型化工厂。原计划在淮南市兴建的年产二十一万吨硫酸铵的化肥厂，要求提前一年，于1960年全部建成，作为硫酸铵化肥厂的第一期工程。这个厂将于6月1日动工兴建。
    淮南市具有建设化学工业基地的许多优越条件。这里有全国五大煤矿之一的淮南煤矿，可为化学工业基地提供丰富的原料；淮南电厂可以充分供应电力；淮河有良好的供水条件。化肥的另一种原料硫铁矿在向山、铜官山、繁昌等地贮量丰富，铁路运输也很方便。
