    Shortcomings of the Film "Love Story"
   Chun Cheng

    "Love Story" depicts the love stories of several shop assistants. The film satirizes young people with bourgeois views on love that are obsessed with status and money. This is a comedy, and some parts go too far, and some jokes are rather vulgar. The ideological and artistic shortcomings are prominent, but it still has some educational significance. It praises commercial workers who are enthusiastic about serving customers, and also criticizes shop assistants who are not dedicated to their work and lack a correct understanding of their work. The audience just needs to view those shortcomings with a critical eye.

    A young man and woman who work actively in commercial positions are the positive characters in the film, giving the audience a good impression. They are simple and sincere, and their attitude towards love is generally correct. In particular, the young man is portrayed somewhat better.

    Of course, due to the inappropriate pursuit of amusement, some things that are not completely consistent with the characters' personalities have also been added to the image of the positive characters, making them seem not real enough, and therefore not successful enough. They appear as critics of the bourgeois thinking of the other young couple. However, when they finally advise the criticized couple to "restore their feelings," the attitude they show is not really principled. It is just an attitude of compromise, thinking that "the rice is already cooked," so just make do. If what they criticize is "don't break up rashly," then what they advocate is nothing more than "you can get together rashly." While they deny some "conditions," such as "status" and "money," they do not express what the correct attitude towards love should be. What they mean by "true love" is really questionable.

    This is how they are on the issue of love, but what about other aspects of life? The advanced young man at work can be said to only indulge his bad friend in the same room. He lends money, lends clothes, covers shifts, but completely ignores his friend's thoughts and behavior, without criticizing him. Our ideal characters are by no means good-for-nothings, and by no means people who watch their friends do bad things without criticizing them. It is said that some shop assistant viewers, after watching this film, believe that the positive character is a good example to learn from. What he says is basically correct, but it must be noted that this character also has shortcomings and is not entirely worthy of learning from. Writers can of course portray positive characters with shortcomings. In real life, positive characters may also have shortcomings, but in artistic works, the author's clear praise and criticism of the characters' thoughts and behaviors must be displayed.

    What about the portrayal of the people being criticized? The film's criticism of their attitude towards work and their almost hooliganistic behavior is very insufficient. This is a serious shortcoming. When the author is describing those bad ideas and bad styles, he lacks a solemn attitude, and seems to only want to achieve cheap comedic effects. The young man's consistent lying and deception, serious shortcomings at work, and hooliganistic means of treating women have not been seriously criticized. Of course, it seems that the author did not want to portray them as incorrigible bad people, but there is no transformation, and some mistakes are principled. Our so-called serious criticism does not mean that we require a stiff lecture to be inserted into the film. The problem lies in the artistic image, which should make the audience feel clear love and hate, but now it is far from enough. A light tone drowns out the seriousness of the problem.

    The film's sloppy ending makes this shortcoming even more prominent.

    In addition, there are too many scenes reflecting eating, drinking, and having fun. Depicting our youth's life as being all about eating, drinking, and having fun, and desperately wanting to get married, and finding objects by any means, is distant from real life.

    电影“寻爱记”的缺点
   春城
    “寻爱记”所描写的是几位售货员的恋爱故事，影片对那种满脑子是地位、金钱的资产阶级恋爱观念的青年，进行了讽刺。这是喜剧形式的片子，有的地方过火，有的笑料比较庸俗，思想上艺术上的缺点是突出的，但多少还有一些教育意义。它表扬了热心为顾客服务的商业工作者，也对那种不安心工作、对自己的工作缺乏正确认识的售货员，作了一些批评。只要观众对那些缺点用批判的眼光去看就行了。
    一对在商业岗位上积极工作的男女青年，是影片中的正面人物，给观众以相当的好感，朴质真诚，对待恋爱的态度大体上也还正确。特别是那位男青年，比较起来，刻划得更好一些。
    当然，由于不适当地追求趣味，也把一些与人物性格不完全统一的东西加到了正面人物形象上去，使人觉得不够真实，因此也就不够成功。他们两人是作为另一对青年的资产阶级思想的批评者的身份出现的。可是他们最后劝告那对被批评的青年“恢复感情”时，所表现出来的态度，也不是真正有什么原则性，而不过是和事老的态度，所谓“生米已成熟饭”，将就一下算了。如果说他们所批评的是“不要轻率破裂”，那么他们所主张的也无非是“可以轻率结合”罢了。他们固然否定了一些“条件”，比如“地位”“金钱”等等，却也并没有表示应该怎样才是正确的恋爱态度。他们所说的“真的爱”究竟是什么内容，实在也成问题。
    在恋爱问题上是这样，在生活的其他方面呢？那位工作先进的男青年对待他的同房间的坏朋友，可以说只是一味迁就。借给钱，借给衣服，代值班，而对朋友的思想行为完全不闻不问，不加批评。我们的理想人物决不是滥好人，决不是眼看朋友作坏事而不加批评的人。据说有的售货员观众看了这部片子以后认为其中的正面人物是学习的好榜样。他的话基本上是对的，但是必须注意到这个人物身上也还有缺点，不完全是可以学的。作家当然可以描写有缺点的正面人物，在现实生活中，正面人物也可能有缺点，但是在艺术作品中，必须显示出作者对人物的思想、行为的鲜明的褒贬。
    对于被批评的人物的描写又是怎样呢？对于他们的对待工作的态度和那种近乎阿飞的行为，影片的批评是非常不够的。这是一个严重的缺点。作者在对那些坏思想坏作风进行描写的时候，缺乏严正的态度，而似乎只是想取得廉价的逗笑的效果。那个男青年的一贯的说谎欺骗，工作上的严重缺点，对待女性的流氓手段，没有受到严肃的批判。当然，看来作者并不是想把他们写成是不可救药的坏人，可是也没有什么转变，而有的错误是有原则性的。我们所谓严肃的批判，决不是说要求在影片中生硬地插进一段训话。问题在于艺术形象，应该使观众产生分明的爱憎之感，而现在则是很不够。一种轻松的情调淹没了问题的严重性。
    影片的草率的结尾使这一缺点更加突出。
    另外，反映吃喝玩乐的场面也过多了。把我们青年的生活描写成尽是吃喝玩乐，只是拼命想结婚，不择手段地找对象，是与现实生活有距离的。
