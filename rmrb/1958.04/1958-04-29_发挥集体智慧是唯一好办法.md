Collective Wisdom is the Only Good Way

Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

I have been back in China for almost two and a half years. In these two and a half years, I have had many incorrect views about doing scientific research in China.

When I first returned to China, based solely on my past experience in the United States, I felt that I had previously engaged in some pioneering work such as the development of liquid rockets, supersonic aircraft, and high-speed combustion stability. At the time, these were unsolved problems, with no teachers to consult. I had to摸 (mō - feel/grope) my way through, from not understanding to understanding, from having no theory to摸 (mō - feel/grope) and creating theory. After returning to the motherland, based on some previous experience abroad, I was very optimistic: I thought that as long as I had the support of the Party and the government, doing some scientific research and solving some engineering and technical problems would be no problem at all. When the Party called for catching up with the world's advanced levels in twelve years, I thought at the time, why so slow, why does it take twelve years! Obviously, that was my period of ignorance, not knowing the immensity of the universe. Later, after the research plan was set, and I really started to do research, I gradually felt that there were many difficulties. There were no research tools, and no research equipment. At the same time, I thought that since there was the support of the leadership, then let us start doing it ourselves, designing and creating research equipment. But even that couldn't be done. Why? Because there was no research team, and no metal workshop. At this time, my thinking turned 180 degrees, from optimism to pessimism. I really felt that it was impossible to move an inch in scientific research, which was really maddening. In fact, this was precisely my learning period. It can be said that I understood a little more than at the very beginning, and I knew some practical things, but I didn't know enough. I didn't know how to struggle in difficult circumstances and find a way out, how to start from scratch.

Now, thinking back, the way out was clearly laid out there. The only good way to do everything, including scientific research, is to mobilize everyone and rely on everyone. From the scope of a research institute, the so-called everyone means all the personnel in the institute, all the research and administrative staff. If we can work together with everyone, then there will be achievements every day. Things we can't do can also be learned, because we can learn from mistakes. What we don't know today, we will know tomorrow. This matter of mobilizing everyone seems simple, but for individualists, that is, for people like me who have bourgeois ideas, it is not easy to do. Because with personal plans, wanting to compete with others, one will use one's energy in the wrong place, not on solving research problems, but on planning personal plans all day long. This, of course, cannot achieve true unity, and there will be rifts between people. When we consider problems, our thoughts will not be in the same place, and there will be no way to bring out collective wisdom. This problem is manifested in many places, for example: young researchers are afraid of older researchers; but the young people don't know that the older ones are also afraid of the young ones, and it's best not to look for them. The same is true among senior researchers. When discussing issues, they first make a defense in their minds, fearing that they will miss something, reveal a flaw, and let another comrade see it and lose face, and perhaps not be able to maintain their prestige in the future. There are really many ideological concerns. We often see some researchers in the institute looking sad, feeling a lot of pressure. At this time, our Party put forward the call for rectification. After the rectification movement started, there was the anti-Rightist struggle, the sending of cadres to lower levels, and then the checking of the five airs, anti-waste, and anti-conservatism. In this way, we intellectuals all realized the location of our bourgeois erroneous thoughts, and we also saw how hateful the yesterday's self was, and that we must painfully change today. This means that everyone's ideological awareness has been greatly improved, and everyone's vision and goals have been turned to the cause of the 600 million people! Therefore, I believe that after this rectification movement, everyone will show a new spirit, and the previous difficulties will certainly be swept away. As long as we can put on the skin of the working class, we can be with the 600 million people, our power is truly endless, and there will absolutely be no difficulties that cannot be overcome. So now I have regained the high degree of optimism I had more than two years ago. I feel that the scientific leap forward must ride the waves, which is entirely possible.

Now, when talking about scientific planning, we should look further ahead

Since this is the case, we should look further ahead and see what problems we have in a relatively long period. For example, we should note that since the National Agricultural Development Program 40 Articles were put forward, the production enthusiasm of the members of agricultural cooperatives across the country has been high. Especially since last winter, under the leadership of the Party, it has been truly overwhelming. It is estimated that these 40 articles may be realized in seven years or even a shorter time. In scientific research, seven years is not too long a time. We should now think about what to do next after all the content of the National Agricultural Development Program 40 Articles has been realized? We should prepare for the things to be done in scientific research so that we can keep up when the time comes. On this point, I am an amateur. As a person engaged in mechanics, I cannot help but always consider it from the energy aspect. Recently, I have calculated such a rough account, that is, how much energy the sun receives on a unit area on the earth. Assuming that sunlight shines on the ground for only eight hours a day, 365 days a year, and if we only calculate 1% of the energy used to convert into plant-effective energy, this energy can convert water and carbon dioxide into starch, then it can produce about 8,000 jin of starch per mu per year. Of course, there are many problems in this, it is not that simple. But we can consider it in this direction. There are still many problems in agricultural production, such as the control of artificial weather. When water conservancy has achieved the targets set by the Agricultural Development Program, it can basically eliminate less serious natural disasters. But can relatively large natural disasters, such as typhoons, not be controlled? This is also a problem worth studying. Furthermore, there is the issue of our agricultural power. In this regard, it seems that an important solution is the so-called utilization of bio-energy, that is, fermenting manure and weeds to produce biogas. This process is basically the decomposition of carbohydrates, and the products produced after decomposition are almost half biogas and half carbon dioxide. It is certainly not good to burn with this mixed gas. Although biogas is a very good fuel, carbon dioxide is not a very good power fuel. It only reduces the burning speed when it is mixed in. Therefore, we must find a way to separate biogas and carbon dioxide, and use pure biogas as the power of internal combustion engines. This can solve our difficulty of lacking oil resources. At the same time, carbon dioxide is also useful. Carbon dioxide is a fertilizer for plants. Can we consider filling the air in greenhouses with carbon dioxide so that plants can grow better? At the same time, carbon dioxide can be used to cultivate chlorella, and chlorella contains a considerable amount of protein, at least it is a very good feed, which can be used to feed pigs.

Like this series of problems, it is not only a matter of agricultural mechanization, electrification, and chemization, but how to apply engineering technology and natural science knowledge to agriculture, so that agricultural production also becomes like a factory, producing under controlled conditions. This can also be called the industrialization of agriculture. This problem will take a considerable amount of time to solve, it is highly comprehensive, there are problems in various aspects, and almost every research department is related to it.

Perhaps some comrades will think like this: Is it too far to talk about these new technologies today? Today, in the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, our thinking can easily fall behind reality. Things in our country always move very quickly, and scientific research should not be the tail of production, but should be ahead of production. Therefore, when discussing scientific planning, we should plan for the long term.

Various sciences should support and permeate each other, so that science can develop comprehensively

The Chinese Academy of Sciences is most suitable for developing new sciences between disciplines. For example, physics should permeate various departments. The biophysics now proposed is a very important science. At the same time, we should also consider how to make natural science and technology science permeate the social science departments. For example, can modern mathematical methods and computing technology serve engineering economics and industrial economics? Problems that were not done before because there were too many calculations and analysis was difficult can be done with new methods. Naturally, mathematics is only a tool. Using it is not to change social science but to help the development of social science.

Leaping Forward in the High Tide

Under the leadership of our Party, after the rectification movement, a high tide of the Great Leap Forward has been set off across the country. In this high tide, everyone has been greatly encouraged. Things that seemed impossible to do before can now be done. Our scientific workers not only have the support of the 600 million people in our country, but we also have the support of the 200 million people in the Soviet Union. Moreover, through the cooperation of science and technology between China and the Soviet Union, we also have the help of experienced Soviet scientists who are advanced in the world. As long as we take out our hearts and hand them over to the Party and the people, the Great Leap Forward of our scientific undertaking is certain.

    发挥集体智慧是唯一好办法
    中国科学院力学研究所所长　钱学森
    我回到祖国已经差不多有两年半了。在这两年半中间，我对于在中国作科学研究工作是有着不少错误的看法的。
    发挥集体智慧，排除个人主义，没有克服不了的困难
    在我刚回到中国来的时候，单凭过去在美国的经验，觉得自己以前也搞过一些像发展液体火箭、超声速飞行器、高速燃烧稳定等开创先例的工作。在当时，这些问题是没有解决的问题，没有老师可以请教，要自己去摸，从不懂摸到懂，从没有理论去摸索、去创造理论。回到祖国，根据从前在国外的一些经验，我十分乐观：心想只要有党和政府的支持，作点科学研究，解决一些工程技术问题，是毫无问题的事。党号召十二年赶上世界先进水平，我当时心里想，怎么这么慢，那会要十二年！很显然，那是我无知的时期，不知天高地厚。后来研究计划定下来了，真要动手作研究了，这才逐渐感到困难重重，既没有研究工具，也没有研究设备。同时我也想，既然有领导的支持，那么就让我们来动手作吧，来设计、创造研究设备吧。可是连这也干不了，为什么呢？因为没有研究队伍，金工厂也没有。这时候，我的思想转了一百八十度，从乐观一变而为悲观，真是觉得作科学研究寸步难移，简直急死人。其实这正是我的学习时期，可以说比刚一开始懂得了一点，知道了一些实际东西，可是知道得还不多。我不知道在艰苦的环境中奋斗、找出路，怎样白手起家。
    现在想起来，出路明明白白地摆在那儿，办一切事业的唯一好办法，包括科学研究在内，就是发动大家、依靠大家。从一个研究所的范围来讲，所谓大家，就是全所的人员，全所的研究和行政事务人员。我们能和大家一起动手，那么做一天就会有一天的成绩，不会做的事也可以学，因为作错了也可以学乖，今天不会的，明天就会了。发动大家这件事看来简单，但对个人主义者来说，也就是对我这样具有资产阶级思想的人来说，却是不容易做到的。因为有了个人打算，要和人比高低，就会把劲头用错地方，不用在解决研究问题上去，而是用在一天到晚筹划个人计划。这样当然达不到真正的团结，人与人之间有了隔阂。当我们考虑问题的时候思想上就走不到一处，就没有法子发挥集体的智慧。这个问题表现在很多的地方，例如：年青的研究人员怕年长的研究人员；而年青的却不知道，年长的也怕年青的，最好不找他们。高级研究人员之间也是这样，讨论问题时，心里先就作一个防备，生怕自己漏了，漏出毛病来，让另外一位同志看见了丢脸，将来也许不能保持自己的威信。真是思想上顾虑重重。所内常常看到一些研究人员愁眉苦脸，觉得压力很大。正在这个时候，我们的党提出了整风的号召，整风运动开始后，跟着就是反右派，搞干部下放，然后是查五气、反浪费、反保守，这么一来，我们这些知识分子都认识了自己资产阶级错误思想之所在，也看清了昨日之我如何可恨，今天非痛改不可。这就是说每一个人的思想觉悟都大大地提高了，大家的眼光、目标都转到六亿人民的事业上去了！所以，我相信在这次整风运动以后，每一个人都会表现出一番新的气概，从前的那些困难也一定会一扫而空。只要我们能够附上工人阶级的皮，我们就可以跟六亿人民在一道，我们的力量真是无穷无尽，绝对不会有什么克服不了的困难。所以我现在又恢复了两年多以前的高度乐观。我觉得科学的跃进要乘风破浪，这是完全可能的。
    现在谈科学规划，应该把眼光放远
    既如此，我们就应该把眼光放远些，看看在比较长的时期内，我们有些什么问题。举个例来说，我们应该注意到，从农业发展纲要四十条提出来以后，全国农业合作社的社员们生产情绪高涨。尤其在去冬以来，在党的领导下，真是排山倒海。估计这四十条可能在七年或者更短一些时间就可以实现。在科学研究上，七年的时间不是一个太长的时间。我们现在应该想想，农业发展纲要四十条的内容统统实现以后，下一步又要干什么？要干的事，在科学研究方面应作好准备，到时候我们就能跟得上去。在这一点上，我是外行。作为一个搞力学的人来说，不免总是从能量方面来考虑。最近我算过这么一个粗浅的账，就是地球上一个单位面积上，受太阳的能有多少。假设我们说一天太阳光照在地面上，只照八小时，一年三百六十五天，八小时太阳光照上去，如果我们只计算1％的能用来转变为植物有效利用的能，这个能把水和二氧化碳转变为淀粉，那么就可以在一亩面积上年产约八千市斤的淀粉。当然这里面有许多问题，不是那么简单。但我们可以向这个方向去考虑。关于农业生产方面还有许多问题，如人工气象的控制等。当水利方面已经实现农业发展纲要规定的指标的时候，就可以基本上免除不太大的自然灾害。但比较大的自然灾害，如台风，是不是就不能控制呢？这也是一个值得研究的问题。再说我们的农业动力问题，在这方面看来一个重要的解决途径是所谓生物能的利用，也就是使粪便和杂草醱酵产生沼气。这个过程基本上是炭水化合物的分解，分解后产生的东西差不多一半是沼气，一半是二氧化碳。如用这种混合气体当然不太好烧，沼气虽然是很好的燃料，而二氧化碳不是很好的动力燃料，它夹杂在里面只会减低燃烧速度。因此，就要想出办法把沼气和二氧化碳分离，用纯沼气作为内燃机的动力，这就可以解决我们缺乏石油资源的困难。同时，二氧化碳也有用处。二氧化碳对植物来说是一种肥料，是不是能考虑在暖房里把空气中充上二氧化碳，使植物的生长可以更好一些。同时二氧化碳可以用来培养小球藻，而小球藻又含有相当多的蛋白质，至少是很好的饲料，可以喂猪。
    像这一系列的问题，就不仅是农业机械化、电气化、化学化的问题，而是把工程技术、自然科学知识怎样应用到农业上去，使农业生产也成为一个工厂似的，在控制的条件上来生产。这也可叫作农业的工业化。这个问题需要相当长的时间才能解决，是高度综合性的，其中有各方面的问题，差不多各个研究部门都同它有关。
    也许有的同志会这么想：这些新技术，今天我们来谈是不是太远一点？今天在全国大跃进的形势下，我们的思想很容易落在现实的后面。我们国家里的事情总是走得很快，而科学研究不应该是生产的尾巴，应该走在生产的前面。所以讨论科学规划的时候，应当从长计较。
    各门科学要互相支援、互相渗透，使科学能全面发展
    中国科学院最宜于发展学科之间的新科学，譬如说物理就应该渗透到各个部门中去。现在提出的生物物理，就是一门很重要的科学。同时我们也应该考虑怎样使自然科学、技术科学渗透到社会科学部门。例如：能不能让近代数学的方法和计算技术为工程经济和工业经济服务？在以前因为计算太多，分析有困难而不去做的问题，有了新方法就能做了。自然，数学只是一个工具，用了它不是去改变社会科学而是去帮助社会科学的发展。
            在高潮中跃进
    在我们党的领导下，经过整风以后，全国掀起了一个大跃进的高潮。在这个高潮中，我们每个人也受到了很大的鼓舞。从前看起来不能做到的事，现在也能做到了。我们科学工作者不仅有我国六亿人民的支持，我们还有苏联两亿人民的支持，而且通过中苏两国科学技术的合作，我们还有世界上先进的有经验的苏联科学家的帮助，只要我们把我们的心掏出来，把心交给党，交给人民，我们科学事业的大跃进是一定的。
