The Varieties of Sunflower

The sunflower is also known as sunflower seed, "turning-to-the-sun lotus," and "gazing-at-the-sun lotus." It is said that this crop originated in Mexico, America. Peru even uses the sunflower as its national flower to symbolize brightness. As early as 1510, the sunflower was introduced to Europe. It is not clear when it was introduced to China.

The sunflower is an annual herbaceous plant of the Compositae family, with a very tall stem and many oval-shaped large leaves. The top of the stem has many small flowers clustered together to form a large flower head. There are two different kinds of small flowers in the flower head. The surrounding flowers are golden yellow, and the petals look like tongues. The seeds of the sunflower are black, dark purple, white, and some have black stripes or gray stripes.

Sunflowers are divided into three types: edible, oil-producing, and edible-oil dual-purpose. The edible type has a thick and strong stem, up to eight or nine feet tall, with large leaves and large flower heads. The seeds are large and long, with a thick shell and a low oil content of only about 30%. The oil-producing type is five or six feet tall, and the stem has branches. The flower head is smaller than the edible type, and the seeds are also shorter, but the oil content is higher, about 40%-55%. The oil content of the edible-oil dual-purpose type is between the edible type and the oil-producing type. A good sunflower can produce about 2,000 seeds in its flower head, weighing four to six taels.

Edible and intermediate sunflower varieties are mostly selected and bred by Chinese farmers. Oil-producing varieties were introduced from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and Hungary after liberation. These oil-producing varieties generally perform well in Northeast China and some areas along the Bohai Sea coast.

The Economic Value of Sunflowers

Sunflower seed oil is a highly nutritious edible oil. It has great uses in industry and can be used to make paints and soaps. It can also be used in leather making to make the leather strong, soft, and shiny. The black sunflower seed shells can be used as dye. The oil cake left after pressing the oil is a good feed for livestock. Fresh stalks and leaves are also good green feed. The fiber in the stems can be used to make textiles and paper. The stems, flower heads, and seed shells can also be used as fuel. The ash after burning is a good fertilizer with a high potassium content.

The sunflower is a relatively high-yielding oil crop. Generally, the yield per mu is about 100 to 120 jin, and the high yield is 300 jin. On saline-alkali land where other crops do not yield well, planting sunflowers can yield 100 to 200 jin per mu.

How to Grow Sunflowers

Sunflowers are highly adaptable and can grow well in soils with a salt content of 0.3%-0.4%.

Sunflowers are very resistant to cold. Their seeds can germinate at five or six degrees Celsius, so early-maturing sunflowers can also be planted in high-altitude cold mountainous areas with a short frost-free period.

When using vacant land to plant sunflowers, the land should also be cultivated. Before sowing, dig planting holes or trenches seven or eight inches deep. At the same time, apply fertilizer. It is best to apply the base fertilizer in the trenches or holes.

When sowing, choose plump and large seeds. Soak the selected seeds in cold water for half a day before sowing to promote faster germination.

The planting density should be determined according to the variety and soil fertility. For large-scale cultivation, the distance between rows should be two chi, and the distance between plants should be one and a half chi. For sporadic cultivation, the density should be determined according to the terrain, but should generally not be lower than the above standards.

Because sunflower seeds are resistant to low temperatures, they can be sown early. In northern provinces, sowing can be done between Qingming and Guyu (around April), and southern provinces can appropriately advance the sowing time. Timely sowing is an important key to increasing production. Northern provinces have a relatively short growing season, so they should sow early and in a timely manner.

Sporadic cultivation often uses hole sowing, with four or five seeds sown in each hole. Seedlings can emerge about ten days after sowing. At this time, attention should be paid to thinning seedlings as soon as possible. After the seedlings emerge, the first thinning should be carried out immediately, leaving two plants per hole; when there are three or four leaves, set the seedlings, leaving one plant per hole.

Sunflowers have a very high survival rate when transplanted, and early transplanting has no impact on yield, so seedlings can be transplanted to fill gaps when there are missing seedlings.

During the entire growth period of sunflowers, cultivate the soil three to four times in combination with weeding. If irrigation and application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are carried out after flowering, the effect of increasing production will be better.

Leaves are the factory for sunflowers to manufacture nutrients. If the leaves are removed, the sunflower will be malnourished, the flower head will not grow large, and the seeds will not be full.

When sunflowers are in full bloom, relying solely on insect pollination is not enough. It is best to assist pollination two or three times. The time for assisted pollination should be on sunny mornings.

    向日葵的种类
    向日葵又叫葵花子、转日莲、望日莲。据说这种作物原产美洲墨西哥。秘鲁还把向日葵花当作国花，以象征光明。远在1510年的时候，向日葵传到了欧洲。什么时候传到中国，还没有弄清楚。
    向日葵属菊科一年生草本植物，茎秆很高，有很多卵形的大叶子。茎头有许多小花聚在一起，凑成一个大花盘。花盘里有两种不同的小花。周围的花颜色金黄，花瓣好像舌头一样。向日葵的种子有黑色的、深紫色的、白色的和有黑色条纹的或灰色条纹的几种。
    向日葵有食用、油用和食油两用三种。食用种茎秆粗壮，高达八九尺，叶大花盘大，种子又大又长，皮壳厚，种仁含油分低，只有30％左右。油用种高度五、六尺，茎秆有分杈，花盘比食用种小，种子也比较短小，但含油多，约有40％—55％。食油两用的含油量在食用种和油用种之间。一棵好的向日葵，花盘里能结子二千粒左右，有四两到六两重。
    食用种和中间种向日葵多是我国农民选育出来的，油用种是解放后由苏联、匈牙利等兄弟国家引进来的。这些油用种在我国东北地区和渤海沿岸一些地区表现一般良好。
  向日葵的经济价值
    葵花子油是一种养分很高的食用油。它在工业上的用途很大，可以制造油漆和肥皂，用来制革能使皮革坚固、柔软和光亮。黑色葵花子的外壳，可以做染料。榨了油剩下的油饼是家畜的好饲料。新鲜的秆叶也是很好的青饲料。茎秆中的纤维可以制纺织品，也能用来造纸。茎秆、花盘和籽壳还可以当柴烧。烧出来的灰，又是一种含钾很多的好肥料。
    向日葵是一项比较高产的油料作物。一般亩产一百到一百二十斤左右，高产的有三百斤。在种植别的作物收成不好的盐碱地上，种向日葵每亩就能收到一、二百斤。
    怎样种向日葵
    向日葵的适应性较强，在含盐0.3％—0.4％的土壤里可以长得很好。
    向日葵的抗寒力很强，它的种子在摄氏五、六度就可以发芽，因而在无霜期较短的高寒山区也同样可以栽种早熟种向日葵。
    利用隙地种向日葵同样应该进行整地，播种前点种穴或沟可刨七、八寸深。同时结合施肥，基肥最好施在沟内或穴内。
    在播种的时候，可选饱满大粒的种子，播种前把选好的种子用冷水泡半天，以促使种子更快的发芽。
    种植的密度要根据品种和土壤肥力来决定，大面积栽培时每行距离二尺，每株相距一尺半；零星栽培看地形决定，一般不应低于上述标准。
    由于向日葵的种子能抗低温，所以可以早播，北方各省在清明到谷雨间就能播种，南方各省还可以适当的提早。适时播种是增产的重要关键。北方各省生育期比较短，更应适时早播。
    零星栽培多用穴播，每穴播种子四、五粒，播种后十天左右幼苗就可以出土。这时应注意及早间苗。幼苗出土后应即进行第一次间苗，每穴留二株；在有三、四片叶子的时候定苗，每穴留一株。
    向日葵移栽成活率很高，早移对于产量也没有什么影响，所以缺苗时可以移苗补栽。
    在向日葵整个生育期里应中耕三到四次并结合除草，如果现花后能灌水并增施磷、钾肥料，增产效果更好。
    叶子是向日葵制造养料的工厂，打掉了叶子向日葵就要营养不良，花盘就长不大，结的种子不能饱满。
    向日葵盛花的时候，单单依靠昆虫传粉是不够的，最好由人来辅助授粉两三次。辅助授粉的时间要在晴天的早晨。
