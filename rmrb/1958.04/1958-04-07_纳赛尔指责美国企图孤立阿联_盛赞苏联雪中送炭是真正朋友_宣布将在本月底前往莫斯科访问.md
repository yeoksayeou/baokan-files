Xinhua News Agency, April 6th: According to a broadcast by the American Columbia Broadcasting System, Arab United Republic President Nasser, in an interview with a reporter from the broadcasting company, accused the United States of attempting to isolate the newly formed Arab United Republic.

Nasser pointed out that after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, the United States froze Egypt's foreign exchange assets and refused to supply Egypt with the wheat and medicines it needed. He said, "It seems very obvious to us that the policy of the United States is to isolate Egypt and constantly put pressure on us. Since then, pressure has also been applied to Syria."

Nasser said that during this period, the Soviet Union proved itself to be a true friend, providing assistance when Western countries froze Egyptian assets and Egypt was in danger of starvation. He pointed out that Egypt accepted Soviet aid as an act of self-defense against (Western) economic pressure and to prevent starvation.

He said, "We have reached an agreement with the Soviets for a loan of 700 million rubles. Both sides agreed that they will submit this loan according to our requirements—submit equipment or factories. A delegation was sent to Moscow in February. They agreed to submit equipment for twenty-five factories to Egypt. Moreover, they agreed to negotiate the submission of equipment for another forty new factories. ...But I think it will take some time to submit this equipment." He said that we will get complete factory equipment such as machine tool factories and textile factories.

Nasser announced that he will visit Moscow at the end of this month.

    纳赛尔指责美国企图孤立阿联
    盛赞苏联雪中送炭是真正朋友
    宣布将在本月底前往莫斯科访问
    据新华社6日讯　据美国哥伦比亚广播公司广播，阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔在接见这家广播公司记者时发表谈话，指责美国企图孤立新成立的阿拉伯联合共和国。
    纳赛尔指出，在埃及把苏伊士运河收归国有以后美国冻结了埃及的外汇资产，并且拒绝供应埃及所需的小麦和医药品，这是敌意行动。他说，“在我们看来十分明显，美国的政策是要孤立埃及，对我们不断施加压力。在那以后又对叙利亚施加压力。”
    纳赛尔说，在这期间，苏联证明自己是一个真正的朋友，在西方国家冻结埃及资产而埃及有挨饿危险的时候送来了援助。他指出，埃及接受苏联援助是为了抵抗（西方的）经济压力、防止饥饿而进行的自卫行动。
    他说，“我们已经同苏联人达成贷款七亿卢布的协议。双方协议，他们将按照我们的要求提交这项贷款——提交设备或工厂。2月间派了一个代表团到莫斯科去。他们同意提交埃及二十五个工厂设备。而且他们同意，还要谈判提交另外四十个新工厂设备的问题。……但是我想，提交这些设备需要一些时间。”他说，我们将得到像工作母机工厂、纺织工厂等全套的工厂设备。
    纳赛尔宣布，他将在本月底前往莫斯科访问。
