Build Hydraulic Factories and Hydroelectric Stations According to Local Conditions:
Shaanxi Province Fully Utilizes Water Power

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 2nd) Shaanxi Province recently proposed to fully utilize water power as an important measure to ensure the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.

Shaanxi Province has very rich water resources. There are more than 500 rivers in the province, as well as thousands of canals built by farmers themselves. Farmers in Shaanxi have a long history and rich experience in using water resources. In southern Shaanxi and the Guanzhong area, the masses have a tradition of using water power to grind flour, press oil, gin cotton, and fluff cotton. Zhouzhi County currently has 230 water-powered cotton gins, 230 water mills, 27 oil presses, and 45 cotton fluffing machines. This power, which does not consume any feed, can replace more than 1,800 strong livestock. In the wave of the Great Leap Forward, cadres and the masses in various places actively tried to improve tools and expand the use of water resources. For example, Li Jinshao, deputy political commissar of the Lueyang County Military Service Bureau, designed water-powered single-pipe waterwheels and water-powered double-pipe waterwheels based on the principle of water mill rotation. The water-lifting function of the water-powered single-pipe waterwheel is 2.7 times higher than that of an animal-powered waterwheel. Many agricultural cooperatives in southern Shaanxi have built their own canals, carrying out irrigation on the one hand, and using water power to transport fertilizer and firewood and other items on the other, which also saves a lot of labor.

In order to mobilize the masses to make fuller use of water power to replace human and animal power, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a symposium of some county party secretaries. At the symposium, everyone unanimously agreed that although Shaanxi Province had a tradition of using water power in the past, the water power that has been utilized is still very small, and the potential is great. Therefore, when formulating plans, all localities should include the use of water resources. The way to use water power is, first of all, to promote and encourage agricultural cooperatives to build a large number of small hydropower stations, using wooden wheels or iron water wheels to directly drive flour milling, cotton ginning, and other equipment; after accumulating a certain amount, then further develop power stations. Small-scale hydropower stations are also mainly run by agricultural cooperatives, with the state providing necessary assistance or support. Larger hydropower stations are run by the state. The meeting also requested the water conservancy, industrial, commercial, and planning departments to assist agricultural cooperatives in solving design, equipment, and technical problems in the utilization of water power. Now, many counties have decided to build small hydropower factories and hydropower stations.

### 因地制宜建水力工厂、水电站  陕西省充分利用水力

    因地制宜建水力工厂、水电站
    陕西省充分利用水力
    本报西安2日电　陕西省最近提出要充分利用水力，把它作为保证工农业大跃进的重要措施之一。
    陕西省水力资源非常丰富。全省共有五百多条河流，还有农民自己兴修的上千条渠道。陕西农民利用水力资源已经有悠久的历史和丰富的经验。在陕南和关中地区，群众都有用水力磨面、榨油、轧花、弹花的传统。盩厔县目前就有利用水力带动的轧花车二百三十架、水磨二百三十台、榨油锅二十七口、弹花机四十五台。这些不吃任何饲料的动力，可以代替一千八百多个壮牲畜。在大跃进的浪潮中，各地干部、群众积极想办法改进工具，扩大对水力资源的利用面。例如，略阳县兵役局副政委李金绍根据水磨转动的原理，设计成功了用水力带动的水力单管水车和水力双管水车。水力单管水车的汲水功能，就比畜力水车提高了二点七倍。陕南地区不少农业社自己兴修水渠，一面进行灌溉，一面利用水力运送肥料和柴草等物品，也节省了很多劳动力。
    中共陕西省委为了发动群众更充分地利用水力代替人力畜力，不久以前召集了部分县委书记进行了座谈。座谈会上，大家一致认为，陕西省过去虽然有利用水力的传统，但是已经利用的水力还很少，潜力很大。因此，各地在制定规划时，应把利用水力资源包括在内。利用水力的方式，首先是提倡和鼓励农业社大量兴办小型水力站，用木轮或铁制水轮直接带动磨面、轧花等设备；等到有一定积累以后，再进一步搞发电站。小型水利发电站也以农业社自办为主，国家给以必要的协助或支援，较大型的水力发电站由国家举办。会议还要求水利、工业、商业和计划部门，协助农业社解决利用水力的设计、设备和技术问题。现在，许多县已经决定要建设小型水力工厂、水力发电站。
