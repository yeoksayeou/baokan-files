To the esteemed Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao:

We, the comrades attending the National Youth Workers' Representative Conference, with great excitement, on behalf of the ten million young workers across the country, extend our most lofty respect to our esteemed Party Central Committee and our great leader and teacher.

The Party leads the people of our country in victoriously carrying out one revolution after another. Each revolutionary struggle has deeply educated us and increased our courage and confidence in moving forward. Now the Party is leading the people of the whole country in a Great Leap Forward posture to build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. This is the best time in our country's history. We young workers have never been as energetic and motivated as we are today. We must, under the wise leadership of the Party, enable our country to quickly get rid of its economic and cultural backwardness and become a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

We deeply know that to shoulder this great and arduous historical task is by no means easy. We young workers have little experience and lack training, and are easily influenced by non-proletarian ideas. However, we have grown up under the education of the esteemed Party and Chairman Mao, and our hearts are closely linked with the Party and socialism. We must study politics diligently, transform our thinking, learn technology, and improve our skills, and train ourselves to become strong class fighters, and never allow our thinking to lag behind the great era.

We guarantee to the Party: We must work diligently and listen to the Party's call at any time. Wherever the Party wants us to go, we will go there without haggling. Whatever the Party wants us to do, we will do it without picking and choosing. Wherever there are difficulties, we will go there without avoiding danger. We young workers must, as the Party teaches, always be enthusiastic and energetic, and become a heroic shock force in building the motherland.

We guarantee to the Party: We must be determined to study hard and diligently, and tenaciously advance towards culture, technology, and science. Although we have little knowledge and low skills, the Party's education has given us high aspirations and great courage. Technology is learned through hard work, and knowledge is gained through study, just as one of our representatives said, "The size of the factory doesn't matter, the age of the machines doesn't matter, the amount of capital doesn't matter, only people are treasures." As long as we young people can, as the Party often teaches, honestly and persistently learn from veteran workers, learn from technicians, and learn from all capable people, and accept, apply, and develop all their useful knowledge and experience, we will certainly be able to make ourselves people who are proficient in professional technology and become socialist builders who are conscious and capable as soon as possible.

Esteemed Chairman Mao, we must firmly remember your teachings: "Modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind." Although the comrades who attended this conference have made some achievements in their work, they have only done what we should have done. The achievements we have made cannot be separated from the leadership of the Party, the education of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, the guidance of veteran workers, and the support and help of the collective. The socialist cause is developing rapidly and constantly putting forward new and higher demands on us. We must not be arrogant or complacent, but continue to work hard, strengthen our training, and achieve both redness and expertise, thorough redness and deep expertise.

Esteemed Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we are about to leave Shanghai and return to our posts. Before the end of the conference, we adopted a letter of proposal to young workers across the country. We believe that all young workers will use their practical actions to, together with workers across the country, with an overwhelming spirit, implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and make greater achievements in the great cause of building socialism.

    全国青年工人代表会议
    向中共中央和毛主席的保证书敬爱的党中央和毛主席：
    我们出席全国青年工人代表会议的全体同志，怀着激动的心情，代表全国一千万青年职工，向我们敬爱的党中央和我们伟大的领袖和导师致以最崇高的敬意。
    党领导着我国人民，胜利地进行着一个革命又一个革命。每一次革命斗争，都使我们受到深刻教育，增加了我们前进的勇气和信心。现在党又领导着全国人民以大跃进的姿态，多快好省地建设社会主义。这是我国有史以来的最好时光。我们青年工人从来没有像今天这样精神焕发、干劲十足。我们一定要在党的英明领导下，使我们的国家迅速地摆脱经济上和文化上的落后状态，成为一个拥有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义的强国。
    我们深深知道，要担负起这个伟大艰巨的历史任务，决不是轻而易举的事。我们青年工人经历少，锻炼差，容易受到非无产阶级思想的影响。但是，我们是在敬爱的党和毛主席的教养下成长起来的，我们的心跟党和社会主义紧紧地联结在一起。我们一定努力学习政治，改造思想；学习技术，提高本领，把自己锻炼成为坚强的阶级战士，决不使自己的思想落后于伟大的时代。
    我们向党保证：我们一定要勤勤恳恳的劳动，随时听从党的召唤。党要我们到那里，我们就到那里，不讲价钱。党要我们干什么，我们就干什么，不挑不拣。那里有困难，我们就到那里去，不避艰险。我们青年工人一定要像党所教导的那样，永远热情积极，朝气蓬勃，成为建设祖国的一支英勇的突击队。
    我们向党保证：我们一定下决心勤学苦钻，顽强地向文化进军，向技术进军，向科学进军。尽管我们的知识少，技术低，但党的教育使我们志气高，勇气大。技术是钻研出来的，知识是学习得来的，正像我们的一位代表所说的“厂子不在大小，机器不在新老，资金不在多少，唯有人是宝”。只要我们青年人能够像党经常教导的那样，老老实实地，坚持不懈地向老工人学习，向技术人员学习，向一切有本领的人学习，把他们一切有益的知识和经验都接受过来，加以运用和发展，我们就一定可以尽早使自己成为精通业务技术的人，成为有觉悟有本领的社会主义建设者。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们一定牢牢记住您的教诲：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。我们参加这次会议的同志，虽然在工作上做出了一点成绩，也只不过做了我们应该做的事情。这些成绩的取得，是同党的领导，工会和共青团的教育，老工人的指点，以及集体对我们的支持和帮助分不开的。社会主义事业飞跃地向前发展，不断地向我们提出了新的更高的要求。我们一定不骄傲，不自满，继续努力，加强锻炼，做到又红又专，红透专深。
    敬爱的党中央和毛主席，我们就要离开上海，回到自己的岗位上去。在会议结束以前，我们通过了向全国青年工人的倡议书。我们相信，所有的青年职工都将用自己的实际行动，同全国职工一起，以排山倒海的气概，贯彻又多又快又好又省的方针，在建设社会主义的伟大事业中作出更大的成绩。
        全国青年工人代表会议
                1958年4月12日
