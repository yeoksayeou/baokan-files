    Mobilize the Masses, With the Force of a Bamboo Splitting!
    Zhu Que
    Starting yesterday, Beijing launched a large-scale war to encircle and annihilate sparrows. The entire city, men and women, old and young, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, were mobilized, unified in action, and launched a major offensive against sparrows. People made vows: within three days, adopt a comprehensive tactic of blasting, poisoning, beating, and raiding nests to basically eliminate sparrows. Streets and alleys, inside and outside courtyards, rooftops, trees..., everywhere troops were deployed, gongs and drums sounded together, bamboo poles and colorful flags waved in unison, a chorus of "strike" resounded. The frightened sparrows fled in all directions, without a moment to breathe, without a place to perch, truly at the end of their ropes, with wings unable to escape. Exhausted, they had to fold their wings and be captured, or starve to death from exhaustion. In addition, there were attacks from firearms and slingshots, poisoned bait was laid, and nests were raided and blocked at night. Finally, the "permanent thief's" "household registration" was written off with a single stroke.
    Standing in the ranks of the war to encircle and annihilate sparrows, one cannot help but feel the power of the masses. Not long ago, didn't some people say, "Sparrows fly high, how can they be eliminated," and "Why make a fuss about eliminating sparrows, making such a big deal out of it?" These people just wanted to show that sparrows did not need to be eliminated or could not be eliminated. However, Beijing has eliminated more than 1.7 million sparrows in the past four months (yesterday's results are not included), and 17 counties in the Wenjiang Special District of Sichuan fought hard for three days, eliminating more than 1 million sparrows. These figures are the answer. I don't want to say much about this. It is this issue of "making a big deal out of it" that makes me think about our spirit and working methods.
    "Making a big deal out of it," that's right. The Communist Party has always emphasized the mass line, mobilizing and relying on the masses. Many things are not done well, and the root cause is often that we did not think of "making a big deal out of it" and did not fully utilize the power of the masses. Once we break through the framework of conservative thinking, boldly and freely mobilize the masses, we will advance with the force of a bamboo splitting, and miracles will continue to appear. Take sparrow hunting for example. Although there were no fixed methods before, it was nothing more than decentralized combat using methods such as capturing and beating, individual attacks. This method can also be effective, but it always misses many. The method of "blasting" has also been used, but it can only drive the sparrows away, but it cannot "kill" the sparrows. Now everyone is acting, and groups are blasting them, sparrows cannot but cast themselves into the net. This is where the power of the masses lies. If you don't believe it, try blasting those sparrows flying all over the sky with one person or a few people! Even if you had wings, I am afraid it would be difficult to blast them down from the sky.
    "Making a big deal out of it" to catch sparrows is not just about believing in the soaring enthusiasm and revolutionary spirit of the masses. It also demonstrates the original spirit of being good at adopting mass working methods. Seriously "making a big deal out of it" also means not being blindly reckless. The method of mobilizing the whole people to encircle and annihilate sparrows is good because it has fully studied the enemy's situation and grasped the weaknesses of the sparrows; it is good because it adopts various methods suitable for different groups of people, fully utilizes the power of the masses, and eliminates the enemy in one fell swoop. In the battle to encircle and annihilate sparrows, men and women, old and young, all went into battle together, without a single idle person, and everyone was able to show their abilities and devote themselves to the struggle. Knowing yourself and knowing your enemy like this, how can you not be victorious in every battle!
    Basically eliminating sparrows within three days is an unprecedented feat in history. After a hard battle, what we have gained is not only the elimination of a pest, but also the learning of an experience. That is, in our work, as long as we rely on the masses and use bold and innovative methods to twist the enthusiasm of the broad masses into a single rope, any difficulty will have to bow to this force. Some people sighed in front of small sparrows, thinking that they could not be eliminated, that was just comparing sparrows with personal power. What skills do sparrows have? It is nothing more than having a pair of wings, and what about the power of the masses? It has more than thousands of wings growing!
    Mobilizing the masses to eliminate sparrows is just the beginning of our conquering nature. We must mobilize more masses and always maintain the momentum of splitting bamboo!

    发动群众，势如破竹！
    朱确
    昨天起，北京市展开了一场围剿麻雀的大战。全市男女老少，工农兵学商，一齐动员，统一行动，向麻雀大举进攻。人们立下誓言：要在三天之内，采取轰、毒、打、掏的综合战术，把麻雀基本上消灭干净。大街小巷、院里院外、楼顶、树上……，到处陈兵布阵，金鼓齐鸣，竹竿、彩旗一齐挥动，一片喊“打”之声。那受惊的麻雀，四处逃窜，无一时喘息机会，无一处栖身之地，真是走投无路，有翅难逃。筋疲力竭之后，不得不敛翅就擒或者饿死累死。再加上火枪、弹弓袭击，施放毒饵，夜间掏堵，最后，这“老家贼”的“户口”就一笔勾销了。
    置身在围剿麻雀的战斗行列中，使人不能不有感于这群众力量的强大。前不久，不是还有人在说“麻雀飞的高，怎能消灭掉”、“除麻雀，何必小题大作，兴师动众”的吗？这些人无非是想说明麻雀是不必消灭或者不能消灭的。可是，北京市四个月来消灭麻雀一百七十多万只（昨天的战绩还未计在内），四川温江专区十七个县苦战三天，消灭麻雀一百多万只，这数字就是回答。对此，我不想多说。倒是这“兴师动众”的问题，使我想到了我们的气魄和工作方法。
    “兴师动众”，这真说对了。共产党从来讲究的，就是走群众路线，发动群众、依靠群众。许多事情办不好，归根结柢，常常是因为没有想到“兴师动众”，没有充分发挥群众的力量。一旦冲破了保守思想的框框，大刀阔斧、放手发动群众，就会势如破竹，奇迹也跟着不断出现。就拿打麻雀来说，以前虽没有什么一定的作法，但不外是用捕、打等办法分散作战，个别袭击。这作法也能收效，可总还是捕一漏万。“轰”的办法也有采用的，那只能把麻雀轰跑，却不能把麻雀轰“死”。现在人人动手，群起而轰之，麻雀不能不自投罗网。这就是群众威力的所在。不信，对那漫天乱飞的麻雀，一个人或少数人去轰吧！就是你插上翅膀，恐怕也难以把它轰下天空来。
    “兴师动众”捕麻雀，岂止是相信群众的冲天干劲和革命气魄而已。还表现了善于采取群众性工作方法的独创精神。认真地“兴师动众”，也就不会盲目蛮干。这全民动员围剿麻雀的办法，好就好在对敌情作了充分的研究，抓住了麻雀的弱点；好就好在采取各种各样适合不同群众的方法，充分利用群众力量，对敌人一举而歼之。围剿麻雀的战斗中，男男女女、老老少少一齐上阵，没有一个闲人，每个人都能够各显其能投身到斗争中去。如此知己知彼，哪能不百战百胜！
    三天之内基本上消灭麻雀，这是有史以来不曾听闻过的举壮。一番苦战下来，我们得到的收获，不仅是除了一害，而且也学到一条经验。那就是：在工作中只要依靠群众，用大胆革新的办法把广大群众的劲头拧成一股绳，任何困难都要向这力量低头。有些人在小小的麻雀面前唉声叹气，认为灭它不了，那只是把麻雀和个人的力量作了比较。麻雀有何本领？它无非是生了一双翅膀，而这群众力量，何止生长着成千上万的翅膀！
    发动群众，消灭麻雀，这只是我们征服大自然的开始。我们还要发动更多的群众，永远保持着破竹之势！
