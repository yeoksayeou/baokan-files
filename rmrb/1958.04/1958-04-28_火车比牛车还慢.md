    The Train is Slower Than an Ox Cart
    On April 10th, we consigned a batch of drilling tools from Zhangdian Station to Tai'an. The two places are only 181 kilometers apart. Although the distance is not far, the tools had not arrived after ten days. Because we urgently needed to use these tools, we went to Tai'an Station every day to inquire, but the comrades in the freight office always said that they had not arrived and told me to come back and see tomorrow. If we had used an ox cart to transport this batch of tools, even at the slowest rate of 18 kilometers per day, it would have arrived in Tai'an in ten days. Is it possible that the train is slower than an ox cart?

    火车比牛车还慢
    4月10日，我们从张店车站托运一批钻探工具到泰安。两地相距只有一百八十一公里，虽然路程不远，可是过了十天还没见工具运来。因为我们急待使用这批工具，就天天到泰安车站去询问，可是货运室的同志每次都说还没到，叫我明天再来看看。假如我们把这批工具用牛车来拉，每天最慢走十八公里，那末十天也能运到泰安了。难道火车比牛车还慢吗？
