	Commercial Personnel Embark on Industrial and Agricultural Fronts
	Shuangshui District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xinhui Builds Pig Farm, Tianjin Sends Two Thousand People to Factories

	(Our newspaper's Guangzhou dispatch on the 13th) Reporter Yang Weiqun reports: The Shuangshui District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, is leading small merchants to establish a 10,000-pig farm on barren hills. This is beneficial for the further transformation of small merchants and provides experience for solving the problem of insufficient turnover and bloated staff and surplus funds in cooperative stores and joint state-private stores that are common in various market towns.
	The Shuangshui District 10,000-pig farm began to be established in mid-January this year. Now, vigorous efforts are continuing to carry out the basic construction of the pig farm. It is planned that by the end of the year, nearly 300 surplus small merchants in the district will be transferred to the pig farm to raise 10,000 pigs.
	The Shuangshui District originally had 679 small merchants with nearly 150,000 yuan in capital. Due to the large number of people, the average business volume per employee was only 270 yuan per month last year. Some small merchants engaged in speculation and profiteering in the market, causing trouble. Last August, after a great airing of views, a great debate, the ideological awareness of small merchants was somewhat improved, but the problem of the outlet for labor and capital remained unresolved. Until the end of last year, the local Party committee decided to mobilize small merchants to directly participate in agricultural and sideline production. Therefore, a great debate on how small merchants should support the great leap forward in agricultural production was launched among all small merchants in the district, and the idea of establishing a 10,000-pig farm was proposed for everyone to discuss. As a result, all small merchants (including individual operators) voluntarily signed up to work on the pig farm. Then, after democratic appraisal and leadership approval, the first batch of small merchants was organized to go up the mountain.
	This 10,000-pig farm was established according to the "five selfs" principle (self-raising funds, self-building dormitories, self-building pig houses, self-planting feed, self-breeding piglets), requiring to achieve building the farm with salary in one year, self-sufficiency in production in two years, great development in three years, and a net income of 2 million yuan in five years.

	(Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 13th) The first batch of more than 2,300 commercial personnel in Tianjin has embarked on the industrial front to support the great leap forward in industrial production.
	After the great leap forward in industrial production in Tianjin, production targets have increased greatly, some by one to several times. Many factories, while tapping production potential and improving labor productivity, still need to appropriately expand and add equipment and increase a small number of personnel. Taking the Tianjin Machinery and Electrical Industry Bureau as an example, the production target of this bureau this year has increased by 103% compared with the actual total output value of last year. At present, the factories under its jurisdiction have adopted a series of measures to increase production, and the average labor productivity of workers has increased by 65.8% compared with last year. However, to complete this year's production leap forward plan, it is still necessary to increase manpower equivalent to 18% of the existing total number of workers.
	On the other hand, after the start of the great leap forward in commercial work, the employees of the commercial system are full of energy, boldly innovating their work, changing labor organization, strengthening collaboration, or implementing a shift system that goes to the end, improving the nature of service, and the number of personnel can also be greatly reduced. According to the preliminary plans of various commercial units, about 40,000 commercial personnel can be reduced in the city.
	Based on this new imbalance between industry and commerce, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to transfer employees from the commercial sector to support industrial production. After this decision was conveyed to the employees of the commercial sector, the employees enthusiastically supported it and rushed to sign up, requesting to go to the industrial production front. The workers in the factories also warmly welcomed this new force, and many veteran workers expressed that they would teach their skills to them without reservation, so that they could quickly master production technology.

### 商业人员走上工农业战线  新会双水区供销社建养猪场，天津两千人进工厂

    商业人员走上工农业战线
    新会双水区供销社建养猪场，天津两千人进工厂
    本报广州13日电　记者杨伟群报道：广东省新会县双水区供销合作社领导小商贩在荒山上创办万头猪场，有利于小商贩的进一步改造，为解决各地墟镇普遍存在的合作商店和公私合营商店营业额不足，而人员臃肿、资金过剩的问题，提供了经验。
    双水区万头猪场是在今年1月中旬开始创办的。现在正继续大力进行猪场的各项基本建设，计划在年底以前，全区过剩的近三百个小商贩都转业到猪场，养猪一万头。
    双水区原有小商贩六百七十九人，资金近十五万元。由于人数过多，去年平均每个从业人员每月只做二百七十元的生意。部分小商贩在市场上投机倒把，兴风作浪。去年8月间，经过大鸣大放大辩论，小商贩的思想觉悟有所提高，但是劳动力和资金的出路问题仍旧没有解决。直到去年年底，当地党委决定发动小商贩直接参加农副业生产，于是在全区小商贩中展开小商贩如何支援农业生产大跃进的大辩论，并提出创办一个万头猪场让大家讨论。结果，全部小商贩（包括个体经营的）都自愿报名去猪场生产，然后经过民主评议、领导批准，组织了第一批小商贩上山。
    这个万头猪场，是采取“五自”（自集资金、自建宿舍、自筑猪舍、自种饲料、自育猪苗）的方针创办的，要求做到一年带薪建场，二年生产自给，三年大发展，五年纯收入二百万元。
    据新华社天津13日电　天津市第一批共两千三百多名商业人员走上工业战线，支援工业生产大跃进。
    天津市工业生产大跃进以后，生产指标增长很大，有的增长一倍到几倍。不少工厂在发挥生产潜力，提高劳动生产率的情况下，还需要适当扩建和增添设备，增加少数人员。以天津机电工业局为例，这个局今年的生产指标比去年实际生产总值增加103％，目前所属各厂采取了一系列增产措施，工人劳动生产率平均比去年提高了65.8％，但要完成今年的生产跃进计划，还需要增加相当于现有工人总数18％的人力。
    另一方面，在商业工作大跃进开始以后，商业系统的职工鼓足干劲，大胆革新工作，改变劳动组织，加强协作，或实行一班顶到底的上班制度，服务性质提高，人员还可以大量减少。根据各商业单位的初步计划，全市可以减少商业人员约四万人。
    中共天津市委根据目前工商部门出现的这种新的不平衡状况，决定从商业部门抽调职工支援工业生产。这个决定向商业部门的职工传达以后，职工们都热烈拥护，争先恐后地报名，要求到工业生产战线。各工厂职工也热烈欢迎这批新的力量，很多老工人表示要把自己的技术无保留地教给他们，使他们很快掌握生产技术。
