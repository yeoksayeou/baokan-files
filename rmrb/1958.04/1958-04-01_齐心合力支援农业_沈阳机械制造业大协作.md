    Working Together to Support Agriculture
    Shenyang's Machinery Manufacturing Industry Cooperates
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shenyang) The Shenyang machinery manufacturing industry is using cooperative methods to trial-produce 50-horsepower steam tractors, "Victory" brand three-wheeled trucks, and 3.5-horsepower gas engines, which are urgently needed for agricultural mechanization.
    Currently, a good atmosphere of mutual cooperation has formed in Shenyang's machinery manufacturing industry. For example, to support the Shenyang Automobile Assembly Plant in trial-producing three-wheeled trucks, the Shenyang Municipal First Industry Bureau organized a cooperation meeting for local mechanical and electrical factories in the city. More than 300 types of cooperative components were selected by 42 factories at that time.
    This kind of cooperation has brought the production potential of various factories into play and saved a lot of manpower and material resources. If the three-wheeled truck were produced independently by the Shenyang Automobile Assembly Plant, it would require the addition of at least 100 sets of equipment and the construction of 3,000 square meters of factory buildings, with a total investment of more than 2 million yuan, and an increase of more than 300 workers. After organizing cooperation, there is no need to add people or equipment, and the manufacturing task can be completed ahead of schedule.

    齐心合力支援农业
    沈阳机械制造业大协作
    本报沈阳电  沈阳机械制造业正在用协作的方法，试制农业机械化急需的五十马力的蒸汽拖拉机、“胜利”牌三轮卡车和三点五马力的煤气机。
    目前，沈阳机械制造业已经形成了互相协作的良好风气。例如，为支援沈阳市汽车装配厂试制三轮卡车，沈阳市第一工业局组织全市地方机电工厂举行了协作会议，三百多种协作部件当时就被四十二个工厂选去了。
    这种协作发挥了各厂的生产潜力，节省了大量人力、物力。如果三轮卡车由沈阳汽车装配厂单独生产，至少需要添置一百多套设备，建造三千平方公尺厂房，共需投资二百多万元，还要增加三百多名工人。组织协作以后，不添人不添设备，还能提前完成制造任务。	（金源清）
