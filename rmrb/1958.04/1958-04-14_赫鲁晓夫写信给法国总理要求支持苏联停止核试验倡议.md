Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th (TASS): Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, wrote to the French Prime Minister, Félix Gaillard, requesting the French government's support for the Soviet initiative to cease testing of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons beginning March 31st of this year.

Khrushchev pointed out in the letter that the continued testing of nuclear weapons explosions would promote the arms race and preparation for war, contribute to the design of new, more destructive and lethal types of nuclear weapons, and at the same time be harmful to the health of peaceful residents of all countries. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that the solution to the problem of ceasing nuclear weapons tests can no longer be delayed, because people's health cannot be subjected to irreparable harm.

The letter stated that in recent years, the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed to the United States government and the British government to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. However, so far, no agreement has been reached on resolving the issue of unconditional and immediate cessation of nuclear testing, or even on a temporary cessation of nuclear testing.

Khrushchev said in the letter that if the governments of the countries that currently possess nuclear weapons could support the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately cease nuclear weapons tests and decide to stop conducting tests, then this issue, which is deeply disturbing to the people of all countries around the world, would finally be resolved. This would be a major step forward in establishing genuine trust between countries and strengthening peace. However, if the governments of the countries that possess nuclear weapons do not respond to this decision of the Soviet government and continue to conduct atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, then, in this case, the Soviet Union will take free action on the issue of ceasing nuclear weapons tests in the interest of its own security.

    赫鲁晓夫写信给法国总理要求支持苏联停止核试验倡议
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫写信给法国总理盖伊阿，要求法国政府支持苏联的从今年3月31日起停止试验任何种类的原子武器和氢武器的创举。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中指出，继续进行核武器试验性爆炸将推动扩军备战，有助于设计新的、破坏性和杀伤力更大的各种类型的核武器的工作，同时对各国和平居民的健康有害。因此，苏联政府认为，解决关于停止核武器试验的问题再也不能拖延了，因为不能让人们的健康受到不可挽救的损害。
    信中说，最近几年来，苏联政府一再向美国政府和英国政府建议停止试验原子武器和氢武器。但是，到现在为止，还没有就解决关于无条件和毫不拖延地停止核试验问题、甚至是关于暂时停止核试验的问题达成协议。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中说，假如在目前拥有核武器的国家的政府能支持苏联的立即停止核武器试验的建议，决定停止进行试验，那么使全世界各国人民深感不安的这个问题将终于得到解决。这将在建立各国之间的真正信任和巩固和平问题上，向前迈进一大步。但是，如果拥有核武器的国家的政府不响应苏联政府的这一决定，仍继续进行原子武器和氢武器试验，那么，在这种情况下，苏联为了本国安全的利益在停止试验核武器问题上将采取自由行动。
