    Found a Key to the Great Leap Forward in Education
    ——The Experience of Jiangsu Province in Establishing Agricultural Middle Schools
    Wu Tianshi, Director of the Education Department of Jiangsu Province
    The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production requires a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in education to serve the promotion of social productivity. How can education achieve a comprehensive Great Leap Forward? The establishment of agricultural middle schools has provided us with a key, opening the door to infinitely vast possibilities. In Jiangsu Province, from March 19th to April 10th, within twenty days, 5,668 agricultural middle schools and various vocational middle schools have been established, with 6,614 classes. Among these, there are also some agricultural high schools and vocational high schools. More than 282,500 students have enrolled.
    The establishment of agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province is based on these two principles: first, education serves production, and second, schools are run by following the mass line. From the outset, the leadership made it clear that the purpose of establishing agricultural middle schools is to cultivate students to become peasants with socialist consciousness, culture, and a certain foundation of agricultural knowledge. The enrollment target for agricultural middle schools is high school graduates or young people with equivalent cultural levels. For high school graduates from previous years who are over 25 years old or who are the main labor force in their families, enrollment is temporarily postponed to avoid affecting production, and it is planned to establish spare-time peasant middle schools to appropriately meet their learning needs. School settings are small, decentralized, and diverse; teaching forms include alternate-day systems and half-day systems, decided upon through mass consultation. Teachers are primarily selected locally, including high school graduates and cadres sent to lower levels, and cadres from agricultural technology extension stations are invited to teach part-time. In cases of teacher imbalances, mutual support between regions is encouraged. The curriculum includes four subjects: politics, language, mathematics, and basic agricultural knowledge. In the second year, physiology and hygiene are added, and in the third year, basic knowledge of physics and chemistry is added. Textbooks emphasize combining theory with production and practical application. In addition to the unified textbooks printed by the province, localities can supplement textbooks themselves according to their needs and circumstances. The school system is two or three years, depending on the situation. School buildings utilize public housing, ancestral halls, and temples. Regarding funding, whoever attends school pays the fees. The leadership of the schools is the responsibility of the township Party committee and the township people's committee; education administrative departments and agricultural departments provide guidance on professional matters. Each school establishes a school affairs management committee or a board of directors to strengthen connections with the masses.
    The establishment of agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province has formed a mass cultural revolution movement. More, faster, and better results have been achieved. The current issue is how to run these schools well. From the perspective of the nature of agricultural middle schools, they are vocational middle schools run by the masses. A series of problems in the establishment process have been solved by the masses themselves. To solve a series of problems in consolidation and improvement in the future, we must continue to rely on the masses and implement the mass line. However, professional problems must be solved by professional departments. It appears that the education administrative departments must solve the following problems:
    First, in terms of leadership ideology, we must attach importance to agricultural middle schools and strengthen professional leadership over agricultural middle schools. In Jiangsu Province, there are currently over 8,000 classes in ordinary junior middle schools. This year, the number of agricultural middle school classes run by the people will reach over 8,000 after the summer vacation. In the next three years, the development speed of agricultural middle schools will surpass that of ordinary middle schools. By 1960, the number of agricultural middle school classes in Jiangsu Province will exceed one-third of that of ordinary middle schools. If we do not overcome the old, formalistic way of thinking, we will not be able to lead agricultural middle schools well.
    Second, we must do a good job in the training and improvement of teachers. From the current curriculum of agricultural middle schools, the first year will not be too difficult, the second year will be more difficult, and the third year will be even more difficult. To address the need for teachers for development, we plan to train 2,000 high school graduates from mid-April to mid-August to serve as teachers for the newly developed agricultural middle schools run by the people after the summer vacation. During the summer vacation, we will recruit 2,600 high school graduates to train for one year to serve as teachers for the second year of agricultural middle schools next year. The remaining number will be trained by each special district itself. To improve the existing teachers, we plan to require ordinary middle schools and normal schools to provide regular or irregular guidance to agricultural middle schools on professional matters. At the same time, we will open correspondence schools to allow agricultural middle school teachers to participate in correspondence learning.
    Third, we must accelerate the compilation of textbooks. We have now compiled textbooks for the first semester in language, mathematics, and basic agricultural knowledge, and we are preparing to compile textbooks for the second semester next. However, the compiled textbooks have not yet followed the mass line and need to be revised while teaching. We plan to compile all the textbooks within four years and ensure that each textbook undergoes two trial teachings and two revisions.
    Fourth, we must study the rules and regulations of agricultural middle schools. The resolution of various problems in agricultural middle schools must be adapted to local conditions and should not be forced to be uniform. However, the establishment of agricultural middle schools is a revolution in education. There are no existing rules and regulations for the school system, curriculum, teaching methods, and teacher salary and benefits, which requires us to summarize and study the experiences created by the masses in various places. In particular, the integration of teaching and production is a key issue in running agricultural middle schools well. Failure to resolve this issue will affect the consolidation and improvement of agricultural middle schools.

    找到了教育大跃进的一把钥匙
    ——江苏省创办农业中学的经验
    江苏省教育厅厅长　吴天石
    工农业生产大跃进，要求教育事业全面大跃进，以便为促进社会生产力服务。教育事业怎样才能全面大跃进呢？农业中学的创办，使我们找到了一把钥匙，打开了大门，出现了无限广阔的天地。江苏省从3月19日到4月10日二十天内，农业中学及各种职业中学已经开办起五千六百六十八所，六千六百一十四班，其中还有一部分农业高中和职业高中。有二十八万二千五百多名学生入学。
    江苏省创办农业中学根据这样两个原则：一是教育为生产服务，一是办学走群众路线。一开始，领导上就明确提出，办农业中学是要培养学生成为有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的和有一定农业基础知识的农民。农业中学的招收对象，是高小毕业生或具有相当文化程度的青少年。对于二十五岁以上的往届高小毕业生或者本人是家庭主要劳动力的，为了不影响生产，暂不招收，准备另办农民业余中学以适当满足他们学习文化的要求。学校设置采取小型分散，多种多样；教学形式，有隔日制，有半日制，由群众商量决定。师资主要是就地挑选，挑选的对象有高中毕业生、下放干部，并请农业技术推广站干部兼课，在师资不平衡的情况下，提倡地区之间互相支援；课程设政治、语文、数学、农业基础知识四门，二年级加设生理卫生，三年级加设理化常识。教材则强调结合生产，结合实际，除省统一编印外，各地可以因时因地，根据需要，自己补充教材。学制二年、三年不等。校舍是利用公房、祠堂、庙宇。经费是谁上学，谁缴费。学校的领导，均由乡党委和乡人民委员会负责；教育行政部门和农业部门在业务上给予指导。各个学校均成立校务管理委员会或校董会，以加强和群众的联系。
    江苏省创办农业中学已经形成一个群众性的文化革命运动，多、快、省是做到了，现在的问题，是如何把这些学校办好。从农业中学的性质来说，是群众自办的职业中学，开办中的一系列问题，群众都自己解决了，今后解决巩固提高中的一系列问题，仍然必须依靠群众解决，我们也必须贯彻群众路线。可是业务问题，业务部门必须解决，现在看来，教育行政部门要解决下列几个问题：
    第一，领导思想上，必须重视农业中学，加强对农业中学的业务领导。以江苏省来说，现有普通初级中学八千多班，今年民办的农业中学到暑假后就有八千多班，今后三年，农业中学发展速度，超过普通中学。到1960年，江苏省农业中学的班级将超过普通中学三分之一，如果我们不克服旧型正规化的思想，就不能领导好农业中学。
    第二，要做好教师的培养训练和提高工作。从农业中学现开课程来看，第一年困难不大，第二年困难就要多些，第三年困难要更大些。对发展需要的师资，我们准备在4月中旬至8月中旬培养训练二千高中毕业生为暑期后新发展的民办农业中学的师资。暑假中招收二千六百名高中毕业生培养一年，为明年农业中学二年级的师资，不足之数，由各专区自己训练。对现有师资的提高，我们准备规定普通中学和师范在业务上给农业中学以定期或不定期辅导，同时开办函授学校，吸收农业中学教师参加函授学习。
    第三，要加速教材的编写工作。现在我们已编好第一学期的语文、数学及农业基础知识的教材，准备接下去就编第二学期的教材。但是已编教材，还不是走的群众路线，需要边教边修订。我们计划四年之内，编好全部教材，并且使每一门教材都经过两次试教，两次修订。
    第四，要研究农业中学的规章、制度。农业中学各种问题的解决，必须因地制宜，不应强求一律。但是农业中学的创办是教育上的一个革命，学制、课程、教学方法以及教师工资待遇等，都没有现成规章，需要我们总结研究各地群众创造的经验。特别是，教学与生产相结合的问题，是办好农业中学的关键问题，解决不好，就将影响农业中学的巩固和提高。
