Great Potential for Increased Silk Production

China has a temperate climate and vast land, with very rich resources for mulberry and tussah silkworm production. Mulberry and tussah silk are China's specialties. Currently, Japan has the highest mulberry silkworm cocoon and silk production in the world, and China is second; China has the highest tussah silkworm cocoon and silk production, accounting for more than 80% of the world's total. As early as more than four thousand years ago, our ancestors knew how to plant mulberry trees, raise silkworms, reel silk, and weave silk. China's mulberry silkworms are distributed in nearly a thousand counties in twenty-two provinces, with existing mulberry garden area of ​​5.66 million mu, of which Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Guangdong are the main mulberry silkworm producing areas. Tussah silkworms are distributed in more than two hundred counties in sixteen provinces, with existing tussah forest area of ​​more than 80 million mu, of which Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, and Guizhou are famous tussah silkworm producing areas.

Although China's silk production has a long history, it suffered severe damage during the reactionary ruling era, especially during the Japanese invaders' rule. In the early days of liberation, the country's mulberry garden area was less than three million mu, and the output of mulberry silkworm cocoons dropped to more than 600,000 dan; the output of tussah silkworm cocoons dropped to more than 500,000 dan, only 15%-27% of the highest annual output before the war.

Since the founding of New China, the silk industry has been rapidly restored. In 1957, the total output of mulberry silkworm cocoons was 1,334,000 dan, 198% of the 674,000 dan in 1950; the total output of tussah silkworm cocoons was 805,000 dan, 160% of the 500,000 dan in 1950; the total output of raw silk was more than 6,000 tons, 272% of the 2,200 tons in 1950; the total output of silk was more than 110 million meters, 550% of the 20 million meters in 1950.

Due to the development of silk production, farmers' income has increased. In recent years, the income from silkworm production in agricultural cooperatives in key producing areas has accounted for more than 30% of the total income, with an average annual silkworm raising income of 30 to 50 yuan per household.

However, the production development during the first five-year plan period still lags far behind the needs. The output of mulberry silkworm cocoons in 1957 increased by only 8% compared with 1952, only reaching 30% of the highest output before the war, and 56.8% of Japan's total output. In particular, the output in key producing areas has declined to a certain extent in recent years; the output of tussah silkworm cocoons in 1957 decreased compared with 1952, and only about one-eighth of the existing area of ​​tussah forests was utilized.

At present, the average unit cocoon yield per mu of mulberry gardens in China is very uneven. The national average cocoon yield per mu is only 40 jin, only about 50% of Japan's. However, the unit yield in some areas has exceeded Japan. There are already thirty-one counties with an average cocoon yield of more than 80 jin per mu nationwide; the average cocoon yield in Guangdong Province has reached 118 jin per mu. These situations show that the potential for mulberry and tussah cocoon production in China is very large.

### 蚕丝增产潜力很大

    蚕丝增产潜力很大
    我国气候温和，土地辽阔，桑、柞蚕生产资源非常丰富。桑、柞蚕丝是我国的特产，目前世界桑蚕茧丝产量日本最高，我国是第二位；柞蚕茧丝产量我国是第一位，占世界总产量的80％以上。早在四千多年以前，我们的祖先就会栽桑、养蚕、缫丝、织绸。我国的桑蚕分布在二十二个省近一千个县境内，现有桑园面积五百六十六万亩，其中浙江、江苏、四川、广东是主要的桑蚕产区。柞蚕分布在十六个省二百多个县境内，现有柞林面积八千多万亩，其中辽宁、山东、河南、贵州是著名的柞蚕产区。
    我国蚕丝生产虽然历史悠久，但在反动统治时代，特别是日本侵略者统治时期，受到了严重的摧残。解放初期，全国桑园不到三百万亩，桑蚕茧产量下降到六十多万市担；柞蚕茧下降到五十多万市担，仅及战前最高年产量的15％—27％。
    新中国成立以来，蚕丝事业获得迅速恢复，1957年桑蚕茧总产量一百三十三点四万市担，为1950年六十七点四万市担的198％；柞蚕茧总产量八十点五万市担，为1950年五十万市担的160％；生丝的总产量六千多吨，为1950年二千二百多吨的272％；绸的总产量一万一千多万公尺，为1950年二千多万公尺的550％。
    由于蚕丝生产的发展，增加了农民的收入，近几年重点产区农业社蚕桑生产的收入要占总收入的30％多，平均每户一年养蚕收入有三十到五十元。
    但是第一个五年计划期间的生产发展还远远落后于需要。1957年桑蚕茧产量比1952年仅增加8％，只达战前最高产量的30％，为日本总产量的56.8％。特别是重点产区，近年来产量并有一定程度的下降；柞蚕茧产量1957年比1952年减产，柞林只利用了现有面积的八分之一左右。
    目前我国桑园平均单位产茧量高低很不平衡。全国总平均每亩产茧只有四十斤，仅及日本的50％左右。但有些地区的单位产量已超过日本。全国平均每亩产茧在八十斤以上的已有三十一个县；广东全省平均每亩产茧已达一百一十八斤。这些情况说明，我国桑柞茧生产潜力是很大的。
