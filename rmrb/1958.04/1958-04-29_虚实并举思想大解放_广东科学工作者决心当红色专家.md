Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 27th: The first Guangdong Provincial Science Work Conference, lasting eleven days, closed on the 26th. Due to the method of visiting the countryside, linking theory with practice, and combining theory with reality (both discussing political ideology and professional work), the entire conference was lively and dynamic. Hundreds of scientific workers felt ideologically liberated and their enthusiasm was heightened. They unanimously recognized that scientific work must serve production and resolved to become socialist "red scholars."

The scientific workers attending the conference believed that the three-day visit to the rural areas of Xinhui and Panyu counties was very rewarding, with significant gains in both political ideology and professional work. The great creations and revolutionary enthusiasm of the working masses made the representatives universally feel the seriousness of the past separation of scientific research work from production, reality, and the masses. Scientists raised questions at the meeting and on big-character posters: Why can the masses make many technological innovation creations under simple conditions, while scientific workers with superior conditions cannot? The scientists themselves found the answer: because the masses have "political equipment" – redness and enthusiasm, plus technology. However, the scientific workers' "equipment" was incomplete. Many scientific workers at the meeting, while visiting, wrote big-character posters to examine their thinking. Later, they spoke at the meeting to criticize various individualistic thoughts in their scientific research work, expressing their intention to be assistants and advisors to workers and peasants in the Great Leap Forward in production. Under the condition of the great ideological liberation of the scientists, the conference immediately formed professional groups for rice crops, agricultural tools, small universal tractors, citrus Huanglong disease, biogas power generation, and termite control, etc., based on the technical problems urgently needed to be solved in current industrial and agricultural production, striving to research and solve related technical problems in a short period to support the Great Leap Forward in production.

Based on the ideological leap forward of the scientific workers, the conference organized scientists to discuss the draft outline of the 1958-1962 scientific and technological research work plan proposed by the Provincial Science Work Committee, especially focusing on the specific study of this year's leap forward plan for scientific work. In this plan, which includes ten major scientific research projects, scientists confidently guaranteed to take their respective positions and cooperate with the people of the province to make Guangdong achieve an average grain yield of 800 jin per mu by 1962, an increase of 290 jin compared with 1957, and strive to become a "thousand-jin province." At the same time, they will actively research and develop the abundant resources of the subtropical region, develop sugarcane production into the main base in the country, and strive to promote the Great Leap Forward in forestry, aquaculture, fruits, and sericulture in scientific work. In industrial production, the representatives also resolved to fully exert the power of science and technology, cooperate with the people of the province to quadruple the province's output value in five years, and basically realize industrialization. Philosophy and social science researchers also demanded to resolutely implement the spirit of combining theory with practice and emphasizing the present over the past, focusing on studying and summarizing Guangdong's current revolutionary practical experience and various historical and cultural heritages. The meeting emphasized that in carrying out these scientific research works, Guangdong Province should pay attention to cooperation with relevant regions and the whole country.

Chen Yu, Governor of Guangdong Province and Director of the Science Work Committee, gave a concluding report at the closing meeting. He hoped that scientists would continue to work hard to solve their ideological standpoint problems, clarify the direction of science serving socialist construction, and strive to complete this glorious task. He said: Scientists should live equally among the masses, humbly learn from the masses' enthusiasm and various creations, and actively help them summarize and improve. Only in this way can scientific workers truly serve production and become socialist scholars!

At the meeting on the 23rd, Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended and spoke. He emphasized that while actively solving the problem of standpoint and viewpoint, scientific workers should go to the masses and to reality in order to achieve great ideological liberation and do a good job in scientific research.

    虚实并举思想大解放
    广东科学工作者决心当红色专家
    据新华社广州27日电　历时十一天的广东省第一次科学工作会议在26日闭幕。会议由于采取下乡参观，理论联系实际；虚实并举，既谈政治思想又谈业务的方法，整个会议开得生动活泼。几百位科学工作者都感到思想解放，干劲提高，一致认识到科学工作必须为生产服务，决心要当上社会主义的红色秀才。
    出席会议的科学工作者认为，在会议期间到新会、番禺两县农村历时三天的访问收获很大，政治思想和业务方面都满载而归。劳动群众的伟大创造和革命干劲，使代表们普遍的感到过去科学研究工作脱离生产、脱离实际、脱离群众的严重性。科学家们在会议上、在大字报上纷纷提出问题：为什么群众在简陋的条件下能够作出许多技术革新的创造，而条件优越的科学工作者却办不到？科学家们自己找到了答案：因为群众有“政治设备”——红和干劲，再加上技术。而科学工作者却“设备”不全。许多科学工作者在会议中，一边参观一边写了大字报检查思想，以后又纷纷在会议上发言批判自己在科学工作研究中的各式各样的个人主义思想。表示今后在生产大跃进中要给工人、农民当助手、当参谋。会议就在科学家们思想大解放的情况下，根据目前工农业生产中迫切需要解决的技术问题，立刻组成水稻作物、农具、小型万能拖拉机、柑桔黄龙病、沼气发电和防治白蚂蚁等专业小组，争取在短期间内研究解决有关的技术问题，以支援生产大跃进。
    在科学工作者们思想跃进的基础上，会议根据省科学工作委员会提出的1958—1962年科学技术研究工作规划纲要草案，组织科学家们进行讨论，特别是具体研究了今年科学工作的跃进规划。在这个包括有十项科学研究工作大项目的规划中，科学家们满怀信心地保证要各就各位，协同全省人民使广东到1962年平均每亩粮食产量达到八百斤，比1957年增产二百九十斤，并争取成为“千斤省”；同时积极研究开发亚热带地区丰富资源，把糖蔗生产发展成为全国的主要基地，并且在科学工作方面要努力促进林业、水产、水果和蚕丝等方面的大跃进。在工业生产上，代表们也决心充分发挥科学技术方面的威力，协同全省人民促使本省在五年提高产值四倍，基本实现工业化。哲学社会科学研究工作者们也要求坚决贯彻理论结合实际和厚今薄古的精神，着重研究和总结广东当前的革命实践经验和各种历史文化遗产。会议强调在进行这些科学研究工作时，广东省要注意和有关地区和全国方面的协作。
    广东省长兼科学工作委员会主任陈郁，在闭幕会议上作了总结报告。他希望科学家们继续努力解决自己的思想立场问题，明确科学为社会主义建设服务的方向，努力完成这个光荣的任务。他说：科学家要平等地生活在群众之中，虚心学习群众的干劲和各种创造，而又积极帮助他们进行总结提高。科学工作者只有这样，才能真正为生产服务，当上社会主义的秀才！
    在23日的会议上，中共广东省委第一书记陶铸曾出席会议讲了话。他强调科学工作者在积极解决立场观点问题的同时，要到群众中去，到实际中去，才能使思想大解放，做好科学研究工作。
