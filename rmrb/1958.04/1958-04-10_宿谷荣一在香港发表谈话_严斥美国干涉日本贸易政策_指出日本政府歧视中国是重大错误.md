Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 9th: Eiichi Sukuya, Vice Chairman of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade and Director-General of the Japan Commodity Exhibition, criticized the United States in Hong Kong on the 8th for interfering in Japan's trade policy.

Sukuya Eiichi said: Since Japan is already an independent country, it should independently develop foreign trade. The fact that the United States is exerting pressure on the Japanese government on the issue of Japan-China trade is tantamount to interfering in Japan's foreign trade policy, which is also interfering in Japan's internal affairs.

Sukuya Eiichi, after presiding over the opening ceremony of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition in Wuhan, returned to Japan via Hong Kong on the 8th. At a press conference, he also said that the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement has made provisions for the mutual dispatch of non-governmental commercial representative offices. However, some people in the Japanese government have expressed that they cannot guarantee that the Chinese national flag in Japan will be respected and that Chinese trade representatives in Japan will receive definite security guarantees. He said, "This attitude of the Japanese government is a major mistake and it is extremely inappropriate." Sukuya Eiichi pointed out that at the Japanese Commodity Exhibition in Wuhan, the Japanese national flag and Japanese staff were respected by the Chinese people, and Japanese people currently visiting, traveling, and residing in China do not feel unsafe at all. "When they think about this situation, and then look at the Japanese government's attitude towards China, they feel very sad. They feel very sorry for China."

Sukuya Eiichi pointed out that the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement is a document representing the opinions of all Japanese parties, including people from the ruling party. Troubles arose after the signing, and this matter has affected the sense of trust on both sides. Since Japan's goal is to engage in economic exchanges with China, how can exchanges be realized without mutual trust? Therefore, once the agreement is signed, it should be implemented. He said that Japanese groups will demand that the government fulfill the aforementioned agreement.

When talking about the attitude of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan on this issue, Sukuya Eiichi said: "Even if we sever all relations with Taiwan, we should trade with China, because China has 600 million people, and for the sake of Asian peace, we must be friendly with the Chinese people."

    宿谷荣一在香港发表谈话
    严斥美国干涉日本贸易政策
    指出日本政府歧视中国是重大错误
    据新华社香港9日电　日本国际贸易促进协会副会长、日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一8日在香港指责美国干涉日本的贸易政策。
    宿谷荣一说：日本既然已是一个独立国家，就应该独立发展对外贸易。美国在日中贸易问题上竟然对日本政府施加压力，这就等于干涉日本的对外贸易政策，也就是干涉日本的内政。
    宿谷荣一在武汉主持日本商品展览会开幕礼后，8日取道香港返日本。他在记者招待会上还说，第四次日中贸易协定已作了互派民间商务代表机构的规定。但是，日本政府中一部分人员表示不能保证在日本的中国国旗受到尊重和在日本的中国贸易代表受到确切安全保障的态度。他说，“日本政府这种态度实在是重大错误，太不应该了”。宿谷荣一指出，在武汉日本商品展览会上，日本国旗和日本工作人员都受到中国人民的尊重，目前在中国访问、旅行和居留的日本人，他们一点都没有不安全的感觉。“他们想想这种情形，再看看日本政府对中国的态度，心里觉得很难过。觉得太对不起中国了”。
    宿谷荣一指出，第四次日中贸易协定是一个代表日本各党派包括执政党人士意见的文件。签字之后又发生麻烦，这件事影响了双方的信赖感。日本方面的目标既是要和中国实行经济交流，如果没有彼此间的信赖，又怎能实现交往？所以，协定既经签字，就应该予以实行。他说，日本团体将要求政府履行上述协议。
    谈到台湾蒋介石集团对这一问题的态度时，宿谷荣一说：“即使和台湾断绝一切关系，也应该和中国贸易，这是因为中国有六亿人口，为了亚洲和平，一定要和中国人民友好相处”。
