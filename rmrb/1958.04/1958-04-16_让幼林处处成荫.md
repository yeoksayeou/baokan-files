Shaanxi: Implement Specialized Responsibility System for Afforestation and Forest Protection with Quantity and Quality Verification
    Leading departments at all levels in Shaanxi Province have implemented a specialized responsibility system for afforestation and forest protection, universally assisting agricultural cooperatives in establishing specialized afforestation and forest protection organizations. In key afforestation cooperatives, forestry professional teams were established; general agricultural cooperatives also designated specialized afforestation personnel responsible for seed collection, seedling cultivation, watering, fertilization, and management and maintenance. Simultaneously, most agricultural cooperatives throughout the province implemented a method of equal pay for agricultural and forestry work, unified work point recording, and profit distribution in the same year. For example, agricultural cooperatives in various counties of the Ankang Special District, in the large-scale development of tung oil trees this spring, universally implemented a method of payment in installments. Generally, it is stipulated that after the seedlings emerge and survive, one-third of the total remuneration is paid first. After the tung oil trees blossom, the agricultural cooperative conducts acceptance based on the stipulated quantity and quality. If the quantity is completed well and the quality meets the specifications, the remuneration for cultivation management and maintenance will be paid in full. In this way, members are concerned not only about the emergence and survival of tung oil trees but also about flowering and fruiting.
    According to inspections, in areas where these measures have been implemented, the survival rate of tree planting can generally be guaranteed to reach about 90%.

Sichuan: “Three Guarantees, Four Determinations” Improve Survival Rate
    Sichuan Province planted a total of more than 28 million mu of forests during a recent "Tree Planting Campaign Month," averaging nearly one million mu of afforestation per day.
    In Luzhou, Nanchong, Suining and other special districts, due to the universal implementation of the "Three Guarantees (guarantee planting, guarantee survival, guarantee management) and Four Determinations (determine quality, determine quantity, determine work points, determine time)," the quality of planted trees has significantly exceeded previous years. According to inspections, the survival rate of trees in many areas such as Tongjiang, Gulin, and Dazhou has reached over 90%.
    Sichuan's "Tree Planting Campaign Month" was carried out from the Awakening of Insects to the Qingming Festival. Workers, peasants, and people of all strata participated in this movement.

Hebei: Establish Forest Protection Pledges and Management Measures
    After achieving initial victories in afforestation, many areas in Hebei Province are inspecting the quality of newly planted saplings.
    On April 5, the Handan Special District mobilized more than 13,400 agricultural cooperative members around Zishan Mountain to go up the mountain to manage newly planted saplings by cultivating and watering them. At the same time, they replanted more than 170,000 trees and reorganized more than 6,800 fish-scale pits. On the 5th, the Xingtai Special District dispatched a inspection team of 20 people, including heads and forestry section chiefs from county agricultural and forestry bureaus, to various counties to inspect afforestation and forest protection work. After completing the afforestation task, Anci County universally launched a campaign to check quantity, check quality, establish forest protection pledges, and formulate management measures.
    As of April 8, Hebei Province had afforested more than 19.1 million mu, basically completing the annual afforestation plan. The number of afforestation and tree planting in more than a month exceeded the total of the past eight years.

Gansu: Plant Various Peaches, Apricots, Mulberries, and Poplars to Beautify Rural Courtyards
    In order to beautify the living environment, farmers in Qin'an County, a dry mountainous area in eastern Gansu Province, have planted economic trees such as grapes, peaches, pears, apricots, apples, Chinese prickly ash, redbuds, mulberries, poplars, and bamboos in 46,000 rural courtyards.
    Yunshan Township was the first to do so. Now, when people enter the courtyard of every farmer in this township, they will see fruit trees filling the courtyard, with fresh green leaves and white walls and red doors reflecting each other. The Emei Agricultural Cooperative planted an average of five fruit trees and 129 bamboos in each courtyard. The women of this cooperative composed a folk song to praise it: "Many fruit trees, mulberries, and bamboos in one courtyard, great benefits in three to five years, bees making honey in spring, cool green shade in summer, red apples fill the yard, grapes in bunches, mulberries yield silk, bamboos evergreen."

Shandong: Divide Areas and Assign Responsibilities, Guarantee Planting and Survival
    Shandong Province has adopted methods such as leading cadres taking the lead, comprehensive mobilization, long-term preparation, short-term arrangements, division of areas and assignment of responsibilities, and guaranteeing planting and survival, making afforestation work fast and good. As of the 5th, the province had afforested a total of 2,518,251 mu, completing 157% of the original plan. Including the amount of afforestation last winter and sporadic tree planting this spring, the province's afforestation area has exceeded 4 million mu, and 17 counties and cities have basically completed the afforestation task.
    In areas where the spring afforestation is basically over, the work has now shifted to seed collection, seedling cultivation, land preparation and forest protection. Xintai County has required every full-time cadre of county-level agencies to cultivate 1,000 to 1,500 seedlings, and each person's seedling land is marked with a sign. Longting Township in this county has achieved more than 1,000 seedlings cultivated by each household. (Xinhua News Agency)

    让幼林处处成荫
    陕　西：造林护林专责制数量质量都验收
    陕西省各级领导部门推行了造林、护林专责制，普遍帮助农业社成立造林、护林专业组织。在造林重点社成立林业专业队；一般农业社也指定专责造林人，负责采种、育苗、浇水、施肥和管理养护工作。与此同时，全省大部分农业社实行了农林同工同酬、统一记工、当年分红的办法。如安康专区各县的农业社在今春大量发展油桐中，普遍推行了分期付酬的办法。一般规定在出苗成活后，先付报酬总额三分之一，油桐放花后，由农业社按规定的数量和质量验收，如果数量完成得好，质量又合乎规格，再付清抚育管理和养护用工的报酬。这样，社员就既关心油桐的出苗成活，也关心开花结果。
    据检查，凡是执行了这些措施的地方，植树的成活率一般能保证达到90％左右。
    四川：三包四定制成活率提高
    四川省在最近结束的一次“植树造林运动月”内，共造林二千八百多万亩，平均每天造林近一百万亩。
    泸州、南充、遂宁等专区由于普遍实行“三包（包种、包活、包管）、四定（定质、定量、定工分、定时间）”的办法，种植林木的质量显著地超过往年。据检查，通江、古蔺、达县等许多地区林木成活率达到90％以上。
    四川这次“植树造林运动月”，是从惊蛰到清明这一段期间开展的。参加这一运动的有工人、农民和各阶层人民。
    河　北：订护林公约订管理措施
    河北省不少地区在取得植树造林的初步胜利以后，正在检查新植幼林的质量。
    邯郸专区在4月5日发动紫山周围一万三千四百多个农业社员，上山对新植的幼树进行加工、浇水等管理工作，同时补种了十七万多株树，重新整理了六千八百多个鱼鳞坑。邢台专区5日抽调各县农林局长、林业科长等共二十人，组成检查团，分赴各县检查造林护林工作。安次县完成造林任务后，又普遍开展查数量、查质量、订护林公约、订管理措施的运动。
    河北省到4月8日止共造林一千九百一十万多亩，基本完成了全年的造林计划。一个多月内造林和植树数字超过了八年来的总和。
    甘　肃：多种桃杏桑杨  美化农村庭院
    甘肃省东部干旱山区秦安县农民为了美化生活环境，已经在四万六千个农村庭院内种植了葡萄、桃、梨、杏、苹果、花椒、紫荆、桑树、白杨、竹子等经济林木。
    云山乡是最先这样做的。现在当人们走进这个乡每个农民的庭院里，都会看到果树满院，鲜嫩的绿叶和白墙红门掩映夺目。峨嵋农业社平均每个庭院栽了五株果树，一百二十九株竹子。这个社的妇女编了一首山歌来赞美道：“一院果木桑竹多，三年五载收益大，春天蜜蜂酿，夏来绿荫凉，苹果满院红，葡萄串疙瘩，桑树吊蚕丝，竹子万年青”。
    山　东：分片包干  包栽包活
    山东省采取领导人带头、全面发动、长准备、短安排、分片包干、包栽包活等办法，植树造林工作做得又快又好。到5日止，全省共已造林二百五十一万八千二百五十一亩，完成原计划157％。连同去冬造林和今春零星植树的数量，全省造林面积已超过四百万亩，有十七个县市已基本完成造林任务。
    在春季造林大体结束的地区，目前已转入采种育苗和整地护林工作。新泰县已要求县级机关每个脱产干部育苗一千到一千五百株，每人的育苗地都插上牌子。这个县的龙亭乡已做到户户育一千株以上。（据新华社讯）
