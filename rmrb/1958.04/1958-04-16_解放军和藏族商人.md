    The People's Liberation Army and Tibetan Merchants
    Yi Ge Mu Yi Zhuoma
    One morning in February, a Tibetan merchant in his forties, with immense gratitude, saw off a Han Chinese customer from his shop, repeatedly saying, "Wonderful! Wonderful!"

    This merchant, named Zaxi Luobu, was a small businessman in Lhasa. On the afternoon of February 14th, Lao Yang, an assistant from a certain unit of the Tibet Military Region, came to Zaxi's shop to buy a batch of milk powder for public use and bought a box at the agreed-upon real price.

    After returning to his unit, he opened the wooden box and found that there were sixty cans of milk powder, worth 180 silver dollars, but the merchant had only charged ninety. Lao Yang thought that the merchant must have miscalculated and immediately reported it to Director Yang in his department. The instruction he received was: if the seller had given too much milk powder, he should promptly return it to the merchant or make up the difference in silver dollars. However, the sun had already set, and it would be more than twenty li round trip to return the silver dollars to the merchant immediately, and transportation was inconvenient. Finally, the suggestion of the Tibetan translator was adopted to return the full amount the next day.

    The next day, because Lao Yang had to attend a meeting at home, he entrusted Lao Xu from his unit to handle the matter of returning the silver dollars. When Lao Xu arrived at Zaxi Luobu's house, he told Zaxi the whole story of returning the silver dollars. At this time, Zaxi was so moved that he almost burst into tears. Zaxi also told Lao Xu that his wife had complained to her husband the night before that he had miscalculated and lost money, and they had quarreled fiercely. At that time, Zaxi had said with confidence, "Please believe me, the People's Liberation Army will return these ninety silver dollars to us!"

    Sure enough, as Zaxi Luobu had expected, the ninety silver dollars were delivered to the home of the merchant Zaxi Luobu on the morning of February 15th.

    解放军和藏族商人
    弋戈　穆伊卓玛
    2月间的一个上午，一个四十多岁的藏族商人，怀着无比感激的心情，从他的铺子里送出一位汉族客人，并口口声声地说：“太好了！太好了！”
    这位商人名叫札西罗布，是拉萨市内的一个小座商。2月14日下午，西藏军区某部助理员老杨给公家买一批奶粉，来到了札西的铺子，按议定实价买了一箱。
    回到本单位后，打开木箱一看，发现共有奶粉六十筒，该值大洋一百八十元，而商人却只要了九十元。老杨心想，这一定是商人算错了账，当即向处里杨处长反映，得到的指示是：如卖主多给了奶粉，应及时退给商人或补足大洋。然而这时太阳已经落山了，如果要马上将大洋送回商人，往返共有二十余里，且交通不便。最后还是采纳藏族翻译的意见，在第二天如数送回。
    第二天，因老杨要在家开会，送大洋的事就托本单位老许专办。老许到了札西罗布的家，就将送回大洋的来龙去脉告诉札西。这时札西感动得几乎流下了眼泪。札西还告诉老许说：妻子昨晚就埋怨丈夫算错了账，亏了本，大吵大闹。当时，札西还胸有成竹似地说：“请你相信，解放军会将这九十元送回给我们的！”
    果然，不出札西罗布的预料，九十个大洋在2月15日的上午送到了商人札西罗布的家里。
