Some people have made up three sayings for us, saying that we are "doing future things now, poor people doing rich people's things, and laymen doing expert things." This is nothing more than criticizing us for overestimating our capabilities.

What does it mean to "do future things now"? For example, if a five-year plan is completed in the second year, is that called "doing future things now"? Some people say yes. Because, according to the plan, what should be done today has already been done, and doing more seems like doing future things.

Our view is different. We believe that as long as something already has the conditions to be done today, and there is a possibility of completing it, regardless of whether the plan stipulates that it should be done now, it has actually become a present matter and is no longer a future matter. If we don't complete it now, it's laziness and dereliction of duty. Therefore, there is actually only the possibility of doing yesterday's things today, and there is no possibility of doing tomorrow's things today. After the peasants built water conservancy projects on a large scale, they said that we did in one year what our ancestors had done in thousands of years, not that we did what we would do in the next ten or hundred years, because they understood that next year we would do even more than this year.

In our view, such things will happen frequently, and it's a good thing. But the "critics" think it's a bad thing, perhaps because they are afraid that we will take over the work of future generations, which will cause unemployment for our descendants?

The "critics" may say: we have misinterpreted their meaning, their original intention is that we always want to do some impossible things. This is sophistry, because first, it's impossible to find examples from the things we have already done, because everything that has been accomplished proves that it is possible to accomplish; second, they cannot find examples from the things we want to do, because, since the things have not been done yet, how can we know that they are impossible to do?

"Poor people doing rich people's things" is also not overestimating our capabilities. It is a fact that we are poor. But it is also an age-old truth that the poorer people are, the more capable they are. Looking at history, there are almost no praiseworthy things done by rich people that are worthy of future generations' praise. When people are poor, their ambitions are not poor, their talents are not poor, and their strength is not poor, so they can do things more, faster, better, and more economically. Poor people have many methods. Take the many creations that have recently emerged in industrial and agricultural production, all of which came from poor methods. We have not been discouraged by poverty. We do not sit and wait for the rich to bestow things upon us like empty-headed "critics," and fantasize about begging for scraps from the bourgeoisie; nor do we dream of starting a business after picking up gold. Instead, we will rely on our wisdom and labor to make mountains bow and rivers give way. The fact is that many things that the rich cannot do, we have done, and we have done them wonderfully.

According to these "critics," it seems that the rich should be thicker-waisted, braver, and walk with their heads held high, oblivious to everyone else. And what about the poor? They should have a poor look, appear humble, have small hands and feet, speak less, and do less. Only then will they be in accordance with their status, otherwise it will be overestimating their capabilities.

In fact, what they prescribe for the poor is a set of slave features. Poverty and slavery are not the same. Moreover, slaves with a strong spirit of resistance are different from the slaves they prescribe. As for the Chinese people today, they have become masters of their own houses, so naturally they want to raise their eyebrows and exhale, and show their talents. What's so strange?

Speaking of laymen being able to do expert things, this is a great thing. A few days ago, the newspaper published a very interesting piece of news, saying that the peasants in Jinghai County had created the experience of using plain water power to generate electricity: "People boldly carried out experiments. Without ready-made blueprints, the Party负责人 and technicians who had not designed power stations worked together with local ironworkers, carpenters, and tilers to build and design at the same time. As a result, it only took nine days. When the designer did not have time to produce the blueprints, these power stations broke through the darkness on the evening of the Lantern Festival on the lunar calendar—the fifteenth day of the first month—and emitted light for the first time in the rural areas of the plain." This is a good example of "laymen doing expert things." This is not ridiculous, but very valuable. Because this is daring to do. As long as you are willing to do it, you will definitely become an expert. "Laymen doing expert things" is at least much better than experts doing nothing, right? Those who think they are experts, are unwilling to do things, and want to say sarcastic remarks and pour cold water on those who do things, are even worse, right?

Here, two basic views are reflected. One is to look down on the strength of the Chinese people and always feel that we are not good enough, using a smaller size to measure us, and always feel that we have exceeded our limits. One is to completely believe in our own strength. Because we understand a few things: such a large country has so many diligent, smart, and capable people; so many people are living under such a system that has completely liberated the productive forces; and they are also led by such a pragmatic Party. When these few things are concentrated, they will inevitably form an inexhaustible ocean of power. "The sea cannot be measured with a bushel," isn't this also an old saying? Is it that we are overestimating our capabilities, or is their measure wrong? Isn't this obvious?

    海水不可斗量
    阮延顺
    有人给我们编了三句话，说是“现在办将来的事，穷人办阔人的事，外行办内行的事。”这番话无非是批评我们不自量力。
    什么叫“现在办将来的事”？比如说，订了一个五年的计划，在第二年就把它完成了，这叫不叫“现在办将来的事”？有人说是。因为，按照计划，今天应做的事已经做完了，再要做便好像是做将来的事了。
    我们的看法不同，认为只要这件事在今天已经具备了要办的条件，有了完成的可能性，不管计划中有没有规定现在就办，它实际上已经成了现在的事，不再是将来的事了，如果现在不去完成它，就是偷懒和失职。因此，实际上只有今天办昨天的事的可能，而并不存在今天办明天的事的可能部分。农民们在大修水利之后说，我们一年干了祖先们几千年内干的事情，并不说我们一年就干了今后十年或者是百年的事情，因为他们明白，到第二年会比今年干的还要多。
    在我们看来，这样的事是经常会有，而且是好事。可是“批评家”却认为是坏事，莫非是怕我们包办了后代子孙的工作，因而会造成子孙们的失业么？
    “批评家”也许要说：我们曲解了他的意思，他的原意，是指我们老想办一些不可能的事。这是诡辩，因为第一，无法从我们已经办过的事中找出例证来，因为凡是已办成的事，都证明是可能办成的事；第二，他也无法从我们要办的事中找出例证来，因为，事情还没有办，又怎么就能知道这是不可能办成的呢？
    “穷人办阔人的事”也并非不自量。我们穷是事实。但人越穷越能办事，也是自古以来的真理。查查历史，由阔人们办出的值得后人称道的事，几乎没有。人穷志不穷、才不穷、力不穷，就能把事办得又多又快又好又省。穷人办法多，就拿最近工农业生产上不断出现的许多创造来说，都是出自穷办法。我们并没有因穷志短，既不像空头“批评家”们那样坐待阔人的赐予，幻想向资产阶级讨点残羹剩饭；也并不梦想拾得黄金以后才去着手建立家业，而是要凭我们的智慧、劳动，使高山低头、河水让路。事实是阔人们办不到的许多事，我们办出来了，而且办得呱呱叫。
    依这些“批评家”的看法，好像阔人就应该腰粗些，胆壮些，昂首阔步，旁若无人。而穷人呢？就应该有一副穷相，要显得寒伧些，低眉下气些，小手小脚些，话要说得少，事要办得少，这才合乎身份，否则就是不自量。
    其实他们给穷人规定的是一套奴才相。穷和奴隶并不一样。何况富有反抗精神的奴隶同他们规定的奴才又不一样。至于我们现在的中国人，已是当了家做了主，自然要扬眉吐气，大显身手了。有什么奇怪？
    说到外行能办内行的事，这是件大好事。前几天报纸上登过一个很有意思的消息，说静海县的农民们创造了利用平原水力发电的经验：“人们大胆进行了试验，没有现成的图纸，党的负责人和没有作过电站设计的技术员，就和当地的铁、木、瓦匠一起动手，边建设，边设计。结果，只用了九天的时间，当设计师还没有来得及拿出图纸的时候，这些发电站就在农历灯节——正月十五的晚上冲破黑暗，第一次在平原的农村发出了光明”。这真是一个“外行办内行事”的好例子。这并不可笑，而是很可贵。因为这是敢干。只要肯干，就一定能变成内行。“外行办内行事”，起码要比内行不办事强的多吧？那些自以为是内行，不肯办事，还要说风凉话，给办事的人泼冷水，就更不好了吧？
    这里，反映了两种基本看法。一种是十分瞧不起中国人的力量，总觉得我们不行，用压小了的尺码来量我们，老是觉得我们超过了分寸。一种是完全相信自己的力量。因为我们明白这么几件事情：这样大的一个国家，有这样多的勤奋、聪明而又能干的人；这么多的人又是生活在这样一种完全解放了生产力的制度下；而且又受着这样一个实事求是的政党的领导，这几件事一集中，就必然组成永无枯竭的力量的海洋。“海水不可斗量”，这难道不也是一句老话吗？究竟是我们不自量呢，还是他们的量码不对呢？这不是明明白白的事吗？
