Go See the Play "Red Storm"!
	Yuan Shuipai
"Red Storm" is great! Worth seeing for everyone. This isn't just watching a play; it's time flowing backward. The living history of thirty years ago unfolds before your eyes! The "February 7th" Workers' Movement is like the rolling waves of the Yangtze River; the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese proletariat soars to the sky. No matter how cruel the warlords and traitors are, the heroic Communists will never yield; no matter how insidious the imperialists are, relentless history will eventually send you to your graves. Listen! Shi Yang's incomparably sharp speech will forever resonate in our ears! Look! The statue of Lin Xiangqian in the red light will forever be engraved in our hearts! Go see a revolutionary play and receive a revolutionary baptism!

    看话剧“红色风暴”去！
    袁水拍“红色风暴”好！值得大家瞧。这哪里是看一场戏，这是时间倒流，眼前展开了三十年前的活历史！“二七”工人运动像长江的滚滚波涛，中国无产阶级的革命浩气上冲云霄。凭你军阀汉奸多么残酷，英勇的共产党人决不屈服；凭你帝国主义者多么阴险，无情的历史终究要送你们归天。听呀！锋利无比的施洋的演讲，它将永远在我们耳边震荡！看呀！红光里的林祥谦的塑像，他将永远刻印在我们心上！去看一场革命戏，受一次革命的洗礼！
