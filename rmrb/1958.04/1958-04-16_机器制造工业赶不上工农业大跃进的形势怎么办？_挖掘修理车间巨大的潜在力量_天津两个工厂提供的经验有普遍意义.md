What to Do When the Machine Manufacturing Industry Cannot Keep Up with the Great Leap Forward in Agriculture and Industry?
	Tap the Enormous Potential of Repair Workshops
	The Experiences of Two Factories in Tianjin Offer Universal Significance

	(Our newspaper, Tianjin, 15th) This year, the repair workshop of the Tianjin Paper Mill will manufacture a large number of complete sets of papermaking equipment to support some counties in Taiyuan, Jinan, Yunnan, and Hebei.

	The repair workshop of this factory has relatively old equipment, but veteran workers of grades five to eight account for more than 30%. In the past, they were only responsible for the factory's machine repairs and the manufacture of some spare parts. Their strength was not fully utilized, and they often idled. This year, the repair workshop accepted manufacturing tasks for the first time. After more than a month of effort, they used 80% old materials and 20% new materials to produce two small papermaking machines with a daily output of two tons of paper and one wet pulp machine. Then they accepted the task of manufacturing a long-net papermaking machine with a daily output of thirty tons of paper. In this way, not only was the phenomenon of idling eliminated, but the repair workshop also took a technical leap forward, transforming a workshop that simply repaired machines into one that could both repair and manufacture.

	Because their manufactured small papermaking machines are cheap and suitable for small papermaking plants, the leadership has decided to add some machinery and equipment to this workshop and expand it into a papermaking machine repair and assembly plant, mass-producing papermaking machines to support industrial construction in special districts and counties. The expansion task will be completed in the first half of the year. By then, its manufacturing capacity will be three times higher than at present, and it will be able to manufacture papermaking machines with a daily output of one hundred tons and fifteen or sixteen kinds of machines for the entire papermaking process.

	Furthermore, the employees of the Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Factory have put forward a revolutionary proposal to the repair departments of various factories in Tianjin. They want to squeeze out a quarter of their time to process for outside factories and trial-produce and produce machinery and equipment to support the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, while ensuring the completion of the factory's maintenance tasks. Within two years, they will update their own machinery and equipment, and free up the original equipment to support the establishment of a machine repair factory in the countryside.

	Now the repair department of this factory has undertaken many processing tasks for outside factories. They are rushing to manufacture more than one hundred parts for waterwheels and water pumps for the ethnic agricultural cooperative in the suburbs of Tianjin, manufacturing ten colloid mills for four units including the Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory, and transferring six maintenance workers to support fraternal factories.

	The repair department of this factory has a total of ten old machine tools and twenty-seven employees, undertaking the repair tasks of 250,000 meters of dyeing cloth machines and 200 weaving machines per day. In the past, because the production potential was not fully tapped, some repair work was often entrusted to outside factories for processing. During the "Double Anti" movement, employees proposed: while ensuring the undertaking of the factory's machine repair tasks, they must also squeeze out time to process for outside factories. Examples of improving tools and improving operations continue to emerge. For example, the major repair of the weaving room in the factory requires the processing of 10,000 screws, which will take three and a half months to complete. Turner Yao Guoliang improved the tools, increasing production efficiency by four and a half times. In the past, the shaft core of weaving machine parts was made by hand using steel files, but now it is changed to milling with a lathe, increasing efficiency by nearly six times. (Shu Di)

    机器制造工业赶不上工农业大跃进的形势怎么办？
    挖掘修理车间巨大的潜在力量
    天津两个工厂提供的经验有普遍意义
    本报天津15日电　天津造纸总厂修理车间今年将制造大批整套的造纸设备，支援太原、济南、云南和河北的一些县。
    这个厂的修理车间，设备比较陈旧，但工人中五级至八级的老工人占30％以上。过去只负责本厂机器检修和制造一部分备件，力量就没有充分发挥，并且经常窝工。今年，这个修理车间便第一次接受制造任务。经过一个多月的努力，他们用80％的旧料和20％的新料，制成了两台日产两吨纸的小型造纸机和一台湿浆机。接着他们又接受了制造一台日产三十吨纸的长网造纸机的任务。这样，不但消灭了窝工现象，并使修理车间在技术上跃进了一步，把一个单纯修理机器的车间，变成为既能修理又能制造的车间。
    因为他们制造的小型造纸机便宜，适合小型造纸厂使用，领导部门已经决定给这个车间增添一些机器设备，扩建成造纸机器修配场，大量生产造纸机，支援专区和县的工业建设。扩建任务将在上半年完成，到那时，它的制造能力将比目前提高三倍，并能制造日产一百吨的造纸机和整个造纸过程的十五、六种机器。
    又讯　天津市织染厂职工，向天津各厂修理部门提出一项革命性的倡议，要在保证完成全厂的检修任务外，挤出四分之一的时间给外厂加工，并试制、生产机器设备来支援工农业生产大跃进，并在两年内自己更新机器设备，腾出原有的设备支援农村兴办一所机器修理厂。
    现在这个厂的修理部已经承揽了不少外厂的加工任务。他们正在为天津郊区民族农业社赶制一百多件水车、水泵零件，为天津印染厂等四个单位制造十台胶体研磨机，还调出六个保全工人支援兄弟工厂。
    这个工厂的修理部共有十台老旧机床，二十七个职工，担负着日产二十五万公尺的染布机和二百台织布机的修理任务。过去因为生产潜力挖得不够，往往把一些修理活委托外厂加工。在“双反”运动中，职工们提出：保证在承担全厂的修机任务外，还要挤出时间为外厂加工。改进工具，改进操作的事例不断出现，例如厂内织布间大修理，需要加工一万个螺丝，要生产三个半月才能完成。车工姚国良改进了工具，使生产效率提高了四倍半。过去做织布机的零件轴子芯，是用人工拿钢锉锉，现在改用车床铣，效率提高了近六倍。　（舒倜）
