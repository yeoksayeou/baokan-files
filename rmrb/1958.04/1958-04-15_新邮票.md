    New Stamps
    Chinese Paleontology Stamps, issued April 15, 1958.
    In scientific research, the Earth's history is divided into five eras: Archean, Proterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. Various higher life forms only appeared successively starting from the Paleozoic era. Based on the above divisions, the stamps feature fossils from the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras, to illustrate the achievements of scientific research in China's socialist construction.
    The Huali Mountain Trilobite is named after its initial discovery in Huali Mountain near Tai'an, Shandong. It is generally only one to two inches long and is a Paleozoic marine animal, having lived approximately 500 million years ago. The stamp design features a trilobite fossil, with a reconstruction drawing based on the fossil at the top.
    The Lufeng Dinosaur is the most famous of the various dinosaurs from the Mesozoic era. Its tracks are found all over mainland China. Some large dinosaurs were over 30 meters long and weighed 30 to 40 tons. The dinosaur discovered in Lufeng, Yunnan, in 1938 is a rare complete fossil, making it even more famous. The stamp design features the Lufeng dinosaur fossil, with a reconstruction and depiction of its habitat at the top.
    The Megaloceros pachyosteus is a Cenozoic animal. The complete Megaloceros pachyosteus antler discovered at Zhoukoudian near Beijing is different from those found in other countries, being particularly wide and flattened, not serrated. A large number of broken and partially burned bones have been found at the Zhoukoudian Peking Man site, indicating that these deer not only coexisted with Peking Man in this area 500,000 years ago, but may also have been a major food source for Peking Man. The stamp design features the antler fossil, with a reconstructed image of the Megaloceros pachyosteus at the top. (Attached images)

    新邮票
    中国古生物邮票1958，4，15发行
    科学研究上地球历史划分为太古代、元古代、古生代、中生代、新生代五个时代。从古生代开始各种高级生命才先后出现。根据上述分期，邮票采用古生代、中生代及新生代三个时期的古生物化石为内容，借以说明我国社会主义建设中科学研究的成就。
    蒿里山三叶虫由于最早在山东泰安附近蒿里山发现而得名，它身长一般只有一到二寸左右，是古生代海洋的动物，生存时代距现在约五亿年，邮票图案采用三叶虫化石，上端系根据化石所绘出的复原图。
    禄丰恐龙是中生代时期的各种龙类里的最著名者，我国大陆上到处都有它的踄迹。有些大恐龙身长三十余公尺，体重有三、四十吨。1938年在云南禄丰发现的恐龙是世界上少见的完整化石，所以更为著名。邮票图案采用禄丰恐龙化石，上端配以复原图及生活环境而成。
    肿骨鹿是新生代的动物。北京周口店发现的完整的肿骨鹿角，和其他国家的不同，角特别宽大，并且是扁状形，不是细齿形，在周口店猿人遗址中发现有大量破碎的和一部分燃烧过的骨胳，表明这种鹿类在五十万年前不但和中国猿人同生于这一带，并且可能是中国猿人的一种主要食物。邮票图案采用鹿角化石，上端配肿骨鹿复原图形。（附图片）
