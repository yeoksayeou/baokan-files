Thought Reform Must Be Achieved Through Self-Awareness
Da Ke

    Implementing the mass line in the thought reform movement of intellectuals is a very important matter. Many universities and colleges in Shenyang, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have paid attention to inspiring self-awareness, patiently providing assistance, and have launched a mass-based high tide of ideological revolution of self-reform and self-education. Of course, inspiring mass self-awareness is not easy. In the process of self-reform, the masses generally have ideological concerns. In response to this situation, many universities and colleges have repeatedly explained the policies to intellectuals, discussed the nature of the movement, provided enlightenment, and supported and encouraged the masses' determination for self-reform. They have all put forward inspiring and correct action slogans, with Party members and League members taking the lead in self-criticism, and have adopted various methods. For example, the Party Committee of Tianjin Normal College put forward the slogan: "Confess everything from the bottom of your heart, get rid of all burdens, be relaxed and happy, forge ahead bravely, be conscious and willing, set yourself on fire, make a thorough break and stand anew, strive to be both Red and expert, think about the past, look at the present, release and advance simultaneously, examine and reform simultaneously, Party members and League members take the lead, and finish well." Schools in Shenyang, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places held ideological exhibitions, and organized heart-to-heart talks in freely formed groups of twos and threes. This has played a great role in forming a high tide of mass self-conscious reform. Many people reflect that this time it is not a matter of a few people rectifying a few people, but that everyone is making a great leap forward.

    The exchange of heartfelt thoughts and exposure of problems must rely on mass self-awareness, and analysis and criticism must also rely on mass self-awareness. Many universities and colleges in Tianjin have summarized the problems exposed by the masses into several major issues for debate, to raise awareness and distinguish right from wrong; this is one method. Some schools concentrate on debating issues, without first providing topics, but allowing the masses to propose their own topics for discussion, which has also achieved very good results. For example, Nankai University adopted this method, and the majority of teachers and students are very satisfied because they feel that this is the best way to solve the problems that they need to solve.

    Of course, self-awareness does not equal letting things drift. Appropriate external assistance is necessary. Moreover, strengthening the leadership of the Party plays an even greater role. However, thought reform must be achieved through self-education and self-struggle, and whether or not thought can be reformed depends on each individual's own efforts. Therefore, thought reform must be achieved through self-awareness.

    思想改造必须通过自觉
    大可
    在知识分子思想改造运动中贯彻群众路线，是一件很重要的事情。沈阳、北京、上海、天津等地许多高等学校注意启发自觉，耐心帮助，掀起了群众性的自我改造、自我教育的思想革命高潮。当然，启发群众自觉，这并不是很容易的。在自我改造过程中，群众一般是有思想顾虑的。针对这种情况，许多高等学校对知识分子反复讲政策，谈运动的性质，进行启发，并支持和鼓励群众自我改造的决心。他们都提出了鼓舞人心的正确的行动口号，党团员带头检查，以及采取了多种多样方式。如天津师范学院党委提出了“心底交清，包袱放尽，轻松愉快，奋勇前进，自觉自愿，引火烧身，大破大立，奔向红专，想想过去，看看现在，边放边进，边查边改，党团带头，善始善终”的口号；沈阳、天津、北京等地学校举办了思想展览会，三三两两自由结合的谈心会等。这对形成群众自觉改造的高潮起了很大作用。很多群众反映，这次不是一部分人整一部分人，而是大家都跃进。
    交心和暴露要依靠群众自觉，分析和批判也要依靠群众自觉。天津许多高等学校，把群众暴露的问题归纳成若干重大的问题进行辩论，提高认识，分清是非，这是一种办法。有的学校集中辩论问题，也不先出题目，而让群众自己出题讨论，这也收到很好效果。例如，南开大学就是采取这种办法的，广大师生都很满意，因为他们感到这最能解决他们切身所要解决的问题。
    当然，自觉并不等于自流。适当的外力帮助是必要的。并且，加强党的领导更有重大作用。但是，思想改造必须通过自我教育自我斗争，思想能否改造决定于每个人自己的努力，因此，思想改造必须通过自觉。
