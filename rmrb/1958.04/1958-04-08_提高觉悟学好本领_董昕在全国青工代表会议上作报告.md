Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th. The National Youth Workers' Representative Conference continued today. Dong Xin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "Raise Awareness, Master Skills, Everything for Socialism."

Dong Xin said that young workers are the fresh blood of China's working class. Under the cultivation and education of the Chinese Communist Party, they, together with adult and older workers, have made tremendous contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. From 1953 to 1957, young employees across the country put forward 2.05 million rationalization proposals, of which those that have been implemented have a calculable value of more than 300 million yuan. Since 1953, one million young employees across the country have been elected as advanced producers, advanced workers, and labor models, and 10,000 young employees have organized 1,200 youth shock brigades. In the nationwide rectification campaign, the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the good news of young employees breaking quotas, creating new records, and leaping forward again and again is coming from all corners of the country every moment. All this shows that young employees are an important force that must be relied upon.

Dong Xin said that in order to enable young employees to play a greater role in the future socialist construction, young employees must carry out ideological transformation. After elaborating on the necessity and importance of young employees carrying out ideological transformation, Dong Xin said: In the current socialist education and anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, young employees must quickly and deeply solve the fundamental question of "for whom to work." Only through repeated self-education and serious ideological transformation, resolutely and thoroughly eliminating the selfish and self-interested thoughts of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, can the communist outlook on life of working for socialism and serving the people be firmly established. Young employees must also master skills and constantly improve their cultural and technical levels.

Dong Xin said: The practice of the Great Leap Forward has proven that technological innovation is the basic way to improve social productivity. Only by improving tools, improving operating methods, and adopting new technologies can we greatly improve labor productivity. Technological innovation is the demand of the broad masses of employees in the Great Leap Forward, and it is also the demand of young employees.

Dong Xin also said that young employees must respect veteran workers, humbly learn from the production experience of veteran workers, and especially learn from the political qualities and the virtues of hard work, plain living, thrift, humility, and prudence of veteran workers. Young employees must accept all the advantages of veteran workers in order to shoulder the responsibilities of the leading class together with veteran workers.

    提高觉悟学好本领
    董昕在全国青工代表会议上作报告
    据新华社上海7日电　全国青年工人代表会议今天继续举行。中华全国总工会书记处书记董昕在会上作了题为“提高觉悟、学好本领，一切为了社会主义”的报告。
    董昕说，青年工人是我国工人阶级的新鲜血液，他们在中国共产党的培养教育下，和成年、老年工人在一起，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中作出了巨大的贡献。从1953年到1957年，全国青年职工提出了二百零五万件合理化建议，其中已经实现的可以计算的价值就有三亿元以上，1953年以来全国有一百万青年职工当选为先进生产者、先进工作者和劳动模范，有十万青年职工组织了一万二千个青年突击队。在全民整风、反浪费反保守运动和工农业生产大跃进中，青年职工突破定额、创造新纪录、跃进再跃进的捷报，每时每刻都从全国各个角落传来。这一切都说明青年职工是一支必须依靠的重要力量。
    董昕说，为了使青年职工在今后社会主义建设事业中发挥更大的作用，青年职工必须进行思想改造。董昕在阐述了青年职工进行思想改造的必要性、重要性之后说：在目前正在进行的社会主义教育和反浪费反保守运动中，青年职工必须迅速深刻地解决“为谁劳动”这个根本性的问题。只有继续经过反复的自我教育和严肃认真的思想改造，坚决彻底地肃清资产阶级小资产阶级的自私自利思想，才能把为社会主义劳动为人民服务的共产主义人生观巩固地建立起来。青年职工同时还要学好本领，不断提高文化技术水平。
    董昕说：生产大跃进的实践证明：革新技术是提高社会生产力的基本途径，只有改进工具、改进操作方法，采用新技术，才能大大提高劳动生产率。革新技术是生产大跃进中广大职工的要求，也是青年职工的要求。
    董昕还说，青年职工必须尊重老工人，虚心地学习老工人的生产经验，特别要学习老工人的政治品质和艰苦朴素、勤俭、谦虚谨慎的美德。青年职工必须把老工人身上所有的好处都接受过来，才能和老工人一起担当起领导阶级的责任。
