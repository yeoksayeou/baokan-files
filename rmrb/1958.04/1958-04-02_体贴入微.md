    Considerate and Meticulous

    During the production upsurge, the operating style of many stores has greatly improved. The long queues in front of grain stores have disappeared, replaced by shop assistants helping elderly women deliver grain to their homes. Some cities have seen the emergence of late-night department stores near train stations, bringing great convenience to passing travelers. Employees of the Tianjin commercial department and the Beijing Dongsi Post Office have also created many new service methods with an innovator's attitude. They spare no effort and think of customers in every way. This is not just a simple improvement in business, but the establishment of a new atmosphere in the socialist service industry. We welcome this good style and hope that other departments will consider doing the same. For example, we have heard that in some fraternal countries, cloakrooms in public places such as theaters and cinemas can help people who check their clothes sew on buttons; telephone bureaus can, at the request of users, wake up travelers taking a late-night train, or tell football fans the results of the game, and so on. We can also try these good experiences. As long as everyone is determined, they will surely come up with more good ideas.

    在生产高潮中，许多商店的经营作风有了大改进。粮食店门前的长蛇阵不见了，代之而来的是营业员帮助老大娘送粮上门；有的城市车站附近出现了夜间百货商店，给过路旅客带来很大便利。天津商业部门和北京东四邮局的职工，也以革新者的姿态，创造了许多新的服务方法。他们不辞辛劳，处处为顾客着想，这不仅仅是简单的改进业务的问题，而是树立了社会主义服务行业的新风气。我们欢迎这种好作风，希望其他部门也考虑这样做。例如，听说在有些兄弟国家里，剧院、电影院等公共场所的存衣处，可以帮助存衣的人钉衣扣；电话局可以受用户的委托，叫醒半夜搭车的旅客，或者把球赛的结果告诉球迷等等。这些好经验，我们也可以试行。只要大家有志于此，一定还会想出更多的好办法来。
