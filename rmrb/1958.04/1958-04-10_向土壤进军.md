Editor's Note:

    Improving the soil is another arduous task in marching towards nature. Soil is the foundation for the growth of crops. The quality of the soil has a decisive effect on the growth and harvest of crops. In two pieces of land with different soils, even if the conditions such as fertilizer, seeds, water conservancy, and cultivation are the same, the harvest on fertile land is always several or even dozens of times higher than the yield on barren land. Therefore, while we attach importance to farmland water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, we must pay great attention to soil improvement in order to make water, fertilizer, and all technical measures effective in increasing production.

    However, the great significance of soil improvement is not only reflected in the fact that people can conquer nature and turn low-yield fields into high-yield fields; at the same time, it also includes a revolutionary competition between people. If low-yield fields are transformed into high-yield fields, how can high-yield fields with naturally superior conditions stagnate? Therefore, as long as the yield of low-yield fields is increased, it will promote the increase in production of medium-yield and high-yield fields.

    Soil improvement will have an invaluable effect on promoting a great leap forward in agricultural production!

    向土壤进军
    改良土壤是向大自然进军的又一项艰巨任务。土壤是农作物生长的基础。土壤的好或坏，对农作物的生长和收获有着决定性的作用。在土壤不同的两块地里，即使肥料、种子、水利、耕作等一切条件相同，肥沃土地上的收获量总比瘠薄土地的产量高出几倍或者十几倍。因此，当我们重视农田水利和积肥等工作的时候，必须十分重视改良土壤工作，才能使水、肥以及一切技术措施对增产发生有效的作用。
    但是，改良土壤的伟大意义，还不仅仅表现在人能够战胜自然，使低产田变成高产田；同时，它还包含着人与人之间的革命竞赛。如果低产田经过改造变成高产田，那么占有得天独厚的优越条件的高产田又怎能停滞不前呢？因此，只要把低产田的产量提高了，就能促进中产田和高产田提高生产。
    改良土壤对促进农业生产大跃进将产生难以估价的作用！
