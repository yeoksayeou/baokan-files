    Waves of Progress in the Great Leap Forward

    Support

    At the work area's meeting to compare advanced units, Fan Cheng's youth shock team fell behind Wang Fangcai's group. At the end of the meeting, Fan Cheng hung his head, feeling as uncomfortable as if he had indigestion. He thought: I must work hard and mobilize everyone to surpass them.
    The next day, Wang Fangcai's group accepted the task of pouring concrete for platform number 19. Because several comrades were still on leave and hadn't returned to their posts, the group didn't have enough people to operate one mixer, and it was necessary to temporarily transfer three people from other groups for support. Wang Fangcai found the foreman, and Foreman Zhou considered it for a long time, knowing that they really needed people, but also feeling the difficulty of drawing people. Fan Cheng's youth shock team was considered to have a full complement of personnel, and drawing a few wouldn't be a big problem. However, they had just competed the night before, and Fan Cheng's team had lost. Would they agree to transfer their labor to support the other side today?
    The foreman tentatively spoke with Fan Cheng, soliciting his opinion, asking if he was willing. As if understanding the foreman's intention, Fan Cheng was even more cheerful than before, and his attitude was very firm. He said, "How could we be unwilling! If we can't beat them, we should catch up; we can't deliberately pinch other people's sore feet, can we? We wouldn't do that kind of thing."
    The foreman was truly happy to hear this. He patted Fan Cheng on the shoulder and said, "Old Fan, who do you think is suitable to send?"
    "Don't worry, if we're going to support someone, we'll definitely send good soldiers and strong generals."
    Sure enough, the three young men from Fan Cheng's team, who were highly skilled and physically strong, seemed to be full of energy when they arrived in Wang Fangcai's group. On the first day, they helped them break through the advanced plan target.
      Two Drafts
    In the past, when discussing the guarantee conditions for the group, Master Zhu Jinfang always leaned against the wall, hunched over, smoking a cigarette, and said nothing. If the plan was drawn up more advanced, he would inevitably say a few sarcastic remarks afterwards. But this time in the evening, when the group was drawing up a Great Leap Forward production plan, he exceptionally sat at the brightly lit table, with a serious and conscientious expression on his face. Little Wang took the lead, saying, "We can guarantee to exceed the quota by 40% this year." Before he finished speaking, Master Zhu stood up, his face red, his beard trembling with excitement, and said, "I propose raising it to 80%."
    This sudden voice immediately drowned out the chattering voices of everyone, and the room was filled with a silent and calm atmosphere. Everyone was restless inside, harboring doubts. The captain said, "Master Zhu, you rarely speak up, but today's words are invaluable. Tell us your idea."
    Zhu师傅 was all smiles, he suddenly unfolded the two drafts he had been hiding in his arms for several days in front of everyone. "See if these will work. These are the two tools I want to improve. This is called a scriber, and this is called a punch. If they are successful, it is estimated that they can both improve work efficiency by 20 to 30 percent."
    For these two drafts, Master Zhu had been busy for three nights without sleeping. His wife shed tears and urged him to sleep, but he ignored her after repeated urging. Finally, she provoked him, and he glared at her and asked, "What do you know? Everyone is in the Great Leap Forward now. Can you let me enter socialism with the stinky name of 'backward'? Do you know? These two things will help me take off this 'backward' hat."
    Before he finished speaking, a burst of applause rang out. Everyone said in unison, "Master Zhu, this is truly a Great Leap Forward!" Master Zhu immediately said, "Hey, I'm lagging behind! I have to catch up with you with rocket artillery!"

    跃进中的浪花
    西北第一工程公司七工区　查天琦
    支援
    在工区的比先进会上，范成青年突击队落在王方才小组后面了。散会时，范成头搭拉着，心里像消化不良似的，难受极了。他想：要好好努力，非发动大家比过他们不可。
    第二天，王方才小组接受了十九号平台混凝土的浇灌任务，因为轮休有几个同志还未回到工作岗位上，小组人数不足开一部拌和机，势必从外组临时抽调三个人来支援。王方才找到工长，周工长考虑了半天，知道他们确实要人，但又感到抽人的困难。范成青年突击队算是人马齐全，抽出几个问题不大。可是，他们两个队，恰巧才在昨晚比过的，又是范成队输了，今儿要抽调他们的劳力去支援对方，会同意吗？
    工长找范成试探性的谈了谈，征求他的意见，问他愿意不？范成像是了解到工长的意思似的，情绪比前更加爽朗，态度十分坚决，他说：“这怎能不愿意呢！比不过他们应该赶嘛，还能故意的捏人家疼脚吗？我们是干不出那号事的。”
    工长听到这话，真从心里高兴。他拍着范成的肩说：“老范”你看抽去那几个合适？”
    “放心吧，打算去支援人家，少不了是拿出好兵好将。”
    果然，范成队的三个技术高、体力棒的小伙子，一到了王方才小组里，干起活来好像生龙活虎，第一天就帮助他们突破了跃进计划指标。
      两张草图
    往常讨论小组保证条件时，朱金芳师傅总好背靠着墙，勾着头抽烟，一言不发。计划订得先进些，会后他少不了要说几句风凉话。可是这次晚上，小组订生产跃进计划，他破例坐在灯光明亮的桌子边，脸上显现出严肃认真的神色。小王先打头炮，他说，我们今年可以保证超额40％。他话音未落，朱师傅红着脸儿站起来，激动得胡须抖抖的说：“我提议提高到80％。”
    这突如其来的嗓音，顿时盖住了大家叽叽喳喳的碎语声，屋子里充满了沉默镇静的气氛。个个内心动荡不安，怀有疑虑。队长说：“朱师傅，你是从来难得开金口，今天的话可算得是金不换，就说说你的主意吧。”
    朱师傅喜笑颜开，把藏在怀里好几天的两张草图，忽地抖开在大家眼前。“你们看行不，这是我想改进的两个工具，这叫划线器，这叫打眼器，要成功啦，估计都可提高工效百分之二三十。”
    为了这两张草图，朱师傅整整忙了三夜没睡觉，他老伴流着眼泪催他睡，三催两催都不理，最后还催得他恼火了，瞪着两个眼睛问她：“你懂得什么，现在人人都在大跃进，你能让我进到社会主义还戴个‘落后’臭名吗？你知道?，这两张东西，会帮助我摘掉‘落后’这顶破帽子的。”
    等他话还没有落音，就响起一片掌声。个个都异口同声说：“朱师傅，你这真算得上大跃进啊！”朱师傅马上说：“嘿，落后了！总得坐火箭炮撵上你们呀！”
