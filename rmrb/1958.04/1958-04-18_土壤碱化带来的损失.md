In 1957, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps had a total sown area of more than three million mu. Due to unreasonable irrigation causing soil salinization and alkalization, the cumulative area abandoned over the years has reached about 380,000 mu, and 690,000 mu have experienced reduced production due to salinization damage.

    新疆生产建设兵团1957年总播种面积三百多万亩。由于灌溉不合理造成土壤盐碱化，而历年弃耕的累计面积已达三十八万亩左右，因盐碱害而减产的有六十九万亩。
