Organizing to Generate New Productivity
    Shanxi Factories Collaborate to Successfully Resolve Difficulties in Manufacturing Irrigation and Drainage Machinery

    (Our newspaper, Taiyuan, March 31st) Over fifty state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private factories in Shanxi Province are carrying out production collaboration to overcome difficulties such as insufficient raw materials and technical challenges in the production of irrigation and drainage machinery, in order to meet the needs of farmland irrigation in the spring and summer seasons in a timely manner.

    Shanxi Province originally planned to produce and supply only over 1,600 units of irrigation and drainage machinery in the first half of this year. In the "crossing the Yellow River" and "surpassing the Yangtze River" great leap forward, farmers in various regions have completed and started over 400,000 water conservancy projects, increasing the irrigated area to twice that of the several thousand years before liberation. Various regions are requesting the supply of more irrigation and drainage machinery. Based on this new situation, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee decided to increase production by another 8,750 units to meet agricultural needs. However, to increase production of so many irrigation and drainage machines before the end of June, not only were raw materials insufficient, with a large portion to be resolved locally, but there were also no blueprints. In particular, some small factories could not produce many castings and accessories due to equipment limitations. Therefore, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee and the Provincial Planning Committee recently organized state-owned, locally state-owned, jointly state-private, and handicraft sectors throughout the province to carry out collaborative production to overcome difficulties. At present, larger factories and mines throughout the province have begun to clear warehouses to find various raw materials to meet the needs of irrigation and drainage machinery production. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Yangquan Iron Plant, among others, have also taken many measures to increase the production of silicon steel sheets, steel, and pig iron. Many large and technically difficult to master castings and accessories are being collaboratively produced by units with better technical conditions such as the state-owned Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory and the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory. Recently, some factories that have successfully trial-produced new products have also sent the new products to small factories with weak technical strength as samples.

    组织起来产生新的生产力
    山西各工厂协作生产顺利解决制造排灌机械中的困难问题
    本报太原31日电　山西省五十多个国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂开展生产协作，克服排灌机械生产中的原材料不足和技术等困难，以便适时地满足春夏两季农田水利的需要。
    山西省原计划今年上半年生产和供应的排灌机械只有一千六百多台。各地农民在“过黄河”、“越长江”的大跃进中，完成和已经动工的水利工程即有四十多万个，增加的灌溉面积等于解放前几千年的两倍多，各地要求供应更多的排灌机械。山西省人民委员会根据这个新形势，决定再增产八千七百五十台，以满足农业需要。但是，要在6月底前增产这么多的排灌机械，不仅原材料不足，好大一部分要由当地自己解决，连图纸也没有。特别是一些小工厂，由于设备的限制，不少铸件和配件不能制作。因此，山西省人民委员会和省计划委员会最近组织全省国营、地方国营、公私合营和手工业等部门开展协作生产，克服困难。目前，全省较大厂矿都开始清理仓库，找寻各种原材料，以满足生产排灌机械的需要。太原钢铁厂和阳泉铁厂等，还采取了许多措施，增产矽钢片、钢材和生铁。许多大的和技术上不易掌握的铸件和配件，都由技术条件较好的国营经纬纺织机械厂和太原矿山机器厂等单位协作生产。最近，一些产品已经试制成功的工厂，还把新产品送给技术力量薄弱的小工厂作样品。
