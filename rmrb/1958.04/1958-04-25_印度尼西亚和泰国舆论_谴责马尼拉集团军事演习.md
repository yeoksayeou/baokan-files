Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is conducting a series of military exercises. According to the Thai newspaper "Pictorial News," Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries began a week-long large-scale land and air force military exercise in Bangkok on the 22nd. Military staff officers from eight member countries participated in this exercise. In addition, "observers" from the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the Syngman Rhee clique participated.

It was also announced that twenty-four ships from five countries—the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Pakistan—would gather in Singapore starting April 28 for a two-week naval exercise. The main part of this exercise will be a voyage from Singapore to Malaya from May 5 to 13.

These provocative acts by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have aroused extreme dissatisfaction from Indonesian authorities and public opinion.

Jakarta’s "Indonesian Torch" published an editorial on the 23rd saying that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is taking this action right in front of Indonesia’s eyes to support Indonesian rebels and to intimidate Indonesia in order to prevent the Indonesian government from completely crushing the rebels.

Bangkok's "Pictorial News" pointed out Thailand's serious financial and economic situation and condemned the Thai government for using most of the national budget for military purposes and participating in Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military exercises. "Pictorial News" protested against foreign soldiers coming to Thai territory in peacetime.

    印度尼西亚和泰国舆论
    谴责马尼拉集团军事演习
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：东南亚条约组织正在进行一系列的军事演习。据泰国报纸“图画新闻”报道，东南亚条约组织国家已于22日开始在曼谷举行为期一周的大规模陆空军军事演习。八个成员国的军事参谋参加了这次演习。此外，还有吴庭艳集团、蒋介石集团和李承晚集团的“观察员”参加。
    另据宣布，美国、英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和巴基斯坦五个国家的二十四艘舰只将于4月28日起在新加坡集合举行一次为时两周的海军演习。这次演习的主要部分将从5月5日到13日从新加坡到马来亚的一次航行中举行。
    东南亚条约组织的这些挑衅行为引起了印度尼西亚当局和舆论的极度不满。
    雅加达的“印度尼西亚火炬报”23日发表社论说，东南亚条约组织在印度尼西亚眼面前采取这一行动，是为了支持印度尼西亚叛乱分子，并且对印度尼西亚进行恐吓，以阻止印度尼西亚政府完全粉碎叛乱分子。
    曼谷的“图画新闻”指出泰国严重的财政经济状况，并且谴责泰国政府把大部分国家预算用于军事目的和参加东南亚条约组织军事演习的做法。“图画新闻”抗议外国士兵在和平时期到泰国领土上来。
