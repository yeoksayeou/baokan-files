    On "Black Topics"
    Jin Wen
    During the anti-rightist movement at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the phenomenon of researching "black topics" was exposed as being quite serious. "Black topics" are also constantly being discovered in other research units and in scientific research work at universities.
    Speaking of "black topics," one cannot help but think of "black market tickets," "black markets," "black goods"... a series of black things in pursuit of exorbitant profits. Today's scientific research work is an important part of the socialist construction cause. Today's scientific workers receive great respect from the state and the people. Any work carried out by any scientific worker, whether the contribution to the socialist construction cause is large or small, is valued and supported by the Party and the government, and is given lofty honor. But some people actually want to move such solemn work from the sunlight to the gutter. This cannot but be surprising!
    Why engage in "black topics"? It is to "become famous overnight," it is to gain fame and profit. It is a manifestation of extreme individualism and should be criticized. People who are enthusiastic about "black topics" are indifferent to national plans, and they make it more difficult to complete national plans. The Party and the government call on scientific workers to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level within twelve years, and now there are only ten years left. Every scientific worker should cherish the limited human and material resources, work together with one heart and one mind, and proceed from the overall situation. This is the correct attitude of every scientific worker towards this great call. Whoever makes a contribution in the process of realizing this great call will surely receive the lofty honor bestowed by the state and the people. It is welcomed by the state and the people for scientific workers to covet such socialist fame and seek such socialist benefits. There are not few but many topics that need to be researched with emphasis and in a planned way, and they are urgently awaiting scientific workers to exert their greatest efforts and make contributions.
    Engaging in "black topics," conducting research work secretly in the dark, without the support of leaders or the cooperation of comrades, and doing topics that are unrelated to the problems that the country urgently needs to solve, what results will be obtained? All that will be obtained will be criticism from leaders and comrades, and the waste of human and material resources. Those who do this, even if they do not expose themselves today, will surely be exposed in the future. At that time, it will cause even greater losses to the country and even greater regrets to individuals. It is time to stop engaging in "black topics."
    Of course, the situations of engaging in "black topics" are not all the same. Some "black topics" are omitted from the research plan, and some are new problems discovered during the research process. These should all be discussed and added to the research plan. These "black topics" all need to be checked and handled in a timely and realistic manner.

    谈“黑题目”
    金文
    中国农业科学院双反运动中，揭露出研究“黑题目”的现象相当严重。在其他研究单位以及在高等学校的科学研究工作中也不断发现“黑题目”。
    谈到“黑题目”，不能不使人联想起“黑票”、“黑市”、“黑货”……一系列追求暴利的黑东西。今天的科学研究工作是社会主义建设事业的重要组成部分，今天的科学工作者受到国家和人民群众极大的尊敬，任何科学工作者所进行的任何工作，对社会主义建设事业的贡献或大或小，都得到党和政府的重视和支持，都给予崇高的荣誉。可是竟然有人要把这样庄严的工作从阳光下挪到阴沟里去进行。这不能不令人惊异！
    为什么要搞“黑题目”？是想“一鸣惊人”，是想得名得利。它是极端个人主义的一种表现，应该批判。热心于搞“黑题目”的人，对国家计划是冷淡的，他使国家计划的完成增加了困难。党和政府号召科学工作者们在十二年内赶上世界科学先进水平，现在只有十年时间了，每一个科学工作者都应该珍惜有限的人力物力，同心协力、一切从整体出发。这是每一个科学工作者对待这个伟大号召的正确态度。谁要在实现这次伟大号召的进程中作出了贡献，他必将得到国家和人民给予的崇高荣誉。科学工作者们贪这样的社会主义之名、求这样的社会主义之利，是国家和人民所欢迎的。现在需要重点地有计划地进行研究的题目不是很少而是很多，正急待科学工作者去发挥最大的力量，去立功。
    搞“黑题目”，在黑暗中偷偷摸摸地进行研究工作，既无领导的支持，又无同志们的合作，所做的题目又和国家当前急需解决的问题无关，会得到什么结果呢？得到的只会是领导和同志们的批评和人力物力的浪费。这样作的人，即使今天不自我揭露，将来也必定会被揭露的。那时必将对国家造成更大的损失，对个人是更大的遗憾。是停止搞“黑题目”的时候了。
    当然搞“黑题目”的情况不尽一样。有的“黑题目”是研究计划中漏定的，有的是研究过程中发现的新问题，这些都应当经过讨论，补入研究计划。这些“黑题目”，都有必要进行一个检查，及时地实事求是地加以处理。
