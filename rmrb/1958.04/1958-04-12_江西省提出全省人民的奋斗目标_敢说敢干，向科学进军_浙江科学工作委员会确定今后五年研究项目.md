Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 11th - The Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee convened its 42nd administrative meeting on the 9th, specifically discussing how scientific research and technological reform work should adapt to the urgent needs of the great leap forward in production and construction.

The meeting considered that since liberation, Jiangxi Province's scientific undertakings, due to the leadership and emphasis of the Party and the government, have made great progress like the rest of the country, and have promoted various productions. However, scientific work has not been carried out sufficiently, and in particular, some scientific workers have relatively serious bourgeois thoughts, and some have right-leaning conservative thoughts. Therefore, in scientific research work, they are divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, and divorced from production. Some departments do not have a sufficient understanding of the relationship between scientific research work and the great leap forward in production, have not paid enough attention to it, and have not put scientific research work on an important agenda. The meeting emphasized breaking conservatism, overcoming bourgeois scientific research views, and quickly launching a nationwide march toward science and a technological revolution.

Shao Shiping, Governor of Jiangxi Province, spoke at the meeting on the issue of the great leap forward in culture, science, and education. He called on the people of the province to march towards science. He said that as long as workers and peasants have certain practical experience in production, have scientific research capabilities, and are interested in science, they can participate in scientific research work, and will also be able to become experts in the future. Science is the summary of labor practice. We must break the fallacy that only university graduates can become experts, and mobilize the broad masses to launch a high tide of marching towards socialist science and technological revolution.

Then, Shao Shiping put forward three requirements on how scientific work should make a great leap forward:

One, prepare for the Jiangxi Provincial Science and Technology Work Conference to be held in July. This conference will formulate the 1958 Jiangxi Provincial Scientific Research Plan and the Five-Year Perspective Plan, and exchange experiences in technological reform. He hopes that light industry, heavy industry, agriculture, water conservancy, philosophy and social sciences, culture and education, and other departments will put forward their opinions at the meeting, show their abilities, and display their skills at the meeting.

Two, do a good job in organizational work and organize scientific forces well. First, organize scientific professional groups by system in each unit, and organize both natural sciences and social sciences to integrate science with production and with work; second, organize research groups according to specific issues or projects to study issues related to the department; third, popular science and science associations should give full play to their active role in serving socialist construction. Shao Shiping especially mentioned the issue of manufacturing tractors. He said that farmers welcome the "Wan Neng" (All-Purpose) brand tractor. We must strive for the upstream, we must seize it and do it. Before July, it is best to strive to bring it out in May. All departments must strive for the upstream, first organize a team, and then talk about rectification. Only with a team can we talk about rectification.

Three, in order to welcome the cultural revolution and the technological revolution, we must submit plans as soon as possible and prepare for the establishment of a branch of the Academy of Sciences (first establish a preparatory office). In addition to the existing universities, we must also establish an Institute of Technology, a Socialist Academy, and new universities. Some people have raised two questions about running these schools: money and people. Money is needed, but it doesn't necessarily have to be that much. Spending a little money can do work-study programs. The most important thing is to do it more, faster, better, and more economically. Regarding the issue of people, some people emphasize that without teachers, it cannot be done. We must tap potential from all aspects. There are still many people who can be teachers. For example, many responsible comrades can go to universities to be teachers and students. If they don't know, they can learn. If they learn, they can teach.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 10th - The Zhejiang Provincial Science Work Committee held its inaugural meeting from April 5th to 6th.

More than 500 scientists, professors, engineers, and science and technology workers at the meeting seriously discussed more than 300 important scientific research projects that more than 30,000 science and technology workers in the province will solve in the next five years under the principle of serving production.

These scientific research projects include 262 projects in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, aquaculture, industry, etc., which are practical problems raised by various production departments. Agricultural research projects focus on rice, focusing on the study of continuous cropping rice and other technical measures, and also combining the research of silkworm, mulberry, cattle, and sheep breeding techniques. In forestry, the focus is on the study of oil tea, greening and other technical measures. In industry, the focus is on studying the comprehensive utilization of Zhejiang Province's resources, and vigorously carrying out research on chemical fertilizers and other work.

    江西省提出全省人民的奋斗目标
    敢说敢干，向科学进军
    浙江科学工作委员会确定今后五年研究项目
    新华社南昌11日电　江西省人民委员会9日召开第四十二次行政会议，专门讨论了科学研究工作和技术改革工作怎样适应生产建设大跃进的迫切需要的问题。
    会议认为：解放几年来，江西省科学事业由于党和政府的领导和重视，同全国一样有了很大发展，对各项生产起了促进作用。但是科学工作开展得还很不够，特别是部分科学工作者存有比较严重的资产阶级思想，部分人还有右倾保守思想，因此在科学研究工作上脱离群众，脱离实际和脱离生产。有些部门对科学研究工作与生产大跃进的关系认识不足，还没有引起足够的重视，没有把科学研究工作提到重要日程上来。会议强调打破保守，克服资产阶级的科学研究观点，迅速掀起一个全民性的向科学大进军和技术大革命。
    江西省省长邵式平在会上就文化、科学、教育大跃进的问题讲了话，他号召全省人民向科学大进军。他说，工农群众只要有一定的生产实践经验，有科学研究能力，并对科学有兴趣的，都可以参加科学研究工作，将来同样也能成为专家。科学就是劳动实践的总结，要打破非要大学毕业的人才能当专家的谬论，要动员广大群众掀起一个向社会主义的科学大进军和技术革命的高潮。
    接着，邵式平就科学工作怎样大跃进的问题提出了三点要求：
    一、作好7月份召开江西全省科学技术工作会议的准备工作。这次会议将制定1958年江西省科学研究计划和五年远景规划，交流技术改革的经验。他希望轻工业、重工业、农业、水利、哲学社会科学、文教等部门，都在会上提出自己的意见，拿出东西，在会议上显示一下本领。
    二、做好组织工作，把科学力量很好地组织起来。一是按系统，各单位组织科学专业小组，把自然科学和社会科学都组织起来，做到科学与生产、与工作相结合；二是按专门问题或项目，组织研究小组，研究与本部门有关的问题。三是科普、科联应充分发挥为社会主义建设服务的积极作用。邵式平特别提到制造拖拉机的问题。他说，“万能”牌拖拉机农民很欢迎。我们要力争上游，要抓紧搞，在7月前，最好争取在5月份拿出来。各部门都要力争上游，先组织队伍，再谈整顿，有队伍才能谈上整顿。
    三、为了迎接文化革命和技术革命，要尽速提出方案，筹备成立科学分院（先建立筹备处）。除了现有的高等学校外，还要成立工学院、社会主义学院和新的大学。办这些学校，有人提出两个问题：要钱，要人。钱是要的，但不一定要那么多，花一点钱，可以搞半工半读，最主要的是多、快、好、省。人的问题，有人强调教员少办不成。要从各方面挖潜力，还有很多人可以作教员，比如许多负责同志就可以到大学里去当教师，又当学生，不会就学，学了就教。
    据新华社杭州10日电　浙江省科学工作委员会在4月5日至6日举行成立大会。
    五百多个科学家、教授、工程师和科学技术工作者在会上认真地讨论了今后五年内，全省三万多科学技术工作者在为生产服务的方针下所要解决的三百多个重要的科学研究项目。
    这些科学研究项目中有包括农业、林业、水利、水产、工业等二百六十二个项目，是各生产部门提出来的实际问题。农业研究项目方面以水稻为重点，着重研究连作稻等技术措施，同时也结合进行蚕桑、牛、羊饲养技术的研究。林业方面，重点放在研究油茶、绿化等技术措施上。工业方面以研究浙江省资源的综合利用为中心，并大力进行化学肥料等研究工作。
