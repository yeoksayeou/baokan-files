Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 11th. The Presidium of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, after discussing the letter from Soviet Minister Council Chairman Khrushchev to Prime Minister Grotewohl regarding the cessation of nuclear weapon tests, issued a statement on the 11th, welcoming the Soviet decision to cease nuclear testing within the Soviet Union starting from March 31st of this year.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet resolution is of particularly great significance for the two German states and the entire German people, as it creates favorable conditions for the German people to prevent West Germany from engaging in a nuclear arms race. The government of the German Democratic Republic pledges its full support for the great Soviet initiative.

The Presidium of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic also sent a note to the West German government, proposing that the two German governments jointly respond to Khrushchev's letter to Grotewohl and Adenauer regarding the decision to cease nuclear testing. The note also suggested that the two German states conduct negotiations to draft this joint reply. If the Bonn government does not agree to a joint reply, then an understanding should be reached through negotiations on the common principles upon which the two German governments' replies will be based.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 10th. Kriegel-Valrimont, on behalf of the French Communist Party's parliamentary group, sent a letter to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, requesting that a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee be convened to discuss the attitude France should adopt towards the Soviet Union's cessation of nuclear testing.

The letter pointed out that the Soviet Union has unilaterally ceased conducting nuclear weapon tests. Therefore, a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee should be held as soon as possible to hear the government clarify the position it intends to adopt on the issue of ceasing nuclear testing, and to express its own attitude towards the Soviet Union's proposal to immediately cease such tests.

Kriegel-Valrimont also requested that a discussion on this issue be held in the National Assembly after the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting.
