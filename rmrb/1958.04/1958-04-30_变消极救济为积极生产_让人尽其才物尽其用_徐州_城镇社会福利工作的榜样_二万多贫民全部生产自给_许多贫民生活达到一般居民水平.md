Turning passive relief into active production, making the best use of people's talents and material resources
Xuzhou—a model for urban social welfare work
More than 20,000 poor people are all self-sufficient in production, and the lives of many poor people have reached the level of ordinary residents

(Our report) Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, which still had more than 28,000 poor people relying on government relief in 1955, will no longer need national relief funds from April this year. Recently, the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province held an on-site meeting on urban social welfare production work in this city to promote their advanced experience.

The meeting adopted the method of watching and talking at the same time, listening to the work situation and experience introduction of the civil affairs department of Xuzhou City, and visiting some social welfare production units and resident committees, so that the representatives attending the meeting further clarified the direction of urban social welfare production work and learned specific practices.

In the past few years, civil affairs departments at all levels in Jiangsu Province have organized some social welfare production work, but some people still do not have a sufficient understanding of the policy of "self-salvation through production, mutual assistance among the masses, supplemented by government relief." They one-sidedly believe that urban social welfare work is mainly about relief and that it is difficult to engage in production. The facts in Xuzhou City powerfully criticized this view. The city began to organize poor people and families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers to participate in production in 1952. Now, there are 301 social welfare production units, with nearly 20,000 people participating in production, and relief recipients have basically all participated in production. In 1956 and 1957, the wages issued by these production units were more than 11 times the relief payments in the same period. Many relief households who could not even afford to eat without relief in the past are now living on their own labor income. In 1955, there were more than 28,000 poor people receiving subsidies and relief in the city. By March of this year, only more than 2,000 people remained. From April, all will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in production and will no longer need a penny from the state. (For individual widowed, orphaned, and childless people who have completely lost their ability to work, the production team will provide mutual assistance based on the principle of voluntariness.) The lives of many relief households have reached the living standards of ordinary residents in the area. Seeing these facts in Xuzhou City, the representatives attending the meeting deeply realized that municipal and town civil affairs work must focus on social welfare production work, vigorously organize families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and poor people in cities and towns to participate in production, in order to help them fundamentally get rid of poverty; at the same time, it can drive other civil affairs work.

While discussing the policy, some people believed that Xuzhou has good conditions, such as developed transportation, many mountains... so it is easy to engage in social welfare production. Through visits, introductions of experience, and discussions, the representatives suddenly realized that Xuzhou not only does not have any superior conditions, but also used to be a battleground for military strategists, and the people's lives were extremely poor, with a reputation of "poor mountains and bad waters." However, they have great determination, sufficient energy, a strong determination to overcome difficulties, and a pragmatic work style that proceeds from reality, taking into account people, local conditions, and time. Civil affairs cadres in the city traveled all over thirteen provinces to solve the problem of raw materials. Many grassroots cadres traveled day and night, braving wind and rain to find production opportunities in other places. They do whatever they can find and whoever can do what. If there are mountains, they open mountains to quarry stones; if there are wasteland, they try to improve it into orchards; if there is garbage, they look for treasures from it. They extracted copper and iron blocks from the "garbage" swept up from the ground in hardware factories and steel factories; they turned chicken coops that were so broken that they were used as firewood in chicken and duck shops into four kinds of things: matchboxes, popsicle sticks, papermaking raw materials, and small bamboo stools. For gloves used by workers in factories that are dirty and torn, they extract the oil from them, then wash, bleach, and pull out the thread to weave recycled gloves. In terms of manpower, the vast majority of production objects are old, weak, orphaned, young, and even disabled. However, the elderly are "old but not declining," and the disabled are "disabled but not useless." They all participate in production work within their capabilities based on their own conditions and strength. In this way, they truly make the best use of people's talents and material resources. These facts broke the "conditions theory" of some representatives. They realized that their own right-leaning conservative ideas were at work.

When some people talked about specific practices, they always thought that "it is easy to do things with money, but difficult to do things without money"; some people believed that "spending less money and accommodating more people is a secret." Therefore, they are greedy for big things when organizing production, and want to reach the sky in one step. Some people even brought money-demanding budgets. However, they personally saw how Xuzhou City implemented the policy of "running factories poorly" and how it carried out social welfare production work based on the principles of "less investment, more people, quick results, easy-to-learn rough work, and mass self-management and government support." Without funds, they mobilized the masses to raise or borrow funds. Without houses, they borrowed the houses of cadres or produced in the offices of the resident committee, or even in the open air. Only after production slowly developed did the government provide necessary assistance. Doing so requires less money, more work, and solves more problems. Yunlong District in this city newly organized 30 production teams this year, absorbing 300 to 400 people, without asking the government for a penny of investment. The mat factory in this district had only seven people and eleven yuan of funds when it was established on July 1, 1957; in just over a year, it has developed to more than 200 people, accumulated more than 35,000 yuan in funds, and the total output value in 1957 reached 110,000 yuan, and built 33 factory buildings and 560 square meters of mat sheds by itself. These facts gave the representatives a deep feeling. The people who originally wanted money consciously criticized their extravagant thoughts and "young master" style, no longer wanted money, and expressed their intention to catch up with Xuzhou, compare with Xuzhou, and mobilize the masses to "run factories poorly."

After having an understanding of the policies and specific practices of social welfare production work, the representatives then studied a question: "Should social welfare production work focus on large-scale or small-scale projects?" The experience of Xuzhou City solved this problem for everyone. The larger factories in this city are generally developed from small production teams. At first, they were led by the street office or resident committee. When they reached a certain scale, they were led by the city and district. In this way, the city and district have a number of large production units as the backbone, and the streets have more small production units to develop production. Therefore, civil affairs departments must organize production in a way that "combines bone and flesh, connects large and small, supports the weak with the strong, and depends on each other." Only in this way can it be consolidated.

Based on the great leap forward in thinking, the representatives attending the meeting were full of enthusiasm and energy, and believed that there was much that could be done in civil affairs work. Everyone formulated this year's work plan at the meeting, challenged each other, and put forward the slogan of "A Great Leap Forward in Civil Affairs Work, Full House of Red in Labor Production," and made a proposal to civil affairs workers in provinces and cities across the country to carry out friendly competitions in the Great Leap Forward in Civil Affairs Work.

### 变消极救济为积极生产　让人尽其才物尽其用  徐州——城镇社会福利工作的榜样  二万多贫民全部生产自给　许多贫民生活达到一般居民水平

    变消极救济为积极生产　让人尽其才物尽其用
    徐州——城镇社会福利工作的榜样
    二万多贫民全部生产自给　许多贫民生活达到一般居民水平
    本报讯　在1955年还有二万八千多贫民依靠政府救济为生的江苏省徐州市，从今年4月份起就不要国家发放救济款了。最近，江苏省民政厅在这个市召开了城镇社会福利生产工作现场会议，推广他们的先进经验。
    会议采取边看边谈、看看谈谈、谈谈看看的办法，听取了徐州市民政部门的工作情况和经验介绍，参观、访问了一些社会福利生产单位和居民委员会，使到会代表进一步明确认识了城镇社会福利生产工作的方针，学到了具体的做法。
    江苏省各级民政部门几年来曾组织了一些社会福利生产工作，但是还有一部分人对于“生产自救，群众互助，辅以政府救济”的方针认识不足。他们片面地认为：城镇社会福利工作主要是搞救济，搞生产比较困难。徐州市的事实有力地批判了这种看法。这个市从1952年开始组织贫民、烈军属参加生产，到现在已有社会福利生产单位三百零一个，参加生产的人数近二万人，救济对象已经基本上全部参加了生产。1956年和1957年两年中，这些生产单位发出的工资相当于同期救济费的十一倍多。许多过去一天不救济、一天揭不开锅盖的救济户，现在靠自己的劳动收入生活了。1955年全市有贫民补助和救济户二万八千多人，到今年3月份只剩二千多人，从4月份开始可达到全部生产自给，不再向国家要一个钱了。（对于个别完全丧失了劳动力的鳏寡孤独，由生产小组根据自愿原则，互助解决。）许多救济户的生活达到了当地一般居民的生活水平。到会代表看到徐州市的这些事实，深刻地认识到：市镇民政工作必须以社会福利生产工作为中心，大力组织市、镇烈军属、贫民参加生产，才能帮助他们从根本上摆脱贫困；同时把其他的民政工作带动起来。
    在讨论方针的同时，有人认为徐州条件好，比如交通发达，山多……所以搞社会福利生产容易。通过参观、访问、介绍经验和座谈，代表们恍然大悟，一致认识到：徐州不但没有什么优越条件，而且因为过去是兵家必争之地，人民生活极端贫困，素有“穷山恶水”之称。但是他们决心大，干劲足，有坚强的克服困难的毅力以及因人、因地、因时制宜的从实际出发的工作作风。市民政部门的干部为了解决原料问题，跑遍了十三个省。许多基层干部披星戴月，冒着风雨到外地寻找生产门路。他们找到什么就干什么，谁能干什么就干什么。有山就开山采石，有荒滩就设法改良成果园，有垃圾就从当中找宝贝。他们从五金厂、钢铁厂里地下扫起来的“垃圾”中炼出铜块、铁块；把鸡鸭行里破烂得当柴火烧的鸡筐，变成火柴盒、冰棍棒、造纸原料、小竹凳四种东西。工厂里工人用过的又脏又破的手套，他们把上面的油分提取出来，然后洗净、漂白，拉出线来，织成再生手套。在人力使用上，极大多数生产对象都是老弱孤幼甚至残废者。但是老年人“老而不衰”，残废人“残而不废”。他们都根据本身的条件和力量，参加力能胜任的生产工作。这样，真正做到人尽其力，物尽其用。这些事实打破了部分代表的“条件论”。他们认识到这是自己的右倾保守思想在作怪。
    还有一部分人一谈到具体做法时，总认为“有钱好办事，无钱难办事”；有的认为“花钱少，容人多，是个秘密”。因此，他们在组织生产时贪大，想一步登天，有人还带来了要钱的预算。但是，他们亲眼看到了徐州市如何贯彻“穷办厂”的方针，如何本着“投资少，容人多，收效快，粗工易学以及群众自办、政府扶持”的原则，进行社会福利生产工作。没有资金，就发动群众自筹或者挪借，没有房屋，就借用干部家的房子，或在居民委员会办公的地方生产，甚至就在露天生产。等到生产慢慢发展起来后，政府才给予必要的帮助。这样做，花钱少，办事多，解决问题大。这个市的云龙区，今年新组织了三十个生产小组，吸收了三、四百人，没有要政府投资一文钱。这个区的席薄厂，在1957年7月1日建厂时，只有七个人，十一元资金；仅仅一年多的时间，已发展到二百多人，积累资金三万五千多元，1957年的生产总值达到十一万元，并自己动手建起厂房三十三间，席棚五百六十平方公尺。这些事实使代表们感受很深，原来想要钱的人自觉地批判了阔气思想和“大少爷”作风，不再要钱了，并且表示要赶徐州，比徐州，发动群众“穷办厂”。
    对社会福利生产工作的方针和具体做法有了认识以后，代表们又进而研究了一个问题：“社会福利生产工作究竟以搞大型的为主，还是搞小型的为主”？徐州市的经验为大家解决了这个问题。这个市较大型的工厂一般都是由小型的生产小组发展起来的，起先属街道办事处或居民委员会领导，当具有一定规模以后，才由市、区领导。这样，市、区有若干大型的生产单位作为骨干，街道有更多的小生产单位来发展生产。因此，民政部门组织生产必须“骨肉结合，大小相连，以强扶弱，相互依存”。这样，才能巩固。
    参加会议的代表在思想大跃进的基础上，个个情绪饱满，干劲十足，认为民政工作大有可为。大家在会上订出了今年的工作规划，互相挑应战，并提出“民政工作大跃进，劳动生产满堂红”的行动口号，向全国各省、市民政工作者提出倡议，开展民政工作大跃进的友谊竞赛。（附图片）
