Combining Lectures, Labor, and Visits

Nanjing New-Type Agricultural College Born

Students are Half-Farmers and Half-Students, Completely Self-Sufficient for Learning and Living Expenses

Jiangsu Province’s first privately-run new-type specialized college—Nanjing Municipal Agricultural College—commenced classes on the 10th, with the first lecture on “Soil Science” given by Dai Zhuheng, a lecturer from Nanjing Agricultural College. This is an institution of higher learning established without spending a single penny of state funds.

This school implements the socialist educational policy of combining education with production. Students are half-farmers and half-students, relying on production to be self-sufficient for learning and living expenses, studying professional courses well within three years, and becoming various agricultural technical talents and teachers for agricultural middle schools.

The majority of the students at this school are urban high school graduates who began reclaiming wasteland collectively in Jia Gang Township in the suburbs of the city starting from September of last year, totaling three hundred and five people. They have four hundred mu of wasteland, of which two hundred mu have already been reclaimed. They use dormitories as classrooms, desks and chairs were supported by other schools and carried into the city by students. The school was thus established in a simple and crude manner.

In its first year, Nanjing Municipal Agricultural College plans to offer four to five professional courses such as chemistry, soil science, and agricultural machinery. The teaching content is closely integrated with production, "do what you learn; learn what you do." The teaching method is to combine lectures, labor, and visits. Teachers are university professors, scientists, technically trained cadres with practical work experience, and veteran farmers. The formulation of the teaching plan and the teaching staff have all received assistance from Nanjing Agricultural College. (Xinhua News Agency)

    讲课、劳动、参观三结合
    南京新型农业专科学校诞生
    学生半耕半读，学习和生活费用完全自给
    江苏省第一所民办的新型专科学校——南京市农业专科学校已在10日开学上课，第一堂课由南京农学院讲师戴朱恒讲授“土壤学”。这是一所没有花国家一分钱办起来的高等学校。
    这所学校贯彻了教育与生产相结合的社会主义教育方针。学生半耕半读，学习和生活费用依靠生产自给，在三年内学好专业课程，成为各种农业技术人才和农业中学的师资。
    这个学校的学生绝大部分是从去年9月份起陆续到市郊夹岗乡集体开荒的城市高中毕业生，共有三百零五人。他们有荒地四百亩，已开垦了二百亩。他们利用宿舍做课堂，桌椅是别的学校支援，由同学们进城搬来的。学校就这样因陋就简地办起来了。
    南京市农业专科学校在第一年内计划开设化学、土壤、农业机械等四至五门专业课，教学内容密切结合生产，“做什么，学什么；学什么，做什么”。教学方法是采取讲课、劳动、参观三者结合的做法。教师由大学教师、科学家、有实际工作经验的技术干部和老农担任。教学计划的制订和师资都得到了南京农学院的帮助。　（新华社）
