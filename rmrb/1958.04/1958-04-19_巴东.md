Padang
The Indonesian government army has recovered Padang, which was the rebels' lair. Padang means "plain" in Indonesian. It is located on the west coast of Central Sumatra, facing the Indian Ocean. It is the third largest city in Sumatra, with a population of nearly 200,000. As early as 1614, the Dutch colonialists established the East India Company in Padang, making it one of the earliest colonial strongholds of the imperialists. In 1795, the British colonialists seized this place from the Dutch, and in 1819 it was occupied by the Netherlands again.

Padang is rich in cloves and gambier, with the highest output in Sumatra. Padang is also the export port for coal, crude oil, rubber, tobacco, rice and other materials produced in Central Sumatra. The Ombilin coal mine nearby has very rich reserves and is world-renowned.

Padang is the transportation hub of central Sumatra. Although the railway from here to Bukittinggi is only 98 kilometers long, because Bukittinggi is located on a plateau, the railway has a very steep slope, and it takes several hours to reach. In addition, Padang has highways to Pekanbaru and air routes to Medan and other cities.

Most of the residents of Padang are Minangkabau, who speak Malay. Women control economic power, and the marriage custom is that men come to the woman's home, and all marriage expenses are borne by the woman. (Hou)

    巴东
    印度尼西亚政府军已经收复了巴东，这里是叛乱分子的老巢。巴东在印度尼西亚文中的意思是平原，它位于中苏门答腊西岸，面临印度洋，是苏门答腊的第三大城市，人口近二十万。荷兰殖民者早在1614年就在巴东设立了东印度公司，因此，它是最早的帝国主义者殖民据点之一。1795年，英国殖民者从荷兰人手里抢去了这块地方，1819年又由荷兰占领。
    巴东盛产丁香和甘蜜，产量占苏门答腊第一位。巴东也是中苏门答腊出产的煤、原油、橡胶、烟草、米等物资的出口港。附近的翁别林煤矿储藏量非常丰富，闻名世界。
    巴东是苏门答腊中部和铁路交通中心，从这里去武吉丁宜的铁路虽然只有九十八公里，但由于武吉丁宜地处高原，铁路坡度很大，要走几小时才能到达。此外，巴东有公路通北干巴鲁、有航空线通棉兰和其他城市。
    巴东的居民，大部是米囊加巴族，操马来语，女子掌握经济大权，婚俗是男子到女家来，一切婚费由女方负担。（厚）
