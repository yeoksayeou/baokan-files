    The Night of the First Spring Thunder
    Han Zi
    The title is quite resounding, but what I want to describe isn't anything earth-shattering. I just want to record, as truthfully as possible, that it was the night of the first thunderstorm this spring, and we were in the pitch-black fields when the thunder struck.
    There was a burst of rain at noon today. The land we needed to harrow was six or seven *li* away. We didn't know how it was raining over there. The captain and the driver (my mentor) were both hesitant: worried about the dampness, worried that it would keep raining. It's been drizzling like this lately, and if we let it dictate our actions, we'd never be able to make a decisive decision. It’s better to confront it with a "Great Leap Forward" spirit than to just wait. So, after less than two minutes of consideration, everyone, including me, blurted out a single word: Go! Refuel immediately, start the engine immediately! Go forward in "third gear" with the accelerator pressed!
    Should I explain that I was driving the tractor? I had three hours of experience on this tractor (D4). With my mentor sitting next to me, I should be able to drive to the "construction site." From 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, my mentor and I took turns harrowing the land, each for about an hour. I harrowed fifteen *mu* of the thirty-six *mu* total. In the beginning, I missed harrowing about five inches to a foot wide at the turning points at both ends. This was because I was flustered and stepped too hard on the foot brake that helps with turning. The more I forced it, the less it obeyed. Sometimes, I also couldn't decide exactly where to start preparing for a large turn. Either I was too early or too late, and either way could cause confusion in driving during the turn. Moreover, in areas with large undulations, I couldn't properly control the accelerator, making the tractor bumpy or unable to move. I couldn't even manage the operating lever while crossing ditches. The rows harrowed by my mentor were originally very straight, but as I drove, they became crooked. While my mentor drove, I quietly observed for an hour. He was focused and calm. In my eyes, he was more agile than the machine. The operating lever, clutch, and throttle handle were in his hands like he was manipulating beads on an abacus, advancing and retreating freely and perfectly. When he was speeding forward on flat ground, his eyes were like swords, and the tractor followed wherever he looked. When I performed the task the second time, I gradually understood the key to his operation. I didn't miss any land, the turns were qualified, the curves were fewer, and everything went smoothly. In the beginning, my mentor needed to give detailed instructions where I made mistakes. After harrowing two rows, he didn't need to say anything anymore. Later, after my big turns, he even said "Perfect" several times. I won’t hide that I was very happy, because this was, in a way, my own little "Great Leap Forward." If the sky wasn't so dark and pregnant with a thunderstorm, and if the tractor wasn't still in the experimental stage, we really wanted to harrow all night. At 7:30 PM, we had to go back.
    We had probably driven half a *li* when two beams of white light fell on the green wheat field. The engine roared, and the dark and silent earth seemed to come alive. I was thinking about which fairy tale film I had seen this scene in. But my mentor listened carefully and suddenly braked. He said that there was a "putulu" sound in the exhaust pipe, possibly something wrong with the cylinder. We had to squat down in the darkness. Little Yang, who was with the vehicle, was sent to call the captain. He was originally supposed to take me home with him, but I wanted to stay with my anxious mentor. He muttered to himself about the location of the problem, hoping to get a definite answer, but I couldn't say anything. A sudden rainstorm forced us to quickly cover the tractor with tarpaulin. The vehicle became like a small house. Suddenly, two people squeezed in. It turned out that they were coming to take over the shift. My mentor discussed the sound the tractor was making with them. What a mysterious sense of hearing they possessed! They could distinguish the normal and abnormal sounds of each part of the machine while driving, which were different during the day and at night. At night, it was quiet, and the sounds were much more complex. To me, it was as if I had the ears of a deaf person. Later, they took off the cylinder head to check. I could only help by holding the flashlight and keeping the screws safe. I couldn't interject a single word while they were investigating. The letdown from when I felt I had made a "Great Leap Forward" to discovering that I was fundamentally unqualified to be a driver was a complete reversal. I was silent and annoyed by the wind and rain, almost feeling a sense of anticlimax. The sudden lightning and the first spring thunder that followed shook me greatly, as if they were the sound coming from my heart.
    After their investigation, they thought that the tractor could still be driven. The engine started again, but after driving a short distance, there was still a "putulu" sound, and we stopped again. My mentor and I went back to the team to report the situation. We walked on the muddy road, reluctant to use the flashlight, and talked about various night march stories. My mentor didn't think that spending the night in the vehicle would be a difficult thing. In the distance, lightning flashed rapidly, spring thunder rolled in, and raindrops hit our bodies. We faced the wind and waves and regained our high-spirited fighting mood. I suddenly realized that I was still very fragile. In this learning process, I either felt complacent about my achievements or discouraged by discovering my incompetence and shortcomings, only seeing the extremes. In fact, achievements are still achievements, and shortcomings are inevitable. Seeing both sides of things and their development, and taking care of myself, is the right thing to do. How precious those simple words, "Learn a little logic," felt to me at this moment.
    We met the captain halfway, and he rushed to the tractor. Around nine o'clock, I looked back and saw that the tractor lights were brighter than lightning. Now, I could vaguely hear what the normal sound of the tractor driving was. The tractor was advancing in the storm.

    第一个春雷之夜
    菡子
    这个题目是很响亮的，其实我所要记述的并不是轰轰烈烈的事情，只是如实地标明我所记的确是今年春天第一次打雷的晚上，打雷时候我们正在漆黑的田野里。
    今天中午有过一阵急雨，我们要耙的地还在六七里路以外，不知那儿下得怎样。队长和驾驶员（我的师傅）都有些犹豫起来了：怕潮，怕还要下。这一阵都是这样淅淅沥沥的，如果听它的摆布，就别想干脆地决定什么，要是拿个“跃进”去对付它，总比等待强。所以考虑不到两分钟，连我在内都迸出一个字：去！马上加油，马上开车！用“三速”、加大油门前进。
    要不要说明一下，车子是我开的。我在这部车上（D4）有过三小时的工龄，师傅就坐在旁边，我是应该可以开到“工地”的。从下午三时到七时，我和师傅轮流耙地，每次个把钟头。三十六亩地中也有我耙的十五亩。开始两圈两头转弯的地方我漏耙过五寸至一尺宽模样，这都是由于我的慌张，把协助转弯的脚刹车踩得太死，愈是强制，愈不听使唤；有时也拿不定主意究竟该在哪儿就作大转弯的准备，不是早了就是迟了，一早一迟都可能在转弯时产生驾驶上的混乱；而且在起伏波度大的地方我也不能恰当地控制油门，弄得颠车或是开不动的样子，更顾不上在跨沟时又同时去掌握操作杆了；师傅开的墒子本来很直，但我开着开着就弯弯扭扭的。在师傅开时我静观了一小时，他精力集中神志泰然，在我看来他比机器灵活，操作杆、离合器、油门的把柄在他的手里，像拨弄算盘珠子似的，进退自如恰到好处；当他在平坦的地方急驶前进时，他目光如剑，射到哪儿车子也跟到哪儿。当我第二次执行任务时，我逐渐也能领会他的操作要诀，没有漏耙过地，转弯合格，曲线也少了，一切顺顺当当的。开始在我犯错误的地方还需要师傅详细指点，耙了两圈，他已用不着说什么，后来还在我大转弯以后，说了几声“正好。”毫不掩饰地说，我是很高兴的，因为这多少也是我的一点“跃进”。要不是天正黑洞洞地孕育着一场雷雨；而车子还在试验阶段，我们真想耙个通宵。在七时半我们只得往回走了。
    大概开出半里路了吧，两道白光泻在绿草如茵的麦地上，机车轰隆隆地开过，漆黑而沉静的大地也显得生动起来，我正在想在哪一个童话片中看到过这样的场面，可是师傅侧耳细听，突然刹了车，他说排气管中有扑噜扑噜的声音，可能气缸部分出了毛病，我们只得在黑暗里蹲了下来。派了随车的小杨去请队长，本来也叫我跟着回家的，但我想陪着满心焦急的师傅。他自言自语地数落着毛病的所在，希望得到确切的回答，我却什么也说不出来。一阵急雨，我们忙着替车子盖油布，车身就变成小屋似的了，突然钻进两个人来，原来是准备来换班的，师傅和他们研究行车发出的声音。这是多么玄妙的听觉，他们可以分辨机子每一部分在行车时正常和非正常的声音，白天和晚上又不一样，晚上静，声音也复杂得多，对于这些我好像长着两只聋子的耳朵。后来他们把缸盖拆下来检查，我也只有帮着打电筒和代为保管螺丝的份儿，在他们研究时一句也插不上嘴。从我觉得自己有了“跃进”到现在发觉自己根本没有资格做驾驶员的泄气劲是一个大转弯。我沉默着，并为风雨所恼，简直有点乐极生悲的样子，那突然射过的闪电和跟着响起的第一个春雷也使我十分震动，仿佛正是我现在心中发出的声音。
    他们研究以后认为还可以开车，马达又响起来了，不过走不多远，仍有扑噜声，又刹住。我和师傅回队报告情况。我们在泥泞的道路上走着，舍不得使用手电，摸黑谈着各种夜行军的故事，师傅没想着如果要在车上过夜也不是什么难堪的事了。远处闪电作急速射，春雷滚滚而至，雨点打在身上，我们迎风破浪，又恢复了亢奋的战斗情绪。我忽然意识到自己还是很脆弱的，在这次学习中，不是为成绩沾沾自喜，就是为发现自己的无能和缺点而灰心丧气，只看极端。其实成绩还是成绩，缺点也不可免，看到事物的两面和它的发展，自己好自为之，才是正理。“学一点逻辑”这几个朴素的字，这时对我有多么亲切。
    半路遇见队长，他赶到车子那儿去了。九时光景，我回头一看，车灯比闪电还亮，现在我隐约地可以听出什么是行车正常的声音了，车子正在暴风雨中前进。
