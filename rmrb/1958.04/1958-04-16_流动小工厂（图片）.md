    Mobile Small Factory

    The local state-owned and jointly state-private agricultural machinery factories under the First Industrial Bureau of Shenyang City organized a mechanized service team. This team has two large trucks, one of which is a "small factory" equipped with machine tools, repair tools, and other machinery installed on the vehicle, and the other is loaded with various processing machines. In the past ten days or so, this service team has inspected and repaired 54 pieces of farm equipment for several agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Shenyang City and milled more than 50,000 catties of rice. They plan to go to seventeen counties and fifty townships to support spring plowing. Xinhua News Agency Reporter Gao Guoquan

    流动小工厂
    沈阳市第一工业局所属地方国营、公私合营六个农业机械厂，组织了一个机械化服务队。这个队有两台大汽车，其中一台是带有安装在车上的机床、修理工具等机械的“小工厂”，另一台是载有各种加工用的机器。近十几天来，这个服务队已为沈阳市郊好几个农业社检修了五十四台农具，磨了五万多斤米。他们计划到十七个县五十个乡去支援春耕。    新华社记者  高国权摄
