Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 31st: The French "National Conference for Peace in Algeria" concluded today. The conference opened yesterday with several thousand Parisian citizens and 1,800 delegates from 72 provinces participating. They represented various political parties.

The conference was initiated by 110 prominent French social and political activists. Among them were writers François Mauriac and Jean-Paul Sartre, renowned political commentators Claude Bourdet, Jean-Marie Domenach, and Maurice Duverger, Leon Feix, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and D'Astier de la Vigerie, Vice-President of the World Peace Council, among others.

Leon Feix spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that war fosters fascism. It is necessary to further make everyone aware of this. He said that in recent months, the momentum of the movement to achieve peace in Algeria has grown stronger and stronger. The bombing of the Tunisian village of Sakiet by French aircraft opened the eyes of many. Feix then looked back at the cessation of the Indochina War, pointing out that it was possible to force the government to achieve peace. He said that negotiations must be made inevitable. Pressure must be exerted on parliamentarians through petitions, demonstrations, strikes, and other means.

André Philip, a former minister who was expelled from the Socialist Party for disagreeing with the party's official policy, listed the failures of France's Algerian policy in his speech. He condemned the government's disregard for the lives and deaths of the people and pointed out the danger of the rise of fascism.

Former Popular Republican Movement parliamentarian Von Lueb—Esberabo also spoke at the meeting. He said that no matter how great our distances may be in other aspects, we are always united on the issue of the continued survival and honor of France.

Brunet de la Marne, representative of the General Confederation of Labor, emphasized the great significance of carrying out struggles in enterprises.

The declaration unanimously adopted by the conference emphasized that force cannot solve the Algerian problem. The only way to solve the Algerian problem is to negotiate with the true representatives of the Algerian people. The declaration emphasized that it is necessary to strive to implement the only policy that can ensure the realization of peace in Algeria.

The conference also adopted a suggestion recommending that national provincial conferences be held to show the will of the residents of the province. The suggestion also called on the French people to use various means to urge the government to stop repressive measures.

    法公众争取阿尔及利亚和平会议
    主张停止战争举行和平谈判
    新华社巴黎3月31日电　法国“争取阿尔及利亚和平全国代表会议”已经在今天闭幕。会议是在昨天开幕的，参加会议的有几千名巴黎市民和来自七十二个省份的一千八百名代表。他们代表各种不同的政治党派。
    这次会议是由法国一百一十个著名社会活动家和政治活动家发起的。他们之中包括作家弗朗索瓦·莫里亚克和让—保罗·萨特，著名政论家克劳德·布尔戴、让·玛丽·多门纳克和莫里斯·杜维歇，法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员莱昂·费克斯，国际民主妇女联合会主席欧仁妮·戈登夫人以及世界和平理事会副主席达斯迪埃—德拉维热里等人。
    莱昂·费克斯在会上讲了话。他指出，战争助长法西斯主义。必须进一步使大家认识这一点。他说，最近几个月以来，争取实现阿尔及利亚和平的运动的声势已经越来越壮大。法国飞机轰炸突尼斯村庄萨基埃特的事件使许多人张开了眼睛。费克斯接着回溯印度支那战争停止的情况，指出有可能迫使政府实现和平。他说，必须促使谈判成为不可避免的。必须通过请愿、示威、罢工等方式来对议员们施行压力。
    因为不同意社会党官方的政策而被开除出党的前部长安德烈·菲利普，在发言中列举了法国的阿尔及利亚政策的失败。他谴责政府不顾人民的死活，并且指出法西斯主义抬头的危险。
    人民共和党前任议员冯吕勃—爱斯贝拉伯也在会上发了言。他说，不管我们在其他方面的距离有多么大，但是在法国的继续生存和荣誉的问题上，我们总是一致的。
    总工会的代表布吕内·德拉马尔着重谈到在企业中进行斗争的重大意义。
    大会在一致通过的宣言中着重指出，武力不能解决阿尔及利亚问题。解决阿尔及利亚问题的唯一办法只能是同阿尔及利亚人民的真正代表谈判。宣言着重指出，必须争取实施唯一能确保实现阿尔及利亚和平的政策。
    大会还通过了一项建议，建议全国各省举行大会，以便表明本省居民的意愿。建议还要求法国人民通过各种方式来促使政府停止镇压措施。
