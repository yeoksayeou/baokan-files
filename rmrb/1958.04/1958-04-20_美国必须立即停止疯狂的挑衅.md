    The United States Must Immediately Stop Its Mad Provocations
    Commentator of this newspaper

    Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko issued a statement on the 18th, protesting the provocative actions of American aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs flying towards the Soviet border. This kind of American provocation is not only a threat to the Soviet Union, but also a serious threat to world peace and human security. Therefore, Gromyko's statement cannot but attract the attention and vigilance of peace-loving people all over the world.

    Everyone knows that the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are making tremendous efforts to ease international tensions. However, this is by no means because socialist countries are afraid of imperialism. Socialist countries have a strong force and confidence to defend peace. The Soviet Union has intercontinental missiles far superior to those of the United States. If the United States dares to take risks, the countries of the socialist camp are not afraid at all, and will certainly give the aggressors a fatal blow. Those who play with fire will be burned. The war maniacs in the United States should be more prudent!

    However, it is worth pointing out seriously that just as the world is eager for talks between the East and West to eliminate the "Cold War" and ease international tensions, the United States has taken such dangerous provocative actions, which is by no means accidental. This is part of the United States' sinister plan to undermine summit meetings and deliberately create tensions. Who doesn't know that the United States is very afraid of the easing of the international situation. It has not only tried its best to delay and sabotage the convening of summit meetings, but also openly refused to take the same action after the Soviet Union decided to unilaterally stop nuclear tests. Not only that, but the United States is also stepping up its nuclear arms race program. The recently concluded meeting of NATO defense ministers is a clear proof of the United States and its partners stepping up their nuclear arms race policy. At this meeting, U.S. General Norstad demanded that member states of this group double their ground forces, and that these forces be equipped with nuclear weapons. More seriously, this American general also demanded that American missile bases be deployed in five or more NATO member states. Obviously, the purpose of the United States is to threaten the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with missile bases densely spread everywhere and forces equipped with nuclear weapons. In fact, these threats can only scare those who are neurasthenic, but they cannot scare the Soviet Union and socialist countries.

    Is it to negotiate or to step up arms preparations? The actions of the United States are very clear. On the one hand, the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France are conducting diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow on preparations for a summit meeting; on the other hand, the U.S. military command has ordered aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs to carry out extremely dangerous provocations against the Soviet Union. How can this make people believe that the United States has the slightest sincerity for negotiations?

    The Soviet government has appealed to other national governments to also protest the provocative actions of the United States, and has requested the United Nations Security Council to discuss the issue of stopping American aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs from flying towards the Soviet border. In order to maintain peace, promote summit meetings, and ease international tensions, the United States must immediately stop this provocative flight and stop the tricks of creating tensions.

    美国必须立即停止疯狂的挑衅
    本报评论员
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯18日发表声明，抗议载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机向苏联边境飞行的挑衅行为。美国的这种挑衅不仅是对苏联的威胁，而且也是对世界和平和人类安全的严重威胁。因此，葛罗米柯的声明不能不引起全世界爱好和平人民的重视和警惕。
    谁都知道，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，都在为缓和国际紧张局势作出巨大的努力。但是，这绝不是社会主义国家害怕帝国主义什么。社会主义国家有着强大的保卫和平的力量和信心，苏联拥有远远比美国为优越的洲际导弹，如果美国敢于冒险，社会主义阵营各国是一点也不怕的，并且一定会给予侵略者以致命的打击。玩火者必自焚，美国的战争狂人们应当放稳重些！
    不过，值得严重指出，正当全世界渴望着东西方举行会谈来消除“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势的时候，美国竟然采取这样危险的挑衅行为，这绝不是偶然的。这是美国破坏最高级会议和故意制造紧张局势的罪恶计划的一部分。谁不知道，美国十分害怕国际局势的缓和。它不但竭力拖延和破坏最高级会议的召开，而且在苏联决定单方面停止核试验之后，公然拒绝采取同样的行动。不仅如此。美国还在加紧推行它的核备战计划。刚刚结束的北大西洋集团国防部长会议就是美国及其伙伴加紧推行核备战政策的一个明证。在这个会议上，美国将军诺斯塔德要求这个集团的成员国把它们的地面部队增加一倍，并且还要以核武器来装备这些部队。更严重的是，这个美国将军还要求在五个或更多的北大西洋集团成员国中布置美国的导弹基地。很明显，美国的目的是要以到处密布的导弹基地以及用核武器装备起来的部队，来威胁苏联和其他社会主义国家。其实，这些威胁，只能吓唬那些神经衰弱的人，却吓不倒苏联和社会主义国家的。
    是进行谈判呢，还是加紧备战呢？美国的做法是很清楚的。一方面美国和英法的大使在莫斯科同苏联外交部进行关于准备最高级会议的外交谈判；另一方面，美国的军事指挥部却命令载有原子弹和氢弹的飞机向苏联进行极端危险的挑衅，这怎能使人相信美国对谈判具有起码的诚意呢？
    苏联政府已吁请其他国家政府对美国的挑衅行为也提出抗议，并且已经请求联合国安全理事会讨论停止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机向苏联边境飞行问题。为了维护和平，并促进最高级会议，缓和国际紧张局势，美国必须立即停止这种挑衅的飞行，停止制造紧张局势的诡计。
