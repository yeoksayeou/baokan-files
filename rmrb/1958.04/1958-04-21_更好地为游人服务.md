Editor's Note: Tiananmen is one of the famous historical sites in the capital. Many people want to take pictures here as a souvenir. In order to meet the needs of the masses, the Cultural Palace Photography Department and the Zhongshan Park Photography Section have opened photography businesses in front of Tiananmen. However, according to readers' letters, their photography quality and service attitude are not satisfactory. Now we are publishing excerpts from two readers' letters, hoping that these two photography departments will improve their service attitude.

	Greatly Disappointed at First Sight
	After I came to Beijing, someone suggested that it would be nice to take a picture in front of Tiananmen. I thought that I don't have many opportunities to come to Beijing, and it is right to spend money to take a picture as a souvenir. So one morning, I came to Tiananmen and asked the Cultural Palace Photography Department to take a picture. Two days later, I went to pick up the photo and was very disappointed. Because the lighting of the photo was not well adjusted, it turned into a white face, and the eyebrows and eyes were unclear, with white spots on the face. The position of the person and the background were not well matched, and the person looked taller than Tiananmen. I raised my opinion to the comrade who took the photo, but he insisted that there was nothing wrong. Later, he even became angry. In the upsurge of comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced in the national service industries, it is very bad for the comrades in the Cultural Palace Photography Department to treat customers with this attitude.

    更好地为游人服务
    编者按：天安门是首都名胜古迹之一。很多人都想在这里照像，留作纪念。为了满足群众要求，文化宫摄影部及中山公园照像部分别在天安门前开办照像业务。但据读者来信反映，他们的照像质量及服务态度还不能使人满意。现在我们摘要发表两篇读者来信，希望这两个照像部改进服务态度。
    一看大失所望
    我来到北京以后，有人向我介绍在天安门前照张像片很好。我想来北京的机会不多，花钱照张像片留作纪念也是应该的。于是在一天上午，我来到天安门前，请文化宫摄影部照了一张像。过了两天，我去取像片，一看很失望。因为照像光线配得不好，照成白脸，并且眉眼不清，脸上有白斑点，人的位置与背景摆得也不相称，照出的人比天安门还高。我向照像的同志提出意见，他硬说没有毛病。后来竟发起脾气来。在全国各服务行业提出比先进、赶先进的跃进高潮中，文化宫摄影部照像的同志还以这种态度对待顾客，这是很不好的。
