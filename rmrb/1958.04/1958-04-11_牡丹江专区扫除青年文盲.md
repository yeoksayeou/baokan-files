    (Our report) The Mudanjiang Special District of Heilongjiang Province has more than 236,500 young people. In recent years, these young people have actively participated in amateur cultural studies, and many have gradually escaped illiteracy. Recently, encouraged by the good news of Ning'an County's illiteracy elimination campaign, and after the mobilization meetings for illiteracy elimination in the province and special district, the youth of the entire district worked hard for another month. By the end of March, the entire district had eliminated illiteracy among more than 206,700 young people, accounting for 87.4% of the total number of young people.
    At present, many townships and communes are actively establishing amateur higher primary and junior secondary cultural classes to strengthen consolidation and improvement work. The entire district has proposed: Continue to work hard for sixty days to ensure that by "June 1st" all young people in the district will be "educated, and no one will be illiterate," realizing the first youth cultural special district.

    牡丹江专区扫除青年文盲
    本报讯　黑龙江省牡丹江专区共有二十三万六千五百多名青年。几年来，这些青年都积极地参加了业余文化学习，有不少青年已逐渐摆脱了文盲状态。最近在宁安县扫除文盲报捷消息的鼓舞下，和在省、专区扫盲动员大会之后，全区青年又苦学了一个月，到3月底，全区已扫除了青年文盲二十万六千七百多名，占青年总数的87.4％。
    目前，许多乡社正积极成立业余高小、初中文化班，加强巩固提高工作。全区提出：再苦战六十天，保证“六一”达到全区青年“人人有文化，个个不文盲”，实现第一个青年文化专区。（郭鸿勋）
