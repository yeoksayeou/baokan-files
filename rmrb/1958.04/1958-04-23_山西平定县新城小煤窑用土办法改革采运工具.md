Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st. The New City Small Coal Mine in Pingding County, Shanxi Province, has used indigenous methods to semi-mechanize the entire production process, changing the backwardness of manual operation.

    Like other small coal mines, the New City Small Coal Mine used to rely entirely on manual coal mining. The mined coal was transported to the surface by manual carrying and lifting. This was not only heavy labor and inefficient, but also frequent personal accidents. During the Great Leap Forward this year, this small coal mine established a cooperative relationship with the nearby iron production cooperative, and together with the iron cooperative, researched and trial-produced machinery for small coal mine production. The iron production cooperative, according to the needs of the small coal mine, successively used molten iron to cast light rails and hand drills, etc. This enabled the small coal mine to replace iron hammers and iron drills with hand drills underground, and laid several light railways from underground to the surface and to the coal storage yard. Coal transport workers pushed small coal carts along the rails to transport raw coal, which was much easier than before. The workers were very happy with their creation and often joked, saying: "Using drills to make holes and blasting underground, and transporting coal with coal cars and railways, it's not much different from a large mine."

    After the small coal mine realized semi-mechanization with indigenous methods, production efficiency greatly improved. Originally, a coal miner could only mine about two tons of coal a day, but now he can mine more than seven tons a day. Coal transport workers have also increased their transportation volume from 7,000 jin per person per day to 30,000 jin.

    Currently, seven or eight small coal mines in Pingding County have adopted this indigenous method to implement semi-mechanization. The small coal mines in Yangquan City have also widely promoted this method.

    山西平定县新城小煤窑用土办法改革采运工具
    新华社太原21日电　山西省平定县新城小煤窑，利用土办法使生产过程全部半机械化，改变了手工操作的落后面貌。
    新城小煤窑和其他小煤窑一样，过去全部用手工采煤。采出的煤运到井上，也是由人工抬、背。不仅劳动繁重、效率低，而且经常发生人身事故。在今年大跃进中，这个小煤窑和附近的铁业生产合作社建立了协作关系，和铁业社一起研究了试做小煤窑生产用的机械。铁业生产合作社根据小煤窑的需要，先后用铁水，浇制出了轻便铁轨和手摇钻等等。使这个小煤窑在井下用手摇钻代替铁锤打铁钎，从井下到井上到储煤场，铺上了数条轻便铁路。运煤工人推着小煤车，顺着铁轨运送原煤，比以前轻快多了。工人们对自己的创造十分高兴，经常打趣地说：井下用钻头打眼放炮，输送煤炭有煤车铁道，不比大矿差多少。
    这个小煤窑用土法实现半机械化后，生产效率大大提高。原来一个采煤工一天只采煤两吨左右，现在一天能采七吨多，运煤工人也由一天一人运七千斤提高到三万斤。
    现在，平定县已有七、八个小煤窑采用这种土办法实行了半机械化。阳泉市的小煤窑也普遍推广了这种办法。
