Readers' words:

    Strengthen the Medical Force of Exploration Teams
    We work year-round in the high mountains and deep valleys. The number of medical personnel in our exploration team is small, and their quality is poor. In the various field teams of our Jiangxi Geological Bureau, there is only one good doctor. The employees reflect, "These doctors can't treat serious illnesses, and they don't want to treat minor illnesses. If you get an acute illness, you're finished." Last November, a family member of our brigade died while on the way to a city hospital due to a serious illness. I suggest that the health department strengthen the medical force in exploration teams.

    加强勘探队的医疗力量
    我们终年在崇山峻岭里工作。我们勘探队的医务人员数量既少质量又差。我们江西地质分局的各个野外队中，好的医生仅有一人。职工们反映：“这些医生大病看不了，小病不想看，闹了急性病可就完蛋。”去年11月，我们大队就曾经有一个家属因患重病，在去城市医院的途中死亡。我建议卫生部门加强勘探队中的医疗力量。
