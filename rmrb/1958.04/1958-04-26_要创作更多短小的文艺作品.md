To create more short and concise works of literature and art

The Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe recently came to Beijing to perform, bringing a batch of newly created programs, all closely coordinated with the current political movements and production struggles. Their content reflects the new life, new ideas, and new customs of the people in the current Great Leap Forward in production, full of socialist spirit. Their forms are diverse, short, and lively, including songs, dances, street plays, one-act plays, and Yue operas. These performances are full of vitality and enthusiasm, and have been valued and welcomed by audiences and literary and art circles in the capital. When songs, dances, and short plays were performed in Tiananmen Square and Qianmen Railway Station Square, they attracted a wider audience of workers, soldiers, students, and residents. An old man praised loudly after watching: "You performed well, thank you!"

Indeed, the literary and art workers in Hangzhou have set an example for the literary and art circles in quickly reflecting real life and enthusiastically serving the current political movement. Like this kind of example, there are many across the country. China's proletarian revolutionary literary and art movement has such excellent traditions. When audiences see the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe performing street plays such as "Do Not Spit Anywhere" and Yue operas such as "The Girl Who Can't Be Locked Up" and "A Thousand Miles a Day," it is easy to think of street plays such as "Put Down Your Whip" and Yangko operas such as "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" during the Anti-Japanese War, which played a positive role in uniting and inspiring the masses in the revolutionary struggle at that time. These works reflect the changes in historical life, are full of the spirit of the times, and will certainly not fail to be handed down to future generations because they are not large-scale, long masterpieces; on the contrary, when we and our descendants recall the struggle life of the people in every revolutionary historical period in the past, people will naturally remember the songs, living newspapers, short plays, and poems that were widely circulated at that time. As long as they sing any one or two lines of the Anti-Japanese War songs and revolutionary songs each time, the great spirit of the heroic people in those revolutionary storms will appear before their eyes, giving them the effect of inspiring fighting spirit. To speak of immortality, isn't such art immortal?

For quite a long time before the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, under the serious influence of bourgeois ideology in literary and art circles, there arose evil winds and wrong tendencies such as opposing so-called "rushing tasks," looking down on short literary and art forms, mocking prolific writers, and being unwilling to perform for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Some singers said that they would not sing songs that were not "improved." When they occasionally sang a mass song, and were welcomed by the audience, the singer would feel sad, sighing that the masses' level was too low and they didn't understand music! Some literary and art workers were full of enthusiasm in the democratic revolution era and created works rich in the atmosphere of the times, but in the socialist revolution era, they hesitated and lacked vigor. Some people even felt depressed, their thoughts were gloomy, and they were incompatible with the socialist spirit. Some people also expressed that they only wanted to write large works and disdained so-called small things. Some rightists and revisionists even blatantly attacked socialist literature and art as "only caring about immediate political propaganda tasks," and ridiculed literature and art serving politics as doing "megaphones of political concepts." They talked extravagantly about the "long-term requirements" of literature and art, fearing that literature and art would not be far enough away from politics! This is so contrary to the truth that Lu Xun said, "Meaningful in the present is meaningful in the future," and the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong!

Due to the victory of the anti-rightist struggle and the in-depth development of the rectification campaign, a great socialist revolution in politics and ideology was carried out throughout the country, and the ideological outlook of literary and art circles has also undergone great changes. The shackles of bourgeois literary and art ideology have been basically shaken off, a brand-new atmosphere has emerged in the literary and art field, a large number of writers and artists have gone to the countryside and mountains, art troupes have gone to rural construction sites to perform, the socialist singing movement in many cities and villages has begun, mass amateur creation is very active, and a large number of folk songs and ballads have been produced in the Great Leap Forward in rural production. It is really a thriving new atmosphere! Professional authors, amateur authors, and actors in Zhejiang Province created dozens of programs in three days after participating in the Zhejiang literary and art circles' oath-taking meeting for the Great Leap Forward in creation, including some fresh and lively works from this performance, which is a good example of the Great Leap Forward in the entire literary and art circles.

The masses need writers and artists to create large-scale, long masterpieces, and they also need them to write a large number of short-form works. Literary and art workers must resolutely throw themselves into the midst of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, live and work with the masses for a long time, "fly the kite on a long string," and accumulate rich raw materials for writing long stories that can summarize the people's struggle life of an era. However, the masses' enthusiasm for production and construction is so great, the development of the situation is so fast, and the masses' demand for culture is so urgent that writers who are enthusiastic about serving the masses cannot write slowly and wait ten or eight years before producing their works. Large works that take a long time to write are undoubtedly needed, and a great era needs great works; however, what is needed more at present is to quickly write various short-form works that can meet the needs of the masses in a timely manner. Small works can also become masterpieces if they are well written. Give the masses songs if they want songs, give them clapper talk if they want clapper talk, give them short plays if they want short plays. Quickly reflecting advanced figures and advanced deeds and serving the current political tasks is the unshirkable responsibility of every literary and art worker. Our literary and art workers should closely combine long-term in-depth contact with the masses and timely reflection of the masses' lives, and should always be revolutionaries in politics and promoters in production.

Six hundred million people are riding the wind and waves in a great leap forward, let the socialist breeze blow up the inspiration of literary and art workers!

### 要创作更多短小的文艺作品

    要创作更多短小的文艺作品
    杭州市越剧团最近来京演出，带来一批新创作的节目，都是密切配合现在的政治运动和生产斗争的。它们的内容反映了当前生产大跃进中人民的新生活、新思想、新风尚，充满了社会主义精神。它们的形式多种多样，短小活泼，有歌曲、舞蹈、街头剧、独幕话剧、越剧等。这些演出生气勃勃，情绪饱满，受到了首都观众和文艺界的重视和欢迎。其中歌曲、舞蹈和短剧在天安门广场和前门车站广场演出的时候，更吸引了工人、战士、学生、居民等广大观众。有一位老人看了之后大声称赞说：“你们演的好，谢谢你们！”
    的确，杭州市文艺工作者在迅速地反映现实生活、热情地为当前政治运动服务上，为文艺界做出了榜样。像这样的榜样，全国各地都有。中国的无产阶级革命文艺运动是有这样的优秀传统的。当观众看到杭州市越剧团演出像街头剧“不要随地吐痰”和越剧“关不住的姑娘”、“一日千里”的时候，很容易联想到抗日战争时期的街头剧“放下你的鞭子”和秧歌剧“兄妹开荒”等，它们在当时的革命斗争中起了团结群众、鼓舞群众的积极作用。这些作品反映了历史生活的变化，充满着时代的精神，决不会由于它们不是大型、长篇的巨著而不传世；相反地，当我们和我们的后代回忆到过去每一个革命历史时期的人民的斗争生活的时候，人们自然而然地会记起那时候广泛流传的歌曲、活报、短剧、诗歌来。只要他们每一次唱起抗战歌曲、革命歌曲中的任何一句两句，那些革命狂飚中的英雄人民的伟大气概便会出现在眼前，给人以鼓舞斗志的效力。要说不朽，这样的艺术不正是不朽的吗？
    在整风和反右派斗争前的相当一个时候，文艺界在资产阶级思想的严重影响之下，产生了反对所谓“赶任务”，看不起短小的文艺形式，嘲笑多产作家，不愿意为工农群众演出等邪气歪风。有的歌唱家表示，非“提高”的歌曲不唱，偶然唱了一支群众歌曲，因而受到了听众的欢迎，歌唱家反而会悲伤起来，叹息群众水平太低，不懂音乐！有的文艺家在民主革命时代热情澎湃，及时创作了富于时代气息的作品，可是到了社会主义革命时代，反而趑趄不前，干劲不足。有的人甚至情绪消沉，思想灰暗，和社会主义精神格格不入。有的人又表示只愿写大作品，而对所谓小东西不屑一顾。有些右派分子和修正主义者更明目张胆地攻击社会主义文艺是“只顾眼前的政治宣传任务”，讥笑文艺为政治服务是做“政治概念的传声筒”。他们侈谈什么文艺的“长远性的要求”，唯恐文艺脱离政治不够远！这和鲁迅所说的“于现在有意义，才于将来有意义”的道理，和毛泽东同志所提倡的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，是多么背道而驰！
    由于反右派斗争的胜利，整风运动的深入展开，在全国范围内进行了政治上思想上的社会主义大革命，文艺界的思想面貌也发生了极大的改变，资产阶级文艺思想的束缚已经基本上摆脱，文艺领域里出现了崭新的风气，大批作家艺术家下乡上山，艺术团体到农村工地去演出，许多城市乡村的社会主义歌咏运动已经展开，群众业余创作非常活跃，农村生产大跃进中的民歌民谣大量产生，真是一派蓬蓬勃勃的新气象！浙江省的专业作者、业余作者和演员们，在参加浙江文艺界创作大跃进的誓师大会以后，在三天当中，就创作了几十个节目，其中包括了此次演出的一些新鲜活泼的作品，便是整个文艺界大跃进中的一个很好的例子。
    群众既需要作家艺术家创作大型、长篇的巨著，也需要他们写大量的短小形式的作品。文艺家必须坚决地投入工农群众中去，长期地和群众共同生活，共同劳动，“长线放远鸢”，为写出足以概括一个时代的人民斗争生活的长篇积累丰富的原料。但是，群众生产建设的劲头那么大，形势的发展那么快，群众对文化的要求那么迫切，热心于为群众服务的作家就不能够慢吞吞地来写，等十年八年之后才端出作品来。花较长时间才能写出的大的作品无疑是需要的，大时代需要有大作品；然而目前，更多需要的是迅速写出能够及时满足群众需要的各种短小形式的作品，小作品写得好一样可以成为杰作。群众要歌就给歌，要快板就给快板，要小戏就给小戏。迅速地反映先进人物、先进事迹，为当前政治任务服务，这是每个文艺工作者的义不容辞的职责。我们的文艺工作者应该把长期深入群众和及时反映群众生活密切结合起来，应当永远做政治上的革命派和生产上的促进派。
    六亿人民正在乘风破浪地跃进，让社会主义的熏风吹起文艺家的灵感来吧！
