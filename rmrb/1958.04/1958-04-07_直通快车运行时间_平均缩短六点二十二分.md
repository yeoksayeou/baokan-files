    Through Express Train Travel Times
    Average Reduction of Six Hours and Twenty-Two Minutes
    (Our Newspaper) News – The anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement within the railway system of the Ministry of Railways has brought good news to passengers. The operating speed of passenger trains nationwide will be greatly accelerated. According to preliminary calculations, through express trains alone (i.e., express trains that cross the jurisdictions of two railway administrations) can reduce travel time by an average of six hours and twenty-two minutes per train. Currently, the Ministry of Railways is stepping up the preparation of the 1958 summer timetable. Once the new timetable is implemented, passenger trains across the country will transport passengers at a new speed.
    During the "double anti" movement, the Beijing Railway Administration first conducted experiments to accelerate operating speeds between Beijing and Tianjin, proving that there is great potential for shortening passenger train travel times. Based on this experience of the Beijing Railway Administration, the Ministry of Railways organized trial runs between Beijing and Shenyang. This section is 843 kilometers long, and the travel time for special express trains can be shortened from the original 13 hours and 55 minutes to 11 hours and 59 minutes. When compiling the 1958 summer timetable, with the cooperation of relevant units, it can be further shortened to 11 hours and 45 minutes. Subsequently, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Railways, the Beijing, Zhengzhou, and Guangzhou Railway Administrations organized trial runs between Beijing and Guangzhou, and the Shanghai Railway Administration also organized trial runs between Shanghai and Nanjing. Other railway administrations also took action successively, similarly proving that shortening passenger train travel times is entirely possible.
    Shortening passenger train travel times not only saves the time of millions of passengers but also greatly improves the utilization efficiency of locomotives and rolling stock. According to preliminary calculations, shortening the travel time of through passenger trains alone can save 216 passenger cars. This will greatly help solve the difficulty of passenger car shortages in recent years and can also save the country a large amount of investment. (Fu)

    直通快车运行时间
    平均缩短六点二十二分
    本报讯　铁道部系统的反浪费、反保守运动给旅客们带来了好消息，全国铁路旅客列车的运行速度将大大加快。据初步核算，只直通快车一项（即跨过两个管理局所辖地段的快车）平均每列可缩短运行时间六点二十二分。现在，铁道部正加紧编制1958年夏季运行图。一待新的运行图开始实行，全国旅客列车将以新的速度接送旅客。
    在双反运动中，北京铁道管理局首先在北京、天津间作了加快运行速度的试验，证明缩短旅客列车的运行时间大有潜力。铁道部根据北京局的这个经验，又组织了北京、沈阳间的试车。这一段全长八百四十三公里，特别快车的运行时间可以由原来的十三点五十五分，缩短为十一点五十九分；编制1958年夏季运行图时，在有关单位的协作下，可进一步缩短为十一点四十五分。随后，根据铁道部的指示，北京、郑州、广州三个铁路管理局又在北京、广州间组织了试车，上海铁路管理局也在上海、南京间组织了试车，其他铁路管理局也相继行动起来，同样证明了缩短旅客列车的运行时间是完全可能的。
    缩短旅客列车的运行时间，不但可以节省千千万万旅客的时间，而且能大大提高机车车辆的运用效率。据初步计算，仅缩短直通旅客列车的运行时间这一项，就可节省客车二百一十六辆。这对解决几年来客车不足的困难有很大的作用，也可为国家节约大批投资。（夫）
