This newspaper's reporter from Nanning, Gong Jingzhi and Li Yifang report: In the drought resistance and rice transplanting campaign, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is carrying out a large-scale collaborative effort with cities supporting rural areas and mountainous areas supporting plains.

　　"An instant of spring is worth a thousand pieces of gold." In order to complete the early rice transplanting work in a timely manner, a large number of urban laborers have gone to the countryside. In the Yishan Special District alone, more than 238,000 cadres, teachers, students, and urban residents have gone to the countryside to support farmers in fighting drought and rushing to transplant rice seedlings. In this special district, from the special district to the county, district, and township organs, all cadres except for a few who remained to take care of office work have gone deep into the front line of drought resistance and rice transplanting. Some counties, districts, and townships moved their offices to the fields and construction sites, and leading cadres labored while directing production. More than 2,800 primary and secondary school teachers and students in Qianjiang and Laibin towns in Laibin County, carrying buckets and washbasins, went to nearby agricultural cooperatives to help scoop water and transplant rice seedlings. Some handicraft workers also brought their production tools to the fields and construction sites to repair water lifting tools for farmers. Many commercial workers delivered goods to the fields, providing supplies while taking time to help farmers with their work.

　　Farmers in mountainous areas are very concerned about farmers in the plains. Agricultural cooperatives in eight mountainous townships such as Dazhai, Sanhe, and Lidang in Mashan County, which have already completed corn cultivation, organized thousands of shock troops overnight and rushed to the eight plain townships such as Linyu and Shitang, where the drought situation was serious. They made a guarantee to the farmer brothers in the plain townships: We will not return to the mountains until the task is completed. Yao and Zhuang farmers in the mountainous areas of Fengwu District in Pingguo County proposed: In order to seize the season and make progress together, we guarantee to provide people, cattle, and tools to support the plain townships. On April 6, 378 Yao and Zhuang farmers from four townships including Longjiang and Shanhuan in this district went down the mountain with a large number of plows and tools to support the Siren Township Agricultural Cooperative. This township's rice transplanting progress was originally very slow due to insufficient labor, but with the support of the mountainous farmers, the transplanting speed has more than doubled, and the transplanting work has now been completed.

　　Agricultural cooperatives in the plain areas have also broken down administrative divisions and cooperative boundaries, and are more closely united and cooperating to support each other. Shilong County has a mutual aid support team of 10,000 people, and Liucheng County has more than 8,000 laborers and more than 3,000 cattle, carrying out large-scale support between cooperatives and teams. The five agricultural cooperatives of Changtang and Guliu in Shilong County, which have completed the transplanting task, are making every effort to use water reasonably and sparingly, concentrating the water from the original ditches to turn small water into large water to support the rice transplanting of the water-deficient Dabao Agricultural Cooperative. The Han farmers in Guyi District of Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, who were transplanting quickly, heard that the Doujiang District, a gathering place for neighboring Zhuang and Yao ethnic groups, was transplanting slowly due to a shortage of cattle, so they immediately selected 110 strong cattle to support them.

### 城市支援农村　山区支援平原  广西抗旱插秧大协作

    城市支援农村　山区支援平原
    广西抗旱插秧大协作
    本报南宁22日电　记者宫敬之、李益芳报道：广西僮族自治区在抗旱插秧运动中，城市支援农村，山区支援平原，开展了一个全民抗旱插秧大协作。
      “春光一刻值千金”，为了适时地完成早稻插秧工作，大批的城市劳动力下乡，仅宜山专区就有二十三万八千多机关干部、学校师生和城市居民下乡支援农民抗旱抢插。这个专区从专区到县、区、乡机关，除留下几个人照顾机关工作外，其余干部全部深入抗旱插秧第一线。有的县、区、乡把办公室搬到了田间和工地，领导干部一面劳动，一面指挥生产。来宾县的迁江、来宾等镇的二千八百多名中小学师生，带着水桶和脸盆，到附近农业社去帮助戽水插秧。有些手工业工人还带着生产工具，在田间工地为农民修理提水工具。很多商业工作者把商品送到田间，一面供应，一面抽空帮助农民干活。
    山区农民对平原农民十分关切。已经完成玉米中耕的马山县大寨、三合、里当等八个山区乡的农业社，连夜组织了数千人的突击队，赶到旱情严重的林圩、石塘等八个平原乡。他们向平原乡社的农民弟兄提出保证：任务不完成，坚决不回山。平果县凤梧区山区的瑶族、僮族农民提出：为了抢上季节，共同跃进，保证出人、出牛、出工具支援平原乡。4月6日，这个区的龙江、山环等四个乡的三百七十八个瑶、僮族农民带着大批的耕牛、工具下山支援四仁乡农业社。这个乡本来因劳动力不足，插秧进度很慢，在山区农民的支援下，插秧速度加快了两倍多，现在已完成了插秧工作。
    平原区的农业社也打破了行政区划和社界，更加紧密地团结协作互相支援。石龙县有一万人的互助支援大队，柳城县有八千多个劳动力、三千多头耕牛，进行社、队之间的大支援。已经完成插秧任务的石龙县长塘、古六等五个农业社，以最大努力做到合理用水，节约用水，把原有水沟的水集中起来，由小水变大水，支援缺水的大宝农业社插秧。插秧快的三江侗族自治县古宜区汉族农民，听说邻近的僮、瑶族聚居区——斗江区因缺牛插秧慢，便立即挑选了一百一十头壮牛前去支援。
