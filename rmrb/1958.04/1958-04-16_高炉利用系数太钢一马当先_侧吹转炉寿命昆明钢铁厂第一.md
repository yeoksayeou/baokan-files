Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th: The utilization coefficient of No. 1 blast furnace at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant dropped to 0.541 on the 13th, surpassing the national record created by No. 4 and No. 3 blast furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel.

This is the ninth new record created by No. 1 blast furnace at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant since the beginning of this year. The utilization coefficient of this blast furnace is decreasing each time, the time between new records is getting shorter, and the quality indicators have reached 100%. Compared with the last new record, it used 48 kilograms less coke per ton of pig iron, and the smelting intensity also reached the highest level in the country.

Currently, the utilization coefficient of No. 1 blast furnace at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has stabilized at around 0.577, and the output has increased by an average of 39.6% compared to the national plan.

Xinhua News Agency reports: On April 11, the youth steelmaking furnace at Kunming Iron and Steel Plant set a new national record for the lifespan of small acidic side-blown converters with 252 heats.

Since the end of January, when this steelmaking furnace first reached 191 heats, the young workers have redoubled their efforts, conscientiously summarized and promoted the experience of extending the furnace life that time; paying attention to improving the quality of furnace lining, ensuring uniform baking of the furnace, controlling the positive and negative angles within three degrees during blowing, controlling a certain furnace temperature, and frequent inspections. As a result, it successively increased from 191 heats to 227 heats, 231 heats, and 252 heats.

This newspaper reports: In March, national ironmaking production made a great leap forward, with the greatest leap forward coming from the blast furnaces of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. Its utilization coefficient was lower than those of Anshan Iron and Steel, Benxi Iron and Steel, Shijingshan Iron and Steel, and other plants, ranking first in the country. The effective volume utilization coefficients of major blast furnaces nationwide in March are as follows:
	
	Plant Name		Blast Furnace Effective Volume Utilization Coefficient
		Plant Average	Advanced Furnace		Backward Furnace
				Furnace No.	Coefficient	Furnace No.	Coefficient
	Taiyuan Iron and Steel	0.672		1		0.628		2		0.697
	Anshan Iron and Steel	0.682		8		0.64		9		0.742
	Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel	0.694		2		0.689		2		0.699
	Shijingshan Iron and Steel	0.741		1		0.658		11		1.027
	Ma'anshan Iron Plant	0.757		1		0.709		2		0.827
	Benxi No. 2 Iron and Steel	0.781		1		0.727		2		0.845
	Kunming Iron and Steel	0.794
	Daye Iron and Steel	0.846
	Chongqing Iron and Steel	0.871		1		0.819		2		1.000
	Xuanhua Iron Plant West Workshop	0.935		3		0.874		2		1.046
	Xuanhua Iron Plant East Workshop	1.530		1		1.475		2		1.593

(Note) 1. The most advanced blast furnace in the country in January was No. 4 blast furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel, with a utilization coefficient of 0.675, and in February it was No. 8 blast furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel, with a coefficient of 0.652.
2. The effective volume utilization coefficient of a blast furnace indicates the effective volume occupied by a blast furnace producing one ton of pig iron per day and night. The lower the utilization coefficient, the more advanced the production.

    高炉利用系数太钢一马当先
    侧吹转炉寿命昆明钢铁厂第一
    据新华社太原15日电　太原钢铁厂一号高炉的利用系数在13日降低到零点五四一，再次超过鞍钢四号和三号高炉所创造的全国纪录。
    这次已经是太原钢铁厂一号高炉今年以来创造的第九次新纪录了。这个高炉的利用系数一次比一次降低，新纪录出现的时间距离一次比一次短，质量指标也达到100％。同上次新纪录比较，这次炼每一吨生铁少用了四十八公斤焦炭，冶炼强度也达到全国最高水平。
    目前太原钢铁厂一号高炉的利用系数已经稳定在○·五七七左右，产量比国家计划平均提高39.6％。
    据新华社讯　昆明钢铁厂青年炼钢炉，4月11日又以二百五十二炉的成绩，创造了小型酸性侧吹转炉炉寿全国最新纪录。
    这个炼钢炉自1月底头次达到一百九十一炉后，青工们干劲倍增，认真总结并推广了那次延长炉寿的经验；注意提高砌炉质量，做到炉子烘烤均匀，吹炼时正负角度不超过三度，控制一定的炉温和勤检查等。因此陆续从一百九十一炉提高到二百二十七炉、二百三十一炉和二百五十二炉。
    本报讯　3月份全国炼铁生产有很大的跃进，其中跃进最大的是太原钢铁厂的高炉。它的利用系数比鞍钢、本溪、石景山等厂的都低，跃居全国第一位。3月份全国主要高炉的有效容积利用系数如下：厂　名    高炉有效容积利用系数	  全厂平均	先进炉	           落后炉			炉号	系数	炉号	系数太原钢铁厂	0.672	1	0.628	2	0.697鞍钢炼铁厂	0.682	8	0.64	9 	0.742本溪第一炼铁厂	0.694	2	0.689	2	0.699石景山钢铁厂	0.741	1	0.658	11	1.027马鞍山铁厂	0.757	1	0.709	2	0.827本溪第二炼铁厂	0.781	1	0.727	2	0.845昆明钢铁厂	0.794大冶钢厂	0.846重庆钢铁公司	0.871	1	0.819	2	1.000宣化铁厂西车间	0.935	3	0.874	2	1.046宣化铁厂东车间	1.530	1	1.475	2	1.593
    （注）1、全国最先进高炉1月是鞍钢4号高炉，利用系数是0.675，2月是鞍钢8号高炉，系数是0.652。
    2、高炉有效容积利用系数是表示高炉每昼夜生产一吨生铁占用的有效容积，利用系数越低生产越先进。
