    Strengthen the Discipline of Rightists
    A Cadre from Changchun City, Mu Lin
    Rightists are anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist individuals; they are our enemies. Although we do not treat them as counter-revolutionaries and give them a chance to redeem themselves through meritorious service and reform themselves to become new people, we should strengthen the management and education of them so that they can be better reformed. Recently, some units here have not paid attention to this. For example, one unit allowed a rightist to give lectures to employees. This rightist even brought his newlywed wife and participated in evening parties everywhere, acting very proud. Another unit had a rightist who got drunk late at night and sang loudly in the street, and no one cared. There was also a unit that actually allowed a rightist to draft reports and documents, sent him out to inspect work, and even had him deliver a farewell speech to the cadres being sent to lower levels. These phenomena have aroused great dissatisfaction among the masses, who said: "It's really outrageous." I think the masses are right. After the anti-Rightist struggle, the reactionary arrogance of the rightists had just been suppressed, and the leaders of these units had already forgotten the pain once the wound healed. We are now opposing waste, opposing conservatism, and sweeping away the "five airs." Let us rise up and sweep away this kind of paralysis as well.

    加强对右派分子的管教
    长春市一干部　穆麟
    右派分子是反党反人民反社会主义的人，是我们的敌人，虽然我们不把他们当反革命分子来处理，给他们以立功赎罪，重新作人改造的机会。但是应该加强对他们的管理和教育，这样才能更好的改造他们。最近我们这里有些单位对这点就很不注意。比如有一个单位，让一个右派分子去给职工讲课，这个右派分子并带着新婚的爱人，到处参加晚会，非常神气。另一个单位的一个右派分子，一天深夜喝的熏熏大醉，在大街上高唱也没人管。还有一个单位，竟让右派分子起草报告文稿，派出去检查工作，并让他给下放干部致欢送词。这些现象都引起了群众的极大不满，群众说：真是岂有此理。我看群众说的很对。经过反右派斗争，刚刚把右派分子的反动气焰打下去，这些单位的领导人，就又好了疮疤忘了疼。现在正在反浪费反保守扫五气，让我们起来把这种麻痹症也一股脑儿反掉扫光吧。
