Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The color feature film "Lin's Shop," adapted from Mao Dun's short story of the same name, began shooting on location in Linghu Town, Zhejiang Province, in early April by the Beijing Film Studio.

"Lin's Shop" was adapted into a screenplay by playwright Xia Yan. Because the Beijing Film Studio has taken various measures to shorten film production time during the Great Leap Forward, this film will be completed by the end of July.

The color feature film "Shanghai Girl," produced by the Beijing Film Studio, has been completed. The filming of the feature films "Visiting Relatives" and "Waves of Life," and the wide-screen color documentary "A Sunday in Beijing" have also been completed.

    新华社18日讯　根据茅盾的短篇小说“林家铺子”改编的同名彩色故事片，4月初由北京电影制片厂在浙江菱湖镇开始拍摄外景。
    “林家铺子”由剧作家夏衍改编为电影剧本。由于北京电影制片厂在大跃进中采取各种措施缩短影片生产时间，这部影片将在7月底摄制完成。
    北京电影制片厂摄制的彩色故事片“上海姑娘”已经完成。故事片“探亲记”、“生活的浪花”和宽银幕彩色纪录片“北京的星期天”的拍摄工作也已经结束。
