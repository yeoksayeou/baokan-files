    Strike Down "Extravagance"
    In order to strengthen the leadership of higher normal schools, the Ministry of Education specially transferred Comrade Dai Shuren, Deputy Director of the Planning and Finance Department, to Hebei Tianjin Normal College as Vice President. Just as the "Double Anti" movement was being launched with great enthusiasm in colleges and universities across the country, and tens of thousands of big-character posters were fiercely attacking bourgeois ideology, how should Comrade Dai Shuren, as a former senior cadre of the Ministry of Education, take on a new job with a diligent and thrifty style and revolutionary drive? On the contrary, Comrade Dai Shuren first considered his personal enjoyment of life. Before his family went, he first went to Tianjin alone to see the living environment of the college and found that the living conditions prepared for him by the college were not good enough, and there was no spring bed to sleep on. So he prepared to take away the public spring bed and wardrobe with a large glass mirror that he originally received from the Ministry of Education. He also used the excuse that there were too many things and it was inconvenient to take them by train, and asked the administrative section for a large truck. Thus, on March 24, he led his whole family, fully loaded with boxes and sundries, boarded a public truck from the dormitory of the Ministry of Education in Beijing and went straight to Tianjin. We can't help but ask Comrade Dai Shuren: In the upsurge of anti-waste and running schools with diligence and thrift in colleges and universities across the country, why are you indifferent and "go against the tide"? What kind of thinking is dominating you?

    打掉“阔气”
    教育部为了加强高等师范学校的领导，特意抽调计划财务司副司长戴树仁同志到河北天津师范学院当副院长。正当全国高等学校如火如荼地展开“双反”运动，成千成万的大字报火烧资产阶级思想的时候，作为原来教育部的高级干部的戴树仁同志，应该怎样带着勤俭朴素的作风，鼓起革命干劲去走上新的工作岗位呢？可是，相反的，戴树仁同志首先考虑的是个人的生活享受。在全家未去之前，先单身到天津去看了一下该院的生活环境，发现该院给他准备的居住条件不够好，睡觉没有弹簧床。于是他就准备将他原来所领用的教育部公家的弹簧床和带有大玻璃镜的衣柜等物带走。又借口东西多，坐火车带去不便，向行政科要了一辆大卡车。于是，在3月24日，就带领一家老小，满载箱笼杂物，乘坐公家大卡车，由北京教育部的宿舍上车直放天津去了。我们不禁要问戴树仁同志：在全国高等学校进行反浪费和勤俭办学的热潮中，你为什么无动于衷，“反其道而行之”，是什么思想在支配着你呢？
