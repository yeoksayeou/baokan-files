Wild Game Restaurant

    (Our report) The Zhuyuanchang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fengjie County, Sichuan, has opened a new restaurant. It doesn't require the state to supply a single grain of rice or a pound of meat, yet it can provide a large variety of delicious dishes, including steamed, stir-fried, stewed, noodles, and fried sauce noodles, as well as fine wine. Eating at this restaurant is not only cheap, but also doesn't require grain coupons.
    This is a rare thing: the Fengjie County Supply and Marketing Cooperative discovered that there are many wild animals and plants in the mountainous areas that can be used as food. Therefore, it decided to use wild animals and plants as raw materials to try to open a restaurant, saving grain for the country and providing convenience to the masses. The Zhuyuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative, based on the principle of "what is produced, what is harvested, and what is sold" locally, encourages mountain farmers to hunt birds and animals, and collect edible grass roots and wild fruits, selling them to this restaurant.
    The new restaurant uses these wild ingredients to make a total of forty or fifty kinds of delicious and palatable foods. For meals, there are various soups and noodles made from turmeric powder and fern powder; for dishes, there are various steamed dishes, stir-fried dishes, and soups made from wild chicken, pigeons, sparrows, crabs, snails, loach, and goat meat; there is also fine wine brewed from wild jujubes. Since its opening, this restaurant has been very popular among the local masses.
    Now, the Fengjie County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to promote the use of edible wild animals and plants to run restaurants throughout the county. (Zhou Piaoping)

    野味餐馆
    本报讯　四川奉节县竹园场供销社新开了一家餐馆。它不要国家供应一颗粮食、一斤肉，却能大量供应各种佳肴美菜，有蒸的、有炒的、有炖的、有烩面、炸酱面，还有美酒。上这家餐馆不但价钱便宜，还不要粮票。
    这是件稀奇的事：奉节县供销社发现山区有许多可以当食品用的野生动植物，于是就决定利用野生动植物作原料，来试办餐馆，为国家节省粮食，方便群众。竹园供销社就根据当地“产什么、收什么、卖什么”的原则，鼓励山区农民猎捕飞鸟走兽，采掘可以食用的草根野果，卖给这个餐馆。
    新餐馆利用这些野味，共作出了四、五十种味美可口的食品。当饭吃的有黄姜粉、蕨台粉等作的各种汤面、烩面等等；当菜吃的，有用野鸡、斑鸠、麻雀、螃蟹、田螺、泥鳅、山羊肉作的各种蒸菜、炒菜和汤菜；还有用山枣酿出的美酒。这家餐馆自开张以来，很受当地群众欢迎。
    现在奉节县供销社、已决定在全县推广利用可食的野生动物植物来办餐馆。　（周飘萍）
