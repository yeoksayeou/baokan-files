　　A Second Look After Half a Year
　　Zang Kejia
　　Guanzhuang, Guanzhuang, no one cared,
　　The "free kingdom" was well-known,
　　Last winter it was in the news,
　　The news was shocking!
　　Bad guys and hooligans roamed the streets,
　　Flies buzzed even in winter,
　　Girls dared not walk dark paths,
　　Afraid of having their leather shoes stolen.
　　The number of agencies and cadres was not small,
　　But the production situation was a mess,
　　Each guarding their own "territory,"
　　Nothing was coordinated.
　　A second look after half a year,
　　Guanzhuang is in the news again,
　　Today Guanzhuang has greatly changed,
　　A new socialist atmosphere.
　　Not picking up things left on the road has become the norm,
　　Bad people and bad deeds have been eliminated,
　　More production, less waste,
　　A good attitude of being masters.
　　Everyone is happily busy with elections,
　　Ideological progress, high enthusiasm,
　　A rectification campaign changes everything,
　　Politics takes command, the Party leads.

    事隔半年另眼看
    臧克家管庄管庄没人管，“自由王国”大有名，去年冬天上了报，消息叫人吃一惊！坏蛋流氓满街跑，冬天嗡嗡飞苍蝇，女孩不敢走黑道，脱下皮鞋怕丢掉。机关、干部倒不少，生产情况一团糟，彼此各自守“本位”，样样事儿不协调。事隔半年另眼看，管庄又在报上见，今天管庄大变样，社会主义新气象。路不拾遗成风气，坏人坏事都除掉，增产多来浪费少，主人翁的态度好。人人欢腾忙选举，思想进步热情高，一场整风百事变，政治挂帅党领导。
