　　Robeson and Black Folk Songs
    Zhao Feng

    Whenever American black folk songs are mentioned, people always think of the characteristics of this type of folk song in terms of content: either religious hymns with strong religious overtones or raucous, chaotic "jazz" music. This is actually a misunderstanding, and the person who clarified this misunderstanding is Paul Robeson.
    Black people from various African tribes were sold to the Americas as slaves and forced to accept a foreign religion - Christianity. Therefore, many Christian scriptural phrases, stories from the Bible, etc., heavily seeped into black folk songs. At first glance, these hymns or prayers called "Spirituals" are indeed full of Christian doctrines and otherworldly thoughts, especially fantasies about heaven and the afterlife. But looking a little deeper into the content of these folk songs, the pursuit of heaven and paradise is actually a yearning for freedom:

    Walk together children, don't you get weary,
    There's a great camp meeting in the promised land.
    Walk together children, don't you get weary,
    There's a great camp meeting in the promised land.
        (Black Folk Song: Walk Together Children)

    This black folk song, called a hymn, is, as Robeson said: "Far from religious concepts. This is a national anthem, the suffering and struggle of the entire nation, hopes and aspirations...are all embodied in these hymns."
    As for "jazz" music, it has indeed been greatly influenced by black folk songs, namely the infinite variations in rhythm, simple but extraordinarily harmonious harmonies, and improvisational singing styles. This also proves that the claim by some Americans that black folk songs are a product of "Christian culture" is absurd and untrustworthy because the musical characteristics mentioned above are precisely the characteristics of the ancient musical culture of various African black tribes. After "jazz" music has been thoroughly commercialized in capitalist America, it has degenerated into something that is sexually stimulating and pathologically crazy, which can be said to have no connection with black folk songs.
    Therefore, when we listen to Robeson singing black folk songs, what we are hearing is a national anthem, the pain and groans of oppressed black people, the beautiful vision of a better future, and the indomitable struggle for freedom.
    Robeson, as a master artist, presents the true face of his nation's precious musical culture to the people of the world, allowing the people of the world to recognize the brilliant value of the folk music treasures of the most musically gifted black nation. As a singer, Robeson has established his own unique school, which is a simple and pure method of expression, without any showing off or exaggeration of skills and sounds. This singing method combined with beautiful folk songs is really wonderful.
    Robeson is not only a great artist; starting from the belief that "music is a social weapon," he dedicated his singing to the cause of liberation for the black people and the cause of world peace.

　　罗伯逊和黑人民歌
    赵沨
    提起美国黑人民歌，人们总会想起这种民歌在内容上的特点：或者是有着浓厚宗教色彩的祷歌，或者是嚣然、纷乱的“爵士”音乐。这实际是一种误解，而把这种误解加以澄清的人，就是保罗·罗伯逊。
    非洲各族黑人被贩卖到美洲各地当奴隶，并被强迫接受一种异族的宗教——基督教。所以，许多基督教经文的词句、圣经中的故事等等，大量渗入到黑人的民歌中去。乍一看来，这被称为“Spirituals” 的圣歌或祷歌的确充满着基督教教义和出世思想，特别是对天国和来世的幻想。但略加深入地看看这些民歌的内容，对天堂、乐园的追求实际上是对自由的渴望：
    走开吧，逃走吧，
    走去见耶稣！
    逃走吧，逃回故乡，
    我不能永远在异乡居住。
    我主呼唤我，
    他用雷声呼唤我，
    号角响了，
    我不能永远在异乡居住。
        （黑人民歌：逃走吧）
    这首被称为圣歌的黑人民歌，正如罗伯逊所说：“跟宗教的观念相距甚远。这是民族的颂歌，全民族的苦难和斗争，希望和向往……都在这些圣歌里得到了体现。”
    至于“爵士”音乐，的确也受到黑人民歌的重大影响，那就是节奏的无穷变化，单纯但异常和谐的和声，和即兴的演唱风格。这也同时证明有些美国人企图把黑人民歌说成是“基督教文化”的产儿的说法是荒谬而不足为信的，因为上面所说的音乐上的特点正是非洲各族黑人古老的音乐文化的特征。“爵士”音乐在资本主义美国彻头彻尾商品化之后，已经堕落为色情刺激、变态疯狂的东西了，这和黑人民歌可以说没有丝毫关系。
    所以，当我们听罗伯逊唱黑人民歌时，我们听到的正是一个民族的颂歌，受尽压迫的黑人的痛苦和呻吟，对美好未来的美丽的憧憬，以及争取自由的不屈的斗争。
    罗伯逊，作为一个艺术大师，把自己民族的珍贵的音乐文化的真正面目展示在世界人民之前，使世界人民认识了最有音乐天赋的黑人民族的民间音乐宝藏的光辉的价值。作为歌唱家，罗伯逊建立了自己的独特的学派，那就是质朴、纯真的表现方法，对技巧、声音不作丝毫的卖弄和夸张，这种演唱方法和美丽如珠玉的民歌结合在一起，实在是太好了。
    罗伯逊不仅是伟大的艺术大师；他从“音乐是一种社会武器”的信念出发，把他的歌唱献给了黑人民族的解放事业和世界和平事业。
