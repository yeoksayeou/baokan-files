    "Wipe Out Sparrows"
    The Central Newsreel Film Studio has produced many documentaries about the patriotic health campaign. Among them, the short documentary "Wipe Out Sparrows" is very fresh and interesting. It introduces the sparrow-catching movement of the masses in Heden Township, Xinfan County, Sichuan Province.
    Sichuan Province uses the "encirclement" method to catch sparrows. From the film, we see the massive scene of catching sparrows: regardless of men, women, old or young, day or night, people are taking bird guns, bamboo poles, and going to the fields, bamboo forests, and fields to catch sparrows; shouts, gongs and drums, gunshots and the sound of hitting bamboo tubes rise and fall one after another; all the trees and bamboo forests seem to be shaking. After several days and nights of this, the sparrows have no choice but to fly around in the air non-stop, without any chance to catch their breath or find a place to land, and they can't get any food either. Finally, they fall from the sky in extreme exhaustion. At this time, we will see the lively scene of joyful people, especially children, picking up sparrows all over the ground. This film has been completed and will be released in theaters across the country in mid-April.　(Cao Cao)

    “围剿麻雀”
    中央新闻纪录电影制片厂拍摄了许多关于爱国卫生运动的纪录片，其中“围剿麻雀”这部短纪录片，非常新鲜、有趣。它介绍了四川省新繁县禾登乡的群众捕麻雀运动。
    四川省捕麻雀用的是“围剿”的办法。从影片中我们看到了声势浩大的捕雀情景：不论是男女老幼，不论是白天黑夜，人们都拿着鸟枪、竹竿，在田间、竹林、田野去捕雀；吆喝声、锣鼓声、枪弹声和击打竹筒声，此起彼伏；所有的树木、竹林似乎都在动摇了。这样连续几昼夜，弄得麻雀只得在空中不停地飞转，没有一点喘息的机会和落脚的地方，也吃不到东西，最后在极度疲劳之下从空中掉下来。这时，我们会看到喜悦的人们，特别是孩子们满地拣麻雀的生动场面。这影片已制作成完，4月中旬即可在全国各地影院上映。　（草草）
