Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline News: At the advanced, more, faster, better, and more economical exhibition of the logistics leading organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Fujian Frontline troops, which opened on the 12th, many construction tools, medical devices, car and ship repair tools, and car and ship parts made by officers and soldiers from waste materials were exhibited. These products have saved the country a lot of money.

The officers and soldiers of the logistics medicine warehouse recently repaired some bent and twisted surgical instrument table old iron frames that had been handed in for scrap, and made seventeen brand-new "double-layer instrument tables" themselves, worth more than 1,000 yuan. Su Yonghai, a storage worker at an oil depot, used broken small lead pipes to make a "mixing oil gun," and used this tool to extract 5,000 catties of remaining gasoline drop by drop from the submitted empty oil drums. A certain unit's shipyard and auto repair shop made dozens of types of car and ship machine parts and repair tools from old copper and iron dug up and salvaged from underground and in the water. The quality of these new products is very good.

    勤俭建军的一例
    用废旧物资制造军需品
    新华社福建前线讯　在12日开幕的中国人民解放军福建前线部队后勤领导机关比先进、比多快好省展览会上，展出了官兵们用废旧物资制作的许多施工用具、医疗器械、修车修船工具和车船零件，这些产品为国家节约了大量资金。
    后勤药材仓库的官兵们，最近把一些上缴报废的弯弯曲曲的手术器械台旧铁架，自己动手修成了十七架崭新的“双层器械台”，价值一千多元。某油库保管员苏永海利用折断的小铅管自制“拌油枪”，并用这个工具从上缴的空油桶中点滴地抽出剩余汽油五千市斤。某部修船厂和修车厂把从地下和水中挖掘和打捞起来的旧铜旧铁，制成了几十种车船机器零件和修理工具，这些新产品的质量都很好。
