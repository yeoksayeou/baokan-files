The Winery Lightly Loads Up the Mountain
Li Wenxian

Last autumn, the Quyang Winery in Hebei stopped production due to a lack of raw materials. Should they continue to sit in the factory, waiting for the state to allocate raw materials, or should they move the factory to the raw material producing area, obtain the raw materials locally, and produce on the spot? This was the fork in the road facing the factory's employees, and it would determine the future direction of the factory's development. Some people said, "There are plenty of jujubes in the deep mountains! Just collect the jujubes!" Others said, "That won't work. The mountain roads are difficult to travel, and the cost of transporting the jujubes down the mountain would be too high, which would increase the cost of the wine. It's better to move the factory up the mountain." Some people said, "That's a good idea, but there are no pulverizers on the mountain to crush the raw materials, and no coolers to distill the wine. The transportation costs for moving these machines to the mountain would be too high." Still others said, "Going up the mountain is good, but there's no canteen for eating, no dormitory for sleeping, no workshop for production, and no office for working. It's too inconvenient." In the end, factory director Cao Xin spoke: "We should go to the mountainous area, move the factory up the mountain, bring the technology up the mountain, and produce on the spot in the raw material producing area, helping the mountain area farmers develop the mountain economy through industrial production. If we serve the farmers, the farmers will help us overcome difficulties."

On September 25th last year, nine employees of the winery, led by the factory director, carrying luggage rolls and a large pot, and the accountant carrying a few accounting books, lightly loaded up and set off for the deep mountainous area. The destination was Chi'an Township in the deep mountains.

Chi'an Township is located in the mountainous area at the junction of Quyang and Fuping. Dense jujube forests grow in the mountain gullies, and more than one million jin of jujubes can be harvested each year. However, because it is far from the county seat and the mountain roads are difficult to travel, a large number of spoiled jujubes cannot be transported out. When the winery moved in, the villagers were beaming. They were sure that the spoiled jujubes would have a way out.

Construction of the factory began. The workers first dug a dugout at the foot of the mountain and covered it with a layer of sorghum stalks to serve as a dormitory. Members of the agricultural cooperative also came to help. More than a dozen young men dug eighteen fermentation pools for the factory on the spot and also picked up some stones and mud to build stoves. Communist Party member Liu Wen brought the wood for the winery to make wine steamers. The farmers sent forty-two large jars for holding wine. They also brought out the iron pots used for distilling liquor in the past, which could be used as coolers. The "factory" had no pulverizer, so the farmers tore down the earthenware tiles from the walls and built a grinding base, and then carried a large, faceted millstone to make two large grinding mills. In short, apart from buying two bamboo brooms and bringing a pot, all the tools and production equipment of the factory were provided and built with the help of members of the agricultural cooperative. Including the land occupation fee and large jar rental fee, the total cost was seventy-two yuan, and a "factory" producing 600 jin of baijiu per day was built.

After the factory went into production, it brought prosperity to the mountainous area. Every day, donkeys carrying jujubes and crowds buying distiller's grains from nearby villages came and went. The people of the Chi'an Village agricultural cooperative were even busier. Some production teams provided transportation for the factory, some did odd jobs, and some teams used the wastewater from the liquor production to accumulate coarse fertilizer. The transportation team's dozen or so donkeys carried wine down the mountain to Quyang City and brought back coal needed by the factory, making sure they were never empty. From these two items alone, the agricultural cooperative earned more than 1,480 yuan, plus the income from providing labor and animal power for the factory to crush jujubes every day, they earned more than 2,200 yuan in more than three months. It is especially worth mentioning that after the factory started, it greatly supported the development of pig raising in the agricultural cooperative. Distiller's grains are good feed for pigs. The factory, in the spirit of supporting farmers to raise pigs in large numbers, stipulated a very low price. Farmers could buy a large dou (about 50 jin) for only 18 cents. Now almost every household in Chi'an Village has pigs.

The factory had ample raw materials, and the production was changed from one shift to two shifts, day and night, and the daily output of baijiu increased from 300 jin to more than 600 jin. The cost per jin of wine was also reduced from 40 cents to 30 cents. By January 10th of this year, they had produced 51,000 jin of baijiu for the country, saved more than 150,000 jin of grain, and in less than 100 days, they created a profit of 5,200 yuan for the country, paid taxes of more than 12,000 yuan, and the value of goods produced reached more than 32,300 yuan.

    酒厂轻装上山
    李文显
    去年秋天，河北曲阳酒厂因为缺乏原料停工了。是继续坐在厂里，等着国家给调拨原料呢，还是把工厂搬到原料产地，就地取得原料，就地生产呢？这是摆在这个厂职工面前的两条道路，也是决定工厂今后发展方向的问题。有人说，深山里有的是红枣，把枣收来不就行了！有人说，这样不行，山地道路不好走，由山上往下运枣运费太大，会提高酒的成本，还是把工厂搬上山去吧。有人说，这个办法好，就是山上没有粉碎机，无法粉碎原料；没有冷却器，酒无法蒸馏。要把这些器械搬到山地去，运费太高了。有人说，上山固然好，可是那里吃饭没食堂，睡觉没宿舍，生产没有车间，办公没有办公室，太不方便了。最后，厂长曹馨说了话：我们应该到山区去，使工厂上山，技术上山，在山区原料产地，就地生产，通过工业生产，帮助山区农民发展山区经济。我们为农民服务，农民是会帮助我们克服困难的。
    去年9月25日，酒厂的九名职工在厂长率领下，背着行李卷，抬着一口大锅，会计员怀里抱着几本账，就轻装向深山区出发了。目标是深山区的赤岸乡。
    赤岸乡，座落在曲阳和阜平交界的山区，山沟里生长着茂密的枣树林，每年能收红枣一百多万斤。可是，因为这里距县城远，山路难行，大量的坏枣儿运不出来。酒厂搬来了，村里人喜笑颜开。他们确信坏枣有出路了。
    开始建厂了，工人先在山脚下挖了个地窨子，篷上一层秫秸就当宿舍。农业社社员们也赶来帮忙。十几个小伙子就地给工厂挖了十八个发酵池，还拣来一些石头和泥巴，垒成炉灶。共产党员刘文，拿来了酒厂做酒甑的木材。农民们送来了四十二口盛酒用的大缸。过去烧酒用的铁熬，也拿出来了，可以代替冷却器。“工厂”没有粉碎机，农民扒下墙头上的缸瓦片，砌成碾底，又抬来挂棱的大碾砣，盘了两个大碾子。一句话，工厂除买了两把竹扫帚和带来的一口锅以外，所有的工具和生产设备，都是农业社社员送来并帮助建成的。包括土地占用费和大缸租赁费在内，总共花了七十二元，就建成了一个日产六百斤白酒的“工厂”。
    工厂投入生产后，给山区带来一片繁荣景象。每天，附近村庄送枣的毛驴和买糟的人群来来往往。赤岸村农业社的人们更忙，有的生产队给工厂搞运输，有的作零工，有的队则用烧过酒的废水积粗肥。运输队的十几头毛驴，下山往曲阳城驮酒，上山捎回工厂需用的煤炭，来回不放空。只这两项，这个农业社就收入了一千四百八十多元，加上每天出人工、出畜力给工厂轧枣，三个多月就收入了两千二百多元。特别值得一提的是，工厂开工后，大大支持了农业社生猪的发展。酒糟是喂猪的好饲料，工厂本着支援农民大量养猪的精神，规定了很低的价钱，农民只要花上一角八分钱，就能买到溜尖溜尖的一大斗（约五十斤重）。现在赤岸村几乎户户都有了猪。
    工厂有了充足的原料，由一班生产改为昼夜两班，每天产白酒由三百斤增到六百多斤。每斤酒的成本，也由四角钱降为三角。到今年1月10日，他们已给国家生产五万一千斤白酒，节约粮食十五万多斤，不到一百天的时间，就给国家创造利润五千二百元，上缴税收一万二千多元，商品产值达三万二千三百多元。　（编自河北日报）（附图片）
