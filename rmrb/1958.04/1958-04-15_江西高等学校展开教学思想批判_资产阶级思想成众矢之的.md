According to the Jiangxi Daily, four universities and colleges in Jiangxi Province, during the Two-Anti Campaign, have focused on exposing the bourgeois ideas of teachers in teaching and launched an ideological struggle on the two roads of implementing the socialist education policy. Teachers have held forums and engaged in ideological exchanges. Bourgeois ideology in teaching has become the target of public criticism.

Facts revealed by a large number of big-character posters in various universities and colleges prove that bourgeois ideology in teaching is relatively serious among some teachers. One Japanese professor still uses 19th-century textbooks, the content of which is mostly about "Money can do everything," propagating bourgeois ideas. A professor teaching neurology at Jiangxi Medical College compiled lecture notes that are almost entirely American, while his explanation of the Soviet Pavlovian theory is extremely simple and vulgar. He told students that they only need to remember the two sentences: "Objective existence, the primacy of matter." In the teaching of classical literature at Jiangxi Normal College and Nanchang Normal College, there is a tendency to "emphasize the past and belittle the present." Some teachers use their bourgeois emotions to spread fatalism, pessimism, and the poison of love-above-all-else to students in their teaching.

The facts revealed by the big-character posters also prove that many teachers have relatively serious bourgeois individualism and fame-seeking ideas. They are secretive in their research, fearing that others will publish papers first, and some even hide foreign exchange materials and do not show them to teachers in the same department. In order to engage in "sidelines" (writing articles, engaging in creative work), some teachers do not prepare lessons carefully, do not compile teaching materials, stick to old ways in teaching, and are irresponsible. A professor in the Physics Department uses a textbook from 1898. When students raised objections, he said, "That's how my teacher taught me!"

Faced with a large number of revealed facts, teachers, after being educated by the Party, mass debates, and self-ideological struggle, have realized that this is incompatible with implementing the Party's education policy and cultivating both red and expert construction talents for the country. Therefore, they have consciously conducted self-examination and criticism. Associate Professor Ouyang Chen, deputy director of the History Department, said, "When I first saw the opinions raised by the students, I felt pain in my heart, but after the pain, I felt happy." Some teachers also took the initiative to invite students to forums to conduct self-examination on the issues revealed by the big-character posters. At present, teachers in various universities and colleges in Jiangxi are continuing to conduct in-depth examinations and criticisms, and are discussing and formulating red and expert plans.

    江西高等学校展开教学思想批判
    资产阶级思想成众矢之的
    本报讯　据江西日报报道：江西省四所高等学校在双反运动中，集中地揭发了教师们在教学上存在的资产阶级思想，开展了一场在贯彻社会主义教育方针上两条道路的思想斗争。教师们纷纷举行座谈会，进行思想交锋，教学上的资产阶级思想已经成为众矢之的。
    根据各高等学校大量大字报所揭发出来的事实证明，教学上的资产阶级思想在一部分教师中是比较严重的。有一位日语教授至今还在采用十九世纪的教材，内容大都是“只要有钱，万事都行”等宣扬资产阶级思想的货色。江西医学院一位教神经病学的教授所编的讲义，内容几乎都是美国的，而对苏联巴甫洛夫学说却讲得极其简单庸俗，他对学生说只要记住“客观存在、物质第一性”两句话就够了。江西师范学院、南昌师范专科学校的古典文学教学存在着“厚古薄今”的倾向，有的教师用自己的资产阶级思想感情在教学中对学生散布宿命论、悲观情绪以及爱情至上的毒素。
    大字报揭露的事实还证明，不少教师存在着较严重的资产阶级个人主义名利思想。他们在研究上互相保密，怕别人先发表论文，有的甚至把外来的交流材料藏起来不给同科教师看。为了搞“副业”（写文章、搞创作），有的教师不认真备课，不编写教材，教学上抱残守缺，不负责任。物理系一位教授用的是1898年的教材，学生向他提意见，他竟说：“我的先生就是这样教我的！”
    面对着揭发出来的大量事实，教师们经过党的教育、群众性的辩论和自我思想斗争之后，都猛省到这与贯彻党的教育方针、为国家培养又红又专的建设人材的要求，是不相容的，因而纷纷自觉地进行了检查和批判。历史系副主任欧阳琛副教授说：“看到同学们提的意见开初心里感到痛，但痛定思痛还是感到愉快的。”有的教师还主动邀集同学座谈，对大字报所揭发的问题作自我检查。目前，江西各高等学校的教师正在继续深入检查、批判，并讨论制定红专规划。
