    Games That Should Be Prohibited
    Recently, a gambling game has become popular among elementary school students in Haicheng County, Liaoning Province. Many elementary school students gather in groups after class or after dinner to win colored pictures by playing marbles and other games. They sometimes greedily play until late at night, spending their parents' money to buy more and newer colored pictures, thus forming a gambling trend.
    They spend all their spare time on this unhealthy game. If they win by chance, they are beaming with joy and are extremely proud; if they unfortunately lose, they are anxious and uneasy. As a result, these young people bear mental distress. This not only affects elementary school students' learning and health, but also easily leads to bad gambling habits. I hope teachers and parents will pay attention and educate their children not to play this gambling game.　Du Jue

    应该禁止的游戏
    近来辽宁省海城县在小学生中流行着一种赌博性的游戏。许多小学生在下课或晚饭后，成群结伙地聚在一起，用弹球等方式赢些彩色图片。他们有时贪婪地玩到深夜，花掉了父母的金钱，去买更多更新的彩色图片，于是形成一种赌风。
    他们就这样地把整个课外时间，置于这种不健康的游戏中。偶然赢了，就眉飞色舞，得意异常；不幸输了，则焦急不安。于是，在这些少年的心灵上负担了精神上的苦恼。这不仅影响了小学生的学习和健康，而且容易染上好赌博的不良习惯，我希望教师和家长们引起注意，教育孩子们不要玩这种赌博性的游戏。　杜绝
