    Juanda and Sastroamidjojo say
    Cooperation among Asian and African countries can eliminate colonialism
    The Bandung Conference remains a guiding light for Asian and African countries
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 25th. Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda said at a grand banquet held on the evening of the 25th to commemorate the third anniversary of the Bandung Conference that cooperation among Asian and African countries can eliminate colonialism. He reminded people to be vigilant and not to fall into the trap of those who conspire to divide and rule Asian and African countries.
    In his speech, Prime Minister Juanda praised the achievements of the Asian-African Conference and pointed out that a series of non-governmental conferences held by Asian and African countries after the Bandung Conference will surely promote the development of Asian and African people towards maturity, stability, and prosperity.
    Prime Minister Juanda said that the economic recession in the United States will bring economic chaos and depression to Asian and African countries, and only through the joint efforts of Asian and African countries can this impact be overcome or reduced.
    The banquet was attended by diplomatic envoys from Asian and African countries, ministers of the Indonesian government, leaders of various political parties, and well-known social figures.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 26th. New York dispatch: Indonesian Representative to the United Nations, Sastroamidjojo, said on the 25th that the Bandung Conference remains a guiding light for the future progress of Asian and African countries.
    Speaking at a banquet held to commemorate the third anniversary of the Bandung Conference, Sastroamidjojo said that the Bandung Conference was a "positive and solid milestone" in historical development, which brought about the revival and liberation of Asian and African countries.
    He said that the Bandung Conference "is of great significance not only to the people of Asia and Africa, but also to the people in other parts of the world." If the Bandung Conference gave confidence to the people of Asia and Africa, it also gave the people of many other countries food for thought. At this conference, representatives of more than half of the world's population gathered together to discuss the issue of building a moral fortress, not a military fortress, in today's turbulent world. The issues discussed at the Bandung Conference still need to be resolved or even seek solutions today.
    Sastroamidjojo asked the representatives of Asian and African countries to "devote themselves with greater determination to the realization of the lofty goals of Bandung (Conference)."
    Sastroamidjojo said he hoped that the proposal to convene an Asian-African economic conference would yield results in the near future.
    The Indonesian representative also expressed the hope that the principle of universality of the United Nations can be realized, so that countries that are currently not represented in the United Nations for some reason can enter the United Nations.
    In addition to representatives from Asian and African countries, representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, and some countries in Europe and Latin America attended yesterday's banquet.

    朱安达和沙斯特罗阿米佐约说
    亚非国家合作可以消除殖民主义
    万隆会议仍是亚非国家指路明灯
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达25日晚上在为纪念万隆会议召开三周年而举行的盛大宴会上说，亚非国家之间的合作可以消除殖民主义。他提醒人们要保持警惕，不要落入阴谋对亚非国家分而治之的那些人的圈套。
    朱安达总理在讲话中赞扬亚非会议的成就，并且指出，在万隆会议闭幕以后亚非国家召开的一系列的非官方会议一定能够促使亚非人民向成熟、稳定和繁荣发展。
    朱安达总理说，美国的经济衰退会给亚非国家带来经济上的混乱和萧条，只有通过亚非国家的共同努力才能克服或者缩小这种影响。
    参加这次宴会的有亚非国家的外交使节、印度尼西亚政府各部部长、各党派领袖和社会知名人士。
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：印度尼西亚驻联合国代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约25日说，万隆会议仍然是亚非国家将来前进的指路明灯。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约在为了纪念万隆会议三周年而举行的宴会上说，万隆会议是历史发展的一个“积极而坚固的里程碑”，这种历史发展带来了亚非国家的复兴和解放。
    他说，万隆会议“不仅对亚非人民有巨大意义，而且对于世界其他地方的人民也有很大意义。”如果说万隆会议给了亚非人民以信心，那末它也给了其他许多国家的人民以思考的材料。在这次会议上，全世界一半以上人口的代表聚会在一起，讨论在今天不安的世界里建立道义堡垒而不是军事堡垒的问题。万隆会议所讨论的问题今天仍然有待解决或者甚至是寻求解决办法。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约请亚非国家的代表以“更大的决心致力于实现万隆（会议）的崇高目标”。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，他希望关于召开亚非国家经济会议的建议在最近将来能够产生结果。
    这位印度尼西亚代表还表示希望能够实现联合国的普遍性的原则，使目前因为某种原因而在联合国没有代表的国家，能够进入联合国。
    出席昨天宴会的除了亚非国家的代表以外，还有苏联、美国以及欧洲和拉丁美洲一些国家的代表。
