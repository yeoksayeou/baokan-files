Teachers and Parents Should Pay Attention to Students' Extracurricular Reading Materials
	In Hebei Province, Pingxiang County, Hezuo Temple Village, something like this happened: Ten-year-old elementary school students were fighting each other, and one of the boys, Dong Shini, died from his injuries.
	Why did such a serious assault happen? It is understood that these elementary school students all like to read poisonous chivalry comic books. Influenced by the characters in the books, they sometimes put on knight-errant costumes at night and fight each other. After the fights, they would comment on who was the hero and gave themselves names like "Yang Xiangwu" and "Huang Tianba". Because teachers and parents failed to discover these problems in time and provide the necessary education, the incident of beating someone to death occurred.
	I hope that teachers should often check students' extracurricular reading materials, educate and dissuade students from reading those poisonous books, and introduce more good books that are beneficial to children's physical and mental health.

    教师和家长应注意学生的课外读物
    在河北省平乡县河左庙村发生了一件这样的事情：十岁左右的小学生在一块殴打，其中一个叫董拾妮的男孩子，由于受伤太重，已经死去了。
    为什么会发生这样严重的凶打呢？据了解，这些小学生都喜欢看有毒素的侠义小人书。受了书中人物的影响，有时，晚上穿上侠客式的衣裳，在一块凶打。打架后，就评论谁是英雄，并起名叫“杨香武”、“黄天霸”等。由于教师和家长不能及时发现这些问题，给予必要的教育，致使打死人的事情发生了。
    我希望教师应该经常检查学生的课外读物，教育和劝止学生不要看那些有毒素的书籍，多介绍一些对儿童身心有益的好书。
