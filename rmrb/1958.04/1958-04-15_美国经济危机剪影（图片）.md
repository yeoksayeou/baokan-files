    Snapshots of the American Economic Crisis
    This is a photograph taken on April 12th in Pasadena, California, USA, recording the miserable lives of unemployed American workers during the economic crisis. The photo shows Mrs. Martina White and her four children begging on the street. Her husband has only had a few hours of work each week since last September, and his salary is not enough to support the family. They have no choice but to take their children to the street to beg. The oldest child is only nine years old, and the youngest is less than four years old. The sign in front of them reads: "We have borrowed. We don't want to steal. But we are hungry, and relief cannot sustain our lives."

    美国经济危机剪影
    这是4月12日在美国加利福尼亚州帕萨梭市街头拍摄的一张照片，纪录在经济危机中的美国失业工人生活的惨状。照片上是玛丁娜·怀特夫人和她的四个小孩在街头求乞，她的丈夫自从去年9月以来每星期只有几小时的工作，所得薪金无法维持一家人的生活，只得带着孩子到街上求乞。最大的孩子才九岁。最小的还不足四岁。在他们前面的标语上写着：“我们已经借贷了。我们不愿偷窃。可是，我们肚子饿，救济不能维持我们的生活。”
