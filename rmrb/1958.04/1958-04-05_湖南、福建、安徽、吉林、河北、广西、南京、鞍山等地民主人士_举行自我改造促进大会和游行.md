Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. Nearly 30,000 democratic personages from various democratic parties and non-party democrats in Hunan, Fujian, Anhui, Jilin, Hebei, Guangxi, Nanjing, Anshan, and other places recently held socialist self-remolding promotion conferences and parades.

Responsible persons of local organizations of various democratic parties and representatives from various fields spoke at the self-remolding promotion conferences, solemnly stating that they would give their hearts to the Communist Party, dedicate their knowledge to the people, take big strides to resolutely follow the socialist road, and transform themselves into leftists as soon as possible. Xu Shou-xuan, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said at the conference held in Jilin Province and Changchun City that the situation in the country requires us to "burn our boats and sink our ships," that is, break the "pot" of the bourgeoisie and sink the "boat" of the bourgeoisie, to achieve a great leap forward in self-remolding. Cheng Sheng-san, Standing Committee member of the Jilin Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that the industrial and commercial circles in Jilin Province and Changchun City are launching a competition to hand over their hearts to the Party, and some private personnel have automatically moved into the enterprises, determined to run the enterprises well. Dai An-bang, Director of the Chemistry Department of Nanjing University, said at the socialist self-remolding promotion conference held by teachers of Nanjing University: "To transform ourselves, we must give our hearts to the Party and follow the Party wholeheartedly. Otherwise, there is no way to serve socialism. Our lives are supported by the working people of today, and our knowledge is accumulated by the working people of the past. Therefore, we must never use knowledge as personal capital to bargain for treatment and status, and we must hand over knowledge to the people and use it as a tool to serve the people."

After holding the socialist self-remolding promotion conferences, democratic parties and non-party democratic personages in various places enthusiastically held parades. Designers from the Anshan Branch of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute carried signboards during the parade, stating that they had rescued 230 million yuan in investment during the Double-Anti Movement, which could be used to build twenty-three 1,000-cubic-meter blast furnaces or buy 1.05 billion jin of rice. Many white-haired old people also participated in the parade with great vigor. Gao Bei-xia, a 68-year-old professor from Anhui Province, said during the parade that this was the first time he had participated in a parade since liberation, and he would definitely promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, striving to be a red and expert intellectual. When all the teachers of Nanjing University and Nanjing Forestry College set off for the parade, the students welcomed them with gongs, drums, and firecrackers along the way.

In many places, when the parade teams passed the locations of the provincial and municipal Party committees, they were received by the responsible persons of the Party committees. The secretaries of the Jiangsu and Hebei Provincial Party Committees also exchanged opinions with them in a cordial manner.

    湖南、福建、安徽、吉林、河北、广西、南京、鞍山等地民主人士
    举行自我改造促进大会和游行
    新华社4日讯　湖南、福建、安徽、吉林、河北、广西、南京、鞍山等地各民主党派和无党派民主人士近三万人，不久前分别举行社会主义自我改造促进大会和游行。
    各民主党派地方组织的负责人和各方面的代表人士在自我改造促进大会上发言，庄严地表示：把心交给共产党，把知识献给人民，迈开大步坚决走社会主义道路，把自己早日改造成为左派。民盟吉林省委员会主任委员徐寿轩在吉林省和长春市举行的大会上说，全国的形势要求我们必须“破釜沉舟”，即破资产阶级之“釜”，沉资产阶级之“舟”，来一个自我改造的大跃进。吉林省工商联常务委员成盛三说，吉林省、长春市工商界正掀起向党交心的竞赛，有些私方人员已经自动搬到企业里，决心经营好企业。南京大学化学系主任戴安邦，在南京大学教师举行的社会主义自我改造促进大会上说：“要改造自己，必须把心交给党，一心一意跟着党走。不然就谈不上为社会主义服务。我们的生活是现在的劳动人民供养的，我们的知识是以前的劳动人民所积累的。因此，我们绝不能把知识作为个人计较待遇和地位的资本，一定要把知识交给人民，作为自己为人民服务的工具。”
    各地民主党派和无党派民主人士在召开社会主义自我改造促进大会以后，都热情地举行了游行。黑色冶金设计院鞍山分院的设计师们游行时抬着标语牌，表示他们在双反运动中已经抢救出二亿三千万元投资，用这笔钱可以修筑一千立方公尺的高炉二十三座；可以买十亿五千万斤大米。许多白发苍苍的老人，也精神抖擞地参加了游行。安徽省六十八岁的老教授高被遐在游行时说，这是我解放以来第一次参加游行，我一定要兴无灭资，争取做个又红又专的知识分子。南京大学和南京林学院全体教师游行出发时，学生们还在锣鼓爆竹声中夹道欢送。
    许多地方的游行队伍，在经过中共省、市委员会所在地时，受到了党委负责人的接见。江苏、河北等省中共省委书记还同他们亲切地交换了意见。
