Using Technology to Support Local Industry
Chongqing University Establishes Collaborative Relationships with Factories

    (Our dispatch) Chongqing University has recently established collaborative relationships with many local industrial factories and mines, using the school's technical expertise to help factories and mines solve production technology problems, supporting the leap forward in industry.

    During the all-round great leap forward, some factories and mines had weak technical capabilities and could not adapt to the demands of the new situation in a timely manner. The Beibei Su Steel Plant specializes in producing agricultural tool steel, which farmers greatly need, but the production method was backward, the quality was low, and the cost was high. The general qualified steel only accounted for about 20%. Chongqing University established a collaborative relationship with this factory, with the Department of Metallurgy responsible for studying how to improve the quality of steel and helping the factory change its technical outlook. Some factories lacked the technical strength to research the performance of materials and design blueprints when trial-producing new products. These factories established relationships with Chongqing University and received help from the school. The Department of Mechanical Engineering helped Chongqing Metrology Instrument Factory analyze the materials used in the new product "bent tube pressure gauge." Various departments also undertook the design and trial production of new products for many factories. The Department of Power Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering contracted the entire set of tasks for the design and installation of hydropower stations in various agricultural cooperatives in Shapingba District, as well as the training of technical workers.

    Currently, Chongqing University has established more than 40 collaborative projects with various factories, and various departments have begun to take active action.

### 用技术支援地方工业  重庆大学和工厂建立协作关系

    用技术支援地方工业
    重庆大学和工厂建立协作关系
    本报讯　重庆大学最近和很多地方工业厂矿建立了协作关系，利用学校的技术力量帮助厂矿解决生产技术问题，支援了工业的跃进。
    在全面跃进中，有些厂矿技术力量较差，不能及时适应新的形势要求。北碚苏钢厂专门生产农具钢，农民很需要，但生产方法较落后，质量低，成本高，一般合格钢仅占20％左右。重庆大学和这个工厂建立了协作关系，由冶金系负责研究如何提高钢的质量问题，并且帮助工厂改变技术面貌。有的工厂试制新产品缺乏技术力量研究材料的性能、图纸设计等。这些工厂和重庆大学建立了关系，得到了学校的帮助。机械系就帮助重庆度量衡厂分析新产品“弯管气压表”所采用的材料。各系还担负了很多工厂新产品的设计和试制工作。动力系和电机系包干了沙坪坝区各个农业社水电站的设计、安装以及训练技术工人等全套任务。
    目前，重庆大学与各工厂建立的协作项目已有四十多个，各系都开始积极行动起来了。
