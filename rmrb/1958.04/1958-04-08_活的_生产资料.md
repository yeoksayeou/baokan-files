    Living "Means of Production"
    During a session of the Judicial Affairs Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives, a Socialist Party member, feeling that the millions of yen paid to movie stars in their twenties was excessive, raised a question. A politician with ties to the film industry responded cleverly: "Movie stars are also 'means of production,' and it is unavoidable to pay a high price for them."
    More than a century ago, the "Communist Manifesto" pointed out that "The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe," and "has converted personal worth into exchange value." It seems that bourgeois politicians now have no qualms about admitting this.

    活的“生产资料”
    在日本众议院法务委员会上，社会党一位委员认为二十岁左右的电影明星，得到几百万日元的报酬，实在有点太过分，因而提出了质询。同电影界有关系的一名政客回答得很妙：“电影明星也是‘生产资料’，对它们付以高价，是势不得已的。”
    “共产党宣言”在一百多年以前就曾指出：“资产阶级抹去了所有一切素被尊崇景仰的职业上面的神圣光彩”，“它把人的身价变成了交换价值”。看来，资产阶级的政客现在也不讳言这点了。
