The Peaceful "Expedition" of the British People

"For all mankind,
Give us a land of peace!
Let the vile mushroom cloud
Never appear in the future,
We will be proud of this."
—Excerpt from the anthem of the British "Ban the Bomb" march

"For all mankind, give us a land of peace!" For this purpose, the British people who oppose nuclear weapons decided to walk from London to the Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Research Center, 150 *li* away, to express their protest. They decided to complete this journey in four days. The march began on Good Friday.

Trafalgar Square was their gathering place in London. On April 4th, although the sun was shining brightly, the weather was particularly cold, unprecedented in Britain for forty-one years, the number of people participating in the march and those who came to see them off still exceeded the most optimistic estimates. Trafalgar Square was packed, and vehicles could not pass. The people seeing them off continued to increase. The marchers held up signs made of black cloth, which read: "No Missile Bases in Britain!" "Ban the Bomb," "Before the hydrogen bomb buries you, we will bury it first!"

Many marches and demonstrations have been held in Trafalgar Square in the past, but the scene on this day was somewhat different from usual. The most prominent feature was that the marchers were carrying backpacks and camping gear, and some were wearing sheepskin coats and high boots. British women took off their skirts and put on trousers.

This army of five thousand people, excited, happy, and full of confidence, took the first step of their "Long March" at noon.

This is an army of peace, composed of ordinary and kind British people. You can see many middle-aged workers in the march, as well as a large number of young students. Veterans and members of parliament marched side by side. Mr. Baker and his wife marched with their six children, the youngest being just over one year old, sitting in a stroller. In this four-column, six-*li*-long procession, the most eye-catching was the London Dance Troupe. They held up doves of peace and wore dance costumes. When the team rested, they came out to perform for the marchers.

On the first day, most people camped in Hounslow, and some went home to rest. In the evening, the weather turned worse, and heavy snow fell. When they woke up the next day, it was all white, but this could not stop the people marching for peace! They continued to move forward, holding high the banner of "Ban the Bomb." The heavy snow turned into ice and snow, and then into heavy rain. The ground was covered with slush, the clouds were low, and the air was humid and cold. Some of the marchers brought raincoats and umbrellas, but in this situation, their clothes were also soaked. Some people didn't bring anything at all, just ordinary clothes. They took a short rest in Hounslow, drank a few cups of hot tea from the villagers, and then marched forward against the cold wind and rain! This peaceful army, consisting of women, children, the elderly, and young people, stretching for several *li*, sang their battle songs and appeared on the road again!

On the second night, the marching team stayed in Maidenhead.

The newspapers on the second day said that this day was the worst Easter weather in Britain in a century.

Early on the third day, they set off for Reading. The rain stopped. After marching for these two days, their faces were slightly tired, but their spirits were still high. Because they had marched in the rain all day yesterday, some people's feet were swollen today, but they still limped on. Mrs. Ferguson wrapped her feet in tape and marched in sandals. She looked tired, but she was very optimistic. When I asked her what she thought of the march, she smiled and said: "I think our actions are in line with the people's wishes." When talking about the weather the day before, she said: "We passed the test."

Yes, this was indeed a test for them. Many people were participating in such an event for the first time. Some people were walking this far for the first time in their lives, and they usually slept in soft beds at home, but now they had to sleep on the floor!

If you talked to them, you would find that they were people with various political views and religious beliefs, including Communist Party members, Labour Party members, and even ordinary Conservative Party members; there were Christians and Catholics; there were scientists and union leaders. No matter what differences they had in ideology, they had one thing in common, and that was their opposition to atomic war and nuclear weapons. It was in demanding peace that these ordinary people made extraordinary contributions.

This peaceful army was always warmly welcomed by the masses wherever it went. Before arriving in a place, the masses were prepared to greet them. After arriving in a place, many people helped to find campsites and prepare refreshments.

On the fourth day, they were about to arrive in Aldermaston. In fact, the Atomic Weapons Research Center was not in this place, but in the nearby remote wilderness. The marching team continued to move forward, through the wilderness overgrown with weeds and trees, and after passing through a narrow drawbridge, we saw a large area of modern buildings, tall chimneys, surrounded by wire mesh. Other places were still under construction.

Along the way, people joined the march from time to time. Just before arriving in Aldermaston, a team of about seven hundred people from Wessex met with the team from London.

In the few minutes before the marching team arrived at the meeting place, a small car with loudspeakers suddenly drove into the venue. This was to cause trouble. The people waiting there to welcome the peaceful team were very angry, and they drove the car out of the venue in one breath.

The people welcoming them stood on both sides of the road for several *li*. The "Ban the Bomb" march appeared, and applause and cheers were deafening for a while.

After the marching team arrived, the conference began. They received congratulatory telegrams from all over the world. Peace representatives from the United States and West Germany also spoke at the conference. They said that Britain and the United States should follow the example of the Soviet Union and immediately stop nuclear weapons testing; they firmly opposed arming West Germany and demanded that an agreement be reached on disarmament and that atomic weapons be destroyed. The conference finally passed a resolution calling for an immediate halt to the testing, manufacture, and stockpiling of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The conference also decided to send a representative to deliver the resolution to 10 Downing Street and to send it to other relevant national governments.

The British people are very dissatisfied with the British government's atomic arms race policy. This march is just the beginning of an outbreak of discontent hidden in the masses! Li Yichuan

### 英国人民的和平“出征”

    英国人民的和平“出征”
    “为了全人类，
    给我们一块和平的土地吧！
    让极恶的蘑菇形乌云将来不再出现，
    我们将为此而骄傲。”
    ——英国人民“不要氢弹”游行大队歌词中的一段
    “为了全人类，给我们一块和平的土地吧！”反对核武器的英国人民，就是为了这个目的决定从伦敦徒步走到一百五十华里以外的阿尔德马斯顿原子武器研究中心，表示抗议。他们并决定以四天的时间，走完这一段路程。游行是在“耶稣受难日”开始的。
    特拉法加广场是他们在伦敦集合的地点。4月4日这一天，阳光虽然灿烂，而气候却特别寒冷，为英国四十一年来所未有，参加游行和到会欢送的人数还是超过了最乐观的估计。特拉法加广场塞得满满的，车辆都不能通过了，欢送的人们，还在不断地增加。游行人们高举着用黑布制成的标语牌，上面写着“英国不要导弹基地！”“禁止氢弹”“在氢弹还未埋掉你之前，我们先要把它埋葬掉！”
    过去很多游行示威都在特拉法加广场举行，这一天的景象却和往常有些不同。最突出的是游行人们背着背包、露营工具，有的穿着羊皮大衣、长统大靴。英国妇女脱下裙子穿上裤子了。
    五千人组成的这支大军兴奋愉快，信心百倍，于中午踏出了他们“长征”的第一步。
    这是一支和平的大军，组成这支大军的是普普通通善良的英国人民。你可以在游行队伍中看到许多中年工人，也可以看到大量的青年学生。退伍军人与议员并肩前进。培克先生和他的夫人带着他们的六个孩子，最小的一个才一岁多，坐着婴儿车游行。在四路纵队、长达六华里的这支队伍中，最引人注目的是伦敦舞蹈团，他们手举和平鸽，身着舞蹈装。在队伍休息的时候，他们就出来为游行的人表演了。
    第一天，大部分人宿营在汉斯劳，有一些人回家休息了。晚上，天气变得更坏，大雪纷纷落下，第二天起来时，已是到处白雪皑皑，但是这那里能阻止为了和平进军的人们！他们高举着“不要氢弹”的大旗继续前进。大雪变为冰雪，之后又转而为大雨。遍地雪泥，乌云低压，空气潮湿而寒冷。游行的人有的带着雨衣雨伞，但是在这种情况下，衣服也被淋湿了。有些人根本什么都没有带，就是普通的衣服。他们在汉斯劳稍事休息，喝了几杯老乡送来的热茶之后，冒着寒冷的风雨又向前进了！由妇女、儿童、老年人、青年人组成的这支长达数华里的和平大军，唱着他们的战歌，又出现在公路上！
    第二天晚上，游行队伍住在门登海德。
    第二天的报纸说，这一天是一世纪以来英国复活节最坏的天气。
    第三天一早他们向里丁出发了。雨停了。他们经过这两天的行军之后，面容略带倦色，而他们的情绪却仍然很高。由于昨天在雨中行了一天军，今天有些人的脚肿起来，但他们还是一跛一颠地走下去。佛格生夫人，用胶布把脚裹起来，穿着一双凉鞋行军。她看起来虽然很疲倦，但却非常乐观。当我问她对这次游行的看法时，她微笑着说：“我认为我们的行动是合乎人民的希望的。”当谈到前一天的天气的时候，她说：“我们通过了考验。”
    是的，这对他们来说，的确是一个考验。很多人还是第一次参加这样的活动。有的人还是一生第一次走这么远的路，平时在家里睡的是软床，现在要睡地板了！
    如果你和他们攀谈起来，你就会发现，他们是具有各种政治见解和宗教信仰的人，有共产党党员，工党党员，甚至保守党的普通党员；有基督教徒，有天主教徒；有科学家和工会领袖。无论思想意识上有什么分歧，但是他们有一点是共同的，这就是反对原子战争，反对核武器。就是在要求和平这一点上，使这些平凡的人作出了不平凡的贡献。
    这支和平大军每到一个地方，总是受到群众的热烈欢迎。在未到一个地方之前，群众就准备着来迎接他们了。在到一个地方之后，总有许多人帮助找宿营地、准备茶点。
    第四天，他们就要到达阿尔德马斯顿了。其实，原子武器研究中心并不在这个地方，而是在附近的偏僻旷野中。游行大队继续前进，通过野草丛生和树木繁多的旷野，通过一个狭窄的吊桥之后，我们看到了一大片现代建筑物，高大的烟囱，周围有铁丝网。另外一些地方还正在建筑中。
    一路上，时时都有人参加到游行队伍中来。快到阿尔德马斯顿的时候，从威赛克斯来的一支大约有七百人的队伍同从伦敦来的队伍会师了。
    在游行队伍尚未到达开会地点之前的几分钟内，忽然有一辆装着喇叭的小汽车开进了会场。这是来捣乱的。在那里，等候着欢迎和平大队的人们非常气愤，他们一鼓气把这辆小汽车逐出了会场。
    欢迎的人们站在路两边达数里之长。“不要氢弹”游行大队出现了，一时掌声和欢呼声震耳欲聋。
    游行队伍到达之后，大会就开始了。他们接到了世界各地来的贺电。美国和西德的和平代表还在大会上讲了话。他们表示英国、美国应该仿效苏联，立即停止核武器试验；他们坚决反对武装西德并且要求在裁军问题上达成协议、销毁原子武器。大会最后通过要求立即停止试验、制造和储存原子武器和氢武器的决议。大会还决定派代表把这个决议送到唐宁街十号，并分送其他有关国家政府。
    英国人民对于英国政府的原子军备竞赛政策，十分不满。这次游行，不过才是蕴藏在人民群众中不满情绪爆发的一个开始！李一川
