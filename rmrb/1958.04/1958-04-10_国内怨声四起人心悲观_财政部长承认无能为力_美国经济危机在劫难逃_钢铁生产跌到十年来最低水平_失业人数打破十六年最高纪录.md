Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th: Despite the recent series of "anti-recession measures" taken by the U.S. government, the severity of the American economic crisis has only increased. The U.S. government is suffering criticism from all sides.

A United Press reporter wrote on the 7th that the leading government experts he interviewed said that the U.S. government’s "anti-recession" measures "have little or no discernible effect, except perhaps psychologically."

The situation in the market confirms this assertion. In recent days, many news reports have stated that various sectors of the U.S. national economy are constantly setting new recession records. Last week, U.S. steel production fell further than the previous week, dropping to its lowest level in more than a decade. It is generally estimated that it will fall further this week. Last week, the operating rate of U.S. steel mills was only 48.6%, while the operating rate of Detroit steel mills was only 25%, and this week it will be only 10%. In terms of automobile production, March was the month with the lowest output since 1948, and last week it fell nearly 30% compared to the previous week. The overall industrial production index in the last week of March fell to 128, a decrease of 2% from the average index in February, and a decrease of 14% from the production peak in December 1956. According to "U.S. News & World Report," business bankruptcies are also "heading toward the highest level in several years."

The number of unemployed continued to increase in March. The U.S. Department of Labor and the Department of Commerce jointly announced on the 8th that the official number of unemployed people nationwide in March increased by 25,000 compared to February, reaching 5,198,000, creating a 16-and-a-half-year high. The Department of Labor and the Department of Commerce also announced that the number of underemployed workers in March was 2.3 million. This also reached the highest peak since World War II. However, unofficial sources in the United States recently estimated that the number of unemployed people in March increased by 400,000 to 600,000 compared to February.

According to the latest issue of "U.S. News & World Report," the industrial recession has caused the prices of raw materials such as steel, aluminum, tin, wool, and cotton to fall recently. Railway freight volume decreased by 19.2% in the entire first quarter. The inventory in the hands of factories has increased, while wholesalers and retailers have reduced their inventories due to their eagerness to clear goods. Retail businesses are wary of purchasing goods due to poor business. Stock prices fell for nine consecutive days at the end of March and the beginning of April.

These signs indicate that people are pessimistic, and the U.S. government’s "anti-recession measures" have not had much effect even psychologically.

In this situation, voices of blame and complaint are rising across the United States. Some complain that the recent measures taken by the U.S. government, such as expanding public works, are too little, too late. Some complain that these measures are too few and lack weight. Democratic politicians such as Truman are also taking this opportunity to attack the incompetence of the Republican government, attempting to allow the Democratic Party to win in this winter's congressional elections. Powerful groups such as the AFL-CIO, the National Planning Association, and the Council of State Chambers of Commerce are all demanding that the government throw out its last trump card—tax cuts—to prevent the crisis from worsening.

However, the U.S. government sees that if tax cuts are implemented, this year's fiscal deficit will increase by another 7 billion yuan and lead to inflation. It also fears that people will become even more panicked after throwing out this last trump card, and that if it fails, there will be no other solution. Therefore, it is still reluctant to take tax cut measures.

To respond to pressure from all sides, U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson delivered a speech on the 7th. In his speech, Anderson admitted that the government was powerless in the face of the economic crisis brought about by the capitalist system. He said, "In a competitive economy, it can never be guaranteed that there will be no fluctuations." He also said, "The government can only play a secondary role in our economic system." "It is rare for us to be able to find a solution to an economic problem all at once." He said, "Finding the right answer depends on a long and painful process." He promised that the government "will take all actions that can be determined to help promote an early recovery of economic growth," while expressing opposition to hastily taking tax cut measures and scaring people by saying that rushing to take action would be "just playing into the hands of the Russians."

Eisenhower also personally came out on the 8th to issue a statement, spreading an optimistic atmosphere. He attempted to reassure people by saying that the official number of unemployed people in March did not increase much compared to February. In his statement, he said that this figure "shows that employment improved in March and the number of unemployed stabilized. This statistic shows that the recession has slowed down."

However, analysis by the American press has confirmed the falsity of this statement. The United Press pointed out on the 8th that the number of unemployed people in March did not increase too much because the weather turned warmer, and agricultural departments, construction departments, and other outdoor labor began to hire some workers, while the number of unemployed people in industry increased by another 200,000 in this month. Every year, the number of unemployed people nationwide generally decreases by 200,000 from February to March, but this year, not only did it not decrease, but even according to official figures, it increased by 25,000 people.

"New York Post" said on the 3rd that U.S. officials have repeatedly assured that the economy will turn upward in a month or two, "They are very likely preparing a trick for themselves that will scare them to death." The newspaper said, "Most economists now say that April and May (in terms of the number of unemployed) will bring very little change," while "a large increase in the number of unemployed is bound to come in June." The newspaper pointed out that every year at that time, due to the large number of new laborers entering the labor market, the number of unemployed people usually increases significantly. "Last year from May to June, when there was no talk of recession, the official unemployment figures increased from 2.7 million to 3.3 million... (This year at that time) there will be an increase of 1.5 million to 2 million (unemployed people)."

    国内怨声四起人心悲观　财政部长承认无能为力
    美国经济危机在劫难逃
    钢铁生产跌到十年来最低水平　失业人数打破十六年最高纪录
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：尽管美国政府最近接二连三地采取了一些“反衰退措施”，美国经济危机的严重程度有增无已。美国政府备受各方面舆论的责难。
    合众社记者7日报道说，他所访问过的主要的政府专家们都说，美国政府的“反衰退”措施“除了可能在心理上有些作用外，很少有或者没有看得出的影响”。
    市场上的情况证实了这一论断。这几天来，每天都有许多消息报道，美国国民经济各个部门都在不断创造衰退的新纪录。上星期美国钢铁生产比前一星期又进一步下降，跌落到十年多来的最低水平。一般估计本星期还要进一步下降。上星期美国钢铁厂开工率只有48.6％，而底特律的钢铁厂开工率只有25％，本星期甚至将只有10％。在汽车生产方面，3月份成为1948年以来月产量最低的一个月，而上星期又比前一星期下降了近30％。整个工业生产指数在3月的最后一星期中落到一百二十八，比2月份平均指数又降低了2％，比1956年12月的生产最高峰降低了14％。企业的倒闭，据“美国新闻与世界报道”说，也“正在走向几年来的最高水平。”
    失业人数在3月份继续增加。美国劳工部和商务部8日联合宣布，3月份全国失业人数的官方数字比2月份增加了二万五千人，为五百十九万八千人，造成了十六年半来的最高纪录。劳工部和商务部还宣布，3月份半失业工人人数为二百三十万。这也达到第二次世界大战后的最高峰。但是美国非官方人士不久前估计说，3月份失业人数比2月份增加了四十万到六十万。
    据“美国新闻与世界报道”最新一期报道，工业的衰退使钢、铝、锡、羊毛、棉花等原料价格最近都下跌，铁路货运量在整个第一季中减少了19.2％，工厂手中的存货增加了，而批发商和零售商由于急于出清货物手中的存货减少了，零售商业由于生意不佳都对批进货物存有戒心。股票价格在3月底和4月初一连九天下跌。
    这些迹象表明，人心悲观，美国政府的“反衰退措施”甚至在心理上也没有发生多大效果。
    在这种情况下，美国国内对政府责备和埋怨的声音四起。有的埋怨美国政府最近所采取的一些措施如扩大公共工程等远水救不了近火，有的埋怨这些措施太少、没有份量。民主党的政客们如杜鲁门等也乘此机会出来攻击共和党政府无能，企图使民主党在今年冬季的国会选举中获胜。美国劳联—产联、“全国计划协会”、“各州商会委员会”等有力量的团体都要求政府抛出最后一张王牌——减税——来阻止危机更恶化。
    但是，美国政府看到如果实行减税，今年财政赤字就要再增加七十多亿元，并导致通货膨胀，又怕最后这张王牌抛出以后人心更加慌张，而且如果失灵就再没有其他办法了。因此，至今迟迟不愿采取减税措施。
    为了答复来自各方的压力，美国财政部长安德逊7日发表了一篇演说。安德逊在演说中承认，政府面对资本主义制度所带来的经济危机无能为力。他说，“在竞争性的经济中，是永远不能保证没有波动的”。他又说，“政府在我们这种经济制度中只能起二等的作用”，“要我们一下子就能找出解决一个经济问题的办法，这种情况是很少有的”。他说，“找到正确的回答有赖于一个长期的痛苦的过程”。他答应政府“将采取一切可以断定有助于促进早日恢复经济增长的行动”，同时他表示反对匆匆忙忙采取减税的办法，并且吓唬人说：如果匆忙采取行动，就“刚好上了俄国人的当”。
    艾森豪威尔8日也亲自出来发表声明，散布乐观空气。他企图用3月份失业人数官方数字比2月份增加不多来安慰人们。他在声明中说，这个数字“表明3月份就业有起色，失业人数稳定下来。这个统计表明衰退缓慢了”。
    但是美国新闻界的分析却证实了这一说法的虚假。合众社8日指出，3月份失业人数并未有太大的增加是因为天气转暖，农业部门、建筑部门等户外劳动开始雇用一些工人，而工业中失业人数在这个月份内又增加了二十万人，每年3月份全国失业人数一般要比2月份减少二十万，但是今年3月非但没有减少，而且即使按照官方数字也增加了二万五千人。
    “纽约邮报”3日说，美国官方一再保证在一两个月内经济就要转而上升，“他们非常可能是在为他们准备着一个要把自己吓得大吃一惊的把戏”。这家报纸说，“大部分经济学家现在说，4月和5月
  （在失业人数方面）将带来很小变化”而“失业人数的大增在6月里必然要到来”。报纸指出，每年那时候由于大批新劳动力进入劳动力市场，失业人数照例有较大的增长，“去年5月到6月，那时还没有谈论衰退的话，官方的失业数字就从二百七十万增加到了三百三十万……（今年那时候）将有一百五十万到二百万（失业人数）的增加”。
