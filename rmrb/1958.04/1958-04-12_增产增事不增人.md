Increase Production and Tasks, But Not Manpower

The Nanchang Machinery Factory rationally uses apprentices, adjusts labor organization, and learns from advanced experience, extracting a total of 70,000 work hours, equivalent to 100 skilled workers.

(By our reporter) In the Great Leap Forward in production, what should be done if there is insufficient labor? The Nanchang Machinery Factory tapped potential from aspects such as rationally using apprentices, adjusting labor organization, and learning from advanced experience, extracting nearly 70,000 work hours, equivalent to increasing 100 skilled technicians, which can basically solve the labor shortage.

The task of manufacturing agricultural irrigation and drainage equipment accepted by this factory in the first half of this year is equivalent to four times that of the same period last year. According to the factory's original work hour quotas and labor situation, to successfully complete this task, it was estimated that there would be a shortage of more than 70,000 work hours.

After mobilizing the masses to fully air their views, the factory revealed many contradictory phenomena in the use of labor: on the one hand, the factory was shouting about tight tasks and insufficient labor. For example, in the metalworking workshop, as many as 42 lathes were only operating 32 due to a lack of technicians. For a long time, this workshop could not even operate a full shift. However, on the other hand, many senior workers were doing low-level work, and some even frequently did odd jobs. Among the apprentices, who accounted for about half of the total number of technicians in the factory, some had improved their skills rapidly through one or two years of hard study and drilling. When some of them occasionally operated the machines, the work they produced was no worse than that of technicians. Everyone suggested: If the labor organization were rationally adjusted to "make the best use of talents," and at the same time, guidance for apprentices were strengthened, wouldn't this "liberate" a lot of labor? In addition, in learning from and comparing with advanced workers, it was found that some of the work done in this factory could be done with twice the efficiency in the same amount of time in advanced factories. If we could learn from their advanced experience, work hours could be greatly reduced.

After careful study, the factory leadership decided to make reasonable arrangements for labor again, in light of the different situations in each workshop. For example, all the veteran workers in the metalworking workshop were transferred to operate large and medium-sized lathes, freeing up small lathes for second-level and above apprentices to operate. For some work that did not require high precision, they were boldly allowed to do it. For more advanced work, the method of letting apprentices make the rough casting and masters make the finish machining was adopted, reducing the work hours of the masters. This not only enabled all the lathes to be put into operation, but also increased the number of shifts from less than one to two, increasing the annual equipment utilization rate by 25%. The factory also sent some veteran workers to advanced factories in Wuxi and Changzhou to learn from advanced experience. According to their letters, the existing work hour quotas could generally be reduced by more than half.

    增产增事不增人
    南昌机械厂合理使用徒工，调整劳动组织，学习先进经验，共挖出七万个工时，相当于一百名熟练工人。
    本报讯　在生产大跃进中，劳动力不够怎么办？南昌市机械厂从合理使用徒工、调整劳动组织、学习先进经验等方面挖掘潜力，共挖出近七万工时，相当于增加一百名熟练技工，基本上可以解决劳动力不足的困难。
    这个厂今年上半年接受的制造农业排灌设备的任务，即相当于去年同期的四倍。按照该厂原有工时定额和劳动力情况，要胜利完成这一任务，估计尚缺七万多工时。
    这个厂经过发动群众大鸣大放，揭发出在劳动力的使用上存在很多矛盾现象：一方面，厂里叫唤任务紧张，劳动力不足，如金工车间甚至因为技工不够，四十二部车床只开动了三十二部，长时期以来这个车间连一个班次都开不足；可是，另一方面许多高级工却干着低级活，有的甚至经常干杂活。而全厂约占技工总人数二分之一左右的徒工，他们之中有些人经过一两年的苦学苦钻，技术提高很快，有的人偶尔操作时，出的活并不比技工差。大家提出来：如果将劳动组织合理调整一下，作到“人尽其材”，同时，加强对徒工的辅导，这不是可以“解放”出许多劳动力吗？此外，在学先进和比先进中，发现本厂出的某些活，在先进厂花同样时间却可以提高一倍工效，如果好好学习人家的先进经验，工时还可大大压缩。
    经过仔细研究，厂的领导上决定针对各车间不同情况，对劳动力重新作了合理的安排。例如把金工车间的老师傅全部调去操纵大车床和中车床，腾出小车床给二级以上徒工操纵，对一些精密度要求不高的活，大胆放手让他们干；对较高级的活，则采取让徒工车毛胚，师傅车光胚，缩减师傅的工时。不但使全部车床都能开动起来，而且使原来一班都开不足增开到两班，使全年设备利用率提高了25％。这个厂又派出一部分老师傅去无锡、常州等先进厂学习先进经验，据他们写信回来说，现有工时定额一般还可再压缩一半以上。
