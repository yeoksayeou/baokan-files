    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 6th: The Beijing "People's Daily" began wider distribution in Hong Kong on the 4th and has been warmly welcomed by Hong Kong compatriots.
    When this newspaper appeared on newsstands in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon on the morning of the 4th, it quickly sold out. Many readers who could not purchase the newspaper immediately went to bookstores accepting subscriptions to complete subscription procedures.
    According to the person in charge of the New Democracy Publishing House, the distribution agent for the "People's Daily," since the announcement of the expanded distribution of this newspaper in Hong Kong, the number of subscribers has rapidly increased to two thousand, more than double the previous amount. Yesterday, the number of newspapers distributed to newsstands for retail sale was increased extra, but the supply still could not meet the demand. This fully demonstrates the Hong Kong compatriots' love for the motherland and this newspaper.

    本报在港受到热烈欢迎
    据新华社香港6日讯　北京“人民日报”4日在香港扩大发行，受到香港同胞的热烈欢迎。
    当这份报纸4日晨出现在香港九龙各区的报摊上以后，很快就销售一空。许多购买不到这份报纸的读者，马上到接受预订的书店去办理订阅手续。
    据代理发行“人民日报”的新民主出版社负责人说，自从宣布这份报纸在香港扩大发行以来，订户已迅速地增达两千份，比前增加了一倍多。昨天发给各报摊零售的报纸份数已额外增加，但仍是供不应求。这充分表现出香港同胞对祖国和这份报纸的热爱。
