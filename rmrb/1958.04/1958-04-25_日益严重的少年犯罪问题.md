The Increasingly Serious Problem of Juvenile Delinquency

    Judge's Lament

    Judge Philip Gilliam of the Juvenile Court of Denver, USA, recently gave a speech at a state social work conference. He pointed out that the average age of juvenile delinquents in the United States is fifteen. He worriedly said that in ten years, there would be 20 million young people in the United States reaching that age. He asked: "Can we cope with the existing welfare agencies, recreational facilities, police stations, schools, and educational institutions? We simply don't understand the problem of juvenile delinquency… The vast majority of juvenile delinquents are worse than devils!"

        A Small Statistic

    On April 3, the British "Times" published a special article on "Juvenile Delinquency in the United States." The article pointed out that the number of juvenile delinquency cases in the United States has reached 1.5 million per year. In 1956, 66% of car thefts, 54% of burglaries, and 18% of rapes in the United States were committed by juveniles under the age of eighteen. According to statistics published by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, there were a total of 2,563,150 major criminal cases in the United States in 1956. From this small statistic, it is not difficult to see how serious the problem of juvenile delinquency in the United States has become!

      Whose Fault Is This?

    The decadent and declining capitalist society is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency. The head of a juvenile detention center in Maryland, USA, said that the instability of American family life is a major cause of juvenile delinquency. He said that most juvenile delinquents are illegitimate children or young people who do not know who their fathers are. They are raised by grandmothers or relatives in slums, and the average age is fifteen. No one understands them, no one cares about them. They roam the streets and take pleasure in crime.

    The U.S. "Federal Children's Bureau" admits that the Western fighting, vampire, and other horror programs that frequently appear on American television and movies are a factor in the increasing seriousness of juvenile delinquency; the role of terrifying comic strips and crazy rock and roll dances is no less than that of television and movies.

    "New York Times" reporter Salisbury investigated the various juvenile gangs in New York City. He said that almost all juvenile delinquents hate their lives. They feel spiritually depressed, distressed, and have no way out.

    Several New York high school teachers who spoke with Salisbury expressed their views. One teacher said: "Young people are just a reflection of adults and real life." Another teacher said: "We teach children not to be like us. We teach them to be generous, to value the dignity of life, to respect the rights of others. But children have eyes!"

    日益严重的少年犯罪问题
    法官的感叹
    美国丹弗城少年罪犯法庭法官菲利浦·纪廉，最近在一个州的社会事业会议上发表了演说，他指出，美国少年罪犯的平均年龄是十五岁。他并担心地说，十年以后，美国就将有两千万名少年达到这个年龄。他问道：“凭现有的福利机构、娱乐设备、警察局、学校、教育机关，我们对付得了吗？我们根本不懂少年罪犯问题。……绝大多数的少年罪犯比魔鬼还要坏！”
        一个小统计
    4月3日，英国“泰晤士报”发表了“论美国少年罪犯”的专文。这篇文章指出美国少年罪犯的罪案每年已达一百五十万件之多。1956年，美国66％的窃车案、54％的盗窃案和18％的强奸案都是由十八岁以下的少年干的。另据美国联邦调查局所发表的统计数字，1956年美国全国重要犯罪案件共计二百五十六万三千一百五十件。从这个小统计里，不难看出美国少年犯罪问题已经达到了何等严重的程度！
      这是谁的过失？
    腐朽、没落的资本主义社会是少年犯罪的温室。美国马里兰州一个少年罪犯教养所的负责人说，美国家庭生活的不稳定，是少年罪犯产生的一个主要原因。他说，大多数的少年罪犯都是非婚生子、或是一些不知道父亲是谁的少年。他们是由外祖母或亲戚在贫民窟里抚养大的，平均的年龄是十五岁。没有人了解他们，没有人关怀他们。他们流落街头，以犯罪为乐。
    美国“联邦儿童局”承认，美国电视和电影中经常出现的西部武打、吸血鬼等恐怖节目是造成少年犯罪问题日益严重化的一个因素；恐怖的连环图画与令人疯狂的摇摆舞所起的作用，也不下于电视和电影。
    美国“纽约时报”记者萨里斯伯里调查了纽约城形形色色的少年匪党，他说，几乎所有的少年罪犯都厌恶他们的生活。他们感到精神上的压抑、苦闷、没有出路。
    与萨里斯伯里谈过话的几位纽约的中学教师表示了他们的见解。一位教师说：“少年不过是成年人与现实生活的反映。”另一位教师说：“我们教导孩子们不要学我们的样。我们教导他们要慷慨，教导他们重视人生的尊严，教导他们尊重别人的权利。但是孩子们是有眼睛的啊！”　　　　　（乐山）（附图片）
