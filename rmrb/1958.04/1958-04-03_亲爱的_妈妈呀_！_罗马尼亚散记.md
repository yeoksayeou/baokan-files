    Dear "Mamaia"!
    —Sketches of Romania
    Wang Qi
    The Black Sea unveiled the veil of dawn, meeting us with the radiant smile of a mother.

    When the sunlight filled the beach, the laborers recuperating by the sea rushed into the water like children throwing themselves into their mother's arms, chasing the white waves. They jumped and cheered, and no joyous movement could compare to this kind of music!

    I arrived in Constanța—a coastal city in southeastern Romania—and heard a legend about the sea…

    Long ago, Moldavia had a famous national hero who repeatedly defeated the Turkish invaders. Unfortunately, he was wounded in a battle and captured and killed by the Turks. At that time, a chieftain in the Turkish army took a fancy to the national hero's wife and wanted to marry her. This beautiful and kind woman refused to yield, even to death. The chieftain took her and her only daughter to a small Tatar village by the Black Sea, torturing her and forcing her to agree. Filled with sorrow and resentment, she worked with the Tatars. Finally, the chieftain saw that he could not win her heart no matter what, so he resorted to a cruel trick. He put her in a small boat and threw her into the sea. Her little daughter was left alone on the shore. This lonely child watched as her mother was swallowed by the sea, her little eyes fixed on the boat, constantly shouting:

    "Mamaia! Mamaia!"

    The wind roared. The fierce waves grew tighter and tighter. The little girl followed the boat wherever it drifted, reaching out her hands. The boat was almost gone, only a small black dot could be seen, but she kept shouting: "Mamaia!..."

    The sea god was moved by this tragic and weak voice. He ordered the sea water to recede as the little girl walked. The sea water receded until the mother and daughter met again.

    Although the mother and daughter were reunited, they could no longer live. The mother and daughter hugged each other tightly and threw themselves into the sea.

    The sea sighed. The people of the Tatar village were even more grieved! To commemorate this steadfast woman, the Tatars changed the name of the village to "Mamaia" village. From then on, this coast was called "Mamaia" coast.

    This is a touching story that has been passed down to this day. Now, the happy Romanians still speak of this story with a touch of melancholy.

    My longing for the Black Sea was not because I knew this story beforehand; nor was it out of curiosity to see if the Black Sea was black. Not at all. During my visit to Romania, I saw many workers, farmers, and intellectuals who, like the Black Sea, had a history of humiliation and suffering, and their fate was linked to the Black Sea…

    One day, decades ago, by the Black Sea. Young Didus. Stanescu had only slept for three or four hours and dragged his heavy legs out of the door. He stood at the door for a while, his tall figure a stark contrast to the low, sloping hut. He touched his head, what was he thinking about? Was he considering whether to go to sea in such a big storm? No, he didn't have that right! He couldn't remember when he had eaten something, he only felt his head was dizzy and his stomach was burning with hunger. For a moment, a thought floated up: he should eat something. Then he shook his head fiercely, straightened his chest, and walked to the pier without looking back.

    Many years have passed, now who doesn't know Captain Didus Stanescu! He is a nationally known figure, often sailing in storms of nine or ten. He is a petrel accustomed to fighting the waves. The bigger the waves, the more peaceful he is. When a big wave covers him, he jokes and talks as if nothing has happened, his face radiant. This steel-like man understands the suffering of the enslaved people. He has seen with his own eyes the imperialists and the wealthy of his country hand in hand, trampling on their sacred land. When the imperialists wanted to continue to occupy the Suez Canal, he was excited and asked to go to Egypt. Now, he is a pilot on the Suez Canal.

    Thanks to the arrangements of the Romanian comrades, I came to Constanța, near the end of my visit. I came here with such rich impressions of the Romanian people's struggle.

    When I face this incredibly vast Black Sea, I often think of Constantinscu. He spent an unhappy childhood by the Black Sea. Now, he is the chief engineer of a large enterprise in Victory City. He and his partners personally turned an entire mountain into a factory and a city. Those who came from the oil region of Borzești to the Black Sea, perhaps there were Boboci among them. When they excitedly tell others about their latest achievements, they must exude the fragrance of grape blossoms, because grape blossoms are in full bloom next to every oil derrick. Every year when the oil is harvested, the grapes are also harvested. Shabri Amra, the chairman of the "May 8th" collective farm, is a Tatar. In the past, they lived in desolate little villages, and the rulers thought that Tatars were synonymous with poverty, dirt, and backwardness. What are the Tatars like now? The "May 8th" collective farm was the first collectivized village in Black Fort County. This small village by the Black Sea suddenly changed its appearance. The proud Shabri Amra has the intelligence and diligence inherent in their ethnicity. From his black eyes, shone a light of complete belief in his own strength and future, as if to say: "We have everything now; we will have everything in the future."

    I went to the "Mamaia" coast of the Black Sea, and also to the Eforie and Vasile Roaită coasts. Here, there are no dark clouds, no man-eating giant waves, and no poor Tatar villages. Replacing them are peaceful lives, endless joy, and rest homes for laborers everywhere. The beautiful, multi-colored Constanța belongs to the laborers. The light of happiness shines from every window.

    How beautiful is the dusk of the Black Sea! The sun has just set, and the moon rises after dipping in the water. The afterglow of the sunset has not yet dissipated, and the moonlight is so clear. There is not a single cloud, the sky and the earth are the same color, like a vast transparent body.

    The sea, the tranquil sea! Occasionally a breeze blows, and the sea water slowly embraces the beach, making a rustling sound. So slight, yet so sweet! This is the happy sound of calling "Mamaia"!

    亲爱的“妈妈呀”！
    ——罗马尼亚散记
    汪琦
    黑海揭开了清晨的面纱，带着母亲的灿烂的笑容，同我们会见了。
    当阳光照满沙滩的时候，在海边休养的劳动者，像孩子投向母亲的怀抱，一个个跑到海水中去，追逐着白色的浪花，他们跳跃着，欢呼着，任何快乐的乐章，也不能同这种音乐相比！
    我到了康斯坦萨——罗马尼亚东南方的一个沿海的城市，听到了关于海的传说……
    在很久以前，摩尔多瓦亚有一个出名的民族英雄，屡次抗击土耳其人的侵略，都得到了胜利。不幸在一次战斗中负伤，被土耳其人抓去杀害了。当时土耳其军队里有一个头目，看中了这位民族英雄的妻子，要想娶她，这个美丽而善良的妇人，宁死也不屈从，那个头目把她和她的唯一的女儿，带到黑海边一个鞑靼人的小村子里，折磨她，逼她答允。她带着无比的忧伤和愤恨，同鞑靼人一起劳动，最后，那个头目看到无论如何也得不到她的心，下了毒手，把她装在一只小船里抛到大海中去。她的小女儿独自一人留在岸上，这个孤苦伶仃的孩子，看见她的妈妈将被海水吞没了，她的小眼睛一直盯着那只小船，嘴里不断喊着：
    “妈妈呀！妈妈呀！”
    风，怒吼着。凶恶的海浪一阵比一阵紧。小船漂到那里，小姑娘张着手跟到那里。小船快没有了，只能看到一个小黑点，她还一直呼喊：“妈妈呀！……”
    海神被这个凄惨而幼弱的声音感动了。他命令海水：小姑娘走到那里，海水就向后退。海水一直退到母女二人又相见的地方。
    虽然母女相逢了，可是再也不能生活下去了。母女紧紧地抱在一起投了海。
    海，叹息着。鞑靼村的人更悲痛！为了纪念这个坚贞的女性，鞑靼人把这个村子改为“妈妈呀”村，从此，这个海岸就叫做“妈妈呀”海岸。
    这是一个感人的故事，它一直流传到今天。现在，幸福的罗马尼亚人谈起这个故事来，还带着淡淡的哀愁。
    我向往黑海，并不是我预先知道这个故事；也不是好奇，想看看黑海是不是黑色的，全不是。当我在罗马尼亚访问的时候，我看见了许许多多的工人、农民和知识分子，他们都像黑海一样，有一段屈辱的、痛苦的历史，他们的命运同黑海是关连着的……
    几十年前的一天，在黑海边。年轻的狄都斯。斯德耐斯古刚睡过三、四小时，又拖着沉重的双腿走出了门。他在门口站了一会儿，他的高大的身躯同那低斜的小屋成了鲜明的对比。他摸摸脑袋，他在考虑什么呢？他是考虑这样大的风暴要不要到海上去吗？不是，他没有这样的权利！他记不起什么时候吃过东西，他只觉得脑袋昏沉，腹内饥火燃烧。有一忽儿，一个念头浮起来了：应当吃点什么。随即他狠狠地摇摇头，挺起胸脯，头也不回地向码头走去了。
    许多年过去了，现在谁不知道老船长狄都斯·斯德耐斯古呢！他是全国闻名的人物，他经常在九、十级风暴中航海。他是一个惯于同海浪搏斗的海燕，浪越大，他越安详。一个大浪盖过来了，他像什么也没有发生过似的谈笑自若，容光焕发。这个钢铁一般的人，他懂得被奴役的人民的痛苦，他亲眼看见帝国主义者和本国的富豪手牵着手，践踏他们神圣的土地。当帝国主义者想依旧侵占苏伊士运河的时候，他激动了，要求到埃及去。现在，他是苏伊士运河上的领航员了。
    感谢罗马尼亚的同志的安排，我来到康斯坦萨，已是访问将近结束的时候，我带着那样瑰丽的罗马尼亚人民斗争的丰富印象，来到这里。
    当我面对着这无比广阔的黑海的时候，我常常想到康斯坦丁斯古。他在黑海边挨过了不幸的童年。现在，他是胜利城一个大企业的总工程师。他和他的伙伴们亲手把整整一座大山变成了工厂和城市。那从博尔台希的油区来到黑海边的人，其中也许有博博契吧。当他们兴奋地把他们的最新成就告诉别人的时候，他们身上一定会散发出那样芬芳的葡萄花的香味，因为在他们每一个油井架旁边，都开满了葡萄花。每年石油丰收了，葡萄也丰收了。“五月八日”集体农庄主席沙勃利·爱姆拉，是鞑靼族人，过去他们住在荒凉的小村里，统治者认为鞑靼人就是贫穷、肮脏、落后的同义词。如今的鞑靼人是怎样呢？“五月八日”集体农庄是黑伏特县第一个集体化的村庄。这个黑海边的小村庄，顿时变了样。自豪的沙勃利·爱姆拉，他有着他们民族所特有的那种聪明和勤劳的本能。从他的黑色眼睛里，射出了完全相信自己力量和未来的光芒，好像在说：“现在的一切，我们都有了；将来的一切，我们也会有的。”
    我到了黑海“妈妈呀”海岸，也到了爱福利安和瓦亚立洛阿德海岸。这里，没有阴云，没有吞噬人的巨浪，没有贫穷的鞑靼村。代替它们的，是和平的生活，是不尽的欢乐，到处是劳动者的休养所。美丽的、多色彩的康斯坦萨，是属于劳动者的。幸福的光亮，从每一个窗户里射出来。
    黑海的黄昏，是多么美好啊！太阳刚刚落下去，月亮在水里浸了一浸升上来了，落日的余辉还未散尽，月色又如此皎洁起来。没有一片云彩，天地一色，像一个广大的透明体。
    海，宁静的海！间或有一阵微风吹过，海水慢慢地拥上沙滩，发出沙沙的声音。这样轻微，又这样甜蜜！这是呼唤“妈妈呀”的幸福的声音啊！
