    Striving Towards World Level
    ——A Review of the National Twenty-Five Unit Weightlifting Championships
    Cao Di
    The 1958 National Twenty-Five Unit Weightlifting Championships has successfully concluded. This competition yielded great gains, reviewing our weightlifting strength and greatly promoting the widespread development of weightlifting in the future. Less than half a year has passed since the last National Weightlifting Championships. In this short period, our weightlifting athletes, through diligent study and hard training, have achieved many encouraging results in this competition. During the six-day competition, a total of ten people broke the national records created last year in eleven individual events and two total scores nineteen times. The heavyweight division, the weakest of China's seven weightlifting categories, saw eight new records set. The famous weightlifter Huang Qianghui created a world-best record of 155 kilograms in the clean and jerk in the lightweight division. Moreover, the athletes' scores generally improved. According to incomplete statistics, more than 50% of the athletes broke their own past records in this competition. In some events, unprecedented fierce competition emerged. Take the heavyweight division as an example, where past performance was the worst and there were few athletes. For three years, Chang Guanqun of the Shanghai team has maintained the absolute championship. But this time the situation was different. Han Laixiang and Wang Fuman of the "August 1st" team broke the national records held by Chang Guanqun in the snatch and clean and jerk, respectively.
    The emergence of a large number of new forces is a feature of this competition. According to incomplete statistics, more than 50% of the 238 athletes are participating in national competitions for the first time. They are novices who have been practicing weightlifting for only one or two years, but they have good physical conditions, work hard, and are ambitious, making amazing progress. This means that China's young weightlifting movement is like the rising sun, with infinitely bright prospects. The nineteen-year-old athlete Qiu Rongshan only started practicing weightlifting in July last year. In the National Weightlifting Championships in October last year, he won the third place in the middleweight competition with a total score of 347.5 kilograms. In this middleweight competition, he broke the national record with a press of 118 kilograms and won the championship with a total score of 357.5 kilograms. There are also many young athletes in their teens who have not been practicing weightlifting for long. Although they did not achieve good rankings this time, judging from their body shape and skills, they are likely to become weightlifting experts in the future.
    From the composition of the athletes participating in this competition, the largest proportion is employees of industrial, mining, transportation, and other enterprises. According to incomplete statistics of 185 athletes, the number of employees accounted for 60%. This is the result of China's vigorous development of mass sports. The hard-working Chinese employee weightlifters performed excellently in this competition. Among the fourteen members of the Shanghai team, which won the team championship, eleven were employees of enterprises. Xu Honglin, a shop assistant worker from Nanjing who broke the national record of 330 kilograms created by Chen Jingkai last year in the featherweight division with a total score of 332.5 kilograms in this featherweight competition. These situations show that only in a socialist country can workers' sports develop so universally and vigorously.
    It can be seen from this competition that weightlifting athletes have improved in mastering techniques. In the past, due to shortcomings in training, some athletes were often seen in competitions who had not yet mastered the basic techniques of weightlifting. In this competition, the phenomenon of using body backward bending to complete the action during the press, thus causing fouls, was much less than in the past. Many athletes have mastered the snatch technique well. They generate good force, have fast speed, and can keep the barbell rising in a straight line. The action of pulling the barbell to the chest, which is very important in the clean and jerk, has also improved. The mastery of weightlifting techniques is also a very important factor in the good results this time. This competition also exposed some problems. The most important is that, including some excellent athletes, generally, they are good at the clean and jerk but poor at the press and snatch. Balanced development and equal emphasis on the three lifts is something that should be paid attention to in future training. For example, in the past, some athletes only paid attention to skill training and ignored strength training when practicing the press, and this situation should also be changed. At present, China's weightlifting level has jumped to the third in the world, holding two world records. From this competition, we see that our weightlifting team is strong. It is hoped that weightlifting athletes will make another effort to push China's weightlifting level to the world peak.

    向世界水平挺进
    ——评全国二十五单位举重锦标赛
    曹弟
    1958年全国二十五单位举重锦标赛胜利闭幕了。这次比赛的收获很大，通过比赛检阅了我们的举重力量，同时对今后普遍开展举重运动起了很大的推动作用。从去年全国举重锦标赛到现在还不到半年，在这短短的半年中，我们的举重运动员经过勤学苦练，在这次比赛中创造了许多令人欢欣鼓舞的优秀成绩。在六天比赛中，先后共有十人十九次刷新了去年创造的十一个单项和两个总成绩的全国纪录。我国举重运动七个级别中最弱的重量级，这次共创造了八个人次的新纪录。著名举重运动健将黄强辉创造了轻量级双手挺举一百五十五公斤的世界最高纪录。不仅如此，运动员的成绩普遍提高。据不完全统计，有50％以上的运动员在这次比赛中刷新了自己过去的纪录。有的项目比赛，还出现了前所未有的剧烈竞争情况。就如重量级，过去的成绩最差，运动员也很少。三年来，上海队常冠群一直保持绝对冠军。而这次情况就不同了，“八一”队的韩来祥和王富满分别打破了常冠群保持的抓举和挺举的全国纪录。
    人材辈出，大批新生力量的涌现是这次比赛的一个特点。据不完全统计，在二百三十八名运动员中有50％以上的运动员是第一次参加全国性的比赛，练习举重也不过一二年的新手，但身体条件好，锻炼刻苦，雄心勃勃，进步惊人。这意味着我国年轻的举重运动正如旭日东升，有着无限美好的前景。十九岁的运动员丘荣山，去年7月才开始练习举重，去年10月全国举重锦标赛时，以三百四十七点五公斤的总成绩获得中量级比赛的第三名。他在这次参加中量级比赛中，以推举一百一十八公斤打破了全国纪录。并以三百五十七点五公斤的总成绩荣获冠军。还有不少练习举重不久，十几岁的年轻的运动员，这次虽然没有取得好的名次，但从他们的体形、技巧等方面看，将来都有希望成为举重好手。
    从参加这次比赛的运动员的成份来看，比例占最大的是工矿交通等企业部门的职工。据一百八十五名运动员的不完全统计，职工的人数占60％。这是我国大力开展群众性体育运动的结果。勤学苦练的我国职工举重运动员，在这次比赛中表现了优异的成绩，荣获这次比赛团体冠军的上海队的十四名队员中，企业部门职工就占了十一名。这次的次轻量级比赛中，以总成绩三百三十二点五公斤打破去年陈镜开创造的次轻量级三百三十公斤全国纪录的徐鸿林，就是南京市一个商店的店员工人。这些情况说明了只有在社会主义的国家里，工人的体育运动才能这样普遍地蓬勃发展。
    从这次比赛中可以看出，举重运动员们在掌握技术方面有了提高。过去，由于训练工作有缺点，在比赛中经常看到一些运动员还没有很好地掌握举重的基本技术。而这次比赛中，在推举时，利用身体后塌来完成动作，因而造成犯规的现象比过去少多了。很多运动员的抓举技术掌握的都不坏。发力好，速度快，并能做到杠铃直线上升。在挺举方面很重要的提铃到胸的动作也都有进步。举重技术的掌握，也是这次成绩好的一个很重要的因素。这次比赛也暴露出一些问题。最主要的就是：包括一些优秀的运动员在内，一般的都是挺举好，推举和抓举差。平均发展，三举并重，这是今后训练中应该注意的问题。再如，过去有些运动员练习推举时，只注意技巧的训练而忽略了力量的训练，这个情况也是应该改变的。目前，我国举重运动水平已跃居世界第三，占有两个世界纪录。从这次比赛看到我们的举重队伍是实力雄厚的。希望举重运动员再努一把力，把我国举重水平向世界顶峰再推进一步。
