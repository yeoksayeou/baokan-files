    Place Names Should Be More Detailed
    The People's Daily published an article on April 12 entitled "Proficient in Politics, Proficient in Production, Proficient in Business," introducing the financial and trade work of Qin County. Where is Qin County? Which province does it belong to? I couldn't find it after reading the entire article. In the editor's note, it only stated that this was the work summary of the Qin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, without mentioning which province. I hope that when publishing similar articles in the future, it is best to write the place names in more detail so that readers engaged in similar work can write to contact them to learn from their experiences.

    地名要写得详细些
    4月12日人民日报发表一篇题为“通政治、通生产、通业务”，介绍沁县财贸工作的文章，沁县在哪里呢？属于哪一省呢？看遍了全文都找不出。编者按语中，也只说明这是中共沁县县委会的工作总结，没有说明那一省。我希望今后发表类似这样的文章，最好把地名写详细一点，以便搞同类工作的读者，去信联系学习经验。
