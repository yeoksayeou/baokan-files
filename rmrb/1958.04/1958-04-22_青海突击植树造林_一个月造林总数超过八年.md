Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 21st - By the 15th, ten counties and cities in the agricultural area of Qinghai Province had afforested more than 750,000 mu, exceeding the total afforestation in the past eight years by more than 220,000 mu.

Since mid-to-late March, the province has adopted a crash program for afforestation. The advantage of doing so is that it is short in duration and yields great results. Minhe County mobilized half of the county's labor force and afforested 200,000 mu in a concentrated effort from the 1st to the 8th, completing 66.6% of the annual plan. The Huzhu Tu Autonomous County extracted 60% of its labor force for a concentrated afforestation effort. Along the Yellow River and Huangshui River, the Xunhua Salar Autonomous County, Hualong Hui Autonomous County, and eight other counties, including Minhe and Ledu, formed afforestation armies with young people as the backbone, and are currently enthusiastically building the "Communist Youth League Thousand-Li Forest Belt along the Yellow River" and the "Five Hundred-Li Protective Forest along the Huangshui River."

    青海突击植树造林
    一个月造林总数超过八年
    据新华社西宁21日电　青海省农业区十个县市到15日已经造林七十五万多亩，比八年来造林的总数还多二十二万多亩。
    从3月中下旬起，这个省就采取突击方式植树造林。这样做的好处是时间短，收效大。民和县动员全县一半劳动力，在1日到8日突击造林二十万亩，完成全年计划66.6％。互助土族自治县抽出60％的劳动力突击造林。黄河、湟水两岸的循化撒拉族自治县、化隆回族自治县和民和、乐都等八个县以青年为骨干组成了造林大军，目前正在热烈地营造“共青团黄河千里林带”和“湟水五百里防护林”。（附图片）
