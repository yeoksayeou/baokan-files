Nanjing, April 3rd (by our own reporter) - Commercial departments in the Yancheng Special District of Jiangsu Province are making every effort to tap local sources of goods, overcoming difficulties in the insufficient supply of certain agricultural production materials. The total value of production materials supplied by the special district's supply and marketing cooperative this year is expected to reach more than 2.6 million yuan, exceeding the original plan by 28%. It is estimated that this will basically meet the needs of agricultural production.

The Chenliang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Funing County has purchased more than 469,000 catties of scrap iron and a large amount of old wood locally, which has been supplied to handicraft cooperatives to manufacture a large number of plowshares, iron shovels, iron nails, etc., for timely supply to farmers.

    就地发掘货源　满足农业需要
    本报南京3日电　江苏省盐城专区商业部门千方百计发掘地方货源，克服了某些农业生产资料货源不足的困难。专区供销社今年供应的生产资料总值可达二百六十多万元，超过原订计划28％，据估计，基本上能满足农业生产的需要。
    阜宁县陈良供销社在当地收购了四十六万九千多斤废铁和许多旧木料，供给手工业社制造出大批犁头、铁锹、铁钉等，及时供应给农民。
