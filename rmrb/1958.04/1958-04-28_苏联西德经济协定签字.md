Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 26th -- According to TASS, the economic and trade agreement and consular treaty between the Soviet Union and West Germany were formally signed in Bonn on the 25th. The draft of these two documents was already signed in Moscow earlier this month.

Representing the Soviet Union in signing the economic and trade agreement were First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Mikoyan and Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Kumykin; signing the consular treaty were Mikoyan and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Semyonov.

Representing West Germany in signing the aforementioned documents were West German Foreign Minister von Brentano, etc.

After the signing of the agreement, Mikoyan and von Brentano spoke successively.

Mikoyan pointed out that the signing of the economic and trade agreement and consular treaty between the two countries is another significant step in the relationship between the Soviet Union and West Germany after the establishment of diplomatic relations, and it also has considerable significance for the easing of international tensions, which the Soviet government has consistently and unswervingly strived for.

Mikoyan said that the situation in Europe as a whole largely depends on the relationship between the Soviet Union and West Germany, and on whether they can find a path of trust and cooperation. He pointed out that nothing can bring the people of all countries closer than peaceful cooperation in the economic field, and that such economic cooperation is a reliable foundation for improving political relations between countries.

Mikoyan emphasized that the Soviet Union will do everything possible to satisfactorily implement the agreements reached and will promote the vigorous development of economic relations between our two countries.

West German Foreign Minister von Brentano then spoke. He emphasized that the signing of the agreement resolved important issues in the relations between the two countries. He called this a fact of great significance, saying that we have therefore taken a big step forward.
