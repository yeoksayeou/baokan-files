Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 3rd — Haining County, Zhejiang Province, has established fifty-two private agricultural middle schools, ensuring that every township has one.

　　On March 25th, Yongfu Township in Haining County took the lead in establishing a private agricultural middle school. The Haining County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly convened an on-site meeting in this township, sparking a widespread enthusiasm for establishing schools. The secretaries of the CCP organizations in all twenty-eight townships and towns in the county took action themselves, and after several days of hard work, they finally established fifty-two private agricultural middle schools. Two thousand nine hundred higher primary school graduates and young farmers with equivalent cultural levels participated in the studies.

　　The school buildings, teachers, and other issues for these private middle schools are basically being resolved by the masses themselves. In many places, students are repairing classrooms and building desks and chairs themselves, and some people are even giving up their houses to run schools. These schools all offer five courses: Chinese language, arithmetic (abacus, financial accounting), basic agricultural knowledge, politics, and basic health knowledge. The teachers are cadres transferred to lower levels, primary school teachers, and high school graduates participating in production, all of whom possess a high school cultural level.

　　The establishment of private agricultural middle schools has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of farmers. A member of the Qin Hai Cooperative in Dingqiao Township said: "The Communist Party is so thoughtful, bringing middle school to our doorstep." All the students of the Liangcang Township Agricultural Middle School presented a letter of determination to the township general branch, proposing to "study for half a day to equal a full day, and produce for half a day to equal full work." They are prepared to arrive at school early in the morning for extra classes and return home late in the afternoon to do more production. (Attached picture)

    海宁县乡乡有中学
    新华社杭州3日电　浙江省海宁县已创办了五十二所民办农业中学，做到了乡乡有中学。
    3月25日海宁县永福乡首先创办了一所民办农业中学。中共海宁县委及时地在这个乡召开了现场会议，掀起了普遍办学的热潮。全县二十八个乡、镇的中共党组织的书记都自己动手，经过几天的艰苦奋斗，终于兴办了五十二所民办农业中学。全县二千九百名高小毕业生和相当于高小文化水平的青年农民参加了学习。
    这些民办中学的校舍、师资等问题，基本上是依靠群众自己解决的。很多地方的学生自己修理教室、自己钉课桌课椅，有的群众把自己的房子也让出来办学。这些学校中都设置了语文、算术（珠算、财务会计）、农业常识、政治、卫生常识等五门课程。担任教师的是具有高中文化水平的下放干部、小学教师和参加生产的高中毕业生。
    民办农业中学的设立，受到广大农民的热烈欢迎。该县丁桥乡勤海社社员说：“共产党想得真周到，中学办到我们门口来了。”两仓乡农业中学全体学生向乡总支呈献了决心书，提出了要“半天读书抵一天，半天生产抵全工”，他们准备早上提早到校多上课，下午晚回家多生产。（附图片）
