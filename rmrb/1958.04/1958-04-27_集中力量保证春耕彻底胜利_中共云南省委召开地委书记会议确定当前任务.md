Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 26th. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) recently held a meeting of prefectural party secretaries, which concluded that: we are now facing a decisive moment for achieving a leap forward in production this year. The task of the Party is to continue to uphold and promote enthusiasm, grasp measures firmly, adjust the rhythm, mobilize and lead the people of all ethnic groups in the province to forge ahead courageously, and ensure a complete victory in spring planting.

According to inspections and reports from various localities, the great leap forward in production since last winter is developing healthily. Water conservancy has completed the task of irrigating an additional 10 million mu, equivalent to doubling the original water conservancy area in the province. There are still more than 2.4 million people continuing to work hard on construction sites. Fertilizer has been accumulated to 2.7 billion jin in stable manure equivalent, exceeding the original plan by 70%, and is continuing to increase. Local industry has newly built more than 600 factories and mines and put them into production one after another. Other work is also advancing rapidly. The enthusiasm of cadres and the masses continues to be high, and the situation is vibrant. The decisive battle at present is spring planting, and the key to the development of local industry also lies in the second quarter. In the mass leap forward, it is inevitable to make adjustments to certain links to ensure the victory of spring planting. The focus of leadership should immediately shift to spring planting.

The meeting considered that: on the water conservancy construction sites, the projects should be ranked immediately. Those that can be completed before the spring planting must be completed in a concentrated effort. Those that require long-term construction should be organized to persevere. New projects should generally no longer be launched in order to free up forces to invest in spring planting and to carry out comprehensive planning for water conservancy construction for the next year as soon as possible. The quality of existing water conservancy projects should be checked, defects should be remedied, and an acceptance system should be established. According to the original plan, spring planting should strive to be two solar terms ahead of schedule, but according to weather forecasts, rainfall may be delayed by two solar terms. Drought resistance has become the most acute struggle in spring planting. Therefore, every effort should be made to store water, accumulate water, block water, lift water, and save water to ensure transplanting. The meeting pointed out that the provincial average fertilizer application is only 68 dan per mu. It is necessary to adopt a method of hard work and concentrated effort to ensure that the application of fertilizer for spring crops reaches 4 billion dan in stable manure equivalent. It is also necessary to grasp the rapid composting of fertilizer, quickly send fertilizer to the fields by improving transportation conditions, and apply fertilizer reasonably by watching the fields, watching the seedlings, and watching the time. In order to improve the soil and change the red soil and many barren soils in Yunnan, soil surveys should be conducted and "soil archives" should be established separately, and efforts should be made to complete the plan of converting paddy fields and terraced fields. On the basis of great leaps forward in soil, water, fertilizer, and many technical measures, and on the basis of the continued high revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of cadres and the masses, we are confident of winning a complete victory in the spring planting battle. In order to ensure increased production in newly converted paddy fields and terraced fields, three measures must be adhered to: deep plowing of more than six cun, preservation of surface fertile soil, and application of more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer.

The meeting emphasized that the hope for increased production should be placed on every specific measure at hand, and the overall situation should not be affected by the negligence of one link. It is necessary to combine the battle deployment with specific battles. Therefore, in addition to the preparatory work for spring planting such as water conservancy, fertilizer, and soil, we must grasp the measures step by step, from seed selection and seedling raising to changes in the farming system. Efforts should be made to overfulfill every link. Therefore, from the county to the commune, it is necessary to implement division of labor and responsibility, evaluation, and inspection according to crops and measures, and strengthen the management system of cooperatives to ensure the implementation of measures, implement contracting tasks to teams, and contract varieties, yields, fertilizers, time, work points, etc. to the fields, and assign field management inspection responsibilities to households.

The meeting considered that the current rural labor demand is one or two times higher than in previous years. The fundamental way to liberate the current rural labor shortage is through technological innovation. The first is the improvement of tools by the vast majority of the masses. The meeting proposed that in areas with slower progress in technical reforms in plains and semi-mountainous areas, efforts should be made to achieve improved tools and basically eliminate human carrying by the end of May. Counties and townships that have initially achieved the use of vehicles and rail to improve tools instead of human carrying should immediately summarize their experiences and take a step forward. Farmers should make soil machinery, and specialized and county local industries should strive to supply and trial-produce semi-mechanical products. Large factories should manufacture large-scale machinery, so that the three are combined to promote the technical revolution in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. The meeting decided to immediately establish technical reform guidance committees at all levels to summarize experiences and promote advanced technologies. The meeting affirmed the experience of some counties in setting up full-time personnel to study local experience and develop exhibitions to introduce improved tools, and demanded that all counties widely promote it. The meeting considered that the great leap forward has promoted the learning of cadres, and learning will promote the great leap forward. The meeting required rural cadres at all levels to initially remove their blindness to soil, fertilizer, plants, and plant diseases and insect pests this year, liberate themselves from the status of slaves, and become masters of the above four aspects. Therefore, the meeting also stipulated the learning plan for cadres in politics and business.

    集中力量保证春耕彻底胜利
    中共云南省委召开地委书记会议确定当前任务
    新华社昆明26日电　中共云南省委最近召开的地委书记会议认为：现在已经面临实现今年生产跃进的决定性的时刻，党的任务就在于继续坚持和发扬干劲，抓紧措施，调整节奏，动员和带领全省各族人民奋勇前进，保证春耕生产的彻底胜利。
    根据检查和各地的汇报说明：从去冬以来的生产大跃进正在健康发展，水利已完成增灌一千万亩，相当于全省原有水利面积的一倍；目前还有二百四十多万人在工地上继续坚持苦战；肥料已积贮折合厩肥二十七亿斤；超过原计划70％，而且还继续增加；地方工业已新建六百多个厂矿并先后投入生产，其它工作也在迅速前进；干部和群众情绪持续高涨，形势生气蓬勃。目前决定性的一战是春耕生产，地方工业发展的关键，也在第二季度。在群众性大跃进中，必然需要对某些环节予以调整，以保证春耕生产胜利。领导的重点，要立即转到春耕生产上来。
    会议认为：目前在水利工地上，应立即进行工程排队，凡春耕前可能完工的，必需突击完成，需要长年施工的，应组织力量坚持；新的工程一般不再铺开，以便腾出力量投入春耕，和及早地进行下一年度水利建设的全面规划；对已有的水利工程，应进行质量检查，有缺点应予补救，建立验收制度。依照原定计划，春耕栽种要争取提前两个节令，但是，据气象预报，雨水又可能迟来两个节令。抗旱已经成为春耕生产的最尖锐的斗争，因此，应千方百计蓄水、积水、堵水、提水和节约用水，保证栽插。会议指出：全省肥料平均每亩还只有六十八挑，必需采取苦战突击的办法，务使大春用肥达到折合厩肥四十亿挑；并且抓紧速效堆肥，通过改进运输条件，迅速送肥上田，看田、看苗、看时合理施肥；为了改良土壤，改变云南的红壤和许多瘦土，应该进行土壤调查，分别建立“土壤档案”，努力完成改水田、改梯田梯地的计划。在土、水、肥和许多技术措施大为跃进的基础上，在干部和群众的革命干劲和创造性继续高涨的基础上，争取春耕战斗的完全胜利是有信心的。为了保证新改的水田梯田增产，必须坚持三项措施：深耕六寸以上，保存表面肥土，施肥万斤以上。
    会议强调指出：要把增产的希望寄托在当前的每一步具体措施上，不要因一个环节的疏忽而影响全局，必需把战役部署和具体战斗结合，因此，除水利、肥料、土壤等春耕的准备工作而外，对选种、育苗到耕作制度的改变，都要步步抓紧措施。应力争每一环节都超额完成，因此，从县到社，要按作物，按措施实行分工负责，评比检查；并加强合作社的管理制度，保证措施实现，实行包工包产包财务到队，品种、产量、肥料、时间、工分等包到田；田间管理检查责任到户等办法。
    会议认为：目前农村需要的劳动力比往年增加一两倍，解放目前农村劳动力紧张的根本出路在技术革新。首先是千百万群众的改进工具。会议提出在平坝和半山区技术改革进展较迟的地区，争取在五月底前实现改良工具，基本消灭人挑人背；现已初步实现用车子、轨道改良工具代替人挑人背的县和乡，要立即总结经验，提高一步。农民做土机械，专、县地方工业努力供应和试制半机械产品，大厂应制造大型机械，使三者相结合，达到多快好省地促进技术革命。会议决定立即成立各级的技术改革指导委员会，总结经验，推广先进。会议肯定了若干县内设立专人结合实践学习外地经验和开展览会介绍改良工具的经验，要求所有的县都广泛推行。会议认为：大跃进中促进了干部的学习，学习又将促进大跃进，会议要求各级农村干部在今年内初步解除对土壤、肥料、植物、病虫害的盲目状态。从奴隶地位中解放出来，成为上述四个方面的主人，因此，会议还规定了干部政治与业务的学习规划。
