The Benefits of "Sixteen Looks" are Many
He Zhuo

After reading the report on Zhangpu County establishing sixteen clear banners, everyone will see that the "Sixteen Looks" proposed by the county party committee is a very good leadership method – a method of using models, educating the masses, and promoting work.

Its first benefit is: using models from all aspects to further eliminate conservative thinking and consolidate advanced thinking. After setting the targets, has everyone's conservative thinking been eliminated? No. Are all those with advanced thinking very confident in completing the advanced targets? Also, no. Even the ten fingers have different lengths! Therefore, we must continue to find ways to eliminate conservative thinking. With this "Sixteen Looks" method, that is easy to handle. If you still can't figure something out, you can be asked to look at something, using living facts to prove that this is not a fantasy, but a reality.

The second benefit is: it can summarize the experience of the masses and disseminate specific practices. In many places, there are advanced targets, but not necessarily specific measures; or there are specific measures for one task, but not for another; or although there are specific measures, they are not advanced or not completely advanced. And if there are no advanced measures, the advanced targets will often fall through. The proposal of "Sixteen Looks" enables the broad masses to visit and learn from these advanced models, which will not only enhance confidence but also learn methods, so that those who cannot formulate measures can also formulate measures; those whose measures are not specific can make them specific, and those whose measures are not advanced can make them advanced. This can ensure the reliable realization of the leap forward targets.

The third benefit is: the method of "Sixteen Looks" also solves the problem of methods for organizing and mobilizing the masses. Everyone knows that measures also need people to implement them. There are different ways to mobilize and organize manpower, one is to use coercion and orders, and the other is to use persuasion and education, and presenting facts and reasoning is the most powerful method of persuasion and education. The reason why the experience of Dabu Township is particularly valued and promoted throughout the county is also here.

The fourth benefit: with so many models, the leadership comrades also have more methods: the work of raising pigs and penning pigs has the experience of Luoxi Township to refer to; the work of improving soil has the experience of Yingshan Township to refer to; the work of afforestation and forest protection has the experience of Qingguo Township to refer to. This is a true method of coming from the masses and going to the masses. As long as we earnestly implement this line and learn this method, the leadership level will be greatly improved, and the work will be greatly developed.

The "Sixteen Looks" method of Zhangpu County is a comprehensive leadership method and deserves to be greatly promoted. This certainly does not mean that every region should have a "Sixteen Looks," but rather that we should learn from Zhangpu County and achieve "everyone grasps models, everything has an example, and every item has a demonstration."

### “十六看”的好处多

    “十六看”的好处多
    何卓
    读了漳浦县树立十六面鲜明旗帜的报道以后，人人都会看出，这个县委所提出的“十六看”是一个很好的领导方法——运用典型、教育群众、推动工作的方法。
    它的第一个好处是：运用各方面的典型，进一步消除保守思想，巩固先进思想。在订出指标之后，是不是所有人的保守思想都消除了呢？不是。是不是所有有先进思想的人，对于完成先进指标都很有把握了呢？也不是。十个指头还有个长短呢！因此还要继续设法消除保守思想。有了这个“十六看”的方法，那就好办了。你对什么还想不通，就可以请你去看什么，用活生生的事实来证明，这不是空想，而是现实。
    第二个好处是：可以总结群众的经验，传播具体的作法。不少地方，有了先进指标，不一定都有具体措施，或者在这一件工作上有了具体措施，在那一件工作上还没有具体措施；或者虽然都有了具体措施，但还不是先进的或者不完全是先进的。而如果没有先进的措施，先进的指标往往就会落空。“十六看”的提出，使广大群众参观学习了这些先进典型以后，不仅会增强信心，还可以学到办法，使制订不出措施的也会制订措施了；措施不能具体的能具体了，不能先进的能先进了。这就能使跃进指标的实现，得到可靠的保证。
    第三个好处是：运用“十六看”的办法，也解决了组织和动员群众的方法问题。大家都知道，措施也是要人去实施的。动员和组织人力，是有不同的作法的，一种是用强迫命令，一种是用说服教育，而摆事实，讲道理，就是最有力的说服教育的方法。大埔乡的经验之所以被特别重视，并在全县推广，道理也就在这里。
    第四个好处：有了这么多的典型，领导同志的办法也就多了：养猪圈猪工作有鹿溪乡的经验可参考；改良土壤工作有英山乡的经验可参考；造林护林的工作，有青果乡的经验可参考。这是真正的从群众中来到群众中去的方法，只要认真地执行这个路线，学会这种方法，领导水平就会大大提高一步，工作就会大大开展。
  漳浦县“十六看”的方法，是一个全面的领导方法，值得大大提倡。这当然不是说每个地区都来个“十六看”，而是说应当学习漳浦县，做到“人人抓典型，事事有榜样，项项有观摩”。
