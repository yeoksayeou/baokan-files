    Old Man Gui Digs a Well
    In our village, Yang Laogui, a family member of a revolutionary martyr, in order to support the collective in digging a well, took out the two thousand bricks he had saved for building a house, and also took out the finished cypress coffin and burial garments, selling them for more than 250 yuan to invest in the collective.
    Old Man Gui is seventy-five years old, and he also participated in digging the well, working alongside the young men.
    The well was close to completion. Suddenly, quicksand was discovered. The well was about to be ruined, and every member of the collective felt as if their hearts were being bitten by cats.
    Old Man Gui, old and experienced, carefully examined the situation up and down for a long time. Coming up from the well, he picked up his sheepskin coat and went down into the well again. The men and women members of the collective pulling the pulley above the well, no one could figure out what was happening, and everyone stared at him with curious eyes. Old Man Gui went down into the well and used his own sheepskin coat to block the quicksand hole, saving the well. His exemplary action spread like wildfire throughout the village. The members of the collective beat gongs and drums and hung a glorious plaque of "Model of Loving the Collective" on his house.

    老桂爷打井
    俺村烈属杨老桂大爷，为了支援社里打井，把盖房用的二千块砖拿了出来，又把做好的柏木棺材和寿衣拿出来，卖了二百五十多元，投资到社里。
    老桂爷七十五岁了，也参加了打井，和小伙子们一起干活。
    井眼看快要成功了。忽然发现了流沙。井要完蛋了，社员们个个心像猫咬。
    老桂爷年老有经验，上上下下的仔细打量了半天，从井下上来，拿起那件羊皮袄又下了井。井上拉滑车的男女社员们，谁也弄不清是怎么回事，个个都瞪着好奇的眼睛望着他。老桂爷下了井，用自己的皮袄堵住了流沙洞，保住了这眼井。他的模范行动，一阵风似的传遍了全村。社员们敲着锣打着鼓给他挂上了“爱社模范”的光荣匾。
