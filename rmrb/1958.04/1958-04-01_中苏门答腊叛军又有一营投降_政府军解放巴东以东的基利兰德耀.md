Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 31st: "East Star Daily" reported today that Indonesian government troops, in military operations launched southwest from Pekanbaru in Central Sumatra, seized a large amount of supplies, including a transmitter marked with the US "Texaco" oil company logo, as well as several thousand tons of rice, hundreds of large barrels of oil, and light and heavy weapons. These supplies were hidden by the rebels in the jungle.

The military operation began on March 22nd. Indonesian government troops, passing through Kebun Durian, Lipat Kain, and Taluk, advanced directly to Kiliran Jao, east of Padang and directly opposite Padang. Kiliran Jao has now been liberated. During the military operation, one battalion of rebels surrendered to government troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 31st: Antara News Agency reported that Indonesian military authorities recently arrested a number of people, including ten prominent figures from the North Sumatra police and sixty members of the Masyumi Party.

Indonesia's "People's Daily" reported today that the arrest of the sixty Masyumi Party members in North Sumatra was because, when Nainggolan launched the rebellion, the North Sumatra branch of the Masyumi Party, the Masyumi-led Indonesian Islamic Trade Union, and the Indonesian Islamic Youth Movement jointly signed a statement on March 16, expressing support for Nainggolan's rebellious activities.

Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: According to a report from Antara News Agency reporters in Balikpapan, Sulawesi, there are indications that rebel groups in North Sulawesi are using copra to exchange for weapons such as guns and grenades through Tawau in British North Borneo.

It is reported that in the past ten days, approximately thirty fast sailing ships have carried 1,350 tons of copra from rebel-controlled North Sulawesi to Tawau. Sailors on the ships said that these goods were transported to Tawau under the order of Sombah, a North Sulawesi rebel.

It is reported that twenty of these thirty fast sailing ships have already returned to North Sulawesi.

    中苏门答腊叛军又有一营投降
    政府军解放巴东以东的基利兰德耀
    新华社雅加达31日电　“东星报”今天报道，印度尼西亚政府军队在从中苏门答腊的北干巴鲁向西南发动的军事行动中，缴获了大批物资，其中包括美国“德士古”石油公司标记的发报机，还有几千吨大米、几百大桶石油和轻、重武器。这些物资是叛军藏在丛林中的。
    这次军事行动是从3月22日开始的。印度尼西亚政府军队经过克崩杜龙、利帕特凯恩和塔卢克，直趋在巴东以东同巴东遥遥相对的基利兰德耀。基利兰德耀现在已经解放。在军事行动中，有一营叛军向政府军队投降。
    据新华社雅加达31日电据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚军事当局最近逮捕了一些人，其中包括十名北苏门答腊警察方面的显要人物和六十名马斯友美党党员。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”今天报道，逮捕北苏门答腊的六十名马斯友美党党员，是因为当奈恩戈兰发动叛乱的时候，马斯友美党北苏门答腊支部、马斯友美党领导的印度尼西亚伊斯兰工会和印度尼西亚伊斯兰青年运动在3月16日共同签署了一项声明，表示声援奈恩戈兰的反叛活动。
    据新华社31日讯　据安塔拉通讯社记者自苏拉威西的巴厘巴板报道说，有迹象表明，北苏拉威西的叛乱集团正在通过英属北婆罗洲东部的斗胡，用椰干交换枪炮和手榴弹等武器。
    据报道，在最近十天当中，大约有三十只快帆船载运了一千三百五十吨椰干，从叛乱分子控制下的北苏拉威西开到斗胡。船上的水手说，这些东西是根据北苏拉威西叛乱分子宋巴的命令载运到斗胡的。
    据报道，这三十只快帆船中已经有二十只回到北苏拉威西。
