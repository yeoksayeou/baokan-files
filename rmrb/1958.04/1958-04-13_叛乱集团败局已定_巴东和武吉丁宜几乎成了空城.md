Xinhua News Agency, April 12th: A dispatch from Medan by the Associated Press on the 11th revealed that the Central Sumatran rebel group is in a state of panic and despair. The dispatch stated that Padang is now very different from when the rebel group's officers and politicians announced the establishment of a "government" on February 15th, and it is now almost an empty city. Bukittinggi is also much the same.

The dispatch said that although the rebel group's leaders are still talking about making a final struggle, their private conversations actually imply that they will abandon Padang and Bukittinggi - the last two major cities of the rebel group.

The rebel group's "Prime Minister," Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, said that the reasons for the rebel group's failure were: first, they did not receive the expected "support" from all of Sumatra, and the failure of the rebellion launched in Medan shattered one of their major hopes; second, the rebel group did not expect the government forces to attack. The dispatch also added another reason for the rebel group's failure: the government forces acted quickly and effectively, and the rebels fought poorly.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Bukittinggi, a spokesman for the Central Sumatran rebels said on the 11th that the rebels had received another batch of airdropped weapons from abroad this week, including some American-made guns. He said he could not explain the origin of these weapons. The rebel revealed that the Padang rebels conspired to blow up the port of Padang and destroy the airport there before fleeing.

    叛乱集团败局已定
    巴东和武吉丁宜几乎成了空城
    据新华社12日讯　美联社11日从棉兰发出的消息透露，中苏门答腊叛乱集团正处在惊惶和失望中。消息说，巴东现在同2月15日叛乱集团的校官和政客宣布成立“政府”的时候大不相同，它现在几乎成了一个空城。武吉丁宜也差不多是这样。
    消息说，叛乱集团的首脑们虽然还在谈论作最后的挣扎，但是，他们在私下的谈话实际上已经意味着将弃守巴东和武吉丁宜——叛乱集团的最后两个主要城市。
    叛乱集团“总理”沙弗鲁丁谈到叛乱集团失败的原因是：一、他们没有得到预期中的全苏门答腊的“支持”，而在棉兰发动的叛乱失败，使得他们的一个主要希望破灭了；二、叛乱集团没有料到政府军会进攻。消息还补充了叛乱集团失败的另一个原因：政府军行动迅速而有效，叛军打仗打得不好。
    另据美联社武吉丁宜消息，中苏门答腊叛军发言人在11日说，叛军本星期又从国外收到了一批空投武器，其中有一些美国制造的枪。他表示不能说明这些武器的来历。这个叛乱分子透露，巴东叛军在逃窜之前阴谋炸毁巴东港和破坏那里的机场。
