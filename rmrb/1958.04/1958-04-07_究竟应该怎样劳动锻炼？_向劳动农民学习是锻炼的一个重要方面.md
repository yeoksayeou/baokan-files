    How exactly should one engage in labor training?
    Learning from laboring peasants is an important aspect of training
    After reading Comrade Yu Zhiming's letter (People's Daily, April 5, page 4), I have many things to say. Now, I will only discuss the issue of learning from peasants with Comrade Yu Zhiming.
    Laboring peasants have many things worth learning from us. First is their ideology of treating the collective as their home. After collectivization, they all regard the cooperative as their lifeline, and they spare no personal expense for the benefit of the cooperative. In order to achieve water conservancy, many of our cooperative members invested most of the cash they received from the year-end settlement, some investing six or seven hundred yuan, leaving only twenty or thirty yuan for themselves. A poor peasant said, "Not eating meat during the Spring Festival won't cause any problems, but not investing in machines will make it impossible to make a great leap forward." Many cooperative cadres and team cadres wanted to sell their bicycles to invest, someone said, "Not riding a bike won't stop us from working, investing in machines is what counts as realizing water conservancy." There are many similar examples. Whether in production or work, one can always see touching deeds of selfless labor, disregard for oneself, and everything for the collective. However, before being sent to the countryside, I always viewed the laboring peasants after collectivization as individual farmers, thinking that their individualism would not be easily changed. Looking back now, I feel that it is my own individualism that is not easy to change. For example, last year when subscribing to public bonds, my economic conditions were relatively good, but fearing it would affect my life, I only subscribed to sixty yuan. After going to the countryside, influenced by the noble character of the laboring peasants who love the collective as their home, although my family burden is heavier this year than last year, I still invested in and bought one hundred yuan of public bonds. Therefore, I believe that learning the laboring peasants' ideology and behavior of loving the collective as their home is an effective remedy for overcoming the bourgeois individualistic thoughts of intellectuals.
    The laboring peasants' firm stand and clear-cut love and hate are even more things we need to learn. Before being sent to the countryside, I thought that since the rural areas had been collectivized, the class struggle had basically been resolved. But the fact is that each class and stratum has a completely different attitude towards socialism, the Communist Party, agricultural collectivization, the Party's various policies, and even towards us cadres sent to the countryside. The rural class struggle has not ended, and the Party's class line must be conscientiously implemented. For us, the clear class stand of the poor and lower-middle peasants is a very practical education. Our production team leader, Zhou Zhiqi (a poor peasant), is an example. Once, when he discovered that a rich peasant element was disobeying the group leader's leadership and attempting to use the cooperative's livestock privately, he immediately convened a meeting of cooperative members to deal with it. At the meeting, he took the lead, severely exposing the destructive words and deeds of the rich peasant element. When the rich peasant's mother was about to quibble, he immediately said sternly, "You have no right to speak here, listen honestly!" This greatly enhanced the prestige of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Other poor peasants also righteously exposed and criticized the rich peasant element.
    The laboring peasants' excellent style of saying one is one, and two is two, without falsehood or pretense, is also an important aspect for our cadres sent to the countryside to learn. They call this sincere and straightforward style: "A club in the sleeve, straight in and straight out." Not long after going to the countryside, I was picking corn cobs with an old cooperative member. I didn't know how to pick them, and I wanted to be quick, so I missed two cobs. The old cooperative member noticed it, immediately stopped me, and said, "It's not easy to grow a cob, can you afford to miss two? Hurry back and pick them off." Cooperative cadres and laboring peasants are all like this. If they see you performing well, they immediately praise you, and if you have shortcomings, they immediately criticize you. This style is exactly what I need to learn conscientiously. In the past, when I carried out criticism, I always took into account feelings, fearing that the opinions I raised were not correct or that the other party could not accept them, so I held back, beating around the bush, unable to be honest with each other. After going to the countryside, although I have tried to learn their consistent way of thinking, it is still relatively forced, and I cannot handle it skillfully when I encounter specific problems.
    From my practice in the past few months, I have realized that in order to clearly recognize the advantages of laboring peasants and truly learn from them, it is impossible to do so by simply participating in labor. We must consciously observe and analyze carefully in labor and in contact with peasants, and in work, and learn conscientiously and transform thoroughly in response to our own shortcomings and weaknesses. Only in this way will we change our thoughts and feelings, truly achieve breathing the same air and sharing the same love and hate with the working people, and achieve the goal of intellectuals becoming workers and peasants.

### 究竟应该怎样劳动锻炼？  向劳动农民学习是锻炼的一个重要方面

    究竟应该怎样劳动锻炼？
    向劳动农民学习是锻炼的一个重要方面
    读了余志明同志的来信（人民日报4月5日第四版）以后，有许多话要说。现在只同余志明同志谈谈向农民的学习问题。
    劳动农民有许多东西值得我们学习，首先是他们的以社为家的思想。合作化后，他们都把合作社看成是自己的命根子，为了社的利益毫不顾惜个人的一切。为了实现水利化，我们社有不少社员把年终决算分得的绝大部分现金拿来投资，有的投资六、七百元，自己只留下二、三十元。有位贫农说：“过春节不吃肉出不了事，不投资买机器可没法大跃进。”有不少社干部、队干部要卖掉自行车来投资，有人说：“不骑车还不是照样工作，投了资有了机器才算实现水利化。”类似这种事例是很多的，无论在生产上和工作上，时刻都可看到忘我劳动、不顾个人、一切为社的动人事迹。可是，自己在下放前总是以单干农民的形象来看待合作化后的劳动农民，以为他们的个人主义是不容易改变的。现在回想起来，觉得倒是自己的个人主义不容易改掉。比如去年认购公债，自己本来经济条件比较优裕，但是唯恐影响生活，只认购了六十元。下乡后由于受到劳动农民爱社如家的高贵品德的影响，今年虽然家庭负担比去年重，还投资和买公债一百元。因此，我认为学习劳动农民爱社如家的思想和行为，是克服知识分子资产阶级个人主义思想的有效良药。
    劳动农民立场坚定，爱憎分明，更是我们需要学习的。下放前，自己以为农村合作化了，阶级斗争基本上解决了。但事实却是各个阶级、阶层对待社会主义、共产党、农业合作化和党的各项政策，直到对待我们下放干部的态度是截然不同的。农村的阶级斗争还没有结束，党的阶级路线必须认真贯彻。对我们来讲，特别是贫农和下中农鲜明的阶级立场，是很实际的教育。我们生产队的队长周志岐（贫农）就是一个例子。一次，当他发现一个富农分子不服从组长领导、企图私用合作社的牲口时，立即召集社员大会进行处理。会上，他一马当先，狠狠地揭露了富农分子的破坏言行，当该富农的母亲刚要狡辩时，他立即声色俱厉地说：“这里没有你的发言权，你老老实实的听着！”大大的长了贫农和下中农的威风。其他的贫农也义正词严地对这个富农分子进行了揭露和批评。
    劳动农民说一是一，说二是二，不虚假，不造作的优良作风，也是我们下放干部学习的一个重要方面。他们把这种诚恳直率的作风称为：“袖口吞棒棰，直出直入”。下乡不久，曾和老社员一起掰玉米棒子，不会掰，又图快，结果有两个棒子遗漏了，老社员发觉后，马上叫住我，说：“长一个棒子可不容易，漏掉两个还行？快回去掰下来。”社干部和劳动农民都是这样，看见你表现好马上表扬，有缺点立刻批评。这种作风正是自己需要认真学习的。过去自己在开展批评时老是顾全情面，怕意见提得不对或者对方不能接受，话到嘴边留三分，拐弯抹角，吞吞吐吐，不能以心相见。下乡后，虽然努力学习他们表里如一的思想作风，但总还比较勉强，在遇见具体问题时，还不能得心应手。
    从我几个月来的实践中，体会到要明确地认识到劳动农民的优点和真正向他们学习，依靠一般的参加劳动是无法做到的。必须要在劳动中和农民的接触中、工作中，自觉地仔细地进行观察分析，针对自己的缺点弱点，认真学习，彻底改造。只有这样，才会改变自己的思想感情，真正做到和劳动人民同呼吸共爱憎，达到知识分子工农化的目的。	北京丰台区友谊农业社新社员
