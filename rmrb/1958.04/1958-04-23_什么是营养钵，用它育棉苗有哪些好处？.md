    What are nutrient pots? Nutrient pots are cylindrical clods of soil made by pressing together well-rotted compost or manure and soil. Currently, many regions use them to cultivate cotton seedlings for transplanting, and some regions use them to cultivate peanuts, corn, etc. for transplanting. This method was introduced to our country from the Soviet Union. The square grid seedling cultivation method used in some areas of our country has a similar effect to nutrient pot seedling cultivation.
    The benefits of using nutrient pots to grow cotton seedlings:
    1.  Early sowing is possible: Timely early sowing is one of the measures to achieve early maturity and high yield of cotton. In cotton areas with two crops a year, cotton is generally intercropped between the rows of summer crops. Cotton seedlings are shaded by summer crops for a long period, and cannot grow well. If cotton is planted after the summer crops are harvested, it is too late. Using seedling transplanting can solve this contradiction, and summer crops can also be densely planted.
    2.  Strong seedlings can be cultivated and full stands guaranteed: Nutrient pots contain a lot of fertilizer, and the seedlings cultivated with them grow particularly strong. Transplanting these seedlings into the field allows planting at the intended spacing. Missing seedlings can be replaced with pots containing seedlings, so there will be no incomplete stands of cotton seedlings.
    3.  Seeds are saved: Ten catties of seeds for seedling cultivation can supply four or five mu of cotton fields for transplanting. These seeds are only enough for one mu if directly sown.
    How to Make Nutrient Pots
    1.  Pot soil mix: The components of the pot soil are 30% well-rotted manure or compost, and 70% topsoil (manure, compost, and topsoil should be fully crushed or sieved). Half a catty to one catty of superphosphate can also be added to every hundred catties of pot soil.
    First, mix the phosphate with the manure and compost, and add an appropriate amount of water (generally, the amount of water added is appropriate when the pot soil can be formed into a ball when held in the hand and can be scattered when dropped). After the pot soil is mixed, it can be pressed with a pressing tool.
    2.  Pressing tools: Various places have created tools for making nutrient pots. The East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences designed a "hand-pressing pot maker." This machine is mostly made of wood, only the pressing cylinder is made of iron pipe or bamboo (see Figure 1).
    The pot maker used in Hubei, Beijing and other places (see Figure 2) is very simple. After filling the cylinder with soil, it is compacted and a foot pedal is used to push it out, making a pot.
    After the nutrient pots are made, place the pots in the seedbed (the pot surface must be arranged flat). The seedbed is generally four feet wide, and the length is determined as needed. In order to reduce water evaporation and keep warm, the space between the pots should be filled with soil. After the pots are placed, sow one or two seeds (with the seed tip down or flat) that have been soaked and mixed with medicine in each pot, and then cover with four or five centimeters of fine soil.

### 什么是营养钵，用它育棉苗有哪些好处？

    什么是营养钵，用它育棉苗有哪些好处？
    营养钵是用腐熟的堆肥或厩肥和土壤混合压制的圆柱型团土块。目前许多地区用它培育移栽的棉苗，有些地区用它培育移栽的花生、玉米等。这一方法是由苏联介绍到我国的。我国有的地区所应用的方格育苗法，效果和营养钵育苗相仿。
    用营养钵育棉苗的好处
    1、可以提早播种：适时早播是获得棉花早熟丰产的措施之一。在一年两熟的棉区，棉花一般套种在夏熟作物行间，棉苗在较长时期里受到夏熟作物的荫蔽，不能很好生长；要是在夏熟作物收获以后再种棉花，又嫌太晚。采用育苗移栽可以解决这一矛盾，而且夏熟作物还可以实行密植。
    2、可以培育壮苗、保证全苗：营养钵含肥分很多，利用它培育出来的幼苗，生长的特别健壮。把这种幼苗移栽大田，完全可以按照预定的株行距种植，缺了苗还可以用带苗的钵子补栽，这样就不会出现棉苗不全的现象了。
    3、节省种籽：十斤种子育苗，可以供四、五亩棉田移栽。这些种子用来直播，只够一亩。
      营养钵的制法
    1、钵土的配合：钵土成分是三成腐熟厩肥、堆肥，七成表土（厩肥、堆肥和表土要充分揉碎或筛过），每百斤钵土中还可以加入半斤至一斤的过磷酸钙。
    先将磷酸钙与厩肥、堆肥和匀，并加适量的水（一般加水量以将钵土用手握可以成团，丢下可以散开为适当）。钵土混合好了以后，就可以用压制工具压制了。
    2、压制工具：制造营养钵的工具，各地有一些创造。华东农科所设计了一种“手压制钵器”，这种机械大部用木料制成，只有压筒是用铁管子或竹子。（如图一）
    湖北、北京等地使用的制钵器（如图二）很简便，把土装满筒子以后，压实，用脚蹬出就制成一个。
    营养钵作好以后，把钵子排在苗床内（钵面必须排得平整）。苗床一般宽四尺，长度根据需要而定。为了减少水分蒸发和保温，钵与钵之间应填土。钵放好后，每个钵内播一、二粒经过浸种和拌药的种子（籽尖向下或平放），再盖上四、五公分细土。（附图片）
