    ——On the Soviet Union's Decision to Cease Nuclear Weapon Testing
    Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, in a statement delivered at a joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on March 31, announced the Soviet Union's decision to cease nuclear weapon testing and called upon the United States and the United Kingdom to adopt the same decision. In order to do its utmost to liberate humanity from the threat of atomic warfare, the Soviet government has taken this action, which will powerfully promote the permanent and universal cessation of experimental nuclear weapon explosions.
    People throughout the world welcome this great, groundbreaking Soviet initiative for promoting peace and benefiting humanity with boundless gratitude.
    In recent years, the cessation of nuclear weapon testing has become a widespread and universal demand of people in all countries. This past January, over nine thousand authoritative scientists from forty-four countries, in an appeal to the United Nations, pointed out that the unrestricted conduct of nuclear testing will cause harm to the health of humanity and our descendants. The scientists' appeal further demonstrates that the early cessation of nuclear weapon testing is not only a necessary step for promoting peace, but also an urgent measure for safeguarding human health and the happiness of our descendants.
    The Soviet Union has made unremitting efforts to promote the early realization of the cessation of nuclear testing. In the United Nations General Assembly, in the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, and in the exchange of letters with the heads of government of Western countries in preparation for a summit meeting, the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed that the countries concerned immediately cease nuclear weapon testing for two to three years, and advocated the implementation of international supervision over this. These Soviet proposals are not only practical and feasible, but even many important figures in Western countries' political circles believe they are acceptable. However, these efforts by the Soviet Union have been rejected by the Western countries, led by the United States. Until recently, the United States continued to create difficulties on this issue by insisting that the production of fissionable materials for military purposes must be stopped simultaneously as a precondition. Just two days ago, the United States even announced that it insisted on starting nuclear weapon testing in the Pacific on April 5 according to the original plan. This shows the extent to which the ruling circles of the United States despise the universal aspirations of people throughout the world.
    Like the attitude of the United States, Britain and France have also adopted a delaying and negative attitude towards the issue of ceasing nuclear weapon testing. Britain's excuse is that it is still in a relatively backward state in terms of nuclear weapons! As for France, it is trying its best to possess nuclear weapons. Such practices by Britain and France can only intensify the arms race of nuclear weapons, which is also very unfavorable to them.
    Clearly, the reason why the desire of people in all countries to cease nuclear weapon testing has not been realized so far is entirely the responsibility of the Western countries, especially the United States.
    However, despite this, in order to satisfy the wishes of people in all countries, the Soviet Union took the lead in deciding to unilaterally cease testing in order to prompt the United States and Britain to take the same action. What reason do the United States, Britain, and Western countries that are not yet able to produce nuclear weapons have to refuse to take the same action?
    However, people cannot fail to notice that at present, Western countries are intensifying nuclear war preparations. The joint establishment of rocket bases on British territory by the United States and Britain, and the transportation of atomic weapons by the United States to its military bases around the world, are all actions that run counter to the policy of easing international tensions. What is especially alarming is that the United States and its West German partners are trying their best to worsen the international situation and create the terror of atomic warfare. Under the manipulation of the Adenauer government, the West German Federal Parliament recently passed a resolution to arm West German forces with atomic weapons. It goes without saying that the West German government took this action because it was instructed and encouraged by the United States. At a time when people in all countries are eager to hold a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries, the United States and West German authorities are eagerly handing atomic weapons over to West German militarist elements, and their purpose is clearly to create obstacles to the efforts to seek a cessation of the arms race at the summit meeting. This action by the West German government has been severely condemned by people in all countries and world public opinion.
    Until now, among the countries that possess atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, only the Soviet Union is sincerely prepared to sign an agreement to terminate nuclear weapon testing without delay. Therefore, the Soviet Union's announcement of the unilateral cessation of nuclear weapon testing is only the first step in universally ceasing nuclear testing, promoting the development of international relations in the direction of enhancing trust and peaceful cooperation between countries, and does not mean that the danger of atomic warfare has been completely eliminated. Now it depends on the attitude of the United States and Britain. If the United States and Britain continue to adopt a stubborn attitude, refuse to respond to the Soviet Union's action, and continue to test nuclear weapons, then the Soviet Union, considering its own security interests, will naturally act freely on the issue of testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.
    The Soviet Union has already opened up a bright path for the prospects of peace. In order to consolidate the achievements of the Soviet Union's efforts to strive for peace, people in all countries must also strive to force the United States and Britain to respond to the Soviet Union's call and permanently cease nuclear weapon testing.

### 人类的福音——评苏联决定停止核武器试验

    人类的福音
    ——评苏联决定停止核武器试验
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯3月31日在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上发表声明，宣布苏联决定停止核武器的试验，并呼吁美国和英国也采取同样的决定。苏联政府为了尽力达到使人类摆脱原子战争的威胁，采取了这个行动，它将有力地推动永远和普遍地结束核武器的试验性爆炸。
    全世界人民怀着无限感激的心情，来欢迎苏联这一个促进和平、造福人类的伟大创举。
    近年以来，停止核武器试验，已经成为各国人民普遍和广泛的要求。今年1月间，四十四个国家的九千多名权威的科学家在向联合国提出的呼吁书中指出，无限制地进行核试验将使人类和我们后代的健康遭受损害。科学家们的这种呼吁更显示出早日停止核武器试验不仅是促进和平的必要步骤，而且也是维护人类健康和我们的后代的幸福的迫切措施。
    苏联为了促成停止核试验的早日实现，曾进行了不断的努力。苏联在联合国大会上，在联合国裁军委员会的小组委员会上，以及在为举行最高级会议与西方国家政府首脑的书信来往中，都曾一再建议有关国家立即停止核武器试验两年到三年，并主张对此实行国际监督。苏联的这些建议不但是实际可行的，而且连许多西方国家政界的重要人物也认为是可以接受的。但是，苏联的这种努力，却遭到了以美国为首的西方国家的拒绝。直到最近，美国依然以必须同时停止用于军事目的的裂变物质的生产为条件，继续给这个问题制造困难。就在前两天，美国甚至还宣布坚持要按照原订计划在4月5日开始在太平洋试验核武器。这说明美国统治集团对于全世界人民的普遍愿望是何等蔑视。
    同美国的这种态度一样，英国和法国对停止核武器试验的问题也采取了拖延和否定的态度。英国的借口是它在核武器方面还处于比较落后的状态！至于法国，则竭力要使自己拥有核武器。英法的这种做法，显然只能加剧核武器的军备竞赛，这对于它们本身也是十分不利的。
    显然，各国人民要求停止核武器试验的这个愿望所以到现在还未能实现，其责任完全是在西方国家，特别是在美国的身上。
    但是，尽管如此，苏联为了满足各国人民的愿望，率先决定单方面地停止试验，以促使美英采取同样的行动。美国、英国以及现在还不能生产核武器的西方国家，还有什么理由拒绝采取同样的行动呢？
    然而人们不能不注意，目前，西方国家还在加紧核备战。美英共同在英国领土上设立火箭基地，美国把原子武器运到它在世界各处的军事基地，都是同缓和国际紧张局势的方针背道而驰的。尤其值得警惕的，是美国和它的西德伙伴在竭力恶化国际局势，制造原子战争的恐怖。西德联邦议会在阿登纳政府的操纵下，最近通过了以原子武器武装西德部队的决定。西德政府所以要采取这个行动，不用说是由于受到美国的指使和鼓励。美国和西德当局在各国人民渴望举行东西方国家最高级会议的时候，迫不及待地要把原子武器交到西德军国主义分子的手中，其目的显然是要为最高级会议谋求停止军备竞赛的努力制造障碍。西德政府的这种行动，已经受到各国人民和世界舆论的严厉谴责。
    直到现在，所有拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家中，唯有苏联是真诚准备毫不拖延地签订一项协定来终止核武器试验的。因之，苏联宣布了单方面停止核武器试验，只是在普遍停止核试验、促使国际关系向着增强国与国之间的信任和和平合作方向的发展，走了第一步，并不意味着完全消除了原子战争的危险。现在就要看美英两国的态度了。美英如果继续采取顽固的态度，不肯响应苏联的行动而继续试验核武器，那末苏联考虑到自己安全的利益，自然将在试验原子武器和氢武器这一问题上自由行动。
    苏联已经为和平的前景打开了光明的道路，为了巩固苏联争取和平努力的成果，各国人民还必须努力迫使美英两国响应苏联的呼吁，永远停止核武器的试验。
