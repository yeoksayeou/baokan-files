Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 11th:石林秀 (Shí Línxiù), a Miao youth from the Zhuangjia Agricultural Cooperative in Jishou County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, successfully created a wooden water-pressing machine with good results. This year, the Zhuangjia Agricultural Cooperative plans to install nine of these machines, transforming more than 300 mu of annually drought-stricken fields into fertile land. In addition, it can improve irrigation for another 200 mu, expanding the double-cropping rice area from 240 mu to 700 mu.

This wooden water-pressing machine is made based on the principle of water mills and mechanical water-lifting in mountainous areas. It uses water power to drive a wooden turbine, which in turn drives a turntable, causing the lifting and lowering of the water-pressing rod in the water-pressing pipe, thus drawing water from the spray pipe to the fields.

The Xiangxi area has dense streams and abundant timber. Therefore, this wooden water-pressing machine is very suitable for drought resistance in mountainous areas. Due to its simple structure and low cost, local farm tool factories and agricultural cooperatives can manufacture and install it.

    苗族青年创造压水机
    新华社长沙11日电  湘西土家族苗族自治州吉首县庄稼农业社苗族青年石林秀创制木质压水机成功，效果良好。今年，庄稼农业社计划安装九个，全社三百多亩年年受旱的田将变成良田，另外还可以改善灌溉面积二百亩，使双季稻由二百四十亩扩大到七百亩。
    这种木质压水机是根据山区水碾和机器压水上升的原理制成的。它利用水力冲动木制涡轮机，带动转盘，使压水管的升降压水杆上下运动，就可把水从喷水管引到田里。
    湘西地区溪流密布，木材丰富。因此，这种木质压水机很适用于山区抗旱。由于它构造简单，成本低，地方农具厂、农业社都可以制造安装。
