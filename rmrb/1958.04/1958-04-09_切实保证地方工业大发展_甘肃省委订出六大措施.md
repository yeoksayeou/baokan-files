To Effectively Guarantee the Great Development of Local Industry
	Gansu Provincial Party Committee Formulates Six Major Measures

	(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 8th dispatch) The Gansu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an expanded meeting of its Standing Committee to review the development of local industry in the province over the past few months, and made a decision on the comprehensive support from state-owned industries and existing local industries within Gansu for the development of local industry. Through overall planning at the meeting, the equipment management cadres and technical personnel of a number of key factories and mines to be established in the province this year have been settled.

	Gansu Province plans to build 3,000 factories and mines of various sizes this year, most of which are small. These small factories mainly rely on the manpower and material resources of the masses, which is generally not a major problem. In the past three months, more than 1,050 factories have been built throughout the province. However, the construction of some larger factories this year faces more difficulties, the most important of which is the lack of equipment. To this end, after detailed investigation and ranking, the Standing Committee of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee made several specific provisions for the support of central state-owned industries and existing provincial local industries for the development of local industry: First, they are required to implement regional contracting and provide comprehensive guidance for the development of local industry. For example, Yumen Oilfield should be responsible for guiding the development of local industry in the Zhangye area. Second, they are required to divide labor according to industry system and help and guide the development of local industry. The province is roughly divided into major industries such as non-ferrous metal industry, coal industry, hydropower industry, coal-to-oil and oil shale industry, and geological resource exploration, which will be respectively responsible by Gansu Mining Bureau, Hydropower Design Institute, Lanzhou Refinery, and Gansu Provincial Geological Bureau. Third, fully utilize the existing technical strength and surplus and obsolete machinery and equipment of existing enterprises, and adopt the "mother hen laying eggs" method to help build a number of new factories and mines. Among them are mainly the comprehensive agricultural machinery manufacturing and distribution plants in fifteen counties. Fourth, adopt the method of large enterprises helping small ones, and relevant enterprises will help local governments establish coal mines, non-ferrous metal mines, as well as carpet factories, lanolin chemical factories, nitrogen fertilizer plants, power plants, coal-to-oil plants, and oil shale plants in terms of design, equipment, and technical strength. Fifth, factories and technical schools with manufacturing capabilities should divide the work to manufacture equipment for newly built factories. Sixth, all central enterprises and existing local enterprises must train technical personnel for newly built factories and mines and provide technical guidance. (Zhang Ming)

    切实保证地方工业大发展
    甘肃省委订出六大措施
    本报兰州8日电　中共甘肃省委最近召开常委扩大会议，检查了近几个月来全省地方工业的发展情况，并就甘肃境内的国营工业和现有地方工业全面支援发展地方工业问题作出决定。经过会议上的统筹安排，全省今年要举办的一批骨干工厂矿山的设备管理干部和技术人员，都有了着落。
    甘肃省今年要新建大小三千个工厂矿山，其中大部分是小型的。这些小型工厂主要依靠群众的人力、物力来办，一般问题不大，近三个月来，全省就建设起一千零五十多个工厂。但是，今年新建的一部分大些的工厂，困难就比较多，最主要的是缺乏设备。为此，甘肃省委常委会经过详细摸底排队以后，对中央国营工业和现有省属地方工业支援发展地方工业特作出几项规定：首先，要求它们按地区实行分片包干，全面指导地方工业的发展。例如玉门油矿要负责指导张掖专区的地方工业建设。其次，要求它们按行业系统分工，帮助与指导地方工业的发展。全省约分为有色金属工业、煤炭工业、水电工业、煤炼油和油母页岩工业、地质资源勘察等主要行业，要分别由甘肃矿务局、水电设计院、兰州炼油厂、甘肃省地质局等单位负责。第三，充分利用现有企业的技术力量和多余的、废旧的机器设备，采用“母鸡下蛋”的方法，帮助建设一批新厂矿。其中主要是十五个县的综合农具机械制配厂。第四，采取以大帮小的办法，由有关企业，从设计、设备、技术力量等方面帮助地方建立煤矿、有色金属矿，以及地毯厂、羊毛脂化学厂、氮肥厂、电厂、煤炼油厂、油母页岩厂等。第五，有制造能力的工厂、技工学校，要分工为新建工厂制造设备。第六，所有中央企业和现有地方企业，都必须为新建厂矿培训技术人才，以及进行技术指导。　（张鸣）
