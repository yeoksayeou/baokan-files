    Little Knowledge

    The wheat blossom midge belongs to the order Diptera, family Cecidomyiidae, and is commonly known as the small red worm, red mosquito, jaundice worm, wheat maggot, etc. The adult midge is a cecidomyiid fly much smaller than a mosquito, with a distinctly orange-yellow body. The larva is a small maggot of one to two millimeters. Adults mostly inhabit the back of wheat stalks, wheat leaves, or the ground with weeds, except for laying eggs and migrating.

    The wheat blossom midge harms wheat, as well as crops such as barley, oats, rye, and highland barley.

    Whether it rains before and during the heading and ripening stages of wheat has a great influence on the occurrence and death of the wheat blossom midge. If there is an appropriate amount of rainfall before and after the heading and flowering of wheat, a large number of wheat blossom midge larvae hiding in the soil can rise to the topsoil to pupate and emerge as adults. Conversely, the rise, pupation, and emergence of larvae will be less. (Attached pictures)

    小麦吸浆虫
    小麦吸浆虫属双翅目、瘿蝇科，俗名小红虫、红蚊子、黄疸虫、麦蛆虫等。吸浆虫的成虫是一种比蚊子还小得多的瘿蝇，虫体呈鲜明的橙黄色，幼虫是一、二公厘的小蛆。成虫除产卵迁移以外，大多栖息在麦秆、麦叶背面或有杂草的地面。
    小麦吸浆虫为害小麦，也为害大麦、燕麦、黑麦、青稞等作物。
    在小麦抽穗前和成熟时期下不下雨，对吸浆虫的发生和死亡有极大关系。如果在小麦抽穗和扬花前后有适量的雨水，潜伏在土里的吸浆虫幼虫就可以大量上升到表土，化蛹、羽化；相反，幼虫的上升、化蛹、羽化，就会少些。（附图片）
