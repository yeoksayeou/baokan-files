Production Great Leap Forward, Work Style Great Transformation
Tianjin's Double-Anti Movement Achieves Great Success

(Reported from Tianjin by our newspaper) Tianjin's Rectification Movement is developing comprehensively and deeply, taking the "double-anti" as the guiding principle. The high tide of airing views against waste and conservatism has just passed, and a new high tide of large-scale rectification and transformation is forming throughout the city.

Since the launch of the "double-anti" movement in Tianjin, more than 15 million big-character posters have been put up in just over twenty days. The momentum of the movement, its scale, the richness and variety of its content, and its far-reaching impact are unprecedented in previous movements. Faced with this vast sea of big-character posters, many units have adopted the method of boldly mobilizing the masses, with both superiors and subordinates working together to carry out large-scale rectification and transformation. Issues that the masses can solve themselves are resolved by mobilizing the masses themselves. Leaders focus their efforts on solving major issues related to work and production.

Driven by the wave of the "double-anti" movement, a new situation of a great leap forward in production and a comprehensive great leap forward in all aspects of work has emerged in the city, promoting the great enthusiasm of the whole people. The city's industrial output value growth targets have risen sharply. Many originally conceived balances have been broken once, twice, five, six, and even nine times by the surging mass movement. In the Hebei District, the planned annual output value of more than 100 factories increased by 58% after the start of the "double-anti" movement, and by 80% after the movement entered its climax. Hospitals throughout the city can add more than 1,000 beds without increasing investment. Many unreasonable rules and regulations that hindered the development of productive forces and affected the enthusiasm of the masses have been broken. Some people's thinking lagged behind the situation. They only saw things and not people, and did not understand that objective difficulties could be overcome through subjective efforts. Therefore, they doubted whether these targets could be achieved. Facts have given them a positive answer. After the masses put forward the targets, they immediately started working hard. "Miracles" that were unimaginable in the past have appeared. One section of the Tianjin Cigarette Factory only received five "Excellent" awards throughout the whole year last year; in the first 19 days of March this year, it received 190. The problem of dry ends of tobacco leaves that had not been solved for many years has been completely solved. The Paper Mill used to take more than four hours to cook a pot of pulp. In February and March, it set four new records in a row and has now shortened the time to one hour and forty-seven minutes. Workers in nine construction units across the city launched a "treasure digging" and "treasure offering" campaign, finding more than 10 million pieces of various materials and tools in half a month. Designers completed 73% of the annual plan by March 25th, ahead of schedule. In order to achieve the leap forward targets, the masses have proposed that not only should they rely on hard work, but also on diligence, and not only on courage, but also on learning technology. The seeds of mass technological innovation have sprung up everywhere. Activities to improve tools, improve equipment, and learn advanced technologies have been launched among the broad masses. The Bicycle Factory can increase production by 210,000 bicycles by only updating some equipment. The construction department has adopted more than 50 new technologies, among which the promotion of prestressed reinforced concrete alone can save 60% of steel, and such examples are endless. Under the bold slogan of "There is no technology in the world that we cannot learn," a surge of learning technology is about to be set off throughout the city.

To adapt to the new situation of a comprehensive great leap forward in all undertakings, the ideological style and leadership methods of cadres at all levels have also undergone a profound revolution. Bureaucratism that hindered the development of productive forces and the enthusiasm of the masses has been overthrown, and the working method of the mass line has been consciously used by more and more cadres. At the beginning of the movement, from the secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, the ministers of various departments, to the heads of various district committees, party committees, and grassroots units, they all went out of their offices, went deep into the grassroots, established experimental fields, and summarized the experience of the masses. After the Second Printing and Dyeing Factory created the experience of following-shift labor, more than 1,800 leading cadres in 506 factories across the city have implemented following-shift labor. Administrative leaders and party committee secretaries at all levels of the construction engineering system have also moved to the workers' sheds to eat, live, and work with the workers. The commercial sector has established experimental stores. Leading cadres of organs have also gone deep into the lower levels. Many difficult problems in production or work have been solved in a timely manner. After Zhang Jian, the general branch secretary of the Tianjin Enamel Factory, followed-shift labor, he relied on veteran workers and technicians to solve the quality problem. The gloss of the enamel has increased from 65 degrees in the past to more than 95 degrees, and the adhesion has reached more than 12,500 grams per centimeter, the quality exceeding the most advanced level in the country.

A widespread ideological remoulding movement of criticism and self-criticism has been further deepened among industrialists and businessmen, democratic parties, and intellectuals throughout the city. The heart-to-heart movement of industrialists and businessmen throughout the city has entered a climax. They carry out heart-to-heart challenges to each other. There are many good stories of wives helping husbands, brothers helping brothers, posting big-character posters to each other, and criticizing each other. This heart-to-heart movement has enabled the bourgeoisie to take a step forward on the road of self-remoulding. Zhang Guofan, President of Tianjin University and physicist, presided over meetings on Sunday mornings and wrote materials until late at night. He wrote 120 articles a day and received the "Heart-to-Heart Red Flag" four times.

At present, under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Tianjin's "double-anti" movement is advancing victoriously, continuing to expand its achievements, and developing towards a broader and deeper aspect. At the same time, a series of measures have also been taken to more closely integrate the "double-anti" movement with the great leap forward in production, and strive for an unprecedented bumper harvest on the economic, political, and ideological fronts.

### 生产大跃进　作风大转变  天津双反运动大丰收

    生产大跃进　作风大转变
    天津双反运动大丰收
    本报天津电　天津市的整风运动正以双反为纲，全面向深入发展。反浪费、反保守的鸣放高潮刚刚过去，大整大改的高潮又在全市形成。
    天津市开展双反运动以后，二十多天就贴出了一千五百多万张大字报。运动来势之猛，规模之大，内容之丰富多采，影响之深远，都为历次运动所仅见。在这浩如烟海的大字报面前，许多单位采取了放手发动群众，上下一齐动手，大整大改的办法。凡是群众自己能解决的问题，发动群众自己解决，领导上集中力量解决有关工作和生产上的重大问题。
    在双反运动的浪潮推动之下，出现了全市生产大跃进及各项工作全面大跃进的新形势，促进了全民大干劲。全市工业产值增长指标直线上升，许多原来设想的平衡，一次，再次，五次、六次乃至九次被万马奔腾的群众运动所突破。河北区一百多个工厂在双反开始后跃进计划年产值共增长58％，运动进入高潮以后，增长到80％。全市医院在不增加投资的条件下，可增加一千多张病床。许多束缚生产力发展和影响群众积极性的不合理的规章制度已被突破。有些人思想落后于形势，只见物不见人，不懂得客观困难条件经过主观努力可以克服，因而怀疑这些指标是否能实现，事实给他们作出了肯定的答案。广大群众在提出指标以后，立即大干起来。过去想像不到的“奇迹”出现了。天津卷烟厂的一个工段，去年全年才得了五个“优”字；今年3月前十九天，就得到一百九十个。多年没解决的烟叶干头干尾问题，已得到彻底解决。造纸总厂过去四个多小时才能煮一锅纸浆，2、3月份连创四次新纪录，现已缩短到一小时零四十七分。全市九个建筑单位的工人展开了“挖宝”“献宝”运动，半个月就找出各种器材、工具一千多万件。设计人员3月25日就提前完成了全年计划的73％。为了实现跃进指标，广大群众提出不仅靠干劲，还要加钻劲，不仅靠勇敢，还要学技术。群众性的技术革新的萌芽已到处涌现。改进工具、改进设备、学习先进技术的活动，已在广大群众中展开。自行车厂只更新一部分设备，就可增产二十一万辆自行车。建筑部门采用五十多种新技术，其中像推行预加应力钢筋混凝土一项就可节约钢筋60％的事例，更是层出不穷。在“世界上有我们不会的技术，没有我们学不会的技术”的豪迈口号下，全市即将掀起一个学习技术的热潮。
    适应各项事业全面大跃进的新形势，各级干部的思想作风和领导方法，也经历了一次深刻的革命。束缚生产力发展和群众积极性的官风已被打倒，群众路线的工作方法为越来越多的干部自觉地运用。运动一开始，从市委书记处的书记、各部部长、到各区委、党委和基层单位的负责人，纷纷走出办公室，深入基层，建立试验田，总结群众经验。第二印染厂创造跟班劳动的经验以后，全市已有五百零六个工厂的一千八百多名领导干部实行了跟班劳动。建筑工程系统的各级行政领导干部、党委书记等，也搬到工棚，与工人同吃同住同劳动。商业部门建立了试验商店。机关领导干部也深入下层。很多生产或工作中的难题，得到及时解决。天津搪瓷厂总支书记张健跟班劳动以后，依靠老工人和技术人员解决了质量问题。搪瓷的光泽度由过去的六十五度提高到九十五度以上，密着力达到一万二千五百克厘以上，质量超过了全国最先进的水平。
    一个广泛的批评与自我批评的思想改造运动，已在全市工商业者、民主党派、知识分子中进一步深入展开。全市工商业者的交心运动，已经进入高潮。他们互相开展交心挑战。妻帮夫、哥帮弟，互相贴大字报，互相批评的佳话很多。这个交心运动，已使资产阶级分子在自我改造的道路上跨进了一步。天津大学校长、物理学家张国藩，星期天上午主持会议，下午写材料直到深夜。他一天写了一百二十条，四次得到交心红旗。
    目前，天津市的双反运动正在中共天津市委员会的领导下乘胜前进，继续扩张战果，向更广泛更深入方面发展。同时，还采取了一系列的措施，使双反运动与生产大跃进更紧密的结合，争取经济、政治、思想战线上来一个空前的大丰收。
