    Public Affairs Managed by All
    Yang Xuan
    Aunt Wang next door has been even more talkative these past few days. Whenever she sees me, she grabs my arm and starts talking and laughing endlessly. She says, "Our women's casual talk is still casual talk, but our casual talk also discusses national affairs. I've been pondering this: why does our casual talk always end up involving national affairs? Am I, this old woman, just getting more nosy as I get older? But then I thought, no, this isn't being nosy; national affairs are everyone's affairs, and if everyone doesn't manage them, who will? That's why I've gotten all worked up about the election."

    I said, "Auntie is absolutely right; everyone should manage public affairs, or what kind of democracy would that be!"

    Auntie laughed as soon as she heard that. She said, "Before, I just couldn't get my old brain working right. I always felt that common people, well, they need someone to manage them! In the countryside, it's the village cadres who manage things, and in the city, it's the police station. In previous years, there were elections and talk of democracy, and I thought, well, just vote, I guess; at most, you just pick a good person to manage you? During elections, people were always being urged to criticize the cadres, but I always felt that you can't fight city hall, right? If you criticize them, they might not say anything to your face, but they'll retaliate later, and you'll be the one who suffers. People talk about equality, but in your heart, you're afraid, and you always feel that how can common people be equal to the cadres? Besides, if everyone stopped obeying, wouldn't things fall into chaos?"

    "Now I understand. After the rectification campaign, everyone stood up and spoke out, and we often meet and interact with the cadres. Seeing the cadres sincerely doing things and listening to the people, I understood: it's not that the cadres don't want us to manage, it's that we didn't dare to manage in the past. So that's what our democracy is all about: we elect representatives, and the representatives manage affairs on our behalf, and naturally they have to manage each and every household; but we also have the power to manage them. That's how it is, the cadres manage us, and we manage the cadres. That's what it means to have everyone manage public affairs. Isn't that equality!"

    Auntie is old and has a lot of experience. Even such a simple principle was not easy for her to understand. I'm sharing this as casual talk, and maybe it will be helpful to some other aunties and older women!

### 家常话

    众人的事众人管
    杨萱
    隔壁王大妈这几天更爱说话了，见了面一把拉住，连说带笑的就没个完。她说：“咱娘们家常话还是家常话，不过，咱们的家常话，也谈的是国家事。我老这么琢磨：为什么家常事谈着谈着，就掺上国家事了，我这老婆子不是越老越管起闲事来了吗；后来一想，不哇，这并不分外呀，国家的事，也就是众人的事，众人不管让谁管呀？这不是，我也就跑腾起选举的事来了。”
    我说：“大妈说的可真好，本来嘛，众人的事就要众人管呀，不然叫什么民主哇！”
    大妈一听就乐啦，她说：“以前我呀，就是老脑筋不开窍，总觉着，百姓百性吗，没个人管着还行啊！在乡下就得属村干部管，进城就得属派出所管。往年也闹选举、嚷民主民主的，我想，投投票就投投票吧，最多也不过是挑个好人来管自己?。选举时，也是一个劲儿地叫人批评干部，可是我觉着胳膊总扭不过大腿去吧？批评了他当面不说啥，过后给你个报复，还不是要自己吃亏。嘴里说平等，可心里怕，老觉得百姓怎么能跟当干部的平等啊，再一说，那么一来，大家都不服管了，不就乱了营了吗？
    现在明白啦，一整风，大家都出头说话了，也常跟干部们见面打交道了，看看干部们真心办事听话，我就懂啦：不是干部不让管，是咱们过去不敢管哪。合着咱们的民主就是这么回事：咱们选了代表，代表咱们管事，这自然也要管各家各户；可是，咱们也管得着他。就这么着，干部也管咱们，咱们也管干部。这就叫众人事众人管。这不就是平等吗！” 
    大妈年岁大，经历的多，别看这么点道理，明白过来也还不容易。我把这当家常话说一说，对另一些婶婶大妈的也许会有点帮助吧！
