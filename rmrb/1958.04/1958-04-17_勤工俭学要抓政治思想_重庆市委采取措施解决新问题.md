Grasp Political Ideology in Work-Study Programs
Chongqing Municipal Party Committee Takes Measures to Solve New Problems

(Our reporter Liao Yongxiang reports) The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee and the Party committees of various universities and colleges have taken timely measures to solve some new problems in implementing the work-study program policy.

Since March, Chongqing's universities and colleges have vigorously implemented the work-study and thrift-study policy, with anti-waste and anti-conservatism as the guiding principles. The mental outlook of teachers and students has undergone profound changes. However, since the work-study program was launched rapidly and vigorously during the Great Leap Forward, in-depth ideological education has not kept up, and many people still lack a correct and profound understanding of the political significance and purpose of work-study programs. In the formulated plans, more consideration was given to economic factors, and generally insufficient attention was paid to how to transform the thinking of teachers and students, improve the quality of teaching, and cultivate talents who are both red and expert through work-study programs. Some students mistakenly believe that participating in work-study programs is only for "learning skills and finding pocket money," and are willing to participate in paid labor, but are not interested in voluntary labor. Some schools have not properly arranged production and study, which affects teachers' ability to prepare lessons well and students' ability to review their lessons well.

In order to solve these problems, the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee held an on-site meeting attended by the heads of various universities, colleges, and scientific research institutes, and promptly put forward the principles for solving the problems. The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee pointed out that schools are places for cultivating talents and cannot be regarded as the same as factories. The central issue for schools is to improve the quality of teaching and cultivate talents who are both red and expert, and all work is for the purpose of achieving this goal. Therefore, the main purpose of schools carrying out work-study programs is to solve the problem of teaching being divorced from reality, teachers and students being divorced from workers and peasants, and neglecting physical labor, and to fundamentally establish the position and viewpoint of the working class. If economic benefits are regarded as the main gain, it is putting the cart before the horse. The Municipal Party Committee requires all schools to focus on political ideology when implementing the work-study program policy, and economic gains are only a byproduct of it. At present, the biggest waste in schools is that the talents cultivated are not both red and expert. It is necessary for all schools to oppose material waste and try various ways to save funds. However, more importantly, the "double anti" (anti-waste and anti-conservatism) campaign should be deepened in teaching, to find out the problems in teaching principles, teaching methods, and leadership ideology, and to find out the contradictions between teachers in teaching and students in learning, and solve them. This is the theme and core of the school's "double anti" movement. Regarding issues such as reducing food expenses, scholarships, and striving for financial self-sufficiency, the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee pointed out that it is necessary to be realistic and not excessive, and to ensure both the quality of teaching and participation in physical labor. The two should be well combined and promote each other, and the improvement of teaching quality should not be relaxed because of physical labor.

Regarding the organization of student labor in work-study programs, all schools have generally organized collective labor and prohibited students from engaging in individual labor on the streets, according to the instructions of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee. Students participating in labor such as shining shoes, washing clothes, and hairdressing is beneficial for eliminating squeamishness and cultivating labor viewpoints, but it is also limited to serving teachers and students of the school within the school. As for how to combine school education with labor production and how to ensure that teaching and labor do not interfere with each other when there are more production projects, many schools have made changes to the teaching plans according to their own characteristics. The Southwest Agricultural College has adopted a method of combining internships with production, with students spending half a day in class and half a day participating in agricultural labor. The Chongqing Institute of Architectural Engineering has adopted a method of concentrating on studying for a period of time and concentrating on laboring for a period of time. These methods need to be further improved.

    勤工俭学要抓政治思想
    重庆市委采取措施解决新问题
    本报讯　记者廖永祥报道：中共重庆市委和各高等学校党委及时采取措施，解决贯彻勤工俭学方针中的一些新问题。
    重庆各高等学校3月份以来，以反浪费、反对保守为纲，大力贯彻勤工俭学、勤俭办学方针，教师、学生的精神面貌都起了深刻变化。但由于勤工俭学活动是在大跃进中急速、猛烈地开展起来的，深入的思想教育跟不上，不少人对勤工俭学的政治意义、目的还缺乏正确、深刻的认识。在制订的规划中，从经济上考虑较多，对如何通过勤工俭学，改造教师和学生的思想，提高教学质量，培养又红又专的人才，一般注意不够。一部分学生误认为参加勤工俭学活动，只是为了“学技术，找零钱用”，愿意参加有偿劳动，对义务劳动不感兴趣。有的学校由于生产与学习安排不妥善，影响教师不能很好地备课，学生不能很好地复习功课。
    中共重庆市委为解决这些问题，召开了包括各高等学校、科学研究所负责人参加的现场会议，及时提出了解决问题的原则。中共重庆市委指出，学校是培养人才的地方，不能把学校和工厂一样看待；学校的中心问题是提高教学质量，培养又红又专的人才，一切工作都是为了达到这个目的。因此，学校开展勤工俭学活动，主要是解决教学脱离实际，教师、学生脱离工农，轻视体力劳动，从根本上树立工人阶级的立场和观点。如果把经济利益当成主要收获，则是本末倒置。市委要求各校贯彻勤工俭学方针，主要抓政治思想，经济收获只是它的副产品。目前学校最大的浪费是培养的人才不是又红又专。各校反对物质上的浪费，想各种办法节约资金，这是必要的；但更重要的，是要把双反深入到教学中去，找出教学方针、教学方法以及领导思想上的问题，找出教师在教学中、学生在学习中的矛盾，加以解决，这是学校双反运动的主题和核心。对于减少伙食费、助学金及争取经费自给等问题，中共重庆市委指出必须实事求是，不能过份，既要保证教学质量，又要参加体力劳动，二者应很好结合，互相促进，不能因为搞体力劳动而放松了教学质量的提高。
    关于勤工俭学活动中学生劳动的组织问题，各校根据中共重庆市委指示，一般都组织集体劳动，禁止学生在街上搞个体劳动。学生参加擦皮鞋、洗衣、理发等劳动，对打掉娇气，锻炼劳动观点等有好处，但也只限于在学校范围内为本校师生服务。至于生产项目较多，学校教育如何与劳动生产结合，教学和劳动做到两不误问题，不少学校已根据本校特点，在教学计划上作了改变。西南农学院采取了实习与生产结合进行的办法，学生半年上课，半天参加农业劳动。重庆建筑工程学院采取了集中一段时期学习，集中一段时期劳动的办法。这些办法都需进一步改进。
