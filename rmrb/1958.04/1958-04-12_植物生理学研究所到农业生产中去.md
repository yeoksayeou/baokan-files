The Institute of Plant Physiology is formulating a five-year research work plan for plant physiology and revising this year's research plan in accordance with the requirements of serving the great leap forward in agricultural production, striving for 70% of the research projects to be closely linked to agricultural production.

The institute has accepted the suggestion of researcher and mineral nutrition scientist Tang Yuwei and established a plant physiology working group to go to the key experimental fields led by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. They are determined to break with the past practice of mostly finding research topics from scientific literature, to broaden their horizons and find key problems in agricultural production practice, and assist in solving problems; through a long period of on-site study and work, they will find new directions for the development of plant physiology.

In addition to fully cooperating with the Department of Biology of Fudan University in plant physiology and microbiology teaching and research, the institute is also responsible for helping the Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry of the Ministry of Chemical Industry establish a microbial physiology laboratory to carry out research on increasing the unit yield of streptomycin.

    植物生理学研究所到农业生产中去
    植物生理研究所正在按照为农业生产大跃进服务的要求，着手制订植物生理学五年研究工作规划和修订今年的研究计划，争取有70％的研究项目密切联系农业生产。
    这个所已经接受研究员、矿质营养学家汤玉玮的建议，成立一个植物生理学工作组，到中共江苏省委领导的重点试验田去。他们决心打破过去那种多从科学文献上寻找研究题目的常规，到农业生产实践中去开拓眼界，寻找关键问题，协助解决问题；通过较长时期的现场学习和工作，找出发展植物生理学科的新方向。
    这个所除了和复旦大学生物系在植物生理学、微生物学教学和研究工作上实行全面协作外，还负责帮助化工部上海医药研究所建立微生物生理实验室，开展关于提高链霉素单位产量的研究。
