The Glorious Year of the Indonesian People
    Wan Feng
In the past year, the Indonesian people have waged a heroic and unyielding struggle to safeguard national independence and national unity, dealing a heavy blow to the colonialists. The glorious victory achieved by the Indonesian people in this struggle is also a contribution to the entire world's anti-colonialist struggle.

After the United Nations General Assembly finally rejected the West Irian issue proposal in November 1957, the Indonesian people became even more convinced that the United Nations, manipulated by the United States, could not solve the West Irian issue, and that only the Indonesian people themselves could determine the fate of West Irian. Under these circumstances, the Indonesian people's patriotic struggle to recover West Irian ushered in a new high tide. Massive mass rallies and demonstrations spread throughout the country. "Recover West Irian!" and "Expel the Dutch colonialists!" became the loudest fighting slogans. By early December, this struggle continued to develop, forming a powerful mass movement against Dutch colonial forces.

On December 2, under the leadership of the government, all Indonesian workers working in Dutch enterprises held a general strike, paralyzing the enterprises of Dutch monopoly capital. Subsequently, the government and military authorities announced the control of all Dutch enterprises (excluding oil enterprises jointly operated by the Netherlands and other countries) and Dutch plantations. Wherever there were Dutch firms, shops, factories, ships, and dock warehouses throughout the country, the employees organized themselves to take over. Takeover committees, financial supervision teams, factory protection teams, and so on sprang up like mushrooms. The Indonesian people's patriotic enthusiasm filled the country.

During the takeover movement, the Indonesian government took over all the largest Dutch and Dutch-Indonesian joint ventures (totaling more than 2,000 Dutch enterprises and 500 plantations). These included the Royal Rotterdam Lloyd, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, the five major trading companies, and the three major banks, as well as large Dutch enterprises such as the N.V. Hotel des Indes that sucked the marrow of the Indonesian people. In addition to taking over Dutch enterprises, the Indonesian government also decided to close Dutch consulates in various places, order unemployed Dutch people to leave the country, prohibit the publication and distribution of Dutch newspapers and periodicals, and prohibit Dutch airline planes from landing in Indonesia. All these measures effectively打击了 (dǎjīle - dealt a blow to) the remaining colonial forces of Dutch monopoly capital.

With the progress of the West Irian recovery movement, especially the control of Dutch business activities, the Indonesian people's anti-colonialist struggle further deepened. Imperialism naturally held a grudge. Western countries such as the United States and the Netherlands slandered and intimidated the Indonesian people in every possible way, and spread various pessimistic views in an attempt to create chaos. At the same time, U.S. imperialism colluded with national scum and reactionaries within Indonesia to carry out secessionist and subversive activities, and even attempted to assassinate President Sukarno. On February 15, 1958, under the behind-the-scenes manipulation of U.S. imperialism, rebels established a so-called "government" in Central Sumatra, openly creating division. Afterwards, U.S. imperialism adopted even more duplicitous tactics, backing the rebel group and putting pressure on the Indonesian government. Dulles repeatedly came forward to make remarks interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. Dulles also actively plotted interference in Indonesia's internal affairs at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Manila meeting held in mid-March. At the same time, the United States also dispatched the Seventh Fleet in the name of exercises to cheer on the rebels, and even airdropped weapons to the rebel group through the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Recently, U.S.-made B-26 military aircraft blatantly invaded the Makassar air base.

However, these interventions by U.S. imperialism did not deter the Indonesian people. The Indonesian people recognized that the rebels were imperialist agents against national independence, and that in order to defend national independence and unity, they must resolutely eliminate the rebel group. The Indonesian government, with the support of the people, took resolute measures against the rebel group. The government began military operations on March 10. Thanks to the support of the masses, the government forces won victory after victory. After the government forces recovered Padang on April 17, the main stronghold of the rebel group, Bukittinggi, was already in a desperate situation. The failure of the rebel group is a foregone conclusion. At present, while celebrating victory, the Indonesian people will raise the banner of the anti-colonialist struggle even higher and move forward. As President Sukarno said, 1958 is a year of no return, and the Indonesian people must fight resolutely!

    印度尼西亚人民光辉的一年
    万峰
    在过去的一年里，印度尼西亚人民为了维护民族独立和国家统一，进行了百折不挠的英勇斗争，给殖民主义者带来很大的打击。印度尼西亚人民在这个斗争中所取得的光辉胜利，也是对世界整个反殖民主义斗争的贡献。
    在1957年11月联合国大会最后否决了西伊里安问题提案以后，印度尼西亚人民就更加看透了美国所操纵的联合国决不能解决西伊里安问题，只有印度尼西亚人民自己才能决定西伊里安的命运。在这种情况下，印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的爱国斗争出现了新的高潮。声势浩大的群众集会和游行遍于全国。“收复西伊里安！”“驱逐荷兰殖民者！”成了最响亮的战斗口号。到了12月初，这个斗争更继续发展，形成了反对荷兰殖民势力的强大群众运动。
    12月2日在政府的领导下，所有在荷兰企业中工作的印度尼西亚工人举行了总罢工，使荷兰垄断资本的企业处于瘫痪状态。接着，政府和军事当局就宣布管制全部荷兰企业（荷兰和其他国家合营的石油企业除外）和荷兰种植园。全国各地只要哪里有荷兰的洋行、商店、工厂、船只和码头仓库，哪里的职工就组织起来实行接管。各地的接管委员会、财政监督小组、护厂队等等，有如雨后春笋一般纷纷建立起来。印度尼西亚人民的爱国主义热情洋溢全国。
    在接管运动中，印度尼西亚政府接管了所有最大的荷兰的及荷兰与印度尼西亚合营的企业（计有两千多家荷兰企业和五百个种植园）。其中有皇家轮船公司、皇家航空公司、五大洋行和三大银行，以及南洋旅馆等吸吮印度尼西亚人民膏脂的荷兰大企业。除了接管荷兰企业外，印度尼西亚政府还决定封闭各地的荷兰领事馆，命令无职业的荷兰人离境，禁止荷兰人报刊的出版和发行，以及禁止荷兰航空公司的飞机在印度尼西亚着陆。所有这一切措施都有力地打击了荷兰垄断资本的残余殖民势力。
    随着收复西伊里安运动，特别是管制荷兰企业活动的进展，印度尼西亚人民的反殖民主义斗争进一步深入了。帝国主义自然怀恨在心。美荷等西方国家，百般诬蔑、恐吓印度尼西亚人民，并散布各种悲观论调企图制造混乱局面。与此同时，美帝国主义与印度尼西亚内部的民族败类和反动分子勾结起来，进行分裂颠复活动，甚至妄图谋刺苏加诺总统。1958年2月15日在美帝国主义幕后操纵下，叛乱分子在中苏门答腊成立了所谓“政府”，公开制造分裂。之后，美帝国主义更采用两面三刀的手法，替叛乱集团撑腰，对印度尼西亚政府施加压力，杜勒斯不断出面发表干涉印度尼西亚内政的言论。杜勒斯更在3月中旬召开的东南亚集团马尼拉会议上积极策划干涉印度尼西亚的阴谋。同时，美国还出动第七舰队以演习为名，给叛乱分子打气，而且通过蒋介石集团空投武器给叛乱集团。最近美制B—26型的军用飞机，竟公然侵袭了望加锡空军基地。
    但是，美帝国主义的这些干涉，并没有吓退印度尼西亚人民。印度尼西亚人民认清了叛乱分子是反对民族独立的帝国主义代理人，为了捍卫国家的独立和统一，就必须坚决消灭叛乱集团。印度尼西亚政府在人民群众的拥护下，对叛乱集团采取了坚决的措施。从3月10日起政府开始了军事行动。由于得到人民群众支援，政府军节节胜利。到4月17日的政府军收复巴东以后，叛乱集团所盘踞的主要据点武吉丁宜已经陷于绝境。叛乱集团的失败已经是定局了。目前印度尼西亚人民在欢庆胜利的时候，将更高地举起反殖民主义斗争的旗帜前进。正如苏加诺总统所说的，1958年是决不能回头的一年，印度尼西亚人民要坚决斗争下去！
