A Countercurrent Stirred Up by West Germany
Xi Lingsheng

The West German Federal Parliament held a heated foreign policy debate from March 20 to 25. During the debate, the Adenauer government, disregarding the strong protests of the German people, used its manipulated parliamentary majority to pass a resolution to arm the West German army with atomic weapons. The resolution also insisted on including the reunification of Germany according to the West German government's conditions on the agenda of a summit meeting, and rejected the Soviet government's proposal to discuss the signing of a peace treaty with Germany at the summit. At the same time, the West German government also proposed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to revise the Brussels Treaty to allow West Germany to manufacture anti-tank missiles. After the end of the Federal Parliament debate, the West German Ministry of Defense immediately issued an order to accelerate the establishment of an atomic rocket base network in West Germany. This series of perverse actions by the Adenauer government is not only a serious provocation to the German people's desire for peace, but also to all peace-loving people in the world.

Currently, just as world public opinion is demanding an early East-West summit to eliminate the "Cold War"; just as the Soviet government's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe is gaining popularity; and just as the prospect of convening a summit is becoming increasingly hopeful due to the continuous efforts of the Soviet Union, the actions of the Adenauer government are actually intended to block the path towards easing the international situation. The West German government's intention to manufacture missile weapons, establish an atomic rocket base network, and arm the West German army with atomic weapons is to work with the United States to accelerate the transformation of West Germany into a source of atomic warfare, to exacerbate tensions in Europe, and to create obstacles for the summit meeting. Handing atomic weapons to German militarists who have launched two world wars will not only deepen the division of Germany and intensify the sharp confrontation in Europe, but will also create a serious new threat of war.

The Adenauer government's current actions cannot help but remind people of the role it played at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Paris meeting last December. At that time, Adenauer took the lead in expressing the "most disliked" proposal by the United States to negotiate with the Soviet Union, and demanded the postponement of discussions on the issue of the United States establishing missile launch bases in Europe, and so on. What is the reason for the two different attitudes displayed by the West German government in a period of more than three months? What is its intention?

Now it can be seen that Adenauer's attitude at the Paris meeting was entirely a pose. Its purpose was mainly to deal with the then US-British alliance, especially to deal with Britain's attempt to compete with West Germany for leadership in Europe. The Paris meeting faced a new situation in which the East wind prevailed over the West wind, and under this situation the leadership position of the United States in the imperialist camp was greatly weakened. In order to save the "leadership crisis," the United States had to make some concessions to Britain in order to strengthen the US-British alliance, while the past US-German axis was temporarily placed in a secondary position. The collusion between the United States and Britain aroused great dissatisfaction among West Germany, France, and other Western European continental countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Thus, West Germany, which had long yearned for European hegemony, tried to form some kind of continental front to counter the US-British alliance. In addition, the call for negotiations with the Soviet Union was very strong in Western Europe at that time. Reflected in the Paris meeting, many European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization also refused to rashly agree to the United States establishing atomic rocket bases on their territory, but demanded negotiations with the Soviet Union. For a time, the United States and Britain were in an isolated position. Seeing this situation, Adenauer catered to the general sentiment of Western European continental countries, took the lead in proposing negotiations with the Soviet Union, gained the support of these countries, and made Adenauer the "leader of the European movement" (Associated Press).

But since then, things have changed a lot.

The attitude of West Germany and other Western European countries at the Paris meeting had angered the Americans. After the Paris meeting, the United States exerted considerable pressure on West Germany and other Western European countries. Some influential American newspapers, under the instructions of those in power, launched a propaganda campaign "against Adenauer," forcing the West German government to immediately come out and express its "loyalty" to the West. Since then, the United States and West Germany have further colluded to accelerate atomic rearmament activities.

The recent successive visits to the United States by West German Defense Minister Strauss and Economic Minister Erhard are not accidental. These two visits facilitated many deals between the two sides. Strauss obtained from the United States missiles that could be fitted with atomic warheads and warships, aircraft, as well as West Germany's right to imitate American aircraft, and secured American support for the Franco-German-Italian arms alliance. Erhard discussed with the United States the issue of "cooperation" between the two countries in "assisting" underdeveloped countries. And when Strauss returned from the United States, Adenauer immediately issued a government policy statement in parliament, demanding that West Germany be armed with atomic weapons and insisting on including the issue of German reunification on the agenda of the summit meeting. Immediately afterwards, a spokesman for the US Army in West Germany announced: The US "Nike" missile bases in West Germany are ready for immediate use.

In the current international situation, the collusion between the United States and West Germany is for mutual benefit. For the US ruling clique, it is currently doing its utmost to obstruct the convening of a summit meeting. On the one hand, it is using the excuse of having to make full preparations, and proposing to include the issue of German reunification, which should not be interfered with by other countries at all, on the agenda, to delay the holding of the meeting; on the other hand, it is planning to establish American rocket bases in Central Europe and arm West German troops with atomic weapons, in order to create a fait accompli before the summit meeting, to undermine the prospect of the summit meeting and easing international tensions. In both of these aspects, the United States needs West Germany's support. From the West German government's point of view, it has long been ambitious to become an atomic power, in order to compete with Britain for hegemony in Europe. At the same time, West Germany's economic situation is not good, and West German monopoly capital is actively preparing to seek maximum profits from the development of the arms industry, especially the atomic arms industry. Therefore, the resolution passed by the West German Federal Parliament is actually a vicious step by the United States and West Germany to jointly undermine the East-West summit meeting.

The collusion between the United States and West Germany is a favorable condition for realizing West Germany's ambition to squeeze out Britain and dominate Europe. The United States' "help" and "cooperation" with West Germany in atomic weapons and "assisting" backward countries has obviously increased West Germany's capital to fight against Britain. And the United States' support for West Germany's "Common Market" and the Franco-German-Italian arms alliance has made Britain very alarmed. British Defense Minister Sandys's recent trip to Bonn was mainly to allow Britain to intervene in the Franco-German-Italian arms alliance to weaken West Germany's influence. But just as Britain's past participation in the Western European Union could not prevent the growth of West Germany's power in the Western European Union, this time it can only be a futile effort.

Now Adenauer's face of deliberately obstructing peace and poisoning the international atmosphere has been completely exposed. The Adenauer government's sinful actions that violate national interests have aroused the angry resistance of the West German people. In order to avoid a new war disaster, the broad masses of working people in West Germany have launched a struggle of unprecedented scale, the "Movement Against Atomic Death." Workers have launched spontaneous protest strikes, and the slogan of a national "general strike" is resounding everywhere. The West German Trade Union Federation, which has six million members, has decided to hold a national referendum and organize large-scale protest demonstrations. The West German Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party have also issued statements calling for Adenauer to step down. Abroad, the West German government's conspiracy to undermine the great power conference has also been strongly condemned by public opinion in various countries. Even Beaverbrook, an influential figure in the British Conservative Party, disagrees with the collusion between the United States and West Germany to undermine the great power conference. He said, "The British Empire should not allow German foreign policy or German wishes to influence its decisions." However, this countercurrent stirred up by the West German government cannot stop the trend of the German and even the world's people demanding peace, demanding the easing of international tensions, and demanding the abandonment of nuclear weapons.

    西德挑起的一股逆流
    席林生
    西德联邦议院在3月20日至25日举行了激烈的外交辩论。在辩论中，阿登纳政府悍然不顾德国人民的强烈抗议，利用它所操纵的议会多数，通过了一项以原子武器武装西德军队的决议。这个决议还坚持把按照西德政府的条件统一德国的问题列入最高级会议的议程，并拒绝苏联政府提出的在最高级会议上讨论签订对德和约的问题的建议。与此同时，西德政府又向北大西洋集团提出，要求修改布鲁塞尔条约，允许西德制造反坦克导弹。在联邦议院辩论结束以后，西德国防部立即发布命令，加速在西德建立原子火箭基地网。阿登纳政府这一系列的倒行逆施，不仅是对德国人民的和平愿望，而且是对全世界爱好和平人民的严重挑衅。
    目前，正当全世界舆论要求早日举行东西方最高级会议来消除“冷战”的时候；正当苏联政府提出的建立中欧无原子区的建议日益深入人心的时候；也正当由于苏联的不断努力使召开最高级会议的前景越来越有希望的时候，阿登纳政府的这种行动实际上是要堵塞国际局势走向和缓的通路。西德政府要制造导弹武器，建立原子火箭基地网，用原子武器武装西德军队，其目的是为了和美国一起加速把西德变为一个原子战争的策源地，来加剧欧洲的紧张局势，给最高级会议制造障碍。把原子武器交到曾经发动两次大战的德国军国主义者的手里，这不仅会加深德国的分裂，加剧欧洲尖锐对立的形势，而且会造成严重的新的战争威胁。
    阿登纳政府在目前的所作所为，不禁使人想起它在去年12月北大西洋集团巴黎会议上所曾经扮演过的角色。当时阿登纳带头发表了美国“最不喜欢”的同苏联进行谈判的主张，并要求推迟关于美国在欧洲建立导弹发射基地问题的讨论等等。在三个多月的时间内西德政府表现了前后两种不同的态度，这究竟是什么原因呢？它的意图何在呢？
    现在可以看清楚，阿登纳在巴黎会议上的态度完全是一种姿态。它的目的主要是为了对付当时的美英联盟，特别是对付英国跟西德争夺欧洲领导权的企图。巴黎会议面临着东风压倒西风的新形势，在这种形势下美国在帝国主义阵营里的领导地位被大大削弱。为了挽救“领导危机”，当时美国不得不对英国作了某些让步，以加强美英联盟，而对过去的美德轴心暂时放到了次要的地位。美英的勾结引起了西德、法国和其他西欧大陆上的北大西洋集团国家极大的不满。于是早已渴望欧洲霸权的西德就设法形成某种大陆阵线来对抗美英联盟。加上当时在西欧要求和苏联谈判的呼声又非常强烈，反映在巴黎会议上，不少北大西洋集团的欧洲成员国也拒绝贸然答应美国在自己领土上建立原子火箭基地，而要求和苏联进行谈判。一时使美英处于孤立的地位。看到这种情势，阿登纳投合西欧大陆国家的普遍情绪，抢先提出和苏联谈判的主张，获得了这些国家的支持，使阿登纳成了“欧洲运动的领袖”（美联社）。
    但是从那时以来事情已经起了不少的变化。
    西德和其他西欧国家在巴黎会议上的态度曾经激恼了美国人。在巴黎会议之后，美国就对西德以及其他西欧国家施加了不小的压力。美国的一些有影响的报纸在当权人物的授意下，展开了一场“反对阿登纳”的宣传运动。迫使西德政府不得不马上出来表示对西方的“忠诚”。从此，美国和西德就进一步勾结起来，加剧了原子备战的活动。
    最近西德国防部长施特劳斯和经济部长艾哈德连续访问美国，都不是偶然的。这两次访问促成了双方不少的买卖。施特劳斯从美国得到可以安装原子弹头的导弹和军舰、飞机以及西德仿造美国飞机的权利，并取得了美国对法、德、意三国军火同盟的支持。艾哈德则和美国讨论了两国“援助”不发达国家的“合作”问题。而当施特劳斯从美国回来之后，阿登纳立即在议会中发表政府政策声明，要求用原子武器武装西德并坚持把德国统一问题列入最高级会议议程。紧接着，美国驻西德陆军发言人又宣布：美国在西德的“奈克”导弹基地已经准备好随时可供使用。
    在目前的国际形势下，美国和西德的勾结，是为了相互利用。对美国统治集团来说，目前它正在竭力阻挠最高级会议的召开。它一方面借口必须进行充分的准备，并提出要把完全不应由其他国家干预的德国统一问题列入议程，来拖延会议的举行另一方面策划在中欧建立美国的火箭基地并以原子武器武装西德部队，以便在大国会议以前造成既成事实，来破坏最高级会议和缓和国际紧张局势的前景。在这两个方面，美国都需要西德的支持。从西德政府方面来说，它早已野心勃勃地渴望成为一个原子大国，以便同英国争夺欧洲的霸权。同时西德的经济情况不妙，西德垄断资本正积极准备从发展军火工业，特别是原子军备工业来谋取最大限度的利润。因此西德联邦议院通过的决议实际上是美国和西德共同破坏东西方最高级会议的恶毒的步骤。
    美国和西德之间的勾结，对于实现西德排挤英国而称霸欧洲的野心是一个有利的条件。美国在原子武器方面和“援助”落后国家方面对西德的“帮助”和“合作”，显然增加了西德同英国斗争的本钱。而美国对西德的“共同市场”和法、德、意三国军火同盟的支持更使英国十分惊慌。英国国防部长桑迪斯最近到波恩的主要目的是要使英国插足于法、德、意三国军火同盟来削弱西德的影响。但是正像过去英国参加西欧联盟不能阻止西德在西欧联盟中势力的增长一样，这一次也只能是一番徒劳。
    现在阿登纳蓄意阻挠和平、毒化国际气氛的面目已彻底暴露。阿登纳政府违反民族利益的罪恶行为，激起了西德人民愤怒的反抗。为了避免一次新的战争灾祸，西德广大劳动人民展开了空前规模的“反对原子死亡运动”的斗争。工人们掀起自发的抗议罢工，到处都在响起全国“总罢工”的口号。拥有六百万会员的西德工会联合会已决定举行全民投票和组织大规模抗议示威。西德社会民主党和自由民主党也发表声明要阿登纳下台。在国外，西德政府破坏大国会议的阴谋也遭到各国公众舆论的强烈谴责。甚至英国保守党的有势力人物比维布鲁克也不同意美国和西德勾结破坏大国会议，他说：“不列颠帝国不应让德国的外交政策或德国的愿望来影响自己的决定”。不过，西德政府挑起的这股逆流，是阻挡不了德国以至全世界人民要求和平、要求缓和国际紧张局势和要求废弃核武器的潮流的。
