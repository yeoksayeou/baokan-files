Xinhua News Agency, April 28th dispatch from Moscow: A major storm occurred on the 25th in the area where the Soviet Antarctic scientific stations are located. This storm caused a rare sudden drop in air pressure and a sharp rise in temperature in Antarctica.

The storm not only hit the Soviet scientific bases "Mirny" and "Oasis" located on the Antarctic coast, but also affected the scientific stations "Pioneer," "Komsomolskaya," and "Sovetskaya" located inland. The "Vostok" scientific station, located in the area of the South Geomagnetic Pole, was also within the storm's range.

The lowest atmospheric pressure recorded at the "Mirny" scientific base that day was 945.5 millibars, the wind speed reached 32 meters per second, and the temperature suddenly rose to minus 3 degrees Celsius. The atmospheric pressure at the "Oasis" scientific station was 937.7 millibars, such a low atmospheric pressure was never encountered by the Soviet expedition in the Antarctic region. The wind speed in this scientific station area reached 56 to 60 meters per second (32.6 meters per second or more is equivalent to a force 12 "hurricane"), and the temperature rose to 0 degrees Celsius.

    气压突降气温剧升  南极发生大风暴
    据新华社28日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联的南极科学站所在地区25日出现了一次大风暴。这次风暴引起了南极罕见的气压突降和气温的急剧上升。
    这次大风暴不但袭击了在南极沿海地带的苏联科学基地“和平村”和“绿洲”科学站，而且波及了处在内陆地区的“少先队”、“共青团”和“苏维埃”等科学站。位于南地磁极区的“东方”科学站也在大风暴影响范围之内。
    “和平村”科学基地这天所记录的最低气压是九四五点五毫巴，大风每秒速度达三十二公尺，气温骤然上升到摄氏零下三度。“绿洲”科学站的大气压是九三七点七毫巴，这样低的大气压是苏联考察队在南极地区从来未遇到的。这个科学站地区的风速每秒达五十六尺至六十公尺（每秒三十二点六公尺以上即为十二级“飓风”），气温高达摄氏零度。
