    Hold on a Moment with “Certainty”

    Some cadres and farmers in Jiangsu, seeing that the wheat seedlings are doing quite well this year, feel confident about a good harvest. Thus, they have a saying of “certain harvest,” to express their relaxed mood and freedom from worry. However, this idea does not conform to the actual situation, and therefore it is incorrect. The actual situation is that the calm winter has just passed, and the eventful season has arrived: As soon as the weather warms up, we must guard against pests, guard against rain, guard against drought, and guard against frost. It can be seen that from now on, it is precisely the time for farmers in wheat-growing areas to be worried, rather than feeling "certain" in their hearts.

    Generally speaking, this year's wheat fields are fertile and well-watered, but we must not be paralyzed by complacency because of this. Agricultural activities are inextricably linked to the ever-changing natural conditions. This is the biggest difference between agricultural production and other productions, and it is also the most important point to pay attention to when leading rural work.

### 且慢“笃定”

    且慢“笃定”
    江苏有些干部和农民看到今年麦苗还不错，觉得丰收很有把握，于是就有“丰收笃定”的说法，以表明自己心情宽畅，高枕无忧。然而这种想法不符合实际情况，因此也就是不对的。实际的情况是平静的寒冬刚刚过去，多事的季节已经到来：天气一暖和，我们就要防备虫害，防备天雨，防备干旱，防备霜冻。可见，从现在开始，倒正是麦区农民提心吊胆的时候，而不是心中“笃定”的时候。
    今年的麦田一般说来肥大水足，然而决不能因此麻痹自满，因为农事活动在很大程度上同变化多端的自然条件有密不可分的联系。这是农业生产同其他生产最大的不同之点，也是领导农村工作最应当注意之点。
