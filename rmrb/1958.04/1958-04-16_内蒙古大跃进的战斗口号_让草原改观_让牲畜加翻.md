Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 15th April (Xinhua reporter, Miji Dorge reported): A new situation of great leap forward in animal husbandry is now taking shape on the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia.

　　This unprecedented large-scale Great Leap Forward has gradually formed in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as the working herdsmen have repeatedly overcome grassland wind and snow disasters. In particular, through socialist education in pastoral areas, the broad masses of herdsmen have improved their ideological awareness and have brought into play unparalleled enthusiasm. According to estimates by the animal husbandry department, although the Xilin Gol, Ulanqab, Chahar, and Zhaowuda grasslands have been hit by blizzards several times this year, something not seen in nearly 20 years, the number of livestock losses has decreased by more than one-third compared to the same period last year; the survival rate of the more than three million newborn young animals born throughout the region has also been above 95%. The people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region have thus realized the first great leap forward in animal husbandry production this year.

　　Immediately afterward, battle slogans of "Hard struggle for three years to change the face of the grasslands" and "Hard struggle for five years to increase the existing 20 million livestock to 40 million" were spread from the major grasslands and rural areas of Inner Mongolia. According to this requirement, Inner Mongolian herdsmen will achieve a net increase of more than 17.6 million livestock within five years, equivalent to 2.5 times the net increase of livestock in the Autonomous Region during the First Five-Year Plan period; the average annual increase will be 12.3%, which is 2.5 times more than the original planned net increase of 3.5% for the Autonomous Region this year.

　　Large-scale animal husbandry infrastructure construction has already begun on the grasslands. A large pastoral water conservancy work team, divided into 20 groups, has entered the grasslands. In addition to building several new mechanical water supply stations, seven small and medium-sized reservoirs, and grassland irrigation projects on the grasslands this year, they will also drill more than 400 machine wells and deep water tube wells. Mass pastoral water conservancy construction has also begun. Herdsmen throughout the region will drill 5,000 new wells this year, providing sufficient drinking water for 2.5 million livestock on waterless grasslands.

　　Improving livestock breeds is an important part of the Great Leap Forward in animal husbandry. This year, Inner Mongolia has determined to improve more than 2 million livestock, which is three times more than the total number of livestock improved by the Autonomous Region in the past seven years. At present, the animal husbandry department has established more than 1,500 breeding stations on the basis of the original 300 breeding stations; various places are training artificial insemination technicians. The region's 700 veterinary hospitals, quarantine teams, and animal husbandry and veterinary epidemic prevention stations are now also carrying out large-scale animal disease prevention and control work.

　　The Great Leap Forward in animal husbandry requires the rapid development of animal husbandry mechanization. This year, herdsmen in the Autonomous Region will receive support from industrial departments with more than 1,000 new types of animal husbandry machinery such as mowing machines, waterwheels, milk separators, and shearing machines. At present, more than 70 tractors and dozens of trucks are being transferred to pastoral areas to serve animal husbandry production. This year, the state's investment in basic animal husbandry construction in Inner Mongolia has also increased by 4.7 times compared to last year. These major constructions will not only enable the Autonomous Region's animal husbandry production to leap forward on a more stable foundation but will also rapidly change the face of the vast grasslands.

　　Inner Mongolia is a major animal husbandry base of the motherland. The number of livestock ranks first in the country, and the region has more than 800,000 square kilometers of natural pasture. Since liberation, the number of livestock here has increased by more than 1.7 times. During the First Five-Year Plan period alone, the herdsmen provided the country with more than one million livestock and a large number of animal products every year, supporting the country's socialist construction.

### 内蒙古大跃进的战斗口号——让草原改观　让牲畜加翻

    内蒙古大跃进的战斗口号——
    让草原改观　让牲畜加翻
    新华社呼和浩特15日电　新华社记者密吉德道尔基报道：一个畜牧业大跃进的新形势，目前已经在内蒙古广阔的草原上形成。
    这个空前规模的大跃进，是在自治区劳动牧民一次又一次的战胜草原风雪灾害中逐渐形成的。特别是经过牧区社会主义教育，广大牧民提高了思想觉悟，更发挥了无比的干劲。据畜牧部门估计，锡林郭勒、乌兰察布、察哈尔和昭乌达等大草原，今年虽曾多次受到了近二十年来所没有过的暴风雪的袭击，但各种牲畜的损失数却比去年同期减少了三分之一以上；全区接产下的三百多万头新生幼畜，成活率也都在95％以上。自治区各族牧民，就这样实现了今年畜牧业生产上的第一个大跃进。
    紧接着，从内蒙古各大草原和农村又传出“苦战三年，改变草原面貌”、“苦战五年，使现有二千多万头牲畜发展到四千万头”的战斗口号。按照这个要求，内蒙古牧民五年内将纯增一千七百六十多万头牲畜，相当于自治区在第一个五年计划期间纯增牲畜的二点五倍；平均每年递增12.3％，比今年自治区原订纯增3.5％，增加了二点五倍。
    草原上已经开始大规模的畜牧业基本建设。一支庞大的牧区水利工作队，分成二十个小组进入草原。他们今年除在草原上新建几个机械供水站、七个中小型水库和草原灌溉工程外，还打四百多眼机井和深水筒井。群众性的兴修牧区水利工作，也已经开始了，全区牧民今年要打五千眼新井，在无水草原上可使二百五十万头牲畜得到充足的饮水。
    改良牲畜品种，是畜牧业大跃进的重要一环。今年内蒙古确定要改良二百多万头牲畜，比自治区过去七年改良过的牲畜总数还要多三倍。现在，畜牧部门已在原有三百多个牲畜配种站的基础上，兴建一千五百多个配种站；各地正在训练人工授精技术员。全区的七百多个兽医院、检疫队和畜牧兽疫工作站，现在也已经进行大规模的兽疫防治工作。
    畜牧业的大跃进，要求畜牧业机械化迅速发展。今年自治区牧民将得到工业部门一千多台打搂草机、水车、牛奶分离机和剪毛机等新式牧业机械的支援。现在，七十多台拖拉机和数十辆汽车，正陆续调入牧区为牧业生产服务。今年国家拨给内蒙古畜牧业基本建设投资，也比去年增加了四点七倍。上述这些重大建设，不仅可以使自治区畜牧业生产在更加稳定的基础上向前跃进，而且将迅速改变广阔草原的面貌。
    内蒙古是祖国的一个主要畜牧业基地。牲畜头数占全国第一位，全区有八十多万平方公里的天然大牧场。解放后，这里的牲畜增长了一点七倍多，牧民们仅在第一个五年计划期间内，平均每年都给国家提供百万多头牲畜和大量的畜产品，支援了国家社会主义建设。
