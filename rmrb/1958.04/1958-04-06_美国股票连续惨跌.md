Xinhua News Agency, 5th. New York dispatch: American stock prices have been declining continuously recently. According to reports from American news agencies, industrial stocks and railway stocks have fallen for eight consecutive sessions. Within this week, the total price of various stocks has fallen by four billion US dollars. This week has therefore become the week with the largest price decline so far this year.

    An Associated Press dispatch stated that although the US Congress is accelerating the passage of "anti-recession" bills, "it has no significant effect on stock prices." "The estimate that corporate income and dividends will be poor in the first quarter of this year due to the economic downturn in the first three months of this year has a huge effect."

    The message also stated that many "bad news" on the economic front, such as: the further decline in the operating rate of steel companies, the decline in installment credit, the further decline in railway transportation volume, and the reduction in automobile production to the lowest point in six months, are all the "background" for this stock price decline.

    美国股票连续惨跌
    新华社5日讯  纽约消息：美国股票价格最近连续下跌。据美国通讯社报道，工业股票和铁路股票已经连续下跌八市。本星期内，各种股票总价格共跌去了四十亿美元。本星期因而成为今年以来价格下跌幅度最大的一个星期。
    美联社一条消息说，尽管美国国会加速通过“反衰退”法案，“它却对股票价格没有重要效果”。“由于今年头三个月企业萧条因而预料今年第一季度（企业）收入和股息情况不好的这种估计，却有巨大的效果”。
    这条消息还说，经济方面的许多“坏消息”，例如：钢铁企业开工率进一步下降，分期付款信贷开始下降，铁路运输量进一步下降，汽车生产将减少到六个月来的最低点等，都是这次股票价格下跌的“背景”。
