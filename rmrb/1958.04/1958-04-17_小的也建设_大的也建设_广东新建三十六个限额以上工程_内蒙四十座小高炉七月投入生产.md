Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: While vigorously developing small and medium-sized factories and mines, Guangdong Province is also building a number of large-scale factories and mines, mainly in raw material industries and heavy industry. There are a total of 36 above-quota projects being newly built or already under construction this year. After the completion of these projects, Guangdong Province, which has always been dominated by light industry, will establish a certain heavy industrial base and begin to change its past situation of weak and incomplete industrial foundations.

The vast majority of these 36 construction projects are unprecedented in the history of Guangdong Province. Among them are the Maoming Shale Oil Joint Enterprise, which is under construction, an oil refinery, coal mines, steel plants, and hydroelectric power stations. The Qu Ren Coal Mine, which will start construction this year, can produce 300,000 tons of coal annually after completion, and will be partially put into production by the end of the year. The Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant, which is under construction, will be able to produce 140,000 tons of pig iron, 50,000 tons of steel, and 40,000 tons of steel products annually after the completion of the first phase of the project. The huge Xin Fengjiang Hydropower Station will also start construction in May, which will play an important role in solving the province's power shortage and developing industrial production. The situation of extremely weak fertilizer industry foundation in the past will also undergo major changes this year. After the completion of the newly built Guangzhou Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant and Zhanjiang Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, they can produce 210,000 tons of ammonium sulfate and 200,000 tons of superphosphate annually. In addition, the Xicun Cement Plant with an annual output of 500,000 tons will also be expanded.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 16th: Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is preparing to build a number of small blast furnaces, of which 40 will be completed and put into production in July this year.

Inner Mongolia is rich in iron ore resources and widely distributed. According to preliminary surveys by the geological department, the iron ore reserves in the Sunite Right Banner and Sunite Left Banner area alone can supply a steel joint enterprise with an annual output of 100,000 tons for fifty years.

    小的也建设　大的也建设
    广东新建三十六个限额以上工程
    内蒙四十座小高炉七月投入生产
    据新华社广州16日电　广东省在大力发展中小型厂矿的同时，正在兴建一批以原材料工业和重工业为主的大型厂矿。今年内新建和已在建设中的限额以上的项目共有三十六个。这些工程建成后，将使一向以轻工业为主的广东省，建立起一定的重工业基础，开始改变过去工业基础薄弱、残缺不全的面貌。
    这三十六个建设项目，绝大部分是广东省历史上从来没有过的。其中有正在建设中的茂名页岩油联合企业，有炼油厂，有煤矿，有钢铁厂，有水电站。今年内动工的曲仁煤矿，建成后每年可以产煤三十万吨，年底就将部分投入生产；正在建设的广州钢铁厂，第一期工程完成后就可年产生铁十四万吨，钢五万吨，钢材四万吨；规模巨大的新丰江水力发电站也将在5月份动工，建成后对解决省内电力供应不足和发展工业生产有着重要的作用；过去化肥工业基础异常薄弱的状况也将在今年内有重大的改变，新建的广州氮肥厂和湛江磷肥厂建成后，每年可以生产硫酸铵二十一万吨，过磷酸钙二十万吨。此外，还将扩建年产五十万吨的西村水泥厂等。
    据新华社呼和浩特16日电　内蒙古自治区正在筹建一批小高炉，其中有四十座在今年7月份就可以建成投入生产。
    内蒙古铁矿资源丰富，分布也广。据地质部门初步普查，仅苏尼特右旗和苏尼特左旗一带的铁矿储量，就可以供一座年产十万吨的钢铁联合企业开采五十年。
