Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th: Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delivered a "Government Work Report" lasting more than four hours at the eighth session of the Vietnamese National Assembly, which began today.

    Pham Van Dong first pointed out that the convening of this National Assembly session is of great significance. It marks the end of the economic recovery period in Vietnam and the beginning of a period of developing and improving the national economy in a socialist direction. It is the start of a new revolutionary movement in Vietnam.

    Pham Van Dong pointed out that in the past three years, the people of North Vietnam have completed two basic tasks: (1) basically completing land reform; (2) restoring the economy and initially developing culture. In terms of land reform, each agricultural resident now has an average of 1,498 square meters of land. In terms of economic recovery, the grain output in the North has increased from 2.4 million tons before the war to nearly 4 million tons. Significant achievements have also been made in industry, commerce, finance, and culture, resulting in a gradual improvement in the people's lives. He said that these achievements illustrate the correctness of the Party's political and revolutionary line.

    Pham Van Dong emphasized that in order to develop the national economy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in a socialist direction, it is first necessary to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. He said that we cannot allow the capitalist economy to run wild freely but must gradually restrict and transform it. He pointed out that in order to rapidly develop the agricultural economy, it is necessary to resolutely take the road of collectivization.

    When talking about strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship, Pham Van Dong pointed out that we must strengthen the dictatorship and the leadership of the Party in the future; only in this way can we guarantee the victory of the socialist cause. Based on the experience of the past three years, we must strengthen centralization while expanding democracy in the future. Pham Van Dong's words were interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

    Pham Van Dong said that in the future, a system of decentralized management will be implemented in economic management to avoid excessive centralization of power in the central government.

    When discussing the issue of Vietnam's reunification, Pham Van Dong pointed out that the most fundamental task of the entire Vietnamese people at present is to drive the American interventionists out of South Vietnam and achieve national reunification. He said that our policy is to unite all those in our country who can be united, to unite with the people of all countries in the world, to consolidate and strengthen the North, to consolidate and develop the patriotic forces in the South, and, in accordance with the Geneva Accords and under the supervision of the International Commission, to more actively carry out the struggle for the peaceful reunification of the country on the basis of independence and democracy. In order to implement this policy and to achieve consultation and general elections, we must fight to rebuild normal relations between the North and South and to achieve trade exchanges. At present, we must demand that the South Vietnamese authorities respond to the March 7th open letter from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Pham Van Dong said that for the Vietnamese people, the socialist camp is the most reliable supporting force for the cause of our country's reunification struggle. He said that in the cause of North Vietnam's advance towards socialism, we will constantly receive the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries.

    Pham Van Dong pointed out to the deputies that socialist countries are a system and must help each other and cooperate for common progress in order to guarantee their own independence and prosperity and to jointly conduct peaceful competition with the capitalist system.

    When discussing the international situation, Pham Van Dong said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam supports the Soviet Union's initiative to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing. He pointed out that an economic crisis is currently enveloping the United States. The Soviet Union and world public opinion, including American public opinion, are demanding that the American government abandon the Cold War and end the arms race in order to seek peace. He said, "We hope that the United States and its aggressive blocs will carefully consider what Premier Zhou Enlai said at the National People's Congress of China in February this year: 'Now is the time for them to conduct a cool-headed consideration and make a wise choice.'" Pham Van Dong's words were repeatedly interrupted by applause.

    Pham Van Dong said that Chairman Mao Zedong's words during the Moscow conference of fraternal parties not long ago, that the current situation is one of "the East wind prevailing over the West wind," inspired the will of the Vietnamese and other oppressed peoples of the world to fight against imperialism and colonialism, and greatly strengthened their confidence in achieving final victory. The Vietnamese people warmly welcome Chairman Mao's meaningful words.

    范文同总理向国会作政府工作报告
    按社会主义方向发展国民经济
    号召全国人民赶走美国干涉者实现统一
    据新华社河内16日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同在今天开始举行的越南国会第八次会议上作了四个多小时的“政府工作报告”。
    范文同首先指出，这次国会会议的召开具有重大的意义。它结束了越南经济恢复时期，同时是按社会主义方向来发展和改善国民经济时期的开端。它是越南新的革命运动的开始。
    范文同指出，过去三年越南北方的人民已经完成了两项基本任务：（一）基本完成土地改革；（二）恢复了经济和初步发展了文化。在土地改革方面，目前平均每个农业人口有一千四百九十八平方公尺的土地。在恢复经济方面，北方的粮食产量已经从战前的二百四十万吨提高到近四百万吨。工业、商业、财政和文化等各方面的工作也取得了许多成绩，表现的结果是人民的生活已经有逐步的改善。他说，这些成绩的取得说明了党的政治路线和革命路线是正确的。
    范文同强调指出，为了使越南民主共和国的国民经济向社会主义的方向发展，首先就必须对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造。他说，我们不能让资本主义经济自由泛滥而要逐步限制、改造它。他指出，要使农业经济迅速发展就必须坚决走合作化道路。
    范文同在谈到关于加强人民民主专政时指出，我们今后要加强专政和党的领导；只有这样才能保证社会主义事业的胜利。根据过去三年的经验，今后在扩大民主的同时，必须加强集中。范文同的话为热烈的掌声所打断。
    范文同说，今后在管理经济工作中将实行分级管理的制度，以免权限过分集中于中央。
    在谈到越南的统一问题时，范文同指出，当前越南“全国人民最基本的任务是把美国干涉者赶出南越，实现国家的统一”。他说，我们的政策是团结我国一切可以团结的人，同世界各国人民团结一致，巩固和加强北方，巩固和发展南方爱国力量，根据日内瓦协议，在国际委员会的监督下，更积极地进行在独立和民主的基础上以和平方式统一国家的斗争。为了执行这一政策，为了实现协商和普选，我们必须为重建南北两方正常关系和实现贸易来往而斗争。目前，我们必须要求南越当局答复越南民主共和国方面3月7日的公开信。
    范文同说，对于越南人民来说，社会主义阵营是我国统一斗争事业的最可靠的支持力量。他说，在越南北方向社会主义迈进的事业中，我们将经常得到苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家的无私援助。
    范文同向议员们指出，社会主义各国是一个体系，必须互助合作共同进步，这样来保证本国的独立繁荣，并且共同来同资本主义体系进行和平竞赛。
    范文同在谈到国际形势的时候说，越南民主共和国政府支持苏联关于单方面停止核武器试验的倡议。他指出，目前经济危机正笼罩着美国。苏联和世界舆论，包括美国的舆论在内，都要求美国政府放弃冷战，结束军备竞赛，来谋求和平。他说，我们希望美国和它的侵略集团注意考虑周恩来总理今年2月间在中国人民代表大会上所说的话：“现在是它们进行冷静的考虑和作出明智的抉择的时候了。”范文同的话一再为掌声所打断。
    范文同说，毛泽东主席在不久以前各国兄弟党举行的莫斯科会议期间所说的目前的形势是“东风压倒西风”的话，鼓舞了越南和世界被压迫民族反对帝国主义、殖民主义的斗争意志，大大增强了他们取得最后胜利的信心。越南人民热烈欢迎毛主席这句富有意义的话。
