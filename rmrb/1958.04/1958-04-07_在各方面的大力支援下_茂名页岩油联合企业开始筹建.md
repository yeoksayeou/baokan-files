With Strong Support From All Sides
Maoming Shale Oil Joint Enterprise Begins Preparations for Construction

    (Our report) The Ministry of Petroleum Industry has begun preparations in Maoming, Guangdong, to build a huge shale oil joint enterprise. After the completion of the first phase of the project, the enterprise will be able to produce more than one million tons of crude oil for the country annually. It can also produce about 180,000 tons of fertilizer and other organic chemical products as by-products. The enterprise has received strong support from all sides in its construction preparation work.
    In order to support the construction of the Maoming Shale Oil Joint Enterprise, the Ministry of Coal Industry established an open-pit mine construction preparation office and transferred cadres and technical workers. The Shenyang Design Institute of the ministry has begun open-pit mine design and strives to supply shale in 1961. The China South Construction Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering plans to complete 80% to 90% of the 14 temporary construction projects of the construction base this year in order to prepare for the full-scale construction of the factory in the coming spring. The Ministry of Railways has decided to take measures to advance the opening of the Lianmao (Hechun to Maoming) branch line of the Lizhan Railway, which leads to the Maoming industrial area, by four months to August this year. In order to solve the water source for industrial water use, Guangdong Province has decided to start the construction of the Liangde Reservoir (with a storage capacity of 700 million cubic meters) for comprehensive utilization of industrial and agricultural irrigation one year ahead of schedule in 1958, which will be fully completed in the first half of next year. In addition to designing a water plant for Maoming, the Guangzhou Water Plant is also preparing to contract to train a group of experienced cadres and veteran technicians for the Maoming Water Plant and transfer them there. The large-scale mechanical and electrical plant will also be constructed in the fourth quarter of this year, and the Design Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building is accelerating its design. In order to cooperate with the putting into production of the mechanical and electrical plant in the second half of next year, the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee decided to transfer hundreds of veteran technicians from Guangzhou and other places to support it. Responsible comrades of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee also stated that they would guarantee the supply of daily necessities for the employees who will construct the Maoming industrial area.
    In order to effectively reduce the project cost of the joint enterprise, Guangdong Province has also decided to build small and medium-sized refractory material plants and shale water plants on the spot. It is estimated that these two plants will be completed in the first half of next year to meet the needs of furnace construction and construction.
    The Maoming Shale Oil Joint Enterprise Preparation Office is also preparing to further strengthen the experimental research on shale dry distillation. The experimental furnace has been put into trial operation on March 15. In addition to providing a basis for design and improving oil recovery rate in a short time, it can also train many technical workers to meet future production needs.
    Due to the careful calculation of the designers to implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and the fact that many equipment can be manufactured domestically, the total investment in the construction of this joint enterprise can be saved by about 30% compared with the original plan. At the same time, due to the by-products of fertilizer and organic synthetic products, it is economically reasonable to build a comprehensive utilization shale oil plant under the condition that resources are guaranteed. At present, this plant and mine are arranging to order large-scale equipment and train cadres and workers, and hope to get strong support from relevant departments.

    在各方面的大力支援下
    茂名页岩油联合企业开始筹建
    本报讯　石油工业部已开始在广东茂名筹建一座巨大的页岩油联合企业，这个企业的第一期工程建成后，每年将能为国家生产原油一百万吨以上；还可以生产十八万吨左右肥田粉及其他有机化学产品等副产品。这个企业在筹建工作中得到各方面的大力支援。
    为了支援筹建茂名页岩油联合企业，煤炭工业部成立了露天矿筹建处，并调集干部和技术工人，这个部的沈阳设计院已开始进行露天矿设计，争取在1961年供给页岩。建筑工程部中南建筑工程局为准备工厂在明春全面施工，计划在今年内完成施工基地十四项暂设工程的80％到90％的工作量。铁道部决定采取措施，将黎湛铁路通往茂名工业区的廉茂（河唇到茂名）支线提前四个月在今年8月份通车。为了解决工业用水的水源，广东省已经决定提前一年在1958年开始修建工业和农业灌溉综合利用的良德水库（库容量达七亿公方），明年上半年即可全部建成。广州市的自来水厂除了为茂名设计水厂外，还准备为茂名水厂包干培训并抽调一批有经验的干部及老技工。规模宏大的机电厂也将在今年四季施工，现正由第一机械工业部设计院在加速设计中。为了配合机电厂在明年下半年投入生产，广东省委决定从广州等地抽调几百名老技工来支援。广东省人民委员会负责同志还表示保证建设茂名工业区的职工们的生活供应。
    广东省为切实降低联合企业工程造价，还决定就地取材筹建中小型耐火材料厂及页岩水厂，这两个厂预计明年上半年可建成，以适应筑炉及建筑的需要。
    茂名页岩油联合企业筹建处还准备进一步加强页岩干淄的试验研究工作。试验炉已于3月15日开始试车，除在短时间内可提出设计的依据和提高采油率外，还可培训出不少技术工人，以适应将来生产的需要。
    由于设计人员的精打细算贯彻勤俭建国方针，及许多设备已能由国内制造，这个联合企业建设的总投资比原计划可节约30％左右。同时又由于副产肥田粉及有机合成产品，因此在资源有保证的条件下建设综合利用的页岩油厂在经济上是合理的。目前这个厂矿正在安排订制大型设备，培训干部工人，希望得到有关部门的大力支援。
