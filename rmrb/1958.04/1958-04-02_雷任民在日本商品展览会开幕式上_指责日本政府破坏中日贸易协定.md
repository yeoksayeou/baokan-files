Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 1st. The Japanese Commodity Exhibition, following Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, opened today at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Palace in Wuhan. Over four thousand people attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition.

    Eiichi Suketani, Vice President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and Chairman of the Board of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, said in his opening address that the Japanese Commodity Exhibition was being held in Wuhan as planned, even as the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement had encountered setbacks, and he expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for this friendship. He said that this exhibition, along with the Chinese Commodity Exhibitions to be held in Nagoya and Fukuoka, Japan, would enhance mutual understanding between Japan and China, expand trade between the two countries, and realize the common aspirations of the two peoples – the normalization of diplomatic relations and peaceful coexistence.

    Wang Kewen, Director of the Wuhan Branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said at the meeting that this exhibition would further promote trade relations between China and Japan and strengthen the friendship between the two peoples. The exhibition showcases many exquisite products, but many industrial products could not participate due to the "embargo" measures implemented by the Japanese government in following the United States. He hoped that through the efforts of the Japanese people and friends in the business community, such artificial restrictions could be completely eliminated in the end.

    Lei Renmin, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, also spoke at the meeting, saying that while celebrating the opening of the Wuhan Japanese Commodity Exhibition, it was necessary to point out that the Japanese government not only had not given support and guarantees to the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, but had instead adopted an attitude that actually undermined the agreement, and had issued a series of statements that violated the spirit of the agreement, thus hindering the realization of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. He said that with the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the development of trade relations between the two countries, the interference and obstruction of American imperialism, as well as the sabotage activities directed by Chiang Kai-shek's group, were also being strengthened. This policy of the US government of crudely interfering in Japan's internal affairs and undermining the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan has been and will continue to be resolutely opposed by the peoples of China and Japan. Lei Renmin concluded by saying that the development of Sino-Japanese trade is in the interests of the two peoples and is also the common aspiration of the two peoples. With the joint efforts of the two peoples, the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement will surely be realized, and the friendly relations between the two peoples will surely be continuously developed.

    The Wuhan Japanese Commodity Exhibition is sponsored by the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Japan-China Import and Export Association, and the Japan Parliamentary League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, with the assistance of the Wuhan Branch of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. The exhibition is divided into eight pavilions and three squares, including industry, electrical appliances, instruments, comprehensive technology, and textiles, with more than 22,000 kinds and more than 67,000 exhibits.

    Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade, and Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, sent congratulatory telegrams to the exhibition. Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and others also sent congratulatory telegrams to the exhibition.

    雷任民在日本商品展览会开幕式上
    指责日本政府破坏中日贸易协定
    新华社武汉1日电　日本商品展览会继北京、上海、广州之后，今天在武汉中苏友好宫开幕。有四千多人参加了展览会的开幕式。
    日本国际贸易促进协会副会长、日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一在开幕词中说，当第四次日中贸易协定的实施遭到挫折的时候，日本商品展览会按计划在武汉举行了开幕典礼，他对中国人民的这种友谊表示谢意。他说，这个展览会和将在日本名古屋和福冈两地举办的中国商品展览会，将增进日中两国之间的相互了解，扩大两国间的贸易，以实现两国人民的共同愿望——两国邦交的正常化与和平共处。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会武汉分会主任委员王克文在会上讲话说，这次展览会将进一步促进中日两国的贸易关系，加强两国人民的友谊。展览会展出了许多精致的产品，但由于日本政府追随美国执行的“禁运”措施，还有许多工业产品不能参加展出。他希望经过日本人民和工商界朋友们的努力，最后彻底消除这种人为的限制。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民也在会上讲话，他说，我们在庆祝武汉日本商品展览会开幕的时候，不得不指出日本政府对第四次中日贸易协定不但没有给予支持和保证，相反地采取了实际上是破坏这个协定的态度，发表了一连串违反协议精神的言论，使第四次中日贸易协定的实现受到阻碍。他说，随着第四次中日贸易协定的签定和我们两国间贸易关系的发展，美帝国主义的干涉、阻挠以及指使蒋介石集团进行的破坏活动，也正在加强。美国政府这种粗暴干涉日本内政和破坏中日两国人民间友好关系的政策，已经并且将继续受到中日两国人民的坚决反对。雷任民最后说，发展中日贸易符合两国人民的利益，也是两国人民的共同愿望。在两国人民的共同努力下，第四次中日贸易协定一定能够实现，两国人民的友好关系也一定能得到不断发展。
    武汉日本商品展览会是由日本国际贸易促进协会、日中输出入协会、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟三个团体主办的，中国国际贸易促进委员会武汉分会协助展出。展览会共分工业、电器、仪器、综合技术、纤维等八个馆和三个广场，包括二万二千多种、六万七千多件展品。
    对外贸易部部长叶季壮，中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸等给展览会发来了贺电。日本政府内阁首相岸信介等也给展览会拍来了贺电。
