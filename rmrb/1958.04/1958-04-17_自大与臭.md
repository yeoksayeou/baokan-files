    Arrogance and Stink
    Qi Xiang
    An old professor, during the "Double-Anti" movement, raised his awareness and realized his problem of arrogance. He suddenly understood and said, "Arrogance and stink differ by only a dot!"
    Arrogance and stink, not only in terms of the shape of the Chinese characters, differ by only a dot, but also in reality, they are indeed only a dot apart.
    Arrogance, one type is self-proclaimed greatness. Originally without any real ability, they boast and brag, being wildly arrogant. Their self-assessment is miles away from the public's opinion, so they are always out of place among the masses, and the result is bound to stink among the masses. A rightist element in a certain agency, originally unlearned and unskilled, liked to toss around Marxist-Leninist phrases, full of seemingly comprehensible philosophical terms, regarding himself as an expert and scholar. He was dissatisfied no matter what position he was placed in at the agency, as none was sufficient to fully utilize his talents. He was already stinking in the eyes of the masses without realizing it, until his dissatisfaction developed into a fall as a rightist element. It is clear that such arrogance is bound to be associated with stink.
    There is another type of person who, although having certain conditions for "greatness" and receiving some recognition among the masses, does not know humility and is simply arrogant, looking down on the masses. The result is bound to be alienation from the masses, and the masses will also alienate them. "When Xi Shi is covered in filth, everyone holds their noses and passes by." Isn't that stink? Even if you are a veritable expert and scholar, as long as you have bourgeois individualism, you will become stinky among the masses. Moreover, the result of thinking oneself great will lead to complacency, so the conditions for becoming "great" will gradually be lost. What is there left to be arrogant about?
    The People's Daily editorial on April 13th, "Make Bourgeois Individualism Stink," pointed out: "The dirty and stinking essence of bourgeois individualism must be exposed to the full light of day, so that this strong stench will make anyone hold their nose and turn away, thus awakening those who are anesthetized by bourgeois individualist thought." Recognizing the harm of arrogance, turning pride into humility, and eradicating individualism will gradually bring one closer to the masses, transforming stink into fragrance.

    自大与臭
    齐祥
    一位老教授在“双反”运动中提高了觉悟，认识到自己骄傲自大的毛病，忽有所悟地说道：“自大与臭，相差只不过一点而已！”
    自大与臭，不仅从汉字字形上来看，只不过一点的差别，从实际上来看，也确实相差只不过一点。
    自大，一种是自封的大。本来并没有什么本领，却自吹自擂，狂妄自大，自己的估价与群众的公评相去千里，因此置身群众之中总是格格不入，结果必然在群众中弄臭。某机关有一个右派分子，本来不学无术，却好搬弄马列主义词句，满口似通非通的哲学名词，自己俨然以专家学者自居，在机关中放在这位置上不满意，放在那个位置上也不足以尽其才，在群众中早已臭了还不自觉，直到发展不满情绪堕落成为右派分子而后已。这种自大的结果必然与臭相联系是很明显的。
    又有一种人，虽然有一定的“大”的条件，在群众中得到一定的承认，但不知谦虚，一味自高自大，瞧不起群众，其结果必然远离群众，群众也将远离了他。“西子蒙不洁，人皆掩鼻而过之”，还不是臭吗？尽管你是个名副其实的专家、学者，只要是有资产阶级个人主义，也会在群众中变臭的。何况，自以为了不起的结果，就会故步自封，所以成为“大”的条件也就会逐渐丧失，还有什么可以自大的呢？
    人民日报4月13日的社论“搞臭资产阶级的个人主义”里面指出：“必须把资产阶级个人主义的又脏又臭的本质摆到光天化日之下，让这种浓烈的臭气使任何人都掩鼻而去，这样才会使那些受资产阶级个人主义思想麻醉的人清醒过来。”认识到自大的危害，变骄傲为谦虚，肃清了个人主义，也就会逐渐靠拢群众，化臭为香了。
