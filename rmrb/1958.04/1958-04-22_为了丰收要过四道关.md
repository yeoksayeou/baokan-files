To Achieve a Bumper Harvest, We Must Overcome Four Obstacles

"Clear and bright follows the snow, Grain Rain ends the frost." Now the frost has basically passed, and the summer harvest crops have smoothly passed the wintering stage. Wheat and rapeseed are growing better than in previous years. The foundation for a bumper harvest is there, but it doesn't necessarily mean we're guaranteed one. According to the situation in various regions, we must overcome four obstacles to ensure a bumper harvest. The first obstacle is the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests; the second is drought resistance and flood drainage; the third is preventing lodging; and the fourth is timely harvesting.

In the past, people generally didn't pay much attention to these four obstacles. They thought that once the frost was over, everything would be fine. If they relaxed their thinking, the yield would not only fail to increase, but would sometimes suffer losses. In the 1956 wheat season, some areas failed to grasp the last obstacle, and suffered rain damage during harvesting, losing more than 5 billion catties. As a result, the national total output increased by only more than 4 billion catties compared with 1955. We should remember this lesson. This year's agricultural production has seen a new upsurge, and the current situation is very good. According to rough estimates, as long as we can overcome these four obstacles well, the yield per mu can be increased by at least 20 catties. In terms of the entire nation, this is a considerable figure. The main problem now is to fully mobilize the masses and rely on them, summon revolutionary vigor, and conscientiously take concrete measures in the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, to ensure a bumper harvest.

In terms of preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, this year this obstacle should be overcome more smoothly than in previous years. According to the forecast report of Henan Province, more than 20 million mu of wheat fields may be affected by wheat blossom midges this year. Wheat aphids and wheat spider mites are beginning to occur in Hubei, Anhui, Shanxi, Shaanxi and other provinces. There are ways to prevent and control these insect pests, and as long as the masses are well mobilized and pesticides and equipment are prepared, they can be eliminated. Some wheat and rapeseed diseases have also begun to occur in some areas, and we must conscientiously summarize the experience of the masses, do a good job in field management, and prevent and reduce diseases. Especially when crops are growing luxuriantly, late-stage management is very important. For example, those with yellow rust should pay attention to irrigation to supplement the water needed by the plants; in areas where stem rust and scab are prevalent, ditching and drainage should be done in advance to reduce the chance of disease. Lime-sulfur mixture is also effective against stem rust and can be tried. When rapeseed diseases occur, efforts should be concentrated on eliminating aphids. In short, there should be preventive measures for all kinds of plant diseases and insect pests. With prevention, we will be sure to put it out when there are plant diseases and insect pests.

Now there is little rain in the north, and drought has occurred in some areas. Many agricultural cooperatives are actively carrying out the struggle against drought. Hebei Province has put forward "Ensure the survival of seedlings without rain, and ensure a bumper harvest in drought," which is a bold statement full of confidence. As long as they can make full use of all water conservancy conditions and do their best, they can strive for a bumper harvest. In the south, many areas have made great achievements in ditching and drainage, creating favorable conditions for preventing waterlogging. However, the development of the work is still uneven and must be further strengthened. After the rain, we should also pay attention to cleaning the ditches regularly to ensure that the water is drained as soon as the rain stops. In the rainy areas of the south, as long as we grasp this one link, we can greatly increase the yield of wheat, rapeseed and other spring-flowering crops.

Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, all regions have made many efforts to strive for a bumper harvest of wheat. They have great confidence and sufficient energy, and most of the wheat seedlings are growing strong, and a bumper harvest is promising. However, a small number of wheat fields are in danger of lodging due to excessive fertilization and improper watering. In this case, irrigation should be controlled, topdressing should be stopped, growth conditions should be adjusted, and lodging should be prevented or reduced. Some places have proposed the practice of plowing every other row, which is inappropriate. If the phenomenon of crazy growth is serious, some leaves can be appropriately cut off without affecting the growth of wheat. These technologies can be mastered in various places, and there is no difficulty.

The last is the harvest, and it is still early to arrange it. However, because the wheat area is large, the maturity period is concentrated, and it is easy to suffer rain damage during harvesting, the masses have always regarded wheat harvesting as a serious struggle of "snatching food from the dragon's mouth." We have suffered a lot in this regard in recent years, and we have also gained a lot of experience. The main key is to strengthen ideological mobilization, prepare materials, rationally arrange agricultural work, and promptly harvest and thresh to ensure that the grains return home.

Before and after the harvest of summer crops, we should also pay attention to doing a good job in selecting and retaining seeds to prepare for next year's bumper harvest. Green manure must implement the principle of self-retaining seeds, and a certain area must be guaranteed not to be plowed.

There is still more than a month before the maturity of summer harvest crops. Wheat in the Yangtze River Basin has already eared and is grouting, and the Yellow River Basin is also jointing and pregnant with ears. Time is tight, and if any measure cannot keep up, the yield will be greatly affected. Therefore, we must pay close attention to all possible natural disasters, summon up revolutionary vigor, and seize grain from nature in a fighting posture. We hope that all regions and agricultural cooperatives will make full preparations for the arrival of the tense wheat harvest season as soon as possible, mobilize the whole people, invest in the summer harvest campaign, and ensure a bumper harvest.

### 为了丰收要过四道关

    为了丰收要过四道关
    “清明断雪，谷雨断霜”。现在霜冻基本过去，夏收作物已顺利渡过越冬阶段，小麦油菜比往年生长都好。丰收的基础是有了，但还并不等于说一定能够丰收。根据各地情况，要过四关才能确保丰收。第一关是防治病虫害；第二关是抗旱排涝；第三关是防止倒伏；第四关是及时收割。
    过去一般人对这四关不太注意。他们认为霜冻一过，就太平无事了；思想上一松懈，产量往往不仅不能再提高，有时还会受到损失。1956年麦季就是由于有些地区最后一关没有抓好，在收获时受到雨害，损失了五十多亿斤，结果全国总产量比1955年只增加四十多亿斤。这个经验教训应该记取。今年的农业生产出现了一个新的高潮，目前情况很好，据粗略估计，只要能把这四关过好，每亩至少可以增产二十斤。这样全国总算起来就是一个可观的数字。现在主要问题就是充分发动群众、依靠群众，鼓起革命干劲，以多、快、好、省的精神认真地采取若干具体措施，以确保丰收。
    从防治病虫害来说，今年这一关完全应该过得比往年顺利。根据河南省的预测报告，今年有二千多万亩麦田可能发生吸浆虫。湖北、安徽、山西、陕西等省小麦蚜虫及麦蜘蛛正开始发生。这些虫害是有办法防治的，只要群众发动好，准备好药械，就可以把它消灭。有些地区小麦、油菜病害也开始发生，要认真总结群众经验，做好田间管理，预防和减轻病害。特别是在作物生长繁茂的情况下，后期管理工作非常重要。比如，发生黄锈病的要注意灌水，以补充植株所需要的水分；在秆锈病和赤霉病流行的地区，事先要做好开沟排水工作，减少发病机会。石灰硫磺合剂对秆锈病也有效，可以试用。在油菜病害发生的时候，要集中力量消灭蚜虫。总之，对各种病虫害都应该有预防的措施。只要有了预防，遇到病虫害就一定有把握扑灭它。
    现在北方雨少，部分地区已发生旱象，许多农业社正在积极开展抗旱斗争。河北省提出“无雨保全苗，干旱保丰收”，这是充满了信心的豪语。他们只要能够充分利用一切水利条件，尽最大的努力，就可以争取丰收。在南方，许多地区开沟排水工作成绩很大，对于防治渍水，创造了有利条件。但工作发展还不平衡，必须进一步加强检查。雨后还要注意经常清沟，做到雨停水泄。在南方多雨地区，只要抓住这一个环节，就可以大大提高小麦、油菜及其他春花作物产量。
    在大跃进的形势下，各地对于争取小麦丰收已经做了许多努力，他们的信心大，干劲足，大部分麦苗生长健壮，丰收有望。但也有少数麦田因施肥过多，浇水不当，有疯长倒伏危险。发生这种情况的，应该控制灌水，停止追肥，调节生长条件，防止或减少倒伏现象。有些地方提出隔一行犁一行的作法，这是不妥当的。如果遇到疯长现象严重的，在不影响麦子生长的情况下，可以适当地剪掉一些叶片，这些技术各地都能掌握，并没有什么困难。
    最后是收割的一关，目前时间还早，不必忙于布置。但是因为小麦面积大，成熟期集中，收获时又容易遭受雨害，所以群众历来把收麦看成“龙口夺食”的严重斗争。这几年我们在这方面吃了不少亏，也得到不少经验。其中主要的关键就是要加强思想动员，做好物质准备，合理安排农活，及时抢收抢打，保证颗粒还家。
    在夏熟作物收获前后，还要注意做好选种留种工作，为明年丰收做好准备。绿肥要贯彻自留种的原则，必须保证一定面积不要翻耕。
    目前距离夏收作物的成熟期还有一个多月，长江流域小麦已经抽穗灌浆，黄河流域也正在拔节孕穗。时间紧迫，任何一个措施跟不上，都会使产量受到很大影响。因此，我们必须密切注意一切可能遭遇的自然灾害，鼓起革命干劲，以战斗的姿态，向自然界夺取粮食。我们希望各地区、各个农业社都要及早地为紧张的麦收季节的到来做好充分的准备，全民动员，投入夏收运动，确保丰产丰收。
