    Covenant for Protecting Flowers

    In our courtyard, there are several lilac trees. Because of their fragrant scent and attractive appearance, they are often stripped bare by people breaking off the branches.

    Grandma Wang from the east room is a person who loves flowers as much as her own life. She often argues with those who break off the flowers until her face turns red in order to protect these lilac trees. But what use is that? If the adults don't break them off, the children still will! Grandma Wang gets angry and shouts, "I'm going to chop them down!"

    No one expected that this rectification movement would also bring good luck to these flowers. Grandma Wang first posted a big-character poster saying, "We must cherish the lilac flowers." Then, the people in the courtyard also posted big-character posters one after another to express their support. So, at a courtyard group meeting, each household signed a "Covenant for Protecting Flowers." Even the children challenged each other, guaranteeing that they would never break off another branch. This made Grandma Wang very happy. She said to the lilac flowers, "You bloom well this year. The rectification led by the Communist Party has also brought you good luck."

    护花公约
    我们院子里，有几棵丁香，由于它气味清香、姿色诱人，所以常常被人折得秃头秃脑的。
    东屋王大妈，是个爱花如命的人，往往为保护这几棵丁香同折花的人争吵得面红耳赤，可是那有什么用呢，大人不折了，小孩子们却还要折！王大妈生气了，就直嚷着说，“我要把它砍了。”
    谁也没想到，这次整风运动也给这几棵花带来了好运，王大妈先贴出了一张“要爱护丁香花”的大字报，接着，同院的人也纷纷贴大字报表示赞成，于是在一次院的小组会上，各屋都订立了“护花公约”，连孩子们也互相挑战，保证决不再折一枝花。这一下可乐坏了王大妈，她朝着丁香花说：“你今年好好开吧，共产党所领导的整风也给你带来了好运”。
