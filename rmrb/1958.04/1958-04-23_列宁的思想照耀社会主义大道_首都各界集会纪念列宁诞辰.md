Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: People from all walks of life in the capital gathered at the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Cultural Center this evening to commemorate the 88th anniversary of Lenin's birth.

The commemoration meeting was presided over by Cao Jinghua, Vice President of the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Sudarikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, gave a report on commemorating Lenin at the meeting.

Sudarikov said: Comrade Lenin always watched the national liberation struggle of the Chinese people with great reverence and cheered for the initial victories of the Chinese people. He said that as early as 1900, Lenin published an article in the first issue of the Iskra (Spark) newspaper opposing the persecution of the Boxers by imperialism in China. In later years, Lenin repeatedly issued meaningful calls to support the Chinese revolutionary forces, firmly believing that the Chinese people would eventually embark on the road to freedom.

He also said that this year, the international prestige of the socialist system is constantly improving, the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries are more united, the further unity between socialist countries, and the world peace forces are more consolidated and increased, making the commemoration of Lenin's birth even more significant.

Sudarikov also elaborated on how the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are embodying Lenin's will, and how the light of Lenin's thought illuminates the path of all peoples towards peace, democracy, and socialism. He concluded by saying: The great ideas of Leninism are having an increasingly strong and tremendous impact on the destiny of mankind. This thought will inevitably achieve complete victory throughout the world.

The artistic film "The Ulyanov Family," about Lenin's revolutionary life as a teenager, was also screened at the meeting.

The Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Cultural Center also exhibited pictures of "The Great Lenin" in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Picture Exhibition window on Wangfujing Street and in the cultural center.

    列宁的思想照耀社会主义大道
    首都各界集会纪念列宁诞辰
    新华社22日讯　首都各界人士今晚在北京市中苏友好协会文化馆集会，纪念列宁诞生八十八周年。
    纪念会由北京市中苏友好协会副会长曹靖华主持。苏联驻中国大使馆参赞苏达利柯夫在会上作了关于纪念列宁的报告。
    苏达利柯夫说：列宁同志一向以极大的崇敬心情注视着中国人民所进行的民族解放斗争，并且对中国人民最初的胜利表示欢呼。他说，远在1900年列宁就在火星报第一期上发表文章反对帝国主义对中国义和团起义者们进行迫害。在以后的年代里，列宁不止一次地发表有意义的号召，支援中国革命力量，深信中国人民最后会走向自由的大道。
    他还说，今年在社会主义体系的国际威望不断提高，各国共产党和工人党的更加团结，社会主义各国之间进一步团结、世界和平力量更加巩固和增涨的情况下纪念列宁的诞辰，意义更为重大。
    苏达利柯夫还就苏联共产党领导的苏联人民怎样体现列宁的遗嘱、列宁思想的光芒照耀着各国人民走向和平、民主、社会主义的道路等问题进行了阐述。他最后说：列宁主义的伟大思想对人类命运发生着越来越强烈和巨大的影响。这个思想不可避免地要在全世界取得完全的胜利。
    会上还放映了有关列宁青少年时代革命生活的艺术影片——“乌里扬诺夫一家”。
    北京市中苏友好协会文化馆还在王府井中苏友好图片展览橱窗和文化馆里展出了“伟大的列宁”的图片。
