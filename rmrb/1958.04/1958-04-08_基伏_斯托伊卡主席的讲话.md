Comrade Premier, Comrades, Friends,

First of all, I want to express the special excitement I have felt every day during my visit to your country. This feeling arises from being in contact with the inspiring reality and the enthusiastic builders of New China here.

During this visit, we have had the opportunity to learn about many of the remarkable achievements of People's China. The achievements that the Chinese people have made in socialist transformation and in the development of industry, agriculture, science, and technology in the years since the founding of the Republic are deeply admired by peace-loving and progressive people all over the world. On behalf of all the Romanian people, we wish you even greater success in the great cause of transforming China into a socialist industrial power.

Please allow me to express my great satisfaction that we were able to meet with Chairman Mao Zedong, with you, Comrade Premier, and other outstanding leaders of the People's Republic of China. We also note with satisfaction that the talks we held with the leaders of People's China were very sincere and fruitful. These talks reflect our two countries' determination to continue to develop our friendly and cooperative relations. The solid ties between Romania and China in politics, economics, science, technology, culture and other fields contribute to achieving the great goals that equally inspire our two peoples—building socialism, expanding international cooperation, and defending peace.

The talks we have held demonstrate that the two sides have a completely identical view on current political issues. Our two countries are determined to make a full contribution to the consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The unity of the socialist camp is a guarantee for the smooth socialist construction of the countries comprising the socialist camp, and a pillar of peace and the security of all peoples.

The talks between us also reflect our unwavering adherence to the principle of peaceful coexistence with all countries, regardless of their social systems, and reflect our common will to contribute to easing international tensions and resolving international issues peacefully and in a spirit of mutual understanding. It is for this reason that our two governments firmly support the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a summit conference. An increasing number of peace-loving countries and an increasingly broad world public opinion advocate such a conference.

At present, one of the most urgent issues is the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. The resolution of this issue is firmly demanded by the vast majority of mankind. We welcome the extremely important resolution of the Soviet Union to unilaterally cease testing any atomic and hydrogen bombs, and we see it as a major contribution to achieving this goal, thereby freeing ourselves from the threat of atomic war and safeguarding peace. Our two countries firmly support the struggle of the peoples of all countries for national independence against colonialism.

The Romanian people highly appreciate the peace-loving foreign policy of the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China is firmly promoting the principles of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation. The prestige and influence of People's China, this great world power, is constantly growing throughout the world, and any conspiracy by groups opposing the easing of tensions cannot diminish your country's increasingly important role in maintaining and consolidating universal peace.

I propose a toast to the great Chinese people and the continuous prosperity of China,
to the eternal friendship between the Romanian and Chinese people,
to the unbreakable unity of the great socialist family,
to the victory of the cause of peace,
to Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and other leaders of the Chinese people,
to everyone's health!

### 基伏·斯托伊卡主席的讲话

专栏：

    基伏·斯托伊卡主席的讲话总理同志，同志们，朋友们，
    首先，我要表达在访问你们国家期间，每天感到的特别兴奋的心情，这种心情是由于在这里跟令人鼓舞的现实和新中国的热情建设者的接触而产生的。
    在这访问期间，我们有机会了解到人民中国的许多显著的成绩。在共和国成立以来的几年内，中国人民在社会主义改造，工业、农业、科学技术发展方面所获得的成就，深为全世界爱好和平和进步的人们所赞扬。我们代表全体罗马尼亚人民，祝你们在把中国变成为一个社会主义工业大国的伟大事业中获得更大的成就。
    请允许我表达十分满意的心情，因为我们能有机会跟毛泽东主席，跟您总理同志和其他杰出的中华人民共和国领导人会见。我们同样以满意的心情，体会到跟人民中国的领袖们所进行的会谈是很诚挚的和富有成果的。这些会谈体现了我们两国决心继续发展我们之间的友好合作关系。罗中两国在政治、经济、科学、技术、文化等多方面的巩固的联系，对达到同样鼓舞我们两国人民的伟大目标——建设社会主义，扩大国际合作，保卫和平——作出贡献。
    我们进行的会谈表明，双方对目前政治问题具有完全一致的看法。我们两国决心要对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结的巩固作出全部贡献。社会主义阵营的团结是组成社会主义阵营各国顺利进行社会主义建设的保证，是和平和各国人民安全的支柱。
    我们之间的会谈也反映了我们对与各国和平共处的原则的不可动摇的拥护，不论它们的社会制度如何，反映了我们共同的意志，即对缓和国际紧张局势和用和平方式、相互谅解精神来解决国际问题作出贡献。正因为此，我们两国政府坚决支持苏联关于召开最高级会议的建议。越来越多的爱好和平的国家以及越来越广泛的世界舆论界主张这样的会议。
    目前，最迫切的问题之一，是停止试验核武器。这种问题的解决是人类绝大部分所坚决要求的。我们欢迎苏联单方面停止试验任何原子弹和氢弹的极其重要的决议，并且把它看作是实现这个目的，从而摆脱原子战争威胁和保卫和平的重大贡献。我们两国坚决支持为争取和巩固民族独立的各国人民反对殖民主义的斗争。
    罗马尼亚人民对中华人民共和国的爱好和平的外交政策，给予很高的评价。中华人民共和国坚决促进和平共处和国际合作的原则。人民中国这个世界大国的威信和影响在全世界得到不断的增长，而反对缓和紧张局势的集团的任何阴谋不能缩小你们国家对维护和巩固普遍和平方面显得越来越重要的作用。
    我建议为伟大的中国人民和中国的不断繁荣，
    为罗中两国人民之间的永恒友谊，
    为社会主义国家大家庭的牢不可破的团结，
    为和平事业的胜利，
    为毛泽东主席、周恩来总理和其他中国人民的领袖们，
    为大家的健康，干杯！（附图片）
