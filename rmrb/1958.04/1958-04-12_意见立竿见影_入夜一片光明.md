    Suggestions Produce Immediate Results; The Night Becomes Bright
    In front of No. 9 Zhong Xiucai Hutong in the Xisi District of Beijing, there was a telephone pole, but no light. At night, the area was pitch black, which was very inconvenient.
    At the residents' rectification group meeting, Sun Dejuan, the leader of the second rectification group, said: "If a light is installed on this telephone pole, it will not only benefit the nearby residents but also the passing pedestrians and vehicles."
    Two days later, in the evening, the telephone pole in front of No. 9 was emitting bright light. Li Wen, who lived in this courtyard, happily ran out several times to look at the street lamp. This street lamp also attracted the neighbors, and the more people looked at it, the brighter they felt in their hearts.

    意见立竿见影  入夜一片光明
    北京市西四区中秀才胡同九号门前，有一根电线杆子，可是没有灯。到了晚上，这块地方漆黑一片，很不方便。
    在居民整风小组会上，整风第二小组长孙德娟说：“只要在这根电线杆子上安个灯，不但对附近居民有好处，对过往行人和车辆都有好处。”
    两天以后的晚上，九号门前的电线杆子上，发射着亮亮的灯光。住在这院里的李雯，高兴得跑出来好几回看这盏路灯。这盏路灯，把街坊们也吸引出来了，人们越看，心里越感到亮堂。
