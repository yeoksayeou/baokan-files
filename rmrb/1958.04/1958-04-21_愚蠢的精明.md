    “Foolish Cleverness”
    The outgoing Minister of Defense of the Gaillard cabinet, Chaban-Delmas, is still boasting about his method of reorganizing the French armed forces. He talked about several goals of taking this measure, one of which is to "guarantee France's power overseas for a long time," and the other is to "have more assurance and more access to...weapons from our allies."
    To put it more plainly, it means: France wants to resolutely continue its colonial war; if it doesn't have enough weapons, it will ask its "allies" -- mainly the United States, of course -- for them. This calculation is quite clever. However, Chaban-Delmas seems to have forgotten the current reality: the United States supplies France with weapons to fight colonial wars not for the benefit of France, but to create opportunities to replace France's position. Isn't this the reason why the Gaillard cabinet collapsed?
    Chaban-Delmas complacently displays his "cleverness," but what people see in him is only "foolish cleverness."

    “愚蠢的精明”
    马上就要卸任的盖伊阿内阁的国防部长沙邦—戴尔马还在吹嘘他的改组法国武装部队办法。他谈到了采取这项措施的几个目的，其一是“长期保证法国在海外的势力”，其二是“更有把握和更多地从我们的盟国那里得到……武器”。
    把话说得更明白一些，那就是：法国要把殖民战争坚决打下去；武器不够就向“盟国”——当然主要是美国——要。这个算盘是打得颇为精明的。可是，沙邦—戴尔马似乎忘了眼前的事实：美国供给法国武器打殖民战争决不是为了法国的利益，而是为了制造机会来取代法国的地位。盖伊阿内阁之所以垮台，不正是这个缘故吗？
    沙邦—戴尔马洋洋得意地表现自己的“精明”，而人们在他身上看到的却是“愚蠢的精明”而已。
