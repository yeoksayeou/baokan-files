Xinhua News Agency, London, 27th: Hunger forced an eighty-year-old man in Britain to become a thief.

The old man, George Smith, admitted in court that, having not had a meal for two consecutive days, he stole about thirty shillings worth of items from his landlord, hoping to sell them to buy some food.

The police indictment stated that the old man had "served the country well." Since retiring ten years ago, he has been living on a meager pension, and finally, in his old age of eighty, he was forced to become a thief.

    英国社会制造饥饿
    八十老翁被迫盗窃
    据新华社27日讯　伦敦消息：饥饿迫使英国一个八十岁的老人成了盗窃犯。
    这个老人乔治·史密斯在法庭上承认，由于一连两天没有吃到一顿饭，他偷了他的房东的约值三十先令的东西，想把这些东西卖掉去买点食物。
    警察局的控告书说，这个老人曾经“很好地为国家效过力”。自从十年前退休以来，他只靠着极为菲薄的养老金过活，终于在八十岁的晚年被迫成为一个盗窃犯。
