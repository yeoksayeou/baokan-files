    Overcoming Pests and Diseases is the Key to a Bountiful Harvest
    (By our staff reporter) The season when crop pests and diseases begin to become active has arrived. A massive campaign to eliminate pests and diseases is about to unfold across the country.
    According to statistics from fourteen provinces, the planned area for pest and disease control this year has reached over 1 billion mu, doubling the national control area last year. The method for carrying out this work is: focusing on large-scale, thorough control to promote a comprehensive leap forward in control work. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-one provinces, large-scale, thorough control covers more than 210 million mu, a 35-fold increase compared to last year. This includes over 60 million mu for thorough control of rice pests and diseases, over 30 million mu for wheat pests and diseases, over 78 million mu for coarse grain pests and diseases, over 39 million mu for cotton pests and diseases, and over 6 million mu for other pests and diseases. Building on thorough control, the goal is to establish pest-and-disease-free counties, townships, and communes, striving to achieve a plan to eradicate a certain disease within a year.
    To ensure the realization of the leap forward targets, technical training is being conducted at all levels. Jiangsu, Hubei, and Shanxi provinces plan to train 1.29 million pest control technicians. The trainees include township and commune cadres, activists, model workers, and supply and marketing cooperative cadres. The pest control technicians are required to learn techniques such as pest inspection, pesticide application, machinery operation, and machinery repair.
    In terms of pesticides, the nation is expected to supply over 400,000 tons, and over 3 million pieces of agricultural machinery, an increase of three to four times compared to last year, with improved quality. Among them, the most popular "1059" will have a total supply of more than 800 tons throughout the year, a five-fold increase compared to last year, which can completely control 40 million mu of cotton aphids and spider mites. To solve the shortage of agricultural machinery, the vast cotton-growing areas are vigorously modifying existing single-tube sprayers and self-made small "1059" stem applicators.
    With the development of prevention and control work, provinces such as Henan, Shanxi, and Jiangsu have adopted leadership methods that adapt to the development of the situation. The Xinxiang Special Zone in Henan Province established pest control headquarters from top to bottom, with the prefectural party committee and the commissioner personally taking charge, and absorbing relevant departments. The deployment of prevention and control work: in March, focus on the preparation of pesticides and machinery; in April, complete training; at the end of April, the special zone and counties will conduct four checks across the board (check the preparation of pesticides and machinery, check personnel training, check ideological mobilization, and check safety education). Jiangsu Province sets up demonstration points at each level, carries out visits and comparisons, and compares preparations, progress, quality, and effectiveness in the preparation and action phases. The province prepares for two rounds of comparison, one in late March - early April, comparing the elimination of excessive pests and preparation work; and the other in September, comparing the prevention and control of rice and cotton pests. Shanxi Province focused on several major crops and convened five on-site leap forward conferences, organizing 30 counties in the cotton area for three-way joint prevention.
    Currently, some regions have not finalized their prevention and control plans, and some have not implemented them, mainly due to conservative thinking. These regions urgently need to reverse this phenomenon, speed up their pace, and catch up.

### 战胜病虫害才能得丰收

    战胜病虫害才能得丰收
    本报讯　农作物病虫害开始活动的季节已经来到了，一场声势浩大的歼灭病虫害战役即将在各地展开。
    今年防治病虫害计划面积，据十四个省统计，已达十亿多亩，比去年全国防治面积扩大一倍。进行这一工作的方法是：以大面积彻底防治为中心，推动防治工作全面跃进。据二十一个省不完全统计，大面积彻底防治共有二亿一千多万亩，比去年扩大三十五倍。其中彻底防治水稻病虫六千多万亩，麦类病虫三千多万亩，杂粮病虫七千八百多万亩、棉花病虫三千九百多万亩、其他病虫六百多万亩。在彻底防治的基础上，进一步提出建立无病虫县、乡、社，力争一年实现消灭某种病的规划。
    为了保证跃进指标的实现，各地正逐级进行技术传授。江苏、湖北、山西三省计划训练一百二十九万治虫技术员。训练对象有乡、社干部、积极分子、劳模及供销社干部等，要求治虫技术员学会查虫、用药、使械、修械等技术。
    在农药方面，全国预计可以供应四十余万吨、农械三百多万架，比去年增加三到四倍，质量也较好。其中最受欢迎的“1059”，全年将供应八百多吨，比去年增加五倍，可以彻底防治棉蚜、红蜘蛛四千万亩。广大棉区为了解决农械的不足，正大力改装旧有单管喷雾器和自制小型“1059”涂茎器。
    随着防治工作的开展，河南、山西、江苏等省采取与形势发展相适应的领导方法。河南新乡专区自上而下建立治虫指挥部，由地委和专员亲自挂帅，吸收各有关部门参加。防治工作部署：3月份抓药械准备，4月完成训练，4月底专、县全面进行四查（查药械准备、查人员训练、查思想发动、查安全教育）。江苏省层层设点示范，开展参观评比，在防治准备和行动阶段，比准备、比进度、比质量、比效果。全省准备评比两次，一次在3月下旬——4月上旬，比消灭过多害虫和准备工作；一次在9月，比防治水稻、棉花害虫。山西省抓住几个主要作物，召开了五个现场跃进会，在棉区组织三十个县分三片联防。
    目前，有些地区的防治计划没有确定下来，还有的没有贯彻下去，这主要是保守思想在作怪。这些地区亟待扭转这种现象，快马加鞭，迎头赶上。
