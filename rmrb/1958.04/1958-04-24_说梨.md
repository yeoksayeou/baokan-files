    Talking About Pears
    Cui Zhixue
    Spring is the off-season for fruits, but there are relatively more pears. There are yellow pears, oil pears, red winter pears, long-stem pears, sour pears, winter pears, etc., all available. In fact, pears are fruits harvested in autumn, but they are resistant to storage. After a season, they are still fresh, which can make up for the lack of fruits in spring.
    China has a long history of pear cultivation. As early as the book "Erya" more than two thousand years ago, there were records of pears. Now in China, from Shandong to Xinjiang, from Yunnan to Yanbian, there are excellent varieties of pears everywhere. Among the more than twenty kinds of pears in the world, China is the origin of as many as twelve kinds. The pears cultivated in China now mainly include the Qiu Zi pear, the Bai pear, and the Sha pear. The first two are mainly distributed north of the Yellow River and are more cold-resistant, while the latter is mainly cultivated in the Yangtze River basin.
    Among these types of pears, the best quality is the duck pear, a representative variety of the Bai pear. The duck pear has a smooth yellow skin, crisp and delicate flesh, juicy and sweet taste. It is widely distributed and very adaptable. It can grow in the mountains, and it can also grow in the sandy wasteland of the plains.
    Pear trees have a long lifespan. I have seen a hundred-year-old tree in Quyang County, Hebei Province, which is twenty-six feet high and has a crown diameter of more than thirty feet wide. It still has strong growth power, and it is full of white flowers in spring, which is exceptionally beautiful. Pear trees are not only long-lived but also prolific. In Guoxian County, Shanxi, there is a sixty-year-old yellow pear tree that once bore two thousand catties of fruit. In that area, many pear trees are planted in front and behind the mountains. In spring, looking from a high place, the eyes are full of snow-white pear blossoms. In autumn, it is “ten thousand yellow pear trees with golden branches drooping.”
    The nutritional value of pears is also quite good. The protein, fat, carotene, vitamin B, and C contained in them are all indispensable nutrients for the human body. Pear juice can be boiled into pear paste, which has the effect of moisturizing the throat and clearing phlegm.
    The annual output of pear trees in the country is about 500,000 tons, which is more than the total output of apples and oranges, but it is still not enough for the needs of the people and for export. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to accelerate the increase of the yield per unit area of ​​pear trees, and on the other hand, it is necessary to expand the planting of pear trees. As long as we pay attention to the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, fertilize them in early spring before budding, in summer and autumn, do not let the branches grow too densely, pay attention to cultivating and hoeing, and pay attention to moisture conservation in dry areas, the pear trees can bear fruit every year. As for the development of those varieties, each place has its own excellent varieties, which can be adopted locally. For example, the Ya pear and Xuehua pear in Hebei, the Qiubai pear in Liaoning and Hebei, the Laiyang pear and Changba pear in Shandong, the Dangshan pear in Jiangsu, and the Cangxi pear in Sichuan are all excellent varieties that our ancestors have cultivated and selected over many years.
    European pears have been introduced from foreign countries in the past 100 years. After trial planting, they have also become very delicious Chinese pears. For example, the European pears produced in Yantai, Shandong, were originally the world-famous Bartlett pears. This kind of pear has a particularly good flavor after being picked and softened, and is a top-quality pear, which is worth promoting and developing.

    说梨
    崔致学
    春天是水果上市的淡季，但是梨却较多。黄梨、油梨、红宵梨、长把梨、酸梨、冬果梨等等，应有尽有。其实梨是秋天收获的水果，只是耐贮藏，隔了一季，依然新鲜，正可以补春天水果的不足。
    我国栽培梨的历史很悠久，远在两千多年前的“尔雅”一书中，就有梨的记载了。现在在我国，从山东到新疆，从云南到延边，到处都有梨的优良品种。在全世界现有二十几种梨中，原产中国的就有十二种之多。现在我国栽培的梨主要有秋子梨、白梨、沙梨三种。前二种主要分布在黄河以北，比较耐寒，后一种主要栽培在长江流域。
    这几种梨中，质量最好的是白梨中的代表品种——鸭梨，鸭梨皮光色黄，肉脆而细，汁多味甜，分布地区较广，适应性很强，可以在山上生长，也可以在平原沙荒地里成长。
    梨树的寿命很长，我在河北省曲阳县看到过一百年生的大树，有两丈六尺高，树冠直径达三丈多宽，生长力还很强盛，春天满树白花，异常美丽。梨树不但长寿，而且丰产。在山西崞县有一株六十年生的黄梨，一次结过两千斤果实。那地方，山前山后种着很多梨树。春天，登高了望，满眼雪白的梨花。到了秋季，则是“黄梨万树金垂梢”。
    梨的营养价值也很不坏。其中所含蛋白质、脂肪、胡萝卜素、维生素乙、丙，都是人体中不可缺乏的营养物质。梨汁可以熬成梨膏，有润喉清痰的功效。
    全国梨树年产量约50万吨，比苹果和柑桔的总产量还要多些，但还是不够全国人民需要和出口。因此，一方面要加速提高梨树的单位面积产量，一方面要扩种梨树。只要注意防治病虫，在早春发芽前、夏季和秋季给它施肥，不要让枝条长得过密，注意耕锄，在旱干的地区注意保墒，就可以使梨树年年结果。至于发展那些品种，各地有各地的优良品种，可以就地采用。例如河北的鸭梨和雪花梨，辽宁和河北的秋白梨，山东的莱阳梨、长把梨，江苏的砀山梨，四川的苍溪梨等等，都是我们祖先经过多年栽培，选育出来的优良品种。
    洋梨是近百年来从国外引进的。经过试种，也变成了很可口的中国梨。如山东烟台出产的洋梨，原是世界上有名的巴梨。这种梨采下放软后，风味特佳，是梨中上品，值得推广发展。
