Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: According to sources in the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the United States, through its embassy in Japan, has protested to Japan regarding the signing of a soybean contract between China and Japan. It is understood that although the Japanese authorities know that the price of importing soybeans from China is much cheaper than importing them from the United States, they are still trying to obtain "understanding" from the United States, fearing American pressure.
