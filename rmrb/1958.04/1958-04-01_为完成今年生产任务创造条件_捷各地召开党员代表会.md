    Creating Conditions for Completing This Year's Production Tasks
    Party Representative Meetings Held in Various Locations in Czechoslovakia
    Under the slogan of completing socialist construction, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia convened party representative meetings in more than 200 counties and districts across the country in March. The meetings summarized the work of the past year and discussed the issues of realizing the reorganization of the national economy and improving agricultural production. Representatives from various places stated that they would use the party's political organizational work to create conditions for completing the second five-year plan and this year's production tasks.
    The county and district party congresses talked about the party's tasks under the new situation. The representatives pointed out that after the industrial reorganization, in order to better implement the party's right to supervision and improve enterprise leadership, it is necessary to improve the economic knowledge level of party member cadres. Party organizations should study major economic issues in enterprises together with the masses.
    The county and district party congresses also focused on discussing the party's working style in rural areas in order to fully tap agricultural potential. Many representatives requested expanding the party ranks in rural areas and strengthening the party organizations' concern for the affairs of agricultural cooperatives and the work of women and youth. The České Budějovice County Party Congress guaranteed to strive for more farmers to participate in cooperatives, so that the socialist component of the county would reach 96% of the cultivated land area.
    The meetings also demonstrated the necessity of improving the ideological level of party members. At the meetings, the representatives sharply exposed and criticized the unprincipled tendencies of some county committees and branches. At the district party congress in Bratislava, the central topic was ideological work. The meeting emphasized defending the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory, calling for open struggle against revisionism, and organizing extensive discussions against revisionism among the masses.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia attached great importance to the convening of county and district party congresses. Members of the Central Political Bureau Viliam Široký, Karol Bacílek, Rudolf Barák, etc., participated in the meetings separately and spoke at the meetings. The county and district party congresses demonstrated the strengthening of the unity of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the further expansion of its influence. It laid a good foundation for the discussions of the 11th Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

    为完成今年生产任务创造条件
    捷各地召开党员代表会
    在完成社会主义建设口号下，3月份捷克斯洛伐克共产党在全国二百多县和区普遍召开了党员代表大会。会议总结了一年来的工作，讨论了实现国民经济改组和提高农业生产问题。各地代表纷纷表示要用党的政治组织工作来为完成第二个五年计划和今年生产任务创造条件。
    县、区党代会谈到了新形势下党的任务。代表们指出，工业改组以后，为了更好地贯彻党的监督权和改进企业领导，必须提高党员干部的经济知识水平。党组织要和群众一起研究企业中的重大经济问题。
    县、区党代会还着重讨论了党在农村的工作作风问题，以便充分发掘农业潜力。不少代表要求扩大农村党的队伍，加强党组织对农业合作社事务及妇女和青年工作的关心。契斯克布德约维泽县党代会，保证要争取更多的农民参加合作社，使该县社会主义成分达到耕地面积的96％。
    会议也表明提高党员思想水平的必要。代表们在会上尖锐地揭发和批评了某些县委和支部的无原则倾向。在布拉迪斯拉发市的区党代会上，中心议题是思想工作。会议强调捍卫马克思列宁主义学说的纯洁，号召对修正主义进行公开斗争，在群众中组织反修正主义的广泛讨论。
    捷共中央对县、区党代会的召开十分重视。中央政治局委员威·西罗基、卡·巴契列克、鲁·巴拉克等分头参加了会议，并在会上发了言。县、区党代会显示了捷克斯洛伐克共产党团结的加强和影响的进一步扩大。它为捷共第十一次代表大会的讨论奠定了良好基础。
