The people of the capital achieved a brilliant victory on the second day – the 20th – of the concentrated sparrow eradication campaign. According to the results announced by the Beijing Sparrow Eradication Headquarters at 12:00 last night, a total of 248,524 sparrows were poisoned, exhausted, or beaten to death on the 19th and 20th.

Yesterday was Sunday. The various sparrow eradication armies, even larger than on the 19th, stood firm in their positions and fought hard throughout the day, adopting the method of transferring troops and generals to support weak points with fewer people and more sparrows. The Forbidden City Museum has many tall buildings, many ancient trees, many courtyards, and a wide area. On the 19th, only more than 1,000 people were hunting and catching sparrows, leaving many blank spots. Yesterday, more than 1,300 residents and students went to provide support. The Haidian District Sparrow Eradication Headquarters transferred a group of sparrow eradication warriors from Diaoyutai and a certain unit of the garrison to support places with more sparrows, such as Mashenmiao Township and Xiaonanzhuang.

The battle team of more than 580 staff members of the Ministry of Commerce arrived on the battlefield on time. The directors of the twelve bureaus also came, and they were responsible for driving away sparrows on the city walls and moats from Xizhimen to Fuchengmen. More than 50 responsible cadres who came to the Ministry of Commerce from other places to attend meetings also participated in the sparrow eradication battle. Vice Minister of Commerce Li Weixin came to the front early in the morning to supervise the battle.

Factories in the eastern suburbs moved their Tuesday rest day to yesterday. The workers put down their machines, picked up colorful flags, bamboo poles, noisemakers, and scarecrows, and joined the battle. Workers from the Beijing Electron Tube Factory also went to Dongba Township to support farmers in eradicating sparrows. Many cadres, workers, and street residents who were resting at home also drove away sparrows together. Yu Zizhong, a member of the "May Fourth" Agricultural Cooperative in Beiding Township in the eastern suburbs and a skilled sparrow catcher, had captured more than 300 sparrows alive with a net from the morning of the day before yesterday to yesterday morning.

Based on the characteristics of the reduction in the number of sparrows and the increased cunning of the remaining "old home thieves," sparrow catching heroes from various districts held "Zhuge Liang Meetings" to study tactics and fight sparrows with their wisdom. Yesterday, the Dongsi District divided the sparrow catching team into three shifts to fight in rotation, ensuring that people rested but did not give sparrows a chance to breathe. The Hepingli Second Residents Committee in this district concentrated manpower to drive the sparrows to the poisoned bait area, and then kept quiet to lure the sparrows to eat the poisoned bait. Sun Guocheng, a tricycle worker in Qinglongqiao Town, Haidian District, found the position where the sparrows were in a line when he used a fire gun to shoot sparrows, and then fired, causing great damage. He shot seventy-five birds in two days. The front arrow tower, which is ninety-nine feet high, had flocks of sparrows on top that could not be driven away or hit. The soldiers of the communications platoon of the Public Security Corps took out the spirit of attacking enemy fortresses, climbed the roof from the skylight, and put on poisoned bait. Zhang, an eighty-year-old woman who lived along Panjiahe in Xuanwumenwai, found that the sparrows were too hungry and tired to fly high or move when she was knocking on noisemakers to drive them away. She immediately changed her tactics, found a sunflower stalk as a weapon, and searched everywhere. She found a sparrow that could not run in the doorway and beat it to death.

Yesterday, Minister of Health Li Dequan gave a radio speech on Beijing People's Broadcasting Station. She congratulated the people of the capital on their great victory in the sparrow eradication campaign and hoped that all citizens would make persistent efforts to turn the capital into a "four-no" city as soon as possible.

    首都人民两天战斗灭雀二十四万八千
    本报讯　首都人民在突击围剿麻雀的第二天——20日，又取得了辉煌的胜利。据北京市围剿麻雀总指挥部昨晚十二时发表战果称：19、20两日共毒死、累死、打死麻雀二十四万八千五百二十四只。
    昨天是星期日，比19日更为壮大的各路剿雀大军坚守阵地，奋战经日，并采取调兵遣将的办法支援人少雀多的薄弱点。故宫博物院的高大建筑物多、古树多、院落多、地面广，19日只有一千多人打捕，空白点很多，昨天有一千三百多个居民和学生前往支援。海甸区剿雀指挥部从钓鱼台和驻军某部抽调了一批剿雀勇士，支援麻雀较多的马神庙乡和小南庄等地方。
    商业部工作人员五百八十多人组成的战斗队按时开到战场，十二个局的局长们也来了，他们在西直门到阜成门的城墙上、护城河边担任轰赶麻雀的任务。从外地到商业部来开会的五十多名负责干部，也参加剿雀战斗。商业部副部长李维新一早就来到阵地督战。
    东郊各工厂把星期二的休息日挪到昨天，工人们放下机器，拿起彩旗、轰竿、响器、草人，参加了战斗。北京电子管厂的工人还到东坝乡支援农民围剿麻雀。许多在家里休息的干部、工人等和街道居民一起轰赶麻雀。东郊北顶乡“五四”农业社社员、捕雀能手于子中从前天早晨到昨天上午，已经用线网活捉三百多只麻雀。
    根据麻雀减少和残余的“老家贼”更狡猾的特点，各区捕雀英雄纷纷召开了诸葛亮会，研究战术，和麻雀斗智。东四区昨天把捕雀队伍分成三班轮流打，做到人休息不让麻雀有喘息机会。这个区和平里第二居民委员会集中人力把麻雀轰赶到毒饵区，然后保持安静，诱雀吃毒饵。海淀区青龙桥镇三轮工人孙国成用火枪打麻雀时，找到麻雀成一条线的位置，然后开枪，杀伤力很大，两天就打了七十五只。高达九丈九尺的前门箭楼，顶上麻雀成群，轰不走，打不着。公安总队通讯排的战士们拿出攻敌人堡垒的精神，从天窗攀登上屋脊，放上了毒饵。住在宣武门外潘家河沿八十多岁的张老太太在敲响器轰打的时候，发现又饿又累的麻雀飞不高飞不动了，马上改变战术，找了一根向日葵秆当武器，到处搜索，果然在门道里发现了一只跑不动的麻雀，一下子就把它打死了。
    卫生部部长李德全昨天在北京人民广播电台作广播讲话，她祝贺首都人民围剿麻雀的巨大胜利，并希望全体市民再接再厉，争取早日把首都变成四无城。
