Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 24th: Xiangtan County in Hunan Province has recently established an Agricultural Science Research Institute on the basis of promoting experimental fields. The establishment of the institute can combine cadre involvement in experimental fields with scientific research and popularize scientific and technical knowledge among the masses. Therefore, this is another new development in the experience of cultivating experimental fields.

At the end of last year, the Xiangtan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in response to the call of the Party Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, universally established experimental fields. County and township cadres cultivated a total of 2,400 mu of experimental fields. Together with the experimental fields cultivated by primary and secondary school teachers and cadres from various departments, the total was more than 4,000 mu. The County Committee attached great importance to this work, recognizing that it was a necessary path for cadres to be both red and expert. They successively studied and resolved three problems that arose in the cultivation of experimental fields: insufficient integration with the central work, insufficient respect for experienced peasants and technicians, and insufficient integration with scientific and technical experiments. These measures ensured that the experimental fields were always at the forefront, becoming a powerful weapon for guiding the great leap forward in agricultural production.

However, how to combine experimental fields with scientific research, and how to cultivate a daring and capable style among cadres on the basis of cultivating experimental fields through scientific experimental research, remained a problem. In order to solve this problem, the County Committee decided to establish an Agricultural Science Research Institute. After intensive preparations, the institute was finally established at the end of March.

The institute is divided into five parts: The first part is an exhibition hall. It contains a large collection of specimens and samples of wild feed, cash crops, local specialties, various fertilizers, mineral products, and new agricultural tools, indicating their uses and performance. The second part is a livestock farm. It raises various livestock and specializes in studying their living habits. The third part is a meteorological station. It specializes in collecting meteorological data, studying meteorological changes, and imparting meteorological knowledge. The fourth part is a dryland crop (including forestry) experimental field. The fifth part is a paddy field crop experimental field. A laboratory is also planned. The researchers at the institute are responsible cadres such as members of the County Party Committee and general cadres, as well as experienced peasants and technicians from agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry departments. Scientific experimental research is conducted by combining cadres, experienced peasants, technicians, and books.

The equipment of this scientific experimental research institute is very rudimentary, and the buildings are also dilapidated, but it is of great significance for popularizing and improving scientific knowledge and making science better serve production. For example, the county originally only knew that there was peat in Nan Bamboo Mountain but did not know how much there was. Later, the collected peat samples were distributed to each township party secretary, who, after recognizing the peat, found a large amount of peat resources in four townships, making the county a famous peat base in Hunan Province.

Recently, the Xiangtan County Committee organized a group of cadres to intern at the institute, calling on them to formulate plans to be both red and expert.

In order to popularize scientific knowledge throughout the county and combine scientific research with the experimental fields of the vast number of commune members, the County Committee also plans to establish institutions for imparting scientific knowledge within agricultural cooperatives, implementing a combination of agricultural cooperative clubs, farmers' spare-time schools, and agricultural science exhibition halls. This method has recently been tested in the Chihu Agricultural Cooperative with good results and is ready to be vigorously promoted.

    培养敢想敢干风格  发展种试验田经验
    湘潭县建立农业科学实验研究所
    新华社长沙24日电　湖南湘潭县最近在推行试验田的基础上，建立起了农业科学实验研究所。研究所的建立，可以使干部搞试验田同科学研究相结合，并且在群众中普及科学技术知识。因此，这是种试验田经验的又一新的发展。
    去年年底，中共湘潭县委响应党中央和省委的号召，普遍地建立了试验田。全县县、乡干部共种试验田二千四百亩，连同中小学教师和各部门干部种的试验田，总共有四千多亩。县委十分重视这项工作，认识到这是干部又红又专的必经道路。他们先后研究解决了种试验田中出现的与中心工作结合不够，尊重老农与技术员不够，与科学技术结合试验不够等三个问题，使试验田样样走到前面，成为指导农业生产大跃进的有力武器。
    但是，如何使试验田与科学研究相结合，使干部在种试验田的基础上，通过科学实验研究，培养敢想敢为的风格，还是一个问题。为了解决这个问题，县委决定建立农业科学实验研究所。经过紧张的筹备，研究所终于在3月底建成了。
    这个研究所共分五个部分：第一部分是展览馆。里面收集了大量的野生饲料、经济作物和土特产、各种肥料、矿产品和新式农具的标本和样品，标明其用途和性能。第二部分是畜牧场。里面养有各种牲畜，专门研究它们的生活规律。第三部分是气象台。专门收集气象资料，研究气象变化，传授气象知识。第四部分是旱土作物（包括林业）试验田。第五部分是水田作物试验田。还计划建立一个化验室。研究所的研究员是县委委员等负责干部和一般干部，老农和农、林、水利、畜牧等部门的技术员。以干部、老农、技术员、书本相结合的办法进行科学实验研究。
    这个科学实验研究所的设备非常简陋，房子也是破旧的，可是对普及提高科学知识，使科学更好地为生产服务却有极大的意义。例如县里原来只知楠竹山有草炭，不知道究竟有多少。后来把收集到的草炭样品发给每个乡党委书记一份，乡党委书记认识草炭后，又在四个乡找出了大量的草炭资源，使全县一跃而为湖南省著名的草炭基地。
    最近，湘潭县委组织了一批干部在研究所实习，号召他们制定又红又专的规划。
    为了在全县范围普及科学知识，使科学研究与广大社员的试验田结合起来，县委还计划在农业社内建立传授科学知识的机构，实行农业社的俱乐部、农民业余学校、农业科学展览馆三结合。这种办法最近在赤湖农业社试验结果，效果很好，准备大力推广。
