The Ming Tombs are the burial site of thirteen emperors of the Ming Dynasty, the first of whom was Yongle (Ming Chengzu). Five hundred and fifty years ago, not long after Emperor Chengzu ascended the throne, he busied himself with finding a burial place for himself after death. His ministers suggested the Tanzhe Temple in the mining area of western Beijing, but he did not adopt their suggestion. Instead, a feng shui master from Jiangxi named Liao Junqing found Huangtu Mountain in Changping for him, which suited his wishes. Thus, the tombs of the Ming Dynasty emperors were settled here, and Huangtu Mountain was renamed Tianshou Mountain.

This area is a small basin surrounded by mountains on the east, west, and north sides, with only the south side opening to the North China Plain. At this opening, there are two small mountains, one to the east and one to the west, like screens or barriers. Later generations called the eastern one Dragon Mountain and the western one Tiger Mountain. Now, walking into the avenue between Dragon and Tiger Mountains, one can see from afar, at the foot of the mountains surrounded by mountains, ancient buildings with yellow tiles and red walls, which are the location of the Ming Tombs.

This kind of natural terrain surrounded by mountains must have been a good topic for people like Liao Junqing to talk about "feng shui." However, what they did not expect was that after the tombs of the Ming Dynasty emperors were built one after another here, they encountered an insurmountable difficulty, which was the difficulty of water. Here, due to the natural terrain, floods occurred every rainy season, but after the rainy season, there was a lack of water sources. In the feudal ruling era, let alone the common people being unable to do anything about this disaster, even the emperor with great authority was helpless. Let's take two examples to illustrate this.

Before the middle of the Ming Dynasty, three grand "Sacrifice to the Tombs" ceremonies were held every year, the first on Qingming Festival, the second on the Ullambana Festival (also called the Zhongyuan Festival), and the third on the Winter Solstice. The Ullambana Festival (July 15th of the lunar calendar) "Sacrifice to the Tombs" coincided with the rainy season, often encountering mountain floods, with rapid torrents from the surrounding mountains and small streams converging on the basin in the center of the tomb area, causing floods and threatening the "Sacrifice to the Tombs" ceremony. The "Yan Du You Lan Zhi" has such a record: "The Zhongyuan Festival Sacrifice to the Tombs often encounters rain, the rivers rise, and people often suffer from drowning." Therefore, after the fourteenth year of Jiajing (1535), the Ullambana Festival visit to the tombs had to be changed to Frost's Descent, and Frost's Descent was too close to the Winter Solstice, so the Winter Solstice sacrifice was simply abolished. Because of the flood disaster, the three annual "Sacrifice to the Tombs" ceremonies had to be reduced to two. What could the feudal emperor do?

The tomb area had a lot of rain in the summer, causing floods, but when there was little rain in the spring, even drinking water was difficult. The feudal emperor was equally at a loss at this time. For example, in the eighth year of Emperor Shenzong's reign, he suddenly had a great filial piety and took the Empress Dowager, the empress, concubines, and a group of accompanying ministers to the tombs on Qingming Festival. Originally, he wanted to spend the night in the palace in the tomb area, but because there was no water to use, he had to temporarily change his mind and return to Shahe City (then called Gonghua City) on the same day.

The emperors of the Ming Dynasty, even with the power to employ millions of laborers to build their mausoleums, had to bow their heads in the face of the threat of natural disasters. Only the laboring people after liberation dared to stand up and fight against the disasters of nature. The construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir just illustrates this point.

In this area, as mentioned above, there is both too much water and too little water. This is a problem that has been impossible to solve since ancient times, but now is the time to completely change this situation. The construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir is an important measure to change this situation. After the reservoir is built, it can block and store the floods in the rainy season, preventing them from flooding. Furthermore, it will be used to irrigate 200,000 to 300,000 mu of farmland downstream, turning water hazards into water conservancy. When the lake is full, it will be as large as three Kunming Lakes in the Summer Palace. It can be used for fish farming, power generation, and beautifying the entire tomb area. Because on the one hand, it submerges the barren area in the center of the basin caused by erosion, and on the other hand, it changes the climate of the surrounding areas and embellishes the natural scenery. This will also make the mausoleum buildings scattered between the lakes and mountains more majestic and beautiful. And these ancient buildings are no longer valued as the mausoleums of feudal emperors. On the contrary, they are cherished because they represent the labor achievements and artistic creations of the laboring people in history. Here, we see the artistic achievements of the oppressed laboring people in the past, and we also see the power of the laboring people after liberation to comprehensively and consciously conquer nature. If these ancient tombs can still remind us of those feudal emperors in the old days, then facing the emerging Ming Tombs Reservoir, we can only say that the emperors of the feudal era still had to listen to the dictates of nature, while the laboring people of the socialist era have stood up to be the masters of nature!

The construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir is in full swing. The local peasants are showing unparalleled heroism, and the teams supporting from all sides are fully expressing brotherly enthusiasm. Workers, peasants, technicians, cadres of government organs, shop assistants, students of universities and middle schools, plus the invincible People's Liberation Army and the organized white-clad warriors who have gone to the front line of production, tens of thousands of people, under the leadership of the Party, are working with extraordinary enthusiasm to make the Ming Tombs serve socialism.

    十三陵的水
    侯仁之
    十三陵是明朝十三个皇帝埋葬的地方，其中为首的一个是永乐（明成祖）。五百五十年前，明成祖刚做皇帝没几年，就忙着为自己找个死后埋葬的地方。大臣们建议他用现在京西矿区的檀柘寺，他没有采纳，倒是一个江西的风水先生叫作廖均卿的，替他找到了昌平黄土山，这才中了他的意。于是这明朝一代皇帝的坟茔，就在这里定下来，黄土山也就从此改名为天寿山。
    这块地方，是东西北三面有丛山环抱的一个小盆地，独正南一面开向华北大平原，在这开口的地方，有两座小山，一东一西，如屏如障。后人把东边的一座叫龙山，西边的一座叫虎山。现在走进龙虎山中间的大道，就可以远远望见在丛山环抱的山麓台地下，一座座黄瓦红墙的古建筑，那就是十三陵的所在。
    这种山峦环抱的天然地形，一定是廖均卿这类人侈谈“风水”的好题目。但是没有料到当明代帝王的坟墓一个一个在这里建筑起来之后，却遇到了一种无法克服的困难，那就是水的困难。在这里，由于天然地形的关系，每到雨季就要泛滥成灾，但是雨季一过，又感到水源缺乏。这种灾难在封建统治时代，莫说老百姓对它没办法，就是连有天大权威的皇帝也是束手无策的。不妨举两个例子来看。
    明朝中叶以前，每年要举行三次“祀陵”大典，第一次在清明节，第二次在盂兰节（也叫中元节），第三次在冬至。盂兰节（阴历7月15）这一次“祀陵”，正当雨季，常常赶上山洪暴发，周围大山小涧急流奔湍，汇集到陵域中心的盆地上来，泛滥成灾，使“祀陵”大典受到威胁。“燕都游览志”就有这样的记载：“中元节祀陵，往往遇雨，河流汛涨，每苦漂溺”。因此到了嘉靖十四年（1535年）以后，就不得不把盂兰节上陵改到霜降，霜降又离冬至太近，就干脆把冬至一祭撤消了。这一年三次“祀陵”大典，因为洪水为灾，不得不改为两次，封建皇帝有什么办法？
    陵域夏季雨多，泛滥成灾，但是春季雨少的时候，就连饮食用水也都有困难。封建皇帝到这时候，同样一筹莫展。例如：明神宗即位八年，忽然大发孝心，带着皇太后和皇后妃子以及随行大臣一批人马，在清明节去上陵，原本想在陵域的行宫过夜，就是因为没有水用，不得不临时改变主张，当天退回沙河城（当时叫巩华城）。
    明朝的皇帝，纵然有役使千百万劳动人民为他们修建山陵的权势，但是面临着自然灾害的威胁，也不得不低头。只有解放后的劳动人民，才敢于站起来向大自然的灾害展开了斗争，十三陵水库的修建正好说明这样一个问题。
    在这一带地方，像上面所说的是既患水多，又患水少。这是从古以来无法解决的问题，而现在则是彻底改变这种情况的时候了。十三陵水库的修筑，就是改变这种情况的一个重要措施。水库修成以后，可以拦蓄雨季的洪水，不让它泛滥成灾。进一步还要用它来灌溉下游二三十万亩的田地，变水害为水利。湖水蓄满的时候，就会有三个颐和园的昆明湖那么大，既可以养鱼，又可以发电，还可以把整个陵域美化起来。因为它一方面淹没了盆地中心因侵蚀而造成的一片荒凉，另一方面还改变了附近地区的气候，点缀了自然风光，这也会把散布在湖山之间的山陵建筑衬托得更为雄伟、更为美丽。而这些古代建筑也不再是作为封建帝王的陵寝而被重视，相反的它们乃是因为代表了历史上劳动人民的劳动成果和艺术创造而被爱护。在这里，我们看到了过去被压迫的劳动人民的艺术成就，也看到了解放后的劳动人民全面地自觉地征服自然的威力。如果这些古代陵墓在今天还能使我们回想起旧日那些封建皇帝来的话，那么面对着正在出现的十三陵水库，我们也只能说封建时代的皇帝还必须听自然的摆布，而社会主义时代的劳动人民却站起来作了自然的主人！
    十三陵水库的修建工程，正在热火朝天地进行着，当地农民显出了无比的英雄气概，各方支援的队伍充分表示了兄弟般的热情。工人、农民、技术人员、机关干部、商店营业员、大中学校的学生，再加上战无不胜攻无不取的人民解放军和组织起来走上生产前线的白衣战士，几万人的队伍，在党的领导下，在非凡的热情劳动中，要使十三陵为社会主义服务。
