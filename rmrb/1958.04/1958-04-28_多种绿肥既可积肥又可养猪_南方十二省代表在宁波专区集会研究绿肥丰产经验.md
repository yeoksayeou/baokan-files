Multiple Green Manures Can Accumulate Fertilizer and Raise Pigs
Representatives from Twelve Southern Provinces Gather in Ningbo Prefecture to Study Experiences in High-Yielding Green Manure

    (Reported by this newspaper) From April 7th to 15th, the Ministry of Agriculture organized representatives from the agricultural departments of twelve southern provinces to visit and study the experiences of high-yielding and silage-making of purple clover (grass seeds) at two farms and four agricultural cooperatives in Shaoxing, Shengxian, and Yinxian counties of Ningbo Prefecture.
    In recent years, Ningbo Prefecture has achieved great results in increasing green manure production and promoting agricultural and animal husbandry production. Last year, the area sown with green manure accounted for 58.66% of the cultivated land. This year, the estimated yield per mu can reach 4,000 to 5,000 jin of fresh grass, a doubling compared to last year. Key farms and agricultural cooperatives can achieve an average yield of 10,000 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 12,000 jin.
    Due to the increase in green manure production, not only has soil fertility been increased, and the soil improved, enhancing agricultural production; but also the difficulty of insufficient feed has been solved, promoting animal husbandry, especially the rapid development of pig raising. In 1957, Shaoxing County's average grain yield per mu was 658 jin, an increase of 14% compared to 1952. The number of live pigs reached 118,000, an increase of more than five and a half times compared to 1952.
    The meeting studied that the main experience of Ningbo Prefecture is that leaders at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels have a clear guiding ideology of comprehensively developing agricultural production with increased grain production as the center, and regard green manure production as an important link in increasing grain production and developing animal husbandry. It has put forward the principle of "using fields to fertilize pigs, and using pigs to fertilize fields," combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified economy, and correctly applied the mass line method to change the past habits of the masses who believed that green manure is grass and does not need to be strengthened in field management, and that green manure is fertilizer and does not need fertilization, and turned the experience of high-yielding grass seeds and utilization into the specific actions of the broad masses.
    After on-site practical visits, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan and other nine provinces have proposed a plan to sow 194.2 million mu of green manure in 1958, which is more than doubled compared to 1957. (Attached picture)

    多种绿肥既可积肥又可养猪
    南方十二省代表在宁波专区集会研究绿肥丰产经验
    本报讯　4月7日至15日农业部组织南方十二省农业部门的代表在宁波专区的绍兴、嵊县、鄞县的两个农场和四个农业社参观和研究紫云英（草子）丰产、青贮的经验。
    宁波专区几年来增产绿肥促进农牧业生产取得很大成绩。去年播种绿肥面积占耕地面积58.66％。单位产量今年估计每亩可产鲜草四千至五千斤，比去年翻一翻。重点农场和农业社平均亩产可以达到一万斤，最高的可达到一万二千斤。
    由于绿肥增产，不但增加了地力，改良了土壤，提高了农业生产；而且解决了饲料不足的困难，促进了畜牧业，特别是养猪业迅速的发展。绍兴县1957年平均每亩粮食产量六百五十八斤，较1952年提高14％，生猪达到十一万八千头，较1952年增加五倍半以上。
    会议研究了宁波专区的主要经验是省、专、县各级领导有以增产粮食为中心全面发展农业生产的明确指导思想，把绿肥生产当成增产粮食发展畜牧业的重要一环，提出了“以田肥猪，以猪肥田”，农牧结合，发展多种经济的方针，并正确运用了群众路线的方法，改变过去群众认为绿肥是草不需要加强田间管理，绿肥是肥不需施肥的习惯，把草子丰产和利用经验变成了广大群众的具体行动。
    通过现场实际参观后，江苏、安徽、湖南等九省已提出1958年计划播种绿肥面积一万九千四百二十万亩的计划，这比1957年扩大了两倍多。（附图片）
