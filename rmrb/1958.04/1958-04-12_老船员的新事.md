    New Things of an Old Sailor
    Guo Ziqiu, the driver of the Pearl River No. 303 tugboat, is already seventy-five years old. However, he has the same enthusiasm for work as a young man, and has maintained the glorious title of advanced producer for several years.
    Because he is willing to study his profession, he has reformed the wheel and valve, accelerated the speed of the ship, and saved a lot of fuel. In addition, he has also trained many apprentices.
    Some things, which seem difficult for others to do, Guo Ziqiu has done.
    In 1956, when the Soviet delegation of advanced producers of maritime and inland river transport came to Guangzhou to pass on their experience, the head of the delegation, Burlakov, introduced to the crew members of Guangdong, Guangxi and other places the advanced experience of not sending the machine to the factory for repairs for two years (the general rule is to carry out minor repairs every six months). At that time, many crew members believed that not sending the machine to the factory for repairs for two years might work in the Soviet Union because they had an ice age; the rivers in Guangdong did not freeze all year round, and if the machine was not sent to the factory for repairs, there would be no time to repair the machine, so it might not be feasible. At that time, Guo Ziqiu also had such an idea. However, he thought that the Soviet Union was our elder brother, and Burlakov was an advanced producer of maritime and inland river transport in the Soviet Union. He would never travel all the way to pass on "experience" to us that could not be implemented. Therefore, he took the lead in leading the crew to formulate a plan to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced maintenance experience, and personally did the work every time he overhauled, so as to ensure diligent inspection and maintenance. Now, the maintenance method of not sending the machine to the factory for repairs for two years has been formally promoted for one year and six months, and the main engine and auxiliary engine have not been sent to the factory for repairs, and the machine has always been running well.

    老船员的新事
    珠江303号拖轮上的司机郭资囚，已经有七十五岁了。但是他有年青人一样的工作热情，几年来一直保持着先进生产者的光荣称号。
    由于他肯钻研业务，曾经改革了车页和汽门，加快了船行速度，并且节省了很多燃料。此外，他还带了不少徒弟。
    有些事情，在别人看来似乎是很难做到的，但是郭资囚却做到了。
    1956年苏联海上和内河运输先进生产者代表团来广州传授经验的时候，团长布尔拉科夫向广东、广西等地的船员，介绍了机器两年不进厂修理的先进经验（一般规定半年小修一次）。当时许多船员认为，两年不进厂修理，在苏联可以行得通，因为他们有冰河期；广东河流长年不结冰，如果不进厂修理，就没有时间修理机器了，因而不一定可行。当时郭资囚也有这样的想法。但是他想到苏联是我们的老大哥，布尔拉科夫是苏联海上和内河运输的先进生产者，他绝对不会长途跋涉来向我们传授不能实行的“经验”。于是，他首先以身作则带动船员订出了学习苏联先进检修经验的计划，并且每次检修都亲自动手，做到勤检勤修。现在，正式推广两年不进厂修理机器的保养法，已经一年零六个月了，主机和副机一直没有进厂修理，机器运转情况始终良好。
