The Polymer Physical Chemistry Group of the Institute of Chemistry Demonstrates Collective Wisdom in Assembling Instruments

    (Our report) The anti-waste exhibition recently held by the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, proved during the "double-anti" movement that instruments for scientific research can be assembled by relying on collective wisdom. Most of the facts in the exhibition told the audience that this new research institute, which had been under construction for only three years, had serious waste and backlog problems; however, in a small area, it also showed the audience examples of researchers bravely breaking with conventions, bringing collective wisdom into play, overcoming difficulties, and assembling precision instruments themselves to create conditions for research work.

    The head of the Polymer Physical Chemistry Research Group told reporters that when their group was established in 1953, they had no instruments at all. At that time, they planned to first carry out the determination of the molecular weight of polymers, using methods including light scattering, viscosity, osmotic pressure, boiling point elevation, and end-group titration. Among these, except for the relatively simple instruments and equipment required for the viscosity method, the others required instruments with high precision, such as the light scattering method, which required a light intensity measuring instrument with high sensitivity and high stability, and a differential refractometer that could measure the refractive index accurately to the fifth decimal place; such instruments were not available in China at that time, and the conventional method was to order them from abroad. However, if they were ordered from abroad, not to mention the cost of foreign exchange, it would take at least three years to gradually start the work. Therefore, they considered breaking with convention and assembling them themselves. Their way of breaking with convention was to bring collective wisdom into play: that is, to organize the strength according to the expertise of the researchers in the group and cooperate with each other. For example, in assembling light scattering instruments, some of them studied electron tube technology and trial-produced light intensity measuring instruments, while others studied glass adhesives to make specially designed glass solution cells. They used domestic parts and some waste materials, such as old water pipes and waste food cans, and with the assistance of the in-house metalworking shop, successively made many of the precision instruments displayed in the exhibition. These instruments would have cost a considerable amount of foreign exchange if purchased from abroad. For example, differential refractometers and light scattering measuring instruments sell for one to two thousand yuan RMB in some countries, while making their own cost them only three to four hundred yuan at most.

    The precision of these self-made instruments met the requirements, and the experimental data were reliable. They have already conducted valuable research using these instruments.

    The head of the research group also told reporters that they believe that there are benefits to conducting research in this way: First, in the process of assembly, they can gain a lot of valuable knowledge and experience, which has a positive effect on the growth of researchers. At the same time, in terms of ideology, it also makes researchers realize that the completion of an instrument is the result of the hard work of many people; and continuously improving instruments by learning from the experience of predecessors is a condition for scientific development. Second, it is very convenient for work. Because instruments bought from abroad or domestically may not be completely suitable, and they are helpless once they find missing parts or damage; while self-assembled instruments can be designed to meet their own requirements, and because they are familiar with their principles, they can fully master their characteristics, making them easy to repair, easy to improve, and easy to use. Third, the spirit of diligence and thrift can be implemented in the assembly process, on the one hand, saving foreign exchange and domestic funds, and on the other hand, utilizing some waste materials. He also said that doing this does not mean that all instruments no longer need to be ordered from abroad; but under possible conditions, they should bravely use collective wisdom and collective strength to find ways to solve instrument problems themselves.

### 化学研究所高分子物理化学组  发挥集体智慧自己装配仪器

    发挥集体智慧自己装配仪器
    本报讯　中国科学院化学研究所在双反运动中证明：科学研究工作中的仪器，可以发挥集体智慧，自己装配。该所最近举办的反浪费展览会的大部分事实告诉观众，这个筹建刚三年的新研究所有着严重的浪费积压；但是它在很小的面积内告诉观众，这个研究所同时有着研究人员勇敢打破常规，发挥集体智慧，克服困难，自己动手装配精密仪器为研究工作创造条件的事例。
    高分子物理化学研究组负责人告诉记者，他们这个组1953年成立的时候，所需要的仪器丝毫没有。当时，他们筹划首先开展高聚物分子量的测定工作，所用方法包括光散射法、粘度法、渗透压法、沸点升高法、端基滴定法等。这当中，除了粘度法所需要的仪器设备比较简单以外，其他都需要精密度很高的仪器，如光散射测定法，就需要高灵敏度和高稳定度的光强测定仪以及可以测定折光系数准确到第五位的示差折光计；这样的仪器国内当时没有，按常规是向国外订购。可是，如果向国外订购，要花国家的外汇且不说，以时间算，最快也要三年后才能够逐步开展工作。于是他们考虑打破常规，自己装配。他们打破常规的办法是发挥集体智慧：即根据组内各研究人员的专长，把力量组织起来，分工合作。如装置光散射仪器，他们中有的人钻研电子管技术、试装光强度测定器，有的人就研究玻璃的胶粘剂，用以制作自己设计的特种玻璃溶液槽。他们利用了国内可以买到的零件和一些废旧材料，如旧自来水管、废食品罐等，在所内金工场的协助下，先后制成了上述展览会上陈列的许多精密的仪器。这些仪器如果向国外购买要用相当大的一笔外汇。如示差折光计和光散射测定仪，有的国家售价一、二千元人民币，而自己做的最多只花了三、四百元的代价。
    这些自制仪器的精密度都达到了要求，使用结果，实验数据都很可靠，而且他们已经依靠这些仪器进行了有价值的研究。
    研究组负责人还对记者说，他们认为用这样的方式进行研究工作是有好处的：第一，在装置过程中，可以得到很多宝贵的知识和经验，对研究人员的成长起了积极作用。同时在思想上这也使研究人员认识到，一个仪器的完成，是多少人付出辛苦的劳动换取的；而且吸取前人经验不断地改进仪器，正是科学发展的条件。第二，对工作有很大的便利。因为从国外或国内买来的仪器不一定完全合用，一旦发现缺少零件或者有所损坏更是束手无策；而自己装置的仪器，可以设计得合乎自己的要求，并且因为熟悉它的原理，能够充分掌握它的特性，便于修理，便于改进，使用起来可以得心应手。第三，在装置过程中可以贯彻勤俭节约的精神，一方面是节约外汇和国内资金，另一方面是利用了一些废旧材料。他还说，他们这样做，并不等于所有的仪器目前都不再需要向国外订购；但是在可能条件下，应该勇敢地用集体智慧、集体力量，自己想办法来解决仪器问题。
