Everything for the Customer
——A Glimpse of the Capital's Market
By Our Reporter

	The 19th was a weekend. We visited Beijing's vegetable markets, non-staple food stores, department stores, restaurants, barbershops, bathhouses, and the hostel near the train station as ordinary customers. Everywhere we could see service personnel warmly and politely receiving customers, making people feel happy and warm.

		“Do you want sliced meat or shredded meat?”

	At seven o'clock in the morning, we entered a non-staple food store at Dengshi West Exit along with some customers. The salespersons here stood in front of the stalls, greeting customers cordially and introducing the goods. The vegetable section was the busiest. Three or four salespersons, with smiling faces and tireless hands and feet, received batches of customers. At this moment, the salesperson Wang Shicheng ran over, carrying seven or eight vegetable baskets filled with fresh green spinach, chives, and scallions. We didn’t know what was going on. It turned out that more than a dozen blind artists lived near the store. Every morning, the salesperson would go to each house, ask what vegetables they needed, and take their vegetable baskets, fill them with vegetables, and deliver them.

	The sound of cutting meat at the meat counter never stopped. The salesperson would ask every customer who handed over a meat purchase certificate: “How do you want to eat it, sliced or shredded?” An old lady, who looked like a regular customer, said with a beaming smile, “Both shredded and sliced. I also want ground meat for dumplings.” “Okay, I’ll cut it for you and grind the dumpling filling. Please sit down and wait.” The old lady sat in the chair in the center of the sales floor, watching the salesperson cut meat for her, showing an indescribable satisfaction.

	Although there were many people in the morning, one didn't feel any sense of waiting or neglect in this store. The salesperson greeted everyone warmly and said goodbye kindly when they left. Sometimes, some old customers could be seen holding ground meat, calling the salespersons "Old Li" and "Old Song," asking them to go home to eat dumplings.

	Delivering soy sauce to Grandma Huang

	Beijing has mobile sales carts. Deng Yanhua, a salesperson from the Second Non-staple Food Retail Store in Bica Hutong, Xidan, set off with his cart at eight o'clock in the morning. When he entered the south entrance of Nanguan Street, he shouted, "Mobile cart is here!" Soon, six or seven housewives gathered around the cart, some with small bowls to buy two cents worth of soy sauce, some with bottles to buy five cents worth of vinegar. Deng Yanhua did not find even these small transactions of a few cents troublesome and treated them warmly even if they only bought one cent worth of goods.

	Deng Yanhua continued to push the cart forward and stopped at door number nine. He put down the cart and went straight to number nine, as if walking to his own home. After a while, he came out with a large bottle, poured in a few measures of soy sauce, and sent it to the courtyard. When he came back, we asked him what was going on. He said that there was an old woman, Grandma Huang, in her sixties, living in this courtyard, who had difficulty moving around. Every day when he passed by here, he had to ask her what she needed. When the cart arrived at the north entrance of Nanguan Street, Deng Yanhua took out a bottle full of oil from the cabinet and delivered it to door number eight of Nanbanbi Street. This was six liang (approximately 300 grams) of oil that Old Xu, who was over sixty years old, had given him the money, oil coupons, and bottle for yesterday, asking him to bring it.

	In Nanqianzhang Hutong, an old woman named Li, who suffered from eye disease, asked us after buying things, "Are you here to learn from Old Deng?" She said: "Comrade Deng is very good. He is never bothered by us when we buy things, no matter how much. Sometimes, even if he has passed our door very far, we just shout and he will push the cart back. Our area is far from the cooperative. We really can't do without him. I have long wanted to write a letter of praise to him, but my eyes are bad and it is inconvenient to write. Please convey it to their superiors for us."

	There are now more than 240 such mobile carts in the city, carrying more than 130 kinds of goods such as oil and salt. The masses call them "living stores."

		“He is so considerate!”

	At twelve noon, in the You Yi Shun Halal Restaurant in Xidan, a middle-aged customer walked in. "How many? Please sit here!" The waiter Li Xiangshou greeted the customer and introduced the names and prices of the dishes, letting the customer choose. For a long time, the customer hesitated, asking the waiter: "Is there anything cheap?" Li Xiangshou guessed the customer's feelings – wanting to eat well economically. Li Xiangshou said, "How about this? I guarantee you'll eat well and it'll be cheap. Half a jin of pancakes, a mixed vegetable dish, and a bowl of Muxu soup will cost no more than five jiao." The customer agreed and went to the street. Not long after he left, the food was ready. Li Xiangshou, not seeing the customer return, was afraid the food would get cold, so he covered it with a bowl. A few minutes later, the customer came back. Li Xiangshou asked: "Is the food cold? Are the pancakes not hot? Should I change them?" When the customer was about to finish eating, Li Xiangshou ran to the table again to ask if he had enough to eat. Seeing that the customer was about to finish, he handed the customer mouthwash and a wet towel. When we asked the customer what he thought of the restaurant, he said: "It's great! This waiter is so considerate and thoughtful. I originally thought it would cost a lot of money to eat well here!"

		Planned it on the train

	The night in Beijing has come, and the whole city is illuminated with lights. At this time, we came to the Dazhong Hostel, which is called "Travelers' Home" by many travelers. Passengers who had just gotten off the train came here one after another. The service staff was busy taking luggage, introducing rooms, serving tea, and pouring water. Some service personnel asked passengers if they needed help buying opera tickets, movie tickets, boat tickets, or train tickets….

	More and more passengers arrived, and soon it was full. At nine o'clock, another passenger came from Liangxiang. The service staff apologized and said that the rooms were full, suggesting he go to another hostel. The passenger said: "I stayed here on my last business trip and found it more convenient and comfortable than at home. This time, I planned on the train that I must stay here. Please find a way." The passenger's earnest request moved the service staff. They vacated a bed in the staff dormitory and prepared to move him to the vacant room the next day. The passenger said with satisfaction: "Great, thank you."

	The passenger Yan Linge, who was staying in room number four, was confidently asking the service staff to take care of a private matter. This passenger was going to the Northeast on a business trip. He wanted to bring his father to live with him in Changsha, Hunan, where he worked. His original plan was to wait for his father to come to Beijing from Shanxi before going to the Northeast. After staying in the hostel for a few days and seeing that the service staff was even more attentive than his family, he changed his plan and wanted to go to the Northeast in advance. He carefully told the service staff his father's appearance, age, and name, and asked the service staff to be responsible for receiving him, arranging accommodation, and waiting for him to return from the Northeast.

	In the manager's office, the hostel manager told us that from the beginning of April to today, the hostel had received more than 100 letters of commendation from passengers.

	“The rainy season is coming soon, take a look at the rubber shoes!”

		“The rainy season is coming soon, take a look at the rubber shoes!” A female salesperson in the shoe and hat department of the department store warmly greeted the customers who came to her. A customer walked to the counter of high-top rubber shoes, and she quickly came over: "Comrade, are you looking at high-top rubber shoes?" "Are there any higher than this?" "Yes, let me get them for you to see." Four or five pairs of shiny black rubber shoes of different heights and sizes were placed in front of the customer. "Take a few pairs to the chair and try them on, take whichever pair fits." The customer took the shoes and sat down in the chair, and she followed, helping the customer try them on. She touched the front of the foot and then the back of the foot: "How is it, is it too big? I think it's a bit big, let's change another pair!" The salesperson's enthusiasm made the customer feel overwhelmed, and she kept saying "Thank you! Thank you!"

	In the women's shoe department, a young girl was buying leather sandals, unsure whether to choose black or red. "What color do you like?" the salesperson asked her. She said she liked black, but when she tried them on, she didn't think they looked good. It turned out that she was wearing dark red socks, which didn't look bright when paired with black shoes. The salesperson told her that black shoes looked good with light-colored socks. White or light yellow socks, paired with black sandals, looked good and generous. Finally, the girl made up her mind.

    一切为了顾客
    ——首都市场一日见闻
    本报记者
    19日这天是周末，我们以一个普通顾客的身份观光了北京的菜市场、副食品商店、百货商店、饭馆、理发馆、浴池和火车站附近的旅社。到处都可看到服务人员们在热情地有礼貌地接待顾客。使人感到处处愉快、温暖。
        “您吃肉片还是吃肉丝？”
    早晨七点钟，我们和一些顾客一起走进了灯市西口的一个副食品商店。这里的售货员们站在货摊前和顾客亲热地打招呼、介绍商品。青菜组最忙，三、四个售货员笑容满面，手脚不停地接待着一批一批的顾客。这时，售货员王世诚跑来，提着七、八个菜篮子走了，篮子里装着鲜绿的菠菜、韭菜和小葱。我们不知道是怎么回事。原来，商店附近住着十几个盲艺人，每天早晨售货员到各家去一趟，问他们要什么菜，顺便把每家的菜篮子拿来，装好菜送去。
    在肉柜前切肉的声音响个不停，对每个递过购肉证来的顾客，售货员都问一声：“您怎么吃，是吃肉片还是吃肉丝？”一位老太太看样子是位老顾客，她喜笑颜开地说：“也吃丝也吃片，还要吃饺子的肉馅。”“好吧，我给你切好，把饺子馅绞好，你在椅子上坐下等会”。老太太坐在售货场中央的椅子上，看着售货员给她切肉，流露着说不出的满意。
    早晨虽然人多，在这个商店里丝毫不使人感到有等待与冷落之感。售货员对每个人都热情招呼，走时亲切道别。有时还可看到一些老顾客拿着绞好的肉馅子，老李、老宋的叫着售货员的名字，让他们家里去吃饺子。
      给黄老大娘送酱油来了
    北京有流动售货车，西单辟才胡同第二副食品零售店售货员邓延华，早上八点钟就推着车子出发了。进了南宽街南口，他就喊“流动车来了！”不一会，六、七个家庭主妇就向车子围拢来，有的拿着小碗买二分钱的酱，有的拿着瓶子买五分钱的醋。对这三分两分的小宗交易，邓延华一点也不嫌麻烦，就是买一分钱的东西他也热情相待。
    邓延华推着车子继续往前走，到了门牌九号就停了下来，放下车子直冲九号走去，好像往自己家走一样。不一会他拿着一个大瓶子出来，倒上了几提酱油就又送到院里去了。他回来后我们问他怎么回事，他说，这院里有一位六十多的黄老大娘，走动不方便，每天路过这里我得去问一趟要什么东西。车子到南宽街北口时，邓延华又从柜子里取出了一个装满油的瓶子，送到南半壁街门牌八号去了，这是昨天他来这里时，六十多岁的许老头交给他钱、油票和瓶子，让他给捎来的六两油。
    在南千章胡同一位害眼病的李大娘，买完东西后问我们：“你们是来向老邓学习的吧？”她说：“邓同志可好了，我们买东西时多会也不怕麻烦，有时他走过了我们的门很远，我们一喊就把车推回来。我们这一带离合作社远，离了他可真不行。我早就说给他写个表扬信，可是我的眼有病，写字不方便，请你们替我们转达给他们的上级领导吧。”
    现在全市这种流动货车有二百四十多辆，带着油、盐等一百三十多种商品。群众都称它为“活商店”。
            “真会体贴人！”
    中午十二时，在西单又一顺清真饭馆里，一位壮年顾客走了进来。“几位？这边坐！”服务员李祥寿迎上去和这位顾客打招呼，接着他就介绍饭菜名称和价钱，让顾客选择。很长时间这位顾客犹豫不定，问服务员：“有便宜的没有？”李祥寿猜到了这位顾客的心情——又要经济又要吃饱。李祥寿说：“这么办吧，保险让你吃好，又便宜，来半斤饼，一个杂会菜，来一碗木须汤，一共超不过五角钱。”顾客答应后到街上去了，走后不久饭菜就好了，李祥寿不见顾客回来，怕菜凉了，用碗扣了起来。没过几分钟顾客回来了，李祥寿问：“菜凉不凉，饼不热了，换一换吧？”顾客快要吃完时，李祥寿又跑到桌前问够不够吃？看着顾客快吃完了，他就把漱口水、湿毛巾递给了顾客。我们问顾客对这饭馆有什么意见时，他说：太好了，这个服务员真会体贴人，想的也周到，我原来以为在这吃饭要花很多钱才能吃好哩！”
            在火车上就计划好了
    北京的夜晚已经来临，全城万家灯火，这时我们又来到了被许多旅客称为“旅客之家”的大众旅社。刚下火车的旅客陆续来到这里，服务员正忙碌地接行李，介绍房间，送茶递水，有的服务员问旅客是否需要代买戏票、电影票、船票或车票……。
    旅客越来越多，不一会就住满了，到了九点钟又从良乡来了一位旅客，服务员很抱歉地说客房已经满了，介绍他到别的旅社去住，这位旅客说：“上次出差住在这里，感到比家里还方便、舒服。这次，我在火车上，就计划好了，一定要住在这里。你们给想想办法吧。”这位旅客的恳切要求感动了服务员。他们就在职工宿舍里腾出了一张床位，准备第二天再让他搬到空出的客房去。这位旅客很满意地说：“太好了，谢谢。”
    住在四号房间的旅客阎林阁正在很放心地请服务员办一件私事。这位旅客是到东北去出差的。他想把他的父亲接到他工作的地方——湖南长沙去同住。他原先的计划是在旅社里等他的父亲从山西来北京后，再动身去东北。当他在旅社内住了几天，看到服务员的态度比家人还亲以后，就改变了计划，想提前动身去东北。他仔细地把他父亲的容貌、年龄、姓名告诉服务员，请服务员负责招待，安排住房，等他从东北回来。
    在经理办公室，旅社经理告诉我们，从4月初到今天，旅社已经收到一百多封旅客的表扬信。
  “雨季快来了，看看胶鞋吧！”
      “雨季快来了，看看胶鞋吧！”百货大楼鞋帽部的一位女售货员热情地迎接着走到她面前的顾客。一位顾客走到了高筒胶鞋的柜台前，她很快就走了过来：“同志，看高筒胶鞋吗？”“还有比这高的吗？”“有，我拿来你看看。”四、五双乌黑发亮高矮不同号码不同的胶鞋摆在了这位顾客面前。“先拿几双到椅子上坐下试试，哪双合适要哪双。”顾客拿了鞋坐到椅子上，她也跟了过来，帮这位顾客试穿，她摸摸脚前，又摸摸脚后：“怎么样，大吗？我看有点大，再换一双吧！”售货员的热情使这位顾客不知如何是好，一再说“谢谢！谢谢！”
    在女鞋部一个年轻的姑娘正买皮凉鞋，要黑的，还是红的，她拿不定主意。“你喜欢什么颜色呢？”售货员问她，她说她喜欢黑的，可穿上一试就觉得不好看。原来她穿的是深红色的袜子，和黑鞋配起来显得不鲜亮。售货员告诉她，黑鞋配颜色素淡的袜子就好看了。白的、淡黄色的袜套，配上黑凉鞋又好看又大方，最后这位姑娘才拿定了主意。（附图片）
