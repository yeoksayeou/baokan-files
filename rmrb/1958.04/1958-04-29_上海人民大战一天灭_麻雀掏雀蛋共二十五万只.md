Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th. The people of Shanghai launched an all-out war against sparrows on the 27th. On this day, a total of sparrows were eliminated and 251,624 sparrow eggs were obtained and 110,621 nests were destroyed.

    On the eve of the battle, a net was already laid throughout the city. Scarecrows and dummies were placed on every building, with an average of one sparrow-chasing哨岗 sentry post set up every ten square meters. At 5:00 in the morning, Jin Zhonghua, the chief commander of sparrow eradication and the Vice Mayor of Shanghai, issued a general attack order to the people of the city. Immediately, countless sentry posts set up on the roofs of buildings, trees, roadsides, and fields began to sound gongs and drums, and red flags fluttered, launching a bombing, driving, capturing, and hitting offensive against the sparrows. Due to Shanghai's dense population, safety was ensured, and no shooting was used. Poisoned bait was only used in a very few areas. In the morning, when the sparrows had not yet found food, they were bombed and driven away; in the evening, when the sparrows returned to their nests and could not find their homes, they were exhausted, and many fell on their own or were captured.

    Obtaining sparrow eggs was a large part of the victory. Lu Foxiang, an advanced producer in Shanghai and from the Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 2, and his four sons followed the traces of sparrow droppings and found more than 600 sparrow nests, thus obtaining 750 sparrow eggs and three sparrows. Residents in Xuhui District, while bombing and driving, opened their pigeon cages, and many sparrows avoided entering the pigeon cages, capturing many alive.

    Jin Zhonghua, the chief commander of sparrow eradication in the city, congratulated the people of the city on their brilliant victory at 7:00 in the evening. He said that this battle was a victory, but there were definitely more sparrows than just these in Shanghai, and repeated assaults must be made. He asked the citizens to sum up their experiences and prepare for another full-scale war after the wheat harvest.

    上海人民大战一天灭
    麻雀掏雀蛋共二十五万只
    新华社上海28日电　上海市人民27日展开了一场全面围剿麻雀大战。这一天共歼灭麻雀和掏获麻雀蛋二十五万一千六百二十四只，捣毁雀窝十一万零六百二十一个。
    大战前夜，全市便已布置了一个天罗地网。在每个建筑物上都安有草人、假人，平均每十平方公尺就设有一个驱赶麻雀的岗哨。早晨五时，全市灭雀总指挥、上海市副市长金仲华向全市人民发布总攻击命令以后，设在大楼屋顶上、树上、路旁、田野间无数的岗哨立刻金鼓齐鸣，红旌飞舞，对麻雀展开了轰、赶、捕、打。由于上海人口密集，保证安全，没有采用枪打，施用毒饵也只有极个别地区。早晨，麻雀还没有找到食物的时候，便受到轰赶；黄昏时分，麻雀归窝找不到家，疲倦不堪，有很多自行坠落或被捕。
    掏获麻雀蛋是这次战果中的一大部分。上海市先进生产者、上海钢铁二厂鲁佛祥父子四人，跟着雀粪的痕迹找到六百多个雀窝，因此掏到了七百五十只雀蛋和三只麻雀。徐汇区的居民一边轰赶，一边把鸽笼开放，许多麻雀避进鸽笼，活捉到许多。
    全市灭雀总指挥金仲华晚上七时向全市人民祝贺获得的辉煌战果。他说，这场大战是胜利的，但是上海的麻雀绝不止这一些，必须反复突击。他要求市民们总结经验，准备到麦熟收割以后再举行一次全面围剿大战。
