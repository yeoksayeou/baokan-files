Also Talking About Sweet Potatoes
Qin Baolin

When treating patients, after prescribing a good prescription, the patient's family members often ask, "Doctor, what can we get the patient to eat?" I always answer like this: "Make him a bowl of finger millet flour porridge, or else, make some sweet potato soup."

According to traditional Chinese medicine's conditioning of patients, for progressive real heat syndromes or extremely weak deficiency syndromes, it is better to eat light food than overly rich food during treatment. When looking for "sweet, neutral, mild, and harmonious" items, sweet potatoes are the first choice. Moreover, sweet potatoes also have medicinal effects. Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica states that "sweet potatoes mainly treat: replenishing deficiency and fatigue, benefiting qi and strength, strengthening the spleen and stomach, and strengthening kidney yin, with effects similar to yams." Zhao Xuemin even said that sweet potatoes can treat dysentery with bloody stools, damp-heat jaundice, seminal emission and turbid urine, blood deficiency and menstrual irregularities, and children's malnutrition. Ancient people also recorded that regular consumption of sweet potatoes can prolong life. Ji Han of the Jin Dynasty wrote in "Southern Grass and Wood Records": "In the old Zhuyai area, the people in the sea do not engage in farming, but only dig the ground to plant sweet potatoes. The people in the sea who live over a hundred years old do so because they do not eat grains but eat sweet potatoes."

Sweet potatoes grow sprawling on the ground, with one stem spreading hundreds of stems, rooting at each node, so they can produce dozens of dan per mu, which is twenty times higher than the yield of grains per mu. In recent years, experiments in Guangxi and other places on grafting sweet potatoes with sunflowers have resulted in individuals weighing up to one hundred catties, which can be said to be unprecedented. Recently, Shanxi has recommended potatoes as a "staple food," which is even more in line with public opinion.

Carefully examining various notes, the origin of sweet potatoes seems to be a bit confusing. Ji Han believes that sweet potatoes originated on the coast of the South China Sea; Lu Yao said that Chen Jinglun of Fujian introduced them from Luzon; Qunfang Pu recorded "Zhu potato is also called sweet potato"; Qing Biji Leichao recorded "originally from the Ryukyu Kingdom." In fact, sweet potatoes have white-fleshed and yellow-fleshed varieties. The Jin Dynasty notes refer to white-fleshed sweet potatoes (as does Chen Qi's "Record of Strange Things"). According to my understanding among farmers, what is now called "sweet potato" in the South originally only referred to yellow-fleshed sweet potatoes. White-fleshed sweet potatoes were not originally prefixed with the character "蕃" (fán, foreign), and only the later introduced yellow-fleshed sweet potatoes were called "蕃薯" (fān shǔ, foreign potato). Because the two are not very different in shape, the "Qunfang Pu" and other records do not distinguish between yellow and white when recording, and collectively call them "蕃薯." Later, due to long-term reproduction, crossing, and variation, even the skin and flesh of sweet potatoes have yellow and white, light red and dark red, and dark yellow and light yellow distinctions.

    也谈甘薯
    覃保霖
    给病人治疗时，处好方后，病人家属常常要问一句：“医生，能给病人弄点甚么吃的呢？”我总是这样回答：“给他调碗穇子粉吧，要不然，给弄点甘薯汤吧。”
    根据中医对病人的调理，处于进行性实热症或极度衰惫的虚症，正在治疗的当儿，进清淡一点的食物比过度肥厚的食物要好得多。要找“甘平清和”之品，甘薯就首当其选了。而且甘薯还有药效，李时珍本草纲目称“甘薯主治：补虚乏，益气力，健脾胃，强肾阴，功同薯蓣”。赵学敏更谓甘薯能治痢疾下血，湿热黄疸，遗精淋浊，血虚经乱，小儿疳积。昔人还有关于经常食用甘薯能够延年益寿的记载。晋朝嵇含撰著的“南方草木状”说：“旧珠崖之地，海中之人，皆不业耕稼，惟掘地种甘薯，海中之人寿百余岁者，由不食五谷而食甘薯故尔。”
    甘薯是扑地缠生的，一茎蔓延数十百茎，节节生根，所以能够一亩高产达数十担，比种五谷的亩产高达二十倍。近年广西等地试验甘薯与日光花嫁接的结果，个体竟有重达一百斤的，可说是史无前例。最近山西又把薯类推荐到“主食”的地位，更是群情允洽的了。
    细绎诸家笔记，对甘薯的来源好像还有点纠缠不清。嵇含认定甘薯原产南海之滨；陆燿谓闽人陈经纶引渡自吕宋；群芳谱记“朱薯亦名蕃薯”；清稗类钞记“本出琉球国”。其实甘薯的品种有白心与黄心之别，晋人笔记是指的白心甘薯（陈祈畅异物志并同）。据我在农民中了解，现在南方所称“蕃薯”，原来仅指黄心甘薯。白心甘薯当初是不加“蕃”字的，后世引入的黄心甘薯才叫“蕃薯”。由于两者在形态上相差不远，所以“群芳谱”等记载的时候不分黄白，混称“蕃薯”了。其后由于长期繁殖交接和变异，连甘薯的皮和肉都有黄有白，有浅红深红，有浓黄淡黄等等区别了。
