    From Unclear to Clear, From Unconscious to Conscious
    Our Experience in Implementing the Central Government’s Policy of Production for Self-Reliance in Urban Social Welfare Work
    Tao Youliang, First Secretary of the Xuzhou Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China
    The social welfare production undertaking in Xuzhou has developed under the guidance of the central government's policy of production for self-reliance. However, the understanding of this policy progressed from unclear to clear, and the execution of this policy evolved from unconscious to conscious, which was a lengthy and tortuous process.
    Before liberation, Xuzhou was a typical consumer city, not only home to a large number of urban poor, but also fostering many prostitutes, vagrants, and beggars... Therefore, while vigorously restoring the economy after liberation, we had to make appropriate arrangements for the lives of these people. Although the central government clearly put forward that the urban social welfare work policy must focus on organizing production for self-reliance, we did initially organize some production for self-reliance units, but the vast majority were established by the government investing in and absorbing some families of revolutionary martyrs and urban poor. The remaining majority still relied on government relief to maintain their lives. During the high tide of cooperativization in 1956, due to insufficient understanding of the particularity of social welfare production, we indiscriminately transferred more than thirty production for self-reliance units to industrial and handicraft departments. As a result, cadres had even more differences in understanding the fundamental issue of the direction of social welfare work: production or relief? Relying on government investment and support or relying on the masses for self-reliance? Organizing temporary production or having long-term plans? The vagueness in ideological understanding hindered the development of social welfare production. At the end of 1956, the situation underwent a new change. The central government put forward the policy of "guaranteeing key projects and appropriately contracting," requiring everything to start from the 600 million people, taking into account all aspects, and making comprehensive arrangements. According to the central government's instructions, we researched and analyzed the role of social welfare work in the new situation. We believed that how to gradually lift a considerable number of urban poor out of poverty as the people's living standards continued to improve was a problem that urban social welfare work must solve. Investigation materials proved that those upright working people, although they had lost some of their labor power, were unwilling to eat handouts and were willing to contribute their share to the cause of socialist construction. Those who were unwilling to work and only wanted to sit and eat handouts were precisely the people who needed to be reformed through labor. Therefore, we firmly chose the path of relying on the masses to vigorously develop social welfare production to gradually get rid of the poverty of citizens, and took this as the central task of the civil affairs department and the street residents' committees.
    Turning this policy into the action of the masses requires a lot of hard work. At that time, the outstanding ideological problem was not believing in the power of the masses. In addition to strengthening political and ideological education, we first selected several key residents' committees and conducted typical experiments by cadres from the civil affairs department and various districts. The main purpose was to explore the experience of relying on the masses' own strength for production and self-reliance, to create a model for everyone to follow. At the same time, the leadership should provide support to social welfare production in all aspects, such as linking up with state-owned enterprises and using waste materials from large factories as raw materials; when balancing supply, production, and sales every quarter, incorporating some major social welfare production units into the plan for unified arrangement; and when conflicts arise with industry and handicrafts, allowing them to produce whatever is suitable for social welfare production. In order to enable social welfare production to form a complete system, based on the principle of focusing on small-scale operations and combining large, medium, and small-scale operations, the quarries of the construction department and the hemp fiber factory of the commercial department were assigned to them as the backbone, so as to support the weak with the strong and bring the small with the large. In this way, social welfare production work has developed rapidly. To date, there are 301 units, and all relief households have participated in production. It is estimated that the total annual output value can reach 28 million to 30 million yuan. The result of the development of social welfare production is, first, to turn consumers into producers and relief households into self-sufficient households; second, to transform society, transform people, change social customs, and strengthen the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses; and third, to make up for the deficiencies in local industrial and handicraft production and become an important force in transforming consumer cities into production cities.
    The development of social welfare production in Xuzhou proves that the central government's policy of "production for self-reliance" is completely correct, and at the same time proves that the specific methods we have explored to implement the central government's policy are also correct.

### 从不明确到明确　从不自觉到自觉  我们执行中央关于城镇社会福利工作以生产自救为主方针的体会

    从不明确到明确　从不自觉到自觉
    我们执行中央关于城镇社会福利工作以生产自救为主方针的体会
    中共徐州市委第一书记　陶有亮
    徐州市的社会福利生产事业是在中央以生产自救为主的方针指导下发展起来的。但对这个方针的认识从不明确到明确，对这个方针的执行从不自觉到自觉，却是经过一个漫长和曲折的过程的。
    解放前徐州是一个典型的消费城市，不仅居住着大批的城市贫民，而且还寄养着许多娼妓、游民、乞丐……。因而解放后我们在大力恢复经济的同时，必须对这些人的生活作适当安排。虽然中央明确提出城镇的社会福利工作方针必须以组织生产自救为主，我们当时也曾着手组织了一些生产自救单位，但绝大多数是由政府投资吸收一部分烈军属和城市贫民办起来的，其余大多数人仍然是依靠政府救济来维持生活。1956年合作化高潮时，由于我们对社会福利生产的特殊性认识不足，不加分别的将三十余个生产自救单位移交给工业及手工业部门。这样，干部对社会福利工作的方向这个根本问题更产生了认识上的分歧：是生产还是救济？是依靠政府投资扶持还是依靠群众自力更生？是组织临时生产还是要有长期打算？思想认识上的模糊，阻碍了社会福利生产事业的发展。1956年末形势发生了一个新的变化。中央提出了“保证重点、适当收缩”的方针，一切要从六亿人口出发，统筹兼顾，全面安排。根据中央指示，我们对社会福利工作在新形势下的作用作了研究分析，我们认为如何随着人民生活水平不断提高使为数不少的城市贫民也逐步摆脱贫困的生活，这是城镇社会福利工作必须解决的问题。调查材料证明那些正直的劳动人民，虽然丧失了部分劳动力，也不甘愿吃救济，愿意在社会主义建设的事业中有一分热发一分光。而那些不愿劳动只想坐吃救济的人，又正是需要在劳动中予以改造的人。因此我们坚定的选择了依靠群众大力发展社会福利生产来逐步摆脱市民贫困的道路，并以此作为民政部门和街道居民委员会的中心任务。
    将这个方针变成群众的行动是要做许多艰苦工作的。当时突出的思想问题是不相信群众的力量。我们对此除加强政治思想教育外，首先选择几个重点居民委员会，由民政部门和各区的干部进行典型试验。主要是摸索依靠群众自己的力量生产自救的经验，作出样子，让大家照着办。同时，领导上要从各方面给社会福利生产以支持，如与国营企业挂上钩，利用大厂的废料作为原料；在每季平衡供产销时，将社会福利生产的某些主要单位纳入计划，统一安排；在与工业、手工业发生冲突时，只要是适合社会福利生产的，就让给他们生产。为了使社会福利生产能够形成一个完整的系统，根据以小型为主大中小型结合的原则，曾经将建筑部门的采石场、商业部门的麻刀厂划归他们，作为骨干，以便以强扶弱，以大带小。这样，社会福利生产工作便迅速发展起来，至目前止，已有三百零一个单位，救济户全部参加了生产，预计全年产值可以达到二千八百万——三千万元。社会福利生产发展的结果，第一，是把消费者变成生产者，救济户变成自给户；第二，改造了社会，改造了人，改变了社会风气，密切了党和政府同群众的关系；第三，弥补了地方上工业和手工业生产的不足，成为变消费城市为生产城市的一支重要力量。
    徐州市社会福利生产的发展，证明中央“生产自救”的方针完全正确，同时证明我们摸索出来的执行中央这一方针的具体办法也是正确的。
