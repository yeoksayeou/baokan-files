　　The second act of Lao She's play "Teahouse" begins with a debate about the issue of cutting off queues. Wang Shufang, the proprietress of Yutai Teahouse, advises Li Sanye, the waiter, to cut off his queue, believing that the queue is "such an eyesore" and incompatible with the "great reform" trend of the time; however, Li Sanye insists on keeping his queue. He first fears, "What if the emperor comes back?" Later, he simply retorts, "You find it an eyesore, but I find it unsettling!"

　　Hearing this implicit dispute over what is pleasing to the eye and what is pleasing to the heart, and thinking about our own task of passing the socialist test today, I realized a truth: why were people so stubbornly unwilling to cut off their queues forty-seven years ago?

　　Forty-seven years ago, cutting off queues was a politically charged movement. Originally, Han people did not shave their heads, but tied all their hair on top of their heads into a bun. After the Manchus entered the customs, they ordered shaving, saying: "Keep the head, not the hair; keep the hair, not the head." In order to oppose shaving and keep queues, the Han people at the time carried out fierce struggles, and many people died for this reason. Now the barbers who walk the hutongs carry a carrying pole on their shoulders. It is said that after the Manchus entered the customs, this upright pole was used to hang "imperial edicts," on which were likely written slogans such as "By imperial decree, shave and keep queues" or "Keep the head, not the hair; keep the hair, not the head." It is also said that this upright pole was used to hang human heads to warn those who resisted shaving and keeping queues. By the time of the Xinhai Revolution, cutting off queues had become a politically charged movement marking national revolution, which was related to the "Han" character banners displayed in parades and the use of "Yellow Emperor Era" years in announcements. Cutting off queues illustrated two things: anti-Manchu, wanting a "republic" and "civilization." Therefore, on the issue of cutting off queues, a division was created between the old and new factions: whoever cut off their queue proved that they were progressive, "reformed," civilized, and in favor of the republic; while whoever refused to cut off their queue proved that they were backward, stubborn, and nostalgic for the Manchu Qing. It can be seen that, politically speaking, this queue had to be cut off.

　　From a living perspective, this queue also had to be cut off. People with queues found it inconvenient to move and work. When fighting with others, one had to first coil up the queue to prevent the opponent from grabbing it. Combing, washing, and braiding the hair were all troublesome.

　　Politically and practically, it would seem that cutting off queues would not be a problem. However, in fact, people like Li Sanye were not few in number. People had fought against shaving and keeping queues, but, hundreds of years later, in the year after the Xinhai Revolution, people regarded their queues as their "second lives," and some even committed suicide by jumping into the river because they were forced to cut off their queues, and some were driven mad by soldiers using sabers to cut off their queues. As for fighting and quarreling over cutting off queues, that was too common. Those who refused to cut off their queues included not only Qing loyalists but also all sorts of people, including Manchus and Hans. In order to find a "theoretical basis" for refusing to cut off queues, some people even quoted the words of the ancient sages: "Our body, hair, and skin are received from our parents; we dare not damage them. This is the beginning of filial piety." In fact, filial piety was just a guise; the real intention was that the original things, the things one was accustomed to, could not be changed. This unchangeable thing permeated every cell and every blood vessel in people's bodies. It had been connected to their flesh and blood for decades, and had been breathing with them for decades. It had become a whole. This thing could not be touched, because once it was touched, it would "affect the whole body," which would be equivalent to revolting against oneself. Therefore, after careful study, it can be understood that there were not many people who truly "feared that the emperor would return" to "sacrifice" for the queue. More people were trying to protect "things that cannot be changed." Around 1918, at Peking University, there was Professor Gu Hongming, who dragged a short queue like Li Sanye's and lectured on English literature on the podium. I haven't verified it, but I think this old gentleman was very likely to take his queue into the coffin with him. Perhaps he would also think that not cutting off the queue before entering the coffin was the most satisfying thing in his life.

　　Time is unforgiving. The things that Wang Shufang said were eyesores are long gone. Today, the questions of what is pleasing to the eye and what is pleasing to the heart, what is stubborn and what is not, whether to follow or not, have fallen on us, the bourgeois intellectuals. Bourgeois intellectuals must pass the socialist test, wash away the accumulated dust and old dirt on their bodies, make individualism stink, burn individualism to ashes, cut off their queues with a snap, and revolt against themselves. Recalling the feelings and experiences of Gu Hongming and Li Sanye in those years and the conclusions drawn by later generations, I think this is quite beneficial.

　　The test that we bourgeois intellectuals must now pass, can be said to be difficult and laborious, or it can be said to be easy and effortless. The problem depends on how people pass it. Is it to pass this test thoroughly, to bid farewell to the old self and old things forever, to unconditionally surrender to the working class? Or is it to try to gloss over this test, maintain a tenuous relationship with the old self and old things, and hide some weapons to feign surrender or falsely surrender to the working class? Taking the former path is difficult, requires effort, involves pain, and fragile people may cry and spend several sleepless nights, but in the end, they will gain the greatest happiness. Taking the latter path may be "easy" at the moment, may not require much effort, and may not feel any pain, but in the end, it will bring the greatest pain. Real life tells us: only the former path can be taken, while the latter path is impassable. "Stay if you agree, leave if you don't." In the old society, in some cases, this sentence might have carried some weight; in today's society, this sentence has lost all its meaning. It is good to stay if you agree, but you must also stay if you don't agree; it is good to agree, but you must also change to agree if you don't agree; and there is no way to leave. "Return the altar to the altar, return the temple to the temple." If bourgeois intellectuals do not thoroughly pass the socialist revolution test and do not willingly surrender to the working class, do they have another altar or temple to which they can return?

　　Those who resisted cutting off their queues during the Xinhai Revolution could pass that test relatively easily because even if you didn't cut off your queue, you still had your own "free market" and could still muddle through. And even if you walked outside with a queue, others might find it an eyesore, but it didn't cause much harm to others, and people slowly got used to it. However, today, if you want to keep the "queue" of bourgeois individualism and pass this great socialist test, it is not so simple or casual. First, because the old road is no longer open; second, because dragging the "queue" of individualism poisons society, and the masses will not agree; third, because dragging this "queue" will constantly clash with collectivism, new things are constantly emerging, and one feels that everything is not pleasing to the eye, not pleasing to the heart, not accustomed to, and not comfortable, and one cannot muddle through.

　　The great era has announced the death penalty for individualism. Intellectuals should be like petrels, welcoming the baptism of the storm and welcoming a new life. Dirty and smelly things like queues should be buried forever and ever.

    从剪辫子联想起来的
    杨东莼
    老舍同志的话剧“茶馆”的第二幕一开始，有个关于剪辫子问题的争论。裕泰茶馆老板娘王淑芳，劝跑堂的李三爷剪了他的小辫儿，认为那小辫儿“看着多么不顺眼”，跟那时的“大改良”的风气不调和；可是李三爷硬是要留着他的小辫儿，他先是怕“万一把皇上改回来呢？”后来他干脆回绝：“你觉得不顺眼，我还不顺心呢？”
    听了这段意在言外的顺眼、顺心之争，联想起我们自己今天要过社会主义关，才使我明白了一个道理：为什么四十七年前人们那样地顽固地不愿把辫子剪掉？
    四十七年前，剪辫子是个带政治性的运动。原先，汉人是不剃发的，把发全束在头顶上，成个髻儿。满清入关后，下令剃发，说是：“留头不留发，留发不留头。”为了反对剃发蓄辫，当时汉人曾进行过激烈的斗争，为此而死亡的人很多。现在串胡同的理发师挑上一付担子，担子一头有根竖杆儿。据说，满清入关后，这竖杆儿是悬挂“圣旨”的，上边写的，很可能就是“奉旨理发蓄辫”或“留头不留发，留发不留头”这类口号式的文句。又据说，这竖杆儿是悬挂人头的，以示儆于那些抗拒剃发蓄辫的人们。到了辛亥革命那一年，把辫子剪掉，竟然成为一个标志着民族革命的富有浓厚政治性的运动，它同当时游行打起“汉”字旗帜、出告示用“黄帝纪元”年份，都是互相联系着的。剪辫子说明两件事：反满，要“共和民国”和“文明”。因此，在剪辫子的问题上，成了当时新旧两派人物的分野：谁剪了辫子，就证明谁是进步的，“改了良”的，文明的，赞成民国的；而谁拒绝剪辫子，就证明谁是落后的，顽固的，留恋满清的。可见，从政治上来讲，这条辫子已经是非剪掉不可的了。
    再从生活上来讲，这条辫子也非剪掉不可。有辫子的人，行动、做活都不方便。和人打架得先把辫子盘起来，为的是不让对方抓住自己的辫子。梳头、洗发、结辫，都很费事。
    从政治上来讲，从生活上来讲，按说，剪辫子是不会成问题的了。然而，事实上，像李三爷那样的人却又不在少数。人们曾经为反抗剃发蓄辫作过斗争，但，几百年之后，在辛亥革命后一年当中，人们又把辫子当成了自己的“第二生命”，竟然有因被迫剪辫子而投河自尽的，有因被士兵用马刀来砍辫子而吓疯了的，至于因剪辫子而打架相骂，那就太寻常了。拒绝剪辫子的，除遗老遗少之外，还有各色人等，其中有满人，也有汉人。为了要替拒绝剪辫子寻找“理论根据”，有些人还引用了古圣人的话：“身体发肤，受之父母，不敢毁伤。孝之始也。”其实，孝不孝只是个幌子，真正的意图则是：本来的东西、习惯了的东西是改变不得的。这种改变不得的东西渗透在人们的每个细胞和每根血管里，血肉相连数十载，呼吸相通数十春，已经浑然成为一体。这东西是万万动不得的，一动，就要“牵一发而动全身”，等于自己革掉了自己的命。所以，细加研究，就可以明白，为辫子“殉节”，真正“怕皇上改回来”的人倒是不多，更多的人则是为了保卫“改变不得的东西”。1918年左右，在北京大学，有辜鸿铭教授，拖着李三爷那样的短小辫子，在讲坛上讲授英国文学。我没有去考证，但我想，这位老先生是很有可能把辫子带进棺材去了的。也许他还会认为在进棺材之前都还没有把辫子剪掉，是大慰平生的一件顶顺心的事儿。
    时间不留情。王淑芳所说的看不顺眼的事儿早就没有了。到如今，顺眼不顺眼、顺心不顺心、顽固不顽固、随着走不随着走的问题，落到我们资产阶级知识分子身上来了。资产阶级知识分子要过社会主义这一关，要一洗自己身上的积尘旧垢，要把个人主义搞臭，要把个人主义烧得一干二净，要咔嚓一下地剪掉辫子，要自己革自己的命，回想一下辜鸿铭、李三爷当年的心情和际遇以及后人给他们下的结论，我认为这倒是蛮有益处的事情。
    轮到我们资产阶级知识分子而今要过的这一关，说艰难、说费劲可以，说容易、说不费劲也可以，问题决定于人们是一个怎样的过法。是彻底地过这一关，是坚决地与旧我、旧东西永诀，是毫无条件地向工人阶级缴械投降呢？还是打算遮遮掩掩地滑过这一关，和旧我、旧东西保持藕断丝连的关系，隐藏一部分枪械向工人阶级诈降或假降呢？走前一条路，是艰难的，需要费一把劲，有痛苦，脆弱的人可能要痛哭，要熬上几个不眠之夜，但最终会得到最大的快乐。走后一条路，目前可能“容易”一点，可能不费大劲儿，也可能不感到什么痛苦，但最终会得到最大的痛苦。现实生活告诉我们：只有前一条路可走，而后一条路是走不通的。“合则留，不合则去。”在旧社会，在某些情况下，这句话还许有点斤两；在今天的社会里，这句话已经丧失了它的全部意义。合固然要留，不合也要留；合固然好，不合也要改变为合；而去是没有路子的。“有坛归坛，有庙归庙。”不彻底地过社会主义革命这一关，不甘心情愿地向工人阶级缴械投降，难道资产阶级知识分子另外还有一个可以归趋的什么坛、什么庙不成？
    辛亥革命时那些抗拒剪辫子的人，比较容易地走过那一关，因为你不剪辫子，也还有你自己的“自由市场”，照样可以混日子。并且你拖着辫子在外面走，别人虽瞧着不顺眼，但毕竟于人无多大损害，人们慢慢地见怪不怪，也就算了。但是，今天要想留着资产阶级个人主义的“辫子”，过社会主义这一大关，却没有这么简单，也没有这么随便。一则因为老路已经不通；二则因为拖着个人主义的“辫子”，贻毒社会，群众不答应；三则因为拖着这根“辫子”，就会同集体主义处处顶撞，新事物不断涌现，而自己感到全不顺眼、不顺心、不习惯、不舒畅，日子也就混不下去。
    伟大的时代宣布了个人主义的死刑。知识分子应该像海燕一般，迎接暴风雨的洗礼，迎接新的生活。辫子之类的脏臭东西，应该永远地、永远地把它埋葬了。
