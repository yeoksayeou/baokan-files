Xinhua News Agency, London, April 26th: John Gollan, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, published an article in the London "Daily Worker" today, calling on the British people to participate in a nationwide movement to get rid of American control.

A large demonstration is scheduled to be held on June 29th in Trafalgar Square, London, with the participation of 20,000 representatives from all over Britain. This day will be called "British Independence Day." Gollan pointed out that so many people are gathering together because they have a common demand for "peace, work, and British independence."

He pointed out that these 20,000 people will raise the demands that are being made all over Britain: Britain should take the lead in negotiating with the Soviet Union now, regardless of whether the United States participates; hydrogen bomb testing should be stopped and hydrogen bombs should be banned.

He said: "In order to guarantee a lasting and solid peace, and to overcome the recession that is developing, we need to greatly change our foreign policy, and in particular, we should greatly reduce military spending."

He emphasized that the reason why Britain cannot do this is because it is bound by the United States. He said: The main members of the Conservative Party leadership have long ceased to represent Britain. These people, in order to protect their profits, have sought the help of wealthy American capitalists, thus becoming obedient little partners with the United States in preparing for a nuclear war of aggression.

Gollan also said: The cold wind of unemployment is blowing across the coalfields and factories. The Conservative Party needs a large army of unemployed people to deal with those who demand wage increases. Therefore, the demonstration on June 29th will also demonstrate the will of the British workers: they will unite and support all forms of struggle that demand wage increases, and also support actions to resist those practices that reduce wages in a concealed way (such as the abolition of rent restrictions).

Gollan concluded by saying: The Communist Party supports all movements that fight for peace, for higher wages, for the independence of Britain, and for the defeat of the Conservative Party.

    为摆脱美国控制而斗争
    高兰号召英国人民参加“英国独立日”
    新华社伦敦26日电　英国共产党总书记约翰·高兰今天在伦敦“工人日报”上发表文章，呼吁英国人民参加为摆脱美国控制而斗争的全国性运动。
    预定6月29日将在伦敦特拉法加广场上举行一次有英国各地代表两万人参加的大示威，这一天将被叫做“英国独立日”。高兰指出，这样多的人聚集在一起，是由于他们对“和平、工作和英国的独立”有共同的要求。
    他指出，这两万人将提出英国全国到处都在提出的要求：英国应该现在就带头同苏联谈判，而不管美国是否参加；应该停止试验和取缔氢弹。
    他说：“为了保证持久的和巩固的和平，为了克服正在引导到（经济）衰退的情况，我们需要大大改变我们的外交政策，特别是应该大大削减军费。”
    他强调，英国之所以不能这样作，是因为受到美国的束缚。他说：保守党领袖中的主要成员长期以来已经不再代表英国。这些人为了保卫他们的利润而请求富裕的美国资本家的帮助，从而变成了同美国一起准备核侵略战争的从顺的小伙伴。
    高兰还说：失业的冷风正在吹过煤田和工厂。保守党需要一支失业大军来对付那些要求增加工资的人。因此，6月29日的示威也将表现出英国工人的这种意志：他们将团结一致，支持要求增加工资的一切形式的斗争，也支持对那种用隐蔽的方式来削减工资的作法（如取消房租限制）进行抵抗的行动。
    高兰最后说：共产党支持一切为和平、为争取提高工资和为英国的独立以及为击败保守党而斗争的运动。
