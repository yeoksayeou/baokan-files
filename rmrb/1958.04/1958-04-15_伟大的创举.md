    A Great Creation
    Li Jiye
    The solemn and magnificent bugle of peace has once again resounded in every corner of the world. The enemies of peace are frowning, and the friends of peace are singing with joy. Death merchants often spread dark clouds, and disasters constantly threaten human survival. The Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing fulfills the sacred responsibility of safeguarding peace. This is an incomparably great creation, as amazing as artificial satellites. The socialist camp is blooming with a hundred flowers, while the capitalist camp is in a state of wind and rain. The hearts of all good people in the world earnestly hope for lasting peace. The eyes of all good people in the world are gazing remotely at the red stars of Moscow.

    伟大的创举
    李霁野庄严雄伟的和平号角又一次响遍世界各个角落。和平的敌人愁眉苦脸，和平的友人欢笑高歌。死亡贩子经常密布乌云，灾难时时威胁人类生存。苏联单独停止核武器试验，尽了维护和平的神圣责任。这是一件伟大无比的创举，和人造卫星一样令人惊奇。社会主义阵营百花怒放，资本主义阵营风雨凄凄。全世界善良人民的心都殷殷期望着持久和平。全世界善良人民的眼都遥遥看望着莫斯科的红星。
