Liaoning Public Security Departments Solve a Large Number of Backlogged Cases
Criminals Greatly Affected; Masses Applaud

(Our report) In the great leap forward of public security work, public security organs in various parts of Liaoning Province, working hand-in-hand with the broad masses of people, recently cracked a large number of long-standing political and criminal cases. These included cases of Kuomintang-American special agents and spies who specifically sought to steal state secrets and endanger our national security, as well as counter-revolutionary groups and remnant counter-revolutionary cases. At the same time, they also uncovered a number of cases involving current sabotage activities, arrested a group of criminals who were hated by the people and had committed serious crimes according to law, and seized various reactionary documents and a large number of incriminating pieces of stolen goods from criminal offenders.

During this wave of cracking down on cases, public security organs in cities and counties such as Anshan, Jinzhou, and Haicheng cooperated to crack the long-hidden counter-revolutionary organization "Sino-American Liaison Command Northeast Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Headquarters." The case of twelve reactionary leaflets signed "Huaren" distributed in five districts of Shenyang City, including Shenhe and Beiguan, in 1957 was also cracked, and three criminals, including Cheng Chaoyue, were arrested according to law.

In addition, many major criminal cases such as habitual theft, burglary, murder, arson, rape, fraud, and poisoning were also solved. For example, Zhang Zhide was a habitual thief who had been wandering and stealing for twelve years. Although he had been reformed and educated and treated with leniency by the government twice after liberation, he continued to do evil. According to preliminary investigations, he wandered and stole countless times in Dashiqiao, Gaiping, Panshan, and Yingkou City alone from 1955 to 1957. This time, he was also caught by the Yingkou City Public Security Bureau.

This powerful offensive to solve cases initially presented an overwhelming momentum. Leading cadres personally went to the battlefield to command or directly participate in the battle. All police officers and public security commissioners from all public security stations mobilized the masses everywhere to investigate overnight. Detectives and interrogators also expanded leads and verified materials, and heroic deeds of exchanging selfless revolutionary spirit for victory in battle continued to emerge in various places. In order to chase a fugitive, many public security officers traveled hundreds of miles, wearing stars and moons, enduring hunger. When the people in many places saw this spirit of hard work that was loyal to the people's cause, and saw the public security organs solve a case, they not only applauded and praised, but also beat gongs and drums and set off firecrackers to express their congratulations.

    辽宁公安部门侦破大批积案
    罪犯大受打击　群众拍手称快
    本报讯　辽宁省各地公安机关，在公安工作大跃进中，同广大人民群众并肩携手，不久之前破获了一大批多年积压的各种政治案件和刑事犯罪案件。其中有专门刺探我国家机密、危害我国安全的美蒋特务间谍案件，有反革命集团和残余反革命案件。同时，还破获了一批进行现行破坏活动的案件，依法逮捕了一批有民愤和罪行严重的犯罪分子，并缴获了各种反动证件，以及刑事犯罪分子盗窃的大批罪证赃物。
    在这次破案高潮中，鞍山、锦州、海城等市县公安机关协同作战，破获了潜伏已久的反革命组织“中美联络指挥所东北反共救国军总部”。1957年在沈阳市沈河、北关等五个区连续散发十二起以“华人”署名的反动传单案，也在这次破案，依法逮捕了程朝钺等三名罪犯。
    此外还破获了很多惯盗、惯窃、凶杀、纵火、强奸、诈骗、毒害等重大刑事案件。如张志德是流窜行窃达十二年之久的惯犯，解放后虽经政府两次改造教育和宽大处理，但仍继续作恶。据初步查证，仅1955年到1957年间，在大石桥、盖平、盘山及营口市等地就流窜行窃无数次，这次也被营口市公安局查获。
    这一次强有力的破案攻势，一开始就呈现出排山倒海的气势。领导干部都亲临战场指挥或直接参加战斗。所有公安派出所的民警和公安特派员都到处发动群众，连夜调查。侦察人员、审讯人员也扩大线索，查证材料，以忘我的革命精神来换取战斗胜利的英雄事迹，在各地不断涌现。不少公安人员为追赶一个逃犯，披星戴月，忍饥挨饿，追踪几百里。不少地方的人民群众见到这种忠于人民事业的苦斗精神，见到公安机关破获一案，不仅鼓掌赞扬，而且鸣锣敲鼓、燃放鞭炮表示庆贺。
