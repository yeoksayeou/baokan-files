Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: The State Council recently approved and transmitted a joint report from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Light Industry on promoting increased production of oil crops and oils.

The State Council's instruction stated: Vegetable oil is a necessity for the people's lives. Therefore, all localities must give full attention to oil crop production. During the Second Five-Year Plan, especially under the current situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, it is necessary to vigorously increase oil crop production while prioritizing the development of grain production. The instruction requires the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, as well as all relevant departments, to actively plan leap forward targets for oil crop and oil production and to adopt and implement various effective measures to increase production. Strive to greatly increase the level of vegetable oil production during the Second Five-Year Plan.

In the joint report submitted to the State Council by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Light Industry, the facts of large-scale high yields of peanuts in Hong'an County, Hubei, and rapeseed in Xinghua County, Jiangsu, were listed, indicating that the potential for oil crop production is great, and that increasing production is achievable as long as more importance is attached to oil crop production work. At the same time, the benefits and prospects of widely promoting the planting of sunflowers and other crops were also elaborated.

The report stated: According to the existing ratio of crop production, in addition to some grain-producing areas that can appropriately increase the planting area of oil crops, the main way to increase oil crop production should be to actively promote production-increasing measures, increase the unit area yield of existing oil crops, and develop woody oil crops, sunflowers, castor beans, and other aspects.

In order to improve the enthusiasm of farmers for planting oil crops, the report put forward a series of measures in terms of agricultural production, economic work, and processing.

(1) Agricultural production:

    1. Strengthen specific leadership and planning for oil crop production. Local People's Committees at all levels should list oil crop production as a major part of developing diversified agriculture and include it in the important agenda of leading production. Provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government, and key producing areas at the prefecture and county levels are required to adjust and strengthen the staffing of specialized personnel for oil crop production within the existing establishment.
    2. Summarize and promote high-yield experiences and strengthen guidance on cultivation techniques. Further strengthen experimental research on oil crops, cultivate superior varieties, and do a good job in breeding and maintaining the purity of improved varieties. It is required that by 1962, major oil crops will basically achieve universal adoption of improved varieties. Areas with suitable conditions can also promote various mature intercropping experiences of oil crops and other crops according to local conditions. Industrial departments should vigorously cooperate with agricultural departments to carry out the above tasks.

(2) Economic work:

    1. Improve the purchase and allocation of oil crops, and it is recommended that the state implement a differential allocation management method for provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government in the future. Importing areas are required to achieve self-sufficiency within a specified period, achieving production self-sufficiency within the next one to three years.
    2. Regarding the reasonable price ratio of oil crops and oil cake and the supply of cake fertilizer. The exchange ratio of oil crops and oil cake in the same oil crop producing area and at the same time should generally be that 80 jin of oil crops can exchange for at least 100 jin of oil cake produced from this oil crop. In order to ensure that oil cake can be used by farmers in a timely manner, indigenous oil presses should be operated and managed by agricultural cooperatives as much as possible; the state should adopt the method of collecting more oil and less raw materials, and formulate the ratio of oil collection to raw material collection according to local conditions.
    3. Strengthen the purchase of small oil crops (sunflowers, castor beans, perilla, etc.). In townships, all grain and oil purchase and sales stations should universally purchase them, and organize mobile purchases in villages and cooperatives or entrust supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase them on their behalf; in cities, grain supply stores and non-staple food supply stores can purchase them with signs, or entrust waste product mobile purchase teams to purchase them on their behalf. The price of small oil crops should also be appropriately adjusted according to national needs and their economic value.
    4. Actively purchase and utilize wild oil crops. In order to encourage the development of wild oil crops in various regions, where wild oils are used for industrial purposes, the edible oil saved can be used to increase the supply to the masses locally, and the state will not reduce its distribution quota.

(3) Industrial aspects:

    1. Fully utilize indigenous pressing methods; conscientiously implement the construction policy of focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises and running more small factories. Industrial departments at all levels need to vigorously assist indigenous oil presses in summarizing and promoting advanced experience, and provide necessary technical guidance; carry out necessary and possible technical modifications to indigenous pressing equipment to reduce labor intensity. The construction of oil factories should fully implement the spirit of serving the rural economy, and more small factories should be built in small towns, mountainous areas, and villages lacking indigenous pressing, so as to process oil crops locally as much as possible. At present, we should especially strengthen the design and manufacture of equipment for small factories.
    2. Oil factories should gradually change from commissioned processing to self-operation. In order to improve the production enthusiasm of enterprise employees, in areas with suitable conditions, the industry and commerce departments can fully negotiate and report to the People's Committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government for approval before changing from processing to self-operation; some areas can first organize pilot projects, and then promote them after gaining experience.

### 大大提高植物油生产水平  国务院批转农业部、粮食部、轻工业部的报告

    大大提高植物油生产水平
    国务院批转农业部、粮食部、轻工业部的报告
    新华社23日讯　国务院最近批转了农业部、粮食部、轻工业部关于促进油料油脂增产问题的联合报告。
    国务院的批示说：植物油为人民生活的必需品，因此，各地对于油料生产必须予以充分重视。在第二个五年计划期间，特别是在目前工农业生产大跃进的形势下，必须在优先发展粮食生产的同时，大力提高油料生产。批示要求各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会和各主管部门积极规划油料、油脂生产的跃进指标，并且采取各项有效的增产措施，贯彻执行。力争在第二个五年计划期间，大大提高植物油的生产水平。
    在农业部、粮食部、轻工业部向国务院所作的联合报告中，列举了湖北红安县的花生和江苏兴化县的菜籽等大面积丰产的事实，说明油料生产的潜力很大，只要进一步重视油料生产工作，增产是大有可为的。同时，对于大量推广种植向日葵等的好处和前途也作了阐述。
    报告中说：根据现有农作物生产的比例关系，除某些粮食产区可以适当地增加油料种植面积以外，增产油料的主要途径应当放在积极推行增产措施，提高现有油料的单位面积产量，发展木本油料、向日葵、蓖麻等方面。
    为了提高农民种植油料的积极性，报告中在农业生产、经济工作及加工等方面提出了一系列的措施。
    （一）农业生产方面：
    1、加强对油料生产的具体领导和规划。地方各级人民委员会应当把油料生产列为发展农业的多种经济的主要内容，纳入领导生产的重要议程内。并且要求省、自治区、直辖市一级及重点产区的专、县，在现有编制内调整配备和加强油料生产的专业人员。
    2、总结和推广丰产经验，加强栽培技术的指导。进一步加强油料的试验研究工作，培育优良品种，做好良种的繁育、保纯等工作。要求到1962年主要油料作物达到基本上普及良种。有条件的地区，还可因地制宜地推广各项成熟的油料作物和其它农作物的间作经验。工业部门应当大力配合农业部门进行上述各项工作。
    （二）经济工作方面：
    1、改进油料的收购及调拨工作，并且建议国家今后对各省、自治区、直辖市实行差额调拨管理办法。对调入区要求限期自给，分别在今后一年至三年内达到生产自给。
    2、关于油料、油饼的合理比价及饼肥供应问题。油料与油饼在同一油料产地、同一时期内的交换比例，一般应当是油料八十斤，至少能换到这种油料所生产的油饼一百斤。为了使油饼能及时供农民使用，土榨油坊应当尽量由农业社自行经营管理；国家采取多收油、少收料的办法，根据各地具体情况拟定收油收料的比例。
    3、加强对小油料（向日葵、蓖麻、苏子等）的收购。在乡、镇，所有的粮油购销站做到普遍收购，并且组织串乡、串社流动收购或委托供销社代购；在城市中，可由粮食供应店和副食品供应店挂牌收购，或委托废品流动收购小组代购。小油料的价格，也应当根据国家需要及其经济价值，作适当的调整。
    4、积极收购、利用野生油料。为了鼓励各地发展野生油料，凡以野生油脂作为工业用的，其所节省下来的食用油部分，可以就地增加群众的供应量，国家不减少其分配指标。
    （三）工业方面：
    1、充分利用土榨；切实贯彻执行以中小型为主、多办小厂的建设方针。各级工业部门需要大力协助土榨油坊进行总结、推广先进经验，给予必要的技术指导；对于土榨设备进行必要与可能的技术改造，以减轻劳动强度。油厂的建设应当充分贯彻为农村经济服务的精神，在缺乏土榨的小城镇、山区及乡村多办小厂，尽量做到油料就地加工。目前应当特别加强对小厂设备的设计和制造工作。
    2、油厂逐步由委托加工改为自营。为了提高企业职工的生产积极性，在有条件的地区，可由工商部门充分协商，报各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会批准后由加工改为自营；有些地区可以先组织试点，待取得经验后再行推广。
