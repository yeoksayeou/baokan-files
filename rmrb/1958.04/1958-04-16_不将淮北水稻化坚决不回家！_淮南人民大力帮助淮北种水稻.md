"We Will Not Return Home Until Huaibei is Converted to Rice Paddies!"
Hainan People Vigorously Help Huaibei Plant Rice

Hefei, April 15th (This newspaper dispatch) – Anhui Province is adopting the method of "inviting in, sending out, and relocating technology" to transmit rice planting techniques from the areas along the Yangtze River and in Huainan to the Huaibei Plain. This year, the area in the Huaibei region converted to rice cultivation will increase from one million mu last year to eight million mu.

Since 1953, a total of more than 10,000 farmers have been transferred from the areas along the Yangtze River and in Huainan to Huaibei to teach rice planting techniques, and farmers have been sent from Huaibei to the areas along the Yangtze River and in Huainan to learn rice planting techniques. This year, in order to expand the area converted to rice cultivation, the eighteen counties of Huaibei have universally signed contracts with the counties in the rice-producing areas along the Yangtze River and in Huainan on a one-to-one basis. Those invited in include not only farmers, but also cadres at the county, district, and township levels, as well as carpenters, ironworkers, and other handicraft workers, totaling more than 3,600 people.

The Huaibei Plain used to be abundant in dry-land crops such as beans, wheat, and sorghum, and there was no habit of planting rice. However, Huaibei is fully capable of growing rice. The annual rainfall in Huaibei is about 700 to 800 millimeters, with about 400 to 500 millimeters concentrated in the summer and autumn seasons. Such rainfall is too much for dry-land crops; if it is too concentrated, it often causes waterlogging disasters. If rice is grown instead, it can be fully utilized. However, some farmers in Huaibei say, "Huaibei has leaky soil and cannot grow rice"; some farmers say, "Huaibei has always grown dry-land crops. Each piece of land nourishes its own people. If rice could be grown, our ancestors would have grown it long ago." In addition to ideological problems, technology is also a practical problem. Huaibei farmers do not know how to grow rice, nor have they seen what rice planting looks like.

In order to solve the ideological problems and practical difficulties in converting Huaibei to rice cultivation, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to transfer a large number of farmers with rice-growing experience from the rice-producing areas along the Yangtze River and in Huainan to Huaibei to teach techniques, and at the same time transfer a portion of farmers from Huaibei to the areas along the Yangtze River and in Huainan to learn rice-growing techniques. Starting in 1953, from a few pilot projects to multi-point demonstrations, this year it has developed into a contracting method of one county covering one county. The advanced farming systems and farming techniques of rice cultivation along the Yangtze River and in Huainan are systematically transmitted to the Huaibei Plain. By last year, the entire Huaibei had converted more than one million mu to rice cultivation. The rice crops that were converted have all had good harvests, with yields generally one to several times higher than the yields of other local grains. Last year, the rice crops converted in the Fuyang Special District had more than 10,000 mu with yields of more than 500 jin per mu. Among them, there were 1,671 mu with yields of more than 700 jin per mu, and the highest yield reached 1,361 jin per mu. Many low-lying areas in Huaibei that "failed to harvest nine years out of ten" have achieved bumper harvests since they were converted to rice cultivation. The conservative ideas of some farmers in Huaibei, such as "Huaibei has leaky soil and cannot grow rice," have been shattered by eloquent facts. Converting to rice cultivation has taken root in the hearts of the people in Huaibei, and rice-growing techniques have been widely spread and have taken root in various parts of Huaibei. According to incomplete statistics, in Bengbu Special District alone in 1956, 300,000 people in various counties learned rice-growing techniques.

"Implement a water network and rice cultivation in Huaibei!" "Transform Huaibei into Jiangnan!" This is the bold slogan put forward by the people of Huaibei. Now, the farmers transferred to Huaibei from the areas along the Yangtze River and in Huainan are working together with the local farmers in Huaibei to carry out various agricultural activities for converting to rice cultivation. They stated: "We will not return home until Huaibei is converted to rice paddies!"

### “不将淮北水稻化坚决不回家！”  淮南人民大力帮助淮北种水稻

    “不将淮北水稻化坚决不回家！”
    淮南人民大力帮助淮北种水稻
    本报合肥15日电　安徽省采用“请进来，派出去，把技术搬家”的办法，将沿江和淮南种水稻的技术传到了淮北平原。今年淮北区改种水稻将由去年的一百万亩增加到八百万亩。
    从1953年以来，先后从沿江和淮南调到淮北传授种水稻技术的农民，从淮北派到沿江和淮南学习种水稻技术的农民，共计已有一万多人。今年，淮北十八个县为了扩大改种水稻的面积，已普遍与沿江、淮南水稻产区的各个县一个对一个地订立了合同，请进来的，不仅有农民，还有县、区、乡各级干部和木工、铁工等手工业工人，共三千六百多人。
    淮北平原过去盛产豆、麦、高粱等旱粮作物，没有种水稻的习惯。但是淮北却完全有种水稻的条件。淮北年雨量约有七百至八百公厘，雨量集中在夏秋季的约有四百至五百公厘。这样的雨量对旱粮作物嫌多，如果过分集中，往往造成涝灾；如果改种水稻，正好充分利用。但是，淮北有些农民说“淮北是漏风土，不能种水稻”；有些农民说“淮北历来就种旱粮，哪一方土养哪一方人，如果能种水稻，我们的祖宗早就种了”；除了思想上的问题以外，技术也是个实际问题。淮北农民不会种水稻，也没有见过种水稻的样子。
    中共安徽省委为了解决淮北改种水稻中的思想问题和实际困难，决定从沿江和淮南的水稻产区大批抽调有种水稻经验的农民到淮北去传授技术，同时从淮北调一部分农民到沿江和淮南学习种水稻的技术。从1953年开始，由少数试点，到多点示范，今年又发展到一县包一县的包干办法。有计划地把沿江和淮南种水稻的先进耕作制度和耕作技术传到淮北平原，到去年整个淮北已改种水稻一百多万亩。改种的水稻收成都很好，产量一般比当地其他粮食产量高一倍到几倍。阜阳专区去年改种的水稻，每亩产量五百斤以上的有一万多亩。其中每亩产量七百斤以上的有一千六百七十一亩，最高每亩达到一千三百六十一斤。淮北很多“十年九不收”的洼地，自从改种水稻以后，都获得丰收。原来淮北有些农民认为“淮北是漏风土，不能种水稻”等保守思想，已被雄辩的事实粉碎了。改种水稻在淮北已经深入人心，种水稻的技术已经在淮北各地广泛传开，扎下了根。据不完全统计，仅蚌埠专区1956年一年，各县学会种水稻技术的就有三十万人。
    “淮北实行水网化水稻化”！“变淮北为江南！”这是淮北人民提出的豪迈的口号。现在，从沿江和淮南调到淮北的农民正和淮北当地的农民一起，紧张地进行各种改种水稻的农事活动。他们表示：“不将淮北水稻化，坚决不回家！”
