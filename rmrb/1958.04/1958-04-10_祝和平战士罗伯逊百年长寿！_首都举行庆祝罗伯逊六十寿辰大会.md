Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: The Chinese people held a grand meeting in Beijing this afternoon to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of American black singer Paul Robeson.

The meeting was jointly convened by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's Association of Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Chinese Musicians Association. More than 1,000 representatives from literary and art circles and various fields in the capital attended the meeting. Guo Moruo, the host of the meeting, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, warmly praised Robeson as an outstanding singer with a reputation in the world music scene, a staunch fighter for the liberation of black people and the defense of world peace, and a loyal friend of peace-loving people all over the world.

Guo Moruo, after emphasizing Robeson's deep feelings for the Chinese and Soviet people, stressed that precisely because Robeson stands on the side of peace and justice, he has been deprived of the freedom to travel and perform by the American government from 1950 to the present. "This shows that the capitalist democracy represented by the United States is completely hypocritical, and the American people do not enjoy true freedom. Fearing Robeson's singing, fearing peace, fully demonstrates the essence of imperialism."

Zhao Feng, Standing Director of the Chinese Musicians Association, then gave a report entitled "Peace Fighter, Art Master, Great American Citizen, Friend of the Chinese People," introducing Robeson's significant contributions to the development of people's art and the defense of human peace and progress over the decades. Robeson's Chinese friends, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, and Liu Liangmo, Standing Committee Member of the National Committee of the All-China Youth Federation, in their speeches at the meeting, emphasized that Robeson was concerned about the Chinese people's struggle as early as the Anti-Japanese War, and after China's liberation, he always longed to visit our country and had extremely deep feelings for New China.

The meeting adopted a congratulatory telegram to Robeson and read out congratulatory telegrams to Robeson from Guo Moruo, Chairman of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Chu Tunan, President of the Association for Cultural Exchange with Foreign Countries, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture, and Lü Ji, Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, and Vice Chairmen Ma Sicong and He Luting.

    祝和平战士罗伯逊百年长寿！
    首都举行庆祝罗伯逊六十寿辰大会
    据新华社9日讯　中国人民庆祝美国黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊六十寿辰大会今天下午在北京隆重举行。
    大会由中国人民保卫世界和平委员会、中国人民对外文化协会、中国文学艺术界联合会和中国音乐家协会联合召开。出席大会的有首都文艺界和各界代表共一千多人。大会主持人、和大和全国文联主席郭沫若在会上热情地称颂罗伯逊是在世界乐坛上享有声誉的卓越歌手，是争取黑人解放和保卫世界和平的坚强战士，是全世界爱好和平的人民的忠实朋友。
    郭沫若在着重谈到罗伯逊对中国人民和苏联人民所抱有的深厚感情以后强调指出，正因为罗伯逊是站在和平与正义的立场，因而从1950年到现在他一直被美国政府剥夺了旅行和演唱的自由。“这说明着美国所代表的资本主义民主是彻底虚伪的，美国人民并没有享受真正的自由。害怕罗伯逊的歌声，害怕和平，就充分表明了帝国主义的本质。”
    中国音乐家协会常务理事赵沨接着在会上作了题为“和平战士、艺术大师、伟大的美国公民、中国人民的朋友”的报告，介绍了罗伯逊几十年来为发展人民艺术和保卫人类和平与进步所作出的重大贡献。罗伯逊的中国朋友、文化部副部长钱俊瑞和中华全国民主青年联合会全国委员会常务委员刘良模先后在会上的讲话，着重谈到罗伯逊早在抗日战争时期就关心着中国人民的斗争，中国解放后他更时时向往着能来我国访问，对新中国怀有极深厚的感情。
    大会通过了致罗伯逊的贺电和宣读了全国文联主席郭沫若，对外文化协会会长楚图南，文化部副部长钱俊瑞，中国音协主席吕骥、副主席马思聪和贺绿汀等人致罗伯逊的贺电。
