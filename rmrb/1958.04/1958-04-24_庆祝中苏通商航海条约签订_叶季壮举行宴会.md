Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: At the banquet hosted tonight by Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the 1958 Goods Exchange Protocol, Minister Kabanov and Deputy Minister Li Zheren both pointed out that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has significant economic and political importance, and the treaty creates more favorable conditions for further developing long-term economic and trade relations between the two countries.

    The entire Soviet government trade delegation was invited to attend the banquet. Also present at the banquet were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to China Antonov, and relevant Chinese personnel involved in the Sino-Soviet trade negotiations.

    In his speech at the banquet, Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade Kabanov said that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Commerce and Navigation not only has important economic significance, but also has great political significance. The treaty demonstrates the desire of the Soviet Union and China to further develop long-term trade relations and creates more and better conditions for both sides to develop long-term trade. He also said that the 1958 Goods Exchange Protocol signed by both sides not only stipulates an increase in trade volume, but also adds new exchange commodities, which means that the two countries will further develop and consolidate their trade relations based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and will ensure a more planned approach to meeting the needs of economic development in both countries.

    Kabanov emphasized that the biggest guarantee for the continuous development of Sino-Soviet economic and trade relations is the leadership of the Communist Parties of the two countries, which have the same goals and are guided by the same ideological principles. He also said that the Soviet Union and China are like two giants, and their unity and friendship cannot be destroyed by any force.

    Minister Ye Jizhuang was unable to attend the banquet tonight due to illness. Deputy Minister Li Zheren delivered a speech on his behalf at the banquet, saying that the Sino-Soviet trade negotiations were victoriously completed in a spirit of active cooperation on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Commerce and Navigation signed today fixes the economic and trade relations between China and the Soviet Union over the past few years in the form of a treaty, laying a more solid foundation for the further development of economic and trade relations between the two countries. The signing of this treaty also creates extremely favorable conditions for the further development of long-term trade between the two countries. Experience over the past few years has proven that long-term trade is an important measure for fraternal countries to develop economic cooperation in a planned way. He said that he hopes that more comprehensive long-term trade agreements can be signed between the two countries in the future in order to better promote the vigorous development of trade between the two countries.

    Li Zheren emphasized that the economy of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is thriving and rising day by day, and the unity among socialist countries is becoming closer. The fraternal economic and trade relations and the unbreakable great friendship between China and the Soviet Union will surely be further consolidated and developed.

    The banquet was filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere from beginning to end. Both hosts and guests repeatedly and warmly congratulated the strength and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and congratulated the further consolidation and development of the fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
