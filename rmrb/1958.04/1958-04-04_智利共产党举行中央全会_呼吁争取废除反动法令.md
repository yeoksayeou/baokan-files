    Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, April 2nd (via TASS): According to "El Siglo," the Chilean Communist Party recently held a Central Committee plenary session in Santiago. The plenary session elected Luis Corvalán as the General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party.

    The plenary session decided to call on all political parties and organizations to intensify their efforts to abolish the so-called "Law for the Defense of Democracy," because, according to this law, the trade union movement and many democratic parties, including the Communist Party, have been persecuted.

    The plenary session paid special attention to the sharp intensification of the domestic crisis and the increase in the number of unemployed and impoverished people. The plenary session adopted a resolution calling for strengthening the unity of trade unions and mass organizations and fighting to meet the demands of the masses.

    The plenary session emphasized that it is necessary to further strengthen the unity between the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, and to further strengthen the alliance with the various political parties participating in the "Popular Action Front." The plenary session called on all progressive forces in the country to unite around the "Popular Action Front" and strive for the victory of Salvador Allende in the presidential election to be held in September this year.

    智利共产党举行中央全会
    呼吁争取废除反动法令
    据新华社3日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯2日讯：据“世纪报”报道，智利共产党最近在圣地亚哥举行了中央委员会全体会议。全会选出路易士·科尔巴兰为智利共产党总书记。
    全会决定呼吁各个政党和团体加紧争取废除所谓“保卫民主法”，因为根据这项法律，工会运动和包括共产党在内的许多民主党派都遭到了迫害。
    全会特别重视国内危机尖锐化以及失业和贫困的人数增加等情况。全会通过了一项决议，要求加强各工会和群众团体的团结，为争取满足人民群众的要求而斗争。
    全会强调指出，必须进一步加强共产党和社会党的团结，进一步加强同参加“人民行动阵线”的各政党的联盟。全会号召全国一切进步力量团结在“人民行动阵线”的周围，争取在今年9月举行的总统选举中使萨尔瓦多·阿伦德获胜。
