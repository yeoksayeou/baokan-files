    New Opera Problems Discussion Collection
    Last year, the Chinese Dramatists Association and the Chinese Musicians Association jointly organized a new opera discussion meeting to study many important theoretical and practical issues in the development of new opera. Such as the concept of new opera, the historical evaluation of new opera, the foundation and direction of new opera, how new opera should inherit and promote the traditions of national opera, how to learn from the experiences of Soviet and Western opera, and issues related to new opera playwriting, composition, performance, singing, etc. In addition, the guidelines, tasks and administrative measures of new opera art groups were also discussed. The "New Opera Problems Discussion Collection" newly published by China Drama Publishing House is a selection and compilation based on important reports, speeches and related papers from the discussion meeting.

    新歌剧问题讨论集
    去年，中国戏剧家协会和中国音乐家协会联合组织了新歌剧讨论会，研究新歌剧发展中的有关理论上和实践上的许多重要问题。如新歌剧的概念，新歌剧的历史估价，新歌剧的基础和方向，新歌剧如何继承和发扬民族戏曲传统，如何学习苏联和西洋歌剧的经验，以及有关新歌剧剧作、作曲、表演、唱腔等问题。此外也讨论了新歌剧艺术团体的方针任务和行政措施等问题。中国戏剧出版社新出版的“新歌剧问题讨论集”，便是根据讨论会上的重要报告、发言以及有关论文，选辑汇编成的。
