Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 4th: Zhejiang Province's 23,000+ grain depots in 88 counties and cities have basically achieved "Four Withouts" (no insects, no mold, no rats or birds, no accidents) by the end of March, becoming the first province in the country to achieve "Four Withouts" grain depots. This was affirmed by the grain leadership departments of various counties and cities after inspections and reports to the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Bureau. On April 3rd, the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Bureau reported the good news to the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee, and the Ministry of Food.

Zhejiang Province achieved this success after three months of hard work. Since January this year, over 3,000 grain storage personnel throughout the province have greatly improved their socialist awareness through the rectification movement. Under the slogan of "The warehouse is the battlefield, tools are the weapons, one day is two days, the moon is the sun," a competition to compare, learn from, and catch up with the advanced has been launched between people and between warehouses. Grain protection teams composed of many cadres, workers, and residents around the grain depots have also actively joined this battle. After three months of hard work, a total of more than 137,000 rats and birds were eliminated from grain depots throughout the province, and approximately 2 billion jin of insect-infested grain, high-temperature grain, and high-moisture grain were processed.

The grain storage personnel in Zhejiang Province are currently pursuing their victories, making persistent efforts, and are determined to consolidate the "Four Withouts" grain depots and actively prepare to face the test of the plum rain and high-temperature seasons.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 4th: At the same time as Zhejiang Province achieved a "Four Withouts" grain depot province, Henan's grain depots have also basically achieved "Four Withouts."

As of the end of March, among the 124 counties and cities in the province, the grain warehouses in 115 counties and cities have reached the standard of no insects, no mold, no rats or birds, and no accidents in grain storage. The storage capacity of "Four Withouts" grain depots accounts for 96.56% of the total warehouse capacity.

    浙江省粮仓基本实现四无
    河南115县市的粮仓达“四无”标准
    据新华社杭州4日电　浙江省八十八个县、市的两万三千多间粮仓，已经在3月底基本上实现“四无”（无虫、无霉、无鼠雀、无事故），成为全国最先实现“四无”粮仓的省份，这是全省各县、市粮食领导部门经过检查向浙江省粮食厅汇报后肯定的。3日，浙江省粮食厅已向中共浙江省委、浙江省人民委员会和粮食部报喜。
    浙江省的这个成绩是经过苦战三个月后取得的。今年1月以来，全省三千多名粮食保管人员通过整风运动，社会主义觉悟大大提高，在“仓库当战场、工具当刀枪、一天当两天、月亮当太阳”的口号下，人与人和仓与仓之间展开了比先进、学先进、赶先进的竞赛。粮仓周围许多干部、工人和居民组成的护粮小组，也积极投入这一战斗。经过三个月的苦战，全省粮仓共消灭鼠雀十三万七千多只，处理了虫粮、高温粮、高水分粮约二十亿斤。
    浙江省的粮食保管人员目前正乘胜追击，再接再厉，决心把“四无”粮仓巩固下来，积极准备接受霉雨和高温季节的考验。
    据新华社郑州4日电　在浙江省实现“四无”粮仓省的同时，河南全省的粮仓也已基本上实现了“四无”。
    截至3月底止，全省一百二十四个县、市中，已有一百一十五个县、市的粮食仓库，达到了储粮无虫、无霉、无鼠雀、无事故的标准，“四无”粮仓的仓容量已占仓库总容量的96.56％。
