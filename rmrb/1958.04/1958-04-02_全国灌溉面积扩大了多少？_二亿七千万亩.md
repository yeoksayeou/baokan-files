Xinhua News Agency, April 1st – According to statistics from relevant departments as of March 31st, the completed farmland water conservancy projects nationwide can increase the irrigated area by more than 272.6 million mu. The revised 1958 plan to expand farmland irrigation area has been overfulfilled ahead of schedule by half a year. Currently, the movement to build farmland water conservancy continues to advance at an average rate of 3 million mu of expanded irrigation area per day.

The original 1958 plan was to expand the farmland irrigation area by 92.21 million mu (from October 1957 to September 1958). This plan was broken through by the revolutionary drive of farmers across the country by the end of January. In response to the farmers' growing enthusiasm, provinces and autonomous regions successively revised their plans, increasing the national 1958 plan to expand the farmland irrigation area to 260 million mu. Now, this plan has been broken through again. In total, in the six months since last October, the irrigated area expanded by newly built farmland water conservancy projects nationwide is equal to 120% of the irrigation area developed in the thousands of years before liberation, exceeding the irrigation area increased during the First Five-Year Plan by 30%, and two and a half times the actual achievements of the water conservancy upsurge in the winter of 1955 and spring of 1956.

    全国灌溉面积扩大了多少？
    二亿七千万亩
    据新华社1日讯　据有关部门截止3月31日统计，全国已经完工的农田水利工程，共可增加灌溉面积二亿七千二百六十多万亩，经过修订的1958年扩大农田灌溉面积计划已经提前半年超额完成。当前，兴修农田水利的运动仍以每天平均扩大灌溉面积三百万亩的速度继续向前发展。
    1958年原订扩大农田灌溉面积九千二百二十一万亩（从1957年10月起至1958年9月止），这个计划到1月末就已被全国农民的革命干劲所突破。针对农民越干越勇的情况，各省和自治区都先后修订了计划，使全国1958年扩大农田灌溉面积的计划增加到二亿六千万亩。现在，这个计划又被突破了。总计从去年10月起六个月中，全国新修农田水利工程扩大的灌溉面积，等于解放前几千年所发展的灌溉面积120％。超过第一个五年计划期间增加的灌溉面积30％。为1955年冬和1956年春那一次水利高潮完成实绩的两倍半。
