Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: Today, people of all ethnic groups in Beijing who believe in Islam celebrated Eid al-Fitr.

　　At the Dongsi Pailou Mosque, the largest mosque in the city, more than 1,300 Muslims from government organizations, schools, shops, and residential areas gathered to hold "Congregational Prayers." Guests from the Soviet Union, the United Arab Republic, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Afghanistan, and six other countries also attended the prayers. After the prayers, Da Putsheng and Zhang Jie, vice chairmen of the China Islamic Association, entertained them with refreshments.

　　In more than sixty larger mosques in Tianqiao, Niujie, and other areas, Muslims numbering from one hundred to one thousand, dressed neatly and joyfully, came to celebrate Eid al-Fitr. After bathing, they listened to the Ahong (Imam) reciting the Koran and expounding religious doctrines. In explaining the doctrines, the Ahongs combined it with patriotic propaganda, encouraging Muslims to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, April 21st: Muslims of all ethnic groups in Urumqi happily spent the first day of "Rozahait" (i.e., Eid al-Fitr) today. The most prominent phenomenon of this year's festival is that no beggars asking for food or money could be seen at the entrances of the city's fifty-five mosque neighborhoods during the congregational prayers.

　　In the morning, as the sun crossed the snow-capped Bogda Peak, the joyful festival began. Thousands of Muslims, dressed in festive attire, went to various mosques for congregational prayers.

　　According to state regulations, Muslims of all ethnic groups working in state organs and enterprises receive a three-day holiday. However, this year, Muslims of all ethnic groups have proposed to break with convention and celebrate the festival, and they have already proposed reducing the holiday to two days.

　　Today, cadres and residents of Han, Mongolian, Manchu, and other ethnic groups who do not believe in Islam also congratulated the Muslims on the festival. The streets and alleys were filled with people celebrating the festival. Muhammatjan Makhsum, vice chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference, and responsible persons of the Urumqi Political Consultative Conference also visited the homes of Emin Makhsum, vice chairman of the China Islamic Association, and Haji Gani Ayaji, vice chairman of the Xinjiang Islamic Association, today to pay their respects.

    北京、新疆穆斯林欢度开斋节
    据新华社21日讯　今天，北京市信仰伊斯兰教的各族人民欢度了开斋节。
    在全市最大的清真寺——东四牌楼清真寺里，一千三百多个来自机关、学校、商店和居民区的穆斯林会聚在一起，举行了“会礼”。在这里做礼拜的还有苏联、阿拉伯联合共和国、巴基斯坦、印度、印度尼西亚、阿富汗等六个国家的来宾，礼拜以后，中国伊斯兰教协会副主任达浦生、张杰并以茶点招待他们。
    在天桥、牛街等六十多个较大的清真寺里，也各有一百人到一千人左右的穆斯林，穿戴整齐、喜气盈盈地来庆祝开斋节。他们沐浴以后，听阿訇诵古兰经、讲教义。阿訇们在讲解教义中，都结合进行爱国主义宣传，鼓励穆斯林们积极参加祖国社会主义建设。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐21日电　乌鲁木齐市各族穆斯林今天高高兴兴地度过了“肉孜节”（即开斋节）的第一天。今年节日最突出的一个现象，是全市五十五个清真寺坊在聚礼时，寺门口再也看不见讨饭讨钱的人了。
    早晨，当太阳越过白雪皑皑的博格达山峰后，欢乐的节日开始。成千上万的穆斯林穿着节日的服装，到各个清真寺聚礼。
    按照国家规定，在国家机关和企业中工作的各族穆斯林都得到三天假期。但是今年各族穆斯林们都提出要打破常规过节，他们已经提出把假期减少为两天。
    今天，不信仰伊斯兰教的汉族、蒙古和满族等各族干部和居民，也纷纷向穆斯林们贺节。大街小巷，到处都是贺节的人们。自治区政协副主席木汉买提江·马合苏木和乌鲁木齐政协负责人等今天还到中国伊斯兰教协会副主任伊敏·马合苏木和自治区伊斯兰教协会副主任和加尼牙阿吉家中去拜节。
