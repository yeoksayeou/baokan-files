"Confederation" and "Federation"
    A "Confederation" is a combination of several sovereign states formed according to international treaties or agreements made under international law. The characteristic of a "Confederation" is that each member state retains its own internal affairs and foreign policy independence and is a fully sovereign state, that is, a member of the international community. A "Confederation" has its own organs, but its powers are limited to acting on member states and cannot directly bind the citizens of member states. The main and only organ of the "Confederation" is a parliament composed of representatives from each member state. The power of the parliament is an international power that does not affect the sovereignty of the member states.
    A "Federation" is a composite state. It acts as a single subject of international law in foreign relations. The main characteristic of a federal state is its single external sovereignty. However, this does not preclude member states from directly participating in foreign activities within a certain scope. There have been many forms of "Confederation" in history. In the history of the German people, from 1815 to 1871, for fifty-five years, there was a Confederation of the German Nation until Germany was unified in 1871. The Soviet Union and the United States both went through this form of state union on the road to unification.

    “邦联”和“联邦”
    “邦联”是几个主权国家按照国际条约或根据国际法订立的协定而结成的组合。“邦联”的特点是各成员国仍然保持自己的内政和外交独立，是主权完整的国家，也就是国际社会的成员。“邦联”有它自己的机关，但它的权限有一定的限制，只能对各成员国起作用，而不能直接约束各成员国的公民。“邦联”主要和唯一的机关，就是由各成员国派代表组成的一个议会。议会的权力是一种国际性的权力，对各成员国的主权没有影响。
    “联邦”是一种复合国。它在对外关系上作为单一的国际法主体。联邦国家的主要特征是它的单一的对外主权。但是，这并不排斥各成员国在一定范围内，直接参加对外活动。历史上有过不少“邦联”的形式。在德国人民的历史上，从1815到1871年的五十五年之间，曾组成了德意志民族的邦联，直到1871年德国才告统一。苏联和美国都曾经过这种国家联合的形式走上统一的道路。
