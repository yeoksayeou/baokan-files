    Huiming and Jia Gui
    Ge De
    In the high tide of the production leap forward, people compare their enthusiasm to the ancient Wu Song, Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, Luo Cheng, and Mu Guiying, believing that the images of these people can display the heroic qualities of the working people. This metaphor is vivid and colorful. But besides this, I also thought of the monk Huiming in "Romance of the West Chamber."
    Sun Feihu led 5,000 soldiers and horses to besiege Puji Temple, forcing the temple to hand over Yingying. Although Zhang Sheng came up with a delaying tactic and made a plan to invite the White Horse General to capture the thief and relieve the siege, to realize this plan, someone had to break through the siege to deliver the letter. At this moment, the entire key to the success or failure of the matter rested solely on the person delivering the letter. But who dared to go? Who had the courage and ability to break through the encirclement of 5,000 soldiers and horses alone? With a loud shout, the monk Huiming stepped forward.
    In Puji Temple, Huiming was not an important figure, but just a fire-lighting monk. However, he didn't take a general and 5,000 soldiers seriously, only asking the monks to "boost his morale by drumming a few times, and relying on the power of the Buddha to shout once." He then took a "black dragon tail steel rod" and on foot, "killed his way out of the tiger's den and dragon's pool," and finally invited the White Horse General.
    There is no need to say here how great his merit was. What is worth learning is his precious spirit. First, he acted bravely for a just cause, disregarding personal gains and losses. In his view, eliminating violence and maintaining peace was a righteous act. He resolutely took this major event upon himself. He didn't pretend to be stupid like others, but was "brave and unashamed." He also wasn't like Zhang Sheng, who only offered ideas and wrote letters to ask for reinforcements in order to marry Yingying. He wasn't actually just provoked into action, as the old monk said. His two lines to Zhang Sheng, "I have always been decisive and consistent, unlike you who are frivolous and indecisive," clearly show that he has always been acting bravely for a just cause, and not doing things for "frivolous" reasons like Zhang Sheng.
    Second, he was extremely brave and dared to despise the enemy. The old monk asked him if he dared to deliver the letter? He said: You all say that Sun Feihu's reputation is known throughout the world, but in my opinion, he is just a lustful, greedy, and useless fellow. This is how he viewed those 5,000 people, "Seeing heroes under the embroidered flag from afar, I will teach those tens of thousands of thieves to be frightened out of their wits." This shows how much he despised the enemy.
    Third, he was not restricted by rules and regulations, and had no servility. He did not lose the courage to take on this important task because of his humble status. The fact that he was "aroused to heroism at the sight of bloodshed" is enough to show that he dared to act. He mocked Zhang Sheng to his face for only making promises for the sake of marriage, showing that he felt his status was not lower than those scholars, the Xiangguo lady, and the young lady. He even despised them.
    This kind of bravery for a just cause, great courage and fearlessness, and daring to speak and act, is truly a valuable quality of the Chinese working people. It is a noble style, with no trace of servility. It is very worthy of learning and carrying forward.
    Speaking of servile character, one cannot help but think of Jia Gui in "Fa Men Temple." This person is the adopted son of the grand eunuch Liu Jin. In the old society, it was not shameful to be reduced to the status of a slave. What was shameful and terrible was being willing to be a slave and deliberately putting on a slave-like appearance. Jia Gui is such a character that makes the audience laugh and scold. He is very active in the play, but if you count his lines, the word he says the most is "Za!" He only speaks when conveying Liu Jin's words, and otherwise, he only has the role of saying "Za!" along with Liu Jin. This person not only dares not think, but also has no "thought" other than Liu Jin's thought, and takes pride in this, being very comfortable with this state. This is a typical example of utter servility.
    Now, in our country, there are no people who consciously consider themselves slaves and are comfortable with their slave status, but there are probably still people who dare not think and cannot think, and are comfortable with this state, thinking they are being clever. For these people, there should be a self-liberation movement in thought, to unlock the shackles on their spirits. For these comrades, the slogan should be to eliminate the remnants of Jia Gui's character and promote the spirit of Huiming!

    惠明和贾桂
    葛德
    在生产跃进高潮中，人们把自己的干劲，比作古时的武松、赵云、黄忠、罗成和穆桂英，认为上述这些人的形象，能够显示劳动人民的英雄本色，这比喻是有声有色的。但此外我又想到了“西厢记”里的惠明和尚。
    孙飞虎率五千兵马围困了普救寺，立逼寺内献出莺莺。张生虽然想出了缓兵之计，也作了请白马将军前来擒贼解围的计划，但要实现这个计划，就要有人去突围下书。这个当儿，事情成败的全部关键，都只在一个下书人的身上。但谁敢去呢？谁有只身杀出五千兵马的重围的胆量和本领呢？在一声高喊之下，惠明和尚挺身而出了。
    惠明和尚，在普救寺里来说，并非什么有重要地位的头面人物，只不过是一个烧火和尚。但他把一员贼将五千贼兵全不看在眼里，只是请众和尚“助威风擂几声鼓，仗佛力呐一声喊”，他便提一根“乌龙尾钢椽”，徒步儿“杀出了虎窟龙潭”，终于请来了白马将军。
    这里不必说他这场功德大小，值得学习的倒是他的可贵精神，第一，他见义勇为，不计个人得失。在他看来，锄暴安良是一种义举。他就毅然把这样一件大事，全部担在了自己身上。他不像别的人那样装傻弄呆，而是“有勇无惭”。他也不像张生那样，只是为了讨莺莺作老婆，才肯出主意写书请救兵。他其实也并不像那老和尚说的那样，只是被激出去的。他对张生的那两句唱词：“我从来斩钉截铁常居一，不似恁惹草拈花没掂三。”明明是说他自己从来就见义勇为，并不像张生那样为了“惹草拈花”才办事的。
    第二，他大勇无双敢于蔑视敌人。老和尚问他敢不敢去下书？他说：你们都说孙飞虎的名声播于天下，依我看他只是个淫欲、贪婪而又不中用的家伙。他对那五千人是这样看的，“绣旗下遥见英雄俺（我），我教那半万贼兵諕破胆。”就说明他是怎样的蔑视敌人。
    第三，他不受清规戒律的限制，没有奴隶性。他并没有因为自己地位微卑，便失去担当这一重任的勇气。一遇事便“杀人心逗起英雄胆”，足以说明他敢做敢为。他当面嘲笑张生不要只为了亲事许愿，足见他自觉身分比那些念书人、相国夫人、小姐等并不低。他甚至还蔑视他们。
    这种见义勇为、大勇无畏、敢说敢作，实在是中国劳动人民的宝贵品质，是一种高尚的风格，丝毫没有奴隶精神的痕迹。很值得学习，并加以发扬光大的。
    说到奴隶性格，就不能不想起“法门寺”里的贾桂，这人是大太监刘瑾的干儿子。在旧社会，沦为奴隶地位并不可耻，可耻而又可怕的是甘于奴隶地位，而又故意作出一副奴隶相来。贾桂就是这样一个惹观众笑骂的人物，在戏里他很活跃，但统计一下他的台词，说得最多的是“咋”！他只是在传达刘瑾的话时才说话，除此以外便只有顺着刘瑾说“咋”的份儿。这个人不只是不敢思想，而且是除了刘瑾的思想以外，再没有了“思想”，而且以此为荣，十分的安于这种现状。这是一个十足奴性的典型。
    现在，在我们国家里，自觉自己是奴隶而又安于奴隶地位的人是没有了，但不敢思想和不会思想、而又安于这种状态，自以为得计的人，怕也还没有绝迹。对这种人来说，应该来一个思想上的自我解放运动，以打开自己精神上的枷锁。对于这些同志，口号应该是肃清贾桂性格的残余，提倡惠明精神！
