Why?

    Feeling Stuffy After Staying in a Crowded Indoor Space for a Long Time
    Some people believe that this is because the air breathed out by many people contains a lot of carbon dioxide. In fact, this is not the case. The carbon dioxide in the air needs to account for at least about 4% of the air to make people feel uncomfortable. However, under normal circumstances, the carbon dioxide content in the air is only about 0.02%. Obviously, it is very difficult to increase it to 4%.
    The main reason is that the human respiratory tract and skin discharge a large amount of water vapor, making the water vapor content in the air close to saturation. In this way, the human body's heat is not easily dissipated, so it feels very "stuffy." Furthermore, the human respiratory tract and skin also discharge some metabolic waste products with special irritating odors, which in turn stimulate people, causing headaches, dizziness, and nausea.
    Therefore, it is very important to maintain air circulation at all times, no matter the occasion. (Dong)

专栏：为什么？

    在人多的室内停留较久会感到气闷
    有人认为这是由于人多，呼吸出来的气体含有很多的二氧化碳（碳酸气）的缘故。其实不是这样。空气中的二氧化碳要使人感到不舒服，起码要占到空气的4％左右才可能。可是在一般的情况下，空气中的二氧化碳的含量只有0.02％左右。显然，要增加到4％是很困难的。
    原来主要的原因是由于人的呼吸道和皮肤排出大量水蒸气，使空气中水蒸气的含量达到近于饱和状态。这样，人的热量不容易发散，因此感到很“闷”。再则人的呼吸道和皮肤还会排出一些具有特殊刺激臭的新陈代谢废物，反过来刺激人，使人感到头痛、眩晕、恶心。
    所以说，不论什么场合，经常保持空气流通是很重要的。（东）
