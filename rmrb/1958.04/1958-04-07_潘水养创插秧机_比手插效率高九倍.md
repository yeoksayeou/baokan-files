Xinhua News Agency, Nanning News: A rice transplanter recently exhibited at the PingLe Agricultural Exhibition has attracted a large audience. This rice transplanter, pulled by an ox and operated by one person guiding the ox and another adding seedlings, can transplant twelve mu of rice paddies in eight hours a day. Its efficiency is ten times that of manual transplanting. Representatives from Liang'an Township in Fuzhong County immediately requested to order ten machines.

The rice transplanter was created by Pan Shuiyang, a member of the Pingle Hong Kong Wooden Sailboat Transportation Cooperative, after a long period of arduous research and with the help of the Pingle Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Agriculture and the Agricultural Extension Station. It consists of a wooden frame assembled with twenty-seven main components, including a seedling box, seedling dividing box, seedling dividing crank, seedling patting board, transplanting hand, and depth adjuster. When working, the impeller installed on the right side of the machine body, inserted into the mud and water, is driven by the resistance of the mud and water, driving the six small gears on the machine through the chain, and the machine rhythmically performs seedling delivery, seedling dividing, and transplanting, transplanting three rows at a time, with row and plant spacing of (7 x 6). It not only transplants quickly, but also transplants firmly, straight, and neatly. According to Pan Shuiyang, this rice transplanter is currently equipped with three seedling boxes, but three more seedling boxes can be added, so that six rows can be transplanted each time, and the efficiency will be doubled.

    潘水养创插秧机
    比手插效率高九倍
    新华社南宁讯  最近在平乐农业展览会上展出的一架插秧机，吸引了广大观众。这种插秧机用一头牛牵引，一人赶牛，一人添秧，每天八小时可以插秧十二亩，它的效率等于用手插秧的十倍。富钟县两安乡的代表当场就要求订购十架。
    插秧机是平乐港木帆船运输合作社社员潘水养经过长期的艰苦钻研，并在平乐专署农业科、农业推广站的帮助下，创造出来的。它由木制机架装配上秧箱、分秧盒、分秧绞手、拍秧板、插秧手、深浅调节器等二十七个主要部件组成的。工作时，安置在机身右边插入泥水中的叶轮受泥水阻力推动，通过练条带动机上的六部小齿轮，机器便有节奏地进行送秧、分秧、插秧，一次插秧三行，行株距离是（七×六）。它不仅插秧快，而且插得稳、插得直、插得整齐。据潘水养说，这架插秧机上现在装设三部秧箱，还可以增设三个秧箱，这样每次就可插秧六行，效率将提高一倍。
