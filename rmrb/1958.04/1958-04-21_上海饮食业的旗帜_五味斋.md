Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th -- The Wu Wei Zhai Restaurant has become a banner for Shanghai's catering industry, attracting an increasing number of customers. In the past month and a half, the restaurant has received 1,103 written compliments from customers, and all ten service staff members have been praised.

When people come to Wu Wei Zhai, as soon as they are seated, the staff immediately serves a cup of hot tea and a face towel. Before the customer even orders, they proactively introduce various seasonal dishes. Before serving the dishes, they also bring newspapers and magazines to the customers. The service staff are adept at understanding the different preferences of customers. For customers with a Northern accent, they introduce more dishes with sour and spicy flavors. For customers from Suzhou and Wuxi, they recommend dishes with a sweet taste. For customers from Zhejiang, they introduce seafood such as clams and razor clams. Some customers do not like to order their own dishes, and if they just give a rough amount of money, the staff will help design the dishes. Female customers generally have smaller appetites, so the staff will arrange medium or small portions for them. The quality of the dishes is the same, but the price is much cheaper. Customers who are in a hurry do not have to worry about being delayed by eating. The staff will introduce various types of covered rice dishes, where vegetables are placed on top of the rice, and can be cooked and served in three or four minutes.

In the suggestion book, there are many examples of the service staff caring for customers. One mother brought her baby to eat, and the baby fell asleep midway. The staff gave up their own room to help take care of the baby and let her sleep well, so she could eat with peace of mind. The staff saw that some customers who were drinking were about to get drunk, and proactively went over to politely advise them to take care of their health, so as not to affect production and work. Recently, a staff member found four theater tickets in the restaurant. After waiting for a week without the owner coming to claim them, on the expiration date, the staff member braved the rain to rush to the theater and give them to the customer who was worrying about it before the play started.

Customers praised the delicious and palatable dishes at Wu Wei Zhai. Every morning, the restaurant's chefs and purchasers go to the market together to buy vegetables, so the selection of materials meets the standards. For example, the pig's trotters must be selected from the hind legs, which are tender and have small bones. The grass carp must be the black carp produced in Suzhou, which has thick and fresh meat. Raw materials are purchased as planned as much as possible to avoid accumulation and deterioration. Sometimes, if a certain dish is sold out but the customer specifically wants to eat it, they will borrow raw materials from neighboring businesses to cook it. If customers are having a dinner party at home, as long as they make a phone call, the chefs will bring their cooking utensils to the door to cook.

The staff of Wu Wei Zhai attach great importance to food and environmental hygiene. There is a large steamer in the kitchen, and every piece of tableware used by customers is boiled and disinfected. Raw and cooked dishes are placed separately. The three canteens are cleaned three times a day.

The advanced deeds of this restaurant are currently being exhibited at a city-wide exhibition of various industries competing for advanced status and striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    上海饮食业的旗帜——五味斋
    新华社上海19日电　五味斋饮食店已经成为上海饮食业的一面旗帜，慕名前往的顾客日益增多。最近一个半月中，这个店收到了一千一百零三条顾客的书面表扬意见，十个服务员人人受到了表扬。
    人们来到五味斋，才一坐定，服务员马上递上一杯热茶，一把面巾，没等顾客点菜，他们就主动介绍各种时鲜菜。上菜之前，还给顾客送来报纸杂志。服务员善于揣摩顾客的不同爱好。对北方口音的顾客，他们就多介绍一些带酸带辣的菜；对苏州、无锡的顾客，就推荐滋味甜的菜；对浙江顾客又介绍梅蛤、蛏子等海鲜。有些顾客不欢喜自己点菜，只要告诉一个约略的钱数，服务员就会帮助设计配菜。女顾客一般胃口小，服务员便给她们配中盆或小盆，菜的质量一样，而价格要便宜得多。有急事的顾客也不必担心因为吃饭而耽误时间，服务员会介绍各种花色的盖交饭，饭上盖菜，三四分钟就能烧好送来。
    在意见簿上，可以看到不少服务员关心顾客的事例。有一个妈妈带着婴孩来吃饭，孩子中途睡着了，服务员让出自己的房间，帮助照顾孩子睡好，让她安心地吃饭。服务员看到有些饮酒的顾客快要醉了，主动走过去婉言劝他保重身体，免得影响生产和工作。最近，一个服务员在店里拾到四张戏票，等了一星期没见失主来领，到期那天，服务员冒雨赶到戏院，在开戏以前送给那个正在发愁的顾客。
    顾客们称道五味斋的菜点鲜美可口。每天早晨，这个店的厨师同采购员一起上菜场买菜，因此选料符合规格。例如猪蹄要挑后蹄，肉嫩骨头小；青鱼要买苏州产的乌青，肉质厚而鲜肥。进料尽量做到有计划，避免积压变质。有时某种菜卖完而顾客指定要吃，他们便向邻近的同业借原料来烹调。如果顾客在家聚餐，只要打个电话去，厨师们便带着烹饪用具上门烧菜。
    五味斋的职工很重视食品和环境卫生。厨房里有个大蒸笼，顾客使用的每一件食具都经过煮沸消毒。生菜、熟菜一律分开放置。三个食堂每天都要打扫三次。
    这家饮食店的先进事迹目前正在一个全市性的各行各业比先进、比多快好省的展览会上展出。
