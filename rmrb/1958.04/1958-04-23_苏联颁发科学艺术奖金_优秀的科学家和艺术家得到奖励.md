Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 21st (TASS): The Soviet Lenin Prize Committee for Science and Technology has announced the winners of the 1958 prizes.

The recipients include prominent Soviet atomic physicist Lev Artsimovich, theoretical physicist Nikolai Bogolyubov, geophysicist Mikhail Budyko, geologist Nikolai Shatsky, metallurgist Ivan Bardin, and others.

Academician Artsimovich and Academician Leontovich, along with personnel from the Atomic Energy Institute, received the prize for their research on achieving unprecedented high temperatures through powerful pulsed discharges in gases. This opened the path to achieving controlled thermonuclear reactions.

Academician Bogolyubov solved the problem of establishing a microscopic theory of superfluidity and explained the strange phenomenon of superconductivity.

Professor Budyko, a geophysicist, founded a new branch of climate science: thermal balance climatology. His work demonstrated for the first time that the earth's surface itself warms the atmosphere, rather than receiving heat from the atmosphere as previously thought. His conclusions are helpful in solving various theoretical and practical problems such as weather forecasting and soil improvement measures.

The tectonic map of the USSR and neighboring countries at a scale of 1:5,000,000, compiled under the leadership of Academician Shatsky, received high praise at the International Geological Congress in Mexico, and Shatsky was elected as the head of the compilation of the world tectonic map.

Many scientists and engineers, headed by Academician Bardin, received prizes for creating the first industrial installations for continuous casting of steel.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 21st (TASS): The Lenin Prize Committee for Literature and Art has announced the winners of the 1958 prizes.

The winners include: Leningrad sculptor Anikushin, creator of the Pushkin monument; director Tovstonogov; actor Torubeyev; dancer Chabukiani; and musician Shostakovich.

    苏联颁发科学艺术奖金
    优秀的科学家和艺术家得到奖励
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：苏联列宁科学技术奖金委员会颁发了1958年的奖金。
    苏联著名原子物理学家阿尔齐莫维奇、列昂托维奇、理论物理学家博戈留博夫、地球物理学家布迪科、地质学家夏茨基、冶金学家巴尔金等都获得了奖金。
    阿尔齐莫维奇院士和列昂托维奇院士同原子能研究所人员一道获得了奖金。他们研究了在气体中实行强力脉冲放电以获得空前高温的问题。这为实现可控制的热核反应打开了道路。
    博戈留博夫院士解决了建立超流动性微观理论的问题并且解释了奇怪的超导电现象。
    地球物理学家布迪科教授创立了气候科学的新部门——热平衡气候学。他的著作第一次证明，地表本身在使大气层变热，而不是像以前所认为的从大气中获得热。他的结论有助于解决天气预报、土壤改良措施等各种理论和实际问题。
    夏茨基院士领导下绘制的比例尺为五百万分之一的苏联及邻近国家地壳构造图，得到国际地质大会墨西哥会议很高评价，夏茨基并被选为编制世界地壳构造图的负责人。
    以巴尔金院士为首的许多科学家和工程师由于创制了钢连续浇铸的第一批工业装置而获得奖金。
    据新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科21日讯：列宁文学艺术奖金委员会颁发了1958年的奖金。
    获奖者有：普希金纪念像的创作者、列宁格勒雕刻家安尼库辛、导演托夫斯顿诺柯夫、演员托鲁别耶夫、舞蹈家恰布基安尼、音乐家萧斯塔科维奇等。
