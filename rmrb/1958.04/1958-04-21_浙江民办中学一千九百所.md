Xinhua News Agency Report: As of April 8th, Zhejiang Province had established 1,935 private agricultural middle schools.

In the process of establishing agricultural middle schools, all localities have generally implemented the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The school buildings for private agricultural middle schools are utilizing vacant houses in the countryside. Desks, chairs, and other equipment are either borrowed or brought by the masses themselves. Many cadres who have been transferred to lower levels, technicians from agricultural technology extension stations, local Party branch secretaries, and high school graduates participating in labor in agricultural cooperatives have served as teachers.

The forms of schooling in various localities are diverse, including half-day study and half-day labor, and daytime labor and evening study. Graduation generally takes two to three years.

    浙江民办中学一千九百所
    据新华社讯　浙江省民办中学，截至4月8日为止，已经办了一千九百三十五所民办农业中学。
    各地在创办农业中学过程中，大都贯彻了多快好省的方针。民办农业中学的校舍是利用农村的空闲房子。课桌、椅子等用具，都是借用或由群众自己带来的。许多下放干部、农业技术推广站技术员、当地党支部书记和在农业社参加劳动的高中毕业生等都担任了教师。
    各地办学的形式多种多样，有半天学习半天劳动，有白天劳动晚上学习。一般是两到三年毕业。
