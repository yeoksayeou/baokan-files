	Next year, we'll still complain about too few trains
	One plot of land yields harvests like two,
	The advanced cooperative is full of benefits,
	Barren hills become hills of gold and silver,
	Pigs and cattle fill the pens, ducks fill the river.
	The year before last, we carried grain in baskets,
	Last year, we shipped grain by boat,
	This year, trucks can't load it all,
	Next year, we'll still complain about too few trains.
  (Jiangxi "Jinggangshan Daily")

	The dam is built high on the mountain,
	Every dry field becomes a pond,
	Girls have mirrors for dressing up,
	They can cleverly comb their hair even in the fields.
	The twenty-li dam becomes a river,
	Two thousand mu of rice is hauled by truck,
	From dawn till the sun sets,
	Like pulling a hair from an ox's hide.
      (Hubei "Cuckoo")

	The front mountain connects to the back mountain slope,
	The upper ridge of rice connects to the lower ridge of rice,
	Like a green felt carpet,
	Sewn tightly and hard to tear.
  (Hunan "Mass Art")

	Good seeds produce good seedlings,
	Good flowers bear good peaches,
	Plant good seedlings to grow strong,
	Good seedlings are half the harvest.

### 明年火车还嫌少

    明年火车还嫌少一丘田割两丘禾，高级社里好处多，荒山变成金银丘，猪牛满圈鸭满河。前年卖粮用箩挑，去年卖粮用船摇，今年汽车装不了，明年火车还嫌少。
  （江西“井岗山报”）大堰修在高山上，丘丘旱地变水塘，姑娘打扮有镜子，田里也能巧梳妆。二十里大堰变成河，二千亩谷子汽车拖，从早拖到太阳落，像牛身上拔根毛。
      （湖北“布谷鸟”）前山连着后山坡，上垅禾连下垅禾，好像一铺绿毡毯，缝的牢牢难撕破。
  （湖南“群众艺术”）好种出好苗，好花结好桃，种好秧儿壮，苗好一半粮。（山西运城，陈航搜集）
