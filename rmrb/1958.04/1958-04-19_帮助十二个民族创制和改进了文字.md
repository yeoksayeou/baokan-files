Helped Twelve Ethnic Groups Create and Improve Writing Systems

China is a multi-ethnic country. In addition to the Han nationality, there are fifty ethnic minorities, with a population of approximately thirty-five million. In the past, due to the oppression of the reactionary ruling class, ethnic minorities faced various restrictions and discrimination in using and developing their own languages and writing systems. Before the national liberation, except for the Hui and Manchu nationalities, with a population of about six million, who commonly used Chinese characters, only seventeen ethnic minorities, including the Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongolian, Kazakh, Korean, Xibe, Dai, Uzbek, Tatar, Russian, Yi, Naxi, Miao, Jingpo, Lisu, Lahu, and Va, with a population of about sixteen million, had their own writing systems. The writing systems of the latter seven ethnic groups were not even commonly used. The remaining thirty-plus ethnic minorities, with a population of about thirteen million, had never had their own writing systems.

However, the writing systems of the seventeen ethnic minorities that originally had their own writing were also relatively complex, totaling thirty-two types of writing systems. For example, the Dai ethnic group had five types of writing, the Naxi ethnic group had four types of writing, and the Jingpo, Lisu, and Yi ethnic groups each had three types of writing. This greatly hindered cultural exchange between the ethnic groups.

After liberation, the Party and the People's Government regarded helping ethnic minorities develop their languages and writing systems as an important task in addressing ethnic issues during the transition period. The Party and the government have repeatedly issued instructions on helping ethnic minorities without writing systems to create writing systems and helping ethnic minorities with incomplete writing systems to reform their writing systems, and have taken concrete measures. As early as 1950, the Party and the government sent language science workers to the ethnic minority areas with the Southwest, Northwest, and Central South sub-delegations of the Central Delegation to investigate and study the ethnic languages in these areas. In 1956, relevant departments, based on existing work, organized seven ethnic minority language investigation teams, composed of more than twenty ethnic groups and more than seven hundred people, to carry out investigation work in ethnic minority areas across the country.

Currently, the investigation teams have completed a general survey of the languages of thirty-three ethnic minorities. Based on these investigation materials, and after repeated discussions and studies with representatives of the relevant ethnic groups, ethnic minority language research institutions have helped four ethnic groups that originally had no writing system, including the Zhuang, Buyi, Hani, and Li, and seven ethnic groups whose writing systems were not commonly used in the past, including the Miao, Yi, Naxi, Lisu, Jingpo, Lahu, and Va, to design sixteen writing schemes in the form of Latin letters. They have also helped the Dai ethnic group, whose writing system was not unified, to improve its original writing system and designed two writing schemes in the form of Dai letters. Of the above eighteen writing systems, except for the Zhuang writing system, which has been formally promoted with the approval of the State Council, the rest are being experimentally promoted or are preparing for experimental promotion. So far, except for ethnic minorities who commonly use Chinese, twenty-one ethnic groups across the country have ended the history of having no writing system or an incomplete writing system and now have their own ethnic writing systems.

    帮助十二个民族创制和改进了文字
    我国是个多民族的国家，除了汉族还有五十个少数民族，人口约三千五百多万。过去，由于反动统治阶级的压迫，少数民族在使用和发展本民族的语言文字上，受到种种的限制和歧视。全国解放前，除回、满等民族约六百多万人口通用汉文外，只有维吾尔、藏、蒙古、哈萨克、朝鲜、锡伯、傣、乌孜别克、塔塔尔、俄罗斯、彝、纳西、苗、景颇、傈僳、拉祜、佧佤等十七个约一千六百多万人口的少数民族有自己的文字，后列七个民族的文字还是不通用的。而其余的约一千三百多万人口的三十多个少数民族一直没有自己的文字。
    但是，原有本民族文字的十七个少数民族的文字也比较复杂，总计有三十二种文字。例如，傣族有五种文字，纳西族有四种文字，景颇、傈僳和彝族各有三种文字。这样，就大大妨碍了各民族的文化交流。
    解放后，党和人民政府把帮助少数民族发展语言文字的工作，作为过渡时期民族问题方面的一个重要任务。党和政府曾不止一次地作出关于帮助没有文字的少数民族创制文字和帮助文字不完备的民族改革文字的指示，并且采取了具体措施。早在1950年，党和政府就派出语言科学工作者随中央访问团西南、西北、中南各分团到少数民族地区，调查研究这些地区的民族语言，1956年，有关各部门在已有工作的基础上，组织了包括二十多种民族成分、七百多人的七个少数民族语言调查队，在全国各少数民族地区展开了调查工作。
    现在，各调查队共已完成对三十三个少数民族语言的普遍调查工作。少数民族语言研究机构根据这些调查材料，并经过同有关民族的代表反复讨论和研究，已经帮助僮、布依、哈尼、黎等四个原来没有文字的民族和苗、彝、纳西、傈僳、景颇、拉祜、佧佤等七个过去文字不通用的民族，设计了十六种拉丁字母形式的文字方案，还帮助文字不统一的傣族改进了原有文字，设计了两种傣文字母形式的文字方案。以上十八种文字除僮文已经国务院批准正式推行外，其余的正在实验推行或准备实验推行。到目前为止，除通用汉文的少数民族外，全国已有二十一个民族，结束了没有文字或文字不完备的历史，有了本民族的文字。
