Xinhua News Agency, 10th - Havana News: An armed uprising against the Batista dictatorship took place in Havana, the capital of Cuba, on the 9th.

The armed insurgents briefly seized Cuba's largest radio and television station, and through broadcasts called on Cuban residents to "overthrow the tyrant Batista's government" and called on workers to hold a general strike. Soon after, workers at the Havana Telephone Company and other public utilities left their jobs. Traffic in Havana and telephone connections with the outside world were interrupted.

It is reported that the armed uprising took place at 11:30 a.m. on the 9th in the area centered on the Old Havana harbor district. Batista dispatched a large number of fully armed troops and police to suppress the armed insurgents. After fierce fighting, the insurgents withdrew from various strongholds. The Cuban government announced in the afternoon that "order has been restored" in Havana, but sporadic gunfire could still be heard in downtown Havana for several hours afterward.

At the same time, it is reported that in Santiago, Oriente Province, some armed insurgents attacked a huge local prison in the suburbs of the city at dawn on the 9th. According to an official communique issued on the 8th, in Nicaro in Oriente Province and Quemado de Güines in Las Villas Province in central Cuba (near the north coast), insurgent forces launched two fierce attacks on the garrison. In Las Villas Province, this is the first time the government has announced that there is war.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th - New York News: Mario Llerena, a representative of the Cuban People's Uprising Forces, issued a statement in New York on the 9th, exposing the Cuban dictator Batista's plot to hire foreign pilots to bomb the bases of the Cuban People's Uprising Forces.

Mario Llerena said: "Batista is looking for foreign mercenary pilots to carry out large-scale bombing of the Sierra Maestra mountains (Editor's note: the location of the base of the People's Uprising Forces in Oriente Province, eastern Cuba) and (near) Santiago (the capital of Oriente Province). For this purpose, he obtained highly destructive incendiary bombs from the Dominican Republic. Five Cuban Air Force pilots have been arrested for refusing to carry out this plan."

Mario Llerena also pointed out that Batista has ordered all foreign journalists to leave Oriente Province immediately because he is afraid that they will become witnesses to the bombing.

    反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权
    古巴首都发生武装暴动
    奥连特等省起义人民猛攻政府军
    新华社10日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴首都哈瓦那9日发生了一次反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的武装暴动。
    武装起义者一度夺取了古巴最大的广播和电视台，并且通过广播号召古巴居民“推翻暴君巴蒂斯塔的政府”和号召工人举行总罢工。不久以后，哈瓦那电话公司和其他公用事业单位的工人们离开了工作。哈瓦那市的交通以及同外界的电话联系都告中断。
    据报道，武装暴动是在9日上午十一时三十分在以老哈瓦那海港区为中心的地区发生的。巴蒂斯塔出动了大批全副武装的军队和警察镇压武装起义者。在经过激战后，起义者从各个据点撤出。古巴政府下午宣布哈瓦那“秩序恢复”，但是此后好几个小时在哈瓦那市区还可以听到零星的枪声。
    同时，据报道，在奥连特省的圣地亚哥，一些武装起义人民在9日黎明，攻打了城郊的一个巨大的地方监狱。另据官方8日公报宣布，在奥连特省的尼凯罗和古巴中部拉斯维利亚斯省的凯马多德吉内斯（靠近北海岸），起义部队对驻军发动了两次猛攻。在拉斯维利亚斯省，这还是政府第一次宣布有战争。
    新华社10日讯　纽约消息：古巴人民起义部队的代表马里奥·列雷纳9日在纽约发表声明，揭露古巴独裁者巴蒂斯塔打算雇佣外国飞行员来轰炸古巴人民起义部队的根据地的阴谋。
    马里奥·列雷纳说：“巴蒂斯塔正在物色外国雇佣飞行员来对马埃斯特腊山区（编者注：古巴东部奥连特省人民起义部队的根据地所在地）和（奥连特省省会）圣地亚哥（附近）进行大规模的轰炸。为了这一目的，他从多米尼加共和国取得了具有巨大破坏力的燃烧弹。五个古巴空军飞行员因为拒绝执行这一计划已经被逮捕了。”
    马里奥·列雷纳还指出，巴蒂斯塔已经命令所有外国新闻记者一律离开奥连特省，因为他害怕他们成为这次轰炸的见证人。
