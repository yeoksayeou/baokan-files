    On the Expansion of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute Also Did Their Best
    ——An Opinion on a Report
    We were very excited to see the news about the expansion of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant published in the People's Daily on April 7.
    The "Shigang" expansion project saved 50 million yuan, reducing the infrastructure investment per ton of steel from 1,000 yuan during the first Five-Year Plan to below 200 yuan. This victory was achieved under the leadership of the Central Government and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, with the joint efforts of Shigang, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute, and various other parties. However, Comrade Zhao Shenying's report only emphasized how the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant made every effort to carefully calculate and save, while neglecting the efforts of other parties, especially the efforts of the black metallurgical designers responsible for the "Shigang" expansion design.
    According to our understanding, in the "Shigang" expansion design work, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute, in order to realize the Party Central Committee's construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, displayed a high degree of enthusiasm, worked diligently day and night, and carefully studied how to build a large-scale iron and steel plant with the investment of the original design. Now this plan has been realized, but the report does not mention the efforts and achievements of the design institute at all, which is not appropriate and will affect the enthusiasm of the design staff. Therefore, we suggest that the reporter comrades go to the Black Metallurgy Design Institute again for an interview to see what contributions they have made to the "Shigang" expansion project.

    石景山钢铁厂扩建，黑色冶金设计院也尽了力
    ——对一篇报道的意见
    我们看到了4月7日人民日报发表的关于石景山钢铁厂扩建的消息，感到非常兴奋。
    “石钢”扩建工程节约五千万元，使每吨钢的基建投资从第一个五年计划的一千元降到二百元以下，取得这个胜利是在中央和冶金工业部领导下，在石钢和黑色冶金设计院以及各方面共同努力所取得的。但赵慎应同志的报道中，只强调了石景山钢铁厂如何千方百计精打细算，而忽略了其他方面的努力，尤其是担负“石钢”扩建设计的黑色冶金设计人员的努力。
    据我们了解，黑色冶金设计院在“石钢”扩建设计工作中，为了实现党中央关于多、快、好、省的建设方针，发挥了高度的干劲，夜以继日的辛勤劳动，认真研究如何能用原有设计的投资来建设一个大型钢铁厂。现在这个方案实现了，但在报道中对设计院的努力和成绩却只字不提，这是不够恰当的，对设计人员的积极性是会有影响的。因此，我们建议记者同志再去黑色冶金设计总院采访一次，看看他们在“石钢”扩建工程中做了那些贡献。
