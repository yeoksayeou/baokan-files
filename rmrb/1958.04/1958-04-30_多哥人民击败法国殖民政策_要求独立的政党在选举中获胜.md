Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 29th. French colonial policy suffered another serious setback in Togo on the 27th. On this day, France held legislative assembly elections in this trust territory in Southwest Africa. The results of the election showed that the nationalist party advocating complete independence for Togo – the Togolese Unity Committee, and its supporters – defeated the ruling party, the "Togolese Progress Party," which supported French colonial policy, and won nearly two-thirds of the seats in the Legislative Assembly.

The election, held under the supervision of the United Nations, was an election that determined the future of Togo. This is because, according to a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, the Legislative Assembly produced in this election would make a decision on the abolition of the trusteeship system and whether Togo would be independent or merged into the French Community.

According to the election results announced yesterday, the Togolese Unity Committee won 28 of the 46 seats in the Legislative Assembly, and non-partisan individuals supporting it won two seats. The Togolese Unity Committee boycotted the so-called referendum manufactured by France in October 1956, because this vote was only a means for France to continue its rule. It stipulated that Togo would implement "internal autonomy" within the French Community, but in reality, power remained in the hands of the French High Commissioner.

The "Togolese Progress Party," which supported the above-mentioned French policy, suffered a major defeat in the election on the 27th: it only won five seats, and its supporters only won ten seats. The remaining seat was occupied by a non-partisan individual.

After the announcement of the election results in Togo, senior officials of the French Ministry of Overseas Territories immediately held an emergency meeting to study countermeasures. Observers in Paris pointed out that the results of the Togolese Legislative Assembly election caused shock and frustration among the French ruling group, which had originally hoped to consolidate its colonial rule in Togo through this election. It is especially afraid that the situation in Togo will cause a chain reaction in other French colonies in Africa.

    多哥人民击败法国殖民政策
    要求独立的政党在选举中获胜
    新华社29日讯　巴黎消息：法国的殖民政策27日又在多哥遭到严重的挫败。这一天，法国在西南非洲的这个托管地举行了立法议会选举。选举结果，要求多哥完全独立的民族主义政党——多哥统一委员会及其支持者击败了支持法国殖民政策的执政党——“多哥进步党”，而获得了立法议会中将近三分之二的席位。
    在联合国监督下举行的这次选举，是决定多哥前途的一次选举。因为，根据联合国大会的决议，这次选举中产生的立法议会，将就废除托管制度以及多哥是独立还是并入法兰西联邦的问题，作出决定。
    根据昨天宣布的选举结果，多哥统一委员会获得了立法议会四十六个席位中的二十八席，支持它的无党派人士获得两席。多哥统一委员会在1956年10月曾经抵制了法国制造的所谓公民投票，因为这次投票只是使得法国能够继续实行统治的一种手段。它规定多哥在法兰西联邦内实行“内部自治”，而实际上权力仍然操在法国高级专员的手里。
    支持法国上述政策的“多哥进步党”在27日的选举中大大失败：它只获得了五席，而它的支持者也只获得了十席。余下一个议席由无党派人士占有。
    在多哥选举结果宣布后，法国海外属地部的高级官员马上举行了紧急会议来研究对策。巴黎的观察家指出，多哥立法议会选举的结果在法国统治集团中引起了震惊和沮丧，法国统治集团原来是希望通过这次选举来巩固它在多哥的殖民统治的。它尤其害怕多哥的情况在非洲的法国其他殖民地会引起连锁反应。
