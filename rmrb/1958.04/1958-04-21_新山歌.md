New Folk Song

	North of Xun County, the desolate sands are shaded by trees,
	Every commune has apple orchards, you see.
	South of the county, the Yellow River irrigates the land,
	Long-parched earth has turned into fertile sand.
	East of the county, teams of pigs fill the pens,
	Chickens quack and ducks squawk all running like hens.
	West of the county, electrification is coming fast,
	Water-powered mills are whirring, their work is meant to last.
	From all directions, songs arise,
	Heroes build the golden Xun County towards the skies!
		(From the Xun County, Henan newspaper)

    新山歌县北荒沙树遮天，社社都有苹果园。县南黄水灌溉地，久旱之地变良田。县东队队猪满圈，鸡鸣鸭叫跑成片。县西马上电气化，水打磨儿呼呼转。四面八方歌声起，群英建设金?县。
      （河南?县报）
