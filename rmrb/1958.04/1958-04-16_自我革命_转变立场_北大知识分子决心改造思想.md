Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Peking University intellectuals, in the Two-Anti movement, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the masses, are transforming their positions and reforming their thinking through opening their hearts to the Party and consciously making revolution.

Following the ten-thousand-person mobilization rally on April 2nd, the Peking University Two-Anti movement began holding "heart-to-heart talks" separately to conduct criticism and self-criticism. These "heart-to-heart talks" adopted a format of free combination in groups of three or two, progressing from small to large and from shallow to deep, making it easier to carry out criticism. At these meetings, many professors opened their hearts to the Party and consciously made revolution.

Professor Li Ruqi, director of the Vertebrate Research Office of the Biology Department, after years of doubt and watching, saw clearly the law that "the situation is pressing, reform is imperative, otherwise the future is bleak and one will fall behind." At the same time, he "believed in the Party, believed in the masses." From then on, this geneticist, who never liked attending meetings and expressed aversion to political movements, experienced a tremendous leap in his thinking. He criticized others and criticized himself. A Party member criticized him at a heart-to-heart talk: "When right-wing elements rampantly attacked last year, right-wing elements spread rumors in big-character posters saying that the Communist Party had burned all of Professor Li Ruqi's works on Morgan's theories. We asked you to verify this, and you also said that this was not the case. But, Professor Li, justice was so precious at that time, why didn't you come out and say a fair word?" Professor Li Ruqi immediately said: "Your criticism is correct! I need to examine this matter." In his self-criticism, he did not just deal with the matter at hand, but excavated his own thoughts and revealed his conflicting emotions regarding Morgan's theories at the time. He said that his past outlook on life was gloomy, and his latent energy and infinite wisdom were offset by considerations of personal gain, which was really foolish. He believes that now is a golden opportunity, which must not be missed, and he must join everyone in criticizing everything that cannot be seen, so as not to fall behind the times.

In this movement, Professor Deng Guangming, director of the Ancient History Teaching and Research Section of the History Department, who used to call himself a "willing middle-of-the-roader" and only wanted to settle in the "middle reaches," now feels that "this road is not feasible" after the masses presented the facts and reasoned with him. He expressed his desire to quickly change his position and strive to move upstream. Several years ago, he also wanted to study Marxism-Leninism, but because his thinking was incompatible and he found it increasingly difficult, he gave up due to fear of difficulty and wanted to live in peace, wanting to cling to the old and return to his old business, "rummaging through the old boxes" and engaging in his own set of cultural heritage. From then on, he believed that he still had some capital to draw on and that he could do without taking the path of Marxism-Leninism. As a result, his teaching was still a pile of historical materials, and his idealistic philosophical viewpoints did not change much. In this movement, his students wrote big-character posters criticizing him, and he just shook his head and dismissed it. Graduate students, based on the materials provided in the big-character posters, sorted them out and summarized them into several questions for him to consider; he made some explanations. His colleagues further analyzed and summarized the above materials, pointing out that he was taking the bourgeois line in his academic work, and pointing out the harm of this line to students and the country. Students also said in big-character posters: "You are talking about the history of emperors and generals, not the history of the people," "You are talking about old goods." He was shocked, and with the help of the Party, he finally went from calculating the minor debts of his thinking to calculating the total debts of his thinking, believing that "it is not a matter of individual facts in the criticism, but a whole set of issues such as my outlook on life, political attitude, and academic thought." Now the matter is so clear, Marxism-Leninism is indispensable, but I don't have it!" When he faced up to his mistakes, the power to correct them was born. He examined his mistakes and expressed his desire to be a red and expert Marxist-Leninist historian. Now, the number of people who have expressed their determination to transform themselves after intense ideological struggle is gradually increasing. They all have this experience: ideological changes and leaps are often directly proportional to the depth of criticism and self-criticism; once they jump out of the small circle of bourgeois individualism, the world in front of them seems infinitely wide, and they feel that in the race towards socialism, they are both an athlete starting to run and the master of this stadium.

Now, the school Party committee is guiding the professors to start by analyzing and criticizing the specific problems exposed in the big-character posters, and then organizing debates. It is also preparing to shift to discussing and formulating individual red-and-expert plans after bourgeois ideology has been exposed and criticized.

### 自我革命　转变立场  北大知识分子决心改造思想

    自我革命　转变立场
    北大知识分子决心改造思想
    据新华社讯　北京大学知识分子在双反运动中，在党的领导和群众的帮助下，通过向党交心、自觉革命，正在转变立场，改造思想。
    继4月2日万人动员大会之后，北大双反运动即分别召开“谈心会”，开展批评和自我批评。这种“谈心会”采用三三两两自由结合的形式，由小到大，由浅入深，易于展开批评。在这些会上，不少教授向党交心，自觉革命。
    生物系脊椎动物研究室主任李汝祺教授经过多年的怀疑和观望，看清了“形势逼人，不改不行，否则前途茫茫，落在人后”的规律，同时“相信了党，相信了群众”，从此，这位从来不爱开会、对政治运动表示厌倦的遗传学家，思想上有了一个极大的跃进。他批评别人，批评自己。一位党员在谈心会上批评他：“去年右派分子猖狂进攻的时候，右派分子在大字报上造谣说，共产党把李汝祺先生写的摩尔根学说的著作都烧掉了，我们访问你查对此事，你也说没有这回事。但是，李先生，正义在当时是多么可贵，你为什么不出来说句公道话呢？”李汝祺教授立即说：“你批评得对！这事我要检查。”他在检查中不是就事论事，而是挖掘了自己的思想，揭发了自己当时在摩尔根学说问题上所存在的抵触情绪。他说他过去的人生观是灰溜溜的，潜在的精力和无限的智慧，都为考虑个人得失所抵销，实在愚蠢。他认为现在是千载一时的好时机，千万不能让他过去，要跟着大家一起批判掉一切见不得人的东西，然后才不致于落在时代的后面。
    在这次运动中，过去自称“甘心做中间派”只想安居于“中游”的历史系古代史教研室主任邓广铭教授，经过群众摆事实，讲道理，现在已觉得“此路不通”，表示要赶快改变立场，力争上游。他在几年前也一度想钻研马克思列宁主义，由于思想上格格不入，觉得越钻越难，钻不进去，就又因畏难而想苟安，想抱残守缺去重理他的旧业，“翻翻老箱底”，搞自己那一套文化遗产，从此他就认为自己还有老本可吃，不走马克思列宁主义的道路也行。结果是，他在教学上仍是史料堆砌，唯心主义的哲学观点并无多大改变。在这次运动中，他的学生纷纷写大字报批评他，他只摇摇头了事。研究生根据大字报上所提供的材料，加以整理，综合成几个问题请他考虑；他作了一些解释。他的同事们又把以上的材料进一步加以分析和归纳，指出他在学术上所走的是资产阶级路线，指出了这条路线对学生、对国家的危害性。学生们也在大字报上说：“你讲的是帝王将相的历史，不是人民大众的历史”，“你讲的是旧货”。他震动了，在党的帮助下，最后从算思想上的零账到算思想上的总账，认为“不是批评中的个别事实问题，而是我的人生观、政治态度和学术思想等一整套的问题”。现在事情这样明显，没有马列主义不行，但自己没有！”当他正视到自己的错处，改正错误的力量也就诞生了，他检查了自己的错误，表示要做又红又专的马克思列宁主义历史学家。现在经过激烈思想斗争表示决心改造自己的人，正在逐渐增加。他们都有这样的体会：思想上的变化和跃进，往往同批评和自我批评的深度成正比；一旦跳出了资产阶级个人主义的小圈子，展现在眼前的世界就似乎无比地宽广起来，觉得在奔向社会主义的赛跑中，自己既是一个开步走的运动员，又是这个运动场的主人。
    现在，学校党委会正引导教授们从分析批判大字报上所暴露出来的具体问题入手，然后再组织辩论。并准备在资产阶级思想受到揭发和批判以后，再转入讨论制定各人的红专规划。
