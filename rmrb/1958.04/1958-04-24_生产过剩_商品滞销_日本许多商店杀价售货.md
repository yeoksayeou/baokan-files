Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 22nd: Retail stores in the Kinki region, centered around Osaka, that distribute electrical appliances, cameras, cosmetics, and other goods, are already selling these commodities at 70% or 80% of the prices stipulated by manufacturers. According to Kyodo News, the reasons for this phenomenon are overproduction, stagnant sales, and a decline in general purchasing power.

Under the influence of the price reductions at retail stores, department stores in Osaka have also recently reduced the prices of electrical appliances and cameras. Kyodo News says that this trend will spread nationwide, which has caused great shock to manufacturers and retailers.

    生产过剩　商品滞销
    日本许多商店杀价售货
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：以大阪为中心的近畿地方的经销电气用具、照相机、化妆品等的零售店，已经按照制造商规定的价格打七折或八折出售这些商品。据共同社说，产生这种现象的原因是生产过剩、商品滞销、一般购买力开始降低等。
    在零售商店削价的影响下，大阪的百货公司近来也减价出售电气用具和照相机。共同社说，这种趋势将波及全国范围，这使制造商和零售商感到很大的震动。
