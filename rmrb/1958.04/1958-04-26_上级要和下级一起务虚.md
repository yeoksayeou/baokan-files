Higher Levels Should Engage in “Virtual” Discussions Together With Subordinates
Yi Huai

After reading the news about the coal ministry's four-level cadre conference, everyone will say that this conference was a good example of engaging in "virtual" discussions. One of the reasons why this conference was so successful in "virtual" discussions was that leaders and subordinates participated together.

It is extremely important that higher levels and lower levels engage in "virtual" discussions together. Everyone will remember that before the rectification campaign, the relationship between many business leadership organs and grassroots units was limited to discussing business and numerical targets without discussing anything else. Lower-level cadres had some mental distress and problems, and they wanted to discuss their opinions about the work or the higher-level organs with the leaders, but there were few such opportunities. Sometimes, lower-level cadres raised some opinions to the higher-level organs from a political perspective or from the perspective of the Party's policies, but these opinions often didn't reach the leaders; they were turned down by the relevant departments on the grounds that they didn't comply with certain rules and regulations. As for whether these opinions were reasonable, they didn't get a clear answer. The requirements of higher-level organs for lower-level cadres were also very simple: just complete the task, sometimes even regardless of the methods used to complete the task. According to some people, "It doesn't matter if it's a black cat or a white cat, as long as it can catch mice, it's a good cat." When higher-level leaders went to the grassroots, most of them still sat in their offices looking at charts and checking numbers, unwilling to get involved in political and ideological work, or even to talk to the Party Secretary to understand the various aspects of the grassroots work. Of course, the reason why lower levels did not engage in "virtual" discussions was mainly because their understanding was problematic, but this was closely related to the higher-level organs' focus on "real" matters and neglect of "virtual" ones.

"Virtual" comes from "real," and leadership organs must start from "real" to engage in "virtual" discussions. So where is the "real" for leadership organs? It should be said that a small part is in the leadership organs themselves, but most of it is in the grassroots units. The task of the leadership organs is to formulate specific policies and plans for the system and the region based on the Party's guidelines and policies, and to lead and supervise the subordinate units and regions to correctly implement these guidelines and policies. Whether the guidelines and plans themselves are correct and what problems exist in the implementation need to be examined in the grassroots activities. Therefore, leadership organs cannot be separated from the "real" of the grassroots when engaging in "virtual" discussions. For example, if the Ministry of Coal doesn't analyze the specific situations of each bureau and mine to criticize conservative thinking, it will be difficult to liberate the coal system from the long-term constraints of conservative thinking from top to bottom.

If the comrades in the grassroots units do not engage in "virtual" discussions, the "virtual" discussions of the leadership organs will not be successful. But now the comrades in the grassroots units still do not know how to engage in "virtual" discussions. There are many reasons why they do not know how to engage in "virtual" discussions, but the most important one is that they regard "virtual" and "real" as being opposed to each other. They believe that "virtual" and "real" are opposed, that those who engage in "real" matters cannot engage in "virtual" matters, and that those who engage in "virtual" matters cannot engage in "real" matters. Therefore, many factories and mines had such a division of labor: the factory director only took care of "real" matters—production and business—and the Party Secretary only took care of "virtual" matters—political ideology. As a result, political and ideological work was divorced from reality, and business work lost its command. In fact, "virtual" and "real" are a unity of opposites. Where there is "virtual," there is "real," and where there is "real," there is "virtual." There is "virtual" in "real," and there is "real" in "virtual." As mentioned earlier, "virtual" comes from "real," and at the same time, "virtual" can promote the development of "real." There are many reasons why all walks of life have been able to formulate leaping-forward plans this time, but one of the most important reasons is that after the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the political and ideological awareness of workers, peasants, and other working people has been greatly improved. The coal ministry's four-level cadre conference is also a good example. This conference not only shattered conservative thinking but also formulated realistic and feasible advanced leaping-forward targets. After explaining this dialectical relationship to the comrades in the grassroots units, and then dissecting a "sparrow" like the Ministry of Coal Industry, the eyes of the comrades below will quickly light up, and they will quickly learn to engage in "virtual" discussions, and the "virtual" discussions of the leadership organs will have a foundation.

    上级要和下级一起务虚
    易槐
    大家读了煤炭部四级干部会议的新闻，都会说这个会议务虚务得好。这个会议所以务虚务得好，原因之一是领导和下级一起来务虚。
    上级和下级一起来务虚，这是极为重要的一个经验。大家还会记得，整风运动以前，不少业务领导机关和基层单位的关系是只谈业务和指标数字而不谈其他。下级干部思想上有些苦闷和问题，对工作或者对上级机关有些意见，也想和上级领导同志谈谈，但是这样的机会不多；下级干部有时候从政治、从党的方针政策的角度，向上级机关提出了一些意见，也常常到不了领导同志那里，就被有关的科室用不合某些规章制度为理由顶了回去，至于这些意见本身是否合理，却得不到明确的答案。上级机关对下级干部的要求也简单得很：只要完成任务就好，有时候甚至不管用什么办法去完成任务。照有些人的说法就是：不管黑猫白猫，会捉老鼠就是好猫。上级领导同志到基层去，大多数还是坐在办公室里看图表查数字，不愿过问政治思想工作，甚至不愿和党委书记谈谈，了解基层工作各方面情况。当然，下级所以不务虚，主要是他们的认识有问题，但是和领导机关的这种只管实不问虚有极大的关系。
    虚从实来，领导机关要务虚也得从实出发。那么领导机关的实在那里呢？应该说少部分在领导机关本身，大部分则在基层单位。领导机关的任务是根据党的方针路线制定本系统和本地区的具体的方针政策和规划，领导和督促所属单位和地区正确地实现这些方针政策和规划。方针和规划本身是否正确，执行中有什么问题，都需要在基层活动中考查。因此，领导机关要务虚，就不能离开基层的实。例如煤炭部如果不从分析各局、矿的具体情况来批判保守思想，就很难使煤炭系统从上到下从保守思想的长期束缚中解放出来。
    基层单位的同志不务虚，领导机关的虚是务不好的。可是现在基层单位的同志还不会务虚。他们不会务虚的原因很多，但是其中最重要的一点，是把虚与实对立起来，他们认为虚与实是对立的，务实的人就不能务虚，务虚的人就不能务实。因此，许多厂矿中就曾有这样的分工：厂长只管实——生产业务，党委书记只管虚——政治思想，结果是政治思想工作脱离了实际，业务工作失掉了统帅。其实，虚与实是对立的统一，有虚就有实，有实就有虚，实中有虚，虚中有实。如前边所说的，虚是从实中来的，同时，虚又能推动实的发展。这次各行各业所以能够制订出跃进的规划，原因很多，但是其中最重要的一个原因是经过整风和反右派斗争以后，工人、农民和其他劳动人民的政治思想觉悟有了极大的提高。煤炭部四级干部会议也是个很好的例子，这个会议不但大破了保守思想，而且订出了切实可行的先进的跃进指标。对基层单位的同志讲清这个辩证关系以后，再像煤炭工业部一样找个“麻雀”来解剖一下，下边同志的眼睛就会很快亮起来，就会很快学会务虚，领导机关的务虚也就有了基础。
