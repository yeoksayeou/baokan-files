Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 23rd—The African Independent States Conference closed at 6 p.m. on the 22nd. In its final declaration, the conference affirmed its commitment to the United Nations Charter and the principles of the Bandung Conference, emphasized that the participating countries unite to safeguard their independence, support the struggle of people in non-independent regions of Africa for independence and autonomy, and called on the major powers to cease the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons.

The delegations of the eight independent African countries participating in the conference, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, the ambassadors of various countries to Ghana, and other guests attended the closing ceremony.

The heads of the delegations all spoke at the closing ceremony, expressing their happiness at the successful conclusion of the conference and gratitude to the host country, Ghana, and its Prime Minister. They also emphasized the unity of purpose and spirit of cooperation in the conference discussions.

Ghanaian Prime Minister Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, in announcing the closure of the conference, said that he was pleased that the conference had achieved its purpose, even more perfectly than the most optimistic participants had anticipated. All decisions were reached unanimously after a free exchange of views in an atmosphere of the utmost harmony, friendship and mutual understanding and cooperation.

Nkrumah said that the unity of purpose displayed by our African character will enable us to play an active role in the future and to issue a united call in defense of the cause of peace, in support of the liberation of non-independent parts of Africa, and in defense of our national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. He expressed the hope that the next conference would be attended by other independent African countries.

Dr. Fawzi, Foreign Minister of the United Arab Republic, said that this conference "marks and formally proclaims the birth of an Africanism with a world outlook. This Africanism is constructive, far-sighted, friendly, fully awakened, vibrant and energetic." He said that the shackles of slavery and tyranny have been shattered, forever shattered.

Libyan Foreign Minister Wahbi al-Buri said that the conference was successful because its greatest goal was "to ensure that freedom, justice and peace prevail on our continent and in the world." He expressed his belief that the resolutions adopted by the conference would be fully implemented with the same loyalty and determination with which they were drafted. He said that the conference has taken a major step towards consolidating world peace and security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

Sudanese Foreign Minister Mahjoub said that the conference participants were pioneers, "leading our African brothers and sisters—our brothers and sisters who are still under foreign rule—towards the path of achieving their independence." He condemned colonialism as the root of all evil and pledged to make every effort to end colonial rule.

Prince Sahle Selassie, head of the Ethiopian delegation, said that the conference symbolized the inherent victory of Africa's discovery, which until today had been done by others. He said: "Africans have begun to discover Africa, and we find that our continent is very rich in human and material resources."

The Ethiopian prince said that the conference was also important for future relations between Africa and the world. He also called on the colonial powers to consider very carefully the conference's proposals, appeals and resolutions. He also welcomed representatives to the next African Independent States Conference in Addis Ababa in the future. Liberian President Tubman had returned home earlier, and a representative leading the Liberian delegation in his place said at the meeting that with the convening of this conference, Africans can rest assured that they have now begun to concentrate the great potential power of this great continent to fight for peace and progress.

A Tunisian representative stressed that as long as there are non-independent countries in Africa, "our independence is incomplete." He said that the message of this conference is a message of justice, freedom and brotherhood. The conference has strengthened the unity of the participants and contributed to world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, 23rd—In the resolution on economic and social issues adopted on the 22nd, the African Independent States Conference recommended the establishment of a joint economic research committee, whose task is to: coordinate information and exchange views on economic and technical issues of the various independent African countries; formulate measures to develop and encourage trade between African countries; study the possibility of coordinating national economic plans; explore ways to develop common industrial plans for African countries, and study the possibility of African countries supplying each other with mineral resources and other African products; and suggest that African independent countries may accept foreign capital, employ foreign experts and encourage cooperation with other countries in a manner that does not affect their sovereignty, independence and unity. The resolution also recommends strengthening their cooperation with specialized agencies of the United Nations, particularly with the newly proposed Economic Commission for Africa; making joint efforts to build transportation facilities between African countries; investigating the possibility of eventually establishing an African common market; exchanging labor and labor information and encouraging cooperation between national trade union organizations; and strengthening cooperation with the International Labor Organization.

In the resolution on cultural issues, the conference recommended that African independent states conclude common cultural agreements and establish cultural centers in each other's countries.

The resolution said that colonialism is detrimental to national culture and hinders any possible cooperation.

In the resolution on permanent institutions, the conference expressed unanimous agreement to convene meetings of foreign ministers, other ministers or experts at any time necessary to study and deal with specific issues of common concern to African countries.
