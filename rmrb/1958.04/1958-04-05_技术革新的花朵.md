    Flowers of Technological Innovation
    Experimental Work Zone Supports Seedlings
    (Our newspaper, Kunming, 4th dispatch) Workers and technicians at the Southwest Instrument Factory created, innovated, and improved 706 technologies in the first quarter, increasing machine efficiency by more than tenfold. As a result, they overfulfilled their plans every month. The total output value actually completed in March increased by 2.8 times compared to February.
    During the Two-Anti campaign at the Southwest Instrument Factory, the political enthusiasm and production zeal of all employees were unprecedentedly high. Many veteran workers and technicians proposed taking the path of technological innovation to realize this year's leap forward plan. Based on these suggestions, the factory Party committee put forward the slogan of "Comparing Enthusiasm, Comparing Innovation." The Party committee secretary, factory director, and chief engineer led cadres in political work, management work, and technical work to establish experimental work zones in the second and third workshops, working with the workshop cadres and laboring alongside the workers. In the course of their labor, they promptly discovered many budding technological innovations, helped workers experiment, and assigned technicians to assist.
    The task of manufacturing auto parts in the second workshop this year has increased significantly compared to last year, but the workshop's equipment is unbalanced, with a shortage of lathes and a surplus of milling machines. Veteran worker Li Huayu devised a way to install three parts, including a movable thimble base, on the milling machine. While retaining the performance of the milling machine, he enabled the milling machine to perform the work of a lathe, increasing efficiency by five to ten times. All fourteen milling machines in the workshop were equipped with these three parts, which solved the difficulty of insufficient lathes. Zhang Hongbiao, the technical director of the second workshop, and the workers of the caliper section jointly created a caliper surface grinding machine. One person can operate four machines simultaneously, increasing efficiency by twenty times, and the quality fully meets the requirements, catching up with the advanced level in the country. As a result, the caliper production target has increased to 30,000. Engineer Wang Yuanyou and technician Gui Yongcai are also creating an oil nozzle inner hole grinding machine to transform manual operation into mechanization.
    With the help of veteran workers and technicians, young workers have also proposed more than one hundred technical innovations and improvements. (Ye Zijian)
    Youth Milling Workers Battlefield Conference
    (Our newspaper) Shenyang Second Machine Tool Factory's tool workshop youth milling worker Li Yumin, with the help of veteran masters and technicians, recently successfully trial-produced the Soviet Karasev's advanced cutting tool, improving efficiency tenfold and extending the life of the milling cutter. In order to promote his experience, the factory's Communist Youth League committee convened a battlefield conference in the tool workshop, gathering more than one hundred people, including all the factory's youth milling workers and youth technicians. At the meeting, Li Yumin introduced his experience and gave an operational demonstration.
    This method of on-the-spot demonstration and immediate transmission of advanced technology is very effective. Currently, fifteen milling workers in the tool workshop are using the new cutting tool successfully trial-produced by Li Yumin. Milling workers in other workshops are also preparing to adopt this cutting tool. Following Li Yumin, six young workers have improved four kinds of cutting tools and operation methods, increasing efficiency by two to eight times.
    Breakthrough in European and American Design Theory
    (Our newspaper, Chongqing, 4th dispatch) Recently, the output of glass melt per square meter of furnace bottom in the No. 1 tank furnace of the Chongqing Beibei Glass Factory reached 1,100 kilograms, exceeding the design theory of European and American capitalist countries by 300 kilograms. This tank furnace, designed with a capacity of five tons, produced an average of four tons of glass melt per day last year, but now it reaches more than six tons, and the glass products produced reach 5.1 tons.

    Heroes Arise Together
    (Our newspaper, Chongqing, 4th dispatch) The workers of Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, with learning from and catching up with Liao Shigang and Liao Sirong as their action slogan, have launched a high tide of breaking with conventions and boldly innovating technology. In the recent twenty-odd days, the entire factory has achieved significant results due to technological innovation. More than 260 workers have proposed completing the equivalent of five years of work in two or three months, and they have increased production efficiency by more than ten to dozens of times.
    As the factory's pacesetter, young milling worker Liao Shigang and young drilling worker Liao Sirong have recently achieved new successes. Liao Shigang has already realized the first step of his plan to have one person manage four machine tools and control five processes. He is further improving the processes on the basis of multi-clamping workpieces, multi-watching machines, and multi-managing processes, so that one person can master five machine tools and manage seven processes. With catching up with Liao Shigang and Liao Sirong as the center, the entire factory has formed a new situation of heroes arising together. Liu Maojue, a young worker from the 34th workshop, is one of the most eye-catching figures among the newly emerging figures. After learning from Liao Shigang's experience, he took over the management of seven machine tools, which were originally watched by three people.
    100 Minutes and 125 Days
    Song Tingxiang, the young fitter group leader of the punching and welding workshop of the Nanjing State-owned Chenguang Machinery Factory, boldly improved technology and manufactured tools, using machines instead of manual operation, which increased the production efficiency of a cylinder liner component by more than 600 times. The task that originally took a worker 125 days to complete can now be completed in just 100 minutes.

    技术革新的花朵
    试验工区扶植幼芽
    本报昆明4日电　西南仪器厂工人、技术人员在第一季度中，创造、革新和改进了七百零六项技术，使机器工作效率提高十倍以上，因此月月超额完成计划，其中3月份实际完成的总产值比2月份增加二点八倍。
    西南仪器厂在双反运动中，全厂职工的政治积极性和生产热情空前提高。许多老工人、技术人员都提出应走技术革新的道路，来实现今年跃进计划。根据这些意见，厂党委提出了比干劲、比革新的口号。党委书记、厂长、总工程师分别带领政治工作、管理工作和技术工作干部，到二、三车间建立试验工区，和车间的干部一起工作，和工人们一块劳动。他们在劳动过程中及时发现了许多技术革新的萌芽，帮助工人试验，指定技术人员加以协助。
    二车间今年制造汽车零件的任务比去年增加了许多，但车间的设备不平衡、车床不足、铣床有余。老工人李华玉就设法在铣床上安装活动顶针座等三样零件，在保留铣床性能的情况下，使铣床代替车床干活，而且效率提高了五倍到十倍。车间里十四部铣床都装上这三种零件，就解决了车床不够的困难。二车间技术主任张宏彪和卡尺工段的工人们，共同创造成功一台卡尺量面研磨机，一个人可以同时操作四台机器，效率提高了二十倍，质量完全合乎要求，赶上了全国的先进水平，卡尺生产指标因而增加到了三万把。工程师王原有、技师桂永才也正在创造一部喷油嘴内孔研磨机，把手工操作变成机械化。
    青年工人们在老工人和技术人员的帮助下，也提出了一百多件技术上的革新和改进意见。　（叶子健）
    青年铣工战地会议
    本报讯　沈阳第二机床厂工具车间青年铣工李育民，在老师傅和技术人员的帮助下，最近试制成功了苏联卡拉谢夫的先进刀具，提高效率十倍，并且能延长铣刀的寿命。为了推广他的经验，工厂团委便召集全厂青年铣工、青年技术人员等一百多人，在工具车间开战地会议。会上，李育民介绍了自己的经验并作了操作表演。
    这种就地表演，当场传授先进技术的方法效果很好。目前工具车间已有十五个铣工使用李育民试制成功的新刀具。其它车间的铣工也在准备采用这种刀具。继李育民之后，已有六名青年工人改进了四种刀具和操作方法，提高了效率二至八倍。
    突破了欧美设计理论
    本报重庆4日电　最近，重庆市北碚玻璃厂职工一号池炉每平方公尺炉底的玻璃溶料产量达到了一千一百公斤，比欧美资本主义国家的设计理论超过了三百公斤。这座设计能力五吨的池炉，去年平均每天生产四吨玻璃溶料，现在达到六吨以上，制出的玻璃制品达到五吨一百公斤。
          （李　策）
    群雄并起
    本报重庆4日电　重庆建设机床厂的工人们，以学习与赶上廖世刚、廖思荣作为行动口号，掀起了打破陈规、大胆革新技术的热潮。在最近的二十几天内，全厂由于革新技术获得重大成就。提出用二、三个月的时间，完成相当于五年工作量的工人，已经有二百六十多人，他们把生产效率提高了十几倍到几十倍。
    作为全厂竞赛标兵的青年铣工廖世刚和青年钻工廖思荣最近又有新的成就。廖世刚已经实现了一人看管四部机床、管着五道工序的第一步规划。他正在实行多夹工件，多看机床，多管工序的基础上，进一步改进工序，以便一个人掌握五部机床，管七道工序。以赶廖世刚、廖思荣为中心，全厂形成了群雄并起的新局面。三十四车间青年工人刘茂爵是新起的人物中最惹人注目的一个。他学习廖世刚的经验之后，把原来由三个人看的七台机床，一个人看管起来。
    100分钟和125天
    南京国营晨光机器厂冲焊车间青年钳工组长宋庭祥大胆改进技术，制造工具，用机械代替手工操作，使一种搪缸机另件的生产效率提高六百倍以上，原来一个工人要做一百二十五天的任务，现在只要一百分钟就可完成了。
