Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, April 18th: The Zhuang language literacy campaign has been fully launched in more than forty counties of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. More than 540,000 people are participating in learning this spring. Among them, more than 100,000 people are already able to use the Zhuang language to calculate work points, and some have already joined the junior high school classes in spare-time schools.

More than 30,000 Zhuang language promoters are active in the countryside, and 52 Zhuang language schools in the region are continuing to train teachers in large numbers. The Zhuang people have a very high enthusiasm for learning. The masses in the Bama Yao Autonomous County do not mind the long and steep roads, nor are they afraid of the dark and slippery slopes. Every night, they cross mountains and rivers to study in literacy classes several miles away.

In order to make literacy work able to adapt to the busy situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, various counties are summarizing and promoting the experience of combining learning with production. The Party and Youth League secretaries of the Ping Shang Agricultural Cooperative in Huaiyuan Township, Yishan County, personally lead the learning of the Zhuang language. Cooperative and team cadres are the backbone of learning. Learning classes are divided by production team, so that all illiterate cooperative members participate in learning. They write Zhuang language letters on various farm tools, furniture, and inside and outside walls of houses, and hang small blackboards in the fields, closely combining learning with production.

    结合生产办法好　群众学习热情高
    僮文扫盲大有成效
    新华社南宁18日电　僮文扫盲运动已在广西僮族自治区的四十多个县全面展开。今春参加学习的有五十四万多人。其中有十多万人已经能够用僮文计工分，有的已经参加了业余学校高小班学习。
    有三万多名僮文推行人员活跃在农村，全区五十二个僮文学校正在继续大量培养师资。僮族人民群众学习情绪十分高涨。巴马瑶族自治县的群众不嫌路远山高，不怕天黑坡滑，每晚翻山涉水到几里路外的学习班去学习。
    为了使扫盲工作能够适应农业生产大跃进的繁忙情况，各县都在总结和推广结合生产进行学习的经验。宜山县怀远乡坪上农业社的党、团支部书记都亲自领导学习僮文，社、队干部就是学习骨干，以生产队划分学习班，这样所有文盲社员都参加了学习。他们在各种农具、家俱和屋内外墙壁上写上僮文字母，田头上挂起小黑板，紧密结合生产进行学习。
