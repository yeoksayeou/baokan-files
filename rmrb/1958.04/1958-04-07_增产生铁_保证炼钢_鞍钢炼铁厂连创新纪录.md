    增产生铁　保证炼钢
    鞍钢炼铁厂连创新纪录
    据新华社鞍山6日电　鞍钢炼铁厂在最近半个月中，连续创造了十二次新的生产纪录，其中有两次是高炉利用系数全国新纪录。
    炼铁厂在4月2日创造的日产量纪录，比国家计划多生产了四百五十吨生铁，比3月份的平均日产量增产六百多吨。全厂九座大型高炉中，有五座高炉在这半个月中连续创造了一次到三次本高炉开炉以来的创日产量新纪录，生铁的质量都达到了百分之百。三号高炉在3月27日创造利用系数零点五八七的新纪录后，28日又达到了零点五七二，刷新了四号高炉24日创造的零点五八三的全国纪录，也超过了太原钢铁厂一号高炉职工创造的零点五七七的新成绩。
    炼铁厂职工在连创新纪录的鼓舞下，决心争取在4月份获得更大的成就，为全年增产十二万五千吨生铁创造条件。
