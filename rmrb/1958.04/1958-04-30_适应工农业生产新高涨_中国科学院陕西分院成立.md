Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th—The Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was formally established on April 27th. The Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences, and seven other research institutes (or research offices) under the branch, covering Power, Chemical Engineering, Geology, Mining and Metallurgy, Agricultural Machinery, and Endemic Disease Epidemiology, were also formally established on the same day.

On the same evening, the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held its first Academy Affairs Committee meeting. The meeting decided to establish four academic groups: Basic Sciences, Biology, Technical Sciences, and Philosophy and Social Sciences. The task of these groups is to assist the Academy Affairs Committee in its work. The meeting also discussed the interim meeting system for the Academy Affairs Committee and the Academy Affairs Meetings, and approved the list of heads of the various institutes and research offices. The establishment of the Shaanxi Branch of the Academy of Sciences and the seven scientific research institutions is to adapt to the new upsurge in the local industrial and agricultural economy and the impending mass technical revolution and cultural revolution. Recently, more than 700 relatively important technical creations and improvements have emerged in factories and mines in Shaanxi Province, and a large number of "living Lubans" have emerged among farmers. In the past month alone, Dali County has created 70 new farm tools. The Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County has practically become an agricultural college, with everyone studying science and technology, and more than 60% to 70% of the members understanding general scientific and technical knowledge. They have cultivated more than 100 varieties of wheat alone. Absorbing and summarizing these new creations of the workers and peasants and then improving and popularizing them has become an urgent problem.

The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to establish the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on the 11th of this month, and the relevant departments immediately prepared for it, and it was formally established half a month later. After the establishment of the branch of the Academy of Sciences and the various research institutions, it is planned to use the main force to study the most urgent scientific and technological problems raised in the current local industrial and agricultural production, and to combine this with the study of certain fundamental scientific theories and the latest technologies.

In order to carry out mass scientific research work, five special districts in Shaanxi Province will each establish a comprehensive agricultural science research institution within this year, and establish agricultural experimental research institutions in counties where conditions permit, and establish agricultural technology experiment stations and meteorological stations in some townships and agricultural cooperatives, gradually achieving county-level science and cooperative-level experiments, forming a province-wide scientific and technological research network.

Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the founding meeting, saying: The establishment of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences marks that scientific research in the Shaanxi region will enter a new stage of vigorous development. Its task is to organize the scientific forces in the Shaanxi region, to go all out, aim high and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results in developing scientific undertakings. First of all, we must emancipate our minds and break the mystical view that science and technology are unattainable, and the conservative idea that we must wait until everything is ready before we can start scientific research. Scientific research must serve production and serve socialism; we must rely on the masses and even more on experts, and combine experts with the masses.

    适应工农业生产新高涨
    中国科学院陕西分院成立
    新华社西安28日电　中国科学院陕西分院于4月27日正式成立。科学分院下设的哲学社会科学研究所和动力、化工、地质、采矿冶金、农业机具和地方病流行病等七个研究所（室）也于同日正式成立。
    同日晚，中国科学院陕西分院召开了第一次院务委员会。会上决定设立基础科学、生物学、技术科学和哲学社会科学等四个学组，并确定了学组的任务是协助院务委员会进行工作。会议还讨论了院务委员会及院务会议暂行会议制度，通过了各研究所、室的负责人名单。科学院陕西分院和七个科学研究机构，是为了适应当地工农业经济新高涨和群众性技术革命、文化革命即将到来的新形势而成立的。陕西省工厂矿山中，最近出现了七百多件比较重要的技术创造和改良，农民中涌现了大批“活鲁班”。大荔县在最近一个月当中创造了七十件新农具；醴泉县烽火农业社简直成了农学院，人人学科学技术，60％、70％以上的社员都懂得一般科学技术知识，他们仅小麦就培育了一百多个品种。吸取和总结工农群众的这些新的创造再加以提高和普及已成为当前迫不及待的问题。
    中共陕西省委在本月11日决定成立中国科学院陕西分院，有关部门立即筹备，半个月后便正式成立。科学分院和各研究机构建立后，计划以主要力量来研究当前地方工农业生产中提出的最迫切的科学技术问题，并结合研究若干根本性的科学理论和最新技术。
    为了展开群众性的科学研究工作，陕西省在今年年内有五个专区将各建立一所综合性的农业科学研究机构，并在有条件的县建立农业试验研究机构，在一些乡、农业社建立农业技术试验站和气象站等，逐步作到县县办科学，社社搞试验，组成一个全省性的科学技术研究网。
    中共陕西省委第一书记张德生在成立大会上讲了话，他说：中国科学院陕西分院的成立，标志着陕西地区的科学研究工作将进入一个蓬勃发展的新阶段。它的任务就是要组织陕西地区的科学力量，鼓足干劲、多快好省地发展科学事业。首先要解放思想，打破那种把科学技术看成是高不可攀的神秘观念，和要等待万事具备才去动手搞科学研究的保守思想；科学研究必须为生产服务，为社会主义服务；要依靠群众，更要依靠专家，做到专家和群众相结合。
