    Cherish Machines!
    Mass Movement Launched in Luoyang
    (Our dispatch) Luoyang City's newly built factories have launched a movement to maintain machinery and equipment.
    The Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held an on-site meeting at the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant to promote the plant's experience in maintaining machinery and equipment. The Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant is a newly built modern factory that has not yet officially begun production. However, over the past year or so, during the installation of equipment and adjustment of production, many new machines were damaged. During the rectification campaign, the plant's leaders, based on the opinions of the masses, organized a special airing of views and debates throughout the plant on the topic of maintaining machinery and equipment. Leading cadres first rigorously examined themselves, and then organized a large debate among the workers. On the basis of raising the ideological understanding of the masses, various systems for maintaining machinery and equipment were formulated, and organizations for maintaining and inspecting machinery and equipment were established. Soon, the factory took on a new look of cleanliness and sparkling machines. The workers took great care of the machines.
    A number of large-scale enterprises newly built by the state in Luoyang have entered the stage of installing equipment and adjusting production. In the past, the phenomenon of insufficient maintenance of new machinery and equipment in these enterprises was quite common. Now, this situation has been transformed.

    爱护机器！
    洛阳开展群众运动
    本报讯　洛阳市各新建工厂展开维护机器设备的运动。
    中共洛阳市委不久以前曾在洛阳矿山机器厂召开现场会议，推广了这个厂维护机器设备的经验。洛阳矿山机器厂是新建的一个现代化的工厂，目前还没有正式投入生产。但是，过去一年多来，在安装设备和调整生产当中，损坏了不少新机器。在整风运动中，这个厂的领导人员根据群众的意见，组织全厂开展了维护机器设备的专题鸣放。领导干部首先严格检查了自己，然后在职工中组织了大辩论。在群众思想认识提高的基础上，制定了各种维护机器设备的制度，建立了维护和检查保养机器设备的机构。不久，厂里便出现了到处整洁、机器晶亮的新气象。工人们对机器十分爱护。
    国家在洛阳新建的一些大型企业，都已经进入了安装设备和调整生产的阶段。过去，这些企业中对新机器设备维护不够的现象相当普遍。现在，这种情况已经转变。
