    Jianshe Township Realizes Terraced Fields, Finding a Path for Mountainous Areas to Develop Agricultural Production
    (Our Report) The Communist Party of China's Yun County Committee in Hubei Province has decided to promote the experience of Jianshe Township in realizing terraced fields throughout the county, requiring that all mountainous cultivated land be fixed within three years, ensuring that each person has three mu of terraced fields.
    Jianshe Township is a mountainous area 1,200 meters above sea level. In the past, it was almost all slopes covered with "ma guo ke" soil, which would turn into bare rock after a few heavy rains. "Digging this mountain, discarding that mountain," "cultivating wasteland here, abandoning cultivated land there," cultivated land could not be fixed, and soil erosion was serious, thus making it impossible for the farmers in this township to change their poverty. Before liberation, one mu of land could only yield 50 to 60 jin of grain a year. They angrily said: "If you want the granary to be full, unless you change the dynasty." After cooperativization, the farmers' desire to improve the land was realized; especially since the large-scale water conservancy projects were undertaken last winter and this spring, the speed of land improvement in this township has developed by leaps and bounds. "Yesterday it looked like a barren mountain, today it looks like wheat fields, tomorrow morning when you look again, the wheat ears will be full of the mountain." The farmers use these lyrics to describe how much, how fast, how good, and how economical their land improvement is. The township originally had less than 600 mu of guaranteed harvest land, but now it has developed to 6,500 mu, accounting for more than 80% of the total cultivated land area, basically realizing terraced fields.
    Not only has the natural landscape undergone fundamental changes here, but the economic landscape is also changing greatly. In 1955, the state supplied the township with more than 300,000 jin of grain. Last year, with more than 2,000 mu of paddy fields and the improvement of some slopes, it became a surplus grain township, selling more than 300,000 jin of surplus grain.
    Now, with the conversion of slopes into terraced fields, the farmers in the township have set off a high tide of technical revolution. They have created various small farm tools suitable for use in terraced fields, solving the difficulty that plows and harrows cannot be used in small fields. Of the township's 56 production teams, 14 had never grown paddy fields before. After mutual teaching and learning, they have now mastered rice transplanting and cultivation techniques.
    Recently, the Hubei Provincial Agricultural Inspection Team came to this township and was deeply impressed by the layers of terraced fields, like brocade paintings, spiraling from the foot of the mountain to the top. After listening to the report of Yang Mingdao, deputy secretary of the township branch, they believed that the experience of Jianshe Township had found a path for the development of agriculture in mountainous areas and was worth promoting to all regions.

### 建设乡实现梯田梯地化  给山区发展农业生产找到了门径

    建设乡实现梯田梯地化
    给山区发展农业生产找到了门径
    本报讯　中共湖北郧县县委决定在全县范围内推广建设乡实现梯田梯地化的经验，要求在三年内，把山区耕地全部固定下来，作到每人有三亩梯田梯地。
    建设乡是个拔海一千二百公尺的山区。过去这里差不多都是麻果壳坡地，遇几次大雨就冲成光板。
  “挖这山，丢那山”，“这边开生荒，那边丢熟荒”，耕地不能固定，水土流失严重，因而使这个乡的农民没法改变贫困。解放前，一年一亩地只能收五、六十斤粮食。他们愤怒地说：“要想仓里有粮装，除非改朝换帝王”。合作化以后，农民的改田愿望实现了；特别是去冬今春大搞水利以来，这个乡的改田速度更是飞跃发展。“昨天来看是荒山，今天来看是麦田，明天清早再来看，麦苗穗儿长满山。”农民们用这些歌词来形容他们改田又多又快又好又省。全乡原有保收田不到六百亩，现在已发展到六千五百亩，占总耕地面积80％以上，基本实现了梯田梯地化。
    这里现在不仅自然面貌起了根本变化，经济面貌也在大大变化。1955年国家供应全乡三十多万斤粮食。去年有了二千多亩水田和改了一部分坡地，就变成余粮乡了，卖余粮三十多万斤。
    现在，随着坡地改梯田，全乡农民又掀起了技术革命高潮。他们创制了各种各样适合于梯田梯地用的小农具，解决了小田不能用犁、耙的困难。全乡五十六个生产队，原来没有种过田的有十四个队，经过互教互学，现在也都掌握了插秧培育技术。
    最近，湖北省农业检查团来到这个乡，看到了这里如锦似画的一层层梯田梯地，螺丝似的从山脚盘到山顶，留下了深刻的印象。他们在听取了乡支部副书记杨明道同志的汇报后，认为建设乡的经验给山区农业发展找到了途径，值得向各地推广。
