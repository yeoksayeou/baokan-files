Seeing it in Person is Worth More Than Ten Years of Study
Science and Technology Workers Visit the Tianjin Special Zone's Low-Lying Area Transformation

(Reported by our reporter Lan Cun) "Seeing it in person is worth more than ten years of study." This is the sentiment expressed by agricultural scientists who visited the low-lying area transformation in the Tianjin Special Zone earlier this month. It seems that visiting the site, conducting investigations and research, can be said to be an extremely important method for science and technology experts to integrate with reality and thoroughly transform their thinking.

This visit was organized by the State Council's Scientific Planning Commission. In addition to the 77 representatives from agricultural science societies from various provinces who came to Beijing to attend the report meeting of the "Chinese Delegation to the Soviet Union for Science and Technology," there were also more than 40 scientists, engineers, and agricultural workers from units such as the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing Agricultural University, the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory. Including staff from relevant scientific units, there were about 130 people in total. The visit lasted three days from April 1st to 3rd. The visitors first gathered in Yangliuqing, the location of the Tianjin Prefectural Party Committee, to listen to the report by Zhao Ke, the first secretary of the Prefectural Party Committee, on the transformation of low-lying areas and flood control. Then, they went to visit and investigate separately. Finally, they held a discussion to talk about their impressions and also provided active suggestions to the local area in terms of science and technology.

Most of the visitors had seen reports about the deeds and experiences of the Tianjin Special Zone in transforming low-lying areas in newspapers. However, when everyone personally listened to Comrade Zhao Ke's report and saw the tremendous changes in real life and its development prospects, they further realized the greatness of the Party's leadership and the power of the masses, and further recognized that science and technology workers can only serve production and play their due role by opening their hearts to the Party, going to the masses, and becoming students of the masses. The scientists visited Tuanbo, one of the more than 90 low-lying areas in the entire special zone. Two years ago, this place was still a vast expanse of water, with 370,000 mu of water accumulation on more than 500,000 mu of land. What everyone sees now is tens of thousands of mu of fertile land composed of rectangular, uniform plots separated by crisscrossing canals. Here, rice has been developed on more than 200,000 mu, and has achieved bumper harvests for two consecutive years. The maximum yield over a large area has approached 1,000 jin per mu. The fishery and reed industry has also developed. Who would have thought that the saline-alkali wasteland of two years ago would have become a land of fish and rice so quickly! What about the lives of the masses? The scientists visited Shenghong Agricultural Cooperative and Yongyuan Agricultural Cooperative separately. In Shenghong Cooperative, the director of the cooperative, Wang Lianhai, told everyone that before the transformation of the low-lying area, the average person here had only 119 jin of grain per year, relying entirely on yellow alfalfa grown on saline-alkali land to satisfy their hunger. In the past two years, however, they have been eating "Yinfang" rice (commonly known as "Xiaozhan rice") every day. Last year, the average net income from agriculture and sideline occupations per labor force in the whole cooperative was 700 yuan. In two years, the output and income have increased not by one or two times, but by seven or eight times, or even ten times! This year, they plan to apply 10,000 jin of natural fertilizer and 60 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu, and have also made a series of preparations in terms of cultivation technology, striving for an average yield of 1,800 jin per mu. The past and present of Tuanbo is also the past and present of the Tianjin low-lying area transformation region. Here, people saw the earth-shaking changes in the lives of more than 3 million farmers in the surrounding 12 counties and cities. Everyone was deeply moved by this change.

The Great Power of the Masses of Farmers: Building Their Own Hydropower Station

What most encouraged and educated the agricultural scientists was the heroic spirit and infinite wisdom of the masses here in building a new socialist countryside. Due to the fundamental changes in the production base, the masses are no longer satisfied with the existing production conditions, and they urgently demand electrification and mechanization as soon as possible. The Party organization here relied on the masses to control water and develop rice, and now fully supports the demands of the masses, actively leading the masses in the arduous cause of electrification and mechanization. Without science and technology experts, they gathered the blacksmiths, carpenters, stonemasons, and bricklayers in the countryside, and experimented, constructed, and trained together with the cadres. At the Yangliuqing Agricultural Exhibition, scientists saw dozens of kinds of agricultural machinery and tools made by the masses themselves. The vast majority of the machines and tools cost little and had good work efficiency. In Wulizhuang, Jinghai County, scientists saw a small hydropower station with 13.6 horsepower built by the masses themselves in nine days. In five small villages with more than 600 households, they grind flour during the day and provide lighting at night. In Chenguantun, everyone saw a 32-horsepower hydropower station built in only five days at a cost of 2,000 yuan (six small hydropower stations like this have been built in the entire region). On the city wall in the southeast corner of Jinghai County, wind power generation has been preliminarily trial-produced (there are already five places in the entire region). In Jinghai County and Yangliuqing, experiments with biogas have also been initially successful. In Yangliuqing, a student from Tianjin, a young girl named Qin, gave the scientists an on-site biogas lighting demonstration. It is she who, under the leadership and support of the Party, is beginning to build the biogas power generation industry in the entire special zone. Comrade Zhao Ke told everyone in his report that many cadres and masses are now conducting experiments and research as if they were fascinated, and one township chief has created seven tools in a row. The Party clearly sees that with objective needs and the awakening of the masses, there is a foundation for electrification and mechanization. Therefore, today's electrification and mechanization also adopt the principle of relying on the masses, focusing on small-scale projects. Comrade Zhao Ke said in his report that with many small-scale projects, they will become large-scale projects. The accumulation of small projects into large ones is what truly makes them large. The masses themselves are not afraid of mistakes in small-scale projects. If they are wrong, they will correct them, and in the end, they will always be right. This is the reality. More than 90% of the low-lying area transformation projects in the entire special zone are self-managed by the masses. Of course, these projects are not very "formalized" and appear very simple on the surface, but the facts prove that all projects can have widespread effectiveness. Biogas digesters originally required cement, but it has been proven here that brine from refining saltpeter mixed with clay can also be used instead of cement. With the mass creation of various innovations, coupled with the necessary support from the state, the speed of rural mechanization, electrification, and chemization can be very fast. Now, a six-row rice transplanter has been successfully trial-produced and ranked third in the evaluation in Nanjing; a seeding machine has been made; a small tractor can be made in the second half of this year; and the daily output of gas engines has increased from seven to twenty-four. Of course, the requirements for electrification and mechanization are also a process from elementary to advanced. The current requirements are: using electricity for irrigation and drainage, agricultural and sideline product processing, and night lighting; and mechanization mainly uses machines for transplanting, sowing, and harvesting. The unified understanding of the Party organization and the masses here is: not afraid of being crude and simple, only afraid of losing time. Achieving electrification and mechanization one year earlier will make the countryside prosperous one year earlier, and the country's socialist construction can be completed one year earlier.

"Flowers Hidden in the Leaves" Will Revolutionize Rice Variety Classification

All of this, for many scientists who came to visit this time, was either unexpected or not very clear even if they had thought of it. Therefore, at the symposium of all the visitors, Li Kezuo, an agricultural machinery engineer, said, "Seeing it in person is worth more than ten years of study," and everyone felt the same way. Li Kezuo said: Now that I have personally seen the technical forces that have grown up among the broad masses, and seen the output increase several times, I feel that our country's "poverty and backwardness" will become a historical term. Many scientists, like him, saw the great future of the motherland. The famous rice expert, Dean of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Ding Ying, learned during the visit that a japonica rice variety here called "Flowers Hidden in the Leaves" can be planted in deep water, dry land, and ordinary paddy fields. He said that this is an amazing thing for the world's rice science, and with this variety, rice variety taxonomy will be revolutionized. Dai Songen, deputy director of the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, said that last winter in the Soviet Union, he learned that the Soviet Union was vigorously developing the biogas industry, and thought that we were still a blank sheet of paper in this regard. He did not expect that we would quickly carry out a lot of work in the utilization of biogas.

The Role of Scientists is Like Tofu Curd

Faced with such tremendous changes that are changing with each passing day, scientists feel that they are out of touch with reality and the masses. Li Kezuo said in the discussion: "Seeing the machinery and tools invented and created by the masses at the Yangliuqing Agricultural Exhibition, they are very simple, but the efficiency is good. The characteristic is that they are adapted to local conditions and meet local technical and economic conditions. But when we start, it is very complicated. It seems that it is not complicated and cannot represent the 'level' of engineering technology, and it is out of touch with the current real conditions. If you only want to engage in large-scale and complex things, you can't do it, and the work will be stopped. This is called a slight deviation that leads to a great loss." He also said that he always thought that to engage in socialist construction, only large factories and large projects should be built, so there should be many engineering and technical personnel and many scientists. According to this calculation, socialist construction would take a lot of time to achieve. Now I have a deeper understanding that the main force in building socialism lies in the farmers and workers. In the past, it seemed that engaging in socialist construction "cannot be done without me." I did not see the great power of the masses. In fact, the role of scientists is only like tofu curd. The masses create various experiences, and scientists add some curd to them to become tofu. Fan Chifu of the Electric Power Design Institute believes that scientists in the past were "marching slowly and steadily" and their ideas and practices were completely different from those of the masses. What was originally thought to be a design for the countryside is now considered to be far behind the creative talents of the masses. The masses are making great leaps forward, but they are lagging behind.

Why are we out of touch with reality and the masses? Scientists have touched the depths of their thoughts. Fan Chifu put it well, he said that the relationship between intellectuals and the masses is not deep, mainly because intellectuals stand outside the masses and always think that it is "I give you" to the masses, like Jesus. He gave an example, saying that a technician designed a project, and the masses felt that it was wasteful and asked to reduce the cost of materials. The technician said: "You can reduce it, you are responsible if it is broken, I am not responsible." Fan Chifu believes that this example shows such an idea of intellectuals: the leap forward is a matter for the masses, and I will leap forward if I can become famous and profitable, otherwise I will stand aside. Gu Qianzhen, professor of Northwest Jiaotong University, believes that the reason why farmers can create is because they are doing their own things. If scientists regard the affairs of the masses as their own, they can also create. Xie Shen, professor of South China Agricultural College, said that without communist consciousness, there is no creative labor. After this visit, scientists all expressed that they would go to the masses and honestly become students of the masses. Many people expressed that they would strive to be both red and expert, and believe that Zhao Ke, secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Party Committee, is a model of being both red and expert.

    现场看一看　胜读十年书
    科学技术工作者参观天津专区洼地改造
    本报讯　记者蓝村报道：“现场看一看，胜读十年书”。这是本月初到天津专区参观洼地改造的农业科学家们发表的感想。看来，到现场去参观访问，进行调查研究，可以说是科学技术专家结合实际、彻底改造思想的一个极为重要的方法。
    这次参观是国务院科学规划委员会组织的。参加者除了全国各省到北京来参加“中国访苏科学技术代表团”传达报告会的农业科学各学会的代表七十七人以外，还有中国农业科学院、北京农业大学、水利科学研究院、水利电力部、北京农业机械厂等单位的科学家、工程师、农业工作者等四十多人。连有关科学单位的工作人员共约一百三十人。参观日期自4月1日至3日共三天。参观者首先集中在中共天津地委所在地杨柳青，听取了地委第一书记赵克同志关于洼地改造和治涝的报告，然后分头进行参观访问，最后举行座谈，谈观感，也给当地提供科学技术方面的积极建议。
    天津专区改造洼地的事迹和经验，绝大部分参观者都是在报纸上看到了的。可是，当大家亲自听了赵克同志的报告，又身临其境看到了现实生活的巨大变化和它的发展前景的时候，才进一步体会到党的领导和群众力量的伟大，进一步认识到科学技术工作者只有向党交心，到群众中去，当群众的学生，才能为生产服务，起到应有的作用。科学家们参观了全专区九十多个洼地之一的团泊洼。两年前的今天，这里还是一片汪洋，五十多万亩土地，有三十七万亩积水。而现在大家所看到的，却是纵横的渠道隔开的一片片长方形的匀整地块所构成的万顷良田。在这里，水稻已经发展了二十多万亩，连获了两年丰收。大面积的最高产量已经接近每亩千片。渔苇业也发展起来了。谁想得到两年前的盐碱荒洼，这样快就变成了鱼米之乡！群众的生活怎么样呢？科学家们分头访问了这里的升红农业社和永远农业社。在升红社，社主任王连海告诉大家，洼地改造以前，这里每人每年平均只有一百一十九斤粮食，全靠盐碱地上生长的黄蓿菜充饥。这两年来，每天每顿吃的却是“银坊”大米（即通常所谓“小站米”）了。去年，全社每个劳动力平均农副业净收入七百元。两年之间，产量和收入不是一、二倍而是七、八倍、上十倍地增长了！今年，他们准备每亩施自然肥一万斤，化肥六十斤，耕作技术上也作好了一系列的准备，要争取平均亩产一千八百斤。团泊洼的今昔，也就是天津洼改地区的今昔。在这里，人们看到了周围十二个县市、三百多万农民生活翻天覆地的变化。大家都为这个变化深深感动。
    农民群众力量大  自己建成水电站
    农业科学家们最为振奋而深受教育的，是这里的群众建设社会主义新农村的英雄气概和无穷的智慧。由于生产基础的根本改变，群众已经不能满足于现有的生产条件，他们迫切要求尽快地电气化，机械化。这里的党组织依靠群众治了水发展了水稻，现在又充分支持群众的要求，积极领导群众从事电气化机械化的艰巨事业。没有科学技术专家，就把农村中的铁匠、木匠、石匠、泥瓦匠集中起来，和干部一起边试验、边建设、边训练。在杨柳青农业展览会上，科学家们看到了群众自制的几十种农业机械和工具，绝大部分机具，都花钱少、工效好。在静海县五里庄，科学家们看到了群众自己用九天时间建成的一座十三点六马力的小型水力发电站。在六百多户的五个小村中，白天磨面，黑夜照明。在陈官屯，大家又看到了只用五天时间，花钱二千元建造起来的三十二马力的水力发电站（像这一类的小型水电站全区已建成了六座）。在静海县东南角的城墙上，风力发电已经初步试制成功（全区已有了五处）。在静海县城和杨柳青两地，沼气的试验也初步成功了。在杨柳青，当场给科学家们作沼气照明表演的，是一位从天津来的学生、一位姓秦的年轻姑娘。就是她，在党的领导和支持下，正在开始建设全专区的沼气发电的事业。赵克同志在他的报告中告诉大家，现在许多干部和群众，像着了迷似地在进行试验和研究，有一位乡长，一连创造了七件工具。党清楚地看到，有了客观的需要和群众的觉悟，电气化、机械化就有了基础。因此，今天的电气化机械化也是采取依靠群众的方针，以小型为主。赵克同志在他的报告中说，有了众多的小型，也就成了大型，由小积成的大，才是真正的大。群众自己搞小型的，搞错了不怕，错了就改，最后总是对的。事实就是如此。全专区洼地改造的工程90％以上都是群众自办的。当然，这些工程都不很“正规化”，表面上都很简陋，可是，事实证明，所有的工程，都能发生广泛的效用。沼气池子，原来需要水泥，但用熬硝的卤水掺和胶泥，经证明也能在这里代替水泥用。有了群众性的各种创造，加上国家必要的支持，农村机械化、电气化和化学化的速度，是可以很快的。现在，六行插秧机已试制成功，在南京参加评选，名列第三；播种机制成了；小型拖拉机在今年下半年就可以制成；煤气机原来日产七台，现在二十四台。当然，电气化、机械化的要求也是由初级到高级的过程，目前的要求是：用电力灌溉排水、农副业加工、夜间照明等；机械化方面主要用机器插秧、播种、收获等。这里的党组织和群众的一致认识是：不怕因陋就简，只怕失去了时间。早一年实现电气化、机械化，农村就早一年繁荣起来，国家的社会主义建设就可以早一年完成。
    “叶里藏花”将使  稻种分类起革命
    所有这一切，对于这次来参观的许多科学家们来说，都是未曾想到或虽然想到也不十分明确的。因此，在全体参观者的座谈会上，农业机械工程师李克佐说的“现场看一看，胜读十年书”，大家都有同感。李克佐说：现在亲眼看到广大群众中成长起来的技术力量，看到了产量成几倍地增长，觉得我们国家的“一穷二白”，将要成为历史名词。许多科学家也像他一样，看到了祖国远大的将来。著名的水稻专家、中国农业科学院院长丁颖在参观当中，知道这里的一种粳稻品种叫“叶里藏花”，既能在深水里种，也能在旱地上种，还能在一般水田里种。他说，这是世界水稻科学上了不起的事，有了这个品种，水稻品种分类学将要引起革命。中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所副所长戴松恩说，去年冬天在苏联时，知道苏联大力发展沼气事业，认为我们在这方面还是一张白纸，没想到我们很快已大量开展利用沼气的工作了。
    科学家的作用  有如点豆腐的卤
    面对着这样日新月异的巨大变化，科学家们都感到自己脱离了现实，脱离了群众。李克佐在座谈中说：“在杨柳青农展会上看到群众发明创造的机具，很简单，但效率好，特点是因地制宜，符合当地技术和经济条件。而我们一着手就很复杂，似乎不复杂就不能代表工程技术的‘水平’，脱离了当前的现实条件。光想搞大型的复杂的，办不了，工作就停顿了，这叫做差之毫厘，失之千里。”他还说，总以为搞社会主义建设，只有搞大工厂，大工程，因此就要有多少工程技术人员，多少科学家，这样一算，社会主义建设要许许多多的时间才能实现。现在才更深刻地认识到建设社会主义，主要力量在农民、工人身上。过去似乎认为搞社会主义建设，“离了我不成”。没有看到群众的伟大力量。其实，科学家的作用，只不过像点豆腐的卤一样，群众创造各种经验，科学家加些卤子进去就能成为豆腐。电力设计院范炽夫认为，科学家们过去是“迈方步，四平八稳慢慢走”，和群众的想法作法完全两样。原来认为已经是对农村的设计，现在看来，还是十分落后于群众的创造才能的。群众大跃进，自己则落后了。
    为什么会脱离现实、脱离群众？科学家们接触到了思想深处。范炽夫说得好，他说，知识分子与群众的关系不深，主要是知识分子站在群众外边，总认为对群众是“我给你”，像耶稣一样。他举例子说，有位技术人员设计一个工程，群众嫌浪费，要求减低工料，这位技术人员说：“你可以减，坏了你负责，我不负责。”范炽夫认为，这个例子说明知识分子这么一种思想：跃进是群众的事，我能成名有利我就跃进，不能就站在旁边。西北交通大学教授顾乾贞认为农民所以能创造，是因为他们在做自己的事。如果科学家们把群众的事当做自己的事，也同样能够创造。华南农学院教授谢申说，没有共产主义的自觉，就没有创造性的劳动。经过这次参观，科学家们都表示要到群众当中去，老老实实地当群众的学生。许多人表示要争取达到又红又专，认为天津地委书记赵克同志就是又红又专的榜样。（附图片）
