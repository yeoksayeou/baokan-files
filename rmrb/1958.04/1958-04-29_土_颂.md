    Ode to "Earth"
    Chi Liuzhou
    Opening the recent newspapers, I see that many good creations of the masses are prefixed with the word "earth": "earth methods," "earth cement," "earth automobiles," etc., which can't help but evoke some thoughts. In the past, when people used the word "earth" to describe things, it often carried a sense of contempt and ridicule. "Earth head, earth brain," "earthy," "country bumpkin," etc., were not said out of respect, and those who heard them seemed to feel insulted. But today we use "earth" to praise the wisdom and creativity of the masses. Isn't this a revolution in the meaning of "earth"!
    When the use of "earth" to express ridicule and contempt began is unknown. But judging from its opposite, the word "foreign," it can be said that it was most intense when the foreign style was prevalent. In the old, semi-colonial China, some people who had completely lost their national self-esteem worshiped the material civilization and spiritual culture of imperialism, even to the point of thinking the foreign moon was better. In that era, everything native was bound to be ridiculed, despised, and rejected. Therefore, the contempt for "earth" things is essentially a reflection of comprador ideology, or at least a kind of national nihilistic thinking.
    After liberation, some dogmatists who were divorced from reality also looked down on the fresh and lively creations of the masses. According to their theories, since rural mechanization and electrification were to be realized, the state would have to build more tractor factories, automobile factories, and power stations; since agricultural tools and transportation vehicles were to be designed, they must be very modern and standardized; otherwise, one would have to wait, and wait for a long time. The creations of the masses? "Earthy," "unscientific," "irregular," and "unmodern" were naturally out of the question.
    But we believe that these native creations that have recently emerged have profound revolutionary significance: first, they solve some of the contradictions in the current Great Leap Forward in production; second, they are the germination of China's technological revolution, the bridge and quantitative stage for realizing mechanization, electrification, and chemicalization; and third, they promote the transformation and leap forward of the superstructure. In addition, there is another extremely important significance, that is, they indicate a new upsurge in the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. "Earth cement," "earth automobiles," and other large numbers of "earth creations" are manifestations of the revolutionary spirit of the masses and the high tide of socialist enthusiasm in socialist construction and the struggle against nature. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly taught us that we should cherish any small socialist enthusiasm of the masses, and should share the same breath and destiny with the masses, and not frustrate their enthusiasm. Moreover, now the enthusiasm of the masses is no longer small or sporadic, but has become a prairie fire.
    Of course, our cherishing and praising of these "earth" creations of the masses does not mean that, like Ah Q, we dislike those modern and advanced things. No, today's support, promotion, and praise of "earth" things is precisely in order to surpass and negate them tomorrow (some will be preserved forever, and even in communist society, manual labor cannot be completely eliminated), and to reach a completely modern and advanced stage. Nor do we guarantee that every creation of the masses has great significance and effect. The question is how we should view them, and how to liberate our own thinking from old stereotypes and open up the way forward for the young shoots of new things.

### “土”颂

    “土”颂
    迟蓼洲
    翻开最近的报纸，看到群众许多好的创造，都被冠上一个“土”字，“土办法”、“土水泥”、“土汽车”等等，不禁有所感触。因为过去人们用“土”字形容事物的时候，大抵都含有一种轻蔑嘲笑的意味。“土头土脑”、“土里土气”、“土包子”等等，说的人并非出自恭敬，听的人似乎也觉得受了讥讽。而今天我们用“土”来歌颂群众的智慧和创造，这岂不是“土”的含义的一个革命！
    用“土”来表示嘲讽和轻视，始于何时，不得而知。但从他的对立面“洋”字来看，可以肯定以洋风盛行的时候为最烈。在殖民地半殖民地的旧中国，一些丧尽民族自尊心的人，对帝国主义的物质文明和精神文化，崇拜得五体投地，连月亮都是外国的好，在那个时代，一切土生土长的东西，都必然要受到嘲笑、轻蔑和排斥。所以轻视“土”的东西，实质上是买办思想，或者至少也是民族虚无主义思想的一种反映。
    解放以后，有些脱离实际的教条主义者也看不起群众的新鲜活泼的创造，按照他们的理论，既然要实现农村的机械化、电气化，就只好由国家多盖拖拉机厂、汽车厂、发电站；既然要设计农具、运输工具，就必须十分现代化、正规化；否则，只好等待，长时间的等待。群众的创造嘛，“土里土气”、“不科学”、“不正规”、“不现代化”，自然不在话下。
    但是我们认为最近出现的这些土生土长的创造，有十分深刻的革命意义：第一，解决了当前生产大跃进中的一些矛盾；第二，是我国技术革命的萌芽，是实现机械化、电气化、化学化的桥梁和量变阶段；第三，推动了上层建筑的变革和跃进。此外，还有一个极重要的意义，就是它们表明了群众革命积极性的新的高涨。“土水泥”、“土汽车”等大量的“土创造”，是社会主义建设、与自然作斗争中群众革命化、社会主义积极性高涨的表现。党中央和毛主席都一再教导我们，应当珍惜群众的任何一点微小的社会主义积极性，应当同群众同呼吸、共命运，而不要去挫折他们的积极性。何况现在群众的积极性已不是微小的，星星点点的，而已经成了燎原之火呢。
    自然，我们珍惜、歌颂群众这些“土”的创造，并不是像阿Q一样，不喜欢那些现代化的高级的东西。不，今天扶植、提倡、歌颂“土”的东西，正是为了要在明天跨过、否定它们（有一些则是一直要保存下去的，即使在共产主义社会，也不能完全没有手工劳动），达到完全现代化的、高级的阶段。我们也不是担保说群众的这些创造，每一件都具有伟大的意义和作用。问题是我们应该怎样看待它们，怎样使自己的思想从陈旧的套子里解放出来，为新事物的幼芽打开前进的道路。
