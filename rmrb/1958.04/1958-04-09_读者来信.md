Reader's Letters

    Purchasing Equipment in Installments
    Many newly built factories, when purchasing equipment, often buy all the equipment required according to the design specifications at once. The advantage of this approach is that it can guarantee the needs of engineering and production. However, it also has disadvantages, namely that newly built factories cannot install all the equipment and put it all into production in a short period, leaving some equipment, especially auxiliary equipment, power equipment, and repair equipment, idle. This causes a backlog of funds and affects the needs of other factories and mines. Taking the First Automobile Works as an example: it purchased eight air compressors at once, but only used four of them in the five years since the factory was built. Of the ten gas generators, only four have been used.
    I suggest that newly built factories and mines abolish the practice of purchasing all equipment required according to the design specifications at once and implement phased equipment procurement.

    Manufacture More Parts
    I work in equipment management and procurement and often see that when parts of some equipment are broken, they have to be scrapped because suitable replacements cannot be bought. For example, the quick-heating electric soldering iron produced by Shanghai Zhongxing Factory costs thirty yuan and only comes with one copper tip. Once the copper tip is used up, it cannot be bought anywhere. A very good quick-heating electric soldering iron is scrapped just because it lacks a copper tip. I hope that relevant factories will manufacture more parts for sale on the market.

    分期买设备
    许多新建工厂在购置设备时，往往按照设计要求，一次把全部设备购买齐全。这种做法的好处是可以保证工程和生产上的需要。但也有缺点，就是新建厂在短时期内不能把全部设备安装完毕，不能全部投入生产，使得某些设备，尤其是辅助设备、动力设备和机修设备闲置着。因而造成资金积压，并影响其他厂矿的需要。以第一汽车制造厂为例：一次购置了八台空气压缩机，建厂五年来，才用了四台。有十台煤气发生炉，仅用了四台。
    我建议各新建厂矿废除按照设计要求一气把全部设备购买齐全的惯例，实行分期采购设备。

    多制造零件
    我是做器材管理和采购工作的，经常看见一些器材的零件坏了，因买不到适合的配上去，不得不报废。如上海中兴工厂出产的快热电烙铁，价值三十元，只附带一个铜头，铜头用完之后，到处买不到。很好的一个快热电烙铁，就因为缺一个铜头报废了。我希望各有关工厂多制造一些零件在市场上销售。
