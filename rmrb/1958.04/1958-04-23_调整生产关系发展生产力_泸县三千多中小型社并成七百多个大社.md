Adjusting Production Relations to Develop Productive Forces
    Luxian Merges Over Three Thousand Small and Medium-Sized Communes into Over Seven Hundred Large Communes

(Our report) Luxian County, Sichuan Province, in order to adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, merged the county's more than three thousand small and medium-sized agricultural cooperatives into more than seven hundred large cooperatives before the spring plowing. The average size of these cooperatives is about two hundred and fifty households. After the merger, the manpower and material resources of each agricultural cooperative have been greatly enhanced, the level of management has also been significantly improved, and the labor enthusiasm of the peasant masses has been unprecedentedly high.

The merger of cooperatives in Luxian County was carried out during the high tide of the winter production campaign. At that time, the situation was: the tasks of building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and improving soil were very heavy, but the average of each agricultural cooperative in the county was only more than sixty households, and both manpower and material resources were felt to be insufficient; in terms of land, the scattered distribution of small cooperatives made it inconvenient for unified planning; in particular, the leadership backbone of many agricultural cooperatives was weak, and the financial system was chaotic, seriously hindering the development of production. The broad masses of peasants have asked to merge small cooperatives into large cooperatives. The Luxian County Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed and studied this situation, decided to support the demands of the masses, take revolutionary measures, and carry out the work of merging cooperatives in a thorough and meticulous manner. After organizing the broad masses of members to discuss the issue of merging cooperatives and unify their understanding, under the leadership of local Party organizations, basically with the village as the unit, each small cooperative, according to its own cadre conditions and natural conditions, and on the basis of mutual voluntariness, formed a preparatory committee for the joint establishment of a large cooperative in the vicinity. While leading production, they also organized members to deliberate and elect the leading body of the large cooperative, and formally merged the cooperatives.

In the process of merging cooperatives, specific issues such as this year's summer harvest distribution and public accumulation were also resolved properly in the spirit of socialism: the summer harvest crops are generally distributed uniformly by the large cooperative, while taking into account the amount, quality, and last year's grain retention level of each small cooperative's summer harvest crops. For the public accumulation funds of each small cooperative, those before 1956 were transferred to the large cooperative according to the amount; for those in 1957, the cooperative with more public accumulation funds was taken as the standard, and the cooperative with less was supplemented to this standard. The members are very satisfied.

Practice has proved that the merger of cooperatives has played a positive role in promoting agricultural production in the county. Taking the construction of water conservancy as an example, in the small cooperative period, the progress of general projects was slow and the scale was small, with an average irrigation area of only seventy mu per place; after the merger into large cooperatives, not only did the project progress accelerate, but the irrigation area also expanded to an average of more than four hundred and eighty mu per place. Large cooperatives are also conducive to the rational use of cultivated land. Due to the large area of cultivated land, each agricultural cooperative has sufficient convenience to plant crops according to local conditions. The merger of cooperatives also provides a more abundant labor force for the current spring plowing production. The county's more than 600,000 mu of early rice was transplanted one month earlier than last year.

Based on the principle of the strong leading the weak, unity and mutual assistance, special attention was paid to the selection of leadership backbone for large cooperatives in the work of merging cooperatives. Now, the directors of each agricultural cooperative are all selected by the masses from the directors of the original small cooperatives. With the exception of a very few incompetent personnel, the directors of the original small cooperatives generally still serve as production team leaders of the large cooperatives in their original places. After the leadership backbone was strengthened, the three types of cooperatives, which originally accounted for about 10% of the total number of cooperatives in the county, no longer exist. The financial chaos that has long existed in the county's agricultural cooperatives has also been resolved after the merger due to the increased strength of the cadres. At present, most agricultural cooperatives have achieved daily clearing and monthly settlements, and publicize their accounts on time. Now most agricultural cooperatives have implemented the advanced quota system of "calculating work based on output," and more than two-thirds of the cooperatives have formulated democratic conventions and reward and punishment systems, which greatly improves the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of members.

    调整生产关系发展生产力
    泸县三千多中小型社并成七百多个大社
    本报讯　四川省泸县适应生产大跃进的需要，在春耕前夕把全县三千多个中、小型农业社合并成七百多个大社，这些社的规模平均在二百五十户左右。并社以后，各农业社的人力物力大大增强，经营管理水平也显著提高，农民群众的劳动热情空前高涨。
    泸县的并社工作是在冬季生产运动的高潮中进行的。当时的情况是：兴修水利、积造肥料和改良土壤的任务很大，而全县平均每个农业社只有六十多户，人力物力都感不足；在土地方面，也由于小社分布零散，不便统一规划；特别是不少农业社领导骨干薄弱，财务制度混乱，严重地阻碍着生产的发展。广大农民纷纷要求并小社为大社。中共泸县县委分析研究了这一情况，决定支持群众的要求，采取革命措施，深入细致地进行并社工作。在组织广大社员讨论并社问题统一认识之后，随即在各地党组织的领导下，基本上以村为单位，由各小社按照本身的干部条件和自然条件，根据双方自愿，就近联合组成大社的筹备委员会，一面领导生产，一面组织社员酝酿选出大社的领导机构，正式并社。
    在并社过程中，对于今年夏收分配和公共积累等具体问题，也本着社会主义精神协商出妥善的解决办法：夏收作物一般由大社统一分配，同时按各小社夏收作物的多、少、好、坏和去年的留粮水平，适当予以照顾。各小社的公积金，1956年以前的，按数移交大社；1957年的，则以公积金较多的社为标准，提留较少的社照此标准补足。社员都很满意。
    实践证明，并社对于全县的农业生产起了积极的促进作用。以兴修水利为例，在小社时期，一般工程进度迟缓，规模不大，平均每处灌溉面积只有七十亩；并成大社以后，不仅工程进度加快，灌溉面积也扩大到每处平均四百八十多亩。大社还有利于合理使用耕地。由于耕地面积大，各农业社有了充分的便利来因地制宜地种植作物。并社还给当前的春耕生产提供了更加充足的劳动力。全县六十多万亩早稻，比去年提早一个月栽插完毕。
    根据以强带弱、团结互助的原则，各地在并社工作中特别注意了大社领导骨干的人选问题。现在，各农业社的主任都是群众从原来各小社的主任中选拔出来的。除了少数极不称职的人员以外，原来小社的主任一般仍在原地担任大社的生产队长。领导骨干加强后，原来全县占总社数10％左右的三类社已不复存在了。长期以来在全县农业社里存在的财务混乱问题，也由于干部力量增强而在并社后得到了解决。目前各农业社大都做到日清月结，按期公布账目。现在绝大部分农业社都实行了“以产计工”的先进定额制度，有三分之二以上的社制订了民主公约和奖惩制度，广大社员的劳动积极性大为提高。
