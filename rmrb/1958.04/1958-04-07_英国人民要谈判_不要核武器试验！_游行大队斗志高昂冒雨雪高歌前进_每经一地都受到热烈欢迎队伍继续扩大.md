Xinhua News Agency, London, April 5th (By our correspondent Qian Hang): People participating in the Easter "Ban the Bomb" march from London to Aldermaston are pressing forward today despite the adverse weather.

The marchers are experiencing the coldest and most severe Easter weather in Britain in forty-one years. It snowed in the morning, then turned to hail, and heavy rain fell in the afternoon. The marchers' clothes and banners were soaked, but they sang in unison, "One, two, three, four, we say no to war; five, six, seven, eight, we say negotiate," and advanced with high morale, holding up large signs that read "Negotiations, not (nuclear weapon) tests." The procession stretched for two miles.

People from almost every stratum of society are participating in the march: trade unions, student organizations, peace committees, religious institutions, communists, liberals, and people of other political persuasions, showing that opposition to nuclear weapons has transcended the boundaries of parties and ideologies.

One of the most moving scenes during the march was a man pushing a wheelchair with a child in it, and a woman pushing her one-and-a-half-year-old baby in a stroller, followed by four other children. Bake, a construction worker with a family of eight participating in the march, said, "I am not a person who regularly participates in political processions. But this is a most important matter." He said his whole family did a fourteen-mile walking practice before joining the march.

The marchers were cheered by local residents as they passed through every town and village, and many residents joined the procession.

When the march reached Slough today (the first town in Britain to submit a petition to Parliament opposing the British production of hydrogen bombs), large numbers of residents and members of the local municipal council came out to welcome them in the rain and marched along with the procession. There, Labour MP Fenner Brockway delivered a speech at a mass rally. He said that if Britain and the United States did not follow the Soviet Union's example and stop nuclear weapon tests, they would be guilty. He demanded that Britain stop making hydrogen bombs, destroy its stockpiles, and stop establishing missile bases on British territory. He said that Britain's position should not be used as a base, but should become a mediation center between the Soviet Union and the United States. He said that British lives could be wiped out in a matter of hours in a war. He told the young people in the march, "You must end the crimes our government leaders are committing."

After the marchers arrived at their campsite in Maidenhead tonight, Dr. Donald Soper, who led the team, delivered a speech. He called on Britain to abandon the hydrogen bomb unilaterally, saying, "If it is a good action, then we should do it." He refuted the British ruling group's fallacy of "nuclear deterrence," saying, "I am tired of hearing that the Russians will come and occupy us next week. I have never believed it." He said, "I would rather risk peace, which is morally and intellectually right, than try to save the world in a way that amounts to human suicide and degradation."

The marchers received various forms of care from the local people at the Maidenhead campsite. (Attached photo)

    英国人民要谈判　不要核武器试验！
    游行大队斗志高昂冒雨雪高歌前进
    每经一地都受到热烈欢迎队伍继续扩大
    新华社伦敦5日电　本社记者钱行报道：参加从伦敦到阿尔德马斯顿的复活节“不要氢弹”大游行的人们，今天冒着恶劣的天气前进。
    游行的人们今天遇到了英国四十一年来气候最冷、最恶劣的复活节。上午下雪，后来转为冰雹，下午又下大雨。游行者的衣服和旗帜都淋湿了，但是他们齐声高唱着“一二三四，我们说不要战争；五六七八，我们说要谈判”，高举着“要谈判不要（核武器）试验”的大标语牌，情绪高昂地前进。队伍连绵两英里长。
    在游行队伍中几乎有每一阶层的人民：工会、学生组织、和平委员会、宗教机构、共产党人、自由党人和其他政治信仰的人，表明反对核武器的问题已经超越了政党和思想的界限。
    游行过程最动人中的情景之一是：一个男人推着一个轮椅，其中坐着一个孩子，一个女人用婴儿车推着她一岁半的婴儿，在他们的后面还跟着另外四个孩子。这个全家八口都参加了大游行的建筑工人培克说：“我不是一个经常参加政治性行列的人。但是这次是一个最重要的事情。”他说，他全家在参加游行前举行了十四英里长的步行练习。
    游行队伍路过每一个村镇都受到当地居民的夹道欢呼，许多居民还纷纷参加大队一道前进。
    当游行队伍今天中途到达斯劳（这个市镇是英国第一个向议会提出请愿书、反对英国制造氢弹的市镇）时，大批居民以及当地市政委员会的委员们，都冒雨出来欢迎，并和游行队伍一同行进。在那里，工党议员芬纳·布罗克威在群众集会上发表演说。他说，英美如果不追随苏联的榜样停止核武器试验，就是有罪的。他要求英国停止制造氢弹，销毁储存，并且停止在英国领土上建立火箭基地。他说，英国的地位不应该用来作基地，而应该成为苏美之间的调解中心。他说，在战争中英国的生命能在几小时内被消灭。他对游行队伍中的青年人说，“你们要终止我们的政府领导人正在犯的罪”。
    游行队伍今晚到达宿营地门登海德以后，带队的当纳德·索佩尔博士发表演说。他要求英国单独放弃氢弹，他说：“如果这是好的行动，那么我们就该做”。他驳斥英国统治集团的“核威慑”的谬论说，“我听腻了什么俄国人下星期就要来占领我们的说法。我从来也不相信这话”。他说，“我宁可为了在道德上和理智上都是正确的和平而冒险，也不愿意用那等于是人类的自杀和堕落的方法来企图拯救世界。”
