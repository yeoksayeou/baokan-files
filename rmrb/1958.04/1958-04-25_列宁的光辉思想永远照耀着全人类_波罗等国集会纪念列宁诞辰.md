    Lenin's Brilliant Thought Will Forever Illuminate All Mankind
    Baltic States Hold Gatherings to Commemorate Lenin's Birthday
    Poland
    On the 22nd, a gathering commemorating the 88th anniversary of Lenin's birth was held at the Lenin Metallurgical Combine in Nowa Huta, near Krakow.
    When the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Krakow Provincial Committee, Motyka, delivered the opening speech at the commemoration meeting, he said that the Krakow area was where Lenin once lived, and a living monument of Polish-Soviet friendship has been established here—a metallurgical combine built with the help of Lenin's country.
    Jerzy Morawski, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, said in his speech that Lenin's basic theories are applicable to all countries. He also spoke of the need to be vigilant against the conspiracies of the imperialist bloc and their arms race.
    Romania
    On the afternoon of the 22nd, Bucharest held a commemorative meeting for the 88th anniversary of Lenin's birth.
    Romanian Workers' Party and government leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chivu Stoica, and others attended the commemorative meeting.
    Leonte Răutu, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, gave a report at the meeting. He pointed out that Lenin had fought against opportunism and revisionism to defend the purity of Marxism.
    Răutu believes that the dictatorship of the proletariat is an inevitability of historical development. He pointed out that after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, opportunists and revisionists tried their best to reduce and abandon the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the transition to socialism. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Romanian people could not have achieved such great achievements. Răutu also emphasized the important role of the party's leadership and the state apparatus in socialist construction.
    Răutu then said that our party will make its own contribution to the unity of the socialist camp. It is particularly important now to oppose revisionism.
    Albania
    The Institute of Party History of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian-Soviet Friendship Association held a meeting in Tirana on the afternoon of the 22nd to commemorate the 88th anniversary of Lenin's birth. Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, including Kapo and Mufti, attended the commemorative meeting. Member of the Central Committee of the Labor Party and Vice Chairman of the Albanian-Soviet Friendship Association, ?imi Je Hoja, spoke at the meeting. On the same day, the "People's Voice" published an editorial commemorating Lenin's birthday, which once again emphasized the need to oppose revisionism. The "People's Voice" editorial said that the main danger of the current workers' movement and communist movement is revisionism. It is right-leaning opportunism. The editorial said that in the current struggle against revisionism, the legacy of Lenin's theoretical documents is a very powerful weapon. Whether in the past or now, Lenin's thought is the beacon of our party and our people who are building socialism. The Albanian Labor Party has overcome obstacles and difficulties in the past and achieved great achievements and victories precisely because it has always been guided by Marxism-Leninism.

    列宁的光辉思想永远照耀着全人类
    波罗等国集会纪念列宁诞辰
    波兰
    22日，在克拉科夫附近诺瓦胡塔的列宁冶金联合企业举行了纪念列宁诞生八十八周年的集会。
    波兰统一工人党克拉科夫省委员会第一书记莫蒂卡在纪念会上致开幕词时说，克拉科夫地区是列宁曾经住过的地方，在这里已经建立起波苏友谊的一个活生生的纪念物——在列宁的国家的帮助下建设的冶金联合企业。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员耶·莫拉夫斯基在会上讲话时谈到，列宁的基本理论适用于一切国家。他还谈到了警惕帝国主义集团的阴谋和他们的军备竞赛的必要性。
    罗马尼亚
    22日下午，布加勒斯特举行了列宁诞生八十八周年的纪念大会。
    罗马尼亚工人党和政府领导人乔治乌—德治、基伏·斯托伊卡等出席了纪念会。
    工人党中央政治局候补委员勒昂特·拉乌图在会上作了报告。他指出，列宁曾经为保卫马克思主义的纯洁性同机会主义和修正主义进行了斗争。
    拉乌图认为，无产阶级专政是历史发展的必然性。他指出，在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，机会主义和修正主义极力降低和抛弃在向社会主义过渡时期中无产阶级专政的作用。如果没有无产阶级专政，罗马尼亚人民就不可能取得目前这样大的成就，拉乌图还强调指出了党的领导和国家机器在社会主义建设中的重大作用。
    拉乌图接着说，我们党将为社会主义阵营的团结作出自己的贡献。目前特别重要的是反对修正主义。
    阿尔巴尼亚
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会党史研究所和阿苏友好协会22日下午在地拉那举行纪念列宁诞生八十八周年的大会。出席纪念大会的有劳动党中央政治局委员卡博和穆夫蒂乌等。劳动党中央委员、阿苏友协副主席?奇米叶·霍查在会上讲了话。同一天，“人民之声报”为纪念列宁诞辰发表了一篇社论，这篇社论再一次强调必须反对修正主义。“人民之声报”的社论说，当前工人运动和共产主义运动的主要危险是修正主义。它是右倾的机会主义。社论说，在当前反修正主义的斗争中，列宁理论文献的遗产是非常有力的武器。无论过去和现在，列宁的思想都是我们党和正在建设社会主义的我们人民的明灯。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党过去克服障碍和困难以及取得美好的成绩和胜利，正是因为它经常是以马克思列宁主义为指南的。（新华社）
