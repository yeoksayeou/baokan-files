To the Fetishists
By our reporter Fan Rongkang

The "fetishists" referred to here are those leading cadres and engineering technicians in production who only see the role of capital and equipment, and do not see the role of the masses; those who "see things but not people." Such people exist; even in the current surging revolutionary situation, they still exist. In Zhengzhou, I heard some things about them.

The Zhengzhou city-owned local industry originally planned for a 6.9% increase in the total value of production in 1958 compared to the actual performance in 1957. This speed was obviously conservative. Not only could the urgently needed agricultural machinery such as water pumps required by the agricultural Great Leap Forward not be guaranteed from this plan; but also, according to this plan, the production targets of nearly half of the factories were actually lower than the actual level of last year. The Zhengzhou Municipal Local Industry Party Committee and the Zhengzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry requested the enterprises under their jurisdiction to overcome conservative thinking, fully mobilize the masses, and revise the plan with the revolutionary spirit of the promoting faction. However, some factories put forward a prerequisite: increase investment. In a very short period of time, the Zhengzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry received many reports, totaling more than one million yuan in investment requests. The comrades in these factories said: "A clever woman cannot cook without rice; without increased investment, production cannot be increased." With investment, they also said: "Purchasing equipment and installing machines takes too much time, and it may not have much effect within the year." In short, when they considered increasing production and making a leap forward, they first considered material conditions such as capital and equipment, and did not first see the positive factors of people. As a result, things certainly did not go as they imagined. After several rounds of great battles with conservative thinking, the Zhengzhou Municipal Local Industry formulated a new plan, with the total value of production in 1958 to increase by 128% compared to the actual performance in 1957. From an increase of 6.9% to an increase of 128%, the speed increased by nearly twenty times. Although there are also material factors here, increasing necessary investment and adding necessary equipment, the main, decisive factor is still the human factor, which is the promotion of the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses.

Li Ting, Deputy Secretary of the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee, talked to reporters about another matter. There was a chief engineer of a factory who was very active in his work, but he opposed the slogan of catching up with the advanced, especially the use of this slogan to organize mass movements. The workers in the factory proposed to catch up with Qingdao in product quality within half a year, but he did not agree, saying it was "not safe." People said to him: "Yes, it may not be safe, but this spirit is good, and the direction is right. As for whether it is half a year or a year to catch up, that can be determined according to the specific conditions. You say half a year is not safe, so how many years will it take to catch up?" He was speechless. Why was this chief engineer so negative about catching up with the advanced? It turned out that his views on the leadership methods of industrial production were fundamentally different from the Party's emphasis on politics as the commander and the mass line it advocated. He did not like mass movements, and did not agree with using mobilizing the masses and using movements to solve production problems. That is to say, he did not recognize that politics is the commander, at least he did not recognize that politics is also the commander in industrial production. He felt that production was just production, just burying oneself in the office to study. Such people do not seem to be "fetishists," but in terms of not seeing the power of the masses, they are no different from "fetishists." Comrade Li Ting said: "The thinking of this chief engineer is representative among engineering and technical personnel."

In production, is it the material factor or the human factor that plays a decisive role? Is politics the commander of industry? Is it necessary to use mass movement methods to solve production problems? These are indeed fundamental questions about the leadership methods of industrial production. To solve this problem, it is best to ask the "fetishists" to take some time to go among the masses. You don't have to go far. In Zhengzhou, there are many vivid things that can give the "fetishists" a profound lesson.

The reporter once visited the Zhengzhou Cooperative Oil Factory. This is a small local factory developed from a county-run industry. Although it has been around for about seven years, not many people in society know about it. A tricycle worker asked several places before pulling me to the factory gate. At first glance, it was a dilapidated courtyard from a long time ago, with rows of brick and tile houses interspersed with straw sheds, not at all like a factory. Comrade Zhang Haichao, the secretary of the Party branch, introduced to me the factory's development history over the past seven years. To sum it up in one sentence: The development history of the Zhengzhou Cooperative Oil Factory in the past seven years is the history of picking up scraps. The factory building was bought from this current dilapidated courtyard. The machines, including those purchased when the factory was built and those added after the production development, were all old goods that others did not want. Some were even found by people from piles of scrap copper and iron; needless to say, the machines were old, had poor performance, and low efficiency. There are also some equipment, such as the dragon for transportation and the pipeline for water supply, which were all made by ourselves using bamboo and indigenous methods. To talk about material conditions, this cannot be considered relatively poor. For "fetishists," what can such a mess still accomplish? However, the workers of the Zhengzhou Cooperative Oil Factory used such old, weak, and dilapidated machines to do amazing things, becoming a famous advanced factory in the national oil industry. Their oil yield, quality, and cost indicators are not the most advanced in the country, but their names are among the top few. Now they are full of confidence in organizing a great leap in production, preparing to catch up with the most advanced level in the country within a few months. Why is such a dilapidated factory doing so well and harboring such great ambitions? Comrade Zhang Haichao said very simply: "Our experience is to mobilize the masses, hand over all difficulties to the masses, and let the masses come up with solutions."

Following the mass line is an old saying, but it is truly a panacea. Over the past seven years, how many seemingly unsolvable problems have been solved easily in the hands of the workers! When promoting Li Chuanjiang's soybean oil extraction method, there was no money to buy materials to build a fire pit to soften the soybeans, so the workers used hot soybean cakes to soften the soybeans; there was no money to buy a rotary blank drying pot, so the workers built stoves and used large iron pots to fry them. When promoting the advanced experience of softening soybeans from oil factories in Wuxi and Changzhou, there was no money to purchase water-cooled dragons, so the workers increased the temperature of the kang surface and increased the number of kang turnovers to achieve the same effect. When promoting the experience of improving product quality from the Kaifeng Oil Factory, there was no money to buy a new oil hydration pot, so the workers repaired and patched up unused waste tea stoves to replace them.

Look, how great a role people have played here! "Fetishists," isn't this still worth pondering?

Of course, when we say that people are the most active factor in production, we do not deny the role of things. People's role in production is always realized through machines, tools, and other things. Moreover, it is precisely those leaders who believe that people are the most active factor in production who can most fully estimate the potential of things and maximize the role of things. This is also something that "fetishists" cannot imagine, but cannot but admit. Whether you are willing or not, the "fetishist" way of thinking is metaphysical. They worship machines, but machines in their minds are just some immutable, rigid things. It can produce so many products today, and it can only produce so many products tomorrow. As mentioned above, some local industrial factories in Zhengzhou believe that production can only be increased by increasing equipment. Have the efficiency of the existing equipment in these factories been fully utilized? No, the equipment utilization rate of some factories is even less than 20%. However, the "fetishists" cannot see these. On the contrary, the same machines, the same things, placed in the hands of leaders who believe in people and are good at mobilizing people's wisdom and strength, can exert several times, or even dozens of times, the efficiency. This is the secret of Zhengzhou City's local industry's great leap forward in 1958.

Perhaps the chief engineer mentioned above would say: "I also believe that people's subjective initiative can have a huge impact on matter, but why must we engage in movements?" Regarding this question, I would like to say: Movements were not invented by the Communist Party. Movement is the struggle and unity of contradictions; contradictions exist objectively, and movement also exists objectively. If you don't lead it, don't organize it, it still exists, you can't push it away, you can't avoid it. For example, the movement to catch up with the advanced: long before the birth of the Communist Party, the entire history of social production development was a history of the movement to catch up with the advanced. A few advanced elements created advanced production levels, and then, more and more producers learned from their experience, caught up with their production levels, and the entire social production improved. Isn't this process a process of movement? The Communist Party has only summarized historical experience, and according to the laws of the development of things, organized and led this movement again to promote its faster development. If you still ask: "Isn't it better to let it go naturally? Why must we organize it?" Then, the reason is also very simple: "We are Communists, we are promoters."

### 给拜物教徒

    给拜物教徒
    本报记者　范荣康
    这里说的“拜物教”徒，是那些在生产中只看见资金、设备的作用，看不见群众的作用的“见物不见人”的领导干部和工程技术人员。这样的人是有的；即便在当前澎湃发展的革命形势下，也是有的。在郑州，就听到一些关于他们的事情。
    郑州市的市属地方工业，原来计划1958年的生产总值比1957年实绩增长6.9％。这个速度显然是保守的。不但农业大跃进所迫切需要的水泵等农业机械，不能从这个计划中得到供应的保证；而且按照这个计划，几乎有近半数工厂的生产指标反而低于去年的实际水平。中共郑州市地方工业党委会和郑州市工业局要求所属企业克服保守思想，充分发动群众，用促进派的革命精神来修订计划。然而有些工厂却提出一个先决条件：增加投资。在很短的时间内，郑州市工业局就收到许多报告，总计要求增加投资一百多万元。这些工厂的同志说：“巧妇难为无米之炊，不增加投资不能增产。”有了投资，又说：“购置设备，安装机器太费时间，年内未必能见多少效果。”总之，他们考虑增产、跃进的时候，首先考虑的是资金、设备等物质条件，而没有首先看到人的积极因素。结果，事情当然不像他们想像的那样。经过同保守思想几个回合的大战，郑州市市属地方工业订出了新的规划，1958年的生产总值要比1957年实绩增长128％。从增长6.9％到增长128％，速度提高了近二十倍。这里虽然也有物的因素，增加必要的投资，添置必要的设备，但主要的，起了决定作用的，还是人的因素，是发扬了广大群众的革命干劲。
    中共郑州市委副书记李亭同记者谈到另一件事。有一个工厂的总工程师，工作很积极，可是他反对赶先进的口号，特别反对用这个口号组织群众运动。厂里的工人提出产品质量半年赶上青岛，他不赞成，说是“不保险”。人家对他说：“是的，可能不保险，但这种精神是好的，方针是对的，至于究竟是半年还是一年赶上，那可以根据具体条件来订。你说半年不保险，那么几年能赶上呢？”他就不言语了。为什么这位总工程师对于赶先进如此消极呢？原来他对于工业生产的领导方法的看法，同我们党所强调的政治是统帅，所提倡的群众路线有根本分歧。他不喜欢群众运动，不赞成用发动群众、用运动的方法来解决生产问题。也就是说，他不承认政治是统帅，至少是他不承认在工业生产上政治也是统帅。他觉得生产就是生产，就是埋头在办公室里研究。这样的人好像不是“拜物教”徒，其实拿看不到群众的力量来说，同“拜物教”徒并无二样。李亭同志说：“这位总工程师的思想，在工程技术人员中是有代表性的。”
    在生产中起决定作用的，究竟是物的因素还是人的因素？政治是不是工业的统帅？要不要用群众运动的方法来解决生产问题？这些，确实是工业生产领导方法上的根本性质的问题。解决这个问题，最好还是请“拜物教”徒拿出一些时间到群众中去走走。不必远行，就在郑州，也足有许多生动的事情能给“拜物教”徒上深刻的一课。
    记者曾经访问过郑州合作油厂。这是一个由县营工业发展起来的地方小厂，虽然至今已有七年左右的历史，但在社会上，知道的人还是不多。三轮车工人问了好几个地方，才把我拉到工厂门口。一看，是个年代很久的破院子，几排砖瓦平房中间还搭着些席棚，全不像工厂的模样。党支部书记张海潮同志向我介绍了工厂七年来的发展历史。概括起来就是一句话：七年来郑州合作油厂的发展历史，就是捡破烂的历史。厂房，买的是这个现在的破院子。机器，包括建厂时购买的和生产发展后添置的，全都是别人不要了的旧货，有些还是人家从废铜烂铁堆里找了出来的；机器老，性能差，效率低，那是不用说的。还有一些设备，如运输用的绞龙，供水用的管道，都是自己拿竹子用土办法搞起来的。要谈物的条件，这不能不算比较差的了。对于“拜物教”徒说来，这样一个烂摊子还能有什么作为呢？然而，郑州合作油厂的职工们就用这样一些老弱残破的机器，干出了惊人的事情，在全国油脂工业中成了一个著名的先进厂。他们的出油率、质量和成本指标，在全国虽然不是最先进的，但名字都列在前几名里。现在他们正信心百倍地组织生产大跃进，准备几个月内赶上全国最先进的水平。为什么这样一个破烂的工厂竟搞得这么出色，怀着这么大的抱负呢？张海潮同志说得很朴素：“我们的经验是发动群众，把一切困难交给群众，让群众来想办法。”
    走群众路线，这是老生常谈，但却真是一剂万应灵药。七年来，有多少看来是解决不了的难题，搁在工人手中迎刃而解！推广李川江大豆榨油操作法时，没有钱买材料垒软化大豆的火炕，工人们就用热豆饼来软化大豆；没有钱买回转式烘坯锅，工人们就垒起炉灶用大铁锅炒。在推广无锡和常州的油厂软化大豆的先进经验时，没有钱置水汀绞龙，工人们就加高炕面温度，增加翻炕次数，取得同样的效果。在推广开封油厂提高产品质量的经验时，没有钱买新水化油锅，工人们就把不用的废茶炉修修补补拿来代替。
  请看，人在这里起了多么巨大的作用？“拜物教”徒们，这难道还不值得深思吗？
    当然，我们说人是生产中最积极的因素，并不抹杀物的作用。人对生产的作用，总是通过机器、工具等物来实现的。而且，正是相信人是生产中的最积极因素的那些领导者，才能最充分地估计到物的潜力，最大限度地发挥物的作用。这一点，也是“拜物教”徒料想不到，却又不能不承认的。不管你是否情愿，“拜物教”徒的思想方法都是形而上学的。他们崇拜机器，但机器在他们心目中只不过是一些一成不变的僵死的东西。它今天能生产这么多产品，明天还只能生产这么多产品。上面提到郑州市一些地方工业工厂认为只有增加设备才能增产，难道这些工厂现有设备的效率都已充分发挥了吗？没有，有些厂的设备利用率甚至还不到20％。可是，“拜物教”徒看不见这些。相反地，同样的机器，同样的物，放到相信人、善于发动人的智慧和力量的领导者手中，却能发挥几倍、以至几十倍的效率。郑州市市属地方工业1958年加翻跃进的秘诀就在这里。
    也许上面提到的那位总工程师会说：“我也相信人的主观能动性会对物质发生巨大的影响，可是为什么一定要搞运动呢？”对于这个问题，我想说：运动并不是共产党发明的。运动者，矛盾的斗争及其统一也，矛盾是客观存在的，运动也是客观存在的。你不去领导，不去组织，它本来也存在着，推也推不掉，躲也躲不开。譬如说赶先进的运动吧：远在共产党诞生以前，整个社会生产发展的历史，就是一部赶先进的运动的历史。少数先进分子创造了先进的生产水平，随后，愈来愈多的生产者学习他们的经验，赶上了他们的生产水平，整个社会生产就提高了。这个过程不就是运动的过程吗？共产党只是总结了历史经验，按照事物发展的规律，把这个运动再加以组织、加以领导，促使它更快地发展。如果还要再追问：“听其自然不好吗？为什么一定要加以组织？”那么，理由也很简单：“我们是共产党人，是促进派。”
