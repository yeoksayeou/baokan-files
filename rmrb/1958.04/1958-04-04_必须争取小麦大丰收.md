Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 3rd.
    Currently, the majority of wheat seedlings are reviving and growing, and spring wheat is beginning to be sown in some areas. Farmers everywhere face a major task: to do everything possible to achieve a bumper wheat harvest.
    Wheat production is the first battle on the year's agricultural production front. Whether this battle can be won has a great impact on the overall situation for the year. In the northern provinces, wheat production has always accounted for one-third of the total annual grain production, and in some places, nearly one-half. According to figures gathered at the wheat production promotion conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture in Anguo County, Hebei Province, not long ago, the planned wheat production of eight provinces, including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu, is nearly 50 billion jin, an increase of half over last year. With such a large planned increase, we cannot continue to do things in the old way. We must actively adopt effective measures to increase production and make every effort to tap the potential for increased production.
    At present, the broad masses of farmers have a high degree of enthusiasm for increasing wheat production, and local leading organs are also specifically guiding the masses to strengthen field management of wheat. The current problem is how to make the leadership of wheat production more in-depth and more meticulous. Zhengding County in Hebei Province conducted a comprehensive inspection of all wheat fields in the county, classified and ranked the various wheat fields, and put forward the slogan "Grasp the high-yield fields and eliminate the low-yield fields," leading the county's agricultural cooperatives to launch a production competition centered on striving for a bumper wheat harvest. This method of grasping both ends to drive the middle is worth promoting. The eight provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi have a total of more than 300 million mu of wheat fields. This year, more than 100 million mu have been designated as large-area high-yield wheat fields. At the wheat production promotion conference, the provinces reported an average yield of 290 jin per mu, striving for a yield of 300 jin per mu, for a total of 29 billion jin to 30 billion jin, which would account for more than half of the planned wheat production of the eight provinces. As for low-yield fields, almost every county, every township, and even every cooperative has them. In the past, people rarely invested capital or effort in these fields. Now, with the large increase in water conservancy projects and fertilizers, these wheat fields have the possibility of changing from low-yield to high-yield, so field management must be strengthened.
    In the south, wheat accounts for a smaller proportion than in the north, but it is also an important part of the grain. Although the general cultivation and management are relatively extensive, the potential for increasing production is still great.
    In terms of field management measures, the key to ensuring a bumper wheat harvest in the next month or two is timely topdressing and irrigation. At present, the development of manure accumulation work in provinces (regions) and counties is very uneven. In Anhui Province, the average accumulation of manure per mu of farmland has reached 20,000 jin, and the topdressing of wheat fields has already been settled. However, in some provinces, it is only a few thousand jin per mu, and the topdressing needed for many wheat fields has not yet been settled. Wherever fertilizers are insufficient, we should seize the opportunity to continue to actively accumulate manure. Xushui and other places in Hebei Province have created a rapid-effect compost method, which can compost a large pit of fertilizer in one month. This method can be promoted. In order to make reasonable use of fertilizers, all localities should improve fertilization methods and give full play to the effectiveness of fertilizers.
    Due to the development of water conservancy construction, the irrigated area of wheat fields nationwide is increasing greatly, and a number of "drought and flood insurance" wheat fields have also appeared in various provinces. However, in a few areas, although the number of water conservancy projects has increased a lot, the irrigated area of wheat fields has increased less, either because there are not enough water lifting tools, or because other irrigation preparations have not been done well. These areas should catch up quickly and take effective measures to expand the irrigated area of wheat fields.
    Preventing late frost from harming wheat is currently one of the most important things. In China, in the area north of the Huai River and south of the Great Wall, late frosts often occur every year from "Qingming" to "Guyu". At this time, wheat is in the jointing and heading stage, and its resistance to cold decreases. Once it encounters frost, large numbers often die. Since the beginning of spring this year, some areas have already experienced one or two cold air intrusions. But we cannot say that we will not be affected by frost damage again in the future. Late frosts occurred in the Huaihe River area of ​​Anhui in April of both 1953 and 1954. In Suxian County in this area, late frosts occurred in April seven times in the fifteen years from 1940 to 1954. Therefore, after entering April, frost prevention work cannot be relaxed. An effective way to prevent frost damage is to water before the frost to maintain soil moisture. Although the last late frost in the Huaibei area of ​​Anhui in 1954 was eight days later than the last late frost in 1953, the wheat seedlings were less affected, one of the important reasons was that it rained before the frost in 1954, and the soil was moist. Therefore, meteorological departments at all levels must strengthen temperature drop forecast work, and agricultural production leading departments at all levels must also pay attention to this aspect of the situation and organize the masses to water for frost prevention in a timely manner.
    The southern region will enter the rainy season, so we must strengthen drainage work to prevent scab from occurring. At the same time, we must also prevent wheat from pests. Mai spiders and wheat aphids, which harm wheat seedlings, have been discovered in Fuyang Prefecture of Anhui Province, Suichang, Jingning, Qingyuan counties of Zhejiang Province, and Yingshan and some other areas of Hubei Province. In the more serious areas, the affected area accounts for one-third of the total wheat field area, and the damage rate is 40%. There is still the possibility of wheat sucking pests in many areas. Wheat rust has occurred in a few areas of Zhejiang. The climate has been warm in many areas last winter and this spring, and few overwintering pests have been frozen to death. This means that the possibility of wheat pests occurring this year is greater than in previous years, and there must be no slackness in this regard.
    A large part of the several hundred million mu of wheat that are currently pregnant with ears and reviving were sown in the autumn drought last year. People suffered a lot when sowing, and after sowing, they went through a series of processes such as drought resistance to protect seedlings, topdressing, and watering. Now, if we do not continue to work hard, the previous efforts may be in vain. From a time perspective, there are currently one and a half to two months before the wheat harvest, and there are many things that need to be done. All localities must seize the opportunity to work hard on wheat field management and truly "not stop processing until the wheat harvest begins." Only in this way can we strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year.

### 必须争取小麦大丰收

    必须争取小麦大丰收
    目前多数麦田的麦苗正在返青生长，部分地区的春小麦也开始播种。各地农民面临着一个重大的任务，就是要千方百计地争取小麦大丰收。
    小麦生产是全年农业生产战线上的第一仗。这一仗能不能打胜，对于全年的形势有极大的影响。在北方各省，小麦产量历来都占全年粮食总产量的三分之一，有些地方将近二分之一。据不久以前农业部在河北省安国县召开的小麦增产促进会议上汇集的数字，河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西、甘肃等八省的小麦计划产量将近五百亿斤，比去年增产一半。计划增产的幅度这样大，那就不能照老样子办事，必须积极采取有效的增产措施，尽一切努力挖掘增产潜力。
    现在广大农民争取小麦增产的积极性很高，各地领导机关也在具体地指导群众加强小麦田间管理。当前的问题，是如何使小麦生产的领导更深入，更细致。河北省正定县对全县麦田进行了一次全面大检查，把各样麦田分类排队，提出“抓住丰产田，消灭低产田”的口号，领导全县农业合作社展开了以争取小麦丰收为中心的生产竞赛。这种抓两头带中间的方法值得推广。河北、河南、山东、山西、陕西等八省共有麦田三亿多亩，今年确定的大面积小麦丰产田共有一亿多亩，小麦生产促进会议上各省报告平均每亩产量达到二百九十斤，争取亩产三百斤，总共二百九十亿斤到三百亿斤，这就达到了八省小麦计划产量一半以上。至于低产田，差不多每个县、每个乡以至每个社都有。过去人们很少在这些田地里下本钱、下工夫。现在水利工程和肥料大量增加，使得这类麦田有了由低产变丰产的可能，这就必须抓紧田间管理。
    在南方，小麦比重比北方小，但也是粮食中重要的一项。虽然一般栽培和管理比较粗放，但是增产潜力还很大。
    就田间管理的措施来说，今后一两个月保证小麦丰收的关键，是适时追肥和灌溉。现在各省（区）各县的积肥工作发展很不平衡，安徽省全部农田平均每亩已积肥两万斤，麦田追肥已经有了着落，但是有些省每亩还只有几千斤，不少麦田所需要的追肥还没有着落。凡是肥料不充足的地方，都应当抓紧时机继续积极积肥。河北省徐水等地创造了速效沤肥法，一个月可以沤一大坑肥料，这办法可以推广。为了合理地利用肥料，各地应当改善施肥方法，充分发挥肥效。
    由于水利建设的发展，全国麦田灌溉面积正在大量增加，各省还出现了一批“旱涝双保险”的麦田。可是也有少数地区，虽然水利工程增加了很多，但麦田灌溉面积却增加得较少，原因或者是提水工具不足，或者是其他灌溉准备没有做好。这些地区应当急起直追，赶快采取有效办法扩大麦田灌溉面积。
    防止晚霜危害小麦，是当前一项最重要的事情。我国淮河以北、长城以南地区，每年“清明”到“谷雨”期间常有晚霜发生。这时小麦正处在拔节抽穗阶段，抗寒力减退，一遇霜冻，往往大批死掉。今年入春以来，有些地区已经经历了一两次冷空气的侵袭。但还不能说以后就不会再受冻害。安徽淮北地区1953、1954两年的4月间都曾发生晚霜。这个地区的宿县在1940到1954十五年当中，在4月间发生晚霜的有七次。因此在进入4月以后，防冻工作还是松懈不得。防止霜害的一个有效办法，是霜冻以前浇水，保持土壤湿度。安徽淮北地区1954年最后一次晚霜虽比1953年最后一次晚霜迟八天，但是麦苗受害反较轻，重要原因之一就是1954年霜前下了雨，土壤湿。因此各级气象部门必须加强降温预报工作，各级农业生产领导部门也必须注意这一方面的情况，及时组织群众浇水防冻。
    南方地区将进入阴雨季节，要加强排水工作，防止赤霉病发生。同时还要防止小麦发生虫害。安徽阜阳专区，浙江遂昌、景宁、庆元等县和湖北应山等一些地区，都先后发现危害麦苗的麦蜘蛛、麦蚜虫等。比较严重的地区，发生面积占到麦田总面积三分之一，被害率有40％。不少地区的吸浆虫仍有发生的可能。浙江少数地区已发生了小麦的锈病。许多地区去冬今春气候温暖，越冬害虫冻死很少。这就是说，今年小麦虫害发生的可能比往年大，在这方面不能有丝毫的麻痹。
    现在正在孕穗、返青的几亿亩小麦，有很大一部分是在去年秋季旱灾中播种的。播种时人们吃了很多苦，播种后又经过抗旱保苗、追肥、浇水等一系列的加工。现在如果不继续抓紧努力，以前的努力就有白费的可能。从时间上看，目前距离麦收还有一个半月到两个月的时间，需要做的事情很多。各地必须抓紧时机，在小麦田间管理上狠狠加一把劲，切实作到“麦收不开始，加工不停止”。只有这样，才能争得今年小麦的大丰收。
