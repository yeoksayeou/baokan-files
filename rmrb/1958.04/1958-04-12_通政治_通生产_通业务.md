    Proficient in Politics, Proficient in Production, Proficient in Business
    The Chinese Communist Party沁县 (Qìn xiàn) Committee
    Editor's Note: Qìn xiàn County has done a very good job in finance and trade. Based on the new situation and tasks, they have corrected their business ideology and service orientation, which has not only promoted agricultural production but also developed their own business. We recommend this summary by the Qìn xiàn County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for the reference of leading comrades of various counties and comrades working in the finance and trade system.
    After agricultural cooperativization, a contradiction arose in Qìn xiàn County where the finance and trade work could not keep up with the needs of agriculture. For example, agriculture needed some simple small machinery and new-style farm tools, but the finance and trade departments could not supply them, or the goods arrived out of season, becoming a "post-event cannon." Agricultural cooperatives needed cheap and durable means of production and means of livelihood, but the finance and trade departments procured expensive goods. The county's joint factory had self-made small steel grinders that were of good quality and low price, but the supply and marketing cooperative bought a batch of steel grinders from Tianjin that were expensive and unsuitable, and they could not sell them. Farmers needed beautiful, durable, and cheap cloth, but the textile company imported large quantities of silk and high-priced cloth that farmers could not afford. A large number of local specialties in rural areas were either picked and chosen and priced down by the purchasing departments, or the farmers did not have time to transport them. As a result, farmers could not increase their purchasing power, and the purchasing departments could not receive goods.
    With the advent of the upsurge in agricultural production, this contradiction became more acute. For example, when the Yíngchūn Reservoir was built last year, a lot of equipment such as angle steel, blasting rods, and cement was needed; however, the hardware, electrical appliance, and material department of the Qìn xiàn Department Store only operated more than 500 kinds of goods, and most of them were not needed for water conservancy construction. Therefore, buying this back today and lacking that tomorrow, the work was very passive. At the same time, in recent years, due to the slow development of diversified economic production, the income of the masses is still relatively low. To develop diversified economic production, it is necessary to solve a series of problems such as funds, raw materials, product sales, and technical guidance. To solve these problems, finance and trade work must also quickly catch up.
    Under these circumstances, the county party committee corrected the view of isolated agricultural development and took up finance and trade work.
    Politics Takes Command
    The county party committee first strengthened political and ideological work, with the county party secretary and county head in charge, rectified the finance and trade work team, reversed the service direction, and corrected the business ideology. The policy of the finance and trade system was determined as: facing production, facing the masses, breaking commercial conventions, and everything for the workers and peasants.
    The new policy was not accustomed to those who buried themselves in business and pursued profits, so it immediately caused a strong reaction in the finance and trade system. Some people said: "We often say that commerce serves workers, peasants, and production. Who will serve commerce?" Some people said: "Three meals a day, standing at the counter after eating, doing the math if there is a sale, chatting idly if there is no sale; buying, selling, stocking, transferring, and earning is the duty of commerce!" Some people said: Agricultural production is the business of the party committee and agricultural departments, and has nothing to do with commercial departments. When the construction of the Yíngchūn Reservoir began, and the county party committee decided to appoint Lì Quántáng, deputy manager of the county department store, to be responsible for the supply of reservoir equipment, most of the cadres of the company believed that this was "not doing their job properly," and it was only beneficial to agriculture and not to themselves.
    Therefore, the county party committee raised three questions and organized three major debates in the finance and trade system: (1) Is supporting agricultural production a political issue? (2) Is supporting farmland water conservancy construction a proper job? (3) Is supporting agricultural production a benefit to one side or both sides? Using these three questions, a battlefield for the struggle between socialism and capitalism was laid out in the finance and trade system, and two ideologies launched a fierce struggle. Some people said: "Since ancient times, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants each manage their own line. Commerce is doing business for the sake of making money." Some people said: "The society eats and uses, only I manage the business. If he doesn't come to buy, let him go, why bother going up the mountain to supply!" Some people said: "Money and banknotes are the main road for finance and trade work." However, the facts are the most eloquent. The comrades of the pharmaceutical company said: "If we can't buy back medicinal materials, the pharmaceutical factory will have to stop work, and our company will have no business, let alone treat diseases and save lives." Wáng Jùnlín of the department store said: "If we don't support production, there will be nothing for production, and it will be impossible to develop. If production does not develop, the farmers will have no money, and it will be useless for you to reduce prices and lose money. At that time, we will not only be unable to develop, but also have to close our doors and have no way to go!" Old shop assistant Wáng Chāngxiǎo said: "Supporting industry and agriculture is a win-win-win. If agriculture develops, the farmers will have money, and our sales will be large. If industry develops, we will have sources of goods. If we support industry and agriculture, industry and agriculture will lift us up, which is the greatest advantage of socialism." After more than a month of ideological debate, socialist business ideology occupied the position, shattered the "business theory," people's thoughts were unified, their awareness was raised, and they understood from the bottom of their hearts the policy put forward by the county party committee, clarified the relationship between finance and trade work and agriculture and industry, and clarified the role of commerce in socialist construction. People said: "In the past, we shouted to buy and sell all day long, but we didn't know why. We only knew how to make money, and we couldn't even find the reason for the loss. It turns out that there is a lot of potential in this!"
    Participate in Production, Become Familiar with Production
    Before 1957, the cadres of the Qìn xiàn finance and trade system had a saying: "Ignoring everything outside the window, focusing on being a businessman." This fully reflects the weak political atmosphere and lack of understanding of policies in the finance and trade system. For example, when purchasing agent Yáng Lài was collecting pigs in Qiáocūn, he insisted on estimating an 87-斤 (jīn) pig as 74 斤 (jīn). When the pig farmer disagreed, he drove the pig away. An old man from Yáng'ān drove a pig to the Gùxiànzhèn collection station, but the station either picked and chose or was "off work" and did not work, causing the old man to drive back and forth four times, covering a total of 400 miles. He said angrily: "We will never raise pigs again for generations." As a result, many fat pigs flowed out, but the county could not collect them. In addition, in recent years, the personnel changes have been relatively large, and they are unwilling to study, so many cadres are not proficient in business. For example, the manager and accountant of the pharmaceutical company, after working for more than two years, could not name two kinds of medicinal materials. This situation was almost common throughout the finance and trade system.
    The reason for this situation, in addition to political reasons, is also a very important reason that finance and trade workers have long been separated from production and reality. For this reason, the county party committee put forward the slogan that every finance and trade cadre must learn three sets of skills, namely: "Proficient in Politics, Proficient in Production, Proficient in Business," and at the same time, systematically organized the staff of the finance and trade department to participate in the labor of joint processing plants and farmland water conservancy construction. In the past year, only more than 400 county-level finance and trade workers have done more than 5,800 labor days. In addition, they also participated in the short-distance transportation, loading, unloading, bundling, turning warehouses, and pouring inventories of goods within the enterprise. The food bureau alone reduced the number of porters by 13, saving the country more than 4,300 yuan.
    Directly participating in productive labor not only strengthened agricultural and commercial relations and saved expenses, but also expanded business and enabled finance and trade cadres to embark on the road of being "both red and expert." For example, cadres and salesmen of the department store participated in drought resistance and water conservancy construction, digging soil with small hoes and carrying soil with baskets, but the labor results were not great and it was tiring. So, they discussed: "Can't we purchase and supply iron picks, iron shovels, and hammers? Can't we import some flatbed carts? Can't we import small mine cars and small iron rails?" As soon as the question was raised, some comrades said: "It's not that we can't, but we don't know because we are locked at home. Now we know the role of commerce in production." When the foundation of the reservoir began to be dug, it was the cold October, and the depth to be dug was more than two meters, but there was water after digging less than one meter. How can many people stand working in the water? After research, they came up with this method: "Wear cloth shoes to carry soil, wear short-waisted rubber shoes to shovel mud, wear long-waisted rubber shoes to enter shallow water, and wear rubber pants to enter deep water." After coming up with a solution, they immediately sent people to Taiyuan to buy these goods and promptly supplied more than 400 pieces of long and short-waisted rubber shoes and rubber pants. If you don't go deep into reality, how can you understand it so specifically? Lì Quántáng, the deputy manager of this company, is such a person who participates in labor and studies production, and knows what is needed in agricultural production and water conservancy construction. In the company, people call him "Agricultural Goods Expert"; on all water conservancy construction sites in the county, migrant workers and cadres affectionately call him "Supply Section Chief." In 1957, the department store added more than 1,400 kinds of production and living materials, accounting for 64% of the original types of goods. It really supplied whatever was needed and had whatever was needed, and was praised by the farmers as "younger brother of Wàn Bǎoquán" (the county joint processing plant was praised by the farmers as "Wàn Bǎoquán").
    What to Operate, What Production to Cultivate, What Labor to Participate in, What Experimental Fields to Run
    This is an important method for training "three-proficient" cadres. For example, in order to cultivate livestock production, the supply and marketing cooperative, in conjunction with the bank, jointly established a superior livestock farm with the Nányújiāo agricultural cooperative. Now it has more than 40 superior livestock such as Dutch cattle, Mongolian horses, and Yúlín mares, and plans to increase it to 60 this year. In order to promote chemical fertilizers and master the use of various chemical fertilizers, last year, 21 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives combined with agricultural cooperatives to personally use chemical fertilizers to plant experimental fields of various crops, and achieved high yields. Because they mastered the performance and use technology of various chemical fertilizers through experimental fields, the promotion work of chemical fertilizers in 1957 was very smooth, expanding by 48% compared with 1956.
    The above method has been further developed this year. Various finance and trade units, under the slogan of finding sources of goods for themselves, finding raw materials for industry, and opening up financial resources for the masses to be "living gods of wealth" for the masses, are taking various forms to go to production and engage in experimental fields.
    The supply and marketing cooperative has launched a "five-raising and one-planting" movement throughout the county. Namely: raising pigs, raising rabbits, raising bees, raising chickens, raising livestock, and growing vegetables. Now they have jointly established a Leghorn chicken breeding farm with the Chángshèngxiāng agricultural cooperative, a purebred pig farm with the Chuāngōu agricultural cooperative, and a rabbit farm with the Shíhòu agricultural cooperative, and established vegetable bases through pre-purchase contracts. In addition, in order to adapt to the development needs of diversified economic production, they plan to take forms such as self-operated, industry-commerce joint ventures, and commerce-agriculture joint ventures to establish more than ten small factories such as papermaking, sugar making, and fruit processing in 1958.
    The pharmaceutical company has formulated a production plan to help agricultural cooperatives plant seven kinds of valuable medicinal materials such as codonopsis and rehmannia, and requires that Qìn xiàn County become a county with 10,000 mu of medicinal materials within two years. Now it has trained technicians and purchased most of the seeds. After the plan is realized, it will increase the income of the masses by more than 1.6 million yuan each year.
    In 1958, in addition to technically helping agricultural cooperatives to fully realize four-free granaries, the grain department will also combine with agricultural cooperatives to use all vacant land to plant 25,000 mu of oil crops such as peanuts and sunflowers, with an estimated output of 3.4 million 斤 (jīn).
    In addition to combining with the supply and marketing cooperative to support superior livestock farms, the bank will take Chángshèngxiāng as an experimental field to support the realization of a 10,000-pig township and a purebred pig cooperative.
    The timber company signed a production contract with the Chéngguān agricultural cooperative to cultivate nurseries.
    The accountants of the finance and trade system, in order to go deep into reality and link up with agricultural production, also put forward the slogan of "jumping out of the office, providing door-to-door guidance, doing a good job in the three clearing cooperatives (clearing accounts, clearing funds, and clearing property), and supporting the great leap forward in agriculture." The 94 accountants in the county's finance and trade department adopted the method of building stations at key points and building networks in townships to provide contracted guidance to 152 agricultural cooperatives with unclear accounts. This not only has an important role in consolidating agricultural cooperatives, but also allows for investigation and research through accounting guidance work.
    In short, the finance and trade departments of Qìn xiàn County, through the method of "what to operate, what production to cultivate, what labor to participate in, and what experimental fields to run," have entered agricultural production, not only trained cadres and gained production experience, but also strengthened ties with the masses; not only cultivated diversified economic production and opened up financial resources for the masses, but also expanded their own business. After the above plans are realized, each farmer will increase his cash income by more than 110 yuan, which will be a major contribution to supporting agricultural production.
    Organize Comprehensive Collaboration
    The county party committee divided the county into seven fronts: agriculture, forestry, water, animal husbandry, industry, commerce, culture, and health. Each front has a secretary in charge, and the tasks of each front at each stage are centered on production, and the party committee makes unified arrangements and unified inspections, and each front guarantees completion. For example, in supporting farmland water conservancy construction, the task given to the commercial department by the county party committee was: "Try every possible means to find sources of goods, and the supply work should be at the forefront." The task given in the development of diversified economy is: "Broaden financial resources and be a living god of wealth for the masses."
    In order to strengthen the collaboration between industry, agriculture, and commerce, the county party committee conducted education on the overall concept for various departments, overcame departmentalism, and at the same time put forward the common struggle slogan of "thousands of hearts, ten thousand hearts, one heart for 300 斤 (jīn)", and established a collaborative conference system. In 1957, the county party committee convened a total of eight comprehensive collaborative conferences and more than 30 special collaborative conferences.
    In industry-agriculture-commerce collaboration, the county party committee also put forward the action slogan of "industry-commerce integration, jointly supporting agricultural production." What agriculture needs, industry produces; what raw materials industry needs, commerce supplies; what industry produces, commerce promotes; thereby solving the contradiction of production, supply, and sales.
    Between merchants, the principle of mutual cooperation and common promotion was implemented, and the relationship has also been greatly improved. For example, in 1957, in order to vigorously develop pig raising, the county party committee convened a special collaborative meeting of the supply and marketing, banking, grain, and agricultural departments. The supply and marketing cooperative sent people to buy piglets, the bank provided loans to solve funding problems, the grain bureau adjusted feed, and the agricultural department organized and mobilized the masses to feed them. The work went very smoothly.
    Because the problem of agricultural, industrial, and commercial collaboration was solved, things that were difficult to do in the past are now easy to do. Once the party committee calls, everyone actively responds, which not only promotes the leap forward in agriculture, but also promotes the leap forward in industry and finance and trade work.
    Eliminate Bureaucracy, Facilitate Purchase and Sales
    In the past, in finance and trade enterprises, there was a relatively common bureaucratic style, only taking care of their own convenience, regardless of the convenience of the masses, queuing to buy things, getting angry when selling things, and mechanically implementing the work system. Therefore, some people reflected, "I would rather pay more to private merchants than look at the faces of state-owned merchants." Since the rectification movement, because the employees have personally gone to production, contacted reality, and learned about the sufferings of the masses, there has been a significant change in the work style and service attitude.
    In the office system, they proposed "eliminate bureaucracy, remove the office sign, buy whenever you come." Now, whether in stores or banks, you can no longer see the signs of office hours. For the convenience of calling the door at night, "earth electric bells" have been installed from the store door to the business room, and it is written on the door: If you have something to call the door in the middle of the night, just pull the bell.
    In order to facilitate the purchase and sale of the masses and save labor for the masses, the commercial department proposed that in terms of sales, it is necessary to "people leave the counter, goods leave the shelves, construction sites become markets, and sell goods to the door." In terms of acquisition, it is necessary to "acquire in the countryside, combine purchase and sales, go out carrying goods, and return carrying waste products." In order to expand the acquisition business, the supply and marketing cooperative has generally strengthened publicity. Each sales department displays samples of local products and waste products, and purchasing agents also bring samples when they go to the countryside. In the supply of agricultural machinery, the supply and marketing cooperative proposed to "machines walk in front, technology follows behind, agricultural and commercial integration is tight, ensuring supply and use." Various county-level commercial units and township supply and marketing cooperatives have generally established peddlers who go out early and return late, carrying a load of goods when they go out, and returning with a load of eggs and waste products. According to statistics from county-level commercial units, in the past year, they have gone to the countryside to deliver goods 4,275 times, with a total purchase and sales amount of 250,000 yuan. According to preliminary calculations, after the county has carried out the business of acquiring in the countryside and delivering goods to the door, it can save at least 18,000 labor forces for the masses. In addition, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives have established mobile supply groups on the construction site, and the grain department has also established grain stations on the construction site, which greatly facilitates the masses.
    Queuing to buy grain and troublesome grain delivery are also the things that the masses have the most opinions about. In order to solve this problem, the grain department has taken the method of registering grain samples door-to-door, settling accounts in advance, and collecting grain regularly, which not only eliminated the phenomenon of queuing, but also eliminated the unevenness of busy and idle, saved manpower, and improved work efficiency. In terms of grain collection, they also adopted the method of doing troublesome work in agricultural cooperatives. During the unified purchase period and before warehousing, the grain department concentrated all its strength to go to the agricultural cooperatives in each township to conduct quality inspection, and those that did not meet the standards were processed locally, changing the practice of processing in the grain station. In this way, it can be received whenever it arrives, and it can save the masses more than 20,000 human and animal power a year.

    通政治  通生产  通业务
    中共沁县委员会
    编者按：沁县的财贸工作做得很好。他们根据新的形势和任务，端正了经营思想和服务方向，既促进了农业生产，也发展了自己的业务。我们推荐这份中共沁县委员会所作的总结，供各县的领导同志和在财贸系统工作的同志们参考。
    农业合作化以后，在沁县出现了财贸工作赶不上农业需要的矛盾。比如：农业需要一些简单的小型机械和新式农具，但财贸部门供应不上，或者商品来了已过季，成了马后炮。农业社需要又便宜又耐用的生产资料和生活资料，而财贸部门却进些昂贵的商品。县联合厂有自制物美价廉的小钢磨，供销社却从天津买进一批又贵又不适用的钢磨，一直卖不出去。农民需要美观、耐用而又便宜的布，可是纺织品公司进的是大批的绸缎和高价的布匹，农民买不起。农村里大量的土特产品，不是收购部门挑挑拣拣压价，就是农民没时间运送。结果农民不能提高购买力，收购部门收不到东西。
    随着农业生产高潮的出现，这个矛盾更加尖锐了。例如去年修建迎春水库的时候，需要八角钢、炮棒、水泥等很多器材；但是沁县百货公司经营的五金交电器材只有五百多种，而且大部分不是水利建设上所需要的。因此，今天买回这样，明天又缺那样，工作很被动。同时，几年来，由于多种经济生产发展比较缓慢，群众的收入仍然比较少。而要发展多种经济生产，就需要解决资金、原料、产品销路和技术指导等一系列的问题。为了解决这些问题，财贸工作也必须迅速赶上去。
    在这种情况下，县委纠正了孤立发展农业的观点，把财贸工作抓了起来。
    政治当统帅
    县委首先加强了政治思想工作，由县委书记、县长负责，整顿财贸工作队伍，扭转服务方向，端正经营思想。确定财贸系统的方针是：面向生产，面向群众，打破商业陈规，一切为了工农。
    新的方针对埋头业务，追逐利润的人们是不习惯的，因此立即在财贸系统中引起了强烈的反应。有的人说：“常说商业为工农、生产服务，谁来为商业服务？”有的说：“一天三顿饭，吃了柜台站，有买卖，算一算，没买卖，瞎扯谈；商业的本分，购销存调赚！”有的说：农业生产是党委和农业部门的事，与商业部门没有什么关系。当迎春水库开始建设，县委确定由县百货公司副经理栗全堂担任水库器材供应工作的时候，公司大多数干部认为这是“不务正业”，只对农业有利，对自己没有利。
    于是，县委提出了三个问题，在财贸系统中组织了三次大辩论：（一）支援农业生产是不是政治问题？（二）支援农田水利建设是不是正业？（三）支援农业生产是一利还是两利？以这三个问题，在财贸系统中摆下了社会主义与资本主义斗争的战场，两种思想展开了激烈的斗争。有的说：“自古以来，工农兵学商，各管各一行，商业做买卖，为的是赚钱。”有的说：“社会衣食用，唯我独经营，他不来买由他去，何苦上山去供应！”有的说：“银钱钞票，就是财贸工作的大道。”但是，事实终归是最雄辩的。药材公司的同志们说：“收购不回药材，药材工厂就得停工，咱公司就没买卖，再不用说治病救人了。”百货公司王俊林说：“我们不支援生产，生产上要啥没啥，就没法发展。生产不发展，农民就没有钱，你减价赔钱也枉然。那时候，我们不但说不上发展，而且要关门收摊，无路可走！”老店员王昌小说：“支援工农业，一举三得利。农业发展农民有钱，咱的推销额就大。工业发展，咱有货源。支援了工农业，工农业就把咱抬起来了，这正是社会主义的最大优点。”经过月余的思想论战，社会主义经营思想占领了阵地，粉碎了“买卖论”，人们的思想统一了，觉悟提高了，从心底领会了县委所提出的方针，明确了财贸工作与农业、工业的关系，明确了商业在社会主义建设中的作用。人们说：“过去一天喊买叫卖，不知道为什么，光知道赚钱，连亏本也找不到原因。原来这里面是大有奔头啊！”
    参加生产　熟悉生产
    1957年以前，沁县财贸系统的干部有这么一种说法：“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专做买卖人”。这充分反映了财贸系统政治空气薄弱，不懂政策的情况。如收购员杨赖在乔村收猪时，八十七斤的猪硬要估成七十四斤，养猪户不同意，就把猪赶走了。杨安的一个老汉赶猪到故县镇收购站，站上不是挑拣就是“下班”不办公，弄得老汉往返赶了四次，共走了四百来里路。他气愤地说：“祖祖辈辈再不养猪了。”因而，不少膘猪外流，本县却收购不到。再加之近年来人员变动较大，又不肯钻，许多干部不通业务。如药材公司的经理、会计，干了两年多叫不上两种药材名称，这种情况几乎遍及整个财贸系统。
    造成这种状况，除了政治上的原因外，财贸工作人员长期脱离生产，脱离实际，也是一个极重要的原因。为此，县委提出了每个财贸干部都必须学通三套本领，即：“通政治、通生产、通业务”的行动口号，同时有计划地组织财贸部门的职工参加联合加工厂和农田水利建设的劳动。一年来，只县级四百多个财贸职工即做了五千八百多个劳动日。此外，还参加了企业内部的商品短途运输，装卸打捆，翻仓倒库等劳动，只粮食局一个单位，就减少了搬运工人十三个，为国家节省开支四千三百余元。
    直接参加生产劳动，不仅加强了农商关系，节省开支，而且扩大了业务，使财贸干部走上了“又红又专”的道路。例如，百货公司的干部和售货员参加抗旱和水利建设，用小镢挖土、用篮子担土，劳动成绩不大，费劲大。于是，他们就商量：“难道我们就不能进货供应铁镐、铁锹、榔头吗？就不可以进一些平车吗？就不可以进小矿车、小铁轨吗？”问题一提起来，就有同志说了：“不是不可以，而是关在家不知道。现在才知道商业对生产的作用了。”当水库开始挖基础的时候，正是寒冬十月，需要挖的深度在二公尺以上，但挖了不到一公尺就有了水。很多人需要在水里工作，怎能受得了呢？经过研究以后，他们想出了这样的办法：“穿布鞋担土，穿短腰胶鞋铲泥，穿长腰胶鞋下浅水，穿胶裤下深水”。想出了办法，立刻派人到太原购买了这些货物，及时供应了长短腰胶鞋和胶裤四百多件。如果不是深入实际，怎么会了解得这样具体呢？这个公司的副经理栗全堂，就是这样参加劳动钻研生产，把农业生产和水利建设上所需要的东西摸得烂熟。在公司里，人们称他为“农业百货专家”；在全县各个水利工地上，民工和干部亲昵地叫他“供应股长”。1957年内，百货公司共增加了生产、生活资料一千四百余种，占原有商品种类的64％。真是缺啥供啥，要啥有啥，被农民们誉为“万宝全的弟弟”（县联合加工厂被农民誉为“万宝全”）。
    经营什么，培植什么生产，参加什么劳动，搞什么试验田
    这是培养“三通”干部的一种重要方法。如供销社为了培植畜牧生产，和银行结合，与南余交农业社合伙办了一个优种牧畜场，现在已有荷兰牛、蒙古马、榆林母马等优种牲畜四十余头，今年准备增加到六十头。为了推广化肥和掌握各种化肥的使用，去年有二十一个基层供销社与农业社结合，亲自用化肥种了各种农作物的试验田，并达到了高额丰产。由于他们通过试验田掌握了各种化肥的性能和使用技术，所以在1957年化肥的推销工作上就很顺利，比1956年扩大了48％。
    上述这种方法，在今年又有了新的发展。各个财贸单位，在为自己找货源，为工业找原料，为群众开辟财源当好群众“活财神”的口号下，采取多种多样的形式，到生产中去大搞试验田。
    供销社在全县范围内开展了五养一种运动。即：养猪、养兔、养蜂、养鸡、养牲畜，种菜。现在他们已经和长盛乡农业社合办了来亨鸡优种场，与川沟农业社合办了纯种猪场，与石后农业社合办了养兔场，通过预购合同的办法，建立了蔬菜基地。此外，为了适应多种经济生产的发展需要，准备采取自办、工商合办、商农合办等形式在1958年内兴办造纸、制糖、水果加工等十多个小型工厂。
    药材公司制定了帮助农业社种植党参、生地等七种贵重药材的生产计划，并要求在两年内使沁县成为一个万亩药材县。现在已经训练了技术人员，购回大部种子，计划实现之后，每年将为群众增加一百六十多万元的收入。
    粮食部门在1958年内，除从技术上帮助农业社全部实现四无粮仓外，并与农业社结合，利用一切空地种植花生、葵花等油料作物二万五千亩，预计产量三百四十万斤。
    银行除与供销社结合扶植优种牧畜场外，以长盛乡为试验田，要扶植实现一个万口猪乡和一个纯种猪社。
    木材公司和城关农业社签定了培植苗圃的生产合同。
    财贸系统的会计们，为了深入实际与农业生产挂钩，也提出了“跳出办公室、辅导找上门、搞好三清社（账清、款清、财产清），支援农业大跃进的口号。全县财贸部门九十四个会计，采取了以基点建站，以乡建网的办法，对一百五十二个账簿不清的农业社，实行了包干辅导。这不仅对巩固农业社有重要的作用，而且还可以通过会计辅导工作进行调查研究工作。
    总之，沁县的财贸部门通过“经营什么，培植什么生产，参加什么劳动，搞什么试验田”的方法，走进了农业生产中去，既锻炼了干部，取得了生产经验，又密切了与群众的联系；既培植了多种经济生产，为群众开辟了财源，又扩大了自己的业务。以上这些计划实现以后，每户农民将要增加一百一十多元的现金收入，这对支援农业生产将是一个重大的贡献。
    组织全面协作
    县委把全县分了农、林、水、牧、工、商、文、卫等七条战线，线线都有一个书记挂帅，各条战线各个时期的工作任务都是以生产为中心，由党委统一部署统一检查，分战线保证完成。如在支援农田水利建设中，县委给予商业部门的任务是：“千方百计找货源，供应工作赶在先。”在发展多种经济方面给予的任务是：“广开财源，要当好群众的活财神”。
    为了加强工、农、商之间的协作，县委对各个部门进行了整体观念的教育，克服本位主义，同时提出了“千条心、万条心、一心为了三百斤”的共同奋斗口号，建立了协作会议制度。1957年县委共召开了八次综合性的协作会议和三十多次专题性的协作会议。
    在工农商协作上，县委还提出了“工商结合、合力支援农业生产”的行动口号。农业需要什么，工业就生产什么；工业需要什么原料，商业就供应什么；工业生产什么，商业就推销什么；从而解决了产、供、销的矛盾。
    在商商之间，贯彻了互相配合、共同促进的原则，关系也有很大改进。如1957年县委为了大力发展养猪事业，召开了供销、银行、粮食、农业部门的专题协作会议，供销社出人买小猪，银行贷款解决资金问题，粮食局调剂饲料，农业部门组织发动群众喂养，工作进行得很顺利。
    由于解决了农、工、商协作的问题，过去难办的事情，现在好办了，党委一号召，大家都积极响应，既促进了农业的跃进，也促进了工业和财贸工作的跃进。
    打掉官气，便利购销
    过去，在财贸企业单位中，比较普遍地存在着机关化的作风，只管自己方便，不管群众方便，买东西站队，卖东西呕气，机械地执行上下班制度，所以有的群众反映，“宁到私商多出钱，不到国营看眉眼”。从整风运动以来，由于职工们亲身到了生产中去，接触了实际，知道了群众的甘苦，所以在工作作风上服务态度上有了显著的转变。
    在办公制度上，他们提出了“打掉官气，摘掉办公牌，随到随买”。现在不论在商店和银行，都已经看不到上下办公的牌子了，为了夜间叫门方便，从商店的大门到营业室，都安上了“土电铃”，并在门上写着：半夜有事来叫门，只要拉铃就能行。
    为了便利群众购销，为群众节省劳力，商业部门提出在推销方面，要做到“人离柜台货离架，工地变市场，卖货送上门”。在收购方面，要做到：“收购下乡，购销结合，出门担商品，回家担废品”。为了扩大收购业务，供销社普遍加强了宣传工作，各个门市部都陈列了土产废品的样品，收购员下乡也带上样品。在农业机械的供应方面，供销社提出要作到“机器前边走，技术后边跟，农商结合紧，保供又保用”。各个县级商业单位和各乡供销社普遍建立了货郎担，早出晚归，出去商品一担，回来鸡蛋废品满担。据县级商业单位的统计，在去年一年中，下乡送货达四千二百七十五人次，购销总额达二十五万元。经初步计算，全县在开展了收购下乡、送货上门的业务以后，最少能为群众节省一万八千个劳动力。此外，国营商业和供销合作社都在工地设立了流动供应组，粮食部门也在工地设立了粮站，大大便利了群众。
    买粮站队，送粮费事，也是群众最有意见的一件事情。为了解决这个问题，粮食部门采取了携带粮食样品上门登记、提前结算、定期领粮的办法，不但消灭了排队现象，而且消灭了忙闲不均，节省了人力，提高了工作效率。在收粮方面，他们也采取了把费事的工作做在农业社的办法。在统购期间、入库以前，粮食部门集中所有的力量，分赴各乡农业社进行质量检验，不合规格的，原地加工，改变了粮站加工的作法。这样一来，就可以做到随到随收，一年可以给群众节省人畜力二万多个。
