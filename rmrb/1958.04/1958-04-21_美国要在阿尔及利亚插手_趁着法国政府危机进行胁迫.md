Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: On the third day of the French government crisis, rumors suddenly spread that the United States was trying to force France to negotiate with Algerian nationalists. This news caused a great shock among the French ruling circles.

The afternoon editions of Parisian newspapers said yesterday that the news was revealed by Murphy, the U.S. representative for "mediation" of the French-Tunisian dispute. Before leaving Paris on the 17th, he held a private press conference, after which American journalists in Paris issued this "explosive" news. The news said that the United States had formed a view during the "mediation" that France itself could not solve the Algerian problem, and that this problem would sooner or later become an international problem. Therefore, France must negotiate with the "Algerian Liberation Committee," which is said to be possibly established at the meeting of representatives of Tunisia, Morocco, and the Algerian National Liberation Front scheduled for April 27. The news also said that the Americans believed that the reason for negotiating with the Algerians was to make them friendly to the West and alienated from the national independence forces in the Middle East.

After the above news came out, French "caretaker" Foreign Minister Pineau summoned U.S. Ambassador to Paris Amory Houghton yesterday morning, asking him to "clarify" the U.S. attitude towards the Algerian issue. In the afternoon of the same day, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that it was "surprising" for the United States to express its views on the Algerian issue in this way.

On the same day, the seemingly troubled French Ambassador to Washington, Alphand, was also ordered to meet with U.S. Acting Secretary of State Herter and talked with him for about an hour. After the meeting, the State Department issued a statement saying that speculation about the U.S. Algerian policy was "unfounded." The communique also said that the United States was "very concerned" about the Algerian conflict and believed that it was necessary to seek a "peaceful, democratic, and just solution," but it hoped that France itself could find such a solution.

However, the U.S. statement could not quell the anti-American wave that had been rekindled among right-wing figures in France, who were very sensitive to U.S. ambitions in North Africa. The right-wing newspaper "Paris News" said: "No matter what reassuring statements the United States issues, what denials have been made in the past, and what denials will be made in the future," the above news has already shown "the essence of American diplomacy." "Le Parisien Libéré" said that the United States' actions to interfere in the Algerian issue are more rude and unbearable than any previous interference.

According to predictions from Parisian political circles, the news about the United States coercing France to negotiate with the Algerian side will deepen the French political crisis.

### 美国要在阿尔及利亚插手  趁着法国政府危机进行胁迫

    美国要在阿尔及利亚插手
    趁着法国政府危机进行胁迫
    新华社19日讯　巴黎消息：在法国发生政府危机的第三天，突然风传美国要迫使法国同阿尔及利亚民族主义者谈判。这个消息在法国统治集团中间引起了很大震动。
    巴黎下午出版的报纸在昨天说，这个消息是美国“斡旋”法突纠纷的代表墨菲透露出来的。他17日在离开巴黎之前，举行了一个不公开的记者招待会，随后在巴黎的美国新闻记者就发出了这个“爆炸性”消息。这个消息说，美国在“斡旋”期间形成一种看法，认为法国自己不可能解决阿尔及利亚问题，这个问题迟早要成为国际问题。因此，法国必须同“阿尔及利亚解放委员会”谈判，这个解放委员会据说可能在预定4月27日举行的突尼斯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表会议上成立。消息还说，美国人认为，所以要同阿尔及利亚人谈判，是为了要使他们同西方友好，而同中东民族独立力量疏远。
    上述消息传出后，法国“看守”政府的外交部长比诺在昨天上午就召见了美国驻巴黎大使阿莫里·霍顿，要求他“澄清”美国对阿尔及利亚问题的态度。当天下午，法国外交部发言人表示，美国用这种方式来表明它对阿尔及利亚问题的看法这是“叫人吃惊的”。
    同一天，显得烦恼的法国驻华盛顿大使阿尔芳还奉命去见美国代理国务卿赫脱，同他谈了大约一个钟头。会谈后国务院发表声明说，对美国的阿尔及利亚政策的猜测是“没有根据的”。公报还说，美国“非常关心”阿尔及利亚冲突，并且认为很有必要求得一个“和平、民主和公正的解决办法”，但是它希望法国自己能够找出这样一个解决办法来。
    但是，美国的声明并不能平息在法国右翼人士中间重新掀起的反美浪潮，这些人对美国在北非的野心非常敏感。右翼报纸“巴黎新闻”说：“不管美国发表什么叫人安心的声明，过去提出过什么否认，而且将来还要提出什么否认”，上述消息已经表明“美国外交的实质是什么”。“解放了的巴黎人报”说，美国干涉阿尔及利亚问题的行动比以前任何时候的干涉行动更加粗野，更加令人不能忍受。
    据巴黎政界人士预料，关于美国胁迫法国同阿尔及利亚方面谈判的消息将使得法国的政治危机加深。
