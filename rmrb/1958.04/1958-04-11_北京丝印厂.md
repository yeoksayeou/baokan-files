Construction Blossoms

    Beijing Silk Printing Factory

    The Beijing Silk Printing Factory officially commenced production on the 8th. This factory can print patterns, calligraphy, and paintings on the surfaces of various products made of wood, iron, paper, cloth, leather, glass, and plastics.

    A unique advantage of silk screen prints is that they are resistant to wind, sun, and rain, and can maintain their bright colors for many years. If they become soiled, they can be wiped clean with a damp cloth and will look as good as new.

    The factory began preparations for construction last November, with the original plan to commence production in the third quarter of this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京丝印厂
    北京市丝印厂8日正式投入生产。这个工厂可以在木、铁、纸、布、皮革、玻璃、塑胶等各种制品的平面上印制图案和字画等。
    丝印品独特的优点是不怕风吹日晒雨淋，能常年保持色泽鲜艳，如有沾污，只要用湿布一揩仍然很新。
    这个工厂是去年11月开始筹建的，原来计划是今年第三季度投入生产。　（新华社）
