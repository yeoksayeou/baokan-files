The Wisdom of the Masses is Limitless, Tool Reform is Blooming Everywhere
Introducing Several New Waterwheels Created by Farmers in Changge, Henan
Collection of Tool Reforms in Henan
Modified Liberation-Style Waterwheel
Xue Jingtang, a member of the Guangming Fourth Agricultural Cooperative in Daming Township, Qingfeng County, spent only two yuan to modify a Liberation-style waterwheel, increasing its water output by five times. All four hundred waterwheels in the township have now been modified.
Farmer-Made Culverts
The Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Xinyang County uses bamboo strips, lime, and mortar to make culverts, which can be used as substitutes for cement culverts.
The advantages of this type of culvert are its low cost, durability, and the ability to make it in any diameter size. It can be used in reservoirs, ponds, and dams.
The manufacturing method of the culvert is very simple: weave bamboo strips into a cylinder, then mix lime and fine sand (one catty of lime and three catties of fine sand) into a thick paste, and then mold and install it. However, it must be molded and installed on-site where the culvert is to be used, and cannot be moved. The foundation must be cleaned and compacted, and a layer of lime slurry more than three inches thick must be laid.
Simple Wooden Theodolite
Li Guoxiang, a student at the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy School, made a simple wooden theodolite after being sent to Xichuan County to participate in labor production, helping farmers overcome the difficulty of lacking surveying instruments when building reservoirs and digging canals. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
Changge County, Henan Province, recently held an exhibition of water-lifting tools. Here are three types of fast waterwheels selected for reference.
Two Dragons Sucking Pearl Waterwheel
This was created by Xue Mengliu of Xinlu Eighteenth Cooperative, Chengguan Township, Changge County, and can irrigate ten mu of land per day. The structure is roughly the same as the "hand-cranked single-pipe waterwheel." When in use, two people sit on either end of the pressure bar and take turns moving up and down to draw water.
Leap Forward Fast Double-Pipe Waterwheel
This was made by Li Wentang of Lianfeng First Cooperative, Shuangmiao Li Township, Changge. It can be cranked by two or three to four people. Although the cost is about one hundred yuan, the water output is high, and it can irrigate fifteen to eighteen mu of land per day.
Leap Forward Fast Waterwheel
This was invented by Yue Shuichao of "May Fourth" Fourteenth Cooperative, Heshangqiao Township, Changge. It has now been improved with the addition of a large flywheel. This makes cranking easier, faster, and increases the water output. The daily irrigation capacity has increased from the original twelve to fourteen mu to seventeen to twenty mu.

    群众智慧无穷无尽  工具改革遍地开花
    介绍河南长葛农民创造的几种新水车
    河南改革工具集纳
    改装的解放式水车
    清丰县大明乡光明第四农业社社员薛敬堂只用两元钱，改装了解放式水车，出水量比原来提高五倍。全乡四百部水车现全部已改装。
    农民自制的涵管
    信阳县红光农业社用竹篾、石灰、沙浆制成涵管，可以代替水泥涵管使用。
    这种涵管的好处是成本低，坚固耐用，管的口径大小可以随意制作，水库、塘、堰都可以使用。
    涵管的制造方法很简单，用竹篾编成圆筒，再用石灰和细沙（一斤石灰三斤细沙）拌搅成稠糊，进行塑制安装就成。但是必须在使用涵管的地方就地塑制安装，不能移动，并需将地基清好夯实，铺上三寸多厚的石灰浆。
    木制简便经纬仪
    河南省水利学校学生李国祥，下放到淅川县参加劳动生产后，制造了一个木制简便经纬仪，帮助农民克服了修水库、开渠道缺乏测量仪器的困难。　（据新华社讯）
    河南长葛县最近举行了提水工具展览会，这里选刊了三种快速水车供参考。
    二龙吸珠水车
    这是长葛县城关乡新路十八社薛梦留创造的，每天可浇十亩地。构造和“手摇单管水车”大体相同。使用时两人坐在压杆的两头轮流上下，即可吸出水来。
    跃进快速双管水车
    这是长葛双庙李乡连丰一社李文堂制造的，可以用两个人摇，也可以用三至四个人摇。造价虽需要百元左右，但出水率高，每日可浇地十五亩至十八亩。
    跃进快速水车
    这是长葛和尚桥乡“五四”十四社岳水潮发明的，现在又作了改进，加了一个大甩轮。这样摇起来轻了，速度快了，出水率提高了，每天浇地由原来的十二亩至十四亩，提高到十七亩至二十亩。（附图片）
