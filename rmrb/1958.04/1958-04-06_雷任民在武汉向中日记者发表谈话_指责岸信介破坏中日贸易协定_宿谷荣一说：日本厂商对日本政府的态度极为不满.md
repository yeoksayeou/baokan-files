Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th - Yesterday evening, Lei Renmin, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, met with Chinese and Japanese journalists in Wuhan to discuss the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

Lei Renmin first accused the Nobusuke Kishi government of consistently adopting a hostile attitude towards the development of Sino-Japanese trade relations. He said: The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement has been signed for a month, but Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi not only has not expressed guarantees and support, but also, under the direct and indirect pressure of American imperialism, stubbornly ignores the wishes of the Japanese people and repeatedly obstructs, undermines, and attempts to overturn the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. This is something we find extremely regrettable. Lei Renmin pointed out that, looking back at the period before the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, the Kishi government successively used the fingerprint issue and the issue of limiting the number of representatives of business institutions as pretexts to obstruct the signing of the agreement. Since the signing of the agreement on March 5, the Kishi government has attempted to take measures to overturn this agreement, which is concentrated in the matter of Kishi Nobusuke writing a personal letter to Chiang Kai-shek. The Kishi government publicly declared that it does not recognize the right of Chinese business representative offices to fly the national flag, and declared that Article 92 of the Japanese Criminal Code regarding the act of damaging foreign national flags will not apply to the People's Republic of China; this is actually openly condoning activities that would damage our national flag. In the past, China has hung the Chinese national flag at commodity exhibitions held in Tokyo and Osaka. Today, the Kishi government's attitude is merely a preparation for overturning the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Lei Renmin pointed out that the Japanese flag is now flying high on the building of the Japanese commodity exhibition in Wuhan, but the Kishi government has adopted a completely opposite attitude towards the hanging of the Chinese national flag, and the Chinese people express their great indignation at this.

Lei Renmin pointed out: The Kishi government has described the treatment stipulated in the agreement and memorandum regarding providing personnel of business representative offices with security guarantees and work convenience under the principle of reciprocity as "privileges" and "extraterritoriality" and opposed them, merely as a pretext for undermining the agreement. The Kishi government's so-called refusal to give representative offices "privileges" actually means not guaranteeing the safety of staff and the convenience of carrying out their work, thus making the establishment of the offices impossible.

When talking about the issue of China sending advance personnel to Japan, Lei Renmin said: Under the current circumstances, it is not the time to send advance personnel. It depends on the Japanese government changing its hostile attitude towards our country. The Chinese commodity exhibitions originally planned to be held in Nagoya and Fukuoka will also be difficult to hold until the attitude of the Japanese government is clarified.

When answering a reporter's question about whether Sino-Japanese trade would be affected before the issue of establishing mutual business representative offices is resolved, Lei Renmin said that China will not announce the cessation of trade with the Japanese people. The Chinese people have always advocated promoting Sino-Japanese trade and are willing to minimize the impact of the issue of establishing business representative offices on Sino-Japanese trade. However, this does not mean that China must trade with Japan. China's first five-year plan was completed ahead of schedule and exceeded its targets precisely when Japan followed the United States in implementing "embargo" measures against China; on this point, the Kishi government still has a great illusion.

Regarding the views on the current situation of the Japanese people, Lei Renmin said, we express sympathy and understanding for the current situation of the Japanese people. We understand the Japanese people's desire to develop Sino-Japanese trade and to be friendly with the Chinese people. The current measures of the Kishi government are not the wishes of the Japanese people, and we will never change our friendly policy towards the Japanese people because of this.

Lei Renmin finally stated that he hopes that the Kishi government will clarify the above-mentioned issues as soon as possible so as to smoothly realize the Japanese people's urgent desire to develop trade relations with China.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th - Suekuni Eiichi, Vice President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Japan Commodity Exhibition, told reporters today that the Japanese manufacturers currently participating in the commodity exhibition in Wuhan are extremely dissatisfied with the Kishi government's obstruction and sabotage of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. They believe that the Kishi government's unreasonable and unfriendly attitude puts them in a very unfavorable position for future trade with China and will bring inevitable difficulties to the Japanese economy.

Suekuni Eiichi believes that the Kishi government's delay in making a positive response to the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement is a manifestation of losing the dignity of national independence and autonomy. It is ridiculous for the Kishi government to emphasize the "friendly relations" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and to be hostile to the 600 million Chinese people.

Suekuni Eiichi will leave Wuhan for Tokyo on the 7th. When answering a reporter's question about what efforts he plans to make after returning to his country to implement the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, he said that Japanese business circles and all friends who support the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement will further organize forces from all aspects such as local councilor alliances and National Assembly members, and launch a large-scale mass movement through the National Congress of Industry and Commerce, gradually urging the Kishi government to express its support for the agreement as soon as possible. Suekuni Eiichi believes that launching a large-scale movement is just and will definitely achieve good results.

    雷任民在武汉向中日记者发表谈话
    指责岸信介破坏中日贸易协定
    宿谷荣一说：日本厂商对日本政府的态度极为不满
    新华社武汉5日电　昨天晚上，中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民在武汉市接见中国和日本记者，就中日第四次贸易协定发表了谈话。
    雷任民首先指责岸信介政府一贯对中日贸易关系的发展采取敌视的态度。他说：中日第四次贸易协定签订已经一个月，日本首相岸信介不仅没有表示保证和支持，在美帝国主义直接和间接的压力下，竟顽固地无视日本人民的愿望，一再阻挠、破坏并企图推翻第四次中日贸易协定。这是我们认为十分遗憾的事。雷任民指出，回顾第四次中日贸易协定签订前，岸信介政府曾先后借口指纹问题以及限制商务机构代表人数问题，企图达到阻挠协定签订的目的。从3月5日签订协定以来，岸信介政府又企图采取措施推翻这个协定，它集中表现在岸信介给蒋介石写亲笔信一事上。岸信介政府公开声明不承认中国商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗，并且声明日本刑法第九十二条关于损坏外国国旗的行为将加以处罚的规定不适用于中华人民共和国；这实际上是公开纵容进行破坏我国国旗的活动。过去中国在东京、大阪举行商品展览会都曾挂过中国国旗，今天岸信介政府的态度只是为推翻第四次中日贸易协定进行准备。雷任民指出，日本国旗今天高挂在武汉日本商品展览会的建筑物上，岸信介政府却对悬挂中国国旗采取了截然相反的态度，中国人民对此表示十分愤慨。
    雷任民指出：岸信介政府把协定和备忘录规定的在对等原则下给商务代表机构人员以安全保证和工作方便的待遇，说成是“特权”、“治外法权”而加以反对，只是为破坏协定寻找借口。岸信介政府所谓不给代表机构以“特权”，实际上是不保证工作人员的安全和进行工作的方便，因而使机构的设置成为不可能。
    雷任民在谈到中国派先遣人员到日本去的问题时说：在目前情况下，不是派先遣人员去的时候，有待于日本政府改变敌视我国的态度。原计划在名古屋和福冈两地举行的中国商品展览会，在目前日本政府态度没有澄清以前，同样难以举行。
    雷任民在回答记者关于互设商务代表机构问题没有解决前，中日贸易是否会受到影响的问题时说，中国不会宣布和日本人民停止贸易往来，中国人民一向主张促进中日贸易，并愿意把设置商务代表机构问题对中日贸易的影响缩小到最小程度。但这并不是说中国非和日本进行贸易不可。中国第一个五年计划提前超额完成，正是在日本追随美国对中国执行“禁运”措施的时候；在这一点上，岸信介政府还存在着很大的错觉。
    关于对日本人民当前处境的看法，雷任民说，我们对日本人民当前的处境寄予同情和谅解。日本人民要求发展中日贸易，要求和中国人民友好的愿望，我们是了解的。岸信介政府当前的措施不是日本人民的愿望，我们决不会因此改变对日本人民的友好政策。
    雷任民最后表示，他希望岸信介政府早日澄清上述问题，以便顺利实现日本人民要求与中国发展贸易关系的迫切愿望。
    新华社武汉5日电　日本国际贸易促进协会副会长、日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一今天向记者发表谈话说，目前在武汉参加商品展览会的日本厂商，对于岸信介政府阻挠、破坏第四次中日贸易协定的行为极为不满，他们认为岸信介政府这种不合理、不友好的态度，使他们今后与中国进行贸易往来处于十分不利的地位，并且将给日本经济带来不可避免的困难。
    宿谷荣一认为，岸信介政府对于第四次中日贸易协定迟迟不作肯定答复，是丧失国家独立自主尊严的一种表现。岸信介政府强调与台湾蒋介石集团的“友好关系”，而与六万万中国人民为敌，是很可笑的行为。
    宿谷荣一将于7日离开武汉回东京。他在回答记者关于他回国后准备对实施第四次中日贸易协定作那些努力的问题时说，日本工商界与一切支持第四次中日贸易协定的朋友们，将进一步组织地方议员联盟、国会议员等各方面的力量，并且通过全国工商业代表大会，展开一个大规模的群众运动，步步促使岸信介政府早日对协定表示支持的态度。宿谷荣一认为，展开大规模的运动是正义的，它一定能收到良好的效果。
