Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 2nd—In order to assist democratic party members and non-party democratic personages in their self-reform and great leap forward, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has decided to organize visiting groups to go to the Foshan and Zhanjiang special districts for visits.

About eighty people, including members of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, heads of various democratic parties, and non-party democratic personages, are participating in this visit. The first group is going to the Foshan Special District, with Chen Rutang as the head of the group, and the second group is going to the Zhanjiang Special District, with Zhang Gengcun as the head of the group.

The visiting groups will spend a month among the workers and peasants, "dismounting from their horses to appreciate the flowers," to see with their own eyes the situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, so as to deepen the visitors' understanding of the superiority of the socialist system, strengthen the visitors' connection with the workers and peasants, and establish the view that labor is glorious.
