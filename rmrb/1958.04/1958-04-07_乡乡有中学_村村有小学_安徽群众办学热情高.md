Xinhua News Agency, Hefei – A mass movement for running schools has formed in the cities and villages of Anhui Province. According to incomplete statistics, recently, the province has established 2,654 agricultural middle schools and vocational schools, with an enrollment of more than 100,000 students; and more than 8,000 elementary schools, with nearly 300,000 children enrolled. Now, many counties have achieved a situation where every township has a middle school, every village has an elementary school, and every household has students. In counties such as Xiao, Dangshan, Lai'an, and Fengyang, the enrollment rate of school-age children has reached over 90%. Xiao County has established more than 540 agricultural middle schools and spare-time middle schools, averaging nine schools per township.

The teaching forms of the people-run schools in various places are diverse. Some adopt spare-time learning in the morning and evening, while others adopt half-day or alternate-day learning. School buildings utilize vacant houses such as ancestral halls and temples. School funding is raised according to the principle of "whoever studies pays"; desks and benches needed by the school are brought by the students themselves. Most of the teachers are hired from junior and senior high school graduates who have not continued their education, cadres who have been transferred to lower levels, agricultural technology extension stations, and factory technical cadres.

    乡乡有中学　村村有小学
    安徽群众办学热情高
    据新华社合肥讯　在安徽省的城市和农村里，群众办学已形成热潮。据不完全统计，最近，全省已办农业中学、职业学校二千六百五十四所，入学人数达十万多人；小学八千多所，入学儿童近三十万人。现在，有不少的县已作到了乡乡有中学，村村有小学，户户有学生。萧县、砀山、来安、凤阳等县学龄儿童入学率已达90％以上。萧县已办好农业中学、业余中学五百四十多所，平均每乡有九所。
    各地民办学校的教学形式是多种多样的。有的采取早晚业余学习，有的采取半日或隔日学习。校舍利用祠堂、庙宇等空闲房子。学校经费，是按谁读书谁出钱原则来筹集的；学校需用的桌凳由学生自带。教师大部分是聘请未升学的初中和高中毕业生、下放干部、农业技术推广站和工厂技术干部担任。
