Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, sent a letter to Eisenhower on the 4th, announcing the Soviet government's decision to unilaterally halt nuclear weapons testing from March 31st of this year, and suggesting that the US and British governments also take the same step. This is a formal appeal made by the Soviet government to the US and British governments. This suggestion from the Soviet government represents the fundamental interests of people all over the world and concerns the safety and happiness of all mankind.

Since the Soviet Union announced its decision to unilaterally cease nuclear testing, it has received widespread support from governments and people around the world. On the 4th, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the 600 million Chinese people, expressed warm support for the Soviet decision to halt nuclear weapons testing, pointing out that this significant action by the Soviet Union demonstrated the Soviet people's will for peace and their confidence in the world's forces for peace. He also firmly believed that the United States and Britain should take the same measures. The governments and public opinion of all socialist countries have also expressed their unanimous support for the Soviet decision, once again demonstrating that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a strong fortress for maintaining world peace.

The Soviet decision has also been sponsored by many governments in Asia and Africa and by neutral countries. Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated, "We of course welcome it and are happy about it." He also said, "I can never understand the practice of being unwilling to stop nuclear testing even for a while." Afghan Prime Minister Daoud, Thai Prime Minister Nai Thanom, Austrian President Schärf, and officials from Indonesia and the United Arab Republic all expressed their welcome for the Soviet proposal. Even in Western countries, many political figures, such as former Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer, leaders of the British Labour Party, and Australian Labour Party Chairman Evatt, welcomed and valued the Soviet decision, believing that the West should follow the Soviet example and stop nuclear weapons testing.

And an unprecedentedly broad movement to stop nuclear weapons testing is flourishing. People and figures from all walks of life, regardless of class or profession, who love peace in various countries of the world have risen up to demand the cessation of nuclear testing. The World Federation of Democratic Youth and the Women's International Democratic Federation have both issued calls for young people and women to actively fight to stop the testing of nuclear weapons. The British people's great peace demonstration has already set out from London and is heading towards the Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Research Centre. The nearly five thousand-strong marchers, braving rain and snow, march forward singing with large banners bearing slogans such as: "No More Testing," "No Missile Bases Here," "No H-Bombs for Britain." Wherever they passed, they were welcomed by hundreds of thousands of residents. One hundred and fifty representatives from organizations such as the Tokyo Metropolitan Student Union Federation demonstrated in front of the US Embassy in Japan. Fifty representatives from the Tokyo Metropolitan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and its district branches met with the speakers of both houses of the Japanese Diet, demanding that the United States respond to the Soviet call to stop nuclear testing and immediately halt the nuclear weapons testing scheduled to take place on Eniwetok Atoll. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Federation of Student Autonomy Associations, and the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs have decided to convene a large-scale mass rally on April 19 to oppose the United States' continued nuclear weapons testing. Public opinion in Western European countries, and even newspapers in Uruguay and Argentina in South America, also warmly welcomed the Soviet proposal. Even in the United States, the broad masses of the people and figures from all walks of life have joined the struggle against nuclear testing. The Communist Party of the United States issued a statement believing that the US government should stop atomic and hydrogen bomb testing, and called on the American people to now use their mass organizations—unions, churches, and mass groups—to make Washington feel their desire to stop testing atomic and hydrogen bombs and to ban nuclear weapons, immediately convene a summit meeting, and expand trade and cultural ties with socialist countries. Twenty-two American pastors belonging to different churches have demanded that the United States stop nuclear testing. Five hundred participants in the "Walk for Peace" movement held a rally and demonstration in New York on the 5th to oppose the testing of nuclear weapons. The US government's attitude of refusing to stop nuclear testing has been criticized by domestic public opinion.

In the face of the Soviet Union's pioneering peace initiative of unilaterally halting nuclear weapons testing, in the face of the urgent demands of the people of the world, what reason do the US government and the British government have to delay stopping nuclear weapons testing? Stopping nuclear weapons testing is originally a relatively easy thing to reach an agreement on, and this is because currently only the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain possess atomic weapons. The Soviet Union, not only has always suggested reaching an agreement on stopping nuclear weapons testing in the past, but now has also taken the lead in announcing a unilateral halt to testing. This fundamentally shatters the deceptive talk fabricated by the US and Britain in the past that all the Soviet Union's proposals to stop nuclear weapons testing are nothing but "propaganda," "propaganda." Everyone can see clearly that the Soviet Union has now seriously stopped nuclear weapons testing, and it is no longer "propaganda." The Soviet decision has convinced people all over the world that the Soviet Union has made a major contribution to completely eliminating the threat of a devastating atomic war to mankind. In order to further solve this problem that is deeply troubling the world, the problem now is for the United States and Britain to immediately respond to the Soviet call and announce an unconditional halt to nuclear weapons testing!

Immediately stopping nuclear weapons testing is the first step towards banning the production and use of nuclear weapons, and the Soviet Union has already taken the first step. For the sake of human happiness, the people of the world must resolutely demand that the US and British governments follow up with this step. As long as the people of the world are firmly united and fight tenaciously to achieve this goal, then the wish to stop nuclear weapons testing can certainly be realized, just as Premier Zhou Enlai said: "The great cause of hundreds of millions of people around the world to safeguard peace is bound to be victorious."

### 要求美英立即停止核武器试验

    要求美英立即停止核武器试验
    苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫，4日写给艾森豪威尔一封信，宣布苏联政府决定从今年3月31日起单方面停止核武器试验，建议美国和英国政府也采取同样的步骤。这是苏联政府向美英两国政府正式提出的呼吁。苏联政府的这个建议，是代表了全世界人民根本利益、关系着全人类的安全和幸福。
    自从苏联宣布了单方面停止核试验的决定以后，已经得到全世界各国政府和人民群众的广泛支持。我国周恩来总理4日曾代表中国六亿人民表示热烈支持苏联决定停止核武器试验，指出苏联的这一重大行动显示了苏联人民的和平意志，显示了苏联人民对世界和平力量的信心。并且坚决认为美国和英国应该采取同样措施。所有社会主义国家的政府和舆论，也先后表示一致拥护苏联这一决定，又一次表现了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是维护世界和平的强大堡垒。
    苏联的决定，也获得了亚非许多国家政府和中立国家的赞助。印度总理尼赫鲁声明说：“我们当然欢迎它，我们为它感到高兴。”他还说：“我永远不能理解为什么不愿意停止核试验一个时候的那种做法。”阿富汗首相达乌德、泰国总理乃他侬、奥地利总统谢尔夫、印度尼西亚和阿拉伯联合共和国的官方，都表示欢迎苏联的建议。就在西方国家中，许多政界人士，像加拿大前外长皮尔逊、西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔、英国工党的领袖们，澳大利亚工党主席伊瓦特，都欢迎和重视苏联的决定，认为西方应当效法苏联的榜样，停止核武器试验。
    而一个规模空前广阔的停止核武器试验运动，正在蓬勃兴起。世界各国不分阶层，不分职业的爱好和平的人民和各界人士，都纷纷起来要求停止核试验。世界民主青联和国际民主妇联都发出号召，要求青年和妇女积极为停止试验核武器进行积极斗争。英国人民的和平大示威，已经从伦敦出发，向阿尔德马斯顿原子武器研究中心进发，将近五千人的游行行列高举着：“不要再进行（核）试验”“我们这里不要导弹基地”“英国不要氢弹”等等大标语，冒着雨雪严寒，高歌前进。所过之处，受到成千上万居民的欢迎。日本东京都学生自治会联合会等团体的一百五十个代表到美国驻日大使馆门前示威，东京都禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会和它所属的各区分会代表五十人，去见日本两院议长，要求美国响应苏联停止核试验的呼吁，立即停止预定在恩纳威托克岛进行的核武器试验。日本工会总评议会、全日本学生自治会总联合会、日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会已决定在4月19日召开大规模的群众大会，反对美国继续核武器试验。西欧各国公众的舆论，以至南美的乌拉圭、阿根廷的报纸，也热烈欢迎苏联的建议。就是在美国，广大人民和各界人士也参加到反对核试验的斗争中来。美国共产党发表声明，认为美国政府应当停止原子弹和氢弹试验，并且号召：美国人民现在应当通过自己的群众组织——工会、教会和群众团体来使华盛顿感觉到他们的愿望，停止试验原子弹和氢弹，以及禁止核武器，立即召开最高级会议和同社会主义国家扩大贸易和文化联系。属于不同教会的美国二十二位牧师，要求美国停止核试验。五百名“为和平而奔走”运动的参加者，5日在纽约举行了反对试验核武器的集会和游行示威。美国政府拒绝停止核试验的态度，已经遭到国内公众和舆论的抨击。
    面对着苏联单方面停止核武器试验的和平创举，面对着全世界人民的迫切要求，美国政府和英国政府还有什么理由拖延停止核武器试验呢？停止核武器试验，本来是比较容易达成协议的事情，这是由于目前拥有原子武器的国家只有苏联、美国和英国。而苏联，不仅过去一直建议就停止核武器试验达成协议，现在，并且已经首先宣布单方面停止试验，这就从根本上击破了美英两国过去所捏造的，苏联的一切停止核武器试验的建议，不过为的是“宣传”“宣传”而已的欺人之谈。谁也能看得清楚，苏联现在已经认真地停止核武器试验，而不再是什么“宣传”了。苏联的决定已经使全世界人民深信，苏联为了使人类彻底免除毁灭性的原子战争威胁，已经作出了重大的贡献。为了使这一个为全世界深感不安的问题，得到进一步的解决，现在的问题，就在美国和英国立即响应苏联的呼吁宣布无条件停止核武器试验！
    立即停止核武器试验，是禁止生产和使用核武器的第一步，苏联已经迈出了第一步。为了人类的幸福，全世界人民必须坚决要求美国和英国政府跟着迈出这一步。只要全世界人民坚定地团结起来，顽强地为实现这一目标而奋斗，那末，停止核武器试验的愿望是一定能够实现的，正像周恩来总理所说的：“世界亿万人民维护和平的伟大事业是一定要胜利的。”
