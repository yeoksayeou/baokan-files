A Lesson from the Previous Cart Overturned

    According to a "France-Presse" report, on the eve of the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Whitney, returning home to report on his work, Macmillan instructed him to convey to Eisenhower a British request: to revise the McMahon Act regarding atomic secrets.

    People remember that the issue of revising the McMahon Act was actually brought up by Eisenhower during the U.S.-British Washington talks in October last year. At that time, in order to get Britain to take the lead in accepting its missile base plan, the United States agreed to open the "scientific iron curtain" as an exchange condition. It is said that this is called "mutual dependence." But what was the result? After Britain signed and stamped the deed of sale to the United States as an overseas rocket launch site, the United States was slow to fulfill its promise, so that Macmillan had to humbly ask the United States to honor it!

    Now, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Defense Ministers Conference has begun, and the United States is taking the opportunity to intensify the promotion of its missile base plan. For those who want to exchange their country's sovereignty and security for some benefits from the United States, they should take the lesson from Macmillan's overturned cart.

    前车之鉴
    据“法新社”消息，在美国驻英大使惠特尼回国述职的前夕，麦克米伦叮嘱他向艾森豪威尔转述英国的一个要求：修改关于原子秘密的麦克马洪法。
    人们记得，修改麦克马洪法的问题，实际上是由艾森豪威尔在去年10月美英华盛顿会谈中提出来的。当时，美国为了要英国带头接受它的导弹基地计划，就答应以打开“科学铁幕”作为交换条件。据说，这就叫做“互相依赖”。可是结果呢？英国在给美国作海外火箭发射场的卖身契上签字画押之后，美国却迟迟不肯履行自己的诺言，以致麦克米伦为得不低三下四去请求美国兑现！
    现在，北大西洋集团国防部长会议开始举行了，美国乘机又在加紧推销它的导弹基地计划。对于那些想把自己国家的主权和安全作为代价从美国那里换得一些好处的人来说，应该接受麦克米伦的前车之鉴。
