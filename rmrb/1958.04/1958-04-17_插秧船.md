    Rice Planting Boat
    This newspaper reports that a rice planting boat, which can increase the efficiency of rice planting by more than double and reduce physical labor, is being promoted in Heng County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. According to incomplete statistics as of April 7, more than 1,890 boats have been built throughout the county.

    Some local women call this rice planting boat a "Liberation Boat." The boat has a seat board, and when transplanting rice seedlings, people sit on this board, with their feet and hands outside. When tired, they can lean against a wooden board erected on the seat board to rest. An umbrella, bamboo hat, or raincoat can be propped up on the top end of the upright board, and a lamp can be hung on it at night. With this boat, rice transplanters will no longer suffer from backaches, leg pains, or dizziness.

    One end of the boat is used to hold fertilizer, and the other end is used to hold seedlings. The amount held is more than a seedling tray, so it can also reduce the time spent by rice transplanters going back and forth to get fertilizer and seedlings.

    This boat is made of three-tenths-of-an-inch-thick thin boards, and its total weight is only twelve to fifteen pounds. It generally only sinks two centimeters into the soil in the field, so moving it around is not difficult. The rice transplanter only needs to sit on it and push their feet into the mud, and the boat will move backward.

    According to experiments, a rice transplanter with average skills can transplant one mu and four li of land in a whole day by sitting on this boat, all using small-row close planting. The strongest rice transplanters, without using the rice planting boat, transplanted an average of only six fen of land per person in the same amount of time.

    A rice planting boat can be made for 1.5 yuan, which is lower than the price of two seedling trays. If old wood is used, the price is even lower. The method is also simple. People with general knowledge of woodworking can make it. A carpenter can make two boats a day.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 15th: Ningbo Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, will universally use rice planting boats for early rice transplanting this year. This type of rice planting boat was recently successfully trial-produced by the Fengcun Township Wood Industry Cooperative in Zhenhai County. The Ningbo Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has instructed all subordinate counties to universally promote it.

    The rice planting boat is three chi long, one chi wide, and weighs only four to five jin. A wooden board is horizontally installed in the middle of the boat as a seat, and a wooden board is nailed upright behind the board to provide a backrest. This type of rice planting boat has been used with good results.

    插秧船
    本报讯　一种能提高插秧工作效率一倍以上、又能减轻体力劳动的插秧船，已在广西僮族自治区横县各地推广使用。截至4月7日的不完全统计，全县就造了一千八百九十多只。
    当地有些妇女称这种插秧船为“翻身船”。船上有一块坐板，插秧时就坐在这块板上，脚手放在外边，插累了，还可以靠着坐板上竖起的一块木板歇一歇。竖起的木板顶端，可以撑上伞或竹笠、蓑衣，晚上可以挂上灯。有了这种船，插秧人就再也不会插得腰酸腿痛头发晕了。
    船的两头，一头放粪，一头放秧，放的数量比秧盆放的多，所以又能减少插秧人来回取粪取秧的时间。
    这种船是用三分厚的薄板造成，全身重量只有十二斤到十五斤。它在田里一般入土只有二公分深，行动起来并不困难。只需插秧人坐在上面，两脚往泥里一蹬，船身就会向后移去。
    据试验，一个中等技术的插秧手，坐了这种船插秧，一整天插了一亩零四厘田，全部实行小株密植。而最强的插秧手三人没用插秧船，在同一时间内，每人平均只插了六分田。
    插秧船一元五角钱就能做一只，比两个秧盆的价格还要低，如能用旧木料做，价格更低。做法也简单，有一般制作木器知识的人都可以做，一个木工一天可做两只。
    据新华社杭州15日电　浙江省宁波专区在今年早稻插秧中，将普遍使用插秧船插秧。这种插秧船是镇海县枫村乡木业社在最近试制成功的。中共宁波地委指示所属各县普遍推广。
    插秧船长三市尺，宽一市尺，重量只四、五斤。船中部横装一块木板作为坐凳，板后竖钉一块木板，可以靠背。这种插秧船经过使用，效果良好。
