How to Write Accurately, Vividly, and Lively?
Guo Moruo on Matters of Writing Style

(Our Dispatch) Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, recently made a statement to the editorial department of "New Observer" magazine regarding the issue of writing style. Guo Moruo said: Writing style is not merely a matter of language; it is primarily a matter of ideology and methodology. He stated that writing is the expression of thought, and thought is the backbone and core of "writing." How can articles be written accurately, vividly, and lively? Guo Moruo said: First, it depends on the writer's thought, standpoint, and style. If your thought is correct, your attitude is clear-cut, and your style is upright, then the articles you write will possess a certain degree of accuracy and clarity. This is a fundamental issue.

Secondly, there is the issue of technique in the articles themselves. Writing involves certain techniques. To write well, one probably needs to understand a bit of logic, grammar, and rhetoric. The purpose of writing is for others to read, not for yourself, so it cannot be that only you understand; the main thing is to make others understand. To express your thoughts and communicate them to others, you yourself must first have accurate concepts and insights, and then express them truthfully. The objective things you see should be made as if unseen people also see them vividly before their eyes. And to achieve this, one must, of course, understand a bit of logic and grammar, because what is illogical is incomprehensible, and what is ungrammatical is also incomprehensible.

Guo Moruo said that being honest is a good way to achieve accuracy. There's no need to painstakingly embellish things. Logic and grammar are, in fact, honest methods. We rarely say incomprehensible things in ordinary speech. This is because we are honest when speaking, saying whatever comes to mind. But when writing, painstaking effort and contrived embellishment often backfire.

To make an article lively, I think a secret is to use fewer adjectives. Some articles now have a problem: they love to pile up adjectives, and they always love to use superlative adjectives.

As for vividness, in general, as long as it is accurate, it is probably also vivid. In addition, for an article to be vivid, one probably has to put some effort into selecting words and phrases. Don't choose obscure, foreign-style terms. Articles like those of Hu Feng and Feng Xuefeng are incomprehensible to read. Sentence structure should be straightforward and conform to the general rules of Chinese language. There's a secret to using words: choose ready-made words with clear concepts, don't look for overly obscure words; obscure words are not clear, and people don't easily understand them; it's best to avoid ambiguous words—words that can be interpreted in one way or another. Using clear rather than ambiguous words to express oneself can achieve a vivid effect.

Liveliness is the same. If sentences are shorter, chapters are shorter, the article becomes more lively and vigorous.

Whether it is accuracy, vividness, or liveliness, from the linguistic point of view, the requirement is that words must always be used appropriately. In this way, the concepts expressed will be accurate, and people will feel the vividness.

When discussing the relationship between writing style and ideology and methodology, Guo Moruo said: Writing style is also closely related to ideology and methodology. Logic, dialectical materialism, etc., are all methods of thinking. If the line of thought is not clear, one simply cannot write a good article. What is illogical is incomprehensible. As for dialectics, it is a higher-level logic, the so-called dialectical logic, which looks at problems more comprehensively from the perspective of development, connection, and essence, making thinking more logical.

You must first have such an embryo—thought and methodology—before you can enter the second step—expressing it with appropriate form and language. Linguistically speaking, it can serve any class, but if your thought is bourgeois, what your language expresses will inevitably be within the category of bourgeois thought, and vice versa. This fully proves that the issue of writing style is not merely a matter of language.

Thought and language have a certain connection; this is the relationship between content and form. Content determines form. The language chosen through proletarian thought must be close to the proletariat. We can find the tools that can accurately express our thoughts from the living language of the proletariat. To write good articles, the main thing is to strive to harmoniously unify content and form. With the changing times, language is gradually changing, and writing style is also changing accordingly. Therefore, the issue of writing style is not merely a matter of language; it has a close relationship with thought and methodology.

Guo Moruo spoke of Chairman Mao's articles, saying: Chairman Mao's articles, as the saying goes, "the writing is like the person"—very approachable. Everyone can understand and likes to read Chairman Mao's articles and speeches. His articles and speeches are simply approachable. What Chairman Mao says is very accurate, telling you clearly what he wants to say. Chairman Mao's articles are very lively and vivid. Even very profound issues in thought and content become very easy to understand under Chairman Mao's pen and in his words. This is what we often call going from the profound to the simple. When we study Chairman Mao's articles, we must learn his approachability, learn his going from the profound to the simple, and learn his ability to express profound thoughts accurately, vividly, and lively.

When studying Chairman Mao's articles, it is necessary to study his approachability, his going from the profound to the simple, his accurate concepts, his vivid images, and his lively style. There is also something more important: to learn from Chairman Mao's character. Only by diligently training in thought and methodology can one write good articles.

Regarding the length of articles, he said: Articles are always "long when there is something to say, and short when there is nothing to say." If there is much to say, it is longer; if there is not much to say, it is shorter. I prefer short articles, but I am not opposed to long articles.

The best article is to use the most economical way to say what you want to say. The so-called "concise language without prolixity." Remove unnecessary words. Of course, not to mention unnecessary sentences, chapters, and sections. Such articles will be welcomed and have the potential to become good articles.

The value of an article is not in its length but in its content. If the content has weight, even if the article is short, it has weight; if the content has no weight, even if it is written as long as the Great Wall, it still has no weight. Therefore, one cannot overwhelm people with quantity; one must pay attention to quality. Writing lengthy and boring articles with no content is a criminal act today, wasting one's own time, wasting paper, wasting the time of typesetters, and wasting the time of all readers. The fault is indeed not small!

He said: Being concise and having content is the way to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical. "More" means more people understand, not more words; "faster" means understanding quickly; "better" means the content is good; "more economical" means everyone saves time.

Let me say it again, I am not opposed to long articles, especially when writing about major issues or major theories, which must be long. But even if you have to write a long article, you must adhere to the principle of economy, making it long when it should be long and short when it should be short.

    怎样把文章写得准确、鲜明、生动？
    郭沫若谈文风问题
    本报讯　中国科学院院长、中国文联主席郭沫若最近对“新观察”杂志编辑部作了关于文风问题的谈话。郭沫若说：文风不单纯是语言问题，主要还是思想方法问题。他说，写文章是表达思想，思想是“文”的骨干和核心。怎样才能使文章写的准确、鲜明、生动呢？郭沫若说：首先要看写文章的人的思想、立场、作风怎样。你的思想正确、态度鲜明、作风正派，那么，你写的文章也就有一定的准确性和鲜明性。这是基本问题。
    其次，是文章本身的技巧问题。写文章有一定的技巧。要使文章写得好，恐怕总得懂一点逻辑、文法和修辞。写文章的目的是给人家看的，不是给你自己看的，所以不能只有你自己懂，主要是要使人家懂。要把你的思想表达出来，传达给别人，你自己先要有准确的概念和见解，然后如实地表达出来。你所看到的客观事物，总要使得没有看到的人也浑如在眼前。而要做到这样，当然要懂得一点逻辑和文法，因为不合逻辑就不通，不合文法也就不通。
    郭沫若说，老实一点，是做到准确的好办法。不一定要苦心孤诣地去修饰。逻辑和文法，其实也就是老老实实的方法。我们平常讲话很少讲不通的话。这是因为讲话时老实，有什么就讲什么。可是写起文章来，苦心孤诣地一经营，往往弄巧反拙。
    要使文章生动，我想少用形容词是一个秘诀。现在有些文章有个毛病，就是爱堆砌形容词，而且总是爱用最高级的形容词。
    对于鲜明，在一般情况下，只要是准确的，大概也是鲜明的。另外，文章要具有鲜明性，恐怕在选择词句、字眼上面还得用一点心。不要选用深奥的外国式的词句，像胡风、冯雪峰那样的文章，看了就是不懂。句法构成要老实一点，要合乎中国话的一般规律。用字有个秘诀，就是选现成的概念明确的字，不要找太偏僻的字；偏僻的字不明确，人家也不容易懂；含糊的——这样可以解释、那样也可以解释的字最好避而不用。用明确的而不是模棱两可的字来表达，就可以收到鲜明的效果。
    生动性也一样。要是句子短些，章节短些，文章就生动活泼。
    无论准确也好，鲜明、生动也好，就语言方面讲，要求字眼总要用得适如其量。这样，表现的概念才会准确，也才能使人感到鲜明。
    在谈到文风同思想方法的关系时，郭沫若说：文风同思想方法关系也是很密切的。像逻辑、唯物辩证法等都是思想方法，如果思路不通，也断断写不出好文章。不合逻辑就是不通。至于辩证法，那是更高一级的逻辑，即所谓辩证逻辑，它是更全面地从发展上、联系上和本质上来看问题，使思想更有逻辑性。
    你总先要有这样的胚子——思想和思想方法，然后才能进入第二步——用适当的形式和语言把它表达出来。就语言讲，它可以为任何阶级服务，但如果你的思想是资产阶级思想，你的语言所表达出来的东西决脱离不了资产阶级思想的范畴，反之亦是。这就充分证明文风问题不单纯是语言问题。
    思想和语言有一定的关联，这是内容和形式的关系。内容决定形式。通过无产阶级思想选用的语言，一定是接近于无产阶级的。我们可以从无产阶级的有生命的语言中，找到能够准确地表达我们思想的工具。要做好文章，主要的要努力把内容和形式和谐地统一起来。随着时代的不同，语言在逐渐的改变，文风也在跟着转变。所以文风问题不是单纯的语言问题，它同思想和思想方法有密切的关系。
    郭沫若谈到毛主席的文章，他说：毛主席的文章，正如开头所说的“文如其人”——非常平易近人。主席的文章和他讲话一样，谁都看得懂，而且喜欢看。他的文章和讲话就是平易近人。毛主席说的话非常准确，想说什么就明明白白的告诉你。毛主席的文章很生动，很形象化，思想内容很艰深的问题，到了毛主席的笔下和嘴里，就变得非常容易懂。这也就是我们常说的深入浅出，我们学习毛主席的文章，就要学习他的平易近人，学习他的深入浅出，学习他准确、鲜明、生动地表达艰深思想的能力。
    学习毛主席的文章，要学习他的平易近人、深入浅出、概念准确、形象鲜明、笔调生动，这些都是必要的。还有一个更重要的，就是学习毛主席的为人。只有在思想和思想方法上经过苦心的锻炼，才能把文章写得好。
    关于文章的长短，他说：文章总是“有话即长，无话则短”。要说的东西多，就长一点；说的东西不多，就短一点。我是喜欢短文章的，但我也并不反对长文章。
    文章最好是用最经济的办法，把你想说的东西说出来。所谓“要言不繁”。把可有可无的字去掉。当然，更不用说可有可无的句、章、节了。这样的文章才会受欢迎，才有可能成为好文章。
    文章不在长短，要看内容如何。内容有分量，尽管文章短小，也是有分量的；如果内容没有分量，尽管写得像万里长城那样长，还是没有分量。所以不能用量压人，要讲求质。写毫无内容的冗长不堪的文章，在今天来说，是一种犯罪的行为，浪费自己的时间不说，还浪费了纸张，浪费了排字工人的时间，浪费了所有读者的时间，过失实在不小！
    他说：简短，又有内容，就可以多、快、好、省。多是懂的人多，不是文字多；快是懂得快；好是内容好；省是大家省时间。
    让我再说一遍，我是并不反对长文章的，尤其是要写重大的问题或重大的理论，那是非长不可的。但即使必须写长文章，也要遵守经济的原则，应当长就长，应当短就短。
