Yangtian Cooperative Seeks Ways to Ensure Dense Planting

    According to a report in the New Hunan Daily: Under the slogan "Everything for transplanting, everything for dense planting," the Yangtian Cooperative in Dayao Township, Liuyang, organized debates to ensure that everyone truly accepted new technologies such as dense planting ideologically. They also adopted measures such as formulating operational procedures for dense planting, carrying out reforms of tools and farming methods, comprehensively arranging agricultural work before transplanting, and making various preparations to solve the two major contradictions of insufficient cattle power and insufficient labor, ensuring the completion of transplanting work before and after Grain Rain.

    New Situation This Year – Early, New, More
    Due to the implementation of technological innovations, there are many new situations in transplanting this year, which are generally reflected in three aspects: "early," "new," and "more." "Early" means that the season has been advanced, with the cooperative's transplanting being half a month to twenty days earlier than usual. The advancement of the season highlights the increased need for cattle power. This year, about 70% of the cooperative's paddy fields (712 mu) were planted with grass seedlings, and the grass must be turned over before Grain Rain, and transplanting must take place around Qingming, with only half a month in between, halving the time compared to previous years. At the same time, it is required to perform three plowings and five harrowings, doubling the plowing and harrowing work compared to previous years, making the need for cattle power even more pressing. The cooperative calculated that the 47 cattle capable of labor would each have to bear 15-20 cattle workdays before transplanting, and if no solutions were found, they would be overwhelmed. "New" means that a new set of technologies must be implemented, which the masses are not accustomed to or familiar with, so technical guidance must be strengthened as soon as possible. "More" means that more work is required, leading to labor shortages. This year's 4x4 inch dense planting requires 30-36 work points per mu, and applying base fertilizer requires 20 work points per mu, more than double the past. According to the requirements for increased production, transplanting must be advanced and shortened, requiring each workday to complete 19 work points. Recognizing these new situations, Yangtian Cooperative began to carry out work in many aspects.

    Combining Reasoning with Solving Practical Problems
    In mobilizing the masses to raise their thinking, Yangtian Cooperative's experience is to combine reasoning with solving practical problems. Initially, a large portion of the cooperative's members doubted that dense planting could increase production, worried about the inconvenience of work, fearing difficulties in transplanting, applying fertilizer, weeding, and lodging. The cooperative successively carried out three discussions among the masses, combined with the formulation of production plans, the implementation of the "three guarantees and five assignments to the field," and the recent research on transplanting preparation work, launched extensive debates among cadres and members. They used typical cases of dense planting increasing production and accounting methods to publicize the benefits of dense planting. At the same time, they solved some practical problems: for example, in transplanting, they created the "eight, eight, four seedling cluster spacing" method, which can overcome the inconvenience of applying fertilizer and inter-tillage; strengthened training to enable the masses to master the technology; and improved tools such as row markers, inter-tillage tools, and fertilizer boats to improve work efficiency. Now, a large portion of the masses have accepted it ideologically. The argument of "sparse seedlings yielding large grains" has been transformed into the public opinion of "more planting, more grain."

    Formulating Operational Procedures for Dense Planting
    The cooperative relied on the masses to formulate operational procedures for dense planting and earnestly implement them among the masses.

    1. Transplanting time: Start full transplanting three to four days before Grain Rain and complete it within twelve days. First transplant the bare fields, then the grass seedling fields, and finally the rape fields. 2. Dense planting: Promote the "eight, eight, four seedling cluster spacing" method: (as shown in the figure below) Plant four clusters on the left, plant four clusters across the center, plant four clusters on the right.

    The benefits of this planting method are that it can fully utilize the land, allowing for more than 32,000 clusters to be planted per mu, and it is convenient for transplanting and inter-tillage. When planting, separate your feet and step on the eight-inch wide footpath, plant four clusters on the left, four clusters on the right, and four clusters across the center.

    3. Modify the row marker to suit the "eight, eight, four seedling cluster spacing" so that the row and plant spacing can be marked at once.

    4. Number of seedlings per cluster: five to seven, and the division of seedlings must be accurate.

    5. Requirements for "four no-nos in transplanting": no transplanting of tobacco leaves, five-finger seedlings, seedlings of uneven height, and floating seedlings.

    In order to improve work efficiency, adopt the method of transplanting by advancing in a "zigzag" path. With the left foot behind, first transplant four rows on the left (four clusters per row), transplant two rows across the center, and do not transplant on the right; when the left foot moves forward and the right foot is behind, transplant four rows on the right and two rows across the center.

    6. Apply 30 dan of base fertilizer per mu, which was previously a handful of fertilizer per seedling cluster, applied an inch away from the seedling cluster, but this year it has been changed to applying it in the center of four seedling clusters.

    In order to enable the masses to master the technology and become familiar with the operation, cadres of the cooperative and skilled transplanters are being organized for training, and the above operational procedures are being discussed among the masses. At the same time, a live training session is being prepared so that everyone can learn transplanting techniques.

    Do a Good Job of Various Tasks Before Transplanting

    1. Do a good job of protecting seedlings to ensure that they do not rot. At the same time, seize the opportunity to apply fertilizer to promote seedling growth. After the seedlings turn green, apply urea and ash once, and then apply it every three to five days, so that the field does not wait for the seedlings and the seedlings do not wait for the field. 2. Catch up on the work before transplanting to ensure that the season is not missed. During the major inspection on March 20, it was found that there was a shortage of fertilizer and cattle power. From the 22nd, a patriotic fertilizer accumulation and seedling cultivation campaign was launched to eliminate fertilizer-free fields, apply sufficient fertilizer to fields with insufficient fertilizer, and develop a reasonable fertilization plan. Three measures were taken for plowing and harrowing: cattle should not rest, start work early and finish work late, doing one and a half days' work in one day; improve plowing tools, and promote improved harrows and plows; and rationally arrange the grass turning period for grass seedling fields. At the same time, the plowing and harrowing work is contracted to individuals, achieving defined people, defined cattle, defined fields, defined time, defined work points, and defined quality. In order to ensure that cattle work full shifts, feeding management has been strengthened. 3. Find every possible way to improve work efficiency and overcome labor shortages. The first is to carry out a mass tool reform movement, calling on everyone to contribute ideas, with cadres taking the lead. Propose the slogan: bold ideals, active creation, dare to think and dare to act, successful promotion, and failure summary. At present, row markers and inter-tillage tools have been improved, fertilizer applicators are also being researched, and improvements to transportation conditions are also underway. Secondly, rationally arrange labor, organize transplanting teams, and contract transplanting and fertilizer application work to teams, with full labor transplanting at night and half labor applying fertilizer during the day. Thirdly, increase the attendance rate, help women arrange their housework, organize baby-holding groups, and strive for all 290 women to work; the cooperative has 18 single men, and they are mobilized to share meals to save cooking time. The above three items can save or supplement a total of more than 30,000 work points, which can basically solve the labor shortage. 4. Do a good job of material preparation. This year, it is planned to promote Xihengtian lime, and 100,000 jin have been ordered, which are planned to be transported back recently; carpenters are being organized to rush to make row markers and fertilizer boats, and members are mobilized to prepare enough raincoats and straw hats, and the cooperative is preparing baskets, base fertilizer, etc.; Several special fields, such as seed retention fields, experimental fields, and high-yield fields, have been properly arranged.

    翻转旧脑筋  赶上新形势
    阳田社想方设法保证密植
    本报讯　据新湖南报消息：浏阳大瑶乡阳田社在“一切为了插秧、一切为了密植”的口号下，一方面组织辩论，使每个人从思想上真正接受密植等新技术，一方面采取制订密植插秧操作规程、开展工具和耕作方法的改革，全面安排插秧前的农活，作好各项准备，以解决牛力不足和劳力不足的两大矛盾，保证在谷雨前后完成插秧工作。
    今年的新情况——早、新、多
    由于实行技术革新，今年插秧有许多新的情况，总起来表现在“早”“新”“多”三个方面：“早”，就是季节提早了，该社插秧比常年提早半个月到二十天。季节的提早，突出的是增加了对牛力的需要。今年全社约70％的稻田（七百一十二亩）种了草子，谷雨前插秧，清明前后就要倒草，中间相距只半个月，比往年缩短一半时间；同时要求作到三犁五耙，犁耙工夫比往年增加一倍，牛力更加感到不够。全社算了一笔大账，能劳役的四十七头牛，每头耕牛插秧前每天要负担十五——二十分牛工，如不想办法，就吃不消。“新”，就是要实行一套新技术，群众不习惯不熟悉，必须及早加强技术指导。“多”，就是工夫加多了，带来了劳力的紧张。今年4×4寸密植，每亩需工三十——三十六分，插安蔸灰每亩要二十分，比过去增加一倍以上，而按增产要求，又必须提早和缩短插秧时间，每个工作日要完成十九分工。认清了这些新的情况，阳田社着手进行了多方面的工作。
    讲道理与解决实际问题相结合
    在发动群众提高思想方面，阳田社的经验是：讲道理和解决实际问题相结合。该社社员起初有很大一部分人怀疑密植能够增产，顾虑工作不方便，怕不好插秧、不好点灰、不好薅禾和青风倒伏等。全社在群众中先后开展了三次讨论，结合订生产计划、推行“三包五到丘”，以及最近关于插秧准备工作的研究，在干部和社员中展开了广泛的辩论。用密植增产的典型事例和算账的办法，宣传密植的好处。与此同时，解决了一些实际的问题：例如在插秧上，创造了“八、八、四蔸跨”的办法，能克服插灰、中耕的不便；加强训练，使群众掌握技术；改进划行器、中耕器、灰船等工具，提高工效。现在很大一部分群众从思想上接受下来了。“稀禾结大谷”的论调变成了“多栽多结谷”的舆论。
        制订密植插秧的操作规程
    该社依靠群众制订了密植插秧的操作规程，切实贯彻到群众中去。
    一、插秧时间：谷雨前三——四天开始全面插秧、十二天内插完。先插光板田，再插草子田，后插油麦子田。二、密植：推广“八、八、四蔸跨”的方法：（如下图）左插四蔸　跨下插四蔸　右插四蔸
    这种插法的好处是，既能充分利用地力，每亩可插三万二千多蔸；又便于插秧和中耕。插时，两脚分开踩在宽八寸的人行道上，左插四蔸，右插四蔸，跨下插四蔸。
    三、改制适合“八八四蔸跨”的划行器，一次将株行距划好。
    四、插秧根数，每蔸五——七根，分秧要准确。
    五、要求“四不插”：不插烟袋脑、五抓禾、袍套子（高低长短不齐）、浮蔸子。
    为了提高工效，采用走“之”字路前进插秧的方法，左脚在后，就先在左边插四行（每行四蔸），中跨下插2行，右边不插；左脚向前，右脚在后，即在右边插四行，中跨下插二行。
    六、安蔸灰每亩插三十担，过去是每蔸禾一抓，插在距禾蔸寸多远的地方，今年改插在四蔸禾的中央。
    为了让群众掌握技术，熟悉操作，正组织社队干部和插秧能手进行训练，再在群众中讨论上述的操作规程，同时准备组织一次现场训练，以便人人学会插秧技术。
            做好插秧前的各项工作
    一、做好护秧工作，保证不烂秧。同时抓住了追肥催秧，转青后追施一次尿窖灰，以后每隔三——五天追一次，做到田不等秧、秧不等田。二、把插秧前的工夫赶上来，保证不误季节。3月20日大检查时发现肥料不足和牛工紧张。从22日起，即开展了一个爱国积肥、育秧翻田突击运动，决心消灭无肥田，少肥田下足粪，并订出了合理施肥规划。犁耙工夫采取三项措施：牛不歇，出早工收晚工，一天做天半的事；改进犁田工具，推广改良耙、改良犁；合理安排草子田的倒草期。同时将犁耙工夫包到人，做到定人、定牛、定田、定时间、定工分、定质量。为了保证耕牛出满勤，加强了饲养管理。三、想一切办法提高工效，克服劳力不足困难。首先是开展群众性的工具改革运动，号召人人献计，干部带头。提出口号：大胆理想，积极创造，敢想敢作，成功推广，失败总结。目前已改进的有划行器和中耕器等，插灰器也正在研究中，改进运输条件也在动手。其次，合理安排劳力，组织插秧小组，把插秧和点灰工夫进行小组包工，晚上扯白天插，全劳力插秧，半劳力点灰。第三、提高出工率，帮助妇女安排好家务，组织抱娃娃组，争取二百九十个妇女全部出工；全社有十八个单身汉，动员他们搭伙食，省出煮饭时间。以上三项可以节省或补充的工分共三万多分，基本上能解决劳力不足的困难。四、做好物资准备。今年计划推广下横田石灰，已定购了十万斤，打算最近运回；正组织木匠赶制划行器和灰船，发动社员备足蓑衣斗笠，社里备齐管箕、安蔸灰等；有几种特殊田，如留种田、试验田、丰产田等均一一作了妥善安排。　（阳田社驻社工作组）
