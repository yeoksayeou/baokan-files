    My Weekend in Beijing
    By Wu Lamau, Burmese Ambassador to China
    Since arriving in Beijing seven years ago – this beautiful and solemn city – I have lived every day and every moment very happily. Everywhere is filled with new and exciting sights, surrounded by the atmosphere of Asia. Among these simple and friendly Chinese friends, I do not feel homesick, but feel warmth and kindness.
    My four children, known in Beijing diplomatic circles as mischievous monkeys, have fallen in love with this new environment just like me. They no longer need to go to restaurants to eat the world-famous Chinese food, as they did in Rangoon. This alone is enough to satisfy them. However, as the days and months fly by, their desire for new knowledge and new experiences has gradually increased. At first, it was not difficult to arrange everything, because Beijing has many historical sites. Every weekend, my wife and I would take them either to the Summer Palace or the Temple of Heaven; or this time to Beihai Park, next time to the Forbidden City. They were not only intoxicated by the beautiful scenery and historical sites, but also sparked their interest in exploring the historical figures related to these places of interest. They kept asking questions, making my wife and I busy answering them. But after they had repeatedly visited these places in every season of spring, summer, autumn and winter, my four little monkeys clamored to go to places they had never been to. At this time, my wife suggested that it would be better to take them to see the greenhouses and nurseries to cultivate their habit of loving flowers and living things. From then on, we often spent a weekend afternoon in Longfusi Temple or the greenhouses and nurseries outside the city. They patiently listened to experienced old florists telling us how to propagate, graft, and kill insects. They were very excited to plant the flower seeds they bought back in the embassy's garden. Each person was busy watering, fertilizing, and pruning their own small plot. When they became more familiar with it, they surrounded me and asked, "Dad! How should we spend this weekend?" Poor me, scratching my head and racking my brains to think: "How to spend this weekend?" Fortunately, often before I could answer, they had already announced the good news they had inquired about: "This weekend, Yonghe Temple is holding a ghost-beating festival," "Fragrant Hills has opened," "Guangji Temple has a Buddha tooth," "Tanzhe Temple has an emperor tree."
    Speaking of emperor trees, it reminds me of how excited they were when they found a ginkgo tree in the garden after they came back from Tanzhe Temple. When they saw a new branch coming out, the four little monkeys said to me very dejectedly: "Dad! The Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs is probably going to send a new ambassador to Beijing." Unexpectedly, in winter, the newly emerged tender branches withered. They jumped up and shouted happily: "Dad! Mom! We won't leave Beijing!"
    A month ago, I returned from Myanmar on official business, and the four children immediately surrounded me and asked, "Dad! How are we going to spend this weekend?" Although still trapped in the fatigue of the journey, my wife and I were unwilling to disappoint these four little monkeys who had been hibernating for a while. We put our heads together to think of places to go. One little monkey just suggested going to Lugou Bridge to shoot ducks, and the other three immediately responded. But my wife, a most devout Buddhist, one can easily imagine how much she opposed this idea of ​​killing. Caught between two camps, I didn't know which side to stand on. Finally, the children said: "Mom! Don't you think it's shameful for a man not to even know how to hold a gun?" So, I persuaded their mother to go hunting at Lugou Bridge on the grounds of teaching the children how to hold a gun and shoot targets. There we met a Chinese friend who told us that in one place we could hunt goats and pheasants. Like adding fuel to the fire, the children immediately rushed to me and said, "Dad! Let's go there next weekend!" Coincidentally, that day was Pakistan's National Day, and I thought this was a good excuse. Unexpectedly, they said: "Dad! Didn't your diplomatic corps decide not to hold any banquets on weekends?" To be honest, I really thank that colleague who made this suggestion. Because this decision solved many family problems for me. Of course, this time it was Pakistan's National Day, so it could not be regarded as a normal banquet. But the four little monkeys said they could get up at four or five in the morning and rush back in the afternoon. As a result, none of the reasons I gave could dispel their enthusiasm for going.
    On that Sunday, before the sun had even appeared, I, the children, and that Chinese friend set off. After driving along the railway for two hours, we arrived at the picturesque Kou'er Village. After walking a distance, we saw the towering mountain in front of us. There were not many trees, but they faintly revealed green. The four little monkeys were climbing like fish in water. But me, I was only halfway up the mountain when my legs hurt, my back ached, and I couldn't move an inch. At this time, I realized that I was no longer the young and strong La Mao who had climbed many mountains and crossed the Myanmar-Thailand border for Myanmar's independence. I am approaching old age, and the days of jumping and bouncing have become a thing of the past. I sighed and stopped, letting the energetic children continue to move forward.
    At this time, my Chinese friend thoughtfully took my thick coat and let me rest. After a while, he even asked a local resident for a pot of boiling water and poured me a cup to quench my thirst, truly like a traveler in the desert getting nectar. I drank it all in one gulp and immediately felt relaxed. By a waterfall that had congealed into ice pillars, I knew that struggling was just a foolish attempt, and no matter how high your aspirations, you could not break free from the shackles that age gave you. I groped my way down the mountain. My calves were constantly trembling, and I felt that it was even more difficult than going up the mountain. If it weren't for the walking stick given to me by my enthusiastic driver, I would have been unable to return to where the car was parked.
    Adults and children surrounded the car, looking at me with curious eyes. I said to them in Chinese: "How are you?" They also greeted me with warm smiles. At this time, a staff member came over and very politely and respectfully asked me to sit in his house, and said to me: "I often see your name in the newspaper, especially when Premier U Nu visited China." We talked like two old friends who had been reunited after a long separation. He told me about the population of this village and how advanced the cooperative here was. I also took out the beer I had brought and toasted him. Probably noticing my fatigue, he persuaded the people around him to disperse and let me rest. I soon fell asleep, whether from the alcohol or exhaustion. When I woke up, I found my new friend holding a piece of paper and saying to me: "I used to be illiterate, but I only started learning culture after liberation. Ambassador! This is what I wrote for you."
    Unfortunately, I can only understand Chinese but cannot read Chinese characters, so he read it himself: "Dear Ambassador Wu Lamau, please forgive me for being illiterate. The wine you gave me is the long flowing water of peace between the people of China and Myanmar. May the people of China and Myanmar live forever, and may the Ambassador be healthy. Written by Lei Zhong. March 23rd."
    The emotion I felt was indescribable, I could only raise my glass to him again and say: "This is for the eternal friendship between China and Myanmar!"
    More and more people surrounded us, and when I said goodbye to them, I still heard him patiently answering the people next to him: "This is the Burmese Ambassador", "Myanmar, our friend to the southwest", "It is a great honor for him to come here to us." So adults and children followed us as we started the car, running and waving their hands, shouting: "Welcome you to come again! Welcome you to come again!"
    With emotion and reluctance, I temporarily bid farewell to these dear new friends. Lingering in my mind were those sincere and friendly faces, and echoing in my ears were the voices of the villagers telling us where the goats were. Although this was not the first time I had come to the Chinese countryside, I had been to many places in China with the Myanmar delegation. But this was the first time I had come into their daily lives, made unrestrained and natural contact with them, and heard their unadorned heartfelt words. I felt that from that moment on, the friendship of the Chinese people was more deeply engraved in my heart.
    Looking at the men, women, and children outside the car who temporarily stopped working and waved to us, I couldn't help but think: "How many Lei Zhongs are there among them! How many men and women were exploited and oppressed before liberation, but today they are happily and carefree building their motherland."
    My thoughts were suddenly interrupted by the voices of the children. It was still the same question: "Dad! How are we going to spend next weekend?"
    This time I replied without needing to think: "Children! There are places all over Beijing where we can spend weekends that are as meaningful as today."

### 我在北京的周末

    我在北京的周末
    缅甸联邦驻中国大使　吴拉茂
    自从七年前我来到北京——这个美丽庄严的城市，每一天每一个时辰我都是非常愉快地生活着。到处充满着新的令人兴奋的景象，四周洋溢着亚洲人的气息。在这些纯朴、友爱的中国朋友当中，我没有乡愁，感到的是亲切和温暖。
    我的四个孩子，在北京外交界以猴子闻名的小淘气，和我一样爱上了这个新的环境。他们不再需要像在仰光时那样非上馆子才吃得到举世闻名的中国菜。单这一点他们就够感到满足的了。可是随着飞逝的日月，他们追求新的知识新的见闻的要求也逐渐增长。起初是不难安排一切的，因为北京有许多古迹名胜。每到周末，我和我的妻总带着他们不是到颐和园，就是天坛；或者这一次到北海，下一次到故宫。他们不仅陶醉在那优美的风景和古迹里，更触起他们探讨有关这些名胜古迹的历史人物的兴趣。他们叨叨不休的问这问那，使我和我的妻忙不过来回答。但是在春夏秋冬每一个季节里他们都反复游玩过这些地方后，我的四个小猴子就嚷嚷着要到他们不曾去过的地方。这时候我的妻建议说不如带他们去看看花房苗圃，培养他们爱花爱生物的习性。从此我们常把一个周末的下午消磨在隆福寺，或是城外的花房苗圃里。他们耐心地听有经验的老花匠给我们说怎样繁殖，怎样剪接，怎样杀虫。他们很兴奋地把买回来的花种到使馆的园子里。各人忙着为自己的一片小园地浇水、施肥、修剪。等他们比较熟悉了一些，又围着我一步不放地问：“爹！我们怎样消磨这个周末啊？”可怜的我，抓头搔耳，绞尽脑汁地想：“怎样打发这个周末呢？”好的是常常不等我回答，他们已经把探听来的好消息宣布了：“这个周末，雍和宫举行打鬼节”，“香山已经开放了”，“广济寺有佛牙”，“潭柘寺有帝王树”。
    说起帝王树，使我想起他们由潭柘寺回来后在园子里发现了一颗银杏是多么兴奋。当他们看见一个新枝发出来的时候，四个小猴子很颓丧地对我说：“爹！缅甸外交部大概要派一个新的大使来北京了。”不料冬天的时候，新抽出的嫩枝枯萎了。他们跳起来，高兴地喊到：“爹！妈！我们不会离开北京了！”
    一个月以前我因公去缅甸归来，四个孩子马上围上来盯着问：“爹！怎样度过这个周末啊？”虽然还困在旅行的疲惫里，我和妻都不愿叫这四个冬眠了一阵的小猴子失望。我们一同动脑筋，想可以去的地方。一个小猴子刚提议去芦沟桥打鸭子，另外三个立刻响应。可是我的妻，一个最虔诚的佛教徒，大家不难想像她是多么反对这个杀生的念头。我夹在两个阵营之间，不知该站在哪一边。最后孩子们说：“妈妈！你不觉得身为男子汉连枪都不会拿是可耻的吗？”于是我以教孩子们拿枪打靶为理由说服了他们的母亲动身去芦沟桥打猎。在那儿我们结识了一个中国朋友，他告诉我们在一个地方可以打山羊和野鸡。正像在火上加了油，孩子们立刻扑到我跟前说，“爹！下个周末让我们到那儿去吧！”正巧那天是巴基斯坦的国庆，我想这是一个很好的借口。不料他们说：“爹！你们外交使团不是决定在周末不举行任何宴会吗？”说实话，我真感谢那位提出这个建议的同僚。因为这个决定解决了我不少家庭问题。当然这一次是巴基斯坦的国庆日，不可能照一般的宴会看待。但是四个小猴子说可以在早晨四、五点起身，下午再赶回来。结果我所举出的理由都无法打消他们去的热情。
    星期日那天，太阳还未露面的时候，我和孩子还有那位中国朋友就动身了。沿着铁路奔驰了两小时，来到一个风景优美的口儿村。走上一段路就见到耸立在面前的山头。树木不多，却隐隐约约地透出了青绿。四个小猴子正像如鱼得水一股劲地爬着。可是我，才到了半山就腿疼，腰酸，寸步难行。这时候我才体会到我已经不再是那个为缅甸独立而爬过许多山岭、穿过缅泰边境的年青力壮的拉茂了。我已经走近衰迈的老年，跳跳蹦蹦的日子已经成了往事。我感叹地停了脚步，让精力充沛的孩子继续前进。
    这时候，我的中国朋友体贴地把我的厚外衣接了过去让我休息。不一会他更从附近的住户要了一壶开水，倒了一杯给我解渴，真如同沙漠里的跋涉者得到了甘露。我一饮而尽，顿时感到了轻松。在一个已凝成冰柱的瀑布边，我知道挣扎只是愚蠢的尝试，任凭你有山高的志愿，也挣不开年岁所给你的桎梏。我摸索着向山下走。腿肚不停的颤抖，觉得比上山更加艰难。如果不是靠我热诚的司机给我的那根手杖，我是万难回到汽车停着的地方了。
    围在汽车旁边的大人孩子用好奇的眼神望着我。我用中国话和他们说：“你好吗？”他们也用亲热的微笑招呼我。在这时候一个工作人员走过来很客气恭敬地请我去他屋子里坐坐，并且对我说：“我常在报上看见你的名字，尤其在吴努总理来中国访问的时候。”我们像两个久别重逢的老朋友攀谈了起来。他告诉我这个村子的人口和这儿的合作社是如何先进。我也拿出带去的啤酒和他干杯。大概是注意到我的困倦，他劝那些围着的人散开让我休息。不知是酒意还是乏倦，很快就把我带入了梦乡。醒来时，发现我新结识的朋友拿着一张纸，对我说：“以前我是个一字不识的人，是解放以后我才开始学习文化。大使！这是我为你写的。”
    可惜我只听得懂中国话却看不懂中国字，于是他自己念道：“敬爱的吴拉茂大使，请你原谅我是不会写字的人，你给我的酒是中缅两国人民和平的长流水。祝中缅两国人民万岁，祝大使身体健康。雷中写。3月23日”
    我所受的感动是无法形容的，我只能向他再一次举杯道：“这是为中缅友好万岁！”
    包围着我们的人越来越多，在我和他们告别时还听见他耐心地回答旁边的人说：“这是缅甸大使”，“缅甸，我们西南方的朋友”，“他来这儿对我们是很大的光荣。”于是大人孩子都跟着我们开动了，由慢而快的汽车，一面跑一面挥着手喊：“欢迎你再来！欢迎你再来！”
    怀着感动和恋恋不舍的心情，我暂时向这些亲爱的新朋友告别。在我心头盘旋不去的是那一个个真挚友善的脸，在我耳边回绕不散的是老乡们告诉我们山羊在那儿的喊声。虽然这不是我第一次来到中国的乡村，跟着缅甸代表团，我去过中国许许多多的地方。但是这是第一次我来到他们日常的生活当中，和他们做不拘束的自然的接触，听到他们毫不加修饰的心腹话。我感到从那一刹那起，中国人民的友情更深地刻在我的心上了。
    望着车外暂时停住劳动和我们招手的男女老少，我禁不住想：“他们当中会有多少个雷中啊！他们当中有多少男女是在解放前受尽剥削压迫，今天却在欢欢喜喜无忧无虑地建设他们的祖国。”
    我的思潮忽然被孩子们的声音打断了。原来还是那一句话：“爹！我们怎样度过下个周末啊？”
    这次我没有需要思索就答道：“孩子！北京到处都是我们可以度过和今天一样有意义的周末的地方。”
