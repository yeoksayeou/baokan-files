    This newspaper reports that Finn Moe, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Constitutional Committee of the Norwegian Parliament, has been visiting China for nearly a month at the invitation of our country. During this period, Finn Moe visited Shenyang, Anshan, Chongqing, Wuhan, Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places, and visited various construction and education works in China's industry and agriculture. A few days ago, this reporter visited Finn Moe and asked him to talk about his impressions of visiting China.
    He said, "China's tremendous efforts in developing industry and agriculture, and the great achievements made in such a short period of time, have left a particularly deep impression on me." Finn Moe said, "Wherever I go, new factories, buildings, and water conservancy and irrigation projects are being built." He expressed his great admiration for the spirit of Chinese workers and farmers in vigorously increasing production, striving to create, and inventing new tools. He said, "All of this is a great improvement compared to the past." Finn Moe also sincerely hoped that the People's Republic of China would soon obtain its legitimate status in the United Nations.
    In his talk, Finn Moe emphasized that one of the purposes of his visit to China was to contribute to promoting friendship and mutual understanding between the people of China and Norway. He said, "Although our two countries have different political systems and are far apart from each other, we can have friendly relations. I hope to further develop the ties between the two countries in the future, first of all to develop cultural exchanges and economic exchanges." Speaking of this, Finn Moe mentioned the trade agreement between Norway and the Soviet Union approved by the Norwegian Parliament in late March, and said: It would be a very good thing if Norway and China could also sign such a trade agreement.
    The reporter asked Finn Moe to express his views on certain important international issues of the moment. He first talked about the summit meeting, which is of concern to the people of the world. He believes that the summit will be held, and it is necessary to make the meeting a success for world peace. He said, "The meeting must be well prepared, and it is best to start by solving relatively small international problems that are likely to be agreed upon. Because if agreements can be reached on these issues, this will create conditions for further solving those complex international problems." He believes that the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear tests is a good decision, and hopes that this action by the Soviet Union will lead to the conclusion of a broad international agreement. Regarding the decision of the Chinese People's Volunteers to withdraw from Korea, Finn Moe believes that this is a step in the right direction.
    At the end of the visit, Finn Moe once again expressed his friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. He emphasized this point to the reporter: "China is no longer an old China, it has begun a new future." He also stated that he was prepared to write several articles after returning home to introduce the construction situation in the People's Republic of China.

    挪威议会外交、宪法委员会主席
    芬·穆谈中挪两国关系
    本报讯　挪威议会外交、宪法委员会主席芬·穆应邀来我国作客将近一个月。在此期间，芬·穆访问了沈阳、鞍山、重庆、武汉、上海、杭州等地，参观了我国工、农业的各项建设和教育工作。日前，本报记者往访芬·穆，请他谈谈访问我国的观感。
    他说：“中国在发展工农业方面所作的巨大努力，以及在短短的时间内取得这样大的成就给了我特别深刻的印象”。芬·穆说：“不管我到哪里，到处都在建筑新的工厂、大厦和修建水利灌溉工程。”他对于中国工人、农民大力增产、努力创造以及发明新工具的精神表示非常钦佩。他说：“所有这些跟过去比较起来是很大的进步。”芬·穆还真诚地希望不久以后中华人民共和国能够在联合国中取得合法地位。
    芬·穆在谈话中强调了他这次访问中国的目的之一，是希望对促进中国和挪威两国人民的友谊和共同了解有所贡献。他说：“虽然我们两个国家的政治制度不同，彼此距离又遥远，但是我们能够有友好的关系。我希望今后进一步发展两国的联系，首先是发展文化交流和经济来往。”说到这里，芬·穆提到了3月下旬挪威议会批准的挪威和苏联的贸易协定，并且说：如果挪威跟中国也签订这样一个贸易协定，那将是一件很好的事情。
    记者要求芬·穆对当前的某些重要的国际问题发表意见。他首先谈到了世界人民所关心的最高级会议的问题。他认为最高级会议将会举行，为了世界和平必须使会议开得成功。他说：“会议一定要做好准备，最好能从解决比较小的而且有相当可能达成协议的国际问题上开始。因为如果能在这些问题上达成协议，这就为进一步解决那些复杂的国际问题创造了条件。”他认为苏联单方面停止核试验是一个好的决定，而且希望苏联这一行动能导致达成一个广泛的国际协议。对于中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤退的决定，芬·穆认为，这是朝着正确方向的一个步骤。
    在访问结束的时候，芬·穆再一次表示了他对中国人民的友好的感情。他着重向记者提到这一点：“中国不再是一个旧的中国了，它开始了一个新的未来。”他并且表示在回国之后准备写几篇文章来介绍中华人民共和国正在进行的建设的情况。
