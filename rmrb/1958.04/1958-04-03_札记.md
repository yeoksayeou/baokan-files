Notes

    Exposed to the Face
    The United States' propaganda machine has been spreading a rumor that the Soviet Union once supplied weapons to the Indonesian government. At a press conference on April 1, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also tried his best to exaggerate this fabrication as if it were true. When a reporter asked if the United States had obtained intelligence about Soviet aid to the Indonesian government, Dulles immediately said, "Yes, we really have such intelligence."
    It seemed that Dulles had really caught something substantial. However, when reporters further pressed him about what "intelligence" he had obtained, his true colors could not but be revealed. He admitted that it was not the transportation of weapons, but that the Soviet Union had given the Indonesian government a loan, and the Indonesian government used the loan to purchase some Soviet ships.
    But what kind of "intelligence" is this? The fact that the Indonesian government obtained loans and ships from the Soviet Union was announced in newspapers all over the world long ago. The U.S. Secretary of State originally wanted to use this to make groundless accusations and create rumors, but unexpectedly, this clumsy rumor-mongering was exposed on the spot.
    So "Humane"
    After the Soviet Union announced the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at a press conference, spared no effort to describe the nuclear tests that the United States was about to conduct as being for the manufacture of "clean tactical weapons" in order to defend the United States' stubborn attitude of refusing to take the same action, so it was based on "humanity" and "the responsibility and obligations owed to mankind."
    According to Dulles's logic, it seems that not conducting nuclear tests to manufacture "clean" nuclear weapons is not "humane" and not taking "responsibility" for mankind, which is, of course, the standard logic of war-mongers. But even according to this logic, Dulles cannot justify himself. Because, when a reporter asked him whether the United States would still retain those million-ton or thousand-ton dirty bombs in its armory in the future, Dulles was speechless and said, "We are still a long way from considering this issue."
    It can be seen that the war-mongers' "humanity" in the mouths of people like Dulles is also false. All they are thinking about is how to violate humanity to prepare for war.

    札记
    当面揭穿
    美国的宣传机构一直在散播一种谣言，好像是苏联曾经给印度尼西亚政府供应了武器。美国国务卿杜勒斯在4月1日的记者招待会上，也竭力想把这种捏造渲染成若有其事。当记者问美国是不是得到了苏联援助印度尼西亚政府的情报时，杜勒斯马上就说：“有，我们真的有这种情报。”
    看来，杜勒斯真好像抓到了什么真凭实据的样子。可是，当记者再追问他究竟得到了什么“情报”时，他的马脚就不能不露出来了。他承认这不是运送武器，而是苏联给了印度尼西亚政府一笔贷款，以及印度尼西亚政府利用这笔贷款购买了苏联的一些船只。
    可是，这是什么“情报”呢？印度尼西亚政府从苏联得到贷款和船只的事，是早在全世界的报纸公布了的事。美国的这位国务卿原想借此捕风捉影，制造谣言，却不想这种拙劣的造谣手段当面就被揭穿了。
    如此“人道”
    在苏联宣布停止核武器试验后，美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上为了给美国拒绝采取同样行动的顽固态度辩解，不惜把美国将要进行的核试验说成是为了制造“干净的战术武器”，所以是基于“人道”和“对人类应负的责任和义务”。
    按照杜勒斯的逻辑，倒好像不进行核试验来制造“干净”的核武器才是不“人道”和对人类不负“责任”的，这当然是标准的战争贩子的逻辑。可是即使是按照这种逻辑，杜勒斯也是无法自圆其说。因为，当记者问到他将来美国是否在军械库中仍保留那些百万吨级的或千吨级的不干净炸弹的时候，杜勒斯就张口结舌地说：“我们去考虑这个问题的时间还远得很。”
    可见杜勒斯之流口中的那种战争贩子的“人道”也是假的，他们一心想的只是怎样违反人道来准备战争。
