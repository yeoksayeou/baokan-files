Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 12th: U.S. officials said on the 10th that approximately 700 Japanese textile companies went bankrupt last year, and the bankruptcy rate of Japanese textile companies continues to remain high this year.

They said that the bankrupt companies in Japan are not limited to textile companies; a considerable number of other Japanese enterprises that mainly manufacture goods for export trade have also gone bankrupt. Due to the bankruptcy of a large number of companies, many people have become unemployed, and there has been a considerable amount of social unrest.

In order to prevent the expansion of the anti-Japanese goods movement in the United States, Japan was forced last year to stipulate that the total limit for textile exports to the United States was 235 million square yards. They hope to stipulate the same high limit this year. However, this request has been opposed by the United States, so the negotiations between the two sides have been interrupted at the beginning of this year and have not yet resumed.

    日本纺织公司卷起倒风
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国官员们10日说，日本去年约有七百家纺织公司破产，今年日本纺织公司的破产率继续保持很高的水平。
    他们说，日本破产的公司不仅限于纺织公司，有相当多的其他主要为出口贸易制造货物的日本企业也破产了。由于大批公司的破产，许多人失业，社会上也出现了相当严重的不安现象。
    日本为了防止美国排斥日货运动的扩大，曾经被迫在去年规定了向美国输出纺织品的总限额为二亿三千五百万平方码。他们希望今年也规定同样高的限额。但是这种要求已经遭到美国的反对，因此双方的谈判已经在今年年初中断，至今还没有恢复。
