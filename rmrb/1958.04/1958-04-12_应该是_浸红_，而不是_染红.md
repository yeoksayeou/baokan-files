    How exactly should one undergo labor training?
    It Should Be "Soaked Red," Not "Dyed Red"
    For an intellectual from an exploiting class family to be able to train for only three months and "not feel tired after a day of labor, and fall asleep as soon as they lie down," it truly requires no small amount of determination and willpower. I would like to shake Comrade Yu Zhiming's hand and congratulate him on completing the first lesson in labor training well.
    However, the first lesson is, after all, only the first lesson. What concerns me is that Comrade Yu Zhiming has not yet resolved a fundamental issue in labor training: What exactly does going to the mountains and countryside train?
    Is it to train "diligent limbs and distinguish the five grains"? That is something every determined comrade will obtain during the training process. It is not our ultimate goal, and we should move forward. So what is the ultimate goal? The thoughts and feelings of the working people? The labor perspective and mass perspective? I say yes, but we should further clarify where these abstract things come from. For example, if one is unwilling to do social work, can it be said that it does not conflict with the labor perspective and mass perspective? Can it be said that it is consistent with the thoughts and feelings of the working people? We must not think that not haggling over prices in labor already means having a labor perspective, nor should we think that chatting well with an old farmer already means having the thoughts and feelings of the working people and a mass perspective. In the final analysis, we must transform ourselves into genuine working people. When we reach this state, our thoughts and feelings will also be the thoughts and feelings of the working people. Therefore, I believe that to be red, one should be "soaked red," to "soak" among the working people, to "soak" earnestly, until our hearts and our marrow are soaked red. This is fundamentally different from "obtaining the qualifications of a working farmer after a year and a half." What is "qualification"? Is it a golden signboard? Does "qualification" contain the thoughts and feelings of the working people? This question is easy to answer. A signboard is just a signboard. Gold paint will fall off, and wood will rot. Moreover, no one has promised to issue a signboard after a year and a half. I'm afraid that at that time, one can only paste a "paper signboard" for oneself. That kind of red should be called "dyed red."
    The saying "to labor well is to train well" is not wrong. The problem lies in how to understand these two words "well." I have already discussed my opinion on training well above, so I won't say more. As for laboring well, I think it should at least be strictly distinguished from "laboring a lot." According to the information in Comrade Yu Zhiming's letter, it is actually "laboring a lot" (which is also necessary), or more accurately, "laboring a lot physically" rather than laboring well.
    How can it be considered "well"? Specific labor is diverse, so I can only say it relatively generally. I think that if we can proactively do things that the masses want us to do, and after we finish, the masses are satisfied and give their approval of the entire process and effect of what we have done, then this can be considered "laboring well"!

### 应该是“浸红”，而不是“染红”

    究竟应该怎样劳动锻炼？
    应该是“浸红”，而不是“染红”
    一个出身于剥削阶级家庭的知识分子能够在短短的三个月中锻炼得“劳动一天不觉累，躺在床上就熟睡”，的确需要有不小的决心和毅力，我愿紧握余志明同志的双手，祝贺他上好了劳动锻炼中的第一课。
    但是，第一课毕竟只是第一课，使我关心的是余志明同志还没有解决劳动锻炼中的一个根本性问题：上山下乡究竟锻炼什么？
    是锻炼“勤四体、分五谷”吗？那是每一个有决心的同志在锻炼过程中都会得到的东西，不是我们的最终目的，还应该向前走。那末最终目的又是什么呢？是劳动人民的思想感情？是劳动观点和群众观点？我说对，可是应该更进一步明确这些抽象的东西又从那里来的。譬如说，不愿做社会工作，能说和劳动观点、群众观点没有抵触吗？能说和劳动人民的思想感情一致吗？我们千万不要以为在劳动中不讲价钱，就已经有了劳动观点，也不要以为和一位老农民聊得不错，就已经有了劳动人民的思想感情和群众观点。归根结蒂就是必需把我们改造成为一个真正的劳动人民，达到这个境地时，我们的思想感情也就是劳动人民的思想感情了。所以我认为，要红，就应该是“浸红”，在劳动人民中去“浸”，踏踏实实地“浸”，直到浸红我们的心，我们的骨髓。这和下去“一年半载取得了劳动农民的资格”是根本不同的，“资格”是什么，是金字招牌吗？“资格”里有没有劳动人民的思想感情呢？这个问题是容易回答的。招牌只是招牌，金漆会掉，木头也会腐朽，况且一年半载是不是就有人发给招牌，谁也没有许过这个愿，只怕到那时也只能是自己给自己糊一个“纸招牌”罢了。那种红应该叫“染红”。
    “劳动得好就是锻炼得好”这句话没有错，问题是在如何领会这两个“好”字。锻炼得好，上面我已谈了我的意见，不再说，至于劳动得好，我想起码要和“劳动得多”严格区别。据余志明同志信上的情况看，实际是“劳动得多”（也是必要的），更确切些说，是“体力劳动得多”而不是劳动得好。
    怎样才算好？具体劳动多种多样，我只能比较笼统的说一说，我想，凡是群众希望我们做的事我们都能主动去做，做完后，群众对我们整个事情的过程、效果都点了头，表示满意，这可以算是“劳动得好”了！
