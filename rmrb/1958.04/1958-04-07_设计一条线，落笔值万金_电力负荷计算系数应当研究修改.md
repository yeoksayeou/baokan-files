    “Designing a Line, A Stroke Worth Ten Thousand Gold Pieces”
    The Power Load Calculation Coefficient Should Be Studied and Revised
    After studying the People’s Daily editorial on March 29th regarding "Burning the Waste and Conservatism in Technical Design," we have been greatly enlightened and educated. The phrase "Designing a line, a stroke worth ten thousand gold pieces" in the editorial is not only an encouragement but also a warning to us designers.

    Over the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, design workers have made important contributions to the country's socialist construction. However, it cannot be denied that, since the vast majority of design workers are intellectuals from non-proletarian families, the design concept of so-called "technical conscience" is prevalent. For a long time, as the editorial pointed out, design work has always emphasized safety factors and adhered to conventions. Taking the industrial enterprise power supply specialty of our Beijing First Industrial Building Design Institute as an example, the high power load calculation coefficient over the past few years has prevented all power supply equipment and materials from fully exerting their working efficiency and strength, causing serious waste to the country and straining the supply of materials. Therefore, the rapid formulation of a power load calculation coefficient that is in line with China's actual situation is an urgent task for the power supply design departments of industrial enterprises. However, the formulation of the power load coefficient cannot be accomplished by one or two design institutes alone. We hope that the national leading organs will provide unified leadership, mobilize the technical forces of relevant domestic scientific research departments and engineering technology circles, organize them to divide the work and cooperate, provide each other with information, conduct on-site observation, and, after research and discussion, formulate a unified and practical power load calculation coefficient in the shortest possible time, so as to save funds for the country and carry out power design work in a faster, better, and more economical way.

### “设计一条线，落笔值万金”  电力负荷计算系数应当研究修改

    “设计一条线，落笔值万金”
    电力负荷计算系数应当研究修改
    我们学习了人民日报3月29日关于“火烧技术设计上的浪费和保守”的社论之后，得到很大的启示和教益。社论中的“设计一条线，落笔值万金”这句话，对我们设计工作者来说，不单是鼓励，同时也是警语。
    几年来，设计工作者在党的正确领导和苏联专家的帮助下，为国家的社会主义建设事业做出了重要的贡献。但是，也不能否认，由于绝大多数的设计工作者是非无产阶级家庭出身的知识分子，普遍存在着所谓“技术良心”的设计思想，长期以来，确是如社论中所指出的：在设计工作中一直是强调保险系数和墨守成规的从事设计工作。就以我们北京第一工业建筑设计院的工业企业电力供应专业为例，几年来由于电力负荷计算系数偏高，使所有供电设备和材料都未能充分发挥工作效能和使用强度，给国家造成了严重的浪费和物资供应的紧张。因此，迅速制定切合我国实际情况的电力负荷计算系数，是工业企业电力供应设计部门的紧要任务。但是，制定电力负荷系数不是一两个设计院所能办到的。我们希望由国家领导机关统一领导，动员国内有关科学研究部门及各工程技术界的技术力量，组织起来，分工协作，相互提供资料，进行现场观测，经过研究讨论，在最短期间内制定出统一的切实可用的电力负荷计算系数，以便为国家节约资金，多快好省地进行电力设计工作。
