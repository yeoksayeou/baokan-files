Antibiotics

Antibiotics are a general term for drugs such as penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, aureomycin, etc. They come from the biological world (especially the microbial world) and are a type of chemical substance secreted or excreted during the metabolic process, capable of inhibiting or harming, and even dissolving or destroying, the normal growth and life of other organisms (or microorganisms).

The great Russian scientist Mechnikov pointed out a long time ago that some microorganisms must possess a perfect chemical weapon capable of killing other microorganisms. He founded the basic theory of antibiosis. Later, about thirty years ago, Professor Alexander Fleming, a professor of bacteriology at the University of London, accidentally dropped a microorganism into a test glass while observing a variant of Staphylococcus. After a few days, a mold colony grew there. Around this mold, the Staphylococcus, which had been growing very well, began to disappear, forming a clear halo (no bacteria grew in the halo). He then transplanted this mold, cultivated it, and studied it further, eventually identifying it as penicillin (which can be found in our daily life, such as on long-stored paste, rotten oranges and apples, and moldy clothes and leather during the moldy season). He tested the liquid obtained by culturing this bacteria with various bacteria and found that it had a strong antibacterial ability. After purifying and refining this liquid into crystals, he obtained the world-famous "penicillin."

The first antibiotic was thus born. However, the conservative thinking in the medical community at that time was extremely strong, and they doubted its powerful bactericidal effect, causing it to pass unnoticed for more than ten years. It was not until World War II, due to the urgent need for a powerful drug to treat the wounded and sick, that this first antibiotic regained attention. In 1942, it was applied to clinical practice in a new form, treating many previously considered incurable diseases, especially blood poisoning caused by inflammation, with a life-saving effect.

This brilliant achievement promoted the rapid successive appearance of streptomycin, chloramphenicol, aureomycin, and other antibiotics. To date, more than a thousand kinds of antibiotics have emerged, but only about twenty are actually applicable.

Antibiotics exist everywhere in the biological world. Penicillin, streptomycin, and other antibiotics come from the microbial world; ichthyomycin (a new invention in the Soviet Union) comes from the body of fish; "lysozyme" comes from the tears and saliva of humans and some animals; "phytoncides" come from plants such as onions and garlic; and so on. They all have special effects in killing and inhibiting various pathogenic bacteria.

Penicillin has a significant effect on blood poisoning, pneumonia, and gonorrhea; streptomycin has a significant effect on pulmonary tuberculosis, intestinal tuberculosis, and plague; chloramphenicol has a significant effect on typhoid fever, epidemic typhus, and other diseases. However, long-term use can cause bacteria to develop drug resistance, and antibiotics will lose their original effectiveness. In addition, improper use of antibiotics can also produce adverse reactions. For example, penicillin can cause anaphylactic shock; streptomycin has a damaging effect on the eighth cranial nerve, which can cause patients to develop temporary or permanent deafness; chloramphenicol hinders the hematopoietic function of the bone marrow. From this, it can be seen that antibiotics are not panaceas and should not be over-relied upon, let alone abused.

    抗生素
    邵淦
    抗生素是青霉素（配尼西林）、链霉素、氯霉素、金霉素等等药品的总称。它来自生物界（特别是微生物界）在新陈代谢过程中所分泌或排泌出来的一种化学物质，能够抑制或伤害甚至能溶解或消灭其他生物（或微生物）的生长和生活的正常进行。
    俄国伟大科学家梅契尼科夫在很早以前就指出：有些微生物一定具有一种完善的化学武器，能够杀死一些别的微生物。他创立了抗生作用的基本学说。后来，距今约三十年前，英国伦敦大学细菌学教授弗来明在试验观察萄葡球菌变种的时候，无意中在试验的玻璃器皿中掉进了一颗微生物。过了几天，那里就长出了一个霉菌的菌落。而在这个霉菌周围，那些本来生长得很好的萄葡球菌，却开始消失，形成一个很清楚的光圈（光圈中没有任何菌类生长）。于是他就将这霉菌移种出来，再加以培养研究，最后确定为青霉素（在我们日常生活中，如放久的浆糊上，腐烂的桔子、苹果上，霉季的衣服、皮革上，都能找到它的踪迹）。他将培养这菌得到的液体，试以各种细菌，发现它有很强的制菌能力，再把这种液体加以提纯精制结晶后就得到举世闻名的“青霉素”了。
    第一个抗生素就这样出世了。但当时医药界的保守思想极厉害，怀疑它有强有力的杀菌作用，使它因此默默无闻地度过了十多年。直到第二次世界大战期间，由于急需一种有力的药物来治疗伤病员，这第一个抗生素才重新引起重视。1942年，它以新的姿态被应用于临床，治疗了许多过去一向认为没有办法的绝症，特别对于炎症引起的血中毒有着起死回生的效果。
    这个辉煌的成绩促进了链霉素、氯霉素、金霉素等等抗生素的很快相继出现。到现在已出现了千余种以上的抗生素，但实际能应用的还只有二十种左右。
    生物界中无处不存在抗生素。青霉素、链霉素等抗生素来自微生物界；鱼素（苏联新发明）来自鱼的身体；“溶菌酶”来自人和一些动物的眼泪、唾液中；“植物杀菌素”来自葱、蒜等植物中；等等。它们都有杀灭和抑制各种致病细菌的特殊功效。
    青霉素对血中毒、肺炎、淋病，链霉素对肺结核、肠结核、鼠疫，氯霉素对伤寒、斑疹伤寒等等疾病，都有显著的疗效。但长期使用会使细菌产生耐药性，抗生素就失去了原有的效用。此外，抗生素用得不当还能产生不良的反应。如青霉素会产生过敏性休克；链霉素对第八脑神经有损害作用，会使病人发生暂时或永久的耳聋；氯霉素则妨碍骨髓的造血机能。由此可见，抗生素并非仙丹神药，不能过份依赖它，更不能滥用。
