    Cultivating Honey Source Forests

    Beekeeping is an agricultural and sideline business that requires little investment but yields high and quick profits. It not only generates direct profits from beekeeping itself, but also increases the yield of fruit trees and crops.

    China has a temperate climate, which is very suitable for beekeeping, and there is an urgent need for beekeeping. However, the uneven distribution of honey source plants, sometimes abundant and sometimes scarce, plentiful here and lacking there, is detrimental to the development of beekeeping. During seasons or in regions with abundant honey sources, there are often not enough bee colonies to collect honey; in seasons or regions with a lack of honey sources, sufficient bee colonies (bred when honey sources are plentiful) often weaken and die due to the interruption of honey sources. Therefore, it is suggested that relevant departments actively promote the importance of developing the beekeeping industry during the greening campaign. Furthermore, based on the existing honey source base and land climate conditions in each region, cultivate as many multi-purpose honey source trees as possible, such as elm, willow, pagoda tree, ailanthus, silk tree, linden, Chinese tallow tree, chaste tree, tamarisk, persimmon, hawthorn, jujube, walnut, plum, lychee, loquat, citrus, grapefruit, and longan, to ensure the reliable development of the beekeeping industry.

    培育蜜源林
    养蜂是投资少、获利多而快的农副业。不仅能从养蜂本身直接获利，同时还可使果树和农作物提高产量。
    我国气候温和，很适合养蜂，也迫切需要养蜂，但因蜜源植物分布不匀，有时很多有时很少，这里丰富那里缺乏，因而对发展养蜂很不利。在蜜源很多的季节或地区，往往没有足够的蜂群去采蜜；在蜜源缺乏的季节或地区，有了足够的蜂群（在蜜源充足时繁育的）又常因蜜源中断造成蜂群衰弱和死亡。因此建议各有关部门，在绿化运动中，要积极宣传发展养蜂业的重要意义，并根据本地区的原有蜜源基础和土地气候条件，尽可能的培养榆、柳、槐、樗、合欢、椴树、乌桕、荆条、柽柳、柿子、山楂、枣子、核桃、梅子、荔枝、枇杷、柑桔、柚子、龙眼等一举数得的蜜源林木，使发展养蜂业有可靠的保证。
