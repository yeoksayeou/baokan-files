Apples, anciently called "Nai," are described in ancient books like "Essential Skills for the Common People," "Compendium of Materia Medica," and "Wang Zhen's Book of Agriculture," with details on their varieties, propagation, and processing methods. The name "apple" first appeared in "A Collection of Fragrant Plants" (1708). The apple described in "A Collection of Fragrant Plants," which "smells fragrant from several steps away, tastes sweet and loose, is like cotton when unripe, and mushy and inedible when overripe," is the Mian apple that is now distributed in Northwest and North China.

Although China is one of the origins of apples, the only variety that has remained is the Mian apple. This type of apple does not store well, so it could not be developed on a large scale. The apple varieties commonly found and widely cultivated in the Chinese market today were brought to China by imperialists as tools of aggression in the past. For example, the apples of southern Liaoning in Northeast China. After the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japanese warlords seized the rights to Dalian and the Chinese Eastern Railway. To consolidate their regime and prevent future "troubles" when further invading the Chinese interior, they moved large numbers of immigrants to southern Liaoning in our country. The immigrants, with spies and veterans from the war of aggression as their core, served as "civilian" armed forces to suppress the Chinese people. To solve the livelihood problems of these immigrants, Japanese warlords chose apple cultivation as their occupation. The reasons for choosing apples were: first, apple cultivation was a new and profitable industry in Japan at the time; second, the immigrants were not accustomed to the original dryland farming in Northeast China; third, apples are perennial crops that take seven or eight years to bear fruit and more than ten years to become productive, which was ideal for consolidating the immigrants' long-term residency. At that time, Japanese aggressors instilled aggressive education in Japanese schools, one of the methods was to use apples to tempt students, saying: "Do you want to eat apples? Then go to China and eliminate the Chinese!"

The imperialists never imagined that their aggression would fail, and the apples they brought would settle down and establish themselves on Chinese soil. However, not all foreign apple varieties are good, nor are they necessarily suitable for growing in Chinese soil. Only through the sweat and wisdom of the Chinese people have foreign apple variants been transformed into excellent varieties native to China, with steadily increasing yields and quality. Of course, most of these achievements have been made since liberation.

Now, the apple-producing area in southern Liaoning, Northeast China, accounts for 80% of the country's total output. The number of apple trees planted nationwide has reached more than 30 million, far exceeding the total of 7 million trees nationwide from 1870 to 1949. As for yields, some areas have recently seen unprecedented yields of 10,000 jin per mu. At present, China's apple production is only half of Japan's, but it is estimated that by 1967, it will exceed Japan's by about four times. As for quality, when Polish pomologist Professor Piontek came to China last year to inspect fruit trees, he tasted Chinese apples and praised them as the best in the world. Of course, there are nearly 3,000 apple varieties in the world, each with its own flavor, and everyone's tastes are different. It would be an exaggeration to say that Chinese apples are the best in the world. However, some varieties of apples in China can indeed stand in the ranks of the world's excellent apples. This result was beyond the expectations of the imperialist aggressors.

    苹果和帝国主义
    翁心桐
    苹果，古称“柰”，古书“齐民要术”、“本草纲目”、“王桢农书”里都有关于它的品种、繁殖、加工方法等的介绍。“苹果”这个名称的出现，最初见于“群芳谱”（1708年）。“群芳谱”里描写的苹果，“香闻数步，味甘松，未熟者食如棉絮，过熟又沙烂不堪食”，就是现在分布在西北和华北的绵苹果。
    虽然我国是苹果发源地之一，但是留下来的品种，却只有绵苹果一种。这种苹果不耐贮藏，因此不能大量发展。目前我国市场上常见的和大量发展的苹果品种，都是过去被帝国主义者作为侵略工具带到中国来的。譬如东北辽南的苹果就是。1905年日俄战争结束，日本军阀夺得旅大和中东路特权后，为了巩固他们的政权，为了防止进一步侵入中国内地时的“后顾之忧”，向我国辽南大量移民。移民以侵略战争中的特务和退伍军人为核心，作为“民间”武装来镇压中国人民。为了解决这批移民的生活问题，日本军阀选择苹果栽培作为他们的职业。所以看中苹果，是：一、当时日本国内的苹果栽培正在新兴，经营者获利丰厚；二、移民不惯于我国东北原有大田旱作的栽培；三、苹果是多年生作物，七、八年后才能结果，十几年后才能丰产，这从巩固移民久居上来看，实在是最理想不过了。当时日本侵略者在日本学校里灌输侵略教育，办法之一就是用苹果诱惑学生说：“你们想吃苹果吗？那就到中国去吧，把中国人消灭！”
    帝国主义者怎么也想不到：他们的侵略竟然失败了，他们带来的苹果却在中国土地上成家立业了。但是外来苹果的品种并不都是优良的，也并不一定适宜在中国土壤上生长。只是经过中国人民的血汗灌溉，智慧创造，才使外来苹果变种成为中国土生土长的优良品种，而且产量质量日渐提高。当然，这成就大都是解放以后才得到的。
    现在，东北辽南苹果区的产量已占全国总产量的80％。全国栽种的苹果树则已经达到三千多万株，大大超过了1870年—1949年全国七百万株的总数。至于产量，近来有些地区已出现了历史从未有过的万斤亩。目前我国苹果产量还只及日本的一半，但估计到1967年，就可以超过日本四倍左右。至于质量，去年波兰果树研究所所长批翁塞克院士到我国来考察果树时尝到我国苹果，誉为世界第一。当然，世界苹果品种近三千，各种苹果都各有风味，各人的口味也不尽相同，说我国苹果是世界上最好的苹果，怕是过誉了。但是我国某些品种的苹果，确实能够立于世界苹果优秀的行列中。这结果，是帝国主义侵略者始料所不及的。
