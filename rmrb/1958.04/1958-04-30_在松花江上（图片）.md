    On the Songhua River

    The Songhua River, frozen for more than five months, opened to navigation on April 16th. This year, in accordance with the new requirements of the great leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and forestry production in the province, the Heilongjiang Shipping Administration has determined to shorten the travel time of towed barges and passenger-cargo ships by an average of half a day compared to the past. In this way, timber from mountainous areas, grain from remote areas, small-kiln coal from the Heilongjiang River basin, and valuable local specialties will be transported to various places more quickly than in the past to support socialist construction. This is a corner of Harbin Wharf after the opening of navigation. Photo by Yu Min (Manuscript from Heilongjiang Daily)

    在松花江上
    冰封五个多月的松花江已在4月16日开航了。今年，黑龙江航运管理局根据全省工、农、林业生产大跃进的新要求，确定拖驳船、客货轮的旅行时间比过去平均缩短半天。这样，山区的木材、边远地区的粮食和黑龙江流域的小窑煤以及珍贵的土特产品将比过去更快地运到各地支援社会主义建设。这是开航后的哈尔滨码头一角。　于敏摄（黑龙江日报稿）
