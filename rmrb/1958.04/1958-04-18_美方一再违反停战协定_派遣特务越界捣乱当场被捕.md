Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 17th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong, the U.S. side and the Korean-Chinese side members of the Military Armistice Commission's Fourth Joint Observation Team investigated the incident of a U.S. special agent violating the armistice agreement by crossing the military demarcation line and infiltrating the demilitarized zone of the Korean-Chinese side on the 15th and 16th. The results of the investigation fully confirmed the U.S. side's violation of the armistice agreement.

　　This investigation was conducted near the No. 835 military demarcation line marker in front of Kimhwa. Kim Won-soo, the U.S. special agent arrested by the Korean-Chinese side, recounted on the scene his experience of being dispatched by the U.S. side to sneak across the military demarcation line and being arrested. Kim Won-soo was originally a captured member of the Korean People's Army in the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, and was forcibly detained in South Korea by the Syngman Rhee group under the guise of "release" on June 18, 1953. In November last year, he was forcibly incorporated into the special agent organ of the Rhee puppet army. On April 8 this year, he was disguised as a sergeant of the Korean People's Army and led into the U.S. side's demilitarized zone by U.S. military personnel, and forced to cross the military demarcation line to the Korean-Chinese area to carry out espionage and other hostile activities. After crossing the military demarcation line, he lay dormant in the demilitarized zone of the Korean-Chinese side for three days, and was discovered and arrested by the Korean-Chinese side's civil administration police at 12:30 on April 11.

    美方一再违反停战协定
    派遣特务越界捣乱当场被捕
    据新华社平壤17日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯，军事停战委员会第四联合观察小组的美方和朝中方面双方成员在15、16两日就美方特务违反停战协定越过军事分界线潜入朝中方面非军事区内的事件进行了调查。调查结果完全证实美方违反停战协定的行为。
    这次调查是在金城前面的第八三五号军事分界线标志附近进行的。被朝中方面逮捕的美方特务金源洙在现场讲述了他被美方派遣偷越军事分界线被逮捕的经过。金源洙原来是在巨济岛战俘营中的朝鲜人民军被俘人员，在1953年6月18日被李承晚集团借“释放”为名强迫扣留在南朝鲜。他在去年11月间又被强行编入李伪军的特务机关。今年4月8日他被装扮成朝鲜人民军的上士，由美方军事人员引入美方非军事区，并且强迫他越过军事分界线到朝中地区进行刺探军事情报等敌对行为。他在越过军事分界线后，在朝中方面非军事区内潜伏了三天，在4月11日十二时三十分被朝中方面民政警察发现并且逮捕。
