Liberate Oneself from the "Yoke of Fame and the Chains of Profit"!

A rein and a rope are used for controlling a horse. When a horse is tightly bound by reins and ropes to a heavy cart, it can only walk slowly with a measured gait and cannot gallop even if it wants to. When newspapers now use the phrase "ten thousand horses galloping" to describe the Great Leap Forward, they are probably not referring to horses tightly tied to carts with reins and ropes.

All aspects of work now require a Great Leap Forward, and theoretical work is no exception. However, many people engaged in theoretical work are still firmly bound by the "yoke of fame and the chains of profit," so how can they leap forward?

The last paragraph of the "Communist Manifesto" states: Communists openly declare that "their aims can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win."

With the victory of the Chinese revolution throughout the country, we have overthrown the rule of the landlords and the bourgeoisie. The chain around the necks of the Chinese people has been broken and thrown into the Eastern Ocean. However, some people are still interested in maintaining a chain of individualism in their minds. This chain of individualism is specifically embodied in the desire for fame and profit in some theoretical workers.

Marx said in his article "On the Jewish Question":

"What is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest.

"What is the worldly cult of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly god? Money.

"Very well then! Emancipation from huckstering and money,… that is, a self-emancipation of our age." (Note 1)

Marx concluded:

"The emancipation of the Jew is, in the final analysis, the emancipation of mankind from Judaism." (Note 2)

I think there are still many such "Jews" among those engaged in theoretical work today. They have not yet liberated themselves from huckstering and money. Some of them have simply become obsessed with wealth. The more money they have, the more stingy they become. They are loaded with money, but they only buy two pieces of cake to entertain international friends. Some rack their brains to take advantage in dividing royalties and get a little more. Could there be anything uglier than this?

Fame and profit are inextricably linked. Those who love profit cannot but love fame. Especially those who do theoretical work now, their way of making money is by writing pamphlets. And the effect of writing pamphlets is not only to earn royalties, but also to hunt for fame, to become a national "celebrity." Some people are not satisfied with gaining fame in China and even try to gain fame abroad, to become world-renowned figures, international theoretical authorities. Of course, once a pamphlet is sold abroad, it can earn a large royalty. Truly, both fame and profit are achieved.

Unfortunately, these people do not understand the dialectics of real life at all. They do not understand that when they bury themselves in writing worthless pamphlets in pursuit of fame and profit, their Party spirit will also be extinguished.

The "yoke of fame and the chains of profit" is a stumbling block and a pitfall on the road of progress for Marxist-Leninist theoretical workers. Many people have already fallen into it and cannot extricate themselves.

If those engaged in theoretical work want to make a leap forward in theoretical work, they must first stop being "Jews" and liberate themselves from the "yoke of fame and the chains of profit," and honestly strive to earnestly study Marxism-Leninism.

### 从“名缰利索”中解放出来！

专栏：

    从“名缰利索”中解放出来！
    缰与索是御马用的东西。马被缰与索紧紧地捆绑在笨重的大车上，它就只能迈着翰林步慢吞吞地在路上走着，想奔腾也奔腾不起来。现在报纸上用“万马奔腾”的字样来形容大跃进，恐怕不是指的那种被缰与索紧紧系在大车上的马。
    现在各方面的工作都是要求大跃进，理论工作也不能例外。但是，许多从事理论工作的人还在被“名缰利索”死死地束缚着，要他们跃进，怎么跃进得起来呢？
    “共产党宣言”的最后一段话是这样说的：共产党人公开声言，“他们的目的只有用强力推翻全部现存社会制度才可以达到。让那些统治阶级在共产主义革命面前发抖吧。无产者在这革命中只会失去自己颈上的一条锁链。他们所能获得的却是整个世界。”
    随着中国革命在全国的胜利，我们已经推翻了地主资产阶级的统治，中国人民颈上的一条锁链被打碎了，被扔到东洋大海里去了，可是还有一些人还有兴趣于在自己的精神中保持着一条个人主义的锁链。这条个人主义的锁链具体地体现在某些理论工作者的身上，就是名利思想。
    马克思在“论犹太人问题”的文章中说：
    “犹太的世俗基础是什么呢？实际需要，自私自利。
    “犹太人的世俗偶像是什么呢？做生意。他们的世俗上帝是什么呢？金钱。
    “既然这样，那末从做生意和金钱中获得解放，……也就是现代的自我解放。”（注一）
    马克思得出结论说：
    “犹太人的解放，就其终极意义来说，就是人类从犹太（注二）中获得解放。”
    我看现在从事理论工作者当中还有不少这样的“犹太人”，他们还没有从做生意和金钱中解放出来。他们当中有的人简直成了财迷。越有钱，越吝啬。腰缠万贯而只买两块蛋糕招待国际友人。有的为分稿费而费尽心机打主意多沾点便宜。丑还有丑于此者乎？
    名与利是血肉相连的。好利者未有不好名者。尤其是现在作理论工作的人，生财之道就是靠写小册子，而写小册子的作用，不仅可以赚稿费，而且可以猎名，可以成为全国“名流”，有的人在中国得了名还不过瘾，还要企图在国外得名，成为世界名人，国际理论权威。当然，小册子一旦在国外得售，又可以赚很大一笔稿费。真是名利双全。
    可惜这些人根本不懂实际生活中的辩证法。他们不懂得，当他们为了追逐名利而埋头于写不值钱的小册子的时候，他们的党性也就随之而澌灭殆尽。
    “名缰利索”是马克思列宁主义的理论工作者前进道路上的绊马索，是陷坑。不少的人已经陷进去了，不能自拔。
    从事理论工作者要想在理论工作方面跃进，首先不要再作“犹太人”，要从“名缰利索”中解放出来，老老实实地为认真研究马克思列宁主义而奋斗。

    （注二）这里所说的“犹太”，意即做生意，金钱，高利贷者，商人。见上书同页注。
