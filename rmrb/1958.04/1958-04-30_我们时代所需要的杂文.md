The Kind of Essays Our Era Needs
    Lin Danqiu

In the struggle against the rightists, many comrades made a stern criticism of the essays of the rightist Xu Maoyong. The significance of criticizing these poisonous weeds lies not only in exposing Xu Maoyong's anti-Party face and anti-Party methods, but also in eliminating their negative influence on the essay garden and correcting the unhealthy trends in essays. What kind of essays our era needs and what kind of essays it does not need is a question that has not been correctly resolved in the minds of many people. As for me, precisely because of my erroneous understanding of this issue, I was once confused by Xu Maoyong's essays, regarding many of his poisonous weeds as fragrant flowers.

Most of the essays published by Xu Maoyong in the People's Daily supplement under various pen names in the first half of last year were handled by me. At that time, not only did I not see the anti-Party essence of many of them, but I also thought they were well-written and praised them. After the anti-rightist struggle, after everyone's criticism of these poisonous weeds, and after self-ideological examination, I realized my mistakes. The main reason why I regarded poisonous weeds as fragrant flowers at the time was that my erroneous views on essays had certain things in common with Xu Maoyong. First, I uncritically regarded many people's criticisms and accusations of essays as obstacles to the development of essays, as specific manifestations of their dislike of criticism and self-criticism; and I tried to be tolerant of the shortcomings and errors of the essays themselves, and even failed to see certain errors of a fundamental nature. The reason why I published Xu Maoyong's article "The New Crisis of Essays" and added an "Editor's Note" hoping that everyone would discuss it was mainly because I wanted to affirm the positive significance and positive role of essays today and reduce some "obstacles" and dispel some "concerns" of essay writers through discussion, rather than to criticize Xu Maoyong's "crisis" theory, nor to solve the problem of the development direction of essays themselves. The reason why this discussion did not achieve positive results, but instead strengthened the negative influence of the "crisis" theory, was related to my erroneous ideological emotions as the editor. Second, when judging essay works, I one-sidedly emphasized the characteristics and "flavor" of essays, emphasized unique styles, and did not first consider the political stance and political effect of the works. I only knew that the three bad isms must be opposed, and that the undemocratic ideology and style of some cadres should be criticized, but I did not pay attention to what position the author was standing on and what attitude he was using to oppose and criticize. Serious right-leaning ideological emotions made me unable to distinguish between the rightists' attacks and the people's internal self-criticism, unable to smell the different scents of Marxism and revisionism, and even smelled the fragrance from Xu Maoyong's poisonous weeds, and did not pay attention to some readers' objections.

The serious lesson lies in neglecting politics.

In fact, no matter how many banners Xu Maoyong hung in his essays against dogmatism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, no matter how many phrases he quoted from classic works, and no matter how many of his own "experiences" he offered, his reactionary stance, viewpoints, and attitudes were still very clear. On the surface, he pretended to stand on the position of supporting the Party and supporting socialism to oppose the "undemocratic" behavior of some "senior cadres," but in reality, his attack was precisely directed at the leadership and policies of the Party and at socialist society through the full slander and vicious attacks on senior cadres. The position is not an abstract thing, it is always expressed through the author's specific attitude towards things, through the author's specific ideological emotions. Judging from his many essays, he always stood outside the Party, outside the "senior cadres," outside the people's collective, and with the hateful emotions of "moths flying into the fire, unaware of death," he shot cold arrows and threw cold punches at our Party and new society. His beautification of the bourgeoisie's revisionist views, his "fear of democracy" and "fear of undemocracy" "experiences," and his roundabout, humorous, and scolding "art" all served his cold arrows and cold punches. This is Xu Maoyong's "spirit of individuality in form," and this is the style of Xu Maoyong's essays. "Style is the man!"

Xu Maoyong said in "Correspondence on Essays" that writing essays must "take care of the reader's heart," "some places should be tactful and roundabout, leading the reader to think repeatedly; some places should be decisive, giving the reader a clear concept." He used this method to shoot cold arrows and throw cold punches in many essays. For example, the article "Also on Tragedy" said that there were such tragedies in history, there were such tragedies, quoting scriptures and citing classics, looking like an academic essay. But when it came to the end, he suddenly released a cold arrow, saying that in today's society, there is also "another kind of tragedy" that happened in history, "that is, the tragedy of people who are destroyed without any fault of their own." And even more abominable is that he said: Today, "some people, for the sake of being 'comprehensive,' always have to blame those who are destroyed, saying something like 'He should also be responsible subjectively!'" Then he brought out Chernyshevsky's words in the old era, saying that this is equivalent to blaming the little lamb that was eaten by the wolf for going to the river where it might encounter wolves, which is "cruel to the point of making people resentful." Seeing this, you realize that he was pulling the bow and aiming from the beginning, and all the "philosophical speculation" and "scientific arguments" were all for shooting this arrow! Looking at the whole article, how "tactful and roundabout" this short article is, "leading the reader to think repeatedly": what kind of society is today's society after all? And how "decisive" the cold arrow is, "giving the reader a clear concept": today's society turns out to be such a society! Is today's society really such a society? Only the anti-Party, anti-socialist "dark" ears and eyes can see "the tragedy of people who are destroyed without any fault of their own" here and there, and hear the "blame" on these "people." In Xu Maoyong's mind, all his anti-Party words and deeds are not "faults," and the Party's repeated serious punishments to him are also "blame" that is "cruel to the point of making people resentful," and he himself is the protagonist of "another kind of tragedy." How can a "Party member" with such ideological emotions not shoot cold arrows at the Party?

The reason why this cold arrow shooter chose essays as an anti-Party tool was not accidental. He said very clearly in "Correspondence on Essays" that whether in the old society or in "today's China," essays are "street talk" that is opposed to "official language," and the "humorous scolding" of those in the opposition, as if the "officials" could not help it. So using such a tool to oppose the Party can gain a little "advantage." This is naturally just Xu Maoyong's "experience," which has nothing to do with "today's China," nothing to do with "street talk" in today's China, and nothing to do with general essay writers. But it is worth noting that: in terms of speaking from the position and attitude of "those in the opposition," Xu Maoyong has become a representative of many essay writers.

In the past year or two, essays have become active. This is not a bad thing. What is bad is the unhealthy trend that has appeared in many essays. The tone of many essays is not a straightforward, enthusiastic criticism, but a depressed, hesitant, and cold sarcasm. These authors seem to still live in the old era, the old China, and when they write essays, they always adopt the attitude of "unofficial commoners" criticizing "state affairs." They take a cold and detached attitude towards the Party and the people's struggles and victories, and towards the ever-changing, magnificent socialist revolution and construction cause, so their criticisms of shortcomings and errors in life and work are also oblique and sarcastic, as if everything has nothing to do with themselves. Such essays cannot reflect the pulse of the people's collective and the atmosphere of our era, nor can they inspire readers to overcome shortcomings and eliminate errors from the standpoint of cherishing the socialist cause, but will instead cause readers to have the illusion of "darkness" in the real society. This is obviously not the kind of essays that our era requires.

Some authors often take Mr. Lu Xun's essays as an example to defend their cold sarcastic essays, believing that this is the characteristic of essays. In fact, one of the basic characteristics of Lu Xun's essays is heat, is the "hot wind" that breaks through the "cold" air of the old society. When you read his essays, while feeling that the enemy's face is hateful, you also feel the revolutionary heat, feel the power to encourage progress, thereby arousing contempt for the enemy and faith in the victory of the revolution. This is precisely the greatness of Lu Xun's "spirit of individuality." If essay writers living in the hot new society really want to learn from Lu Xun, they must first eliminate the distance between themselves and the Party and the people, stand closely with the Party and the people, and transform the cold wind in their works into a hot wind, reflecting the revolutionary will and construction enthusiasm of the people through praise, criticism, and even satire, and also reflecting the shortcomings and errors that hinder our progress, so that they become sharp weapons for ideological struggle and ideological education. This is the kind of essays that our era requires.

Our era is an era in which the Party and the People's Government lead the people and mobilize all forces to build a new socialist life, an era in which the people are truly the masters of their own affairs, and an era in which everyone is "responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Everyone should stand in the midst of "us" and should not stand outside of "us." The great achievements of revolution and construction are "ours," and the shortcomings and errors in life and work are also "ours." Praise what should be praised, commend what should be commended, criticize what should be criticized, satirize what should be satirized, all for the sake of socialism, for the sake of the great unity and great leap forward of the whole people. Our essays do not need cold words, they should be full of enthusiasm; they do not need to be hesitant, they should be pleasant to hear. Correct stance, healthy tone, and clear style should be the basic characteristics of our essays. This will never hinder the diversification of the content, form, and style of essays, nor will it hinder the full play of the wisdom and talent of all authors who cherish socialism. Different authors should reflect the pulse of the times and explore the truth of life through their different real feelings, using different knowledge and skills. Such essays will inevitably be loved by the broad masses of readers and supported by the Party and the people, and will never encounter a "crisis of extinction" like Xu Maoyong's anti-Party essays.

Promoting the development of essays is an important task of newspaper editors. The People's Daily supplement has contributed to promoting essays, but it has also made major mistakes. We have not actively promoted the kind of essays needed by our era in theory and in the practice of editorial work, but have instead published many essays that are not needed by our era, which has had a bad influence on newspapers and periodicals in various places; in particular, the publication of Xu Maoyong's many poisonous weeds without criticism for a long time, in addition to political influence, has also greatly fueled the unhealthy trend of essays.

Checking errors is to correct errors, in order to better promote the prosperity of essays. Past experiences and lessons tell us that the key to developing essays lies in expanding the ranks of authors. The narrow scope of authors will not only limit the contact surface of the content of essays and the diversification of the form and style of essays, but will also limit the improvement of the quality of essays. Essays were originally a general term for various short essays and sketches, and are the light weapons that are most convenient for the vast number of writers and all working comrades who are interested in writing. What you see, hear, do, experience, know, and feel, one person, one thing, one scene, as long as it is of educational significance, can become the object of reflection in essays, whether it is praise, criticism, or suggestion. As long as it is meaningful, coherent, and beneficial to the reader, there can be opportunities for publication. In today's all-people great leap forward that is advancing rapidly, it is of greater significance for everyone to use these short articles to quickly reflect the appearance of reality and raise noteworthy issues. As long as more people write, the content, form, and style of essays will be richer and more diverse, so that they can learn from each other and promote each other, so that essays that serve socialist revolution and construction can also develop at a leap forward speed. The authors of essays should be very broad, not only writers can write, but all leading cadres and working comrades who are interested in writing can write. In this way, we can train a large army of essayists scattered in various work positions. Everyone's criticism of past essays should become a force to promote the progress of essays and a prelude to correcting the writing style of essays. Let the new upsurge of socialist construction bring a new atmosphere to the essay garden.

    我们时代所需要的杂文
    林淡秋
    在反右派斗争中，许多同志对右派分子徐懋庸的杂文做了严正的批判。批判这些毒草的意义不仅在于揭露徐懋庸的反党面目和反党手法，而且在于清除它们对杂文园地的恶劣影响，纠正杂文的歪风。我们的时代到底需要怎样的杂文，不需要怎样的杂文，这个问题在许多人的脑子里还没有得到正确的解决。拿我来说，正由于对这个问题的认识错误，就曾经被徐懋庸的杂文所迷惑，把他的许多毒草看作香花。
    徐懋庸在去年上半年以各种笔名在人民日报副刊上发表的杂文，大都是我处理的。我当时非但没有看出其中许多篇的反党实质，而且认为它们写得不坏，加以赞赏。经过反右派斗争，经过大家对这些毒草的批判，经过自我思想检查，我才认识自己的错误。我当时所以把毒草当作香花，主要因为我对杂文问题的错误看法跟徐懋庸有某些共同的地方。第一，我把许多人对杂文的批评指责不加分析地看作发展杂文的阻力，看作他们不喜欢批评和自我批评的具体表现；而对杂文本身的缺点和错误，则尽量加以宽容，甚至看不出某些带根本性质的错误。我所以发表徐懋庸的“小品文的新危机”一文，而且加上“编者按”，希望大家加以讨论，主要因为想通过讨论来肯定杂文在今天的积极意义和积极作用，减少一些“阻力”，解除杂文作者的一些“顾虑”，而不是为要批判徐懋庸的“危机”论，也不是为要解决杂文本身的发展方向问题。这次讨论所以没有取得积极的效果，反而加强了“危机”论的恶劣影响，那是跟作为编者的我的错误的思想情绪相关联的。第二，在评判杂文作品的时候，我片面地强调杂文的特点和“味道”，强调独特的风格，而不首先考虑作品的政治立场和政治效果问题。只知三个坏主义必须反对，有些干部的不民主思想作风应该批评，而不注意作者站在什么立场上，用什么态度来反对，来批评。严重的右倾思想情绪，使我辨不清右派分子的进攻和人民内部的自我批评的区别，嗅不出马克思主义和修正主义的不同气味，甚至从徐懋庸的毒草闻到了香味，不重视有些读者的反对意见。
    严重的教训在于忽视政治。
    其实，不管徐懋庸在他的杂文中挂起多少反对教条主义、反对官僚主义、反对宗派主义的幌子，引用多少经典著作里的词句，端出多少他自己的“体会”，他的反动的立场、观点和态度，还是很鲜明的。他在表面上假装站在拥护党、拥护社会主义的立场上反对有些“高级干部”的“不民主”，而实际上，他的攻击矛头正是通过对高级干部的尽情诬蔑和恶毒攻击，指向党的领导和党的政策，指向社会主义社会。立场不是抽象的东西，总是通过作者对事物的具体态度，通过作者的具体思想情绪表现出来的。从他的许多杂文来看，他总是站在党之外，站在“高级干部”之外，站在人民集体之外，带着“飞蛾扑火，不知死活”的仇恨情绪，向我们的党和新社会放冷箭，打冷拳。他的美化资产阶级的修正主义观点，他的“怕民主”和“怕不民主”的“体会”，他的迂回曲折、嬉笑怒骂的“艺术”，都是为他的冷箭冷拳服务的。这就是徐懋庸的“精神个体性的形式”，就是徐懋庸的杂文的风格。“风格就是人！”
    徐懋庸在“关于杂文的通信”里说写杂文必须“照顾读者的心”，“有的地方要委婉曲折，引得读者反复去想；有的地方要斩钉截铁，使读者得到明确的概念。”他在许多杂文里就是用这样手法放冷箭、打冷拳的。例如“也论悲剧”一文，说历史上有这样的悲剧，有那样的悲剧，引经据典，俨然一篇学术小品。可是说到最后，突然放出一枝冷箭，说今天的社会里，也有在历史上发生过的“另外一种悲剧”，“就是自己毫无过失但遭到灭亡的人们的悲剧”。而更可恶的是他说：今天“有些人为了‘全面’，总也要对那遭到毁灭的人物责备几句，说什么‘他主观上也应负责任呵！’”。于是端出车尔尼雪夫斯基在旧时代说的话，说这等于责备被狼狗吃了的小羔羊不该到可能遇到狼的小河边去一样，是“残忍到使人愤恨的”。看到这里，你才知道他一开始便在拉弓瞄准，一切“哲学的思辩”和“科学的论证”，都是为了射这一箭！从全文看，这篇短文写得多么“委婉曲折”，“引得读者反复去想”：今天的社会到底是怎样的社会？而冷箭一出，又是多么“斩钉截铁”，“使读者得到明确的概念”：今天的社会原来是这样的社会！今天的社会真是这样的社会吗？只有反党、反社会主义的“阴暗”的耳目，才在这里那里看见“自己毫无过失但遭到灭亡的人们的悲剧”，听到对这些“人们”的“责备”。在徐懋庸的心目中，他的一切反党言行也不是什么“过失”，党一再给他的严正处分也是“残忍到使人愤恨”的“责备”，他自己也是“另外一种悲剧”的主角。有这样思想情绪的“党员”，怎能不向党放冷箭呢？
    这个冷箭手所以选择杂文作为反党工具，那也不是偶然的。他在“关于杂文的通信”里说得很清楚，不管在旧社会或在“现在的中国”，杂文都是跟“官话”对立的“街谈巷议”，是在野者的“嬉笑怒骂”，仿佛“官”们也奈何不得。所以用这样的工具反党，可以占一点“便宜”。这自然不过是徐懋庸的“体会”，跟“现在的中国”无关，跟现在中国的“街谈巷议”无关，跟一般杂文作者无关。不过值得注意的是：拿以“在野者”的立场和态度说话一点来说，徐懋庸却成为不少杂文作者的代表了。
    一两年来，杂文活跃起来了。这不是坏事情。坏的是出现在许多杂文里的一股歪风。许多杂文的腔调，大都不是理直气壮、热情洋溢的批评，而是郁郁寡欢、吞吞吐吐的冷嘲。这些作者仿佛仍然生活在旧时代，旧中国，写起杂文来，总是采取“在野布衣”非议“朝政”的态度。他们对于党和人民的战斗和胜利，对于日新月异、气象万千的社会主义革命和建设事业，采取冷眼旁观的态度，所以对于生活和工作中的缺点和错误的批评，也是旁敲侧击的冷嘲，好像一切跟自己无关。这样的杂文不能反映人民集体的脉搏和我们时代的气息，也不能激发读者站在爱护社会主义事业的立场上克服缺点、消灭错误的热情，反而会引起读者对现实社会的“阴暗”的错觉。这显然不是我们的时代所要求的杂文。
    有些作者往往以鲁迅先生的杂文为例，为自己的冷嘲式杂文辩解，认为杂文的特点就是如此。其实，鲁迅杂文的基本特点之一是热，是突破旧社会的“寒冽”空气的“热风”。你读了他的杂文，在感到敌人面目可憎的同时，也感到革命的热力，感到鼓舞前进的力量，从而引起对敌人的蔑视和对革命胜利的信念。这正是鲁迅的“精神个体性”的伟大处。生活在热火朝天的新社会里的杂文作者，如果真要学习鲁迅的话，首先必须消灭自己同党和人民的距离，紧紧跟党和人民站在一起，变自己作品中的冷风为热风，通过歌颂、批评乃至讽刺，反映出人民大众的革命意志和建设热情，也反映出阻碍我们前进的缺点和错误，使成为思想斗争和思想教育的锋利武器。这才是我们时代所要求的杂文。
    我们的时代是党和人民政府领导人民、调动一切力量建设社会主义新生活的时代，真正是人民当家作主的时代，真正是“天下兴亡，匹夫有责”的时代。人人应该站在“我们”之中，不应该站在“我们”之外。革命和建设的伟大成绩是“我们”的，生活和工作中的缺点和错误也是“我们”的。该歌颂的歌颂，该表扬的表扬，该批评的批评，该讽刺的讽刺，一切为了社会主义，为了全民大团结，大跃进。我们的杂文不需要冷言冷语，应该是热气腾腾；不需要吞吞吐吐，应该是娓娓动听。正确的立场，健康的基调，明朗的风格，应该是我们的杂文的基本特色。这决不会妨碍杂文的内容、形式和风格的多样化，不会妨碍一切爱护社会主义的作者的聪明才智的发挥。不同作者应该通过各自不同的实感，运用不同的知识和技巧，反映时代的脉搏，发掘生活的真理。这样的杂文必然会受到广大读者的热爱，得到党和人民的支持，永远不会像徐懋庸的反党杂文那样碰到“消亡的危机”。
    推动杂文的发展，是报刊编辑的一项重要任务。人民日报副刊在提倡杂文方面尽过一份力量，但也犯过重大错误。我们没有在理论上和编辑工作实践上积极提倡我们时代所需要的杂文，反而发表了不少我们时代不需要的杂文，使各地报刊受到坏影响；特别是发表了徐懋庸的许多毒草而在长时期内不加批判，除了政治影响之外，还大大助长了杂文的歪风。
    检查错误是为了改正错误，为了更好地促进杂文的繁荣。过去的经验教训告诉我们：发展杂文的关键在于扩大作者的队伍。作者范围的狭窄，非但要限制杂文内容的接触面和杂文形式和风格的多样化，而且要限制杂文质量的提高。杂文原是各种短小散文小品的总称，是最便于广大作家和一切有写作兴趣的工作同志使用的轻武器。所见、所闻、所作、所经、所知、所感，一人一事一景，只要有教育意义的，都可以成为杂文的反映对象，歌颂也好，批评也好，建议也好。只要言之有物，成理、成章，于读者有益，都可以有发表的机会。在一日千里的全民大跃进的今天，大家用这类短文来迅速反映现实的面貌，提出值得注意的问题，更有重大的意义。只要写的人多了，杂文的内容、形式和风格，更丰富更多样了，便可以互相学习，互相促进，使为社会主义的革命和建设服务的杂文也以跃进的速度发展起来。杂文的作者应该是很广泛的，不仅作家能写，一切有写作兴趣的领导干部和工作同志都可以写。这样便可以锻炼出一支散布在各种工作岗位上的杂文大军。大家对过去杂文的批判，应该成为推动杂文前进的力量，端正杂文文风的先声。让社会主义建设的新高潮带来杂文园地的新气象。
