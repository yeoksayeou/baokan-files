    Lycoris Radiata
    Lycoris radiata, also known as wild garlic, is a perennial herb that likes to grow in shady areas under trees at the foot of mountains, embankments, dikes, and cemeteries. It grows abundantly in the Jiangnan region of China. Lycoris radiata has a spherical bulb underground, similar to a narcissus, and is grayish-black in color. Lycoris radiata bulbs can be processed into lycoris radiata slices or lycoris radiata powder. Lycoris radiata slices contain more than 60% starch and about 0.1% lycorine. Lycoris radiata powder can be used to extract about 30% plant-based glue, about 48% starch, and about 0.1% lycorine. The plant-based glue can replace wheat flour paste for sizing yarn, and its utilization rate is approximately 133% of that of wheat flour. Lycoris radiata starch can also be used to make glucose and various foods. Lycorine is a valuable medicinal substance, currently with an import price of about 1,700 yuan per kilogram. Lycoris radiata resources are abundant, but no one has utilized them in the past. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Hunan and other places have only started purchasing them in recent years, and in the past two years, they have purchased 25,000 dan of lycoris radiata slices.

    石蒜
    石蒜，又名野蒜，是多年生草本植物，喜生于山麓、堤塘、墓地等树荫下面，我国江南地区多有生长。石蒜地下有球形鳞茎，似水仙，呈灰黑色。石蒜鳞茎可加工成石蒜片或石蒜粉。石蒜片含有60％多的淀粉和0.1％左右的石蒜碱。石蒜粉可提制30％左右的植物胶，48％左右的淀粉，0.1％左右的石蒜碱。植物胶可代替小麦粉浆纱，其利用率约相当于小麦粉的133％；石蒜淀粉还可制葡萄糖和各种食品；石蒜碱是一种价值高贵的药品，现每公斤进口价约一千七百元。石蒜资源丰富，但过去无人利用。湖南等地供销合作社近几年才开始收购，两年来就收购了石蒜片两万五千担。
