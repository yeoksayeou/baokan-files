Comrades Delegates:

    I am entrusted by the Second Committee of the All-China Democratic Youth Federation to deliver this report to the Congress.

            (I)

    Five years ago, when we convened the Second Congress, it was the first year of our country's First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy. Today, the even more magnificent Second Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy has already begun. The soaring progress of the motherland inspires us. Every one of us youth should resolutely make greater contributions to socialist construction.

    Our era is an extraordinary era. In just a few years, the Chinese people, with an overwhelming spirit, have been leaping forward with one revolution after another. After establishing the people's regime nationwide in 1949, we proceeded with land reform. As soon as land reform was completed, we began the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce. After the basic completion of the three major socialist transformations, namely, the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production, our people launched a nationwide rectification movement and a struggle against the bourgeois rightists last year. Based on the decisive victory of this socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, a high tide of socialist construction is now emerging nationwide. In the countryside, hundreds of millions of farmers, under the slogan of "Fighting Hard for Three Years to Change the Face of the Countryside," are engaged in a heroic struggle to transform nature and strive for a bumper harvest. In factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools, a vigorous revolutionary wave of anti-waste and anti-conservatism has been set off. Exerting all efforts, striving for the top, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results have become the action slogan of the broad masses of the people. A nationwide socialist great competition of comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced has taken shape. Many things that were impossible in the past can now be done; things that used to take a long time to accomplish can now be completed in a short period. All this shows that our nation has great hope, and our motherland has an infinitely bright future. Even before the birth of the new China, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Chinese people will see that once the destiny of China is in the hands of the people themselves, China will shine upon the earth with its brilliant light, like the sun rising in the east..." The facts of the past few years have increasingly vividly confirmed Chairman Mao's great prediction.

    Now, our Party has put forward a new and great goal to the people of the whole country: to catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer; to realize the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule; and to approach or reach the world's advanced level in urgently needed scientific and technological fields in a not-too-long period. In order to make our country a great socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. This is a great and arduous task. The Chinese people have full confidence in completing this historical task. Because we have the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, the incomparably superior socialist system, and the infinite wisdom and strength of hundreds of millions of organized people. In the past few years, Chinese youth, whether in the struggle of socialist revolution or in various construction posts, have always been the most enthusiastic, active, and courageous force; tens of thousands of heroes, models, and advanced individuals have emerged among the youth. Today, in the face of new and great historical tasks, Chinese youth should exert all efforts, strive for the top, and play a vanguard role in the socialist Great Leap Forward.

            (II)

    Our era is an era of the socialist Great Leap Forward. Our country's industrial and agricultural production is leaping forward, and the thinking of the broad masses of the people is also leaping forward. The Chinese youth, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, have always stood at the forefront of the times. After the rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle, the broad masses of youth have been deeply tempered ideologically, and their political consciousness has greatly improved. They have further recognized the future of the country, recognized their responsibilities, and become more fond of the Communist Party and socialism. Comparing thoughts and comparing drive have formed a widespread upsurge among the youth. Under the situation of the socialist Great Leap Forward, everyone feels that it is necessary to continue to improve their consciousness, transform themselves, consciously pass the socialist test well, make a great leap forward in their thinking, and temper themselves into new people of socialism.

    The new era requires us to have new ideas. Today, the whole world is already in a situation where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and socialism has become the mainstream of the times. Our country has also completed the socialist revolution in the ownership of the means of production and established the socialist system. Socialism is the source of happiness, which promotes the rapid development of our country's economic and cultural undertakings, and opens up an infinitely bright and beautiful future for our people and youth. Socialism is the inevitable trend of historical development and an irresistible force. Anyone who violates the trend of history is bound to suffer a shameful defeat. The rampant attack of the bourgeois rightists against socialism last summer, which was crushed by the people of the whole country, is a powerful proof. The socialist system requires people to establish socialist ideas that are compatible with it and to eliminate the bourgeois ideas left over from the old society. Bourgeois ideology is the superstructure of capitalist society, which constantly corrodes and sabotages socialist society and is incompatible with the new society. Our generation of youth, especially those from exploiting classes, have not completely shaken off the ideological influence of the old society. The ruling classes of the old society, especially the bourgeoisie, once used their political views and academic thoughts, their outlook on life and morality, to influence us. Moreover, they still use people's habitual forces and traditional prejudices to constantly influence our thinking. Bourgeois ideology is a serious harm to us. It prevents us from correctly understanding objective things, it shackles our enthusiasm and creativity, it prevents us from fully adapting to the new society, and even causes endless distress. Therefore, we must consciously strive to transform our thinking and completely liberate ourselves from the influence of bourgeois ideology.

    Ideological transformation requires us to change from the bourgeois position or a wavering intermediate state to resolutely standing on the socialist position and entrusting our hearts to the Communist Party and socialism; it also requires us to eliminate bourgeois individualism and establish the collective ideology of the working class. To do as Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed, "Serve the workers and peasants wholeheartedly, serve socialism, and place individual interests within the collective interests of the masses, rather than above the collective interests of the masses."

    Everyone needs ideological transformation. Chairman Mao said: "In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to be transformed. Exploiters need to be transformed, and laborers also need to be transformed. Who says that the working class does not need to be transformed? Of course, the transformation of exploiters and the transformation of laborers are two different types of transformation and cannot be confused." Even the working class needs to transform themselves, is there anyone who does not need to be transformed? Some young people use this or that reason as an excuse to think that they no longer need to be transformed, which is obviously wrong. We must also understand that the speed of socialist development is very fast, and people's thinking can easily lag behind objective reality. If we lag behind and are unwilling to work hard to catch up, we may become an obstacle to social progress. Therefore, our youth must constantly transform ourselves, always maintain a strong revolutionary will and a high sensitivity to new things, and always look forward in order to become promoters of the socialist cause.

    Everyone can be transformed, but transformation is not easy. If we take transformation too easily, thinking that since "existence determines consciousness," today we live in a socialist society, or our economic status has changed with the socialist transformation, our ideology will naturally be transformed well; then it will hinder our conscious efforts to transform. The change in people's ideology always lags behind the change in their socio-economic status. Therefore, transforming old ideology is more difficult and takes more time than transforming old relations of production. Moreover, the transformation of ideology is to completely transform from the bourgeois standpoint to the working-class standpoint, which is a fundamental transformation that requires long-term and even painful tempering. It is certainly not easy for young people in the industrial and commercial sectors to transform themselves completely; it is also not easy for bourgeois intellectuals to completely transform themselves. As for young workers and peasants, they must constantly wash away the dust of bourgeois ideology on their bodies so that their thinking can adapt to the rapid changes in the objective situation, which requires conscious efforts to transform.

    Correctly understanding the relationship between politics and professional work enables us to more deeply understand the necessity of transformation. Chairman Mao taught us that ideology and politics are the commander, the soul; without correct political views, it is tantamount to having no soul. Some young people say: "As long as I have the ability, it doesn't matter whether I ask about politics or not, I can still serve socialism." This kind of thinking is wrong. No one can be separated from politics, either the politics of the proletariat or the politics of the bourgeoisie. If a person does not have the political views of the proletariat and does not have socialist ideas, even if he has some ability, it is impossible for him to serve socialism well, and he may even embark on a reactionary road. During the rampant attack of the bourgeois rightists against the Party and socialism last summer, some young people, precisely because they usually did not pay much attention to politics and were corroded by bourgeois ideology, could not withstand the storm and could not stand firm, and some even degenerated into rightists. What our Party and country expect from young people is that we have both a firm political stand and proficient professional skills, and that we are both red and expert.

    The greatest purpose of ideological transformation is to make our subjective understanding consistent with the objective world, to completely liberate ourselves from bourgeois prejudice and ignorance, to be able to actively transform the objective world, and to seek true freedom of thought. The bourgeoisie also clamors for "freedom of thought," but because they are limited by the prejudices of their own class, they can never correctly understand the objective world. Only when people eliminate bourgeois ideology and establish socialist ideology can they recognize the laws of development of the objective world and the specific path of subjective efforts, can they change from blindly obeying the domination of the objective world to actively mastering their own destiny, and can they obtain true freedom in their thinking.

    The victory of ideological transformation depends on our consciousness and determination to persevere in carrying it out. The way to transform is to work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, study current affairs and policies, and study in connection with social reality and our own ideological reality, to actively participate in socialist labor and struggle. Among young intellectuals, in particular, we should strengthen physical labor training. By consciously participating in labor training and actively throwing ourselves into the great socialist cause, we can constantly transform ourselves in the process of transforming the objective world, and we can become worthy new people of socialism.

            (III)

    Our national youth should not only adhere to the socialist political direction and establish working-class ideology, but also actively participate in socialist construction and make contributions to the great cause of building socialism.

    In the current situation of the national Great Leap Forward, young people on all fronts have displayed socialist initiative and, through heroic and outstanding labor, have become an extremely active force in the Great Leap Forward. Young people on the industrial front are determined to catch up with and surpass Britain and are constantly creating new production records. Young people on the agricultural front are shouting the slogan of realizing "four, five, eight" ahead of schedule and are fighting to win agricultural abundance. Young people in state organs and on the cultural and educational fronts have also bravely stood at the forefront of the leap forward by launching movements against waste and conservatism. Many young intellectuals have enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to go to the countryside and mountains to participate in agricultural production and physical labor. Among young people in the industrial and commercial sectors, a high level of enthusiasm has also been aroused, and they are willing to become self-reliant workers as soon as possible. The hard work of young people in all positions has powerfully promoted the development of socialist construction and made outstanding contributions to the motherland.

    However, we must also point out that not all young people have correct views and attitudes towards labor. For example, some young people in the industrial and commercial sectors are still not determined to change their life of living without labor, or they are not content with the work they are undertaking and are adopting a passive and perfunctory attitude; some young intellectuals look down on physical labor and are unwilling to go to the countryside and mountains; even among young workers and peasants, there are a very few who are afraid of hardship and lack a master's attitude towards labor. These phenomena reflect the exploitative class ideology of despising labor to varying degrees. If this ideology is not overcome in time, it will be impossible to further develop revolutionary drive and make greater contributions to socialism. Therefore, it is necessary for us to explain the glorious position and important significance of labor in socialist society.

    The working class and the working people, unlike the exploiting classes of the past, regard labor as a glorious and heroic cause. Because only labor can create material wealth for us; and only labor can produce all cultural and scientific knowledge. Today, our youth all hope to build our country into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. To realize this beautiful ideal, we must rely on the hard work of the people and youth of the whole country. Therefore, conscious young people should respect labor, love labor, and actively participate in labor. In particular, young people in the industrial and commercial sectors and other young people from exploiting classes should be determined to adapt to the historical trend, betray their own classes, participate in the ranks of the great working people, and should take the initiative to go to workshops, counters, and the countryside and mountains, implement integration with workers and peasants, learn from workers and peasants, develop labor habits, learn labor skills, and transform themselves into socialist laborers.

    When talking about loving labor, some young people are only willing to engage in mental labor and are unwilling to engage in physical labor, which is wrong. Despising physical labor is the ideology of the exploiting classes. Mental labor is important, but physical labor is even more important because it is the foundation of social existence and development, and it is the glorious task that the vast majority of people must undertake. In our socialist society, labor has no distinction between high and low, but is to closely integrate mental labor and physical labor. The direction of our young generation's efforts is to intellectualize young workers and peasants and to worker-peasantize young intellectuals, to become new people of socialism who combine mental labor and physical labor. At present, our country is vigorously promoting work-study programs and the participation of young intellectuals in industrial and agricultural production. This is a revolutionary measure to cultivate such new people. Chinese youth should actively support this measure and cultivate themselves into working-class intellectuals and cultured laborers who can withstand risks.

    Our country is still an economically backward country. To fundamentally change this situation, it requires the people and youth of the whole country to engage in long-term hard struggle. As the saying goes, only after suffering the most bitter hardships can one enjoy the sweetest happiness. Only through today's hard struggle can we achieve tomorrow's prosperity and strength. Since the rectification movement, a good atmosphere of hard struggle has formed among the broad masses of youth. The bourgeois ideology and style of pursuing enjoyment, seeking comfort, fearing hardship, avoiding difficulties, and not cherishing public property, which once existed among some young people, have been significantly changed. We should realize that to complete the great cause of building socialism, we will inevitably encounter many difficulties. Our youth should not be afraid of suffering, not be afraid of difficulties, and should bravely overcome difficulties. We should continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, vigorously implement the policy of building the country through diligence and frugality, running communes through diligence and frugality, running schools through diligence and frugality, running enterprises through diligence and frugality, running all undertakings through diligence and frugality, and managing households through diligence and frugality, in order to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically.

    The socialist cause requires people to give full play to their initiative and creativity. Chinese youth should give full play to their subjective initiative and actively promote the realization of everything that can be done through effort. Our youth should especially give play to the spirit of innovation, think boldly, delve deeply, dare to break through conservatism, break the "rules" that hinder advanced things, and become promoters of all new things. We should set such an ambition that doing things up to ordinary standards is only the most basic requirement, and doing everything possible to make things more perfect is our heroic nature.

    Building socialism requires developed culture, science, and technology. In the current high tide of socialist construction, our broad masses of youth are full of drive, which is very valuable. However, in order to promote the continuous leap forward in production, we must actively master science and technology on the basis of developing drive. With full labor enthusiasm and certain skills and culture, we can generate even greater strength. At present, people on all fronts, especially on the industrial and agricultural fronts, are working hard to study technology and reform tools, and a mass technical revolution movement has begun to sprout. At the same time, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people to learn culture is also very high, and running schools by the masses has become a trend. Under this situation, our national youth should, on the basis of raising their political and ideological consciousness, combine their work needs and work hard to study science and technology and professional skills. We must absorb useful knowledge from books and learn more in practice. We must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and we must also learn from the advanced experience of our own country. Young people should learn from the elderly, and at the same time, they should surpass their predecessors. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn things we do not understand. We must learn economic work from all insiders (no matter who they are). Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, learn honestly. If you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand. ... Dig into it, a few months, a year or two, three or five years, you can always learn it." Only when we are both red and expert can we show our great talents in the great cause of building socialism.

    Comrades Delegates, the cause we are now engaged in is a great cause unprecedented in history. We must build a country with a large population and relatively backward economy and culture into a socialist power with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in just over a dozen years. Completing this cause is arduous, but the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao contain endless power. Once this power is stimulated, it is like the nucleus of an atom being broken through, and it can create any miracle. Young people who have been educated by the Chinese Communist Party have always been the heroic shock force of the people. Every one of us young people should, in this unprecedentedly great and good time, exert all efforts, develop a spirit of intensive study, and build socialism together with the people of the whole country in a lively and happy manner. In particular, we must always remember the encouragement that our great leader Chairman Mao made to the youth. He said: "Youth is the most active and vigorous force in the entire social force. They are the most willing to learn and have the least conservative ideas, especially in the socialist era." We hope that the national youth will never fail to live up to Chairman Mao's encouragement to us and become successors that the revolutionary elders can trust.

            (IV)

    To build our country, we must unite all forces that can be united. Chairman Mao taught us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the inevitable victory of our cause." Therefore, young people of all nationalities, all classes, and all different religious beliefs in our country should cherish this unity and solidarity and should play an exemplary role in the struggle to maintain this unity and solidarity.

    Since the national liberation, with the development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, the unity of the national youth has been continuously consolidated and expanded. Under the conditions that socialist transformation has been basically completed, counter-revolutionary elements have been basically eliminated, and the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts has achieved great victory, further consolidating and expanding the unity of the national youth has a broader foundation.

    Our country is a unified socialist country with multiple nationalities. Socialism embodies the common interests of all nationalities in our country and the highest interests of the motherland. Young people of all nationalities should closely unite under the banner of socialism and work together to enhance the unity between all nationalities. The reactionary ruling classes of the old society created hostile events between nationalities, spread seeds of hatred, and prevented nationalities from cooperating closely and developing together, so that they remained in poverty and backwardness for a long time. In the past few years since liberation, due to the implementation of the Party's ethnic policies and the increase in mutual exchanges and learning between nationalities, the historical legacy of ethnic discrimination and mutual distrust has undergone fundamental changes; and the economic and cultural backwardness of all nationalities has been rapidly changed. In order to enhance the unity of all nationalities, we have focused on criticizing Han chauvinism, and in the future, we should also pay attention to preventing and overcoming this wrong thinking. Recent facts show that among some young people of minority nationalities, local nationalism has grown, and some people with ulterior motives, regardless of the overall interests of the motherland and the nationality, exaggerate the particularity of the nationality, exclude the help of the Han nationality, oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, and attempt to split the unity of the motherland. This reactionary bourgeois local nationalism has aroused the serious vigilance and opposition of all conscious young people of minority nationalities. Han chauvinist thought and local nationalist thought are both great enemies of the unity of the motherland and the socialist cause, and they are both bad things left over from the old society. All young people who love socialism should never let it hinder our progress, but should resolutely eliminate it. We should unite the interests of our own nationality with the interests of the people of the whole country. Only the unity, consolidation, and strength of the motherland's big family are the guarantee of the happiness of all nationalities. Young people of all our nationalities should further strengthen unity, learn from each other, help each other, respect each other's customs, develop the fine traditions of their own nationalities, and eliminate backward customs that hinder social progress.

    We must strengthen the unity of young people from all walks of life on the ideological and political basis of patriotism and socialism. Young workers and peasants should be good at uniting and helping young people from other walks of life to advance together. Young people from other walks of life should actively learn from young workers and peasants.

    The Chinese Communist Youth League is a mass organization of advanced young people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and is the core force of our country's youth movement. All youth organizations should establish closer ties and cooperation with the Communist Youth League. We believe that all members of the Communist Youth League and the cadres of the League will further develop the fine style of closely linking with the masses, humbly learn from the broad masses of youth, and be good at patiently providing the broad masses of youth with all necessary help, and gain the trust of the broad masses of youth with their exemplary behavior of suffering before others and enjoying after others.

    In order to strengthen unity, our youth must be good at distinguishing between two types of contradictions that are different in nature. We should maintain high vigilance against the remaining counter-revolutionary elements and various anti-socialist elements, and we should wage a relentless struggle against them to prevent them from undermining our unity and socialist cause. However, for young people within the people who have general erroneous ideas, speeches, and behaviors, we should adhere to the policy of "unity-criticism-unity," adopt democratic discussion and full reasoning methods, and patiently help them raise their awareness and correct their mistakes.

    At present, our country's rectification movement is continuing to deepen. Our country's self-transformation movement of young people from all walks of life is intensifying on a conscious basis. With the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the youth, the unity and solidarity of our country's youth under the banner of socialism will be more consolidated and developed.

            (V)

    Our country's youth shoulder important tasks in international activities.

    Maintaining peace is the common interest of the people of the world today. Our country's socialist construction also needs a peaceful international environment. Therefore, the primary task of our country's youth international activities is to unite and cooperate with the youth of all countries in the world to jointly oppose the imperialist warmongering group headed by the United States and strive for lasting world peace.

    Since the last National Youth Congress, our country's youth international activities have been greatly developed. We have participated in many international youth conferences and conducted bilateral friendly activities. In the past five years, we have received 4,035 young friends from 89 countries to conduct friendly visits to our country, and we have also sent 3,312 youth representatives to visit 29 countries, greatly developing friendship with the youth of various countries.

    Our country has formed a close unity with the youth of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. This unity is based on the ideological consistency of Marxism-Leninism and the goal consistency of building socialist communism, and therefore, it is unbreakable. The youth of all socialist countries are like brothers and sisters living in a harmonious big family, always learning from each other and supporting each other.

    Our friendly relations with the youth of many Asian and African countries have greatly developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We have developed friendly exchanges with the youth of India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Nepal, etc., and strengthened ties and friendship with the United Arab Republic and other Arab countries. Our exchanges with the youth of neighboring Japan have greatly developed. We have also exchanged visits with the youth of African countries. This mutual friendly exchange has brought new development to the traditional friendship between our country and the people of Asian and African countries.

    We are very pleased to see that recently, the anti-colonialist struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have reached a new high. We strongly support the anti-colonialist struggles carried out by the youth of various countries to strive for national independence, and we firmly believe that their struggles will surely achieve final victory.

    Our country's youth have always been willing to develop friendly cooperation with the youth of all countries, including the United States, and we will continue to make unremitting efforts to realize this wish. Last year, 42 American youth, regardless of the threats and obstruction of the US government, came to our country for a 40-day friendly visit, which shows that the US imperialism's policy of hostility towards New China is unpopular. The desire of young people of all countries to have friendly ties with our country's youth cannot be blocked by anyone.

    We approve of the efforts made by the World Federation of Democratic Youth in recent years to strengthen the unity and cooperation of youth in various countries. The World Federation of Democratic Youth has made significant contributions in uniting youth of various countries to fight for peace, oppose aggression, strive for national independence, and protect the vital interests of youth. Our country's youth have always supported its various activities and will continue to contribute our strength in the future.

    Our country's youth must constantly improve their internationalist thinking. Our Party often teaches us that countries, regardless of size, have their fine traditions and advanced things. Our country's youth must care about the lives and struggles of the people and youth of various countries, and humbly learn all advanced knowledge and experience from the people and youth of various countries, so as to facilitate the construction of our socialist country and promote friendly cooperation with various countries.

    Comrades Delegates, the current international and domestic situations are conducive to our socialist construction. A beautiful prospect of the motherland has already been presented before us. Our generation of youth is happy, and the responsibility is also great. Chairman Mao said: "You young people are full of vigor and are in a flourishing period, like the sun at eight or nine o'clock in the morning. Hope is placed on you." The younger generation of our country will certainly not fail to live up to the expectations of our great leader. We must closely unite around the Party and resolutely take the socialist road. We must carry forward the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle, unite as one, work heroically, overcome various difficulties, and build our great socialist motherland.

    Let us ride the wind and waves and bravely move forward!

    鼓足干劲，力争上游，在社会主义大跃进中起先锋作用
    中华全国民主青年联合会第二届委员会向全国青年第三次代表大会的报告
    刘西元各位代表：
    我受中华全国民主青年联合会第二届委员会的委托，向大会作报告。
            （一）
    五年前，当我们召开第二次代表大会的时候，正是我国发展国民经济第一个五年计划开始的一年。而今天，规模更为宏伟的发展国民经济第二个五年计划又已经开始了。祖国飞跃前进的景象鼓舞着我们。我们每一个青年都应该坚决地为社会主义建设做出更大的贡献。
    我们的时代，是一个不平凡的时代。在短短的几年中，中国人民以排山倒海的气概，一个革命接着一个革命地向前跃进着。1949年，我们在全国范围内建立了人民政权以后，接着就进行了土地改革。土地改革一完成，就开始了对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造。在社会主义的三大改造，也就是生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命基本完成之后，我国人民又在去年开始了全民性的整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的斗争，在这场政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命取得了决定性胜利的基础上，现在全国又出现了空前高涨的社会主义建设高潮。农村中，数亿农民在“苦战三年，改变农村面貌”的口号下，展开了气壮山河的改造自然、争取大丰收的英勇斗争。厂矿企业和机关学校中，掀起了轰轰烈烈的反浪费反保守的革命浪潮。鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，已成为广大人民的行动口号。一个全民性的比先进、赶先进的社会主义大竞赛，已经形成。许多过去做不到的事情，现在可以做到了，过去要花很长时间才能办到的事情，现在短时间内就能完成了。这一切表明，我们的民族是大有希望的，我们的祖国是有着无限光明的前途。还在新中国诞生的前夕，毛主席就这样地指出：“中国人民将会看见，中国的命运一经操在人民自己的手里，中国就将如太阳升起在东方那样，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照大地……。”几年来的事实，越来越鲜明生动地证实了毛主席的伟大预言。
    现在，我们党向全国人民提出的新的伟大目标：在十五年或者更多一点时间内，在钢铁及其他主要工业生产品方面赶上或者超过英国；提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）；在不太长的时间内，在急需的科学技术部门接近或者达到世界先进水平；以便使我国成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义强国。这是一个伟大而又艰巨的任务。我国人民有充分的信心来完成这个历史任务。因为我们有伟大、光荣、正确的中国共产党的领导，有无比优越的社会主义制度，有组织起来的亿万人民无穷的智慧和力量。过去几年来，我国青年无论是在社会主义革命的斗争中，无论是在各种建设岗位上，始终是最热情、最活跃、最勇敢的力量；在青年中涌现出了成千上万的英雄、模范和先进人物。今天，我国青年在新的伟大历史任务面前，更应该鼓起干劲，力争上游，在社会主义大跃进中起先锋作用。
            （二）
    我们的时代是社会主义大跃进的时代。我国的工农业生产正在大跃进，广大人民的思想也在大跃进。有着光荣革命传统的我国青年，一向是站在时代的前列。经过整风和反右派斗争以后，广大青年思想上受到了深刻的锻炼，政治觉悟有了很大的提高。他们进一步地认清了国家的前途，认清了自己的责任，更加热爱共产党，热爱社会主义。比思想、比干劲，在青年中已形成了广泛的热潮。在社会主义大跃进的形势下，大家都感觉到要继续提高觉悟，改造自己，自觉地过好社会主义这一关，在思想上也来一个大跃进，把自己锻炼成为社会主义的新人。
    新的时代要求我们有新的思想。今天整个世界已经是东风压倒西风，社会主义成了时代的主流。我们国家也完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义革命，建立了社会主义制度。社会主义是幸福的泉源，它促进了我国经济文化各方面事业的飞跃发展，它为我国人民和青年开辟了无限光明美好的前途。社会主义是历史发展的必然趋势，是不可拒抗的力量，任何人要违反历史的潮流，就必然要遭到可耻的失败。去年资产阶级右派向社会主义猖狂进攻，被全国人民所粉碎，就是一个有力的证明。社会主义制度，要求人们树立和它相适应的社会主义思想，清除旧社会遗留下来的资产阶级思想。资产阶级思想，是资本主义社会的上层建筑，它对社会主义社会经常起腐蚀和破坏作用，与新社会水火不相容。我们这一代青年，特别是剥削阶级出身的青年，还没有完全摆脱旧社会的思想影响。旧社会的统治阶级，特别是资产阶级，曾经用它们的政治观点和学术思想、它们的人生观和道德观来影响我们。而且它们至今也还利用人们的习惯势力和传统的偏见，来不断地影响我们的思想。资产阶级思想，对于我们来说，是一种严重的危害。它使我们不能正确认识客观事物，它束缚了我们的积极性和创造性，它使我们和新社会不能完全相适应，甚至产生无穷的苦恼。因此我们要自觉地努力改造思想，使自己从资产阶级思想影响下彻底解放出来。
    进行思想改造，是要求我们从资产阶级立场或动摇的中间状态转变过来，坚决地站在社会主义的立场上，把自己的心交给共产党，交给社会主义；还要求我们清除资产阶级个人主义思想，树立工人阶级集体主义思想。要做到像刘少奇同志所指示的，“全心全意为工人农民服务，为社会主义服务，把个人利益放在大众的集体利益之中，而不是放在大众的集体利益之上。”
    人人需要思想改造。毛主席说：“在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造，剥削者要改造，劳动者也要改造，谁说工人阶级不要改造？当然，剥削者的改造和劳动者的改造是两种不同性质的改造，不能混为一谈。”连工人阶级都要改造自己，难道还有什么人不需要改造？有些青年以这种理由或那种理由为借口，认为自己不需要改造了，显然是不对的。我们还必须了解，社会主义的发展速度是很快的，人们的思想很容易落后于客观实际。落后了，我们若不肯努力赶上去，就有可能发展成为社会前进的障碍。所以我们青年必须不断地改造自己，经常保持旺盛的革命意志和对新鲜事物的高度敏感，永远向前看，才能成为社会主义事业的促进派。
    人人可以改造，但是改造并非轻而易举。我们若把改造看得太容易，以为既然是“存在决定意识”，今天自己生活在社会主义社会里，或者自己的经济地位已经随着社会主义改造而改变，思想意识会自然而然地改造好；那就会妨碍自己去自觉努力改造。人们的思想意识的改变，总是落后于自己的社会经济地位的变化。所以改造旧的思想意识，要比改造旧的生产关系更困难些，更需要时间。而且思想意识的改造是要从资产阶级立场彻底转变到工人阶级立场上来，这是一个根本的转变，需要经过长期的甚至痛苦的磨练。工商界青年要脱胎换骨，洗面革心，当然不容易；资产阶级知识分子要彻底改造自己也不容易。至于工农青年，要经常洗刷自己身上的资产阶级思想的灰尘，使自己思想能适应客观形势飞跃的变化，也非自觉努力改造不可。
    正确地理解政治和业务的关系，使我们能更深刻地了解改造的必要。毛主席教导我们说，思想和政治是统帅，是灵魂，没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。有些青年说：“我只要有本领，问不问政治，都一样可以为社会主义服务。这一种思想是不对的。任何人都不可能脱离政治，要么是无产阶级的政治，要么是资产阶级的政治。一个人没有无产阶级政治观点，没有社会主义思想，纵然他有一些本领，也不可能很好地为社会主义服务，甚至可能走向反动的道路。去年夏季资产阶级右派向党和社会主义猖狂进攻期间，有些青年正由于平日不大过问政治，受到资产阶级思想的侵蚀，因而经受不住风浪，站不稳脚跟，有的甚至堕落成右派。我们党和国家对青年的期望，是要我们既有坚定的政治立场，又有熟练的业务能力，要我们又红又专。
    思想改造的一个最大目的，是使我们的主观认识和客观世界取得一致，使自己从资产阶级的偏见和愚昧中彻底解放出来，能主动地去改造客观世界，求得真正的思想自由。资产阶级也叫喊“思想自由”，可是他们由于受着本阶级偏见的限制，永远无法正确认识客观世界。人们只有消灭了资产阶级思想，树立了社会主义思想，才能认清客观世界的发展规律与主观努力的具体道路，才能从盲目服从客观世界的支配转到主动地掌握自己的命运，才能在思想上获得真正的自由。
    思想改造的胜利，要依靠我们的自觉和决心，坚持不懈地去进行。改造的途径是努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习时事政策，并且联系社会实际和自己的思想实际来学习，是要积极参加社会主义的劳动和斗争。在知识青年当中，特别应当加强体力劳动的锻炼。自觉地参加劳动锻炼，积极投入伟大的社会主义事业中去，在改造客观世界的过程中不断改造自己，我们就能够做名副其实的社会主义的新人。
            （三）
    我们全国青年不仅要坚持社会主义政治方向，树立工人阶级思想，而且要积极参加社会主义的建设，在建设社会主义的伟大事业中建立功勋。
    在目前全国大跃进的形势中，各个战线上的青年发挥了社会主义积极性，以英勇卓绝的劳动，成为大跃进中极为活跃的力量。工业战线上的青年，以赶上和超过英国为己志，不断地创造新的生产纪录。农业战线上的青年，高喊着提前实现“四、五、八”，为争取农业丰产而斗争。国家机关和文教战线上的青年，通过反浪费反保守运动，也奋勇地站在跃进高潮的前面。许多知识青年热烈地响应了党的号召，
  下乡上山参加农业生产和体力劳动。在工商界
  青年中，也同样激起了高涨的热情，愿意尽早成为自食其力的劳动者。所有各个岗位上的青年的辛勤劳动，都有力地促进社会主义建设事业的发展，为祖国作出了出色的贡献。
    但是，我们也不能不指出：并不是所有的青年对于劳动都有正确的观点和态度的。例如有些工商界青年仍然没有决心改变不劳而食的生活，或者不安于自己所担负的工作，抱着消极应付的态度；有些知识青年轻视体力劳动，不愿意下乡上山；即使在工农青年中，也有极少数人害怕艰苦，缺乏主人翁的劳动态度。这些现象都反映了不同程度的轻视劳动的剥削阶级思想，这种思想如不及时克服，就不可能进一步发扬革命干劲，对社会主义作出更大的贡献。因此，我们有必要说明一下劳动在社会主义社会里的光荣地位和重要意义。
    工人阶级和劳动人民跟历来的剥削阶级相反，是把劳动看成光荣而豪迈的事业。因为只有劳动，才能为我们创造物质财富；也只有劳动，才能产生一切文化科学知识。今天我们青年都希望把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国，要实现这个美好的理想，就必须靠全国人民和青年的辛勤劳动。因此，有觉悟的青年都应该尊重劳动，热爱劳动，积极参加劳动。特别是工商界青年和其他出身于剥削阶级的青年，要决心适应历史潮流，背叛自己的阶级，参加伟大的劳动人民的行列，更应该主动下车间，上柜台，下乡上山，实行和工农结合，向工农学习，养成劳动习惯，学会劳动本领，把自己改造成为社会主义的劳动者。
    当谈到应当热爱劳动的时候，有些青年只愿意从事脑力劳动，不愿意从事体力劳动，这是不对的。轻视体力劳动，是剥削阶级的思想。脑力劳动固然重要，体力劳动由于它是社会存在和发展的基础，是最大多数人民都要担负的光荣任务，所以更为重要。在我们社会主义社会里，劳动是没有贵贱之分的，是要使脑力劳动和体力劳动密切结合起来。我们青年一代的努力方向，就是要工农青年知识化，知识青年工农化，成为脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的社会主义新人。目前我们国家正在大力提倡勤工俭学和知识青年参加工农业生产，这是培养这种新人的革命措施。我国青年应当积极拥护这种措施，把自己培养成为能经得起风险的工人阶级知识分子和有文化的劳动者。
    我们国家目前在经济上仍是一个落后的国家，要从根本上改变这种情况，需要全国人民和青年作较长期的艰苦奋斗。俗语说，吃尽苦中苦，才有甜上甜。只有今天的艰苦奋斗，才有明天的繁荣富强。自从整风运动以来，在广大青年中已形成了艰苦奋斗的良好风气。过去曾经在一些青年中存在的追求享受、贪图安逸、害怕艰苦、逃避困难、不爱惜公共财物的资产阶级思想作风，已有显著的改变。我们应该认识，要完成建设社会主义的伟大事业，一定会遇到许多困难。我们青年应当不怕吃苦，不怕困难，并且要勇敢地战胜困难。我们应该继续发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，大力贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭办校、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业和勤俭持家的方针，以求更多、更快、更好、更省地建设社会主义。
    社会主义事业要求人们发挥最大的积极性和创造性。我国青年应该充分发挥主观能动作用，凡是一切经过努力可以办到的事，都要积极促其实现。我们青年特别要发挥革新精神，大胆地想，深入地钻，勇于冲破保守，打破妨碍先进事物的“常规”，成为一切新鲜事物的促进派。我们应该立下这样一个雄心，认为把事情做得合乎普通规格，只是最起码的要求，而尽一切可能把事情做得更加完美，才是我们的英雄本色。
    建设社会主义需要有发达的文化科学和技术。在目前社会主义建设的高潮中，我们广大青年干劲十足，这是十分可贵的。但是，为了促进生产的不断跃进，必须在发扬干劲的基础上，积极掌握科学技术。有了饱满的劳动热情，又有了一定的技术和文化，才能产生更为巨大的力量。现在各个战线上特别是工农业战线上的人民，正在努力钻研技术、改革工具，一个群众性的技术革命运动已经开始萌芽。与此同时，广大劳动人民学习文化的积极性也非常高涨，群众办学，已形成风气。在这种形势下，我们全国青年都应当在提高政治思想觉悟的基础上，结合工作需要，努力学习科学技术和业务本领。我们要从书本中吸取有用的知识，更要在实践中学习。我们要学习苏联和其他社会主义国家的先进经验，也要学习本国的先进经验。青年人应该向老年人学习，同时还要青出于蓝而胜于蓝。我们要记住毛主席的教导：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。……钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”只有我们做到又红又专，才能在建设社会主义的伟大事业中大显身手。
    各位代表，我们现在所从事的事业，是亘古未有的伟大事业。我们要在短短的十几年中，把一个人口众多、经济和文化都比较落后的国家建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。完成这个事业是艰巨的，但是，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下的中国人民，蕴藏着无穷无尽的力量，这个力量一经激发出来，就像原子核被冲破了一样，可以创造任何奇迹。在中国共产党教养下的青年，一向是人民中的英勇的突击队，我们每一个青年都应该在这个空前未有的大好时光，鼓足干劲，发扬钻劲，和全国人民一起，热热闹闹地兴高采烈地建设社会主义。我们特别要时刻记住我们伟大领袖毛主席对青年所作的勉励。他说：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”我们希望全国青年永远不辜负毛主席对我们的勉励，成为革命长辈可以信任的接班人。
            （四）
    要建设我们的国家，就必须团结一切可能团结的力量。毛主席教导我们说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”因此，我国各民族、各阶层、各种不同宗教信仰的青年，应该十分珍视这种统一和团结，应该在维护这种统一和团结的斗争中起模范作用。
    自全国解放以来，随着社会主义革命和社会主义建设的发展，全国青年的团结不断地巩固和扩大。在今天社会主义改造已经基本完成、反革命分子已经基本肃清、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命已经取得伟大胜利的条件下，进一步巩固和扩大全国青年的团结，就有了更加广泛的基础。
    我国是一个统一的多民族的社会主义国家。社会主义体现了我国各民族的共同利益和祖国的最高利益。各民族青年都应该在社会主义旗帜下亲密团结起来，共同为增进各民族之间的团结而努力。旧社会的反动统治阶级，在各民族间制造敌对事件，散布仇视的种子，使各民族不能亲密合作，共同发展，因而都长期停留在贫困落后的境地。解放几年来，由于党的民族政策的实施，各民族间互相往来和互相学习的增多，历史上遗留下来的民族歧视、互不信任的情况，有了根本的改变；而各民族的经济文化落后的面貌已在迅速改观。为了增进各民族的团结，我们曾着重批判了大汉族主义，今后还应当注意防止和克服这种错误思想。最近的一些事实表明，在一部分少数民族青年中，地方民族主义的思想有所滋长，一些别有用心的人不顾祖国和民族的整体利益，夸大民族的特殊性，排斥汉族的帮助，反对共产党的领导，企图分裂祖国的统一。这种反动的资产阶级地方民族主义，已经引起了一切有觉悟的少数民族青年的严重警惕和反对。大汉族主义思想和地方民族主义思想，都是危害祖国统一和社会主义事业的大敌，都是旧社会遗留下来的坏东西。所有热爱社会主义的青年，决不应该让它绊住我们前进的脚步，而要坚决地把它清除掉。我们应该把本民族的利益和全国人民的利益统一起来。只有祖国大家庭的团结、巩固和强大，才是各族人民幸福的保证。我们各民族的青年，都应该进一步加强团结、相互学习、相互帮助、相互尊重风俗习惯；都应该发扬本民族的优良传统，破除阻碍社会前进的落后的风俗习惯。
    我们要在爱国主义和社会主义的思想基础和政治基础上，加强各界青年的团结。工农青年要善于团结和帮助其他各界青年共同前进。其他各界青年要积极地向工农青年学习。
    中国共产主义青年团是在中国共产党领导下的先进青年的群众组织，是我国青年运动的核心力量。各个青年组织要与共青团取得更密切的联系和合作。我们相信全体共青团员和团的干部，将会进一步发扬密切联系群众的优良作风，虚心地向广大青年群众学习，并且善于耐心地给予广大青年以一切必要的帮助，以自己吃苦在先、得利在后的模范行为，取得广大青年的信任。
    为了加强团结，我们青年要善于区别两类性质不同的矛盾。我们对于残余的反革命分子和各种反社会主义分子，应该保持高度的警惕，要向他们进行无情的斗争，不让他们破坏我们的团结和社会主义事业。但是，对于人民内部有一般错误思想、言论和行为的青年，我们就要坚持“团结——批评——团结”的方针，采取民主讨论、充分说理的方法，耐心地帮助他们提高觉悟，改正错误。
    目前，我国人民的整风运动，正在继续深入地开展。我国各界青年的自我改造运动，正在自觉的基础上加紧进行。随着青年的社会主义觉悟的提高，我国青年在社会主义旗帜下的统一和团结，一定会更加巩固和发展。
            （五）
    我国青年在国际活动中担负着重要的任务。
    维护和平，是当前世界人民的共同利益。我国的社会主义建设也需要有一个和平的国际环境。因此，我国青年国际活动的首要任务就是要和世界各国青年团结合作，共同反对以美国为首的帝国主义好战集团，争取世界持久和平。
    自从上次全国青年代表大会以来，我国青年的国际活动有了很大的开展。我们参加了许多国际青年会议，进行了双边友好活动。五年来，我们接待了八十九个国家的四千零三十五位青年朋友来我国进行友好访问，同时也派出了青年代表三千三百一十二人访问了二十九个国家，大大地发展了同各国青年的友谊。
    我国同苏联和其他社会主义国家青年结成了亲密的团结，这种团结是建立在马克思列宁主义思想一致和建设社会主义共产主义目标一致的基础上的，因而是牢不可破的。各社会主义国家的青年像生活在一个和睦的大家庭中的兄弟姊妹一样，永远互相学习和互相支援。
    我们同亚非许多国家青年的友好关系，在和平共处的五项原则的基础上，有了很大的发展。我们发展了同印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、尼泊尔等国青年的友好往来，加强了同阿拉伯联合共和国及其他阿拉伯国家青年的联系与友谊。我们同近邻日本青年的往来有了很大的发展。我们同非洲国家的青年也彼此进行了访问。这种相互友好往来，使我国同亚非各国人民的传统友谊，得到了新的发展。
    我们很高兴地看到，最近以来，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的反殖民主义的斗争，有了新的高涨。我们大力支持各国青年为争取民族独立所进行的反殖民主义的斗争，并且深信，他们的斗争必然会得到最后的胜利。
    我国青年一向愿意同包括美国在内的一切国家的青年发展友好合作，我们坚定不移地为实现这个愿望而继续努力。去年，四十二位美国青年，不顾美国政府的威胁和阻挠，来我国进行了四十天的友好访问的事实，说明了美帝国主义敌视新中国的政策是不得人心的。各国青年希望同我国青年友好联系的愿望是任何人也阻挡不了的。
    我们赞同世界民主青年联盟近几年来为加强各国青年的团结合作所作的努力。世界民主青年联盟在团结各国青年争取和平、反对侵略战争、争取民族独立和青年切身利益的斗争中，作出了重大的贡献。我国青年一向支持它的各项活动，并将在今后继续贡献我们的力量。
    我国青年必须不断地提高国际主义思想。我们的党经常教导我们，国家无分大小，都有它的优良传统和先进的事物。我国青年要关心各国人民和青年的生活与斗争，虚心地向各国人民和青年学习一切先进的知识和经验，以利于建设我们社会主义的国家和促进与各国的友好合作。
    各位代表，目前的国际形势和国内形势，都有利于我们的社会主义建设。祖国的一幅美好的前景已经呈现在我们面前。我们这一代青年是幸福的，责任也是重大的。毛主席说：“你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好像早晨八、九点钟的太阳，希望寄托在你们身上。”我国的年轻一代，一定不会辜负我们伟大领袖对我们的期望。我们要紧密地团结在党的周围，坚决地走社会主义道路。我们要发扬艰苦奋斗的革命传统，万众一心，英勇劳动，战胜各种困难，建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国。
    让我们乘风破浪，勇敢地前进吧！
