    Relying on the Masses to Find Water Sources and Think of Solutions
    Drought-Stricken Areas of Guizhou and Sichuan Basically Achieve Timely Sowing
    (Our dispatch) Guizhou's various ethnic groups of farmers are launching a drought-resistant spring planting campaign.
    In the past two months, it has rarely rained in the Guizhou area, and in some areas it has not rained at all. At present, in the two severely drought-stricken areas of Anshun and Bijie, more than one million farmers are irrigating drought-stricken farmland day and night, striving to sow major autumn crops in a timely manner. As of early April, the province had sown about 25% of the planned area for corn and rice, generally achieving timely sowing.
    In the drought-resistant sowing campaign, all localities have given full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. According to preliminary statistics, the masses in Jinsha County have already found twenty-three drought-resistant and rush-planting methods, such as building dams to divert water, tiered waterwheels, old farmers finding water sources, blocking sinkholes, and raising and compacting field ridges. Among these, the blocking of sinkholes alone has irrigated more than 40,000 mu of fields in the Yumo district. (Yang Xuanzhi)
    (Our dispatch) Sichuan farmers, with drought prevention and resistance as the central focus of spring plowing production, have victoriously completed the sowing and planting plans for various crops after more than half a month of hard work. At present, the early rice transplanting is nearing completion, and the sowing of mid-season rice and cotton is being fully launched. Recently, there has been rainfall across the province, and some special zones have shifted from drought resistance to water storage and conservation, striving for full planting as the central task.

    依靠群众找水源想办法
    贵州四川受旱地区基本做到适时播种
    本报讯　贵州部分地区各族农民正开展抗旱春播运动。
    近两个月来，贵州地区很少下雨，有的地区甚至没有下雨。目前受旱较重的安顺和毕节两个专区，百多万农民日夜灌溉受旱农田，争取及时播种大秋作物。截至4月上旬，全省播种的玉米和水稻已占应播种面积的25％左右，一般都作到了适时播种。
    各地在抗旱播种运动中，充分发挥了群众的积极性和创造性。据初步统计，金沙县群众已经找到了拦河筑坝引水、层层车水、老农找水源、堵塞落水洞和加高捶紧田坎等二十三项抗旱抢种办法。其中如堵塞落水洞一项，禹谟区即灌田四万多亩。　（杨炫之）
    本报讯　四川农民以防旱抗旱为中心的春耕生产，经过半个多月苦战，各种作物的播种、栽插计划都已胜利实现。目前，早稻栽插即将结束，中稻、棉花播种正全面展开。近日，全省降雨，部分专区已从抗旱转为蓄水保水，争取满栽满插为中心。
