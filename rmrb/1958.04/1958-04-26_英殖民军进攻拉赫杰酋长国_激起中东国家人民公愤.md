Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Mohammed Ali Jiffri, Speaker of the Lahej Legislative Council and Chairman of the People's League of South Arabia, who was recently pursued by the British authorities in Aden and fled to Taiz, Yemen, said that Britain used seventy tanks and armored vehicles in its recent sudden attack on the Lahej Sultanate. He said that Britain's attack and intimidation of Lahej nationalists is intended to realize the imperialists' sinister conspiracy in southern Yemen. The rampant offensive of the British colonial army has aroused widespread protests from the public in Middle Eastern countries. The People's League of South Arabia, from various emirates in the "Aden Protectorate," sent a telegram to the British authorities in Aden, condemning Britain's brutal and terrorist actions against the Lahej Sultanate and demanding the release of the league's member, Dulla Jiffri, the education administrator of the Lahej Sultanate (who is a brother of the league's chairman who fled to Taiz, Yemen).
    The International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions issued a statement on the 24th, expressing its support for the general strike scheduled for the 25th by Aden workers to protest the ordinances formulated by British imperialists to deprive them of their freedom and rights.
    It also called on all Arab workers to support the Aden workers, just as they supported Egypt during the Suez War.
    On the same day, trade union organizations in the Syrian region also expressed the support of Syrian workers for the struggle of Aden workers.
    The Cairo newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 23rd on Britain's attack on Lahej, saying that just as Egypt, Syria, Tunisia, Morocco, Ghana, and all other peoples engaged in the anti-imperialist struggle, the people of Aden will achieve final victory.

    英殖民军进攻拉赫杰酋长国
    激起中东国家人民公愤
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：最近被亚丁的英国当局搜捕而逃到也门塔兹的拉赫杰立法议会议长、南方阿拉伯人民联盟主席穆罕默德·阿里·吉弗里说，英国最近对拉赫杰酋长国发动的突然进攻时使用了七十辆坦克和装甲车。他说，英国对拉赫杰民族主义者的进攻和恫吓是为了想在也门南部实现帝国主义的罪恶预谋。英国殖民军队的猖狂进攻，已经激起了中东各国公众的一片抗议声。“亚丁保护地”各酋长国中的南方阿拉伯人民联盟打电报给亚丁的英国当局，谴责英国对拉赫杰酋长国采取的残暴和恐怖行动，并且要求释放联盟的成员、拉赫杰酋长国的教育行政官杜拉·吉弗里（他是逃往也门塔兹的这个联盟主席的兄弟）。
    阿拉伯工会国际联合会24日发表声明，表示支持亚丁工人预定在25日为抗议英帝国主义者制订剥夺他们的自由和权利的法令而举行的总罢工。
    它还号召全体阿拉伯工人支持亚丁工人，正如他们在苏伊士战事期间支持埃及一样。
    同一天，叙利亚地区的工会组织也表示叙利亚工人支持亚丁工人的斗争。
    开罗“人民报”23日就英国对拉赫杰的进攻发表社论说，正如埃及、叙利亚、突尼斯、摩洛哥、加纳和一切正在进行反帝国主义斗争的其他人民一样，亚丁人民将取得最后胜利。
