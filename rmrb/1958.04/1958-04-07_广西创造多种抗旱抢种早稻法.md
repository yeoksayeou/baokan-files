Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 6th: The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi have created many methods to combat drought and rush to transplant early rice seedlings. As of April 1st, more than 4.75 million mu have been transplanted.

The Bangong Agricultural Cooperative in Liucheng County diverted spring water into a ditch, used it in a concentrated manner, irrigated and harrowed one field at a time. At the same time, the water was stored in the already harrowed fields. After the water was full, they opened the fields around the perimeter to release the water, allowing the water to rush to the unharrowed fields in all directions. More than ten cattle immediately followed the water to harrow and transplant, and more than 20 mu were transplanted in two days. Farmers in Longjin County also adopted the "fertilizer planting method" and the "two-to-one wet fertilizer seed mixing and sowing method" to fight drought and rush planting. The former method involves placing moist pond mud in the furrows first, then sowing the rice seeds, and then covering them with a small amount of moist soil. The latter method is to mix two parts of wet fertilizer, one part of dry fertilizer, and seeds, then add a small amount of lime before sowing. These two methods are better than dry direct seeding, can emerge earlier, the seedlings emerge evenly, and can also resist drought for about ten days. Some counties have also implemented the adjustment of labor between areas with and without water to support each other and grab water to rush to transplant.

All localities have made full use of existing field water and saved water during the drought resistance efforts. Dawang Township in Rong County ranked the paddy fields, transplanted dry fields first, then paddy fields, and all production teams set up full-time cadres to manage water use. After rational water use, Longtian Cooperative in Guixian County irrigated 120 more mu of land. The entire Tuoying Cooperative in the county blocked the Tuoying River and made a large manual water spray tube out of bamboo, so that more than 40 mu of dry land on the high mountains were also fully planted with rice seedlings.

There has been little rainfall in Guangxi this spring, and the entire region is showing signs of drought. Some counties have experienced severe drought, with no water in mountain ponds and reservoirs, and one-third to one-half of the paddy fields lacking water for transplanting. Under the slogan of "If the sky doesn't rain, don't rely on the sky. If there is no pond water, pump river water. Fight hard for ten days and ten nights, and resolutely plant the seedlings," the people of all ethnic groups are fighting drought and transplanting seedlings.

### 广西创造多种抗旱抢种早稻法

    广西创造多种抗旱抢种早稻法
    新华社南宁6日电　广西各族人民创造了许多抗旱抢插早稻秧的办法，到4月1日止，已插秧四百七十五万多亩。
    柳城县板贡农业社，把泉水引入一条水沟，集中使用，灌一块田就耙一块田，同时把水储在已耙过的田里，等储满后，在四周一起开口放水，使水冲到四面八方未耙的田里，立即用十多头牛紧跟水头抢耙抢插，两天就插秧二十多亩。龙津县的农民还采用了“施肥种植法”和“二比一湿肥拌种播种法”抗旱抢种。前一方法是将潮湿的塘泥先放在垅沟里，后播稻种，再盖上少量的湿土。后一方法是用二分湿肥、一分干肥和种子混合起来，再加少量石灰，然后下种。这两种方法比旱直播还好，可以提前出苗，苗出的均匀，并且还能抗旱十天左右。有些县还实行了有水和无水地区调节劳力，互相支援，抢水抢插。
    各地在抗旱中充分利用现有田水和节约用水。容县大王乡将水田排队，先插旱田，后插水田，所有生产队都设专职干部管理用水。贵县龙田社合理用水后，多灌了一百二十亩田。全县驮英社把一条驮英河堵起来，用竹筒制成大型人力喷水筒，使高山上四十多亩旱田，也全部插上秧苗。
    广西今春雨水少，全区已呈旱象。部分县干旱较重，山塘水库无水，水田有三分之一到一半缺水插秧。各族人民在“天不下雨不靠天，塘水车干车河水，苦战十天又十夜，坚决要把秧插下”的口号下抗旱插秧。
