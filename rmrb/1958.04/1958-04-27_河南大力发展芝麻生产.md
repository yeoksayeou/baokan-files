Henan Province is taking concrete measures to vigorously develop sesame production. This year's planned total output will reach more than 500 million jin, with a yield of more than 100 jin per mu.

Sesame is one of the main oil crops in Henan Province, with a general oil yield of more than 50%. Most of the sesame produced in Henan is summer sesame grown after wheat and peas, with very little spring sesame. It is usually sown after the wheat and peas are harvested in late May to early June. At present, major sesame-producing areas in Henan Province have begun preparations for sesame production. Nanyang Prefecture and other major producing areas have held oil crop work conferences. The prefecture and county made plans for developing sesame production at the meeting, and counties, townships, and cooperatives generally formulated advanced measures to realize the plan based on the plan. At present, these areas are also holding professional meetings from top to bottom to overcome the cadres' idea of ​​underestimating oil crop planting, and summarizing and promoting the advanced experience of sesame production, and universally promoting the "four specials" of professional meetings, specialized technology, specialized teams, and dedicated personnel to strengthen leadership. Now 108 counties in the province have established oil offices, and Deng County, Xinye, and other counties with a large proportion of sesame production have dedicated personnel to manage sesame production. In terms of production management, the producing areas will generally promote the application of more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, increase close planting, early sowing in strips, and do a good job of weeding three times diligently to prevent grass and insect pests after rain. Many counties have already started transporting sesame production fertilizers to the fields. Various producing areas also pay attention to promoting excellent sesame varieties such as "Xiaozihuang" and "Daqingjie," which have dense capsules, mature early, and have high oil yield, and strive for large-scale sesame production increase.

    河南大力发展芝麻生产
    本报讯　河南省正采取具体措施，大力发展芝麻生产。今年计划总产量达到五亿多斤，亩产一百斤以上。
    芝麻是河南省主要油料作物之一，一般出油率在50％以上。河南所产芝麻，春芝麻很少，90％以上都是大麦豌豆茬的夏芝麻，大约在5月下旬到6月初大麦豌豆收获后就要播种。现在河南省各主要产区已开始进行芝麻生产的准备工作，南阳专区等主要产区已召开了油料工作会议，专区和县在会上做出了发展芝麻生产的规划，各县、乡、社根据规划都普遍订出了实现规划的先进措施。目前这些地区还从上到下召开专业会议，克服干部的轻视油料种植的思想，并总结推广芝麻生产的先进经验，普遍推行专业会议、专门技术、专业队、专人负责等四专，加强领导。现在全省已经有一百零八个县成立了油料办公室，邓县、新野等芝麻生产比重大的县都有了专人管理芝麻生产。在生产管理上，各产区将普遍推行每亩增施肥料万斤以上，增加密植，早播条播，并做好勤锄三遍草，防止雨后草荒发生虫害等措施。现在很多县已经开始将芝麻生产的肥料运到田旁，各个产区还注意推广蒴稠密，成熟早，出油高的小籽黄、大青节等优良芝麻品种，争取芝麻大面积增产。
