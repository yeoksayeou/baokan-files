Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch. Many senior medical personnel in Beijing hospitals are conducting a conscious ideological revolution in the Two-Anti Campaign, fiercely attacking bourgeois individualism.

Many senior medical personnel have further understood the principle of "If the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?" Dai Shiming, vice president of Tongren Hospital, said: "The economic foundation of our entire society is already socialist, but our thinking is still capitalist. How can this work? It is not acceptable if we don't consciously carry out ideological revolution." Weng Xinzhi, deputy director of the Department of Internal Medicine at the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Hospital, wrote more than a hundred big-character posters, setting fire to himself and criticizing others. Wu Ruiping, vice president of Beijing Children's Hospital, and Zhu Futang, the president, have worked together for twenty-five years and understand each other very well, but they have almost never formally offered opinions. This time, both sides broke the twenty-five-year "convention" and launched mutual criticisms. Zhu Futang recently also examined himself at a meeting of all department directors of the hospital for having neglected politics in the past, which fostered the tendency of some doctors to be "expert but not Red". Wang Guozheng, director of the Department of Internal Medicine at Jishuitan Hospital, who had always thought that "doctors don't need much Marxism-Leninism," has now begun to realize that he was wrong. He continuously wrote six big-character posters of "self-revelation", more boldly exposing his bourgeois individualism and conservative thinking, and expressed that he would "burn away the five airs, burn thoroughly, burn red," and be determined to put down the director's airs and resolutely transform himself.

Many specific examples listed in the big-character posters of various hospitals exposed and criticized the pursuit of fame and profit by senior medical personnel in scientific research and medical work, pointing out that this thinking has become an obstacle to the advancement of hospital work. A department director of the Third Hospital of Beijing, in order to complete a thesis, did not first try to rescue a patient who was in shock due to excessive blood loss, but insisted on drawing blood for testing. Many big-character posters in Tongren Hospital systematically analyzed and criticized a surgeon's serious irresponsibility and bourgeois thinking towards patients. The big-character posters also revealed the egregious behavior of individual senior medical personnel who, in order to compete for fame and profit, did not hesitate to plagiarize the labor results of others.

### 北京许多高级医务人员  猛攻资产阶级思想

    北京许多高级医务人员
    猛攻资产阶级思想
    新华社1日讯　北京各医院的许多高级医务人员在双反运动中进行自觉的思想革命，猛攻资产阶级个人主义思想。
    许多高级医务人员对“皮之不存，毛将焉附”的道理，有了进一步的体会。同仁医院副院长戴士铭说：“我们整个社会的经济基础已经是社会主义的了，可是我们的思想还是资本主义的，这怎么行呢？我们不自觉地进行思想革命是不行的。”北京中苏友谊医院内科副主任翁心植写了一百多张大字报，引火烧自己也批评别人。北京儿童医院副院长吴瑞萍和院长诸福棠，共事二十五年，互相了解得很清楚，但是他们几乎从来没有正式提过意见。这次，双方都打破了二十五年的“常规”，互相展开了批评。诸福棠最近还在全院科主任会上，检查了他自己过去由于忽视政治助长了有的医生“只专不红”的倾向。一直以为“大夫用不了多少马列主义”的积水潭医院内科主任汪国铮，这次开始认识到自己错了，连续写出“自我揭盖”的大字报六张，比较大胆地揭发了自己的资产阶级个人主义思想和保守思想，表示要“烧掉五气，烧透、烧红”，一定要放下主任架子，痛下决心改造自己。
    各医院大字报列举的许多具体事例，揭发和批判了高级医务人员在科学研究和医疗工作中的名利思想，指出这个思想已经成为医院工作前进中的障碍。北京市第三医院的一位科主任，为了完成一篇论文的需要，对失血过多已经休克的病人不是首先设法抢救，反而强要抽血化验。同仁医院的许多张大字报，系统地分析和批评了一位外科主治大夫对病人严重不负责任的资产阶级思想。大字报还揭露了个别高级医务人员为了争名夺利，不惜剽窃别人劳动成果的恶劣行为。
