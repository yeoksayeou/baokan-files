The Situation Leaps Forward, Leadership Methods Leap Forward
    — On the Leadership Methods of Township Party Committees
    *Xinhua Daily* Editorial, Nanjing, April 9 (Summary)

Since the rectification movement and the winter-spring great production campaign, the enthusiasm of the township Party committees has been stirred up, and their leadership methods are also leaping forward. Although the physical hard work of people has certain limits, the potential of leadership methods is infinite. The instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on working methods have inspired the infinite power in this area. Ideas have been opened up, and lively leadership methods are blooming everywhere like flowers.

Based on the practical experience of various places, the effective leadership methods of the township Party committees can be initially summarized into the following ten points:

I. Give prominence to politics, carry out airing of views and debates. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, people's thinking often lags far behind reality. In ordinary times, new problems, new contradictions, and new difficulties are constantly emerging. In order to keep people's thinking in line with the situation and to continuously solve and overcome new problems, new contradictions, and new difficulties, do not forget to grasp political work. The two roads, the three isms, and the five airs; leap forward versus conservatism; poor production versus rich production; plans versus measures; new problems versus new difficulties – all must be resolved through launching airing of views and debates. In the process of debate, both the original methods of accounting, comparison, recollection, etc., can be adopted, as well as newly created methods such as visits, exhibitions, offering suggestions, posting big-character posters, setting up advanced models, and cadres taking the lead in demonstrations. In addition, methods of challenge and response, both internal and external, can also be used.

II. Take the lead in labor, cultivate experimental fields. "There are thousands of things to lead production, but cadres taking the lead is the most important." First of all, cadres must take the lead in production. In the winter-spring production campaign, many township cadres achieved this and played a great role. Secondly, cadres must take the lead in cultivating experimental fields and high-yield fields. The Chengdong Township Party Committee in Jurong County had thirteen cadres cultivate experimental fields and formulated plans that were both red and expert. Now, 80% of the township cadres have achieved "nine competencies" and "four abilities." The nine competencies are: being able to select seeds, install agricultural tools, cultivate fields, make seedbeds, transplant seedlings, apply fertilizer, weed, control pests, and raise draft animals. The four abilities are: being able to labor, work, summarize, and write situation reports and news reports. Many people have realized that the benefits of taking the lead in labor and cultivating experimental fields are: "Cadres go into the sea, the depth is known"; "Cadres go into the sea, they can encourage the masses to capture the dragon"; "Cadres go into the sea, they can also solve difficult problems, break through at one point, set an example, and promote the overall situation."

III. Assign work directly to the end, inspect work directly to the end. Except for certain major political tasks and difficult work that are resolved through meetings from within the Party to outside the Party, the method of assigning work directly to the end can be adopted. The township Party committee can hold a meeting with cadres above the team leader level and Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists to assign work, or the standing committee members can assign work in separate areas. After the Hengjian Township Party Committee in Liyang County responded to the proposal of "triple-cropping of wheat following rice and doubling rice production" made by twenty-three townships in Changshu County, it immediately convened a meeting of all township commune and team cadres and activists to respond to the challenge. After the meeting, the masses of the entire township, led by key members, fought continuously for eight days, completing the task of accumulating 1,353 loads of fertilizer per mu half a month ahead of schedule. In addition, the township Party committee can organize inspection teams, adopting the method of assigning specific areas to specific people, to inspect directly to the team, to the field, and to the household, inspecting the work while solving problems.

IV. Break through at multiple points, carry out staged assaults. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the tasks of rural work are very heavy, and many projects need to leap forward. Therefore, the township Party committee must focus on the center, make unified arrangements for various tasks, break through at multiple points, create examples, organize forces, and carry out staged assaults. The Xinglong Township Party Committee in Yangzhou County organized shock brigades and launched twenty-three shock campaigns in five months, promoting the leaping progress of various tasks. They organized these assaults in the following five different situations: when backward units and backward projects are discovered, organize assaults to overcome backwardness; when tasks encounter difficulties, organize assaults to open up roads; when time is tight, organize assaults to catch up with the season; when an important task is starting, organize assaults to gain experience and then transition to normal; when work progress is slow and efficiency is low, organize assaults to complete the task in a timely manner. Organizing shock brigades with the participation of Party members, Communist Youth League members, and various activists is a good way to drive the masses to carry out assaults.

V. Launch socialist emulation. The red, green, and yellow (black) three-flag emulation currently used in various townships is a new development in the form of socialist emulation. This kind of competition has clear and moving distinctions; it can promote the advanced, drive the intermediate, promote the backward, and prevent the advanced from becoming arrogant and the backward from becoming discouraged. Townships and communes that have not carried out this kind of emulation must mobilize cadres to air their views and debate, so that everyone understands the meaning and practice of emulation, and then formulate the content of emulation for a certain stage and conduct regular inspections and evaluations. The Bai Mao Township in Changshu County wrote "Take the lead, create miracles again" on the red flag, "Whip the horse faster, be careful not to fall behind" on the green flag, and "Build up energy, don't be discouraged" on the black flag. These words are all very appropriate and powerful.

VI. Visit the advanced, learn from the advanced, focus on helping the backward. Advanced things are the vanguard in the Great Leap Forward. By visiting advanced things, cadres can increase their confidence, learn methods, and catch up. Therefore, leaders must rely on the advanced, organize visits to the advanced, and learn from the advanced. However, the leadership method of "grasping both ends and driving the middle" must be fully implemented. If only the advanced are grasped and the backward are not grasped, the work cannot achieve complete victory. Some places have adopted the method of "sitting in one place and lighting three fires," which is: sit in the backward unit and not leave until the situation is changed; at the same time, spread model deeds in the backward unit and ignite the fire of overcoming difficulties; visit the advanced and ignite the fire of burning conservative ideas; organize competitions and ignite the fire of backward catching up with the advanced. This method of linking grasping the advanced with grasping the backward is worth promoting.

VII. Inspect and evaluate, mutual inspection and mutual comparison. Within the scope of a township, there are generally two forms of inspection and evaluation, mutual inspection and mutual comparison: one is temporary and sudden inspection and evaluation, and the other is regular inspection and evaluation. The members of the inspection team should include township, commune, and team cadres and representatives of old farmers, technicians, youth, and women, and some of the people participating in each inspection can be rotated. The basic content of inspection and evaluation can be determined according to the different requirements of different periods, determining several inspections and several comparisons. The inspection team can be divided into field groups and threshing ground groups. The field group runs through every field and every embankment, inspecting and appraising them one by one. The threshing ground group walks through every household, inspecting items according to the current tasks. For example, now we must look at seeds, draft cattle, fertilizer, agricultural tools, and pesticides.

Discovering the advanced and driving the majority is the main aspect of inspection work. Shortcomings should also be mentioned when they are discovered, but a kind attitude should be adopted. It is necessary to help analyze the causes of the shortcomings and point out ways to overcome them, so that the inspected feel that the inspection team is not here to find fault, but to help and promote.

VIII. Hold production and construction exhibitions. According to the different agricultural seasons and the requirements of the central work, the method of "do what, run what, exhibit what" can be adopted to hold exhibitions frequently. The characteristics of this exhibition are: adapting to local conditions, using local materials, limited spending, simple form, and easy implementation. The townships in Yixing County have already held fertilizer, feed, and good people and good deeds exhibitions. More than 7,000 people visited the fertilizer exhibition in Hongta Township. After the visit, they overcame the idea that there was no fertilizer to accumulate or that fertilizer accumulation had reached the limit. After holding the fertilizer exhibition, Tangjun Township launched a shock fertilizer accumulation campaign, building 575 manure pools in five days and promoting the method of using earthen kilns to smoke soil. Good people and good deeds exhibitions are most popular among the masses, because the people being praised are from this township, and the things being spread are things that happened in this township.

IX. Organize close cooperation and mutual collaboration among various departments. The Party committees in various townships must take production as the center, and uniformly organize the various departments in the township to closely cooperate and collaborate with each other, in order to achieve the purpose of serving production. When holding important meetings, the Xinglong Township Party Committee in Yangzhou County invites cadres and teachers from supply and marketing cooperatives, banks, handicraft cooperatives, cultural stations, and other units to participate. After the meeting, each department immediately arranges its work according to the tasks proposed by the Township Party Committee. The Jintong Township Party Committee in Jiangyin County promoted the practice of "taking agriculture as the main focus, combining the four cooperatives (agricultural cooperative, supply and marketing cooperative, credit cooperative, and handicraft cooperative)" in organizing cooperation between agricultural cooperatives and economic departments. After the Township Party Committee puts forward new tasks, the agricultural cooperative puts forward requirements for production materials, pesticides, funds, etc. according to the new plan, and then a meeting of representatives of the four cooperatives is held to formulate a cooperation plan. The supply and marketing cooperative and the handicraft cooperative supply and produce agricultural tools according to the needs of each agricultural cooperative.

X. Study documents and newspapers, use propaganda tools. Township cadres must regularly read documents and newspapers, and make full use of newspapers, blackboards, local broadcasts, clubs, and wired broadcasts to quickly disseminate the Party's policies, domestic and foreign affairs, advanced experiences, and good people and good deeds to the masses. Each member of the Shuanglou Township Party Committee in Hai'an County subscribes to provincial and county newspapers, and every member has a county newspaper. In addition to collective learning during meetings, they also insist on a one-hour morning study system every day.

In the future, in order to adapt to the development of the situation, the Party committees in various townships must not only use the existing good leadership methods, but also creatively develop them. Only in this way can the Township Party Committee lively lead the work of the township, so that the Party's tasks and policies take root among the masses, improve the production of tens of thousands of mu of land in the township, improve the lives of tens of thousands of people in the township, and make socialist construction in the countryside new every day.

    形势跃进　领导方法跃进
    ——论乡党委的领导方法
    南京新华日报4月9日社论（摘要）
    整风运动和冬春大生产运动以来，各乡党委的干劲已经鼓起来了，他们的领导方法也在跃进中。人们体力上的苦干虽然是有一定限度的，但领导方法上的潜力是无穷的。党中央和毛主席关于工作方法的指示，启迪了这一方面的无穷力量，思路打开了，生动活泼的领导方法像鲜花到处绽开。
    根据各地实践的情况，初步归纳起来，乡党委行之有效的领导方法，主要有如下十条：
    一、政治挂帅，鸣放辩论。在大跃进的形势下，人们的思想往往远远落后于实际，在平常时期内，新的问题、新的矛盾和新的困难，也在不断产生；而要使人们的思想跟上形势，使新的问题、新的矛盾和新的困难，不断地被解决和克服，就不要忘记抓政治工作。两条道路、三个主义与五气、跃进与保守、穷生产与富生产、规划与措施、新的问题与新的困难，都要通过发动鸣放辩论去解决。在辩论过程中既可以采取算账、对比、回忆等等原有的方法，也可以采取参观、展览、献计、贴大字报、摆出先进典型、干部带头示范等等新创的方法，还可以运用挑战应战之类的里应外合的办法。
    二、带头劳动，种试验田。“领导生产千万条，干部带头第一条。”首先是干部要带头生产。在冬春生产运动中，不少乡干部做到了这一点，起了很大作用。其次是干部要带头搞试验田、高产田。句容县城东乡党委十三个干部种了试验田，订了又红又专的规划，现在80％的乡干已经做到“九会”“四能”。九会就是会选种、会安装农具、会耕田、会做秧田、会栽秧、会施肥、会锄草、会治虫、会饲养耕畜；四能就是：能劳动、能工作、能总结、能写情况汇报和新闻报道。许多人体会到带头劳动和种试验田的好处是：“干部下海，深浅有底”；“干部下海，就能鼓舞群众去擒龙”；“干部下海，还能解决难题，突破一点，树立样子，推动全盘。”
    三、一竿子到底布置工作，一竿子到底检查工作。除了某些重大的政治任务和困难的工作，通过党内到党外开会解决外，可以采取一竿子到底的办法布置工作。由乡党委集中队长以上干部和党团员、积极分子一起开会布置工作，或者由常委分片开会布置工作。溧阳县横涧乡党委在常熟县二十三个乡提出“三麦赶水稻、水稻翻一番”的倡议后，立即召开全乡社、队干部和积极分子大会应战。会后，全乡群众在骨干分子的带动下，连续战斗八天，提前半个月完成每亩积肥一千三百五十三担的任务。此外，乡党委可以组织检查队，采取分片包干的办法，一竿子查到队、查到田、查到户，边检查工作，边解决问题。
    四、多点突破、分段突击。在大跃进的形势下，农村工作的任务十分繁重，很多项目需要跃进，因此，乡党委要围绕中心、统一安排各项工作，多点突破，作出样子，组织力量，分段突击。扬中县兴隆乡党委在五个月内，组织突击队，发动了二十三次突击运动，推动了各项工作飞跃前进。他们是在以下五种不同情况下组织突击的：当发现落后单位和落后项目时，组织突击，以克服落后；当任务发生困难时，组织突击，以打开道路；当时间紧迫时，组织突击，以赶上季节；当一项重要任务开头时，组织突击，以取得经验，而后转入正常；当工作进度迟缓、工效不高时，组织突击，以及时完成任务。组织有党团员和各种积极分子参加的突击队，是带动群众进行突击的一种好方法。
    五、开展社会主义竞赛。现在各乡所运用的红、绿、黄（黑）三旗竞赛，是社会主义竞赛形式的新发展。这种竞赛，分野明显动人；能够发扬先进，带动中间，推动落后，防止先进者骄傲和落后者泄气。凡是没有开展过这种竞赛的乡社，必须发动干部鸣放和辩论，使大家懂得竞赛的意义和做法，而后制订一定阶段的竞赛内容，定期进行检查、评比。常熟县白茆乡在红旗上写“一马当先、再创奇迹”，绿旗上写“快马加鞭、当心掉队”，黑旗上写“鼓足干劲、不要泄气”，这些话都说得很恰当、很有力。
    六、参观先进，学习先进，重点帮助落后。先进事物是大跃进中的先头部队。通过参观先进事物，就可以使干部提高信心，学到办法，赶上前去。所以，领导要靠先进吃饭，组织参观先进，学习先进。但是，对于“抓住两头、带动中间”的领导方法，必须全面贯彻，如果只抓先进，不抓落后，工作就不可能获得全胜。有的地方采取了“一坐三点火”的办法，这就是：坐镇落后单位，不改变面貌不走；同时，在落后单位传播模范事迹，点起克服困难之火；参观先进，点起烧毁保守思想之火；组织竞赛，点起落后赶先进之火。这种把抓先进和抓落后联系起来的办法，是值得推广的。
    七、检查评比，互查互比。在一个乡的范围内检查评比，互查互比，一般有两种形式，一种是临时的、突击性的检查评比，一种是经常性的检查评比。检查队的成员，应该包括乡社队干部和老农、技术人员、青年、妇女的代表人物，每次参加检查的人可以轮换一部分。检查评比的基本内容，可以根据不同时期的不同要求，确定几查几比。检查队可以分成田头组和场头组，田头组跑遍每一块田头，每一条圩岸，逐块检查，逐块鉴定；场头组走遍家家户户，根据当前任务分项检查，例如现在就要看种子、看耕牛、看肥料、看农具、看农药等等。
    发现先进，带动多数，是检查工作的主要一面。发现了缺点也要讲，但要采取善意的态度。要帮助分析产生缺点的原因，指出克服缺点的办法，使被检查者感觉到检查团不是来找岔子的，而是来帮助的，来促进的。
    八、举办生产建设展览会。可以根据不同的农事季节和中心工作的要求，采取“做什么、办什么、展览什么”的办法，经常办展览会。这种展览会的特点是：因地制宜，就地取材，花钱有限，形式简明，轻而易举。宜兴县各乡已经办过了肥料、饲料和好人好事展览会。红塔乡的肥料展览会有七千多人参观。参观后，克服了无肥可积、积肥到顶的思想。唐俊乡在举办肥料展览会后，掀起了突击积肥运动，五天就造了五百七十五个粪池，推广了土窑熏土法。好人好事展览会，最受群众欢迎。因为被表扬的人是本乡的人，被传播的事是本乡的事。
    九、组织各部门密切配合，互相协作。各地乡党委必须以生产为中心，统一组织乡内各部门密切配合，互相协作，达到为生产服务的目的。扬中县兴隆乡党委在召开重要会议时，都吸收供销社、银行、手工业社、文化站等单位的干部和教师参加，会后各部门立即根据乡党委提出的任务，分行分业安排自己的工作。江阴县金童乡党委在组织农业社与经济部门协作方面，推行了“以农业为主、四社（农业社、供销社、信用社、手工业社）结合”的做法，每次乡党委提出新任务以后，农业社根据新的规划提出生产资料、农药、资金等方面的要求，然后召开四社代表会议，制订协作计划，供销社和手工业社根据各农业社的需要，进行农具供应和生产。
    十、学习文件报刊，运用宣传工具。乡干部必须经常阅读文件报刊，充分运用报纸、黑板报、土广播、俱乐部、有线广播，把党的方针、政策、国内外大事、先进经验、好人好事迅速地传播到群众中去。海安县双楼乡党委每个常委都订省报和县报，每个委员都有县报，除了开会时集体学习外，每天还坚持早晨一小时的学习制度。
    今后，为了适应形势的发展，各地乡党委不仅要运用现有的好的领导方法，而且要创造性地加以发展。只有这样，乡党委才能生动活泼地领导乡的工作，使党的任务和政策在群众中扎根，把全乡几万亩土地的生产搞好，把全乡几万人口的生活搞好，使农村社会主义建设日日新又日新。
