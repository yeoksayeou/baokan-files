The *Hebei Daily* reports: In water conservancy construction, many people in Hebei Province are worried about how to achieve water conservancy in high and arid mountainous areas. Mabu Township in She County has built water cellar clusters, pointing out a direction for these areas to achieve water conservancy.

Now, this township has built 2,534 water cellars, capable of holding more than 51,000 cubic meters of water, which can solve the problem of drought-resistant sowing for half of the township's land. Coupled with other water conservancy projects, on the township's 17 square kilometers of land, a daily rainfall of 100 millimeters can basically achieve "floodwater not leaving the mountain."

Mabu Township is located at the foot of Fushan Mountain in She County, with three large mountains and two large gullies within its borders; there is no water in the gullies, no springs on the mountains, and the groundwater level is very deep. The five villages in the township, except for Beiluan Shiyan Village, which has slightly better drinking water conditions, either have no drinking water wells or the wells are 15 or 16 *zhang* deep, with very shallow aquifers. For water, people here have fought and died; for water, people have sought "gods," invited "immortals," and carried the "Dragon King," but heaven has not given them any "grace."

After liberation, the Party and the People's Government helped them build four pools and dig 140 water cellars. The farmers in this township had water to drink, but still no one dared to think about using water to irrigate the land.

In mid-December of last year, Hao Jinbao, the secretary of the district party committee, came to Mabu Township with a water conservancy technician. Li Changxing, the township head, and Shen Yuhe and Zhao Micheng, the directors of Mabu Village Cooperative, went to the fields with them to inspect and saw several people digging water cellars, with a patch of black, oily wheat fields beside the cellars. They asked: How deep are they? The answer: 1.8 *zhang*. They asked: How wide are they? The answer: More than eight *chi*. The technician calculated that they could store 17 cubic meters of water, totaling more than 510 *dan*. They asked: How many *dan* of water are needed to sow one *mu* of land? People pointed to the wheat field and said: "This was sown with water from the water cellars, using 100 *dan* per *mu*; to plant corn, only 70 or 80 *dan* per *mu* is enough." That is to say, the water in one water cellar can at least solve the sowing problem for four or five *mu* of dry land. If more are dug, wouldn't this be able to achieve water conservancy? Everyone immediately felt like they had found a treasure, and a series of beautiful ideas emerged. One said: We have the technology and the habit to do this, which can solve the problem of water use, prevent flooding, and conserve soil and water, so that floodwater does not leave the mountain. Another said: Water cellars have less evaporation and seepage, and they are close to the ground, making irrigation convenient.

Following this, a mass campaign to dig water cellars was launched throughout the township.

In the process of digging water cellars, the creativity of the masses emerged one after another. At the beginning, some water cellars encountered large stones before they could be dug deep. In order to save labor, the cooperative members dug a horizontal cave at the bottom, turning it into a "flat cave water cellar," which stored more water. With this creation, the cooperative members were inspired to dig through several water cellars, turning them into "interconnected water cellars," which could be used to irrigate the land with waterwheels. Subsequently, "grape water cellars" and "boiler-style water cellars" were also created.

### 高旱山区蓄水不用再发愁  马布乡水窖群提供好榜样

    高旱山区蓄水不用再发愁
    马布乡水窖群提供好榜样
    本报讯　河北日报报道：在水利建设中，河北省许多人为高旱山区如何实现水利化发愁。涉县马布乡修建水窖群，给这些地区指出了实现水利化的方向。
    现在，这个乡已打成了二千五百三十四个水窖，可容五万一千多方的水，可解决全乡一半土地的抗旱播种用水问题。加上其他的水利工程，全乡十七平方公里的土地上，日降一百公厘的雨，可以基本作到“洪水不下山”。
    马布乡在涉县的符山脚下，境内有三座大山，两条大沟；沟里没水，山上没泉，地下水位又很深。全乡五个村，除北乱石岩村的吃水条件稍微好些以外，其他村不是没有一眼吃水井，就是井深十五、六丈，水母很浅。为了水，这里的人们曾打过架，死过人；为了水，人们求过“神”，请过“仙”，抬过“龙王爷”，但老天并没有给他们一点“恩典”。
    解放后，党和人民政府帮助他们修建了四座水池，打了一百四十眼水窖，这乡农民有水吃了，但是，仍然没有人敢想用水浇地。
    去年12月中旬，区委书记郝金保带着一位水利技术员到马布乡来了，乡长李长兴和马布村社主任申玉河、赵米成等同他们一块到地里去检查，看到有几个人正打水窖，窖边还有一块黑油油的麦田。他们问：打多深？答：一丈八。问：多宽？答：八尺多。技术员计算了一下，可以蓄水十七公方，共合五百一十多担。问：多少担水可点种一亩地？人们指着那块麦田说：“这是用水窖的水点种的，一亩用了一百担；要种玉米，每亩七、八十担就行了。”这就是说，一个水窖的水至少可以解决四、五亩旱地的播种问题。要是打的多了，这不一样能实现水利化吗？大家顿时像得了宝贝一样，一连串的美好想像都涌现出来。这个说：干这个咱们有技术，有习惯，能解决用水，还能防涝、保持水土，使洪水不下山。那个说：打水窖蒸发和渗透的少，又离地近，浇地也方便。
    跟着全乡就开展了群众性的打水窖运动。
    打水窖过程中，群众的创造层出不穷，开始时有的水窖打不深就遇上了大石头，社员们为了节省劳力，就在底部挖一个平洞，变成“平窑水窖”，多盛了水。有了这个创造，又启发社员把几个水窖打通，变成了“连环水窖”，可以用水车浇地。接着，还创造了“葡萄水窖”和“锅炉式水窖”等。
