Kunming, April 21 (By Our Correspondent) - Yunnan Province's more than 14.7 million mu of spring harvest crops are about to reap a comprehensive bumper harvest. Preliminary estimates indicate an increase of more than 20% compared to last year, including over 2.7 million mu of rapeseed, which is expected to increase by about 30% compared to last year.

This year, Yunnan Province's spring harvest crops such as rapeseed, wheat, and broad beans are growing particularly well, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest everywhere. In the warmer areas of southern and central Yunnan, as well as the river valleys of the Jinsha River and Nanpan River, members of agricultural cooperatives are busy harvesting rapeseed, broad beans, and wheat; in northern Yunnan and colder mountainous areas, the rapeseed flowers of agricultural cooperatives are blooming gold everywhere, and spring wheat is flowering and heading. In the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the 320,000 mu of rapeseed planted have an average yield of more than 40 jin per mu, with some reaching as high as more than 200 jin, and it is expected that this year will increase by 194% compared to last year. The rapeseed in Qujing Prefecture is also growing better than in previous years, and the 747,000 mu of rapeseed is expected to increase by 30% compared to last year.

    云南小春作物将获大丰收
    本报昆明21日电　云南省一千四百七十多万亩小春作物，即将获得全面大丰收。初步估算可比去年增产二成以上，其中二百七十多万亩油菜，可比去年增产三成左右。
    今年，云南省的油菜、小麦、蚕豆等小春作物，生长特别好，到处都呈现出一片大丰收的景象。在气候较暖的滇南、滇中地区及金沙江、南盘江等河谷地带，农业社的社员们正在忙于收割油菜、蚕豆和小麦；在滇北及较寒的山区，农业社的油菜花遍地金黄，春小麦正在扬花出穗。在文山僮族苗族自治州种植的三十二万亩油菜，每亩平均产量四十多斤，有的高达二百多斤，预计今年将比去年增产194％。曲靖专区的油菜也比往年长得好，七十四万七千多亩油菜，将比去年增产三成。
