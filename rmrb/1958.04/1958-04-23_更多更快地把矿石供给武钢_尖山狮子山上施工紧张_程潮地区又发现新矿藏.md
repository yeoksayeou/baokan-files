To Supply More and Faster Ore to Wuhan Steel
Construction is Tense on Jianshan and Shizi Mountains; New Mineral Deposits Discovered in the Chengchao Area

    (Our Wuhan Dispatch, 22nd) In order to adapt to the accelerated construction progress of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, the construction project of Daye Iron Mine is currently experiencing its most intense period.
    The mining areas, including Jianshan and Shizi Mountains, have entered the final stage of the entire construction, and the days of formal mining are getting closer and closer. This open-pit mine began stripping operations in August 1955. For more than two years, the mine builders have been operating powerful mining and transportation machinery, and have stripped five million cubic meters of rock from the tops of the two mountains that were pressing on the ore. Now, the huge brown ore body on Jianshan has been exposed, and the ore body on Shizi Mountain, which was buried deeper, has also shown its head in early April.
    Two mountain railways, each fifty kilometers long, have been basically completed. Two months ago, an electric locomotive first drove up Shizi Mountain along the first winding railway. Currently, the second railway and power lines leading to the top of Jianshan have also been basically erected.
    At the foot of Shizi Mountain and Jianshan, where it is said that Tieguai Li (Iron-Crutch Li) practiced making his iron crutch, a large-scale concentrator is being built. Braving the continuous spring rain, the builders are pouring concrete in three shifts day and night, determined to complete the crushing ore system project in the third quarter of this year to produce ore for Wuhan Steel's No. 1 blast furnace.

    Further dispatch: The 805 Exploration Team of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has found another iron ore base for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex in the Chengchao area on the south bank of the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei.
    The 805 Exploration Team entered this mining area for exploration in the spring of 1956, and has now basically explored the resource situation in the eastern half of the mining area. The exploration data obtained so far show that the ore body extends for more than 1,100 meters and is a rich iron ore containing 52% to 56% iron. The ore layer has an average thickness of 50 to 60 meters, and a maximum thickness of 110 meters. The reserves in the eastern half of the mining area alone are enough to build a mine with a production scale equivalent to half of the Daye Iron Mine. They are currently stepping up drilling in the western half of the mining area, which is also a promising area.
    The Chengchao mining area is very close to the Wuchang-Daye Railway and Liangzi Lake in eastern Hubei, which provides good transportation and water supply conditions for future mining. Relevant departments are currently actively preparing to erect high-voltage power transmission lines to this exploration area to accelerate the work here. (Feng Jian) (Attached picture)

    更多更快地把矿石供给武钢
    尖山狮子山上施工紧张  程潮地区又发现新矿藏
    本报武汉22日讯　适应武汉钢铁联合企业加速建设进度，大冶铁矿建设工程目前正经历着最紧张的日子。
    包括尖山和狮子山的采矿场，已经进入整个建设的最后阶段，正式采矿的日子越来越临近了。这座露天采矿场，从1955年8月开始剥离工程，两年多以来，矿山建设者们操纵着威力巨大的采掘、运输机械，已经从两座山顶剥去了五百万立方公尺压在矿石上的岩石，现在，尖山上褐色的巨大矿体已经袒露出来，埋伏较深的狮子山上的矿体也在4月上旬剥露出了头。
    两条长五十公里的登山铁路，已经基本完成。两个月前，电气机车沿着第一条蜿蜒曲折的铁路，首先开上了狮子山；目前，通向尖山顶的第二条铁路和摩电线路，也已基本上架设完毕。
    在狮子山和尖山脚下，相传是铁拐李修炼铁拐杖的地方，正在建设一座规模巨大的选矿厂。建设者们冒着绵绵春雨，日夜三班浇灌混凝土，他们决心在今年第三季先期完成破碎矿石系统的工程，为武钢一号高炉生产矿石。　（冯健）
    又讯　冶金工业部805勘探队在湖北东部长江南岸的程潮地区，为武汉钢铁联合企业找到了另一个铁矿基地。
    805勘探队从1956年春天进入这个矿区勘探，目前已经基本上探明了矿区东半部的资源情况。已经获得的勘探资料表明，矿体延伸一千数百公尺长，是含铁52％到56％的富铁矿。矿层平均有五、六十公尺厚，最厚处达一百一十公尺。仅东半部矿区的储量，就能建设一个生产规模相当于大冶铁矿一半的矿山。目前他们正加紧在矿区的西半部钻探，那里也是大有希望的地区。
    程潮矿区离武昌—大冶铁路和湖北东部的梁子湖很近，这对将来采矿是良好的交通条件和供水条件。有关部门最近正积极准备向这个勘探区架设高压输电线，以加速这里的工作。（冯健）（附图片）
