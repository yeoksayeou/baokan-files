Recommending the Contemporary Drama "Liu Jiemei"
Li Lun

The contemporary drama "Liu Jiemei," performed in Beijing by the Hubei Provincial Drama Troupe, is a good play worth seeing. The story of Liu Jiemei forgetting his roots and turning back can be said to be well known to every family, but this play can still closely hold the audience's heartstrings. I think this is mainly because the playwright and performers did not simply move real people and events to the stage, but after diligent creative work, truthfully portrayed the contrast between the old and new lives, and meticulously depicted the characters' mental outlook, which produced the artistic power that moves people.

At the opening, what unfolds before the audience is a tragic picture of the hard life of peasants in the old society: Liu Jiemei personally witnessed his grandfather being kicked to death by the landlord in front of the Land Temple, and his mother starved to death by the big tree; but later he still had to work as a long-term laborer for the Yu family for ten years to pay off debts. He suffered endless oppression and torment, and could not pay off the usurious loans that rolled like a donkey. After liberation, this poor peasant who had been a long-term laborer for three generations, begged for rice for three generations, and wore ragged clothes in the old society improved his life, became a cadre, and became a glorious Communist Party member. But it was such a Liu Jiemei who forgot his roots and shockingly uttered the fallacy of "the present is not as good as the past" during the Great Blooming and Contending. Through the depiction of life itself, the play convincingly criticized this forgetful thinking and gave the audience a profound socialist ideological education.

At the same time, through the changes in Liu Jiemei's thinking, the play shows the sharp struggle between the capitalist road of "only caring about personal wealth and not caring about the poverty and death of others" and the socialist road of agricultural cooperation and unified purchase and sales in the countryside. The play also praises the victory of the socialist road. With the patient help and education of the Party and the masses, Liu Jiemei woke up from a nightmare, pulled back from the precipice, and resolved to correct his mistakes.

"Liu Jiemei" is a play that was written and performed during the Great Leap Forward, using the "more, faster, better, and more economical" working method. Although it was written and rehearsed in a rush, it still has a high level. The characters of Liu Jiemei, Liu Langcheng, Team Leader Huang, Yu Zhenren, and Yang Liuyi are all written relatively vividly, and the performances are also good. The scenes of forcing people to death in front of the Land Temple, Liu Jiemei being oppressed by the landlord, Liu Jiemei arresting the landlord, and Liu Jiemei's transformation are all written with sharp conflicts and strong drama.

Of course, this play still has some shortcomings. For example, Liu Jiemei's thinking is not explored deeply enough, and there is a lack of powerful depiction on the key issue of why he did not have the communist struggle goal, but developed the thinking of getting rich, so the context of Liu Jiemei's ideological development is not clear in some places. In the performance, some actors do not look like peasants, giving people a sense of being intellectuals to some extent. But these are easy to improve and do not affect it being a wonderful play.

    推荐时事新戏“刘介梅”
    李纶
    湖北省话剧团来京公演的时事新戏“刘介梅”，是一出值得大家去看的好戏。刘介梅忘本回头的故事，可以说是家喻户晓的了，但这戏却依然能紧紧扣住观众的心弦，我想这主要由于剧作者和演出者并不是简单地把真人真事搬上舞台，而是经过辛勤地创作劳动，真实地表现了新旧生活的对比，细致地描绘了人物的精神面貌，这才产生了使人感动的艺术力量。
    开幕时，在观众面前展开的是一幅旧社会农民生活困苦的悲惨图画：刘介梅亲眼看到他的祖父被地主踢死在土地庙前，他的母亲饿死在大树边；但他后来还不能不在俞家当十年长工还债。受不尽的欺压和折磨，还不尽的驴打滚的高利贷。解放后，这个三代当长工、三代讨米、在旧社会穿着破烂衣服的穷苦农民提高了生活，当了干部，并且成为光荣的共产党员。但就是这样一个刘介梅却忘了本，在大鸣大放中令人震惊地说出了“今不如昔”的谬论。剧本通过对生活本身的描绘，令人信服地批判了这种忘本思想，给观众以深刻的社会主义思想教育。
    剧本同时通过刘介梅的思想的变化，表现了农村中“只管个人发家致富，那管别人穷困死活”的资本主义道路和农业合作化、统购统销的社会主义道路之间的尖锐斗争。剧本也歌颂了社会主义道路的胜利。在党和群众的耐心帮助和教育下，刘介梅从噩梦中惊醒过来，悬崖勒马，决心改正过错。
    “刘介梅”是在大跃进中，用“多、快、好、省”的工作方法编演出来的一出戏。虽然是突击写成和排演出来的，但是仍有较高的水平，刘介梅、刘朗成、黄组长、俞振仁、杨六仪等人物都写得比较生动，演的也不错。土地庙前逼死人、刘介梅受地主欺压、刘介梅捉地主、刘介梅转变等场矛盾冲突都写得尖锐，戏剧性很强。
    当然，这出戏也还是有些缺点的。比如刘介梅的思想还挖掘得不够深，在他为什么没有共产主义的奋斗目标，而发展了发家致富思想这一关键问题上缺乏有力的描写，因而刘介梅思想发展的脉络有些地方看不清楚。在演出上，有的演员还不大像农民，令人多少有知识分子之感。但这些是容易改进的，并不影响它是一出精彩的好戏。
