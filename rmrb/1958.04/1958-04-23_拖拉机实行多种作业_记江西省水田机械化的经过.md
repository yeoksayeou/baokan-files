Tractor Implements Multiple Operations
——A Record of Agricultural Mechanization in Jiangxi Province
By our reporter Li Lianbin

Jiangxi Province's comprehensive Great Leap Forward is like a stampede of ten thousand horses. In this charming early spring, everyone is singing about the Great Leap Forward. In the singing, we hear that singing about tractors is one of the strongest notes.

Many agricultural cooperatives are asking to buy tractors. Farmers love tractors, and therefore show great respect for tractor drivers. Wherever tractors go, some people slaughter chickens for the tractor drivers, and some people boil eggs, pasting red paper on the eggs to express respect.

Bold Experimentation, Deeply Rooted

It is no accident that tractors have made such a deep impression on Jiangxi farmers.

It was back in the spring of 1956 that Jiangxi Province established tractor stations for the first time. However, at that time, many people doubted that tractors could go into paddy fields. The opinion that "agricultural mechanization cannot be realized in Jiangxi's farmland" once prevailed in some places. However, the relevant Party and government leaders in Jiangxi, according to the spirit of the central instructions, were not shaken by this opinion, and firmly believed that realizing agricultural mechanization was an unwavering direction. They took the attitude of "everything through experimentation" and drove the tractors into the paddy fields.

They started by trying American-made Ford tractors to cultivate paddy fields, but they sank into the mud in a matter of minutes. Those who lacked confidence became even more shaken.

However, the Party and government leaders of Jiangxi Province were not intimidated by the difficulties, and they continued to experiment. They experimented with more than a dozen different types of tractors from around the world, but none of them were ideal for cultivating paddy fields. Does this mean that the experiment failed? No. Although these tractors could not be used in paddy fields, they discovered the unique performance requirements of paddy fields for tractors during the experiments, and found the key to paddy field mechanization. Finally, they creatively modified a 27-horsepower tractor for both paddy and dry land use. At this point, the problem of paddy field mechanization was fundamentally solved. However, some cadres and farmers did not completely trust this type of tractor. They saw that the tractor was pulling a five-bottom plow in the paddy field, running faster than in dry land, but the depth of cultivation was uneven. They mischievously said: "The fields cultivated by tractors can grow trees in high places and raise fish in low places." Some places even refused to have tractors cultivate their fields. But in fact, the poor quality of cultivation was due to the unreasonable configuration of certain parts and the low technical skills of the tractor drivers. These shortcomings were indeed overcome later, and the cultivation was not only fast, but also of good quality. At this time, the masses of farmers changed their tune and sang that tractor cultivation had eight advantages: smooth plowing without ridges, adjustable depth, small corners and level soil, fertilizer and drought resistance, deep and meticulous cultivation, soft soil, consistent depth, and well-mixed soil.

In this way, tractors took root in the rural areas of Jiangxi.

Close Up Shop or Stay Put?

1956 passed quickly. At the end of the year, a summary showed that all eight tractor stations in the province lost money, with a total loss of more than 42,000 yuan. It was really full of difficulties; the masses were satisfied, but it was not beneficial to the state. Thus, two views emerged: one was to close up shop; the other was to stay put. The issue was raised from profit and loss, but the discussion involved many issues. The former pointed out that the time for using tractors in Jiangxi's paddy fields was very short: ten days or so for spring plowing, ten days or so for summer plowing, and twenty to thirty days for winter plowing. In this way, the tractors slept for more than 300 days out of the year's 365 days. Therefore, they believed that tractors were a huge waste and should not be developed; if developed, it would be "small work, small losses; big work, big losses," advocating closing up shop. The latter did not deny that losing money was a fact, but believed that this was a temporary phenomenon. Realizing agricultural mechanization would liberate farmers from heavy physical labor, so they started to write articles from the two aspects of mechanizing the entire agricultural process and multiple operations. In 1957, they did not "close up shop," but "stayed put." The number of tractors increased from 92 standard units in 1956 to 215 standard units, more than doubling. After much exploration and practice, they improved and created small five-bottom plows, double-roller harrows, knife harrows, and other tractor-drawn farm implements, enriching the content of paddy field mechanization and mechanizing the two agricultural processes of field preparation and harrowing.

The most arduous labor in rural areas is transportation, drainage, and drought resistance, especially drought resistance, which is often during the most intense agricultural season. If these types of labor can be replaced by tractors, it is possible to overcome difficulties, overcome disasters, and save a large amount of labor. Soon, the paddy and dry land dual-purpose tractors were converted into all-purpose tractors. Tractors can carry 3.5-ton trailers for transportation, can carry water pumps for drainage and drought resistance, can carry rice mills for rice milling, can generate electricity for lighting...

In this way, tractors do not sleep for 300 days a year, but are working almost every day, day and night; the general attendance rate reaches about 300 days. In this way, not only is there no loss, but there is also a surplus. In 1957, the province's nine tractor stations had a total surplus of more than 50,000 yuan. Originally, the fee charged for tractor cultivation was lower than the cost of human and animal power, generally only 1.6 yuan per mu. However, as a result of multiple operations, 69% of the tractor stations' income came from multiple operations. From the perspective of workload, plowing and harrowing accounted for 25.49%, reclamation accounted for 22.32%, drainage and drought resistance accounted for 20.5%, transportation accounted for 26.19%, and other accounted for 3.4%. From these percentages, how much potential has the tractor exerted!

Tractors engaged in plowing, harrowing, rolling, drainage, drought resistance, transportation, rice milling, etc., have improved production in rural areas, increased income for farmers, and brought a lot of convenience. Therefore, farmers regard tractor cooperatives as giants of gold mining. The head of Fengdong Cooperative in Nanchang County said: "In the past, we clearly saw that it was gold, but we couldn't get it. Now the tractor has dug the gold into our hands."

Bold Leap Forward to Realize Mechanization

This year, Jiangxi's tractor stations plan to develop to seventeen, with the number of tractors increasing to 325 standard units, and will further strive to realize the mechanization of the entire paddy field agricultural process and multiple operations. The Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute has created a rice weeding machine that can weed 25 mu per day. Weeding is the most arduous type of labor, "eyes facing the yellow earth, limbs in the water, back to the sky." The weeder can replace this type of labor. The paddy field harvester has also been initially trial-produced. One harvester can harvest 50 to 70 mu per day. In this way, except for rice transplanting, all other agricultural processes in paddy fields can be fully mechanized. The state-owned Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory is expanding into a tractor factory, and the local state-owned Jiangxi Machinery Factory also plans to start manufacturing tractors this year, creating conditions for Jiangxi Province to realize mechanization.

    拖拉机实行多种作业
    ——记江西省水田机械化的经过
    本报记者　李连斌
    江西省的全面大跃进有如万马奔腾。在这妩媚的初春，人人在歌唱大跃进。在歌声中，我们听到歌唱拖拉机是最强音之一。
    许多农业社都要求买拖拉机。农民爱拖拉机，因而对拖拉机手也表现很大的爱戴。拖拉机所到之处，有的给拖拉机手杀鸡，有的给煮鸡蛋，在鸡蛋上贴上表示敬意的红纸。大胆试验　扎下深根
    拖拉机在江西农民中获得这样深的印象不是偶然的。
    那还是1956年春的事，江西省破天荒建立拖拉机站。但是，当时很多人怀疑拖拉机能下水田。“江西农田不能实现机械化”的舆论曾一度在某些地方占了上风。可是江西有关党政领导根据中央指示的精神，并没有被这种舆论所动摇，坚信实现农业机械化是坚定不移的方向。他们抱着“一切经过试验”的态度，把拖拉机开到水田里去了。
    开始试用美国造的福特牌拖拉机耕水田，但不要几分钟就陷到泥里去了。没有信心的人更加动摇起来。
    然而江西省党政领导没有被困难吓倒，他们继续试验。试验了世界上十几种不同型号的拖拉机，都不是耕水田所理想的拖拉机。这是不是说，试验失败了呢？不是的。这些拖拉机虽不能在水田里使用，但他们在试验中却发现了水田对拖拉机所要求的特有性能，找到了水田机械化的门径，终于创造性地改制成功一种水田旱地两用的二十七马力的拖拉机。至此，水田机械化的问题根本上解决了。但是有些干部和农民还不完全信任这种拖拉机。他们看到拖拉机在水田里拖着五铧犁，比在旱地里跑得还快，但耕得深浅不匀。他们调皮地说：“拖拉机耕的田，高的地方可栽树，低的地方可养鱼。”有的地方甚至拒绝拖拉机耕田。但事实上耕作质量不好是某些机件配置不合理，拖拉机手技术低。这些缺点后来确实克服了，不但耕得快，而且耕得质量好。这时，农民群众就改过口来，歌唱拖拉机耕田有八好：犁平无骨，能深能浅，角小土平，耐肥耐旱，耕深作细，田身绵软，深浅一致，土融泥烂。
    就这样，拖拉机在江西农村中扎下了根。收摊子还是安摊子？
    1956年很快地就过去了。到年终一总结，全省八个拖拉机站，站站赔钱，共亏损四万二千多元。真是困难重重，群众满意了，对国家又不利了。于是出现两种主张：一种收摊子；一种安摊子。问题是从赔赚提起，但讨论起来，就涉及很多问题。前者提出江西水田使用拖拉机的时间很短，春耕十几天，夏耕十几天，冬耕二十天到三十天。这样一年三百六十五天，拖拉机有三百多天睡大觉。所以认为拖拉机是一桩很大的浪费，不应发展；如果发展，也是“小干小赔，大干大赔”，主张收摊子。后者，不否认目前赔钱是事实，但认为这是暂时的现象。实现农业机械化将把农民从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来，于是他们从整个农事过程机械化和多种作业两个方面着手作文章了。1957年没有“收摊子”，而“安摊子”了。拖拉机由1956年九十二个标准台增加到二百一十五个标准台，增加一倍多。经过许多摸索和实践，改进和创制了小五铧犁、双磙扎耙、刀耙等拖拉农具，充实了水田机械化的内容，使扎田、耙田两个农事过程机械化了。
    农村最繁重的劳动是运输、排涝和抗旱，特别是抗旱，往往在农事最紧张的季节。这几种劳动如果能用拖拉机代替，就有可能克服困难，战胜灾害，节省大批劳动力。不久，水田和旱地两用拖拉机改装为万能的拖拉机了。拖拉机能带三吨半重拖车运输，能带水泵排涝、抗旱，能带碎谷机碾米，能发电照明……。
    这样，拖拉机就不是一年三百天睡大觉，而是几乎天天在劳动，并且白天黑夜地干；一般出勤都达到三百天左右。这样，不但不亏损，而且有了盈余。1957年，全省九个拖拉机站共盈余五万多元。本来拖拉机耕田收的费低于人畜力的费用，一般每亩只收一元六角。但是因为多种作业的结果，拖拉机站收入中的69％都是来自多种作业。从工作量上看，耕耙占25.49％，开荒占22.32％，排涝抗旱占20.5％，运输占26.19％，其他占3.4％。从这些百分比看，拖拉机发挥了多大的潜力呀。
    拖拉机从事耕、耙、轧、排涝、抗旱、运输、碾米等，给农村提高了生产，给农民增加了收入，带来不少的便利。所以农民把拖拉机社作是挖金的巨人。南昌县峰东社看长说：“过去明明看到是金子，也拿不到手，现在拖拉机把金子给挖到了手。”大胆跃进实现机械化
    今年江西的拖拉机站计划发展到十七个，拖拉机增加到三百二十五个标准台，并将进一步争取实现整个水田农事过程机械化和多种作业。江西省农业机械研究所创制了一种水稻耘禾器，每天可耘二十五亩。耘禾是最苦的一种劳动，“眼看黄土，四肢进水，背朝天”，耘禾器可以代替这种劳动。水田收割机也初步试制成功，一台收割机每天可收五十到七十亩。这样，水田除了插秧外，其他农事过程就可以全部实现机械化。国营南昌柴油机厂正着手扩建为拖拉机厂，地方国营江西机械厂也计划今年开始制造拖拉机，为江西省实现机械化创造条件。
