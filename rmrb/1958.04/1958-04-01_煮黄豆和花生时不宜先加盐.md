Why?

    It is not easy to boil soybeans and peanuts until soft if salt is added too early. What is the reason for this?

    Soybeans and peanuts swell after being soaked in water for a period of time. This shows that water has penetrated into their interior, and it also proves that there are many water-permeable pores on their surface and inside (of course, these pores are not easily seen with the naked eye). Obviously, the smaller these pores are, the more difficult it is for water to enter and exit.

    When we boil peanuts or soybeans with salt water, the salt water has a tendency to draw water from the beans or peanuts to dilute its own concentration. In this way, as the water inside the beans or peanuts seeps out, they condense. With this condensation, the many small pores on their surface and inside also shrink. Once the pores are small, it is difficult for the boiling water to penetrate into their interior, which makes it difficult to raise their internal temperature (because soybeans and peanuts themselves do not easily conduct heat), and as a result, it is not easy to boil them soft.

    Therefore, the best way to boil beans and peanuts is to soak them in water first, and boil them after they swell, and then add salt after they are boiled soft. Peanuts and soybeans cooked in this way will be soft, fragrant, and save fuel.

### 煮黄豆和花生时不宜先加盐

专栏：为什么？

    煮黄豆和花生时不宜先加盐
    在煮黄豆和花生时，要是盐加得过早，总是不容易煮烂。这是什么道理呢？
    豆和花生在水中泡了一段时间后，就会发胀。这说明有水渗透到它们的内部了，同时也证明在它们的表面和内部是有许多能够透水的细孔，（当然，这些细孔我们用眼睛是不容易看见的）。显然，如果这些孔愈小，水的出入也就愈困难。
    当我们把花生或黄豆和盐水放在一起煮的时候，盐水有力图从豆子或花生中吸出水分来使它自己浓度变稀的倾向。这样，由于豆子或花生中的水分往外渗出，就使得它们凝缩起来了。这一凝缩，它们表面与内部的那许多小孔也缩小。孔子一小，煮豆的沸水很难渗透到它们的内部中去，这样也就使得它们内部的温度不容易升高，（因为黄豆与花生本身也不容易传热），结果也就不容易煮烂。
    因此，煮豆与花生的最好的办法，应该是先把它们在水中泡一泡，等发胀后再用水煮，煮烂后再放盐。这样煮出的花生和黄豆，就会又软、又香，同时又省燃料。
