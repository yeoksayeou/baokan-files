    The First Branch of the East Wind
    Li Jishen
    As the nationwide rectification campaign brought about the era of the Great Leap Forward, the great construction of socialism in our country has created countless brilliant miracles. Taking water conservancy construction alone, the achievements in just four months have surpassed half of the engineering work done in the past four thousand years. This vigorous new atmosphere truly fills people with the joy of "everything is spring." I am also delighted that all fraternal parties and even the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) can muster revolutionary enthusiasm and enthusiastically plunge into the great torrent of rectification, striving for a great leap forward in their own ideological transformation, so as to meet the requirements of the socialist revolution. Therefore, I compose this short poem as praise, hoping to encourage each other.
    Such fine times, boundless scenes, joyfully all plants grow vigorously. Bring into play the spirit of rectification and reform, and inspire the power of all the people. Ride the wind and waves, competing to report glorious achievements; create four months of water conservancy projects, surpassing thousands of years of miracles. Compare enthusiasm, workers and peasants are fierce. Strive for transformation, we are eager. Contribute a piece of loyal sincerity together, and boil with full-hearted enthusiasm. Obey the leadership, and devote ourselves to the cause of serving society. Great Leap Forward, determined, strive for everyone to be red!

    李济深
    当全民整风带来了大跃进的时代，我国社会主义的伟大建设，创造了难以枚举的辉煌奇迹。只就兴修水利来说，短短的四个月成绩，已迈过四千年工程的一半。这种蓬蓬勃勃的新气象，真给人们以“万象皆春”的欢欣鼓舞。且喜各兄弟党派以至民革同志们，也都能鼓足革命干劲，热烈地投入整风巨流中，争取在自我改造上来个思想大跃进，以适应社会主义革命的要求。爰谱小令为颂，冀共策勉。大好时光，无边景象，欣欣万卉齐茁。发挥整改精神，鼓舞全民动力。乘风破浪，竞喜报、辉煌战绩；创四月水利工程，迈过千年奇迹。比干劲、工农激烈。争改造、吾侪迫切。同输一片丹忱，共沸满腔热血。服从领导，为社会、尽忠事业。大跃进、下定决心，争取人人红色！
