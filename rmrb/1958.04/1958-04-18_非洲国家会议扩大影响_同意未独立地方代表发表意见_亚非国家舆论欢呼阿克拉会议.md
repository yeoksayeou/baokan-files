It is reported that in addition to the representatives of Algeria and Cameroon, representatives of the Togolese People's Movement, Somaliland, and Nigeria have also arrived.

The plenary session on the morning of the 16th lasted approximately five hours. A communiqué issued after the meeting stated that the conference discussed the first item on the agenda and exchanged views on general foreign policy. The conference established three committees: political, economic, and cultural, as well as a general affairs committee.

According to a spokesman for the Moroccan delegation, due to the dissolution of the Moroccan government, the head of the delegation, Foreign Minister Belafrej, will soon return home. He will be succeeded by Hamid Bouri, a member of the delegation and Minister of Public Works.

This newspaper's comprehensive report: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Asian and African newspapers welcome and support the convening of the African Independent States Conference.

Cairo newspapers on the 17th published editorials hoping that this conference would achieve new successes in the African people's independence movement against colonialism. "Al-Ahram" said that it hoped that this conference "will strengthen the powerful Asian-African group and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. This spirit has inspired the people of the two continents and given them the determination to live in an environment of freedom and peace." "Al-Akhbar" hoped that the conference "will be a prelude to the establishment of a new order throughout the African continent, that is, to concentrate efforts to liberate itself from the shackles of imperialism." The newspaper added that the new organization to be established by the conference should declare "Africa for Africans" as its motto, because the African people will never allow colonialism to regard the African continent as its last refuge.

The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an article on the 17th, pointing out that the convening of this conference will encourage the struggle of African countries to win and safeguard national independence.

The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published a commentary on the 17th, saying that like the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference, the holding of the African Independent States Conference is a historic event in the growth of Asian and African countries, and it once again shows that the African people have stood up and are resolutely fighting for freedom and happiness.

The commentary expressed its belief that the African people will fight to defeat the US's conspiracies in Africa. The Accra Conference has also aroused enthusiastic responses from Indian and Indonesian newspapers.

"The Hindustan Times" published an editorial on the 17th, saying, "The Accra Conference is a development of the Bandung Conference." "It is the voice of awakened Africa." The newspaper also pointed out that "the urgency of African countries' demands for independence demonstrated in Accra makes the inevitable in history come true, and all African people will surely be able to manage themselves on their own land."

The Indonesian "Dongxing Daily" believes on the 17th that the African Independent States Conference, which inherits the spirit of the Bandung Conference, embodies the determination of all African countries to oppose colonialism and racism. The newspaper said: "Like the Bandung Conference, the African Independent States Conference will affect the balance of world power." "People's Daily" said that this conference will have a profound impact not only in Africa but also in Asia. Every people who loves independence and freedom will welcome the holding of this conference.
