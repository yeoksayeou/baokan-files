Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 29th: As the Japanese House of Representatives declared its dissolution on April 25th, the election struggle, which had in fact been underway for several months, is intensifying. This election reflects the long-term struggle between two paths in Japan since the war: one is the path of demanding that Japan break away from American control and move towards peace, independence, and democracy, a path chosen by an increasing number of Japanese people; the other is the path of continuing to follow the United States and revive the forces of Japanese militarism, a dead end to which the Japanese reactionary forces, represented by Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, are trying their utmost to drag Japan.

The Japanese Communist Party is successively announcing its list of candidates. As early as April 18th, the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal to the people of the whole country, calling on the Japanese people to take action, strive for the victory of the general election, and concentrate their strength to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet. The appeal accused the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party of running counter to the general trend of the world, following the United States' "position of strength" policy, and placing the Japanese state and people in a dangerous situation. The Japanese Communist Party demands a comprehensive change in the current foreign policy, seeking Japan's complete independence, preventing atomic war, and realizing peaceful coexistence among all countries. The Japanese Communist Party demands the implementation of economic policies to improve the living standards of working people and protect small and medium-sized enterprises, and also demands the maintenance and expansion of democratic rights. The appeal advocates that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party join hands to establish a united front including all democratic forces. The appeal also pointed out the necessity of first strengthening the strength of the Japanese Communist Party and its seats in the Diet.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a declaration for the general election struggle on April 26th, stating that it would do its utmost to win the election struggle. This declaration reiterated that the Socialist Party would pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, make Japan a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China. Mosaburo Suzuki, chairman of the Socialist Party, in a campaign speech delivered in Tokyo on April 28th, also emphasized the need to realize Japan's independence and peace. In his speech, he accused the Liberal Democratic Party of pulling Japan backward and pointed out that its subservient foreign policy toward the United States was unworkable.

The Socialist Party has already announced its list of 251 candidates. In the past few general elections, the Socialist Party's seats have increased. In the last House of Representatives of 467 seats, the Socialist Party held 157 seats.

The pre-election situation is considered unfavorable to the Nobusuke Kishi group. The Nobusuke Kishi cabinet's reactionary domestic and foreign policies have run into snags everywhere. It recently openly antagonized the Chinese people and attempted to overturn the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, which was widely condemned. The increasingly serious economic crisis has made the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, which is implementing a tight monetary policy, even more difficult. The Liberal Democratic Party, headed by Nobusuke Kishi, held 290 seats in the last House of Representatives. As of April 27th, it had announced a list of 377 candidates, and Nobusuke Kishi was trying to get 310 people elected. However, a public opinion poll by Kyodo News has shown that support for Nobusuke Kishi and the Liberal Democratic Party has greatly decreased. This situation has even caused concern in the United States.

### 走向和平民主还是复活军国主义  日本展开两条路线的斗争

    走向和平民主还是复活军国主义
    日本展开两条路线的斗争
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：随着日本国会众议院在4月25日宣告解散，实际上早在几个月以前就在进行的大选斗争，正在激烈展开。这次竞选反映着战后长期以来在日本进行着的两条道路的斗争：一条是要求日本摆脱美国控制、走向和平、独立和民主的道路，这是一条为愈来愈多的日本公众所选择的道路；另一条是继续追随美国、复活日本军国主义势力的道路，以日本首相岸信介为代表的日本反动势力正在竭力把日本拖往这条绝路。
    日本共产党正在陆续公布它的候选人名单。早在4月18日，日共中央就向全国人民发出了呼吁书，号召日本人民行动起来，争取大选的胜利，集中力量打倒岸信介内阁。呼吁书指责岸信介内阁和自由民主党与世界大势背道而驰，追随美国的“实力地位”政策，使日本国家和人民处于危险的境地。日共要求全面改变现行的外交政策，谋求日本的完全独立，阻止原子战争，实现各国和平共处。日共要求执行提高劳动人民生活水平、保护中小企业者的经济政策，并且要求维护和扩大民主权利。呼吁书主张共产党和社会党携起手来建立包括所有民主力量的统一战线。呼吁书并且指出首先加强日共力量和它在国会内的议席的必要性。
    日本社会党在4月26日发表了大选斗争宣言，表明它要以全力在竞选斗争中取得胜利。这项宣言再次强调社会党要推行独立和平的外交政策，使日本成为无原子武器地区，恢复日中邦交等。社会党委员长铃木茂三郎4月28日在东京发表的竞选演说，也强调要实现日本的独立与和平。他在演说中指责自由民主党把日本拉向后退，并且指出它的屈从美国的外交政策行不通。
    社会党已经公布了它的二百五十一名候选人的名单。在过去几次的大选中，社会党的议席都有增加。在上届众议院四百六十七席中，社会党占有一百五十七席。
    选前形势被认为对岸信介集团不利。岸信介内阁的反动的内政和外交政策到处碰壁。它最近公然与中国人民为敌，企图推翻第四次中日贸易协定，遭到了普遍的责难。日益严重的经济危机，使执行金融紧缩政策的岸信介内阁更加处境困难。以岸信介为首的自由民主党在上届众议院占有二百九十席，到4月27日为止，它已经公布了三百七十七名候选人的名单，岸信介企图要使三百一十人当选。但是，共同社的民意调查已经表明支持岸信介和自由民主党的人大大减少。这种形势甚至使美国也感到担心。
