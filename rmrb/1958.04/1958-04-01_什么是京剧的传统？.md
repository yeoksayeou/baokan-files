What is the Tradition of Peking Opera?

Zhang Menggeng

Following the performances of "The White Haired Girl" by the Beijing Yanming Peking Opera Troupe and the China Peking Opera Theater, interest among Beijing's Peking Opera enthusiasts has been piqued. This has also sparked some debate about Peking Opera performing modern plays. For example, some have said: "The dialogue does not use rhyming prose, and the acting boldly abandons many performance styles unique to Peking Opera art, such as dance-like gestures and movements. Besides the elimination of water sleeves due to costume limitations, if many things unique to Peking Opera art in terms of gestures and movements are abandoned, such as the dainty steps, rubbing steps, stamping steps, stage walks, and circular movements in footwork, then to the audience, this is just 'spoken drama with singing' and is no longer Peking Opera... Whether this is appropriate and whether it can be accepted by the broad Peking Opera enthusiasts is still worth studying." (Zhao Zongwen, "A Brave Attempt," People's Daily, March 20)

This question is indeed worth studying. What is the tradition of Peking Opera art? Does the absence of dance-like gestures and dainty steps, rubbing steps, etc., in the roles of the play mean that it is "spoken drama with singing" and not Peking Opera? If we follow this logic, traditional Peking Opera pieces like "Hongniang," "He Zhu Mates," "A Bolt of Cloth," "Pounding the Flour Jar," "Lian Sheng Inn," etc., are all "spoken drama with singing" and not Peking Opera. This is because Hongniang doesn't use dainty steps or rubbing steps, but takes large strides; He Zhu in "He Zhu Mates" and Shen Saihua in "A Bolt of Cloth" both speak Beijing dialect without dance-like gestures... Are we to blame them for "relinquishing" too much of the Peking Opera tradition? Those who have seen these plays probably haven't suggested that their presentation methods don't count as Peking Opera tradition. Furthermore, it is said that because costume restrictions eliminate water sleeves and abandoning unique Peking Opera elements like rubbing steps and circular movements means it's not Peking Opera tradition. Then wouldn't Chen Xiuying in the traditional Peking Opera "Iron Bow Marriage," He Yufeng in "Sister Thirteen," Jin Yunu in "Red Phoenix Happiness," and Wang Shuying in "Imperial Stele Pavilion" all be speaking Beijing dialect, wearing short coats without water sleeves? Some of them have singing and dancing, along with unique Peking Opera footwork; some only have dialogue and singing without dancing. Can't these Hua Dan and Wu Dan plays be considered part of the Peking Opera tradition? We should say that these plays' performance conventions are not only part of the Peking Opera tradition, but also a major part of it. If there is no dispute about this, then why is it that when Xi'er and Yang Bailao speak Beijing dialect, wear short costumes without water sleeves, and don't use rubbing steps or circular movements, they are criticized for not being Peking Opera and becoming "spoken drama with singing"? Why are they accused of "abandoning" too much tradition? I think the problem doesn't lie here, nor does it lie in whether Peking Opera enthusiasts can accept it, but rather in the fact that Comrade Zhao Zongwen has habitual views. Perhaps he is used to seeing "Red Phoenix Happiness" and is not yet accustomed to seeing "The White Haired Girl." Habit often makes people see new things as not as good as old things, and it often casts doubt on the growth of new things.

Does this mean that the Yanming Peking Opera Troupe's trial performance is already complete and flawless? No, it's not. But their shortcomings are not that they relinquish and break through tradition too much, but that they inherit too little of the Peking Opera tradition. That is to say, in inheriting and developing Peking Opera's artistic forms to express modern characters, they are still somewhat restrained and not bold enough. I believe that these shortcomings will be resolved in continuous trial performances and will be resolved with the help of Peking Opera enthusiasts and the general public.

    什么是京剧的传统？
    张梦庚
    北京燕鸣京剧团、中国京剧院相继演出“白毛女”后，引起了北京广大京剧爱好者的兴趣，也引起了一些关于京剧演现代戏的争论，如有人讲：“对话不用韵白，演技方面大胆地抛弃了许多京剧艺术特有的表演样式，例如舞蹈化的身段、动作步法等等，在因为服装限制而取消了水袖等等之外，在身段、动作方面再抛弃了许多京剧艺术特有的东西，如步法中的俏步、搓步、蹋步、走边、圆场等等，那么观众看来，这就只不过是‘话剧加唱’而已经不是京剧了，……而这样做是否妥当，是否能为广大的京剧爱好者所接受，还是值得研究的。”（人民日报3月20日赵宗文：“一次勇敢的尝试”）
    这个问题确实值得研究，什么是京剧艺术的传统呢？是不是戏里角色没有了舞蹈化的身段与俏步、搓步等等……就是“话剧加唱”而不是京剧了呢？如果按照这样的说法，京剧里的传统剧目“红娘”、“荷珠配”“一匹布”、“打面缸”、“连升店”等等戏……也都是“话剧加唱”不是京剧了。因为，红娘也不走俏步、搓步，是迈着大步走；“荷珠配”里的荷珠，“一匹布”里的沈赛花也都是说京白没有舞蹈化的身段，……难道也责备他们是“割爱”京剧传统太多了吗？看过这些戏的人，恐怕并没有人提过这些戏的表现方法不算京剧的传统。再就是说，由于服装限制取消了水袖，抛弃了京剧艺术所特有的东西搓步、圆场等就不是京剧的传统。那么京剧传统剧目“铁弓缘”里的陈秀英、“十三妹”里的何玉凤、“红鸾禧”里的金玉奴、“御碑亭”里的王淑英等就都是说京白，穿短裤袄没有水袖；她们有的有唱有舞也有京剧特有的步法；有的只有白有唱无舞，难道这些花旦、武旦戏就不能算京剧的传统了？我们应该说，这些戏的表演程式不但是京剧的传统，而且是京剧传统里的主要部分。如果这样的说法没有争论的话，那么为什么喜儿、杨白劳说京白、穿短服装没有水袖，不走搓步、圆场等就被责备不是京剧而成了“话剧加唱”呢？就被指责“抛弃”传统过多了呢？我看问题不在于此，也不在于京剧爱好者能不能接受，而是赵宗文同志有着习惯性的看法。也许他看“鸿鸾禧”习惯了，第一次看“白毛女”还不习惯。习惯性往往使人看新事不如看旧事好，它往往对新鲜事物的生长发生怀疑。
    是不是说燕鸣京剧团的试演已经完整无缺了呢！也不是的。但他们的缺点不是割爱与突破传统太多了，而是继承京剧传统少了些，也就是说在继承与发扬京剧的艺术形式，表现现代人物时还有些拘谨，不够大胆。我相信这些缺点是会在不断的试演中得到解决的，是会在京剧爱好者及广大群众的帮助下得到解决的。
