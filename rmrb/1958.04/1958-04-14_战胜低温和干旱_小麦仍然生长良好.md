    Overcoming Low Temperatures and Drought
    Wheat Still Growing Well

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th. After being hit by temperatures of minus two degrees Celsius recently, wheat in some areas of northern Jiangsu is turning green again thanks to the vigorous efforts of the masses to rescue it. In the Huaiyin Special Zone, 460,000 people have been involved in a crash program to irrigate and save the wheat. In the Yancheng Special Zone, more than two million mu of wheat fields have been watered once; in Jianhu County of this special zone, 200,000 people were mobilized to water and topdress the frozen wheat with fast-acting fertilizer after the low temperature strike. Thanks to timely rescue efforts and the rapid warming of the weather, the injured wheat seedlings have successively regained their vitality and most have turned green. At present, the growth of more than 55 million mu of wheat in the province is still good.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 13th. After more than half a month of hard work by Sichuan farmers to fight drought and protect seedlings, the more than 20 million mu of wheat and more than 30 million mu of other beans and miscellaneous grain crops in the province are now generally growing well. The agricultural departments believe that the wheat is currently heading and setting seeds, and the beans are flowering and setting pods, so increased production is expected.

    Since mid-March, varying degrees of drought have occurred in various parts of the province, with the drought-affected area of spring crops reaching about 20%, and in some places reaching 40%.

    Thanks to the people's vigorous efforts to fight drought, not only has the growth of the drought-affected Class 3 spring crops improved, but also the general seedlings have become more lush due to irrigation. Recently, continuous spring rains in the province have further promoted the growth of spring crops.

    战胜低温和干旱
    小麦仍然生长良好
    据新华社南京13日电　江苏北部部分地区的麦子最近受到摄氏零下二度的低温袭击后，经过各地群众大力抢救，正在返青。淮阴专区有四十六万人投入灌水抢麦的突击工作。盐城专区有二百多万亩麦田都浇了一次水；这个专区的建湖县，在低温袭击以后，发动二十万人对受冻麦子浇水和追施速效肥料。各地由于抢救及时和天气很快转暖，受伤的麦苗先后恢复生机，大部分转青。目前全省五千五百多万亩麦子生长情况仍然良好。
    据新华社成都13日电　四川省农民经过半个多月来的抗旱保苗苦战，全省两千多万亩小麦和三千多万亩其它豆类、杂粮作物现在普遍生长良好。农业部门认为，目前小麦正在抽穗结籽，豆类开花结荚，增产有望。
    3月中旬以来，全省各地发生程度不同的旱象，小春作物受旱的面积达到20％左右，个别地方达到40％。
    由于人民大力抗旱，不但受旱的三类小春作物生长好转，一般禾苗也由于浇灌而更加茂盛。近日全省春雨连降，又进一步促进了小春作物的生长。
