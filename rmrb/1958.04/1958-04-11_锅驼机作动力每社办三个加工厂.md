Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, April 10th: The An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to utilize the agricultural cooperatives' existing boiler-tractor engines used for irrigation, etc., as power sources to establish more than 500 grain and fodder processing plants and granular fertilizer manufacturing plants, so that one set of power equipment can serve both agricultural and industrial production simultaneously.

By adopting this method, An'guo County can save more than 1 million yuan in industrial construction funds. Using agricultural production power for industry reduces the construction funds for each small-scale grain processing plant significantly, compared to purchasing power machinery at the same time. A fodder processing plant can be built for only over 300 yuan. Adopting this method can also accelerate the pace of processing industries in agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, the county can establish three processing plants—grain, fodder, and fertilizer—in every commune this year.

    锅驼机作动力每社办三个加工厂
    据新华社保定10日电　中共安国县委决定利用农业社现有灌溉用的锅驼机等作动力，建立五百多座粮食饲料加工厂和颗粒肥制造厂，使一套动力设备同时为农业和工业两种生产服务。
    安国县采取这种办法，总共可以节省工业建设资金一百多万元。借用农业生产动力办工业，每座小型粮食加工厂的建厂资金，比同时购买动力机械减少很多，一座饲料加工厂，只有三百多元就可建成。采取这种办法，还可加快农业社加工工业的速度。因此，该县在今年即可社社都办起粮食、饲料、肥料三座加工厂。
