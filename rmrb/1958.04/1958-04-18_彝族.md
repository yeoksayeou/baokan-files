The Yi people are a minority ethnic group in southwestern China, with a total population of approximately 3.2 million. They are mainly distributed in the Daliang Mountains and Xiaoliang Mountains bordering Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, and in most parts of Yunnan Province, followed by some areas of Guizhou Province.

Historically, the names Nanzhao, Wumeng, Wuman, and Luoluo used in China were names for the Yi people between the Han Dynasty and the Tang and Song Dynasties. As early as the mid-8th century AD, the Yi people in Yunnan Province, together with other ethnic groups, jointly established the Nanzhao Kingdom, which was dominated by the Yi people. Archaeological finds in the Yi inhabited areas of central and eastern Yunnan province indicate that the ancestors of the Yi people had already reached a high level of copper casting technology and artistic decoration as early as the Han Dynasty.

Since the 20th century, the Yi people have joined other fraternal ethnic groups in waging staunch resistance against reactionary rulers and foreign invaders more than once. In the spring of 1948, under the leadership of the Party, a guerrilla zone was established in the Guishan area.

The Yi people have their own language. There was originally an old Yi script, but the number of characters was small, there were many variations, and few people knew it. In 1951, an experimental phonetic Yi script was developed. By the end of December 1956, the Liangshan Yi phonetic script scheme (draft) was determined based on this new script. In terms of literature and art, the Yi people have a very rich tradition of oral poetry. The folk dances of the Yi people, such as the Axi and Sani "Dancing under the Moon," are beautiful flowers of China's national dance art.

The Yi people are mainly engaged in agricultural economy, with some also engaged in animal husbandry. In the past, the Yi people in the Liangshan area still retained a slave system, divided into two classes: White Yi and Black Yi. The Black Yi, who accounted for about 5%-6% of the population, were slave owners and ruled over the numerous White Yi. In February 1956, democratic reforms began in this area, and by the end of 1957, the democratic reforms, with the abolition of slavery, the emancipation of slaves, and the distribution of land as the main content, were all victoriously completed, and the slaves were liberated.

Like other fraternal ethnic groups in the country, the Yi people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have achieved ethnic equality. To date, the autonomous areas established by the Yi people or jointly by the Yi people and other ethnic groups include: the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province; the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the Weishan Yi Autonomous County, the Ninglang Yi Autonomous County, the Mile Yi Autonomous County, the Eshan Yi Autonomous County, the Lunan Yi Autonomous County, the Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous County in Yunnan Province; and the Weining Yi, Hui and Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province.

    彝族
    彝族是我国西南地区的一个少数民族，总人口约三百二十万，主要分布在四川省和云南省交界的大小凉山地区和云南省的大部分地区，其次分布在贵州省的部分地区。
    我国历史上所称的南诏、乌蒙、乌蛮、罗罗等名称是汉代到唐、宋之间对彝族的称谓。早在公元八世纪中叶，云南省彝族同其他民族联合建立了以彝族为主的南诏国。不久前在滇中、滇东彝族聚居地区出土文物表明，早在汉代彝族祖先在铜的冶铸技术和艺术装饰上已达到较高的水平。
    二十世纪以来，彝族人民曾和其他兄弟民族人民在一起不止一次地对反动统治者和外国侵略者进行过顽强的反抗。1948年春季，在党的领导下，在圭山区建立游击区。
    彝族有自己的语言。原来有一种老彝文，但字数少，变体多，认识的人很少。1951年曾经制订实验拼音彝文。到1956年12月底，在这种新文字的基础上确定了凉山彝族拼音文字方案（草案）。文学艺术方面，彝族有非常丰富的口传诗歌。彝族的民间舞蹈，阿细、撒尼“跳月”是我国民族舞蹈艺术的美丽花朵。
    彝族以农业经济为主，部分人兼营畜牧业。过去，凉山地区的彝族还存留着奴隶制度，分为白彝和黑彝两个阶级，约占人口5％—6％的黑彝是奴隶主，分别统治着人数众多的白彝。1956年2月，开始在这个地区进行民主改革，到1957年年底，全部胜利地完成了以废除奴隶制度、解放奴隶和分配土地为主要内容的民主改革，奴隶获得了解放。
    跟国内其它兄弟民族一样，彝族在中国共产党领导下，实现了民族平等，到目前为止，已建立的彝族或彝族与其它民族联合的自治地方有：四川省的凉山彝族自治州；云南省的红河哈尼族彝族自治州、楚雄彝族自治州、巍山彝族自治县、宁蒗彝族自治县、弥勒彝族自治县、峨山彝族自治县、路南彝族自治县、江城哈尼族彝族自治县；贵州省的威宁彝族回族苗族自治县等。
