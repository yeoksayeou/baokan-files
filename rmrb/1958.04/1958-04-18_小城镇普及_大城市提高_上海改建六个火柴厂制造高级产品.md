Popularization in Small Towns, Improvement in Big Cities
Shanghai Converts Six Match Factories to Manufacture High-End Products

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the *Liberation Daily*, in order to adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, the Shanghai Municipal Light Industry Bureau has decided to eliminate some industries with excessive production and backward technology, and to develop high-end light industrial products. One of the measures is that from January to the end of June this year, six of the city's existing seven match factories will be successively converted into plastic products factories with modern technology and equipment, sewing machine manufacturing factories with products in short supply, motorized toy factories manufacturing high-end toys, and pencil wood processing factories that are currently needed.

Before liberation, Shanghai's match industry had as many as sixteen or seventeen factories at its peak, and there was blind competition. After liberation, local industries in various places developed vigorously, and the number of matches needed decreased year by year. After the upsurge of joint state-private ownership in the city, after relocation, consolidation and merging, there are still seven match factories. If all the machinery and equipment of these seven factories are fully utilized, they can produce 4 million cases of matches annually. However, in order to balance the production and sales of matches nationwide, the annual output has been compressed to the level of 557,000 cases for many years. The consumption in Shanghai alone is even smaller, only 120,000 cases per year. Therefore, factory buildings, equipment, and labor are greatly wasted. Now, a fully functional automated Huaguang Match Factory is left. As long as it operates two shifts a day, it can reach the annual output level of 557,000 cases of matches; even if the sales volume of matches in Shanghai and nearby areas greatly increases in the future, this match factory still has the potential to increase production by 250,000 cases per year.

The conversion of these six match factories not only solves the long-standing difficult situation of Shanghai's match industry, but also gains the support of all employees in the industry. What is even more gratifying is that this practice of eliminating industries with excessive production and backward technology and developing high-end and urgently needed light industrial products is a new and major measure for Shanghai's light industry to resolve the contradictions with inland local industries, and also a new starting point for Shanghai's light industry to develop towards high-end products and carry out technological transformation.

    小城镇普及　大城市提高
    上海改建六个火柴厂制造高级产品
    本报讯　据解放日报报道：上海市轻工业局为了适应全国工农业生产大跃进的新形势，决定淘汰一部分产量过剩、技术落后的工业，发展高级轻工业产品。措施之一是，自今年元旦至6月底为止，全市现有七个火柴厂中的六个，陆续改建成为具有现代技术设备的塑料制品厂、产品供不应求的缝纫机制造厂、制造高级玩具的机动玩具厂，以及当前需要的铅笔木材处理厂等。
    解放以前，上海火柴工业最多的时候有十六七家工厂，而且盲目竞争。解放以后，各地地方工业蓬勃发展，火柴的需要数量也就逐年减少。全市公私合营高潮后，经过外迁和裁并改合，到目前为止，还有七家火柴厂。这七个厂的机器设备如果全部开足，每年可以生产四百万件火柴，但是为了使全国火柴的产销平衡，历年来一直压缩在五十五万七千件的年产量水平上。而上海一地的消费数量，更是小得每年只有十二万件。因此，大大浪费了厂房、设备和劳动力。现在留下一个全能的自动化的华光火柴厂，每天只要开两班生产，就能达到年产五十五万件火柴的水平；即使将来上海和就近地区的火柴销售量大增，这个火柴厂也还有每年增产二十五万件的潜力。
    这六个火柴厂的改建，不仅解决了上海火柴工业长期以来的困难状况，而且得到全行业职工的拥护和支持，真是皆大欢喜。更加可喜的是：这种淘汰生产过剩和技术落后的工业，发展高级的和急需的轻工业产品的做法，是上海轻工业解决与内地地方工业矛盾的一个新的重大的措施，也是上海轻工业往高级品方向发展、进行技术改造的一个新的起点。
