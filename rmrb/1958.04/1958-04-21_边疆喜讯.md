Good News from the Border Regions

    (Our report) The Yunnan Nationalities Publishing House was recently established in Kunming. This is a joyous event for the people of all ethnic groups in the border regions of the motherland. The publishing house has eight ethnic language reading material compilation and translation groups, with ethnic minority cadres accounting for an average of more than one-half of each group. The Han cadres are all graduates of the Minority Languages Departments of the Central Institute for Nationalities, each mastering one ethnic language and possessing a certain amount of linguistic knowledge, as well as a considerable level of Marxist-Leninist theory. This year, the publishing house will tentatively compile and publish elementary school textbooks and general comprehensive reading materials in the Dai Yong, Dai Le, Lisu, Jingpo, Zaiwa, Kawa, Lahu, and Hani languages.
