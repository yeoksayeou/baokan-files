Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 24th: A meeting of representatives from over one hundred Japanese manufacturers was held in Tokyo today, entitled "Manufacturers' Meeting for Full Implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement." The meeting unanimously adopted a statement demanding that the Japanese government immediately and unconditionally provide full support and assistance to the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and guarantee its implementation.

The statement, issued by the meeting jointly organized by five groups including the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Japan Commodity Exhibition, the Japan-China Trade Promotion Association, the Japan-China Trade Small and Medium Enterprise Association, and the Local Assembly Members' League for Promoting International Trade, expressed strong dissatisfaction and anger at the Japanese government's attitude of obstructing the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

The statement demanded that the Japanese Diet, transcending party lines, pass a resolution requiring the Japanese government to approve the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

The statement called on the three Japanese trade groups that signed the agreement to unite and do everything possible to urge the Japanese government to withdraw its reply to the three groups on April 9, and strive for full government approval for the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

Many manufacturers' representatives spoke at the meeting, strongly criticizing the Japanese government's attitude and demanding that the government immediately and fully agree to the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

The meeting decided to establish the "Manufacturers' Council for Promoting the Implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement," and appealed to people from all walks of life and various groups for assistance in expediting the resolution of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement issue.

The Japan Socialist Party submitted a resolution to the House of Representatives on April 22, requesting the Japanese government to support and assist the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and its memorandum. On the 23rd, Socialist Party member Toshi Nakazaki questioned the government in the House of Representatives, pointing out that the Japanese government should change its diplomatic policy of leaning entirely towards the United States and restore diplomatic relations with China. He also demanded that the Japanese government retract the statement made by Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi that Chinese commercial representative offices would not be allowed to display the Chinese flag.

In his response, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated that his government would not change its attitude of undermining the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.
