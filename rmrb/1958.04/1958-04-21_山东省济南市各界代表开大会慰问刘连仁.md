Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 20th: This afternoon, more than 800 representatives from all walks of life in Shandong Province and Jinan City held a consolation meeting for compatriot Liu Lianren at the auditorium of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference.

Liu Minsheng, Deputy Governor of Shandong Province, Gao Xiangjiu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and representatives from various circles in the province and city, in their speeches, unanimously expressed cordial concern and sympathy to compatriot Liu Lianren, and thanked the Japanese people and friendly organizations for their righteous support for Liu Lianren. They also condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for its hostile attitude towards the Chinese people in the Liu Lianren incident, and firmly supported Liu Lianren's demand for compensation from the Japanese government for all losses.

During the meeting, a working woman, Wang Jingyong, sent in a letter of accusation against the Kishi Nobusuke government. The letter said: "My uncle, Gao Zhaofeng, was from Guandaodian Village, Eleventh District, Zhangqiu County. In July 1944 (lunar calendar), he was captured by the invading Japanese army in Hongshan. He was also shipped from Qingdao to Japanese coal mines to work as a forced laborer. My maternal grandmother was widowed at a young age and only had one son, my uncle. After he was captured, my maternal grandmother was lonely and helpless, suffering hardships. Since hearing the news of Liu Lianren, she has been hoping that my uncle can return to the motherland. She is now sixty years old, and I firmly demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government hand over my uncle and compensate my uncle and maternal grandmother for their losses." The letter of accusation was read out at the meeting.

Liu Lianren spoke three times at the meeting. Shan Yiwen, who was abducted with Liu Lianren fourteen years ago, also spoke at the meeting. Their solemn accusations against the Japanese government aroused indignation from the audience, and everyone pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government must be held responsible for all the Chinese compatriots abducted in the past.

    山东省济南市各界代表开大会慰问刘连仁
    新华社济南20日电　今天下午，山东省和济南市各界代表八百多人在省政协礼堂举行了慰问难胞刘连仁大会。
    山东省副省长刘民生、省政协副秘书长高象九和省、市各界代表，在讲话中一致对难胞刘连仁表示亲切关怀和慰问，并且感谢日本人民和各友好团体对刘连仁的正义支持。他们还斥责岸信介政府在刘连仁事件中所采取的敌视中国人民的态度，坚决支持刘连仁向日本政府提出的赔偿一切损失的要求。
    大会在进行中收到一位劳动妇女王敬勇对岸信介政府的控诉书，控诉书说：“我有个舅父高照丰，是章丘县十一区官道店村人，1944年农历7月在洪山被日本侵略军队掳去，也是从青岛装船运到日本煤矿作苦工的。我外祖母年青守寡，只有舅父一人，他被捉去后外祖母孤老无依，受尽辛苦，自从听到刘连仁的消息以后就天天盼着舅父能回到祖国来。她现在已经六十岁了，我坚决要求岸信介政府把我舅舅交出来，并赔偿我舅舅和外祖母的损失。”大会当场宣读了这份控诉书。
    刘连仁在会上先后讲话三次。十四年前同刘连仁一起被掳走的单亦文也在会上讲了话。他们对日本政府的严正控诉引起全场的激愤，大家纷纷指出岸信介政府一定要对过去掳走的一切中国同胞作出负责的交代。
