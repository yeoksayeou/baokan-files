According to preliminary tests, it performs well in terms of speed and pulling power. It can run a long distance of 100 kilometers in just seven and a half hours.

    优良品种
    三河马
    三河马是我国一个较新的优良地方马种，自开始培育到现在只有几十年历史。这种马产在内蒙古东部呼伦贝尔盟额尔古纳旗的三河地区。它的祖先虽然是后贝加尔马，但是由于在三河生活繁衍了数十年，并和别的马发生血缘关系，所以外型、体质和性能等有了变化，形成了一个独立的类型。
    三河马体高一般在一百四十厘米左右，比通常看到的蒙古马高出十多厘米；它的体重在三百到三百五十公斤之间。
    三河马的优良特性是体质结实，坚忍耐劳，能适应粗放的饲养管理。根据初步测验，它的速度和挽力都有良好表现。一百公里的长途，它只要七个半小时就能跑完。
    山东大黄牛
    山东黄牛是我国优良黄牛品种之一。山东牛分山地牛和平原牛两种体型，平常所说的山东黄牛是指的后一种。
    山东黄牛性情驯良，步伐稳健，有持久力，是好的役用牛。它在役用性能上，挽力大而持久。据群众试验，两头牛挽双轮双铧犁，每天最多可耕作零点八公顷。这种牛在山东北部，每头可负担耕地三公顷左右。在拉车上，它的劲头也是很大的。两头牛挽铁轮木轴车，能曳重一千公斤，每天在土路上走三十五公里。
    山东黄牛的繁殖力很高，一般每年一胎，一生可产犊十几头。（附图片）
