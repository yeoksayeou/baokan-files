    Declaring War on Earth
    Guo Moruo
    *This poem is dedicated to the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, many of whom will be going to various parts of the country to participate in the production work of state-owned farms and ranches, to boost their morale.*
    Outstanding soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, heroes,
    You are the elite of 600 million people!
    Under the leadership of the Party,
    Under the teachings of Chairman Mao,
    You smashed the joint forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism
    Into a flowing stream of fallen flowers.
    You transformed China's world
    Into the world of 600 million people;
    The 600 million people have become masters,
    Who doesn't praise you as the very best!
    You not only have superb martial skills,
    But also a high level of culture,
    In the past eight years, on every front of the motherland's production construction and cultural and educational construction,
    Which great battle didn't you fight?
    One victory following another,
    One revolution following another,
    You truly deserve to be called continuous revolutionaries!
    Now many of you comrades are demobilizing and returning to the countryside,
    No, you are shifting battlefields, declaring war on Earth.
    Chairman Mao said: We must first conquer the Earth's surface,
    And then enter outer space.
    Such a vast and boundless battlefield
    Has already unfolded before our 600 million people.
    Our country has 1.44 billion mu of land,
    But the existing cultivated land accounts for less than 20 percent.
    Our population is large,
    The average distribution, although more than Japan and the United Kingdom,
    Is far less than the United States and the Soviet Union. (Note)
    We must reclaim land on a large scale,
    South to Hainan Island, north to the Heilongjiang border,
    West to the Pamir Plateau, the roof of the world.
    The seabed and mountain tops can be planted,
    The vast Gobi Desert must be transformed into fertile fields.
    The power of 600 million people can move mountains and overturn seas,
    You are outstanding combat personnel.
    You are leading state-owned farms and ranches,
    You must set an example for the nation's cooperatives.
    What's more, our underground also has infinite treasures,
    We must open the underground warehouses to let the treasures see the sky.
    Comrades, the bugle call of the technological revolution has been sounded,
    We must march boldly towards science and technology;
    Steel production must catch up with the United Kingdom in fifteen years,
    Science and technology must catch up with the world level in ten years.
    All of China's working people are exerting their utmost efforts and striving for the upper reaches,
    Agriculture and industry are both experiencing a great leap forward,
    This situation is like liberated atomic energy,
    Chain reactions are occurring everywhere.
    Chairman said: The whole nation is vigorously developing, full of hope,
    We must treat ourselves as ordinary laborers and follow the advancement!
    Yes, no obstacle can stop us,
    No matter how high the mountains, how deep the water,
    How hot the fire, how cold the ice.
    Haven't we already conquered the Yangtze River and the Qinling Mountains?
    Next to the high-temperature steelmaking furnace, the hotter it is, the more invigorated we are;
    Water conservancy projects are also being carried out at minus twenty degrees?
    The Sanmenxia and Three Gorges Dams must be tamed like kittens,
    We must see the vast Yellow Sea turn into a clear blue sky.
    Yes, only in the dictionary of fools,
    Can you find this word – "impossible."
    Today, of course, we are only active domestically,
    But tomorrow, our situation will be very different.
    We will go to the Antarctic ice sheet, and also to the Arctic Circle,
    We will also go to the moon to visit the Guanghan Palace.
    Martyrs Yang Kaihui and Liu Zhixun may still be guests there,
    While Wu Gang and Chang'e are still hosting together.
    Of course, there must be Soviet friends there,
    A Sino-Soviet grand get-together, with red flags turning the universe red.
    Without a doubt, the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind,
    That is to say, even the West Wind has become the East Wind.
    The warm East Wind blows eternally,
    Making the whole world and the whole universe full of verdant spring.
    Races are no longer divided into red, yellow, black, white, and brown,
    All are sisters, all are brothers.
    Of course, even then there will still be contradictions,
    But there will always be ways to reconcile within the people.
    Other planets may also have more advanced humans,
    We must exchange experiences and strive for universal harmony.
    Comrades, is this a fantasy?
    No, this is precisely the pinnacle of Marxism.
    But I don't want to put much effort into praising tomorrow,
    I just want to put more effort into praising you today.
    Hurry up and declare war on Earth, comrades,
    Whether at the ends of the earth, let us charge into battle!
          (March 23, 1958)
  (Note) The Soviet Union has 15 mu per person, the United States 19 mu, the United Kingdom 1.5 mu, Japan 0.9 mu, and China 2.7 mu.

### 向地球开战

    向地球开战
    郭沫若
    中国人民解放军的将士，有不少同志将赴全国各地参加国营农牧场的生产工作，作此诗以壮行色。
    卓越的人民解放军的将士们，英雄们，
    你们是六亿人民中的精华！
    你们在党的领导下，
    在毛主席的教导下，
    把帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的联军
    打成个流水落花。
    你们把中国的天下
    变成了六亿人民的天下；
    六亿人民作了主人，
    谁不称赞你们是顶呱呱！
    你们不仅有高度的武艺，
    更还有高度的文化，
    八年来祖国的生产建设、文教建设的各条战线上，
    哪一次伟大的战役没有你们在打？
    一个胜利紧接着一个胜利，
    一个革命紧接着一个革命，
    你们才真不愧是不断的革命家！
    现在你们有不少同志解甲归田，
    不，你们是转换阵地，向地球开战。
    毛主席说过：我们要先攻破地球表层，
    然后再进入外层空间。
    这样广阔无边的战场
    已经展开在我们六亿人民的面前。
    我国面积有一四四亿亩，
    但现有耕地只占百分之二十还少一点。
    我们的人口众多，
    平均分配虽然多过日本和英国，
    但比美国和苏联就相差很远。（注）
    我们要大大地开垦，
    南至海南岛，北至黑龙江边，
    西至世界屋顶帕米尔高原。
    海底和山顶都可以种植，
    大戈壁沙漠要设法变成良田。
    六亿人民的力量可以移山倒海，
    你们是卓越的战斗人员。
    你们所领导的是国营农牧场，
    一定要为全国的合作社示范。
    更何况我们的地底还有无限的宝藏，
    我们还要打开地下的仓库使宝物见天。
    同志们，技术革命的号角吹响了，
    我们要向科学技术大进军；
    钢铁生产十五年要赶上英国，
    科学技术十年内要赶上世界水平。
    全中国的劳动人民都在鼓足干劲，力争上游，
    农业和工业都出现着生产大跃进，
    这形势就像解放了的原子能，
    四处都在发生着链锁反应。
    主席说：全民族发扬蹈厉，大有希望，
    我们要以普通劳动者自处，跟踪前进！
    是的，任何障碍都阻挡不了我们，
    不管山怎么样高，水怎么样深，
    火怎么样热，冰怎么样冷。
    我们不是已经征服了长江，征服了秦岭？
    高温的炼钢炉旁边，越热越振奋；
    零下二十度也在进行水利工程？
    三门峡和三峡要像小猫那样驯，
    我们要看到汪洋的黄海转成一片天青。
    是的，只有愚人的字典里面，
    才能寻找得出这个字——“不可能”。
    在今天，当然我们还只在国内活动，
    到了明天，我们的情况就会大不相同。
    我们要到南极冰原，也要到北极圈中，
    还要到月球里去，访问广寒宫。
    杨开慧和柳直荀烈士可能还在那儿作客，
    是吴刚和嫦娥还在联合做东。
    当然，那里一定有了苏联朋友，
    中苏大联欢，红旗使宇宙通红。
    毫无疑问，东风已经压倒了西风，
    也就是西风都变成了东风。
    和暖的东风永恒不息地吹送，
    使全世界、全宇宙都一片春意葱茏。
    人种已不分红、黄、黑、白、棕，
    都是姊妹，都是弟兄。
    当然，在那时也还会有矛盾存在，
    但在人民内部总有办法通融。
    别的星球或许也有人类更加进步，
    我们要交流经验，争取宇宙大同。
    同志们，这是不是幻想呢？
    不，这正是马克思主义的造极登峰。
    但我并不想多用力来歌颂明天，
    我只想多用力来在今天把你们歌颂。
    赶快向地球开战吧，同志们，
    无论在天涯海角，让我们陷阵冲锋！
          （一九五八年三月二十三日）
