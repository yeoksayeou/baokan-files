    Guangdong Achieves Bumper Wheat Harvest
    (Our report) Guangdong Province's more than four million mu of spring-harvested wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. According to statistics, the total wheat output of the province reached 340 million jin, an increase of more than 95% compared with the same period last year.
    From the beginning of the harvest to the recent completion of all wheat harvesting, a joyous harvest scene was seen everywhere in the vast rural areas, and news of increased production was constantly spreading in all directions.
    At present, the golden wheat in various places has been safely stored in warehouses, and some of it has been pre-distributed to commune members for consumption. Many farmers were overjoyed to receive so much good wheat.
    In the past few years, the increase in wheat production in Guangdong Province has been very slow. Last year, the average yield per mu in the province was only over 50 jin, but this year, after processing fertilizer and conscientious management, the yield generally reached 70 or 80 jin, and some reached more than 100 jin, proving that the potential for increased production in the province is very large.

    广东小麦大丰收
    本报讯　广东省四百多万亩春收小麦，获得了空前的大丰收。据统计，全省小麦的总产量共达到三亿四千万斤，比去年同期增产95％以上。
    从开镰时始，到最近全部麦子收割终了，广大的农村到处都呈现一片欢欣的丰收景象，增产的捷报不断地四面传扬。
    目前，各地金黄色的麦子已经安全入仓，有一部分已经预分给社员食用。许多农民分到这么多、这么好的麦子，都欢天喜地。
    广东省几年来小麦的增产是很缓慢的，去年全省平均每亩只有五十多斤，但今年经过加工施肥和认真管理后，一般都收到七、八十斤，有的达一百多斤，证明全省增产的潜力是很大的。　（李少球）
