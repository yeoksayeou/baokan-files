    Developing the Primitive Forests of the Greater Khingan Range
    (Our report) The primitive forests of the Greater Khingan Range have entered a stage of large-scale development.

    The number of newly established forestry enterprises this year has increased from the originally planned two to five. Several forestry enterprises built during the First Five-Year Plan will continue to be expanded. The railways built by the Ministry of Railways will continue to extend into the primitive forests. The two narrow-gauge forest railways built by Inner Mongolia forestry enterprises this year will reach over 110 kilometers, and the total length of the four highways built will be nearly 300 kilometers. In addition, a large-scale comprehensive timber processing plant and a forest product chemical complex, along with six small power stations, will be built within the year. A machinery repair factory will also be expanded. The total construction area will reach more than 100,000 square meters. Communication and lighting equipment will also be added along with these constructions. The increased construction projects this year, due to the production increase and economy measures proposed by the Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Administration in the "Double-Anti" movement, can basically be solved by themselves without asking the state for more investment.

    The surveying and design team of the Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Administration Design Company entered the mountains in late March and began surveying and designing for the forestry enterprises.

    Currently, the ice and snow in the Greater Khingan Range are melting, and a large number of construction workers have successively entered the mountains. Earth and stone works for several forest railway subgrades, bridges, and house constructions commenced in late March, half a month to a month earlier than in previous years. The grain, tools, and other supplies needed by the construction workers entering the mountains have been transported before the thaw.

    开发大兴安岭原始森林
    本报讯　大兴安岭原始森林已经进入大开发的阶段。
    今年新建的林业企业已从原计划的两个增加到五个。有几个在第一个五年计划期间建设的林业企业要继续扩建。铁道部修筑的铁路将继续向原始森林中延伸。内蒙古林业企业今年修建的两条窄轨森林铁路将达一百数十公里，修建的四条公路的总长近三百公里。此外，一座大型的综合木材加工厂和林产化学联合企业、六个小型发电站要在年内兴建。一座机械修理厂也要扩建。这些建筑总面积达十多万平方公尺。通讯照明设备也要随着这些建设增添。今年增加的建设项目，由于内蒙古森林工业管理局在双反运动中提出了一些增产节约措施，投资问题基本上可以自己解决，不向国家多要。
    内蒙古森林工业管理局设计公司的勘测设计队已于3月下旬进山，开始林业企业的勘测设计工作。
    目前，大兴安岭冰雪正在消融，大批建筑工人已经陆续进山。几项森林铁路路基、桥梁、房屋等建筑的土、石方工程3月下旬已开工，比往年动工时间提早半月到一个月。供应进山建筑职工需用的粮食、工具等，已于化冻前赶运完毕。
