Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd: A young painter in New York named Jerry Domok recently spent ten days in jail for stealing six loaves of bread worth a total of 45 cents, driven by hunger.

Domok, who lives in Greenwich Village, New York, explained that he had painted all day and only had one meal. Late at night, he was wandering the streets, passed a bakery, and the smell of the bread made his mouth water and his stomach rumble. So, he broke into the shop and stole six loaves of bread, but as he was walking out the door, a policeman blocked his path with a gun in his hand.

Domok was sent to prison on charges of disorderly conduct, and none of his friends could come up with the $1,000 bail to get him out.

    纽约一画家没饭吃  偷窃面包被捕入狱
    新华社22日讯　纽约消息：纽约有一个叫杰里·多莫克的青年画家最近在监狱里被关了十天，原因是由于饥饿所迫，偷了一共值四角五分钱的六块面包。
    多莫克住在纽约的格林威治村，他解释说这一天他画了一整天而只吃了一顿东西。深夜，他上街闲荡，经过一家面包房，面包的香味使他口涎欲滴，饥肠难忍，于是他闯进店里偷了六块面包，可是正当他走出大门时，门口一个警察手里拿着手枪挡住了他的去路。
    多莫克就在行为失检的罪名下被送进了监狱，他的所有朋友中没有一个人能拿得出一千块钱的保释金来保释他出狱的。
