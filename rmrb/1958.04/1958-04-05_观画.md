Viewing Paintings
Lao She

After seeing the landscape painting exhibition of six gentlemen, including Wu Jingting and Qin Zhongwen (location: Huafang斋 in Beihai Park), I have some thoughts:

I am happy to say: Traditional landscape painting has not reached a dead end. There are many new attempts and successes in the works in this exhibition. The construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, various construction sites, the earthen mountains and cave dwellings in the Northwest, realistic depictions of rural life, etc., have all been incorporated into the paintings, and they are not bad-looking. This shows that once conservative thinking is broken, it can break through conventions and create a new look. The painting method must not be immutable and unchangeable.

Yes, the innovation of landscape painting is a matter of technique, but also a matter of whether the painter loves new things and the working people. In a small painting by Mr. Zhou Yuanliang, he painted villagers picking up manure on the road. Oh my, if this were before liberation, wouldn't it have infuriated the high-minded scholars and gentlemen half to death! Green hills and clear waters have always been the hiding place for hermits in ancient attire; who would dare to paint manure pickers? That's too vulgar! However, after Mr. Zhou understood the value of labor and the loveliness of the working people, his courage grew, regardless of how angry the high-minded scholars and gentlemen might be. What was the result? Although this painting is not without its shortcomings, it is still very beautiful. Loving the new society is the only way to care about new things and dare to paint pictures with new content. This is more important than reforming techniques. Those who look down on the working people will not put them in beautiful scenery.

The six gentlemen's brushwork all has a foundation, so although the content is new, it still looks like traditional landscape painting. The most prominent point is the novel composition; most of the works have abandoned the old pattern of mountain peaks and pine forests夹着 a waterfall, and instead take scenes from reality, each painting what they see. They painted scenery that is not found in painting manuals or albums. This proves that the reason why landscape painting has been so rigid in recent years is not a problem with the tradition of landscape painting itself, but because the painters are lazy, only taking drafts from painting manuals and ancient works, simply moving the mountain peaks and waterfalls around and calling it a new painting. In this way, the scenery everyone paints is almost the same, so they can only determine the merits based on the interest of the brush and ink, to the point where outsiders can't understand it and find it unfathomable. As a result, the great rivers and mountains of the motherland are disconnected from landscape painting, and the broad masses of the people are also disconnected from landscape painting. This loss is not small. Under these circumstances, painters often inscribe in their paintings: imitating Wang Shigu, or imitating the method of Da Dizi, etc. Imitation is not a very respectable thing, but the painters actually boast about it, indeed forgetting to promote the old and bring forth the new, and the future of landscape painting is greatly worrying! Most of the works in this exhibition, because they are new attempts, are of course not fully mature. However, things that are not yet mature today will grow up tomorrow and gradually become mature. We should look further ahead.

The new composition will inevitably lead to two innovations: the reform of techniques and the change of the question of what is beauty. Mr. Guan Songfang's "Morning Mist" depicts a construction site, and Mr. Zhou Yuanliang also painted the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir, etc. Their choice of scenes and composition are unprecedented. Therefore, they also need new techniques. Obviously, in addition to traditional painting methods, they also absorbed some Western painting techniques. This is inevitable. To promote the old and bring forth the new, we must think of more ways to enrich our techniques. We can also see that although they have absorbed some new painting methods, they still strive not to lose the characteristics of traditional landscape painting. This will inevitably have many difficulties. I hope everyone (including insiders, outsiders; Chinese painters and Western painters) will have a good discussion about what to do. The era of “creating” landscapes without leaving home seems to have passed. Today, we should let the broad masses of the people see the motherland's magnificent rivers and mountains from paintings, so that everyone will love the motherland more. This is not a small matter, and everyone should express their opinions and solve the difficulties in innovative practice. However, when exchanging opinions, be sure not to pour cold water first!

It is possible that some people will pour cold water because they cannot get used to the setting and composition of the new landscape paintings. This brings us to the question of what is beauty. I don't understand aesthetics, so I don't dare to talk nonsense. I only know that after getting used to the old landscape paintings that don't touch the sky or the ground, looking at the new landscape paintings that combine with real life, I am afraid it will be a little unpleasant to the eye, and if it is unpleasant to the eye, it will also be unpleasant to the heart. I hope aesthetics experts will also come and talk about whether the absolute beauty is an empty mountain without seeing people, or whether it can be changed? Theoretical basis will give practitioners more courage to reform.

Perhaps some people will say: The new paintings in this exhibition are just drafts and cannot be regarded as mature works. The implication is that these paintings can be exhibited, or they can not be exhibited. I do not agree with this view. From the perspective of the painter, it is wrong to be proud and complacent as soon as you have a little experience. From our point of view, if new seedlings are not allowed to show their faces, new flowers will not be able to bloom. Even if this exhibition is all drafts, why can't they meet with the people? Besides, historically, imitations of so-and-so's exercises should be called drafts, but they are valued, even hidden in museums and galleries. Why shouldn't innovative and creative works be exhibited?

    观画
    老舍
    看了吴镜汀、秦仲文等六位先生的山水画展览（地点：北海公园内画舫斋），有些感想：
    我高兴地说：传统的山水画并未走到山穷水尽之境。这次展览的作品中有许多新的尝试与成功。修建十三陵水库、各样工地、西北的土山窑洞，农村生活写实等等已都入画，而且并不难看。足见保守思想一经打掉，即能突破陈规，别开生面。画法一定不是一成不变，万不可改的。
    是的，山水画的革新是技法问题，也是画家对新事物和劳动人民爱不爱的问题。在周元亮先生的一幅小画里，画的是乡民在路上拾粪。哎呀，这要是放在解放前，岂不使高人雅士气个半死么！青山绿水画面里向来是古代衣冠的隐士的藏身之处，谁敢画上拾粪的呢？这太不雅了！可是，在周先生明白了劳动的可贵与劳动人民的可爱之后，他的胆子就大起来，不管高人雅士怎么生气了。结果怎样呢：这张画虽然不无缺点，可是也还很美。爱新社会才能关心新事物，才敢画出有新内容的画来，这比改革技法更要紧。看不起劳动人民的不会把他们放在美景里。
    六位先生的笔墨都有根底，所以内容虽新，看起来却还是传统的山水画。最突出的一点是构图新颖；大多数的作品已经放弃山峰松林夹着一条瀑布的老套子，而按实取景，各绘所见。他们画了画谱画册中所没有过的景色。这就证明：近些年来山水画的所以死死板板，并不是山水画传统本身的毛病，而是因为画家懒惰，只从画谱与古人作品中取稿，给山峰与瀑布搬搬家就算一张新画。这样，大家所画的景物全差不多，只好专从笔墨趣味上断定优劣，以至叫外行人看不懂，莫测高深。于是祖国的伟大山河与山水画脱了节，广大人民也与山水画脱了节。这个损失不小。在这种情形下，画家们往往在画中题上：仿王石谷，或拟大涤子法等等。摹仿本非极体面的事，可是画家竟自以此自夸，的确忘了推陈出新，而山水画的前途乃大为可虑！这次展览中的大部分作品，因为是新的尝试，当然不尽成熟。可是，今天还未成熟的东西，明天就会成长起来，渐至成熟。我们应当看得远一些。
    新的构图必然引起两种革新：技法的改革与什么是美的问题的改变。关松房先生的“晓雾”画的是建筑工地，周元亮先生也画了修建十三陵水库等等。他们的取景构图都前无古人。因此，他们也需要新的技法。很明显，他们在传统的画法外，还吸收了一些洋画的技巧。这是必然的。要推陈出新，就必须多想办法，丰富技巧。我们也看得出，他们虽然吸收了一些新画法，可是还力求不失去传统山水画的特色。这就必有不少的困难。我希望大家（包括内行，外行；国画家与西画家）都好好地谈一谈，到底应当怎么办。足不出户，“创造”山水的时代似乎已经过去了。我们今天应当叫广大人民从绘画中看见祖国的灿烂如锦的山河，使大家更爱祖国。这不是件小事，大家应当多发表意见，解决革新实践中的困难。可是，在交换意见的时候，千万先别泼凉水！
    可能有人泼点凉水，因为看不惯新山水画的设景构图。这就来到什么是美的问题了。我不懂美学，不敢乱说。我只知道：看惯了上不着天，下不着地的老山水画，再看结合现实生活的新山水画，恐怕有点不顺眼，不顺眼也就不顺心。我希望美学专家也来谈谈：空山不见人是绝对的美呢，还是也可以改一改呢？有理论的根据，会叫实践者增加改革的勇气。
    也许有人说：这次展览的新画还不过是画稿，不能算是成熟的作品。意在言外，这些画可以展览，也可以不展览。我不同意这个看法。由画家来说，稍有心得，即骄傲自满，是不对的。由我们来说，不许新苗露面，新的花朵即无从开放，即使这次展览的都是画稿，为什么不可以和人民见面呢？再说，历来仿谁仿谁的习作才正应当称为画稿，反倒受到重视，以至藏在博物院与画馆中，为什么革新的有些创造性的作品不该展览呢？
