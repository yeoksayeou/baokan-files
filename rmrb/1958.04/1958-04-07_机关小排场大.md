    The newly established preparatory office of the Taiyuan Glass Bottle Factory in Shanxi Province, though it hasn't started production, has already spent 5,000 yuan on furniture. Currently, the entire factory has only thirty-odd employees, yet they have bought eleven sofas of various sizes and spent 450 yuan on a safe. In addition, they purchased many desks priced at 46 yuan each and leather-padded chairs priced at 16 yuan each, and other items such as filing cabinets, good beds, bicycles, glass panels, etc., everything one could want.

    This preparatory office may be small, but its display of extravagance is not. During this high tide of the "Double-Anti" campaign, it is absolutely necessary for the leading cadres of this preparatory office to set fire to themselves, thoroughly burning away the official airs and extravagance on their bodies.

    刚成立的山西省太原玻璃瓶厂筹备处，虽然还没有开工生产，却先花五千元购置家具。目前全厂仅有职工三十余人，就买了大小十一个沙发，并花四百五十元买了一台保险柜。此外还购买不少台单价四十六元的办公桌及单价十六元的皮垫椅，其他如公文柜、好床铺、自行车、玻璃板等等，应有尽有。
    这个筹备处虽小，但排场却不小。当此“双反”高潮期间，该筹备处的领导干部，十分必要引火烧身，把自己身上的官气和阔气彻底烧掉。
