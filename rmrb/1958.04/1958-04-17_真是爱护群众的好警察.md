Truly a Good Policeman Who Loves the People

　　The rain kept falling, getting heavier and heavier. Mother anxiously asked, "Why haven't Aunt Jiao and the others come back yet?" I said, "She doesn't have a raincoat; she's probably taking shelter from the rain somewhere." The room was very quiet at this moment; no one spoke, and we could only hear the dripping of rain on the ground. Suddenly, there were footsteps outside. Before I could ask who it was, a woman wearing a raincoat and holding a child walked into the house. Upon closer look, it was Aunt Jiao, holding little Jian'an. I asked in surprise, "Where did you get the raincoat?" It turned out that Aunt Jiao had taken little Jian'an to see a movie that day, and it wasn't over until after 9:00 p.m. Unexpectedly, it started to rain. When they reached the intersection, the rain became even heavier, so they had to take shelter from the rain in front of the cooperative. At this time, a police comrade on duty came over and immediately took off his raincoat, asking them to wear the raincoat to go home. He would rather get wet himself. He truly deserves to be called a good policeman of the people.

    真是爱护群众的好警察
    雨不断地下着，越来越大，母亲焦急地问：焦婶他们怎么还不回来？我说：她没有雨衣可能在外面避雨呢。这时屋里非常寂静，没有人再说话，只听雨水落地的滴滴声。突然，外面传来了脚步声，我还没来得及问是谁？只见一个穿雨衣抱着孩子的女人，走进屋来，定睛一看，正是焦婶，抱着的是小健安。我惊奇地问：你哪里来的雨衣啊？原来焦婶这天带着小健安去看电影，晚九点多才散场，没想到下起雨来了，走到十字口时，雨下得更大了，只好在合作社门前避雨。这时，一位值班的警察同志走来，马上脱下雨衣，要他们穿着雨衣回去。宁肯自己淋雨，真不愧是人民的好警察。　北京　徐贵林
