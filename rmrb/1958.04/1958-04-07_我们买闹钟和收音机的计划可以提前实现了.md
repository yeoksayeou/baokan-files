    Our Plan to Buy an Alarm Clock and Radio Can Be Realized Ahead of Schedule
    When we learned from the newspaper that commodities such as medicines, radios, and alarm clocks had been reduced in price, we felt very happy.
    After the Party Central Committee put forward the great call to "catch up with Britain in major industrial products within fifteen years," it not only stimulated the production of heavy industry, but also had a huge encouraging and driving effect on workers on the entire industrial front. The great "Double-Anti" movement has also brought about earth-shaking changes in our country; due to the great leap forward in industrial production and the formation of a trend of diligence and thrift in running enterprises and all undertakings, there has been a reduction in the cost of industrial products, while the quality and output have been greatly improved and increased. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the prices of medicines, radios, alarm clocks, and fluorescent tubes, as well as leather shoes in some areas, which are extremely important for people's health and cultural entertainment.
    The price reduction of these commodities makes us deeply realize that only when the production of means of production develops prior to the production of means of livelihood can the people's living standards be improved. In the past, our country could not manufacture the raw materials for these commodities, so these commodities could not be bought very cheaply, which was correct. Otherwise, our country's foreign exchange outflow would be too large. Now that our industry has developed and many important raw materials can be produced, the prices of commodities can be reduced.
    We are a newly married couple. We once had a plan to "save on other expenses, buy an alarm clock in half a year, and buy a radio in three years." Now, due to the price reduction of these commodities, this wish can be realized ahead of schedule.
    We look forward to our motherland having its own atomic energy power stations and jet airliners; we also hope to have domestically produced daily necessities of high quality and large quantity; we even more hope that our comrades fighting on the industrial front will produce a large number of inexpensive and high-quality watches and the televisions that people have been looking forward to day and night as soon as possible!
    Seeing our country becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, seeing our people's living standards continuously improving, and thinking about the happy future of the next generation, we cannot restrain the excitement in our hearts. We want to cheer: "Long live the people's regime led by the working class!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"

### 我们买闹钟和收音机的计划可以提前实现了

    我们买闹钟和收音机的计划可以提前实现了
    当我们从报纸上得知药品、收音机、闹钟等商品降价的消息时，心情非常愉快。
    党中央提出“十五年内在重要工业产品方面赶上英国”的伟大号召后，不但刺激了重工业的生产，对整个工业战线上的职工都有巨大的鼓舞作用和推动作用。伟大的“双反”运动又使我们国家的面貌发生日新月异的变化；由于工业生产大跃进和勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的风气的形成，在工业产品的成本上有了降低，而在质量和产量上又有了不少提高和增加。因此这些对于人民健康和文化娱乐生活有极为重要关系的药品、收音机、闹钟和日光灯管以及某些地区的皮鞋等才有可能降低价格。
    这些商品的降价使我们深深体会到只有生产资料的生产优先于生活资料生产的发展，人民生活水平的提高才有可能。过去国内制造不出这些商品的原材料，因而这些商品的价格不能很便宜的买到，那是对的。否则我们国家的外汇输出太大了。现在我们的工业发展了，许多重要的原材料能生产了，所以商品的价格就能降低。
    我俩是一对新婚夫妇。我们曾经有过“节省其它开支，半年买闹钟，三年买架收音机”的计划。现在由于这些商品降价，可以提前实现这个愿望了。
    我们盼望祖国有自己的原子能发电站和喷气客机；我们也希望有国产的质高量大的各种日用品；我们更希望战斗在工业战线上的伙伴们，尽快地生产出大批价廉物美的手表和人们日夜盼望的电视机来！
    看到我们国家日益富强，看到我们人民生活水平不断提高，想到下一代的幸福的未来，我们就竭止不住心头的激动。我们要欢呼：“工人阶级领导的人民政权万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
