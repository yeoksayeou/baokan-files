Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Electric Dispatch: Chongqing No. 9 People's Hospital recently established a rural hospital for farmers in Caijia Township, Beibei Suburbs, at a cost of only 180 yuan.

　　This relatively large-scale rural hospital, equipped with internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology departments, has only seventeen people, including four doctors and six nurses. In less than a month, they have received nearly a thousand outpatients. Many farmers have recovered their health in the hospital's simple beds and left the hospital in a happy mood.

　　At the end of February this year, Chongqing No. 9 People's Hospital decided to establish a rural hospital based on the requests of doctors, pharmacists, and nurses. The medical staff, having been educated through rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, were very motivated. After identifying the hospital site on February 27, they staffed it on the 28th. On March 1, they equipped the new hospital with the necessary equipment. The next day, they started seeing patients. Farmers said: In the past, when someone got sick, it took two people to carry them to the city on a sedan chair, and someone had to be sent to decoct medicine, delaying several people; now, they can see a doctor as soon as they put down their hoes.

　　The staff of this rural hospital operate entirely in accordance with the characteristics of the countryside. They do not set fixed consultation hours; patients are seen as soon as they arrive. Patients bring their own bedding when they are hospitalized and are only charged two jiao per day. The hospital has set up a special stove for light patients to cook their own meals, saving on food expenses. Farmers generally reflect that this is the kind of doctor and hospital that peasants need.

    重庆开办一所乡村医院
    据新华社重庆电　重庆第九人民医院不久以前为郊区北碚蔡家乡的农民办成一所乡村医院，只用了一百八十元。
    这所设有内科、外科、儿科和妇产科的颇具规模的乡村医院，只有十七个人，包括四个医生和六个护士。他们在不到一个月的时间里，接待的门诊人数将近一千人次。很多农民在医院简朴的病床上恢复了健康，带着愉快的心情出院。
    今年2月底，重庆第九人民医院根据医师、药剂师、护士们的要求，决定办一所乡村医院。医务人员们经过整风和反右派斗争的教育，干劲大得很，他们在2月27日看好院址后，28日就配齐了工作人员。3月1日把新医院需要的设备配齐。第二天就开始诊病。农民们说：以前一个人生病，要两个人用滑竿抬到城里去，还要派人煎汤熬药，耽误好几个人；现在只要一丢下锄头就可以看病了。
    这所乡村医院的工作人员完全按照乡村的特点办事。不规定固定的看病时间，病人随到随看。病人住院自带被子，每天只收费两角。院里专门设了锅灶，供轻病人自己烧饭吃，节省伙食费。农民们普遍反映：这才是庄稼人需要的医生和医院。
