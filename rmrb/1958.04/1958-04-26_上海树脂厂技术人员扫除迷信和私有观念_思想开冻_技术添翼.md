Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 25th: The technicians of the jointly-owned Shanghai Resin Factory, in the Two-Anti Campaign, have broken down their superstition towards the technology of Western capitalist countries and criticized the concept of private ownership of technology. Their minds have begun to liberate, and a new situation of great leaps forward has emerged in production technology. Five types of newly emerging resin products in the world, originally planned to be produced in four or five years, have now been successfully trial-produced in a very short time, and some have already been put into production. They have decided to increase seven new categories of products and thirty new varieties this year, and strive to bring the quality of both old and new products in the factory up to the level of famous brands from countries such as England, the United States, the Netherlands, West Germany, and Japan within two or three years.

The 1958 technical plan formulated by the factory at the end of last year was very conservative. There were no new categories of products added, and only ten new varieties. The factory's technicians believed that the British resin industry had decades of history, while this factory had been established for less than two years, with a low technical level, making it difficult to catch up. This inferiority complex, generated by superstition in the technology of Western capitalist countries, tightly bound their hands and feet.

As soon as the Two-Anti Campaign began, tens of thousands of big-character posters appeared in the factory within two days, about one-third of which focused on criticizing the conservative thinking of the technicians. Many workers revealed:
"The lack of unity among technicians and the lack of transparency in technology are also fundamental reasons for technological backwardness."

This situation greatly encouraged and spurred the resin factory's technicians. They held meetings overnight to clean up their conservative thinking. They saw that the production and technology of many factories were making great leaps forward, and realized that as long as they dared to think and act, anything could be done. The technicians further examined their thinking. Some said: In the past, they feared that others would take away "personal honor," so they kept technical secrets from workers and other technicians. During trial production, they not only controlled the key operations themselves, but even hid the "formula" in their pockets when they went to the bathroom. They said that with such superficial unity and inability to leverage collective power, how could they catch up with England?

When the technicians' minds were liberated, especially after criticizing the concept of private ownership of technology, production also leaped forward. Of the seven new categories of products in this year's new plan, five have already been successfully trial-produced in the past two months, and some have already been put into production. For example, ion exchange resins, needed by the pharmaceutical industry to manufacture antibiotics, are one of the world's new resin products. In the past, they thought the technology was very mysterious and never considered producing it during the second five-year plan period. Now, with the help of relevant pharmaceutical research departments, they have not only successfully trial-produced it, but also put it into medium-scale production last month, and started mass production a few days ago. Organosilicon resins, which are both heat-resistant and cold-resistant, were originally planned to be produced in 1962. Recently, under the leadership of the superior company's laboratory, they have also successfully trial-produced three types, and are preparing to start mass production in May. They have also successfully trial-produced five types of epoxy resins, which were put into medium-scale production not long ago. The technicians' enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. During the intense period of trial-producing new products, they divided into three shifts and worked around the clock.

### 上海树脂厂技术人员扫除迷信和私有观念  思想开冻　技术添翼

    上海树脂厂技术人员扫除迷信和私有观念
    思想开冻　技术添翼
    据新华社上海25日电　公私合营上海树脂厂的技术人员，在双反运动中破除了对西方资本主义国家技术的迷信，批判了技术私有的观念，思想开始解放，生产技术上出现了大跃进的新局面。原来打算四、五年后才生产的五类世界上新出现的树脂产品，现在以很短的时间试制成功了，有的已经投入生产。他们决定在今年增加七类新产品，三十种新品种，并且争取在两三年内使全厂新老产品的质量，分别地赶上英、美、荷和西德、日本等国名牌产品的水平。
    这个厂在去年年底制订的1958年技术规划，十分保守。新产品没有增加，新品种只增加十种。厂里技术人员认为英国树脂工业有几十年历史，而本厂成立还不到两年，技术水平低，很难赶上。这种迷信西方资本主义国家技术而产生的自卑心理，紧紧地束缚着他们的手脚。
    双反运动一开始，两天内厂里出现了几万张大字报，其中约有三分之一的大字报，集中地批判技术人员的保守思想。很多工人揭露说：
  “技术人员不团结，技术不公开，也是造成技术落后的根本原因。”
    这种形势使树脂厂的技术人员受到很大鼓舞和鞭策。他们连夜开会，打扫自己的保守思想。他们看到许多工厂的生产、技术都在大跃进，体会到只要敢想敢作，什么事都可以作得出来。技术人员还进一步检查了自己的思想。有的说：过去怕别人夺去“个人的荣誉”，所以对工人、对别的技术人员保守技术秘密，在试制中，不仅关键性的操作都独自掌握，甚至去小便时也把“配方”藏在口袋里。他们说，像这样貌合神离，不能发挥集体力量，怎样去赶英国呢。
    当技术人员思想得到解放，特别是批判了技术私有观念以后，生产也跟着跃进了。今年新规划中的七类新产品，在最近两月内已经有五类试制成功，有些并已投入生产。如医药工业制造抗生素需要的离子交换树脂，是世界上的树脂新产品之一，过去他们认为技术很奥妙，根本没有考虑到在第二个五年计划期内生产。现在他们在有关医药研究部门的帮助下，不但试制成功，而且在上月投入了中型生产，几天前又开始了大量生产。既能耐高温又能耐寒的有机硅树脂，原来打算在1962年生产。最近他们在上级公司试验室的领导下，也已试制成功三种，准备在5月份就大量生产。他们还试制成功五种环氧树脂，不久前已投入中型生产。技术人员的积极性空前高涨，在试制新产品紧张的时候，他们分成三班日夜不停地工作。
