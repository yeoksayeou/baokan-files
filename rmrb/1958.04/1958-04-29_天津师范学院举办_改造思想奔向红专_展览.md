Tianjin Normal College's ideological remolding movement for intellectuals is gradually deepening. Currently, the voluntary and conscious "heart-to-heart" movement has come to an end, and is now shifting to focusing on problems. Through debate, the aim is to initially resolve the issue of political stance, preparing for a critique of bourgeois pedagogical thought.

On April 3rd, based on the "heart-to-heart" movement, the college held a faculty and staff "Transform Thinking and Strive for Redness and Expertise" exhibition. The exhibition displayed "heart-to-heart" confessions from democratic parties and non-party individuals, excerpts from big-character posters highlighting "watermelons" (people who are red outside but white inside), and individuals' plans for becoming both "red" (politically correct) and "expert" (professionally competent). The exhibition proved highly beneficial. Particularly the personal confession section, where teachers and students had a relatively deep understanding of their own ideological problems, led them to voluntarily explain their issues to the audience, making this the most effective part. Hu Shixiang, director of the Psychology Teaching and Research Office, had expressed many right-wing opinions during the blooming and contending period, and had not recognized his errors even during the anti-Rightist struggle. His self-criticism remained superficial. However, at the exhibition, comrades encouraged him and pointed out contradictions in his self-criticism, which led to increasingly profound explanations. He said, "Previously, I was full of worries, fearing that if I confessed, the leaders and comrades would look down on me. But after speaking, the leaders and comrades showed me such care that I felt I had no reason to hold anything back from the Party." Pei Xuehai, a lecturer in the Chinese Department, after hearing encouragement from the masses, said he would go back and think hard, and make a further confession.

It is a progressive step for teachers to reveal their erroneous thoughts, and standing before the masses to explain them is an even greater step forward. Qian Junye, deputy director of the History Department, said, "Going from writing to standing before the masses to speak is not an easy thing. It is a process of ideological struggle." The Physical Education Teaching and Research Office was a lagging unit, but after seeing the exhibition, the teachers of this office deeply excavated their thoughts and confessed to the Party. Li Wenxiu even submitted seventy items while sick. The college leadership also organized all students to visit the exhibition, which not only gave great encouragement to the teachers but also greatly inspired and educated the students. Students from the Department of Chemistry Three wrote in the suggestion book after seeing the exhibition, "After seeing the teachers' ideological exhibition, we feel that our own exhibition and critique are not deep enough. We must continue to dig into our thinking."

Currently, the ideological remolding movement for intellectuals in this college has entered a deeper stage. In addition to adopting methods such as "joint consultation," individual enlightenment, the influence and drive of the masses, and individual assistance for those who show resistance, the general faculty are currently addressing the issue of political stance through debate. This will extend to an in-depth critique of bourgeois ideology in teaching.

### 天津师范学院举办“改造思想奔向红专”展览

    天津师范学院举办“改造思想奔向红专”展览
    本报讯　天津师范学院的知识分子思想改造运动渐趋深入。目前，自觉自愿的交心运动已经告一段落，正转入集中问题，通过辩论初步解决政治立场问题，准备进行对资产阶级教学思想的批判。
    这个学院在交心运动的基础上在4月3日举办了教职员的“改造思想、奔向红专”展览会。会上展览了民主党派和无党派人士的交心书，大字报中选择的“西瓜”和个人的红专规划。这个展览会的收获是很大的。特别是个人交心书部分，由于教师学生对自己的思想问题有了比较深刻的认识，所以他们都自觉自愿地在展览会上向观众讲解自己的问题，因此这部分的效果也最好。心理学教研室主任胡士襄在鸣放中发表过不少右派言论，在反右派斗争中对自己的错误仍未认识。直到后来，他的检查还是很不深刻。但是，在展览会上有的同志对他加以鼓励，并且指出检查中的矛盾，他的讲解就一次比一次深刻了。他说：“以前顾虑重重，怕交代了领导和同志看不起，但是讲完了领导和同志对我这样关怀，我感到没有任何理由要对党有保留了。”中文系讲师裴学海听到群众鼓励，表示回去还要好好想想，作进一步的交心。
    教师把自己的错误思想交出来是一个进步，站在广大群众面前讲解更是一个很大的进步。历史系副主任钱君烨说：“从写到站在群众面前讲，不是一件容易的事，这是一个思想斗争的过程。”体育教研室是一个后进的单位，但是这个教研室的教师看了展览会后，深刻挖掘自己的思想向党交心，李文秀在病中还交了七十条。这个学院的领导上还组织全体学生参观这个展览会，这就不仅给教师很大的鼓舞，而且使学生得到很大的启发和教育。化三学生看了展览会后，在意见簿上写道：“看了老师们的思想展览，感到我们的展览会批判得不深刻，我们要继续挖掘思想。”
    目前，这个学院的知识分子思想改造运动已转入深入阶段。除对个别有抵触情绪的采取“就医会诊”、个别启发、群众影响带动、个别帮助外，在一般教师中正通过辩论初步解决政治立场问题，并将深入到对教学中资产阶级思想的批判。
