Naked Intervention
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

On April 7th, the U.S. State Department issued a statement openly expressing its "regret" over the Indonesian government's purchase of weapons from socialist countries. U.S. State Department spokesman White also said at a press conference that the United States does not approve of the Indonesian government's suppression of armed rebellion groups; the Indonesian government's current approach cannot help resolve the Indonesian issue "in the way the United States hopes." This is another naked intervention by the United States in Indonesia's internal affairs.

Indonesia is an independent country, and its purchase of weapons from foreign countries, like the purchase of anything else, is entirely within the scope of its sovereignty, and others have no right to interfere. The U.S. State Department's public expression of "regret" is clearly an attempt to threaten and blackmail the Indonesian government, preventing Indonesia from exercising its sovereignty and safeguarding its independence.

White said that the United States does not approve of the Indonesian government's suppression of armed rebellion groups, which is not surprising. Indonesian and world public opinion have long exposed the collusion between U.S. imperialism and the rebellion groups; however, in the past, U.S. official spokesmen have always tried to conceal and deny this. Now, White has confessed the relationship between the United States and the rebellion groups without being forced. However, the suppression of rebellion groups is entirely a matter for the Indonesian government and people, and has nothing to do with whether the United States approves or not. Indonesia is an independent country, so why must its policies and actions conform to the "hopes" of the U.S. State Department? White's arrogant remarks are not only an interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, but also an insult to the Indonesian people!

The Indonesian government's purchase of weapons from foreign countries is aboveboard, and its suppression of armed rebellion groups is even more justified. However, the United States secretly and unscrupulously provides arms to the rebels, threatening Indonesia's independence and Asian peace, which is a despicable and shameless crime. The Indonesian people and the Asian people truly have the right to express "regret" to the United States, and not just "regret"! Further U.S. interference in Indonesia's internal affairs will only further arouse the indignation of the Indonesian people and the people of Asian countries. Whether the United States approves or not, the Indonesian government and people will carry out the struggle to defend their independence to the end, and they will surely win victory.

    赤裸裸的干涉
    本报评论员
    4月7日美国国务院发表一项声明，公开表示对印度尼西亚政府向社会主义国家购买武器“感到很遗憾”。美国国务院发言人怀特，并且在记者招待会上说：美国不赞成印度尼西亚政府镇压武装叛乱集团；印度尼西亚政府目前的做法不能有助于使印度尼西亚问题“像美国所希望的那样获得解决”。这是美国对印度尼西亚内政的又一次赤裸裸的干涉。
    印度尼西亚是一个独立国家，它向外国购买武器，如同购买其它任何东西一样，完全是属于它的主权份内的事情，别人根本无权过问。美国国务院现在公然出来对此表示“遗憾”，这显然是企图对印度尼西亚政府进行威胁和讹诈，使印度尼西亚不能行使自己的主权，卫护自己的独立。
    怀特说美国不赞成印度尼西亚政府镇压武装叛乱集团，这并不奇怪。印度尼西亚和世界舆论早就揭露了美帝国主义和叛乱集团是串通一气的；不过过去美国官方发言人一直想加以掩饰和否认。现在，怀特倒是不打自招地供认了美国同叛乱集团的关系。但是，镇压叛乱集团完全是印度尼西亚政府和人民的事情，跟美国愿意与否毫不相干。印度尼西亚是一个独立国家，为什么它的政策和行动一定要符合美国国务院的“希望”呢？怀特这种狂妄的言论，不仅是对印度尼西亚内政的干涉，而且是对印度尼西亚人民的侮辱！
    印度尼西亚政府向外国购买武器是光明正大的，它镇压武装叛乱集团更是天经地义的。而美国偷偷摸摸不择手段地向叛乱分子提供军火，威胁印度尼西亚的独立和亚洲的和平，却是卑鄙无耻的罪恶行径。印度尼西亚人民和亚洲人民才真正有权利对美国表示“遗憾”，而且不仅仅是“遗憾”！美国进一步干涉印度尼西亚内政，只会更加激起印度尼西亚人民和亚洲各国人民的愤慨。不论美国愿意与否，印度尼西亚政府和人民将把捍卫独立的斗争进行到底，并且一定要得到胜利。
