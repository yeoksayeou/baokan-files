Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The National Light Industry Products Exhibition, organized by the Ministry of Light Industry, opened today at the Soviet Exhibition Center in Beijing.

The purpose of holding this exhibition is to summarize the achievements made by China's light industry during the First Five-Year Plan period, point out the direction of light industry development during the Second Five-Year Plan, and promote the great leap forward in national light industry.

The new products on display from various industries demonstrate the rapid improvement of China's light industrial technology. The paper industry alone exhibited 114 new products. Many industrial papers that were previously dependent on imports, such as capacitor paper, cable paper, steel paper, and insulating paper, are now self-sufficient. The various products of the emerging plastics industry occupy an important position at the exhibition, including industrial gears, electrical switches, oil pipes, and faucets, as well as various colored raincoats, fiberglass, and artificial leather products used in people's daily lives. The exhibition also showcases advanced daily necessities and cultural products with complex manufacturing technologies, such as watches, cameras, pianos, and harps, as well as many new types of wine and canned goods.

The use of various wild and substitute raw materials is a major achievement of the light industry sector during the First Five-Year Plan. Currently, paper made from various grass fibers and waste materials accounts for more than 70% of machine-made paper. At the exhibition, you can see Xuan paper and stencil paper made from tree bark, offset and letterpress printing paper made from bagasse, and glazed paper and typing paper made from sorghum stalks and corn stalks. Their quality generally meets the requirements of product standards. In leather products, there are many products made from pigskin, river pig, and baiji dolphin skin. Among them, pigskin handbags and leather shoes are soft, delicate, beautiful, and practical. In the brewing industry section, there are many wines brewed from wild plants and substitutes such as acorns, Chinese yam, water caltrop, and kudzu root. In the oil industry section, there are more than 80 kinds of wild oilseeds and oils with higher oil yields, including cocklebur, seepweed seeds, and Chinese toon seeds, among other large oilseed crops.

The exhibition also focuses on elaborating the great significance of the comprehensive utilization of light industrial resources.

Going up to the mountains and down to the countryside to run small factories and promote the development of local industries is one of the themes of this exhibition. At the exhibition, you can see photos, charts, and models introducing various small factories. The equipment and production technology of these small factories are relatively simple, and they can fully utilize local human and material resources. Generally, they can be built with an investment of only one thousand to tens of thousands of yuan.

The exhibition will last for one month.

    过去五年的成就　今后五年的方向
    请看丰富多采的日用品
    全国轻工业产品展览会在京开幕
    据新华社10日讯　由轻工业部举办的全国轻工业产品展览会今天在北京苏联展览馆开幕。
    举办这个展览会的目的，是总结我国轻工业在第一个五年计划期间取得的成就，指出第二个五年计划轻工业发展的方向，推动全国轻工业的大跃进。
    会上陈列着的各个行业的新产品，显示出我国轻工业技术水平的迅速提高。其中仅造纸工业就展出了一百一十四种新产品，过去一向依赖进口的许多工业用纸，如电容器纸、电缆纸、钢纸、绝缘纸等，现在都已自给。新兴的塑料工业的各种产品在会上占了重要地位。其中有工业用的齿轮、电器开关、油管、水龙头，也有人们日常生活中使用的各色雨衣、玻璃布和人造皮革制品。会上还展出了手表、照相机、钢琴、竖琴等制造技术复杂的高级日用品和文化用品，以及许多新种类的酒和罐头等。
    利用各种野生和代用原料，是第一个五年计划期间轻工业部门的一项重大成就。目前利用各种草类纤维和废料造的纸，已经占机制纸的70％以上。在会上可以看到用树皮做的宣纸、铁笔腊纸，用蔗渣做的胶版和凸版印刷纸，用高粱秆和玉米秆做的有光纸、打字纸等，它们的质量一般都能符合产品标准的要求。在皮革制品中，用猪皮、江猪、白鳍鱼皮作原料的也不少。其中猪皮手提包和皮鞋，质地柔软细致，既美观又实用。在酿造工业部分，摆着许多利用橡子、土茯苓、水蒺藜、葛根等野生植物和代用品酿制的酒；在油脂工业部分，有八十多种出油率较高的野生油料和油脂，其中包括苍耳子、盐蒿子、椿树子等大宗油料作物。
    会上还着重阐述了轻工业资源综合利用的巨大意义。
    上山下乡办小厂，促进地方工业发展，是这次展览会的主题之一。在会上可以看到介绍各类小型工厂的照片、图表和模型。这些小厂的设备和生产技术都比较简单，可以充分利用当地人力物力，一般只要一千多元到几万元投资就可以建成。
    这个展览会将展出一个月。
