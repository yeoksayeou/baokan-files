    Welcoming the National People's Sports Meet
    Beijing Builds the Largest Stadium in the Far East
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th - To welcome the first National People's Sports Meet to be held in early October next year, a large stadium capable of holding 83,000 people has begun construction in the eastern suburbs of Beijing.
    The stadium covers an area of 360,000 square meters. The grandstand can seat 75,000 people, and there are also gymnasiums and swimming pools, each with a capacity of 4,000 people. It will be the largest stadium in our country. A new stadium currently under construction in Tokyo, Japan, claiming to be the "largest in the Far East," can accommodate a total of 75,000 people.
    The large stadium being built in our country was designed by the Beijing Municipal Design Institute. The stadium includes an oval 400-meter cinder track, an artificial lake for boating in the summer and skating in the winter, a baseball field, two football fields, a track for practice in rainy weather, and gymnasiums for gymnastics, fencing, weightlifting, and other fitness activities. After the surrounding area of the stadium is fully greened, it will become a sports park in the eastern suburbs of Beijing.
    At the four corners of the stadium's grandstand, four steel-framed light towers, each 40 meters high, will be erected and equipped with night lighting. In this way, people can also watch sports competitions in the stadium at night.

    迎接中国人民体育运动大会
    北京兴建远东最大运动场
    据新华社18日讯　为了迎接明年10月初举行的第一届中国人民体育运动大会，一个可容八万三千人的大运动场已开始在北京东郊兴建。
    这个运动场占地三十六万平方公尺，大看台能坐七万五千人，另外还有各可容纳四千人的体育馆和游泳馆。它将是我国目前最大的一个运动场。目前正在日本东京建造的一个号称“远东第一”的新体育场，共能容纳七万五千人。
    我国兴建的这个大运动场，是由北京市设计院设计的。运动场内包括有一个椭圆形的四百公尺红砖屑跑道，一个可供夏天划船冬天溜冰的人工湖，一个棒球场，两个足球场，有供雨天进行练习的跑道，有体操、击剑、举重等健身房。运动场周围全部绿化后，将成为北京东郊的一个体育公园。
    在运动场大看台的四角，将竖立四座高四十公尺的钢架灯塔，安装夜光设备。这样，人们在夜晚也可以观看运动场上的体育比赛。
