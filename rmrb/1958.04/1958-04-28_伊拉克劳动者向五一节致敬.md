    Iraqi workers greet May Day with confidence and hope. Socialist countries have achieved brilliant new victories in the struggle for the interests of workers and other people around the world. Iraq, the Arab countries, and billions of workers around the world place their hopes on the increasingly powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Workers regard the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp as the guiding beacon of their ranks, the place where their great hopes lie, and the ally in their arduous struggle for liberation, peace, and a better life. The Soviet Union and the entire powerful socialist camp stand with the Arab people in their fierce anti-colonialist struggle, encouraging the morale of the masses and strengthening their confidence in victory. The Soviet Union and socialist countries have consistently opposed war. The Soviet Union's solemn and pioneering peace initiative to cease nuclear weapons testing and its insistence on convening top-level meetings to resolve international problems and improve international relations have made tremendous contributions to the people of all countries, and have made great positive contributions to the Arab nation's struggle against military treaties, war bases, enslavement policies, and wars that only bring misfortune and misery to the people.
    The solidarity and strength of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries give this year's May Day special significance. During the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries held the largest gathering in the history of the world labor movement, and made conclusions and discussions that are bound to consolidate the ranks of the proletarian movement and promote its development to a greater extent. The Soviet Union's launch of two artificial satellites into space also gives this year's May Day special significance. This event has stirred up a huge wave of joy and optimism in the hearts of billions of workers around the world, proving the outstanding vitality of the socialist system. The socialist system places science in the hands of the masses, so that science can serve construction, peace, and the realization of mankind's beautiful ideals. The socialist world has mastered the secrets of the most advanced science and technology, successfully manufactured intercontinental rockets, and is striding forward on the road of strength, prosperity, and progress, which is the greatest guarantee for the cause of peace, the freedom of the people of all countries, and the future of mankind. These successive great victories have indeed changed the balance of power, making the situation more favorable to socialism, the cause of peace, and the cause of liberation of the people of all countries. As a result of these victories, the attractiveness of socialism has been greatly enhanced, and the socialist system has become a stable system. The two greatest and most powerful countries in the world—the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—are at the forefront of this system. The great significance of this historical turning point is important and far-reaching for workers and all peoples, because it strengthens the power of the people of all countries to get rid of colonialism and enslaved life, and accelerates the final demise of the colonial system. Today, the Afro-Asian liberation movement is unstoppable, the unity of the Afro-Asian people is becoming increasingly consolidated, and the idea of peaceful coexistence is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The large-scale movement in Asia and Africa to support Algeria is the concrete embodiment of the ideas and resolutions of the Bandung Conference and the Cairo Conference, and a powerful illustration of the great unity of the Afro-Asian people in the anti-colonialist struggle. Colonialism is rapidly moving towards disintegration and demise, while the liberation movement is reporting frequent victories, and the socialist world is advancing on the road of strength and prosperity with giant strides. On the contrary, signs of economic crisis have already appeared in the heartland of the capitalist world. In the United States, new unemployed workers join the ranks of the unemployed, which already number more than five million every day. In other capitalist countries, signs of economic crisis are also beginning to emerge. This is the inevitable law of capital, which only brings misfortune, broken families, and slave life to workers.
    These facts make the sun of this year's May Day particularly radiant, illuminating the victorious confidence of billions of workers.
    Iraqi workers have every reason to harbor this victorious confidence, even though they are suffering persecution and living a miserable life—as a result of colonialism, monopoly groups, and foreign capital controlling the national economy. Iraqi workers are the first to encounter all the consequences caused by imperialist treaties such as the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine. They work in the stifling air of brutal police terror, with no right to organize trade unions, and even the minimum of democratic freedom is deprived. Despite the country's wealth, they face poverty, layoffs, meager wages, poor working conditions, and all kinds of political and social persecution.
    These disasters are becoming increasingly serious, especially after Iraq joined the Baghdad Pact. Persecution has deepened. Tyranny overshadows the country, the cost of living is soaring, and the working masses bear the burden of heavy taxes, which have been increased three times in a row. Nevertheless, they, along with other people, persist in their struggle to seize their minimum rights from the mouths of foreign beasts. (The representatives of foreign beasts in Iraq are oil monopoly groups and foreign companies and banks that control the economic lifeline of the country.) After decades of struggle, the working class and the workers have gained a common experience: that in order to seize a mouthful of bread, to obtain labor guarantees, and to realize their most basic rights, they must always clash with the colonialist policies imposed on their country, and with the special agent groups in their own country that protect the privileges of foreign capital and are obedient to the colonialists. Therefore, the struggle of the working class is often linked to the national struggle. The working class has become the vanguard of this struggle, and the vanguard of the working class is the inspirer and leader of this struggle.
    Every struggle experience in Iraq is inseparable from the heroic deeds of the working class. In 1917, when the British invaded Iraq, the worker Najim Bangaleh, who organized and led the anti-British riot in An Najaf, was hanged. During the Great Iraqi Revolution in 1920, the worker Hassan Al-Ahdal was the first martyr. After that, the workers' struggle continued to move forward vigorously. In 1920, workers in Basra organized the first major anti-British strike. In 1927, Baghdad railway workers held their first major strike. In 1929, the first railway union was established in Iraq, and the workers' desire to organize a trade union was realized. In 1929, the working people of Iraq organized industry unions under the leadership of trade unionist Muhammad Salih Al-Ghazaz. This union, together with some patriots, led a nationwide strike in 1931 to oppose the taxes imposed on the people after the signing of the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. It also led a major strike against the British Electric Power Company in 1933. In the same year, workers first organized the "Iraqi Workers' Federation".
    With the rise and development of class struggle and political struggle, the vanguard of the working class was formed, and the Iraqi Communist Party was established in 1934. Under the pressure of this struggle, the authorities dissolved and banned all organizations of workers, working people, and all walks of life. But the working class persisted in their life-and-death struggle. As a result of their struggle and the rise of the anti-fascist national struggle, Iraq promulgated the first labor law in 1936, which specifically stipulated working hours and some other guarantees. In early October 1936, Baghdad witnessed the largest demonstration of the working people, with about 50,000 participants, shouting slogans against the heinous fascists. In the winter of 1936, a series of strikes took place across the country, totaling 200,000 working days, including workers in railways, ports, oil, pumping stations, the Habbaniyah base, and cigarette factories. Before the end of World War II, the working class had established 19 legal trade unions through struggle. At the end of 1944, thousands of workers in the Shaiba British barracks organized another strike. Railway workers went on strike in May 1945.
    In 1946, the largest workers' strike organized by the Kirkuk oil workers took place. The authorities used machine guns to shoot workers, resulting in a massacre that aroused widespread anger among the people. In order to prepare to forcefully implement various imperialist plans, some trade unions and political parties were closed down, and terror was intensified. But the heroic uprising of the people in 1948 overthrew the Portsmouth Treaty, giving the workers' movement several months of revival—the working class grandly celebrated May Day. Prior to this, in February 1948, about 5,000 workers at the main oil station (K3) held a twenty-day strike. Oil pumping work was completely paralyzed during this period. But this strike was brutally suppressed. The workers were forced to walk 200 kilometers to Baghdad. They were brutally attacked along the way, and many were thrown into prison. In April of the same year, railway workers held a major strike. This strike was sabotaged by the British enterprise manager. The trade union was closed down, a large number of workers were fired, and the homes of others were destroyed. In 1950-1951, a series of heroic strikes took place in British military bases, in the port of Basra, in the Basra Electric Power Company, and in the Baghdad cigarette factory and textile factory. These strikes turned into massacres, with a large number of workers killed, trade unions closed, and trade union leaders arrested. In the face of this tyranny, the working class had no choice but to openly and forcibly organize trade unions, and they announced the establishment of the "Standing Council of Trade Unions". The authorities dissolved this council six months later and arrested the trade union leaders, throwing them into prison. In the winter of 1953, Basra oil workers held a comprehensive strike for several consecutive days. The government declared martial law, workers were shot, and a large number of people were thrown into prison. The workers participated in the uprisings of 1948, 1952 and 1956, they sacrificed many people, and thousands were thrown into prison. The working class realized that the peasants were their brothers in distress and their allies in the struggle. Trade unions and the working masses supported the struggle of their peasant brothers with strikes, demonstrations and protests, and supported their armed uprisings in the middle reaches of the Euphrates River, Amara, Kurdistan and other rural areas of Iraq.
    The Iraqi working class is forever faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalist solidarity. As long as they have the freedom to act, they always extend the hand of friendly solidarity to their worker brothers. The Iraqi working class supported the struggles of their Indonesian, Indian, Iranian, Bahraini, and Guatemalan brothers, supported the Egyptian brothers in the Battle of Ismailia in 1951, and supported the brothers in Saudi Arabia in 1953. The Iraqi working class joined the International Confederation of Arab Trade Unions. They blew up Iraqi oil pipelines during the invasion of Egypt. They participated in the World Workers' Conference, and they sent representatives to attend the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Whenever they gain some freedom, Iraqi workers always celebrate May Day. In 1948, workers held a May Day celebration in the largest cinema in Baghdad. They also held small-scale celebrations in parks and in the suburbs away from the surveillance of the authorities. Under the increasing pressure of terror, especially after the signing of the Baghdad Pact, and with the deprivation of all freedom, the trade union movement was forced to adopt a new program of action in order to continue the struggle cautiously and flexibly under extremely difficult conditions. Imperialism uses a large amount of money to carry out sabotage and bribery activities, to establish yellow trade unions, and to spread ethnic hatred among the workers, in order to undermine the unity of the workers' movement and lead the workers away from the path of national struggle. But these tricks were smashed by the working class's awareness, firm unity, and tenacious struggle. The Iraqi labor movement has not experienced any split in ten years. Under the leadership of its forward-looking vanguard, the workers' movement continues to work in close unity.
    The Iraqi working class, which is at the forefront of the national struggle, is deprived of the joy of celebrating May Day, but they are aware that no matter what they encounter, they should be faithful to their patriotic and internationalist traditions. They share the feelings of solidarity and friendship with the working people of the Arab world and the world on this festive occasion, and they look forward to a bright future with a hundredfold enthusiasm and optimism. At that time, Iraq will be freed from the control of colonialism, and at that time, the cause of peace, the liberation of the people, and the prosperity of socialism will surely be victorious.

    伊拉克劳动者向五一节致敬
    伊拉克共产党政治局委员　塔里克·穆罕默德
    伊拉克劳动者满怀信心和希望迎接五一节。社会主义国家在为全世界劳动者及其他人民群众的利益而进行的斗争中获致了辉煌的新的胜利。伊拉克，阿拉伯各国，全世界的亿万劳动者都把自己的希望寄托给日趋强大的以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营。劳动者把苏联和整个社会主义阵营看成是他们队伍的指路灯塔，是他们伟大希望的所在，是他们为解放为和平为美好生活而进行艰苦斗争的同盟者。苏联和整个强大的社会主义阵营在阿拉伯人反殖民主义的残酷斗争中同阿拉伯人站在一起，鼓舞了群众的斗志，加强了他们的胜利信心。苏联和社会主义各国一贯反对战争。苏联庄严地最先宣布停止核武器试验的和平创议和它坚持召开最高级会议以解决国际问题，改善国际关系等都为世界各国人民作出了巨大贡献，为阿拉伯民族反对军事条约、反对战争基地、反对奴役政策、反对只能给人民群众招致不幸与悲惨的战争等等斗争作出了巨大的积极的贡献。
    各国共产党和工人党的团结一致与强大使今年五一节具有特别重大的意义。在庆祝十月革命四十周年的时候，各国共产党与工人党作了世界工运史上规模最大的一次聚会，并且作出了势必在更大的程度上巩固无产阶级运动队伍并促其发展的结论与探讨。苏联发射两颗人造卫星上天，也使今年五一节具有特别重大的意义。这一事件，在全地球亿万劳动者的心上激起了欢欣与乐观的巨浪，证明了社会主义制度卓越的生命力。社会主义制度把科学放在群众的手中，使科学为建设为和平、为实现人类的美好理想而服务。社会主义世界掌握了最先进的科学技术的秘密，成功地制造了洲际火箭，在强大、繁荣、进步的大道上迈进，这就是和平事业、各国人民的自由事业和人类未来的最大的保证。这些接二连三的巨大胜利，确已改变了力量的对比，使形势对社会主义，对和平事业，对各国人民的解放事业更加有利。作为这些胜利的结果，社会主义的吸引力，在很大程度上增强了，社会主义制度已成为稳固的制度。世界上两个最伟大最强盛的国家——苏联和中华人民共和国走在这个制度的最前面。这个历史转折的伟大意义。对劳动者，对所有各国人民来说，是重要的，影响深远的。因为它加强了各国人民摆脱殖民主义与奴役生活的力量，加速了殖民主义制度的最后复亡。今天亚非解放运动势不可当，亚非人民团结日趋巩固，和平共处思想深入人心。亚非各地支援阿尔及利亚的规模巨大的运动是万隆会议和开罗会议的思想与决议的具体化，是亚非人民反殖民主义斗争大团结的有力说明。殖民主义迅速地走向瓦解与灭亡，而解放运动却捷报频传，社会主义世界以巨人的步子，在强盛繁荣的大道上迈进。与此相反，经济危机的征兆已经出现在资本主义世界的心脏地区，在美国，每天有新的失业工人加入为数已达五百余万的失业大军。在其他资本主义国家经济危机的征兆也开始露头。这是资本不可逃避的规律，它给劳动者带来的只是不幸、家破人亡与奴隶生活。
    这些事实，使得今年五一节的太阳格外光辉耀目，它照亮了亿万劳动者的胜利信心。
    伊拉克劳动者有一切理由怀抱这种胜利信心，虽则他们正遭受着迫害，过着悲惨的生活——殖民主义、垄断集团和外国资本控制国家经济的结果。伊拉克劳动者首当其冲地遭遇到由于巴格达条约、艾森豪威尔主义等帝国主义条约所引起的一切后果。他们在残暴的警察恐怖的窒息空气中工作，没有权利组织工会，甚至最低限度的民主自由都被剥夺了。尽管国家富饶，而他们却面临着贫困、解雇、微薄的工资、恶劣的劳动条件以及各式各样的政治和社会迫害。
    这些灾难并且在日趋严重，特别是在伊拉克参加巴格达条约以后。迫害加深了。横暴笼罩着全国，生活费用高涨，劳动群众担负着接连增加三次的重税。尽管如此，他们仍然和其他人民群众一起，坚持着斗争，从外国野兽的口中夺取他们最低限度的权利。（在伊拉克的外国野兽的代表，就是石油垄断集团以及掌握国家经济命脉的外国公司银行等。）工人阶级与劳动者经过几十年的斗争，他们得到了一条共同的经验，那就是，他们为了要夺取一口面包，为了取得劳动保证，为了实现他们最起码的权利，他们总是要和被强加于本国的殖民主义政策发生冲突，和保护外国资本特权、听命于殖民主义者的本国的特务集团发生冲突。因此，工人阶级的斗争，也就经常和民族斗争联系在一起。工人阶级也就成为这一斗争的先锋队，而工人阶级的先锋队又是这一斗争的鼓舞者与领导者。
    伊拉克的每个斗争经历，都是与工人阶级的英雄事迹分不开的。1917年英国入侵伊拉克，组织和领导安那加夫反英暴动的工人奈吉姆·班加勒被绞死了。1920年伊拉克大革命中，工人哈珊·艾赫勒斯是第一名烈士。其后，工人斗争继续昂扬前进。1920年，工人们在巴士拉组织首次反英大罢工。1927年，巴格达铁路工人举行首次大罢工。1929年，伊拉克第一次建立了铁路工会，工人要求组织工会的愿望得以实现。伊拉克劳动人民于1929年在工会工作者穆罕默德·萨利哈·干萨斯领导下组织了行业工会。这个工会协同一部分爱国分子在1931年领导了一次全国性的大罢工，反对1930年伊英条约签定后加于人民的捐税。它又在1933年领导了反对大英电汽公司的大罢工。同年，工人首次组织了“伊拉克工人联合会”。
    随着阶级斗争和政治斗争的高涨与开展，工人阶级的先锋队形成了，伊拉克共产党于1934年建立了。在这一斗争的压力下，当局解散、禁止了所有工人、劳动人民以及各行各业的组织。但是工人阶级坚持了他们的殊死斗争。由于他们的斗争，由于反法西斯全民斗争的高涨，1936年，伊拉克第一次颁布了劳动法，具体规定了工时和一些其他保证。1936年10月初，巴格达发生了一次规模最大的劳动人民的示威，参加者约五万人，示威群众高呼打倒万恶法西斯的口号。1936年冬，全国发生了一连串的罢工，共达二十万个劳动日，包括铁路、港口、石油、抽水站、哈巴尼亚基地和卷烟工厂的工人。第二次世界大战结束以前，工人阶级通过斗争建立了十九个合法工会。1944年末，沙比亚英国兵营中的几千工人又组织了一次罢工。1945年5月铁路工人罢工。
    1946年，发生了基尔库克石油工人组织的一次规模最大的工人罢工。当局使用机枪射击工人，因而酿成大屠杀，激起了人民群众的普遍的愤怒。为了准备强力执行帝国主义各项计划，一些工会与政党遭受封闭，恐怖加强了。但是1948年人民的英勇起义却推翻了朴茨茅斯条约，使工人运动有了好几个月的复苏空气——工人阶级盛大地庆祝了五一节。在此以前，1948年2月，主要石油站（K3）约有五千工人举行了为时二十天的罢工。石油抽送工作，在此期间完全陷于停顿。但是这一罢工遭到野蛮镇压。工人被迫步行二百公里向巴格达进发。他们在沿途遭受残酷攻击，很多人被投入监狱。同年4月，铁路工人举行大罢工。这次罢工被英国企业经理一手破坏。工会被查封，大批工人被开除，另一些人的住宅被捣毁。1950—1951年，在英国军事基地，在巴士拉港，在巴士拉电汽公司以及巴格达卷烟厂和纺织厂发生了一系列的英勇罢工。这些罢工转成了屠杀，大批工人死难，工会被封，工会领袖被捕。工人阶级在这一横暴面前，不得不公开强行组织工会，他们宣布成立了“工会常设理事会”。当局在六个月以后，解散了这个理事会并逮捕了工会领袖，把他们关入监狱。1953年冬天，巴士拉石油工人举行了全面的连续好几天的罢工。政府宣布戒严，工人被遭到枪击，大批的人被投进监狱。工人们参加了1948、1952和1956年的起义，他们牺牲了很多人，几千人被投入监狱。工人阶级认识到农民是他们的患难兄弟，是他们斗争中的同盟者。工会和劳动群众以罢工、示威和抗议支援农民兄弟的斗争，支援了他们在幼发拉底河中游、尔马拉、库尔德斯坦以及其他伊拉克农村的武装起义。
    伊拉克工人阶级永远忠实于无产阶级国际主义团结的原则。只要他们有行动的自由，他们总是向他们的工人兄弟伸出友爱团结的手。伊拉克工人阶级支持了他们印度尼西亚、印度、伊朗、巴林、危地马拉兄弟们的斗争，支持了1951年伊士美利亚战斗中的埃及兄弟，支持了1953年的沙特阿拉伯的兄弟。伊拉克工人阶级加入了阿拉伯工会国际联合会。他们在埃及被侵犯期间炸毁伊拉克的油管。他们参加了世界工人会议，他们曾派代表出席庆祝十月革命四十周年纪念大会。只要他们得到点自由，伊拉克工人总是要庆祝五一节的。1948年工人们曾在巴格达一家最大的影院中举行庆祝五一节的大会。他们还在公园中、在远离当局监视的城郊举行小规模的庆祝。在日趋严重的恐怖压力下，特别是在巴格达条约签定后，在一切自由都被剥夺的情况下，工会运动被迫采取新的行动纲领，以求在极端困难的条件下，得以谨慎灵活地继续斗争。帝国主义用大批金钱来进行捣乱、收买活动，建立黄色工会，在工人队伍中散布种族仇恨，借以破坏工运的团结和统一，使工人脱离民族斗争的道路。但是这些伎俩却被工人阶级的觉悟、坚决的团结和顽强的斗争所粉碎。伊拉克工运，十年以来，还没有发生过分裂。工人运动在它的勇往直前的先锋队的领导下，紧密团结，继续进行工作。
    走在民族斗争最前列的伊拉克工人阶级，虽然被剥夺了庆祝五一节的欢乐，但他们觉悟到不论在什么样的遭遇下，都应该忠实于他们的爱国主义与国际主义的传统。他们和阿拉伯世界以及全世界的劳动人民，在此佳节，同感团结友爱之情，他们以百倍的热情与乐观向往着光明灿烂的未来。在那时，伊拉克将摆脱殖民主义的掌握，在那时，和平事业、人民解放与社会主义的繁荣必将获得胜利。
