"That the old should be cared for, the strong employed, the young nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled all provided for" has been the ideal of the Chinese people for thousands of years. In the era when exploiters were in a ruling position, this could only be a fantasy. Today, when the people are masters of their own country, this has become a living reality. With the rapid recovery and development of production in the past few years, our country has basically eliminated unemployment, and the people's living standards have improved significantly. The Party and the state also pay great attention to people who have partially or completely lost their ability to work and have difficulties in life, giving them necessary material assistance. In particular, they have organized those among them who have not completely lost their ability to work to participate in production suitable to their circumstances. This not only gives them the possibility of further improving their lives but also gives them the opportunity to contribute to socialist construction. The achievements of Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, in this regard are a clear and vivid example. In this city, with the exception of a very few people who have completely lost their ability to work, the widowed, orphaned, and urban poor who rely on government subsidies and relief have all participated in production.

Starting with organizing production and serving production is a consistent policy of urban preferential treatment and relief work. Facts over the past few years have proved that this policy is in line with the Party's general policy of proceeding from 600 million people and mobilizing all positive factors to serve socialism. As everyone knows, birth, old age, sickness, and death are the natural laws of human life. At any time, there will be a portion of people who have lost all or part of their ability to work due to old age, illness, or disability. It is entirely appropriate for the state to provide these people with necessary material assistance. However, if they rely solely on government subsidies and relief without finding other ways out for this group of people, this will not only be a burden on the city in the long run, but they will also not be satisfied with their own situation as other people's lives continue to improve. If they are organized to engage in production that they can handle, they will not only be able to gradually support themselves but also create wealth for the country. This shows that in solving the livelihood problems of the urban poor and the elderly, widowed, sick, and disabled, adopting a policy of focusing on production supplemented by necessary relief is a positive policy. It is the fundamental way to enrich the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and the widowed and orphaned in cities who have difficulties in life. It is the fundamental measure for the Party and the state to properly arrange for this group of people.

The vast majority of people who rely on government relief for a long time are elderly, weak, or disabled, and they do not have the conditions to participate in the production of industrial and mining enterprises or work in government agencies. In this regard, they seem to be useless people who can only consume but not produce material wealth. However, even among these people, only a very few are completely unable to work. Most people still have varying degrees of ability to work. If they are organized to participate in production suitable to their circumstances, they will become useful people. Usefulness and uselessness can transform into each other under certain conditions. The useful can become useless, and the useless can become useful. In capitalist society, people and things that are originally useful can also become useless. In socialist society, people and things that are originally useless can also become useful. Many people still do not understand this dialectical way of observing problems. This is mainly because their thinking is somewhat rigid. They see this aspect of things but not that aspect, and thus conclude that urban welfare work can only provide relief and cannot organize production. The experience of Xuzhou and other cities tells us that organizing self-reliance through production is entirely possible under our superior social conditions and is the desire of the vast majority of urban poor and widowed and orphaned. Under the continuous education of the Party and the government, they generally understand that labor is glorious and not only do not want the government to support them for nothing, but also want to contribute to socialist construction. The key is whether we can organize production in a way that suits their characteristics, strengthen political leadership over them, and provide them with necessary economic assistance. As long as these conditions are met, social welfare production in various towns and cities will be developed, enabling the state to solve the livelihood problems of this group of people without spending money or spending very little money, and their lives will become better and better.

Some people also admit that self-reliance through production should be the main focus, but they have a fixed view on organizing production. They believe that since we are going to engage in production, it must be done in a decent manner, and thus they always want to keep up with large factories. As for small workshops and temporary production groups, they look down on them. Therefore, although some production units have been organized with government investment, and they have played a certain role in solving the livelihood problems of the urban poor and transforming vagrants, these production units are mostly relatively large, and many people with weak labor power and disabilities cannot participate, so their problems remain unsolved. This looks like a matter of method, but it hinders the implementation of policies.

The civil affairs department of Xuzhou City, based on the principles of adapting to people, time, and place, and making use of whatever is available, tried every means to make the most of all available people and things. In the social welfare production they organized, there is fixed production, as well as temporary and seasonal production; there is centralized production, as well as decentralized production; there is large-scale production, as well as small-scale production, and most of them are small-scale production; there is production using good materials, as well as production using waste materials, and most of them are production using waste materials. In various types of production, work is assigned according to each person's different situation. Those who can stand to produce stand to produce, and those who can sit to produce sit to produce, and so on. This creative work style, which is not bound by outdated rules and regulations and proceeds from reality in everything, is an important reason why social welfare production in Xuzhou City can develop vigorously.

Since organizing social welfare production is the only way to solve the livelihood difficulties of the urban poor and a necessary measure to transform negative factors into positive factors and turn consumption cities into production cities, this work should be placed on the important agenda of the Party committee. The Party's leading organs in various towns and cities should include organizing social welfare production in the urban construction plan, urge the civil affairs departments, and organize the forces of relevant departments to help them solve the difficulties and problems that can be solved, especially to strengthen their political and ideological leadership. All civil affairs cadres must understand that starting with production and serving production is the fundamental policy of urban preferential treatment and relief work, not a temporary expedient, and must be adhered to for a long time. Except for a few people who have completely lost their ability to work or who have temporary difficulties in life, who should still be given necessary subsidies and relief, all those who can participate in production should be organized into production in a planned way, transforming passive relief into active production. The Party committee should also help civil affairs cadres establish a clear mass line viewpoint and turn the organization of social welfare production into a mass action. All welfare production that is conducive to improving the lives of the masses and national construction should be allowed to be run by the masses, with the state providing necessary support and assistance. Under the leadership of the Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Xuzhou Municipal Civil Affairs Department did just that. They widely publicized the urban relief work policy of self-reliance through production to the masses and fully utilized the strength of the neighborhood committees. Many neighborhood committees have made organizing social welfare production their main task. It is appropriate to arrange the work of neighborhood committees in this way in areas where there are more urban poor. Because the livelihood difficulties of the masses are the main contradiction in the street work in such areas, grasping and solving this main contradiction can drive other street work.

"Everyone uses their talents, and everything is used to its fullest." This can only be achieved in a socialist society. And when this is achieved, it will make our country richer and stronger more quickly, and make our people live a happier and more fulfilling life. The Xuzhou Municipal Civil Affairs Department has done a very good job in making "everyone use their talents, and everything is used to its fullest." It should be greatly advanced in the future. The civil affairs departments in other towns and cities should learn from them, carry out revolutionary competition with them, and also make a great leap forward in organizing social welfare production. Everyone should make due contributions to accelerating socialist construction.

### 人尽其才　物尽其用

    人尽其才　物尽其用
    “老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”，是我国人民几千年来的理想。在剥削者居于统治地位的时代，这只能是一种幻想；在人民当家作主的今天，这才变成了活生生的现实。几年来随着生产的迅速恢复和发展，我们的国家已经基本上消灭了失业的现象，人民的生活水平有了显著的提高。对于部分或全部丧失劳动力和生活困难的人，党和国家也予以高度的关怀，给了他们必要的物质上的帮助，特别是组织他们中间还没有完全丧失劳动力的人，分别参加了适合于他们情况的生产。这样，不仅使他们有了进一步提高生活的可能，而且使他们同样有机会为社会主义建设贡献力量。江苏省徐州市在这一方面所达到的成就便是一个鲜明的生动的例证。这个城市除了极少数完全丧失劳动力的人以外，依靠政府补助和救济的鳏寡孤独和城市贫民已经全部参加了生产。
    从组织生产入手并为生产服务，是城市优抚救济工作一贯坚持的方针。几年来的事实证明了，这条方针是符合于党的一切从六亿人口出发和调动一切积极因素为社会主义服务的总方针的。人们都知道，生老病死是人类生活的自然法则，不论什么时候，都会有一部分人，因为老病残疾而全部或部分丧失劳动力。对于这些人，由国家在物质上给予必要的帮助，这是完全应该的；但是如果单纯依靠政府的补助和救济，不为这一部分人找别的出路，长期下去，这不仅对城市是一个包袱，而且在其他人的生活不断提高的情况下，他们也不会对自身的处境感到满意。如果把他们组织起来，进行他们能够胜任的生产，他们不仅能够逐步作到养活自己，而且还可以为国家创造财富。这就说明，在解决城市贫民和孤老病残者的生活问题上，采取以生产为主、辅以必要救济的方针，是一条积极的方针，是使城市中生活困难的烈属、军属和鳏寡孤独富裕起来的根本道路，是党和国家对这部分人加以妥善安排的根本措施。
    长期依靠政府救济的人，绝大多数是老弱残废者，没有条件参加工矿企业的生产和机关工作。就这一点来说，他们好像是无用的人，只能消费而不能生产物质财富。但是，就是在这些人中间，完全不能劳动的人也只是极少数，多数人还有不同程度的劳动能力，组织他们参加适合于他们情况的生产，他们就会变为有用的人。有用和无用在一定的条件下能够相互转化，有用变为无用，无用变为有用。在资本主义社会，本来是有用的人和物，也会变为无用的人和物；在社会主义社会，本来是无用的人和物，也会变为有用的人和物。这种辩证地观察问题的方法，还有许多人不懂得。这主要因为他们的思想多少有些僵化，看到事物的这个方面，就看不到事物的那个方面，因而在城市的福利工作上，得出了只能救济不能组织生产的结论。徐州和其他城市的经验告诉我们，组织起来进行生产自救，在我们优越的社会条件下是完全可能的，而且是绝大多数城市贫民和鳏寡孤独者的愿望。他们在党和政府的不断教育之下，一般都懂得劳动是光荣的，不仅不愿意让政府白白地养活自己，还想对社会主义建设有所贡献。问题的关键就在于能不能针对他们的特点，采取适合于他们的方式组织生产，在政治上加强对他们的领导，在经济上给予他们必要的援助。只要具备了这些条件，各个城镇的社会福利生产都会搞起来，使国家不花或只花很少的钱，就能够解决这部分人的生活问题，而且会使他们的生活过得愈来愈好。
    有些人虽然也承认应以生产自救为主，可是在组织生产上却有一套固定不变的看法。他们认为既然要搞生产，就必须搞得像个样子，因而总是想和大工厂看齐；至于小型作坊和临时性的生产小组，他们是看不起的。因此，虽然靠政府的投资组织起一些生产单位，在解决城市贫民的生活问题和改造游民等方面也起了一定的作用；但是因为这些生产单位多是比较大型的，许多劳力不强和有残疾的人不能参加，他们的问题就仍然没有解决。这看起来是方法问题，但却妨碍了方针政策的贯彻执行。
    徐州市的民政部门，本着因人、因时、因地制宜和因陋就简的原则，想尽一切办法，把可能利用的人和物都尽量利用了起来。在他们组织的社会福利生产中，有固定的生产，也有临时的和季节性的生产；有集中的生产，也有分散的生产；有大型的生产，也有小型的生产，而且多数是小型的生产；有用好料进行的生产，也有用废料废物进行的生产，而且多数是用废料废物进行的生产。在各类生产中，又根据各人不同的情况，分配他们的工作，能够站着生产的就站着生产，能够坐着生产的就坐着生产，等等。这种不为陈规旧章所束缚，一切从实际出发的创造性的工作作风，是徐州市的社会福利生产能够蓬勃发展起来的一个重要原因。
    既然组织社会福利生产，是解决城市贫民的生活困难的必由之路，又是化消极因素为积极因素，变消费城市为生产城市必须采取的措施，这个工作就应该提到党委的重要议事日程上来。各个城镇的党的领导机关，都应该把组织社会福利生产列入城市建设计划，督促民政部门，并组织有关部门的力量，帮助他们解决能够解决的困难和问题，特别是要加强对他们的政治思想领导。要使所有的民政干部都懂得，从生产入手并为生产服务，是城市优抚救济工作的根本方针，而不是一时的权宜之计，必须长期地坚持下去。除少数完全丧失劳动力或生活临时发生困难的人，仍然要给予他们必要的补助和救济以外，凡是能够参加生产的人，都应该有计划地把他们组织到生产中来，变消极的救济为积极的生产。党委还要帮助民政干部树立起明确的依靠群众的观点，把组织社会福利生产变成群众性的行动。凡是有利于改善群众的生活和国家建设的福利生产，都应该放手让群众来办，由国家给予必要的支持和帮助。在中共徐州市委的领导下，徐州市民政部门就是这样做的。他们广泛地向群众宣传了生产自救的城市救济工作方针，把居民委员会的力量充分运用了起来。许多居民委员会，都把组织社会福利生产作为主要工作。在城市贫民较多的地区，这样安排居民委员会的工作是适当的。因为群众的生活困难问题，是这类地区街道工作中的主要矛盾；抓住并解决了这个主要矛盾，就能够把街道的其他工作带动起来。
    “人尽其才，物尽其用”，这只有在社会主义社会才能做到；而做到了这一点，就会使我们的国家更快地富强起来，使我们的人民过着更加幸福美满的生活。徐州市民政部门在使“人尽其才，物尽其用”方面的工作，是作得相当出色的，今后还应当大大地前进一步。其他城镇的民政部门应向它们学习，同它们开展革命的竞赛，在组织社会福利生产上也来一个大跃进，大家都为加速社会主义建设作出应有的贡献。
