    The Fallen Gate
    In the yard outside the Guanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, there is a gate lying on the ground. Comrade Peng Junsheng, a salesman, pointed to it and told me a story.
    In June of last year, he washed a vest and left it to dry in the yard. In the blink of an eye, it was gone. He looked everywhere, but couldn't find it. The bell on his bicycle, which he had parked at the door, was twisted off and stolen. Just in front of their door, bicycle bells had been stolen five times. Some "customers" would take goods without paying, simply picking them up and walking away. A family member surnamed He once stole nearly half a kilogram of high-grade fruit candy. Persimmons, cigarette cartons, and soap boxes placed in the yard were often stolen. At that time, children were constantly climbing over the wall to steal things. There was no other way but to build the courtyard wall higher, add a fence outside the yard where goods were piled, and then add barbed wire. The gate would be tightly locked every night.
    After the struggle against the "Kingdom of Freedom," the order in Guanzhuang has greatly changed. Clothes left outside to dry, even for days and nights, are not touched. There have been no more instances of stolen goods. The entire social atmosphere has changed. The fence in the yard has lost its purpose, and the barbed wire has also been removed. The gate is no longer needed. Guanzhuang is now truly a place where "one doesn't pocket things found on the road."
    The Children Have Changed
    Every day, as the sun just begins to peek out, on the streets of Guanzhuang, people see groups of elementary school students happily going to school, or lining up to go to the lush wheat fields to help the farmers water the wheat. Or going to the cooperative or barber shop to clean the premises and engage in public service labor. Songs and laughter constantly fill the air.
    During the "Kingdom of Freedom" period, they were not like this at all, but had picked up many bad habits. They engaged in gang fights, disrupted public order, and jumped from the second floor. During dances held by the government, they would lie on the ground and lift the skirts of female comrades. When they saw male and female comrades walking together on the road, they would utter vulgarities. Some children even went to nearby villages to steal tomatoes and to the cadres' dormitories to steal toothpaste tubes. In school, many students were also lawless, creating disturbances in class and defecating in the teacher's drawer. Parents didn't care about their children, and teachers couldn't control them. In the "Kingdom of Freedom," these little rascals were allowed to run wild.
    Now that the "Kingdom of Freedom" has been overthrown, the children's bad habits have begun to change. Now they are no longer disruptors of public order, but have become assistants in many social welfare undertakings. These children often clean public places, organize hygiene propaganda teams, and promote the elimination of the four pests. They pool their pocket money to buy soap, handkerchiefs, and picture frames to comfort military dependents. They build walls for the school with their own hands. They help farmers dig reservoirs to fight drought. Some old farmers say: "With such good children, it doesn't matter if the heavens forget to rain." During the elimination of the four pests, one group of sixth-graders from the children's primary school caught thirty-six rats in one hour. In school, they no longer misbehave, but have become obedient to their teachers, abide by school discipline, and study hard.
    One of Six Hundred
    April 6th was a Sunday. A young couple from Guanzhuang took a bus into the city early in the morning, hoping to have a pleasant Sunday. But when they arrived in Beijing, the woman noticed that her watch was missing. This watch was a famous brand "Santos" calendar watch, bought with hard-earned savings of more than 160 yuan. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. Disappointed, the two hurried back from the city to look for it.
    It turned out that when she was queuing to board the bus, she had accidentally dropped her watch at the entrance of Guanzhuang. At that time, Yu Bingzhi, a driver from Guanzhuang, was maintaining order there. After the bus left, he suddenly saw a shiny watch on the ground. He picked it up and thought to himself: "It must have been dropped by someone who just got on the bus. Such a good watch, whoever loses it must be heartbroken!" While thinking, he ran to the head of the transportation team: "Quickly write it on the blackboard bulletin, and tell the comrade who lost the watch to come and claim it."
    Before long, the young couple who lost the watch ran back in a panic. Yu Bingzhi stepped forward to tell them where the watch was. The young couple really didn't know how to express their unexpected joy and heartfelt gratitude. Indeed, in Guanzhuang during the "Kingdom of Freedom" period when theft was rampant, who had ever heard of such a thing? But now, such incidents of "not pocketing things found on the road" are too common. In recent months, the police station has handled more than six hundred cases of "lost and found."

### 新的管庄  新的管庄人

    新的管庄  新的管庄人
    倒在地下的栅门
    管庄供销合作社外屋的院子里，有一扇倒在地下的栅门。营业员彭俊生同志指着它向我介绍了一段故事。
    去年6月份，他洗了一件背心，晾在院子里，一转眼，没有了，到处找也找不见。他搁在门口的自行车，铃铛被人扭走。光是他们门口，就先后被人偷走过五部自行车的车铃。有的“顾客”买货不给钱，拿起就走。一个姓何的职工家属，一次就偷了将近一斤高级水果糖。放在院子里的柿子、纸烟箱、肥皂箱经常被人偷走。当时不断有孩子爬墙头进来偷东西。没有办法，只好把院墙垒得高一些，在堆货的院子外面加一道栅栏，再加一道铁丝网，一到晚上就把栅门紧紧锁上。
    经过反“自由王国”的斗争，管庄的秩序大大改变了。晾在外面的衣服，就是搁上几天几夜，也没人动，再也没有过丢失商品的现象。整个社会风气改变了。院子里的那道栅栏，已失掉了它的作用，铁丝网也拉掉了。栅门也不要了。管庄，现在真是“路不拾遗”的好地方。
    孩子们变了
    每天，当太阳刚刚探出头来，在管庄的街道上，人们会看到三三五五的小学生高高兴兴地去上学，或者排着队伍到绿油油的麦地里去帮农民叔叔浇麦。或是到合作社、理发馆去打扫场地，进行公益劳动。歌声、笑声不断传来。
    在“自由王国”时期，他们可不是这个样子，而是沾染了很多坏习气。他们打群架，扰乱公共秩序，从二层楼上往下跳。在机关办舞会时，躺在地下撩女同志的裙子。在马路上看见男女同志在一起走路，就骂一些粗野的话。有些孩子还到附近庄园去偷西红柿，到干部宿舍里去偷牙膏管。在学校里，不少学生也是无法无天，在课堂上起哄，往老师抽屉里拉屎。家长不管自己的孩子，老师也管不了这些孩子。在“自由王国”中任凭这些小家伙们撒野。
      “自由王国”反掉了，孩子们的坏习气也开始改变了。现在他们不再是公共秩序的破坏者，而成为很多社会公益事业的助手了。这些小孩子经常打扫公共场所，组织讲卫生宣传队，宣传除四害。把零用钱凑起来，买肥皂、手帕、镜框去慰问军属。自己动手给学校砌墙。帮助农民挖水库，抗旱。有的农民老大爷说：有这样好的孩子，老天爷就是忘了下雨也没关系。在除四害时，子弟小学六年级一个组在一小时内就捉了三十六只老鼠。在学校里他们也不再胡作非为，而是变得听老师的话，遵守学校的纪律，努力学习了。
    六百多件中的一件
    4月6日是星期天，管庄有一对青年夫妇一早乘车进城，原想好好地过一个愉快的星期日，谁知到了北京，女的一看手表丢失了。这只手表是名牌“山度士”日历表，好容易积累了一百六十多元钱买来，越想越气恼，俩人很扫兴地从城里赶回来寻找。
    原来在她排队乘车时，不小心将手表掉在管庄的大门口。当时管庄的汽车司机尤秉智正在那里维持上车的秩序，汽车开走后，他突然看到地上有一只亮晶晶的手表，他拾起来心想：“一定是刚上车的同志丢掉的，这样一只好表，丢了谁不痛心！”他边想边跑到交通组长那里：“你赶快写在黑板报上吧，快叫丢表的同志来领。”
    时间不久，丢表的那对青年男女慌慌张张地跑回来，尤秉智迎上前去告诉了他们手表的下落。这对青年男女一时真不知道怎样表达自己意外的高兴和热烈的感激。确实是这样，在盗窃成风的“自由王国”时期的管庄，谁听过这样的事呢？可是，现在这种“路不拾遗”的事太普通了，最近几个月派出所办理的“失物招领”就有六百多件。（附图片）
