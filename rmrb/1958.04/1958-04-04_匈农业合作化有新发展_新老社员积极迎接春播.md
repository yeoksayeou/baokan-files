Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 3rd:  Hungary's agricultural production cooperatives, after a period of consolidation last year, have begun to see new developments this year. According to recent newspaper materials here, as of the end of February this year, forty-two new cooperatives have been established nationwide. The total number of cooperatives has reached 2,649.

The number of members in agricultural production cooperatives has increased from 125,000 at the end of last year to approximately 130,000, and the cultivated land area has increased from more than 1,184,000 holds to approximately 1,220,000 holds (each hold is equivalent to 8.55 Chinese mu). Most of the new members joining the cooperatives this year are poor farmers who withdrew from the cooperatives in 1953 and 1956 due to the destructive influence of revisionism and counter-revolution.

The Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government provides strong support to both new and old cooperatives, offering various preferential treatments and assistance in supplying seeds, livestock, chemical fertilizers, loans, and training cadres. Currently, the production enthusiasm of both new and old members is very high, and most of the arable land in many cooperatives has already been winter-ploughed before the start of spring. This spring, the rains came later than usual, and there have been several heavy snowfalls after the start of spring. However, the machine tractor stations are ensuring close cooperation with the production work of the cooperatives, giving priority to ploughing land for the cooperatives. Cooperative members are currently actively preparing for spring planting.

    匈农业合作化有新发展
    新老社员积极迎接春播
    据新华社布达佩斯3日电　匈牙利的农业生产合作社经过去年的一段巩固时期后，今年开始有了新发展。据这里最近的报纸材料，今年到2月底为止，全国已经新成立了四十二个合作社。合作社总数达到了二千六百四十九个。
    农业生产合作社的社员已经从去年年底的十二万五千人增加到约十三万人，耕地面积从一百一十八万四千多霍尔特增加到约一百二十二万霍尔特（每霍尔特合八点五五市亩）。今年新参加合作社的社员大部分是1953年和1956年因受修正主义和反革命破坏的影响而退社的贫苦农民。
    工农革命政府对新、老合作社都给予大力支持，在供应种子、牲畜、化学肥料、贷款和培养干部等方面给以各种优待和帮助。现在，新老社员的生产情绪都很高，很多社的大部分耕地在开春前已经进行了冬耕。今年春天雨水来得较迟，开春后又下了几场大雪，但是，机器拖拉机站保证密切配合合作社的生产工作，优先为合作社耕地。合作社社员们目前正在积极迎接春播。
