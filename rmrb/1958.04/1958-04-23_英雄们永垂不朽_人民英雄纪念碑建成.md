Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd – The Monument to the People's Heroes was completed today.

    The Monument to the People's Heroes was built to commemorate the people's heroes who sacrificed themselves in various struggles since 1840 to oppose internal and external enemies and to strive for national independence and the people's freedom and happiness. On September 30, 1949, the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference passed the decision to build this monument. That evening, Chairman Mao Zedong, together with all the CPPCC members, attended the groundbreaking ceremony. Chairman Mao wielded a shovel to lay the foundation stone for the monument. Construction officially began in August 1952. Nationally renowned architects, sculptors, artists, and the nation's best sculptors participated in the construction of the monument.

    This solemn and majestic monument is constructed of 17,000 blocks of granite and white marble. The base of the monument covers an area of more than 3,000 square meters, and the monument itself is 37.94 meters high, making it the largest monument in our country since ancient times.

    Today, the sculptors who have been working hard here since the beginning of the monument's construction completed the final touches on the ten large relief sculptures. Liu Kaiqu, the sculptor in charge of the monument's artistic design, and Jia Guoqing, the person in charge of the monument's construction site, carefully inspected the quality of each relief sculpture, railing, and other projects today. The quality of every project of the monument fully meets the requirements. Every relief sculpture is very clean and smooth, without any minor damage. The granite-paved platform and steps are as flat as glass. During the construction of the monument, there were no work-related injuries and no white marble was broken. On the south side of the monument, gardeners are watering the newly laid lawn. A few days ago, they planted two rows of pine trees on the east and west sides of the monument, extending for 200 meters.

    At night, the lights around the monument are all lit, and the five-colored electric lights dotted on the pine trees are like blooming colorful flowers. The sixteen spotlights installed on the four corners of the monument shine on the eight gilded characters "人民英雄永垂不朽" (The People's Heroes Are Immortal), shining with dazzling golden light.

    英雄们永垂不朽
    人民英雄纪念碑建成
    据新华社22日讯　人民英雄纪念碑在今天建成。
    人民英雄纪念碑是为了纪念公元1840年以来，为反对内外敌人、争取民族独立和人民自由幸福，在历次斗争中牺牲的人民英雄们而兴建的。1949年9月30日中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议通过了建立这座纪念碑的决定。当天傍晚，毛泽东主席偕同全体政协委员参加了奠基典礼。毛主席执锨铲土为纪念碑奠定了基石。1952年8月正式开始动工兴建。全国著名的建筑家、雕刻家、美术家和全国优秀的雕刻工人都参加了建碑工作。
    这座庄严巍峨的纪念碑，是用一万七千块花岗石和汉白玉石建成的，碑基占地三千多平方公尺，碑身高达三十七点九四公尺，是我国自古以来第一座最大的纪念碑。
    今天，从建碑开始就在这里艰苦劳动的雕刻工人们，在十块大浮雕上面作完了最后一遍修饰。负责领导纪念碑美术设计的雕刻家刘开渠和纪念碑工地负责人贾国卿，今天仔细地检查了每块浮雕、栏杆等工程的质量。纪念碑每一项工程的质量都完全符合要求。每一块浮雕都很细洁光滑，没有什么细微的损伤。用花岗石铺成的月台地面和台阶，像玻璃板一样平整。在建碑过程中，没有发生过一件工伤事故和刻坏过一块汉白玉。在纪念碑南面，园艺工人们正在新铺的草坪上浇水。前几天，他们刚把两排松树栽在碑的东、西两面，长达二百公尺。
    入夜，纪念碑周围的灯光齐明，点缀在松树上的五色电灯，像盛开的彩花。装在纪念碑四个角上的十六盏聚光灯，照射在“人民英雄永垂不朽”八个镏金大字上，闪着耀眼的金光。（附图片）
