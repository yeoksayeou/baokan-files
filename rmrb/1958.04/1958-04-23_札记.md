	On the Verge of Madness

	When U.S. Defense Secretary McElroy received reporters from "U.S. News & World Report" on the 21st, he alternately touted America's "deterrent power," saying that "in today's balance of power, we (referring to the United States) definitely have the advantage"; yet he also admitted that "the West's problems are more difficult than Russia's," and said "the United States has no anti-missile capability," therefore, attacking missiles "will all fly in (to the United States)." Although he tried his best to incite war hysteria, he could not help but admit, "The Russians... will not attack the United States."

	Although McElroy suffers from such severe war hysteria, he still patted his chest and said, "I sleep well at night," is this not just like a drunk person saying "I am not drunk"? From the incoherent remarks of this executor of the "brink of war" policy, it can be seen that he has reached the "verge of madness." This American Secretary of Defense is worthy of being the best successor to his predecessor, Forrestal, who committed suicide by jumping off a building due to war hysteria.

	Undying Ambitions

	The "New York Times" published an editorial on April 20 stating that Indonesia's "spirit of rebellion" has not been subdued. What these words mean is that although the rebel group is nearing its end, their "spirit" does not seem to have failed.

	These words of the "New York Times" are very similar to Ah Q's "spiritual victory method." However, it actually reflects a fact, that is: even if all the rebel groups supported by the United States are completely finished, the United States' aggression against Indonesia is still不死心 (bù sǐ xīn) - not reconciled to defeat/have undying ambitions.

    疯狂边缘
    美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊21日接见“美国新闻与世界报道”记者时，一会儿大肆吹嘘美国的“威慑力量”，说什么“在今天力量对比之下，肯定是我们（指美国）占优势”；一会儿却又承认，“西方的问题比俄国的问题较为困难”，并说“美国没有反导弹的能力”，因此，进攻的导弹“会全部飞进（美国）来”。他尽管竭尽全力煽动战争狂热，可是又不能不承认，“俄国人……是不会攻击美国的”。
    麦克艾罗伊虽然害着如此严重的战争歇斯底里症，但他还拍着胸脯说：“我晚上睡得很好”，这不正像喝醉了酒的人说“我没有喝醉”一样吗？从这位“战争边缘”政策执行人的语无伦次的谈话中，可以看出他已经到了“疯狂边缘”。这位美国的国防部长不愧是他的前任、因战争歇斯底里而跳楼自杀的福莱斯特尔最好的继承者。
    野心未死
    4月20日的“纽约时报”发表社论说，印度尼西亚的“叛乱精神”并未被压服。这些话的意思是说，叛乱集团虽然已临末日，但是他们的“精神”似乎并没有失败。
    “纽约时报”的这些话很像阿Q的“精神胜利法”。不过，它实际上倒是反映了一个事实，那就是：美国所支持的叛乱集团即使全部完蛋，美国对印度尼西亚的侵略仍然是不死心的。
