　　Birds of a Feather

　　The Indonesian rebel group's "Defense Minister," Harahap, told an AFP reporter that his "government" has the same goals as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. He also stated that if his "government" is successful, it will join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

　　Harahap did tell the truth. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool of American colonial aggression, and the Indonesian rebel group is exactly that; one of the "goals" of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is to subvert independent Asian countries, and rebel activity itself is precisely subversion. Birds of a feather flock together. It is only right and proper that the rebel group wants to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. However, it is wishful thinking for these rebels to join in the name of some "government"; they are just a bunch of running dogs of the American command of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

　　Stimulant

　　According to a report by UPI, West German Economics Minister Erhard, who had been in Washington for ten days to discuss the prospects and impact of the US economic recession with US officials, bankers and entrepreneurs, said that he believes the US economic recession is only a "temporary phenomenon" and that he believes that even if this industrial and commercial depression continues, it will not necessarily spread to other parts of the world.

　　UPI greatly appreciated Erhard's inaccurate statement, considering his remarks "an exciting thing for foreign countries, especially Europe."

　　The "New York Times" of the United States has recently admitted that economic recession is an incurable disease of the capitalist system. Since Eisenhower's "reassurance pill" has failed to improve America's chronic disease in any way, Erhard's "stimulant" is nothing more than a useless placebo for Western European countries that have already been infected.

    札记
    物以类聚
    印度尼西亚叛乱集团的“国防部长”哈拉哈普对法新社记者说，他的“政府”同东南亚条约组织具有同一目标。他并且表示，如果他的“政府”成功了，就要参加东南亚条约组织。
    哈拉哈普倒是说了一句真话。东南亚条约组织是美国殖民侵略的工具，印度尼西亚叛乱集团也正是这样；东南亚条约组织的“目标”之一是要颠覆独立的亚洲国家，而叛乱活动本身也正就是颠覆活动。物以类聚，叛乱集团要加入东南亚条约组织，这真是名正而又言顺。但是，这些叛乱分子要想用什么“政府”的名义加入，却是妄想；他们不过是东南亚条约组织的美国指挥部的一群走狗而已。
    兴奋剂
    据合众社报道，在华盛顿同美国的官员、银行家和企业家商谈了十天的西德经济部长艾哈德就美国经济衰退的前景和影响说，他认为美国的经济衰退只是一种“暂时现象”，他相信这次工商业萧条即使继续下去，也不一定会蔓延到世界其他地区。
    合众社很欣赏艾哈德的这种不符合事实的说法，认为他的谈话是“使外国、特别是欧洲感到兴奋的一件事情”。
    美国“纽约时报”最近已经承认经济衰退是资本主义制度不治之症。既然艾森豪威尔的“定心丸”未能使美国的痼疾有任何起色，艾哈德的“兴奋剂”对于已经受到传染的西欧国家也不过是一服毫无效用的假药罢了。
