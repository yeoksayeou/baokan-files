Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 2nd: The National On-Site Conference on Eliminating Sweet Potato Black Spot Disease was recently held in Suining County, Jiangsu Province.

The conference pointed out that in the past two years, various regions have adopted comprehensive measures focusing on the propagation of disease-free seed potatoes and cultivation of disease-free seedlings, and have carried out large-scale prevention and control work, achieving great success. According to incomplete statistics, the national prevention and control area last year was 18,410,000 mu. Suihe Township in Suining County, Jiangsu Province, created experience in eliminating sweet potato diseases through thorough prevention and control from 1951 to 1956. After the township's experience was promoted throughout the county in 1957, the entire county has basically eliminated the disease.

After detailed discussions, the representatives believed that to thoroughly eliminate sweet potato black spot disease, the following measures must be taken: First, implement comprehensive prevention and control measures focusing on the propagation of disease-free seeds and seedlings, carefully select disease-free seed potatoes, disinfect seed potatoes, promote warm bed or heated kang seedling cultivation, cutting and transplanting disease-free high cuttings, establish disease-free seed retention fields, use clean manure, and do a good job in harvesting and storage. Second, fully implement quarantine, establish mass quarantine organizations, with quarantine personnel in every commune, carry out "three checks" (diseased seeds not on beds, diseased seedlings not planted in the ground, diseased potatoes not stored in cellars), "three preventions" (prevent the introduction of diseased potatoes and seedlings, prevent the transfer of diseased potatoes and seedlings, prevent the circulation of diseased potatoes and seedlings within the territory), and protect newly developed areas and disease-free areas. Third, strengthen leadership, do a good job in publicity and training, with the secretary taking the lead, the whole party taking action, and dedicated personnel responsible at the county, township, and commune levels. Production teams should have fixed technical personnel, from seedling cultivation to cellar storage, with fixed quotas and contracted work. Extensively publicize the significance of eliminating sweet potato black spot disease, thoroughly carry out ideological mobilization, and achieve widespread awareness. Fourth, organize inspections and evaluations, focusing on seedling cultivation in the spring, planting in the summer, and harvesting and storage in the autumn and winter. Organize visits by region, carry out mass inspections and evaluations, and each province will hold one to two times each year. In February 1959, organize inter-provincial visits and evaluations in Henan Province, and through the competition to compare with and catch up with the advanced, strive to complete the three-year plan in two years.

The conference emphasized overall planning and immediate action. The first is to strengthen the management of warm bed seedling cultivation, strive to cultivate more disease-free and strong seedlings, and do a good job in seedling nurseries to ensure a large supply of disease-free sweet potato seedlings. In particular, this year, areas that want to achieve disease-free special zones and disease-free counties must ensure that every mu is planted with disease-free seedlings; second, various regions must establish disease-free seed retention bases at all levels, and every commune must establish disease-free seed retention fields. Generally, the seed retention field should reach 10%-15% of the planned cultivation area for the following year to prepare for breeding sufficient disease-free seed potatoes for the next year.

The conference believes that sweet potato is one of the main food crops for the masses in vast areas, and developing sweet potato is an important measure to achieve the agricultural development program's grain production increase target ahead of schedule. However, the harm of sweet potato black spot disease is still a serious problem. According to statistics from eight provinces, the loss of rotten sweet potatoes is about 9 billion jin every year. With the expansion of sweet potato cultivation area, some areas have not strictly implemented quarantine during the transfer of seedlings. Some newly developed areas have not adopted the method of cultivating disease-free seedlings locally and promoting disease-free seedlings and seed planting, but have introduced a large number of seedlings from diseased areas, which has expanded the diseased areas. At present, 19 provinces and cities across the country have varying degrees of disease occurrence. Therefore, to ensure the high yield and bumper harvest of sweet potatoes, we must thoroughly eliminate sweet potato black spot disease.

The plan of ten provinces to eliminate sweet potato black spot disease this year

Province	Number of Disease-Free Counties	Thorough Prevention and Control Area	Province	Number of Disease-Free Counties	Thorough Prevention and Control Area
Henan	30	16,000,000 mu	Shanxi	10	145,000 mu

### 繁殖无病种苗　全面实施检疫  彻底消灭甘薯黑斑病

    繁殖无病种苗　全面实施检疫
    彻底消灭甘薯黑斑病
    据新华社南京2日电　全国消灭甘薯黑斑病现场会议最近在江苏省睢宁县召开。
    会议指出，近两年来，各地采取以繁殖无病种薯、培育无病薯苗为主的综合措施，开展了大面积防治工作，并且取得很大成绩。去年全国防治面积据不完全统计有一千八百四十一万亩。江苏省睢宁县的睢河乡，从1951年至1956年的彻底防治，创造了消灭甘薯病害的经验。1957年在全县推广了这个乡的经验后，全县已达到基本消灭病害。
    代表们经过详细讨论，认为彻底消灭甘薯黑斑病，必须采取以下各项措施：一、贯彻以繁殖无病种、苗为主的综合防治措施，精选无病种薯，进行种薯消毒处理，推广温床或火炕育苗，扦插无病高剪苗，建立无病留种地，使用净粪，并做好收获贮藏工作。二、全面实施检疫，建立群众性的检疫组织，社社有检疫员，开展三查（病种不上床、病苗不下地、病薯不入窖），三防（防止引进病薯、病苗，防止调出病薯、病苗，防止病薯病苗境内流通），保护新发展区和无病区。三、加强领导，做好宣传训练，书记挂帅，全党动手，县、乡、社都有专人负责。生产队固定技术人员，从育苗到窖藏，定额包工。广泛宣传消灭甘薯黑斑病的意义，深入做好思想发动，达到家喻户晓。四、组织检查评比，春季抓育苗，夏季抓种田，秋冬抓收获贮藏。分片组织参观，开展群众性的检查评比，各省每年分别举行一至二次。1959年2月在河南省组织省际参观评比，通过比先进、赶先进的竞赛运动，争取三年规划，两年完成。
    会议强调全面规划，立即动手。首先是加强温床育苗管理，争取多培育无病壮苗，并搞好采苗圃，保证无病薯苗的大量供应。特别是今年要实现无病专区、无病县的地区，要保证亩亩棵棵栽植无病苗；其次，各地要层层建立无病留种基地，社社建立无病留种田，一般留种田应达到次年计划培植面积的10％—15％，为明年繁殖足够的无病种薯作好准备。
    会议认为，甘薯是广大地区群众的主要口粮之一，发展甘薯是提前实现农业发展纲要粮食增产指标的一项重要措施。但甘薯黑斑病的危害仍然是一个严重的问题。根据八省统计，每年烂薯损失约九十亿斤。随着甘薯栽培面积的扩大，有些地区在种苗调运时没有严格执行检疫。有些新发展区还没有采取就地培育无病苗、推广无病苗种地的办法，而是从病区大量引进种苗，这就使病区扩大。目前全国已有十九个省、市不同程度的发生病害，因此，要保证甘薯的丰产丰收，就必须彻底消灭甘薯黑斑病。
