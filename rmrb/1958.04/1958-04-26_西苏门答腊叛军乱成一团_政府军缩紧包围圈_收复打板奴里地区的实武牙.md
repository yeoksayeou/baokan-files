Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 25th: The Indonesian First Military District Information Office announced on Medan Radio on the evening of the 24th that government troops had recaptured Sibolga, an important city in the Padang Lawas area, on the morning of the 24th. The rebels there could not withstand the offensive of the government armed forces and abandoned many weapons while fleeing. Government troops are currently pursuing the remaining insurgents.

The Padang Lawas area is geographically connected to West Sumatra, where the rebels are entrenched. The government forces' continuous victories in the Padang Lawas area make it increasingly difficult for the Hussein rebel group to escape north to Padang Lawas and join the rebels led by Nainggolan there.

At the same time, government troops are narrowing the encirclement of the rebels in West Sumatra. Lieutenant Colonel Piengadi, Director of the Army Information Office, said on the evening of the 24th that Solok, Batu Sangkar, and Bukittinggi have become the main targets of the government offensive, and the rebels have lost contact with each other in many places.

Piengadi recently pointed out that rebel leaders had requested all rebels to concentrate in Bukittinggi on the radio, indicating that the rebel group and its army were in disarray. He said that they are running around everywhere, and the connection between them has been cut off.

It is reported that after the government troops recapture Sibolga, they will then attack Tarutung, northeast of Sibolga. It is said that the rebels led by Nainggolan and Sinta Pohan are entrenched there.

    西苏门答腊叛军乱成一团
    政府军缩紧包围圈
    收复打板奴里地区的实武牙
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚第一军区新闻处24日晚间在棉兰电台宣布，政府军在24日上午收复了打板奴里地区的重要城市实武牙。那里的叛军抵抗不住政府武装部队的进攻，并且在逃窜时丢下许多武器。政府军目前正在追击残余的叛乱分子。
    打板奴里地区在地理上同叛军盘踞的西苏门答腊相接。政府军在打板奴里地区不断获得的胜利，使得侯赛尼叛乱集团打算向北逃往打板奴里同那里的奈恩戈兰率领的叛军会合的企图越来越难实现了。
    与此同时，政府军正在缩小对西苏门答腊叛军的包围圈。陆军新闻处处长皮恩加迪中校在24日傍晚说，梭洛、巴株山卡和武吉丁宜已经成为政府军进攻的主要目标，叛军在许多地方彼此失去联系。
    皮恩加迪最近指出，叛军头目们曾经在电台上要求所有的叛军在武吉丁宜集中，这表明叛乱集团和它的军队已经乱成一团。他说，他们正在到处乱窜，他们之间的联系已经被切断了。
    有消息说，政府军在收复实武牙以后，将进而攻击实武牙东北的打鲁栋。据说，奈恩戈兰和辛塔·波汉率领的叛军盘踞在那里。
