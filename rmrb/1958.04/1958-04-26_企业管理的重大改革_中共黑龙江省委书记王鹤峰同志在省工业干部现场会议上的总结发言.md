This conference was very successful. At the meeting, five units, including the State-owned Qinghua Tool Factory, Jianhua Machinery Factory, Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, Northeast Third Engineering Company's First Engineering Department, and Songjiang Hardware Factory, introduced their experiences. These experiences each have their own characteristics. The Qinghua Tool Factory introduced experiences in three areas—cadres participating in labor, workers directly participating in management, and reforms in management operations. The factory's cadres participate in labor relatively universally, and the time spent participating in labor is also relatively long (workshop cadres all participate in labor for half a day every day), and they have already begun to gain some experience; although workers have only directly participated in management for a short time, the results have been great; combining cadres participating in labor and workers directly participating in management to carry out revolutionary transformations of management work is still an innovation in the entire province. The Jianhua Machinery Factory mainly introduced the experience of workers directly participating in management. They have been working on this issue for a longer time, and their spirit of deeply studying problems in the process of exploration is worthy of everyone's learning. At the same time, their ideological work is also relatively meticulous. The Northeast Third Engineering Company's First Engineering Department's experience of "three-izations" (cadres becoming workers, life becoming mass-oriented, labor becoming regularized) and "five-togethernesses" (cadres and workers eat together, live together, labor together, and entertain together, etc.) is also very prominent, demonstrating their leadership's great determination and the relatively thorough transformation of cadres' work style. The Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory introduced how they, based on the Central Committee's instructions on promoting the planting of experimental plots, came up with the experience of "two dragons," and how they later learned from the experience of workers directly participating in management at the Jianhua Machinery Factory. The Harbin Local State-owned Songjiang Hardware Factory mainly introduced the factory's experience of cadres following shifts to participate in labor and work. In short, the experiences everyone introduced are all very good and worthy of learning for all industrial enterprises in the province. At the same time, these experiences are all new and fundamental. If we earnestly promote these experiences, they will have extremely important significance for the current rectification—the Double-Anti movement and the Great Leap Forward in production—or for the improvement of all aspects of work in industrial enterprises in the future.

The three aspects of experience exchanged at this meeting—cadres participating in labor, workers directly participating in management, and reforms in management operations—are, in nature, all revolutionary measures belonging to fundamentally improving enterprise leadership and management, revolutions in enterprise leadership style and working methods, and major reforms in management work. Cadres participating in labor makes leaders worker-ized; workers directly participating in management means they are both producers and managers; implementing revolutionary transformations of management operations means thoroughly revising regulations and systems that restrict mass initiative and the development of productive forces. In terms of working methods, these are all the fast and good methods, the promoting methods, that Chairman Mao spoke of. Therefore, if these experiences are fully implemented in industrial enterprises, it can thoroughly overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism in leadership, fully implement the Party's mass line, greatly improve the leadership level and management level of enterprises, and powerfully promote the development of productive forces. If our various enterprises can implement well the two fundamental systems in enterprise leadership decided by the Central Committee—the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, and the workers' representative assembly system under the leadership of the Party committee; and at the same time, can truly apply the mass line working methods created in the rectification movement, such as great airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates, to regular work; and earnestly promote the three types of experience introduced at this meeting, and gradually come up with a set of mature methods, then in our industrial enterprises we will have: (1) strong Party leadership and political-ideological work; (2) a democratic centralism management system that combines high democracy and high centralization; (3) a systematic set of mass line working methods; and (4) a contingent of both red and expert cadres will be quickly cultivated. With these, the Party's policy of relying on the working class to run enterprises well and the mass line working methods can be fully implemented in enterprises, further resolving the unity of politics and technology. A "political situation in which there is both centralization and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of will and individual ease of mind and liveliness" will be realized.

Over the years, we have gained many experiences and lessons in solving the problem of enterprise leadership and management, but concentrated, the main one is this: No matter how many special characteristics industrial enterprises have, in the final analysis, in socialist enterprises, the most fundamental issue is still strengthening Party leadership and implementing the mass line. In other words, in industrial enterprises, just as we did in the past with revolution, practice once again proves that creatively applying Marxism (i.e., using the method of combining theory and practice) makes work go well. Conversely, adopting the dogmatic method of mechanically copying makes work not go well. We must firmly remember this lesson.

Through years of exploration, we have deeply realized the decisive role of the masses in socialist enterprises. No matter when, no matter what work, as long as we truly fully mobilize and rely on the masses, we can solve problems that leadership cannot solve, overcome difficulties in work, and create miracles in production and work. This is most clearly seen in the current rectification—the Double-Anti movement and the Great Leap Forward in production. May I ask: If it were not for resolutely mobilizing the masses, carrying out great airing of views, writing big-character posters, etc., according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, how could the various contradictions and problems in enterprises be exposed so thoroughly? If it were not for fully relying on the masses and adopting the mass line method to carry out rectification, how could the tens of thousands of opinions put forward by the masses in the airing of views be dealt with so quickly and appropriately? If it were not for fully mobilizing the masses politically and ideologically in the rectification movement, and raising the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the broad masses, how could there be such a production upsurge and a Great Leap Forward in production as there is now? All of this once again proves that the policy of relying on the working class to run enterprises well, put forward by the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, is completely correct. At the same time, this powerfully refutes the fact that in the past, in many enterprises, the practice of infinitely expanding management agencies, increasing non-production personnel, simply relying on systems and cards, simply relying on organizational discipline and heavy rewards and punishments, and not paying attention to raising mass consciousness and relying on mass enthusiasm, was wrong and did not conform to the Party's spirit of relying on the working class to run enterprises well.

Through rectification, we have gained a further understanding of the situation of internal contradictions in enterprises, the essence of the problems, and their root causes. In socialist enterprises, although the means of production are owned by the whole people, and the working class is the master of the enterprise, and the contradictions within the working class are non-antagonistic contradictions generated on the basis of fundamental unity of interests, contradictions do indeed still exist between productive forces and relations of production, and between the superstructure and the economic base. Within the working class, between advanced elements and backward elements, between people holding correct opinions and correct attitudes and people holding wrong opinions and wrong attitudes, between this part of the masses and that part of the masses, and between the working masses and the leaders of the enterprise, there are also various contradictions. At the same time, many of these contradictions are concentratedly manifested in the relationship between leaders and the masses, and the main aspect of the contradiction is the "three-isms" and right-leaning conservative thought in leadership; this is very clear from the tens of thousands of opinions put forward by the broad masses in the rectification—Double-Anti movement. Right-leaning conservative thought and the "three-isms" in leadership are manifested not only in the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines, but also in a series of issues such as leadership style, working methods, and management systems. Therefore, thoroughly exposing and criticizing right-leaning conservative thought and various wasteful conservative phenomena in enterprises through the rectification—Double-Anti movement, making a revolution in leadership style and working methods, and carrying out a revolutionary transformation of enterprise management work, will not only adjust internal contradictions in enterprises—contradictions between productive forces and relations of production, between the superstructure and the economic base, between leaders and the masses, and between this part of the masses and that part of the masses—but will also further implement the Party's policy of relying on the working class to run enterprises well, and the line of more, faster, better, and more economical, going all out, aiming high, and fundamentally changing the face of enterprises, powerfully promoting the development of productive forces, and realizing a comprehensive leap forward from leadership to the masses, from thought to production, will have extremely important significance. The three aspects of experience introduced by the Qinghua Tool Factory and other units precisely provide us with some directional and concrete methods for solving these problems. This is where the value of their experience lies.

Over the years, many cadres have not well resolved the issue of combining political work and economic work, and the issue of being both red and expert, in their understanding and work. Through rectification and cadres participating in labor, these issues have not only become clearer in understanding, but also gained some new experiences in practice. It should be pointed out that we have gained many experiences in the rectification movement regarding the issue of combining political work and economic work, such as the example of the whole Party doing political work, all cadres (including administrative management cadres and technical cadres at all levels) doing political work, and various forms of mass self-education, which can be said to be a great development in our enterprise political work. Regarding the issue of being both red and expert, although our experience is not yet much, because cadres have participated in labor in the rectification movement and have more thoroughly improved their work style, and technical personnel have greatly improved their political consciousness through the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, it can be said that we have begun to find a correct way to solve this problem. Doesn't the Central Committee's notice on promoting the planting of experimental plots clearly point out that planting experimental plots is a very good method to "enable cadres to embark on the road of being both red and expert and realize the unity of politics and technology"? Aren't many of our enterprises actively implementing this instruction from the Central Committee?

In short, in this rectification movement, some fundamental issues concerning enterprise leadership and management have been further resolved ideologically and practically. We have now gained a lot of new experience on how to rely on the working class to run enterprises well, and how to fully apply the mass line working methods in various tasks (including administrative management). We should earnestly study and summarize these experiences.

Now I will talk about three issues.

I. On the issue of workers directly participating in management

Can it be said that taking the production team as a unit and having the masses of workers in the team take charge of the management work through division of labor is a form of workers directly participating in management? Yes, because that's the way it is. It is different from the form of workers' representative assemblies that attracted employees to participate in management and supervise administration in the past. It is a further expansion of democracy in enterprise management, and it is a new form of workers directly participating in management. It has no contradiction with the form of the workers' representative assembly. This form is a creative development in implementing the mass line in enterprise management work, and it further establishes enterprise management work on a broad mass basis. This is an innovation that fundamentally improves enterprise management work. It is of great significance, and it is multifaceted. First, it can maximize the participation of the masses of workers in management, fully develop the enthusiasm of the masses in production and management, and greatly enhance their sense of ownership and collectivist thinking. Second, this is a fundamental measure to thoroughly overcome bureaucracy in enterprise management. At the same time, this is also a good form for cultivating the management ability of the masses of workers, which creates very favorable conditions for promoting cadres from workers in the future. Combining this method with cadres participating in labor is also of great significance for eliminating the contradiction between mental labor and physical labor, and eliminating the contradiction between leaders and the masses. One of the main sources of contradictions between enterprise leaders and the masses of workers is because they are in different positions in production. On the one hand, the masses of workers directly participate in production labor (mainly physical labor), and generally do not directly exercise management power; on the other hand, enterprise leaders directly exercise administrative power and generally do not participate in physical labor. This makes them each have limitations in understanding problems. Implementing the method of cadres participating in labor and workers directly participating in management can greatly eliminate these limitations on both sides, reasonably adjust the relationship between leaders and the masses, and between the masses of workers and each other, in production, thereby powerfully promoting the development of productive forces. Practice has proven that implementing workers directly participating in management has very good political and economic effects, and it is immediately effective. Some comrades say that implementing this method makes cadres happy, the masses welcome it, and production and work are easier to do. I think this statement is realistic and reasonable. Therefore, we must have sufficient understanding of the great significance of this experience. It should be affirmed that this experience is completely correct in direction, but because the time is very short, the specific methods are still very imperfect and immature, and many problems still need to be further studied and resolved in practice. Here, I will only give some opinions on a few issues raised in the discussion for your reference.

(1) What is the nature of the team? Is it the Party's, the trade union's, or the Communist Youth League's? It is none of these. It seems more appropriate to call it a mass production management team. Its nature is an administrative organization. Its relationship with the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League should be determined according to this nature. Therefore, it cannot replace the organizations of the Party, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League.

(2) The principle of team division should mainly be determined according to the characteristics and needs of production, and the convenience of the masses of workers in their work. That is to say, the size of the team should be based on being conducive to production, and at the same time, it must be considered that the masses of workers participate in production management work without leaving their jobs, and the working time can only be carried out in spare time and during production intervals. Therefore, each person's work tasks should not be too heavy, and the organizational level of workers directly participating in management should not be too many. I think it is enough to have the production team level.

(3) The issue of the production of the team leader should be to adopt a method combining mass elections and appointment by higher authorities. This reflects the principle of democratic centralism. At the same time, the higher-level administration can also transfer and, if necessary, directly appoint the team leader according to work needs.

(4) The issue of the division of labor within the team should be appropriately carried out according to each person's characteristics and expertise, and must be based on the principle of voluntariness. We should try to ensure that every worker has a job. We should pay attention to not having one person take on too much work, and the time spent on management work in spare time should not be too long, so as not to affect the masses' spare time learning and participation in Party and mass organizations' activities.

How to promote this experience?

First, we must do a good job of ideological work and eliminate various ideological concerns and misunderstandings of cadres and the masses. Judging from the experience of the Qinghua Tool Factory and the Jianhua Machinery Factory, the main problem in the minds of cadres is not believing in the masses, thinking that workers are "crude" and cannot manage well, fearing that they will mess things up, and fearing that it will affect production, etc. We should educate them to believe in the majority of the masses, and explain to them that the current masses of workers are different from the past. Not only have they greatly improved politically and technically, but the vast majority of the masses have also improved their cultural level. Moreover, the work of workers directly participating in the management of the production team is not too complicated, and each person is assigned only a few tasks, and they are all the most familiar and specific things they do every day. In addition, after business reform, many procedures and systems are not as complicated and cumbersome as in the past. So, what can't the masses of workers do? Haven't the results of the trials in several units fully proved this? Even if some workers don't know how to do management work temporarily, won't they quickly learn it? Some ideological problems that need to be solved among the masses of workers mainly include fear of making mistakes, fear of not being able to bear responsibility, fear of trouble, and fear of affecting piece-rate wages, etc. Therefore, we must strengthen their education as masters of the country. Experience has proven that the vast majority of the masses are very active and enthusiastic about this matter, thinking that this is the greatest trust the leadership has in them, and that this is how they can better act as masters of the country. Therefore, they are very serious and responsible in their work, and they are also more active in production. At the same time, with this, mass self-criticism and mutual criticism are widely carried out, and the atmosphere of mass mutual supervision is greatly strengthened.

Second, we must give workers some necessary business training at the beginning, and constantly pay attention to cultivating and improving their management ability. At the same time, we must reform the business procedures and systems accordingly, and improve leadership methods to adapt to the situation of workers directly participating in management.

Third, we must strengthen the leadership of Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in this work, summarize experiences in a timely manner, and study and solve various problems in the promotion process, so that it can be gradually completed and improved. If it is thought that this is an administrative organization, and the masses are very active, it seems that Party and mass organizations don't have much to do. Ideological work and organizational work can be relaxed. This is not right. How the Party and the trade union can do their own work in this work should also be studied, and gradually some experience should be found.

II. On the issue of cadres participating in labor

In industrial enterprises, leading cadres participating in labor and cultivating "experimental plots" have the same significance as cultivating experimental plots in agriculture in terms of improving leadership style, working methods, and making cadres "both red and expert." This was stated by the Provincial Party Committee in its approval and transmittal of the report from the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory on learning from "cultivating experimental plots." According to the Central Committee's instructions on leading cadres participating in labor and the Central Committee's instructions on promoting the planting of experimental plots, cadres in industrial, capital construction, forestry industry, and transportation enterprises in our province are now participating in labor relatively universally, and have begun to explore some experience. The relevant experiences in this regard introduced by the Qinghua Tool Factory, the First Engineering Department of the Northeast Third Engineering Company, the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and the Songjiang Hardware Factory at this meeting all illustrate this point. Judging only from these experiences (in fact, there are more experiences in this area in the province as a whole), it can be clearly seen how much significance it has for improving leadership style, working methods, and closely linking with the masses, as long as we earnestly implement the Central Committee's instructions on cadres participating in labor and cultivating experimental plots. However, upon strict inspection, there are still many problems in this work now. These are mainly:

(1) In many units, leading cadres' participation in production is not well combined with leading production, and the purpose of participating in labor is not clear. There is somewhat of a flavor of participating in production for the sake of participating in production. Therefore, after they participate in production, they still cannot integrate with the masses, and they still do not have much help in leading production. This shows that they have not yet well understood the significance of the Central Committee's instructions on this issue. At the same time, after the leading cadres of some units participate in production, although they have played some role in improving the leadership of production operations, Party and mass work is still the same. They (including the Party committee secretary) are not good at (or even do not pay attention to) closely combining the improvement of the leadership of economic work with the improvement of the leadership of political work from participating in production.

(2) We have not yet come up with a set of methods on how to determine the different requirements, forms, and methods of participating in labor according to the characteristics of cadres and the needs of production. The Qinghua Tool Factory and other units have explored some relevant experience in this regard, but this problem has not been completely resolved. The appropriate resolution of this problem is not only a question of whether cadres' participation in labor can be correctly and fully utilized, but also a key issue of whether cadres' participation in labor can be regularized and institutionalized. In many of our enterprises, cadres' participation in labor is not truly regularized and institutionalized. In addition to other reasons, it cannot be said that this is also one of the important reasons.

(3) How to enable cadres to embark on the road of being "both red and expert" in a planned way through participating in labor, that is to say, how to combine the planning of cadres participating in labor with the formulation of their own plans for being "both red and expert" (including learning political theory and business technology), has not yet been well resolved. Of course, this problem is also closely related to the second problem.

In addition, some enterprise leaders have not yet participated in labor until now, and this phenomenon should be quickly overcome.

Based on the above situation, how to further implement the Central Committee's instructions on this issue, and how to push the work of cadres participating in labor a step forward? I think that in addition to continuing to solve the ideological problems of cadres, the key is to solve the above three problems.

Regarding the issue of how to determine the different requirements, forms, and methods of participating in labor according to the characteristics of cadres and the needs of production, can it be done in principle like this, please consider. First, regarding the main leading cadres of enterprises. Their participation in production must first proceed from the purpose of leading production well. Therefore, the forms and methods of their participation in labor should be determined according to this premise. The units participating in labor can be fixed or not fixed, but generally should not be too many; the time of participation must generally be one and a half to two and a half days per week. If the time of participation is too long, it may not be better for production and work. Second, it is best for leading cadres to absorb some relevant technical personnel and Party and mass cadres to participate together when participating in labor and form a team (some units are doing this now). This may be better for solving problems and combining political work and economic work. Second, regarding technical personnel. Their participation in labor should generally be based on the principles of how to further combine technology with labor and how to better serve production, not only proceeding from labor training, but also first proceeding from improving the leadership of technology and business to determine the time, form, and method of participating in labor. Third, in addition to the above two types of people, other off-the-job personnel participate in labor mainly for labor training, which is similar in meaning to cadres being sent down to a certain extent, but the time of participation in labor is different.

III. On the issue of business reform

In the rectification movement, various enterprises generally made some improvements to management regulations and systems, and procedures, but none of them were as thorough as the Qinghua Tool Factory. Their approach is a revolutionary approach, a way to solve problems fundamentally. The main features of their business reform are:

(1) Business reform is carried out in conjunction with cadres participating in labor and workers directly participating in management. On the one hand, in order to overcome bureaucracy and subjectivism (mainly dogmatism) in leadership and management, cadres participated in labor and began to reform regulations and systems; on the other hand, workers directly participated in management, laying the foundation for business reform and cooperating with cadres participating in labor to fundamentally overcome bureaucracy in management. The three are organically linked and promote each other at the same time. The three are all products of the rectification - Double-Anti movement, and their common foundation is that, after the rectification, the leadership style has been thoroughly transformed, and the political consciousness of the broad masses of employees and technical personnel has been greatly improved. Without these, especially the thorough transformation of leadership style, it would be difficult for all three to be produced, and it would be difficult to promote them smoothly even if they were produced.

(2) After the business reform, the enterprise management work further implemented the policy of facing production and serving production, and business and production, technology and labor are further integrated.

(3) Business reform also fully embodies the spirit of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and facilitating the masses. This can be clearly seen from their bold reduction of businesses, simplification of reports, improvement of systems, decentralization of power, simplification of procedures, changing material collection and money collection to material delivery and money delivery, as well as the implementation of business concatenation and further streamlining of institutions. Is it simply relying on cumbersome formalistic rules and regulations to card people? Or is it to resolutely and thoroughly revise all unreasonable rules and regulations based on the principle of fully developing the enthusiasm of the broad masses and developing productive forces? It seems that they have solved this problem ideologically and practically.

Because the factory's business reform is carried out in accordance with the above policies and principles, this approach is not only warmly welcomed by cadres and the masses, but also the work effect is also very significant. Naturally, because the time for this reform is still very short, coupled with the fact that the business is very large and involves a wide range of areas, there are of course still many problems, and many problems need to be further studied and tested by practice. However, in any case, we believe that the direction of their reform is completely correct. We actively support them in doing this, and we hope that all enterprises in the province will study and learn from their experience. In the promotion process, it should be noted that when revising the relevant rules and regulations stipulated by higher authorities, it must be reported to the higher authorities for approval in advance before taking action, and some systems must be promoted after being tried out.

The comrades attending our meeting attach great importance to the three aspects of experience introduced at this meeting, and are prepared to actively and quickly promote them; the seventy-nine enterprises participating in the meeting have put forward a proposal to the industrial and transportation enterprises of the province to resolutely implement this meeting, and the prefectural committee and the county committees directly under the county have also put forward challenges to carry out mutual friendship competitions. All this shows the success of our meeting and fully reflects the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the comrades attending the meeting. Now the question is how to correctly combine the promotion of these three aspects of experience with the current rectification - Double-Anti movement and the Great Leap Forward in production, that is to say, to make appropriate overall arrangements for them. At the same time, the promotion of these experiences must be carried out realistically in accordance with the specific conditions of the region and the unit, and it is necessary to prevent mechanical copying. Everyone should not only learn from it, but also develop and improve it, because although these experiences are all correct in direction, in practice, there are still many problems that need to be further studied and resolved. At the same time, each enterprise has its own specific circumstances, and relying solely on copying other people's things cannot completely solve the problem, and may even make mistakes. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention to this. Second, as I have said before, these three experiences are all products of the rectification movement, and rectification is their root and their common foundation. Therefore, in order to promote them well, we must first insist on carrying out the rectification to the end, and we will never stop until we have won a complete victory. Specifically, at present, we must deepen and thoroughly carry out the Double-Anti movement, and closely combine the Double-Anti with the Double-Comparison - comparing the advanced, comparing more, faster, better, and more economical, and closely combine the ideological Great Leap Forward with the production Great Leap Forward; it is necessary to closely combine the thorough improvement of leadership style and working methods, the resolute implementation of business reform, the improvement of rules and regulations, and the strengthening of socialist education for the broad masses, the full mobilization of the masses, the active participation in enterprise management, the play of their enthusiasm and creativity in production and work, and the wide upsurge of a high tide of technological innovation. We must launch a province-wide, city-wide, county-wide, and all-industrial, capital construction, forestry industry, and transportation enterprise-wide, from leadership to the masses, a widespread and comprehensive upsurge of comparing the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. See who's rectification - Double-Anti movement is deep and thorough, see who's production leap forward is fast, and see who's technological innovation is good, and the formulation and implementation of the leap forward measures are good. We must not only compare revolutionary enthusiasm, but also compare leadership art - to improve leadership style and working methods. We must use the promotion of the three experiences of this meeting, that is, using the revolutionary spirit to improve leadership style, working methods, and management systems as the "big watermelon" of the current rectification, and take technological innovation as the main content of further carrying out the advanced producer movement. We must take the improvement and enhancement of the leadership level of enterprises as a central link to promote all work, and through the resolution of these fundamental problems, we can ensure that all work is done well and that the production leap forward is done well.

The Provincial Party Committee plans to hold a meeting in May and June to inspect and summarize the experience exchange meeting on the implementation of this meeting, which is also a competition meeting for the leadership art of the whole province. I hope everyone will go all out, and in order to welcome the evaluation meeting of the whole province, launch a fighting revolutionary competition between regions and regions, and between enterprises and enterprises!

    企业管理的重大改革
    中共黑龙江省委书记王鹤峰同志在省工业干部现场会议上的总结发言
    这次会议开得很好。在会上有国营庆华工具厂、建华机械厂、哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂、东北第三工程公司第一工程处和松江五金厂等五个单位介绍了经验。这些经验各有其特点。庆华工具厂介绍了三个方面的经验——干部参加劳动、工人直接参加管理和管理业务的改革。这个厂的干部参加劳动比较普遍，参加劳动时间也比较长（车间干部都是每日半天劳动），已开始取得了一些经验；工人直接参加管理，虽然时间还很短，但收效很大；结合干部参加劳动和工人直接参加管理对管理工作实行革命的改造，在全省还是一种创举。建华机械厂主要介绍了工人直接参加管理的经验。他们在这个问题上搞的时间较长，他们经过了摸索，在摸索过程中深入钻研问题的精神，值得大家学习。同时，他们的思想工作，也作得比较细致。东北第三工程公司第一工程处所介绍的“三化”（干部工人化、生活群众化、劳动经常化）、“五同”（干部和工人同吃、同住、同劳动、同娱乐等）的经验也很突出，表现了他们领导上决心很大，干部工作作风转变得比较彻底。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂是介绍他们怎样根据中央关于推行种试验田的指示，搞出了“两条龙”的经验，以后，他们又怎样学习了建华机械厂工人直接参加管理的经验。哈尔滨地方国营松江五金厂主要是介绍了该厂干部跟班参加劳动和工作的经验。总之，大家介绍的这些经验都很好，都值得全省所有工业企业来学习。同时，这些经验都是一些新的、带有根本性的经验。如果我们认真推行了这些经验，无论对当前的整风——双反运动和生产大跃进，或对今后工业企业中各方面工作的改进，都有极其重要的意义。
    在这次会上交流的三个方面的经验——干部参加劳动、工人直接参加管理和管理业务的改革——，从性质上讲，都是属于从根本上改进企业领导和管理的一些革命性的措施，是企业领导作风和工作方法上的革命，是管理工作上的重大改革。干部参加劳动，使领导人员工人化；工人直接参加管理、是生产者又是管理者；管理业务实行革命性的改造，彻底修改那些限制群众积极性和生产力发展的规章制度。这些，从工作方法上讲，都是毛主席所讲的那种又快又好的方法、促进的方法。因此，在工业企业中，如果完全推行这些经验，那就可以彻底克服领导上的官僚主义、主观主义，充分贯彻党的群众路线，大大提高企业的领导水平和管理水平，有力地促进生产力的发展。如果我们各个企业对中央所决定的企业领导上的两个根本制度——党委领导下的厂长负责制、党委领导下的职工代表大会制——都能贯彻好；同时又能把整风中所创造出来的大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论等群众路线的工作方法，真正运用到经常工作中去；再认真推行这次会上所介绍的三种经验，逐步搞出一套成熟的办法，那么，在我们工业企业里就：（一）有了坚强的党的领导和政治思想工作；（二）有了高度民主和高度集中相结合的民主集中制的管理制度；（三）有了系统的一套群众路线的工作方法；（四）一批又红又专的干部队伍很快就会培养出来。有了这样几条，那么，在企业中就能充分贯彻党的依靠工人阶级办好企业的方针和群众路线的工作方法，进一步解决政治和技术的统一。一个“又有集中又有民主的，又有纪律又有自由的，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面”，就将实现。
    几年以来，我们在解决企业领导和管理这个问题上所得到的经验教训是不少的，但集中起来，主要是一条：这就是不管工业企业具有多少特殊性，归根结底，在社会主义企业中，最根本的问题还是加强党的领导和贯彻群众路线。换句话说，在工业企业中，如同我们过去搞革命一样，实践再一次证明：创造性地运用马克思主义（即用理论和实践结合的办法），工作就搞得好。反之，采取生搬硬套的教条主义的办法，工作就搞不好。这种教训，我们必须牢牢记住。
    经过几年以来的摸索，我们深深地体会到，在社会主义企业中群众的决定性的作用。不管任何时候，不管什么工作，只要我们真正的充分发动和依靠了群众，就能解决领导上解决不了的问题，克服工作上的困难，创造出生产上和工作上的奇迹。这一点从这次整风——双反运动和生产大跃进中看得最为明显。试问：如果不是根据党中央和毛主席的指示，放手发动群众，进行大放大鸣、出大字报等，企业中的各种矛盾和问题怎么能够揭发的这样彻底？如果不是充分依靠群众、采取群众路线的方法进行整改，那么，群众在鸣放中所提出的多少万条意见，如何能够得到这样迅速的适当的处理？如果不是在整风中从政治上和思想上充分发动了群众，提高了广大群众的政治觉悟和生产积极性，又怎么能够出现现在这样的生产高潮和生产大跃进？这一切再一次证明了党的七届二中全会所提出的依靠工人阶级办好企业的方针是完全正确的。同时，这也有力地反证了：过去有个时期在不少企业中，无限制地扩大管理机构、增加非生产人员，单纯依靠制度卡、单纯依靠组织纪律和重赏重罚，而不注意提高群众觉悟和依靠群众的积极性的作法是不对的，是不符合党的依靠工人阶级办好企业的精神的。
    通过整风，使我们对企业内部矛盾的情况、问题的实质及其根源，有了进一步的认识。在社会主义企业中，虽然生产资料是全民所有制，工人阶级是企业的主人，工人阶级内部的矛盾是在根本利益一致基础上产生的非对抗性的矛盾，但是在生产力和生产关系之间，在上层建筑和经济基础之间，矛盾的确还是存在的。在工人阶级内部，在先进分子和落后分子之间，在抱着正确意见正确态度的人们和抱着错误意见错误态度的人们之间，在这一部分群众和那一部分群众之间，在工人群众和企业的领导者之间也都存在着各种各样的矛盾。同时，这些矛盾，很多又都集中地表现在领导和群众的关系上，而且矛盾的主要方面是领导上的“三个主义”和右倾保守思想；这从整风——双反运动中广大群众所提出的多少万条意见来看就很清楚。领导上的右倾保守思想和“三个主义”，不仅表现在贯彻执行党的方针政策上，而且表现在领导作风、工作方法和管理制度等一系列的问题上。因此，通过整风——双反把企业中的右倾保守思想和各种浪费保守现象彻底加以揭发、批判，从领导作风和工作方法上来一个革命，对企业管理工作进行一次革命的改造，那就不仅对调整企业内部的矛盾——在生产力和生产关系之间、上层建筑和经济基础之间、领导和群众之间，以及这部分群众和那部分群众之间的矛盾，而且对进一步贯彻执行党的依靠工人阶级办好企业的方针，和多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游的路线，从根本上改变企业面貌，有力地促进生产力的发展，从领导到群众、从思想到生产实现一个全面的跃进，都有十分重大的意义。庆华工具厂等单位所介绍的三个方面的经验，恰恰给我们解决这些问题提供了一些方向性的具体的作法。它们的经验之所以可贵，正在于此。
    几年以来，很多干部在认识上和工作上没有很好解决的关于政治工作与经济工作的结合问题和又红又专的问题。经过整风、干部参加劳动，这些问题不仅在认识上更加明确了，在作法上也取得了一些新的经验。应该指出，关于政治工作和经济工作结合的问题，在整风中我们取得的经验是不少的，像全党作政治工作、全体干部（包括各级行政管理干部和技术干部在内）作政治工作的例子，像各种各样的群众自我教育的形式等，可以说都是我们企业政治工作上一种很大的发展。关于又红又专问题，虽然我们的经验还不多，但是，由于在整风中干部参加了劳动，比较彻底地改进了作风，技职人员经过了整风和反右派斗争，政治觉悟有了很大的提高，因此，也可以说对这一问题，我们已开始找到了一种正确解决的门路。中央关于推行种试验田的通知，不是明确指出种试验田就是“使干部走上‘又红又专’的道路，实现政治和技术的统一”一种很好的方法么？我们很多企业不是都正在积极地贯彻中央这个指示么？
    总之，这次整风，关于企业领导和管理上的一些根本性的问题，都从思想上和工作上进一步得到了解决。如何依靠工人阶级办好企业，如何在各种工作（包括行政管理在内）中充分运用群众路线的工作方法，我们现在已经取得不少新的经验。我们应该认真研究和总结这些经验。
    下面我就三个问题讲一下。
    一、关于工人直接参加管理问题
    以生产小组为单位，把组内管理工作由工人群众分工负责，这是否可以说是工人直接参加管理的一种形式呢？可以。因为事实就是这样。它同过去吸引职工群众参加管理和监督行政的职工代表大会的形式有所不同，它是企业管理上的民主进一步的扩大，它是工人群众直接参加管理的一种新的形式。它和职工代表大会的形式毫无矛盾。这种形式是企业管理工作上贯彻群众路线的一种创造性的发展，它使企业管理工作进一步建立在广大群众基础之上。这是从根本上改进企业管理工作的一种创举。意义很大，而且是多方面的。首先它可以最大限度地吸引工人群众参加管理，充分发扬群众在生产上和管理上的积极性，大大地增强他们的主人翁责任感和集体主义的思想，其次，这是彻底克服企业管理上官僚主义的根本性的措施；同时，这也是培养工人群众管理能力的一种很好的形式，这样就为今后从工人中提拔干部创造了非常有利的条件。这个办法和干部参加劳动结合起来，对消除脑力劳动与体力劳动的矛盾，消除领导与群众之间的矛盾也有很大的意义。企业领导者和工人群众之间矛盾的主要来源之一，就是因为他们在生产中所处的地位不同。一方面，工人群众直接参加生产劳动（主要是体力劳动），一般地不直接行使管理权力；另一方面，企业领导者直接行使行政权力而一般地不参加体力劳动，这就使他们两方面在认识问题上各有局限性。实行干部参加劳动和工人直接参加管理的办法，就可以大大地消除他们两方面的这种局限性，合理地调整在生产中领导与群众、以及工人群众相互之间的关系，从而有力地促进生产力的发展。实践证明：实行工人直接参加管理，无论政治上或经济上效果都很好，而且是立竿见影的。有同志讲：实行这个办法，干部高兴，群众欢迎，生产和工作都好搞了。这种讲法，我认为是合乎实际的、有道理的。因此，对于这一经验的重大意义，必须要有足够的认识。应该肯定，这个经验在方向上是完全正确的，但是由于时间很短，在具体作法上现在还很不完善、不成熟，很多问题还需要在实践中进一步加以研究和解决。这里我仅就讨论中提出的几个问题讲点意见，提供大家参考。
    （一）小组的性质是什么？是党的，工会的，共青团的？都不是。看来叫作群众性的生产管理小组比较适当。它的性质是一种行政组织。它和党、工会、共青团的关系要根据这种性质来决定。因此，它不能代替党、工会和共青团的组织。
    （二）小组划分的原则，主要应根据生产的特点和需要，以及工人群众工作的便利来决定，这就是说，小组划分的大或小，要从有利于生产出发，同时，还必须考虑到工人群众是在不脱产的情况下参加生产管理工作，而工作的时间只能在业余和生产间隙来进行。因此，每个人的工作任务不能过重，工人直接参加管理的组织层次也不应太多，我看，有生产小组这一层就行了。
      （三）组长的产生问题，应该是采取群众选举和上级委任相结合的办法。这样就体现了民主集中制的原则，同时，根据工作需要上级行政还可以调动，必要时也可以直接委派。
      （四）小组的分工问题，应该根据每个人的特点和专长来适当地进行分工，并且必须以自愿为原则，要尽量使每个工人群众都有工作，要注意不要使一个人担负工作过多、业余作管理工作的时间也不要太长，以免影响群众业余学习和参加党群组织的活动。
    如何来推广这一经验？
    首先，要作好思想工作，消除干部和群众的各种思想顾虑和错误认识。从庆华工具厂、建华机械厂的经验来看，干部思想上的问题，主要是不相信群众，认为工人是“大老粗”，管不好，怕搞乱了，怕影响生产等。应该教育他们相信群众的大多数，并向他们讲清现在的工人群众和过去不一样了，不仅是在政治上、技术上有了很大的提高，绝大多数群众就是文化程度也有了提高，而且工人群众直接参加生产小组的管理，工作并不太复杂，每个人分工的事情也不太多，又都是他们自己每天所作的最熟悉的具体事情，加上经过业务改革，许多手续制度也不像过去那样复杂繁琐了。那么，工人群众有什么搞不了的呢？几个单位试行的结果不也完全证明了这一点么？就是暂时有些工人群众对管理工作还有不会作，不是很快就学会了么？在工人群众中所要解决的一些思想问题，主要是怕出错，怕负不了责任，怕麻烦和怕影响计件工资等。因此，必须加强对他们主人翁教育。经验证明：绝大多数群众对这个事情都很积极、热情，认为这才是领导上对他们最大的信任，这才是他们更好地作了主人翁，因而他们对工作非常认真负责，在生产上也更加积极了。同时这样一搞，群众性的自我批评和相互批评广泛地开展起来了，群众相互之间监督的气氛大大地加强了。
    其次，对工人群众开始要作一些必要的业务训练，并不断地注意培养提高他们的管理能力。同时，要相应地改革业务上的手续制度，改进领导方法，以适应工人群众直接参加管理的情况。
    第三，要加强党政工团对这一工作的领导，及时总结经验，研究和解决推行中的各种问题，使之逐步完整和提高。如果认为这是一种行政组织，群众又都很积极，党群组织好像就没有多少事情了。思想工作和组织工作就可以放松了。这是不对的。党和工会在这个工作上如何做好自己的工作，也应该加以研究，并逐渐摸出点经验。
  二、关于干部参加劳动问题
    在工业企业中，领导干部参加劳动，搞“试验田”，在改进领导作风、工作方法和使干部
  “又红又专”等方面，和在农业上种试验田有相同的意义，这是省委在批转哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂关于学习“种试验田”的报告中就讲了的。我省工业、基本建设、森林工业和交通运输企业根据中央关于领导干部参加劳动的指示和中央推行种试验田的指示，干部参加劳动，现在已经比较普遍，并已开始摸索了一些经验。这次会上庆华工具厂、东北第三工程公司一处、哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂和松江五金厂等单位所介绍的有关这方面的经验，都说明了这一点。仅就这些经验来看（实际上就全省讲这方面的经验还不只这些），也明显可以看出：只要我们认真贯彻中央关于干部参加劳动和种试验田的指示，对改进领导作风、工作方法和密切联系群众，有着多么巨大的意义。但是，严格检查起来，在这个工作上，现在问题还不少，这主要是：
      （一）不少单位领导干部参加生产没有很好地和领导生产结合起来，对参加劳动的目的性不明确。多少有些为参加生产而参加生产的味道。因此，他们参加生产以后，仍然和群众不能打成一片，仍然对生产上的领导没有多大帮助，这就说明他们还没有很好地领会中央关于这个问题指示的意义。同时，有些单位领导干部参加生产后，对改进生产业务的领导虽起了一些作用，可是，党群工作仍是老样，他们（包括党委书记在内）不善于（甚至不注意）从参加生产中，把改进经济工作的领导与改进政治工作的领导密切结合起来。
      （二）如何根据干部的特点和生产上的需要来确定参加劳动的不同要求、形式和方法，现在我们还没有摸出一套。庆华工具厂等单位摸索了一些有关这方面的经验，但这个问题还没有完全解决。而这个问题的适当解决，不仅是一个能否正确地充分地发挥干部参加劳动的作用问题，而且是一个能否使干部参加劳动经常化、制度化的关键问题。我们很多企业，干部参加劳动没有真正经常化、制度化，除了其他原因之外，不能不说这也是其中重要原因之一。
      （三）如何通过干部参加劳动使他们有计划地走上“又红又专”的道路，也就是说，如何把干部参加劳动的规划和制订他们自己“又红又专”的规划（包括学习政治理论和业务技术）结合起来，也还没有很好解决。当然，这个问题和第二个问题也有密切的联系。
    此外，有些企业领导干部直到现在还没有参加劳动，这种现象应该迅速克服。
    根据上述情况，如何进一步贯彻中央有关这个问题的指示，如何把干部参加劳动的工作向前推进一步，我认为，除了继续解决干部思想上的问题以外，关键是要解决以上三个问题。
    关于如何根据干部的特点和生产上的需要来确定参加劳动的不同要求、形式和方法问题，原则上可否这样，请大家考虑。第一，关于企业主要领导干部。他们参加生产，首先必须从领导好生产的目的出发，因此，他们参加劳动的形式和方法均应根据这一前提来决定。参加劳动的单位可以固定，也可以不固定，但一般不宜太多；参加的时间一般每周必须有一个半天到两个半天，参加的时间太长了对生产和工作也不一定更好。其次，领导干部参加劳动时最好能吸收一些有关技术人员和党群干部共同参加，组成一套班子（有些单位现在就是这样作的），这样对解决问题和政治工作与经济工作的结合，可能更好一些。第二，关于技职人员。他们参加劳动一般应根据技术如何进一步和劳动相结合，管理工作如何更好地为生产服务的原则，不仅从劳动锻炼出发，而且首先要从改进技术和业务的领导出发，来决定参加劳动的时间、形式和办法。第三，除了以上两种人以外，其他有些脱产人员参加劳动主要是为了进行劳动锻炼，在一定程度上和干部下放有相同的意义，只是参加劳动的时间有所不同而已。
    三、关于业务改革问题
    在整风运动中，各个企业对管理上的规章制度、办事手续等，一般都有一些改进，但都没有像庆华工具厂改进得彻底。他们这种作法是一种革命的作法，从根本上解决问题的办法。他们业务改革的主要特点是：
      （一）业务改革是和干部参加劳动和工人直接参加管理结合进行的。一方面为了克服领导和管理上的官僚主义、主观主义（主要是教条主义）干部参加了劳动，并对规章制度开始进行了改革；另一方面工人直接参加了管理，为业务改革打下了基础，配合干部参加劳动，从根本上克服了管理上的官僚主义。三者有机地联系着，同时又互相起着促进的作用。三者都是整风——双反运动的产物，它们的共同基础是，因为经过整风，领导作风有了彻底的转变，广大职工和技职人员政治觉悟有了很大的提高。如果没有这些，尤其是领导作风彻底转变这一条，三个东西都难以产生出来，就是产生出来，要想顺利推行也很困难。
    （二）经过业务改革企业管理工作进一步贯彻了面向生产、为生产服务的方针，业务和生产、技术和劳动进一步结合起来了。
    （三）业务改革还充分地体现了相信群众、依靠群众和便利群众的精神。这从他们大胆地减少业务、精简表报、改进制度、权力下放、简化办事手续、把领料领钱改为送料送钱的办法，以及实行业务串连和还要考虑进一步精简机构等方面，就看的很清楚。是单纯依靠繁琐的形式主义的规章制度来卡人呢？还是根据充分发挥广大群众积极性和发展生产力的原则来坚决彻底地修改一切不合理的规章制度呢？看来他们在思想上和作法上已经解决了这个问题。
    正因为该厂的业务改革是根据以上方针和原则进行的，所以这种作法不仅受到干部和群众的热烈欢迎，而且工作效果也很显著。自然，由于这种改革进行的时间还很短，加上业务性很大，牵涉的面很广，其中问题当然还不少，很多问题还须进一步研究和经过实践的考验。不过，不管怎样，我们认为，他们这种改革的方向是完全正确的。我们积极支持他们这样干，并且希望全省各个企业都来研究和学习他们的经验。在推行中，要注意在修改上级规定的有关规章制度时，必须事前报请上级批准，然后再行动，有些制度还须经过试行后才能推广。
    我们这次会上所介绍的三个方面的经验，到会同志都很重视，都准备积极地迅速地加以推广；参加会议的七十九个企业向全省工业和交通运输企业提出了坚决贯彻这次会议的倡议，地委和直属县委也都提出了开展相互友谊比赛的挑战，这一切都表现了我们这次会议的成功，也充分地反映了到会同志高度的革命干劲。现在问题是如何把推广这三个方面的经验和当前整风——双反运动与生产大跃进正确地结合起来，这就是说，对它们要作适当地全面安排。同时，推行这些经验必须根据本地区、本单位的具体情况，实事求是的去进行，要防止生搬硬套。大家不仅要学习它，而且要发展和完善它，因为这些经验虽然在方向上都是正确的，但在作法上，还有不少问题需要进一步研究和解决。同时各企业有各企业的具体情况，单靠搬用别人的东西，不仅不能完全解决问题，甚至可能要犯错误。此点，希望大家加以注意。其次，前面我已讲过，这三个经验都是整风的产物，整风是它们的根、是它们共同的基础。因此，为了很好地推广它们，首先就必须坚持把整风进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。具体地讲，目前就是必须把双反运动搞深搞透，要把双反和双比——比先进、比多快好省密切结合起来，把思想上的大跃进和生产上的大跃进密切结合起来；要把领导上的彻底改进作风、改进工作方法，坚决实行业务改革、改进规章制度和加强对广大群众的社会主义教育，充分发动群众，积极参加企业管理，发挥他们在生产中和工作中的积极性、创造性，广泛地掀起一个革新技术的高潮密切结合起来。我们要在全省范围内，在各市、县、在所有工业、基本建设、森林工业和交通运输企业中，从领导到群众，广泛地全面地掀起一个比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮。看谁整风——双反运动搞的深透，看谁生产跃进的快，看谁革新技术搞的好，跃进措施制订与贯彻的好。我们不仅要比革命干劲，而且要比领导艺术——以改进领导作风和工作方法。我们要把推行这次会议的三个经验，即用革命的精神改进领导作风、工作方法和管理制度作为当前整改的“大西瓜”，要把技术革新作为进一步开展先进生产者运动的主要内容。要把改进与提高企业的领导水平作为推动一切工作的一个中心环节，通过这些根本问题的解决，保证搞好一切工作、保证搞好生产大跃进。
    省委准备在五、六月份召开一次检查和总结贯彻这次会议的经验交流会，这也是全省一次比领导艺术的评比会。希望大家鼓足干劲，为迎接全省的评比会，在地区和地区、企业和企业间展开一个战斗的革命的比赛！
