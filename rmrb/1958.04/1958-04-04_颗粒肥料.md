Granular fertilizer comes in two categories: one is granular chemical fertilizer directly manufactured by chemical fertilizer factories, such as granular superphosphate of lime, granular ammonium nitrate, granular urea, granular calcium cyanamide, etc. This type of granular fertilizer does not contain organic matter and is called "inorganic granular fertilizer." The other type is granular fertilizer made by mixing powdered superphosphate of lime with organic fertilizers (such as manure, peat, etc.). This type of granular fertilizer contains both organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer. This "organic-inorganic granular fertilizer" is what we usually call granular fertilizer.

Making nitrogenous chemical fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate into granular form can improve the fertilizer's physical properties, reduce hygroscopicity, facilitate mechanical fertilization and concentrated fertilization, and also avoid losses from scattering when applying powdered fertilizers. Making superphosphate of lime into granular form, in addition to improving its physical properties and facilitating storage and application, has the more important effect of increasing fertilizer efficiency.

Why is this? Because superphosphate of lime is a chemical phosphate fertilizer, and it is usually in powder form. The phosphate fertilizer it contains can dissolve in water, and crops can directly absorb and utilize it, resulting in a fast fertilizer effect. However, superphosphate of lime has a characteristic: when it comes into contact with substances such as iron, aluminum, and lime in the soil, the water-soluble phosphate it contains will be synthesized into water-insoluble compounds such as iron phosphate, aluminum phosphate, and tricalcium phosphate. This situation is called soil fixation. As a result, crops cannot absorb and utilize those phosphate fertilizer components, and the fertilizer effect of superphosphate of lime is greatly reduced. According to experiments, when powdered superphosphate of lime is directly applied, the utilization rate of the phosphate it contains is only 15%-30%, and the remaining 70%-85% of the phosphate is fixed by the soil and cannot play its role. From this, it can be seen that the more extensive and closer the contact between superphosphate of lime and the soil, the more opportunities there will be for its phosphate to be fixed by the soil. If superphosphate of lime is applied in granular form, the area of contact between it and the soil can be greatly reduced, thereby reducing the chance of phosphate being fixed by the soil and enabling it to better exert its fertilizer effect.

In this light, granular fertilizer is not a new type of fertilizer, but a method of treating and using fertilizer.

In recent years, various regions have actively manufactured and promoted granular fertilizer. This is a good phenomenon. However, due to the indiscriminate use of various raw materials in some areas to make granular fertilizer, a lot of waste has also been caused. For example, in some areas, garbage containing a large amount of furnace ash (coal slag, plant ash), soil (pond mud, river mud, street soil, etc.), and superphosphate of lime and ammonium sulfate are mixed to make granular fertilizer. Furnace ash is an alkaline substance. When ammonium sulfate encounters alkaline substances, the nitrogen fertilizer it contains will volatilize. Furnace ash contains lime, and the soil contains iron, aluminum, and also lime. When superphosphate of lime is mixed with them, it turns into water-insoluble compounds.

There are also places that use soybean cake, distiller's grains, etc., as raw materials for granular fertilizer. Soybean cake and distiller's grains are both good livestock feed. It is more economical to feed them to livestock first, and then use the livestock manure to fertilize the land. In terms of fertilizer effect, there is no difference between making these things into granules and not making them into granules.

There are also some places that use bone meal, bird droppings, Thomas phosphate, phosphate rock powder, etc., to replace superphosphate of lime in making granular fertilizer. This is unnecessary. Although these fertilizers are all phosphate fertilizers, their properties are different from those of superphosphate of lime. The phosphate they contain cannot dissolve in water. When applied to the ground, they need to rely on the action of acids in the soil to dissolve their phosphate before crops can absorb and utilize them. If they are made into granular fertilizer, reducing the contact surface with the soil, the fertilizer components will not decompose quickly, and the generation of fertilizer effect will be even slower.

In short, the manufacture of granular fertilizer should have a clear purpose and scientific basis. Indiscriminate use of raw materials and blind manufacture will not only not bring any benefits, but will also cause waste of labor and materials. (Deng Xiliu)

### 颗粒肥料

    颗粒肥料
    颗粒肥料有两类：一类是化学肥料工厂直接制造出来的颗粒状化学肥料，如粒状过磷酸钙、粒状硝酸铵、粒状尿素、粒状石灰氮等。这类颗粒肥料不含有有机质，叫做“无机颗粒肥料”。另一类是利用粉状过磷酸钙和有机质肥料（如厩肥、泥炭等）混合调制成颗粒状的肥料。这类颗粒肥料既含有有机肥料，也含有无机肥料。这种“有机无机颗粒肥料”，就是我们通常说的颗粒肥料。
    硝酸铵等氮素化学肥料制成颗粒状，可以改善肥料的物理性状，减少吸湿性，便于用机械施肥和集中施肥，也可以避免施用粉状肥料的时候飞散的损失。把过磷酸钙制成颗粒状，除了可以改善它的物理性状，便于贮存和施用以外，更重要的作用是提高肥效。
    这是为什么呢？因为过磷酸钙是一种化学磷肥，通常它是粉末状的，所含的磷酸肥分能够溶解于水，作物可以直接吸收利用，肥效快。但是，过磷酸钙有一种特性，当它与土壤中的铁、铝和石灰等物质接触的时候，它所含的水溶性磷酸就会化合成磷酸铁、磷酸铝、磷酸三钙等不溶于水的化合物。这种情形叫做土壤的固定作用。这样一来，作物就不能吸收利用那些磷酸肥分，过磷酸钙的肥效也就大为降低。根据试验证明，粉状过磷酸钙直接撒施时，它所含磷酸的利用率只有15％—30％，其余70％—85％的磷酸被土壤固定起来，不能发挥效用。由此可见，过磷酸钙与土壤接触的范围越广泛、越密切，它的磷酸被土壤固定的机会就会越多。如果把过磷酸钙制成粒状施用，可以大大减少它和土壤接触的范围，从而也就减少磷酸被土壤固定的机会，使它能更好地发挥肥效。
    这样看来，颗粒肥料并不是一项新的肥料，而是一种处理和使用肥料的方法。
    近年来，各地积极制造、推广颗粒肥料。这是一种好的现象。但是由于一些地区乱用各种原料滥制颗粒肥料，也造成不少浪费。例如有些地区，利用含有大量炉灰（煤炭渣、草木灰）的垃圾、泥土（塘泥、河泥、街道土等）和过磷酸钙、硫酸铵混合制成颗粒肥料。炉灰是碱性物质，硫酸铵遇到碱性物质，它所含的氮素肥分就会挥发掉；炉灰中含有石灰，泥土中有铁、铝，也有石灰，过磷酸钙和它们混在一起，变成不溶于水的化合物。
    还有的地方用豆饼、酒糟等做颗粒肥料的原料。豆饼、酒槽等都是很好的牲畜饲料，用它先喂牲畜，然后用牲畜的粪便肥地就更经济。在肥效上，把这些东西制成颗粒和不制成颗粒也没有什么区别。
    也有些地方，它们用骨粉、鸟
  粪、汤马斯磷肥、磷矿粉等，代替过磷酸钙制造颗粒肥料。这是不必要的。这些肥料虽然都是磷肥，但它们的性质却与过磷酸钙不同。它们所含的磷酸不能在水里溶解，施到地里，要靠土壤中的酸类的作用，使它们的磷酸溶解以后，才能供作物吸收利用。如果把它们制成颗粒肥料，减少了与土壤的接触面，肥分反而不能很快的分解，肥效的产生也将更加迟慢。
    总之，制造颗粒肥料应当有明确的目的和科学的依据，滥用原料，盲目地制造，不但得不到什么好处，而且会造成劳力和物质的浪费。　（邓锡鎏）
