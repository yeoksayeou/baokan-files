    Tools for Promoting Spring Plowing

    During the spring plowing production, Xiao Shaocheng, the deputy director of the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangling County, Hubei Province, resisted timely early planting. No matter how much people told him, he did not believe in the benefits of early planting. The members understood his concerns, so they posted a big-character poster that read: "Director Xiao's work is not bad, but he has four fears when it comes to planting seedlings: First, he fears that the seedlings will be planted too early, and there will be no empty fields to transplant them; second, he fears that the seedlings will be planted too early, and the cold weather will freeze them to death; third, he fears that the seedlings will be planted too early, and there will be no water in the ponds to tread; fourth, he fears that the seedlings will be planted too early, and the manpower and animal power will not be able to keep up. I say your thinking is 'ri da xia' (meaning incorrect), and I hope you will change it quickly!" As soon as this big-character poster was posted, the members launched a debate and calculated the costs and benefits of Xiao Shaocheng's four fears: The cooperative planned to plant 1,100 mu of early rice, but there were 315 mu of winter fallow fields, 505 mu of rapeseed, and 300 mu of barley, which shows that there were enough fields to transplant the early seedlings. As for the problems of cold weather freezing the seedlings, lack of water, and manpower and animal power, they were not difficult to overcome. After such calculation and debate, not only did it help him overcome his conservative thinking, but also changed the views of some people who had similar ideas to him. Therefore, by the end of March, all the early rice in this cooperative had been sown.

    推动春耕的工具
    在春耕生产中，湖北江陵县先锋农业社副主任萧少成对适时早播有抵触，怎么说他也不相信早播的好处，社员摸着了他的心思，便贴了这样张大字报：“萧主任工作也不差，提起下秧有四怕：一怕秧芽下早了，没有空田把秧插；二怕秧芽下早了，天冷冻死芽；三怕秧芽下早了，塘里没有水来踏；四怕秧芽下早了，人力畜力赶不上它；我说你的思想日打瞎（不对头的意思），希望赶快扭转吧！”这张大字报一贴出，社员们接着开展了一场辩论，并且针对萧少成的四怕算了笔账：全社计划插早稻一千一百亩，但冬闲田就有三百一十五亩，油菜五百零五亩，大麦三百亩，这说明早下秧完全有田插秧，至于天冷冻芽、缺水以及人力畜力等问题，都不是什么大困难。经过这样一算一辩，不但帮助他克服了保守思想，连一些跟他有类似思想的人，也改变了自己的看法。因此，三月底，这个社的早稻就全部下种了。
