    The Morning Sun
    —A Record of the People of Zhaoyuan
    By Our Special Correspondent Liu Baiyu
    Just imagine the sun rising in the morning! Red, fresh, brilliant, and full of life. When you look at it, what's your state of mind? Recently, what I have seen and heard in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, has given me the same feeling.
    One morning, I set off from Zhaoyuan County to Yu Kuai (Happy) Township. The car crossed a large frozen lake. Looking around, the ice near the shore resembled thick, light blue glass, while the distance was a vast expanse of white ice and snow. Spring had quietly arrived, but the lake surface in the morning was still swept by a biting wind. Then I saw a team of people chiseling ice along the lake. Their faces were flushed, and steam rose from their bodies. It turned out that the leader was "Yang Banyue" (Yang Half-Night), the director of Dai Long Cooperative. Why would someone be called "Half-Night"? This needs a bit of explaining. His real name is Yang Shixun, and he was originally the director of the township credit cooperative. Not long ago, he was transferred to be the director of a cooperative. The previous director hadn't done a very good job. Initially, the masses didn't readily trust Yang Shixun either. Some people said behind his back: "Don't let a Sun Wukong leave, only for another monkey to arrive!" When this reached his ears, he buried himself in hard work for thirteen days and nights straight. When a horse got sick, he personally slept in the stable. When he promised to dig manure the next morning, he would get up in the middle of the night and start working by himself. From then on, he never slept a full night. Thus, the affectionate nickname "Yang Banyue" became widely known. Somehow, not long ago, Yang Shixun got another idea. Since then, cadres coming and going in the county often saw him squatting silently on the frozen lake, staring intently at the ice. People asked him, and they learned that he was figuring out how to draw water from the lake to irrigate the land and increase grain production. So now he was leading the cooperative members to break ice in the snow.
    This fragment of real life is like a door suddenly opening, revealing the scene of the people of Zhaoyuan marching forward valiantly like a mighty army. The people here are doing everything to resolutely jump, to jump fiercely, to jump over the Yellow River in one step, striving to become a 6,000-jin county this year (meaning harvesting 400 jin per mu). Zhaoyuan—formerly Gorlos Rear Banner—is a grassland beside the Songhua River. People here say: When the city was built, an ancient brick was dug up from the ground, with the character "肇" (Zhao) inscribed on it, hence the name Zhaoyuan. The road from Faku to Maoxing Station in this county, leading to Qiqihar, was the post road from Beijing to Heilongjiang during the Yuan and Qing dynasties. Now people still call the people of Maoxing "the people of the station." After years of silt accumulation by the river, the soil is extremely fertile. People from within the Pass (i.e., the area around the Great Wall) who come here pick up a piece of black soil from the fields and say, "In our place, this is fertilizer." But a serious problem is the short frost-free period, and the river often floods, causing disasters. Last year, seeing that bumper harvest exceeding even that of 1952, even the old farmers said with smiles, "This time, there's no running away from it!" Who knew that day and night typhoons combined with flood peaks would sweep everything away. This year's Great Leap Forward, at the county's four-level meetings, proposed a target of 6,000 jin per mu. How to achieve this? This launched a struggle with nature in Zhaoyuan. Look! This is a Zhaoyuan people's oath I copied from a large-character poster at Weixin Cooperative in Yu Kuai Township, using sorghum stalks stuck on a manure pile!
    Not afraid of strong winds or cold weather, if there are no candles, there are sky lanterns,
    Production leaps forward again and again, 8,500 jin will be real heroes.
    If the 6,000-jin target set by the county is already considered impressive, the people of Weixin Cooperative have raised the target to 8,500 jin. Six thousand jin or eight thousand jin, are these just dry numbers? These numbers contain the lively and dynamic content of rural life in our great socialist era.

      They Fight for Manure
    As the saying goes: Home soil exchanged for wild soil, one mu is worth two. So people are doing everything possible to find manure sources and deliver manure. When I arrived at Weixin Cooperative, countless men, women, old, and young rushed up like firefighters, some piling up soil from the kangs (heated brick beds), others pouring ice water. When I arrived at Youli Cooperative, a group of young women wearing floral cotton-padded jackets were shoveling up all the frozen soil from the streets and sending it onto carts without leaving a single bit. Staying in Yu Kuai Township for a few days, my heart couldn't help but soar with the people. Bao Xiangge, the township Party secretary, has great energy and ambition. During the Liberation War, he led a stretcher team through a thousand miles of wind and snow, transferring wounded soldiers from the front line across the Liao River, earning a special meritorious service award. Not long ago, he was still the Civil Affairs Section Chief of Zhaoyuan County. When he was sent down to the township, he ignited the fire of the Great Leap Forward, and the ancient grassland shone brightly. On the first day I arrived, we talked late into the night under a kerosene lamp. He said, "I have never experienced such a cold winter. Even the old people say they haven't seen such heavy snow in forty years." But the enthusiasm of the masses is like wind and fire, unafraid of any ice, snow, or severe cold. The accumulated manure had been sent away quickly, but it was still 50,382 tons short of the target of 40 tons per mu. What to do? Unleash the search for manure sources. Youli Cooperative found the mud under the ice of an old pond next to the village. Originally, rainwater that had been washing the village for years gathered here, along with dead fish and rotten leaves. Who knows how many ages it had been buried? A source of fertilizer was found, but a new problem arose. The ice was several meters thick, as hard as iron, and there was a great wind, heavy snow, and forty degrees below zero severe cold. How to dig in that unprotected meadow? Waiting for the ice to melt an inch before moving an inch would be too late. Secretary Bao took a deep puff of his cigarette, flicked off the ash, and said, "As for me? I had the determination, but I also had some doubts. I decided to take the thirteen-jin heavy pickaxe and try it myself. Using all my strength, the pickaxe bounced back as soon as it hit. After a few bangs, my arms couldn't bend, and my hands swelled up so much that I couldn't even button my collar." His furrowed, thick eyebrows suddenly relaxed. "But the masses corrected us. The masses chiseled up pieces of ice as large as tabletops and shouted happily, 'Come and see! Coal is coming out!' Hey, that mud under the ice was even blacker than coal. Our township Party committee took the lead, demanding that the whole Party act, the whole people act, overcome any difficulties, and just get to work. The more we worked, the braver we became, and the braver we became, the more we worked. People were excited and said, 'The horse pen of many years has turned over, and many stinky pits have become gold.' At that time, our place," he pointed to the township Party committee office and the township people's committee office next door and smiled, "the ambassador was the master chef of the kitchen, and the supply and marketing cooperative was guarded by a gatekeeper." Zhang Ping, the township public security committee member, became the boss of a big cart team, and Zhang Xiling, the female deputy township chief, loaded carts with the women. For ninety days and nights in Yu Kuai Township, the horses rested while the people didn't, and the people rested while the carts didn't. At night, we couldn't find the pickaxe marks when digging ice, and we stumbled and bumped while loading carts. A few large ice lamps were placed on top of the high manure piles. Someone looking from a distance said, "Why is the moon coming out so early?" "How could it be? How could the moon come out today?" It turned out that the ice lamps were transparent and bright, and one ice lamp was more dazzling than a 100-candlepower electric light. Some of the masses joyfully said, "We have sunlight during the day, ice lamps at night, and adding four more carts will guarantee success." The young people said, "The ground is frozen three feet thick, but it can't stop my young people's enthusiasm of thirty-six feet!" Batch after batch of women took to the field, pulling sleds and flying across the frozen ground to deliver manure, and large-character posters encouraged them: "The women of the second team are really capable, they work as hard as rockets!" In this way, when I arrived in Yu Kuai Township, 70% of the manure had already been sent to the fields. Looking from the ridge, a phenomenon never seen in history has appeared on the vast fields of the Heilongjiang plain. On that yellowish-brown carpet-like field, scattered and crisscrossed, piles of black, oily manure were like someone filling a chessboard with black pieces, like someone painting a beautiful pattern on this earth.

      They Fight for Water Conservancy
    To reach 6,000 jin per mu, fertilizer alone is not enough; water must also be solved.
    Speaking of water, the people of Zhaoyuan have suffered endless grievances, and Yu Kuai Township is no exception. Holding the Songhua River, they have no water to irrigate their land, and if they are not careful, they will suffer from external flooding and internal waterlogging. They dug wells, but the wells were washed away by floods; they installed water pumps, but they failed. At that time, someone composed a few quick clappers: "A chicken on the south mountain (referring to the water pump), a chicken on the north mountain (referring to the chicken farm), the south mountain doesn't produce water, the north mountain sprains its leg." It described their annoyed mood. But this year's socialist Great Leap Forward has inspired the whole township to be determined to overcome nature. They are building reservoirs, digging irrigation canals, and also installing pumping stations along the river. They worked through the night, even during the Spring Festival, and decided to start construction on the Shuishiyingzi pumping station on the first day of the new year. One night, Zhang Fenglin, the Party branch secretary of Youli Cooperative, took the lead, and the whole township mobilized a hundred large carts to haul sand from 130 li away. Just right, early in the morning of the first day, they hauled 370 tons of sand and arrived at Shuishiyingzi in time; at this time, the dozens of workers who were building the canal head also arrived on schedule. This news spread immediately: "The carts have arrived at the station! The carts have arrived at the station!" Hundreds of people carried foreign shovels and iron picks and rushed to Shuishiyingzi, and the canal head project of the irrigation station broke ground. Young women and elementary school students took Taiping drums and also flocked to the station, drumming and dancing on the ice-sealed and snow-covered, misty Songhua River bank. Everyone was excited and shouted, "Great! Let's inspect our strength!" So they surged up, and the big picks pounded轰轰轰. Even the truck drivers who transported the machines couldn't stand it any longer, jumped out of the trucks, and started working. That night, the lights on the construction site were lit, and several cooperatives in Yu Kuai Township, men, women, old and young, all stood on the ridges at the head of the village, looking remotely at the electric light that illuminated the black night of the grassland, laughing so hard that they couldn't close their mouths, saying, "Look! Isn't it like a city? We used to talk about the long-term vision, but isn't this the near-term vision now!" People sang a new song from the bottom of their hearts: "...a hundred carts hauled sand, steel bars and cement were all pulled in, the carts didn't stop on New Year's Eve, Shuishiyingzi was working happily, there are laborers, working actively, the big picks swung like cannonballs, the canal head was built on the first day of the new year, working together day and night,..." In Zhaoyuan, in addition to visiting the irrigation projects of Yu Kuai Township and Shengli Township, I also saw the endless crowds of people building river dams on the bank of the Songhua River. Building river dams is also an important key for the people of Zhaoyuan to ensure 6,000 jin. And this movement has never stopped since the deep winter. One day, County Party Secretary Ba Yanhuh returned to the county town from the countryside at night. The night was dark and the snow was heavy, and he lost his way. Looking up, he suddenly saw a long string of lights in the distance. Wasn't that the county town? So he and his companions quickened their pace and ran there. Getting closer, they saw that it was a sea of people, lighting an unknown number of ice lamps along the winding Songhua River bank.
    On the day I went to Yu Kuai Township, the weather was sunny and warm, and the soil was turning black. Who knew that the next day, an eighth-grade wind would blow again. I, Township Party Secretary Bao Xiangge, female Deputy Township Chief Zhang Xiling, and Public Security Committee Member Zhang Ping took a rubber-wheeled cart and went to Shuishiyingzi to see the irrigation project via Yongjie Cooperative, Yu Kuai Cooperative, and Weixin Cooperative. Although the sand and stones were flying and the sky and the earth were hazy, in the vast wilderness, as far as the eye could see, there were piles and teams of people everywhere, digging large ice blocks to dig the main canals! What was particularly touching was that the women wearing red headscarves were carrying dozens of kilograms of ice blocks on their backs. As the car passed the ridge, Comrade Bao Xiangge stood up from the car excitedly, waved his hand, pointed to the flat and sloping ridge that reached the horizon, and said, "Do you see that? When you come again in the summer, this whole area will be rice paddies." From his posture, I deeply felt the spirit and broad-mindedness of our working people. We found Township Chief Liu of Yu Kuai Township at the construction site of the pumping station. He was short in stature, with connected whiskers, and was a simple and honest farmer, but now he was standing in front of the unfolded blueprints, pointing his fingers and talking to us about the complex earthwork numbers and technical problems in the project. The main line that Yu Kuai Township is currently digging is fourteen li long and can irrigate 1,050 hectares of paddy fields this year.
    Think about it, what is all this? This is overwhelming the mountains and overturning the seas, this is creating the world, this is making water, soil, temperature, everything, obey the will of man.

      They Fight for a Great Leap Forward in Technology
    This great leap forward in agricultural production cannot rely on enthusiasm alone; there must also be technology. We must see that people are going through such struggles and becoming masters of science and civilization. Two days after leaving Yu Kuai Township, late one night, beside a long table in the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee office, Comrade Ba Yanhuh, the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, talked about this major issue. He said: "We want to cross the Yellow River, we want to complete ten years of targets in one year, the first problem is how to lead the farmers to march towards nature.
      "Work hard, fiercely, and vigorously, that's all no problem, but to get 6,000 jin into our hands, we have to implement it in everything, one plant per furrow, one hoe per plow. It's like: having a construction blueprint, but to realize it, you also need construction workers who have mastered the technology; a command post of an army, to ensure victory on the front line, needs soldiers who not only have courage but also have strategy. Only when the farmers are no longer blindly controlled by nature, but can in turn decide the fate of their own land, can our agricultural plan become a reality, which requires an agricultural technological revolution."
    In this office piled with a table of grain ears, corn, and rice ears, I felt that the people of Zhaoyuan had a good command post. As far as I know, members of the County Party Committee are studying agricultural science. Almost all have read "Soil Science," "Entomology," and scientific books about fertilizers. Comrade Ba Yanhuh has recently become very interested in the books of Darwin and Michurin. It was Michurin who said such wonderful words: "We should not wait for nature's gifts, but should take from nature."
    Comrade Ba Yanhuh said thoughtfully:
    "If you make a clay pot, if you break it, you can remake it. Agriculture is done once a year. If you don't do it well at once, it will reduce production, and you won't be able to catch up for another year. This is the chain nature of agricultural operations, if one link is broken, it wastes a year of labor." He looked up and smiled slightly. "We often say that making a mistake on this is a historic mistake, and that mistake written in that year cannot be changed. Now the masses have as much enthusiasm as you want, but it's just that they lack technology. Leadership work is the same. We should act as agricultural technicians. We require all cadres above the commune level in the county to reach the level of apprentice agricultural technicians within three years; and to enable all farmers in the county to learn to analyze soil, understand how to fight pests and diseases, and master the technology of scientific cultivation of various crops within five years. It would be good if every farmer was like a skilled worker who could operate various machines. Our task is to hand over technology to the farmers and let the farmers master their own destiny."
    The Zhaoyuan County Party Committee made a decision to conduct mass technical training throughout the county. First, seek the opinions of the farmers. The farmers were very happy to hear this and said, "This has come at the right time. This year we are striving for a great leap forward. Our young people are energetic and have strong fists, but they lack technology." Now Zhaoyuan County is setting up an eight-level technical system. Cadres at all levels from the county to the commune will have to take exams. Those who pass that level will be issued a certificate of agricultural technician of that level. Among the broad masses of farmers, starting this spring, agricultural technical training will be conducted through training classes, radio lectures, and other methods. This time, 97% of the county's main male and female labor force participated in the training. During these days when I was in Zhaoyuan, they were taking exams. The whole county is not only a battlefield for a great leap forward in agricultural production, but also a classroom for a great leap forward in science and technology, which has opened up a broad road for the technological revolution in the countryside.
    We talked late into the night. This is a spring night that is very worth cherishing! I know that this night is not silent in the vast countryside, but active. People say that the day when the Songhua River breaks and the ice floes run is coming soon. The land is waiting for spring sowing, and people's hearts are beating warmly. They work from late at night until dawn, which contains so much deep affection and sweetness. That day, in the team headquarters of a production team in Youli Cooperative, I saw how the women were carefully selecting grain seeds one by one like embroidery. Each bag of selected seeds was tested for germination twice before being piled neatly in the warehouse, bag after bag. The label on each bag also stated the percentage of germination rate. The farmers learned all the new technical methods and planted their warm intentions into the ground along with the seeds. This shows that the countryside is undergoing great changes, and people are undergoing great changes. When I was in Yu Kuai Cooperative, I asked old Pi Tou, the sixty-year-old feeder, "The soil is the same soil, the land is the same land, the enthusiasm is so great, what different things do you see?" The old man, wearing a white felt hat, replied, "The people are different, the people's hearts are different." Yes, the people are different, and the people's strength is emitted from the bottom of their hearts. This is not the first time I have walked on the vast fields by the Songhua River. Ten years ago, the snow was heavy, and the fire was soaring. Those were difficult war years. Now, the villages I have passed are all hotbeds, and everyone is striving for a leap forward. Large-character posters are on the walls, on the manure piles, on the construction sites of the canals, and in the straw-cutting sheds, like sparks of red fire, flying everywhere. People's eyes are bright, and people's hearts are hot. These large-character posters have supervision: "The first team is really amazing, they go out early and work hard, but they are not active in sending manure, the manure carts come out late, and the broken manure curtain can't stop the spokes of the wheels." There is encouragement: "Li Wanlu is really capable, he digs six and a half carts of manure a day, he accidentally broke his pickaxe, and he went home and used his own kang to exchange for it. If everyone can work like him, 8,500 jin will be guaranteed." It is really one wave pushing another, one wave surging another, if you are strong, I am even more ambitious than you, if you are smart, I am even more intelligent than you. And spring came when life was so boiling. On the day I was in Yu Kuai Township, a line of wild geese flew slowly north from the sea-blue sky. That night, in the township Party committee office, Secretary Bao Xiangge finished answering the phone and told me: "The original plan was to sow spring wheat on the sixteenth, but Yongjie Cooperative has already taken the lead and sown spring wheat ahead of schedule." This news, like a prairie fire, suddenly spread to every village. Everything is fast, everything is flying. When I returned to the county, I walked dozens of miles a day. I knew that the meadows and ice ponds I had seen now would be green rice fields in two months. Comrade Ba Yanhuh said: "We want to develop rice. Some people say this is an adventure. Do you think rice can be grown on the grassland? In 1954, we planted twenty-four mu and harvested it. We think that is just a spark of red, and now we should let rice blossom everywhere." This year, the county will have more than 53,000 mu of rice. Who says that people cannot overcome nature? Who says that we cannot turn the northern frontier into the Jiangnan? I left Zhaoyuan on a very sunny morning. The car sped on the highway, the distant forest was like smoke and mist, and the sun had just risen from my left, illuminating the sky and the wilderness with red and bright light. At this time, I savored what I had seen and heard in the past few days, and the state of mind described at the beginning of this newsletter floated in my heart. I know that this is our happiness, deep happiness, the happiness of the socialist era. (Attached picture)

    早晨的太阳
    ——记肇源的人们
    本报特约记者　刘白羽
    你想一想，早晨，刚刚升起的太阳吧！通红的光芒，清新、灿烂、生气勃勃。那时，你望着它，你的心境是怎么样呢？最近我在黑龙江肇源县所见所闻，就给我以同样的感觉。
    一个早晨，我从肇源县城出发到愉快乡去。车从一片大冰湖上穿过，一眼望去，冰湖近处像淡青色的厚玻璃，远处则是白茫茫的冰雪。春已悄然到来，但早晨的湖面依然寒风似剪。这时我看见一队人正在湖沿上凿冰，一个个红光满面，热气腾腾。原来那个打头的，就是代龙社主任“杨半夜”。一个人为什么叫“半夜”？这得慢慢说来。此人真名杨士勋，原为乡信贷社主任，不久以前才下放当合作社主任的。前届主任工作做得不够好。开头群众对于杨士勋也并不轻信。有人背地里说：“不要去个孙悟空，又来个猴吧！”这话落到他耳内，他就闷着头一口气苦干了十三昼夜。马病了，他就亲自睡在马棚；约好天明刨粪，他半夜就一个人叮噹地干起来了。从那以来，他从没睡过整夜的觉。由此，“杨半夜”这亲切的绰号就远近风闻了。不知怎样一来，前不久，杨士勋又转起一个念头，从此县里来来往往的干部，常常看到他一个人闷声不响地蹲在冰湖上望着那片冰湖出神。人们问他，才知道，原来他是琢磨着怎样引湖水灌地，增产粮食。于是现在他就带了社员们踏雪刨冰了。
    这个真实生活的片断，就如同一扇门霍地打开，展示了肇源人们千军万马、勇往直前的场面。这儿的人，一切为了坚决地跳，狠狠地跳，一步跳过黄河南，争取今年成为六千斤县（即每亩地收获四百斤）。肇源——郭尔罗斯后旗，是松花江边一片草原。这儿人传说：建城时挖地得一古砖，上书一“肇”字，故名肇源。从法库到此县的茂兴站去齐齐哈尔，为元、清时代由北京通往黑龙江的驿路。现在人们还管茂兴的人叫作“站上的人”。经江流多年淤积，土地极其肥沃。关里人来到此地从田间拈块黑土都说：“在我们那儿这就是肥料。”但严重问题是无霜期短，江水更常泛滥成灾。去年，眼看那一场超过了1952年的大丰收，连老农都眉开眼笑地说：“这回可没跑了！”谁知日夜台风加上洪峰，什么都一扫而光了。今年大跃进，全县的四级会议上，提出一垧六千斤的指标，怎样作才能达到呢？这便在肇源展开了一场和大自然的斗争。请看！这是我从愉快乡维新社用谷草秆插在粪肥堆上的一张大字报上抄下的肇源人们的誓言！
    不怕风大和天冷，没有蜡烛有天灯，
    生产跃进再跃进，八千五百斤上当英雄。
    如果说县里提的六千斤指标已算可观，维新社的人却把指标又提到八千五百斤了。六千也好，八千也好，难道这只是枯燥的数目字吗？这数目字正包含着我们这个社会主义大时代农村生活生动活泼的内容。
      他们为粪肥而战
    常言说：家土换野土，一亩顶两亩。于是人们千方百计找粪源，送粪肥。我到维新社，无数男女老幼，就像救火一样蜂涌直上，堆炕土的堆炕土，浇冰水的浇冰水。我到有利社，一群穿着花布棉袄的青年妇女，把街道上的冻土都一铲不留地铲下来送上大车。在愉快乡住了几天，我的心制止不住地和人们一道飞翔起来了。乡党委书记包向革，干劲大，志气豪，解放战争中他带着担架队，千里风雪，转战辽河，从火线上往下抱伤员，立下了特等功。不久前，他还是肇源县的民政科长，一下放到乡上就把跃进之火点燃，古老的草原于是闪光了。我来的头一天，我们在一盏煤油灯下，谈至夜深。他说：“我从来没经过这么冷的冬天，连老年人都说整四十年没见过这样大雪。”可是群众的干劲就如风似火，什么冰雪严寒都不怕。原来积的粪肥送得快透亮了，可是距离每亩四十吨的数字还差五万零三百八十二吨。怎么办？就放手找肥源。有利社把村旁边的一个老泡子的冰下泥找出来了。原来长年冲刷村庄的雨水都聚到这儿来，再加上死鱼烂叶，不知到底埋藏多少年代了。肥源找到，但又出了一个新问题，冰冻数米，坚如铁石，大风大雪、零下四十几度严寒，在那一无遮挡的大草甸子里怎么刨？等着冰化一寸再动一寸，那可赶不上趟。包书记深深地吸了一口烟，把烟灰抖掉说：“我呢？决心是有，可也有点怀疑。自己带上把十三斤重大镐去试试。用尽平生之力，镐一落下去就蹦回来了。砰砰几下，我的胳膊就拐不过弯，手就胀得连脖领都扣不上了。”他的皱拢的浓眉一下松了开来。“可是群众纠正了我们，群众把一块块桌面大的冰盘生凿了起来，还高兴地喊叫：‘快来看呀！出煤了！’嘿，那冰下泥比煤还黑。我们乡党委带头，要求全党动手，全民动手，有啥困难克服啥困难，就干起来了。愈干愈勇，愈勇愈干。人们兴高彩烈，说：‘多年马圈翻了身，多少臭坑变成金’，那时候，我们这地方，”他指了指乡党委办公室和隔壁的乡人民委员会办公室笑了笑说：“全权大使就是厨房的老师傅，供销社就由一个更官看门。”乡公安委员张平当上了赶大车的老板子，女副乡长张希玲跟妇女一道装车。愉快乡九十日夜以来，马休息人不休息，人休息车不休息。夜间我们刨冰找不着镐眼，装车的乱踩乱撞。几盏大冰灯摆在高高的粪堆顶上。远处有人看着说：“怎么月亮出的这样早？”“哪能，今天怎么出月亮？”原来就是冰灯透明铮亮，一盏冰灯比一百烛的电灯还闪眼。有的群众欢腾地说：“白天有日光，夜晚有冰灯，再增加四车有保证。”青年们说：“地冻三尺厚，挡不住我青年的热心三丈六！”妇女一批批上阵，拉着爬犁在冰冻上飞跑送粪，大字报上鼓励她们：“二队妇女真能干，干活的劲头像火箭！”就这样，当我到达愉快乡，粪肥已有70％送上地。从岗岭上看一看，黑龙江辽阔的原野上出现了历史上从来未有的现象，那草黄色的绒毯般平展展的田垅上，星罗棋布，纵横交错，一堆堆黑油油的粪肥，就像谁在棋盘上下满了黑棋子，就像谁给这大地画下了美丽的图案画。
      他们为水利而战
    要达到每亩六千斤，光有肥料不行，还得解决水。
    谈到水，肇源的人们可受了无穷的怨气，愉快乡自然也不例外。守着松花江没有水浇地，弄不好还来个外淹内涝。打过井，井给洪水冲了；装过抽水机结果也失败了。那时有人编了几句快板：“南山一只鸡（指抽水机），北山一只鸡（指养鸡场），南山不出水，北山蹬了腿。”记述了他们懊恼心情。可是今年社会主义大跃进，却鼓起全乡人一定要战胜大自然的决心。他们修水库、挖灌溉线，还就着江沿安设抽水站。春节不过连夜干，决定正月初一水师营子的抽水站开工。一个夜晚，有利社党支部书记张凤麟带头，全乡出动一百辆大车，到一百三十里地外去拉沙子。恰好初一清早，他们拉了三百七十吨沙子及时赶到水师营子；这时修渠首的几十个工人也按期到达。这消息一下传播开来：“大车进站了！大车进站了！”几百人扛上洋锹铁镐，奔到水师营子，灌溉站渠首工程就破土动工了。青年妇女、小学生拿了太平鼓，也蜂涌到站上去，就在那冰封雪冻、白雾茫茫的松花江岸上敲起鼓，跳起舞。大家兴奋起来，连声喊：“好呀！检阅检阅咱们的力量吧！”于是一涌而上，大镐轰轰轰地刨了起来。连运机器的汽车司机也看得眼热，跳下车干了。那一夜工地上电灯亮了，愉快乡几个社，男女老幼都站在村头岗岭上，遥望着那照亮了草原黑夜的电灯光，笑得合不拢嘴说：“你看！不像个城市？从前说远景，现在这不是近景了吗！”人们从心底里唱出一首新的歌：“……一百辆大车运沙子，钢筋水泥拉的全，大年三十车不住，水师营子干的欢，有民工，积极干，大镐抡的像炮弹，大年初一修渠首，黑夜白天一起干，……”我在肇源除参观了愉快乡的和胜利乡的灌溉工程外，还看到松花江岸上一望无际的修江坝的人群。修江坝也是肇源人们要保证六千斤的重要关键。而这运动也是深冬以来从未停止过。县委书记巴彦胡同志有一天夜里从乡间回县城，夜深雪大，一下迷失了路途。抬头一望，忽见远处一大溜灯光，那不就是县城吗？于是他和他的同伴便加紧脚步奔那儿走去。走近一看，原来是一片人山人海，沿着弯弯曲曲的松花江岸，点着不知多少盏冰灯。
    我到愉快乡那天，天气晴暖，地皮都发黑了。谁知第二天又刮起八级风来了。我和乡党委书记包向革、女副乡长张希玲、公安委员张平乘一辆胶皮轮大车，经永捷社、愉快社、维新社到水师营子去看灌溉工程。虽然飞砂走石，天地蒙蒙，漫荒野地里，一眼望不到头，一堆堆，一队队，还到处是人，在那儿刨大冰块子挖渠道干线呢！特别令人感动的是那些扎着红毛巾的妇女，把几十斤重的冰块背在脊梁上搬运。车过岗岭，包向革同志十分兴奋地从车板上站起来，把手一挥，指着那远到天边的平坡漫岗说：“你看见了吗？夏天再来，这一片就都是稻田了。”从他的姿态，我深深感到我们劳动人民的气魄与胸襟。我们在抽水站工地上找到了愉快乡的刘乡长，矮矮个子，连鬓胡子，是一个朴朴实实的农民，他现在却站在铺展开来的图纸面前，伸着手指，跟我们说着复杂的土方数字和工程上的技术问题了。愉快乡现在挖的这条干线有十四里长，今年可灌溉水田一千零五十公顷。
    请想想，这一切都是什么？这就是排山倒海，这就是开天辟地，这就是让水、让土壤、让气温，一切一切，服从人的意志。
    他们为技术大跃进而战
    这场农业生产大跃进，可不能只凭干劲，还得有技术。我们必须看到人们正经历着这样的斗争，而成为科学文明的主人。离开愉快乡后两天，一个深夜，在肇源县委办公室长桌旁，县委第一书记巴彦胡同志谈到这一个重大问题。他说：“我们要跨过黄河，要一年完成十年指标，头一个问题就是如何领导农民向大自然进军。
      “干，凶，猛，这都没问题，可是，要六千斤到手，就得一垅一株，一锄一犁，事事落实。这就像：有了建设的蓝图，但要实现它，还得有掌握了技术的施工员；一个军队的指挥部，要保证火线上取胜，就需要有不但有勇还要有谋的战士。只有农民不再是盲目地受自然支配，而反过来自己能决定自己这块土地的命运，我们的农业规划才能变为现实，这就需要来一个农业上的技术革命。”
    在这个堆了一桌子谷穗、包米和稻穗的办公室里，我感到肇源的人们有一个好指挥部。据我所知，县委委员都在钻研农业科学。差不多都读过了“土壤学”“昆虫学”以及有关肥料的科学书籍。巴彦胡同志最近对达尔文和米丘林的书感到极大兴趣。正是米丘林说过这样精彩的话：“不应当等待自然恩赐，应当向自然索取。”
    巴彦胡同志那样深思地说：
    “如果做个泥壶，你做坏了，还可以重做。农业一年一做。你一下子做不好就会减产，这一年就再也赶不上了。这就是农业操作的连锁性，一环坏了就浪费了一年的劳动。”他仰起头微微笑了一下“我们常说，在这上犯错误就是历史性错误，那错误写在那一年上就改不了了。现在群众的干劲要多少有多少，就是要技术。领导工作也是如此，我们应当作农业技术员。我们要求全县社以上干部，在三年内，都能达到见习农业技术员的水平；五年使全县农民都能初步地学会分析土壤、懂得怎样与病虫害作斗争，掌握各种作物科学栽培的技术。每一个农民都像一个能操作各种机械的熟练工人，那就好了。我们的任务，就是要把技术交给农民，让农民掌握自己的命运。”
    肇源县委作了在全县范围内进行全民技术训练的决定。先去征求农民意见，农民听了非常高兴，说：“这来得正好，今年争取大跃进，我们的小青年血热拳头硬，就是缺技术。”现在肇源县定为技术八级制。从县到社各级干部都要进行考试，考上那一级，就发给那一级农业技术员的证明。在广大农民中，从今春开始，采取办训练班，设广播讲座等方式进行农业技术训练。这一次，参加训练的占全县主要男女劳力的97％。我到肇源的这些天，他们正在进行考试。全县不但是农业生产大跃进的战场，同时，也是科学技术大跃进的课堂，这就给农村的技术革命开辟了广阔的道路。
    我们谈至深夜。这是十分值得珍惜的春天的深夜啊！我知道，这深夜在广大农村里，不是沉寂，而是活跃。人们说松花江开江跑冰排的日子快到了，土地在等待着春播，人们的心都热呼呼的砰砰跳，从深夜一直劳动到天明，这中间含着多少深情，多少蜜意。那天，在有利社一个生产队队部里，我看见妇女们怎样像绣花一样精细地一颗一颗地选着谷种。每一袋选过的种子，再经过两次发芽试验，然后才把它们一麻袋一麻袋，整整齐齐堆在仓库里，每个口袋的标签上还都写着发芽率的百分比，农民们学习着一切新的技术方法，把他们的温暖心意随着种子一起种入地下。这说明乡村在大变化，人在大变化。在愉快社的时候，我问六十几岁的饲养员老皮头：“土是同样的土，地是同样的地，干劲这样大，你看到底有什么不同了？”这个戴顶白毡帽头的老人回答我说：“人不同了，人的心不同了。”是的，人是不同了，人的力量从心底里发射出来。我不是第一次在这松花江边一望无际的田野上面行走了，十年前，大雪迷漫，火光冲天，那是艰难的战争年代；现在，我所经过的村庄，庄庄是热潮，人人争跃进。大字报在墙壁上，在粪堆上，在挖渠的工地上，在铡草的小屋里，像一星星红火，到处纷飞。人们的眼睛雪亮，人们的心肠滚烫。这些大字报，有督促：“第一队真出奇，起早贪黑送粪不积极，粪车出的晚，破粪帘还挡不住车辐眼。”有鼓励：“李万禄真能干，一天刨粪六车半，一时不慎把镐断，回家就用自己的炕沿换，我们大家都能像他这样干，八千五百斤保证会实现。”真是一波推一波，一浪涌一浪，你要强我比你还有志气，你聪明我比你还有智慧。而春天就在生活这样沸腾的时候到来了。我在愉快乡那天，一行大雁从海蓝的天空上缓缓地向北飞去了。那天夜晚，在乡党委办公室里，包向革书记接完电话，告诉我：“原来计划到十六号播春麦，永捷社昨天就捷足先登提前播春麦了。”——这消息，像燎原烈火一样，忽地传遍每个村庄。一切都是快速，一切都是飞跃。我回县里时，一天走了几十里地，我知道现在我所看到的这些草甸子、冰泡子，两个月后就将是绿油油一片稻田了。巴彦胡同志说：“我们要发展水稻，有人说这是冒险，你想草原上能种水稻吗？1954年我们种了二十四垧，收了。我们想那就是星星之火一点红，现在我们就应该让水稻遍地开花。”今年全县将出现水稻五万三千多亩。谁说人不能战胜自然？谁说我们不能变塞北为江南？我在一个非常晴朗的早晨，离开肇源。汽车在公路上飞奔，远方树林如烟似雾，太阳从我的左面刚刚升起，把天空和原野照得通红发亮。就在这时，我回味着这几日的见闻，在心中浮起这篇通讯开头所叙述过的那样的心境。我知道这就是我们的幸福，深深的幸福，社会主义时代的幸福。（附图片）
