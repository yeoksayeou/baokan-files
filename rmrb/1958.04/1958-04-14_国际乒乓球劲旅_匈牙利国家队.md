International Table Tennis Powerhouse - The Hungarian National Team

Hungary's table tennis sport boasts an extremely glorious and illustrious history. As early as 1927, at the first World Table Tennis Championships, Hungarian athletes captured all six championship titles. In the twenty-four World Championships held, Hungarian players have won eleven men's team titles, nine men's singles titles, ten men's doubles titles (one jointly), ten women's singles titles, eleven women's doubles titles (four jointly), and fifteen mixed doubles titles (four jointly).

In January of this year, renowned table tennis players from Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Great Britain held the first international table tennis competition of the year in Bucharest, with Hungarian players securing all five championship titles.

The first European Table Tennis Championships, which concluded in Budapest in early March, was a grand gathering of the most outstanding table tennis players in Europe, with over two hundred athletes from sixteen countries participating. Hungarian players won four of the seven championship titles. They also ranked among the top in the other three events. In the men's singles, Hungary had three of the last eight players remaining after the elimination rounds, and the finalists, Berczik and Jetel, were both Hungarian. In the women's singles, Hungarian players occupied four of the last eight spots. In the final, the third seed, Kóczián, defeated Heydon (England), who had repeatedly reached the singles finals in world championships and remained undefeated throughout this competition, by a score of three to two.

In the British Open Championships held in London with the participation of thirteen countries, they won three of the five championship titles.

In the past two or three years, new forces in Hungarian table tennis have emerged continuously. More than ten rising stars participated in the European Championships. Berczik, recognized as one of the world's most outstanding table tennis players, is only twenty years old. In 1955, he won the Hungarian National Youth Table Tennis Championship. Last year, when Japanese players visited Hungary, the then-world champion Tanaka and former world champion Ogimura were both defeated by Berczik. Berczik has consecutively won three men's singles titles in the four major international competitions held in Bucharest, Budapest, Tours, and London this year, and has jointly won multiple doubles titles with others. He was recently ranked as the world's third seed in table tennis. Jetel, the 1957 Hungarian champion, has won the national championship three times in a row and won the European men's singles runner-up this year. Another young player, Földi, is famous for his strong spin.

Among Hungarian female table tennis players are renowned players such as Kóczián, Mossóczy, Kerekes, Farkas, and Lantos. Mossóczy and another Hungarian player won the 1957 women's doubles championship. Kóczián is last year's Hungarian champion and this year's European women's singles champion. She is known for her agility and ability to fiercely smash the ball with both her backhand and forehand. Farkas and Berczik together won this year's European mixed doubles championship. Both of them are brave generals who are good at both attacking and defending.

    国际乒乓球劲旅——匈牙利国家队
    匈牙利的乒乓球运动具有极其光辉显赫的历史。早在1927年，第一届世界乒乓球锦标赛时，匈牙利的健将们就夺得了全部六个项目的冠军。在举行过的二十四届世界锦标赛中，匈牙利选手先后取得了十一次男子团体冠军，九次男子单打冠军，十次男子双打冠军（一次是联合取得的），十次女子单打冠军，十一次女子双打冠军（有四次是联合取得的），十五次男女混合双打冠军（有四次是联合取得的）。
    今年1月间，罗马尼亚、匈牙利、南斯拉夫和英国的著名乒乓球运动员在布加勒斯特举行了今年第一次乒乓球国际比赛，匈牙利的选手拿到了所有五个项目的冠军。
    3月初在布达佩斯结束的第一届欧洲乒乓球锦标赛是一次欧洲最优秀的乒乓球运动员的大会战，一共有十六个国家的二百多名选手参加。匈牙利选手在七个项目的比赛中就夺得了四个冠军。另外三项也都名列前茅。复赛时，男子单打经淘汰剩下的最后八人中，匈牙利占了三人，最后争夺冠军的别尔切克和杰特维都是匈牙利人。而女子单打的最后八人中，匈牙利选手就占了四人之多。决赛时，第三号种子高基安以三比二击败多次获得世界赛单打决赛权、并且在这次比赛中一直没有输过的海顿（英格兰）。
    在伦敦举行的有十三国参加的英国公开锦标赛中他们获得了五个项目中的三项冠军。
    近两三年来，匈牙利乒乓球运动新生力量不断涌现。参加欧洲锦标赛的选手中就有十多个后起之秀。被公认为世界最杰出的乒乓球运动员之一的别尔切克现在只有二十岁，1955年他获得匈牙利全国青年乒乓赛冠军。去年，日本选手访问匈牙利时，当时的世界冠军田中和前世界冠军荻村也都曾为别尔切克所败。别尔切克在今年的布加勒斯特、布达佩斯、都尔和伦敦举行的四次重大国际比赛中，接连赢得三次男子单打冠军，并同别人联合取得了多次双打冠军。最近又被评为世界乒乓球第三种子。1957年匈牙利冠军杰特维曾经一连三次获得全国冠军，今年又荣获了欧洲男子单打亚军。另一名青年选手福尔迪以旋转力强而著名。
    匈牙利女子乒乓球运动员中有著名的好手高基安、莫沙奇、克雷克斯、法卡斯和兰托斯等。莫沙奇同另一名匈牙利选手曾获得1957年女子双打的冠军。高基安是去年全匈冠军和今年欧洲女子单打冠军。她以动作灵敏，反手正手都能猛烈抽杀而著称。法卡斯同别尔切克一起获得今年欧洲的混合双打冠军，这两人都是能攻善守的勇将。
