How to Choose a Crystal Radio?
How to choose a crystal radio? Comrade Zhang Ziqiang from the First Commercial Department Transportation Electrical and Mechanical Equipment Trading Bureau introduces the following:

    First, the antenna, lead-in wire, and ground wire of a crystal radio are best made of multi-strand stranded wire made of purple copper. The seven-strand, three-steel, four-copper antenna currently sold in stores is also good, with high efficiency, cheap price, good tensile strength, and is not easy to break. The lead-in wire is best made of seven-strand yarn connection wire. A typical lead-in wire with a length of 14.53 meters is sufficient. The ground wire is also best made of purple copper, but the requirements for the ground wire are not too strict; stranded wire, single wire, with or without insulation can be used.

    Second, a dual-circuit crystal radio has better sensitivity and selectivity. The crystal used in crystal radios is divided into two types: fixed and adjustable. Adjustable crystals are better because they are easy to adjust to the sensitive point. The headphone jack on the crystal radio has one pair and two pairs. One pair is generally only for one person, and two pairs can be used by two people at the same time. The appearance of the crystal radio can be divided into several types, such as a square box portable type and a radio-like type. The appearance of the crystal radio does not affect the performance of the crystal radio.

    Third, the headphones. Generally, the headphones used in crystal radios are permanent magnet 2000-ohm headband-style stereo headphones.

    After you have the antenna, lead-in wire, ground wire, crystal radio, and headphones, you can listen to the radio as long as you set up the antenna, lead-in wire, and ground wire. Because the antenna and lead-in wire are higher off the ground, they easily absorb lightning. In order to protect people and the crystal radio from lightning strikes, a lightning arrester needs to be installed on the lead-in wire. This type of lightning arrester for crystal radios is very convenient to use.

    怎样选购矿石收音机？
    怎样选购矿石收音机？第一商业部交通电工器材贸易局张自强同志来信介绍如下：
    第一、矿石收音机的天线、引入线和地线最好用紫铜制成的多股绞线。目前商店里出售的有一种七股三钢四铜的天线也不差，效率高，售价便宜，拉力好，不易折断。引入线最好用七股的纱接线。一般的引入线有十四点五三公尺长就够了。地线也是以紫铜制的为最好，不过对地线的要求并不太严格，绞线、单线，外层有无绝缘物都可以用。
    第二、矿石机以双回路的敏度和选择性较好。矿石机所用的矿石分为固定的和活动的两种；活动矿石因为便于调节灵敏点，所以比较好。矿石机上的听筒扦口有一对的和两对的，一对的一般仅能供一人用，两对的可供两人同时用。矿石机的外形可分为方匣携带式和仿收音机式的数种，矿石机的外形对矿石机的性能没有影响。
    第三、听筒。一般矿石机所用的听筒都是永久磁铁二千欧姆头戴双耳式。
    有了天线、引入线、地线，矿石机和听筒后，只要把天线、引入线和地线架设好，就可以收听广播了。天线和引入线因为离地面较高，所以容易吸收雷电，为了保障人身和矿石机不被雷电击伤，需要在引入线上安一个避雷器。这种矿石收音机用的避雷器使用很方便。
