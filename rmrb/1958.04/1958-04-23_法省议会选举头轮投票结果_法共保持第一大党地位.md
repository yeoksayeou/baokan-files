    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 22nd: TASS reports that according to materials released by the French Ministry of the Interior, 7,916,389 voters participated in the first round of provincial assembly elections in mainland France and its overseas territories on April 20th, accounting for 67.3% of the total number of voters.
    The French Communist Party received 22.3% of all votes cast, the Socialist Party received 17.6%, the so-called "center-left" parties (Radical Socialist Party, Democratic Socialist Resistance Union, Left Republican Union, etc.) received 15.2%, the Popular Republican Movement (Catholic Party) received 10.6%, right-wing party groups received 23.4%, the Social Republican Party received 3.5%, and the extreme right-wing Poujadists received 2.2%.
    Only about half of the nominated candidates obtained the absolute majority of votes required for election in the first round. A second round of voting will be held on April 27th in towns where provincial assembly members were not elected.
    The election results show that, as in the past, the Communist Party remains the largest party, receiving the most votes, and now a majority of votes are in the hands of left-wing parties (Communist Party, Socialist Party, Radical Socialist Party).
    The term of the French provincial assembly is six years, with half of the members being re-elected every three years. This time, 1,589 provincial assembly members should be elected.
    The election is conducted by county (an electoral unit between the province and the city). Regardless of the number of voters, each county elects one provincial assembly member. This unfair system gives agricultural counties with small populations the same representation in the provincial assembly as industrial counties with large populations. This unreasonable system is beneficial to bourgeois parties in consolidating their power in the provinces and limits the political influence of emerging cities.
    The reactionary two-round majority electoral system adopted in this election also benefits right-wing parties. This system is: in the first round of elections, only candidates who obtain more than half of all votes can be elected, while in the second round, a relative majority is sufficient for election. In this way, right-wing parties unite in the second round of elections, preventing voters from electing left-wing candidates as their legitimate representatives in the provincial assembly.

    法省议会选举头轮投票结果
    法共保持第一大党地位
    据新华社22日讯　塔斯社巴黎讯：根据法国内政部发表的材料，20日参加法国本土及其海外领地的省议会选举的选民有七百九十一万六千三百八十九人，占选民总数的67.3％。
    法国共产党所得选票占全部选票22.3％，社会党得票17.6％，所谓“中左”各党（激进社会党、民主社会抵抗联盟、左翼共和联盟等）得票15.2％，人民共和党（天主教党）得票10.6％，右翼党派集团得票23.4％，社会共和党得票3.5％，极右的布热德分子得票2.2％。
    被提名的候选人当中，只有一半左右获得了在第一轮选举中当选所必需的绝对多数选票。没有选出省议会议员的市镇将于4月27日进行第二轮投票。
    选举结果表明，像过去一样，共产党仍然是第一大党，它得到的选票最多，而且现在多数票已经掌握在左翼党派（共产党、社会党、激进社会党）手里。
    法国省议会任期六年，每隔三年改选半数的议员。这次应该选出一千五百八十九名省议会议员。
    选举是按各个郡（介于省和市之间的选举单位）进行的。不管选民多少，每郡都选出一个省议员。这种不公平的制度使得人口少的农业郡和人口多的工业郡在省议会中具有同样的代表额。这种不合理的制度有利于资产阶级政党巩固自己在省内的势力，并且限制新兴城市的政治影响。
    在这次选举中所采用的反动的二轮投票多数选举制也是符合右翼党派的利益的。这种制度是：在第一轮选举中只有得到全部选票半数以上的候选人才能当选，而在第二轮选举中有相对多数就能当选。这样，右翼党派在第二轮选举中联合起来使选民无法把左翼候选人选为他们在省议会中的合法代表。
