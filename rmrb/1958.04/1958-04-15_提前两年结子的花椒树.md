    Sichuan Pepper Tree Bearing Fruit Two Years Early
    Lu Guangtian
    In the yard of a household in Xicun, a northern suburb of Beijing, a batch of Sichuan pepper trees were planted at the same time. When most of the Sichuan pepper trees were still growing, one of them bore fruit two years earlier, which attracted a lot of attention. It turned out that two different propagation methods were used when planting this batch of Sichuan pepper trees: one was seed sowing, and the other was cutting propagation. Seed-sown Sichuan pepper trees mature later; cutting-propagated ones mature earlier. Currently, this Sichuan pepper tree is growing well and is kept in the back garden of the Palace Museum.

    提前两年结子的花椒树
    卢光天
    在北京市北郊西村一家住户的院里，同时种有一批花椒树。当大多数花椒树还正在成长的时候，其中有一棵提前两年结了子，引起人们很大的注意。原来这批花椒树在种的时候采用了两种不同的繁殖方法：一种是采用子播；一种是采用插枝。子播的花椒树成熟较晚；插枝的成熟较早。目前这棵花椒树生长良好，存放在故宫博物馆后花园内。
