Meng Xiancheng, President of East China Normal University, is compiling "Historical Materials on Chinese Education," while Chen Yuan, President of Beijing Normal University, is also compiling "Historical Materials on Ancient Chinese Education," and Shu Xincheng, a Shanghai educator, is compiling "Historical Materials on Modern Chinese Education." "Historical Materials on Chinese Education" and "Historical Materials on Modern Chinese Education" are both expected to be finalized and sent to press this year.

Among them, "Selected Writings on Tao Xingzhi's Education" and "Selected Writings on Yang Xianjiang's Education" may be published this year.

In order to organize and summarize the educational experiences of the old liberated areas, the preparatory office of the Institute of Educational Sciences is compiling "Educational Historical Materials from Revolutionary Base Areas during the Chinese New Democratic Revolution." Two or three volumes may be published this year.
