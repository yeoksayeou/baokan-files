    The Teaching Method of "Emphasizing the Foreign and Neglecting the Domestic" Should Be Abolished

    The discussion on the problem of "emphasizing the present and belittling the past" has made me think that there is also a problem worth discussing in the teaching of technical sciences. That is, should we "emphasize the foreign and neglect the domestic," or should we "emphasize the domestic and neglect the foreign"?

    After four years of study, we still don't have a complete understanding of the distribution of iron ore areas, ore reserves, and ore properties in China; but we know a lot about the "Krivoy Rog mining area" (Soviet Union) and the Lake Superior region (United States). We have a clearer understanding of modern sintering machines used for sintering, but we know nothing about the sintering pots used in domestic small and medium-sized enterprises. When talking about the charging system, we only talk about the skip car type and not the skip hoist type. However, there are very few blast furnaces in China that use skip car charging, so during this graduation practice, we didn't know how to adjust the furnace top when we saw blast furnaces with skip hoist charging.

    I believe that "emphasizing the domestic and neglecting the foreign" is also a matter of how theory is linked to practice. I think that in technical sciences, we should emphasize "emphasizing the domestic and neglecting the foreign." Saying this does not mean that I disagree with absorbing foreign, especially Soviet, theories; on the contrary, I think the purpose of our learning foreign theories is to guide our country's production practice. Therefore, a teaching policy that only learns foreign theories without combining them with China's actual situation cannot guide production practice.

### “厚外薄中”的教学方式应取消

    “厚外薄中”的教学方式应取消
    由于这次厚今薄古问题的讨论，使我想到在技术科学的教学中，也存在着一个值得讨论的问题。这就是应当“厚外薄中”呢，还是“厚中薄外”？
    我们四年学完之后，对于国内铁矿区的分布、矿石储量、矿石性质等尚无完整概念；但我们却知道了不少关于“克利沃洛矿区”（苏联）、上湖区（美国）的情况。对于烧结用的现代化的烧结机有了较清楚的了解，但对于国内中、小企业有那些烧结锅却一点不懂。在讲上料系统时，只讲料车式的而不讲料缶式的，然而国内用料车上料的高炉寥寥可数，所以这次毕业实习看到料缶式上料高炉不知如何进行炉顶调剂。
    我认为，“厚中薄外”也是理论如何联系实际的问题。我觉得在技术科学方面应当强调“厚中薄外”，这样说决不意味着我不同意吸收外国特别是苏联的理论；恰恰相反，我以为我们学习外国理论的目的是为了指导我国的生产实践，因而只学外国理论而不结合我国现实情况的教学方针，是不能够指导生产实践的。
