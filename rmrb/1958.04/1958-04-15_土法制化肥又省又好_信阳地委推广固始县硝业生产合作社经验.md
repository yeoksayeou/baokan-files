Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 13th: The Gushi County Nitrate Production Cooperative in Henan Province has successfully used local methods to trial-produce a comprehensive chemical fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This fertilizer is made from materials such as crude alkali, nitrate waste water, cow bone meal, cow bone water, and gypsum. Every 100 jin of fertilizer requires 25 jin of crude alkali, 7 jin 12 liang of nitrate waste water, 16 jin 4 liang of cow bone water, 7 jin 12 liang of nitrate salt, 7 jin 12 liang of alkali salt, 2 jin of gypsum, 4 jin 12 liang of cow bone meal, and 50 jin of lime.

    To make the fertilizer, first boil the alkali water in a pot, and boil off the water. Then, add the nitrate waste water and cow bone water to the pot and boil until the water becomes thick. Then add the gypsum, cow bone meal, nitrate salt, and alkali salt to further decompose and congeal the solution. When the solution becomes the consistency of rice soup, pour in the lime, stir evenly, and spread it out to dry, and the local chemical fertilizer is complete. This comprehensive chemical fertilizer has four advantages: abundant raw materials, can be made everywhere, and can be produced in large quantities; simple production equipment; easy operation, only ordinary large pots, water tanks and pulverizers are needed for production, and from ingredients to finished product, each person can produce an average of 500 jin per day; low cost and high fertilizer efficiency. Every 100 jin of raw materials can produce 84 jin of finished product, with each jin worth 9.2 fen. According to scientific analysis, the nitrogen content of each jin of local chemical fertilizer is equivalent to seven times that of human manure. The members of this cooperative applied this fertilizer to a piece of barren wheat field, and a few days later the wheat seedlings turned from yellow to green, and the branches and leaves became thick and strong.

    After the successful local method of making chemical fertilizer, the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-the-spot meeting in Gushi County. Now, this experience has been promoted to all counties in the entire region.

    土法制化肥又省又好
    信阳地委推广固始县硝业生产合作社经验
    新华社郑州13日电　河南省固始县硝业生产合作社用土法试制含有氮、磷、钾三种元素的综合性化学肥料成功。这种肥料是用柴碱、硝老水、牛骨粉、牛骨水和石膏等原料制成的。每一百斤肥料需用柴碱二十五斤，硝老水七斤十二两，牛骨水十六斤四两，硝盐七斤十二两，碱七斤十二两，石膏二斤，牛骨粉四斤十二两，石灰五十斤。制时先将碱水放入锅内煮沸，把水分烧干后，再将硝老水、牛骨水下锅煮沸，直到水由稀变稠，再放入石膏、牛骨粉、硝盐、碱盐，使溶液进一步分解胶结，当溶液变成米汤形状以后，再倒入石灰，捣拌均匀并且把它摊晾干，就成为土制化学肥料。这种综合性的化学肥料有四个优点：原料丰富，到处可制，又能大量生产；生产设备简单；操作容易，只用普通的大锅、水缸和粉碎机就可以生产，从配料到制成，平均每人每天能生产五百斤；成本低，肥效大。每百斤原料可出成品八十四斤，每斤价值九分二厘，据科学化验，每斤土制化肥的含氮量相当于人粪肥的七倍。这个社的社员曾在一块黄瘦的麦田里施上这种化肥，几天后麦苗就由黄变绿，枝叶肥壮。
    土法制化学肥料成功以后，中共信阳地委曾在固始县召开现场会议，现在，这个经验已经推广到全专区各县。
