    Thoughts on Reading Notices
    Wu Lü
    In the summer of the year before last, I read notices from three city bus companies. Because I found them interesting, I copied them down. A few days ago, I flipped them out and reread them, and compared to today's reality, I feel they still have some meaning, so I'll copy them for everyone to see first.
    One is from Jinan City: "In order to do a good job in preventing heatstroke and cooling down, the bus lines plan to reduce the number of trips when the temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit, in order to prevent passengers from suffering heatstroke and ensure their safety. Passengers are requested to board according to the vehicle's capacity. We hereby inform you."
    One is from Taiyuan City: "Due to the current shortage of vehicles, passengers who have purchased advance tickets and trial monthly tickets cannot board on time, which not only delays everyone's work, but also causes confusion in traffic order. According to the instructions of the higher-level Public Utilities Bureau, in addition to requiring relevant units to solve the transportation of employees themselves as much as possible, it has been decided to suspend the sale of advance tickets and trial monthly tickets of our company from September 1st. Please forgive us."
    One is from Zhanjiang City: "Due to urban development and dense pedestrian traffic on the streets, which may cause traffic danger, our company, with the approval of higher authorities, will not arrive at Cunjin Bridge and the Department Store after 5:30 pm every Saturday and all day on Sunday, starting from the 18th of this month..."
    These three notices have wonderfully different routes to the same destination. They seem to be thinking of passengers everywhere, both caring about "preventing passengers from suffering heatstroke," worrying about "delaying everyone's work," and also worrying about "causing traffic danger," truly a kind heart. However, anyone can easily see that what is missing in these three notices is precisely consideration for the passengers. If thinking of the passengers, why reduce the number of trips in the scorching heat of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, leaving the passengers on the streets under the scorching sun? If thinking of the passengers, why make the advance tickets and monthly tickets, which facilitate passengers and simplify ticketing procedures, sacrifices to "not only delay work, but also cause confusion in traffic order"? If thinking of the passengers, why is it that precisely when there are the most people riding, precisely in the places where there are the most people riding, the buses "do not arrive"?
    At that time, I also wrote a short article based on these three notices. A comrade said to me that there are few cars and many people, which is an objective difficulty. If there were better ways, these three bus companies would not have taken this last resort. I thought about it, and this was right. In order to avoid one-sided criticism, I put that short article in the drawer.
    As it happens, a few days ago, I flipped through newspapers from various places and saw notices from several city bus companies, with meanings that were very different from the three I copied the year before last. Comparing them, they are thought-provoking.
    This time, one is from Beijing City: "In the great anti-rightist movement, all employees of our company... through vigorously tapping the potential of equipment, improved transportation efficiency, saved more than 30 vehicles, and put them into operation on 15 newly opened and adjusted routes to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural development and the city's residents, and to better serve the people of the city."
    One is from Xi'an City: "In the great leap forward in production, our company, after employee discussion, shortened station stop times and strengthened vehicle turnover without reducing the driving interval. From April 11th..."
    There is also one from Taiyuan City, which once "required relevant units to solve the transportation of employees themselves" and decided to "suspend the sale of advance tickets and trial monthly tickets": "In order to meet the requirements of employees and citizens, the 12th bus route was opened on March 15th..."
    Comparing the three notices from the year before last with the three reports this year, I have gained some enlightenment. Few cars and many people, hot weather, passenger heatstroke, dense pedestrian traffic, etc., are probably indeed objective difficulties. But there are two attitudes in the face of objective difficulties. One is to retreat. It is very easy for people to want to retreat. All kinds of seemingly right but actually wrong "reasons" can be picked up at hand to "safely withdraw." The three notices from the year before last are examples. One is to promote. If there are difficulties, overcome them and move forward. This is more difficult, but as long as the idea of promotion is clear and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses is aroused, there is no need to worry about not having a way. The Beijing Public Transportation Company started by improving transportation efficiency, saving more than 30 vehicles, and opening and adjusting 15 bus routes at once. Isn't that an excellent example? It can be seen that taking a promoting attitude towards everything is the revolutionary attitude.
    The retreating notices are gone, and the promoting notices are eye-catching. This is a side proof that the rectification campaign is going well and the leap forward is going well.

### 读布告有感

    读布告有感
    吴滤
    前年夏天，读过三个城市公共汽车公司的布告。因为觉得很有意思，就抄录下来。前几天翻出来重读了一遍，对照今天的现实，觉得也还有些意思，先抄给大家看看。
    一是济南市的：“为了做好防暑降温工作，各线公共汽车拟在华氏一百度时减少车次，以防止乘客中暑，保证其安全，希乘客按车内定员乘车。特此敬告。”
    一是太原市的：“由于目前车辆供不应求，致使售出之预售票和试办月票的乘客不能按时乘车，不但贻误大家工作，并且造成行车秩序混乱。根据上级公用事业管理局指示，除要求各有关单位尽量自行解决职工的交通工具外，并决定于9月1日起，将本公司的预售票和试办月票暂停出售，请原谅为荷。”
    一是湛江市的：“兹因城市发展，街道行人稠密，恐会造成行车危险，我公司经奉上级批准，于本月18日起，每逢星期六下午五时半以后及星期日整天，不到达寸金桥及百货公司……”
    这三份布告真有异曲同工之妙。看来好像是处处为乘客着想，既关怀“防止乘客中暑”，又耽心“贻误大家工作”，还忧虑“恐会造成行车危险”，真是一片好心肠。然而，任何人都不难一眼看出，这三份布告里所缺少的，恰恰是为乘客着想。若为乘客着想，华氏一百度的大热天里，何至反而减少车次，把乘客扔在烈日下的大街上呢？若为乘客着想，何至硬把便利乘客、简化售票手续的预售票和月票，拉来做“不但贻误工作，并且造成行车秩序混乱”的牺牲品呢？若为乘客着想，何至正是在乘车的人最多的时候，正是在乘车的人最多的地方，公共汽车却“不到达”了呢？
    当时，也曾根据这三份布告写了一篇短文。有同志对我说，车少人多，这是客观困难，若有较好的办法，这三个公共汽车公司也不会出此下策。我一想，这话也对，为避免批评的片面性，就把那篇短文塞在抽屉里了。
    事有凑巧，前几天翻阅各地报纸，又见到几个城市公共汽车公司的布告，同前年抄的三份，意思竟大不相同了。对照起来看，耐人寻味。
    这回，一是北京市的：“在伟大的双反运动中，我公司全体职工……通过大力挖掘设备潜在能力，提高了运输效率，节约车辆三十余部，投入到新开辟的及调整的十五条路线上运行，以适应工农业发展和全市居民的需要，更好地为全市人民服务。”
    一是西安市的：“我公司在生产大跃进中，经过职工讨论，在不减少行车间隔的基础上，缩短站停时间，加强车辆周转。从4月11日起……”
    还有一个，就是曾经“要求各有关单位自行解决职工的交通工具”，并决定“将本公司的预售票和试办月票暂停出售”的太原市的：“为了适应职工市民要求，于3月15日开辟十二路公共汽车……”
    前年的三份布告和今年的三份报告一对照，我有了一些启发，车少人多，天气炎热，旅客中暑，行人稠密等等，这恐怕确是客观困难。但在客观困难面前也有两种态度。一是退缩。人要想后退，那是非常容易的，各种各样似是而非的“理由”，随手拈来，就可以“安全撤退”。前年的三份布告就是例子。一是促进，有困难，克服它，前进。这比较难些，但只要明确了促进的思想，鼓起了群众的革命干劲，也不愁没有办法。北京市公共汽车公司从提高运输效率着手，节约车辆三十余部，一次开辟和调整十五条公共汽车路线，不是绝好的榜样吗？可见，对一切事情采取促进的态度，才是革命的态度。
    退缩的布告不见了，促进的布告引人注目，这是整风整得好，跃进跃得好的一个旁证。
