    Another Reprimand of the Kishi Nobusuke Government for Sabotaging the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement
    Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's response on April 9 regarding the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and the remarks by Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi concerning this agreement, fully expose the true face of the Japanese government's sabotage of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The three Japanese organizations responsible for signing the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement with China have already notified the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade of the Japanese government's response. Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, in his reply to the three Japanese organizations, resolutely refused to accept the Japanese government's response and refuted Nobusuke Kishi's slanderous remarks openly hostile to our country, thoroughly exposing the Japanese government's plot to sabotage the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. We fully support the solemn statement made by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.
    The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was signed "in order to further promote the development of trade between China and Japan, and to strengthen the friendship between the people of China and Japan, based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit." The various clauses of the agreement and its inseparable memorandum also fully implement the principle of reciprocity. This spirit must not be distorted. But where in Kishi Nobusuke's reply is there a trace of equality and mutual benefit? Where is there a trace of "strengthening the friendship between the people of China and Japan"? Departing from the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and filled with hostility towards the Chinese people, he only wants to gain from Sino-Japanese trade; from this, we cannot fail to smell an evil imperialist odor.
    What does Kishi Nobusuke's government's response mean? It can be clearly seen from Aiichi Kiichi's remarks annotating Kishi Nobusuke's reply: it is to make a big deal out of the issue of "privileges," using Japanese domestic laws as an excuse to not provide security guarantees for Chinese commercial representative offices, using the lack of recognition of the government as a pretext to condone the Chiang Kai-shek clique and Japanese militarists insulting the Chinese national flag; and the "international relations" mentioned by Kishi Nobisuke obviously refer to the Japanese government's relations with the United States and the Chiang Kai Shek group. The United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group not only are hostile towards Sino-Japanese trade, but also try every possible means to undermine our country. Kishi Nobusuke, when he visited Taiwan last year, openly expressed to the Chiang Kai-shek group that "counter-attacking the mainland is very good," which is a universally known fact.
    During Japan's war of aggression, Kishi Nobusuke was already a veteran in formulating imperialist policies. Now, the Japanese monopoly capital served by the Kishi Nobusuke government is still built on the economic structure of the past Japanese imperialist era, and it also "prospered" after the war from the Korean War's bloodbath, relying on the "special procurement" orders from the United States. The Kishi Nobusuke government follows the United States' policy of war preparation, actively reorganizes its armed forces, and is equipping the "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons that the Japanese people deeply detest, so that the Japanese arms industry can reap huge profits from this. In order to open up markets for Japan's abnormally developed industry, and to pave the way for the foreign expansion of Japanese monopoly capital, the Kishi Nobusuke government also attempts to rebuild the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" under new signboards such as the "Southeast Asia Development Fund" and the "Asian Market." Domestically, it is even more actively preparing to revise the constitution, intensify the suppression of peace and democratic forces, revive militaristic education, and strengthen control over education. All of this gives people a sense that a latent imperialist undercurrent is stirring in Japan.
    It is not surprising that the Kishi Nobusuke government has consistently adopted a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people, based on this potential expansionist policy stance. Not to mention Kishi Nobusuke's pursuit of the United States' conspiracy to create "two Chinas," harboring members of the so-called "Taiwan Independence League" Liao Wenyi's group, and the imperialist ambition to create public opinion about "Taiwan's return to Japan"; just looking at the Sino-Japanese trade issue, the Kishi Nobusuke government has done everything possible to obstruct and undermine it since coming to power.
   The Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, which was supported and assisted by former Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, failed to be fully implemented due to the obstruction and sabotage of the Kishi Nobusuke government. After the expiration of the Third Trade Agreement in May of last year, the Kishi Nobusuke government first used the fingerprint issue as an excuse, and later added obstacles by limiting the number of commercial representative offices, causing the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement to be delayed for a long time. In February of this year, under strong accusations from the Japanese people and business circles, Kishi Nobusuke had to reluctantly agree to representatives from the three Japanese organizations coming to our country to sign the Fourth Trade Agreement, but at the same time he brought up four "points of understanding" to attempt to tamper with the content of the agreement draft and memorandum, which had already been unanimously agreed upon by representatives from both China and Japan in October of last year. After the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was signed on March 5th of this year, people from all walks of life in Japan generally expressed their welcome, but Kishi Nobusuke made a statement on the same day, expressing that he could not recognize it. After that, the Kishi Nobusuke government colluded with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group, exchanged secret letters, and repeatedly discussed and delayed, until April 9th, when it expressed its attitude towards the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. And this attitude is consistent with the Kishi Nobusuke government's consistent basic stance of hostility towards our country and obstruction and sabotage of Sino-Japanese trade.
    Japan is now facing a serious economic recession. In the past, although Kishi Nobusuke smiled obsequiously at the United States and emphasized "Japanese-American friendship" repeatedly, the United States government unceremoniously excluded Japanese goods, causing Japan's trade deficit with the United States to reach as much as 700 million US dollars in 1957. Now, as the economic recession in the United States intensifies, Japan's exports to the United States will not only be more difficult and subject to exclusion, but the economic recession in the United States will inevitably affect other capitalist countries, especially Japan. Therefore, Kishi Nobusuke, in the face of the increasingly deepening economic recession, is eager to gain from Sino-Japanese trade, and this idea is the origin of the Kishi Nobusuke government's lip service to "trade with China." At the same time, Japan will dissolve the Diet and hold general elections this year. In order to deceive voters, Kishi Nobusuke and his ruling party do not dare to excessively violate public opinion and blatantly say "no" on the Sino-Japanese trade issue. This is why the Kishi Nobusuke government had to ostensibly express "support" for the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. But in its heart, it is hostile to the Chinese people and stands with American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek group. Therefore, at a critical moment, it does not hesitate to openly reveal its true face of hostility towards the Chinese people and show its reactionary stance. The Kishi Nobusuke government thinks that adopting this double-dealing tactic may be able to dress itself up as a "perfect person" in Japanese parlance, which can both please the United States, curry favor with Chiang Kai-shek, and deceive the Chinese people, so as to achieve its plan to pursue one-sided interests. But his calculation is completely wrong.
    Today, the entire imperialism is heading towards decline. The Kishi Nobusuke government's attempt to play double-dealing tactics to achieve the aim of a potential imperialist ambition will not only not work in front of the Chinese people, but also make the people of other Asian countries more clearly recognize its true face and plunge Japan into the situation of an Asian orphan. This cleverness of thinking it is "perfectly adaptable" is actually just courting disaster.
    The Chinese people are willing to live in friendship with the Japanese people, and are also willing to see the continuous development of trade between China and Japan. The Chinese government has clearly expressed its welcome and support after the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The current problem lies entirely in the Kishi Nobusuke government's continued adherence to its attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people and undermining the implementation of the trade agreement. The Chinese people have always emphasized self-reliance, and have the fraternal support and cooperation of socialist countries; the United States' blockade and "embargo" have not been able to stop our economic construction. The correct path for Sino-Japanese trade can only be based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and established on the basis of mutual trust, mutual respect, and friendly exchanges. On the one hand, showing blatant hostility towards the Chinese people, and on the other hand, wanting to gain from Sino-Japanese trade, is definitely not possible.
    People from all walks of life and progressive parties in Japan have already raised accusations against the Kishi Nobusuke government's actions to sabotage the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. We fully understand this feeling and attitude of the Japanese people. We believe that the Japanese people will continue to work hard to break through the obstacles, and Sino-Japanese trade will continue to develop on the road of equality and mutual benefit, and friendship between the people.

### 再斥岸信介政府破坏中日贸易协定

    再斥岸信介政府破坏中日贸易协定
    日本首相岸信介4月9日关于第四次中日贸易协定的答复，以及日本内阁官房长官爱知揆一关于这个协定的谈话，充分暴露了日本政府破坏第四次中日贸易协定的本来面目。负责同中国签订第四次中日贸易协定的日本三团体，已经把日本政府的这个答复通知了中国国际贸易促进委员会。中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸在给日本三团体的复电中，表示断然拒绝接受日本政府的这个答复，并据理驳斥了岸信介的公开敌视我国的谰言，彻底揭穿了日本政府破坏第四次中日贸易协定的阴谋。我们完全支持中国国际贸易促进委员会所作的严正表示。
    第四次中日贸易协定是“为了进一步促进中、日两国间贸易的发展，加强中、日两国人民间的友谊，根据平等互利的原则”签订的。协定和它不可分割的备忘录的各项条款，也完全贯彻了对等的原则。这个精神，绝对不容歪曲。而岸信介的答复，哪里有一丝一毫平等互利的气味？哪里有一丝一毫“加强中日两国人民间的友谊”的气味？离开平等互利的原则，对中国人民满怀敌意，光想从中日贸易中捞上一把；从这里，我们不难闻到一股帝国主义的邪恶的气味。
    岸信介政府的答复，是什么意思呢？从爱知揆一为岸信介的答复进行注解的谈话中可以看得明白：就是要在“特权”问题上大作文章，借口援用日本国内法令，不给中国商务代表机构以安全保证，借口没有承认政府的事实，纵容蒋介石集团及日本军国主义分子侮辱中国国旗；而岸信介所说的“国际关系”，也显然是指日本政府同美国和蒋介石集团的关系。美国和蒋介石集团不仅敌视中日贸易，并且千方百计企图破坏我国，岸信介去年访问台湾的时候，就公开向蒋介石集团表示“反攻大陆非常之好”，这是举世周知的事实。
    在日本进行侵略战争期间，岸信介早就是制定帝国主义政策的老手。现在岸信介政府为其服务的日本垄断资本，仍然是建立在过去日本帝国主义时代的经济结构基础之上的，它在战后也是从朝鲜战争的血泊里，依靠美国的“特需”订货“繁荣”起来的。岸信介政府追随美国的备战政策，积极重整武装，正在用日本人民深恶痛绝的核武器装备“自卫队”，使日本军火工业可以从这里捞到了大量利润。岸信介政府为了给日本的畸形发展的工业开辟市场，为了给日本垄断资本的对外扩张铺平道路，还企图在“东南亚开发基金”、“亚洲市场”等等新招牌下，重建“大东亚共荣圈”。对国内，它更积极准备修改宪法，加紧镇压和平民主势力，复活军国主义教育和加强对教育的控制。这些，都使人感到一股潜在的帝国主义暗流正在日本蠢蠢欲动。
    岸信介政府根据这种潜在的扩张政策的立场，对中国人民一贯采取了敌视态度，原是不足奇怪的。且不说岸信介追随美国进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋、窝藏所谓“台湾独立同盟”的廖文毅集团分子、制造“台湾复归日本”舆论的帝国主义野心等等；就从中日贸易问题来看，岸信介政府上台以来，也是极尽其阻挠和破坏之能事的。
    曾经由日本前任首相鸠山一郎表示支持和协助的第三次中日贸易协定，就由于岸信介政府的阻挠和破坏没有能够完全实施。第三次贸易协定在去年5月满期以后，岸信介政府先是借口指纹问题，后来又在限制商务代表机构人数上横加阻难，致使第四次中日贸易协定迟迟不能签订。今年2月，在日本人民和工商界的强烈指责下，岸信介不得不勉强同意日本三团体代表前来我国签订第四次贸易协定，但同时又横生枝节地提出“谅解事项”四条，企图篡改早在去年10月已由中日双方代表一致同意的协定草案和备忘录的内容。第四次中日贸易协定在今年3月5日签订以后，日本各界人士普遍表示欢迎，岸信介当天却发表谈话，表示不能承认。在这以后，岸信介政府又同美国和蒋介石集团勾勾搭搭，密信往还，几经商量，一再拖延，直到4月9日才表示了它对第四次中日贸易协定的态度。而这个态度，同岸信介政府历来敌视我国、阻挠和破坏中日贸易的基本立场是一致的。
    日本现在正面临着严重的经济衰退局面。过去，尽管岸信介对美国满脸陪笑，口口声声强调“日美友谊”，可是美国政府排斥日货却毫不留情，使日本1957年对美国的贸易入超达七亿美元之多。现在在美国经济衰退日趋严重的情况下，日本对美出口不仅将更加困难，遭到排斥，而且美国的经济衰退也必然要影响其他资本主义国家，尤其是日本。因此，岸信介在日益深刻化的经济衰退中，亟图从中日贸易中捞一把，这种想法就是岸信介政府口头上弹唱“对华贸易”的由来。同时，日本今年将解散国会，举行大选，岸信介和他的执政党，为了骗取选票，也不敢过分违背民心，在中日贸易问题上明目张胆地说个“不”字。这就是为什么岸信介政府表面上不得不表示“支持”第四次中日贸易协定的原因。但是它在骨子里却是敌视中国人民，与美帝国主义、蒋介石集团站在一道的。所以，他在紧要关头就不惜公然露出敌视中国人民的真正面目，表明它的反动立场。岸信介政府以为采取这种两面三刀的手法也许可以把自己打扮成日本话所说的“八方美人”，既能取媚美国、讨好蒋介石，又能蒙混中国人民的耳目，实现其追求片面利益的打算。但是他的算盘是彻底打错了。
    今天，整个帝国主义都在走向没落。岸信介政府企图玩弄两面三刀的手法来达到潜在的帝国主义野心的目的，不仅在中国人民面前行不通，而且也将使其他亚洲国家人民更加认清它的真正面目，陷日本于亚洲的孤儿的境地。这种自以为“八面玲珑”的聪明，其实不过是自找绝路。
    中国人民愿意同日本人民友好相处，也愿意看到中日两国间的贸易不断发展。中国政府在第四次中日贸易协定签订后，已经明确表示了欢迎和支持的态度。目前的问题，完全在于岸信介政府继续坚持敌视中国人民的态度，破坏贸易协定的实施。中国人民一向强调自力更生，而且有社会主义国家兄弟般的支持和协作；美国的封锁“禁运”，并没有能够阻挡住我们的经济建设。中日贸易的正确道路，只能是根据平等互利的原则，建立在彼此信赖，互相尊重，友好往来的基础上。一面对中国人民显示出露骨的敌意，一面想从中日贸易中捞一把，那是肯定办不到的。
    日本各界人士和进步党派已经对岸信介政府破坏第四次中日贸易协定的行为，纷纷提出责难。我们是充分了解日本人民的这种感情和态度的。我们相信，日本人民会继续努力，突破阻碍，中日贸易将在平等互利、人民友好的道路上不断发展起来。
