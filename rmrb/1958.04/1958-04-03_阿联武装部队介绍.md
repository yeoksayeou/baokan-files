Introduction to the Armed Forces of the United Arab Republic

    Following the establishment of the United Arab Republic on February 1 this year, the armies of Egypt and Syria have been merged into the Armed Forces of the United Arab Republic, with Marshal Amir, the former Egyptian Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief, as the commander-in-chief.

    The Armed Forces of the United Arab Republic have made significant contributions to the national independence movements of Egypt and Syria. As early as World War II, many young officers in the Egyptian army fought against the British occupation forces and the corrupt rule of King Farouk. In February 1942, they formed the "Free Officers Organization" in Cairo, which quickly spread to all branches of the Egyptian army. In July 1952, the "Free Officers Organization," led by Nasser, launched a military coup, forcing King Farouk to abdicate. In June 1953, they announced the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Egyptian Republic. After overthrowing the feudal dynasty, the Egyptian army continued to take on the task of fighting against British imperialism and striving for complete independence. Through the joint efforts with the people of the whole country, in June 1956, they finally forced the British to completely withdraw their troops who had occupied Egypt for seventy-four years.

    But soon after the Egyptian government nationalized the Suez Canal Company, British and French imperialists colluded with Israel to attack Egypt. The Egyptian army fought very bravely and tenaciously in repelling the tripartite aggression of Britain, France, and Israel. For example, the two infantry battalions guarding the city of Abu Ageila in the northern Sinai Peninsula were surrounded by an Israeli armored brigade and an infantry brigade for two days and nights, yet they persisted in fighting. Finally, they successfully broke through, killing and wounding more than 400 enemy soldiers. The heroic resistance of the Egyptian army, coupled with the support of peace-loving people all over the world, finally forced the aggressors to accept a truce. The Anglo-French war of aggression against Egypt ended in a shameful defeat.

    The Syrian army also grew up in the struggle for national independence and anti-imperialism. In 1945, the Syrian people launched a vigorous anti-French struggle to demand the withdrawal of French occupation troops. Many local Syrian troops revolted and joined the people's anti-French movement. In 1946, the French occupation troops were forced to withdraw from Syria. Syria gained independence. The Syrian army was expanded under such historical conditions. In 1956, when Britain, France, and Israel jointly invaded Egypt, the Syrian people and army cut off the oil pipeline of the Iraq Petroleum Company, which was mainly capitalized by the British, bringing great threat to imperialism and strongly supporting the Egyptian people's resistance. Last autumn, the United States instigated Turkey to deploy troops on the Turkish-Syrian border, preparing to launch a large-scale attack on Syria. Under the threat of overwhelming military pressure, the Syrian army, together with the people, prepared to fight. At this time, Egypt also sent its own troops to defend alongside the Syrian army, coupled with the solemn warning issued by the Soviet Union to the United States and Turkey, so that the aggressors had to finally abandon their plan to invade Syria.

    After the Suez Canal War, the armies of Egypt and Syria have listed opposing imperialist aggression as their top priority. In the past year or so, they have greatly strengthened the strength of their armies, strengthened the training of their armies, improved the tactical and technical level of their armies, and at the same time strengthened the construction of military industries. It is certain that after the merger of these two armies into one armed force, it will play a more important role in safeguarding the independence of the Arab nation and resisting imperialist aggression in the Middle East.

    阿联武装部队介绍
    今年2月1日阿拉伯联合共和国成立后，埃及和叙利亚的军队已合并成阿拉伯联合共和国武装部队，总司令是原埃及国防部长兼总司令阿密尔元帅。
    阿拉伯联合共和国武装部队对埃及和叙利亚的民族独立运动都有过重大的贡献。早在第二次世界大战期间，埃及军队就有不少青年军官为反对英国占领军和法鲁克国王的腐朽统治而进行斗争。1942年2月，他们在开罗组成“自由军官组织”，很快就分布到埃及军队的各兵种。1952年7月，“自由军官组织”在纳赛尔的领导下发动了军事政变，强迫法鲁克国王退位；1953年6月，又宣布废除君主政体，成立埃及共和国。在推翻封建王朝统治后，埃及军队继续担负起反对英国帝国主义和争取完全独立的斗争任务，经过与全国人民的共同努力，在1956年6月终于迫使英国全部撤走了占领埃及达七十四年之久的英军。
    但不久，当埃及政府把苏伊士运河公司收归国有后，英、法帝国主义又勾结以色列进攻埃及。埃及军队在反击英、法、以三国侵略中，表现十分英勇顽强。如在西奈半岛北部据守阿布·阿韦吉拉城的两个步兵营，遭到以色列军队一个装甲旅和一个步兵旅包围两昼夜，仍坚持作战，最后成功地突围，还毙伤了敌军四百多人。埃及军队的英勇抗战，加上全世界爱好和平人民的支援，终于迫使侵略者不得不接受停战。英、法发动的侵埃战争就以可耻的失败而告终。
    叙利亚军队也是在争取民族独立和反帝的斗争中成长起来的。1945年，叙利亚人民为了要求法国撤退占领军，掀起了轰轰烈烈的反法斗争，许多叙利亚的地方军队纷纷起义，参加了人民的反法运动。1946年，法国占领军被迫撤出了叙利亚。叙利亚获得了独立。叙利亚军队就在这样的历史条件下扩建起来。1956年，当英、法、以三国联合侵略埃及时，叙利亚人民和军队曾把英国占主要资本的伊拉克石油公司的过境油管予以切断，给帝国主义带来很大的威胁，有力地支持了埃及人民的抗战。去年秋季，美国曾策动土耳其陈兵土、叙边境，准备大举进攻叙利亚。在大军压境的威胁下，叙利亚军队与人民一起，准备应战。这时，埃及也派出了自己的军队，与叙军并肩防守，加以苏联向美、土提出严正警告，使侵略者不得不最后放弃了侵略叙利亚的计划。
    苏伊士运河战争后，埃及和叙利亚两国的军队，已把反对帝国主义侵略列为他们的头等任务。他们在一年多来已大大增强了军队的实力，加强了对军队的训练，提高了军队的战术和技术水平，同时还在加强军事工业的建设。可以肯定，这两支军队合并为一支武装力量以后，对维护阿拉伯民族独立和抵制帝国主义对中东的侵略活动，将起到更为重要的作用。
