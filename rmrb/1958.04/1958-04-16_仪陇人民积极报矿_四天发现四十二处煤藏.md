    Yilong People Actively Report Mineral Deposits
    Forty-Two Coal Deposits Discovered in Four Days
    The people of Yilong County, Sichuan, have found forty-two coal deposits, some of which have already begun trial mining.
    In early March, the masses in Yilong County began to report mineral deposits. In four days, the people of the county reported forty-two coal mines. Trial mining has begun in four places across the county. In Yanshanzhai, Jiangjun Township, a coal seam was discovered in a tunnel driven three meters into the mountain, and more than 900 jin have been mined in just a few days. In Mao'ershan, Sanwen Township, Nantou District, a coal seam was found after digging just over one meter, and more than 2,000 jin have been mined recently.
    In addition to coal mines, the county also discovered two sulfur deposits. In Fengyi Township alone, the Nanchong Special District exploration team confirmed that the amount of sulfur deposits exceeds 400 tons. A sulfur mine in Yilu Township, Ma'an District, has a very large area. Both of these sites will be mined within this year.

    仪陇人民积极报矿
    四天发现四十二处煤藏
    四川仪陇县人民找出了四十二处煤藏，有的已开始试采。
    3月上旬，仪陇县的群众开始报矿，四天时间，全县群众就报了煤矿四十二处。全县有四处开始试采。将军乡沿山寨在掘进三公尺的山洞中，就发现有了煤层，几天时间，就采了九百多斤。南图区的三蚊乡猫儿山，才掘进一公尺多，又找出了煤层，最近已挖了二千多斤。
    这个县除煤矿外，还发现了两处硫磺矿藏。仅凤仪乡一处，据南充专区探察队探察证实蕴藏的硫磺量达四百吨以上，马鞍区的义路乡一处硫磺矿面积很大，这两处今年内即将开采。
