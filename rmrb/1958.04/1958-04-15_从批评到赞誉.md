    From Criticism to Praise
    Bai Yao
    During the rectification movement, the relationship between cadres and the masses has greatly improved. The news from Huangjin Township in Gan County, Jiangxi Province, provides a concrete example in this regard. The relationship between cadres and the masses in this township used to be very poor, but now it is very good. If we compare the two situations before and after, we can see how obvious this change is.
    We often say that revolutionary work is work to serve the people, and all revolutionary cadres are servants of the people. Thousands upon thousands of revolutionary cadres truly understand their work and their position in revolutionary work in this way. They truly practice what they preach and have established close ties with the masses. However, there are also many comrades who, despite saying so, still see themselves as special in their hearts and are full of official airs in front of the masses, making it difficult to get along with them on an equal footing. What they say must be "obeyed" by the masses; what the masses say is not necessarily "listened to." In this way, the distance between the two sides becomes greater and greater, and it is naturally impossible to establish a close relationship. Now, we are carrying out rectification, and officialdom is one of the objects we oppose. We must dig out this root from the depths of our minds.
    More comrades do not have the concept of "cadres are officials" in their minds. They subjectively hope to be honest servants of the people. However, because the working methods are improper, the opposite effect is often achieved. Take the cadres of Huangjin Township as an example. In the past, they often held mass meetings at night and made long reports that often dragged on until late at night. They may have thought that this would explain the problem thoroughly and enable the masses to have a deeper understanding. Unexpectedly, it was precisely this that affected the masses' rest after labor and aroused the masses' legitimate dissatisfaction. There are many similar examples in the work. Therefore, it is not enough to have good wishes. If the working method is not right, this good wish is only a "wish" and will not play any effective role in promoting actual work and connecting with the masses.
    The experience of Huangjin Township tells us that as long as cadres can change their work style, the relationship with the masses can be close. Comrade Zhou Xiaohong was criticized by the masses in the past as "like a Kuomintang township chief," but is now praised by the masses as "truly a people's township chief." This fact is worth pondering by all comrades who have problems with their thinking and work style.

    从批评到赞誉
    白遥
    在整风运动中，干部和群众的关系有了极大的改善。江西赣县黄金乡的新闻，在这方面提供了一个具体的例证。这个乡的干部和群众关系，过去很不好，现在很好，如果将前后两种情况对比一下，可以看出，这是如何明显的一种变化。
    我们常说，革命工作是为人民服务的工作，一切革命干部都是人民的勤务员。千千万万的革命干部确实是这样的理解自己的工作，理解自己在革命工作中的地位，他们真正身体力行，和群众建立了密切的联系。可是，也有不少同志，他们口头上尽管也会这样说，但在思想深处，却自视特殊，在群众面前，官气十足，很难以平等地位相处。自己说的话，群众必须“照办”；群众说的话，不一定“听取”。这样，双方距离越来越远，自然不能够建立密切的关系了。现在，我们正在进行整风，官气正是我们反对的对象之一，我们必须从思想深处把这个根挖出来。
    更多的同志在思想上并没有什么“干部者，即官也”的概念，他们主观上也还是希望老老实实地做一个人民的勤务员。不过，因为工作方法不妥当，往往收到了相反的效果。即以黄金乡的干部为例，过去晚上开群众大会，做长报告经常拖至深夜。他们也许以为，这样可以把问题讲透彻，使群众有较深刻的了解。想不到，正是由于这一点，影响了群众劳动之后的休息，引起了群众正当的不满。类似这样的例子，在工作中是不少的。所以，尽管有良好的愿望还是不够的，如果工作方法不对头，这个良好的愿望也仅是“愿望”而已，并不会在推进实际工作和联系群众方面发生什么有效的作用。
    黄金乡的经验告诉我们：只要干部能够转变作风，和群众的关系一定可以密切起来。周孝宏同志过去被群众批评为“像国民党乡长”，现在被群众赞誉为“真正一个人民的乡长”。这个事实，值得一切思想作风有毛病的同志深思。
