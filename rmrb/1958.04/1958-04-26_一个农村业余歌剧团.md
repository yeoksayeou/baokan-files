    A Rural Amateur Opera Troupe
    By our reporter Liu Peheng

    In the clubhouse of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Yongfengtun Township, at the foot of the Western Hills of Beijing, a rural amateur opera troupe is rehearsing its first self-created play, "The Young Old Man." This play was written by the troupe's writing group based on real people and events that occurred in the township during the Great Debate. It depicts the ideological transformation of an old woman after the socialist Great Debate. Self-creation and self-performance are new achievements made by this troupe in the Great Leap Forward.

    This amateur opera troupe has been performing continuously since its establishment in November 1949. The biggest characteristic of its performances is close integration with central tasks and political movements. In movements and central tasks such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, resistance against America and aid to Korea, unified purchase and sale, agricultural collectivization, and general elections, they have performed more than 70 plays such as "The White-Haired Girl," "Turning Back is the Shore," "Volunteer Army," "Beat the Beasts to Protect Peace," "Compete to be a Model in Grain Delivery," "After the Autumn Harvest," and "Cherish the Right to Vote," which not only promoted the work but also educated the members of the cooperative. At the beginning of the unified purchase and sale, a woman surnamed Wang did not understand the policy well. Village cadres mobilized her several times, but she said that there was no surplus grain at home. After she watched the opera "Compete to be a Model in Grain Delivery," she understood the principle of unified purchase and sale and immediately sold 200 jin of surplus grain.

    This troupe performs operas, plays, and Peking operas. The content of their performances is fresh and reflects real life, so the peasants love to watch their performances. Many places invite them to perform. The troupe has performed in Liangjiadian, Liulitun, Shahe and other places. Farmers in Yongtaizhuang, more than 20 li away, also invited them to perform. After a unit of the First Ministry of Machine Building invited them to perform plays such as "New Countryside," "Enemies Without Guns," and "Quick Literacy Method," they invited them a second time to perform plays such as "Enemies Without Guns."

    Another characteristic of the troupe is that it runs the troupe diligently and frugally, spends less money, performs more plays, and enriches people's cultural life without asking the cooperative for a penny of subsidy. At present, this troupe has several curtains, two sets of scenery, and some props. These "properties" were bought by the actors with money earned from voluntary labor such as smashing stones. Some small pistols, submachine guns, hoes and other props were made by the actors with scrap iron and wood. Some of the cosmetics used by the actors are self-prepared. They maintain the simple style of the countryside and never pursue stage splendor or blindly purchase costumes and props. The tables, chairs, and props used in the performances are borrowed from the peasants. Because they like this troupe, some old ladies even brought the rouge they bought when they were young and gave it to the troupe.

    This year, the troupe has further clarified the direction of running the troupe by the masses. Not only should it spend less money and perform more plays, but also mobilize the masses to engage in creation and strive to achieve self-creation and self-performance. They proposed that they would create more than 100 operas and plays this year, and also write more than 200 pieces of clapper talk, plays, cross-talk, Shandong kuaishu, and so on. They are working hard to further improve the quality of their performances and acting skills.

    一个农村业余歌剧团
    本报记者　刘佩珩
    在北京西山脚下永丰屯乡曙光农业社的俱乐部里，农村业余歌剧团正在排练自己创作的第一个剧本“年青的老人”。这个戏是剧团创作小组根据本乡在大辩论中发生的真人真事写成的，它描写了社会主义大辩论后一个老太太思想转变的情况。自编自演是这个剧团在跃进中取得的新收获。
    这个业余歌剧团从1949年11月建立，直到现在没有间断过演出。演出的最大特点是密切结合中心工作和政治运动。他们在土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝、统购统销、农业合作化、普选等运动和中心工作中，演出了“白毛女”、“回头是岸”、“志愿军”、“打死野兽保和平”、“交粮争模范”、“秋收之后”、“爱护选举权”等七十多个剧目，不仅推动了工作，而且也教育了社员。在统购统销开始时，一个姓王的妇女对政策了解不够，村干部几次动员她，她都说家里没余粮。当她看了“交粮争模范”歌剧后，了解了统购统销的道理，马上卖了余粮二百斤。
    这个剧团演歌剧，也演话剧，也演过京剧。他们演出的内容新鲜，反映了现实生活，所以农民很爱看他们演出的戏，许多地方都请他们去演出。剧团在亮甲店、六里屯、沙河等地都演出过戏。二十多里外的永泰庄农民们，也请他们去演戏。第一机械工业部的一个单位在请他们演出“新农村”、“不拿枪的敌人”、“速成识字法”等剧后，第二次又去约他们演出“不拿枪的敌人”等剧。
    剧团的另一特点是勤俭办团，少花钱，多排戏，既不要社里补助一文钱，又丰富了人们的文化生活。目前这个剧团有几块幕布、二套片景和一些道具。这些“家产”都是演员们用砸石子等义务劳动挣回来的钱买的。一些小手枪、冲锋枪、锄头等道具都是演员们用废铁片、木头作成的。演员们用的化妆品，有的是个人自备的。他们保持农村的纯朴作风，从不追求舞台上的华丽，盲目的购买服装道具。演出时用的桌椅道具都是向农民借用的。因为喜欢这个剧团，有的老太太甚至把年轻时买的胭脂拿来送给剧团用。
    这个剧团在今年更明确了群众办团的方向，不仅少花钱，多演戏，还要发动群众搞创作，争取做到自编自演。他们提出今年内要自己创作歌舞、话剧本一百多个，还要编写快板、话剧、相声、山东快书等二百多件。他们正在为进一步提高演出质量和演技水平而努力。
