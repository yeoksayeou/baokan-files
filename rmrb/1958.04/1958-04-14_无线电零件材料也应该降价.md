    Radio Component Materials Should Also Be Reduced in Price
    Seeing the news in the newspaper that the price of radios has been reduced is truly gratifying. However, although the price of radios has been reduced this time, the price of radio component materials has not been correspondingly reduced. For example, a five-tube radio sells for 104 yuan on the market, while buying a set of component materials also costs about 104 yuan. For amateur radio enthusiasts, in addition to the interest of experimentation and research, they also hope that the radios they assemble themselves will be cheaper than commercially available products. Now that the price of component materials is the same as finished products, I think it is unreasonable, and I hope the relevant departments will consider it.　	Dong Zhirong

    无线电零件材料也应该降价
    看到报上登载收音机降低售价的消息，确实使人高兴。但是，这次收音机的价格虽然降价了，无线电零件材料却未相应的跟着减价。例如：市场上一架五灯收音机卖一百零四元，而购买一套零件材料也需一百零四元左右。对于业余无线电爱好者来说，除了实验研究的兴趣之外，还希望自己动手装的收音机要比市售成品便宜一些。现在零件材料与成品一样价格，我觉得不合理，希望有关部门考虑。　	董志容
