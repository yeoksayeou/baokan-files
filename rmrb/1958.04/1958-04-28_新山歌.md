New folk song, thinking of the past, tears of sorrow, nine out of ten families starved and suffered, the Zhuang households' fields and gardens grew weeds, families fled to escape famine, no one cared about enduring hunger and suffering, the landlords were in control of our village. Looking at today, full of joy, fish fill the ponds, lotus roots fill the ponds, every household raises pigs, old and young all have new clothes, stepping up the stairs step by step, life is getting better year by year.

    新山歌想从前，泪悲伤，十家九户饿断肠，庄户田园长野草，携家带眷去逃荒，忍饥挨饿无人问，地主掌握在咱乡。看现在，喜洋洋，鱼满池，藕满塘，家家户户把猪养，老少都有新衣裳，脚踏楼梯步步高，生活一年比一年强。
            （河北永清）
