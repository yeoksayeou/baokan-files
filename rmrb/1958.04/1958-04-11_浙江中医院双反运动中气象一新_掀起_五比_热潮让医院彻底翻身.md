    Zhejiang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital: New Atmosphere in the "Double-Anti" Movement, Launching a "Five-Comparison" Upsurge to Completely Transform the Hospital

    (Our report) To ensure a complete turnaround in the Zhejiang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, both politically and professionally, the entire staff has recently undertaken sweeping reforms during this rectification movement. Guided by the principle of "everything for the patient," they aim to eliminate thought patterns, work styles, rules, and regulations that are detrimental to patients and the people's cause. Currently, the hospital presents a revitalized atmosphere with rising righteousness and a completely new look.

    The Zhejiang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital is a provincial-level comprehensive hospital with 343 staff members, including Chinese and Western medical personnel and administrative staff, and 180 beds. The rectification movement has uncovered numerous issues. It revealed the widespread tendencies in general hospitals to emphasize professional work over political ideology, inpatient care over outpatient services, research over treatment, and to pursue perfection, novelty, extravagance, and waste. It also exposed the serious pursuit of personal fame and gain and bourgeois work styles among some staff members, as well as breaking down the old work styles of intellectuals who were obsessed with "face." Over the years, the bourgeois remnants in the minds of the hospital staff have not been thoroughly transformed, and the hospital's rules and regulations, which are detrimental to patients, are very prominent. For example, closing the outpatient clinic for three afternoons each week for staff study and departmental activities has become a legitimate system. Whenever the hospital has temporary, hospital-wide activities, they hang a wooden sign outside the gate that reads "Outpatient services suspended." Patients who have made appointments or traveled long distances for treatment have no choice but to return home without being seen. Staff members, for their own convenience, wake patients up before dawn to carry out morning ward care. Many doctors, wanting to become famous experts, are unwilling to do general outpatient work. For example, this hospital has a total of sixteen internal medicine doctors, but sometimes only two or three participate in outpatient services. As a result, patients who could have been treated on the same day are delayed for five or six days. Some staff members also have a serious "big-shot" mentality, emphasizing the hospital's special status and demanding complete, high-quality, and new equipment. Whatever other hospitals in the province have, they try to buy, regardless of whether it is currently needed. In this way, the state subsidized more than 70,000 yuan last year alone. The hospital's arrogance is also reflected in consultations with fraternal hospitals, not adopting an attitude of friendship, mutual research, and common improvement to provide care to the patients.

    After the launch of the "Double-Anti" movement, the awakened masses wrote big-character posters overnight, boldly exposing the above-mentioned problems existing in the hospital and demanding thorough reform. Two nurses in the surgical ward took the lead in creating a rapid bed-making method, which not only doubled work efficiency but also ensured quality. The eight staff members in the outpatient registration, billing, and accounting departments came up with a way to work together in one location, which not only reduced patient travel but also reduced the staff by three. At this time, a strong atmosphere of learning from the advanced, striving for advancement, and catching up with the advanced was stirred up throughout the hospital, and people competed to demonstrate their workload, tap their potential, make detailed calculations, think of solutions, and offer suggestions to improve work. The hospital's Party branch seized the opportunity to highlight the people and events that broke the norm and achieved leaps forward, helped them summarize their experiences, and held on-site meetings and on-site exchanges. Finally, they formulated a leap-forward staffing plan for the hospital. After ten days of practice, this plan not only proved that it was possible to extract more than 100 people to support rural schistosomiasis prevention and control work, but also that with the staff reduced to more than 220 people, the hospital's beds could still be increased to 260, and each ward also added simple beds. In addition, under the premise of reducing the standards of outpatient, inpatient, and medical fees, and in accordance with the spirit of diligence and frugality in running the hospital, it was also proposed to ensure that the hospital's income and expenditure are balanced and that the state will not be subsidized throughout the year.

    In order to consolidate the achievements already made and promote the continued progress of the movement, the hospital, while formulating departmental work rules and individual red-and-expert plans, launched an unprecedented comparison of service attitude, improvement of work efficiency, medical quality, unity of medical staff and workers, and a contest to see who is first to become red and expert, deeply red and expert. Their general slogan is: Let the hospital undergo a thorough transformation in political ideology and professional work. They also proposed five guarantees, including diligence and frugality in running the hospital, reforming the medical system, and establishing a wholehearted service for the people, and challenged fraternal hospitals throughout the province and the country.

    浙江中医院双反运动中气象一新
    掀起“五比”热潮让医院彻底翻身
    本报讯　浙江中医院在这次整风中，为了使医院在政治思想上和业务上来个彻底大翻身。全院职工最近大刀阔斧地进行整改，要在“一切为了病人”的思想指导下，把那些不利于病人和人民事业的思想作风、规章制度烧光。目前，医院已呈现正气上升，面貌焕然一新的气象。
    浙江中医院是省属综合性的医院，有中西医务和行政工作人员三百四十三人，设有病床一百八十张。在这次整风运动中揭发出来的问题很多。揭发了一般医院中普遍存在的重业务、轻政治，重病房、轻门诊，重研究、轻治疗，以及求全求新、铺张浪费等倾向。还揭露了有些工作人员严重的个人名利思想和资产阶级的工作作风，以及打破了知识分子爱面子的旧作风。几年来，医院中工作人员的资产阶级残余思想没有彻底改造，那些不利于病人的院章制度就很突出。如为了工作人员学习和科室活动，每星期停诊三个下午的门诊工作已成了合法的制度。医院遇有全院性的临时活动，他们就在大门外挂上块木牌“停止门诊”，预约好的或远道赶来就医的病人，医院不看也只得回家。工作人员为了自己方便，天未大亮，就把病人喊醒，进行病房晨间护理工作。不少医师想成名当专家，就不愿做一般的门诊工作。如这个医院共有十六个内科医师，但参加门诊工作的有时只有两三个人。这样，本来在当天就可以诊病的病人，也都拖延了五、六天。有些工作人员阔气、骄气的老大思想也很严重，强调医院特殊，设备要求全、求好、求新，凡是省内其他医院有的，不管目前是否需要，总得千方百计地去买来。这样，仅去年国家就补贴了七万多元。医院的骄气，也表现在同兄弟医院相互之间对病人的会诊，不是采取友谊、相互研究共同提高的态度上。
    双反运动开始后，觉悟了的群众连夜写大字报，大胆地揭露了医院内存在的上述各方面的问题，要求彻底改革。外科病房两个护士首先创造了快速铺床法，不仅工作效率提高了一倍而且也保证了质量。门诊挂号、收费、记账处的八个工作人员想出了搬在一起办公的办法，不但减少了病人跑路，而且还可以缩减工作人员三人。这时，全院上下左右掀起了学先进、争先进、赶先进的空气，纷纷地摆工作量，挖潜力，算细账，想办法，出主意来改进工作。医院党支部就抓住突破常规、跃进的人物和事例，帮助总结经验，召开现场会议、现场交流。最后制订了医院工作人员跃进的编制方案。这个方案经过十天的实践，不仅证明可以抽出一百多人去支援农村血吸虫病防治工作，而且在人员缩减至二百二十多人，医院的病床仍然可以扩增至二百六十张，并且每病区还增设了简易病床。此外，在降低门诊、住院和医药收费标准的前提下，根据勤俭办院的精神，还提出了：做到医院收支平衡，全年不要国家补贴的保证。
    为了巩固已得成果，推动运动继续前进，医院在制订科室工作细则、个人红专规划的同时，又掀起了一个空前的比服务态度、比提高工作效率、比医疗质量、比医护工团结、比谁先红先专、红透专深的评比热潮。他们的总口号是：让医院在政治思想上、业务上来个彻底大翻身。他们还提出了勤俭办院、改革医疗制度、树立全心全意为人民服务等五项保证，向全省和全国兄弟医院挑战。　（屠正峰）
