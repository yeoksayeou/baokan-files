Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 13th: The Special Congress of the Communist Party of India passed a political resolution on the evening of April 12th in Amritsar.

At the April 13th session of the Special Congress, Ajoy Ghosh was re-elected as General Secretary, and the Congress also elected 101 members to the National Committee.

The political resolution passed on the 12th reviewed the major international and domestic situations since the Indian Communist Party's Palghat Congress two years ago. The resolution stated: "Events in our country since our Party's Palghat Congress have fully confirmed the correctness of the analysis made by the Party and the policies it prescribed."

The resolution said: "The Communist Party supports the Indian government's foreign policy and will consistently strive to strengthen this policy." "India's independent foreign policy has aroused the hostility of imperialists and made them plot conspiracies against our country."

The resolution also stated that in India, "the masses have become increasingly radicalized," and the democratic movement has been further strengthened. The democratic movement reached its peak in Kerala.

Referring to India's Second Five-Year Plan, the resolution stated, "In the third year of the plan, the pace of development is not accelerating, but rather tending to slow down." Extremely reactionary forces have seized upon the difficulties encountered by the plan to intensify their activities. These reactionary forces openly advocate an open-door policy towards the influx of foreign capital, especially American capital. "This is an extremely dangerous tendency" because "the current recession in the United States is a warning to us not to make our national economy unilaterally dependent on the economy of imperialist countries."

The resolution further stated, "The Communist Party advocates the unreserved realization of the goals of the Second Five-Year Plan," and advocates "further strengthening economic cooperation between India and the socialist countries for the common benefit. In view of the American recession, this has become particularly urgent today."

The resolution put forward a ten-point program to be implemented immediately through a nationwide movement, including the democratic realization of the goals of the (Five-Year) Plan, opposition to the penetration of American capital, nationalization of large banks and wholesale food trade, expansion of state-owned trade, establishment of state control over British and Indian monopoly capital, revision and democratic implementation of land reform laws, full assistance to farmers and the adoption of development measures to increase agricultural production, safeguarding and expanding the democratic rights of the people, addressing the food crisis and the Party's recommendations for resolving it, opposing increased taxes and higher prices, supporting the holding of a summit conference, a second Bandung Conference, a halt to nuclear testing, and solidarity with Indonesia and Algeria, etc.

The resolution particularly emphasized the work of establishing mass organizations. It announced that the Communist Party would intensify its efforts to unite all patriotic and democratic forces within all parties. The resolution concluded: "The realization of these democratic tasks and the cause of national progress depend on whether the Communist Party can become a mass political force."

Prior to this, the Congress passed the new Party Constitution on the afternoon of April 9th.

The new Party Constitution consists of thirty-five articles, stipulating that the National Committee composed of 101 members will replace the current Central Committee. The current Politburo will be replaced by the Central Executive Committee composed of twenty-five members. This committee will include the Central Secretariat, including the General Secretary. The Central Executive Committee is elected by the National Committee.

    印共特别代表大会
    通过政治决议和新党章
    高士重新当选为总书记
    据新华社新德里13日电　印度共产党特别代表大会4月12日晚上在阿姆利则通过了政治决议。
    在特别代表大会4月13日会议上，高士重新当选为总书记，大会并选出了一百零一名全国委员会委员。
    12日通过的政治决议回顾了两年前印度共产党帕尔加特代表大会以来的重大的国际和国内局势。决议说：“自从我党帕尔加特代表大会以来，我国发生的事件完全证实了党所作的分析以及党所规定的方针的正确性。”
    决议说：“共产党支持印度政府的外交政策，并且将始终不渝地为加强这个政策而努力。”“印度的这种独立的外交政策引起了帝国主义者的敌视，并使他们策划对我国的阴谋”。
    决议又说，在印度，“群众已日益急进化”，民主运动已经进一步加强。民主运动在喀拉拉邦达到了高峰。
    决议在谈到印度第二个五年计划时说，“在计划的第三年，发展的速度不是加快，而是有放慢的趋势了。”极端反动势力抓住了计划所遇到的困难，加紧他们的活动。这些反动势力竟公开地主张对外国特别是美国的资本的入侵采取门户开放政策。“这是极其危险的倾向”，因为“目前美国的衰退就是一个警告，要我们不使我们的国民经济单方面地依赖帝国主义国家的经济。”
    决议又说，“共产党主张不折不扣地实现第二个五年计划的目标”，主张“为了共同的利益进一步加强印度同各社会主义国家间的经济合作。鉴于美国的衰退，这在今天变得尤其迫切了”。
    决议提出了立即以全国性运动来贯彻的十点纲领，其中包括以民主的方式实现（五年）计划的目标，反对美国资本的渗入，大银行和粮食批发贸易的国有化，扩大国营贸易，确立国家对英国和印度垄断资本的控制，修改土地改革法并以民主方式来实现，充分帮助农民并采取开发的措施以求增加农业产量，维护并扩大人民的民主权利，粮食危机和党对解决粮食危机问题的建议，反对增加赋税和提高物价，拥护举行最高级会议，第二次万隆会议，停止核试验，声援印度尼西亚和阿尔及利亚等等。
    决议特别强调建立群众组织的工作。它宣布，共产党将加紧努力，团结一切党派内的一切爱国民主力量。决议最后说：“这些民主任务的实现和国家进步的事业都要看共产党能否成为群众性的政治力量”。
    在这以前，大会在4月9日下午通过了新党章。
    新党章共分三十五条，它规定以一百零一名委员组成的全国委员会代替现在的中央委员会。目前的政治局由二十五名委员组成的中央执行委员会代替。这个委员会将包括有总书记在内的中央书记处。中央执行委员会由全国委员会选出。
