    Unveiling the Secrets of Coal
    Professor Zhuang Qianding of the Department of Power Engineering at Tsinghua University has recently completed a study on "The Unveiling of Coal's Properties and Its Industrial Applications" after more than a year of effort.
    This research has significant scientific value. It has found conclusions that scholars from various countries have failed to find for a century and will play a significant role in China's current industrial production. In this research, Professor Zhuang Qianding found the "Simplified Characteristic Coefficient B′ of Coal" representing all the mysteries of coal. Using it for coal classification, as long as there is elemental analysis data, he can use his suggested double-coordinate graph. This can save a lot of experimental work on caking properties, and at the same time, it is convenient for prospecting minerals, planning coal mining, and selecting appropriate coal.
    When Professor Zhuang Qianding discussed this research with Titz, a coal characteristic expert at the Institute of Combustible Minerals of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the inventor of the Titz method for testing coal caking properties, Titz believed that this was a new discovery. Titz used the original data of coal produced in Donbass and Kuznetsk to conduct further verification, and the results confirmed that Zhuang Qianding's coal classification method could also classify Soviet coal. Zhuang Qianding used coal data from the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and other countries to verify his coal classification method, and the results proved that it was completely applicable.

    揭露煤的秘密
    清华大学动力系庄前鼎教授经过一年多努力，在最近完成了“煤的特性的揭露及其在工业上的应用”的研究。
    这项研究在科学上有重大的价值。它找到了百年来各国学者没有找到的结论，并且对我国当前的工业生产将起很大的作用。庄前鼎教授在这项研究中，找到了代表煤的全部奥秘的“煤的简化特性系数B′”，利用它作煤的分类，只要有元素分析数据，就可以用他建议的双坐标图进行。这可以节省好多试验粘结性的实验工作，同时还便于勘测矿产，计划煤的开采和选择适当的煤。
    庄前鼎教授同苏联科学院可燃矿物研究所煤的特性专家、泰茨煤粘结性试验法的发明人泰茨讨论这项研究的时候，泰茨认为这是一个新发现。泰茨用顿巴斯和库茨?兹出产的煤的原始数据作了进一步的核验，结果证实庄前鼎的煤分类法，也可以对苏联的煤进行分类。庄前鼎用苏联、英国、美国等国煤的数据，对他的煤分类作法作了核验，结果证明也完全合用。（黄鼎模）
