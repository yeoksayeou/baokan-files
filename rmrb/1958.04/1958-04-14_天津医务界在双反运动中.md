Tianjin Medical Community in the Double-Anti Movement
By Yang Zhenya, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group of the Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau

In the vigorous rectification campaign, the Tianjin medical community, whose political and ideological work has always been relatively weak, has undergone a profound ideological revolution in the minds of medical personnel in a short period of time, especially through the Double-Anti movement, by firmly grasping the "key link" of political and ideological revolution. The past backwardness is being changed, the socialist line of running hospitals has achieved a decisive victory, and all work is progressing rapidly, with a completely new look.

Cure the Symptoms or the Root? Grasp Ideology or Institutions?

In the past few years, we have carried out reforms in the outpatient clinics, ward work, medical style, and service attitude of the hospitals, and have achieved some results, but the effect has always been limited, and some have even failed. For example, in order to solve the problem of outpatient congestion and reduce patients' waiting time, many measures have been implemented, but they have never been completely resolved. In order to streamline the organization, great efforts have been made in checking work volume and verifying work indicators, but the staffing has become larger and larger. Some hospitals have taken some measures and stipulated some systems to eliminate accidents, but the accidents have not been reduced. In a socialist hospital, the general aspect is to serve the patients, but why are some measures that are beneficial to the people not working? After the rectification campaign, especially the Double-Anti movement, we have more deeply realized that the important thing is the ideological state of the medical and technical personnel. Medical and technical personnel account for 70% of the hospital's staff and play a decisive role in the work. Although many of them have made continuous progress in their thinking since liberation, their political stand, ideological style, business academic viewpoints, etc., have not been fundamentally transformed, and basically retain the bourgeois ideology. Their standpoints and ideas permeate many aspects of the hospital's work, so the hospital shows the struggle between two lines: one is the socialist line upheld by the Party, which is to serve the people wholeheartedly, serve the construction of production, and run hospitals diligently and thriftily; the other is the capitalist line inherited by some medical personnel from the old society, which proceeds from the convenience of the staff and the convenience of the hospital itself. The struggle between these two lines is reflected in many aspects of the hospital's work. If the vast number of medical personnel are not clearly distinguished between these two lines, it will be impossible to completely transform the face of medical work. These two lines have clear and specific manifestations in the various tasks of the hospital: in the rules and regulations, the principle upheld by the Party is "everything starts from the patient," while they are "everything starts from themselves." For example, the ward's living system should be determined according to the patient's recuperation requirements, but what they implement is according to the medical work procedure. For the convenience of work, they can wake up the patient at night to do tests, ask about medical history, wash legs, etc. In scientific research, the line upheld by the Party is to serve the people, to carry out scientific research in combination with practice on the basis of improving the quality of medical care, to solve the problems that need to be solved most urgently in practical work, and at the same time to cooperate closely and support each other; while the capitalist line is to pursue personal fame and gain, scientific research does not take into account practical needs, pursues novelty, and does not cooperate with each other, keeping secrets from each other. On the issue of running hospitals, the Party's line is "running hospitals diligently and thriftily," while the capitalist line is to seek high, big, complete, and new, blindly pursuing "high standards" and "modernization," everything for their own convenience and to gain fame and profit. On the view of improving the relationship between doctors and patients, the Party's view is that it is necessary to first improve the quality of medical care, improve the work system, correct the service attitude, and eliminate accidents and errors in order to improve the relationship between doctors and patients; while people with bourgeois views believe that patients should unconditionally obey the hospital, accidents are inevitable, and emphasize respect for doctors.

After the anti-Rightist struggle, the ideological awareness of medical personnel has been greatly improved, and they have distinguished right from wrong on major issues, but the two paths in business thinking have not been completely resolved. Many people still adhere to the old rules and regulations, and are hesitant to make some major reforms for the convenience of patients, and some even openly oppose them. These situations have made us realize more deeply that although the fierce political and ideological struggle of the anti-Rightist campaign made the vast number of medical personnel clear that they must take the socialist road, it is not clear how to serve the people wholeheartedly and run socialist hospitals well. If we only rely on administrative orders to promote the system before the ideological problem is solved, it will inevitably be less effective, and some may even be completely unworkable. Therefore, in the rectification campaign, especially the Double-Anti movement, the hospitals in Tianjin firmly grasped the principle that improving work must first transform the ideology, and took the revolution in political ideology as the "key link" to promote everything.

Break Superstition, Great Ideological Emancipation

Treat "Regularization" with a Revolutionary Attitude

When mobilizing the masses to attack all waste and conservative phenomena, we gradually came into contact with the so-called "regularization" ideology that has long been dominant in the medical personnel. This ideology is an invisible golden rule in medical work, which shackles people's minds like a "god." Under the control of the "regularization" ideology, many new systems that are convenient for patients and conducive to production cannot be implemented. For example, new measures such as night clinics, Sunday clinics, and doctors' visits to patients have been proposed or tested in the past under the request of the masses, but they have not been realized because these practices do not conform to the requirements of "regularization." Some systems, even if they are changed, change their appearance in implementation. As a result of the long-term rule of the "regularization" concept, medical personnel's thinking has become rigid and has a rigid fixed point of view. They do not understand the truth that all rules and regulations are to serve the people, and people cannot be slaves to rules and regulations. They are accustomed to doing things according to rules, sticking to old rules and regulations. This point of view is the concentrated expression of medical personnel's conservative thinking and a serious obstacle to the great leap forward in medical work.

This "regularization" thinking has four characteristics in hospital work: (1) It starts from the old tradition, not from the actual situation. The standard for medical personnel's work is not how to conform to the objective reality and the needs of the masses, but to mechanically copy a set of "regular" standards and systems learned from capitalist countries, and refuse to face the actual changes in society. This is the case not only for all major rules and regulations, but even for making beds, folding quilts, and clothing styles, all of which follow the old traditions in capitalist hospitals as the norm. This way of thinking not only hinders major improvements, but also makes small improvements difficult. For example, in order to adapt to the characteristics of Chinese people with shorter bodies, the proposal to shorten the bed legs in some hospitals will be strongly opposed. (2) It starts from "one in ten thousand" instead of "ten thousand." It is a thinking that does not focus on the big picture. Many practices in hospitals start from a small number of cases and believe that this is science. There are many routine tasks in hospitals, which are called "routine," but in fact, regardless of whether there is a need or not, they must be done according to regulations. For example, in terms of testing, many unnecessary items are also included in the routine. Long-term "routine" has cultivated formalism and dogmatism in many medical personnel. (3) It starts from shirking responsibility instead of being actively responsible. Several "regular" practices in the hospital all reflect this point. For example, patients must fill out a certificate for admission, surgery, and automatic discharge to show that they are "voluntary" and have nothing to do with the doctor. This thinking reflected in medical work has formed "defensive" tests, photography, and medication. (4) It starts from improving one's own technology instead of improving the quality of medical care. Hospitals often perform several non-essential tests, photography, surgery, and medication, the purpose of which is not entirely to obtain better curative effects, but to collect "materials" for writing papers. The serious thing is that this situation is not only not criticized in the medical personnel, but is considered a "good" behavior. We are not against regularization, but the old "regularization" not only cannot solve the needs of our hospitals today, but also seriously hinders the formation of new regularization. Therefore, the anti-conservatism in the medical community must focus on opposing the old regularization.

How to break the old regularization? First of all, we must enable medical personnel to master the criteria for measuring right and wrong. In the comprehensive rectification stage, the rectification of the medical department and the "regularization" thinking clashed fiercely. At that time, the Party organizations of various hospitals promptly proposed that the measurement of all medical work should start from the 600 million people, from production and construction, from patients, and from running hospitals diligently and thriftily, and organized the masses to examine our work from these four "starting points." Some hospitals also focused on discussing the difference between socialist regularization and capitalist regularization. In the discussion, some medical personnel recalled the fact that they successfully completed medical tasks under very difficult conditions during the Anti-Japanese War and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, which gave everyone a profound education. On the basis of improving ideological awareness, many hospitals mobilized the masses to boldly improve several inspiring major events, implemented the three-shift outpatient system, established simple beds, and expanded the number of beds by 1,700, and other major reforms. Medical personnel saw with their own eyes that the implementation of these reforms was welcomed by the masses, which further encouraged their confidence in boldly eliminating unreasonable systems. At the same time, on the basis of new thinking, a differentiated attitude was adopted towards the old "regular" practices. The unreasonable ones were resolutely opposed and boldly reformed; the useful ones were retained according to the principles of being beneficial to the people and possible under the conditions. For example, we vigorously advocated the implementation of the issue of physicians engaging in certain laboratory operations and the 24-hour responsibility system, which made the vast number of medical personnel understand how to treat medical work from the actual situation and from the patient, and further inspired them to attach importance to improving work according to the actual situation and the principles that are beneficial to the patient. Some medical institutions created a good form of "family ward" in the case of not being able to add simple beds.

After the main obstacle to the ideological leap forward of medical personnel – the "regularization" thinking – was criticized, many major reforms were implemented more smoothly, and some unresolved problems were solved. Then we took the method of "grasping one link and bringing a series," and after each major reform, it brought about the solution of related issues. For example, after breaking the routine in the outpatient clinic, it triggered a series of chain reactions in the ward, laboratory, operating room, catering department, laundry room, etc. In this way, breaking through one point and driving the overall situation swept away the conservative thinking of doing things according to routine in all corners.

Seize the Opportunity and Ride the Wind and Waves

Mobilize Medical Personnel to Transform Themselves

Whether medical personnel can be mobilized to transform themselves is the key to ideological revolution. In the early stage of rectification, the situation in various hospitals was: it was easier to mobilize the masses to expose the shortcomings of the leadership and solve internal problems of the hospital. Generally, as long as the leaders humbly accept the opinions of the masses and conduct in-depth inspections, the enthusiasm of the masses can be mobilized. However, it is more difficult to mobilize the masses to expose themselves, conduct criticism, conduct ideological revolution, and then solve some fundamental major problems in the medical system. How to shift from general problems to mobilizing medical personnel to conduct ideological revolution? Our experience is:

(1) Open the door wide, draw fire to oneself, make major destruction and major construction, and transform ideology. In some past movements, due to excessive consideration of the characteristics of medical work, the breadth and depth of development in the medical community were not enough, so the education received by medical personnel was not profound enough. They have long been accustomed to the life of a "small world," do not understand the socialist hospital road and the reflection of social masses, only consider the problems under their noses, the so-called "only have the vision of a microscope, lacking the vision of a telescope." In order to broaden the horizons of medical personnel and widely listen to the opinions inside and outside the hospital, various hospitals boldly drew fire to themselves and completely opened the hospital doors. Some hospitals organized patients to speak out in the ward clinics and made replies to everything; some hospitals organized medical personnel above the attending physician to directly collect opinions from streets and factories. After doing this, not only did medical personnel realize their various wrong manifestations, but they also realized that medical work must be all for the patient. At the same time, the hospital also mobilized the masses to speak out freely, and hundreds of thousands of big-character posters attacked all waste, conservative phenomena, and the idea of not starting from the patient. On this basis, medical personnel were further mobilized to open their minds, conduct debates, and launched an unprecedentedly profound movement of criticism and self-criticism. Many people proposed to break capitalism and establish socialism, to be both red and expert, and to transform themselves from bourgeois intellectuals into proletarian intellectuals.

(2) Give senior medical personnel a free hand to exercise. In the Double-Anti movement, all hospitals paid attention to mobilizing senior medical personnel to conduct self-transformation together with the staff, which was an important key to doing a good job in rectification. Because they are in a leading position in business work, their attitude is also valued by general medical personnel. According to the situation in Tianjin, in the early stage of rectification, most senior medical personnel were watching and hesitant, with many concerns. They were afraid of not knowing the bottom line, afraid of criticism from big-character posters, and afraid of messing things up. In response to this situation, various hospitals absorbed them to participate in the leadership work of rectification and explained the policies to them. The Party organizations of the hospitals also assisted them in independently undertaking the leadership of the rectification work in their departments, so that through the process of specific leadership, they could learn the working methods of the mass line and be more infected by the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. When the edge of the mass movement turned to exposing internal medical style and work attitude, they were most worried. The Party organizations of various hospitals enlightened them to dare to accept criticism, dare to draw fire to themselves, and the leading cadres of the hospitals also severely improved their shortcomings and conscientiously rectified their work style, which also greatly educated and encouraged them. Many senior medical personnel not only took the initiative to draw fire to themselves, but also posted big-character posters together with the staff. Some senior medical personnel also played a leading role, and some old experts who had not participated in any movement also expressed their determination to transform themselves.

(3) Carrying out competitions and leap forwards in hospitals promoted the revolution in work and ideology. Whether competitions and leap forwards can be carried out in medical work is a problem that has not been solved in the Tianjin medical community for a long time. During the rectification of the medical profession, the phenomenon of comparing progress began to appear when medical personnel visited each other's work reforms. For example, after improvements in improving patient meals and going to the grassroots level, a "catch-up with the advanced" competition immediately appeared in various hospitals after visiting each other. In response to this situation, we adopted the method of constantly organizing visits to advanced things and quickly informing each other, seizing all favorable opportunities to promote mutual comparison, and developing the form of mutual comparison forward with the changes in the situation. For example, in the early stage of rectification, we focused on visiting advanced units and advanced things. In the stage of comprehensive rectification and leap forward, we proposed "find targets and catch up in an all-round way." In the Double-Anti Great Leap Forward stage, we summarized the efforts of the hospitals and planned the city's competition projects. In this way, the rectification movement of the hospitals developed forward in one climax after another under the situation of "comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced," so that medical personnel underwent a profound ideological transformation in an excited and comfortable mood without being forced.

(4) Cherish the enthusiasm of the masses, care for the lives of the masses, and constantly encourage the enthusiasm of the masses to continue regularly. In the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm of the masses in various hospitals was amazing, and many things that were unimaginable on weekdays could be done. For example, more than 1,700 beds were added without increasing national infrastructure investment and without increasing manpower. In this way, the hospital staff have increased more tasks. Many people consider increasing labor intensity and prolonging working hours. Some people work more than ten hours a day, and some even work without leaving work if they can't finish their work, and fight for several days and nights in a row; at the same time, many people ask to abolish certain welfare benefits. In this case, if the health of the masses is not cherished and the issues of life and welfare are not properly handled, the enthusiasm of the masses cannot be consolidated. Therefore, leading cadres of many hospital Party organizations, on the one hand, took the method of taking the lead and going to the masses to fight with the masses. At the same time, they promptly guided everyone to use their enthusiasm to find tricks and improve work methods; they took a very cautious attitude towards the issue of employees proposing to abolish certain welfare benefits, and made reasonable arrangements for medical personnel's accommodation, childcare, meals, rest, and other issues. In this way, medical personnel were more enthusiastic and more full of emotions.

Improve Ideology, Consolidate Achievements,

Throw Away Burdens and Move Forward Lightly

After the great ideological leap forward of medical personnel, how to further improve the ideological results is an important issue. Hospitals in Tianjin generally adopted two methods:

The first is to organize medical personnel to go deep into the workers and peasants to serve the workers and peasants. After some medical personnel went deep into the workers and peasants, they realized the diligent work and simple life of the working people, understood the requirements of the masses for medical personnel, and further improved their political consciousness. The director of the Department of Pediatrics of the Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin Medical College used to think that the hospital could not have family members accompanying them, otherwise the ward would not be managed. After he went deep into the street for a few days, he realized the feelings of the patients' families, and realized that his views did not start from the patient. After many medical personnel made great gains in going deep into the masses, they were more inspired by the enthusiasm to go deep into the masses. Now, the demand to go deep into the masses and exercise themselves has formed a climax.

The second is the movement of opening up hearts to the Party. This is the ideological transformation climax formed by the Tianjin medical community after the Double-Anti Leap Forward. Many people painfully felt that they were insincere to the Party and could not move forward with burdens on their backs, and expressed their firm determination to hand over their innermost thoughts to the Party and the people. This time, the heart-opening movement was more in-depth and thorough than any previous movement. Now this movement is developing widely and deeply. The units that have made rapid progress are preparing to analyze and study the problems raised in the heart-opening and conduct discussions to further improve their thinking. After the heart-opening movement, the ideological gains obtained since the anti-Rightist struggle have been further consolidated and improved.

    天津医务界在双反运动中
    共天津市卫生局党组书记天津市卫生局局长  杨振亚
    在轰轰烈烈的整风运动中，政治思想工作一向比较薄弱的天津医务界，由于紧紧抓住政治思想革命的“纲”，在短短的几个月内，特别是经过双反运动，在医务人员思想中真正进行了一次深刻的思想革命，正在改变过去的落后面貌，社会主义办医院的路线取得了决定的胜利，各项工作一日千里，焕然一新。
    治标还是治本，抓思想还是抓制度
    几年来，我们在医院的门诊、病房工作和医疗作风、服务态度等方面，都曾经进行过改革，也取得了一些成绩，但是效果总是不大，有些甚至失败了。例如，为了解决门诊拥挤、减少病人候诊时间，曾经实行过很多措施，却始终不能彻底解决。为了精简机构，也曾经在查定工作量、核定工作指标等方面用过很大的力量，编制反而越来越大。有的医院为了消灭事故，采取了一些措施，规定了若干制度，事故仍然没有减少。在社会主义的医院里，总的方面是为病人服务的，为什么与人民有利的一些措施还行不通呢？经过整风运动特别是双反运动，使我们更深刻地领会到，重要的在于医务技术人员的思想状况。医务技术人员占医院人数的70％，在工作上起决定作用。他们中间有许多人在解放后思想上虽然不断进步，但他们的政治立场、思想作风、业务学术观点等等，并没有得到根本改造，基本上仍保留着资产阶级的意识形态。他们的立场、思想观点渗入到医院工作的许多方面，于是医院里就表现出了两条路线的斗争：一条是党所坚持的全心全意为人民服务，为生产建设服务，勤俭办医院的社会主义路线；另一条是部分医务人员从旧社会所沿袭下来的一切从工作人员便利出发、从医院本身便利出发的资本主义路线。这两条路线的斗争，在医院的许多工作上都反映出来，如果不使广大医务人员明确划清这两条路线的界限，就无法彻底改造医疗工作的面貌。这两条路线在医院各项工作上都有着鲜明而具体的表现：在规章制度上，党所坚持的原则是“一切从病人出发”，而他们却是“一切从自己出发”。如病房的生活制度应根据病人的休养要求而定，但他们所实行的却是根据医疗工作的程序而定。为了工作方便，他们可以把病人在夜晚唤醒，作化验、问病历、洗腿等。在科学研究上，党所坚持的路线是为人民服务，在提高医疗质量的基础上结合实际开展科学研究，首先解决实际工作最需要解决的问题，同时要密切协作，相互支援；而资本主义路线却是追求个人名利，科学研究不顾实际需要，追奇猎异，而且互不配合，彼此“保密”。在办医院问题上，党的路线是“勤俭办院”，而资本主义路线却是求高、求大、求全、求新，盲目追求“高标准”、“现代化”，一切为了自己方便和成名图利。在对改善医群关系的看法上，党的看法是必须首先提高医疗质量，改善工作制度，端正服务态度，消灭事故差错，才能改善医群关系；而具有资产阶级观点的人却认为病人要无条件地服从医院，事故不可避免，强调尊敬医师。
    经过反右派斗争，医务人员思想觉悟有很大提高，辨明了大是大非，但是在业务思想上的两条道路并没有完全解决。许多人仍然坚持旧的规章制度，对一些为便利病人而进行的重大改革踌躇不前，有的人甚至公开反对。这些情况更使我们认识到：经过反右派这一场激烈的政治思想斗争，虽然使广大医务人员明确了必须走社会主义道路，但如何全心全意为人民服务，办好社会主义医院，还不明确。在思想问题没有得到解决以前如果仅仅依靠行政命令来推行制度，必然就收效不大，有的甚至根本行不通。因此，天津各医院在整风运动，特别是双反运动中，紧紧抓住改进工作必须首先改造思想这一原则，把政治思想上的革命作为推动一切的“纲”。
    破除迷信，思想大解放
    用革命态度对待“正规化”
    在发动群众猛攻一切浪费、保守现象的时候，逐渐接触到医务人员中长期处于统治地位的所谓“正规化”思想。这种思想在医疗工作中是一条无形的金科玉律，像“神”一样束缚着人们的思想。在“正规化”的思想支配下，许多便利病人、有利于生产的新制度不能实行。如夜间门诊、星期日门诊、医生出诊等新措施，过去在群众要求下虽然就提出过或者试验过，但是因为这些作法不合乎“正规化”的要求而没有实现。也有些制度即使改了，但实行中就变了样子。“正规化”观念长期统治的结果，已使医务人员思想僵化，具有一种死板的固定观点，不知道一切规章制度都是为人民服务的，人不能作规章制度奴隶的道理。而习惯于照章办事，墨守陈规旧律，这种观点是医务人员保守思想的集中表现，是医疗工作跃进的严重障碍。
    这种“正规化”思想在医院工作中有四个特点：（一）是从旧传统出发，而不是从实际出发，医务人员工作的一切标准不是如何符合客观实际，符合群众需要，而是生搬一套由资本主义国家学来的“正规”的标准制度，而不肯面向社会的实际变化，不但一切大的规章制度如此，甚至铺床、叠被、衣服式样，都以遵循资本主义国家医院中的旧传统为正规。这种思想方法不但障碍大的改进，连小的改进也是困难的。如有的医院为了适应中国人身体较矮的特点，提出裁短床腿都会遭到严重反对。（二）从“万一”出发，不是从“一万”出发，不从大处着眼的思想。医院有很多作法是从少数出发，而且认为这就是科学，在医院中有许多例行工作，名为“常规”，实际上就是不管有无需要，都要照规定作一遍。如在化验方面，就有很多不需要的项目也列入了常规。长期的“常规”养成许多医务人员的形式主义、教条主义。（三）从推卸责任出发，而不是从积极负责出发。医院的若干“正规”作法全反映了这一点。如病人入院、动手术、自动出院都要填写一张证书，以表示都是“自愿”，而与医生无关。这种思想反映到医疗工作中已形成“设防”性的化验、照像、用药。（四）从提高自己技术出发，而不从提高医疗质量出发，医院中常要作若干在治疗上非必要的化验、照像、手术、用药，其目的并不全是为了取得更好的疗效，而是为了把“材料”凑全写论文。严重的还在于这种状况在医务人员中不但无人责难，而且认为是一种“好”行为。我们并不是反对正规化，但旧的“正规化”不但不能解决我们今天医院的需要，而且严重地障碍了新的正规化的形成。因此，在医务界的反保守，就须集中反对旧正规。
    如何打破旧正规？我们首先是使医务人员掌握衡量是非的标尺。在全面整改阶段，医疗部门的整改与“正规化”思想就发生了激烈抵触。当时，各院党组织就及时提出衡量一切医疗工作要从六亿人民出发，从生产建设出发，从病人出发，从勤俭办医院出发，并组织群众从这四个“出发”来检查我们的工作。有些医院还着重讨论了社会主义的正规化与资本主义正规化的区别。讨论中，有的医务人员回忆了抗战时期和抗美援朝时期在十分艰苦的条件下，胜利完成医疗任务的事实，使大家受到了深刻的教育。在思想觉悟提高的基础上，许多医院发动群众大刀阔斧地改进了几件振奋人心的大事，实行了三班门诊制，建立了简易病床，挖掘潜力扩大病床一千七百张等大的改革。医务人员亲眼看到实行这些改革受到群众欢迎的情况，更加鼓舞了他们大胆革除不合理制度的信心。同时，在新的思想基础上，对旧的“正规”作法采取了区别对待的态度。对其中不合理的坚决反对，大胆改革；对有益的东西，根据对人民有利和条件可能的原则保留下来。如医师从事某些化验操作的问题、二十四小时负责制等，我们就大力提倡实行，这样就更使广大医务人员懂得如何从实际出发和从病人出发来对待医疗工作，也进一步启发了他们重视根据实际情况、按照对病人有利的原则来改进工作。有的医疗机构就在不能增设简易病床的情况下，创造了“家庭病房”的良好形式。
    在医务人员思想跃进的主要障碍——“正规化”思想被批判以后，许多重大改革就比较顺利地实现了，一些没有解决的问题得到了解决。紧接着我们又采取“抓一环，带一串”的办法，在每一件重大的改革以后，又带起了有关问题的解决。如门诊打破常规以后，就引起了病房、化验室、手术室、饮食部、洗衣房等一系列的连锁反应。这样突破一点，带动全盘，就扫荡了各个角落按常规办事的保守思想。
    抓紧时机，乘风破浪
    发动医务人员自我改造
    能否发动医务人员进行自我改造是思想革命的关键。整改初期，各院的情况是：发动群众揭发领导上的缺点，解决医院内部问题比较容易，一般只要领导虚心接受群众意见，进行深刻检查，就能发动起群众的积极性；但是发动群众来自我揭发，开展批评，进行思想革命并进而解决医疗制度上某些带根本性的重大问题时，就比较困难。如何从一般问题转向发动医务人员进行思想革命？我们的体会是：
    （一）敞开大门，引火烧身，大破大立，改造思想。在过去一些运动中由于过多地照顾医疗工作的特点，在医务界中开展的广度和深度都不够，因而医务人员所受的教育不够深刻。他们长期习惯于“小天地”的生活，不了解社会主义的医院道路和社会群众反映，只考虑自己鼻子下面的问题，所谓“只有显微镜的眼光，缺乏望远镜的眼光”。为了开阔医务人员的视野，广泛听取医院内外的意见，各医院大胆地引火烧身，把院门彻底敞开。有些医院在病房门诊组织病人鸣放，并且作到件件有答复；也有些医院组织主治医师以上的医务人员到街道、工厂直接搜集意见。这样做了以后，不但医务人员认识到了他们形形色色的错误表现，而且也体会到了医疗工作必须一切为了病人。在这同时，医院内部也发动群众大鸣大放，数十万张大字报猛攻一切浪费、保守现象和不从病人出发的思想。在这个基础上，进一步发动医务人员敞开思想，进行辩论，开展了一个空前深刻的批评与自我批评运动。许多人提出要破资本主义、立社会主义，又红又专，把自己由资产阶级知识分子改造成为无产阶级知识分子。
    （二）放手锻炼高级医务人员。双反运动中，各医院都注意了发动高级医务人员同职工一道进行自我改造，是搞好整改的重要关键。因为他们在业务工作上都居于领导地位，他们的态度也为一般医务人员所重视。根据天津的情况，高级医务人员在整改初期多数是观望不前，顾虑重重。他们怕不摸底，怕大字报批评，怕改乱了。针对这种情况，各医院都吸收他们参加整改的领导工作，向他们讲清政策。医院的党组织还协助他们独立担负起领导本部门的整改工作，通过具体领导的过程，使他们学会群众路线的工作方法，更多地受到群众革命热情的感染。在群众运动的锋芒转向揭发内部医疗作风、工作态度时，他们顾虑最大，各医院党组织就启发他们勇于接受批评，敢于引火烧身，而且医院领导干部狠狠地改进缺点，认真地整顿作风，也使他们受到很大的教育和鼓舞。许多高级医务人员不但主动引火烧身，还同职工一道贴大字报。有些高级医务人员还发挥了带头作用，一些没有参加过任何运动的老专家，也表示了改造自己的决心。
    （三）在医院中开展评比和跃进，促进了工作与思想革命。能否在医疗工作中开展评比与跃进是天津医务界长期没有解决的问题。在这次整改中医务人员互相参观工作改革的时候，开始出现了比进步的现象。如改善病人伙食、下地段等工作的改进，各院在相互参观以后，立即出现了“赶先进”的竞赛。针对这一情况，我们就采取对先进事物不断组织参观与迅速通风报信的办法，抓住一切有利时机促进互比，并把互比的形式紧随着形势的变化向前发展。如在整改初期，着重对先进单位、先进事物的参观，在全面整改跃进的阶段，提出“找对象，全面赶”，在双反大跃进阶段又集中概括了医院的努力方向，规划出全市的评比项目，这样就使医院的整改运动在“比先进、赶先进”的形势下，一个高潮接一个高潮地向前发展，使医务人员在兴奋而舒畅的心情下，并不勉强地经历一番深刻的思想改造。
    （四）爱护群众积极性，亲切关怀群众生活，不断地鼓舞群众干劲，使之经常持续下去。各医院在大跃进中群众干劲是惊人的，许多平日想不到的事情，都能办到。如在不增加国家基建投资和不增加人力的情况下，增加了一千七百多张病床。这样，医院工作人员都增加了更多的任务。许多人就从增强劳动强度、延长工作时间方面来考虑，有的每天工作十几小时，甚至有的工作不完不下班，连战几昼夜；同时，许多人要求取消某些福利待遇。在这种情况下，如果不珍惜群众健康，并恰当地处理生活福利问题，就不能巩固群众的积极性。因此，许多医院党组织的领导干部一方面采取身先士卒的办法，到群众中去，与群众同战斗。同时，及时引导大家把热情用到找窍门、改进工作方法方面去；对职工提出的取消某些福利待遇问题采取了十分慎重的态度，对医务人员的住宿、托儿、膳食、休息等问题也作了合理安排。这样就使医务人员干劲更足，情绪更加饱满。
    提高思想，巩固成绩，
    丢掉包袱，轻装前进
    在医务人员思想大跃进以后，如何进一步提高思想成果是一个重要问题。天津市各医院一般采取了两种方式：
    第一种是组织医务人员深入工农群众为工农服务。一些医务人员深入到工农群众中去以后，体会到劳动人民勤恳的工作和朴素的生活，了解了群众对医务人员的要求，进一步提高了政治觉悟。天津医学院附属医院儿科主任过去认为医院不能有家属陪伴，否则病房就无法管理，当他深入到街道工作几天，体会到病人家属的心情以后，就认识到自己的看法不是从病人出发。许多医务人员在深入群众取得重大收获以后，更激发了深入群众的热情。现在要求深入群众、锻炼自己已形成高潮。
    第二种是向党交心运动。这是天津市医务界在双反跃进之后形成的思想改造高潮。许多人痛感到对党三心二意、背着包袱无法前进，表示坚决向党和人民交出知心话。这次交心运动比以前任何一项运动思想敞开得都更为深入和彻底。现在这一运动正向广泛深入发展，进展快的单位准备对交心中谈出的问题分析研究，进行讨论，进一步提高思想。经过交心运动，使反右派斗争以来获得的思想收获进一步巩固和提高。
