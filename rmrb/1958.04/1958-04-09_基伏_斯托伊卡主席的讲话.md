Comrade Premier of the State Council, Comrades and Friends:
    As the delegation of the Romanian People's Republic Government departs from the capital of your great and glorious country, we would like to express our warmest gratitude to the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people. We thank them for the enthusiastic hospitality and care that the delegation received during its visit. We will forever remember the images of everything we saw in your country, the images of the people we met in the factories, fields, and construction sites, in Beijing and Wuhan, in Xi'an and Kunming, and in all the places we visited. They received us with fraternal friendship and conveyed their friendly greetings to the Romanian people; we will be very happy to convey these greetings to our people and introduce to them the profound impressions we have accumulated during our visit.
    Contact with the Chinese people and their long-tested leaders has provided us with the opportunity to directly understand the close unity of the Chinese people. Under the wise and long-tested leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved brilliant accomplishments in the cause of transforming China into a socialist industrial power. Your achievements are our achievements, a victory for the entire socialist camp and all forces of peace and progress.
    Our visit and talks in your country have been fruitful. These are embodied in the important document signed yesterday - the Sino-Romanian Joint Statement. The statement emphasizes that our two governments and two peoples are determined to develop and deepen the fraternal friendship and multi-faceted cooperation in the spirit of socialist internationalism, and are determined to continuously strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is the main guarantee of peace and security for all peoples. The joint statement also reflects the firm support of our two countries for the policy of peaceful coexistence with countries with different social systems, as well as for the easing of international tensions and the cause of defending peace.
    Before parting with you, I once again express the sincerest wishes of the Romanian people to the fraternal Chinese people, wishing them new and great achievements in their labor and struggle for the lofty goals of building socialism and defending peace.
    Dear comrades, goodbye!

    基伏·斯托伊卡主席的讲话国务院总理同志，同志们和朋友们：
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团在离开你们伟大而光荣的祖国首都的时候，愿向中华人民共和国政府和中国人民表示最热烈的谢意。感谢他们对代表团在访问期间所受到的充满热情的款待和关怀。我们将永远记住，在你们国家里所看到的一切的形象，即在工厂、田地和工地，在北京和武汉，在西安和昆明，在我们到的各地所见到的人们的形象。他们以兄弟般的友情接待了我们，并把他们向罗马尼亚人民的友好的问候转达给我们；我们将很愉快地把这种问候向我国人民转达，并向他们介绍在访问期间所积累的深刻的印象。
    与中国人民及其久经考验的领袖们的接触，给我们提供了直接了解中国人民紧密团结的机会。中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明而久经考验的领导之下，在把中国变成为社会主义工业强国的事业中获得了辉煌的成就。你们的成就就是我们的成就，是整个社会主义阵营以及和平和进步的一切力量的胜利。
    我们在你们国家的访问和会谈是富有成果的。这些都体现在昨天签字的重要文件——罗中联合声明里。声明强调指出，我们两国政府和两国人民决心发展和加深本着社会主义国际主义精神的兄弟友谊和多方面的合作关系，决心不断加强各国人民和平和安全的主要保证，即以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结一致。联合声明同时也反映了我们两国对与所有不同社会制度国家和平共处的政策，以及对缓和国际紧张局势和保卫和平事业的坚决拥护。
    在与你们分别以前，再一次地表示罗马尼亚人民对兄弟的中国人民最诚挚的祝愿，祝他们在为建设社会主义和保卫和平的崇高目标而进行的劳动和斗争中，获得新的和伟大的成就。
    亲爱的同志们，再见！
