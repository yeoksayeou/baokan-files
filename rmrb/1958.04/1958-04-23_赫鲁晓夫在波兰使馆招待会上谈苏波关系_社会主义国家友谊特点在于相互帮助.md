Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 22nd—According to a TASS report from Moscow: Comrade Khrushchev spoke at a reception held by the Polish Embassy on April 21st. The reception was hosted by the Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation. Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Kirichenko, Kozlov, Khrushchev, and Kosygin attended the reception.

Comrade Khrushchev said: The 21st of April is a pleasant day, because thirteen years ago, the Soviet-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation was signed. Thirteen years have passed, and these have been wonderful years.

Khrushchev said that in the history of the relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union, there have been various changes. However, the Polish people cannot be held responsible for the actions of their kings and Piłsudski, nor can the Soviet people be held responsible for the actions of the Tsars. The relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union has been established on a new, socialist foundation. The general goals of the policies of the two countries are consistent, because both countries are advancing along the path of socialist development.

Comrade Khrushchev emphatically spoke about the friendship between the Polish and Soviet peoples. He said: Among the Polish people emerged such an outstanding revolutionary as Dzerzhinsky, an excellent man, and a friend of the great Lenin. It was not accidental that Lenin suggested approving Dzerzhinsky as the chairman of the Extraordinary Commission after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution. He—the son of the Polish people—gained enormous trust. Dzerzhinsky served the proletarian revolution, the cause of the working class, and the cause of the working people until his last breath.

Now, Voroshilov and other comrades are visiting Poland. They held inspiring meetings with the Polish working people and were warmly welcomed by the Polish people. Khrushchev said that we should continue to do everything possible to strengthen the friendship between our two peoples. This is not only because we are neighboring countries, but because we, like the people of all socialist countries, have common goals and common interests. We must not forget that we once had a common enemy, who first invaded Poland and then crossed Polish territory to invade the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that we must do our best to consolidate the friendship of the people of all socialist countries. Proletarian internationalism is not abstract friendship and mutual sympathy. We cannot imagine that one socialist country achieves great success in its economic development, while other socialist countries stagnate. The essence and characteristics of the friendship of socialist countries lie in their mutual assistance. If one socialist country achieves great success, then it considers it its fraternal responsibility to help the development of other socialist countries.

Comrade Khrushchev said that all socialist countries will move towards communism. This means that socialist countries must exchange experiences and knowledge, and must help each other. Only on this basis can we move forward smoothly, and can we have selfless, fraternal friendship.

Socialist countries, by their very nature, cannot survive by exploiting other countries. When we, as the most powerful socialist country, aid other countries, give them loans, and provide them with equipment, do we harbor the purpose of oppression and seizing material interests? No. The purpose of our policy is not to extract profits from assisting other countries. This kind of policy is inherent in monopoly capital and capitalist countries, but not in the policies of socialist countries. The Soviet Union gives fraternal assistance to socialist countries in order to advance together with them towards the great goal—communism.

In concluding his speech, Comrade Khrushchev toasted to the friendship of socialist countries, to the consolidation of the powerful socialist camp, and to the strengthening of the role of the working class in the struggle for the victory of socialism. He also toasted to the Polish people, the Polish Party and government, and Comrade Gomulka.

    赫鲁晓夫在波兰使馆招待会上谈苏波关系
    社会主义国家友谊特点在于相互帮助
    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：赫鲁晓夫同志4月21日在波兰大使馆招待会上讲了话。这个招待会是波兰驻苏联大使为了纪念苏波友好、互助与战后合作条约签订十三周年而举行的。苏联共产党和政府的领导人基里钦科、科兹洛夫、赫鲁晓夫和柯西金出席了这个招待会。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说：4月21日这个日子，是令人愉快的日子，因为在十三年前，签订了苏波友好、互助与战后合作条约。十三年过去了，这是一些美好的岁月。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在波兰和苏联的相互关系的历史中，曾经发生过各种变化。但是，波兰人民不能对他们的国王和毕苏斯基的行动负责，而苏联人民也不能对沙皇的行动负责。波兰和苏联两国之间的关系是在新的、社会主义的基础上建立起来的。两个国家的政府的政策的总目标是一致的，因为两个国家都是沿着社会主义发展的道路前进的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在这里着重地谈到苏波两国人民的友谊。他说：波兰人民中间出现了像捷尔任斯基这样杰出的革命家，一个出色的人，是伟大列宁的朋友。列宁在十月社会主义革命胜利以后建议批准捷尔任斯基担任非常委员会的主席，这不是偶然的。他——波兰人民的儿子取得了巨大的信任。捷尔任斯基为无产阶级革命，为工人阶级的事业和劳动人民的事业服务直到最后一口气。
    现在，伏罗希洛夫和其他一些同志正在波兰访问。他们同波兰劳动人民举行了令人激动的会见，受到波兰人民的热烈欢迎。赫鲁晓夫说，我们应当继续尽一切努力，来加强我们两国人民的友谊。这不仅是因为我们是接壤的邻邦，而是因为我们，像一切社会主义国家的人民一样，有共同的目标和共同的利益。我们不能忘记，我们曾有过共同的敌人，他们先侵犯波兰，然后又跨过波兰的国土侵犯苏联。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们必须尽力巩固所有社会主义国家人民的友谊。无产阶级国际主义不是抽象的友谊和相互同情。我们不能想像：一个社会主义国家在本国的经济发展中获得了高度成就，而其他社会主义国家则停滞不前。社会主义国家友谊的实质和特点也就在于它们相互援助。如果一个社会主义国家获得了巨大的成就，那末，它认为帮助其他社会主义国家的发展就是自己兄弟般的责任。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，一切社会主义国家都将走向共产主义。这意味着，社会主义国家必须交流经验和知识，必须相互帮助，只有在这个基础上才能顺利地前进，才能有无私的、兄弟般的友谊。
    社会主义国家由于它的本质是不可能依靠剥削其他国家来生存的。当我们作为最强大的社会主义国家援助其他国家，给予它们贷款、向它们提供设备的时候，难道我们怀着压迫和攫取物质利益的目的吗？没有。我们政策的目的不是从对其他国家的援助中攫取利润。这种政策是垄断资本、资本主义国家所固有的，但是，不是社会主义国家的政策。苏联给予社会主义国家以兄弟援助，是要同它们一起向伟大的目标——共产主义前进。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在结束他的讲话时为社会主义国家的友谊，为强大的社会主义阵营的巩固，为工人阶级在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中的作用的加强而干杯。他并且为波兰人民，波兰党和政府以及哥穆尔卡同志干杯。
