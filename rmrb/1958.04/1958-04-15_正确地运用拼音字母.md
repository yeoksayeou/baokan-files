    Correctly Using Pinyin Letters
    Since the promulgation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, which was passed at the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress in February, Pinyin letters have been gradually introduced on the names of various newspapers, periodicals, and magazines for trial use. This is a good thing.
    However, it is worth pointing out that some newspapers have misused and misspelled Pinyin letters. For example, "中国林业工人报" (China Forestry Worker's Newspaper) should be spelled as "ZHONGGUO LINYE GONGREN BAO," but "LINYE" was mistakenly spelled as "LINYI." This is just one example among many.
    I believe this phenomenon is undesirable. Newspapers are examples for learning. If the people who edit the newspaper themselves do not learn well, wouldn't it become a "profound and unfathomable" thing that is difficult to learn in the eyes of others? I suggest that when using Pinyin letters to spell the names of certain newspapers and magazines in the future, we should learn from this lesson and avoid using the wrong spelling and misspelling again, so as not to cause adverse effects on the general public.

    正确地运用拼音字母
    汉语拼音方案，自从2月间在第一届全国人民代表大会第五次会议通过以后，拼音字母就在各种报纸、刊物、杂志的名称上陆续开始试用了。这是一件好事。
    但是，值得提出的是：有些报纸将拼音字母用错和拼错了。如“中国林业工人报”，应拼写为“ZHONGGUO　LINYE　GONGREN　BAO”，可是却将“LINYE”错拼为“LINYI”。这只是许多事例中的一例。
    我认为，这种现象是不应有的。报纸是学习的榜样，编报的人本身都学习不好，在别人看来，岂不成了一种“高深莫测”难以学习的东西了吗？建议今后再用拼音字母来拼写某些报刊、杂志的名称时，应吸取这个教训，不要再用错拼错，给广大群众造成不良影响。
