    Actively Organize Collaboration
    Tian Lianqian
    In the Great Leap Forward, widely organizing mutual aid and cooperation among communes, townships, and even on a larger scale, sharing resources, and learning from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses is an important measure to adjust production relations and develop productive forces.
    Many things that people didn't even dare to think about in the past, they have not only dared to think about but also dared to do during the production upsurge since last winter. Therefore, all localities have created many great achievements in production and construction; leadership departments and leading cadres at all levels have also improved their leadership methods and created a lot of work experience in organizing the masses to achieve a great leap in production. Organizing collaboration is one of these many good experiences, and it should be greatly promoted.
    When the Shouyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province inspected the spring plowing work, they found that many agricultural cooperatives wanted to grow more potatoes, but there was a shortage of potato seeds; many cooperatives wanted to dig wells, but there were not enough bricks and stones; some cooperatives, although they dug wells, failed halfway because they did not understand the technology and the well walls collapsed; ... Faced with these new problems, what should the leaders do? Should they turn a blind eye to it and ignore it? Or should they organize socialist large-scale collaboration, break the boundaries of agricultural cooperatives, mobilize all manpower, material resources, and technology, support each other, and develop production?
    The Shouyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did the right thing in this regard. After discovering these problems, they adopted the attitude that materialists should have and went deep into reality to conduct investigations. The facts told them that potato seeds, bricks and stones, and other materials were not lacking in every cooperative or in everything in Shouyang County, but there were surpluses and shortages among them; as for technology, it was the same - if it wasn't available here, there were experts somewhere else. After they figured this out, they also found a way to solve the problem, which was to organize adjustments and organize collaboration. The Shouyang County Committee actively led this work and expanded the collaboration from thirteen agricultural cooperatives to the entire county. As a result, the problems of seeds, fertilizers, technology, intercropping land, and labor in seventy-three agricultural cooperatives were all solved. This provided a material basis for the leap forward plan in the spring plowing stage.
    Generally speaking, large-scale collaboration has more power than small-scale collaboration and can solve more problems for more units. However, this does not negate the importance of collaboration between a few units. As long as it can solve problems and develop production, small-scale collaboration should also be actively pursued. We hope that leading organs at all levels will actively organize collaborations of various scopes, and we also hope that all units will take the initiative to strengthen collaboration.
    Organizing collaboration requires attention to the principle of mutual benefit. Agricultural cooperatives are collectively owned, and the collaborative relationship between agricultural cooperatives is different from that between state-owned enterprises under ownership by the whole people. In state-owned enterprises, some surplus or lacking materials and manpower can be allocated uniformly by the state. However, between agricultural cooperatives, adjustments can only be made on the basis of voluntary mutual benefit. If handled improperly, it will affect the interests of some people or others. Failure to pay attention to the principle of mutual benefit will affect the consolidation and development of cooperative relations.
    The key to doing a good job in collaboration is to strengthen the leadership of the Party. Socialist collaboration is based on socialist ideology. If agricultural cooperatives cannot consider issues from the perspective of overall interests, and farmers cannot overcome selfishness, it will be difficult to carry out collaboration extensively. We must strengthen political and ideological work, explain to farmers the relationship between the whole and the part, the immediate and the long-term, so that all farmers truly realize that socialist collaboration is beneficial to both parties; thereby actively and sincerely helping others and also obtaining the full support of others. Developing the socialist ideology of farmers is the key to doing a good job in collaboration.
    Adapting to the development of productive forces and timely adjusting production relations is a regular and important task for leading organs at all levels. We hope that the experience of Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, in organizing collaboration can be widely promoted throughout the country!

    积极组织协作
    田连阡
    在大跃进中，广泛地组织社与社、乡与乡、甚至更大范围的互助协作，互通有无，取长补短，这是调整生产关系，发展生产力的一项重要措施。
    过去人们连想也不敢想的许多事情，在去冬以来的生产高潮中不仅已经敢想，而且敢做了。因而各地在生产上、在建设中都创造了许多伟大的成绩；各级领导部门和领导干部也改进了领导方法，创造了很多组织群众实现生产大跃进的工作经验。组织协作，就是这许多好经验中的一个，应该大大推广。
    中共山西寿阳县委在检查春耕工作时发现：有许多农业社想多种薯类，但薯种不足；许多社想打井，砖石不够用；有的社虽然打了井，因为不懂技术，井筒坍坏半途而废；……面对着这些新问题，领导者怎么办呢？是对它熟视无睹，置之不理呢？还是组织社会主义大协作，打破农业社的界限，调动一切人力、物力和技术，互相支援，发展生产呢？
    中共寿阳县委在这方面做得对。他们在发现这些问题以后，便以唯物主义者应有的态度，深入实际进行调查。事实告诉他们，薯种、砖石以及其它物资，在寿阳县并不是社社缺，样样缺，而是互有余缺；至于技术，也是这样——这儿不会，哪儿却有行家。他们摸到了这个底以后，也就找到了解决问题的办法，那就是组织调剂，组织协作。寿阳县委积极地领导了这项工作，并且由十三个农业社之间的协作扩大到全县范围，于是七十三个农业社的种籽、肥料、技术、插花地和劳力等五个方面的问题都得到了解决。这就使春耕阶段的跃进计划有了物质基础。
    从一般情况来看，大范围的协作比小范围的协作力量大，能解决更多单位的更多问题。但是，这并不否定某几个单位之间的协作的重要意义。只要能解决问题，能发展生产，小范围的协作也应该积极地去做。我们希望各级领导机关积极地组织各种范围的协作，我们也希望各单位之间主动地加强协作。
    组织协作需要注意互利原则。农业社是集体所有制，农业社之间的协作和全民所有制的国营企业之间的协作关系有所不同。在国营企业中，有些剩余或缺少的物资和人力，可以通过国家统一调配。而在农业社之间，只能在自愿互利的基础上进行调剂。如果处理不当，就会影响到这一部分人或那一部分人的利益。不注意互利原则，就会影响到协作关系的巩固和发展。
    搞好协作的关键是加强党的领导。社会主义协作是建立在社会主义思想基础上的。如果农业社不能从整体利益考虑问题，农民不能克服自私心理，协作就很难广泛开展。我们必须加强政治思想工作，向农民讲清楚整体和局部、当前和长远之间的利害关系，让所有农民真正认识到社会主义协作对双方都有利；从而积极地、诚恳地帮助别人，也取得别人的全力支援。发展农民的社会主义思想，是搞好协作的关键。
    适应生产力的发展，及时调整生产关系，是各地各级领导机关经常的重要任务。我们希望山西寿阳县组织协作的经验能在各地普遍推广！
