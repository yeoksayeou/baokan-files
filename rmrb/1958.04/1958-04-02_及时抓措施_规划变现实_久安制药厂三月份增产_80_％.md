    Grasp Measures Promptly, Turn Plans into Reality
    Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory Increases Production by 80% in March

    (Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch on April 1st, reporter Feng Jian reports) After setting a great leap forward production plan, the joint state-private Wuhan Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory immediately took forceful measures to solve problems such as the lack of raw materials, insufficient labor, and cramped workshops, turning the plans on paper into leap forward actions. In March, the first month of the leap forward, production increased by 84% compared to January, and by 80% compared to February.

    Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory is a factory that produces veterinary drugs. To adapt to the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production, the planned value of this factory's output this year has increased by 2.2 times compared to last year; the output of various livestock and poultry medicines has increased by one to four and a half times compared to last year. After this great leap forward plan was drawn up, various new problems and imbalances appeared in the factory's production. The main ones were: insufficient supply of pharmaceutical raw materials; labor, factory buildings, and equipment could not fully adapt to the new plan. For example, this factory needs 50 tons of sulfathiazole this year, and one-third of the factory's products require sulfathiazole as a raw material, but the state only allocated 9 tons of sulfathiazole to this factory for the first half of the year. It was also difficult for the first workshop, which originally produced injections, to complete the production plan, which had increased by more than two times, with the original workers, machinery, equipment, and operating space.

    In order to solve the problem of insufficient raw material supply, Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory adopted methods such as collecting substandard raw materials to refine into high-grade raw materials, finding substitutes, and manufacturing raw materials themselves. The factory specifically sent three salesmen to be stationed in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places. They collected reworked substandard raw materials from large pharmaceutical factories in these areas, transported them back to the factory, and turned them into high-grade raw materials through refining and chemical processing. Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory was most lacking in sulfadiazine, but every month it could purchase dozens of kilograms from a pharmaceutical factory in Shanghai using this method.

    After research and experimentation, Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory has found more than 20 kinds of raw material substitutes this year. For example, using widely available sulfanilamide to replace the scarce sulfathiazole, and so on. Such substitution not only solved the problem of insufficient raw materials but also reduced the cost of raw materials by more than three-quarters. Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory plans to increase the production of four kinds of pharmaceutical raw materials that cannot be produced domestically this year, and two kinds have already been produced and put into production.

    In the spirit of self-reliance, Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory trained more than 100 new workers in a very short time and established a new workshop, basically overcoming the difficulty of insufficient manpower. Their training method was to teach technical courses and political courses on the one hand, conduct production practice using waste materials on the other hand, and operate in the workshop with veteran workers on the other hand. After only half a month of training, this group of new workers from all over the world went into the workshop for production.

    In order to increase the production of injections, Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory added a second workshop. It was established using the old buildings and site of a school. The workshop's sixteen disinfection cabinets were also made by the factory itself, using wooden cabinets instead of iron cabinets ordered from outside. Each wooden cabinet was 4,500 yuan cheaper than an iron cabinet, and it was easy to manufacture, so it was quickly put into production.

### 及时抓措施　规划变现实  久安制药厂三月份增产80％

    及时抓措施　规划变现实
    久安制药厂三月份增产80％
    本报武汉1日电　记者冯健报道：公私合营武汉久安制药厂在定出生产跃进规划以后，立即采取有力措施解决原材料缺乏、劳动力不足、车间狭小等问题，把纸上的规划变成了跃进的行动。起步跃进的第一个月——3月份，就比1月份提高了84％，比2月份增产80％。
    久安制药厂是一个生产兽药的工厂。适应农业生产大跃进的需要，今年这个工厂的产值计划，比去年增加了二点二倍；各种牲畜、家禽药品的产量，分别比去年增加了一倍到四倍半。这个大跃进的计划订出以后，厂内生产上出现了种种新的问题和不平衡现象。主要是：制药原料供应不足；劳动力和厂房、设备，跟新的计划不能完全适应。例如，今年这个工厂需要?胺噻唑五十吨，全厂三分之一的产品要用?胺噻唑作原料，但是今年上半年国家只分配给这个厂九吨?胺噻唑。原来生产针剂的第一车间，以原有的工人、机器设备和作业场地，要完成跃进了两倍以上的产量计划，也很困难。
    为了解决原料供应不足的问题，久安制药厂采取了搜罗次级原料精制成高级原料、寻找代用品和自己制造原料等办法。这个工厂专门派出了三个业务员，常驻上海、北京、天津、广州等地。向这些地区的大型制药工厂搜集返工的次级原料，运回工厂，经过精制和化学处理，变成高级原料。久安制药厂最缺乏的?胺嘧啶，每月就能用这个办法从上海一家制药厂收购到几十公斤。
    经过研究、试验，久安制药厂今年已经找到了二十多种原料代用品。如用全国货源充沛的胺苯?胺代替缺乏的?胺噻唑，等等。这样代用，不仅解决了原料不足的问题，还使原料成本降低四分之三以上。久安制药厂今年计划增制四种国内不能生产的医药原料，现在已经有两种制成和投入生产了。
    久安制药厂本着自力更生的精神，在极短的时间内，培训了一百多名新工人，建立了一个新车间，基本上克服了人力不足的困难。他们培训的办法是：一面讲授技术课、政治课，一面利用废旧物料进行生产实习，一面到车间里同老工人跟班操作。只经过了半个多月的培训，这一批来自四面八方的新工人就进车间生产了。
    久安制药厂为了增产针剂，新增了一个第二车间。它是利用一个学校的旧有房屋、场地建立起来的。车间的十六个消毒柜，也是由工厂自己制造的木柜，代替了向外订购铁柜。这种木柜，每一个比铁柜便宜四千五百元，而且制造简便，很快就在生产中用上了。
