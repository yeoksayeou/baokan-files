    If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch tiger cubs?

    Running experimental plots is a good thing. But some people have turned a good thing into a bad thing. The People's Daily once revealed that a person in charge of a certain bureau in Beijing brought along three section chiefs and three comrades to do "specific" work every time he "went to the fields." The masses call this way of running experimental plots "substitute farming."

    This metaphor is very apt. The original purpose of running experimental plots was to improve leadership and eliminate bureaucratic airs, but that leader was still full of bureaucratic airs when running the experimental plot; running experimental plots, as the name suggests, requires personally doing the work, tilling the land oneself, but they only wander around the edges of the fields, pointing and gesticulating. Isn't running experimental plots like this just a matter of having a reputation without the substance?

    Examples of dealing with experimental plots in a perfunctory manner also exist among rural work cadres. According to a People's Daily report on March 19, the experimental plots of many cadres in Maoming County, Guangdong Province, were not living up to their name, and the targets were conservative, which the masses ridiculed as experimental plots of the "regression faction." There are other examples similar to those in Maoming County. The masses cultivate the land with intensive farming, while some cadres' experimental plots are managed extensively; the masses' fields achieve "three lights" and "five cleans," leaving no weeds behind, while the cadres' experimental plots are overgrown with weeds, a desolate sight; the masses' fields have piles of fertilizer, while the cadres' experimental plots are spotless. The masses call such experimental plots "hygiene fields." There are also those that people call "flying planting" experimental plots and "moving" experimental plots. All they have to do is go to the field to "inspect," and when they find that the crops in a certain plot are good, they write an experimental plot sign and stick it in, and shamelessly write a set of "operating procedures" and "technical measures," "claiming it was 'run' by them." According to the masses, it means "not moving the plow or using the hoe, but just relying on the pen to work hard."

    Treating experimental plots in this way is really deceiving oneself and others. If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you catch tiger cubs? If you are afraid of labor and afraid of hardship, and don't experiment yourself, how can you achieve both "redness" and "expertise"? To run experimental plots well, you must work practically. Perfunctory and formalistic approaches are all wrong.

### 不入虎穴，焉得虎子？

    不入虎穴，焉得虎子？
    湖北麻城红光二社　李志良
    办试验田是一件好事。但有的人却把好事办成了坏事。人民日报上曾揭露北京市某局的负责人，每次“下田”的时候，还带上三位科长和三位作“具体”工作的同志。群众把这种办试验田的作法叫作“代耕”。
    这个比喻很恰当。办试验田本来是为了改善领导，扫除官气，而那位领导人办试验田却依然官气十足；办试验田顾名思义就是要亲自动手，躬耕于垅亩之间，而他们却只在田埂上转来转去，指手划脚。这样办试验田岂不是徒有虚名？
    以应付敷衍的态度对待试验田的例子，在农村工作干部中也是存在的。又据3月19日人民日报消息：广东省茂名县不少干部的试验田名不符实，指标保守，群众讥之为促退派的试验田。类似茂名县这样的例子还有。群众种田，精耕细作，而有些干部的试验田却是粗放经营；群众的田里做到“三光”“五净”，寸草不留，而干部试验田里却是杂草丛生，一片荒芜；群众田里积肥成堆，而干部试验田里却是一尘不染。群众叫这样的试验田做“卫生田”。还有一种人们叫它“飞种”试验田和“搬家”试验田。他只须到田间去“验”，发现那丘田的庄稼好，就写个试验田的牌子插上，并大言不惭地写上一套“操作规程”和“技术措施”“说是自己‘办’的。”按照群众的说法就是“不动犁耙不用锄，但凭笔杆下工夫”。
    这样对待试验田，实在是欺人自欺。不入虎穴，焉得虎子？自己怕劳动，怕艰苦，不亲自试验，怎么能达到又红又专？要办好试验田，必须实干。应付敷衍和形式主义的作法都是错误的。
