Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 31st – In the afforestation movement, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region adopted the working method of "grasping the center, starting comprehensively, preparing fully, and making short-term blitzes." After more than a month of hard work, by March 22nd, it had afforested over 17.3 million mu, greatly exceeding the original target of 5.4 million mu for this year. The afforestation area completed in this one month is equivalent to more than nine times the total afforestation area in the nine years from 1937 to 1945 before liberation; it is equivalent to 1.3 times the total afforestation area during the first Five-Year Plan period. According to recent typical surveys, the survival rate is estimated to be 85% to 90%.

While adopting the blitz afforestation method, the Autonomous Region also promoted the experience of "collective mountain ascent and planting large areas first" from the Damiao Mountains. Unprecedented large-scale planting appeared in the region. Various places also universally implemented joint commune, joint township, and joint district afforestation, greening barren mountains and remote mountains that were previously thought to be afforested only with state investment, and eliminating the blank spots caused by the scattered afforestation of communes in the past.

Xinhua News Agency - Henan, Sichuan, Hunan, Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong and other provinces have successively arranged the work of preventing and controlling forest pests this year in order to protect existing forest resources and consolidate afforestation achievements.

Henan Province requires that a spring battle be waged in areas where pine caterpillars occur, with a clean-up in summer and autumn, striving for a great leap forward in pest control work.

Some counties in Shandong Province have determined afforestation and pest control as the two major tasks of forestry production this year. The area bordering Yunnan and Guizhou provinces has experienced pine caterpillar damage for ten years. In the past, measures were not taken in time for radical treatment. This year, a joint pest control headquarters was established to uniformly lead the pest control work in the border areas of the two provinces. Now, all provinces have strengthened their leadership over pest control work, paying attention to grasping the pest situation, transferring medicines and machinery, imparting technology, and mobilizing the masses to carry out pest control competitions.

    突击造林　大片造林
    广西僮族自治区一个月内造林一千七百多万亩  河南四川等省布置防治森林虫害
    据新华社南宁31日电　广西僮族自治区在造林运动中，采用“抓住中心、全面动手、充分准备、短期突击”的工作方法，经过一个多月的苦战，到3月22日已造林一千七百三十多万亩，大大突破了原定今年造林五百四十多万亩的指标。这一个多月完成的造林面积，相当于解放前1937年到1945年九年中造林面积总和的九倍多；相当于第一个五年计划期间造林总面积的一点三倍。根据最近的典型调查，估计成活率都达到85％到90％。
    自治区在采取突击造林方法的同时，还推广了大苗山的“集体上山、先吃大片”的经验，区内出现了前所未有的大面积植林。各地还普遍实行了联社、联乡、联区地造林，使那些过去被认为只有靠国家投资才能造林的荒山和远山成片绿化，并消灭了过去由于社社分散造林所造成的空白点。
    新华社讯　河南、四川、湖南、辽宁、河北、山东等省为了保护好现有森林资源，巩固造林成果，今年都先后布置了防治森林害虫的工作。
    河南省要求在发生松毛虫害的地区苦战一春，夏秋扫尾，力争除虫工作的大跃进。
    山东省有些县把造林、除虫确定为今年林业生产的两大任务。云南和贵州省交界地区发生松毛虫害已有十年历史，过去未及时采取措施进行根治，今年也成立了联合灭虫指挥部，统一负责领导两省边界地区的除虫工作。现在各省对除虫工作都加强了领导，注意掌握虫情、调运药械、传授技术和发动群众开展除虫竞赛。
