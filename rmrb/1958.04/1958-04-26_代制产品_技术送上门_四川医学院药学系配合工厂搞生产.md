　　Sichuan Medical College's Pharmacy Department Cooperates with Factories on Production
　　(Our Newspaper) The Pharmacy Department of Sichuan Medical College, in carrying out its work-study program, has strengthened its ties with neighboring factories and cooperated closely to improve production, which has been welcomed by the factories concerned.

　　After the department established ties with Huayang Pharmaceutical Factory and Chengdu Pharmaceutical Factory, it learned that they needed raw materials for fattening pigs—methylthiouracil and 8-hydroxyquinoline and phenylmercuric acetate for contraception—so it organized efforts to manufacture them. In just one and a half days, methylthiouracil was successfully manufactured, and the price was one-third lower than the market price. They have now accepted the task of producing raw materials for 4,000 fattening pigs. They have also conducted further research on 8-hydroxyquinoline and phenylmercuric acetate, for which they have already mastered the production methods.

　　In order to directly support production and better cooperate with relevant production departments, in addition to having specifically established a chemical manufacturing group to prepare for its own production, it has also decided to deliver scientific and technological expertise to the factories to trial-produce new products. The department's laboratory group has also contacted Chengdu Paper Mill, and plans to have teachers lead some students to the factory every Tuesday and Thursday to help them solve difficulties in laboratory work and train technical personnel for laboratory work.

    代制产品　技术送上门
    四川医学院药学系配合工厂搞生产
    本报讯　四川医学院药学系在开展勤工俭学活动中，与左邻右舍工厂加强联系，配合协作搞好生产，受到有关工厂的欢迎。
    这个系在向华洋药厂、成都药厂挂钩后，了解到他们需要肥猪用的原料——甲基硫氧嘧啶和避孕用的8—羟基喹啉及乙酸苯汞，便组织力量制造，只经过一天半时间，甲基硫氧嘧啶已制造成功，而且价格也比市价低三分之一。他们现已接受生产四千头肥猪用的原料任务。对已掌握生产方法的8—羟基喹啉和乙酸苯汞也作了进一步研究。
    为了直接支援生产并更好地与有关生产部门配合协作，目前他们除已专门成立了化学药品制造组，准备自己进行生产外，还决定把科学技术送上工厂的门去，为工厂试制新的产品。该系的化验组也已和成都造纸厂联系，准备每星期二、四由教师率领部分学生到该厂帮助他们解决化验工作中的困难，培养化验工作的技术人员。
