    Visiting Romania's Cyclotron and Atomic Reactor
    Recently, I joined a group of foreign journalists stationed in Bucharest to visit the cyclotron, which officially went into operation on January 16th of this year near Bucharest. It is the first of its kind to be put into production in the people's democratic countries.

    That day, we set off from Bucharest by car and after traveling about seven or eight kilometers, we saw two new buildings, a towering chimney, and two tall, thick gray cylinders standing not far away in the fields. As we approached, we realized that this was the place we were going to visit. One of the buildings housed the atomic reactor, and the other housed the cyclotron.

    First, we were led into a three-story building with light green carpets on the floor, light green walls, and pure white silk curtains on the windows. The staff were all wearing white coats, looking very much like doctors or nurses on duty. Those who didn't know would certainly think they had come to a hospital. In fact, this building houses the 2,000 kW atomic reactor that went into production last August.

    An engineer in his thirties with curly hair greeted us. He had two pens in the pocket of his white coat, one a real pen and the other a pen-style radiation dosimeter to check the surrounding radiation intensity. He first took us to visit the control room of the atomic reactor. Along the wall of the control room stood a long row of control instruments, marked with various signals transmitted from the atomic reactor. Then, in a large room two stories high, we saw the reactor. It was a large, sky-blue water container. In the center of the water container were uranium rods, surrounded by a 60-centimeter-thick steel plate, and outside the steel plate was a one-meter-wide ring of water, encased in two meters of concrete. We stood at the top of the reactor and looked inside through an observation mirror, seeing nothing but a few red spots. It is here that people release the mysterious atomic energy. The walls around this room are fitted with red and green lights. When the red light, indicating danger, comes on, people need to leave the room immediately, otherwise they will be contaminated by radiation.

    Afterward, we also visited some laboratories related to the atomic reactor. When leaving the building, we saw an inspector at the door, who everyone had to pass by when leaving work to check whether they had been contaminated by radiation. During the inspection, people stand in front of the inspector, and if there is no contamination on their bodies, the light on the inspector will automatically light up; otherwise, the light will not light up. This very sensitive "touchstone" aroused our great interest.

    The engineer told us that it is forbidden to grow crops within eighty meters of the reactor to avoid radioactive contamination of plants, which would harm people and livestock if eaten.

    In another two-story building, we saw the cyclotron, which had only recently started operations. We first stopped in a large, empty, dark room, where we only saw two tracks on the ground leading to the cyclotron workshop. After a young engineer gave us a brief introduction, he led us to the cyclotron workshop. To get to this workshop, we had to go through an iron door, which weighed twenty tons and was painted with a layer of bright red paint. The switches were all electric. When the machine is running, the door must be tightly closed, and people must leave the workshop.

    The day we visited was Monday, and the machine was not running because they only worked five days a week, and Monday was the time to overhaul the machine. We saw a huge machine painted green with a red-dyed wheel—the cyclotron—sitting firmly in the middle of this very solid building. This machine can accelerate particles to 12.5 million electron volts and deuterium nuclei to 25 million electron volts. It can accelerate charged particles needed by scientific research institutes, and it can also produce radioactive isotopes that cannot be obtained in atomic reactors.

    The ion beam generated by the cyclotron is transported through steel pipes to another room, in which there is a cylindrical, birdcage-like target chamber with several observation holes around it. We saw a pile of white paraffin wax on a table next to it. But no one touched it, because it already contained radioactive material. When we walked out of this room, the inspector on the wall outside the door showed that there was still weak radioactivity here.

    The accelerated particles and radioactive isotopes produced by the cyclotron are of great help to research work in geology, medicine, and zoology and botany. Together with the atomic reactor, it will greatly promote the development of Romania's scientific research work. Romania is one of the countries in Europe with the richest radioactive mineral deposits.

    Here, we also saw the great help of the Soviet Union to Romania. The Soviet Union supplied the equipment and provided the necessary technical guidance. A Romanian engineer said that with the help of Soviet experts, they have now learned to operate such a modern machine.

### 参观罗马尼亚的回旋加速器和原子反应堆

    参观罗马尼亚的回旋加速器和原子反应堆
    最近，我随驻布加勒斯特的一群外国记者，在布加勒斯特近郊参观了今年1月16日正式使用的人民民主国家中最先投入生产的回旋加速器。
    这一天，我们坐着汽车从布加勒斯特出发，走了大约七、八公里路时，就看见田野上不远的地方矗立着两座新的楼房、一个高耸的烟囱和两个灰色的又高又粗的圆柱。走近时，我们才知道这就是我们要参观的地方。两座楼房中，一座里面是原子反应堆，一座里面就是回旋加速器了。
    首先，我们被领进一个三层楼的建筑物里，看到地上铺着淡绿色的地毡，四处粉刷着淡绿色的墙壁，窗上挂着洁白的丝织窗帘，工作人员都穿着白色的罩衣。他们的装束很像正在值班的医生或护士。不知道的人，一定会认为他来到了一个医院里。其实，在这座建筑物的里边安装着去年8月投入生产的，功能为两千瓩的原子反应堆。
    一位三十多岁有着卷曲的头发的工程师迎接我们，在他白罩衣的口袋上挂着两支钢笔，一支是真的钢笔，一支是钢笔式的放射性剂量器，检查周围放射性强度的。他首先带我们参观了原子反应堆的操纵室，沿着操纵室的墙壁，竖立着一长排操纵仪器，仪器上标志着从原子反应堆中传来的各种信号。接着我们在有两层楼高的一个大房间里看到反应堆了。这是一个天蓝色的大水容器。水容器的中心放有铀棒，外面装置着一层六十公分厚的钢板，钢板外是一圈一公尺宽的水，它的外壳是用两公尺厚的水泥包起来的。我们站在反应堆的顶端从观察镜里向里望，除去看到里边有点点红斑以外，什么也看不见。就是在这里，人们把神秘的原子能释放出来。这个房间四周的墙壁上装置着红灯和绿灯，当表示危险的红灯亮了时，人们就需要马上离开房间，否则就要受放射性沾染了。
    随后我们又参观了与原子反应堆有关的一些试验室。在离开这座建筑物的时候，我们看到门口有一个检查器，工作人员下班时都要经过它的检查，看看人们身上是否受到放射性沾染。检查时，人站在检查器前，如身上没有沾染，检查器上的灯就自动发亮，否则灯就不亮了。这个非常敏感的“试金石”，引起了我们的很大兴趣。
    工程师告诉我们说，在反应堆周围八十公尺以内，禁止种庄稼，以免植物受到放射性沾染，使人、畜吃后受害。
    在另一幢两层楼高的建筑物里，我们看到了不久以前才开工的回旋加速器。我们首先在一个空空的很大的阴暗的房间里停留了一会，这里我们只看到地上有两条铁轨通向回旋加速器车间。一位青年工程师向我们简单的介绍了一下情况后，就领我们到回旋加速器车间去。到这个车间要经过一道铁门，铁门有二十吨重，表面涂上了一层鲜红的油漆，开关都是电动的。房间的墙壁有两公尺半厚。在机器开动时，大门就要紧紧的关闭，人们都要离开车间。
    我们参观的这一天是星期一，机器没有开动，因为每星期他们只工作五天，星期一是检修机器的时间。我们看到一台身上涂着绿色、轮盘染着红色庞大的机器——回旋加速器，稳稳地坐在这座十分坚固的建筑物中间。这个机器可以把粒子加速到一千二百五十万电子伏特，把氘核加速到两千五百万电子伏特。它可以加速科学研究所需要的带电粒子，也可以产生在原子反应堆中不能得到的放射性同位素。
    回旋加速器产生的离子束通过钢管输送到另一个房间，在这个房间里有一个圆筒形鸟笼子式的靶室，它的周围有好几个观察孔。我们看到它旁边的一张桌子上放着一堆白色的石腊。但是谁也没有去动它一下，因为它身上已经含有放射物。当我们走出这个房间时，门外墙壁上的检查器显示：这里尚有微弱的放射性。
    回旋加速器中产生的加速粒子和放射性同位素，对地质学、医学和动植物学等的研究工作有很大帮助。它和原子反应堆一起，对发展罗马尼亚的科学研究工作将有巨大的推动作用。罗马尼亚是欧洲放射性矿藏最丰富的国家之一。
    这里，我们也看到了苏联对罗马尼亚的巨大帮助，苏联供给了设备，给了必需的技术指导。一位罗马尼亚工程师说，在苏联专家的帮助下，现在他们已经学会了操纵这样现代化的机器。
