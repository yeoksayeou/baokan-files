Analyze Soil, Utilize Rationally
Qin'an County Party Committee Investigates and Researches Various Types of Land in the County

(Our Newspaper News) The Gansu Daily reports: In order to concretely implement the grand plan of "Crossing the Ridge in Two Years, Crossing the River in Five Years, and Achieving a Thousand-Jin County in Eight Years," and to strive to increase the average per-mu yield of the county from 194 jin in 1957 to 400 jin this year, the Qin'an County Party Committee in Gansu Province, in addition to adopting effective measures such as grasping water conservancy, grasping fertilizer, and intercropping, double cropping, and planting two crops a year, has also actively organized forces to investigate and analyze the properties of various types of soil throughout the county, so as to truly achieve planting crops according to local conditions and increase grain production.

As early as mid-January, taking advantage of the winter vacation of various schools, the Qin'an County Party Committee selected a group of people with specialized knowledge in geology, physics, chemistry, etc., and, together with the staff of the Central Agricultural Technology Station, formed two soil investigation and research work groups. Carrying various testing instruments and data, they went to 37 townships in six districts to analyze various types of soil in the county, dividing them into four categories: high mountain, mid-mountain, both banks of river valleys, and plain areas. They determined to take eight to twelve soil samples from each township and used soil component rapid testers and soil nutrient rapid testers to conduct detailed analysis and testing. They also held five symposiums with more than 40 experienced farmers. Finally, it was found that there are five types of soil in the county: yellow soil, chestnut calcium soil, red sandy loam, red clay, and chicken manure soil. Yellow soil is mainly distributed in the Yangshan and plain areas, accounting for about 49% of the total area of the county; chestnut calcium soil is mainly distributed in the Yinshan Er Yin area and some plain areas, accounting for about 38% of the total area; red sandy loam is mainly distributed near the foothills and some plain areas, accounting for about 0.4% of the total area. Red clay is mainly distributed in general broken gullies, rotten bays, and slopes of ravines, accounting for about 0.9% of the total area; chicken manure soil is found in general mountainous areas in various townships, but the quantity is very small, accounting for about 0.2% of the total area.

According to the investigation, all types of soil in the county contain lime. Among them, those with a higher content account for about 35% of the total cultivated land area, and those with a lower content account for about 15%; the lime content is lower in general high slopes, ridge tops, and sunny slopes, and higher in lower slopes, plains, and shady slopes, and individual areas have strong alkalinity; the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content of various soil types also varies. The nitrogen content of black soil is higher than that of other soil types, the nitrogen and phosphorus content of red soil is very lacking, and the nitrogen content of yellow soil is between red and black soil.

Based on the above investigation and analysis, the Qin'an County Party Committee believes that in order to improve the soil in the Qin'an area, the focus should be on increasing nitrogen fertilizer: 1. Applying more dilute fertilizer, human manure, and stable manure is very effective in increasing soil fertility, promoting the granular structure of the soil, and increasing the calcium and carbon dioxide content in the soil air and soil solution, which is conducive to reducing alkalinity; 2. Planting more leguminous plants can increase the nitrogen content of the soil. At the same time, adopting crop rotation and intercropping of leguminous plants and gramineous plants can also increase the granular structure of the soil and retain moisture; 3. Applying chemical fertilizer ammonium sulfate mixed with livestock manure can also increase the nitrogen content of the soil. In addition to this, it is necessary to greatly maintain and increase the moisture in the soil, build water conservancy projects, expand irrigation, maintain water and soil, and avoid the loss of the surface layer of the soil. In broken gullies, rotten bays, and barren mountains, special attention should be paid to planting trees and grasses and building windbreaks to prevent soil surface erosion and wind erosion.

The above investigation and analysis show that in the yellow soil areas of Yangshan and the plains, it is most suitable to plant corn, sorghum, millet, potatoes, wheat, and oats; in the Yinshan Er Yin area and the chestnut calcium soil areas of the plains, it is most suitable to plant naked oats and bean crops; in the red soil areas near the foothills and some plains, it is suitable to plant sorghum, corn, millet, and wheat; in general red clay areas, it is suitable to plant wheat, oats, Tartary buckwheat, and Tartary millet; chicken manure soil in mountainous areas is very suitable for planting corn, sorghum, potatoes, millet, naked oats, and bean crops.

According to the soil distribution in different regions, the Qin'an County Party Committee has determined the focus, equipped cadres, and, in conjunction with experimental fields, will vigorously carry out multi-point experiments starting this year. In addition, the county committee also specially studied soil-related issues at the agricultural technology conference. The county committee called on all cadres in the county to seriously study soil science through experimental fields, transform from laymen into experts, and truly achieve planting according to local conditions, so as to ensure a bumper harvest this year and strive to complete the county committee's proposed program of action ahead of schedule. At present, a series of land preparation, fertilization, and other experimental work have begun in key areas.

    分析土壤　合理利用
    秦安县委对全县各类土地进行调查研究
    本报讯　甘肃日报报道：中共甘肃秦安县委为了具体贯彻“两年越岭，五年跨江，八年实现千斤县”的宏伟计划，争取今年全县平均亩产由1957年的一百九十四斤提高到四百斤，除采取抓水利、抓肥料和间种、套种、一年种两槎等有效措施外，他们还积极组织力量，在全县范围内调查分析了各类土壤性能，以便切实做到因地制宜种植作物，提高粮食产量。
    早在1月中旬，秦安县委乘各校放寒假期间，曾抽调了一批过去学过地质、物理、化学等有专门知识的人材，协同中心农技站的工作人员，组成了两个土壤调查研究工作组，携带各种化验、测验仪器和资料，分赴六个区的三十七个乡，对全县境内各种土壤分别高山、腰山、河谷两岸和川区四类地区，确定每乡取土八至十二处，用土壤成分速测器和土壤养分速测器，进行了细致地分析、化验，并与四十多位老农进行过五次座谈，最后查明全县共有黄壤土、栗钙土、红砂壤土、红粘土、鸡粪土五种。黄壤土主要分布在阳山与川道地区，约占全县总面积49％；栗钙土主要分布在阴山二阴地和部分川区，约占总面积38％；红砂壤土主要分布在近山脚处和部分川区，约占总面积0.4％。红粘土主要分布在一般破沟烂湾和沟壑的坡地上，约占总面积0.9％；鸡粪土在各乡镇一般山区都有，但数量很少，约占总面积0.2％。
    据调查，在全县各类土壤中，都含有石灰质。其中，含量较高的约占总耕地面积的35％，含量较少的约占15％；一般高坡、梁顶、阳坡，石灰质含量较低，下坡、川地、阴坡含量较高，并有个别地区碱性较强；各类土质所含氮、磷、钾亦各不同，黑土含氮量比其他土质较高，红土中氮、磷含量都很缺乏，黄土含氮量介于红、黑土之间。
    秦安县委根据以上调查分析，在秦安地区改良土壤，着重应增加氮肥：一、多上稀肥、人粪和厩肥，对增加土壤肥力很有作用，能促进土壤团粒结构，使土壤空气和土壤溶液中的含钙量与氧化碳含量增加，有利于降低碱性；二、多种豆科植物，能增加土壤氮素含量，同时采取豆科植物与禾本科植物轮作、间种，还能增加土壤团粒结构，保蓄水分；三、采取化肥硫酸铵与牲口粪混合施肥，也能增加土壤氮素。除此要大量保持与增加土壤中的水分，兴修水利，扩大灌溉，保持水土，避免土壤表层流失，在破沟、烂湾、荒山秃岭上要特别注意种树种草，营造防风林带，以防土壤表层流失和风蚀。
    从以上调查分析表明，在阳山、川道的黄壤土地区，最适宜种植玉米、高粱、糜谷、洋芋、小麦、洋麦；阴山二阴地和川地栗钙土地区最适宜种植莜麦和豆类作物；靠近山脚和部分川地的红壤土地区，适宜种植高粱、玉米、糜谷和小麦；一般红粘土地区，宜于种植小麦、洋麦、槎荞、槎糜等作物；山区鸡粪土种植玉米、高粱、洋芋、谷子、莜麦和豆类作物都很适宜。
    中共秦安县委，根据以上不同地区的土壤分布情况，已确定重点，配备干部，结合搞试验田，从今年开始要大力进行多点试验。另外，还在农业技术会议上专门研究了有关土壤问题，县委号召全县干部，要通过搞试验田，认真钻研土壤学，由外行变成内行，确实做到因地制宜，以保证今年的农业大丰收，争取提前完成县委提出的奋斗纲领。目前在重点地区，已开始了一系列的整地、施肥等试验工作。
