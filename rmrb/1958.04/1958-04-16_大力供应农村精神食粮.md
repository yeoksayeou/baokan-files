Vigorously Supply Spiritual Food to the Countryside
    Yao Di
    With the great leap forward in rural work across the country, cadres, intellectuals, and literate farmers in the vast countryside urgently need to learn new production technologies and improve their scientific and cultural knowledge through books. At the same time, with the increasing number of cadres being sent to lower levels and the growing number of middle and primary school graduates participating in agricultural production, the need for books in the countryside is even more pressing. Therefore, strengthening the supply of books to the countryside and better meeting the needs of rural readers is currently an urgent political task.
    Recently, driven by the great leap forward situation on all fronts across the country, Xinhua bookstores in various regions have also put forward great leap forward targets, and some regions have already begun to take practical actions, which is a very gratifying phenomenon.
    However, how can rural book distribution work take a great leap forward? To make a great leap forward, we must solve ideological problems. Comrades responsible for rural book distribution work must establish a sense of dedication to this work and understand that rural book distribution work directly serves rural work. Don't be reluctant to deal with popular reading materials because they are thin, cheap, and have low profits. We must resolutely implement the mass line, patiently do a good job of investigation and research, and supply books according to the needs of the masses. Only in this way can rural book distribution work take a leap forward.
    Today's report in this newspaper about the Beijing Branch of Xinhua Bookstore's Fengtai Sales Department improving its work in coordination with the great leap forward in rural work fully illustrates this problem. During this great leap forward, this sales department visited many rural cadres and farmers, investigated the needs of local readers, and realized that doing a good job in rural book distribution work is greatly beneficial to supporting agricultural production, thereby establishing confidence and revising the original order plan. The slogan they put forward is "Oriented to production, oriented to politics, popularization in depth, convenience for readers." From this, it can be seen that as long as there is a correct ideology and correct working methods, any work will add a force to socialist construction.

    大力供应农村精神食粮
    姚堤
    随着全国农村工作的大跃进，广大农村中的干部、知识分子和识字农民，都迫切地需要通过书籍来学习新的生产技术，提高科学和文化知识水平。同时，随着干部的下放，以及中、小学毕业生参加农业生产的逐年增多，农村中对图书的需要更加迫切。因此，加强农村图书供应工作，更好地满足农村读者的需要，是目前一项迫不及待的政治任务。
    最近，各地新华书店在全国各个阵线大跃进的形势推动下，也提出了跃进的指标，有些地区并已开始有了实际行动，这是十分可喜的现象。
    但是，农村图书发行工作如何跃进呢？要跃进，就必须解决思想上的问题。负责农村图书发行工作的同志要树立热爱这项工作的事业心，明确农村图书发行工作是直接服务于农村工作的。不要因为通俗读物本子薄、价钱低、利润小而不积极去经营。要坚决贯彻群众路线，耐心做好调查研究工作，根据群众的需要去供应书籍。这样，农村图书发行工作才可能跃进一步。
    本报今天发表的新华书店北京分店丰台门市部配合农村工作大跃进中改进自己工作的报道，充分地说明了这个问题。这个门市部在这次大跃进中，访问了当地的许多农村干部和农民，调查了当地读者的需要，认识到作好农村图书发行工作对支援农业生产大有益处，从而树立了信心，重新修订了原来的订货计划。他们提出的口号是“面向生产，面向政治，普及深入，便利读者”。由此可见，只要有了正确的思想和正确的工作方法，任何工作都会给社会主义建设增加一份力量。
