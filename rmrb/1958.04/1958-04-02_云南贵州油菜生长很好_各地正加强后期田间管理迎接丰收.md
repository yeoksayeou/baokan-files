    Yunnan and Guizhou Oilseed Rape Grows Well
    Various Regions are Strengthening Late-Stage Field Management to Welcome a Bumper Harvest
    (Our newspaper reports) Yunnan Province's more than 2.7 million mu of oilseed rape is growing well. Some areas have already begun harvesting, while most areas are still in the flowering stage and will be harvested by the end of April. According to the provincial Department of Agriculture's on-the-spot observations in various regions, the average yield per mu of oilseed rape in the province this year is estimated to increase by 23% compared to last year, and the total output will increase from more than 790,000 dan last year to 1.1 million dan.
    In Yunnan, from the second half of last year to this spring, most oilseed rape producing areas have not had rain since sowing, and insect pests have been very serious. Under the encouragement and promotion of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, leaders and the masses in various places broke away from the traditional idea that "oilseed rape is a lazy man's crop" and changed the past rough farming habits. They promptly took measures to combat drought, eliminate insects, and replant seedlings, and strengthened field management. Yuchun Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangchuan, a high-yielding oilseed rape county in the province, had all of its more than 1,000 mu of oilseed rape affected by drought this year. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the cooperative's farmers used more than 200 waterwheels to draw water from Xingyun Lake for irrigation. It is estimated that each mu can produce 280 jin, of which more than 50 mu can reach a high yield of 500 jin per mu. Recently, Yunnan has had two spring rains in succession, which are like timely rain for the oilseed rape that is in the flowering stage. Farmers are carrying out late-stage processing to welcome the bumper harvest. (Huang Changlu)
    (Our newspaper reports) Guizhou Province's more than 6.4 million mu of oilseed rape sown last winter is currently flowering and bearing fruit in all areas except for some areas in the high and cold mountainous areas of Bijie, which are still bolting. A bumper harvest is expected.
    Guizhou Province's oilseed rape sowing area this year has increased by more than 70% compared to last year. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of oilseed rape seeds, farmers of all ethnic groups are currently stepping up field management. In the Zunyi Special District, because 10% to 20% of the labor force was arranged, the oilseed rape has now been weeded four times and topdressed three times, and the fifth weeding and topdressing work is underway. In the high and cold mountainous areas of Bijie, which rarely had the habit of weeding and topdressing oilseed rape in the past, a general rush to weed and topdress once has now been carried out, and the second weeding and topdressing is beginning.

    云南贵州油菜生长很好
    各地正加强后期田间管理迎接丰收
    本报讯　云南省二百七十多万亩油菜生长良好，目前有的地区已开始收割，大部分地区还在落花，至4月下旬可收割完毕。据省农业厅在各地实地观察后估计，今年全省油菜平均单位面积产量可比去年增加23％，总产量将由去年的七十九万余担增加到一百一十万担。
    云南去年下半年和今年春季，大部分油菜产区从播种以后没下过雨，虫害也很严重。在农业生产大跃进的鼓舞推动下，各地领导和群众打破了“油菜是懒庄稼”的传统思想，改变了过去耕作粗放的习惯，及时进行了抗旱、除虫、补苗等措施，加强了田间管理。全省油菜丰产县江川的渔村农业社，今年一千余亩油菜全部受旱。全社农民在党支部领导下，用二百多架水车从星云湖中车水灌溉，估计每亩可产二百八十斤，其中五十多亩可达每亩五百斤的高额丰产。最近云南各地连下两场春雨，正在花期阶段的油菜如获甘露。农民正进行后期加工，迎接丰收。　（黄昌禄）
    本报讯　贵州省去冬播种的六百四十多万亩油菜，目前除毕节高寒山区部分地区还在抽苔外，其余地区都在开花结实，可望丰收。
    贵州省今年油菜播种面积比去年扩大了70％以上。各族农民为了争取油菜子丰收，目前正在加紧进行田间管理。遵义专区由于安排了10％—20％的劳动力，现在油菜已薅了四道，淋了三道，正在进行第五道薅淋工作。过去很少有薅淋油菜习惯的毕节高寒山区，目前已普遍突击薅淋了一道，并开始进行第二道薅淋。　（贺永丰）
