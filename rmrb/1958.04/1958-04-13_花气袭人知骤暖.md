    The scent of flowers attacks, knowing the sudden warmth.

    “The scent of flowers attacks, knowing the sudden warmth” is a line from the poem of the great Song Dynasty poet Lu You. Jia Baoyu once used this line to give his flower-named maid a name, Xiren (Attacking People). This line is very much in line with scientific principles, because the petals contain fragrant volatile oils. These volatile oils are thin liquids, and the fragrance of flowers is due to the volatilization of the volatile oils spreading out. When a liquid volatilizes, it needs to absorb heat. When the weather is warm and the temperature rises, the volatility of the oil greatly increases, so the fragrance is overflowing and the floral scent is fragrant. (Ji)

    花气袭人知骤暖
    “花气袭人知骤暖”，这是宋朝大诗人陆游的诗句。贾宝玉曾经用这句诗给他的一位姓花的侍女取了个袭人的名字。这句诗是非常合乎科学原理的，因为花瓣内含有带香味的挥发油类，这些挥发油是稀薄的液体，花的香气就是由于挥发油的挥发随着扩散开来。液体挥发时需要吸收热量，当天气暖和，气温升高，油的挥发力也就大大增加，因此香气四溢，花香扑鼻。（吉）
