Xinhua News Agency, 20th: Biological science research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will launch a series of research projects this year in coordination with the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

    In addition to continuing the comprehensive surveys, basic investigations of flora, fauna, and soil designated in the National Science and Technology Long-Range Plan, biological science research units will focus on the following issues raised in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft): increasing the production of rice and other major crops (wheat, cotton, etc.), storing agricultural products, improving soil and increasing soil fertility, investigating and controlling pests and diseases, increasing aquatic product production, forestry development, land reclamation, rural sideline occupations, and mountain area production. For example, in plant physiology, a systematic experimental research will focus on the physiological basis of high rice yield (such as irrigation, fertilization, drought resistance, etc.). Researchers in this area will also participate in the work of summarizing the experiences of high rice yield in Jiangsu Province's rice experimental fields and Tianjin Prefecture; in soil science, the problems of white soil in low-yield areas of the Taihu Lake Basin, saline-alkali soil in Northeast China and the lower reaches of the Yellow River, red soil in mountainous areas, and soil erosion will be studied, and soil maps or soil agrochemical maps of several provinces and regions will be compiled; in plant protection, the control of several serious diseases and insect pests of major crops, such as rice borers, locusts, aphids, wheat rust, and potato late blight, will continue to be studied, and surveys of diseases and insect pests of major crops will be conducted in cooperation with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; in microbiology, studies will be conducted in coordination with soil science on paddy soil, the improvement of soil fertility, bacterial fertilizers, and the application of antagonistic bacteria in agricultural production; in forestry, the forest types and forest regeneration in the Greater Khingan Mountains of Northeast China and the sand fixation and afforestation in the Zhongwei area of Gansu Province will be studied; in botany, investigations will be conducted on tropical and subtropical medicinal plants, wild oil crops, and pasture grasses; in zoology, investigations will be conducted on economic birds and animals, endoparasites of domestic animals in Inner Mongolia, and castor silkworms and tussah silkworms; in aquatic biology and marine biology, in addition to conducting aquatic resource surveys, studies will also be conducted on the southward movement of kelp, the cultivation of freshwater fish, spawning, the supply of fish fry, the prevention and control of fish diseases, the cultivation of freshwater algae, and agricultural utilization.
    In order to strengthen the close connection between biological science and agricultural production practice and to strengthen the cooperation between the relevant research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and agricultural research institutions, the Department of Biological Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences recently convened a joint meeting of the directors of the relevant research institutes and some senior researchers of both sides. At the meeting, the Chinese Academy of Sciences decided to transfer scientific personnel to participate in the rural work teams organized by the Academy of Agricultural Sciences and local agricultural science institutions to study key issues for increasing production. In order to coordinate national rice research work and systematically study key issues for increasing rice production, both parties agreed at the meeting to organize a Rice Research Working Committee, and preparations are now underway.

    生物学家下田找增产关键
    生物科学研究单位将进行农业科学研究工作
    新华社20日讯　中国科学院生物科学各研究单位今年配合全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）和农业生产大跃进，将展开一系列的研究工作。
    生物科学各研究单位除了继续进行全国科学技术远景规划指定的综合考察、动植物和土壤的基本调查以外，将着重对全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中提出的水稻和其他主要作物（麦、棉等）的增产、农产品贮藏、改良土壤提高土壤肥力、病虫害的调查和防治、水产品增产、有关林业发展、开荒、农村副业及山区生产等问题进行调查和试验研究。例如植物生理方面将着重围绕水稻丰产的生理基础（如灌溉、施肥、抗旱等生理）进行系统的试验研究，这方面的研究人员还将分别参加江苏省水稻试验田和天津专区的总结水稻丰产经验工作；土壤方面，将试验研究太湖流域低产区白土、东北及黄河下游盐碱土、山区红壤和土壤侵蚀等问题，编制若干省区的土壤图或土壤农化图；植物保护方面，要继续研究当前主要作物的若干严重病虫害，如稻螟、蝗虫、蚜虫、小麦锈病、马铃薯晚疫病的防治，并且同中国农业科学院合作进行主要农作物病虫害调查；微生物学方面，将配合土壤学研究水稻土、土壤肥力的提高、细菌肥料和抗生菌在农业生产中的应用；林业方面，要研究东北大兴安岭林型和森林更新以及甘肃中卫地区固沙造林问题；植物学方面，将进行热带、亚热带药用植物、野生油料作物、牧草等的调查研究；动物学方面，调查研究经济鸟兽、内蒙家畜内寄生虫和蓖麻蚕、柞蚕等；水生生物学和海洋生物学方面除进行水产资源调查以外，还要研究海带南移、淡水鱼的养殖、产卵、鱼苗供应、鱼病防治、淡水藻的养殖和农业利用等问题。
    为了加强生物科学与农业生产实践的密切联系以及加强中国科学院的有关研究机构同农业研究机构的合作，中国科学院生物学部同中国农业科学院不久前召开了双方有关研究所所长和部分高级研究人员的联席会议，会上中国科学院方面决定抽调科学人员参加农业科学院及地方农业科学机构组织的研究增产关键问题的下乡工作队。为了协调全国水稻研究工作和有计划地研究水稻增产关键问题，会上双方同意组织水稻研究工作委员会，现已开始筹备工作。
