    Those Who Value the Past Over the Present Should Wake Up
    Lu Ge

    During this "double-anti" movement, universities and scientific research institutions have exposed many instances of valuing the past over the present in teaching and research. When lecturing on literary theory, people always cite Dream of the Red Chamber and Dead Souls, but rarely give examples of modern literary works; they talk about Li Houzhu's lyrics and Lin Daiyu's voice and appearance with relish, but only mention Paul Kochakin in a few words. In education, they always quote Confucius and Comenius at length, but only briefly mention Marxist educational thought. The Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of Peking University wrote 35 papers on ancient times and 19 papers on modern times in five and a half years, but none on contemporary times. Last year, students majoring in archeology in the History Department of Peking University requested not to study modern history, and the relevant leaders approved this request; many historians believe that ancient history is strong tea, while modern history is light water. Similar examples are too numerous to mention in the current big-character posters of various schools.

    Why does this phenomenon of valuing the past over the present occur? Analysis reveals the following reasons: One is to value the past and belittle the present, believing that ancient times are promising, that studying ancient times makes one appear erudite, and that studying modern times does not count as scholarship and cannot lead to fame. One is to like the past and fear the present, believing that studying ancient times will not cause any problems because the ancients and ancient events are in the past, while studying modern times involves many unresolved issues, easily touching on current politics, and easily making mistakes. Another is to cherish the past and despise the present, believing that the present is not as good as the past, that everything was better in the past, reminiscing about the past, and not liking or being interested in all current affairs.

    Cherishing the past and despising the present, believing that everything is not as good as the past, is the feeling of a declining class, and it is obvious that this feeling should be criticized. Although there are still such people in the academic circles today, since these people are unwilling to follow the wheels of the times and always want to go backwards, they will sooner or later be abandoned by the times, so there is no need to say more here.

    As for the two views of valuing the past and belittling the present and liking the past and fearing the present, although everyone will think they are wrong when stated clearly, there are many people who agree with them in private.

    Valuing the past and belittling the present is the traditional thinking of literati and scholars in China's feudal era. "Writing must be in the style of the Qin and Han dynasties, poetry must be in the style of the Tang dynasty," and "speaking must refer to the Three Dynasties" has indeed been the case since ancient times, and it still has a great influence today. For example, a professor at Beijing Normal University believes that the most scholarly thing is archeology, while studying modern things does not count as scholarship. In fact, this so-called idea that ancient times are promising and that studying modern times does not count as scholarship is not in line with reality. Does it mean that Marx's writing of "Das Kapital" in the capitalist era, Lenin's writing of "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" in the imperialist era, and Chairman Mao's many articles on the Chinese revolution have no value and do not count as scholarship? The ultimate goal of all learning is nothing more than how to promote the development of society. Of course, ancient things must be studied. Chairman Mao also wants us to study history, but the purpose of studying ancient times is to serve the present, to "review the old and know the new." It is of course valuable to achieve results in studying ancient things, but it cannot be said that studying modern things is meaningless. On the contrary, it should be more meaningful. Modern and contemporary societies are developing rapidly, and there is much to be done in studying literature, philosophy, history, and other social sciences. Modern history is by no means light water. Take the post-liberation China as an example. In these short years, how great political, economic, and cultural changes have taken place, how profound social changes have occurred, how many materials are worth collecting, how many problems are worth studying, and how many experiences are worth summarizing. How can it be said that there is nothing to be done, and how can it be said that these are not scholarship? In fact, this view that studying modern things does not count as scholarship is precisely treating the study of modern things as a political formality, as a current affairs article. This is precisely a manifestation of the bourgeoisie intellectuals' neglect of politics and disdain for reality.

    The idea of liking the past and fearing the present also exists among many experts and professors. Some people have praised Hu Feng and recommended "Battle in the Lowlands" to students in the past, and are still taking it as a warning. But is this the "present" that is terrible? Unless there is a place to escape reality, people who are born in the era of reality cannot avoid having love and hate for reality, and affirming or denying it. Fear is useless. The problem lies in exercising one's own position, viewpoint, and ability to analyze problems. If an error occurs in studying a problem, one can only blame oneself for not working hard enough, and one should work harder. The attitude of doing scholarship should be to seek truth from facts. It is inevitable to make some mistakes in research work due to one's own level. As long as one continues to study and constantly correct them, making a small mistake will not harm one's lifelong reputation. On the contrary, avoiding current practical problems in order to avoid making mistakes and drilling into a dead end is an even bigger mistake. Moreover, as professors and mentors, it is an irresponsible attitude towards young people to avoid talking about current practical problems for fear of making mistakes and letting students explore these problems on their own. Besides, engaging in ancient studies does not necessarily mean not making mistakes. The coffin lid does not necessarily mean the final judgment. If one's position and viewpoint are not correct, it is difficult to avoid making mistakes even when engaging in ancient studies. Isn't Wu Xun an ancient person? Why do some people still make mistakes on him?

    Of course, opposing the idea of valuing the past and belittling the present does not mean that we will not study ancient times. In addition to the main force in the academic circles should be used to study current practical problems, ancient times should also be studied. The problem lies in whether we look at ancient times from a modern perspective and whether we study ancient times from a modern perspective. If so, it is "reviewing the old and knowing the new," it is making the past serve the present, and it is valuing the present and belittling the past. On the contrary, if it is just carrying out some meaningless and tedious textual research, such as studying the history of ancient Chinese board games, it is completely unnecessary.

    Therefore, the exposure and criticism of the phenomenon of valuing the past and belittling the present in various universities and scientific research institutions is very beneficial. Through this exposure and criticism, the academic circles will focus more attention on studying current practical problems, and at the same time, it will enable people who study ancient times to jump out of the circle of ancient times and come into contact with reality, so that the study of ancient problems can serve reality. This will be of great significance to the great leap forward in science and culture.

    厚古薄今的人醒来
    鲁歌
    在这次“双反”运动中，高等学校和科学研究机关揭发了许多教学和研究上厚古薄今的情况。讲文艺理论总是引证红楼梦、死魂灵，而很少举现代文学作品为例；讲李后主的词、林黛玉的声音笑貌，津津有味，而讲到保尔柯察金则只寥寥数语。教育学讲孔子、夸美纽斯总是长篇征引，而提到马克思主义的教育思想却一掠而过。北大中国哲学史教研室五年半写了关于古代的论文三十五篇，关于近代的论文十九篇，而现代的一篇也没有。北大历史系考古专业同学去年要求不学近代现代史，有关领导也就批准了这个要求；许多历史学者都认为古代史是浓茶，近代史是淡水。类似这样的事例在目前各学校的大字报中是举不胜举。
    为什么会产生这种厚古薄今的现象呢？分析起来，可以有下列几种原因：一种是重古轻今，认为古代有搞头，研究古代才显得博学，研究近代算不了学问，成不了名。一种是喜古怕今，认为研究古代，反正古人古事已成过去，不会出什么问题，研究近代，许多事情未有定论，容易涉及当前政治，容易犯错误。又一种是怀古鄙今，认为今不如昔，一切都是过去的好，缅怀往昔，发思古之幽情，而对一切现实事物看不顺眼或不感兴趣。
    怀古鄙今，认为一切都是今不如昔，这是一种没落阶级的感情，这种感情之应该批判是很明显的。尽管今天学术界中也还有这样的人，但是这种人既不愿跟着时代的车轮前进，总想向后倒退，那末他们迟早总将被时代抛弃，这里且不必多说。
    至于重古轻今和喜古怕今这两种看法，尽管明白说来，大家也会认为不对，但私下赞同者却是大有人在。
    重古轻今是我国封建时代文人学者的传统思想。“文必秦汉、诗必盛唐”，“言必称三代”，确是自古已然，现在也还有很大影响。例如北京师大某教授就认为最有学问的东西是考古，而研究现代的东西算不得学问。其实，这种所谓古代有搞头，研究现代算不得学问的说法是不符合实际的。难道说在资本主义时代的马克思写出“资本论”、在帝国主义时代的列宁写出“帝国主义论”、以及毛主席许多论述中国革命的文章没有价值、算不了学问吗？一切学问的最终目的无非是如何促进社会的发展。古代的事当然要研究，毛主席也要我们研究历史，但研究古代的目的在于现代，在于“温故而知新”。研究古代的东西有了成绩，当然有价值，但不能说研究现代的东西就没有意义，相反地，应该是更有意义。近代现代社会发展迅速，不论研究文学、研究哲学、研究历史和其他社会科学都大有可为。近代史决不是淡水。就拿解放后的中国来说，在这短短几年中，政治、经济、文化经过了多么大的变革，社会发生了多么深刻的变化，有多少材料值得收集，有多少问题值得研究，有多少经验值得总结，怎能说没有搞头，又怎能说这些不是学问呢？其实这种认为研究近代东西不算学问的说法，就是将研究近代的学问当做政治性的应景的东西，当作运动文章，这正是资产阶级知识分子忽视政治、轻视现实的一种表现。
    喜古怕今的思想，在许多专家教授中也是存在的。有人因为过去曾经向学生赞扬过胡风，推荐过“洼地里的战役”，因而至今引以为戒。但是，这难道是“今”的可怕吗？除非有地方可以逃避现实，生在现实时代的人，总不免要对现实有所爱憎，有所肯定或否定。怕是没有用的，问题在于锻炼自己的立场观点和分析问题的能力。研究一个问题发生错误，只能责备自己功夫不够，就应该再下功夫。做学问的态度应该实事求是，限于自己的水平，在研究工作中出些错误也是难免的，只要继续研究，不断改正，出了一点错误也并不有害于一世令名。反之，为了怕犯错误而不敢接触当前实际问题，钻到牛角尖去，这却是更大的错误。而且作为教授、导师因怕犯错误避而不谈当前现实问题，而让学生自己摸索着去碰这些问题，也是一种对青年不负责任的态度。何况，搞古代也不一定不犯错误，盖棺并不一定就是论定。立场观点不正确，搞古代也难免犯错误的。武训岂不是古人吗，为什么还有人在他身上犯了错误呢？
    当然，反对厚古薄今的思想，并不是说我们就不研究古代了。除了学术界的主要力量应该用于研究当前现实外，古代也要研究，问题在于我们是否以现代的观点去看古代，是否从现代的角度去研究古代，如果是，就是“温故知新”，就是使古为今用，就是厚今薄古。反之，如果仅仅是进行些毫无意义的繁琐的考证，如研究中国古代博奕史之类，那是完全不必要的。
    因此，目前各高等学校和科学研究中对于厚古薄今的现象的揭露和批判是十分有益的。通过这一次的揭露和批判，将使学术界把注意力更加集中于研究当前的现实问题，同时也使得研究古代的人能够跳出古代圈子，接触实际，使古代问题的研究为现实服务，这对于科学文化的大跃进将有莫大的意义。
