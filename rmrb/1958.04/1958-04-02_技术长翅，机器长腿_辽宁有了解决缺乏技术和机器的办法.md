Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st April: Liaoning Province has adopted a collaborative approach of "technology grows wings, machines grow legs" to solve the difficulties of lacking technology and machinery in the Great Leap Forward of water conservancy construction.

“Technology grows wings” means: people with technology fly to places lacking technology, and places lacking technology send people to places with technology to learn. There are two main forms of "technology grows wings." One is to exchange labor, with old paddy field areas sending farmer technicians to new paddy field areas to teach techniques while working; new paddy field areas send capable and astute commune members to old paddy field areas to learn techniques, replacing the farmers who have been sent out to teach. In this way, the technology of the old paddy field areas can quickly spread throughout the new paddy field areas, and the local production will not be affected by too many farmers going out to teach techniques. The other form is to take advanced places as schools, concentrating leading cadres and masses from the surrounding areas to participate in construction or operation on-site, with local advanced workers or technicians providing explanations and technical guidance. After completion, inspections and evaluations are carried out to point out the advantages and disadvantages, spreading technology while doing. From mid-February to the end of March, more than 900 people have been exchanged under the unified organization of the province, and more than 20,000 people have been exchanged through self-negotiation by various regions. In March, Antung, Xinbin and Lingyuan counties trained more than 4,000 people for various counties at some water conservancy construction sites. This method of "technology grows wings" has now been extended to all aspects of manure fermentation, soil and water conservation, and fruit tree cultivation.

The practice of "machines grow legs" is: to install wheels on pumping machinery or mount them on trailers, and during the intermittent time of pumping water in location A, they are pulled to location B for use; when a sudden pumping task is encountered in one place, machinery is promptly mobilized to provide support. In this way, each pumping machine can fully exert its effectiveness. Jinzhou and Antung districts are organizing blacksmiths and carpenters to install wheels on various pumping machines.

This year, Liaoning Province has newly built more than 90,000 water conservancy projects and newly opened 5 million mu of paddy fields. In Jinzhou and Tieling, two districts that previously grew relatively little rice, the paddy field area has suddenly increased more than four times. In Antung and Liaoyang, two old paddy field areas, the paddy field area has also increased by one to two times. All regions – especially new paddy field areas – felt a great shortage of technical strength and equipment. The above-mentioned collaborative approach was generated under these circumstances.

### “技术长翅，机器长腿”  辽宁有了解决缺乏技术和机器的办法

    “技术长翅，机器长腿”
    辽宁有了解决缺乏技术和机器的办法
    据新华社沈阳1日电　辽宁省采取“技术长翅、机器长腿”的协作办法，解决水利建设大跃进中缺技术、缺器械的困难。
    “技术长翅”是：有技术的人向缺技术的地方飞，缺技术的地方派人向有技术的地方飞。“技术长翅”的主要形式有两种。一种是互相交换劳动力，由老水田区向新水田区派出农民技术手，边劳动边传授技术；新水田区派出精明强干的社员到老水田区学习技术，代替被派出传授技术的农民劳动。这样老水田区的技术可以迅速飞遍新水田区，而且不致因出去传授技术的农民多了而影响本地生产。另一种形式是以先进的地方为学校，集中周围的领导干部和群众到现场参加施工或操作，由当地的先进工作者或技术人员进行解说和技术指导，做完了就检查评比，指出优缺点，边做边传播技术。从2月中旬到3月末，由省统一组织劳动力交换的已有九百多人，由各地区自行协商交换的有两万多人。安东、新宾、凌源三县3月份在一些水利建设工地上，就为各县训练了四千多人。这种“技术长翅”的办法现在已经推行到粪肥发酵、水土保持、果树栽培等各个方面。
    “机器长腿”的做法是：把抽水机械装上车轮或装在拖车上，在甲地抽水的间歇时间，就拉到乙地使用；在一个地方遇到突击性的抽水任务时，就及时调集机器支援。这样就使每一台抽水机器都能充分发挥效能。锦州、安东两专区正组织铁匠、木匠给各种抽水机械安装车轮。
    今年辽宁省新修水利工程九万多处，新开水稻田五百万亩，锦州、铁岭两个过去种植水稻较少的专区，稻田面积突然增加四倍以上，安东、辽阳两个老水田区，稻田面积也增加了一倍到两倍，各地区——特别是新水田区，都大感技术力量和器械不足。上述的协作办法就是在这种情况下产生的。（附图片）
