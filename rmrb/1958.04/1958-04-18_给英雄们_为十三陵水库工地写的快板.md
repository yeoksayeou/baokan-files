To you who carry the sand, you are like ten thousand flying shuttles, you are like a long river, you carry the happiness of a thousand generations, carrying the great lock that will confine the flood.

To those who dig the earth, the sky is higher than yesterday, the moon is smaller than yesterday, the earth is thinner than yesterday, and the red flag smiles better than yesterday. To the fighters who push the carts, the carts can't hold it, the rails can't bear it, they come and go like a gust of wind, wanting to push the mountain away.

To the director of the supply and marketing cooperative, getting up in the middle of the night, forgetting the cold and the long road, delivering four buckets of kerosene, his clothes soaked with sweat. No oil was missing from the two teams, the construction site was brightly lit; smiling as he bid farewell and returned home, welcoming the light of dawn.

To a worker who went into the icy river, you brushed aside the wind and snow with one hand, you shattered the ice bricks with one foot, you took the lead, like shooting an arrow, the wooden bridge was built ahead of schedule, and the ice and snow turned into spring. To a demobilized soldier, returning to his long-separated hometown, before the mat on the kang was warm, he hurried to the construction site, moving a mountain in a day. Once a hero, today a model worker, in your conversation and laughter, the landscape has been changed.

To a female worker, the wedding date is as sweet as honey, longed for for many years, when the reservoir started construction, her enthusiasm was like a flame. Telling her boyfriend, the wedding date will be delayed a few days; the flood waits for no one, we'll reunite after the completion.

    给英雄们
    ——为十三陵水库工地写的快板
    沙鸥
  给挑砂土的你们像万只飞梭，你们像一条长河，你们挑着千代的幸福。挑着关牢洪水的大锁。
  给挖土的天空比昨天更高，月亮比昨天更小，地皮比昨天更薄，红旗笑得比昨天更好。给推斗车的战士斗车装不了，铁轨受不了，来去一股风，要把山推跑。
  给供销社主任半夜披衣起床，忘了夜寒路长，四桶煤油送到，大汗湿了衣裳。两队没有缺油，工地灯光明亮；含笑告别回家，迎着满天曙光。
    给一位下冰河的民工你一手拂开风雪，你一脚踏碎冰砖，你带头走了一步，像射出一支飞箭，木桥提前搭好，冰雪化为春天。给一位转业军人回到久别的家乡，炕席还没有睡暖，急忙来到工地，一天搬走一山，当年一条英雄，今天一位模范，在你谈笑间，山河已改变。
  给一位女民工婚期似蜜甜，盼望好几年，水库动了工，热情像火焰。告诉小伙子，婚期迟几天；洪水不等人，完工再团圆。
