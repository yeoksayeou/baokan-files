New Tools Require New Labor Organization
    Xinqiao Township, Fuyang Solves New Contradictions in Technological Reform

    (Our report) With the large-scale creation and widespread use of new production tools, how to organize labor so that the enthusiasm of laborers matches the effectiveness of new tools and improves work efficiency is a new problem that has emerged in technological innovation. Xinqiao Township in Fuyang County, Anhui Province, has created good experiences in solving this new problem.

    During the large-scale water conservancy construction in Xinqiao Township, more than 1,200 pieces of 13 types of new soil transportation tools such as pulley carts and "wobbly carts" were used. Due to the rational arrangement of labor organization on the construction site, the role of new tools was fully utilized, avoiding wasted work, and work efficiency was greatly improved, with the average daily work efficiency per person increasing from 3.5 cubic meters to 14.7 cubic meters.

    What tools to use for what project is the first thing Xinqiao Township paid attention to. Practice has proved that improper use of tools will waste labor. Yingguang Fourth Cooperative used double-track pulley carts, which have a relatively large soil carrying capacity and can climb steep slopes, on the Lizigou construction site, which was more than two li long, and the work efficiency per person per day was 10 to 12 cubic meters; however, when they were used in deep ponds with mud, they were not as effective as the "wobbly carts." For example, the capstan cart is suitable for flat ground. When it was used on the Jihe construction site, it once created a record of up to 25 cubic meters of soil per person per day, but when it was used on construction sites with steep slopes and short transportation distances, it became powerless. Based on practical experience, Xinqiao Township arranged soil transportation tools on different construction sites according to the different properties of the tools, so that they could be used to their best advantage and maximize their work efficiency.

    Xinqiao Township also paid special attention to matching tools with people. They regarded this as the central content of adjusting labor organization. The distribution of labor should not only be reasonable in quantity, but also reasonable in the combination of full and semi-labor. When a production team of Yingguang Third Cooperative was digging Zhaihoutang, they used four female laborers to push the capstan of a capstan "wobbly cart." Because there were too many people, they were crowded together, and the capstan was jammed, so they had to take small steps, and the work efficiency per person per day was only 4.3 cubic meters; while another production team that also used a capstan "wobbly cart" only used two people to push the capstan, and they took big steps and pushed straight, and the work efficiency per person per day was 9.3 cubic meters. For example, when using foot-operated double-track pulley carts in Luzhuang North Pond, the work efficiency was 6.3 cubic meters per person per day due to the unreasonable allocation of labor on the first day, with three semi-laborers stepping on the cart; on the second day, a male full laborer was replaced among the three semi-laborers, and the work efficiency per person per day increased to more than 9 cubic meters.

    In addition to assigning fixed cadres to sub-sections and fixed tools to sub-projects, Xinqiao Township also assigned fixed labor to sub-tools. Because the use of new tools requires a certain degree of skill, allowing people who are familiar with the performance of a certain tool to use it fixedly will become more and more skilled in operation and the work efficiency will be higher. After the Ren Zhuang production team of Yingguang First Cooperative fixed labor to sub-tools, the work efficiency of the entire team of eleven people increased from the original 4.8 cubic meters per person per day to 15 cubic meters. If the person who is fixed to use the tool needs to be transferred, the original operator should give specific guidance to the novice.

    In the progress of the project, the steel wire of the aerial soil transporter often becomes loose and needs to be tightened; or the boom is far away from the place where the soil is dug and needs to be moved; especially when the construction site is changed, the tools need to be moved, and some tools have many parts, and the handling and installation will take half a day. If these tasks are asked to be done by the members who have already implemented the contract task, contract time, and contract work points, many people are unwilling. The seven agricultural cooperatives in Xinqiao Township organized 112 iron and wood workers into 12 repair teams, and at the same time, more than 40 breeders with strong physical strength led livestock and carts to form 14 transportation and installation teams to work on the construction site. This ensures the smooth progress of the project and the improvement of project efficiency.

    新工具需要新的劳动组织
    阜阳辛桥乡解决了技术改革中的新矛盾
    本报讯　随着新生产工具的大量创造和普遍使用，怎样进行劳动组合，使劳动者的劳动积极性和新工具的效能相适应，提高工作的效率，是技术革新中出现的新问题。安徽省阜阳县辛桥乡为解决这个新问题创造了良好的经验。
    辛桥乡在大修水利的过程中，使用了滑轮车、歪歪车等十三种运土新工具共一千二百多件。由于合理地安排了工地上的劳动组合，充分发挥了新工具的作用，避免了窝工现象，工作效率大大提高，每人每日的平均工效由三点五方提高到十四点七方。
    什么工程用什么工具，这是辛桥乡首先注意的事情。实践证明：工具使用不得当，就会浪费劳动力。颍光四社把运土量比较大、能爬陡坡的双轨滑轮车，放在二里多长的里字沟工地上使用，每人每天工效合十方到十二方；可是把它拿到有稀泥的深塘里使用，就没有歪歪车的效果好。又如绞缆大车适用于平地，在季河工地上使用，曾创造过每人每日工效高达二十五方土的纪录，但在坡度大、运距近的工地上使用起来；就变得无能为力。根据实践的经验，辛桥乡按照工具的不同性能，在不同的工地上安排运土工具，使它们各得其所，发挥最大的工作效能。
    辛桥乡还特别注意什么工具配什么人。他们把这一点作为调整劳动组合的中心内容。劳动力的分配，不仅要数量合理，整半劳动力的搭配也要合理。颍光三社一个生产队在挖砦后塘时，曾经用四个女劳动力推一架绞缆歪歪车的绞杠，由于人多，互相拥挤，杠子被蹩住，只好走小步子，每人每日工效只合四点三方；而同样使用绞缆歪歪车的另一个生产队，只用两人推绞杠，步子迈的开，推的直跑，每人每日工效合九点三方。又如在卢庄北大塘使用脚踏双轨滑轮车，头一天由于劳动力搭配不合理，三个半劳动力踩车，每人每日工效合六点三方；第二天，在三个半劳动力中换上一个男整劳动力，每人每日工效就提高到九方多。
    辛桥乡除了分工段固定干部、分工程固定工具以外，还分工具固定劳动力。因为使用新工具都需要有一定程度的技术，让熟悉某一件工具性能的人来固定使用它，就会愈操作愈熟练，工效愈高。颍光一社任庄生产队分工具固定劳动力以后，全队十一个人由原来每人每日工效四点八方提高到十五方。固定使用工具的人如果需要调动时，原操作人应对新手做具体指导。
    在工程进展中，常会发生空中运土器的铁丝松了，需要把它弄紧；或者吊杆离挖土的地方远了，需要搬动一下；特别是工地变换了，工具要搬动，而有些工具的部件很多，搬运和安装就要小半天。这些活如果叫已经实行包任务、包时间、包工分的社员来做，许多人是不乐意的。辛桥乡的七个农业社把一百一十二个铁、木工组成十二个修理组，同时由四十多个体力较强的饲养员，带上牲口和大车，组成十四个运输和安装组，在工地上巡回工作。这样就保证了工程的顺利进行和工程效率的提高。
