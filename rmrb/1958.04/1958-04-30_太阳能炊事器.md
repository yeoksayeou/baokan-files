    Solar Cooker
    The Shanghai Shunxin Electrical Machinery Factory, a factory specializing in the production of solar energy equipment, has recently successfully trial-produced China's first metal-structured, parabolic reflector solar cooker. The biggest advantage of this cooker is that the focus of the light is more concentrated. In the past, it took twenty-five minutes to cook rice with a wooden-structured, plane mirror solar cooker, but now it only takes twelve to eighteen minutes.

    太阳能炊事器
    专门生产太阳能器械的工厂——上海顺新机电厂，最近试制成功我国第一台金属结构、抛物线反射镜太阳能炊事器。这种炊事器最大的优点是光线焦点比较集中；过去木结构、平面镜太阳能炊事器烧饭需要二十五分钟，现在只需要十二到十八分钟。
