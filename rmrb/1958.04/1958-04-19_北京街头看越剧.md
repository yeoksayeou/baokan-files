Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Yesterday afternoon, the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe, currently visiting Beijing, gave two street performances in Tiananmen Square and in front of the Qianmen Railway Station, with drums and strings filling the air.

"Seize the sunny days, rush through the cloudy days, count light rain as good weather, use gasoline lamps as daylight, for the sake of the Great Leap Forward in production, one day is worth two"..., the actors conveyed the Zhejiang farmers' heroic leap forward songs to the people of Beijing. They also performed the living newspaper play "No Spitting," the dance "Good News," and the Yue Opera "A Thousand Miles a Day," which depicts three generations of a farming family in Zhejiang working hard to achieve a thousand-jin commune.

This unique performance attracted more and more spectators, including workers, soldiers, staff, students, elderly women with white hair, and women holding children.... Many people stood on benches and on the back seats of bicycles, watching intently, with applause and laughter constantly erupting from the crowd. An old man clapped and shouted to the actors, "You are great, thank you." After the performance, the actors immediately held hands with the audience and asked them to offer criticism of the performance.

The Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe has long toured factories and rural areas. They recently came to Beijing and will officially perform at the Beijing Theater starting from the 19th. In addition to performing in the theater, they will also bring the performances to factories, schools, and construction sites, and will continue to perform several more times on the streets of Beijing.

    北京街头看越剧
    新华社18日讯　18日下午，北京天安门广场和前门车站广场上锣鼓齐鸣，弦歌悦耳，正在北京访问的杭州市越剧团在这里举行了两场街头演出。
    “赶晴天，抢阴天，斜风细雨算好天，汽油灯下当白天，为了生产大跃进，一天顶两天”……，演员们把浙江农民豪迈的跃进歌声转达给北京人民。他们还演出了活报剧“不许随地吐痰”和舞蹈“喜报”以及描写浙江一家农民祖孙三代为争取达到千斤社而苦干的越剧“一日千里”等。
    这场别开生面的演出吸引着越来越多的观众，他们当中有工人、战士、职员、学生、白发的老大娘和抱着孩子的妇女……，许多人站在板凳上和自行车的后座上出神地观看，人群中不断发出掌声和笑声。一个老汉一边鼓掌一边对演员们大声地说：“你们是好样的，谢谢你们”。演出结束了，演员们马上同观众手拉手地谈了起来，请他们对演出提出批评。
    杭州市越剧团过去长期在工厂、农村巡回演出，他们最近来到北京，将从19日起在北京剧场正式公演。除在剧场演出外，他们还将把戏送到工厂、学校、工地去，并且将继续在北京街头演出几场。
