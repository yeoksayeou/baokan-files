Our newspaper, Xi'an, April 28th, (Reporter Yi Xiao) reports: After inspecting the city's first quarter industrial production and the progress of the "Two Antis" movement, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to launch the masses in all factories and mines, combined with rectification, to conduct extensive airing of views, big contending, and big debating, to thoroughly examine and revise the current unreasonable rules and regulations in a revolutionary spirit.

After analyzing the city's "Two Antis" movement and industrial production, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the main problem in current industrial production is that in the continuous leap forward of production, production leadership and management are rigidly adhering to some unreasonable rules and regulations, which have not been changed in time, seriously restricting the development of production. The reason for this situation is that the conservative thinking of leading cadres and office cadres has not been completely eliminated. They only see equipment and rules and regulations, and do not see the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. When unreasonable rules and regulations hinder production, they advocate pulling the leaping production backward to adapt to the old production management methods and systems, instead of changing the old management methods and systems to adapt to the requirements of production leap forward.

The Xi'an Machinery Manufacturing Plant is a representative example. Many of the plant's rules and regulations cannot adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in production. According to their system, arranging the production of a new product requires going through seven departments, ten procedures, and two or three months. They accepted a batch of orders from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and after completing the procedures for three months, they have not yet been delivered for production. The inspection of materials entering the factory takes a month, and even urgent materials take seven days. The head of the plant's planning and dispatching department, without seeing the fact that the labor efficiency of workers has been greatly improved, looked at the problem with an old perspective, believing that the leap forward target is 46% greater than the effective working hours, and unless overtime is worked or workers and equipment are increased, a leap forward cannot be achieved. Therefore, he advocated reducing the leap forward plan by 25%.

Similar situations are common in other factories. According to preliminary investigations, each of the state-owned Northwest cotton textile factories has four or five hundred rules and regulations, about half of which need to be revised or abolished. These factories, according to the Northwest Textile Industry Administration's standard of looking after machines, stipulate that each fine yarn worker should look after 800 spindles, and each weaving worker should look after 24 looms. Because of rigidly adhering to this outdated rule, although the technical level of workers has improved a lot in the past two years, the labor productivity has not increased accordingly. The approval and implementation of a rationalization proposal in the No. 5 State-owned Cotton Mill requires fourteen procedures. A proposal for an automatic stopping device submitted by the cleaning workshop of the No. 3 Mill in 1956 has not been realized until now. The No. 3 Mill's cleanliness work system alone has one hundred and seventy-four clauses, of which only five are actually implemented now. The city's workers have put forward three million opinions in the "Two Antis," 70% of which have been resolved, and the main unresolved issue is the problem of rules and regulations.

After studying the above situation, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to take launching workers to reform rules and regulations in a revolutionary spirit as the central link in the rectification work after the "Two Antis" movement, to further overcome the conservative thinking of factory and mine leaders and department, technical personnel, so that management work can catch up with the production leap forward target. To this end, the Municipal Committee has organized on-site meetings in the machinery, electrical, and textile industries to conduct extensive airing of views on rules and regulations and conservative thinking in leadership. For problems that can be solved immediately, such as the standard machine watching quota of textile factories and some unreasonable welfare systems, they were immediately announced to be abolished.

Now, in some factories with faster progress, the reform of unreasonable rules and regulations has formed a mass movement and has taken practical measures. The Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau organized extensive airing of views, big contending, and big debating, and conducted on-site experiments, abolishing and modifying three hundred and forty-two unreasonable rules and regulations, and another twenty-one were reported to higher authorities for resolution. For example, the locomotive traction quota between Tongchuan and Xi'an was set too low. With the increase in transportation tasks, the drivers asked to increase the quota; however, the leaders believed that the roadbed was not good and the track type was complex, and there was no theoretical basis for traction calculation, so they did not accept their request. Later, the drivers continuously created new records that greatly exceeded the original quota, proving the unreasonableness of the old traction quota with powerful facts. Recently, the Railway Sub-bureau immediately conducted on-site experiments and increased the traction quota based on the actual situation. The workers of the state-owned Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Plant, in the airing of views, used the actual situation of on-site production to point out the unreasonable phenomena in working hour calculation, and used concrete facts to overthrow the basis of the planning and dispatching department head's so-called leap forward target being 46% greater than the effective working hours. This made the planning section chief understand the thinking. He not only no longer demanded to lower the leap forward target, but agreed to increase it by about 50%. According to the old regulations for the trial production of new products at the state-owned Qing'an Machinery Factory, it would take seven departments, ten procedures, and two months to deliver to production. When they recently trial-produced tractors, they changed the original procedures, and representatives from various departments worked together in a centralized office, solving problems on the spot. Two thousand drawings were distributed to the workshop in only three days, greatly speeding up the production speed. (Attached picture)

### 用大无畏精神为工业跃进开道  把陈规陋矩一扫而光  西安决定发动职工改革不合理的规章制度

    用大无畏精神为工业跃进开道
    把陈规陋矩一扫而光
    西安决定发动职工改革不合理的规章制度
    本报西安28日电　记者伊晓报道：中共西安市委检查了全市第一季度工业生产和“双反”运动的进展情况之后，决定在各厂矿结合整改发动群众大鸣大放大争大辩，以革命精神彻底检查修订现行不合理的规章制度。
    中共西安市委在分析了全市“双反”运动和工业生产的情况后认为：目前工业生产的主要问题是在生产不断跃进中，生产领导管理上死守着一些不合理的规章制度，没有及时改变，严重地束缚着生产的发展。造成这种状况的原因是领导干部和科室干部的保守思想还没有彻底扫除。他们只看到设备和规章制度，看不到工人的积极性和创造性。当不合理的规章制度障碍了生产时，他们主张把跃进的生产拉向后退来适应旧的生产管理方法和制度，而不去改变旧的管理方法和制度来适应生产跃进的要求。
    西安机械制造厂便是一个具有代表性的例子。这个厂的许多规章制度都不能适应生产大跃进的新情况。按照他们的制度，安排一种新产品的生产就要经过七个科、十道手续、两三个月。他们接受石油工业部的一批订货，办了三个月的手续还未交付生产。材料入厂检验要一个月的时间，急料也得七天。这个厂的计划调度科长，没有看到工人劳动效率已经很快提高了的事实，而用旧的眼光看问题，认为跃进指标比有效工时大46％，除非加班加点或增加工人设备就不能跃进。因此，他主张把跃进计划降低25％。
    类似情况在其他厂也普遍存在。国营西北各棉纺厂，根据初步调查，哪一个厂都有四、五百种规章制度，其中需要修订和废除的约有一半左右。这些厂根据西北纺织工业管理局的标准看台数，规定细纱工每人看八百锭，织布工每人看布机二十四台。由于死守这一陈规，虽然两年来工人技术水平已经提高了很多，而劳动生产率却没有相应的增长。国棉五厂一条合理化建议的批准施行要经过十四道手续。三厂清花车间1956年提出的一件自动停车装置的建议，到现在也没有实现。三厂的一项整洁工作制度就有一百七十四条条文，现在实际执行的只有五条。全市职工在“双反”中提出来了三百万条意见，70％已经解决，其中没有解决的主要就是规章制度问题。
    中共西安市委研究上述情况，确定把发动职工以革命的精神改革规章制度作为在“双反”运动后整改工作的中心环节，进一步克服厂矿领导和科室、技术人员中的保守思想，使管理工作赶上生产跃进指标。为此，市委已经组织了机械、电工和纺织三个行业的现场会议，就规章制度和领导上的保守思想展开大鸣大放。对可以马上解决的问题，比如纺织厂的标准看台定额和一些不合理的福利制度，当场宣布废除。
    现在有些进展较快的工厂，改革不合理的规章制度已经形成群众性的运动，并且采取了实际的措施。西安铁路分局组织大鸣大放大争大辩和进行现场试验，废除和修改了三百四十二项不合理的规章制度，另有二十一条报上级解决。如铜川到西安间机车牵引定额规定过低，随着运输任务的加大，司机们要求提高定额；而领导认为路基不好，道轨类型复杂，没有牵引计算学理论根据，没有接受他们的要求。后来司机们连续创造了大大超过原定额的新纪录，用有力的事实证明旧牵引定额的不合理。最近铁路分局马上到现场进行试验，根据实际情况提高了牵引定额。国营西安机器制造厂工人在鸣放中，用以现场生产的实际情况，指出工时计算上的不合理现象，并用具体事实推翻计划调度科长所谓跃进指标比有效工时大46％的根据。这就使计划科长搞通了思想。他不仅不再要求降低跃进指标，反而同意再提高约50％。国营庆安机器厂按照新产品试制的旧规定，要经过七个科室、十道手续、历时两月才能交付生产。他们最近试制拖拉机时，就改变了原来规程，各科室派代表集中办公，有问题当场解决，二千张图纸只用了三天就下达到车间，大大加快了生产速度。（附图片）
