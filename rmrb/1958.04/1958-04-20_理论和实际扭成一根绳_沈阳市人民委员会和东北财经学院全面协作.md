Theory and Practice Twisted into One Rope
Shenyang Municipal People's Committee and Northeast University of Finance and Economics Engage in Comprehensive Collaboration

(Our newspaper Shenyang, April 19th) The Northeast University of Finance and Economics and the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee are comprehensively collaborating, twisting into one rope to solve the problem of integrating theory with practice. The Northeast University of Finance and Economics has become the "General Research Office" for financial and economic issues of the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee, and the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee has become the melting pot for the Northeast University of Finance and Economics to improve teaching quality and cultivate new types of university students who integrate theory with practice.

In order to lead the realization of this kind of socialist grand collaboration, both sides have agreed to send representatives to each other. The Shenyang Municipal People's Committee will send representatives to serve concurrently as members of the university affairs committee or scientific research committee of the Northeast University of Finance and Economics, and the Northeast University of Finance and Economics will send representatives to serve concurrently as deputy directors of the planning committee of the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee.

On the 10th, the responsible persons of both sides "linked up". The Northeast University of Finance and Economics introduced to the other party the close relationship between the five departments of the university—the Department of Industrial Economics, the Department of Trade Economics, the Department of Finance and Credit, the Department of Agricultural Economics, and the Department of Statistics—and the actual work departments of the Municipal People's Committee, and put forward the content of the request for assistance: (1) Please invite the responsible persons of the Municipal People's Committee and the business departments to serve as members of the university affairs committee, department affairs committee, and scientific committee, and also invite them to work as part-time teachers or give special lectures; (2) Please ask the Municipal People's Committee to assist in solving the policy of integrating theory with practice in teaching and scientific research, such as participating in investigations and research organized by the Municipal People's Committee, fixing connections with factories, mines, enterprises, and practical work departments, participating in planning and summary meetings, obtaining materials and documents, etc.; (3) It is hoped that the Municipal People's Committee will accept teachers with conditions to serve concurrently as members, researchers, deputy section chiefs, deputy division chiefs, secretaries, etc.; (4) Hope to solve the collaborative problems of students' labor production combined with their major; (5) Hope to solve the learning time and location problems of correspondence and night school students; (6) Request to supply major economic problems, improvement measures, and leap forward plans proposed by the big-character posters in the double-anti movement, so as to combine teaching with actual politics and improve teaching quality.

The representatives of the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee believed that the relationship between the departments of the Northeast University of Finance and Economics and the planning committee, economic committee, and various bureaus of the Municipal People's Committee was very important, and hoped that the two sides would work together to do a good job in Shenyang's financial and economic work. At present, the actual work departments of the Municipal People's Committee are mostly busy solving daily work, lacking comprehensive and systematic investigation and research on actual work, and lacking theoretical analysis. In the future, the Municipal People's Committee will present the problems existing in the actual work departments to the University of Finance and Economics as scientific research topics. For example, industrial planning, factory management, price investigation, commodity circulation, raw materials, production, distribution, transportation, grain and vegetable supply, etc., can be researched and solved in collaboration with the University of Finance and Economics. In addition, the representatives of the Municipal People's Committee also proposed to train financial and economic cadres on their behalf and invite teachers to give special financial and economic reports to the Municipal People's Committee.

In the past, the Northeast University of Finance and Economics had extensive cooperative relations with society. In the past two years, it has established communication links with 850 factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools across the country, exchanging materials, lecturing to each other, and conducting scientific research and social surveys. At present, the great leap forward in industry and agriculture has raised many major issues for economic work, and at the same time, the leap forward in education has also raised the issue of how to serve the great leap forward in production. The comprehensive collaboration between the two sides will help solve these problems. (Lai Denong)

    理论和实际扭成一根绳
    沈阳市人民委员会和东北财经学院全面协作
    本报沈阳19日电　东北财经学院和沈阳市人民委员会全面大协作，扭成一根绳，解决理论联系实际问题。东北财经学院成为沈阳市人民委员会财经问题的“总研究室”，沈阳市人民委员会成为东北财经学院提高教学质量、培养理论联系实际新型大学生的熔炉。
    为了领导实现这种社会主义大协作，双方已经商定互派代表，沈阳市人民委员会派代表兼任东北财经学院院务委员会或科学研究委员会委员，东北财经学院派代表兼任沈阳市人民委员会计委副主任。
    10日，双方负责人进行了“挂钩”。东北财经学院向对方介绍了全院五个系——工业经济系、贸易经济系、财政信贷系、农业经济系、统计系对市人委各实际工作部门的密切关系，并提出了要求帮助的内容：（一）请市人委和业务部门负责人担任院务委员会、系务委员会和科学委员会委员，并请作兼职教师或开专题讲座；（二）请市人委协助解决教学和科学研究上贯彻理论与实际相结合的方针，如参加市人委组织的调查研究，固定与厂矿、企业、实际工作部门的联系，参与计划、总结会议，取得资料、文件等等；（三）希望市人委接受有条件的教师兼任委员、研究员、副处长、副科长、秘书等职；（四）希望解决学生劳动生产与专业相结合的协作问题；（五）希望解决函授、夜校学生的学习时间和地点问题；（六）要求供给双反大字报提出的重大经济问题、改进措施、跃进规划等，以便使教学和实际政治相结合，提高教学质量。
    沈阳市人民委员会代表认为东北财经学院各系对市人委的计委、经委以及各局的关系很大，希望双方协作把沈阳市的财经工作做好。目前市人委各实际工作部门多忙于解决日常工作，对实际工作缺乏全面系统的调查研究，并缺乏理论上的分析。今后市人委要把各实际工作部门中存在的问题提出给财经学院作科学研究题目。如工业计划、工厂管理、物价调查、商品流通、原料、生产、分配、运输、粮食和蔬菜供应等等都可与财经学院协作研究和解决。另外，市人委代表还提出代培养财经干部，请教师到市人委作财经专题报告。
    东北财经学院过去曾和社会上有广泛的合作关系。近两年来已和全国八百五十个厂矿、企业、机关、学校建立了通讯联系、交换资料、互相讲学以及进行科学研究、社会调查等合作关系。当前由于工农业大跃进为经济工作提出许多重大问题，同时教育事业的跃进也提出了如何为生产大跃进服务的问题。双方进行全面大协作将有助于这些问题的解决。　（赖德浓）
