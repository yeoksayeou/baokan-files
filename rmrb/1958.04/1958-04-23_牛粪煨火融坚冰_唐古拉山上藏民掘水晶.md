Xinhua News Agency, Da Qaidam, April 22nd: Tibetan herdsmen in the Tanggula Mountain area have discovered crystal mines in several large caves. In the past month, the Tanggula Mountain Crystal Production Team has already mined 12,000 jin of crystals here.

After the Tibetan herdsmen discovered this extremely valuable mineral resource, the local Party committee immediately organized them to begin mining. Although this is a high mountain area more than 2,000 meters above sea level, with perennial snow cover, the Tibetan herdsmen have not shown the slightest fear and have overcome all kinds of difficulties encountered in the mining process one by one.

The Tibetan herdsmen cherish the motherland's treasures very much and are unwilling to randomly hammer and dig. They creatively use cow dung to heat the crystal caves, melting the solid ice before digging. The crystals dug out in this way are mostly complete hexagonal stalks, dazzling in their brilliance. This method of heating and digging for crystals not only improves the efficiency of crystal production, but also does not damage the ore body.

    牛粪煨火融坚冰
    唐古拉山上藏民掘水晶
    新华社大柴旦22日电　唐古拉山区藏民在几个大山洞里发现了水晶矿。唐古拉山水晶生产队最近一个月中已经在这里采掘出一万二千斤水晶。
    藏民们发现了这个十分珍贵的矿产以后，当地党委立即组织他们进行开采。虽然这里是拔海两千公尺以上的高山，常年积雪，但是藏民们没有丝毫的畏惧，采掘中所碰到的各种困难都一一克服了。
    藏民们对祖国的宝藏非常珍惜，不愿乱捶乱掘。他们创造性地在水晶洞里用牛粪煨火加热，使坚冰融解后再掘。这样掘出来的水晶绝大多数都是六棱完好的整株，光采夺目。这种加热掘晶的方法不仅提高了水晶生产效率，而且不损坏矿体。
