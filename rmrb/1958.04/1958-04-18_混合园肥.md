    "Mixed Garden Fertilizer"
    Raobu Agricultural Cooperative in Boyang County, Jiangxi Province, has created a "mixed garden fertilizer" (i.e., granular fertilizer) made without chemical fertilizers. After testing by the Shangrao Special District Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Office, 318 jin of this fertilizer is as effective as 100 jin of rapeseed cake. This fertilizer is easy to make and convenient to use. At the same time, the cost is low, only 8 jiao per 100 jin (including labor).
    "Mixed garden fertilizer" is made by reasonably mixing 20% garbage, 10% pond mud, 30% sod, 10% human manure and urine, 10% wood ash, 3% chicken manure, and 17% pig, cattle, and wild manure after composting. It is best used as top dressing for rice.

    “混合园肥”
    江西省波阳县饶埠农业社，创造了一种不用化学肥料制成的“混合园肥”（即颗粒肥料）。经过上饶专区农、林、水办公室化验，三百一十八斤可抵上一百斤菜籽饼的肥效。这种肥，容易制成，使用也方便。同时成本低，每百斤只要八角钱（包人工在内）。
    “混合园肥”是用垃圾20％、塘泥10％、草皮30％、人粪尿10％、草木灰10％、鸡粪3％、猪牛野粪17％经过堆积后，合理搭配制成的。用它作水稻追肥最好。
