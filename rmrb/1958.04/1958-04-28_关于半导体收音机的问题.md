    About the Semiconductor Radio

    Since the news of our country's successful development of semiconductor radios was published in the newspaper, it has attracted the attention of many readers, who have written to inquire about the characteristics and effects of semiconductor radios. Now, we provide a brief introduction based on materials provided by the Radio Technology Research Institute of the Shanghai Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Industry Company:

    The semiconductor transistors used in semiconductor radios are made of semiconductor germanium or silicon. They have no filament, do not require vacuum, and have a long service life (theoretically unlimited, but practically can be used normally for more than 5,000 hours), and can withstand severe vibration. Most valuable is its small size. A transistor is only the size of a watermelon seed. Its power consumption is also small. Three ordinary flashlight batteries can be used for more than 500 hours.

    The semiconductor radio successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Telecommunications and Electrical Appliance Industry Company on March 10 is large, but it weighs only two kilograms. It has four major features: light, small, no AC power required, and no need for antenna or ground wire, making it easy to listen anytime, anywhere. Therefore, it is very suitable for use in mountainous areas, rural areas, and on vehicles. According to preliminary tests, the reception distance and volume are slightly inferior to ordinary five-tube radios. It only has longwave and no shortwave. The preliminary estimated price per unit is about 150 yuan.

    Because the production of semiconductor radios still needs to be improved in quality, mass production and supply are not yet possible.

    关于半导体收音机的问题
    自从报上发表我国制成半导体收音机的消息后，引起广大读者的注意，纷纷来信询问半导体收音机的特点和效果。现在我们根据上海市电讯电器工业公司无线电技术研究所提供的材料简介如下：
    半导体收音机使用的半导体晶体管是用半导体锗或硅做成的。它没有灯丝，不需抽真空，使用寿命很长（理论上是无限期，实际正常使用可达五千小时以上），经得起剧烈震动。最可贵的是体积小，一只晶体管只有西瓜子那样大小。它的耗电量也小，三节普通手电筒用的干电池，就可用五百小时以上。
    上海市电讯电器工业公司在3月10日试制成功的半导体收音机虽然是大型的，但是重量不过二公斤。它有四大特点：轻、小，不用交流电，不用天、地线，随时随地可收听。因此非常适于山区、农村以及舟车中使用。根据初步试验，收听距离和音量稍差于普通五灯收音机，只有长波没有短波。每台价格初步估计约一百五十元。
    因为生产半导体收音机还需要继续改进提高质量，所以暂时还不能大量生产供应。
