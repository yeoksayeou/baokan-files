　　Everyone agrees that no matter what kind of work you do, you should have a global perspective. But when it comes to doing the work, it is often not the case. In the past, some commercial workers had the problem of being simply trapped in the business circle of "purchasing, sales, transfer, storage, and profit." Some people thought that it was "a dog biting a mouse, meddling in other people's business" for those who do business to manage production. They did not realize that the basis of exchange is production, and without production, commercial work cannot be done well.

　　The commercial staff in Heilongjiang are not like this. They learned some simple production knowledge and technology, and while promoting and purchasing goods, they took technology and goods to the countryside to help the masses solve production problems. As a result, they not only promoted production, but also promoted goods and increased the source of goods for commercial departments.

　　From this, it can be seen that no matter what kind of work, it is not good to only sweep the snow in front of your own door. Once you jump out of the small circle and look at problems from a global perspective, you will not only promote others, but also promote yourself.

### 跳出业务圈子

    跳出业务圈子
    不论做什么工作，都要有全局观点。这个道理谁也不否认。但是做起工作来，却往往不是这样。过去，有些商业工作者，就有单纯陷在“购、销、调、存、赚”的业务圈子里的毛病。有些人认为做买卖的管生产，是“狗咬耗子、多管闲事”。他们没有认识到交换的基础是生产，离开了生产，商业工作就做不好。
    黑龙江的商业工作人员则不是这样，他们学会了一些简单的生产知识和技术，在推销和收购商品的同时，带着技术和商品一同下乡，帮助群众解决生产上的困难，结果既促进了生产，也推销了商品和增加了商业部门的货源。
    由此可见，不管什么工作，各人自扫门前雪，是做不好的。而一旦跳出了小圈子，从全局看问题，就不仅促进了别人，也促进了自己。
