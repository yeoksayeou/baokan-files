    For One Second!
    To seize one second of time and extinguish raging fires as quickly as possible, Jian Hanzhang, a firefighter from the Guangzhou West District Fire Brigade, created the "Double Automatic Slip-Off Ladder Method." Using this method, it only takes six seconds to detach the three-section fire ladder from the top of the fire truck, improving work efficiency by four times compared to the past. Chen Tiehua and others improved the method of wearing bulky fire suits. In the past, they would put on the fire suit and then buckle the safety belt; now, they imitated the way women wear "Lenin suits" by fixing the safety belt to the fire suit, shortening the time.
    After technical appraisal and improvement of these operational methods, the fire brigade's preparation time for dispatch upon receiving an alarm was reduced from the original seventeen seconds to seven seconds! Tang Wen

    为了一秒钟！
    争取一秒钟的时间，尽快扑灭烈火，广州市西区消防队消防警简汉章，创造了“双重自动滑脱落梯法”。用这个方法，解消防车顶上的消防三节梯只需六秒钟，比过去的工作效率提高了四倍。陈铁华等改进了穿着笨重防火衣的方法。过去，他们是穿好防火衣后，再扣安全带；现在，他们模仿妇女穿“列宁装”的办法，把安全带固定连在防火衣上，缩短了时间。
    经过技术鉴定，改进了这几种操作方法后，使消防队在发现报警时，出队的准备时间由原来的十七秒钟减到七秒！　唐文
