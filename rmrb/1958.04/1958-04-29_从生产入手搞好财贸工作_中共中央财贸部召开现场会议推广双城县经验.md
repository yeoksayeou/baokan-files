Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 28th: The Financial and Trade Work Department of the CPC Central Committee convened an on-site financial and trade work meeting in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang, from April 21st to 24th, focusing on how financial and trade work should keep up with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Representatives from the financial and trade work departments of the provincial committees of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and the financial and trade work department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee attended the meeting.

What should financial and trade work do in the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production? Weihe Town in Shangzhi County, Heilongjiang Province, has created good experience in this regard, and Shuangcheng County has further developed this experience. In summary, their experience is that financial and trade work should start with production and serve production, in order to improve financial and trade work and promote production; in financial and trade work, it is necessary to establish political, production, and mass perspectives.

In the autumn of 1956, the Shuangcheng County Party Committee implemented the spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress, incorporating financial and trade work and industrial and agricultural production into the county, township, and cooperative work plans, with unified deployment and unified inspection, which greatly improved financial and trade work. However, financial and trade work still remained in a situation where it only carried out the work requested by industrial and agricultural production, and could not fully adapt to the current situation of rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. In February of this year, three cadres from the Financial and Trade Department of the Shuangcheng County Party Committee, together with the Secretary of the Township Party Committee, conducted two "experimental fields" for production and financial and trade work in the local supply and marketing cooperative and agricultural cooperative. When the four cadres were digging and carrying manure with the members of the agricultural cooperative, they found that carrying and delivering manure would soon form a high tide, and the supply and marketing cooperative must quickly organize a large number of carrying poles and soil baskets to supply the peasants. They instructed the Lanleng Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative to purchase goods overnight, and sold 500 soil baskets within seven days, while the original supply and marketing cooperative only planned to supply 60. Later, when the agricultural cooperative wanted to launch a surprise campaign to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene, they instructed the supply and marketing cooperative in advance to prepare rat poison and ammunition for shooting sparrows. In the two "experimental fields" of production and business, the four cadres saw that the thinking of the supply and marketing cadres lagged far behind the production situation. Therefore, they further organized the township's financial and trade cadres to launch a debate, organized them to visit and learn from the enthusiasm of the peasants, break conservative thinking, improve business from the perspective of promoting production, and adopt the methods of delivering goods to the door and purchasing on the spot to adapt to the new situation where peasants did not have time to come to the cooperative during the busy period of agricultural production. Because of participating in production, they also discovered that there were many ways for local agricultural and sideline production. The supply and marketing cooperative then promoted the development of sideline production in the agricultural cooperative through contracts and advance purchases, and formulated the supply and marketing cooperative's leap forward plan for purchasing and selling this year and the next five years, and took concrete measures to help the agricultural cooperative overcome the difficulties in developing sideline production, striving to increase the average sideline income per person in the township from 3.6 yuan last year to 76 yuan this year, not including the income from raising pigs.

At this time, the Shuangcheng County Bureau of Commerce, Bureau of Services, and Supply and Marketing Cooperative merged, combining enterprises and administration. The nine specialized companies were all changed to specialized stores, and a large number of personnel were sent to the countryside. They participated in agricultural production while doing the work of their own departments and maintaining contact with their own departments. For example, the cadres sent down from the supply and marketing cooperative system, in addition to participating in agricultural production, were also responsible for investigating the potential of agricultural cooperative's sideline production, helping agricultural cooperatives formulate sideline production plans, and promoting sideline production knowledge. The personnel sent down from the service system not only participated in agricultural production, but also raised livestock and poultry, summarized the experience of using substitute feed and preventing hog cholera, and helped farmers raise pigs and poultry. The cadres sent down from the commercial system also had to grasp the changing trends of rural purchasing power, and so on. These cadres sent down, combined with the "experimental fields" of various units, enabled financial and trade work to better promote production and serve production.

    从生产入手搞好财贸工作
    中共中央财贸部召开现场会议推广双城县经验
    据新华社哈尔滨28日电　中共中央财政贸易工作部从4月21日到24日在黑龙江双城县召开了财政贸易工作现场会议，着重研究了财贸工作怎样跟上工农业生产大跃进形势的问题。参加会议的有山西、河北、山东、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江六省省委财政贸易工作部和内蒙古自治区党委财政贸易工作部的代表。
    在工农业生产大跃进中财贸工作应该怎样做，黑龙江省尚志县苇河镇在这方面创造了较好的经验，双城县又进一步发展了这个经验。概括地说来，他们的经验就是，财贸工作要从生产入手，为生产服务，这样来搞好财贸工作，促进生产；在财贸工作中要树立政治观点、生产观点和群众观点。
    1956年秋季，双城县委贯彻党的“八大”精神，把财贸工作和工农业生产一起纳入县、乡、社工作规划之中，统一布置，统一检查，使财贸工作有了很大改进。但是，财贸工作还是停留在工农业生产提出什么要求就进行什么工作的局面，不能完全适应目前工农业生产飞跃发展的形势。今年2月间，双城县委财贸部三个干部在兰棱乡，同乡党委书记一起，在当地供销社和农业社搞了生产和财贸工作两块“试验田”。四个干部在农业社同社员一起挖粪、挑粪时，发现挑粪、送粪很快就要形成高潮，供销社必须赶快组织大批扁担和土篮子供应农民，他们就指示兰棱乡供销社连夜进货，七天内卖了五百副土篮子，而原来供销社只准备供应六十副。以后农业社要开展除四害讲卫生的突击运动，他们又事先指示供销社准备杀鼠药和打麻雀的枪沙弹药。四个干部在生产、业务两种“试验田”中，看出供销干部的思想落后于生产形势很远。于是他们进而组织乡的财贸干部展开鸣放辩论，组织他们参观学习农民的干劲，打破保守思想，从促进生产出发，改进业务，采取送货上门、就地收购的办法，适应农业生产紧张时期农民没有时间到合作社来的新情况。由于参加生产，又发现了当地农副业生产的门路很多，供销社于是又通过订合同、预购的办法，促进农业社发展副业生产，并且订出了供销社今年和今后五年的购销跃进规划，采取具体措施帮助农业社克服发展副业中的困难，争取使今年全乡平均每人副业收入由去年的三元六角跃进到七十六元，还不包括养猪的收入在内。
    在这个时候，双城县的商业局、服务局、供销社合并，企业和行政合一，九个专业公司都改为专业商店，大批人员下放农村。他们一面参加农业生产锻炼，一面做本部门的工作，同本部门保持联系。例如供销社系统下放的干部，除了参加农业生产以外，还负责调查农业社副业生产潜力，帮助农业社订副业生产规划，推广副业生产知识。服务系统下放的人员，不但参加农业生产，还饲养牲畜家禽，总结利用代用饲料和防治猪瘟的经验，帮助农民养猪、养家禽。商业系统下放干部还要掌握农村购买力变化的趋势等等。这些下放干部再同各单位的“试验田”结合在一起，就使财贸工作能够更好地促进生产，为生产服务。
