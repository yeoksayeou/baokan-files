Xinhua News Agency report: The capital's cultural circles are actively preparing to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the start of theatrical activities of Guan Hanqing, a world cultural figure and a great Chinese playwright. The commemorative meeting will be held at the end of June.

Guan Hanqing was a 13th-century Chinese realist people's playwright. The World Peace Council has decided to include him as one of the world cultural figures to be commemorated in 1958. Guan's plays number more than sixty, of which eighteen have survived. Most of his works depict the resistance of the oppressed working people against the feudal ruling class.

Starting in April, the capital's cultural circles will successively hold various activities to commemorate Guan Hanqing. Historians, playwrights, and writers in the capital will soon hold academic seminars on Guan Hanqing. The Drama Publishing House is publishing the complete works and selected works of Guan Hanqing. During the commemorative meeting, an exhibition introducing Guan Hanqing will be held in the Forbidden City. Twelve theaters and troupes will successively stage Guan's plays such as "Single Sword Meeting," "Wangjiang Pavilion," and "Dou E's Injustice." Playwright Tian Han recently created a drama, "Guan Hanqing," specifically to commemorate Guan Hanqing.

    纪念世界文化名人关汉卿
    据新华社讯　首都文化界正积极筹备纪念世界文化名人、我国伟大戏剧家关汉卿开始戏剧活动的七百周年。纪念大会将在6月底举行。
    关汉卿是十三世纪我国现实主义人民戏剧家，世界和平理事会决定列为1958年纪念的世界文化名人之一。关氏的剧作有六十多部，留传下来的尚有十八部，他的大部分作品都是描写被压迫的劳动人民对封建统治阶级的反抗的。
    首都文化界从4月份起将陆续举行各种纪念关汉卿的活动。首都的历史学家、戏剧家、文学家们最近将举行关于关汉卿的学术讨论会。戏剧出版社正在出版关汉卿创作全集和选集，纪念大会期间还将在故宫举行介绍关汉卿的展览会。有十二个剧院、剧团将先后上演关氏的剧作“单刀会”、“望江亭”、“窦娥冤”等。剧作家田汉新近特为纪念关汉卿创作了话剧“关汉卿”。
