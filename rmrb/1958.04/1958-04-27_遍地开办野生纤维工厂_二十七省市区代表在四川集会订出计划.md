Xinhua News Agency, Santai, 26th – The National Wild Fiber Utilization Conference held in Santai County, Sichuan Province, called on industrial and commercial departments across the country to make a great leap forward in the utilization of wild fibers this year, to purchase more and produce more, in order to meet the people's needs for clothing.

Representatives from twenty-seven provinces, cities, and autonomous regions participating in the conference all formulated production leap forward plans and measures for utilizing wild fibers this year. They unanimously decided to break with convention and treat the utilization of wild fibers as an important measure to solve the clothing problem of China's 600 million people, using revolutionary spirit to fill this blank spot in China's textile history.

At the meeting, representatives from the Santai Man-made Cotton Fiber Factory and the Wutongqiao Chuan Kang Wool Textile Factory respectively introduced their experiences in strengthening political and ideological work and relying on the masses to utilize wild fibers. On the basis of enhanced ideological understanding, the representatives exchanged professional techniques such as harvesting, peeling, degumming, and spinning of wild fibers, and went to the factory to operate with the workers to make wild fibers into semi-finished products (man-made cotton).

The meeting pointed out that China has a large output and wide distribution of wild fibers. In order to fully utilize these resources, in addition to establishing a small number of large and medium-sized demonstration processing plants in some cities with suitable conditions, it is necessary to adopt the mass line method of running factories, implement the policy of focusing on small-scale, decentralized, and rural-based factories, so that the wild fiber industry can develop rapidly in a short period of time. Industrial, agricultural, commercial, and scientific and technological departments should strengthen collaboration and cooperation, and do a good job in resource exploration, acquisition, and trial production of new products.

    遍地开办野生纤维工厂
    二十七省市区代表在四川集会订出计划
    据新华社三台26日讯　在四川省三台县召开的全国野生纤维利用会议，号召全国工业和商业部门在今年来个利用野生纤维的大跃进，多多收购，多多生产，以满足人民的穿用需要。
    参加会议的二十七个省、市、自治区的代表，都在会上订出了今年利用野生纤维的生产跃进计划和措施。他们一致决定要突破陈规，把利用野生纤维作为解决我国六亿人口穿用问题的一项重要措施，以革命的气魄补上我国纺织史上的这块空白点。
    会议上，三台人造棉纤维厂和五通桥川康毛纺织厂的代表，分别介绍了他们加强政治思想工作和依靠群众利用野生纤维的经验。代表们在思想认识提高的基础上，交换了野生纤维的采割、剥皮、脱胶、纺织等专业技术，并且下工厂同工人们一起操作，把野生纤维制成半成品（人造棉）。
    会议指出，我国野生纤维产量大、分布广。为了充分利用这些资源，除了在一些有条件的城市办少量大、中型示范加工工厂以外，必须用走群众路线的办厂方法，贯彻以小型为主，分散为主，农村为主的办厂方针，使野生纤维工业在短时期内迅速发展起来。工业、农业、商业和科学技术部门，要加强协作配合，作好资源勘察、收购、新产品试制等工作。（附图片）
