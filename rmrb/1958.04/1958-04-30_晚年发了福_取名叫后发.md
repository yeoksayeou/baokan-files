    Prospered in Old Age, Named Herself Houfa
  　Yuan Houfa
    I am already fifty-six years old. People call me Auntie Yuan. Recently, I gave myself a name, "Yuan Houfa."
    In the old society, I experienced countless hardships. My mother, younger brother, younger sister, two children, and my former husband all starved to death in the old society. I myself survived by begging. After liberation, my remarried husband became a porter, and we no longer went hungry. However, in the past year or two, because my husband is old, in poor health, and his income is not high, life has been somewhat difficult. When we can afford to eat, we can't afford to clothe ourselves, and the children can't go to school. In July 1957, the neighborhood committee introduced me to the social welfare production paper-picking group. I was very happy and worked actively, earning ten yuan a month. Now, my husband and I have a combined monthly income of nearly thirty yuan. We not only eat white flour and rice, made new clothes and new quilts, but also saved some money in the bank, and both children have gone to school. Thinking about the past and comparing it to the present, I can't help but tell everyone I meet that I used to "live in tears" and now I "live in song." That's why I gave myself the name "Houfa," meaning that I myself am "prospering in my old age," and our country has a "boundless future."

    晚年发了福　取名叫后发
  　袁后发
    我已经五十六岁了，人家叫我袁大娘，最近我给自己取了个名字，叫“袁后发”。
    我在旧社会经历了无数的苦难，我的母亲、弟弟、妹妹、两个孩子和我过去的丈夫都是在旧社会饿死的，我自己当时也是靠讨饭过日子。解放以后，我重新结婚的丈夫当上了搬运工人，才不再挨饿了。但是，近一、二年来，因为丈夫年岁大了，身体又不好，收入不多，生活还有些困难，顾上吃，就顾不上穿，孩子也不能上学。1957年7月居民委员会介绍我参加了社会福利生产拣纸小组，我很高兴，就积极劳动，一个月可有十元的收入。现在，我和我丈夫每月的收入近三十元。不仅吃上了白面、大米，做了新衣、新被，还在银行里存了一点钱，两个孩子也进了学校。想想过去，比比现在，我不能不逢人便说，我过去是“哭着过”，现在是“唱着过”。所以我才给自己取了“后发”这个名字，我的意思想表示我自己是“晚年发福”，我们的国家是“前程无量”。
