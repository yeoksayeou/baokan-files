Henan Sesame

　　Henan Province is one of the important sesame producing areas in China, with a cultivation area of 5.09 million mu, ranking first in the country. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual output was about 2.4 million dan, also ranking first in the country. The oil content of sesame is higher than that of soybeans, peanuts, and coconuts. Every 100 jin can yield 50 jin of oil, and up to 56 jin in some cases.

　　There are no fewer than a hundred varieties of sesame in Henan.

　　Each year, 30%—40% of Henan's sesame oil production is shipped to large cities such as Beijing and Tianjin, and a portion is sold abroad. Sesame is also one of Henan's honey sources. When the southern honey sources are scarce in summer, Henan sesame flowers are in full bloom. Sesame honey is orange-yellow and transparent.

    河南芝麻
    河南省为我国芝麻重要产区之一，栽培面积五百零九万亩，占全国第一位。第一个五年计划期间，每年产量平均二百四十万担左右，也占全国第一位。芝麻的含油率比大豆、花生、椰子都高，每百斤可榨油五十斤，高者可达五十六斤。
    河南的芝麻品种不下百余种。
    河南的芝麻油每年有占总产量的30％—40％运销北京、天津等大城市，有一部分行销国外。芝麻也是河南蜜源之一。夏季南方蜜源缺乏时，河南芝麻花正在盛开。芝麻蜜是橙黄色，透明。
