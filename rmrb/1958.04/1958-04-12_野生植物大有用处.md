Editorial: Wild Plants Are of Great Use

Extensive collection and full utilization of wild plant resources is a new way to solve the shortage of certain light industrial raw materials in our country, and it is worthy of our attention. Our country has a vast territory and extremely rich wild plant resources. After several years of testing, it has been proven that the seeds, bark, roots, and grasses of wild plants are all useful and valuable. Their seeds contain fat if they don't contain starch; if they can't be used to make wine, they can be used to extract oil, and some seeds and leaves can also be used to extract precious perfumes and fragrances; their bark, roots, vines, and grasses all contain fiber, and some varieties also contain tannin. Fibers that are short and weak in tensile strength can be used for papermaking, while fibers that are long and strong in tensile strength can be used to make artificial cotton and for batting and spinning; tannin can be used to make tanning extracts. According to preliminary statistics, after testing, trial production, and identification, there are already more than 1,000 kinds of wild plants that can be used as raw materials for oil, starch, fiber, tanning extracts, etc., and the output is very large, truly inexhaustible. If these resources are fully utilized, it will be of great benefit to our country's socialist construction and people's lives.

As everyone knows, the current growth in the production of vegetable oils, brewing materials, and cotton in our country cannot fully meet the needs of the textile, oil extraction, and winemaking industries. Now, we have opened up a new path, which is to use wild plants to partially replace cotton for spinning and weaving, and partially replace grain and oil for winemaking and oil extraction. According to preliminary estimates, in the next three years, except for a few famous wines, wild starch can completely replace grain for winemaking, and wild oil can completely replace industrial oil, while also increasing the amount of edible oil for the people. Sichuan Province has made a plan based on the province's wild fiber resources that by 1960, the processing of wild fiber will produce 2.5 million dan of artificial cotton. This figure is equivalent to the cotton production of 8 million mu of cotton fields, equal to 1.6 times the cotton production of the entire Sichuan Province in the bumper year of 1957. This year, the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative system plans to purchase 100,000 dan of wild oil, which can increase the per capita oil consumption in the province by 2.3 liang; purchasing 600,000 dan of wild starch can save more than 70 million jin of grain.

Extensive collection and full utilization of wild plants can increase farmers' income and save state investment. The results of a general survey of wild plants in Badong County, Hubei Province last year showed that if all the usable wild plants in the county were collected, without any processing, the increased income of farmers could be used to expand agricultural production investment, purchasing 2,561 tons of chemical fertilizers or 10,564 double-wheeled double-share plows. If processed, they could buy more than 11,000 tons of chemical fertilizers or more than 45,000 double-wheeled double-share plows. Obviously, if all kinds of wild plants are collected and utilized, it will greatly increase the wealth of the country and the income of farmers, supporting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

Regarding the issue of utilizing wild plants, although various places have begun to pay attention to it in the past two years, it has not yet been fully promoted, and there is still a lack of specific measures. The utilization of wild plants should involve multi-faceted collection, bold experimentation, focusing on small-scale operations, on-site processing, grasping typical examples, holding on-site meetings, exchanging experiences, actively promoting, and universally utilizing. There are several issues that deserve attention here. One issue is the implementation of the production line and mass line in procurement work. Wild plants have many varieties, a wide range of areas, and great potential, so we should first conduct a survey of local resources, find out the details, help agricultural cooperatives make plans for sideline production, organize mass production, and formulate specific indicators on schedule to ensure realization. Wild plant resources are scattered, and the seasonal nature of maturity is very strong, and the collection work is an arduous task. Therefore, we must rely on the local Party committees and governments to vigorously mobilize and organize the masses, and entrust this task to the local agricultural cooperatives to ensure timely collection and concentration of scattered things. At the same time, we must also let the broad masses of peasants master the technology of collecting wild plants, educate the masses to understand the principle of combining collection and cultivation, and pay attention to protecting resources during collection so that they can continue to grow and reproduce. For some important varieties, artificial cultivation can also be promoted to expand reproduction.

Another issue is the processing of wild plants. Because the characteristics of wild plants are that they have many varieties, are scattered and disorganized, and have a strong growing season, the processing policy should be: take materials locally, process locally, suitable for decentralization, not suitable for centralization, make do with what is available, both good and economical. Wild plant processing plants should go up the mountains and down to the countryside, as a component of developing local industries, and included in the local industrial development plan. Another issue is to strengthen cooperation in all aspects. The key to expanding the utilization of wild plants is testing, trial production, identification, and giving full play to multiple uses. This requires industrial departments, agricultural departments, forestry departments, scientific research departments, health departments, and commercial departments to cooperate. Only a small part of the wild plants have been utilized, and even this part requires us to continue to conduct multi-faceted experiments and research to discover more uses. For example, the pagoda tree beans grown on pagoda trees in the north used to be used only as feed. After trial production by relevant departments in Tianjin, it was found that they can be used to extract rutin, a medicine for treating high blood pressure, as well as pagoda yellow and maltose, and other industrial raw materials, while its by-products can still be used as feed. This greatly increases the use value and expands sales. Therefore, bold technical attempts are of great significance for expanding the utilization of wild plant resources. Of course, doing so will encounter many difficulties, but the successful experience of trial production, research, and utilization of wild plants in the past few years proves that as long as we strengthen cooperation, as long as we have determination and dare to overcome difficulties, we will definitely be able to achieve success. The broad masses of personnel in relevant departments should go all out and make every effort to promote the development of this new cause.

The most important issue now is that Party committees at all levels must strengthen leadership, which is the basic guarantee for promoting the smooth development of this new cause. Because collecting and utilizing wild plants is not only an economic work, but more importantly, a mass work and a political work; it is not only the work of commercial departments, but also requires the strong support and cooperation of agricultural departments, industrial departments, scientific research departments, and health departments. Therefore, we hope that Party committees at all levels will strengthen unified leadership and planning for this work, and quickly launch this promising new cause that can both promote the development of light industry and promote agricultural development.

    野生植物大有用处
    广泛地采集和充分利用野生植物资源，这是解决我国某些轻工业原料不足的一个新途径，很值得我们重视。我国幅员广大，野生植物资源极其丰富。经过几年来的试验证明：野生植物的籽、皮、根、草，样样可用，件件是宝。它们的籽实，不含淀粉就含脂肪，不能酿酒便能榨油，有的籽叶还可提炼高贵的香精香料；它们的皮、根、藤、草，都含有纤维，部分品种还含有单宁。纤维短、拉力弱的可供造纸，纤维长、拉力强的可制人造棉、弹絮纺纱；单宁可制烤胶。据目前初步的统计，经过化验、试制和鉴定，可作为油料、淀粉、纤维、烤胶等原料的野生植物，已有一千多种，而且产量很大，真是取之不尽，用之不竭。如果把这些资源充分地利用起来，对于我国社会主义建设和人民生活都将有很大好处。
    大家知道，目前我国植物油料、酿酒原料和棉花生产的增长，还不能充分满足纺织业和榨油、制酒工业的需要，现在，我们已经开辟了一条新的道路，这就是：利用野生植物，来部分地代替棉花纺纱织布，部分地代替粮食油料酿酒榨油。根据初步估算，在今后三年之内，除去几大名酒以外，利用野生淀粉可以全部代替粮食酿酒，利用野生油料可以全部代替工业用油，同时还可以增加人民的食油用量。四川省根据本省野生纤维的资源情况做出计划，到1960年用野生纤维加工，将生产人造棉二百五十万担。这个数字相当于八百万亩棉田的棉花产量，等于四川全省1957年棉花丰收的产量一点六倍。今年，四川省供销社系统计划采购野生油料十万担，可使全省每人用油量增加二两三钱；采购野生淀粉六十万担，可节省粮食七千多万斤。
    对野生植物的广泛采集和充分利用，可以增加农民的收入，节约国家的投资。湖北省巴东县去年对野生植物普查的结果表明，如果把全县可以利用的野生植物全部收集起来，不经任何加工，农民所增加的收入用于扩大农业的生产投资，可买化学肥料二千五百六十一吨，或买双轮双铧犁一万零五百六十四部。如果经过加工，还可以多买化学肥料一万一千多吨，或多买双轮双铧犁四万五千多部。显而易见，如果把各种野生植物都收集并利用起来，将会大大增加国家的财富和农民的收入，支援工农业生产的大跃进。
    关于利用野生植物的问题，近两年来，虽然各地已经开始重视了，但还未全面推广，还缺乏具体措施。对野生植物的利用，应该多方采集，大胆试验，以小型为主，就地加工，抓紧典型，召开现场会议，交流经验，积极推广，普遍利用。这里有几个问题值得注意。一个问题是贯彻执行采购工作中的生产路线和群众路线的问题。野生植物的品种多、地区广、潜力大，因此应该首先对当地资源进行勘察，摸清底细，帮助农业社作出副业生业规划，组织群众生产，按期制定具体指标，保证实现。野生植物资源分散、成熟的季节性很强，采集工作是一件繁重的任务。因此，必须依靠当地党委和政府，大力发动群众，组织群众，把这个任务交由当地农业社承担，才能及时采集，把零星分散的东西集中起来。同时还必须让广大农民群众掌握采集野生植物的技术，教育群众懂得采集和培育相结合的道理，在采集时注意保护资源，使它能够继续生长繁殖。对于某些重要品种，还可以提倡人工培育，扩大繁殖。
    另一个问题是野生植物的加工问题。由于野生植物的特点是品种繁多，分散零乱，生长季节性很强，所以加工方针应该是：就地取材，就地加工，宜于分散，不宜集中，因陋就简，既好又省。野生植物的加工厂应当上山下乡，作为发展地方工业的一个组成部分，列在地方工业发展规划以内。还有一个问题是加强各方面协作。扩大利用野生植物的关键，是化验、试制、鉴定和发挥多种用途。这就必须使工业部门、农业部门、林业部门、科学研究部门、卫生部门和商业部门共同协作。现在已被利用的野生植物，还只是很少的一部分，就是这一部分，也还需要我们继续作多方面的试验和研究，以发现更多的用途。比如，北方槐树上结的槐豆，过去仅用作饲料，经天津有关部门协作试制以后，发现可提制治疗高血压药剂的路丁和槐黄、饴糖等工业原料，而它的副产品仍然可作饲料。这就大大地提高了使用价值，扩大了销路。因此技术上的大胆尝试，对于扩大利用野生植物资源有很重要的意义。当然，这样做会遇到很多困难，但是，过去几年试制、研究和利用野生植物的成功经验证明：只要加强协作，只要有决心，勇于克服困难，就一定能够获得成功。有关部门的广大人员，都应该鼓足干劲，尽一切努力促进这个新事业的发展。
    现在最重要的问题是：各地党委要加强领导，这是促进这个新事业顺利发展的基本保证。因为采集和利用野生植物，不单是经济工作，而更重要的是群众工作和政治工作；不单是商业部门的工作，而且需要农业部门、工业部门、科学研究部门、卫生部门的大力支援和共同协作。所以，我们希望各地党委加强对这个工作的统一领导和筹划，把这个既能促进轻工业的发展、又能促进农业发展的大有可为的新事业迅速地举办起来。
