The Monument to the People's Heroes, standing tall in Tiananmen Square, has been completed. Recently, with immense reverence, I visited this majestic and solemn monument.

I walked towards Tiananmen Square from East Chang'an Street. As soon as I entered the square, I saw the monument standing like a giant between heaven and earth in the southern part of the square, facing Tiananmen from afar. From a distance, I could see the eight golden characters "人民英雄永垂不朽" (The People's Heroes Are Immortal), inscribed by Chairman Mao himself. To the north of the monument is the square, surrounded by green lawns, and to the south is a lush pine forest. I crossed the square, stepping on the newly laid orange-yellow granite path, and slowly walked to the steps of the monument to carefully admire it from close range.

Comrade Jia Guoqing, the person in charge of the monument construction site, introduced me to the construction process of the monument. He said that this monument was built according to the resolution of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on September 30, 1949. That evening, Chairman Mao led all the CPPCC members to hold a solemn foundation-laying ceremony for the monument. Chairman Mao himself wielded the shovel to break ground and lay the cornerstone for the monument. Since construction began on August 1, 1952, it has received enthusiastic support and care from the people of the whole country. This is the first and largest monument in China since ancient times. It is 37.94 meters high from the ground to the top of the monument, as tall as a ten-story building, and 4.24 meters higher than Tiananmen Gate across from the monument. The monument is made of 17,000 pieces of hard granite and pure white marble. It symbolizes the great achievements of the martyrs and marks the nation's commemoration of the martyrs.

I stepped onto the granite steps and arrived at the second-level platform. The body of the monument is surrounded by double-layered white marble railings. The shape of the railings is the same as the white marble railings of the Jade Belt Bridge in front of Tiananmen, which are beautiful, simple, and dazzlingly white, making the towering monument appear even more solemn and majestic. On the front (north side) of the monument, on a heart stone weighing 60 tons and 14.7 meters long, are carved the eight gilded characters "人民英雄永垂不朽" (The People's Heroes Are Immortal) inscribed by Chairman Mao, which are the theme of the monument and shine brightly in the sunlight. On the back of the monument, 150 gilded characters are neatly arranged, which is the inscription written by Premier Zhou himself. The main text of the inscription is:

	“The people's heroes who sacrificed in the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution in the past three years are immortal.

	The people's heroes who sacrificed in the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution in the past thirty years are immortal.

	Going back to 1840, the people's heroes who sacrificed in the struggles to oppose internal and external enemies and to strive for national independence and people's freedom and happiness since then are immortal."

On the upper part of the east and west sides of the monument, there are decorative patterns of "Eternal Glory" composed of red stars, pine and cypress trees, and flags, symbolizing that the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs will last forever and always illuminate future generations. On the upper and lower perimeters of the large and small monument bases are carved eight large wreaths composed of peony, lotus, chrysanthemum, and other flowers. These flowers symbolize the qualities of "nobility," "purity," and "perseverance," representing the nation's eternal remembrance and admiration of the heroes. The top of the monument is in the traditional national architectural style, with a small hip roof with swirling clouds above and heavy curtains below. After admiring the entire monument, people feel that it has both a national style and a clear spirit of the new era.

Ten large white marble reliefs are embedded around the base of the large monument. These days, sculptors and stonemasons are carefully making the final modifications. Sculptor Liu Kaiqu, who is in charge of leading the art design of the monument, is carefully checking the picture of each relief. I asked him to introduce the situation of the reliefs. He said that these large reliefs are two meters high and 40.68 meters long in total. According to geological verification, these reliefs can last for at least 800 to 1,000 years. There are about twenty heroic figures in each relief. Each figure is the same size as a real person, and their faces, personalities, thoughts, feelings, and postures are different.

Starting from the east side of the monument, admire them in historical order. The first relief is "Burning Opium," which recounts the story of the masses destroying opium in Humen on June 3, 1839, before the Opium War. On the relief, angry masses are transporting boxes of opium that poisoned the Chinese people to the seaside, dumping them into lime pits and burning them, and plumes of smoke are rising from the lime pits. Behind the crowd, there are forts and thousands of warships ready to retaliate against the provocations of British imperialism at any time. The images of the characters in the picture show the firm determination of the Chinese people to resist imperialism. The second relief on the east side depicts the "Jintian Uprising" of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in 1851. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was the prelude to the Chinese democratic revolution. It put forward the slogans of political, economic, national, and gender equality, which seriously shaken the foundation of the feudal rule of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. In this relief, a group of sons and daughters of Han and Zhuang ethnic groups, holding broadswords, spears, hoes, and earthen cannons, are surging down the hillside, and the revolutionary banner is flying in the wind.

Turning south to the back of the monument, you can see the solemn scene of the "Wuchang Uprising" of the 1911 Revolution (Xinhai Revolution). Late at night, the uprising New Army and citizens destroyed the cannons in front of the Huguang Governor's mansion and were rushing into the Governor's mansion. The raging flames inside the Governor's mansion rose into the sky; the sign of the Governor's mansion was broken in front of the steps; the torn dragon flag of the Qing Dynasty was trampled on the ground. The Xinhai Revolution ended the feudal monarchy that had lasted for more than two thousand years. The next one is the "May Fourth Patriotic Movement." This was the turning point of the Chinese democratic revolution from the old democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution. The picture of the relief shows the scene of students gathering in front of Tiananmen Square to hold a patriotic demonstration. A group of young men and women students holding a flag to abolish the traitorous secret treaty came to Tiananmen Square with great enthusiasm. At the height of the crowd, a male student was giving a speech to the masses surrounding him. A female student with her hair combed into a bun and wearing a long skirt was distributing leaflets to the citizens. The angry young speaker and the angry crowd made the entire relief full of hatred for national traitors and an exciting atmosphere. The third relief on the south side is the "May 30th Movement." On May 30, 1925, more than 10,000 people in Shanghai held an anti-imperialist demonstration on Nanjing Road. British patrolmen opened fire on unarmed people, killing and wounding many people. The "May 30th Massacre" aroused great indignation among the people of Shanghai and even the whole country, which promoted the outbreak of a great revolutionary storm across the country. This relief shows the scene of people from all walks of life led by the working class struggling unyieldingly against imperialism. In the picture, thousands of workers, students, and citizens held small flags of "Down with Imperialism" and bravely advanced through the sandbags and barbed wire of British patrolmen; shops closed down and went on strike, and businessmen wearing top hats also joined the ranks of the struggle; the wounded workers continued to move forward bravely with the help of their comrades. The Customs and Bank buildings on the Bund can be vaguely seen behind the crowd.

On the west side of the monument, the first relief is the "August 1st Nanchang Uprising." The picture shows the scene of this great uprising from the perspective of a company. On the morning of August 1, 1927, the company commander of a company waved his right hand and announced the uprising to the soldiers. The soldiers raised the signal of the uprising - the horse lamp, and the glorious red flag was raised. Warhorses were roaring, and the working people were helping to carry ammunition. The soldiers shouted with excitement. From this moment on, the Chinese people had their own armed forces and launched a struggle against counter-revolutionary armed forces with revolutionary armed forces. Immediately following is the "Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines." The relief shows the scene of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the Taihang Mountains during the Anti-Japanese War. Looking from a distance, in a magnificent and steep hillside, guerrillas are passing through tall trees and dense green gauze tents to fight the enemy. In the picture, young men and women farmers are carrying shovels and homemade landmines; a white-haired mother is sending guns to her son to fight the Japanese invaders; a young boy is standing next to the commander, waiting for orders, ready to join the battle to eliminate the enemy at any time.

We came to the front of the monument and saw the relief of the People's Liberation Army's million-strong army "Victory Crossing the Yangtze River and Liberating All of China" during the Liberation War, which is the largest of the ten reliefs. The Yangtze River, which the Kuomintang believed could not be crossed, was successfully crossed by the brave and invincible People's Liberation Army. On the relief, the bugler blew the charge; the commander raised his right hand high and fired signal flares into the air one after another. The soldiers who had landed on the enemy's shore stepped on the flags of the reactionaries and rushed towards Nanjing, the old nest of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Behind them, countless warships were advancing in the waves. On both sides of this relief are two decorative reliefs. On the left is the scene of workers carrying stretchers, farmers transporting military grain, and women sending military shoes to enthusiastically support the front line on the eve of the crossing of the river. The one on the right shows the scene of people from all walks of life holding red flags and flowers, holding fruits in both hands, welcoming and comforting the People's Liberation Army.

After watching all the reliefs, the people who accompanied me on the visit were busy preparing for the unveiling ceremony. I re-admired the characters "人民英雄永垂不朽" (The People's Heroes Are Immortal) and the inscription, and I walked around the base of the monument several times, carefully admiring the reliefs. In a few years, the Revolutionary Museum and the History Museum will be built on both sides of the Monument to the People's Heroes. This will become a place to admire the revolutionary martyrs. From here, people will be able to learn about the arduous road that the Chinese revolution has gone through, the glorious example of the martyrs, and the huge price that the Chinese people have paid to gain freedom and liberation. When I walked down the platform and left the monument, I once again silently paid tribute to the people's heroes who sacrificed in the past struggles.

    人民英雄永垂不朽
    瞻仰首都人民英雄纪念碑
    新华社记者　周定舫
    屹立在天安门广场上的人民英雄纪念碑落成了。近日，我怀着万分崇敬的心情，瞻仰了这座巍峨雄伟、庄严的纪念碑。
    我从东长安街向天安门广场走去，刚进入广场就望见纪念碑像顶天立地的巨人一样矗立在广场南部，和天安门遥遥相对，在远处就可以看到毛主席亲笔题写的“人民英雄永垂不朽”八个金色大字。碑的北面是广场，四周是绿色的草坪，南面是葱翠的松树林。我越过广场，踏着刚铺成的橘黄色花岗石石道，徐徐走到纪念碑台阶前，从近处来仔细瞻仰纪念碑。
    纪念碑工地负责人贾国卿，向我介绍了纪念碑的兴建经过。他说，这座纪念碑是根据1949年9月30日中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议的决议兴建的，当天傍晚，毛主席率领全体政协委员为纪念碑举行了庄严隆重的奠基礼，毛主席亲自执锨铲土，为纪念碑奠定基石。从1952年8月1日动工兴建以来，得到了全国人民的热情支援和关怀。这是中国自古以来，第一座最大的纪念碑。它从地面到碑顶高达三十七点九四公尺，有十层楼那么高，比纪念碑对面的天安门还高四点二四公尺。纪念碑是用一万七千块坚硬的花岗石和洁白的汉白玉砌成的。它象征着先烈们的丰功伟绩，标志着全国人民对先烈的怀念。
    我踏上花岗石铺成的台阶，到了第二层月台。碑身四周围绕着双层汉白玉栏杆，栏杆的形状和天安门前玉带桥的汉白玉栏杆一样，美观朴素、洁白耀眼，使挺拔的碑身显得更加庄严、雄伟。碑的正面（北面）在一块六十吨重、十四点七公尺长的碑心石上，雕刻着毛主席题写的“人民英雄永垂不朽”八个镏金大字，这八个字是碑的主题，在阳光照耀下闪闪发光。在碑身背面，一百五十个镏金字整齐地排列着，这是周总理亲笔写的碑文。碑文的正文是：
    “三年以来在人民解放战争和人民革命中牺牲的人民英雄们永垂不朽
    三十年以来在人民解放战争和人民革命中牺牲的人民英雄们永垂不朽
    由此上溯到一千八百四十年从那时起为了反对内外敌人争取民族独立和人民自由幸福在历次斗争中牺牲的人民英雄们永垂不朽”
    碑身东西两侧上部，刻着以红星、松柏和旗帜组成的“光辉永照”的装饰花纹，象征着先烈们的革命精神万年长存，永远照耀着后代。大、小碑座的上、下四周，雕刻着以牡丹花、荷花、菊花等组成的八个大花圈，这些花朵象征着品质“高贵”、“纯洁”和“坚忍”，表示全国人民对英雄们的永远怀念和敬仰。碑顶是民族传统的建筑形式，是上有卷云下有重幔的小庑殿顶。瞻仰整个碑型后，使人们感到既有民族风格，又有鲜明的新时代精神。
    十块汉白玉的大浮雕，镶嵌在大碑座的四周。这几天，雕刻家和石工们一起，在精心地作最后一遍修饰。负责领导纪念碑美术设计的雕刻家刘开渠，正在细心地检查每幅浮雕的画面。我请他介绍了有关浮雕方面的情况。他说，这些大浮雕高二公尺，合在一起共长四十点六八公尺。据地质学家化验证明，这些浮雕至少能耐久八百年到一千年。每幅浮雕里有二十个左右英雄人物，每个人物都和真人一样大小，他们的面貌、性格、思想、感情和姿态形象都不相同。
    从碑身东面起，按着历史顺序往下瞻仰。第一幅浮雕是“焚烧鸦片烟”，记述鸦片战争前夕，1839年6月3日，群众在虎门烧毁鸦片的事迹。浮雕上，愤怒的群众正在把一箱箱毒害中国人民的鸦片运到海边，倾倒在放有石灰的窑坑里焚烧，一股股浓烟从石灰池上升起。人群后面，有炮台和千百只待发的战船，准备随时还击英帝国主义的挑衅。画面上人物的形象，表现出中国人民反抗帝国主义的坚定决心。东面的第二幅浮雕，是描写1851年太平天国的“金田起义”。太平天国是中国民主主义革命的序幕，它提出政治、经济、民族、男女四大平等的口号，严重地动摇了满清皇朝封建统治的基础。在这幅浮雕上，一群拿着大刀、梭镖、锄头、土炮起义的汉、僮族人民的儿女，正风起云涌地从山坡冲下来，革命的旌旗在迎风飘扬。
    往南转到碑身的后面，看到的是1911年辛亥革命“武昌起义”的庄严画面。深夜，起义的新军和市民，摧毁了湖广总督门前的大炮，正向总督府里冲去。总督府内熊熊的火焰冒向天空；总督府的牌子，被打断在阶前；撕碎了的清朝的龙旗，被践踏在地下。辛亥革命，结束了二千多年来的封建帝制。接下来的一幅是“五四爱国运动”。这是中国民主革命由旧民主主义革命转变为新民主主义革命的转折点。浮雕的画面显示出学生们齐集于天安门前举行爱国示威游行的情景。一群男女青年学生举着废除卖国密约的旗帜，慷慨激昂地来到天安门前，人群高处，一个男学生正在向围着他的群众演说。梳着髻子、系着长裙的女学生，在向市民们散发传单。愤激的青年演说者，怒形于色的人群，使整个浮雕充满了痛恨国贼，激动人心的气氛。南面的第三幅是“五卅运动”。1925年5月30日，上海群众一万多人在南京路上举行反帝国主义大示威，英国巡捕向徒手群众开枪射击，死伤多人。“五卅惨案”引起了全上海以至全国人民的极大愤慨，促使全国范围的大革命风暴的爆发。这幅浮雕表现出由工人阶级领导的各界人民坚强不屈地向帝国主义斗争的情景。画面上成千上万的工人、学生、市民举着“打倒帝国主义”的小旗，冲破英国巡捕的沙袋、铁丝网英勇地前进；商店关门罢市，戴着礼帽的商人也加入了斗争的行列；被打伤的工人，在战友们搀扶下，继续勇往直前。人群后面隐约能看到外滩的海关和银行大楼。
    碑身的西面，第一幅是“八一南昌起义”的浮雕。画面从一个连队的角度来表现这一伟大起义的情景。1927年8月1日早晨，一个连队的连长，挥着右手向战士们宣布起义，士兵们举着起义的信号——马灯，光辉的红旗举起来了，战马在呼啸，劳动人民正在帮助搬运子弹，战士们激昂地高呼着。从这时起，中国人民有了自己的武装部队，展开了以革命的武装反对反革命的武装的斗争。紧接着的一幅是“抗日敌后游击战”，浮雕上显现出抗日战争时期太行山区敌后游击战的场面。远远望去，在一座雄伟峻峭的半山腰里，游击队员们正穿过高大的树林和茂密的青纱帐，去和敌人战斗。画面上，青年男女农民拿着铁铲背着土制地雷；白发的母亲送枪给儿子去打击日本侵略者；年青小伙子站在指挥员身旁，等候命令，准备随时投入消灭敌人的战斗。
    我们来到碑的正面，看到解放战争时期人民解放军百万雄师“胜利渡长江，解放全中国”的浮雕，这是十幅浮雕中最大的一幅。国民党认为不能逾越的天堑长江，被英勇无敌的人民解放军胜利地渡过了。浮雕上，号兵吹起冲锋号；指挥员右手高举，连连向高空发射信号弹，已登上敌岸的战士，踏着反动派的旗帜，向国民党反动统治的老巢——南京城冲去。背后，数不清的战船正在波涛中前进。在这幅浮雕的两旁，是两块装饰性的浮雕。左边是渡江前夕，工人抬着担架、农民运送军粮、妇女送军鞋等热烈支援前线的场面。右边的一块表现全国各阶层人民举着红旗和鲜花，双手捧着水果，欢迎解放军、慰劳解放军的情景。
    看完了所有的浮雕，陪我参观的人都忙着筹备揭幕典礼去了。我又重新瞻仰了“人民英雄永垂不朽”几个大字和碑文，我绕着碑座走了几圈，细细地瞻仰着浮雕。几年以后，在人民英雄纪念碑两旁，将要兴建革命博物馆和历史博物馆，这里将成为一个瞻仰革命先烈的地方。人们从这里将可以了解到中国革命所经过的艰苦道路，先烈们的光辉榜样，中国人民为了取得自由、解放，曾经付出的巨大代价。当我走下月台，离开纪念碑的时候，又一次向在历次斗争中牺牲的人民英雄们默默致敬。
