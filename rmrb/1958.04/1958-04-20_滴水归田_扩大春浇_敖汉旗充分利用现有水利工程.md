Every Drop to the Field, Expanding Spring Irrigation
Aohan Banner Fully Utilizes Existing Water Conservancy Projects

(Reported by this newspaper) Aohan Banner, Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is fully utilizing existing water conservancy projects to carry out large-scale spring irrigation, based on the principle of combining water management and water use.

The water conservancy projects completed in Aohan Banner last winter and this spring can expand the irrigated area by more than 230,000 mu. At present, the entire banner has utilized more than 1,200 water wells and all usable canals, as well as methods such as ice storage and snow water interception, to irrigate more than 70,000 mu of land. The two townships of Xipaozi and Changshengdianzi put forward the slogan "Not a single drop of water wasted," and started irrigating day and night from mid-March. By March 28, in half a month, they had rushed to irrigate more than 27,000 mu of land. Adding the 12,000 mu collected last autumn, the irrigated land has accounted for 80% of the total sown area of the two townships. They proposed to irrigate all the cultivated land once before spring plowing.

At present, more than 80% of the water wells in the banner have been equipped with water lifting tools. Since December of last year, the supply and marketing cooperatives have supplied more than 900 waterwheels, and various localities have relied on the masses to create many self-made water lifting tools. Some of these new tools have been promoted after testing.

    滴水归田　扩大春浇
    敖汉旗充分利用现有水利工程
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟敖汉旗根据治水用水相结合的方针，充分利用现有水利工程大量进行春浇。
    敖汉旗去冬今春完成的水利工程可扩大灌溉面积二十三万多亩。目前全旗已经利用起一千二百多眼水井和所有能利用的水渠，以及养冰蓄水、拦雪水等，浇地七万多亩。西泡子、长胜甸子两个乡提出“不瞎一滴水”的口号，从3月中旬开始昼夜不停浇地，到3月28日半个月工夫，就突击浇地二万七千余亩；加上去年秋汇的一万二千亩，水浇地已占两个乡总播种面积的80％，他们提出春耕前要把全部耕地浇一遍。
    目前全旗已有80％以上的水井设置了提水工具。供销社从去年12月到现在先后供应了九百多台水车，各地依靠群众又创造了不少自制提水工具。这些新工具通过试验，有些已被推广。
