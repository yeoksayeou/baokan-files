    Vigorously Support Agricultural Middle Schools
    Nanjing Normal College Opens Teacher Training Class
    (Our Newspaper) News: Nanjing Normal College recently opened an agricultural middle school teacher training class to cultivate a group of qualified teachers.

    The first phase of the training class at the college is specifically to train 650 first-year teachers for agricultural middle schools in the Huaiyin Special District. The students come from high school graduates in the four cities and counties of Nanjing, Changzhou, Changshu, and Jiangyin, or demobilized soldiers and social intellectuals with a high school level of education. They study four courses: Chinese, mathematics, politics, and agricultural knowledge. In teaching, the educational principles of combining theory with practice and emphasizing the present over the past are implemented, so that students can not only teach but also lead students in production activities in the future. The training class started on April 15th and the study period is four months. (Jin Ling)
