Also Discussing "Acclimatization"
    Yìng Shānhóng
    I was very interested in the article "Acclimatization" published in the supplement on February 28th, and it also made me think of two kinds of acclimatization, so I'm here to talk about them.

    A person who has lived in one place for a long time and is used to it, suddenly moves far away to another place, often finds it difficult to get used to, and sometimes even gets sick. What's going on? If we can't explain it, we just call it "acclimatization."

    In the past, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Hainan Island were famous "malaria-infested areas." For many years, the saying "Wanning, Lingshui, once you go, you never return" has been circulating. In fact, it was clearly the rampant malaria parasite, but people said it was "miasma," and also that the mountains and water were bad, leading to "acclimatization." According to the health department's investigations in previous years, the vast majority of people on Hainan Island have suffered from several types of malaria. Most infants are infected with malaria within five months of birth. Therefore, they have developed some resistance to malaria. But people who come here for the first time can't stand it. In this sense, it can be said to be acclimatization. However, such acclimatization can be completely overcome. Since liberation, thanks to the efforts of the health department, malaria has been brought under control in Hainan Island and the Yunnan-Guizhou area, and the so-called "miasma" has long since disappeared.

    At the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains, people often suffer from goiter. The reason is a lack of iodine in the diet. In this area, there is little iodine in the water and soil, so the local plants and animals are also deficient in iodine. People who regularly drink the water and eat the grains, vegetables, fish, and meat from this area do not get enough iodine. A person's body contains twenty-five milligrams (one milligram is equal to one-thousandth of a gram) of iodine, of which the thyroid gland accounts for fifteen milligrams. Lack of iodine can cause the thyroid gland to swell. This is a regional disease called endemic goiter. This disease can also cause incomplete development, stunted growth, and intellectual decline. People suffering from this "acclimatization" only need to eat more iodine-rich seafood, such as kelp and seaweed, to overcome it.

    也谈“水土不服”
    应山红
    2月28日副刊上登了一篇文章“水土不服”，我很感到兴趣，同时也想到两种水土不服，来这里谈谈。
    一个人，在一个地方住久了，住惯了，忽然老远的搬到另外一个地方去住，往往不大习惯，有的时候，还会闹病。这是怎么回事呢？说不清楚，就管它叫“水土不服”。
    从前，云贵高原、海南岛都是著名的“瘴疠之乡”。多少年来，一直流传着“万宁、陵水，有去无回”这样的话。其实明明是疟原虫肆虐，却说是什么“瘴气”，而且还说是山不好，水不好，成了“水土不服”。根据卫生部门前些年的调查，海南岛上，绝大多数人都害过好些种疟疾。多数婴儿，在出生以后五个月以内就都感染了疟疾了。因此，他们对于疟疾有了一定的抵抗力。而初到这里来的人却受不了。在这种意义上，要说是水土不服，也可以说得过去的吧。然而像这样的水土不服，完全可以克服得了的。解放以后，由于卫生部门的努力，海南岛上也吧，云贵一带也吧，疟疾已经不能为虐，所谓“瘴气”，早已烟消云散了。
    秦岭北麓，以前常见有人害大脖子病的。原因是食物中缺碘。这个地方，水里土里都少碘，因而当地的植物动物也缺碘。人常喝这地方的水，吃这地方的粮食、蔬菜、鱼、肉，就得不到碘。一个人身体里有二十五毫克（一毫克等于千分之一克）的碘，其中甲状腺里就占了十五毫克。缺少碘，甲状腺会肿大。这是一种地方性的疾病，称为地方性甲状腺肿。这种病还会使人发育不全、生长停滞、智力减退。患这种“水土不服”的人，只要多吃些含碘多的海产食物，例如海带和紫菜等，就可以克服了。
