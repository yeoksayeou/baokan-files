    Organize Labor for Self-Reliance: Relief Recipients No Longer Need Relief
    Walking to the gate of Xinhua Village in Wuhan City, you can see a bright red big-character poster. This is not an opinion directed at cadres or the people's police, nor is it a criticism of the service attitude of the vegetable market, but the covenant of the labor service station established by the seven long-term relief households in Xinhua Village.
    Previously, these seven relief households received a government subsidy of 79 yuan per month. Through the mass rectification campaign, the Xinhua Village Residents' Committee organized the nine laborers from these seven families into a labor service station to support themselves through their own labor. The services they provide include: washing clothes, doing odd jobs, working as temporary replacements, and cleaning. Starting from April, they no longer need government relief. Based on the current situation, the average monthly income per person can reach more than 20 yuan. The clothes they wash are of good quality and cheaper than in the laundries, bringing a lot of convenience to the surrounding institutions and enterprises.

    组织劳动自力更生  救济户不要救济了
    走到武汉市新华村大门口，就可看到一张鲜红色的大字报，这不是对干部和人民警察提的意见，也不是对菜场服务态度的批评，而是新华村的七户长期救济户，组织成立的劳动服务站的公约。
    以前这七户救济户，政府每月得补助七十九元，通过全民整风，新华村居民委员会把这七家的九个劳动力组成了一个劳动服务站，用自己的劳动养活自己。他们服务的项目是：洗衣服，作零活，打替工，打扫卫生等。从4月起，他们再不用政府救济了。根据目前的情况看，平均每月每人的收入可达二十元以上。他们洗的衣服质量好，比洗衣店里便宜，给周围机关企业带来了很多方便。
