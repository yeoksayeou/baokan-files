Xinhua News Agency, April 14th.

    The head of the State Economic Commission met with a Xinhua News Agency reporter today to discuss the achievements made in industrial production in the first quarter of this year and the new situations and new problems that have emerged.

    The Economic Commission head said: The Economic Commission recently conducted a preliminary review of the national industrial production plan completion for the first quarter. Both central and local industries have exceeded the state plan, and the rate of production growth and the scale of overall leap forward are unprecedented in history. In particular, the trend of monthly production growth is very beneficial to the future continuous and major leap forward of China's industry. The vast number of workers and staff on the national industrial front have made a good start for the realization of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    The factors behind the rapid growth of industrial production in the first quarter of this year are the unprecedented labor enthusiasm and creativity displayed by the vast number of workers and staff, inspired by the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to catch up with Britain in fifteen years. Through the rectification movement that began last year, especially the in-depth unfolding of the Double-Anti Movement in the first quarter, they have been fully mobilized, focusing on the line of China's socialist construction - "more, faster, better, and more economical, go all out, aim high" - launching vigorous debates, criticizing conservative thinking and dogmatism, empiricism, breaking down old rules and regulations and technical procedures that restrict the further development of productive forces, eliminating the mysterious concepts of technology, and their thinking has begun to be liberated. Leadership styles and leadership methods have also greatly improved, thereby initiating a leap forward in production technology.

    With the liberation of thinking, people dare to innovate and experiment boldly, so that the production achievements in the first quarter are not only reflected in the rate of growth, but also in the unprecedented new situations in all aspects of production technology. The major technical innovation that appeared in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in the first quarter—three-tap steelmaking—is a vivid example of how the liberation of thinking promotes technological leap forward. After successfully testing the double-tap steelmaking method, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant once believed that there was only double-tap steelmaking in the world and did not think of further testing the multi-tap steelmaking problem. In February this year, the Party leaders raised this issue, encouraged the workers to "dare to think, dare to do," and enlightened all the workers. They immediately took action and successfully tested three-tap steelmaking in a very short time. Subsequently, the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant also quickly succeeded in its tests. The successful testing and popularization of the three-tap steelmaking method can greatly increase the output of China's existing open-hearth furnaces and can accelerate the construction speed of the steelmaking industry. The workers in the factory were greatly inspired by this experiment and said that this is the real liberation of thinking, eliminating the mysterious concepts of technology. In the metallurgical industry, in addition to three-tap steelmaking in the first quarter, new technologies such as mixed steelmaking, continuous rolling, continuous forging, and three-row tuyeres for converters have also been successfully tested. New records for the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces are constantly being refreshed. In the machinery industry, some small factories with rudimentary equipment in provinces such as Henan, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Liaoning, relying on veteran workers and a few technicians, broke through the conventional practices of trial-producing new products in the past without senior engineers and ready-made drawings, boldly conducted physical surveying and mapping, trial-producing and modifying at the same time, and manufactured many types of small tractors and universal vehicles suitable for local conditions. In the coal, electricity, textile, light industry and other departments, many technical innovations and creations have emerged during this period and have been quickly promoted. A mass technical innovation movement is gradually taking shape.

    During the rectification movement, industrial leadership departments and leaders at all levels have greatly improved their leadership style and methods. During this period, leading cadres of industrial departments and enterprises across the country implemented on-the-job labor, cultivated experimental plots, and sent cadres to lower levels, which strengthened ties with the masses, promptly discovered problems existing in production, and resolved them in a timely manner by adopting on-site meetings. The central industrial leading departments have all implemented the leadership methods of going deep into the front line, holding on-site meetings, organizing evaluations, and exchanging advanced experiences in a timely manner. In the first quarter, the Ministries of Metallurgy, Textile, Coal, and Petroleum, among others, held many on-site meetings and promotion meetings in various places to exchange advanced experiences, formulate leap forward targets and specific measures, and sign cooperation contracts. The meetings held by the central ministries all emphasized "70% politics, 30% business," first solving problems from a political and ideological perspective, exchanging ideas between superiors and subordinates, and promoting each other, and many specific problems were thus readily solved. The improvement of leadership style and leadership methods played a great role in the leap forward in production and technology.

    The development and strengthening of cooperation between regions, autonomous regions, and industries also played a role in promoting the growth of industrial production in the first quarter of this year. According to the experience of Taiyuan City in organizing regional cooperation, through cooperation meetings and professional meetings, organizing processing orders, mutually adjusting raw materials, and improving transportation efficiency, it not only promoted the production of state-owned factories and mines, but also enabled local industries to make a leap forward, while at the same time better supporting agriculture. Guiyang City organized large-scale cooperation in the industrial system, signed 450 agreements, mutually adjusted 35 tons of steel materials, 68 sets of machinery and equipment, and 68% of the 668 cooperation requests raised by various units were resolved on the spot. Cooperation between relevant regions, departments, or industries is currently developing further.

    The Economic Commission head said: The leap forward in thinking, style, production, technology, and other aspects on the industrial front in the first quarter of this year is now in full swing, and is bound to have a greater effect on production in the future, with infinitely magnificent prospects. However, in the process of rapid production growth, some problems that need to be paid attention to have also emerged.

    First, it is necessary to strengthen unified planning and strengthen the coordination and balance work between departments and regions. At present, the enthusiasm of local governments for running industries is very high. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are doing everything possible to develop industries, from automobiles, tractors, iron smelting, steelmaking, oil refining, coal mining to agricultural product processing and the utilization of wild plants, taking treasures everywhere and competing to show their splendor. This is an encouraging new trend. The central government's construction policy of running industries by the whole people and combining large, medium, and small enterprises has produced positive effects. In the future, the task of economic planning departments is to assist various regions in doing a good job of unified planning and strengthening the coordination and balance work between regions and departments. For example, in the planning of various regions to develop local metallurgical industries, attention has been paid to the accelerated development of pig iron, steel, and steel products, but how the raw material departments of the steel industry—mining, coking, refractory materials, and necessary non-ferrous metals—should develop accordingly should also be planned. In the machinery industry, attention has been paid to organizing existing machinery factories to vigorously support the drainage and irrigation machinery and agricultural machinery needed by agriculture, but at the same time, it is necessary to take care of the product development direction and original cooperative relationships determined by these factories according to the long-term national plan and reasonable division of labor, and do not change them casually. In terms of resource utilization and product supply and marketing, it is also necessary to pay attention to regional balance, especially for certain products that need to be sold to other places. Provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should have comprehensive plans and take into account the impact on other regions or departments. In these aspects, the central industrial authorities must also quickly keep up with the work of unified planning for the entire industry. In addition to encouraging localities to explore and utilize all their potential and rely on their own efforts, the central departments and large state-owned factories should take measures to organize forces to strengthen technical guidance and assistance to solve the problem of insufficient technical force felt by various localities in vigorously developing local industries.

    Second, encourage bold experimentation and promotion of raw material conservation and substitution, and strengthen the rational allocation of raw materials. This year, all industrial departments across the country, especially the departments producing raw materials, have made great leaps forward in production, and it is estimated that the total quantity of various major raw materials can meet the needs. However, at present, there are a few varieties or situations where the supply cannot keep up with the needs for a while. In order to implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, and to seek rapid leap forwards in industrial and agricultural production and capital construction, in addition to the vigorous increase in production and trial production of new varieties by raw material production departments, it is necessary to strengthen the work of raw material conservation and substitution and the rational allocation of existing reserves. In the first quarter, various regions have made great achievements in conserving raw materials. For example, Shanghai successfully trial-produced aluminum wire motors, saving copper wire. The Beijing No. 2 Machine Tool Factory modified the design of the bullhead planer according to China's usage conditions, and it is estimated that each machine can reduce 204 kilograms of steel, saving 367 tons a year. Various regions have also made many achievements in the utilization of wild plants. The experience in these areas is worth promoting vigorously. According to the survey, there is still a large gap in the raw material consumption quotas for various similar products, and the potential for savings is great. For example, the average weight per horsepower of the portable boilers produced by some factories in Shenyang is 120 kilograms, while the weight per horsepower of those produced in Shijiazhuang is about 70 kilograms, and that of those produced by the Beijing General Machinery Factory is only more than 40 kilograms. Various regions have also begun to carry out the rational allocation of raw materials. At present, the needs of farmland water conservancy should be met first, followed by important industrial equipment and key capital construction projects. It is necessary to conduct another inventory of the inventory materials of enterprises. Under the principle of not affecting the completion of production tasks by enterprises according to the plan, in addition to the necessary reserves stipulated for enterprise production, the excess part can be used uniformly by the leading organs of provinces and cities according to the urgency. The raw material reserve quotas of several enterprises can also be greatly compressed, and the raw material consumption quotas should be continuously reduced. In addition, there is currently a batch of equipment that has been idle and unused for many years in several departments and enterprises. All equipment that is not needed by the department and enterprise should be transferred out and dispatched uniformly by the local government to support local industries or the needs of other departments and other regions.

    Third, pay attention to controlling labor intensity, adjusting production rhythm, and paying attention to safe production. During this period, the vast number of workers and staff have high labor enthusiasm, and many cadres and workers consciously and voluntarily reduce rest time, working day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep. This spirit of selfless labor is very valuable, but excessive labor intensity and too much pressure cannot be sustained and can easily lead to production accidents. The competent authorities and enterprise leaders at all levels should pay attention to this situation. In order to cherish the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people and combine hard work with necessary rest, while encouraging the labor enthusiasm of the workers and staff, it is also necessary to take appropriate measures to appropriately control the labor intensity and give them the necessary rest time. After a production upsurge has passed for an appropriate period of time, it needs to be consolidated and rested for a short period of time (for example, a few days or ten days), and then turn to the second upsurge. We should guide workers to pay more attention to improving technology, improving tools, and improving operating methods, and pay attention to production safety and equipment maintenance and repair. Make the production upsurge continue to move forward rhythmically and achieve greater and more victories.

    Fourth, pay attention to grasping specific measures, grasping weak links, and effectively realizing the leap forward plan.

    At present, various industrial departments and regions have formulated this year's industrial production leap forward plan and have formulated measures to achieve it. However, in a few regions and departments and some enterprises, the leap forward targets are active, but the measures formulated are not specific enough, or they have not made effective measures for the weak links. Therefore, these units did not complete the plan for the first quarter well enough. In the spirit of "10 points of targets, 12 points of measures, 24 points of effort," the implementation of the plan in the first quarter should be summarized and checked in a timely manner, weak links should be identified, effective measures should be formulated, advanced experiences should be exchanged and promoted in a timely manner to ensure the completion of the production plan and promote the realization of the leap forward plan as scheduled.

    The Economic Commission spokesperson finally said: The practice in the first quarter fully proves that the slogan of "politics in command" put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is completely correct. When people's thinking is liberated and the line is correct, it will inevitably greatly promote the liberation of productive forces. The so-called "brilliant flowers in politics bear the rich fruits of the economy" vividly reflects such an objective reality. In the future, as long as all regions, departments, and enterprises further rely on the masses, strengthen political and ideological work, improve their work style, improve their work methods, and the various specific measures in the leap forward can keep up, it can be asserted that this year's national industry can not only complete the state's original plan, but also the leap forward plans formulated by various regions and departments will definitely be realized.

    经济委员会负责人谈第一季度建设成就
    政治挂帅经济放异采
    具体措施还必须紧紧跟上
    新华社14日讯　国家经济委员会负责人今天接见新华社记者，就今年第一季度工业生产所取得的成就和当前出现的新情况、新问题，发表谈话。
    经委会负责人说：经委会最近对第一季度全国工业生产完成计划的情况，作了初步的检查。中央和地方工业都超额完成了国家计划，生产增长的速度和全面跃进的规模是历年来从未有过的。特别是生产逐月增长的发展趋势，对今后我国工业不断地大的跃进，十分有利。全国工业战线上的广大职工群众已经为第二个五年计划的实现作出了良好的开端。
    今年第一季度工业生产迅速增长的因素，是广大职工群众在中共中央提出的十五年赶上英国的号召鼓舞下，发挥了前所未有的劳动热情和创造性。他们经过去年开始的整风运动，特别是在第一季度中深入展开的双反运动，已经充分发动起来，围绕着我国社会主义建设的路线——“多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游”，展开大鸣大放，批判保守思想和教条主义、经验主义，打破约束生产力进一步发展的旧规章制度和技术规程，破除技术上的神秘观念，思想开始解放，领导作风和领导方法也有很大的改进，从而在生产技术上也开始了跃进。
    思想开始解放，人们大胆革新，大胆试验，使今年第一季度的生产成就不仅表现在增长的速度方面，而且在生产技术各方面都出现了前所未有的新情况。第一季度在太原钢铁厂出现的重大的技术革新——三槽出钢，就是思想解放促使技术跃进的一个鲜明的例子。太原钢铁厂在试验成功双槽出钢法后，曾经认为目前世界上只有双槽出钢，没有想到进一步试验多槽出钢的问题。今年2月间，党的领导人提出了这个问题，鼓励职工们“敢想、敢做”，启发了所有的职工，他们立即行动起来，在很短时间内试验成功了三槽出钢。接着，重庆钢铁厂也迅速试验成功了。三槽出钢法的试验成功和普遍推广，可以大大增加我国现有平炉的产量，而且可以加快炼钢工业的建设速度。该厂职工通过这次试验受到很大启发，都说这才是真正的思想解放，破除了技术上的神秘观念。冶金工业中，第一季度除三槽出钢外，还试验成功了混合炼钢、连续轧钢、连续锻造和转炉三排风眼等新的技术。高炉和平炉的利用系数新纪录，不断的刷新。在机械工业中，河南、云南、广东、辽宁等省的一些设备简陋的小厂，依靠老工人和少数技术员，在没有高级工程师和现成图纸的情况下，冲破过去试制新产品的常规，大胆地进行实物测绘，一边试制，一边修改，制成了许多种适合当地条件使用的小型拖拉机和万能汽车。在煤炭、电力、纺织、轻工业等部门，这时期都出现了许多技术上的革新和创造，并且迅速得到推广。群众性的技术革新运动正在逐渐形成。
    在整风运动中，工业领导部门和各级领导干部在领导作风和领导方法上有了很大的改进。这一时期，全国各地工业部门和企业的领导干部，实行跟班劳动，搞试验田，干部下放，密切了与群众的联系，及时发现生产中存在的问题，并且采取现场会议的方法，及时加以解决。中央工业领导部门都实行了深入现场、开现场会议和组织评比、及时交流先进经验的领导方法。在第一季度，冶金、纺织、煤炭、石油等工业部在各地召开了多次现场会议和促进会议，交流先进经验，制订了跃进指标和具体措施，签订协作合同。中央各部召开的会议，都强调“七分政治、三分业务”，首先从政治思想上解决问题，上下交心，互相促进，许多具体问题因此迎刃而解。领导作风和领导方法的改进，对生产、技术的跃进起了很大的作用。
    地区、自治区和行业间协作的展开和加强，对今年第一季度工业生产的增长也起了促进的作用。根据太原市组织地区协作的经验，通过协作会议和专业会议，组织加工订货、互相调剂原材料、提高运输效率，既促进了国营厂矿的生产，也使地方工业向前跃进了一步，同时又更好地支援了农业。贵阳市组织工业系统大协作，签订了四百五十项协议书，互相调剂了钢铁材料三十五吨，机器设备六十八台，各单位提出的协作要求共六百六十八项，有68％当场得到了解决。现在有关的地区、部门或行业之间的协作，正在进一步发展。
    经委会负责人说：今年第一季度工业战线上出现的在思想、作风和生产、技术等各方面的跃进，现在正是方兴未艾，今后势必在生产中发生更大的效果，前景无限宏伟。但是在生产迅速增长的过程中，也出现了一些需要加以注意的问题。
    第一，需要加强统一规划，加强部门之间、地区之间的协作平衡工作。目前地方办工业的积极性很高，各省、市和自治区都在千方百计搞工业，从汽车、拖拉机、炼铁、炼钢、炼油、采煤到农产品加工和野生植物的利用，遍地取宝、争放异彩。这是令人鼓舞的新趋势，中央提出的全民办工业和大中小企业相结合的建设方针，已经产生了积极的效果。今后经济计划部门的任务，就是要协助各地区做好统一规划和加强地区间、部门间的协作平衡工作。例如，各地发展地方冶金工业的规划中，已经注意了生铁、钢和钢材的加速发展，但钢铁工业的原材料部门——采矿、焦炭、耐火材料和必需的有色金属如何相应发展，也应有所规划。在机械工业中，注意了组织现有的机械工厂大力支援农业需要的排灌机械和农业机械，但同时需要照顾这些工厂根据国家长远的规划、合理的分工所确定的产品发展方向和原有的协作关系，不要随便改变。在资源利用和产品的供销方面，也需要注意地区的平衡，特别是某些需要向外地销售的产品。省、市和自治区要有全面规划，要照顾到对其他地区或部门的影响。这些方面，中央各工业主管部门对全行业统一规划的工作，也必须迅速跟上。对于各地在大力兴办地方工业中感到的技术力量不足的问题，除了鼓励地方发掘和运用一切潜力，自力更生以外，中央部门和国营大厂应该采取措施，组织力量，加强技术指导和援助。
    第二，鼓励大胆试验和推广原材料的节约代用，加强原材料的合理调剂工作。今年全国各工业部门，特别是生产原材料的部门，生产有很大跃进，估计各种主要原材料的总数量可以供应需要。但目前有少数品种或在供应的时间上发生了一时赶不上需要的情况。为了贯彻多快好省的方针，求得工农业生产和基本建设的迅速跃进，除了原材料生产部门大力增产和试制新品种外，必须加强原材料的节约代用工作和现有储备的合理调剂。第一季度中，各地在节约原材料方面已经取得很大成绩。如上海试制成功铝线电动机，节约了铜线。北京第二机床厂根据我国的使用条件修改了牛头刨床的设计，预计每台可以减少二百零四公斤钢铁，一年可以节约三百六十七吨。各地在利用野生植物方面也有许多成就。这些方面的经验，值得大力推广。根据调查，目前各种同类产品的原材料消耗定额仍有很大差距，节约的潜力很大。如沈阳有的工厂生产的锅驼机，平均每匹马力体重达一百二十公斤，而石家庄出产的约七十公斤，北京通用机械厂出产的只有四十多公斤。在原材料的合理调剂方面，各地也已经开始着手进行。目前首先应该满足农田水利方面的需要，其次是重要的工业设备和基本建设重点项目。各地企业的库存物资有必要再进行一次清查，在不影响企业按计划完成生产任务的原则下，除了规定企业生产所必要的储备以外，多余部分，可以由各省、市领导机关根据轻重缓急，进行统一使用。若干企业的原材料储备定额还可以大大压缩，并且应不断地降低原材料消耗定额。此外，目前在若干部门和企业中还闲置着一批长年未经动用的设备，凡属该部门和企业不需要的，应该全部调出，由地方统一调度，支援地方工业或其他部门、其他地区的需要。
    第三，注意控制劳动强度，调节生产节奏，注意安全生产。这一时期，广大职工群众劳动热情高涨，不少干部和工人自觉自愿的减少休息时间，夜以继日、废寝忘食地工作。这种忘我劳动的精神是十分可贵的，但是过分提高劳动强度，弦子拉得太紧，是不能持久的，并且容易发生生产事故。各级主管部门和企业领导人应该注意这种情况，为了珍惜劳动人民的革命热情，使苦战和必要的休整相结合，一方面鼓励职工群众的劳动热情，同时需要采取适当的措施，适当地控制劳动强度，使他们有必要的休息时间。生产高潮经过一个适当时间以后，需要转入巩固和休整一个短时间（例如几天或十几天），然后再转入第二个高潮。应当引导工人更多地注意改进技术，改进工具，改进操作方法，并且注意生产的安全和设备的维护检修。使生产高潮有节奏地继续前进，取得更大更多的胜利。
    第四，注意抓具体措施、抓薄弱环节，切实有效地实现跃进规划。
    目前各工业部门和各地区都已经制定了今年工业生产的跃进计划，并且订出了实现的措施。但也有个别地区和部门及一些企业，跃进的指标是积极的，而订的措施则不够具体，或者没有针对薄弱环节，作出有效的措施，因此这些单位，第一季度的计划完成得不够好。应该按照“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”的精神，对第一季度执行计划的情况及时进行总结、检查，发现薄弱的环节，订出有效措施，及时交流先进经验，组织推广，以保证生产计划的完成，促使跃进计划的如期实现。
    经委会发言人最后说：第一季度的实践，充分证明了中共中央提出的“政治挂帅”的口号是完全正确的，人们的思想解放了，路线走对了，就必然大大地推动生产力的解放。所谓“政治上的灿烂之花，结出了经济上的丰硕之果”，正是生动地反映了这样的客观现实。今后各地区、各部门、各企业只要进一步依靠群众，加强政治思想工作，改进工作作风，改善工作方法，并且在跃进中各项具体措施能够跟得上，可以断言：今年全国工业不仅可以完成国家原定的计划，而且各地区、各部门制订的跃进计划也是一定能够实现的。
