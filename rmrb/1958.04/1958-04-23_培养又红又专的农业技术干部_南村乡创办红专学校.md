Cultivating Red and Expert Agricultural Technical Cadres
    Nancun Township Establishes Red and Expert School

    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to enable grassroots cadres to better lead the masses in building a new socialist countryside and to make agricultural production leap forward, the Nancun Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jincheng County, Shanxi Province, has established a grassroots cadre Red and Expert School.

    The school has selected nine people from eleven grassroots units in the township to form a study committee responsible for managing finances and formulating study systems. The classroom uses the original old opera stage, which the students voluntarily renovated. The township general branch secretary serves as the principal, and a person with socialist ideology and competent teaching ability is hired as a full-time teacher. The school officially opened on April 2. In terms of curriculum, there are six subjects: Chinese, arithmetic, biology, politics, experimental fields, and professional studies. (Wang Kefeng)

    培养又红又专的农业技术干部
    南村乡创办红专学校
    本报讯　中共山西晋城县南村乡委会为了使基层干部更好地领导群众建设社会主义新农村，使农业生产向前飞跃发展，建立了一所基层干部红专学校。
    这所学校已由乡里十一个基层单位选出九人组成学委会，负责管理财务、制定学习制度等事宜。教室利用原有的旧戏台，学员自动献工修整了一下。乡总支书记任校长，聘请一个具有社会主义思想又能胜任教学工作的人为专职教员。学校已于4月2日正式开学。课程方面，设有语文、算术、生物、政治、试验田、业务六科。　（王可风）
