Hard Work and Diligent Practice: Becoming Both Red and Expert
Zouping's Transferred Professors and Others Talk About Their Experiences in Labor Training

(Reported by our newspaper) According to Shandong Dazhong Daily, professors, lecturers, and some propaganda and cultural cadres transferred to Zouping County, Shandong, recently held a forum to exchange their experiences in labor training. Wang Zhongyin from the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Li Chunfang, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Zouping County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attended the forum.

At the meeting, everyone freely discussed their experiences in overcoming difficulties in daily life and labor over the past two months, as well as their ideological gains. They mentioned that through labor training, they gained a deeper understanding of the bourgeois individualism, disdain for working people, and separation of theory from practice among intellectuals. Yan Ziping, Associate Professor of Shandong Institute of Technology, said, "I have two main experiences in labor training. First, the more arduous and thrifty one's life is, the less one considers personal problems, and the healthier one's thinking becomes. Second, truly strengthening the concept of labor cannot be achieved by simply talking about it; it must be done through practice. Therefore, I feel that participating in physical labor is indeed the main way to reform intellectuals." Professor Jin Bang vividly described his ideological struggle during labor. He said, "Once, the commune assigned me and another member to carry over 130 pounds of cottonseed to a farmer. I used all my strength to carry it there, but unexpectedly, the farmer asked us to carry it back because there was no one to pick the cotton. At that moment, I panicked, thinking, 'Can I still lift it?' But then I thought, 'Can I still train if I am scared by difficulties?' So I gritted my teeth, mustered my strength, lifted it up, and delivered it to another household, successfully completing the task. This shows that labor training requires determination, courage, and perseverance. Labor is indeed the best way to train intellectuals." He also mentioned that he had never washed his own clothes before, but now he not only knows how to wash them but has also learned to sew and mend. Lei Jianhua, a lecturer at Shandong Normal College, had a deeper understanding of the relationship between the collective and the individual. He said, "From participating in the production team's labor, I personally experienced that the quality of one's labor is not only a personal matter but also directly affects the collective. Therefore, everyone should obey and cherish the collective."

Many comrades in their speeches examined their past ideas of looking down on working people and felt that the countryside is a "sea of knowledge" and that there are many things to learn from the peasants, especially the peasants' simple traditions, diligent habits, and clear class stance, which gave everyone a great education. Meng Fanjie, Associate Professor of Shandong Institute of Technology, said, "After coming to the countryside, my first impression was that cooperation has indeed changed the face of the countryside, and the peasants understand the superiority of cooperation. Their enthusiasm for labor greatly encouraged us. At the same time, seeing how the peasants cherish every cottonseed and every blade of grass, while our school often does not know how to cherish microscopes worth thousands of yuan, I further realized the great significance of carrying out the 'Double-Anti' Movement." Yang Daoping, an assistant teacher, talked about seeing the different attitudes of middle and poor peasants toward the grain issue, and realizing the correctness of Chairman Mao's proposal to firmly rely on the poor peasants in the countryside. She also talked about her experience in overcoming dogmatism in teaching only by connecting with reality. Zhang Jue, Director of Teaching Affairs at the attached Workers' and Peasants' Secondary School of Shandong Agricultural College, examined his past shortcomings in looking down on worker and peasant students; he felt that only by living with the workers and peasants can we cultivate feelings for them and become one with them.

Finally, Wang Zhongyin spoke. He hoped that the transferred cadres would work hard and diligently, persevere, give their hearts to the peasants, and become intellectuals who are both red and expert, and even redder and more expert. He asked the transferred cadres to not only learn from the peasants but also dedicate their knowledge to the peasants, and not to forget their professional and theoretical studies in labor.

    苦干苦炼　更红更专
    邹平下放教授等畅谈劳动锻炼体会
    本报讯　据山东大众日报报道：下放在山东邹平县的教授、讲师和部分宣传文教干部最近举行座谈会，交谈他们劳动锻炼的心得体会。中共山东省委宣传部王众音和中共邹平县委宣传部李纯芳部长参加了座谈会。
    会上，大家畅谈了两个多月以来度过了生活关、劳动关的情况，以及思想方面的收获。大家谈到，通过劳动锻炼，他们对知识分子的资产阶级个人主义思想、轻视劳动人民和理论脱离实际等问题有了更深的体会。山东工学院颜子平副教授说：“在劳动锻炼中我主要有两点体会。第一，人生活得越艰苦、俭朴，就很少去考虑个人问题，思想就会越健康。第二，真正加强劳动观念，光讲道理是不行的，必须通过实践才能作到。因此，我感到参加体力劳动，的确是改造知识分子的主要途径。”金榜教授生动地介绍了他参加劳动的思想斗争过程。他说：“有一次，社里分配我和另一社员抬一百三十多斤棉子送到农户，我拿出最大的力气才抬了去，不料这家农户因没有人手拣棉子，又要我们抬回去。当时我就心慌了。心想：还能抬起来吗？可一转念又想到：叫困难吓住，还能锻炼吗？于是咬咬牙，一鼓劲就抬起来，送到另外一户，胜利地完成了任务。这说明进行劳动锻炼必须要有决心、有勇气、有毅力，劳动确是锻炼知识分子的最好办法。”他还谈到过去自己从来没洗过衣服，现在不但会洗，缝缝补补也学会了。山东师范学院雷剑华讲师对集体与个人的关系有较深刻的体会。他说：“从参加生产队的劳动中，我亲身体验到一个人劳动的好坏，不但是个人的事，而且直接影响集体，因此，每个人应当服从集体、爱护集体。”
    很多同志在发言中检查了过去轻视劳动人民的思想，感到农村是“知识之海”，农民有很多东西值得学习，特别是农民那种朴素的传统、勤劳的习惯和明确的阶级立场，给大家很大的教育。山东工学院孟繁杰副教授说：“我来到农村以后，第一个印象就是合作化以后确实改变了农村面貌，农民都了解合作化的优越性，他们那股劳动干劲，给我们很大鼓舞。同时，看到农民对一粒棉种、一根草都那么珍惜，而我们学校对几千元一架的显微镜却往往不知爱惜，因此，更进一步认识到开展双反运动的伟大意义。”杨道平助教谈到从中、贫农对待粮食问题的不同态度上，看出毛主席提出在农村坚定地依靠贫农的道理。她还谈到只有联系实际才能克服教学中的教条主义的体会。山东农学院附设工农速成中学教导主任张觉检查了过去轻视工农学生的缺点；他感到只有和工农群众生活在一起，才能培养工农感情，和工农打成一片。
    最后，王众音发言。他希望下放干部苦干苦炼，坚持下去，把心交给农民，作又红又专、更红更专的知识分子。他要求下放干部既要向农民学习，又要把知识献给农民，在劳动中不要忘掉业务和理论学习。（附图片）
