    Qinghai, April 24 (from our newspaper) – On the vast grasslands of Qinghai, agricultural and livestock production cooperatives and joint state-private ranches are being established one after another. According to incomplete statistics as of April 20th, 421 new pastoral cooperatives and joint state-private ranches have been established this year, including 369 pastoral cooperatives and 52 ranches. The number of pastoral households joining the cooperatives and ranches accounts for 9.12% of the total pastoral households in the province. Seven districts and twelve townships in the province have basically realized the cooperation of animal husbandry.
    The socialist transformation of animal husbandry in most pastoral areas of Qinghai Province has shifted from the past pilot stage to a new stage of vigorous development. The pilot pastoral cooperatives have increased production year after year. According to the statistics of 28 pastoral cooperatives, compared with 1956, 8 cooperatives increased production by one to two times respectively, and 20 cooperatives increased production by 17% to 50% respectively. The income of 95% of the members increased. These vivid facts excite the broad masses of herdsmen. According to a survey of Wari Guan, Tiegai and other three townships in Gonghe County, 85% of the herdsmen demanded to establish cooperatives, especially the poor herdsmen were more determined. Many moving stories about the demand for establishing cooperatives have appeared on the grasslands. Some herdsmen in Chaka District, Dulan County, automatically jointly signed their names and concentrated their yurts. In Qilian County, three mutual aid groups automatically merged not long ago and established a pastoral cooperative, elected cooperative cadres and accountants, established a pastoral cooperative management committee, and the livestock were also herded together.
    In addition to the masses of herdsmen, some upper-class representatives such as herd owners also sympathized with and sponsored the socialist transformation, and actively demanded to establish joint state-private ranches.
    In order to actively and steadily further promote the socialist transformation of animal husbandry and promote the great leap forward in animal husbandry production, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of secretaries of prefectural and county committees in pastoral areas and some production ministers and cadres stationed in cooperatives from late March to early April. The meeting determined that this year, pastoral production cooperatives and joint state-private ranches should be actively developed on the basis of strengthening unity between and within ethnic groups and vigorously developing animal husbandry production. The meeting also put forward various measures to realize the great leap forward in animal husbandry production.
    Qinghai, April 24 (by our reporter Li Ying) – Through overall planning and mutual collaboration, the industrial departments and non-industrial departments of Qinghai Province are preparing to start local industries together, so that industrial flowers will bloom all over the Qinghai Plateau, which has a very weak industrial base, and promote the great development of agriculture and animal husbandry. This was determined at the Third Local Industry Conference recently convened by the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    In the next two years, various prefectures and counties in Qinghai Province will vigorously build and expand factories and mines for machinery, fertilizers, electricity, coal, metallurgy, food, etc. In order to accelerate the technical transformation of agriculture, a large number of hydropower stations will be built in the next two years, according to the province's crisscrossing rivers, rapid water flow, and abundant water resources. According to the characteristics that most of the province's soil is suitable for acidic fertilizers, chemical fertilizer plants, bone meal plants and mixed fertilizer plants will be established in prefectures and counties with raw materials such as coke, pyrite, and apatite. In order to better and more supply production materials to agricultural and pastoral areas, in addition to the province's existing agricultural tool and machinery factories responsible for the production of large and medium-sized agricultural and pastoral machinery and tools, each prefecture and county will establish one to several machinery repair factories, and agricultural tool repair stations (groups) will be established in each township to form a rural repair network.
    Qinghai Province is very rich in underground resources. Up to now, more than 40 kinds of mineral deposits have been discovered. Mining and smelting factories will be established in various places within two years. A large number of small coal mines will also be established. This year, there are 34 small coal mines that have been mined in Haibei and Huangzhong.
    In order to vigorously process agricultural and livestock products and make full use of more than 100 kinds of wild plants that have been discovered in the province, a number of factories for food industry, light industry, and building materials industry will be built within two years to meet the needs of the province in building farmland water conservancy and the lives of urban and rural people, export trade, etc.
    In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of various departments to accelerate the development of local industries, the meeting conducted overall planning, organized industrial departments and non-industrial departments to cooperate with each other, and the whole party and the whole people came to run industries. After research, various departments determined the scope of division of labor and were responsible for the planning, investment, technical guidance and business management of the industries under their jurisdiction. In addition to helping various places find mines, the Qinghai Office of the Ministry of Geology also transferred a group of geological personnel to equip each prefecture with a small team.
    In addition to the cooperation of the above departments, the province's agricultural tools, machinery, ironworks and other factories also carried out production cooperation and division of labor with various prefectures and counties. In addition to transferring a group of technical forces to support the new factories in various prefectures and counties, the province's old factories will also provide specific assistance from cultivating technical forces to product identification. Most of the various equipment required by the new factories in prefectures and counties will be manufactured by the province's factories through mutual cooperation.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xining, April 24th – The people of all ethnic groups in Huangzhong County, Qinghai Plateau, concentrated more than 90% of their labor force and carried out canal construction and drought resistance in a quick and decisive manner. In the six days from the 17th to the 22nd, they built 100 canals, with a total length of 1,394 kilometers, without spending a penny from the state.
    On April 17, as soon as the east dawned, an army of 100,000 male and female farmers marched out of the villages and towns composed of thousands of temporary tents at the foot of the mountains and fought on various mountains. In order to make it convenient for women to breastfeed their babies, temporary nurseries were set up at each canal construction site. The carpenters, blacksmiths and medical staff of this county all went to the construction site. Business personnel carried burdens of cigarettes, tea, snacks and other goods and wandered around the construction site. Even primary school teachers went to the construction site to teach classes.
    Every night, the staff of the water conservancy headquarters and sub-headquarters in Dongbao Township, Tumen Pass Township, and Weixin Township constantly received good news from various places; the progress of canal digging in various townships was not a few kilometers forward, but tens of kilometers or the completion of canals one by one. The enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups is unknown. The statistician counts an average of 12 or 3 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day, and some are as high as 23 or 4 cubic meters. The masses are not only working hard physically, but also constantly improving tools and methods of digging earth. The masses of Pingan Town rushed to make 350 bulldozers overnight to replace carrying soil with back buckets. These tools increased the efficiency of digging soil by several times to more than ten times. In order to vigorously develop water conservancy, the Ahong of the mosque led the Mullahs to the construction site to wield cross picks; the newly married Hui women also walked out of the gate and went to the mountains to work.
    In the 2,500 square kilometers of Huangzhong, mountains crisscross and there are 1.29 million mu of cultivated land. Except for a small part of the mountain area (mountains slightly higher than shallow mountains) with more rain, there were only 148,000 mu of water land before last winter. Since the beginning of this year, there has been a severe shortage of rain. In order to realize the "Four, Five, Eight" ahead of schedule, overcome the current severe drought, and change the situation of relying on the sky for food for thousands of years, the farmers of all ethnic groups such as Han, Hui and Tibetan in the county, under the direct leadership of the Huangzhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, fought against the earth with the revolutionary heroic spirit as if splitting bamboo, asking for water from the mountain and grain from the shallow mountain, so as to ensure a bumper harvest without rain.

    青海高原吹遍跃进之风
    农牧业和工业同时并举
    本报西宁24日电　在青海的广阔草原上，畜牧业生产合作社和公私合营牧场一个接一个地建立起来。截至4月20日的不完全统计，今年已新建牧业社和公私合营牧场四百二十一个，其中牧业社三百六十九个，牧场五十二个。入社入场的牧户占全省总牧户的9.12％。全省已经有七个区、十二个乡基本实现了畜牧业合作化。
    青海省大部分牧业地区的畜牧业社会主义改造，已从过去的典型试办阶段转入蓬勃发展的新阶段。试办的牧业社连年增产。据二十八个牧业社的统计，1957年和1956年相比，有八个社分别增产一倍到二倍，有二十个社分别增产17％到50％，社员有95％增加了收入。这些活生生的事实激动着广大牧民群众。据共和县瓦里关、铁盖等三个乡调查，有85％的牧民要求办社，特别是贫困牧民要求更加坚决。草原上出现了许多要求办社的动人事例。都兰县茶卡区有些牧民自动联名，集中帐房。祁连县有三个互助组不久以前自动合并，建立了牧业社，并选出社干部、会计，成立了牧业社管理委员会，牲畜也合了群。
    除了牧民群众外，一些牧主等上层代表人物也同情、赞助社会主义改造，积极要求办公私合营牧场。
    为了积极稳步地进一步开展畜牧业社会主义改造和促进畜牧业生产大跃进，中共青海省委曾于3月下旬到4月初召开了牧业区州、县委书记和部分生产部长、驻社干部会议。会议确定，今年应在加强民族间与民族内部团结和大力发展畜牧业生产的基础上，积极发展牧业生产合作社和公私合营牧场。会议并提出了实现畜牧业生产大跃进的各项措施。
    本报西宁24日电　记者李瑛报道：统筹安排，互相协作，青海省工业部门和非工业部门准备一齐动手来兴办地方工业，使工业基础十分薄弱的青海高原上遍地开放工业之花，促进农牧业大发展。这是中共青海省委最近召开的第三次地方工业会议上确定的。
    青海省各州、县在今明两年内，将大力新建、扩建机械、肥料、电力、煤炭、冶金、食品等厂矿。为了加速农业技术改造，根据省内河流纵横，水流较急，水力资源丰富的情况，今明两年将建设大批水电站。根据本省土壤大部分适用酸性肥料的特点，将分别在有焦炭、硫铁矿、磷灰石等原料的州、县，建立化学肥料厂、骨粉厂和混合肥料厂。为了更好、更多地供应农牧业区的生产资料，除省的原有几个农具、机械厂负责生产大、中型农牧机具外，各州、县将建立一个到几个机械修配厂，并在各乡建立农具修配站（组），组成农村修配网。
    青海省地下资源十分丰富，到目前止已发现矿藏四十多种。两年内将在各地分别建立采矿及冶炼工厂。还将建立大批小型煤矿。今年海北、湟中两地已开采的小型煤矿就有三十四处。
    为了大力进行农、牧产品加工和充分利用本省已经发现的一百多种野生植物，两年内将建一批食品工业、轻工业、建筑材料工业的工厂，以满足本省兴修农田水利和城乡人民生活、出口贸易等需要。
    为了调动各个部门的积极因素，以加速地方工业的发展，会议进行了统筹安排，组织工业部门和非工业部门互相协作，全党全民都来办工业。各部门经过研究，确定分工范围，负责管理所管工业的规划、投资、技术指导和经营管理等。地质部青海办事处，除帮助各地找矿外，还抽调出一批地质人员为每个州配备一个小队。
    除上面各部门的协作外，省的农具、机械、铁工等厂还和各州、县进行了生产协作和分工。省的老厂除了抽出一批技术力量支援各州、县新厂外，还将从培养技术力量直到产品鉴定，进行具体帮助。州、县新厂所需的各种设备，绝大部分由省的各厂互相协作来承制。
    新华社西宁24日电　青海高原的湟中县各族人民，集中了90％以上的劳动力，以速战速决的方式进行修渠抗旱，从17日到22日的六天中修渠百条，全长一千三百九十四公里，国家没有花一文钱。
    4月17日，东方刚发亮，十万个男女农民组成的劳动大军，从山脚下千百个临时帐篷组成的村镇中走出，战斗在各个山头上。为了使妇女给幼儿哺乳方便，每个渠道工地都成立起临时托儿所。这个县的木匠、铁匠和医务人员都走上了工地。商业人员挑着烟、茶、点心等货品担子在工地上串来串去，连小学教员也到工地教课去了。
    每当晚间，住在东堡乡、土门关乡、维新乡的水利总、分指挥部里的工作人员，不断地接到各处报捷的电话；各个乡挖渠的进展不是前进几公里，而是几十公里或是一条条渠道的竣工。各族农民的干劲不知有多大，计工员每天的统计是每人平均十二、三土方，有的高达二十三、四土方。群众不是光拼体力劳动，而是不断地在改进工具和挖土方法。平安镇群众一夜赶制三百五十辆推土车，代替背斗垫运土，这些工具使挖土效率提高几倍至十几倍。为了大兴水利，清真寺的阿訇领着满拉们到工地抡十字镐；回民新出嫁的媳妇也走出大门上山劳动。
    二千五百平方公里的湟中境内，山脉纵横，有耕地一百二十九万亩，除一部分脑山（比浅山稍高的山）多雨区外，去年冬季前仅有水地十四万八千亩。今年以来，雨水奇缺。县内汉、回、藏等各族农民为了提前实现“四、五、八”，战胜当前的严重干旱，改变千百年来靠天吃饭的状况，在中共湟中县委直接领导下，以革命的英雄气概势如破竹地同大地进行搏斗，向脑山要水，向浅山要粮，做到无雨保丰收。（附图片）
