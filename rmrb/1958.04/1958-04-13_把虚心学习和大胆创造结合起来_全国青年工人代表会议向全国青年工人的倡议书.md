Dear young workers:
    We are honored to have been entrusted by you to come to Shanghai, the cradle of the Chinese working class revolution, to hold the National Youth Workers' Representative Conference. In addition to the representatives of young workers from all over the country and various industries, we also had the honor of having our respected predecessors—old workers—and our close brothers—representatives of young peasants and young students. At this meeting, we listened to the reports from the responsible comrades of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and exchanged experiences with each other. During these days, every moment, we deeply felt the love of the Party, the care of our predecessors, and the warm friendship of our young friends. Now, the meeting is about to end. Standing in front of the statue of our great and kind Chairman Mao, everyone is thinking excitedly: we ordinary young people have only fulfilled our due responsibilities to the country under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, but the Party and the people have given us such high honor and such great encouragement. This makes us feel even more keenly the importance of our responsibilities. Our determination, our vows, are not enough to express in words. Let us ten million young workers together prove with our actions that each of us is a good son and daughter of the Party and the people. Wherever the Party points, we will rush there. Whatever the Party calls for, we will do. We must turn the Party's great ideals into a glorious reality.

    Comrades, a new page in the history of our country is unfolding. The old system has been overthrown, and the new system has been established. We have become the masters of society and are learning to be the masters of nature. Our hands have been liberated from the shackles of the old system, and our minds are constantly breaking free from the shackles of old ideas and old habits. Our liberated people have created and are creating amazing miracles. Now, on the vast land of our country, the drums of the Great Leap Forward are resounding everywhere; inside and outside our venue, every day is a chorus of good news. Our industry is leaping forward, our agriculture is leaping forward, our science and culture are leaping forward, and all our undertakings are leaping forward at an astonishing pace. Things that were thought impossible in the past have now been accomplished. Things that used to take a long time to complete are now being done much earlier. The face of our country is changing rapidly every day and every hour.

    In order to make our country change from backward to advanced, from poor to rich, even faster, the Party has put forward the great call to catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more. Striving to achieve this great call is the most glorious historical task of our young workers.

    In order to better shoulder this great and arduous historical task, we young workers must strive to be: diligent, thrifty, red, and expert.

    The Party teaches us: to build socialism in our "poor and blank" country, we must implement the general construction policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and of going all out and aiming high. Let all our young workers answer loudly: we must abide by the Party's teachings, work hard, build the country with diligence and thrift, become diligent and thrifty good workers, and become promoters of socialist construction. Every one of our young workers must love our labor and love our work in our respective fields. In our country, there is no distinction between noble and base labor. Our lofty ideals must be realized through ordinary labor. We must love all work that can create wealth for the country and benefit the people, and we must do it diligently. We must cherish time, for time is the most precious thing. Every one of our young workers must make full use of working hours and not waste a minute or a second. We must do everything possible to tap production potential, cherish machinery and equipment, improve product quality, and strengthen the comprehensive utilization of materials, so that not a single drop of wealth is damaged. In our hands, waste products can be turned into gold, and old machines can create miracles. We must carry forward the attitude of being masters of our own affairs, run all undertakings according to the principle of spending less money and doing more things, and do everything ourselves that we can, without asking the state for money. In our personal lives, we must advocate hard work and plain living, a thrifty and frugal style, and oppose extravagance and waste, and oppose the grand young master style of showing off and seeking enjoyment.

    The Party teaches us to consciously transform our thinking, improve our skills, and train ourselves to become a new generation that is both highly conscious and proficient in our respective fields, both red and expert. Let all our young workers answer loudly: we must follow the Party's teachings, study hard, train diligently, strive for rapid growth politically and technically, and strive to become red and expert early, thoroughly red and deeply expert.

    Every one of our young workers should clearly understand our responsibilities and have a broad vision and great aspirations. We must establish the collectivist thinking of "one for all, all for one," work diligently, consciously abide by discipline, always put the interests of the country first, endure hardship before others and enjoy benefits after others, resolutely resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and constantly improve our class consciousness. Let the revolutionary character of our working class be as bright as if it were dyed with "reactive dyes," forever bright and never fading.

    Our young workers must also study diligently and practice hard, advance bravely towards culture, technology, and science, and completely build our socialist industry and agriculture on the basis of the most advanced modern science and technology. The great victory of the current nationwide rectification movement has created extremely favorable conditions for technological innovation. Our young workers must constantly improve our cultural level, study and research technology diligently, and become a brave vanguard in technological innovation and learning and mastering new technologies. Learning and researching technology must begin with not being complacent. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind." We must learn from the old workers and from everyone with experience. Learning and researching technology must not be afraid of failure or difficulties; we must dare to think, dare to do, and dare to delve into things. "Even if there are thousands of difficulties, all it takes is one determination." We must learn everything that is advanced in the world; we must dare to create what does not exist in the world. As long as we combine doing with learning, and combine modest learning with bold creation, we will surely be able to make greater contributions to the great cause of socialist construction.

    Comrades, the people of the whole country are expecting us, and all the young people in the country are looking up to us. Only by constantly strengthening our self-transformation and self-cultivation, and by constantly creating new achievements in our own labor posts, can we live up to the ardent expectations of the Party, the people, and the young people of the whole country. Here, we would like to put forward the following specific proposals, and work together with the ten million young men and women workers across the country to encourage each other.

    First, extensively launch a movement to break quotas and create new records. Young workers in all industries must strive to find tricks, tap potential, use wisdom, and learn technology, and while constantly improving product quality, actively launch "quota-breaking" activities, strive to overfulfill annual plans, and complete the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule. Greatly increase labor productivity.

    Second, we must extensively launch conservation activities, rationally use raw materials, recycle and utilize waste materials, and actively put forward rationalization proposals. Every one of our young workers should formulate our own annual conservation plan according to our conditions. The six million young industrial workers across the country should strive to save 3 billion yuan throughout the year to expand the country's production investment.

    Third, extensively carry out technical learning, technical research, and technical experimentation activities to promote the continuous innovation of industrial technology. Young apprentices must learn diligently from old workers and quickly master basic operating techniques and basic knowledge. All young apprentices should constantly improve their technical proficiency, learn and promote advanced experience, and strive to master a second or multiple technologies. With the help and guidance of old workers and engineering technicians, young workers should make full use of their spare time to conduct research, experiment, create, and invent new technologies, and actively help enterprises solve key production problems.

    Fourth, carry out loving mutual assistance activities for workers who are lagging behind in production, and help them quickly catch up with the level of advanced workers. All young workers who are lagging behind in production must be determined to learn from advanced workers. All workers who are advanced in production should patiently help the comrades around them to progress, and humbly learn from their strengths. Achieve the goal of mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths, and improving together.

    Fifth, every one of our young workers must learn to manage our households diligently and thriftily, and develop a hard-working and simple lifestyle. For all household expenses, do not spend money on things that can be avoided, and never spend more than necessary. Make a budget at the beginning of the month and settle accounts at the end of the month. On the basis of planned expenditure and saving expenses, every one of our young workers must formulate an annual and monthly savings plan, and the ten million young workers across the country should strive to save 300 million yuan throughout the year to support national construction.

    Sixth, we must always care about national affairs and actively study the Party's policies. Carry out an activity of "everyone reading the newspaper, reading the newspaper every day" among the young workers across the country. Organize reading groups extensively, and establish reading newspapers as a system, just like eating on time every day.

    Seventh, carry out the "ten characters a day" literacy movement. Strive to ensure that all illiterate young workers are completely out of illiteracy within two years. All literate young workers must actively undertake the obligation of eliminating illiteracy, and make full use of their spare time to constantly improve their cultural level.

    Eighth, we must strengthen our ties with rural youth through various methods and carry out activities to support agricultural construction. In addition to striving to improve product quality, reduce production costs, and supply more, better, and cheaper means of production and livelihood to the countryside, we can also use holidays to help repair farm tools free of charge, impart technology, and adopt methods such as mutual correspondence and sending books and newspapers to enhance the friendship between workers and peasants.

    Dear comrades: Time is flying, and the motherland is leaping forward. We should accelerate our pace, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and make the advanced even more advanced. We fully believe that when the motherland and the people review our work, every one of our young workers will be able to say without shame: In the great struggle to "catch up with Britain" and accelerate the construction of the motherland, we have contributed everything we could contribute.

    Let all our young workers, in the ranks of the great leap forward of the whole people, ride the wind and waves and forge ahead bravely!

                     National Youth Workers' Representative Conference
                                 April 12, 1958

    把虚心学习和大胆创造结合起来
    全国青年工人代表会议向全国青年工人的倡议书亲爱的青年工人同志们：
    我们光荣地接受了你们的委托，来到我国工人阶级革命的摇篮——上海，举行了全国青年工人代表会议。参加这次会议的，除了来自祖国各地、各产业青年工人的代表以外，还有我们敬爱的前辈——老工人，和我们亲密的兄弟——青年农民和青年学生的代表。在这次会议上，我们听取了全国总工会和团中央负责同志的报告，相互交流了经验。在这些日子里，每时每刻，我们都深深地感受着党的爱抚、前辈们的关怀和青年朋友们热诚的友谊。现在，会议就要结束了。我们站在伟大慈祥的毛主席的像前，每个人心里都在激动地想：我们这些普普通通的年轻人，只不过在党和毛主席的教导下，为祖国尽了自己一份应尽的责任，而党和人民，却给了我们这么高的荣誉，这么大的鼓舞。这使我们更加感到自己责任的重大。我们的决心，我们的誓愿，单用语言来表达是不够的。让我们一千万青年职工在一起，用自己的行动来证明：我们个个都是党和人民的好儿女。党指向那里，我们就奔向那里。党号召干什么，我们就干什么。我们一定要把党的伟大理想，变成光辉的现实。
    同志们，我们祖国的历史正在展开新的一页。旧制度打垮了，新制度建立了。我们做了社会的主人，正在学会做大自然的主人。我们的双手从旧制度的枷锁中解放了出来，我们的头脑也正在不断地摆脱着旧思想和旧习惯的束缚。我们解放了的人民，创造了和正在创造着惊人的奇迹。现在，在我们祖国广阔的土地上，到处正响着跃进的锣鼓；在我们的会场内外，每天也都是一片报捷的声音。我们的工业在跃进，我们的农业在跃进，我们的科学文化在跃进，我们的一切事业都在一日千里地跃进着。过去认为做不到的事情，现在已经做到了。过去要很长时间才能做成功的事，现在都大大地提前了。我们祖国的面貌，每天、每时都在迅速地改变着。
    为了更快地使我们的祖国由落后变为先进，由贫穷变为富强，党向我们提出了在十五年或者更多一点时间内，在钢铁和其他主要工业生产品方面，赶上或者超过英国的伟大号召。为实现这个伟大号召而努力奋斗，是我们青年工人最光荣的历史任务。
    为了更好地担当起这个伟大而艰巨的历史任务，我们青年工人，必须努力做到：又勤、又俭、又红、又专。
    党教导我们：要在我们这个“又穷又白”的大国中建成社会主义，必须实行多快好省、鼓起干劲、力争上游的建设方针。让我们全体青年工人响亮地回答：我们一定要遵照党的教导，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国，成为勤劳的节俭的好工人，成为社会主义建设的促进派。我们每个青年工人，都要热爱自己的劳动，热爱本行的工作。在我们的国家里，劳动是没有贵贱之分的。我们远大的理想，要靠平凡的劳动来实现。凡是能为国家创造财富，能为人民谋取福利的工作，我们都要喜爱，都要勤勤恳恳的做好。我们要爱惜时间，时间是最宝贵的。我们每个青年工人，都要充分利用工时，不浪费一分钟、一秒钟。我们要千方百计地挖掘生产潜力、爱护机器设备、提高产品质量、加强物资的综合利用，不使一点一滴的财富受到损害。在我们手里，废品也能变黄金，旧机器也能创奇迹。我们要发扬主人翁的劳动态度，以少花钱多办事的原则，举办一切事业，只要自己能动手的，都要自己动手，不向国家要钱。在个人生活上，我们要提倡艰苦朴素，勤劳俭朴的作风，反对奢侈浪费，反对讲阔气、讲享受的大少爷作风。
    党教导我们，要自觉地改造思想，提高本领，把我们自己锻炼成为既有高度觉悟又是精通本行业务技术的又红又专的新一代。让我们全体青年工人响亮地回答：我们一定要按照党的教导，努力学习，刻苦锻炼，争取政治上和技术上的迅速成长，争取早红早专，红透专深。
    我们每一个青年工人，都应当清楚地认识自己的责任，有远大的眼光和伟大的志愿。我们要树立起“我为人人，人人为我”的集体主义思想，勤勤恳恳的劳动，自觉地遵守纪律；时时刻刻把国家利益摆在前头；处处吃苦在前，得利在后；坚决抵制资产阶级思想对我们的侵蚀，不断提高阶级觉悟。使我们工人阶级的革命本色，像用“活性染料”染成的那样，永远鲜艳，永不退色。
    我们青年工人还要勤学苦练，顽强地向文化进军，向技术进军，向科学进军，把我们社会主义的工业和农业，完全建立在现代最先进的科学技术的基础上。现在全民整风运动的伟大胜利，已经为革新技术创造了极为有利的条件。我们青年工人一定要不断地提高文化水平，刻苦地学习和钻研技术，在革新技术和学习掌握新技术当中，成为一支勇敢的尖兵。学习和钻研技术一定要从不自满开始。我们要时刻记住毛主席的教导：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。我们要向老工人学习，向一切有经验的人学习。学习和钻研技术一定要不怕失败、不畏艰难；一定要敢想、敢做、敢钻。“那怕千条困难，只要一条决心”。世界上先进的，我们都要学会；世界上没有的，我们要敢于创造。只要我们把干和学结合起来，把虚心学习和大胆创造结合起来，我们就一定能够在伟大的社会主义建设事业中作出更大的贡献。
    同志们，全国人民在期待着我们，全国青年都仰望着我们。我们只有不断加强自我改造和自我锻炼，在自己的劳动岗位上不断创造出新的成绩，才能不辜负党、人民和全国青年对我们的殷切期望。在这里，我们愿意提出以下的一些具体倡议，同全国一千万男女青年职工一起，共同努力，互勉互励。
    第一、广泛开展突破定额，创造新纪录运动。一切行业的青年职工都要努力找窍门，挖潜力，用智慧，学技术，在不断提高产品质量的同时，积极展开“突破定额”活动，争取做到超额完成年度计划，提前一年完成五年计划。把劳动生产率大大提高一步。
    第二、我们要广泛展开节约活动，合理使用原材料，回收和利用废弃材料，积极提出合理化建议。我们每个青年职工，应当根据条件定出自己全年的节约计划。全国六百万青年产业工人，争取全年节约三十亿元，来扩大国家的生产投资。
    第三、广泛开展技术学习、技术研究和技术试验活动，促进工业技术的不断革新。青年徒工要刻苦地向老工人学习，迅速掌握起基本的操作技术和基础知识。所有的青年徒工，都应当不断提高技术的熟练程度，学习和推广先进经验，并且努力争取掌握第二种或多种技术。在老工人和工程技术人员的帮助指导下，青年职工应当充分利用业余时间，进行新技术的研究、试验、创造和发明，积极帮助企业解决生产上的关键问题。
    第四、开展对生产落后工人的友爱互助活动，帮助他们迅速赶上先进工人的水平。所有在生产上落后的青年职工，都要下定决心，向先进工人学习。一切生产上先进的工人，都应当耐心帮助周围的同志进步，并且虚心学习他们的长处。达到相互学习、相互帮助、取长补短、共同提高的目的。
    第五、我们每个青年职工都要学会勤俭持家，养成艰苦朴素的生活作风。一切家庭开支，可花可不花的就不花，可以少花的决不多花。做到月初有预算，月底有结算。在计划开支、节省费用的基础上，我们每个青年职工都要制定每年每月的储蓄计划，全国一千万青年职工争取全年储蓄三亿元，来支援国家建设。
    第六、我们要经常关心国家大事，积极学习党的政策。在全国青年职工中开展一个“人人读报，天天读报”的活动。把读报小组广泛地组织起来，把读报形成制度，就像每天按时吃饭一样。
    第七、开展“每天十个字”的识字运动。争取在二年内，使所有不识字的青年职工，全部脱离文盲状态。一切识字的青年职工，都要主动的承担扫除文盲的义务，并且充分利用业余时间，不断提高自己的文化水平。
    第八、我们要通过各种方法加强同农村青年的联系，开展支援农业建设的活动。除了要努力提高产品质量，降低生产成本，为农村供应更多更好更便宜的生产和生活资料以外，我们还可以利用假日，义务帮助修理农具，传授技术，采用相互通信、赠送书报等办法，增进工农青年的友谊往来。亲爱的同志们：时间在飞奔，祖国在跃进。我们应当快马加鞭，学先进，赶先进，先进的更先进。我们完全相信：当祖国和人民检阅我们工作的时候，我们每一个青年工人都将能够毫无愧色地说：在“追赶英国”、加速祖国建设的伟大斗争中，我们贡献了自己能够贡献的一切。
    让我们全体青年工人，在万马奔腾的全民大跃进的行列中，乘风破浪，奋勇前进吧！
