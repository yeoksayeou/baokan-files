Xinhua News Agency, Manila, April 18th: Philippine President Garcia told United Press International reporters on the 17th that he agreed to allow the United States to establish nuclear missile bases in the Philippines.

Garcia said, "If the defense of this region requires missiles, I think some kind of agreement can be reached."

Garcia is scheduled to visit the United States in June this year. He said he hopes to "receive sufficient economic assistance" during this trip.

In his conversation with UPI reporters, Garcia also made malicious slanders against China.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 18th: Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda told reporters on the 18th, referring to Philippine President Garcia's expression of agreement to allow the United States to store nuclear weapons in his country, that this is a very serious matter for Indonesia.

Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Hardi said on the 18th, expressing his opinion on the same issue, that given the possible consequences of establishing nuclear weapons bases in a country as close as the Philippines, the Indonesian government has to find ways to prevent this danger. Hardi said he hopes the Philippines will appropriately consider and respect the interests of its neighbors.

Hardi also warned the United States to stop pursuing policies that harm Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 19th: Jakarta's "Independent" newspaper published a commentary today saying that Philippine President Garcia's permission for the United States to establish nuclear weapons bases in the Philippines is very surprising.

The newspaper said that every Asian country would oppose the storage of nuclear weapons on Asian soil. What Asian countries need is not destructive nuclear weapons, but a peaceful and stable situation that can improve economic and social conditions.

The newspaper also said that in order to prevent the realization of the Philippine President's dangerous attempt for Asia, it is necessary for Asian countries to exchange views on this issue.

    加西亚想用导弹基地换美元
    印度尼西亚表示不能漠视
    新华社18日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾总统加西亚17日对合众社记者表示他同意让美国在菲律宾建立核导弹基地。
    加西亚说：“如果这个地区的防御需要导弹的话，我想可以取得某种协议。”
    加西亚预定在今年6月到美国进行访问。他说，他希望此行“得到足够的经济援助”。
    加西亚在对合众社记者的谈话中还对中国进行了恶意诽谤。
    新华社雅加达18日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达在18日对新闻记者谈到菲律宾总统加西亚表示同意让美国在他的国家内储存核武器的问题时说，这对印度尼西亚说来，是一个十分严重的问题。
    印度尼西亚副总理哈迪在18日就同一个问题发表意见说，鉴于在菲律宾这样近的国家内建立核武器基地可能产生的后果，印度尼西亚政府不得不设法防止这种危险。哈迪说，他希望菲律宾将适当考虑和尊重它的邻国的利益。
    哈迪还警告美国停止奉行损害印度尼西亚的政策。
    新华社雅加达19日电　雅加达“独立报”今天发表评论说，菲律宾总统加西亚允许美国在菲律宾建立核武器基地这件事是非常令人惊奇的。
    这家报纸说，每一个亚洲国家都会反对在亚洲的土地上贮存核武器。亚洲各国所需要的不是破坏性的核武器，而是能够改善经济和社会条件的和平、稳定的局势。
    这家报纸还说，为了使菲律宾总统的这个会给亚洲带来危险的企图不致实现，亚洲国家有必要就这个问题交换意见。
