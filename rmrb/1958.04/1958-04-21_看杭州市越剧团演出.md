    Watching the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe Perform
    Dai Bufan
    A few days before the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe arrived in Beijing, I heard that they were going to perform about eliminating the Four Pests and the Great Leap Forward in the countryside... I wondered: Yue Opera, can it really do that?
    After watching their last program in rehearsal, "A Thousand Li in a Day," I was deeply moved. I felt like the 87-year-old grandma in "A Thousand Li in a Day," judging new things by old standards, which is no longer acceptable today. Overall, I didn't find any disharmony between their traditional forms and the new content of life; on the contrary, these programs, as simple as pencil sketches, as sharp as daggers, were so lively, fresh, and full of the scent of earth!
    These wonderful artistic works, with their rich and fresh content of life, can only be compared to the "bamboo shoots after the rain" in Jiangnan at this time. Here, I saw the passion of the people of my hometown in the Great Leap Forward. However, the momentum of this leap forward cannot be compared to the growth of bamboo shoots; it is truly like the Qiantang tide on the eighteenth day of the eighth month!—As I write this article, it is raining outside the window, and I can't help but think of Su Manshu's poem "When will I return to see the Zhejiang tide?"; however, the Qiantang tide in my memory, compared to the high tide of the Great Leap Forward of the people on both sides of the Qiantang River that I felt on the stage, seems so insignificant!
    These dramatic programs depicted various figures in the Great Leap Forward. There was a girl who couldn't be stopped by her mother and climbed out of the window on New Year's Eve to build a reservoir; there was an old man who didn't entertain his son-in-law on New Year's Day in order to accumulate fertilizer; there was a silk reeling workshop director who was advanced ten minutes ago but became backward after a ten-minute break; there was an innocent and lovely Young Pioneer who used a loudspeaker to persuade people not to spit everywhere; and there was also an intellectual who wrote reports about eliminating the Four Pests all night long, while his house was full of flies and mosquitoes... In short, after watching these programs, which are pleasing in form, fresh in content, and constantly make people laugh easily and happily, you will feel a force to advance further and further from the depths of your heart amidst the real and rich life experiences!
    Each program vividly reflects things that happened yesterday or are still continuing to happen. They are a good propaganda for the Party's policies; some programs even incorporate newspaper editorials, but because the authors all start from writing about people, it doesn't seem stiff or mechanical at all. In "A Full House of Red," the unhygienic person speaks almost entirely in the words of newspaper editorials, logically and eloquently, even "testing" the Young Pioneers who come to help him clean up. However, because he only talks and doesn't act, the more logically he explains the principles, the more his words and deeds are disconnected, and the more he exposes the laughable face of an intellectual whose theory and practice are inconsistent. The author grasps the character's characteristics, and in the end, even the "lazybones" who is proficient in great principles himself says that we should break through dead corners, eliminate stubborn fortresses, and strive for "four-without" in the whole area—a full house of red, which very powerfully illustrates that the principles of eliminating the Four Pests and paying attention to hygiene are absolutely correct, and that those who can talk but cannot act are ridiculous. The clever author handles his characters just like another meaning of "inviting the guest into the urn," with very skillful techniques.
    The programs are performed very realistically. When the troupe came to Beijing, they performed the street play "Don't Spit Everywhere" along the way, and the audience mistakenly thought it was really happening, and wanted to take the actor who was performing the spitting to the police station to reason with them.
    The actors are very competent. The men played by the girls, whether they are old farmers or workshop directors, have the same style as those I have seen in my hometown or in the Hangzhou silk reeling factory. The old grandma in "A Thousand Li in a Day" and the mother in "The Girl Who Can't Be Stopped" accurately portray the two old women in the Zhejiang countryside because the actors are very familiar with life, understand life, and have mastered the performance rules of Yue Opera.
    This time when I watched Yue Opera, I didn't need the help of subtitles, and I could hear every word clearly. The singing has the original local characteristics of Yue Opera, thick and simple, bright and fresh, and approachable.
    These programs naturally still have some rough edges, but they allow us to see the literary and art circles of Zhejiang and Hangzhou marching towards the lofty goal of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving politics. The Great Leap Forward of the authors and actors themselves should be the foundation for the excellent compilation and performance of these many programs that express the Great Leap Forward.

    看杭州市越剧团演出
    戴不凡
    杭州市越剧团抵京的前几天，我听说他们要来演除四害，演农村大跃进，……我想：越剧，能行么？
    看完了他们彩排的最后一个节目“一日千里”，我的心激动了。我觉得自己正像“一日千里”中那位八十七岁的老阿太，是按照老规矩来评论新事物，而这在今天已是不行的了。总的来说，我并没有发现他们的传统形式和新的生活内容有什么不和谐之处；相反，这些节目，朴素如同铅笔速写，精悍如同锋利的匕首，是那么活泼清新，充满着泥土气息！
    这些精彩的艺术作品，生活内容的丰富和新鲜，只有用江南此际的“雨后春笋”来比拟它们。在这里，我看到了家乡人民大跃进的激情。然而，这种跃进的气派决不是春笋生长的气势所能比拟的，那真像八月十八的海宁潮水一般！——写文章时窗外正在下着春雨，不由的想起苏曼殊“何时归看浙江潮”的诗句；然而，记忆中的钱江大潮，和我从舞台上感受到的钱江两岸人民跃进高潮比起来，又是显得多么微不足道啊！
    这些富于戏剧性的节目，写出了大跃进中的各色人物。这里有母亲关她不住，为修水库在年三十夜也越窗而出的姑娘；有为积肥而在大年初一不招待上门女婿的老丈人；有十分钟前是先进的，但休息了十分钟后却成为落后了的缫丝工长；有拿着扩声筒沿街劝人不要随地吐痰的天真可爱的红领巾；也有彻夜在写除四害报道，而苍蝇蚊子满屋的知识分子；……总之，看了这些形式悦目、内容簇新、不时使人发出轻松愉快笑声的节目，在真实丰富的生活感受中，会使你从心灵深处，生出一股前进再前进的力量！
    每个节目都生动地反映了昨天或者刚才还在继续产生着的事物。它们为党的政策作了很好的宣传；有的节目甚至把报纸的社论也采用进去了，然而，由于作者们都是从写人物出发的，所以一点也不显得生硬机械。“满堂红”中那个不讲卫生的人，他满口说的，几乎全是报纸社论上的话，头头是道，甚至于能“考”倒来帮助他大扫除的红领巾。但是，由于他只说不做，所以，他越是把道理讲得头头是道，便越显得他的言行脱节，越暴露这位大写除四害报道的人理论和实践不一致，这便越来越深地揭露了一位知识分子的可笑面貌。作者掌握了人物的特征，到最后，甚至连这位精通大道理的“懒虫”自己也说出应当攻破死角，消灭顽固堡垒，争取全区“四无”——满堂红时，这就非常有力地说明除四害讲卫生的道理是十分正确的，而能说不能行者是可笑的。聪明的作者处理他的人物，只是像另一种意义的“请君入瓮”，技巧非常到家。
    节目演出得很逼真。剧团来京时沿途演出街头剧“不要随地吐痰”，竟被观众们误为真的发生此事，要把那位表演随地吐痰者的演员，扭送到派出所评理去。
    演员很称职。女孩子们演的男人，无论是老农或工长，都是我在家乡或杭州缫丝厂中见过的那样风度。“一日千里”中的老阿太，“关不住的姑娘”中的母亲，由于演员们非常熟悉生活，理解生活，并且掌握了越剧的表演规律，准确的表现出了两位浙江农村的老妇人。
    这一回看越剧，我没有借字幕的帮助，字字听得清楚。唱腔有着越剧原来的地方特色，浑厚朴素，爽朗清新，平易近人。
    这些节目自然难免还有粗糙之处，但是，它们可以使我们看出浙江和杭州文艺界在向为工农兵服务、为政治服务的崇高目标进军。作者和演员们本身的大跃进，该是这次许多表现大跃进的节目编演得十分出色的基础。
