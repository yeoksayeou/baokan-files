Wells and Artesian Wells

Wells are the main irrigation facilities for farmland in northern China. Across the country, approximately ten million wells irrigate over a hundred million mu of farmland. These farmlands are mostly distributed in grain and cotton producing areas, where irrigation increases production by one to three times, and in some cases, up to ten times or more.

Many areas in China need well irrigation. Provinces in North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China, as well as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces and regions, all have a certain area of cultivated land that requires well irrigation. Some cities or mountainous areas far from rivers also need to dig wells to supply drinking water. In the approximately four billion mu of pastures in Inner Mongolia and the Northwest, livestock also need water supplied by wells.

There are many types of wells, mainly divided into two types in terms of construction and use: dug wells and tube wells. Dug wells, also called large wells, have a diameter of more than three feet and are relatively shallow. They have a small water output, with one well capable of irrigating thirty to fifty mu of land. The well shafts are constructed of brick, stone, or planks. Tube wells have a diameter of five to eight inches, or sometimes twelve inches. Tube wells are deeper and have a higher water output, with one well capable of irrigating three to five hundred mu. The tubes for tube wells can be made of wood, bamboo, iron, or tile.

The advantages of dug wells are that they are inexpensive, provide quick results, and are easy to construct. They can also use various water lifting tools to draw water. Tube wells are more complex to construct, more expensive, and require suitable pumping tools for use. Many places also dig tube wells underneath dug wells, which is called "cone well spring." It is currently an effective method widely used in various places to develop irrigation by using groundwater.

In addition, the karez wells in Xinjiang, as well as the intercepted subsurface flow and horizontal pipe wells in North China, are all facilities that extract groundwater in a horizontal direction.

Groundwater may not always be abundant, but with good well-digging methods, good wells can be dug even in places with little water. Conversely, if the well-digging method is poor, it is difficult to avoid digging a well with little water output even where groundwater is plentiful.

China has a history of using groundwater for irrigation for thousands of years, and farmers in various places have rich experience and have created many methods. In the recent two or three years of the water conservancy construction upsurge, many advanced well-digging methods have emerged. "56 Well-Digging Method," "Gravel-Filled Spring," and "Quick Disk Sinking Sand Well" are some of these methods.

In terms of well quality, they can be divided into "complete wells" and "incomplete wells." A "complete well" penetrates one or several sandy gravel aquifer layers and has the bottom of the well shaft or pipe reaching the impermeable clay layer.

An "incomplete well" is one where the well shaft or pipe only penetrates part of the aquifer layer, or although it passes through the aquifer layer, the lower end does not reach the clay layer. "Complete wells" allow water from the aquifer to easily seep in large quantities, ensuring water availability even during droughts. These wells are also more stable because the bottom does not sink. When digging a well, it is essential to pay attention to quality; it is wrong to consider a well finished as soon as water is seen.

There is a type of well that is different from ordinary wells. It does not require human or mechanical pumping; water can gush out of the ground on its own. This is what we commonly call an "artesian well." Why can the water in this type of well gush out? Simply put, it is because: rainwater falls to the ground, part flows into rivers and seas, part evaporates, and part seeps into the ground and is stored in porous gravel and sand layers. Water flows from high to low places. If, in the downstream underground, it encounters a barrier such as rock or clay, it cannot flow further and pressure builds up. In this case, the water in the well will flow out on its own. This situation shows that artesian wells are not man-made; they depend on the structure of the strata. There are many artesian wells in the suburbs of Beijing, the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains, the western section of the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong, the Weihe Plain in Shaanxi, near Hohhot in Inner Mongolia, the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong, and in provinces such as Xinjiang, Anhui, and Henan. The height of the water gushing from these artesian wells ranges from a few inches to a few feet. For example, there are several artesian wells in Zibo City, Shandong Province, that can spout four to five feet above the ground. The artesian wells in Hohhot can spout to water towers several dozen feet high. Before liberation, artesian wells in various places were mainly discovered accidentally by working people while digging wells. After liberation, many new artesian wells were discovered during hydrogeological surveys in various places. Most of these newly discovered artesian wells have been handed over to agricultural cooperatives for use.

Although artesian wells are convenient, wells should not be dug too densely in one area. When not in use, the water should be controlled with a switch to prevent the artesian well from flowing. If the above two points are not heeded, the height and flow rate of the water will be affected. (Ge Yinxuan)

### 井和自流井

    井和自流井
    井是我国北方农田灌溉的主要设施。在全国约有一千万眼井灌溉着上亿亩的农田。这些农田多分布在粮、棉产区，灌溉比不灌的能增产一到三倍，最高还有达十来倍的。
    我国需要井灌的地区很多，华北、西北、东北三个地区的各省和内蒙古、新疆、广东、福建等省区都有一定面积的耕地，需要打井灌溉。有些都市或山区离河远，也需要打井供应饮水。在内蒙古和西北地区约四十亿亩牧场上，牲畜饮水也需要由井供应。
    井的种类很多，从构造和使用上主要分为筒井、管井两种。筒井也叫大井，口径三尺多，打的较浅，出水量小，一个井能浇三、五十亩地，井筒用砖、石或板砌成。管井口径是五到八寸，有的十二寸。管井打的较深，出水多，一个井可浇三、五百亩。管井的管有：木管、竹管、铁管或瓦管。
    筒井的优点是费用少、收效快、施工简便，并能用各种提水工具汲水；管井施工技术较复杂，费用也较大，使用的时候要用适宜的抽水工具。也有很多地方在筒井底下又打管井的，这叫“锥井下泉”。它是目前各地广泛利用地下水发展灌溉事业的一个有效办法。
    此外，新疆的坎儿井，华北地区的截潜流和横管井等都是在横的方向吸取地下水的设施。
    地下水不见得都那么多，但是打井方法好，水少的地方也可以打出好井；打井方法不好，地下水多也难免打成出水少的井。
    我国利用地下水灌溉，已有几千年历史，各地农民在这方面的经验丰富，创造很多。在近二、三年水利建设高潮中，又出现不少先进的打井方法。“ 56打井法”、“填砾泉”、“快盘打流沙井”等就是这些方法中的几个。
    从井的质量上说，可分“完整井”和“不完整井”两种。穿过一个或几个沙砾层的含水层，把井筒或井管的底部落到不透水的粘土层上，是“完整井”。
    把井筒井管只深入含水层的一部分，或虽然通过含水层，但下端没有达到粘土层的井，就是“不完整井”。“完整井”可以使含水层的水便于大量渗入，遇到干旱，也有水用。这种井由于井底不沉也较坚固。打井一定要讲究质量，见水就算一眼是不对的。
    有一种井和一般井不一样，它不用人力、机械抽水，水就能喷出地面。这就是我们平常所说的“自流井”。这种井里的水，为什么能喷出来呢？简单地说，这是因为：雨水降到地面，一部分流入河、海，一部分蒸发，一部分渗入地下含蓄在有孔隙的砾石、沙层里。水是由高向低处流动的，如果在下游地下遇到岩层，粘土等阻挡，就流不下去而发生压力。井里的水，在这种情况下就会自流出来。这个情况说明，自流井不是人打出来，它决定于地层的构造。北京郊区、太行山东麓、山东胶济线西段、陕西渭河平原、内蒙古呼和浩特附近、广东雷州半岛和新疆、安徽、河南等省，都有不少自流井。这些自流井喷水的高度，从几寸到几尺。如山东淄博市有几处自流井可以喷出地面四到五尺。呼和浩特的自流井可以喷到几丈高的水塔上去。解放前，各地的自流井主要是劳动人民在打井当中偶然发现的。解放以后，各地在进行水文地质调查的时候，发现了许多新自流井。这些新发现的自流井，多数都交给农业社使用了。
    自流井虽然便利，但在一个地区不能打井过密。在不用水的，时候还要用开关控制，不叫自流井出水。不注意上面两点，它的喷出的高度和喷水量都会受到影响。（葛荫萱）
