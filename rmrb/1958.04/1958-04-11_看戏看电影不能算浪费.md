    Watching Plays and Movies Cannot Be Considered Wasteful
    Resident of Xinjekou, Nanjing, Tian Gaichun
    Since the Party put forward the call for building the country and managing households through diligence and frugality, this slogan has taken root in people's hearts. Thrift is glorious, and waste is shameful, which has formed a social atmosphere. Many people have arranged their family life and set out plans for managing households diligently and frugally. This is a very gratifying phenomenon.
    However, in making plans for managing households diligently and frugally, some people have included watching movies and plays in their frugality plans. Some people have changed from watching a play every half month to watching one every month. Some people have expressed their determination: to resolutely not watch them at all. Some places simply promote to the masses "watch fewer movies and fewer plays."
    I think this is wrong. Although watching movies and plays belongs to entertainment and rest; it is also education and learning. Today's plays and movies are powerful tools for carrying out socialist propaganda and education to the broad masses of people. Through it, our production enthusiasm will be even more encouraged and stimulated.
    Although watching movies and plays also costs a few ticket fees, we cannot only calculate the "economic cost" and not calculate the "political cost."
    We cannot call it a waste as long as money is spent. Of course, those play and movie fans who are blindly immersed in entertainment regardless of economic conditions and work are another matter.

### 看戏看电影不能算浪费

    看戏看电影不能算浪费
    南京市新街口居民　田改春
    自从党提出勤俭建国、勤俭持家的号召以来，这个口号已深入人心。节约光荣，浪费可耻，已形成了社会风气。有不少人已安排了家庭生活，订出了勤俭持家计划。这是一种非常可喜的气象。
    然而在订勤俭持家计划中，有人把看电影看戏也列入了节约计划之内。有的人将过去半月看一次戏改为一月看一次。有的人表示了决心：坚决一次也不看了。有些地方干脆向群众宣传“少看电影少看戏”。
    我认为这是不对的。看电影和戏虽属于娱乐和休息；但也是教育和学习。我们今天的戏和电影是向广大人民群众进行社会主义宣传教育的有力工具。通过它会更鼓舞和激发起我们的生产热情。
    看电影和戏虽然也要花几个票钱，但是，我们不能只算“经济账”，不算“政治账”。
    不能只要是一花钱就叫作浪费。当然不顾经济条件和不顾工作，而一味沉醉在玩乐中的戏迷和影迷们，那就又当别论了。
