　　Current Affairs Talk

　　Old Tree Sprouts New Branches

　　The People's Daily on March 31st, page 7, carried a small news item: A ginkgo tree in Lushan, Jiangxi, dating back to the Jin Dynasty, has sprouted new branches after artificial cultivation.

　　The opportunity to go to Lushan to admire this ancient tree is, after all, limited to a few; but this news can greatly encourage the people of the whole country. First, even a thousand-year-old tree can be made to sprout new branches, which is enough to prove that we have great ways and great hope in transforming nature. Second, given the vastness of our motherland's territory, the breadth of its area, and the abundance of its resources, what can be transformed from useless to useful is not just this ancient tree alone?

　　Some people say: This event also symbolizes the great leap forward of our country with a long history in the socialist era. This is a further step, belonging to the poet's imagination.

　　"Symbolic" Picture

　　The wreckage of an American-made Chiang Kai-shek plane that was "not handed over to the Chinese Kuomintang Air Force" has finally been salvaged from the sea by us. The picture is published in the People's Daily on March 31st: the twisted fuselage still has half of the "White Sun" emblem, symbolizing the end of the American-Chiang family's reign, not only proving the bankruptcy of the aforementioned lie of the US Department of Defense, but also proving the bankruptcy of the American imperialists' "Two Chinas" daydream.

　　Attached are four lines of doggerel to mock it:

　　"Blue Sky" is not seen, "White Sun" is half gone, fuselage is broken, the American-Chiang alliance is bankrupt.

    时事小谈
    古树发新枝
    3月31日人民日报第七版中有一则小消息：江西庐山有一棵晋代的银杏，经过人工培养，已经重发新枝。
    有机会上庐山欣赏这棵千年古树的，毕竟是少数；但这消息却可以大大鼓舞全国人民。一、千年古树都可以使它重发新枝，这就足证我们改造自然是大有办法，大有希望的。二、以祖国疆土之大，幅员之广，物产之丰，可以化无用为有用的，岂仅仅是这一棵古树而已？
    有人说：这事也象征着我们的历史悠久的祖国在社会主义年代的大跃进。这就更进一步，属于诗人的想像了。
    “象征”图片
    “没有交给中国国民党空军”的美造蒋机残骸，终于被我们从海里打捞出来了。图片就登在3月31日人民日报上：扭曲的机身上还留有半个“白日”徽标，象征着美记蒋家天下的末日，不仅证明了美国国防部上述谎言的破产，也证明着美帝国主义“两个中国”的白日梦破产。
    兹附四句打油诗以嘲之：
    “青天”不见，“白日”少半，机身破烂，美蒋破产。
