    Using sodium alginate to size yarn instead of edible starch has recently been successfully tested at the Qingdao State-owned Seventh Cotton Textile Factory.
    Yarn sized with sodium alginate is both smooth and elastic, increasing the abrasion resistance and strength of the yarn. This reduces the breakage rate on looms by 48.4% compared to using pure starch, and also reduces the trash rate on looms by 28.7%.
    Sodium alginate is extracted from Sargassum seaweed found in shallow seas. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    用褐藻酸钠浆纱
    利用褐藻酸钠代替食用性淀粉浆纱的办法，最近在青岛国营第七棉纺织厂试验成功。
    褐藻酸钠浆出的纱既光滑又有弹性，增加纱的耐摩性和强力，使布机台时断头率比纯用淀粉时降低48.4％，布机落杂率也减少28.7％。
    褐藻酸钠是从浅海里的马尾藻中提炼出来的。　（据新华社讯）
