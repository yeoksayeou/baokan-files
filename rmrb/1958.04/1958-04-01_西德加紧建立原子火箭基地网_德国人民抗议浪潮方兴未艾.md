Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 30th -- According to TASS, the mass movement of residents from all walks of life in the German Democratic Republic against the arming of the West German Federal Defense Forces with atomic weapons is continuing to unfold. According to newspaper reports, working people in many cities of the Republic have successively held mass rallies to protest the atomic war preparations policy of the West German ruling clique. The mass rally in Magdeburg, attended by 100,000 people, was conducted under the slogan "Strive to Establish a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Europe." The rally held in Halle was also attended by approximately 100,000 people. In addition, rallies with thousands or over ten thousand participants were held in Eisleben (Halle District), Senftenberg (Cottbus District), and Sonneberg (Suhl District) and other places, protesting West Germany's atomic war preparations policy.

The 18,000 workers of the "Buna Chemical Plant" in Halle, the construction workers of the "Schwarze Pumpe" chemical combine in Cottbus District, and the broad masses of employees from many other industrial enterprises in the German Democratic Republic have also successively written letters to the leading organs of the West German Trade Union Federation, suggesting that West German trade unions, together with the trade unions of the German Democratic Republic, resolutely oppose atomic death.

The scientists of the "Scientific Committee for Peaceful Utilization of Atomic Energy," which is directly under the leadership of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic, issued a statement, expressing support for West German scientists who are opposed to the atomic threat.

Professors and lecturers from the University of Leipzig have also issued a statement to West German universities, condemning the recent resolution passed by the Federal Parliament on the issue of atomic armament, and calling on colleagues in West German universities to take protest actions.

Xinhua News Agency, March 31st -- Berlin Dispatch: According to the "Neues Deutschland" newspaper, following the Federal Parliament's forceful passage of the atomic armament resolution against the will of the people, the West German Ministry of Defense immediately issued an order to accelerate the establishment of West Germany's atomic rocket base network.

The Rhineland-Palatinate is the central area of Bonn's planned rocket base network. Seventeen bases are scheduled to be established there. Rocket launch pads will also be established in Bavaria, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, and Baden-Württemberg.

The "Neues Deutschland" quoted official news from the headquarters of the U.S. Army in West Germany stating that the American rocket installations in Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, and Baden-Württemberg are now fully operational. They are equipped with "Nike" rockets.

In addition, sources say that courses to train West German troops in the use of "tactical" atomic weapons will formally begin in the coming weeks. A portion of West German officers and soldiers are currently undergoing training in the United States. It is revealed that in addition to the "Matador" rockets personally ordered by Strauss in the United States, the West German army will also obtain various rockets from the United States with different ranges, such as "Honest John," "Corporal," and "Redstone." It is said that at least ten thousand specially trained soldiers will be needed to operate these weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, March 30th -- According to Deutsche Presse-Agentur on March 29th, a mass rally attended by more than ten thousand people was held in Hamburg on the 28th to oppose West Germany's implementation of atomic armament. The slogan of the meeting was: "No atomic weapons -- launch a struggle against atomic death!"

This is the third mass rally held by the West German people in the past week against atomic armament, following the Frankfurt conference and the Hanover conference.

The rally was initiated by the Hamburg organization of the Social Democratic Party.

West German Social Democratic Party member of parliament and former Minister of the Interior, Mr. Heinemann, demanded the resignation of the Adenauer government at the meeting, and also called for a referendum on the issue of atomic armament. He expressed support for the plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. During the meeting, the masses repeatedly shouted slogans demanding a general strike against atomic armament.

Currently, the slogan of holding a general strike is gaining increasingly widespread support in West Germany. More than four million West German trade union members have already passed resolutions at various rallies demanding a general strike to protest atomic armament.

At the same time, one hundred and fifty people from West Germany's cultural and scientific circles jointly issued a statement protesting the arming of West Germany with atomic weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 29th -- The second largest opposition party in West Germany, the Free Democratic Party, held its ninth congress in Düsseldorf on the 28th and 29th.

During the two-day conference, the attending representatives spoke enthusiastically, unanimously expressing opposition to the Adenauer government's atomic armament policy, expressing support for convening an East-West summit meeting and establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and opposing the establishment of American missile launch bases in West Germany.

    西德加紧建立原子火箭基地网
    德国人民抗议浪潮方兴未艾
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社柏林30日讯：民主德国各阶层居民反对用原子武器武装西德联邦国防军的群众运动正在继续展开。据报纸报道，共和国许多城市的劳动人民都先后举行群众大会，抗议西德统治集团的原子备战政策。马格德堡市有十万人参加的群众大会是在“争取建立欧洲无原子武器区”的口号下进行的。哈雷举行的大会也有约十万人参加。此外，艾斯列滨（哈雷专区）、森夫滕堡（科特布斯专区）和桑纳堡（苏尔专区）等地都举行了有数千人或一万多人参加的大会，抗议西德的原子备战政策。
    哈雷“布纳化学工厂”的一万八千名工人、科特布斯专区“黑色帮浦”化学联合厂的建筑工人和德意志民主共和国其他许多工业企业的广大职工也都纷纷写信给西德工会联合会领导机构，建议西德工会同民主德国工会一起，坚决反对原子死亡。
    直属民主德国部长会议领导的“和平利用原子能科学委员会”的科学家发表了一项声明，声援反对原子威胁的西德科学家。
    来比锡大学的教授和讲师也发表了一项致西德各大学的声明，其中谴责联邦议院最近就原子军备问题所通过的决议，并且号召西德大学里的同事采取抗议行动。
    新华社31日讯　柏林消息：据“新德意志报”报道，在联邦议院违反民意强行通过原子武装的决议之后，西德国防部立即发布命令，加速建立西德的原子火箭基地网。
    莱因兰—法尔茨州是波恩计划中的火箭基地网的中心区。那里预定建立十七个基地。在巴伐利亚州、黑森州、北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州、石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因州和巴登—瓦登堡州，也将建立火箭发射台。
    “新德意志报”引证了西德美军总司令部的官方消息说，莱因兰—法尔茨州、黑森州和巴登—瓦登堡州的美国火箭装置现在已经完全进入战斗状态。它们是以“奈克”式火箭装备起来的。
    另外，有消息说，训练西德军队使用“战术”原子武器的课程即将在最近数周内正式开始。目前已经有一部分西德官兵在美国受训。据透露，除了施特劳斯亲自在美国订购的“斗牛士”式火箭外，西德军队还将从美国获得“诚实约翰”式、“下士”和“红石”式等各种射程长短不等的火箭。消息说，预计将至少需要一万名受过专门训练的士兵来操纵这些武器。
    据新华社30日讯　据德意志通讯社29日讯：汉堡28日举行了有一万多人参加的反对西德实行原子武装的群众集会，会议的口号是：“不要原子武器——展开斗争反对原子死亡！”
    这是最近一周中西德人民继法兰克福大会和汉诺威大会以后举行的第三次反对原子武装的群众集会。　
    这次集会是由社会民主党汉堡组织发起的。
    西德社会民主党议员、前内政部长海?曼在会上要求阿登纳政府下台，同时号召就原子武装问题举行公民投票。他表示支持在中欧建立无原子武器区的计划。在会议进行过程中，群众一再高呼口号，要求举行反对原子武装的总罢工。
    目前，举行总罢工的口号在西德得到日益广泛的支持。四百多万西德工会会员已经在各种集会上通过了要求举行抗议原子武装的总罢工的决议。
    同时，西德一百五十名文化科学界人士联合发表了声明，抗议用原子武器武装西德。
    据新华社柏林29日电　西德第二大反对党自由民主党28日和29日在杜塞尔多夫举行第九次代表大会。
    在两天的会议中，到会的代表们热烈发言，一致表示反对阿登纳政府的原子武装政策，表示支持召开东西方最高级会议和建立中欧无原子武器区，反对在西德建立美国导弹发射基地。（附图片）
