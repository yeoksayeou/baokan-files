    Forever Be Revolutionary Fighters Building Socialism
    Over 38,000 Demobilized and Transferred Military Personnel in Beijing Hold Leap Forward Conference

    Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: Over 38,000 demobilized and transferred military personnel in Beijing held a socialist Leap Forward conference today at the Temple of Agriculture Stadium. They pledged to join the city's more than 100,000 demobilized and transferred military personnel in maintaining the People's Liberation Army's glorious tradition of not taking credit, not being arrogant, not fearing difficulties, and not fearing dangers, and to forever be steadfast socialist revolutionary fighters.

    Zhang Youyu, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Deputy Mayor of Beijing, praised the demobilized and transferred military personnel on all fronts at the meeting. He called on the demobilized and transferred military personnel to study their professions, learn science and technology, and dare to think, dare to act, and dare to be original in their current positions, in order to achieve a leap forward.

    Many representatives of demobilized and transferred military personnel reported on their achievements and experiences at the meeting. Wang Rong, a Beijing municipal agricultural labor model, head of the pig farm of the Xishan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haidian District, and a disabled veteran, said that he, a people's fighter who grew up under the education and cultivation of the Party, had only one hand, but he had also learned to plow, hoe, and drive a cart.

    Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs, and General Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, attended the meeting to congratulate them and gave speeches. In his speech, Xie Juezai expressed the hope that the more than 100,000 demobilized and transferred military personnel in Beijing and the demobilized and transferred military personnel across the country would join hands with the people of the whole country, share weal and woe, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again in the great cause of building socialism. General Xiao Hua put forward three requirements: always listen to the Party, be both red and expert, maintain close ties with the masses, humbly learn from the masses, and work hard and be honest in performing official duties. He hoped that all demobilized and transferred military personnel would forever be revolutionary fighters building socialism. Zhang Aiping, Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, read out the congratulatory letter from Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai to the conference.

    The conference also adopted a letter of determination to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. (Attached picture)
