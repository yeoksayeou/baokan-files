Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: The Ministry of Chemical Industry's Basic Construction Conference, which concluded today, decided to adopt several measures to accelerate the speed of construction, enabling the six large-scale fertilizer plants under construction or expansion to be put into production half a year to a year and a half ahead of schedule. Other pharmaceutical, organic chemical, and basic chemical plants will also be completed two months to a year ahead of schedule.

During the thirteen-day conference, representatives from various factories and mines, in the spirit of rectification, studied specific measures to accelerate the speed of construction and determined specific fighting targets. According to the targets proposed by various units: Taiyuan Fertilizer Plant will be completed in a year and a half, one year ahead of the original plan, and will be able to officially produce ammonium nitrate on National Day next year. The second phase of the Jilin Chemical Industry Company's project to produce 270,000 tons of synthetic ammonia annually will also be completed one year ahead of schedule on National Day next year. The Sichuan Fertilizer Plant, originally scheduled to be completed by the end of next year, can be completed half a year ahead of schedule. The Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant, which started construction later, can be put into production in October this year, a year and a half ahead of the original plan. It is estimated that the six large-scale fertilizer plants can supply several million tons of chemical fertilizer ahead of schedule, supporting the great leap forward in agriculture.

The conference decided to adopt measures to mutually adjust and promote the use of conserved and substitute materials to overcome the difficulties in the supply of materials and equipment. According to estimates, the total number of materials allocated by the state this year and accumulated by various units can meet the needs of accelerating the speed of construction. Jilin Chemical Industry Company decided to take out more than 800 tons of surplus steel to support fraternal units, and Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant decided to support Jilin Fertilizer Plant with sixteen oxidation furnaces. Many units also decided to use substitute materials to overcome the shortage of special materials. For example, the absorption tower of the ammonium nitrate workshop of Jilin Fertilizer Plant decided to use acid-resistant granite instead of stainless steel for construction, which can save 600 tons of stainless steel. Some enterprises, based on several years of production experience, are also preparing to use some carbon steel instead of special steel to manufacture high-pressure pipelines.

The conference also made arrangements to speed up the progress of design and construction. Design units are prepared to start from simplifying design procedures and strengthening collaboration, and increase design efficiency by four times. In terms of construction, they are prepared to further promote the rapid construction methods that were effectively implemented during the construction of the Jilin Chemical Plant, such as the three-dimensional cross-parallel flow construction method, the overall hoisting method, and the mixed group construction method, and to use more prefabricated components and accessories on the principle of economy.

In the competition conditions put forward by many units at the meeting, they all proposed to ensure that the project quality reaches excellent grade. According to the measures proposed by the design and construction units to save the use of funds, it is estimated that a nitrogen fertilizer plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons of synthetic ammonia can be built this year without increasing national investment.

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: A small nitrogen fertilizer plant broke ground today in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. This experimental factory with a demonstration nature is being built by the Ministry of Chemical Industry to gain experience in building small nitrogen fertilizer plants so that it can be widely promoted throughout the country.

This factory with an annual output of 48,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer consists of two small factories. One is suitable for special districts to run, with an annual output of 40,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer and an investment of 10 million yuan; the other is suitable for counties to run, with an annual output of 8,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer and an investment of 2.5 million yuan. The technical design and construction requirements of the entire factory are relatively simple, and it is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

Through the construction of this factory, the Ministry of Chemical Industry will further test and revise the design of small nitrogen fertilizer plants in order to obtain a complete set of standardized designs for various regions to adopt. Engineering and technical personnel and skilled workers, which are particularly lacking in various regions when building fertilizer plants, will also be trained here. At present, more than 20 provinces and cities across the country have decided to send a group of engineering and technical personnel and technicians to participate in the construction.

The leading organs of Beijing Municipality have given strong support to this measure of the Ministry of Chemical Industry. In addition to a group of backbone personnel drawn from the Ministry of Chemical Industry and personnel sent from various places to study, the remaining construction and installation forces will be supported by Beijing Municipality.

    化工部是实干部
    抓措施六个大型化肥厂将提前建成
    抓典型示范性小氮肥厂在北京动工
    据新华社1日讯　今天闭幕的化学工业部基本建设会议，决定采取几项加速建设速度的措施，使正在新建、扩建中的六个大型肥料厂分别提前半年到一年半投入生产。其他一些制药、有机化学和基本化学工厂也将提前两个月到一年建成。
    在为期十三天的会议上，各厂矿代表以整风的精神研究了加快建设速度的具体措施，并且确定了具体的奋斗指标。根据各单位提出的指标：太原肥料厂将在一年半时间内建成，比原计划提前一年，在明年国庆节就可以正式生产硝铵。吉林化学工业公司年产二十七万吨合成氨的第二期工程，也将提前一年在明年国庆节完成。原定明年年底完工的四川肥料厂可以提前半年。开工较晚的兰州肥料厂在今年10月就可以投入生产，比原计划提前一年半。预计六个大型肥料厂可以提前供应几百万吨化学肥料，支援农业大跃进。
    会议决定采取互相调剂和推广节约代用材料的措施，克服材料和设备供应中的困难。根据估算，今年国家调拨的和各单位积存的材料总数，可以满足加快建设速度的需要。吉林化学工业公司决定将八百吨多余钢材拿出来支援兄弟单位，兰州肥料厂决定将十六台氧化炉支援吉林肥料厂。许多单位还决定采用代用材料来克服特殊材料不足的困难。如吉林肥料厂硝铵车间的吸收塔，决定全部用耐酸花岗石代替不锈钢建造，可以节省六百吨的不锈钢。有的企业根据几年的生产经验，还准备用一部分炭素钢代替特殊钢制造高压管线。
    会议对加快设计和施工的进度，也作了安排。设计单位准备从简化设计手续、加强协作等方面着手，将设计效率提高四倍。施工方面准备进一步推行在吉林化工厂建设期间行之有效的快速施工法，如立体交叉平行流水施工法、整体吊装法、混合小组施工法等，并在节约的原则下多用预制构件、配件。
    许多单位在会议上提出的竞赛条件中，都提出要保证工程质量达到优等。根据设计、施工单位所提出的节约使用资金的措施估算，今年可以不增加国家投资，多建设一个半年产五万吨合成氨的氮肥厂。
    据新华社1日讯　一座小型氮肥厂今天在北京东郊破土动工。这个带有示范性质的实验工厂，是化学工业部为了取得建设小型氮肥厂的经验以便在全国普遍推广而建设的。
    这座年产四万八千吨氮肥的工厂由两个小厂组成。一个是适合于专区举办的，年产氮肥四万吨，投资一千万元；一个是适合于县举办的，年产氮肥八千吨，投资二百五十万元。整个工厂的技术设计和施工要求都比较简单，预计在今年底就可以建成。
    通过这座工厂的建设，化工部将进一步检验和修正小型氮肥厂的设计，以便得出一套完整的定型设计供各地采用。各地在建设肥料厂时，特别感到缺乏的工程技术人员和技术工人，也将由这里培养。目前全国二十多个省市都决定派一批工程技术人员和技工前来参加建设。
    北京市的领导机关对化工部这一措施给予了大力支持。除化工部抽调的一批建厂骨干和各地派来学习的人员以外，其余建筑安装力量将由北京市支援。
