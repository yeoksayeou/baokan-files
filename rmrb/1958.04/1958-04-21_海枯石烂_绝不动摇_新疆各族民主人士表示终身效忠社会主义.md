Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 20th - Over two thousand democratic figures and intellectuals from all ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region held a Great Leap Forward Rally for Socialist Self-Remolding in Urumqi City on the 19th.

The central content of self-remolding is: to open one's heart to the Party and the people, to transform one's bourgeois political and ideological stance, and to dedicate oneself to the socialist cause for life. They also expressed that "seas may dry up and rocks may crumble, but our resolve will never waver." Non-Party figures from the fields of science and technology, culture and education, medicine and health, industry and commerce, and religion who participated in the meeting received bursts of applause while speaking. Uraz Bayalin (Uyghur), Vice Chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region's CPPCC, expressed a warm welcome to the self-remolding Great Leap Forward plans of all ethnic groups. He gave a brief exposition on the necessity of remolding, what to remold, and how to remold, and demanded that all ethnic groups take opposition to local nationalism and the safeguarding of the unity of all ethnic groups and the unification of the motherland as the main content.

After the meeting, a procession of over two thousand people paraded with gongs and drums. The most eye-catching group in the procession was the large contingent of over four hundred people composed of imams and Islamic figures from fifty-five mosques in the city, who shouted slogans such as "Long Live the Communist Party" and "Take the Socialist Road." This was the largest number of them to participate in political activities in over eight years since liberation; almost all religious elders, over seventy years old and with graying hair, came to participate in the meeting with the aid of canes. In order to welcome the Great Leap Forward Rally for Self-Remolding, they actively participated in political study during the nearly month-long Ramadan period and planted trees with the citizens.

The procession marched to the gate of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, where the presidium of the meeting presented "letters of determination" and red hearts made of red cloth and red paper to Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, and Saifuddin, Secretary. In their speeches, Wang Enmao and Saifuddin encouraged and instructed the democratic figures and intellectuals of all ethnic groups.

    海枯石烂　绝不动摇
    新疆各族民主人士表示终身效忠社会主义
    新华社乌鲁木齐20日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各族各界民主人士和知识分子两千多人，19日在乌鲁木齐市举行社会主义自我改造跃进大会。
    自我改造的中心内容是：向党、向人民交心，改造资产阶级政治思想立场，终身效忠于社会主义事业。他们并表示“海枯石烂，绝不动摇”。参加大会的非党科学技术、文化教育、医药卫生、工商业和宗教界人士在会上发言时，掌声此起彼落。自治区政协副主席禹占林（回族）在讲话中，对于各族各界自我改造跃进计划表示热烈欢迎。他就改造的必要性、改造什么、怎样改造作了简要的阐述，并要求各族各界把反对地方民族主义，维护各族人民的团结和祖国的统一作为主要内容。
    会后，两千多人的队伍敲锣打鼓地举行了游行。游行队伍中，最受人注意的是市区五十五个清真寺阿訇和伊斯兰教人士组成的四百多人的大队，他们高呼着“共产党万岁”和“走社会主义道路”的口号。这是解放八年多以来他们参加政治活动人数最多的一次，几乎所有年过古稀、鬓发苍苍的宗教长者，都扶着拐杖来参加大会。他们为了迎接自我改造跃进大会，在近一个月封斋期间，积极参加了政治学习，并和市民一起植树造林。
    游行队伍走到了中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会门口，大会主席团向自治区党委第一书记王恩茂和书记赛福鼎献了“决心书”和用红布、红纸做成的红心。王恩茂和赛福鼎在讲话中，对各族各界民主人士和知识分子作了勉励和指示。
