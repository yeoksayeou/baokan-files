Liaoning Province's female workers are actively studying technology, reforming tools, and improving production efficiency and product quality. Wei Fengying, a female lathe operator at the state-owned Northeast Machine Manufacturing Plant, a model worker in Shenyang, and a national activist in socialist construction, innovated a "multi-tool," increasing the daily output of bearing processing from 800 to 12,000. In this way, she can complete the workload of the Second Five-Year Plan in four months. Among the fourteen members of the anchor chain punching group at the Dalian Shipyard, eleven are mothers. They completed the tasks of the First Five-Year Plan one year and eleven months ahead of schedule and are now engaged in the production of 1959.

    本报讯　辽宁省女职工积极钻研技术，改革工具，提高生产效率和产品质量。国营东北机器制造厂女车工、沈阳市劳动模范、全国社会主义建设积极分子尉凤英，革新了“多刀工具”，使加工轴承由日产八百个，提高到一万二千个。这样，她四个月就能完成第二个五年计划工作量。大连造船公司锚链冲环小组十四人中有十一名是孩子妈妈，她们提前一年又十一个月完成了第一个五年计划任务。现在正从事1959年的生产。
