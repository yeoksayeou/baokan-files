    "Qihong" Enters the Market Early
    This year, China's famous tea "Qihong" entered the market early. The 50,000 jin of black tea purchased by the state from the 11th to the 19th is of very good quality, with uniform leaves and even tenderness. Special grade tea accounts for more than 90%.

    “祁红”提早上市
    我国名茶“祁红”今年提早上市。国家从11日到19日收购的五万斤红茶，质量很好，叶片匀净，嫩度均匀，特级茶占90％以上。
