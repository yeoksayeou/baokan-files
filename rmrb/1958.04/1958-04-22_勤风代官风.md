    Diligence Replaces Bureaucracy
    Fan Lisheng
    Since the rectification campaign last year, many new trends have emerged in society. One example is the increase in cadres carrying manure baskets in Kaiyuan County, Liaoning Province. On the afternoon of March 25th, I went to the Kaiyuan County Party Committee to handle some matters and saw five or six manure baskets filled with horse manure placed under the Organization Department's small building. I casually asked a comrade about it, and he said that these were brought by township cadres when they came to the county to handle matters, picking them up along the way. This is truly killing two birds with one stone!
    Such things were rare, or even non-existent, in the past. However, after the great rectification movement, people's thinking has changed, and labor is gradually being regarded as glorious. Therefore, such ordinary labor has gradually been combined with work. In this way, diligence and thrift will naturally become a trend, and bureaucratic airs will naturally be eliminated, because cadres have become ordinary laborers, just like ordinary people carrying manure baskets.

    勤风代官风
    范力生
    从去年整风以来社会上出现了不少新风气。辽宁省开原县街上多了背粪筐的干部便是一例。3月25日下午我到开原县委去办事情，看到在组织部的小楼下放着五、六个粪筐，里边有马粪。我顺便问了一个同志，他说，这是乡干部来县里办事情时路上捎代拾的。这真是一举两得！
    这样的事情，过去是少见的，甚至是没有的。可是经过伟大的整风运动以后，人们的思想变化了，劳动渐渐地被人们认为是光荣的了，因而这样平常的劳动就被人们逐渐的和工作结合起来了。这样一来，勤俭自可成风，而官风骄气自然会取消，因为当干部的已经和普通背粪筐的人一样，都成为普通的劳动者了。
