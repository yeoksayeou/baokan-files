Xinhua News Agency, April 1st dispatch from Tokyo: It is reported from Tokyo that Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi has written a letter to Chiang Kai-shek, assuring him that the Japanese government adheres to its policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, and is prepared to undermine the implementation of the recently signed Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

Kishi Nobusuke wrote this letter to curry favor with the Chiang Kai-shek clique under the patronage of the United States, and to "appease" the annoyance and embarrassment felt by the Chiang Kai-shek clique over the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Kishi Nobusuke's letter was brought to Taipei on March 30 by the Japanese "Ambassador" to Taipei, Kenkichi Horiuchi. According to Japan's Kyodo News Agency, Kishi Nobusuke stated in his letter to Chiang Kai-shek that the Japanese government has no intention of recognizing China, nor does it intend to recognize the right of the Chinese commercial representative office in Japan to fly the national flag. The Japanese government "strongly hopes" to maintain "friendly relations" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Kyodo News Agency also revealed that Horiuchi will "explain" to Chiang Kai-shek that Article 92 of the Japanese Criminal Law, which stipulates that acts of damaging foreign national flags will be punished, is not applicable to China. That is to say, the Japanese government will condone acts that insult the dignity of the Chinese national flag.

Kishi Nobusuke's letter thoroughly exposes his face of hostility towards the Chinese people. Kishi Nobusuke has consistently adopted a negative and obstructive attitude towards restoring normal Sino-Japanese relations and developing Sino-Japanese trade. Even before the Japanese trade delegation to China set off to Beijing to sign the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement last November, the Japanese government constantly exerted pressure on the delegation, attempting to revise the draft trade agreement and memorandum that had already been unanimously approved by both China and Japan, especially the provisions regarding the right of the Chinese commercial representative office to fly the national flag and guaranteeing the safety and convenience of the commercial representative office and its personnel in carrying out their work. After the trade agreement was formally signed, although the Japanese public and the three Japanese organizations that signed the agreement repeatedly requested the Japanese government to approve the agreement, the Japanese government was slow to express a definite attitude. Some stubborn elements within the ruling Japanese party also deliberately adopted a difficult and destructive attitude. The Foreign Affairs Investigation Committee of the Liberal Democratic Party, headed by Hitoshi Ashida and Yakichiro Suma, has repeatedly spread opposition to the memorandum and the right of the Chinese commercial representative office to fly the national flag.

After the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, the Chiang Kai-shek clique immediately issued clamors and took threatening measures, "protesting" the agreement, especially the provision regarding the right of the Chinese commercial representative office to fly the national flag. During this period, the United States was actively involved between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, exerting pressure on the Japanese government under the guise of "mediating" the Japan-Chiang "dispute." An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on March 28 revealed that the United States had "informally but very strongly" expressed to Taipei and Tokyo its "concern" about the Chinese commercial representative office's right to fly the national flag. The message also threatened that if Japan and Chiang "break," it would cause "anti-Japanese sentiment" in the United States. Now, Kishi Nobusuke is acting entirely according to the dictates of the United States.

Contrary to the unfriendly attitude of the Japanese government, the Chinese government has always adopted a positive and supportive attitude towards the Japanese people's desire to restore normal Sino-Japanese relations and develop Sino-Japanese trade. After the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi, when meeting with Kumao Yamamoto, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and Saburo Nango, Chairman of the Japan-China Export-Import Association, on March 7, welcomed the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and pointed out that "this agreement is an economic trade agreement from an economic point of view, and a friendly agreement from a political point of view, and it is a bridge for developing friendship between the people of the two countries."

Kishi Nobusuke's attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people completely violates the Japanese people's ardent desire to have friendly exchanges and economic exchanges with the Chinese people. After the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, Japanese public opinion and the public expressed their welcome and demanded that the Japanese government approve the agreement. The Japanese Socialist Party demanded on March 6 that the Japanese government quickly approve the agreement and stated that it would do its utmost to implement it. Especially the Japanese economic circles, at a time when Japan's economic recession is being aggravated by the impact of the American economic recession, place great hope on the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Under such circumstances, even Kishi Nobusuke himself had to say when answering questions at the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on March 25 that he wanted to "support and assist" the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement "as much as possible." However, his letter to Chiang Kai-shek has proven the falsity of these words and completely exposed his double-dealing tactics.

### 岸信介坚持与中国人民为敌  不惜破坏中日贸易协定讨好蒋介石集团

    岸信介坚持与中国人民为敌
    不惜破坏中日贸易协定讨好蒋介石集团
    新华社1日讯　据来自东京的消息透露，日本首相岸信介已经写信向蒋介石保证，日本政府坚持与中华人民共和国和中国人民为敌的政策，并且准备破坏最近签订的第四次中日贸易协定的实施。
    岸信介写这封信的目的，是为了讨好美国卵翼下的蒋介石集团，“抚慰”蒋介石集团对第四次中日贸易协定的签订所感到的恼怒和难堪。岸信介的信已经由日本驻台北“大使”堀内谦介在3月30日带到台北。据日本共同社透露，岸信介在他的信中向蒋介石表明，日本政府无意承认中国，也无意承认驻在日本的中国商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗，日本政府“强烈希望”同蒋介石集团维持“友好关系”。共同社还透露，堀内将向蒋介石“解释”，日本刑法第九十二条关于对损毁外国国旗的行为将加以处罚的规定，对中国是不适用的。这就是说，日本政府将放纵污辱中国国旗尊严的行为。
    岸信介的信彻底地暴露出他敌视中国人民的面貌。岸信介一贯对恢复中日正常关系和发展中日贸易采取消极和阻挠的态度。甚至在去年11月日本访华通商使节团动身来北京签订第四次中日贸易协定以前，日本政府就不断地对使节团施加压力，企图修改早经中日双方一致通过了的贸易协定草案和备忘录，特别是其中关于中国商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗和保证商务代表机构和它的人员的安全和进行工作的方便的规定。在贸易协定正式签订以后，虽然日本公众和签订协定的日本三个团体一再要求日本政府同意这个协定，日本政府却迟迟不表示肯定的态度。日本执政党内部的一部分顽固分子还有计划地采取刁难和破坏的态度。以芦田均和须磨弥吉郎为首的自由民主党外交调查会就一再对备忘录和中国商务代表机构悬挂国旗的权利散布反对论调。
    在第四次中日贸易协定签订以后，蒋介石集团立即发出叫嚣和采取威胁性的措施，“抗议”这个协定，特别是关于中国商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗的规定。在这期间，美国在日本和蒋介石集团之间活动频繁，以“调解”日蒋“纠纷”为名对日本政府施加压力。美联社3月28日华盛顿消息透露，美国已经“非正式地然而很强烈地”向台北和东京表明了美国对中国商务代表机构有权利悬挂国旗这件事的“忧虑”。消息并且说，美国官员希望，岸信介会避免同蒋介石“决裂”。消息威胁说，如果日蒋“决裂”，将会引起美国的“反日情绪”。现在，岸信介就正在看着美国的脸色办事。
    同日本政府的不友好态度相反，中国政府对日本人民要求恢复中日正常关系、要求发展中日贸易，一贯采取积极支持的态度。在第四次中日贸易协定签订以后，陈毅副总理兼外交部长在3月7日接见日本国际贸易促进协会会长山本熊一和日中输出入组合理事长南乡三郎的时候，曾经表示欢迎第四次中日贸易协定的签订，并且指出，“这个协定从经济上说是贸易协定，从政治上说是友好协定，是发展两国人民友谊的桥梁”。
    岸信介敌视中国人民的态度，完全违背了日本人民要求同中国人民友好往来和进行经济交流的热烈愿望。第四次中日贸易协定签订以后，日本舆论和公众纷纷表示欢迎，并且要求日本政府同意这个协定。日本社会党在3月6日要求日本政府迅速批准这个协定，并且表示将竭尽全力加以贯彻执行。特别是日本经济界，在日本的经济衰退受到美国经济衰退的影响而日益严重化的时候，对第四次中日贸易协定的实施寄予很大的希望。在这种情况下，甚至岸信介本人3月25日在日本众议院预算委员会上答复质询时也只好说，他想对第四次中日贸易协定“尽可能地加以支持和协助”。但是，他给蒋介石的信已经证明这番话的虚伪性，并且把他的两面手法完全暴露了出来。
