    "Chinese Arts and Crafts Album" to be Published in August
    In order to publicize the great achievements of China's arts and crafts industry and promote its development, the Arts and Crafts Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry has compiled a collection of works by artisans who attended the 1957 National Arts and Crafts Artisans Representatives Conference, as well as some gifts presented to foreign countries, and has compiled and printed a "Chinese Arts and Crafts Album." This album is divided into eight sections: state gifts (some of the valuable gifts presented to celebrate the October Revolution in the Soviet Union), ceramics, sculpture, embroidery, lacquerware, weaving, metal crafts, and others, concentrating the main essence of China's arts and crafts. Among them, there are more than 90 color plates and more than 170 black and white plates, each with a simple textual explanation, and typeset in Chinese, Russian, English, French, and Arabic. This album can serve as a major reference material for arts and crafts departments in various regions to understand the situation, and for researchers and designers and artisans engaged in arts and crafts variety research and design.
    It will be published by the People's Liberation Army Pictorial Publishing House in mid-August this year.
