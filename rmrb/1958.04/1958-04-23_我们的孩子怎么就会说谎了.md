How Did Our Children Learn to Lie?

　　In the evening, I wanted to turn on the desk lamp and read for a while. When I looked up, I noticed that the light green desk lamp on the table was broken. I immediately lost my temper.

　　I called Xin Xin and Hong Hong in front of me and began to interrogate them. Six-year-old Xin Xin insisted that the wind had blown the window open and knocked over the lamp. His tone was very certain, as if I should be questioning the wind and the window. Four-year-old Hong Hong told the truth. She said that her brother had been kicking a football in the room and knocked over the lamp. At this point, I could no longer contain the anger in my heart. I kept asking Xin Xin, "Why did you lie?" "Who taught you to lie?" Xin Xin was stunned by my questioning and burst into tears.

　　"Xin Xin lied." I was disturbed by this sudden problem.

　　My wife sat down beside me. She told me that Xin Xin had been lying a lot recently. Sometimes, when his younger sister asked him for candy, he would clap his hands and say, "Look! There's none left." But as soon as Hong Hong turned her head, he would take a piece of candy out of his pocket and quickly stuff it into his mouth. There were other lies as well, and the more I heard, the angrier I became. However, she was not satisfied with my attitude towards the children. She said, "You only know how to blame the children and lose your temper. Why don't you think about how the children's mistakes are caused?" These words touched me. I put down the book and fell into deep thought. I remembered some things that had happened in the past year or so.

　　Once, a neighbor's child, Xiao Hua, was showing off his toy to Xin Xin, saying, "Look! I have a little horse-drawn carriage that my dad bought me. You don't have one!"

　　"Humph! Who likes your broken carriage?" Although Xin Xin said this, it could be seen from his greedy eyes how much he wanted to have a little horse-drawn carriage himself! He repeatedly asked me to buy one too, and to avoid his pestering, I readily agreed. However, I was so busy with work afterwards that I completely forgot about buying the little horse-drawn carriage. When the child realized that I was not sincere about buying him the little horse-drawn carriage, he stopped mentioning it with disappointment. In this way, I unintentionally deceived the child for the first time.

　　Something like this also happened. One Sunday, we took Xin Xin to see a movie. Because Hong Hong was too young, we couldn't take her, but she cried and insisted on going. So I said, "We're not going to see a movie. We're taking Xin Xin to see a doctor and get a shot." Xin Xin looked at us with a strange look, then at the movie ticket in his hand. Then he suddenly realized, hid the movie ticket behind his back, and pretended to say, "We're going to get a shot!" He gestured to his buttocks with his hand. We were all amused by this funny scene, but we didn't realize that we were teaching the child to lie.

　　Grandma was overly doting on Xin Xin, and she always protected him when he made mistakes. Once, Xin Xin threw a tantrum at dinner and smashed the bowl on the ground, breaking a beautiful little porcelain bowl. Just as I walked into the room, Grandma kept trying to excuse the child, saying that she had accidentally knocked Xin Xin's bowl to the ground. Then, Xin Xin also followed suit and said, "I didn't break it. Grandma knocked my bowl off."

　　Usually, I treat my children too harshly, and I often use an impatient and rude attitude to deal with their mistakes. Therefore, sometimes when children do something wrong, they are afraid of being punished and dare not tell me the truth.

　　Thinking of this, I understood: it turns out that the child's bad habit of lying is caused by the adults' wrong educational methods. In front of children, adults' inconsistent words and deeds, deception, failure to keep promises, rude attitudes, etc., will make children become hypocritical and dishonest people.

　　Remember these lessons! From now on, treat children with a sincere attitude and establish a relationship of trust and friendship with them.

### 我们的孩子怎么就会说谎了

    我们的孩子怎么就会说谎了
    晚上，想打开台灯看一会儿书。一抬头，发现桌子上那只淡绿色的台灯被碰坏了，我立刻发起脾气来。
    我把新新和红红叫到面前，开始查问起来。六岁的新新一口咬定说是风吹开窗子，把台灯打翻了。他的口气非常肯定，好像我应该去责问风和窗子。四岁的红红说了实话。她说，是哥哥在屋里踢皮球把台灯碰坏的。这一来，我心头的怒火再也耐不住了。我连声追问新新：“为什么撒谎？”“谁教你说谎的？”……。新新被我问得目瞪口呆，放声大哭起来。
    “新新说谎了。”我被这个突如其来的问题搅得心烦意乱。
    妻子在我旁边坐下来。她告诉我，新新最近常常撒谎。有时，妹妹向他要糖吃，他把两手一拍说：“你看！没有了。”可是，红红刚一转脸，他就从口袋里掏出一块糖迅速地塞到自己嘴里去了。还有其他一些撒谎的事情，越听越令人生气。但是，她不满意我对待孩子的那种态度。她说：“你就知道责备孩子，发脾气，为什么不想想孩子的错误是怎样产生的？”这话触动了我。推开书，陷入沉思。我想起了最近一年多来发生的一些事情。
    有一次，邻家的小华拿着玩具，故意对新新炫耀说：“看呀！我有小马车，是爸爸买的，你就没有！”
    “哼！谁喜欢你那破马车。”新新虽然这么说，但从他那贪婪的目光里可以看出，他多么想自己也有一辆小马车啊！他一再要求我也买一辆，我为着避免他的纠缠，就满口答应了。可是，事后工作一忙，我把买小马车的事情忘得干干净净。当孩子感到我不是真心给他买小马车时，他怀着失望的心情再也不提这件事了。就这样，我在无意中第一次欺骗了孩子。
    还发生过这样的事情。星期天，我们带新新去看电影，因为红红年龄太小，不能带她，但她哭着偏要去。我就说：“哪里是去看电影啊，是带新新去看病、打针。”新新带着奇异的眼光看看我们，又看看手里拿的电影票，于是他恍然若悟，把电影票往背后一藏，也假装说：“我们打针去！”说着用手向屁股上比划了一下。我们都为这滑稽的场面逗笑了，却没有想到这是在教孩子说谎。
    奶奶对新新是过份溺爱的，新新犯了错误，奶奶总是袒护他。一次，吃饭时新新发脾气把碗摔在地上，一只漂亮的小磁碗打破了。正好我走进屋里，奶奶连声为孩子开脱，说是她不小心把新新的饭碗碰在地上。接着，新新也跟着说：“不是我打的，是奶奶把我的饭碗碰掉了。”
    平时，我对待孩子是过份严厉的，我常用急燥、粗暴的态度处理孩子的错误。因此，有时孩子做错了事情，怕受责罚，就不敢对我说实话。
    想到这里，我明白了：原来，孩子说谎的恶习，是由于大人错误的教育方法造成的。在孩子面前，大人的言行不一、哄骗、不信守诺言、态度粗暴等等，都会使孩子成为虚伪和不诚实的人。
    记取这些教训吧！从现在起，用真诚的态度对待孩子，和孩子建立起信任和友谊的关系。
