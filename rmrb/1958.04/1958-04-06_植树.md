    Tree Planting
    Gao Liang
    A tree in front of my house,
    Planted by the state, I take care of it,
    Watering diligently, constantly adding soil,
    In ten years, it grows as thick as an armful.
    In winter, it blocks wind and sand, in summer, it provides shade,
    The greening of the capital, everyone benefits. (Attached image)

    植树
    高粮
    我家门前一棵树，
    国家种植我照顾，
    勤浇水，常扶土，
    十年长它一搂粗。
    冬挡风沙夏乘凉，
    首都绿化都沾光。（附图片）
