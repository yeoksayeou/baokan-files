Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 5th: Youssef el-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Permanent Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council, said here on the 5th that the unity shown by the Asian-African people on "Support Algeria Day" proves to the imperialists that the Asian-African people are now a tremendous force that can deal with any imperialist threat and safeguard the cause of freedom and peace throughout the world.

Sibai also said that this unity also shattered the hopes of the imperialists and warmongers that the resolutions of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference would vanish into thin air.

In a statement to the press, Sibai spoke of the demonstrations and public gatherings protesting France's war in Algeria, which were held in all Asian-African countries participating in the Cairo conference on "Support Algeria Day." Sibai said that the Secretariat had been receiving a continuous stream of telegrams supporting the Algerian people. At the same time, the Secretariat has telegraphed the United Nations and all Asian-African countries, requesting them to mediate to resolve the Algerian issue and assist Algeria in restoring its independence and freedom.

    亚非人民团结力量巨大
    西巴伊对“声援阿尔及利亚日”的总结
    新华社开罗5日电　亚非人民团结理事会常设秘书处秘书长优素福·西巴伊5日在这里说，亚非人民在“声援阿尔及利亚日”所表示的团结一致，向帝国主义分子证明，现在亚非人民是一种巨大的力量，这种力量可以对付任何帝国主义威胁，并且能够维护全世界的自由与和平的事业。
    西巴伊又说，这种团结一致还打破了帝国主义分子和战争贩子们所抱的这种希望：亚非人民团结大会的决议将化为泡影。
    西巴伊在向报界发表的谈话中谈到了抗议法国在阿尔及利亚进行战争的示威和公众集会，这些示威和公众集会是在“声援阿尔及利亚日”在所有参加开罗会议的亚非国家举行的。西巴伊说，秘书处接连不断地收到了大批支持阿尔及利亚人民的电报。同时，秘书处已经打电报给联合国和所有亚非国家，要求它们进行斡旋来解决阿尔及利亚问题，并且协助阿尔及利亚恢复它的独立和自由。
