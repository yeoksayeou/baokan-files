    Qingdao Granite Can Be Used for Industrial Products
    In order to meet the demands of the Great Leap Forward in industrial production, the state-owned Qingdao Stonework Factory is shifting from producing building materials to producing industrial products. After repeated testing and trials in recent years, it has been proven that Qingdao granite has the characteristics of heat resistance, pressure resistance, acid resistance, and corrosion resistance, and can be used to make products such as dilute nitric acid absorption towers, mother liquor tanks, and acid-resistant tanks. The degree of acid resistance and service life exceed those of stainless steel and other acid-resistant materials by several times, and the cost is also cheaper. The supply range is most suitable for chemical fertilizer plants, pesticide plants, galvanizing plants, dyeing and weaving plants, and pharmaceutical factories. In order to fully meet the requirements of user units, our factory is now preparing to install electrical machinery and equipment to produce in large quantities and meet market needs.

    青岛花岗石可做工业用品
    国营青岛料石厂为了满足工业生产大跃进的要求，正由生产建筑材料转向生产工业用品。几年来经过多次化验及试用，证明青岛花岗石有抗热、抗压、耐酸、抗腐等特点，可以制作稀硝酸吸收塔、母液槽、耐酸槽等产品。耐酸程度及使用年限超出不锈钢及其他耐酸材料数倍，价值也便宜。供应范围以化学肥料厂、农药厂、镀锌厂、染织厂及制药厂等最为适宜。我厂为了充分满足使用单位的要求，现正筹备安装电力机械设备，以便大量生产，满足市场需要。
