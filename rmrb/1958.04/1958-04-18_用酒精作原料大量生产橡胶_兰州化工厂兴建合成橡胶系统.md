Lanzhou Chemical Plant to Build Synthetic Rubber System, Using Alcohol as Raw Material for Mass Production of Rubber

(Our newspaper reports) The main factory building of the first national project for large-scale production of synthetic rubber using alcohol as a raw material has commenced construction at the Lanzhou Chemical Plant. Once it is put into production, it will lay the foundation for the development of the organic synthetic industry and the high molecular compound industry in the country.

Synthetic rubber is still a new industry in the world. It has a wider range of uses than natural rubber and has broader applications in industrial construction. Moreover, the production of synthetic rubber is not restricted by climate or geographical location.

The rubber production system of the Lanzhou Chemical Plant mainly uses alcohol as raw material. In the future, the products to be produced will include not only synthetic rubber that replaces natural rubber, but also a variety of products and by-products such as oil-resistant rubber and plastics, which can be used as industrial raw materials. After the second phase of the plant is put into production, the waste gas from the Lanzhou Refinery will be used to produce alcohol, or directly into butadiene (the raw material for synthetic rubber), comprehensively utilizing petroleum resources.

All the civil engineering work for the main factory buildings of the rubber production system of the Lanzhou Chemical Plant will be completed this year, and some auxiliary workshops are planned to be tested and put into production next year. In order to train technical cadres, small-scale experimental work on synthetic rubber began on April 10.

    用酒精作原料大量生产橡胶
    兰州化工厂兴建合成橡胶系统
    本报讯　全国第一座用酒精大规模生产合成橡胶的主厂房，在兰州化工厂开工兴建。它投入生产后，就可以为全国发展有机合成工业和高分子化合物工业打下基础。
    合成橡胶在世界上还是一种新工业，比天然橡胶使用范围广，在工业建设上更有广泛的用途，而且制造合成橡胶不受气候、地理上的限制。
    兰州化工厂的橡胶生产系统，主要是利用酒精作原料，将来出厂的品种除去有代替天然橡胶的合成橡胶外，还有耐油橡胶和塑料等多种多样产品和副产品，可以做为工业上的原料。这个厂第二期工程投入生产后，又利用兰州炼油厂的废气作成酒精，或直接作成丁二烯（制成合成橡胶的原料），综合利用石油资源。
    兰州化工厂橡胶生产系统主要厂房的全部土建工程，要在今年内完工，部分辅助车间计划在明年试车生产。为了培训技术干部，合成橡胶的小型试验工作已于4月10日开始。
