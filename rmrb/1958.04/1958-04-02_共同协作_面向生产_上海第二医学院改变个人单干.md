Joint Collaboration, Production-Oriented
Shanghai Second Medical College Changes Individual Work Style

(Our report) The Second Medical College, after extensive debate among all teachers regarding scientific research, has clarified that scientific research must be jointly collaborative and production-oriented.

Although the college has achieved certain accomplishments in scientific research, serious individualistic pursuit of fame and gain existed among various teaching and research groups regarding scientific research and writing papers. Some individuals, to achieve this goal, were unwilling to cooperate with others, even resorting to monopolizing laboratories and harming others for personal gain. Of the thirty-six specific topics under the ten central themes that the national science plan required the college to research, the teaching and research groups had only researched or prepared to research one-third, while they had self-ordered ninety-seven topics that were not part of the national plan.

Targeting these bourgeois ideologies in scientific research, a debate was launched among all teachers. Most teachers in the chemistry teaching and research group emphasized the independence and integrity of their discipline, believing that research work should develop towards chemical theory and could not and should not serve medicine. The Academic Committee, in the ten-year plan, required the chemistry teaching and research group to focus on the "chemical identification and purification of Chinese medicine" in the future. The teaching and research group was even more dissatisfied with this, believing it was playing a supporting role and changing careers. After multiple debates and ideological clashes, many teachers' understanding improved, recognizing that the unwillingness to research Chinese medicine stemmed from the pursuit of "fame and gain." After establishing the idea of everything for socialism, the teachers in the chemistry teaching and research group were willing to cooperate with clinical teaching and research groups to conduct research work together. Through debate, most teachers in the medical and dental teaching and research groups advocated focusing on researching diseases that pose the greatest threat to people's health, opposing the mixing of individualism in scientific research.

In this debate, all teachers negated the capitalist research direction. Many teachers abandoned "working alone" and actively participated in "cooperation." Various teaching and research groups revised their original scientific research plans. They concentrated the strengths of all departments in the school to establish five special research groups for traditional Chinese medicine, schistosomiasis, cardiovascular, digestive system, and tuberculosis, determined to work together to do a good job in research; at the same time, seven central laboratories were established, open to all teachers, overcoming the shortcomings of decentralized management and non-interoperability in the past.

### 共同协作　面向生产  上海第二医学院改变个人单干

    共同协作　面向生产
    上海第二医学院改变个人单干
    本报讯　第二医学院在科学研究工作上经过全体教师大争大辩，明确了科学研究必须共同协作面向生产。
    该院在科学研究方面虽然有一定成就。但是，各教研组对科学研究、写论文等方面存在着严重的个人名利思想。有的人为达到这个目的，不愿意与别人合作，甚至有独霸实验室、损人利己的不良行为。国家科学规划中要求该院研究十个中心题目的三十六个具体题目，各教研组已经研究和准备研究的只占三分之一，而自订的、不属于国家规定的题目倒有九十七个。
    针对科学研究中这些资产阶级思想，在全体教师中展开了辩论。化学教研组的大部分教师都强调本门学科的独立性、完整性，认为研究工作应向化学理论方面发展，不可能也不应该为医学服务。学术委员会在十年规划中，要求化学教研组今后着重研究“中药的化学鉴定及提纯”，教研组对此更为不满，认为这是当配角，是改行。经过多次的辩论和思想交锋，不少教师认识有了提高，认为不愿意研究中药的思想根源，还是“名利”两字在作怪。在确立了一切为了社会主义的思想后，化学教研组的教师愿意配合临床各教研组一起搞研究工作。医疗系、口腔系教研组通过辩论，大多数教师都主张重点研究危害人民健康最大的疾病，反对在科学研究中掺杂个人主义思想。
    全体教师在这一场辩论中，否定了资本主义研究方向，许多教师放弃了“单干”，积极参加“合作”，各教研组修订了原来的科学研究规划。集中全校各方面的力量成立了中医中药、血吸虫病、心脏血管、消化系统、结核病五个专题研究小组，决心通力合作一致搞好研究工作；同时设立七个中心实验室，向全校教师开放，克服了过去分散管理、互不通用的缺点。
