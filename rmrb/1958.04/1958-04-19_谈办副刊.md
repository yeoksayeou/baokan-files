On Running a Supplement
Wei Wenbo

Running a supplement requires first considering for whom it is run, much like a chef preparing a dish must first consider for whom it is intended. Only by understanding the guests' tastes can one create dishes that suit them. The main readers of the "Morning Flowers" supplement are workers, peasants, and cadres. In recent years, the cultural level of workers has greatly improved, with most having at least upper primary or junior high school education. The cultural level of suburban peasants has also improved. Their needs should be met first. In addition, the needs of intellectuals should also be considered, as their needs and those of workers and peasants can be unified in many aspects. As long as something is closely related to life, reflects actual struggles, and is written vividly, workers, peasants, and cadres will enjoy reading it, and so will intellectuals.

The content and form of the "Morning Flowers" supplement should be diversified; this is crucial. Because there are thousands upon thousands of readers, with different backgrounds and preferences, just like guests eating dishes, some like sweet, sour, spicy, salty, bland, and one cannot force uniformity. One of the shortcomings of the "Morning Flowers" supplement of the Liberation Daily in the past was a lack of diversification, with monotonous content, rigid form, and always the same tone. In the future, in terms of content, we must first strengthen ideological guidance, reflect all aspects of current real life and struggles, and play a promoting role; this is the main thing. But this is not enough, just like hosting a dinner party, there must be both meat and vegetable dishes. Therefore, we must also publish useful articles on natural science knowledge, social life, common sense, and so on, to broaden people's horizons. There must be works of praise, as well as articles of criticism and satire. The aim is to promote socialism, not to hinder it, to play a positive role, not a negative one.

The form of the "Morning Flowers" supplement should also be diversified, with essays, novels, features, poems, biographies, and so on. Articles should be popular and concise, generally focusing on six or seven hundred words, with a maximum length of only about a thousand words. If articles are too long, the space on the page will be reduced, the supplement will not be diversified, and fewer people will read it.

We must run the supplement with an open door. We must not only find writers and experts to write, but especially find workers and peasants who can write, speak, and sing to contribute. Editors must put down their airs and go to the masses to solicit and write articles, so that editors and readers are combined. To run a supplement that the masses love, the staff must first be able to approach the masses, understand the masses, and share their joys and sorrows. This is a matter of workers' and peasants' feelings, and it is also the fundamental issue in running a good supplement.

[Editor's Note: This is an article written by Comrade Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, for the "Morning Flowers" supplement of the Shanghai Liberation Daily. We have reprinted it because this article is also meaningful to the readers, authors, and editors of the People's Daily supplement.]

    谈办副刊
    魏文伯
    办副刊首先要看办给谁看，好像厨司做菜一样，首先要看做给谁吃。只有摸清了客人的胃口，始能做出适合客人的菜味。“朝花”副刊的主要读者是工人、农民和干部。这几年来，工人的文化水平有了很大提高，一般的都有高小、初中以上的水平；郊区农民的文化水平也有所提高。应该首先满足他们的要求。此外，也要兼顾知识分子的需要，他们和工农的需要在许多方面是可以统一的；只要是密切联系生活、反映实际斗争、又写得生动活泼的东西，工人、农民和干部喜欢看，知识分子也喜欢看。
    “朝花”副刊的内容和形式都应该多样化，这一着很要紧。因为，读者千千万万，对象不同，喜好也不同，如客人吃菜一样，爱好甜、酸、麻、辣、咸、淡，不能强求一律。过去解放日报副刊“朝花”的缺点之一就是不够多样化，内容单调，形式呆板，老是一个调调儿。今后在内容方面，首先要加强思想指导性，反映当前的现实生活和斗争的各个方面，起促进作用，这是主要的；可是这样还不够，也正如请客吃饭一样，要有荤菜，也要有素菜。所以还要刊登自然科学知识、社会生活、小常识等等有益的文章，开辟人们的眼界。要有歌颂的作品，也要有批评、有讽刺的文章。其目的是为促进社会主义，而不是促退社会主义，是起积极作用，而不是起消极作用。
    “朝花”副刊的形式也要多样化，有杂文、小说、特写、诗歌、传记等等。文章要通俗简明，一般以六七百字为主，最长只能一千字左右。文章长了，版面能容纳的东西就少了，副刊就无法多样化了，看的人也就少了。
    要开门办副刊。既要找作家、专家写，特别要找能写、能说、能唱的工人、农民群众写。编辑要放下架子，到群众中去组稿写稿，使编者和读者结合起来。要办一个群众喜爱的副刊，首先工作人员要能接近群众，了解群众，和群众同呼吸共喜忧，这是工农情感的问题，也是办好副刊的根本问题。
        〔编者附记：这是中共上海市委书记处书记魏文伯同志为上海解放日报副刊“朝花”所写的一篇文章，我们特加以转载，因为这篇文章对人民日报副刊的读者、作者和编者也都是有意义的。〕
