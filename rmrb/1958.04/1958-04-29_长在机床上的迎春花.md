    Forsythia Blooming on the Machine Tool
    Lugong
    Forsythia is blooming everywhere on the great land of the motherland... There are forsythia growing in the soil, and there are forsythia growing on machine tools—that is, the new folk rhymes on the big-character posters plastered all over the factory buildings.

    In the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, our workers are striding forward heroically, engaging themselves in selfless labor in accordance with the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater faster, better, more economical results, to catch up with Britain in steel and other major products within fifteen years.

    Chen Canzhi, a fourth-grade milling machine worker and member of the Communist Youth League in the Shanghai Tool Factory workshop, has exceeded his production quota on every one of his work tickets. Since the call to catch up with Britain in fifteen years was issued, he has voluntarily proposed revisions to the quota more than twenty times. Once, the quota setter gave him a batch of screws with a quota of ten minutes each, asking him to estimate the working hours himself, saying, "Look, how many minutes do you need?" He smiled and held up three fingers, saying, "Three minutes is enough." Chen Canzhi was confident and completed the task in just over two minutes when he started the machine. In Shanghai alone, there are more than just ten or a hundred young shock workers like Chen Canzhi. The youth furnace front analysis group of the Machine Repair General Factory’s laboratory worked hard together, diligently studying, improving operations, and innovating technologies. In nine days, they continuously created sixty-seven new records, with a quality reaching one hundred percent. We cannot correctly estimate how many long-distance runners will appear on the road of the Great Leap Forward in a single day! At the same time, the worker brothers are writing quick clappers and poems with the hands that start the machine:

    Young workers are many heroes,
    Miracles one after another;
    Before meals, it's still a new record,
    After meals, it's already outdated.

    To dedicate everything for the happiness of hundreds of millions of people is the characteristic of our era. This desire to make everyone live a good life is reflected in the song of the printing and dyeing workers:

  Sister: Pick a colorful cloud, pluck a ray of sunset,
    Gather some sunshine, cut a section of rainbow.
    Golden needles fly up and down,
    A hundred flowers bloom wherever the golden needle goes.
    Dragonflies and grasshoppers want to leap,
    A spring scene on the brocade.
  Sister: Everyone says your craftsmanship is clever,
    Sister's work makes everyone smile.
    Flowers are lifelike, bees and butterflies are fascinated,
    Girls and children clap and jump when they put them on.

    Not only is everyone exerting a high degree of creativity, but even those retired workers whose hair has turned white and whose later years of happy life have been arranged by the state are also running back into the factories:

    Old man Zhang, getting old,
    Runs to the factory early in the morning,
    Looking east, looking west,
    Picks up a broom and starts sweeping.
    Calling you, "Old man Wang,
    Why do you get up so early?" "Little girl, listen to the explanation, retired two years ago to enjoy old age; machines will rust if they are not used, I can't bear not to work! The factory is my parents' home, where else can I run if not to the factory?" (Cheng Zhengming, Shanghai Second Machine Factory)

    On the big-character posters that are all over the factory buildings, hanging in the dining halls and offices, the most numerous of the new folk rhymes written by the worker comrades are those praising the collective heroes in the production competition—competing to be advanced, competing in enthusiasm: A Great Leap Forward in production in Factory Seven, every hero compares enthusiasm. Unity and tightness are even more important, turning bad steel and rotten iron into gold. Class A breaks through fifty tons, quality first, no defective products. Whip the horse and add a whip, heroes catch up to be advanced. The company plans for fifty thousand tons, we raised it to one hundred thousand and zero. Catching up with Britain in steel production, the workers of Factory Seven are determined. In order to realize industrialization, come, compare and compete, see who climbs the advanced peak!
        (Sun Quangen, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 7)

    We cannot count the forsythia on the great land of the motherland, nor can we count how many new folk rhymes the worker brothers have created. Let us warmly applaud these forsythia blooming on the machine tools!

    长在机床上的迎春花
    路工
    祖国的大地上，迎春花到处在开放……有长在泥土里的迎春花，也有长在机床上的迎春花——那就是贴满厂房的大字报上的新歌谣。
    在大跃进的高潮中，我们的工人正迈开英雄的步伐，按照多快好省的方针，从事忘我的劳动，要在钢铁和其他主要产品上在十五年内赶上英国。
    上海工具厂车间的一位四级铣工青年团员陈灿芝，他的工票上的生产数字，每一张都超过定额。自从提出十五年赶上英国以来，他连续二十多次，自动提出修改定额。有一次，定额员把一批定额十分钟的螺丝交给他，让他自己估计工时，对他说：“你看，要几分钟？”他笑一笑伸出三个指头说：“三分钟就够了。”陈灿芝的心里有底，双手一开动机床，两分多一点的时间完成了。像陈灿芝这样的青年突击手，在上海一地，也不是十个百个。机修总厂试验室青年炉前分析小组，共同苦干、苦钻，改进操作，革新技术，九天内，连续创造了六十七项新纪录，质量达到百分之百。我们不能正确估计，在跃进的道路上一天内出现多少个长跑能手！同时，工人弟兄用开动机轮的手，写着快板和诗：
    青年工人英雄多，
    奇迹一个连一个；
    饭前还是新纪录，
    饭后已成背时货。
    为了千百万人的幸福，供献自己的一切，正是我们时代的特色。这种让人人过美好生活的意愿，反映在印染工人的歌里：
  姐：采朵彩云摘片霞，
    集些日光截段虹。
    金针上下翩翩飞，
    金针到处百花生。
    蜻蜓蝈蝈欲飞跃，
    锦缎上一片春景。
  妹：人人都称你手艺巧，
    姐姐工作使万人笑。
    鲜花逼真蜂蝶迷，
    姑娘儿童穿上拍手跳。
    不但人人在发挥高度的创造性，而且那些头发白了，国家给他安排好晚年欢乐生活的退休工人，也跑进工厂里来了：
    张老伯，年纪老，
    清早就往厂里跑，
    东看看，西瞧瞧，
    拿起扫帚把就扫。
    叫你一声：“王老伯，
    为啥起得这样早？”“小姑娘，听分晓，前年退休来养老；机器不用要生锈，我不干活也难熬！工厂是我爹娘家，不到工厂往哪跑？”（上海第二机械厂　程正明）
    在爬满厂房，挂满饭厅、办公室的大字报上，工人同志所写的新歌谣，数量最多的，是歌颂集体英雄的生产竞赛——比先进，比干劲：七厂生产大跃进，英雄个个比干劲。团结加紧更要紧，坏钢烂铁变黄金。甲班突破五十吨，质量第一无废品。骑上骏马再加鞭，英雄迎头赶先进。公司计划五万吨，我们提到十万零。钢铁产量赶英国，七厂工人有决心。为了实现工业化，来，比一比，赶一赶，看谁登上先进峰！
        （上钢七厂　孙泉根）
    我们数不清祖国大地上的迎春花，我们也无法统计工人弟兄创作了多少新歌谣。让我们向这些开在机床上的迎春花热烈鼓掌吧！
