    Let Scrap and Waste Materials Stand Shoulder to Shoulder with Finished Products
    Jinxi Machine Factory Launches "Sideline Production"
    (Our newspaper Taiyuan, 16th dispatch) Taiyuan State-owned Jinxi Machine Factory, in addition to producing planned products, is using leftover materials, end cuts, and waste materials from the production of large-scale products to engage in "sideline production." In the first quarter, they manufactured more than twenty types of small electric motors, water pumps, and other agricultural machinery and daily necessities.
    Jinxi Machine Factory is a factory that produces a variety of large-scale power machinery. This year, in addition to producing products required by the national plan, it also undertook a large number of production tasks for large-scale electric motors, water pumps, and seamless steel pipes for manufacturing these equipments for agricultural basic construction. When manufacturing these mechanical equipment with finished materials, there were a lot of leftover iron bars, steel, iron sheets, and scrap wood. However, due to different specifications and standards, they were once treated as waste. In this anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the factory proposed: "Let side materials and waste materials stand shoulder to shoulder with finished products," and make each piece of steel, iron, and wood of different sizes and shapes into a variety of useful products. The silicon steel scrap left over from making large and medium-sized electric motors was previously treated as scrap steel and transported to steel plants to be re-melted and rolled into large steel; now, the workers in the motor repair workshop, in conjunction with their own business, have made small 2.8 kW electric motors. The power repair workshop responsible for repairing boilers collected waste and scrap from the production workshop to make small water pumps urgently needed by the countryside. Workers in the woodworking workshop used scrap iron sheets, iron bars, and old car belts to make cheap, sturdy and beautiful lounge chairs and tricycles, cradles etc. that children love.
    Because the factory has a wide variety of jobs, there are inevitably uneven phenomena in equipment utilization and labor use. In particular, auxiliary workshops such as equipment maintenance and power maintenance have surplus machinery and labor in peacetime. In the production of small products with edge materials, scraps, and waste materials, the auxiliary workshop undertakes the main task, which improves the utilization rate of working hours.
    Jinxi Machine Factory has regarded the use of edge materials, scraps, and waste materials to produce small and diverse production and living supplies as a long-term method of increasing production and practicing economy. In order to promote this new work, a factory-wide "sideline" product exhibition has recently been held, and some workshops have organized "sample groups" to solicit customer opinions in the market, and based on the specific situation of the factory, they have proposed dozens of new samples.

### 让边料废料和成材平起平坐  晋西机器厂开展“副业生产”

    让边料废料和成材平起平坐
    晋西机器厂开展“副业生产”
    本报太原16日电　太原国营晋西机器厂在生产计划产品外，利用做大型产品剩余的边料、截头和废料搞“副业生产”。第一季度制造了二十多种小型电动机、水泵等农业机械和生活用品。
    晋西机器厂是生产多种大型动力机械的工厂。今年除生产国家计划要求的产品外，还承担了大批为农业基本建设用的大型电动机、水泵和制造这些设备的无缝钢管等生产任务。用成材制造这些机械设备的时候，剩下来的碎铁条、钢、铁片和碎木料很多。但因规格、标准不同，曾经把它当废料处理。在这次反浪费、反保守运动中，这个厂提出：“让边料、废料和成材平起平坐”，把每一件大小、形状不同的钢、铁、木材制成各式各样有用的产品。作大、中型电动机剩下的矽钢片边料，过去都当废钢运到钢铁厂重新熔炼、轧制成大型钢材；现在电机修理车间工人们结合自己业务，又制成了二点八瓩的小型电动机。担负检修锅炉的动力检修车间收集了生产车间的废料、碎料制成农村急需的小型水泵。木工车间工人们用废铁皮、铁条、元车皮带作成了便宜、结实而又美观的躺椅和小孩子们喜爱的三轮自行车、摇篮等。
    这个厂由于工种繁多，在设备利用和劳力使用上难免出现忙闲不均的现象。特别是设备维护和动力检修等辅助车间，平时机械和劳动力都有剩余。在用边料、碎料、废料制作小型产品中，辅助车间担负了主要的任务，这就提高了工时利用率。
    晋西机器厂已把利用边料、碎料、废料生产小型多样的生产、生活用品当成增产节约的长期办法。为了推动这项新的工作，最近举办了全厂性的“副业”产品展览会，有的车间组织了“样品组”到市场上征询顾主意见，并根据本厂具体情况又提出了数十种新样品。
