Can Agricultural Cooperatives Run Factories? How To Do It?
    Xu Shi, Xu Shiwen

    The question of whether agricultural cooperatives should and can run factories, what kind of factories to run, and who to rely on to run them is a new issue raised by the current great leap forward in local industry. The news from Panyu County, Guangdong Province, published in today's newspaper, provides us with a very good inspiration.

    Everyone says that the water conservancy movement of last winter and this spring was well done and beautifully executed. What exactly are its advantages? The advantage lies in its distinct mass character. In the water conservancy movement, the whole party and the entire people participated, with the masses contributing money and labor. Therefore, it was as if a magical power of summoning wind and rain and overturning mountains and seas had appeared. The movement was not only carried out enthusiastically, but also achieved the requirements of being more, faster, better, and more economical. Cadres leading the great leap forward in local industry can draw some "lessons" from this water conservancy movement. Panyu County's approach of boldly mobilizing the masses and implementing the practice of every cooperative running factories is in line with this requirement.

    Why do agricultural cooperatives need to run factories? As the First Secretary of the Panyu County Party Committee said, this can not only give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, but also partially meet the agricultural cooperatives' needs for industry. These needs are not adequately met by the industries run by the county and township alone. Only by fully mobilizing the masses, with every cooperative running factories, and with county, township, and cooperative-level industries dividing labor, cooperating, and supporting each other, can a situation of local industries being as numerous as stars in the sky emerge.

    What kind of factories should agricultural cooperatives run? This is a fundamental question concerning the direction of agricultural cooperatives running factories, and it deserves our attention. If it is not done well, the cooperative's industry will deviate from the track of agricultural production and will directly hinder the development of agricultural production. Therefore, regulations should also be established to specify what should be done and what should not be done. Generally speaking, all factories run by cooperatives should revolve around agricultural production and serve agricultural production, mainly for self-production and self-use, such as the repair of farm tools, the processing and manufacturing of farm fertilizers, and the small-scale processing of agricultural products. This can avoid the problem of product sales and prevent the neglect of agriculture. Agricultural product processing industries that are subject to unified purchase and sale and must be processed and manufactured centrally by the state and local authorities should not be run by agricultural cooperatives. In this way, it can be ensured that the factories run by cooperatives can advance along the correct path and shine brightly in promoting agricultural production.

    农业社能不能办工厂？怎样办？
    许实　许世文
    农业社要不要和能不能办工厂？办些什么工厂？依靠谁办？这是目前地方工业大跃进提出的新问题。今天本报发表的广东省番禺县的消息，正好给我们一个很好的启发。
    去冬今春的水利运动，人人都说它搞得好，搞得漂亮。它的好处究竟在哪里呢？好处正是在于它具有鲜明的群众性。在水利运动中全党全民动手，群众出钱出力。因此，它就像出现了呼风唤雨、排山倒海的魔力一样，运动既搞得热火朝天，又能达到多、快、好、省的要求。领导地方工业大跃进的干部，都可以从这次水利运动中取点“经”。番禺县放手发动群众，实行社社办工厂的做法，正符合这个要求。
    农业社为什么需要办工厂？正如番禺县委第一书记同志所说，这样做，既可以发挥群众的积极性，又能部分地满足农业社对工业方面的需求，这些需求，目前光靠县、乡办的工业还不够。只有充分发动群众，社社办工厂，县、乡、社三级工业分工协作，互相支援，地方工业才能出现一个星罗棋布的局面。
    农业社办些什么工厂？这是一个关系农业社办工厂的根本方向问题，很值得我们注意。搞得不好，社的工业就会离开农业生产的轨道，并会直接妨碍农业生产的发展。因此也应该定个规章。规定哪些该办哪些不该办。一般地说来，凡社办的工厂，都应当围绕农业生产、为农业生产服务，以自产自用为主，如农具的修理，农家肥料的加工制造，小量的农产品加工等。这样可以避免产品发生销路问题，并且避免忽视农业的现象，凡是统购统销，必须由国家和地方集中进行加工制造的农产品加工业，农业就不要办。这样，就能保证社办的工厂能够沿着正确的道路前进，为促进农业生产而大放异彩。
