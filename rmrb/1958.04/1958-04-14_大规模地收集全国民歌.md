The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department has issued a notice to local county committees calling for "immediate organization of folk song collection." The notice states: Many folk songs praising the Great Leap Forward in production have emerged among the various ethnic groups in Yunnan. It not only enriches the cultural life of the people but also promotes the growth of socialist consciousness among the various ethnic groups. Therefore, great attention should be paid to collecting them (see page 1 of this newspaper on April 9).

According to recent news, many places have already started this work. Their method of collecting folk songs is through the mass line, going deep into the masses, relying on the masses, and recording and sorting the folk songs. This is a much more complete method of collecting folk songs than any in our history. Some counties have already compiled some folk song collections. It seems that this work has aroused considerable attention from leading organs in various places, and it is fully capable of being carried out on a large scale. This is extremely valuable work. It is of great significance for the development of China's literature and art (especially the development of poetry and songs).

Judging from the folk songs that have already been collected and published in newspapers and periodicals, these products of the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses vividly reflect the magnificent momentum of China's people's production and construction, and demonstrate the soaring socialist consciousness of the working masses. "Poetry expresses intent," and these socialist folk songs truly express the noble aspirations and heroic spirit of the masses in building socialism. A folk song from Yuxian County, Henan, has the following lines: "We must make the nine hundred and thirteen mountain tops bow their heads to the people one by one." Farmers in Xuyong County, Sichuan, sing: "Not afraid of cold, not afraid of hunger, Luo Guo Mountain must admit its mistake to me." A folk song from Macheng, Hubei, goes like this: "The baskets are full, the carrying pole is bent, Mom, come and see, I'm carrying a mountain on my shoulder."

These are good poems that combine realism and romanticism. In the large-scale production struggles after agricultural cooperativization, farmers realized the greatness of labor, the greatness of collective strength, and personally experienced the superiority of the socialist system. They were able to be forward-looking, boldly fantasize, passionately sing, and create such imaginative masterpieces full of revolutionary optimism. The image of farmers in these works is no longer Yang Bailao, who cries to heaven and earth, but the resourceful "Lu Ban immortal," the Sun Wukong who makes havoc in the Heavenly Palace, and the sage "Da Yu Wang" who controlled the floods. They negated the "Jade Emperor" and "Dragon King of the Sea" who had oppressed them for generations, and proudly said: "I am the Jade Emperor," "Members of the commune are in charge of flood control." They firmly believe that they can "command all the mountains and rivers" and rapidly "cross the Yellow River and the Yangtze River" in increasing the grain production level of their hometowns.

Such poetry is poetry that promotes productivity, poetry that inspires the people, and poetry that unites the people. As long as these works are collected from the masses and then promoted among the masses, they will definitely achieve great results.

Folk ballads are "vigorous and fresh" and have always been the soil of poetry and literature. They will also play a role in promoting today's new poetry creation. Whether in ideological content, language art, or style and form, their characteristics are worthy of attention and learning by poets. Since China's first collection of poems, "The Book of Songs," it has had a precious tradition of recording ballads. Excellent poems in all dynasties have drawn rich nourishment from folk ballads. During the May Fourth New Culture Movement, Peking University took the lead in collecting ballads, and the trend of collecting ballads was once very popular, with many collections being published one after another. However, although the past era left us with many beautiful folk poems, which became an inexhaustible source for poets to draw nourishment from, the old era was not an era in which the people were in power. The ballads they used to express their labor life and spiritual world mostly disappeared like the wind. Fortunately, those that were not lost and were preserved by word of mouth became an important part of our national cultural treasure. After the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the work of recording folk ballads entered a new period, not only excavating more works that express social life, but also containing brand-new revolutionary ballads. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, people have heard many folk songs from the hearts of all ethnic groups praising the Communist Party, praising Chairman Mao, and singing about their new lives; various long and short songs, such as the Mongolian "Gada Meilin," the Sani "Ashima," the Miao "Ancient Songs," the Dai "Zhaoshutun," the Han climbing songs of Inner Mongolia, the Hui "Hua'er," the Zhuang "Huan," etc., are truly dazzling and beautiful. These traditional or newly produced folk songs are undoubtedly precious food needed by the masses and poets. The development of Chinese new poetry will undoubtedly be influenced by these ballads. Therefore, in order to develop our poetry art, large-scale collection of national folk songs is also an indispensable task. At the same time, we must also pay attention to exploring the treasures of ballads from past generations that are still traceable and passed down by word of mouth, so that they will not disappear again.

This is an era of poetry, and we need to use drilling rigs to deeply excavate the land of poetry, so that folk songs, mountain songs, folk narrative poems, etc., gush out like crude oil. We must not only faithfully record them, select and print them, but also sort them out and study them, and provide them to poetry workers as nourishment to enrich themselves. Only by going to the masses, combining with the masses, learning from the masses as teachers, and learning from the poetry created by the masses themselves can poets create works that serve the masses.

### 大规模地收集全国民歌

    大规模地收集全国民歌
    云南省委宣传部向各地县委发出了“立即组织搜集民歌”的通知，通知中说：云南各族人民中出现了很多歌颂生产大跃进的民歌。它不但丰富着人民的文化生活，而且有利于各族人民社会主义意识的增长。因此，应该十分注意把它们搜集起来（见4月9日本报第一版）。
    根据最近的消息，已经有不少地方在进行这项工作。他们收集民歌的方法是通过群众路线，深入群众，依靠群众，把民歌记录下来，分类整理，这比我们历史上任何时期收集民歌的方法都要完善得多了。已经有些县已经编出了一些民歌集子。看来，这项工作已经引起了各地领导机关相当的重视，已经完全有条件可以大规模地进行。这是一项极有价值的工作。它对于我国文学艺术的发展（首先是诗歌和歌曲的发展）有重大的意义。
    从已经搜集发表在报刊上的民歌来看，这些群众的智慧和热情的产物，生动地反映了我国人民生产建设的波澜壮阔的气势，表现了劳动群众的社会主义觉悟的高涨。“诗言志”，这些社会主义的民歌的确表达了群众建设社会主义的高尚志向和豪迈气魄。河南禹县的一首民歌中，有这样的句子：“要使九百一十三个山头，一个个地向人民低头。”四川叙永县的农民唱的是：“不怕冷，不怕饿，罗锅山得向我认错。”湖北麻城的一首民歌是这样四句：“笼子装得满满，扁担压得弯弯，娃的妈呀你快来看，我一头挑着一座山。”
    这些是现实主义和浪漫主义相结合的好诗。在农业合作化以后的大规模的生产斗争中，农民认识到劳动的伟大，集体力量的伟大，亲身地体会到社会主义制度的优越性，他们就能够高瞻远瞩，大胆幻想，热情奔放，歌唱出这样富于想像力的、充满革命乐观主义精神的杰作。农民的形象在这些作品中早已不是呼天抢地的杨白劳了，而是足智多谋的“鲁班仙”、大闹天宫的孙悟空，以及治水的圣人“大禹王”。他们否定了曾经世世代代压在他们头上的“玉皇大帝”和“海龙王”，而自豪地说：“我就是玉皇”，“治水龙王社员当”。他们深信自己能够使“万水千山听调动”，使自己家乡的粮食增产的水平迅速地“跨黄河，过长江”。
    这样的诗歌是促进生产力的诗歌，是鼓舞人民、团结人民的诗歌。只要把这些作品从群众中搜集得来，再推广到群众中去，就一定能够收到很大的效果。
    民间歌谣“刚健清新”，历来都是诗歌文学的土壤。它对于今天的新诗创作也将起一种促进的作用，无论在思想内容上，语言艺术上，体裁形式上，它们的特色都值得诗人们的注意和学习。我国从第一部诗歌总集“诗经”起，就有着记录歌谣的宝贵传统，历代优美的诗歌没有不是从民间歌谣汲取了丰富营养的。五四新文化运动中，北京大学首倡搜集歌谣，搜集歌谣的风气也曾经盛极一时，陆续出版了不少集子。但是，尽管过去的时代给我们留下许多民间的美妙的诗歌，成为诗人们吸取营养的取之不尽的源泉，旧时代毕竟不是人民当权的时代，他们用以表达自己的劳动生活和精神世界的歌谣，绝大部分像风一般地永远消失了；幸而未遭散失，为人们口耳相传保留下来的，则成为我们的民族文化宝库的重要部分。毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表后，民间歌谣的记录工作跨入了一个新的时期，不仅更多地发掘了表现社会生活的作品，其中也有着崭新的革命歌谣。中华人民共和国成立以后，人们听到了许多从心坎里飞出来的各族人民歌颂共产党、歌颂毛主席、歌唱他们自己新生活的民歌；各种的长诗短歌，如蒙古族的“嘎达梅林”，撒尼族的“阿诗玛”，苗族的“古歌”，傣族的“召树屯”，内蒙古汉族的爬山歌，回族的“花儿”，僮族的“欢”，等等，真是琳琅满目，美不胜收。这些传统的或者新产生的民间歌谣，无疑都是人民群众和诗人们所需要的珍贵食粮。中国新诗的发展，无疑将受到这些歌谣的影响。因此，为了发展我们的诗歌艺术，大规模地收集全国民歌也是决不可少的一项工作。同时，我们还要注意发掘尚有踪迹可寻的历代口传至今的歌谣宝藏，使它们不致再消失。
    这是一个出诗的时代，我们需要用钻探机深入地挖掘诗歌的大地，使民谣、山歌、民间叙事诗等等像原油一样喷射出来。我们既要把它们忠实地记录下来，选择印行，也要加以整理和研究，并且供给诗歌工作者们作为充实自己、丰富自己的养料。诗人们只有到群众中去，和群众相结合，拜群众为老师，向群众自己创造的诗歌学习，才能够创造出为群众服务的作品来。
