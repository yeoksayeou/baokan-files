    Governments and Public Continue to Call For
    U.S. and Britain Should Follow the Soviet Union to Stop Nuclear Testing
    The Albanian Government Warmly Supports the Soviet Union's New Decision
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 12th (via Albanian Telegraph Agency, April 11th): The Albanian government issued a statement regarding the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, stating that the Albanian government and people warmly welcome and support this decision.
    The statement pointed out that the Albanian government supports the Soviet government's appeal to the governments of the United States and Britain to halt atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. If these two governments can give a positive response to the Soviet government's request, it would be a correct step welcomed by public opinion. If they refuse to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, it would not only be unreasonable but would also arouse the anger of the people of all countries, and these two governments would bear a serious responsibility.

    各国政府和公众继续呼吁
    美英应效法苏联停止核试验
    阿尔巴尼亚政府热烈支持苏联新决定
    新华社地拉那12日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社11日讯：阿尔巴尼亚政府就苏联决定单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器发表声明指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府和人民热烈欢迎和支持苏联这一决定。
    声明指出，阿尔巴尼亚政府支持苏联政府要求美、英两国政府停止试验原子武器和氢武器的呼吁。如果这两国政府能够对苏联政府的要求作出肯定的答复，那将是受到舆论欢迎的正确步骤。如果它们拒绝停止试验原子武器和氢武器，那就不仅是没有道理的，而且会引起各国人民的愤怒，而这两国政府将担负严重的责任。
