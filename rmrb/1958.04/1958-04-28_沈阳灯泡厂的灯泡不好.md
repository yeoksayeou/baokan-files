    Shenyang Light Bulb Factory's Light Bulbs Are No Good
    The light bulbs produced by the Shenyang Light Bulb Factory are said to last for one thousand hours. Assuming the average user uses the light for five hours a day, it should last for two hundred days. However, two light bulbs in my house broke within twenty days. Both of these light bulbs broke because the filament broke. When the first light bulb's filament broke, I thought it was caused by the vibration of pulling the lamp head when turning it off. Later, I installed a pull cord, but it broke again after only five days. Later, I heard from the surrounding masses that the light bulbs produced by the Shenyang Light Bulb Factory are generally of poor quality. Gao Rui

    沈阳灯泡厂的灯泡不好
    沈阳灯泡厂生产的灯泡，说是能使用一千小时。按一般用户每天平均点灯五小时计算，应该使用二百天。可是我家在不到二十天内就坏了两个灯泡。这两个灯泡都是因为断丝而坏了。在第一个灯泡断丝时，我还以为是关时拉灯头震动造成的。后来我安上拉线，不过五天又坏了。后来听周围群众普遍反映了沈阳灯泡厂生产的灯泡质量不好。　高瑞
