　　Xi'an People's Enamel Factory Product Quality Approaches World's Highest Level

　　(Our Newspaper News) The workers of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, by promoting the spirit of originality and boldly innovating technology, have in a very short period of time made the gloss of their daily-use enamelware catch up with that of the United States and Sweden. The quality indicators such as acid resistance, alkali resistance, adhesion, and heat resistance have also reached or approached the advanced international level, realizing the leap forward target originally set for three years; at the same time, the total output value in the first quarter exceeded the leap forward plan.

　　In early February, after the factory put forward the "Daily-use Enamelware Quality Catches Up with the United States and Sweden in Three Years" leap forward plan, the factory's Party Committee and administrative leaders determined the leadership policy of promoting the spirit of originality, boldly innovating production technology, and breaking through outdated technical specifications and quotas. The factory's Party Secretary and factory directors went among the workers to study key production issues and provide specific ideological leadership, quickly promoting a lively technical innovation situation characterized by daring to think, daring to do, and daring to surpass predecessors.

　　In the first month of the leap forward, 310 rationalization proposals emerged, of which more than 200 were innovations or improvements in operating techniques and equipment. The factory established two technical innovation teams, and each workshop established research groups to be responsible for testing and immediately popularizing these proposals. Due to continuous technological innovation, product quality and output increased by leaps and bounds, and more than 400 new records appeared in one month. The original plan required adding three coating and firing shifts due to the increased workload, but this month no new shifts were added, and the production plan was still overfulfilled by 28%. In the past, a first-class product rate of 60% to 70% was considered good, and it was almost unimaginable for a shift to produce all first-class products. However, this month there were more than 40 shifts that produced all first-class products, and the factory's first-class product rate greatly exceeded the original target.

　　Due to the increased workload in the enamel-making workshop, the monthly consumption of enamel powder increased from 140,000 catties to 260,000 catties. The existing grinding machine capacity was insufficient, and some people requested adding two No. 1 grinders. The workshop's Party branch proposed: "Adding equipment, is that still a leap forward? Can we solve the problem without adding equipment?" This proposal was supported by the broad masses of workers. Worker Liu Zhihua carefully studied the grinding machine and came up with a new method that solved the problem without adding equipment.

　　Technician Zhang Shida discovered minerals in the tap water and considered using distilled water to formulate the enamel. Someone said: "Someone in a factory in Shanghai once raised such an opinion, but it may not be practical, so it was shelved for six years without further action." The factory's Party Committee believed: We shouldn't always think "If others don't do it, we can't do it." Let's try it. The result of the trial was very good, and it was immediately put into production, increasing the gloss of the light lake-colored basin by more than ten degrees, reaching 106 degrees on the outside of the basin, catching up with the gloss of American products. The other major export products have also generally increased from 88 degrees in the past to over 90 degrees, exceeding the Swedish product.

### 敢想　敢干　敢独创  西安人民搪瓷厂产品质量接近世界最高水平

    敢想　敢干　敢独创
    西安人民搪瓷厂产品质量接近世界最高水平
    本报讯　西安人民搪瓷厂职工发扬独创精神，大胆革新技术，在很短时间内就使日用搪瓷的光泽赶上了美国、瑞典，耐酸、耐碱、密着力、耐热等质量指标也达到或接近国际先进水平，实现了原定要三年时间才能达到的跃进目标；同时第一季度的总产值超额完成了跃进计划。
    2月初，这个厂提出“日用搪瓷质量三年赶上美国、瑞典”的跃进规划后，中共厂党委和行政领导就确定了发扬独创精神，大胆革新生产技术，突破陈旧技术规范和定额的领导方针。厂党委书记和厂长们，到工人当中去研究生产关键问题和具体进行思想领导，迅速促成了一个敢想敢干、敢于超越前人的生动活泼的技术革新局面。
    在跃进的头一个月内，就涌现出三百一十项合理化建议，其中有二百多项都是革新或改进操作技术和设备的。厂里成立了两个技术革新队，各车间成立了研究组来负责试验和立即推广这些建议。由于技术不断革新，产品质量和产量突飞猛进，一个月就出现了四百多项新纪录。原规划因为任务加大，要新增三个涂烧班，可是这个月没有新增班次，仍然超额28％完成了产量计划。过去一级品率有百分之六、七十就很不错了，一个班全部出一级品简直不敢想。可是本月份就一连出现了四十多个全部生产一级品的班次，全厂一级品率大大超过了原定指标。
    制琅车间由于任务加大，月用琅粉量由十四万斤提高到二十六万斤，现有磨粉机能力不足，有人要求添购两部头号磨，车间党支部提出：“添设备，还算什么跃进呢，不能不添设备就解决问题吗？”这个提法得到广大工人群众的支持。工人刘志华去仔细研究磨粉机，想出了一个新办法，不添设备，问题也解决了。
    技术员张士达发现自来水中有矿物质，考虑用蒸馏水来配方。有人说：“上海某厂也曾有人提出这样的意见，可能不切实际，所以搁置了六年没有下文”。厂党委认为：我们不要总想“别人不干的，我们就不能干”，试试看。试的结果很好，立即投入了生产，使浅湖色面盆光泽提高了十多度，盆外部达到了106度，赶上了美国产品的光泽。其他出口主要产品也普遍由过去88度提高到90度以上，超过了瑞典产品。
