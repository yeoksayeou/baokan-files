Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 14th. After winning second prize in the piano competition of the International Tchaikovsky Piano and Violin Competition, young pianist Liu Shikun told our reporter today that he is determined to become a both red and expert Red pianist.

When talking about the reasons for winning the second prize in this international competition, Liu Shikun said that this should first be attributed to the Party and the country's cultivation of me, and the country gave me good learning conditions. In addition, it should also be attributed to the guidance of Soviet professors.

Liu Shikun said that this competition was the most difficult of all international piano competitions. A total of seventeen pieces had to be performed, including two concertos, while past international competitions generally did not exceed ten pieces and one concerto. The preparation time for this competition was short, only four months. After arriving in Moscow, my guiding professor, Febert, put in a great deal of effort to teach me. This professor, who is already over sixty years old, is one of the most famous piano professors in the Soviet Union. Although he is not in good health, he often mustered a lot of strength in four months, even increasing class time, to patiently help me. In addition, he specially invited two assistants to help me. It was precisely because of the great enthusiasm of these Soviet experts that I learned a lot from them, especially in terms of musical sense. My understanding of piano art has also deepened. During the four months of practice, Soviet classmates at the Moscow Conservatory also gave me great encouragement and warm care.

Liu Shikun said that through this competition, although I have improved, I must not be satisfied. The country requires us to have a high level of skill and political ideology. In the future, I will work hard in the direction of being both red and expert, learn from the Soviet Union even better, and be determined to be a Red pianist.

    刘诗昆得奖后发表谈话
    立志做一个红色钢琴家
    新华社莫斯科14日电　青年钢琴家刘诗昆今天在取得柴可夫斯基钢琴和小提琴国际比赛的钢琴比赛第二奖之后对本社记者说，他立志要成一个又红又专的红色钢琴家。
    在谈到这次获得国际比赛第二奖的原因时，刘诗昆说，这首先应归功于党和国家对我的培养，国家给了我良好的学习条件。此外还应归功于苏联教授的指导。
    刘诗昆说，这次比赛是历次国际钢琴比赛最难的一次。一共要演奏十七个节目，其中要有两个协奏曲，而过去一般国际比赛都不超过十个节目，一个协奏曲。这次比赛的准备时间短促，只有四个月时间。来莫斯科后指导教授费伯特下了极大的功夫给我上课。这位已经有六十多岁高龄的教授是苏联最有名的钢琴教授之一。虽然身体不好，但他在四个月中经常拿出许多力量甚至用增加上课时间来耐心地帮助我。此外，他还特地请了两位助手对我进行帮助。正是由于苏联专家这种巨大的热情，使我从他们那里学习到了许多东西，特别是在音乐感方面。我对钢琴艺术的认识也更加深了。在四个月的练习中，莫斯科音乐学院的苏联同学也给了我很大的鼓励和热情的关怀。
    刘诗昆说，通过这次比赛，我虽有所提高，但是决不能满足。国家要求我们有高度的技巧和政治思想水平。今后我要向又红又专的方向努力，要更好地向苏联学习，要立志做一个红色的钢琴家。
