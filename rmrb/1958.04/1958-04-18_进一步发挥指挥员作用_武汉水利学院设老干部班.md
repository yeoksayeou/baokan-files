    Further Enhance the Role of Commanders
    Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy Establishes Old Cadre Class
    Entrusted by the Hubei Provincial Department of Water Conservancy, the Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy will soon open an old cadre class focusing on farmland water conservancy. The students in this class will mainly consist of directors of water conservancy bureaus from various special districts and counties in Hubei Province, as well as some county party secretaries. The initial quota is set at one hundred people. The duration of the study will be three months. Through short-term study, these comrades who have certain practical experience in rural water conservancy construction will gain a more comprehensive understanding of the basic scientific knowledge related to farmland water conservancy. This will enable them to better play the role of a commander in water conservancy construction after returning to their posts. The class is currently actively being prepared and will officially commence in May. (Li Yu)

    进一步发挥指挥员作用
    武汉水利学院设老干部班
    武汉水利学院受湖北省水利厅委托，将在最近开办一个农田水利方面的老干部班。这个班的学员大部分是湖北省各专区的和县的水利局长，还有部分是县委书记，名额初步确定为一百人。学习期限三个月。通过短期学习，使这些在农村水利建设方面具有一定实际工作经验的同志，对于有关农田水利科学的基本知识，得到较为全面的了解，从而使他们在回到工作岗位后，在水利建设中更好地发挥一个指挥员的作用。这个班现正积极进行筹备工作，5月份将正式开课。　（李育）
