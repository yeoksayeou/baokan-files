Poetry Should Use Punctuation
Liu Lanshan

Let me first describe three situations: In the old days, when studying in private schools, the teacher would teach the Four Books, and as he taught, he would use a vermilion pen to punctuate each passage. This so-called punctuation meant placing marks or circles after each sentence. Nowadays, when publishing houses reprint classical books, one essential task is to punctuate them, which means adding semi-modern punctuation. Some use commas throughout, while others use periods throughout. In 1951, the former Central People's Government Publishing Administration formulated and promulgated the "Rules for the Use of Punctuation Marks."

Why do we do this? The reasons are simple: First, to enable students to read sentences clearly; second, to help modern readers punctuate sentences themselves; and third, to help readers correctly understand the article, and to ensure that the author's original intention is expressed in a standardized way. Moreover, modern punctuation marks have become an integral part of the written language, just like the type in a typesetter's case, occupying an indispensable space.

Therefore, nowadays, when people write articles, including the creation of old-style poetry, almost everyone uses punctuation.

However, there are exceptions. Some poets simply do not like to use punctuation.

There are several types of poetry that do not use punctuation. Here, I will only mention two: poems with sentences within sentences are punctuated; exclamation marks and question marks are used; otherwise, no punctuation is used at all. Many of Tian Jian's recent works are like this:

    Brothers, 佧佤 people
    You live here
    You live here
    How many thousands of years have you lived?
        — From the long poem "佧佤 People," a section in the "Dedication"

            Sentences within sentences are separated by blank lines; otherwise, no punctuation is used. Lou Shiyi's translation of the poetry collection "Be Angry, Fuji" is like this: Who killed me Every night The vengeful ghosts wander from this street to that street Blood-soaked mouths Shattered chests Waving broken swords Dragging tattered uniforms Wandering in the ruined streets

    — Hokujo Hayamio: "Song of Fallen Soldiers," a section

The content of the former can be understood, but the relationship between the second and third sentences is unclear, and one can only guess while reading. In the latter, the "me" in the first sentence and its relationship with the subsequent parts are also difficult to understand, making it harder to grasp the emotion.

If these two old poets do this, many young people follow suit. I have thought for a long time about the benefits of not using punctuation in poetry, but I cannot think of any. However, I believe that poetry should use punctuation, for the reasons mentioned above.

### 诗应该加标点

    诗应该加标点
    刘岚山
    先说三种情况：旧时候，在私塾念书，老师教四书，教到那里，就用朱砂红笔断到那里，所谓断，就是把那段逐句打捺点或圆圈；现在出版社重印古典书籍，有一项必须做的工作，就是断句，也就是加上半新半旧的标点，有的一律为逗号，有的一律为句号，1951年，前中央人民政府出版总署就制订并公布了“标点符号使用法”。
    为什么要这样呢？理由很简单：第一是使学生能读断句子；第二是帮助现代读者自己能读断句子；第三是帮助读者正确理解文章，也使作者原意能够合乎规范地表达出来；而且，现在的标点符号，已成为文字组成部分，正如排字架上的字格一样，它占有不能缺少的一格。
    所以，现在人写文章，包括旧体诗词的创作在内，几乎没有不加标点的。
    但也有例外，有些诗人就是不爱加标点。
    这种不加标点的诗有好几种，这里只说两种：句中有句的诗，加；凡遇惊叹号和问号者，加；其余一概不加。田间同志近作有不少就是这样：
    弟兄呵，佧佤人
    你们就住在这里
    你们住在这里
    住了有几千年？
        ——长诗“佧佤人”的“献
            词”中一段句中有句的诗，空一行，此外不用任何标点。楼适夷同志所译“愤怒吧，富士”诗集就是这样：是谁杀死了我每晚上　怨鬼们从这街头流浪到那街头血淋淋的口　破碎的胸膛挥着折断的宝剑拖着破烂的军装在废墟的街头流浪
    ——北条旱苗：“阵亡兵
        士的歌”中一节
    前者的内容可以理解，但第二句和第三句关系不明确，只得猜着读下去；后者第一句中的“我”以及和后面的相互关系，也都难弄清，感情更不好掌握。
    这两位老诗人如此，跟着学的年青一代也有不少。诗不加标点的好处何在，我想了很久，没有想出来，但我认为诗是应该加标点的，理由如上所说。
