Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 3rd – The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe released a 400-page report on the state of the world economy on the 2nd. The report acknowledges that the economies of the socialist countries are leaping forward, while the economies of the capitalist countries are declining.

The report states, "Last year, the living standards in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe saw considerable improvement, with harvests reaching record post-war levels. After wages saw larger increases than in previous years, all countries in the region increased spending on consumer goods, with (personal) income increasing by 20% in Hungary and roughly 9% in the Soviet Union."

The report states that in Eastern Europe, "the industrial situation was better than expected everywhere last year, with industrial growth rates largely similar to those of 1956, with East Germany and Albania even achieving more impressive growth." In agriculture, grain production alone increased by 8.5 million tons compared to 1956. The report says that in Eastern European countries, more cars and bicycles were manufactured in assembly plants last year, more washing machines, televisions, and sewing machines appeared in homes, and more food was processed. The average person's life was better than at any time since the war.

The report shows that the situation in the West is exactly the opposite. The economic situation in many Western countries is deteriorating, and the prospects are bleak.

The report says that the United States is currently experiencing an economic recession, and the decline in personal income "will increasingly affect consumer spending," while "the rapidly decreasing order books increasingly prove the survey of declining investment in 1958." The report says that the economic recession in the United States seems to have a direct impact on Western European countries, but also an indirect impact due to the reduction in overseas purchasing by the United States, which reduces the purchasing power of overseas countries.

The report says that in Western Europe, the "disturbing situation" in 1957 was "the increasing fading of prosperity rather than continued inflation." The growth rate of economic activity in Western European countries this year was lower than in 1955, which was already the second year of declining growth rates. The report says, "From the situation in the second half of 1957, it can be seen that the trend of economic stagnation in the three major industrial countries of Western Europe (Britain, France, and West Germany) is very likely to deepen. Although some other Western European countries may have different development trends for a certain period of time, they will eventually converge to the same path."

The report says that if Western Europe wants to expand, it will encounter payment difficulties. Recently, Western Europe has been owing the United States about 500 million pounds of US dollars a year in goods and services, of which about three-quarters are compensated by the US military expenditure in Western Europe, and the rest is compensated by "invisible" income. The report says that because the current reliance on credit policies, it seems that the demand of any major Western European country will not increase much, therefore "the gloomy trend in Western Europe last year will probably continue."

The report says that in view of the economic recession in the United States and the continuous weakening of the status of other major exporting countries, "the continued slowdown in the economic expansion of Western Europe (not to mention the absolute decline) is bound to have a very serious impact on the (capitalist) world economy."

### 东风日强西风弱　经济盛衰大不同  联合国欧洲经济委员会承认铁的事实

    东风日强西风弱　经济盛衰大不同
    联合国欧洲经济委员会承认铁的事实
    新华社3日讯　日内瓦消息：联合国欧洲经济委员会2日发表了一个长达四百页的有关世界经济情况的报告。这个报告承认，社会主义阵营国家的经济正在跃进，而资本主义阵营国家的经济却在倒退。
    报告说，“去年苏联和东欧的生活水平有了相当大的提高，收获量达到了战后的创纪录水平。在工资有了比前几年为大的提高之后，这个地区所有国家在消费品方面所花的钱都增加了，匈牙利的（个人）收入增加了20％，苏联大概增加了9％”。
    报告说，在东欧，“去年任何一个地方的工业情况都比预期的要好，工业的增长率大体上同1956年的增长率相似，其中东德和阿尔巴尼亚的工业甚至取得了更动人的增长。”在农业方面，单单是谷物一项就比1956年增加了八百五十万吨。报告说，在东欧国家，去年有更多的汽车和自行车从装配间制造出来，更多的洗衣机、电视机和缝纫机在家庭里出现，加工的食品也更多了。平均每个人的生活比战后任何时期都要好。
    报告表明西方的情况恰好相反。许多西方国家的经济情况在恶化，而且前景很黯淡。
    报告说，美国目前正经历着一次经济衰退，个人收入的下降“将要越来越多地影响消费者的支出”，而“订货单急剧减少的迹象也越来越多地证明1958年投资下降的调查”。报告说，美国经济衰退看来对西欧国家不仅将有直接影响，而且还由于美国的海外采购减少引起海外国家购买力降低而有间接的影响。
    报告说，在西欧，1957年“令人不安的状况是繁荣的日益减色而不是通货继续膨胀。”这一年西欧国家的经济活动增长率低于1955年，这已经是增长率下降的第二个年头了。报告说，“从1957年下半年的情况可以看出，西欧三大工业国（英、法、西德）经济停滞的趋势还极可能加深。西欧其他一些国家虽然可能在某一个时间内发展趋势不同，但最终还是要异途同归的。”
    报告说，如果西欧要扩张，它将遇到支付困难。最近的情况是，西欧在货物和劳务方面一年拖欠美国约合五亿英镑的美元亏空，其中约四分之三是由美国在西欧的军事开支来补偿的，其余以“无形”收入来补偿。报告说，由于当前依靠信贷政策，不论哪个西欧大国的需求看来都不会增加很多，因此“去年西欧的不景气趋势大概将持续下来”。
    报告说，鉴于美国的经济在衰退和其他主要输出国地位的不断削弱，“西欧经济扩张的继续放慢（更不用说绝对下降）势将对（资本主义）世界经济发生非常严重的影响”。
