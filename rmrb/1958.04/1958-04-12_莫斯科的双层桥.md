    Moscow's Double-Decker Bridge
    This photograph shows the design of a new bridge over the Moscow River. Once completed, this bridge will create a shortcut from the center of Moscow to Lenin Hills. Although the section of the bridge over the river is only 200 meters long, the total length reaches 2 kilometers.

    What distinguishes this bridge from all other bridges in Moscow is that it is double-decked, with the lower level for underground trains and the upper level for pedestrians and regular vehicles. Another prominent feature is that the entire bridge is assembled from reinforced concrete components. This is an innovation in the history of bridge construction worldwide. According to the designers, this bridge requires 28,800 cubic meters of reinforced concrete components.

    As everyone knows, building bridges over deep-water rivers usually involves driving steel sheet piles for the foundation, which is a heavy, costly, and time-consuming task. This bridge will use wooden piles for its foundation, which is better, faster, and more economical.

    All reinforced concrete components are manufactured in factories and then transported to the construction site. The section of the bridge over the river is the most complex part of the project. This section of the bridge deck is being erected in two halves from the longitudinal axis. First, a giant overhead crane is used on the riverbank to position each reinforced concrete component, weighing 50 tons, and firmly join them together. This half of the assembled bridge deck weighs 4,200 tons and is 200 meters long. Then, this behemoth must be placed on floating bridge pontoons in the water and then onto the foundation. Building and transporting such heavy reinforced concrete components on water is a first in the Soviet Union.

    Currently, the bridge construction project is in full swing. The "Lenin Hills" subway station will be located on the Moscow River. Architects plan to use the space under the bridge on both banks to build winter sports venues, cafes, and dance halls, as they will be sheltered from rain and snow by the bridge.

    莫斯科的双层桥
    这张照片是莫斯科河上一座新桥的设计图。这座桥建成后将开辟一条从莫斯科市中心到列宁山的近路。虽然桥在河上的部分只有二百公尺长，可是总长度却达二公里。
    这座桥与莫斯科所有的桥的不同之点是，它是双层的，下层走地下火车，上层走行人和普通车辆。另一个突出的特点是，桥全部都是用钢筋混凝土构件装配的。这是世界桥梁建筑史上的一个创举。据设计师估计，这座桥需用二万八千八百立方公尺的钢筋混凝土构件。
    大家知道，在深水河上架桥一般都用钢板桩打基础，因此工程很繁重，造价高而且费时间。这座桥将用木桩作基，这样又好、又快、又省。
    所有的钢筋混凝土构件都是在工厂作好后送到工地上的。河面上这段桥的工程最复杂。这段桥身是从纵轴分成两半分别架设的。首先要在河岸边用巨大的高架起重机把每一块重达五十吨的钢筋混凝土构件安置好并牢固地结在一起。这一半装配好的桥身就有四千二百吨重，二百公尺长。然后必须把这个庞然大物放到水中的浮桥船上再架到基础上。在水上建筑和运输这样重的钢筋混凝土构件，在苏联还是头一回。
    目前桥的建设工程正在紧张进行中。“列宁山”地下铁道站将设在莫斯科河上。在两岸桥下的空地上，建筑师们打算利用来建设冬季运动场、咖啡馆、跳舞厅。因为那里有桥的遮盖不受雨雪吹打。
