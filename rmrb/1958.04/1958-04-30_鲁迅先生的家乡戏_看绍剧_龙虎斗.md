    Lu Xun's Hometown Opera

    —Watching Shaoxing Opera "Dragon and Tiger Fight"
  　Ma Shaobo
    I have long admired the Shaoxing Opera, the hometown opera of Mr. Lu Xun, which he wrote about many times in his works. Only today, with the Zhejiang Shaoxing Opera Troupe's performance in Beijing, did I have the opportunity to see it, fulfilling a long-held wish, and I am indescribably happy!
    The first performance I saw was "Dragon and Tiger Fight," a play depicting the story of Ouyang Fang, a treacherous court official in the early Song Dynasty, who plotted to harm the loyal minister Hu Yanshou Ting, and Hu Yan Zan, Shou Ting's son, avenging his father. Usually, "Dragon and Tiger Fight" is considered the latter part of "Going Down to Hedong." Now, after the script has been reorganized, the entire plot is connected, making the story more complete and the theme more prominent. The reorganizers have made appropriate revisions to certain plot points, which are very well done.
    This play is one of the excellent traditional repertoires of Shaoxing Opera. It is a great tragedy. After watching it, one cannot help but revisit the couplet on Yue Fei's tomb in West Lake: "Since ancient times, loyalty and treachery have been like ice and charcoal; today, right and wrong are distinguished from falsehood." I think these two lines are the theme of "Dragon and Tiger Fight." The lyrics sung by Ah Q, "I regret that I mistakenly killed Brother Zheng in a drunken state..." and "I will beat you with my steel whip..." are precisely from "Dragon and Tiger Fight."
    Many opera genres in our country have this repertoire. Peking Opera, Sichuan Opera, Qin Opera, Jin Opera, Hebei Bangzi, Yunnan Opera, and Henan Opera call it "Going Down to Hedong," also known as "Bailong Pass" or "Beheading Shou Ting." Generally, the latter part is not often performed; Han Opera, Jin Opera, and Sichuan Opera also have the latter part of the "Dragon and Tiger Fight" repertoire, called "Fengyun Hui" (Meeting of Heroes).
    Shaoxing Opera's "Dragon and Tiger Fight" retains rich and beautiful performing arts, with powerful and vigorous singing, and many uncommon and unique movements. The actors have creatively developed them, making the performance of this play even more full.
    The Zhejiang Shaoxing Opera Troupe has many excellent actors. The casting in this play is quite well-rounded. The famous actor Liu Ling Tong (Zhang Zongyi), who plays Hu Yan Zan, and the famous actor Chen Hegao, who plays Zhao Kuangyin, each have unique skills that complement each other. Liu Ling Tong's posture is stable, his movements are charming, his expressions are rich, and his eyes are agile and powerful. He portrays Hu Yan Zan's rough and innocent, upright and brave character, and his irreconcilable spirit of revenge, very profoundly, especially in the scene of coercing the Song Emperor, which is very imposing.
    Chen Hegao's portrayal of Zhao Kuangyin has a majestic demeanor. His performance is neither lukewarm nor overdone, fitting his identity perfectly. His singing is loud and rhythmic, full of emotion and changes, pleasant to the ear. Especially the crying aria when pleading with Hu Yan Zan, which is different from the usual "crying head," is crying while singing, both crying and singing, extremely moving. Many opera genres have singing methods with crying sounds, but it is rare to see such a seamless integration, distinct rhythm, and moving and pleasant sound, combined so fittingly and naturally.
    The Zhejiang Shaoxing Opera Troupe has brought many traditional repertoires for this performance in Beijing, such as "Pingdingshan," "The Reed Flower Story," "Selling the Houzaimen," "The Fisherman and the Woodcutter," "Dragon and Phoenix Lock," and many excellent plays from "Journey to the West," which are Liu Ling Tong's best. In addition, there is also "The Returning Woman," which depicts the modern rural class struggle, bringing great joy to the audience in the capital.
    We sincerely congratulate the development and prosperity of Shaoxing Opera. What we see is obviously very different from what Mr. Lu Xun saw in his childhood. The audience of the Shaoxing Opera is no longer "the families of the local squires in the black-awning boats" and "the sparsely standing dozens of idlers from this village and neighboring villages." However, deeply touched by "A Village Opera," when I sat in the theater enjoying the performance, I felt as if I had returned to my childhood, drifting in a white-awning boat on the small river with shimmering fishing lights and a hazy moonlit night, letting "the clear fragrance from the broad beans and wheat on both banks and the water plants at the bottom of the river, mixed in the water vapor, blow against my face."

### 鲁迅先生的家乡戏——看绍剧“龙虎斗”

    鲁迅先生的家乡戏
    ——看绍剧“龙虎斗”
  　马少波
    在鲁迅先生笔下多次写到他的家乡戏——绍兴大班，真是神往已久了；直到今天，浙江绍剧团来京公演，才有机会看到，宿愿得偿，说不出的欢喜！
    我首先看到的剧目是“龙虎斗”，这出戏是描写宋初奸臣欧阳方谋害忠良呼延寿廷，寿廷之子呼延赞为父报仇的故事。通常是把“龙虎斗”作为“下河东”的后部，现在剧本经过整理，把全部情节连在一起，故事更加完整，主题思想也更为突出了，整理者把某些情节作了适当的改动，改动的很好。
    这出戏是绍剧优秀传统剧目之一，是一个大悲剧，使人看了，不禁重温西湖岳坟上那副“自古忠奸同冰炭；于今是非辨伪真”的诗联，我想，这两句诗就是“龙虎斗”的主题。阿Q所唱的“悔不该酒醉错斩了郑贤弟……”、“我手执钢鞭将你打……”正是“龙虎斗”中的唱词。
    我国不少剧种都有这一剧目，京剧、川剧、秦腔、晋剧、河北梆子、滇剧、豫剧叫作“下河东”，又名“白龙关”、“斩寿廷”，一般不常演后半部；汉剧、晋剧、川剧也有后半部“龙虎斗”剧目，叫作“风云会”。
    绍剧的“龙虎斗”，保留了丰富优美的表演艺术，唱腔激越有力，有很多不常见的特有的身段，演员又创造性的加以发展，使这出戏在表演上更加饱满。
    浙江绍剧团拥有不少的优秀演员，在这出戏里搭配的相当整齐，饰演呼延赞的名演员六龄童（章宗义）和饰演赵匡胤的名演员陈鹤皋，各有绝技，相得益彰。六龄童的工架稳定、身段妩媚、表情丰富、眼神灵动有威，表现呼延赞粗犷天真、刚直悍勇的性格和不共戴天的复仇精神，十分深刻；特别是威逼宋帝一场戏，很有气势。
    陈鹤皋饰演的赵匡胤，气度轩昂，表演得不瘟不火，恰合身份，他的唱工洪亮而有韵味，感情丰富，多变化，悦耳受听，特别是向呼延赞哀求时的一段哭唱，与平常“哭头”不同，是唱中带哭，且哭且唱，极感动人。带哭音的唱法，各剧种都有，但是浑然一体、节奏鲜明、听起来又动人、又悦耳、结合得这样熨贴自然，是不多见的。
    浙江绍剧团这次来京公演，带来了很多像“平顶山”、“芦花记”、“卖后宰门”、“渔樵会”、“龙凤锁”等传统剧目和六龄童最拿手的“西游记”中的许多好戏；此外，也有表现现代农村阶级斗争的“还乡女”，为首都观众带来了很大的眼福。
    我们衷心祝贺绍剧的发展和繁荣，我们所看到的显然和鲁迅先生在童年所看到的大大不同了；绍兴大班的看客，也不再是“乌篷船里那些土财主的家眷”和“疏疏朗朗的站着的几十个本村和邻村的闲汉们了”；但是由于受“社戏”深刻的感染，当我坐在剧场里欣赏演出的时候，仿佛自己也回到了童年，坐着白篷船飘荡在点点渔火月夜朦胧的小河上，让那“两岸的豆麦和河底的水草所发出来的清香，夹杂在水气中扑面的吹来。”（见鲁迅：“社戏”）
