    Large-Scale Collaboration is the Basic Principle of Socialist Large-Scale Production
    Heilongjiang Builds Economic Collaboration Network
    Significant Achievements in Industry, Capital Construction, Transportation, and Urban-Rural Collaboration
    (People's Daily, Harbin, April 27th, special correspondent Sun Ruogang reports) The experience of Heilongjiang Province in carrying out large-scale economic collaboration proves that organizing socialist economic collaboration on a large scale is the basic principle of socialist large-scale production and an important measure to promote the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. It can promote mutual learning, improve technology, and improve quality; it can concentrate efforts to develop and create new technologies; it can enable the advanced to help the backward and achieve common improvement.
    Heilongjiang Province began to organize collaboration in a planned, organized, and led manner as early as 1954. This collaboration is carried out under the unified balance of the state plan, implementing the principle of combining regions and departments, with regions as the main focus. Since 1957, based on the province's industrial situation and economic ties, four economic collaboration zones have been organized, centered on four cities: Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, and Mudanjiang, combined with nearby counties. At present, more than 100 factories throughout the province have established long-term fixed collaborative relationships, and collaboration between factories and agricultural cooperatives has also been widely developed. A province-wide economic collaboration network has been formed.
    This large-scale economic collaboration has played a significant role in promoting the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year.
    This year, Heilongjiang Province widely organized collaboration in the trial manufacture of China's first set of large-scale nitrogen fertilizer plant equipment, ensuring the trial manufacture of this new product. More than 30 factories were quickly organized throughout the province to collaborate with Harbin Boiler Factory in the trial manufacture of high-pressure vessels and Heping Machinery Factory in the trial manufacture of air compressors. Dozens of local factories and handicraft cooperatives are also collaborating with Harbin Turbine Factory in the trial manufacture of large turbines and Fularji Heavy Machinery Factory in the trial manufacture of blooming mills this year.
    Organizing collaboration between large state-owned factories and medium and small-sized factories has played a significant role in solving their technical problems. The technical problems encountered by the local state-owned Harbin No. 1 Machinery Factory in the production of tractors were quickly solved with the help of engineers from Harbin Boiler Factory. This product collaboration and technical collaboration between large, medium, and small factories has played a role in concentrating efforts to trial-produce major new products and learning from each other's strengths to achieve common improvement.
    In terms of supporting agricultural mechanization, the leading departments in charge of collaboration promptly organized collaboration in the design and production of agricultural machinery. Forty-two professors, engineers, and technicians from six units, including Northeast Agricultural College, Dong'an Machinery Factory, and Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, designed the Songhua River No. 1 universal tractor based on the principle of utilizing waste materials; and organized nine factories and handicraft cooperatives, including Xinjiang Machinery Processing Factory, Songjiang Machinery Factory, and Harbin University of Technology Practice Factory, to collaborate in trial production. Economic collaboration zones centered on cities such as Harbin, Jiamusi, and Mudanjiang have also recently convened collaboration meetings to tap the production potential of the machinery industry and balance and allocate agricultural machinery production tasks.
    In the past few years, Heilongjiang Province has achieved significant achievements in organizing collaboration in industrial production, capital construction, transportation, labor, urban-rural areas, and comprehensive utilization of surplus materials and waste. In terms of industrial production collaboration, in the past four years, local industries have been organized to produce non-standard equipment for newly built key projects and collaborative products such as large parts and accessories for large state-owned factories, totaling more than 30 million units (pieces), and collaborative castings and forgings totaling more than 90,000 tons. In capital construction collaboration, since last year, according to statistics from 43 construction units in Harbin alone, 26.95 million yuan has been saved for the state. In transportation collaboration, collaboration in transportation, material production, and supply has been organized, a unified joint labor competition has been carried out, and unified technical operating procedures have been implemented, which has also achieved great results. In terms of organizing seasonal fixed and non-seasonal temporary labor collaboration between various enterprises, according to statistics on labor collaboration from 32 units, more than 60,000 person-times of labor can be saved for the state each year. In addition, many achievements have been made in collaboration between urban and rural areas.
    According to the experience of Heilongjiang Province, constantly strengthening political and ideological work in collaboration and the personal involvement of leading comrades of Party and government at all levels are important guarantees for doing a good job in large-scale economic collaboration. In organizing large-scale economic collaboration, it is necessary to establish the overall thinking of socialist large-scale collaboration of "one for all, all for one" and constantly oppose departmentalism and uncooperative thinking of "seeking completeness" and "going it alone" that start from a local perspective.
    Strengthening the planning of collaboration is a very important measure in organizing collaboration. It can provide comprehensive care and rational arrangements for collaboration in a region. After Heilongjiang Province established a system for submitting collaboration plans in 1955, it changed the blindness of collaboration in the past and created conditions for organizing long-term fixed collaboration between enterprises. In the two years since the establishment of the reporting plan, some products with large batches and fixed production have been gradually organized into long-term fixed collaborative relationships according to the nature of the collaborative tasks. More than 100 factories throughout the province have established this collaborative relationship. The long-term fixation of product collaboration is an extremely important direction in industrial production collaboration. It can formally incorporate collaborative products into the state plan and is very beneficial to improving quantity, improving quality, and reducing costs.
    Appropriately establishing some rules, regulations, and methods for collaboration is a necessary condition for ensuring the orderly development of collaboration and can gradually institutionalize collaboration. The ten related rules and regulations that Heilongjiang Province has formulated, such as the "Industrial Production Collaboration Management Measures," have enabled the collaboration work to begin to move onto a normal track, completely changing the chaotic situation of "busy leadership departments and difficult to resolve disputes" in the past.
    The smooth development of economic collaboration work in Heilongjiang Province is also inseparable from the timely establishment of collaboration management institutions at all levels. At present, Heilongjiang Province and the four collaboration zones all have a set of specialized collaboration management institutions and a certain number of full-time cadres. The establishment and improvement of collaboration management institutions have played an important organizational role in strengthening the leadership and supervision of collaboration, unified planning, comprehensive balance, and promoting the development of collaboration.

    大协作是社会主义大生产的基本原则
    黑龙江建成经济协作网
    工业、基本建设、交通运输、城乡协作都取得显著成就
    本报哈尔滨27日电　本报记者孙若刚报道：黑龙江省开展经济大协作的经验证明：组织社会主义经济大协作，是社会主义大生产的基本原则，是促进工农业生产大跃进的一项重要措施。它可以互相取长补短、提高技术、提高质量；可以集中力量发展和创造新的技术；可以使先进帮助落后，求得共同提高。
    黑龙江省从1954年就开始了有计划、有组织、有领导地组织协作。这种协作是在国家计划统一平衡下，贯彻地区与部门相结合并以地区为主的原则。从1957年开始，即根据全省工业情况和经济联系情况，以哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、牡丹江等四个城市为中心，与附近各县相结合，组织了四个经济协作区。现在，全省已有一百多个工厂建立了长期固定协作关系，工厂与农业社的协作也已普遍展开。一个全省性的经济协作网已经形成。
    这种经济大协作对促进今年工、农业生产大跃进起了显著的作用。
    今年，黑龙江省在试制我国第一套大型氮肥厂设备中，由于广泛地组织了协作，保证了这项新产品的试制。在全省范围内迅速组织起三十多个工厂，与试制高压容器的哈尔滨锅炉厂和试制空气压缩机的和平机械厂协作。哈尔滨汽轮机厂今年试制的大型汽轮机、富拉尔基重型机器厂试制的初轧机，也都有几十个地方工厂和手工业合作社与它们协作。
    组织国营大型工厂与中、小型工厂协作，对解决它们的技术难题起了很大作用。地方国营哈尔滨第一机械厂，在生产拖拉机中遇到的技术难题，在哈尔滨锅炉厂的工程师的帮助下，很快得到了解决。这种大、中、小型工厂的产品协作和技术协作，起到了集中力量试制重大新产品和互相取长补短、共同提高的作用。
    在支援农业机械化方面，协作主管领导部门，及时地组织了农业机械的设计和生产的协作。以东北农学院、东安机械厂、哈尔滨机车车辆修理厂等六个单位组织起四十二名教授、工程师和技术人员，根据利用废料的原则，设计出松花江一号万能拖拉机；并组织了新江机械加工厂、松江机械厂和哈尔滨工业大学实习工厂等九个工厂、手工业合作社进行协作试制。以哈尔滨、佳木斯、牡丹江等市为中心的经济协作区，最近也都召开了协作会议，挖掘了机械工业生产潜力，平衡和分配了农业机械的生产任务。
    在过去几年中，黑龙江省在组织工业生产、基本建设、交通运输、劳动力、城乡之间的协作和余材废料综合利用等方面，都获得了显著成就。在工业生产协作方面，四年来，组织地方工业为新建的重点工程生产非标准设备和为国营大型工厂生产大部件、配件等协作产品共达三千多万台（件），协作的铸件、锻件共有九万余吨。在基本建设协作中，从去年以来，仅据哈尔滨市四十三个建设单位的统计，即为国家节省了二千六百九十五万元。在交通运输协作中，组织了运输、物资生产、供应三个方面的协作，开展了统一联合劳动竞赛，贯彻了统一技术作业规程，也取得了很大成绩。在组织各企业之间季节性的固定和非季节性的临时的劳动力协作方面，据三十二个单位的劳动力协作的统计，每年即可为国家节省劳动力六万多人次。此外，在城乡之间的协作也都取得不少成绩。
    根据黑龙江省的经验，经常地加强协作中的政治思想工作和各级党、政领导同志亲自动手，是搞好经济大协作的重要保证。在组织经济大协作中，必须树立“我为人人，人人为我”的社会主义大协作的整体思想，不断反对从局部出发的本位主义和“求全”、“单干”的不协作思想。
    加强协作的计划性，是组织协作中的一项很重要的措施。它可以对一个地区的协作，进行全面照顾、合理安排。黑龙江省从1955年建立了提报协作计划的制度后，既改变了过去协作中的盲目性，又为组织企业间长期固定协作创造了条件。建立提报计划后的两年来，已根据协作任务的性质，逐步地把一些批量大、生产固定的产品组成为长期固定协作关系。全省已有一百多个工厂建立了这种协作关系。产品协作长期固定化是工业生产协作中一个极重要的方向。它可以使协作产品正式纳入国家计划，并且对提高数量、改进质量、降低成本等方面都有很大好处。
    适当地建立一些协作的规章、制度和办法，是保证协作有秩序发展的必要条件，并且可以使协作逐步走向制度化。黑龙江省已经制订出的“工业生产协作管理办法”等十项有关的规章制度，已使协作工作开始走向正常轨道，完全改变了过去协作领导部门那种“门庭若市、纠纷难解”的混乱局面。
    黑龙江省经济协作工作能够顺利开展，也与及时地建立各级协作管理机构分不开。现在，黑龙江省和四个协作区都有一套协作的专门管理机构，并有一定数量的专职干部。协作管理机构的建立与健全，对加强协作的领导和监督、统一规划、综合平衡和推进协作发展都起了重要的组织作用。
