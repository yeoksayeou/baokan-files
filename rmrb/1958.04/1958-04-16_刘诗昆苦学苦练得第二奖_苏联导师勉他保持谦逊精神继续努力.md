Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 15th: After Liu Shikun won the second prize in the Tchaikovsky International Violin and Piano Competition, Moscow Conservatory professors Feibert and lecturer Natason described to our reporter the process by which this young artist won the award.

These two pianists are Liu Shikun's tutors. They said that Liu Shikun faced significant difficulties when he began preparing for this competition because he was young and unfamiliar with many pieces. However, he is indeed a talented child who understood his responsibility and put in a great deal of effort to practice, thus achieving excellent results in a short period of time.

The two tutors said that almost the entire piano department of the Moscow Conservatory helped the Chinese pianist participating in the competition. Now we are very satisfied because Liu Shikun has not disappointed our expectations of him.

They finally pointed out specifically that Liu Shikun is a very talented young pianist with a broad future. They hope that he will maintain his humble spirit and continue to strive for greater achievements.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 15th: The Tchaikovsky International Piano and Violin Competition closed in Moscow on the 14th. The closing ceremony was held in the Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory, and an awards ceremony for the winners was also held.
