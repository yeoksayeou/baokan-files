    In these days of blooming spring, the Romanian government delegation, headed by Comrade Chivu Stoica, visited our country, bringing with them the precious brotherly friendship of the Romanian people. The distinguished guests were warmly welcomed by our people everywhere, and saw the deep friendship of the Chinese people for the Romanian people, blooming like spring flowers all over our land. The continuous strengthening of the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the socialist camp countries, led by the Soviet Union, has become an important force inspiring our people to build socialism.

    During their visit to our country, the Romanian government delegation held sincere and friendly talks with the leaders of our government. The joint statement issued by both sides fully reflects the significant achievements of the Sino-Romanian talks. In this meeting, both sides discussed the current international situation, further strengthening the unity of socialist countries, and developing friendly and cooperative relations between China and Romania, and reached complete agreement.

    In the talks, the Chinese and Romanian governments first affirmed the current favorable situation in the international arena where the East wind prevails over the West wind. The joint statement pointed out that the forces for maintaining world peace have become stronger, and as long as all peace-loving countries and people continue to strengthen unity and persist in struggle, the imperialist policy of war threats and conspiracies to create new wars will be difficult to succeed. Both governments reiterated their determination to continue to wage unremitting struggle for the lofty cause of maintaining world peace, together with all peace-loving countries and people. Undoubtedly, this statement once again demonstrates the confidence of the two countries in striving for world peace and will surely promote the common efforts of the two peoples to maintain world peace.

    The Soviet government's proposal for holding a summit conference and the Soviet Union's first unilateral decision to cease nuclear weapon testing fully demonstrate the Soviet people's will for peace and confidence in the forces of peace, and have deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, becoming the universal demand of hundreds of millions of people around the world. In the joint statement, the Chinese and Romanian governments expressed their full support for these two Soviet proposals and measures, which are greatly beneficial to world peace. At present, the imperialist countries are still doing everything possible to create tension. In Europe, the American aggressive bloc is attempting to push West Germany onto the road of preparing for nuclear war; the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe and the Romanian government's proposal to convene a summit conference of Balkan countries have not received due attention from Western countries. In the Asian and African regions, external subversive activities are threatening the sovereignty and independence of Indonesia, and the Algerian independence movement is undergoing the crazy suppression of colonialists; the United States and other countries participating in the "United Nations Forces" are still delaying the withdrawal of troops from Korea; and the peaceful reunification of Vietnam has not yet been achieved. The Chinese and Romanian governments, which have consistently made unremitting efforts to maintain world peace, are very concerned about the above situation. In the joint statement, the two governments sternly condemned the US aggressive bloc's conspiracy to carry out nuclear armament; reiterated their propositions, such as replacing military blocs in Europe and Asia with collective security systems; firmly supported all proposals and measures aimed at easing international tensions and maintaining world peace; resolutely supported the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against colonialism and for safeguarding national sovereignty and independence; and reiterated their continued development of political, economic and cultural ties with all countries based on the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. All of these once again embody the consistent peace policy pursued by the Chinese and Romanian governments and fully demonstrate the peaceful will of the Chinese and Romanian peoples and their deep concern for world peace.

    In the talks, the Chinese and Romanian governments discussed the issue of strengthening the unity of socialist countries and reached complete agreement. Both governments expressed deep satisfaction with the increasing consolidation and development of the unity and cooperation of socialist countries and highly appraised the two declarations of the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties. Both governments reiterated that they will continue to further strengthen the unity and cooperation of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. The efforts of the Chinese and Romanian governments and peoples in the past, present and future to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp are a significant contribution to the great cause of socialism and the cause of peace.

    In recent years, thanks to the joint efforts of the Chinese and Romanian governments and peoples, the political, economic and cultural cooperative relations between the two countries have undergone significant development. The visit of the Romanian government delegation and the talks between the Chinese and Romanian governments have further strengthened this cooperative relationship. This is not only beneficial to the socialist construction of the Chinese and Romanian peoples, but also beneficial to the peaceful competition between socialist countries and capitalist countries.

    Comrade Chivu Stoica and the distinguished guests of the Romanian government delegation left our capital yesterday to visit Northeast China, and then will proceed to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Mongolian People's Republic for friendly visits. We hope that the comrades of the delegation will bring the friendship of the 600 million Chinese people to our Romanian brothers and wish them continuous victories in the great socialist construction!

    中罗会谈的重大成果
    在这春暖花开的日子里，以基伏·斯托伊卡同志为首的罗马尼亚政府代表团，带着罗马尼亚人民珍贵的兄弟友谊，访问了我们的国家。贵宾们到处受到我国人民的热情欢迎，看到了中国人民对罗马尼亚人民的深厚友谊，像春天的花朵一样在我国土地上到处盛开。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国兄弟般的友谊和合作的不断加强，已经成为鼓舞我国人民建设社会主义的重要力量。
    罗马尼亚政府代表团在访问我国期间，同我国政府领导人进行了诚挚而友好的会谈。双方发表的联合声明，充分反映了中罗两国会谈的重大成果。在这次会谈中，双方就目前国际形势、进一步加强社会主义国家团结和发展中罗两国之间的友好合作关系等问题进行了讨论，并取得了完全一致的看法。
    中罗两国政府在会谈中首先肯定了目前国际上东风压倒西风的有利形势。联合声明指出，目前维护世界和平的力量已经更加强大，只要一切爱好和平的国家和人民不断地加强团结，坚持斗争，帝国主义进行战争威胁的政策和制造新战争的阴谋就难以得逞。两国政府重申，决心同一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，继续为维护世界和平的崇高事业进行不懈的斗争。无疑地，这一声明再一次表现了两国对于争取世界和平的信心，必将促进两国人民维护世界和平的共同努力。
    苏联政府关于举行最高级会议的建议和苏联首先单方面停止试验核武器的决定，充分显示了苏联人民的和平意志和对和平力量的信心，并且已深入人心，成为全世界亿万人民的普遍要求。中罗两国政府在联合声明中表示，完全支持苏联这两项大大有利于世界和平的建议和措施。目前，帝国主义国家仍然在千方百计地制造紧张局势。在欧洲，美国侵略集团正企图把西德推向准备核子战争的道路上去；波兰政府关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议和罗马尼亚政府关于召开巴尔干国家最高级会议的建议，还没有得到西方国家应有的重视。在亚非地区，外来颠覆活动正在威胁着印度尼西亚的主权和独立，阿尔及利亚的独立运动正在遭受殖民主义者的疯狂镇压；美国和其他参加“联合国军队”的国家仍在拖延从朝鲜撤军；越南的和平统一还未实现。一贯为维护世界和平进行不懈努力的中罗两国政府，对于以上这种情况十分关心。在联合声明中，两国政府严厉地谴责了美国侵略集团进行核子备战的阴谋；重申以集体安全体系代替欧洲和亚洲的军事集团等主张；坚定地支持一切目的在于缓和国际紧张局势、维护世界和平的建议和措施；坚决支持亚非各国人民反对殖民主义、维护国家主权和独立的斗争；并且重申根据不同社会制度国家和平共处的原则，继续同一切国家发展政治、经济和文化联系。所有这些，都再一次体现了中罗两国政府坚持不渝地执行的和平政策，并且充分显示了中罗两国人民的和平意志和对世界和平的深切关怀。
    在会谈中，中罗两国政府讨论了加强社会主义国家团结的问题，并且取得了完全一致的见解。两国政府对社会主义国家的团结合作日益巩固和发展深表满意，并对各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的两项宣言作了崇高的评价。两国政府重申将继续进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结合作。中罗两国政府和人民过去、现在和将来对加强社会主义阵营团结的努力，都是对伟大的社会主义事业和和平事业的重大贡献。
    几年来，由于中罗两国政府和人民的共同的努力，两国的政治、经济和文化合作关系有了重大的发展。这次罗马尼亚政府代表团的访问和中罗两国政府的会谈，又进一步加强了这种合作关系。这不仅有利于中罗两国人民的社会主义建设，而且有利于社会主义国家同资本主义国家的和平竞赛。
    基伏·斯托伊卡同志和罗马尼亚政府代表团的各位贵宾们昨天已离开我国首都前往我国东北参观，然后前往朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国进行友好访问。我们希望代表团的同志们把六亿中国人民的友谊带给我们的罗马尼亚兄弟们，祝他们在伟大的社会主义建设中节节胜利！
