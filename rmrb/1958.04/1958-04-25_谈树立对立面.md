Regarding the issue of establishing opposing viewpoints

Zhang Fan

Recently, I saw a big-character poster discussing the need to establish opposing viewpoints during meetings and discussions. This poster expressed dissatisfaction that leaders often fail to establish opposing viewpoints during discussions, stating that this is the result of certain leaders lacking a strong sense of responsibility, not thinking through issues, or being unwilling to express views that differ from others.

This comrade's criticism is correct, but the author would like to add some points here.

Opposing viewpoints in discussions are the reflection of contradictions in the development of things, manifesting as differences in people's understanding. These differences exist not only among leaders but also among ordinary comrades. For example, on the issue of streamlining institutions, due to differences in position, experienced problems, and ideological levels, there will be different views not only among leaders, between superiors and subordinates, among subordinate comrades, and between leading organs and subordinate units. The so-called opposing viewpoints should include various differences in understanding between those at the top, bottom, left, and right.

Although there are different opinions from top to bottom, the leadership core should first, as this comrade requests, present the different views among the leaders themselves when discussing issues. Firstly, leaders have a more comprehensive understanding of the situation, and their opinions are also more comprehensive; secondly, if this is not done, even if various different opinions are presented from all sides, but the leaders do not express their views because they are unfamiliar with the situation or are afraid of arguing with others, the result will inevitably be a confusion of voices and no consensus. Establishing opposing viewpoints is not an end in itself; the purpose of establishing opposing viewpoints is to seek a truly consistent understanding through debate. This is not difficult to achieve. Leaders only need to be concerned about one or several aspects of the cause managed by their unit to have their own views and opinions. Moreover, what needs to be discussed and decided by the leadership core is often not specific issues with strong professional or technical aspects, but rather issues of principle or political and ideological issues related to the implementation of guidelines and policies, making it easier for leaders to express their opinions. As for being afraid of expressing opinions that differ from others, this view itself violates the laws of development. Within a leadership core, it is common and normal to have inconsistent views on issues that have not yet been decided. There is no need to hide them. It is precisely by frankly presenting inconsistent views on the table for discussion and debate that we can seek consensus from disagreement. Moreover, only in this way can we have true consensus. Conversely, if we hide inconsistent opinions in our hearts and do not speak out, the consensus obtained in this way is not true consensus but false consensus.

The issues discussed by the leadership core often involve various aspects. Thus, the opposing viewpoints should not be limited to the different views among leaders but should also include the different views between superiors and subordinates, among ordinary comrades, and among relevant units. Only by truthfully presenting the various different views from top to bottom, left and right, that is, various contradictions and all aspects of contradictions, can we reflect the various contradictions and all aspects of contradictions, and can the discussion and decision of issues avoid the errors of subjectivism and one-sidedness. It is clear that there are different opinions from top to bottom, left and right, but during discussions, these different opinions are not paid attention to, and only the different opinions of the leadership are paid attention to. Even if discussions can be carried out, these discussions are incomplete, and it is easy to make mistakes of subjectivism and one-sidedness when deciding on issues.

Judging from the opinions expressed recently by many units, some leadership cores, when discussing issues, neither put forward their own different opinions nor pay attention to reflecting the different opinions of subordinates and relevant units. Therefore, I feel the need to offer some suggestions to these leading comrades: When holding meetings to discuss issues, not only should you dare to argue yourselves, but it is best to change the meeting procedures. Don't always have the leaders decide on the issues at the meeting and then transmit and deploy them downwards. If time and the nature of the issue permit, before the meeting, it is best to talk to the comrades below (including the subordinate units) first, listen to their opinions and requirements, and do not only listen to one kind of voice. Listen to various voices; do not only listen to voices that are consistent and similar to the leader's, but listen more to voices that are inconsistent with the leader's. Some leading comrades are precisely not very interested in listening to the different opinions of lower-level cadres, and even dislike it very much. When deciding on issues, they naturally do not think of consulting with the comrades below first. If we change our perspective and see deciding on issues as both the responsibility of the leadership and the responsibility of the masses, and pay attention to the differences between leaders when establishing opposing viewpoints, as well as the differences between superiors and subordinates and among subordinates, opposing viewpoints will naturally be easier to establish and will be very lively and rich.

    谈树立对立面
    张帆
    最近看到一张议论开会讨论问题要树立对立面的大字报，这张大字报对于领导方面开会讨论问题的时候常常树立不起对立面表示不满意，并且说明这是某些领导同志责任心不强，不去思考问题，或者是不愿意和别人表示不一致的看法的结果。
    这位同志批评的很对，可是作者还要在这里作些补充。
    讨论问题中的对立面，乃是事物发展中的矛盾反映在人们认识上的差异，这种差异不仅领导同志中有，一般同志中也有。比如对于精简机构问题，由于所处的地位、所感受的问题以及思想水平等的不同，不仅领导同志之间、上下级之间、下级同志之间以及领导机关和被领导单位之间，都会有各自不同的看法，所谓对立面，也就应该包括上下左右之间的各种认识上的分歧。
    尽管上上下下有不同的意见，但在领导核心讨论问题的时候，首先应该像这位同志所要求的，先把领导同志之间的不同看法摆出来。一来领导同志了解情况比较全面，意见也比较全面；二来如果不是这样，即使把各方面的不同意见摆了很多，而领导同志却因为自己不熟悉情况或者怕和别人发生争论而不表示意见，其结果必是众说纷纭莫衷一是。树立对立面本身，并不是目的；树立对立面的目的是为了经过争论，求得真正一致的认识。要做到这一点并不困难。领导同志只要关心本单位所管理事业的一个方面或几个方面，就会有自己的看法和意见。而且，需要领导核心讨论决定的，往往并不是一些业务性技术性较强的具体问题，而偏重于有关贯彻执行方针政策的原则问题或政治思想问题，领导也就更容易表示自己的意见。至于害怕表示和别人不一致的意见，这看法本身就是违反事物发展规律的。在一个领导核心之间，对尚未决定的问题，看法不一致，这是经常的也是正常的现象，完全用不着去掩盖，把不一致的看法坦率地摆到桌面上探讨争论，为的就是从不一致中求得一致，而且，也只有这样，才能有真正的一致；相反的，要是把不一致的意见藏在肚子里不说，这样取得的一致就不是真一致而是假一致。
    领导核心所讨论的问题，往往牵涉到各个方面，这样，树立的对立面中，不能只限于领导同志之间的不同看法，还应该包括上下级之间、一般同志之间和有关单位之间的不同的看法。只有把上下左右之间的各种不同看法，也就是各种矛盾都如实地摆出来，才能反映出各个矛盾和矛盾的各个方面，讨论和决定问题才有可能避免主观片面性的错误。明明上下左右之间有不同意见，而讨论时不注意这些不同意见，只注意领导方面的不同意见，即使能够展开讨论，这种讨论也是不全面的，决定问题就容易犯主观片面性的毛病。
    从最近很多单位鸣放出的意见来看，有些领导核心讨论问题的时候，既不会把自己的不同的意见提出来，又不注意反映下级和有关单位的不同的意见。由此感到需要向这些领导同志们提出一点建议：开会讨论问题的时候，不但自己要敢于争论，最好还能改变一下开会的程序，不要总是领导者在会上决定了问题，然后向下传达布置；如果时间和问题的性质许可，在开会以前，最好先和下面的同志（包括被领导的单位）谈谈，听听他们的意见和要求，而且不要只听一种声音。要听各种声音；不要只听和领导者一致和近似的声音，更要多听和领导者不一致的声音，而有些领导同志恰恰对倾听下级干部的不同意见很没兴趣，甚至很不喜欢，在决定问题的时候也就自然想不到先去和下边的同志商量商量。如果改变一下看法，把决定问题看成是领导的事也是群众的事，在树立对立面的时候要注意领导者之间的分歧，也注意上下之间、下级之间的分歧，对立面自然就容易树立起来，而且会十分生动丰富。
