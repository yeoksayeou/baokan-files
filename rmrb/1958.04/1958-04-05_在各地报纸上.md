    New Methods of Inspecting Spring Plowing
    Agricultural cooperatives in Changzhi Special District, Shanxi Province, are using mass airing of views and debates to inspect and promote current spring plowing production. The Shanxi Daily highlighted this news on the front page on April 2nd and published an editorial, considering it a new method of inspecting and promoting spring plowing production. In the Aiguo Agricultural Cooperative of Machang Township, Luan, through airing of views, problems existing in current agricultural production were exposed. Over ten thousand big-character posters were put up throughout the cooperative, criticizing the cooperative leaders for talking more than doing, shouting more than delivering, and having advanced targets but weak measures. For example, the original plan was to raise 1,300 pigs, but currently, there are only 120. There were no concrete measures on how to increase the numbers. These exposures served as a warning to the leading cadres. All cadres and members of the cooperative immediately took action and revised the plan. In a few days, more than 3,000 mu of land were leveled, and spring plowing was in full swing. The editorial said that using airing of views to inspect is a great method because it can burn away the exaggerating work style, leaving this bad style with nowhere to hide; it can mobilize the masses and establish a pragmatic and hardworking work style.
    Selling Farm Tools in the Fields
    The Guangxi Daily reported on March 30th that commercial departments in Yishan Special District are adopting new methods to promote new farm tools. They moved the means of production stores to the fields, demonstrated double-wheel double-share plows to the farmers who came to buy them, and taught them operating techniques. Only after teaching them the techniques of using, assembling, disassembling, and minor repairs were they allowed to take them home. In Laibin County, the double-wheel double-share plows sold using this method accounted for 20% of the total sales.
    Eighteen Martial Arts Skills
    On the 1st, the New Hunan Daily prominently introduced on the third page the experience of the Xiaoyang Agricultural Cooperative branch of the Communist Party in Miandu Township, Ling County, in closely integrating with reality and using a variety of forms to carry out propaganda and mobilization work. The cooperative's propaganda and mobilization methods include policy Q&A booths, radio stations, blackboards, mobile red flags, mobile indicator boards, field mobilization, big-character posters, cartoons, yu gu (a type of drum), mountain songs, reading newspapers, radio listening meetings, and moonlight evening gatherings, totaling eighteen kinds. These forms are lively, varied, and very popular among the masses. For example, the policy Q&A booth is affectionately called the "happy lock" by the masses. The radio station broadcasts good and bad examples in production to cooperative members every morning and evening, which is very helpful in promoting production. The newspaper's editor wrote a commentary, suggesting that other regions follow the example of the Xiaoyang Cooperative and let propaganda and mobilization work shine with extraordinary brilliance in the Great Leap Forward.
    Revolutionary Measures of the Normal College
    Shandong Normal College recently adopted a revolutionary measure: all teachers and students of the college take turns going to the countryside to run agricultural middle schools. The Dazhong Daily reported on this matter on the 3rd. The report said that the political and ideological awareness of the teachers and students of the college has improved during the rectification movement, and they have successively proposed the requirement to "go to the countryside to run agricultural middle schools." The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee gave their support and encouragement to their demands, and decided to use the Linqi and Heze Special Districts as the base for Shandong Normal College to run agricultural middle schools. The college is now working hard to formulate a plan for going to the countryside.

    检查春耕的新方法
    山西长治专区各地农业社，通过群众性的大鸣大放，检查和推动当前春耕生产。4月2日的山西日报一版突出报道了这个新闻，并发表了社论，认为这是检查推动春耕生产的新方法。潞安马厂乡爱国农业社，通过鸣放，揭露出当前农业生产中存在的问题，全社贴出上万张大字报，批评社领导上说的多，做的少；喊的多，兑现少；指标先进，措施无力。如原计划养猪一千三百口，现在仅有一百二十口，如何增加，没有具体措施。经过这些揭露，给领导干部敲响了警钟，全社干部、社员立即动手实干，重新修订计划，没几天已平整土地三千多亩，春耕搞得热火朝天。社论说，通过鸣放来检查，真是一种大好特好的方法，这样能烧掉工作中的虚夸作风，使这种坏作风无藏身之所；能发动起群众，树立实干苦干的工作作风。
    到田间卖农具
    广西日报3月30日报道了宜山专区各县商业部门采用新的方式，推销新式农具。他们把生产资料门市部搬到田间，当场向前来购买双轮双铧犁的农民试验，传授操作技术，教他们学习了使用、装卸、小修理的技术后，才让买回去。来宾县用这个办法推销掉的双轮双铧犁，就占总销数的20％。
    十八般武艺
    1日，新湖南报以三版显著地位介绍了酃县沔渡乡晓阳农业社党支部紧密结合实际，运用多种多样形式进行宣传鼓动工作的经验。这个社的宣传鼓动方式有政策问事处、广播台、黑板报、流动红旗、流动指标牌、田间鼓动、大字报、漫画、渔鼓、山歌、读报、收音会、月亮晚会等共十八种之多。这些形式生动活泼，花样翻新，很受群众欢迎。像政策问事处就被群众亲切地称之为“开心锁”。广播台每天早晨和傍晚对社员广播生产中的好坏事例，对推动生产很有作用。报纸的编者写了一段评论，建议其他地区仿效晓阳社的做法，让宣传鼓动工作在大跃进中放出奇光异彩。
    师范学院的革命措施
    山东师范学院最近采取了一项革命措施：全院师生轮流下乡兴办农业中学。3日大众日报对这件事作了报道。报道中说，该院师生在整风运动中政治思想觉悟有了提高，纷纷提出了“到农村去办农业中学”的要求。中共山东省委和山东省人民委员会对他们的要求给予了支持和鼓励，决定以临沂、菏泽两专区作为山东师范学院兴办农业中学的基地。现在该院正在紧张制定下乡规划。
