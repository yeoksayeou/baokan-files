    Strong People
    – With a Hammer and Steel Drill in Hand, They Can Hollow Out Iron Mountains.
    Yang Zheng
    Wang Yahuan and Wang Liucai, two telephone soldiers of the Seventh Company of a certain regiment – both members of the Communist Youth League – were together called “strong people” during the construction of a national defense highway.
    Wang Yahuan was only twenty-one years old. In the beginning, when starting the rock excavation work, everyone was unfamiliar with the fragmented rock operation, unable to exert their strength, and fingers were often smashed by the hammer. Therefore, no one could complete the daily quota of three cubic meters per person. Only one person could complete the quota: Wang Yahuan. The company commander called him over and asked him to talk about his experience.
    “I don't have any experience," Wang Yahuan said.
    "Then how do you achieve the quota?" the company commander asked.
    “Anyway, I just work hard…”
    The company commander suddenly understood. He picked up Wang Yahuan's left hand, pulled off his glove, and saw that his fingers were all bruised with purple blood, and his index finger was swollen like an eggplant.
    The company commander shook his head and said, "You have to rest starting tomorrow!"
    “No,” Wang Yahuan widened his eyes and said, “Company Commander, I can't rest. Resting for one day will mean three cubic meters less of stone!”
    “But, doesn't your hand hurt?”
      “It hurts, but I can persevere.”
    The company commander had no choice but to say kindly, “Keep working, but don’t just rely on brute force in the future, use your brain!”
    Wang Yahuan was enlightened by the company commander, and he earnestly began to look for tricks in his work, greatly improving his blasting techniques. At the end of the day's work, he did not rest, but continued to inspect every stone on the construction site, planning where to drill and blast tomorrow. A high degree of work enthusiasm and skill caused his workload to skyrocket. Now he can complete seventeen cubic meters of fourth to sixth-grade stone per day, almost equivalent to the workload of six people.
    Wang Liucai is one year younger than Wang Yahuan. While building the highway, he often recited these two lines of rhythmic talk: “Build the highway well to protect national defense, Socialism is guaranteed.” Once, he suffered from severe dysentery, had not eaten for two whole days, and had no strength at all, but he still struggled to go to the construction site. The medic wanted him to lie down, but he refused to listen. There was no other way but to call the company commander. The company commander said to Wang Liucai:
    “Go back and lie down!”
    Wang Liucai pleaded, “Company Commander, everyone is working, I don't want to lie down!”
    These two soldiers are such strong people. They were awarded the title of activist for their hard work and attended the team's activist conference. They were each awarded the Second Class Merit and the Third Class Merit respectively. (Attached image)

### 坚强的人——大锤钢钎握手中，铁山也能掏窟窿。

    坚强的人
    ——大锤钢钎握手中，铁山也能掏窟窿。
    阳政
    某团七连的两个电话兵——共青团员王亚环和王流财，在修建一条国防公路中，一齐被称为“坚强的人”。
    王亚环只有二十一岁。刚开始石方作业的时候，大家对有劲使不上的碎石作业都不熟练，锤子一落就砸坏指头。因此，谁也完成不了每人每天三立方的工作指标。能完成指标的只有一个人；那就是王亚环。连长把他找去，要他谈谈自己的经验。
    “我没有什么经验。”王亚环说。
    “那你是怎么达到指标的呢？”连长问。
    “反正我使劲干……”
    连长忽然明白了，拿起王亚环的左手，扯开手套，看见他的手指全都是青紫的淤血，食指肿得像一只茄子。
    连长摇了摇头说：“明天起你得休息！”
    “不，”王亚环瞪大双眼说：“连长同志，我不能休息，休息一天就要少出三立方石子呀！”
    “可是，你的手不痛吗？”
      “痛是痛，我能坚持。”
    连长只好亲切地说：“干吧，不过以后不要光凭蛮劲，要动脑子！”
    王亚环从连长那里得到了启示，在工作中认真的找起窍门来了，在放炮的技术上大大的提高了一步。一天的工程结束了，他并不休息，仍然在工地上察看每一块石头，计划明天应该在那个部位打眼放炮。高度的工作热忱和技术，使他的工作量扶摇直上。现在他一天就能完成四到六级石头的石方十七立方，差不多等于六个人的工作量。
    王流财比王亚环还小一岁。在修筑公路中，他经常念这样两句快板：“修好公路保国防，社会主义有保障。”有一次，他患了严重的痢疾，已经整整两天没有吃饭，浑身没有一点劲了，可是他还挣扎着到工地去。卫生员要他躺下来，他不听，没有办法，只好把连长找来。连长对王流财说：
    “快回去躺着！”
    王流财恳求地说：“连长同志，大家都干活，要我躺着，我不干！”
    这两位战士就是这样坚强的人。他们以刻苦的劳动获得了积极分子的称号，出席了团队的积极分子大会。并分别荣立二等功和三等功。（附图片）
