How Shanghai Supports Agricultural Production?
Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Realizing the National Agricultural Development Program is also the task of the working class and all departments in the city.

The National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) is the compass guiding all work in rural areas and a great program for socialist construction in China's countryside. The realization of this program will ensure a significant increase in China's agricultural productivity and guarantee that the lives of Chinese farmers will greatly surpass the level of wealthy middle peasants. At the same time, it will also vigorously promote the faster and smoother development of China's industry, enabling a steady and universal improvement in the lives of the people nationwide.

Our goal is to build China into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and advanced science and culture. Undoubtedly, industry is the leading force in the national economy, and heavy industry is the material foundation for socialist expanded reproduction and must be developed with priority. However, China is still a large agricultural country, with the rural population accounting for more than 80% of the national population. Agriculture occupies a very important position in China's national economy, with agricultural and sideline products accounting for nearly half of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Agriculture not only provides raw materials and markets for light industry but also serves as a significant market for many heavy industrial products. One of the important sources of China's export goods and capital accumulation is agriculture, and the food and clothing for 600 million people mainly come from agriculture. The speed of agricultural development and whether agriculture has a good harvest or a poor harvest affects the improvement of people's lives and, to a large extent, the development of the national economy. Therefore, how to treat the issue of developing agriculture has become a crucial issue in China's socialist construction. In his "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us on the issue of industrialization: "Economic construction in our country is centered on heavy industry, which must be affirmed. But at the same time, we must pay full attention to the development of agriculture and light industry." "The development of industry must go hand in hand with the development of agriculture. Only when industry has raw materials and markets can it accumulate more funds to establish a strong heavy industry." This instruction is entirely correct. It clearly defines the path of industrialization in our country and also dialectically explains the interrelationship between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture in China's economic construction. During the First Five-Year Plan, China has already realized agricultural cooperativization. Agricultural production has greatly developed. The total national agricultural output and the output of grain and cotton have completed or exceeded the state's planned targets, basically ensuring the needs of urban and rural people and the country, and avoiding the danger of agriculture being disconnected from industry. However, due to China's vast territory, some areas suffer from natural disasters every year. In addition, insufficient arable land and backward agricultural technology have limited the faster development of China's agriculture, thus lagging behind the needs of industry and the overall national construction. The proposal of the National Program for Agricultural Development is precisely to make agricultural production leap forward greatly and, in turn, promote the development of industry. The development of agriculture cannot be separated from the development of industry, because only with the active support of industry can the backward state of agriculture be changed. When agriculture develops and the lives of farmers improve, farmers will recognize the importance of the leadership of the working class and the unity of workers and peasants from their practical life experiences. On the other hand, the working class must educate the peasants with advanced ideology, help the peasants get rid of the influence of capitalism, and strengthen the confidence and determination of the broad masses of peasants to take the socialist road, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship on a new basis. Therefore, the realization of the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) has extremely important economic and political significance.

This relationship between industry and agriculture, city and countryside, is also very evident from Shanghai's perspective. Most of the raw materials needed by Shanghai's industry, except for some hardware equipment and chemical raw materials, come from agriculture. The quality of agricultural production has a great impact on Shanghai. The development of Shanghai's industrial production is inseparable from the growth of agricultural production and the support of Shanghai from various rural areas. For example, when cotton production decreased in 1954 and 1956, Shanghai's textile industry encountered great difficulties. The market for Shanghai's industrial products is mainly in the vast rural areas; at the same time, most of Shanghai's workers come from rural areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Increased or decreased agricultural production, and increased or decreased farmers' income, directly or indirectly affect the production mood and lives of the working masses. This illustrates that the development of industry and the development of agriculture are an inseparable whole of the national economy, and they are a relationship of mutual cooperation, mutual support, and mutual promotion. Therefore, the realization of the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) is not only a matter for rural areas, but also a matter for cities; it is not only the task of the broad masses of peasants and agricultural departments, but also the task of the working class and all departments in the city, and it is the common task of all Chinese people. We should take active action to vigorously support agricultural production and strive to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule.

Plan our work according to the requirements of the "Program" and the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan

Shanghai is one of China's important industrial bases, a city with a relatively high concentration of industry, commerce, culture, education, science, technology, and health services, and it has close ties with the vast rural areas of the country. In recent years, all departments in the city have been actively working to support agricultural production. In addition to producing a large number of industrial products to supply rural areas, they have also produced many agricultural machinery, pesticides, medicinal equipment, and a large number of water conservancy equipment and transportation tools directly related to agricultural production to support rural areas. Shanghai has also contributed to supporting flood prevention, drainage, drought resistance, and disaster relief in fraternal provinces and regions. 1958 is a year of great leaps forward in China's industrial and agricultural production. In order to welcome the new high tide of industrial production, we must obtain the support of the vast rural areas for Shanghai's industrial production. Therefore, we need to actively support agriculture even more. The new high tide of agricultural production and the new high tide of industrial production have already or are unfolding widely in a complementary manner. We should use the city's newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and other propaganda tools and various propaganda methods to vigorously strengthen the publicity of the realization of the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) to the city's employees and residents, introduce the new construction achievements and spiritual outlook in rural areas, and encourage the people of the city to actively support rural construction. We must make the people of the city understand the great significance of the country's simultaneous development of industry and agriculture on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. The task of our working class and the people of the city is to boost our energy, work hard to develop production, work actively, and strive for the upstream; resolutely implement the Party Central Committee's policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, helping farmers realize the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft), and build a new socialist countryside. We must educate and encourage family members living in rural areas to raise their awareness, strengthen unity within the cooperatives, actively engage in agricultural production, and not abandon agriculture and blindly flow into Shanghai. Every employee should strengthen close ties with farmers, and often use the working class's selfless and collectivist ideology to educate and influence the masses of farmers, establish a style of hard work and simplicity, and set an example for farmers. All employees and residents, whenever possible, have the responsibility to help agricultural production cooperatives politically, economically, and materially, and do their best to promote the consolidation and development of collectivization. All relevant departments in Shanghai should actively plan and carry out the work they should and can do, in accordance with the requirements of the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) and in conjunction with the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Actively Manufacture Agricultural Machinery, Pesticides and Light Industrial Products

(1) Under the unified arrangement of the Central Government, give full play to the power of industrial production and actively manufacture various agricultural machinery, pesticides, medicinal equipment, and light industrial products suitable for agriculture to supply rural areas. Because we are a country with less arable land and a large population, in recent years, in order to actively develop agricultural production, farmers have adopted measures such as reforming the farming system, increasing the multiple cropping index, deep plowing and meticulous farming, and increasing the output per unit area, which has greatly increased the amount of labor invested in the land, resulting in a shortage of manpower; the labor shortage is even more prominent during busy farming seasons. With the development of national industrialization, the gradual realization of agricultural mechanization in rural areas is an urgent requirement of the broad masses of farmers and a necessary measure to transform China's backward agricultural technology. Shanghai has a large machine manufacturing capacity and a relatively large scientific and technological force. It should use these favorable conditions, equip a certain number of mechanical and technical forces, establish agricultural machinery research institutions, strengthen economic cooperation with neighboring provinces and cities, and actively produce agricultural machinery suitable for local characteristics, such as rice transplanters, cultivators, harvesters, and feed cutters for paddy fields in the Jiangnan area. We must also manufacture industrial equipment for chemical fertilizers, equipment for water conservancy construction projects, small and medium-sized irrigation and drainage machinery, power machinery for power generation, and processing machinery for agricultural and sideline products. When agricultural machinery goes to the countryside, technology must go to the countryside together, so that farmers can learn technology and improve their technical level as soon as possible. Improving old-style farm tools and retrofitting existing new-style farm tools is also very important, and a certain technical force must be organized to carry it out.

The industrial sector should continue to improve the quality of pesticides and medicinal equipment, reduce costs, try out new varieties in large quantities, produce pesticides that are highly effective in killing insects and are welcomed by farmers, and easy-to-carry medicinal equipment, and establish a chemical fertilizer industry to produce chemical fertilizers. In order to supply the electricity needed for agricultural production, the power sector should cooperate with neighboring provinces and regions, and take measures such as peak load avoidance and communication of power grids to rationally allocate electricity, so as not to hinder industrial power consumption and to support agriculture. The light industry and handicraft industry sectors should actively produce various products that are cheap and of good quality to meet the growing production and living needs of the broad masses of farmers.

Expand the supply of fertilizers and feed

(2) Fully collect urban miscellaneous fertilizers in Shanghai and use by-products, leftovers, and waste materials of industrial products to expand and improve the supply of fertilizers and feed to rural areas. Shanghai has a large source of miscellaneous fertilizers, that is, the food industry, textile industry, leather industry, and aquatic products and other industries alone have more than 100 kinds of by-products and leftovers, waste materials, etc. that can be used as miscellaneous fertilizers. The sludge in ditches and rivers, as well as a large amount of garbage, can be used. In exploiting the potential of the city's sources of fertilizer and feed, agricultural, health, supply and marketing, transportation and other departments should closely cooperate. For example, in addition to paying attention to regular sanitation and cleaning work, the health department should use holiday habits every year to mobilize citizens to carry out large-scale sanitation and cleaning work to collect a large amount of fertilizer. The supply and marketing department should improve the organization and management of miscellaneous fertilizers, simplify procedures, and formulate reasonable selling prices and transportation prices. In short, all the usable fertilizer and feed sources in the city should be fully utilized, which can not only support agricultural production, but also benefit the city's cleanliness and hygiene.

The commercial sector guarantees urban supply on the premise of promoting and developing agricultural and sideline production

(3) The commercial sector should actively support agricultural and sideline production in all aspects and guarantee urban supply on the premise of promoting and developing agricultural and sideline production. Vigorously purchase agricultural and sideline products and correctly grasp the price policy to promote the development of production. The system, management methods, and distribution of purchasing points should facilitate farmers and be subject to the needs of production. Pay attention to cooperating with the development of mountainous areas and provide convenience and support in purchasing materials in mountainous areas. Process and reform agricultural and sideline products and small local and special products, actively organize exports, increase foreign exchange, and increase rural income. Actively establish non-staple food production bases, and provide support in terms of funds, technology, and opening up sales markets for products. Actively do a good job in the scheduling and transportation of agricultural and sideline products, organize the supply of goods to cities in a planned way, and build and expand cold storage warehouses to increase the capacity to purchase and improve the storage of agricultural and sideline products, and resolve the contradictions between production and sales and off-season and peak seasons. Supply rural production materials in time without missing the agricultural season. For the supply of consumer goods, based on the principle of taking both urban and rural areas into account, appropriately tighten urban sales on the premise of not affecting the consumption of urban people, and appropriately meet the growing needs of rural areas in neighboring provinces and regions. Do our best to expand the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. The free market must be strictly managed, not only to give play to its positive role in promoting the exchange of small local and special products between urban and rural areas, but also to prevent the growth of spontaneous capitalist forces.

The transportation department should give full play to its role as a link between urban and rural areas

(4) While ensuring that it does a good job in industrial and commercial support to rural areas, the transportation department should closely cooperate to give full play to its role as a link between urban and rural areas. Transport various materials from the city to the countryside in a timely manner; and also pay attention to transporting agricultural and sideline products such as livestock, aquatic products, and vegetables to the city quickly and in a timely manner. Improve consignment procedures to facilitate consignment by agricultural cooperatives; improve loading and unloading and storage methods to reduce damage to materials during transportation and storage; improve business management and effectively reduce costs and transportation prices. Dredge the waterways and ports of inland river shipping and develop urban and rural transportation. Improve postal and telecommunications work, deliver books, newspapers and magazines in a timely manner, and ensure the needs of the development of rural cultural undertakings.

The scientific, cultural, educational and health departments should also contribute to the development of agricultural production

(5) The scientific, educational, cultural, and health departments should also take active action to contribute their strength to the development of agricultural production. Scientific research should pay close attention to combining science and technology with farmers' production practices. For issues such as improving planting systems, farming methods, improving soil, experimenting and promoting good varieties, and protecting and breeding livestock, we should carefully summarize farmers' production experience and guide the improvement of agricultural production technology. Regularly carry out science popularization propaganda and education to the masses, do a good job in weather forecasting, and strengthen the prevention of natural disasters. The agricultural and educational departments should continue to run agricultural schools well, and train outstanding cooperative members with cultural knowledge and outstanding educated youth in society who have undergone physical labor exercises in a planned way to enhance the strength of agricultural technology. Universities, middle schools, and primary schools should all face workers and peasants, appropriately increase the curriculum of basic agricultural knowledge according to different situations, strengthen labor education, and organize students to participate in agricultural labor regularly, so that it becomes a regular system. The health department should train a large number of rural medical personnel and actively prevent and treat various diseases. The publishing and distribution departments should increase the variety of books suitable for rural needs, and strengthen the distribution and supply of books and periodicals and the work of reviewing books and periodicals. The theater troupes and film projection teams under the cultural department should take turns going to the countryside to perform for farmers and provide guidance for farmers' amateur cultural activities in order to carry out beneficial cultural and entertainment activities in rural areas.

Mobilize a large number of cadres to go to the mountains and the countryside

(6) Mobilizing a large number of cadres to go to the mountains and the countryside in accordance with the unified arrangement and the principle of comprehensive training is a major revolutionary measure. Resolutely implementing this measure can not only further strengthen the relationship between the Party and the masses, and train and cultivate a cadre team with class consciousness and business ability that can withstand risks, but also, because a large number of cadres go to the countryside and the mountains, it will play an active role in improving the cultural and knowledge level of farmers, and can greatly promote the faster realization of the National Program for Agricultural Development (Revised Draft) and accelerate socialist construction. We hope that all cadres who are sent down will earnestly study agricultural production technology, overcome the view of belittling physical labor, establish a fine style of hard work and simplicity, shift social atmosphere, and better implement the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily. Writers, journalists, theoretical educators, etc., should also go to the grassroots level in a planned way to participate in practical work and labor production, train and transform themselves, and better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. For social educated youth, those who can engage in agricultural production should also be mobilized in a planned way to participate in rural construction. Intellectuals must undergo labor training in order to cultivate a labor viewpoint and a mass viewpoint, so that physical labor and mental labor can be combined, and collective wisdom and individual talents can be combined, in order to better serve socialist construction.

    上海市怎样支援农业生产？
    中共上海市委书记　魏文伯
    实现农业发展纲要，也是工人阶级和城市各个部门的任务
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），是指导农村一切工作的南针，是我国农村社会主义建设的伟大纲领。实现这个纲领，将保证我国农业生产力的大大提高，保证我国农民生活大大超过富裕中农的水平；同时，也将有力地促进我国工业更加迅速、更加顺利地发展，使全国人民的生活能够稳步地普遍地改善。
    我们的奋斗目标是要把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和先进科学文化的社会主义强国。不容怀疑，工业是国民经济的领导力量，而重工业则是社会主义扩大再生产的物质基础，必须优先发展。但是，我国目前还是一个大农业国，农村人口占全国人口的80％以上，农业在我国国民经济中占有很重要的地位，农副业产品在工农业总产值中的比重接近一半。农业不仅为轻工业提供原料和市场，而且是许多重工业品的重要市场。我国出口物资和资金积累的重要来源之一是农业，六亿人民的衣食主要来源还是农业。农业发展的快慢，农业的丰收或歉收，影响到人民生活的改善，在很大程度上也影响到国民经济的发展。因而怎样对待发展农业的问题，就成为我国社会主义建设中的一个关键性的问题。毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”上所讲的工业化道路的问题中指示我们：“我国的经济建设是以重工业为中心，这一点必须肯定。但是同时必须充分注意发展农业和轻工业。”“发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举，工业才有原料和市场，才有可能为建立强大的重工业积累较多的资金。”这个指示是完全正确的，它明确地规定了我国工业化的道路，也辩证地说明了重工业、轻工业和农业在我国经济建设中的相互关系。在第一个五年计划期间，我国已经实现了农业合作化，农业生产有了很大的发展，全国农业总产量和粮食、棉花的产量已经完成或超过国家的计划指标，基本上保证了城乡人民和国家的需要，避免了农业与工业脱节的危险。但是，由于我国的幅员广大，每年有一些地区遭受自然灾害的侵袭，加之耕地不足，农业技术落后，限制了我国农业的更快发展，因而赶不上工业和整个国家建设发展的需要。全国农业发展纲要的提出，正是为了使农业生产大大地向前跃进一步，并反转来促进工业的发展。农业的发展也离不开工业的发展，因为只有工业的积极支援，才能改变农业的落后状态，农业发展了，农民生活改善了，农民就会从实际生活的体验中，认识到工人阶级领导和工农团结的重要。另一方面，工人阶级必须用先进的思想教育农民，帮助农民摆脱资本主义的影响，坚定广大农民走社会主义道路的信心和决心，在新的基础上巩固工农联盟，加强人民民主专政。由此可见，实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），有极其重要的经济意义和政治意义。
    这种工业与农业、城市与农村之间的关系，从上海来看，也很为明显。上海工业所需的原料，除了一部分五金器材、化学原料外，绝大部分来自农业，农业生产好坏对上海的影响很大。上海工业生产的发展，和农业生产的增长及各地农村对上海的支援是分不开的，例如1954年和1956年棉花减产，上海的纺织工业就遇到很大困难。上海工业产品的市场主要在广大农村；同时，上海的工人大多来自江、浙农村。农业增产或减产，农民收入的增加或减少，也都直接间接地影响到工人群众的生产情绪和工人的生活。这说明了发展工业与发展农业是国民经济的一个不可分割的整体，又是一种相互配合、相互支援和相互推动的关系。因此，实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），不仅是农村的事情，也是城市的事情，不仅是广大农民和农业部门的任务，也是工人阶级和城市各个部门的任务，也是全中国人民的共同任务。我们应当积极行动起来，大力支援农业生产，为提前实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）而斗争。
      根据“纲要”要求和第二个五年计划任务筹划自己的工作
    上海是我国重要的工业基地之一，是一个工商业和文教、科学、技术、卫生事业比较集中的城市，它和国内广大农村有着血肉相关的联系。几年来，全市各个部门对支援农业生产是积极努力的，除了生产大批工业用品供应农村外，还生产了许多和农业生产直接有关的农业机械、农药、药械和大批水利器材、运输工具等支援了农村。上海在支援兄弟省区的防汛、排涝、抗旱、救灾方面也贡献了一部分力量。1958年是我国工业生产与农业生产大跃进的一年。为了迎接工业生产的新高潮，我们必须取得广大农村对上海市工业的支援，因而我们更需要积极地支援农业，农业生产的新高潮和工业生产的新高潮已经或正在相辅相成地广泛展开。我们应该利用全市报刊杂志、广播电台等宣传工具和各种宣传方法，大力加强对全市职工和居民进行关于实现全国农业发展纲要
  （修正草案）的宣传，介绍农村中新的建设成就与精神面貌，鼓励全市人民积极支援农村建设。我们要使全市人民都懂得国家在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举的重大意义。我们工人阶级和全市人民的任务就是要鼓起干劲，努力发展生产，积极工作，力争上游；坚决贯彻执行党中央所提出的多快好省的勤俭建国的方针，帮助农民实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），建设社会主义的新农村。我们要教育和鼓励居住在农村的家属提高觉悟，在合作社内加强团结，积极从事农业生产，不要丢掉农业不干，盲目流到上海市里来。每个职工应加强与农民的亲密联系，经常以工人阶级的大公无私的、集体主义的思想来教育和影响农民群众，树立艰苦朴素的作风，给农民作榜样。所有职工群众和居民只要有可能，都有责任在政治上、经济上、物质上帮助农业生产合作社，尽力促进合作化的巩固和生产的发展。上海市各个有关部门应根据全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求，结合第二个五年计划的任务，积极筹划和进行自己应该做和能够做的工作。
      积极制造农业机械、农药和轻工业品
      （1）在中央统筹安排之下，充分运用工业生产的力量，积极制造各种适合农业的机械和农药、药械以及轻工业品供应农村。由于我们是个耕地少、人口多的国家，几年来，农民为了积极发展农业生产，采取了改革耕作制度，提高复种指数，深耕细作，提高单位面积产量等措施，大大增加了投入土地的劳动量，形成人力不足；在农事紧张的季节，劳动力缺乏的情况，更为突出。随着国家工业化的发展，在农村逐步实现农业机械化，已是广大农民的迫切要求，也是改造我国落后的农业技术的必要措施。上海有较大的机器制造能力，有较多的科学技术力量，应当运用这些有利条件，配备一定数量的机械和技术力量，成立农业机械的研究机构，加强同邻近各省市的经济协作，积极生产适合地方特点的农业机械，如江南地区水田用的插秧机、中耕机、收割机以及饲料切割机等。还要制造化学肥料的工业设备，水利建设工程的设备，中小型的灌溉、排水机械，发电用的动力机械和农副产品的加工机械等等。在农业机械下乡的时候，必须使技术一起下乡，让农民尽快地学会技术与提高技术水平。改良旧式农具和改装现有的新式农具也很重要，必须组织一定技术力量去进行。
    工业部门应该继续提高农药和药械的质量，降低成本，大量试制新的品种，生产杀虫效力大而为农民欢迎的农药和便于携带的药械，并建立化学肥料工业，生产化肥。为了供应农业生产用电的需要，电力部门应该和邻近的省区配合协作，采取负荷避峰，沟通电力网等措施合理调配电力，做到既不妨碍工业用电，又能支援农业。轻工业和手工业部门应该积极生产价廉物美的各种产品，满足广大农民日益增长的生产和生活的需要。
          扩大肥料和饲料供应
      （2）充分收集上海市的城市杂肥与利用工业品的副产品、下脚、废料，扩大和改善对农村的肥料和饲料供应。上海市杂肥来源很大，即以食品工业、纺织工业、皮革工业、水产等行业来说，就有一百多种副产品和下脚、废料等可以作为杂肥。沟渠、河道中的污泥，还有大量的垃圾，都可利用。在挖掘城市的肥料、饲料来源的潜力中，农业、卫生、供销、交通运输等部门应当密切配合。例如，卫生部门除注意经常性的卫生清扫工作外，每年应该利用节日习惯，发动市民进行大规模的卫生清扫工作，搜集大量肥料。供销部门应该改善杂肥的组织和经营工作，简化手续，制订合理的出售价格和运输价格。总之，把城市中一切可以利用的肥料、饲料来源全部充分地利用起来，既可支援农业生产，又有利于城市的清洁卫生。
      商业部门在促进和发展农副业生产的前提下，保证城市供应
      （3）商业部门应该从各方面积极支援农、副业生产，在促进和发展农、副业生产的前提下，保证城市供应。大力收购农、副业产品，正确地掌握价格政策，以利于促进生产的发展。收购工作的制度、经营方法、收购点的分布等，均应该便利农民和服从生产的需要。注意配合开发山区，在收购山区的物资方面给以方便和支持。对农、副产品和小土特产进行加工改制，积极组织出口，增加外汇，增加农村收入。积极建立副食品生产基地，并在资金、技术和开拓产品的销售市场方面给以支持。积极做好农、副产品的调度和运输工作，有计划地组织货源供应城市，并建设和扩大冷藏仓库，增加收购和提高存储农、副产品的能力，解决产销和淡旺季节的矛盾。不误农时地供应农村生产资料，对生活消费资料的供应，本着城乡兼顾的原则，在不影响城市人民的消费的前提下，适当紧缩城市销量，适当满足邻近省区的农村日益增长的需要。尽力扩大城乡物资交流，对于自由市场，必须严格的加以管理，既要发挥其畅通城乡小土特产交流的积极作用，又要防止资本主义自发势力滋长。
      交通运输部门应充分发挥联系城乡的纽带作用
      （4）在保证做好工业和商业方面对农村的支援的同时，交通运输部门应当密切配合充分发挥其联系城乡的纽带作用。将城市中的各项物资及时地运到农村去；对于农、副产品如牲畜、水产、蔬菜等运入城市，也应当注意迅速及时。改进托运手续，便利农业合作社托运；改进装卸保管方法，减少物资在运输和储存中的损坏；改善经营管理，切实降低成本和运输价格。疏浚内河航运的河道和港口，发展城乡的交通运输。改进邮电工作，及时投递书报杂志，保证农村文化事业发展的需要。
     科学文教卫生部门也要为发展农业生产贡献力量
      （5）科学、教育、文化、卫生部门也应该积极行动起来，为发展农业生产而贡献自己的力量。科学研究方面应该密切注意把科学技术和农民的生产实践结合起来，对改进种植制度、耕作方法、改良土壤、实验和推广优良品种、保护和繁殖牲畜等问题，应当认真总结农民的生产经验，指导农业生产技术的提高。经常向群众进行科学普及的宣传教育，做好气象预报，加强对自然灾害的预防工作。农业和教育部门应该继续办好农业学校，有计划地培养农业合作社的有文化知识的优秀社员和社会上经过体力劳动锻炼的优秀知识青年，增强农业技术的力量。大、中、小学校都应该面向工农，分别情况适当增加农业基本知识的课程，加强劳动教育，组织学生定期参加农业劳动，使之成为一种经常的制度。卫生部门应该大量培养农村医务人员，积极防治各种疾病。出版、发行部门应该增加适合农村需要的图书品种，并加强图书报刊的发行供应工作和书刊评介工作。文化部门所属的剧团、电影放映队应当轮流下乡为农民演出，对农民的业余文化活动进行辅导，以开展农村中有益的文化娱乐活动。
      动员大批干部上山下乡
      （6）根据统一安排，全面锻炼的方针，动员大批干部下乡上山，这是一个重大的革命措施。坚决贯彻这个措施，不仅可以更加密切党群关系，锻炼和培养一支有阶级觉悟和业务才能的、经得起风险的干部队伍，而且由于大批干部下乡上山，对提高农民的文化知识水平，将起积极作用，可以大大促进全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）更快地实现，加速社会主义建设。我们希望所有下放的干部认真学习农业生产技术，克服轻视体力劳动的观点，树立勤劳朴素的优良作风，转移社会风气，更好地贯彻勤俭建国的精神。作家、新闻工作者、理论教育工作者等，也应该有计划地到基层去参加实际工作和劳动生产，锻炼改造自己，更好地为工农兵服务。对于社会知识青年，凡能从事农业生产的，也应当有计划地动员他们去参加农村建设。知识分子必须经过劳动锻炼，才能培养起劳动观点和群众观点，使体力劳动和脑力劳动相结合，集体的智慧和个人的才能相结合，才能更好地为社会主义建设服务。
