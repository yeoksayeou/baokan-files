    From White Silk Fans to Exhibitions
    An elderly Ceylonese man named Abeysekera told me after visiting the Chinese Goods Exhibition Hall: More than 1,500 years ago, when Faxian lived in Ceylon, he saw a rare Chinese white silk fan and was reminded of China. He said that today, on Ceylonese soil, he not only saw extremely exquisite Chinese handicrafts and silk, but also the latest lathes, trucks, automatic textile machines, and printing presses that he had not known about before. He saw the full picture of the rapid development of the new China and the historical connection between China and Ceylon. Therefore, nothing could excite him more than today. As he spoke, the 69-year-old man took out the draft of his long comment prepared after his first two visits and neatly copied it into the exhibition hall's guest book.
    Abeysekera is one of the many enthusiastic visitors to the Chinese Exhibition Hall. During the entire exhibition period (March 18 to April 17), it attracted people like a magnet in the capital of this "Pearl of the Orient" surrounded by the blue sea. Every day, thousands upon thousands of visitors came to visit, leaving hundreds and thousands of compliments. Many people braved the heat, holding parasols and crowding in front of the stalls to buy silk, "China Parker" pens, and "chili sauce."
    The Ceylonese people's love for Chinese products has a history. According to historical records, as early as the second century AD, large Chinese and Arab ships loaded with goods and merchants traveled between China and Ceylon. For a long time, Ceylonese girls loved to wear clothes made of Chinese silk when they got married. However, Portugal, the Netherlands, and Britain successively plundered and occupied this beautiful "Gem Island" for four hundred years. From then on, its trade with Eastern countries, especially with China, could only become a beautiful memory….
    Sino-Ceylonese trade only had the possibility of recovery after the independence of the two countries, and it officially resumed in 1952. China and Ceylon signed the first five-year trade agreement for the exchange of rubber and rice. Last year, the two governments signed a second five-year trade agreement to expand trade, and also signed a Sino-Ceylonese economic assistance agreement. At this exhibition, many businessmen expressed their welcome to further expand trade between the two countries. They said that in recent years, Chinese rice has become a "household name" in Ceylon, but the Ceylonese people do not yet understand that China can produce such a rich and excellent range of other products. Through the exhibition, they have increased their understanding of China and believe that the two countries can further expand trade on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual exchange of goods.

    The Leaping Mirror
    When Ceylonese people meet Chinese people, they often happily mention the unprecedented welcome received by Premier Zhou Enlai during his visit here last year. People believe that the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Bandaranaike laid a solid foundation for the relationship between the two countries. Through this exhibition, the people of Ceylon have once again seen the concrete development and construction achievements of China in recent years. In the guest book, you will see many words praising China's rapid progress and the diligence and enthusiasm of the Chinese people. Some viewers believe that it is simply unimaginable that the Chinese people, who were starving and eating bark in the past due to imperialist exploitation and aggression, have achieved such great achievements in just eight years. When the audience saw the model of the Yangtze River Bridge and learned that the bridge stood almost as high as the high mountains of Ceylon, that the width of the bridge was the same as the widest street in Colombo, allowing six rows of cars to run side by side, and that the bridge project was completed two years ahead of schedule, they said: "This is truly a miracle." They wrote in the guest book: "I have never seen such a great bridge in any other country," "This is the great fruit of the hard work of the Chinese people," "Salute to the Chinese people."
    People are talking about China and its achievements on the streets, in shops, and on buses. A teacher told me that students are generally asking in class how China has achieved such great progress.
    There is a resounding sentence in the guest book: "The exhibition is a mirror of the rapid progress of the great Chinese people." The Chinese people, who are advancing by leaps and bounds, are creating ever-changing products with unprecedented enthusiasm for labor. For foreign friends, these products are precisely a "mirror of the leap forward" of the Chinese people.

      "Look to the East, Not to the West"
    The exhibition reflects the achievements of China, an ancient Eastern country, bringing joy and confidence to the Ceylonese people who are engaged in building their own country. A kind of Asian pride is growing in the hearts of the Ceylonese people. The guest book contains many such words: "As an Asian, I am proud of the achievements of the Chinese people," "I believe that China can surpass the Western industrial powers," "Western powers, which have always insulted Eastern countries as underdeveloped countries, should be taught a lesson." The two ministers of the Ceylonese Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Broadcasting and Propaganda both wrote their opinions after visiting the exhibition hall: Now is the time when people should "look to the East, not to the West."
    In conversations with many friends in the economic circles of Ceylon, the reporter deeply felt that the "thunder" of the American economic crisis that had spread across the Pacific Ocean brought anxiety to the Ceylonese people, who had suffered greatly from it. Mr. Dias, the secretary of a chamber of commerce here, told me that due to the recession in the United States, undercapacity operation, and the resulting surplus of rubber, the price of rubber on the world market has fallen, which has seriously affected the production and sales of Ceylon's rubber. Currently, in some parts of Ceylon, the cost price of one pound of rubber is 0.8 Ceylonese rupees, while the selling price is 0.75 Ceylonese rupees.
    Independent Ceylon is gradually getting rid of Western economic control and is trying to cope with the shadow of the economic crisis coming from the United States. It is strengthening its trade relations and economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, China, and Asian and African countries. A strong desire to "look to the East," trade with Eastern countries, and strengthen economic cooperation with Asian and African countries is spreading like a sea breeze on this island and is generally present in everyone's heart.

    跃进的镜子
    ——记中国商品在锡兰的展出
    高梁
    从白绢扇到展览会
    一位名叫阿比亚细卡拉的锡兰老人在参观中国商品展览馆后这样告诉我：一千五百多年以前，法显在锡兰居住时曾看到一幅稀有的中国白绢扇，因此思念起中国。他说，今天，在锡兰国土上他不仅看到极为精致的中国工艺品、丝绸，而且看到他过去所不知道的最新式的车床、卡车、自动纺织机、印刷机，他看到了新中国迅速发展的全貌和中锡两国的历史联系，因此，再没有什么能使他比今天更激动的了。说着，这位六十九岁的老人掏出他在前两次参观后准备好的长篇评语的底稿，把它工工整整地誊在展览馆的意见簿上。
    阿比亚细卡拉老人是许许多多参观中国展览馆的热情观众之一。在展览馆的整个展出期间（3月18日—4月17日），在这蓝色海洋环抱着的“东方珍珠”国的首都里，它像磁铁一样吸引着人们。每天有成千成万的观众前来参观，他们留下成百条成千条的赞语。许多人不顾炎热，打着遮阳伞挤在小卖部前争购丝绸、“中国派克”和“辣椒酱”。
    锡兰人热爱中国产品是有来历的。据历史记载，早在公元二世纪，中国和阿拉伯国家的艨艟大船就载运着货物和商人，来往于中锡两国之间。很久以来，锡兰姑娘们出嫁时爱穿中国丝绸做的衣裳。但四百年来葡萄牙、荷兰、英国相继掠夺和占领了这个美丽的“宝石岛”，从此，它同东方国家的贸易，尤其同中国的贸易，只能成为人们美好的回忆……。
    中锡贸易在两国独立后才有了恢复的可能，并且在1952年正式恢复。中锡两国订立了第一个橡胶大米交换的五年贸易协定。去年两国政府又签订了扩大贸易的第二个五年贸易协定，同时签订了中锡经济援助协定。在这次展览会上，许多商人都表示欢迎进一步扩大两国贸易。他们说，几年来，中国大米在锡兰已“家喻户晓”，但锡兰人还不了解中国能出产其他这样丰富优良的产品，通过展览会，他们增进了对中国的了解，并且相信两国可以更多地在平等互利、互通有无的基础上扩大贸易。
    跃进的镜子
    锡兰人见到中国人时，常常高兴地提起周恩来总理去年到这里访问时受到空前欢迎的事。人们认为，周恩来总理和班达拉奈克总理的会谈奠定了两国之间牢固的关系。通过这次展览，锡兰人民又看到中国近年来具体的发展和建设的成就。在留言簿上，你会看到许许多多赞扬中国的迅速进步和中国人民勤劳的热情的话。一些观众这样认为：过去因帝国主义剥削侵略而挨饿啃树皮的中国人，在短短八年内获得今天这么巨大的成就，简直是不可想像的。当观众看了长江大桥的模型，知道大桥竖起来几乎像锡兰的高山那般高，桥的宽度同科伦坡最宽的街道一样，可以六排汽车并行，大桥工程是在两年内提前完成的，他们说：“这真是奇迹”。他们在留言簿上写下这样的话：“我从没有在任何其他国家里看到有这样伟大的桥”，“这是中国人民辛勤劳动的伟大果实”，“向中国人民致敬”。
    人们在街道、商店和公共汽车上谈论着中国和它的成就。一位教员告诉我，学生们在课堂里普遍提出中国如何获得如此巨大进步的问题。
    在留言簿里有这样一句响亮的话：“展览会是伟大中国人民迅速前进的镜子”。乘风破浪、一日千里地跃进着的中国人民，正在以空前的劳动热情创造日新月异的产品。对外国朋友来说，这些产品正是中国人民“跃进的镜子”。
      “看东方，不看西方”
    展览会反映出中国这个古老东方国家的成就，给正在从事建设自己国家的锡兰人带来欢喜和信心。一种亚洲人的骄傲在锡兰人的心中生长。留言簿中写着许多这样的话：“作为亚洲人，我对中国人民的成就感到骄傲”，“我相信中国是能够赛过西方工业强国的”，“一向侮辱东方国家为未开发国家的西方列强，应当受到教训了”。锡兰内政部和广播宣传部两位部长在参观展览馆后都写下自己的意见：现在是人们应该“看东方、不看西方”的时候了。
    在同锡兰许多经济界的朋友们谈话中，记者深深感到，那越过太平洋而传来的美国经济危机的“雷鸣”，为饱受其害的锡兰人带来焦虑。代斯先生是这里一个商会的秘书，他曾向我谈到，由于美国生产衰退，开工不足，橡胶呈现过剩现象，世界市场价格下跌，因而严重地影响锡兰橡胶的生产和销售。目前锡兰有些地方，一磅橡胶的成本价格为锡兰币零点八卢比，而出售价格却是零点七五卢比。
    独立的锡兰正在逐渐摆脱西方对它的经济控制，并在设法应付从美国袭来的经济危机的阴影，它正在加强同苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、中国和亚非各国的贸易关系和经济合作。一种“看东方”、同东方国家进行贸易和同亚非国家加强经济合作的强烈愿望，像海风一样地在这个岛屿上散播着，并且正普遍在每人的心里。（附图片）
