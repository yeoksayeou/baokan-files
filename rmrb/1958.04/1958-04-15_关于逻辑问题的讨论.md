    Discussion on Logical Problems
    Ma Te
    In recent years, discussions in China's academic circles regarding logical problems have essentially involved two different and opposing viewpoints. These two different and opposing viewpoints ultimately represent two different academic lines.

    In the discussion of logical problems, issues can be summarized into the following three aspects: (1) Issues in formal logic; (2) Issues in dialectical logic; (3) The interrelationship between formal logic and dialectical logic.

    The fundamental issue in formal logic concerns the nature of this science, that is, whether formal logic is simply a tool for expressing argumentation without involving the understanding of reality, or whether it is both a tool for expressing argumentation and a method for understanding reality.

    This question is an old one in the history of logic, and it has been raised again in the current discussion. Zhou Gucheng and Wang Fangming, among others, represent the former view; Jiang Tianji, Shen Bingyuan, Ma Pei, and Ma Te, among others, represent the latter view.

    However, in the process of discussion, this fundamental issue has not been explicitly raised; people have only vaguely touched upon it from indirect aspects. For example, Zhou Gucheng believes that the task of formal logic "lies in deducing existing knowledge or understanding." "Whether the knowledge is true or not is the business of each subject; whether the deduction is correct or not is the business of formal logic." This means that formal logic only deals with expressing argumentation and does not deal with the understanding of reality. Wang Fangming completely separates deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning in the formal logic system, believing that only inductive reasoning has the function of understanding reality, while deductive reasoning does not.

    Those who hold the latter view believe that although there is a distinction between argumentation methods and recognition methods, there is also a connection, and the two are unified in formal logic. Argumentation is based on understanding; without understanding, there is no basis for argumentation. Separating understanding and argumentation will lead to the quagmire of formalism and idealism.

    Related to this fundamental issue are the objective basis of the laws of thought and the interrelationship between the correctness of the forms of thought and the truthfulness of the content of thought.

    Those who advocate that formal logic is simply a tool for expressing argumentation and does not involve the understanding of reality generally have two opinions regarding the objective basis of the laws of thought, and these two opinions are essentially the same. One opinion is that the laws of thought have no objective basis because they are the laws of thought, not the laws of existence. If one insists on seeking the objective basis of the laws of thought, it is to confuse the laws of thought with the laws of existence. This opinion is most prominently expressed by Zhou Gucheng and Zhu Fengjie. Wang Fangming's opinion is slightly different. He separates the laws of thought from the laws of logic, believing that the objective bases of the laws of thought and the laws of logic are different. Only the objective basis of the laws of thought is the relationship of objective external things, while the objective basis of the laws of logic is people's social constraints. Because, according to him, the laws of logic only deal with language and do not deal with objective things.

    Those who advocate that formal logic is both a tool for expressing argumentation and a method for understanding reality believe that although the laws of logic are different from the laws of existence, and the two cannot be confused, the laws of logic still have their objective basis and objective source. However, this objective basis is not people's social constraints, but the specific relationships of objective external things. Believing that people's social constraints are the objective basis of the laws of logic is actually denying that the laws of logic are a reflection of the relationships of objective external things in people's thinking, which violates the Marxist principle of reflection and is essentially a copy of conventionalism in modern bourgeois logic theory.

    In the issue of the interrelationship between the correctness of the forms of thought and the truthfulness of the content of thought, there are also two different views. One view is that formal logic only deals with the correctness of the forms of thought and does not deal with the truthfulness of the content of thought. Zhou Gucheng expresses this most resolutely and clearly. He believes that formal logic has no主張(zhǔzhāng) on any matter. It can serve correct主張(zhǔzhāng)s, and it can also serve wrong主張(zhǔzhāng)s.主張(zhǔzhāng)s can be right or wrong, but the論式(lùnshì)s derived from主張(zhǔzhāng)s can all be correct in themselves. Whether主張(zhǔzhāng)s are right or wrong depends on whether they conform to the facts, while whether論式(lùnshì)s are correct or not depends on whether they are self-contradictory.

    Another view is that although the correctness of the forms of thought and the truthfulness of the content of thought cannot be confused, the two are interconnected. Just like the interrelationship between artistic standards and political standards in literary works, there are differences and connections, but the two are unified. Separating correctness and truthfulness and completely opposing the two will lead to idealism and formalism. According to the dialectical materialist principle that content determines form, they believe that in the interrelationship between the two, truthfulness is the foundation because the correctness of the forms of thought is determined by the truthfulness of the content of thought. Ma Te, Jiang Tianji, Shen Bingyuan, and Ma Pei, among others, represent this view, although there are still minor differences in their arguments.

    In addition, there are also individuals (such as Li Zhicai) who hold another view. Li Zhicai's article ("The Role of Formal Logic in the Process of Cognition") published in the "Guangming Daily" basically leaned towards Zhou Gucheng's opinion, but it was not as clearly stated as Zhou Gucheng (his article was published before Zhou Gucheng's article). However, in his later article ("We Must Adhere to the Materialist Line in Logical Theory") published in "New Construction," he completely equated the correctness of the forms of thought with the truthfulness of the content of thought, as if truthfulness were correctness, and did not see that the two are related and yet different. Because the author himself is self-contradictory and lacks persuasiveness in his arguments, no one else has been seen agreeing with his views.

    Regarding the issue of dialectical logic, the main issue is the object of dialectical logic. This issue has not been seriously discussed, and it has mostly been touched upon when discussing the interrelationship between formal logic and dialectical logic. In the published papers and speeches at symposiums, there are roughly three different opinions on this issue. One opinion is that dialectical logic is the Marxist dialectical method, and the two terms are actually completely equal. Another opinion is that dialectical logic is the specific application of the Marxist dialectical method in the field of thought, but it gives a negative answer to the question of whether it also studies the structure of thought. Still another opinion is that dialectical logic is the specific application of the Marxist dialectical method in the field of thought, but it is different from the general Marxist dialectical method. It does not study the general laws of motion of thought, but only the special laws of motion of thought, that is, the dialectical relationship and laws of development of the structure and forms of thought. Those who hold this view believe that if dialectical logic does not study the structure and forms of thought, then it is not logic.

    In the issue of the interrelationship between formal logic and dialectical logic, there are mainly two different opinions. One opinion denies that formal logic and dialectical logic are in a primary and advanced relationship, but believes that the relationship between the two is the relationship between the Marxist worldview and specific sciences. Those who hold this view believe that dialectical logic is to formal logic, just as dialectical materialism is to psychology and linguistics. Zhou Gucheng and Wang Fangming represent this view. Wang Fangming further believes that if Engels had seen the development of modern logic, he would not have used elementary mathematics and higher mathematics to compare the relationship between formal logic and dialectical logic because, according to him, the relationship between elementary mathematics and higher mathematics is more appropriate to apply to the relationship between formal logic and mathematical logic.

    However, another group of people disagrees with this view. They believe that the above view, first, confuses the two concepts of dialectical materialism and dialectical logic. Only dialectical materialism is to formal logic in the relationship between worldview and specific science, while dialectical logic is to formal logic in the relationship between two specific sciences in the same series. Second, it cancels the direction of dialectical logic as an independent specific science, which in fact hinders the establishment and development of dialectical logic. Therefore, they believe that the views of Engels and Lenin have not become outdated, and the relationship between formal logic and dialectical logic is still like the relationship between elementary mathematics and higher mathematics.

    In addition, the discussion also touched on the question of whether dialectical thinking should follow the laws of formal logic and whether dialectical methods should be used in formal logic. Since the latter two questions have not been seriously discussed, I do not intend to introduce them here.

    In the process of discussion, the struggle between two different academic lines can be clearly seen. One academic line, on the grounds that Marxist-Leninist classical writers did not see the development of modern logic, rejects the instructions in Marxist-Leninist classical works concerning formal logic and dialectical logic and the interrelationship between the two, believing that Engels' and Lenin's theories on logic have become outdated. They deny the cognitive function of formal logic, deny the objective basis of the laws of thought, separate the unity of the correctness of thought and the truthfulness of content, replace Marxist logic theory with Kant's dualism and conventionalism in modern bourgeois logic theory, and declare that opposing idealism in logical problems is "metaphysics." It must be pointed out that this is a revisionist line in logical theory. It is revisionist because they also carry the banner of Marxism and smuggle idealism under the guise of opposing "metaphysics."

    Another academic line is: they adhere to the principles of Marxist logic theory, adhere to the principle of dialectical materialist reflection, emphasize the cognitive function of formal logic in thinking practice, emphasize the unity of argumentation methods and recognition methods in formal logic, they also emphasize the objective basis of the laws of thought, and oppose the absolute opposition of the correctness of the forms of thought and the truthfulness of the content of thought. However, this line is slandered as a "metaphysical" line. It must be pointed out that although the direction of this line is correct, it lacks sufficient persuasiveness in its arguments, lacks serious and painstaking research, and has problems of simplification and roughness in its analysis of problems, which gives the revisionist line in logical theory some excuses.

    In order to continue to expand the debate on logical problems, implement the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, and open up a broad road for logical research, I believe that: on the one hand, it is necessary to criticize the revisionist line in logical theory; on the other hand, it is necessary to conduct painstaking and systematic research based on the theories on logic in Marxist-Leninist classical works, and at the same time summarize the logical problems in various specific sciences, and conduct beneficial discussions on the basis of possessing a large amount of material. In this way, it will inevitably create the preconditions for a great leap forward in logical research.

    关于逻辑问题的讨论
    马特
    近年来我国学术界关于逻辑问题的讨论，基本上存在着两种不同的相反的看法。而这两种不同的相反的看法，归根到底表现着两种不同的学术路线。
    在逻辑问题讨论中，可以归结于如下三方面的问题：（1）形式逻辑方面的问题；（2）辩证逻辑方面的问题；（3）形式逻辑和辩证逻辑两者间的相互关系问题。
    形式逻辑方面的根本问题，是关于这门科学的性质问题，即形式逻辑是单纯的表述论证的工具、而并不关涉到对现实的认识，还是它既是表述论证的工具、又是认识现实的方法的问题。
    这个问题，在逻辑史上是个老问题，在现在的讨论中又重新提出来了。代表前一种意见的，有周谷城和王方名等人；代表后一种意见的，有江天骥、沈秉元、马佩和马特等人。
    但是，在讨论过程中，这个带根本性的问题并没有明确地提出来，人们只是隐约地从间接方面接触到这个问题。例如，周谷城认为：形式逻辑“的任务重在推论已有的认识或了解”。“认识的真不真，是各科的事；推论的错不错，是形式逻辑的事”。这就是说，形式逻辑只管表述论证，不管对现实的认识。王方名则把形式逻辑系统中的演绎推理和归纳推理完全分开，认为只有归纳推理才有认识现实的作用，演绎推理则没有这个作用。
    持后一种看法的人则认为：论证方法和认识方法虽然有区别，但是又有联系，这两者在形式逻辑中是统一的。论证以认识为依据，离开认识便无从论证。割裂认识和论证，便要陷于形式主义和唯心主义的泥坑。
    和这个根本问题相联系的，还有思维规律的客观基础以及思维形式的正确性和思维内容的真实性的相互关系问题。
    主张形式逻辑是单纯的表述论证的工具、而并不关涉到对现实的认识的人们，对于思维规律的客观基础问题，大体上有两种意见，这两种意见，实质上是相同的。一种意见认为思维规律没有客观基础，因为它是思维的规律，而不是存在的规律，如果硬要找寻思维规律的客观基础，那就是把思维规律和存在规律相混同。这种意见以周谷城和朱丰杰表现得最为突出。王方名的意见稍有不同，他把思维规律和逻辑规律割裂开来，认为思维规律和逻辑规律的客观基础是不相同的。只有思维规律的客观基础才是客观外界事物的关系，而逻辑规律的客观基础则是人们的社会制约性。因为照他看来，逻辑规律只和语言打交道，而并不和客观事物打交道。
    主张形式逻辑既是表述论证的工具又是认识现实的方法的人们，则认为逻辑规律虽然不同于存在规律，不能把两者混为一谈，但是逻辑规律仍然有它的客观基础、客观来源。但是这个客观基础不是人们的社会制约性，而是客观外界事物的特定关系。认为人们的社会制约性是逻辑规律的客观基础，实际上就是否认逻辑规律是客观外界事物关系在人的思维中的反映，这是违反马克思主义的反映论原理的，而实质上这是现代资产阶级逻辑理论中约定论的翻版。
    在思维形式的正确性和思维内容的真实性的相互关系问题方面，也存在着两种不同的见解。一种见解认为形式逻辑只管思维形式的正确性，而不管思维内容的真实性。在这方面，表示得最坚决、最明确的是周谷城。他认为形式逻辑对任何事物都没有主张。它可以为正确的主张服务，也可以为错误的主张服务。主张有对的和不对的，但是依主张所演出的论式，其自身却可以都是正确的。主张的对和不对，要看它和事实符合不符合；而论式的正确与否，却要看它自身前后矛盾不矛盾。
    另一种见解则认为思维形式的正确性和思维内容的真实性虽然不能混为一谈，但是两者是互相联系的。正如文学作品中的艺术标准和政治标准的相互关系一样，有区别也有联系，但是二者是统一的。割裂正确性和真实性，把两者完全对立起来，就要导致唯心主义和形式主义。根据内容决定形式的辩证唯物主义原理，他们认为：在两者的相互关系中，真实性是基础，因为思维形式的正确性以思维内容的真实性为决定条件。代表这方面的意见的有马特、江天骥、沈秉元、马佩等人，虽然他们之间在论证上仍然还有细小的分歧。
    此外，还有个别的人（例如李志才）持另外一种看法。李志才在“光明日报”发表的文章（“形式逻辑在认识过程中的作用”）中，基本上倾向于周谷城的意见，只是没有周谷城提得这样明确（他的文章发表在周谷城的文章之前）。但是，在他后来发表在“新建设”的文章（“必须坚持逻辑理论中的唯物主义路线”）中，却又把思维形式的正确性和思维内容的真实性完全等同起来，似乎真实性就是正确性，没有看出这两者虽有联系又有区别。由于作者本人前后矛盾，论证上也缺乏说服力，所以还没有看到别的人同意他的看法。
    关于辩证逻辑方面的问题，主要是关于辩证逻辑的对象问题，这个问题实际上还没有认真地展开讨论，多半只在讨论形式逻辑和辩证逻辑的相互关系问题时接触到一些。在已经发表了的论文和座谈会上的发言中，关于这个问题，大约有三种不同的意见。一种意见认为辩证逻辑就是马克思主义的辩证方法，这两个词实际上是完全相等的。另一种意见则认为辩证逻辑乃是马克思主义的辩证方法在思维领域的具体运用，而对它是否也研究思想结构这个问题却作否定的答复。此外还有一种意见则认为：辩证逻辑是马克思主义辩证方法在思维领域的具体运用，但是它不同于一般的马克思主义辩证方法，它并不研究思维的一般运动规律，而只研究思维的特殊运动规律，即思想结构和形式的辩证关系和发展规律。持这种见解的人认为：如果辩证逻辑并不研究思想结构和形式，那末它就不是逻辑。
    在形式逻辑和辩证逻辑相互关系问题中，主要有两种不同的意见。一种意见否认形式逻辑和辩证逻辑是初级和高级的关系，而认为这两者的关系乃是马克思主义世界观和具体科学的关系。持这种见解的人认为：辩证逻辑对于形式逻辑，正如辩证唯物主义对于心理学、语言学的关系是完全一样的。主张这种见解的以周谷城和王方名为代表。王方名还进一步地认为：如果恩格斯看到了现代逻辑的发展，他就不会用初等数学和高等数学来譬比形式逻辑和辩证逻辑的关系，因为照他看来，初等数学和高等数学的关系，应用到形式逻辑和数理逻辑之间的关系方面来，是更恰当的。
    但是，另外有一部分人不同意这种看法，他们认为上述见解，第一，混淆了辩证唯物主义和辩证逻辑这两个概念，只有辩证唯物主义对于形式逻辑，才是世界观和具体科学的关系，而辩证逻辑对形式逻辑，则是两门同一系列的具体科学间的关系。第二，取消了辩证逻辑作为一门独立的具体科学来研究的方向，这实际上就要阻碍对辩证逻辑的建立和发展。因此，他们认为：恩格斯和列宁的见解并没有过时，形式逻辑和辩证逻辑的关系，仍然是如同初等数学和高等数学之间的关系。
    此外，在讨论中，还接触到辩证思维要不要遵守形式逻辑的规律，以及在形式逻辑中要不要运用辩证方法的问题。由于后两个问题还没有展开认真的讨论，这里不打算作介绍了。
    在讨论过程中，可以很清楚地看出两条不同的学术路线的斗争。一条学术路线以马克思列宁主义经典著作家没有看到现代逻辑的发展为理由，拒绝马克思列宁主义经典著作中有关形式逻辑和辩证逻辑以及两者间的相互关系的指示，认为恩格斯和列宁关于逻辑方面的理论已经过时了。他们否认形式逻辑的认识作用，否认思维规律的客观基础，割裂思维正确性和真实性的统一，用康德的二元论和现代资产阶级逻辑理论中的约定论来代替马克思主义的逻辑理论，并宣布在逻辑问题中反对唯心主义乃是“形而上学”。必须指出，这是一条逻辑理论中的修正主义路线。其之所以是修正主义，是因为他们也打着马克思主义的旗号，在反对“形而上学”的借口下偷运唯心主义。
    另一条学术路线是：他们坚持马克思主义逻辑理论的原则，坚持辩证唯物主义反映论的原则，强调形式逻辑在思维实践中的认识作用，强调在形式逻辑中论证方法和认识方法的统一，他们还强调思维规律的客观基础，反对把思维形式的正确性和思维内容的真实性绝对地对立起来。但是，这条路线却被诬蔑为“形而上学”的路线。必须指出，这条路线，方向虽然是正确的，但是在论证上还缺乏足够的说服力量，还缺乏认真的刻苦的研究，对问题的分析还有简单化、粗糙化的毛病，这就给逻辑理论中的修正主义路线找到一些借口。
    为了继续展开逻辑问题的争论，贯彻百家争鸣的方针，给逻辑研究打开一条康庄大道，我认为：一方面，必须对逻辑理论中的修正主义路线进行批判；另一方面，必须依据马克思列宁主义经典著作中有关逻辑的理论进行刻苦的系统的研究，同时在各门具体科学中有关逻辑的问题进行概括，在占有大量材料的基础上进行有益的讨论。这样，就必然会给逻辑研究造成大跃进的前提条件。
