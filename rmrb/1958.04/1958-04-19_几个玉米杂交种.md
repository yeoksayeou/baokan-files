Several Corn Hybrid Varieties

According to statistics from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences' Maize Professional Conference, corn breeders and farmer breeders across the country have actively created and selected ninety-seven intervarietal hybrid corn varieties. These are distributed across different corn-producing regions nationwide. Among them, fifty-one have been widely planted or have begun demonstration and promotion, while forty-six are still undergoing demonstration trials in various locations. Several hybrid varieties are selected and introduced below:

Chunza No. 1 is an intervarietal hybrid of "Golden Queen" (father parent) and "Huanong No. 1" (mother parent). This hybrid corn has yellow kernels, and the quality is better than Golden Queen. Flour yield is 85.7%, and the thousand-kernel weight is large. The growing season is 120 to 125 days in Beijing. This hybrid yields more than 30% higher than local varieties in Beijing and can yield 15% higher in Guangxi (as "Pinza No. 1" at the Liuzhou experimental station).

Fangza No. 2 is a hybrid of "Golden Queen" (father parent) and "Small Grain Red" (mother parent). The stalks are relatively tall, kernels are yellow, mostly flinty, and the quality is medium. The growing season is 95 days, suitable for summer planting in most parts of Shandong Province, southern and central Hebei, and northern Jiangsu. Fangza No. 2 prefers abundant fertilizer and water and is best planted in irrigated and fertilized fields.

Qiyu No. 24 is an intervarietal hybrid of "Andong Huangmaya No. 11" (father parent) and "Small Grain Red" (mother parent). It is relatively drought-resistant, with a growing season of 90 to 95 days, suitable for summer planting (early planting should be expedited when used as wheat stubble corn). The adapted region is the same as "Fangza No. 2," and the two can be planted simultaneously in the same natural area, separately on fertile and infertile land.

Shijiao No. 1 is an intervarietal hybrid of "Jia 969" (father parent) and "Huanong No. 2" (mother parent). It has high yield (14%—140% higher than local varieties), 200% higher yield than "Huanong No. 2," strong disease and insect resistance, and prefers fertilizer. Thousand-kernel weight is 236 grams, quality is good, and the growing season is 92 days. It has been planted in Shijiazhuang, Hengshui, Cangxian, and other places in Hebei Province.

Baiza No. 1 was selected from 1950 to 1953, with "Huanong No. 2" as the mother parent and "Wei 416" as the father parent. It is a summer-sown variety with a growing season of about 85 days, strong disease resistance, and is not prone to lodging. The ears are cylindrical, kernels are reddish-yellow, shiny, and of good quality. It yields 30%—57% higher than local farmers' varieties and has been promoted in some counties in Henan Province.

Luza No. 1 is a hybrid of "Golden Queen" (mother parent) and local corn (father parent). This hybrid yields 14.7% higher than local farmers' varieties and not only has high yield but also good quality. "Luza No. 1" has a growing season of 130 days and is a spring-sown variety, suitable for planting in the southeastern region of Shanxi Province, such as Luan and Changzhi.

"Jinghui No. 50," "Huaiza No. 1," "Jingxi No. 1," and "Fengza No. 1" are also better hybrid varieties suitable for planting in parts of Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Guangxi, and Liaoning provinces, respectively.

    几个玉米杂交种
    据农业科学院玉米专业会议上的统计，全国玉米育种工作者和农民育种家积极创造选配的玉米品种间杂交种有九十七个，分布在全国各个不同的玉米产区，其中五十一个已大面积种植或开始示范推广，四十六个仍在各地继续示范试验。现在选择几个杂交种介绍在下面：
    春杂1号是“金皇后”（父本）和“华农1号”（母本）的品种间杂交种。这个杂交种玉米，粒黄色，品质比金皇后好，出粉率85.7％，千粒重大，在北京生育期一百二十天到一百二十五天。这个杂交种在北京比当地种增产30％以上，在广西（柳州试验站的“品杂1号”）可增产15％。
    坊杂2号是“金皇后”（父本）和“小粒红”（母本）的杂交种。茎秆比较高大，粒色黄，大部分是硬粒型，品质中等，生长期为九十五天，适于山东省大部地区和河北中南部与江苏北部夏播栽培。坊杂2号喜粪大、水足，最好种在水浇肥地里。
    齐玉24号是安东“黄马牙11号”（父本）和“小粒红”（母本）的品种间杂交种。比较耐旱，生长期为九十到九十五天，宜夏播（用作麦茬玉米时宜抓紧早播）。适应地区和“坊杂2号”相同，两者可以同时在一个自然区内分别种在肥沃的地和不肥沃的土地上。
    石交1号是“加969”（父本）和“华农2号”（母本）的品种间杂交种。产量高（比较当地种增产14％—140％），比“华农2号”增产200％，抗病、抗虫力强，喜肥。千粒重二百三十六克，品质好，生育期九十二天，已在河北省石家庄、衡水、沧县等地种植。
    百杂1号是于1950—1953年选成，母本“华农2号”，父本是“威416号”，是夏播种，生育期八十五天左右，抗病力强，不易倒伏，果穗圆柱形，粒红黄色，有光泽，品质好，较当地农家种增产30％—57％，已在河南省一些县推广。
    潞杂1号是“金皇后”（母本），和土玉米（父本）杂交成的。这个杂交种比当地农家品种增产14.7％，不但产量高，而且品质好。“潞杂1号”生育期一百三十天，是春播种，适于山西省东南地区潞安、长治等地种植。
    “泾惠50号”、“淮杂1号”、“靖西1号”、“凤杂1号”也是分别适宜在陕西、江苏、广西、辽宁四省部分地区种植的较好的杂交种。
