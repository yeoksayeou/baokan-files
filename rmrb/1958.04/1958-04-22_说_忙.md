Speaking of "Busyness"
He Mingjiang

Those who are engaged in the revolutionary cause are all busy, because the situation is pressing. If we are not busy, how can we realize those magnificent plans? Therefore, our "busyness" is entirely a phenomenon of thriving and vigorous progress.

However, the "busyness" of some leading comrades in some institutions has other reasons. For example, when some comrades examine their "five airs and three styles," they say that an important reason for these shortcomings is "busyness": Because of "busyness," they usually have little contact with the masses—bureaucratic air; because of "busyness," they have no time to conduct political theory study, their political sense declines, and they cannot keep up with the development of the situation—senile air; because of "busyness," they do not understand the enthusiasm of the masses and are timid in their work—conservatism; because of "busyness," they have no time to check the work situation, do not understand the work, and cause losses to the state—waste. In a word, it's all because of "busyness."

I disagree with this analysis. I think the reason they are busy is precisely because they do not go deep among the masses and do not check their work. Generally, leading comrades are busy with the following three points: First, busy with meetings. Busy attending meetings of their own units, busy attending meetings convened by higher authorities, although some of these meetings are often: "Meetings without discussion, discussion without decisions, decisions without implementation." But meetings are always indispensable. Second, busy listening to reports. This place, that place; this department, that department; the Party, the Youth League, the trade union... reports come like snowflakes, it is impossible not to be busy reading them, and it is impossible not to read them, because they must also be reported to the higher authorities. Third, busy giving reports. Usually, ideological work is not tightly grasped, and only when problems are discovered, they rush to give reports for education. To give a report, they must write a speech, and they must have "materials," so the secretary, director, section chief... also become busy!

From the above situation, it is not difficult for us to find ways to avoid busyness, that is, to go deep among the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and believe in the masses. Going deep among the masses and sharing weal and woe with the masses will naturally eliminate bureaucratic airs; relying on the masses, letting the masses do what they can do, and using the creativity of the masses will naturally eliminate conservatism or arrogance; mobilizing the masses, greatly improving everyone's enthusiasm, and making production leap forward, leading to leaders being encouraged by the power of the masses will naturally eliminate senile or resentful airs; believing in the masses, discovering and solving problems in work and ideological problems of the masses at any time, allowing leaders to take more time to unify planning and grasp the overall situation, so that a thriving and vigorous phenomenon will appear throughout the country.

Therefore, for those few leading comrades, being divorced from the masses is the root cause of "busyness."

### 说“忙”

    说“忙”
    何明江
    干革命事业的人，没有不忙的，因为形势逼人，不忙，怎么能实现那些宏伟的计划呢？所以我们的“忙”完全是一种蒸蒸日上、朝气勃勃的现象。
    不过，有些机关的领导同志的“忙”却有另外的原因。比如有些同志在检查自己的五气三风时，说所以会产生这些缺点，其中很重要一个原因就是“忙”：由于“忙”，所以平常接近群众少——官气；由于“忙”，所以自己没时间进行政治理论学习，政治嗅觉衰退，赶不上形势的发展——暮气；由于“忙”，不了解群众的干劲，在工作上缩手缩脚——保守；由于“忙”，所以没时间去检查工作情况，对工作不摸底，给国家造成损失——浪费。一言以敝之，都是因为“忙”。
    我不同意这种分析。我认为他们之所以忙，正是由于不深入群众、不检查工作的原故。一般领导同志忙的无非是以下三点：一，开会忙。忙着出席本单位的会议，忙着出席上级召开的会议，尽管这些会议中有些常常是：“会而不议，议而不决，决而不行。”但会总是少不得的。二，听汇报忙。这处，那处；这科，那科；党、团、工会……汇报如雪片飞来，不忙就看不完，看不完就不行，因为还要向上级汇报呢。三，作报告忙。平常对思想工作抓得不紧，直到发现了问题，才匆匆赶着作报告进行教育，要作报告，就必须写讲演稿，就必须要“材料”，于是秘书，处长，科长……也跟着忙起来！
    从以上情况看，我们不难找出避免忙的办法，那就是深入群众，依靠群众，发动群众，相信群众。深入了群众，和群众同甘共苦，这样自然就不会再有官气；依靠了群众，能让群众办的就让群众去办，利用了众人的创造性，这样自然就不会保守或产生骄气；发动了群众，大家积极性空前提高，生产突飞猛进，领导为群众力量所鼓舞，这样自然就不会再有暮气或怨气；相信了群众，工作中的问题和群众的思想问题随时发现随时解决，领导抽出更多的时间去统一规划，掌握全局，这样，一种欣欣向荣、朝气勃勃的现象便会在全国出现。
    因此，对那些少数领导同志来说，脱离群众，正是“忙”的根源。
