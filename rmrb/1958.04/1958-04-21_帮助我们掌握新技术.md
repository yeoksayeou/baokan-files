Reading the news in the People's Daily on March 29th about the successful research of the "friction welding method" by the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, we were very excited. This is because we urgently need this new technology to solve difficulties in production. In the Great Leap Forward in production, we plan to manufacture an X-ray crystal structure analysis device. Because the supply of the raw material, metallic beryllium, is insufficient, we want to use aluminum foil instead of beryllium. However, we do not know how to weld aluminum foil to metal. Now that the "friction welding method" has been successfully researched, it provides us with an effective way to solve the difficulties. In addition to thanking the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, we also hope that they will help us learn this advanced technology.

    帮助我们掌握新技术
    看到3月29日人民日报登载冶金工业部建筑科学研究院研究“摩擦焊接法”成功的消息后，我们非常兴奋。因为我们急需这种新技术来解决生产中的困难。在生产大跃进中，我们打算制造X线晶体结构分析装置，因为原材料金属铍供应不足，我们想用铝薄代替铍，但是我们不会把铝薄和金属焊接起来。现在“摩擦焊接法”研究成功，给我们提供了解决困难的有效办法，我们除了感谢冶金工业部建筑科学研究院之外，还希望他们帮助我们学会这一先进技术。
