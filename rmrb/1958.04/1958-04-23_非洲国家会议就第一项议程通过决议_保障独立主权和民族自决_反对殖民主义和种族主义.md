Xinhua News Agency, Accra, April 21st. The African Independent States Conference today adopted several resolutions regarding the first agenda item. These resolutions are: Resolution on Foreign Policy; Resolution on Steps to Safeguard the Independence, Sovereignty, and Territorial Integrity of African Independent States; Resolution on Racism; Resolution on the Future of Non-Independent Territories in Africa; Resolution on French-administered Togoland; and Resolution on French-administered Cameroon.

    The closing session of the African Independent States Conference is scheduled to be held on the 22nd.

    Basic Principles of Foreign Policy
    The resolution on foreign policy states: The conference, after exchanging views very broadly on various aspects of foreign policy,

    After reaching a consensus on various basic goals and principles,

    Due to the desire to pursue a common foreign policy in order to safeguard the hard-won independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the participating countries,

    Regretting the division of most parts of the world into two opposing blocs, therefore

    (I) Declares the following basic principles:
      (A) Firmly and unwavering loyalty to and support for the Charter of the United Nations, and respect for the resolutions of the United Nations,
      (B) Adherence to the Ten Principles declared at the Bandung Conference;
    (II) Declares that the conference is convinced that the governments of all participating countries should avoid undertaking obligations to take any actions that may involve them in a whirlpool and harm their interests and freedom;
    (III) Believes that as long as a fundamentally consistent view can be maintained on foreign policy, African independent states will be able to promote the unique character of Africa, and, in cooperation with other peace-loving countries, issue a united call for peace in the United Nations and other international forums.

    The Independence of African Independent States is Inviolable
    The resolution on steps to safeguard the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of African independent states states:

    The conference declares that the governments of all participating countries are determined to:

    A. Respect each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity;
    B. Cooperate with each other to safeguard their independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity;
    C. Cooperate with each other in their economic, technical, and scientific development, and in improving the living standards of their respective peoples;
    D. Resolve their differences through direct negotiations, with mediation or arbitration by other African independent states if necessary.

    The conference also condemns all forms of foreign interference that attempt to undermine the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of African independent states.

    Eradicate Racial Discrimination and Apartheid
    The resolution on racism states: The conference, considering that racial discrimination and apartheid are evil and inhumane practices;

    Firmly believes that racism seriously negates the basic principles of human rights and human dignity, and is therefore becoming a very dangerous factor, spreading harmful influences more and more widely in some parts of Africa, so that it is very likely to involve this continent in violence and bloodshed;

    Notes with disgust the recent remarks made by the head of the South African government upon his re-election regarding his policy of pursuing more brutal discrimination and persecution against colored people in South Africa; therefore

    1. Condemns all aspects of racial discrimination and apartheid practices throughout the world, especially in the Union of South Africa, the Federation of Central Africa, Kenya, and other regions of Africa;
    2. Calls on religious groups and religious leaders around the world to support all efforts to eradicate racism and apartheid;
    3. Requests all member states of the United Nations and all peoples of the world to support the resolutions passed by the United Nations and the Bandung Conference condemning such inhumane practices;
    4. Requests all member states of the United Nations to intensify their efforts to oppose and eradicate this degenerate injustice;
    5. Recommends that all governments of participating countries take vigorous measures to eradicate traces of racial discrimination that may appear in their own countries.

    Let Non-Independent Territories Achieve Independence
    The resolution on the future of non-independent territories in Africa declares that the issue and future of non-independent territories in Africa is not only a matter for colonial countries, but also a responsibility of all member states of the United Nations, especially African independent states.

    The resolution requires that a clear date for achieving independence be set for each non-independent territory, according to the will of the people of the non-independent territories and the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The resolution puts forward the following requirements and recommendations:

    1. The administering powers shall respect the Charter of the United Nations in this regard, and promptly take steps to implement the provisions of the Charter and the political aspirations of the people, namely self-determination and independence, according to the will of the people;
    2. The administering powers shall not implement repression and arbitrary rule in these non-independent territories, and shall respect all human rights stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;
    3. The administering powers shall immediately cease all forms of discrimination in these non-independent territories;
    4. All governments of participating countries shall do everything possible to assist the people of non-independent territories in their struggle for self-determination and independence;
    5. The African Independent States Conference shall provide training and education facilities for the people of non-independent territories;
    6. Decides to commemorate April 15 of each year as African Freedom Day.

    The resolution condemns any form of colonialism as a threat to the security and independence of African countries and to world peace.

    Togolese Elections Must Be Fair and Democratic
    In its resolution on French-administered Togoland, the conference expressed serious concern about the current election laws and systems in this area, and firmly requested the administering authorities to fully cooperate with the United Nations Commissioner to ensure fair and democratic elections in this area.

    France Should Negotiate with Cameroon
    In its resolution on French-administered Cameroon, the conference condemned the use of military force against unarmed people in the French-administered Cameroonian trust territory, believing that this violated the spirit of the United Nations; demanded that the administering power abide by the Charter of the United Nations and conduct direct negotiations with representatives of the people to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the people; and called on the United Nations to intensify its efforts to help the Cameroonian people realize their legitimate political aspirations.

    非洲国家会议就第一项议程通过决议
    保障独立主权和民族自决  反对殖民主义和种族主义
    据新华社阿克拉21日电　非洲独立国家会议今天通过了关于第一项议程的几项决议。这些决议是：关于外交政策的决议；关于保障非洲独立国家的独立、主权和领土完整的步骤的决议；关于种族主义的决议；关于非洲未独立地方前途的决议；关于法国管理的多哥的决议和关于法国管理的喀麦隆的决议。
    非洲独立国家会议的闭幕会议预定在22日举行。
    外交政策的基本原则
    关于外交政策的决议说：会议在就外交政策的各个方面非常广泛地交换意见之后，
    在对各种基本目标和原则取得了一致的意见之后，
    由于希望奉行一项共同的外交政策，以便保障与会国家得来不易的独立、主权和领土完整，
    由于对世界大部分地区分割为两个对立的集团感到遗憾，因此
    （一）申明下列各项基本原则：

      （乙）恪守万隆会议宣布的十项原则；
      （二）申明会议确信所有与会国家的政府都应该避免承担义务来采取任何可能把它们卷入旋涡而有害于它们的利益和自由的行动；
      （三）相信只要在外交政策方面能够保持根本一致的观点，非洲独立国家将能发扬非洲特有的性格，在其它爱好和平国家的合作下，在联合国和其它国际论坛上为了和平发出一致的呼声。非洲独立国家不可侵犯
    关于保障非洲独立国家的独立、主权和领土完整的步骤的决议说：

    会议还谴责企图破坏非洲独立国家的独立、主权和领土完整的一切形式的外来干涉。根除种族歧视种族隔离
    关于种族主义的决议说：会议考虑到种族歧视和种族隔离的做法是罪恶和不人道的；
    深信种族主义严重否定了人权和人类尊严的基本原则，因而正在成为一个非常危险的因素，在非洲的某些地方越来越广泛地散布着有害的影响，以致于很可能会把这个大陆卷入暴力和血泊之中；
    厌恶地注意到南非政府首脑最近在重新当选时发表的关于他将推行更加残忍的歧视和迫害南非有色人种的政策的谈话；因此
    一、谴责全世界各地，特别是南非联邦、中非联邦、怯尼亚和非洲其他地区的种族歧视和种族隔离行径的一切方面；
    二、呼吁全世界的宗教团体和宗教领袖支持一切争取根除种族主义和种族隔离的努力；
    三、要求联合国全体会员国和全世界各国人民支持联合国和万隆会议所通过的谴责这种不人道的行径的决议；
    四、要求联合国全体会员国加紧努力反对和根除这种堕落的非正义行为；
    五、建议所有与会国政府采取有力的措施根除它们自己国内可能出现的种族歧视的痕迹。
    让未独立地方获得独立
    关于非洲未独立地方前途的决议宣布，非洲未独立地方的问题和前途不单是殖民国家的事情，而且也是所有联合国会员国、特别是非洲独立国家的责任。
    决议要求根据未独立地方人民的意志和联合国宪章的规定，为每一个未独立地方规定一个取得独立的明确的日期。决议提出下列要求和建议：
    一、管理国家在这方面尊重联合国宪章，并且迅速采取步骤，根据人民的意志实现宪章的规定和人民的政治愿望，即自决和独立；
    二、管理国家不要在这些未独立地方实行镇压和专断的统治，尊重联合国宪章和世界人权宣言所规定的一切人权；
    三、管理国家在这些未独立地方立即停止一切形式的歧视；
    四、所有与会国家政府尽一切可能援助未独立地方人民争取自决和独立的斗争；
    五、由非洲独立国家会议提供训练和教育未独立地方人民的便利条件；
    六、决定把每年4月15日定为非洲自由日而予以纪念。
    决议谴责任何形式的殖民主义是对非洲国家安全和独立以及对世界和平的威胁。
    多哥选举必须公平民主
    会议在它通过的关于法国管理的多哥的决议中，对这个地方目前的选举法和制度表示严重不安，并且坚决要求管理当局与联合国专员进行充分合作，来保证这个地方的公平、民主的选举。
  法国应同喀麦隆谈判
    会议在它通过的关于法国管理的喀麦隆的决议中，谴责在法国管理的喀麦隆托管地对手无寸铁的人民使用军队，认为这违反了联合国的精神；要求管理国家遵守联合国宪章，并且同人民的代表进行直接谈判，以满足人民的正当愿望；呼吁联合国加紧努力，帮助喀麦隆人民实现他们的正当的政治愿望。
