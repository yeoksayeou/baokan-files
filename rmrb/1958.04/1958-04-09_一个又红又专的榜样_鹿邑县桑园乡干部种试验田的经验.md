The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China forwards to the Party committees of all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions the Henan Provincial Committee's approval and transmittal of "The Experience of Cadres in Sangyuan Township, Luyi County, Cultivating Experimental Fields":

The Henan Provincial Committee's report approving and transmitting "The Experience of Cadres in Sangyuan Township, Luyi County, Cultivating Experimental Fields" (A Model of Being Both Red and Expert) is excellent and is forwarded to all regions for reference.

We believe that other regions must also have good leadership experiences similar to those of the cadres in Hongan County, Hubei Province, who cultivate experimental fields and lead production from within production. The example of the cadres in Sangyuan Township, Luyi County, Henan Province, who have persisted in cultivating "high-yield fields" for four years, is one such case. We hope that while promoting the experience of Hongan in cultivating experimental fields, you will also pay attention to summarizing similar local experiences in order to more quickly guide rural cadres in doing a good job of cultivating experimental fields and improve and enhance our leadership methods for rural work. The Central Committee

The Communist Party of China Henan Provincial Committee's Instructions:

The experience of cadres in Sangyuan Township, Luyi County, in cultivating experimental fields is a very valuable material, and it is hereby forwarded to all regions. Please read it carefully.

The cadres of Sangyuan Township have persisted in cultivating "high-yield fields" for four years and have achieved great success. This is a remarkable thing. The spirit of all cadres in the township, especially Comrade Fu Jingyu, Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee, who overcame various difficulties, actively studied technology, and took the lead in cultivating high-yield fields, transforming from a layman to an expert, and promoting the continuous leap forward in production throughout the township, is worthy of everyone's learning.

Many of the cadres in this township originally did not understand production. After cultivating high-yield fields, most of them have become production experts. The relationship between cadres and the masses, which was not close enough, is now as close as family. The masses have changed from disliking cadres to vying for cadres. The average grain yield per mu in the township was originally 164 jin, but now it has reached 404 jin. This method is actually the method of cultivating experimental fields stipulated by the Central Committee. Through cultivating experimental fields, it achieves the goals of training cadres, connecting with the masses, promoting production, being both red and expert, and unifying politics and technology. The problem is that we have not seriously summarized these experiences in the past and raised them to the level of improving leadership methods for universal promotion. The Provincial Committee requires Party committees at all levels to conscientiously implement the Central Committee's notice on universally promoting experimental fields, universally learn from the experience of Hongan County, and study the experience of Sangyuan Township together to universally promote the method of cultivating experimental fields throughout the province.

The cadres of Sangyuan Township have a history of cultivating high-yield fields for four years. They started creating in 1954, gradually promoted it in 1955 and 1956, and universally blossomed in 1957. In the middle, they went through many twists and turns and finally reaped a bountiful harvest. The following is a rough development process of establishing experimental fields in this township.

          Hit a Snag, Received Education

In 1953, as the focus shifted from land reform to production, all cadres in Sangyuan Township actively responded to the Party's call and led the masses in carrying out the production movement. However, because some cadres had not undergone practical production training and lacked production knowledge, and some had participated in labor but did not have high skills, they could talk about production but not produce, and they could talk about technology but did not understand technology. The masses said that cadres leading production were laymen, and the cadres themselves also felt distressed. Some masses criticized the cadres, saying, "You sleep until the sun is high in the sky, don't go to the fields to produce, don't even know the twenty-four solar terms, don't even know how much seed to sow per mu, how can you lead production?" Some deliberately made things difficult for the cadres by asking them to determine the "seed eye" (the place where seeds are sown with a seed drill). When Fu Jingyu, Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee, held a meeting in Doulou Village to talk to the masses about production, someone stood up on the spot and said, "Do you know how many teeth a sparrow has? And you're talking about production!" At first, the township cadres did not understand the criticisms of the masses, thinking that "cadres are not as popular as they were during land reform." When they went to the district for a meeting, they reported the experience of hitting a snag to Peng Jinsheng, the District Party Committee Secretary. Comrade Peng Jinsheng summarized the lessons learned from hitting a snag: "If you don't understand technology, you can't grasp the demands of the masses." He called on everyone to be determined to learn from the old peasants and study production technology. Everything has two sides, good and bad. The masses' sarcasm and criticism promoted the cadres' enthusiasm for studying production.

      Fu Jingyu's Creation, Firing the First Shot

Comrade Fu Jingyu, Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee, was educated by Secretary Peng and felt that the masses' criticisms were reasonable. In the autumn of 1954, he was determined to "operate" on himself first and personally took the lead in cultivating experimental fields (then called high-yield fields). Fu Jingyu was a native of this township and decided to cultivate two mu of experimental fields on his own family's land. At first, he discussed it with others, but people ignored him. But he was not discouraged. He went to the field with his old father to plant densely planted wheat using a set-row drill. When they arrived at the field, the old man heard that dense planting with a set-row drill was being used, and the seeding amount was increased from twelve jin to twenty-two jin. He was so angry that he jumped up and down, pointed at Fu Jingyu, scolded him, and threw down the drill and went home. At this time, Fu Jingyu could not sow seeds alone, so he had to carry the wheat seeds and the drill back home. An enthusiasm for cultivating experimental fields supported Fu Jingyu. He was determined not to give up if he did not succeed. He invited his brother-in-law that day and finally planted the two mu of densely planted wheat. After the wheat was planted, he was afraid that the wheat would not grow well, so he demolished a part of his house wall, accumulated seven carts of house soil fertilizer, and applied two topdressings. As a result, he achieved a high yield when the wheat was harvested, with an average yield of 287 jin per mu, more than double the local average wheat yield of 140 jin per mu. Fu Jingyu's experimental field fired the first shot. The masses in the village generally reflected that "this method is really effective, and we will try it next year." Fu Jingyu's old father, Fu Songlin, also said with shame, "The old methods really can't cure new diseases, and the old technology is really useless." In 1955, Fu Jingyu planted three mu of experimental fields, which were "Nine-Head" wheat, with 24 jin of seeds sown per mu. The amount of fertilizer applied was more than in 1954. Because the wheat harvest in 1954 educated Fu Jingyu's father, he cooperated very well with Fu Jingyu this year. He helped prepare the land during land preparation and happily helped operate the drill during sowing. Due to the combination of new and old technologies, the wheat harvest was even greater this year, with an average of 370 jin per mu, more than twice the local average wheat yield. In 1956, Fu Jingyu's experimental field added several varieties. In addition to wheat, corn, and sweet potatoes, he also experimented with planting millet on 1.2 mu of wheat stubble. Transplanting millet seedlings was to catch the season for planting Chinese cabbage and create three crops a year. Transplanting millet seedlings was a new task, and many commune members did not agree. Fu Jingyu persuaded everyone on the one hand and led several activists to the field to transplant seedlings on the other. When they were transplanting, some passers-by ridiculed them, saying, "You're still transplanting! I harvested what I transplanted yesterday." The few people who worked with Fu Jingyu also wavered. Under Fu Jingyu's leadership, they persisted. When the millet was about to ripen, many commune members still did not believe that it could produce a high yield. Some said, "Go and see the thousand-jin grain and ten-thousand-jin vegetables in Beidi," and some said, "One hundred and fifty jin packaged to others must include the straw." Fu Jingyu was also very worried. He often went to the field to check and compared it with other millet. He found that although the millet in the experimental field grew low, the number of plants was large and the ears were very solid. Although the millet in other fields grew tall, the number of plants was small and the ears were very loose. Only then did he feel relieved. When harvesting, before one cart was finished loading, the average yield was 577 jin per mu, more than twice as high as the 280 jin per mu of spring millet in the commune. Many commune members said, "Our commune is really blessed." Some old peasants said, "You can't catch up with the new technology even on horseback." After four years of personally cultivating experimental fields, Fu Jingyu gained the support of the masses throughout the township and was as close as family to the masses. Whenever a new technology was to be promoted, the peasants would first discuss it with him. As long as the Deputy Secretary nodded, the masses would do it immediately.

            From Point to Surface, Universal Blooming

Fu Jingyu's successful cultivation of two mu of experimental fields in 1954 pointed out the direction for all cadres in the township. Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to cultivate experimental fields, learn production technology, and transform from laymen to experts. The Township Party Committee conscientiously summarized Fu Jingyu's creation and decided to promote it throughout the township. In 1955, 11 mu of experimental fields were planted in the township. In 1956, the experimental fields developed to 58 mu. In 1957, every commune planted experimental fields, developing to 714 mu. Of the thirteen township cadres in the township, except for two secretaries, eleven often participated in labor. Of the seventy main commune cadres, fifty-four often participated in production. Last year, the experimental fields achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with 11 mu yielding more than 1,500 jin per mu, 136.5 mu yielding more than 1,000 jin per mu, 30 mu yielding more than 800 jin per mu, 180 mu yielding more than 600 jin per mu, and 356.5 mu yielding more than 500 jin per mu. The average wheat yield per mu in the 48 mu of wheat in the Fuzhuang Team was 480 jin, of which more than 4 mu were irrigated with rainwater and received two topdressings, reaching 623 jin per mu. Four mu of corn yielded 1,102 jin per mu. The 3.5 mu of three-crop-a-year crops (millet planted after wheat stubble, Chinese cabbage planted after millet stubble) experimented by the Fenglou Team yielded 570 jin of grain and 24,000 jin of Chinese cabbage per mu. The mixed cropping of ploughed bean pods experimented by the Sangyuan Commune yielded 380 jin per mu, and the 3 mu of rice yielded 640 jin per mu. The average yields of the experimental fields were more than twice as high as the general yields. The Township Party Committee used the experience of the experimental fields to guide the township's production movement according to the production season. In 1956, six visits were organized to promote the implementation of dense planting and the replacement of improved varieties for more than 70% of the wheat in the township. In 1957, 24 large-scale visits and comparisons were organized, which greatly promoted the production movement. Last autumn, when resisting drought and sowing wheat, the masses initially lacked enthusiasm. The Township Party Committee successively organized six visits to experimental fields to resist drought and sow wheat, which quickly formed a high tide in the drought resistance movement throughout the township and completed the wheat sowing task ahead of schedule. Yan Xiujing, a 74-year-old commune member of the Yancaolou Commune, originally did not believe that new technology could increase production. He was convinced after visiting the experimental field. He reported his impressions of the visit to the commune members, saying, "New technology is much stronger than old methods."

            Three Forms of Experimental Fields

The forms of experimental fields can be roughly divided into three types: The first type is that the team carries out experimental fields and the cadres provide guidance. This method is suitable for cadres whose jobs are not fixed. The disadvantage is that they cannot obtain systematic production knowledge. The second type is that the land plots are fixed and the cadres contract for labor, output, and technology. This method is suitable for commune cadres and cadres stationed in the commune all year round. They can participate in the production process from beginning to end and easily learn production technology, but it is not easy to closely integrate with the masses and learn from each other. The third type is that cadres and the masses jointly carry out experimental fields. This method has many advantages: it can complement each other's strengths, combine new and old technologies, integrate with the masses, establish deep feelings, and promptly understand the situation and problems in production to lead production with production. In terms of experimental content, the main thing is to divide a piece of experimental field and compare it with general land on the same land: watering and not watering, comparing watering once with watering several times; dense planting and sparse planting, comparing early sowing with late sowing, comparing single cropping with mixed cropping; applying base fertilizer and topdressing, comparing one fertilizer with several fertilizers; comparing deep plowing and moisture conservation with shallow plowing; comparing improved varieties with inferior varieties. In this way, it is easy for the masses to make clear comparisons and it is very persuasive.

          The Role and Benefits of Experimental Fields

Promoted a great leap forward in agricultural production. In addition to conscientiously implementing basic measures such as building water conservancy projects and accumulating a large amount of fertilizer on the basis of collectivization, experimental fields played a great role in the township's continuous increase in production year after year. The average grain yield per mu in the township was 164 jin in 1953, 184 jin in 1954, 239.5 jin in 1955, 286.5 jin in 1956, and 404.75 jin in 1957, an increase of nearly one and a half times compared to 1953. In 1957, there were two communes with a yield of 500 jin per mu, three teams with a yield of 600 jin per mu, and eight teams with a yield of 500 jin per mu. There were 1,269 mu of land with a yield of more than 800 jin per mu and 206 mu of land with a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu. With the annual increase in production, all five grain-deficient communes have become surplus grain communes, and 82% of the commune members in the township have increased their income. In 1955, more than 270,000 jin of surplus grain were sold to the state, in 1956, more than 590,000 jin of surplus grain were sold, and in 1957, more than 1.5 million jin of surplus grain were sold. At the same time, public accumulation was expanded. The township's 23 agricultural cooperatives had a total public accumulation of 62,764 yuan. The grain consumption standards of commune members have been increased year after year, averaging 360 jin per person in 1955, 420 jin per person in 1956 (including overproduction grain), and 500 jin per person in 1957 (including overproduction sweet potatoes). The enthusiasm of the masses for production is high, and they are in a happy mood. Such ballads are circulating everywhere: "Sangyuan Township has changed its appearance. The masses have food, clothing, and songs; thousand-jin grain and ten-thousand-jin vegetables, harvest wheat to plant millet, harvest millet to plant Chinese cabbage; in the past, we were hungry when there was a drought, but now we don't have to worry when there is a drought. The more drought, the drier the land, the cadres lead the front line, the well platform is the base camp, the bottom of the well platform is the front line, the waterwheel is like a machine gun, and splashing water is like a bomb. Dry land is like Chiang Kai-shek, and when he sees a bomb, he is completely wiped out."

Changed the work style of cadres and strengthened the relationship with the masses. Of the thirteen full-time cadres in the township, except for two secretaries, eleven are stationed in agricultural cooperatives all year round to personally cultivate experimental fields and eat, live, and work with the masses. Fu Jingyu, Deputy Secretary of the Township Party Committee, and Hua Yuchun, the Township Head, have become experts in farming. They can do everything from shaking the drill, sowing seeds, winnowing, and plowing and harrowing the land. Five people are equivalent to the medium-level technical level of peasants, and four people have learned general technology. Of the seventy main commune cadres, except for sixteen main accountants, all have mastered production technology and can personally take the lead in leading commune members' production. The Party Branch Secretary of Luzhuang Commune originally would not grow crops at all. Now he has learned five major farm jobs such as plowing and harrowing the land. Li Wangui, the Deputy Township Head, is a young activist who has not participated in labor and does not know anything about farm work. After two years of practical labor, he has learned production. Last year, the corn planted on wheat stubble in the experimental field yielded 434 jin per mu. In the process of labor, the cadres established deep feelings with the masses. The masses changed from being annoyed by the cadres in the past to competing for cadres. When the cadres stationed in Wangtongzhuang, Fenglouzhai, Luzhuang and other communes were transferred, the commune members and commune cadres repeatedly asked the Township Party Committee not to transfer them.

Broke with conventions and changed the old habits of the masses. In the past, the masses did not apply topdressing at all, but now they can apply it two to three times. In the past, they did not believe in improved varieties from other places, but now they have universally adopted improved varieties. In the past, the masses did not listen to the promotion of new technologies, but now they follow suit as soon as it is advocated. The masses generally praised the experimental field as a guide to increased production, a key to happiness, and a classroom for educating people. There is nothing wrong with following the methods of the experimental field.

Changed the face of backward villages and backward communes. The township originally had seven third-class communes, which could not complete various tasks in the past, did not accept advanced technology, and had very poor production. Now they have all become first- and second-class communes. Songgou Commune's yield per mu was only a few dozen jin in the past. In 1956, it cultivated seven mu of experimental fields, and the yield per mu increased to 724 jin. The enthusiasm of the commune members for production has greatly increased. Luzhuang Village only harvested 50 jin of wheat per mu in the past, but last year it harvested 116 jin per mu. In the past, autumn grain only harvested 85 jin per mu, but last year it harvested 200 jin per mu. This village owed thousands of jin of public grain every year in the past, but since 1956, it has been able to complete it ahead of schedule.

            Institutionalize Experimental Fields

The leadership method of cadres cultivating experimental fields in Sangyuan Township has pointed out the road of being both red and expert for rural cadres. The cadres throughout the township are leading the great leap forward in agricultural production with full confidence and are determined to become experts in agricultural production. To this end, the Township Party Committee decided to institutionalize experimental fields, persist in them for a long time, and has made comprehensive arrangements for cultivating experimental fields this year. It is required that on the existing basis, each township cadre should cultivate two to three mu of experimental fields, each commune cadre should cultivate three to four mu, and each team should cultivate about five mu. All experimental fields should achieve a yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu, of which 15 mu of key experimental fields should achieve a yield of double 1,000 jin per mu. Now the work team and township cadres have bought manure baskets and are picking up manure in their work gaps. Comrade Fu Jingyu has accumulated 3,000 jin of fertilizer and is applying the fourth topdressing to the experimental field (wheat). The broad masses have fully invested in water conservancy and the accumulation of fertilizer and topdressing movements to strive to achieve a yield of 560 jin per mu in 1958 and a township with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu in 1962.

    一个又红又专的榜样
    ——鹿邑县桑园乡干部种试验田的经验
    中共中央转发河南省委批转“鹿邑县桑园乡干部种试验田的经验”各省、市、自治区党委：
    河南省委批转“鹿邑县桑园乡干部种试验田的经验的报告”（一个又红又专的榜样）很好，转发各地参考。
    我们相信像湖北省红安县的干部那样种试验田，从生产中领导生产这样一种良好的领导经验，其他地区一定也有。河南省鹿邑县桑园乡的干部四年来坚持种“丰产田”的榜样就是一例。希望你们在推广红安种试验田经验的同时，注意总结当地类似的经验，以便更快地指导农村工作干部搞好种试验田的工作，改进和提高我们对农村工作的领导方法。	中　央
    中共河南省委会的批语：
    鹿邑县桑园乡干部种试验田的经验，是一篇很有价值的材料，特转发各地，请你们细致阅读。
    桑园乡的干部四年来坚持种“丰产田”，取得很大的成就，这是一件了不起的事情。全乡干部中特别是乡党委副书记傅景玉同志，排除各种困难，积极钻研技术，带头种丰产田，由外行变内行，推动全乡生产连续跃进的精神，值得大家学习。
    这个乡的干部，原来有许多人不懂生产，经过种丰产田，多数已经变成了生产能手；原来干部和群众的关系不够密切的，现在和群众亲如一家，群众由厌干部变成了争干部；原来全乡粮食平均亩产一百六十四斤，现在亩产达到四百零四斤。这种方法，实际也就是中央所规定的种试验田的方法，经过种试验田，达到锻炼干部，联系群众，推动生产，又红又专，政治与技术的统一的目的。问题在于我们过去没有认真总结这些经验，提高到改进领导方法上加以普遍推广。省委要求各级党委，认真贯彻执行中央关于普遍推行试验田的通知，普遍学习红安县的经验并将桑园乡的经验一并研究，把种试验田的方法，在全省普遍推广。
    桑园乡干部种丰产田已有四年之久的历史，1954年开始创造，1955和1956年逐步推广，1957年普遍开花。中间经过许多曲折的过程，终于获得了丰收的果实。下面就是这个乡建立试验田的一个大概发展的过程。
          碰了钉子，受到了教育
    1953年由土改转向生产，桑园乡全体干部积极响应了党的号召，领导群众开展生产运动。但是，由于有的干部本身没有经过实际生产锻炼，缺乏生产知识，有的虽参加过劳动，但技术不高，讲生产不会生产，讲技术不懂技术，群众说干部领导生产是外行，干部本身也感到苦恼。有的群众批评干部说：“你们睡到日头多高才起床，不上地生产，连二十四个季节都不懂，一亩下多少种都不知道，怎领导生产呢？”有的故意为难干部叫给定“籽眼”（耧出种籽的地方）。乡党委副书记傅景玉在杜楼村开会向群众讲生产时，当场就有人站起来说：“你们知道麻喳子几个牙？还讲生产哩！”乡干部开始对群众的批评，思想上不大通，认为“干部不如土改时吃香了。”到区里开会时，向区委汇报了碰钉子的经过，区委书记彭金生同志向大家总结了碰钉子的教训：“不懂技术，就抓不住群众要求。”号召大家下决心向老农学习，钻生产技术。任何事情都有好坏两个方面，群众的讽刺和批评，促进了干部钻研生产的积极性。
      傅景玉的创造，打响了第一炮
    乡党委副书记傅景玉同志受了彭书记的教育，认为群众批评的有道理，1954年秋天便下决心先从自己头上“开刀”，亲自带头种试验田（当时叫丰产地）。傅景玉是本乡人，确定在自己家里地上种二亩试验田。开始他和别人商量，人不理他。但他并不灰心，和自己的老父亲下地种密植麦。到了地里，老头一听说是采用套耧密植，下种量由十二斤增加到二十二斤，气的双脚乱跳，指着傅景玉骂了一顿，扔下耧回了家。这时傅景玉一人没法下种，只好把麦种和耧背回家去。种试验田的一股热情支持着傅景玉，搞不成功决不罢休，当天把自己的姐夫请来，才把二亩密植小麦种上。麦子种上后，他唯恐麦子长不好，于是就把自己的屋山墙扒了一个，积了七车屋土肥，施了两次追肥。结果麦收时获了丰产，每亩平均产量二百八十七斤，比当地一般小麦亩产一百四十斤高一倍以上。傅景玉的试验田打响了第一炮。村上群众普遍反映说：“这个办法真中，明年咱也试试。”傅景玉的老父亲傅松林也惭愧地说：“真是老法子不能治新病，老技术真不中了。”1955年傅景玉种了三亩试验田，是“九头”小麦，每亩下种二十四斤，肥料比1954年上的多。因为1954年的小麦丰收，教育了傅景玉的父亲，这一年他和傅景玉合作的很好，整地时帮助整地，下种时高兴地帮助架耧。由于新老技术的结合，这一年小麦获得了更大的丰收，每亩平均三百七十斤，比当地一般小麦产量高两倍多。1956年傅景玉的试验田品种增加了好几样，除小麦、玉米、红芋外，还试验了一亩二分麦茬栽谷子。移苗栽谷是为了赶季节种白菜，创造一年三作。移栽谷子是一件新工作，许多社员不赞成，傅景玉一面说服大家，一面带领几个积极分子下地移苗。他们在移苗栽种的时候，有些走路的人还讽刺说：“你们还栽哩！俺那里昨天栽的今天就收了。”和傅景玉做活的几个人也动摇了。在傅景玉的领导下才坚持下来。谷子长到快熟的时候，许多社员还不相信能丰产，有的说“快到北地看看咱千斤粮万斤菜”，有的说“一百五十斤包给人家还得连秆草在内”。傅景玉心里也很耽心，经常下地查看，和其他谷子比较，他发现：试验田的谷子虽然长得低，但株数多，穗很结实；其他地里的谷子长得虽高，但株数少，穗很松。他这才放下心来。收割的时候，一车没拉完，结果每亩平均收到五百七十七斤，比社里的春谷每亩二百八十斤高一倍多。许多社员说：“咱社里真有福气”。有些老农说：“骑马也赶不上新技术。”傅景玉经过四年亲自种试验田，得到了全乡群众的拥护，和群众亲如一家。凡是推广一件新的技术，农民都要先和他商量，只要副书记点头，群众马上就干。
            由点到面，普遍开花
    傅景玉1954年种的二亩试验田获得成功，给全乡干部指出了方向，大家一致表示决心要种试验田，学会生产技术，由外行变内行。乡党委认真地总结了傅景玉的创造，决定在全乡推广。1955年全乡种了十一亩试验田，1956年试验田发展到五十八亩，1957年社社种试验田，发展到七百一十四亩。全乡十三个乡干部，除两个秘书外，有十一人经常参加劳动；七十个主要社干，有五十四人经常参加生产。去年试验田获得了空前未有的丰收，亩产一千五百斤以上的十一亩，亩产千斤以上的一百三十六点五亩，亩产八百斤以上的三十亩，亩产六百斤以上的一百八十亩，亩产五百斤以上的三百五十六点五亩。傅庄队四十八亩小麦平均亩产四百八十斤，其中有四亩多浇雨水，施了两次追肥，亩产达到六百二十三斤；四亩玉米亩产一千一百零二斤。冯楼队试验的三亩半一年三熟作物（麦茬种谷，谷茬种白菜），亩产粮五百七十斤，白菜二万四千斤。桑园社试验的混作犁垡豆子亩产三百八十斤，三亩水稻亩产六百四十斤。试验田的平均产量都比一般产量高两倍以上。乡党委根据生产季节，利用试验田的经验来指导全乡生产运动。1956年组织了六次参观，推动全乡70％以上的小麦实行了密植，改换了良种。1957年组织了二十四次大型的参观评比，大大推动了生产运动。去年秋天抗旱种麦时，开始群众劲头不大，乡党委连续组织了六次参观试验田的抗旱种麦，使全乡抗旱运动迅速形成高潮，提前完成了种麦任务。阎草娄社七十四岁的老社员阎修敬，原来不相信新技术能增产，参观了试验田服气了，他向社员报告参观感想说：“新技术比老办法强得多。”
            试验田的三种形式
    试验田的形式大体可分三种：第一种是队里搞试验田，干部进行指导。这种办法适合工作岗位不固定的干部，缺点是不能取得系统的生产知识。第二种是固定地块，干部包工、包产、包技术。这种办法适合社干和常年驻社的干部，能够自始至终参加生产过程，容易学会生产技术，但不易和群众密切结合，互相学习。第三种是干部和群众合伙搞试验田。这种办法好处多：能和群众取长补短，新老技术结合；能和群众打成一片，建立深厚的感情；能够及时了解生产中的情况和问题，以生产领导生产。在试验内容上，主要是在同等土地上，划出一块试验田和一般地作对比：浇水和不浇水，浇一水与浇几水对比；密植与稀植，早播与晚播，单作与混作对比；施底肥与追肥，一肥与几肥对比；深耕保墒与浅耕对比；良种和劣种对比。这样，便于群众作显明的比较，说服力大。
          试验田的作用和好处
    促进了农业生产大跃进。该乡连年获得增产的原因，除了在合作化的基础上认真贯彻了兴修水利、大量积肥等项基本措施之外，试验田起了很大的作用。全乡1953年粮食平均亩产一百六十四斤，1954年平均亩产一百八十四斤，1955年平均亩产二百三十九点五斤，1956年平均亩产二百八十六点五斤，1957年平均亩产四百零四点七十五斤，比1953年增产将近一倍半。1957年全乡出现了两个亩产五百斤社，三个亩产六百斤队，八个亩产五百斤队；有一千二百六十九亩地亩产八百斤以上，有二百零六亩地亩产千斤以上。随着生产逐年增加，五个缺粮社全部变成余粮社，全乡82％的社员增加了收入。1955年卖给国家余粮二十七万多斤，1956年卖余粮五十九万多斤，1957年卖余粮一百五十万斤。同时扩大了公共积累，全乡二十三个农业社，共有公共积累六万二千七百六十四元。社员吃粮标准年年提高，1955年每人平均三百六十斤，1956年每人平均四百二十斤（包括超产粮），1957年每人平均五百斤（包括超产红薯）。群众生产情绪高涨，心情畅快，到处流传着这样的歌谣：“桑园乡变了样，群众有吃、有穿、有歌唱；千斤粮、万斤菜，割了麦子种谷子，割了谷子种白菜；过去天旱饿肚子，现在天旱不用急。天越旱，地越干，干部领导上前线，井台上边安大营，井台下边是战线，水车好比机关枪，泼水好比是炸弹，干地好比是蒋介石，一见炸弹消灭完。”
    改变了干部作风，密切了群众关系。全乡十三个脱产干部，除两个秘书外，十一个人常年驻在农业社亲自种试验田，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动。乡党委副书记傅景玉和乡长花俞春二人已经成了种地行家，摇耧、撒种、扬场、犁耙地都会干，有五人相当于农民中等技术水平，有四人学会了一般技术。七十个主要社干，除十六个主要会计外，都掌握了生产技术，都能亲自带头领导社员生产。鹿庄社党支书过去根本不会种庄稼，现在学会了犁耙整地等五种主要农活。副乡长李万贵是个青年积极分子，没参加过劳动，农活一项不通，经过二年实践劳动，学会了生产，去年试验田种的麦茬玉米，每亩产四百三十四斤。干部在劳动过程中，和群众建立了深厚的感情，群众由过去烦干部变成了争干部。阎草娄社老中农阎修敬过去听说干部讲生产起来就走，现在要求干部到他队里领导生产。王统庄、冯楼寨、鹿庄等社驻社干部调走时，社员和社干三番五次地要求乡党委不要调走。
    打破了常规，改变了群众的旧习惯。过去群众根本不上追肥，现在都能上二次到三次；过去对外地良种不相信，现在普遍采用了良种；过去推广新技术，群众不听，现在一提倡就跟着干。群众普遍称赞试验田是增产的引路人，是开心的钥匙，是教育人的课堂，照试验田的办法搞没错。
    改变了落后村、落后社的面貌。全乡原有七个三类社，过去各项任务都完不成，不接受先进技术，生产搞的很差，现在都变成一、二类社了。宋沟社过去亩产量只有几十斤，1956年搞了七亩试验田，亩产量提高到七百二十四斤，社员生产劲头大大提高。鹿湾庄过去小麦每亩只收五十斤，去年每亩收到一百一十六斤；秋粮过去每亩只收八十五斤，去年每亩收到二百斤；这个庄过去每年都欠几千斤公粮，从1956年以来都能提前完成。
            把试验田形成制度
    桑园乡干部种试验田的领导方法，给农村干部指出了又红又专的道路。全乡干部正在信心百倍地领导农业生产大跃进，决心要使自己成为农业生产中的能手。为此，乡党委决定，要把试验田形成制度，长期坚持下去，并对今年种试验田已经作了全面安排。要求在已有基础上，每个乡干部种二至三亩试验田，社干部每人种三至四亩，每个队种五亩左右。所有试验田都要达到亩产一千斤以上，其中十五亩重点试验田达到亩产双千斤。现在工作组和乡干部每人都买了粪筐，在工作空隙中拾粪。傅景玉同志已经积了三千斤肥料，正在上试验田（小麦）的第四次追肥。广大群众全力投入了水利和积肥、施追肥运动，为1958年达到亩产五百六十斤，1962年达到亩产千斤乡而奋斗。
