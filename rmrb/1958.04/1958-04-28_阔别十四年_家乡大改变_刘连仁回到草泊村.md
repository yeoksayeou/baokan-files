Xinhua News Agency, Gaomi, April 26th (Reporters Kang Ning and Ai Yun report): Compatriot Liu Lianren returned today to his hometown, Caobo Village, Jinggou Township, Gaomi County, which he had been thinking of day and night for fourteen years, and reunited with his elders, relatives, and friends.

The night before returning to the hometown where he grew up, Liu Lianren was very excited and did not sleep well all night in Gaomi City. He woke up especially early this morning. After much anticipation, at eight o'clock, he boarded a long-distance bus with his wife, son, and aunt. This was the last leg of his journey before reaching his hometown. Along the way, he excitedly gazed at the scenery outside the bus window. After the bus sped for more than ten miles, Liu Lianren pointed to the green sea of wheat fields and said, "It's really different! When I used to farm at home, the land was in small plots, but now they are all connected into large areas." "Look, there are at least ten or more people working in the fields together; no one is working on their own." A large village appeared to the left front of the road. Liu Lianren hurriedly pointed it out to everyone: "Isn't that Zhangjiadun! I was held there overnight the day before I was captured."

Liu Lianren got off the bus at Chaigou Station. The head of the agricultural cooperative in his village and the cooperative members had already arrived with two horse-drawn carts to wait for him.

From a distance, a row of white walls emerged, hidden among the red flowers and green trees. This was Caobo Village, where Liu Lianren grew up. His hometown had become so beautiful that it was almost difficult for Liu Lianren to recognize. Liu Lianren got off the cart and walked quickly towards the sound of gongs and drums coming from the village. He met a crowd of people pouring out of the village not far from the village. Liu Lianren couldn't recognize everyone's face. He grabbed several outstretched hands and greeted everyone repeatedly with excitement.

Crossing a small bridge was Liu Lianren's home. The cooperative members had arranged his home for him many days in advance. The houses had all been freshly painted, and the two newly painted black gates had red paper couplets pasted on them, reading "Rather suffer in deep caves than be an enemy's slave." Inside the gate was a small courtyard with several apricot, plum, and toon trees, all of which had sprouted new leaves. A portrait of Chairman Mao hung in the main room. The couplets on the door read, "Separated from wife and children for fourteen years, the whole family reunited today," with the horizontal scroll reading "Long Live the Communist Party." All kinds of daily necessities had also been prepared. Liu Lianren went to his room and sat on the kang. He touched the smooth new mat with his hand, looked up at the newly papered ceiling, and, seeing the completely new scene of the whole house, said with mixed emotions: "This house was originally built by me, but it became old later. Before I even got home, it was arranged so well for me. I am so happy!"

The entire Caobo Village was like a festival today, with people wearing new clothes to welcome the return of their fellow villager. Even old grandmothers who could no longer walk were helped out to see Liu Lianren. Liu Lianren's courtyard and house were filled with fellow villagers and elders. Fourteen years of joys and sorrows made people's hearts extremely excited. Liu Lianren and his fellow villagers repeatedly said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we wouldn't have been able to meet in this lifetime!"

    阔别十四年　家乡大改变
    刘连仁回到草泊村
    据新华社高密26日电　新华社记者康宁、艾蕴报道：难胞刘连仁今天回到他十四年来日夜思念的故乡——高密县井沟乡草泊村，同父老亲友们团聚。
    刘连仁在即将回到自己生长的家乡的前夜，心情十分激动，他在高密城里一夜没有睡好。今天早晨他醒来得特别早。好容易盼到八点钟，他同妻子、儿子和姑母等登上了长途汽车。这是他到达家乡以前最后的一段路程，沿途他兴奋地张望着车窗外面的景物，汽车急驰了十多里，刘连仁手指着绿海般的麦田说：“真是大不一样了！当初我在家种地时，土地都是小块块，现在都连成大片了。”“你看，在地里干活的至少也是十来个人在一起，没有自己干的了。”有一个大庄子在公路的左前方出现，刘连仁急忙指给大家看：“那不是张家墩！我被抓的头一天就在这里押了一宿。”
    刘连仁从柴沟车站下了车，他村子的农业社社长同社员们早就赶着两辆马车在等着他。
    从远处望见在一片红花绿树掩映下露出一带白墙，这就是刘连仁的生长之地草泊村。故乡变得这般美丽，几乎使刘连仁难于辨认。刘连仁下了马车，迎着村子里传出来的锣鼓声徒步急行，在离村不远的地方同村里涌出来的人群相遇。刘连仁来不及辨认每个人的面孔，他一手抓住几只伸过来的手，心情激动地连声向大家问候。
    跨过一座小桥，就是刘连仁的家门。社员们在好多天以前就替他把家安排好了。房屋都已粉刷一新，两扇新油漆的乌黑大门，贴着红纸对联，写着“宁愿苦居深洞，不作敌人奴隶”。走进大门是一个小巧的庭院，几棵杏树、李树和香椿，都已吐出新叶。堂屋里挂着毛主席像。房门上的对联写的是“妻离子散十四年，全家团圆在今朝”，横联是“共产党万岁”。各种日用家具也都已准备齐全。刘连仁到自己屋里坐在炕上，他用手摸摸光滑的新席子，抬头看看新糊的顶棚，看到全屋焕然一新的景象，万感交集地说：“这房子原是我亲手盖的，后来旧了；没等我到家就给我安顿得这么好，我真是太高兴！”
    整个草泊村今天就像过节一样，人们穿着新的服装来迎接乡亲的归来。已经走不动的老太太也叫人搀扶着出来看看刘连仁。刘连仁的院子、屋子里挤满了乡亲父老，十四年的悲欢离合使人们的心情异常激动，刘连仁和他的乡亲们都一再地说：“不是共产党毛主席，咱这辈子难见面啊！”
