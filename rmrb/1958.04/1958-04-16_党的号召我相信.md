    I believe in the Party's call, a great leap forward in agricultural production; I believe in the Party's call, a field over a "zhang" yields grain by the "cheng", cotton 100 "jin", grain 1000 "jin".
    Building a reservoir as big as the sky, impounding water in a whole mountain gully, making water climb over mountains, how can production not increase?
  (Hubei "Cuckoo") The Program spread to the commune, rushing to the construction site at midnight, sweat soaking the yellow mud, commune members vigorously building water conservancy.
    The Program spread to the fields, grass seeds covered with quilts, the earth draped in green, laying the foundation for high yields.
    The Program spread to the pens, oxen wearing coats, December as warm as spring, winter plowing as fast as machines.
    The Program spread to the school, attending classes crowded every night, loud reading echoing, capturing the cultural front.
    The Program spread to the heart, commune members united together, contributing an extra ounce of strength, building socialism.
  (Zhejiang "Shaoxing News") Cooperation plus mechanization, a great future for socialism, mountains have paths where people walk, labor machines like fast horses, even thatch and thorns can blossom.
        (Hubei Qichun) Standing on a high mountain looking at the plain, high mountain and plain are not the same, socialist great construction, golden ridges and silver seas, a treasure mountain.
  (Jiangxi "Jinggangshan News") The power of cooperation is greater than mountains, we will make the river move its home, sand dunes become rice bins, a happy life for ten thousand years.
          (Guizhou Jinsha)

    党的号召我相信农业生产大跃进，党的号召我相信，田过丈来粮过秤，皮棉百斤粮千斤。修个水库天来大，关水要关一山洼，要水翻山就翻山，产量怎能不增加？
  （湖北“布谷鸟”）纲要传到社里，三更赶到工地，汗珠滴湿黄泥，社员大修水利。纲要传到田里，草子盖上棉被，大地披起绿衣，丰产打下根基。纲要传到栏里，耕牛穿起大衣，腊月暖如春季，冬耕快如机器。纲要传到校里，夜夜上课拥挤，书声琅琅不息，攻下文化阵地。纲要传到心里，社员团结一起，多出一分力气，建设社会主义。
  （浙江“绍兴报”）合作化加机械化，社会主义奔头大，高山无路人有路，劳动机器如快马，茅草烂刺也开花。
        （湖北蕲春）站在高山望平川，高山平川不一般，社会主义大建设，金垅银海万宝山。
  （江西“井岗山报”）合作力量大过山，要叫河水把家搬，沙丘变成米柜子，幸福生活万万年。
          （贵州金沙）
