Beijing: A Vital Force in Beijing's Industry

    Editor's Note: Beijing's experience in organizing the production forces of schools to participate in local industrial production is very good.
    Organizing school production not only utilizes the productive capacity of school equipment but also has great political significance. It can effectively implement the policy of "diligence and frugality in education," "combining theory with practice," and "integrating education with production," cultivating "red and expert" technical cadres for the country. Beijing's approach has increased the output of local industries, solved many difficulties in scientific research and experimentation, and new product trials for local industries, while also helping schools alleviate some difficulties in diligence and frugality in education, particularly resolving the issue of labor locations for half-work, half-study students.
    Currently, the production equipment and technical capabilities of many universities, secondary vocational schools, and technical schools have not been well utilized. Relevant cities can emulate Beijing's approach and strengthen leadership in this work.
    This newspaper reports: Beijing is utilizing the equipment and manpower of various universities, secondary vocational schools, and technical schools to produce various means of production and consumer goods. The total planned production value for this year is approximately 64 million yuan. The main products include: 6,000 steam-powered tractors (of which 1,000 are produced in collaboration with Baoding City; the remaining 5,000 account for more than half of Beijing's total steam-powered tractors production in the first half of the year); 9,000 water pumps; 2,500 four-foot tool lathes; 10 sets of small hydropower station equipment; 3 sets of wind power station equipment; over 10,000 pieces of agricultural machinery; 150,000 automobile parts; 50,000 bicycles; 1,000 electronic instruments; 2,000 watches; and 160,000 radios, etc.
    Beijing's universities, secondary vocational schools, and technical schools possess a significant amount of equipment, much of which is imported, highly precise, and of excellent quality. Moreover, there are many professors providing guidance in theory and scientific research, enabling the production of many valuable industrial products, and even the manufacturing of precision products that the city cannot produce. Preliminary estimates suggest that the value of industrial products that can be produced annually reaches approximately 100 million yuan. Using this equipment, important products such as agricultural machinery, metal-cutting machine tools, and power generation equipment can be produced. By utilizing the schools' chronometers and other precision testing instruments, high-quality watches, clocks, and many other types of instruments can be produced. Some professors at universities are conducting trials for new products in conjunction with scientific research. A professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology has successfully developed "resorcinol" for making blueprints; Tsinghua University is researching high-energy storage batteries to enable cars to run without gasoline; and the Aviation Institute will trial-produce an An-2 aircraft for transportation, agriculture, forestry, and geological survey purposes. These capabilities indeed represent a vital new force, and effectively organizing participation in local industrial production will significantly contribute to the development of local industry.
    Organizing school production has gained the support of a broad range of students, workers in the practical training factories, and some professors. Their enthusiasm is very high. Workers patiently teach students how to operate machinery, some staying past quitting time and not resting on Sundays. Students quickly learn basic techniques such as sand casting and metal cutting, and their production results are also very good. The rejection rate for the castings produced by the Mining Institute for over 2,000 steam-powered tractors is only 3%. Especially in terms of ideology, the education workers give the students is significant. Students report: "The workers are very patient in teaching apprentices, even better than the professors." Students experience the excellent qualities of the workers in practical labor. In the past, some professors and lecturers believed that engaging in production at school would affect teaching, but they have now changed their views. Many professors regularly go to factories and work alongside students and workers.

### 各级工业学校——北京工业的生力军

    各级工业学校——北京工业的生力军
    编者按　北京市组织学校的生产力量参加地方工业生产的经验是很好的。
    组织学校生产，不但可以利用学校生产设备能力，而且有很大的政治意义。它可以很好地贯彻“勤工俭学”、“理论与实际相结合”、“教育与生产相结合”的方针，为国家培养“又红又专”的技术干部。北京市的这种做法，既增加了地方工业的产量，解决了地方工业在科学研究试验、新产品试制上的许多困难，又帮助学校解决了勤工俭学的某些困难，特别是解决了半工半读学生的劳动场所。
    现在，许多高等学校、中等专业学校和技工学校的生产设备和技术力量，都还没有很好地加以使用。有关城市可以仿效北京市的做法，加强对于这一工作的领导。
    本报讯　北京市正在利用各高等学校、中等专业学校和技工学校的设备和人力，生产各种生产资料和生活资料。今年安排的生产总产值约六千四百万元，主要的产品有：锅驼机六千台（其中一千台是和保定市协作生产的；剩下的五千台，占北京市上半年锅驼机总数的一半以上）；水泵九千台；四尺工具车床二千五百台；小型水电站设备十套；风力发电站设备三套；农业机械一万多件；汽车零件十五万件；自行车五万辆；电子仪表一千件；手表两千个；收音机十六万部等等。
    在北京市的各高等学校、中等专业学校和技工学校，占有较多的设备，其中不少是进口的、精密度很高的、质量很好的设备，又有许多教授在理论上和科学研究上进行指导，能够生产许多很有价值的工业产品，甚至还可制造本市不能生产的精密产品。据初步估计，每年可以生产的工业品的价值，达一亿元左右。利用这些设备，能够生产农业机械、金属切削机床、发电设备等重要产品。利用学校的定时计和其他精密的检验仪器，还能生产质量很好的手表、钟表和其它许多种仪表。高等学校的某些教授，正在结合科学研究进行一些新产品的试制工作。北京工学院一位教授已经试制成功一种制蓝图用的“间苯三酚”；清华大学正在研究使汽车不用汽油的高能蓄电池；航空学院将试制一种为运输、农业、林业和地质勘察等多种用途的安—二式飞机。这些能力，确是一支生力军，很好地组织参加地方工业生产，会对地方工业的发展起很大的作用。
    组织学校生产，得到广大学生、实习工厂中工人和部分教授的拥护。他们的劲头很高。工人耐心地教学生操作，有的到点不下班，星期天也不休息。学生很快学会了翻砂、金属切削等初步技术，生产成绩也很好。矿业学院生产的二千多件锅驼机的铸件，废品率只占3％。尤其在思想上，工人给学生的教育很大。学生反映：“工人教徒弟很耐心，比教授教的好”。学生在实际劳动中体会了工人的优良品质。过去部分教授和讲师认为在学校搞生产会影响教学，现在也改变了看法，不少教授经常下工厂，和学生、工人们一起劳动。
