Broadcast calisthenics bloom among street residents

　　(Our report) News. The fact that street residents in their sixties and seventies participate in broadcast calisthenics every day was simply unimaginable in the past, but during the great leap forward in sports, it has become a reality.

　　Every day at 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., one can see forty to fifty people doing broadcast calisthenics on Tingshu Street in the West District of Chengdu. Those participating in the exercises are all residents of this street, including housewives and elderly people who cannot participate in labor. Their average age is over forty-five. For example, old lady Chen Quanfu is already seventy-six years old this year, and old man Jiang Jiqin is already sixty-six years old, and they all do exercises every day like young people.

　　The residents of Tingshu Street started doing exercises on April 15th of this year, not for long, and they are only able to do the first and second sections of the third set of broadcast calisthenics. They had not been active in the past, and at first they were uneven when they did them, but they persisted in doing them every day, and did them seriously each time. At present, for the residents of Tingshu Street, broadcast calisthenics has become a compulsory course every day.

　　When broadcast calisthenics was first launched among the residents of Tingshu Street, some people were unwilling to participate. The elderly thought: gesturing is not very meaningful; young women thought: there are people coming and going on the street, and it is embarrassing to watch. However, after others took the lead and demonstrated, they quickly got used to it. Now the residents of Tingshu Street generally respond well to broadcast calisthenics. They all say that after attending meetings for a long time, or after working hard at home, they feel very comfortable in their bodies when they come out to move their waists and legs. Doing broadcast calisthenics is indeed beneficial.

　　Organizing sports activities among residents in Chengdu, the broadcast calisthenics in Tingshu Street is a good start. The Chengdu Sports Commission is preparing to follow the practice of Tingshu Street and organize more residents to participate in broadcast calisthenics activities. (Attached photo)

### 广播操在街道居民中开花

    广播操在街道居民中开花
    本报讯　六、七十岁的街道居民天天参加做广播操，这在过去简直是不可想像的事，可是在体育大跃进中，已成为事实了。
    每天上午十时和下午四时，在成都市西城区厅署街上就可以看到有四、五十人在做广播操。参加做操的都是这条街上的居民，其中有家庭妇女，有不能参加劳动的老人。他们的平均年龄在四十五岁以上。像陈全福老太太今年已经七十六岁了，蒋季勤老大爷已经六十六岁了，他们都像青年人一样每天做操。
    厅署街的居民做操是今年4月15日开始的，时间并不长，第三套广播操，现在才只会做第一、二节。他们过去没有活动过，乍一练会，做起来参差不齐，但他们每天都坚持做，每次都认真地做。目前，对厅署街的居民来说，广播操已成为每天必修的课程。
    广播操刚一在厅署街居民中开展时，有些人不愿参加。年老的认为：比比划划，意思不大；青年妇女认为：大街上人来人往，看着不好意思。但是，经过别人带头、示范，很快地他们也就习惯了。现在厅署街的居民对广播操普遍反应很好。他们都说，开会开久了，在家里做活做累了，出来活动活动腰腿，感到身体很舒畅。做广播操确实有好处。
    在成都的居民中有组织地开展体育活动，厅署街的广播操算是一个好的开始。成都市体委准备按照厅署街的做法，把更广泛的居民组织起来，让他们参加广播操活动。（附图片）
