    Wei Shiqing Creates New Deep Plough
    Initial Ploughing and Re-Ploughing Can Be Done Simultaneously

    (Reported by this newspaper) Liujiang County, Guangxi, recently created a deep ploughing tool. It involves installing a small, sickle-shaped plough with a triangular bottom end behind a “Five-Three” walking plough. This allows for initial ploughing and re-ploughing to be done in one go, equivalent to using a tandem plough, and ploughs more than one inch deeper than a regular walking plough. According to experiments conducted at the county farm and Sixian Cooperative, using this tool for deep ploughing allows for both deep ploughing and soil loosening. Because the two plough heads are of different sizes and positioned one in front of the other, the oxen pulling the plough do not experience excessive strain. The Sixian Cooperative conducted an experiment: two identical oxen, one pulling a “Five-Three” walking plough and the other pulling a “Five-Three” walking plough with this deep ploughing attachment, achieved the same ploughing speed.

    This tool was designed by Wei Shiqing, the stationmaster of the Liujiang County Agricultural Tool Station.

    The deep ploughing attachment is not expensive. Each one uses about 2.5 jin of iron and costs around one yuan. One person can make two to three per day.

    Liujiang County is now preparing to vigorously promote this tool.

### 韦仕庆创造深耕新犁  初犁复犁能同时进行

    韦仕庆创造深耕新犁
    初犁复犁能同时进行
    本报讯　广西柳江县最近创造了一种深耕工具，即是在五三步犁犁后，再安装一状如镰刀形、下端设有三角形状的小犁。这样，一次即可进行初犁及复犁，等于进行套犁，比一般步犁深耕一寸以上。根据在县农场和思贤社等地试验，采用这种工具进行深耕，既可深耕，又能松土。由于两个犁头一大一小、一前一后，牛拉犁也不吃力。思贤社曾进行试验：两条同样的牛，一拉五三步犁，一拉这种装置有深耕器的五三步犁，翻犁速度完全相等。
    这一工具是由柳江县农具站站长韦仕庆设计的。
    这个深耕器价钱不贵，每个约用铁二斤半，需一元左右。一人一天可打二至三个。
    现在，柳江县正准备大力推广这一工具。
