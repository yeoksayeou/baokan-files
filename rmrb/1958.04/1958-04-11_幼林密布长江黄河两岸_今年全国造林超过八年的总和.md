Xinhua News Agency, 10th: During this year's spring afforestation campaign, neat rows of young forests have been created along both banks of the Yangtze River in Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, and along both banks of the Yellow River in Shandong and Henan, and on the eastern bank of the Yellow River in Shanxi. This was accomplished through the vigorous efforts of the broad masses along the banks, who, working in designated sections, completed the task in a vigorous campaign.

At the same time, Shanxi Province has created a 30-meter-wide protective forest along the 1,700-li banks of the Fen River and is continuing to advance towards the Hutuo River, Xiao River, Qingzhang River, Zhuozhang River, and Qin River. Along the Yalu River, Liao River, Raoyang River, and Daling River in Liaoning Province, millions of trees have been planted through the hard work of the people along the rivers. The afforestation tasks have been completed along both banks of the Wu River in Zunyi, Sinan, and Qianxi counties of Guizhou Province. The people of various counties in the Zhanjiang Special Zone of Guangdong Province have launched a vigorous bamboo planting campaign along the major and minor rivers, and have decided to plant two million mu of bamboo.

This newspaper reports: As of now, the national spring afforestation has been completed on 221.74 million mu, exceeding the total afforestation area in the eight years since liberation by 14%. 8.3 billion trees have been planted around houses and villages, and a total of 233 counties have completed their afforestation tasks.

The speed of afforestation is fast, the momentum is great, and the quality is relatively good. In Guizhou Province, the afforestation area advanced rapidly from March 25th to April 4th at an average rate of 1.5 million mu per day. The province averaged 2.5 mu of afforestation per person. Since late February, more than 600,000 people in the 16 counties of the Qian Southeast Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture have been engaged in shock afforestation, and by the end of March, the afforestation plans of the 16 counties were basically realized. Most of the afforestation in this prefecture has undergone comprehensive land preparation and is carried out with careful planting and fine cultivation, with Chinese fir timber forests accounting for about 50%.

This spring's afforestation work is closely integrated with water conservancy. All localities have generally proposed that wherever water conservancy is built, afforestation should follow. Anhui, Gansu and other provinces have included afforestation as a part of water conservancy projects. In Yuxian County, Henan Province, more than 600,000 mu of afforestation has been completed, 80% of which has been dug with contour trenches and fish-scale pits.

Local afforestation also pays attention to large-scale concentration. According to statistics from Guizhou, Anhui, and Hunan provinces, 330 10,000-mu forest cooperatives and more than 20,000 1,000-mu forest cooperatives have emerged this spring. Two 100,000-mu forests have appeared in Handan and Shijiazhuang prefectures in Hebei Province.

In order to strive for 300 million mu of afforestation this year, all localities are preparing to carry out afforestation in the third and fourth seasons and have strengthened the work of seedling cultivation. The Bijie Special Zone of Guizhou Province has cultivated more than 32,000 mu of seedlings, averaging more than 5 mu of seedlings per mu, which has laid a good foundation for greening.

    幼林密布长江黄河两岸
    今年全国造林超过八年的总和
    新华社10日讯　在今年春季造林运动中，沿四川、湖北、江西、安徽、江苏各省的长江两岸，以及沿山东、河南的黄河两岸和山西黄河东岸已经营造起了排列整齐的幼林。这是沿岸广大群众鼓足干劲，分片分段，在轰轰烈烈的运动中突击完成的。
    与此同时，山西省在汾河一千七百里长的河岸上，营造了三十公尺宽的护岸林，并继续向滹沱河、潇河、清漳河、浊漳河、沁河进军。辽宁省境内的鸭绿江、辽河、绕阳河和大小凌河两岸，经过沿河人民的苦战，已经种植了千万棵树木。贵州省遵义、思南、黔西县境内的乌江两岸已经完成造林任务。广东省湛江专区各县人民已经风起云涌的掀起在大小江河两岸的种竹运动，并决定种竹二百万亩。
    本报讯　全国的春季造林截至目前已完成二亿二千一百七十四万亩，超过解放后八年间造林面积总和的14％，四旁植树八十三亿株，已经完成的植树任务的县共二百三十三个。
    造林的速度快，声势大，而且质量较好。贵州省的造林面积从3月25日到4月4日十天之内平均每天以一百五十万亩的进度猛向前进，全省平均每人已造林二亩半。黔东南苗族侗族自治州十六个县从2月下旬以来，每日有六十余万人突击造林，到3月底，十六个县造林计划基本实现。这个州造林大部分经过全面整地，实行细栽细造，其中杉木用材林占50％左右。
    今春造林工作和水利密切结合着，各地普遍提出水利修到哪里，造林跟到哪里。安徽、甘肃等省都已将造林列为水利工程的一项内容；河南禹县全县造林六十多万亩，80％都挖了水平沟、鱼鳞坑。
    各地造林还注意了大片集中，根据贵州、安徽、湖南三省统计，今春出现了万亩林社三百三十个，千亩林社二万多个。河北省邯郸和石家庄两专区出现十万亩林两个。
    为了争取今年造林三亿亩，各地正准备进行三季、四季造林，并加强了种苗培育工作。贵州省毕节专区已育苗三万二千多亩，平均育苗五亩以上，这就为绿化打好了基础。
