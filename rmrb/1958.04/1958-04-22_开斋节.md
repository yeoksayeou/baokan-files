    Eid al-Fitr
    "Eid al-Fitr" is a major festival for people who believe in Islam, also known as "Eid al-Adha" or "Roza Festival." According to Islamic religious regulations, fasting is observed for the month preceding Eid al-Fitr. All those who believe in Islam do not eat or drink during the day for this month, and only resume normal life on the day of "Eid al-Fitr." On this day, Muslims celebrate the successful completion of the "month of fasting" with special joy.
    On this day, mosques across the country hold "Eid al-Fitr" prayers. People's governments and commercial institutions in various regions fully supply various items needed for the festival, according to the special needs of various ethnic groups who believe in Islam, and organize sources of goods for them in advance.
    Islamic holidays are international, but the specific dates of the holidays vary slightly from place to place, based on the full moon. This year, China's "Eid al-Fitr" is on April 21.

    开斋节
    “开斋节”是信仰伊斯兰教人民的一个重大的节日，又称“尔德节”，“肉孜节”。按照伊斯兰教典规定，在开斋节的前一个月进行封斋，凡信仰伊斯兰教的人在这一个月里，白天不吃不喝，直到“开斋节”这一天才恢复正常生活。“开斋节”这一天，伊斯兰教徒都以特别欢乐的心情来庆贺“封斋月”的圆满结束。
    这一天，全国各地的清真寺都举行“开斋节”会礼，各地区的人民政府商业机构按照信仰伊斯兰教各民族的特殊需要，充分供应节日所需的各种用品。并事先为他们组织货源。
    伊斯兰教的各节日是国际性的，但节日的具体日期因以月圆为标准各地稍有不同。今年我国的“开斋节”是4月21日。
