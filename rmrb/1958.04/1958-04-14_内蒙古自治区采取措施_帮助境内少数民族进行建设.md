Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is taking measures to actively assist ethnic minorities within its borders in developing construction projects. The Autonomous Region People's Committee recently discussed and approved the allocation of significant funds annually, starting this year, to help ethnic minority areas within its borders carry out various construction projects. The planning committees and ethnic affairs departments of Hulunbuir League, Jirem League, and Ju-Ud League also held joint meetings to determine, based on the distribution and economic characteristics of ethnic minorities within their borders, to primarily develop agriculture, animal husbandry, and hunting, and correspondingly develop industry, handicrafts, transportation, culture, education, and health in ethnic minority areas. Currently, in eastern Inner Mongolia, preparations have begun in areas with larger concentrations of ethnic minorities to build farm implement repair shops, tractor teams, livestock breeding stations, veterinary stations, and Hui nationality oil presses. Plans are also underway to build vegetable farms for the Oroqen hunters and to help Daur and Korean farmers expand water conservancy projects. Appropriate arrangements have also been made in western Inner Mongolia for construction projects for the Hui, Manchu, and other scattered ethnic minorities.
	Transportation, cultural, educational, and health undertakings in ethnic minority areas are continuing to be developed. Funds have been allocated by the government to purchase motorized sailboats and other equipment for navigation from the Oroqen Autonomous Banner to the Morin Dawa Banner. This year, five ethnic minority primary schools will be established in remote mountainous and desert areas, and Hohhot Hui Nationality Middle School and other schools will add senior high school classes. At the same time, six hospitals and health clinics will be established in remote mountainous areas.
	In addition to the 1.1 million Mongolians and 7.94 million Han people, Inner Mongolia is also home to over a dozen ethnic minorities, including Oroqen, Daur, Evenk, Korean, Hui, and Manchu, totaling over 120,000 people engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, hunting, handicrafts, and fishing.

    内蒙古自治区采取措施
    帮助境内少数民族进行建设
    新华社呼和浩特讯　内蒙古自治区采取措施积极帮助境内少数民族发展建设事业。自治区人民委员会最近讨论通过从今年起每年拨巨量款项帮助境内少数民族地区进行各项建设。呼伦贝尔盟、哲里木盟、昭乌达盟计划委员会和民族工作部门也举行了联席会议，根据境内少数民族分布情况、经济生活特点，确定：以发展农、牧、猎业为主，相应地发展少数民族地区的工业、手工业、交通运输业和文教、卫生等事业。现在，内蒙古东部已开始在少数民族聚居较多的地方筹建农具修配厂、拖拉机队、牲畜配种站、兽医工作站和回民榨油厂等，并且为鄂伦春族猎民筹建蔬菜场，帮助达呼尔、朝鲜族农民扩建水利工程。内蒙古西部地区对聚居的回族、满族和散居的其它少数民族的建设项目，也作了适当安排。
    少数民族地区的交通、文教卫生事业正继续进行建设。从鄂伦春自治旗到莫力达瓦旗通航用的机动帆船等用具，已由政府拨款购买。在偏僻的山区和沙漠地带，今年要建立五所少数民族小学，呼和浩特回民中学等校要增设高中班。同时，在边沿山区建立医院和卫生所六处。
    内蒙古境内除了一百一十万蒙古族和七百九十四万汉族人民外，还居住着鄂伦春、达呼尔、鄂温克、朝鲜、回、满等十多个少数民族，共十二万多人，从事农、牧、林、猎、手工业和渔业等生产。
