    The mass movement demanding a halt to nuclear weapons testing and an end to the nuclear arms race is unfolding in Britain like a surging tide. Not long after the four-day "Ban the Bomb" march ended, London held another mass demonstration on the 13th, with over 10,000 people participating, against the continued testing of nuclear weapons.

    "To avoid being wiped out by the hydrogen bomb, we must eliminate the hydrogen bomb!" This is a slogan shouted by the British people. The British people are keenly aware that, due to Britain's geographical circumstances, an atomic war would mean destruction for them. Therefore, the Conservative government's policy of pursuing the nuclear arms race has long provoked strong discontent among the British people. Moreover, the Soviet Union's pioneering initiative to unilaterally halt nuclear weapons testing has greatly advanced the British people's struggle against nuclear weapons.

    The British government stubbornly refuses to respond to the Soviet Union's call for a cessation of nuclear weapons testing. It attempts to convince the British people that stopping nuclear weapons testing is of no benefit to peace until a comprehensive disarmament agreement is reached. But can this absurd excuse fool anyone? British Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell correctly pointed out at the mass rally in London on the 13th: "If (nuclear weapons testing) is stopped, further progress in developing new weapons can be prevented, at least the nuclear arms race can be stopped"; and in this way, the door to comprehensive disarmament can be opened.

    The fact is obvious that if Britain, as one of the three countries in the world currently possessing nuclear weapons, follows the Soviet example and immediately halts nuclear weapons testing, it can powerfully promote an end to the nuclear arms race. This is in the interest of world peace and entirely in the interest of Britain itself. The Conservative government, defying the will of the British people and insisting on continuing nuclear weapons testing, will inevitably be spurned by the people. The Conservative Party's consecutive crushing defeats in the recent British parliamentary by-elections reflect the direction of British popular sentiment.

    The British people understand that the Conservative government is closely colluding with the U.S. government in implementing the nuclear arms race policy. Currently, American military aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs are constantly roaring over Britain; and soon, American missile bases will be built on British soil, which not only damages British sovereignty but also seriously threatens British security. Therefore, while the British people are launching a wave of protests against the Conservative government's suicidal policy, they are also angrily condemning the United States' sinister plan to use Britain as a nuclear war base. The slogan "Yankee Go Home!" is getting louder and louder in Britain.

    The British people's mass movement against nuclear weapons is continuing to expand. Around the world, the struggle to demand a halt to nuclear weapons testing is also flourishing. The vast peace-loving people unite and strengthen the struggle, and the goal of stopping nuclear weapons testing can certainly be achieved.

    英国人民坚强的意志
    本报评论员
    要求停止核武器试验和结束核军备竞赛的群众运动，正像汹涌的浪潮一样在英国展开着。历时四天的“不要氢弹”大游行结束不久，13日伦敦又举行了有一万多人参加的反对继续试验核武器的群众示威大会。
    “要不被氢弹消灭，就要消灭氢弹！”这是英国人民所喊出的一个口号。英国人民深深意识到，由于英国的地理环境关系，一场原子战争对他们来说就是毁灭。因此，长期以来，保守党政府所执行的核军备竞赛政策一直引起英国人民的强烈不满。而最近苏联率先单方面停止核武器试验的伟大创举，更使英国人民反对核武器的斗争有了巨大的发展。
    英国政府顽固地拒绝响应苏联关于核武器试验的呼吁。它企图使英国人民相信，在全面裁军协议没有达成之前，停止核武器试验对和平是没有任何好处的。可是，难道这种荒谬的借口能骗过任何人吗？英国工党领袖盖次克尔在13日伦敦的群众大会上就正确地指出：“如果（核武器试验）停止了，就可以制止在发展新武器方面的进一步进展，至少可以制止核军备竞赛”；而这样，也就能促使全面裁军的大门敞开了。
    事实很明显，英国作为目前世界上拥有核武器的三个国家之一，如果效法苏联的榜样而立即停止核武器试验，就可以有力地推动结束核军备竞赛。这既符合世界和平的利益，也完全符合英国本身的利益。保守党政府违背英国人民的意志而坚持继续核武器试验，它就必将受到人民的唾弃。最近英国几次议会补缺选举，保守党连续遭到惨败，就反映了英国人心的向背。
    英国人民懂得，保守党政府在执行核军备竞赛政策的时候，是和美国政府紧密地勾结在一起的。目前，在英国上空，带着氢弹的美国军用飞机正不断呼啸而过；而不久，在英国的土地上又将建立起美国的导弹基地，这不但损害了英国的主权，而且严重地威胁了英国的安全。因此，英国人民在对保守党政府的自杀性政策掀起抗议浪潮的同时，也对美国把英国作为核战争基地的罪恶计划提出了愤怒的谴责。“美国佬回家去！”这个口号在英国是一天比一天更响亮了。
    英国人民反对核武器的群众运动还在继续扩大。在全世界，要求停止核武器试验的斗争也在蓬勃发展。爱好和平的广大人民团结一致，加强斗争，停止核武器试验的目的，是一定可以实现的。
