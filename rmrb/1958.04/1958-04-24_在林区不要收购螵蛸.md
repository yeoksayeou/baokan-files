    Do Not Purchase Praying Mantis Egg Cases in Forest Areas
    The praying mantis is a very beneficial insect that can prey on various agricultural and forestry pests. In Xuguang Agricultural Cooperative, Lidong Township, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, an old man named Zhang picks up some mantis eggs (oothecae) every spring and ties them to trees with string. The trees on which they are hung do not suffer from insect pests. The entire cooperative is now promoting this method, and the effect is remarkable. Recently, supply and marketing departments, in order to collect oothecae for medicinal purposes, have been purchasing large quantities of praying mantis eggs in mountainous and forested areas. In Caomiao and Gejia Townships of Wendeng County alone, more than 400 catties of praying mantis eggs have been sold, which is detrimental to the protection of mountain forests. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments not purchase large quantities of oothecae in forest and orchard areas in order to protect the natural enemies of pests and protect agricultural and forestry production.

### 在林区不要收购螵蛸

    在林区不要收购螵蛸
    螳螂是个很大的益虫，它能捕食各种农林害虫。山东荣成县俚岛乡旭光农业社有个姓张的老大爷，每年春天拾一些螳螂卵（螵蛸）用线系挂在树上，挂的树就无虫害发生，现在全社推广这个办法，效果显著。最近供销部门为了采集螵蛸入药，已在山林地区大量收购螳螂卵，仅文登县草庙、葛家两乡就出卖螳螂卵四百余斤，这对保护山林是不利的。因此我建议有关部门在林区、果区不要大量收购螵蛸，以保护害虫天敌，保护农林生产。
