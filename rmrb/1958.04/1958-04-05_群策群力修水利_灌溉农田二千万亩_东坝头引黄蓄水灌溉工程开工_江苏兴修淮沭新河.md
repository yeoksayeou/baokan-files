Pooling Efforts to Build Water Conservancy Projects, Irrigating 20 Million Mu of Farmland
Dongbatou Yellow River Diversion and Storage Irrigation Project Begins
Jiangsu Constructs the Huai-Shu New Canal

(Report from our newspaper) Henan Daily reports: Following the full-scale construction of large-scale projects such as the Yellow River Diversion and Irrigation Ji-Wei Expansion Project, the Suyang Lake Storage and Irrigation Project, and the Bo Mountain Irrigation Canal in Henan Province, the Dongbatou Yellow River Diversion and Storage Irrigation Project, located in Henan and jointly constructed by Henan and Shandong provinces, has also begun construction. This project will divert 520 flow units of the Yellow River at medium and high water levels from Dongbatou on the south bank of the Yellow River in Lankao County, Henan Province, irrigating a total of 19.8 million mu of land. Upon completion of the project, the large area of land with sandy soil and alkali, prone to drought and flooding for years due to past Yellow River breaches and course changes, will undergo fundamental changes.

The Dongbatou Yellow River Diversion and Storage Irrigation Project is primarily focused on storage, combining storage and irrigation. It will utilize the North Channel of the Yellow River and the old course of Xianfeng, adopting a method of gradual storage, storing more than 1.7 billion cubic meters of Yellow River water within Henan and Shandong provinces. It will also utilize low-lying areas within and near the irrigation area, storing more than 2.4 billion cubic meters of Yellow River water through a network of storage methods. These water quantities, combined with surface runoff storage, irrigation, and groundwater sources, are estimated to irrigate 10.08 million mu of farmland in the Kaifeng and Shangqiu regions of Henan Province, and 9 million mu of farmland in the Heze region of Shandong Province.

Due to the large-scale diversion and storage of Yellow River water, this project will effectively reduce high-water flood peaks of the Yellow River. At the same time, the stored water can be used to increase the water volume of the Huiji River, Tonghui Canal, Bao River, Xiang River, and Qiulonggou, opening up navigation on these five rivers, facilitating transportation in eastern Henan; six small-scale power stations can be built, generating 1,200 kW of electricity.

The Dongbatou Yellow River Diversion and Storage Irrigation Project is large in scale, requires little investment, involves arduous tasks, and has a tight schedule. It is a Great Leap Forward project that adopts simultaneous surveying, designing, and construction. In terms of engineering quantity: the excavation of earthwork for the main canal and branch canals is more than 23 million cubic meters; there are 44 bridges, sluices, and other structures; and there are many branch and minor canals in each region and county. Completing this project requires hundreds of thousands of people. The main canal (including the headgate) and branch canals require a planned 150,000 people, fighting hard for 70 days, to ensure water release by "June 1st." These projects are mainly completed by relying on the collective wisdom and efforts of the masses, with the state only planning to invest more than 19 million yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 2nd: The Huai-Shu New Canal water conservancy project, which will fundamentally change the water conservancy situation in northern Jiangsu, commenced on the 1st. This project is a comprehensive one involving flood control, drainage, irrigation, navigation, and power generation, and is also the largest water conservancy project in the history of Jiangsu Province.

The Huai-Shu New Canal starts from the Erhe Sluice on the edge of Hongze Lake, passes through Qingjiang City and Shuyang, and reaches the coast of the Yellow Sea at Xinhailian City, with a total length of 200 kilometers and a river width of 1.4 kilometers. The entire project includes more than 80 major structures such as culverts, dams, and bridges, and three hydroelectric power stations will be built along the river.

After the completion of the Huai-Shu New Canal, the flood control standard for the lower reaches of the Huai River will be raised from the current once-in-50-years to once-in-300-years, completely eliminating the situation of "Lianshui Machang Ditch, nine out of ten years of crop failure, crabs crawling in the pot, loaches digging under the threshold," and ensuring the safety of the Lixiahe granary. After the northward diversion of the Huai River, the irrigated area can be increased by 11.44 million mu. Starting this year, the Xuhuai Plain, which has always been considered to have low yields, can see tens of millions of mu of new rice paddies. At the same time, this project can also enhance drainage capacity.

The Huai-Shu New Canal project will open up an important shipping route for the Xuhuai area. After the Huai-Shu New Canal is completed, it will also provide a large amount of water—freshwater—for the development of industry in Xu, Huai, and Xinhailian Cities. Hydroelectric power stations will also be established in Yangzhuang, Zhuma, Touhe Sluice and other places to meet the electricity needs for rural drainage and irrigation, and will form a power grid with Qingjiang City and Xinhailian City to supply electricity for the new and expanded factories in the two cities during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

The three major water conservancy projects, namely the Erhe Sluice, the Yanhai Zhuma Hub Project, and the Suqian Dam Project, which started construction last autumn, are the first phase of the Huai River Diversion into Yi River and Huai River Northward Diversion Project, and are also the main hub projects of this huge project.

### 群策群力修水利　灌溉农田二千万亩  东坝头引黄蓄水灌溉工程开工  江苏兴修淮沭新河

    群策群力修水利　灌溉农田二千万亩
    东坝头引黄蓄水灌溉工程开工
    江苏兴修淮沭新河
    本报讯　河南日报报道：河南省继引黄灌溉济卫扩建工程、宿鸭湖蓄灌工程、薄山灌溉渠等大型工程全面施工之后，位于河南、由河南山东两省共同兴修的东坝头引黄蓄水灌溉工程也开始施工。这个工程从河南省兰考县黄河南岸东坝头引用黄河中高水位五百二十个流量，共可灌溉一千九百八十万亩土地。工程完成后，由于过去黄河决口改道而造成的地多砂碱、连年旱涝的大片地区将从根本上改变面貌。
    东坝头引黄蓄灌工程是以蓄为主，蓄灌结合的工程。它将利用黄河北道及咸丰故道，采用节节拦蓄办法，在河南、山东两省境内蓄黄河水十七亿多公方；它还将利用灌溉区域以内及灌溉区附近低洼地区用星罗棋布方式的蓄水方法，蓄黄河水二十四亿余公方。这些水量结合地面径流蓄灌与地下水源，估计在河南省开封、商丘两专区可灌溉农田一千零八十万亩，在山东菏泽专区可灌溉农田九百万亩。
    由于大量引蓄黄河水，这个工程将有力地削减黄河高水位洪峰。同时，还可利用蓄水，增加惠济河、通惠渠、包河、响河，与虬龙沟等河道水量，开辟这五条河道航运，便利豫东交通；筹建小型发电站六处，发电一千二百瓩。
    东坝头引黄蓄灌工程，规模宏大，花钱很少，任务艰巨，时间紧迫，是采取边勘测、边设计、边施工的一项大跃进工程。就其工程数量：总干渠和干渠开挖土方有二千三百多万公方；桥、闸等建筑物四十四座；各专、县还有很多的支渠毛渠等工程。完成这一工程，需要几十万人。总干渠（包括渠首闸）和干渠计划十五万人，苦战七十天，保证“六一”放水。这些工程主要是依靠群策群力完成，国家只计划投资一千九百多万元。
    据新华社南京2日电　根本改变苏北水利面貌的淮沭新河的水利工程已经在1日开工。这项工程，是防洪、治涝、灌溉、航运和发电等综合性的工程，也是江苏省历史上最大的水利工程。
    淮沭新河从洪泽湖边的二河闸起，经清江市、沭阳到黄海边的新海连市，全程长二百公里，河宽一点四公里。全部工程中有涵洞、闸坝、桥梁等主要建筑物八十多处，沿河还要兴建三座水力发电站。
    淮沭新河完工后，淮河下游的防洪标准将由现在的五十年一遇，提高到三百年一遇，可以彻底消灭“涟水马厂沟，十年九不收，锅腔里爬螃蟹，门槛底下挖泥鳅”的状况，并保证里下河谷仓的安全。淮水北调以后，可以增加灌溉面积一千一百四十四万亩。从今年起，一向被认为产量较低的徐淮平原上，就可以出现千万亩的新稻田。同时，这项工程还可以增强排涝能力。
    在淮沭新河的工程中，要为徐淮地区开辟了一条重要的航线。淮沭新河建成后，还为徐、淮、新海连市发展工业提供了大量的用水——淡水。在杨庄、朱码、头河闸等地还将设立水力发电站，满足农村排涝和灌溉用电，并将同清江市，新海连市结成一个电力网，供应两个市的第二个五年计划期间新建和扩建工厂的用电。
    去年秋季先后开工兴修的二河闸，盐河朱码枢纽工程和宿迁闸坝工程等三大水利工程，是分淮入沂、淮水北调工程的第一期工程，也是这项巨大工程的主要枢纽工程。东坝头引黄蓄灌工程布置示意图
