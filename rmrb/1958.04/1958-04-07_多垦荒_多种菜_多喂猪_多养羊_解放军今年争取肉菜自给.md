Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward, have raised the targets for sideline production, striving to be fully or largely self-sufficient in meat and vegetables for consumption this year.

The Beijing Military Region originally planned to produce enough vegetables and meat to be self-sufficient for six to eight months this year. After the Two Antis campaign began, this was revised to eight to ten months of self-sufficiency. Now, many units have proposed year-round self-sufficiency. A unit of the Guangzhou Military Region originally planned to provide 250 jin of vegetables per person this year, but has now raised this to 500 jin. The Kunming Military Region plans to increase pork production by 100% and vegetable production by 200% to 300% compared to last year. The Fujian Frontline troops will raise more than three times as many pigs this year as last year, and plant six to twelve times more vegetables. Under the slogan "Compete in combat in the past, compete in the Great Leap Forward today," the "Jinan Second Regiment" in its challenge to the "Jinan First Regiment" proposed: the entire regiment will reclaim 600 mu of wasteland for farming, raise 3,200 pigs, 300 sheep, and 200 cattle, achieve self-sufficiency in firewood, and produce 300 jin of pumpkins per person for feed.

Many units, in addition to producing for self-sufficiency, are also preparing to support other units and personnel with some of their meat and vegetables. A division of the Beijing Military Region plans to produce more than 5 million jin of vegetables this year, from which it will allocate 500,000 jin to supply fraternal units. Staff members of a certain hospital guarantee self-sufficiency in pork and will supply it to convalescing patients.

The vast numbers of officers and soldiers in various units have already reclaimed large amounts of wasteland and planted vegetables and fodder crops. In order to catch up with the planting season, officers and soldiers of a regiment of the Guangzhou Military Region reclaimed 140 mu of wasteland overnight. The logistics department of the Shanghai Garrison, which raises an average of 1.8 pigs per person, reclaimed 30 mu of land in barracks and nurseries, planting sweet potatoes, alfalfa, and collard greens. They also planted a large number of water hyacinths and aquatic plants in ponds, solving the problem of green fodder for half a year for the entire pig farm. Troops stationed in Shenyang, Nanjing, Qinghai, Tibet, and other places have also used their spare time to reclaim large tracts of wasteland.

    多垦荒　多种菜　多喂猪　多养羊
    解放军今年争取肉菜自给
    新华社6日讯　中国人民解放军各部队以大跃进的精神提高了副业生产的指标，争取今年食用的肉类和蔬菜全部或大部自给。
    北京部队原来计划今年生产自给蔬菜和肉类六个月到八个月，双反运动开始修改为生产自给八个月到十个月，现在有不少单位提出全年自给。广州部队某部原计划今年每人自给蔬菜二百五十斤，现在提高到了五百斤。昆明部队计划全年生产猪肉比去年增加一倍；生产蔬菜比去年增加两倍到三倍。福建前线部队今年养猪的数字比去年增加三倍以上，种菜的数字比去年增加六倍到十二倍。在“当年赛战斗、今日比跃进”的口号下，“济南第二团”向“济南第一团”的挑战书中提出：全团开荒种地六百亩，养猪三千二百头，养羊三百只，养牛二百头，烧柴自给，每人生产作饲料用的南瓜三百斤。
    许多部队除了生产自给以外，还准备把一部分肉食和蔬菜支援其他单位和人员。北京部队某师计划今年生产蔬菜五百多万斤，从中抽出五十万斤供应兄弟部队。某医院工作人员保证猪肉自给，并供给休养员食用。
    各部队广大官兵已经大量开垦荒地，种植蔬菜和饲料作物。广州部队某团为了赶下种季节，官兵们连夜开荒一百四十亩。平均每人养猪一点八头的上海警备区后勤部机关，在营房和苗圃空处开垦了三十亩地，种植红薯、苜蓿、牛皮菜等，还在水塘中种了大量水浮莲花和水生，解决了整个养猪场半年的青饲料。驻沈阳、南京、青海、西藏等地的部队，也都利用业余时间开垦了大量荒地。
