Xinhua News Agency, Gaomi, 23rd. Liu Lianren and his relatives, accompanied by Cui Lihua, head of the Shandong Provincial Red Cross Society, and others, arrived in Gaomi at a little after 1:00 pm today.

More than 1,000 people from the Gaomi County Red Cross Society, various government organizations, and people from all walks of life welcomed him at the train station. Liu Lianren's aunt, sister, as well as fellow sufferers Chen Zongfu, Chen Guoqi, and Deng Zhuanyou, who were abducted with Liu Lianren and escaped from the Japanese coal mines together, also rushed from dozens of miles away overnight to welcome him.

After Liu Lianren got off the train, he tightly embraced his gray-haired aunt with tears in her eyes, held his sister's hand, and was surrounded by the enthusiastic crowd as he walked out of the station and onto an open-top car.

From the train station to the city, a distance of more than three miles, Liu Lianren was greeted by the masses along the way, young and old. Hundreds of enthusiastic hands reached out to Liu Lianren from all directions; countless smiling faces with tears in their eyes turned towards Liu Lianren. Liu Lianren stood on the car and repeatedly bowed deeply to everyone, and bent down to shake hands with them. He said loudly:
"Fellow villagers, I am back alive! Thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" "I have a bellyful of things to say to my fellow villagers, but I can't say it all at once!"

The car moved slowly through the crowded flow of people. After traveling less than half a mile, Liu Lianren looked around and pointed to the area around the department store and farm tool factory, saying: "What a big change! It was here that more than eighty of us fellow sufferers broke free from our ropes and fled, only to be encircled by the Japanese devils riding their foreign horses, and we couldn't escape. What a taste that was!" Fellow sufferer Chen Zongfu said: "That's right! It was here that my head was stabbed by a bayonet, and I was put on the train wearing half a bloody garment!"

At 4:00 pm, Zhang Hongda, the County Head of Gaomi County, and Deputy County Heads Sun Weiyue and Liu Xiwen received Liu Lianren and his relatives and fellow sufferers.

Liu Lianren and others left Jinan at a little after 6:40 am this morning. Lü Qishan, Secretary-General of the Jinan Municipal People's Committee, Yuan Zihe, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Shandong Provincial People's Committee, and others went to the station to see them off.

    刘连仁回到家乡
    高密县群众热情欢迎
    新华社高密23日电　刘连仁和他的亲属由山东省红十字会负责人崔立华等陪送，今天下午一点多钟到达高密。
    高密县红十字会、各机关团体和各界人民一千多人到火车站欢迎。刘连仁的姑母、妹妹以及同刘连仁一起被掳去又一起从日本煤矿中逃出来的难友陈宗福、陈国起、邓撰友等，也都从数十里外连夜赶来欢迎。
    刘连仁下车后，紧紧拥抱了鬓发已白满面热泪的姑母，拉着妹妹，被热情的人群簇拥着走出车站，上了敞篷汽车。
    从火车站到城里有三里多路，刘连仁受到了沿途群众扶老携幼的夹道欢迎。几百只热情的手从四面八方伸向刘连仁；多少个含着热泪的笑脸朝着刘连仁。刘连仁站在车上不断向大家深深鞠躬，并且弯下腰来跟大家握手。他大声地说：
  “乡亲们，我活着回来了！多亏着共产党毛主席！”“我满肚子话要跟乡亲们说，一下子说不出来！”
    汽车在拥挤的人流中徐徐前进。车行了不到半里路，刘连仁向四周环顾了一下，指着百货公司、农具厂一带说：“变化多大啊！就是这地方，当初我们八十多个难友在这里挣脱绳索逃跑，被日本鬼子骑着大洋马圈住了，没跑得掉。那时候是个啥滋味！”难友陈宗福说：“可不是！我就是在这里被刺刀戳破头，穿着半个血衣装上车去的！”
    下午四时，高密县县长张洪达、副县长孙维岳、刘喜文接见了刘连仁和他的亲属、难友们。
    刘连仁等是今天上午六时四十多分离开济南的。济南市人民委员会秘书长吕岐山、山东省人民委员会办公厅副主任袁子和等都到车站欢送。
