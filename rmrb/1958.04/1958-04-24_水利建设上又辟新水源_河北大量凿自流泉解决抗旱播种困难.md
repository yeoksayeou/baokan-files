Another New Water Source Developed in Water Conservancy Construction
Hebei Drills Numerous Artesian Wells to Solve Difficulties in Drought Resistance and Sowing
    (Reported by this newspaper) Hebei Province is adopting various methods to drill wells in the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains to develop gravity irrigation. This is a new development in Hebei Province's irrigation efforts.
    According to statistics from the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department, as of April 17, the several prefectures relying on the mountains had already dug more than 26,000 wells, extracting 145 cubic meters per second of spring water, with an annual volume of approximately 4.5 billion cubic meters. This can transform nearly 6 million mu of dry land into irrigated land.
    The majority of the wells dug in Hebei Province are artesian wells. The spring water flows from higher elevations through canals to the fields, eliminating the need for water lifting tools for irrigation. According to calculations, digging a water well and installing an animal-powered waterwheel can irrigate two to three mu of land per day, while digging a machine well and installing a small power pump can irrigate 50 mu of land per day. However, the artesian wells already drilled can save at least 200,000 waterwheels or more than 10,000 power pumps. It also saves labor, fuel, draft animals, and fodder for operating machinery. Gravity irrigation has so many benefits that it is very popular with the masses. Baoding Prefecture has already drawn more than 80 cadres and 40,000 laborers to engage in well-drilling and water-finding work year-round.
    Digging artesian wells to utilize groundwater for irrigating farmland has opened up a new water source in water conservancy construction. According to the Hebei Provincial Party Committee's estimate for a drilling plan with 300 flows, the annual increase in water volume will reach more than 9.4 billion cubic meters. This transforms Hebei Province's past situation of using only surface water and underground static storage (which is what machine wells use) for irrigation, implementing a three-pronged approach, accelerating the progress of water conservancy construction, and supporting the current drought resistance and sowing work.

### 水利建设上又辟新水源  河北大量凿自流泉解决抗旱播种困难

    水利建设上又辟新水源
    河北大量凿自流泉解决抗旱播种困难
    本报讯　河北省正在采取多种办法在太行山东麓凿泉，发展自流灌溉。这是河北省灌溉事业的新发展。
    据河北省水利部门统计，到4月17日止，几个靠山的专区已经挖泉二万六千多眼，引出泉水一百四十五秒公方，每年水量约四十五亿多立公方，能使近六百万亩旱地变为水浇地。
    河北省挖出的这些泉，绝大部分是自流泉。泉水从高处经过渠道自流到田里，不需要提水工具汲水灌溉。根据计算，打一眼水井安一辆畜力水车，每天浇地两三亩，打一眼机井安装小型动力抽水机，每天浇地五十亩，但是已经凿出的自流泉，至少能节省二十多万辆水车或一万多台动力抽水机。同时还可节省操纵机械的人工、燃料、耕畜和饲草。自流灌溉有这样多好处，所以很受群众欢迎。保定专区已经抽出了八十多名干部、四万多个劳动力，常年进行凿泉找水工作。
    挖自流泉利用地下水灌溉农田，在水利建设上又开辟了一个新的水源。根据中共河北省委开三百个流量的凿泉计划估算，每年增加的水量共达九十四亿多立公方，这样就转变了河北省过去只用地上水和地下静储量（机井就是用的这种水）灌溉的情况，实行三管齐下，加快了水利建设的进度，支援了当前的抗旱播种工作。
