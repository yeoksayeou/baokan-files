    Singing the Red May
    Various regions in Shanxi Province are actively preparing to launch "Red May" Socialist Singing Movement Month activities.
      The "Socialist Singing Movement Month" will begin on May 1st, combining major festivals such as "May Day" International Labor Day, "May Fourth" Youth Day, and "June First" Children's Day, to mobilize the broad masses to participate in singing. The Shanxi Provincial Cultural Bureau, the Provincial Broadcasting Bureau, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Education Department recently jointly issued a notice, requiring relevant departments in various regions to use all their strength and opportunities to mobilize the masses to sing, so that socialist songs can form a hot and lively singing movement from cities to villages, from factories to mountain villages, and from schools to construction sites, in which "everyone is jubilant and everyone sings and advances vigorously."

    歌唱红五月
    山西省各地正在积极准备开展红五月社会主义歌唱运动月的活动。
      “社会主义歌唱运动月”从五月一日起结合“五一”国际劳动节、“五四”青年节和“六一”儿童节等重大节日活动，发动广大群众参加歌唱。山西省文化局、省广播事业局、共青团省委、教育厅等单位，最近联合发出通知，要求各地有关部门运用一切力量和机会，发动群众歌唱，让社会主义歌声从城市到农村、从工厂到山庄、从学校到工地形成一个“个个欢欣鼓舞、人人高歌猛进”热火朝天的歌唱运动。
