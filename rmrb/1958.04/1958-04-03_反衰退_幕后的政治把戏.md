	Political Tricks Behind the "Anti-Recession"
	Zhang Zhenya
	Week after week passed. The unemployment figures in the United States continued to rise: four million, four and a half million, five million, five and a third million... Urgent telegrams flew to Washington like snowflakes. Newspapers and public opinion were clamoring: "Take action quickly while there is still time." But behind the political curtain in Washington, a political farce aimed at winning votes was being staged.
	Only eight months remain until the Congressional elections. Whoever can win more seats in the Congressional elections this November has a chance to ascend to the throne of the US President in 1960. This is the question that haunts the minds of Washington politicians day and night.
	Dirty political deals have long been taking place within the White House. Nixon reached an "understanding" with Eisenhower: The US President has agreed to transfer all the powers given to him by the Constitution to the Vice President when he "loses his ability to work." The purpose of this trick played by the Republican government is obvious: to enable Eisenhower to "step down" at any time in the next two years and let Nixon act as president, so that the latter can use his administrative position to gain political capital in the 1960 presidential election. Therefore, as soon as this news was leaked, it was particularly fiercely criticized by Congressional Democrats.
	However, the Democrats are not incompetent in playing political tricks. They are gearing up to use the economic recession to deal a fatal blow to the Republican Party, so as to win more seats in both houses of Congress this fall, and then defeat the Republican Party in the 1960 presidential election.
	Therefore, the arrival of this economic recession has become a good topic for politicians of both parties to grab political capital from voters. So in early February, just as the economic situation deteriorated, the drums of the two parties vying for voters became tighter and tighter.
	The first shot was fired by Democratic Senator Gore from Tennessee. On February 5, he accused the Republican government in the Senate of "callousness" and "turning a blind eye to the suffering of millions of unemployed," and accused it of not working hard to "create job opportunities" for the unemployed. Then, Democratic Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts (a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 1960) proposed a bill to increase unemployment benefits. Then, Democratic senators from Minnesota began to criticize the current government's "poor and uninspired policies"...
	Outside of Congress, the Democrats also coordinated to launch an offensive against the Republican government. New Jersey's Democratic Governor Meyner, in early February, lambasted the Eisenhower administration at the National Press Club in Washington for doing nothing to deal with the recession. In New York, Stevenson also clamored that the Republican Party had been concealing and distorting the actual situation. Truman, at the Democratic National Committee meeting, tried his best to nail the label of "depression" on the forehead of the Republican government, saying: "1873, 1893... 1929... Almost every crisis was created during the Republican administration."
	Amid such a chorus of denunciations, the Republicans finally came out to fight back. They accused the Democrats of being cowards, pessimists, and a party that specializes in spreading gloom and taking the United States to war; and said that they should be responsible for this economic recession.
	However, the news that the number of unemployed in January had suddenly increased by 1.12 million came. As a result, public opinion was in an uproar, and the Republican government could not help but feel a little flustered. Eisenhower hurriedly issued a "statement on the current economic situation in the United States," and presented the American public with a long bill to increase government spending to deal with the recession: military orders increased by $5.8 billion, highway construction increased by $600 million, public works increased... But this bill was just a smokescreen. Because the content of the bill was just a repetition of the figures listed in the new budget in January, there was nothing new in it. This, of course, could not be hidden from the eyes of the Democratic politicians. Therefore, on the second day after the statement was issued, eleven Democratic governors, led by New York Governor Harriman, jointly telegraphed Eisenhower, asking him to take a more powerful "practical plan" to save the crisis. At the same time, in order to show voters that they cared more about the people's suffering than the Republicans, the Senate Democrats, under the guidance of their leader Johnson, also put forward various new plans to increase government spending for housing construction, slum clearance, flood control, and land reclamation in a flurry of noise.
	Obviously, the Republican Party was at a disadvantage in this struggle. It is the ruling party, and if it wants to compete with the Democratic Party in spending money, it is obviously "shooting itself in the foot." Therefore, the Republican government had to quickly apply the brakes and change its strategy after Eisenhower issued the first bill. First, Nixon issued a statement saying that "acting too quickly and extensively on anti-recession measures can only lead to the restoration of inflation," and then Eisenhower also changed his tone and said: "The real driving force of the American economy is not the government, but the inherent impetus and vitality of private enterprises."
	But despite this, the sharp rise in the number of unemployed people forced the Eisenhower administration to bite the bullet under pressure from public opinion and continue to issue some reassuring anti-recession bills time and time again to deal with appearances.
	However, this kind of passive approach of following the Democratic Party has made the Republican Party lose even more credibility in front of voters. This is obviously a great threat to the "political future" of Nixon, who will represent the Republican Party in the 1960 presidential election. In order to pander to the public and take the initiative in front of voters, this ambitious vice president finally disregarded the actual financial difficulties of the Republican government and played a trump card that Eisenhower dared not play: tax cuts. On March 10, Nixon told reporters: "Relying entirely on public works is too slow, too insecure, and may be ineffective," and said that he personally "favored tax cuts." After Nixon, Secretary of Labor Mitchell followed suit and spread the news that the government would implement tax cuts.
	The main purpose of the tax cut trump card thrown out by Nixon and Mitchell was to show it to the voters, but this, like the card of "increasing government spending to deal with the economic recession," can only make the Republican government suffer even more. It turned out that various tax cut plans had already been hidden in the pockets of the Democratic Congressmen. As long as Senate and House Democratic leaders Johnson and Rayburn give a slight signal, these plans can be immediately taken out as weapons to attack the Republican Party. Therefore, if the Republican Party wants to fight with the Democratic Party on the issue of tax cuts, it is actually asking for trouble.
	Therefore, after Nixon fired the shot of "tax cuts," it was not the Democrats who were flustered, but the cabinet members of the Republican government.
	First, White House Press Secretary Hagerty quickly came out to flatly deny that the government had any tax cut plans. Senate Republican leader Knowland even categorically stated: "The government will not make a decision on tax cuts until at least two months later." Secretary of the Treasury Anderson, with the authorization of the US President, paid a visit to his fellow Texan, House Democratic leader Rayburn, and Senate Democratic leader Johnson (all three are from Texas), overnight to explain the misunderstanding and apologize, saying that Nixon and Mitchell's words could not be taken seriously, because only he, Secretary of the Treasury Anderson, was the authoritative spokesperson on the issue of tax cuts. Then, after several secret consultations, the two sides quickly announced a so-called "gentleman's agreement": in the future, both parties must consult in advance before proposing tax cut plans. Anderson also guaranteed that there would never be a repeat of the kind of things that Nixon and Mitchell had done.
	The Washington bipartisan battle thus came to a temporary end with a so-called "gentleman's agreement" under the Republican's concession. But the disaster of the millions of unemployed families in the United States, trapped in deep water and fire, has increased unabated. Washington's bipartisan politicians can use the suffering of the people as a tool for their political tricks, but as the economic crisis deepens, a fierce political storm will turn all their fantasies into nothing.

### “反衰退”幕后的政治把戏

    “反衰退”幕后的政治把戏
    张振亚
    一星期一星期过去了。美国的失业数字仍在上升：四百万、四百五十万、五百万、五百三十万……告急电报像雪片似地飞向华盛顿。报刊和舆论都在叫嚷：“乘情况还来得及的时候赶快采取行动”。但是在华盛顿的政治帷幕后面，却正在演出一场以争夺选票为目标的政治把戏。
    距国会选举只剩下八个月了。谁能在今年11月国会选举中夺取更多的席位，谁就有希望在1960年登上美国总统的宝座。这就是今天华盛顿的政客们脑海中日夜萦绕的问题。
    在白宫内部早已在进行着龌龊的政治交易。尼克松同艾森豪威尔达成了一项“谅解”：美国总统已同意在他“失掉工作能力”时把宪法给他的全部权力转交副总统行使。共和党政府玩弄的这个诡计的目的很明显，这是要使艾森豪威尔在今后两年中能随时“让位”给尼克松来代行总统职务，以便后者能利用行政地位博取他在1960年竞选总统时的政治资本。因此，这一消息一泄露，就受到国会民主党人特别猛烈的抨击。
    但是，民主党人在玩弄政治手腕上也不是低能儿。他们正在摩拳擦掌准备利用经济衰退问题给共和党致命一击，好在今年秋天夺取参众两院更多的席位，然后在1960年的总统竞选中打败共和党。
    因此这次经济衰退的来临，倒成了两党的政客们向选民捞取政治资本的好题目。于是2月初，正当经济形势恶化的时候，两党争夺选民的锣鼓就敲得越来越紧密了。
    第一炮是由田纳西州的民主党参议员戈尔放的。2月5日他在参院责备共和党政府的“冷酷心肠”和“对几百万失业者的痛苦熟视无睹”，责备它不努力为失业者“创造就业的机会”。接着，马萨诸塞州的民主党参议员肯尼迪（1960年民主党的可能的总统候选人）就提出了一个增加失业救济金的法案。然后，明尼苏达州的民主党参议员就开始抨击现政府的“贫乏而毫无魄力的政策”……
    在国会外面，民主党人也配合着向共和党政府展开进攻。新泽西州的民主党州长迈尔2月初在华盛顿的全国新闻俱乐部大骂艾森豪威尔政府在应付衰退方面毫无作为。在纽约，史蒂文森也叫嚷说：共和党一贯在隐瞒和歪曲实际情况。杜鲁门则在民主党全国委员会会议上把“萧条”的标签竭力钉牢在共和党政府的额上，他说：“1873、1893……1929年……几乎每一次危机都是共和党执政时期搞出来的。”
    在这样一片叫骂声中，共和党人终于出来反击了。他们指责民主党人是胆小鬼，悲观主义者，是专门散布阴霾气氛并把美国带向战争的政党；并说他们才应当对这次经济衰退负责。
    但是，1月份的失业人数陡增了一百一十二万的消息传来了。于是，舆论沸腾，共和党政府不能不有些慌乱了。艾森豪威尔赶忙发表了“关于目前美国经济情况的声明”，向美国公众开出了一个增加政府开支以应付衰退的长长的帐单：军事订货增加五十八亿美元，公路建筑增加六亿美元，公共工程增加……可是这个帐单却是一种遮眼法。因为帐单内容不过是1月份的新预算中所列数字的重复，其中并没有新货色。这当然瞒不过民主党政客们的眼睛。因此，就在声明发表的第二天，以纽约州州长哈里曼为首的十一个民主党州长联名打电报给艾森豪威尔，要求他采取一项更加有力的“实际计划”，来挽救危局。同时参院民主党人为了向选民显示他们比共和党更关心人民的疾苦，也在他们的领袖约翰逊的指导下在一片鼓噪声中提出了各色各样增加政府开支来进行住房建筑、清除贫民窟、防洪、开荒……的新计划。
    显然，共和党在这场斗争中是处于劣势的。它是执政党，要想在花钱上同民主党竞赛，显然是在“搬起砖头砸自己的脚”。于是共和党政府就不得不在艾森豪威尔开出第一次帐单以后赶快煞车，改变战略。先由尼克松发表声明说，反衰退措施的“行动过快和范围太广只能导致通货膨胀的恢复”，接着艾森豪威尔也改变腔调说：美国“经济的真正原动力不是政府，而是私营企业的内在推动力和活力。”
    可是尽管如此，失业人数的猛烈上升，使得艾森豪威尔政府在舆论的压力下不得不硬着头皮，一次又一次地继续开出一些稳定人心的反衰退帐单，来应付门面。
    不过这种打被动仗、跟着民主党跑的做法却使共和党在选民面前信誉更加扫地。这对于将代表共和党在1960年竞选总统的尼克松的“政治前程”来说，显然是一种莫大的威胁。为了哗众取宠，在选民面前争取主动，这位野心勃勃的副总统终于顾不得共和党政府的实际财政困难，打出了为艾森豪威尔所不敢打出的一张王牌：减税。尼克松在3月10日向新闻记者表示：“完全依靠公共工程的办法太慢，太不保险，而且可能是无效的”，并表示他个人“赞成减税”。在尼克松之后，劳工部长密契尔跟着散布了政府将实行减税的消息。
    尼克松和密契尔抛出的这张减税王牌，主要原是给选民们看的，但是这却同“增加政府开支来应付经济衰退”的那张牌一样，只能使共和党政府自己吃更大的苦头。原来在国会民主党人的口袋中已经藏有各种减税的计划。只要参众两院的民主党领袖约翰逊和雷朋略一示意，这些计划就可以立即拿出来，作为进攻共和党的武器。因此共和党要想在减税问题上同民主党斗法，实际上是在自寻倒运。
    因此在尼克松放出了“减税”的一炮以后，着慌的不是民主党人，反而是共和党政府的阁员们。
    首先是白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂连忙出来矢口否认政府有任何减税计划。参院共和党领袖诺兰更斩钉截铁地表示：“至少要在两个月之后政府才会对减税作出决定。”财政部长安德逊并在美国总统的授意下，连夜登门造访了他的同乡、众院民主党领袖雷朋和参院民主党领袖约翰逊（他们三个都是得克萨斯州人），当面解释误会，并且赔礼，说尼克松和密契尔的话不能作数，因为只有他，财政部长安德逊才是减税问题的权威发言人。接着在进行了几次秘密折冲以后，双方很快就宣布了一个所谓“君子协定”：两党今后在提出减税计划以前，必须经过事先协商。安德逊并保证以后决不再会有尼克松、密契尔所干过的这类情事发生。
    华盛顿的两党鏖战就这样在共和党的退让下，以一项所谓“君子协定”暂告结束。但是陷在水深火热中的美国几百万失业家庭的灾难却有增无已。华盛顿的两党政客们尽可以用人民的痛苦作为他们玩弄政治把戏的工具，可是随着经济危机的加深，一场激烈的政治暴风雨就会使他们的一切幻想化为乌有。
