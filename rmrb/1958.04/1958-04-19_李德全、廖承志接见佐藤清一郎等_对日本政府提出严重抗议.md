Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, and Liao Chengzhi, Advisor, received Sato Seiichiro, the head of the Japanese Eighth Group for Escorting the Ashes of Chinese Martyrs, Vice-Head Umino Saburo, Suenaga Tatsuichi, and all members of the group, as well as Takagi Buzaburo, representative of the Japanese Red Cross Society, Tanaka Seiichi, representative of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Nakahara Junji, representative of the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and thirteen Japanese journalists on the 17th and 18th respectively.

During the reception, Li Dequan and Liao Chengzhi expressed their gratitude to the Japanese people and Japanese friendly organizations for returning the ashes of Chinese martyrs and assisting Liu Lianren in returning to his motherland. Li Dequan pointed out that the Japanese government, especially Nobusuke Kishi, not only did not admit guilt in the Liu Lianren incident, but also insulted Liu Lianren in various ways, saying that he entered the country illegally. This attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Li Dequan lodged a strong protest to the Japanese government, pointing out that the Japanese government should give a responsible account of the Liu Lianren incident and be responsible for compensating Liu Lianren's losses.

During the reception, Liao Chengzhi also severely condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's behavior of undermining the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and refuted the Japanese government's various lies attempting to shift the responsibility for undermining the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement to the Chinese side.

The members of the Japanese Eighth Group for Escorting the Ashes of Chinese Martyrs and the representatives of the three Japanese organizations came to Beijing from Tianjin on the 16th, and they left Beijing tonight to return to Tianjin. The person in charge of the Chinese Red Cross Society held three talks with the representatives of the three Japanese organizations.

    接见时，李德全和廖承志对日本人民和日本友好团体送还中国烈士骨灰和协助刘连仁回到祖国表示感谢。李德全指出，日本政府特别是岸信介对刘连仁事件不仅不认罪，并且以各种办法侮辱刘连仁，说他非法入境，这种敌视中国人民的态度是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。李德全对日本政府提出了严重抗议，指出日本政府应对刘连仁事件作出负责交代，并负责赔偿刘连仁的损失。
    廖承志在接见时还严厉地谴责岸信介政府破坏第四次中日贸易协定的行为，并且驳斥了日本政府企图把破坏中日贸易协定的责任推卸给中国方面的种种谎言。
    日本第八批中国殉难烈士骨灰护送团人员和日本三团体代表是在16日由天津前来北京的，他们已在今晚离开北京返回天津。中国红十字会负责人曾先后同日本三团体代表举行三次会谈。
