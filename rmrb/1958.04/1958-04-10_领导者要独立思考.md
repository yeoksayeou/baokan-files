    Leaders Must Think Independently
    Tian Lianqian
    Most counties in Shanxi Province have experienced fluctuating grain production, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing, over the past five years due to continuous disasters. However, Gao Ping County has achieved continuous production increases for five years under the same conditions, without any declines or stagnation. Gao Ping County has many good experiences that are worth learning from by other regions.
    In the first half of 1957 and in previous years, it seemed that a wave of "anti-rash advance" was being stirred up every year. After this wave passed, it did not actually lead to more planned and orderly steady progress, but rather to a complete halt in progress, or even a backward slide. The situation in the latter half of 1956 was like this. In order to strive for a bumper harvest in the first year after agricultural production cooperativization, various regions adopted a series of production-increasing measures in the spring of 1956, such as planting more high-yield crops, using improved varieties, expanding the area of multiple cropping, appropriately dense planting, using new-style farm implements (such as double-wheeled double-share plows), and promoting many other advanced technologies and experiences. It was precisely because of these measures that our country overcame serious natural disasters and achieved increased production in 1956. However, in the second half of the year, a gust of wind suddenly came, saying that this was rash and that was rash, and all the production-increasing measures, new technologies, new experiences, and even new farm implements like double-share plows, seemed to be wrong. The "Forty Articles" that had greatly inspired the socialist enthusiasm of the peasants in the first half of the year were also implicitly blown away, quietly, without anyone mentioning them.
    From the winter of that year until the spring of 1957, activities such as water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, and soil improvement in most areas were far less active than in the previous year. High-yield crops, improved varieties, and the area of multiple cropping were greatly reduced in 1957, and production-increasing measures such as appropriate dense planting, other new technologies, new experiences, and new farm implements were mostly discontinued. The reduction in production in most counties of Shanxi was due to both severe natural disasters and the "regression" caused by the anti-rash advance.
    On this issue, the leading comrades and cadres and masses of Gao Ping County were not swept away by this wave and did not drift with the tide; they made a calm and independent analysis and study of the actual situation at the time, and believed that the deviations were not large, but the successes were great. They bravely fought back against the "terrible theory" that reflected the sentiments of the well-to-do middle peasants, and affirmed and adhered to the advanced things. Production-increasing measures such as rational close planting and multiple cropping were not only not overthrown in 1957, but were further promoted. Their ability to stand firm in the face of the adverse current of anti-rash advance was an important reason for their continued increase in production in 1957.
    Revolutionaries should be the most daring to think independently and go against the tide. But many of our comrades do not understand or have forgotten this point. When a big wind blows, they lose their heads. They only hear what others are saying, but rarely use their own brains to think about whether what others are saying is right, whether it conforms to the facts, and whether it is beneficial to production, socialist construction, and the country and the people.
    Chairman Mao often taught us to seek truth from facts. To understand "facts," we must use our own brains to investigate and understand; to "seek" the "truth" (objective laws), we must use our own brains to "seek" (research and explore). This requires, first of all, a correct way of thinking, being good at grasping the essence of things, grasping the mainstream, and not being confused by phenomena or swayed by side currents. At the same time, it also requires a spirit of fearless perseverance, not being shaken because other places are already doing this or that. Even if in the end only oneself is left, if there is indeed sufficient evidence, one should persevere to the end. In the arena of fighting for truth, a fighting materialist should believe that he will ultimately win, and he will never be afraid. Because he has irrefutable investigative materials in his hands. And those who are unwilling to go deep into reality, go deep among the masses to do investigation and research, those who suffer from subjectivism and bureaucratism, they are not true materialists, they cannot stand firm, and they will be blown east and west by the wind at any time. To be a qualified leader of the people, one must be a thorough materialist who seeks truth from facts.

    领导者要独立思考
    田连阡
    山西省多数县份因为不断受灾，五年来粮食产量时降时升，很不稳定。而高平县却在同样条件下连续五年增产，从未下降或停滞。高平县有许多好的经验值得各地学习。
    在1957年上半年和以前的几年中，似乎每年都要吹一次“反冒进”的风。这股风吹过之后，实际上并不是更有计划更有秩序地稳步前进，而是干脆停止前进，甚至向后倒退了。1956年后半年的情形就是这样的。为了争取农业生产合作化以后第一年的丰收，1956年春间各地都采取了一系列的增产措施，诸如多种高产作物，优良品种，扩大复种面积，适当密植，使用新式农具（如双轮双铧犁），以及其他许多先进技术、先进经验的推广，等等。正因为有这些，1956年我们国家战胜了严重的自然灾害而取得了增产。但是后半年忽然来了一阵风，说是这儿冒了，那儿冒了，所有的增产措施、新技术、新经验，以至双铧犁之类的新农具，似乎统统都不对了。上半年曾经大大地鼓舞了农民社会主义热情的“四十条”，也无形中给吹掉了，静悄悄地，没人提了。
    这年的冬季一直到1957年春，大部分地区兴修水利和积肥、改良土壤等活动，都远不如上一年度活跃。高产作物，优良品种和复种面积，1957年都大大减少了，适当密植等增产措施，其他新技术，新经验，新农具，大半都停止推广了。山西大部县份的减产，一方面是自然灾害重，一方面也和反冒进引起的“倒退”有关。
    在这个问题上，高平县的领导同志和干部群众没有被这股风给卷走，随波逐流；他们对当时的实际情况作了冷静的独立的分析研究，认为偏差并不大，而成功却很大。他们勇敢地反击了反映富裕中农情绪的“糟糕论”，肯定了和坚持了先进的东西。合理密植和复种等增产措施，在1957年不但没有被打倒，而且更进一步推广了。他们在反冒进的逆流中能够牢固地站定脚根，是1957年继续取得增产的重要原因。
    革命者应该是最敢于独立思想和逆流而进的。但我们有不少同志不懂得或者是忘记了这一点。大风一起，他们就没了主意。只听得人家都说这个那个，自己却很少动脑筋思考一下人家都说得对不对，合不合事实，对生产、对社会主义建设、对国家和人民有没有好处。
    毛主席时常教导我们要实事求是。“实事”要自己动脑筋去调查了解，“是”（客观规律）要自己动脑筋去“求”（研究探讨）。这里首先要有正确的思想方法，要善于抓住事物的本质，抓住主流，而不被现象所迷惑，不为支流所左右。同时还需要有一种大无畏的坚持精神，不要因为别处都已经如何如何而动摇。即使最后只剩了自己一人，如果确有充分根据，就应当坚持到底。在为真理而斗争的场合，一个战斗的唯物主义者应当相信自己最后一定胜利，他决不害怕。因为他手里有不可推翻的调查材料。而那些不愿意深入实际、深入群众去做调查研究的人，害了主观主义病和官僚主义病的人，他们不是真正的唯物主义者，他们也就站不牢脚根，他们随时都会被风吹得东倒西歪。要想充当人民群众的称职的领导者，就必定要做实事求是的彻底唯物主义者。
