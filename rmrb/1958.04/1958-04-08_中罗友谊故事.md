    Sino-Romanian Friendship Stories

    Selfless Assistance
    Romania possesses many advanced technologies and experiences in socialist construction, especially in the petroleum and chemical industries, some of which have reached world standards. Last year, our country sent several professional delegations from the petroleum, chemical, construction, and health departments to Romania for visits, inspections, and study. They received a warm welcome from the Romanian people and successfully completed their missions.
    Romanian comrades displayed brotherly enthusiasm and selflessness in receiving Chinese guests. The Chinese petroleum expert delegation inspected Romania for two months. As they departed, they said, "We have seen many things this time. Comrades in the Romanian petroleum industry showed us everything they had, greatly broadening our horizons. There are many things worth learning from Romania."
    Our chemical expert delegation inspected Romania for more than five months. Before their departure, they also told reporters, "Romanian comrades are willing to show us all their best things without any reservation. Their attitude is sincere and humble; they say what they know and never exaggerate their achievements." Our expert comrades also said that during their inspection, everyone from ministers to librarians, data clerks, blueprint operators, and translators provided them with great assistance.
    From these vivid examples, it can be seen how much the Romanian people love their Chinese brothers.
                  They Fell in Love with China
    The "Thälmann Tractor Factory" in Stalin City has produced over a thousand tractors for China. I visited it not long ago. The editor-in-chief of the factory newspaper told me that there was a tractor expert in their factory who loved China as much as he loved his own family and wanted to stay and work in China for life. After returning from China, he gave many reports to the factory workers and wrote several articles in the factory newspaper, introducing China's socialist construction, the new ideas, and new customs of the Chinese people. Later, I learned that this expert was Comrade Zielinski, a fellow traveler on my journey from Beijing to Romania in 1956. He participated in tractor training classes in Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Taiyuan, and other places, training more than eight hundred Chinese students. At that time, we talked enthusiastically about China and Romania on the train, unknowingly completing the long journey.
    A few days ago, we visited Comrade Zielinski's home. He earnestly told us that he was very willing to work in China and could leave at any time if the higher authorities transferred him. In his rest room, there was a strong "Chinese flavor." Chinese paintings hung on the walls, Chinese vases were placed on the table, and photos of him with his Chinese students were displayed.
    In recent years, Romania has sent many scholars and experts to our country to help with construction. China has left a deep impression on them, and they have fallen in love with China like Zielinski. The Romanian virologist Academician Nicolau is one of them. He has lectured in China twice. After returning to his country, he told people everywhere, "China is my second homeland, and I will never forget her." Now he is very enthusiastically cultivating Chinese medical graduate students who are studying here.
                  My First Guide
  　In Romania, many comrades have acted as my guide. But my first guide was an anonymous young woman. More than a year ago, the delegation of the National People's Congress of our country visited Târgu Mureș, the capital of the Hungarian Autonomous Region in Romania. After the delegation finished its visit, they went to eat and rest, preparing to take the train back to Bucharest. In order to send the news of the visit from the local area to Bucharest and then to Beijing immediately, I left the delegation to write the manuscript on the train. But when I finished writing and returned to the city to send the manuscript, I didn't know where the delegation had gone. I walked hurriedly along several streets but couldn't find them. I was very anxious, fearing that the news wouldn't be sent and that I would be separated from the group. Later, I entered a crowded theater and met an old man inside who could speak a few words of Russian. After he understood the reason, he took me to the street to ask people and make phone calls. In the cold street, the old man was sweating profusely. Finally, he found out from the phone call. He happily took me to his home, called out his daughter, and asked her to take me to find the delegation. This young woman walked with me for a long time and finally found the delegation in a hotel. The young woman handed me over to the doorman of the hotel properly. When I was about to say "thank you," she had already walked away with a smile.
                  The First Matchmaker
    The people of China and Romania, separated by thousands of miles, have been in contact for a long time, but Romanian comrades often talk about the story of Nicolae Milescu when talking about the relationship between China and Romania. Nicolae Milescu was a scholar from the Moldavian region of Romania and the first Romanian to visit China. On March 3, 1675, Nicolae Milescu, as an envoy of the Russian Tsar, led a delegation from Moscow, crossed eight thousand Russian miles of long journey, and reached Beijing on May 15, 1676. Although he did not fulfill the mission of the envoy later, after he returned to Romania, he wrote his impressions of China. Later Romanians began to learn more about China from his impressions.
    From Nicolae Milescu until the liberation, there was little contact between the people of China and Romania.
    But now, friendship envoys between the people of China and Romania are constantly traveling back and forth. Romanian friends who have visited our country always hold report meetings or write articles for newspapers and periodicals to introduce their experiences in China after returning home. From 1950 to the present, Romania has published nine books by famous writers, social activists, and journalists who have visited China, introducing China. These books have been warmly welcomed by the majority of readers. (Attached picture)

    中罗友谊故事
    本报记者　丁曼
    无私的帮助
    罗马尼亚在社会主义建设中有许多先进的技术和经验，特别是在石油和化学工业方面，有些已经达到世界水平。去年我国曾派遣了石油、化学、建筑和卫生等部门的几个专业代表团到罗马尼亚参观、考察和学习。他们受到了罗马尼亚人民的热情接待，顺利地完成了自己的任务。
    罗马尼亚同志对接待中国客人表现了兄弟般的热情和大公无私。中国石油专家考察团在罗马尼亚考察了两个月，他们在离开这里时说：“我们这次看了许多东西，罗马尼亚石油工业部门的同志，把他们的一切都拿出来让我们看，大大扩大了我们的眼界。罗马尼亚有许多值得我们学习的东西。”
    我们的化学专家考察团在罗马尼亚考察了五个多月。他们在行前也告诉记者说：“罗马尼亚的同志愿意把自己所有的好东西都拿出来给我们看，一点也不保留。他们的态度诚恳、谦虚，有什么就说什么，绝不夸大自己的成就。”我们的专家同志还说，在他们考察期间，从部长到图书馆管理员、资料员、晒图员和翻译员都给了他们很大帮助。
    从这些生动的事例中，可以看出罗马尼亚人民是多么热爱他们的中国兄弟。
                  他们爱上了中国
    斯大林城“台尔曼拖拉机工厂”曾经为中国生产了千台以上的拖拉机，不久以前我访问了它。工厂厂报的总编辑告诉我说，他们工厂里有位拖拉机专家，像爱自己家里人一样爱上了中国，想终生都留在中国工作。他从中国回来以后曾向厂里职工们作过好多次报告，还在厂报上写了好几篇文章，介绍中国的社会主义建设情况、中国人民的新思想和新风俗。后来我才知道，这位专家是捷林斯基同志，是1956年我从北京来罗马尼亚时的同路朋友。他参加过北京、天津、武汉、太原等地的拖拉机训练班，前后训练了八百多名中国学生。当时我们在火车上兴致勃勃地谈着中国，谈着罗马尼亚，不知不觉地走完了万里旅程。
    前些日子我们曾到捷林斯基同志家里作客。他认真地向我们说，他非常愿意到中国去工作，只要上级调他，随时都可以走。在他的休息室里，“中国风味”很浓，墙上挂着中国画，桌上摆着中国花瓶以及他同他的中国学生一起拍的照片。
    几年来，罗马尼亚派了不少学者、专家到我国帮助建设，中国给他们留下了深刻的印象，他们也像捷林斯基一样爱上了中国。罗马尼亚的病毒学家尼古劳院士也是其中的一个，他到中国讲过两次学，他回国后到处向人说：“中国是我的第二祖国，我永远不会忘记她。”现在他正在非常热心地培养着在这里学习的中国医学研究生。
                  我的第一位向导
  　在罗马尼亚，许多同志当过我的向导。但是我的第一位向导却是个不知名姓的姑娘。一年多以前的一天，我国全国人民代表大会代表团到罗马尼亚的匈牙利自治州首府特尔古木别什访问，代表团访问完毕后就去吃饭和休息，准备乘火车回布加勒斯特。为了把访问消息能从当地立刻发到布加勒斯特转北京，我离开代表团到火车上去写稿，但写完回到市区发稿时，代表团不知到哪里去了。我匆匆忙忙地走了好几条街都没找到，非常着急，怕消息发不出，又怕掉了队。后来，我走进了一个人们拥挤的大剧院，在里边遇到了一位会讲几句俄语的老人，他问明原因后就带我到街上到处问人，打电话。在寒冷的大街上，老人忙得直出汗。最后终于从电话里问到了，他高兴地带着我跑到他的家里，叫出他的女儿，让她带我去找代表团，这位姑娘和我走了很久，才在一家招待所里找到了代表团，那位姑娘把我妥贴地交给了招待所的看门人。当我准备说声“谢谢”的时候，她已经笑着走开了。
                  第一个牵线人
    相隔万里之遥的中罗两国人民，已在很久以前就有了联系，但是罗马尼亚的同志在谈到中罗两国的关系时常谈到尼·米列斯库的故事。尼·米列斯库是罗马尼亚的摩尔达维亚区的一个学者，是第一个到过中国的罗马尼亚人。时在1675年3月3日，尼·米列斯库作为俄国沙皇的特使率领一个代表团离开了莫斯科，经过八千俄里的长途跋踄，1676年5月15日到达北京。虽然后来他没有完成特使的使命，但是在他返回罗马尼亚以后，写了中国印象记，后来的罗马尼亚人从他的印象记里开始较多地了解了中国。
    尼·米列斯库以后直到解放为止的年代中，中罗两国人民来往很少。
    但是现在，中罗两国人民的友谊使者，不断往还。访问过我国的罗马尼亚朋友，回国后总是经常举行报告会，或者给报刊写文章，介绍他们在中国的见闻。从1950年到现在，罗马尼亚已出版了九本由访问过中国的著名作家、社会活动家和记者写的介绍中国的书籍。这些书受到了广大读者的热烈欢迎。（附图片）
