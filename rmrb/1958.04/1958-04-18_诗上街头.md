    Poetry Takes to the Streets
    Zang Kejia
    Amidst the sound of drums and horns of the Great Leap Forward, poetry has leaped onto the streets.
    On the walls of Hebei's villages, on the screen walls of Beijing's streets… street poetry has appeared. These poems are short and pithy, simple and unadorned, standing on the streets, calling out in powerful voices to passersby. Many people stop here, reading these lines one by one. They are very attractive because they timely coordinate with political calls, such as greening, spring plowing, and opening canals…. Poets, with their sensitivity and enthusiasm, with their personal experiences and fantasies, have written these poems. Although they are only a few lines long, they can strike the heart and inspire people.
    Street poetry has a glorious combat tradition. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in Yan'an, in the liberated villages, Comrade Tian Jian and many other poets used this short weapon to fight and achieved good results. Some of those poems were only two or three sentences long, but they grasped the core of the problem, expressed the people's emotions, and used the language of the masses, instantly capturing people. More than a decade after the victory of the War of Resistance, people still remember these poems. They have significant political meaning, and they have the immortal magic of art.
    All literature and art serve politics. Poetry is even more direct and timely. And street poetry is the vanguard on the poetry front.
    All literature and art should serve the masses. Street poetry has a particularly close relationship with the masses; it is the people's eyes and the people's voice.
    The great activity of street poetry today is by no means accidental. This is the era of the Great Leap Forward, this is the great creative era filled with the heroic spirit of revolution, this is the era of boiling blood and fantastic imaginations, this is the era of poetry. Farmers have created a large number of poems in their struggle against nature, creating a flourishing situation and forming a new national style of the socialist era; workers and cadre comrades use poetry to write big-character posters, using it as a sharp weapon to express their thoughts and feelings. Many poets have gone down to the grassroots. Many poets have gone to construction sites and villages. The bright and splendid prospects of life, the hardworking people full of vigor, have given poets infinite strength and spring-like inspiration. Poets live among the working people as one of them. In life, in labor, in emotion, they are slowly integrating with the working people. Encouraged by the working people, and driven, inspired, and stimulated by the poetry creation of the working people, poets write a large number of poems and post them on the walls and streets.
    Street poetry inherits the excellent traditions of the past, but it must move forward further. Because the times are moving forward. Street poetry must have a strong political nature, and timely reflect the real events that everyone cares about, but it cannot be written in a way that is indistinguishable from slogans. It should use forms and colloquial language that the masses like to hear and see, and it must reach a considerable artistic level! It is not enough to just ask that everyone can understand it and finish reading it; it must be full of artistic magic, grasping people forever. In the past, poets almost all had their own set of styles, the patterns were different, but the inability to reach the masses was the same. Today, poets are changing their lives, changing their thoughts and feelings, and also changing their poetic style.
    Folk song style, quick-board style, or short sentences of three or two words, are generally the best forms for street poetry. This does not mean that only such forms can be used. Forms should be diversified, based on the masses' ability to accept and like them.
    Street poetry is the best means of popularizing poetry; it stands on the streets and directly meets the masses. As mentioned above, it is loved by the people, not only because it is relatively popular, but more importantly because the thoughts and feelings it expresses are in the same vein as the people, and the reality and struggles it reflects are precisely what the people are most concerned about and are working hard to achieve.
    Currently, many poets are writing street poetry, forming a new poetic style, which is gratifying. After reading some street poems, I feel that many are profound and simple, and are indeed good poems. However, some still have many shortcomings in terms of imagery and language. If they use vivid and novel images and lively language, like some of the works created by the farmers themselves, they will be even more welcomed.
    Street poetry is currently just developing. We should first affirm its popularization significance and not demand too much. It will definitely improve step by step in the process of moving forward. Some works that are loved by the masses have already been produced, and through the reprint of newspapers and periodicals, radio recordings, and public recitations, they are having an impact. In the future, there will definitely be more and better street poetry!

    诗上街头
    臧克家
    在大跃进的鼓角声中，诗，一跃跃上了街头。
    在河北农村的墙头上，在北京街头的映壁上……出现了街头诗。这些诗，短小精悍，朴素无华，站在街头上，用有力的声音向过路的人们呼喊。许多人走到这里停下了脚步，一句一句的诵读着这些诗句。它们是很吸引人的，因为它们及时地配合了政治号召，像绿化，春耕，开渠……。诗人们凭了敏感和热情，凭了亲身体会和幻想，写了这些诗。它们虽然短短几行，却能打进心坎，使人鼓舞。
    街头诗是有着它们光荣战斗传统的。抗战期间，在延安，在解放过的乡村，田间同志和别的许多诗人就曾经运用这短小的武器作过战，取得了很好的效果。那些诗，有的仅只两三句，它抓住了问题的中心，表现了人民的情感，用群众的语言表达出来，一下子就把人抓住了。抗战胜利已经十几年了，人们还记得这些诗。它有重大的政治意义，它有艺术的不死魔力。
    一切文艺都服从政治。诗，更直接、更及时。街头诗呢，又是诗阵地上的尖兵。
    一切文艺都应该为群众服务。街头诗，它和群众的关系特别密切，它是人民的眼睛，人民的心声。
    街头诗在今天大活跃，决不是偶然的。这是大跃进的时代，这是革命英雄气概充沛的大创造时代，这是热血奔腾、幻想奇出的时代，这是诗的时代。农民在对自然斗争中创造了大批诗歌，情况繁盛，形成了社会主义时代的新国风；工人和干部同志们，用诗歌写大字报，把它作为抒发思想情感的利器。许多诗人下放了。许多诗人走到了工地上、乡村里去。光华灿烂的生活远景，干劲冲天的劳动人民，给了诗人们以无限的力量和泉水似的灵感。诗人们就生活在劳动人民中间，作为其中的一分子。在生活上，在劳动上，在情感上，慢慢地在和劳动人民结合。在劳动人民的鼓励下，在劳动人民诗歌创作的推动、启发、刺激之下，诗人们大量写诗，把这些诗贴到墙头上、街头上去。
    街头诗承接着过去的优良传统，但必须再前进一步。因为，时代更前进了。街头诗一定要具有强烈的政治性，及时地反映人人关怀的现实事件，可是不能把它写得和标语口号没有分别。运用群众喜闻乐见的形式和口语化的语言，还要达到相当的艺术水平！不光要求人人看得懂，念出口就完事，必须富有艺术的魔力，抓住人永远不放。过去，诗人差不多各有自己一套，花样虽各异，但不能打入群众的情况是不二致的。今天，诗人们在改变生活，在改变思想情感，也在改变自己的诗风。
    民歌体，快板体，或者是三言两语的短句，一般地讲是街头诗最好的形式。这并不是说，只能用这样的形式。形式应该多样化，以群众的接受能力和喜爱做标准。
    街头诗是诗歌大众化的最好手段，它站在街头上直接和群众见面。上面说过，它为人民所喜爱，并不仅仅因为它比较通俗，更重要的是它表达的思想情感和人民一脉相通，它反映的现实和斗争，正是人民最关心最注意并且正在致力的。
    目前，许多诗人在写街头诗，形成一种新的诗风，这是值得高兴的。看了一些街头诗之后，觉得有许多深入浅出，确是好诗。但有一些在形象、语言方面还存在着不少缺点，如果用鲜明新颖的形象，生动活泼的语言，像农民自己所创造的某些作品那样，那一定会受到更大的欢迎。
    街头诗目前刚刚在发展，我们首先应该肯定它的普及意义，不能要求过高，在前进的过程中它一定会步步提高。现在已经产生了一些为群众所喜爱的作品，通过报刊的转载，广播录音和大会朗诵在发生影响，将来一定会有更多更好的街头诗出现！
