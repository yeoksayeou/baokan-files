　　Hongyang Cooperative Establishes a Year-Round Rational Fertilization Plan

　　(Our Newspaper News) According to a report from the New Hunan Daily: The Hongyang Cooperative in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, has formulated a fertilization plan for this year based on the principles of rational fertilization.

　　The Hongyang Cooperative has more than two thousand mu of fields. According to the terrain, soil quality, and team station conditions, they are classified as: (1) Deep paddy fields, which do not dry out throughout the year, have strong fertilizer retention, and slow fertilizer decomposition. (2) Shallow fields, with sufficient sunlight, warm soil, and strong fertilizer tolerance. (3) Sandy fields, which are not suitable for applying large amounts of fertilizer at once.

　　From the perspective of fertilizers: quick-acting fertilizers include topsoil, old wall soil, granular fertilizers, and human and animal manure; slow-acting fertilizers include soil fertilizer and sod. Cool-natured fertilizers include soil fertilizer, pond mud, ditch mud, old wall soil, stove soil, and dust; warm-natured fertilizers include sod, soil ash, cattle manure, and chicken and duck manure.

　　From the perspective of rice varieties, there are also distinctions between those that are fertilizer-tolerant and those that are not, as well as the hardness and weakness of the stalks.

　　Based on the classification and analysis of field quality, fertilizers, and rice varieties, the fertilization plan is as follows:
　　(1) For all the deep paddy fields in the cooperative, due to the low soil temperature and the difficulty for rice roots to develop, and the slow effectiveness of the applied fertilizer, it has been decided to plant all cold-resistant japonica rice. These fields generally receive sand sod, pig and cattle manure, bone meal, and sulfur per mu.
　　(2) Shallow loamy soil fields, because of high temperature and fast fertilizer effectiveness, are mainly planted with indica rice. The basic fertilizer required is generally mud sod, soil fertilizer, garden soil, topsoil, pond mud, etc.
　　(3) Sandy fields have weak fertilizer retention and fertilizer is easily lost, resulting in poor rice root growth. For these fields, sod, pond mud, and garden soil mixed with cattle manure and bone meal are used as basic fertilizer to improve the soil and increase fertilizer retention.

　　In order to implement fertilization according to the plan, fertilizer application signs are placed in each paddy or plot of land, indicating: what type of field, what type of fertilizer to apply, when to apply it, how much to apply, and who is responsible. At the same time, the cooperative has established an evaluation and inspection committee, which conducts inspections every ten days. Each team is composed of the captain, experienced farmers, and technical instructors to form a fertilizer inspection group, which conducts random checks and appraisals at any time. For unreasonable fertilization in the previous stage, the entire cooperative will make unified adjustments, transferring surpluses and supplementing deficiencies.

### 看种下肥　看田下肥  虹阳社订出全年合理施肥规划

    看种下肥　看田下肥
    虹阳社订出全年合理施肥规划
    本报讯　新湖南报报道：湖南平江县虹阳社根据合理施肥的原则，制订了今年的施肥规划。
    虹阳社共有二千多亩田，按地形土质站队的情况是：（1）深脚烂泥田，长年不干水，保肥力强，肥料分解慢。（2）浅脚田，阳光足，泥热，耐肥力强。（3）沙田，不宜一次多下肥料。
    从肥料看：肥效快的有地皮泥、陈墙土、颗粒肥料、人畜粪等；肥效慢的有土肥、草皮等。带凉性的肥料是土肥、塘泥、阴沟泥、陈墙土、灶土、扬尘等；带热性的有草皮、土灰、牛粪、鸡鸭粪泥等。
    从稻谷品种上看，也有耐肥不耐肥、秆的硬弱等分别。
    按照对田质、肥料和稻谷品种的排队分析，施肥的规划是：
      （1）对全社深脚烂泥田，因泥温低，禾根不易发达，施下的肥料冲性不快，决定全种耐寒的粳稻。这种田一般每亩下沙草皮、猪牛粪、骨粉、硫磺。
      （2）浅泥壤土田，因温度高，肥效冲得快，这种田以种籼稻为主。需要的基肥一般是泥草皮、土肥、菜园土、地皮、塘泥等。
      （3）沙质田保肥力弱，肥料易流失，稻根生长不好。这种田下草皮、塘泥、菜园土加牛粪、骨粉混合制成基肥，改变土壤，增加保肥力。
    为了做到按规划施肥，将全社每丘或每片田都插上肥料施放牌子，内容是：什么田，施什么肥，什么时候施，各要多少，由什么人负责。同时，社内成立了评比检查委员会，十天检查一次，各队由队长、老农和技术指导员组成肥料检验组，随时抽查鉴定。对前段施肥不合理的，由全社统一调配，多的调出，缺的照补。
