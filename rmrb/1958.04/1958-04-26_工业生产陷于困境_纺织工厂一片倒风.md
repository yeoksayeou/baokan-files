A Glimpse of Hell—Taiwan

    Industrial Production Trapped in Difficulty
    Textile Factories Fall Like Dominoes

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th—Taiwanese newspapers report that Taiwan's industrial production is now in an extremely difficult situation, especially the private sector's daily necessities industries. Taking the textile industry as an example, hundreds of factories have closed down this spring alone. Taiwanese newspapers often use headlines such as "Many Difficulties," "Increasing Bankruptcies," and "A Scene of Depression" to describe the wave of textile factory closures in Taiwan. Many other industries are suffering the same tragic fate. Recently, figures in Taiwan's industrial circles have been repeatedly issuing calls to save the crisis, and Yang Jizeng, the Minister of Economic Affairs of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, said helplessly: Faced with the current economic depression, Taiwan's industrial production "has no other way to go."

    工业生产陷于困境
    纺织工厂一片倒风
    新华社广州25日电　台湾报纸报道，现在台湾的工业生产已经陷入极端困难的境地，特别是民营的生活用品工业。以纺织工业为例，在今年春季就倒闭了几百家。台湾报纸常常以“困难甚多”、“倒风日厉”、“一片萧条”等字句为标题，来描绘台湾纺织工厂纷纷倒闭的景象。其它许多行业也同样悲惨。最近台湾工业界人士纷纷发出挽救危机的呼吁，蒋介石集团经济部长杨继曾无可奈何地说：目前台湾工业生产在经济萧条面前“并无第二条路可走”。
