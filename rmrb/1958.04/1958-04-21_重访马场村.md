    Revisiting Machang Village
    Liu Qing
    Every morning when I get up to wash my face, I hear the rumbling of cannons. Later, while working, eating, planting vegetables, and resting, until dusk, I hear the sound of cannons intermittently. In this peaceful scene, just when the peach trees are blossoming and the willows are turning green, and there is clearly no enemy situation, what is going on?
    It turns out that the agricultural cooperative members of seven townships around Shenhe Plateau in Chang'an County are engaged in a "war" with Shenhe Plateau itself: to dig an S-shaped canal 28 kilometers long on Shenhe Plateau within two months, and then build 23 reservoirs of varying sizes, turning more than 40,000 mu of dry land on the plateau into paddy fields. From then on, the Hao River will flow into the Ju River via two routes: one opened up by Pangu, and the other opened up by the agricultural cooperative. The floodwaters of the rainy season will be subject to socialist control, not allowed to damage the farmland on both banks of the Hao River at will. The cannon sounds are coming from the Shibianyu pass of the Zhongnan Mountains, opening up a channel of solid rock for the Hao River to ascend the plateau. ...
    I went to the Machang construction site. This village was famous in the past for its large landlords, known as "The Ma family's mountains, the Yao family's houses, and the Guo family's silver measured by the dou." The Guo family was in Machang. Anyone who lived in old China knows which village had big landlords and which village had unlucky farmers, just like weeds can't grow under a big tree. Those selling bamboo and willow branches for basket weaving that you meet at the market in Wangqu, don't ask, most of them are from Machang; originally their home was in Machang, but they relied on the Zhongnan Mountains for a living. "Poor people wear tattered clothes and eat cold rice in the Zhongnan Mountains" refers to them. Although they were allocated land after the land reform, and the superiority of cooperation was demonstrated after collectivization, without water conservancy, and with some hilly land and terraces, increased production was greatly limited.
    On the way to Machang, I remembered the last time I went to Machang in the winter before last.
    Let me copy a short diary entry from December 24, 1956:
        "Most people in this village go to the mountains
    to cut bamboo in winter. Many people in the field talked to me
    about the hardship of cutting bamboo, which was hair-
    raising to hear!
          "In the mountains, they light
    a fire at night to sleep. Everyone squats around
    the fire in a circle, resting their heads
    on their knees to sleep.
    Sometimes it snows, and the wind blows the
    snow off the pine branches, falling on people's
    heads and burying them halfway. ...
        "It's so cold in the mountains! Hands freeze
    and can't grip the sickle handle, so they insert
    them under their clothes at the waist, using their
    own bellies to warm them up before cutting again.
          "One trip to the mountains takes five days.
    They need to bring six jin of flour pancakes. The money
    earned from the trip, after food, could only buy two
    sheng of corn in the old society to make porridge
    for the women and children at home. What else could they do?
    They were born in this place! Now it's good, now
    they can earn six yuan from a trip. ..."
    Dear readers, please don't feel bad after reading this diary entry. Now Machang is going to be irrigated! The Hao River water will make a semi-circle over the hills above this village. The canal goes around a hill from Jiangzhao Village in the southeast and enters Machang's boundary. After making an S-shape in Machang's fields, it passes through the boundaries of Yue Village and Xiaojiang Village before entering the plateau above Huangfu Village. Not only will it be irrigated, but in the south of Machang village, the hills form a natural reservoir, with 300 mu of wheat fields at its bottom, and several times that area at the top of the hills. Soon after, the women of Machang will sit on their kangs doing needlework, and when they open the window, they will see a mirror-like water surface. At that time, the water birds on the Hao River—white cranes, red cranes, blue storks, herons, and water crows—will all migrate to the Machang Reservoir to make a living.
    Now, as soon as I entered Machang, I was completely drawn in by the atmosphere of war. Those who arrived early were already moving in clusters on the top of the ridge, and the newcomers gathered in earth fields in various places, waiting to put down their luggage and enter the construction site. The men of Machang, including those who complained to me in the field last winter, had already gone to the construction site in the south. Old men and women were busy running around the village, serving as gracious hosts, welcoming fellow villagers from both sides of the Hao River and the Ju River. I asked two old men, three young women, and an old woman for directions in the village lanes, and they answered me clearly and positively without thinking in the midst of their busyness, telling me the courtyard where the Huangfu Village people's kitchen was located.
    A cooperative cadre from Dongfan Village stood on a dung pile, speaking to the cooperative members eating around one vegetable pot after another in the earth field:
    "The fellow villagers of Machang are warmly hosting us, so we must do the following while living in their yards: First, borrow and return things properly, so it will be easy to borrow again; second, absolutely do not defecate or urinate anywhere; third, do not make noise in their yards, disturbing the children sleeping; fourth, do not say nonsense while chatting idly in the yard, annoying their women; fifth, ... sixth..."
    I was fascinated listening by the roadside. The relationship between people in our society deeply moved me. You must know, those who are bowing their heads to eat and listen are farmers! In the five years that I have lived in this area, I have personally seen the farmers' spirits becoming more and more noble as their clothes become newer year by year.
    I came to the bottom of the future reservoir. For the time being, it is still wheat fields and dandelions blooming on the edges. Two families have been living here for more than eighty years, away from the village, and are now waiting for news, ready to move into the village at any time.
    I asked an old woman sitting on a stone roller outside her gate, making shoe soles:
    "How is it? Are you happy to be asked to tear down your house?"
    "My heavens! What kind of question are you asking?" She was very surprised by my backwardness and said, "I couldn't dream of such a good thing! Comrade, what do you do?"
    A young woman from another family next door cleverly said that I was from the Water Conservancy Bureau.
    I stated that I was not; I said that I was from Huangfu Village and came here to take a look.
    "Take a look at what?" The old woman said very seriously, "You people from Huangfu Village who eat rice look down on us Machang people who drink thin porridge. It's so difficult for a daughter to marry into Machang! Who knew that our days of drinking thin porridge would come to an end? And the days of eating rice are coming!"
    Old woman, please enlighten me! I am not ashamed. This is not because I am not originally from Huangfu Village, so I don't care; it is because your old woman's spirit, tone, and the spirit of the great Chinese people of our great era are very consistent.
    I found that I suddenly became like a romantic poet, gesticulating wildly and running through a road in the middle of a wheat field at the bottom of the future reservoir, and then running up the steep slope in the middle of the terraces where I couldn't push my bicycle, coming to the top of the hills. The Wangqu River and the Duqu River unfolded green on both the north and south sides, with patches of fiery red peach blossoms decorating both banks of the Hao River and the Ju River.
    I walked north along the canal project under construction. This is the work area of ​​Fanchuan Township, and people don't know me. Some people again thought I was from the Water Conservancy Bureau and asked me if they were building up to standard. My statement again met with serious instruction:
    "Then, please walk away from the canal! It's not good if the dirt gets on your pants..."
    I quickly complied. Dear readers, please believe that I have this minimum level of awareness. I am very happy, I am not ashamed. But a young man's words embarrassed me; he said to the person who had just instructed me that I was a writer, here to experience life.
    As soon as I heard the term "experience life," in this labor front, in the forest of shovels and hoes, my face flushed red, and I felt a hot flush, as if I had done something wrong.
    Since it has been said, I will frankly say that I came to write a "Song of the Great Leap Forward" for the People's Daily. Strolling around in such a situation, looking at the scenery, just as an admirer of labor, is shameless!

### 重访马场村

    重访马场村
    柳青
    每天清早起来洗脸的时候，就听见隆隆的炮声。以后在工作的时候，吃饭的时候，种菜的时候，和休息的时候，直到黄昏，都若断若续地听见炮响。一片和平景象，正是桃红柳绿时候，分明没有敌情；这是做什么呢？
    原来长安县神禾塬周围七个乡的农业社员和神禾塬之间，爆发了“战争”：要在两个月之内，在神禾塬上挖一条S形的长达二十八公里的水渠，接着修二十三个大小不等的蓄水库，使高原上的四万多亩干地变成水田。从此，镐河将经由两条路线流入潏河：一条是盘古开辟的，另一条是农业社开辟的。雨季的洪水将受社会主义管制，不许它任性地损坏镐河两岸的农田。炮响的地方就在终南山的石砭峪山口上，给镐河开辟上塬的坚石渠道。……
    我去马场工地。这个村在这一带过去以地主大闻名，所谓“马家的山、姚家的房、郭家的银子拿斗量”，那郭家就在这马场。在旧中国生活过来的人，谁都知道哪个村里地主大，哪个村里农民倒霉，就好像大树底下连杂草都不长一样。你在王曲街上逢集日碰见的那些卖竹子的和卖编筐用的枝条的，别问，大多数是马场的；原来他们家在马场，却靠终南山过日子。“人穷衣衫烂，终南山里吃冷饭”，说的就是他们。土改后虽然分得了土地，合作化后虽然显示了优越性，但是没有水利，还有些丘陵地和梯田，增产受着很大的限制。
    我在去马场的路上，就想起前年冬天我上次去马场的时候。
    让我把1956年12月24日的简短的日记抄在下面吧：
        “这村人到冬天多数进山
    割竹子。许多人在场里和我谈
    起割竹子的苦处，听了令人毛
    骨悚然！
          “在山里，晚上睡觉时燃
    起一堆火。大伙围着火蹲成一
    圈，把脑袋搁在膝盖上睡。
    有时下雪，风把松树枝叶上的
    积雪掀下来，落在人头上，把
    人埋半截。……
        “山里好冻人啊！手冻僵
    了，抓不住镰把了，就从腰下
    边衣襟底下插进去，用自己的
    肚皮暖一暖，再割。
          “进一回山，需要五天。
    要带六斤面的锅饼。出山挣得
    除过吃，在旧社会只能捞买二
    升玉米的钱，给屋里女人娃子
    熬糊糊喝。要不怎么办呢？生
    在这个地方哩嘛！现在好，现
    在出山能捞六块钱。……”
    亲爱的读者，你看了这段日记，请你不要难受。现在马场要水利化了！镐河水将要在这个村上头的丘陵顶上绕一个半圆形。渠道是从东南的江兆村绕过一个丘岭进入马场地界的。在马场的田地上绕一个S形以后，才经过岳村和小江村的地界进入皇甫村上头的高原。不仅水利化，在马场的村南，丘陵围成一个天然的蓄水库，它的底上有三百亩麦地，到丘陵岭上，面积就要大几倍。不久以后，马场的女人们坐在炕上做针线，推开窗子，就看见明镜一般的水面了。那时候，镐河上的水鸟——白鹤、红鹤、青鹳、鹭鸶和水鸦，都将迁移到马场水库来谋生了。
    现在，我一进马场，完全被战争的气氛吸引了。早到的人群已经一堆一簇在岭顶上蠕动了，新来的人群集合在各处的土场上，等待着放下行李进入工地。马场的男人们，包括前年冬天在场里和我诉苦的那些人早已到南边的工地去了。老汉和妇女满村奔波，作为殷勤的主人，招待从镐河和潏河两川倾村而来的乡亲们。我在村巷里向两个老汉、三个年轻妇女和一个老婆婆问过路，他们在忙碌中不假思索，清楚地、肯定地回答我皇甫村人的伙房所在的院落。
    东樊村的一个社干部站在一个粪堆上，向土场上围着一个一个菜盆子吃饭的社员们讲话：
    “马场的乡亲们热情招待咱们，咱们住在人家院里，一定要做到：第一，借东西好借好还，再借不难；第二，绝对不要随地大小便；第三，在人家院里不要喧哗，惊动人家睡觉的娃子；第四，在院里闲扯，不要说混话，惹人家妇女讨厌；第五，……第六……”
    我站在路边上听得入神。我们这个社会人与人的关系，深深地感动了我。要知道，在那里低头吃着饭听话的是农民啊！我在这一带住的五年以来，亲眼看见农民们随着衣服一年一年地新，精神也一年一年地更崇高了。
    我来到未来的水库底上。暂时，这里还是小麦和地边上正开花的蒲公英。有两家人家，离开村庄，在这里已经住了八十多年了，现在等待着消息，准备随时拆房进村。
    我问一个坐在大门外土场上的碌碡上抐鞋底的老婆婆：
    “怎么样？叫你拆房，你满意吗？”
    “我的天！看你问的啥话？”她大为吃惊我的落后，说：“做梦也梦不见这好的事！同志，你是做啥的？”
    旁边另一家的一个年轻妇女自作聪明，说我是水利局的。
    我声明我不是的；我说我是皇甫村人，到这里来看看的。
    “看什么？”老婆婆很严肃地说：“你们皇甫村吃大米的人瞧不起俺马场喝糊糊的人，闺女要嫁到马场来，你看那个难啊！哪知道俺们喝糊糊的日子也有完？吃大米的日子就来了！”
    老人家，你指教我吧！我不脸红。这倒并不是因为我从根儿不是皇甫村人，所以才不在乎；这是因为你老人家的神气、口气，和我们这个伟大的时代的伟大的中国人民的气魄非常相称。
    我发现我突然间像一个浪漫的诗人，手舞足蹈地跑过未来水库底上的一条麦地中间的道路，又跑上梯田中间的推不上去脚踏车的陡坡，来到丘岭之上。王曲川和杜曲川在南北两边碧绿地展开去，一片片火红的桃花点缀在镐河和潏河两岸。
    我沿着正在施工的渠道工程向北而行。这里是樊川乡的工区，人们不认识我。又有人以为我是水利局的，问我他们修得合格不合格。我的声明又遇到严肃地指教：
    “那末，请你离开渠道点走！把土丢到你裤子上不好……”
    我连忙遵命。亲爱的读者，请相信我有这点起码的觉悟。我很愉快，我不脸红。但是给一个年轻人一句话，把我说羞了；他对刚才指教我的人说，我是作家，来体验生活的。
    一听“体验生活”这个词儿，在这个劳动阵地上，在铁锹和钁头林中，我刷地红了脸，觉得热辣辣地发烧，好像做下屈理的事情。
    既然说破了，我就爽直说我是为了给人民日报写一篇“跃进之歌”而来的。在这样的场合闲逛，看风景，仅仅做为一个劳动的欣赏者，是没脸的！
