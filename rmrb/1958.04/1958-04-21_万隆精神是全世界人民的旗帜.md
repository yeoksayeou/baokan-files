    The Bandung Spirit is the Banner of People All Over the World

    Today marks the third anniversary of the Bandung Conference in April 1955. In these three years, the Asian and African people's heroic struggle for independence, peace, and friendship, and their brilliant achievements, have fully demonstrated that the "Bandung Spirit" has become a great call inspiring hundreds of millions of people around the world to oppose colonialism, oppose aggression, and practice peaceful coexistence. The progress of history increasingly highlights the epoch-making significance of the Bandung Conference.
    The Bandung Conference prominently and centrally expressed the common aspiration and firm determination of the Asian and African people to oppose colonialism and strive for and safeguard national independence. The conference issued the common voice of the Asian and African people, declaring that colonialism is a scourge that should be eradicated quickly, condemning foreign conquest, domination, and exploitation, and supporting the cause of freedom and independence of the people of all oppressed countries. In terms of striving for national independence, since the Bandung Conference, Malaya, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Ghana have achieved independence. The anti-colonial struggles in dependent countries and regions such as Algeria, Kenya, Oman, Cameroon, Uganda, Somaliland, Togo, and Zanzibar are unfolding widely and rising day by day. In all these struggles, the Asian and African people not only fought heroically and unremittingly for their respective independence but also gave each other enthusiastic support. This great friendship is a vivid manifestation of the "Bandung Spirit."
    The experience of the past three years has further proved that not only does the independence of oppressed nations need to be seized from the colonialists through unyielding and heroic struggle, but the independence that has already been achieved also requires a hundredfold vigilance and, when necessary, resolute struggle to maintain it, because the colonialists will never willingly admit defeat and will always try to stage a comeback by every possible means. In these three years, the Egyptian people victoriously repelled the armed aggression of Britain, France, and Israel, and the Syrian people heroically crushed the military threats and aggressive conspiracies orchestrated by the United States. Now, the Indonesian people are waging a major struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and oppose US intervention. These heroic and resolute struggles of the Asian and African people, the fact that the Eisenhower Doctrine became notorious and difficult to sell in just one year, and the vigorous rise of anti-colonial national independence movements in other countries and regions in Asia and Africa, eloquently demonstrate that the common awakening call of the Asian and African people sounded by the Bandung Conference has greatly raised the consciousness of the Asian and African people and inspired their fighting spirit. Today, every Asian and African person is filled with confidence and sees that colonialism has reached its twilight years, and the Asian and African people cannot tolerate the shackles of colonialism continuing to be placed on them.
    Since the Bandung Conference, the Asian and African people have further realized the significance of unity and mutual assistance from practical life. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and the African Independent States Conference held recently in Accra, the capital of Ghana, demonstrated the increasingly clear and firm anti-colonial stance of Asian and African countries and people, and showed that they are moving towards a road of closer and wider unity. These two conferences also showed that African countries and people have begun to step onto the international political stage as masters, which is a very gratifying thing.
    Safeguarding world peace is the common and ardent wish of the Asian and African people. The "Declaration on the Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation" adopted by the Bandung Conference was a huge contribution to the cause of world peace. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, initiated by China, India, and Myanmar in Asia, were developed into the Ten Principles of Peaceful Coexistence through the Bandung Conference, making the principles of peaceful coexistence more widely recognized internationally. In fact, peaceful coexistence is not only the wish of the Asian and African people but also the urgent demand of the vast majority of people around the world. The principle of peaceful coexistence has been increasingly widely recognized in recent years. In this regard, the Bandung Conference played an important role. On December 14, 1957, the United Nations General Assembly also adopted a resolution on peaceful coexistence. It is precisely because the Bandung Conference truly expressed the desire of the vast Asian and African people and even the people of the world to demand peaceful coexistence that the "Bandung Spirit" is in fact the spirit of the current era and the voice of the people of the world.
    People still remember that shortly after the Bandung Conference, a summit meeting of the heads of government of the four powers was held in Geneva, and the international situation further eased. Although the summit meeting of the heads of government of the four powers was not directly produced by the Bandung Conference, the impact of the Bandung Conference on the international situation cannot be erased. As we commemorate the third anniversary of the Bandung Conference, we deeply feel that the world's demand for peaceful coexistence has become more extensive, deeper, and more urgent. However, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are doing everything possible to find various excuses to delay the convening of the summit meeting. But the facts show that when the world urgently demands easing tensions and peaceful coexistence, no matter how much procrastination and obstruction there is, it is futile.
    Another theme of the Bandung Conference was to promote friendly cooperation among Asian and African countries. The conference also adopted important resolutions on economic cooperation and cultural cooperation. These resolutions are being gradually implemented among Asian and African countries. Taking our country as an example, in the past three years, we have established relations with many Asian and African countries, started exchanges, conducted extensive cultural exchanges with many Asian and African countries, expanded trade, and provided friendly and unconditional economic and technical assistance to some countries. In general, the economic and cultural relations between Asian and African countries are becoming increasingly close, especially the development of mutual economic relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, which plays a significant and positive role in the economic stability and economic construction of the countries concerned. Recently, the Ceylonese government suggested to the Colombo Conference countries that an Asian-African Economic Conference be convened to further promote economic cooperation between Asian and African countries. Undoubtedly, such a conference will make a beneficial contribution to the economic development of Asian and African countries. In order to achieve economic independence, it is very necessary for Asian and African countries to strengthen cooperation. Imperialist countries have never been willing to give up the exploitation and enslavement of economically backward countries, and are absolutely unwilling to truly help economically backward countries industrialize. Currently, the capitalist world is facing the threat of an economic crisis, which has already caused difficulties for many Asian and African countries in terms of export trade, foreign exchange reserves, and construction funds. How to find a way out on the basis of unity, mutual assistance, and self-reliance is an important issue facing Asian and African countries today, urgently awaiting a solution, and the Bandung Conference three years ago, in its resolution on economic cooperation, has already prepared the correct foundation for its solution.
    Although the Bandung Conference was a conference attended only by Asian and African countries, its significance and impact are by no means limited to Asia and Africa. The main content and spirit of the Bandung Conference are to oppose colonialism, strive for and safeguard national independence, maintain world peace, implement peaceful coexistence, and promote friendly cooperation among all countries. These are also the propositions unanimously supported by the people of the world. In the past three years, the Asian and African people have not been alone in their struggle to practice the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, because first of all, the Asian and African people have increasingly understood the necessity of unity and mutual assistance, and at the same time, the facts show that the vast majority of people in the world, even those far away from Asia and Africa, are still closely related and share the same fate with their Asian and African brothers. Therefore, the Bandung Conference is by no means the private property of the Asian and African people, but the common banner of the people of the world against colonialism and demanding peaceful coexistence.
    Chairman Mao Zedong said in his speech to Chinese students studying in the Soviet Union on November 17, 1957, that the world now has a total population of 2.7 billion, the population of socialist countries is nearly 1 billion, the population of independent former colonial countries is more than 700 million, and the population of countries striving for independence or striving for complete independence is 600 million. The population of imperialism is only about 400 million, and they are internally divided. It is not the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind now, but the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind. This is the new international situation three years after the Bandung Conference. This new situation gives us complete confidence in the bright future of Asia, Africa, and the world. The records of the heroic struggles and brilliant achievements of Asian and African countries and people in the past three years further encourage us to continue to work tirelessly with the Asian and African brothers and the people of the world for peace, justice, and progress.

    万隆精神是全世界人民的旗帜

    今天，距离1955年4月的万隆会议已经三年了。这三年里，亚非人民为独立、和平和友好而进行的英勇斗争，以及他们所取得的辉煌的成就，充分表明“万隆精神”已经成为鼓舞全世界亿万人民反对殖民主义、反对侵略、实行和平共处的伟大号召。历史的进展日益显著地标志出万隆会议的时代意义。
    万隆会议突出地、集中地表达了亚非人民反对殖民主义、争取和保障民族独立的共同愿望和坚定决心。会议发出了亚非人民的共同呼声，宣布殖民主义是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害，谴责外国的征服、统治和剥削，并且支持所有被压迫国家人民的自由和独立的事业。在争取民族独立方面，自从万隆会议以来，马来亚、苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯和加纳已经取得了独立，阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚、阿曼、喀麦隆、乌干达、索马里兰、多哥、桑给巴尔等附属国和地区的反殖民主义斗争正在广泛展开、日益高涨。在所有这些斗争中，亚非各国人民不但为了各自的独立而英勇战斗、坚强不息，而且相互给予热烈的支持。这种伟大的友谊正是“万隆精神”的生动体现。
    三年来的经验还进一步证明，不仅被压迫民族的独立需要通过百折不挠的英勇斗争从殖民主义者手中夺取过来，就是已经取得的独立，也还需要百倍的警惕，并且在必要的时候还要进行坚决的斗争来维护它，因为殖民主义者绝对不会甘心承认失败，总是千方百计地企图卷土重来。在这三年里，埃及人民胜利地击退了英、法、以的武装进攻，叙利亚人民英勇地粉碎了美国所一手布置的军事威胁和进攻阴谋。现在，印度尼西亚人民正在为维护国家主权和反对美国干涉进行着重大的斗争。亚非人民的这些英勇坚决的斗争，艾森豪威尔主义在短短一年的时间里就已经臭不可闻、难以兜售，以及亚非两洲其它国家和地区的反殖民主义民族独立运动的蓬勃高涨，雄辩地说明了由万隆会议吹响了的亚非人民的共同的觉醒号角，大大地提高了亚非人民的觉悟，鼓舞了他们的战斗精神。今天每一个亚非人民都充满信心地看到殖民主义已经到了日暮穷途，亚非人民不能容忍殖民主义的枷锁继续套在他们身上。
    万隆会议以来，亚非人民从实际生活中更加体会到团结互助的意义。去年年底和今年年初在开罗举行的亚非人民团结大会，最近在加纳首都阿克拉举行的非洲独立国家会议，表明了亚非国家和人民的日益鲜明而坚决的反殖民主义立场，表明了他们正在向更加紧密和更加广泛的团结的道路上迈进。这两个会议还表现了非洲国家和人民开始以主人翁的身份走上国际政治舞台，这是一件十分值得欣喜的事。
    保障世界和平是亚非人民的共同的热烈愿望。万隆会议所通过的“关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言”是对于世界和平事业的一个巨大的贡献。由亚洲的中国、印度、缅甸所倡议的和平共处五项原则，通过万隆会议，发展成为和平共处十项原则，使和平共处原则得到更广泛的国际承认。事实上，和平共处并不仅仅是亚非人民的愿望，而且是全世界广大人民的迫切要求。和平共处的原则在这几年来，已经得到越来越广泛的承认。在这方面，万隆会议起了重要的作用。1957年12月14日，联合国大会也通过了和平共处的决议。正是由于万隆会议真正表达了广大的亚非人民乃至全世界人民要求和平共处的愿望，“万隆精神”实际上也就是当前的时代精神和全世界人民的呼声。
    人们都还记得，万隆会议以后不久在日内瓦举行了四国政府首脑会议，国际局势进一步走向和缓。虽然四国政府首脑会议不是由万隆会议直接产生，但是万隆会议所造成的对国际局势的影响是不能抹煞的。我们在纪念万隆会议三周年的时候，深深地感觉到全世界对于和平共处的要求已经更加广泛、更加深入、更加迫切。但是，美、英、法等国政府都在千方百计找寻种种借口拖延最高级会议的召开。但事实表明，当全世界迫切要求和缓紧张局势、和平共处的时候，不管怎样拖延阻挠，都是徒劳的。
    万隆会议的另一个主题是促进亚非各国间的友好合作。会议还通过了关于经济合作和文化合作的重要决议。这些决议在亚非国家之间正在逐步实现。仅以我国来说，三年来同不少亚非国家建立了关系，开始了往来，同许多亚非国家进行了广泛的文化交流，扩大了贸易，并且还对有些国家提供了友好的、不附条件的经济、技术援助。总的说来，亚非国家之间的经济文化关系日趋密切，尤其是在平等互利基础上的相互经济关系的发展，对于有关各国的经济稳定、经济建设等等都起着重大的、积极的作用。最近，锡兰政府向哥伦坡会议国家建议召开亚非经济会议以进一步促进亚非国家的经济合作。无疑地，这种会议对于亚非国家的经济发展将会作出有益的贡献。亚非国家为了实现经济上的独立，加强合作是十分必要的。帝国主义国家从来就不曾愿意放弃对经济落后国家的剥削和奴役，也绝不愿意真正帮助经济落后国家工业化，而目前资本主义世界正面临着经济危机的威胁，已经引起了许多亚非国家在出口贸易，外汇储备、建设资金等方面的困难。如何从团结互助、自力更生的基础上找寻出路，正是今天亚非国家所面临的一个重要课题，迫切地等待解决，而三年前的万隆会议，在关于经济合作的决议中，已经为它的解决途径准备了正确的基础。
    虽然万隆会议是只有亚非国家参加的会议，但是，就它的意义和影响来说，绝不是仅限于亚非两洲的。万隆会议的主要内容和精神是反对殖民主义、争取和保障民族独立，维护世界和平、实行和平共处，促进各国友好合作。这些，也正是全世界人民所一致拥护的主张。三年来，亚非人民在实践万隆会议决议的奋斗中是丝毫也不孤单的，因为首先亚非人民已经日益懂得团结互助的必要，同时事实表明全世界的广大人民，尽管远在亚洲和非洲以外，他们同亚非的弟兄们仍然是利害相关、呼吸与共的。因此，万隆会议决不是亚非人民所私有的，而是全世界人民反对殖民主义、要求和平共处的共同旗帜。
    毛泽东主席1957年11月17日在对我国留苏学生的讲话中说，现在全世界共有二十七亿人口，社会主义各国的人口将近十亿，独立了的旧殖民地国家的人口有七亿多，正在争取独立或者争取完全独立的国家人口有六亿，帝国主义人口不过四亿左右，而且他们的内部是分裂的。现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风。这就是万隆会议三年以后的国际新形势。这种新的形势使我们对于亚非两洲和全世界的光明前景具有完全的信心。三年来亚非国家和人民的英勇斗争和光辉成就的纪录更加鼓舞着我们同亚非兄弟人民和全世界人民一道为和平、正义和进步而继续不懈的努力。
