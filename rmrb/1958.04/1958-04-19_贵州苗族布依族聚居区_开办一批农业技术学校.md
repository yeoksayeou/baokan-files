Xinhua News Agency report: In early April, Taijiang County, a mountainous area inhabited by the Miao people, and Wangmo County, inhabited by the Buyi people, in Guizhou Province, established sixteen technical schools for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sericulture. These schools have a total of more than 1,460 students. The school buildings, equipment, and expenses are all raised by the masses themselves, without spending a penny of state funds. Only the teachers are drawn by the leading organs from on-the-job cadres, primary school teachers, cadres sent to lower levels, and agricultural technology extension stations. These schools all adopt a half-work, half-study method, with a study period generally lasting one and a half to three years. The technical knowledge learned in each school is closely linked to the specific conditions of the local area.
The CCP committees at all levels in Taijiang and Wangmo counties attach great importance to these schools. The secretaries and deputy secretaries of the district committees in Wangmo County have respectively taken on the positions of principals and vice-principals of the schools run in their respective districts.

    贵州苗族布依族聚居区
    开办一批农业技术学校
    据新华社讯　贵州省山区苗族人民聚居的台江县和布依族人民聚居的望谟县，在4月上旬开办了十六所农业、林业、畜牧业和蚕桑等技术学校。这些学校的学生共有一千四百六十多人。这些学校的房屋、用具和经费开支等，都由群众自筹解决，不用国家一文钱。只是学校的教员，是领导机关从在职干部、小学教师、下放干部和农业技术推广站中抽调的。这些学校都采取半耕半读的方法，学习时间一般是一年半到三年。各校学习的有关技术知识，都密切联系当地的具体情况。
    台江和望谟两县的中共各级党委，对这些学校都十分重视。望谟县各区区委的正副书记都分别兼任了本区所办学校的正副校长职务。
