    The play "February 7th Storm," recently performed by the China Railway Acrobatic Troupe, is an epic that sings the praises of the heroic struggle of Chinese railway workers in 1923. This is Lin Xiangqian bringing the good news of the victory of the Changxindian railway workers' strike (the fourth from the left is Lin Xiangqian).
