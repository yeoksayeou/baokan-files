    Lü Xisan, Head of the Mat Factory
    Speaking of the mat factory that developed from eleven yuan of capital to an annual output value of 110,000 yuan, people will think of its head, Lü Xisan. In the beginning, the factory didn't even have a place to produce, so they started production in front of the military dependent Aunt Cui's house. When it was overcast or raining, they moved into a dilapidated temple. The two single rooms of the dilapidated temple couldn't keep out the wind and rain, so they moved into the guild hall. At that time, Lü Xisan led everyone to clean the site, repair the broken houses, and bury the remains that had been unattended for many years. During the day, he went around buying raw materials and selling products. At night, he slept in the open air next to the graves, looking after the factory's raw materials. For almost every night of the autumn, his quilt was covered with white frost. But he didn't feel any hardship at all, and he always led the production in such a tense and happy manner. Later, they found a dilapidated thatched house with a broken beam supported by bamboo poles. Others dared not live in it, but Lü Xisan didn't care. He said, "If the house collapses, just use your head to hold it up, what's there to be afraid of?"
    Lü Xisan also cared deeply for the workers in the factory. When winter came, he saw that some people still had difficulties in their lives, so he took the initiative to propose using part of the welfare fund to make cotton clothes and quilts for them. Recently, he also managed to build some factory buildings, so that some blind people working in the open air would no longer suffer from the wind and sun.

    席薄厂负责人吕习三
    提起从十一元资金发展到年产值十一万元的席薄厂，人们就会想到它的负责人吕习三来。开始的时候，这个厂连个生产的地方也没有，先是在军属崔大娘家的门口生产。碰到阴天下雨，他们就搬进破庙。破庙的两间单房挡不住风雨，他们又搬进了会馆。当时吕习三带领大家清理场地，修补破屋，掩埋多年无人过问的尸骨之后，他白天到处奔走购买原料推销产品，晚上，就睡在坟堆旁边露天底下，照看厂里的原料，一个秋天，几乎夜夜在他的被窝上落满了白霜。但他丝毫不觉得有什么苦，总是那样紧张愉快地领导着生产。后来，他们找到了一间断了大梁、用竹竿撑着的烂草屋，别人不敢住进去，吕习三却不在乎，他说：“屋塌了，头一顶就过去了，怕什么。”
    吕习三对厂里的工人也关怀备至。冬天到了，他看见一些人生活上还有困难，就主动提出一部分福利金，为他们添制棉衣和棉被。最近，他又设法盖起了一部分厂房，使一些在露天生产的盲人不再受风吹日晒之苦。
