Shehong County's Experimental Square Nursery Method a Success
Corn Yields Possible Three Times a Year

(Our dispatch) Shehong County, Sichuan Province, has successfully experimented with a new corn planting method – the "Corn Square Nursery Transplanting Method." This method not only increases corn yield, but also greatly shortens the time it occupies the land, providing a great possibility for growing three crops of corn a year.

In the past, this county planted corn at most only twice a season, namely early corn and late corn, which both have a maturity period of about seventy days. If 'Golden Queen' corn was planted, because the maturity period is about one hundred and twenty days, then only one crop could be planted. The farm's experiments over the past two years have proven that early corn grown by nursery transplanting can mature in thirty-five to forty days after transplanting. Because the transplanting method solves the contradiction that spring crops cannot vacate the land, the corn sowing period can be greatly advanced. In this way, if 'Golden Queen' corn is planted in the second season after early corn using the nursery transplanting method, and autumn corn is planted in the third season using the nursery transplanting and intercropping methods, the time occupied by the three seasons in the main field will not exceed one hundred and eighty-five days, making it very possible to achieve three crops of corn a year.

The farm believes that the reason for the increased corn yield with nursery transplanting is: centralized management of seedlings is easier; fertile seedbeds promote better seedling growth; and the advanced maturity period after transplanting avoids the drought or cloudy and rainy weather that easily occurs locally during the corn tasseling period.

The "Corn Square Nursery Method" involves making a three-inch-thick seedbed "nutrient embryo" from fertile mud, dividing it into three-inch square grids. When sowing, a five-fen-deep hole is made in the center of each grid, and three to four seeds are sown in each grid, covered with fine soil. After the seedlings emerge, one or two well-growing seedlings are left in each grid for transplanting. To avoid the intermingling of young roots, the grid should be sun-dried for a few days after being drawn to allow slight cracks between the grids.

The Shehong Farm is further conducting experiments on three seasons of corn a year. They have already sown the seeds of the first season of early corn at the vernal equinox.

### 射洪县试验方格育苗法成功  玉米一年可能三熟

    射洪县试验方格育苗法成功
    玉米一年可能三熟
    本报讯　四川省射洪县农场试验成功了一种新的玉米种植方法——“玉米方格育苗移栽法”。这种方法不但使玉米产量提高，而且由于缩短了占用土地时间，为一年种三季玉米提供了很大的可能性。
    过去，这个县种植玉米最多只达到两季，即成熟期都是七十天左右的早玉米和晚玉米，如果种金皇后，因为成熟期要一百二十天左右，则只能种一季。两年来农场的试验证明：用育苗移栽种的早玉米，移栽后三十五到四十天就可以成熟。由于移栽方法解决了小春作物不能腾出土地的矛盾，玉米播种期可以大大提前。这样，如果在早玉米后第二季用育苗移栽法种金皇后玉米，第三季用育苗移栽法和套种方式种秋玉米，三季占用本田时间不会超过一百八十五天，实现玉米一年三熟十分可能。
    育苗移栽玉米产量提高的原因，农场认为是由于：幼苗集中便于管理；苗床肥沃促使苗稼生长得好；移栽后成熟期提前躲过了当地在玉米扬花时期容易出现的干旱或阴雨。
    “玉米方格育苗法”是用肥泥做成三寸厚的苗床“营养胚”，划成三寸见方的方格，下种时在方格正中掏五分深的洞，每格下种三到四粒，用细土覆盖。出苗后，每格留生长好的苗稼一到二株移栽。为了避免幼根互窜，划好方格后应晒几天，使方格间微微裂开。
    射洪农场正进一步进行一年三季玉米的试验，他们在春分时就已播下了第一季早玉米的种子。
