Introduction to Several Major Oil Crops
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute, Sun Darong

China has a vast territory, spanning the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones, and can produce a large number of vegetable oils. Moreover, most vegetable oils are edible.

Most plant seeds contain oil. However, the oil crops with high oil content, excellent oil quality, and utilization value are mainly: rapeseed, peanuts, sesame, sunflower, castor bean, and flax.

Rapeseed
Rapeseed, also known as canola, is one of China's most important oil crops. The rapeseed planting area is about 30 million mu, and the annual output ranks first in the world (accounting for more than half of the world's total output).

Rapeseed is mainly distributed in the provinces of the Yangtze River Basin. Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei are all major rapeseed producing areas. This area mostly uses the winter fallow fields after rice harvest to cultivate rapeseed, and the selected varieties are mainly *Brassica napus* high-oil rapeseed, dwarf rapeseed, and northern rapeseed.

In high-altitude cold mountainous areas—Yunnan, Tibet, and the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai in northern China—there is also spring rapeseed cultivation. Some of those places grow radish seeds or mustard seeds.

There are many varieties of rapeseed cultivated in China, and each region has local varieties suitable for local natural conditions. In recent years, due to the outstanding characteristics of "Victory Rapeseed" in high yield, high oil yield, resistance to downy mildew and virus diseases, Sichuan Province has promoted more than 2 million mu, and the provinces in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have also successfully trialed it.

Fertilization technology is a key measure for increasing rapeseed production. In addition to base fertilizer, topdressing rapeseed has a great yield-increasing effect. However, the timing of topdressing should be determined according to the growth and development process of rapeseed. According to mass experience, topdressing can be divided into three times, namely "seedling fertilizer, winter fertilizer, and flower fertilizer," among which flower fertilizer is the most important.

Peanut
Although peanuts have only been cultivated in China for three or four hundred years, the planting area is very wide because the climate and soil are suitable for its growth and development. China currently has a peanut planting area of about 40 million mu, second only to India. Half of them are distributed in the Yellow River and Huai River basins in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and northern Jiangsu. Shandong Province alone accounts for about 25% of the total national planting area, and the average yield is also higher. Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Sichuan provinces also have many peanuts. In addition to some spring-sown large peanuts, there is a large proportion of summer and autumn-sown small peanuts.

In order to obtain high and stable yields of peanuts, the following measures should be implemented: selecting full and large seeds with a germination rate of more than 90%, appropriate close planting, and promoting rhizobium inoculation. Apply sufficient base fertilizer and apply topdressing as appropriate.

Continuous cropping of peanuts on sandy soil will affect the increase of peanut production. If the peanut land is deeply ploughed, compacted with soil, compacted with mud, the soil is improved, and more fertilizer is applied, production can be increased.

Peanuts have a certain adaptability to acidic soils, so peanuts have become a pioneer crop for developing red soil. However, peanuts need more calcium during their growth and development; when calcium is lacking, peanuts will experience empty pods and kernels. Research results have proved that pearl-bean-type small peanuts have lower requirements for calcium and are suitable for cultivation on calcium-deficient soils. The Jiangxi Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences discovered that "Bandit Peanut" is a variety particularly suitable for red soil cultivation.

The production potential of peanuts is extremely high. Each peanut plant can bloom two to four hundred flowers, and individual excellent ones can even reach one thousand flowers. Unfortunately, these flowers cannot all bear fruit. Under normal cultivation conditions, each plant only bears ten to twenty pods, about 15% of the number of flowers. Therefore, if cultivation conditions can be well used to promote peanut fruiting, the effect of increasing production will be immeasurable. In 1957, Hong'an County, Hubei Province, under the influence of summer and autumn drought, the average peanut yield of the county was still as high as more than 600 jin per mu, which is equivalent to three times the national average yield, which well illustrates this problem.

In the future, the cultivation of peanuts should be greatly developed in the red soil in central and southern China, the sandy land in northwestern Liaoning, the gaps in windbreak forest belts, and the large areas of sandy wasteland left after the rectification of river channels in a planned manner.

Sesame
China is the world's major sesame producing country. Sesame is cultivated in all provinces from south to north in China, but the main producing areas are concentrated in Suiping and Runan in southern Henan Province and Xiangyang in northern Hubei Province, accounting for about 50% of the national planting area. This area is mainly summer sesame, a post-crop after wheat and other crops in a two-crop-a-year system. North of the Yellow River, spring sesame is more common, with Hebei Province having the largest planting area. South of the Yangtze River, there are also autumn sesame plantings in Guangdong, Guangxi, and the southwest, with Jiangxi Province having the most.

The average sesame yield per mu is only fifty to sixty jin. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, various places have created many cases of high and abundant yields. For example, in 1955, the sesame yield per mu in Huanggang Farm, Hubei Province, was 373 jin and 11 liang; in 1956, the average sesame yield per mu in Damiao Agricultural Cooperative, Sixian County, Anhui Province, reached 360 jin. This fully proves that the potential for increasing the yield per unit area of sesame is very great.

To obtain a higher yield of sesame, appropriate organic fertilizer needs to be applied. However, too much fertilizer can easily cause the plants to turn green, delaying the maturity period.

Sesame is an indeterminate inflorescence, flowering upwards from the base of the stem. Due to the influence of the growth period, the flowers that bloom later at the tip of the stem are of little significance in production. Therefore, after the flowers appear at the tip of the stem, removing two to three inches of the top can promote the concentration of nutrient supply and increase yield.

Sunflower
In the past, China did not have the habit of eating sunflower seed oil. Most countries in the Soviet Union and Europe use sunflower seed oil as the main edible vegetable oil.

In addition to large-scale cultivation of sunflowers in northern Heilongjiang, Hebei, and Shanxi, they are sporadically planted in provinces from south to north in China for snack consumption. Because the production purpose is for snack consumption, most of the edible varieties are cultivated in China. Its characteristics are: thick skin, small kernel, and less oil. In recent years, China has introduced many excellent oil-use varieties from the Soviet Union, such as "Soviet No. 3" and "Prairie People." The general characteristics of these varieties are: early maturity, short plant, large flower plate, small seeds, thin skin, large kernel, and high oil content. It has now been determined to promote "Soviet No. 3" in Heilongjiang Province and "Prairie People" and other varieties on the saline-alkali land of Bohai Bay.

Sunflower seed oil is of high quality and has no odor. If the existing sunflowers are replaced with oil-use varieties, it will have a great effect on increasing oil production. According to oil analysis, every 100 jin of sunflower kernels can produce at least three to five jin more oil.

Castor Bean
Castor bean also has a wide range of adaptability. From Northeast China to Guangdong, castor beans are everywhere, and Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Shandong have the most. Except for a small part of large-scale cultivation in Inner Mongolia, various places use the sides of houses and the corners of the land for sporadic planting.

The average oil content of castor bean seeds is about 45%, and after shelling, the oil content can be as high as more than 80%. Castor oil has a wide range of uses. Refined castor oil can be used for medicine and is also a good lubricating oil for airplanes; some areas also eat it.

Because castor bean is easy to cultivate and easy to survive, it is particularly suitable for sporadic planting.

Flax
Flax is oilseed flax, mainly distributed in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hebei, and the northern regions of Shanxi Province.

Flax oil is a drying oil. Cold-pressed oil can be eaten; hot-pressed products have an odor and cannot be eaten. In addition to seeds that can be squeezed for oil, its stems can also be used to make fiber for textiles.

There are many kinds of oil crops in China. The above are just the main oil sources in the current large-scale production and cultivation. Oil crops not only have a pivotal position in the needs of people's lives and the supply of raw materials for light industry, but also are very important materials in foreign trade. In order to better ensure the great leap forward in agricultural production, how to rapidly and effectively increase the production of oil crops on the basis of increased grain and cotton production is an important issue at present.

    几种主要油料作物的介绍
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所　孙大容
    我国幅员广阔，地跨寒、温、热三带，能大量生产植物油的植物很多，而且绝大部分植物油都可以食用。
    绝大多数的植物种子中都含有油份。但油量较多、油质优良、有利用价值的油料作物，主要是：油菜、花生、芝麻、向日葵、蓖麻和葫麻等。
    油菜
    油菜也叫菜籽，是我国最重要的油料作物之一。油菜种植面积约有三千多万亩，年产量占全世界的第一位（约为世界总产量的一半以上）。
    油菜主要分布于长江流域各省，四川、湖南和湖北都是盛产油菜的地方。这个地区大部分是利用水稻收获后的冬闲田来栽培油菜，选种的主要是芸苔属的高油菜、矮油菜和北方油菜。
    在高寒山区——云南、西藏和我国北部的甘肃、青海等省，还有栽培春油菜的。那些地方种的有些是萝卜子或芥菜子。
    我国栽培的油菜品种很多，各地区都有适于当地自然条件的地方品种。最近几年来，由于“胜利油菜”突出地表现了产量高、出油率高、抗霜霉病和毒素病等特点，四川省已推广了二百余万亩，长江中游各省也已试种成功。
    施肥技术是油菜增产的关键性措施。除了基肥以外，给油菜追肥有极大的增产作用。但是追肥的时间，要根据油菜生长和发育过程来决定。根据群众经验，可以分三次追肥，即“苗肥、腊肥和花肥”，其中尤以花肥为最重要。
    落花生
    落花生在我国栽培虽然只有三、四百年历史，但是由于气候和土壤都适于它的生长和发育，因而栽培面积很广。我国现有花生栽培面积四千万亩左右，仅次于印度。其中半数分布于黄淮流域的山东、河南、河北以及苏北一带。而山东省的栽培面积即达全国总面积的25％左右，平均产量也较高。广东、广西、福建和四川等省也有很多花生，除了一部分春种大花生以外，有很大比重的夏秋播种的小花生。
    为了要获得花生的高额而稳定的产量，应该贯彻下列几项措施：选用饱满大粒具有90％以上发芽力的种子，适当密植，推广根瘤菌拌种；施用充足的底肥并酌施追肥。
    在沙土上连年连作花生，这样就会影响花生产量的提高。如果对花生地进行深翻、压土、压泥、改良土壤，多施肥料，就可以增产。
    花生对于酸性土壤有一定的适应能力，因而花生成为开发红壤的先锋作物。但是在花生的生长和发育过程中需要较多的钙质；缺少钙质时，花生会发生空荚不仁的现象。根据研究结果证明，珍珠豆型小花生对于钙质的要求较低，适于在缺钙的土壤上栽培。江西省农业科学研究所发现“强盗花生”是特别适于红壤栽培的品种。
    花生的生产潜力极高。每株花生可以开花二百至四百朵，个别优良的甚至可以达到一千朵。可惜的是这些花不能完全结实，在一般栽培条件下，每株不过着生十至二十个荚果，约为开花数的15％左右。因此如果能很好的运用栽培条件来促进花生结实，增产的效果将不可限量。湖北省红安县1957年在夏秋干旱的影响下，全县花生仍然平均亩产六百多斤的高额产量，相当于全国平均产量的三倍，就很好的说明了这个问题。
    今后应该有计划地在华中和华南一带的红壤上、辽宁西北部的风沙地上、防沙林带的间隙中和改治河道后所遗留的大片沙荒上，大量发展花生的栽培。
    芝麻
    我国是世界上主要生产芝麻的国家。我国从南到北各省都有芝麻的栽培，但主要产区集中于河南省南部的遂平、汝南和湖北省北部襄阳一带，约为全国栽培面积的50％。这个地区主要是夏芝麻，为大麦、小麦等作物一年两熟制的后作。黄河以北地区多为春芝麻，以河北省种植面积最多。长江以南，广东、广西以及西南等地亦有种秋芝麻的，以江西省为最多。
    芝麻的亩产量平均不过五十到六十斤。解放后在党和政府的领导下，各地曾创造了很多高额丰产的事例。例如1955年湖北黄岗农场每亩芝麻产量三百七十三斤十一两；1956年安徽宿县大庙农业社平均每亩达到三百六十斤。这充分地证明了提高芝麻单位面积产量的潜力很大。
    要想获得较高产量的芝麻需要施以适当的有机质肥料。但是，肥料太多，也容易使植株发生返青现象，延迟成熟期。
    芝麻为无限花序，从茎的基部开始向上开花。由于生育期的影响，梢端后开的花在生产上的意义不大，所以当梢端现花后打去二—三寸的顶梢，可以促进养分集中供应，增加产量。
    向日葵
    我国过去没有食用葵籽油的习惯。苏联和欧洲的一些国家大多以葵籽油为主要的食用植物油。
    向日葵除了在黑龙江、河北和山西的北部有较大面积的栽培以外，从南到北各省都是零星种植，供作零食用。由于生产目的是为了零食消费，所以我国大都栽培食用种。它的特点是：皮厚、仁小、油少。近年来我国由苏联引进很多优良的油用品种，——“苏联三号”“草原人”等，这些品种一般特点是：早熟、植株低矮、花盘大、种子小、皮薄、仁大、油多。现在已经确定在黑龙江省推广“苏联三号”，在渤海湾盐碱地上推广“草原人”等品种。
    葵籽油的质量很高，无臭味。如将现有向日葵换种油用品种，对于提高产油量有极大的作用。根据油份分析，每百斤葵仁最少可多出三至五斤油。
    蓖麻
    蓖麻的适应性也很广。从东北到广东，处处都有蓖麻，而尤以吉林、内蒙古、河北、山东为最多。除了内蒙古有一部分大量栽培的以外，各地都是利用屋旁，地角零星种植。
    蓖麻种子的含油量平均约45％左右，脱壳以后含油量可高达80％以上。蓖麻油的用处很广，精炼过的蓖麻油可作医药用，也是飞机用的良好润滑油；有的地区也食用。
    因为蓖麻很容易栽培，也很容易成活，所以特别适于零星种植。
    葫麻
    葫麻就是油用亚麻，主要分布于内蒙古自治区、河北和山西省的北部地区。
    葫麻油是干性油。冷榨所得到的油可以食用；热榨产品有臭味，不能食用。葫麻除了种子可以榨油以外，它的茎秆还可以制纤维供纺织用。
    我国油料作物的种类很多，上述几种不过是目前大面积生产栽培中的主要油源。油料不但在人民生活的需要和轻工业原料的供应上有举足轻重的地位，而且是对外贸易中很重要的物资。为了更好的保证农业生产大跃进，在粮食棉花增产的基础上，如何迅速而有效地提高油料的生产是当前的重要问题。
