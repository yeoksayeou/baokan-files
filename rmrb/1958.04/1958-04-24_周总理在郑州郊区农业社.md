    Premier Zhou at an Agricultural Cooperative in the Suburbs of Zhengzhou
    Fang Huang, Lin Zhao
    On the afternoon of April 20th, Premier Zhou Enlai, along with Vice Premier Peng Dehuai, Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun, and others, arrived at the Guanhutun Agricultural Cooperative in Yanzhuang Township, Zhengzhou suburban district.

    A little after three o'clock, Premier Zhou's car drove into the village. Cooperative cadres and district and township officials who had been waiting eagerly went forward to shake hands with Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Peng, and others. At this moment, an old man with white hair emerged from the crowd. People vied to introduce him to Premier Zhou: he was the labor model Bao Youde. Premier Zhou grasped his hand tightly and asked with concern, "How old are you? Is your health good?" Bao Youde said, "Seventy years old, and my health is very good. I can still earn eight work points a day and carry a hundred catties!" The Premier was very pleased and turned to introduce him to Vice Premier Peng and Comrade Xi Zhongxun. Then, the Premier asked a woman walking beside him what her job was. When the Premier learned that she was the deputy secretary of the cooperative's Communist Youth League branch, he smiled and said, "How many work points do you earn?"
      "Seven points," Fan Rongxian replied.
      "Good, the elderly and women here can all work. Truly, the elderly surpass Huang Zhong, and the women surpass Mu Guiying."

    Looking at the Wheat, Discussing the Harvest
    Next to a wheat field, Premier Zhou inquired in detail about wheat production: how many plants per mu, how many seeds per ear, and he squatted down to observe the soil moisture and wheat growth. When people told the Premier that the planned yield was 700 jin per mu, the Premier said, "Wow, that's a lot! Can it be achieved?" He asked Comrade Du Dexin who was beside him. "Yes!" Comrade Du Dexin replied. At this time, the old man Bao Youde came out from the crowd. Premier Zhou asked him, "What they say doesn't count. You have experience. How much do you think you can harvest this year?" Bao Youde said, "Seven hundred jin. I have lived for seventy years and have never seen such good wheat. Seven hundred jin can be done!" Premier Zhou happily said: "If the old man says it can be done, then it can be done."

    People told Premier Zhou that this was not the best wheat in the cooperative; the best wheat would yield 1,000 jin per mu. Premier Zhou came to the wheat field planned to produce 1,000 jin per mu. The dark green wheat was packed tightly together. Premier Zhou repeatedly praised it as good wheat. Cooperative Chairman Liu Shouchong told Premier Zhou that there were more than 400 mu of such first-class wheat in the entire cooperative; among the more than 2,000 mu of wheat in the entire cooperative, only 50 mu were third-class wheat. At this time, Du Dexin, deputy secretary of the suburban agricultural committee, plucked an ear of wheat and counted 37 grains. Premier Zhou took the ear of wheat and said, "Thirty-seven grains, that's not bad! I want to keep this ear of wheat." Liu Shouchong continued: "In such high-yield land, on average, each ear of wheat has 40 grains." Premier Zhou asked: "How many plants per mu?" Liu Shouchong said: "1.2 million plants." Premier Zhou said: "Added up, it's almost 1,000 jin." He happily said to the cooperative members: "If you harvest this much, we will write you a letter of congratulations!" There was another burst of laughter. The cooperative members were deeply moved by Premier Zhou's deep concern for production. At this time, Vice Premier Peng took Bao Youde's hand and said: "Tell me, how much good wheat could you harvest before liberation?" Bao Youde said: "Less than 200 jin. My four or five mu of land was considered good, yielding only 120 or 130 jin." Vice Premier Peng said excitedly: "One mu now is equivalent to five mu back then!"

          Chatting with the Masses
    The news of Premier Zhou's arrival spread quickly, and more and more cooperative members came to see Premier Zhou. Premier Zhou shook the hand of an old man named Xu Zhankui and talked with him cordially, asking him how old he was, how many people were in his family, and how many work points he could do. Xu Zhankui told Premier Zhou that there were six people in his family and that he could do eight work points a day. Premier Zhou praised him for being old but working well.

    Returning from the wheat field, the neighbors of the agricultural production cooperative, the students of the Industrial Planning Economics School, applauded together to welcome Premier Zhou's arrival. Premier Zhou waved to them and educated them to learn from the agricultural cooperative. The Premier said: "The land where you live is the cooperative's land, so participate more in voluntary labor." The Premier asked, "Who is the Party committee secretary?... When the agricultural cooperative is too busy, you should mobilize." He also pointed to a wheat field and said to the students, "The economics you are learning is right here." The students replied in unison: "We remember, we will study hard."

    Premier Zhou was very concerned about the cooperative's and the members' income. He kept asking about the cooperative's harvest last year. The cooperative chairman told the Premier that the total income of the cooperative last year was 160,000 yuan, and the planned income this year was 560,000 yuan. Premier Zhou said: "This is truly a great harvest, a great leap forward." Then Premier Zhou also visited the cooperative's sweet potato hotbed seedling cultivation.

    This year, the cooperative will plant 800 mu of sweet potatoes, all using the hotbed seedling cultivation method. Hotbed seedling cultivation can advance planting, increase yield, and prevent sweet potato black spot disease. The entire cooperative will promote the hotbed seedling cultivation method on all 800 mu, ensuring a yield of 10,000 jin per mu this year, striving for 12,500 jin.

    After visiting the hotbed seedling cultivation method, Premier Zhou visited the home of Zhang Yunbao, the captain of the cooperative's Third Production Team. Zhang Yunbao was a poor peasant before liberation, and his family was very poor. After liberation, his life improved year by year, and he built three new houses last year. Premier Zhou walked into his room and looked at the clean and tidy furnishings. He asked Zhang Yunbao: "Do you have enough grain to eat?" Zhang Yunbao said: "Yes, more than enough."

    Encouraging Cadres Sent to Lower Levels to Train Well
    A little after four o'clock in the afternoon, Premier Zhou arrived at the Changzhai Agricultural Cooperative in Yanzhuang Township. A meeting of cadres sent to lower levels was being held here. People immediately surrounded Premier Zhou. When Premier Zhou learned that they were cadres sent to lower levels, he asked with concern, "How long have you been here? Are you used to the life?" Premier Zhou patted a cadre's shoulder and said, "Does your shoulder still hurt?" He turned around and asked a woman walking beside him humorously: "Have you cried?" People answered in unison: "No!" Along with the firm answer, there was a burst of hearty laughter. At this time, people felt as if a warm current was flowing through their bodies. The Premier cared so much about the cadres sent to lower levels, and he was so approachable. The Premier encouraged the cadres sent to lower levels to work hard, train well, transform their thinking, and learn humbly from the old farmers.

    As he walked, Premier Zhou inquired in detail about the cooperative's situation. From labor to production, to the cooperative's production increase plan this year, and the work situation of the cadres sent to lower levels, he was truly meticulous. When Premier Zhou was about to leave the Changzhai Agricultural Production Cooperative, he repeatedly asked: "How are the cadres sent to lower levels doing?" And he repeatedly exhorted the township and cooperative cadres here: "You must use them well, and they must also help you with some cultural learning."

    People did not have time to notice the time, but the sun was already setting. People reluctantly said goodbye to the beloved Premier Zhou.

    Premier Zhou has left, but people have not calmed down immediately. People felt that Premier Zhou had brought them strength and encouragement. The cadres of the Guanhutun Agricultural Cooperative decided to hold a mass meeting that night to discuss how to ensure the full realization of this year's production increase plan according to Premier Zhou's instructions. The cadres sent to lower levels in Changzhai Cooperative also expressed that they would "be red in the countryside, be specialized in the countryside," and contribute everything to the great leap forward in agricultural production. Their common wish is: to ensure the completion of the production leap forward plan, to send good news to the Party Central Committee, and to thank Premier Zhou for his concern.

    周总理在郑州郊区农业社
    方徨  林召
    4月20日下午，周恩来总理和彭德怀副总理、习仲勋秘书长等来到了郑州市郊区燕庄乡关虎屯农业社。
    三点多钟，周总理乘坐的汽车开进了村庄，早就等在这里的农业社干部和区、乡干部都拥上去和周总理、彭副总理等握手。这时，人群中走出了一个白发苍苍的老汉，人们争着向周总理介绍：他是劳动模范鲍有德。周总理紧紧地握着他的手，亲切地问：“多大年纪了？身体好不好？”鲍有德说：“七十岁，身体很好。一天还可以挣八个工分，挑一百斤呢！”总理非常高兴，转过脸来，把他介绍给彭副总理和习仲勋同志。接着，总理又询问走在旁边的一位女同志，问她是做什么工作的。当总理知道她是社里的团支部副书记时，笑着说：“你做多少工分？”
      “七分。”范荣仙答。
      “好呀，你们这里的老年人、妇女都能干，真是老年赛过老黄忠，妇女赛过穆桂英。”
    看小麦，谈收成
    在一块麦田旁边，周总理详细地询问了小麦生产情况：一亩地有多少株，一穗有多少籽，并且蹲下来察看墒情和小麦生长情况。当人们告诉总理每亩计划产量七百斤时，总理说：“嗬，这么多！能达到吗？”他问旁边的杜德新同志。“能！”杜德新同志回答。这时，鲍有德老汉从人群中走了出来。周总理问他说：“他们说了不算，你有经验，你说今年能收多少？”鲍有德说：“七百斤。我活了七十岁，没见过这样好的麦子。七百斤办到了！”周总理愉快地说：老汉说能行那就能行。
    人们告诉周总理，这还不是社里最好的麦子，最好的麦子每亩要打一千斤。周总理来到了计划亩产千斤的小麦田里，绿得发乌的麦子挤得紧紧密密，周总理连声称赞好麦子。社长刘守忠向周总理介绍说：像这样的一类麦田全社有四百多亩；全社二千多亩麦田中，三类麦只有五十亩。这时，郊区农委副书记杜德新拔下一根麦穗，数了数有三十七粒。周总理接过这个麦穗说：“有三十七粒，可不坏呀！我要把这个麦穗保存起来。”刘守忠接着说：像这样的丰产地，平均起来每根麦穗有四十粒。周总理问：每亩有多少株？刘守忠说：一百二十万株。周总理说：合起来就差不多是一千斤了。他高兴地向社员说：“你们要收这么多，我们要给你们写信庆贺啊！”又是一阵欢笑声。社员们都为周总理这种深切关怀生产的精神深深感动。这时候，彭副总理拉着鲍有德的手说：“你说说，解放前好麦能收多少？”鲍有德说：“不到二百斤。我的四、五亩地还算好的呢，才一百二、三十斤。”彭副总理兴奋地说：“现在一亩顶五亩！”
          和群众谈家常
    周总理来到的消息迅速地传开了，越来越多的社员都赶来看周总理。周总理握着一个叫徐占魁老汉的手，和他亲切地交谈，问他多大年纪，家里有多少人，能做多少工分？徐占魁告诉周总理说：家里有六个人，他自己一天能做八个工分。周总理称赞他人老劳动可不错。
    从麦田里回来，农业生产合作社的邻居、工业计划经济学校的学生，一齐鼓掌欢迎周总理来临。周总理向他们招手，并且教育他们要向农业社学习。总理说：你们住的地方就是社里的土地，要多参加义务劳动。总理问：“那位是党委书记？……农业社一忙不过来，你们就出动。”他还指着一块麦田向学生说：“你们学的经济学就在这里。”同学们一致回答说：“我们记住，我们努力学。”
    周总理非常关心这个社和社员的收入。他不断问到这个社去年收成的情况，社长告诉总理：去年全社收入十六万元，今年计划收入五十六万元。总理说：这可真是大丰收，大跃进。接着周总理还参观了这个社的红薯火炕育苗。
    这个社今年要种八百亩红薯，全部是采取火炕育苗法。火炕育苗可以提前下种，增加产量，又可以防治红薯黑斑病。全社八百亩全部推广火炕育苗法，今年要保证亩产一万斤，争取一万二千五百斤。
    周总理在参观了火炕育苗法以后，访问了这个社第三生产队队长张运保的家庭。张运保解放前是个贫农，家里很苦，解放后生活年年上升，去年盖了三间新屋。周总理走进了他的房间，看了看屋内清洁整齐的摆设，他问张运保：你家粮食够吃不够吃？张运保说：够吃，还吃不完。
    勉励下放干部好好锻炼
    下午四点多钟，周总理来到了燕庄乡的常寨农业社。这里正在开下放干部会议。人们一下子就把周总理围了起来。当周总理知道他们是下放干部之后，就关切地问：“你们来了多长时间了？生活习惯不习惯？”周总理拍着一位下放同志的肩头说：“现在肩膀还痛不痛？”他又转过身来向旁边走着的女同志饶有风趣地问：“你们哭了没有？”人们齐声回答道：“没有！”随着坚定地回答，是一阵爽朗的笑声。这时，人们都感到仿佛有一股暖流，流遍全身。总理是这样地关怀下放干部，而又这样地平易近人。总理勉励下放干部要好好劳动锻炼，改造思想，并且要好好向老农民虚心学习。
    周总理一面走，一面详细地询问着社里的情况。从劳力到生产，到社里今年的增产规划，以及下放干部的劳动状况，真是无微不至。当周总理要离开常寨农业生产合作社的时候，还一再问：“下放干部怎么样？”并且谆谆嘱咐这里的乡、社干部说：“你们得好好使用他们，他们也要帮助你们搞点文化学习。”
    人们都没有来得及留意到时间，但是太阳已经快落下地平线了。人们恋恋不舍地送走了敬爱的周总理。
    周总理走了，但是人们并没有马上平静下来。人们都感到周总理给他们带来了力量，带来了鼓舞。关虎屯农业社的干部决定在当天晚上就开群众大会，讨论如何根据周总理的指示，保证今年增产计划的全部实现；常寨社的下放干部，也表示“红在农村，专在农村”，把一切贡献给农业生产大跃进。他们共同的心愿是：保证完成生产跃进规划，给党中央送喜报，感谢周总理的关怀。
