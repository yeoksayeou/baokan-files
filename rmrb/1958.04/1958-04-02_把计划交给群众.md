    Handing the Plan Over to the Masses
    Tian Lianqian
    Agricultural cooperatives in various regions have different approaches when formulating this year's production plan. These approaches can be summarized into two types. One is to mobilize the masses to participate in drafting the plan; or the leadership drafts a preliminary plan and then submits it to the masses for detailed discussion and revision, before finalizing it. This kind of plan generally has both advanced production increase targets and practical measures for achieving those increases. After the plan is made, the members are full of confidence and fight for its realization.
    However, some cooperatives are not like this; they take a completely different approach. Some cooperatives initially have a production plan drafted by a few cadres, without discussing it with the cooperative members; others have a draft plan discussed by the masses several months ago, but later the production increase targets are repeatedly raised without going through mass discussion; still others have it discussed by the masses, but the discussion is not detailed or practical enough, so that some production increase targets are not realistic, and some measures are insufficient or not active enough; or the proportions between various targets are unreasonable. These cooperatives' plans have not truly become the plans of the masses themselves, and it is difficult to guarantee that they will be transformed into mass action. Any cooperative with this situation needs to make up for it: handing the production plan over to the cooperative members, letting everyone fully discuss it, and revising, adding to, and supplementing the various targets and measures, so that the production plan is more proactive and reliable. Only in this way will the masses fight to realize this plan.
    Some cooperative cadres are afraid that the cooperative members have "right-leaning conservative ideas" and that the plan will not be "passed" by everyone if it is announced. This idea is absurd: how can the production plan be kept secret from the cooperative members! The production plan is a public matter for all cooperative members, not a private matter for a few cadres. Only what is formulated by the masses themselves and can be understood and accepted by the masses has practical value. Otherwise, it can only be empty talk, and it is difficult to achieve. Even if the plan is not allowed to meet the masses now, it will still have to be met at the time of contracting work and production. In 1956, a part of the cooperatives could not implement contracting work and production, the reason was that these plans had not been discussed with the masses beforehand. Such lessons should not be repeated.
    If the plan is handed over to the masses, will it really not be passed? This depends on whether the plan itself has a solid basis and measures. If it does, the masses will generally accept it. If the masses truly do not accept the advanced plan because of conservative ideas, then we cannot fail to touch these ideas, because wrong ideas will not disappear on their own. And mobilizing the masses to discuss the production plan is an effective way to overcome conservative ideas and improve production enthusiasm. We should believe that the positive factors in the masses will definitely defeat the negative factors. Fearing that the masses have conservative ideas and not daring to hand the plan over to the masses for discussion, this idea is a manifestation of not believing in the masses and not understanding the mass line, and must be thoroughly corrected.

    把计划交给群众
    田连阡
    各地农业合作社在制订今年的生产计划的时候，有各种不同的做法。这些做法可以归纳成两种。一种是发动群众大家来订；或者是由领导上订出个样子交给群众详细讨论修正，最后定案。这种计划一般是既有先进的增产指标，又有切实的增产措施。计划订出之后，社员们就满怀信心地为实现这个计划而奋战。
    但是也有一部分合作社情形不是这样，他们完全是另外一种做法。有的社一开始就是由少数干部拟订生产计划，不经社员群众讨论；有的是在几个月前制订计划草案时经群众讨论过，但是后来增产指标一再提高，却没有经过群众讨论；有的是经群众讨论了，但讨论得不细致，不切实，以致有的增产指标不切合实际，有的措施不充分、不积极；或者是各种指标之间比例不合理。这些合作社的计划，还没有真正成为群众自己的计划，当然也就难以保证它变成群众的行动。凡有这种情况的合作社，都有必要来一次补课：把生产计划交给社员群众，让大家充分讨论，对各项指标和措施加以修正、增订、补充，使生产计划更加积极而又可靠。只有这样，群众才会为实现这个计划而奋斗。
    有的合作社干部怕社员有“右倾保守思想”，怕公布了计划大家“通不过”。这种想法是很荒谬的：生产计划怎么能向社员保密呢！生产计划是全体社员的公事，不是少数干部的私事。只有群众自己制定的和群众能够了解和接受的，它才有实际的价值。否则只能是纸上谈兵，很难实现。即使现在不让计划跟群众见面，到了包工包产的时候，还是得见面。1956年曾经有一部分合作社包工包产包不下去，原因就是这些计划事先未经群众讨论。这样的教训不应当再重复。
    计划交给了群众，是不是真会通不过呢？这要看计划本身是否有确实的根据和措施。如果有，群众一般是会接受的。如果群众真正是因为有保守思想而不接受先进的计划，那我们也不能不去触动这种思想，因为错误思想是不会自行消逝的。而发动群众讨论生产计划，则是克服保守思想、提高生产积极性的有效办法。我们应当相信群众中的积极因素一定会战胜消极因素。害怕群众有保守思想而不敢把计划交给群众讨论，这种想法是不相信群众、不懂得群众路线的表现，必须彻底纠正。
