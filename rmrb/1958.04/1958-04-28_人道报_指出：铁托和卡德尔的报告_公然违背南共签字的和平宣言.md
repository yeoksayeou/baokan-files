Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 26th: The French Communist Party's organ, "L'Humanité," has recently published a series of commentaries on the reports by Tito and Kardelj at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

In commenting on Tito's report, "L'Humanité" said that it was very regrettable that Tito equated two policies that are fundamentally different in terms of their social nature—the Soviet policy, which is peaceful in essence, and the imperialists' policy, which is aggressive in essence. "L'Humanité" pointed out that Tito's explanation of the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization by citing so-called Stalin's uncompromising foreign policy is a blatant violation of the peace declaration signed by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in Moscow.

The newspaper also accused Tito of forgetting the struggle between the socialist world system and the capitalist system. "L'Humanité" asked: Doesn't the so-called non-participation in two camps weaken this struggle?

In commenting on Kardelj's report, "L'Humanité" wrote: Kardelj's report confirms the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's determination to maintain its existing position. "L'Humanité" criticized the argument that Yugoslavia adopts an attitude of standing between the two blocs. The newspaper said: These arguments not only violate the declaration of the twelve socialist countries' communist and workers' parties signed in Moscow (Yugoslavia did not participate in signing this declaration), but also violate the peace declaration issued by the sixty-four communist and workers' parties, of which the representative of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia was one.

"L'Humanité" added: The peace declaration clearly points out that U.S. imperialism is responsible for international tensions and that the unity of socialist countries and all communist and workers' parties must be strengthened. It is significant that this declaration was not mentioned at all in the speeches of the delegates to the LCY Congress or in the discussions of the various committees of the Congress.

    “人道报”指出：铁托和卡德尔的报告
    公然违背南共签字的和平宣言
    新华社巴黎26日电　法国共产党机关报“人道报”最近连续评论了铁托和卡德尔在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会上的报告。
      “人道报”在评论铁托的报告时说，非常令人惋惜的是，铁托把从社会性质上说来根本不相同的两种政策——本质上是和平的苏联政策和本质上是侵略的帝国主义者的政策——相提并论。“人道报”指出，铁托拿所谓斯大林的不妥协的外交政策来解释北大西洋公约组织的建立，这样的解释是公然违背南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在莫斯科签署的和平宣言的。
    这家报纸还指责铁托忘记了社会主义世界体系和资本主义体系之间的斗争。“人道报”问道：所谓不参加两个阵营，难道不正是削弱这一斗争吗？
    “人道报”在评论卡德尔的报告时写道：卡德尔的报告证实了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟决心保持现有的立场。“人道报”批评了关于南斯拉夫采取站在两个集团之间的态度的论点。这家报纸说：这些论调不仅违背在莫斯科签署的十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党的宣言（南斯拉夫没有参加签署这个宣言），而且也违背六十四个共产党和工人党发表的和平宣言，而南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表是这六十四个共产党和工人党当中的一个。
      “人道报”又说：和平宣言清楚地指出美帝国主义应对国际紧张局势负责，指出必须加强社会主义各国和所有共产党和工人党的团结一致。有意义的是，在南共代表大会的代表们的发言中或是在代表大会各个委员会进行的讨论中，丝毫没有提到这个宣言。
