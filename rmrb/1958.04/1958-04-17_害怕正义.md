A Note

    Afraid of Justice
    Italian Prime Minister Zoli recently announced that the Italian Communist Party would not be allowed to use Italy's radio and television networks in the election like other political parties.
    Isn't the Italian ruling group loudly touting how "democratic" they are, and how their elections are "democratic elections"? Zoli's actions are precisely a great irony to these "democratic countries."
    But behind this irony actually reflects the fragility of the Zoli government. He is clearly so afraid of the Communist Party's just voice.

    害怕正义
    意大利总理佐利最近宣布：不许意大利共产党像其他政党那样，在竞选中使用意大利的电台与电视网。
    意大利统治集团不是大吹大擂地说他们是如何地“民主”，而他们的选举又是“民主选举”吗？佐利的这种作法恰恰是对这些“民主国家”的绝大讽刺。
    但是在这种讽刺背后实际上反映了佐利政府的脆弱。他显然是多么害怕共产党的正义的声音。
