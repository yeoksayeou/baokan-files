Hebei Promotes "Funing-style" Small Blast Furnaces
Total Investment of 40,000 Yuan, Construction Time of One Month, Annual Production of 2,000 Tons of Pig Iron
(Our newspaper, Baoding, 2nd dispatch) How can counties with resource conditions build small-scale iron and steel plants in the shortest time and with the least amount of capital? Funing County, Hebei Province, has built a small blast furnace iron and steel plant with an annual output of 2,000 tons of pig iron, providing a successful experience. At the recent Hebei Provincial Local Industry Planning Conference, it was decided that the province would vigorously promote the experience of "Funing-style" small blast furnaces this year.

This plant adopted a construction policy of making do with whatever is available. The total investment, including mining and iron smelting, was more than 40,000 yuan. The time for testing and construction took only four months, and it was officially put into production at the end of January this year. If such a small blast furnace were built now, it would only take one month. This small blast furnace not only has a low utilization coefficient and low cost, but also produces iron of good quality, which can be used for general agricultural machinery castings. By the end of March, the plant had produced more than 200 tons of pig iron to supply the needs of farm tool factories in five counties of the Tangshan Special District for making farm tools, which has been well received by users.

In the current situation of insufficient supply of equipment, the construction of Funing-style small blast furnaces is also easy to solve. The outer shell of the iron smelting furnace in this plant is mostly made of blue bricks, and the Roots blower used is manufactured by the Yangliuqing Iron Factory in the Tianjin Special District.

Because the technology of this small blast furnace is simple, most new workers who do not understand smelting technology learn by operating and studying at the same time, and master the iron smelting technology within a month or so. Now, the plant has trained more than 20 technical workers for the expansion of a small blast furnace.

This small blast furnace can fully utilize resources because of its small production volume. As long as there are 100,000 tons of iron ore, it can smelt iron for more than ten years. If the ore is exhausted in one place, it will not cost much to move it to another place with ore and build it up quickly. This kind of small blast furnace is especially suitable for construction in mountainous areas. According to the principle of taking materials locally and selling them locally, there is no need to build railways to build a factory for production.

The volume of the small blast furnace in Funing County is 6.5 cubic meters, which is smaller than the 8 cubic meter small blast furnace built in Suzhou last year.

    河北推广“抚宁式”小高炉
    全部投资四万元建设时间一个月年产生铁二千吨
    本报保定2日电　有资源条件的县如何用最短的时间、最少的资金兴建小型炼铁厂？河北省抚宁县建成了一座年产生铁二千吨的小高炉炼铁厂，提供了一个成功的经验。在最近召开的河北省地方工业规划会议上，决定今年全省大力推广“抚宁式”小高炉的经验。
    这个厂采用了因陋就简的建设方针，包括采矿、炼铁等全部投资四万多元，连试验和建厂时间只用四个多月，在今年1月底就正式投入生产了。如果现在建设这样的小高炉，只要一个月就行了。这个小高炉不仅利用系数较低，成本低，而且冶炼出来的铁质量较好，一般农业机械铸件都可以使用。到3月底，这个厂已生产了二百多吨生铁供应唐山专区五个县农具厂制作农具的需要，得到用户的好评。
    在当前器材设备供应不足的情况下，建设抚宁式的小高炉也容易解决。这个厂的炼铁炉外壳大部分是用青砖砌成的，使用的罗茨式鼓风机是由天津专区杨柳青铁工厂制造的。
    这个小高炉因为技术简单，大部分不懂冶炼技术的新工人，采用边操作边学习，在一个多月内就掌握了炼铁技术。现在，这个厂已为扩建一座小高炉培养了二十多名技术工人。
    这个小高炉由于生产量小，能够起到充分利用资源的作用。只要有十万吨的铁矿石，就可以炼铁十多年。如果在一个地方矿石开采完了，花用不了多少钱，就可以搬到另一个有矿石地方很快地建设起来。这种小高炉，特别适合于在山区建设，根据就地取材，就地销售的原则，不必修建铁路，就可以建厂生产。
    抚宁县小高炉的容积是六点五立方公尺，比苏州在去年建成的八立方公尺小高炉还小。
