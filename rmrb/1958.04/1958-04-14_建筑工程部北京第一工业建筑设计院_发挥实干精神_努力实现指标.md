Beijing First Industrial Architectural Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering
    Give Play to the Spirit of Hard Work and Strive to Achieve Targets

    (Our report) The Beijing First Industrial Architectural Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, after formulating plans, targets, and measures during the Two-Anti campaign, the leadership promptly guided the masses to engage in thorough and meticulous hard work and practical work, achieving significant results.

    After the institute formulated plans, targets, and specific measures for the entire institute and its various sections and offices at the end of February and the beginning of March, the masses were very enthusiastic, but some were afraid that they would not be able to achieve them, and the plans would become mere talk on paper. They said, "We have had plans in the past, but it is not easy to deliver on them." The leadership felt that it was necessary to seize the opportunity and advance victoriously, guiding the enthusiasm of the masses to production practice in a timely manner, so that plans and measures would not fall through. Thus, a production upsurge of "using both hands and brains, working hard and practically" was launched throughout the institute. After a month of effort, as of March 31, they had already exceeded the planned targets for March, with a total output value of 459,100 yuan, accounting for 242% of the plan, more than 60,000 yuan more than the first quarter of last year. The average monthly output per person in the institute reached 823 yuan, 1.4 times higher than planned and more than two times higher than the same period last year. Now, they have revised and formulated the planned targets for April and the overall plans and measures based on this foundation.

    In the process of realizing plans, targets, and measures, the institute, from the leadership to the masses, indeed put in effort and sweat. The primary step for leading cadres to take the lead in realizing the plan is to transform their leadership style and methods. From the institute to the sections and offices, many leading comrades changed the past practice of only reviewing, approving, and signing, and personally went deep into the workshops (i.e., design teams) to participate in production and lead production. Many section chiefs and chief engineers have already achieved the requirement in the plan of spending half of their time in the workshop leading production and solving problems every day; some section chiefs who did not understand production technology in the past have also begun to learn technology.

    Because the leadership personally participates in production and leads production, it is possible to discover and solve new contradictions in production practice in a timely manner. For example, the mutual cooperation and coordinated action of various types of work in design work is very important for the design work to leap forward, but in specific practice, it was found that some types of work could not keep up due to subjective and objective reasons. The Second Office encountered such a situation in the design of the Inner Mongolia Biological Pharmaceutical Factory project in March. This design task was urgent, but the drainage and water supply work was relatively complex and there were not enough people to keep up. If this type of work could not keep up, it would drag down the entire design project. In the face of such a contradiction, some people began to feel somewhat disappointed, saying, "Plans and measures are easy to formulate, but it is really not that simple to implement them." The leadership, in leading production in depth, discovered this contradiction and also discovered the "mass sentiment," so it immediately convened a coordination meeting of various types of work, calling on everyone to find ways to overcome difficulties and fully meet the client's requirement to issue drawings 25 days in advance. As a result, they came up with ways to simplify drawings, simplify work methods, and support the drainage and water supply work, and this contradiction was resolved. When this contradiction was resolved, another contradiction arose. Budget estimation is the most important part of the design work. If this work is not done well, there is no way to know whether the entire design is in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. However, in the past, this was precisely the weakest link, and often the construction unit was already under construction, but the budget estimation still could not be issued. In the design project of the Inner Mongolia Biological Pharmaceutical Factory, the leadership mobilized the masses to solve this contradiction in a timely manner. The designers and the comrades responsible for budget estimation adopted a comprehensive collaboration method. When the designers were drawing, the comrades doing the budget estimation sat next to them and worked together, watching and calculating in their hands at the same time. In this way, when the drawings were made, the budget estimation was also made. Because the leadership paid attention to solving contradictions in a timely manner, this project was completed 25 days ahead of schedule.

    The spirit of the leading cadres in delving deep to solve problems further encouraged the enthusiasm of all cadres. Many people have concretized the "give play to initiative and creativity, break old and establish new" in the plan with practical actions. For example, in the design project, the work of collecting data was always collected and sent by the construction unit in the past. If the data was not suitable, the designers had to make another trip, which was both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Now, they have changed the situation of waiting for data and actively help the construction unit collect data. Another example is in the design process. In the past, the issuance of a preliminary design document for a project had to go through the civil engineering team, the office, various types of work, the budget chief engineer, the director of the institute, printing, blueprinting, and binding, and finally be issued by the finished product distribution office. It took a total of twelve steps, and at least 22 people had to sign the document and drawings before it could be sent to the construction unit for review, and then wait for a month before it was reviewed back from the construction unit. In this way, even the preliminary design project would take two months. Obviously, this method cannot realize the leap forward plan. Comrades, according to the requirements of "breaking old and establishing new" in the plan, broke the old procedures and adopted new methods. For example, in the design project of the Agricultural Exhibition Hall, this set of methods was not adopted. Instead, the team first made a base map, and the chief engineer and chief architect went to the team to study the base map and formulate a plan. In this way, the team, the office, and the institute were all twisted together. Finally, they participated in the approval meeting of relevant units convened by the construction unit with this plan. Whoever had different opinions would raise them on the spot, solve them on the spot, and sign them on the spot. In this way, things that used to take two months to solve were solved here in two or three days.

    The spirit of hard work and practical work in this institute has encouraged and moved the construction units. Now, many construction units have written letters to pay their respects to them. A letter from the State-owned Baoding Paper Mill Construction Management Office wrote: You have completed the work of the past year in just one week. What an amazing leap forward! We take your spirit of selfless labor as our model and will guarantee to complete the construction task with more, faster, better, and more economical results with the same vigor as you.

    发挥实干精神　努力实现指标
    本报讯　建筑工程部北京第一工业建筑设计院在双反运动中制订出规划、指标、措施以后，领导上及时引导群众深入细致地苦干、实干，获得显著实效。
    这个院在2月底、3月初先后订出了全院和各科、室的规划、指标和具体措施，群众热情很高，但也有人怕实现不了，规划会变成纸上谈兵，他们说：“过去也不是没有计划，就是不容易兑现”。领导上感到：必须顺风张帆，乘胜前进，将群众的热情及时引导到生产实践中去，规划、措施才不致落空。于是在全院掀起了一个“动手动脑、苦干实干”的生产高潮。经过一个月的努力，截至3月31日为止，他们已经突破了3月份的计划指标，总产值完成了四十五万九千一百多元，占计划的242％，比去年第一季度完成的还多六万多元，月产量全院每人平均达八百二十三元，比计划提高了一点四倍，比去年同时期提高了二倍多。现在，他们已经在这个基础上，重新修改、制订了4月份的计划指标以及总的规划、措施。
    这个院在实现规划、指标、措施当中，从领导到群众确实费了力，出了汗。领导干部带头实现规划的首要一环是转变自己的领导作风和领导方法。从院到科、室，许多领导同志改变了过去只管审阅、批示、签字的情况，亲自深入车间，（即设计小组），参加生产，领导生产。许多室主任、主任工程师都已经做到规划中要求的每天有二分之一的时间在车间领导生产解决问题；一些过去不懂得生产技术的室主任，也已经在开始学习技术。
    由于领导上亲自参加生产，领导生产，就有可能及时发现、及时解决生产实践中的新的矛盾。比如设计工作中的各个工种互相配合，协同动作的问题，对于设计工作能否跃进关系很大，但是，在具体实践中，就发现有些工种由于主客观原因跟不上趟。二室在3月份设计的内蒙生物药品制造厂工程就曾碰到这样的情况。这个设计任务时间紧迫，但是，排水给水工种比较复杂，人力不足赶不上，这项工种赶不上，就会拉整个设计工程的后腿。面对这样的矛盾，曾有人开始产生某种程度的失望情绪，他们说：“规划、措施好订，实行起来可真不那么简单。”领导上在深入领导生产当中，发现了这个矛盾，也发现了“群众情绪”，就立即召开了各个工种的协作会议，号召大家想办法克服困难，充分满足甲方提前二十五天出图要求，结果想出了简化图纸，简化工作方法支援排水给水工种，这个矛盾就解决了。这个矛盾解决了，另一个矛盾又来了，概算是设计工作中最重要的一环，这项工作做不好，就没有办法知道整个设计是否合乎多、快、好、省的原则，但是，过去，这恰恰是最薄弱的一个环节，常常建设单位已经在施工了，预算、概算仍旧拿不出去。在内蒙生物药品制造厂的设计工程中，领导上发动群众及时解决了这个矛盾。设计人员和负责概算的同志采取全面协作的办法，设计人员在画图表的时候，搞概算的同志就坐在旁边一块做，一边看一边手里算，这样，图纸造好了，概算也造出来了。由于领导上及时注意解决矛盾，这项工程提前二十五天完成。
    领导干部深入解决问题的精神，更加鼓舞了全体干部的积极性，许多人把规划中的“发挥主动性、创造性，破旧立新”用实际行动具体化了。比如设计工程中的收集资料的工作，过去总是由建设单位收集送来，资料不合用，还要设计人员再跑一趟，既费时，又费事。现在，他们改变了坐等资料的情况，自己主动帮助建设单位收集资料。再比如：在设计程序上，在过去，发出一个工程设计的初步文件，要经过土建组、室、各工种、预算总工程师、院长、打印、晒图、装订，最后由成品发行室发出，一共要经过十二道关口，起码要有二十二个人在文件图表上签字后，才发给建设单位审核，再等上一个月，才从建设单位审回来。这样，仅仅初步设计工程，也得花上两个月的时间。这个办法，显然不能实现跃进规划，同志们根据规划中“破旧立新”的要求，打破了旧的程序，采取了新办法。比如在农业展览馆的设计工程中，就不是采取那一套办法，改为先由组内做张底图，主任工程师、总建筑师一起下组研究底图，制定方案，这样，组、室、院就捏在一起了。最后，带着这个方案参加由建设单位召开的有关单位的审批会议，谁有不同意见，当场提出，当场解决，当场签字。这样，过去两个月才能解决的事情在这里两、三天就解决了。
    这个院苦干、实干的精神鼓舞、感动了建设单位，现在，不少建设单位写信向他们致敬。来自国营保定造纸厂建厂管理处的一封信里写着：你们在短短的一个星期里，完成了过去一年的工作，这是多么惊人的跃进！我们把你们忘我劳动的精神作为自己的表率，要以和你们一样的干劲，保证多、快、好、省地完成建厂任务。
