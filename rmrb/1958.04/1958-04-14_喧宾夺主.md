    The Guest Usurps the Role of the Host
    On April 7, a French gendarmerie helicopter was forced to land by a US military aircraft while flying over the Haute-Marne department of France. The reason was that the French aircraft flew over the US Air Force base in Chaumont-Semoutiers.
    US military aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs can fly freely everywhere in France without any hindrance; while the aircraft of the French gendarmerie authorities are "forced to land" while flying in France. Although the French government has repeatedly declared that allowing the United States to establish military bases in France will not undermine French sovereignty, the fact is very clear that because of the presence of US military bases, France is no longer the master of its own airspace.

    喧宾夺主
    4月7日，法国宪兵的一架直升飞机在法国上马恩省上空飞行时被美国军用飞机强迫着陆了。其原因是，这架法国飞机经过了旭蒙—塞木提埃市美国空军基地的上空。
    带着氢弹的美国军用飞机在法国可以不受任何阻碍，到处乱飞；而法国宪兵当局的飞机在法国飞行却被“强迫着陆”。尽管法国政府曾经一再宣称，让美国在法国设立军事基地不会有损于法国的主权；但是事实却十分明白，由于有了美国军事基地，法国已经不再是自己领空的主人了。
