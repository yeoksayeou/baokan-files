Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th - News: The Japanese Socialist Party proposed a motion of no confidence in the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet at the plenary session of the House of Representatives this afternoon. After Takeo Miki, a representative of the Liberal Democratic Party, expressed his opposition to the Socialist Party's proposal, the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet immediately announced the dissolution of the House of Representatives. The general election will be held on May 22.

In its motion of no confidence in the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet, the Japanese Socialist Party pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet is not a cabinet trusted by the Japanese people because it is a conservative regime privately handed over by the Liberal Democratic Party after the general election held in February 1955, and has not gained the trust of the Japanese people. The Socialist Party accused Kishi Nobusuke of being one of the top leaders of Japanese militarists who launched the "Greater East Asia War," and also the chief culprit for Japan's loss of independence and the loss of life and property of a large number of people.

The Socialist Party pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's foreign policy has failed because it cannot point out the path that Japan should take to seek peace and security. On the contrary, it insists on submitting to the United States' foreign policy, rearming, and destroying the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, causing Japan's foreign policy to run into obstacles everywhere. The Japanese people are absolutely unwilling to entrust Japanese diplomacy to the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet.

The Socialist Party also criticized the failure of the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet's economic policy, which has led to the Japanese economy falling into the abyss of crisis. The 1958 budget compiled by the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet actively serves the interests of monopoly capital, forcing the general working people to live a hard life.

The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement when the Kishi Nobusuke government announced the dissolution of the House of Representatives, pointing out that this dissolution of the Diet is a victory for public opinion. The statement said that under the circumstances that the Japanese people criticized the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet for its diplomatic failures, economic helplessness, and continuous corruption, and the Socialist Party pursued the government's responsibility for the above-mentioned issues, it had no choice but to dissolve the Diet and hold a general election.

    在社会党不信任案的压力下
    日本政府解散众院
    据新华社25日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天下午在国会众议院全体会议上提出不信任岸信介内阁的决议案，自由民主党代表三木武夫表明反对社会党的提案后，岸信介内阁随即宣布解散众议院。大选将在5月22日举行。
    日本社会党在它的不信任岸信介内阁的决议案中指出，岸信介内阁不是得到日本人民信任的内阁，因为它是在1955年2月举行大选之后，由自由民主党私相授受的保守政权，并没有得到日本人民的信任。社会党指责岸信介是日本军国主义分子发动“大东亚战争”的最高负责人之一，他也是使日本丧失独立，使为数众多的人民丧失生命和财产的元凶。
    社会党指出，岸信介内阁的外交政策是失败了，因为它不能给日本人民指出日本应该走向寻求和平与安全的道路，相反地它却坚持屈从美国的外交方针，重整军备，破坏第四次日中贸易协定，使日本的外交政策到处碰壁。日本人民决不甘心情愿地把日本外交委托给岸信介内阁来办理。
    社会党也指责了岸信介内阁的经济政策的失败，以致促使日本经济陷入危机的深渊。岸信介内阁编制的1958年度预算是积极为垄断资本的利益服务，迫使一般劳动人民过着困苦的生活。
    日本社会党在岸信介政府宣布解散众议院的时候发表了一项声明，指出这次解散国会是国民舆论的胜利。声明说，在日本人民对岸信介内阁在外交上的失败、经济上毫无办法和不断出现贪污现象予以抨击以及社会党对上述问题追究政府责任的情况下，这次不得不解散国会，举行大选。
