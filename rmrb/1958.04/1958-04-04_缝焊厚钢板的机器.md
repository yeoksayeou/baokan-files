    Machine for Seam Welding Thick Steel Plates

    A great joyous event for the heavy machinery manufacturing industry – China's first electroslag welding machine has been successfully trial-produced in Shanghai.

    This electroslag welding machine can smoothly weld large steel plates with a thickness of 60 to 250 millimeters. Its efficiency is several times higher than that of automatic welding machines, and the quality of the weld is better than that of automatic welding machines.

    The successful manufacturing of the electroslag welding machine provides important technical equipment for China's heavy industry to manufacture large rolling mills, large boilers, and large ships. It can sew and weld various thick steel materials together like a sewing machine sewing clothes. In the past, the welding machines manufactured in China were mainly internationally common welding machines and some automatic and semi-automatic welding machines. These welding machines had lower production efficiency in welding thick steel plates, and the quality could not be fully guaranteed.

    Electroslag welding machines are the most advanced welding equipment internationally. This equipment and electroslag welding technology are unique new achievements of the Soviet Union. Many capitalist countries have not yet fully mastered this advanced technology. Under the assistance of the Soviet Union's drawings and data and Soviet experts, and with the strong support of the Shanghai Electrical Engineering Research Institute, Shanghai Electricity Meter Factory, Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory, and other units, the Shanghai Welding Machine Factory has finally successfully trial-produced this electroslag welding machine on the 31st of last month after more than a year of hard work.

    缝焊厚钢板的机器
    重型机械制造工业的一件大喜事——我国第一台电渣电焊机在上海试制成功。
    这种电焊机能顺利地焊接厚度达六十到二百五十公厘的大钢板，效率比自动电焊机高几倍，质量比自动电焊机焊的要好。
    电渣电焊机的制造成功，为我国重工业制造大型轧钢机、大型锅炉、大型船只提供了重要的技术设备。它可以像缝纫机缝衣服一样，把各种厚钢材缝焊在一起。过去，我国制造的电焊机主要是国际上通用的电焊机和一部分自动半自动电焊机。这些电焊机在厚钢板焊接方面生产效率较低，质量也不能完全有保证。
    电渣电焊机是国际上最先进的焊接设备，这种设备和电渣焊接技术，都是苏联独特的新成就，不少资本主义国家还未全部掌握这种先进技术。上海电焊机厂在苏联的图纸资料和苏联专家帮助下，以及在上海电工研究所、上海电表厂、上海华通开关厂等单位的大力支援下，经过一年多时间刻苦钻研，终于在上月31日将这种电渣电焊机试制成功。　（新华社）
