Vigorously Rectify Labor Organization: Huainan Coal Mine Takes the Lead
Increasing Production by 2 Million Tons While Reducing Personnel by 4,400

    (Our Dispatch) The Huainan Coal Mining Bureau's crude coal production target for this year has been raised from last year's 4.91 million tons to 6.91 million tons. Production efficiency has increased from 1.12 tons per worker to 1.4 to 1.56 tons, while the number of personnel will be reduced by approximately 4,400.

    This is the result of fully mobilizing the masses and relying on them to vigorously rectify labor organization.

    The bureau's past labor organization was not reasonable: among the bureau's more than 16,000 production workers, auxiliary workers accounted for 52.7%; non-production workers accounted for 12.3% of the enterprise's total staff. In the use of labor, waste was serious. For example, in the electromechanical section of Li Yi Mine, with 420 people, an average of more than 70 people were idle each day. The material supply section of this mine had 93 people in the transport team, and the sales section had another 45 people in the loading team. Both were engaged in transport work, but due to separate organizations, 63 workdays were wasted each day. In particular, some people mechanically understood and implemented the specialized responsibility system, setting up special personnel for tasks that could be done concurrently. During the rectification campaign, the masses widely exposed and criticized these wasteful phenomena, such as overstaffing, overlapping organizations, and excessively detailed division of labor, and demanded improvements in labor organization.

    Accepting the opinions of the masses, the bureau began to rectify labor organization in all mines simultaneously from the beginning of February, generally adopting the following measures: First, merging some operations that could be merged. For example, the loading and unloading teams of the Li Yi Mine's business management section were merged, reducing the number of people from 108 to 45; the transport material group and the material transport group of the transport and repair area were merged, reducing the number of people from 51 to 15; the Jiulonggang Mine merged the employee canteen and the nutrition station, reducing the number of people from 40 to 20. Second, implementing concurrent and cross-functional operations. For example, ironworkers and fitters, welders and riveters in the Li Yi Mine crossed over, reducing the number of people from 34 to 26; the chain plate driver in the business management section was concurrently held by the loading and unloading team, reducing 7 people; the Jiulonggang Mine adopted the same method, reducing lathe and fitter workers from 26 to 17, and ironworkers, riveters, and foundry workers from 32 to 15. Third, concentrating the use of workers of the same type of work who were originally scattered. For example, the electromechanical section, the business management section, and the transport and repair team were all equipped with carpenters, but the workload was not substantial. Now they are concentrated for unified use, the work is full, and the number of people is also reduced. Fourth, improving production technology. For example, chain conveyor was changed to remote control, and the downwind door was changed to automatic switch, and automatic signals were used for transportation instead of manual operation.

    Adopting these measures can reduce 4,398 people, accounting for 37.5% of auxiliary and non-production personnel. The proportion of auxiliary workers to direct production workers has decreased from the original 52.7% to 42.7%, and the proportion of non-production personnel to the total number of employees has decreased from the original 12.3% to 6.26%. In this way, the labor organization is much more reasonable than before. At the same time, the state can save 1.4 million yuan in wage expenditure throughout the year. The reduced personnel can be used to supplement individual units with insufficient labor, and more than 1,300 people can be drawn to organize rotational training to improve skills, and prepare technical backbones of main types of work for new mines. In addition, 300 technicians can be drawn to support local small coal mines. At present, the bureau has reduced 3,424 people, completing 77.9% of the plan. With fewer people, labor productivity has increased by 27% compared to before.

    The Huainan Mining Bureau also experienced a tortuous struggle in the process of rectifying labor organization. At the beginning, it first encountered resistance from various conservative ideas among the cadres. Some said: "What labor organization should be rectified? If you want to rectify, give me a few more people!" Some said: "Let the labor and wage section calculate the accounts for me. If there is any waste of labor, spank me!" "You can't reduce people, I have to be responsible for the work." There were also individual cadres who, upon hearing that people were to be reduced, took "preemptive action" and proposed to add people, making it difficult for the leadership to reduce people. In short, the idea that more people are good for doing things was common in all mines. Among the workers, there were also some concerns. The main concerns were: fear of being reduced, fear of being transferred to work, and fear of reduced wages.

    Faced with this situation, the party and government leaders of the bureau did not waver in the slightest and insisted on carrying out the task of rectifying labor organization to the end. Their basic experience has two points: First, planting "experimental fields." The leaders of the bureau had long known that the labor organization was unreasonable. They had wanted to rectify it in the past, but failed to do so. The reason was that they did not have a clear understanding of the labor usage situation. Every time they wanted to calculate the accounts, they could not outsmart the grassroots cadres. This time, the leaders of the bureau became smarter and stopped sitting in the office calculating the accounts. The fact that 50% of the office cadres were sent down and the work efficiency was not reduced inspired them, so they decided to conduct a pilot project for rectifying labor organization in Li Yi Mine. As a result, the auxiliary and non-production workers in this mine were reduced by 34%, the production was not affected, and the efficiency was also improved. In this way, their confidence became even stronger, shattering all the excuses of conservatism with facts, and learning a set of methods for rectifying labor organization from beginning to end.

    Another basic experience is to conscientiously implement the mass line and rely on the masses to do a good job in rectifying labor organization. First, mobilize the masses to speak freely and deeply expose the idleness and waste in labor organization. The actual examples exposed by the masses are the most powerful for criticizing the conservative ideas of some cadres. For example, the head of the electromechanical section of Li Yi Mine had very serious conservative ideas and kept shouting that people could not be reduced, but the masses sharply criticized the "three excesses" of their section with a large number of facts: too much bureaucracy; too much material usage; too much idleness and waste. This section has now reduced more than 70 people, and it is estimated that there is still potential to be tapped. Secondly, mobilize the masses to propose rationalization proposals for improving labor organization and rationally set staffing by ranking workload and calculating detailed accounts. The administrative section of Xie Yi Mine originally planned to reduce 45% of the personnel. After discussion by the masses, the actual reduction was 65%. Furthermore, the bureau relied on the masses to decide which people should be reduced and how to handle them after the reduction. The Huainan Mining Bureau adopted the method of the masses automatically proposing handling opinions and the leaders approving them, which the masses were relatively satisfied with. The bureau made serious and responsible arrangements for the reduced personnel. For example, replacing temporary workers, replenishing mining and basic construction teams, organizing sideline production (such as picking coal, washing dirty coal, weaving bamboo fences, and digging drainage ditches), and mobilizing old and weak workers to retire, so that everyone had a place to go. Therefore, the work proceeded very smoothly.

    The work of rectifying labor organization in the Huainan Mining Bureau is only the first step. The scope of rectification is limited to auxiliary departments and non-production departments. They plan to conduct a comprehensive rectification in all departments after the end of this step of work, and mainly focus on technological innovation and improving the level of technology to further tap potential labor force. At present, this work is being piloted in the Xinzhuangzi Mine.

    大力整顿劳动组织  淮南煤矿一马当先
    增产二百万吨煤减少四千四百人
    本报讯　淮南煤炭矿务局今年的原煤产量任务由去年的四百九十一万吨提高到六百九十一万吨，生产效率由每工生产一点一二吨提高到一点四至一点五六吨，而人员却要减少约四千四百人。
    这是他们充分发动群众，依靠群众大力整顿了劳动组织的结果。
    这个局过去的劳动组织是不够合理的：在全局一万六千多名生产工人中，辅助工人占到52.7％；非生产工人占企业全员的12.3％。在劳动力的使用上，浪费是严重的。如李一矿机电科四百二十人中，平均每天窝工七十多人；这个矿的器材供应科搬运组有九十三人，销售科装车组又有四十五人，两者同是搬运业务，由于分设机构，每天浪费六十三个工。特别是有些人机械地理解和执行专责制，本可兼作的事情也设专人。在整风中，群众对这些人浮于事、机构重叠、分工过细等浪费现象进行了广泛的揭发和批评，纷纷要求改善劳动组织。
    这个局接受群众的意见，从2月初开始，在全局各矿同时整顿劳动组织，一般采取了以下几项措施：一、合并一些可以合并的业务。如李一矿经营管理科的装车组与卸车组合并，由一百零八人减至四十五人；运修区运杂料组与运料组合并，由五十一人减至十五人；九龙岗矿将职工食堂与营养站合并，由四十人减至二十人。二、实行兼职作业和交叉作业。如李一矿铁工和钳工、电焊和铆工交叉作业，由三十四人减至二十六人；经营管理科链板司机由装运组兼任，减少七人；九龙岗矿采用同样方法，车钳工由二十六人减至十七人，铁工、铆工、铸工由三十二人减至十五人。三、将原来分散使用的同一工种的工人集中使用。如机电科、经营管理科和运修组都各配有木工，但工作量都不充实，现在统一集中使用，工作饱满，人员也减少了。四、改进生产技术。如链板运输机改为远距离操纵，并下风门改为自动开关，运输用自动信号代替人力操作等。
    采取这些措施，可以减少四千三百九十八人，占辅助工和非生产人员的37.5％。辅助工与直接生产工人比例由原来的52.7％。下降为42.7％，非生产人员占企业全员的比例由原来的12.3％下降为6.26％，这样，劳动组织就比以前合理多了。同时，全年可为国家节约工资开支一百四十万元，减少的人员可用补充个别劳力不足的单位，还能抽出一千三百多人组织轮训提高技术，并为新建矿井准备部分主要工种的技术骨干，此外，还可抽出三百名技工支援地方小煤窑。现在，这个局已减少了三千四百二十四人，完成计划数的77.9％。减了人，劳动生产效率比先前却提高了27％。
    淮南矿务局在整顿劳动组织的过程中也是经历了一番曲折的斗争的。一开始，首先在干部中间，就遇到了各种保守思想的抵触。有的说：“整什么劳动组织，要整给我多添几个人！”有的说：“叫劳动工资科给我来算帐，劳动力如有浪费打我的屁股！”“不能减人，我要对工作负责。”还有个别干部听说要减人，便“先发制人”，提出要加人，使领导上不好开口减人。总之，人多好办事的想法，各矿皆然。在工人里边，也有一些顾虑。主要是：怕被减，怕调动工作，怕降低工资。
    面对着这种情况，这个局的党政负责同志丝毫没有动摇，坚持要把整顿劳动组织的任务贯彻到底。他们的基本经验有两条：一是种“试验田”。劳动组织不合理，这个局的领导上是早就知道的。过去也想整顿，但是没能实现，原因就在于他们对劳动力使用情况不摸底。每次要是算帐，总是算不过基层干部。这次，局的领导同志变聪明了，不再坐在屋子里算帐。机关干部下放了50％而工作效率并没有减低这一事实启发了他们，他们决定到李一矿进行整顿劳动组织的试点。结果这个矿的辅助工和非生产工人减少了34％，生产没受影响，效率也提高了。这样，他们的信心更加坚定了，用事实粉碎了一切保守主义的遁词，并从始至终地学到了一套整顿劳动组织的方法。
    另一条基本经验是认真贯彻群众路线，依靠群众来做好整顿劳动组织的工作。首先发动群众鸣放，深刻揭发劳动组织上的窝工浪费。群众揭发出来的实际事例对批判某些干部的保守思想是最有力的。如李一矿机电科科长保守思想很严重，口口声声叫喊不能减人，可是群众用大量事实尖锐地指责了他们科的“三多”：官僚主义多；材料使用多；窝工浪费多。这个科现在已减了七十多人，估计还有潜力可挖。其次，发动群众用排工作量、算细帐的方法提出改善劳动组织的合理化建议，合理定员。谢一矿行政科原计划减45％的人员，经过群众讨论，实际减了65％。再者，对减少哪些人，减少以后怎样处理，也依靠群众来做。淮南矿务局采取了群众自动提出处理意见，领导批准的方式，群众比较满意。对被减的人员，局里都作了认真负责的安置。如顶替临时工，充实采掘和基本建设队伍，组织副业生产（如拣煤、洗脏煤、编竹笆、挖排水沟等），动员年老体弱的工人退休，使各有所归。因之工作进行得很顺利。
    淮南矿务局整顿劳动组织的工作，还只是做了第一步。整顿的范围只限于辅助部门和非生产部门。他们准备在这一步工作结束以后，即在所有一切部门全面进行整顿，而且主要是从革新技术、提高技术水平上着眼来进一步挖掘潜在的劳动力。现在，这一工作正在新庄子矿进行试点。
