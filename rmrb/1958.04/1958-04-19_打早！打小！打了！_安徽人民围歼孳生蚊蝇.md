Strike Early! Strike Small! Strike Hard!
Anhui People Encircle and Annihilate Breeding Mosquitoes and Flies

(Our Newspaper Correspondent Qin Yuzhen reports) Strike Early! Strike Small! Strike Hard! The broad masses of the people of Anhui Province, displaying a spirit of hard work, have launched a massive encirclement and annihilation campaign against the mosquitoes and flies that are breeding, resolutely annihilating the mosquitoes and flies that are breeding before they take flight. This campaign has already achieved astonishing results.

Anhui Province launched a "Four Pests Elimination Assault Month" in March, centered on eliminating mosquitoes and flies. Now, the masses in various localities continue to sweep away mosquitoes and flies, mop up the remaining rats and sparrows, and expand their victory. In the movement, the Four Pests Elimination work is closely integrated with production, and time and labor are arranged in a unified way. For example, rats and sparrows are killed early and late, mosquitoes and flies are killed before and after meals, and sanitation is combined with manure accumulation, which solves the contradiction between production and Four Pests Elimination. In March, the average number of people participating in Four Pests Elimination across the province every day was more than 18.8 million. This Four Pests Elimination army used various tools to kill mosquitoes and flies, fill and dredge sewage ponds and ditches, build public toilets, fill unsanitary sewage pits and manure pits, build pig pens, sheep pens, and livestock corrals, and every household carried out a major cleanup. Many places also used chemicals to fumigate and kill mosquitoes and flies. In Bengbu City, during the assault month, the maximum number of people mobilized in one day was more than 240,000, accounting for 80% of the city's population. The Wei Si Road ditch in the city, known as "Dragon Beard Ditch," was swarming with mosquitoes and flies and piled with maggots every summer and autumn. This time, more than 5,000 workers and citizens were mobilized and worked hard for a day to dredge the entire five-li-long, three-meter-wide and three-meter-deep ditch. Fuyang Special District also carried out a comprehensive cleanup, and beds, furniture, and all pots and cans were moved and washed thoroughly. The inside and outside of the houses were generally washed clean. Several cities such as Wuhu, Bengbu, and Hefei, and some counties, generally used "666" smoke fumigant to fumigate houses and sewers. Every household in Wuhu City has tools for killing mosquitoes and flies. Every noon and evening, on the streets and alleys, in parks and courtyards, there are people catching mosquitoes and flies everywhere. In March, Xiao County filled more than 90,000 sewage ponds and manure pits, and built more than 160,000 new toilets and livestock enclosures. In more than a month, according to statistics, the province has eliminated more than 3.01 million boxes of mosquitoes, 5.24 million boxes of flies, dug more than 4.19 million catties of pupae, cleared more than 6.51 million sewage ditches, treated more than 3.89 million sewage ponds and ditches, built more than 1.81 million toilets, and cleared more than 1.03 billion dan of garbage.

While eliminating mosquitoes and flies and their breeding grounds, various localities also adopted the "all-out general offensive" tactic to inflict a devastating blow on the remaining rats and sparrows.

    安徽人民围歼孳生蚊蝇
    本报讯　记者秦聿震报道：打早！打小！打了！安徽省广大人民拿出苦干精神，向正在孳生的蚊蝇发起了一个声势浩大的围剿战役，坚决把正在孳生的蚊蝇歼灭在起飞之前。现在这个战役已获得惊人的成绩。
    安徽省在3月份开展了以消灭蚊蝇为中心的除四害突击月。现在各地群众仍继续扫荡蚊蝇，清剿残余鼠雀，扩大胜利。在运动中，除四害工作紧紧结合生产，统一安排了时间和劳动力，如早晚打鼠雀，饭前饭后打蚊蝇，打扫卫生结合积肥等办法，解决了生产和除四害的矛盾。3月份全省每天平均参加除四害的人数有一千八百余万人。这支除四害大军，用各种工具捕杀蚊蝇，填平和疏通污水塘、污水沟，建立公共厕所，填平不合卫生条件的污水坑和粪池，修建猪圈、羊圈和耕畜栏，家家户户大扫除，很多地方还用药剂熏杀蚊蝇。蚌埠市在突击月中，最多一天曾出动二十四万多人，占全市人口80％，市里被称为“龙须沟”的纬四路大沟，每逢夏秋季节，蚊蝇成团，蛆成堆，这次发动五千多工人和市民，苦战一天，把这个五华里长，宽、深三公尺的大沟全部疏通了。阜阳专区又进行了全面的大扫除，床铺、家具和所有盆盆罐罐都进行了大搬家，大洗刷，屋里屋外普遍洗刷得干干净净。芜湖、蚌埠、合肥等几个市和一部分县，普遍使用了“六六六”烟熏剂熏了房屋和下水道。芜湖市家家户户都置有灭蚊蝇的工具，每到中午和傍晚，大街小巷，公园庭院，到处都有捕捉蚊蝇的人。萧县在3月份就填平污水池和粪坑九万多个，新建厕所和牲畜圈栏十六万多处。一个多月来，据统计，全省共消灭蚊子三百零一万多盒，苍蝇五百二十四万盒，挖蛹四百一十九万多斤，清除污水沟六百五十一万多条，处理污水塘、沟三百八十九万多处，修建厕所一百八十一万多处，清除垃圾十亿三千多万担。
    在消灭蚊蝇和蚊蝇孳生场所的同时，各地还采取“全线总出击”的战术，给残余鼠雀进行了毁灭性的打击。
