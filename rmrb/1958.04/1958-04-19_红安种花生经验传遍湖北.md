    Hong'an's Peanut Planting Experience Spreads Throughout Hubei

    (Our report) The advanced experience of Hong'an County in peanut planting has been widely promoted in Hubei Province. The area planting "Hong'an Upright Peanuts" is also increasing.

    Hong'an County's peanut planting experience has been valued by relevant departments since 1956. Since then, many peanut-producing areas have learned from Hong'an County's practices in some key technical aspects and leadership methods. In 1957, the Provincial Department of Agriculture organized representatives from various peanut-producing areas to visit Hong'an for on-site observation and organized discussions. This prompted many areas to change the phenomenon of emphasizing grain and cotton while neglecting oil crops. For example, after visiting Hong'an, Jingmen, Tianmen and other counties combined the Hong'an experience with local characteristics, making full use of more than 100,000 mu of wasteland and sandy land suitable for peanut planting to expand the area under peanut cultivation. According to statistics, the peanut planting area in the province was only 860,000 mu in 1956. Last year it increased to 1,080,000 mu, and this year it has further expanded to 1,370,000 mu, which has played a positive role in ensuring increased peanut production throughout the province.

    Peanut-producing areas in Hubei Province have also paid attention to promoting the superior variety of "Hong'an Upright Peanuts." This year, the area sown with this type of peanut has expanded by more than one and a half times compared to last year, accounting for about 58% of the province's peanut area.

    Another important gain for the peanut-producing areas across the province in learning from Hong'an's experience is the implementation of intensive and meticulous cultivation of peanuts. Many areas have increased the density of peanut planting compared to the past, broken the old habit of not fertilizing peanuts, and greatly strengthened field management of peanut fields.

### 红安种花生经验传遍湖北

    红安种花生经验传遍湖北
    本报讯　红安县种植花生的先进经验已在湖北省普遍推广。种植“红安直立花生”的地区也愈来愈多。
    红安县种植花生的经验，从1956年开始就受到有关部门的重视，许多花生产区从那时起在一些主要技术环节和领导方法上学习了红安县的做法。省农业部门在1957年组织各花生产区派代表到红安进行现场参观并组织讨论后，促使许多地区改变了重粮棉、轻油料的现象。如荆门、天门等县在参观后结合当地特点，充分利用十多万亩荒地和适宜种花生的沙地，扩大种植花生面积。据统计，全省花生播种面积1956年只八十六万亩，去年增加到一百零八万亩，今年又进一步扩大到了一百三十七万亩，对于保证全省花生增产起到了良好作用。
    湖北省花生产区还注意推广“红安直立花生”良种。今年，全省播种这种花生的面积比去年扩大一倍半以上，占全省花生面积58％左右。
    全省花生产区学习红安经验的另一重要收获是对花生实行了精耕细作，许多地区花生种植密度比过去增加，并且打破了花生不施肥的老习惯，对花生地的田间管理也大为加强。
