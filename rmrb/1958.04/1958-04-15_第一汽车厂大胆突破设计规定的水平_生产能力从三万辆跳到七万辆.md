From our Changchun Correspondent, April 14th, Chen Zilin, Li Detian reporting: The First Automobile Works recently broke through design standards through a production review method. Without increasing equipment or manpower, daily output per shift increased from 50 to 100 vehicles, effectively turning one automobile factory into two. Without needing to increase any equipment or investment, the annual output can reach 70,000 vehicles (the original design was for 30,000). Originally planned to produce more than a dozen products before 1962, now it can be increased to 80 kinds, of which the new type of car can be increased from 18 to 40 kinds. The main new products, such as sedans, three-axle off-road vehicles, gas vehicles, agricultural dump trucks, universal vehicles, liquefied petroleum gas vehicles, tractors, and bus chassis, can all be successfully trial-produced this year.

During the double-anti movement, the factory, based on the demands of the workers, started with discussions on this year’s production plan and the three-year production leap forward plan, mobilizing the masses to discuss how to leap forward, while examining and criticizing the thoughts, work styles, and various rules and regulations that hindered the leap forward. In practice, the stamping workshop took the lead, creating a new record of 121 cabs produced per shift. The factory Party committee seized this initiative and promptly proposed that all workshops universally implement a production review of 100 vehicles per shift, ensuring quality and safety, in order to further break through conservative thinking, tap production potential, and determine leap forward measures. After only an initial review, automobile production increased from the designed 50 vehicles per shift to 100 vehicles per shift, with good quality and production safety.

In the past, many engineering and technical personnel at this factory were not good at boldly enriching and developing advanced automobile industry technology based on China's conditions and the practical experience of the workers. During this production review of 100 vehicles per shift, they further integrated with the workers, boldly innovating from aspects such as modifying designs, improving processes, changing product structures, and simplifying processing procedures, and promptly solved more than 1,000 key technical problems, playing a huge role in balancing production capacity on a new basis and achieving 100 vehicles per shift. In the past, many pieces of equipment in the chassis workshop could not reach the standard of 100 vehicles per shift. After repeated research and experimentation by process and design personnel, the process was improved and more than 20 processing procedures were simplified. All of the workshop’s more than 1,000 machine tools met the requirements for producing 120 automobile parts per shift. Because the design and trial production personnel broke through conservative thinking, alternative materials for more than a dozen major parts have recently been successfully trial-produced. For example, domestically produced cast iron and alloy steel are used to replace nickel-cast engine cylinder blocks, and production has already begun. Its wear resistance is the same as that of nickel-containing cylinder blocks. In terms of design methods, they changed the old design procedures and used the design method of producing drawings, proofreading, reviewing, and trial-producing at the same time, so that the design of each new car could be completed two to three months earlier.

The production review broke through many rules and regulations that hindered production. In the tool and material supply departments, the past mechanical division of labor was broken, and tools, materials, and labor protection supplies were actively delivered to the workshops in a timely manner. In the past, power and maintenance workers often waited for someone to find them when equipment failed. Now, they carry tools and easily damaged spare parts with them, revolving around the machines, troubleshooting on the spot, and not leaving work until the job is completed, ensuring that the equipment operates fully.

The mass-based, unconventional production review has pushed the factory's leadership style to a new level. During the intense production review, more than 250 leading cadres from workshop directors and branch secretaries upwards universally implemented forms such as "experimental fields" or working alongside workers, going deep into the workshops, so many new problems could be quickly resolved in half an hour or a dozen minutes. Therefore, the whole factory's high-load production rhythm is tight, normal, and orderly.

Now, the workers are in high spirits, widely studying technology, continuing to solve the key problems that have not been completely resolved in this review, and preparing for another great leap forward. In the forging workshop, there is a poem titled "Forging Worker's Heart," which can summarize the workers' mood:

Heroes from all walks of life,
Gallant men from all directions,
Displaying all their skills,
Each eager to be first.
Ignoring smoke and fire,
Sweating profusely without rest,
Why work so hard?
For peace, for happiness!
Elizabeth, listen carefully,
In less than fifteen years,
The dragon will be in front of you!

### 第一汽车厂大胆突破设计规定的水平  生产能力从三万辆跳到七万辆

    第一汽车厂大胆突破设计规定的水平
    生产能力从三万辆跳到七万辆
    本报长春14日电　记者陈子林、李得天报道：第一汽车制造厂最近半个月来，以生产大检阅的方法突破设计水平，在不增加设备和人力的情况下，由每班日产五十辆汽车提高到一百辆，等于一个汽车厂变成了两个汽车厂：不需要增加任何设备和投资，就可以年产七万辆汽车（原设计为三万辆）。原计划在1962年以前生产十几种产品，现在可以增加到八十种，其中新型汽车可以由十八种增加到四十种。小轿车、三轴越野车、煤气车、农业翻斗车、万能汽车、液化煤气车、牵引车、公共汽车底盘等主要新产品，今年就可以全部试制成功。
    这个厂在双反运动中，根据职工群众的要求，提出了从讨论今年生产计划和三年生产跃进规划着手，发动群众讨论如何跃进，同时检查和批判阻碍跃进的思想、作风和各种规章制度。在实践中，冲压车间一马当先，创造了班产一百二十一辆驾驶室的新纪录。厂党委抓住这一创举，即时提出各车间普遍推行保证质量、保证安全班产百辆汽车的生产大检阅，以便进一步突破保守思想，挖掘生产潜力，确定跃进措施。只经过初步检阅，汽车产量就由设计班产五十辆，提高到一百辆，而且质量好，生产安全。
    过去这个厂不少的工程技术人员，不善于根据我国情况，以及工人群众的实践经验，大胆地丰富和发展汽车工业的先进技术。在这次班产百辆汽车的生产大检阅中，他们和工人进一步密切结合，从修改设计、改进工艺、改变产品结构、简化加工工序等方面大胆革新，及时地解决了一千多个技术关键问题，对在新的基础上平衡生产能力，实现班产百辆汽车起了巨大的作用。底盘车间过去有不少设备达不到班产百辆汽车，经过工艺和设计人员反复研究试验，改进工艺，简化了二十多道加工工序之后，全车间一千多台机床，都达到了班产一百二十辆汽车零件的要求，由于设计试制人员打破保守思想，最近又有十几种主要零件的代用材料试制成功。比如用国产铸铁和合金钢代替镍浇铸的发动气缸体，已经开始生产，它的耐磨性能和含镍气缸体一样。在设计方法上，他们改变了旧的设计程序，用边出图、边校对、边审核、边试制的设计方法进行工作，使每种新汽车的设计，都可提前两三个月出图。
    大检阅冲破了许多障碍生产的规章制度，在工具、材料供应部门，打破了过去的机械分工，主动把工具、材料、劳动保护用品及时送进车间。动力、机修工人，过去往往在设备发生事故时，等人去找，现在则随身携带工具和易损备件，围着机器转，有故障当场抢修，不完工不下班，保证了设备充分的运转。
    群众性的打破常规的生产大检阅，把全厂的领导作风，推向新的境地。在紧张的生产大检阅中，从车间主任、支部书记以上的二百五十多个领导干部，普遍推行“试验田”或跟班劳动等形式，深入车间，所以许多新问题在半小时或十几分钟内就能迅速解决。因此全厂高负荷生产的节奏严密、正常，秩序良好。
    现在，工人们气势昂扬，正广泛地钻研技术，继续解决这次大检阅中尚未完全解决的关键问题，准备再来一个大跃进。在锻工车间里就贴着这样一首题为“锻工心里话”的诗，可以概括工人们的心情：
    各路英雄，
    四方好汉，
    平生武艺尽施展，
    个个跃跃欲争先。
    烟熏火烤全不顾，
    挥汗如雨未稍安，
    如此出力为何事？
    为和平，为幸福！
    伊丽莎白细听信，
    不出十五年，
    巨龙定在你前面！
