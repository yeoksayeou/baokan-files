    Providing Rich Scientific Data
    Soviet Second Satellite Burns Up
    Orbited 2300+ Times in Five Months, Traveled Over 100 Million Kilometers
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 15th (TASS): TASS communique on the burning up of the second artificial Earth satellite:
    The Soviet second artificial Earth satellite, launched into orbit on November 3, 1957, fell into the dense atmosphere and burned up on the morning of April 14th. According to available materials, the satellite's various parts disintegrated as it flew from northwest to southeast over the Lesser Antilles, Brazil, and the Atlantic Ocean.
    During the satellite's more than five months of existence, the parameters of its flight orbit (apogee height, orbital period, etc.) constantly changed due to the gradual resistance of the upper atmosphere.
    Valuable new data on the density of the upper atmosphere was obtained through observations of the above changes and the scientific study of a large amount of measurement data of the satellite's operational parameters.
    Through the second satellite, a grand specialized scientific measurement program related to the study of the Earth's ionosphere, the measurement of cosmic rays and radio wave propagation was realized, and some other problems in geophysics were solved for the first time.
    In addition to scientific instruments, the satellite also carried a specially designed container with the experimental animal, the dog Laika, making it possible to study the condition of biological organisms under space flight conditions.
    Many different Soviet organizations participated in the observation and scientific research of the measurement results. Many foreign observers also sent valuable materials.
    During its existence, the second satellite orbited the Earth approximately two thousand three hundred and seventy times, traveling over one hundred million kilometers.
    The satellite flew over all major populated areas on Earth many times, which it was able to do because it had a large orbital inclination angle of sixty-five degrees to the Earth's equatorial plane.
    The orbital inclination angle adopted by the Soviet satellite ensures that its operation can be seen from all inhabited places on Earth. The satellite's large size allowed residents all over the world to see it with the naked eye.

    苏联第二个卫星陨灭
    运行五个月二千三百多圈走过了一亿多公里的路程
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社莫斯科14日电：塔斯社关于第二个人造地球卫星陨灭的公报：
    1957年11月3日进入轨道的苏联第二个人造地球卫星于4月14日早晨落入稠密的大气层陨灭。据现有材料，卫星的各个部分是在它从西北往东南飞经小安的列斯群岛、巴西和大西洋的上空时散裂的。
    在卫星存在的五个多月期间，由于逐渐受到大气高层阻力的作用，卫星飞行轨道参数（远地点高度、运行周期等）不断发生变化。
    由于对上述变化过程的观测以及对于卫星运行参数的大量测量材料的科学研究，获得了关于大气高层密度的新的宝贵资料。
    通过第二个卫星，实现了有关研究地球电离层、测量宇宙线和无线电波传播的宏大专门科学测量计划，并且第一次解决了地球物理学中的某些其他问题。
    在卫星上除了科学仪器外，还有装着试验动物——小狗莱伊卡的特制容器，这样就有可能研究生物机体在宇宙飞行条件下的情况。
    苏联许多各种各样的组织都参加了观测和对测量结果进行科学研究的工作。外国许多观测者也送来了有价值的材料。
    第二个卫星在其存在期间围绕地球运行了二千三百七十圈左右，走了一亿多公里的路程。
    这个卫星曾经多次飞过地球上所有主要的居民点，它之所以能做到这一点，是由于它有一个与地球赤道平面成六十五度的大的轨道倾斜角。
    苏联卫星所采取的轨道倾斜角保证地球上所有有人居住的地方都可以看到它的运行。卫星体积之大使得全世界居民都可以用肉眼看到它。
