Moscow Music Conservatory has recently been filled with a festive atmosphere. Elegant piano and violin sounds constantly emanate from this apricot-yellow building. The words "Tchaikovsky International Piano and Violin Competition" are written in Russian on the roof of this building, and the national flags of the participating countries form a semicircle at the entrance. The international music competition is held here every day.

The Tchaikovsky International Piano and Violin Competition, which opened on March 18th, is not only a grand event in the Soviet music scene but also a major event in the world of music. The works of the great Russian musician Tchaikovsky have long been spread to every corner of the world, and from this competition, we can see how much musicians from various countries love Tchaikovsky's works. This international music competition, as many musicians say, is the music spring of Moscow. Many famous musicians, pianists, and violinists from various countries are gathered in Moscow. Among them are Soviet composers Shostakovich and Kabalevsky, as well as Oistrakh and Richter, who are familiar to the Chinese people, and the famous French violinist Billion and Italy's Da Vito, etc.

Although the participants in this competition are all under the age of thirty, their level of performance is very high. Many of them are musical geniuses or "child prodigies," and many started playing at a very young age. For example, Klimov, the gold medal winner of the violin competition, started practicing the violin at the age of five, entered the Odessa Music School at the age of seven, and has won three awards in recent international competitions. The youngest participant in the competition is only eighteen years old, and Liu Shikun from our country is one of them.

On the eve of the competition, we met Ma Sicong, a member of the judging committee for the violin competition. He said that the items in this competition are very difficult, and the participants must not only have very high performance skills but also have a rich sense of music. He also said that because the competition requires are very high, many countries have not been able to send representatives. Our country's ability to participate in this competition demonstrates the progress of our music scene in recent years. Of course, the help that the Soviet Union has given us in this regard has played a major role.

To illustrate the help that Soviet musicians have given us, we can cite the following example: At the end of March, the Moscow Conservatory organized a public solo recital for the young Chinese pianist Liu Shikun. The several programs performed by Liu Shikun were unanimously praised by everyone. Professor Feibert, who helped Liu Shikun practice, was even more pleased. He repeatedly praised Liu Shikun as "excellent." When someone told him that a key was malfunctioning, the old man personally ran up and down, calling people to repair it, and only stopped after it was repaired.

April 13th was the last competition. Liu Shikun's performance was the last item in the entire competition. The Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 he performed was magnificent. As soon as he finished playing the first movement, people couldn't help but cheer. In this cheering, we once again saw how happy and proud Soviet friends are for every success of ours. After the performance, many Soviet comrades went backstage to warmly congratulate Liu Shikun.

On the morning of the 14th, good news came: The results of the piano competition were announced: Liu Shikun, the young Chinese pianist, and Frassenko from the Soviet Union, both won second prize. The first prize went to Cliburn from the United States.

    莫斯科的音乐之春
    本报记者　崔永昌
    莫斯科音乐学院最近是一片节日气象。从这座杏黄色的楼房里不断传来优雅的钢琴声和小提琴声。在这座建筑物的屋顶上用俄文写着“柴可夫斯基钢琴和小提琴国际比赛”的字样，在入口处，参加比赛的国家的国旗围成了一个半圆形。国际音乐比赛每天就在这里举行。
    3月18日开幕的柴可夫斯基钢琴和小提琴国际比赛不但在苏联音乐界是一件盛事，而且在世界音乐生活中也是一件大事。俄罗斯大音乐家柴可夫斯基的作品早已传到世界每个角落，从这次比赛中，我们可以看到，各国音乐家对柴可夫斯基的作品是如何热爱。这次国际音乐比赛正如许多音乐家所说，是莫斯科的音乐之春。许多国家著名的音乐家、钢琴家和小提琴家在莫斯科济济一堂。这里有苏联的作曲家萧斯塔科维奇和卡巴列夫斯基，有我国人民熟悉的奥伊斯特拉赫和李赫特尔，有法国著名的提琴家比龙和意大利的达·维托等。
    参加这次比赛的人虽然全不超过三十岁，但是他们的演奏水平却是很高的。他们之中有很多人是具有音乐天才的“神童”，许多人很小就开始演奏。例如小提琴比赛金质奖章获得者克利莫夫，从五岁时起就练习小提琴，七岁进了敖德萨音乐学校，在近来的国际比赛中他三次得奖。比赛中最年轻的参加者只有十八岁，我国的刘诗昆就是其中之一。
    在比赛前夕，我们见到小提琴比赛评奖委员马思聪。他说，这次比赛的项目非常困难，参加的人不仅要有很高的演奏技巧，并且要有
  丰富的音乐感。他还说，因为比赛要求很高，所以许多国家没能派来代表。我国能参加这次比赛，正说明了我国音乐界几年来的进步。当然，苏联在这方面给我们的帮助是起了很大作用的。
    为了说明苏联音乐家对我们的帮助，可以举这样一个例子：3月底，莫斯科音乐学院为我国青年钢琴家刘诗昆组织了一次公开单人演奏会。刘诗昆演奏的几个节目受到了大家的一致赞扬。帮助刘诗昆练习的费伯特老教授更是非常高兴。他连连夸奖刘诗昆是“好样的”。当有人告诉他一个琴键出了毛病，这位老人就亲自跑上跑下，打电话叫人修理，直到修理好以后才停下来。
    4月13日是最后一场比赛。刘诗昆的演奏是这次整个比赛的最后一个项目。他所表演的柴可夫斯基第一钢琴协奏曲气派宏伟。当他刚弹完第一乐章时，人们便止不住地欢呼起来。在这欢呼声中，我们再一次看到苏联友人是如何为我们的每一个成功而高兴与骄傲。演奏结束以后，许多苏联同志都到后台向刘诗昆热烈祝贺。
    14日晨传来了佳音，钢琴比赛结果宣布了：我国青年钢琴家刘诗昆和苏联的弗拉森科双获二等奖。第一名是美国的克里伯恩。
