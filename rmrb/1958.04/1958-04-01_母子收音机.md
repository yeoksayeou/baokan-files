    Mother-Son Radio
    The Harbin Broadcasting Equipment Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a small, four-purpose mother-son radio.

    This DC radio, named "Spark," can receive audio, broadcast, conduct telephone conversations, and play records. It is most suitable for agricultural production cooperatives to establish small broadcasting stations; it can also be used to establish a telephone network between various cooperatives, centered on the township. The radio's power supply can use batteries, but a semiconductor generator is preferred. The complete set of equipment costs only a little over 300 yuan (including a semiconductor generator, record player cartridge, and other accessories).

    To broadcast records using the "Spark" four-purpose mother-son radio, the record player can be converted from a hand-cranked record player to overcome the difficulty of having no power source.

    母子收音机
    哈尔滨广播器材厂最近试制成功一种小型的四用母子收音机。
    这种名叫“星火”牌的直流收音机，可以收音、广播、通话和播送唱片。它最适合农业生产合作社建立小型广播站用；也可以用它以乡为中心建立各社队之间的通话网。收音机的电源可以利用电池，最好用半导体发电器。全套机器设备只需三百多元，（包括半导体发电器、唱机唱头等附属设备）
    用“星火”牌四用母子收音机来播送唱片，唱机可以利用手摇唱机来改造，以克服无电源的困难。
