Hunan is a province in China rich in oil-tea camellias. However, current yields are generally low. According to the Special Economic Section of the Provincial Forestry Department, if the successful three-linkage cultivation system for oil-tea camellia forests created by the Youshi Agricultural Cooperative in Shaoyang County can be promoted, this low-yield situation can be quickly changed.

The Youshi Cooperative has 3,200 mu of oil-tea camellia forests, with an average yield of 9.2 jin of oil per mu last year. However, three other high-yield oil-tea camellia plots, totaling more than seven mu, had average oil yields of 87.2 jin, 68.9 jin, and 62.3 jin per mu, respectively. The conditions of these three oil-tea camellia plots were not particularly superior; the main reason for the high yield was the implementation of the "winter land reclamation, spring cultivation and mound building, and intercropping with miscellaneous grains" three-linkage cultivation system. The three-linkage cultivation system is completed within two years. In these two years, except for the first year when the increase in production is not significant, the second year can increase production by about one time, and the third year can increase production by seven to nine times at the highest, and at least two times at the lowest. The specific methods of the three-linkage cultivation system are:

	(1) Land reclamation in winter, including pruning and removing ant nests. Because the trees are dormant at this time, there will be no tree wilting if the lateral roots are damaged during land reclamation or there are cuts when pruning. In winter, ant colonies gather in nests, which is convenient for eradication. Pruning mainly involves pruning the lower branches and diseased branches of fruiting trees to avoid wasting nutrients and suffering from diseases.

	(2) Cultivation and mound building in the second spring. Break up the large clumps of soil dug up during land reclamation into soil clumps with a diameter of five or six inches to allow the soil to continue to weather; turn up the grass roots and expose them to the sun to kill them. At the same time as cultivation, soil should be added to the tea mounds, and the area around the mounds should be built into a "turtle back" shape with fine soil, which can enhance drought resistance.

	(3) Intercropping with miscellaneous grains. Intercropping with miscellaneous grains begins the year after cultivation. In spring, carefully till the soil once to break it up, rake out the grass roots and burn them, and then plow the entire area again before sowing.

The production of oil-tea camellias in the Youshi Cooperative has not reached its peak. Currently, land reclamation is carried out once every ten years, and intercropping is only carried out for one year. It can be shortened to once every four to five years, or intercropping with miscellaneous grains can be carried out for a long time.

    油茶生产中的千里马
    由斯社实行三连环耕作制产量提高数倍
    本报讯　湖南是我国盛产油茶的省份。但是，目前产量普遍不高。据省林业厅特用经济处介绍，如能推行邵阳县由斯农业社创造成功的油茶林三连环耕作制，就能迅速改变这种低产局面。
    由斯社共有油茶林三千二百亩，去年每亩平均产油九斤二两。但是，另有三块共七亩多高产油茶林，每亩平均产油量却分别达到八十七斤二两、六十八斤九两、六十二斤三两。这三块油茶林的条件并不十分优越，丰产的主要原因是实行了“冬季垦复、春季中耕培蔸、间作杂粮”的三连环耕作制。三连环耕作制在两年内完成。这两年中除第一年增产不显著外，第二年约可增产一倍左右，第三年最高的可增产七到九倍，低的也能增产两倍左右。三连环耕作制的具体作法是：
      （一）在冬季进行垦复，包括修枝和除蚂蚁窝。由于此时林木正在休眠，垦复时如损伤了侧根和修枝时有切口，也不会出现树木枯萎的现象。冬天蚂蚁群聚窝内，便于根除。修枝主要是对结实树木修剪脚枝和病枝，避免树木浪费养分和遭病。
      （二）在第二年春天进行中耕培蔸。把垦复时挖的大块土胚打碎，成为直径五、六寸的土团，让土壤继续风化；把草根翻上来晒死。中耕的同时要对茶蔸进行培土，对蔸周围还用细土培成“乌龟背”形，这样能增强抗旱力。
      （三）间作杂粮。中耕的次年开始间作杂粮，春天仔细进行一次碎土，把草根耙出来烧掉，同时全面再翻耕一次然后播种。
    由斯社油茶林的生产并没有到顶。现在是十年垦一次，只间作一年杂粮。可以缩短到四——五年垦一次，或者长期间作杂粮。
