    In a Hapless City - Detroit
    Here, people see the children who are "now drinking plain water," and the troubled housewives who "don't know how they can manage to hold on for longer." The men seem unable to overcome the awkward feeling of being at home during the workday.
		　—Report by American journalist Joseph Alsop—
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th: New York dispatch: The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by Joseph Alsop from Detroit on the 17th, describing the plight of unemployed workers in the Detroit automobile industry.
    This Alsop recently visited the "United Automobile Workers Local 3" in Detroit and the worker residences of Dodge and Chrysler automobile companies. He wrote: "What you see among them is that this system, which they were taught to blindly trust, cruelly dismisses large numbers of industrial workers."
    He wrote: "On the morning I arrived, Pat Quinn, the president of the Dodge automobile company union, led a group of unemployed auto workers to the state capital, Lansing, to hold a protest march. So, all activities were temporarily concentrated in the small office of the union's vice president, Big Pete Triskie. Triskie is a tall, yellow-faced, grumpy man. Before I had time to introduce myself, Richard—a young man who had been a crane operator for Dodge for ten years—hesitantly came in and asked Big Pete if he knew "any place that was hiring?" Big Pete said sharply, "Kid, you won't find a job in this hapless city." Richard nodded glumly, as if it was the answer he expected." Alsop went on to point out that this was a "painful answer" for Richard. Richard's father "worked for the Dodge factory for twenty-five years," and in the past, both father and son worked, and after his father's death, "Richard alone was doing quite well," but now Richard's entire income depends on receiving unemployment benefits every week.
    Alsop continued: "Following Richard came the strong old Charles, a fifteen-year welder, 'doing the final process work in the company, except for one year,' then came the slow-talking Southerner, Herman,"... "All morning long, people came in one after another, all asking the same main question."
    Alsop pointed out that these workers, "after continuously doing the same job for nine, ten, or eleven years, suddenly had their income cut in half. Like most of the other tens of thousands of unemployed auto workers in Detroit, everyone can now only receive nine to thirteen weeks of unemployment benefits, and then they will have no income. Everyone has regular expenses to pay, and they are finding it difficult to pay these expenses even now...." "Visiting door-to-door along the gray streets, the situation is the same, only more cruel and heartbreaking, because people really see the precarious furniture, washing machines, and housing. People see the children who are "now drinking plain water," and the troubled housewives who "don't know how they can manage to hold on for longer." The men seem unable to overcome the awkward feeling of being at home during the workday."
    Alsop finally pointed out that if these people cannot find work by the end of the relief period, their entire lives will become miserable. He wrote: "Remember, they represent hundreds of thousands of unemployed industrial workers in dozens of cities other than Detroit."

### 在一个倒霉的城市——底特律

    在一个倒霉的城市——底特律
    这里，人们看到那些“现在在喝白开水”的孩子们，看到那些“不知道怎样能够设法维持得长久一些”的为难的主妇们。男人们看来不能克服工作日耽到家里的别扭心里。		　——美国记者约·艾尔索普的报道——
    新华社18日讯　纽约消息：“纽约先驱论坛报”17日发表了约瑟夫·艾尔索普从底特律发出的一篇文章，叙述了底特律汽车工业失业工人的困苦情况。
    这位艾尔索普最近刚刚访问过底特律“联合汽车工人工会第三分会”以及道奇和克莱斯勒汽车公司的工人住宅。他写道：“你在他们当中看见的是，他们被教导要盲目地信任的这个制度残酷地解雇大批的产业工人”。
    他写道：“在我到那里去的那个早上，道奇汽车公司工会主席帕特·奎恩带领一批失业汽车工人前往州首府兰星举行抗议游行去了。所以一切活动暂时都集中到工会副主席大佩特·特利斯基的小办公室里来了。特利斯基是一个身材高大、黄脸、脾气暴躁的人。我还没有来得及作自我介绍，理查德——一个已经替道奇汽车公司做了十年起重机驾驶员而还很年轻的小伙子——颇为犹豫地走进来问大佩特，他是否知道“有什么地方要雇人？”大佩特尖刻地说，“孩子，你在这个倒霉的城里是找不到工作的”。理查德闷闷不乐地点点头，好像这是他意料中的回答。”艾尔索普接着指出，但是，这对理查德说来是一个“难受的回答”。理查德的父亲“为道奇汽车工厂干了二十五年”，过去父子两人都做工，在他父亲去世以后，“理查德一个人也还过得很不错”，但是，现在理查德的全部收入就只能靠每星期领失业救济金了。
    艾尔索普接着写道：“继理查德之后而来的是强壮的老查尔斯，他是一个十五年的电焊工，‘在公司里作最后一道工序的工作，只有一年除外’，接着又来了说话慢吞吞的南方佬赫尔曼，”……“整个上午，人们一个接着一个进来的，所有来的人都提出一个相同的主要问题。”
    艾尔索普指出，这些工人“在连续做了九年、十年或十一年的同一种工作以后，他们的收入突然减少了一半。像底特律的其他几万名失业汽车工人中的大多数人一样，现在大家都只能再领九个到十三个星期的失业救济金，到那时就将毫无收入了。大家都有定期的开支要付，而他们连现在都很难支付这些开支了。……”“沿着灰色的街道挨门拜访，情况也是一样的，只是情况更加残酷和更令人痛心，因为人们真正看到那些朝不保夕的家具、洗衣机和住房。人们看到那些“现在在喝白开水”的孩子们，看到那些“不知道怎样能够设法维持得长久一些”的为难的主妇们。男人们看来不能克服工作日耽在家里的别扭心理。
    艾尔索普最后指出，如果在救济期结束时这些人还找不到工作的话，他们的整个生活将变得困苦不堪。他写道：“记住，他们是代表除了底特律以外的其他几十个城市内好几十万没有工作的产业工人的。”
