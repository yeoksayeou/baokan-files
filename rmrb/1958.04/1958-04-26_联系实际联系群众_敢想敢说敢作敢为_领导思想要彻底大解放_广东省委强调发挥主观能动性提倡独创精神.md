Guangzhou, April 25th (Our Newspaper) - The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee recently comprehensively reviewed and summarized the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, and believes that the Great Leap Forward movement in agricultural production and other tasks is developing vigorously in a deep and broad direction, pushing towards a more magnificent and grand new stage. This Great Leap Forward situation requires the leadership to keep up with it in a timely manner, which urgently requires a real and thorough liberation of leadership thinking.

The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee recently held a plenary session of the Provincial Party Committee (attended by secretaries of the prefectural party committees and responsible comrades of the province and cities), and spent four days specifically on the issue of ideological emancipation, conducting a relatively heated discussion. The comrades who attended the meeting unanimously agreed that in order to better implement the construction line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results," there must be an ideological emancipation. If the ideology is not liberated, and people's subjective understanding lags behind the objective reality, then it will not be possible to fully utilize subjective initiative, use objectively existing possibilities, and build socialism as much as possible, as quickly as possible, as well as possible, and as economically as possible.

	Ideological Liberation Generates Enthusiasm, Ideological Liberation Creates Miracles
The meeting listed many facts to illustrate that ideological emancipation is very necessary. Ideological emancipation generates enthusiasm and creates many miracles, completing in a short period of time what could not be done in the past few years or decades. Last winter and this spring, the province's farmers enthusiastically carried out farmland capital construction, repairing nearly 800 million cubic meters of earthwork for water conservancy, increasing and improving the irrigation area by more than 23 million mu, accumulating more than 15 billion dan of fertilizer, improving 12.4 million mu of soil, leveling more than 2 million mu of cultivated land, and planting 20 million mu of forests. These tasks increased several times compared with previous years, and were carried out after the autumn harvest, followed immediately by winter planting of 20 million mu, that is to say, they were completed in a concentrated manner within two or three months, which was unimaginable in the past. Grain production is another example: in the past five years, the province's grain production increased by only 5.5 billion jin, but from the current situation, it can increase by 5.5 billion jin in one year. The unparalleled labor enthusiasm of the province's farmers is also reflected in the great achievements made in spring plowing and rice transplanting. This year, Guangdong Province universally promoted dense planting (mostly in the specification of four by five), and the workload increased by more than doubled, but the rice transplanting was completed one solar term earlier. This is the result of tens of days and nights of concentrated rush planting by the vast number of farmers. For example, the rice transplanting time of the Duhui Commune in Xinhui County was twenty-seven days the year before last, thirty-three days last year, and only thirteen days this year. The peasants understand: striving to transplant one day earlier can bring one more harvest. In the past few months, the advanced things that have emerged in the province have been overwhelming. For example, the Hepu Special Zone has completely mechanized its transportation in eight days; Panyu County has successfully trial-produced biogas power generation, clinker-free cement, universal tractors, native cars, steamships, power pile drivers, and created and imitated more than 100 kinds of new agricultural tools in less than two months, and so on. All of these were things that they did not dare to think about, dare not do, and could not do in the past, but they have all been done this year. The meeting analyzed that the reason why miracles could be made and such great achievements could be made this year is that the leadership's thinking has begun to be liberated, and it can concentrate and reflect the advanced requirements of the masses. It can also see and grasp the emerging things that are in the budding state. In this way, all tasks appear to be particularly vigorous. The meeting also pointed out that despite the great changes in the work situation in the past few months, there are still many regions and many departments that appear to be much more backward when compared with advanced regions and advanced examples. The fundamental reason for the backwardness is that the leadership's thinking in these regions and departments has not been liberated, or has not been liberated enough, and they are still handling affairs according to routine. The situation is changing rapidly, but their thinking is still crawling. In the face of the surging tide of the masses, they show many concerns and are at a loss. From the comparison of the above two situations, it can be seen that it is the same situation and the same masses, but the work situation is completely different. This fully illustrates that the subjective initiative of the leadership plays a very important role here. Therefore, a great emancipation of leadership thinking is also very necessary.
	Eliminate Dogmatism, Empiricism, and Right-leaning Conservative Ideology
The Provincial Party Committee meeting believes that the so-called ideological emancipation is to liberate from the shackles of dogmatism and empiricism, to oppose Right-leaning conservative ideology, to liberate subjective initiative, to give full play to independent thinking and original spirit, and to better implement the socialist construction line. The meeting particularly emphasized the need to eliminate the Guangdong Party's internal empiricism, dogmatism and Right-leaning conservative thinking, believing that this is the main shackle hindering ideological emancipation. The dogmatic tendencies existing within the Guangdong Party are mainly manifested in the inability to learn from foreign experience based on China's specific conditions, regarding socialist construction as very mysterious and unattainable. Not every communist party member has a clear understanding of the general line of socialist construction formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Therefore, when conceiving of developing industry, they always think that it requires a lot of investment, high technology, and many years to build a factory. When conceiving of agricultural mechanization, they always feel that it is a distant future matter. In this way, it is impossible to give play to the pioneering spirit of the Party and the broad masses of cadres, which limits the play of subjective initiative. The harm of empiricism and conservative thinking is far more serious than dogmatism within the Guangdong Party, manifested in: many veteran cadres are limited by past revolutionary work experience in looking at problems, and do not understand that the productive forces after changing the relations of production can do things that our past experience has never had. Therefore, they lack the spirit of bold originality, stick to conventions, and remain complacent, making work lack vitality. People with such empiricist conservative ideas cannot have lofty ideals, high enthusiasm, and full vigor for socialist construction. Needless to say, all these ideas cannot meet the needs of great construction. Since the rectification campaign, a fire has been set to burn away some dogmatism, empiricism, and conservative thinking, and in the future, an ideological emancipation movement should be carried out within the Party to completely burn away the ideological shackles.

	Think Broadly and Freely, Work Boldly and Originally
If we want to achieve ideological emancipation, we must achieve two things: one is to connect with reality and connect with the masses. The other is to dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to do. The meeting believed that the so-called reality is the struggle for production and class struggle, that is, the instructions of the Party Central Committee on these struggles, and the implementation of the instructions by the broad masses and cadres. The broad masses are full of infinite wisdom and vitality. The masses dare to think and do things that leaders dare not think and dare not do. When leading cadres go deep into the masses, their thinking becomes clear and methods are found. This is our most profound experience in the past few years, especially in the past few months. Therefore, as long as we rely on the masses, ask the masses for advice, and maintain frequent contact with cadres at all levels, and carefully study the central government's policies and the instructions of higher authorities, we will definitely be able to liberate our own thinking and take a big leap forward. The meeting also pointed out that within the Guangdong Party, on the one hand, it is necessary to thoroughly oppose localism, on the other hand, as long as the party cadres stand on the position of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology," and for the sake of building socialism more quickly, they should be allowed to argue about different opinions, dare to think broadly and freely, praise all original actions and bold innovation spirit, and give warm help to comrades who make mistakes in their work. In this way, a lively environment can be created to further promote ideological emancipation.
	Conscientiously Study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's Works
The meeting particularly emphasized that conscientiously studying Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works is extremely important for improving the ideological level of all party cadres and helping cadres learn how to think independently. Because by studying Chairman Mao's works, we can not only learn specific instructions for current work, but more importantly, learn Chairman Mao's methods of observing and solving problems. The comrades who attended the meeting deeply felt that an important reason why the ideological level within the Guangdong Party organization has not improved quickly enough since liberation is that we have not studied Chairman Mao's works and instructions seriously enough. Now we must correct this phenomenon and decide to conscientiously launch a movement to study Chairman Mao's works within the province's Party.

	Transform the Leadership Methods of Party Committees to Adapt to the New Situation of the Great Leap Forward
The meeting also conducted specific discussions on how to transform the leadership methods of Party committees to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward situation, and stipulated the following methods:

	(1) Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions on leadership principles, and the leadership of Party committees must implement collective leadership with individual responsibility. Party committees at all levels can be led by the First Secretary, dividing the Standing Committee members or above into several work management aspects according to the front lines, and handling daily work according to the decisions of the Standing Committee meetings or the Secretariat meetings. Standing Committee meetings or Secretariat meetings should focus on studying the situation, exchanging opinions, and summarizing experience, and do not bring everything to the meetings for resolution.

	(2) Strengthen connection with reality and thoroughly change the style of being bureaucratic. The regulation that the main cadres of the provincial party committee go down to the grassroots for four months a year must be resolutely implemented. All kinds of business meetings should be held in advanced areas and advanced units as much as possible, and not in the location of the leading organs.

	(3) Strengthen ideological leadership and the work of summarizing experience. Meetings of leading organs at all levels should regularly discuss ideology, promote a climate of daring to think and speak, and also carry out comradely criticism of incorrect ideological behaviors. Party committees at all levels should pay attention to summarizing work experience and improving quality. Responsible cadres at all levels should personally participate in summarizing the work, personally write or personally revise it, and resolutely overcome the current phenomenon of low quality in summarizing experience.

	(4) Improve learning methods. The Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee should compile and print Chairman Mao's theory on socialist construction and speeches at various meetings into volumes and distribute them to cadres above the county party committee secretary for study. Change the past method of theoretical study for cadres, and decide that from the third quarter, cadres above the county party committee secretary will take turns to study for one month each year, separated from their work. The secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee will take turns participating in and leading the study. The method is to first study Chairman Mao's works, and refer to the necessary Marxist-Leninist classics. And achieve a combination of book learning, visits, and summarizing experience to improve the quality of learning.

	(5) Leading cadres should regularly write articles for party newspapers and theoretical publications and give reports to universities. This is a good way to force cadres to study problems and achieve both red and expert.

    联系实际联系群众　敢想敢说敢作敢为
    领导思想要彻底大解放
    广东省委强调发挥主观能动性提倡独创精神
    本报广州25日电　中共广东省委最近全面检查总结了生产大跃进的情况，认为：农业生产和其它各项工作的大跃进运动，正在猛烈地向深广方面发展，推向一个更加壮丽、更加宏伟的新阶段。这种大跃进的形势，需要领导能及时跟上去，这就迫切要求领导思想来一个真正彻底的大解放。
    中共广东省委最近召开的省委全体会议（有地委书记和省市有关负责同志参加），以四天时间，专门就思想大解放问题，进行了较热烈的讨论。与会的同志一致认为：为了更好地贯彻“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省”的建设路线，必须有一个思想大解放。如果思想不解放，人们的主观认识落后于客观实际，就不能充分发挥主观能动性，运用客观存在的可能性，尽量多、尽量快、尽量好、尽量省地建设社会主义。
    思想解放产生干劲  思想解放创造奇迹
    会议列举了许多事实，说明思想解放是十分必要的。思想解放才产生干劲，做出许多奇迹，在短时间内做完过去几年或几十年所做不到的事情。去冬今春全省农民热火朝天地进行农田基本建设，修水利近八亿多土方，增加与改善灌溉面积二千三百多万亩，积肥一百五十多亿担，改良土壤一千二百四十万亩，平整耕地二百多万亩，植林二千万亩，就是一个例子。这些工作，比往年增加几倍，并且是在秋收后，紧接着进行冬种二千万亩的同时进行的，也就是说，是集中在两三个月内完成了的，这在过去是根本不敢设想的。粮食生产又是一个例子：过去五年全省粮食增产不过五十五亿斤，从现在情况看来，今年一年就可以增产五十五亿斤。全省农民的无比的劳动热情，还表现在春耕插秧所取得的巨大成绩上面。今年广东省插秧普遍推行了密植（多数是四乘五的规格），工作量增加一倍以上，却提早一个节气插完了秧，这是广大农民数十天日夜突击抢插的结果。例如新会县都会社的插秧时间，前年二十七天，去年三十三天，今年只有十三天。农民懂得：争取早插一天，就能多一分收获。这几个月来，全省涌现的先进事物，更是应接不暇，例如：合浦专区八天内全部车子化；番禺县不到两个月，试制成功了沼气发电、无熟料水泥、万能拖拉机、土汽车、汽船、动力打桩机及创造仿造了一百多种新式农具，等等。所有这些，都是过去不敢想，不敢做，也是不可能做到的事情，今年却都做到了。会议分析说，今年所以能够做出奇迹，取得这样大的成绩，是由于领导思想已开始解放，能够集中与反映群众的先进要求，对于处于萌芽状态的新生事物也看得见，抓得起。这样一来，各项工作就显得特别的生气勃勃。会议同时指出：尽管近几个月来的工作面貌有了很大的改变，但是，仍然有不少地区和不少部门，如果与先进地区和先进事例比较起来，则显得落后得多。落后的根本原因，是这些地区和部门的领导思想还没有解放，或解放得很不够，仍按常规办事，形势一日千里，而他们的思想却在爬行，他们在群众的澎湃汹涌的热潮面前，表现顾虑重重，束手无策。从上面两种情况的对比可以看出，是同样的形势，同样的群众，而工作局面则完全两样。这就充分说明了：领导的主观能动性在这里起了十分重要的作用。因此，领导思想来一个大解放，也就是十分必要的了。排除教条主义、经验主义和右倾保守思想
    省委会议认为：所谓思想解放，就是要从教条主义和经验主义的束缚下解出来，就是要反对右倾保守思想，就是要解放主观能动性，充分发挥独立思考和独创精神，更好地执行社会主义建设路线。会议特别强调必须排除广东党内经验主义、教条主义和右倾保守思想，认为这是阻碍思想解放的主要桎梏。广东党内存在的教条主义倾向，主要表现在不善于根据中国的具体情况去学习外国经验，把社会主义建设看得很神秘，高不可攀，而对党中央和毛主席规定的社会主义建设的总路线，并不是每一个共产党员都认识得很清楚，因此，一设想搞工业，就是要很多的投资、要很高的技术、要多少年才能建成的工厂；一设想农业的机械化，总觉得那是遥远的将来的事。这样就不可能发挥党和广大干部的首创精神，限制了主观能动性的发挥。经验主义和保守思想的危害在广东党内远比教条主义严重，表现在：不少老干部局限过去的革命工作经验去看问题，不懂得改变了生产关系后的生产力所能办到的事情，是我们过去的经验所从来没有的，因此就缺乏大胆独创的精神，墨守陈规，故步自封，使工作缺乏朝气。具有这样的经验主义保守思想的人，对社会主义建设就不可能有远大的理想、高度的热情和十足的干劲。所有这些思想，不消说是不可能适应大建设的需要的。整风以来，曾经放了一把火，开始烧掉一些教条主义经验主义和保守思想，今后还要在党内开展思想解放运动，彻底把思想上的束缚烧掉。
    海阔天空地想问题  大胆独创地做工作
    如要达到思想解放，必须要做到两条：一是联系实际，联系群众。一是敢想敢说敢作敢为。会议认为：所谓实际，就是生产斗争和阶级斗争，就是党中央对这些斗争的指示，广大群众和干部对指示的执行情况。广大群众中蕴藏着无穷的智慧和生命力，领导者所不敢想、不敢做的事情，群众都敢想敢做。领导干部深入到群众中去，思想就豁然开朗了，办法也就有了。这是我们几年来，特别是近几个月来最深刻的体验。因此，只要我们依靠群众，请教群众，并和各级干部取得经常的联系，很好地研究中央的方针政策和上级的指示，就一定能够使自己的思想解放出来，就可以大大跃进一步。会议还指出：在广东党内，一方面要彻底反对地方主义，另一方面，在党的干部只要是站在“兴无灭资”的立场上，为着更快地建成社会主义，就应当允许对不同意见的争论，敢于海阔天空地想问题，赞许一切独创行动和大胆革新的精神，对在工作中犯错误的同志给予热情的帮助。这样就能创造出生动活泼的环境，进一步推动思想解放。认真学习马列主义和
      毛主席著作
    会议特别强调说，认真地学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，对提高全党干部的思想水平，帮助干部学会怎样独立思考，是极为重要的。因为通过学习毛主席的著作，不仅可以学到对当前工作的具体指示，更重要的是学到毛主席观察和解决问题的方法。与会的同志都深深觉得：解放以来，广东党组织内思想水平提高不够快的一个重要原因，是我们对毛主席的著作、指示，学习得不够认真。现在必须纠正这种现象，决定在全省党内认真展开学习毛主席的著作的运动。
    改造党委领导方法  适应大跃进新形势
    会议还对如何改造党委的领导方法，以适应大跃进形势的需要问题，进行了具体的讨论，并规定了以下几条办法：
      （1）坚决执行毛主席关于领导原则的指示，党委的领导必须实行集体领导，又有分工负责。各级党委均可以主管书记为首，把常委或委员以上的负责人，按战线分成几个工作主管方面，根据常委会议或书记处会议的决定，处理日常工作。常委会议或书记会议着重研究情况，交换意见，总结经验，不要事事都提到会议上去解决。
      （2）加强联系实际，彻底改变机关化的作风。省委机关各单位主要干部一年下去四个月的规定要坚决执行。各种业务会议都要尽量到先进地区、先进单位去开，不要在领导机关所在地开。
      （3）加强思想领导与总结经验的工作。各级领导机关的会议，要定期谈思想，要提倡敢想敢讲的风气，也要对不正确的思想行为开展同志式的批评。各级党委要注意总结工作经验，提高质量。总结工作各级负责干部要亲自参加，亲自写或亲自改，坚决克服目前经验总结质量不高的现象。
      （4）改善学习方法。由省委宣传部把毛主席关于社会主义建设的理论，与在各次会议的讲话编印成册，发给县委书记以上干部学习。改变过去干部理论学习的方法，决定从第三季度起，县委书记以上干部轮流每人每年脱离工作学习一个月，由省委书记轮流参加学习领导。方法是先研究毛主席的著作，参考必要的马列主义的经典著作。并且做到书本学习与参观、总结经验相结合，提高学习的质量。
      （5）领导干部要经常为党报与理论刊物写文章，到大专学校作报告，这是迫使干部钻研问题，做到又红又专的一个好办法。
