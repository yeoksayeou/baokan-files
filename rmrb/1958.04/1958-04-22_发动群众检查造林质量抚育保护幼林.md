    Mobilize the Masses to Inspect Afforestation Quality, Nurture and Protect Young Trees
    (Reported by this newspaper) The nationwide spring tree planting and afforestation campaign has achieved astonishing results, with newly planted forests exceeding the total afforestation in the past eight years. Currently, the large-scale tree planting and afforestation campaign continues to develop, and some regions have launched inspection and evaluation movements.
    According to incomplete statistics from twenty-two provinces, by mid-April, the spring afforestation area had reached more than 270 million mu, exceeding the annual afforestation plan by more than three times and accounting for 140% of the total in the past eight years. In addition, the number of trees planted around houses and villages across the country reached over 10.78 billion, more than five times the original plan. A total of 304 counties across the country have completed the first step of their respective greening plans, that is, completed the task of tree planting and afforestation.
    The provinces with the fastest progress, such as Guizhou, Anhui, and Sichuan, have all reached 30 to 40 million mu of spring afforestation area. Among them, Guizhou Province has afforested 41.88 million mu, with an average of 2.5 mu afforested per person. In the north, Gansu Province has afforested more than 22 million mu, and Hebei Province has recently planted more than 21 million mu of forests in one month.
    Now that the spring sowing is intensive, the afforestation campaign is turning to the inspection and evaluation stage. Liuan and Anqing Special Districts in Anhui Province have organized inspections from bottom to top and from top to bottom. The inspection teams carry tools, and while inspecting, they carry out replanting, soil cultivation, and watering. In the three northeastern provinces, spring sowing is later, and the tree planting and afforestation campaign is unfolding on a large scale. Other regions are also preparing to continue afforestation and tree planting in the gaps between spring plowing and sowing.
    The Ministry of Forestry pointed out that the general quality of tree planting this year is good, but in some individual areas, some trees were planted roughly, which will affect the survival rate. Due to insufficient tree species, some places are sparsely planted, not reaching the requirement of 400 to 800 trees per mu. All localities must emphasize the quality of planting and the density of afforestation through inspection, and try to remedy the situation in the gaps between spring plowing and sowing; and implement the policy of guaranteeing planting and survival, and organize the masses to maintain the trees. Strive to plant one tree and make it live, and afforest one mu and make it successful.

    发动群众检查造林质量抚育保护幼林
    本报讯　全国春季植树造林运动取得了惊人的成绩，新造的林超过过去八年造林的总和。现在，大规模植树造林运动还在继续发展，部分地区已掀起检查评比运动。
    据二十二省不完全的统计，到4月中旬，春季造林面积已达二亿七千多万亩，超过今年全年造林计划三倍多，为过去八年总和的140％。另外，全国四旁植树也达一百零七亿八千多万株，为原计划的五倍多。全国已经有三百零四个县完成了各自所订绿化规划的第一步，即完成了植树造林的任务。
    进展最快的贵州、安徽、四川等省，春季造林面积都已达三千万到四千万亩。其中贵州省造林达四千一百八十八万亩，平均每人造林二点五亩。北方的甘肃省造林已达二千二百多万亩，河北省最近一月已造成片林二千一百多万亩。
    现在春播紧张，造林运动正转向检查评比阶段。安徽省六安、安庆等专区组织了从下自上和从上自下两方面的检查。检查组携带着工具，一面检查，一面就进行补栽、培土、浇水等工作。东北三省春播较迟，植树造林运动正大规模展开。其他地区还准备在春耕播种空隙中继续造林植树。
    林业部指出：今年植树一般质量好，但也有个别地区部分树种得粗糙，将影响成活率。由于树种不足，有些地方种得稀，没有达到每亩四百到八百株的要求。各地须通过检查强调种树的质量和造林的密度，在春耕播种的空隙中设法补救；并贯彻包栽包活，组织群众养护。争取种一株活一株、造一亩成一亩。
