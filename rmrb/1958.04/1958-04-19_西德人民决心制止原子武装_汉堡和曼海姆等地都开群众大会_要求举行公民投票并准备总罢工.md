Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 18th Dispatch: On the 7th at 5 p.m., a protest rally with 150,000 participants was held in Hamburg, West Germany's largest city, against the Bonn government's atomic rearmament policy. The rally was initiated by the city's "Committee Against Atomic Death." At the same time, all buses, trolleybuses, and subway trains in the city stopped running for one hour in response to a call from the transport workers' union.

Carrying banners and flags, crowds of demonstrators marched from all corners of the city to the central square. Social Democratic and Free Democratic Party officials from the city government all attended the rally.

Mayor Brauer (Social Democrat) announced to the assembly that the City of Hamburg was ready to hold a referendum on the issue of West German atomic armament. A representative of the West German Trade Union Federation said at the meeting that if the Bonn government refuses to change its decision on atomic armament, the Trade Union Federation will take strike measures.

Residents of many other cities in West Germany have also held protest rallies. Mannheim, an industrial city in southwestern West Germany, held a rally on the 16th with 50,000 participants, the largest mass gathering in the city since the war. The conference finally adopted a resolution demanding that the Bonn Federal Parliament and government rescind the resolution on atomic armament.

On the same day, 13,000 people in Bremen held a passionate protest rally against Adenauer's atomic war plan.

At an anti-atomic armament rally held in Duisburg in the Ruhr area on the 16th, Helmut Schmidt, a Social Democratic member of the Federal Parliament, advocated a general strike to oppose atomic armament. He said, "If necessary, we will not hesitate to paralyze the entire economy of the Federal Republic for twenty-four hours." He stressed that only when the working class becomes the driving force of the movement can atomic armament be stopped.

Following the cities of Frankfurt and Wiesbaden, the city council of Mülheim, an important city in the Ruhr area, recently passed a resolution to hold a referendum on the issue of atomic armament throughout the city.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th Telegram: While West German Chancellor Adenauer is in London holding talks with the British government, a group of British residents participating in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament today began a continuous 24-hour vigil outside the West German Embassy, protesting the arming of West German troops with nuclear weapons. A spokesman for the protesters said that they opposed NATO handing over missiles with nuclear warheads to the West German army.

    西德人民决心制止原子武装
    汉堡和曼海姆等地都开群众大会
    要求举行公民投票并准备总罢工
    据新华社18日讯　波恩消息：7日下午五时，西德最大城市汉堡举行了有十五万人参加的抗议大会，反对波恩政府的原子备战政策。大会是由该市“反对原子死亡”委员会发起的。在同一时间内，全市公共汽车、无轨电车和地下电车都响应运输工会的号召停驶一小时。
    示威群众举着标语和旗帜，成群结队从市内各个角落走向市中心区的广场。市政府官员中的社会民主党人和自由民主党人全都出席了大会。
    市长布劳尔（社会民主党）向大会宣布，汉堡市准备就西德原子武装问题举行一次公民投票。西德工会联合会的代表在会上讲话说，如果波恩政府不肯改变关于原子武装的决定，工会联合会将采取罢工措施。
    西德其他许多城市居民也纷纷举行抗议大会。西德西南部的工业城市曼海姆在16日举行了有五万人参加的大会，这是这个城市里战后规模最大的一次群众集会。大会最后通过一项决议，要求波恩联邦议院和政府撤销关于原子武装的决议。
    同一天，不来梅市群众一万三千人也举行了一次情绪激昂的抗议大会，反对阿登纳的原子战争计划。
    在鲁尔区杜伊斯堡市16日举行的一次抗议集会上，联邦议院社会民主党议员赫尔穆特·施密特主张举行总罢工来反对原子武装。他说，“如果必要的话，我们将毫不犹豫地让联邦共和国的整个经济瘫痪二十四小时。”他强调说，只有工人阶级成为运动的动力，才能制止原子武装。
    继法兰克福和威斯巴登两城市之后，鲁尔区重要城市米耳海姆的市议会也在最近通过了在全市范围内就原子武装问题举行公民投票的决议。
    新华社伦敦17日电　当西德总理阿登纳在伦敦和英国政府进行会谈时，一批参加争取核裁军运动的英国居民今天在西德大使馆门外开始了日夜二十四小时不停的示威，抗议用核武器武装西德的军队。这批示威者的发言人说，他们反对北大西洋集团把装有核弹头的火箭交给西德军队。
