Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, 17th: Chilean President Carlos Ibáñez abruptly cancelled his planned state visit to the United States on the 16th. This visit was originally scheduled for April 29th.

According to the Associated Press, senior Chilean government officials revealed that the cancellation of this visit was due to Chile's anger at the recent US government's preparation to restore import tariffs on copper. Chile believes that this action by the United States is a "stab in the back" to Chile.

Most of Chile's main export, copper, is exported to the United States. Recently, the United States has repeatedly lowered the price of copper, which has severely affected the Chilean economy. Chilean public opinion has become extremely dissatisfied with the United States.

    智利总统取消访美
    不满美国经济歧视
    新华社17日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利总统卡洛斯·伊巴?斯16日突然取消了他的到美国去进行国事访问的计划。这次访问原定于4月29日进行。
    据美联社报道，智利高级政府人士透露，取消这次访问是因为智利对于美国政府最近准备恢复铜的进口税的做法感到愤怒，智利认为美国这一行动是对智利的“背上的一刀”。
    智利主要出口品铜大部分是向美国输出的。最近以来，由于美国一再压低铜的价格，使智利经济受到严重影响，智利舆论对美国已经极为不满。
