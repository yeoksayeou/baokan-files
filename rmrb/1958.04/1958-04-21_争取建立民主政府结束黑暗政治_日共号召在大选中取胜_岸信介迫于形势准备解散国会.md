Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th dispatch: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued an appeal on the 18th, calling on the Japanese people to take immediate action to strive for victory in the upcoming general election.

The appeal calls on all Japanese people, mainly workers and farmers, to concentrate their efforts in the general election struggle to overthrow the Shinsuke Kishi government, in order to end Japan's current dark politics. The Japanese Communist Party resolutely stated that it will do its utmost in the general election struggle to increase the number of seats held by the JCP in the Diet and for the victory of democratic forces, to strive for the establishment of a democratic government, to change the political direction of Japan to embark on a bright path of independence, peace, and prosperity, to prevent atomic war, and to strive for the peaceful coexistence of all countries in the world.

The appeal pointed out that in order to realize the urgent wishes of all Japanese people, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party must join hands to establish a united front including all democratic forces. At the same time, it is necessary to first strengthen the strength of the vanguard of the working class—the Japanese Communist Party—and its seats in the Diet.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party has decided to submit a motion of no confidence in the Shinsuke Kishi cabinet to the House of Representatives of the Diet on April 24. Shinsuke Kishi told reporters today that if the Japanese Socialist Party submits a motion of no confidence in his cabinet to the Diet on schedule, he is prepared to dissolve the Diet on April 25, when the House of Representatives discusses the proposal.

Since its formation in February of last year, the Kishi Shinsuke cabinet has stepped up the implementation of a pro-American policy and the revival of Japanese militarism. Its reactionary policy violates the national interests of Japan. The Japanese public, as well as the Japanese Socialist Party and the Communist Party, have repeatedly demanded the early dissolution of the Diet and the holding of new general elections. This situation has forced the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to consider this issue.

    争取建立民主政府结束黑暗政治
    日共号召在大选中取胜
    岸信介迫于形势准备解散国会
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会在18日发表呼吁书，号召日本人民为争取在即将来临的大选中取得胜利，立即开始行动。
    呼吁书号召以工人和农民为主的全体日本人民在大选斗争中，集中力量打倒岸信介政府，以争取结束日本现在的黑暗政治。日本共产党坚决表示，它将在大选斗争中竭尽全力，为增加日共在国会中的议席和民主力量的胜利，为争取建立民主政府，转变日本的政治方向，以走上独立、和平、繁荣的光明道路，为阻止原子战争，实现世界各国的和平共处而奋斗。
    呼吁书指出，为了实现全体日本人民这样迫切的愿望，共产党和社会党必须携起手来建立包括所有民主力量的统一战线。同时，必须先加强工人阶级的先锋队——日本共产党的力量和它在国会内的议席。
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本社会党已经决定在4月24日向国会众议院提出不信任岸信介内阁案。岸信介今天对新闻记者表示，如果日本社会党按期向国会对他的内阁提出不信任案，他就准备在众议院讨论这个提案的4月25日解散国会。
    岸信介内阁自去年2月组成以来，加紧执行亲美和复活日本军国主义的政策。它的这种反动政策违反了日本的民族利益。日本公众以及日本社会党和共产党都一再要求早日解散国会，重新举行大选。这种形势迫使执政的自由民主党不得不考虑这个问题。
