    "Everyone Receiving Subsidies" Is Outdated
    Our secondary vocational school students have always enjoyed full people's subsidy treatment. As soon as each student enters the school, the state gives them eleven yuan. In the past, it was precisely because of the people's subsidy that the vast number of workers' and peasants' children had the opportunity to enroll. However, the people's living standards have generally improved, and it is no longer reasonable to continue implementing this "everyone receiving subsidies" system. Judging from the situation in our school, the living standards of many students are higher than those of ordinary workers. Some students have watches and leather shoes, and some students have dozens of yuan deposited in the bank. Some students spend extravagantly because they have a lot of pocket money, which has created a very bad influence among the masses.
    Our school currently has about 1,500 students, and the state allocates more than 180,000 yuan in subsidies to students every year, which is a considerable expenditure. I suggest canceling the subsidies for secondary vocational schools. For the food expenses of some students with financial difficulties, other methods can be adopted to solve them.

### “人人享受助学金”过时了

    “人人享受助学金”过时了
    我们中等专业学校的学生，向来是全部享受人民助学金待遇的。每个学生一进校门，国家就给他们十一元，过去，正是由于人民助学金，才使得广大工农子弟得到入学的机会。但是，目前人民的生活水平已经普遍提高，再继续实行这种“人人享受助学金”的制度就不合理了。从我校的情况来看，许多同学的生活水平比一般工人还高，有些同学有手表，皮鞋，有些同学还有几十元钱存在银行里。有些同学由于手头零钱多，就大吃大喝，在群众中造成了极坏的影响。
    我校现有同学一千五百名左右，国家每年要拨给同学十八万多元助学金，这笔开支是相当大的。我建议取消中等专业学校的助学金。对一部分生活困难的同学的伙食费，可采取其他办法加以解决。
