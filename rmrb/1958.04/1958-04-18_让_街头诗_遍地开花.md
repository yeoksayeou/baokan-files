    Let "Street Poetry" Bloom Everywhere
    Today we have compiled a special page on "Street Poetry" with the aim of introducing this short and pithy poetic form to everyone, hoping that it will bloom everywhere in the streets of cities and towns across the motherland, serving socialist construction.
    This is one of the convenient tools for carrying out propaganda and education among the masses. Let's imagine: If there are "Street Poetry" gardens at the entrances of offices, factories, agricultural cooperatives, in company barracks, on construction sites, at school gates, on the walls of cultural centers and stations, in parks, and on bustling streets, and if there are some places where the masses write and sing their own poems, with the relevant units providing assistance and leadership, this will surely add strength to the promotion of our socialist great leap forward and to the socialist education of the people. Jiang Zongyuan's transportation tools are all mobilized to deliver fertilizer to the countryside like a race, supporting the agricultural great leap forward and achieving the forty articles ahead of schedule. Female comrades are not simple. They are drumming up energy to carry burdens, with a spirit no less than that of men. "You are young, are you afraid you can't carry too much?" "I'm going to the countryside soon, so I'm practicing now." Those who are too old to carry can deliver tea and water to comfort them. If there are not enough tools, there is a way: basins and iron buckets are put to use. You pass it to me, and I hand it to her; one person carries one bucket, and there is strength in numbers.

### 让“街头诗”遍地开花

    让“街头诗”遍地开花
    今天我们编了一个“街头诗”的专页，目的是向大家介绍这种短小精悍的诗体，希望它在祖国城市和乡镇的街头遍地开花，为社会主义建设服务。
    这是向群众进行宣传教育的轻便工具之一。不妨设想一下：如果在机关、工厂、农业社的大门口，在连队的营房里，在工地上，在学校门口，在文化馆、文化站的照壁上，在公园里，在热闹的街头，出现一块块“街头诗”的园地，有一些群众自写自唱的处所，由有关单位加以帮助和领导，这对宣传我们的社会主义生产大跃进，对人民群众的社会主义教育，该是能增加一分力量的。姜宗元运输工具齐出动，送肥下乡如赛跑，支援农业大跃进，提前实现四十条。女同志，不简单。鼓起干劲来挑担，气概不减男子汉。“你的年纪轻，挑多怕不行？”“不久要下乡，先来练练劲。”年纪太大不能挑，送茶送水来慰劳。工具不够有办法，脸盆铁桶派用场。你传给我，我递给她；一人提一桶，人多力量大。
