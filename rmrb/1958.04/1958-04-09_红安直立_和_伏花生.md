Excellent Varieties

    “Hong’an Upright” is a type of superior peanut variety. The advantages of this variety are: 1. Strong reproductive ability and high yield. Its branching and fruiting rates both exceed those of general varieties. The average number of fruiting branches reaches five to six, with generally eighty to one hundred peanuts per nest, and some having more than two hundred. 2. The growing period is more than ten days shorter than that of prostrate varieties, maturing in about one hundred and forty to one hundred and fifty days. This reduces the threat of autumn drought and makes the yield relatively stable. 3. Compact branching, suitable for dense planting, concentrated fruiting, and convenient harvesting. Hong'an County has basically adopted this variety.

    The Shandong “Fu Peanut” is also an excellent peanut variety. This variety was selected from local "Dun" peanuts by Left Qiaosheng, an old lady from Liangjia Village, Fushan County, Shandong. This peanut has a very short growing period, maturing in only one hundred to one hundred and ten days, more than a month earlier than general varieties. It can be rotated with winter wheat, allowing for two crops a year. This variety of peanut has thin shells and full kernels, with a kernel yield 10%-20% higher than general varieties. Moreover, the plant shape is upright and compact, suitable for dense planting.

    The “One-Nest Monkey” peanut in Laiyang, Huimin, Linyi, Liaocheng, and other areas of Shandong Province and some areas of Hebei Province, the "Che Douzi" peanut in Nanchong County, Sichuan, the "Upright Peanut" in Henan, the "Lion Head Stand" peanut in Guangdong, and the "Robber Peanut" in Jiangxi are also excellent varieties favored by the masses. These peanuts generally have excellent characteristics such as high yield, high kernel yield, and short growing period.

专栏：优良品种

    “红安直立”和“伏花生”
    “红安直立”是花生良种中的一种。这个品种的优点是：1、生殖力强，产量较高。分枝及结果率都超过一般品种，结果枝数平均达五到六个，每窝结果一般有八十到一百个，多的有二百多个。2，生育期较蔓生种短十多天，约一百四十到一百五十天成熟，可减少秋旱的威胁，产量比较稳定。3、分枝紧凑，宜于密植，结果集中，收获方便。红安县基本上都采用了这个品种。
    山东“伏花生”也是花生中的一个优良品种。这个品种是山东福山县两甲庄村左乔生老大娘由当地墩花生内选育出来的。这种花生，生育期很短，仅一百到一百一十天就能成熟，比一般品种早熟一个多月，可以和冬小麦轮作，实行一年二熟。这个品种的花生皮壳薄，籽仁饱满，出仁率较一般品种多10％—20％，而且株形直立紧凑，适于密植。
    山东莱阳、惠民、临沂、聊城等专区和河北省一些地区的“一窝猴”花生，四川南充县的“扯兜子”花生，河南“直立种花生”，广东的“狮头企”花生，江西的“强盗花生”等，也都是群众喜欢的优良品种。这些花生一般都具有产量高、出仁率高、生长期短等优良特性。
