Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 4th. A military parade and a mass rally of hundreds of thousands of people were held today in Budapest's Dózsa György Square, the capital of Hungary, to celebrate the 13th anniversary of Hungary's liberation.
　　At 10 a.m., the Hungarian Minister of Defense, Révész, inspected the garrison troops of the capital and delivered a speech celebrating the festival.
　　Then, the march-past began. Infantry, workers' militia, artillery, and tank units passed in front of the reviewing stand in the square. Jet planes swept rapidly over the square. The various arms of the military received warm applause from the people.
　　Present on the podium to review the troops were the leaders of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the state, as well as personnel from the Soviet Communist Party and government delegation.
　　After the review, the people gathered around the square and the nearby streets surged towards the front of the podium. Then, the mass rally began.
　　The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Kadar, and the head of the Soviet Communist Party and government delegation, Khrushchev, spoke at the rally.
　　Kadar said that April 4th proves with indestructible force that Hungary's national independence, social progress, and Hungarian-Soviet friendship are inextricably linked. Thanks to the help of the Soviet Union, the Hungarian people have become independent and free people, and Hungary has become an industrially developed country.
　　Kadar said that the mutual assistance of countries in the socialist camp embodies the true spirit of proletarian internationalism. We Hungarians experienced the strength of this internationalism precisely during the difficult days of the 1956 counter-revolutionary rebellion.
　　Kadar emphasized that socialist thought has taken deep root in our country. Our Party has purged the traitors and corrected past mistakes, and is therefore stronger than before. It is united with the masses and leads the people in building socialism. The facts after the crushing of the counter-revolutionary rebellion exposed the enemy's slander that the Hungarian people would oppose the Communist Party and reject socialism. Kadar said that all attempts by the enemy to split Hungary from the socialist family have completely failed.
　　Kadar said that the Hungarian people unanimously and resolutely protest against equipping German militarists with atomic weapons. We reiterate that as long as the aggressive North Atlantic Alliance exists, we will faithfully fulfill the tasks undertaken under the Warsaw Treaty and the responsibilities of mutual assistance among socialist countries, because this assistance is an effective means of preventing the revival of German militarism.
　　In his speech, Khrushchev pointed out that the achievements of Hungary since its liberation were obtained under extremely difficult conditions and in the face of enemy sabotage. Khrushchev continued that the riots organized by foreign countries in Hungary in the autumn of 1956 caused no small loss to Hungary, but this certainly cannot prevent, and will not prevent, the Hungarian People's Republic from continuing to advance along the road of socialist construction. The rapid return of the situation in Hungary to normal most vividly illustrates that once a country has embarked on the road of socialism, it cannot be pulled backwards, and it also illustrates that the unity and fraternal mutual assistance of the countries in the socialist camp is a great force.
　　Speaking of the international situation, Khrushchev said that U.S. President Eisenhower said at a press conference a few days ago that the Soviet Union's measures to declare a unilateral cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests could not be "taken seriously." He said that this action was "purely propaganda." Khrushchev said that Eisenhower's statement disappointed and saddened people all over the world.
　　Khrushchev said, I would like to declare at this gathering of thousands of Hungarian working people: If Mr. Eisenhower really thinks that our cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests is propaganda, then why don't he and other Western government officials also engage in the same propaganda and stop testing nuclear weapons?
　　Khrushchev said that we believe that the cessation of nuclear weapon tests is the first step towards complete disarmament and the establishment of conditions to ensure world peace, and it is the path to ensuring peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the two systems.
　　Khrushchev concluded by saying that our main task is to consolidate peace. The socialist camp is a bastion of peace. We are aware of the great historical task entrusted to the socialist countries, and we will continue to firmly follow the path of socialism together in the future.
　　The speeches of Kadar and Khrushchev were constantly met with applause and cheers from the audience.
　　The mass rally ended at 2 p.m.

    布达佩斯几十万人集会庆祝国庆
    卡达尔说社会主义在匈牙利已生根
    赫鲁晓夫强调兄弟国家团结力量大
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　匈牙利首都布达佩斯的多若·捷尔吉广场上今天举行了阅兵和数十万人参加的群众集会，庆祝匈牙利解放十三周年。
    上午十时，匈牙利国防部长雷维斯检阅了首都的卫戍部队，并且发表了庆祝节日的演说。
    接着，分列式开始。步兵、工人自卫队、炮兵和坦克部队先后从广场上的检阅台前面经过。喷气式飞机急速地从广场上空掠过。接受检阅的各兵种部队受到了人们的热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    在主席台上检阅部队的有匈牙利社会主义工人党和国家的领导人，苏联共产党和政府代表团人员。
    检阅毕，聚集在广场四周和附近街道的人们涌到了主席台的前面。接着，群众集会开始。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会第一书记卡达尔、苏联共产党和政府代表团团长赫鲁晓夫先后在集会上讲了话。
    卡达尔说，4月4日这一天以不可摧毁的力量证明，匈牙利的民族独立、社会进步同匈苏友谊是不可分割地联系着的。由于苏联的帮助，匈牙利人民成了独立自由的人民，匈牙利成了工业发达的国家。
    卡达尔说，社会主义阵营国家的互相援助体现了真正的无产阶级国际主义思想。我们匈牙利人正是在1956年反革命叛乱的苦难日子里体会到了这种国际主义力量。
    卡达尔强调说，社会主义思想已经在我国根深蒂固了。我们的党清洗了叛徒，纠正了过去的错误，因而比以前更加强大了。它同群众团结在一起，领导人民建设社会主义。反革命叛乱被粉碎以后的事实，揭穿了敌人的污蔑，他们硬说什么匈牙利人民会反对共产党，不要社会主义。卡达尔说，敌人想把匈牙利从社会主义大家庭中分裂出去的一切企图是彻头彻尾地破产了。
    卡达尔说，匈牙利人民一致坚决地抗议用原子武器装备德国军国主义者。我们重申，只要侵略性北大西洋联盟存在，我们就要忠实地履行根据华沙条约承担的任务，以及社会主义国家互相援助的责任，因为这种援助是防止德国军国主义复活的有效手段。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中指出，匈牙利解放以来的成就是在极端困难的条件下、在敌人进行破坏活动的情况下获得的。赫鲁晓夫继续说，1956年秋天外国在匈牙利组织的暴乱给匈牙利造成了不小损失，然而这当然不能阻止、而且也阻止不了匈牙利人民共和国沿着社会主义建设的道路继续前进。匈牙利情况的迅速恢复正常，最鲜明地说明了，一个国家既然已经走上了社会主义的道路，那是不能把它拉向后退的，同时还说明了，社会主义阵营各国的团结一致和兄弟互助是一种伟大的力量。
    在谈到国际形势的时候，赫鲁晓夫说，美国总统艾森豪威尔前几天在记者招待会上说，苏联关于宣布单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器的措施是不能“认真对待的”。他说这种行动“完全是宣传性质的”。赫鲁晓夫说，艾森豪威尔这个声明使得全世界人民感到失望和痛心。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我愿在匈牙利劳动人民这个成千成万人的集会上声明：假如艾森豪威尔先生真正认为我们停止原子武器和氢武器的试验是一种宣传，那么为什么他和西方的其他政府人士不也来进行同样的宣传，停止试验核武器呢？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为停止核武器试验是彻底裁军、建立保障世界和平的条件的第一步，是保障两个制度和平共处、和平竞赛的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，我们的主要任务是巩固和平。社会主义阵营是和平的堡垒。我们意识到社会主义国家肩负的历史任务是重大的，今后我们将继续共同坚定地走社会主义的道路。
    卡达尔和赫鲁晓夫的讲话，不断地博得到会者的鼓掌和欢呼。
    群众集会在下午二时结束。
