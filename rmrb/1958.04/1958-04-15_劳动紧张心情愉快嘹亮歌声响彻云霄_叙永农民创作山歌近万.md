Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 14th: This spring, the peasants of Xuyong County, Sichuan Province, have newly created nearly ten thousand folk songs, clappers, and ditties, singing of their heroic labor and their yearning for a better life.

"Swallow, swallow, fly quickly, take good news to Beijing, congratulate our leader Chairman Mao, early rice will have a bumper harvest of millions of catties!" This folk song was composed and sung by Ma Shuquan, a Communist Party member, and Chen Wenying, a Communist Youth League member, from Houshan Township while plowing fields during the spring plowing season. Because of insufficient oxen power, they took the lead in going down to the fields to pull the plow. Although the labor was heavy, their mood was so joyful. They also composed these two songs: "The scenery is good for spring plowing this year, every household is full of joy, everyone is working for the Great Leap Forward, every flower faces the sun." "The more we sing folk songs, the more energetic we become, the clearer the slogans we raise, as long as everyone works hard, a yield of a thousand catties per mu is sure to be achieved."

Almost every farming task, every project, the peasants quickly composed and sang new folk songs and clappers. Among them were those publicizing advanced technologies, such as the folk song of the peasants in Yu Fu Township: "In the second month, we are transplanting seedlings, the new method is definitely better than the old method, you understand the technology and he understands it too, seize the banner and hang it in the center." Wherever the project was the most arduous, the folk songs were even louder. In the project of transforming mountain tops in Tianchi Township, a high mountain area, thousands of men and women, old and young, labored hard, breaking the ice and treading through the snow. Among the many folk songs they composed was this one: "Not afraid of the thick snow on the high mountains, not afraid of ice, snow, and cold wind, thousands of troops fight day and night, conquering nine mountains in one night."

According to preliminary statistics from the Propaganda Department of the Xuyong County Party Committee, the peasants in the county have newly created approximately nine thousand nine hundred folk songs, clappers, etc.; a large-scale collection is currently underway. The county's cultural departments are also preparing to discover and systematically cultivate folk singers, and carry out folk song creation activities, so that there will be singing everywhere in the county's rural areas.

    劳动紧张心情愉快嘹亮歌声响彻云霄
    叙永农民创作山歌近万
    新华社成都14日电  今年春天，四川省叙永县农民新创作了近万首山歌、快板和顺口溜等，歌唱自己豪迈的劳动和对美好生活的向往。
    “燕儿燕儿快飞奔，带个喜讯到北京，祝贺领袖毛主席，早稻丰产千万斤。”这首山歌是后山乡共产党员马树全、共青团员陈文英等在春耕犁田时编唱的。因为牛力不足，他们带头下田拉犁。劳动虽然繁重，他们的心情却如此欢愉。他们还编了这样两首歌：“今年春耕好风光，家家户户喜洋洋，人人为着大跃进，朵朵鲜花向太阳。”“山歌越唱越有劲，口号越提越分明，只要大家努力干，亩产千斤一定成。”
    几乎每一项农活，每一处工程，农民们都很快地编唱出新的山歌、快板来。其中有宣传先进技术的，如鱼鳧乡农民的“二月里来正栽秧，新法硬比旧法强，你懂技术他也懂，夺得帅旗挂中央。”哪里的工程最艰巨，哪里的山歌就更嘹亮。在高山地区天池乡改造山头的工程中，成千男女老少破冰踏雪地艰苦劳动。他们编出的许多山歌中，有这样一首：“不怕高山积雪厚，不怕冰雪与风寒，千军万马日夜战，一夜攻下九重山。”
    据中共叙永县委宣传部初步统计，全县农民新创作的山歌、快板等约有九千九百多首；目前正在大量进行收集。县文化部门还准备深入发现和有计划地培养民间歌手，开展民歌创作活动，使全县农村处处有歌声。
