Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th - The Yellow River Conservancy Commission recently dispatched an exploration team to find a route to divert water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River for use in the Yellow River, in order to supplement the Yellow River's insufficient water source. This is another bold undertaking by our country, following the exploration of the source of the Yellow River in 1952, to explore the secrets of nature in the upper reaches of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River.

This exploration team has eleven cadres, including eight technical cadres. After they arrive in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, the agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and transportation departments of Sichuan Province will also send people to participate in the exploration. The exploration work is expected to be completed by August.

The route planned for this exploration is more than 1,000 kilometers long, and the exploration area is approximately 200,000 square kilometers. The areas to be explored include high mountains such as the Que'er Mountain, which is five to six thousand meters above sea level.

The water volume of the Yellow River has already played a significant role in the development of economic undertakings, and much work still needs to be done to further leverage its role. However, from the perspective of the economic development needs of the Yellow River basin, the existing water volume is not sufficient. Especially since the upsurge of socialist construction was launched last winter, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River have generally felt that the Yellow River water is insufficient. This exploration is being carried out to adapt to this new situation.

The water volume of the Yangtze River is very abundant. Its total water volume is equal to twenty times the total water volume of the Yellow River. This exploration aims to find a possible route from the Dege and Gangtuo area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to divert some of the water from the Jinsha River into the Yalong River, and then from the Ganzi and Aba areas in the Yalong River basin into the upper reaches of the Yellow River. If the Yellow River can receive a supply of more than 1,000 cubic meters per second through this route, the Yellow River's water volume can be increased by about twofold, the appearance of the Yellow River will undergo great changes, and new impetus can be obtained; farmland can be reclaimed, irrigation can be developed; a large number of hydroelectric power stations can be built; it can also serve as a navigation route connecting the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, so that the rich resources of the western minority areas of Sichuan Province can be rapidly and fully utilized.

### 黄河要借长江水  一支查勘队出发找线路

    黄河要借长江水
    一支查勘队出发找线路
    据新华社郑州16日电　黄河水利委员会最近派出一个查勘队，去寻找把长江上游的水借到黄河来使用的线路，以补黄河水源不足。这是我国继1952年查勘黄河河源后，又一次探索黄河和长江上游地区自然界秘密的豪迈事业。
    这个查勘队有十一名干部，其中有技术干部八名。他们到四川成都市后，四川省的农、林、水利、交通等部门也将派人参加查勘。查勘工作预计到8月才能结束。
    这次计划查勘的路线，有一千多公里；查勘面积约二十万平方公里。要查勘的地区包括拔海五、六千公尺高的雀儿山等大山。
    黄河的水量对发展经济事业已经起了很大作用，目前还需要做很多工作，进一步发挥它的作用。但是从黄河流域经济发展的需要来看，现有水量还不能满足。特别是从去年冬季掀起社会主义建设高潮以来，黄河中、下游更是普遍感到黄河水不足。这次出发查勘，就是为了适应这个新形势而进行的。
    长江的水量非常丰富。它的总水量等于黄河总水量的二十倍。这次查勘，是找一条可能从长江上游德格、岗拖一带，将金沙江的水引一部分入雅砻江，再从雅砻江流域的甘孜经阿坝等地区引入黄河上游的线路。如果黄河能经过这条线路得到一千以上秒公方流量的接济，黄河水量便可增加一倍左右，黄河面貌将发生很大的变化，可以得到新的推动力；可以开垦农田，发展灌溉；可以建设大批水力发电站；也可以作为沟通长江和黄河上游的航线，使四川省西部少数民族地区的丰富资源迅速得到充分利用。
