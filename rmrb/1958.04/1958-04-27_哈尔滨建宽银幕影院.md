    Harbin is building a wide-screen cinema that can accommodate more than 1,400 viewers. It is expected that the people of Harbin will be able to see wide-screen movies by National Day this year. The Heilongjiang 560 stereophonic wide-screen movie projector, recently successfully trial-produced by the Harbin Film Machinery Factory, will be used to equip this cinema.

    哈尔滨建宽银幕影院
    哈尔滨市正在兴建一座能容纳一千四百多观众的宽银幕电影院。预计今年国庆节，哈尔滨人民就可以看到宽银幕电影。哈尔滨电影机械厂新近试制成功的黑龙江五六○型立体声宽银幕电影放映机，将用来装备这个电影院。
