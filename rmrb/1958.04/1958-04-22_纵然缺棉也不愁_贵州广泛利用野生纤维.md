In Guizhou Province, where cotton production is low, using wild fibers to manufacture artificial cotton has become a great joy in the lives of people of all ethnic groups in mountainous areas. The Zunyi Artificial Cotton Factory, which officially started operations on April 1st, uses the fibers of eighteen kinds of wild plants such as paper mulberry bark, bamboo hemp, and rice straw to process cotton, producing two tons of artificial cotton per day. The handicraft departments of Zunyi City use this artificial cotton to make four kinds of products, including cotton cloth, cotton yarn, shoe thread, and scarves, to supply market needs. After successful trials of artificial cotton production in more than twenty counties and cities including Jinsha, Zhenning, Leishan, Guiyang, and Chishui, they have also begun to build factories for production. The thirteen counties and cities in Zunyi Prefecture plan to produce a total of 7,000 tons of artificial cotton this year, which is about one and a half times more than Guizhou Province's total cotton output last year.

Guizhou is also starting to establish processing organizations for the newly discovered 190+ types of wild oil plants. Take Litsea cubeba, which is produced in every county, for example. The province has begun to establish 436 processing groups. As soon as the harvest season arrives, they will carry the machines deep into the mountains to process the high-grade fragrant oil – Litsea cubeba oil. The 268 processing groups used to squeeze other wild oil materials in various places have also been established successively, planning to produce 1,500 tons of oil this year.

All of the province's 300+ wineries have begun to use special wild starches such as *Polygonum multiflorum* and *Hedychium sinoaureum* to brew wine. This year, the province will use wild plants to brew 10,000 tons of wine, saving enough grain to feed 100,000 people for a year. A native product processing factory newly built in Jinping County, Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, can process over 840,000 *jin* of roasted glue and transparent rosin annually using locally abundant *Boehmeria nivea*, pine trees, *Paris fargesii*, and other plants.

    纵然缺棉也不愁
    贵州广泛利用野生纤维
    在产棉很少的贵州省，利用野生纤维制造人造棉已成为山区各族人民生活中的一大喜事。4月1日正式开工的遵义人造棉厂，利用构皮、竹麻、稻草等十八种野生植物的纤维加工棉花，日产人造棉两吨。遵义市的手工业部门用这种人造棉制成棉布、棉纱、鞋线、围巾等四种产品，供应市场需要。金沙、镇宁、雷山、贵阳、赤水等二十多县市试制人造棉成功后，也着手办厂生产。遵义专区十三个县市今年共计划生产人造棉七千吨，比贵州全省去年棉花产量约多一倍半。
    贵州各地还开始为新发现的一百九十多种野生油料成立加工机构。拿县县都出产的山苍籽来说，现在全省已着手成立四百三十六个加工组，只待收获季节一到，就抬着机器深入山区流动加工高级香料油——山苍籽油。各地用来榨其他野生油料的二百六十八个加工组也相继建立，今年计划产油一千五百吨。
    全省三百多个酒厂都开始利用面杠子、胥虎姜等特种野生淀粉来酿酒。今年全省利用野生植物酿酒一万吨，节约的粮食可供十万人吃一年。在黔东南苗族侗族自治州锦屏县新建的一所土特产加工厂，利用当地盛产的面杠树、松树、朱砂莲等，每年可加工烤胶、透明松香八十四万多斤。
