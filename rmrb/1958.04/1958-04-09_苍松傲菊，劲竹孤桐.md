Towering Pine, Proud Chrysanthemum, Vigorous Bamboo, Solitary Tung Tree

Today is Paul Robeson's sixtieth birthday. Across the vast Pacific Ocean, we wish him eternal youth and longevity.

I am not a person who understands music, but whenever I hear his singing, I feel a sense of solemnity. The solemn song comes from a solemn person, and the perfect song represents a perfect personality.

Apart from "Arise" ("The March of the Volunteers") which he sang in Chinese, I particularly like listening to his "John Brown's Body." I feel that Paul Robeson singing this song is the most perfect embodiment of truth, beauty, and goodness.

One hundred and four years ago, John Brown, the leader of an American peasant revolution, was wounded and captured in battle. When he was sentenced to death, he said proudly:

"I, John Brown, am now fully convinced that only blood can wash away the great sins of this sinful nation."

When Marx heard this news, he told the world: "This is the greatest event in the world today." John Brown died, but his spirit did not die. Ten years later, the "Workers' Corps" led by Marx's friends Weitling and Schillmann continued his spirit and moved forward. "John Brown's Body" became the most beloved song of the American working people, and for a century, this song has been inspiring the American people to move forward.

When Paul Robeson performed, "John Brown" was often his "encore" piece. On February 9th this year, when he broke through the suppression of the American authorities and held a concert in Oakland, the news report said: "At the end of the concert, Robeson led the singing of 'John Brown's Body,' and the entire crowd enthusiastically participated in the chorus." This is a moving scene. America is not just the America of the Dulles types, nor is it just the America of the Fast types. There are also thousands of honest and brave Americans, and there is an America represented by Paul Robeson, inheriting the spirit of John Brown!

Persecution, suppression, and endless slander and defamation cannot shake Paul Robeson's courage and confidence in the slightest. Those who believe in and adhere to the truth are fearless. In the winter of 1934, when fascist arrogance was at its most rampant, he traveled to Moscow and was attacked by Nazi elements when passing through Berlin. For twenty years, he has not been intimidated by the violence of the fascist elements and the slander of the "Federal Bureau of Investigation." He takes pride in being a loyal friend of the Soviet Union. He has repeatedly stated publicly that the Soviet Union is the most reliable fortress of world peace. Last November, on the eve of the great October Socialist Revolution, he gave a speech to the Soviet people via television. He represented the honest, kind, and peace-loving American people, expressing heartfelt congratulations and wishes. Let us compare him with the shameless revolutionary traitor Fast. How lofty and great he is, and how humble and insignificant Fast is!

Paul Robeson is a towering pine, a proud chrysanthemum, Paul Robeson is a vigorous bamboo, a solitary tung tree.

Today is his sixtieth birthday. Today, he will spend this celebratory day in his motherland shrouded in dark clouds. However, he will not feel lonely at all. Today, from Moscow to Beijing, from Delhi to Rome, from London to New York, a chorus of congratulations will ring out. Justice will surely prevail, and Paul Robeson will surely gain freedom. His voice has wings, and his voice cannot be banned by Dulles' laws. Dear Paul, sing, be happy! At this time when the East wind is prevailing over the West wind, use your singing voice to sing out peace, sing out the dawn of America!

    苍松傲菊，劲竹孤桐
    夏衍
    今天是保罗·罗伯逊的六十华诞，隔着辽阔的太平洋，我们祝贺他永远年青、长寿。
    我是不懂音乐的人，但是一听到他的歌声就会引起一种庄严之感。庄严的歌声出自庄严的人，完美无缺的歌声正代表了一个完美无缺的人格。
    除出他用中国话唱的“起来”（“义勇军进行曲”）之外，我特别欢喜听他的那支“约翰·布朗的尸体”。我觉得，由保罗·罗伯逊来唱这支歌，才是真、美、善的最完美的体现。
    距今一百○四年之前，美国的一个农民革命的领袖约翰·布朗在战斗中受伤被俘，当他被判死刑的时候，他傲然地说：
    “我，约翰·布朗，现在十分确信，只有血才能洗掉这个罪恶国家的大罪。”
    马克思听到这个消息的时候，就告诉全世界说：“这是现在世界上的最大事件”。约翰·布朗死了，他的精神并没有死，十年之后，马克思的朋友魏特玛耶和锡尔曼所领导的“工人团”继续着他的精神而前进了。“约翰·布朗的尸体”成了美国劳动人民最喜爱的歌，一世纪来，这支歌一直鼓舞着美国人民前进。
    保罗·罗伯逊演唱的时候，“约翰·布朗”经常是他“压轴”的节目。今年2月9日，当他冲破了美国当局的禁压而在奥克兰市举行演唱会的时候，新闻报道中说：“在演唱结束的时候，罗伯逊领唱了‘约翰·布朗的尸体’，全体群众热烈地参加了合唱。”这是一个动人的情景。美国不单单是杜勒斯之流的美国，也不单是法斯特之流的美国，这儿还有千千万万正直、勇敢的美国人，这儿还有一个以保罗·罗伯逊为代表的、继承着约翰·布朗精神的美国！
    迫害、压制和无穷无尽的污蔑毁谤，丝毫不能动摇保罗·罗伯逊的勇气和信心。相信和坚持真理的人是无畏的。1934年冬，当法西斯气焰最嚣张的时候，他到莫斯科去旅行，路经柏林，他就遭到了纳粹分子的袭击，二十年来，他一直没有被法西斯分子的暴力和“联邦调查局”的诬蔑所吓倒，他以一个苏联的忠实的朋友作为自己的骄傲，他一再公言，苏联是世界和平的最可靠的堡垒。去年11月，在伟大的十月社会主义革命的前夕，他通过电视向苏联人民发表了谈话。他代表正直、善良和热爱和平的美国人民，表示了出自内心的祝贺和愿望。让我们拿他来和无耻的革命叛徒法斯特对比一下吧，他是何等的崇高伟大，法斯特是何等的卑贱渺小！
    保罗·罗伯逊是苍松傲菊，保罗·罗伯逊是劲竹孤桐。
    今天，是他六十岁的生日，今天，他将在阴云低迷的他的祖国，度过这个值得庆贺的日子。可是，他将一点也不感到寂寞。今天，从莫斯科到北京，从德里到罗马，从伦敦到纽约，将响起一片祝贺的欢声。正义一定要胜利，保罗·罗伯逊一定会得到自由。他的声音带着翅膀，他的声音是不能用杜勒斯的法律来禁止的。亲爱的保罗，唱吧，高兴吧，值此东风压倒了西风的时候，用你的歌喉，唱出和平来，唱出美利坚的黎明来吧。
