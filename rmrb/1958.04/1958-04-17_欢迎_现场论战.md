    Welcome "On-Site Debate"
    Wu Lü
    The "on-site debate" at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is a new, lively form of socialist democracy. This form is a new application of great airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates in industrial and mining enterprises.
    Currently, big-character posters are all the rage. In any enterprise of considerable size, there are tens of thousands of big-character posters. Many "watermelons" have been brought out. However, some "watermelons" are difficult to handle all at once. There are many reasons for this, of course, but one cannot deny that the bigger the "watermelon," the wider the scope it involves, often implicating everything up, down, left, right, inside, and out, and thus the problem is more complex. To handle such a "watermelon" really requires a process. If only big-character posters are used as weapons, it is not enough. "On-site debate" is a good way to "handle watermelons." It organizes the opposing or multiple parties together for direct engagement, on-the-spot debate, making it easier to distinguish right from wrong and solve problems.
    "On-site debate" is a form of great debate, but it differs from general great debates. General great debates mainly solve ideological problems by presenting facts, reasoning, and discussing ideas. "On-site debate" also aims to solve ideological problems, but the method is not only to present facts and reason, but also to bring out material evidence and demonstrate examples, thus being both "abstract" and "practical." "If you don't believe my words, you can look at the material evidence," "If you don't believe my suggestion, I'll do it for you on the spot." This debate method, which has both ideology and practicality, is more vivid, more concrete, and more lively than general debates. It is no accident that it has attracted a wide range of workers and staff at the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.
    The rectification of the previous stage has brought about unprecedented revolutionary vigor. At the sound of the Great Leap Forward, thousands of horses galloped. Setting targets, formulating plans, it was a booming and widespread movement. At that time, the situation was pressing, and the leadership had not had time to handle all the "watermelons" before having to withdraw to the ranks of the Great Leap Forward to lead the masses in the Great Leap Forward. Later, with the irresistible revolutionary spirit of the masses, some "watermelon" problems were also solved in the Great Leap Forward, especially the fire of the "double anti" campaign burned very fiercely, solving significant problems. But this stage was mainly about opposing conservatism, opposing waste, and making a Great Leap Forward, and some other "watermelons" were left behind. Now that targets, plans, etc., are generally in place, the important thing is to formulate measures and implement them. These measures are both simple and complex. Simple, they are nothing more than specific methods; complex, the formulation and implementation of any specific method are linked to more specific and more complex ideological problems, with many "watermelons" among them. Therefore, in finding measures, the Great Leap Forward still needs to "handle watermelons." How to combine great rectification and great change with the Great Leap Forward, breaking down the old while establishing the new, is still a very important issue. "On-site debate" is a good way to break the old and establish the new. In a debate, right and wrong are distinguished, good and bad are understood, and measures are then produced.

    欢迎“现场论战”
    吴滤
    沈阳第一机床厂的“现场论战”，是社会主义民主的一种新的生动活泼的形式。这种形式是大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论在工矿企业中的新的运用。
    现在，大字报盛极一时。随便哪个规模较大的企业，大字报都是数以万计的。“西瓜”也端出了不少。然而，有些“西瓜”一下子很难抱动。这原因当然很多，但有一条却是不能不承认的：“西瓜”越大，牵涉的方面越广，常常是上下左右、里里外外都牵连在里面了，因而问题也比较复杂。像这样的“西瓜”要抱起来，确实需要一个过程。若是只用大字报这一种武器，就嫌不够了。“现场论战”是个“抱西瓜”的好办法。它把矛盾的双方或几方组织在一起，短兵相接，当场论战，是非比较容易分清，问题也比较容易解决。
    “现场论战”是大辩论的一种形式，但又不同于一般的大辩论。一般的大辩论，主要是通过摆事实，讲道理、谈思想的方法来解决思想问题的。“现场论战”也是要解决思想问题，但方法不只是摆事实、讲道理，还加上拿出物证和做出样子等等，因而是既“务虚”又“务实”的。“你要不服我的话，可以看看物证”，“你要不信我的建议，当场做给你看看”。这种既有思想又有实际的辩论方法，比一般的辩论更加形象，更加具体，也更加生动活泼。它在沈阳第一机床厂吸引了广大的职工，显然不是偶然的。
    前一阶段的整改，整出空前未有的革命干劲来。一声大跃进，万马奔腾。提指标、订规划、轰轰烈烈、遍地开花。那时候，形势逼人，领导上还没有来得及抱尽“西瓜”，就不得不抽身到跃进的行列中来，领导群众大跃进。后来，借着群众锐不可当的革命志气，在大跃进中也解决了一些“西瓜”问题，特别是“双反”的烈火烧得很是猛烈，解决了很大的问题。但这一段，毕竟主要是反保守、反浪费、大跃进，也还留下一些别的“西瓜”。现在，指标、规划等等，大体都有了，重要的是制订措施付诸实现。这措施，也简单也复杂。说简单，无非是些具体办法而已；说复杂，任何一个具体办法的制订和实现，都同更具体的、更复杂的思想问题连在一起，其中“西瓜”多得很。因而找措施，大跃进还需要“抱西瓜”，怎样把大整、大改同大跃进结合起来，一方面破掉旧的东西，一方面立起新的东西，还是一个十分重要的问题。“现场论战”正是破旧立新的好办法。一场论战，是非分清了，好坏明白了，措施也就出来了。
