    Bao Yulan Does the Abacus
    Zhang Xuexin

    The meeting adjourned. Bao Yulan, with unrestrained excitement, walked out of the venue with the emotionally charged crowd.

    Bao Yulan only entered the joint public-private yarn tube factory as an apprentice last July. She is the only daughter of an old worker, and has been stubborn and straightforward since she was a child, always seeking the truth. Since becoming an apprentice in the paint shop, she has always offered her opinion when she sees people not arriving on time for work or wandering around while working. Once, the paint shop experimented with using honey to mix paint. After the experiment, half a bowl of honey was left over. Several workers divided up the honey water, and even the workshop manager drank a portion, smacking his lips and exclaiming, "So sweet!" Bao Yulan couldn't help but say on the spot, "Honey is sweet, but the money is public money. The leaders should set an example!" Master Li, who drank the honey water, couldn't save face and retorted, "You don't need to lecture people, it's not your family's anyway."

    Since that retort, some of the master craftsmen treated her differently. When she asked about work, they would hum and haw, and pay little attention to her. The administrator even criticized her indirectly at a workshop meeting, saying, "Some apprentices don't respect the master craftsmen, don't learn the techniques properly, and just love to talk and find fault..." Bao Yulan was so angry that she cried and complained to the chairman of the union. The chairman said "we'll look into it," but nothing happened. From then on, Bao Yulan harbored a bellyful of resentment. She buried herself in learning techniques, always thinking: once I’ve learned enough, I’ll find a way to jump to another factory, to a state-owned factory. There’s no future in a joint venture factory.

    Soon, the rectification began, and Bao Yulan felt that the factory was changing. Today, there was a Great Leap Forward meeting! Ah! The quality of our yarn tubes will catch up with England in three years, and the output will double this year. The enthusiastic speeches of the master craftsmen and the challenges and responses of each group, that drive, made Bao Yulan feel a little surprised. What moved her the most was the speech of Factory Director Liu. The factory director made a self-criticism in front of more than a hundred workers. (But everyone knew that since Factory Director Liu came to the factory on the day of the joint venture, he had put his whole heart into the factory. For more than two years, in order to transform this factory, he often didn't go home for three or five days, and slept on the chair in the factory director's office in the middle of the night.) Factory Director Liu said that everyone is the master of the factory, called on everyone to love the factory as their home, and even publicly praised Bao Yulan and two other workers. The speeches at the meeting were like a spring breeze, and Bao Yulan's bellyful of resentment had long been blown away without a trace.

    Bao Yulan walked silently along the Hai River, the lights on the opposite bank reflected in the calm river water, like a sky full of stars. She thought about today's meeting, about every friendly face in the factory, about her experiences in the factory for more than half a year... The thought of her idea to "jump to another factory" made her feel ashamed and blame herself: "What kind of master of the factory is this!"

    Back home, her mother had been waiting anxiously. "You! It's almost nine o'clock, why are you back so late..." She took the lunch box from her daughter's hand and kept asking, "Are you tired? Are you hungry?" Although Bao Yulan felt that she was already a worker, her mother always regarded her as a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl.

    "Wash your face and eat quickly. Your father won't be back tonight either. The message said that something was going on in the factory tonight, something about a big... Great Leap Forward. You and your father are the same, neither of you cares about the family." Her mother, while grumbling, went to the kitchen.

    At dinner, her mother routinely reported the day's expenses to her daughter. According to the division of labor in the family, Yulan was in charge of accounting. Her mother bent each of her fingers and reported the accounts one by one: "Bought small fish for two mao five, enough for two days. Bought salt, one mao. Bought a foot of white cloth, three mao. To mend your sock bottoms... Oh, look, I almost forgot. A small tinker came to the door today and sawed the broken porcelain bowl you broke for only five fen. Buying a new one would cost more than two mao. You young people don't understand, when we were young..." Her mother, with deep memories, talked about the hard days of picking coal cinders and living in shacks, which she had said a hundred times...

    Bao Yulan looked at the wrinkles on her mother's face, which were weathered by the wind and frost, and suddenly had a strange idea: "If my mother were to manage a factory, to be a thrift committee member, that would definitely...". Her heart flew back to the factory again; "Yes, we have to calculate carefully. If a porcelain bowl is broken, it can be sawn together. Why can't those worn-out tools in the factory be repaired and reused? I heard from the master craftsmen that the knives used on the woodworking beds are all imported high-speed steel, and each one costs twenty or thirty yuan, but they throw them into the scrap pile after only a few days of use... That's right, we have to pick them up! This is one thing."

    Her mother noticed that her daughter was staring straight at the ceiling in a daze, and quickly stopped her endless talk, and went over to stroke Yulan's soft hair, and said kindly: "Lan'er, are you tired? Go to bed early."

    Yulan was still staring straight ahead, thinking about things, and just shook her head and said: "I'm not tired! Mom, you go to sleep first, I still have something to do."

    At this time, the entire factory was in front of Bao Yulan, she was looking at it corner by corner, searching:

    She saw the scrap pile that looked like a small mountain. "Yes! The waste in our factory is mainly on this wood. When cutting materials, we use wide materials for narrow purposes, and so much good pine wood that can be used for wood is sold as firewood. Why can't we save as much as my mother does when cutting clothes? How many more weft yarn tubes would that produce!"

    "Stoves! The big fire stoves made of gasoline drums in the workshop are burning red every day. Everyone is shouting 'roasting sweet potatoes,' but no one cares. At least a hundred catties of coal must be wasted a day."

    Bao Yulan also thought of her especially intimate paint shop, and seemed to smell the pungent smell of paint again. "The gasoline and alcohol used for mixing paint, people always forget to cover the lids, and the gasoline all flies away with the air. How much would this waste invisibly! Oh, and the Vaseline. It was originally used for paint protection, but comrades put a thick layer on their faces before leaving work, and Xiao Wang's collar is almost a big oily twist." She almost laughed out loud when she thought of Xiao Wang's greasy collar covered with Vaseline. She asked herself: "Is this a small matter? It's not a small matter. Why aren't we so generous with our own things?"

    The more Bao Yulan thought about it, the more excited she became, and the more she thought about. The paint trays that are often broken, the basketballs that are discarded everywhere, the rice that the master chef in the canteen pours into the trash can...

    She decided to calculate carefully to see how much was being wasted in the end. She took out the small abacus she used when she was in elementary school from the drawer and calculated it one by one. It was okay if she didn't calculate, but when she calculated, she was shocked. At least more than 10,000 yuan would be wasted a year just on useful wood.

    The alarm clock on the table ticked and ticked. Bao Yulan was lying on the table, clicking and clicking, dialing the abacus, and constantly chanting, "Wood," "firewood," "coal," "gasoline"...

    Her mother's voice came from the inner room: "Lan'er, haven't you finished keeping the accounts yet? Calculate again tomorrow, go to sleep!"

### 鲍玉兰打算盘

    鲍玉兰打算盘张学新
    散会了。鲍玉兰带着不可抑制的兴奋，随着情绪激昂的人群走出会场。
    鲍玉兰去年7月才考进公私合营纱管厂当徒工。她是一个老工人的独生女，自小是个倔脾气，心直口快，凡事爱找个直理。到工厂漆房当学徒以来，看到有的人不按时上班，干活时东走西串，总爱提个意见。一次，漆房里试验用蜂蜜调漆，试验以后剩下半碗蜜，几个工人分着喝了蜜水，连车间管理员也喝了一份儿，还咂咂嘴，嚷着：“真甜！”鲍玉兰忍不住，当场说了一句：“蜂蜜是甜的，钱可是公家的。领导还起模范作用！”喝过蜜水的李师傅脸上挂不住，顶了她一句：“用不着你来教训人，反正不是你家的。”
    自从那次顶嘴以后，个别老师傅对她就两样了。她问个活时，总是哼哼哈哈，带搭不理，管理员还在车间的全体会上指鸡骂狗的批评了她，说：“有些徒工不尊重老师傅，不好好学技术，就爱东说西道，鸡蛋里挑刺……”。鲍玉兰为这事气得哭了一场，给工会主席提了意见。工会主席说“研究研究”，可是一直没有下文。从那，鲍玉兰别了一肚子闷气。她整天埋头学技术，心里一直想：学满了，想法跳厂子，到国营工厂去，合营厂没个干头。
    不久，整风开始了，鲍玉兰感觉到工厂起了变化。今天开跃进大会，啊！我们的纱管质量要在三年内赶上英国，产量今年就要增加一倍。老师傅们的热情的讲话，各小组的挑战应战，那股干劲，使鲍玉兰都感到有点吃惊。最使她感动的是刘厂长的讲话。厂长当着一百多个工人进行自我检讨，（可是谁都知道，刘厂长自从合营那天到厂以后，就把心整个搁在工厂里了。两年多来，为了改造这个工厂，他经常三天五天不回家，半夜里就睡在厂长室的椅子上。）刘厂长说，每个人都是工厂的主人，号召大家爱厂如家，还当场表扬了鲍玉兰和别的两个工人。会上的讲话像一阵阵春风，鲍玉兰的一肚子闷气早已被吹得无影无踪。
    鲍玉兰沿海河默默地走着，对岸的灯光倒映在平静的河水里，像是满天的星斗。她想着今天的大会，想着工厂的每一个亲切的面孔，想着自己到工厂这半年多的经历，……一想到自己“跳厂”的念头，不觉羞愧的责怪自己：“这算什么工厂的主人呵！”
    回到家来，妈妈早等急了。“你呀！都快九点了，怎么这会儿才回来……”她从女儿手里接过饭盒来，又“累不累？饿不饿？”的问个没完。虽说鲍玉兰觉得自己已经是个工人了，可是母亲还总把她看成十四、五岁的小姑娘。
    “擦把脸，快吃饭吧。今个你爸爸又不回来了。捎回信来说，今晚上厂里有事，闹什么大……大跃进。你们爷俩呀，一模一样，谁也不顾个家。”母亲一边唠叨着走到厨房去了。
    吃饭时，母亲照例向女儿汇报一天的花销，按照家庭分工，玉兰担任会计。母亲弯曲着一根根手指，一宗一宗的报着账：“买小鱼二毛五，够两天吃了。打盐，一毛。买了一尺白布，三毛。给你补袜底……唉，你看，差点给忘了。今个门口来了个小炉匠，把你打破的那个磁碗锯了锯，才花了五分钱，再买个新的还不得两毛多。你们年青人不明白，俺们年青的时候……”母亲带着深沉的回忆，又说起了说过一百遍的那些拣煤核、住窝铺的苦日子……。
    鲍玉兰看着母亲脸上饱经风霜的皱纹，突然引起一个奇怪的想法“要是让母亲去管个工厂，当个节约委员，那一定……”。她的心又飞到工厂去了；“是啊，得算细账，磁碗打破了能锯起来，厂里那些磨损的工具为什么不能修理一下再用呢。听老师傅说木工床子上用的那些刀具都是进口的锋钢，一把就是二、三十元，可是他们用不了多少天就扔到烂铁堆里去了……。对，要把它拣回来！这是一条。”
    母亲发现女儿两眼直直的盯着屋顶发楞，赶紧收起了自己三天三夜说不完的话，过去抚摸着玉兰柔滑的头发，亲切的说：“兰儿，累了，早点睡吧。”
    玉兰两眼还直盯盯的想着心事，只摇摇头说：“我不累！妈，你先睡吧，我还有事。”
    这时，整个工厂都摆在鲍玉兰眼前了，她一个角落一个角落的查看着，搜寻着：
    她看到了那像座小山一样的废料堆。“是啊！我们厂的浪费，主要就在这木料上。下料时，宽打窄用，多少能做木料的好松木，都当劈柴卖了。为什么不能像母亲裁衣服一样节省呢？那该多出多少纬纱管呀！”
    “炉子！车间里那几个汽油桶做的大火炉，天天烧得通红。大家直嚷“烤山芋”，可是没人管，一天至少得浪费一百斤煤。”
    鲍玉兰又想到了自己特别亲切的漆房，好像又闻到了那股呛人的油漆气味。“调漆用的汽油、火酒，人们总忘记盖盖子，汽油都随空气飞走了，这无形中该浪费多少呀！噢，还有那凡士林。本来是防漆用的，可是同志们下班以前每人抹一脸，抹得厚厚的，小王的领子都快变成一条大油条了。”她想起小王被凡士林抹的油腻腻的领子，几乎笑出声来。她问自己：“这是小事吗？不是小事。自己家的东西为什么就不这样大方呢？”
    鲍玉兰越想越兴奋，越想越多了。那经常打破的漆盘子，无人负责到处乱丢的篮球，食堂大师傅倒在垃圾箱里的大米饭……
    她决定要好好算算账，看看倒底浪费多少。她从抽屉里找出自己上小学时用过的小算盘，一五一十的打起来。不算不要紧，一算，连自己也吓了一跳。光有用的木料一年至少得浪费一万多元。
    条案上的闹钟嘀?嘀?响着，鲍玉兰伏在桌子上，拍哒拍哒的拨动着算盘，嘴里不住的念着，“木料”，“劈柴”，“煤”，“汽油”……
    里屋里传来母亲的声音：“兰儿，还没记好账？明天再算，快睡去吧！”
