    Harbin Electrical Manufacturing School Combines Specializations with Production
    (By our newspaper) Harbin Electrical Manufacturing School, based on the principle of combining theory with practice and education with production, has decided to integrate industrial production as much as possible with its specializations. This will enable students to acquire practical production knowledge, strengthen their labor training, and correct bourgeois viewpoints that belittle physical labor, while also creating wealth for the country. According to the school's existing machinery and equipment, they plan to produce four thousand A4 model 4.5 kW small motors and four hundred new-style electric welders this year. They can also undertake processing orders for plumbing and hardware materials.
    In order to give students more opportunities to learn practical production knowledge, the school has reformed the teaching system. It has decided to appropriately revise the teaching plan and syllabus, reducing some unnecessary courses and increasing production practice, on the principle of not extending the length of schooling and basically maintaining the original cultural and theoretical level.

    哈尔滨电器制造学校结合专业进行生产
    本报讯　哈尔滨电器制造学校依据理论联系实际、教育结合生产的原则，决定尽量结合专业进行工业生产。这样可以使学生获得实际的生产知识，加强劳动锻炼，纠正轻视体力劳动的资产阶级观点，同时也可以为国家生产财富。根据该校现有的机械设备，他们计划今年生产A4号4.5瓩小型电机四千台，新式电焊机四百台，还可承制水暖五金器材等加工订货。
    为着使学生能有更多的机会学习实际生产知识，该校改革了教学制度，决定在不延长学制和基本上仍保持原订文化和理论水平的原则下，适当修改教学计划和教学大纲，减少一些不必要的课程，增加生产实习。
