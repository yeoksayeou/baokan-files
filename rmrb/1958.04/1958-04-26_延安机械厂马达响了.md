    Motors Hum at Yan'an Machinery Factory
    The Yan'an Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant, which began construction in March of this year, officially started manufacturing hillside plows, waterwheels (both hand-cranked and foot-pedaled), small steel mills, and rice milling machines for farmers on April 10th. Most of the equipment for this factory was drawn from the repair workshops of the Yan'an Power Plant, Flour Mill, Oil Mill, etc. After being centralized, it can not only completely repair the machines of each factory but also manufacture new products, increasing the efficiency of machine utilization threefold compared to the original.
    Currently, the workers of this repair and manufacturing plant are rushing to build two rice milling machines as gifts to celebrate the "May Day" holiday.

    延安机械厂马达响了
    今年3月着手兴建的延安机械修造厂，在4月10日已正式开始为农民制造山地步犁、水车（手摇、脚踏两种）、小钢磨、碾米机等。这个厂的设备，大多是从延安电厂、面粉厂、油厂等都设有修理车间抽来的。集中起来后，不仅可全部包修各厂的机器，还可制造新产品，使机器利用效率比原来提高三倍。
    目前，这个修造厂的工人正在赶造两部碾米机，作为他们向“五一”节的献礼。
