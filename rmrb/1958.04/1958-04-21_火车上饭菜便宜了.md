    Food on Trains is Cheaper
    For a long time, passengers have had many opinions about the high price and restrictions of the dining car meals on trains. In this rectification, we have accepted the opinions of passengers and have improved the supply method. The original fixed meals of one yuan and six jiao have been changed to five jiao per serving, and the dishes of five jiao and seven jiao are now sold individually, allowing for free selection. The new supply method has been implemented since April 10th.

    火车上饭菜便宜了
    很久以来，旅客们对火车上餐车的饭菜售价贵、限制多，有很多意见。在这次整改中，我们接受旅客们的意见，已经改进了供应办法，把原来一元及六角的定食改为五角一份，五角及七角的菜也改为零售，随意选购。新供应办法已自4月10日开始实行。
