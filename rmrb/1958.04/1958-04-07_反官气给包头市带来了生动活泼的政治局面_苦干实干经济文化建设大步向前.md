Baotou Dispatch from our Newspaper: Reporter Lin Tian reports: The movement to concentrate on opposing bureaucracy in Baotou City, like a spring breeze and rain, has swept through every corner of Baotou City. A lively and vigorous political situation is taking shape, and the torrent of a great leap forward in economic and cultural construction is rolling forward.

This deeply rooted movement began with a city-wide representative conference of the Chinese Communist Party in Baotou. More than 300 representatives, composed of the city's Party backbone and activists, gathered for half a day and then all plunged into the ranks of workers and masses, directly conveying the central government's instructions on the "double opposition" (opposing waste and conservatism), and taking the lead in speaking out freely. After three to five days and nights, a high tide of the "double opposition" was launched throughout the city. Hundreds of thousands of workers in the city posted two million big-character posters. Based on the revelations in the big-character posters, the conference decided to first concentrate on opposing bureaucracy.

A big-character poster from Team One of the First Engineering Company of Baotou Steel, entitled "The Secret on the Ceiling," revealed the following incident: Last year, construction workers found eleven discarded planks, eight poles more than two meters long, and more than six hundred red bricks abandoned in the ceilings of just twelve houses. This is not a major problem in the waste cases exposed by the workers, but it clearly illustrates the seriousness of bureaucracy in leadership. Before this, the leadership had no idea that such a thing existed. However, the workers had long ago noticed the bureaucracy of the leaders. They called their captain, Gao Xiaoda, "High Official," because Gao Xiaoda rarely went to the construction site and would only point fingers and scold people when he did. They called their Communist Youth League branch secretary "Young Master Material Frame," because this branch secretary wandered around all day wearing wool clothes and did no practical work. They called their material clerk "Young Master Hands-Off." These people were either "sitting firmly on the dragon throne" in the office, or "you carry the materials in front, and he follows behind with his hands in his pockets."

The Baotou City Party Congress immediately made a resolution to launch a movement throughout the city to concentrate on eliminating bureaucracy. The day after the resolution was made, the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, the mayor, and the heads of various units went to construction sites, workshops, and store outlets to learn from the workers as apprentices, participate in labor, and learn skills. In just two or three days, more than 2,000 leading cadres at all levels throughout the city were working and living with the workers. The North China Baotou Construction Company, led by Party Secretary Lü Wenshan, had more than 800 cadres move from the dormitory building to the workers' sheds. The workers were so happy that they jumped up, snatched the cadres' bedding rolls, and competed for the cadres to come to their groups. These cadres lived in the sheds, talked with the workers at night, and got up in the morning to fetch water, make fires, sweep the floor, and work with the workers after work.

After the leading personnel went down, they realized even more deeply how serious their bureaucracy was. At the "Double Opposition" exhibition of the Third Construction Office of Huabei Construction, there were self-portraits of cadres' bureaucratism. One of them showed two people, one slamming the table and scolding, and the other being scolded, with sweat pouring down his head. Party Secretary Li Quanpu introduced to Comrade Su Qianyi, the First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, who was visiting: The person scolding is me, and I have this kind of bureaucratic air.

To completely eliminate bureaucracy, it is not enough for leading cadres to generally participate in labor and accept the supervision and criticism of the masses. Therefore, the Baotou Municipal Party Committee proposed that cadres should cultivate "experimental plots" based on changing their work style.

The cadres of Team One of the First Engineering Company of Baotou Steel do political work in the work teams and organize the Great Leap Forward in labor, which is a better way. After cadres go to the teams, they should do four things: First, learn from the workers as apprentices and work with the workers honestly; second, talk with the workers and make friends, and publicize the Party's policies; third, humbly listen to the workers' opinions, discover problems, and help solve them in a timely manner; fourth, help the teams formulate a Great Leap Forward plan and set an example for other teams, using a point to lead the whole area. Functional personnel also all go out of the office, delivering materials to the door and providing on-site services. As a result of their actions, in less than ten days, they have achieved great results, not only further strengthening the relationship between cadres and workers, but also combining political work and organizational work. Many long-term problems that could not be solved in the past have been solved this time.

With the opposition to bureaucracy came a high tide of production and cultural construction in the Great Leap Forward. Now, the six major state-owned enterprises in Baotou and dozens of local state-owned industrial enterprises, as well as cultural, educational, and health departments, have not only formulated Great Leap Forward plans, but are also working hard and practically to achieve these plans. By March 28, more than 20 state-owned and local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in the city had overfulfilled their first-quarter production plans. The workers working on the Baiyun Ebo Iron Mine, after launching the anti-bureaucracy movement, cadres and technicians participated in labor in the face of gale force winds, with an attendance rate of 100%, and overfulfilled the monthly plan for March by 50%. In the Hedong District, with a population of more than 200,000, from March 15 to 17, a privately run junior high school class and sixteen privately run primary school classes were established, allowing all 22 high school graduates who had not gone on to higher education and 802 children of school age in the district to enroll in school. Then, more than 13,000 young and middle-aged illiterate people were organized to participate in amateur cultural studies.

The changes in Baotou City in the past half month are comparable to half a year or a year in ordinary times, and may not even be comparable at all. But this is just the beginning. On this basis, continuous efforts will achieve even greater achievements.

    反官气给包头市带来了生动活泼的政治局面
    苦干实干经济文化建设大步向前
    本报包头电　记者林田报道：包头市集中反对官气的运动，如同春风春雨一样吹洒遍了包头市的各个角落，生动活泼的政治局面正在形成，经济、文化建设大跃进的巨流正滚滚向前。
    这个深入人心的运动，是从中共包头市一次全市代表大会开始的，由全市党的骨干和积极分子组成的三百多名代表们，集会半天之后，就全部投入职工群众中，直接向职工群众传达中央关于双反的指示，带头鸣放，经过三、五昼夜，就在全市范围内发动起了双反高潮。全市十几万职工贴出大字报二百万张。根据大字报的揭露，这个大会决定首先集中力量反对官气。
    包钢第一工程公司一队有一张题为“天棚上的秘密”的大字报，揭露了这样一件事情：去年，构缝工仅在十二栋房子的天棚里，就发现了丢弃的跳板十一块、两公尺多长的杆子八根、红砖六百多块。这在职工们揭发的浪费事例中，不算什么大问题，但它突出地说明了领导上的官气非常严重。在这以前，领导上根本不知道有这样的事情。但工人却早已发觉领导上的官气，他们叫他们的队长高孝达是“高官僚”，因为高孝达轻易不下工地，一到工地就指手划脚训人。他们叫他们的团支部书记是“料框子二少爷”，因为这个团支书整天穿着毛料子衣服晃来晃去不做实际工作。他们叫他们的材料员是“甩手大少爷”，这些人不是在办公室“稳坐龙墩”，就是“你扛材料前边走，他甩手在后边跟。”
    包头市党代大会立即作出决议，在全市发动一个集中力量反掉官气的运动。作出决议后的第二天，市委书记、市长和各单位的负责人，即分别到工地、车间、商店门市部等地，向工人拜师傅，当徒弟，参加劳动，学习技术。两三天里，全市和工人同劳动同生活的各级领导干部就达到两千多人。华北包头建筑公司由党委书记吕文山带头，有八百多名干部从宿舍大楼搬到工棚去住。工人见了乐得跳起来，抢干部的铺盖卷，争着要干部到本组去。这些干部一住到工棚里，晚上就和工人谈心，早晨起来后和工人一起打水，生火，扫地，上班后和工人一起劳动。
    领导人员下去以后，就越发认识到自己的官气严重。华建三处的双反展览会上，就有干部的官僚主义自画像。其中有一张画着两个人，一个在拍桌子训人，另一个是被训者，头上汗水四溅。党委书记李圈普，向前去参观的市委第一书记苏谦益同志介绍说：这个训人的就是我，我就有这种官气。
    要彻底反掉官气，光是领导干部一般地参加劳动，接受群众的监督和批评还不够。因此，中共包头市委又提出了干部要在改变作风的基础上种“试验田”。
    包钢第一工程公司一队的干部到小组作政治工作，在劳动里组织跃进，是一种较好的办法。干部到小组后要做四件事情：一、拜师傅、当徒弟，老老实实地和工人一起干；二、同工人谈心交朋友，宣传党的政策；三、虚心听取工人意见，发现问题，及时帮助解决；四、帮小组制定跃进计划，给其他小组作出榜样，以点带面。职能人员也全部走出办公室，送料上门，到场服务。他们这样作的结果，不到十天工夫，就收到很大的成效，不仅进一步密切了干部和工人的关系，而且把政治工作和组织工作结合起来，过去许多长期解决不了的问题这次都解决了。
    随着反对官气而来的是生产、文化建设大跃进的高潮。现在，中央在包头的六大国营企业和几十个地方国营工业企业以及文教卫生等部门，不仅都制定跃进规划，而且在为这个规划的实现而苦干，实干。到3月28日止，全市有二十多个国营和地方国营工矿企业超额完成了第一季度生产计划。正在白云鄂博铁矿山施工的职工，在展开打官气运动以后，干部和技术人员冒着八级大风参加劳动，出勤率达到100％，超额50％完成了3月份的月计划。在有二十多万人口的河东区，从3月15到17日，就成立了一个民办初中班，十六个民办初小班，使全区二十二名未升学的高小毕业生和八百零二名适龄儿童全部入了学。接着又组织一万三千多青壮年文盲参加了业余文化学习。
    包头市这半个月的变化，顶过去平常时期的半年、一年，也许根本无法比拟。但这仅仅是开始，在这个基础上，不断努力，将会获得更大的成就。
