Actively Eliminate the Four Pests
Hunan Proposes Ten Measures

(Dispatch from this newspaper) From April 7th to 9th, Hunan Province held a Four Pests Elimination and Hygiene Campaign Great Leap Forward Conference. Responsible comrades from the patriotic health movement committees of various special zones (autonomous prefectures), cities, and relevant departments attended the conference. In order to quickly eliminate the four pests, the conference decided to carry out ten major hygiene reforms throughout the province.

These ten measures are: 1. Improve residential hygiene. Sweep three times a day, separate humans and livestock, move urine buckets out of the house, and keep cesspools ten zhang away from the house, covered and sealed. 2. Improve toilets and manure pits, using three-in-one soil to build the ground, preventing leaks and seepage, covered and sealed. 3. Improve pig and cattle pens, using three-in-one soil to build the ground inside the pens, open windows for lighting, build manure pits outside the pens, covered and sealed. 4. Improve drinking water hygiene, advocate digging wells, change from using pond water to well water, divide river water into sections, the upper reaches as drinking water areas, and establish water collection docks, with downstream for berthing and ferrying. 5. Advocate smokeless two-purpose stoves, and do not use firewood pits. 6. Utilize biogas, implement composting and沤肥, and do not use fresh manure on the land. 7. Improve food hygiene, do not drink raw water, do not eat raw fish or raw meat, do not eat spoiled food or diseased livestock; advocate using serving chopsticks, wash hands before meals and after using the toilet. 8. Improve personal and public hygiene, do not spit everywhere, wash frequently, change clothes frequently, get haircuts frequently, trim nails frequently, do not urinate or defecate everywhere, do not pour sewage and garbage everywhere, do not litter fruit peels and scraps of paper, advocate brushing teeth, and do not share towels. 9. Break down superstitions. Prevent illness without illness, seek medical attention when sick. 10. Promote new methods of childbirth, new methods of childcare, and advocate planned birth control.

At the meeting, the person in charge of the Provincial Health Department particularly pointed out that the key to eliminating the four pests lies in May and June of this year. All localities should further mobilize the masses, actively implement the ten hygiene reform measures, and adopt a combination of fundamental and stopgap measures to achieve quick results and eliminate the four pests as soon as possible. At the same time, it was pointed out that units that have basically eliminated the four pests cannot be paralyzed and must continue to check and continuously replenish the effort. During the movement, all localities should strengthen technical guidance and vigorously promote the experience and creativity of the masses. At the same time, the work of eliminating the four pests should also be combined with other health work, and diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, filariasis, and hookworm disease should be eliminated as soon as possible.
