	Random Gleanings
	Paper Mill Makes Rayon
	The Hangzhou Hua Feng Paper Mill recently succeeded in trial-producing rayon.
	What the factory has successfully trial-produced this time is viscose rayon. It is made from pulp made from coniferous trees or moso bamboo shoots, which is chemically treated to become a viscous colloidal liquid, and then spun into rayon by machine. The cost of this artificial fiber is low, less than a quarter of that of silk. The raw material supply for this artificial fiber is abundant, and it has great development prospects. The factory has decided to start production before August 1 and produce 15 tons within the year.
	Hemp Husk Makes Fluff
	Huang Junshan, a handicraft worker in Wuhan, successfully trial-produced white and soft hemp husk fluff using hemp husks.
	The hemp husks left over after farmers peel ramie can be washed to remove dirt and then the useful fibers can be extracted. This fiber is boiled to remove the glue, then bleached and softened, and then dried and fluffed to become white hemp fluff. Hemp fluff is as warm as cotton; it can be colored (dyed) like cotton; and its toughness and elasticity are four times greater than cotton. If mixed with a portion of cotton, it can be spun into 32-count yarn, or it can be used as cotton wadding. (Xiao Xiangzheng)
	Rice Straw Brewing
	The Liling County Rice General Factory in Hunan Province recently successfully trial-produced wine using rice straw. Every 70 jin of rice straw powder can produce 8 jin 10 liang of 47.2-proof white wine, and the lees can also be used as pig feed.
	Now Liling, Xiangtan, Changsha, Ningxiang, Yueyang, Pingjiang, Liuyang, Linxiang and other counties have decided to establish rice straw wineries, with a planned annual production of 3 million jin of rice straw wine. (Xinhua News Agency)
	Extensive Use of Solar Energy
	The Gansu Provincial Local Science Research Institute is preparing to sign research and production contracts for solar mechanical equipment with the Lanzhou Industrial School, the Lanzhou Machine Manufacturing and Distribution Factory, and relevant scientific research departments and institutions of higher learning, and will produce some solar water heaters, household solar stoves, small water heaters, and set up solar bathrooms in April and May. The first batch of solar equipment produced will be supplied first to the two major irrigation projects in Gansu Province, diverting the Tao River and diverting the Datong River water, to meet the needs of the construction site workers for drinking water, cooking, and other water uses.
	Gansu Province has many sunny days and few rainy days; at the same time, there is a shortage of fuel in rural areas, and stalks, weeds, and animal manure are mostly used for cooking and boiling water. Using solar energy to serve the people can save a lot of fuel.

    造纸厂制人造丝
    杭州市华丰造纸厂最近试制人造丝获得成功。
    这个厂这次试制成功的是粘胶人造丝。它是用针叶树或毛笋壳所做的浆，经过化学处理，成为粘性的胶状液体，然后再经机器喷制成人造丝。这种人造纤维的成本低廉，还不及蚕丝的四分之一。这种人造纤维的原料供应充沛，大有发展前途，这个厂决定在8月1日前即开始生产，年内生产出十五吨。
    麻壳制绒
    武汉市手工业劳动者黄俊三用麻壳试制成功洁白柔软的麻壳绒。
    农民剥取苎麻剩下的麻壳，经过洗涤除垢，就可以提炼有用的纤维。这种纤维经过煮沸脱胶，再经漂白制软，然后烘干、弹松，就成了洁白的麻绒。麻绒保暖和棉花一样；着色（染色）和棉花一样；韧性和弹性比棉花大四倍。如果混合一部分棉花可纺成三十二支纱，也可以作棉絮用。　（萧襄政）
    稻草酿酒
    湖南省醴陵县大米总厂最近试用稻草酿酒成功。每七十斤稻草粉能出四十七度二的白酒八斤十两，酒糟还可作喂猪饲料。
    现在醴陵、湘潭、长沙、宁乡、岳阳、平江、浏阳、临湘等县已决定建立稻草酿酒厂，全年计划生产稻草酒三百万斤。　（新华社）
    广泛利用太阳能
    甘肃省地方科学研究所已准备同兰州工业学校、兰州机器制配厂和有关科学研究部门、高等院校等订立太阳能机械的研究和生产合同，并在4、5月份生产部分太阳能沸水器、家庭太阳能灶、小型热水器和设置太阳能浴室。第一批生产出来的太阳能器械，将首先供应甘肃省引洮河和引大通河水两大灌溉工程，满足工地群众饮水、煮饭和其他用水等需要。
    甘肃省晴天多、雨天少；同时农村燃料较缺乏，做饭，烧水多用秸秆、野草、畜粪等。利用太阳能为人们服务，就可以节约大量燃料。
