Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 22nd April. The Balin Left Banner Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Zhaowuda League of Inner Mongolia has recently successfully trial-produced artificial cotton using rice straw. Its fibers are more than 1.2 inches long and have a good color. It can be used to weave knitted goods such as towels, socks, and blankets, and can also be used as wadding.

Cotton is extremely scarce in Inner Mongolia. The successful trial production of artificial cotton will greatly help solve the clothing problems of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region.

    新华社呼和浩特22日电内蒙古昭乌达盟巴林左旗供销社最近也用稻草试制成功人造棉。它的纤维长一寸二分以上，色泽较好，能纺织毛巾、袜子和毯子等针织品，还可以用来做棉絮。
    内蒙古棉花极为稀少，人造棉花的试制成功，对解决自治区各族人民的衣着问题将有很大作用。
