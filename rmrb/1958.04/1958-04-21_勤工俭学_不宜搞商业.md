    "Work-Study" Should Not Engage in Commerce
    Recently, a group of "small merchants" has appeared on the streets of Changchun. Some of them are holding shoe brushes and masks, while others are carrying soy sauce and pickles, hawking everywhere. This is because some primary schools have organized primary school students to engage in these commercial activities in order to implement the "work-study" policy. My opinion is that this approach has more disadvantages than advantages. First, this approach not only fails to educate primary school students to love labor, but to some extent will foster the idea of simply pursuing economic interests. Moreover, if the goods are not sold for a while or are lost or make mistakes, it will also add a heavy burden to the children's young minds, thus affecting their studies. Second, doing business is a relatively complicated matter, and schools have no experience in this area. If it is not done well, not only will it not make money, but it will also cause losses, thereby increasing the burden on the school. Third, this approach sometimes affects market management and has a bad impact on social order.
    In addition, I feel that this approach is not entirely in line with the "work-study" policy. The purpose of implementing "work-study" is not only to save the country a little money, but more importantly, to closely integrate education and labor through the implementation of this policy, so that the educated can develop in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education, thereby cultivating knowledgeable intellectuals who are both red and expert. From this point of view, it is not appropriate to adopt the approach of simply pursuing economic interests and letting students engage in commercial sales in carrying out "work-study" activities.　Mu Lin

### “勤工俭学”不宜搞商业

    “勤工俭学”不宜搞商业
    最近在长春市街头上出现了一批“小商人”，他们有的拿着鞋刷、口罩，有的端着酱油、咸菜到处叫卖。这是某些小学校为了贯彻“勤工俭学”方针而组织小学生从事这些商业活动的。我的意见是：这种做法利少弊多。第一，这种做法非但对小学生起不到热爱劳动的教育，反而在某种程度上会助长小学生单纯追求经济利益的思想，而且有时商品一时售不出去或者发生丢失、差错，也会给孩子们的幼小心灵上增加沉重的负担，从而影响学习。第二，搞商业是一件比较复杂的事情，学校在这方面是没有经验的，做不好，不仅不能赚钱，而且还会造成赔钱，从而给学校增加负担。第三，这样做，有时也影响市场管理，在社会秩序上也影响不好。
    此外，我觉得这种做法和“勤工俭学”的方针也不完全吻合。实行“勤工俭学”的目的，不仅要为国家节省一点资金，更重要的还在于通过这个方针的实施，使教育和劳动密切结合起来，使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都能得到发展，从而培养出又红又专的知识分子。由此看来，在开展“勤工俭学”的活动上，采取单纯追求经济利益，让学生们从事商业贩卖的这种做法是不适宜的。　穆麟
