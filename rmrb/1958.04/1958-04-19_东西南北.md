    Haining Rural Electric Lights Form a Fiery Dragon
    The electric irrigation network in Haining County, Zhejiang Province, has been fully completed. This electric irrigation network can free 80% of the county's farmland, totaling 460,000 mu, from the threat of drought. Among these, more than 60,000 mu will be transformed from dry land into irrigated land or paddy fields.
    In recent days, the vast majority of electric motors in the electric irrigation network have been used for pumping water to accumulate fertilizer. At night, electric lights in many villages form fiery dragons, illuminating the commune members' production activities.
    Qinghai Tames Wild Animals
    Various areas of Qinghai Province are capturing wild animals in preparation for taming and utilizing them. Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture all plan to establish deer farms, musk deer farms, wild goose farms, wild duck farms, wild crane farms, etc., this year to domesticate wild animals. According to extremely incomplete statistics, there are approximately forty to fifty species of wild animals and birds in the province. Among them, deer, musk deer, lynx, marmots, snow leopards, clouded leopards, leopard cats, flying squirrels, wild geese, wild ducks, etc., have significant economic value.
    Rural Shower Rooms
    Production teams in all agricultural cooperatives in Heping Township, Wushan County, Gansu Province, have set up shower rooms.
    These shower rooms consist of an earthenware jar filled with warm water, suspended from the roof beam. A drainage hole is drilled in the bottom of the jar. When in use, the plug is removed from the drainage hole, and the warm water flows down from above, allowing for a refreshing shower. Building such a shower room costs only a little over one yuan. On the first day that the six shower rooms in Zhongping First Cooperative were completed, forty-eight commune members took showers. The commune members all said: "This is a good method that is both economical and hygienic."

    海宁农村电灯组成火龙
    浙江省海宁县的电力灌溉网已经全部建成。这个电力灌溉网可以使全县80％的农田共四十六万亩摆脱干旱威胁，其中有六万多亩由旱地变成水浇地或水田。
    这几天来，电力灌溉网的绝大部分电动机已经被利用为抽水积肥服务。晚上，很多乡村里电灯组成一条条火龙，照耀着社员们搞生产。
    青海驯养野生动物
    青海省各地正在捕捉野生动物，准备加以驯养和利用。玉树藏族自治州、果洛藏族自治州、海南藏族自治州和海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州，今年都计划建立养鹿场、麝场、野鹅场、野鸭场、野鹤场等，来驯养野生动物。据极不完全的统计，全省约有野生禽兽四、五十种。其中如鹿、麝、扫雪、猞猁、旱獭、雪豹、云豹、艾虎、飞鼠、野鹅、野鸭等，经济利用价值都很大。
    农村淋浴室
    甘肃武山县和平乡各农业社的生产队都设了淋浴室。
    这种淋浴室是把一个装有温水的瓦罐吊在房梁上，罐底钻一个排水孔，用时将排水孔的塞子拿掉，温水自上流下，就可以痛快地洗澡。修建一个这样的淋浴室，只需一元多钱。当中坪一社六个淋浴室建成的第一天，就有四十八个社员洗了澡。社员们都说：“这是既节约又讲卫生的好办法。”
