Jiangxi Carries Out Comprehensive Inspection and Evaluation to Promote Production
Hubei Xiaogan Prefecture Inspects Rice Seedling Management

(Our report) Last month, Jiangxi Province launched a massive inspection and evaluation campaign to prepare for spring plowing. From the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee down to every member of the agricultural cooperatives, everyone was involved in this great inspection and evaluation movement. Inspectors visited the sites first and then conducted evaluations. They went to every village, assessed every cooperative, and drew conclusions for every township, with an extremely serious and responsible attitude. The forms of commendation and criticism were also extremely vivid, lively, novel, and diverse. There were red flag awards, written notices; there were popular and well-received big-character posters, rhymes, mountain songs, and clapper talks; and there were also on-the-spot delivery of good news reports and encouraging signs. Ganxian, Xingguo, Nanchang, Ruichang and other counties won the honorary title of "Red Flag of Excellence" or "Excellent County" in their respective areas due to their outstanding production achievements. The list of advanced units and individuals was published in the county newspapers or other publications in various places. After the inspection and evaluation, various localities promptly announced the second inspection and evaluation competition centered on rice transplanting.

The inspection and evaluation vigorously promoted spring plowing. For example, in Taishan Township, Anyi County, during the inspection and evaluation, more than 30 fast clappers and rhymes were compiled based on more than 30 good and bad typical examples, and posted in big-character posters. The big-character poster for the Sixth Group of Yanghu Cooperative read: "The Sixth Group of the back room is really bad, the new-style seedling field is six feet wide. The government calls for innovation, but their thinking is not clear. ..." After the big-character poster was posted, not only did the criticized teams and groups take practical actions to correct themselves in time, but it also educated other production teams and groups. For example, the Maple Tree Team had not cleaned up many rice roots when they sowed 1.2 acres of seedling fields on the first day. After hearing that the Sixth Group of the back room was criticized, they immediately mobilized women to pull out and level the rice roots. Through inspection and evaluation in the Ji'an Special Zone, more than 800,000 people in the entire zone were busy with production day and night. Suichuan County in this special zone has been short of plowing cattle for years. This year, with the realization of double cropping, there is a greater shortage of plowing cattle. Under the promotion of inspection and evaluation, various cooperatives have come up with ways to advance spring plowing, which solved the problem of shortage of cattle.

During the on-site inspection and evaluation process, cadres and the masses received the most profound and realistic education, broke down conservative thinking, and overcame complacency.

(Our report) Early rice sowing in Xiaogan Special Zone, Hubei Province, has basically ended, five to seven days earlier than last year. At present, all localities are conducting a comprehensive inspection of the quality of seedling transplanting and the management of seedling fields.

This year, in Xiaogan Special Zone, the area of early rice seedling fields has increased by more than 700,000 mu compared with last year. In addition, with the implementation of the technical measures of sparse sowing and strong seedlings, the area of early rice seedling fields has increased by nearly 100,000 mu compared with last year. During the seedling transplanting period, all localities, taking the district or township as a unit, organized township and community cadres to conduct comprehensive inspections. Most areas went to every community, every team, and every plot. According to the inspection results, the preparation and sowing quality of this year's seedling fields are relatively good, and the early seedlings are growing very well. No rotten seedlings or inverted buds have been found yet. When the fifteen teams of Liming Cooperative in Xiaogan Station Township inspected, they found that the seedling transplanting quality of two teams and two plots of land was poor. They immediately helped to study remedial measures. Liaoyuan Cooperative of Daluxiang Township in Tongshan did not follow the original sowing plan and wanted to reduce the sowing area of ​​early rice, so they soaked 1,500 catties less of early rice seeds. After inspection, the masses were mobilized to debate, which resolved the conservative thinking of cadres and the masses who were unwilling to plant double-cropped rice. Measures were immediately taken to heat and soak the seeds to promote germination and sowing in the fields.

    江西全面检查评比推动生产
    湖北孝感专区检查秧田管理工作
    本报讯　上个月，江西省开展了一个千军万马的备耕生产大检查评比运动。上自省委第一书记，下至每一个农业社社员，都卷进了这个大检查评比运动。检查人员都是先到现场参观，然后评比。他们村村走到，社社鉴定，乡乡结论，态度极为严肃认真。表扬、批评的形式也极为生动、活泼、新颖和多样。有红旗奖励、书面通报；有群众喜闻乐见的大字报、顺口溜、山歌和快板；还有当场送喜报、鼓动牌。赣县、兴国、南昌、瑞昌等县都以生产成绩优异，获得了各该片的优胜红旗或优胜县的光荣称号。先进的单位和个人名单都在各县的县报或其他刊物上公布了。各地在检查评比结束后，又及时宣布了以插秧为中心的第二次检查评比竞赛。
    检查评比有力地推动了春耕生产。像安义县台山乡在检查评比中，针对三十多个好坏典型，编成三十多个快板、顺口溜，用大字报贴出。给阳湖社第六组的大字报是：“后房六组真是差，新式秧田宽六尺。政府号召要革新，他们思想没弄通。……”大字报贴出后，不但被批评的队、组采取实际行动，及时改正，而且还教育了其他生产队、组。如枫树队头日播种一亩二分秧田，有不少禾兜没有检净，听说后房六组挨了批评，当日就发动妇女把禾兜箝出整平。吉安专区通过检查评比，全区八十多万人日夜忙生产。这个专区的遂川县历年缺耕牛，今年实现双季化更感耕牛不足，在检查评比推动下，各社想出了提早春耕的办法，解决了缺牛的困难。
    在现场检查评比过程中，干部和群众受到了一次最深刻最现实的教育，打破了保守思想，克服了自满情绪。
    本报讯　湖北孝感专区早稻播种已基本结束，比去年提早五天到七天。目前各地对下秧质量和秧田管理工作，正在进行全面检查。
    孝感专区今年由于早稻秧田比去年扩大七十多万亩，加上贯彻稀播壮秧的技术措施，早稻秧田比去年扩大近十万亩。在下秧期间，各地都以区或乡为单位，组织乡社干部进行全面检查，大部分地区都是社社走到、队队走到、丘丘看到。根据检查结果，今年的秧田整理和播种质量都比较好，早期秧长得很好，还未发现烂秧和倒芽现象。孝感车站乡黎明社十五个队检查时，有两个队两丘田下秧质量较差，当即帮助研究出补救办法。通山大路乡燎原社没有按照原订播种计划，想缩小早稻播种面积，少浸了一千五百斤早稻种。经过检查，发动群众辩论，解决了干部和群众不愿种双季稻的保守思想，当即采取加温浸种催芽的办法，播种到田。
