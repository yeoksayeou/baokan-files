Xinhua News Agency, April 29th dispatch from London via TASS: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party recently wrote to the committees of various local parties explaining its decision not to send a delegation to the Congress of the Yugoslav Communist League in Ljubljana. The letter stated that some of the formulations in the section on international relations in the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League have many contradictions with the program of the British Communist Party, and it would be simply impossible not to criticize these formulations at the Congress. Since the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party did not consider this correct, it decided not to send a delegation.

The letter pointed out that the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League does not analyze the policies of US imperialism or its role in the current international situation, but the pamphlet "The British Road to Socialism" emphasized that the current danger of war is still due to imperialist plots of aggression against socialist countries.

Yugoslavia's analysis of international tensions also contradicts the peace declaration adopted by sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties in November last year, which the League of Communists of Yugoslavia also signed.

The letter also quoted certain excerpts from the draft program of the Yugoslav Communist League and compared these excerpts with the analysis made in the pamphlet "The British Road to Socialism." The letter continued: "Therefore, despite our own wishes, we can only come to the conclusion that the Yugoslav Communist League has ignored the basic contradiction in the world—the contradiction between the imperialist system and the socialist system."

Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: According to the Soviet "Pravda," the Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità" recently published an article commenting on Tito's report at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The title of the article is: "Tito's Statement on the Reasons for the Division of the World into Blocs is Unacceptable."

"Unità" particularly criticized Tito for "only considering the Marshall Plan as a form of economic assistance" and "to prevent possible political crises in Western Europe." In addition, "Unità" also criticized Tito's statement that "Stalin's irreconcilable policy" led to the isolation of the Soviet Union and weakened its "position in the world."

At the same time, "Unità" pointed out Tito's positive stance on the Soviet Union's decision to stop atomic weapons testing.

    南共纲领草案抹煞了世界基本矛盾
    英共执委会认为它同英共纲领有许多出入
    “团结报”说不能接受铁托关于集团的说法
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党执行委员会不久以前写信给各地方党的委员会说明它决定不派代表团参加在卢布尔雅那举行的南共代表大会的理由。信中说，南共纲领草案涉及国际关系部分的一些提法同英共纲领有许多矛盾之处，不在代表大会上批评这些提法简直是不可能的。既然英共执行委员会不认为这是正确的，所以它决定不派遣代表团。
    这封信指出，南共纲领草案没有分析美帝国主义的政策或者它在当前国际局势中的作用，可是“英国走向社会主义的道路”这本小册子却强调指出过，当前的战争危险仍然是由于帝国主义对社会主义国家的侵略阴谋。
    南斯拉夫对国际紧张局势的分析也同去年11月六十四个共产党和工人党通过的和平宣言相矛盾，而南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟也曾在宣言上签了字。
    信中还引述了南共纲领草案的某些片段，并且把这些片段同“英国走向社会主义的道路”这本小册子中所作的分析作了对比。信中接着说：“因此，尽管违反自己的意愿，可是我们也只能得出这样一个结论：南共忽视了世界上的基本矛盾——帝国主义体系和社会主义体系之间的矛盾”。
    新华社29日讯　据苏联“真理报”载，意大利共产党机关报“团结报”最近发表文章评论了铁托在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会上的报告。文章的标题是：“铁托关于世界分裂成为集团的原因的声明是不能接受的”。
    “团结报”特别指责铁托“只认为马歇尔计划是经济援助的一种方式”，“是为了防止西欧可能发生的政治危机”。此外，“团结报”还指责了铁托的这样一种说法：“斯大林的不调和的政策”导致了苏联的孤立并削弱了它“在世界上的地位”。
    同时，“团结报”指出了铁托对苏联关于停止原子武器试验的决定所采取的良好立场。
