Gansu's Drought Resistance Struggle Achieves Three Major Victories: Spring Wheat Sowing Completed, Winter Wheat Adequately Watered and Fertilized, Great Enthusiasm for Water Conservancy Construction

    (Our report) Gansu province farmers have achieved three major victories this year on the drought resistance front: first, the successful completion of sowing more than ten million mu of spring wheat; second, the maintenance of more than ten million mu of winter wheat, resulting in green leaves and strong seedlings; and third, the newly constructed irrigation of more than eight million mu of land.

    Although the spring wheat sowing in Gansu Province was carried out under severe drought conditions from beginning to end, inspections show that the quality of the sowing is good. In Dingxi Prefecture, the area most severely affected by drought, only the quality of sowing in Jingyuan and three other counties was relatively poor, but even in these four counties, only about 3% of the germination and emergence were poor. The sixteen types of drought-resistant sowing methods summarized by this prefecture in a timely manner for drought resistance have basically ensured the smooth progress of sowing work throughout the area. Tongwei County originally had 320,000 mu of dry land that could not be sown. In the process of sowing, the masses created a water drill, with one person and one animal able to sow four mu per day, solving the problem of the county's inability to sow due to drought.

    Pingliang Prefecture is the main winter wheat producing area of Gansu, with its winter wheat area accounting for almost half of the province's total. Although it has also been dry here since the beginning of spring, due to sufficient water and fertilizer, the seedlings are strong, and 90% of the first and second-class wheat fields are still guaranteed to be harvested. Now the people of the entire region are irrigating, topdressing, weeding, and replanting in the third-class wheat fields. The people of Qingyang broke the long-standing convention of "only allowing water to enter, not allowing water to leave the door," mobilized more than 70,000 laborers, carried the drinking water from their wells and cellars out of their homes, and irrigated more than 23,000 mu of wheat fields.

    The more severe the drought, the greater the enthusiasm of the people of Gansu for water conservancy construction. This year, they have constructed irrigation for more than eight million mu of land, accounting for 88% of the annual plan (revised plan), which is more than the land irrigated in the several thousand years before liberation. In order to combat drought, they have also paid attention to irrigating the newly constructed irrigated land as it is being built. (Wang Tiqiang, Wang Dewen)

    甘肃抗旱斗争取得三大胜利
    春小麦播种完成　冬小麦水足粪饱　兴修水利劲头很大
    本报讯　甘肃省农民今年在抗旱战线上取得了三大胜利：一是胜利地完成了一千多万亩春小麦播种，二是把一千多万亩冬小麦维护得叶绿苗壮，三是新修了八百多万亩水地。
    甘肃省的春小麦播种从开始到结束虽然都是在旱象严重情况下进行的，但据检查，播种的质量还好。旱象最严重的定西专区，只有靖远等四个县的质量较差，但这四个县发芽及出苗不良的也不过占3％左右。这个专区为抗旱而及时总结出的十六种抗旱播种办法，基本上保证了全区播种工作的顺利进行。通渭县原有三十二万亩旱地不能下种，群众在播种中创造了一种水耧，一人一畜每天能播种四亩，把这个县因旱不能下种的问题解决了。
    平凉专区是甘肃的冬小麦主要产区，今年的冬小麦面积几乎达全省的一半。这里入春以来虽然也是干旱，但因水足粪饱苗儿壮，一、二类保收麦田仍达90％。现在全区人民正在三类麦田里灌水、追肥、锄草和补种。庆阳人民打破了“只许水进门，不许水出门”的多年常规，动员了七万多劳动力，把人吃的井窖水担出家门，使二万三千多亩麦地都浇了一遍。
    甘肃人民在干旱越严重时，兴修水利的劲头越足。他们今年已兴修了水地八百多万亩，为年计划（修改后的计划）的88％，比解放前几千年兴修的水地还多。为了抗旱，他们还注意了新修水地随修随灌。　　（王体强、王得温）
