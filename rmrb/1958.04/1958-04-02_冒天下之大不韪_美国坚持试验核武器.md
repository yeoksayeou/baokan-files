    Defying World Opinion
    The United States Persists in Testing Nuclear Weapons
    Xinhua News Agency, April 1st—Washington Dispatch: State Department spokesman White announced on March 31st that the United States, disregarding the Soviet Union's announcement that it had ceased atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, would still proceed with its scheduled nuclear weapon tests to be conducted this spring and summer.
    U.S. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles held a seventy-minute meeting on the same day regarding the Soviet statement. The State Department also issued a formal statement on this day, attempting to downplay the tremendous significance of the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease atomic and hydrogen weapon testing.
    In order to mitigate the enormous impact of the Soviet decision, the State Department deliberately cast doubt on the sincerity of the Soviet Union's intention to resolve the disarmament issue, stating that there was "no verification system" to confirm the Soviet decision, and demanded that so-called "free nations" should not "abandon" following the U.S.'s arms expansion and war preparations "because of trusting the Soviet Union's intentions."
    Associated Press commentator Ryan's commentary on March 31st reflected the United States' helpless predicament regarding the Soviet decision. He said, "For almost a week, U.S. policymakers have been waiting for this blow to fall." Ryan also believed that the Soviet decision would have a tremendous impact on Asian and African countries.

### 冒天下之大不韪  美国坚持试验核武器

    冒天下之大不韪
    美国坚持试验核武器
    新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：国务院发言人怀特3月31日宣布，美国将不顾苏联已经宣布停止原子武器和氢武器试验，而仍然要进行它预定在今年春季和夏季举行的核武器试验。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯同一天就苏联的声明举行了七十分钟的会谈。国务院在这一天也发表正式声明，竭力贬低苏联决定单独停止原子武器和氢武器试验一事的巨大意义。
    为了缓和苏联这个决定将会产生的巨大影响，国务院在声明中故意对苏联的决定所表现出来的谋求解决裁军问题的诚意散布怀疑，说什么“没有查核制度”来证实苏联的决定，并且要求所谓“自由国家”不要“因为信赖苏联的意图”而“放弃”跟随美国扩军备战。
    美联社评论员瑞安31日的一篇评论反映了美国对苏联这一决定的无可奈何的窘境。他说，“差不多一个星期以来，美国决策人就一直在等待这个打击落下来。”瑞安还认为，苏联的这一决定将在亚非国家产生巨大影响。
