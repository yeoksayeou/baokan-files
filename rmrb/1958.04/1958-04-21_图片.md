(Left picture) Unemployed workers parading in the streets with signs indicating their trades (cooks, painters, firefighters, etc.). The words "1 dollar per week" are attached to the hats, indicating that they are willing to accept any job with extremely low pay.

    上面的图片是1929年美国发生经济危机期间的情景。（左图）失业工人挂着标志自己行业（厨师、油漆工人、消防队员等等）的招贴在街头游行。帽子上缀着“每周1元”的字样，表示他们愿意接受报酬极为低微的任何工作。（右图）虎视眈眈的警察监视着街头的失业工人群众。
