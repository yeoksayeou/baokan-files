Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 19th: Nguyen Van Tran, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stated in a report to the National Assembly on the 1958 National Plan on the afternoon of the 19th that the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in North Vietnam would "initially and comprehensively unfold" this year. Furthermore, on the basis of further developing industrial and agricultural production, the material and cultural living standards of the people would continue to be improved, and national defense capabilities would be strengthened.

Nguyen Van Tran said that the total output value of state-owned industries will increase by 53% this year compared to last year, while the total output value of private industries and handicrafts will increase by 9.7%. The proportion of state-owned industries in the total industrial output value will increase from 24.3% to 31%, while the proportion of private industries and handicrafts will decrease from 75.7% to 69%. In terms of commerce, state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives will be consolidated and developed this year, with state-owned retail sales increasing by 36% compared to last year. In agriculture, the number of farmers participating in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives will increase to 60% of the total number of farm households this year.

Nguyen Van Tran said that the total output value of industry, agriculture, and handicrafts in 1958 will reach over 3 trillion yuan, an increase of 10.3% compared to last year. Among this total output value, agriculture accounts for 63.9%, while industry and handicrafts account for 36.1%.

In his report, he emphasized that agricultural production remains the primary economic task this year, with the primary goal of increasing grain production. This year, grain production will reach 4.08 million tons, an increase of 3.3% compared to last year. This year, farmers will also be vigorously encouraged to engage in small and medium-sized water conservancy construction, mobilize farmers to join labor exchange groups, and consolidate state-owned farms.

Nguyen Van Tran particularly emphasized the importance of socialist transformation in his report today. He said: I hope that all private industrialists and businessmen in the North will welcome and be ready to accept this transformation at any time. This remark was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience.

In his report, Nguyen Van Tran also pointed out that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has achieved significant victories in the three years of restoring the national economy, while the economy of South Vietnam under the rule of the United States and Ngo Dinh Diem is increasingly deteriorating. Nguyen Van Tran said that the current grain production in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is nearly 4 million tons, exceeding the highest pre-war production level, while the grain production in South Vietnam, which has more favorable natural conditions than the North, is only over 3.5 million tons, which has not yet reached the pre-war level. The industrial production of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is also developing rapidly, while the important industries in the South are controlled by foreign capital. Under the dumping of foreign goods, one-third of the textile factories have been forced to close, and the number of unemployed workers has reached over 160,000.

Nguyen Van Tran said that the prices of daily necessities such as grain are stable in North Vietnam, while prices in the South are constantly fluctuating. The financial budget of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a budget for peaceful construction, with 61.8% of last year's budget used to restore and develop the economy and culture, while the military and public security expenditures of the Southern regime account for the vast majority of the budget.

He said that with the growth of industrial and agricultural production, the lives of workers and peasants in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have been initially improved, and the real wages of workers have gradually increased. The state's annual agricultural expenditure is more than agricultural tax revenue, and the lives of farmers have been improved. Conversely, in the South, people's purchasing power has decreased by 70% compared to 1954.

In his report, Nguyen Van Tran also gave a brief explanation of the basic principles and tasks of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's three-year plan. He said that the implementation of the three-year plan will prepare for the subsequent five-year plan. In the three years, industrial and agricultural production will be further promoted, and agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce will be initially transformed. Economic development will still focus on agriculture, with particular emphasis on increasing grain production. During this period, the socialist transformation of agriculture will mainly be in the form of lower-level agricultural cooperatives.

    越南恢复国民经济取得重大胜利
    今年开始社会主义三大改造
    新华社河内19日电　越南民主共和国政府国家计划委员会副主任阮文珍19日下午在向国会报告1958年国家计划时指出，今年越南北方对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作将要“初步地全面地展开”，并且在进一步发展工农业生产的基础上继续提高人民物质、文化生活水平，加强国防力量。
    阮文珍说，今年国营工业总产值将比去年增长53％，私营工业和手工业总产值增长9.7％。国营工业在工业总产值中所占比重，将从24.3％增加到31％，而私营工业和手工业产值的比重，将从过去的75.7％下降到69％。商业方面，今年要巩固和发展国营商业和供销合作社，使国营零售额比去年增长36％。农业方面，在今年内参加互助组和农业生产合作社的农户，要增加到农户总数的60％。
    阮文珍说，1958年的工农业和手工业总产值将达到三万多亿元，比去年增长10.3％，在这项总产值中，农业占63.9％，工业和手工业占36.1％。
    他在报告中强调说，农业生产仍然是今年首要的经济任务，首先设法提高粮食产量。今年谷物产量将达到四百零八万吨，比去年增长3.3％。今年还将大力鼓励农民搞中小型水利建设，发动农民加入变工组和巩固国营农场。
    阮文珍在今天的报告中特别强调社会主义改造的重要性。他说：我希望北方所有的私营工商业者能够欢迎和随时准备接受这种改造。他的这番话受到全场的热烈鼓掌。
    阮文珍在报告中还指出，越南民主共和国在恢复国民经济的三年中，已经取得了重大胜利，而在美国和吴庭艳统治下的越南南方的经济却日益衰退。阮文珍说，目前越南民主共和国的粮食产量将近四百万吨，超过了战前的最高产量水平，而自然条件比北方更有利的越南南方的谷物产量却只有三百五十多万吨，还没有达到战前水平。越南民主共和国的工业生产也日益发展，而南方的重要工业则为外国资本所控制。在外货倾销下，三分之一的纺织厂被迫关门，失业工人达十六万人以上。
    阮文珍说，目前越南北方粮食等生活必需品价格稳定，南方的物价却不断波动。越南民主共和国的财政预算是和平建设的预算，去年预算中的61.8％用来恢复和发展经济和文化，而南方政权的军事和公安方面的支出却占预算的绝大部分。
    他说，随着工农业生产的增长，越南民主共和国工农群众的生活得到初步的改善，工人的实际工资逐渐增加。国家每年的农业支出比农业税还要多，农民的生活得到改善。相反，在南方，人民购买力比1954年降低了70％。
    阮文珍在报告中还就越南民主共和国今后三年计划的基本方针和任务作了扼要的说明。他说，三年计划的实现，将为以后的五年计划作好准备。三年中要进一步促进工农业生产，初步改造农业、手工业和资本主义工商业。发展经济方面仍以农业为主，特别着重提高粮食产量。在这期间的农业社会主义改造，以低级农业合作社形式为主。
