Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 2nd: A grease chemical cooperative in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, with only ten members, has successfully test-refined artificial petroleum from coal tar. On the afternoon of March 31st, the heads of the Henan Provincial Department of Commerce, Department of Transportation, and Zhengzhou Petroleum Company rode in a truck fueled by artificial petroleum to assess it. After a long trip, it was proven that the artificial petroleum performed well.

Coal tar is a byproduct of the coking industry. Facts have proven that more than 80% of petroleum can be extracted from coal tar, which in the past could only be mixed into asphalt for road repair. In late March, the Zhengzhou Grease Chemical Cooperative, which specializes in cleaning waste oil, spent more than 200 yuan to buy 3,000 jin of coal tar. They cleaned it once with sulfuric acid and caustic soda, then refined it. After refining it once, they cleaned it again with sulfuric acid and caustic soda. As a result, they extracted 45 jin of gasoline, 450 jin of kerosene, 900 jin of light diesel, 600 jin of heavy diesel, and 450 jin of lubricating oil, totaling 2,445 jin.

Henan Province is rich in coal tar resources. The province has decided to make the construction of an artificial petroleum industry an important project for developing local industry this year, striving to refine 20,000 tons of artificial petroleum this year.

    河南一个小手工业社
    炼成人造石油
    据新华社郑州2日电　郑州市一个只有十名社员的油脂化学社，从煤焦油中试炼人造石油成功。3月31日下午，河南省商业厅、交通厅和郑州市石油公司的负责人，乘坐在以人造石油为燃料的卡车里，给人造石油作鉴定，经过长途行车，证明人造石油效能良好。
    煤焦油是炼焦工业的副产品。事实证明，从过去只能掺入沥青里修马路的煤焦油中，可以提炼出80％以上的石油来。3月下旬，以清理废油为业的郑州市油脂化学社，花了两百多元钱买来了三千斤煤焦油，用硫酸、火碱清理一遍再提炼，提炼一遍再用硫酸、火碱清理，结果提炼出汽油四十五斤、煤油四百五十斤、轻柴油九百斤、重柴油六百斤、润滑油四百五十斤，共计二千四百四十五斤。
    河南省煤焦油原料丰富，省里确定把建设人造石油工业作为今年发展地方工业的一个重要项目，争取今年能炼出人造石油二万吨。
