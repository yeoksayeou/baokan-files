    Old Red Capital Ruijin: Everyone Studies
    300 Private Schools Established in Six Days
    (Reported by our newspaper) Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the old Red capital of Ruijin established 301 primary schools from March 30th to April 4th in six days without spending a penny of state money. The number of children enrolled reached 10,075. Together with the original 25,500 primary school students, the number of children enrolled already accounts for 98% of all school-age children in the county. This achieved the goal of every commune running schools and everyone studying, popularizing primary school education.
    In late March, the county, in the two townships of Shazhouba and Yeping – the former residence of Chairman Mao – established 35 private primary schools in seven days, popularizing primary school education. Li Zhengji, the First Secretary of the Ruijin County Party Committee, convened a telephone conference of the Party Secretaries of all districts and directly subordinate townships on March 29th, introducing the experience of these two townships. Subsequently, Party organizations at the district and township levels successively convened joint meetings of township and commune cadres, primary school principals, and teachers, fully discussing the guidelines, tasks, and methods of running schools. In this way, a high tide of mass school-running was quickly launched throughout the county.

    六天民办小学三百所
    本报讯　老红都瑞金人民在党的领导下，从3月30日到4月4日六天中，没有花国家一分钱，办起了三百零一所小学，入学儿童达一万零七十五人，加上原在校小学生二万五千五百人，入学儿童已占全县适龄儿童的98％。做到了社社办学，人人念书，普及了小学教育。
    3月下旬，该县就在毛主席的故居——沙洲坝和叶坪两乡，以七天时间，举办了三十五所民办小学，普及了小学教育。中共瑞金县委第一书记李祯绩同志，在3月29日召开了各区和直属乡党委书记电话会议，介绍了这两个乡的经验。接着，各区、乡党组织先后召开了乡、社干部和小学校长、教师联席会议，充分讨论了办学的方针、任务和作法。这样，迅速地在全县范围内掀起了群众办学的高潮。
