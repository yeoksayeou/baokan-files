    Warmongering Madmen Still Creating Countercurrents

    The defense ministers of the fourteen countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held a secret meeting at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris from the 15th to the 17th. What did they discuss during these three days? The communiqué from this meeting shows that they want to spread denser war clouds over the world, especially to accelerate the policy of nuclear armament in Western Europe.

    Peace! Peace! This has become the most urgent cry from the bottom of the hearts of hundreds of millions of people around the world. They demand that East-West negotiations be held quickly to ease international tensions and eliminate the threat of war—especially nuclear war. Under the strong pressure of world public opinion, a small group of warmongers in the United States and other Western countries have had to hypocritically express their willingness to negotiate, and even Dulles has recently tried in several speeches to portray himself as if he were the most peace-loving person of our time. However, the United States and its partners are stepping up their efforts to build missile bases in every corner of the world that can launch nuclear warheads. The United States' plan is that if it cannot stop the holding of East-West talks, it will make the talks face the dangerous situation they have created.

    This meeting of the NATO defense ministers is part of the above-mentioned sinful plan. Before the meeting began, the United States had been carrying out various activities to establish intermediate-range missile bases in Western European countries and to equip the armies of Western European countries with nuclear weapons. Macmillan has agreed to use British territory as a missile launch pad for the United States. Adenauer has also decided to equip the West German army with atomic weapons. At this meeting, the Supreme Commander of the NATO forces, the American General Norstad, again proposed to his Western European partners to double the ground forces of the group, especially to strengthen the armed forces in Central Europe; and more seriously, he demanded that American missile bases be deployed in five or more NATO member states, and that the atomicization of the West German army be approved. According to the communiqué of the meeting, the United States has forced the countries participating in the meeting to accept the "basic strategy" proposed by this crazy American general, which is to expand both conventional forces and step up preparations for nuclear war.

    "Stop thief by the thief" is a deceptive trick commonly used by warmongers. This meeting of the NATO defense ministers was no exception. The communiqué of the meeting insisted that the reason why this military group had to make this decision was only to deal with the Soviet Union's efforts to equip its troops with the latest weapons.

    Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has been actively promoting disarmament with practical actions, and has unilaterally reduced its troops several times, including a reduction of 300,000 troops this year alone. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has withdrawn a large number of troops from East Germany and advocated the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe to reduce the risk of war in the region. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has always advocated the prohibition of the testing and use of nuclear weapons, and has recently unilaterally stopped nuclear weapons testing. The Soviet Union is a strong bulwark of peace, and this is an ironclad fact! Any despicable slander will be shattered in the face of this fact.

    The actions of the people of Western Europe show that they are fully aware of this fact. In Britain, the struggle against the establishment of American missile bases and the demand for a halt to nuclear weapons testing has flourished. In West Germany, demonstrations against atomic armament are surging, and in other countries, the movement for negotiation and against nuclear weapons is also rising and falling like waves. The will of hundreds of millions of people is a huge force for defending peace.

    However, the meeting of the NATO defense ministers is an alarm bell for all peace-loving people: the warmongering madmen are still determined to create countercurrents. To eliminate the war clouds over the world and to get rid of the fatal threat of nuclear destruction, people must strengthen their unity and carry out more vigorous struggles.

    好战的狂人还在制造逆流
    北大西洋集团十四个国家的国防部长从15日到17日在巴黎夏乐宫举行了秘密会议。他们在这三天之中讨论了一些什么呢？这次会议的公报显示，他们要在世界上布起更密的战争乌云，特别是要在西欧加紧推行核备战的政策。
    和平！和平！这已经成为全世界亿万人民从心底里发出来的最迫切的呼声。他们要求赶快举行东西方谈判，来缓和国际紧张局势，消除战争——特别是核战争的威胁。在全世界人民的强大舆论压力下，美国和其它西方国家的一小撮战争贩子虽然不得不假惺惺地表示愿意谈判，甚至像杜勒斯居然在最近的几次演说里还企图把他自己装扮成似乎是当代最爱好和平的人物。但是，美国和它的伙伴们正在加紧进行的却是要在世界各个角落密布下发射核弹头的导弹基地。美国的打算是，如果它没有办法阻挡住东西方会谈的举行，就让会谈面临着他们所造成的险恶局面。
    这次北大西洋集团国防部长会议，就是上述罪恶计划的一部分。在会议开始之前，美国就为在西欧国家建立中程导弹基地和用核武器装备西欧国家的军队进行了种种活动。麦克米伦已经同意把英国的领土当作美国的导弹发射台。阿登纳也决定把西德军队配备原子武装。在这次会议上，北大西洋集团军队总司令、美国将军诺斯塔德又向西欧的伙伴们提出要把这个集团的地面部队增加一倍，特别是加强在中欧的武装力量；而更严重的是，他要求在五个或更多的北大西洋集团成员国中布置美国导弹基地，并且批准使西德的军队原子化。根据会议公报，美国已迫使参加会议的各国接受了这个疯狂的美国将军所提出既扩大常规部队、又加紧准备核战争的“基本战略”。
    “贼喊捉贼”是战争狂人们所惯用的骗人手法。这次北大西洋集团国防部长会议也不例外。会议的公报硬说，这个军事集团之所以要作出这种决定不过是为了对付苏联用最新式武器配备它的部队的努力。
    谁都知道，苏联一直积极用实际行动促成裁军，并且几次单方面裁军，光在今年就一次裁减军队三十万人。谁都知道，苏联已经从民主德国撤出了大量部队，并且主张在中欧建立无原子武器区来减少在这个地区发生战争的危险。谁都知道，苏联历来主张禁止试验和使用核武器，而在最近还单方面停止了核武器试验。苏联是维护和平的坚强堡垒，这是铁一般的事实！任何卑鄙的污蔑在这个事实面前都将碰得粉碎。
    西欧人民的行动，表明他们完全看得清楚这个事实。在英国，反对建立美国导弹基地和要求停止核武器试验的斗争已经蓬勃展开。在西德，反对原子武装的示威正在汹涌而起，在其它国家，要谈判不要核武器运动也像浪涛一样地此起彼伏。亿万人的意志，就是保卫和平的巨大力量。
    但是，北大西洋集团国防部长会议对一切爱好和平的人们说来是一下警钟：好战的狂人们还决心制造逆流。要消除笼罩在世界上的战争乌云，要摆脱核毁灭的致命威胁，人们还必须加强团结，进行更有力的斗争。
