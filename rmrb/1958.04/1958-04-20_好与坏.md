　　Good and Bad

　　The Indonesian government army's recapture of Padang is encouraging good news. But the "New York Daily News" says it is "bad news." It also came out to offer suggestions for the rebels, "hoping" that they would carry out "guerrilla warfare," while advocating that Washington should supply the rebels with large amounts of artillery and ammunition.

　　It is not surprising that the "New York Daily News" openly stands on the side of the rebels and is extremely hostile to the Indonesian people. However, the fact that it still came out to clamor loudly when the rebels were on the verge of collapse tells people one thing: the imperialists are always "reluctant to give up until all hope is lost." As long as there is a single soldier or weapon of the rebel group, they will not stop exploiting it. As long as there is any possibility, they will not give up their aggression. The "New York Daily News" unintentionally told the Indonesian people such a rule, which is good news.

    好与坏
    印度尼西亚政府军收复巴东，这是鼓舞人心的好消息。但是，“纽约每日新闻”却说这是“坏消息”。它并且出来为叛乱分子献策，“希望”他们进行“游击战”，同时主张华盛顿应当供给叛乱分子大量大炮和弹药。
    “纽约每日新闻”公然站在叛乱分子那一边，极端敌视印度尼西亚人民，这没有什么奇怪。可是，当叛乱分子已临末日的时候，它还要出来大声疾呼，这倒是告诉人们一个事实：帝国主义者总是“不到黄河心不死”的，只要叛乱集团还有一兵一卒存在，他们就不会停止加以利用。只要有任何一点可能，他们就不会放弃侵略活动。“纽约每日新闻”于无意中告诉印度尼西亚人民这样一条规律，这倒是一个好消息。
