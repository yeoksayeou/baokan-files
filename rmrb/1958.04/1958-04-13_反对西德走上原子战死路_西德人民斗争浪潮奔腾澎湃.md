Comprehensive report by our newspaper: According to Xinhua News Agency on the 12th, in recent days, the broad masses of West Germany have continued to use various methods such as strikes, protest rallies, demonstrations, publishing appeals, and collecting signatures to oppose the Bonn government's policy of atomic armament.

On April 9th, the same day that 65,000 shipyard workers in Bremerhaven held a protest strike, more than 1,300 metallurgical workers in Göppingen also held a one-hour strike to protest the equipping of the West German army with atomic weapons. Prior to this, several thousand workers from three factories in Cologne had also held short protest strikes over the weekend.

The Hamburg Peace Committee organized a remarkable demonstration on April 9th. A long line of cars, fully adorned with slogans and pictures opposing atomic armament, slowly drove through the main streets, leaving a deep impression on the citizens.

On April 10th, the Frankfurt City Council of West Germany passed a motion by a vote of 48 to 15 to hold a referendum in Frankfurt on whether to agree to equip the army with nuclear warheads on German territory and build nuclear missile launch sites.

The Frankfurt City Council also passed a resolution demanding that the municipal government resolutely oppose all plans to store nuclear weapons and establish rocket launch sites within the Frankfurt urban area.

In other cities and states of West Germany, such as Schleswig-Holstein, Hesse, Bavaria, and Bremen, the Social Democratic Party and Free Democratic Party factions have also announced that they will take similar steps.

The Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party and the Presidium of the Social Democratic Party's Federal Parliamentary Group held a joint meeting on April 10th, unanimously supporting the Social Democratic Party factions in the state parliaments in proposing referendums on the state level regarding opposition to atomic armament.

At the same time, the West German government's atomic armament policy has also aroused strong unease and opposition among the public in neighboring countries.

Meetings have been held across Austria to protest the arming of the West German army with atomic weapons and the establishment of rocket bases in West Germany.

Reverend Erwin Koch of the Austrian Peace Council emphasized at a meeting in Linz: "Because the establishment of rocket bases in West Germany directly threatens Austria with atomic danger, it is now necessary to oppose this danger."

The Communist Party of Denmark is distributing leaflets calling on the Danish people to launch a struggle against the arming of the West German army with atomic weapons, against military cooperation between Denmark and West Germany, and to strive for the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing and the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in Europe.

    在不来梅港六万五千名造船工人9日举行抗议性罢工的同一天，戈宾根市一千三百余名冶金工人也举行了一小时罢工，抗议用原子武器装备西德军队。在这以前，科隆市三个工厂的几千名工人也曾经在上周末举行了短时间的抗议罢工。
    汉堡市和平委员会9日组织了一次引人注目的示威游行。一长列满挂着各种反对原子武装的标语和图片的汽车队缓缓驶过主要街道，在市民中留下了深刻的印象。
    西德法兰克福市议会10日以四十八票对十五票通过在法兰克福就是否同意在德国领土上以原子弹头的武器装备军队和建造原子弹发射基地的问题举行公民投票。
    法兰克福市议会同时还通过一项决议，要求市政府坚决反对所有要在法兰克福市区内存放原子武器和设置火箭发射基地的计划。

    丹麦共产党散发传单，号召丹麦人民展开斗争，反对用原子武器武装西德军队，反对丹麦同西德进行军事合作，争取禁止试验核武器和在欧洲建立无原子地区。
