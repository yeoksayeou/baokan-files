    Mass Mobilization, Unified Action
    Beijing Launches General Offensive Against Sparrows
    (Our Dispatch) The Capital's Sparrow Eradication Headquarters issued a general offensive order, starting today, nearly three million people will engage in a three-day arduous battle to completely eliminate sparrows.

    The operational strategy for eradicating sparrows was determined based on the sparrows' habits and weaknesses. It mainly employs a comprehensive tactic that combines frightening, poisoning, beating, and nest-raiding. During the three-day operation, manpower will be organized to drive away sparrows from 5:00 AM to 8:30 AM and from 4:00 PM to 7:30 PM each day. Searching and capturing will be carried out from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and nest-raiding will be conducted from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM.

    In recent days, the people of the capital have been engaged in intense organizational and preparatory work. Command headquarters have been established at the city, district, street, and township levels, generally led by the Party committee secretary personally directing the campaign. According to incomplete statistics, the city has been divided into approximately five hundred large and small war zones, with nearly one thousand baiting areas for poison and nearly five hundred firearm extermination areas established. The city has concentrated approximately eight thousand firearms, supplied seventy thousand firecrackers, and nearly two thousand catties of poisoned bait.

    All factories, organizations, schools, and military units in the capital, while ensuring normal production, work, and study, are actively participating in the battle. The people of the capital have great confidence in completely eliminating sparrows. In recent days, teams practicing and rehearsing have appeared everywhere. Citizens have overcome various difficulties and actively prepared, laying a dragnet for the sparrows. Sharpshooters from the People's Liberation Army, teenagers, women, and others are all determined to make contributions in the sparrow eradication campaign.

    全民动员　统一行动
    北京市开始总攻麻雀
    本报讯　首都围剿麻雀总指挥部发布总攻令，从今天起，近三百万人苦战三天，全面围剿麻雀。
    围剿麻雀的作战方针，是根据麻雀的习性和弱点决定的。主要是采用轰、毒、打、掏兼施并用的综合战术，在三天的作战中，每天早五时至八时半、下午四时至七时半，组织人力轰赶，上午八时至下午四时进行搜捕，晚八时至十时进行掏窝。
    连日来，首都人民进行了紧张的组织、准备工作。成立了市、区、街、乡各级指挥部，一般都是以党委书记挂帅亲自指挥战役。据不完全统计，全市划分了大小五百个战区，设置了近一千处施放毒饵的诱捕区和近五百处火枪歼灭区。全市集中了约八千支火枪，供应七十万颗爆竹和近两千斤毒饵。
    首都各工厂、机关、学校、部队，除保证正常的生产、工作、学习以外，都积极参加战斗。首都人民对全歼麻雀的信心很大，近几天来，到处出现练兵、演习的队伍。市民们克服了种种困难，积极进行准备，给麻雀布下了天罗地网。解放军的神枪手、青少年、妇女等，都决心要在围剿麻雀的战役里立下功劳。
