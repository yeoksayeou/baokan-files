      Good Essays
      After reading Comrade Yang Xianzhen's three big-character posters published in the People's Daily on April 3rd and 5th (“One's Personal History is Written by One's Words and Deeds,” “Liberating Oneself from the ‘Chains of Fame and Fetters of Gain’,” and “Being Strong in Old Age Versus Premature Aging”), me and several comrades here unanimously agreed that they are three good essays.

    In terms of writing style, these three articles are concise, lively, and diverse. Some are written using a combination of narration and commentary, some use metaphors and citations, and some use contrast. The language is also very vivid. But more importantly, each article addresses a problem, is written pertinently and practically, and is substantive.

    I hope that some of our leading comrades who do ideological and political work will write more such realistic and targeted essays. At the same time, I hope that our editors will regularly select excellent big-character posters for publication in newspapers, promote the reform of writing style, and make a great leap forward in essay writing.

      好杂文
      读了4月3日和5日人民日报发表的杨献珍同志的三篇大字报（“个人历史是由自己的言行写成的”，“从‘名缰利索’中解放出来”，“老当益壮与未老先衰”），我和我们这儿好几个同志一致认为是三篇好杂文。
    这三篇文章在写作形式上短小精悍、活泼多样，有的是用夹叙夹议的方法写的，有的是用比喻和引证的方法写的，有的是用对比的方法写的。在语言方面也很生动。但更主要的是一篇文章解决了一个问题，写得中肯实际，言之有物。
    希望我们一些做思想工作和政治工作的领导同志，写出更多这样实事求是、有的放矢的杂文来。同时也希望我们的编辑同志经常选择一些优秀的大字报在报纸上发表，促进文风的改革，使杂文来个大跃进。　河南商丘读者　刘敏吾
