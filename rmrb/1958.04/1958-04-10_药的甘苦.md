    The Sweetness and Bitterness of Medicine
    Fu Luo
    As the saying goes, "Good medicine tastes bitter but is good for disease." In fact, not all good medicines are necessarily bitter. For example, licorice, which is used to relieve coughs, is sweet; mint, which is used for cooling and dispelling wind, is spicy; hawthorn, which is used to stimulate the appetite and aid digestion, is sour; prunella vulgaris, which is used as a diuretic, is salty; and schisandra, which is used to stimulate the nerves, has five flavors: sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, and salty. Moreover, many bitter medicines have been "transformed" by pharmacists to become tasteless, such as chloramphenicol.
    Generally, people probably think that honey is the sweetest thing. Honey contains a large amount of glucose and fructose, especially glucose, which can be absorbed and utilized by the human body without being digested by the human stomach. Therefore, honey has long been one of the best nutritional supplements. However, there are many sweeter medicines! The licorice mentioned above, this inexpensive and widely used plant medicine that is happily used by both Chinese and Western medicine, has an extremely strong sweet taste. One part of licorice in 20,000 parts of water can still show the sweetness of licorice. As for saccharin, which everyone is familiar with, it is a medicine made by chemical methods. One gram of saccharin has the sweetness equivalent to half a kilogram (one kilogram is one thousand grams) of white sugar. But all of these are not as good as perillartine. This medicine is a compound extracted from the Chinese medicine perilla (used for sweating and cough suppression) and chemically treated, and its sweetness is eight to ten times that of saccharin. It can truly be called the "King of Sweetness."
    Some bitter medicines have their efficacy precisely in their "bitterness." For example, there is a class of drugs called alkaloids, which are alkaline substances extracted from the roots, stems, leaves, bark, fruits, or seeds of plants. In the entire world of medicine, they are famous for their strong bitterness on one hand, and known for their outstanding therapeutic effects on the other. Coptis chinensis is one of them. The yellow alkaloid "berberine" it contains is extremely bitter, but it "greatly cures dysentery" (these are the words of Su Gong, a famous Chinese pharmacist in the Tang Dynasty, who first discovered the medicinal effect of Coptis chinensis). Another amazingly bitter medicine is quinine, an alkaloid extracted from the bark of the cinchona tree. Its bitterness can kill malaria parasites and occupies a high position in antimalarial drugs. As for the bitterest thing, it is probably "bile," hence the saying "sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall." Ox bile juice extracted from the gallbladder of cattle is indeed bitter, but it is the most ideal fat digestion medicine. In plants, there is a Chinese medicine called gentian, which is named for its bitter taste like bile. A gentian root less than an inch long can turn a large pot of water into bitter water.

    药的甘苦
    弗罗
    俗语说“良药苦口利于病”，其实，并不是凡良药就必苦的。例如用作祛痰的甘草是甜的；用作清凉、驱风的薄荷是辣的；用作开胃助消化的山楂是酸的；用作利尿的夏枯草是咸的；用作神经兴奋的五味子，则具备甜、酸、苦、辣、咸五种滋味。而且，许多苦药经过药学家的“改造”变成无味的了，如氯霉素即是。
    最甜的东西，一般大概以为止于蜂蜜了吧。蜂蜜含有大量的葡萄糖和果糖，特别是葡萄糖，可以不经过人的肠胃的消化就能被人体吸收利用。所以长期以来，蜂蜜一直是最好的营养补品之一。但是，还有许多更甜的药品呢！上面提到的甘草，这个价廉而用途极广，且为中西医药界乐于采用的植物药，甜味极强。把一分甘草放在两万分水中，仍然能够显出甘草的甜味来。至于大家熟知的糖精，则是一种用化学方法制成的药品。一克糖精的甜味，相当于半公斤（一公斤有一千克）的白糖。但所有这些，都比不上紫苏醛肟。这药是从中药紫苏（用作发汗、镇咳的药）中提炼出来经过化学处理的一种化合物，甜味八倍到十倍于糖精，真可称是“甜王”了。
    有一些苦药，功效正在于“苦”上。例如有一类叫作植物碱的药物，是从植物的根、茎、叶、树皮、果实或种子中提出的一种碱性物质。它们在整个药的世界里，一面以强烈的苦味出名，一面却以卓绝的疗效著称。黄连即是其中一种。它所含的一种黄色的植物碱“黄连素”，味极苦，却“疗痢大善”（这是我国唐朝著名药学家苏恭的话，他最早发现黄连的药效）。还有一种令人咋舌的苦药是奎宁，是从金鸡纳树的树皮中提出来的一种植物碱。它的苦味能杀死疟原虫，在抗疟药中占很高地位。至于最苦的东西，大概莫过于“胆”了吧，所以有“卧薪尝胆”的说法。从牛的胆囊中提出的牛胆汁，味确实苦，却是一种最合理想的脂肪消化药。在植物中有一种叫龙胆草的中药，就是因为味苦如胆而得的名。一根不足一寸长的龙胆草，能够使一大壶水变成苦水。
