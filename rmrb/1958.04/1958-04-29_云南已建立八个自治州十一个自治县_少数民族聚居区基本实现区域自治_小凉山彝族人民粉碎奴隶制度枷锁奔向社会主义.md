Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 28th: Yunnan Province has basically achieved ethnic regional autonomy in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities. Currently, the province has established eight autonomous prefectures and eleven autonomous counties. The minority nationalities in these areas number more than 3.8 million, accounting for 68% of the province's total minority population.

Yunnan has a minority population of more than 5.6 million people, belonging to twenty major ethnic groups and sixty ethnic subgroups. Some ethnic groups have relatively concentrated areas of habitation, while others are scattered throughout the province's counties and cities. Yunnan Province began to promote ethnic regional autonomy in a planned way from 1953. Before establishing autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties in the border regions, all localities strengthened ethnic unity through various ethnic works, cultivated a group of enlightened ethnic cadres, and then fully consulted with ethnic public leaders and the masses to establish autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties. Now, with the exception of the Kawa ethnic group, which is preparing to establish an ethnic autonomous area, the Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Hani, Lahu, Zhuang, and other ethnic groups living along the four-thousand-mile border have all established autonomous prefectures or autonomous counties. The Drung ethnic group with a population of only over 2,500 and the Nu ethnic group with a population of over 12,000 have also jointly established the Gongshan Drung-Nu Autonomous County. In the minority areas in inland Yunnan, the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture was established in April this year. Minority nationalities scattered in the vast rural areas have also established ethnic townships since 1956. Some ethnic groups living in small areas within autonomous prefectures and inland areas, such as the Yao and Miao ethnic groups in Hekou and Pingbian counties within the Honghe Hani-Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the Yi ethnic group in Yangbi County within the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, and the Naxi ethnic group in Lijiang County, are also preparing or considering the establishment of ethnic autonomous areas.

Under the leadership of the Party and higher-level people's governments, all ethnic regional autonomous areas have achieved great achievements in agriculture, industry, culture, education, health, and other undertakings. Grassroots Party organizations have been established in all ethnic autonomous areas. The various ethnic groups in the interior achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization in 1956. In the border regions of Yunnan, such as the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and the Honghe Hani-Yi Autonomous Prefecture, where peaceful consultation land reform was carried out, 40% of peasant households have joined agricultural cooperatives. In ethnic areas such as the Lisu and Jingpo, where class differentiation is not obvious and will directly transition to socialism without undergoing a reform movement, more than 140,000 peasant households have now joined cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 28th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Changlu reports: The Yi people of Xiaoliangshan in Yunnan Province are leaping towards socialism at a rapid pace after breaking the shackles of the slave system.

In just a few months, under the leadership of the Party and the autonomous organs, the Yi people of Xiaoliangshan organized a large number of mutual aid teams and established one hundred and two agricultural cooperatives and forty-one farms. This type of farm is a special organization that helps the Yi people, who have been liberated from the slave system but still lack the means of production, transition to socialism. The government provides farm tools, plowing cattle, and funds, and the farmers invest the land they have been allocated as shares, and remuneration is based on labor. Currently, in the Xiaoliangshan area's Ninglang Yi Autonomous County, the number of peasant households participating in farms and agricultural cooperatives accounts for 26% of the total number of peasant households.

In order to make rice grow in Xiaoliangshan, which is two thousand five hundred meters above sea level, tens of thousands of Yi people braved the severe cold last winter to dig ditches and canals on steep cliffs, working from dawn till late at night, and did not even take a break from construction during the New Year. By this spring, one thousand water conservancy projects were completed, which can irrigate one hundred thousand mu of farmland. More than nine thousand mu of paddy fields have now been opened up, and the first batch of rice seeds in the history of Xiaoliangshan has been sown. The Yi people did not have the habit of accumulating fertilizer in the past, but this year every household has built toilets to accumulate fertilizer. The county has accumulated 200 million jin of fertilizer, averaging more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer per household.

    云南已建立八个自治州十一个自治县
    少数民族聚居区基本实现区域自治
    小凉山彝族人民粉碎奴隶制度枷锁奔向社会主义
    新华社昆明28日电　云南省少数民族聚居地区已基本上实现民族区域自治。现在，全省已建立了八个自治州和十一个自治县。这些地区的少数民族有三百八十多万人，占全省少数民族总人口的68％。
    云南境内少数民族共有五百六十多万人，分属于二十个主要民族和六十个民族支系。一部分民族有着比较集中的聚居区，其他杂居于全省各个县市。从1953年开始，云南省便有计划地开始推行民族区域自治。在边疆成立自治州和自治县以前，各地都通过各项民族工作，加强了民族团结，并培养了一批有觉悟的民族干部，然后与民族公众领袖人物和群众进行充分协商，建立自治州和自治县。现在，边疆地区除了佧佤族正在筹备建立民族自治地方以外，聚居在四千里国境线上的傣族、景颇族、傈僳族、哈尼族、拉祜族、僮族等，已经全部建立了自治州或自治县。人口只有二千五百多人的独龙族和一万二千多人的怒族，也联合成立了贡山独龙族怒族自治县。在云南省内地少数民族地区，今年4月建立了楚雄彝族自治州，散居在广大农村的少数民族，也从1956年起分别成立了民族乡。小片地聚居在自治州和内地的一些民族，如红河哈尼族彝族自治州内河口、屏边两县的瑶族和苗族，大理白族自治州内漾濞县的彝族，丽江县的纳西族等，也正在筹备或酝酿建立民族自治地方的工作。
    在党和上级人民政府的领导下，各个民族区域自治地方在农业、工业、文教卫生等各项事业上，都获得了巨大成就。各民族自治地方普遍建立了党的基层组织。内地各民族在1956年就实现了农业高级合作化。西双版纳傣族自治州、德宏傣族景颇族自治州、红河哈尼族彝族自治州等云南边疆进行和平协商土地改革的地区，已有占总农户40％的农户参加农业社。在阶级分化尚不明显、将不经过改革运动而直接过渡到社会主义的傈僳族、景颇族等民族地区，现在已有十四万多农户入社。
    据新华社昆明28日电　新华社记者黄昌禄报道：云南省小凉山彝族人民在粉碎了奴隶制度的枷锁后，以飞快速度向社会主义跃进。
    在短短几个月内，小凉山彝族人民在党和自治机关的领导下，组织了大量的互助组，建立起一百零二个农业社和四十一个农场。这种农场是国家帮助从奴隶制度下解放出来后仍缺乏生产资料的彝人过渡到社会主义的特殊组织，由政府供给农具、耕牛和资金，农民将分得的土地入股，实行按劳取酬。现在，小凉山区宁蒗彝族自治县参加农场和农业社的农户，已经占农户总数的26％。
    为了叫拔海二千五百公尺的小凉山长出大米，去年冬天几万彝人冒着严寒在悬岩陡坡上开沟挖渠，从黎明干到深夜，新年也不下工地，到今春完成水利工程一千处，可灌溉田地十万亩，现在已经开出水田九千多亩，撒下了小凉山上有史以来的第一批稻种。彝人过去没有积肥习惯，今年家家修厕所积肥，全县已积肥两亿斤，平均每户积肥两万多斤。
