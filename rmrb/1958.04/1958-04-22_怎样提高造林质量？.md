How to Improve Afforestation Quality?
Cheng Chongde, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Afforestation Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry

Since last winter and this spring, a magnificent and large-scale greening campaign has been launched across the country. Southern provinces have been advancing at a rate of two to three million mu of afforestation per day. Now the movement is surging northward, constantly creating new climaxes. The general situation is: high enthusiasm, early action, rapid progress, sustained duration, large afforestation area, and a large number of trees planted. At the same time, the quality of afforestation has also improved significantly compared with the past.

In order to ensure the quality of afforestation, all regions have adopted various active measures according to local conditions: training a large number of forestry workers to impart technology, and some townships have also established technical exchange networks; most regions have carried out land preparation before afforestation; generally, attention has been paid to the quality of seedlings, and many regions have also carried out fertilization and watering, and timely inspection systems have been established. According to preliminary inspection results, the afforestation quality in most areas is basically satisfactory. For example, in Zunyi and Bijie in Guizhou Province, and Xiangtan and Hengyang in Hunan Province, inspections of afforestation quality showed that 85% met technical requirements. Yuexi County, Anhui Province, completed 1.25 million mu of afforestation, with an average of only one plant per mu not meeting the requirements.

However, a few areas have experienced situations of rushing tasks, seizing time, emphasizing quantity, and neglecting quality during the greening upsurge. Due to insufficient ideological mobilization, inadequate preparatory work, and insufficient implementation of technology, phenomena such as planting density being too sparse or too dense, holes being too small or too shallow, seeding amount being too much or too little, soil covering being too thick or too thin, seedlings not being well cared for and becoming dry and withered, or planting being too shallow, causing root coiling or root exposure, have occurred.

	Trees Must Be Planted to Live
Based on the current afforestation situation and the lessons learned from the past few years, to improve the quality of afforestation, we must strive towards the following two goals:

1.  Afforestation must first ensure that trees survive, and then grow into trees and forests; otherwise, it is a great waste of labor, seedlings, and land. Therefore, we must pay attention to the following links when afforesting:

Select mature and full seeds. Old seeds, shriveled grains, moldy and rotten seeds, and seeds that have been affected by diseases and insect pests cannot be used for sowing afforestation or seedling cultivation. Select strong seedlings. Using healthy, strong seedlings with developed root systems for afforestation ensures successful survival. When cultivating seedlings, the appropriate seeding amount, sowing period, seedling yield should be mastered, and management should be strengthened; during seedling lifting, transportation, and planting, protective measures should be taken to avoid wind and sun exposure, so as to avoid damage to the seedlings. Prepare the land carefully. Before afforestation, the land should be plowed, the soil loosened, and water stored to create good soil conditions for the growth of young trees. In northern mountainous areas, it is best to dig fish-scale pits or open horizontal ditches; in arid grassland areas, it is best to prepare the land during the rainy season one year in advance and adopt a fallow system, which has a significant effect on improving the survival rate. Master planting techniques. The planting hole must be larger than the seedling root, so that the seedling roots can be stretched. Seedling roots that are curled or planted too shallow are not easy to survive, and even if they do survive, they will not grow well. The backfilling soil must be compacted to ensure close contact between the seedling roots and the soil, which can also avoid air leakage and water loss in the hole. In terms of sowing, the most important thing is to master the thickness of the covering soil, which is generally two to three times the diameter of the seed. After afforestation, prevent damage from humans and animals, and birds and animals from stealing seeds and gnawing on seedlings. Weeding and loosening of the soil must be carried out in a timely manner. When there is drought and lack of rain, watering is also necessary.

Increase Timber Production
2.  The requirements for afforestation quality should not be limited to survival rate, but should further require more timber production and more protective effects. To achieve this goal, we must pay attention to the following points.

Select excellent tree species. Afforestation must first consider what tree species to choose. When selecting tree species, we must pay attention to the principle of considering both economic requirements and biological characteristics, that is, to choose excellent tree species that are widely used, have high yields, and generate more income. First of all, we should select well-growing tree species from local tree species in this area. If necessary, we can introduce foreign tree species that are suitable for the local natural environment. We should also study and determine according to the local conditions of the afforestation land: what trees to plant on the mountain, what trees to plant at the foot of the mountain, what trees to plant on the sunny slope, and what trees to plant on the shady slope. When choosing tree species, we cannot be too simple, because the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's living standards also require various types of timber and forest products, but we cannot blindly plant whatever we have, or plant whatever can grow.

To increase timber production, the appropriate density must be controlled during afforestation. If planted too densely, the trees will be too crowded and will not be able to meet the needs of the trees for water, nutrients, and sunlight; if planted too sparsely, the tree shape will not grow well, and land will be wasted. When cultivating timber forests, hoping that the trees will grow tall, with straight trunks and few knots, they should not be planted sparsely. Planting special economic forests or fruit trees generally hopes to produce more fruits, so of course, they cannot be planted densely. In order to produce mine props, cross arms and other small-diameter wood or to create fuel forests, it is necessary to plant as densely as possible. From the perspective of natural conditions and the characteristics of tree species, tree species with warm climates, fertile and moist soil, and fast growth should be sparser; on the contrary, they should be planted more densely. However, places with overly harsh conditions and poor water and nutrient content cannot be too dense. Generally, 400 to 800 trees should be planted per mu for timber forests and protection forests.

Actively tend the trees. The author visited Xihou Township, Nanping County, Fujian Province last year, which has the highest unit area yield of Chinese fir forests in the country (the wood accumulation per mu reaches 50 to 60 cubic meters, which is three to five times that of ordinary Chinese fir forests), and learned that their experience in high yield of fir forests is mainly two points: one is reasonable dense planting, with two to three times more plants planted per mu than in other places; the other is intensive cultivation, generally weeding and loosening the soil nine to twelve times within three years after afforestation, which is one to three times more than other fir forests. Therefore, it cannot be considered that planting trees or sowing seeds is the completion of the afforestation task, but tending work should be carried out carefully and continuously throughout the growth period of the young forest to promote the healthy growth of trees.

	Plant More Mixed Forests
Advocate for the creation of mixed forests. Afforestation in our country has always been accustomed to creating pure forests of a single tree species, which should be said to be a shortcoming. In the future, the creation of mixed forests should be developed as a direction. Because there are many benefits to mixed afforestation, such as the different distribution ranges of the roots of different tree species in the soil, which can fully absorb nutrients and water from the soil layer. Due to the different layers and light preferences of the tree crowns, the trees can make full use of sunlight; at the same time, due to the different composition of the forest, the resistance to diseases and insect pests, wind, snow, drought, and fire, as well as the role of water conservation, are much stronger than forests of a single tree species. In short, adopting the method of mixed forest is beneficial to promoting tree growth and improving soil, and it is worth advocating. Especially for afforestation in relatively arid areas, or for creating soil and water conservation forests and farmland protection forests, it is best to use a mixture of trees and shrubs. In order to prevent fire and insect disasters, it is best to use a mixture of coniferous and broad-leaved tree species.

Strengthen Organizational Leadership
The key to improving the quality of afforestation is to strengthen organizational leadership. I think the current tasks that need to be grasped are:

First, deeply publicize forestry policies and the importance of improving the quality of afforestation to raise the awareness of cadres and the masses. Organizing visits and holding "battlefield meetings" and using advanced examples as role models is very effective. For example, many mountainous areas in the north use "Daquan Mountain" as a standard for afforestation. Hunan Province has launched the "Shuxikou" (Chinese fir forests are well-made) and "Honglongshan" (afforestation of barren hills in hilly areas is well-made) campaigns, so that everyone can compare the quality of afforestation.

Second, cooperatives should establish specialized forestry (or combined with water conservancy and sideline industries) production organizations, such as cooperative forest farms, forestry production teams, etc. With dedicated personnel engaged in forestry, not only can forestry production be carried out all year round, but it is also easy to impart and improve technology, the quality of afforestation is easy to improve, and the results of afforestation are easy to consolidate.

Third, do a good job in seed collection and seedling cultivation to provide a reliable material basis for afforestation. The afforestation tasks in the next few years will inevitably expand a lot, so it is not only necessary to collect enough seeds and cultivate enough seedlings, but also to have good quality seedlings to ensure the quality of afforestation.

Fourth, organize large-scale inspections and evaluations. In the mass afforestation movement of thousands of troops and horses, we must seize the inspection of afforestation and survival and maintenance, and consolidate the achievements of the greening movement.

    怎样提高造林质量？
    林业部造林局副总工程师　程崇德
    去冬今春以来，在全国范围内开展了规模壮阔、声势浩大的绿化运动，南方各省曾以每天造林两、三百万亩的进度向前发展，现在运动正由南向北不断涌现新的高潮。总的情况是：干劲足、动手早、进展快、持续久、造林面积大、植树数量多，同时造林质量也较以往有了显著的提高。
    为了保证造林质量，各地区都因地制宜地采取了各种积极措施：大批训练林业员，传授技术，有的乡还建立技术交流网；造林前大部分地区都进行了整地；一般都重视了种苗质量，不少地区还进行了施肥、浇水，并且及时建立了检查制度。从初步检查的结果来看，大部分地区的造林质量基本上是令人满意的。如贵州省遵义、毕节和湖南省湘潭、衡阳等专区检查造林质量，有85％都合于技术要求。安徽省岳西县完成造林一百二十五万亩，平均每亩只有一株不合要求。
    但是，也有少数地区在绿化高潮中，出现了赶任务、抢时间、重数量、轻质量的情况。由于思想发动不透、准备工作不足、技术贯彻不够，因而发生栽植密度过稀或过密，开穴过小或过浅，播种量过多或过少，复土过厚或过薄，苗木未很好护理已变干枯，或栽植太浅窝根或露根等现象。
      栽树要栽活
    根据当前造林情况和过去几年的经验教训来看，要提高造林质量，必须向以下两个目标努力：
    一、造林首先要求树能成活，然后要求长大成树成林；否则就是劳力、种苗、土地等方面的很大浪费。因此，造林时一定要注意下面几个环节：
    精选成熟饱满的种子。陈种、瘪粒、霉烂和受过病虫害的种子，都不能用来播种造林或育苗。选用健壮的苗木。用健康、粗壮、根系发达的苗木造林，成活就有把握。在育苗时，应该掌握适当的播种量、播种期、产苗量和加强扶育管理工作；在起苗、运苗和栽植的时候，要采取保护措施，避免风吹日晒，以免苗木受损伤。认真整地。在造林前先翻耕土地、疏松土壤、储水蓄墒，为幼树生长创造良好的土壤条件。北方山地最好挖鱼鳞坑或开水平沟；干旱草原地区最好在一年前的雨季到来时进行整地，并采用休间制，这对提高成活率有显著的作用。掌握种植技术。栽树的穴，一定要开得比苗根大，使苗根舒展，苗根卷曲或栽浅了都不容易活，活了也长不好。填土必须踩实，使苗根与土壤密切结合，也可避免穴里透风、消失水分。在播种方面，最重要的是掌握复土的厚度，一般复土的厚度是种子直径的二——三倍。造林后，要防止人畜损坏和鸟兽偷吃种子、啃坏苗木。要及时进行除草松土。干旱缺雨的时候，还要浇水。
    提高林木产量
    二、对于造林质量的要求，不能仅限于成活率，还应该进一步要求多产木材，多发挥防护作用。要达到这个目的，就一定要重视以下几点。
    选择优良树种。造林，首先要考虑选择什么树种。在选择树种时，要注意经济要求与生物特性兼顾的原则，就是要选择用途广，产量高，收益多的优良树种。首先应当在本地区乡土树种中挑选生长良好的树种，必要时可引进适合当地自然环境的外来树种。还应当根据造林地局部情况研究确定：山上栽什么树，山脚栽什么树，阳坡栽什么树，阴坡栽什么树。在选择树种的时候不能过于单纯，因为工农业生产的发展和人民生活的提高，对木材和各种林产品的需要，也是各式各样的，但是也不能盲目地有什么就造什么，或能长什么就栽什么。
    要提高木材产量，造林时要掌握适当密度。植得太密，林木过于拥挤，就不能满足林木对于水分、养分、日光的需要；植得太稀，树形就长不好，而且浪费了土地。营造用材林，希望林木长得高、树干直、节疤少，就不应稀植。种植特用经济林或果树，一般是希望多产果实，当然就不能密植。为了生产矿柱、交手杆等小径级木或者营造薪炭林，就要尽可能地密植。从自然条件和树种的特性来看，气候温暖、土壤肥沃、湿润和生长快的树种，应当稀些；相反，就应当种植得密些。但是条件过于恶劣，水分养分太差的地方也不能太密。一般用材林和防护林每亩应栽四百棵到八百棵。
    积极抚育林木。作者去年曾访问了全国杉木林单位面积产量最高的（每亩木材蓄积量达五十到六十立公尺，为一般杉木林的三到五倍）福建省南平县溪后乡，了解到他们杉林丰产的经验，主要是两条：一是合理密植，每亩栽植株数比别处多二到三倍；另一条就是精耕细作，一般在造林后三年内除草松土九到十二次，比其他杉林要多一到三倍。因此，不能认为栽了树或播了种就算完成造林任务，而应当在整个幼林生长期间，认真地持续地进行抚育工作，促进林木生长健旺。
      多造混交林
    提倡营造混交林。我国造林一向都习惯造单一树种的纯林，这应该说是一个缺点。今后应当把营造混交林做为一个方向来发展。因为混交造林的好处很多，如不同树种的根在土壤中的分布范围不同，就可以充分吸收土层里的养分和水分。由于树冠的多层和喜光性的不同，树木可以充分利用日光；同时由于林木的组成不同，对于病虫害、风、雪、干旱、火灾的抵抗力，以及对于水源涵养的作用，都比单纯树种的森林要强得多。总之，采取混交林的方法，对于促进林木生长和改良土壤都有好处，值得提倡。尤其比较干旱的地区的造林，或营造水土保持林、农田防护林等，最好是采用乔灌木混交。为防止火灾、虫灾最好采用针阔叶树种混交。
    加强组织领导工作
    提高造林质量的重要关键是加强组织领导。我认为当前需要抓紧的工作是：
    第一、深入宣传林业政策和提高造林质量的重要性，提高干部和群众的认识。组织参观，开“战地会议”，以先进事例做榜样，这种做法很有效。如北方很多山区造林以“大泉山”做为标准。湖南省则开展了“疏溪口”（杉木林造得好）和“洪龙山”（丘陵区荒山造林造得好）运动，这样大家都可以来比一比造林质量了。
    第二、合作社要建立林业（或与水利、副业结合）专业生产组织，如合作林场、林业生产队等。有了专人搞林业，不仅可以常年进行林业生产，而且容易传授和提高技术，造林的质量就容易提高，造林的成果就容易巩固。
    第三、搞好采种育苗工作，为造林提供可靠的物质基础。今后几年的造林任务势必还要扩大很多，因此不仅要采集足够的种子，培育足够的苗木，而且要种苗的质量好，才能保证造林的质量。
    第四、组织大规模的检查评比，在千军万马的群众造林运动中，必须抓紧检查造林情况和成活养护情况，巩固绿化运动的成果。
