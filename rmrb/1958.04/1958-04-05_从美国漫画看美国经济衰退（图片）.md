Seeing the American Economic Recession Through American Cartoons

	Out of Reach
	Under the cruel exploitation of monopoly capital, the lives of American working people and the general public are difficult. Prices are constantly rising, and consumers' purchasing power is declining.
			(Originally published in "New York Post")

	Flooded Disaster
	According to the official American view, if the number of unemployed in a region exceeds 6% of the total number of employed workers, then the region is considered a disaster area. Currently, the number of unemployed in the United States exceeds five million, accounting for 7.7% of the total number of employed workers. American economist Rothenberg said: "We must admit that the entire United States is now a disaster area." (Originally published in the American "Newsweek")

	Ineffective Medicine
	The American economy is in a full-scale recession, and bourgeois economists are sweating profusely, at a loss.
			(Originally published in "New York Herald Tribune")

	Myth Broken
	The American ruling group often boasts and touts America's "prosperity." Now, due to the recurrence of the economic recession, this myth has been shattered.
		(Originally published in the American "Baltimore Sun")

	--"Madam, this can be fixed, but we can't say when it will be fixed."
	Economist: "I, as a doctor, have no cure for this disease either."

    从美国漫画看美国经济衰退
    望尘莫及
    在垄断资本的残酷剥削下，美国劳动人民和广大公众生活困难。物价不断上涨，消费者的购买力日益下降。
                  （原载“纽约邮报”）
     泛滥成灾
    按照美国官方的说法，如果一个地区的失业人数超过在业工人总数的6％，那么这个地区便算灾区。目前美国失业人数超过五百万人，占在业工人总数7.7％。美国经济学家罗廷贝尔格说：“我们必须承认现在整个美国是个灾区”。（原载美国“新闻周刊”）
    医药无效
    美国经济全面衰退，资产阶级经济学家急得满头大汗，束手无策。
              （原载“纽约先驱论坛报”）
    神话破产
    美国统治集团经常大吹法螺，标榜美国的“繁荣”。现在，由于经济衰退的旧病复发，这种神话破产了。
        （原载美国“巴尔的摩太阳报”）
    ——“夫人，这是能修好的，但是我们不能说什么时候修好。”
    经济学家：“我这个大夫对这种病也毫无办法。”
