    惊破英国殖民者好梦
    塞浦路斯爆炸声四起
    新华社20日讯　尼科西亚消息：塞浦路斯爱国者正在加紧采取行动来反抗英国的殖民统治。
    昨天，离英国驻塞浦路斯总督府约一百码的一个电力变压器被塞浦路斯爱国者炸毁了。爆炸的巨响把英国总督福特从梦中惊醒。甚至在离爆炸地点一英里以外，都听到爆炸声。这是这一天塞浦路斯岛上的第二十件爆炸事件。
    同一天，在埃毕斯科比地方英军兵营的抽水给水设备全部被炸毁。这个兵营在十二个钟头内就发生了五次爆炸事件，房屋也被炸毁了。在尼科西亚近郊的一个兵营一天之内两次起火。此外，还有一所尚未完工的警察局和一间军用厨房被炸毁，伤英军二人。许多电线杆也被塞浦路斯爱国者烧毁。
