Xinhua News Agency dispatches: Damascus newspapers reported on April 2nd that officials there received news early on April 2nd that Iraq had urgently dispatched a large number of troops to the Syrian-Iraqi border area on April 1st, concentrating them in a certain location opposite the Syrian border city of Buqamal.

Prior to this, a Syrian regional military spokesman announced that Israeli troops had attacked Arab residents in the demilitarized zone between Syria and Israel twice on March 30th, and invaded the villages of Jalabina and Derdara near Lake Tiberias. Simultaneously, Israel is concentrating troops in some areas along the Syrian-Israeli border.

The Director of the Arab United Republic News Bureau in Cairo stated to reporters from the Middle East News Agency on the evening of March 30th that the Arab United Republic had sent a memorandum to the United Nations Secretary-General on the evening of March 29th, accusing Israel of repeated armed aggression against the demilitarized zone east of Hula from March 24th to 27th, and of carrying out unusual troop movements. The statement said: "These successive and pre-planned events clearly demonstrate Israel's aggressive intentions, which, if unchecked, will threaten peace in the region."

The Damascus newspaper "Al-Ra'i al-'Aam" said in an editorial on April 2nd entitled "New Conspiracy" that the recent events on the Iraqi-Syrian border and the Israeli-Syrian border are well-organized imperialist plans.

    帝国主义侵叙野心未死
    以色列和伊拉克在叙边境蠢动
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：大马士革许多报纸2日报道，据这里的官员们2日一早收到消息，伊拉克在1日火急调派大批军队到叙利亚—伊拉克边境一带，集中在叙利亚的边境城市布加马尔对面的某地。
    在这以前，叙利亚地区军方发言人宣布，以色列军队在3月30日一天之内，两度袭击了叙利亚地区和以色列之间的非军事区的阿拉伯居民，并且侵入泰里亚斯湖附近贾拉比纳和德尔达拉两个村庄。同时，以色列正在沿叙以边境的一些地区集结军队。
    阿拉伯联合共和国新闻局局长30日晚间在开罗对中东通讯社记者发表声明说，阿拉伯联合共和国已经在29日晚间向联合国秘书长发出一份备忘录，控诉以色列在3月24日到27日这几天中对胡拉以东的非军事区一再进行武装侵略，同时还进行了不寻常的调动。声明说：“这些接连不断的预先策划好的事件清楚证明了以色列的侵略意图，这种侵略意图如果不加以制止，就会威胁这个地区的和平。”
    大马士革“舆论报”2日在以“新阴谋”为题的社论中说，最近在伊（拉克）—叙边境以及以（色列）—叙边境所发生的事情是组织得很好的帝国主义的计划。
