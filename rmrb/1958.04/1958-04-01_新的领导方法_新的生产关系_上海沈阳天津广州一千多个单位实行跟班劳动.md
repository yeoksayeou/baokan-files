Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th: Shanghai State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 2 boldly innovated enterprise management organization and political work methods during the rectification movement. The factory's management organization was changed from the original three-level system of factory, workshop, and work team to a two-level system of factory and workshop. The Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations were all formed according to the three shifts, to adapt to the three-shift production characteristics of cotton textile factories. All branch secretaries returned to production posts, and management cadres worked and participated in labor on the job.

On March 17th, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting at the State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 2 to introduce the factory's experience. In the two weeks since, more than a hundred factories have studied the experience of the State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 2, and, combining it with the production characteristics of their own factories, reformed production management organizations and implemented on-the-job work and labor for cadres. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held its second on-site meeting at the State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 2, specifically to exchange experiences in promotion by various factories.

According to the introductions of several factories, there are now approximately two situations for factories implementing on-the-job work for cadres. One is large-scale factories similar to the State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 2. After the reform, the number of management organization levels was reduced, and the institutions were streamlined. The number of management personnel decreased from the original figure of more than ten percent of the total number of employees to 6% or 7%. State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 7, which only produces yarn and thread, further implemented a system of direct shift leadership by the chief engineer and factory director. They were each fixed to work with one production shift, directly leading workers in production. Some cadres in the planning and labor sections of the offices, as well as material clerks in the supply section, went deep into the production shifts to do planning, labor work, and grasp material consumption quotas. Only a small number of cadres were left in the factory offices to do comprehensive balance work for planning. In this way, the office work was completely combined with production, and the proportion of management cadres in the total number of employees in the factory also decreased from 12.1% before the rectification movement to 4.5%.

The other situation is small factories with only around a hundred employees, represented by the jointly-owned Guanghua Electroplating Factory. This factory itself only had forty-five employees, plus two satellite factories, totaling eighty-nine people. After the reform, the state-appointed factory director and the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary and deputy secretary all participated in production on the job, only taking one day a week to handle administrative and Party affairs. Three of the six staff members were left to manage daily administration and also regularly participated in labor, while the remaining three were assigned to the workshop as workers.

The large number of facts that have emerged in the recent short period eloquently demonstrates that such bold reforms make management organizations truly face production, fundamentally changing the past situation where no one was responsible for sixteen hours of the twenty-four-hour production cycle. The worker masses welcome this, and the cadres have also found a path to being both red and expert. The workers praised such reforms as fruitful results brought about by the rectification and "double-anti" movement.

Chen Pixian and Ma Tianshui, secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, pointed out at the meeting yesterday that all factories in the city with three-shift and two-shift production systems should learn from the experience of cadres working on the job at the State-Owned Cotton Factory No. 2. Although the specific conditions of each factory are different, and the method of on-the-job work can be different, all factories should not be an exception to participating in labor on the job.

This newspaper reports: According to a Shenyang Daily report, as of March 24th, according to incomplete statistics, 807 units in Shenyang City have started 1,430 "experimental fields"; 2,889 leading comrades have gone deep into workshops to work and participate in labor on the job; and 674 leading cadres have moved into workers' residential areas to settle down. This action has been universally welcomed by the employees.

This newspaper, Tianjin, March 31st: More than 1,800 leading cadres from more than 600 factories in Tianjin City have learned from the experience of the Tianjin Second Printing and Dyeing Factory and implemented "on-the-job labor." Because factories vary in size, technical level, equipment conditions, and product complexity, specific practices also vary. Some factory leaders work several hours a day on the job, while others work on the job every other day.

This newspaper, Guangzhou, March 31st: More than 30 people, including the deputy director, Communist Youth League deputy secretary, engineers, section chiefs, and technicians of the State-owned Guangzhou Paper Mill, went deep into various workshops in early March to work on the job, and the effect was very good.

    新的领导方法　新的生产关系
    上海沈阳天津广州一千多个单位实行跟班劳动
    据新华社上海30日电　上海国棉二厂在整风运动中大胆地革新了企业管理组织和政治工作方法。厂的管理组织由原来的厂、工场、车间三级制改为厂、工场两级制；党、行政、工会和团的组织，都按三个轮班组成，以适应棉纺织厂三班轮流生产的特点。支部书记全部回到生产岗位，管理干部跟班工作，跟班参加劳动。
    3月17日中共上海市委在国棉二厂召开现场会议，介绍了该厂的经验。两星期来，已有一百多个工厂学习国棉二厂的经验，结合本厂的生产特点，改革生产管理组织和实行干部随班工作、随班劳动。中共上海市委昨天第二次在国棉二厂召开现场会议，专门交流了各厂推广的经验。
    根据几个厂的介绍，现在实行干部跟班工作的厂大约有两种情况。一种是同国棉二厂相似的大型厂，改革以后，管理组织层次减少，机构精简，管理人员由原来占职工总人数的百分之十几，下降到6％、7％。单纯生产纱和线的国棉七厂，更进一步实行了由总工程师和厂长直接带班制，他们分别固定跟一个生产班工作，直接领导工人生产。科室中的计划、劳动科部分干部和供应科的材料员等，都深入到生产班去做计划、劳动工作和掌握材料消耗定额，厂部科室只留下少数干部作计划的综合平衡工作。这样，就使科室工作跟生产完全结合起来，管理干部在全厂总人数中所占的比例，也从整风前的12.1％下降到4.5％。
    另一种情况是只有职工百名上下的小厂，以公私合营光华电镀厂为代表。这个厂本身只有四十五位职工，加上两个卫星厂共八十九人。改革以后，公方厂长和中共支部书记、副书记全部随班生产，只在每周内抽出一天时间处理行政和党的事务；六个职员中留下三人管理日常行政，也定期参加劳动，其余三人下放到车间当工人。
    从最近短短时期里涌现出来的大量事实，雄辩地说明这样的大胆改革，使管理组织真正面向生产，根本改变了过去二十四小时的生产有十六小时无人负责的状况，工人群众欢迎，干部也找到了又红又专的道路。工人们称赞这样的改革是整风和“双反”运动带来的硕果。
    中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显和马天水昨天在会上指出：全市所有三班制和两班制生产的厂，都应该学习国棉二厂干部随班工作的经验。尽管各厂的具体条件不一样，跟班的方式可以不同，但是随班参加劳动这一点，所有的厂都不应当例外。
    本报讯　据沈阳日报报道：截至3月24日的不完全统计，沈阳市已有八百零七个单位搞起了一千四百三十个“试验田”；二千八百八十九名领导同志深入到车间跟班生产，参加劳动；六百七十四位领导干部搬到工人住宅区去落了户，这一行动得到了职工的普遍欢迎。
    本报天津31日电　天津市已有六百多个工厂的一千八百多名领导干部，学习天津市第二印染厂的经验实行了“跟班劳动”。各工厂因为大小不同，技术高低不一，设备条件和产品的复杂程度有区别，所以具体做法也不一样。有的工厂领导干部是每天跟班劳动几小时，有的厂是隔日跟班劳动。
    本报广州31日电　国营广州造纸厂的副厂长、团委副书记、工程师、科长、技术员等三十多人，3月初起深入各车间去跟班劳动，效果很好。
