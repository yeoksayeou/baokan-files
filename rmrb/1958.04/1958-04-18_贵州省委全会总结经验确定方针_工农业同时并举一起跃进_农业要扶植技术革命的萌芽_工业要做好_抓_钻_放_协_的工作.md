Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang Electric Dispatch: At a time when agriculture and industry are both leaping forward, timely summarizing of experiences, affirming achievements, and clearly pointing out the future direction and specific tasks that should be resolutely completed is the basic characteristic of the Sixth Plenary Committee Meeting (Enlarged) recently held by the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee.

This meeting deeply discussed and analyzed the development situation of the socialist construction upsurge in Guizhou Province since last winter. The meeting unanimously agreed that during this period, Party committees at all levels throughout the province have strived to keep up with the rapidly advancing situation of socialist construction, standing at the forefront of the high tide to lead the movement forward, and fully leveraging the enthusiasm and creativity of people of all ethnic groups in building socialism. Therefore, the province has achieved great success in all aspects of work during this period. In agriculture, completed water conservancy projects can now irrigate 18.39 million mu of farmland, exceeding the total of farmland water conservancy projects built in the province during the First Five-Year Plan period; the accumulation of various natural fertilizers has reached 893.6 billion jin, with an average of 28,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu throughout the province; preliminary statistics show that 4.8 million mu of barren soil has been improved; in suitable afforestation areas, 39.03 million mu of saplings have been planted and tree seeds sown; according to statistics from the Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, the South Guizhou Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, and the Bijie Special District alone, 18,607 kilometers of rural simple roads and cart tracks have been built; reforms of various farm tools and transportation tools have also achieved significant results. In terms of local industry, preliminary statistics as of the end of March show that special districts and counties have built and put into production 1,534 factories. In addition, the work of eliminating the four pests has been actively carried out during this period, and preliminary statistics show that more than 116.51 million sparrows and rats have been eliminated.

According to the recent instructions of the Central Government and the new situation of the great leap forward in production in Guizhou Province, the meeting believes that the province must currently strive to implement the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture under the task of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, with full of energy and striving for the best. At present, in agricultural production, we must quickly shift to focusing on sowing work, with other work revolving around sowing work. In order to do a good job in spring plowing and lay the foundation for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, leaders at all levels must now firmly grasp the central links of carrying out spring plowing production early, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, applying more fertilizer, carrying out close planting, and carrying out technological revolution. The meeting believes that we should now seize the sprouts of technological revolution and vigorously promote the improvement of agricultural tools and advanced agricultural technologies. The meeting also proposed that attention should be paid to adjusting the rhythm of production. On the issue of developing local industry, we must resolutely implement the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running industry. We must quickly allocate cadres to run industry and do everything possible to solve the difficulties of lacking machinery and equipment and technical strength. The vast mountainous areas of Guizhou are rich in various mineral resources, agricultural and sideline products, and various local and special products. The resource conditions for developing industry are very good. As long as the whole Party and the whole people are full of revolutionary drive and bravely advance, and Party committees at all levels do a good job of grasping (earnestly grasping the issue of developing industry), drilling (studying technology), releasing (doing a good job of decentralization, and letting go to develop local industry), and coordinating (strengthening cooperation between old and new factories, between regions, and between this province and other provinces), we can definitely quickly change the backward face of industry.

In order to better lead future industrial and agricultural production, leaders at all levels should quickly improve their political and ideological level and the level of Marxist-Leninist theory. To this end, the meeting pointed out that the struggle against waste and conservatism must be carried out thoroughly, eliminating official airs, lethargy, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, and cultivating a spirit of catching up with and learning from the advanced among cadres and masses throughout the province. Leading cadres at all levels, especially the responsible comrades of the provincial and local party committees, must strive to study theory, quickly improve their ability to analyze problems, and improve their working methods to adapt to the needs of the new situation. The meeting also preliminarily decided to start publishing a theoretical journal in the third quarter, with responsible comrades of party committees at all levels as the main contributors.

    贵州省委全会总结经验确定方针
    工农业同时并举一起跃进
    农业要扶植技术革命的萌芽　工业要做好“抓”“钻”“放”“协”的工作
    新华社贵阳电　在农业和工业同时飞跃前进的时候，及时总结经验，肯定成绩，并明确指出今后前进的方向和应该坚决完成的具体任务。这是中共贵州省委最近召开的第六次全体委员会议（扩大）的基本特点。
    这次会议深入地讨论和分析了贵州省从去冬以来的社会主义建设高潮的发展形势。会议一致认为在这个时期，全省各级党委都努力跟上了社会主义建设飞跃前进的形势，作到站在高潮前头来领导运动前进，充分地发挥了各族人民建设社会主义的积极性和创造性。因此，这个时期全省各项工作都取得了巨大的成绩。在农业方面，现已完工的水利工程共可灌溉一千八百三十九万亩农田，超过了全省在第一个五年计划期间兴修的农田水利工程的总和；积制的各种自然肥料已达八千九百三十六亿斤，全省平均每亩可施肥二万八千斤；改良瘠瘦的土壤，据初步统计已达四百八十万亩；在宜林地区栽植树苗和播种树子，已达三千九百零三万亩；修筑的乡村简易公路和大车道，仅据黔东南苗族侗族自治州、黔南布依族苗族自治州和毕节专区的统计，已达一万八千六百零七十公里；改革各种农具和交通运输工具等工作，也取得了显著的成绩。在地方工业方面，据截至3月底的初步统计，专区和县已建成投入生产的工厂有一千五百三十四个。此外，这个时期也积极开展了除四害工作，据初步统计，已消灭麻雀、老鼠一亿一千六百五十一万多只。
    根据中央最近的指示精神和贵州省生产大跃进的新情况，会议认为，当前全省必须在鼓足干劲、力争上游、又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义的任务下，努力贯彻执行工业和农业同时并举的方针。目前在农业生产上，必须迅速转向以播种工作为中心，其他工作围绕播种工作进行。为了作好春耕生产，打下今年农业生产大丰收的基础，各级领导现在必须紧紧抓住提早进行春耕生产、深耕细作、多施肥料、进行密植和进行技术革命等中心环节。会议认为当前就要抓紧技术革命的萌芽，大力推广改良农具和农业的先进技术。会议还提出应该注意调整生产节奏。目前在发展地方工业问题上，必须坚决贯彻全党全民办工业的方针，要迅速调配办工业的干部队伍，想尽一切办法解决机器设备和技术力量缺乏的困难。贵州广大山区内，各种矿藏丰富，农副业产品和各种土特产品也很丰富，发展工业的资源条件很好，只要全党全民鼓足革命干劲，奋勇前进，各级党委做好抓（把发展工业问题认真抓起来）、钻（钻研技术）、放（做好下放工作，放手发展地方工业），协（老厂与新厂，地区与地区，本省与外省加强协作），一定可以迅速改变工业落后的面貌。
    为了更好地领导今后的工农业生产，各级领导应迅速提高政治思想水平和马列主义理论水平。为此，会议指出，必须把反浪费反保守的斗争进行彻底，打掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，在全省干部和群众中养成赶先进、学先进的风气。各级领导干部，特别是省、地方两级党委的负责同志，都必须努力学习理论，迅速提高分析问题的能力，改进工作方法，以适应新形势的需要。会议并初步确定在第三季度开始出版理论杂志，主要撰稿人是各级党委的负责同志。
