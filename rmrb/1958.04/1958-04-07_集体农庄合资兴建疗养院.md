Collective Farms Jointly Build Sanatorium

    Two years ago, the "Motherland" Collective Farm in Yegorlyksky District, Rostov Oblast, made an unusual decision at a meeting of its members: "The collective farm will build its own sanatorium in Pyatigorsk, a famous resort in the Caucasus." Building a sanatorium more than three hundred kilometers away from the farm was, of course, not something one farm could handle on its own, so the "Motherland" Farm decided to join forces with neighboring farms to build it together. Seven farms gladly agreed to the "Motherland's" initiative. Thus, these eight farms formed a sanatorium construction committee and immediately set to work.
    Now, the collective farms' sanatorium has been completed. It is located on the beautiful and quiet Lermontov Street in the center of Pyatigorsk, a light pink three-story building (see picture). It can accommodate eighty farm members for recuperation, and up to one hundred people in the summer.
    This new sanatorium does not yet have a name. But the local residents know that it was jointly built by the farmers of Rostov Oblast, so they affectionately call this sanatorium the "Don" Sanatorium.

    集体农庄合资兴建疗养院
    两年以前，罗斯托夫州叶果尔雷克区的“祖国”集体农庄，在庄员大会上作出了一项不平常的决定：“集体农庄在高加索著名的疗养胜地比亚齐哥尔斯克自建一所疗养院”。在距离农庄三百多公里的地方建筑疗养院，当然不是一个农庄能够胜任的，所以“祖国”农庄决定联合邻近农庄合资兴建。七个农庄欣然同意了“祖国”的倡议。于是这八个农庄组成了疗养院建筑委员会，立即着手行动起来。
    现在，农庄的疗养院已经落成。它座落在比亚齐哥尔斯克市中心优美宁静的莱蒙托夫大街上，是一座淡粉色的三层楼房（见图）。它可以容纳八十个庄员疗养，夏季可以容纳到一百人。
    这座新的疗养院如今还没有名字。但当地居民知道是罗斯托夫州的农民自己合资建筑的，就亲切地叫这个疗养院为“顿河”疗养院。
