Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 4th: Representatives from five groups, including the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, the Japan Peace Committee, the Executive Committee for the Memorial Service for Chinese Martyrs, and the Liaison Council of Returnees from China, visited Aiichi Kiichi, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Japanese government, on the 2nd, demanding that the Japanese government be responsible for handling the Liu Lianren incident.

Aiichi Kiichi told the representatives of the five groups that the Japanese government intends to acknowledge the suffering Liu Lianren has endured for more than a decade; the Japanese government is "considering" expressing "regret" to him and giving him "appropriate consolation money," and sending him back to China. However, Aiichi Kiichi vehemently denied the fact that Liu Lianren was abducted to Japan during the war by Japanese militarists and forced to do hard labor in Japanese mines, attempting to shirk the responsibility that the Japanese government should bear in the Liu Lianren incident.

    日中友协等五个团体
    要求政府妥善对待刘连仁
    据新华社4日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会、恢复日中邦交国民会议、日本和平委员会、中国殉难烈士慰灵实行委员会和中国归还者联络会等五个团体的代表，在2日访问了日本政府内阁官房长官爱知揆一，要求日本政府负责处理刘连仁事件。
    爱知揆一向五个团体的代表表示，日本政府有意承认刘连仁十几年来所受到的痛苦；日本政府在“考虑”向他表示“遗憾”和给他“适当的慰问金”，并且把他送回中国。但是，爱知揆一却极力抵赖刘连仁是在战时被日本军国主义分子掳劫到日本，并且被强迫到日本矿山中做苦工的事实，企图借以推卸日本政府在刘连仁事件上应负的责任。
