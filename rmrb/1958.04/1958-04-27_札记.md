	The Prime Minister and the Base
	U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense John Irwin recently stated publicly that the United States wants to establish nuclear weapons bases in Japan. However, he also seemed to feel that this matter would be difficult to accomplish, because the Japanese people are very "sensitive" about the base issue. Therefore, Irwin pinned his hopes on Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi and the Liberal Democratic Party. He said that the U.S. State Department "hopes" that Kishi Nobusuke's party can win an "absolute majority" in the next election, so that Kishi Nobusuke can adopt a "more bold attitude" on the issue of "defense."

	We will not discuss whether the "hopes" of the U.S. State Department can be realized. What is worth pondering is that Irwin's remarks provide Japanese voters with some material. It at least shows that the issue of Kishi Nobusuke's return to power is related to the issue of the United States establishing nuclear weapons bases in Japan.

	An Unpleasant Visit
	In order to "restore American prestige in South America," U.S. Vice President Nixon decided to visit South American countries recently. However, even many American newspapers believe that Nixon's mission will be difficult to accomplish. The New York "World-Telegram and Sun" wrote: "On the surface, everything will be arranged very pleasantly, but in secret, Mr. Nixon will hear complaints and dissatisfaction with the United States."

	In fact, the "complaints and dissatisfaction" of the South American people with the United States have long ceased to be "in secret." The recent reaction caused by the United States' intention to increase import taxes on Chilean copper is one example. Chilean Congressman Ulloa openly condemned the United States, saying that this measure is "tantamount to aggression against our country." Obviously, it is impossible for an aggressor to restore "prestige" in front of the people who have been invaded. It is certain that Nixon's visit to South America will be "unpleasant" for both the South American people and himself!

    首相和基地
    美国国防部助理部长帮办约翰·欧文最近公开表示，美国想在日本建立核武器基地。不过，他似乎也感到，这件事是不大好办的，因为日本人民对基地问题非常“敏感”。于是，欧文就把希望寄托在岸信介首相和自由民主党的身上。他说，美国国务院“希望”岸信介的党能够在下届大选中获得“绝对多数”，这样岸信介就能够对“防御”问题采取“比较大胆的态度”了。
    美国国务院的“希望”能否实现，我们姑且不去谈它。值得玩味的是，欧文的这段话倒是给日本选民提供了一个材料，它至少说明岸信介重新上台的问题，同美国在日本建立核武器基地的问题，是有某种联系的。
  不愉快的访问
    为了“挽回美国在南美洲的威信”，美国副总统尼克松决定最近去访问南美各国。可是，就连许多美国报纸也认为，尼克松的这个使命是很难完成的。纽约“世界电讯与太阳报”写道：“在表面上一切都会安排得很愉快，可是在暗中，尼克松先生听到的将是对美国的抱怨和不满。”
    其实，南美洲人民对美国的“抱怨和不满”早就不是“在暗中”了。美国最近打算提高智利铜的进口税所引起的反应，就是一个例子。智利众议员乌约阿公开谴责美国说：这种措施“无异于对我国的侵略”。很明显，一个侵略者要想在被侵略的人们面前挽回“威信”，这是不可能的。可以肯定，尼克松到南美的访问，不论对南美人民来说，还是对他自己来说，都将是不“愉快”的！
