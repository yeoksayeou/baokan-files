Talking about "Breaking Bowl Flower"
Wang Wencai, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Since the "Breaking Bowl Flower" was introduced in the newspaper, it has aroused the interest of many readers. Now, I will make some supplementary introductions.

"Breaking Bowl Flower" is a plant of the genus Anemone in the family Ranunculaceae, with the scientific name "Anemone hupehensis V. Lemoine (Latin, same below)". Most species of the genus Anemone are relatively small herbs, with hairless pistils and fruits, or with sparse short hairs. However, the "Breaking Bowl Flower" grows taller, up to four feet five inches. At the same time, its pistils and fruits are covered with extremely dense long villi, and many small fruits gather into a ball, like a ball of cotton. Therefore, some places call it "Wild Cotton" (such as Sichuan, Guizhou), or "Cotton Grass" (such as Sichuan).

"Breaking Bowl Flower" is distributed in the Yangtze River Basin and the Yue River Basin of China (Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Jiangsu), growing on grassy slopes or fieldsides and roadsides below 2,400 meters above sea level. It blooms in autumn (July to October), with white or light purple flowers, five perianth segments, 2.5 to 3.5 cm long, which are very beautiful and can be used for viewing.

There is also a cultivated variety called Autumn Anemone (Var. japonica (Thbg.) Bowel et stearn), with up to twenty perianth segments, of which the purple or reddish-purple ones are especially beautiful, and are garden treasures. It is cultivated in Yunnan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and Japan.

There are eighty species in the genus Anemone (forty species in China), of which two are similar to "Breaking Bowl Flower". One is Da Huo Cao (A. tomentosa (Maxim) pei), which looks almost identical to "Breaking Bowl Flower", except that the underside of the leaves has very dense white villi. (In Neiqiu, Hebei, the locals use this hair to strike flint to smoke, calling it "Huo Ge Dan"). Its distribution is from Yunnan northward to the Yellow River Basin (Yunnan, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, Hebei), growing on grassy slopes or sunny edges of forests below 2,000 meters (sometimes up to 3,000 meters) above sea level. It also blooms from July to October.

Another species is Wild Cotton (A. vitifolia Buch—Ham), which is also very similar to the previous two, except that its leaves are like grape leaves, single leaves, while the leaves of the previous two are divided into three leaflets, which are compound leaves. This species is distributed in southwestern China (Yunnan, Sichuan) and the Himalayas.

These three plants can be used as medicine. Wu Qijun of the Ming Dynasty recorded wild cotton in his book "Illustrated Compendium of Materia Medica": "Wild cotton, Yunnan Materia Medica, tastes bitter, cold in nature, poisonous, lowers qi, kills insects: good for children with pinworms and roundworms invading the stomach." Professor Pei Jian, director of Nanjing Zhongshan Botanical Garden, has conducted investigations on these plants. He believes that the so-called "Wild Cotton" sold in pharmacies and by herbal medicine practitioners is actually not Wild Cotton, but commonly uses similar substitute plants or mixes them together. However, since the species are similar, the medicinal properties are also similar. He also mentioned that "Breaking Bowl Flower" is often sold by herbal medicine practitioners as a medicine for treating mad dog bites (see Pei Jian: "Chinese Medicinal Plants", Volume 1).

From the similar medicinal properties of the three plants, it can be inferred that Da Huo Cao and Wild Cotton may also have the effect of killing mosquitoes and flies. Ranunculaceae plants are widely distributed in China and have many species, many of which are poisonous plants, such as Aconitum, Cimicifuga, Ranunculus, etc. We can study and test their toxic effects on killing mosquitoes and flies, so that these poisonous weeds can serve mankind.

    谈“打破碗花花”
    中国科学院植物研究所　王文采
    “打破碗花花”在报上介绍后，引起许多读者的兴趣，现在再作些补充介绍。
    “打破碗花花”是毛茛科银莲花属的植物，学名是“Anemone hupehensis V．Lemoine（拉丁文，下同）”。银莲花属的大多数种都是较矮小的草本植物，雌蕊和果实无毛或生有较稀疏的短毛。但是“打破碗花花”都长得较高大，高达四尺五寸；同时它的雌蕊和果实都生有极密的长绒毛，许多小果实聚成一个球，好像一团棉花，所以有些地方人们叫它“野棉花”（如四川、贵州），或“棉花草”（如四川）。
    “打破碗花花”分布在我国长江流域和粤江流域（云南、四川、陕西、湖北、贵州、湖南、广西、广东、江苏），生长在二千四百公尺以下的山地草坡或田边、路边，在秋季（7月到10月）开花，花白色或淡紫色，花被片五枚，长2.5到3.5厘米，很美丽，可供观赏。
    它还有一个栽培的变种叫秋牡丹（Var．japonica（Thbg．）Bowel et stearn），花被片多到二十枚，其中紫色或红紫色的尤为美丽，为庭园珍品。在我国云南、江西、安徽、江苏以及日本都有栽培。
    银莲花属计八十种（我国有四十种），其中和“打破碗花花”相近的有两种。一种是大火草（A．tomentosa（Maxim）pei），它长得和“打破碗花花”几乎完全相同，不同的是叶下面生有很密的白色绒毛（河北内丘一带老乡用这种毛打火石吸烟，叫它“火格蛋”；它的分布是从云南向北到黄河流域（云南、四川、甘肃、陕西、河南、山西、河北），生长于二千公尺（有时到三千公尺）以下的山地草坡或林边阳处，也在7月到10月开花。
    另一种是野棉花（A．vitifolia Buch—Ham），它和前两种也很相似，不同处是它的叶子像葡萄的叶子，是单叶，而前两种的叶子分裂为三个小叶，是复叶。这种分布于我国西南（云南、四川）和喜马拉雅山。
    这三种植物都可以做药，明代吴其浚在他著的“植物名实图考”中记载过野棉花：“野棉花，滇本草，味苦性寒，有毒，下气、杀虫：小儿寸白虫、蚘虫，犯胃用，良。”南京中山植物园主任裴鉴教授对这几种植物曾经作过调查，他认为：现在药铺和经营草药者所售的所谓“野棉花”，实际不是野棉花，而是常用野棉花种相近的代替植物或混杂一起。但是种类既近，药性也就相似。他还提到“打破碗花花”常被经营草药者作为治疯狗咬伤的药出售（见裴鉴：“中国药用植物志”第一册）。
    从三种植物的药性相近，可以推测大火草和野棉花也很可能有杀蚊蝇的效力。毛茛科植物在我国分布很广，种类也很多，其中有不少有毒植物，如乌头、升麻、毛茛等，都可以研究、试验它们杀蚊蝇的毒效，好让这些毒草为人类服务。
