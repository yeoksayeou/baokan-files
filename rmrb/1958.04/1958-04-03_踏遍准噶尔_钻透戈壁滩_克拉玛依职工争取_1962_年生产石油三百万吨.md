Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 2nd: In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, workers in the Karamay Mining Area have proposed: To work hard for five years to make the Karamay Oilfield a petroleum base with an annual output of three million tons by 1962.

Based on this Great Leap Forward battle cry, workers have recently revised the oil exploration and production plan targets for this year. The new targets propose that the total drilling footage in this mining area this year should increase by 180.3% compared to last year, and increase by 46.3% compared to this year's national plan; crude oil production should increase by 469.2% compared to last year, and increase by 118.5% compared to this year's national plan. The workers also proposed a friendly competition with Yumen Oil Mine, Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau, Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau, and Dushanzi Mining Area based on this leap forward plan.

The Karamay Mining Area workers' enthusiasm for the Great Leap Forward in production was sparked at their recent Representative Conference of Advanced Producers. This conference adopted a combination of in-conference and out-of-conference methods. During the day, representatives held meetings to oppose conservatism, tap potential, and discuss leap forward targets. In the evening, the conference's real-time situation was transmitted to their respective units. As a result, within a few days, an unprecedented revolutionary zeal emerged in all directions of the mining area. After the leap forward target of increasing the total drilling footage for the entire mining area by 46.3% compared to this year's national plan was proposed, the drilling teams in the First Production Area immediately proposed to increase the average monthly drilling speed of the drilling rig from the 626 meters stipulated in the national plan to 900 meters. Subsequently, the drilling teams in the Second Production Area surpassed the First Production Area's teams with a maximum average speed target of drilling 1,100 meters per month.

The Zhang Yunqing team, which was rated as an advanced drilling team in the entire mining area, became the target of competition for each drilling team. Within a few days, this team revised its leap forward plan three times, increasing the annual drilling footage target from 8,300 meters to 9,600 meters, and then to 10,000 meters. However, this target, which had been revised three times, was then overwhelmed by the 1216 drilling team's proposed target of drilling four and a half wells in four months and drilling 11,000 meters in a year.

The revolutionary enthusiasm of young workers of all ethnic groups is even higher. They are singing songs filled with heroic spirit: "Treading across the Junggar Basin, Drilling through the Gobi Desert; Unfazed by wind, snow, severe cold, and heat; One person does the work of two, One day is better than two; After five years of hard work, the Gobi will change its appearance." They also recently held a mobilization rally to promote the Great Leap Forward in production. The youth of the entire mining area will save 5 million yuan in funds for the country throughout the year in their work. (Attached picture)

### 踏遍准噶尔　钻透戈壁滩  克拉玛依职工争取1962年生产石油三百万吨

    踏遍准噶尔　钻透戈壁滩
    克拉玛依职工争取1962年生产石油三百万吨
    据新华社乌鲁木齐2日电　克拉玛依矿区职工在反浪费、反保守运动中提出：要苦战五年，到1962年使克拉玛依油田成为年产三百万吨的石油基地。
    根据这个大跃进的战斗口号，最近职工们重新修订了今年的石油勘探和生产计划指标。新指标提出，今年这个矿区的钻井总进尺要比去年增加180.3％，比今年国家计划提高46.3％；原油产量要比去年增加469.2％，比今年国家计划提高118.5％。职工们并且以这个跃进计划向玉门油矿、青海石油勘探局、四川石油勘探局和独山子矿区倡议开展友谊竞赛。
    克拉玛依矿区职工们的生产大跃进的干劲，是在他们最近举行的先进生产者代表大会上掀起的。这个大会采取了会内和会外结合的方式，白天代表们在会上反保守、挖潜力、讨论跃进指标，晚上便把大会的实况传达到本单位。因而在几天之内，矿区四面八方都出现了空前未有的革命干劲。矿区全年钻井总进尺比今年国家计划提高46.3％的跃进指标提出以后，第一生产区的钻井队立即提出要把平均钻机月速度从国家计划规定的六百二十六公尺跃进到九百公尺；接着，第二生产区的钻井队又以每月钻进一千一百公尺的最高平均速度指标，把第一生产区的井队抛在后面。
    被评为全矿区先进钻井队的张云清队成了各个井队竞赛的对象。这个井队在几天之内修改了三次跃进计划，使全年钻井进尺指标由八千三百公尺跃进到九千六百公尺，再跃进到一万公尺。但这个经过三次修订的指标，接着又被一二一六井队提出四个月钻四口半井；一年钻进一万一千公尺的指标压倒了。
    各族青年职工的革命干劲更是高涨。他们唱着：“踏遍准噶尔，钻透戈壁滩；风雪严寒热，把它不在眼；一人顶两人，一天赛两天，苦战五年后，戈壁改容颜”的充满英雄气概的歌曲，并且在最近举行了促进生产大跃进的誓师大会。全矿区青年全年要在工作中为国家节约五百万元资金。（附图片）
