Xinghua's Experience in High-Yielding Rapeseed
Wang Yixiang, Deputy Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture

    A field visit to Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, to observe their rapeseed cultivation experience has shattered the "mystery" of whether rapeseed yields are stable and whether high yields are possible, and has uncovered the "key" to achieving a leap in rapeseed production. Last year, the county's rapeseed planting area was over 52,000 mu, an increase of 70% compared to 1952; the yield per mu was 185.4 jin, 1.45 times that of 1952; and the total output was 9,745,000 jin, 3.3 times that of 1952. Xinghua, while prioritizing the development of grain, has expanded its rapeseed area year by year, and the yield per mu has rapidly increased year by year. The experience gained is very rich, and the main points are three:

    First, Xinghua's experience proves that as long as people have enthusiasm, rapeseed can achieve high yields. Xinghua County plants rapeseed in the Duotian area, which has relatively favorable conditions for soil, water sources, and mud fertilizer; however, frost damage and pests are roughly the same as in other regions, and frost damage is even more severe than in southern Jiangsu. In particular, the Duotian area has interlaced lakes and rivers, and the land is scattered, making rapeseed planting operations and the labor required more difficult than in plains or polders. For example, Duotian soil is loose and the terrain is about three meters above the water surface, with water evaporating on all five sides and planting on all five sides, the amount of irrigation work is very large, but they do not adopt the passive method of planting drought-resistant and low-yielding crops, but instead adopt the active method of frequent and abundant watering. A single season of rapeseed uses as much as 68,000 jin of water per mu, and the annual water consumption per mu will reach 200,000 jin; especially in the later stage, each mu is applied with as much as 60,000 jin of mud slurry. In 1954, severe frost damage killed 40% of the rapeseed seedlings. From the remaining plants, they carefully selected and determined the varieties, and found the correct direction for hybridizing high-yielding varieties and cold-resistant varieties. At the same time, lake waves and rainwater erosion are relatively severe, and the work of tidying up the land to maintain and expand the cultivated area is also not found in other places. The people of Xinghua Duotian area faced their own favorable conditions squarely, and relied on their own hard work and wisdom to overcome a series of difficulties and achieve large-scale high yields of rapeseed. From this, it can be seen that enthusiasm is a source of power for rapeseed yields to achieve a leap forward.

    Second, the characteristic of the Xinghua County Party Committee's leadership in rapeseed production is that on the one hand, it strengthens political and ideological education on the consistency of increasing oil crop production with the interests of the state, the collective, and individuals, and at the same time, it appoints a deputy county magistrate and technicians to establish a specialized organization to strengthen the business and technical guidance of rapeseed production. On the other hand, it resolutely implements the policy of rewarding a certain amount of oil coupons for over-production and over-selling of rapeseed, so that political work, business guidance, and economic work are closely integrated to serve the promotion of production.

    Third, several major experiences in rapeseed cultivation in Xinghua County are also of universal significance. For example: ? The heterosis after crossing the high-yielding "Piao'erbai" variety with the cold-resistant "Qingyang'ertou" variety is utilized to create a foundation for ensuring seedling survival through the winter and obtaining high yields (of course, this aspect still needs to be further improved). ? In order to adapt to the three-crop season (rapeseed, taro, Chinese cabbage) cultivation system, staggered seedling raising is adopted to cultivate strong seedlings, transplanting and staggered transplanting are comprehensively promoted, and the contradictions in the connection between the preceding and following crops of the three-crop season are properly resolved. ? Dense planting and uniform thinning, with more than 12,000 plants per mu. ? Four applications of mud slurry fertilizer are applied according to the growth and development needs of rapeseed in the later stage, to achieve the goal of "stable roots," "branching," "flowering to the top," and "seed setting like fish eyes." ? In the harvest season, the experience of pulling up plants with soil, striving for post-ripening, cross-stacking in clusters, and careful threshing is also created for a bumper harvest. All of this makes people completely convinced that they have indeed grasped the key to increasing rapeseed production, demonstrated consistent enthusiasm, and implemented the policy of diligent and thrifty farming and meticulous farming. In particular, the latter two experiences are very urgent measures to strive for a great leap forward in rapeseed production this year.

    After further summarizing its own experience and inspecting the current rapeseed production, the Xinghua County Party Committee called on the entire county to launch a concentrated effort to cultivate rapeseed in the later stage. It called on every commune in the county to plant castor beans, and every team to plant sunflowers, and launched a "ten plants and one hundred plants per household" campaign, striving to double the oil crop output this year.

    At present, it is the time for rapeseed management and the upcoming sowing of summer and autumn oil crops. We should earnestly learn from Xinghua County's enthusiasm in developing oil crops and learn from Xinghua's creative spirit in cultivating oil crops, to ensure the increased production of oil crops this year.

    兴化油菜高产的经验
    江苏省农业厅副厅长　王一香
    现场参观了江苏兴化县油菜栽培经验，打破了人们对于油菜产量是否稳定、是否可以高产的“谜”，揭开了油菜产量可以跃进的“窍”。这个县去年油菜种植面积五万二千多亩，比1952年扩大70％；单产一百八十五点四斤，为1952年的一点四五倍；总产量为九百七十四万五千斤，为1952年的三点三倍。兴化在优先发展粮食的同时，油菜的面积逐年扩大，单产逐年迅速提高，所取得的经验是十分丰富的，主要的有三点：
    第一，兴化经验证明了，只要人们有干劲，油菜是可以高产的。兴化县在垛田地区种植油菜，土壤、水源、泥肥等具有比较有利的条件；但是，冻害、病虫害都和其他地区大体相同，其中冻害要比苏南更厉害些。尤其是垛田地区湖河交叉，土地零星分散，种植油菜的操作上和所需要的劳力方面比平原或圩田困难更多。比如垛田土质松，地势高出水面三公尺左右，水分五面蒸发，五面种植，浇水工作量很大，但他们不是采取消极的种植抗旱低产作物的办法，而是采用多浇水勤浇水的积极办法，单油菜一季用水每亩即达六万八千斤，全年每亩用水将达二十万斤；特别是后期每亩施用泥浆就达六万斤。1954年严重的冻害，油菜死苗40％，他们从残留的植株中，细心精选核定品种，找出了高产品种和抗寒品种杂交的正确方向。同时，湖浪和雨水冲刷比较厉害，为保持和扩大耕地面积而需要整理土地的工作，也是其他地方所没有的。兴化垛田地区人民正视自己的有利条件，和依靠自己的勤劳和智慧，克服了一系列的困难，取得了油菜大面积的丰产。由此可见，干劲就是油菜产量获得跃进力量的一个源泉。
    第二，兴化县委对油菜生产领导的特点，就是一方面加强增产油料对国家、集体、个人利益一致性的政治思想教育，同时又指定一个副县长和技术员，成立了专门的组织，加强油菜生产的业务和技术指导，一方面又坚决执行了对超产超售菜子任务的就奖励一定数量油票的政策，使政治工作、业务指导、经济工作紧密结合，为促进生产服务。
    第三，兴化县油菜栽培方面几个主要经验也是有普遍意义的。比如：?利用了高产的“瓢儿白”品种与耐寒的“青羊儿头”品种杂交后的杂种优势，为保苗越冬和获得高产创造了基础（当然这方面还需要继续提高）。?为适应三大季（油菜、芋头、大白菜）栽培制度，而采取了分期育苗培育壮苗，全面推行移栽和分期移栽，妥善地解决了三大季前后作衔接上的矛盾。?密植匀苗，每亩一万二千株以上。?根据油菜后期生长发育需要而进行追施四次泥浆肥，达到“稳根”、“发杈”、“开花到顶”、“结子像鱼眼睛”的丰产目的。?在收割季节中也创造了带土拔株、争取后熟、交叉簇堆、精细脱粒的丰产丰收经验。所有这些，使人完全信服他们确是抓住了油菜增产的关键，表现一贯到底的干劲，贯彻勤俭种地、精细种地的方针。特别是后两条经验，是争取今年油菜产量大跃进的十分紧急的措施。
    兴化县委在进一步总结了自己的经验和检查了当前油菜生产以后，号召全县突击油菜的后期培植。号召全县社社种蓖麻，队队种葵花，开展每户十株百株运动，力争油料产量今年翻一翻。
    目前，正是油菜管理和夏秋油料作物即将播种的时间，我们应该认真学习兴化县发展油料作物的干劲，学习兴化栽培油料作物的创造精神，保证今年油料的增产。
