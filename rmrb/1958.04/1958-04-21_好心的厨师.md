    The other day, a friend from the Academy of Fine Arts told me that they are responding to the call for "combining work and study," and the entire faculty and students plan to create 200 sets of comic strips this year. What inspiring news this is! Aren't these easy-to-understand works exactly what the masses urgently need?
    However, just yesterday, someone told me that some publishing houses are afraid to freely enter into contracts with art schools to create comic strips, the reason being that they are afraid they cannot guarantee the quality they require. Hearing this news, I couldn't help but think of the story of the kind-hearted cook.
    Once upon a time, there was a kind-hearted cook who loved to eat white rice the most. So he made a vow to always cook white rice for people. He did it very well and was very popular. One day, the cook went to the warehouse to get white rice, but all the white rice was used up except for sorghum rice. The kind-hearted cook was worried. What to do? The new rice hasn't been harvested yet, what can we give everyone to eat? At this time, the sorghum rice looked at the worried cook and said anxiously, "Although we are coarse, we are very nutritious and can be used to satisfy hunger." The cook shook his head, thinking that sorghum rice would definitely not satisfy everyone's taste. But the people who were eating were already clamoring with hunger. It is said that later, because the cook was urged too much by the people who were eating, he had to process the sorghum rice finely and serve it to everyone, and was praised by the people who were eating.
    When the cook went back, he smiled to himself: "It turns out that the tastes of the people who are eating are not necessarily the same as mine!"
    I sincerely hope that the editors of publishing houses will not be such kind-hearted cooks, especially since these comic strips are not necessarily sorghum rice!

    好心的厨师
    曹作锐
    前天，美术学院有位朋友告诉我说，他们响应“勤工俭学”的号召，全院师生计划在今年创作连环画二百套。这是多么振奋人心的消息啊！这种通俗易懂的作品，不正是群众迫切需要的么？
    然而，就在昨天，又有人告诉我说，有些出版社不敢放手和美术院校普遍地订立创作连环画的合同，理由是怕不能保证他们要求的质量。听了这个消息，我不禁想起好心的厨师的故事。
    从前，有位好心的厨师最爱吃白米饭，于是他立了个志愿，要永远做白米饭给人吃。他做的很好，很受欢迎。有一天，厨师到仓库去取白米，但仓库里除了高粱米外，白米全用完了。好心的厨师发了愁，怎么办呢？新稻还没收下来，拿什么东西给大家吃呢？这时，高粱米看着愁容满面的厨师，发急地说：“我们虽然粗糙，但很有营养，可以用来充饥的。”厨师摇了摇头，他认为高粱米一定不能满足大家的口味。但是吃饭的人们已饿得嚷了起来，据说后来这位厨师因为吃饭的人催的太紧，只好将高粱米加工细做后端给大家吃，还受到了吃饭人的称赞。
    当厨师回去的时候，自己对自己笑了：“原来吃饭人的口味不一定都和我一样啊！”
    我深深地希望出版社的编辑们，不要做这样好心的厨师，何况这些连环画还不一定是高粱米哩！
