Moscow, April 14th (People's Daily) - The 13th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union (Komsomol) will open on April 15th. On the eve of the conference, our reporter interviewed Romanovsky, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol, and asked him about the preparations for the 13th Congress, the tasks of the conference, and the achievements of the Soviet Komsomol over the past four years.

Romanovsky said that the 13th Congress of the Soviet Komsomol, opening on April 15th, will summarize the work of the Komsomol since 1954. Over the past four years, the Komsomol has actively participated in communist construction. Members participated in the construction of hydroelectric power stations such as Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Kakhovka; 260,000 young people responded to the call to participate in various construction projects in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union; and in the Donbass, Komsomol members built 37 new coal mines in a short period of time, setting a world record for building a new coal mine in nine months. Because of these achievements, the Ukrainian Komsomol received the nation's highest award - the Order of Lenin. Not long ago, at the initiative of young workers in Grozny, a nationwide campaign to save steel and combat waste was launched. As of April 5th, Komsomol members had saved the state 5 billion rubles.

In the past four years, 350,000 young people have participated in the work of reclaiming virgin lands. They have played an important role in the struggle for grain. So far, more than 30,000 young men and women have received medals and awards. In addition, hundreds of thousands of young workers and students go to the newly cultivated areas every year to help with the harvest. 300,000 young people enthusiastically responded to the Party's call to participate in animal husbandry.

In terms of ideological education, the Komsomol has also made great achievements in the past four years. The education of young people has been further linked to production, and special attention has been paid to educating young people with the revolutionary traditions of the Soviet people. The Komsomol's organizational life has also become more active. At the same time, the number of full-time cadres in the League has been greatly reduced compared to the past, and many unnecessary meetings have been cancelled, giving young people time to do more work.

Comrade Romanovsky said that the contacts between Soviet youth and youth organizations in other countries are also expanding day by day. The 6th World Youth Festival held in Moscow in the summer of 1957 further consolidated the friendship with young people from various countries. Soviet youth now maintain regular contact with 550 youth organizations in 98 countries. The Soviet Komsomol has a deep and solid friendship with the Chinese Komsomol and the youth organizations of other socialist countries. Romanovsky concluded by saying that after this congress, all Soviet youth and all Komsomol members will definitely be able to give greater play to their strength, do a good job as the Party's assistants, and work with the people of the whole country to complete the basic economic tasks of the Soviet people as soon as possible.

    苏联青年以劳动成果迎接团代会
    罗曼诺夫斯基向本报记者谈四年来团的工作成就
    本报莫斯科14日电　苏联全苏列宁共产主义青年团的第十三次代表大会15日开幕。本报记者在会议开幕前夕访问了苏联共青团中央委员会书记处书记罗曼诺夫斯基，请他谈谈第十三次代表大会的准备情况、会议的任务和四年来苏联共青团的工作成绩。
    罗曼诺夫斯基说，4月15日召开的苏联共青团第十三次代表大会将总结共青团自1954年以来的工作。过去四年中，共青团积极地参加了共产主义建设工作。团员们参加了古比雪夫、斯大林格勒和卡霍夫卡等水电站的建设；二十六万青年响应号召参加了苏联东部地区的各项建设工程；在顿巴斯，共青团员们用很短的时间建成了三十七座新煤矿，创造了用九个月的时间就建成一座新煤矿的世界纪录。由于这些功绩，乌克兰共青团得到了国家的最高奖励——列宁勋章。不久前，在格罗兹内青年工人的倡议下，全苏展开了节约钢材反对浪费的运动。到4月5日为止，共青团员们已经为国家节省了五十亿卢布。
    在过去四年中，有三十五万青年参加了开垦生荒地的工作，在为粮食而斗争的工作中他们起了重要作用，到目前为止已有三万多男女青年得到了勋章和奖章。除此以外，每年还有数十万青年工人和学生到新垦区帮助收割。三十万青年热烈地响应了党的号召，参加了畜牧业的工作。
    在思想教育方面，共青团的工作四年来也有很大成绩。对青年的教育已经进一步同生产连系起来，并特别注意用苏联人民的革命传统教育青年。共青团的组织生活也更活跃了。同时，团的脱产干部较前大大减少，并取消了许多不必要的会议，使青年有时间作更多的工作。
    罗曼诺夫斯基同志说，苏联青年和各国青年组织的联系也正在一天天扩大。1957年夏天在莫斯科举行的第六届世界青年联欢节进一步巩固了同各国青年的友谊。苏联青年现在和九十八个国家的五百五十个青年组织保持着经常的联系。苏联共青团和中国共青团以及其他社会主义国家的青年组织有着深厚巩固的友谊。罗曼诺夫斯基最后说，经过这次代表大会全体苏联青年和全体共青团员一定能更加发挥自己的力量，作好党的助手的工作，和全国人民一起及早完成苏联人民的基本经济任务。
