Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing - Middle schools in Chongqing are universally adopting the method of forging ties and signing contracts with nearby industrial and agricultural production units to carry out work-study programs.

After the work-study activities were launched in various schools in March this year, students actively requested to participate in labor at factories, agricultural cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives. After understanding the significant meaning of work-study programs, workers and members of many factories, handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives actively supported them. Currently, students in suburban areas mostly attend classes five days a week and participate in agricultural labor one day. Students in urban and industrial/mining areas mostly take turns going to handicraft cooperatives and factories, working alongside workers in various workshops. A small number take work back to school to do in the practice factory or specially established after-school production workshops.

Students not only labor together with workers and farmers, but also help each other in learning science, technology, and cultural knowledge. Students at the 41st Middle School and workers act as teachers and students to each other and have jointly formulated a mutual teaching and learning plan. Students guarantee to teach workers cultural knowledge, and workers guarantee to pass on their skills to the students.

After teachers and students from various schools participated in industrial and agricultural production, the general teaching quality and learning quality have begun to improve. Teachers in the biology group at the 41st Middle School learned techniques such as fish farming, pig raising, and tree planting at the "East is Red" Agricultural Cooperative and the "July 1st" Agricultural Cooperative, further enriching the content of their teaching.

    重庆各中学和工农挂钩
    学生和工人农民订互教互学规划
    据新华社重庆讯　重庆市各中等学校普遍采用和附近工农业生产单位挂钩、订合同的办法，展开勤工俭学活动。
    今年3月份各校勤工俭学活动展开后，学生们纷纷请求到工厂和农业社、手工业社参加劳动。许多工厂、手工业社、农业社的工人和社员们了解了勤工俭学的重大意义后，都积极支持。目前，郊区学生每星期大都是五天上课，一天参加农业劳动。城区和工矿区的学生，多数轮流到手工业社、工厂，分散各车间与工人一起工作，少数把活领到校内在实习工厂或专设的课余生产车间做。
    学生们不仅与工人、农民一起劳动，还在学习科学、技术和文化知识方面相互帮助。第四十一中学的学生和工人互为师生，共同订出了互教互学的规划，学生保证教工人学习文化知识，工人保证把技术传给学生。
    各校教师、学生参加工农业生产后，一般教学质量和学习质量都开始提高。第四十一中学生物组的教师在“东方红”农业社和“七一”农业社学会了养鱼、养猪、种树等技术，更加充实了教学的内容。
