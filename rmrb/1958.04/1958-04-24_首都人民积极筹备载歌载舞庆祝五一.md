The Preparatory Committee for the celebration of "May 1st" International Labor Day, established at the end of March, has already carried out a series of preparatory work. Factories, shops, handicraft cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, government offices, schools, literary and art groups, and street organizations are all rushing to produce charts and models to present to the Party and state leaders in Tiananmen Square, to review their great achievements based on the victory of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle.

A feature of this year's parade is that many workers, farmers, students, and government cadres are preparing to participate in the parade with various musical instruments. The entire parade will be filled with singing and dancing, celebrating the new victories of socialism. In addition, athletes from the National Defense Sports Brigade will perform various demonstrations in the parade this year.

Reflecting the great leap forward in literary and artistic work, the programs of the literary and art teams are very rich. The drum and music ensemble from Xushui County, Hebei Province, and the "Xinzi" folk art from Shaanxi Province, will all participate in the "May 1st" parade.
