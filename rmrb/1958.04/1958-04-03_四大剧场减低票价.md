    Four Major Theaters Reduce Ticket Prices
    (Our report) To allow more people to enter the large theaters and see performances of dramas, operas, and music and dance, the four major theaters in Beijing have decided to reduce ticket prices starting this month. The lowest ticket prices are now as follows: Tianqiao Theater: large-scale operas and dance dramas have been reduced from 6 jiao to 3 jiao; music and dance performances have been reduced from 6 jiao to 4 jiao; concerts have been reduced from 4 jiao to 2 jiao. The ticket prices for dramas at the Capital Theater and the People's Theater have both been reduced from 6 jiao to 3 jiao. The Youth Art Theater, due to its smaller size, has reduced drama ticket prices from 6 jiao to 4 jiao.
    While reducing prices, the above four theaters have also increased the number of low-priced tickets and reduced the number of high-priced tickets compared to the original arrangement.
