The People's Daily Column:

    A farm tool reform movement centered on "eliminating shoulder carrying and realizing vehicular transport" is vigorously unfolding in the rural areas of Guangdong Province.

    The Hepu Special District, where the movement is progressing particularly quickly, has tens of thousands of farmers working hard for eight days and nights while also engaging in intense spring plowing. By the 27th, all counties and cities in the special district had achieved vehicular transport, except for the Ten Thousand Mountains Autonomous County, where road conditions made vehicle production difficult. Now, the number of vehicles in the area has surged from more than 80,000 before the 20th to more than 430,000, basically achieving one vehicle per household. In the Pearl River Delta region and the Shaoguan Special District, the broad masses of farmers have also launched a high tide of tool revolution, finding tricks and thinking of ways to improve and create tools. Some counties and districts have established "Farm Tool Reform Committees" or "Tool Reform Committees," hiring skilled workers from various handicraft cooperatives as consultants, extensively collecting opinions and requirements from the masses on tool reform, concentrating mass wisdom, and creating or improving farm tools for promotion. Panyu County launched a movement of "Everyone Contributes to the Thousand-Cattie County, Establishes Five Merits, and Offers Ten Plans," and established a prize evaluation committee to immediately congratulate and reward those who contribute to the reform of tools with gongs and drums. Based on this situation, the province's plan to eliminate shoulder carrying within two years can certainly be realized ahead of schedule.

    The creativity of the broad masses of farmers is diverse and colorful. The tools currently being promoted more widely include transportation tools such as "ox-drawn carts," "handcarts," "ox-drawn mud boats," and "aerial steel transportation lines," as well as new farm tools such as "harrowing machines," "adjustable row markers," "foundation smoothing devices," and "rice planting boats." These tools are characterized by simple manufacturing, convenient use, and high efficiency, which can greatly reduce the labor intensity of farmers and improve labor efficiency. For example, the flatbed cart made of old wood by the Daze First Cooperative in Xinhui County can transport 2,000 catties of fertilizer at a time, which is more than ten times faster than shoulder carrying. The "foundation smoothing device" created by Shiji Township in Panyu County can build 198 zhang of field foundation per person per hour, which is 47 times more efficient than building field foundations by hand in the past.

    Due to the benefits brought to farmers by new tools, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers to improve tools is very high, and moving stories continue to emerge. The peasant masses of Qin County, who were the first to realize vehicular transport, responded enthusiastically when the County Party Committee put forward the call to realize vehicular transport. Every household donated wood and lent tools, with craftsmen acting as teachers and thousands of farmers as apprentices, learning while doing. As a result, after four days and four nights of hard work, more than 69,000 wooden carts of various types were manufactured, realizing the requirement of one vehicle per household.

    The rural tool reform movement has not only received support and cooperation from relevant industrial departments, but has also promoted the development of local industries. The Guangdong Provincial Handicraft Cooperative decided to manufacture 250,000 ox carts, 750,000 handcarts, and 30,000 boats this year, and to reduce costs as much as possible to support the great leap forward in agriculture. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Transportation's Highway Bureau plans to build 35,000 kilometers of simple roads throughout the province in the next three years, as well as 150,000 kilometers of cart roads, and to connect these roads with the highway network. In order to eliminate old-fashioned plows, shoulder-pole transportation, and manual rice husking, and to realize the modernization of farm tools, the improvement of transportation tools, the semi-mechanization of agricultural and sideline product processing, and the scientific management of fertilizer, Yangjiang County decided to build 1,659 small factories in various townships throughout the county this year to manufacture and repair new farm tools and process various agricultural products.

### 人人动手赶造车辆　工业部门大力支援  广东农村消灭肩挑为期不远

    人人动手赶造车辆　工业部门大力支援
    广东农村消灭肩挑为期不远
    本报讯　一个以“消灭肩挑，实现运输车子化”为中心内容的农具改革运动，正在广东省农村中蓬勃展开。
    运动进展特别快的合浦专区，数十万农民正在紧张春耕的同时，奋勇苦战了八昼夜，到27日，除山高岭大的十万山自治县因道路不便制车较少外，全专区各县市都已实现车子化。现在，该区车子的数量已从20日前的八万多部激增至四十三万多部，已基本做到一户一车。在珠江三角洲地区和韶关专区，广大农民群众也掀起了一个工具大革命的热潮，纷纷找窍门，想办法改良和创造工具，有些县区成立了“农具改革委员会”或“工具改革委员会”，聘请各手工业社的熟练工人做顾问，广泛收集群众对改革工具的意见和要求，集中群众智慧，创造或改良农具，加以推广。番禺县则掀起一个“每人为千斤县立五功、献十计”的运动，并成立了评奖委员会，对改革工具有贡献的立即打锣打鼓祝贺，加以奖励。根据这种形势，全省要求在二年内消灭肩挑的计划肯定可以提前实现。
    广大农民的创造是多种多样，五色缤纷的。目前比较普遍推行的工具有“牛拉车”、“手推车”、“牛拉泥艇”、“空中钢铁运输线”等交通运输工具和“耙田机”、“活尺划行器”、“筑基光滑器”、“插秧船”等新式农具。这些工具的特点是制造简单，使用方便，效率较高，可以大大减轻农民的劳动强度，提高劳动效率。如新会县大泽一社用旧木料制成的平板车，一次可运肥二千斤，比肩挑快十倍以上。番禺县石基乡创造的“筑基光滑器”，每人每小时能筑成田基一百九十八丈，比过去用手筑田基效率提高四十七倍。
    由于新式工具给农民带来的好处，广大农民群众改良工具的热情非常高涨，动人事迹不断出现。最先实现车子化的钦县农民群众，当中共县委提出实现车子化的号召后，一致热烈响应，家家户户捐献木材，借出工具，由工匠当师傅，几千农民当徒弟，边做边学。结果，经过四日四夜的苦战，就制成了各种木车六万九千多架，实现了每户一车的要求。
    农村工具改革运动一方面得到了有关工业部门的支援和配合，同时，也促进了地方工业的发展。广东省手工业社决定今年制造牛车二十五万部，手推车七十五万部，船艇三万只，并尽量降低成本，以支援农业大跃进。广东省交通厅公路局在今后三年内，除计划在全省修筑三万五千公里简单公路外，还计划修筑大车路十五万公里，并使这些道路与公路线联结起来。阳江县为了今年做到消灭旧式犁、扁担运输和人力舂米，实现农具新式化、运输工具改良化、农副业产品加工半机械化、肥料处理科学化，决定今年在全县各乡兴建一千六百五十九个小型工厂，分别制造和修理新式农具，对各种农产品进行加工。
