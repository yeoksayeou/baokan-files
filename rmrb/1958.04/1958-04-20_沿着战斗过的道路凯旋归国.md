Xinhua News Agency, Zhou Changzong reporting:

    The train, fully loaded with People's Volunteer Army (PVA) troops from the heroic battleground of Shangganling, sped north. The officers and soldiers watched the peaks they had long defended, now tinged with lush green by the spring breeze, gradually receding into the distance. At this moment of triumphantly returning home along the roads they once fought on, all those towns, fields, and bridges on Korean soil stirred up a surge of emotions in their hearts.

    They couldn't forget the final night on Shangganling, when they guarded the positions together with their Korean People's Army comrades who were coming to relieve them. They couldn't forget the deep affection of the local people as they began to withdraw. They couldn't forget how the mountains, leveled by artillery fire by several meters, were once again covered with willow trees, peach trees, and azaleas. Several stations had been left behind, but the hearts of the officers and soldiers remained on Shangganling.

    The train entered Gaoshan Station, and the drivers of the motor vehicle units excitedly craned their necks out of the windows. During the war, Gaoshan Station was the terminus of the eastern railway line, and beyond that, all supplies relied on automobile transportation. The PVA's motor vehicle drivers, braving enemy bombing, strafing, and artillery blockades, continuously transported grain and ammunition to the front lines from this place. Second Lieutenant Guo Chongdi, a veteran driver, told stories of the past: Li Yongchen, a meritorious driver in their company, once transported timber for fortification construction for the frontline artillery and encountered American "oil tanker" planes on this road. The enemy planes dropped rows of small bombs at the truck, and Li Yongchen drove the truck desperately forward; the bombs couldn't catch up, couldn't stop it, so the enemy planes strafed head-on, and a bullet hit the truck, but Li Yongchen still drove desperately forward. If he had been even slightly less calm and stopped the truck, it would have been destroyed by the enemy planes. While speaking, Second Lieutenant Guo Chongdi looked at the motor vehicle road winding around Gaoshan, wanting to see the road he had driven on warily and calmly in those years.

    Looking at the fields rich in rice and apples through which the train passed, the soldiers of the engineering corps couldn't help but be moved by the memory of those comrades who shed their blood to protect the peaceful labor of the Korean people. After the ceasefire, while vigorously assisting the Korean people in their reconstruction efforts, the PVA's engineering corps also risked their lives to clear the mines, anti-tank mines, and time bombs planted by the enemy in the fields. In the Jincheng area east of Shangganling, three PVA sappers sacrificed their lives while clearing mines in the fields, and the Korean people built a monument for them. Liu Tang, a platoon leader of an engineering company, also gave his life while clearing a butterfly-type mine. When the train sped across the Daling River Bridge, the soldiers recalled the brave men who braved the severe cold of minus thirty degrees, chiseled through four feet of ice on the river surface, and laid the bridge foundation at the bottom of the river during the war.

    It was almost to Sinuiju, the city on the Korean border. People excitedly leaned out of the train windows to take a good look at the city's appearance. Many people had seen Sinuiju as a sea of red flames at night and a thick cloud of smoke during the day when they entered Korea; the entire city was in ruins. Now, welcoming the PVA troops was a sea of red flags like a blazing fire, a riot of colorful flowers, and replacing the ruins were neat streets and brand-new buildings. Dragon Xiliang, the bugler on the train, excitedly picked up his bugle and blew the sound of triumphant return. The people of Sinuiju, who had welcomed the PVA into Korea in 1950, came again today to warmly send off the PVA troops who had protected their peaceful labor, as they returned home.

    As the train sped towards the Yalu River, the officers and soldiers took off their hats and shouted repeatedly: "Goodbye, heroic Korea!" "Volunteer soldiers who guarded Shangganling will never forget you!"

    沿着战斗过的道路凯旋归国
    新华社记者　周长宗
    列车满载着来自英雄阵地上甘岭的志愿军部队向北疾驶。官兵们遥望着他们长期守卫过的已被春风抹上一片浓绿的峰峦渐渐远去。在这沿着当年战斗过的道路凯旋归国的时刻，所有那些朝鲜土地上的城镇、田野和桥梁，都使他们的心头激情汹涌。
    他们忘不了在上甘岭上和前来接防的朝鲜人民军战友共同守卫阵地的最后的夜晚，忘不了当地人民在他们开始撤离时的深情送别，忘不了那些被炮火削低了几公尺的山峰上又长遍了柳树、桃树和金达莱花。好几个车站撇在身后了，可是官兵们的心还留在上甘岭上。
    列车进入了高山车站，汽车部队的驾驶员们都激动地把头伸到窗口。在战争时期，高山车站是东线铁路的终点，再往前去，一切物资都靠汽车运输。志愿军的汽车驾驶员们，曾经冒着敌机的轰炸、扫射和炮火封锁，从这个地方源源地将粮食和弹药运往前线。老驾驶员郭崇弟少尉向人们讲起了当年的故事：早先在他们连里的功臣司机李永臣，有一次为前线炮兵运输构筑工事用的木料，在这条路上遇到了美国“油挑子”飞机。敌机将一排排的小型炸弹朝汽车丢来，李永臣驾驶着汽车拼命往前跑；炸弹追不上它，拦不住它，于是敌机又从前面迎头扫射，一颗子弹打到了汽车上，李永臣照样拼命往前跑。他如果稍一不沉着，将车停下，汽车非被敌机炸毁不可。郭崇弟少尉一边讲，一边望着盘旋在高山上的汽车路，他要看一看当年自己驾驶汽车警惕而沉着地走过的道路。
    工程兵部队的战士们望着列车经过的盛产大米和苹果的田野，不禁触动了对那些为保卫朝鲜人民和平劳动而流尽鲜血的战友的怀念。停战以后，志愿军的工程兵部队在大力帮助朝鲜人民从事恢复建设工作的同时，还冒着生命危险去清除敌人埋在田野里的地雷、反坦克雷和定时炸弹。在上甘岭以东的金城地带，有三个志愿军工兵战士在排除田里的地雷时牺牲了，朝鲜人民为他们修建了一座纪念碑。某工兵连队的排长刘堂，也在排除一个蝴蝶式的地雷时献出了自己的生命。当列车驰过大宁江桥的时候，战士们回忆起战时冒着零下三十度严寒，凿开四尺厚的江面冰层，将桥基打下江底的勇士们。
    快到朝鲜国境城市新义州了。人们兴奋地将头探出车外，要仔仔细细地看看这座城市的面貌。许多人在入朝时所看到的新义州，夜晚是一片红色的火光，白天是一片浓烈的烟雾，整个城市成了废墟。现在，迎接着志愿军部队的是一片火海一样的红旗，是一片五彩缤纷的花朵，代替废墟的是整洁的街道和崭新的楼房。列车上的号兵龙锡良兴奋地拿起军号吹起胜利凯旋的号声。那些曾经在1950年迎接志愿军入朝的新义州人民，今天又来热情欢送保卫他们和平劳动的志愿军部队归国。
    当列车驰向鸭绿江畔的时候，官兵们一齐脱下了帽子，连连高呼：“再见吧，英雄的朝鲜！”“守卫过上甘岭的志愿军战士们，永远不会忘怀你！”
