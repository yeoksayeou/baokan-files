Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: "Thoroughly break with bourgeois political and legal thought and eliminate old legal viewpoints." This is the battle cry recently put forward by people in Beijing's legal circles at a symposium on the great leap forward in legal research and political-legal teaching. They believe this is the primary prerequisite for establishing and developing a new socialist people's jurisprudence.

This symposium was convened in Beijing by the Legal Studies Group of the State Council's Scientific Planning Commission from March 29th to April 3rd. More than one hundred jurists, political and legal educators, and political and legal workers attending the symposium unanimously agreed that under the situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward, legal research and teaching work must and can completely leap forward. Legal workers must accelerate their pace and catch up.

In his speech, Wu Defeng pointed out that the "redness" and "expertise" of legal workers are unified and inseparable. Only by being "red" can one become "expert." He said that although there were many problems in legal research and teaching work in the past, such as dogmatism, objectivism, and revisionist ideological viewpoints, the fundamental problem, in essence, was still the influence of old legal viewpoints. Only by thoroughly destroying can something be built. Without completely breaking with old legal viewpoints, there can be no progress. Old law is a "poisonous bacterium" and can be used as a "preventive vaccine," but it must never be eaten as a "tonic." Socialist jurists should dare to set up new revolutions and establish differences from the old law. Wu Defeng said that a few people also need to study the old legal system, and the purpose is to "review the old and know the new," but they cannot escape reality by studying antiques; most people should use their main strength to study the practical experience of revolutionary struggles on the political and legal front since the founding of the country. Wu Defeng said that in order to leap forward, veteran jurists and young legal workers, schools and research units, and legal research, teaching units, and actual political and legal work departments should also implement socialist cooperation.

Zheng Shaowen said that when studying socialist legal science, ideology, systems, and articles, we must first see that they are fundamentally different from the bourgeois old law. For example, in the field of civil law, if we still study so-called "inheritance rights, creditor's rights," etc., according to private property relations, it is fundamentally not in line with the needs of China's socialist public ownership economic base. Legal workers must go deep into the masses to understand what the people support and oppose in order to study and summarize the practical experience of our country's political and legal work.

Zhou Xinmin talked about the preparations for the establishment of the Institute of Law of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the leap forward in legal research work in the future, hoping that people in the legal circles would cooperate. He said that based on his experience of engaging in the old law for thirty-one years before liberation, he deeply felt that the bourgeois old legal viewpoint is a stumbling block in socialist legal research work, and the task of establishing and developing socialist legal science can only be completed by thoroughly criticizing old legal thought.

Many jurists and representatives of teaching and research units put forward leap forward plans at the meeting. Xiao Yongqing of the Law Department of Peking University talked about his plan to leap toward the goal of becoming both "red" and "expert." Han Loli of the Law Department of Renmin University of China talked about his opinions on changing the curriculum system of the theory of state and law and carrying out curriculum reform. Professors Li Zuyin, Rui Mo, Zeng Bingyue, Wu Siyu, Yan Jingyao, Dai Keguang, and Gong Xiangrui also spoke at the meeting, expressing their determination to further carry out the struggle between the two roads in legal work. Li Haopei, a professor at the Foreign Affairs College, talked about breaking the "private ownership" of academics and overcoming the individualistic style of doing things alone.

### 同资产阶级旧法观点决裂  北京法学界决心大破大立红透专深

    同资产阶级旧法观点决裂
    北京法学界决心大破大立红透专深
    据新华社8日讯　“同资产阶级的政治法律思想彻底决裂，扫除旧法观点”，这是北京法学界人士最近在法学研究和政法教学工作跃进座谈会上提出的战斗口号，他们认为这是建立和发展社会主义的人民的新法学的首要前提。
    这次座谈会是由国务院科学规划委员会法学专业组从3月29日到4月3日在北京召集的。出席座谈会的一百多名法学家、政法教育工作者和政法工作者一致认为，在全民大跃进的形势下，法学研究和教学工作必须跃进，也完全能够跃进。法学工作者必须快马加鞭，迎头赶上。
    吴德峰在发言中指出，法学工作者的红与专是统一而不可分的。只有红透才能专深。他说，过去法学研究和教学工作中，虽然存在许多问题，如教条主义、客观主义和修正主义等思想观点，但从实质来看，根本问题仍然是旧法观点的影响。只有大破才能大立。不彻底同旧法观点决裂，就不能前进。旧法是“毒菌”，可以把它当作“防疫的疫苗”，但绝不能当作“补品”来吃。社会主义的法学家应当勇于标革命之新，立旧法之异。吴德峰说，旧的法制也需要有少数人来研究，其目的是“温故知新”，但不能在研究古董中逃避现实；大多数人应当用主要力量研究建国以来政法战线上革命斗争的实践经验。吴德峰说，为了跃进，老法学家和青年法学工作者，学校和研究单位，法学研究、教学单位和政法实际工作部门还应当实行社会主义大协作。
    郑绍文说，在研究社会主义的法律科学、思想、制度、条文时，必须首先看到它们同资产阶级的旧法有着根本不同。例如在民法方面，如果今天还是按照私有财产关系来研究所谓“继承权、债权”等等，那就根本不符合我国社会主义公有制经济基础的需要。法学工作者必须深入群众，了解人民拥护什么、反对什么，来研究和总结我国政法工作的实践经验。
    周新民在会上谈到中国科学院法学研究所的筹备工作情况和今后法学研究工作的跃进，希望法学界人士进行合作。他表示，根据他在解放前搞过三十一年旧法的经历，深深感到资产阶级旧法观点是社会主义法学研究工作的绊脚石，必须彻底批判旧法思想才能完成建立和发展社会主义法律科学的任务。
    许多法学家、教学研究单位的代表在会上提出了跃进规划。北京大学法律系萧永清谈了自己向红透专深的目标跃进的计划。中国人民大学法律系韩络立谈到对改变国家和法的理论的课程体系、进行课程改革的意见。李祖荫、芮沫、曾炳约、吴思裕、严景耀、戴克光、龚祥瑞等教授都在会上发言，表示决心在法学工作中进一步开展两条道路的斗争。外交学院李浩培教授谈到要打破学术上的“私有制”，克服个人主义的单干作风。
