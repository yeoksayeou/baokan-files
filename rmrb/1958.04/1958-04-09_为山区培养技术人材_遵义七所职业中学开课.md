Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang – To cultivate technical talent for mountainous regions, Zunyi County in Guizhou Province has established ten junior vocational schools. Seven of these schools started classes on the 1st, and the rest will open successively in early April.

These vocational schools cover agriculture, industry, forestry, sericulture, flue-cured tobacco, green ramie, animal husbandry, and veterinary medicine. They were all established by the masses without spending a single cent of state funds. The guiding principle of these schools is to focus on technical demonstration and talent cultivation. Students both work and study. Each school is built on farms, forest farms, livestock farms, and sericulture experimental stations according to the different specialties offered. Teachers are technical personnel from these units. The students are primarily young commune members with a senior elementary school education, recommended by the agricultural cooperatives. The duration of study varies from three years to two years or one year. Upon graduation, students are expected to reach the cultural level of junior high school graduates and the technical level of junior technicians.

    为山区培养技术人材
    遵义七所职业中学开课
    据新华社贵阳讯　贵州省遵义县为给山区培养技术人才筹建的十所初级职业学校，已有七所在1日开学上课，其余的都将在本月上旬陆续开学。
    这些职业学校包括农业、工业、林业、蚕桑、烤烟、青麻、畜牧和兽医等，全部都由群众兴办，未花国家一文钱。这些学校的办校方针是以技术示范、培养人才为主；学生都是一边劳动一边读书。各校根据不同专业分别建立在农场、林场、畜牧场和蚕桑试验站内，教师都由这些单位的技术人员来担任。各学校的学生来源，绝大部分是农业社保送具有高小毕业程度的青年社员。学习时间有的是三年，有的是两年或一年。学生毕业时，在文化上要达到初中毕业生的水平；在技术上要达到初级技术员的水平。
