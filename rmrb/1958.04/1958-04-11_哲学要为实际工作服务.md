    Philosophy Must Serve Practical Work
    Ai Siqi
    The first condition for a leap forward in philosophical research is that everyone should be full of enthusiasm, just like the vast number of workers and peasants across the country. However, enthusiasm alone is not enough; we must also have the correct direction of effort. If the direction is wrong, we may not only fail to leap forward, but may even regress. Comrade Chen Boda's speech on "emphasizing the present over the past, learning while doing" pointed out a general direction of effort for philosophical and social science workers across the country, and we must seriously study it. Here, I would like to offer some opinions solely on the direction of effort in philosophical research.
    The declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries held last year in Moscow pointed out that "one of the urgent tasks of Communist and Workers' Parties is to apply dialectical materialism in practical work and to educate cadres and the broad masses with Marxism-Leninism." Although this speaks of the task of Communist and Workers' Parties, I think it should also be the most fundamental task of us philosophy workers. We people engaged in philosophical research, no matter which department our specific division of labor is in, whether we are studying dialectical materialism itself or studying the history of philosophy, logic, etc., should regard the solution of this "urgent problem" of "applying dialectical materialism in practical work" as the ultimate goal of all our research work, and take this goal as the beacon for our leap forward. Philosophical research should "emphasize the present over the past." In the aspect of "emphasizing the present," we should especially "emphasize" the "present" of current practical work in all aspects of society, and "emphasize" the "present" of socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    Marx, in "A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right," mentioned that philosophy should be the spiritual weapon of the proletariat, and mentioned the issue of theory grasping the masses. Marx and Engels created dialectical materialism not for any other purpose, but solely for the correct solution of various practical problems in the proletarian revolutionary struggle. The declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries pointed out: "If a Marxist party does not observe problems from the viewpoint of dialectics and materialism, it will generate one-sidedness and subjectivism, it will make thinking rigid and divorced from reality, it will be unable to make appropriate analyses of things, and it will commit the errors of revisionism or dogmatism." This is a summary of more than 100 years of proletarian revolutionary struggle experience since Marx and Engels. The proletariat and its party need to apply dialectical materialism in their practical work; the broad masses who are leaping forward vigorously and continuously in the socialist revolution and the technological revolution need to apply dialectical materialism in their practical struggles. If people engaged in philosophical research cannot help the proletariat and its party meet this urgent need, and cannot help the broad masses meet this urgent need, then they will be seriously derelict in their duties, because they have separated their research from practical work, making their research a completely meaningless activity. From the point of view of the current Two-Anti movement being carried out in our country, this is the greatest waste, including the waste of people in spirit and the waste of the publishing industry in material terms.
    Only by constantly directing philosophical research towards the needs of practical work can such research have true life and make dialectical materialism receive vivid explanation and development. The development of dialectical materialism itself has always been obtained in the process of its practical application. Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" pushed Marxist philosophy to a new stage because this work solved the then urgent practical problem of opposing revisionism (whose philosophical foundation was subjective idealism) in the Russian proletarian revolutionary struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," applied materialist dialectics to analyze and summarize the experiences of decades of proletarian socialist revolution and socialist construction, and correctly solved a series of extremely complex practical problems arising from contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, which in the philosophical aspect enabled Marxist materialist dialectics, especially its core – the law of the unity of opposites, to receive new development.
    What should be especially mentioned is that in our China, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, many such people have emerged among the cadres engaged in practical work in various places. They not only have a lot of practical work experience, but are also able to apply dialectical materialism well to their work. Therefore, they are able to create outstanding achievements in their work together with the broad masses of workers and peasants. The current situation of surging enthusiasm and rapid progress in China's industry, agriculture and all aspects of work not only demonstrates the correctness of the central leadership, but also shows that we already have many cadres who are able to master correct working methods and ways of thinking in their work. We only need to carefully study some of the summaries of local work that have already been published in the newspapers, such as the Hubei Provincial Committee's report on Guanghua County and Jun County's water conservancy construction, the Hubei Provincial Committee's report on cadres at all levels planting experimental fields, and Tianjin Prefectural Committee Secretary Zhao Ke's report on transforming low-lying land, etc., and it is not difficult to see that these reports are vivid examples of the combination of the principles of dialectical materialism and practical work. We can see that there are many philosophical "laymen" here whose ability to master Marxist philosophy in practical work is far stronger than that of those "experts" and "insiders" who have long been doing research work only in their studies. Right-wing elements once clamored that "laymen cannot lead insiders," but the fact is that there are many "laymen" who, in some respects, are far ahead of our so-called "insiders."
    This situation shows that we people who specialize in philosophical research must make the greatest effort to leap forward in order to be able to shoulder our work tasks. The general task of philosophical researchers should be to help cadres in practical work better apply dialectical materialism, and to propagate the Marxist worldview among the broad masses of the people. However, at present, many of us engaged in the research and teaching of Marxist philosophy must first learn from those cadres in practical work, and learn from the vigorous struggles of the broad masses of the people, before we can make truly beneficial contributions to the above-mentioned tasks.
    Should those who study the history of philosophy also pay attention to the issue of applying dialectical materialism in practical work? The answer is definitely yes. The purpose of studying the history of philosophy is not to make our thoughts sink into the past, but only to draw certain experiences and lessons from the past philosophical ideological struggles, from the long historical struggle between materialism and idealism in the past, in order to help us better master dialectical materialism today and be better at fighting idealism. We must not let the past hold back the present, but should let the past serve the present. Therefore, those who study the history of philosophy should also pay attention to and study the issue of applying dialectical materialism in practical work. Moreover, only by constantly paying attention to and studying this issue of the "present" can we easily obtain a correct understanding of many issues of the "past" in the history of philosophy. For example, some of our philosophers refuse to admit that the history of philosophy is the history of the struggle between two major opposing parties, materialism and idealism. They insist that the relationship between materialism and idealism is that of brothers, friends, and teachers and students. If they seriously study how fierce the struggle between materialism and idealism in thought and style has been in the recent decades of revolutionary practical struggle in China, then that set of views would be completely untenable. In practical work, idealism – subjectivism – has caused very great losses in our revolutionary history. In order to overcome subjectivism and apply the materialist viewpoint to the practical work of the revolution, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have paid the price of many lives. Therefore, idealism – subjectivism – "is the great enemy of the Communist Party, the great enemy of the working class, the great enemy of the people, and the great enemy of the nation," this is Comrade Mao Zedong's conclusion. Comrade Chen Boda once quoted Marx's words: "Human anatomy is a key to ape anatomy. The hints of higher animals in lower animals can only be understood after higher animals are already known." To correctly understand the experience of struggle in the past history of philosophy, it is necessary to seriously study today's philosophical ideological struggle, especially the struggle between materialism and idealism, and the struggle between dialectics and metaphysics in practical work.
    Regarding the issue of logical research, I believe that logical research must also pay attention to the connection with practical work. Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" discussed the process of the formation of concepts, judgments, and inferences in people's practical activities. At present, there is a tendency in logical research to leave the practical process and specialize in the study of pure logical forms. This is a bourgeois idealist line that must be overcome. The Chinese people need our logicians to be able to help solve such problems: how to make clear concepts, judgments, and inferences about the problems raised in our practical work. I believe that solving such problems is the key to a leap forward in logical research.
    Based on the above reasons, it can be affirmed that we people engaged in philosophical research should, without exception, regard the solution of the problem of "applying dialectical materialism in practical work" as the general direction of our efforts. In order to be able to leap forward along this correct direction, what issues must we pay attention to?
    First, as mentioned earlier, we must learn from cadres engaged in practical work and learn from the struggles of the broad masses of the people. In this regard, many important reports and news in the daily newspapers provide us with rich indirect learning materials, which are worthy of our constant and serious study. In addition to this, we should also strive to establish contact with comrades engaged in practical work and directly obtain help from them. Only by first learning from comrades engaged in practical work can we then theoretically process what we have learned, put forward some beneficial opinions in philosophy, and in turn give help to comrades in practical work.
    To learn to swim, one must go into the water. Philosophical researchers should strive to arrange a certain amount of time in their own planning to directly contact reality, and conduct specific research on the problems raised therein. Only in this way can they truly develop the ability to apply dialectical materialism in practical work.
    What should be especially mentioned is that we must seriously study the Party's policies in all aspects and seriously study Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Have our philosophical researchers paid enough attention to learning in this area? It definitely cannot be said that it is already enough. Moreover, there is even a serious situation of neglecting learning in this area among some people. The Party's policies and Comrade Mao Zedong's works are the embodiment of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, and are outstanding examples of the application of dialectical materialism in all aspects of practical work in China. Philosophical researchers have the responsibility to study and research them deeply and to propagate them among the masses of the people. The situation of neglecting this task is intolerable.

    哲学要为实际工作服务
    艾思奇
    哲学研究工作跃进的第一个条件是大家要鼓足干劲，像全国广大工人农民一样。但是，仅仅有干劲是不够的，我们还要有正确的努力方向。如果方向错了，不但不能跃进，反而可能倒退。陈伯达同志关于“厚今薄古、边干边学”的讲话，给全国哲学社会科学工作者指出了一个总的努力方向，我们必须认真地加以研究。这里，我想单就哲学研究工作的努力方向问题谈一点意见。
    去年在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言里曾指出，“在实际工作中运用辩证唯物论，用马克思列宁主义教育干部和广大群众，是共产党和工人党的迫切任务之一。”这里讲的虽然是共产党和工人党的任务，但是我想这也应该是我们哲学工作者的最根本的任务。我们从事哲学研究工作的人，无论他们的具体分工是在哪一部门，无论他们是研究辩证唯物论本身还是研究哲学史、逻辑学等等，都应该把“在实际工作中运用辩证唯物论”这个“迫切问题”的解决当作自己一切研究工作的终极目标，把这个目标作为我们向前跃进的灯塔。哲学研究工作要“厚今薄古”。在“厚今”方面，就是特别要“厚”当前社会各方面的实际工作这个“今”，“厚”社会主义革命和社会主义建设这个“今”。
    马克思在“黑格尔法律哲学批判序言”里，曾提到哲学应该是无产阶级的精神武器，提到理论掌握群众的问题。马克思恩格斯创立辩证唯物论哲学不是为着任何其他目的，而只是为着正确解决无产阶级革命斗争中各种实际问题。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言指出：“一个马克思主义的政党如果不用辩证法和唯物论的观点去观察问题，就会产生片面性和主观主义，就会使思想僵化和脱离实际，不善于对事物作恰当的分析，就会犯修正主义或者教条主义的错误”。这是马克思恩格斯以来一百多年无产阶级革命斗争经验的总结。无产阶级和它的党，需要在自己的实际工作中应用辩证唯物论；在社会主义革命和技术革命过程中轰轰烈烈地不断地向前跃进着的广大人民，需要在自己的实际斗争中应用辩证唯物论。从事哲学研究工作的人，如果不能帮助无产阶级和它的党满足这个迫切需要、不能帮助广大人民满足这个迫切需要，那末他们就会严重地失职，因为他们使自己的研究脱离了实际工作，使自己的研究成为完全没有意义的活动。从目前我国正在进行的双反运动的观点来说，这就是最大的浪费，包括人在精神上的浪费和出版界在物质上的浪费。
    只有把哲学研究经常指向实际工作的需要这一目标，这样的研究工作才有真正的生命，才能使辩证唯物论哲学得到生动的解释和发挥。辩证唯物论哲学本身的发展，从来都是在它的实际应用过程中获得的。列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”把马克思主义哲学推到一个新阶段，就因为这部著作解决了俄国无产阶级革命斗争中反对修正主义（它的哲学基础是主观唯心主义）这一个当时迫切的实际问题。毛泽东同志的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”，应用唯物辩证法来分析和总结几十年来无产阶级社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验，正确解决了由于人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾所产生的一系列极其复杂的实际问题，这就在哲学方面使马克思主义的唯物辩证法特别是它的核心——对立统一规律得到了新的发挥。
    特别应该提到的是，在我们中国，共产党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导之下，各地从事实际工作的干部中，已出现了很多这样的人，他们不但有很多实际工作经验，而且也能够很好地应用辩证唯物论到自己的工作中去，因此他们就能够和广大工农群众一起，共同在工作中创造出卓越的成绩来。目前中国工农业以及各方面工作所表现的万马奔腾、突飞猛进的飞跃形势，不但说明中央领导的正确，也说明我们已经有很多干部能够在工作中掌握正确的工作方法和思想方法。我们只要仔细研究一下报纸上已发表过的一些地方工作的总结，如湖北省委会关于光化县和均县兴修水利的报告，湖北省委关于各级干部种试验田的报告，天津地委书记赵克同志关于改造洼地的报告，等等，就不难看出，这些报告正是辩证唯物论哲学原理和实际工作互相结合的生动范例。我们可以看到，这里有许多哲学的“外行”，他们在实际工作中掌握马克思主义哲学的能力，比起那长期地只是在书房里做研究工作的“专家”、“内行”来，不知要强过多少倍。右派分子曾经发出过“外行不能领导内行”的叫嚣，事实是，有许多“外行”，在某些方面是远远地走在我们所谓“内行”前面了。
    这样的情形说明，我们专门从事哲学研究工作的人必须尽最大的努力向前跃进，才能担负起自己的工作任务。哲学研究工作者的总的任务，应该是帮助实际工作中的干部更好地应用辩证唯物论，是在广大人民中宣传马克思主义的世界观。但是，在目前，我们许多从事马克思主义哲学的研究和教学工作的人们，首先还要向那些在实际工作中的干部学习，要在广大人民的轰轰烈烈的斗争中去学习，然后才有可能对上述的任务作出真正有益的贡献。
    研究哲学史的人是否也应该注意在实际工作中应用辩证唯物论的问题呢？答复是完全肯定的。研究哲学史的目的，并不是要使我们的思想沉没在过去的时代，而只是为着要从过去的哲学思想斗争中、从过去唯物论和唯心论的长期的历史斗争中吸取某些经验教训，以便帮助我们在今天更好地掌握辩证唯物论和更善于和唯心论进行斗争。不能让过去拖住现在，而应该让过去为现在服务。因此，研究哲学史的人，也仍然要注意和研究在实际工作中应用辩证唯物论的问题。并且，也只有经常注意和研究这个“今”的问题，对于哲学史的许多“古”的问题才容易获得正确的理解。举例来说，我们有些哲学家不肯承认哲学史是唯物论和唯心论两大敌对党派斗争的历史，他们硬要说唯物论和唯心论的关系是兄弟、朋友和师生的关系。如果他们认真研究一下中国最近几十年来革命的实际斗争中间唯物论和唯心论的思想方法和思想作风曾进行过如何激烈的斗争，那末他们那一套观点就根本拿不出来了。在实际工作中的唯心论——主观主义，曾经在我们革命的历史上造成非常大的损失。为了克服主观主义，把唯物论的观点应用到革命的实际工作中，中国共产党和中国人民是曾经付出了很多人的生命作为代价的。所以，唯心论——主观主义“是共产党的大敌，是工人阶级的大敌，是人民的大敌，是民族的大敌”，这是毛泽东同志的结论。陈伯达同志曾引用了马克思的这段话：“人体解剖对于猴体解剖是一把钥匙，在下等动物身上所透露的高等动物的征象，反而只有在已经认识了高等动物之后才能理解。”要正确地理解过去哲学史上的斗争经验，就必须认真研究今天的哲学思想斗争，特别是研究实际工作中唯物主义和唯心主义的斗争，辩证法和形而上学的斗争。
    关于逻辑研究工作的问题，我以为，逻辑的研究也必须注意到和实际工作的联系。毛泽东同志的“实践论”曾论到概念、判断和推理在人们的实践过程中形成的过程。目前，逻辑的研究工作中有一种离开实践过程专门研究纯粹的逻辑形式的倾向，这是必须克服的资产阶级唯心主义路线。中国人民需要我们的逻辑学家能够帮助解决这样的问题：如何对我们的实际工作中所提出的问题作出明确的概念、判断和推理等。我认为，解决这样的问题，是逻辑研究工作跃进的关键。
    根据以上的理由，可以肯定，我们从事哲学研究工作的人，应该毫无例外地把“在实际工作中应用辩证唯物论”这个问题的解决，当做我们努力的总的方向。为要能够沿着这个正确的方向向前跃进，我们必须注意哪些问题呢？
    首先是，正如前面已经说过的，要向从事实际工作的干部学习，要在广大人民群众的斗争中学习。在这一方面，每天报纸上的许多重要的报告和新闻，给我们提供了丰富的间接的学习材料，值得我们经常地认真研究。除此而外，我们还应该争取和从事实际工作的同志们建立联系，直接从他们中间取得帮助。只有首先向从事实际工作的同志们学习，然后才有可能对于所学到的东西进行理论上的加工，在哲学上提出某些有益的意见，反过来对实际工作中的同志们给与帮助。
    要学游泳必须下水。哲学研究工作者应该在自己规划中，争取安排一定的时间去直接接触实际，并且对其中所提出的问题进行具体的研究，这样才能真正锻炼在实际工作中应用辩证唯物论的本领。
    特别应该提到的是，要认真地研究党的各方面的政策，认真地研究毛泽东同志的著作。我们的哲学研究工作者在这一方面的学习是不是注意得很够了呢？决不能说是已经很够了。并且，在有些人中间甚至有忽视这方面的学习的严重情形。党的政策和毛泽东同志的著作是马克思主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相互结合的体现，是辩证唯物论在中国各方面实际工作中应用的卓越范例，哲学研究工作者有责任加以深刻的学习研究，并在人民群众中进行宣传。忽视这个任务的情形是不能容忍的。
