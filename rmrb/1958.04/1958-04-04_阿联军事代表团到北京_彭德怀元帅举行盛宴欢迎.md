Shabini, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Arab Union Embassy in China, also went to welcome them.

Minister Peng Dehuai accompanied Head of Delegation Muhammad Ibrahim in reviewing the guard of honor. Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of National Defense, introduced the distinguished guests to the senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and military attachés of various countries stationed in China who came to welcome them. Subsequently, Minister Peng Dehuai delivered a welcoming speech, expressing the warmest welcome on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to Head of Delegation Muhammad Ibrahim and all members of the delegation, and wishing the delegation a complete success in their visit.

Minister Peng Dehuai said that both China and the Arab Union are countries with long histories and ancient cultures. Our traditional friendly exchanges can be traced back to thousands of years ago. In recent years, in the struggle against our common enemy—imperialism—this traditional friendship has been further developed. This visit to China by the Military Goodwill Delegation headed by General Ibrahim will undoubtedly make a great contribution to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the armies of China and the Arab Union.

Head of Delegation Muhammad Ibrahim then delivered a speech, first expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the grand welcome the delegation received. He said, "I am very happy to be here to convey the best wishes of our armed forces to your armed forces."

Head of Delegation Muhammad Ibrahim said: "I believe we will spend a happy time in China, and we will meet many good friends. I believe this visit will enhance the friendly relations between our two ancient republics." Finally, accompanied by Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong and others, the delegation took cars to their residence to rest.

Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd: Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai held a banquet in Beijing tonight to welcome the Arab Union Military Goodwill Delegation headed by Lieutenant General Muhammad Ibrahim.

Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, attended tonight's banquet.

Minister Peng Dehuai and Head of Delegation Muhammad Ibrahim spoke at the banquet successively.

In his speech, Minister Peng Dehuai expressed a warm welcome and sincere respect to the distinguished guests on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said: "Your armed forces have made immortal contributions in the heroic battles to defend your motherland and oppose aggression. In your glorious days of battle, the Chinese people and army have always been concerned about your struggle and regarded your victory as the victory of peace-loving people, as our own victory."

Minister Peng Dehuai said: "The Chinese people and army have always been your reliable friends. Because both of our countries have not only been subjected to imperialist aggression in the past, but also continue to be subjected to imperialist hostility. Our mutual sympathy and support are very natural."

Minister Peng Dehuai concluded: "We sincerely hope that during your visit in our country, you can, like brothers, criticize our shortcomings in all aspects, and we are also willing to learn from your valuable experience."

In his speech, Head of Delegation Muhammad Ibrahim said: "Every citizen of our country, whether in the army or among the common people, cherishes feelings of friendship and love for your friendly country and noble people. You have expressed your deep friendship and supported our cause in various periods and situations. This is not surprising for you, because your ancient and modern history have proved in various conclusive ways that you love peace. You have never launched a war of aggression against anyone, and all your wars have been to defend the security of your territory, to oppose brutal aggressors and occupying imperialists."

Head of Delegation Muhammad Ibrahim said that we have the same goals and the same aspirations, that is, to eliminate all kinds of attempts, ambitions, and tricks of the imperialists, to defend our territory from aggression, and to safeguard world peace.

Head of Delegation Muhammad Ibrahim concluded that our visit will become a factor in strengthening the friendship and love between the peoples of our two countries, and at the same time enhance our confidence in maintaining world peace.
