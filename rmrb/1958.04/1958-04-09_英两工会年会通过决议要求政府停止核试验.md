Xinhua News Agency, London, 8th.—The annual meeting of the British Shop Assistants and Delivery Workers' Union, held in Margate, passed a resolution on April 6 demanding that the British government immediately cease nuclear weapons testing and convene an East-West summit to ease international tensions. It also demanded a stop to atomic bomb-carrying bombers flying over Britain and the establishment of rocket bases in Britain.

    The meeting also passed a resolution condemning the British government's domestic policies which "are causing unemployment to become increasingly serious and industrial production to stagnate."

    The union's chairman, Member of Parliament Padley, accused the government at the meeting of attempting to lower workers' wages and increase factory owners' incomes, and of "consciously using the increase in the number of unemployed and the reduction in production as a solution to Britain's economic problems."

    The annual meeting of the British Draughtsmen's Union of Machine Manufacturing and Shipbuilding Industries, held in Paxton (Derbyshire) on the 7th, also passed a resolution criticizing the government's decision to establish American rocket bases in Britain, saying that it put the country in danger.

    The resolution said: What we need is not an expansion of the nuclear base network in Europe, but a summit meeting on the establishment of military and nuclear weapon buffer zones.

    英两工会年会通过决议要求政府停止核试验
    新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：在马尔加特举行的英国店员与送货工人工会年会会议4月6日通过了一项决议，要求英国政府立刻停止核武器试验和召开东西方最高级会议来缓和国际紧张局势，并且要求制止载有原子弹的轰炸机在英国上空飞行和在英国建立火箭基地。
    会议还通过了一项决议，谴责英国政府的内政政策“使得失业现象日趋严重和工业生产停滞”。
    这个工会的主席、议员派德莱在会上指责政府企图降低工人的工资而增加厂主的收入，并且“有意识地利用失业人数的增加和生产的缩减作为解决英国经济问题的办法”。
    在培克斯顿（德尔比郡）举行的英国机器制造和造船业绘图员工会年会会议7日也通过了一项决议，指责政府打算在英国建立美国火箭基地的决定使国家处在危险中。
    决议说：我们需要的不是在欧洲扩大核基地网，而是就建立军事的和核武器的缓冲地区举行最高级会谈。
