    Mountain Village Letters
    Lin Danqiu

    In the new society, people know how to race against time, and time also knows how to race against people. More than twenty days have flown by since I arrived in Sanmen. I remember your enthusiastic instructions, and it's time for me to report on the situation here.

    Sanmen is a "mountain county" in eastern Zhejiang, and it was once my familiar hometown. However, after a long absence, I feel a sense of unfamiliarity. In the early spring of 1950, shortly after the liberation of Sanmen, I returned here and stayed for a few days. What I saw and heard then was exciting enough, but compared to today's situation, I am dumbfounded. In the long river of history, eight years is a short time, but such great changes have taken place in this "mountain county"! Look, the well-connected roads are new, the dazzling electric lights in the county town are new, the broadcasting station, Xinhua Bookstore, Sanmen Theater, Workers' Club, and many other buildings are new. Even the familiar streets and shops in the urban area have been transformed beyond recognition. The changes in the county's natural landscape are even more significant. Need I even mention the changes in people's mental outlook? In the past, people who would blush to go up the mountain or down to the fields now consider it an honor. It is embarrassing not to work when one is able to. Primary school students collecting manure, middle school students reclaiming wasteland, and women plowing and transplanting rice seedlings have become the norm. Cadres who are absent from labor must ask for leave in advance. New people, new things, new atmosphere! Of course, there are also things that I am familiar with. The local accent is familiar, the old-fashioned farm tools are familiar, and the old methods of digging earth and transporting mud are familiar. Familiar yet unfamiliar – that is the hometown in the midst of the Great Leap Forward.

    In mountainous areas and coastal regions, the most striking sights are the large and small newly built reservoirs and the newly transformed paddy fields. The county's three hundred or so reservoirs guarantee the irrigation of over 100,000 mu of paddy fields for forty to fifty days during droughts, and the transformation of over 30,000 mu of paddy fields will greatly increase production. As for the changes in farming systems and the afforestation situation in various districts, there is no end to what I could say.

    Do you understand the practical significance of these changes? You should know something about the past. Before liberation, Sanmen was characterized by three "mores": more mountains, more paddy fields, and more bandits. After a few days of rain, mountain floods would pour down, creating a vast expanse of water. Sometimes, combined with surging tides, the floodwaters would impact the embankments, causing them to collapse under the combined assault of internal and external waters. A clamor of voices and deafening drumbeats could not stop the atrocities of nature. Boundless rice fields would yield no harvest. Even families with land often became impoverished overnight, known as "night poverty," not to mention the original impoverished households. What would happen if it didn't rain? That was also not a good sign. Under the scorching sun, with no water source, the rice fields gasped for breath, and the crops withered. The residents would cry out to heaven. To compete for water, even brothers would fight each other until their heads were broken, and sometimes water disputes would escalate into large-scale clashes between villages, halting all production work. Because of the fear of drought, no one dared to drain the water from the paddy fields, and the waterlogged fields could not be used to grow green manure (grass seeds). Moreover, the transplanting of rice seedlings required particularly long seedlings, making it impossible to plant and harvest early, so only single-season rice could be grown. Furthermore, due to the threat of floods, no one was willing to cultivate intensively or apply fertilizer reasonably, fearing that all their efforts would be in vain. Everyone held the belief of "relying on heaven for food": "If there is a harvest, we'll get a few dou; if there is no harvest, let the chickens peck around." Therefore, even without floods or droughts, the yield of paddy fields was pitifully low: generally two to three hundred jin per mu, and at worst, only a few dozen jin. With the "three mores" unchanged, the "three disasters" were endless, coupled with exorbitant taxes and levies, and heavy exploitation. Can you imagine the lives of the working people? Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of Sanmen have continuously improved their fate, production has increased year by year, and bandits have disappeared. This has surpassed even the so-called "no one picks up lost items, doors are not closed at night" prosperity of the past. However, before the Great Leap Forward movement, the passive situation of "relying on heaven for food" had not been fundamentally reversed.

    The profound changes brought about by the Great Leap Forward movement in the natural landscape foreshadow this year's bumper harvest. With so many reservoirs, things are much easier. Rainwater can be stored during rainy days and used for irrigation during droughts. With preparations made, who wouldn't be willing to dig ditches and canals under the command of the Party, drain the water from the paddy fields, and transform them into double-cropping, high-yield fields? This year's production target has been raised repeatedly, and finally set at an average of 800 jin per mu. This is something that no one dared to dream of in the past. This year, we will also build water conservancy projects on a large scale, and the great plan for the county's water conservancy will soon be realized.

    Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture, especially in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas like Sanmen, which are surrounded by mountains and close to the sea. However, besides water conservancy, fertilizer is the biggest guarantee for this year's bumper harvest. After two weeks of a concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign, the average amount of fertilizer per mu has reached over 500 dan. This is a miracle comparable to the three hundred or so reservoir projects.

    Whether it is building reservoirs or accumulating fertilizer, the bustling collective labor will make you so excited that you can't speak. During the day, there is a surging tide of people, and at night there are patches of light: the gas lamps are white, and the lanterns and "firewood lamps" are all red. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, countless families close their doors and go to work. Countless heroic figures, endless model deeds, and endless lists of honors! More than 100,000 glorious sons and daughters are transforming the barren mountainous area with such pioneering spirit and overwhelming labor, writing the history of socialism.

    I must especially mention the Great Leap Forward of the women of Sanmen. They shattered the shackles of conservative thought at once, broke the conventions that women should not go to the fields, and solved the contradictions between housework and production by all means: some carried their children to the construction site, some led their children to the fields, some lit a fire in front of the stove, and then went outside the gate to do some fertilizer accumulation work. Four hundred female heroes in the Six Ao District, under the leadership of the women's "steel team," worked hard for ninety days and nights and completed the "Women's Reservoir," which is 260 meters long and 19 meters wide, attracting groups of women from other places to visit, greatly inspiring the Great Leap Forward spirit of women throughout the county. With the arrival of the spring plowing and rice transplanting season, the labor force became even more strained. They consciously shouldered urgent tasks, overcame the difficulties unique to women, and learned how to plow and transplant rice seedlings. In the vast fields, you can see women everywhere.

    Why do the sons and daughters of the "mountain county" have such great revolutionary enthusiasm? After conducting ten days of in-depth and meticulous inspection here, the Taizhou branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee Agricultural Production Inspection Team linked the outstanding enthusiasm of the Sanmen masses with the leadership style and leadership methods of the Party committees at all levels in the county, praising them as the "Three Treasures." This is a well-deserved evaluation for Sanmen.

    What are the characteristics of the leadership style here? It is to first inspire, educate, and move the masses with the spirit of taking the lead in practical work and then to lead the masses. At critical moments, they always take the lead in overcoming difficulties, wearing straw raincoats and bamboo hats, digging earth and carrying mud, becoming members of the ordinary working people. When transforming the paddy fields in Aokou Township, the weather was cold and the wind howled. Comrade Du Jie, Secretary of the County Party Committee, said "Let's do it!" and took off his coat, leaving only a small cotton jacket, and started working, and the masses immediately followed. Comrade Yan Rujin, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, who came from a hired worker background, always worked with cadres and the masses for a while before explaining the reasons when he went to districts, townships, and communes. After seeing his practical spirit, the cadres and the masses were more convinced by his reasoning. This leadership style and the conscious actions of the masses influenced and promoted each other, like adding fuel to the fire, and the enthusiasm of both sides became increasingly vigorous.

    Anyone and any work is inevitably flawed and has mistakes. The problem lies in the attitude towards shortcomings and mistakes. The Yanjiang District made some achievements, and the cadres and the masses became arrogant and complacent. The County Party Secretary wore straw sandals and crossed the mountains and ridges in the heavy snow to convene a meeting of district and township party member cadres there. The District Party Secretary and the branch secretaries of various townships were moved by this news. The District Secretary, because he himself slipped and fell on the ground while fetching water at home, determined that the County Party Secretary must have fallen and injured himself on the road, so he personally brought a doctor and a medicine bag to meet him on the road. At that meeting, the County Party Secretary first affirmed the achievements of the district, and then introduced the better work experience of other districts, explaining the principle that "arrogance makes people fall behind." The district and township cadres were convinced, and their ideological style changed. The whole district did not stop working even when it was raining or snowing.

    Here is another relatively prominent good experience, which is the experience of broadcasting meetings. In the past, the meeting burden of district and township cadres was very heavy. Attending meetings in the county would take five or ten days, confusing their minds, and they would bring back a lot of tasks that had to be passed down level by level. But today, the County Party Committee tries its best to use radio, a modern tool, to directly introduce typical experiences to cadres and the masses in various districts, to assign tasks, and to focus on one point at a time, neatly and efficiently, saying what to say, doing what to do. This saves time and strengthens practical results. When encountering urgent tasks, the role of broadcasting meetings is even greater.

    These days, the weather is sunny and warm, and the fields are covered with deep green wheat waves and light green rice seedlings. The production situation is very good. However, the comrades of the County Party Committee are right, we must not be careless in leading production, we must grasp every level and pay attention to every step. According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee's agricultural production inspection team, the County Party Committee is studying and discussing how to add ingenuity to the enthusiasm of the masses, how to pay attention to the rhythm of work, how to regularize the fertilizer accumulation work, how to prevent rice seedling rot, and how to launch a high tide of technical innovation. The lights in the office building are on late into the night. As usual, after studying here for a few days, they will go down to work separately again.

    It's late at night and I'm tired, and I must end my letter. But listen, isn't that the ringing of the telephone in the County Party Committee's office building? Is it from the Prefectural Committee, or from the District Committee? Is it an instruction urging technical innovation or a report of achievements in technical innovation? How many comrades are working tirelessly for the Party and the people.

    山区书简
    林淡秋
    在新社会，人懂得跟时间赛跑，时间又何尝不懂得跟人赛跑呢？我到三门以后，二十多天飞过去了。我想起你们热情的嘱咐，该是向你们报告情况的时候了。
    三门是浙东一个“山里县”，原是我熟悉的故乡，可是久别重临，却有陌生之感了。1950年的初春，三门解放不久，我曾经回到这里住过几天。那时所见所闻，也够使你激动的，可是跟今天的情况一比，我就目瞪口呆了。在历史的长河中，八年是很短的时间，可是这个“山里县”却发生了多大的变化！你瞧，四通八达的汽车路是新的，县城耀眼的电灯是新的，广播站、新华书店、三门戏院、工人俱乐部，以及其他许多建筑物，都是新的，连过去那么熟悉的城区街道和商店也被改造得认不得了。全县自然面貌的变化更为显著，还用得着说人的精神面貌的变化吗？过去上山下田都要脸红的人，如今都以此为光荣了，能劳动而不劳动，才要脸红哩。小学生拾粪，中学生开荒，妇女犁田、插秧，已成风气，干部劳动缺勤，事前请假。新人新事新气象！自然，也有我熟悉的东西。乡音是熟悉的，旧式农具是熟悉的，老法挖土运泥的劳动是熟悉的。熟悉而又陌生，正是跃进中的故乡。
    在多山地带，在滨海地区，最触目的是大大小小的新建水库，是刚被改造过的烂塘田。全县三百多个水库给十多万亩稻田保证了四五十天抗旱能力，而三万多亩烂塘田的改造能使产量大大提高。至于耕作制度方面的变化和各区绿化情况，那就说不尽了。
    你们懂得这些变化的实际意义吗？应该让你们知道一些过去的情况。解放前的三门的特色是三多：山多、烂塘田多、土匪多。多落几天雨，山洪倾泻，一片汪洋，有时再加海潮汹涌，冲击塘堤，塘堤便在内水和外水的夹击下溃决了。人声鼎沸，锣声震天，也阻挡不住老天爷的暴行。一望无际的稻田颗粒无收。连有田有地的人家也往往在一夜之间变成了困难户，叫做“夜穷”，更不用说原来的赤贫户了。那么天不落雨又怎样呢？同样不是好兆头。赤日当空，水无来源，稻田喘气，田禾枯萎，居民又要喊皇天了。为了争水，亲兄弟也会打得头破血流，甚至因争水而酿成两村之间的大规模械斗，全部生产工作都停顿了。因为怕旱，谁也不敢放掉烂塘田里的水，而多水烂田不能种绿肥（草子），而且插秧时需要特别长的秧苗，无法早插早收，结果只能种单季稻。又因有水灾的威胁，谁也不愿精耕细作，合理施肥，只怕全部心血付之东流，大家都抱“靠天吃饭”思想：“有得收，收几斗；没得收，便让鸡搜搜。”所以即使没有水灾旱灾，烂塘田的产量也低得可怜：一般亩产二三百斤，最坏的只有几十斤。“三多”不变，“三灾”无穷，再加苛捐杂税，剥削重重。劳动人民过着怎样的生活，你们难道想像不到？解放以来，三门人民在党的领导下不断改善自己的命运，产量逐年提高，土匪绝迹，那是足以超过以往所谓“路不拾遗夜不闭户”的盛况的了。但在大跃进运动以前，“靠天吃饭”的被动局面并未根本扭转过来。
    大跃进运动在自然面貌上所引起的深刻变化，预约了今年的大丰收。有了这么多水库，事情便好办了。雨天可以蓄水，旱天可以灌溉，有备无患，谁不愿意在党的指挥下挖沟开渠，放掉烂塘田的水，把它改造为两熟丰产田呢？今年产量指标一再跃升，最后确定为平均亩产八百斤。这在过去连梦中也不敢想望的事。今年还要大修水利，全县水利化的伟大计划不久可以实现了。
    水利是农业的命脉，尤其是像三门那样多山靠海的山区、半山区，可是今年大丰收的最大保证，除了水利，还有肥料。经过两星期的突击积肥运动，平均每亩肥料已达五百担以上。这是可以跟三百多个水库工程媲美的奇迹。
    修水库也好，积肥也好，那种热火朝天的集体劳动，会使你激动得说不出话来。白天人潮汹涌，晚上是一片片灯光：汽灯是白的，灯笼和“柴爿灯”都是红的。不分男女老少，无数人家全家关门出勤。数不尽的英雄人物，说不完的模范事迹，看不完的光荣榜！十多万光荣的儿女就用这样开天辟地的精神和排山倒海的劳动改造着贫瘠的山区，写着社会主义的历史。
    不能不特别提到三门妇女的跃进。她们一下子粉碎了守旧思想的束缚，打破了妇女不下田垟的成规，用一切办法解决了家务和生产的矛盾：有的背着小孩上工地，有的领着小孩下田垟，有的在灶门前烧一把火，又到大门外干一下积肥工作。六敖区四百个女英雄在妇女“钢铁队”带头之下苦战九十昼夜，完成了长二百六十公尺、阔十九公尺的“妇女水库”，吸引了成群结队的外地妇女前来参观，大大激发了全县妇女的跃进精神。春耕、插秧的季节到了，劳动力更紧张了，她们自觉地分担迫切的任务，克服了妇女特有的困难，纷纷学会了犁田插秧。在辽阔的田野上，你到处可以看到妇女的身影。
    为什么“山里县”的儿女有那样大的革命干劲呢？浙江省委农业生产检查团台州分团在这里进行了十天深入细致的检查之后，把三门群众的突出干劲同本县各级党委的领导作风和领导方法联系起来，誉为“三宝”。这是三门应得的评价。
    这里领导干部作风的特点是什么呢？就是首先用带头实干的精神去启发群众，教育群众，感动群众，领导群众。在紧要关头，他们总是带头突破困难，披蓑衣，戴笠帽，挖土挑泥，成为普通劳动人民的一员。在奥口乡改造烂塘田的时候，天寒地冻，大风怒号。县委书记杜杰同志首先说一声“干！”，便把衣服脱了，身上剩一件小棉袄，干起来了，群众马上跟上来。雇工出身的县委副书记严汝今同志下区、下乡、下社的时候，总是先同干部和群众一起干一阵之后再讲道理。干部和群众看了他的实干精神之后，再听道理，更加口服心服了。这种领导作风和群众的自觉行动互相影响，互相促进，正如火上浇油，彼此的干劲都越来越旺盛了。
    任何人、任何工作都难免有缺点和错误，问题在于对待缺点和错误的态度。沿江区作出了一些成绩，干部和群众都骄傲自满起来了。县委书记在大雪天穿着草鞋翻山越岭，赶到那里召开区乡党员干部会。区委书记和各乡支书听到这个消息，都感动了。区书因自己在家里打水都滑倒在地上，断定县委书记一定要在路上跌伤，便亲自带着医生和药包到路上来迎接了。在那次会议上，县委书记首先肯定了本区的成绩，然后介绍了比本区更好的工作经验，讲清“骄傲使人落后”的道理。区、乡干部口服心服，思想作风改变了。全区落雨落雪都不停工。
    这里还有一条比较突出的好经验，就是广播会议的经验。在过去，区、乡干部的会议负担是很重的。到县里开会，一开就是五天十天，把脑子弄得糊里糊涂了，带回一大堆任务，还得层层下达。而今天，县委尽量利用广播这种现代化工具，随时直接向各区干部和群众介绍典型经验，布置任务，而且一次一个重点，干脆利落，说什么，做什么。既可节省时间，又能加强实际效果。碰到紧急任务，广播会议的作用就更大了。
    这几天，风和日暖，遍野是深绿色的麦浪和淡绿色的壮秧。生产情况是很好的。可是县委同志说得对，领导生产一点也大意不得，必须关关抓紧，步步留神。县委正在根据省委农业生产检查团的指点，研究、讨论怎样使群众的干劲加上钻劲，怎样讲究工作的节奏，怎样使积肥工作经常化，怎样防止烂秧，怎样掀起技术革新的高潮。办公楼的电灯深夜不熄。像往常一样，他们在这里钻了几天之后，又要分头下去了。
    夜深人倦，我要结束我的信了。可是你听，那不是县委办公楼里电话机的啷啷声？是地委打来的呢，还是区委打来的？是督促技术革新的指示还是报告技术革新的成绩？有多少同志永远不知疲倦地为党为人民工作啊。
