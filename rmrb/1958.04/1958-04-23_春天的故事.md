    The Story of Spring
    By Our Correspondent Feng Jian
    April is the season when the iron mountains of Daye are filled with spring. The gurgling streams, the blossoming tung trees, and the floating willow catkins are all filled with the breath of spring, making people feel refreshed.

    However, what is even more gratifying than the beautiful natural scenery of Tieshan is the rapid pace of mine construction. This year is the most crucial year for the construction of the Daye Iron Mine, and the builders are determined to complete the overburden removal project, as required by the technical design, two to three months ahead of the state plan. These days in Tieshan, everything is in full swing, a scene of great leap forward, and every builder has a spring in their heart.

    "One Dragon" Goes Up the Mountain

    The competition to compare advanced experiences and to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results is being carried out enthusiastically in the mine. Dozens of dump trucks run day and night along the ring roads of Jianshan and Shizi Mountain, transporting the waste rock that is weighing down the ore. Leading the truck race is the Zhang Zhenhai driver team. More than 100 truck drivers in the entire mine are doing everything possible to transport more and load faster, wanting to surpass the Zhang Zhenhai team.

    One evening at the end of March, team leader Ren Baixue secretly talked to Na Kaibin, a driver in the same team. They were discussing: when they go to work tomorrow, they should unite the electric shovel, bulldozer, signalman, and stone picker, cooperate with each other, and they will definitely surpass Zhang Zhenhai. That night, the two of them went to contact the others separately.

    The next day, the Ren Baixue team was on the middle shift. At 3:30 in the afternoon, the smoke from the blasting on Shizi Mountain had not yet dissipated, and the drivers drove their trucks up the mountain half an hour early. The electric shovel, bulldozer, signalman, and stone picker all arrived at the working face on time and in high spirits. Liu Pusheng, the electric shovel driver, said: "Today, I guarantee not to stop, load quickly with a full bucket, and not delay the trucks for a minute." As he spoke, the signalman waved the small flag, and the electric shovel raised its huge bucket and started loading the trucks with a roar.

    That day, the scene was even more tense and coordinated than usual. The bulldozer quickly cleared the working surface for the trucks, the electric shovel loaded the trucks quickly and fully, the signalman was sharp-eyed and quick-handed when directing, and everything was closely coordinated, without wasting a minute. When the shift ended at twelve o'clock at night, it was calculated that five trucks had pulled a total of 417 loads in eight hours, creating the highest record in the history of stone transportation at the Daye Iron Mine.

    The new record quickly spread. The Party branch of the work section highly valued this creation, and went up the mountain the next day to summarize and promote it, saying to everyone that this is a "one dragon" in the mine. From that day on, similar "dragons" appeared in other teams, and the cooperation and coordination between trucks, electric shovels, and bulldozers was greatly strengthened. In all the teams with "dragons", the efficiency of mining and transportation was improved by 10 to 20 percent.

        "Giving Them a Slap in the Face"

    The Daye Iron Mine must remove 4.6 million cubic meters of rock from the mine this year, which is more than what was done in the past three years. More than half of these rocks must be transported by trucks.

    In 1956, the mine transferred nine French-made "Somua" dump trucks. After driving for more than a year, the tires were worn and deformed. Because of the imperialist blockade and embargo, the same tires could not be imported. Seven "Somua" trucks had already stopped running, and the other two were also about to stop. This threatened the mine stripping project.

    This matter made Zhou Liwen, the section chief who was born as a worker, very anxious. The urgent task and bright prospects of mine construction, the No. 1 blast furnace of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation which was in the great leap forward and waiting for ore... churned in his mind day and night. He secretly made up his mind: "I will not give up until I conquer the 'Somua' tires." From then on, he measured the "Somua" wheels with a steel ruler again and again, and often stared at the "Somua" in deep thought.

    One day, Zhou Liwen finally came up with a solution: to modify the high-pressure tire rims of the "Somua" wheels into low-pressure tire rims, and put on domestic tires to replace the French ones.

      "Will the tires explode if we do this?" Zhou Liwen thought, and then doubted himself again. However, based on his rich driving experience, he answered himself with relief: "No, we can increase the air pressure of the domestic tires, and ask the drivers to drive carefully and maintain them more."

    However, when Zhou Liwen drew a sketch of the modification of the "Somua" tires and sent it to the mine's mechanical engineer's office for review, it was opposed. Someone said, "We must be cautious about modifying such important parts," "Let's think about it." Zhou Liwen was not discouraged. He sent his bold idea to the Party Committee of the Iron Mine. The Party Committee immediately convened a meeting of engineering and technical personnel to discuss and study the plan proposed by Zhou Liwen, and instructed the mechanical engineer's office to install one on a trial basis first.

    After trial operation, the trial-installed "Somua" had a good driving effect. Now five "Somua" have been revived with Chinese tires. The drivers honk their horns from time to time on Jianshan and Shizi Mountain, driving happily.

    "The wisdom and strength of the working class are inexhaustible!" Party Branch Secretary Wang Ping said: "The imperialists want to trap us with blockade and embargo. This is a daydream. Look, isn't the revival of 'Somua' a slap in the face to them!"

          Wang Wenhuan's Transformation

    Jianshan and Shizi Mountain face each other from afar. Twelve drilling machines are chasing each other on the two mountains, jumping and competing fiercely.

    Using drilling machines to drill blasting holes is the first process in mine mining and stripping projects. Last spring, each drilling machine could only drill more than three meters of rock per shift, and the mine complained that it was slowing down construction. In this extraordinary spring, the situation has completely changed. The drilling efficiency has more than doubled, and the drilling machine drivers have made great strides forward, leading the way in the mine.

    The drivers of the twelve drilling machines all like to talk about Wang Wenhuan, the driver of drilling machine No. 4, and say that they want to learn from him.

    Wang Wenhuan was originally a drilling machine driver at the Dagushan Iron Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel. In 1956, after hearing that the state was going to build Wuhan Iron and Steel, he volunteered to come to Tieshan. At that time, everything in the mine was in its initial stage, and there were many difficulties. Before long, Wang Wenhuan became a little daunted and wavered. He originally had some arthritis, so he took the opportunity to tell the section chief: "I can't do the work of a drilling machine, please give me a lighter job." From then on, he was silent every day and worked lazily; the other two drivers on the same machine also had their own ideas.

    The great rectification movement awakened Wang Wenhuan. In February of this year, he visited his father's illness and returned to Anshan. On the train, he heard many people talking excitedly about the Party's call to catch up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more; when he arrived at the Dagushan Iron Mine, he saw the drilling machine driver brothers there, working hard and selflessly to catch up with Britain. His younger brother was an electrician in Anshan. When he returned home, his younger brother also said to him: "Brother, in order to catch up with Britain, I gave up the three-month vacation that the factory leaders approved for me to recuperate... If you want to leave the drilling machine and find a lighter job, isn't this dragging down the construction?" What moved him especially was that some leading cadres of the Daye Iron Mine came to the drilling machine to plant "experimental fields," working with everyone regardless of morning or evening.

    Wang Wenhuan deeply regretted it. After living at home for a few days, he hurried back to Tieshan. In those few days, the mine took care of his health and had decided not to let him work the night shift on the mountain. But as soon as Wang Wenhuan returned to the Iron Mine, he found the section chief and said: "Section Chief, I, Wang Wenhuan, am now a different person. No matter what, I will not leave the drilling machine. I will work the night shift and the day shift, and I will do it for the rest of my life."

    After that day, drilling machine No. 4 changed. Wang Wenhuan took the initiative to find the other two drivers to hold a unity meeting, criticized and reviewed each other, and the three of them were as united as one. They worked together to come up with six measures to increase the pure drilling time of each drilling machine shift from more than two hours last year to six hours. In March, they completed the drilling plan nine days ahead of schedule, and the efficiency doubled compared to February; in April, they planned to double it again compared to March. As for Wang Wenhuan himself, because his arthritis has not fully recovered, although it is already spring in Jiangnan, he still wears his oil-stained cotton pants to work every day. However, he is no longer silent, talking and laughing every day, and feeling very comfortable.

    春天的故事
    本报记者　冯健
    4月，正是大冶铁山春暖花开的季节。淙淙的溪流，盛开的桐花，飘絮的柳丝，无处不是春意盎然，令人心旷神怡。
    但是，比起铁山秀丽的自然景色，更令人喜悦的，却是矿山建设疾急的脚步声。今年是大冶铁矿建设最紧张的一年，建设者们决心比国家计划提前两个月到三个月完成技术设计要求的矿山剥离工程。这些天在铁山，处处锣紧鼓密，一片跃进景象，每个建设者的心里，都是一个春天。
    “一条龙”上了山
    比先进，比多快好省的竞赛，在矿山上热烈地进行着。几十部自卸汽车，沿着尖山、狮子山的环山公路日夜奔驰，把压在矿石身上的废石运走。汽车竞赛中领先的是张振海司机小组。全矿一百多名汽车司机都在千方百计地多运快装，要赛过张振海班。
      3月底的一天晚上，小组长任柏学找同组的司机那凯斌悄悄谈话。他们在商议：明天上班时，把电铲、推土机、信号工、拣石工联合起来，前后协作，一定能赛过张振海。当晚，俩人就分头去联络。
    第二天，任柏学小组值中班。下午三时半，狮子山上开山爆破的硝烟还未消散，司机们就驾着汽车提前半小时上山了。电铲、推土机、信号工、拣石工一齐精神抖擞地按时来到了掌子面。电铲司机刘浦生说：“今天我保证不停车，满斗快装，不耽误汽车一分钟。”说时，信号工的小旗一挥，电铲就扬起巨大的铲斗，轰通通地装起车来了。
    这天，现场上比平日又紧张、又协调。推土机快速地为汽车开拓工作面，电铲装车又快又满，信号工指挥时眼明手疾，一切配合得严实合缝，不漏走一分钟工夫。夜晚十二点下班时一算，五台汽车八个小时一共拉了四百一十七车，创造了大冶铁矿运石的历史最高纪录。
    新纪录很快就传开了。工段党支部十分珍视这个创造，第二天就上山总结推广，对大家说这是矿山上的“一条龙”。从这天起，别的班组也纷纷出现了这样的“龙”，汽车、电铲和推土机之间的配合、协作大大加强了。凡是有“龙”的班组，采掘、运输效率，都提高了十分之一、十分之二不等。
        “打了他们一记耳光”
    大冶铁矿今年要从矿山上掀掉四百六十万立方公尺的岩石，比过去三年作的还多。这些岩石，有一半多要靠汽车运走。
    1956年，矿山调来了九部法国造的“苏米亚”牌自卸汽车，行驶了一年多，轮胎都磨损变形了。因为帝国主义封锁禁运，没有同样的轮胎进口，有七部“苏米亚”已经停运，另外两部眼看也将停运。这威胁着矿山剥离工程。
    这件事使工人出身的段长周立文十分焦灼。矿山建设的紧迫任务和美好前景，跃进中的武钢一号高炉等着用矿石
  ……，在他的脑际日夜翻腾。他暗暗下定决心：“不攻下‘苏米亚’轮胎，誓不甘休。”从此，他拿着钢尺在“苏米亚”车轮上量了又量，时常对着“苏米亚”凝神深思。
    一天，周立文终于想出了一个办法：把“苏米亚”车轮的高压胎钢圈改装成低压胎钢圈，套上国产轮胎，代替法国货。
      “这样做，轮胎会不会爆炸呢？”周立文想着想着，又自己怀疑起来。但是，凭他丰富的开车经验，又释然地回答了自己：“不会的，把国产轮胎的气压加大，再叫司机们小心驾驶多维护就行。”
    但是，当周立文绘制了一幅改装“苏米亚”轮胎的草图，送到矿山机械师室审查时，却遭到了反对。有人说什么“改装这样重要的部件要慎重呀”，“考虑考虑吧”。周立文没有灰心，他把自己大胆设想的方案，又送给了铁矿的党委会。党委会立即召集工程技术人员开会，讨论研究周立文提出的方案，并责成机械师室先试装一台看看。
    经过试运转，试装的“苏米亚”行驶效果很好。现在已经有五部“苏米亚”改装上我国轮胎复活了。司机们在尖山、狮子山上不时地响起喇叭，愉快地驾驶着。
    “工人阶级的智慧和力量无穷无尽呵！”党总支书记王平说：“帝国主义者想拿封锁禁运把我们难住，这是白日做梦。你看，复活‘苏米亚’这件事，不就给他们打了一记耳光！”
          王文桓的转变
    尖山和狮子山遥遥相对。十二台穿孔机在两座山上你追我赶，你飞我跃，竞赛闹得很热火。
    用穿孔机穿凿爆破孔，这是矿山采掘、剥离工程的第一道工序。去年春天，穿孔机每个台班只能穿凿岩石三公尺多，矿上都埋怨它拖累了建设。在今年这个不平凡的春天，局势翻了个个儿，穿孔效率提高了一倍多，穿孔机司机们大踏步前进，在矿山上一马领先了。
    十二台穿孔机的司机们，都爱谈到四号穿孔机的司机长王文桓，都说要向他学习。
    王文桓原来是鞍钢大孤山铁矿的穿孔机司机。1956年，听说国家要建设武钢，自愿报名来到铁山。那时，矿山一切都在草创，困难很多。没有多久，王文桓有些畏难，动摇了。他本来有点关节炎病，于是借机找段长说：“我干不了穿孔机的活啦，给我换个轻活干吧。”从此，他天天沉默寡言，工作懒懒散散；同机的其他两个司机也各怀着一条心。
    伟大的整风运动，使王文桓醒过来了。今年2月，他探望父亲的病，回了一趟鞍山。在火车上，他听到许多人在兴奋地谈论党的在十五年或者稍多一点的时间内在主要工业品的产量方面赶上英国的号召；到了大孤山铁矿，他看到那里的穿孔机司机兄弟们，为了赶上英国，在奋发忘我地劳动。他弟弟是鞍山一个电工。回到家里，弟弟也对他说：“哥哥，为了赶上英国，我放弃了工厂领导批准我休养三个月的假期……。你要离开穿孔机，找轻活干，这不是拖着建设的后腿啦？”特别使他感动的是：大冶铁矿一些领导干部到穿孔机上种“试验田”来了，不论早晚，跟大家一起干活。
    王文桓深深悔恨起来了，在家里住了几天，就匆匆赶回铁山。就在那几天，矿上照顾他的身体，已经决定不让他到山上值夜班了。但王文桓刚回到铁矿，就找到段长说：“段长，我王文桓现在是另外一个人了，说什么我也不离开穿孔机了，夜班、白班我都要干，干一辈子。”
    那天以后，四号钻机就变样了。王文桓主动找其他两个司机在一起开了个团结会，互相作了批评、检讨，三个人团结得像一个人一样。他们同心合力，想了六条措施，把穿孔机每班的纯钻时间，从去年的两个多小时提高到了六个小时。3月份他们提前九天完成了穿孔计划，效率比2月份翻了一番；4月份他们计划比3月份再翻上一番。至于王文桓自己，因为他的关节炎没有全好，虽说江南已是春暖花开了，每天还穿着那条沾满油渍的棉裤上班。不过，他早已不再沉默寡言了，天天有说有笑，心情十分舒畅。
