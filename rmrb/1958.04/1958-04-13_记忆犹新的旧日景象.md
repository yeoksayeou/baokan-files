Old Scenery, Fresh in Memory

    Hemp and jute were in short supply, steel mills shut down, shipbuilding orders were cancelled, Dundee, a town destined to suffer, had almost five thousand people on relief! Now foundry workers were joining the ranks of those queuing on the dock street; lately, it seemed as if the clock was turning back, for every job opening, there were ten waiting at the door; old scenes, fresh in memory, are appearing again, if the Conservative Party doesn't step down, it will continue to spread! Their promises of peace are bankrupt as tons of atomic bombs are loaded onto supply bombers. Mr. Dulles forbids people from making statements aimed at ending the world stalemate; but the great security they are planning is security for supermen! On our coast, rocket bases sound their alarms, in our stores, prices skyrocket; familiar old scenes are appearing again, if the Conservative Party doesn't step down, it will continue to spread!
    (The above poem was written by Alex Russell, a foundry worker in Dundee, England. The so-called "old scenes" refer to the capitalist world economic crisis of the 1930s. This poem was originally published in the London "Daily Worker" on April 1st. — Xinhua News Agency)

### 记忆犹新的旧日景象

    记忆犹新的旧日景象黄麻缺货，钢铁厂停工，造船厂的订货取消了，敦提，注定要忍受苦难的城镇，差不多有五千人领着救济金！现在翻砂厂的失业者们，又加入了到船坞街排队的人群；近来时针好像在倒转，招聘一个人，等候在门口的倒有十个；记忆犹新的旧日景象又在出现，保守党不下台，它将继续扩大蔓延！他们许下的和平诺言，随着供给轰炸机装载的成吨原子弹而破产。杜勒斯先生禁止人们发表目的在结束世界僵局的言论；可是他们所筹划的伟大安全是供超人享受的安全！我们的海岸边，火箭基地发出鸣响，我们的商店里，价格火箭般飞腾直上；人所熟知的旧日景象又在出现，保守党不下台，它将继续扩大蔓延！
    （上面这首诗是英国敦提城翻砂工人阿历克斯·鲁塞尔写的。所谓“旧日景象”是指三十年代的资本主义世界经济危机。这首诗原载4月1日伦敦“工人日报”——新华社）
