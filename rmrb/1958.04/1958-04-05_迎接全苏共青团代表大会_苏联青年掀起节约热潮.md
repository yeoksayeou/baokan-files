Moscow, April 3rd (By Our Correspondent) The Thirteenth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League will open in Moscow on April 15th. Currently, Komsomol organizations throughout the Soviet Union are actively preparing to welcome the upcoming Congress. Republican youth congresses have been held in almost all the capitals of the fifteen union republics.

In the four years since the closing of the Twelfth Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, the League has played a remarkable role in communist construction. Hundreds of thousands of League members responded to the call of the CPSU Central Committee and came to Siberia and Kazakhstan, cultivating millions of hectares of virgin land. They overcame numerous difficulties, established many new farms, and provided the country with billions of poods of grain. Many other League members participated in the construction of industrial areas in the eastern Soviet Union. In cities like Stalinsk and Chelyabinsk, Komsomol work teams undertook the construction of seven blast furnaces and ensured the completion of the task ahead of schedule.

In order to greet the convening of the Thirteenth Congress, youth across the Soviet Union have launched a campaign to save steel for the country and make full use of machinery and equipment. Under the call of the League Central Committee, Komsomol shock inspection teams have been established in factories and mines in major cities. In Rostov, there are more than 500 such inspection teams. They conducted thorough inspections of factories and enterprises, and immediately requested factories and people's economic committees to help resolve any waste they discovered. In addition, young office workers and students in many cities have participated in the Komsomol's scrap metal collection campaign. In Azov, 4,000 people collected 700 tons of scrap metal during a Sunday of voluntary labor.

This conservation movement not only exists in cities but has also spread to the vast countryside.

    迎接全苏共青团代表大会
    苏联青年掀起节约热潮
    本报莫斯科3日电　全苏列宁共产主义青年团第十三次代表大会将于本月15日在莫斯科开幕。现在全苏各地的共青团组织正在进行积极的准备工作迎接即将召开的代表大会。在十五个加盟共和国的首都几乎全都举行了共和国的团代表大会。
    在全苏列宁共产主义青年团第十二次代表大会闭幕以后的四年中，全苏列宁共产主义青年团在共产主义建设中起了卓越的作用。成千上万的团员响应了苏共中央的号召，来到西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦，开垦了几百万公顷生荒地。他们克服了重重困难，建立起许多新的农场，为国家提供了亿万普特的粮食。还有许多团员参加了苏联东部工业区的建设工作。在斯大林斯克、车里亚宾斯克等地的共青团工作队担任了七座高炉的修建工作，并保证提前完成任务。
    为了迎接第十三次团代表大会的召开，苏联各地青年又展开了为国家节省钢铁和充分利用机器设备的运动。在团中央的号召下，在各大城市的厂矿中都成立了共青团突击检查队。在罗斯托夫市这样的检查队有五百多个。他们去工厂企业中进行了彻底的检查，发现出的浪费现象立即请求工厂和人民经济委员会来帮助解决。除此以外，许多城市的青年职员和学生都参加了团员拾废铁的运动。在阿卓夫市的一个星期日的义务劳动中四千人拾到的废铁达七百吨之多。
    这样的节约运动不但在城市有，而且已普及到了广大的农村。
