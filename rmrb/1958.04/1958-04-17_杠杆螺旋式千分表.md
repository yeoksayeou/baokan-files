    Lever Spiral Dial Indicator
    The tool workshop of the state-owned Nanjing Radio Factory has successfully trial-produced a lever spiral dial indicator, which is a precision measuring tool in industrial production. It is used for comparative measurement and absolute measurement of dimensions and geometric shapes; it is especially suitable for workpieces being processed on machine tools and for correcting and inspecting deformed workpieces. The measuring direction can be arbitrarily rotated and changed within 180 degrees. It can measure planes, as well as the outer and inner diameters of circles. This indicator is also equipped with a light and convenient reversing mechanism, and the measuring head can also be rotated. The main bearings of this indicator are made of agate, which is more wear-resistant than diamond.

    杠杆螺旋式千分表
    国营南京有线电厂工具车间，试制成功杠杆螺旋式千分表，这是一种工业生产中的精密量具。它是用在比较测量和绝对测量尺寸和几何形状；特别适用于机床上被加工之工件及校正和检验畸形工件。测量方向可以在一百八十度之内任意旋转和改变，可以测量平面，也可以测量圆的外径和内径，这种表还备有一种轻便的换向机构，量头也可以转动。这种表的主要轴承是用玛瑙做的，比钻石耐磨。
