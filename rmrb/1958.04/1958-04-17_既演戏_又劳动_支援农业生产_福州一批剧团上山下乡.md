　　Acting and Laboring, Supporting Agricultural Production
　　Fuzhou A Batch of Theater Troupes Go to the Countryside
　　(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Fujian Daily: To respond to the call of drama serving the masses and serving production, many theater troupes in Fujian Province have decided to go to the mountains and the countryside to present first-class programs to the farmers.
　　The 38 state-run and private professional theater troupes in the Jinjiang Special District recently gathered in Quanzhou City and decided to launch a high tide of going to the countryside and mountains, going deep into industrial and mining areas and remote areas to tour and perform, striving to eliminate performance-blank villages in the next two years, so that the masses in all 1,116 villages in the special district can see the opera. The Provincial Minnan Opera Experimental Troupe will spend 88% of its time performing in the countryside and mountains this year. In July, they will cross the Hubao Pass in Yongchun, ascend the Daiyun Mountain in Dehua, and go to Fuling, one of the highest peaks in Fujian Province, to perform for local farmers.
　　The theater troupes that have already gone to the countryside and mountains are in high spirits. Some have achieved "performing at night and laboring during the day," which has been highly praised by the masses. When the Yongtai County Min Opera Troupe went to the countryside, they carried their own luggage and participated in local agricultural cooperative labor when they had time. Recently, when this troupe went to Gaiyang, Changguang and other villages to perform, the actors happily carried loads of fifty or sixty pounds, trekking through mountains and ridges to reach their destination; when performing in the villages, they also participated in labor. The first team of the Provincial New New Acrobatic Troupe, with more than 20 people, went to the Yongfu Old District in Zhangping to perform more than 40 wonderful programs such as biting flowers, head-topping high poles, foot-pedaling thousands of pounds, five-person ladder, and five-person springboard for local farmers. There were more than 7,900 audiences in five consecutive performances. During the daytime rest time, they helped the Shilin farming team of the Fuli Cooperative to repair the reservoir. In addition, actors and staff of theater troupes such as the Xianyou Qunming Troupe, the Provincial Min Opera Experimental Troupe, and the Fuqing Heping Min Opera Troupe also actively participated in the labor of local agricultural cooperatives.
　　The artists' actions have greatly inspired the farmers in various places. After the Provincial Min Opera Experimental Troupe participated in labor in the Ruiyun Agricultural Cooperative in Fuqing Chengguan, the farmers in the town lit gas lamps that night to improve the soil and repair water conservancy facilities. The farmers of the Changle Hongqi Cooperative saw the actors of the Fuqing Heping Min Opera Troupe helping them accumulate fertilizer, and their enthusiasm for the Great Leap Forward was even greater. They unanimously stated that they would use Sun Wukong's energy in creating havoc in the heavenly palace to accumulate enough fertilizer for spring plowing in advance.

### 既演戏  又劳动  支援农业生产  福州一批剧团上山下乡

    既演戏  又劳动  支援农业生产
    福州一批剧团上山下乡
    本报讯　据福建日报报道：福建省许多剧团，为了响应戏剧为群众服务，为生产服务的号召，决定上山下乡，把第一流节目献给农民。
    晋江专区各县的三十八个国营和民间职业剧团，最近在泉州市集会，决定掀起下乡上山的热潮，深入工矿和边远地区去巡回演出，争取在今后两年内消灭演出空白乡，让全专区一千一百十六个乡的群众，都能看到戏。省闽南戏实验剧团今年将有88％的时间下乡上山演出。7月间，他们将跨过永春的虎豹关，高登德化的戴云山，到福建省最高峰之一的佛岭，去为当地农民演出。
    已经下乡上山的剧团，情绪十分高涨，有的做到了“晚上演戏，白天劳动”，深受群众赞扬。永泰县闽剧团下乡的时候自己挑行李，有空就参加当地农业社劳动。最近这个剧团到盖洋、长广等乡演出时，演员们都愉快地挑着五、六十斤重的担子，翻山越岭赶到目的地；在乡里演出时，也都参加了劳动。省新新杂技团第一队二十余人，到漳平永福老区，给当地农民演出了咬花、头顶高竿、足蹬千斤、五人梯、五人幌板等四十多个精采节目，一连五场观众有七千九百多人。他们在白天休息时间，就帮助福里社石林耕作队修水库。此外，像仙游群鸣剧团、省闽剧实验剧团、福清和平闽剧团等剧团的演员、职员们，也都积极地参加了当地农业社的劳动。
    艺人们这种行动，给了各地农民极大的鼓舞。省闽剧实验剧团在福清城关瑞云农业社参加了劳动后，当晚全镇农民点起汽灯改良土壤、修水利。长乐红旗社的农民看见福清和平闽剧团的演员们帮助他们积肥，跃进劲头更足，一致表示要用孙悟空大闹天宫的干劲提前积足春耕用肥。
