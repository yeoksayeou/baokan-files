Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: TASS reports: First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, said in Kursk on the 25th that it is beyond doubt that the Soviet Union will catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita agricultural production.

He said that we all hope to reach the current production level of the United States as soon as possible, and develop faster, producing more products than the United States, so that the Soviet people can live a better life day by day. This is our main task.

Khrushchev made these remarks at the award ceremony in Kursk Oblast. This Oblast was awarded the Order of Lenin for its great achievements in developing agriculture.

Khrushchev said that the Party Central Committee and the government are now formulating measures to further vigorously develop the Soviet chemical industry, so that some new chemical plants can be established soon to produce materials that can manufacture beautiful, durable, and inexpensive daily necessities. Khrushchev said that we believe that in this way, we will be able to catch up with the United States in many products in the near future.

Khrushchev said that while the Communist Party and the Soviet government are fighting for world peace, they are constantly concerned with strengthening our national defense capabilities. The Soviet army has excellent weapons, tanks, airplanes, rockets, and also has nuclear weapons. But our most important wealth is the wealth created by human labor. Producing more metal, coal, chemical products, producing more butter and sugar, and building more houses and schools are what we are pursuing.

Referring to the issue of exempting collective farmers' private plots from delivering agricultural products, Khrushchev said that last year, when we exchanged views on this measure, the participants of the anti-Party group, Kaganovich, Malenkov, and Molotov, said that it was impossible to exempt collective farmers' private plots from the obligation to sell agricultural products, because then the urban residents would have nothing to eat. The Party Central Committee and the government exempted 20 million collective farmers from the obligation to sell meat, milk, and other products, and as a result, the quantity purchased not only did not decrease, but increased, and the commodities sold to residents also increased. In the first quarter of this year, 53,000 tons more meat and meat products and 16,000 tons more animal oil were sold to residents than in the same period last year.

    赫鲁晓夫在库尔斯克授勋会上说
    苏农产品产量定要赶过美国
    据新华社26日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫25日在库尔斯克说，苏联在按人口平均计算的农产品产量方面赶上和超过美国，这是毫无疑问的。
    他说，我们大家都希望尽快地达到美国现在的生产水平，并以更快的速度向前发展，生产出比美国更多的产品，使苏联人民生活得日益美好。这就是我们的主要任务。
    赫鲁晓夫是在库尔斯克州授勋大会上讲这些话的。这个州由于在发展农业上取得了巨大成就，而荣获列宁勋章。
    赫鲁晓夫说，党中央和政府现在正在制定进一步大力发展苏联化学工业的措施，以便最近建立一些新的化学工厂，生产可以制造漂亮、耐用、便宜的日用品的材料。赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，这样一来，我们在许多产品上就有可能在不久的将来赶上美国。
    赫鲁晓夫说，共产党和苏联政府一面进行着争取世界和平的斗争，同时不断地关怀着加强我国的国防能力。苏联军队拥有优良的武器、坦克、飞机、火箭，并且也拥有核武器。但是我们的最重要的财富是人的劳动所创造的财富。生产更多的金属、煤、化学产品，生产更多的牛油、糖，建设更多的住宅和学校，这些是我们所追求的。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到集体农民的宅旁园地免予交售农产品的问题时说，去年在我们就这一措施交换意见时，反党集团的参加者卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、莫洛托夫说，免除集体农民宅旁园地交售农产品的义务是不行的，因为那样一来城市居民就没有吃的了。党中央和政府免除了二千万户集体农民交售肉、牛奶和其他产品的义务，结果采购的数量不但没有降低，反而增加了，向居民出售的商品也增加了。今年第一季度向居民出售的肉和肉类制品比去年同期多了五万三千吨，动物油多了一万六千吨。
