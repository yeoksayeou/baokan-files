Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, and Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, today issued statements regarding the Soviet government's declaration on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear weapon testing explosions, and its call for the UK and US to take similar action, is a great peaceful initiative concerning the happiness of all mankind and their descendants on Earth. It not only expresses the Soviet people's consistent and unremitting efforts to consolidate world peace, but also reflects the common desire of the people of all countries for peace." Lai Ruoyu said: "On behalf of the Chinese workers who are engaged in selfless peaceful labor, I express my heartfelt support and gratitude for the Soviet proposal."

Lai Ruoyu said that the Soviet Union has set an example for the United States, Britain and other countries in stopping nuclear weapons testing, "We Chinese workers resolutely demand that the United States, Britain and other countries abandon all kinds of excuses and take practical actions like the Soviet Union to stop nuclear weapons testing. Any rhetoric will only be spurned by the people of the world. As far as the United States itself is concerned, its arms expansion, war preparations and atomic blackmail policies have already brought serious disasters to the American people, especially the American workers. If they still refuse to listen to the demands of the people of all countries, the US imperialists will only be ‘lifting a rock to drop it on their own feet’.”

Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said that just as American imperialism is stepping up its arms expansion and war preparations, building rocket bases everywhere, accelerating the transport of atomic weapons to various countries, and continuing nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific, the Soviet Union issued a resolution on unilaterally stopping atomic and hydrogen weapons testing. This is another important contribution by the Soviet Union to promoting world peace, "We Chinese women welcome this great peaceful initiative of the Soviet Union with infinite excitement and gratitude." Cai Chang said, "We believe that this major Soviet peace initiative and measure will further encourage the confidence and determination of women and mothers in all countries to defend peace."

Cai Chang concluded by saying, "We can no longer allow the US and British governments to turn a deaf ear to the universal call for a halt to nuclear weapons testing. We demand that they accept the Soviet initiative and immediately halt nuclear weapons testing to ensure the safety and happiness of mankind and future generations."

This newspaper also reports that prominent Chinese peace activists Ma Xulun and Ji Fang issued statements regarding the Soviet government's declaration on the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing.

Ma Xulun said: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided to unilaterally stop nuclear weapons testing and called on the governments of other countries possessing nuclear weapons to take the same measures. This is a great initiative by the Soviet Union to promote world peace and benefit mankind. The US government disregarded the Soviet initiative and continued to conduct its planned nuclear weapons tests this spring and summer, and attempted to belittle the enormous significance of the Soviet government's declaration. British, French and West German officials sang the same tune. This behavior, which violates the desire for peace of the people of the world, will surely be condemned by world public opinion. The power of the people of the world to defend peace is growing stronger day by day. We must warn the ruling groups of the United States, Britain and other countries that if you insist on continuing to engage in the nuclear arms race, endangering world peace and threatening human security, then "those who play with fire will burn themselves."

Ji Fang said: American imperialism is intensifying the testing and production of nuclear weapons despite the opposition of the people of the world and the American people. The US government has already issued a statement regarding the Soviet resolution, completely disregarding the wishes of the people of the world and continuing to insist on testing nuclear weapons. Who truly loves peace is completely clear in the hearts of the people of the world. The attitude of the US government is not at all unexpected, but from the perspective of human safety and happiness, we have the right to demand that the US government and the British government seriously and cautiously consider the Soviet resolution and take the same measures as the Soviet Union to stop the testing, production, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons, and to destroy nuclear weapons.

    促进世界和平的又一重要贡献
    赖若愚、蔡畅、廖承志、马叙伦、季方就苏联停止核武器试验发表谈话
    据新华社3日讯　中华全国总工会主席赖若愚、中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅、中华全国民主青年联合会主席廖承志，今天分别就苏联政府关于停止原子武器和氢武器试验的声明发表谈话。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚说：“苏联单方面停止核武器试验爆炸，并呼吁英美也采取同样行动的建议，是关系着地球上整个人类和他们子孙幸福的伟大的和平创举。它不只是表达了苏联人民对巩固世界和平始终不懈的努力，更反映了世界各国人民对和平的共同愿望。”赖若愚说：“我代表正在以忘我精神进行和平劳动的中国工人，对苏联的这个建议表示衷心的拥护和感激。”
    赖若愚说，苏联在停止试验核武器方面，已经为美英等国作出了样子，“我们中国工人坚决要求美英等国丢掉各种借口，像苏联一样拿出实际行动来，停止核武器试验。任何花言巧语，都只会受到世界人民的唾弃。就美国本身来说，由于他的扩军备战和原子讹诈政策，已经给美国人民、尤其是美国工人带来了严重的灾难。如果现在仍然拒绝倾听各国人民的要求，
  ‘搬起石头打自己脚’的，将是美帝国主义者自己。”
    中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会主席蔡畅说，正当美帝国主义加紧扩军备战，到处建立火箭基地，加紧向各国运输原子武器、并且将在太平洋上继续试验核武器的时候，苏联发表了关于单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题的决议，这是苏联对促进世界和平的又一重要贡献，“我们中国妇女以无限兴奋和感激心情欢迎苏联这一伟大的和平创举。”蔡畅说：“我们相信苏联这一重大和平倡议和措施将更加鼓舞各国妇女和母亲们保卫和平的斗争信心和决心。”
    蔡畅最后说：“我们再也不能容许美英政府对要求停止核武器试验的普遍呼声充耳不闻了，我们要求它们接受苏联的倡议，立即停止试验核武器，以保障人类和未来一代的安全与幸福。”
    中华全国民主青年联合会主席廖承志说，中国青年热烈地欢迎和衷心地拥护苏联政府的这一伟大声明，“这个声明是对巩固世界和平的一个卓越的贡献。它表达了中国青年和全世界亿万爱好和平的青年的崇高愿望。”
    本报讯　中国著名和平人士马叙伦、季方就苏联政府关于停止原子武器和氢武器试验的声明发表了谈话。
   马叙伦说：苏联最高苏维埃决定单方面停止核武器试验，并向拥有核武器的其他国家政府呼吁采取同样的措施。这是苏联促进世界和平、造福人类的伟大创举。美国政府竟不顾苏联的倡议，仍要进行它预定今年春夏举行的核武器试验，并妄图竭力贬低苏联政府声明的巨大意义。英法和西德官方也唱着同样的调子。这种违背世界人民和平愿望的行为，必将受到全世界舆论的谴责。全世界人民保卫和平的力量一天比一天壮大，我们要警告美英等国的统治集团，如果你们一意孤行继续玩弄核军备竞赛，危害世界和平和威胁人类安全，那么，“玩火者必自焚”。
    季方说：美帝国主义不顾世界人民和美国人民的反对，加紧核武器的试验和生产。美国政府对于苏联的决议已经发表声明，它完全不顾世界人民的愿望，仍坚持试验核武器。谁真正热爱和平，在全世界人民心中完全了然。美国政府的态度毫不在我们的预料之外，不过我们从人类的安全与幸福出发，有权要求美国政府和英国政府认真慎重地对待苏联的决议，与苏联采取同样的措施，停止试验、生产、贮备、使用核武器并销毁核武器。
