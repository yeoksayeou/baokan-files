Right and Wrong at the Dinner Table

　　Aunt Zhang came to our house for a chat, and somehow the conversation turned to grain. She said, "The government is good in every way, but there's just not enough grain to eat." Yesterday, at the rectification meeting in the neighborhood, Aunt Tian from number forty said the same thing. Although everyone disagreed with her, she didn't seem to understand. There's a big principle involved in this small matter. In my opinion, saying there's not enough grain to eat is a lie. Some neighbors are always complaining about not having enough to eat, but I haven't seen anyone go hungry. Saying there's not enough to eat is because, first, they haven't calculated carefully, and second, they only care about their own convenience in using grain, and don't think about the country.

　　Isn't that so? We all used to have a habit of trying to save a little more grain each month, fearing that the grain wouldn't last until the end of the month. In fact, everyone has their own share of rations, so there's no need to worry about not having enough to eat. Isn't it better to store grain in the state's granaries than in your own kitchen? Now, there's no worry about not being able to buy it, and no fear of price increases, so why stuff yourself today and starve tomorrow? I've seen some sisters-in-law who don't plan their cooking, and always like to cook an extra bowl of rice, preferring to waste the leftovers. There are also some neighbors who have guests reporting temporary residence and staying for several months, and they are embarrassed to ask the guests for grain coupons. In this way, of course, there won't be enough grain.

　　Now, every time it's mealtime, isn't every table full of rice, steamed buns, and pastries? Isn't everyone eating their fill? Thinking back to the years when we had to stand in line for half a day just to buy grain, who can say that today's planned grain supply isn't good?

　　You have to have a sense of proportion in everything you do, and it's the same with using grain. I advise the sisters to carefully calculate how to use their monthly grain reasonably. Don't just think about your own convenience and ignore the interests of everyone. As the saying goes, "Think of the difficulty of obtaining every grain of rice and every bowl of porridge," saving grain is everyone's responsibility. If everyone saves grain with the attitude of a master, this matter will be easy to handle.

### 饭桌上的是非

    饭桌上的是非
    张大妈上我们家串门，不知怎么一来就说到粮食，她说：“政府什么都好，就是粮食不大够吃。”昨天，在街道整风会上，四十号里的田大姐也这么说过，大伙儿虽是不同意她的话，可是她思想好像也没有通。这件小事情里，也有个大道理。依我看呀，说粮食不够吃是假话。有些街坊整天吵着不够吃，可我没见谁饿过肚子。说不够吃，一来是因为没有精打细算，二来是只顾自己用粮方便，不为国家着想。
    不是么？咱们过去都有个习惯，总想每月多存点粮，惟恐粮食吃不到月底。其实，每人都有自己的一份口粮，根本不用愁不够吃。把粮食存在国家的仓库里，不是比存在自己的厨房里更好吗？现在，一不愁买不到，二不怕涨价，何苦饱在肚里，饿在嘴上呢？我见过，有些大嫂做饭没有计划，总爱多煮碗把米，宁愿把剩下的饭浪费掉；也有些街坊家里来的客人报临时户口，一住几个月，不好意思向客人要粮票。这样，粮食当然就不够了。
    现在，一到吃饭时候，哪儿桌上不是摆满大米饭、馒头、饽饽？哪家大小不是吃饱了算？想一想过去排半天队买不上粮食的年月，谁能说今天的粮食计划供应不好呢？
    做任何事心里都得有个数，用粮食也是这样。我劝大姐们好好盘算一下每月的粮食怎样合理地使用。不要只顾自己方便，就不管大家的利益。俗话说：“一粥一饭当思来处不易”，节约粮食人人有责，大家都用主人翁的态度节约用粮，这事情就好办了。
