Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 2nd: TASS reports that the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, pointed out to the special correspondent of the Italian newspaper "Il Tempo," Paloczi, that Italy's participation in the North Atlantic Group subjects it to policies that will not bring any benefit to its future. The establishment of American atomic bases on Italian territory will involve Italy in actions that are extremely dangerous to its future.

Khrushchev also said that if Italy chooses the path of neutrality and non-participation in military blocs, the Soviet Union will give this decision due understanding and respect.

Khrushchev received the Italian reporter on March 24th and answered the various questions he raised.

In the conversation, Khrushchev said that Italy's participation in the North Atlantic Group has caused understandable concern among the broadest strata of the Italian people. One cannot close one's eyes to the fact that since Italy joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it has increasingly become the object of policies unrelated to it, rather than an important factor in international affairs. In peacetime, American atomic bases have been established on Italian territory, which not only does not help strengthen Italy's security but weakens it. Moreover, in addition to the existing military bases, some people want to force Italy to build ballistic missile launch sites, which would make Italy even more dangerous.

Khrushchev pointed out that recently, increasingly loud voices have been heard in Italy calling for Italy to participate in a nuclear-weapon-free and hydrogen-weapon-free zone, that is, to demand that Italy implement atomic neutrality. At the same time, the tendency in Italy to demand broad neutrality is also becoming increasingly strong. Historical experience tells us that the implementation of a neutral policy or a policy of non-participation in military blocs by certain countries during wartime has better ensured the safety of their people and has generally played a positive role in promoting peace.

Khrushchev said, we believe that if any country is willing to join a nuclear-weapon-free zone, then we can also provide them with the above-mentioned guarantees. For example, an agreement can be reached whereby major powers possessing nuclear weapons guarantee respect for the status of the nuclear-weapon-free zone.

Khrushchev continued, Italy and other countries that have joined the so-called "Common Market" and the European Atomic Energy Community may not be able to obtain any real benefits from them. He believes that the establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community and the six-nation "Common Market" artificially restricts economic cooperation. Moreover, the facts show that the "Common Market" and the European Atomic Energy Community were used from the very beginning less to achieve economic goals than to expand armaments and other non-peaceful purposes.

Regarding whether the Soviet Union is willing to help Italy in the peaceful use of atomic energy, Khrushchev replied that the Soviet Union understands Italy's desire for the peaceful use of atomic energy and is willing to conclude a bilateral agreement with Italy to provide assistance in all aspects of the peaceful use of atomic energy. As for discussing the practical issues of such cooperation, it is obviously too early to talk about them now, because the Italian side has not mentioned such issues at all.

Paloczi asked: If it is expected that the current crisis situation of the American economy will have an adverse impact on Italy's economic development and industrial development, especially on the southern region which is now in the stage of industrialization, will the Soviet Union agree to provide economic assistance to Italy, and what are the conditions?

Khrushchev said that if necessary, we can introduce to Italy our experience in how to develop and economically develop our economically backward areas. Our assistance in this area can also take other forms. We might as well talk about the issue of power sources. New power sources, especially atomic energy equipment, can greatly promote the economic development of the southern provinces of Italy.

It is very clear that the Soviet Union will not put forward any political conditions that would harm the interests and national sovereignty of a country when providing assistance.

Paloczi asked Khrushchev whether he believes that mutual visits and exchanges of opinions between Italian and Soviet leaders would help bring the two countries closer together, and whether he believes that mutual visits by the heads of the two countries are feasible.

Khrushchev said that it is not only feasible but also necessary for state activists to have contacts and meetings on these or those international issues. There is no doubt that they help strengthen mutual understanding and trust. However, meetings between national leaders will only be beneficial if both parties have a desire to hold such meetings. However, the Italian government and Italian leaders are not willing to meet.

Khrushchev continued, we will patiently wait for better times, and the development of the situation shows that such better times will undoubtedly come.

Referring to the statement issued after the recent visit of the Soviet Communist Party delegation to Italy, Khrushchev said that some people in Italy deliberately distorted the statement issued by our delegation. These people in Italy cannot take the lead in this regard, because the American ruling clique, which wants to create disputes between the workers' and communist parties of various countries, has long fabricated such slanders, saying that the communist parties of various countries are all subordinate to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This is nonsense. But, regrettably, there are still people who believe this nonsense.

Our delegation talked about correctly understanding the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and about issues of an ideological nature in the statement. The doctrine of Marxism-Leninism is the banner of the international workers' movement. Therefore, when representatives of the communist parties of the two countries meet, it is natural for them to express their loyalty to the revolutionary ideology—Marxism-Leninism.

Talking about the summit meeting, Khrushchev said that in our opinion, it is possible to hold the summit meeting within the next two months. This is in the sense that there are now all the grounds for holding a high-level meeting to exchange views. What is needed is the willingness and sincerity of the governments of all countries that may participate in the summit meeting. But it seems that this meeting will not be held within the next two months. The leaders of Western countries, especially the United States, want to delay the summit meeting as much as possible. In short, it gives the impression that they are not even willing to hold such a meeting.

In order to bury the proposal for a summit meeting itself, those who oppose holding a summit meeting clamor for good preparations for the meeting, thereby introducing the resolution of the meeting's problems into a maze of verbal battles. They verbally express their willingness to participate in the meeting, but in reality, they are confusing the public, attempting to first delay the meeting, and then use some means to create a tense situation, so as to sabotage the meeting under the pretext of grand reasons and continue the "Cold War."

Khrushchev said that now the public is exerting great pressure on their own governments. The greater the pressure of public opinion on the government, the stronger the confidence in holding high-level meetings. Those issues that can be decided in favor of world peace have matured.

Khrushchev finally said that we are willing to maintain the best relations with the Italian people and the Italian government. However, it is regrettable that the Italian government is now pursuing a policy that hinders the establishment of friendly relations between our two countries. But as time goes by, the situation will change. We believe that if not now, then in the near future our two countries will establish good relations. This is beneficial to both the Soviet Union and Italy.

    赫鲁晓夫答意大利记者问美国企图先拖延然后破坏高级会议
    意大利如不参加军事集团对自己有利
    新华社2日讯据塔斯社莫斯科2日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫对意大利“时代报”特派记者帕洛齐指出，意大利参加北大西洋集团使它从属于不会给它的前途带来任何好处的政策。在意大利领土上建立美国原子基地，会把意大利牵连到对它的前途极为危险的行动中。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，如果意大利选择了中立和不参加军事集团的道路，苏联会给予这个决定以应有的理解和尊重。
    赫鲁晓夫是在3月24日接见这位意大利记者，并回答他所提出的各项问题的。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈话中说，意大利参加北大西洋集团引起了意大利最广泛阶层的人们理所当然的忧虑。不能闭眼不看，意大利参加北大西洋公约组织以后，就从作为国际事务中的重要因素日益变成同它不相干的政策的对象。在和平时期，意大利的领土上建立了美国原子基地，这不但无助于加强意大利的安全，反而削弱它的安全。况且，除了现有军事基地外，还有人想强迫意大利修建弹道火箭发射场，这一来意大利的危险更加严重了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，最近，在意大利发出越来越响亮的声音，要求意大利参加无原子武器和氢武器区，即要求意大利实行原子中立。同时，在意大利要求实行广义的中立的倾向也日渐强烈。历史经验告诉我们，某些国家在战争期间执行中立政策或不参加军事集团的政策，使本国人民的安全得到了较好的保证，总的说来起了促进和平的良好作用。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，假如哪一个国家愿意加入无原子武器地区，那么也可以对他们提供上述保证。例如，可以取得协议，由拥有原子武器的大国保证尊重无原子区的地位。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，意大利以及其他加入所谓“共同市场”和欧洲原子能联营组织的国家，未必能从其中得到什么实实在在的好处。他认为，欧洲原子能联营组织和六国“共同市场”的建立人为地限制了经济合作，何况，事实表明，“共同市场”和欧洲原子能联营组织从一开始，与其说是被用来达到经济目的，不如说是被用来达到扩充军备以及其他非和平性质的目的。
    关于苏联是否愿意在和平利用原子能方面帮助意大利的问题，赫鲁晓夫回答说，苏联对意大利和平利用原子能的愿望是理解的，并且愿意同意大利缔结在和平利用原子能的各方面给予帮助的双边协定。至于谈到这种合作的实际问题，现在去谈它们，显然是为时过早，因为意大利方面根本没有提到过这种问题。
    帕洛齐问：如果预料到，美国经济的目前危机状况会对意大利的经济发展和工业发展、特别是对现在正在工业化阶段的南部地区产生不利影响，苏联是否同意对意大利的经济给以援助，条件如何？
    赫鲁晓夫说，必要的话，我们可以把我国如何开发和在经济上发展我国经济落后地区的经验介绍给意大利。我们这一方面的援助也可以采取其他形式。不妨拿动力来源这一问题来谈一谈。新的动力来源，特别是原子能装备，可以大大促进意大利南部各省经济的发展。
    十分清楚，苏联提供援助时它不会提出任何损害某一国家利益和民族主权的政治条件。
    帕洛齐问赫鲁晓夫，他是否认为，意大利和苏联领导人相互访问和交换意见会有助于两国之间的相互接近，是否认为两国首脑人物的相互访问是能够办得到的事情。
    赫鲁晓夫说，国家活动家就这些或那些国际问题进行接触和会晤，不仅是可以办得到的事情，而且是必须办到的事情。毫无疑问，它们有助于加强相互了解和信任。但是，只有双方都有进行这种会晤的愿望，国家领导人的会晤才会带来好处。但是，意大利政府和意大利领导人士并不愿意会晤。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们将耐心地等待较好的时光，而事态的发展说明这种较好的时光无疑将会来到。
    谈到苏共代表团不久前访问意大利后发表的声明，赫鲁晓夫说，意大利的某些人士故意歪曲我国代表团所发表的声明。意大利的这些人士是无法在这方面占先了，因为想在各国工人党和共产党之间制造纠纷的美国统治集团早就捏造过这样的谰言，说各国共产党都是服从苏联共产党的。这是胡说八道。但是，遗憾的是，竟还有人相信这种瞎话。
    我们的代表团在声明中谈的是正确地理解马克思列宁主义的学说，谈到意识形态性质的问题。马克思列宁主义学说是国际工人运动的旗帜。因此，当两国共产党代表会晤的时候，他们表示忠于革命的意识形态——马克思列宁主义，这是很自然的。
    谈到最高级会议的时候，赫鲁晓夫说，在我们看来，最高级会议在最近两月内举行是可能的。这是在这种意义上说的，那就是现在有着举行高级会晤交换意见的一切根据。需要的是一切可能参加最高级会议的国家政府的愿望和诚意。但看来这个会议在最近两个月之内是开不成了。西方国家、特别是美国的领导人想尽可能地拖延最高级会议。总之给人这样一种印象：他们甚至不愿意举行这种会议。
    反对举行高级会议的人为了想埋葬高级会议主张本身，就扬言要很好地筹备会议，借以把会议问题的解决引入舌战的迷宫。他们口头上表示愿意参加会议，实际上是在混淆视听，企图首先拖延会议，然后施展某种手段搞得局势紧张起来，以便在冠冕堂皇的借口下破坏会议，并继续“冷战”。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在公众正在对本国的政府施加强大的压力。舆论对政府的压力越大，举行高级会见的信心就越强。可以作出决定以有利于世界和平的那些问题，已经成熟了。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，我们愿意同意大利人民、同意大利政府保持最良好的关系。然而遗憾的是，意大利政府现在实行的是妨碍我们两国建立友好关系的政策。但是随着时间的前进，情况是会改变的。我们相信，如果不是现在，那么在不久的将来我们两国会建立起良好的关系。这样对苏联和对意大利都是有好处的。
