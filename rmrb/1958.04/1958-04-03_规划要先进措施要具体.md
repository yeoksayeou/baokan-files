    Planning Must Be Advanced, Measures Must Be Concrete
    Qian Yin
    Since the task of developing local industry was proposed, enthusiasm has been high in various places. Many places have put forward plans for one year of preparation, three years of great change, and five years to surpass the total output value of agriculture. A revolutionary spirit of moving mountains and lifting tripods has appeared everywhere. But it cannot stop there. There must be concrete measures to guarantee that the grand blueprints on paper can be turned into reality.
    At present, the situation has emerged where people feel that once the great leap forward plan is made and the advanced targets are set, the great achievement is already accomplished. There are also some people who, in their view, planning is a matter of three to five years, and there is plenty of time in the future, so there is no need to rush, and therefore they are slow to grasp measures. People with the above ideas have a common characteristic, that is, they only grasp planning, and do not grasp or grasp few measures. Obviously, this is an incorrect idea.
    A thorough revolutionary must have both lofty ideals and a spirit of hard work and practical work. A plan represents our ideal for a period of time, and grasping measures and methods to work hard and practically is the decisive step to realize the ideal. Planning and measures are originally twin brothers. At the same time as a plan is put forward, strong measures must follow accordingly. The idea of only managing planning and not managing or managing few measures will inevitably make the plan empty talk. Any plan, once it becomes empty talk, will lose its advanced meaning. Chairman Mao said: "We must not only put forward tasks, but also solve the problem of methods to complete the tasks. Our task is to cross the river, but we cannot cross without a bridge or a boat. If we do not solve the problem of the bridge or the boat, crossing the river is empty talk. Without solving the problem of method, the task is just a lot of nonsense." Isn't the plan that only mentions indicators but does not care about specific measures, as Chairman Mao said, "empty talk" and "a lot of nonsense"!
    Yes, planning is a matter for the future, a matter of one or two years, three or five years. The idea of trying to complete everything in a short period of time is of course unrealistic. However, precisely because planning is the goal to be achieved in the future, if we do not grasp and rush now, and do not come up with specific methods to gradually realize it, it is possible that: time has passed, the plan is still on paper, or the goals in the plan are not achieved. It should be said that to vigorously develop local industry, there are many problems. Where does the money come from for funds? How to spend the money when you have it? Where do the equipment come from? Where to find skilled technicians? How to arrange raw materials and sales markets? And so on, there must be measures. Precisely because there are so many problems, then starting early, thinking about measures and methods in more detail, is of greater significance.
    In a few years, making the total output value of local industry surpass agriculture is a major event that can mobilize the masses and inspire the people. However, the plan for developing local industry only puts forward the direction and indicators, and it is still necessary to strengthen subjective efforts to truly solve specific problems. Of course, coming up with strong measures may be more difficult than formulating a plan. Although things are difficult, as long as we adopt the method of the mass line, we can still find ways to overcome difficulties. In this regard, the specific measures proposed by Beijing to realize the industrialization of districts and townships have provided us with a good example.

    规划要先进措施要具体
    千音
    自从提出发展地方工业的任务以来，各地的积极性很高。不少地方提出了一年准备，三年大变，五年赶过农业总产值的规划，到处出现了拔山举鼎的革命气魄。但是不能到此为止。必须要有具体措施作保证，纸上的宏图大略才能变为现实。
    目前已出现这种情况，觉得跃进的规划作出来了，前进的指标也有了，大功即已告成。还有一些人，在他们看来，规划是三年五载的事情，来日方长，可以慢慢来不用着急，因而迟迟不抓措施。具有上述思想的人，他们有个共同的特点，就是只抓规划，不抓或少抓措施。显然这是一种不正确的想法。
    彻底的革命派，既要有远大的理想，又要有苦干实干的精神。一个规划，代表我们一个时期的理想，而抓措施抓办法去苦干实干，则是实现理想的决定性的步骤。规划和措施本来是一对孪生子，在提出规划的同时，有力的措施必须相应地跟上。那种只管规划，不管或少管措施的想法，其结果必然会使规划形成空谈。任何规划，一旦成为空谈，它就会失去先进的意义了。毛主席说：“我们不但要提出任务，而且要解决完成任务的方法问题。我们的任务是过河，但是没有桥或没有船就不能过，不解决桥或船的问题，过河就是一句空话。不解决方法问题，任务也只是瞎说一顿。”那种只管提指标不管具体措施的规划，不正如毛主席所说的是“一句空话”“瞎说一顿”吗！
    是的，规划是将来的事情，是一年两年、三年五载的事情，那种企图在短短的时间内办完一切的想法，当然是不切实际的。但是，正由于规划是将来要达到的目标，如果当前不抓不赶，不拿出具体办法来逐步实现它，有可能是：时间过去了，规划仍然停留在纸上，或者达不到规划中的目标。应当说，要大力发展地方工业，问题是不少的。要资金，钱从哪里来；有了钱怎么花法；设备从那儿来，熟练的技术工人到哪里去找；原材料和销售市场如何安排。如此等等，都要有措施。正由于有这么多的问题，那末及早动手，措施和办法想得具体一些，就更有重要的意义了。
    数年内，使地方工业的总产值赶过农业，这是一件很能动员群众，鼓舞人心的大事。但是，发展地方工业的规划，只是提出了方向和指标，还必须加强主观努力切切实实解决具体问题。当然，拿出有力的措施来，很可能比制定规划还要难一些。事情虽难，只要我们采取群众路线的方法，还是可以找到克服困难的办法的。在这方面，北京市提出的实现区乡工业化的具体措施，已经为我们提供了一个很好的例子。
