    Party Newspaper Reports Should Be Accurate and Reliable
    The People's Daily is the newspaper of the Party and the people, and should possess a high degree of principle and seriousness. All news reports should be based on facts, accurate, and reliable. However, in the January 24th report this year regarding Chen Xianwen's successful trial production of a new type of radio, the editors and reporters of the People's Daily violated the above principles, exaggerating what was actually a crystal radio into a new type of radio different from a crystal radio.
    This kind of exaggerated reporting has brought about undesirable consequences. It has caused many radio enthusiasts across the country to raise questions and inquire about the specific details of this radio from various sources, adding a lot of trouble to the relevant units. After readers understood the actual situation, they were dissatisfied with this report.
    The crystal radio successfully trial-produced by Comrade Chen Xianwen is indeed better than ordinary crystal radios, with a louder sound. The People's Daily could have reported on it, but it should not have exaggerated the facts. From this short report, it is not difficult to see that the editors and reporters who wrote this news item for the People's Daily do not have extensive enough industrial knowledge and should continue to study hard.

### 党报的报道应准确可靠

    党报的报道应准确可靠
    人民日报是党和人民的报纸，应当具有高度的原则性和严肃性，一切消息报道应该实事求是、准确可靠。但是在今年1月24日关于陈宪文试制成功一种新式收音机的报道中，人民日报的编辑和记者，竟违背了上述原则，把实际是一种矿石收音机渲染夸大为不同于矿石收音机的新式收音机。
    这种夸大事实的报道，带来的后果是不好的，结果引起全国许多无线电爱好者的疑问，向各方面探询这种收音机的具体情况，给有关单位增加很多麻烦。当读者了解了这个实际情况后，对这篇报道是不满意的。
    陈宪文同志试制成功的矿石收音机确比一般矿石机好，声音大，人民日报可以报道，但是不应该夸大事实。从这篇短短的报道中，不难看出人民日报编写这条消息的编辑和记者的工业知识不够广泛，应该继续努力学习。
