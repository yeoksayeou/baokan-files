Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, April 11th. The Xuhuai area spring plowing production inspection team organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is conducting technical guidance while inspecting, solving problems in production on the spot.

The inspection team is led by Gu Fusheng, Director of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute. The inspection team includes experts in wheat, sweet potato, rice, animal husbandry, plant protection and other aspects. They inspected the wheat growth in the suburbs of Xuzhou City and Tongshan County. Now wheat has generally jointed and is growing very well. Wheat field management is better than any previous year. Spring plowing and spring sowing are also advancing rapidly, and the masses have great enthusiasm. However, some agricultural cooperatives have not taken enough measures to increase production. During the inspection at the Poli Agricultural Cooperative and Huaguang Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Xuzhou City, the inspection team found that underground pests such as grubs, mole crickets, and wireworms were relatively serious. The experts carefully inspected the degree of pest damage. They found three or four wireworms in a foot of wheat row, with a high density. More than 10% of the wheat seedlings in some wheat fields had been bitten. Wheat spiders have also become very active. The most wheat spiders on each wheat leaf are more than a dozen, and the general ones are five or six, and wheat aphids have also been found. The experts immediately put forward ways and specific measures to eliminate these pests, and jointly studied with the agricultural cooperatives how to pass three passes in the more than fifty days before the wheat harvest. Detailed methods were also proposed for frost and drought prevention.

Individual high-yield wheat fields look good from a distance, but when the experts carefully inspected them, they found that the wheat seedlings were growing excessively and the wheat stalks were thin and soft due to excessive application of human manure and urine, and there was already lodging. Jin Shanbao, a wheat expert and President of Nanjing Agricultural College, suggested that some of the top leaves should be removed to make the wheat fields ventilated and transparent. He started to tear off the wheat leaves and explained the benefits of doing so to the cooperative cadres. He said: If you don't remove these leaves now, it will affect the harvest. Don't feel sorry for it.

The inspection team also inspected the sweet potato warm beds. During the inspection, sweet potato expert Zhang Bitai found that some warm beds had too thick soil cover, and some warm beds had too low temperatures, which affected seedling emergence. In some warm beds, no grass was covered or too little was covered, and measures to improve seedling bed management were promptly proposed to the agricultural cooperatives. Tongshan County also invited Zhang Bitai to give a scientific and technical report on sweet potato cultivation to all the cadres who had been sent down. The inspection team also jointly studied with the agricultural cooperatives how to arrange winter crops in areas where there are too many late autumn stubbles this year.

The situation discovered by the inspection team has attracted the attention of the local Party committee and agricultural cooperatives. The Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency meeting that night to study measures to eliminate pests, and the agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs have taken action overnight.

    江苏农业专家检查春耕
    深入田间　指导技术　很受欢迎
    新华社徐州11日电　中共江苏省委组织的徐淮地区春耕生产检查团，边检查边进行技术指导，就地解决生产中的问题。
    检查团由华东农业科学研究所所长顾复生率领。参加检查团的有小麦、甘薯、水稻、畜牧、植物保护等各方面的专家。他们在徐州市郊区和铜山县检查了小麦生长情况。现在小麦已普遍拔节，生长十分良好。麦田管理胜过以往任何一年。春耕春种也正在迅速推进，群众干劲很大。但有些农业社抓增产措施不够。在徐州市郊区坡里农业社和华光农业社检查时，检查团发现蛴螬、蝼蛄、金针虫等地下虫害比较严重。专家们仔细地检查了虫害的危害程度，在一尺麦行中，找到金针虫三、四个，密度较大，有的麦田已有10％以上的麦苗被咬。麦蜘蛛也已大量活动，每片麦叶最多的有麦蜘蛛十多个，一般的也有五、六个，还发现了麦蚜虫。专家们当场提出了消灭这些虫害的办法和具体措施，并且和农业社共同研究了在麦收前五十多天的时间内，如何过三关的问题。在防霜冻、防春旱方面也提出了详细办法。
    个别小麦丰产田远看长得很好，但专家们仔细检查时，发现由于追施人粪尿过多，麦苗徒长，麦秆细软，已有倒伏现象。小麦专家、南京农学院院长金善宝提出应把顶部的叶子扯掉一些，使麦田通风透光。他一面动手扯麦叶，一面向社干部解释这样做的好处。他说：现在不打掉这些叶子，要影响丰收，不要觉得可惜。
    检查团对甘薯温床也作了检查。甘薯专家张必泰在检查中发现有些温床复土太厚，有些温床温度过低，影响出苗。有的温床上面没有盖草或盖得太少，都及时向农业社提出改进苗床管理的措施。铜山县并邀请张必泰对全体下放干部作甘薯栽培的科学技术报告。检查团还和农业社共同研究了今年晚秋茬过多的地方，冬季作物如何布局的问题。
    检查团发现的情况，已引起当地党委和农业社的重视。中共徐州市委当晚召开紧急会议，研究消灭虫害的措施，郊区各农业社已连夜行动起来。
