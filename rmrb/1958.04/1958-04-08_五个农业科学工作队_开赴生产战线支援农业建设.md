Five Agricultural Science Teams
Set Off for the Production Front to Support Agricultural Construction

(Our Newspaper News) Five scientific work teams dispatched by the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, consisting of 198 agricultural scientists, departed from Beijing in batches from the 4th to the 7th, heading to rural areas to support agricultural production. Before their departure, they held a mobilization meeting and unanimously passed a covenant, expressing their determination to wholeheartedly serve the great leap forward in agricultural production.

The Academy of Agricultural Sciences plans to send six scientific work teams to work on the agricultural production front this year. The teams that have already departed include the Scientific Work Team for Investigating and Summarizing High-Yield and Abundant Production Experiences, the Comprehensive Scientific Work Team for Low-Yield Areas, the Comprehensive Scientific Work Team for Mountainous Area Production, the Scientific Work Team for Plant Disease and Pest Control, and the Scientific Work Team for Livestock and Poultry Breeding and Epidemic Prevention. Another Scientific Work Team for Agricultural Machinery and Tool Improvement is currently participating in the work of the upcoming Agricultural Machinery Exhibition. In addition to personnel from various research institutes in Beijing, the five work teams that have already departed also include 55 scientists from various directly affiliated specialized institutes of the Academy of Agricultural Sciences located in other parts of the country. Their main task after arriving in rural areas is to support local efforts to improve agricultural production this year, while also investigating and researching how to further promote the leap forward in agricultural production in the future. The work team going to high-yield areas will summarize abundant production experiences; the two work teams going to low-yield and mountainous areas will investigate and summarize high-yield experiences in low-yield areas. The disease and pest control team will study methods for preventing and controlling diseases and pests of summer-harvested crops and major autumn-harvested crops this year. The livestock and poultry breeding and epidemic prevention team will help local areas find ways to eliminate and prevent infectious diseases, as well as study the utilization of feed, and so on.

The work of each agricultural science work team will be regularly inspected and evaluated, and at the end of the year, they will also write research reports that are accurate, clear, vivid, and scientific.

    五个农业科学工作队
    开赴生产战线支援农业建设
    本报讯　中国农业科学院派出的五个科学工作队，其中一百九十八个农业科学工作者从4日到7日已经分批从北京出发，分赴各地农村支援农业生产。出发前，他们曾举行誓师大会，并一致通过了一个公约，表示要坚决做到全心全意为农业生产大跃进服务。
    农业科学院今年要派出六个科学工作队到农业生产战线上工作。已经出发的工作队有高额丰产经验调查总结科学工作队、低产区综合科学工作队、山区生产综合科学工作队、植物病虫害防治科学工作队、家畜家禽饲养和防疫科学工作队。另一个农业机器及农具改进科学工作队正参加即将举行的农业机具展览会的工作。已出发的五个工作队，除北京各研究所的人员外，还有农业科学院在外地的直属各专业所的五十五个科学工作者参加。他们到农村后的主要工作，是支援各地搞好今年的农业生产，同时调查研究各地农业生产今后如何进一步跃进的问题。到高产区的工作队将总结丰产经验；到低产区和山区去的两个工作队将调查总结在低产区里的高产经验。病虫害防治队将研究今年夏收作物和主要秋收作物病虫害的防治方法。家畜家禽饲养和防疫队将帮助各地设法扑灭和预防传染病，以及研究饲料的利用问题等。
    各农业科学工作队工作中将随时进行检查和评比，年终还要写出具有准确性、鲜明性、生动性、科学性的研究报告。
