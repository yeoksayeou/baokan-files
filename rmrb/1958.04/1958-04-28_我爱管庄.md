    I Love Guanzhuang
    Technician at the Cement Design Institute, Zheng Zhiquan
    I am a young man in my twenties. In the past, in Guanzhuang, an environment with an extremely weak political atmosphere, I had become a listless "little old man." Some of the young technicians here, including myself, would stare at a design board of one square meter while at work, thinking about who was dressed well, who had a high salary, and how to diligently study technology, to "specialize" and become an engineer with a high salary in the future. After work, we would talk about which female comrade was pretty, and who was dating whom. If there was some voluntary labor to be done in our spare time, people would complain: probably the administration can't afford laborers, so they want us to do this kind of work. Occasionally working overtime, we also felt we should get overtime pay. A saying was popular here: "Money can't buy Saturday, Sunday is the hardest to bear." Because on Saturday nights you could dance, but on Sundays you could only sleep. National interests, collective interests, socialist construction, all were forgotten. No one was interested in political theory study. In our section, out of thirty-five Youth League members, only the section chief subscribed to "China Youth."
    The newspaper's criticism of Guanzhuang as a "free kingdom" was like a blow to the head for us young technicians. It told us that if we continued like this, it would not only ruin this part of the country's work, but also ruin ourselves. Most of us young technical personnel have awakened. After study, criticism, and struggle, everyone realized the importance of "redness," and the significance of politics as the commander. Almost everyone bought the Young Communist League Series, "China Youth," "Red Flag Fluttering," "On Being Both Red and Expert" and other books and periodicals. Everyone scrambled to participate in various voluntary labor activities, whether it was repairing water conservancy, fighting drought, or planting trees. At work, everyone was tense and happy, full of energy. Back in the dormitory, we also talked about ideology, work, and the situation of the Great Leap Forward nationwide.
    People's thoughts and feelings are changing, and the entire Guanzhuang is also changing. The most significant change is that social order is very stable. The atmosphere of theft has been swept away. In the past, every time you took a bath, you had to be nervous; good clothes and leather shoes had to be changed. You also had to be vigilant enough when bathing, or you might lose all your clothes and not be able to get out. Now it's really different. If you lose something inside, the attendant will keep it safe for you. The appearance of Guanzhuang is also changing. Piles of garbage have been cleared, everything is cleaned up, and there are flowers, plants, and trees everywhere. Now everyone and every piece of land here feels particularly lovely. Guanzhuang, I deeply love you. I am willing to work in your embrace forever, and contribute all my strength to the socialist cement design cause.

    我爱管庄
    水泥设计院技术员　郑智全
    我是一个二十多岁的年轻人，过去在管庄那样一个政治空气极端薄弱的环境下，也成为暮气沉沉的“小老头”。这里的一些年青技术员，包括我在内，上了班，眼睛瞪着一块设计用的一平方公尺大的图板，脑子里想着谁穿得好，谁待遇高，怎样好好钻研技术，“专”一下，将来当工程师，拿高工资。下班回来，谈谈那个女同志长得漂亮，某人和某人谈恋爱。要在业余时间进行一些义务劳动，有人就反映：大约是行政上雇不起小工，所以要我们干这种活。偶而加一次班，也觉得应该领加班费才对。这里流行着一句话：“有钱难买礼拜六，星期天最难受。”因为星期六晚上可以跳跳舞，星期天只好睡大觉。什么国家利益，集体利益，社会主义建设，全都置之脑后，政治理论学习谁都没有兴趣，我们科内三十五个团员，只有科长一个人订着“中国青年”。
    报纸对管庄“自由王国”的批评，不啻是对我们这些青年技术员一声当头棒喝。它告诉我们，这样下去，不但会毁了国家的这部分事业，也会毁了我们自己。我们大多数青年技术人员都猛醒过来了。经过学习、批判和斗争，大家认识到“红”的重要，认识到政治是统帅的意义。差不多每人都买了青年共产主义者丛刊，“中国青年”、“红旗飘飘”、“论又红又专”等书刊。各种义务劳动无论是修水利、抗旱或是植树，大家都争先恐后地参加。上班时，人人紧张愉快，干劲十足，回到宿舍也是谈思想、谈工作，谈全国大跃进的形势。
    人们的思想感情变化着，整个管庄也变化着。最显著的是社会秩序非常安定。盗窃的风气为之一扫。从前洗一次澡，就要紧张一次好的衣服、皮鞋也得换下来。洗澡的时候，还要有足够的警惕，弄不好就有衣服丢光走不出来的危险。现在真是大不相同了，丢了什么东西在里边，服务员也会替你保管得好好的。管庄的外貌也在变化，成堆的垃圾清除了，到处都打扫得干干净净，到处是花草树木。现在这里的每一个人、每一片场地都觉得特别可爱。管庄，我深深地爱着你，我愿意永远在你的怀抱里工作，把我的全部力量贡献给社会主义的水泥设计事业。
