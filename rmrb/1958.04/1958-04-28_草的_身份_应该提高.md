    The "Status" of Grass Should Be Elevated
    Cheng Pu
    In agricultural activities, a certain position should be given to planting grass. The "status" of grass should be elevated.
    When planting grass is mentioned, some people may not be interested. They will say: Grain, cotton, oil crops, sugar crops, hemp, vegetables, trees, etc., are necessities for people's economic life, and the more these things are planted, the better. But what is the point of planting grass? These people do not understand that grass also has its value and use, and we must not underestimate it. Weeds growing in farmland bully crops and are harmful, and farmers must resolutely eradicate them. However, some grasses are not only not harmful but are also treasures. Even those weeds that bully crops become beneficial to people if they grow on barren mountains and in deserts.
    So, what are the benefits of planting grass?
    Planting grass can conserve water and soil. In high and arid regions, such as Northwest China, there are large areas of dry slopes with severe soil erosion, and crop yields are very low. Some barren steep slopes not only do not grow crops, but even planting trees is not easy to succeed. The best way to utilize this type of land is to plant drought-resistant pasture, allowing the grass to cover the ground and protect the surface. Because the stems and leaves of grass can intercept some rainwater, reducing surface runoff (the part of rainwater that flows directly from the ground). The roots of the grass can absorb and conserve moisture, preventing soil erosion. In recent years, many soil erosion areas in Gansu and Shaanxi have planted a large amount of pasture with good water and soil conservation effects—sweet clover. According to the test data from the Tianshui Soil and Water Conservation Scientific Experiment Station from 1954 to 1956, rotating sweet clover with crops reduced surface runoff by 60.8% to 69.7% and soil erosion by 64.9% to 66.8% compared to other fields. With the improvement of soil and water conservation, further utilization of the land for planting other crops guarantees increased production.
    Planting grass can fix sand. In the northern part of Northwest China, the western part of Northeast China, the northwestern part of North China, and the Inner Mongolia region, there are vast areas of deserts and sandy land. In these areas, sand dunes are constantly moving, swallowing up fertile fields and villages. To stop the attack of wind and sand, we must first fix and seal off the sand dunes. Planting trees and grass is a powerful measure to combat shifting sands. Farmers in Jingbian County, northern Shaanxi, transplanted a perennial wild grass called sand sagebrush from the beach to the shifting sand dunes, fixing and leveling the sand dunes. Sand bamboo, sand rice, and other plants grew in the middle of the sand sagebrush, and the appearance of the beach slowly changed.
    Planting grass can improve the soil and increase farmland harvest. Because the grass growing on the ground can conserve water and soil, and the decayed grass can increase the organic matter in the soil, the combination of these two effects can continuously improve the barren soil. There are also some grasses, such as alfalfa and sweet clover, which belong to the legume family. Their roots have rhizobia, which can continuously absorb and fix nitrogen from the air, making them natural nitrogen fertilizer processing plants. In some farmland with very poor soil fertility, using this type of pasture and crop rotation can more effectively improve soil fertility and greatly increase farmland harvest. In many places in the Tianshui Special Zone of Gansu, plowing and planting wheat two years after planting sweet clover doubled the wheat yield. After planting one crop of sweet clover, the soil fertility can be maintained for two or three years. In Qinling Township, Tianshui County, there were four mu of steep slope land, which used to yield only one stone and one dou of wheat per mu. After rotating with sweet clover, each mu yielded three stones and nine dou of wheat, an increase of more than two and a half times. The Qijiazi Soil and Water Conservation Experiment Station in Fuxin County, Liaoning Province, adopted intercropping of purple alfalfa and sorghum in 1956 (strip intercropping of grass and farmland), producing 2,755 jin of sorghum per hectare, an increase of 89.9% compared to the single cropping of sorghum on the same level of land in the same year, and also yielded an additional 3,000 jin of green grass (alfalfa). In 1957, this station planted sorghum on the stubble of alfalfa, and the yield increased by another 45.8%.
    This fact shows how important planting grass is for the rational utilization and improvement of arable land. In mountainous and sandy areas, there are many farmlands with very poor soil quality. It is a pity to abandon this kind of farmland, but the yield of planting crops is extremely low, and sometimes even a small disaster will not recover the seeds. Some farmers adopt the method of "extensive planting and low harvest," and simply abandon some thin land after planting crops for three or two years. The large amount of abandoned land that exists in various places has been produced in this way. However, abandoning arable land is not a positive method after all. Because even such barren land, if used rationally, can bring us benefits. How to use it? The best way is to use lean land to plant pasture first, or to implement grass-field intercropping or rotation as discussed above. Shanxi Province has decided to implement a "basic farmland" system in mountainous areas with sparse population this year, designating better arable land as "basic farmland" that must be cultivated intensively, and plan to return some arable land that is not suitable for planting crops to pasture and trees, so that no land is left idle. In this way, on the one hand, the total output of crops can be increased due to fine land processing, and on the other hand, those bad lands are rationally utilized, and after several years, these bad lands will also become good lands.
    Planting grass can expand and improve pastures. Natural grasslands are often subject to soil erosion due to overgrazing, hindering grassland renewal and affecting the development of animal husbandry. Therefore, some pastures need to implement mountain closure and gully closure to cultivate grass for a certain period of time, and pasture can be replanted in places lacking grass. Some barren slopes and gullies that are not suitable for cultivation can become new pastures by planting pasture.
    In some mountainous areas in the north, the land is barren, and "three materials" (fuel, feed, fertilizer) are lacking. Planting grass is one of the most effective ways to change this unfavorable situation. Pasture such as sweet clover and purple alfalfa are nutritious livestock feed. These pastures can also be composted. Dry grass can be burned as firewood. The Wujiapan Agricultural Cooperative in Suide County, Shaanxi Province, had 24 draught animals in 1955 and spent 860 yuan to buy forage. In 1956 and 1957, sweet clover was planted, and a large amount of green grass was harvested. In these two years, the number of livestock increased by more than half, and there was a large surplus of forage. In 1957, this cooperative also harvested more than 97,000 jin of dry grass, which was enough to supply each member of the cooperative with three months of firewood. Last year, Suide County used sweet clover to compost more than 1.25 million jin of fertilizer.
    In short, planting grass is a win-win situation and is well worth promoting. Especially in the north, where there are many barren mountains and bald ridges, and many sandy wastelands, more grass should be planted.
    There are many types of grass in my country that can be used as feed and green manure. It is necessary for various places to choose and promote what kind of grass is suitable for planting in what place. Common pastures in the north include alfalfa, sweet clover, and crowfoot grass, etc., and in the south, there are sesbania, flax, and crotalaria, etc. The sweet clover mentioned repeatedly above is a good grass that deserves special attention. It has many advantages: strong adaptability, drought resistance, cold resistance, and salt-alkali resistance; labor-saving planting, and it can be planted in all seasons; it has a great effect on soil and water conservation, grows fast, and has a high yield; it has high nutritional value. The use of sweet clover is not only for "three materials." Its seeds can also be used for oil extraction, brewing, vinegar making, and flour making, and its straw can be peeled for fiber to make ropes. Sweet clover is also a good honey source plant. Some farmers in the Tianshui area of Gansu raise bees in places where sweet clover is planted, and the honey yield is high and the quality is good. Because sweet clover has so many uses, farmers in Gansu call it treasure grass. The reputation of treasure grass is spreading wider and wider, and this year 18 provinces and cities across the country will promote sweet clover. Not long ago, it was just a wild grass growing on the Loess Plateau, but now its value has greatly exceeded that of ordinary pastures. It is not an exaggeration to even call it an economic crop. Are not the various crops we are now planting selected and cultivated by our ancestors from wild grasses thousands of years ago? In the era of the great leap forward in agriculture, wild grasses that can be turned into economic crops are definitely more than just sweet clover. Now, thousands of valuable wild plants have been investigated in various parts of the country. Who can arbitrarily say that several new crops will not be produced from so many wild plants?

    草的“身份”应该提高
    程浦
    在农业活动上，应当给种草以一定的地位。草的
  “身份”应当提高。
    提起种草，有些人可能不感兴趣。他们会说：粮食、棉花、油料、糖料、麻、菜、树等等，是人们经济生活所必需的，这些东西种得越多越好。可是种草有什么意思呢？这些人不了解，草也有它的价值和用处，我们决不可以轻视它。杂草生在庄稼地里，欺负庄稼，那是害物，农民要坚决铲除它们。但是，有些草不但不是害物，而且是宝贝。就是那些欺负庄稼的杂草，如果长在荒山上和沙漠里，也就成了对人们有益的东西。
    那末，种草到底有哪些好处呢？
    种草可以保持水土。在高旱地区，如我国西北，有大量干旱的坡地，水土流失极严重，种庄稼收成很低。有些瘠薄的陡坡不但不长庄稼，连种树也不容易成活。利用这类土地的最好的办法，就是种耐旱的牧草，让草复盖地面，保护地面。因为草的茎叶可以拦截一部分雨水，减少地面的径流（就是雨水直接从地面流走的部分）。草的根部可以吸收并保蓄水分，防止土壤冲刷。近几年来，甘肃和陕西的许多水土流失地区都大量种植了一种具有良好的保持水土作用的牧草——草木樨。根据天水水土保持科学试验站的1954—1956年测验资料，草木樨与农作物轮作，比别的田减少地表径流60.8％——69.7％，减少土壤冲刷量64.9％——66.8％。土地的水土保持状况改善了，再进一步利用土地种别的农作物，增产就有保证了。
    种草可以固沙。在我国西北地区的北部、东北地区的西部、华北地区的西北部和内蒙古地区，都有广大的沙漠和沙丘地带。在这些地区，沙丘不断移动，吞没良田和村庄市镇。要阻止风沙的袭击，首先得把沙丘固定和封锁起来。种树和种草就是同流沙作斗争的有力措施。陕北靖边县农民把沙滩上的一种叫作沙蒿的多年生的野草移植在流动沙丘上，就把沙丘固定了，拉平了，在沙蒿中间长起了沙竹、沙米、?草等植物，沙滩的面貌慢慢地也就改变了。
    种草可以改良土壤，提高农田收获量。因为长在地上的草能保持水土，草腐烂了，又能增加土壤里的有机成分，这两方面的作用加在一起，就能够不断地改良瘠薄的土壤。还有一些草，像苜蓿、草木樨，属于豆科植物，它们的根部有根瘤菌，可以不断地吸取并固定空气中的氮素，可以说是氮肥的天然加工厂。在一些土壤肥力很差的农田上，用这类牧草和农作物轮作，可以更有效地提高土地的肥力，大大增加农田的收获量。甘肃天水专区的许多地方，种植草木樨二年后，翻耕种小麦，小麦增产一倍。种过一茬草木樨，土地肥力可以维持二、三年。天水县秦岭乡有四亩陡坡地，过去每亩只收小麦一石一斗，用草木樨轮作后，每亩收小麦三石九斗，增产两倍半多。辽宁省阜新县七家子水土保持试验站1956年采用紫花苜蓿和高粱间作（草田带状间作），每公顷产高粱二千七百五十五斤，比当年同级土地单作高粱增产89.9％，还额外收了三千斤青草（苜蓿）。1957年这个站在苜蓿的下茬地上种高粱，又增产45.8％。
    这个事实说明，种草对于合理利用和改良耕地有着多么大的意义。在山区和风沙地区有很多土质很差的耕地，这种耕地弃之可惜，种庄稼又产量极低，有时遇上一点小灾，连种子也收不回来。有些农民采取“广种薄收”的办法，在一些薄地种上三两年庄稼以后，干脆把它扔掉。各地现有的大量的弃耕地，就是这样产生的。但是，把耕地扔掉，毕竟不是积极的办法。因为就是这样瘠薄的地，利用得合理，也是可以给我们带来收益的。怎样利用呢？最好的办法，就是利用瘦地先种牧草，或者像上面谈的那样，实行草田间作或轮作。山西省决定今年在地广人稀的山区，实行“基本农田”制度，把较好的耕地定为必须精耕细作的“基本农田”，把一部分不适宜种农作物的耕地，有计划地退耕，种牧草，栽树，作到不闲置一分地。这样，一方面农作物的总产量可以因精细的土地加工而增加，另方面又合理利用了那些坏地，而且经过若干年，这些坏地也将变成好地。
    种草可以扩大和改良牧场。天然草地常因过度放牧引起土壤冲刷，妨碍草地更新，影响畜牧业的发展。因此有些牧场需要在一定时期实行封山封沟育草，在缺草的地方可以补种上牧草。有些不适于耕种的荒坡荒沟，种上牧草，就成了新的牧场。
    北方有些山区，土地瘠瘦，“三料”
  （燃料、饲料、肥料）俱缺。种草是改变这种不利局面的最有效途径之一。像草木樨、紫花苜蓿等牧草，都是营养丰富的牲畜饲料。这些牧草还可以沤粪。干草可以当柴烧。陕西绥德县吴家畔农业社1955年有二十四头耕畜，花了八百六十元买饲草。1956年和1957年种草木樨，收了大量青草，这两年牲口净增一半以上，饲草还有大量剩余。这个社1957年还收干草九万七千多斤，光这些干草就足够供给全社每户社员三个月的烧柴。绥德县去年用草木樨沤肥一百二十五万多斤。
    总之，种草是一举数得的事情，很值得加以提倡。特别是北方，荒山秃岭多，沙荒多，应该更多地种草。
    我国可以用作饲料和绿肥的草的种类很多，什么地方适合种什么草，需要各地自己选择和推广。北方常见的牧草有苜蓿、草木樨、鸡脚草等等，南方有田菁、柽麻、猪屎豆等等。上面屡次提到的草木樨，更是值得特别重视的一种好草。它的优点很多：适应力强，耐旱，耐寒，耐盐碱；种植省工，而且一年四季都可以种；水土保持作用大，生长快，产量高；营养价值高。草木樨的用途不光是作“三料”，它的种籽还可以榨油、酿酒、制醋、制粉，它的秸秆可以剥出纤维打绳。草木樨还是一种很好的蜜源植物。甘肃天水地区有些农民在种草木樨的地方养蜂，蜂蜜产量高，质量也好。正因为草木樨有这么多的用处，所以甘肃农民叫它是宝贝草。宝贝草的声誉越传越广，今年全国十八个省市都要推广草木樨了。不久以前还只是生长在黄土高原上的一种野草，现在它的身价已经大大超过了一般牧草。甚至把它叫作经济作物，也不算过分。我们现在种植的各种农作物，难道不就是我们的祖先在几千年前从野草中选择培育出来的吗？在农业大跃进的时代，可以变成经济作物的野草，决不止草木樨一种。现在全国各地已经调查出千百种有价值的野生植物，谁能武断说这么多野生植物中不会产生出若干种新的农作物呢？
