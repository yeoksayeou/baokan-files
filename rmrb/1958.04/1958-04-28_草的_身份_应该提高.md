    The "Status" of Grass Should Be Elevated
    Cheng Pu
    In agricultural activities, a certain position should be given to planting grass. The "status" of grass should be elevated.
    When planting grass is mentioned, some people may not be interested. They will say: Grain, cotton, oil crops, sugar crops, hemp, vegetables, trees, etc., are necessities for people's economic life, and the more these things are planted, the better. But what is the point of planting grass? These people do not understand that grass also has its value and use, and we must not underestimate it. Weeds growing in farmland bully crops and are harmful, and farmers must resolutely eradicate them. However, some grasses are not only not harmful but are also treasures. Even those weeds that bully crops become beneficial to people if they grow on barren mountains and in deserts.
    So, what are the benefits of planting grass?
    Planting grass can conserve water and soil. In high and arid regions, such as Northwest China, there are large areas of dry slopes with severe soil erosion, and crop yields are very low. Some barren steep slopes not only do not grow crops, but even planting trees is not easy to succeed. The best way to utilize this type of land is to plant drought-resistant pasture, allowing the grass to cover the ground and protect the surface. Because the stems and leaves of grass can intercept some rainwater, reducing surface runoff (the part of rainwater that flows directly from the ground). The roots of the grass can absorb and conserve moisture, preventing soil erosion. In recent years, many soil erosion areas in Gansu and Shaanxi have planted a large amount of pasture with good water and soil conservation effects‚Äîsweet clover. According to the test data from the Tianshui Soil and Water Conservation Scientific Experiment Station from 1954 to 1956, rotating sweet clover with crops reduced surface runoff by 60.8% to 69.7% and soil erosion by 64.9% to 66.8% compared to other fields. With the improvement of soil and water conservation, further utilization of the land for planting other crops guarantees increased production.
    Planting grass can fix sand. In the northern part of Northwest China, the western part of Northeast China, the northwestern part of North China, and the Inner Mongolia region, there are vast areas of deserts and sandy land. In these areas, sand dunes are constantly moving, swallowing up fertile fields and villages. To stop the attack of wind and sand, we must first fix and seal off the sand dunes. Planting trees and grass is a powerful measure to combat shifting sands. Farmers in Jingbian County, northern Shaanxi, transplanted a perennial wild grass called sand sagebrush from the beach to the shifting sand dunes, fixing and leveling the sand dunes. Sand bamboo, sand rice, and other plants grew in the middle of the sand sagebrush, and the appearance of the beach slowly changed.
    Planting grass can improve the soil and increase farmland harvest. Because the grass growing on the ground can conserve water and soil, and the decayed grass can increase the organic matter in the soil, the combination of these two effects can continuously improve the barren soil. There are also some grasses, such as alfalfa and sweet clover, which belong to the legume family. Their roots have rhizobia, which can continuously absorb and fix nitrogen from the air, making them natural nitrogen fertilizer processing plants. In some farmland with very poor soil fertility, using this type of pasture and crop rotation can more effectively improve soil fertility and greatly increase farmland harvest. In many places in the Tianshui Special Zone of Gansu, plowing and planting wheat two years after planting sweet clover doubled the wheat yield. After planting one crop of sweet clover, the soil fertility can be maintained for two or three years. In Qinling Township, Tianshui County, there were four mu of steep slope land, which used to yield only one stone and one dou of wheat per mu. After rotating with sweet clover, each mu yielded three stones and nine dou of wheat, an increase of more than two and a half times. The Qijiazi Soil and Water Conservation Experiment Station in Fuxin County, Liaoning Province, adopted intercropping of purple alfalfa and sorghum in 1956 (strip intercropping of grass and farmland), producing 2,755 jin of sorghum per hectare, an increase of 89.9% compared to the single cropping of sorghum on the same level of land in the same year, and also yielded an additional 3,000 jin of green grass (alfalfa). In 1957, this station planted sorghum on the stubble of alfalfa, and the yield increased by another 45.8%.
    This fact shows how important planting grass is for the rational utilization and improvement of arable land. In mountainous and sandy areas, there are many farmlands with very poor soil quality. It is a pity to abandon this kind of farmland, but the yield of planting crops is extremely low, and sometimes even a small disaster will not recover the seeds. Some farmers adopt the method of "extensive planting and low harvest," and simply abandon some thin land after planting crops for three or two years. The large amount of abandoned land that exists in various places has been produced in this way. However, abandoning arable land is not a positive method after all. Because even such barren land, if used rationally, can bring us benefits. How to use it? The best way is to use lean land to plant pasture first, or to implement grass-field intercropping or rotation as discussed above. Shanxi Province has decided to implement a "basic farmland" system in mountainous areas with sparse population this year, designating better arable land as "basic farmland" that must be cultivated intensively, and plan to return some arable land that is not suitable for planting crops to pasture and trees, so that no land is left idle. In this way, on the one hand, the total output of crops can be increased due to fine land processing, and on the other hand, those bad lands are rationally utilized, and after several years, these bad lands will also become good lands.
    Planting grass can expand and improve pastures. Natural grasslands are often subject to soil erosion due to overgrazing, hindering grassland renewal and affecting the development of animal husbandry. Therefore, some pastures need to implement mountain closure and gully closure to cultivate grass for a certain period of time, and pasture can be replanted in places lacking grass. Some barren slopes and gullies that are not suitable for cultivation can become new pastures by planting pasture.
    In some mountainous areas in the north, the land is barren, and "three materials" (fuel, feed, fertilizer) are lacking. Planting grass is one of the most effective ways to change this unfavorable situation. Pasture such as sweet clover and purple alfalfa are nutritious livestock feed. These pastures can also be composted. Dry grass can be burned as firewood. The Wujiapan Agricultural Cooperative in Suide County, Shaanxi Province, had 24 draught animals in 1955 and spent 860 yuan to buy forage. In 1956 and 1957, sweet clover was planted, and a large amount of green grass was harvested. In these two years, the number of livestock increased by more than half, and there was a large surplus of forage. In 1957, this cooperative also harvested more than 97,000 jin of dry grass, which was enough to supply each member of the cooperative with three months of firewood. Last year, Suide County used sweet clover to compost more than 1.25 million jin of fertilizer.
    In short, planting grass is a win-win situation and is well worth promoting. Especially in the north, where there are many barren mountains and bald ridges, and many sandy wastelands, more grass should be planted.
    There are many types of grass in my country that can be used as feed and green manure. It is necessary for various places to choose and promote what kind of grass is suitable for planting in what place. Common pastures in the north include alfalfa, sweet clover, and crowfoot grass, etc., and in the south, there are sesbania, flax, and crotalaria, etc. The sweet clover mentioned repeatedly above is a good grass that deserves special attention. It has many advantages: strong adaptability, drought resistance, cold resistance, and salt-alkali resistance; labor-saving planting, and it can be planted in all seasons; it has a great effect on soil and water conservation, grows fast, and has a high yield; it has high nutritional value. The use of sweet clover is not only for "three materials." Its seeds can also be used for oil extraction, brewing, vinegar making, and flour making, and its straw can be peeled for fiber to make ropes. Sweet clover is also a good honey source plant. Some farmers in the Tianshui area of Gansu raise bees in places where sweet clover is planted, and the honey yield is high and the quality is good. Because sweet clover has so many uses, farmers in Gansu call it treasure grass. The reputation of treasure grass is spreading wider and wider, and this year 18 provinces and cities across the country will promote sweet clover. Not long ago, it was just a wild grass growing on the Loess Plateau, but now its value has greatly exceeded that of ordinary pastures. It is not an exaggeration to even call it an economic crop. Are not the various crops we are now planting selected and cultivated by our ancestors from wild grasses thousands of years ago? In the era of the great leap forward in agriculture, wild grasses that can be turned into economic crops are definitely more than just sweet clover. Now, thousands of valuable wild plants have been investigated in various parts of the country. Who can arbitrarily say that several new crops will not be produced from so many wild plants?
