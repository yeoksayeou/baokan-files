Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 20th: The Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has thoroughly reformed the backward irrigation system this year, enabling all more than 4 million mu of farmland in the irrigation area to achieve ridge irrigation, and large fields will be generally converted to furrow irrigation. According to calculations by relevant departments, this reform alone can increase grain production by more than 100 million jin.

At present, the ridge irrigation projects for more than 1 million mu of summer crops such as wheat and flax have been completed, and thousands of farmers are continuing to level land and build dikes and ditches in the autumn crop fields, striving to complete the ridge irrigation project before the autumn crop sowing in May.

For decades, the farmers here have been using a very backward irrigation method—deep flood irrigation—which wastes water, easily alkalizes the land, and affects the expansion of planting area and the increase in grain yield. Last year, the average grain yield per mu in the entire irrigation area was only more than 200 jin. In recent years, relevant departments have conducted many comparative tests, proving that ridge irrigation and furrow irrigation can save water greatly compared with deep flood irrigation, achieve rational irrigation, and the irrigation is uniform, the land will not be alkalized, and grain production can be increased, generally increasing grain production by more than 20% per mu, and the highest can increase by more than two times. In the great leap forward in production from last winter to this spring, the Hetao Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized farmers to launch a large-scale irrigation system reform movement. By the beginning of April, nearly 20,000 various canals had been repaired and dug in the entire irrigation area, and the ridge irrigation area completed reached more than 60% of the total area. Ridge irrigation plots are generally around three mu. In order to facilitate mechanized farming operations, farmers have made the ridge dikes into gentle slopes, and crops can still be planted on the ridge dikes.

The irrigation area of the Hetao Irrigation Area of the Yellow River is second only to the Dujiangyan in Sichuan. Walking into the irrigation area is like being in the Jiangnan region, with canals crisscrossing like spider webs. The entire area now has four large sluices, Jiefang Sluice, Yongji Canal, Fengfu Canal, and Yichang Canal, to divert Yellow River water for irrigation, and the number of large and small canals has reached more than 62,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 20th: The rice planting area in the Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will increase more than fivefold this year compared with last year, expanding to 620,000 mu. At present, the water diversion and drainage projects for rice fields in various banners and counties have already started. A large amount of rice seeds supported by Yinchuan Special Zone of Gansu Province are being transferred here continuously.

This is an alluvial plain of the Yellow River, with fertile land and good water conservancy conditions, which is very suitable for planting rice. Last year, the Fengchan Agricultural Cooperative of Dalate Rear Banner planted 120 mu of rice, with an average yield of 888.5 jin of rice per mu, of which 32 mu yielded 970 jin. However, in the past, due to the lack of planned irrigation, there was fear that planting rice would cause large-scale alkalization of the land. Until last year, only Langshan County and Dalate Rear Banner planted 100,000 mu. This year, the party and government leading organs in the Hetao region mobilized farmers to thoroughly transform the canal irrigation system and began to implement planned irrigation, expanding the rice planting area from 100,000 mu to 620,000 mu. At the beginning of April, the Hetao Administrative Office specifically convened a regional rice conference attended by agricultural cooperative directors and agricultural cooperative technicians to impart and exchange rice planting techniques and experience.

### 彻底改革落后的深淌漫灌方法  内蒙古河套地区实现畦灌  水稻种植面积将比去年增加五倍多

    彻底改革落后的深淌漫灌方法
    内蒙古河套地区实现畦灌
    水稻种植面积将比去年增加五倍多
    新华社呼和浩特20日电　内蒙古自治区黄河后套灌区今年彻底改革落后的灌溉制度，使灌区四百多万亩农田全部实现畦灌，其中大垅田要普遍改为沟灌。据有关部门计算，仅这一项改革就可以增产粮食一亿多斤。
    目前，一百多万亩小麦、胡麻等夏田作物的农田畦灌工程，已经完成，成千上万的农民正在秋田作物田间继续平整土地，打堰修渠，争取在5月间秋田作物播种前全部完成畦灌工程。
    几十年来，这里的农民都是沿用一种非常落后的灌溉方法——深淌漫灌，既浪费用水，又容易使土地碱化，影响播种面积的扩大和粮食产量的提高。去年全灌区每亩粮食平均产量，只有二百多斤。几年来，有关部门曾经多次进行对比试验，证明畦灌和沟灌比深淌漫灌可以大大节省用水，做到合理灌溉，而且灌溉均匀，土地不会碱化，能够增产粮食，一般每亩可增产粮食20％以上，最高的增产两倍多。在去冬今春的生产大跃进中，中共河套地方委员会发动农民展开了大规模的灌溉制度改革运动。到4月上旬，全灌区共修挖各种渠道近两万条，完成畦灌面积达总面积60％以上。畦灌地块一般都在三亩上下。为了便利机耕作业，农民把畦堰都做成缓坡形状，畦堰上照旧可以种植作物。
    黄河后套灌区的灌溉面积仅次于四川的都江堰。走进灌区好像置身江南，渠道纵横，有如蛛网。全区现有解放闸、永济渠、丰复渠、义长渠等四个大水闸引黄水灌溉，大小渠道已达六万二千多条。
    新华社呼和浩特20日电　内蒙古自治区黄河后套灌区今年水稻种植面积将比去年增加五倍多，扩大到六十二万亩。现在，各旗县的稻田引水和排水工程已经动工。甘肃省银川专区支援的大量水稻种籽，正在向这里源源调运。
    这里是黄河冲积平原，土地肥沃，水利条件又好，很适宜种植水稻。去年达拉特后旗丰产农业社种了一百二十亩水稻，平均每亩产稻谷八百八十八点五斤，其中有三十二亩产九百七十斤。但过去由于没有实行计划灌溉，怕种稻后引起土地大量碱化，到去年为止只有狼山县和达拉特后旗种了十万亩。今年河套地区党政领导机关发动农民彻底改造了渠灌溉道系统，开始实行计划灌溉，将水稻种植面积由十万亩扩大到六十二万亩。4月初，河套专署曾经专门召开了由农业社主任和农业社技术员参加的全区水稻会议，传授和交流种稻技术和经验。
