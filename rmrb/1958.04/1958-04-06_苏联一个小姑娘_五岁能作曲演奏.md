Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 5th: A little girl from Kiev named Natalia Molochinaia (see picture above), only five years old, has already composed twelve pieces of music. At her home, friends and neighbors often come to listen to her play her own compositions, such as "Golden Autumn" and "Flying Swans."

Little Natasha is very playful, but when she sits down at the piano, she becomes quiet and well-behaved. Her feet can't even reach the piano pedals, and her little hands can only reach a little more than four octaves.

Natasha only started learning piano a few months ago. Her parents discovered her musical talent and sent her to a music school. The music teacher carefully listened to the pieces Natasha played and asked her to study at home. It turns out that Natasha is indeed a talented student. Some of the children's songs and dances she plays are very beautiful. In addition, she loves to listen to the works of Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and Schubert. (Picture attached)

    苏联一个小姑娘
    五岁能作曲演奏
    据新华社莫斯科5日电　基辅的一个名叫娜塔丽雅·莫洛奇娜亚（见上图）的小姑娘，年纪只有五岁就已经创作了十二支曲子。在她家里，朋友们和邻居们经常来听她演奏自己创作的“金色的秋天”和“飞翔着的天鹅”等小曲子。
    小娜塔莎非常贪玩，但一坐到钢琴旁边就乖乖地一声不响了，她的脚还碰不到钢琴的踏脚板，小手只能够到四个多音键。
    娜塔莎学钢琴还只是几个月前的事。她的父母发现她有音乐方面的才能，于是就把她送到一个音乐学校去。音乐老师仔细地倾听了娜塔莎演奏的曲子，叫她在家里学习。事实证明娜塔莎确是一个有才华的学生，她演奏的一些儿童乐曲和舞曲十分动听；此外她非常爱听莫扎特、贝多芬、柴可夫斯基和舒伯特的作品。（附图片）
