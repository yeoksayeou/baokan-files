How to Cultivate Experimental Plots Well?
—Introduction to the Experience of Hong'an County

How to make cadres cultivating "experimental plots" a formal system, and to continuously consolidate and improve it in practice? Hong'an County has accumulated systematic experience in this regard.

Hong'an County solves the problem from two aspects: on the one hand, strengthening ideological work, especially educating cadres by summarizing advanced models, so that everyone truly understands the benefits and methods of cultivating "experimental plots"; on the other hand, adopting organizational measures to guarantee and supervise, mainly organizing regular inspections and comparisons.

Since last winter, Hong'an County has conducted a series of activities to summarize and promote advanced experiences in cadre cultivation of "experimental plots." For example, cadres in Xinse, Dajin, Zhanidian, Miaozui, and Mier townships have greatly changed the face of production due to their earnest cultivation of "experimental plots," and have been widely welcomed by the masses. The county party committee summarized and promoted these experiences, calling on cadres throughout the county to learn from them.

Inspections and comparisons have been institutionalized. Since last winter, the county has conducted four county-wide production inspections and comparisons, with representatives from each township and commune participating, in addition to county and district leaders. To facilitate inspection and comparison, the "experimental plots" of all cadres in the county have cards. The contents of these cards include: the area of ​​the field, the types of crops and planned yield; measures to complete the plan; the opinions of the higher-level inspections; and major experiences and lessons. Mass inspections and comparisons are generally carried out by township, or by district or commune.

The implementation of the above methods has resulted in the advanced being commended and the backward being criticized, thus promoting the advanced to be more advanced and the backward to catch up with the advanced, which has a great effect on educating and urging cadres to cultivate "experimental plots" well. In February, when Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the county party committee, went to the countryside to inspect work, he found that the main cadres of Xinse Township, led by Song Zhixiang, the party general branch secretary, paid attention to ideological work on the one hand, and actively took the lead in cultivating "experimental plots" well, which made the production campaign in the township a great success and all work was outstanding; while the first secretary of the Tongbai Township General Branch, Ai Shuxun, and several main cadres, because they did not cultivate the "experimental plots" well, their calls had no power, the production campaign could not be carried out, and everything was cold and deserted. In response to this situation, in addition to criticizing the cadres of Tongbai Township on the spot, the county party committee informed the whole county with these two townships as typical examples, requiring all localities to draw on the experiences and lessons of the two townships. Later, the cadres of Tongbai Township resolutely changed their work style and quickly launched the production campaign. The cadres of other townships also generally reviewed their own "experimental plots" in connection with the experience and lessons of the two townships. (Fang Di)

    怎样种好试验田？
    ——红安县经验介绍
    如何使干部种“试验田”形成为一种制度，并且在实践过程中不断地巩固和提高，在这方面，红安县积累了系统的经验。
    红安县是从两方面来解决问题的：一方面，加强思想工作，特别是通过总结先进典型来教育干部，使大家真正地了解种“试验田”的好处和方法；另一方面，是采取组织措施来保证和监督，主要是组织经常性的检查、评比。
    红安县从去冬以来在干部种“试验田”方面曾经进行过一系列的总结先进和推广先进的工作。例如，新塞、大金、占店、庙咀和觅儿等乡的干部，都由于认真种“试验田”使生产面貌大改观，受到群众的普遍欢迎。县委的经验总结推广了，号召全县干部学习。
    在检查、评比方面，已经制度化。去冬以来，全县曾经进行过四次全县性的生产检查、评比，除县、区领导干部外各乡、社，都有代表参加。为了便于检查、评比，全县干部的“试验田”都有卡片。这种卡片的内容有：田的面积、作物种类和计划产量；完成计划的措施；上级检查的意见；以及主要经验、教训等。群众性的检查、评比，一般是以乡为单位来进行，也有以区或社为单位进行的。
    实行以上办法后，先进的受到了表扬，落后的受到批评，因而能够促使先进的更先进，落后的赶先进，对教育和督促干部认真种好“试验田”有极大的作用。2月间县委第一书记程鹏下乡检查工作时，发现新塞乡以党总支书记宋志祥为首的乡主要干部，除个别的外，都注意了一面作思想工作，一面积极带头种好“试验田”，使全乡生产运动搞得轰轰烈烈，各项工作都很出色；而桐柏乡的总支第一书记艾树勋和几个主要干部，因为“试验田”没有搞好，所以他们的号召没有力量，生产运动搞不起来，到处冷冷清清的。针对这种情况，程鹏除当场批评了桐柏乡的干部外，县委并以这两个乡为典型通报全县，要各地吸取两个乡的经验、教训。以后，桐柏乡的干部坚决转变了作风，很快就把生产运动搞起来了。其它乡的干部也普遍联系检查了自己的“试验田”，吸取了两乡的经验、教训。　　　　　（方堤）
