    Pinyin Letters and Chess Pieces
    Currently, the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet scheme is being vigorously promoted nationwide. Shop signs, traffic signposts... in the future, pinyin letters will be annotated alongside Chinese characters. The Xiangqi (Chinese chess) game, which has been popular among the people for a long time, should also follow suit. It is suggested that handicraft factories can engrave Chinese Pinyin letters on the surface of the chess pieces during the production of new chess pieces in the future.
    This will not only help beginners of Xiangqi, but also arouse the interest of some people who already understand Chinese characters to automatically learn the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet.

    拼音字母与棋子
    现在，汉语拼音方案正在全国大力推行。商店的牌匾，交通中的路标，……今后均将在汉字旁边注上拼音字母。在民间流传至久的象棋也自不能例外。建议各工艺社今后制作新的棋子时，最好能在棋面上刻制汉语拼音字母。
    这样，不但会有助于初学象棋者，而且还能借以引起一些已经通晓汉字的人自动学习汉语拼音字母的兴趣。
