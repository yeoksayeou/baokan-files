    Gansu's Mountainous Areas and Remote Villages
    New Schools Springing Up Daily
    (Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou) A mass upsurge in running schools has appeared in various parts of Gansu Province. Recently, in remote villages and mountainous areas, new community-run primary schools have been established daily. In Wushan County, in the central mountainous region, 108 primary schools were established by the masses in March, raising the enrollment rate of school-age children from 80.4% to 98%. A situation has emerged in the county where every village, commune, and household has a school, and every family has students. In March, Lintao County also established 200 community-run schools, increasing the enrollment rate of school-age children from 52.7% to over 95%.
    The teachers in these community-run primary schools are selected and hired from middle school graduates who have returned to their hometowns for production, demobilized soldiers, and cadres who have been sent to lower levels. School funding is resolved through tuition fees and agricultural cooperative public welfare funds. Some cooperatives leave a bit of "study land" for the school, allowing teachers and students to participate in labor. Teachers and students in some schools also participate in sideline activities such as pig raising, firewood gathering, and medicinal herb digging in agricultural cooperatives to increase the source of school funding. Various places have also established guidance networks for community-run primary school teachers, with public complete primary schools as the center, to provide regular teaching guidance to community-run primary school teachers.

    甘肃山区和偏僻村庄
    天天出现新学校
    据新华社兰州讯　甘肃省各地出现了群众办学的热潮。最近，在偏僻的村庄和山区，每天都有新的民办小学办起来。中部山区的武山县，在3月份依靠群众办起了小学一百零八所，学龄儿童入学率由80.4％上升到98％，全县出现了村村社社有学校，家家户户有学生的局面。临洮县在3月份也办起了民办学校二百所，使学龄儿童入学率由52.7％上升到95％以上。
    这些民办小学的教师都从回乡生产的中学毕业生、转业军人和下放干部中选聘的。学校经费由收学费和农业社公益金中解决。有的由社内给学校留一点“学田”，供教师和学生参加劳动。有的学校师生还参加农业社的养猪、打柴、挖药材等副业活动，以增加学校经费来源。各地还以公立完全小学为中心，建立起民办小学教师辅导网，对民办小学教师定期进行教学辅导。
