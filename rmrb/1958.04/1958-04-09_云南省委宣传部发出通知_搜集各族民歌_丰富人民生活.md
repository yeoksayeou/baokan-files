    Yunnan Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department Issues Notice
    Collect Folk Songs of All Ethnic Groups to Enrich People's Lives
    (Our Dispatch) Yunnan Province's twenty ethnic minority peoples' new folk songs expressing their enthusiasm for socialist construction will be systematically collected by Party organizations at all levels in Yunnan Province. The Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department issued a "Immediately Organize the Collection of Folk Songs" notice to local county Party committees on the 3rd.
    The notice said: In the socialist Great Leap Forward, many folk songs, mountain songs, folk rhymes and ditties singing about the leap forward and current production struggles have emerged among the various ethnic groups in Yunnan. Especially among ethnic groups with a tradition of singing, such as the Dai, Bai, Yi, Miao, Lisu, Hani, and Naxi, many new works singing about struggle have emerged. It not only enriches the people's cultural life, but also helps increase the socialist consciousness of all ethnic groups. Therefore, great attention should be paid to collecting them.
    The notice pointed out that the method of collecting folk songs is that the propaganda departments of local county Party committees should use meeting opportunities to explain the significance to responsible cadres of the county, districts, and townships, and then mobilize cadres and masses in reservoir construction sites, agricultural cooperatives, and industrial and mining enterprises to distribute three to five sheets of paper to write and record folk songs. Those who cannot write can find someone to write for them, and folk songs dictated by ethnic minority masses should be recorded and translated.
    The notice requested that folk songs with good content and high artistic value, whether short or long, should be collected. Old folk songs circulating among various ethnic groups that have not yet been collected should also be recorded this time. Folk epics and long narrative poems that have not been organized should also be noted for excavation.
    The notice requested that the folk songs collected by each county should be submitted to the Provincial Party Committee within one month.
