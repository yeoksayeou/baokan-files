The Landlord

    The first night I arrived, my landlord cleaned two rooms for me, scraped off the old mud plaster from the walls, and whitewashed them. Because it was spring, and he was worried I'd be cold, he installed a stove, repaired the new door, and pasted red paper on the window curtains. I loved my new home the moment I walked in.

    It was embarrassing every time we ate because they always cooked better food just for me. The old man said, "We all eat from the same pot, don't be shy, you need to eat well to have the strength to work." The old woman always put a specially made, finer grain cake with less chaff outside the steamer rack, smiling and saying, "It's all the same, eat up quickly!" But I noticed that the old man and old woman always reached for the cakes inside the rack. When I lifted the cloth covering the cakes, I saw they were eating cakes made with only vegetables and chaff, with no grain at all. From then on, I would try to grab those cakes when we ate. But they wouldn't let me eat them, no matter what. I would hold my bowl right up to my mouth, leaving no gap, or the old woman would throw the finer grain cake into my bowl, forcing me to eat it.

    One day at noon, I came back from work, and the old woman offered me cabbage stewed with fine grain cake. Seeing it was fine grain, I said, "I'll just have the cabbage." The old woman said, "We've all eaten, you came back late from the fields, you're the only one who hasn't eaten yet." So I ate it. After the meal, I went to the kitchen to get a drink, and I saw the old man and old woman eating cornbread made with chaff and vegetables. I was so moved that tears streamed down my face. It wasn't that the government wasn't providing grain; it was that my landlord had repeatedly assured them that he wouldn't ask the state for a single grain. Because in 1957, Shandong Province had suffered from the worst floods and droughts in a century. My landlord said we should tighten our belts and support the disaster victims.

    One evening, the old woman was doing needlework on the bed, and I started chatting with her. I said, "You've been too good to me." The old woman said, "You're all good cadres educated by Chairman Mao, here to help us live a happy life. If you don't eat well or drink well, how can we face Chairman Mao?" That night, I couldn't sleep, thinking about the old woman's words.

Passing the "Mountain" Hurdle

    I went to Liulin District with County Magistrate Wan. He was assigned to the countryside as the Party Committee Secretary, and I was there as his secretary.

    I'm a semi-detached cadre, and I'll be working in the experimental fields. So far, I've only earned three work points. I've only officially worked for half a day; the rest of the time, I've been organizing documents, attending meetings, and repairing the courtyard in front of the township government building. This courtyard is over an acre in size, and we plan to plant potatoes, vegetables, tomatoes, and other crops there.

    On "March 8th" Women's Day, under the leadership of Township Head Wang, we went up the mountain to dig a cistern. Before setting off, Township Head Wang specially introduced me as a cadre "from the central government." Everyone stared at me, and my face flushed red with embarrassment.

    The women of northern Shaanxi are truly remarkable. They go up high mountains as if walking on flat ground, chatting and laughing all the way to the top. But I, the cadre "from the central government," was truly climbing, using all fours, barely making it to the top. And then, I had to dig a cistern on a very steep slope. I didn't dare look down, only focusing on the patch of soil beneath my feet. I desperately shoveled the soil, managing only a few shovelfuls. Fortunately, I had dug a ditch in Nanyuan last winter and learned how to use a shovel; otherwise, I would have been an even bigger good-for-nothing.

    "Going up the mountain" is truly a big hurdle for me. Here, we are surrounded by mountains. Labor requires going up the mountain, visiting neighbors requires going up the mountain, attending meetings requires going up the mountain, everything requires going up the mountain. If I can't overcome this hurdle, then there's nothing to talk about. I must, I will, overcome this hurdle.

Bean Paste Buns

    For several days, the meals prepared by Sister-in-law Wang have been bean paste buns (dumplings made with corn flour skin and red bean paste filling) every day. After eating them for three or four days, I gradually began to notice a sour taste in the bean paste buns. Although I didn't say anything, I gradually changed from eating two buns per meal to eating just one. My landlord, Sister-in-law Wang, found it strange. During meals, she always let me and Brother Wang eat first, while she and the children ate some stir-fried bean dregs or vermicelli and chaff buns and other staple foods. I really wanted to eat something else, but I was too embarrassed to mention it.

    Once during a meal, I was chatting with the old landlady and mentioned her family's life. She said, "Your brother has been away for a long time and only returned home last year to participate in commune work. The family is still not well-off this year; otherwise, how could we have only steamed two pots of bean paste buns for the Spring Festival!" She pointed to the buns on the table and explained, "In the countryside, every family has to steam several pots of these buns for the New Year, and traditionally we eat them straight through to the Lantern Festival..." Before she finished speaking, I realized why I had been eating bean paste buns every day – Sister-in-law Wang was letting us assigned cadres eat the good things from the New Year, while she herself ate stir-fried bean dregs and vermicelli and chaff buns.

    The next day during mealtime, I asked to eat bean dregs and vermicelli. That day, Sister-in-law Wang still insisted that I eat a bean paste bun, but this time, I didn't think it was sour; instead, I thought it was very sweet.

Handbook

    I have had all sorts of notebooks: cloth-covered, silk-covered; bright red, beige; gilded, dotted with red; with pictures of Tiananmen Square or peace doves. In these notebooks, I recorded everything in my life.

    But today, I have a new notebook in my hand: a commune member's work record book.

    This is a thin, simple booklet with a red cloth cover. It does not contain any flowery words or pleasant wishes. It only honestly records my labor tasks: carrying manure, carrying pond mud, repairing reservoirs, planting trees, or weeding, followed by unambiguous numbers—work points.

Every evening, under the kerosene lamp, when I see my labor achievements in my notebook, I feel so happy and excited.

    新社员的新生活
    房东
    我来的头天晚上，我家房东给我打扫了两间屋，剥去了墙上的旧泥皮，粉刷了白石灰。春天啦，还怕我冷，给盘上炉子，修理了新门，用红纸糊了窗帘。我一进门就爱上了我的家。
    每当吃饭时，真难为人，他们老是单给我做好的吃。大爷说：“咱一口锅里摸勺啊，别客气，吃饱了干活才有力气。”大娘老是把一种单做的掺糠少的细干粮搁在篦子外边，笑着说：“都是一样的、快吃吧”，可是我发现大娘大爷老是伸手拿篦子里边的吃，我掀开盖干粮的笼布一看，他们吃的是没有一点粮食，只是菜和糠做成的干粮，以后吃饭时我就抢吃这种的。可是他们说什么也不让我吃，我就把饭碗端到紧靠嘴边上不留一点空隙，要不，大娘就把细干粮扔到我碗里强让我吃。
    一天中午我干活回来，大娘让我吃白菜烩细干粮，我看是细粮的，说：“大娘我吃菜的。”大娘说：“我们都吃了，你下坡回来晚了，只剩你没吃了。”我就吃了。饭后我到饭屋去喝水，大爷大娘正在吃糠菜窝头呢，我心里一激动，眼泪扑??地流下来。原来不是政府没有粮食供应，是我家房东再三保证不伸手向国家要一粒粮食。因为在1957年山东省有四十六个县遭受到百年未有的大水、旱灾，我家房东说要节衣缩食，支援灾民。
    一天晚上，大娘在炕上做针线活，我和大娘攀谈起来，我说：“大娘家里对我太好了。”大娘说：“你们都是毛主席教育出来的好干部，是来帮助我们过幸福日子的，你要是吃不好，喝不好，俺对得起毛主席吗？”这晚上我躺在床上总是睡不着，思索着大娘的话。	    山东桓台县龙南村胜利社      佟玉林	渡过“高山”关
    我和万县长一起到柳林区，他下放在乡里当党委书记，我是来当党委书记的秘书的。
    我是半脱产干部，以后在试验田里工作，到现在为止我还只得到三个工分，我只正式劳动过半天，其余时间都在整理文件、开会和整修乡政府前的大院子。这院子有一亩多地，我们准备在这里种洋芋、青菜、西红柿等。
    “三八”妇女节那天，在姓王的女乡长领导之下，上山去挖水窖。在出发前女乡长还特地介绍了我这位“中央来的”干部，大家都对我行注目礼，我满脸通红，狼狈不堪。
    陕北的妇女真了不得，上高山如履平地，谈谈笑笑就到了山顶，而我这位“中央来的”干部却真正地在爬山，四肢并用，勉强爬到山顶，还要站在很陡的山坡上挖水窖，我根本不敢往下看，只看我脚下的一块土。我死劲地用锹铲土，还能铲几下。幸而去年冬天我到南苑去挖过渠，学会了使用锹，否则更是个大饭桶了。
    “上山”对我来说实在是一个大关，这里四周是高山，劳动要上山，串门要上山，开会要上山，干什么都要上山，如果我不能渡过这一关，那就什么也不谈了。我一定要、一定会渡过这一关。

    豆馅饽饽
    几天来，王大嫂给准备的饭，天天是豆馅饽饽（用玉米面作皮，小豆作馅的团子）。吃了三四天后，渐渐觉得豆馅饽饽有些酸味。嘴里虽没说出来，但是由起初每顿吃两个改为吃一个。房东王大嫂也奇怪，吃饭时，总让我和王大哥先吃，她和孩子后吃一些什么炒豆渣或粉渣窝窝等别的主食。我很想吃些别的，但是碍着面子，没有提出来。
    有一回吃饭时，我和房东老奶奶闲拉话，提到她家的生活。她说：“你大哥一直在外边，去年才回到家里，参加社的工作，今年家里还不宽裕，要不然，春节哪能才蒸两锅豆馅饽饽呢！”她指着桌上的饽饽又解释说：“乡下过年，谁家都得蒸几锅这样的饽饽，讲究直吃到元宵节……”她还没说完，我就想到这几天为什么老吃豆馅饽饽的原因——王大嫂把过年的好东西让给我们下放干部吃，她自己吃炒豆渣和粉渣窝窝。
    第二天吃饭，我提出要吃豆渣和粉渣。那天，王大嫂还硬让我吃了一个豆馅饽饽，可是，这次，我没觉得酸，而是觉得非常甜。

          手册
    我有过各式各样的本子：布面的、绢面的；大红的、米黄的；飞金的、点朱的；画着天安门或者和平鸽的。在这些本子上，记录着我生活中的一切。
    可是，今天，在我手里有了一个新的本子：社员劳动手册。
    这是一本薄薄的，红色布面的简陋的小册子。里面并没有记下华丽的词藻，动听的祝愿，它只老老实实的记下我劳动的事项：挑粪、挑塘泥、修水库、栽树或者锄草，后面跟着毫不含糊的数字——工分。
  每一个晚上，在煤油灯下，当我在自己的本子上看到我劳动成绩的时候，我是感到那么愉快和兴奋。
