    The Popularization and Improvement of Industry

    Since the great leap forward in local industry, many light industrial products that originally needed to be supplied by large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin can now be produced locally. This new situation has begun to restrict the sales of certain light industrial products in large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin. Some contradictions have arisen between the new local industries and the original industrial bases.

    The emergence of this contradiction is indeed an encouraging and good thing. It shows that China's industry has developed rapidly, and the unreasonable situation of industrial distribution where even a pack of matches had to be supplied by Shanghai has begun to change.

    However, do the industries in Shanghai and other places have no future, and can they not develop? The answer is: they have a great future and can develop greatly. This means abandoning old, ordinary products that can be produced in general areas, and relying on the technical conditions of large cities to manufacture new, high-end products that cannot be produced in general areas. It is a completely correct measure for the Shanghai Municipal Light Industry Bureau to rebuild six match factories into factories producing plastic products, sewing machines, and other products. Each prefecture, each county, and each township bears the task of popularizing industry; while Shanghai, the original industrial base, uses new technologies and new products to drive China's industry to catch up with the world's advanced level. This is the correct way to solve this new contradiction in the current economic life.

    工业的普及和提高
    地方工业大跃进以来，许多地方原来需要从上海、天津等大城市供应的某些轻工业产品，现在可以自己生产了。这个新的情况，开始使上海、天津等大城市的某些轻工业产品的销路受到限制。新的地方工业和原有的工业基地之间发生了一些矛盾。
    这矛盾的出现，实在是一件令人鼓舞的好事。它说明我国的工业有了迅速的发展，一包火柴都要由上海来供应的工业分布不合理的状况开始有了改变。
    然而，上海等地的工业还有没有前途，能不能发展呢？答曰：大有前途、大可发展。这就是舍弃旧的、一般地区都能生产的普通产品，依靠大城市的技术条件，制造新的、一般地区不能生产的高级产品。上海市轻工业局把六个火柴厂改建为制造塑料制品、缝纫机等产品的工厂，是完全正确的措施。每个专区，每个县，每个乡，都担负着工业的普及任务；而上海，这个原有工业基地，则用新技术、新产品，带动我国工业赶上世界先进水平。这就是解决目前经济生活中这个新矛盾的正确途径。
