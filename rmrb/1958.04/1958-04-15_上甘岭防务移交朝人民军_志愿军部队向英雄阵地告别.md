Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 14th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units guarding Shangganling have transferred the position's defense to the Korean People's Army.

Prior to the defense transfer, the Volunteer Army soldiers repaired, cleaned, and reinforced all tunnel fortifications, trenches, and bunkers. Fine sand was laid around the barracks, and willow trees were planted.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 14th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army units guarding Shangganling solemnly held a farewell ceremony to the heroic Shangganling position on the 6th.

On this day, the spring rain had just stopped, and the weather was sunny and mild. Major General Pan Yan, Major General Dai Runsheng, and other unit leaders and soldiers, facing the trenches and fortifications, solemnly bid farewell to the heroic position they had diligently guarded for several years.

Major General Pan Yan delivered a farewell speech on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Shangganling units, saying that the blood of outstanding sons and daughters of China and Korea had been shed on the Shangganling position. Combat hero Huang Jiguang and support-the-front model worker Park Jae-geun sacrificed their lives together here. As we are about to withdraw from Korea and return to our motherland, we solemnly swear: in the future, we will continue to take the heroes in the Battle of Shangganling as our example, forever loyal to the cause of peace, and forever be the most beloved people.

Then, Major General Pan Yan, Major General Dai Runsheng, and the unit's officers and soldiers planted pine and willow trees on the heroic position they were about to leave. They also used white stones to build the twelve large characters "Long Live Peace" and "Eternal Friendship Between China and Korea" on the steep cliff behind the position and on the hillside of Mount Wu Sheng opposite it.
