    A Record of Vice-Chairman Jaroszewicz's Visit
    By Our Correspondent Yu Minsheng
    We entered this large hall, where thick, soft carpets muffled the sound of footsteps. Along the wall stood a row of red velvet sofas, and opposite them were potted plants with two evergreen palms. All this gave a feeling of freshness and tranquility.
    Six distinguished guests received us together.
    The one leading the group, tall and wearing a camel-gray suit, was Comrade Jaroszewicz, Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland.
    After warmly shaking hands with us, Vice-Chairman Jaroszewicz introduced the other five distinguished guests to us one by one. They were members of the delegation: Foreign Trade Minister Trampczynski, Vice-Chairman of the Planning Commission Jaszczuk, Head of the Economic Department of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee Olszewski, Vice-Minister of Finance Kole, and Vice-Minister of Heavy Industry Koi.
    It was already eleven o'clock at night. Tomorrow morning – April 8th – the distinguished guests would be leaving Beijing to return home.
    "We are very sorry to disturb your rest so late," we said.
    "No, we should thank you, thank you for coming to visit us," the Vice-Chairman laughed, and the other guests laughed too.
    An atmosphere of harmony and friendship filled the hall. Our interview began in this friendly atmosphere.
    "The Chinese people are very concerned about the socialist construction being carried out by the Polish people, and we hope that the Vice-Chairman can introduce this aspect of the situation," we raised the first question.
    "The Polish people, like the great Chinese people, are busy with peaceful socialist construction," Vice-Chairman Jaroszewicz began to answer our question.
    "The goal of achieving the current Five-Year Plan is to further improve the productivity of People's Poland, greatly alleviate the imbalance between industrial and agricultural development, improve the material conditions of the working people, and raise the cultural level of the people."
    "The main focus now is on improving labor productivity, fighting against waste, reducing production costs, implementing technological reforms more quickly, and improving the technical level of workers. In agriculture, we are fighting to rapidly increase agricultural and livestock products. In 1957, Poland's industrial production increased by 10%, and agricultural production also saw a large increase. Judging from the production situation in the first quarter of this year, the planned tasks for 1958 are being successfully completed."
    Vice-Chairman Jaroszewicz, who is not yet fifty years old, is mainly responsible for national economic affairs in Poland. No wonder he is so familiar with the situation of socialist construction in Poland.
    Just this morning (7th), Vice-Chairman Jaroszewicz and Vice-Premier Chen Yi, representing the governments of China and Poland respectively, signed the Sino-Polish Long-Term Trade Agreement for 1959-1962.
    "The Sino-Polish Long-Term Trade Agreement has been signed, and we hope that the Vice-Chairman can talk about its role in the economic development of the two countries."
    Regarding this question, Vice-Chairman Jaroszewicz said:
    "The first long-term trade agreement signed between the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Poland is of great significance to our two countries. It allows us to better arrange production tasks in our long-term economic plans. It allows our two countries to better produce things that meet our mutual needs. This long-term trade agreement is of great significance for accelerating the economic development of our two countries and for strengthening the strength of the entire socialist camp."
    When the topic turned to the distinguished guests' impressions of visiting China, the hall seemed particularly lively.
    "Our visit to China for just over ten days," the Vice-Chairman said, "has not allowed us to carefully understand your great country. But despite this, what we have seen has left us with an extremely deep impression."
    "The efforts made by the Chinese people in the cause of socialist transformation in the past are of historic significance. Today, hundreds of millions of Chinese people are making new efforts for the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The great enthusiasm shown by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government to achieve this great leap forward is the best guarantee for the Chinese people to successfully complete their great tasks."
    "Our delegation has been warmly welcomed everywhere in China, which proves that the brotherly friendship between our two countries is becoming more and more consolidated. We are convinced that the trade agreement signed between our two countries will be conducive to strengthening the economic strength of our two countries and the entire socialist camp."
    Speaking here, the Vice-Chairman paused slightly, and then added: "Everywhere in China, we have not encountered a single collective or individual who does not take a positive attitude towards the nationwide great leap forward in production. We express our infinite admiration from the bottom of our hearts for the Chinese people's high level of patriotism."
    "That's all I want to talk about. Now, I would like to invite other comrades in our delegation to talk about their impressions," the Vice-Chairman looked at the other distinguished guests and then smiled at us.
    "If I were to talk about personal impressions, then the speed of China's industrial and agricultural development really makes me admire it. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge vividly illustrates the rapid development of China's technical and economic strength. The word 'backward' has slowly become a thing of the past in China, and I believe that China will soon become a strong industrial power." This was the impression of Comrade Olszewski, Head of the Economic Department of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party.
    The impression of Jaszczuk, Vice-Chairman of the Planning Commission, is this: "The Chinese Communist Party is implementing a wise policy and demonstrating outstanding organizational skills. It has mobilized the strength of the broad masses, allowing the masses to tap their own potential, and tens of millions of big-character posters are the best proof of this. Everyone is thinking of ways to solve difficulties, and everyone is learning how to manage their own country well."
    What are the impressions of Koi, Vice-Minister of Heavy Industry, who has already visited China for the fourth time? He said: "China is developing so fast, it's a different look every time, and China is becoming stronger and stronger. China's achievements are not only reflected in construction, but also in management and organization. The organization and discipline of the Chinese people are admirable!"
    Unconsciously, it was almost twelve o'clock. When we said goodbye, we wished the distinguished guests a safe journey home tomorrow, and wished that the Sino-Polish friendship would blossom like spring flowers on the land of both countries!

    雅罗谢维奇副主席访问记
    本报记者　于民生
    我们走进这座宽大的大厅里，厚厚的细软的地毯吞没着走路的脚步声。在靠墙的地方摆着一排红色天鹅绒沙发，对面是两株常青棕榈的盆景。这一切，给人以清新和安静的感觉。
    六位贵宾一起接待我们。
    为首的一位，高高的身材，穿着一套驼灰色西服的，是波兰部长会议副主席雅罗谢维奇同志。
    在同我们热情地握手以后，雅罗谢维奇副主席把另外五位贵宾向我们一一作了介绍。他们是代表团团员：对外贸易部长特朗姆普钦斯基，计划委员会副主席雅希楚克，波兰统一工人党中央经济部长奥尔谢夫斯基，财政部副部长科莱，重工业部副部长科依。
    时间已是深夜十一点。明天——4月8日一清早，贵宾们就要离开北京回国了。
    “很抱歉，在这样晚还来打扰客人们休息。”我们说：
    “不，我们应该感谢你们，感谢你们来访问我们。”副主席笑起来，其他的客人们也都笑了。
    一种和谐和友谊的气氛洋溢在这个大厅里。我们的访问就在这种充满友谊的气氛中开始了。
    “中国人民很关心波兰人民进行社会主义建设的情况，我们希望副主席能够介绍一下这方面的情况。”我们提出了第一个问题。
    “波兰人民像伟大的中国人民一样，正在忙于和平的社会主义建设。”雅罗谢维奇副主席开始回答我们的问题。
    “实现目前的五年计划的目的，是进一步提高人民波兰的生产力，大大缓和工业和农业发展的不平衡现象，改善劳动人民的物质条件，提高人民的文化水平。”
    “目前主要的努力方向是提高劳动生产率，同浪费现象作斗争，降低生产成本，更快地实行技术改革，提高职工的技术水平。在农业方面，我们正在为迅速地提高农产品和畜产品而斗争。1957年波兰的工业生产提高了10％，农业生产也有很大的提高。根据今年第一季度的生产情况来看，1958年的计划任务正在顺利完成。”
    不满五十岁的雅罗谢维奇副主席在波兰主要是负责国家经济方面的事务的，难怪他说起波兰社会主义建设的情况是那样了如指掌。
    就在今天（七日）上午，雅罗谢维奇副主席和陈毅副总理分别代表中波两国政府签订了中波关于1959——1962年长期贸易协定。
    “中波长期贸易协定已经签字了，我们希望副主席谈谈它对两国的经济发展的作用。”
    关于这个问题，雅罗谢维奇副主席是这样说的：
    “中华人民共和国和波兰人民共和国之间签订的第一个长期贸易协定，对于我们两国有着重大的意义。它可以使我们在长期的经济计划中，更好地安排生产任务。它可以使我们两国更好地生产适应于满足我们相互所需要的东西。这种长期贸易协定对加速我们两国的经济发展，对于加强整个社会主义阵营的力量，都有着重大意义。”
    当话题转到贵宾们访问中国的印象时，大厅里显得特别活跃。
    “我们在中国短短十几天的访问，”副主席说：“我们还不能仔细地了解你们伟大的国家。但是尽管这样，我们所看到的东西还是给我们留下了极为深刻的印象。”
    “中国人民过去在社会主义改造事业中所作出的努力，有着历史性的意义。今天，亿万中国人民正在为了工业和农业生产大跃进而作出新的努力。中国人民在中国共产党和中国政府领导下为实现这个大跃进所表现出来的巨大热情，是中国人民胜利完成自己的伟大任务的最好保证。”
    “我们代表团在中国各地都受到了热情的欢迎，这证明我们两国之间兄弟般的友谊联系是越来越巩固了。我们深信，我们两国所签订的贸易协定，将有利于加强我们两国和整个社会主义阵营的经济力量。”
    谈到这里，副主席稍微停了一下，然后又补充说：“在中国各地，我们没有遇到一个集体或一个人对全民的生产大跃进不采取积极的态度。我们对中国人民高度热爱祖国的热情，从心里表示无限敬佩。”
    “我所要谈的就是这一些。现在，我想请我们代表团的其他同志谈一谈他们的印象。”副主席看看其他贵宾，然后微笑着对我们说。
    “如果要谈谈个人印象的话，那么中国工农业发展的速度实在使我敬佩。武汉的长江大桥就生动的说明了中国技术力量和经济力量的飞快发展。‘落后’两个字在中国已经慢慢成为过去了，我相信不久中国就会变成一个工业强国。”这是波兰统一工人党中央经济部长奥尔谢夫斯基同志的印象。
    计划委员会副主席雅希楚克的印象是这样的：“中国共产党执行着英明的政策，表现出卓越的组织能力。它动员了广大群众力量，让群众自己挖掘潜力，几千万张大字报就是最好的证明。所有的人都在想办法解决困难，都在学习怎样管理好自己的国家。”
    重工业部副部长科依已经是第四次访问中国了，他的印象怎样呢？他说：“中国的发展真快，一次是一个样子，中国越来越强大。中国的成就不仅表现在建设上，而且表现在管理和组织工作方面。中国人民的组织性和纪律性是令人钦佩的！”
    不知不觉地已快到十二点了。在告辞的时候，我们祝贵宾们明天回国时一路平安，祝中波友谊像春天的花朵一样盛开在两国的大地上！
