Agricultural Anecdotes

　　Pear-Bearing Camphor Tree

　　In Tu’an Township, Nan’an, Fujian Province, a camphor tree has grown more than twenty wild pears for two consecutive years. In 1951, farmer Ye Shunzhen planted a wild pear tree about a zhang (3.3 meters) away from a hundred-year-old camphor tree. The wild pear tree grew slowly and never blossomed or bore fruit, but the camphor tree next to it blossomed in 1956 with many white flowers resembling pear blossoms, and later it bore more than twenty wild pears weighing one jin (0.5 kg) each. Last year, this camphor tree bore more than twenty wild pears again.

　　Sweet Orange Tree Bears Fruit Three Times a Year

　　A sweet orange tree belonging to farmer Lin Wanfang in Zhenyu Township, Yuechi County, Sichuan Province, bore fruit three times in one year. The first time, it blossomed and bore fruit at the same time as ordinary sweet oranges, producing seventy or eighty jin of fruit. The second time, it blossomed last summer and the fruit ripened in February this year, producing more than twenty jin of fruit. Except for slightly less juice and unfulfilled seeds, it was the same as ordinary sweet oranges. The third time, it blossomed last autumn, and the fruit is now the size of plums, with an estimated yield higher than the second time.

　　This tree has been planted for eighteen or nineteen years, growing vigorously with lush branches and leaves, with a yield of about one hundred jin in the past. This matter has aroused the interest of the local people, and they plan to study a method to greatly increase the yield of sweet oranges.

　　Hen Lays Eight Eggs in One Day

　　On March 28th, a hen belonging to Shanghai resident Tang Mingke laid eight eggs in a row, weighing about one jin, in two hours.

　　This hen, of the Subei breed, laid a total of more than two hundred eggs until October last year, more than twenty of which were double-yolked, each weighing more than four liang (0.2 kg); there were also eight times when it laid three eggs each time, including one time when there were two double-yolked and one single-yolked; in August last year, it even laid five eggs at one time, the weight being the same as before.

　　This hen laid five eggs at one time on March 21st, stopped for five days, and then laid three more eggs. Starting at six o'clock in the morning on the 28th, it laid eight large red-shelled eggs in a row within two hours, each egg being the same size as before.

　　Embryologist Zhu Xi, upon hearing this, expressed his willingness to incubate these eggs into chickens for research.

    樟树结梨
    福建省南安涂安乡的一棵樟树，连续两年各长了二十多个山梨。1951年，农民叶顺圳在距离一棵百年的樟树一丈左右的地方，种了一株山梨树，山梨树慢慢长大了，从未开花结果，而在它旁边的樟树却于1956年开出不少和梨花相似的白色花朵来，以后就结了二十多个一斤重的山梨。去年，这棵樟树又结了二十多个山梨。
    一年结三次甜橙
    四川岳池县镇裕乡农民林万芳的一株甜橙树，一年结了三次果。第一次，与一般甜橙同时开花结果，产果七、八十斤；第二次，去年夏季开花，果实在今年2月成熟，产果二十多斤，除果汁略少，种籽不饱米外，其他与一般甜橙相同；第三次，去年秋天开花，现在果实长得如李子般大小，估计产量比第二次高。
    这株树已栽了十八、九年，生长茁壮，枝叶繁茂，以往一季产量在一百斤左右。这件事引起了当地群众的兴趣，他们打算从中研究一种能大量增加甜橙产量的方法。
    一天生八只鸡蛋
    3月28日上海市居民唐明科家的一只老母鸡在两个小时内，一连生下了八只蛋，约重一斤。
    这只母鸡，是苏北种，到去年10月份，一共生了二百多只蛋，其中有二十多只是双黄蛋，每只重四两多；还有八次每次生了三只蛋，其中一次有两只双黄、一只单黄；去年8月里有一次竟生了五只蛋，重量和以前一样。
    这只鸡3月21日一次就生了五只蛋，停了五天，又生三只。28日清晨六时起，在两个钟头内，又接连生了八只红壳大鸡蛋，每只蛋和以前一样大。
    胚胎学家朱洗听到这事表示愿意把这些蛋代孵成鸡，进行研究。
