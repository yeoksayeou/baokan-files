Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 1st: Indonesian Army authorities announced today that government forces in Central Sumatra had recaptured Bangkinang four days ago and cleared out the rebels there. Bangkinang is sixty kilometers southwest of Pekanbaru and belongs to the West Sumatra region. West Sumatra is the main area occupied by the Hussein rebel group.

It was announced that government forces encountered no resistance and suffered no casualties during their advance.

Army spokesman Pienga Di announced that government forces on the southern front had also recaptured Sungai Lansat. It is an important road traffic center.

Army authorities revealed that a "minister" of the rebel group's so-called "revolutionary government," Simbolon, had been active in Lirik on March 14th, intending to flee abroad from there. However, due to the vigilance of the government law enforcement agencies, Simbolon's attempt did not succeed.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 1st: According to a report by Antara News Agency, the head of the Indonesian Army Information Service, Pienga Di, on March 31st, sternly refuted the following news released by the United Press International: Indonesian government forces sacrificed 350 paratroopers and assault troops in the military operations against the Central Sumatra rebel group. He said that this news was completely untrue. The government forces did not suffer any significant losses in the resolute military operations against the rebels in Central Sumatra.

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: According to a United Press International dispatch from Singapore on March 31st, the "Defense Minister" of the Central Sumatra rebel group in Indonesia, Masjumi party member Halharahap, admitted on March 31st that foreign aircraft are currently regularly airdropping weapons over Sumatra to the so-called "revolutionary government."

The report said that Halharahap refused to reveal the source of the weapons, but he said that the supply of these weapons was arranged through negotiations conducted in Singapore and Taipei.

On the same day, a United Press International reporter, in a dispatch from Bukittinggi, which was seized by the rebels, quoted another Masjumi party member, Muhammad Nasir, as saying that the rebel group had "no hope" and "no possibility" of reconciliation with the central government. He also said that he believed that Indonesia's reliance on two figures like President Sukarno and former Vice President Hatta was a mistake. Nasir left Jakarta for Central Sumatra before the rebel group established the so-called "revolutionary government." (Attached picture)

    印度尼西亚政府军直捣叛乱集团巢穴
    进入西苏门答腊收复班基南
    叛乱集团首要分子承认得到外国空投武器
    新华社雅加达1日电　印度尼西亚陆军当局今天宣布，在中苏门答腊的政府军已经在4日前收复班基南，并且肃清了那里的叛军。班基南在北干巴鲁的西南方六十公里，属于西苏门答腊地区。西苏门答腊是侯赛尼叛乱集团窃据的主要地区。
    据宣布，政府军在前进中没有遭到抵抗，也没有受到伤亡。
    陆军发言人皮恩加迪宣布，政府军在南方战线上还收复了双溪冷沙。它是一个重要的公路交通中心。
    陆军当局揭露，叛乱集团的所谓“革命政府”的一个“部长”西姆波朗曾经在3月14日到利里克活动，打算从那里逃到国外去。但是由于政府执法机关的警惕，西姆波朗的企图没有实现。
    新华社雅加达1日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚陆军新闻处处长皮恩加迪3月31日断然驳斥了美国合众社发出的下述消息：印度尼西亚政府军在对中苏门答腊叛乱集团采取的军事行动中牺牲了三百五十名伞兵和突击兵。他说，这条消息是完全不真实的。政府军在中苏门答腊对叛乱分子采取的坚决的军事行动中没有遭到任何重大损失。
    新华社1日讯　据合众社3月31日发自新加坡的一条消息报道，印度尼西亚中苏门答腊叛乱集团的“国防部长”、马斯友美党人哈拉哈普在3月31日承认，外国飞机目前正在定期地在苏门答腊上空空投武器给所谓“革命政府”。
    消息说，哈拉哈普拒绝说出武器的来源，但是他说，这些武器的供应是通过在新加坡和台北进行的谈判安排的。
    同一天，合众社记者发自叛乱分子窃据的武吉丁宜的一条消息，援引另一个马斯友美党人穆罕默德·纳席尔的话说，叛乱集团“没有希望”和“没有可能”同中央政府和解。他还说，他相信，印度尼西亚依靠像苏加诺总统和前副总统哈达这样两个人物的做法是错误的。纳席尔是在叛乱集团成立所谓“革命政府”之前离开雅加达到中苏门答腊的。（附图片）
