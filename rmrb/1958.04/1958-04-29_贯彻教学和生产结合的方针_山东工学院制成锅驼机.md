Shandong Institute of Technology Manufactures a Boiler-Traction Engine

(Xinhua News Agency) The Shandong Institute of Technology's practice factory recently successfully trial-produced a boiler-traction engine and has begun small-scale production.

The successfully trial-produced boiler-traction engine reaches a maximum speed of over 1,200 revolutions per minute. Its main component, the steam engine, is manufactured with great precision. The tolerance of the cylinder bore reaches a minimum of four threads, which is equal to four-sevenths of a human hair. It can use coal or charcoal as fuel, is simple to operate, and easy for farmers to learn and master.

Implementing the policy of combining teaching and production and combining theory and practice, the Shandong Institute of Technology also plans to trial-produce electric motors this year to support agricultural production.

    贯彻教学和生产结合的方针
    山东工学院制成锅驼机
    据新华社讯　山东工学院实习工厂最近试制锅驼机成功，并开始小批生产。
    试制成功的这台锅驼机，每分钟最高速度达到一千二百多转。它的主要部分蒸汽机制作很精密，汽缸体内径的公差达到最低数四丝，即等于一根头发的七分之四。它可以用煤或木炭等作燃料，操作简单，便于农民学习和掌握。
    山东工学院贯彻教学和生产相结合、理论和实际相结合的方针，今年还准备试制电动机，支援农业生产。
