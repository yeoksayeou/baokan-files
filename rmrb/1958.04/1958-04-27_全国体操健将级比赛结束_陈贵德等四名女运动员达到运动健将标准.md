National Gymnastics Master-Level Competition Concludes
Chen Guide and Four Other Female Athletes Reach the Master of Sport Standard

(Our dispatch) The 1958 National Gymnastics Master-Level Competition concluded yesterday after four days of intense competition.

Last night, before the closing ceremony, Kazazhayev and Korolev, technique athletes who came to China with the Russian gymnastics team, gave a wonderful technique performance.

As a result of the competition, Sichuan athlete Chen Guide won first place in the women's all-around with a score of 70.35, and Guangdong athlete Zheng Linxiang won first place in the men's all-around with a score of 98.5.

In this competition, a total of four female athletes' scores exceeded the Master of Sport standard of 70 points. They are: Chen Guide (72.35 points), Chen Xueyao (70.03 points), Chen Guili (70.15 points), and Yang Bozi (70.05 points). Chen Guide and Chen Guili are twin sisters, only eighteen years old this year, and have been practicing gymnastics for only two or three years. This time they achieved very good results and both became Masters of Sport. Female athletes Zhou Zhixiang, Zhu Lihua, and Men Xiaomin, who originally had hope of reaching the Master of Sport standard, all made mistakes in the optional exercises competition this time, and their scores did not reach the Master of Sport standard.

None of the male athletes participating in this competition reached the men's gymnastics Master of Sport standard of 104 points. Xia Dejun, an athlete from Liaoning Province, originally had high hopes, but because he did poorly on the pommel horse and horizontal bar in the optional exercises competition, he failed to meet the Master of Sport standard.

From this competition, it can be seen that these young gymnasts have made considerable progress. They have only been participating in gymnastics training for two or three years, and they are generally able to perform some relatively difficult movements. At the same time, it can also be seen from this competition that many gymnasts lack basic movement training, and therefore, they often cannot accurately complete the movements they perform in the competition. In addition, the technical development of athletes is not balanced enough. Many female athletes cannot pass the vault, and many male athletes cannot pass the horizontal bar. These problems should be paid attention to in future training.

### 全国体操健将级比赛结束  陈贵德等四名女运动员达到运动健将标准

    全国体操健将级比赛结束
    陈贵德等四名女运动员达到运动健将标准
    本报讯　1958年全国体操健将级比赛经过四天的紧张竞争，于昨日结束。
    昨晚在大会闭幕前，随俄罗斯体操队前来我国的技巧运动员卡札杰耶夫和科尔?夫作了精彩的技巧表演。
    比赛结果，四川运动员陈贵德以七○·三五分获得女子全能第一，广东运动员郑粦祥以九八·五分获得男子全能第一。
    在这次比赛中，共有四名女运动员的成绩超过了健将级七○分的标准。她们是：陈贵德（七二·三五分）、陈雪瑶（七○·三分）、陈贵立（七○·一五分）、杨波紫
  （七○·○五分）。陈贵德和陈贵立是孪生姊妹，今年才十八岁，练习体操不过二三年，这次她们取得很好的成绩，双双成了运动健将。原来有希望达到健将标准的女运动员周芷湘、朱利亚、门晓敏等，这次都因为在自选动作比赛中，动作有失误，得分都未达到健将级标准。
    参加这次比赛的男运动员都没有达到一○四分的男子体操健将级标准。辽宁省运动员夏德君本来很有希望，但因为他在作自选动作比赛中，在鞍马和单杠上都做得不好，而没能通过健将标准。
    从这次比赛，可以看出这些年青的体操运动员都有不小的进步。他们参加体操锻炼都不过二三年的时间，一般都已能做一些难度比较大的动作。同时，从这次比赛也看出，很多体操运动员的基本动作训练差，因而，在比赛中常常不能准确地完成所作的动作。另外，运动员的技术的发展也不够平衡。有很多女运动员过不了跳跃这一关，很多男运动员过不了单杠这一关。这些问题都是应该在今后训练中引起注意的。
