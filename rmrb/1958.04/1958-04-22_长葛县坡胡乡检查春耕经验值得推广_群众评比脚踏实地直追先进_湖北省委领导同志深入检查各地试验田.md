	Changge County, Po Hu Township's Experience in Spring Ploughing Inspection is Worth Promoting
	Masses Compare, Remain Grounded, Directly Pursuing Advanced Practices
	Hubei Provincial Party Committee Leaders Conduct In-depth Inspections of Experimental Fields in Various Regions

	(Reported by this newspaper) The CCP Po Hu Township Committee of Changge County, Henan Province, in the spring plowing and sowing, used the forms of big blooming, big contending, and big-character posters to carry out mass production inspections, reversed the complacency and slackness, and powerfully promoted the current production.

	Before the large-scale inspection, the vast majority of cadres in this township, simply satisfied with the achievements in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements since last winter, satisfied that this year's wheat seedlings were growing better than in previous years, and that the vast majority of spring-sown land had been deeply plowed to more than one and a half feet, all believed that "a bumper harvest was in hand", and generally produced the idea of wanting to rest. The labor attendance rate of each cooperative generally declined, and the phenomenon of neglecting the quality of agricultural work also occurred.

	After discovering the above situation, the CCP Po Hu Township Committee immediately checked its leadership methods in connection with the Township Party Committee, and believed that the main reason for this phenomenon was: the lack of mass inspection and supervision work. Therefore, although the Township Party Committee had raised the issue of preventing and overcoming complacency and paralysis more than once, and sometimes even publicly named and criticized, the effect was not great.

	In order to reverse this situation, the CCP Po Hu Township Committee immediately launched a mass production inspection and evaluation throughout the township. The method was to first select representatives from each cooperative, led by the main responsible cadres of the Township Party Committee, to visit each cooperative, village, and team separately, and then to deliberate and debate by cooperative, and to launch big-character posters. A total of eighty-five people participated in this visit and inspection, and nine hundred and ninety-six big-character posters were posted, of which more than 97% belonged to mutual praise and criticism between cooperatives and teams. According to the original reports of each cooperative, 5,004 mu of spring-sown land had been deeply plowed. After this blooming and inspection, it was found that more than 800 mu were plowed shallowly and needed to be reworked; 1,200 mu had too little base fertilizer applied, which did not meet the requirements of the Township Party Committee; According to the reports, there were originally only 364 mu of third-class wheat fields, but after inspection, it was found that there were actually 840 mu. The Ninth Cooperative, which had reported to the Township Party Committee that it had achieved three "one hundred percent" (wheat field watering and fertilization, elimination of third-class wheat, spring plowing of deeply plowed land), found many problems after block-by-block inspection. One big-character poster criticized: "Your cooperative's Second Team is really outstanding, there is a wheat field in the southwest, only hoeing both ends, the wheat seedlings in the middle are crying from drought. There are also twelve mu of corn, reporting a deep plowing of one foot five inches, but in reality, it is less than four inches five, how can this convince people!" Those cooperatives that were doing well in production were praised at the same time. The cooperative and team cadres who were criticized wrote big-character posters to conduct self-criticism, and some said that they would work hard and strive to change from backward to advanced as soon as possible. On the basis of this inspection, each cooperative also carried out team-by-team and household-by-household evaluations based on the content of "ten comparisons", and generally formulated plans for labor attendance and specific operations. Thus, a movement to catch up with and surpass the advanced, centered on spring production, was universally launched throughout the township. In more than ten days, the wheat fields have generally reached "three fertilizers, three waterings", and are now applying the fourth fertilizer; the township has basically eliminated the third-class wheat fields. Each cooperative has established a strict inspection and acceptance system, and has implemented fixed labor, fixed draft animals, fixed quality, fixed fertilizer, fixed seeds, fixed work points, and stipulated specific farming requirements. Township and cooperative cadres go deep into the fields, working and inspecting at the same time.

	In order to better discover problems in a timely manner, the CCP Po Hu Township Committee has decided to regard the regular organization of mass production inspections as an important method for organizing and promoting work in the future. (Kan Feng)

	(Reported by this newspaper) Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the CCP Hubei Provincial Committee, led experts deep into the fields to inspect spring plowing and sowing and the growth of summer harvest crops.

	From the 14th to the 19th, Wang Renzhong and the relevant personnel he led focused on inspecting the production situation of some townships and cooperatives under the Jingzhou Prefectural Committee, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee, and the Fenghuang Township of Jiangling County, and the Dakou Township of Songzi County. The inspection was conducted through "experimental fields" because the "experimental fields" in various places can generally represent the production situation in various regions.

	The inspection shows that planting "experimental fields" has become a good trend among cadres at all levels, and most "experimental fields" have indeed become the banner of local production, and cadres have begun to embark on the road of being both red and expert. The Victory No. 1 rapeseed planted in the "experimental field" of the cadres of Dakou Township, Songzi County, is as tall as a person, and it is estimated that each mu can yield more than 300 jin. The many wheat "experimental fields" inspected can generally yield 700 jin per mu, or even more than 1,000 jin. However, the inspection also revealed many problems that need to be solved urgently. For example, in terms of wheat, the common problem is that the seedlings are sparsely sown, which greatly affects the harvest. The wheat planted in the "experimental field" of the Jingmen County cadres has an average of only 200,000 plants per mu, but according to advanced experience, strip planting and close planting can increase this by more than one time; if enough fertilizer is applied, this item alone can increase the yield by more than one time. The inspection also found that some places were sowing cotton in rapeseed fields with rapeseed in full bloom, which collapsed many rapeseed plants and made it impossible to apply base fertilizer. If nutrient pots are used, this problem can be solved. There are also some "experimental fields" with high planning but poor measures. During the inspection, the leaders quickly opened up the cadres' thinking and solved the problem through the method of leading cadres inspecting, studying, and solving problems with cadres in relevant areas.

	During the inspection, Wang Renzhong especially emphasized that leaders at all levels must effectively implement the policy that politics is in command and grasp political and ideological work well. At the same time, he repeatedly emphasized that increasing production should be taken as the center, and production should drive everything, and various tasks should not be carried out in parallel. Leaders at all levels must learn to use the method of typical leadership in general. When learning from typical examples, they should humbly learn from the experience of other places, but it is more important to pay attention to summarizing the typical experiences of their own township and cooperative, because local experiences can be promoted more quickly and in a timely manner.

    长葛县坡胡乡检查春耕经验值得推广
    群众评比脚踏实地直追先进
    湖北省委领导同志深入检查各地试验田
    本报讯　中共河南省长葛县坡胡乡委员会在春耕播种中，运用大鸣大放大字报的形式，开展群众性的生产大检查，扭转了自满松气思想，有力地推动了当前生产。
    在大检查前，这乡绝大部分干部，由于单纯满足于去冬以来水利、积肥运动中的成绩，满足于今年麦苗长得比那年都好，春播土地绝大部分都深翻达一尺半以上，都认为“丰收在握”，普遍产生了想歇一歇的思想。各社的劳动出勤率普遍下降，忽视农活质量的现象也有发生。
    中共坡胡乡委员会发现上述情况后，立即联系乡党委会的领导方法进行了检查，认为造成这种现象的主要原因是：没有开展群众性的检查和监督工作。因而乡党委虽然不只一次地提出要防止和克服自满麻痹情绪，有时甚至公开指名批评，但收效不大。
    为了扭转这种情况，中共坡胡乡委员会立即在全乡范围内开展了一次群众性的生产检查和评比。方法是首先由各社选派代表，由乡党委的主要负责干部带领，分头逐社、逐村、逐队进行参观，然后再以社为单位进行酝酿，展开鸣放、辩论，并发动贴大字报。参加这次参观检查的共八十五人，贴出大字报九百九十六张，其中97％以上是属于各社、队之间互相表扬和批评的。全乡原来按照各社汇报，已深翻春播土地五千零四亩，经过这次鸣放检查，发现有八百多亩翻的浅；需要返工；有一千二百亩底肥施的少，没有达到乡党委的要求；根据汇报三类麦田原来只有三百六十四亩，检查发现，实际还有八百四十亩。原来曾经向乡党委会汇报做到了三个“百分之百”（麦田浇水施肥，消灭三类麦，春耕深翻地）的第九社，经过逐块检查，发现问题很多。有一张大字报上批评说：“你社二队真突出，西南地里有块麦，当中不锄两头锄，中间的麦苗旱的哭。还有玉米十二亩，汇报深翻一尺五，实际还不到四寸五，这样怎能叫人心中服！”那些生产搞得好的社，同时都受到了表扬。受到批评的农业社的社、队干部，有的写大字报进行自我检讨，有的表示一定要苦干，争取尽快把落后变先进。在这次检查基础上，各社又都根据“十比”的内容，开展了逐队和逐户的评比，普遍制订劳动出勤和具体作业的计划，于是一个以春季生产为中心的赶先进、比先进运动，便在全乡普遍展开了。在十多天的时间里，麦田已经普遍达到了“三肥、三水”，现在又正在施第四遍肥；全乡已基本上消灭了第三类麦田。各社都建立了严格的检查验收制度，实行了定劳力，定耕畜，定质量，定肥料，定种籽，定工分，规定了具体的耕作要求。乡、社干部都深入田间，边劳动，边检查。
    为了更好地及时发现问题，中共坡胡乡委员会已决定将定期组织群众性的生产大检查，当作今后组织推动工作的一项重要方法。　（阚枫）
    本报讯　中共湖北省委第一书记王任重带领专家深入田间检查春耕播种和夏收作物生长情况。
    从14日到19日，王任重同志所率领的有关人员有重点的检查了荆州地委、襄阳地委和江陵县凤凰乡、松滋县大路口乡等一些乡、社的生产情况。检查是通过“试验田”进行的，因为各地“试验田”大体可以代表各地区的生产情况。
    在检查中表明，种“试验田”已成了各级干部的良好风气，大多数“试验田”确实成了当地生产的旗帜，干部开始走上了又红又专的道路。松滋县大路口乡干部“试验田”里种的胜利号油菜，长得有一人高，估计每亩也可收三百斤以上。所检查的许多小麦“试验田”，一般每亩可收七百斤，甚至一千多斤。但是，检查中也发现不少急待解决的问题。例如在小麦方面，普遍存在的问题是撒播苗稀，大大影响了收成。荆门县干部“试验田”种的麦子，平均每亩只有二十几万株，但按照先进经验实行条播、密植，每亩可以比这增加一倍以上；如果把肥料施足，仅这一项就可使产量增加一倍以上。在检查中，还发现有些地方在菜花盛开的油菜地里播种棉花，这样既倒塌了许多油菜，又无法施底肥。如果改用营养钵，这个问题就可解决。还有一些“试验田”的规划高，但措施差。在检查中，通过领导干部同有关地区干部边检查、边研究、边解决的办法，很快打通了干部的思想，解决了问题。
    在检查中，王任重同志特别强调各级领导必须切实贯彻政治是统帅的方针，抓好政治思想工作。同时反复强调指出：把增产作为中心，以生产带动一切，切不可把各项工作齐头并进。各级领导要学会运用典型领导一般的方法。在学习典型时，要虚心学习外地经验，但更重要的是注意总结本乡本社的典型经验，因为本地的经验更能迅速及时地推广。　（波海）
