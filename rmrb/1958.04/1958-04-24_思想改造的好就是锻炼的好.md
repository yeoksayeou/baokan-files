    Good Ideological Remolding Means Good Exercise
    I believe that Comrade Yu Zhiming's view of considering labor training as the only method to remold intellectuals is not comprehensive. Because, if labor training is regarded as the "only" method to remold intellectuals, it actually excludes the existence of other methods. Such a view does not conform to objective reality. Aren't many of our senior responsible cadres and state leaders also intellectuals from the exploiting classes? They probably haven't all participated in three to five years of labor training, but can it be said that they haven't been remolded? I don't think so. This fact shows that a long and arduous revolutionary struggle life can remold intellectuals. In the cruel struggle against the enemy, in the enemy's courts and prisons, a revolutionary cadre can also be trained and tested. Perhaps some people will retort that this was the situation in the past, and now it is a period of peaceful construction. It is true that it is currently a period of peaceful construction. However, even in the current situation, labor cannot be said to be the only method of remolding intellectuals, but only a basic, effective method permitted by current domestic conditions. In addition to this, isn't sending cadres to work at the grassroots level, to train in practice, also a method of remolding intellectuals?
    Regarding the criteria for good or bad labor training, I also disagree with the view that more labor and more work points equal good training. I believe that everyone's health is different, and their strength is also different. Some have some common sense about farm work, while others have never even seen it. This results in great differences in mastering farming techniques and completing the intensity and quality of specific work: some comrades can do the work of a full laborer, the average can only do the work of a half laborer, and some are even inferior to women and children. Therefore, it is not comprehensive or practical to judge the quality of a cadre's labor training solely from the work points earned. Of course, doing more, doing faster, and doing better is indeed a gratifying phenomenon, but it can never be the standard for measuring the quality of labor training for transferred cadres.
    So, what criteria should be used to measure the quality of labor training for transferred cadres?
    I think it should be viewed from the following aspects:
    First, it is necessary to see whether his understanding of sent-down cadres and labor training is correct;
    Second, it is necessary to see whether his attitude towards work is diligent; whether he is good at learning from farmers with an open mind and consciously remolding himself;
    Third, it is necessary to see whether he can actively participate in various social activities of the cooperative and whether he can care for and safeguard the interests of the cooperative.
    In short, a transferred cadre who can work hard, humbly learn from farmers, actively participate in social activities, and have significant changes in ideological remolding is considered to have good labor training. Otherwise, even if the individual works well and earns a lot of work points, but is indifferent to matters other than labor, then it cannot be considered good labor training.

### 思想改造的好就是锻炼的好

    思想改造的好就是锻炼的好
    我认为余志明同志把劳动锻炼看做是改造知识分子的唯一方法的观点是不全面的。因为，假若把劳动锻炼看做是改造知识分子的“唯一”方法，那么实际上就排斥了其它方法的存在。这样看是不符合客观情况的。我们有许多高级负责干部和国家领导人不也是出身于剥削阶级的知识分子吗？他们恐怕也未必个个都参加过三年到五年的劳动锻炼，但这能说他们没有得到改造吗？我想是不能的。这一事实说明，长期的、艰苦的革命斗争生活可以改造知识分子。在残酷的对敌斗争中，在敌人的法庭上和监牢里也一样能锻炼和考验一个革命干部。也许有人会反驳我说，这是过去的情况了，目前是和平建设时期。不错，目前确实是和平建设时期。但即是在目前的情况下，劳动也不能说成是改造知识分子的独一无二的方法，而只能是一种基本的、为目前国内条件所许可的、又行之有效的方法。除此以外，派干部到基层去工作，去实际中锻炼，不也同样是改造知识分子的方法吗？
    对于劳动锻炼好坏的标准问题，我也不同意多劳动、多得工分就是锻炼的好的观点。我认为每个人的健康状况不一样，气力大小也不同，有的对干农活有些常识，有的根本连见也没有见过。这样在掌握农活的技术及完成具体工作的强度和质量上便有很大差别：有的同志可以顶一个全劳力干活，一般的只能顶一个半劳力干活，有的连妇女小孩还不如。因此，如果只从干活所得工分上来看一个人劳动锻炼的好坏那是不全面不实际的。固然干的多，干的快，干的好，确是可喜的现象，但它也绝不能成为衡量下放干部劳动锻炼好坏的标准。
    那么究竟应该用什么标准来衡量下放干部劳动锻炼的好坏呢？
    我认为应从以下几个方面来看：
    一、要看他对下放干部，劳动锻炼的认识是否正确；
    二、要看他干活的态度是否努力；是否善于虚心向农民学习，自觉地改造自己；
    三、要看他是否能积极参加合作社的各项社会活动，能否关心和维护社的利益。
    总之，一个下放干部只要能努力劳动，虚心地向农民学习，积极参加社会活动，并在思想改造上有显著转变的即是劳动锻炼的好。否则尽管个人劳动好，工分挣的多，而对劳动以外的事情则漠不关心，那就算不上劳动锻炼的好。
