Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 3rd: According to recent measurements by the Guangzhou Municipal Product Quality Inspection Institute, the discharge time of the Peace, Guangzhou, and Xingguang brand batteries produced in Guangzhou all exceeded one thousand minutes, while the famous American Ever Ready brand battery only lasted eight hundred and forty minutes.

These three brands of batteries are all products of the Guangzhou Battery Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Guangzhou. Since the year before last, the quality of the factory's batteries has been continuously improving. Especially after the launch of the "Double Anti" movement, the discharge time of the batteries rapidly jumped from over six hundred minutes to over eight hundred minutes. In early March of this year, the factory submitted Guangzhou and Peace brand batteries to the national battery discharge time competition among ten factories, winning first and second place respectively. The quality has reached an advanced international level. Now, the discharge time of the batteries has broken through the one thousand minute mark.

Now, the factory has put forward a new goal: to achieve a battery discharge time of 1,200 minutes and a shelf life of two years this year.

    放电一千分钟
    广州三种电池胜过美国名牌货
    据新华社广州3日电　根据广州市产品质量检验所最近的测定，广州市出产的和平、广州和新光牌电池的放电时间，都超过了一千分钟，而著名的美国永备牌电池只有八百四十分钟。
    这三种牌号的电池，都是广州市地方国营广州电池厂的产品。这个厂自前年以来，电池的质量不断提高。特别是开展双反运动后，电池的放电时间从六百多分钟迅速跃进到八百多分钟。这个厂在今年3月初，把广州牌、和平牌电池参加了全国十个工厂电池放电时间评比大会，获得冠军和亚军，质量已达到国际上先进的水平。现在电池的放电时间突破了一千分钟大关。
    现在这个厂又提出新的奋斗目标，要求今年内电池放电时间达到一千二百分钟，保险期达到两年。
