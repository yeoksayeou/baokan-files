Several Methods for Striking Artesian Wells in Baoding Special District
　　Zhang Hua
　　Baoding Special District is located in the central plain of Hebei Province, bordering the Taihang Mountains to the west and Baiyang Lake to the east. The terrain slopes from west to east. The near-mountain areas mostly have yellow sandy soil with many underground gravel layers and thin, permeable surface layers, making it easy for water to seep through. The special district's average annual rainfall reaches 500 millimeters, and the rainfall is relatively abundant. Every year during the rainy season, in addition to a large amount of surface water flowing down along mountain valleys and rivers, much rainwater also seeps into the underground currents, forming abundant underground water sources. Last winter, the Baoding District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the above water source conditions, proposed digging a large number of artesian wells. As of April 14, the entire special district had dug, excavated, and bored over 3,300 artesian wells, with a total water output of 71 cubic meters per second.
　　When this special district began digging artesian wells, it adopted the following methods based on the different local conditions.
　　Blasting Mountains and Quarrying Stone to Carve Mountain Springs
　　This method is suitable for deep mountain areas. To open such a spring, one must first find the spring source. When looking for the spring source, one must observe the rock type, the terrain, and the plants. Generally, places with continuous undulating mountains, lush vegetation with strong drought resistance and cold resistance, rocks inclined to one side, three mountains surrounding a depression, or small caves along riverbeds at the foot of mountains with year-round dripping water, and high mountains upstream, appearing like steam when viewed from a distance in the morning, are likely to contain underground currents. After surveying and selecting a suitable location, one can blast the mountain and quarry stone to excavate. After discovering a spring, expanding and deepening the cave opening can create an artesian well. Expanding and deepening existing small springs, and repairing silted springs can also increase the flow. The Baoding Special District has used the above methods to open and carve over 1,200 mountain springs.
　　Drilling Artesian Wells in Water Reservoirs
　　In near-mountain areas, any depression between the 35 and 40 meter contour lines can be used to dig water reservoirs and bore artesian wells. Because the groundwater level is shallow in these places, the underground is mostly permeable layers of sand and gravel, the groundwater level upstream is high, the pressure is high, and the downstream slope is large, generally boring a well can cause it to flow freely. In this special district, Ding County, Zhuo County, Xushui, Mancheng and other places have utilized the natural terrain to dig and bore over 1,500 artesian wells. The water output of these scattered small artesian wells in Ding County alone exceeds 10 cubic meters per second. Ding County has used these water sources to build canals and sluice gates, converting 200,000 mu of dry land into self-irrigated paddy fields.
　　To dig an artesian well in a water reservoir, one must first select a good location. Water reservoir artesian wells should generally be dug upstream of the depression, and the location should be perpendicular to the direction of underground water flow, to cut off the flow of underground water and allow the upstream underground water to flow into the water reservoir. Water reservoir artesian wells are best dug in a rectangular shape, increasing the cross-sectional area to cut off the underground water, which can increase the water source. The area of water reservoir artesian wells is generally 200 to 500 meters long and 10 to 20 meters wide, and the bottom should be dug 1 to 2 meters below the groundwater level to prevent drying up during the dry season. When digging this type of artesian well, it is best to dig it all at once to prevent the groundwater level from rising and increasing construction difficulties. In large depressions, water reservoir artesian well clusters can also be dug in a staggered manner to converge the spring water and increase the flow. After the water reservoir artesian well is dug, an outlet should be dug and a sluice gate built according to the terrain and canal layout to control water use in a planned manner.
　　To increase the water volume of this type of artesian well, pipes can also be inserted into the middle of the water reservoir to bore wells. When inserting the pipes to bore wells, the arrangement of the well pipes is best perpendicular to the direction of underground water flow, and both deep and shallow wells should be used.
　　Intercepting Subsurface Flow Along Rivers
　　One method is to use depressions on the outside of the riverbank at river bends to dig pits and ponds to open springs. Because when the river channel changes direction, the water flows through the original direction and seeps into the underground sand layer on the opposite bank, digging a pit in the direction of the water flow can bring the subsurface flow to the surface, turning underground water into an artesian well. Another method is to directly dig out the subsurface flow. Transversely excavate deeply in the old riverbed, clearing out the accumulated pebbles and silt, and then filling it with impermeable clay. This can also cut off the underground water, causing the groundwater level to rise, and turning the subsurface flow into surface flow through the dug-out outlet pit.
　　Digging Pit Springs
　　Many pits and ponds in near-mountain areas that do not dry up all year round may have water springs underneath. Last winter, the Baoding Special District deeply excavated pits and ponds to accumulate fertilizer and dug out many water springs. The Baicheng Commune in Qingyuan County renovated a pit and pond and dug out enough water to irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land.

    保定专区打自流泉的几种办法
    张华
    保定专区地处河北省中部平原，西靠太行山，东邻白洋淀，地形由西向东倾斜。近山地区多系黄沙土壤，地下沙砾石层多，地表透水层薄，容易透水。这个专区的常年平均降雨量，共达五百公厘，雨量也比较充沛。每年雨季，除大量地上水沿山谷河道下泄外，还有许多雨水渗透到地下潜流，形成充沛的地下水源。中共保定地委去冬根据上述水源条件，提出大量凿打自流泉。截至4月14日，全专区已凿、挖、锥出自流泉三千三百多处，出水量共达七十一秒公方。
    这个专区开始挖自流泉时，根据当地的不同情况，采取了以下几种办法。
    崩山开石凿山泉
    这种办法适用于深山区。开凿这种泉首先要找出泉苗。寻找泉苗时要看石性、看地形、看植物。一般具有山势起伏连绵，草木茂盛抗旱御寒能力较强，岩石向一面倾斜，三山夹一洼或沿河道山脚下有小洞常年滴水、上游又有高山群环、早晨远望似蒸气等象征的地方，即可能藏有潜流。经过勘察，选择好地址，就可崩山开石凿挖。待发现泉眼再扩大凿深洞口，就能开出自流泉。如果将旧有小泉凿深扩大，修复淤淀的水泉，也可增大泉流。保定专区利用上述办法已开山凿泉一千二百多处。
    凿水柜自流泉
    在近山地区凡在等高线三十五至四十公尺之间的洼地，都可挖水柜锥打自流泉。因这些地方地下水位浅，地下多是沙卵石的透水层，上游地下水位高，压力大，下游坡度又大，一般锥泉即可自流。这个专区定县、涿县、徐水、满城等地，利用自然地形已挖锥了一千五百多处自流泉。这些分散小型的自流泉，仅定县一县的出水量，就超过了十秒公方。定县利用这些水源开渠建闸，已把二十万亩旱地改为自流灌溉的稻田。
    挖水柜自流泉，也要先选好地址。水柜自流泉一般应挖在洼地上游，位置并应与地下水流方向垂直，以切断地下水的流向，使上游的地下水注入水柜。水柜自流泉最好挖成长方形，将地下水的切断面增大，这样能加大水源。水柜自流泉面积一般长二至五百公尺，宽十至二十公尺，底深要挖过地下水位一两公尺，以防枯水期干涸。这种自流泉在挖掘时，最好一气挖好，以防地下水位上升，增加施工困难。大片洼地，还可交错挖掘水柜自流泉群汇流泉水，增大流量。水柜自流泉挖成后，再根据地形渠道布置情况，挖出水口，修筑闸门，有计划的控制用水。
    为增加这种自流泉的水量，还可在水柜当中下管锥泉。在下管锥泉时，泉管排列最好横切地下水流方向，并且深浅兼用。
      沿河截潜流
    一个办法是在河流转弯处河堤外边，利用洼地挖坑塘开泉。因河道转方向时，水流通过原来方向潜入对岸地下沙层，在迎水流的地方掘坑，即能把潜流挖出来，将地下水变为自流泉。另一个办法是直接挖潜流。在故河道横切深挖，清出淤积的卵石、泥沙，然后再填好不透水的胶泥。这样也可切断地下水，使地下水位上升，通过挖好的出水坑，变潜流为明流。
      挖掘坑泉
    近山地区许多历年不干的坑塘下面都可能有水泉。保定专区去冬深挖坑塘积肥，挖出了许多水泉。清苑县白城社改造了一个坑塘，即挖出了可浇一万多亩地的水量。
