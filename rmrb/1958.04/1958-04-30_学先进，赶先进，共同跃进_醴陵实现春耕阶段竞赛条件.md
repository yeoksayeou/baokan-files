Learning from the Advanced, Catching Up with the Advanced, Advancing Together
    Liling Achieves Spring Planting Competition Conditions
    (Our report) Eight hundred and fifteen agricultural cooperatives in Liling County, Hunan Province, have successfully completed rice transplanting, fulfilling the spring planting stage of the competition challenge to agricultural cooperatives in Xiaogan and Hongan Counties, Hubei Province. According to inspections by various townships, the various farming tasks and cultivation techniques completed by each agricultural cooperative this year have greatly improved compared to the past. In the past, Liling farmers were not accustomed to close planting, but this year close planting has been widely promoted. Each mu (unit of area, approximately 0.16 acres) has been planted with 10,000 to 20,000 more rice seedlings than last year; in the past, plowing was only two inches deep, but this year it has been universally deepened to four and a half inches, and the number of plowing and harrowing passes has also increased; in terms of variety matching, one season of late japonica rice, sweet potatoes, radishes, vegetables, and autumn miscellaneous crops have been added, implementing multiple plowing and rotation to cultivate soil fertility. In addition, experiments are being conducted to cultivate strong old seedlings for planting double-cropping rice in wheat fields, so that an extra wheat harvest can be obtained. This year, all 600,000 mu of farmland in the county are irrigated by gravity, ensuring water supply without fear of drought or flood. In addition, more than 120,000 mu of low-yield fields have been improved, and diversified operations have been carried out, generating 1.72 million yuan in cash income in just over two months.
    Liling is a famous double-cropping rice producing area with a history of over 800 years, and the farmers have rich farming experience. In 1953, Xiaogan County in Hubei Province also came to Liling to learn the experience of planting double-cropping rice. However, last year, Xiaogan County, located north of the Yangtze River, achieved a grain yield of 1,000 jin (unit of weight, approximately 0.5 kg) per mu, which shocked the farmers of Liling. Soon, the Liling County Committee of the Communist Party of China organized several visiting groups to Xiaogan, Hongan, Macheng, and other counties to observe and learn many advanced experiences, and went to Jiangxi to learn about improving red soil and summarize the lessons learned from insufficient deep plowing and close planting in the past. After the rectification movement in the countryside, all farmers and cadres in the county are full of confidence in achieving a "thousand-jin county" this year. In January of this year, they proposed a revolutionary friendship competition to Xiaogan, Hongan, and other counties. This initiative was immediately responded to by the other parties, especially the competition between Liling and Xiaogan, which was in full swing. For example, when Liling County learned that Xiaogan County had prepared 50 jin of chemical fertilizer and 80 jin of cake fertilizer per mu, the fertilizer accumulation work of each agricultural cooperative immediately became tense. Zhao Jiande, the first secretary of the County Party Committee, personally went to the front line to lead the fertilizer accumulation campaign, and vigorously promoted Xiaogan County's advanced experience of accumulating fertilizer frequently using cow-tail stoves. In this way, inspired by the revolutionary enthusiasm of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and competing with the advanced, the amount of fertilizer accumulated by farmers throughout the county increased sharply from an average of 385 dan (unit of weight, approximately 50 kg) per mu to 1,390 dan in less than 20 days. When Wangxian Township promoted deep plowing and close planting, Huang Quansheng, the secretary of the township party branch, took out a densely planted rice seedling and a line of rice ears he brought back from Xiaogan, Hubei, for exhibition. This rice seedling had more than 40 roots, and each ear had more than 180 grains, which quickly broke the farmers' conservative idea that "dense rice does not produce grains." As a result, close planting was implemented throughout the township this year. Now the movement is developing in depth. In addition to strengthening the field management of early rice, they plan to increase the fertilizer accumulation for double-cropping rice to 2,000 dan per mu. The county has put forward a new fighting slogan: Catch up with Xiaogan, surpass Hongan, and strive for a total grain output of 1,500 jin per mu in the county.

    醴陵实现春耕阶段竞赛条件
    本报讯　湖南省醴陵县八百一十五个农业社已胜利完成插秧，圆满地实现了春耕阶段向湖北孝感、红安等县农业社挑战的竞赛条件。根据各乡检查，各农业社完成的各项农活和耕作技术，今年都较从前有很大改进。过去醴陵农民插秧不习惯密植，今年普遍推广密植。每亩比去年要增植一万至两万蔸禾；过去是犁地二寸多深，今年普遍深耕到四点五寸，犁耙次数也增加了；在品种搭配上增加一季晚粳、红薯、萝卜、蔬菜和秋杂等作物，实行多次翻耕轮种，以培养地力。另外，还试验培育老壮秧在小麦田里再种双季稻，这样，就可多收一季小麦。今年全县六十多万亩农田都是自流灌溉，水旱无忧。此外还改良低产田十二万余亩，开展了多种经营，两个多月即收入现金一百七十二万元。
    醴陵是一个有着八百多年历史的著名双季稻产区，农民耕作经验丰富，1953年湖北孝感等县也曾在醴陵学习过种植双季稻的经验。但去年，这个地处长江以北的孝感县实现了粮食亩产千斤县，消息传出后，立即震撼了醴陵农民，不久中共醴陵县委即先后几次组织参观团到孝感和红安、麻城等县观摩学习了许多先进经验，并去江西学习改良红土壤和总结出过去在深耕密植等方面做得不够的教训。农村经过整风后，全县农民和干部都信心百倍地要在今年实现千斤县，并在今年1月向孝感、红安等县提出革命友谊竞赛。这个倡议提出后，立即得到对方的响应，特别是醴陵与孝感之间竞赛的锣鼓打得很响。例如醴陵县有次打听到孝感县每亩已准备五十斤化肥和八十斤饼肥时，各农业社的积肥工作立即紧张起来，县委第一书记赵建德亲自深入现场领导积肥运动，并大力推广孝感县用牛尾灶经常积肥的先进经验。这样，全县农民在学先进、赶先进、比先进的革命热情鼓舞下，不到二十天，积肥数量即由每亩平均三百八十五担激增到一千三百九十担。王仙乡在推广深耕密植时，乡党总支书记黄泉生把他从湖北孝感参观带回一个密植的禾蔸和一线稻穗拿出展览，这个禾蔸有四十多根，每穗结谷一百八十多粒，很快打破了农民“密禾不结谷”的保守思想，结果全乡今年都实行了密植。现在运动正向深处发展，他们除加强早稻田间管理外，计划双季稻每亩肥料要增积到二千担，全县提出新的奋斗口号是：赶上孝感，赛过红安，为全县亩产一千五百斤粮食而努力。
