    Literature Teachers Should Improve Teaching Language

    Last month, writers raised the issue of "improving writing style," wanting to make the writing style "coordinate with the vigorous new society." As middle school literature teachers, we can't help but think of the issue of improving teaching language when we hear this news, because cliché exists in our teaching language.

    The most obvious manifestation of cliché in teaching language is: too many technical terms. Just take our students as an example, they can already be called an infinite source of technical terms. For example, a student fluently answered the teacher's question, saying: "This is an article with populism and realism. Mainly because the author shaped a typical character, and the expressive techniques are diverse. As for the style, it is also very unique." It is precisely because they are familiar with these words that they copy them out in this way. But they know very little about what it actually means.

    Not accessible; using many technical terms that students don't understand, but not being accessible also has other "styles." For example, when we introduce Xin Qiji, there is a passage that says: "Xin Jiaxuan's life aspirations were not fulfilled in any way, and he devoted his entire life to the creation of poetry, achieving extremely high attainments. He can write about grand and upright aspirations, and also write about lingering and touching emotions. In addition, in terms of manipulating language, the poet can break traditional conventions, innovate, use language freely, and demonstrate a high degree of talent." Isn't this just like a spell to students!

    Redundant material; the redundant material mentioned here refers to topics for which materials can be found, such as introducing writers like Li Bai and Lu Xun, and introducing works like the Book of Songs and Dream of the Red Chamber, often saying too much. Because time is limited, we have to speak quickly to say more. After listening, students will naturally have places they don't understand, and they won't be able to remember the key points of what they do understand. In class, they only feel dazzled, and after class, they feel lost.

    Based on the above three points, the cliché in our teaching language is very serious.

    To serve students, we must speak in a way that students can understand, and we should try our best to make students like to listen and easy to remember. I hope that middle school literature teachers will take improving teaching language and opposing cliché as one of the contents of our rectification campaign.

### 文学教师应改进教学语言

    文学教师应改进教学语言
    上个月，作家们提出了“改进文风”问题，要让文风“跟朝气勃勃的新社会配合起来”。我们作中等学校文学教师的听到这个消息，禁不住想到教学语言的改进问题，因为八股腔在我们的教学语言中是存在着的。
    教学语言中的八股腔，最明显的表现在：术语多，就从我们的学生身上说吧，他们就已经称得起术语无穷了。例如有个学生流畅地回答教师的提问说：“这是一篇具有人民性和现实性的文章。主要由于作者塑造了典型性格，并且表现手法多种多样。至于风格，也是非常别致的。”正因为他们听熟了这样的话，所以才如此地复制出来。但究竟如何，他们知道得很少。
    不通俗；使用学生不懂的许多术语，但不通俗还有别种“风格”。如我们在介绍辛弃疾时有一段话道：“辛稼轩生平志愿，百无一酬，毕生专力于词的创作，造诣极深。他能写雄奇磊落的怀抱，也能写缠绵悱恻的情思。另外，在驾驭语言方面，诗人能打破传统旧例，推陈出新，挥洒自如，表现了高度的天才。”难道这对于学生说，还不是咒语吗！
    材料冗，这里所说的材料冗，是指有材料可寻的课题，例如介绍李白、鲁迅等作家，介绍诗经、红楼梦等作品，常常说得太多。因为时间有限，要多说就得快说。学生听了，不懂的地方自然有，懂了的也记不下要点来。堂上只觉得天花乱坠，堂下便感到怅然若失。
    只根据以上三点看来，我们的教学语言中的八股腔是很严重的。
    要为学生服务，就得说学生能懂的话，并且应该尽力使学生喜欢听和容易记忆。我希望中等学校的文学教师们，把改进教学语言，反对八股腔，作为我们整风的内容之一。
