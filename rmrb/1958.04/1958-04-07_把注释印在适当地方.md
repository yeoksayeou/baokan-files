    Print Annotations in Appropriate Places
    To help readers understand books, it is necessary for editors and writers to annotate difficult words, phrases, sentences, or plot points in the book.
    However, I think the current typesetting of annotations in many books is not quite appropriate. The annotations in some books are placed at the end of each book (or volume), such as "The Complete Works of Lu Xun"; the annotations in some books are placed at the end of each article or chapter, such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Dream of the Red Chamber"; and the annotations in some books are placed between the lines of the main text. The above methods of arranging annotations are inconvenient for readers. Some books have annotations arranged on the left or bottom of each page, such as "The Young Guard" and "Anti-Dühring," which is welcomed by readers.
    I think it is better to use two types of typesetting for annotations in general new editions, depending on the nature and length of the article. For short articles, such as poems and short essays, it is better to place the annotations at the end of each article; for longer articles, such as novellas, novels, papers, and theoretical works, it is better to place the annotations on the side or bottom of each page.

    把注释印在适当地方
    为了帮助读者阅读书籍，编辑、作家们把书中某些费解的字、词、句子或故事的情节加以注释，是很必要的。
    但是，我觉得目前有许多书注释的排版方式还不太合适。有些书的注释排在每本（每卷）书的后面，如“鲁迅全集”；有些书的注释排在每篇文章或每章每回的后面，如“毛泽东选集”、“红楼梦”等；有些书的注释排在正文行间。上面几种排注释的方式使读者感到不便。有些书的注释排在每页的左边或下边，如“青年近卫军”、“反杜林论”等，这种排法受到读者欢迎。
    我觉得，一般新版书的注释采用两种方式排版较好，根据文章的性质和长短来决定。短小文章，如诗歌、短文等的注释，以排在每篇文章后面较好；而比较长篇的文章，如中篇、长篇小说、论文、理论著作等的注释，排在每页的旁边或下边较好。　居人
