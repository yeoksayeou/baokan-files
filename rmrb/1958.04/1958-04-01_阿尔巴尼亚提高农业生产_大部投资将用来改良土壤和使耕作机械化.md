    (News from this newspaper) Based on the great achievements of the agricultural collectivization movement in recent years and the bumper harvest of agricultural products last year, Albania will further increase agricultural production this year. This year's grain production plan will increase by 19.4% compared with last year, cotton and tobacco will increase by 26%, and sugar beet will increase by 16%. In order to help farmers achieve this production plan, the state will invest 2.362 billion lek in agriculture this year. More than half of the investment will be used for soil improvement and mechanized farming. In addition, the state will also supply a large amount of chemical fertilizers to rural areas. It is planned that rural areas will receive more than twice as much chemical fertilizer this year as last year. Most of the chemical fertilizers imported by Albania from the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have been transported to agricultural cooperatives before spring plowing.
    Recently, a campaign to increase the number of livestock has also been launched in rural Albania, so that animal husbandry, which accounts for one-third of agricultural income, will achieve rapid development this year. The state calls on every agricultural cooperative to open dairy farms in order to increase milk production. The number of sheep is expected to increase by 12% to 17% compared with last year, and the improvement and quantity of sheep breeds will be doubled compared with last year. The number of pigs will increase the most, with a planned increase of 84% this year.

    阿尔巴尼亚提高农业生产
    大部投资将用来改良土壤和使耕作机械化
    本报讯　在近年来农业合作化运动的巨大成就和去年农产品丰收的基础上，阿尔巴尼亚今年将进一步大力提高农业生产。今年的粮食生产计划比去年增加19.4％，棉花和烟叶增加26％，甜菜增加16％。国家为了帮助农民实现这一生产计划，今年在农业方面将投资二十三亿六千二百万里克。投资的一半以上将要用在土壤改良和机械化耕作方面。此外，国家还要以大量化学肥料供应农村。计划今年农村得到的化学肥料将比去年增加一倍以上。阿尔巴尼亚从苏联和德意志民主共和国进口的一部分化学肥料，绝大部分已在春耕前运到了农业合作社。
    最近，在阿尔巴尼亚农村还展开了一个增加牲畜头数的运动，要在今年使占农业收入达三分之一的畜牧业获得迅速的发展。国家号召每一个农业合作社都要开辟奶牛场，以便增产牛奶。羊的头数预计要比去年增加12％到17％，羊种的改良工作和数量将比去年扩大一倍。猪的头数增加最多，计划今年增加84％。
