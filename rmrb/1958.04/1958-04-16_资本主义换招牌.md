Capitalism Changes its Signboard
He Jun

Two American bourgeois "theoreticians" recently fabricated a so-called new "theory" of "clean capitalism."

How strange, how strange! Capitalism is changing its signboard, said to be unclean in the past, causing economic crises.

How rare, how rare! How can capitalism be clean! Covered in the stench of money and soaked in blood, the capitalists are rotten from skin to bone.

How absurd, how absurd! Saying they want to build a utopia, where "everyone becomes a capitalist," who will work hard for the boss then?

What a joke, what a joke! "Workers exploit the capitalists!"

Zhao Gao's ghost has returned, becoming an American "theoretician."

How clever, how clever, yet not so clever! The fox's tail is sticking out. The more "clean" capitalism becomes, the more the workers can't survive!

In vain, in vain, still in vain! The new "theory" is bound to fail. Even if capitalism changes its signboard, it still can't escape the economic crisis!

    资本主义换招牌
    禾君
    两位美国资产阶级“理论家”最近制造出所谓“干净的资本主义”的新“理论”古怪古怪真古怪，资本主义换招牌，据说从前不干净，惹出经济危机来。稀奇稀奇真稀奇，资本主义哪有干净的！满手铜臭浑身血，资本家从皮脏到骨头里。荒唐荒唐多荒唐，说要建立乌托邦，“一切人都成资本家”，谁还为老板赚钱忙？笑话笑话太笑话，“工人剥削了资本家”！赵高借尸又还魂，变成了美国“理论家”。巧妙巧妙不巧妙，狐狸尾巴外边翘，资本主义越“干净”，工人就更活不了！枉然枉然还枉然，新“理论”毕竟要破产，资本主义纵然把招牌换，也过不了经济危机关！
