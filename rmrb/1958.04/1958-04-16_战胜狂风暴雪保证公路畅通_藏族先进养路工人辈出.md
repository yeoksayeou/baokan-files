    Conquering Fierce Winds and Blizzards to Ensure Smooth Highway Traffic
    Advanced Tibetan Road Maintenance Workers Emerge in Large Numbers
    In the 1957 socialist labor competition, the Majiangzong Maintenance Section of the Laya Highway, under the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Transportation Bureau, saw the emergence of eighteen advanced producers from both Tibetan and Han ethnic groups, as well as three advanced production teams comprised entirely of Tibetan workers.
    The Third Road Team, an advanced production unit ranked first by the maintenance section, consisted of ten Tibetan workers. They maintain a sixteen-kilometer stretch of highway, all of which lies on the Xugela Mountain at an altitude of 5,300 meters above sea level. Under harsh weather conditions and difficult working conditions, they persistently overcame difficulties such as attacks by fierce winds and blizzards, ensuring smooth and flat road surfaces and uninterrupted traffic. Moreover, their annual attendance rate reached over 98%.
    The road maintenance workers in this section are all Tibetan people, most of whom have been working for two to four years. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, their class consciousness has greatly improved, and they have demonstrated great enthusiasm and creativity in their work. For example, Jiang Cheng, the leader of the Ninth Team who was rated as a first-class advanced producer, volunteered to work in the swift and cold river during the erection of a steel bridge in the section last September. He shivered with cold, but persisted in his work and cheerfully said, "This is our own business; how can we be a worker if we are afraid of difficulties?" In this way, he led everyone to build the bridge well, ensuring smooth traffic.

    战胜狂风暴雪保证公路畅通
    藏族先进养路工人辈出
    青藏公路交通运输管理局所属拉亚公路麻江宗养护段，在1957年的社会主义劳动竞赛中，涌现出十八名藏、汉族先进生产者和三个全部是藏族工人的先进生产道班。
    养护段评出的一等先进生产单位、第三道班的十名藏族工人，养护着全长十六公里的公路，全部的路线都在拔海五千三百公尺高的旭格拉山上。在气候坏、工作条件差的情况下，他们顽强地战胜了狂风暴雪袭击等困难，保证了路面平坦和汽车畅通。并且，全年出勤率达到了98％以上。
    该段的养路工人，都是藏族人民，大部分参加工作有二至四年的时间。他们在党的教育培养下，阶级觉悟有了很大的提高，在工作中发挥了劳动积极性和创造性。如一个被评为一等先进生产者的九班班长将称，于去年9月份在该段架设钢桥中，自告奋勇地到水急又冷的河中工作，他冻得发抖，仍然坚持工作，还愉快地说：“这是我们自己的事情，怕困难还能成工人。”他就这样带动大家把桥架好，保证了汽车畅通无阻。
