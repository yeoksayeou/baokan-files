Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 2nd April - A new exploration well in the southeastern part of the Karamay Oilfield has recently gushed a large quantity of crude oil. This exploration well yields forty to fifty tons of oil per day, the highest yield among the gushing wells in the Karamay Oilfield in the past.

This gushing exploration well is located south of the Karamay geological fault. In the past, when expanding the oilfield boundary, several exploration wells were drilled south of the geological fault, but no industrial oil flow was obtained. This situation had led people to suspect that the fault might be the southern boundary of the oilfield. The recent fact that this exploration well has gushed a large amount of crude oil proves that there is great hope in the area south of the fault. At present, the Karamay Mining Bureau has arranged for many exploration wells in this area to accelerate drilling.

The exploration work extending towards Urho in the eastern part of Karamay has also achieved new results recently. An exploration well drilled in the Baikouquan area, between Karamay and Urho, has recently obtained good oil sand and gas shows during the drilling process. This place is sixty kilometers away from Karamay, and industrial-value crude oil has already been drilled in most of the area in between. The good oil and gas shows obtained from this exploration well indicate that the known oilfield area of Karamay may still continue to expand eastward.

### 克拉玛依油田继续扩大  一口新探井每天喷油四、五十吨

    克拉玛依油田继续扩大
    一口新探井每天喷油四、五十吨
    新华社乌鲁木齐2日电　克拉玛依油田东南部一口探井，最近喷出大量原油。这口探井每天喷油四十到五十多吨，是克拉玛依油田过去喷油井中产量最高的一口。
    这口喷油的探井的位置在克拉玛依地层断裂以南。过去扩大油田边界时，在地层断裂以南钻凿过几口探井，都未获得工业性的油流。这种情况曾使人们怀疑断裂处可能就是油田南部的边界了。最近这口探井喷出大量原油的事实，证明断裂以南地区有很大希望。目前克拉玛依矿务局已在这个地区安排了好多探井加速钻探。
    向克拉玛依东部乌尔禾方向延伸的钻探工作，最近也取得新的成果。在克拉玛依和乌尔禾中间的百口泉地区钻凿的一口探井，最近在钻进过程中取得很好的油沙和油气显示。这个地方距离克拉玛依六十公里，中间大部分地区已经钻出有工业价值的原油。这口探井取得的良好油气显示，表明克拉玛依已知油田面积仍有可能继续向东部扩大。
