Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 21st April: The Fushun Petroleum Design Institute has recently rushed out standard design drawings for four types of coal-to-oil factories. These designs include three small-scale coal heap dry distillation plants with annual crude oil production capacities of 300 tons, 1,000 tons, and 3,000 tons, as well as a water gas medium-pressure iron catalyst synthesis plant with an annual crude oil production capacity of 3,000 tons.

The raw material required for the coal heap dry distillation plant is bituminous coal with an oil content of over 80%, which is widely distributed. Its main products are diesel oil for diesel engines, tractors, waterwheels, etc., and semi-coke for indigenous steelmaking and small blast furnace ironmaking. It can also produce a small amount of gasoline. Its equipment and operation are very simple, and ordinary farmers can master it after short-term training. The investment is also small; the 300-ton scale requires only over 10,000 yuan, the 1,000-ton scale over 40,000 yuan, and the 3,000-ton scale over 70,000 yuan. Any county or township that can open small coal mines can establish such a plant. The raw material required for the 3,000-ton water gas medium-pressure iron catalyst synthesis plant is semi-coke or anthracite. It has a complete crude oil processing system, and its main products are gasoline and kerosene. The equipment and technology are more complex than the former type, and it is suitable for establishment by special districts.

The equipment and materials for these factories can all be supplied domestically, and the construction time only takes two to nine months. In special districts with resource conditions, if special districts and counties and townships establish the above two types of factories separately, it is possible to form a relatively complete artificial petroleum industry network in a short period of time.

    哪里有煤哪里就能炼油
    抚顺石油设计院完成四种小石油厂定型设计
    年产三百吨石油的工厂只需要一万多元投资
    新华社抚顺21日电　抚顺石油设计院最近赶制出四种煤炼油工厂定型设计图，这些设计包括年产原油三百吨、一千吨、三千吨的三种小规模的煤成堆干馏厂，以及年产原油三千吨的水煤气中压铁剂合成厂。
    煤成堆干馏工厂所需的原料，是资源分布很广的含油80％以上的烟煤。它的主要产品是供柴油机、拖拉机、水车等用的柴油和供土法炼钢、小高炉炼铁用的半焦，也可以出产少量汽油。它的设备、操作都很简单，普通农民经过短期训练就能掌握。投资也很少，三百吨规模的只需一万多元，一千吨的四万多元，三千吨的七万多元。凡是能开小煤窑的县、乡，都能够开办。三千吨的水煤气中压铁剂合成厂所需的原料是半焦或无烟煤。它有成套的原油加工系统，主要产品是汽油和煤油，设备技术比前一类复杂，适合专区开办。
    这些工厂的设备材料都可以从国内得到供应，建厂时间只需两个月到九个月。在有资源条件的专区内，由专区和县乡分别开办上述两类工厂，就有可能在短时期形成一个比较完整的人造石油工业网。
