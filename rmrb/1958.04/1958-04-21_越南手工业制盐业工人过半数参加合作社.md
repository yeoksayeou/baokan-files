    According to a Vietnam News Agency report: 10% of handicraft workers in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have now organized themselves and embarked on the road of cooperativization. Most of these handicraft production cooperatives and cooperative groups have signed contracts with state commercial institutions, with the state supplying raw materials and purchasing products. Because the vast number of handicraft workers have organized, production cooperatives and cooperative groups have generally increased production. For example, a textile production cooperative in Haiphong has increased the amount of fabric produced per person from five meters to fifteen meters per day. Average output has increased by 50% compared to individual producers.
    It is estimated that 60% of individual producers in the salt industry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam will be organized into mutual aid teams this year. The salt industry is one of the important economic sectors in North Vietnam, with salt ponds distributed in ten provinces, covering an area of approximately 1,400 hectares and employing more than 47,000 people. By the end of last year, 844 salt industry mutual aid teams and 80 production cooperatives had been established in North Vietnam. This has greatly promoted increased production. North Vietnam's salt production last year reached approximately 110,000 tons, an increase of 170% over the pre-war 1939 production.

    越南手工业制盐业工人过半数参加合作社
    本报讯　据越南通讯社消息：越南民主共和国的手工业者现在有10％已经组织起来，走上了合作化的道路。这些手工业生产合作社和合作组大部分同国家的商业机构订了合同，由国家供给原料并收购产品。因为广大手工业者组织起来了，生产合作社和合作组一般都提高了产量。例如，海防的一个纺织生产合作社，每人生产的织品已从一天五公尺增到十五公尺。平均产量都比个体生产者提高了50％。
    越南民主共和国制盐业的个体生产者，今年预定将有60％组织成互助组。制盐业是北越重要的经济部门之一，盐池分布在十个省份，占地约一千四百公顷，从业人员达四万七千多人。到去年年底，越南北方已经建立起八百四十四个盐业互助组和八十个生产合作社。这对提高生产有很大的促进作用。北越去年盐产量约达十一万吨，比战前1939年的产量增加了170％。
