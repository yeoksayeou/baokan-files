Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Soviet government's decision to cease testing all atomic and hydrogen weapons from March 31 this year continues to be warmly welcomed by an increasing number of national leaders and people.

    Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz said in a letter to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev that the Polish government welcomes with satisfaction and fully supports the Soviet Union's unilateral decision to cease nuclear testing. The Polish government sincerely hopes that the Soviet government's decision will elicit a due response from the governments of Western countries possessing nuclear weapons.

    Bulgarian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Yugov issued a statement saying that the Bulgarian government and all the people wholeheartedly welcome and support the Soviet Union's decision to cease nuclear testing. The statement pointed out that the issue of ceasing nuclear weapons testing and eliminating the danger of atomic war has become one of the most pressing issues of our time.

    Pakistani Prime Minister Noon said in a reply letter to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev that the Pakistani government is very satisfied with the Soviet government's decision to unilaterally cease all atomic and nuclear weapons tests, and said: "We believe that, as a first step in easing international tensions, this decision is very beneficial."

    Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker said in a speech in Toronto on the 16th that he hoped that countries of the "free world" would soon announce "their willingness to cease nuclear weapons testing."

    The British Peace Committee issued a statement on the 17th, welcoming the Soviet Union's decision to cease nuclear testing, and called on the British people to work to urge the British government to take the same steps. On the same day, the Scottish Trades Union Congress passed an eight-point peace plan, first calling for a cessation of nuclear testing and the holding of a summit conference.

    The American public continues to demand that the United States follow the Soviet example and announce a cessation of nuclear testing. The San Francisco "Chronicle" published seven such letters from readers on the 18th.
