The principle of emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past must be implemented in historical science, and an ideological remolding movement to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology must be carried out. This is a necessary condition for realizing a great leap forward in historical science. This was the common opinion of speakers at a symposium on history and archeology held in the capital on the afternoon of the 5th. The symposium was convened by the State Council’s Scientific Planning Commission, and more than 100 historical and archeological workers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of History, Institute of Archeology, history departments of universities in the capital, and publishing institutions attended. Jian Bozan presided over the meeting.

Fan Wenlan delivered a speech on how to implement the principle of "emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past" in historical science. He said that it is natural to emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past when discussing history. However, the current situation in the historical field is precisely the opposite: de-emphasizing the present and emphasizing the past. This is indeed an abnormal phenomenon, a sign of decline, and needs to be corrected quickly. He criticized the erroneous view of those who emphasize the past and de-emphasize the present, which separates academics from politics. He cited Confucius' writing of the Spring and Autumn Annals, Sima Qian's writing of the Records of the Grand Historian, and Sima Guang's writing of the Zizhi Tongjian as examples to illustrate that valuable historical works in the feudal era had certain political purposes, and mainly wrote about the affairs of the writer's "present era." He also cited Kang Youwei's writing of "New Text Forgery Classics Study" and "Confucius' Reform Study," and Zhang Taiyan, Liu Shipei, and others founding the "National Essence Journal" as examples to illustrate that Chinese bourgeois reformers and revolutionaries also understood that academics serve politics. He said that the first to advocate the separation of academics and politics were comprador bourgeois intellectuals represented by Hu Shi. The purpose of their proposing this slogan was to make people indifferent to politics in order to benefit Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. He believes that some of those who advocate separating academics from politics today are conscious disciples of Hu Shi, and this is a very small number. Others are unconsciously influenced by Hu Shi, and this is a larger number. Although the situations of the two types of people are different, their academic style of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present, escaping reality, and separating from politics is the same. These two types of people should deeply reflect on themselves and jump out of the ivory tower of the Three Dynasties. He said that whether to emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past or to de-emphasize the present and emphasize the past is a struggle between two roads: promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology or promoting bourgeois ideology and eliminating proletarian ideology. Our new historical workers must stand on the Marxist standpoint and take it as their responsibility to emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. To emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past, first, it is necessary to expand and strengthen the forces studying contemporary history and change the abnormal phenomenon. Second, establish the ideology of emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and truly use the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to conduct research. Here, while expanding and strengthening the study of contemporary history, Marxists must also devote part of their forces to occupy the position of ancient history. Ancient history is a stronghold for bourgeois scholars to resist stubbornly. Although the areas and points they occupy are very limited, they despise us based on this. We can overwhelm them with a little effort. Finally, he suggested that we fully open up the garden for the contention of a hundred schools of thought and use the method of learning while doing to improve our Marxist level. Secondly, Marxist historical workers who are in charge of leadership must engage in "experimental fields" and make achievements in their work to promote the great leap forward in the entire historical science work.

Hou Wailu and Yin Da spoke about the problem of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present in ancient history and archeology. Hou Wailu believes that emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past is a matter of world outlook and methodology. The very posing of the question is the solution to the problem. He believes that whether studying ancient history or modern history, the principle of emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past must be implemented so that the works written will have educational significance for the people. Studying ancient history can only achieve something under the principle of understanding the present and then being knowledgeable about the past. Yin Da criticized the tendency to escape reality in archeological work, "not hearing about current affairs, but only focusing on ancient history." In recent years, many sites and antiquities have been excavated, but no comprehensive research has been carried out. Archeology has not been regarded as a component of theoretical struggle, but has instead become a frivolous pursuit divorced from everything. Among some archeological workers, there has also been a tendency to pursue personal fame and gain by competing for materials, writing reports, and seeking leadership positions. Weng Dujian mentioned that in the study of the history of ethnic minorities, the research objects are mostly concentrated on historical terms and historical materials, while there is little research on the current situation of ethnic minorities and the history of modern ethnic minorities. He believes that for some ethnic minority histories, it is impossible to start without studying from the present. In addition, Zhou Yiliang introduced the problem of the two roads in historical teaching revealed by the history department of Peking University in the double-anti movement.

Bai Shouyi proposed that in order to improve teaching quality, teaching staff should engage in scientific research work. He suggested that university teachers should work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences for a certain period, and scientific research personnel should also teach at universities regularly. His opinion was endorsed by Jian Bozan, Liu Danian, and others. Liu Daosheng believes that the important issue at present is to organize the ranks of scientific workers, so he suggested resuming the activities of various academic societies. Liu Danian read out the five-year work plan of the Third Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences at the meeting.

    首都历史考古学座谈会的共同思想
    历史科学必须厚今薄古  学术研究要同政治结合
    本报讯　在历史科学中贯彻厚今薄古的原则，开展兴无灭资的思想改造运动，是实现历史科学大跃进的必要条件，这是首都5日下午召开的历史、考古学座谈会上的发言者的共同意见。这次座谈会是由国务院科学规划委员会召集，有科学院历史研究所、考古所和首都高等学校历史系、出版机关等的历史考古工作者一百多人出席。会议由翦伯赞主持。
    范文澜就历史科学如何贯彻“厚今薄古”的原则问题，作了发言。他说，讲历史，厚今薄古，本来是很自然的道理。可是现在史学界的情况恰恰是薄今厚古。这实在是一种反常的现象，是一种衰暮的现象，需要赶快纠正。他批评了厚古薄今论者的将学术和政治分离的错误观点。他以孔子作春秋、司马迁作史记和司马光作资治通鉴为例，说明了封建时代有价值的历史著作都有一定的政治目的，而且主要是写作者“所见世”的事情。他又以康有为作新学伪经考、孔子改制考、章太炎、刘师培等创办国粹学报为例，说明中国资产阶级改良派和革命派也懂得学术为政治服务。他说首先提倡学术和政治分离的是以胡适为代表的买办资产阶级知识分子，他们提出这个口号的目的是使人不问政治，以达到有利于蒋介石的反动统治。他认为今天主张学术脱离政治的人有的是自觉的胡适门徒，这种人是极少数，有的是不自觉的受了胡适的影响，这种人为数较多。两种人情况不同，但厚古薄今，逃避现实、脱离政治的学风则是一样的，这两种人应该深刻反省，从三代的象牙塔中跳出来。他说厚今薄古还是薄今厚古，是兴无灭资还是兴资灭无的两条道路的斗争。我们新史学工作者必须站在马克思主义的立场，以厚今薄古，兴无灭资为己任。要厚今薄古，第一，要扩大和加强研究今史的力量，把反常现象改变过来。第二，确立厚今薄古，兴无灭资的思想，确实用马克思主义的立场观点和方法来进行研究。这里，在扩大和加强今史的研究的同时，马克思主义者还必须分出一部分力量来占领古史的阵地。古史是资产阶级学者顽抗的据点，虽然他们占据的片和点有限得很，但是他们也就凭这一点藐视我们。我们稍微花一点工夫，就可以压倒他们。最后，他建议全力开辟百家争鸣的园地，用边干边学的办法，提高我们的马克思主义水平。其次，担负领导工作的马克思主义史学工作者必须搞“试验田”，在业务上做出成绩来，推动整个历史科学工作的大跃进。
    侯外庐和尹达就古代史和考古学方面的厚古薄今问题作了发言。侯外庐认为厚今薄古是个世界观和思想方法的问题，问题的提法本身就是问题的解决。他认为无论是研究古代史或是近代史，都必须贯彻厚今薄古的原则，这样写出来的著作才能对人民有教育意义。研究古代史只有在通今然后博古的原则下，才能有所成就。尹达批评了考古事业方面的“两耳不闻当前事，一心只把古来考”的逃避现实的倾向。几年来发掘的遗址、古物很多，但没有进行综合性的研究，没有把考古学当成理论斗争的组成部分，反变成了脱离一切的玩物丧志的东西。在部分考古工作者中间，也出现了争材料、争写报告、争作领导的追逐个人名利的倾向。翁独健谈到在少数民族史的研究中，研究对象多半集中在历史名词和历史资料方面，而对少数民族的现状，现代少数民族历史研究很少。他认为有些少数民族的历史，不从现在研究起，就无从入手。此外，周一良介绍了北京大学历史系在双反运动中所揭露的历史教学中两条道路的问题。
    白寿彝提出为了提高教学质量，教学工作人员应该进行科学研究工作。他建议高等学校教师，有一定时期到科学院去工作，而科学研究人员也应定期到高等学校去教书。他的意见得到了翦伯赞、刘大年等的赞同。刘导生认为，目前的重要问题是把科学工作者的队伍组织起来，因此建议恢复各种学会的活动。刘大年在会上宣读了科学院历史研究第三所今后五年工作计划。
