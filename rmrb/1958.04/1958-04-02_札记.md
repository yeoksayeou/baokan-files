    Notes
    Who is Lying?
    The Chairman of the US Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, Durham, said, "The Soviet Union's action of stopping nuclear weapons testing is a hoax," because: "Stopping nuclear weapons testing does not cause them any loss, because Moscow retains the right to do so when any other country resumes testing, while the United States is scheduled to begin a series of tests next month."
    If Durham believes that his statement is not a hoax, then why doesn't the United States, as the "other country," stop the scheduled tests, so that the Soviet Union has no way to "do so as well," in order to promote the permanent cessation of nuclear weapons testing?
    US State Department spokesman White stated that the United States will conduct nuclear tests as usual this spring and summer. This proves that Durham's clamor is nothing more than an excuse for the United States to refuse the Soviet Union's request to stop nuclear tests together. The one who is lying is this American atomic maniac.
      Birds of a Feather
    The puppet "President" of South Korea, Syngman Rhee, told a reporter from an American newspaper that he was willing to send his armed forces to Indonesia to assist the rebels in their operations.
  This is truly a case of "catfish seeking catfish, bullheads seeking bullheads," national scum sympathizing with national scum, which is not surprising at all.
    Syngman Rhee said: "Let us go and help them. Who will stop us?" He seems to have a "go ahead bravely" attitude, but this question reveals his weakness and shows his timid "hesitation." This is just like the character of the teacher in "Fisherman's Revenge," who says very toughly: "Who dares to touch us?" But in reality, his legs are trembling. Because Syngman Rhee also knows that if he really sends troops, those who will stop them will not only be all the patriotic people of Indonesia, but also the people of the world who love peace and justice.

    札记
    谁骗人
    美国两院原子能联合委员会主席达拉姆说，“苏联停止核武器试验的行动是骗人的”，理由是：“停止核武器试验并没有使他们有任何损失，因为莫斯科保留着在有任何其他国家重新进行试验时它也可以这样做的权利，而美国却预定在下月开始进行一系列试验。”
    如果达拉姆认为他的这种说法不是骗人的，那么，作为“其他国家”的美国为什么不停止预定的试验，使苏联没有办法“也可以这样做”，以便促进核武器试验的永远停止呢？
    美国国务院的发言人怀特表示，美国在今春今夏要照常进行核试验。这就证明达拉姆的叫嚣不过是为美国拒绝苏联提出的要美国一起来停止核试验的要求找借口罢了。骗人的正是这位美国的原子狂人。
      臭味相投
    南朝鲜的傀儡“总统”李承晚对美国报纸记者说：他愿意派遣他的武装部队到印度尼西亚去协助叛乱分子作战。
  这真叫作“鲇鱼找鲇鱼，嘎鱼找嘎鱼”，民族败类同情民族败类，原也没有什么奇怪。
    李承晚说：“让我们去帮助他们。谁会阻止我们？”看来，颇有“勇往直前”的样子，但这一问，却泄了元气，露出他的“逡巡不前”的胆怯来了。这正像“打渔杀家”中教师爷一类的人物，嘴巴上说得很硬：“谁敢碰咱爷们？”实际上腿肚子却直打哆嗦。因为李承晚也不会不知道，如果真的派兵出去，阻止他们的将不仅有印度尼西亚的全体爱国人民，而且还有全世界爱好和平和正义的人民。
