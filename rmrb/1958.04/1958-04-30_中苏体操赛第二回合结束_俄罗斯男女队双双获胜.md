The second round of the Sino-Soviet gymnastics competition was held last night at the Beijing Gymnasium. Because the competition featured optional routines, allowing each athlete to showcase their strengths, this competition was even more intense and exciting than the previous one.

The results of the optional routines competition showed that both the visiting men's and women's athletes scored higher than the youth team. Adding the scores from the compulsory routines on the 27th, the Russian team's male athletes achieved a total score of 551.85 points, surpassing the youth team's male athletes by 6.20 points. The visiting female athletes scored 362.03 points, exceeding the youth team's female athletes by 7.21 points.

The top three positions in the men's all-around competition were all taken by the visiting athletes. Lisitsky of the Russian team, who won the first place in the men's overall score in the compulsory routines competition on the 27th, once again defeated all opponents in last night's optional routines competition, winning the men's all-around first place. His score was 111.55 points. Chernov and Birogov respectively won the second and third places in the men's all-around. The women's all-around champion was Kavrilova of the visiting team, who scored a total of 73.51 points. Qi Yufang, a female athlete from the youth team, was the first place winner in the overall score of the compulsory routines competition, but last night she was defeated by Kavrilova by a margin of 0.51 points, ranking second.

In the compulsory routines competition on the 27th, both sides won seven first places. Yesterday, the youth team members suffered from poor performance and failed in their movements multiple times, winning only four first places in total, while the visiting team won the remaining eight first places (two of which were tied with the youth team).

Yu Liefeng and Cai Geng, male members of the Chinese youth gymnastics team, were originally first-level athletes. This time, their scores both exceeded 104 points, reaching the standard of Master of Sports. (Attached picture)

    中苏体操赛第二回合结束
    俄罗斯男女队双双获胜
    本报讯　昨晚在北京体育馆举行俄罗斯体操队同我国青年体操队的自选动作比赛。因为作的是自选动作，每个运动员都能发挥所长，所以这次比赛比上次更紧张精彩。
    自选动作比赛结果，客队男女运动员的得分都超过了青年队。加上27日规定动作的得分，总结果俄罗斯队男运动员共得五五一点八五分，胜青年队男运动员六点二零分。客队女运动员得三六二点零三分，超过青年队女队七点二一分。
    这次比赛的男子全能前三名都被客队运动员获得。在27日规定动作比赛中，获得男子总分第一的俄罗斯队里西茨基在昨晚的自选动作比赛中又战败了所有的对手，获得男子全能第一名。他的成绩是一一一点五五分。切尔诺夫和比罗郭夫分别获得男子全能第二、三名。获得女子全能冠军的是客队卡伏里洛娃，她共得了七三点五一分。青年队女运动员戚玉芳是规定动作比赛的总分第一名，但是昨晚她以零点五一分之差为卡伏里洛娃所击败，屈居第二名。
    27日的规定动作比赛结果，双方都得了七个第一。昨天，青年队队员因为表演失常，动作失败多次，一共只得了四个第一，其余八个第一（有两项是同青年队合得第一）都为客队夺去。
    参加比赛的我国青年体操队男队员于烈烽和蔡庚原来是一级运动员，这次，他们的得分都超过一○四分，达到了运动健将标准。（附图片）
