    实现万隆会议经济合作原则
    我给印度尼西亚实物贷款
    新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚副总理兼代理外交部长哈迪17日上午同中国驻印度尼西亚大使黄镇就以贷款方式由印度尼西亚向中国购买大米和布匹问题交换了照会。这是中国同印度尼西亚签订贷款协定的第一步。印度尼西亚对外经济关系司司长伊斯梅尔、亚洲太平洋司副司长萨尼、中国大使馆参赞甘野陶和商务参赞杨琳都参加了交换照会的仪式。
    哈迪在交换了照会以后讲了话，他代表印度尼西亚政府对中国政府在印度尼西亚人民迫切需要的时候把大米和棉布送到印度尼西亚来表示感谢。
    中国大使在他的讲话中表示，中国人民感到荣幸，他们能够在印度尼西亚人民为了印度尼西亚主权的完整进行斗争时为印度尼西亚人民的需要贡献力量。黄镇说，中国这样做也是为了实现万隆会议关于经济合作的原则。
    据悉，这一部分中国大米和布匹贷款（包括两万吨大米和七千二百万码布匹）总值达四千八百万瑞士法郎。大部分大米和布匹正在从中国运往印度尼西亚的途中。
