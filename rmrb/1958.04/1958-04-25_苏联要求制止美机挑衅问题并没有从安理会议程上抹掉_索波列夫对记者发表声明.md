Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd, TASS, New York, April 23rd: The Soviet Union's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, held a press conference on the 22nd, issuing a statement to reporters regarding the Soviet Union's request for the United Nations Security Council to take measures to stop the provocative flights of American military aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs.

Sobolev first pointed out in his statement: There are reports that the Soviet delegation's withdrawal of its proposal in the United Nations Security Council "also withdrew its accusations." This news is completely inconsistent with the actual situation.

Sobolev said: The Soviet delegation withdrew its proposal to protest the Security Council's passage, under pressure from the US representative, of an unprecedented discussion procedure that hindered broad discussion of the issue we raised. Chairman Lodge attempted to replace serious discussion by starting the voting machine.

Sobolev declared: The Soviet government still firmly insists on taking necessary measures to stop provocative threats to peace, including measures taken by the Security Council. The "issue of taking urgent measures to stop US military aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs from flying towards the Soviet border" remains on the Security Council's agenda. The press conference held by Sobolev aroused great interest, and reporters from various countries stationed at the United Nations and diplomatic commentators from New York newspapers attended the conference.

Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, TASS, Moscow: The Soviet Peace Defense Committee telegraphed UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 23rd, protesting the United Nations Security Council's refusal to discuss the Soviet Union's proposal regarding provocative flights by American bombers carrying atomic bombs towards the Soviet border.

    苏联要求制止美机挑衅问题并没有从安理会议程上抹掉
    索波列夫对记者发表声明
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社纽约23日讯：苏联常驻联合国代表索波列夫22日举行记者招待会，就苏联要求联合国安全理事会采取措施制止载有原子弹氢弹的美国军用飞机的挑衅飞行问题向记者们发表了一个声明。
    索波列夫在声明中首先指出：有消息说，苏联代表团在联合国安全理事会中撤回自己的提案是“把自己的控诉也撤回了”。这种消息是完全不符合实际情况的。
    索波列夫说：苏联代表团撤回自己的提案，是为了表示抗议安全理事会在美国代表的压力下就我们所提出的问题通过了阻碍广泛讨论的、史无前例的讨论程序。主席洛奇企图用开动表决机器来代替认真的讨论。
    索波列夫声明：苏联政府仍然坚决主张采取必要的措施来制止对和平的挑衅性威胁，其中也包括由安全理事会采取措施。“关于采取紧急措施来制止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国军用飞机向苏联边境飞行问题”，仍然列在安全理事会的议程上面。索波列夫举行的记者招待会引起了很大的兴趣，各国驻联合国的记者和纽约各报的外交评论员都出席了这次招待会。
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联保卫和平委员会23日打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，抗议联合国安全理事会拒绝讨论苏联提出的载有原子弹的美国轰炸机向苏联边境作挑衅飞行的问题。
