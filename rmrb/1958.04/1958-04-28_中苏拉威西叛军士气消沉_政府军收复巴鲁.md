Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 27th. Lieutenant Colonel Piangadi, a spokesman for the Indonesian Army, said on the 26th that the resistance of the rebel elements in Central Sulawesi was extremely insignificant, and that the government forces would only need two days to pacify the entire Kulawi region. Kulawi is a mountain range south of Palu, which the rebels intended to use for guerrilla warfare.

Piangadi said that government forces had already retaken the city of Palu on the west coast of Central Sulawesi on April 18th. At that time, a total of fifty-two rebels, eight rebel police officers, and eight other rebel officials surrendered. Government forces seized many weapons, vehicles, and thirteen tons of grain from the rebels.

The military spokesman said that the six hundred family members of the rebel personnel have been protected and cared for by the government forces.

    中苏拉威西叛军士气消沉
    政府军收复巴鲁
    新华社雅加达27日电　印度尼西亚陆军发言人皮恩加迪中校26日说，中苏拉威西的叛乱分子的抵抗情况极为微不足道，政府军只需要两天时间就可以绥靖整个库拉威地区。库拉威是巴鲁南部的一条山脉，叛乱分子打算用来进行游击战的。
    皮恩加迪说，政府军已经在4月18日收复了中苏拉威西西海岸的城市巴鲁。当时共有五十二名叛军、八名叛军方面警察和其他八名叛乱官员投降。政府军从叛军那里缴获了许多武器、车辆和十三吨粮食。
    这位军方发言人说，叛军人员的六百名家属已经得到政府军的保护和关怀。
