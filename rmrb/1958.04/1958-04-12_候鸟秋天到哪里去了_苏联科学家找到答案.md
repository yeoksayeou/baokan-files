Xinhua News Agency, Kaliningrad, April 11th: Where do migratory birds in the Soviet Union fly in the autumn? Last year, the biological station of the Soviet Academy of Sciences put rings on many kinds of migratory birds and released them to find the answer. Now the station has received the first batch of information from all over the world.

According to information sent by ornithologists from various countries, ringed dotterel and chaffinches released by the Soviet biological station were found to be overwintering in Belgium, and meadowlarks from the steppes were found in Italy and the Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean. In West Flanders, Belgium, a starling was captured that had been released by the Soviet biological station just one day earlier. In one day and night, this bird flew more than 1,200 kilometers. There are reports from France that a ringed goldcrest was captured there.

    候鸟秋天到哪里去了
    苏联科学家找到答案
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社加里宁格勒讯：苏联境内的候鸟秋季飞到哪里去了？苏联科学院生物站去年曾经给许多种候鸟戴上环圈然后放掉以寻求答案，现在这个站已经收到了来自世界各地的第一批资料。
    据各国鸟类学家送来的资料说，在比利时发现苏联生物站放出的带环的碛翵和燕雀在那里过冬，在意大利和地中海西部巴利阿利群岛发现有草原上的鹨。比利时西佛兰德省捕获了刚刚一天前由苏联生物站放出的椋鸟。一昼夜间这只鸟飞了一千二百多公里。法国有消息说，那里捕获了带环的戴菊鸟。
