    Dai Ethnic Group's Water-Splashing Festival
    Around the time of the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar each year, the Dai people celebrate their annual traditional festival – the Water-Splashing Festival. There is a prevalent legend about the origin of the Water-Splashing Festival: Long, long ago, a ferocious and evil demon king appeared in the area where the Dai people lived. He possessed great power, and no one could defeat him. He had a total of seven wives, all women from the common people whom he had plundered. They hated the demon king to the core, but they were helpless. One day, the demon king robbed a great deal of gold and silver treasures from outside and boasted of his abilities to his wives. His seventh wife took the opportunity to probe, saying, "Great King, your abilities are so great that you are truly invincible. You must be eternally immortal..." Upon hearing this, the demon king became even more arrogant and revealed his secret of self-preservation to her. It turned out that the demon king feared nothing, but as long as one of his hairs was pulled out and tied around his neck, he could be killed.
    The brave seventh wife happily told her six sisters this secret. They discussed and decided to eliminate the demon king that night. At night, the demon king fell asleep, and his seventh wife gently pulled a hair from the demon king's head and tightly tied it around his neck. In an instant, the demon king's head fell to the ground with a thud, rolling around, and immediately emitting thick smoke and raging flames, along with many demons rushing towards them. In a moment of quick thinking, one of them quickly picked up the demon's head, and immediately the fire on the ground was extinguished, and the demons also slipped away. Therefore, in order to avoid harming others, the seven of them took turns holding the demon king's head, each holding it for one year. When it was the second person's turn to hold it, it was exactly the seventh day after the Qingming Festival.
    The demon king was eliminated, and the Dai people obtained a peaceful life. To commemorate these seven brave and resourceful women, the Dai people call this day the "Water-Splashing Festival." During the Water-Splashing Festival, everyone splashes water on each other to help these seven kind women wash away the blood and filth on their bodies and prevent fire and illness.
    On the day before the Water-Splashing Festival, unmarried young men and women go to the mountains to pick fresh flowers and offer them to Buddha. During the festival, everyone dresses in festive attire. From early morning, they carry water buckets and fresh flowers, gather at Buddhist temples to pray and "bathe the Buddha." Then they splash water on each other, wishing each other good health.
    During the festival, the Dai villages appear even more lively. Streets and fields are filled with crowds singing and dancing. They beat ethnic musical instruments – elephant foot drums, cymbals – singing and laughing.
    On this day, groups of Dai people go to local Party and government offices and border defense troops to splash water and offer blessings to cadres of all ethnic groups and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Jingpo, Han, and other ethnic brothers and sisters who come to the market are also splashed with water by the Dai brothers and sisters as a blessing.

### 傣族的泼水节

    傣族的泼水节
    在每年的农历清明前后，是傣族人民一年一度的传统节日——泼水节。关于泼水节的来历，有这样一个较普遍的传说。很久很久以前，在傣族人民居住的地区出了一个极其凶恶的魔王，他的本领高强，没有人敌得过他。他一共有七个妻子，都是被掠夺来的民间妇女。她们对魔王恨之入骨，但又莫可奈何。有一天，魔王从外面抢劫了很多金银财宝回来，在妻子面前夸耀自己的本领。他的第七个妻子乘机试探说：“大王本领高强，真是天下无敌。你一定永远长生……”。魔王听了之后更加骄傲起来了，连自己的保身机密也泄露给她。原来魔王什么都不怕，但只要拔掉他一根头发，拴住他的脖子，就可以把他杀死。
    勇敢的第七个妻子高兴地把这个秘密告诉了她的六个姐姐。她们一起商量好，当晚就把魔王消灭掉。夜里，魔王睡熟了，他的第七个妻子便轻轻地从魔王的头上拔了一根头发，紧紧地拴住了魔王的脖子。一刹时，魔王的头颅扑通一声掉在地下，滚来滚去，登时冒起浓烟烈火，还有许多魔鬼向她们扑过来。情急智生，她们中间的一个赶快把恶魔的头颅抱起来，顿时地面上的火也灭了，魔鬼也溜了。于是，为了不贻害他人，她们七个人就轮流抱着魔王的头，每人抱一年，轮到第二个人抱的时候，正值清明节后的第七天。
    魔王被除掉了，傣族人民获得了和平的生活。为了纪念这七个勇敢机智的妇女，傣族人民就把这天叫做“泼水节”。在泼水节中大家互相泼水，表示帮助这七个善良的妇女冲洗她们身上的血污和秽气，以防止起火和生病。
    泼水节的前一天，未婚的青年男女便到山中去采摘鲜花回来献佛。节日里，大家都穿上盛装。从早晨起，他们便挑起水桶，带着鲜花，聚集到佛寺里去祈祷和“浴佛”。然后互相泼水，祝福身体健康。
    节日里，傣族的村寨显得更加热闹。街道上，田野间，到处是载歌载舞的人群。他们敲着民族乐器——象脚鼓、芒钹，唱着、欢笑着。
    这一天，傣族人民成群结队到当地党政机关、边防部队，向各民族的干部和解放军军官、战士泼水祝福。来赶集的景颇族、汉族和其他民族的兄弟姐妹们，也都要受到傣族兄弟姐妹的泼水祝福。
