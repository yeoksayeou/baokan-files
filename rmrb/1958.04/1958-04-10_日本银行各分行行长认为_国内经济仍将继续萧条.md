    Bank of Japan Branch Managers Believe
    Domestic Economy Will Continue to Decline
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: Managers of major branches of the Bank of Japan, in a press conference held on the 8th to discuss Japan's recent economic and financial situation, stated that as the policy of deflation deepens, the economies of various regions have recently continued to show a state of stagnation. Moreover, due to excessive inventory, there is a need to accelerate "production adjustment," and the recession is expected to continue until the end of this year.
    The Bank of Japan is holding a national branch managers' meeting. In their remarks, these branch managers believed that in terms of production, "enterprises are still suffering from overproduction, and the pressure of unsalable goods is high"; large enterprises have reduced orders to small and medium-sized enterprises. In terms of finance, apart from basic industries and emerging industrial sectors, "the upsurge of wanting to invest funds in production equipment has passed, and there is not much new demand for funds"; at the same time, financial institutions continue to adopt measures to tighten finance. In terms of consumption, the turnover of department stores and retailers is also beginning to decline. Therefore, on the whole, the prospects for the economic situation are still not very promising.

    日本银行各分行行长认为
    国内经济仍将继续萧条
    据新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本银行全国主要分行行长在8日举行的记者招待会上谈到日本最近的经济金融情况时认为，随着通货紧缩政策的深入推行，最近各地经济继续表现出停滞状态。而且由于存货过多，需要加紧“调整生产”，萧条状况将会继续到今年年底。
    日本银行正在举行全国分行行长会议。这些分行行长在他们的谈话中认为，在生产方面，“各企业仍然因生产过剩而苦恼，滞销货物的压力很大”；大企业对中小企业的订货有所减少。在金融方面，除去基本工业和新兴工业部门以外，“想把资金投到生产设备方面去的高潮已经过去，对资金新的需要不多”；同时，金融机构继续采取紧缩金融的办法。在消费方面，百货店、零售商的营业额也在开始减少。因此，整个看来，经济情况的前途仍然不大美妙。
