Spiritual Liberation
Yú Píng, Draftswoman, Cement Design Institute

The night of April 24th, a crescent moon in the sky above Guanzhuang appeared and disappeared among the floating clouds. A gentle breeze stirred the willow branches, carrying the fragrance of crabapple blossoms. At this time, in the collective dormitory for female staff members of various organizations in Guanzhuang, only scattered lights remained. Some were in the office rushing to finish work left undone during the day, some were writing letters to relatives far away, and some were leisurely strolling along the tree-lined paths. From the bursts of hearty laughter, one could feel how relaxed and happy they were.

Those who have never been to Guanzhuang might think this is an ordinary spring evening. However, for us young female comrades, this is not ordinary, because being able to be so relaxed and happy is only a recent development of the past few months.

During the period of the “Free Kingdom,” the hooligans of Guanzhuang were so rampant that they openly insulted female comrades in the offices, in the open-air theater, and even sometimes in broad daylight and in crowded places. At that time, we had to be extra vigilant no matter when or where we went. During the day, we hardly dared to stay in the office alone, and at night, we often didn’t dare to leave our homes. I remember that ever since one night in October 1956 at the open-air theater, when a female comrade with me was insulted by a hooligan, I rarely went to the open-air theater to see plays or movies. Some female comrades, if they had to go to the street at night, had to be accompanied by several people, or dress up as men, and carry sticks in their hands.

After the "Free Kingdom" was overthrown and a large number of hooligans were arrested, it was truly a great spiritual liberation for us. Regardless of day or night, whether in the office or on the street, we no longer have to be anxious and fearful. How can one who has not experienced the spiritual coercion of the "Free Kingdom" period understand the happiness of an orderly socialist society?

    精神上的解放
    水泥设计院描图员　于萍
    4月24日的夜晚，管庄上空的一钩新月在浮云里时隐时现。微风拂动着柳梢，吹送着海棠的花香。这时候，管庄各机关女工作人员的集体宿舍，只有零零落落的灯光。她们有的在办公室赶着白天尚未作完的工作，有的在给远方的亲人写信，有的正在林荫道上悠闲地散步，从那一阵阵爽朗的笑声中，可以感到她们的心情是多么舒畅。
    没有到过管庄的人，也许以为这是一个平常的暮春之夜。但是，对于我们这些年青的女同志来说，这并不平常，因为能够这样心情舒畅，还是最近几个月的事。
    在“自由王国”时期，管庄的流氓是那样猖狂，在办公室里，在露天剧场，甚至有时在光天化日之下，稠人广众之间公然侮辱女同志。那时候，我们不论在什么时候，到什么地方，都得格外警惕。白天一个人都不大敢呆在办公室里，黑夜更往往是足不出户。记得自从1956年10月的一个晚上在露天剧场，和我一起的一个女同志受了一个流氓的侮辱之后，我就很少到露天剧场看戏看电影了。有的女同志晚上如果必须到街上去，也得有几个人作伴，或者女扮男装，手里还得提着棍子。
    反掉了“自由王国”，逮捕了大批流氓分子以后，对我们来说真是精神上的一大解放，不管白天黑夜，不管是在办公室和在街道上，我们再不要提心吊胆了。没有经受过“自由王国”时期精神上所受的胁迫，怎么能理解有秩序的社会主义社会生活的幸福呢？（附图片）
