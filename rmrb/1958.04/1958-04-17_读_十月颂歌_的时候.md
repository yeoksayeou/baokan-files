    On Reading "Ode to October"
    Liu Lanshan

    On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, people all over the world were jubilant and celebrated in unison. Our people were even more excited, as if it were our own grand festival, everyone cheered, and everywhere was filled with songs of praise and gratitude. In those days, poems, like flowers on the spring earth, blossomed on newspapers, periodicals, and wall posters all over the country, so many that people couldn't see them all or count them all.

    The Beijing Publishing House has compiled nearly a hundred poems published in newspapers and periodicals across the country at that time, praising the October Revolution, praising artificial satellites, and praising the Soviet Union - "Ode to October". This is very meaningful: it expresses the Chinese people's deep love for the Soviet Union, gathers the Chinese poets' tributes to the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, and at the same time has the effect of summarizing experience and promoting prosperity in poetry creation.

    In this joyous festival, many veteran writers who don't usually write poetry have produced many good works, especially Mr. Wang Tongzhao, who, despite his critical illness, still finished the hundred-line poem "Forty Years Ago and Forty Years Later" in one breath, with trembling hands and labored breathing. As for the poets who write poetry regularly, they were even more enthusiastic, writing a lot, quickly and well.

    Some people say that, compared with the previous few years, 1957 was a year of bumper harvest for poetry creation in our country. This is not an overstatement. And I think this collection is the earliest batch of early rice to appear in this year of bumper harvest. Because last year's poetry creation was not only numerous, unmatched by any previous year, but also in terms of the improvement of creative quality and diversification of styles, it was also unmatched by any previous year. Taking this anthology as an example, most of the poems are written by poets who have felt something in real life, and they are the voices of love for the Soviet Union, love for peace, and love for the socialist motherland. However, under the common theme of praising the October Revolution, these poems have their own characteristics. On the one hand, as Comrade Zang Kejia said in the "Preface": "This is because the poets have a deep love for the Soviet Union, and at the same time, they closely link the prosperity and strength of the motherland and their personal happy life with it." On the other hand, I think it is also because after the great anti-Rightist struggle, the poets are more enthusiastic, the style of poetry has been improved to some extent, and the poetry creation circle has truly begun to let a hundred flowers bloom.

    "October" is one of the eternally exciting themes in Chinese poetry creation, it has become the language of life and the language of poetry, and whoever thinks of these two words will feel inspired. And the artificial Earth satellite - the moon, is even more one of the sources of beautiful fantasies for the Chinese people since ancient times. In countless ages, people have created many myths and legends for it, such as Chang'e flying to the moon, Wu Gang chopping the laurel tree, etc., which are gentle and moving, rich and colorful, and have been passed down continuously; this is the genius creation of the Chinese working people, and the spark of ideal that blooms from their real life. And now, when the poets see the red new moon passing over their heads, the new reality and the ancient legends are combined together, the poets are greatly excited, spread their wings of imagination, go up to the sky and down to the earth, and create many beautiful poems. This kind of revolutionary romanticism was not very common in the poetry creation in the previous few years, but it is quite common and prominent in this poetry collection, and I think this is a gratifying feature of it.

    Reading this collection of poems, I feel like I am walking in the autumn fields, with a golden field of crops in front of me, and doves of peace and peace satellites flying and chirping overhead, and the loud mountain songs floating in the wind, and my heart is filled with excitement and joy... I think other readers will have the same feeling as me. Because this is the earliest batch of early rice to appear!

    读“十月颂歌”的时候
    刘岚山
    在十月革命四十周年的时候，全世界人民都欢欣鼓舞、同声庆祝，我国人民更像过自己的大节日一样，人人振臂欢呼，到处洋溢着一片赞颂和感念的歌声。在这些日子里，诗就像春天大地上的花朵一样，盛开在全国各地的报刊上和墙报上，多得叫人看不完、数不清。
    北京出版社编选了当时发表在全国各地报刊上的近百首歌颂十月革命、歌颂人造卫星、歌颂苏联的诗——“十月颂歌”，这是很有意义的：它表现了中国人民对于苏联的深情热爱，汇集了中国诗人对于十月革命四十周年的献礼，同时在诗创作上也有总结经验和促进繁荣的作用。
    在这喜气洋洋的节日里，许多平时不常写诗的老作家，都写出了不少好作品，特别是王统照先生，他在病势垂危中，仍手颤气促地一气呵成了“四十年前与四十年后”的百行长诗。至于经常写诗的诗人们，更是热情澎湃，写的又多又快又好。
    有人说，和前几年比较起来，1957年是我国诗创作的丰收年。这并不是过份的说法。而我以为这个选集就是丰收年最先登场的小早稻。因为去年的诗创作不仅数量众多为过去任何一年所不及，在创作质量的提高上、风格多样化上，也是过去任何一年所没有的。以这个选集来说，绝大部分诗作都是诗人们在现实生活中有所感而发，都是热爱苏联、热爱和平和热爱社会主义祖国的心声。然而，在歌颂十月革命这个共同的主题下，这些诗却又各具特色，这一方面诚如臧克家同志在“序”中所说：“这是由于诗人们对苏联有着热爱的挚情，同时，把祖国的繁荣富强、个人的幸福生活和它紧密地联结在一起。”而另一方面，我以为也是在伟大的反右斗争以后，诗人们的热情更高了，诗风有了某一些改进，诗创作界真正地开始了百花齐放。
    “十月”是我国诗创作中永远激动人心的主题之一，它已经成为生活的语言和诗的语言，谁一念到这两个字的时候，谁都会感到振奋。而人造地球卫星——月亮，更是我国人民自古以来产生美丽幻想的泉源之一，在无数的年代中，人们为它创造了许多神话和传说，如嫦娥奔月、吴刚伐桂等等，娓婉动人，丰富多彩，一直流传不衰；这是我国劳动人民的天才创作，是他们从现实生活中绽开的理想的火花。而现在，当诗人们看见红色新月亮经过自己头顶的时候，新的现实和古老的传说结合在一起，诗人们大为兴奋，展开了想像的翅膀，上天下地，创造了许多美丽的诗篇。这种革命浪漫主义精神，在前几年的诗创作中还不很多，而在这个诗集中却相当普遍和突出，我以为这是它的一个可喜的特点。
    读着这本诗集的时候，我好像走在秋天的田野上，眼前是一片金黄的谷物，头顶上是和平鸽子与和平卫星在飞鸣，嘹亮的山歌随风飘来，心里头充满了激动和喜悦……我想别的读者会和我有同样的感受。因为这是最先登场的小早稻呵！
