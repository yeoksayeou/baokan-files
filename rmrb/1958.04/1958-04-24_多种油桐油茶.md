    Plant Tung Trees and Oil Tea Trees Extensively
    A vigorous greening movement is now being carried out everywhere. Wouldn't it be even more meaningful if the trees we plant could also generate some economic value?
    As far as I know, tung trees and oil tea trees are excellent species, and they have the following advantages: ① The fruits can be pressed for oil, and tea oil can also be used for cooking. ② Cultivation is convenient. As long as the seeds of tung trees or oil tea trees are planted in the soil, forests can grow. There is no need for seedling cultivation or transplantation, which can save labor. ③ They yield quickly. Tung trees can bear fruit in just three years; oil tea trees can also bear fruit in just a few years. ④ The flowers of tung trees and oil tea trees are very beautiful, with a refreshing fragrance, which can beautify the environment and also develop beekeeping. Four birds with one stone, why not do it? I hope all afforestation workers across the country will plant tung trees and oil tea trees!　Gaoyuan

    多种油桐油茶
    现在一个轰轰烈烈的绿化运动已在各地开展起来了。如果使我们栽种的树木还能产生一些经济价值，其意义不更大么？
    据我所知，油桐树和油茶树，是优秀的树种，它们有以下优点：①果实可以榨油，茶油还可供食用。②栽培方便，只要把油桐树或油茶树的种子点在土中，即可长出树林来，不需要育苗、移植，可以节省劳动力。③收效快，油桐树只要三年就能结子；油茶树也只要数年即可结子。④油桐、油茶树的花都很美丽，清香扑鼻，既可以美化环境，还可发展养蜂事业。一举四得，何乐而不为呢？望全国造林者，都来种油桐和油茶树吧！　高原
