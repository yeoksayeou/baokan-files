Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 13th: According to newspaper reports, four thousand rubber planters and workers in southern Thailand jointly wrote a letter to Thai Prime Minister Nai Thanom on the 10th, calling on the government to develop trade with all countries, regardless of camp, to improve the national economic situation. The letter also demanded the abolition of the "embargo" against China.

The letter stated that due to the decline in rubber prices, and Thailand's rubber prices being even lower than those of its neighbors, the rubber industry in southern Thailand is facing difficulties.

The "Democracy Daily" said in an editorial on the 6th that due to the recession in the American economy, the United States' demand for Thai rubber would decrease, and the price of Thai rubber would further decline.

The United States has monopolized Thailand's rubber export trade in recent years, with almost all of Thailand's rubber being exported to the United States.

    泰国橡胶业面临困境
    主张不要单走美国门路
    据新华社13日讯　曼谷消息：据报纸报道，泰国南部四千个橡胶种植者和工人10日联名写信给泰国总理乃他侬，呼吁政府不分阵营地同所有国家开展贸易，以改善国家经济状况，呼吁信并且要求取消对中国的“禁运”。
    呼吁信说，由于橡胶价格下跌，而泰国的橡胶价格比它的邻国还要低，泰国南部的橡胶业面临着困境。
    “民主报”在6日的社论中说，由于美国经济的衰退，美国对泰国橡胶的需求量将会减少，泰国橡胶的价格将会进一步下降。
    美国近年来一直垄断着泰国橡胶的出口贸易，泰国橡胶几乎是全部输往美国的。
