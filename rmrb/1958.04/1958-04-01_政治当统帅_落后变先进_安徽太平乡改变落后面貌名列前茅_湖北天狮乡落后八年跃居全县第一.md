Politics in Command: Backwardness Transformed into Advancement
Taiping Township in Anhui Changes its Backward State and Ranks Among the Best; Tianshi Township in Hubei Jumps from Eight Years of Backwardness to First Place in the County

Our Hefei dispatch: It is essential to ensure that the majority of leading members in a township possess advanced ideology. This is a crucial lesson learned by Taiping Township in Chuxian County, Anhui Province, in its transformation from a backward township to an advanced one.

For a long time, Taiping Township experienced serious backwardness in various tasks. In 1956, only one season of crops was planted throughout the township, and due to poor field management, more than 2,000 mu of planted land was left uncultivated. More than half of the township's 7,000-plus mu of paddy fields were planted as much as two months later than the normal planting season. The labor attendance rate in agricultural cooperatives was only 50%. As a result, the township's grain output in 1956 decreased by more than 15% compared to 1955, and the grain procurement task for 1956 was not fulfilled.

Taiping Township was a revolutionary base area during the Anti-Japanese War, with a fairly solid foundation for its work. Why did it later become backward? After inspecting the township, the Chuxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party concluded that the main reason for the township's backwardness was that right-leaning conservative ideology dominated among the leading members. The township Party committee had thirteen members, nine of whom came from middle peasant, well-to-do middle peasant, or newly-promoted middle peasant families. Influenced by their families' economic status, they developed capitalist ideas, which played a decisive role in their leadership work. Although there had been struggles against these right-leaning conservative ideas within the township Party committee, erroneous opinions often prevailed, and correct opinions could not gain ground.

After identifying the reasons for the township's backwardness, the county committee took many measures to strengthen leadership. In April of last year, the county committee sent Wang Changfa, a member of the county committee, and five other capable cadres to work in the township. At the same time, it convened a general meeting of Party members in the township to launch ideological struggles against leading members with right-leaning conservative ideas, and dealt with them according to the severity of their errors. Subsequently, the township Party committee was re-elected. In this way, advanced ideology gained dominance among the leading members of the township Party committee, and various tasks began to change accordingly. For example, in the spring of 1957, timely transplanting of seedlings was achieved on more than 7,000 mu of paddy fields throughout the township. The total grain output of the township increased by 20% compared to 1956, and the grain procurement task was overfulfilled. Since last winter, the township's work in water conservancy construction, afforestation, fertilizer accumulation, and eliminating the four pests has consistently ranked among the best in the county's twenty-two townships, making it an advanced township in the county.

Our dispatch: According to a report in the Hubei Daily: Tianshi Township in Xuan'en District thoroughly transformed its leadership's ideology and work style, fully mobilizing and relying on the masses, enabling the township's production to leap from a consistently backward state for eight years to the forefront of the county. The township opened up new paddy fields, nearly doubling the county committee's target of one mu per household, setting a county record. Fertilizer accumulation reached two pits per cadre and three pits per household among the masses. Other production activities are also developing rapidly. In this spring's inspection and evaluation by the county and district, the township won eight firsts: first in converting dry land to paddy fields, first in water conservancy construction, first in fertilizer accumulation, first in improving tools, first in cultivating summer crops, first in developing pig raising, first in eliminating the four pests, and first in conserving grain.

Here, the mountains are high and the slopes are steep, and the main grain crop, corn, yields only a hundred jin per mu. Various tasks have consistently been relatively backward. Since the launch of socialist education in the countryside last year, especially the great leap forward in agricultural production, and with the strengthening of leadership by capable cadres sent by the county and district committees, the entire party branch, especially the leading cadres, have raised their awareness, transformed their ideology and work style through party rectification and reform, and achieved thorough and concrete leadership. For example, in converting dry land to paddy fields, some initially thought there was no land to convert, so the cadres personally surveyed, increasing the amount of convertible land from sixty-three mu to more than eight hundred mu. In order to ensure that the conversion was done quickly, well, and economically, the branch also decided that each cadre should take the lead in opening up four fen of land, thereby promptly developing a set of methods for converting land according to local conditions, greatly accelerating the pace and reducing labor by 25% compared to the beginning. In all tasks, Tianshi Township has always paid attention to mobilizing and relying on the masses. The township launched a major debate on why to open up land and how to overcome difficulties in water, fertilizer, and labor, which not only boosted morale, but more importantly, the masses came up with many ways to overcome difficulties. For example, after the issue of slow land opening and insufficient labor was raised, the veteran farmer Chen Tingxiu and the young man Chen Yizhen jointly proposed various suggestions such as using animal power instead of human power, which increased labor efficiency by more than ten times. There have also been great developments in various production activities such as fertilizer accumulation, pig raising, land reclamation, and medicinal planting. (Zhimin, Danhua)

### 政治当统帅　落后变先进  安徽太平乡改变落后面貌名列前茅  湖北天狮乡落后八年跃居全县第一

    政治当统帅　落后变先进
    安徽太平乡改变落后面貌名列前茅  湖北天狮乡落后八年跃居全县第一
    本报合肥讯　在乡的领导成员中，具有先进思想的人必须保证占多数。这是安徽省滁县太平乡从落后乡跃进成为先进乡的一条重要经验。
    太平乡各项工作长期存在着严重的落后现象。1956年全乡只种了一季农作物，由于田间管理不善，种下的田又荒了二千多亩；全乡七千多亩水稻田，有一半比正常播种季节迟种达二个月；农业社的劳动出勤率只有50％。因此全乡1956年的粮食产量比1955年减产15％以上，1956年的统购粮食任务也没有完成。
    太平乡在抗日战争时就是革命根据地，工作相当有基础。为什么后来会变得落后呢？中共滁县县委到这个乡检查后认为：这个乡落后的主要原因是，领导成员中右倾保守思想占了优势。太平乡乡党委有十三个委员，其中九个委员的家庭成分大都是中农、富裕中农和新上中农，由于家庭经济地位的影响，他们滋长着资本主义思想，这些思想在领导工作中又起了决定作用。这些右倾保守思想在乡党委中间虽然有过斗争，但错误的意见经常占上风，正确的意见不能抬头。
    县委找出了这个乡落后的原因后，采取了许多措施加强领导。去年4月，县委下放了县委委员王长发和其他得力干部等六人到这个乡工作。同时又召开了全乡党员大会，向有右倾保守思想的领导成员展开了思想斗争，并根据各个人错误情节的轻重分别给予处理。接着又改选了乡党委会。这样，乡党委会领导成员中先进思想就占了优势，各项工作也随着有了转变。如1957年春季，全乡七千多亩稻田都做到了适时栽秧。全乡粮食总产量比1956年增产20％，粮食统购任务也超额完成了。从去冬到现在，这个乡的兴修水利、造林、积肥和除四害等工作，在全县二十二个乡中一直是名列前茅，成为全县的先进乡。
    本报讯　据湖北日报消息：宣恩一区天狮乡彻底转变领导思想与作风，充分发动、依靠群众，使全乡生产从八年来一贯落后的状态，跃入全县先进行列。全乡新开水田，比县委提出的一户一亩指标超过近一倍，创全县最高纪录。肥料达到干部每人两坑、群众每户三坑。其他各项生产，也正在飞跃发展。今春经县区检查评比时，这个乡得了八个第一：旱改水第一，兴修水利第一，积肥第一，改良工具第一，夏收作物培育第一，发展生猪第一，除四害第一，节约用粮第一。
    这里山高坡陡，主要粮作物苞谷只亩产百把斤。各项工作一贯比较落后。从去年农村开展社会主义教育，特别是农业生产大跃进以来，经县、区委派得力干部加强领导，通过整党整风，支部全体党员首先是主要干部提高了觉悟，转变了思想作风，做到领导深入具体。如旱改水，开始有人认为无地可改，干部就亲自勘察，使可改田由六十三亩增到八百多亩。为了保证改得多快好省，支部又决定干部每人带头开四分田，从而及时研究出一套因地制宜的改田方法，速度大大加快，用工比起初减少25％。在各项工作中，天狮乡始终注意发动群众，依靠群众。全乡开展了一次为什么要开田、怎样克服水、肥、劳力困难的大辩论，不仅鼓足了劲头，更重要的是群众想出许多克服困难的办法。如开田速度慢、劳力不足的问题提出后，老农陈廷秀和青年陈一真共同提出畜力代人力等各种建议，使劳动效率提高十倍多；积肥、养猪、开荒、栽药等各项生产也有很大发展。（志敏、丹华）
