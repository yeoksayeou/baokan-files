    Lightweight and Nimble "Little Bee"
    The "Little Bee" aircraft designed by Soviet designer Antonov has been successfully trial-produced. This aircraft is specifically used for low-altitude, short-distance flights. It does not require any special airfield for takeoff and landing, just a field of 50 to 100 meters long is enough. This new lightweight aircraft is most suitable for national economic departments, and can be used to eliminate agricultural pests, fertilize, and serve geological exploration teams. The "Little Bee" aircraft also has equipment for flying at night and in adverse weather conditions.

    轻便灵巧的“小蜜蜂”
    苏联设计师安东诺夫设计的“小蜜蜂”飞机试制成功。这种飞机专门用作低空短途飞行。它起飞和降落不需要什么专门的飞机场，只要有一个长达五十到一百公尺的场子就够了。这种新的轻便的飞机最适用于国民经济部门，它可以用来消灭农业害虫、施肥、为地质勘探队服务等。“小蜜蜂”飞机还有在黑夜和恶劣气候条件下飞行的设备。
