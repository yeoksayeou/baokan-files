    Digging up the Roots of "Valuing the Past and Belittling the Present"

    "Valuing the Present and Belittling the Past" and "Valuing the Past and Belittling the Present" are two completely opposing directions in the departments of philosophy and social sciences. Our revolutionary cause requires us to "Value the Present and Belittle the Past." But why do so many people "value the past," "admire the past," and "cherish the past"? This cannot but be a thought-provoking question.

    The meaning of "the past" need not be elaborated, since so many people value, admire, and cherish it. Then, what does "the present" mainly refer to? In terms of historical science, in the field of world history, "the present" mainly refers to the history of the struggle between scientific socialism and capitalism since the publication of the "Communist Manifesto" in 1848, and the emergence, development, growth, and strengthening of socialism. "Valuing the present" mainly refers to vigorously studying and summarizing the experiences of the world communist movement over the past hundred years, especially the experiences of the proletariat in achieving great victories in the world since the October Revolution of 1917, as well as the various practical issues in the current struggle between socialism and capitalism, to guide the current proletarian revolutionary struggle. In the field of Chinese history, "the present" mainly refers to the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people in the past hundred years and the history of the socialist revolution. "Valuing the present" mainly refers to vigorously studying and summarizing the various experiences and lessons of the people's revolutionary struggle in our country in the past hundred years, especially the experiences of the Chinese people in carrying out revolutionary struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party since its establishment, to guide the earth-shaking socialist revolution that our people are currently undertaking. The socialist revolution carried out in the economic, political, and ideological fronts since the founding of the People's Republic of China has great world significance, and this should be the main subject of research for the Chinese history science department, and even the entire philosophy and social science department.

    Why do people fail to admire and value the "present," which is so rich and colorful, and so closely related and important to our proletarian revolutionary cause, and instead violate the requirements of social development and "value the past," "admire the past," and "cherish the past"?

    In the past, some people openly used the banner of "scholarship for scholarship's sake" to delve into the intricacies of ancient people and events. Later, this banner became unpopular, so they had to put it away. But secretly, they still followed the old ways: "scholarship for scholarship's sake." There was a professor who had done this for decades. Although he verbally said that he would take Marxism-Leninism as his guiding ideology after liberation, he showed his true colors when he lectured. In the classroom, he could spend an entire class examining one character. What use is this kind of tedious and textual "scholarship" for serving socialism? Isn't the ideology that supports this kind of "scholarship" bourgeois ideology?

    Another kind of "valuing the past" ideology is to escape reality. Many comrades' articles have pointed this out. However, this issue is worth exploring in depth: what kind of reality are they escaping? Where are they trying to escape to?

    Some people say: "It is difficult to engage in current issues. Even if you make mistakes in ancient ethnic issues, you only make mistakes about dead people, and the problem is not big. If you make mistakes in current ethnic issues, the problems involved will be much bigger." In fact, it is precisely because there are too many bourgeois ideas in their minds that they dare not touch socialist ethnic issues, so they avoid them and delve into the past. Obviously, our current reality is the vigorous socialist revolution. Escaping reality is escaping the proletarian revolutionary struggle. Isn't this exactly what the bourgeoisie wants? Isn't this a very clear reflection of the position of those who "value the past and belittle the present"?

    In fact, whether it is "scholarship for scholarship's sake" or escaping reality, it is often because they are very familiar with and love the capitalist and feudalist ways in their hearts, but are incompatible with socialism. Someone lecturing on literary history sighed repeatedly over Zhang Ji's "Ode to a Virtuous Widow," particularly the lines "Returning your pearls, tears fall in twin streams; I regret we did not meet before I married," saying things like "expressing emotions, but adhering to ritual propriety," and "ancient people often used this to compare the relationship between ruler and subject." Not only that, but they also quoted Su Manshu's imitation, "Returning your alms bowl, tears of indifference; I regret we did not meet before I shaved my head," to prove its wonderfulness, praising it endlessly. What else can this kind of mystery prove if not that their thoughts and feelings are too far removed from socialism and the working class? Someone, under the guise of "objective progressive effect," vigorously praised the bourgeoisie during the bourgeois revolution, and even exaggerated Napoleon's "progressive effect" on the Middle East and Near East, completely ignoring the historical inevitability that the bourgeoisie, while showing progressiveness during the anti-feudal period, had already shown the historical inevitability of its demise. On the other hand, when talking about the October Socialist Revolution, they lightly glossed over it with a few adjectives like glorious and great. Isn't it very clear where their preferences lie?

    Thoughts and feelings are not things that exist in a vacuum. Standing on what position, you will naturally have what kind of thoughts and feelings. The essence of "valuing the past and belittling the present" is that they are reluctant to part with capitalism and feudalism, and are deeply in love with them, while they are cold and taciturn about socialism and the working class. Without standing on the position of the working class, how can you have the thoughts and feelings of the working class? And how can you value the "present," which is closely related to the proletarian revolutionary struggle? People with a tendency to "value the past and belittle the present," no matter what the reason, the ultimate root cause of their "valuing the past and belittling the present" is the inevitable result of sitting on the stool of the bourgeoisie or being too far away from the working class.

    To conform to the trend of the times and meet the needs of the people, and to change from "valuing the past and belittling the present" to "valuing the present and belittling the past," the primary issue is to fundamentally move one's position to the side of the working class. Otherwise, even if you use more Marxist-Leninist phrases to decorate your appearance, it is just "gilding the lily"!

    Of course, we absolutely do not mean to completely abandon the "past." The question is what we study the "past" for and how we study it. Engels' book "The German Peasant War" has already set a brilliant example for us. Our only purpose in studying the "past" can only be to serve socialism and the current revolutionary struggle of the proletariat. If our research on the "past" results in praising the emotion of "expressing emotions, but adhering to ritual propriety" in "Ode to a Virtuous Widow," and then touting the feudal relationship between ruler and subject, wouldn't that be serving feudalism, which has long been eliminated? If the result is to praise the "heroic figures" of the bourgeoisie without any criticism, and to praise the progressiveness of the bourgeoisie, wouldn't that be openly opposing socialism today?

    Whether or not we can "value the present and belittle the past" is a question of whether the philosophy and social science departments can serve the great leap forward in production. The economic foundation of our country is already socialist. And "valuing the past and belittling the present" is the main problem existing in the philosophy and social science departments. This problem essentially reflects the serious contradiction between the base and the superstructure. This contradiction is an obstacle to our leap forward. We must immediately resolve this contradiction. The only way to resolve this contradiction has been very clearly indicated to us by the Party, that is, to resolutely overthrow the bourgeois orientation of "valuing the past and belittling the present." The time has come! All forces in the philosophy and social science departments should immediately take action, overthrow their own and others' tendencies to "value the past and belittle the present," fundamentally change their positions, and resolutely implement "valuing the present and belittling the past"!

### 挖掉“厚古薄今”的根

    挖掉“厚古薄今”的根
    “厚今薄古”和“厚古薄今”是哲学社会科学部门中两个完全对立的方向。我们的革命事业要求我们“厚今薄古”。但是，为什么有很多人“厚古”、“喜古”、“怀古”呢？这不能不是一个令人深思的问题。
    所谓“古”，既然有那么多人厚它、喜它、怀它，它的含义自然用不着多说了。那么，“今”主要是指什么呢？就历史科学而言，在世界史方面，“今”主要是指自1848年“共产党宣言”发表以来科学的社会主义与资本主义的斗争和社会主义发生、发展、成长、壮大的历史。“厚今”主要是指大力研究和总结百多年来世界共产主义运动的经验，特别是自1917年十月革命以来无产阶级在世界上取得伟大胜利的经验，以及当前社会主义与资本主义斗争的各项现实问题，用以指导当前的无产阶级革命斗争。在中国史方面，“今”主要是指近百年来中国人民的革命斗争和社会主义革命的历史。“厚今”主要是指大力研究和总结我国近百年来人民革命斗争的各种经验教训，特别是自中国共产党成立以来中国人民在中国共产党领导下进行革命斗争的经验，用以指导我国人民正在进行着的翻天覆地的社会主义革命。中华人民共和国成立以来，在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上进行的社会主义革命，具有伟大的世界意义，这更应该是中国历史科学部门，以至整个哲学社会科学部门研究的主要课题。
    内容如此丰富多采的“今”，与我们无产阶级革命事业关系如此密切、如此重大的“今”，不去喜它，不去厚它，却偏偏要违反社会发展的要求，去“厚古”、“喜古”、“怀古”，这是什么原因呢？
    以前曾经有人公开打着“为学术而学术”的招牌，去钻古人古事的牛角尖。后来这个招牌吃不开了，只得把它收拣起来。但暗地里还是那么老一套：“为学术而学术”。有个教授，过去就是那样干了几十年。解放后虽然口头上说要以马列主义为指导思想，但讲起课来却露了马脚。在课堂上，他考证一个字可以考证一节课。像这样烦琐考证的“学术”，对为社会主义服务有什么用呢？支持这种“学术”的思想难道不是资产阶级思想吗？
    另一种“厚古”的思想是逃避现实。很多同志的文章都指出了这一点。不过，这个问题值得深究：逃避的是什么现实？要逃到哪里去？
    有人说：“搞现实问题很难。搞古代民族问题，即使错了，也只错在死人身上，问题不大。搞现在的民族问题，犯了错误，牵连的问题就大了。”其实正是因为自己脑子里资产阶级思想太多，不敢碰社会主义民族问题，所以避而远之，去钻古代。很明显，我们现在的现实就是轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命。逃避现实就是逃避无产阶级的革命斗争。这难道不正是资产阶级求之不得的事吗？这难道不是很鲜明地反映了“厚古薄今”者的立场吗？
    实际上，无论“为学术而学术”也好，逃避现实也好，往往是因为思想深处对资本主义的、封建主义的那一套很熟悉、很爱，而对社会主义却格格不入的缘故。有人讲文学史对张借的“节妇吟”中“还君明珠双泪垂，恨不相逢未嫁时”两句，唉唉连声，说什么“发乎情，止于礼义”，“古人往往以此比拟君臣”之类，这还不够，又引了苏曼殊仿句“还卿一钵无情泪，恨不相逢未剃时”来证明其妙，赞颂不已。这种奥妙，不是证明思想感情隔社会主义、隔工人阶级太远太远，又作何解释呢？有人在“客观上的进步作用”的帽子下，大肆颂扬资产阶级革命时期的资产阶级，甚至把拿破仑对中近东的侵略所起的“进步作用”也吹得天花乱坠，完全无视资产阶级在反封建时期表现出进步性的同时，就已显示了资产阶级必然消灭的历史必然性。另一方面，讲十月社会主义革命，却在几个光辉呀、伟大呀……的形容词之下轻轻一掠而过。喜好所在，岂不十分清楚吗？
    思想和感情都不是悬空的东西。站在什么立场，自然会有什么样的思想和感情。所谓“厚古薄今”，实质上就是对资本主义、对封建主义恋恋不忘，意浓情深，而对社会主义、对工人阶级冷若冰霜，讳莫如深。没有站在工人阶级的立场上，怎么会有工人阶级的思想感情？又怎么能够对于与无产阶级革命斗争密切相关的“今”厚得起来呢？具有“厚古薄今”倾向的人，无论存在着什么原因，其之所以“厚古薄今”，最终的根源是因为自己的屁股坐在资产阶级的凳子上，或是距离工人阶级太远的必然结果。
    要顺应时代之潮流，符合人民的需要，一变“厚古薄今”而为“厚今薄古”，首要的问题是屁股根本搬家，搬到工人阶级这边来。否则，就是多拿点马列主义词句装点门面，也只是“涂金”而已！
    当然，我们绝没有完全不要“古”的意思。问题在于研究“古”是为了什么，怎么个研究法。恩格斯著的“德国农民战争”一书已经给我们作出了一个光辉的范例。我们研究“古”的唯一目的只能是为社会主义服务，为无产阶级当前的革命斗争服务。如果我们研究“古”的结果是表彰“节妇吟”中“发乎情，止于礼义”的感情，进而标榜封建君臣关系，岂不成了为早已被消灭的封建主义服务吗？如果其结果是毫无批判的歌颂资产阶级的“英雄人物”，歌颂资产阶级的进步性，在今天，岂不等于明目张胆地反对社会主会吗？
    能不能“厚今薄古”是哲学社会科学部门能不能为生产大跃进服务的问题。我们国家的经济基础已经是社会主义的了。而
  “厚古薄今”是哲学社会科学部门中存在的主要问题。这个问题实质上反映了基础与上层建筑的严重矛盾。这个矛盾是我们飞跃前进中的障碍。我们必须立即解决这个矛盾。解决这个矛盾的唯一途径，党已经给我们指示得非常明白，这就是坚决打倒“厚古薄今”这个资产阶级方向。是时候了！哲学社会科学部门的一切力量立刻行动起来，打倒自己的和别人的“厚古薄今”倾向，根本改变自己的立场，坚决贯彻“厚今薄古”！
