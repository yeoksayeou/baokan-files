    When Cerebral Hemorrhage Occurs
    What is commonly called "stroke" is medically termed "cerebrovascular accident." It includes cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral embolism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral vasospasm, etc.; among which cerebral hemorrhage is the most serious and common.
    The most common cause of sudden unconsciousness in the elderly is cerebral hemorrhage. Patients with cerebral hemorrhage often have a history of long-term hypertension and arteriosclerosis. Once blood pressure rises and ruptures the blood vessel wall, cerebral hemorrhage occurs. Common triggers that suddenly raise blood pressure are emotional excitement and excessive exertion.
    Modern medicine cannot yet provide active treatment for cerebral hemorrhage. Current methods are only aimed at quickly stopping the bleeding and gradually awakening the patient. The main (but not necessarily effective) method is to have the patient lie quietly in bed, allowing a blood clot to form at the site of the bleeding to block the rupture. High concentrations of glucose solution are also often injected into the patient to increase the viscosity of the blood, facilitating clot formation. In addition, nursing care is also extremely important.
    When someone experiences cerebral hemorrhage and suddenly falls unconscious, desperately shaking them to try to wake them up is harmful, as shaking can worsen the bleeding. The patient should be kept as quiet as possible, and a doctor should be called immediately.

    当脑出血发生的时候
    俗语所说的“中风”，医学上叫做“脑血管意外”。它包括脑出血、脑血栓形成、脑栓塞、蜘蛛膜下腔出血、脑血管痉挛等；其中以脑出血最严重与常见。
    老年人突然昏倒人事不省的原因，最常见的就是脑出血。脑出血的病人往往有长期高血压和动脉硬化的历史，一旦血压升高冲破血管壁，就脑出血了。使血压突然升高的诱因，常见的是情绪激动和用力过度。
    现代医学对脑出血还不可能作出积极的治疗来。目前所用的种种方法，只是想让病人很快止血和逐渐清醒过来。其中主要（但不一定有效）方法是使病人安静卧床，好让出血的地方能形成血栓把破口堵住。同时还常常给病人注射高浓度的葡萄糖液，增加血液的粘稠度，便于血栓的形成。此外，护理工作也极重要。
    有人发生脑出血突然昏迷不省的时候，拼命摇他，想把他弄醒，这是有害的，因为推摇会使病人加重出血。应当尽量使病人得到安静，立即请医生来看。
