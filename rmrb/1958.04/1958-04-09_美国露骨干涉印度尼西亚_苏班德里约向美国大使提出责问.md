　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The U.S. State Department issued a formal statement on the 7th, further exposing its barefaced interference in Indonesia's internal affairs and supporting the Indonesian rebel group that is currently collapsing.

　　The State Department statement made malicious attacks on the domestic situation in Indonesia and said in a threatening tone that the U.S. government "regretted" that Indonesia was reportedly purchasing weapons from socialist countries to deal with Indonesian armed rebels, which the U.S. approved of.

　　After reading the statement, State Department spokesman White answered reporters' questions and said that the United States did not approve of the Indonesian government's suppression of the armed rebel group. He said, "We (the United States) would like to see (Indonesia's domestic problems) resolved without bloodshed"; the Indonesian government's current approach would not help to resolve the Indonesian problem "in the way the United States would like it to be resolved." White said these words obviously because the situation is getting worse for the rebel group.

　　U.S. news agencies admitted in reports that the State Department statement indicated that the U.S. government had taken a further step in interfering in the Indonesian situation. Prior to this, U.S. Pacific Forces Commander-in-Chief Stump, while testifying at a closed hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 5th, openly expressed his "hope" that Indonesia's anti-communist forces would "come together" to prevent Indonesia from pursuing an independent policy that conforms to its national interests.

　　White's remarks aroused dissatisfaction from the Indonesian government. Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio summoned U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Jones on the 8th to demand clarification of White's remarks, which interfered in Indonesia's internal affairs. The meeting lasted one and a half hours.

　　A delegation composed of twenty-three youth groups from Bandung, after arriving in Jakarta, submitted their resolutions to the Cabinet Prime Minister's Office on the 8th, expressing their support for the government and opposition to foreign interference.

　　The resolutions of the Bandung youth groups also called for the dissolution of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek clique elements, and warned the United States not to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs.

　　Indonesian First Deputy Prime Minister Hardi, when meeting the delegation, said that the government would convey their statement to the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia through certain channels.

    美国露骨干涉印度尼西亚
    苏班德里约向美国大使提出责问
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国国务院7日发表一项正式声明，进一步露骨地干涉印度尼西亚内政，并且替正在溃败中的印度尼西亚叛乱集团撑腰。
    国务院声明对印度尼西亚的国内局势进行恶意的攻击，并且以威胁的口吻说，美国政府“感到很遗憾”，因为有消息说，印度尼西亚政府竟向社会主义国家购买武器来对付美国所赞许的印度尼西亚武装叛乱分子。
    国务院发言人怀特在宣读这项声明以后回答记者问题时还说，美国不赞成印度尼西亚政府镇压武装叛乱集团。他说，“我们（美国）愿意看到（印度尼西亚国内的问题）不经流血而得到解决”；印度尼西亚政府目前的做法不能有助于使印度尼西亚问题“像美国所希望的那样获得解决”。怀特说了这一番话，显然是因为目前形势对于叛乱集团愈来愈不好了。
    美国通讯社在报道中承认，国务院声明表明美国政府已经采取了进一步干预印度尼西亚局势的立场。在这以前，美国驻太平洋部队总司令斯图普5日在美国众议院外交委员会的秘密意见听取会上作证时，公然表示“希望”印度尼西亚的反共势力“聚合在一起”，阻止印度尼西亚奉行符合民族利益的独立政策。
    怀特的谈话引起了印度尼西亚政府的不满，印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约8日召见了美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯，要求澄清怀特所发表的干涉印度尼西亚内政的谈话。会见为时一小时半。
    万隆二十三个青年团体组成的一个代表团在到达雅加达以后，8日把他们的决议交给内阁总理办公厅，表示支持政府和反对外国干涉。
    万隆青年团体的决议还要求东南亚条约组织解散，要求把蒋介石集团分子驱逐出境，并且警告美国不得干涉印度尼西亚内政。
    印度尼西亚第一副总理哈迪在接见代表团时说，政府将通过某些途径把他们的声明转达美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆。
