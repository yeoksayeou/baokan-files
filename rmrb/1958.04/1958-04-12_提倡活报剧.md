    Advocate Living Newspaper Plays
    Li Qin
    Living newspaper plays, like big-character posters, have become weapons for the masses to oppose conservatism and waste, and actively promote socialist ideology. They are not only thematically clear but also diverse in form and style. The Tianjin No. 4 State Cotton Factory has a very common practice of using a few minutes before meetings to perform living newspaper plays, and the content of the meetings is often closely related to the theme of the living newspaper plays. These past two days, this factory held a living newspaper play performance competition. Some professional theater troupes in Tianjin have made demonstration performances of living newspaper plays especially for amateur troupes. Professional theater troupes in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places have also performed many small plays reflecting current events during this period.
    Living newspaper plays are the best theatrical form for rapidly reflecting real life and closely coordinating with political movements. It can meet the requirements of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in creation and is the most ingenious creation of the masses. Theater workers should go among the masses to discover and cultivate amateur writers. Organize this vigorous amateur creative force to promote the rapid advancement of the entire theatrical cause through mass creation. Now is a great time!

    提倡活报剧
    李钦
    活报剧，同大字报一样，已经成为群众反保守、反浪费，积极宣传社会主义思想的武器。它们不仅主题鲜明，形式风格也是多种多样。天津国棉四厂利用开会之前几分钟演出活报剧的风气，非常普遍，而开会的内容往往和活报剧的主题结合很紧。这两天，这个厂举行了活报剧演出比赛。天津市有的专业剧团，特为业余剧团作了活报剧的示范演出。北京、上海等地的专业剧团，这个时期也演出了许多反映时事的小剧本。
    活报剧是迅速反映现实生活、紧密配合政治运动最好的戏剧形式。它能达到创作上“多快好省”的要求，是群众最富有智慧的创造。戏剧工作者应该到群众中去发现和培养业余作者。把这支生气蓬勃的业余创作队伍组织起来，以群众创作来推动整个戏剧事业突飞猛进。现在正是大好时机！
