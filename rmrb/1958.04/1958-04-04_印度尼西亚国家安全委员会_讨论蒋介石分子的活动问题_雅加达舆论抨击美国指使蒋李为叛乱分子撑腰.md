Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 3rd: The Indonesian National Security Council today discussed the activities of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Indonesia.

After attending the National Security Council meeting, Information Minister Sudibjo told reporters that the government would soon announce its position on this issue.

Sudibjo refuted the claim by some foreign journalists that the Indonesian government's opposition to the Chiang Kai-shek clique was tantamount to opposing overseas Chinese in Indonesia. He clearly pointed out that the Indonesian government dislikes the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Indonesia because they secretly undermine the Republic of Indonesia, oppress the Indonesian people, and disrupt Indonesia's peace and security.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 3rd: The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper wrote today that attention should be paid to Li Seung-man's statement expressing his willingness to send an "expeditionary force" to help Indonesian rebels, because it reflects the intentions of his backers.

The newspaper said that the instigator behind the scenes has so far been unable to openly and directly interfere in Indonesia, but its malice is very strong. Therefore, it pushes forward lackeys like Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek to convey its voice and intentions.

"Indonesian Torch" said that if Li Seung-man's statement materializes, there will be a risk of war in the Pacific region. To prevent this disaster from happening, efforts should be concentrated on quickly eliminating the domestic rebel groups.

"Dongxing Daily" said that Li Seung-man, the servant of U.S. imperialism, like Chiang Kai-shek, is plotting to do everything possible to subvert the Indonesian government in order to serve U.S. interests. The newspaper pointed out that the regimes in South Korea and Taiwan cannot exist without U.S. aid.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 2nd: The Indonesian "Independent" newspaper on April 2nd condemned Li Seung-man's public statement to U.S. journalists on April 1st that he was willing to send troops to Indonesia to help the rebels overthrow the legitimate Indonesian government. The newspaper said that this is not only direct and open interference in Indonesia, but also shows Li Seung-man's attempt to incite a war that could set the whole world ablaze.

Antara News Agency commented on Li Seung-man's statement on April 1st, saying that this so-called "president" of South Korea, who lives off the United States, reminds one of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's words: "Let Asians fight Asians." The news agency said that even before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization recently met in Manila, Indonesian authorities in charge had been closely watching the possibility of the Chiang Kai-shek and Li Seung-man cliques helping the rebels.

    印度尼西亚国家安全委员会
    讨论蒋介石分子的活动问题
    雅加达舆论抨击美国指使蒋李为叛乱分子撑腰
    新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚国家安全委员会今天讨论了关于蒋介石集团分子在印度尼西亚的活动问题。
    情报部长苏迪比约在参加了国家安全委员会会议以后对记者们说，政府不久将宣布它在这个问题上的立场。
    苏迪比约驳斥了某些外国记者把印度尼西亚政府反对蒋介石集团分子说成是反对在印度尼西亚的华侨的说法。他明确指出，印度尼西亚政府不喜欢在印度尼西亚的蒋介石集团分子，因为他们暗地里破坏印度尼西亚共和国，压迫印度尼西亚人民，扰乱印度尼西亚的和平和安全。
    新华社雅加达3日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天写道，应该注意李承晚表示愿意派“远征军”来帮助印度尼西亚叛乱分子的谈话，因为这反映了他的后台势力的意图。
    这家报纸说，幕后指使者到目前为止一直还不能对印度尼西亚进行公开、直接的干涉，但是，它的这种恶意是很强烈的。因此，它就推出李承晚和蒋介石这类走卒来传达它的声音和意图。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，如果李承晚的谈话实现，那就会有在太平洋地区发生战争的危险。为了防止这种灾难的发生，应该集中力量来迅速肃清国内的叛乱集团。
    “东星报”说，美帝国主义的仆从李承晚正如蒋介石一样，正在图谋尽一切力量来颠覆印度尼西亚政府，来为美国利益服务。这家报纸指出，南朝鲜和台湾的政权没有美国的援助是不能存在的。
    新华社雅加达2日电　印度尼西亚“独立报”2日谴责李承晚1日对美国记者公开表示愿意派兵到印度尼西亚帮助叛军推翻印度尼西亚合法政府。这家报纸说，这不仅是对印度尼西亚的直接公开干涉，而且显示李承晚企图煽动足以使整个世界燃烧的战火。
    安塔拉通讯社评论李承晚1日的谈话说，这个依靠美国过活的所谓南朝鲜的“总统”，使人回忆起美国国务卿杜勒斯的话：“让亚洲人打亚洲人”。这家通讯社说，早在东南亚条约组织最近在马尼拉开会以前，印度尼西亚负责当局就已经在密切注意蒋介石集团和李承晚集团帮助叛乱分子的可能性。
