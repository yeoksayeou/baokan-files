　　Being a Butler is Hard
　　
　　Spak, who has the nickname of "America's butler in the North Atlantic Group," said on the 18th: "Today, no politician in the East or West wants war." But then, he touted the "importance" of the North Atlantic military group and tried his best to advocate for West German nuclear armament.
　　
　　On the one hand, believing that no one wants war, and on the other hand, believing that military groups and nuclear armament are indispensable, isn't this a huge contradiction? Why is it that Mr. Spak, who considers himself clever and capable, is actually talking so incoherently?
　　
　　The explanation is not difficult. Spak's previous statement was to help his American master cope with international public opinion. Because, at present, there are more and more people condemning the United States' arms race activities. And to achieve this, the old trick of releasing the smoke screen of "Soviet aggression threat" no longer works; so Spak changed to a new method that seemed fair. However, when the United States is engaged in arms race activities, Spak has to cheer and applaud. In this way, he can't help but fall into self-contradiction.

    管家难当
    有着“美国在北大西洋集团的管家”这个外号的斯巴克在18日说：“今天在东方或者西方没有一位政治家会要战争。”但是接着，他又鼓吹北大西洋军事集团的“重要性”，并且竭力主张让西德原子武装。
    一方面相信没有人要战争，另一方面又认为军事集团和核备战是不可少的，这不是一个绝大的矛盾吗？自以为聪明干练的斯巴克先生为什么居然这样语无伦次了呢？
    解释也并不困难。斯巴克说的前一句话是为了帮他的美国主子应付国际舆论。因为，目前谴责美国备战活动的人是越来越多了。而要做到这一点，用放出“苏联侵略威胁”的烟幕这个老手法已经不行了；于是斯巴克就改用了貌似公正的新手法。可是，在美国搞备战活动的时候，斯巴克又不能不捧场喝采。这一来，他当然不能不陷于自相矛盾之中了。
