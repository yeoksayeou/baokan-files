 本报沈阳4日电　Liaoning Establishes Three Thousand Industrial "Experimental Fields"; Over Two Thousand Leading Cadres Move to Workers' Districts

    Our newspaper's dispatch from Shenyang, April 4th: In Liaoning, over one thousand factories and mines have established nearly three thousand "experimental fields," and over two thousand leading cadres have moved their homes to workers' residential areas. This transformation in leadership style has directly promoted rapid development in production and various other tasks.
    In each "experimental field," leading cadres have discovered many significant key problems and, fueled by the "double-anti" movement, have mobilized workers and technicians to initiate a surge in resolving these issues, quickly solving many technically complex and important problems. At the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, in a very short period, over one thousand seven hundred workers exceeded the newly established quotas by one to eight times. Based on this, the factory drafted a leap forward plan to produce four thousand five hundred and thirty-five machine tools this year, an 84% increase over the actual number completed in 1957. The woodworking workshop of the Shenyang Cable Factory, facing a shortage of manpower affecting cable output, saw its production increase by more than 60% because the workshop leader, by working alongside the workers, helped them use waste materials to create three machines for manufacturing wooden spools and shafts for winding cables. When the leaders of these factories and mines went down to the workshops or work teams, they immediately took veteran workers as their masters, starting as ordinary apprentices and advancing towards the "expert" realm. Although the time has not been long, many have initially mastered a technique. Leaders in some factories and mines also regularly invite technicians to teach technical lessons. In some factories and mines, the Party committee secretary and technicians act as each other's mentors; the Party committee secretary asks the technicians to teach technology, and the technicians acknowledge the Party committee secretary as a master in "redness."
    After the leading cadres moved to the workers' residential areas, it also greatly promoted the work of family members and street work. Many family member cadres reported that the work became easier after the leading cadres moved in. Wang Guowen, the Deputy Manager of the Angang Machine Installation No. 6 Company, after moving to a worker's residential area, visited the cadres of the family committee and participated in family member meetings to study the work of eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene. Under his leadership, family members all guaranteed to dig up one jin and two liang of pupae, striving to achieve "four no's and eight cleans." Many public places in the workers' residential areas were very unsanitary, but due to the leading cadres taking the lead in cleaning, they quickly became clean.
    In order to ensure that enterprise cadres can systematically and orderly follow production, engage in "experimental fields," and interact with workers in their spare time, the Party organizations at all levels in some cities have stipulated that certain days of the week are "meeting-free days" for the entire city or enterprise.

    辽宁办了三千块工业“试验田”
    两千多名领导干部搬到工人区
    本报沈阳4日电　辽宁的一千多个厂矿企业，已办了近三千个“试验田”，有两千多名领导干部把家搬到了工人住宅区。这种领导作风的转变，直接促进了生产和各项工作的飞跃发展。
    在各个“试验田”里，领导干部都发现了许多重大关键性问题，并发动工人和技术人员乘“双反”运动之火，掀起解决问题的热潮，使技术复杂的不少重大问题很快得到解决。沈阳机床二厂在很短时间内，有一千七百多名工人突破了新定额一倍到八倍，在这个基础上，订出了全厂今年生产四千五百三十五台机床的跃进计划，比1957年实际完成的台数提高了84％。因为人力不足影响电缆出厂的沈阳电缆厂木工车间，由于车间领导者跟班劳动，帮助工人用废材料制成了三台制造缠电缆的木盘和木轴的机器，使产量提高了60％多。这些厂矿的领导者一下到车间或班组，就拜老工人为师傅，从一个普通徒工开始，向“专”的大门迈进。时间虽然还不长，不少人已初步掌握了一种技术。有些厂矿的领导干部，还定期请技术人员讲授技术课。有的厂矿中党委书记和技术人员互作师徒，党委书记请技术人员教技术，技术人员拜党委书记为“红”的师傅。
    领导干部搬到工人住宅区以后，也大大推动了家属工作和街道工作。不少家属干部反映，领导干部搬来了，工作就好做了。鞍钢机装六公司副经理王国文搬到工人住宅区以后，访问了家属委员会的干部，并参加家属会，研究除四害讲卫生的工作。家属们在他的带动下，人人都保证挖一斤二两蛹，争取做到“四无八净”。有许多工人住宅区公共场所很不卫生，由于领导干部带头打扫，都很快变得清洁了。
    有些市的各级党的组织，为了保证企业干部能有计划有秩序地去跟班劳动、搞“试验田”和在业余时间跟工人接触，规定了全市或全企业每周有几天为“无会日”。
