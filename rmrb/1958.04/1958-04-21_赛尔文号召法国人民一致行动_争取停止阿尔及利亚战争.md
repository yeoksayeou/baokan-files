Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 20th: According to a TASS report from Paris, French communists held a rally in Paris, the French capital, on the 18th. Marcel Servin, secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, delivered a report on the current situation and the tasks of the Communist Party. He pointed out that a government crisis occurred during the parliamentary discussion of the Algerian war and its political and economic consequences. Members of parliament belonging to left-wing parties and groups played a decisive role in bringing down the Gaillard government.

Servin pointed out that the "mediation" representatives of the United States and Britain are attempting to formally establish American rule over Tunisia and the entire North Africa. Their suggestion that Tunisian airports be controlled by American and British troops is clear evidence of this.

Servin emphasized that the main contradiction that must be resolved now is the contradiction between the war in Algeria and the policy of subservience to American imperialism, and the interests of France and the people who demand a swift peace in Algeria. The Algerian war must be stopped. This task should become the basis for the activities of all democratic and patriotic forces during the current government crisis.

Servin called on the working people to unite in action, and appealed to all democratic and patriotic forces to unite in order to end the government crisis. At the same time, he emphasized that the attitude of the Socialist Party is hindering the establishment of a left-wing majority and the formation of a left-wing government. Therefore, it is necessary to strive for united action between Socialists and Communists.

    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国首都的共产党员18日在巴黎集会，法国共产党中央委员会书记马赛尔·赛尔文在会上作了关于当前形势和共产党的任务的报告。他指出，在议会讨论阿尔及利亚战争及其政治、经济后果的时候，发生了政府危机。属于左翼政党和集团的议员在促使盖伊阿政府垮台方面起了决定性的作用。
    赛尔文指出，英美两国“斡旋”代表企图使美国正式建立对突尼斯和整个北非的统治。他们建议突尼斯的飞机场由美国和英国的军队来控制，这就是明证。
    赛尔文着重指出，现在必须解决的主要矛盾，是在阿尔及利亚进行战争以及屈从于美帝国主义这种政策同法国的利益以及同要求迅速在阿尔及利亚实现和平的政策的人民之间的矛盾。必须停止阿尔及利亚战争。这个任务应当成为一切民主爱国力量在目前发生政府危机期间展开活动的基础。
    赛尔文号召劳动人民一致行动，并且呼吁一切民主爱国力量联合起来，以便结束政府危机。同时，他强调指出，社会党的态度在妨碍左派多数的建立和左派政府的成立。因此，必须争取使社会党人和共产党人采取一致行动。
