Visiting a Peace Warrior in a Coconut Grove Temple
Gao Liang

There is such a peace warrior in the world. Last year, he requested to sail in a small boat, facing the raging waves, to Christmas Island to stop the British from testing the hydrogen bomb.

This peace warrior is the famous Sinhalese monk, Secretary of the Ceylon Peace Committee, and winner of the "Strengthening International Peace" Lenin Prize, Saranankara. I visited him in an ancient temple surrounded by coconut groves near Colombo.

Many Ceylonese friends excitedly told me about his life and deeds, and praised him as a patriotic and peace-loving monk. Now that I have met him in person, his firm voice and thin figure remind me of his extraordinary life. He was once imprisoned in India for four years for participating in the anti-British struggle, and hunger emaciated him, almost blinding him. Now this old man in his fifties is still very weak. At this moment, he is draped in a yellow robe, diligently writing "New World," the oldest Sinhalese magazine, under the lamplight. This issue of the magazine will publish articles from people of various countries demanding a meeting of great powers, opposing nuclear weapons testing, and supporting the Algerian struggle. The cover features a photograph of the martyred Djamila Bouhired.

Saranankara used fresh pineapples he planted himself to entertain guests from afar. He grew up in this small temple, and was later sent to India by his master to study Buddhist scriptures. In India, due to the influence of his teacher Tagore and various new ideas, as well as the enlightenment of Indian progressives in prison, he realized that "without the freedom of the motherland, there is no freedom of religion"; Asians must find a way out for their own destiny and unite against the common enemy—the colonial rulers. After serving his four-year prison term, he returned to Ceylon and became the first Sinhalese monk to participate in the anti-British struggle. He wrote a book called "Motherland," calling out to the people. Since the arrival of Western colonists hundreds of years ago, Ceylon, this green and rich island of gems, had been plundered and impoverished. The British forcibly seized land and planted tea and rubber plantations to extract maximum profits, while the Ceylonese people were reduced to slaves for generations. Resistors joined Saranankara in the fight. In the early stages of World War II, he was imprisoned again for opposing the imperialist war. After Ceylon's independence, he continued to strive to ensure the complete withdrawal of British troops from Ceylon, and to defend peace and the people's good life.

He enthusiastically told me about the development of the peace movement of the Ceylonese people. One touching thing was that when the World Peace Council held a meeting in Colombo last year, thousands of Ceylonese people spontaneously launched a peace fundraising campaign on trains and buses, in temples and villages. A poor farmer in Matara, thirty-seven years old, donated her only penny to him, saying, "For the sake of my children, please work hard for peace."

I asked him to talk about his determination to go to Christmas Island last year to oppose the British testing of the hydrogen bomb. He said, "I knew at the time that Britain would not stop the test because of my actions alone. I thought, if I sacrificed myself on Christmas Island, the people of the world would hate atomic weapons even more; if I was injured and still alive, I would go around the world with disabilities and scars to tell the people of the world how harmful atomic weapons are, and people would fight with greater determination against atomic weapons testing." He told his friends about this plan at the time. Enthusiastic friends spread the word, and within a few days, fifty-four people, including monks, youth, and farmers, came to sign up, asking to go to Christmas Island with him. Knowing this news, the cunning British rulers, fearing the opposition of the people of the world, secretly conducted the test in May, advancing it from the originally announced date in August.

Saranankara spoke with extreme indignation about the United States' plan to test the hydrogen bomb in the Pacific this April. He said, "This is a crime, and the Ceylonese people resolutely oppose it." "This side of the Pacific belongs to Asians, and Asians will never allow the United States to spread death ash in the Asian seas." He believes that the people of the world will resolutely rise up to stop this crime of the United States. The Ceylon Peace Committee will also extensively organize the people in the future and adopt various methods to oppose the US test. When talking about the fact that the forces of peace obviously outweigh the forces of war, he said excitedly, "The Asian and African countries are united with the Soviet Union and China, and world peace is guaranteed. Our government supports the people's peace movement. We Ceylonese people know how to cherish peace." As he said this, tears of excitement welled up in his eyes.

This reminded me of how, a few days ago, when Soviet Peace Committee Chairman Tikhonov presented him with the "Strengthening International Peace" Lenin Prize at the Colombo City Hall, he gave a moving speech. He attributed this honor to the peace-loving people of Ceylon. He said, "I will devote my weak remaining life to fighting against war and defending peace to the end." The day after the award ceremony, villagers near the small temple erected arches on the path in front of the temple with wooden frames, coconuts, and pineapples, beat drums, danced the ancient Kandy dance, and came to gather in the wind and rain to warmly congratulate Saranankara. They stood in the wind and rain for a long time without leaving. Tikhonov pointed to the wind and rain at the time and said poetically, "The wind and rain wash the nature, peace stirs the hearts, like the sound of thunder spreading all around, the bell of peace has resounded throughout the world." The peace-loving people of Ceylon are taking advantage of the strong east wind to surge forward in a wave of peace from the South Indian Ocean. (Attached photo)

    椰林古庙访和平战士
    高梁
    世界上有这样一位和平战士，去年他要求驾一叶扁舟，迎着惊涛骇浪，奔赴圣诞岛去阻止英国试验氢弹。
    这位和平战士就是锡兰的著名法师、锡兰和平委员会秘书、“加强国际和平”列宁奖金获得者撒拉南卡拉。在科伦坡近郊椰林环抱的一座古庙里，我访问了他。
    许多锡兰朋友兴奋地向我谈起他的生平事迹，并且誉他为爱国爱和平的法师。如今我见到他本人，那坚定的语声和瘦弱的身形，使我想起他的不平凡的一生。他曾经在印度因参加反英斗争而被监禁达四年之久，饥饿折磨得他瘦骨嶙峋，双目几乎失明。现在这位五十多岁的老人身体仍很虚弱。此刻，他正披着黄色袈裟孜孜不倦地在灯光下编写着一家最老的僧伽罗语杂志“新世界”。这期杂志将登载各国人民要求举行大国会议、反对核武器试验和支持阿尔及利亚斗争的文章，封面上有受难的加米拉·布伊海德的照片。
    撒拉南卡拉用他亲手种植的鲜菠萝来招待远方来客。他在这座小庙里长大，后来被师父送到印度去学佛经。在印度由于他的老师泰戈尔和各种新思潮的影响，以及在监狱中印度进步分子对他的启发，他认识到，“没有祖国的自由，就没有宗教的自由”；亚洲人要为自己的命运找出路，就必须联合起来反对共同的敌人——殖民统治者。四年监禁期满后，他回到锡兰，成了锡兰和尚中参加反英斗争的第一人。他写了“祖国”一书，向人民呼唤。自从几百年前西方殖民者到来后，这绿色富饶的宝石之岛的锡兰被劫掠得一贫如洗。英国人用强力圈去土地，种满了为攫取最大利润的茶园和橡胶园，锡兰人民却世世代代沦为劳役的奴隶。反抗者同撒拉南卡拉一起投入战斗。在第二次世界大战前一阶段，他因反对帝国主义战争再度被关入监狱。锡兰独立后，他继续为使英国军队完全撤出锡兰、为保卫和平和人民美好生活而奋斗不懈。
    他热情地向我谈了许多关于锡兰人民的和平运动的发展过程。其中有一件动人的事情是：去年世界和平理事会在科伦坡举行会议的时候，成千成百的锡兰人在火车和公共汽车上，在庙宇和村庄里自发地展开和平募捐运动。马塔里有一位三十七岁的穷苦农妇向他捐出自己仅有的一文钱，说：“为了我的孩子，请你们多多为和平工作吧。”
    我请他谈谈去年他决心赴圣诞岛反对英国试验氢弹的情形。他说：“我当时知道，英国并不会因为我一个人的行动而停止试验。我这样想，如果我在圣诞岛牺牲，全世界人民将会对原子武器更加憎恨，万一我受伤而还活着，我将带着残疾和伤痕，到世界各地去，告诉全世界人民，原子武器是这般祸害人，人们将会以更大的决心，为反对原子武器试验而斗争。”当时他把这种打算告诉给他的朋友们。热心的朋友们把这件事传了出去，不几天，就有和尚、青年、农民等五十四人前来报名，要求和他一起到圣诞岛去。狡猾的英国统治者知道这个消息后，害怕世界人民的反对，偷偷摸摸地把原来宣布在8月进行的试验提前在5月间进行了。
    撒拉南卡拉极为气愤地谈到美国今年4月要在太平洋上试验氢弹的事。他说：“这是罪行，锡兰人坚决反对。”“太平洋这岸是亚洲人的，亚洲人决不允许美国在亚洲的海洋上散布死灰。”他相信全世界人民将坚决起而制止美国的这一罪行。锡兰和平委员会今后也将广泛地组织人民，采用各种方式来反对美国的试验。在谈到目前和平力量显然已超过战争势力时，他激动地说：“亚非国家同苏联、中国团结一起，世界和平就有了保障。我们政府支持人民的和平运动。我们锡兰人民知道如何珍惜和平。”他说到这里，眼内闪动着激情的泪花。
    这使我回忆起前些日子苏联保卫和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫在科伦坡市政大厅授奖仪式上把“加强国际和平”列宁奖章交给他的时候，他发表了动人的演说。他把这荣誉归功于爱好和平的锡兰人民。他说：“我将尽我微弱的余生，为反对战争、保卫和平而斗争到底。”在授奖仪式后的第二天，小庙附近的村民用木架、椰子和菠萝在庙前的通道上搭起拱门，打着鼓，跳着古老的康提舞，在风雨中前来集会，向撒拉南卡拉热烈庆贺。他们伫立在风雨中久久不去。吉洪诺夫当时指着风雨富有诗意地说：“风雨洗涤着大自然，和平激荡着人心，像那雷雨声弥漫着四周，和平的钟声已响彻全球。”爱好和平的锡兰人民正从南印度洋掀起的一股和平浪潮，趁着强劲的东风，汹涌前进。（附图片）
