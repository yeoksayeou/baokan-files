Jiangxi Successfully Transforms Red Soil

    (Our report) Jiangxi Province has successfully transformed and utilized large areas of red soil wasteland. The province plans to transform and utilize 4.5 million mu of red soil during the Second Five-Year Plan.

    Jiangxi Province has already transformed and utilized 2 million mu of red soil wasteland. These lands now grow well with dozens of crops such as wheat and rapeseed.

    Red soil lacks organic matter, has low phosphorus content, high acidity, and poor water and fertilizer retention capacity. In the past, farmers called it "a piece of copper when the weather is clear, and a bag of pus when it rains," a "barren land." In 1950, staff from state-owned farms and agricultural science workers first reclaimed 800 mu in Nanchang County to trial planting cotton and castor beans. Because the fertilization was not appropriate, the result was that only 5 jin of cotton was harvested per mu, and there was no harvest of castor beans. The following year, they learned from their lessons and sent cadres to Jinxian, Fengcheng, and other places to investigate and study the long-term experience of farmers using red soil on a small scale. After repeated research and experimentation, they selected crops such as peas, sweet potatoes, and rye that are tolerant of barrenness, drought, and acidity for planting, and applied farmyard manure, as well as lime and chemical fertilizers, to increase the organic matter in the soil. The third year, various farms promoted this experience, and the results were very good. For example, planting sweet potatoes in newly reclaimed red soil yielded 1,400 jin per mu. The highest wheat yield reached 120 jin. Jiangxi currently has 15 million mu of wasteland, more than 90% of which is red soil. Therefore, improving and utilizing red soil is of great significance for developing agricultural production in Jiangxi.

    江西改造红色土壤成功
    本报讯　江西省大面积改造和利用红色土壤荒地成功。全省规划在第二个五年计划内改造、利用红壤四百五十万亩。
    江西省现在已经改造和利用起来的红壤荒地有二百万亩。这些土地上，现在生长着很好的小麦、油菜等数十种农作物。
    红壤缺少有机质、含磷量少、酸度高、保水保肥力弱，农民过去称它是“天晴一块铜、下雨一包脓”的“不毛之地”。1950年国营农场的工作人员和农业科学工作者首先在南昌县开垦了八百亩试种棉花、蓖麻。因为施肥不适当，结果棉花每亩只收五斤，蓖麻没有收获。第二年他们接受了教训，派干部到进贤、丰城等地调查研究农民长期小面积利用红壤的经验。又经过反复研究、试验，选择耐瘠、耐旱、耐酸的豌豆、甘薯、黑麦等农作物种植，施用农家肥料以及石灰、化肥等以增加土壤的有机质。第三年各农场便推行了这一经验，结果效果很好。如在新垦的红壤中种甘薯，每亩收到一千四百斤。小麦最高达到一百二十斤。江西现有一千五百万亩荒地中，90％以上是红壤。因此，改良、利用红壤对发展江西农业生产有重大意义。
