Pushing ahead with close planting of rice is a key point in the production leap forward in many southern provinces this year. However, today's news from Guangdong tells us that transplanting early rice according to close planting requirements is not enough to say that the obstacle is cleared. According to their analysis, another major obstacle that follows is how to prevent lodging. Their experience is worth taking seriously. Perhaps all places where early rice is grown will have to overcome this obstacle, or perhaps after overcoming this obstacle, there will be a second or third obstacle, and the ways in which various places overcome these obstacles may be very different. These issues require the comrades concerned to think carefully about.

The comrades in Guangdong are paying close attention to every link in guiding production, and are able to make in-depth and practical analyses as production goes through different stages, discover problems, and bring them to the masses in a timely manner for resolution. In this way, the realization of advanced production increase targets is effectively guaranteed!

    逢关闯关
    推行水稻密植是今年南方许多省生产大跃进中的一个关键。但是，今天广东这个消息却告诉我们说，早稻按照密植要求插了秧还不算过了关。根据他们分析，随之而来的另一个大关是怎样防止倒伏。他们的经验很值得重视。也许这一关好多种早稻的地方都要过，也许过了这一关又还有第二关、第三关，而各地怎样过关的情况还极可能不一样，这些问题，十分需要有关的同志仔细想想。
    广东的同志在领导生产中一个一个环节都扣得很紧，能随着生产的不同阶段作深入踏实的分析，发现问题，及时提到群众面前来解决，这样，便有效地保证了先进增产指标的实现！
