    Party Committees Strengthen Leadership and Adopt Positive Measures
    Jiangsu's Agricultural Middle Schools Consolidate in Development
    “A Spring Rain Overnight, A Garden of Flowers in Full Bloom”: 5,668 Private Middle Schools Developed in the Province in Twenty Days

    (Our newspaper reporter Wei Wenhua reports) The private agricultural middle schools in Jiangsu Province, which the masses call "a spring rain overnight, a garden of flowers in full bloom," have developed to 5,668 schools in the twenty days up to the 10th of this month, with 6,614 classes and more than 282,500 students enrolled. Now, Party committees at all levels in the province are taking positive measures to strengthen leadership from all aspects and consolidate the work in development.

    The vast majority of private agricultural middle schools and other vocational middle schools in Jiangsu Province have already started classes, while some are still in the process of opening. Party committees at the township level lead the schools, generally establishing and improving school affairs committees composed of representatives from the Party, the Communist Youth League, agricultural cooperatives, and teachers. Township Party committees assign special cadres to manage agricultural middle schools and other cultural and educational undertakings. Township Party committees grasp school planning and the ideological work of teachers and students' parents, so that problems can be solved at any time. The Communist Youth League organizations in various counties and townships in the Yangzhou area are also playing a role in the establishment and consolidation of agricultural middle schools, assisting Party committees in carrying out political and ideological work among students and leading students to establish student unions, class meetings, and study groups within the schools to ensure the progress of teaching work. After this new type of school was established, the masses were not very accustomed to it. Party committees at the township level once again led a wide range of publicity supplements, combining production to publicize the significance, principles, objectives, methods, and prospects of running agricultural middle schools among students, parents, and cadres, consolidating the masses' understanding of the schools, and overcoming doubts. After the opening of two agricultural middle schools in Shiqiao Township, Hanjiang County, some students took a wait-and-see attitude, and some were absent without leave. After the township cadres repeatedly publicized the significance of agricultural middle schools at production meetings and political lessons in the school, and the teachers visited students and students' parents to conduct ideological investigation and education, all the originally admitted students reported to class, and more than twenty days later, another thirty-five new students took supplementary examinations and were admitted, and now the number of students has increased by more than 27% compared with the first enrollment. The masses in Hanwang Township, Tongshan County, initially had no confidence in the four agricultural middle schools established, and some students smoked, laughed, and lay down in class. After the township Party committee discovered this, it mobilized cadres and teachers to focus on conducting another supplementary lesson for the masses and students on whether they could learn knowledge and the prospects, and the situation quickly improved. Because the schools were newly established, they were simple and crude, and some people felt that they were not decent. All localities continued to publicize the principles of running schools diligently and thriftily and that agricultural middle schools are run, managed, and supported by the masses themselves, establishing a correct understanding of agricultural middle schools among students and the masses and studying with peace of mind.

    Many new problems have arisen in the business of newly established schools, and various localities are gradually solving them. Regarding the layout of the schools, some are too concentrated, making it inconvenient for students to attend school, and research is being conducted to appropriately decentralize classes; in some areas, two middle schools have been established separately at the junction of two townships, and adjustments are being studied to save manpower and material resources; in some places, students of agricultural middle schools are processed according to the principle of convenience of schooling to transfer to schools nearby. Schools that opened earlier have initially formulated student rules based on the rules and regulations of ordinary middle schools and agricultural cooperatives to ensure both learning and production order. School textbooks are temporarily compiled and taught by local prefectural and county committees or school teachers themselves. The textbooks organized and printed by the Provincial Department of Education are already being transported and distributed. Regarding an important issue related to the consolidation of schools, which is the transfer and training and improvement of teachers, various localities are also accelerating solutions. Now, all parts of the province have selected full-time or part-time teachers from high school graduates participating in labor, transferred cadres, agricultural technology promotion stations, township Party committees, etc., and appropriate adjustments are being made within the county or district range where the region is unbalanced. The Provincial Department of Education has recruited a group of high school graduates participating in labor in the culturally developed southern Jiangsu region for short-term training and sent them to Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and other regions in northern Jiangsu to serve as teachers. Some of this year's graduates from several higher normal colleges have been sent to agricultural middle schools to participate in internships. More than 2,000 of the current graduates of secondary agricultural technical schools in the province have also been assigned to agricultural middle schools to concurrently serve as teachers of agricultural knowledge courses, which are most needed, combining labor, teaching, and technology promotion. The existing agricultural middle school teachers generally lack teaching experience, and the relevant leading departments are currently mobilizing relevant universities and middle and primary school teachers in rural areas to provide guidance on the one hand, and conducting training during non-class time on the other. Many counties are also planning to run short-term training courses to prepare for the rotation training of agricultural middle school teachers, and the five higher normal colleges in the province have decided to mobilize 2,100 teachers in the near future to provide regular training.

    党委加强领导　采取积极措施
    江苏农业中学在发展中巩固
    “一夜春雨，满园花开”，二十天全省发展民办中学5，668所
    本报讯　记者魏文华报道：江苏省群众称为“一夜春雨，满园花开”的民办农业中学，到本月10日止的二十天中已发展到五千六百六十八所，计六千六百一十四班，有二十八万二千五百多名学生入学。现在全省各级党委采取积极措施，从各方面加强领导，在发展中进行巩固工作。
    江苏省民办农业中学和其它职业中学，绝大部分已开学上课，部分的正在开学。各地乡党委会领导学校，普遍建立和健全由党、团、农业社教师等方面代表组成的校务委员会，乡党委会配备专门干部管理农业中学和其它文教事业，乡党委抓学校规划，教师和学生家长的思想工作，做到有问题随时解决。扬州等专区各县、乡的共青团组织，也在农业中学的创办和巩固中发挥作用，协助党委在学生中间进行政治思想工作，在校内领导学生建立学生会、班会、学习小组，保证教学工作的进行。这种新型的学校创办起来后，群众不大习惯，各地乡党委会再度领导开展一次广泛的宣传补课，在学生、家长和干部中间，结合生产宣传有关举办农业中学的意义、方针、目的、办法、前途等问题，巩固群众对学校的认识，克服怀疑情绪。邗江县施桥乡两所农业中学开学后有些学生抱试试看和观望态度，部分的不请假缺席，经过乡里干部在生产会议上和学校讲政治课的时候多次宣传农业中学的意义，教师登门访问学生和学生家长，进行思想摸底和教育，原来考取的学生全部报到上课，二十多天中又有三十五个新学生补考入学，现在人数比第一次招生发榜时增加27％多。铜山县汉王乡的群众，开始时对办起来的四所农业中学没有信心，部分学生上课时吸烟、嘻笑仰卧，乡党委发现后发动干部和教师，着重从能否学到知识和前途等方面对群众和学生再进行一次补课，情况很快地好转。学校初办起来因陋就简，部分群众觉得不像样，各地都根据当地情况继续宣传勤俭办学和农业中学群众自办、自管、自养的原则，在学生和群众中间树立对农业中学的正确认识，安心学习。
    学校新创办，业务上有许多新问题，各地正在逐步解决。对学校的布局，有的过分集中，学生上学不便，研究适当地分散设班；有的乡与乡交界处两乡分别设立两所中学，正研究调整，节省人力物力；有的地方农业中学的学生，按上学便利原则办理转学手续，到近处学校上学。开学较早的学校参照普通中学和农业社的规章制度，从保证学习和生产两方面初步制订了学生守则，巩固教学和劳动秩序。学校教材，临时由各地地委、县委或学校教师自己编印讲授，省教育厅组织有关部门赶编赶印的教材已在运输发放。对关系到学校巩固的一个重要问题，是师资的调集和培养提高，各地也在加速解决。现在全省各地都就地从参加劳动的高中毕业生、下放干部、农业技术推广站、乡党委会等方面选拔了专职或兼职教师，地区上不平衡的正在县或专区范围内适当调剂。省教育部门在文化较发达的苏南地区，已招收一批参加劳动的高中毕业生加以短期训练，派到苏北徐州、淮阴等地区去担任教师。几个高等师范今年应届毕业生，有一部分派到农业中学去参加实习。全省中等农业技术学校的应届毕业生，也有二千多人分配到农业中学兼任最需要的农业知识课教师，边劳动，边教课，边结合生产推广技术。现有的农业中学教师，一般没有教学经验，目前有关领导部门正在一方面发动有关高等学校和在乡村的中、小学教师进行辅导，一面利用不上课的时间进行训练，许多县也在筹办短期训练班，准备轮训农业中学教师，全省五个高等师范院校决定在最近调集二千一百个教师予以定期训练。
