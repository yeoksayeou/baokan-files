    Emphasize the Present and De-emphasize the Past
    Bai Sheng
    Comrade Chen Boda's slogan "Emphasize the Present and De-emphasize the Past, Learn While Doing" has shaken the academic and educational circles like spring thunder. This revolutionary slogan removes people's ideological shackles such as emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present, cherishing the past and belittling the present, and makes it possible to achieve a real great leap forward in academic and scientific research work by riding the long wind and breaking through thousands of miles of waves.
    In the past, in the fields of philosophy and social sciences, there was a serious tendency of "emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present" in teaching and scientific research. Among scholars, experts and teachers, a kind of argument prevailed that only engaging in ancient things is valuable and is scholarship, while modern things are common sense and not much scholarship. Some people even compared ancient things to "strong tea" and modern things to "weak water." This kind of thought has also deeply influenced students and young researchers, lecturers, etc. For example, some teachers and students in the philosophy department talk with relish about ancient Greece and Rome, and about Kant and Hegel, but talk very little about modern philosophical thought. Some teachers and students in the history department and the Chinese department talk with relish about ancient history and classical literature, but are incompatible with socialist realism and modern history.
    What is the essence of this thought of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present? First of all, it is scholarship for the sake of scholarship. It is necessary to study ancient things, and many textual research works are also necessary. But all work must have its purpose, and the purpose is to be useful to contemporary people. Spending a lot of effort on ancient things without a purpose, this kind of academic thought of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present is bourgeois academic thought. This kind of thought must be criticized and resolved. Secondly, it is to escape reality. Because things in real life are alive and moving forward, and without real talent and practical knowledge and a dialectical materialist way of thinking, one is bound to run into snags if one wants to connect with reality. What's more, some people have been detached from reality for a long time, and in this era of socialist revolution, many problems are simply unclear to them, and they cannot consider problems from reality. These two kinds of thoughts hinder the progress of scientific research.
    In the socialist era, academics and science must serve the construction of socialism, and must serve the promotion of productive forces. Therefore, theory must be combined with practice, and we must emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past, and learn while doing. To do this, we must work hard, and people who pursue fame and fortune are unwilling to take this path. But it must be recognized that only by not avoiding difficulties and hardships and paying the price of hard work can we achieve relatively significant achievements. There are no other shortcuts.

    要厚今薄古
    柏生
    陈伯达同志提出的“厚今薄古，边干边学”的口号，像春雷一样震惊着学术、教育界。这一革命口号，解除了人们厚古薄今、怀古鄙今等的思想束缚，有可能乘长风破万里浪地在学术科学研究工作方面来一个真正的大跃进。
    过去，在哲学和社会科学方面，教学和科学研究工作中，都有严重的“厚古薄今”倾向。在学者专家教师中流行着一种论调，认为只有搞古代的东西才有价值，才是学问，现代的东西是常识性的东西，学问不大。甚至有人把古代东西喻为“浓茶”，把现代东西喻为“淡水”。这种思想也深深地影响着学生和青年的研究人员、讲师等。例如哲学系有些师生一谈起古希腊、罗马，谈起康德、黑格尔就津津有味，而对现代哲学思想则谈得很少。历史系和中文系有些师生，一谈起古代史、古典文学就津津有味，而对社会主义现实主义和现代史则格格不入。
    这种厚古薄今的思想实质是什么呢？首先，是为学术而学术。研究古代的事情是必要的，许多考证工作，也是必要的。但是一切工作，必须有它的目的性，目的就是为了有用于今人。对古代的东西，花很大力气，无目的地去研究，这种厚古薄今的学术思想，是资产阶级学术思想。这种思想必须批判必须解决。其次，是逃避现实。因为实际生活中的东西是活的，是前进着的，没有真才实学和辩证唯物主义的思想方法，要联系实际，就必然要碰钉子。何况有些人长期脱离实际，在这社会主义大革命的时代，许多问题也简直弄不清，他也就不可能从实际出发考虑问题。这两种思想妨碍着科学研究的前进。
    在社会主义时代，学术、科学一定要为建设社会主义服务，要为促进生产力服务，那就理论必须和实际结合，要厚今薄古，边干边学。要这样作，就要艰苦奋斗，追求名利的人是不愿意走这条道路的。但是必须认识，只有不避艰难困苦，付出辛勤劳动的代价，才能有比较重大的成就，其他捷径是没有的。
