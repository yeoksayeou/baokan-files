Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd dispatch from Kuala Lumpur: In Selangor, central Malaya, more than forty tin mines have ceased production, including two large mines with dredges. Approximately one thousand six hundred miners have been laid off from these mines.

Another report says that approximately one hundred tin mines in Perak, Kedah, Perlis, and Wellesley Province in northern Malaya have also ceased production for the same reason, resulting in the unemployment of approximately three thousand six hundred workers. Among these mines, eight are large mines with dredges.

As previously reported, due to the recession in major capitalist countries, the reduction in tin consumption and the drop in tin prices have been affected. The International Tin Council attempted to stabilize tin prices by formulating production quotas to reduce the production volume of tin-producing countries. This method did not eliminate the tin industry crisis but instead caused many tin miners in tin-producing countries to suffer unemployment.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, April 24th: Pakistan's wool exports, which rank third in terms of foreign exchange earnings, after cotton and jute, are facing serious difficulties due to the economic crisis in the United States and other capitalist countries.

The Pakistan Wool Merchants Association said in a memorandum to the Pakistani government that since the beginning of this year, wool prices have fallen by about 50%. In the past six weeks, Pakistani wool exporters have not been able to find buyers abroad.

The memorandum continued, "We fear that this year, Pakistan's foreign exchange earnings from wool and goat hair will not exceed 40 million rupees, while last year's amount was 100 million rupees."

More than nine-tenths of the wool produced in Pakistan is exported, of which more than 60% is purchased by the United States, and more than 30% is purchased by the United Kingdom.

    危机症祸延原料供应国
    马来亚锡矿卷起一片倒风
    巴基斯坦羊毛找不到买主
    据新华社23日讯　吉隆坡消息：在马来亚中部的雪兰峨州，已经有四十多家锡矿停止生产，其中有两家是拥有铁船式采矿机的大矿场。这些矿场的矿工约一千六百人被裁去。
    另有消息说，马来亚北部霹雳、吉打、玻璃市等州和威利斯莱省共有约一百家锡矿已经由于同样的原因停止了生产，约有三千六百个工人因此失业。这些矿场中有八家是拥有铁船式采矿机的大矿场。
    前已报道，由于主要资本主义国家生产衰退，影响到锡消费的减少和锡价的下跌。国际锡业理事会企图通过制订生产限额来削减锡产国的生产量的办法，来稳定锡价。这个办法没有消除锡业的危机，却使锡产国的很多锡矿工人遭受失业的痛苦。
    据新华社卡拉奇24日电　巴基斯坦在获取外汇方面数额仅次于棉花和黄麻而居第三位的羊毛出口，由于美国和其他资本主义国家的经济危机，面临着严重的困难。
    巴基斯坦羊毛商协会在致巴基斯坦政府的一项备忘录中说，自今年年初以来，羊毛价格已经下降约50％。在过去六星期中，巴基斯坦羊毛出口商在国外找不到买主。
    备忘录接着说，我们担心，今年巴基斯坦从羊毛和山羊毛获取的外汇额将不超过四千万卢比，而去年的数额为一万万卢比。
    巴基斯坦生产的羊毛有十分之九以上是向国外输出的，其中60％以上是美国购买的，30％以上是英国购买的。
