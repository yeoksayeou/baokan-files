    Spring Orchid
    Yang Wangjun
    The orchid is one of the oldest and most renowned perennial flowers in China. As early as three thousand years ago, China's great patriotic poet Qu Yuan wrote in his "Chu Ci" the lines "Orchids and angelica are fragrant in their seclusion." In other classical literary poems, the orchid is even more universally praised by poets.

    Orchids mostly grow on the mountains and in the dense forests halfway up the hills. Around the time of the Qingming Festival, it is the peak blooming season for spring orchids. Potted orchids, around three hundred years ago, were popular in the Jiangnan region, especially in major cities like Shanghai and Hangzhou. Besides its fragrance, the orchid's appearance is also unique. The most common spring orchid has petals resembling bamboo leaves. However, in some rare varieties, some petals resemble plum blossoms, some resemble the soon-to-open Huang Kou daffodil, and others resemble the petals of summer lotus flowers. The most precious are the "butterfly petals" with half of the secondary petals or the labellum being white with purple-red spots, and the "plain heart orchid" with a pure white tongue petal. Generally cultivated, there are about forty or fifty varieties.

    Among the more famous spring orchid varieties are the "Song Mei" and "Lü Ying" in the plum blossom petal category. Their petals are round and full, the color is emerald green, and the flower stalks are long, blooming above the leaves, with a very moving demeanor. In the daffodil petal category, there are "Cui Yi Pin" and "Shi Yuan," whose flower appearance is comparable to the above two varieties, with slightly slender petals. Famous varieties of lotus petal orchids include "Da Fugui" and "Cui Gai He." Their petals are about three or four fen wide, truly resembling lotus flowers blooming in spring. Butterfly petal varieties are the rarest, including "Su Die" and "Wucai Hudie," with flowers smaller than the above two categories, exceptionally delicate. The best plain heart varieties are "Yue Pei" and "Wen Tuan Su," with two secondary petals spreading flat, green and white interspersed, simple and elegant. Among the forty or fifty precious spring orchids, plum blossom petals are the most numerous, accounting for more than half, while butterfly petals are the fewest, only two or three varieties.

    Orchids are abundant south of the Yangtze River, with a wide distribution area. They can be found in the mountains of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and the southern part of Anhui provinces, with Zhejiang province having the most detailed records. The main reason why orchids are abundant in Jiangnan is that the average winter temperature in this area is above three degrees Celsius, therefore they are rare in the north and more difficult to cultivate.

    Potted orchids are not as difficult as some people imagine, but their maintenance is more meticulous than that of ordinary potted flowers. In autumn and winter, they should be protected from frost and snow, and in summer, they should be shaded from the sun. The soil used for potting must be loose and well-drained, and it should be kept moderately moist and dry, with fresh air circulation. It should also be kept away from coal smoke, which can cause them to wither. For daily watering, fresh water must be used, and orchid lovers in Jiangnan are accustomed to using rainwater. As long as we pay attention to these aspects in cultivation, we need not fear not being able to grow orchids.

    春兰
    杨汪均
    兰花在我国是一种最古老的，负有盛名的宿根花卉。远在三千年前，我国的伟大爱国诗人屈原，在他写的“楚辞”中便有“兰芷幽而有芳”的词句。在其它古典文学的诗词中，兰花更普遍地被诗人歌咏着。
    兰花，多生长在那崇山峻岭，树林茂密的半山腰里。每当清明节前后，正是春兰盛开的时候。至于兰花的盆栽，约在三百年前，即盛行于江南一带，尤其沪杭各大城市更多。兰花除了它具有清香之外，它的姿色也与众不同。平时最常见的一种春兰，花瓣像竹叶。但在一些稀有的品种中，有的花瓣像梅花；有的像将要开放的黄口水仙；也有的像夏天的荷花花瓣。最珍奇的是副瓣或捧心一半白色，上有紫红斑点的“蝴蝶瓣”和舌瓣是纯白色的“素心兰”。一般培养的，大约有四、五十种。
    春兰品种中较为著名的有梅瓣中的“宋梅”和“绿英”，它们的花瓣团而圆，色翠绿，花梗长，开于叶面上，风姿颇为动人。水仙瓣中有“翠一品”和“十圆”，花容与上述两种不相上下，瓣略瘦长。荷花瓣名种有“大富贵”和“翠盖荷”。它们的花瓣阔约三、四分，真似荷花春开。蝴蝶瓣品种最少，有“素蝶”、“五彩蝴蝶”，花朵较上述两类小一些，秀丽非凡。素心种以“月佩”和“文团素”两种最佳，两个副瓣平展，绿白相间，素雅可爱。在四五十种珍贵春兰中，以梅瓣较多，约占半数以上，以蝴蝶最少，只二、三种。
    兰花盛产于长江以南，分布地区很广。在四川、贵州、湖南、湖北、浙江、江苏和安徽两省的南部，各山区都有，以浙江一省在记载上较详尽。兰花之所以盛产于江南，主要是这一带冬季气温平均在摄氏三度以上，因此在北方很少，培养也较困难。
    关于兰花的盆栽，并不像一般人所想像的那样难，不过它比普通盆花的养护要细致一些罢了。秋冬应防霜雪，夏日应蔽荫。盆栽用土须疏松，排水良好，经常保持燥湿适中，空气流通而清新。还应同煤烟隔绝，有了煤烟会变枯萎。平日浇水须选用淡水，江南爱兰者习用雨水。只要我们在养护上能注意这些，便不怕栽不活兰花。
