    Workers' Poems
      The April issue of "Poetry Magazine" published one hundred outstanding poems created by forty-six workers. Most of these worker-authors have only recently started writing poetry. They brought the working class's heroic spirit and revolutionary drive in building socialism to the poetry magazine with an optimistic, bright, simple, and healthy style.
    These one hundred worker poems come from workers in various industries such as machine tools, coal mines, iron mines, railways, automobiles, textiles, telephones, construction, farms, and transportation. The authors are from Beijing, Shanghai, and provinces and cities in Northeast, East China, and Central South China. These poems vividly reflect the face of the motherland's industrial Great Leap Forward and the workers' rich and colorful lives and struggles.

    工人的诗
      “诗刊”4月号发表了四十六位工人创作的一百首优秀诗歌。这些工人作者大部分都是新近才开始写诗的，他们用乐观、明朗、朴素、健康的笔调把工人阶级建设社会主义的豪迈情绪和革命干劲带上了诗刊。
    这一百首工人诗作出自机床、煤矿、铁矿、铁路、汽车、纺织、电话、建筑、农场、搬运等各行各业的工人的手笔，作者遍及北京、上海和东北、华东、中南各省市。这些诗歌生动地反映了祖国工业大跃进的面貌和工人们丰富多采的生活和斗争。
