    Learning from Lenin's Revolutionary Style
    — Commemorating the Eighty-Eighth Anniversary of Lenin's Birth

    Lenin was a proletarian revolutionary teacher filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and possessing an overwhelming spirit. Studying his life and career will provide us with endless wisdom and strength. Lenin's revolutionary style should also be something we study. Today, we will only raise a few issues that should be learned from this aspect to commemorate the eighty-eighth anniversary of his birth.

    We must learn Lenin's style of being loyal to Marxism and creatively treating Marxism. Lenin was the most loyal student of Marx and Engels, and any attempt to "revise" or distort Marxism was absolutely intolerable to him. Lenin's entire revolutionary activity was carried out under the guidance of Marxism. As Krupskaya said, Lenin often "consulted" Marx. Whenever the revolution was at the most difficult turning point, he always re-read Marx's works repeatedly, seeking instructions to correctly solve the urgent problems of the current revolutionary movement. However, Lenin did not simply and invariably apply the words and sentences in Marx's works, divorced from the specific circumstances of the time. Lenin believed that Marxists should take into account the vivid practical life, the precise facts in reality, and should not adhere to yesterday's theories, because theories can only point out the basic things and can only roughly include the complex situations in practical life. Therefore, Lenin also said: "We do not regard Marx's theory as something immutable and inviolable." The reason why Lenin became Lenin lies in his pioneering spirit of innovation and his revolutionary style of daring to act. Those who regard Marxism-Leninism as final and unchangeable, and thus lag behind practical life, are people who do not have Lenin's style.

    We must learn Lenin's style of daring to put forward lofty ideals to promote and accelerate the development of the revolutionary movement. Lenin believed that at the beginning of the revolutionary movement, a lofty ideal should be put forward to inspire the will of the masses and encourage people to strive to promote and accelerate the development of the movement. Some people have opposed this revolutionary ideal as fantasy, saying that Marxists "have no right to fantasize at all." For this reason, Lenin wrote more than once: "We must fantasize!" "If he is not a hopeless philistine, he must fantasize." Lenin especially could not tolerate the habit of hesitating and being lazy when the revolutionary opportunity was ripe. He said: "Waiting is a crime against the revolution," "Delay is tantamount to seeking one's own death." Those who, on the issues of revolution and construction, do not dare to move forward bravely when the objective environment has shown that it is possible to realize a lofty ideal, and always think that slow is better than fast, should especially learn from Lenin's style.

    We must learn Lenin's style of boldly, courageously, and firmly eliminating the old and supporting the new. Lenin pointed out that when new things are just born, old things are still relatively powerful for a considerable period. Marxists should carefully study and try their best to support new things. Although some of the new seedlings will inevitably die, life itself will select the most vital things from those new seedlings. Lenin especially pointed out: "Ridicule of the weakness of the sprouts of new things, expression of the skeptical attitude of frivolous intellectuals, etc. - these are actually the means used by the bourgeoisie to fight against the proletariat, and they are protecting capitalism against socialism." Lenin regarded the two different attitudes towards new things as a class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. In this struggle, the proletariat should eliminate the dying old things with an indomitable and unstoppable spirit; it should support the new things with an attitude of extra care and attentiveness. Those who are intimidated by the temporary superiority of the old things before their death and dare not overthrow them, those who despise the softness of the new things when they first appear and are unwilling to support them, and those who are listless in supporting the new and destroying the old, are people who do not have Lenin's style.

    We must learn Lenin's style of daring to adhere to principles and not concealing his own views. Lenin believed that "a policy of principle is the only correct policy." In order to adhere to principles, he did not conceal his views under any circumstances. Even when the majority of people did not have a principled position, he did not hesitate to stand on the side of principle to oppose the opinions of the majority, and even dared to oppose the opinions of the whole alone. Those who know that others are wrong but dare not stand up to conduct principled debates, those who have a bellyful of opinions but do not speak face-to-face and talk nonsense behind their backs, are people who do not have Lenin's style.

    Lenin's style is the style of the proletariat and the style of communism. This style is a style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and daring to take responsibility for the sake of promoting the cause of communism.

    学习列宁的革命风格
    ——纪念列宁诞辰八十八周年
    范若愚
    列宁是充满革命热情和具有排山倒海气概的无产阶级革命导师，学习他的生平事业会使我们获得无穷无尽的智慧和力量。关于列宁的革命风格，也应当是我们学习的一个方面，今天我们只从这个方面提出几个应当学习的问题，以纪念他的八十八周年诞辰。
    我们要学习列宁的那种忠于马克思主义和创造性地对待马克思主义的风格。列宁是马克思和恩格斯最忠实的学生，任何企图“修正”、歪曲马克思主义的企图，都是他绝不能容忍的。列宁一生的革命活动，都是在马克思主义的指导下进行的。正如克鲁普斯卡娅所说，列宁是经常“请教”马克思的。每当革命处在最困难的转变关头，他总是重新反复地阅读马克思的著作，寻求正确解决当前革命运动迫切问题的指示。但是，列宁并不是撇开当时的具体情况，简单地、不变地搬用马克思著作中的词句。列宁认为，马克思主义者应当估计到生动的实际生活，现实中的确切事实，而不应当拘守昨日的理论，因为理论只能指出基本的东西，只能大致包括实际生活中的复杂情形。因此，列宁又说：“我们并不把马克思的理论视为一成不变和神圣不可侵犯的东西。”列宁之所以成为列宁，正在于他有这种推陈出新的独创精神，和敢作敢为的革命风格。那些把马克思列宁主义看成是最终的、不能发展的，因而使自己落后于实际生活的人，就是没有列宁风格的人。
    我们要学习列宁那种敢于提出远大理想以促进和加速革命运动发展的风格。列宁认为，在革命运动开始的时候，应当提出一个远大的理想，用以鼓舞群众的意志，使人们努力来促进和加速运动的发展进程。曾有人把这种革命的远大理想说成是幻想而加以反对，说什么马克思主义者“根本无权幻想”。为此，列宁曾不止一次地写道：“要幻想！”“如果他不是毫无希望的庸夫，他必须幻想”。列宁尤其不能容忍那种在革命时机成熟的紧要关头而踌躇不前和懒散从事的习气，他说：“等待就是对革命犯罪”，“拖延就等于自寻死路”。那些在革命和建设问题上，当客观环境已经显示出有可能实现一个远大理想的时候，还不敢勇往直前，总认为慢比快好的人，特别应该好好地向列宁风格学习。
    我们要学习列宁那种大胆、勇敢、坚定地消灭旧事物和扶助新事物的风格。列宁指出，当新事物刚刚诞生出来的时候，旧事物在相当长时期内还是比较强有力些。马克思主义者应当仔细研究和尽力扶助新事物。虽然新事物幼芽中也有些不免会死亡，但是生活本身会把那些新幼芽中最富有生命力的东西选择出来。列宁特别指出：“讥笑新事物的幼芽的软弱，表示轻浮知识分子怀疑态度等等，——这实际上都是资产阶级用以反对无产阶级的斗争手段，都是保护资本主义来反对社会主义。”列宁把对于新事物的两种不同态度，看作是资产阶级同无产阶级之间的阶级斗争。无产阶级在这一斗争中，应该以所向披靡和势如破竹的气慨，去消灭即将死亡的旧事物；应该以加倍爱护、殷情照顾的态度去扶助新事物。那些慑服于旧事物死亡前的暂时优势而不敢去推翻它的人，那些轻视新事物在初出现时的柔软而不愿去扶助它的人，那些对于扶新灭旧萎靡不振的人，就是没有列宁风格的人。
    我们要学习列宁的那种敢于坚持原则，毫不隐蔽自己观点的风格。列宁认为“原则的政策是唯一正确的政策”。他为了坚持原则，在任何情况下，都不隐蔽自己的观点，就是在多数人没有原则立场的情况下，他也是毫不犹豫地站在原则方面来反对多数人的意见，甚至敢于独自一人去反对全体的意见。那些明知别人不对，也不敢挺身而出进行原则争论的人，那些自己有满肚子意见，但当面不讲，背后乱说的人，就是没有列宁的风格的人。
    列宁的风格，是无产阶级的风格，共产主义的风格。这种风格就是为了促进共产主义事业而敢想、敢说、敢干、敢当的风格。
