How to Consolidate Private Schools?
Fujian Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department Holds On-Site Meeting in Putian

(Our Correspondent Lin Junqing reports) With the masses’ enthusiasm for running schools at an unprecedented high level and a large number of private primary and secondary schools developing, how should we implement the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical results," ensuring that each school established is consolidated? The Propaganda Department of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Putian from the 5th to the 7th, focusing on discussing this issue. Participants in this meeting included the heads of propaganda departments of various regions (cities) and the heads of education sections (bureaus) of some counties.

From late March to the present, more than 7,700 private primary and secondary schools have been established in Fujian Province, with a student population reaching over 314,000. These schools were developed based on the needs of the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the masses' demand for learning, and the relatively good educational foundation of Fujian Province, where the problem of teachers can be basically solved. In developing private schools, most areas have been led by the Party committee secretary, with the entire Party mobilized and the masses involved, and have adopted teaching forms adapted to production.

However, due to the rapid development of private schools, ideological mobilization in some schools has not been sufficiently in-depth, and some specific problems in running the schools have not been properly resolved. More than two-thirds of the teachers have no teaching experience, so some people have doubts about whether the schools are standardized and whether they can be consolidated. The meeting analyzed these situations and believed that the current focus should be on vigorously grasping the consolidation of private schools, achieving the goal of the entire Party and all the people running schools, and consolidating each school as it is developed.

The meeting decided to take effective measures to consolidate private schools. The first is to continue to conduct in-depth ideological education for teachers, students, and the masses, publicizing the policies, nature, and tasks of private schools, in order to correct the understanding of the masses, establish a new learning attitude among students, and strengthen the dedication of teachers to serving the people. The second is to strengthen the leadership of private schools, requiring county and grassroots Party committees to discuss the work of private schools and to have a secretary responsible for leading them; the cultural and educational departments should focus on the ideological work of teachers and the guidance of teaching business; improve the school management committee, train the leading backbone of private schools, and gradually equip private secondary schools with Party member principals. The third is that each county should run teacher training classes, organize teaching and research groups in groups, and take measures such as public schools leading private schools to improve the teaching ability of teachers in private schools. In the near future, each county should convene a meeting of teachers from private schools to carry out ideological mobilization, explain methods, and organize counseling. In addition, each private school should establish an attendance and examination system, conduct student code education, establish learning order, and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and frugality, relying on the masses to gradually solve the school's equipment problems.

    如何巩固民办学校？
    福建省委宣传部在莆田召开现场会议
    本报讯　记者林俊卿报道：在群众办学的积极性空前高涨、民办中小学大量发展的情况下，如何贯彻多快好省方针，做到办起一校巩固一校？中共福建省委宣传部5日至7日在莆田召开现场会议，着重讨论这一问题。参加这个会议的，有各地（市）委宣传部长和部分县的教育科（局）长。
    从3月下旬到现在，福建省各地已办起七千七百多所民办中小学，学生数达到三十一万四千多人。这些学校是在工农业生产跃进的需要、群众对学习的要求和福建省原来教育基础较好、师资问题基本上能够解决的情况下发展起来的。各地在发展民办学校中，大都是党委书记挂帅，全党动手，发动群众，并采取了适应生产的教学形式。
    但由于民办学校发展快，有些学校思想动员不够深入，办学中的一些具体问题尚未得到妥善解决；教师队伍中有三分之二以上没有教学经验，因此有些群众对学校是否正规化、能否巩固等抱有怀疑。会议分析了这些情况，认为当前应大力抓民办学校的巩固工作，做到全党、全民办学，发展一校巩固一校。
    会议决定采取有效措施来巩固民办学校。首先是继续深入对教师、学生和群众进行思想教育，宣传民办学校的方针、性质和任务，以端正群众的认识，树立学生新的学习态度和加强教师为人民服务的事业心。其次是加强对民办学校的领导，要求县和基层党委要讨论民办学校工作，要有一个书记负责领导；各文教部门要抓教师的思想工作和教学业务指导工作；健全学校管理委员会，培养民办学校的领导骨干，民办中学要逐步配备党员校长。第三是各县要举办教师训练班，分片组织教研组和采取公立学校带民办学校的办法等来提高民办学校教师的教学能力。在最近期间内各县要召开一次民办学校教师会议，进行思想动员、交代办法和组织辅导。此外，各民办学校要建立考勤考试制度，进行学生守则教育，建立学习秩序，并发扬艰苦奋斗、因陋就简精神，依靠群众逐步解决学校设备。
