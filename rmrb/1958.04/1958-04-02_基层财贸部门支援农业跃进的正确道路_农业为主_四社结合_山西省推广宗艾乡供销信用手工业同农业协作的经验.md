This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 1st: The supply and marketing, credit, and handicraft cooperatives of Zong'ai Township, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, and the thirteen agricultural cooperatives in the township have adopted the method of "four combinations" to comprehensively collaborate and support the great leap forward in agricultural production. Recently, the Yuci District Committee and Yuci Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Communist Party held an on-site meeting in this township to summarize and promote this experience.

The experience of Zong'ai Township's financial and trade departments in collaborating to support agricultural production is a further new development of the past "three-combination contract" (supply and marketing, credit, and agricultural cooperatives). Its combination is based on the agricultural cooperative as the main focus, with supply and marketing, credit, and handicraft departments all oriented towards agricultural production to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. This advanced experience adopts methods such as the "Four Cooperatives Collaboration - Knowing a Year in Advance" chart and the formulation of "Three-to-One Combination Contracts" to comprehensively balance the business plans of financial and trade departments, and then fully collaborate to support agricultural production. The benefits of this approach are: 1. It closely combines the entire township's production, supply, and sales plans in the form of contracts, enabling them to collaborate and leap forward together; 2. It achieves "knowing the numbers for supply and marketing, having a basis for lending, and having production targets," overcoming the uncoordinated phenomena such as mutual "buck-passing" and the dissipation of forces in the past; 3. It enables supply and marketing, credit, and handicraft cooperatives to understand each other's resources, facilitating comprehensive collaboration.

In order to realize the plan for a great leap forward in agriculture, Zong'ai Township put forward requirements to the financial and trade departments for production, supply of means of production, and resolution of production funds. However, the agricultural support plans formulated by the various financial and trade departments were far from adapted to the situation of the great leap forward in agriculture: the agricultural cooperatives' requirements for means of production exceeded the supply plan of the supply and marketing cooperative by more than 50%; the agricultural cooperatives' sales plan for agricultural and sideline products also exceeded the purchase plan of the supply and marketing cooperative by nearly 100%. There were also shortcomings in the support for agricultural production between the various financial and trade departments, such as engaging in isolated efforts and lack of mutual contact.

After analyzing this contradictory situation and the reasons for its occurrence, the Zong'ai Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first organized a guiding group for financial and trade work to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, unifying the leadership of the township's handicraft cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives. It quickly dispatched more than 30 employees to go deep into the thirteen agricultural cooperatives throughout the township to conduct a careful "fact-finding" work. First, they investigated the various production targets, agricultural product varieties, and quantities of each agricultural cooperative, found out what materials were needed to achieve agricultural production increases this year, what agricultural and sideline products needed to be promoted, and when. Then, the material supply plan and promotion plan of the financial and trade departments were determined; secondly, they found out the financial revenue and expenditure of each agricultural cooperative this year and their needs in terms of funds, and then determined the loan plan of the credit department, the loan time, and rationally allocated the funds.

After the needs of the agricultural cooperatives were determined, each financial and trade unit formulated its own business plan according to these requirements. The Zong'ai Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party comprehensively integrated the plans of various units and designed a "Four Cooperatives Collaboration - Knowing a Year in Advance" statistical table. On this table, you can see the production increase targets, increase measures, and income and expenditure of each agricultural cooperative in the township this year. It can also indicate the purchase, sales plan, supply plan and savings and loan plan formulated by the three cooperatives of supply and marketing, credit, and handicrafts according to the needs of agricultural production. From then on, the plans of the financial and trade departments formed a unified collaborative whole. In order to implement the spirit of collaboration and ensure the smooth realization of the various plans of the four cooperatives, a "Three-to-One (supply and marketing, credit, handicrafts to agricultural cooperatives) Combination Contract" was created. This contract includes the annual quarterly contractual relationship between agricultural cooperatives and the other three cooperatives. The "Three-to-One Combination Contract" not only solved the problem of agriculture being the main focus, but also gave the grassroots financial and trade departments a clear service direction. Therefore, there is no clear service direction if there is only “four combinations” without “three-to-one"; strength is not concentrated if there is only "three-to-one" without "four combinations".

In the coordination and balancing process, the isolated operation of commerce by the financial and trade departments was also criticized, and the idea of serving the great leap forward in agricultural production was established. Liaison meetings of the heads of the four aspects of agriculture, supply and marketing, handicrafts, and credit cooperatives were held to overcome the uncoordinated phenomena in support of agricultural production caused by mutual misunderstanding.

Now, due to comprehensive collaboration, not only has the production materials and funds needed for this year's production by the agricultural cooperatives throughout the township been reliably guaranteed, but also the production materials and funds needed during the spring plowing period have been met. In January and February, the production materials supplied to farmers by the supply and marketing cooperatives and the local product material loans issued by the credit cooperatives both increased by more than two times compared with the same period last year. Thanks to the development of collaboration, not only has agriculture been well supported, but also the financial and trade work of the entire township has changed its backward state, and has been unified and actively acting under the goal of serving the great leap forward in agriculture. In addition to increasing more than 20 kinds of new commodities according to the requirements of the farmers, the employees of the supply and marketing cooperatives also tried to purchase various goods that adapted to the historical habits of the local farmers. Because the handicraft cooperatives carried out collaboration with the supply and marketing cooperatives, they overcame the phenomenon of "buck-passing" in the past, and focused on improving product quality, and carried out a competition to guarantee quality, guarantee quantity, guarantee time, guarantee repair, and guarantee exchange.

    基层财贸部门支援农业跃进的正确道路
    农业为主　四社结合
    山西省推广宗艾乡供销信用手工业同农业协作的经验
    本报太原1日电　山西省寿阳县宗艾乡供销、信用、手工业合作社和全乡十三个农业社采用“四结合”的办法，全面进行协作，支援农业生产大跃进。最近，中共榆次地委和榆次专署在这个乡举行现场会议，总结推广这项经验。
    宗艾乡财贸部门协作支援农业生产的经验，是过去“三结合合同”（供销、信用和农业社）的进一步新发展。它的结合是以农业社为主，供销、信用和手工业等部门面向农业生产，支援农业生产大跃进。这项先进经验，采用“四社协作一年早知道”图表和订定“三对一结合合同”等办法，综合平衡财贸部门的业务计划，然后全力协作支援农业生产。这种做法的好处是：一、把整个乡的产、供、销计划，运用合同形式使它紧密地结合起来，互相协作，一齐跃进；二、做到“供销有数、放贷有底、生产有目标”，克服了过去互相“扯皮”和力量抵消等不协调现象；三、可使供销、信用和手工业合作社互摸家底，便于全面协作。
    宗艾乡为实现农业大跃进的计划，向财贸部门提出了生产、供应生产资料和解决生产资金等要求。但是，各财贸部门制订的支援农业计划，却远不适应农业大跃进的形势：农业社对生产资料的要求，超过供销社供应计划的50％以上；农业社农副产品销售计划也超过供销社收购计划将近一倍。各个财贸部门之间在支援农业生产上也存在着孤立的各搞一套、互不联系的缺点。
    中共宗艾乡党委分析了这种矛盾的情况和产生的原因以后，首先组织了一个财贸工作支援农业生产大跃进指导小组，把全乡的手工业社、供销社和信用合作社统一领导起来。并很快派出三十多名职工分头深入到全乡十三个农业社里，进行了认真的“摸底”工作。首先调查了各个农业社各项生产指标、农产品品种和数量，摸清了农业社今年实现农业增产跃进措施，哪些物质需要供应，有什么农副产品需要推销，都在什么时候，然后确定财贸部门的物资供应计划和推销计划；其次摸清各农业社今年的财务收支状况和他们在资金方面的需要，然后确定信贷部门的贷款计划，贷款时间，合理分配资金。
    农业社的需要定下来以后，各财贸单位根据这些要求订出自己的业务计划，中共宗艾乡党委综合各家计划，设计出一种“四社协作一年早知道”统计表，这张表上，可以看到全乡各农业社今年的增产指标、增产措施和收支情况，还可以表明供销、信用、手工业三个社依据农业生产跃进需要，所制订出来的购、销计划、供应计划和存贷计划。从此，财贸部门的计划组成了一个统一的协作的整体。并且为了贯彻协作精神，保证四种合作社的各项计划顺利实现，还创造了一种“三对一（供销、信用、手工业对农业社）结合合同”。这种合同，包括了农业社和另外三个社全年分季的合同关系。“三对一结合合同”，不仅解决了以农业为主的问题，而且使基层财贸部门有了明确的服务方向，因此，只有“四结合”，没有“三对一”，服务方向不明确；只是“三对一”，没有“四结合”，力量不集中。
    在协作平衡过程中，还批判了财贸部门孤立经营商业的做法，树立了为农业生产大跃进服务的思想，并且举行农业、供销、手工、信用社四方面互通情况和要求的社主任联系会议，克服了由于互不了解而造成的支援农业生产上的不协调现象。
    现在，由于全面协作，不但使全乡农业社今年生产所需要的生产资料和资金有了可靠的保证，而且使春耕期间需要的生产资料和资金也得到了满足。1、2月份，供销社供应农民的生产资料和信用社发放出的土产资料贷款，均比上年同期增加了两倍以上。由于开展协作，不但很好地支援了农业，也使全乡财贸工作改变了落后面貌，统一在为农业大跃进服务这个目标下积极行动起来。供销社的职工，除根据农民要求增加了二十多种新商品，并设法去采购回各种适应本地农民历史习惯的货物。手工业社由于和供销社开展协作，克服了过去“扯皮”现象，专心为提高产品质量，开展了保质、保量、保时、保修、保换竞赛。
