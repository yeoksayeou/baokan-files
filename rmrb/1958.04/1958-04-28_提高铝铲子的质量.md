    Improve the Quality of Aluminum Shovels
    In December of last year, I bought an aluminum shovel for stir-frying produced by the Tianjin Xinxing Factory from a department store. After using it for only a few days, the head of the shovel first bent, and then it broke. In January and March of this year, I bought two more, and the same thing happened. Although aluminum shovels are not expensive, it is still wasteful. I hope that Xinxing Factory will improve product quality to meet consumer needs.

    提高铝铲子的质量
    去年12月，我在百货商场买了一把天津新兴工厂生产的炒菜用的铝制铲子，用不了几天，先是铲头弯了，后来就断掉了。今年1月、3月，我又先后买了两把，还是一样。虽然铝制铲子的价钱不贵，但也是浪费。希望新兴工厂改进产品质量，以满足消费者的需要。
