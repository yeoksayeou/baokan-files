Hold More Recitation Meetings
　  Qu Bo
    Recently, I attended a literary recitation meeting jointly organized by the Central People's Broadcasting Station's Broadcasting Drama Troupe and the Poetry Journal.
    The meeting recited about thirty ancient and modern poems, fables, and novels from China and abroad. Although there were no agile dances, melodious music, or tortuous dramatic plots, the magic of the reciters' language deeply touched people's hearts.
    The recitation meeting was like a blooming garden, a surging wave, a symphony of labor, and a battle bugle; rich, colorful, novel and moving.
    When I heard the recitation of "Tracks in the Snowy Forest," I felt that the reciter accurately expressed my innermost feelings. He helped me tell everyone this story of praising the heroes of our time. At this time, I thought of the many excellent poems and novels written by poets and writers. How wonderful it would be if they could all be spread through the voice of reciters!
      Recitation is the most effective art form to reach the masses, while being concise and full of combat effectiveness. It cannot be replaced by other art forms. In radio stations, in factories, in the countryside, in streets, on construction sites, in military camps, in schools... whether it is thirty people, twenty people, or three thousand people, two thousand people; and whether there is one hour of time or ten minutes of time, it can be carried out well. Poems, fables, short stories, essays, as long as they have been worked on by the reciter, can be recited.
    Writers and poets should establish close ties and cooperation with our recitation team. The reciter is one of the bridges connecting poets and writers with the masses; through him, the works are more widely penetrating the masses; through him, words are turned into sounds; through him, illiterate masses and busy people who have no time to read can read books.
    Recitation is a relatively advanced art form. Therefore, reciters also need to have a higher level, first of all, to fully understand the thoughts and feelings of the work, which requires hard work. Secondly, there is a strong artistic expression ability. That night, the recitations of the comrades of the Central Broadcasting Drama Troupe all showed certain achievements. May our recitation army grow stronger in the high tide of the socialist Great Leap Forward of the motherland, and recite more and better poems for the broad masses.

    多办几次朗诵会
　  曲波
    最近，我参加了一次中央人民广播电台广播剧团和诗刊社联合举办的文学朗诵会。
    会上共朗诵了约三十篇古今中外的诗、寓言和小说。这里虽然没有轻捷的舞姿、悠扬的音乐，和曲折的戏剧情节，但朗诵者语言的魔力，却深深地扣住了人们的心弦。
    朗诵会像是怒放的百花园，奔腾的波涛，劳动的交响乐，战斗的军号；丰富多彩，新颖动人。
    当我听到朗诵“林海雪原”时，我觉得朗诵者准确地说出了我的心音。他帮助我把歌颂我们时代英雄的这个故事讲给大家听了。这时，我联想到诗人和作家们所写的许多优秀诗篇和小说，如果都能够借助朗诵者的声音传播出去，那该多好！
      朗诵是最能深入群众，而又短小精悍和富有战斗作用的艺术形式。它不是别的艺术表现形式所能代替的。在电台、在工厂、在农村、在街道、在工地、在军营、在学校……，不论是三十人二十人，还是三千人两千人；也不论有一点钟的时间，还是十分钟的时间，它都能很好地进行。诗、寓言、短篇小说、小品文，只要经过朗诵者的劳动，都可以朗诵。
    作家和诗人应当和我们的朗诵队伍，建立起密切的联系和合作。朗诵者是诗人作家和群众联系的桥梁之一；通过他使作品更广泛的深入群众，通过他使文字变成声音，通过他使不识字的群众和工作繁忙无暇读书的人读到书。
    朗诵是一种较高级的艺术表现形式。因而朗诵者也需要有较高的水平，首先是充分领会作品的思想感情，这就需要一番艰苦的劳动。其次是较强的艺术表现能力。那天晚上，中央广播剧团同志们的朗诵，都表现出一定的成就。愿在祖国社会主义大跃进的高潮中，我们的朗诵大军壮大与成长，为广大的群众朗诵更多更好的诗篇。
