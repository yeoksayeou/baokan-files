Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 17th. A Burmese student friendship delegation visited the Yunnan Nationalities Institute on the 16th and celebrated the "Water-Splashing Festival" with the Dai students there.

　　At 9:30 in the morning, when the delegation arrived at the institute, students of all nationalities were dressed in festive costumes, singing and dancing to welcome them. The Shan and Kachin youths from Burma quickly made friends with the Dai and Jingpo students here, chatting cordially in the same language. The Burmese friends asked the president and students of the Nationalities Institute in detail about the school's organizational structure, development history, student learning and living conditions, and visited classrooms, libraries, dormitories, canteens, clinics, and bathrooms. In the library, the friends were very interested in the "Unity News," published in Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, and Han languages by the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan, and the "News," published in Dai language by the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan. Some Burmese friends read the news of the delegation's arrival in Mangshi from the "Unity News."

　　When the delegation arrived at the institute's Buddhist hall, students who believed in Buddhism greeted them with their palms together and worshiped the Buddha together. They also carefully perused various scriptures. In the Christian church, members of the delegation who believed in Christianity also piously recited "Hymns" with Christian students from the Lisu ethnic group.

　　These days mark the "Water-Splashing Festival" for the Dai people in Yunnan. In the sunny campus, the Dai students had been waiting for a long time with clear water. As soon as the Burmese friends walked over, the garden suddenly became lively, and everyone splashed water on each other to offer blessings. Laughter and the sound of "elephant-foot drums" resounded as one, and the youths of the two countries danced gracefully, jointly celebrating the festival.

　　Wu Larei, the head of the delegation, spoke warmly to the students of the Nationalities Institute, saying: "When we were still in Yangon, Prime Minister U Nu told us that we should go to the Yunnan Nationalities Institute to have a look. Today, we are very happy to see that all ethnic groups in Yunnan are making progress. You celebrate the "Water-Splashing Festival" with us according to ethnic customs, which makes us feel like we are at home. We have seen dances here that we often see in Burma, and heard songs that we often hear in Burma, which shows how profound the traditional friendship between the peoples of our two countries is!"

    云南民族学院宾至如归
    缅甸学生  傣族学生同度泼水节
    据新华社昆明17日电　缅甸学生友好访问团16日访问了云南民族学院，并且和这里的傣族学生一道欢度了“泼水节”。
    上午九点半钟，当访问团到达学院的时候，各民族学生都穿着节日盛装，载歌载舞地迎接他们。缅甸的掸族、克钦族青年很快就和这里的傣族、景颇族学生交上了朋友，他们用同一种语言亲切地交谈着。缅甸朋友们向民族学院的院长和学生仔细了解了学校的组织机构、发展历史，学生的学习和生活等各方面情况，并参观了教室、图书馆、宿舍、食堂、医务所和浴室等。在图书馆里，朋友们对云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州用傣、景颇、傈僳、汉等四种文字出版的“团结报”和云南西双版纳傣族自治州用傣文出版的“消息报”很感兴趣。有的缅甸朋友，从“团结报”上读到了访问团到达芒市的新闻。
    访问团来到学院佛堂时，信仰佛教的学生都合掌迎接他们，并一起拜了佛，他们还仔细翻阅了各种经书。在基督教堂里，信奉基督教的团员也和傈僳族学生中的基督教徒一起虔诚地朗诵了“赞美诗”。
    这几天，正值云南傣族人民过“泼水节”。在春光明媚的校园里，傣族学生提着清水等了很久，当缅甸朋友们刚走过来时，园子里顿时活跃起来，大家互相泼水祝福。欢笑声、“象脚鼓”声，响成一片，两国青年翩翩起舞，共同欢度佳节。
    访问团团长吴拉瑞热情地向民族学院的学生们讲了话，他说：“我们还在仰光的时候，吴努总理就叫我们应该到云南民族学院去看看。今天，看到了云南各民族都在进步，使我们非常高兴。你们按民族习惯和我们一起过“泼水节”，使我们就像在自己家里一样。我们在这里看到了在缅甸经常看见的舞蹈，听到了在缅甸经常听到的歌声，这就可以想见到我们两国人民有多么深远的传统友谊！”
