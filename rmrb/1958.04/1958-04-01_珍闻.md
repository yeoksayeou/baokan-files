	Large Sharks
	Around the "Qingming" Festival, it is the peak season for sharks off the coast of Zhejiang Province. This spring came early, and the weather is getting warmer, so sharks appeared in the waters of Wenzhou more than twenty days earlier than last year. On March 4th, members of the Huaping Fishery Cooperative in Yuhuan County caught a pair of large sharks in the Beiji fishing ground. The male weighed more than 7,000 jin, and the female weighed more than 6,000 jin. By mid-March, fishermen in Dongtou, Yuhuan, and other counties had successively caught eleven more large sharks. Currently, more than 50,000 fishermen in the Wenzhou area have set sail and are preparing to welcome the arrival of the shark schools. (Xia Fuqing)
	A Head of Garlic Weighing Twelve Liang
	The 500 mu of garlic planted by the First and Second Agricultural Cooperatives in Shuikeng, Gaoyao County, Guangdong, have yielded a bumper harvest this year. The total output reached more than 1 million jin, with an average yield of 2,000 jin per mu, an increase of about 200 jin per mu compared to last year. Some high-yield fields reached 2,600 jin per mu. A farmer in the Shantou Team of the Second Cooperative in Shuikeng harvested seventy or eighty jin of garlic, each head weighing more than twelve liang. According to some experienced farmers, although this year's garlic production has increased, the potential is still great. If field management can be strengthened and fertilizer applied once or twice more, the yield per mu can still reach 3,000 to 4,000 jin.

    大鲨鱼
    “清明”前后，是浙江省沿海鲨鱼旺汛季节。今年春早，气候日趋暖和，鲨鱼比去年提前二十多天在温州洋面露踪迹。3月4日玉环县花坪渔业社社员在北麂渔场捕获一对大鲨鱼，雄的一条体重七千多斤，雌的一条体重六千多斤。到3月中旬止，洞头，玉环等县渔民又相继捕获了十一条大鲨鱼。目前温州专区五万多渔民已扬帆出海，作好准备，等待鲨鱼群来临。（夏福卿）
    一头大蒜十二两
    广东高要县水坑第一、二农业社今年种植的五百亩大蒜获得丰收。总产量达一百多万斤，平均每亩产量为二千斤，比去年每亩增产约二百斤，有些高产的每亩达二千六百斤。水坑第二社山田队有一个农民收获的七、八十斤大蒜，个个重达十二两以上。据有些老农谈，今年的大蒜虽然增产，但潜力仍然很大，如能加强田间管理和增施一、二次肥料，每亩产量还可以达到三千斤至四千斤。
