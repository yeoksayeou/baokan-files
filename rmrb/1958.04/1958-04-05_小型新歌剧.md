Small new operas are an art form that the broad masses love to see and hear. In the Great Leap Forward, the Central Experimental Opera Troupe changed its past tendency of only producing large-scale operas and neglecting the rehearsal of small-scale operas. It adopted the approach of everyone pitching in. In just over ten days, it has created and performed more than ten small new operas reflecting real life, such as "Golden Phoenix Tree Blossoms," "Ferrying in Wind and Snow," "Lost Calf in the Middle of the Night," "Mending Shoes," and "Preparing the Dowry." These plays have been performed successively in workers' clubs in various districts of Beijing, as well as in the Fuping mountain area, Baoding, Liangxiang, and other places, and are very popular with the masses.

    小型新歌剧
    小型新歌剧原是广大群众喜闻乐见的艺术形式。中央实验歌剧院在跃进中，改变了过去只搞大戏，忽视排练小戏的偏向，采取了大家动手的做法，在短短的十几天内，已经创作和演出了：“金凤树开花”、“风雪摆渡”、“半夜失牛犊”、“补皮鞋”、“办嫁妆”等十来个反映现实生活的小型新歌剧。这些剧目已先后在北京各区的工人俱乐部以及阜平山区、保定、良乡等处演出，很受群众欢迎。（黄山）
