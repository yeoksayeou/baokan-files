	Marching Towards the Fortress of Science
	The old cadre class of Hubei Medical College is an internal medicine training class specially for old cadres. Of the fifty-eight comrades studying here, twenty-two participated in the revolution before 1943, and some even participated in the Long March. In 1955, they began to march towards the fortress of science. At that time, many of them only had a primary school education, and some had never been to school at all. After three years of arduous study, the students finally overcame the difficulties. For example, Liu Minggao only studied for two years and couldn't take notes at first. He couldn't understand the inverted sentences in the reference books, and he didn't recognize the chemical symbols. But after he thought of various methods, he finally kept up with the class. The students studied more than thirty courses in internal medicine, surgery, pharmacology, anatomy, etc., in three years, and also reviewed Latin. Many people's grades exceeded those of undergraduate students.
	The students have been able to play a backbone role in every political movement. Last year, when the Rightists rampantly attacked the Party, demanding that the Party withdraw from the school, they posted big-character posters suggesting strengthening the Party's leadership; when the Rightists wanted to engage in great democracy, they proposed that rectification should be carried out with gentle breezes and fine rain. Not a single Rightist element was found in their entire class. They will soon be taking up their posts.

    向科学堡垒进军
    湖北医学院的老干部班是专为老干部办的内科专修班，在这里学习的五十八位同志，有二十二人是1943年以前参加革命的，其中还有参加过长征的老同志。1955年，他们开始向科学堡垒进军。当时，他们中许多人只有小学程度，有的人根本没有念过书。三年来学员们经过顽强刻苦的学习终于克服了困难。如刘明高只学过两年文化，开始记不下笔记，参考书上的倒装句子看不顺眼，化学名词符号也不认得。但是经过他想了各种办法，终于跟上了班。学员们三年学了内科、外科、药理、解剖等方面的三十几门功课，还补习了拉丁文。许多人的成绩超过了本科学生。
    学员们在每次政治运动中，都能起骨干作用。去年，右派猖狂向党进攻时，要党退出学校，他们就贴大字报建议加强党的领导；右派要搞大民主，他们就提出整风要和风细雨。他们全班没有一个右派分子。最近他们将走上工作岗位。
