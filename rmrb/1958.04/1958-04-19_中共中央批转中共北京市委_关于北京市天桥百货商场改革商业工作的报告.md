To Shanghai Bureau, all Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, and all Autonomous Region Party Committees:

The report of the Beijing Municipal Committee on the reform of commercial work in the Tianqiao Department Store in Beijing is excellent. We are now forwarding it to you.

The main experience of the Tianqiao Department Store in Beijing is: focusing on political and ideological work, earnestly carrying out rectification, and resolutely following the mass line. On the basis of raising the socialist consciousness of employees, they rely on them to carry out relatively systematic innovations. All localities should seize this experience and launch rectification work in the commercial sector.

Central Committee:

Recently, the Tianqiao Department Store in Beijing has reformed its commercial work: the number of employees has been greatly streamlined, the political consciousness and labor efficiency of shop assistants have been greatly improved, service attitudes have been greatly improved, and waste has been greatly reduced. These are some fundamental reform measures proposed in response to the current backward state of commercial work. The experience of the past few months has proved that their reform measures are practical and feasible. The reform situation of this shopping mall is now reported as follows:

I. The main contents of the store's improvement work:

　　(1) The labor organization was reformed, and the number of employees was streamlined, reducing 46 people from the original 101, a reduction of 45%. After the reduction of personnel, not only was the work not affected, but because of dedicated responsibilities, labor enthusiasm and sense of responsibility were improved, and the work was done better than before.

　　(2) The past two-shift work system was changed to a "one-shift to the end" system, that is, without changing shifts from morning to night. Because there are sometimes many customers and sometimes few, eating and rest times can be adjusted according to the business's busyness. In this way, the actual working time per person per day generally will not exceed eight hours (some only five or six hours). In the past, some old shop assistants with higher political consciousness in the store did not approve of the eight-hour work system. First of all, they felt that there were many kinds of retail goods. With two shifts a day, the handover procedures back and forth made it difficult to distinguish responsibilities when mistakes occurred. At the same time, they also disapproved of the phenomenon of too many people and too little work and lax work. They believed that this was a waste of manpower. Commercial work was not continuous and intense labor, and could not be compared with the intense eight-hour labor of industry and agriculture. Now, changing to "one shift to the end" not only eliminates shift changes during the day and the need to count goods but also allows several salespersons to form a group to be jointly responsible. There is also no need to take stock every day. Except for a few extremely valuable goods, generally, only one inventory per month is required. This can greatly reduce the number of salespersons and enable them to do their work better.

　　(3) Compress inventory. The sales group directly purchases goods, purchases goods frequently, and sells goods quickly. This can greatly reduce working capital and save expenses. This shopping mall has more than 6,000 kinds of goods, which in the past were only controlled by two section chiefs. Some old shop assistants thought this method was not good. They criticized the section chiefs: "You only know how to stamp bureaucratic seals. If you can't get through them, you hand the stamps to others to stamp. In reality, there is no way to manage. Adding two more section chiefs will not solve the problem, but if you can't manage it, you are not willing to let us manage it." They believed that the sales group should be responsible for planning and deciding on purchases. Purchase whatever goods are needed. This will neither tie up funds nor cause shortages. They said that in the past, doing business emphasized frequently turning over capital, and one set of capital was enough, but now two sets of capital are used to do one set of business. This is truly "rich and powerful." Under the suggestion of the old shop assistants, after the system reform, unreasonable inventory was reduced. Reserve inventory was placed in the wholesale station, and the sales group directly contacted the wholesale station for purchasing under unified management. Now, working capital has been reduced from the original 320,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan, a reduction of 37%. It is estimated that 30,000 yuan can be saved in 1958, a decrease of 25% compared with 1957.

　　(4) Improve service attitude. In the past, shop assistants thought that being a salesperson was a "lowly" job with "humiliating work", and their service attitude was not good. They often argued with customers. Although the store also formulated a service convention during the rectification, most shop assistants were unwilling to comply with it. They believed that in a buy-and-sell transaction, customers could buy if they wanted to, and leave if they didn't. At the same time, the store was a state-owned enterprise, and losses had nothing to do with them. Therefore, establishing a convention was ineffective. After discussion, everyone understood that the relationship between salespersons and customers belonged to the relationship among the people. Improving service attitude was also a better way to serve the people and serve socialist construction. Now, the relationship between salespersons and customers is harmonious. As soon as people enter the shopping mall, salespersons greet them kindly, making people feel happy. There are many opinions praising the shop assistants, and the atmosphere in the shopping mall has been renewed.

II. The progress of this shopping mall's work is mainly due to the focus on political and ideological work and the relatively good rectification.

　　(1) This shopping mall began to improve the relationship between the Party and the masses and strengthen political and ideological work with the rectification campaign. Their rectification work was done relatively well, and the long-term problems that shop assistants and the masses were dissatisfied with were resolved in a timely manner, improving the relationship between the Party and the masses, and between cadres and the masses. This made the masses feel that they and the cadres were in an equal position, and everyone was responsible for the quality of the work, thus truly promoting the enthusiasm of the masses to be masters of their own affairs. During the rectification and airing of views, shop assistants and the masses raised many opinions on the large number of management personnel. The leadership reduced the management section from 51 people to 19 people, and delegated 32 people. The counter wood was not good and often pricked hands. Shop assistants and the masses had long requested repairs, and they had raised opinions countless times without any resolution. This time, the opinion was raised on the first day, and it was repaired and painted on the second day. At the same time, leading cadres accepted the opinions of the masses, put down their airs, and stopped being "hands-off shopkeepers." They participated in sales work, and the delegated cadres were also sent to the sales group to be shop assistants, thus becoming one with the masses. As a result, the store's leading cadres, because they directly participated in commercial service labor, were actually engaging in commercial "experimental fields." They not only directly gained business experience but also greatly encouraged and educated the shop assistants, deeply moving them. In the past, the masses dared not even speak to the manager. Now, seeing that the leadership was solving problems in a timely manner, they felt that they were also their own people, not aloof officials. Therefore, they dared to actively offer opinions. They also believed that since the employees had raised opinions and the leadership could correct them, why couldn't they correct their own shortcomings? Improving work was everyone's responsibility and should not solely rely on the leadership. In this way, the relationship between the leadership and the led was indeed changed, greatly improving the sense of ownership and responsibility of the masses. From the manager to every salesperson, everyone took responsibility and took action to improve work, twisting together into one rope.

　　(2) The key to commercial reform work is to strengthen political and ideological work. Now, managers, section chiefs, and group leaders are all focusing on political work. In the past, not only did the manager not care about political work, but the section chiefs (the main person in charge of the shopping mall) and group leaders also did not care. They all thought that doing commercial work was simply managing business, and political work was only entrusted to a few personnel cadres to manage. When problems arose among the masses, the personnel cadres would find them for talks. They would not be contacted if there were no problems. Contact usually meant being criticized. Therefore, the masses were frightened when they heard that they were being called for talks. The method of dealing with backward employees was either to criticize them harshly or simply transfer them. They were transferred east and west, but the reasons for their backwardness were neither sought nor specific solutions were studied. Because the leading cadres did not approach the masses, they did not understand the employees' political and ideological situation at all. Their views of the employees were also fixed. The advanced were always advanced, and the backward were always backward. As a result, the employees were alienated from the cadres, and they were unwilling to speak their minds. Old shop assistants felt that they were not valued, so they did not speak up.

Now, the leading cadres of this shopping mall have strengthened political and ideological work. They have formed a core group of Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres, who separately contact the masses and promote work. They directly participate in sales, connecting with the masses in labor. They concretely combine business and politics, relying on activists and old shop assistants familiar with the business as the pillars for carrying out political and ideological work, improving business, and improving labor organization. They have also carried out relatively in-depth work on backward masses, valuing their opinions and consulting with them on everything. They no longer adopt the method of simply transferring work and have launched a movement among the masses to compare with the advanced and catch up with the advanced, so that they supervise and promote each other. This has gradually transformed the backward into the advanced.

The cadres of this shopping mall have summarized their work into four items after improving their work: First, grasp several work indicators: 1. Sales volume; 2. Commercial management expenses; 3. Capital turnover; 4. Profit; 5. Whether there are errors in sales. Second, sign purchase contracts for certain state-allocated materials. Third, carry out political and ideological work. Fourth, transform capitalists and small business owners working in this shopping mall. It can be said that they have already figured out a set of methods for leading commercial work and combining politics and business.

III. The Tianqiao Department Store's reform of commercial work has greatly stimulated and promoted all commercial enterprises in Beijing. It has become a clarion call for promoting commercial reform, prompting all stores to make progress. Their slogan is: "Labor intensity like miners, service attitude like Tianqiao." The Beijing Department Store has actively launched discussions and is preparing to reduce 700 people from 1,400, a reduction of 50%, and compress inventory by 7.5 million yuan, a compression of 50%. Some stores are also preparing to propose more advanced indicators than the Tianqiao Department Store. The revolutionary enthusiasm of workers and peasants is driving shop assistants forward. Now, the revolutionary initiative of shop assistants has become a driving force for promoting high tides in industrial production. Comparing with the advanced, comparing with enthusiasm, and everything for socialism has become a combat mobilization slogan for all aspects of industry, agriculture, and commerce.

IV. Reforms such as those at the Tianqiao Shopping Mall have been realized in the high tide of the rectification campaign and the great socialist leap forward in industry and agriculture. After implementing the large-scale streamlining of personnel and the "one-shift to the end" system, the spirit of the staff is happy, but the labor is intense and the labor intensity is very high. Without further specific measures, it will be difficult to sustain. At present, in addition to reforming the management of commerce, such as no longer taking stock every day, the first thing to do is to adjust the staff dormitory. The reason why the old commercial working hours could generally achieve "one shift to the end" was because the front counter was for business, and the back counter was for living. Therefore, in order to maintain the "one shift to the end" system and prevent commercial staff from being too tired, it is now necessary to move the staff to live near the store in order to solve the problems of rest and meals for the staff so that their actual working hours are not too long and their work is not too tiring. After some stores are merged or closed, the vacated houses can be used as staff dormitories, and it is not necessary to build many more houses. Even if a few more houses are built, it is still worthwhile when considering the overall picture. Second, it is also necessary to cherish the staff's time. There should not be too many meetings, and the meetings should not be too long. Meetings must be prepared. The length of business hours also needs to be adjusted according to the busy and slack business conditions of different industries and regions. Do not extend business hours unnecessarily. For staff who are not in good health and for female staff with children who need to breastfeed and take care of household chores, care must also be taken. In short, while maintaining the enthusiasm of the staff, their health must also be taken into account. These things can all be discussed by the staff themselves to formulate some appropriate methods.

V. In order to thoroughly rectify the commercial enterprises in Beijing, we are prepared to:

　　(1) Vigorously streamline commercial personnel. The excessive number of commercial personnel is indeed a serious problem. Comparing the city's population with the number of commercial employees, an average of three out of every hundred people are engaged in commercial activities. If their families are added, calculated at an average of 4.5 people per household, an average of fourteen out of every hundred people are commercial people. So many commercial personnel who are not engaged in direct production are obviously a huge waste and are very detrimental to socialist accumulation. We are prepared to allocate the streamlined commercial personnel to rural production, form afforestation teams to participate in mountain greening work, participate in handicrafts cooperatives, or engage in other sideline occupations.

　　(2) The city's commercial network organization must be re-adjusted. At present, the distribution of commercial enterprises in Beijing is very uneven and unreasonable. In some places, there are often several stores selling the same kind of goods in a row, while in some places there are none. This needs to be planned as a whole. Some retail stores that sell the same kind of goods and are placed too densely should be closed down. Oil, salt, and sundry goods stores should be distributed more evenly and more densely. Small department stores should also be distributed more evenly. In short, appropriate adjustments should be made according to the distribution of residents, based on the principle of facilitating the masses, that is, facilitating customers.

　　(3) Change the leadership relationship, and retail stores will be led by the district. One district or two districts will operate a wholesale store with several warehouses under it, and retail stores will no longer set up warehouses.

Please indicate whether the above opinions are appropriate.

    中共中央批转中共北京市委
    关于北京市天桥百货商场改革商业工作的报告上海局，各省、市委，各自治区党委：
    北京市委关于北京市天桥百货商场改革商业工作的报告很好，现在把它转给你们。
    北京市天桥百货商场的主要经验是：抓紧政治思想工作，认真搞好整改，坚决走群众路线，在提高职工的社会主义觉悟的基础上，依靠他们进行比较系统的革新。各地应抓住这个经验，在商业部门中展开整改的工作。
                                           中　央				　一九五八年四月二日中央：
    最近，北京市天桥百货商场对于商业工作进行了改革：从业人员大加精简，店员的政治觉悟和劳动效率大大提高，服务态度大有改进，浪费现象大为减少。这些都是针对着目前商业工作的落后状态而提出来的一些根本性质的改革措施，几个月来的经验证明，他们的改革措施是切实可行的。现在把这个商场的改革情况报告如下：
    一、这个商场改进工作的几项主要内容：
    （1）改革了劳动组织，精简了从业人员，从原来的一百零一人中减去了四十六人，即减少了45％。人员减少以后，不但工作没有受影响，因为事有专责，劳动积极性和责任心提高，工作反而比从前做得好了。
    （2）从过去的两班工作制改为“一班顶到底”，即从早到晚不换班。因为顾客有时多，有时少，可以按照营业的忙闲，调整吃饭和休息时间，这样，每人每日实际做工作的时间一般不会超过八小时（有的不过五、六小时）。过去该店有些政治觉悟较高的老店员对于八小时工作制是不赞成的，首先是觉得零售商品种类很多，一天实行两班制，中间交接手续倒来倒去，出了错责任不易分清，同时对于人多事少，工作懈怠的现象他们也看不顺眼，他们认为这是浪费人力，商业工作并不是连续的紧张的劳动，和工、农业的八小时紧张劳动不能相比。现在改为“一班顶到底”，不但日间不换班，货物不须交点，同时几个售货员一组，共同负责，也不需要每天盘货，除少数极贵重的货以外，一般地只要一月清点一次就可以了。这样就可以把售货员大大减少，并且使售货员的工作做得更好。
    （3）压缩库存，由售货小组直接进货，勤进货，快销货，这样可以大大减少流动资金，节省开支。这个商场有六千多种商品，过去只靠两个股长来掌握，有些老店员认为这个办法不好，他们批评股长：“你们只会盖官僚章，盖不过来就把图章交给别人盖，实际上没法管，再添两个股长也解决不了问题，可是你们管不了，又不放心让我们管。”他们认为应该由售货组负责筹划和决定进货，需要什么货就进什么货，既不会积压资金，也不会引起脱销。他们说过去做生意讲究勤倒资金，有一套资金就足够了，现在却是两套资金作一套生意，这真是“财大气粗”。在老店员的建议下，制度改革以后，不合理的库存压缩下去了，储备库存放在批发站，由售货组在统一管理下直接去联系进货。现在，流动资金已从原来的三十二万元减为二十万元，即减少了37％；1958年预计可以节省开支三万元，比1957年减少25％。
    （4）改善服务态度。过去，店员们认为当售货员是“低三下四”的工作，服务态度不好，同顾客时常吵嘴，虽然该店在整改中也订了服务公约，但是店员多半不愿遵守，认为一买一卖，顾客爱买就买，不爱买就走，同时，商店又是国家企业，赔钱和自己无关系，因此，订立公约也无效。经过辩论以后，大家才明白售货员同顾客之间的关系属于人民内部的关系，改善服务态度，也就是更好的为人民服务，为社会主义建设服务。现在，售货员同顾客之间的关系融洽了，人们一进商场，售货员就和蔼地招呼，使人感到愉快，表扬店员的意见很多，商场气象一新。
    二、这个商场工作的进步，主要是因为抓紧了政治思想工作，并且整改得比较好。
    （1）这个商场改善党和群众的关系、加强政治思想工作，是从整风开始的。他们的整改工作做得比较好，把过去店员群众长期不满意的问题及时解决了，改善了党群关系、干群关系，使群众感觉到自己和干部是处于平等的地位，工作好坏大家都有责任，因而真正发扬了群众的当家作主的积极性。整改鸣放的时候，店员群众对管理人员太多，提了很多意见，领导上就把管理股从五十一人减少到十九人，下放了三十二人。柜台木料不好，经常扎手，店员群众早就要求修理，提了不知多少次意见也没有解决，这一次头天提出意见，第二天就修好了，还上了漆。同时领导干部又接受了群众意见，放下架子，不再当“甩手掌柜的”，参加了售货工作，下放干部也放到售货小组去当店员，因而就与群众打成一片。这样作的结果，商店领导干部，因为直接参加商业服务劳动，实际上是搞了商业上的“试验田”，不但直接取得了营业经验；同时对售货员也是个很大的鼓舞和教育，使他们深受感动。群众过去见了经理连话都不敢说，现在看见领导上及时解决问题，感觉到也是自己人，不是高高在上的老爷，因而敢于积极提意见了。他们又认为既然职工提了意见，领导上能够改正，为什么自己有了缺点不能改正呢？改进工作是大家的责任，不能单纯依靠领导。这样，就确实改变了领导同被领导之间的关系，大大提高了群众的主人翁感和责任心，从经理一直到每一个售货员，大家一齐负责动手改进工作，上下扭成一股劲了。
    （2）商业改革工作的关键是加强政治思想工作，现在，从经理、股长、小组长都抓紧了政治工作。过去不但经理不管政治工作，股长（该商场主要负责人）、小组长也不管，他们都认为搞商业工作就是单纯管业务，把政治工作只是交给几个人事干部来管理，群众发生了什么问题，人事干部就找去谈话，没有事不找，一找大概就是挨整，因此，一听到叫去谈话群众就吓一跳。对待落后职工的办法，不是生硬地批评就是简单地调走，东调西调，究竟为什么落后，既不寻找原因，也不设法研究具体解决。由于领导干部不接近群众，对职工的政治思想情况根本不摸底，对职工的看法也是一成不变，先进的永远先进，落后的永远落后。结果，职工同干部隔阂，心里的话不愿意说。老店员因感到不受重视，有话也不说。
    现在，这个商场的领导干部已经加强了政治思想工作，他们把党、政、工、团干部组成核心小组，分头联系群众，推动工作。直接参加售货，在劳动中同群众连成一片。把业务和政治具体结合起来，依靠积极分子，依靠熟悉业务的老店员，作为进行政治思想工作、改进业务、改善劳动组织的支柱。对于落后群众也进行了比较深入的工作，重视他们的意见，凡事同他们商量，不再采取简单调动工作的办法，并且在群众中展开了比先进、赶先进的运动，使他们互相督促推动，这样就使落后的也逐渐变成先进的了。
    这个商场的干部在改进工作以后把他们的工作归纳为四项：第一，抓几个工作指标：1、销货额；2、商业管理费用；3、资金周转；4、利润；5、售货中有无差错。第二，对某些国家分配的物资签订进货合同。第三，进行政治思想工作。第四，对于在本商场工作的资本家和小业主进行改造。可以说，他们已经摸出一套领导商业工作、使政治与业务相互结合的方法。
    三、天桥百货商场改革商业工作后，对于北京所有商业都是一个很大的刺激和推动，已经成为促进商业工作改革的号角，促使所有商店都要进步，他们提出的口号是：“劳动强度比矿工，服务态度比天桥”。百货大楼已经积极展开讨论，准备从一千四百人中减少七百人，即减少50％，压缩库存七百五十万元，即压缩50％。有些商店还准备提出比天桥百货商场更为先进的指标。工人、农民的革命干劲，促使店员前进，现在店员的革命倡议又成为促使工业生产高涨的动力。比先进、比干劲，一切为着社会主义，已经成为工、农、商业各方面的战斗动员口号。
    四、天桥商场等这样的改革，是在整风和工农业社会主义大跃进的高潮中实现的。在实行了人员大精简和“一班顶到底”的制度后，工作人员的精神是愉快的，但是劳动是紧张的，劳动强度是很高的，如果没有进一步的具体措施，是难以持久的。目前除了改革商业的经营管理，如不再天天点货等以外，首先要调整店员宿舍。旧的商业的工作时间所以能够一般地做到“一班顶到底”，就是因为前柜营业，后柜住人。所以为了使“一班顶到底”的制度坚持下去，而又使商业工作人员不过分疲劳，现在就需要将店员搬到商店附近去住，以便解决店员的休息和吃饭等问题，使他们的实际工作时间，不至于过长，工作不至于过累。有些商店合并或者撤销以后，即可把腾出来的房子作为职工宿舍，并不需要增建很多房子，即便多少增建一点房子，算大帐也很合得来。其次，还要珍惜职工的时间，会议不要太多，时间不要太长，开会必须有准备；营业时间的长短也需要根据不同行业、不同地区、营业忙闲的情况加以调整，不要把营业时间不必要地延长，对于身体不好的职工，对于有小孩的女职工给小孩喂奶和照管家务，也要加以照顾。总之，既要保持职工的积极性，又要照顾到他们的健康，这些事情都可以由职工自己来议一议，订出一些妥善的办法。
    五、为了彻底地把北京市的商业加以整顿，我们准备：
    （1）大力精减商业人员。商业人员过多确是一个严重的问题，以全市人口同商业从业人员相比，平均每百人中即有三个人是从事商业的人员，如果加上他们的家属，平均以每户四点五口人计算，平均每百人中即有十四人是商业人口，这样多不从事直接生产的商业人员，显然是极大的浪费，对于社会主义积累是很不利的。我们准备将精简下来的商业人员，分配到农村生产，组成造林队去参加山区绿化工作，参加手工业合作社劳动，或者从事其他副业。
    （2）必须从新调整全市商业网组织。现在北京市的商业分布很不平衡，很不合理，有的地方经营同类商品的商店往往一连好几个，有些地方却又没有，需要通盘筹划一下。经营同类商品又摆得太密的零售店要撤销一些，油盐杂货店要分布得更均匀些，更密一些，小百货店也要分布得匀一些，总之要按照居民分布的情况，在便利群众即便利顾客的原则下来适当调整。
    （3）改变领导关系，零售店交区领导。一个区或者两个区搞一个批发店，下设几个仓库，零售店即不再设立仓库。
    以上意见妥否，请示。
