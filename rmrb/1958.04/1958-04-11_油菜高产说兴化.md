High Oilseed Rape Yields: Talking About Xinghua
Liu Dingan, Director of the Seed Administration Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture

Last year, the average oilseed rape yield in Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, was 185.4 jin per mu, exceeding the national average yield by 368% and the average yield of Sichuan Province, which had the highest yield, by 178%, winning it the first place in the country for large-scale high yield. If we take Duotian Township, the concentrated oilseed rape production area of the county, it is the best of the best. Last year, the oilseed rape area in this township was 15,599 mu, with an average yield of 198 jin per mu; the Linggou Agricultural Cooperative in the township had 156 mu of oilseed rape, with a yield of 256 jin per mu. These figures are even higher than the national average.

From March 20th to 23rd, I and representatives from various provinces visited Xinghua County to see the growth of oilseed rape, and we were very excited and inspired. I believe that Xinghua County was able to achieve such high yields of oilseed rape under such difficult natural conditions, so there is no reason why oilseed rape cannot achieve high yields throughout the country. Therefore, I would like to make the following introduction.

Man Will Conquer Nature and Subdue Nature

Xinghua County is located in the Lixiahe area north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province. The water surface area of the county accounts for 40%. The oilseed rape producing areas are mostly in the western area with intricate river networks, forming a spider web-like pattern. The ground is no more than one meter above the water surface at the highest point during the dry season in winter, and only one or two chi at the lowest; most of it is flooded in summer. Because land and water are intertwined, there are no land routes, so farmers do not raise cattle or horses, and all farming operations rely on manpower. Farm tools are only shovels and hoes, without plows or harrows. There are no vehicles for transportation and no threshing grounds, only a small boat that serves as both a vehicle, a horse, and a threshing ground. It is conceivable how difficult agricultural production is under these conditions. However, the people of Xinghua County did not succumb to nature. They fought tenaciously with nature for a long time and finally created a miracle. On the one hand, they dug up soil from low-lying fields and raised them to form "duotian" (stacked fields); on the other hand, they dug shallow beaches into deep waterways for boats to travel. Now the townships in the western part of Xinghua County are all built with high duotian, more than three meters above the water surface. Each duotian is like a small hill. In times of drought, water can be scooped up to irrigate the fields, and in times of heavy rain, harvests can be guaranteed. Many of these townships grow oilseed rape (one township is called Duotian Township, where oilseed rape accounts for 46% of the cultivated land area). Every time after Qingming, when the oilseed rape flowers are in full bloom, the duotian stand in the water, and yellow flowers spread from the slopes to the tops of the fields, like flower balls. What a great miracle this is! The spirit of the people of Xinghua in conquering nature like the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains is infinitely admirable.

Masterful Skills in Planting Oilseed Rape

The high yield of oilseed rape in Xinghua County is not accidental. In addition to selecting cold-resistant and high-yielding varieties, the outstanding feature is the rich experience of local farmers in meticulous cultivation. Their oilseed rape cultivation is highly technical. The main experiences are:

I. In terms of seedling cultivation, because local autumn crops are harvested late and the temperature often drops to minus 10 to 14 or 15 degrees Celsius, they adopt the method of seedling cultivation and transplanting. This method not only allows the previous crops to fully mature and obtain high yields, but also allows the oilseed rape to be sown at the right time, fully develop, and cultivate strong seedlings to safely overwinter. Moreover, due to the different harvesting times of the previous crops, the sowing and transplanting times of oilseed rape are also different, so the cultivation and management methods are also different. They divide oilseed rape into two types: early and late, according to the sowing and transplanting times. Early oilseed rape is sown before the Autumn Equinox. Because the temperature is high at this time and pests easily occur, the seedbed is selected on a shady field surface, and water is poured every day after sowing to lower the temperature and supply the plants with the water they need for growth. Topdressing is also applied three times during the seedling stage to promote rapid seedling growth. Late oilseed rape is sown during the Cold Dew period. At this time, the temperature gradually decreases, and the seedbed is selected on a sunny field surface. Water is poured every two or three days after sowing, only to keep the soil moist. Topdressing is applied at most twice, and the amount is also less. The reason for this is that late rapeseed is transplanted late, and if there is too much water and fertilizer, the seedlings will grow fat and tender and will be easily damaged by frost, so a control method must be used to make the seedlings as old and strong as possible. As for careful soil preparation before sowing, seed selection and germination, and timely thinning (about ten days after sowing) after emergence, both early and late rapeseed are very serious and meticulous.

II. In terms of transplanting: Early oilseed rape is transplanted after the Frost's Descent and before the Beginning of Winter. Water is poured every day after transplanting until it survives (about four days). After that, water is no longer poured if the soil is not dry. The fields are also "baked" (sun-dried) twice to promote root development and healthy seedlings. Late oilseed rape is transplanted between the Beginning of Winter and the Winter Solstice. Before survival, only light watering is carried out to avoid excessive moisture. Afterwards, the fields are also baked two or three times to promote strong seedlings. Because early rapeseed is planted early, and has already rooted and sprouted before transplanting, it is able to defend against cold and frost, so it should be planted shallowly (about half an inch deep) so that the root system is close to the ground, can obtain high temperatures, and grow quickly. Late oilseed rape seedlings are easily frozen, so they should be planted deeply (about one inch to one and a half inches) to protect the safety of the seedlings. The old farmers' experience sums up: "Early rapeseed is planted at the root, late rapeseed is planted at the heart," which is very reasonable. When transplanting, they also have very valuable experience. First, they strictly adhere to the principle of "not planting overnight seedlings." The seedlings dug up on the same day must be planted on the same day, because overnight seedlings grow very slowly. Secondly, when they plant seedlings, people must face the sun, dig holes with a small knife, push the soil backwards, and transplant the seedlings so that they face the sun and have soil behind them as a barrier to prevent the northwest wind from blowing. This is also a very reasonable and valuable experience.

III. In terms of dense planting: Xinghua County generally has the habit of dense planting of oilseed rape. Early oilseed rape is planted with more than 20,000 to 25,000 plants per mu, with a plant spacing of four to five cun and a row spacing of five to six cun. Late oilseed rape is planted with more than 15,000 plants per mu, with a plant spacing of five cun and a row spacing of six to seven cun. Dense planting is an important factor for high oilseed rape yields, and it can also increase the seedlings' ability to resist cold in winter; if there is a lack of seedlings in spring, they can also be transplanted to supplement the seedlings.

After overwintering, sufficient fertilizer and water are applied to promote seedling growth and vigorous growth in the later stages. In early spring, a thick layer of river mud slurry is poured once to press the roots of the seedlings (because the soil is loose after thawing and the roots are pulled out), so that they can quickly turn green. After that, mud slurry is poured every ten days or so; but each time it is thinner than the last, for a total of four times, until the Qingming Festival. After Qingming until the flowering period, mud slurry is generally no longer poured. Their timing of applying mud slurry is very reasonable, and the effect is very obvious. The local saying goes: "One pouring presses the roots, two pourings sprout branches, three pourings make the flowers bloom to the top, and four pourings make the rapeseed like a fish's eye," which fully illustrates that they have grasped the growth law of oilseed rape.

In addition, if there is wind and sand blowing during the flowering period, they also wash it with clean water after the wind and sand, so that the flowers can return to normal. According to old farmers, if they are not washed, the flowers will close, like a person's eyes containing sand, unable to open smoothly, and the rapeseed will be reduced.

Finally, they harvest oilseed rape very carefully. Oilseed rape begins to be harvested at the Slight Full stage. At this time, the rapeseed matures very quickly. If the time is not seized to harvest, it will be easily lost. If it is wetted by rain, the quality of the rapeseed will deteriorate, and the oil content will be reduced. Therefore, they all line up in advance according to the seedlings and rush to harvest in a timely manner. The harvesting time is in the morning and evening when the air is humid, and it is stopped when the weather is sunny and dry in the afternoon. Harvesting is mostly done by hand, pulling up the roots, which will prolong the after-ripening effect of the rapeseed. The harvested plants are also dried in a criss-cross standing method, not a stacking method, because the sunlight is uneven on the upper and lower layers of stacking, and the lower layer is easily damp, heated, and moldy. Threshing is mostly done on the boat nearby, without much handling or random hitting. Therefore, the county's oilseed rape can not only ensure production but also ensure harvest.

As the saying goes, "Man respects the field by one point, and the field respects man by three points." After seeing such meticulous cultivation by the people of Xinghua County, one knows that their high yield of oilseed rape is inevitable.

Now, each township and cooperative is carrying out seedling inspection and alignment, to cultivate the first-class seedlings better, to catch up the second-class seedlings to the first-class seedlings, and to eliminate the third-class seedlings, and decided to complete all four topdressings before the Qingming Festival; individual strengthening of cultivation management is also being prepared for weak seedlings; enthusiastic competitions are also being carried out between townships and cooperatives.

    油菜高产说兴化
    农业部种子管理局局长　刘定安
    去年江苏兴化县的油菜每亩平均产籽一百八十五点四斤，高出全国平均产量368％，高出平均产量最高的四川省178％，赢得了全国大面积高产第一名。如果以该县油菜集中产区的垛田乡来说，那更是魁中之魁。去年这个乡油菜面积为一万五千五百九十九亩，每亩平均产籽一百九十八斤；该乡的凌沟农业社一百五十六亩油菜，每亩产籽为二百五十六斤。它们就高出全国更多。
    我和各省代表们在3月20日到23日参观了兴化县的油菜生长情况，感到十分兴奋，情绪激动。我觉得兴化县以那样困难的自然条件，油菜能得到那样高的产量，那么全国各地油菜不能得到高产是没有理由的，所以特作以下介绍。
    人定胜天，征服自然
    兴化县在江苏省长江北面里下河地区，全县水面面积占40％，油菜产区大部是在河港错综复杂、形成蛛网状的西部地区。地面离水面在冬季枯水位时最高不过一公尺，低的只一、二市尺；夏季大部为水所淹，因为水陆交叉，没有陆路，所以农民既不养牛，又不养马，耕田操作，全靠人力。农具也只有锹镢之类，没有犁耧。行路无车、打谷无场，惟凭一只小船，既当车又当马且当场。可以想见，在这样条件下进行农业生产有多么的困难。但是，兴化县人民却没有向自然屈服，他们长期和自然作了顽强的斗争，终于创造了奇迹。他们一面把低田掘土加高，垒成了垛田；一面把浅滩挖成了深水河道，以便行船。现在兴化县西部的乡，都筑成高高的垛田，高出水面三公尺以上，每块垛田好像一个小丘，天旱时可以戽水灌田，多水时也能保证收成。这些乡种油菜很多
  （一个乡叫垛田乡，油菜占耕地面积的46％），每当清明以后油菜花盛开，块块垛田亭立水中，从坡侧到田顶黄花招展，好似一个个花球，这是多么伟大的奇迹啊！兴化人民愚公移山的征服自然的精神，令人无限敬佩。
    匠心艺手栽油菜
    兴化县油菜所以能得到高产，并不是偶然的。除了选用耐寒高产的品种外，突出的是当地农民精细栽培的丰富经验。他们栽培油菜技术性很高。主要经验是：
    一、在育苗方面，由于当地秋季作物收获较晚，气温常降到摄氏零下十度到十四、五度，他们便采取育苗移栽的方法，这种方法既能使前期作物充分成熟，获得高产，又能使油菜适期播种，充分发育，培成壮苗，安全越冬。又由于前作物的收获先后不同，油菜的播种和移苗时期也不同，因而栽培管理的方法也不同。他们把油菜按播种和移栽的时期，分为早、晚两种。早油菜在秋分前播种。因为这时气温高，容易发生虫害，所以苗床就选用向阴田面，并且在播种后每天浇水以降低气温，供给植株生长所需的水分；在苗期还要追肥三次，促苗迅速生长。晚油菜则于寒露时播种。这时气温渐低，苗床就选用向阳田面。播种后每隔二、三天浇水一次，只保持土壤湿润。追肥最多二次，数量也较少。其所以如此，是因为晚菜移栽晚，如果水多肥多，幼苗长得肥嫩，容易遭受冻害，所以要用控制方法，使苗尽量老壮。至于播种前精细整地、选种催芽、出苗后要及时（播种十天左右）间苗等，则早菜晚菜都是很认真很细致的。
    二、在移栽方面：早油菜在霜降后立冬前移栽，移栽后每天浇水，直到成活为止（约四天）。以后土壤不干，就不再浇水。还要分两次烤田（日晒），以促进根系发育，幼苗健壮。晚油菜在立冬冬至之间移栽，未成活前，只行轻浇，避免水分过多。以后也要烤田两、三次，促使苗壮。由于早油菜种得早，移栽前已经稳根发棵，足能防御寒冻，所以要浅栽（深约半寸），使根系接近地面，能得高温，很快生长。晚油菜，幼苗容易受冻，所以栽得要深（约一寸至一寸半），以保护苗的安全。当地老农经验总结说：“早菜栽根，晚菜栽心”，是十分有道理的。在移栽的时候，他们也有很宝贵的经验。首先严格掌握“不栽隔夜苗”，当天起的苗，一定当天栽完，因为隔夜苗生长很缓慢。其次，他们栽苗的时候，人一定要面向太阳，用小刀掘穴，推土向后，移栽后使苗迎阳光，背后有土作屏障，防西北风吹袭。这也是十分合理的宝贵经验。
    三、在密植方面：兴化县油菜普遍有密植习惯，早油菜每亩栽二万到二万五千株以上，株距四——五寸，行距五——六寸。晚油菜每亩栽一万五千株以上，株距五寸，行距六——七寸。密植是油菜高产的重要因素，而且可以增加苗的冬季御寒能力；春季缺苗，还可移植补苗。
    在越冬以后，则充分施肥浇水，促进苗的生长和后期旺盛。在开春时厚浇河泥浆一次，压住苗根（因解冻后土松有根拔现象），使其很快返青。以后每隔十天左右浇泥浆一次；但一次比一次要稀薄一些，共浇四次，到清明节为止。清明以后到盛花期，一般就不再浇泥水了。他们的施泥浆的时期是很合理的，效果十分明显，当地有“一浇压根，二浇发杈，三浇花开花到顶，四浇菜籽像个鱼眼睛”四句话，充分说明他们是摸清了油菜的生长规律。
    此外在花期如果遇有风沙飞扬，他们还在风沙过后，用清水喷洗一次，使花恢复正常。据老农谈，如果不洗则花合闭，好像人的眼睛含有沙粒，不能畅开，菜籽就会减少。
    最后他们收获油菜也是十分细致的。油菜在小满时开始收获。此时菜籽成熟极快，如果不抓紧时间收获，就容易受到损失，若被雨淋湿，菜籽品质变坏，含油量就会减少。因此，他们都事先按苗排队，及时抢收。收获时间在早晚空气湿润时，上下午天晴干燥便停止。收获多用手连根拔起，这会延长油菜籽的后熟作用。收获后的植株又采用交叉立晒法，不用堆积法，因堆晒上下受日光不均匀，下层容易受潮发热霉烂。脱粒多就近在船上，不多搬运，也不乱打。所以该县油菜不但能保产，而且保收。
    俗话说“人敬田一分，田敬人三分”，看了兴化县人民的这样精细的栽培，便知他们获得油菜高产是理有必然了。
    现在，各乡各社正开展查苗排队，要把一类苗培植的更好，二类苗赶上一类苗，消灭掉三类苗，并决定在清明节以前全部追完四次肥；对弱小的苗还准备个别加强培植管理；乡与乡、社与社间也开展了热烈的竞赛。
