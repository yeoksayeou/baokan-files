Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 24th: For more than a month, the first batch of returning Chinese People's Volunteers have been warmly welcomed by the people of Korea along their journey home.

Since the first batch of the Chinese People's Volunteers began to withdraw from Korea, from towns to villages, from the 38th parallel to the Yalu River, both sides of the roads and at train stations where the returning Volunteers passed were crowded with cheering people holding colorful flags and flowers. With a feeling of reluctance, they cheered and sang with the Volunteers. When a Volunteer unit in a certain area set out from their station to the train station at night, the local Korean people who came to see them off held torches high, like a long fiery dragon winding along the winding mountain road. Old women and girls danced as they walked, leading the way in front of the column until dawn. For more than a month, regardless of day or night, an average of more than four thousand citizens of Wonsan gathered at the train station every day to see off the trains carrying the returning Volunteers, heading towards the distance. Many Korean mothers, some with jars of honey and gift packages on their heads, crossed mountains and ridges to catch up with the Volunteer trains, to visit and say goodbye, and some waited at the station to put hand-made rice cakes into the pockets of the Volunteer soldiers. A Korean mother in her fifties, Shen Lishu, said to the Volunteer soldiers: "You came to Korea for justice and helped us defeat the American invaders. Now that you are returning home, people can be separated, but our hearts can never be divided." (Attached picture)

	In Hwanghae-bukto Province, Jangpung County, Korea, Lee Jeong-ro was bitten by a poisonous snake while working in the field. Xue Yueqing, deputy company commander, and Cao Jinduo, of the Volunteer tank unit, rushed him to the hospital for treatment, which saved him from danger. When the Volunteer tank unit withdrew from Korea, Lee Jeong-ro and his wife and sister-in-law rushed to the Volunteers' station to say goodbye. This is Lee Jeong-ro's wife giving a sachet to Cao Jinduo.

    人能分开　心分不开
    朝鲜各地人民依依惜别志愿军
    据新华社平壤24日电　一个多月来，中国人民志愿军首批归国部队在归国途中，受到朝鲜各地人民的热烈欢送。
    从志愿军首批归国部队开始撤出朝鲜以来，从城镇到乡村，从“三八线”到鸭绿江，凡在志愿军归国部队通过的公路两旁和车站上，白天晚上都拥集着手执彩旗和花朵的欢送人群。他们怀着惜别的心情，和志愿军官兵一起欢呼、歌唱。某地的志愿军部队晚上从驻地向车站进发时，前来欢送的当地朝鲜人民高举火炬，好像一条长长的火龙蜿蜒在曲折的山路旁；老大娘和姑娘们，边走边舞，在队伍前头引路，一直送到天明。一个多月来，元山市民不管白天或黑夜，平均每天都有四千多群众聚集在车站上，欢送一列列载着志愿军归国部队的列车，驶向远方。许多朝鲜妈妈，有的头上顶着蜂蜜罐和礼物包，翻山越岭地赶上志愿军列车，探望送别，有的守候在车站上，把亲手做好的米糕，装进志愿军战士们的衣袋里。一位五十多岁的朝鲜妈妈申礼淑对志愿军战士说：“你们为了正义，来到朝鲜，帮助我们打败了美国强盗。现在，你们回国了，人能分开，我们的心永远也分不开。”（附图片）
