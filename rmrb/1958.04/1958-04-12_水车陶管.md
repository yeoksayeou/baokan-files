    Water Wheel Ceramic Pipes
    The Dingfeng Pottery Factory in Zibo City, Shandong Province, successfully trial-produced ceramic pipes for water wheels in March, and field tests have proven that the results are good. The factory will produce 100,000 sets in the first half of the year to meet the needs of farmland water conservancy construction.
    The advantages of this water wheel pipe are: acid and alkali resistant, rust-free, and most suitable for saline land. As long as it is protected from breakage, it can be used for a long time. The price is cheap, about 20% lower per set than plain galvanized iron pipes. The inside of the pipe is smooth, which can reduce the pulling force of the water, and it can be used in wells more than two zhang deep. At present, there is a relative shortage of raw materials for manufacturing iron water pipes, and the production of this ceramic pipe is of great significance for supporting farmland water conservancy construction and solving the difficulty of raw material supply.

    水车陶管
    山东省淄博市鼎丰窑厂于3月份试制成水车用的陶管，经过实地试验证明，效果良好。这个厂上半年将生产出十万套，以供应农田水利建设的需要。
    这种水车管的优点是：耐酸、耐碱、不生锈，最适用于咸水地，只要避免碰破，可以长期使用，价钱便宜，每套比平白铁管低20％左右；管内光滑，用水拉力可以减轻，在两丈以上深的水井内都可使用。当前制造铁质水管原料较为缺乏，制成这种陶管对支援农田水利建设及解决原材料的供应困难有重大作用。
