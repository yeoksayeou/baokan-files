Self-Reliance Unearths "Local Experts"
Jiangxi Establishes Over 5,000 Factories in One Month

(Our newspaper's Nanchang dispatch on April 29th) After Jiangxi Province used local methods with self-reliance to overcome the difficulties of insufficient technology, equipment, and technical personnel, it established more than 5,000 factories in the past month, an average of about 170 factories completed each day. The vast majority of these factories that have already been put into production serve agricultural production, including farm tool repair and manufacturing, fertilizer, and feed factories. Since the newly built factories mostly utilize existing vacant houses or sheds, some factories can start production after only a few days of preparation.

Having money but not being able to buy machinery and equipment, and a lack of technical personnel, were the biggest difficulties Jiangxi Province encountered in developing local industry. However, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Party committees at all levels mobilized the masses to come up with ingenious ideas and local methods, helping the newly built factories eliminate the difficulties one by one. They used methods such as technology returning to the ranks, old factories providing assistance, master craftsmen teaching apprentices, organizing visits and learning, running crash training courses, and visiting and paying respects to talented people to find a large number of "local experts" and "local engineers." The Fuzhou Special District has found nearly two thousand "local engineers" using the above methods. Yushan County adopted a technical registration method, and at one time found dozens of mechanical and electrical, fertilizer, and surveying technicians from cadres and demobilized soldiers. Many old factories in Shangrao, Ji'an, and other places also made guarantees of "training technicians on behalf, accepting all comers, and guaranteeing to teach," to quickly cultivate technical forces for the newly built factories. In addition, each county also sent personnel in batches to "learn from experience" inside and outside the province, to study technical knowledge.

The local methods for solving the problem of insufficient technical equipment are also diverse. In addition to purchasing some more complex machinery and equipment from other places, general equipment is mostly solved by drawing from existing old factories and mobilizing various machinery factories to trial-produce. The Shangrao Special District plans to greatly expand feed processing plants this year. Unable to buy machines, the Shangrao Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized and organized workers at the Shangrao Farm Tool Factory to successfully trial-produce a "universal pulverizer," which is now being produced in large quantities, fully guaranteeing the needs of factory construction throughout the district. Another method is to implement "local mechanization." For example, the newly built winery in Xiajiang County originally planned to use machines for production, but could not buy steam steel pipes; later, the masses tried every means to change to a new local method, using locally produced thatch bamboo instead of steel pipes for steaming water, which saved money, and the efficiency and product quality were not affected at all.

    自力更生挖掘“土专家”
    江西一月办厂五千多
    本报南昌29日电　江西省自力更生用土办法克服技术设备和技术人员不足的困难以后，在最近1月内办起五千多个工厂，平均每天约有一百七十个工厂建成。这些已投入生产的工厂，绝大部分都是为农业生产服务的，有农具修造、肥料、饲料等工厂。由于新建厂大都利用旧有的空闲房屋或茅棚，因此有些厂只经过几天筹备就能开工生产。
    有钱买不到机器设备，缺乏技术人员，这是江西省在兴办地方工业当中所碰到的最大的困难。但是中共江西省委及各级党委发动群众出穷主意、想土办法，帮助新建厂把困难一一排除了。他们运用技术归队、老厂输送、老师傅带徒弟、组织参观学习、办速成训练班、访贤拜师等办法，找到了大批“土专家”、“土工程师”。抚州专区运用上述办法已找到了近二千名“土工程师”。玉山县采取技术排队登记的办法，一次就从干部和转业军人中找到了数十名机电、化肥、测量技术人员。上饶、吉安等各地的许多老厂还提出“代训技工、来者不拒、保证教会”的保证，为新建厂迅速培养技术力量。此外，各县还成批地派出人员分赴省内外去“取经”。学习技术知识。
    解决技术设备不足问题的土办法也是多种多样的。除了一些较复杂的机器设备向外地购买以外，一般设备大都采取从现有老厂抽调、发动各机械厂试制等办法解决。上饶专区计划今年大办饲料加工厂，买不到机器，中共上饶地委便发动和组织上饶农具厂的工人们试制成功“万能粉碎机”，现在已大量生产，完全保证了全区建厂的需要。还有一种办法是实行“土机械化”。如峡江县新建的酿酒厂，原计划用机器生产，但是买不到蒸气钢管；后来群众想方设法，改用新法土制的办法，利用当地产的茅竹代钢管排蒸汽水，又省钱，效率和产品的质量也没有一点影响。（刘光辉）
