    Lang Yuxiu Performs at the Flower Fair
    The famous singer and head of the Vocal Music Department of the Southwest Conservatory of Music, Lang Yuxiu, gave three consecutive performances for the masses in a simple bamboo shed at the Chengdu "Flower Fair" on March 22nd. Her beautiful singing and enthusiasm won repeated applause from the audience.
    The "Flower Fair" is one of Chengdu's traditional markets held every year in the second month of the lunar calendar. For a whole month, it attracts hundreds of thousands of farmers, workers, and citizens from all over.
    After the performance, Lang Yuxiu said that this performance was the first step in realizing her recently established "both red and expert" plan for art to face the masses. She said: This plan seems too conservative. Originally, it was planned to perform eighty shows for workers and peasants this year without affecting teaching, but it is likely to break this target before the Flower Fair closes.

    郎毓秀到花会演唱
    著名歌唱家、西南音乐专科学校声乐系系主任郎毓秀，3月22日在成都“花会”上的一个简陋竹棚里为群众一连演唱了三场。她的优美的歌声和热情获得了听众的一再鼓掌。
    “花会”是成都每年旧历2月传统的市集之一。在整整一月内，吸引着来自各地的成千上万的农民、工人和市民。
    郎毓秀在演出后说，这次演出是实现她最近订的又红又专规划中艺术面向群众的第一步行动。她说：这个规划看来太保守了。原来订的在不影响教学下今年一年要为工农群众演出八十场，仅在花会闭幕以前，就可能突破这个指标。
