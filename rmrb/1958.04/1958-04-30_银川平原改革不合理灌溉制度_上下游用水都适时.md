Yinchuan Plain Reforms Unreasonable Irrigation System
    Ensuring Timely Water Use for Both Upstream and Downstream Areas
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Reporter Ma Yuping reports: The Yinchuan Plain, an area irrigated by the Yellow River and known as the "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall," is seeing Hui and Han farmers breaking with convention, increasing water sources, reducing waste, and reforming the irrigation system.
    On this Yellow River plain, which stretches six to seven hundred li, Hui and Han farmers are ensuring a great leap forward in production this year by undertaking water conservancy projects on a larger scale than in any previous year. They are boldly excavating the ancient Tanglai Canal, Qin Canal, and other canal outlets, and using a combination of grass, earth, and stone to build a "potential roller dam" on the Yellow River to raise the water level, increasing the water delivery capacity of the irrigation area by forty to fifty cubic meters per second. This ensures timely and adequate irrigation even during the peak water demand of crops and the low-water season of the Yellow River, while also guaranteeing water use for newly added irrigated land. These projects are now largely complete, and the Tanglai, Hanyan, and other main canals have already released water. Hui and Han farmers are working diligently to prepare for the first irrigation of wheat and the sowing of rice.
    Regarding the irrigation system, the first change this year is to address the unreasonable water allocation planning of the past. Instead of a top-down water allocation plan, a bottom-up approach is being adopted, making the plan more practical and avoiding water wastage. Secondly, the irrigation sequence is being changed from downstream-to-upstream to upstream-to-downstream. In the past, irrigating from downstream upwards was only done to ensure that the downstream areas received water. However, the downstream areas have lower temperatures, and crops grow and require water later, resulting in neither upstream nor downstream areas receiving timely irrigation. This change resolves the long-standing conflict between upstream and downstream water use, enabling both to irrigate in a timely and appropriate manner according to temperature and sequence. Thirdly, in terms of crop planting, this year "rice relocation" is being implemented, reducing the rice planting area in the upstream and increasing it in the downstream, so that the high land in the upstream, which is suitable for planting dryland crops, can be used for that purpose. In the Yinchuan area alone, over 100,000 mu of rice will be planted in the downstream area of the irrigation zone this year. In addition, small-plot irrigation is being further promoted, with all plots larger than two mu in the entire irrigation area being converted to plots of two mu or less. Ditch irrigation is also being promoted for sorghum, corn, and other cultivated crops, changing the habits of flood irrigation and sequential irrigation.
    The Yinchuan Plain is located in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which will soon be established in northern Gansu. This plain currently has over 3.54 million mu of irrigated land.

### 银川平原改革不合理灌溉制度  上下游用水都适时

    银川平原改革不合理灌溉制度
    上下游用水都适时
    本报讯　记者马玉平报道：被称为“塞上江南”的引黄灌溉区的银川平原，回汉族农民打破陈规，开源节流，改革灌溉制度。
    在这块纵长六、七百里的黄河平原上，回汉族农民为了保证今年生产大跃进，水利岁修工程较以往任何一年的规模都大。人们破格地辟挖古老的唐徕、秦渠等渠口，并采用草、土、石相结合的办法，在黄河上修筑一道提高黄河水位的“潜力滚水坝”，使灌区增加输水量四、五十秒公方。这样即使在农作物最需要用水和黄河枯水时期都能适时适量灌水，同时还能保证新增加水地的用水。现在这些工程已基本结束，唐徕、汉延等干渠已经放水，回汉族农民正在紧张地迎接浇灌小麦头次水和播种水稻工作。
    在灌溉制度上，今年首先改变了过去计划配水上不合理的情况，即改变过去由上而下作配水计划为由下而上的作配水计划，使计划配水更切合实际，避免浪费水的现象。其次是改先下而上的灌溉顺序为先上而下的灌溉顺序。过去采取由下而上的灌水，只是为了下游能灌上水，但下游气温低，作物生长和需水期晚，这样就造成上下游都不能适时灌水。改变以后，使这个多少年来上下游用水的矛盾得到解决，上下游都能够作到按照气温、顺序适时适量的灌水。第三，在作物播种上，今年实行“水稻搬家”，即减少上游水稻播种面积，增加下游水稻面积，使上游适宜种旱田作物的高地种旱田作物。仅银川专区今年就要在灌区下游增种水稻十万多亩。此外，进一步推广小块灌溉，把全灌区二亩以上的地块全部改为二亩以下的小块；高粱、玉米等中耕作物并推广沟灌，改变大水漫灌和串灌的习惯。
    银川平原在甘肃北部即将成立的宁夏回族自治区。这块平原现在有水浇地三百五十四万多亩。
