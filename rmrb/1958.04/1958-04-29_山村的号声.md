    The Bugle Call of the Mountain Village
    Tu'an

    The sun has already set. In the Tumu Township Unity Agricultural Production Cooperative, I saw the bugler watching the clock's hands. One second, one minute, and then, at seven thirty, the bell rang suddenly. The bugler ran to the street, raised his bugle, and blew it. The majestic and sonorous bugle call spread like a flood from the center of the mountain village to all directions. Before long, the bugle call also came from West Street; almost at the same time, the bugle call also came from East Street. Three bugles sounded at the same time, and the mountain village suddenly became lively.

    Cooperative cadres and all the production team leaders gathered at the cooperative headquarters, where the kerosene lamps were burning brightly. Deputy Political Cooperative Leader Lao Qin announced the start of the study session, and Cooperative Accountant Lao Liu began to read the People's Daily editorial. Everyone listened attentively. Outside, lights were also lit in the various production teams, and civil school teachers were writing "Agriculture Program…" on the small blackboard. The students' loud reading sounds carried to the street. I walked toward the elementary school, where the spare-time junior middle school class was in session. Upon entering the classroom, I saw that the carbide lamp, even brighter than the kerosene lamp, illuminated the red glow of labor on the faces of the young men and women. Before the formal start of the class, this class first spent two weeks studying the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, taught by Teacher Xu, the director of studies at the elementary school. Today they were learning the phonetic alphabet song, and the loud singing poured out of the windows and doors of the classroom, which had been converted from a temple, attracting many children to cling to the windows to watch.

    At half past eight, the bugle sounded again, and class was over. I followed the students out of the classroom. The enthusiastic young farmers greeted me and smiled at me. We walked to the street. Although the east wind was still chilly, we felt very hot in our hearts; there was no moon in the sky, but we felt very bright in our hearts. I rushed to the cooperative headquarters to attend the cooperative cadres' meeting. Usually, meetings often started at nine o'clock after waiting for people, but now, with class ending at half past eight, the meeting started immediately.

    When the east wind had not yet reached this mountain village and the ice and snow had not yet melted, I had mentioned to Lao Qin how to cultivate the habit of punctuality among the peasants. Since ancient times, peasants have worked at sunrise (not necessarily resting at sunset), and they are particularly dissatisfied with people who sleep in. But it is difficult to get peasants to study and attend meetings on time. "Not afraid of being tired for the Great Leap Forward, not afraid of having more meetings at night, work hard for a few years for happiness, put on wings and fly forward." This is the farmers' bold statement today. It is very clear here: not afraid of being tired, not afraid of having more meetings at night, is for the Great Leap Forward. However, many meetings are tiring because people do not keep time. Several hours before the meeting are wasted waiting for people and chatting idly. Wouldn't it be better to both achieve the Great Leap Forward and ensure rest? If production is to leap forward, why can't cultivating the habit of punctuality leap forward? Lao Qin also felt that this was a problem, and his solution was to strike the bell and urge people on. Several months have passed, and the habit has not changed.

    On April 9th, under the leadership of the superior Party committee, the cooperative established a cultural education popularization shock brigade. In just one day, all the school-age children in the cooperative enrolled in school, almost all the young and middle-aged illiterates entered literacy classes, some primary school graduates entered higher primary school, some were incorporated into spare-time higher primary school classes, higher primary school graduates established spare-time junior middle school classes, and cooperative cadres also decided to study regularly. The organizational work was all ready, waiting for the start of classes. Several days passed, and classes did not start on time, people did not arrive completely, in twos and threes, dragging their feet. This won't do! The realization of popularizing cultural education's organizational work is an unprecedented event, but we cannot stop here! Deputy Political Cooperative Leader Lao Qin, a demobilized soldier, came up with a solution: watch the clock, blow the bugle. There are three people in the cooperative who can blow the bugle, one to lead and two to follow, to urge all the students in the village. If anyone is still late, the first time they will be advised, the second time they will be debated, and the third time they will be reported. This is really a good idea, and they immediately took action the next day.

    Tumu is a large village with more than six hundred households, with a street three li long from east to west. In the past, the method of ringing the bell was used to call meetings. The middle bell would ring first, and the bells in the east and west streets would follow; but the bells here are all small bells left over from ancient temples, with a small volume. The bugle, on the other hand, not only has a large volume that everyone in the village can hear, but also has a power to inspire people. The leadership requires us to have combat-like action and military-like organization, and using the bugle to mobilize is the most appropriate thing to do.

### 山村的号声

    山村的号声
    屠岸
    太阳已经落山了。在土木乡团结农业生产合作社里，我看见司号员注视着闹钟的指针，一秒，一分，到了七点半，突然铃声响了，司号员奔到街上，举起号筒，吹了起来，雄壮嘹喨的号声在山村的中心像洪水般向四面涌去；不一会儿，西街也传来了号声；差不多同时东街也传来了号声。三把号筒同时吹响，山村顿时活跃了起来。
    社干部、生产队正队长全都集中到社部，煤油灯点得亮堂堂的。政治副社长老秦宣布学习开始，社会计老刘读起了人民日报社论，大家都聚精会神地听着。外面，各生产队里也点起了灯，民校教师在小黑板上写着“农、业、纲、要……”学员们琅琅的读书声传到了街上。我往小学校走去，业余初中班正在那里上课。一进教室就见到比煤油灯还亮的电石灯照出了一个个男女青年脸上的劳动的红光。这个班在正式开课前，先突击两星期学习汉语拼音方案，由小学校的教务主任徐老师来教他们。今天教拼音字母歌，洪亮的歌声从那庙宇改建的教室门窗里往外面涌出去，吸引了不少孩子扒在窗口看。
    八点半钟，号声又响了，下课了。我随着学员们走出教室。热情的青年农民向我招呼，向我笑。我们走到了街上。东风吹来虽然还有寒意，但我们的心中感到非常热；天上没有月亮，但我们的心中感到非常亮堂。我赶到社部去参加社干部的会议。平时开会，往往等人等到九点才开，如今八点半下课，立即就开了会。
    当东风还没有吹到这山村，冰雪还没有化开的时候，我就曾跟老秦提起过如何在农民中培养遵守时间的习惯这个问题。从古以来，农民是日出而作（不一定日入而息），他们对睡懒觉的人特别不满。但要农民按时学习、开会却有困难。“为了跃进不怕累，不怕晚上多开会，苦战几年幸福来，插上翅膀往前飞。”这是今天农民的豪言壮语。这里说得很清楚：不怕累、不怕晚上多开会是为了跃进。然而有许多会开得人很累是由于大家不遵守时间。开会前好几个小时就在等人、闲聊中浪费掉了。要是既能跃进，又能保证休息，这不更好吗？生产要跃进，为什么培养遵守时间的习惯不能跃进？老秦也感到这是个问题，他提出的办法是打钟加上?喝。几个月过去了，习惯仍然未改。
    4月9日，在上级党委的领导下，社里成立了普及文化教育突击队，仅仅一天功夫，全社的学龄儿童全部报名入了学，青壮年文盲几乎全部进了扫盲班，初小毕业生有的进了高小，有的编入了业余高小班，高小毕业生成立了业余初中班，社干部也决定经常学习。组织工作都作好了，就等开课。几天过去了，没有按时上课，人到不齐，三三两两，拖拖拉拉。这不行！实现了普及文化教育的组织工作，这是一件空前的大事，但不能停留在这里！政治副社长老秦是个复员军人，他想出了个办法：看时钟，吹军号，社里有三个会吹号的，一把带头，两把跟上，把全村的学员都?喝起来。如果还有人迟到，第一次劝告，第二次辩论，第三次上报。这真是个好办法，第二天就立即行动起来了。
    土木是六百多户的大村，一条街从东到西三里长。过去用打钟的办法召集会议，中间一口钟先打起来，东街西街的钟跟着打；但这里的钟都是古庙里留下的小钟，音量小。而号筒呢，不仅音量大，全村人人可听到，而且有一种振奋人心的力量。领导上要求我们行动战斗化，组织军事化，用号筒来动员是最适当不过的了。
