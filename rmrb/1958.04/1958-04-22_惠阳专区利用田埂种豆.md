Huiyang Special Zone utilizes field ridges to grow soybeans

This year, Huiyang Special Zone in Guangdong Province will make full use of 6.3 million mu of field ridges to plant soybeans. Calculated at 10 jin of soybeans produced per mu of field ridge, these ridges will produce 63 million jin of soybeans.

In 1956, the national average yield of soybeans was more than 114 jin per mu. Based on this average yield, Huiyang Special Zone's use of field ridges to grow soybeans this year is equivalent to expanding soybean fields by more than 552,000 mu.

    惠阳专区利用田埂种豆
    广东惠阳专区今年将充分利用六百三十万亩田埂种植黄豆。以每亩田埂可产黄豆十斤计算，这些田埂将产黄豆六千三百万斤。
    1956年全国黄豆平均亩产一百一十四斤多，以这个平均产量计算，惠阳专区今年利用田埂种植黄豆，就等于扩大豆田五十五万二千多亩。
