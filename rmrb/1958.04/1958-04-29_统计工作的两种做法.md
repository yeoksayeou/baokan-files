Two Approaches to Statistical Work

From the news "Hebei Uses Statistical Work to Promote Production" on page three of today's newspaper, it appears that there are two approaches to statistical work: one is cold and quiet, and the other is vigorous and enthusiastic. In the past, statistical work was often considered to be something that should be done in a cold and quiet manner. However, with the arrival of the production upsurge, many statistical workers were unwilling to remain isolated and wanted to participate in the torrent of the production upsurge. As a result, in some areas, statistical work has changed from a cold and quiet state to a vigorous and enthusiastic one, and a great leap forward in statistical work has emerged in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

Why was statistical work so cold and quiet in many areas in the past? How can it be changed from cold and quiet to vigorous and enthusiastic? The example of Hebei Province provides us with a very good answer. It turns out that past statistical work was constrained by metaphysical thinking. It closed itself off in the temple of dogmatism. Despite the noise and excitement outside, they remained steadfast, adhering to those rigid rules, believing that this was the only way to do statistical work. No wonder statistical work was so cold and quiet.

In the recent rectification campaign, the State Statistical Bureau found serious tendencies of dogmatism in the leadership of statistical work. In the past few years, they had criticized this to some extent, but they always dealt with specific issues, checking report forms and indicators, and checking rules and regulations, without checking the root cause in thinking, and without solving the problem politically and ideologically. Therefore, although there were some partial improvements in report forms and indicators and rules and regulations, on the whole, they became more and more cumbersome. This time, the focus of their examination was on talking about politics and ideology, and on following the mass line, mobilizing the masses to conduct the examination. As a result, the ideological crux was found.

First, they value books and reports, but not political tasks. There seems to be a tendency: anything said in books must be followed; and anything not mentioned in books, even if it is very beneficial to the revolution and construction, is not taken seriously. Some statistical cadres went to various counties in Hebei and saw that people were working enthusiastically, but they were still doubtful in their hearts: what is the basis for their approach? It cannot be found in any book. Will it go astray? These bookworms should be awakened. Whether things are done well or not depends mainly on whether they contribute to the revolution and construction, and the size of the contribution; and not on whether it is in the books. Books are merely a summary of past experience and should be constantly supplemented with new experience. The new experiences created by the masses are often not in the books. We should value practice and the creativity of the masses, and carefully collect, organize and promote the experiences created by the masses to continuously improve our statistical work.

China's existing statistics textbooks do have shortcomings. Most of these textbooks are translated from foreign languages or are based on foreign textbooks, and they contain little or no Chinese experience. When we study these textbooks, we should combine them with our own experience and develop a spirit of innovation. Statistical leading organs and statistical professional schools have the responsibility to sort out and summarize China's own experience to compile statistics textbooks that are suitable for our own needs.

Second, they value business but not politics; they do not pay attention to learning theory when learning business, but only learn specific methods. This is a purely technical point of view, and as a result, lively things are handled in a lifeless manner. Politics is the commander and the soul. Without talking about politics, just talking about business is easy to lose direction and not know who statistics is serving. When we study statistical business, we should first study the Marxist-Leninist statistical theory, and use the Marxist-Leninist statistical theory as the guide, and establish our own statistical work according to our needs and subjective and objective conditions. This is the correct learning method. Not learning theory, but only moving specific methods, from report forms and indicators to classification catalogs, are all copied hard. This is a complete dogmatic learning method. The things learned in this way are bound to be unsuitable for actual needs. Because specific methods always vary from place to place and from time to time, not to mention between different countries, even in one country, the methods adopted in cities and villages, and in revolutionary periods and construction periods, will be different.

Third, they mystify statistical work, as if this is something that only experts can do. Under the guidance of this idea, they will only believe in themselves and not in others; they will only believe in the statistical team they lead, and not in the local areas, and not in the masses. Because of the mystification of statistical work, statistical work cannot get the full leadership of the Party and the government, nor can it get the support of the broad masses, and it isolates itself. Of course, this will lead to many difficulties and the work cannot be carried out. The experience of Hebei Province tells us that as long as we rely on the local areas and rely on the masses, any difficulties can be overcome. And to get the support of the local areas and the masses, we must combine with the needs of the local areas and the masses, not stand outside the production upsurge, but plunge into this torrent, and conscientiously serve production, and serve the local areas and the masses; we must break the mystery and popularize statistical work. The wisdom and strength of the masses are endless. They can change the face of the country, and of course they also have the power to change the face of statistical work and make it look brand new. The experience of Hebei Province has fully proved this point.

Fourth, they value rules and regulations, but not political ideology, and they value things over people; they even only see numbers, and cannot even see things. They regard the construction of statistical work as the construction of rules and regulations, and they are busy all day long formulating report forms, stipulating methods, and the more the better, the finer the better. As a result, many rules and regulations not only bind the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, but even bind their own hands and feet. Rules and regulations were originally created by people, but in the eyes of dogmatists, they are like the bodhisattvas in the temple, and seem to be able to control the fate of mankind, and they are afraid to change them in the slightest. Such rules and regulations will not promote statistical work, but are likely to hinder it. In the current production upsurge, some unreasonable rules and regulations may also hinder the production upsurge. Without being liberated from unreasonable rules and regulations, it is impossible to have a great leap forward in statistical work.

The statistical work of Hebei Province has adopted completely different methods from the above-mentioned methods. Their methods can be summarized into three points:

First, combine statistical work with the central work of the Party and with the production upsurge of the masses. In this way, statistical work becomes a powerful weapon to promote production and guide work, and statistical work itself changes from cold and quiet to vigorous and enthusiastic.

Second, grasp the leadership of political ideology, talk about principles and directions, and talk less or not about specific methods. In the past, every time a task was assigned, a plan had to be designed, report forms had to be formulated, and a set of cumbersome methods often took several months to wear down, making it difficult to move forward. Such a leadership method cannot adapt to the current situation of the production upsurge, and it will bind the creativity of the local areas and the masses. Only by adopting new leadership methods can statistical work be truly combined with the production upsurge.

Third, rely on the local areas and rely on the masses to promote work and overcome all difficulties.

After statistical work left the cold and quiet road and embarked on the vigorous and enthusiastic road, it played a huge role in promoting the production upsurge and changing the leadership style, and it also made a great leap forward in statistical work itself. Some people are afraid that statistical cadres will be involved in the production upsurge, will abandon their business, will not do their job, and may not be able to complete the statistical tasks stipulated above. The facts are completely opposite. Statistical work serves the production upsurge, so that statistical work takes root among the masses, and statistical cadres often grasp the actual situation, which not only makes it easier to complete the statistical tasks stipulated above, but also ensures the accuracy of the data.

Hebei Province has not only created new experiences for statistical work, but also found a new direction for statistical work. Therefore, it is worthy of being recommended to statistical workers across the country. Of course, when learning from the experience of Hebei Province, all localities should learn from its principles and directions, and not necessarily learn from every specific method. From the perspective of specific methods, they should adapt to local conditions and adapt to the times, and even Hebei Province itself should constantly improve and create. In fact, Hebei is not the only province that has touched this new road. Other provinces also have many good examples waiting for us to discover and introduce.

Finally, it should also be pointed out that the problems to be solved by statistical work are multifaceted, and what is introduced here is mainly rural statistical work. Statistical work in other areas should also learn this new spirit, go deep into practice, go deep into the masses, liberate their minds, and adopt various different methods based on facts, and move forward with the broad masses!

### 统计工作的两种做法

    统计工作的两种做法
    从今天本报三版所载“河北运用统计工作促进生产”的消息看来，统计工作也有冷冷清清和轰轰烈烈两种做法。过去统计工作往往被认为是应该冷冷清清的，可是生产高潮来了以后，许多统计工作同志也不甘寂寞，愿意参加到生产高潮的洪流中去，于是有些地区的统计工作也就从冷冷清清变为轰轰烈烈的局面，在工业农业生产的大跃进中，也就出现了统计工作的大跃进。
    为什么过去许多地区的统计工作是那样冷冷清清呢？怎样才能从冷冷清清变为轰轰烈烈呢？河北省的例子为我们提供了很好的答案。原来，过去的统计工作是被形而上学的思想束缚住了，自己把自己关闭在教条主义的寺庙中间，尽管外面锣鼓喧天，热闹非凡，他们还是一心不乱，守着那些清规戒律，以为非如此就不是统计工作。这就难怪把统计工作弄得冷冷清清了。
    国家统计局最近在整风中，检查出在统计工作的领导上有严重的教条主义倾向。过去几年他们也曾对此有所批评，但总是就事论事，查报表指标，查规章制度，而没有查思想根源，没有从政治上、思想上来解决问题。因此报表指标和规章制度虽有某些局部的改进，但总的来说，仍是愈来愈繁。这次他们检查的重点是谈政治、谈思想，并且走群众路线，发动群众进行检查。结果查出了思想上的症结所在。
    第一，重视书本，重视报表，不重视政治任务。似乎有这样一种倾向：凡书本上讲的东西都要照办；而书本上没有讲过的东西，则即使对革命、对建设十分有利，也不认真进行。有些统计干部跑到河北各县，看人家搞得热火朝天，心中还在怀疑：他们这样搞法究竟有何根据？哪个书本中都找不出来，会不会走上邪路？应该唤醒这些书本主义者，事情办得好不好，主要看它对革命有无贡献，对建设有无贡献，以及贡献的大小；而不在书本上有没有。书本仅仅是过去经验的总结，应当不断地用新的经验来补充。从来群众创造出来的新的经验，常常是书本上没有的。应当重视实际，重视群众的创造，好好收集、整理和推广群众所创造的经验，来不断地改进我们的统计工作。
    我国现有的统计学教科书确实是有缺点的，这些教科书多半是从外国翻译过来的，或者是根据外国的教科书编写而成的，其中没有或者很少中国自己的经验。我们学习这些教科书的时候，应该结合我国自己的经验，发扬创造精神。统计领导机关和统计专业学校有责任整理和总结我国自己的经验，来编写适合于我们自己需要的统计学教科书。
    第二，轻政治、重业务；在学习业务时不重视学习理论，而只学习具体方法，这是一种单纯技术观点，结果把生动活泼的事情办得死气沉沉。政治是统帅是灵魂，不谈政治，只谈业务就很容易迷失方向，不知道统计究竟为谁服务。在我们学习统计业务的时候，也应该首先学习马克思列宁主义的统计理论，以马克思列宁主义统计理论为主导，根据我国的需要和主观客观条件，来建立我们自己的统计工作，这才是正确的学习方法。不学习理论，只搬运具体方法，从报表、指标一直到分类目录，都是硬搬照抄，这就是十足的教条主义学习方法。这样学来的东西，就必然不适合于实际需要。因为具体方法总是因地因时不同，不要说不同国家之间，就是在一个国家中，城市同乡村，革命时期同建设时期，所采取的方法也会有不同的。
    第三，把统计工作神秘化，好像这是只有专家才能办的事情。在这种思想的指导下，就会只相信自己，不相信别人；只相信自己所领导的统计队伍，不相信地方，不相信群众。由于把统计工作神秘化，因此就使统计工作既不能得到党和政府的充分领导，又不能得到广大群众的支持，把自己孤立起来。当然这样就会困难重重，工作无法开展。河北省的经验告诉我们，只要依靠地方，依靠群众，任何困难都是可以克服的。而要得到地方和群众的支持，就必须同地方的、群众的需要结合起来，不是站在生产高潮外面，而是投入这个洪流中去，认真地为生产服务，为地方和群众服务；就必须打破神秘，把统计工作群众化。群众的智慧和力量是无穷无尽的，他们能够改变国家的面貌，当然也有力量改变统计工作的面貌，使它焕然一新，河北省的经验已充分地证明了这一点。
    第四，重视规章制度，不重视政治思想，重物轻人；甚至只看到数字，连物也看不到了。他们把统计工作的建设当作就是规章制度的建设，整天忙于制订报表，规定办法，搞得愈多愈好，愈细愈好。结果许多规章制度不但束缚了群众的积极性和创造性，甚至把他们自己的手足也束缚起来。规章制度本来是人创造的，但在教条主义者看来，却像庙里面的菩萨一样，似乎是能够支配人类命运的东西，战战兢兢丝毫不敢改变。这样的规章制度，对统计工作是不会起促进作用，而是很可能起促退作用的。在目前的生产高潮中间，有些不合理的规章制度也可能对生产高潮起促退作用。不从不合理的规章制度中解放出来，是决不可能出现统计工作的大跃进的。
    河北省的统计工作采取了同上面所说的完全不同的办法，他们的办法归纳起来有三点：
    一是把统计工作同党的中心工作结合起来，同群众的生产高潮结合起来。这样，统计工作就成为推动生产，指导工作的有力武器，统计工作本身也从冷冷清清，变为轰轰烈烈。
    二是抓住政治思想领导，讲方针、方向，不讲或少讲具体方法。过去每布置一个任务就要设计方案，制订报表，一套繁琐办法，往往消磨几个月的时间，弄得寸步难行。这样的领导方法，是决不能适应目前的生产高潮的形势的，而且会束缚地方和群众的创造性。只有采取新的领导方法，才能使统计工作真正同生产高潮结合起来。
    三是依靠地方，依靠群众来推进工作，克服一切困难。
    统计工作离开了冷冷清清的道路，走上轰轰烈烈的道路以后，它就发挥了促进生产高潮，转变领导作风的巨大作用，而且使统计工作本身也出现了一个大跃进。有人害怕，统计干部卷入生产高潮，就会抛弃自己的业务，就会不务本业，就有可能完不成上面所规定的统计任务。事实完全相反，统计工作为生产高潮服务，就使统计工作在群众中间生根，就使统计干部经常掌握实际情况，不但更容易完成上面所规定的统计任务，而且更能保证资料的正确性。
    河北省不但为统计工作创造了新经验，而且为统计工作找到了新方向，因此这是值得向全国统计工作人员推荐的。当然，各地在学习河北省经验的时候，应该学习它的方针方向，而不一定要去学习每一个具体方法。从具体方法方面来讲，应该因地制宜，因时制宜，就连河北省自己也应当不断改进，不断创造。事实上，已经摸到这条新道路的决不只河北一省，其它各省同样也有很多好的典型，等待我们去发掘和介绍。
    最后还应指出，统计工作所要解决的问题是多方面的，这里所介绍的主要只是乡村统计工作。其他方面的统计工作也应当学习这种新的精神，深入实际，深入群众，解放思想，实事求是采取各种不同的方法，跟着广大群众大踏步地前进！
