    Fraternal Mutual Assistance Among Socialist Countries
    Soviet Union　Dé·Jiégéli
    The fact that the foundation of mutual relations between socialist countries is the time-tested Marxist-Leninist principle, the principle of proletarian internationalism, is of great significance for the economic development of socialist countries. The Declaration of the Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the Socialist Countries states: "Socialist countries base their mutual relations on the principles of complete equal rights, respect for territorial integrity, respect for national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. These principles are very important, but they do not encompass the entire essence of the mutual relations between socialist countries. Fraternal mutual assistance is an integral part of their mutual relations. This mutual assistance powerfully embodies the socialist principle of internationalism."
    Extensive economic and cultural cooperation plays an important role in consolidating the economic and political independence of each autonomous socialist country and in consolidating the entire socialist family.
    Providing complete sets of equipment needed for enterprises and providing technical assistance in the construction of these enterprises are excellent examples of fraternal mutual assistance among socialist countries. In 1956, the total value of complete sets of enterprise equipment supplied by the Soviet Union to other socialist countries reached approximately 1.2 billion rubles, an increase of more than eleven times compared to 1950.
    With the help of the Soviet Union, nearly 500 enterprises have been built or are under construction in socialist countries. These enterprises can produce 15 million tons of steel, approximately 120,000 tons of copper, more than 12,000 tons of tin, more than 4.5 million tons of petroleum products, more than 850,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, 141,000 tons of sulfuric acid, more than 500,000 tons of alkali, 55,000 automobiles, and approximately 40,000 tractors annually. Among these enterprises are power stations with a total power generation capacity of 8 million kilowatts, which will generate 23 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually.
    For the sake of comparison, we can look at the situation before World War II. At that time, the total electricity production in the region of the current socialist countries in Europe and Asia (excluding the Soviet Union) was only about 32 billion kilowatt-hours, steel production was just over 6 million tons, nitrogen fertilizer production was about 500,000 tons, sulfuric acid production was 940,000 tons, caustic soda and soda ash production was 970,000 tons, automobile production was about 95,000 vehicles, and tractor production was 1,500 units.
    In addition to the Soviet Union, some other socialist countries also export complete sets of equipment. For example, Czechoslovakia provides complete sets of equipment for power stations, chemical plants, cement factories, and other enterprises that are being built in socialist countries. The German Democratic Republic also exports complete sets of equipment for building power stations, rolling mills, chemical plants, cement factories, and many light and food industry enterprises. Poland provides complete sets of equipment for building sulfuric acid factories, cement factories, sugar mills, and other enterprises.
    The joint construction of industrial enterprises and other projects by many socialist countries is also a manifestation of fraternal mutual assistance. For example, Romania, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Poland are jointly building a combined cellulose factory in Braila, Romania, using reeds from the Danube Delta as raw materials. Romania and Hungary are jointly expanding the soda factory located in Ocna Mureș. Hungary and Romania are also jointly working on the utilization of Romanian natural gas. Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia have decided to work together to utilize Polish lignite.
    The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Mongolian People's Republic jointly laid the Jining-Erlian-Ulaanbaatar railway line linking the three countries. The Soviet Union and China are jointly constructing the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway.
    A portion of industrial equipment and other commodities is provided to fraternal countries in the form of loans. During the post-war period, the Soviet Union provided many loans to socialist countries. The People's Republic of China, Poland, and Czechoslovakia have also provided loans to socialist brother countries.
    Fraternal mutual assistance is also reflected in the scientific and technological cooperation among socialist countries. This cooperation is achieved through the following channels: exchanging technical design documents for industrial enterprise construction projects, various product production methods, and advanced technological processes; sending experts to learn about scientific and technological achievements and advanced production experiences; direct contacts between scientific research institutions in socialist countries; and mutual research, evaluation, consultation, and scientific conferences.
    Socialist countries have concluded long-term scientific and technological cooperation agreements. During the implementation of scientific and technological cooperation, the Soviet Union has provided more than 9,000 sets of technical design documents for capital construction, machinery and equipment manufacturing, and technological processes to various socialist countries, and has also obtained more than 2,000 sets of such technical design documents from other socialist countries.
    In recent years, the connections between scientific research units, design units, and other scientific units in socialist countries have been widely developed. More than 200 research institutes in the Soviet Union have established such connections with 250 research institutes in socialist countries. For example, according to an agreement concluded between the Soviet Union and China, the two countries will jointly solve 122 major scientific and technological problems between 1958 and 1962. The establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, equipped with the most sophisticated equipment, is a clear example of scientific cooperation among socialist countries. The task of this institute is to make a significant contribution to the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    In 1957 alone, the Soviet Union sent more than 2,000 experts to other socialist countries and received more than 2,500 experts in the country.
    Scientific and technological cooperation among socialist countries has brought tremendous benefits to each country. For example, due to the visit of staff from the Brandenburg Steel Rolling Plant (in the German Democratic Republic) to the Soviet Union in 1955 and the return visit of Soviet experts, the daily steel output of this plant has increased by 180 tons to 200 tons. The German Democratic Republic has also learned good working experiences in certain industrial sectors from Czechoslovakia, Romania, Poland, Hungary, China, and other countries. For example, by studying the operation methods of the Chinese textile industry, the spindle productivity of the German Democratic Republic's textile industry has increased by nearly 12%.
    The Soviet Union also utilizes the scientific and technological experiences of other countries. In Soviet industry, the Czechoslovak method of producing molds has been successfully adopted, reducing the labor required for manufacturing dies by almost nine-tenths and increasing the robustness by a factor of two. Soviet experts have learned from Hungary's experience in extracting coal from waste coal piles in coal mines. Calculated in terms of coal that can generate one million calories of heat, the cost of using this method to refine coal is 32% cheaper than mining it from mines. As a result of adopting Polish-style trawls in the Baltic Sea, the catch of anchovies has increased by 50% to 100%. As a result of applying German and Czechoslovakian experiences in porcelain factories in the Soviet Union, the productivity of tunnel kilns has increased by 17%, the productivity of down-draft kilns has increased by 30%, fuel consumption has been reduced by 20%, and product quality has been improved.
    Socialist countries also cooperate in the training of technical cadres. Approximately 14,000 undergraduates and postgraduates from various socialist countries are studying in Soviet higher education institutions alone.
    Between 1955 and 1957, socialist countries did a lot of work in coordinating annual and long-term plans for the development of the national economy, on the premise of ensuring the interests of each country and the common interests of all countries in the socialist family. Significant work has also been carried out in the specialization and collaboration of the main sectors of the national economy of socialist countries.
    Due to the development of specialization and collaboration in production among socialist countries, it is possible to plan the use of the most favorable natural and economic conditions in each country to produce certain products, and then exchange them with each other.
    Due to the specialization and collaboration of production, product items can be reduced and the scale of production can be expanded, which creates conditions for the adoption of large-scale assembly line operations and promotes the improvement of labor productivity, the reduction of product costs, the improvement of product quality, and the profitability of production.
    The coordination of the Five-Year Plans is a new stage in the development of multi-faceted economic cooperation among socialist countries. The coordination of long-term plans and long-term trade agreements promotes the development of production specialization and collaboration and provides a solid foundation for the socialist international division of labor.
    The coordination of development plans has been implemented in the main production sectors of machine manufacturing, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, coal mining, petroleum, gas, chemical industry and light industry, as well as in the main sectors of agriculture. This coordination is to ensure the consistency of the most important product production levels, determine the types of machinery, lathes, and equipment, and distribute production among countries to avoid unnecessary duplication. At the same time, cooperation is also carried out in mutually providing major machines, lathes, equipment, raw materials, fuels, and grains.
    The implementation of specialization and collaboration in production can determine a consistent technical policy in important production sectors.
    The coordination of long-term plans for the national economy can identify weak links in the national economic development of individual socialist countries and take measures to eliminate them. For example, after studying the issue of the raw material base for the development of the ferrous metallurgy industry, the Soviet Union will greatly expand the mining of iron ore and the quantity of supply to socialist countries.
    The coordination of long-term plans for the development of agriculture in socialist countries is to greatly expand the production of agricultural products, especially the production of grain, widely sow maize, expand the chemical fertilizer industry, and produce modern agricultural machinery.
    It is very important to emphasize that the specialization and collaboration of production in socialist countries, as well as the growing socialist international division of labor, are carried out simultaneously with the comprehensive development of each country's economy. Therefore, the socialist international division of labor helps to coordinate the development of the national economies of socialist countries and promotes the convergence of their national economic development levels on the basis of comprehensive fraternal mutual assistance.
    Currently, the state planning agencies, various departments, scientific research institutions, and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of socialist countries are working hard to formulate cooperative long-term plans for ten to fifteen years.
    Fraternal mutual assistance is an integral part of the relations between socialist countries. This mutual assistance is a huge driving force for catching up with and surpassing advanced capitalist countries in the economic field, that is, in terms of per capita product production, in a very short historical period.

    社会主义国家兄弟般的互助
    苏联　德·捷格加里
    社会主义国家相互关系的基础，是久经考验的马克思列宁主义原则，是无产阶级国际主义原则，这一事实对于社会主义国家经济的发展有巨大的意义。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中说道：“社会主义各国把相互关系建立在完全平等、尊重领土完整、尊重国家独立和主权、互不干涉内政的原则上。这一些原则是很重要的，但是还没有包括社会主义国家的相互关系的全部实质。兄弟般的互相援助，是它们的相互关系的不可分割的部分。这种互相援助有力地体现了社会主义的国际主义原则。”
    广泛的经济和文化合作，对于巩固每一个自主的社会主义国家的经济和政治的独立，对于巩固整个社会主义大家庭，起着重要的作用。
    提供装备企业所需的全套设备和在建筑这些企业上给予技术援助，是社会主义国家兄弟般互助的优良范例。1956年，苏联供给其他社会主义国家的整套企业设备，总值约达十二亿卢布，即比1950年增加十一倍以上。
    社会主义各国在苏联的帮助下，已经建成和正在兴建的企业差不多有五百个。这些企业每年可以生产一千五百万吨钢、约十二万吨铜、一万二千多吨锡、四百五十多万吨石油产品、八十五万多吨氮肥、十四万一千吨硫酸、五十多万吨碱、五万五千辆汽车、约四万台拖拉机等。在这些企业中间，还有总发电能力达八百万瓩的发电站，这些发电站每年将生产电力二百三十亿度。
    为了比较起见，我们可以看一下第二次世界大战以前的情况。那时现在的欧亚两洲社会主义国家地区（苏联除外），总共才生产约三百二十亿度电力、六百多万吨钢、约五十万吨氮肥、九十四万吨硫酸、九十七万吨烧碱和纯碱、约九万五千辆汽车和一千五百台拖拉机。
    除了苏联以外，其他一些社会主义国家也出口整套的设备。例如，捷克斯洛伐克为社会主义国家中正在建设的发电站、化学工厂和水泥工厂以及其他企业提供整套设备。德意志民主共和国也出口建设发电站、压延车间、化学工厂、水泥工厂和许多轻工业和食品工业企业的整套设备。波兰提供建设硫酸工厂、水泥厂、制糖厂以及其他企业的整套设备。
    许多社会主义国家协力建设工业企业和其他项目，也是兄弟般互助的表现。例如，罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰，利用多瑙河三角洲上的芦苇作原料，正在罗马尼亚的布来拉共同兴建一个生产纤维素的联合工厂。罗马尼亚和匈牙利正在共同扩建位于奥克纳—木里希的苏打工厂。匈牙利和罗马尼亚还在共同进行利用罗马尼亚天然煤气的工作。波兰、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克已决定共同协力来利用波兰的褐煤。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国共同敷设了联结三个国家的集宁—二连—乌兰巴托铁路干线。苏联和中国正在共同修建兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路。
    有一部分工业设备和其他商品是以贷款方式提供给兄弟国家的。战后期间，苏联给了社会主义国家很多贷款。中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克也向社会主义兄弟国家提供了贷款。
    兄弟般的互助也表现在社会主义国家的科学技术合作上。这种合作是通过下列各种途径实现的：互换关于工业企业建筑工程、各种产品的生产和先进工艺规程的技术设计书；互派专家了解科学技术成就和先进生产经验；社会主义各国科学研究机关之间的直接联系以及互相研究、鉴定、谘询、举行科学会议等。
    社会主义国家之间缔结了长期的科学技术合作协定。在实现科学技术合作期间，苏联向各社会主义国家提供了九千多套基本建设、机器设备制造和工艺规程等方面的技术设计书，同时也从其他社会主义国家获得了两千多套这样的技术设计书。
    最近几年来，社会主义各国的科学研究单位、设计单位以及其他一些科学单位之间的联系，有了广泛的发展。苏联二百多个研究所同社会主义各国的二百五十个研究所建立了这种联系。例如，根据苏联同中国缔结的协定，两国将在1958年到1962年期间共同解决一百二十二项重大的科学技术问题。配备有最精良设备的联合核子研究所的成立，也是社会主义国家科学合作的明显事例。这个研究所的任务是要对和平利用原子能事业作出重大的贡献。
    仅在1957年，苏联就向其他社会主义国家派遣了二千多名专家，并且在本国接待了二千五百多名专家。
    社会主义国家的科学技术合作，使每个国家都得到巨大的良好成果。例如，由于勃兰登堡轧钢厂（在德意志民主共和国）的工作人员1955年访问了苏联和苏联专家的回访，这个工厂每天的钢产量已增加了一百八十吨到二百吨。德意志民主共和国也从捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、波兰、匈牙利、中国和其他国家吸取某些工业部门的良好工作经验。例如，由于学习了中国纺织工业的操作法，德意志民主共和国纺织工业的纱锭生产率提高了将近12％。
    苏联也利用其他国家的科学技术经验。在苏联工业中，成功地采用了捷克斯洛伐克生产铸模的方法，把制造冲模的劳动量几乎减少了十分之九，而且把坚固性提高了一倍。苏联专家吸取了匈牙利在煤矿的废煤堆中提取煤的经验，如以能发出一百万卡热量的煤为计算单位，使用这种方法精选比从矿井中开采成本便宜32％。在波罗的海采用波兰式曳网的结果，使鳁鱼的捕获量扩大了50％至一倍。苏联由于在瓷器工厂中运用德国和捷克斯洛伐克经验的结果，使隧道窑的生产率提高了17％，倒焰窑的生产率提高了30％，降低燃料消耗量达20％，而且改进了产品质量。
    社会主义国家在培养技术干部工作中也进行合作。仅在苏联高等学校中，就有来自各社会主义国家的约一万四千名大学生和研究生。
    在1955年到1957年间，社会主义国家在保证每个国家的利益和社会主义大家庭各国的共同利益的前提下，在互相配合发展国民经济的年度和远景计划方面做了大量的工作。在社会主义国家国民经济主要部门的专业化和协作方面，也进行了重大的工作。
    由于社会主义国家生产的专业化和协作的发展，可以有计划地利用每一国家的最有利的自然条件和经济条件来生产某种产品，然后互相交换。
    由于生产的专业化和协作，可以减少产品项目，扩大生产规模，这就为采用大规模的流水作业法创造了条件，并对提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本、提高产品质量和生产的赢利性有促进作用。
    五年计划的配合，是社会主义国家多方面经济合作发展的新阶段。远景计划的配合和长期贸易协定，促进了生产专业化和协作的发展，并使社会主义的国际分工获得牢固的基础。
    发展计划的互相配合，在机器制造业的主要产品生产部门，黑色冶金和有色冶金部门，采煤、石油、煤气、化学工业和轻工业，以及农业的主要部门，已经实行。这种配合就是使最重要的产品生产水平取得一致，确定机器、车床和设备的类型，并在各国间分配生产，避免不必要的重复。同时在互相提供主要的机器、车床、设备、原料、燃料和粮食方面也实行协作。
    实行生产的专业化和协作，可以在重要生产部门确定一致的技术政策。
    国民经济远景计划的配合，可以发现个别社会主义国家国民经济发展中的薄弱环节，并可以采取措施加以消除。例如，在研究了发展黑色冶金业的原料基地问题以后，苏联将大大扩大铁矿的开采和向社会主义各国的供应数量。
    社会主义国家发展农业的远景计划的配合，是为了大大扩大农产品的生产，特别是扩大谷物的生产，广泛播种玉蜀黍，扩大化学肥料工业和生产现代化的农业机器。
    社会主义国家生产的专业化和协作，以及日益发展的社会主义国际分工，是同每个国家经济的综合发展同时进行的，强调指出这一点很重要。因此，社会主义的国际分工有助于社会主义国家国民经济的协调发展，并且在全面的兄弟般互助的基础上，促使它们的国民经济发展水平日益接近。
    目前社会主义各国的国家计划机关、各个部门、各科学研究机关以及经济互助委员会，正紧张地拟定十年到十五年的协作远景计划。
    兄弟般的互助是社会主义国家关系中不可分割的一部分。这种互助对于在很短的历史时期内，在经济方面，即在按人口计算的产品生产方面赶上和超过先进的资本主义国家来说，是一个巨大的推动力。
