The county of Gutian in Fujian Province has an Auspicious Temple, in front of which stands a stone pagoda. It is said that this stone pagoda was built in the fourth year of the Taiping Xingguo reign of the Song Dynasty (979 AD), and was renovated once during the Chenghua reign of the Ming Dynasty. In 1935, the monks of the temple, due to the excessive collapse of the stone pagoda, raised funds for repairs, replacing a stone slab on the pagoda base, while all other stone carvings are original.

The pagoda has an octagonal body, nine solid stories, and a total height of approximately twenty-five meters. It is an important ancient architectural relic and work of sculptural art. The eight sides of the pagoda base are decorated with bas-reliefs of dragons, horses, lions, sheep, turtles, cranes, and flowers. The first story of the pagoda body has eight niches on eight sides, each containing a seated Buddha statue about 0.20 meters high. On either side of the niches are bas-reliefs of figures, all extremely vivid and exquisite. The second to ninth stories each have niches and Buddha statues on each side, but the carvings outside the niches gradually decrease with each story, and the patterns also become simpler with each story.

In 1956, Gutian County expanded its hydroelectric power plant, and the Auspicious Stone Pagoda was located within the reservoir area. The Provincial Cultural Relics Management Committee conducted a survey in November of that year and plans to relocate the pagoda and rebuild it according to its original appearance.

    吉祥石塔
    福建省古田县有一个吉祥寺，寺前有石塔一座。据说这座石塔建于宋太平兴国四年（公元979），明成化间重修过一次。1935年，寺僧因石塔崩裂过甚，曾经募资重修，塔座上换了一块石板，其他石刻都是原物。
    塔身八角形，九层实心，全高约二十五公尺，是古代重要的建筑遗物和雕刻艺术品。塔座八面都有龙、马、狮、羊、龟、鹤、花朵等浮雕。塔身第一层八面有八个龛，龛内各有一尊约0.20公尺坐佛像。龛外两旁各有人物浮雕，均极生动精美。第二至第九层各面都有龛和佛像，只是龛外的雕刻逐层减少，花纹也逐层简单。
    1956年古田县扩建水力发电厂，吉祥石塔在水库区范围内，省文物管理委员会已于当年11月间进行了调查，准备将塔迁移，按原貌重建。
