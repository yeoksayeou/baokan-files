    Striving for New Heights with All Our Might
    ——Hong'an Jiansu Agricultural Cooperative Strives for a Bumper Peanut Harvest
    By our reporter Fang Di
    Hong'an County, Hubei Province, is known for its top-notch peanut production in the country, and the Jiansu Agricultural Cooperative is a model cooperative for extra-high yields in Hong'an County. This year, the cooperative decided to maintain and carry forward its glory, aiming to elevate peanut production to new heights. Their leap forward target is: to achieve an average yield of 1,100 jin per mu for all 948 mu of peanut fields in the cooperative, an increase of more than 77% compared to last year, and to create a number of high-yield models with yields of 1,500 jin per mu or more; the total peanut production will be doubled compared to last year.

    To achieve such high peanut yields on such a large area of land is indeed a difficult task. However, the cadres and members of the Jiansu Cooperative are determined to be heroes who overcome difficulties. This is their slogan: "With everyone united, barren land turns into gold; no matter how great the difficulties, as long as there is determination." For months, people have been fighting for a bumper harvest in this spirit.

    Some Figures
    Walking into the Jiansu Cooperative, one can see that the various tasks related to peanut yield are indeed being done well. Here are a few figures: This year, all peanut fields have been applied with sufficient base fertilizer, with an average application of 250 dan per mu, an increase of four times compared to last year, and the area of base fertilizer application has increased by nearly one time compared to last year; all peanut winter fallow land has been ploughed three to four times this spring in addition to winter ploughing, with a general deep ploughing depth of five to seven inches, one to two more times than last year, and the depth has increased by about two to three inches; all 350 mu of peanut winter fallow land in the cooperative have been improved by means of soil cultivation and mud cultivation, with 1,000 to 1,600 dan per mu, while only 152 mu of winter fallow land was cultivated with soil and mud last year, with only 200 to 300 dan per mu; in terms of close planting, according to the different conditions of barren land, medium land, and fertile land, 4,000 seedlings, 6,000 seedlings, 8,000 seedlings, and 10,000 seedlings were planted last year respectively, and this year it has been increased to 6,000 seedlings, 8,000 seedlings, 10,000 seedlings, and 12,000 seedlings, and the purity of seeds used for sowing has been further improved compared to last year; in addition, in order to solve the contradiction between peanut and barley/wheat intercropping in the two-crop rotation of grain and wheat, about half of the wheat-field peanuts in the cooperative have adopted the new method of transplanting after seedling raising with "peanut nutrient pots," which was not used at all last year.

    What do these figures show? They show that this agricultural cooperative has prominently grasped the key measures to promote peanut yield increase and is resolutely implementing them.

    Confident and Enthusiastic
    The peanut yield increase plan and the measures to realize the plan of the Jiansu Cooperative this year were affirmed only after being proposed and repeatedly debated by cadres and members, thus making the plan and measures both advanced and practical. Take the measure of applying sufficient base fertilizer as an example! For many years, it has not been customary to apply base fertilizer to peanuts here, and the prevailing saying is: "Peanuts cannot be applied with base fertilizer, applying base fertilizer will cause empty shells." However, the Wu Fanggang production team of this cooperative made a comparative experiment on 1.5 mu of peanut fields with the same soil quality two years ago: half a mu was not applied with base fertilizer, half a mu was applied with more than 20 dan of base fertilizer, and half a mu was mixed with 10 jin of superphosphate in more than 20 dan of base fertilizer; as a result, the half mu without base fertilizer produced 307 jin of peanuts, the half mu with base fertilizer but without superphosphate produced 334 jin of peanuts, and the half mu with base fertilizer and superphosphate produced 373 jin of peanuts. This experiment convinced many people that applying base fertilizer to peanuts can increase yield, so the area of base fertilizer application reached more than 500 mu last year. The amount applied per mu was generally 40 to 60 dan, and a very small amount of land was applied with 160 dan. What was the result? Last year, a part of the land in this cooperative achieved a peanut yield of more than 1,000 jin per mu, and these high-yield lands were all applied with base fertilizer; among them, the eight mu applied with 160 dan of base fertilizer achieved a yield of 1,256 jin per mu. Three months ago, when the cooperative discussed the plan and measures, some people initially did not fully understand the role of base fertilizer, but when the above facts were presented, everyone quickly reached a consensus and decided to take applying 200 to 300 dan of base fertilizer per mu as an important measure, and determined that the principle of application is: apply more to barren land and less to fertile land; phosphate fertilizer must be mixed with every mu.

    Similarly, the various measures mentioned above and implemented were affirmed only after a great debate. In this way, people are "clear about the numbers" for yield increase, and their confidence and determination have been greatly strengthened. According to the requirements of the leap forward plan, the "three guarantees and four to the fields" were implemented, making the plan and measures specific to the team and to the land; on the basis of doing a good job in quota remuneration, the "year-round responsibility and segmented contracting" household management responsibility system was implemented, helping each household to formulate a "knowing the income for the year in advance" form. In this way, the plan took root among the masses, the measures were mastered by the broad masses, and there were clear goals from top to bottom. In addition, the cooperative and team cadres generally planted experimental fields and actively took the lead in participating in labor, so a struggle to strive to achieve the plan quickly unfolded throughout the cooperative.

    Intense Labor to Strive for a Bumper Harvest
    In recent months, the enthusiasm of the masses in the Jiansu Cooperative has been unprecedented. Not only has the labor attendance rate of the entire cooperative often reached 100%, but also many elderly people who cannot be considered labor force or children who cannot be considered labor force have actively and voluntarily participated in production. Cooperative member Wang Shihe did a total of 3,140 work points last year, and this year even his 12-year-old daughter is participating in labor, planning to do 4,450 work points. According to his family's "knowing the income for the year in advance," including sideline production, the family's income will increase by one and a half times compared to last year. In order to turn this "knowing in advance" into reality, his family often locks the door and goes to the fields, and has now done nearly 2,000 work points. Some time ago, a girl in the cooperative got married. According to the usual custom, relatives, friends, and neighbors would always go to have a big party; but this time, in order not to delay production, people went to drink a cup of tea and then rushed to the fields. Not only is the labor attendance rate high, but also the labor efficiency has increased rapidly. Like soil improvement, the original plan was to complete it in half a month (including improving the soil of winter fallow fields), but it was completed in seven days. The more than 900 mu of peanuts in the entire cooperative were sown in only three days, with good sowing quality. At present, cadres and members are actively preparing to welcome cotton field sowing and rice transplanting. People are full of confidence to strive for a double harvest of rice and peanuts.

    鼓足干劲迈向新高峰
    ——红安建苏农业社争取花生大丰产
    本报记者　方堤
    湖北省红安县的花生高产在全国是数第一的，而建苏农业社又是红安县的特等丰产模范社。今年，这个社决定保持和发扬光荣，要使花生生产登上新的高峰。他们的跃进指标是：全社的九百四十八亩花生达到平均亩产一千一百斤，比去年增产77％强，并且还要创造一批亩产一千五百斤以上的高产典型；花生总产量比去年增加一倍。
    要在这样大面积的土地上创造出这样高的花生产量，的确是一件很难的事。但建苏社的干部和社员们决心要作战胜困难的英雄汉。这就是他们的口号：“众人一条心，黄土变成金；不怕困难大，只要有决心。”几个月来，人们正是用这种精神为争取丰产而斗争的。
    几个数字
    走进建苏社就能够看到这里有关花生丰产的各项工作实在作得好。这里且看几个数字：今年，全部花生地都施用了充足的底肥，每亩平均施用量是二百五十担，比去年增加了四倍，施底肥的面积比去年增加将近一倍；全部花生冬闲地除冬耕外，今春又普遍翻耕了三次到四次，一般深耕达五寸到七寸，比去年多耕一次到二次，深度增加了二、三寸左右；全社的三百五十亩花生冬闲地都用培土、培泥的方法改良了土壤，每亩培了一千担到一千六百担，而去年进行培土、培泥的冬闲地只一百五十二亩，每亩只培了二百担到三百担；在密植方面，根据瘦地、中等地、肥地的不同情况，去年分别播种四千蔸、六千蔸、八千蔸、一万蔸，今年已提高到六千蔸、八千蔸、一万蔸、一万二千蔸，而且播用种子的纯度较去年又有提高；此外，为了解决花生和大麦、小麦套种中存在的生、麦两熟的矛盾，全社有大约一半的麦林花生采用了“花生营养钵”育苗后移栽的新办法，而这在去年是根本没有采用过的。
    这些数字表明了什么呢？它们表明：这个农业社突出地抓住了促进花生增产的关键性的措施，而且在坚决地贯彻。
    心中有数干劲十足
    建苏社今年花生增产的规划和实现规划的措施，都是经干部和社员提出并反复辩论后才肯定下来的，因此使规划、措施既先进、又实际。就拿施足底肥这一措施来说吧！许多年来，这里对花生施底肥是不习惯的，流行的说法是：“花生不能施底肥，施了底肥长气颗（空壳）。”可是在前年，这个社的五房岗生产队在一亩半土质相同的花生地里作了个对比试验：把其中半亩不施底肥，半亩施底肥二十多担，还有半亩在施二十多担底肥中拌了过磷酸钙十斤；结果未施底肥的半亩产花生三百零七斤，施底肥但未拌过磷酸钙的半亩产花生三百三十四斤，施底肥又拌了过磷酸钙的半亩产花生三百七十三斤。这个试验使许多人相信了花生施底肥可以增产，所以在去年施底肥的面积达到五百多亩。每亩施用量一般是四十担到六十担，也有极少量的地施用到一百六十担。结果怎样呢？去年这个社有一部分地亩产花生达到了一千斤以上，而这些高产地都是施了底肥的；其中施底肥达一百六十担的八亩，亩产量达到一千二百五十六斤。三个月前，社里讨论规划和措施时，开初还有些人对施底肥的作用认识不足，可是当上述事实被摆出后，大家很快就认识一致了，决定把每亩施底肥二百到三百担作为一项重要措施，并确定施用的原则是：瘦地多施，肥地稍少；亩亩都要拌用磷肥。
    同样，前面已经提到并且得到了贯彻的各项措施，也都是经过大辩论后才被肯定下来的。这样，人们对增产“心中有数”，信心和决心就大大加强。根据跃进规划的要求，实行了“三包、四到田”，使规划、措施具体到队，到地；还在作好定额计酬的基础上实行了“长年包责任，分段包工”的分户管理责任制，帮助各户订出了“一年收益早知道”的表格。这样，就使得规划在群众中生了根，措施为广大群众所掌握，从上到下都有明确的目标。再加上社、队干部普遍种了试验地，积极带头参加劳动，于是，一个力争实现规划的斗争很快就在全社展开了。
    紧张劳动争取丰收
    几个月来，建苏社群众劳动热情高涨的情况是前所未有的。全社劳动出勤率不仅经常达到100％，而且许多不能算劳动力的老人或还不能算劳动力的小孩，也都积极主动地参加了生产。社员王世和，去年全家共做三千一百四十个工分，今年连十二岁的女儿也参加劳动，计划作四千四百五十个工分。根据他家的“一年收益早知道”，连同副业生产在内，全家收入将比去年增加一倍半。为了把这个“早知道”变成现实，他家经常锁门下地，现在已经做了将近二千个工分。前些时，社里有个姑娘出嫁，如按通常的习惯，亲友、邻居们总是要去玩上一大阵的；可是这次，为了不耽误生产，人们去喝了杯茶就忙着下地了。不仅劳动出勤率高，劳动效率也提高得很快。像改良土壤，原计划是半个月完成（包括改良冬闲田的土壤），结果七天就全部完成了。全社九百多亩花生只用了三天时间，播种质量很好。目前，干部和社员们正积极准备迎接棉田播种和水稻插秧。人们满怀信心地要争取水稻、花生双丰收。
