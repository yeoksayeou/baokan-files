A great singer and warrior, may you stay forever young!
Qian Junrui

Dear Paul Robeson, we respect you, and the working people of the whole world respect you. You are a good son of the American working people. Your father was once a slave, and you yourself were once a farm laborer, dockworker, and servant. You have personally experienced the exploitation, oppression, discrimination, and humiliation of the slave owners. But you are faithful to the cause of the working people, and you have achieved a state where wealth cannot corrupt you, poverty cannot sway you, and power cannot subdue you. Your slogan is "I want to live and work among the broader masses." You are closely connected with our most ordinary people, workers and peasants. We especially respect you, first and foremost out of a class instinct.

Paul Robeson, our dear friend, we love you from the bottom of our hearts. The people of the whole world love you like this. You are the great singer of our great era. Your singing voice is like a great bell, like thunder, filled with the pursuit of truth and the desire for freedom, filled with the people's beautiful and far-reaching ideals. It attracts and touches every kind heart. You sing of the people, sing of labor, sing of the struggle for peace and freedom. Your singing voice propels people to move forward bravely. This singing voice, oh, is more powerful than hundreds and thousands of atomic bombs, shaking the foundations of the entire Western world.

Paul Robeson, our great contemporary warrior, we admire you and firmly support you. Progressive people all over the world also admire you and support you. Just as you yourself firmly believe, you are by no means isolated. Your labor, your struggle, has won the hearts of hundreds of millions of people around the world. Your thoughts embrace the whole world, and the whole world also embraces you tightly, our own person, dear Paul Robeson. All true Americans, true Englishmen, true Frenchmen and Italians, all the people of our socialist camp, and all conscientious people in every corner of the world, whether they know you or not, are missing you and longing to hear your voice. In today's world, it is not you who are isolated, dear Robeson, but a small group of vermin and rodents—the instigators of aggression and the peddlers of war. People still remember that when the dawn of peace first appeared in 1945, American newspapers once juxtaposed Paul Robeson with the current American president, then-American General Eisenhower, calling them "two great Americans." Thirteen years have passed, and now it seems that in America, as a famous American said, Paul Robeson is "the tallest tree in our forest" (Mary McLeod Bethune). As for the copyright holder of the Eisenhower Doctrine, at least until today, history has proven that he is only worthy of people's contempt, ridicule, and hatred.

Today we are happy to celebrate your sixtieth birthday, dear Robeson. We celebrate you with the warmest hearts and the happiest spirits. What an extraordinary sixty years! As far as you personally are concerned, you have become a giant of the world's working people striving for freedom and peace from being the child of a slave. As for this world, then in these sixty years, capitalism has developed from its rotten maturity to increasingly approaching its complete demise, and a bright and splendid new socialist system has grown from its great birth into a powerful and invincible world system. The East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and mankind has begun to move from winter into spring. This is you, dear Robeson, the entire historical background of your sixty years of experience.

Today, the fifteen million Black people in America and the working people of America are warmly celebrating your sixtieth birthday because you have waged tireless struggles for their freedom for decades. Listen, listen to the magnificent singing of "Ballad for Americans" that you created and led in singing in 1939:

	"The white man shall not be free
	While his black brother is in slavery,
	Our country's strong, our country's young,
	And her greatest songs are still unsung..." This America, as you yourself explained, is definitely "not the America of evil forces" but "the America of the people's freedom and peace defenders."

Today, the working people of Britain will also warmly celebrate your birthday. For thirty years, your thoughts have been closely linked to the development of the British working class's socialist thought, and you have gained a clearer understanding of the hideous face of colonialism from Britain. Your singing voice, your performances (especially your performance as Shakespeare's Othello) touched the hearts of every ordinary person in England and Ireland. They love you madly, and they say that the driving force of your singing voice is not an ordinary singing throat, but a sincere soul of justice.

Today, the people of Spain will also celebrate you with special excitement and gratitude, revered Robeson, because in the years of the 1930s when the Spanish people rose up to oppose Franco's fascist tyranny, you fought side by side with them, in the trenches, in the armory in Madrid, you sang for them day and night, encouraging them to move forward. You yourself once said that Spain was a constant battle concert for you.

Today, the people of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, Italy, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Egypt, Ethiopia, and all the countries you have been to and not been to who love peace will warmly congratulate you.

You have an extraordinarily deep friendship with the Chinese people. You have been concerned about the Chinese people's liberation struggle for a long time. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, you supported us in resisting the Japanese aggressors in London with your singing. The birth of New China gave you infinite joy and further strengthened your confidence in the oppressed nations' struggle for liberation. You once told American youth, "The Chinese people have forever freed themselves from the life of being bullied and creating profits for foreign imperialism and are going to turn their country and the entire Far East into a land of freedom, dignity, and security." Although you have never been to China, you have studied Chinese and learned many Chinese songs, the one you love to sing the most being our national anthem today—the March of the Volunteers.

We first met in Prague in 1949. Afterwards, we met several times in Warsaw and Moscow. I strongly felt that you were a close friend of the Chinese people. It really cannot but amaze me how profound your understanding of the Chinese people is. In talking with me, you frankly placed all the hopes for the future of mankind on the Soviet Union and China, and at that time our motherland had not yet been completely liberated. You said that only in the Soviet Union and People's China can there be a truly human life, and can there be the happiness of all the people. You firmly believe that socialism is the only correct path to save mankind. You long to come to China. You said to me: "My heart is like a bird, it has already flown to China. I have a bellyful of words to say to the Chinese people. I want to sing for the great hard-working Chinese people day and night, and sing in Chinese. I have learned too few Chinese songs, I must work harder to learn a few more. The victory of the Chinese people has brought so much strength to the Black people, to the Africans, and to the Asians!" At that time you promised our request, saying "I will definitely come next year, first to the Philippines, then to China." But in 1950, the US State Department, in order to prove American-style "democracy" and "freedom" to the world, arrogantly cancelled your passport to travel abroad. Therefore, until now, your hope of coming to China and the Chinese people's eager desire to see the demeanor of this close friend have not been realized.

However, only despicable fools can imagine shutting up your singing voice. The Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the people of all countries around the world can still hear your thunder-like singing voice. This is the battle song of our era. It resounds throughout heaven and earth, embodies the direction of human history's progress, and no one can stop it. McCarthyism's persecution, the Ku Klux Klan's sabotage, and Dulles's unreasonable obstruction cannot stop Robeson's majestic singing voice from spreading to the ends of the earth, continuing and even more greatly exerting its power to inspire people and push history forward.

Nearly a century ago, Paul Robeson's brilliant pioneer poet Walt Whitman sang:

	"I hear you whispering there O you,
	O you of fierce light, strong throbbing heart,……
	O strong deliveress, O moral power!
	I hear you whispering and chanting, I hear you
	saying that shall be endlessness,……"

This resolute and strong voice, it seems, belongs to you, Paul Robeson.

Today, we congratulate you from the far East, from Beijing, dear friend, we wish you boundless longevity, as evergreen as pine and cypress. Let us shake hands tightly, Chinese people and true Americans, for the happiness of mankind, for the lasting peace of the world! (Attached picture)

    伟大的歌手和战士，祝你长青！
    钱俊瑞
    亲爱的保罗·罗伯逊，我们尊敬你，全世界的劳动人民都尊敬你。你是美国劳动人民的好儿子。你的父亲曾经是奴隶，你自己曾经当过农场的雇工、码头工人和仆役。你身受过奴隶主们的种种剥削、压迫、歧视和凌辱。但是你忠实于劳动人民的事业，做到富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈。你的口号是“我要在更广大的群众中去生活，去工作。”你是同我们最普通的人们，工人和农民，血肉相联的人。我们特别尊敬你，首先出于一种阶级的本能。
    保罗·罗伯逊，我们亲爱的朋友，我们从心底里热爱你。全世界的人民都这样热爱你。你是我们这个伟大时代的伟大歌手。你的歌声像洪钟，像雷鸣，它充满着对真理的追求和对自由的渴望，充满着人民的美好而远大的理想。它吸引住并且打动着每一颗善良的心。你歌唱人民，歌唱劳动，歌唱着为和平与自由的斗争。你的歌声推动着人们奋勇前进。这歌声哟，赛过几百颗几千颗原子弹，震撼着整个西方世界的根基。
    保罗·罗伯逊，我们同时代的伟大战士，我们敬佩你，并且坚决支持你。全世界的进步人类也都敬佩你，支持你。正如你自己深信的那样，你决不是孤立的。你的劳动，你的奋斗，赢得了全世界亿万人的心。你的思想拥抱着全世界，全世界也紧紧地拥抱着你，我们的自己人，亲爱的保罗·罗伯逊。凡是真正的美国人，真正的英国人，真正的法国人和意大利人，我们社会主义阵营各国的全体人民，以及世界各个角落的一切有良心的人，不论认识你的，或者不认识你的，都在怀念你，渴望着听到你的声音。在今天的世界上孤立的决不是你，亲爱的罗伯逊，而是一小撮虫豸和耗子——侵略头子和战争贩子们。人们还记得，当1945年和平曙光初现的时候，美国报纸曾经把保罗·罗伯逊和当今的美国总统，当年的美国将军艾森豪威尔并列，称他们为“两个伟大的美国人”。十三年过去了，现在看来，在美国，正像一位有名的美国人所说的，保罗·罗伯逊才是“我们森林里最高的一个树。”（曼丽·麦克里奥·白休恩）。至于那位艾森豪威尔主义的版权人，至少到今天为止，却被历史证明了只值得人们渺视、奚落和憎恨。
    今天我们欣逢你的六十诞辰，亲爱的罗伯逊。我们用最热烈的心肠和最高兴的心情来庆贺你。多么不平凡的六十年哟！就你个人讲，你以一个奴隶的孩子成为世界劳动人民争取自由与和平的巨人。至于这个世界，那么就在这六十年里，资本主义已经从它的烂熟发展到日益接近于它的整个灭亡，而一个光明灿烂的崭新的社会主义制度却已经从它伟大的诞生，成长为强大无敌的世界体系。东风已经压倒西风，人类已经开始从冬天走进春天。这就是你，亲爱的罗伯逊，你的六十年经历的全部时代背景。
    今天，美国的一千五百万黑人和美国的劳动人民在热烈地庆祝你的六十大寿，因为你几十年来曾经为着他们的自由进行不疲倦的斗争。听吧，听着你在1939年所创作和领唱的“美国人民叙事曲”的雄壮歌声：
    “白皮肤的人决不能得到自由
      当他的黑人兄弟们陷在奴隶境遇里的时光，
      我们的国家很强，又很年青，
      她的最伟大的歌曲还没有被
      歌唱……”这个美国，正像你自己所解释的，决“不是罪恶势力的美国”，而是“人民的自由和平的保卫者的美国。”
    今天，英国的劳动人民也会十分热烈地庆祝你的寿辰。三十年来，你的思想同英国工人阶级社会主义思想的发展有着密切的联系，你从英国身上更加认清殖民主义的面目狰狞。你的歌声，你的演出（特别是你演出莎士比亚的奥赛罗）打动了英格兰和爱尔兰的每一个普通人们的心。他们狂热地爱你，他们说你的歌声的动力不是什么普通的歌喉，而是一个诚挚的正义的灵魂。
    今天，西班牙的人民也将会以特别兴奋和感激的心情来祝贺你，敬爱的罗伯逊，因为在三十年代西班牙人民奋起反对佛朗哥法西斯暴政的岁月里，你曾和他们并肩作战，在战壕里，在马德里的兵工厂里，你曾白天黑夜为他们歌唱，鼓舞他们前进。你自己曾说，西班牙对于你乃是一个不断的战斗音乐会。
    今天，苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、法国、意大利、瑞典、挪威、芬兰、埃及、埃塞俄比亚以及一切你所到过和没有到过的国家里的爱好和平的人们都会热情地祝贺你。
    你对中国人民怀着分外深厚的友情。你很早就关心中国人民的解放斗争。在抗日战争以前，你曾在伦敦用你的歌唱支援我们反抗日本侵略者。新中国的诞生给你以无限的喜悦，也更加增强了你对被压迫民族争取解放的信心。你曾对美国青年们说，“中国人民已经永远摆脱了受人欺凌的为外国帝国主义创造利润的生活，而要把他们的国家和整个远东变成自由、尊严与安全的国土。”你虽然没有到过中国，但是你学习了中国文，学会了许多中国歌曲，其中最爱唱的就是我们今天的国歌——义勇军进行曲。
    1949年我们在布拉格初次见了面。往后又在华沙和莫斯科见了几次面。我强烈地感到你是中国人民的一位知心朋友。你对中国人民有那么深刻的了解，实在不能不使我惊异。你在和我谈话时曾经坦率地把人类前途的全部希望寄托在苏联和中国，而那时我们的祖国还没有得到全部解放。你说，只有在苏联、和人民中国，才能有真正的称得上人的生活，才能有全体人民的幸福。你深信社会主义是拯救人类的唯一正确的道路。你渴望来到中国。你对我说：“我的心好比一只飞鸟，早已飞到了中国。我有满腔的话要向中国人民讲。我要为伟大的勤劳的中国人民夜以继日地歌唱，而且用中国话歌唱。我学的中国歌还少，还要加劲多学几个。中国人民的胜利给黑人们，给非洲人和亚洲人带来了多么大的力量哟！”当时你答应我们的要求，说“明年一定来，先到菲律宾，然后去中国。”但到1950年，美国国务院为了向全世界证实美国式的“民主”和“自由”，竟横蛮地取消了你的出国护照。因此，直到现在，你到中国来的希望和中国人民迫切要求一见这位知友的丰采的希望都还没有实现。
    但是，只有卑劣的蠢才们才能设想把你的歌声关住。中国人民、苏联人民和全世界各国的人民现在照样都能听到你春雷般的歌声。这是我们时代的战歌。它响彻天地，体现着人类历史前进的方向，谁都不能阻挡。麦卡锡主义的迫害，三K党的捣乱，杜勒斯们的无理阻挠，都阻止不了罗伯逊的雄伟歌声，传遍天涯海角，继续而且更大地发挥它鼓舞人心，推动历史前进的力量。
    差不多在一世纪前，保罗·罗伯逊的光辉的先驱者诗人惠特曼就唱道：
    “我耳听你高声吼鸣，你的高
    昂的声音响震大陆，……
    强壮的年代哟，
    听见你一再发出坚决的声音，……”
    这坚决和强壮的声音，看来就是属于你，保罗·罗伯逊。
    今天，我们从遥远的东方，从北京，祝贺你，亲爱的朋友，祝贺你万寿无疆，像松柏一样长青。让我们紧紧地握手，中国人和真正的美国人，为了人类的幸福，为了世界的持久和平！（附图片）
