Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan: The Yudao River Irrigation Area in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, uses water rationally, with one flow (Editor's note: One flow is one cubic meter per second, that is, one cubic meter of water flowing per second.) irrigating 100,000 mu of land. This is three to five times more land than is irrigated with the same amount of water in ordinary clear water irrigation areas in Shanxi Province, setting a new provincial record for the area irrigated annually by one flow. Recently, the provincial water conservancy department sent people to summarize their experience, and it will be promoted throughout the province.

The Yudao River Irrigation Area is a small irrigation area with a clear water flow of only about 0.2 cubic meters per second. The main reason this irrigation area can irrigate so much land is that it rationally arranges water use according to the water demand season of crops, solving the contradiction of simultaneous water use by various crops. For example, when it rains, water is diverted to high-lying and sandy soil耕地 for irrigation, or stored in reservoirs and ponds for use during peak water demand; during crop maturity and harvest, furrow irrigation is carried out while harvesting; according to the soil water retention capacity, land is irrigated in categories and sequences. The irrigation area also implements a timed, fixed-area, and fixed-water-volume irrigation system, implementing a method of irrigating land day and night throughout the year to avoid waste of water.

In Shanxi Province, most clear water irrigation areas currently irrigate only 30,000 mu of land per flow per year. Whether this can be expanded has been a matter of debate among cadres in various irrigation areas. The Yudao River Irrigation Area irrigating 100,000 mu of land per flow provides an advanced model for resolving the debate and expanding irrigation capacity.

    一个流量浇地十万亩
    山西推广峪道河灌区合理用水经验
    新华社太原电　山西汾阳县峪道河灌区用水合理，一个流量（编者注：一个流量就是一个秒公方，也就是每秒钟流过一立方公尺的水。）折合浇地十万亩，比山西省一般清水灌区同等数量的水多浇地三倍到五倍，创造了全省一个流量全年灌溉面积的新纪录。最近，省水利部门派人前往总结经验，要在全省范围内推广。
    峪道河灌区是个仅有清水流量约零点二秒公方的小灌区。这个灌区能够浇到这样多的地，主要是根据作物需水季节合理安排用水，解决了各种作物同时用水的矛盾。例如，下雨的时候把水引到高地和沙土性质的耕地进行灌溉，或者储到蓄水池塘里，准备水忙时使用；在庄稼成熟和收割时，实行了边收割、边沟灌；根据土壤保水能力，分类按次序进行浇地。这个灌区还贯彻执行了定时、定面积、定水量的灌溉制度，实行一年四季日夜不停地浇地办法，避免用水上的浪费。
    山西省大部分清水灌区现在一个流量全年只浇三万多亩地，能不能再扩大，各灌区干部对这个问题有争论。峪道河灌区折合一个流量浇到十万亩地，给解决争论并且扩大灌溉能力创造了先进的典范。
