    Regardless of the Consequences
    Philippine President Garcia, in an interview with the Associated Press, stated that he agreed to establish American nuclear missile bases in the Philippines. To demonstrate his determination, Garcia even told the American reporter that if such bases were established, the Philippines was prepared and willing to face the anger of the communists.
    Garcia's concern about the anger of the communists while engaging in this act of playing with fire is not without reason. The communists firmly oppose the nuclear arms race policy of the United States and followers like Garcia. Moreover, the communists' firm will to oppose nuclear arms race has been responded to and supported by peace-loving people all over the world. How could Garcia and his ilk not feel worried about this.
    However, despite his concerns, Garcia patted his chest to the United States and demanded missile bases. What exactly was this for? Let's hear his own confession. Garcia stated in the same interview: "I hope to receive (America's) sufficient economic aid." It turns out that this Philippine president was so impassioned merely to exchange it for a few dollars. This is truly wanting dollars regardless of the consequences.

    不顾后果
    菲律宾总统加西亚在对美国合众社记者发表谈话时表示，他同意在菲律宾建立美国核导弹基地。为了表明他的决心，加西亚甚至对那位美国记者说，如果这种基地建立的话，菲律宾准备而且愿意面对共产党人的愤怒。
    加西亚在干这种玩火烧身的勾当的时候担心共产党人的愤怒，不是没有道理的。共产党人坚决反对美国和追随美国的加西亚之流的核备战政策。而且，共产党人反对核备战的坚决的意志得到了全世界爱好和平人民的响应和支持。加西亚之流对此焉能不感到担心。
    可是，尽管担心，加西亚还是向美国拍了胸脯要求导弹基地，这究竟是为了什么呢？且听他自己的供状吧。加西亚在同一个谈话中表示：“我希望得到（美国的）足够的经济援助”。原来，这位菲律宾总统所以那样慷慨激昂，不过为了换取几个美元。这真是只要美元而不顾后果了。
