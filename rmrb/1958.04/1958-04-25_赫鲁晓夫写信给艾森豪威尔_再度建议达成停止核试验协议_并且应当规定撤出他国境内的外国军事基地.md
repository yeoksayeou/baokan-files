Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 23rd: TASS reported that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, wrote to U.S. President Eisenhower, recommending that both sides end the dispute over the issue of banning nuclear weapon tests and reach an agreement on the United States and the United Kingdom, like the Soviet Union, ceasing the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Khrushchev's letter has been delivered to the U.S. State Department on the 22nd by the Soviet Ambassador to the United States. It is a response to a letter from the U.S. President to the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers on April 8th.

Khrushchev pointed out in the letter that Eisenhower said in his letter that the Soviet Union decided to unilaterally stop atomic and hydrogen weapon tests after conducting a series of tests. Khrushchev replied that the United States has conducted far more nuclear weapon tests than the Soviet Union. Did the United States not have the opportunity to stop continuing the tests after any one of these tests?

Khrushchev answered Eisenhower's question about the possibility of conducting certain types of tests in secret and unsupervised conditions. He said that it is known that there are now instruments, equipment, and methods of detection that can record any explosion of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Khrushchev stressed in the letter that, considering the experience of years of virtually fruitless negotiations on disarmament, he cannot agree with Eisenhower's view that the cessation of nuclear weapon tests must be part of a broad disarmament agreement.

Khrushchev wrote, what gains will we have in the future if we continue to test increasingly powerful destructive weapons while conducting disarmament negotiations?

Khrushchev responded to the suggestions mentioned by the U.S. President in his letter, such as "open skies," using outer space for peaceful purposes, and stopping the production of fissile materials for military purposes. He said that under the conditions that tension and distrust still exist between the United States and the Soviet Union, "open skies" may not make the people of the Soviet Union and the United States feel very safe. Aerial photography may deepen international tensions and be exploited by those forces seeking excuses to launch a devastating atomic war when someone is preparing for an atomic war.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union is willing to conclude an agreement on prohibiting the use of outer space for military purposes and on launching rockets into space in accordance with agreed international scientific research programs. However, we must not ignore the fact that atomic and hydrogen weapons can hit targets not only through intercontinental rockets, but also through medium- and short-range rockets and ordinary bomber fleets located at many U.S. military bases surrounding the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that this agreement should also stipulate the removal of foreign military bases in other countries, especially in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.

Khrushchev pointed out that such a solution is reasonable, fully in line with the interests of the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries, and will not give any country any advantage.

The Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers emphasized in the letter that, since raising the issue of the peaceful use of atomic energy, the Soviet government has consistently strived in the United Nations to prohibit the use, production, and stockpiling of all kinds of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and advocated the establishment of international supervision to monitor the implementation of these measures. However, Eisenhower did not put forward any proposals aimed at resolving the issue of disarmament and eliminating the threat of nuclear war in his letter of April 8th. Khrushchev concluded by saying that the current international situation requires all countries, especially major powers, to take concrete actions in disarmament. In the future, the Soviet Union will not explode another atomic bomb or another hydrogen bomb unless the United States and the United Kingdom force us to do so. The question of whether to end nuclear tests forever or continue conducting them depends on the United States and the United Kingdom.

    赫鲁晓夫写信给艾森豪威尔
    再度建议达成停止核试验协议
    并且应当规定撤出他国境内的外国军事基地
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科23日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫写信给美国总统艾森豪威尔，建议双方结束关于禁止核武器试验问题的争论，而就美国和英国也同苏联一样地停止试验原子武器和氢武器一事达成协议。
    赫鲁晓夫的这封信已经由苏联驻美国大使于22日递交给美国国务院。它是对美国总统4月8日给苏联部长会议主席的一封信的答复。
    赫鲁晓夫在信里指出，艾森豪威尔在他的来信中说，苏联是在进行了一系列试验之后才决定单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验的。赫鲁晓夫回答说，美国进行核武器试验的次数比苏联多得多，难道美国没有机会在任何一次这种试验之后停止继续试验吗？
    赫鲁晓夫回答了艾森豪威尔关于在秘密和无监督的条件下可能进行某些类型的试验的问题。他说，大家知道，现在有可以记录原子武器和氢武器任何爆炸的器械、仪器和发现的办法。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中着重指出，考虑到多年来就裁军问题所进行的实际上没有结果的谈判的经验，他不能够同意艾森豪威尔的观点：停止试验核武器必须是广泛裁军协议的一部分。
    赫鲁晓夫写道，如果在进行裁军谈判的同时将继续试验威力日益巨大的毁灭性武器的话，我们今后将会有什么收获呢？
    赫鲁晓夫回答了美国总统在他的信中提到的美国从前提过的关于“开放天空”、把宇宙空间用于和平目的和停止为军事目的生产裂变物质等建议。他说，在美苏两国之间还存在着紧张和不信任关系的条件下，“开放天空”未必会使苏美两国人民感到十分安全。当有人正在准备原子战争的情况下，进行空中摄影可能加深国际紧张局势，并且被那些企图寻找借口来发动毁灭性原子战争的势力所利用。
    赫鲁晓夫强调说，苏联愿意就禁止把宇宙空间用于军事目的和必须根据商定的国际科学研究计划向宇宙发射火箭一事缔结协定。但是，我们也不能忽视下面的事实，就是原子武器和氢武器不仅可以通过洲际火箭，而且也可以通过中、近程火箭以及位于苏联周围的很多美国军事基地上的普通轰炸机队而击中目标。因此，苏联认为，这个协定还应当规定撤除在他国境内，首先是在欧洲、中近东和北非的外国军事基地。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，这样解决问题是合理的，是完全符合美国、苏联和其他国家的利益的，并且不会使任何国家占任何便宜。
    苏联部长会议主席在信中特别着重指出，苏联政府从提出和平利用原子能的问题起，就始终一贯地在联合国中争取禁止使用、生产、储备各种原子武器和氢武器，并且主张建立国际监督来监督这些措施的实现。然而，艾森豪威尔在他4月8日的信中没有提出旨在解决裁军问题和消除核战争威胁的建议。赫鲁晓夫最后说，当前的国际局势要求一切国家，首先是大国，在裁军方面采取具体的行动。今后，苏联将不再爆炸一枚原子弹也不爆炸一枚氢弹，如果美国和英国不迫使我们这样做的话。是永远终止核试验呢，还是继续进行试验呢，这个问题将取决于美国和英国两个国家。
