Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: TASS reported that Khrushchev, in a reply letter to Suzuki, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party, said that the further development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, especially the signing of a peace treaty between the two countries, would help consolidate peace. The Soviet side is making the necessary efforts to develop and strengthen good-neighborly relations between our two countries. The Soviet government has expressed its willingness to resume negotiations with Japan on concluding a peace treaty at any time.

Khrushchev also said that we firmly believe that concluding a peace treaty in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration issued on October 19, 1956, will fully conform to the interests of the Soviet people and also to the interests of the Japanese people.

Some time ago, Suzuki sent Khrushchev a letter in his personal capacity. In his letter, he expressed the hope that Khrushchev would make greater efforts to ease international tensions and develop the idea of peaceful coexistence at this time of rapid development of the international situation. He advocated further strengthening friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan and accelerating the conclusion of a Soviet-Japanese peace treaty. Suzuki also expressed the hope that the fishery negotiations between the two countries could be successfully concluded.

Khrushchev continued in his reply letter that good-neighborly relations can only develop smoothly if both parties express sincerity and willingness to develop them. Unfortunately, the Japanese government has not yet made such an expression. This is primarily manifested in the fact that the Japanese government has not expressed its sincerity in concluding a peace treaty. It is precisely because the Japanese government has adopted such an intention that the issue you are concerned about, regarding Japanese fishermen fishing in certain areas of the Soviet territorial waters of the Kuril Islands, has not been able to be discussed.

It can be seen from this that the Japanese government's continued artificial obstruction of the conclusion of a peace treaty between our two countries has caused great material losses to the Japanese fishing industry.

Khrushchev said that as for the issue of fishing in the area stipulated by the Northwest Pacific Treaty, the Soviet side has not sought any benefits for itself, but has only insisted on complying with the section of the Soviet-Japanese Treaty of May 14, 1956, regarding the protection of marine resources and their rational utilization. If the Japanese delegation had adopted the same stance, the negotiations would have been successfully concluded long ago.

We hope that the Japanese Socialist Party will correctly understand the Soviet government's position on these issues, support the Soviet government's policy aimed at consolidating peace and relieving humanity of deep concerns about the fate of peace and the fate of future generations, and promote the further development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Japan.

When talking about the issue of peaceful coexistence, Khrushchev emphasized that we regard striving to safeguard peace between the peoples of all countries as the main task of Soviet foreign policy. The Soviet government is convinced that today, there is no other sensible policy besides the policy of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Based on this policy, the Soviet Union put forward a new and broad plan of action to consolidate peace at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and proposed convening a summit meeting. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also adopted a resolution on the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of testing all types of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

### 赫鲁晓夫写信给日本社会党领导人  希望发展苏日两国睦邻关系  指责日本政府继续制造人为障碍

    赫鲁晓夫写信给日本社会党领导人
    希望发展苏日两国睦邻关系
    指责日本政府继续制造人为障碍
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社报道，赫鲁晓夫在给日本社会党中央执行委员会委员长铃木的一封复信中说，苏日两国友好关系的进一步发展，首先是两国和约的签订会有助于巩固和平。苏联方面在做必要的努力，争取发展和巩固我们两国之间的睦邻关系。苏联政府表示，愿意在任何时候恢复同日本缔结和约的谈判。
    赫鲁晓夫又说，我们深信，按照1956年10月19日发表的苏日联合宣言规定的条件缔结和约，将完全符合苏联人民利益，也符合日本人民的利益。
    前些天铃木曾经以私人名义给赫鲁晓夫一封信。他在信中表示希望赫鲁晓夫在这国际局势迅速发展的时候，做更大的努力缓和国际紧张局势、发展和平共处的思想。他主张更进一步密切苏日两国的友好关系，和加速缔结苏日和约。铃木还表示希望两国的渔业谈判能够完满结束。
    赫鲁晓夫在复信中接着说，只有双方都表示发展睦邻关系的诚意和愿望，睦邻关系才能顺利地发展。遗憾的是，日本政府至今还没有这样的表示。这首先表现为，日本政府没有表示缔结和约的诚意。正是由于日本政府采取了这样的意愿，你们所关心的关于日本渔民在千岛群岛某些地区的苏联领水上捕鱼的问题才没有能够讨论下去。
    由此可见，日本政府继续人为地阻挠我们两国之间缔结和约就给日本渔业造成了很大的物质损失。
    赫鲁晓夫说，至于谈到在太平洋西北部条约规定地区捕鱼的问题，那么苏联方面没有为自己争取任何利益，而只是坚持遵守1956年5月14日的苏日条约中关于保护海产资源及其合理利用的部分。假如日本代表团也采取同样的立场，谈判早就完满地结束了。
    我们希望日本社会党正确地了解苏联政府在这些问题上的立场，支持苏联政府旨在巩固和平和解除人类对和平的命运、对后代命运的深切忧虑的政策，并且促使苏日两国的友好关系得到进一步发展。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到和平共处的问题时强调指出，我们把争取维护各国人民之间的和平看作苏联外交政策的主要任务。苏联政府确信，在今天，除了不同社会制度各国和平共处的政策以外，再也没有别的理智的政策。根据这种政策，苏联在去年底和今年初提出了新的、广泛的巩固和平行动计划，并且建议召开最高级会议。苏联最高苏维埃还通过了关于苏联单方面停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器的决议。
