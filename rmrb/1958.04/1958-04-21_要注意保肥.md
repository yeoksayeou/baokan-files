    Pay Attention to Preserving Fertilizer
    Accumulating fertilizer, like other tasks, requires achieving quantity, speed, and also quality and economy. However, some agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province only focus on accumulating fertilizer but neglect its preservation, carelessly pouring human and animal waste into manure pits without covers. Much high-quality local miscellaneous fertilizer is also casually piled up by hillsides and roadsides, exposed to the sun and rain, causing a significant loss of effective nutrients.
    According to analysis by agricultural research departments, human and animal waste, if not shaded or covered, loses over 40% of its fertilizer effectiveness within a month. Compost, stable manure, and local miscellaneous fertilizers, if not sealed with mud and left exposed to the sun and rain, can lose 30% to 60% of their effectiveness. Mixing manure with plant ash results in a loss of at least 50% of fertilizer effectiveness. However, many people do not realize this, only seeing the pile of fertilizer without noticing the loss of effectiveness. According to estimates by relevant departments, Guangdong Province lost over one billion dan of fertilizer annually in the past due to poor fertilizer preservation. If each mu requires 100 dan of fertilizer, this loss could have fertilized ten million mu. Some places in Guangdong are very attentive to fertilizer preservation. For example, the Liangbian Cooperative in Dongguan County achieved "three haves" throughout the cooperative within three days, changing the age-old unreasonable practice of sun-drying manure, which caused the greatest loss of fertilizer effectiveness, to composting manure. They also converted dry toilets to flush toilets, and all manure pits were covered, not only improving fertilizer accumulation and preservation but also improving environmental hygiene. If fertilizer preservation work can be universally improved nationwide, it will bring a significant amount of wealth to agricultural production.　Li Shaoqiu

### 要注意保肥

    要注意保肥
    积肥和其他工作一样，要做到多、快，也需要做到好、省。但是，广东省有些农业社只管积肥，却不注意保肥，把许多辛辛苦苦积来的人、畜粪尿随意倒在粪池里，没有加上盖子；有许多质量很好的土杂肥也随便堆在山边路旁，任由日晒雨淋。使许多有效的肥份都流失了。
    根据农业试验部门的分析：人畜粪尿如果不遮荫，不加盖，放置一个月就损失肥效40％以上；堆肥、厩肥和土杂肥如果四周不涂泥封顶，任由日晒雨淋就会损失肥效三成至六成；粪尿和草木灰混贮则最少损失肥效五成多。但是，有许多群众并没有注意到这一点，只看到肥料总是那么一堆，而看不到肥效的散失。据有关部门的估计，过去广东省每年因保肥工作做得不好而损失的肥料达十亿担以上。如果每亩施肥以一百担计算，就可以施肥一千万亩。广东有些地方也很注意保肥，例如东莞县良边社在三天之内全社实现了“三有”，把几千年来最不合理的、损失肥效最大的晒粪改为沤粪，把干厕改为水厕，全部粪池都加上了盖子，不但积肥好、保肥好，也改善了环境卫生。如果保肥工作能在全国普遍做好，在农业生产上将会得到很大一笔财富。　李少球
