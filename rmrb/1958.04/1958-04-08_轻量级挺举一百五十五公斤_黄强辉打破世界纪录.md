This is the fourth world record created by athletes from our country.

Today, in the clean and jerk competition, Huang Qianghui successfully lifted 145 kilograms on his first attempt. Immediately afterwards, he requested to attempt 155 kilograms. At this moment, the entire competition hall was filled with excitement, and the audience repeatedly cheered for his courageous attempt, enthusiastically applauding and wishing him success. When Huang Qianghui walked towards the barbell, the entire venue fell silent, and all eyes were focused on him. Huang Qianghui lived up to expectations and successfully lifted 155 kilograms on his second attempt. At this moment, the chief referee of the competition, national referee Zhao Zhuguang, the deputy chief referee, national referee Zeng Weiqi, and national referee Li Qilong, who served as the on-site executive issuing referees and side referees, simultaneously lit up three white lights, indicating that Huang Qianghui's clean and jerk action fully met the standards and acknowledging his two-handed clean and jerk score of 155 kilograms. The entire venue then erupted in thunderous applause and cheers. Huang Qianghui was immediately weighed on the spot, and his weight was 67.25 kilograms, which met the weight standards for lightweight athletes. The barbell that Huang Qianghui clean and jerked, after being weighed afterwards, was actually 155 kilograms without any difference.
