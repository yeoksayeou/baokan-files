Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 4th: The purchasing agents of the Beian County Food Company in Heilongjiang are now praised by farmers as "pig doctors."

Before 1957, when purchasing agents from the Beian County Food Company went to the countryside to purchase live pigs, they didn't ask about the pigs' growth or the difficulties farmers faced in raising them. They would simply "hao" (meaning to earmark) a suitable pig and leave, returning later to collect it. At that time, hog cholera was rampant in the county, and the number of live pigs remained around 22,000. Raising a pig was very difficult, and farmers were very dissatisfied with the purchasing agents, who only collected pigs and provided no assistance with production. After April 1957, the purchasing agents worked hard to learn a set of techniques for diagnosing, injecting, and administering medicine for pig diseases. They often went to the countryside with 10 to 20 kinds of medicines, combining purchasing with disease prevention. This greatly improved the relationship between the purchasing agents and the farmers. Farmers became more enthusiastic about selling pigs to the state than in the past. By the end of 1957, the number of live pigs raised in the county had increased to 39,000.

It has also been proven in the supply and marketing cooperative system that commercial workers must master technology in order to better serve production and the masses. Almost every agricultural cooperative in rural Heilongjiang province has new-style animal-powered farm implements, which frequently require small replacement parts. However, the staff of the rural supply and marketing cooperatives did not understand the technology and were unable to meet the farmers' needs. Some simply did not know what kind of parts to prepare; others prepared the parts but did not know what they were used for. Starting last year, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized its staff to learn the use, installation, and repair of machines such as gas engines and locomobiles. Currently, more than 3,500 people in grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province can install and perform simple repairs, which is very popular with farmers.

### 积极促进生产才能做好买卖  黑龙江许多商业工作者学会生产技术

    积极促进生产才能做好买卖
    黑龙江许多商业工作者学会生产技术
    据新华社哈尔滨4日电　黑龙江北安县食品公司的采购员，现在被农民称赞为“猪大夫”。
    北安县食品公司的采购员在1957年以前下乡收购生猪时，对猪的生长情况和农民养猪中的困难不闻不问，见到合适的猪“号”一下（即圈定的意思）就走，到时来收购。当时，全县猪瘟严重，生猪数量一直停留在二万二千头左右，一口猪养成很不容易，农民对采购员只管收猪而不在生产上予以帮助很不满意。1957年4月以后，采购员们努力学会了诊断、注射、下药等一套医治猪病的技术，经常带着一、二十种药品下乡，结合收购防治猪瘟。这样，大大改善了采购员与农民的关系。农民卖猪给国家比过去更加积极。全县生猪饲养的头数，到1957年底也增加到了三万九千头。
    商业工作人员必须学好技术，才能更好地为生产服务、为群众服务，这在供销合作系统也得到证明。黑龙江省农村差不多每一个农业社都有新式畜力农具，经常要配一些小零件。但是农村供销合作社的工作人员不懂技术，无法满足农民的这种要求。有的根本不知道要准备一些什么样的零件；有的准备了零件却不懂得是什么用途。从去年开始，省供销合作总社组织工作人员学习煤气机、锅驼机等机器的使用、安装、修理等技术。现在全省基层供销社已经有三千五百多人会安装、会做简单的修理工作，很受农民欢迎。
