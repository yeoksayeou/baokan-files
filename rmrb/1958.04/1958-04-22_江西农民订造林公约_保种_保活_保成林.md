Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, April 21st: After exceeding this year's afforestation tasks, various areas in Jiangxi Province are strengthening the tending of newly planted seedlings to ensure that every tree planted survives.

Currently, eighty-two counties across the province are widely carrying out afforestation and forest protection publicity activities, mobilizing farmers to sign pacts to implement "Guarantee Seedlings, Guarantee Survival, Guarantee Forest Formation." Through publicity activities, most areas have carried out tending work such as adding soil and watering newly planted seedlings. Farmers in mountainous counties like Wuyuan, Fuliang, and Hengfeng have already added soil and watered more than 200,000 mu of newly planted seedlings, and have placed plants with thorns around the seedlings to prevent trampling by wild animals and livestock. In the mountainous areas of Yugan County, forestry and agricultural cooperatives have also organized farmers with afforestation and forest protection experience to move to new forest areas, specifically responsible for tending and protection work. Along the more than 420-kilometer highway from Nanchang to Ganzhou, the newly planted seedlings have all had soil added and protective measures put in place. To prevent forest fires, the farmers of Gan County have universally established forest fire prevention organizations at the county, district, township, and cooperative levels, and have opened up thousands of li of firebreaks.

This year, Jiangxi Province has planted 4.3 million mu of trees, exceeding the original plan by 43%. Thanks to the early start of tending work this year, the survival rate of newly planted seedlings generally reaches over 90%. Each tree has now grown ten to twenty green leaves.

    江西农民订造林公约
    保种　保活　保成林
    新华社南昌21日电　在超额完成今年造林任务以后，江西省各地加强对新植树苗的抚育工作，以保证栽一株、活一株。
    目前，全省八十二个县普遍展开育林、护林宣传活动，发动农民订立公约，实行“保种、保活、保成林”。通过宣传活动，大部分地区对新植树苗进行了培土、浇水等抚育工作。山区婺源、浮梁、横峰等县农民已经为二十万多亩新植树苗培了土、浇了水，并且在幼苗周围设置带有荆刺的植物，防止野兽和牲畜的践踏。余干县山区的林业社、农业社还组织有育林、护林经验的农民迁居到新林地，专门负责抚育和保护工作。从南昌到赣州的四百二十多公里公路两旁，新植的树苗已全部培了土，安置了防护物。赣县农民为防止山林火灾，县、区、乡、社普遍建立了护林防火组织，开辟了几千华里长的防火道。
    江西省今年植树造林达四百三十万亩，超过原订计划43％。今年由于及早展开抚育工作，新植树苗的成活率一般达到90％以上，现在每株树上已长出了一二十片绿叶。
