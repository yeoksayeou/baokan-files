Xinhua News Agency, London, April 13th. Following the Easter anti-hydrogen bomb march a week ago, more than 10,000 people again held a demonstration in central London today demanding "an immediate halt to hydrogen bomb tests." This demonstration was jointly initiated by the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress.

	The marching crowd was led by an 86-year-old woman in a wheelchair, proceeding from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square. Many who had participated in the Easter march once again carried the banners that had weathered the wind and rain a week earlier. Some new participants brought new flags and slogans today, reading: "Stop Testing Now," "Achieve Security Through International Agreements," and so on.

	Labour Party Chairman Thomas Driberg spoke first at the mass meeting in Trafalgar Square, demanding that Britain immediately stop hydrogen bomb tests. Amidst a storm of applause, he said: "We say to the government: 'Change your policies, quickly negotiate for peace, or step down.'"

	Labour leader Gaitskell told the marchers that the British government should, as the Soviet government had suggested, send their diplomatic representatives in Moscow to begin discussing a top-level conference.

	Gaitskell then spoke of the Soviet Union's initiative to cease nuclear weapons testing and called on the British and American governments to do the same. He said the deadlock between East and West must be broken, and he believed that stopping nuclear weapons testing was important in this regard because it would open the door to large-scale, comprehensive disarmament. If testing were stopped, further development of nuclear weapons could be prevented and at least the nuclear arms race would be halted.

	He concluded by calling for "Stop testing, start negotiating, and make a real effort to bring peace to this troubled world."

	Bevan then spoke, addressing the current world situation, saying, "We are in an extremely dangerous situation, more dangerous than many people imagine." He said the danger was not that the Soviet Union would suddenly attack the West, because Soviet leaders would never have such an idea. The danger lies in the fact that American bombers are patrolling the skies day and night, placing the whole world "on the brink of war and in a state of constant mobilization."

	Bevan emphasized that stopping nuclear weapons testing would make the greatest direct contribution to eliminating tensions between the Soviet Union and Western countries.

	He condemned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for handing over nuclear weapons to West Germany as a "crude provocation."

	Bevan appealed, "The time has come for the labor movement to unite." He said, "At the most urgent moment in our history, all the forces that make up the labor movement—various, diverse, and sometimes seemingly contradictory forces—must now agree to unite and accomplish what we can in our current situation."

	He said that the labor movement has decided to organize demonstrations across the country.

	Tom O'Brien, the main speaker for the Trades Union Congress, said that today's demonstration is extremely important because today's issue is more important than all the issues in the world. He said that unless nuclear energy is controlled, the hydrogen bomb will destroy all mankind.

	After the mass meeting, hundreds of people marched towards Downing Street, where the Prime Minister's residence is located, but were blocked by a large number of police at the street entrance.

	More than 500 participants in the "Walk for Peace" movement from six states in the United States, after several days of walking, finally converged in New York on April 4th and held a demonstration at the United Nations headquarters. They submitted a petition to United Nations officials, calling for an immediate halt to nuclear weapons testing. The photo shows demonstrators en route to the United Nations headquarters.

### 停止核试验才能为裁军打开大门  伦敦万人示威抗议氢弹试验

    停止核试验才能为裁军打开大门
    伦敦万人示威抗议氢弹试验
    新华社伦敦13日电　继一星期前复活节反对氢弹大游行之后，今天一万多人又在伦敦市中心举行了一次要求“立即停止氢弹试验”的示威游行。这次示威游行是由工党和职工大会联合发起的。
    游行队伍由一位坐在轮椅中的八十六岁高龄的老太太为前导，从海德公园走向特拉法加广场。许多曾经参加过复活节游行的人，今天又一次举着那在一星期以前饱受风吹雨打的旗帜。一些新参加的人今天带来了新的旗帜和标语，上面写着：“立即停止试验”，“通过国际协议来取得安全”等等。
    工党主席托马斯·德赖伯在特拉法加广场的群众大会上首先发言，他要求英国立即停止氢弹试验。他在暴风雨般的掌声中说：“我们对政府说：‘改变你们的政策，赶快谈判和平，要不然就下台。’”
    工党领袖盖次克尔对游行者说，英国政府应该像苏联政府所建议的那样派他们在莫斯科的外交代表去开始商谈最高级会议的事。
    盖次克尔接着谈到苏联主动停止核武器试验的决定，并且要求英国政府和美国政府也这样做。他说，东西方之间的僵局必须打破，他认为停止核武器试验在这方面是重要的，因为它将为大规模广泛裁军打开大门。如果停止试验的话，将可以制止核武器的进一步发展，并且至少会停止核武器竞赛。
    他最后要求“停止试验，开始谈判，并且作出真正的努力来为这个多难的世界带来和平”。
    比万接着发言，他谈到目前世界局势的时候说，“我们正处在极其危险的情况中，这种情况比许多人所想像的更加危险。”他说，危险不在于苏联会突然进攻西方，因为苏联领袖们根本不会有这种想法。危险是在于美国轰炸机日夜在天空巡逻，使全世界“处在战争的边缘和一种经常的动员状态中”。
    比万强调说，停止核武器试验将会对消除苏联和西方国家之间的紧张局势作出最大的直接贡献。
    他谴责北大西洋集团把核武器交给西德是一种“粗暴的挑衅行为”。
    比万呼吁说，“工人运动团结起来的时候已经来到了。”他说，“在我们历史上最紧急的关头，组成工人运动的一切力量——各种多样的、有时候甚至显然是有矛盾的力量——现在必须同意团结起来，并且完成在我们当前情况下所能做到的事。”
    他说，工人运动已经决定在全国组织示威游行。
    职工大会的主要发言人汤姆·奥勃莱恩说，今天的示威游行是极其重要的，因为今天的问题比世界上一切问题都重要。他说，除非对核能加以控制，氢弹将会毁灭全人类。
    在群众大会以后，有成百的人走向首相官邸所在的唐宁街，但是在街口受到了大批警察的阻拦。美国人民“为和平奔走”

    来自美国六个州的五百余名“为和平奔走”运动的参加者，经过多日步行，最后于4月4日在纽约会合，到联合国总部举行示威。他们向联合国官员递交一份呼吁书，要求立即停止核武器试验。照片是示威者在赴联合国总部途中。
