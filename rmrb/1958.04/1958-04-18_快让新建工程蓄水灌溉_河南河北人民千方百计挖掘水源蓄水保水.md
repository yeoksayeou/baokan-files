Quickly Let Newly Built Projects Store Water for Irrigation
People in Henan and Hebei Provinces are Doing Everything Possible to Excavate Water Sources to Store and Conserve Water

(Our report) As the mass small-scale water conservancy projects in Henan Province are about to conclude, they are immediately launching a water storage and conservation campaign of "full ponds, full reservoirs, and full cellars," so that the newly built water conservancy projects can exert their irrigation role in the shortest possible time.

Henan Province currently has relatively little rainfall in the spring, and some water conservancy projects do not have much water stored. According to a recent survey, the province still has water conservancy projects capable of irrigating more than 20 million mu of land without water, and some projects have only half a pond of water. This will affect the current water use for rice paddies and the irrigation of wheat fields.

In response to this situation, various parts of Henan Province have put forward the slogan "Building reservoirs is like building granaries, storing water is like storing grain," and launched a water storage and conservation campaign. People in mountainous, plain, hilly, and low-lying areas are using methods such as damming river water, diverting mountain spring water, excavating groundwater, and intercepting external water to fill all water conservancy projects with water. Currently, on the two hundred and twenty rivers in the province, apart from larger rivers such as the Yellow River, Huai River, and Wei River, many river dams have been built on other medium and small rivers to raise water levels and fill reservoirs and ponds. Xinxiang County has already intercepted one hundred and eighty rivers and ditches, excavated eighty-three mountain springs, diverted water to fill more than eight thousand one hundred ponds, and irrigated more than one hundred and ten reservoirs, connecting river water to reservoirs to form an above-ground water conservancy network. In places where it is not possible to connect with river water, efforts are now being made to excavate groundwater. There are already thirty-eight thousand ponds across the province with springs underneath, allowing groundwater to flow into the ponds through the springs, ensuring that each pond can store rainwater and absorb groundwater, guaranteeing an ample water supply throughout the seasons. The "Leap Forward Cone," a tool for creating underground springs invented by the masses in Neihuang County, has increased work efficiency sixfold, accelerating the work of creating springs in ponds throughout the province. At the same time, the method of creating underground springs has also been used to renovate many shallow wells. Drilling artesian springs is also a good method because artesian springs save labor, materials, and land. Farmers in mountainous areas throughout the province have already excavated more than nineteen thousand artesian springs between two mountains, at the end of mountains, and in places where aquatic plants are relatively lush. These artesian springs generally spew out seventy tons of water per hour, and those with strong water flow reach more than one hundred tons of water per hour. It is estimated that the province can increase its water flow by more than three hundred units.

Through the above-mentioned water storage and conservation activities, many areas have already achieved full reservoirs and ponds. (Zhang Lizhong)

(Our report) In many places along the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains and on the southern and northern sides of the Yanshan Mountains in Hebei Province, many professional teams composed of farmers have been busy searching for and developing underground spring sources these days. According to incomplete statistics from eight special districts alone, farmers have already found more than seventy-six thousand spring sources, and completed the excavation, drilling, and chiseling of more than thirteen thousand wells. In the mountainous counties of Baoding Special District, there are currently more than twenty-five thousand laborers in the spring drilling teams, who have completed the excavation, drilling, and chiseling of more than one thousand nine hundred wells, with a water flow rate of forty-eight point two four cubic meters per second, and have begun to transport water to downstream areas to irrigate dry land.

In order to solve the problem of the lack of water sources for irrigation projects, Hebei Province has decided to strengthen irrigation management to achieve water conservation, and vigorously develop underground water sources. The province plans to find underground spring water with a total flow rate of five hundred cubic meters per second in the mountainous areas this year. The realization of this plan will enable five million mu of rice paddies or twenty million mu of dry land to be irrigated.

    快让新建工程蓄水灌溉
    河南河北人民千方百计挖掘水源蓄水保水
    本报讯　河南省在群众性的小型水利工程将告结束的时候，紧接着又展开了塘满、库满、窖满的蓄水保水运动，使新建的水利工程能在最短期间发挥灌溉作用。
    河南省目前由于春季雨水较少，有些水利工程蓄水不多。据不久以前调查，全省尚有能浇两千多万亩地的水利工程没有水，还有一些工程只有半塘水。这样将影响当前稻田的用水和麦田的灌溉。
    根据这一情况，河南省各地提出“修库如修仓，积水如积粮”的口号，开展蓄水保水运动。山地、平原、丘陵和低洼地区的人们用拦起河里水、引出山泉水、挖出地下水、截住外来水等办法，使所有的水利工程蓄起水来。现在全省二百二十多条河流，除了黄河、淮河、卫河等比较大的河流以外，在其他中、小河流上，筑起了很多拦河坝，抬高水位，灌注水库和塘堰。信阳县已经截住了一百八十条河流和水沟，挖山泉八十三眼，引水灌满塘堰八千一百多个，灌水库一百一十多座，使河水与水库相通，形成地上水利网。在不能与河水相连的地方，现在正在大力挖掘地下水，全省已有三十八万个塘里下了泉眼，使地下水通过泉眼冒到塘里，使每个塘既能蓄住雨水，又能吸取地下水，保证四季水源充足。内黄县群众创造的下泉工具“跃进锥”，提高工作效率六倍，使全省塘中下泉工作加快了速度。同时，还用下泉的办法，改造了很多浅井。打自流泉也是一个好办法，因为自流泉省工、省料、省地基，全省山区农民在两山之间、山的尽头、水草比较茂盛的地方，已挖出一万九千多处自流泉。这些自流泉，一般每小时喷出七十吨水，水旺者每小时达一百多吨水，估计全省可以提高三百多个流量的水。
    经过以上各种蓄水保水活动，好多地区已经库满塘平。（张励中）
    本报讯　河北省境内太行山东麓和燕山南、北两边的许多地方，这些天有许多农民组成的凿泉专业队在忙着寻找和开发地下泉源。仅据八个专区的不完全统计，目前农民们已经找到的泉源即有七万六千多处，完成挖泉、锥泉和凿泉共一万三千多眼。保定专区各山区县份现在有二万五千多个劳力的凿泉队已完成挖泉、锥泉和凿泉一千九百多眼，涌水量达到四十八点二四秒公方，并已开始输水供下游地区浇灌旱地。
    河北省为了解决灌溉工程水源缺乏的问题，决定一面加强灌溉管理，作到节约用水；一面大力开发地下水源，全省计划今年要在山区找到流量共达五百秒公方的地下泉水，实现这一计划就可以使五百万亩稻田或二千万亩旱地得到灌溉。
