    Changsha Automobile Electrical Appliance Factory Completed
    The state-owned Changsha Automobile Electrical Appliance Factory has been completed two months ahead of schedule and has begun trial production in small batches.
    The factory produces ten types of products, including DC and AC generators, starters, magnetos, regulators, distributors, and car light switches, in dozens of different models, which can basically meet the needs of various major electrical equipment on domestically produced automobiles and tractors.
    This modern factory was built according to the latest Soviet technical conditions. It has four major workshops: machining, heat processing, stamping, and final assembly, each with three or four work sections. In addition, there are two auxiliary workshops for machinery and power, and tools, responsible for the factory's machine repair and tool manufacturing.

    长沙汽车电器厂建成
    国营长沙汽车电器厂已经比计划提前两个月建成，并开始小批试制产品。
    这个厂所生产的直流、交流发电机、起动机、磁电器、调节器、分电器、车灯开关等十种品种、几十种不同型号的产品，能够基本上满足我国自制的汽车和拖拉机上各种主要电器设备的需要。
    这个现代化工厂是按照苏联最新技术条件建设的。有机械加工、热加工、冲压、总装配四大车间，每个车间都有三、四个工段。另外还有机械、动力和工具两个辅助车间，负责全厂机修和工具的制造。
