    Unattended: 1,500 Cubic Meters of Timber
    Location: Zhangcuo Township, Shaowu County, Fujian

    In 1955, the Shaowu County Forestry Bureau sent a logging team to Yangtou Daping and other villages in Zhangcuo Township to cut pine wood for use as railway ties for the Yingxia Railway. The Yingxia Railway has long been completed, but there are still 1,500 cubic meters of timber piled up in Zhangcuo Township. More than two years have passed, and this 1,500 cubic meters of timber has remained unattended, exposed to wind and rain, and consumed by termites, which is heartbreaking for the masses to see. Wu Yongnian, the township head of this township, raised his concerns with Director Li of the Shaowu County Forestry Bureau, but was ignored and treated with a poor attitude. If the Forestry Bureau doesn't care, who will?

    We have calculated that each cubic meter of timber costs about 25 yuan, including the mountain price and logging wages, totaling 37,500 yuan for 1,500 cubic meters. This is the property of the state and the people, and we should not bear to neglect it. We demand that it be taken care of quickly and dealt with promptly.

    无人管：一千五百立方公尺木材
    地点在福建邵武县张厝乡
    邵武县森林工业局在1955年派了砍伐队到张厝乡洋头大坪等村砍伐松木，供鹰厦铁路作枕木用。鹰厦路早已修成了，可是还有一千五百立方公尺的木材堆在张厝乡。事隔二年多，这一千五百立方公尺木材一直无人管，任凭风吹雨打，让白蚁充饥，群众看了真心痛。本乡乡长吴永年向邵武县森工局李局长提意见，没有被理睬，而且态度也不好。森工局不管究竟那里管呢？
    我们计算了一下：每立方公尺木材山价加砍伐工资，需要二十五元左右，一千五百立方公尺共值三万七千五百元。这是国家和人民的财产，不应当忍心不管。我们要求快快管起来，快快处理。
              （吴永年、陈宏良）
