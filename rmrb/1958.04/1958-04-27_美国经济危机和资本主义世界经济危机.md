    The U.S. Economic Crisis and the Capitalist World Economic Crisis
    Academician Varga of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
    Editor's Note: In the preface to the Chinese version of the book "World Economic Crisis 1848-1935," the famous Soviet economist Academician Varga analyzed the current situation of the U.S. economic crisis and the world capitalist economic crisis. The following is an excerpt from this section:
    The World Capitalist Economic Crisis of 1958
    At the time of writing this material, it is of course impossible to make a broad analysis of the first global crisis of overproduction after the war: because this crisis has only just begun. Many bourgeois economists are still asserting that the U.S. crisis of overproduction will be the same as the intermediate crises of 1948 and 1953, and that a crisis of overproduction in the entire capitalist world will not occur at all.
    We believe that the capitalist world has entered the realm of cyclical crises of overproduction. Our judgment is based on the following facts and analysis:
    The U.S. crisis will not be a short-term intermediate crisis, but a real and profound crisis. The history of past cycles and crises shows that the longer the period of upswing, the more profound and prolonged the crisis of overproduction will usually be. Because the longer the upswing, the deeper the contradiction between the capitalists' attempts to expand production infinitely and the limited social purchasing power. According to historical analysis, the U.S. crisis should be an acute and non-short-term crisis.
      (1) During the postwar cyclical era, U.S. industrial fixed capital investment has expanded to such an extent that it has not been fully utilized even during the production upswing phase. When the crisis begins, capitalists begin to reduce their investment. Authoritative sources predict that if investment is reduced by 10% in 1958, it will reach $5 billion. In early March 1958, the U.S. Department of Commerce published a research material, according to which fixed capital investment in 1958 had already been reduced by 13% compared with 1957.
      (2) The most important factor in further deepening the U.S. crisis is the continuous reduction in the number of new orders each month. The average number of new industrial orders for the whole of 1956 and the first half of 1957 was $28 billion. Nevertheless, the crisis still broke out. And now the number of new orders each month is decreasing rapidly.
    Following the reduction in orders should be a reduction in production. In this respect, industrial production has been maintained by old orders for a year. The number of unfulfilled orders has been constantly reduced from $64 billion in January 1957 to $51.8 billion in November 1957.
      (3) The crisis has caused a rapid increase in unemployment and a decrease in the purchasing power of the working class. According to official statistics, the number of unemployed has increased from 3.2 million at the beginning of 1957 to 5.1 million in February 1958. In fact, the number of unemployed is much higher than the official figures, as can be seen from the following fact: the highest employment in July 1957 was 70.2 million (excluding the munitions production sector), and in January 1958 employment decreased to 62.2 million, a decrease of 8 million. And the number of unemployed already reached 3 million in July 1957, so it seems that the number of unemployed should be 11 million. The reason for this difference in the number of unemployed is that U.S. statistics also include millions of workers "not included in the labor force." At the same time, the average weekly working hours have been reduced from 41 hours in December 1956 to 38.7 hours in January 1958, and workers have lost the supplementary income from overtime. All of this shows that workers' wages have been greatly reduced. According to our estimates, the total reduction in wages in one year is about $15 billion. The income workers receive in the form of subsidies accounts for only a tiny part of their total lost wages. The reduction in the number of wages will inevitably lead to a significant reduction in the demand for industrial products in the second category (i.e., consumer goods - editor), because the reduction in wages forces workers and their families to first ensure their basic necessities of life, such as food, housing and transportation expenses. This will also inevitably promote the further deepening of the crisis in 1958. As for the ruling class, their profit margins were already lower in the fourth quarter of 1957 than in the same quarter of 1956. Profits will continue to decline in 1958. Therefore, the sales volume of luxury goods will also decrease.
    Considering all these factors, there is no scientific basis for asserting that the U.S. crisis of overproduction will end soon. On the contrary, the production index in February 1958 fell to 130, which means that it fell by 11% compared with the highest level of this cycle (December 1956), but this does not mean that the crisis has reached its extreme depth. A commentary from some of the largest banks in March 1958 stated: "Employers...are not building their plans on the hope of a quick turnaround. They are both prudent and vigilant."
    As in the crisis of 1929-1933, the "optimists" hope that the government's "anti-crisis" measures will end the crisis.
    However, this hope is unfounded. The so-called public works (construction of roads, hospitals, etc.) that have not yet begun will only increase workers' purchasing power after one year. Eisenhower has suggested extending the period for paying subsidies to the unemployed, but this measure has no effect on the progress of the crisis, because half of the unemployed do not receive subsidies, and those who receive subsidies (generally one-third of their wages) have to use this money for their most necessary food and housing expenses; there is no money left to buy industrial products.
    Loan measures, such as lowering credit rates and easing borrowing conditions, rarely work in the event of a crisis, because in times of crisis, the circulation of goods is reduced, and the circulation of cash will also shrink (if there is no credit crisis); cash will flow to the capitalists who advance them, and those who need loans in times of crisis are generally not trusted.
    The only effective step taken by the U.S. government is to expand military orders. Military orders in the first half of 1958 increased by $4 billion compared with the first half of 1957. Although this is also a large amount, it is far from enough to prevent the further deepening of the crisis, because in January 1958 alone, the number of new orders accepted by U.S. industry was $4.5 billion less than in January 1957. In this way, the measures taken by the U.S. government may alleviate the situation to some extent, but they cannot prevent the further deepening of the crisis.
    The characteristic of this crisis is that the most important factor in overcoming the crisis - lowering prices - has only just begun. Monopoly capitalists are still pursuing high prices. Inflation is also hindering the reduction of prices. Therefore, retail prices have not yet been reduced. Of course, this will hinder the development of production and prolong the crisis.
    In summary, it can be said that although the U.S. economic crisis may not be as deep and lasting as the crisis of 1929-1933, this crisis will be deeper and more lasting than the previous crises of overproduction, and it is the beginning of a global crisis of overproduction.
  The U.S. Crisis is the Beginning of a Global Capitalist Crisis of Overproduction
    U.S. industrial production accounts for about half of the capitalist world's industrial production. Therefore, the U.S. crisis cannot but affect the economies of other capitalist countries. The intermediate crises that occurred in the United States in the past did not cause crises in other countries, because these countries did not have the internal prerequisites for an economic crisis at that time, and this prerequisite was the decisive factor. The situation is different now. The conditions for a crisis have matured in most capitalist countries. The global crisis of overproduction has in fact begun. The following facts are sufficient to confirm this:
    (1) Overproduction and falling raw material prices throughout the world: the fall in prices of non-ferrous metals, coal (UK, US, West Germany), steel (the production capacity of the U.S. steel industry is only used by half), oil, cellulose (Scandinavian countries) and other raw materials.
      (2) The global crisis in shipbuilding and shipping: in February 1958, the tonnage of ships lying idle reached 3 million tons. New ships are built and stored directly from the shipyard. Orders for new ships have also been cancelled, and freight rates have been reduced by 70% compared with a year ago.
      (3) Investment is beginning to decline not only in the United States but also in all industrial countries; during the boom period, these countries created many surplus production capacities that exceeded their market capacity.
    It is not yet possible to analyze the development of the global crisis of overproduction; we can only make a brief comment.
    The economic crisis is most obvious in Canada because it has the closest ties with the United States. In January of this year, Canada already had 520,000 unemployed workers.
    British industrial production has been stagnant for three years. The shipbuilding and shipping industries are facing a crisis of overproduction, and crises are also beginning to emerge in coal mining and investment. According to a survey by the British Employers' Association, the number of new orders for 45% of the members of this association has decreased in the past six months. The government's anti-inflation measures have complicated the situation, and the prices of coal and steel have been lowered for the first time in twenty years.
    West Germany's "economic miracle" is disappearing, and the expansion of fixed capital is also shrinking, and the scope of construction is also shrinking. Three million tons of coal have been stockpiled in the Ruhr, and working hours in the mine have been reduced by one shift per week. The production of steel and steel pipes, etc., all decreased in March.
    The crisis of overproduction has largely enveloped Japan. Crises can be seen in shipbuilding, shipping, and the textile industry.
    In this way, in the major industrial countries, and even in some small countries: such as Belgium, Norway, etc., the crisis of overproduction has already begun. (Xinhua News Agency)

    美国经济危机和资本主义世界经济危机
    苏联科学院院士　瓦尔加
    编者按：苏联著名经济学家瓦尔加院士在最近为“1848—1935年世界经济危机”一书中文版所写的序言中，对目前美国经济危机和世界资本主义经济危机的情况进行了分析。现将这一部分摘译如下：
    1958年的世界资本主义经济危机
    在我们写这个材料的时候，当然还不能对战后第一个生产过剩的世界性危机作出广泛的分析：因为这个危机才刚刚开始。许多资产阶级经济学家仍在断言，说美国生产过剩的危机将同1948和1953年的中间性危机一样，而整个资本主义世界的生产过剩的危机根本不会发生。
    我们认为，资本主义世界已经进入了周期性生产过剩危机的领域。我们根据的事实和分析如下：
    美国的危机将不是一个短时期的中间性危机，而将是一个真正的深刻的危机。历次周期和危机的历史表明，高涨的时期延长，生产过剩危机照例也就越深刻，延续的时间也就越长。因为高涨的时间越长，资本家无限扩大生产的企图和社会购买力的有限性之间的矛盾也将越深。根据历史的分析，美国的危机应是一个尖锐的、非短期性质的危机。
      （一）战后周期年代中，美国工业的固定资本投资已经扩大到即使在生产上升阶段它也远未被全部利用的程度。当危机开始时，资本家就开始缩减自己的投资。权威方面预计，1958年投资如果缩减10％，那么将达到五十亿美元。1958年3月初美国贸易部曾经发表一份研究材料，根据这个材料，1958年固定资本的投资就已经比1957年缩减13％。
      （二）美国危机进一步深刻化的最主要的因素是每月新订货的数目在不断减少。1956年全年和1957年上半年工业新订货的平均数字是二百八十亿美元。尽管如此，危机还是爆发了。而现在每月新订货的数目正在加速地减少着。
    继订货的缩减之后接踵而来的应是生产的缩减。这方面工业生产已经有一年的时间是靠旧订货维持的。尚未完成的订货数目已不断地由1957年1月的六百四十亿美元减到1957年11月的五百一十八亿美元。
      （三）危机引起了失业人数的迅速增长和工人阶级购买力的降低。根据官方统计，失业人数已由1957年初的三百二十万人增长到1958年2月的五百一十万人。事实上失业人数大大超过官方的数字，这可由以下的事实看出：1957年7月最高的就业人数是七千零二十万人（不包括军火生产部门），1958年1月就业人数降低到六千二百二十万人，即减少了八百万。而失业工人在1957年7月就已达三百万人，由此看来，失业人数应是一千一百万人。失业人数的这种差别的原因是：美国的统计是把几百万“不包括在劳动力构成之内”的工作者也计算在内的。同时，每周平均工作时间已由1956年12月的四十一小时降低到1958年1月的三十八点七小时，工人失去了加班所得的补充收入。所有这一切都表明，工人的工资大大地减少了。根据我们的估计，一年中工资缩减总数约达一百五十亿美元。工人以补助金的形式得到的收入在其失去的工资总数中只占极其微小的一部分。工资数目的缩减必将引起对生产第二部类（即消费资料——编）的工业产品的需求的显著降低，因为工资的缩减使工人和他们的家庭首先设法保证自己的生活必需品，如饮食、房屋和交通用费等。这也必将促使危机在1958年内进一步深刻化。至于谈到统治阶级，那么他们的利润额早在1957年第四季度就比1956年同一季度降低了。1958年的利润还将下降。所以奢侈品的销售量也将减少。
    考虑到所有这些因素，断言美国生产过剩的危机将会很快终结是没有任何科学依据的。相反的，1958年2月的生产指数下降到一百三十，也就是说比这一周期的最高水平（1956年12月）降低了11％，但是这并不意味着危机已经达到了极限的深度。1958年3月一些最大的银行的评述指出：“雇主……并不把自己的计划建筑在希望很快发生转折的基础上。他们既审慎又警惕”。
    如同1929—1933年时的危机一样，“乐观分子”希望政府的“反危机”措施将会结束危机。
    但是，这种希望是没有基础的。尚未开始的所谓公共工程（建设道路、医院等等）只有在一年之后才能提高工人的购买力。艾森豪威尔曾经建议延长发给失业者补助金的期限，但是这个措施对危机的进程是没有作用的，因为半数失业者领不到补助金，而那些领到补助金的人（一般可以得到工资的三分之一）却不得不把这些钱用于他们所最必需的食和住的开销上；购买工业品的钱是一点剩不下的。
    贷款方面的措施，如降低信贷率和放宽借款条件，在危机的情况下很少发生作用，因为在危机时期由于商品流通缩减，现金流转也将缩小（如果没有信贷危机的话）；现金将流到预支它们的那些资本家手中，而那些在危机时期需要贷款的人一般又都得不到信任。
    美国政府所采取的唯一有作用的步骤是扩大军事订货。1958年上半年的军事订货比1957年上半年增加了四十亿美元。虽然这也是一笔很大的数目，但是它远远不足以阻止危机的进一步深化，因为仅在1958年1月份，美国工业接受的新订货额就比1957年1月减少四十五亿美元。这样，美国政府所采取的措施可能多少缓和一点局势，但是不能阻止危机的进一步深刻化。
    这次危机的特点是：克服危机的最重要的因素——降低物价才刚刚开始。垄断资本家还在继续追逐高价。通货膨胀也在妨碍着物价的降低。因此零售价格目前还没有降低。当然这将阻碍生产的发展并使危机延长。
    综上所述，可以这样说，尽管美国的经济危机可能不会像1929—1933年的危机那样深刻和持久，但是这次危机将比前几次生产过剩的危机来得更深刻和更持久，它是世界性的生产过剩危机的开端。
  美国的危机是世界性资本
  主义生产过剩危机的开端
    美国工业生产约占资本主义世界工业生产的半数。因此，美国的危机不能不影响到其它资本主义国家的经济。美国过去发生的中间性危机没有引起其它国家的危机，这是因为这些国家里当时还没有发生经济危机的内在前提，而这种前提又恰恰是决定性的因素。现在的情况不同了。现在大多数资本主义国家发生危机的条件已经成熟。世界性的生产过剩危机事实上已经开始了。下列事实足以证实这一点：
    （一）整个世界上的生产过剩和原料价格的跌落：有色金属、煤（英、美、西德），钢铁（美国钢铁工业的生产能力仅利用二分之一），石油、纤维素（斯堪的纳维亚国家）和其他原料价格的跌落。
      （二）造船业和航运业的世界性危机：在1958年2月闲歇不用的船只吨位已达三百万吨。新船造成后从造船厂开出直接就贮存起来。制造新船舶的定货也取消了，运费比一年前减少了70％。
      （三）不仅在美国并且在所有的工业国家投资开始减少；还在繁荣时期这些国家就造成了许多超出其市场容量范围的过剩生产能力。
    现在还不能对世界性的生产过剩危机的发展加以分析，我们只能加以简短的评述。
    经济危机在加拿大表现得最为明显，因为它同美国有最紧密的联系。今年1月份加拿大就已经有五十二万失业工人。
    英国的工业生产已经在三年以来一直停滞不前。造船业和航运业正面临着生产过剩的危机，采煤和投资方面也开始产生危机。根据英国业主协会的调查，最近六个月来这个协会中45％的成员的新定货量都缩减了。政府反通货膨胀的措施使形式更加复杂化了，二十年来首次降低了煤和钢的价格。
    西德的“经济奇迹”正在消失，固定资本的扩大也在缩小，建筑范围也正在缩小。在鲁尔积压了三百万吨煤，而矿内的工作时间，在一周内已减少了一班。在3月里钢和钢管的生产等都减少了。
    生产过剩危机在很大的程度上已经笼罩了日本。造船业、航运业和纺织业等方面都可看到危机。
    这样，在主要的工业国，甚至在一些小的国家：如比利时、挪威等也已经开始了生产过剩危机。　（新华社）
