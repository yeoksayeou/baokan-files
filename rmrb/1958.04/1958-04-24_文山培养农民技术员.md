Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture plans to train 30,000 farmer technicians in a concentrated effort within April. In the past few months, the autonomous prefecture has successively trained more than 2,000 farmer technicians. By the end of April, when all the training is completed, each large production team in the autonomous prefecture will have more than two farmer technicians, and each small production team will have more than one. In this way, it not only provides a technical guarantee for the Great Leap Forward, but also lays the foundation for the "redness" and "expertise" of grassroots cadres.

    文山培养农民技术员
    本报讯　文山僮族苗族自治州要在4月份内突击培养农民技术员三万人。几月来，该自治州已先后训练了农民技术员二千多人。到4月底训练全部结束时，该自治州各地的农业社，每个大的生产队就有两个以上的农民技术员，小的生产队也有一个以上。这样，非但在技术上给大跃进提供了保证，同时还给基层干部的“红”和“专”打下了基础。
