    Straw Brews Wine, Makes Paper; Tofu Dregs Make Pastries
    (Our report) The Changzhou Public-Private Joint溥利仁 Oil Factory is able to brew wine from straw. The straw powder left after brewing wine can also be used as feed or for papermaking. They grind soybeans that have been pressed for oil into flour to make white and tender tofu. They can also use the leftover tofu dregs to make delicious pastries and biscuits. They also use the bran left after pressing oil to brew wine, and use the wine lees to feed pigs... Once rice bran, straw, and soybeans enter this factory, they become a variety of products. They call this successful experiment "comprehensive utilization of resources."
    After the comprehensive utilization of resources was implemented in this factory, it reversed the situation of low equipment utilization rate and frequent state losses. Last year, it comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan and made a profit of 85,000 yuan. The number of product varieties has increased from the original four to twelve, and the original equipment has also been fully utilized. If this practice can be promoted, just in terms of using tofu dregs to replace flour for making pastries, Changzhou city alone can save 3 million jin of grain per year. If the method of using straw to brew wine is promoted in Jiangsu Province, more than 67.7 million dan of barley can be saved each year, and more than 33.5 million dan of white wine can be produced.

    稻草酿酒造纸  豆腐渣做糕点
    本报讯　常州市公私合营溥利仁油厂能够从稻草里酿出酒来，酿过酒的稻草粉，还可以用来做饲料或造纸。他们把榨了油的大豆磨成粉，可以做成又白又嫩的豆腐，还可以用剩下来的豆腐渣子做成可口的糕点和饼干。他们把榨过油的糠又拿来酿酒，用酿了酒的糠糟喂猪……。米糠、稻草、大豆一到这个工厂，就成了多种多样的产品。他们把这种成功的试验叫做“资源的综合利用”。
    资源综合利用，在这个工厂实现以后，扭转了设备利用率低、国家经常赔钱的局面，去年全面超额完成了国家计划，盈余了八万五千元。生产品种由原来的四种增加到十二种，原来的设备也充分利用起来了。如能推广这种做法，仅在利用豆腐渣代面粉做点心一个方面，在常州一市每年就可以节约粮食三百万斤。如果在江苏省推广利用稻草酿酒的方法，每年就可以节省大麦六千七百多万担，还可以增产白酒三千三百五十多万担。
