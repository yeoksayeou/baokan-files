Xinhua News Agency, London, April 1st: The British, French, and American governments submitted identical notes to the Soviet government on March 31 regarding the issue of an East-West summit meeting.

    This brief, one-page note avoids answering a series of positive proposals recently put forward by the Soviet government on the agenda for a high-level meeting, and continues to emphasize the need for "preparatory work" for the summit.

    The note states that holding a summit meeting is appropriate in the current circumstances, "if it can provide an opportunity for serious discussion of major issues and can become an effective means of reaching agreement on major issues."

    The note states that summit meetings require preparation. This preparation is best achieved through an exchange of views through diplomatic channels, leading to a meeting of foreign ministers. The main purpose of the preparatory work is to "study the attitudes of the various governments on the main issues on which they disagree and to determine which issues should be submitted to the heads of government for study. The purpose of these preparatory talks is not to make decisions, but to generate the possibility of reaching agreements through general discussions."

    When "the foreign ministers believe they have satisfactorily completed the preparatory talks, they can agree on the date and location of the summit meeting and decide on the members to participate in the summit meeting."

    The note states that if this step is acceptable to the Soviet government, the three countries suggest that the exchange of views through diplomatic channels begin in Moscow in the second half of April.

    A dispatch from Washington by a Western news agency states that, according to the note, the task of the foreign ministers seems to be different from the statements previously made by Secretary of State Dulles and others. "However, US officials insist that the Western note does not indicate any change in attitude."

    在召开高级会议问题上
    美英法继续唱慢板
    强调准备再准备　企图拖延又拖延
    据新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：英国、法国和美国政府3月31日把一份关于东西方最高级会议问题的内容相同的照会分别送交苏联政府。
    这份只有一页长的简短照会避而不答苏联政府最近就高级会议的议程问题所提出的一系列积极的建议，而继续强调最高级会议必须进行“准备工作”。
    照会说，在目前情况下，举行最高级会议是相宜的，“如果它可以提供机会对重大问题进行认真的讨论，而且可以成为就重大问题达成协议的有效手段的话。”
    照会说，最高级会议需要进行准备工作。这种准备工作最好是通过外交途径交换意见，从而导致外长会议。准备工作的主要目的是“研究各国政府在它们之间有分歧的主要问题上所持的态度，并且确定应当把哪些问题提交政府首脑们研究。这些准备会谈的目的不是作出决定，而是通过一般讨论产生达成协议的可能性。”
    当“外长们认为他们已经满意地结束准备会谈后，就可以就最高级会议的日期和地点达成协议，并且决定参加最高级会议的成员。”
    照会表示，如果这个步骤可以为苏联政府接受，三国建议通过外交途径交换意见的工作在4月下半月在莫斯科开始。
    西方通讯社从华盛顿发出的一条消息说，根据照会的说法，外长会议的任务似乎跟以前国务卿杜勒斯和其他一些人所发表的声明有所不同。“但是，美国官员却坚决说西方照会并不表明态度有任何改变。”
