    The Shanghai No. 3 State-owned Pharmaceutical Factory has dried and ground aureomycin residue, which was previously discarded as garbage, for feeding chickens and pigs, with good results.
    According to experiments, mixing two to three centimeters of aureomycin residue powder into each kilogram of dry feed for chickens and pigs can increase the weight of the chickens (or pigs) by about 10% (suitable for chickens weighing more than half a kilogram and pigs weaned for half a month).

    金霉素渣喂鸡喂猪
    国营上海第三制药厂把过去当作垃圾丢掉的金霉素残渣烘干磨粉，用来喂鸡喂猪，效果良好。
    据试验，每公斤干饲料中，拌入二、三公分金霉素残渣粉，用来喂鸡和猪，鸡（或猪）的体重可以增长10％左右。（体重半公斤以上的鸡和断乳半个月后的猪才宜用）
