A Note

    U.S. Secretary of Commerce Weeks, at a banquet in New York, boasted about the U.S. economic situation, saying, "The U.S. economy is moving towards heights even higher than those already reached!"
    Whether Weeks was drunk or suffering from hysteria, we have no way of knowing. However, according to a dispatch from the Associated Press, he deflated himself in less than a minute after his boasting. He had to admit, "When I say that, it doesn't mean we're out of trouble." It turned out that the "advancing" he spoke of was merely "advancing" in trouble.

    自己泄气
    美国商务部长威克斯在纽约的一个宴会上对美国的经济状况大吹大擂说：“美国的经济正在朝着比已经达到的高度还要高的高处前进！”
    威克斯究竟是喝醉了，还是害着歇斯底里症，我们无从查考。但是，据美联社的电讯说，他大吹大擂还不到一分钟，就自己泄了气。他不得不承认：“我这样说并不意味着我们已经摆脱困境。”原来他所说的“前进”不过是在困境中的“前进”。
