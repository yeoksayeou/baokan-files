Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd - Old technician Yuan Genbao and technician Liu Shutang of the Shanghai Light Bulb Factory, in collaboration, recently successfully trial-produced a set of automatic tube drawing machines. This is a significant technological innovation in China's glass industry production.

The completion of this tube drawing machine solves a long-standing problem in China's glass industry. In the past, the heavy physical labor caused workers' physical strength and eyesight to deteriorate prematurely. Workers could no longer perform tube drawing work before the age of fifty. It used to take at least two to three years, or even four to five years, to train a skilled tube drawing worker. Now, with the tube drawing machine, older workers in their fifties and sixties can still engage in tube drawing production. Training a new worker with a junior high school education only takes three to four months to manage the machine.

The automatic tube drawing machine greatly improves production efficiency compared to manual labor. In the past, four people working eight hours could generally only draw seventy to eighty kilograms, but the automatic tube drawing machine only requires three people and can draw more than 1,700 kilograms in eight hours. Generally, one ton of coal can only melt one ton of glass material in a factory; the furnace of the automatic tube drawing machine, however, can melt more than three tons of material with one ton of coal.

The automatic tube drawing machine is an advanced technology in the world's glass industry. Currently, the fuel used in automatic tube drawing machines in various countries is coal gas. Due to the large size of the coal gas equipment, the entire set of equipment is very complex and enormous. The Shanghai Light Bulb Factory is an old factory. If it were to adopt this complete set of automatic tube drawing equipment using coal gas as fuel, it would almost have to demolish and rebuild the factory building, which would involve a large investment and a slow process. The Shanghai Light Bulb Factory improvised by piecing together old materials, and it only took half a year to assemble the first automatic tube drawing machine using coal as fuel. The total cost was only one-fiftieth of the cost of imported coal gas tube drawing machines.

### 我国玻璃工业的重大革新  上海灯泡厂制成自动拉管机

    我国玻璃工业的重大革新
    上海灯泡厂制成自动拉管机
    据新华社上海23日电　上海灯泡厂老技工袁根宝和技师刘树棠等人合作，最近试制成功了一套自动拉管机。这是我国玻璃工业生产上一项重大的技术革新。
    这套拉管机的制成，解决了我国玻璃工业上一个长期以来没有解决的问题。过去繁重的体力劳动，使工人的体力、视力未老先衰，不到五十岁就不能再做拉管工作。培养一个熟练的拉管工人过去少则要两三年，多则要四五年。现在有了拉管机，五六十岁的老工人仍能从事拉管生产。培养一个初中毕业程度的新工人，只要三、四个月就能管这套机器。
    自动拉管机生产效率比手工劳动大大提高。过去四个人工作八小时，一般只能拉七八十公斤，自动拉管机只要三个人，八小时能拉一千七百多公斤。一般工厂一吨煤只能熔化一吨玻璃料；自动拉管机的熔炉，用一吨煤却能熔化三吨多料。
    自动拉管机是世界上玻璃工业的一项先进技术。目前各国自动拉管机用的燃料都是煤气，由于煤气设备大，全套设备也就非常复杂庞大。上海灯泡厂是个老厂，如果采用这种用煤气作燃料的全套自动拉管机，就几乎要把厂房拆掉重造才行，投资既大，时间又慢。上海灯泡厂因陋就简地用旧材料拼拼凑凑，只花半年时间，就装成了第一台用煤炭作燃料的自动拉管机，全部费用只及进口煤气拉管机的五十分之一。
