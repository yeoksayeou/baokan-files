    Dig Out Several New Rivers!
    The broad masses of Hebei Province have launched a "Report Spring" campaign, reporting a total of 500 cubic meters per second of free-flowing water that can be found in the Taihang and Yanshan mountain areas. It is said that Chengde Prefecture will dig 100,000 springs, Baoding Prefecture will find 100 cubic meters per second of water, and Ding County alone will find 30 cubic meters per second. The peasants are familiar with the mountains and geography of their hometowns. For example, the masses in five counties, including Laishui and Xushui, have reported more than 5,100 places where springs can be dug and spring sources expanded.
    Digging springs and shallow artesian wells saves more than half the labor and materials compared to drilling machine wells, and the construction period is two or three times faster. After they are dug, there is no need for water lifting tools, making irrigation really convenient.
    There are many areas in various provinces of China, like Hebei Province, where springs can be dug and artesian wells drilled. For example, there are as many as 200,000 to 300,000 square kilometers in Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the Northeast. According to the Hebei example, 5,000 to 6,000 cubic meters per second of water can be obtained, which is equivalent to digging out several new rivers from the ground. This much water is enough to irrigate 250 million mu of land, and it can also save more than 500,000 water pumps and more than 5 million horsepower of power machinery. If this is done, it can really save the state a lot of funds.
    Now Shanxi, Henan and other places have also launched this labor-saving and highly effective campaign of digging springs and drilling artesian wells. I believe that provinces with the right conditions can also launch it and can achieve it. Who says this isn’t a great thing?

### 挖出几条新河！

    挖出几条新河！
    河北省广大群众展开了“报泉”运动，一共报出在太行山和燕山地区能找出五百个秒公方的自流水。据说承德专区要挖十万眼泉，保定专区要挖出一百个水（秒公方），定县一个县要找出三十个水。农民是熟悉故乡山川地理的，例如涞水、徐水等五个县群众就报出可以挖泉和扩大泉源的地方有五千一百多处。
    挖泉、打自流井打的浅，比打机井能省一倍多的工、料，工期要快两、三倍，打好以后不用提水工具，浇地真方便。
    我国各省像河北省能挖泉、打自流井的地区很多，例如河南、山东、山西、四川、广东、内蒙古、新疆以及东北等处足有二、三十万平方公里，按河北实例估计，可以打出五、六千个水，等于从地下挖出几条新河。这样多的水足够浇二点五亿亩地，而且可以节省五十多万台水泵和五百多万马力动力机。如果这样做，真能给国家节省大量资金。
    现在山西、河南等地也都展开了这项费省、效宏的挖泉、打自流井的运动。我相信有条件的省也都一样可以展开，可以做到，谁说这不是一件大好事？
