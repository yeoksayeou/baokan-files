    Diligent Study and Hard Practice
    The cadre special class of the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications has a total of seventy-seven students. The vast majority of students are cadres above the section level who joined the revolution before 1945. The cadre special class students don't find studying political lessons too difficult, but they generally find studying mathematics and physics challenging. Many people failed their first physics exam, but they were not discouraged. When they encountered problems they didn't understand, they were not afraid of being looked down upon by others, and they consulted classmates or teachers until they understood. When Gong Hua was learning about the characteristics of geometric circles, he couldn't understand the ratio of the radius to the circumference. He drew countless circles of different sizes, and after studying hard, he finally understood. After learning optics, he tried to design and manufacture a slide projector himself. Nie Xin, deputy director of the Shandong Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, continued to study on Sundays and holidays. He had three notebooks for each course: one for notes taken in class, one for notes reorganized after class, and one for concise notes on the center and important formulas of each lesson, to be read while on the bus, walking, or before watching a movie. Now they are about to begin studying university major courses. (Zhang Huizhi)

    勤学苦练
    北京邮电学院干部特别班共有学员七十七人，绝大多数学员是1945年以前参加革命的处级以上干部。干部特别班的学员学习政治课困难还不大，学习数学、物理普遍感到吃力。不少人第一次考试物理时不及格，但他们并不气馁，遇到不懂的问题，不怕别人看不起，就请教同学或教师，一定要弄懂后才罢休。巩化在学几何圆的特性时，对半径与圆周的比弄不通，他画了无数个大小不等的圆，经过钻研，终于弄懂了。他学了光学以后，自己试着设计制造了一架幻灯机。山东省邮电管理局副局长聂鑫在星期日和假日照常学习。每门课程他都有三种笔记，一本是课堂记的，另一本是课后整理的，还有一本扼要记每课中心、重要公式，准备在乘车、走路或看电影前阅读。现在他们正要进行大学专业课的学习。（张惠之）
