    Scientific and technical terms often intimidate some comrades, who feel that only professors and experts who have studied and been educated from childhood, studied abroad, and worked in laboratories are qualified to discuss them, and that they will never be able to master them. Therefore, when it comes to science and technology, they have endless fear; in front of the bourgeois "big" intellectuals, they are often "self-deprecating." Looking at their vast knowledge, they feel like they can't do anything. This is incompatible with the style of our working people.
    This situation has begun to change recently. Many ordinary cadres and the broad masses of workers and peasants, in the struggle to transform nature, have launched a rapid advance on the natural world with their own wisdom, diligence, and energy. The victory of the broad masses of cadres and people in Tianjin Prefecture in transforming the low-lying areas is an important sign. After a short period of study and practice, they quickly mastered the complete set of skills for transforming low-lying areas, turning more than 9 million mu of waterlogged land into fertile fields, transforming historically grain-deficient areas into grain-surplus areas, and solving a major historical problem in China's agriculture. This irrefutable fact should establish a strong belief in people's minds that all minor intellectuals, and even non-intellectuals, can learn scientific knowledge and technology.
    The comrades in Tianjin Prefecture generally lacked the necessary scientific knowledge and technology at the beginning. But when they were determined to get out of the office, go deep among the masses, go deep into production, and live where they were transforming the low-lying areas to study and lead, they quickly grew. After a period of practice, they brilliantly mastered the complete set of technologies for designing water conservancy projects, improving soil, planting rice, and even managing irrigation. They have now become veritable leaders of socialist agricultural construction, qualified leaders. In the future, they will of course continue to move forward. If they are diligent in summarizing the experiences of practical struggle, and at the same time pay attention to learning from the experiences of predecessors and other provinces and countries (including reading), they are fully likely to become knowledgeable and experienced scientists and technical personnel in the future. They should completely eliminate their inferiority complex and bravely advance further.
    Of course, this does not mean that we are calling on people not to respect scientists and great intellectuals. No. Scientists and great intellectuals are the wealth of our country and people, and we should respect them and learn useful scientific knowledge from them. But this is only one aspect. There is another equally important aspect, which is that scientists and great intellectuals must integrate with the people and integrate with the people's practical struggle to transform nature. Otherwise, the speed of their scientific research will also be affected, and they will not be able to play a major role, especially in transforming nature. In the past, many people in our country specialized in agricultural science and water conservancy, but it was the ordinary workers and their cadres who had not specialized in these sciences who truly transformed the natural landscape (transforming the low-lying areas of Tianjin). This is particularly worthy of deep thought.

    不要“自惭形秽”
    田连阡
    科学和技术这类术语，时常使一些同志望而生畏，觉得好像只有那些从小到大一直上学念书、留洋和蹲实验室的教授和专门家才有资格谈论，自己则永远没有可能掌握它。因而一谈到科学技术，就具有无穷的恐惧；在资产阶级的“大”知识分子面前，常常是“自惭形秽”。看人家一大堆学问，自己好像什么都不行。这同我们劳动人民的风格是不相符的。
    这种情况，最近已开始有所转变。很多普通干部和广大工农群众，在改造自然的斗争中，以自己的智慧加上钻劲和干劲，向自然界展开了势如破竹的大进军。天津专区广大干部群众改造洼地的胜利，就是一个重要的标志。他们经过短期的学习和实践，很快地掌握了改造洼地的全套本领，使九百多万亩沥涝洼地变为良田，使历史上的缺粮区变为余粮区，解决了我国农业上一个历史性的重大问题。这个不可推翻的事实，应当在人们的脑子里树立起一个坚强的信念，就是一切小知识分子，甚至非知识分子都可以学到科学知识和技术。
    天津专区的同志们开始时一般都缺乏必要的科学知识和技术。但是当他们下决心走出办公室，深入群众，深入生产，改造哪里的洼地就住到哪里学习和领导的时候，他们就很快地长进了。经过一段实践，他们就出色地掌握了设计水利工程、改良土壤、种植水稻以至管理灌溉的全套技术。他们现在已经成了名副其实的社会主义农业建设的领导者，称职的领导者。将来，他们当然还要继续前进的。他们如果勤于总结实践斗争中的经验，同时注意学习前人的和外省外国的经验（包括读书），他们完全有可能在将来成为知识渊博而经验丰富的科学家和技术人材。他们应当彻底扫除自卑感，勇敢地前进再前进。
    当然，这里丝毫也没有号召人们不尊重科学家和大知识分子的意思。不是的。科学家和大知识分子是我们国家和人民的财富，我们应当尊敬他们，向他们学习有用的科学知识。但这只是一方面。还有同样重要的另外一方面，就是科学家和大知识分子要同人民群众结合，要同人民群众改造自然的实践斗争结合。不然，他们的科学研究工作的前进速度就也会受到影响，尤其不能在改造自然方面发挥大的作用。过去我国有许多人专门研究农业科学和水利，但真正改造自然面貌（改造天津地区洼地）的，却是并没有专门研究过这些科学的普通劳动者和他们的干部。这一点是特别值得深思的。
