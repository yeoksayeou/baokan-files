Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 7th: Japanese Socialist Party Chairman Mosaburo Suzuki asserted on April 6th that the Diet should be dissolved after debate on the no-confidence motion against the cabinet to be submitted by the Socialist Party, without waiting for a vote.

Suzuki made this statement at a press conference held in Niihama. He is beginning a speaking tour across the country.

In his remarks, Suzuki pointed out that the conservative parties have repeatedly seized power without seeking the opinions of the people, seriously undermining the basic principles of democracy. The reactionary nature of the Kishi Nobusuke government has become increasingly serious. Its foreign policy based on anti-Sovietism and pro-Americanism has run into snags everywhere, and its economic policy has caused economic recession. Kishi Nobusuke's approach of strengthening the "Self-Defense Forces" by relying on American atomic weapons has placed Japan in serious danger today. He also condemned Kishi Nobusuke's opposition to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone and his attitude of following the United States in dispatching the "Self-Defense Forces" for aggression.

Suzuki said that the Socialist Party's platform for the general election is: to base its foreign policy on the establishment of lasting world peace and to pursue independent and neutral diplomacy. It advocates issuing a declaration that Japan is a nuclear-weapon-free zone and establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones in the East and West. As one of the ways to overcome the economic recession, the Socialist Party advocates that Japan should no longer engage in one-sided trade with the United States, but should expand trade with China, the Soviet Union, and Southeast Asia. The Socialist Party also opposes economic militarization.

Kishi Nobusuke stated at the Diet session on the 7th that the government has not yet made a decision on the date for dissolving the Diet. He said that he would first make every effort to ensure that the important bills related to the 1958 budget draft are passed by the Diet before the end of April.

The prompt dissolution of the Diet and the holding of general elections has long been the unanimous call of the Japanese people. The Japanese Socialist Party is preparing to submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet around April 20th. Although Kishi Nobusuke knows that the dissolution of the Diet is an inevitable trend, he still wants to handle some outstanding foreign affairs issues before deciding on dissolution in order to salvage some political capital for himself. At the same time, although the 1958 budget draft, which serves the interests of the monopoly capitalist groups at the expense of the interests of the working people, has already been passed on March 31st, the budget itself will still be nominal if the relevant laws guaranteeing the implementation of this budget cannot be passed.

### 日本社会党委员长要求迅速解散国会  抨击岸信介政府倒行逆施

    日本社会党委员长要求迅速解散国会
    抨击岸信介政府倒行逆施
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎4月6日主张，应该在国会会议上就社会党即将提出的不信任内阁案进行辩论以后，不待表决就解散国会。
    铃木是在新居滨地方举行记者招待会时这样表示的。他正开始到全国各地进行旅行演说。
    铃木在谈话中指出，保守政党不征求国民的意见，几次轮流把持政权，严重地破坏了民主的基本原则；岸信介政府的反动性已经越来越严重，它的以反苏亲美为基础的外交政策已经到处碰壁，经济政策已经引起了经济衰退；岸信介政府依靠美国的原子武器来加强“自卫队”的作法，在今天已经使日本面临严重的危险。他还谴责岸信介反对建立无核武器地区，并且要追随美国出动“自卫队”进行侵略的态度。
    铃木说，社会党将在大选时提出的主张是：对外以建立世界持久和平为外交政策的基础，推行自主中立外交。主张发表日本为无核武器地区宣言，在东西方建立无核武器地区。作为克服经济衰退的办法之一，社会党主张日本不再同美国进行片面的贸易，要扩大同中国、苏联和东南亚的贸易。社会党并且反对经济军事化。
    岸信介7日在国会会议上表示政府对解散国会的日期尚未作出决定。他表示要首先竭力使那些同1958年度预算草案有关的重要法案在4月下旬以前在国会获得通过。
    迅速解散国会举行大选早已经是日本人民一致的呼声。日本社会党准备在4月20日前后提出不信任内阁案。岸信介虽然知道解散国会已是大势所趋，但是还想在决定解散以前处理一些外交悬案等，为他挽回一些政治资本。同时，为垄断资本集团的利益服务，而牺牲劳动人民利益的1958年度预算草案虽然已经在3月31日获得通过，但是如果保证执行这个预算的有关法案不能通过的话，预算案本身仍将有名无实。
