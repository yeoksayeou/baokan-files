    Remembering Bukittinggi
    Hu Yuzhi
    The development of the domestic war situation in Indonesia these days has aroused great concern among people. Judging from the situation in the past few days, government forces are advancing towards Bukittinggi, the last stronghold of the rebels. The Indonesian people's struggle for national independence and unity, and against colonialism, seems to be about to achieve a great victory. The imperialists' plot to create two Indonesias has been completely exposed and declared bankrupt.
    In the spring of 1941, I and a large group of cultural figures engaged in anti-Japanese work withdrew from the besieged Singapore, passed through the small island of Bengkalis off the east coast, through Siak, Pekanbaru, and finally went into exile in Payakumbuh, a small city near Bukittinggi. Now the government forces are advancing along the same route, from the east coast of Sumatra to the west coast. Seeing the news reports about the war, recalling the old events of seventeen years ago, the scenery and people are vividly remembered. Various strong feelings surged in my heart. I miss the comrades and friends who were in exile with me at that time, some of whom are no longer alive. I miss the Indonesian laborers and intellectuals, both familiar and unfamiliar, I knew. I miss the beautiful scenery of Payakumbuh and Bukittinggi. I miss the Minangkabau people's way of life and cultural life. I miss everything about the people and things, and I miss even more the eternal friendship of struggle between the Chinese and Indonesian people.
    Bukittinggi is a beautiful mountain city with a mild climate located on the equator. This city, like Kota Raja in northern Sumatra, is inseparable from the glorious history of the Sumatran people's anti-colonialist national struggle. In the first half of the nineteenth century, Tuanku Imam Bonjol, a national hero of the Bonjol region, led the Minangkabau people in a tenacious struggle against the Dutch colonial army that invaded Sumatra. Tuanku Imam Bonjol used stones, bows and arrows, and earth cannons as weapons, and defeated the well-equipped Dutch army many times, and captured Bukittinggi, a strong fortress, several times. This is the famous Padri War in Indonesian history. This anti-colonialist war lasted for sixteen years, and the Dutch mobilized all their forces to occupy western Sumatra. But the Minangkabau people never gave in. In the long history of Dutch rule in Indonesia, many national heroes, anti-colonial revolutionaries, and the earliest founders of the Indonesian Communist Party were born in the Minangkabau tribe.
    In 1942, Japanese fascists occupied the large and small islands of Indonesia. It used the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" as a cover to replace the Dutch and carry out more cruel enslavement and exploitation of the Indonesian people. Due to the strategic importance of this mountain city, the Japanese invading army set up the Supreme Command of Sumatra in Bukittinggi, but the Minangkabau people were not willing to kneel before the new tyrant. The Japanese Kempeitai headquarters stationed in Bukittinggi adopted a bloody rule, and from 1941 to 1945, it constantly arrested and killed the good people of Indonesia, using extremely cruel methods to conduct interrogation. In 1945, when the European war ended with the surrender of Nazi Germany, the Japanese army headquarters in Sumatra was prepared to fight to the death with the Allied anti-fascist forces that landed. It had already built concentration camps near Bukittinggi and planned to arrest and imprison a large number of anti-colonialist Indonesians. Because Tokyo announced its unconditional surrender, the war ended quickly, and the Japanese army's large-scale suppression plan did not materialize.
    At that time, the execution ground in Bukittinggi was not only stained with the blood of the Indonesian people, but also with the blood of the Chinese people. As far as I can remember, from 1944 to 1945, ten Chinese anti-Japanese youths were arrested for participating in the Soviet-Eastern Anti-Fascist League and the Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Association, and sent to Bukittinggi, where they were beheaded. After I returned to China, I heard that the local overseas Chinese had raised funds to build a monument to these glorious martyrs in the Bukittinggi cemetery. The people's heroes overseas will be immortal!
    I will never forget Mr. Guo Houjue. He was a senior figure in the work of writing reform and an early advocate of the Esperanto movement. He participated in anti-Japanese propaganda work during the Singapore war and later went into exile in Sumatra with us. Like most of us, he used an assumed name and maintained his life by planting vegetable gardens on a deserted island. He suffered from severe myopia and often worked in the garden wearing glasses. The Japanese Kempeitai discovered that he was an anti-Japanese intellectual, and he was escorted to Bukittinggi, where he was severely interrogated. Soon after, he contracted a serious illness and died in Bukittinggi prison.
    I can't forget Mr. Yu Dafu, who is well known in China. He was secretly executed by the Japanese Kempeitai after the Japanese army surrendered. His remains are still buried in the wilderness not far from Bukittinggi.
    In addition to the above mentioned, there were other Chinese who sacrificed on the island of Sumatra during the Japanese occupation, but I cannot tell their names. Let the dead rest in peace. War has brought endless disasters to people, but war has also brought precious fighting friendship to our two nations. The blood of the Chinese and Indonesian people is condensed on this fertile land of Sumatra, and will bloom with the flowers of peace and national friendship.
    I curse those shameless national traitors who are kept by imperialism. They will be forever spurned by the heroic and kind Indonesian people. Dear Indonesian brothers! I salute you with fighting spirit.

    回忆武吉丁宜
    胡愈之
    这些日子印度尼西亚国内战争局势的发展，引起了人们的密切关怀。从这几天的情势来看，政府军正在向叛军的最后据点山城武吉丁宜进军。印度尼西亚人民为争取民族独立统一，反对殖民主义而进行的斗争，看来就要得到一次巨大的胜利。帝国主义企图制造两个印度尼西亚的阴谋，已经完全揭露，而且宣告破产了。
    1941年春天，我和一大批文化界抗日工作者，从新加坡围城撤走，从东海岸的小岛望加丽，经过硕顶、北干巴鲁，最后流亡到武吉丁宜附近的小城市巴雅公务。现在政府军也正是沿着同一条道路，从苏岛东海岸向西海岸进军。看到报纸上所报道的战事消息，回想起十七年前的旧事，风景人物历历在目。在我的心头，涌现出各种强烈的感想。我怀念着在当时一同流亡的同志和朋友，其中有一些早已不在人世了。我怀念着我所熟识的和不熟识的印度尼西亚的劳动人民和知识分子。我怀念着巴雅公务和武吉丁宜明媚秀丽的风光。我怀念着米囊加巴族的生活习惯和文化生活。我怀念着一切的人和事，我更怀念着中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的永恒的战斗友谊。
    武吉丁宜，这是一座位置在赤道线上的气候温和的美丽的山城。这个城市和苏岛北部的哥塔拉耶一样，是和苏门答腊人民反殖民主义的民族斗争的光荣历史不能分开的。在十九世前半，庞佳尔地方的民族英雄端古·伊曼率领了米囊加巴族人民，和入侵苏门答腊的荷兰殖民军队，进行了顽强的斗争。端古·伊曼用了石块、弓箭、土炮当作武器，好多次击败了装备优良的荷兰军队，几次攻取了武吉丁宜这一座坚强堡垒。这就是印度尼西亚历史上著名的拍特利战争。这一场反殖民主义的战争，历时十六年，荷兰人动员了全部力量，才把苏岛西部占领下来。但是米囊加巴人民是从不甘心屈服的。在荷兰统治印度尼西亚的长期历史中，有不少民族英雄，反殖民主义的革命家和印度尼西亚共产党的最初创立人，都是从米囊加巴族出生的。
    1942年日本法西斯攻占了印度尼西亚的大大小小岛屿。它用“大东亚共荣圈”作为幌子，代替了荷兰人，向印度尼西亚人民进行更加残酷的奴役和剥削。由于这个山城在战略上的重要性，日本侵略军队就在武吉丁宜设立苏门答腊的最高指挥部，但是米囊加巴人民并不甘心跪倒在新的暴君的面前。驻扎在武吉丁宜的日本宪兵司令部采取了血腥统治，从1941到1945年不断地逮捕、残杀印度尼西亚的善良人们。用十分残酷的手段，进行审问。1945年，当欧洲战争由于纳粹德国的投降而结束的时候，苏岛日军司令部已准备好和登陆的反法西联军，进行殊死战，它在武吉丁宜附近已经建筑了集中营，打算把反殖民主义的印度尼西亚人民大批逮捕禁闭。由于东京宣布无条件投降，战争很快结束，日军的大规模镇压计划，才没有成为事实。
    当时在武吉丁宜刑场，还不只是流着印度尼西亚人民的血，也流着中国人民的血。单就我所能记忆的事实来说，当1944—1945年间就有十个中国抗日青年，由于参加苏东反法西斯同盟和华侨抗日协会而被逮捕，解送到武吉丁宜，以后被斩首处死。在我回国以后，听说当地华侨曾经集资，在武吉丁宜坟场，为这些光荣牺牲的烈士们建立了纪念碑。海外的人民英雄将永垂不朽！
    我永不能忘记郭后觉先生。他是文字改革工作的老前辈，也是早期的世界语运动创导者。他在新加坡战争中，参加了抗日宣传工作，后来和我们一同流亡到苏岛。他和我们中间的大部分一样，隐姓埋名，在一个荒岛上种菜园，维持生活。他患深度的近视，经常戴着眼镜在园地上劳作，被日本宪兵发觉他是抗日的知识分子，被押送到武吉丁宜，严刑逼审，不久就在武吉丁宜牢狱中得了重病牺牲了。
    我更不能忘记郁达夫先生，他是国内大家知道的，他在日军投降以后，被日本宪兵秘密处死。他的遗骨至今还埋在离武吉丁宜不远的荒郊上。
    除了上面所提到的之外，还有别的中国人，在日本占领时期牺牲在苏门答腊岛上，只是我无法道出他们的姓名。让死者安息吧。战争给人们带来了无穷无尽的灾难，但是战争也给我们两个民族带来了珍贵的战斗友谊。中国和印度尼西亚两国人民的鲜血，凝结在苏门答腊这一块肥沃的土地上，将要开出和平与民族友好的鲜花。
    我诅咒那些受帝国主义豢养的不识羞耻的民族叛徒，他们是会被英勇善良的印度尼西亚人民所永远唾弃的。亲爱的印度尼西亚兄弟们！我向你们致战斗的敬礼。
