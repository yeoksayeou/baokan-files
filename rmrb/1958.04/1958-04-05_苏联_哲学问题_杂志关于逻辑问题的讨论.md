The debate surrounding the object of logic and the relationship between logic and methods of cognition has been ongoing since the very inception of logic and continues to this day. In the 1920s, Soviet Menshevik idealists asserted that dialectics superseded formal logic; on the other hand, mechanists often replaced dialectics with formal logic in many instances. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ideologically crushed both the Menshevik idealists and the mechanists. However, even in the 1930s, a nihilistic attitude towards formal logic prevailed.

Since 1940, following the CPSU Central Committee's resolution on the necessity of studying formal logic, formal logic began to gain recognition. In 1948, the All-Union Conference of Logicians adopted a resolution condemning the nihilistic attitude towards formal logic, pointing out the need to oppose the phenomenon of formalistically detaching logic from Marxist-Leninist epistemology, and the need to study formal logic from a dialectical materialist standpoint.

In 1950-1952, a debate on logic problems unfolded in the journal "Problems of Philosophy." During the debate, two fundamentally opposing viewpoints emerged.

	(1) There are two sciences of logic: formal logic and dialectical logic. These two sciences study the same object—the laws and forms of thought—but formal logic studies them preliminarily and superficially, while dialectical logic studies them profoundly. Corresponding to these two sciences, there are two kinds of logical tools in thought itself: one peculiar to metaphysical thinking—the preliminary laws of thought, preliminary concepts, judgments, and reasoning, preliminary non-contradiction and argumentation; the other peculiar to dialectical thinking—advanced laws and concepts of thought, and so on. When a person thinks dialectically, i.e., contemplates complex problems, his thought does not have to obey the laws studied by formal logic. To assert that the thought of dialecticians also obeys the requirements of the laws of formal logic is to subordinate dialectics to formal logic. Formal logic cannot be studied from a dialectical materialist standpoint, otherwise we would arrive at a dialectical formal logic (which is absurd) and allow the confusion of formal logic with dialectical logic (dialectics).

	(2) There is one science of logic, called formal logic, or simply logic. Dialectical logic—this is one aspect of dialectical materialism used to study the dialectic of thought. Formal logic and dialectical logic have different objects: formal logic studies the laws and forms of correct thought, while dialectical logic (dialectics) studies the most general laws of the development of nature, society, and thought, or the application of these laws in the realm of thought. Formal logic is not a preliminary science. In thought itself, there exists only one logical tool—whether it is the thinking of a dialectician or the thinking of a metaphysician, it should be formally correct. The laws, concepts, judgments, and reasoning of correct thought studied by formal logic are not preliminary. Formal logic studies any form of thought, no matter how complex, but only from one aspect, namely, from the aspect of the correctness of their structure. Formal logic's study of them from this aspect is not preliminary. When a dialectician contemplates complex problems, his thought must also obey the laws studied by formal logic. And affirming this will in no way subordinate dialectics to formal logic. Because formal logic and dialectics have different objects, dialectics can never be subordinate to formal logic. Formal logic, like all other sciences (biology, physics, etc.), should be studied from the starting point of dialectical materialism, and in this case, there will be no "confusion."

The editorial board of the "Problems of Philosophy" magazine, in a concluding article on the debate (No. 6, 1951), basically agreed with the first viewpoint. Many logicians were dissatisfied with this article because it was inaccurate, unclear, and self-contradictory.

In the concluding article, formal logic was called preliminary logic. However, a little over a year later, the editorial board probably abandoned this viewpoint. In the editorial article of the first issue of 1953, it was considered that the unsatisfactory situation of logic teaching was because "there is a prevalent anti-scientific view, according to which logic is not applicable to the advanced fields of thought, and this science has no prospect of further development." And it was asserted that the problem of the relationship between formal logic and dialectical logic had long been solved by the Marxist-Leninist classics, therefore, continuing to discuss this problem was useless. However, life itself shows that this is not the case.

Thus, in the second issue of "Problems of Philosophy" in 1955, the debate on this issue began again. The editorial in this issue spoke of insufficient attention to the problems of dialectical logic because they asserted that there was no dialectical logic, only one logic (formal logic). From the context, it can be seen that the editorial board recognized the existence of two logics.

In this issue of the magazine, an article by the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the magazine, Rosenthal, was also published. Rosenthal believed that dialectical logic must be studied as an independent science. As for formal logic, in his view, no "flavor" of dialectical materialism should be allowed in it, otherwise it would "confuse formal logic with dialectical logic."

In the next issue of "Problems of Philosophy" (No. 3, 1955), an editorial was published entitled "Against Confused and Vulgarized Views on Logic Problems." In this article, the second viewpoint that emerged in the 1950-1952 debate was severely criticized. The views expressed by Bakradze in his "Logic" and the views expressed by Kondakov in his "Logic" were both criticized. The main reason these authors were accused was that they denied dialectical logic, confused formal logic with dialectical logic, replaced dialectical logic with formal logic, and canceled formal logic itself, and so on.

In the second issue of "Problems of Philosophy" in 1956, there appeared two replies from Bakradze and Kondakov to the editorial, as well as a new article from the editorial board. In this article, the editorial board still insisted on the accusations made earlier. Moreover, the authors more explicitly declared that there are preliminary forms of thought (concepts, judgments, reasoning) studied by formal logic, and there are complex forms studied by dialectical logic. In order to demonstrate this viewpoint, two articles by Alekseev and Chkesov were published in this issue.

This editorial article ended the second debate on logic in "Problems of Philosophy." However, a large number of logicians did not recognize these "errors," but instead believed that the editorial board's position was incorrect. Now the debate continues, but not in this magazine.

### 苏联“哲学问题”杂志关于逻辑问题的讨论

    苏联“哲学问题”杂志关于逻辑问题的讨论
    围绕着逻辑的对象和逻辑同认识方法的关系的争论，从逻辑一产生起就已发生，至今仍未停息。二十世纪二十年代中，苏联的孟什维克式的唯心主义者断言，辩证法扬弃了形式逻辑；而另一方面，机械主义者则在许多情形下用形式逻辑顶替了辩证法。苏联共产党在思想上既粉碎了孟什维克式的唯心主义者，也粉碎了机械主义者。但是，就是在三十年代，占上风的仍是虚无主义地对待形式逻辑。
    自1940年起，即在苏共中央关于必须学习形式逻辑的决议之后，形式逻辑开始获得了公认。1948年，在全苏逻辑学家会议上通过了决议，谴责对形式逻辑的虚无主义态度，指出必须反对形式主义地把逻辑脱离马克思列宁主义认识论的现象，以及必须从辩证唯物主义立场来研究形式逻辑。
    在1950—1952年中，“哲学问题”杂志上展开了关于逻辑问题的争论。在争论过程中，表现出两种基本上对立的观点。
      （一）有两门逻辑科学，它们是形式逻辑和辩证逻辑。这两门科学研究同一对象——思维的规律和形式，但是，形式逻辑是初步地肤浅地研究它们，而辩证逻辑则深刻地研究它们。同这两门科学相适应，在思维本身中有两种逻辑工具，一种为形而上学思维所特有——思维的初步规律，初步的概念、判断和推理，初步的不矛盾性和有论据性；另一种为辩证思维所特有的——思维的高级规律和概念，等等。当人辩证地思维时，即思考复杂问题时，他的思维不必服从形式逻辑所研究的规律。断言辩证论者的思想也服从形式逻辑规律的要求，这就是使辩证法服从于形式逻辑。不能从辩证唯物主义立场来研究形式逻辑，不然我们就会得出辩证的形式逻辑（这是荒谬的），而容许混淆形式逻辑同辩证逻辑（辩证法）了。
      （二）有这样一门逻辑科学，它叫做形式逻辑，或简称逻辑。辩证逻辑——这就是辩证唯物主义中用于研究思维辩证的一个方面。形式逻辑和辩证逻辑具有不同的对象：形式逻辑研究正确思维的规律和形式，辩证逻辑（辩证法）研究自然界、社会和思维发展的最一般的规律，或研究这些规律在思维领域中的运用。形式逻辑不是初步的科学。在思维本身中，只存在一种逻辑工具——辩证论者的思维也好，形而上学者的思维也好，都应该在形式上是正确的。形式逻辑所研究的正确思维的规律、概念、判断和推理并不是初步的。形式逻辑研究思维的任何形式，不论其如何复杂，但是只从一个方面，即从它们结构的正确性的方面来研究它们。形式逻辑从这一方面对它们的研究并不是初步的。当辩证论者思考复杂问题时，他的思维也必须服从形式逻辑所研究的规律。并且，肯定这一点完全不会使辩证法服从形式逻辑。由于形式逻辑和辩证法具有不同的对象，辩证法是决不可能服从形式逻辑的。形式逻辑同其他一切科学（生物学、物理学等）一样，也应该从辩证唯物主义出发来加以研究，在这种情况下不会有任何“混淆”。
    “哲学问题”杂志编辑部在争论的总结一文中（1951年第六期），基本上是同意第一种观点的。许多逻辑学家不满意这篇文章，因为它不确切、不明晰，并且有自相矛盾之处。
    在总结的文章中，形式逻辑被称为初步逻辑。但是，事过年余，大概编辑部就放弃了这种观点。在1953年第一期的编辑部文章中，认为不能令人满意的逻辑教学情况是因为“流行着一种反科学的观点，照它看来逻辑不适用于思维的高级领域，这门科学没有进一步发展的前途”。并且断言，形式逻辑同辩证逻辑相互关系的问题早已为马克思列宁主义经典作家解决了，因此，继续讨论这个问题是没有用的。但是，生活本身表明，情况并非如此。
    于是，在“哲学问题”1955年第二期上，又开始了关于这个问题的争论。这一期的社论中讲到对辩证逻辑的问题重视不够，因为他们断言没有任何辩证逻辑，只有一门逻辑（形式逻辑）。从前后文中可以看出，编辑部是承认有两门逻辑的。
    在这一期杂志中，还刊载了杂志副总编辑罗森塔尔的文章。罗森塔尔认为，必须把辩证逻辑当作一门独立的科学加以研究。至于形式逻辑，照他的观点看来，不容许其中有任何辩证唯物主义的“气味”，不然就会“把形式逻辑同辩证逻辑混为一谈”了。
    在“哲学问题”的下一期（1955年第三期）中，刊载了一篇编辑部的专论“反对对逻辑问题的混乱看法和庸俗化”。在这篇文章中，1950—1952年争论中出现的第二种观点遭到了严厉的批评，巴克拉节在其“逻辑”一书中表现的观点和康达科夫在其“逻辑”一书中表现的观点都受到了批评。这些作者被指责的主要原因是，他们否认了辩证逻辑，把形式逻辑同辩证逻辑混淆在一起，用形式逻辑来顶替辩证逻辑，取消了形式逻辑本身，等等。
    在“哲学问题”1956年第二期中，出现了巴克拉节和康达科夫对编辑部专论的两篇答复，也登载了编辑部的一篇新的文章。编辑部在这篇文章中，仍坚持早先所做的指责。并且，作者更明确地宣称，有形式逻辑所研究的初步的思维形式（概念、判断、推理），还有辩证逻辑所研究的复杂形式。为了论证这种观点，在这一期中刊载了阿列克谢也夫和契凯索夫的两篇文章。
    编辑部的这篇文章结束了“哲学问题”上关于逻辑的第二次争论。但是，很大一部分逻辑学家并不承认这些“错误”，反而认为编辑部的立场是不正确的。现在争论仍继续着，只是不在这个杂志上进行罢了。
