Strange Chop

On the evening of March 20th, a customer came to the Guangzhou Second Seal Production Group, claiming he wanted to have a seal engraved. When the engraver took the paper and pen, he wrote the following: ⌒船民 (⌒Boat People).

"‘Boat People’? Someone's name is that? Huh, why is there a ⌒ symbol on the name?” Doubt filled the engraver's mind.

The next morning, around nine o'clock, this customer walked out of the seal shop excitedly and immediately stamped the newly engraved seal on a small red book. But at this moment, he was stopped by a public security officer beside the road. The public security officer asked him to produce his identification. On a trade union certificate filled out for "Comrade Yin Gan," there was a seal of the "Qingyuan Boat People Association," but the red ink of the words "Boat People" stamped on the photo was very new; and the four characters "Comrade Yin Gan" also had traces of alteration.

This fellow claimed his name was Li Woyi. After repeated questioning, he finally revealed that he was staying at the Nanyuan Hotel. When they found this hotel, a check for 360 yuan was found on the floor next to the table; the name of the holder on the check was precisely Yin Gan.

Faced with the facts, Li Woyi confessed: forging the official seal and altering the trade union certificate were in order to cash this 360 yuan check at the bank.

The check belonged to a cadre named Yin Gan from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Shipping.

    奇怪的图章
    3月20日晚上，广州市第二刻章生产组来了一位顾客，声称要刻一枚图章。等刻字工人拿过纸笔时，他写下了这样的字样：⌒船民。
    “‘船民’？有叫这名字的？咦，干吗在名字上还多个⌒号呢？”疑云布满刻字工人的脑海。
    第二天早晨九点多钟，这位顾客兴冲冲地从图章店里走出来后，即刻便把刻好的图章在小红本上盖了一下。但这时，他被路旁的一位公安人员喊住了。公安人员请他拿出证明文件来。在一个填写着“尹敢同志”的工会证上，盖着“清远船民协会”的图章，但印在像片上的“船民”两字的红印很新；而“尹敢同志”四个字，也有涂改的痕迹。
    这个家伙自称叫李沃沂。经过再三诘问，才吐露出住在南园旅店。等找到这个旅店，在桌子旁边地下发现了一张支票：三百六十元；支票上持有人的名字正是尹敢。
    在事实面前，李沃沂承认：伪刻公章，涂改工会证，是为了到银行兑取这张三百六十元的支票。
    支票是广东省航运厅一个叫尹敢的干部的。
