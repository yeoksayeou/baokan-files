Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 12th: Kunming City's workers, farmers, students, cadres, and literary and musical circles are preparing to launch the "Fifteen Million Person Three Song Movement," with everyone singing these three songs: Zheng Lvcheng and Li Jianyao's "The Red Motherland Forges Ahead Courageously," Li Huanzhi and Xi Yang's "Socialism is Good," and Zhang Li and Tian Ge's "Bring Out Revolutionary Enthusiasm." In rural areas, He Wen and Wen Jin's "Love the Commune as You Love Your Home" will also be promoted. The lyrics and melodies of these songs are healthy and enthusiastic, capable of singing out the heroic spirit of the people of all ethnic groups in the Great Leap Forward.

This song movement was proposed by Kunming's music circles to inspire the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and eliminate the remnants of yellow music, and is being organized by nine units including the Yunnan Province and Kunming City Cultural Bureaus.

The Yunnan People's Publishing House has now published the "Fifteen Million Person Three Song Movement Loose-leaf Song Selection Special Edition," and the Yunnan Daily has published all four songs, including "Bring Out Revolutionary Enthusiasm." Members of the Kunming City Workers' Cultural Palace Amateur Art Troupe are practicing singing and preparing to promote the songs to grassroots trade unions. Yunnan People's Broadcasting Station is organizing broadcast singing lessons. The Yunnan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe is rushing to practice these songs and will ask the radio station to record and broadcast them. The Yunnan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Yunnan Provincial Mass Art Museum are also organizing professional musicians to go deep into factories, mines, rural areas, and schools to guide and teach the singing.

    鼓舞群众革命干劲　肃清黄色歌曲余毒
    昆明开展“十五万人三歌运动”
    新华社昆明12日电　昆明市的工人、农民、学生、干部和文学音乐界，正在筹备开展“十五万人三歌运动”，大家都来唱这三支歌：郑律成、李鉴尧的“红色的祖国奋勇前进”，李焕之、希扬的“社会主义好”，张藜、天戈的“拿出革命干劲来”。在农村还要推广河文、文进的“爱社如爱家”。这几支歌的歌词和曲调健康而热情，能唱出各族人民在大跃进中的英雄气概。
    这个歌咏运动是昆明音乐界为鼓舞群众革命干劲和肃清黄色歌曲的余毒提出倡议，由云南省、昆明市文化局等九个单位来负责组织的。
    现在云南人民出版社已出版“十五万人三歌运动活页歌选特辑”，云南日报全部刊载了“拿出革命干劲来”等四支歌。昆明市工人文化宫业余艺术团的团员们正在练唱，准备到基层工会去推广。云南人民广播电台正在组织广播教唱。云南省歌舞团正在赶练这几支歌，请电台录音后加以广播。云南省文联和云南省群众艺术馆也正在组织专业音乐工作者深入厂矿、农村和学校中去辅导教唱。
