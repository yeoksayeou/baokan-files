In the Great Leap Forward, Take the Initiative to Care for the People's Livelihood
Wan Xiangxin

Today we published news from some factories in Shanghai and the Mishi Street Non-staple Food Store in Beijing. These two pieces of news tell us that in the Great Leap Forward, we must take the initiative to care for the people's livelihood.

The current characteristics of the economic front are: advanced targets, unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, and everyone is wholeheartedly投入投into the high tide of production and construction. The past phenomena of some workers making excessive demands on wages and welfare, and haggling over personal interests, are no longer visible. Many workers have also taken the initiative to demand higher production quotas and reform excessively high and unreasonable wage and welfare systems. This is a manifestation of the further improvement of the political consciousness of workers across the country and a red flower bloomed in the rectification movement.

In this case, the leading personnel of enterprises cannot forget to care for the lives of workers because their ears are quiet and no one is making such demands. Caring for the lives of the masses is our Party's consistent style. We are neither waiting for the masses to "come to our door" before we care about their lives, nor are we simply regarding caring for the lives of the masses as a means of mobilizing them. At present, the masses have high political enthusiasm and rarely make any demands on wages and welfare. If the leading personnel further take the initiative to help workers solve problems in their lives, then the relationship between cadres and the masses will be closer; the enthusiasm of the workers will be even higher, and it will further promote the development of production.

Of course, when we say caring for the lives of the masses, we do not mean to increase wages and welfare immediately. Rather, like some factories in Shanghai, we should help workers whose families are indeed in difficulty to overcome difficulties, strengthen safety measures, and care for the health of workers. These are all things that need to be done at present.

In the current Great Leap Forward, one issue deserves special attention: in order to achieve the leap forward plan, some workers are constantly working overtime, some are neglecting sleep and food, and even rushing to work overnight. The selfless working enthusiasm of the workers is very valuable; however, excessive fatigue will affect the health of the workers and will ultimately not last. The task of the leading personnel is to be good at cherishing the enthusiasm of the masses, and be good at guiding the masses to find ways to improve labor organization, improve working methods, improve tools, and improve technology, and strive to be both brave and intelligent, rather than simply increasing labor intensity. The Mishi Street Non-staple Food Store in Beijing is doing just that.

Now, some enterprises have already seen such a situation: the attitude of the workers towards life and welfare is: thrift, thrift; the attitude of the leaders is: care, care. This situation reflects from one angle the new relationship between leadership and the led—the new relations of production—in our socialist enterprises. We hope that this relationship can be popularized to all enterprises.

### 大跃进中要主动关心群众生活

    大跃进中要主动关心群众生活
    万向辛
    今天我们发表了上海一些工厂和北京米市大街副食品商店的消息。这两条消息告诉我们：在大跃进中要主动关心群众生活。
    当前经济战线上的特点是：指标先进，广大职工积极性空前高涨，大家都一心一意地投入了生产建设高潮。过去某些职工对工资福利方面的一些过高的要求和斤斤计较个人利益的现象，看不到了。许多职工还主动要求提高生产定额，改革过高的不合理的工资福利制度。这是全国职工政治觉悟进一步提高的表现，是整风运动中开出的一朵红花。
    在这种情况下，企业的领导人员却不能因为耳边清闲，没有人提这样那样的要求，就忘记了对职工生活的关怀。关心群众生活，是我们党一贯的作风。我们既不是等着群众“找上门来”才去关心群众生活，也不是把关心群众生活仅仅当作发动群众的一种手段。目前，群众政治积极性很高，对工资福利也很少提出什么要求，如果领导人员进一步主动地去帮助职工解决生活方面的问题，那末，干部和群众的关系将会更加亲密；职工的积极性也会更加高昂，会进一步促进生产的发展。
    当然，我们说关心群众生活，并不是说要马上去增加工资福利。而是像上海一些工厂那样，帮助部分家庭生活确有困难的职工克服困难，加强安全措施，关怀职工身体健康等等，这些都是目前需要做的事情。
    在当前的大跃进中，有一个问题特别值得注意：有些职工为了实现跃进计划，不断加班加点，有的废寝忘食，连夜突击。职工们这种忘我的劳动热情，十分可贵；但是过分疲劳，会影响职工的健康，终究不能持久。领导人员的任务，是要善于珍视群众的热情，善于引导群众设法改进劳动组织，改进工作方法，改进工具，提高技术，努力做到既有勇又有智，而不是单纯提高劳动强度。北京米市大街副食品商店就正是这样做的。
    现在，有些企业已经出现了这样的局面：职工们对待生活福利的态度是：俭朴，俭朴；领导的态度是：关心，关心。这种局面，从一个角度体现了我们社会主义企业中新的领导与被领导的关系——新的生产关系。我们希望这种关系能普及到一切企业中去。
