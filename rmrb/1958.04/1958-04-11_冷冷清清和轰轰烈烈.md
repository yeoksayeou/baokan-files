Title: Coldly Quiet and Boisterously Enthusiastic

When reading Lenin's famous saying – "Communism is Soviet power plus electrification" – many people tend to think that while establishing Soviet power is certainly not easy, achieving electrification is even more difficult, especially for a poor and large country like ours. There is some truth to this view, but there is no need to mystify industrialization and electrification. The news published in this newspaper on April 9 (see front page) about the realization of electrification in most mountainous areas of Yongchun County, Fujian, and the news published today about the construction of plain hydroelectric power stations in the Tianjin Special Zone are the best proof.

The reason people mystify electrification is related to their view of socialist industrial construction. When these people talk about building power stations, they only think of Xiaofengman, Sanmenxia, and Xin'anjiang, and they look down on small power stations. Indeed, the construction of large power stations requires a lot of money, many engineering and technical personnel and workers, and it is not something that can be accomplished overnight. Therefore, in their view, it can only be done by the central government and the provinces and cities, only by people with advanced technology and culture, not by special zones, counties, townships, and cooperatives; it cannot be expected to be done by people without advanced technology and culture. This is naturally a bit mysterious. If we act according to this view, the result will inevitably be slow and quiet, truly: "How can the word 'sorrow' sum it up?"

We must never adopt this approach. Modern large factories and large power stations are the backbone of socialist industrialization, and we must vigorously build them. Medium-sized and small factories and power stations require less investment, are easier to build, and yield quick results, and we must also vigorously build them. Our policy is to combine large, medium, and small sizes; the central government builds large ones, the provinces and cities build medium ones, and the counties and townships build small ones. We must rely on experts, engineering and technical personnel, and skilled workers, but also on peasants, rural blacksmiths, carpenters, and bricklayers. In a word, the whole Party and the whole people should act together, and all levels should run industry. By implementing this policy, factories and power stations can be spread throughout urban and rural areas in a relatively short period of time with less capital. Our construction scene will not be "coldly quiet" but "boisterously enthusiastic."

Small and large, partial and whole, quantity and quality are all unified in contradiction. Without small changes, there will be no big changes; without partial changes, there will be no overall changes; without quantitative changes, there will be no qualitative changes. This is the law of development of all things. If a rural area, or even a county, builds small factories and small power stations and realizes industrialization and electrification, it is only a partial and quantitative change from the perspective of the whole country. However, when most rural areas and counties across the country have realized industrialization and electrification, it will be a qualitative change in the national situation – the realization of industrialization and electrification. Those who look down on small factories and small power stations do not understand this dialectic.

    冷冷清清和轰轰烈烈
    孔桑
    读到列宁的名言——“共产主义就是苏维埃政权加电气化”的时候，不少人往往觉得建立苏维埃政权固然不是易事，但实现电气化，却更是困难，我们这样一个又穷又大的国家，尤其如此。这种看法，是有一定道理的，但是，把工业化、电气化看得很神秘，那也不必。4月9日本报发表的福建永春县大部分山区实现电气化的消息（见一版），以及今天发表的天津专区建设平原水电站的消息，就是最好的证明。
    人们所以把电气化看得很神秘，跟他们对社会主义工业建设的看法有关。这些人谈起建设电站，就只想到小丰满、三门峡、新安江，对于小电站则看不上眼。的确，建设大的电站，就得有许多钱、许多工程技术人员和工人，也不是一朝一夕之功。所以，在他们看来，那只能由中央和省市来搞，只能由有高深技术有文化的人来搞，不能由专区、县、乡和合作社来搞；不能指望没有高深技术和文化的人来搞。这就自然有点儿神秘了。按照这种看法来办事，结果必然会是慢慢腾腾的，冷冷清清的，真是：“怎一个愁字了得？”
    我们决不能采取这个方针。现代化的大工厂、大电站是社会主义工业化的骨干，我们要大力建设。中型的、小型的工厂和电站，投资少，建设易，收效快，我们也要大力建设。我们的方针是：大、中、小型相结合；中央搞大型的，省、市、专区搞中型的，县、乡搞小型的。我们要依靠专家、工程技术人员和技术工人，也要依靠农民、农村铁匠、木匠、瓦匠。一句话，就是全党全民齐动手，各级都来办工业。执行这条方针，就能在较短的时间，花较少的资金，使工厂和电站遍布全国城乡。我们的建设景象，就不会是“冷冷清清”，而是“轰轰烈烈”的了。
    小和大，局部和整体，数量和质量，都是矛盾的统一。没有小的变化就不会有大的变化，没有局部的变化就没有整体的变化，没有量的变化就没有质的变化。这是一切事物发展的规律。一个农村，甚至一个县，建设了小工厂，小电站，实现了工业化、电气化，从全国来看，仅仅是局部的和量的变化，但是，当全国大部分的农村和县都实现了工业化、电气化的时候，就是全国的情况发生质变——实现工业化、电气化的时候。那些看不起小型工厂、小型电站的人，就不懂得这个辩证法。
