    Restore the Remittance of Royalty Fees
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications stipulated that the remittance of royalty fees would be suspended from January this year. This regulation has increased many difficulties for our county-level newspaper to send royalty fees. Because the royalty fee standard of county-level newspapers is very low, the royalty fee for an article is generally about 50 cents. If these scattered royalty fees are sent by money order, the remittance fee is more than the royalty fee. In order to solve this problem, we have contacted the county post and telecommunications bureau many times, but without effect. We suggest that the postal and telecommunications departments consider restoring the remittance of royalty fees.

    恢复稿费兑换业务
    邮电部规定从今年1月起停办稿费兑换业务。这个规定给我们县级报社寄稿费增加许多困难。因为县级报社的稿费标准很低，一篇稿子的稿费，一般是五角左右，这些零星的稿费，若用汇票寄发，汇费比稿费还多。为了解决这个问题，我们曾经向县邮电局联系多次，都没有效果。我们建议邮电部门考虑，恢复稿费兑换业务。
