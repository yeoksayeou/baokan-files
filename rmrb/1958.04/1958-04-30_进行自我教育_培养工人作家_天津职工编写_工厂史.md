Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 29th: Workers from state-owned Tianjin No. 3, 4, and 5 Cotton Textile Factories, and other factories have recently launched a creative activity of workers writing about workers and workers drawing workers. They have already collected a lot of vivid materials and have created some comic strips based on these materials.

The workers of the No. 3 Cotton Mill, who love art and literature, have preliminarily collected materials on the lives and struggles of workers from the time the factory was built in 1921 to the period of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Among them is the historical fact of the great strike in July 1925, when the workers went on strike for three consecutive months to demand wage increases from Japanese capitalists and their running dogs, and to reduce the twelve-hour workday to eight hours. They defeated the reactionary security team and big gun team, shocking the entire city of Tianjin. The No. 5 Cotton Mill also collected historical materials about workers who starved to death, died of illness, and the infants of female workers who were seized by Japanese invaders and thrown under machines to be crushed to death during the period of Japanese puppet and Kuomintang reactionary rule. In addition, these factories have collected a large number of materials on workers' inventions and creations and the improvement of labor productivity after liberation.

When the workers participating in the creation collected this batch of touching materials, many people were so excited that they shed tears, and their creative enthusiasm was surging. Workers at the No. 3 Cotton Mill have already completed 65 comic strips, including the story of the old worker, Chen Baoshu, deputy foreman of the spinning workshop, fighting against Japanese capitalists. The old worker of the No. 5 Cotton Mill, Wang Yiqing, is good at performing Ping opera. He and other workers are currently collectively creating a multi-act play reflecting the changes in workers' lives before and after liberation. The factory's writing group has also written more than a dozen poems praising the Great Leap Forward and the happy life of workers, which they plan to publish on their self-edited "Factory Wall Poetry" on May 1st Labor Day.

The Tianjin Branch of the Chinese Writers Association invited some of the heads of the factory Party committee propaganda departments who were preparing to compile "Factory History" to a meeting to specifically study this work. The meeting believed that compiling "Factory History" is a way for the working class to conduct self-education and cultivate its own writers. The Tianjin Branch of the Writers Association also proposed the establishment of a "Tianjin Factory History Editorial Committee" and, based on the actual situation of each factory that has begun compiling, suggested that state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, Tianjin Tractor Factory, etc., be the first batch of units to compile "Factory History."

    进行自我教育　培养工人作家
    天津职工编写“工厂史”
    新华社天津29日电　国营天津第三、四、五棉纺织厂等工厂的工人，最近发起工人写工人、工人画工人的创作活动。他们已经搜集了很多生动的素材，并且根据这些素材绘制了一些连环图画。
    国棉三厂爱好文艺的工人，已经初步搜集了从1921年建厂以来到国民党反动统治时期的工人生活和斗争的素材，其中有1925年7月大罢工的史实，当时工人们为了向日本资本家及其走狗要求增加工资和把十二小时的工作时间缩短为八小时，曾经连续罢工三个月，打垮了反动的保安队和大枪队，震动了全天津市。国棉五厂还搜集了工人在日伪和国民党反动统治时期饿死、病死以及女工的婴儿被日寇夺去抛入机器底下轧死的史料。此外，这些工厂还搜集了大量的工人在解放后的发明创造、提高劳动生产率的素材。
    参加创作的工人们搜集到这批可歌可泣的素材时，许多人激动得流下了眼泪，创作热情奔放。国棉三厂工人们已经绘制成了六十五幅连环图画，其中有老工人、细纱车间副工长陈宝树和日本资本家进行斗争的故事。国棉五厂老工人王义清善于演评戏，他最近和其他工人正在集体创作一个反映工人解放前后生活变化的多幕剧。这个工厂的工人创作组并已写出了十几首歌颂大跃进和工人幸福生活的诗歌，准备在“五一”劳动节时，先发表在他们主编的“工厂墙头诗”上。
    中国作家协会天津分会曾邀请一部分准备编写“工厂史”的工厂党委宣传部负责人开会，具体地研究了这项工作。会议认为：编写“工厂史”是工人阶级进行自我教育和培养自己的作家队伍的一个途径。作家协会天津分会还提议建立“天津工厂史编辑委员会”；并根据已经开始进行编写的各厂实际情况，建议由国营天津第三棉纺织厂、天津拖拉机制造厂等作为第一批编写“工厂史”的单位。
