Sediment from Rice Water Can Be Used to Make Assorted Snacks

The Harbin Electrical Machinery Manufacturing School uses five to six hundred catties of sorghum rice for each meal. In the past, the rice water was not utilized properly. Later, cook Guo Jingzhen used the sediment to make a large quantity of delicious snacks – assorted snacks. The method is as follows:

After washing the rice, take it out, and wait a few minutes for a layer of sediment to gather at the bottom of the rice water. Scoop up the sediment and sieve it, leaving the large sorghum grains and other small particles. Put the powdery sediment into a flour sack, tie the opening tightly, and place it in dry ash for about three hours. The sediment will change from thin to dry. Take out the dry sediment and mix it with white sugar and baking soda at a ratio of two catties of white sugar and eight qian of baking soda per ten catties of dry sediment. The dry sediment will become thin again due to the melting of the white sugar, so you must mix in some dry flour until the sediment hardens. Then, like rolling noodles, roll it into a large cake, and cut it into small strips about one inch long and the thickness of chopsticks. Fry them in a hot oil pan, and they become assorted snacks. If possible, coat them with sugar syrup and sesame seeds, then the color, aroma, and taste will be excellent, and they will be no less delicious than the high-quality snacks produced by food companies.

The school has already sold more than two hundred catties of this assorted snack, and the people who eat it are all satisfied. The school's dining department has calculated that using this sediment, 15,000 catties of assorted snacks can be made throughout the year, which can generate approximately 2,500 yuan in income.

    淘米水里的沉淀物可做杂拌儿
    哈尔滨电机制造学校每顿饭要用五、六百斤高粱米。那淘米水，过去都没有好好利用。后来炊事员郭景真利用其中沉淀物，做成了大量美味的点心——杂拌儿。做法如下：
    把米淘好后取出，等几分钟，淘米水底就会聚拢一层沉淀物。把沉淀物捞起来用筛子筛一下，留下大的高粱粒及别的粿粒，单把那粉糊糊的沉淀物用面袋装起来，然后扎紧袋口，放进干灰里约三个小时，沉淀物就由稀变干了，取出干沉淀物，按每十斤搭配二斤白糖、八钱苏打粉的比率，搓在一起。干沉淀物由于白糖的溶化，又变成稀的了，这就必须拌进些干面，直到沉淀物发硬为止。然后像赶面条似的，把它赶成大饼，再切成一寸多长，筷子粗细的小条，放进油锅一炸，便成了杂拌点心，如果有条件再沾上糖浆，粘上芝麻，则色、香、味三者都佳，并不亚于食品公司出品的上等美味点心。
    这种杂拌点心，全校已卖出二百多斤，吃的人都感到满意。校中膳食科统计，利用这种沉淀物，全年可做成一万五千斤杂拌，约可收入二千五百元。
