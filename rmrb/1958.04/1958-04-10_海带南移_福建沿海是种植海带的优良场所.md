Kelp Moves South
Fujian Coastal Areas are Excellent Places to Grow Kelp
Tian Zuodong, Zhang Chenyan

Kelp is originally a marine plant that grows in subarctic regions. In the winter of 1956, Fujian Province transported two batches of kelp seedlings from Qingdao. After a year of testing in the Xiaocheng sea area of Lianjiang County, the results were good. The average daily growth rate of kelp was as high as 3 centimeters or more, generally around 2 centimeters; the longest length was over 3 meters, generally 2.5 meters; the width was 22 centimeters; the thickness was 3 millimeters; the best drying ratio was 4.5:1, and generally 6.5:1; the product quality met commercial standards. This spring, more than one million kelp seedlings were transported from Dalian and Qingdao to conduct multi-point trials in four sea areas: Pingtan, Lianjiang, Xiapu, and Xiamen. The results were also very good, especially in the Dong'an sea area of Xiapu County, where the seawater is fertile and the nitrogen content is high. The maximum daily growth length of kelp reached 4.6 centimeters, greatly exceeding the highest level in last year's trial planting, which is also rare in other parts of the country.

Fujian Province is located in the southeast of the motherland, in the subtropical zone, with a warm climate, sufficient sunshine, fertile water quality, smooth tides, winding harbors, and a coastline of 2,841 kilometers, which is a unique place for the reproduction of marine algae. There are more than ten large and excellent inner bays along the coast, such as Shacheng Bay, Sandu Ao, and Xiamen Port. According to preliminary investigations, the water surface available for kelp farming in these inner bays is more than 300,000 mu. According to seawater analysis, the nitrogen content per cubic meter of seawater in the coastal areas of Fujian is 80 to 160 milligrams, which is more than three times higher than that of Qingdao and Dalian, so kelp grows particularly fast. Although Fujian Province is located in the subtropical zone and has high temperatures in summer and autumn, the coastal water temperature of 8 to 17 degrees Celsius lasts for about five months (from late November to late April of the following year), which can basically meet the time required for kelp growth. In terms of mineral nutrition, such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, and other elements, the reserves in the ocean of Fujian Province are also very rich. Even if some elements (such as nitrogen) gradually decrease due to dense kelp, the seawater is flowing, and the missing elements can be continuously replenished. As for the materials needed for kelp production, such as moso bamboo, palm chips, and straw ropes, they can also be met. All these provide favorable conditions for the development of kelp production.

Kelp is a nutritious and common non-staple food, and people in mountainous areas and border guards are particularly interested in kelp food. Because inland foods generally lack the iodine necessary for human nutrition, it is easy to develop goiter, that is, "big neck" disease. However, kelp contains a large amount of iodine, which can reach one-five-hundredth of the dry product in most cases. Therefore, eating some kelp regularly will prevent "big neck" disease.

The area available for kelp farming in Fujian Province is at least 300,000 mu. If the yield per mu is calculated at 160 dan, the annual output of fresh kelp is 48 million dan if all 300,000 mu are utilized. If the output value per dan of fresh kelp is 12.5 yuan, the output value per mu is 2,000 yuan, and the total annual output value of 300,000 mu reaches 600 million yuan. This output value is equal to 10 billion jin of rice, equal to the output of 10 million mu of 1,000-jin rice fields, and equal to the output value of 12 million adult pigs. From the perspective of accumulating funds for national industrialization, developing kelp farming is also of great significance—it can accumulate a large amount of funds for the country every year and save foreign exchange for importing dried kelp. Fujian Province has a large coastal population, little land, and surplus labor, and it is also urgent to develop shallow-sea aquaculture to solve their employment problems. According to preliminary estimates, if all 300,000 mu of sea surface are utilized, it can solve the employment problem of 150,000 full laborers, and the annual seasonal wage payment is about 50 million yuan, which can solve the annual life of 750,000 people.

According to the policy determined by the National Aquatic Products Work Conference this year, vigorously developing aquatic product aquaculture production is the main direction of aquatic product increase in the Second Five-Year Plan. Fujian will stock 10,000 mu of kelp this year and produce 1.6 million dan next year; by 1962, it will stock 300,000 mu of kelp and produce 48 million dan of kelp annually. After the implementation of this plan, the kelp production in Fujian Province will be more than 1,000 times higher than the current total kelp production of 40,000 dan in the country, and the production will rank first in the country.

In order to ensure the realization of the great leap forward plan for kelp production, the Fujian Provincial Aquatic Products Department plans to establish a kelp farming general farm in Fuzhou and branch farms in Jinjiang, Putian, Ningde, Lianjiang, Pingtan, and Xiamen. More than 170 kelp production technicians trained in Qingdao and within the province have been sent to various farms to guide kelp production; a survey team composed of more than 50 technicians has also set off with surveying instruments to conduct surveys on the specific conditions of harbor farming in 19 coastal counties and cities. In terms of seedling cultivation, in addition to the construction of a natural kelp seedling cultivation room in Xiamen, the province has also decided to allocate 6 million yuan to build a mechanically cooled kelp seedling cultivation room with a capacity of 2,000 tons in eastern Fujian. In order to solve the problem of 10,000 mu of kelp seedlings this year, the Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau has also sent a working group to Qingdao and Dalian to negotiate the purchase of seedlings.

    海带南移
    福建沿海是种植海带的优良场所
    田作东　张陈砚
    海带本是生长在亚寒带地区的海洋植物。1956年冬季，福建省从青岛运回两批海带幼苗，在连江县小埕海区经过一年试验，成绩良好。海带每日平均生长速度最快达三公分以上，一般在二公分左右；长度最长的有三公尺以上，一般在二公尺半；宽度有二十二公分；厚度有三公厘；制干率好的是四点五比一，一般的六点五比一；产品质量合乎商品规格标准。今春又从大连与青岛运回海带幼苗一百多万株，在平潭、连江、霞浦、厦门等四个海区进行多点试验。结果也很良好，特别是霞浦县东安海区，由于海水肥沃，含氮量高，海带日生长度最高达四点六公分，大大超过去年试种中最高的水平，也是全国其他地方所少有的。
    福建省位居祖国东南，地处亚热带，气候暖和，阳光充足，水质肥沃，潮流畅通，港湾曲折，海岸线长达二千八百四十一公里，是海洋藻类繁殖得天独厚的场所。沿海较大优良内湾有沙埕湾、三都澳、厦门港等十多处。据初步调查，这些内湾可供养殖海带的水面有三十万亩以上。根据海水分析，福建沿海每一立方公尺海水容积含氮量在八十到一百六十毫克，比青岛、大连高了三倍以上，因而海带生长特别快。福建省虽然地处亚热带，夏秋季节温度高，但是一年之中冬春两季摄氏八度至十七度的沿海水温约有五个月（11月下旬至翌年4月下旬），这么长的低温季节可基本满足海带生长所需的时间。在矿物营养方面，如钾、镁、钙等元素，福建省海洋中的存量也是很丰富的，即使有些元素（如氮）因海带密集而逐渐减少，但由于海水是流动的，缺少的元素还可不断得到补充。至于毛竹、棕片、草绳等海带生产所需的材料，也是能够满足需要的。这都为发展海带生产提供了有利条件。
    海带是一种富有营养的家常副食品，特别山区人民与边防军，对海带食品分外感到兴趣。因为内地一般食品均较缺少人体营养所必需的碘质，容易发生甲状腺肿，即“大脖子”病。而海带却含有大量的碘质，多的时候可以达到干品的五百分之一，因此，平时吃些海带就不会患“大脖子”病。
    福建省可供养殖海带的面积最少有三十万亩。每亩产量按一百六十担计算，三十万亩全部利用起来，年产鲜海带四千八百万担。每担鲜品产值以十二元五角计，每亩产值二千元，三十万亩年产值共达六亿元。这项产值等于一百亿斤稻谷，等于一千万亩千斤稻田的产量，等于一千二百万头成猪的产值。从为国家工业化积累资金来看，发展海带养殖业也有很大意义——每年可为国家积累大笔资金，同时可节省干品海带进口的外汇。福建省沿海人口多，土地少，劳动力有剩余，也迫切需要发展浅海养殖来解决他们的出路问题。初步估算，三十万亩的海面全部利用起来，可以解决十五万全劳动力的出路，每年季节性工资付出约有五千万元，可解决七十五万人的全年生活。
    根据今年全国水产工作会议所确定的方针，在第二个五年计划内，大力发展水产养殖生产是水产增产的主要方向。福建今年将放养海带一万亩，明年生产一百六十万担；到1962年要放养海带三十万亩，年产海带四千八百万担。实现这个规划后，福建省海带产量将比全国现有海带总产量四万担高出一千多倍，产量将居全国首位。
    为保证海带生产大跃进计划的实现，福建省水产部门计划在福州设立海带养殖总场，在晋江、莆田、宁德、连江、平潭、厦门设立分场。在青岛和省内前后培养的一百七十多个海带生产技术员，已经派到各场指导海带生产；由五十多个技工组成的一支勘察队亦已随带测量仪器，分头出发到沿海十九个县市进行港湾养殖具体条件的勘察。在育苗方面，除已在厦门施工兴建一座天然海带育苗室外，省里还决定拨款六百万元，在闽东地区兴建一座二千吨容量的机械降温的海带育苗室。为解决今年一万亩海带苗种问题，省水产局还派出一个工作组到青岛、大连一带洽购苗种。
