    A scene from the Belgrade ice rink. Look at the graceful skating posture of this little girl! She is the daughter of a worker, named Spaumangu Kaskalovic, and is only five years old this year. But she has already become a remarkable little girl on the ice rink. She can not only skate swiftly on the ice, but also perform ballet poses. This shows that sports in Yugoslavia are not only very common among young people or adults, but have also penetrated into children.
    Sports in Yugoslavia are very developed. The number of people participating in various sports such as football, motorcycle racing, skiing, ice skating, swimming, shooting, and cycling is increasing year by year. In 1956, 900,000 people participated in various sports, but by the end of 1957, it had exceeded one million, meaning that on average, one out of every eighteen residents participated in sports activities. Among them, the most participants were in football, with 68,538 people, and 48,000 people participated in motorcycle racing. Because Yugoslavia has many mountains and heavy snow, many people climb mountains and ski in winter. In winter, there are many people skating on the ice rink every day.

    五岁的滑冰能手
    这是贝尔格莱德冰场上出现的一个镜头。看，这个小姑娘的溜冰姿式多么优美！她是一个工人的女儿，名字叫斯鲍曼古·卡斯卡洛维奇，今年才五岁，可是她已经成为滑冰场上引人注意的小姑娘了。她不但可以在冰上滑跑如飞，而且还可以表演芭蕾舞的姿式。这说明南斯拉夫的体育运动不仅在青年或成人间非常普遍，而且已经深入到儿童中间了。
    南斯拉夫体育运动很发达，参加足球、摩托、滑雪、滑冰、游泳、射击以及自行车赛等各项体育运动的人一年比一年增加。1956年参加各项运动的为九十万人，但是到1957年底，已经超过了一百万人，就是说，平均每十八个居民中就有一个参加体育活动的人。其中参加足球运动的最多，有六万八千五百三十八人，参加摩托车比赛的有四万八千人。由于南斯拉夫山多雪厚，每到冬季，爬山滑雪的人也很多。冬天冰场上每天都有不少人在滑冰。
