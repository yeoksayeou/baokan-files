Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 30th: A lively new situation has emerged in Shanghai's capital construction, characterized by great collaboration and a great leap forward from all sides, with everyone competing to be advanced and each person offering ingenious plans. Design units have shifted from lagging behind construction in issuing drawings to providing timely drawing supplies, driving construction forward. Urban service departments have gone from not keeping up with the pace of project progress to arranging and supplying roads, water, electricity, and daily necessities wherever projects are undertaken. As a result, new records are constantly appearing on construction sites, and projects are being started and completed ahead of schedule one after another.

This year, the scale of Shanghai's capital construction exceeds any previous year in history. The total investment in capital construction by the central and local governments is equivalent to half of the total investment during the First Five-Year Plan period, with the majority used to develop local machinery, electronics, and chemical industries. This year alone, 698 new, renovated, and expanded factories are planned, including important projects that the city has never built before, such as iron smelting blast furnaces, silicon steel sheets, black iron sheets, seamless steel pipes, a 1,200-ton hydraulic press, a chemical fertilizer plant, a coking gas plant, and a plastics factory. The amount of construction and installation work has increased sharply, doubling last year's amount, and the technical requirements are high and the time requirements are urgent.

After the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the spirit of close cooperation and the overall concept of all capital construction units in Shanghai and departments related to construction have been greatly strengthened. Therefore, great collaboration from all sides has emerged everywhere, all for the purpose of accelerating project progress. For example, Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant is preparing to build a blast furnace with an annual output of 125,000 tons of pig iron. During the design phase, the construction unit proactively proposed its requirements for the design and went with the design staff to other places to study and visit the construction experience of blast furnaces, which provided many conveniences for the design department. When the drawings were still being drafted, the design department proactively informed the construction unit of general requirements, allowing the construction unit to start construction ahead of schedule. After the factory made the request, nearby agricultural producers' cooperatives cleared all 600 acres of land within a week. Road construction workers from the Municipal Engineering Bureau built a five-arch bridge in two weeks for the transportation of building materials. At this construction speed, the blast furnace project, which used to take two to three years to complete, is now estimated to be completed in just ten months.

### 各方大协作　人人出奇谋  上海今年建设进度空前的快

    各方大协作　人人出奇谋
    上海今年建设进度空前的快
    据新华社上海30日电　上海市在基本建设方面目前出现了一个四面八方大协作、大跃进、人人比先进、个个出奇谋的生动活泼的新局面。设计单位从出图落后于施工，变为图纸供应及时，带动施工；城市服务性部门从跟不上工程进展速度，变为工程做到哪里，道路、水电和日用品等事先安排供应到哪里。因此，现在工地上新纪录一个接着一个地出现；工程一个比一个提前施工和提前竣工。
    今年，上海基本建设规模超过历史上任何一年，中央和地方的全部基本建设投资相当于第一个五年计划期间投资总额的一半，其中大部分是用来发展地方机电、化学工业的。今年一年内要新建、改建和扩建的工厂有六百九十八个，其中有本市从未建设过的炼铁高炉、矽钢片、黑铁皮、无缝钢管、一千二百吨水压机、化学肥料厂、炼焦制气厂和塑料厂等重要项目。建筑安装的工作量比去年骤增了一倍，而且技术要求高、时间要求急。
    经过反浪费、反保守运动，上海市各基本建设单位以及与建设有关的部门的高度协作精神和整体观念都大大加强了。因此，到处出现了一切为了加快工程进度的四面八方的大协作。如上海第一钢铁厂正在筹建一座年产十二万五千吨生铁的高炉。在设计时，施工单位主动提出自己对设计的要求，跟设计人员一同到外地学习参观高炉的建设经验，使设计部门得到许多方便；设计部门当图纸还在描绘时，就主动把一般性的要求告诉施工单位，使施工单位可以提前施工。附近的农业生产合作社，在厂里提出要求以后，一个星期内就把六百多亩土地全部腾出来；市政工程局的筑路工人，在两个星期内便建成了一座五孔大桥，供运输建筑材料用。按照这种建设速度，过去需要两三年才能建成的高炉工程，现在估计只要十个月就可以完成。
