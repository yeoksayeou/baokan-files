Bountiful Wenshan

In these days of gentle spring breezes and welcoming spring colors, the 1.4 million people of all ethnic groups in Wenshan are singing and dancing to celebrate the establishment of the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture.

This place has extraordinarily abundant resources, but for thousands of years, the people of all ethnic groups have lived in extreme poverty. Before liberation, every area of Wenshan was ruled by big and small local tyrants. For example, Guangnan County had fourteen districts, with the so-called "Fourteen Warlords," each dominating their own territory. After liberation, the people of all ethnic groups truly became masters of their own destiny. In the past few years, the People's Government alone has invested 7.63 million yuan in various loans and water conservancy projects. There have been significant improvements and developments in grain production, social purchasing power, industrial construction, transportation, and culture and education. The days of suffering are gone forever. The total grain output in 1957 increased from more than 500 million jin in 1952 to more than 880 million jin, averaging 619 jin per person. Social purchasing power has also increased by one and a half times compared to 1952. In the past, the entire region had only one privately-owned cigarette factory with more than 30 workers. Now, there are 63 factories and mines, producing various agricultural tools, khaki cloth, wooden rice milling machines, and other supplies for the countryside. In the past, the entire prefecture had only 82 kilometers of dilapidated Kaiyuan-Wenshan highway. In the past few years since liberation, more than 850 kilometers of highways and more than 2,000 kilometers of postal routes have been built, connecting every county by car and every township by road.

In the past, this was a place where diseases were rampant, with more than a dozen infectious diseases such as malignant malaria, smallpox, and plague prevalent year-round. "If you want to go to Mengdong, first offer a spirit tablet." "If you want to go to Bo'ai, first sell your wife." "When thatch blooms and the millet is ripe, relapsing fever is like a tiger and wolf." Such sayings were widespread. After liberation, the government united traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, Western medicine doctors, and herbal medicine doctors to actively carry out prevention and treatment work. After 1953, various serious diseases were basically brought under control. The mortality rate in 1956 decreased by 97% compared to 1952. During the first Five-Year Plan period, the entire prefecture increased by more than 149,000 people. In the mass patriotic health campaign, Xichou County became a model county for the entire province. At the time of liberation, the entire prefecture had only five secondary schools with more than 500 students, and most of them were children of landlords and rich peasants. There were particularly few minority students. By 1950, there were fewer than ten minority students among the more than 500 students in Wenshan Middle School. Now, the entire prefecture has ten secondary schools with more than 5,800 students, and minorities account for 23.9%. In terms of primary schools, they have also developed from 261 in the past to 1,207, and the number of students has increased by 13.3 times.

In recent years, investigations by relevant departments have further proved that this is a "treasure land" with great development prospects. There are more than 20 million mu of virgin forests, and the timber reserves can supply the entire country for more than two years. The growth rate of trees here is almost twice as fast as in the Northeast. Medicinal materials are found almost everywhere in the mountains and fields. According to a preliminary survey in 1956, there are 279 types. Of the 38 kinds of famous and precious medicinal materials in the country, 28 are found here. Mineral resources are even more abundant.

In recent years, the changes in Wenshan have been rapid. Last winter and this spring, the entire prefecture built 900,000 mu of water conservancy, more than twice the total amount of water conservancy built in the eight years since liberation, and seven or eight times greater than the total amount built in the thousands of years before liberation. In the past, very little fertilizer was applied to crops. This year, the entire prefecture applied an average of 8,000 jin of fertilizer per mu, and some townships applied as much as 30,000 jin. In order to welcome the establishment of the autonomous prefecture, the people of all ethnic groups are even more motivated. They have proposed to increase grain production by 30%, industrial output by five times, eliminate the four pests within three years, achieve water conservancy, and make industrial output value catch up with agricultural output value; within five years, achieve 2,000 jin of grain, 157 jin of sugar, and 40 jin of vegetable oil per person. They are determined to build Wenshan into a paradise for people of all ethnic groups.

    丰饶的文山
    在这春风拂面春色迎人的日子里，文山一百四十万各族人民载歌载舞庆祝文山僮族苗族自治州的成立。
    这里有着异常丰富的资源，可是几千年来，各族人民一直过着极其贫困的生活。解放前，文山的每一个地区都为大小恶霸统治着。如广南县有十四个区，就有所谓“十四路诸侯”，各霸一方。解放以后，各族人民真正成了主人。人民政府几年来单是各种贷款和水利投资就达七百六十三万元。在粮食产量、社会购买力、工业建设、交通运输和文化教育等方面都有了显著的提高和发展。苦难的日子一去不复返了。1957年的粮食总产量已由1952年的五亿多斤提高到八亿八千多万斤，每人平均达到六百十九斤，社会购买力也比1952年提高了一倍半。过去全区只有一个三十多个工人的私营烟厂，现在已经有了六十三个厂矿，除生产各种农具外，还生产卡叽布，木制碾米机等供应农村。过去全州只有八十二公里破烂不堪的开（远）文（山）公路，解放几年来先后已修了八百五十多公里的公路和二千多公里的驿道，县县通汽车，乡乡通马路。
    过去，这里是疾病猖獗的地方，恶性疟疾，天花，鼠疫等等十余种传染病终年流行。“若要到猛洞，先把灵牌供。”“若要到剥隘、先把老婆卖”“班茅开花谷子黄，闷头摆子如虎狼”。诸如此类的口头禅到处流传。解放以后，政府团结了中医、西医、草药医，积极进行防治工作。1953年以后，各种严重的疾病基本上得到控制。1956年的死亡率已比1952年下降了97％，在第一个五年计划时期中，全州共增加了十四万九千多人。在群众性的爱国卫生运动中，西畴县并成为全省的模范县。在临解放时，全州只有五所中等学校，五百多个学生，而且多是地主富农的子弟。少数民族学生尤其少，到1950年时，文山中学五百多个学生中，少数民族学生还不满十人。现在全州已有十所中等学校，五千八百多个学生，少数民族已占23.9％。小学方面也已由过去的二百六十一所发展到一千二百零七所，学生人数则增加了十三点三倍。
    几年来，经有关部门的调查，更证明了这里还是一个很有发展前途的“宝地”。这里有二千多万亩原始森林，木材的蓄积量可供全国用两年多。而这里树木的生长速度，还差不多要比东北快到一倍。药材几乎满山遍野都有，据1956年的初步调查就达二百七十九种。全国三十八种名贵药材，这里就有二十八种。矿产更是丰富。
    几年来，文山的变化是迅速的。去冬今春全州共修了九十万亩水利，比解放八年来所修水利的总和还多一倍，比解放前几千年的总和还大七、八倍。过去种庄稼很少施肥的，今年全州平均每亩施肥八千斤，有的乡有高达三万斤的。为了迎接自治州的成立，各族人民的劲头更大了。他们提出要在今年内做到粮食增三成，工业翻五翻，三年内消灭四害，做到水利化，工业赶上农业总产值；五年内做到每人粮食二千斤，糖一百五十七斤，植物油四十斤。决心把文山建设成各族人民的乐园。
