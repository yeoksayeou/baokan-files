Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 2nd: A mass appraisal campaign in Shandong Province is about to unfold comprehensively. In order to do this work well, the four general inspection teams and eight sub-teams organized by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, with three general inspection teams led by Zhao Jianmin, Shi Zhe, and Xia Zhengnong, Secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, have already departed for various locations on March 30th to inspect work. The remaining teams will also depart within the next few days.

This inspection team bears multiple tasks; it is both an inspection team and an evaluation team, as well as a work team and a study team. The inspection and evaluation items for agriculture mainly focus on grasping measures and observing actions. Regarding measures, the main comparisons are the quantity, quality, attendance rate, work efficiency, and enthusiasm of water conservancy, fertilizer, and soil improvement efforts. The current focus is on spring sowing and wheat field management work. For industry, the main comparisons are the planning and establishment of county and township industries, the trial production of new products, inventions, and the ways in which industry serves agriculture. At the same time, work on production for disaster relief, afforestation, the "Five Cleanlinesses and Four Nos," and culture will also be combined for inspection and evaluation.

The Provincial Party Committee requires that 60% to 70% of the heads of departments and above in provincial-level organizations participate in the inspection teams. They will adopt a method of working that involves listening (to reports), seeing (on-site observation), doing (solving problems on the spot), spreading (disseminating new experiences and new farm tools), and helping (offering opinions after observation). The Provincial Party Committee requires that this production inspection month be transformed into a production sprint month. The inspection teams organized by the Provincial Party Committee should reach every county, the inspection teams of the prefectural committees should delve into the townships and communes, and the inspection teams of the county and township committees should reach every piece of cultivated land. Simultaneously, counties, townships, and communes should launch mass appraisal activities through mutual inspection to ensure the successful realization of this year's Great Leap Forward production increase targets.

In order to rapidly ignite a province-wide upsurge in the Great Inspection of Industry and Agriculture, the Provincial Party Committee convened a telephone conference and a province-wide broadcast rally for the Great Inspection of Industry and Agriculture.
