A recent issue of the "Reading" semi-monthly (formerly "Reading Monthly") published a book review by Gao Hong and Lin Yu - "Reviewing Several Works on Contradictions Among the People." The books being reviewed are: "On Contradictions Among the People in Our Country," by Wu Liping, published by People's Publishing House; "How to Correctly Understand and Handle Contradictions Among the People," by Zhou Yuanbing et al., published by Shanghai People's Publishing House; "On the Objective Origins of Contradictions Among the People in Our Country," by Zhu Maoyong, Shen Zhu, and Shen Yixuan, published by Shanghai People's Publishing House.

The book review considers "On Contradictions Among the People in Our Country" to be a book worth recommending, and also points out some of its shortcomings. The book "How to Correctly Understand and Handle Contradictions Among the People" is composed of six articles. The book review believes that it is also a readable popular work, although it also has some shortcomings. However, the article "Facing Up to and Exposing Contradictions Among the People" by Ma Junzhi contains serious errors and cannot be treated the same as the other five articles. The book review made severe criticisms of the book "On the Objective Origins of Contradictions Among the People in Our Country." The book review believes that this is a book with a rather strong right-leaning viewpoint, and that the content as a whole is shallow and rough.

    评几本阐述人民内部矛盾问题的读物
    最近出版的一期“读书”半月刊（原名“读书月报”），发表了高洪、林禹的一篇书评——“评关于人民内部矛盾的几本著作”。这些被评论的书是：“论我国人民内部矛盾”，吴黎平著，人民出版社出版；“怎样正确认识和处理人民内部矛盾”，周原冰等著，上海人民出版社出版；“论我国人民内部矛盾的客观根源”，朱懋庸、沈竹、沈以萱著，上海人民出版社出版。
    书评认为，“论我国人民内部矛盾”是一本值得推荐的读物，并且指出它的一些缺点。“怎样正确认识和处理人民内部矛盾”一书是由六篇文章组成的。书评认为，它也是一本可读的通俗读物，虽然它也存有一些缺点。但是，其中马俊芝的“正视和揭露人民内部矛盾的问题”一文，有严重的错误，不能同其他五篇文章同样看待。书评对“论我国人民内部矛盾的客观根源”一书提出了严厉的批评。书评认为，这是一本存有相当浓厚的右倾观点的书，而且就整个内容来说，也是肤浅的、粗糙的。
