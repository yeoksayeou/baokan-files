Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 18th: Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 4 used revolutionary spirit to streamline management organizations, change rules and regulations, and simplify statistical reports, solving the new problems that arose after cadres followed shifts to labor, and further advancing the factory's management work.

During the "Double-Anti" rectification campaign, the factory director and Party committee secretary personally took the lead, leading the factory's main cadres down to the workshops to cultivate "experimental plots," which was welcomed by the workers and improved production. However, because the overall management organization and work content had not changed, after the cadres went down, they were either called back to meetings above every few days, or the departments had a huge pile of report work without anyone in charge. Many cadres felt that if this continued, the "experimental plots" would not be cultivated well, the departmental work would not be done well, and following shifts to labor could not be sustained.

Based on this situation, the factory Party committee launched a discussion of this issue among all the factory's cadres. As a result of the discussion, they merged seven departments into two and merged three workshops into one. The work of planning and statistics, cost accounting, labor allocation, process operation, and product inspection, which was originally managed centrally by the departments, was fully delegated to the workshops.

More than half a month after the implementation of this reform, its advantages have become apparent. The most prominent effect is that the number of non-production personnel in the factory has been greatly reduced, and many problems that used to be solved by meetings in the departments are now directly solved through following shifts. At present, the factory's administrative management personnel and full-time cadres of the Party and mass organizations number seventy-one, accounting for only 2.6% of the total number of factory employees; 70% of the cadres can go down to the workshops for long-term shift-following work and participate in labor alongside workers, fundamentally changing the style of floating above in the past.

After the departments were streamlined and the cadres went down, many of the rules and regulations that originally constrained production, as well as repetitive and cumbersome statistical reports, immediately became useless. In recent days, all the factory's employees have launched a vigorous debate on the issues of what rules and regulations and statistical reports should be established and abolished. According to the employees' investigation, the factory has a total of 273 types of statistical reports, with 24 cadres specializing in serving these reports; there are 136 types of written cost regulations in the factory, some of which are very unreasonable. For example, repairing a floorboard in the workshop, which can be done in half an hour, requires sixteen procedures; moving a motor within the factory requires affixing sixty-three stamps, and transferring a person requires going through thirteen procedures, and so on. After discussion by the employees, the factory abolished 88% of the rules and regulations and 73% of the statistical reports. They believe that more than half of the reports submitted to higher authorities on a regular basis can also be cancelled, and if possible, the number of people serving the reports in the factory can be further reduced.

The problem that Cigarette Factory No. 4 is addressing has universal significance in other factories in Shanghai. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee recently held an on-site meeting in this factory to introduce their experience. The Municipal Party Committee requires factories in different industries in each district to boldly try, boldly innovate, and create the most favorable management organizational forms and rules and regulations for production.

### 种好试验田　管好全厂事  上海卷烟四厂解决了领导工作中的新矛盾

    种好试验田　管好全厂事
    上海卷烟四厂解决了领导工作中的新矛盾
    据新华社上海18日电　上海卷烟四厂用革命精神紧缩管理组织机构，改变规章制度，简化统计报表，解决了干部跟班劳动后出现的新问题，并使全厂管理工作向前跃进了一步。
    这个厂在双反整改中间，厂长和党委书记曾经亲自挂帅率领全厂主要干部下车间种“试验田”，工人很欢迎，生产也有改进。但是，由于整个管理组织机构和工作内容没有改变，干部下去以后，不是三天两头地被叫到上面开会，就是科室里报表工作一大堆，没有负责的人处理。很多干部感到长此下去，“试验田”种不好，科室工作也干不好，跟班劳动也无法坚持。
    工厂党委根据这一情况，发动了全厂干部来讨论这个问题。讨论结果，他们把七个科室并为两个，把三个车间并为一个，原来集中由科室管理的计划统计、成本核算、劳动调配、工艺操作和产品检验等工作，全权下放给车间管理。
    这项改革实行半个多月来，已经显示出它的优越性。最突出的效果是厂里的非生产人员大大减少，很多问题过去靠科室里开会解决，现在从跟班中就直接得到解决。目前，全厂行政管理人员和党和群众组织的脱产干部是七十一人，只占到全厂职工总人数的2.6％；70％的干部都能长期下到车间跟班工作、跟班参加劳动，根本改变了过去浮在上层的作风。
    科室精简、干部下去以后，许多原来束缚生产的规章制度和重复、繁琐的统计报表立即变为无用。近几天来，全厂职工对规章制度和统计报表的应兴应革事宜展开了大鸣大放。根据职工们的清查，全厂共有二百七十三种统计报表，有二十四名干部专门为这些报表服务；成文成本的规章制度全厂有一百三十六种，其中有些规章制度很不合理，如车间里修一块地板，半小时可以干了的事，却要经过十六道手续；在厂内搬动一只马达要盖六十三颗图章，调动一个人要办十三种手续等等。经过职工讨论，全厂废除了88％的规章制度和73％的统计报表。他们认为，定期报送上级机关的报表中，有半数以上也可以取消，如果可能，全厂为报表服务的人还可以减少。
    卷烟四厂着手解决的这个问题，在上海的其他工厂中具有普遍意义。中共上海市委最近在这个厂召开现场会议，介绍了他们的经验。市委要求各区不同行业的工厂要大胆尝试，大胆革新，创造最有利于生产的管理组织形式和规章制度。
