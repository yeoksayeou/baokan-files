Mobilizing the Masses to Investigate Problems and Drive Progress
CPC Qujing Prefectural Committee Conducts In-Depth Inspection of Spring Plowing in Yiliang County

    (Reported by this newspaper) The CPC Qujing Prefectural Committee in Yunnan Province, before the spring plowing, assisted Yongfeng Township and Xiaohe Township in Yiliang County to carry out a mass production inspection, which powerfully promoted the current production.

    Abandoning the Old Approach, Launching a Mass Inspection
    In mid-March, Shao Feng, First Secretary of the CPC Qujing Prefectural Committee, led an inspection team to conduct pilot inspections in Yongfeng Township, a relatively advanced area, and Xiaohe Township, a relatively backward area in Yiliang County. Initially, from leaders to cadres, everyone was accustomed to the old approach to inspecting production. Although they knew the purpose of the inspection was to promote production, they held an attitude of superiors inspecting subordinates, believing that the inspection was about finding problems and loopholes. Grassroots cadres and the masses also felt that the inspection team was there to find faults. Communes and teams with more shortcomings were somewhat nervous and passively awaited inspection. At this time, the Yunnan Provincial Committee instructed the inspection team by telephone to carry out mass inspections, to grasp the advanced, grasp the backward, and explained that this was a revolution in leadership methods. After repeatedly studying the Provincial Committee's instructions, the inspection team clarified that it was necessary to fully mobilize the masses, let the masses investigate and solve problems themselves, and the responsibility of the inspection team was to help Party organizations and cadres mobilize the masses. Therefore, it was decided to fundamentally change the initial approach, first helping production teams conduct inspections and appraisals, and expanding from the team inspection and appraisal to both ends, conducting household and team inspections simultaneously. The team's inspection and appraisal were led by the Party branch of the agricultural cooperative, adopting a method that combined mutual inspection and appraisal by representatives selected by each team with discussions by the masses of each team. The content included five inspections (water conservancy, fertilizer, preparatory plowing, greening, sanitation) and three comparisons (production achievements, leadership methods, creation), and specific methods, steps, and requirements for inspection and appraisal were also determined.

              On-Site Appraisal, Clear Distinction Between Right and Wrong
    The inspection team first conducted publicity and preparations among grassroots cadres and the masses. Once the new approach met the masses, the situation changed greatly, not only eliminating the tense atmosphere, but also the masses happily welcomed the inspection. The masses reflected: "In the past, spring plowing was arranged and appraised after autumn, and it was too late to solve the problems found." Especially the teams that had done well in production in the previous period but had not been discovered by the leaders, said more happily: "This time we can distinguish between black and white." Once the preparations began, the masses put forward the slogan "compare with the advanced, fill the loopholes," and each team found its own production loopholes and immediately began to remedy them. Yongfeng Cooperative found in the preparation that 60% of the flue-cured tobacco seeds had not been sown, and immediately started to sow all of them within a day and night. The small seedlings of the Fourth Team of Bao Hong Cooperative were sown late, and they realized it was wrong. They straightened out the seedling fields overnight and finished sowing the next day. Due to teams that were lagging behind for political and organizational reasons, the masses began to expose corruption and the fact that rich middle peasants had seized leadership.

    The inspection and appraisal began on the basis of full preparation, and the inspection and appraisal were divided into two steps: reporting and on-site inspection and appraisal. The report evaluation was actually an exchange of experience to understand what good things there were. In this process, the inspection team tried its best to let the masses express their opinions and let different opinions start debates, exposing contradictions in order to solve ideological problems. The Fifth Team and Sixth Team of Yongfeng Cooperative were both relatively advanced teams. The Fifth Team produced better than the Sixth Team, but the Sixth Team felt that its leadership style was good and did not admit that the Fifth Team was the most advanced. After the debate, it was clarified that the leadership style and production cannot be separated. With a good style, production should be even better, and the Sixth Team was convinced. After the report evaluation, the cadres and activists of each team formed several inspection teams to conduct mutual on-site inspection and evaluation, which was actually a visit. This was the decisive step in the inspection and evaluation. Some debates and doubts that could not be clarified during the report evaluation became clear after seeing the site. The Third Team of Bao Hong Cooperative has always been the key team of the Party branch. During the report evaluation, it claimed to be "first in water conservancy, first in fertilizer, and first in the whole cooperative." Although everyone felt that they were arrogant, they could not provide any material. During the on-site inspection, everyone measured the manure piles with a ruler and dug them open to see the quality. The result was only more than 30,000 loads of fertilizer, which was 20,000 loads less than reported. The Ninth Team, a mountainous team that had always been considered backward, had a poor fertilizer quantity, but the quality was particularly good. All of them were manure fertilizer, and one load was equivalent to two loads in the dam area. All 67 households in the team had toilets, and each toilet had a lid. Other plans were also well implemented. With such a look, the advanced and backward were very clear. Everyone agreed that the Ninth Team was advanced, and the Third Team was lagging behind. In the on-site inspection and evaluation, a method of combining key inspection and general inspection was adopted, with teams going to each other and seeing everything to eliminate dead corners. There was a team in Yongfeng Cooperative, where ten laborers had never worked since the establishment of the big cooperative. The masses called these people "black people," and even the branch secretary and cooperative director did not know about it. During this general inspection, the masses spoke out.

    Grasping Both Ends to Lead the Middle, Supporting All Advanced Things
    Whether it was a report evaluation or an on-site inspection and evaluation, it ran through the struggle between the advanced and the conservative and backward. The inspection team always adhered to the principle of grasping both ends and leading the middle from beginning to end. Within a township or cooperative, there were very few fully advanced units, but advanced things existed in large quantities, even in backward teams. Therefore, in addition to supporting advanced units, the inspection team also supported various advanced things, and universally promoted the enthusiasm of the masses. The First Team of Yongfeng Cooperative was a team with general production, but the cattle were well raised, and the cattle were covered with raincoats when it was cold; The Third Team of Bao Hong Cooperative, although there were false reports, was very active in promoting new technologies. These advantages were affirmed. Through item-by-item evaluation, advanced things were gathered together, and then after on-site summary and promotion, it persuaded and promoted the backward. Xiaohe Cooperative had 21 teams, and seven teams were lagging behind in production. These teams all wanted to improve production, but lacked methods. After listening to other people's introductions of experience, some went back overnight to make arrangements. During the inspection, the production situation had caught up with the general teams. After the evaluation, the leading organs issued red flags for challenge and response, and the masses' enthusiasm for learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced was even greater. The Third Team of Bao Hong Cooperative expressed during the challenge that it would seize the red flag after harvesting beans and sowing seedlings. On the same night, it lit gasoline lamps to grind sickles, and within two days after the evaluation, two compost piles were piled up.

    On the basis of the team inspection and evaluation, one stick was inserted to the end, and the evaluation and inspection were directly compared to the households. At this time, a method of combining report evaluation and finding evaluation was adopted, and six comparisons and one inspection were proposed, namely: comparing enthusiasm, comparing creation, comparing love for the cooperative, comparing savings, comparing pig raising, comparing sanitation, and inspecting actions. At the beginning, backbones took the lead in self-reporting and combining with everyone to find the advanced, and the self-reporting and striving for evaluation formed a heat wave, and many advanced figures and advanced deeds appeared. A household in the Fifth Team of Yongfeng Cooperative raised seven pigs by cutting mountain grass. After this deed was discovered, each team immediately sent people to buy pigs, and two teams bought 17 piglets in two days. The landlords and rich peasants were also subjected to five inspections and one evaluation, namely: inspecting law-abiding, inspecting labor, inspecting pig raising, inspecting sanitation, inspecting grain use, and evaluating transformation.

    This inspection and evaluation took a total of eight days, inspecting all agricultural cooperatives, production teams, and farmers in the two townships, focusing on inspecting winter production and preparatory plowing activities, and also inspecting the cooperative's leadership methods and management and operation. In the eight days of inspection, 110,000 loads of fertilizer were accumulated in the whole township, which was several times faster than the usual progress, and the progress of seedling sowing also increased from 42% of the plan to 77%. The inspection and evaluation of Yongfeng Township and Xiaohe Township also promoted the production of the whole county. The production and work of Yongfeng Township were relatively advanced, and its experience and existing problems were also universal. The Party general branch secretaries who participated in the inspection from various townships timely told the townships where they were located about the experience and problems found in the inspection, and then urged the inspection, setting off a new peak in production in the county. At night, the lights were on everywhere, and everyone was rushing to sow seedlings.

    发动群众查清问题带动落后
    中共曲靖地委深入宜良县检查春耕
    本报讯　中共云南省曲靖地委在春耕前，帮助宜良县的永丰乡和小河乡开展了一次群众性的生产大检查，有力地推动了当前生产。
    抛弃旧的一套，开展群众性检查
    3月中旬，中共曲靖地委第一书记邵风率领检查团到宜良县较先进的永丰乡和较落后的小河乡进行试点检查。开始，从领导到干部都习惯于旧的一套检查生产的方法，虽然知道检查目的是推动生产，但抱着上面检查下面的态度，认为检查就是找问题找漏洞。基层干部和群众，也觉得检查团是查毛病来的，缺点多的社、队，有些紧张，消极等待检查。正在这时，云南省委用电话指示检查团开展群众性检查，要抓先进、抓落后，并说明这是领导方法上的革命。检查团反复学习省委指示后，明确了必须充分发动群众，让群众自己查问题解决问题，检查团的责任在于帮助党组织和干部发动群众。于是决定根本改变起初的作法，首先帮助生产队检查评比，在队检查评比的基础上向两头展开，查户查队同时进行。队的检查评比由农业社的党支部领导，采取各队选派代表互相检查评比和各队群众讨论相结合的办法。内容是五查（水利、肥料、备耕、绿化、卫生）、三比（生产成绩、领导方法、创造），还确定了检查评比的具体作法、步骤和要求。
              现场评比，是非分明
    检查团首先分头在基层干部和群众中进行了宣传和酝酿。当新的作法一经和群众见面，情况就大不相同，不仅扫除了紧张气氛，群众反而愉快地迎接检查。群众反映：“过去是春耕布置秋后检查评比，查出问题也来不及了”。特别是前一段生产干得好而未被领导发现的队，更为雀跃地说：“这回可以分分黑白了。”一酝酿开，群众便提出了“比先进、补漏洞”的口号，各队发觉自己生产上的漏洞，马上动手补救。永丰社在酝酿中发现60％的烤烟种未撒，立即动手在一昼夜之内全部撒完。宝洪社四队小秧撒得迟，自己一看不对头，连夜整理秧田，次日撒完。由于政治组织原因落后的队，群众开始揭发了贪污和揭发了富裕中农掌握领导权等事实。
    在充分酝酿的基础上开始检查评比，检查评比又分为报评和现场查评两步。报评实际是交流经验，互相了解有哪些好东西。在这过程中，检查团尽量放手发动群众发表意见，让不同意见展开争论，暴露了矛盾，以便解决思想问题。永丰社的五队与六队都是比较先进的队，五队比六队生产好，但六队却觉得自己领导作风好，不承认五队最先进。经过辩论，明确了领导作风与生产不能分割开，作风好，生产应当更好，六队才口服心服了。报评后把各队干部和积极分子组成若干检查小组，互相进行现场查评，实际也是参观，这是检查评比中决定性的一步，好些争论、怀疑在报评时辩不清的，到现场一看就清楚了。宝洪社第三队一向是党支部的重点队，在报评时，自称“水利第一，肥料第一，全社第一。”大家虽感到他们骄傲，但是讲不出材料来。在现场检查时，大家用尺子量了粪堆，刨开看了质量，结果只有三万多挑肥，比自报的少两万挑。一向被认为落后的山区队第九队，肥料数量虽差，质量却特别好，全是人畜厩肥，一挑可顶坝区两挑，全队六十七户，家家有厕所，厕厕有盖，其它各项计划也执行得好。这样一看，先进与落后非常分明，大家公认第九队先进，三队落了伍。在现场查评中采取了重点查与普查相结合的方法，队队走到，样样看到，以消灭死角。永丰社有一个队，其中有十个劳动力自建大社以来，从没出过工，群众叫这些人为“黑人”，连支部书记、社主任都不知道，这次一普查，群众讲出来了。
    抓两头带中间，支持一切先进事物
    无论是报评或现场查评，都贯串着先进与保守落后的斗争，检查团自始至终掌握着抓两头，带中间的原则。在一个乡、社范围内，全面先进的单位是很少的，然而先进事物却大量存在，甚至在落后队里也有先进之处。因此，检查团除支持先进单位以外，还支持各种先进事物，普遍地发扬了群众的积极性。永丰社一队是生产一般的队，但是牛养得好，天冷给耕牛盖蓑衣；宝洪社三队虽有虚报现象，但是对推广新技术很积极，这些优点都被肯定。通过逐项评比，把先进事物集中起来了，再经现场的总结和推广，就说服与推动了落后。小河社有二十一个队，生产落后的有七个队。这些队都想搞好生产，但缺乏办法，听了人家介绍经验，有的连夜回去布置。在检查期间，生产情况已赶上一般队。评比结束后，又由领导机关颁发红旗进行挑战应战，群众学先进赶先进的劲头更大。宝洪社三队在挑战时表示割完豆、撒完秧夺回红旗，当晚点起汽灯磨镰刀，评比后两天内就堆起了两个堆肥。
    在队检查评比的基础上，一竿子插到底，直接评比检查到户。这时采取了报评与找评相结合的办法，提出六比一查，即：比干劲、比创造、比爱社、比节省、比养猪、比卫生和查行动。开始由骨干带头自报与大家找先进相结合，自报争评就形成热潮，出现了不少先进人物和先进事迹。永丰社五队有一家用割山草办法喂养了七口猪，这一事迹被发现后，各队立即派人出去买猪，两个队在两天内便买了十七口小猪。对地主富农也进行五查一评，即：查守法、查劳动、查养猪、查卫生、查用粮和评改造。
    这次检查评比，共花了八天时间，检查了两个乡的所有农业社、生产队和农户，着重检查了冬季生产与备耕活动，还检查了社的领导方法与经营管理。在检查的八天中，全乡积肥十一万挑，较平时进度快数倍，撒秧的进度也由占计划42％增加到77％。永丰乡和小河乡的检查评比，还推动了全县生产。永丰乡的生产、工作都比较先进，它的经验和存在的问题也带有普遍性，各乡参加检查的党总支书记把检查中发现的经验和问题及时告诉所在的乡，回去后又督促检查，在全县掀起生产的新高峰，入夜灯火四起，都是赶着撒秧的。
