    Spring Drought in North China
    Lu Wuzun
    In the North China region, about three-quarters of the annual rainfall is concentrated in the summer (June to August), precisely when the temperature is high, crops are growing vigorously, and water demand is greatest. This is a climatically advantageous feature of North China. However, on the other hand, due to the uneven distribution of annual rainfall and its excessive concentration, the amount of rain and snow in other seasons is insufficient. Especially in the spring, because there is little rain and snow in the autumn and winter of the previous year, the soil's stored moisture is already low. Additionally, the spring rain and snow are limited, while the temperature rises rapidly, and strong winds are relatively common, causing moisture to evaporate quickly without adequate replenishment. Therefore, North China is often threatened by "drought" in the spring.
    Spring drought is one of the important characteristics of the North China climate. According to estimates based on the average monthly rainfall and snowfall and temperature in Beijing during the spring, in a normal year, the soil water deficit in North China in April is 13 millimeters, in May it is 75 millimeters, and in June it is 73 millimeters. Using this standard, the percentage of months with spring drought in Beijing over the past 74 years is: April 84%; May 96%; June 91%. Although these estimated figures are not very accurate, they can roughly show the frequency and severity of spring drought in North China.
    From October of last year to February of this year, the amount of rain and snow in various parts of North China was 50%-60% less than in normal years in Beijing and Taiyuan, and about 25% less in Jinan. The amount of rain and snow in Xi'an, Zhengzhou, and Hohhot was slightly higher than in normal years, but the figures exceeding the average were not significant. In March of this year, rainfall and snowfall were abundant in southern North China, while it was still less than usual in the north. As for the situation in April and May, since we do not yet have a mature method for long-term weather forecasting, it is difficult to predict how much rainfall there will be in these two months. However, according to the analysis of historical records, the possibility of particularly heavy rainfall is not great, and the hope that the rainfall will be sufficient to compensate for the water lost to evaporation is also not high. Therefore, whether in areas where rainfall and snowfall have been slightly higher or lower in the past few months, it is necessary to take effective measures to prevent and combat drought, in order to facilitate timely spring sowing and ensure a bumper agricultural harvest this year.
    In the vast rural areas, agricultural water conservancy work is advancing at a rapid pace, but in the North China region, due to the limited amount of rain and snow in autumn and winter, these small and medium-sized agricultural water conservancy projects may not be able to fully play their role at present. There is still a need to find and expand temporary irrigation water sources to solve the current problems. On the other hand, strengthening water management and improving irrigation technology to save irrigation water is also an extremely important issue. Advanced experiences in various regions have shown that economical and rational use of irrigation water can expand the irrigated area by one to several times.

    华北的春旱
    卢鋈
    华北地区全年雨量大约有四分之三都集中在夏季（6月到8月），恰好正当温度高、农作物生长茂盛、需水最多的季节。这是华北气候上得天独厚的地方。但是另一方面，由于年雨量分配不匀，过分集中，其他季节雨雪量就很不够了。特别是春天，因为头年秋冬雨雪稀少，土壤储藏的水分原来就不多，再加上春天雨雪也有限，而温度升高快，大风又比较常见，水分迅速蒸发而得不到足够的补充。所以在华北春天常常受到“旱”的威胁。
    春旱是华北气候的重要特征之一。根据北京春季各月平均雨雪量和温度来估算，在正常年份，华北春季土壤缺水量4月份为十三毫米， 5月份为七十五毫米，6月份为七十三毫米。如果用这个标准来衡量，北京七十四年来春季旱情出现月份的百分率是：4月份84％；5月份96％；6月份91％。这种估算数字，虽然很不准确，但是也可以粗略地看出华北春旱的经常性和严重性。
    从去年10月到今年2月，华北各地的雨雪量，北京和太原比正常年份少了50％—60％；济南少了25％左右。西安、郑州和呼和浩特等地的雨雪量，却稍多于正常年份，但是超出于平均数的数字也并不大。今年3月份，华北南部雨雪较丰，北部还是比平常年份少。4月份和5月份的情况如何，由于我们到现在还没有一种成熟的长期气象预报方法，所以很难预料这两个月的雨量将有多少。不过根据历年的纪录分析，特别多雨的可能性并不大，而且要雨量多到能弥补蒸发所消耗掉的水分的希望也不多。因此无论是过去几个月雨雪量稍多或偏少的地区，都有必要采取有效措施来防旱、抗旱，以利及时进行春播，保证今年的农业大丰收。
    在广大的农村中，农田水利的工作正以飞跃的速度向前迈进，但是在华北地区由于秋冬雨雪为量不多，这些中小型农田水利工程当前还未必能全部充分发挥作用，还有找寻和扩大临时灌溉水源，以解决当前问题的必要。另一方面，加强用水管理和改进灌溉技术，节约灌溉用水也是一个极端重要的问题。各地区的先进经验都说明，灌溉用水经济合理，就可以扩大灌溉面积一倍以至于好几倍。
