Prolific Cow Mother
    —One Cow Turns into Five in Three Years
    Zhang Qiying, Tian Dezhi

In Yanjia Agricultural Cooperative, Guandao Township, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, there is a cow that has multiplied into five cows in less than three years, setting a new record for individual cattle productivity. Now these five cows are all plump, healthy, and lively. The masses believe this is a great joyous event, providing reliable evidence for the large-scale propagation of cattle in the future.

Yanjia Agricultural Cooperative, like the nearby agricultural cooperatives, previously had no habit of breeding cattle. Most of the cows raised by local farmers were never bred and remained barren for life; some did produce calves, but only every three to five years; only a very few cows produced two calves in three years. As for allowing a cow to give birth to a calf every year, or even turning one cow into five cows in three years, the masses thought this was a very difficult thing to do. In 1953, the party and government leaders of Guandao Township called on the masses to massively propagate cattle, develop agricultural and livestock production, and with the technical guidance of the animal husbandry and veterinary station, the masses began to pay attention to the propagation of cattle. In 1955, the Yanjia Village established a primary cooperative. At this time, a two-year-old (full year) cow was first bred and conceived in mid-April of that year; and on February 5, 1956, it gave birth to its first calf (female). Since then, this cow has been pregnant every year, giving birth to a calf every year. On January 26, 1957, it gave birth to its third calf. Among them, the first calf born on February 15, 1956, reached its first estrus on April 20, 1957 (fourteen months and five days) and was bred again. On February 20 of this year, it gave birth to another calf. In this way, in two years, ten months, and five days, the original cow, plus its daughter and granddaughter, totaled five cows. The timing of their breeding and calving is as follows: (attached chart)

Is it accidental that Yanjia Cooperative has managed to turn one cow into five in three years? No, they have done a lot of work in this area and have gained the following experience:

First, implement "heat breeding": The gestation period for a cow is generally about ten months. Therefore, to give birth to a calf every year, the cow must be able to conceive within two months after each calving. "Heat breeding" means breeding and conceiving within one to two months after each calving, so the time from breeding and conception to production has never exceeded one year.

Second, grasp the timing for early breeding: The first calf born to the cow was a female, which is an objective factor in creating "five heads in three years." However, if the first breeding and conception period of the heifer is too late, it will still not work. Yanjia Cooperative allowed this eldest daughter to grow to more than fourteen months old and bred her at the first estrus, which is half a year to a year earlier than the first pregnancy of ordinary cows in the area, which is one of the keys to striving for "five heads in three years." Then, will early breeding and pregnancy of the heifer affect the health of the heifer and the normal development of the calf? Yanjia Cooperative's experience tells us: as long as the animal husbandry is well managed, this problem does not exist. Now this eldest daughter is more than three feet eight inches tall, and her daughter weighed fifty-six catties twelve days after birth, which is no worse than others.

Third, strengthen feeding management: Whether a cow can normally estrus, achieve "heat breeding", and whether a heifer can develop early (first estrus) and breed and conceive early, is inseparable from the cow's own development speed, physical strength, and so on; and these are determined by the quality of feeding and management. Yanjia Cooperative has done a relatively outstanding job in this area. Their experience is: (1) Strengthen feeding after calving, supplement with millet porridge, and add salt and fennel. According to the feeding committee member Yan Desheng, feeding millet porridge can warm and strengthen the cow's body, and feeding salt and fennel can increase appetite and eat more. In this way, the cow is strong, has more milk, and the calf grows well. (2) Assign a special person to feed the cow, implement single-trough feeding, and strengthen care for the cow. For example, do not feed mixed grass within five days after birth, feed more dry alfalfa and silage in winter, often drink warm water, and feed more green grass in summer. (3) Train calves to eat grass early. After the calf is more than one month old, supplement with a small amount of cottonseed hulls, dry alfalfa, etc. After five months, it can be weaned to reduce the burden on the cow, which is good for the cow's health.

Fourth, rationally resolve the contradiction between breeding and use: Continuous calving of cows has some impact on use. However, as long as the breeding period is planned well, so that the calving period of the cow and the busy season of agricultural work are staggered, this contradiction can basically be resolved. The calving period of this cow in Yanjia Cooperative is between January and March, when there is very little livestock farm work except for pulling soil and sending manure.

The members and cadres of Yanjia Cooperative are even more enthusiastic about breeding cattle. They want to achieve "three calves in three years for one cow," "five heads in three years," and "eight heads in four years" this year (in another year, the old cow and its eldest daughter and second daughter will each give birth to a calf, totaling eight heads in four years including the previous five heads in three years), creating a new record for the great harvest of cows in the whole cooperative.

    多产的牛妈妈
    ——一头母牛三年变五头
    张其盈、田德之
    陕西渭南县官道乡阎家农业社，有一头母牛，在不足三年中增殖到五头牛，创造了个体牛的最高丰产新纪录。现在这五头牛，个个长得膘满肉肥，活泼健壮。群众认为这是一件大喜事，给今后大量增殖耕牛，提供了可靠证据。
    阎家农业社与附近农业社的情况一样，以前都没有繁殖耕畜的习惯。当地农民养的母牛大部分都是不配种而终身空着怀；有的虽然繁殖牛娃，也是隔三、五年才生一个；只有极少数的母畜是一头三年生二头。至于让一头母牛一年生一胎，甚至一头母牛三年变成五头牛，群众都认为这是很难办到的事情。1953年官道乡的党政领导，号召群众大量繁殖耕畜，发展农牧业生产，加之畜牧兽医站的技术指导，群众开始重视了耕畜的繁殖。1955年阎家村成立了初级社，这时有一头二岁（周岁）的母牛，就在当年4月中旬第一次配种受了胎；到1956年2月5日生下了第一个牛娃（母牛）。此后，这头母牛，连着一年怀一胎，一年生一个小牛，到1957年元月26日，生了第三个牛娃。其中1956年2月15日生的第一个牛娃，长到1957年4月20日（十四个月零五天）第一次发情又配上了种，到今年2月20日，又生下个牛娃。这样，在两年十个月零五天中，原来的这头母牛加上它的女儿和外孙女一共是五头牛。它们的每次配种和产仔的时间是这样的：（附图表）
    阎家社做到一头母牛三年变五头，是不是偶然的呢？不是的，他们在这一方面做过很多工作，并取得了以下经验：
    一、实行“热配”：母牛怀胎期，一般是十个月左右。因此要想做到一年生一胎，就必须让母牛在每次产仔后二个月内能够配种受胎。“热配”即每次产后一到二月就配种受胎了，所以每次由配种、受胎到生产，都没有超过一年。
    二、适时掌握提前配种：母牛所生第一个牛娃是母牛，这是造成“三年变五头”的客观因素。但是，如果小母牛第一次配种受胎期过晚仍然是不行的。阎家社让这头大女儿长到十四个多月，第一次发情时即进行配种受胎，所以，比当地一般母牛首次怀胎提前了半年到一年，这是争取“三年五头”的关键之一。那么，母牛提前配种，怀胎会不会影响母牛体质健壮和牛娃的正常发育呢？阎家社的经验告诉我们：只要母畜饲养管理得好，这个问题是不存在的。现在这头大女儿身高三点八尺多，它的女儿生后十二天，体重就达五十六斤，并不比别的差。
    三、加强饲养管理：母牛能够正常发情、做到“热配”，小母牛能够提前发身（第一次发情）与提前配种怀胎，这是与母牛本身发育快慢、体质强弱等分不开的；而这些又是决定于喂养和管理的好坏。阎家社在这一方面做的比较突出，其经验是：（1）母牛产后加强饲养，补喂糜子面粥，加喂食盐和茴香。据饲养委员阎德升说，喂糜子粥能使牛体发暖健壮，喂食盐、茴香能增加食欲，吃的多。这样母畜强壮，奶水多，小牛长的也美。（2）确定专人喂养母牛，实行单槽喂，对母牛加强照顾。如生后五天内不给吃拌草，冬天多喂干苜蓿和青贮饲料，经常饮温水，夏天多喂青草。（3）训练牛娃早吃草。在小牛长到一个多月后，即补喂少许棉子皮、干苜蓿等，到五个月后，就可断奶，以减轻母牛的负担，对母牛身体有好处。
    四、合理解决了繁殖与使役之间的矛盾：母牛连年产仔，对使役是有些影响的。但是，只要计划好配种期，使母牛产仔期和农活繁忙季节错开，这个矛盾基本上是可以解决的。阎家社的这头母牛的每次产仔期，都在1月至3月之间，这时除了拉土送粪以外，其他畜力农活很少。
    阎家社的全体社员和社干对繁殖耕畜的劲头更足了。他们今年要做到“一头母牛三年生三头”“三年变五头”“四年变八头”（再过一年，老母牛和它的大女儿、二女儿各生一头牛娃，连以前的三年五头一共是四年八头），创造出全社母畜大丰收的新纪录。
