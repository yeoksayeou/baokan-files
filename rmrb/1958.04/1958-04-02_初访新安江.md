First Visit to the Xin'an River
By Our Correspondent Liu Fan

The car traveled through the mountainous area of Jiande, Zhejiang, sometimes passing through high mountains and ridges, and sometimes winding along the Xin'an River, twisting and turning. The warm spring breeze blew the azaleas in the mountains, swaying them and emitting an intoxicating fragrance. The river below was crystal clear, and even the pebbles in the water were clearly visible. Ancient poets, when describing the scenery of the Xin'an River, wrote: "The clear stream cleanses my heart, the water color is different from all waters. May I ask, Xin'an River, why is the bottom so clear? People walk in a clear mirror, birds fly past a painted screen." Being there, it is like being in a beautiful landscape painting. When the car passed the Jiande Cangtan, another vivid and magnificent picture appeared in front of us: the towering mountains sandwiched the Xin'an River in the middle, a green river, sparkling. On both sides of this river, the high mountains have been cleaved open, and people have built clusters of sheds, erected continuous bamboo frames, countless cars dragging tails of dust, speeding on the road, trains bringing in large quantities of building materials, and fleets of ships transporting loads of fine sand and stones, countless wind drills are attacking the rocky mountains, and trolleys are running back and forth on the spiderweb-like tracks. For thirty *li* around, there was a boiling sound.

A row of sheds by the river housed the builders of the hydropower station. They include the mechanical construction team from the Guanting Reservoir, the wind drill operators and blasters from Shangyou, Jiangxi, as well as concrete workers, divers, welders, fitters, and car drivers from Huangtankou, Zhejiang, Gutian, Fujian, and Guangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places, totaling 13,500 people. Among them are heroes and models from the industrial and agricultural fronts, as well as demobilized veterans of the Volunteer Army and cadres from government agencies participating in labor training. They came to the Xin'an River from all over the country, but called themselves: "We are the Xin'an River people." In the snowy nights, they dug the foundation pits without stopping for a minute. On the mountainside, 115 meters above sea level, they relied solely on a rope, hanging there to knock open the weathered stones. In the exploration tunnels 30 meters from the bottom of the river, they breathed extremely foul air to inspect the geology and rock formations. Eight hours without eating or drinking, what does this count for to the "Xin'an River people"? Didn't they lie prone on the shuddering wind drills for more than eight hours, drilling the wind drills into the rock layer more than twelve meters deep? Didn't Tao Jian'an's group of chisel repair workers create a new national record by repairing 4,417 chisels in eight hours, instead of the original 900?

The Xin'an River is like a thorny rose, very charming and lovely, but in the rainy season, it will swallow tens of thousands of *mu* of crops and hurt the hearts of many people. Now, the heroes fighting there are truly going to make the Xin'an River beautiful, and they will turn the water of the Xin'an River into an inexhaustible source of wealth.

The Xin'an River Hydropower Station is surveyed, designed, and constructed by our own country, and the power generating equipment is also manufactured by ourselves. The installed capacity of the hydropower station is 580,000 kilowatts, which is 20 times larger than the Guanting Hydropower Station, and 15,000 kilowatts more than the largest Fengman Hydropower Station in our country. The dam of the hydropower station is equivalent to one and a half times the height of the 24-story Shanghai International Hotel. This dam will store the water of the Xin'an River in a huge reservoir. This reservoir is equal to one-third of Taihu Lake, and 3,184 times larger than the West Lake in Hangzhou. The building materials used for the hydropower station, if transported by 100 cars, would take eight years and three months to complete. The power station started excavation in April 1957, and was originally planned to generate electricity in 1961. Now the builders of the hydropower station are determined to advance the schedule by one year and generate electricity in 1960.

In the morning, I went to the construction site with Wang Xing, the secretary of the Party Committee of the Engineering Bureau and the director of the Engineering Bureau. He told me: "The state-approved investment for this power station is 468.8 million yuan. After the anti-waste campaign was launched, we reduced the actual cost of the power station to 400.384 million yuan. In this way, the investment per kilowatt-hour is only 24.5 fen, and the cost per kilowatt-hour is only 7.9 li." He paused, glanced at the high-voltage power lines densely packed on the mountain, and continued, "After the power station is completed, it will generate 1.84 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, and will be transmitted to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou and other regions through seven 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission lines. The entire Jiangnan area will be centered on the Xin'an River Power Station, forming a powerful power grid within a radius of 300 kilometers. At that time, it is difficult to estimate what role it will play in the industrial and agricultural production of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangxi and other places."

We walked forward, passed through the dam construction site, and walked to the west side of the Xin'an River, climbing high to look at the many vast basins in the winding mountains. This is the Xin'an River Reservoir. In the future, the reservoir will regulate floods, which can exempt 300,000 *mu* of farmland downstream from flood disasters. The downstream waterway, after a series of repairs, can be navigable for 100-ton passenger and cargo ships. This reservoir will also stock 26 million white carp, bighead carp, and carp, with an annual output of more than 12.6 million catties, and it is also planned to raise 100,000 ducks. Just raising fish can generate more than 1.4 million yuan in income every year.

On the way back to the Engineering Bureau, Comrade Wang Xing said to me: "The Xin'an River Hydropower Station has decided to generate electricity in 1960, which means that in three years and nine months, we will let nature provide wealth to the people. Three years and nine months, what a short time!" Later, Deputy Chief Engineer Pan Guisui told me: "Soviet expert Yulinov said here at the end of January that it would be a world record to generate electricity at Xin'an River Hydropower Station in 1960. This is absolutely true. I remember that the United States spent 40 years building the Boulder Hydropower Station in the past." Deputy Chief Engineer Pan took out a recent English magazine from the drawer and pointed to the record on it and said to me: "Take the Detro Hydropower Station on the North Suntianmen River, the fastest-built hydropower station in the United States recently, for example, it is smaller than our power station, and it also took four years and three months. We can proudly say that our speed is the fastest speed in the world today."

What is the basis for this speed? Comrade Liu Xianhui, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Engineering Bureau, answered well. He said: "The basis is six words: favorable weather, advantageous terrain, and unity of the people. The Xin'an River Power Station is located in the best temperate zone. There is no snow and ice sealing the ground in winter, and there is no scorching sun steaming in summer. The construction site can work day and night all year round. The geological conditions here are also good. In addition, with the unprecedented enthusiasm of the workers and the new style of leadership cadres participating in labor and leading production on the spot after the rectification campaign, we can guarantee this speed."

At midnight, I stood by the window, and the magnificent night scene of the Xin'an River reappeared in front of me. Strings of lights stole the light of the stars, and even the river was brightly lit. What a strong light, in the future, it will illuminate the factories, mines and fields of Jiangnan. In the national economic construction, it will emit a brilliant light. (Attached photo)

    初访新安江
    本报记者　刘凡
    汽车在浙江建德山区走着，一会儿穿过高山峻岭，一会儿又沿着新安江畔蜿蜒而上，曲折而下。和暖的春风把山间的杜鹃花吹得摇摇晃晃，散发出一股醉人的芬香。下面的江水一清见底，连水中的鹅卵石都历历在目。古代诗人在形容新安江景色时曾写过：“青溪清我心，水色异诸水，借问新安江，见底何如此，人行明镜中，鸟度屏风里。”身临其境，就像置身在美丽的山水画中。当汽车过了建德仓摊，面前又出现了一幅鲜明壮丽的图景：高插云霄的群山把新安江夹在中间，一道绿色江水，闪闪发光。就在这大江两岸，高山被劈开了，人们搭起了一丛丛工棚，竖起了连绵的竹架，数不清的汽车拖着尘土的尾巴，在公路上飞奔，火车装来大批建筑材料，成群的船只运来了满载的细沙和石块，无数的风钻机在向岩山进攻，斗车在蛛网般的轨道上往返奔驰。周围三十华里，一片沸腾的声音。
    江边一排工棚里，住着水电站的建设者们。他们有来自官厅水库的机械施工队，有江西上犹的风钻机手和放炮工，还有浙江黄坛口、福建古田和广州、上海、南京等地的混凝土工、潜水工、电焊工、钳工、汽车司机，一共一万三千五百多人。他们之中有工农业战线上的英雄、模范，也有复员的志愿军战士和参加劳动锻炼的机关干部。他们从全国各地来到新安江，却这样称呼自己：“我们是新安江人。”在风雪交加的夜里，他们一分钟也不停息地开挖基坑。在拔海一百一十五公尺的山腰上，他们仅仅依靠一根绳索，悬挂在那里敲开已经风化了的石块。在离江底三十公尺的河底探洞里，他们呼吸着极其恶劣的空气检查地质、岩层。八小时不吃饭，不喝水，这在“新安江人”，算得了什么？他们不是爬伏在抖动得使人肌肉发麻的风钻机上八个多小时，让风钻钻到十二公尺多深的岩层里去的吗？修钎工人陶健安小组的修钎速度不是由八小时修九百根次，创造了修四千四百一十七根次的全国新纪录吗？
    新安江，就像一朵带刺的玫瑰，十分妩媚可爱，但是在雨季，它却要吞啮多少万亩庄稼，刺伤多少人的心。现在，战斗在那里的英雄们真正要使新安江美丽起来了，他们将要把新安江的水变成取之不尽用之不竭的财富。
    新安江水电站是我国自己勘察、自己设计、自己施工的，发电设备也是自己制造的。水电站装机容量五十八万瓩，比官厅水电站大二十倍，比我国现在最大的丰满水电站还多一万五千瓩，水电站的拦江大坝，相当于二十四层楼的上海国际饭店一个半高。这个大坝将要把新安江的水拦储在一个巨大的水库里。这个水库等于三分之一个太湖，比杭州西湖大三千一百八十四倍。水电站所用的建筑材料，如果用一百辆汽车运输，需要八年零三个月才能运完。这座电站在1957年4月开挖，原来计划1961年发电，现在水电站的建设者们决心提前一年，在1960年就要发电了。
    早晨，我和工程局党委书记兼工程局长王醒到工地去。他告诉我：“这座电站，国家核定的投资是四亿六千八百八十万元，反浪费运动开展以后，我们把电站的实际造价降低到四亿零三百八十四万元。这样，每度电的投资只要二角四分五厘，每度电的成本只要七厘九。”他停下脚步，向那密集右山的高压电线扫了一眼，继续说：“电站建成后，每年发电十八亿四千万度，将以七条二十二万伏特的超高压输电线向上海、南京、杭州等地区送去，整个江南，将以新安江电站为中心，在方圆三百公里内组成一个强大的电力网。那时，它对江苏、浙江、上海、安徽、江西等地工农业生产将起何等作用，是难以估计的。”
    我们向前走，穿过拦江大坝工地，走到新安江西边，登高远望那弯弯曲曲的群山中许多广阔的盆地，这是新安江水库，将来水库调节洪水，可以使下游三十万亩农田免除洪水灾害。下游航道，经过一番修整，可以通航一百吨的客货轮船。这水库里还要放养二千六百万尾白鲢鱼、花鲢鱼和鲤鱼，年产一千二百六十多万斤，还计划养十万只鸭。光是养鱼，每年就可以收入一百四十多万元。
    在回工程局的路上，王醒同志对我说：“新安江水电站决定在1960年发电，那就是说，花三年零九个月时间，就要让大自然给人民提供财富了。三年零九个月，是多么短促的时间！后来，副总工程师潘圭绥告诉我：“苏联专家尤利诺夫1月底在这里说过，新安江水电站1960年发电，是打破世界纪录的。这话千真万确，记得美国过去建设波尔德水电站、曾花去四十年时间。”潘副总工程师从抽屉里拿出一本最近的英文杂志，指着上面的记载对我说：“就拿美国最近建筑得最快的一座水电站——北逊梯安门河上的第脱罗脱水电站说吧，比我们这个电站还小，也花去了四年零三个月。我们可以自豪地说：我们的速度是目前世界上最快的速度。”
    这个速度的依据在什么地方呢？工程局党委副书记刘显辉同志回答得好。他说：“依据就是六个字：天时、地利、人和。新安江电站处在最好的温带地区，冬天没有冰雪封地，夏天没有烈日蒸人，工地可以长年日夜不停工。这里的地质条件也好。再加上职工们空前的干劲，领导干部在整风后一面参加劳动，一面就地领导生产的新作风，这个速度我们是能够保证的。”
    午夜，我站在窗口，新安江上壮丽的夜景又呈现在眼前。一串一串的灯光，夺去了星星的光辉，连江水也照得亮亮的。这是多么强烈的光，将来，它要照亮江南的工厂、矿山和田野，在国家经济建设中，它要发出灿烂的光芒。（附图片）
