Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, April 17th: The Algerian National Liberation Army engaged in fierce combat with French colonial troops northwest of Omar yesterday. The day before, the two sides also clashed in the Constantine Province. According to the French military, a total of twenty-four French soldiers were killed or wounded.

The Algerian National Liberation Movement is receiving increasing support from Algerians. Reports from Tunisia say that ten young Algerian military officers who had just graduated from a military school in France have left the French army and joined the Algerian National Liberation Army. At the same time, several well-known Algerian football players in France have responded to the "call of fighting Algeria" and left France. They are preparing to organize an Algerian football team to participate in international competitions. This football team will be led by the Algerian National Liberation Front.

The French authorities are intensifying their suppression of the Algerian national movement. According to Parisian newspapers, another seven hundred French soldiers arrived at the port of Bone in Algeria on the 14th. Most of these soldiers came from Tunisia. Prior to this, France also transferred one thousand of its troops stationed in Morocco to Algeria.

French police also carried out bloody persecution against Algerians imprisoned in the "Saint-Paul" prison in Lyon. Approximately six hundred Algerians in this prison held a demonstration on the 15th. The French authorities sent a large number of police and gendarmes armed with automatic rifles, surrounded the prison, and opened fire and threw grenades at the demonstrators. As a result, approximately one hundred Algerians were injured, twenty of whom were seriously injured.

    阿尔及利亚爱国人民纷纷投奔民族斗争行列
    据新华社17日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放军昨天在奥马尔西北部同法国殖民军发生了激烈战斗。在这之前一天，双方在君士坦丁省也发生了冲突。据法军方面宣布，法军死伤共二十四人。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放运动受到越来越多的阿尔及利亚人的支持。来自突尼斯的消息说，刚刚在法国一个军事学校毕业的十个阿尔及利亚青年军官已经离开法国军队，投奔阿尔及利亚民族解放军。同时，在法国有名的阿尔及利亚足球队员若干人也响应“战斗的阿尔及利亚的号召”，离开了法国。他们准备组织阿尔及利亚足球队，参加国际比赛。这个足球队将受阿尔及利亚民族阵线领导。
    法国当局对阿尔及利亚民族运动加紧镇压。据巴黎报纸报道，14日又有七百名法军到达阿尔及利亚的崩角港。这些军人大部分是从突尼斯开来的。在这以前，法国还把它驻在摩洛哥的军队一千人调到阿尔及利亚。
    法国警察还对囚禁在里昂“圣保罗”监狱中的阿尔及利亚人进行了血腥的迫害。这个监狱中约有六百个阿尔及利亚人在15日举行了示威。法国当局就派来手持自动步枪的大批警察和宪兵，把监狱团团围住，并且向示威者开枪和扔掷手榴弹。结果约有一百名阿尔及利亚人受伤，其中有二十人伤势沉重。
