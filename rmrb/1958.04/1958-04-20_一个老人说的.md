    What an Old Man Said
    Er Dong
    In ancient times, an emperor, dressed in plain clothes, once passed by a village and saw many sparrows gathering in a field of early-sprouted wheat, feasting. Later, a farmer came out and spent a long time driving the sparrows away, but most of the tender wheat grains had already been pecked out, so the wheat could not be harvested. The farmer was so angry that he squatted on the edge of the field, silent for a long time. Later, he stood up and angrily cursed, "The emperor's golden mouth doesn't issue an order to exterminate these sparrows! I won't plant grain anymore, let's see what he eats!"

    The emperor was shocked to hear this and only turned around after watching the farmer walk away. Before him was a small river by the village, with a pool of clear water in the center. The sparrows, full of wheat, were drinking at the pool, tails twitching, very happy.

    At this moment, the emperor was furious and scolded the sparrows, "Little sparrows, you are so carefree, but my people are so annoyed by you that they don't want to plant grain anymore, how can I sit on my throne!" He returned to the palace in anger and immediately issued an order saying, "From this moment on, there shall not be a single sparrow in the world." The gods in all directions immediately cast a net from the sky, capturing all the sparrows in the world. However, just as people were rejoicing, it suddenly became dark in broad daylight, and people could not see each other. All labor in the world came to a standstill. The emperor hurriedly asked the Jade Emperor what was happening. The answer was, "The world cannot be without one thing. It is not acceptable for the world to be without sparrows." So the emperor quickly issued another order to restore the sparrows' right to exist and freedom of movement. And from then on, he never dared to disturb them again.

    The sparrows' right to exist and freedom of movement were restored, and the emperor sat on his throne. The sparrows did not bother him, and he slowly forgot about it. But the people could not help but plant grain. Planting grain meant they had to endure the sparrows. If someone planted millet or sorghum a few days earlier, and the ears sprouted a few days earlier, the sparrows would discover them and eat the ears clean (no weight left). If someone planted hemp seeds a few days later, and a lonely patch of seedlings emerged last, with the seed coats still attached, the sparrows would peck them to death before the seedlings could absorb a few breaths of fresh air. Corn and sorghum in the river滩地 ripened late, and after the slopes were harvested but this area was not yet harvested, it became a collective dining hall for the sparrows.

    The farmers had no choice but to sow seeds at the same time so that everyone's crops would sprout at the same time, evenly distributing the tribute to the sparrows. Crops by the river ripened late, so they would harvest them together with others, ripe or not, to avoid feeding the sparrows.

    How exhausting! But there was no other way.

    But unexpectedly, it was the cooperatives and socialism that could eliminate sparrows. Even more powerful than the emperor's golden mouth. During the 1956 high tide, our countryside launched a campaign to eliminate the four pests. Men and women, old and young, all joined in, beating, trapping, searching nests, and poisoning, and managed to get rid of the sparrows. That year's crops, only a few stalks by the door were pecked by the chickens, but the chickens laid many eggs! What about the share for the sparrows? All went to the people.

    The Communist Party has done many good things. In my opinion, eliminating sparrows is also a great thing. This deserves a great credit to the Communist Party. ·Street Play·

    一个老人说的
    而东
    古时候有个皇上，有一次穿便服走过一个村边，看到许多麻雀聚集在一块早出穗的小麦地里大餐。后来一个庄稼人出来费了好半天力气把麻雀都轰走了，可是鲜嫩的麦粒已经大部分被雀子啄出了水，不能收麦了。那个农民气得蹲在地头上久久地一声不响。后来站起来忿忿地骂道：“皇上老儿金口玉言，也不下个令叫这些雀子绝种！我以后就不种粮食，看他老儿吃什么！”
    皇上听得吃了一惊，眼看着农民走远了，才回过头来。眼前是一条村边小河，河心有一潭清水。那些吃饱了小麦的雀子正在潭边饮水，尾巴一翘一翘，十分高兴。
    皇上这时龙心震怒，冲着麻雀们骂道：“小小麻雀，你们倒怪自在的，可是我的百姓却叫你们弄得不想种粮食了，我的江山怎坐！”他忿忿地回到皇宫，马上就下令说：“从此时此刻起，世上不准再有一只麻雀。”四方八界的神灵一听皇上动怒，马上就撒下天罗地网，把世上所有麻雀都网走了。可是，当人们正在高兴的时候，大白天忽然暗了下来，对面不能见人。世上一切劳动通通都停止了。皇上急忙向玉皇大帝请教，问是怎么回事。回答说：“缺一物不成世界。世上没有麻雀不行。”于是皇上赶快又下令恢复麻雀的生存权和行动自由。而且从此以后再也没敢惊动它们。
    麻雀的生存权和行动自由恢复了，皇上坐在他的宝座上，并没有麻雀来扰害他，慢慢地也就忘了这回事。可是百姓却不能不种粮食。种粮食，就不能不受麻雀的气。谁家的黍子和谷子种早了几天，穗出得早了几天，麻雀发现了，就吃个穗子朝天（没份量了）。谁家的麻种晚了几天，孤零零一块麻苗最后出土，带着籽皮，麻雀不等麻苗吸上几口新鲜空气，就把它们都啄死了。河滩地的玉米、高粱晚熟，坡上收割了这里还没收割，也就成了雀子的集体大饭堂。
    庄稼人没办法，只好要下种一齐下种，以便各家的庄稼一齐出穗，平均摊派给麻雀的贡赋。河边地庄稼迟熟，就不管熟不熟跟着别人一齐收割，免得喂了麻雀。
    多么淘神啊！可就是没有办法。
    可没想到，竟是合作社和社会主义能够消灭麻雀。比皇上的金口玉言还厉害。1956年高潮，我们乡下闹除四害，男女老少齐下手，打的打，扣的扣，摸窝的摸窝，下毒的下毒，硬是把麻雀子弄得没有了。这一年的庄稼，就是门边上的给鸡啄了几根，可鸡还投了许多蛋呀！给雀子的那一份呢？都归了人。
    共产党办过不少的好事。依我说，灭雀子也算一件大好事。这得要给共产党记一大功。·街头剧·
