Accompanying them were also Zeng Yongquan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China; Ke Bonian, Chinese Ambassador to Romania; and Yu Peiwen, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

After disembarking from the plane, the distinguished guests, accompanied by Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, and Liu Huinong, Mayor of Wuhan, who came to welcome them, visited the Yangtze River Bridge.
