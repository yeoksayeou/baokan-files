Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 14th: Retired U.S. General Albert Wedemeyer admitted that U.S. aid cannot buy reliable allies. He testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee, saying that he believed that in the event of an emergency, countries receiving U.S. aid "would be reluctant allies and might carefully consider not allowing us (the United States) to use bases." His testimony was released on the 12th.

Wedemeyer also admitted that people in countries where U.S. troops are stationed resent the presence of American troops on their soil.

    魏德迈承认美援买不到可靠“盟友”
    据新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：退休的美国将军魏德迈承认，美援并不能收买到可靠的盟友。他在众议院非美活动委员会上作证说：他相信，在发生紧急情况的时候，接受美国援助的国家“将会是一些很勉强的盟国，并且可能会慎重地考虑不让我们（美国）使用基地”。他的证词是在12日发表的。
    魏德迈还承认有美军驻扎的国家的人民对美国军队驻在自己的国土上感到愤慨。
