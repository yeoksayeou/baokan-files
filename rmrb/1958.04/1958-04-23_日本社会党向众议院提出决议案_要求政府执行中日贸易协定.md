Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: The Japanese Socialist Party today submitted a resolution to the House of Representatives regarding the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The resolution demands that the government support and assist the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and its memorandum, and promptly take measures to fully implement the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

	Meanwhile, the Sino-Japanese Trade Association held its annual general meeting in Tokyo today. The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese government immediately support and assist in the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

	The resolution expressed regret over the Japanese government's attitude of obstructing the implementation of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement and the fact that the three trade groups forwarded the government's reply to the relevant Chinese parties without careful study. The resolution criticized that the Japanese government's attitude not only poses a danger of undermining Sino-Japanese trade, but also has a serious impact on the Japanese economy. The resolution demands that the Japanese government immediately revoke the reply already given to the three groups, and also requires all political parties to strive to make the Japanese government implement the Sino-Japanese trade agreement immediately.

	Representatives of 163 manufacturers belonging to the Sino-Japanese Trade Association attended the meeting.

	The meeting adopted the Sino-Japanese Trade Association's business plan for this year: to promote the trade of important goods between China and Japan in a planned way; to promote Sino-Japanese trade to contribute to China's economic construction; to promote the complete abolition of the COCOM embargo restrictions, etc.

	All participants unanimously agreed that the main task of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association in the future is: to break down the current obstacles to Sino-Japanese trade, launch a large-scale national movement until the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. Therefore, it was decided to rename the Sino-Japanese Trade Association as the "Japan-China Trade Promotion Association".

    日本社会党向众议院提出决议案
    要求政府执行中日贸易协定
    新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本社会党今天向众议院提出了关于执行第四次日中贸易协定的决议案。这项决议案要求政府对第四次日中贸易协定和备忘录给予支持和协助，并且迅速采取措施，以便完全执行第四次日中贸易协定。
    同时，中日贸易会今天在东京举行今年度会员大会。大会通过决议要求日本政府立即对第四次日中贸易协定的实施给予支持和协助。
    决议对日本政府阻挠执行日中贸易协定的态度和贸易三团体没有经过仔细研究就把政府答复转给中国有关方面表示遗憾。决议指责说，日本政府的态度不但有使日中贸易遭到破坏的危险，同时也给予日本经济以严重的影响。决议要求日本政府立刻取消已经给三团体的答复，并且要求各政党努力促使日本政府立即使日中贸易协定实施。
    中日贸易会所属会员一百六十三个厂商代表出席了大会。
    会议通过了中日贸易会今年度的事业计划：有计划地促进中日两国间重要货品的贸易；促使日中贸易能够有助于中国经济建设；促使完全撤销巴黎统筹委员会的禁运限制等。
    全体与会者一致认为中日贸易会今后的主要任务是：打开中日贸易现在的障碍，展开声势浩大的国民运动，一直到恢复中日两国邦交为止。因此决定将中日贸易会改名为“日中贸易促进会”。
