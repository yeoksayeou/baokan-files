Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 5th - The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee from March 30th to April 3rd. Based on the recent instructions from the Central Committee and the new situation since the Great Leap Forward in Hubei Province, the meeting thoroughly analyzed and studied some major issues in the current work.

The meeting emphasized that various tasks are currently in the midst of a Great Leap Forward. Leadership should be strengthened in all areas and efforts should be made to improve all tasks as much as possible. However, all work must be centered on production, especially agricultural production. The leadership focus of Party committees at all levels should primarily be on this aspect. Activities that hinder production should be reduced or postponed. The facts of recent years have proven that only in this way can we be proactive in our work and effectively promote the rapid development of industry and other sectors. Therefore, all possible measures should be taken to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, and measures should be taken to ensure a significant increase in summer crop production.

The Provincial Agricultural Production Inspection Team, led by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and including various secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee and first secretaries of various regional committees, reported on the agricultural production situation this year. Based on the production situation in dozens of counties and hundreds of townships and cooperatives that have already been inspected, the characteristics of agricultural production in the vast rural areas of Hubei Province this year are: the masses are highly motivated, enthusiastic, creative, and resourceful. A joyful scene of labor is evident everywhere. The work style of the majority of rural cadres has undergone a significant transformation, with them taking the lead in working and cultivating experimental plots, truly integrating cadres with the peasant masses, and driving peasant production. The quantity and quality of production have improved dramatically compared to any previous year. Due to the large-scale water conservancy projects carried out last winter and this spring, according to statistics from only five special districts, 4.87 million mu of dry land have been converted into paddy fields, 2.85 million mu have been converted into irrigated land, and over 10 billion dan of fertilizer have been accumulated, several times more than last year. In most counties of the Huanggang Special District, fertilizer application has reached over 400 dan per mu, and in some areas, the average has reached over 800 dan per mu. This year's summer crops are growing exceptionally well, and many wheat fields have been fertilized twice. At the same time, the "three guarantees and four assignments to the field" and "knowing the whole year early" systems are being widely promoted, and the management of cooperatives has been strengthened. All of this has created the necessary conditions for a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production this year.

However, many new problems have also emerged in the Great Leap Forward in production, which must be quickly resolved. The problems that deserve particular attention at present are: the leap forward is uneven; a very small number of backward townships and cooperatives have not yet fully mobilized, the work style of cadres in these areas has not changed or has changed very little, and production has not been energized; some production targets are set very high, but lack specific and effective measures; some cooperatives, although they have specific measures, lack sufficient subjective strength; in addition, a large number of cooperatives have not yet implemented the "three guarantees and four assignments to the field" and "knowing the whole year early" systems to the teams, etc. In particular, the contradiction between production measures and subjective strength has the greatest impact on current production. The meeting particularly emphasized that in resolving this contradiction, it is imperative that we should not and must not simply rely on increasing labor intensity. On the contrary, in the midst of the mass enthusiasm for production, the leadership should be cool-headed and the work style should be more pragmatic. We should always pay attention to the lives of the masses, pay attention to working methods, and resolutely oppose any form of coercive commandism. Only by cherishing the labor enthusiasm of the masses can we sustain this high level of enthusiasm.

The meeting believes that the key to solving the problems is to address the issue of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers. Therefore, carrying out cultural and technological revolutions has become an urgent task. The ongoing tool reform in many areas is the germination of the technological revolution. So far, eighteen counties in Hubei Province have achieved transportation vehicleization, which has played a significant role in solving the labor shortage. This reform must be vigorously promoted.

The meeting pointed out that the rural cultural and technological revolutions are not only urgently demanded by the broad masses, but also have become possible. It is entirely possible to strive to achieve a middle school in every township and an elementary school in every cooperative as soon as possible. Local industry is also entirely possible to keep up with the needs of agricultural development in a relatively short period of time. The key issue here is to implement the principle of the whole Party and the whole people running industry, and to give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses. The meeting paid particular attention to the experience of Xiaomiao Township in Tianmen County in combining cultural and technological revolutions, and the experience of Xinqiao Township in Tianmen County in the masses raising funds to run industry. Xiaomiao Township combined night schools with experimental fields, and as a result, farmers quickly achieved results in learning culture and technology. Xinqiao Township paid attention to educating farmers on thrift and household management, so that every household had savings. Recently, after proposing to run industry, this township immediately invested 280,000 yuan to build a chemical fertilizer factory. After the county promoted the experience of this township, it quickly raised more than 10 million yuan, solving the funding problem for local industry. The meeting believes that the conditions for running local industry on a large scale are now ripe, and there is basically no problem with funding. Therefore, we must break all conservative ideas in this regard. However, attention should also be paid to whether technology and equipment can keep up. If this issue is not addressed, it will also accumulate funds, cause dissatisfaction among the masses, and dampen the enthusiasm of the masses to run industry. That is to say, we should try to make subjective demands consistent with objective realities. Now we should mobilize the whole people, go all out, and at the same time make specific arrangements, build in batches and phases, and develop from low-level to high-level, from small to large. As long as we adhere to the general construction guideline of "more, faster, better, and more economical" throughout, the result of the construction will inevitably be very fast. In order to strengthen the leadership of local industry, the meeting required Party committees at all levels to learn the leadership methods of grasping agriculture with the right hand and grasping industry with the left hand. The district and county committees should send a secretary to specialize in industry.

According to the spirit of making production the center, the meeting paid particular attention to the rectification campaign as the "key link." At present, the rural rectification campaign in Hubei Province is underway. According to statistics from 7,723 agricultural cooperatives in Huanggang Special District, 26% have completed the rectification campaign. After the rectification campaign, the work and production in the areas have been completely renewed, and the number of third-category townships and cooperatives has been greatly reduced or even eliminated. However, the rectification campaign has just begun in most areas, and has not yet begun in some areas. Therefore, the rectification task is still very heavy, and the rural rectification campaign must be carried out to the end in conjunction with production. The experience of various places proves that big-character posters are also a very good weapon in the rural rectification campaign, and should be fully utilized in various places. In the rectification campaign, special attention should be paid to the transformation of backward townships and cooperatives. Through the rectification campaign, the appearance of backward townships and cooperatives should be changed, so that the Great Leap Forward in production in various regions can develop in a balanced manner.

At the same time, the meeting required all localities to first launch the first shot of the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958, seize the current spring plowing production, the management and harvesting of summer crops, and strive for a bumper harvest of summer crops. To this end, the meeting decided that agricultural inspections in various places should continue, and the focus of the inspection should be on spring plowing production and the management of summer crops. We must further resolve the conservative thinking of some people who have no confidence in increasing production and the complacent mood of "almost" that exists among some people, so as to ensure the realization of the production increase plan.

    湖北省委研究如何加强各项工作的领导
    头脑要冷静作风要踏实
    以农业生产为中心继续促进全面大跃进
    新华社武汉5日电　中共湖北省委于3月30日到4月3日召开了常委（扩大）会议，根据中央最近的指示精神和湖北省生产大跃进以来的新情况，详细分析研究了当前工作中的一些重大问题。
    会议着重指出：现在各种工作都在大跃进，对各种工作都应该加强领导，尽可能作好，但一切工作都必须以生产特别是农业生产为中心。各级党委的领导中心，首先应放在这方面。一切妨碍生产的事，都应少作或缓作。几年来的事实已经证明：只有这样，工作才能主动，才能有力地促进工业和其他工作迅速发展。因此，应该想尽一切办法，争取今年农业大丰收，要采取措施保证夏季作物大大增产。
    以中共湖北省委第一书记王任重为首有省委的各个书记和各地委第一书记参加的全省农业生产检查团，在会上汇报了今年的农业生产情况。根据已经检查过的几十个县和几百个乡、社的生产情况来看，今年湖北省广大农村生产的特点是：群众劲头大，热情高，创造多，办法好。到处洋溢着一片欢乐劳动的景象。绝大部分农村干部的作风已经有了明显转变，带头干活和种了试验田，使干部和农民群众真正打成一片，并带动了农民生产。生产数量和质量比过去任何一年都有飞跃提高。由于去冬今春大兴水利，仅据五个专区统计，旱地改水田即达四百八十七万亩，改成水浇地二百八十五万亩，积肥一百多亿担，这些都比去年增加了数倍。黄冈专区大部县的肥料达到了每亩田四百担以上，一部分地区平均每亩积肥八百多担。今年的夏收作物生长得特别好，很多小麦都追了二次肥。同时，各地普遍在推行“三包四到田”“一年早知道”，加强了合作社的经营管理。这一切都为今年农业生产大跃进创造了必要的条件。
    但是，在生产大跃进中也出现了许多新问题，必须迅速加以解决。目前特别值得注意的问题是：跃进不平衡，仍有很少一部分落后乡、社还没完全行动起来，这些地区的干部作风没有转变或转变很少，生产还没有鼓起劲来；有的生产指标订得很高，但缺少具体有力的措施；有的社虽然有了具体措施，但主观力量不够；此外，还有很大一部分社的“三包四到田”“一年早知道”还没贯彻到队，等等。特别是生产措施和主观力量之间的矛盾对目前的生产影响最大。会议特别指出，在解决这个矛盾时，绝不能也不应该单纯依靠增加劳动强度来解决，正相反，在群众热情澎湃的生产高潮中，领导上头脑应该冷静，作风更应踏实，应时刻注意关心群众的生活，注意工作方法，坚决反对任何形式的强迫命令作风，只有这样爱护群众的劳动热情，才能使这种高度的热情坚持下去。
    会议认为，解决问题的关键是解决农业机械和化学肥料问题。因此，进行文化革命和技术革命已成为当前的迫切任务。目前很多地区已经开始的工具改革，就是技术革命的萌芽。截至目前为止，湖北全省已有十八个县实现了运输车子化，这对解决劳动力不足起了重大作用，这种改革必须抓紧继续推广。
    会议指出，农村文化革命和技术革命不仅广大群众要求迫切，而且已经有了可能。完全可以争取早日作到乡乡有中学，社社有小学。地方工业也完全有可能在较短时间内跟上农业大发展的需要。这里的关键问题是必须实现全党全民办工业的方针，充分发挥群众的积极性。会议特别重视天门县小庙乡文化革命和技术革命相结合的经验和天门县新桥乡群众集资办工业的经验。小庙乡把夜校和试验田结合起来，结果，农民学文化和学技术都迅速收到了效果。新桥乡注意对农民进行勤俭持家教育，使户户有存款，最近提出办工业后，这个乡立即就投资二十八万元办化学肥料厂。全县推广这个乡的经验后，很快就集资一千多万元，解决了地方办工业的资金问题。会议认为，现在大办地方工业的条件已经成熟，资金基本没有问题，因此，在这方面必须打破一切保守思想。但是，也应注意技术和设备是否能跟得上，如果不注意这个问题，也会积压资金造成群众不满，挫伤群众办工业的积极性。这就是说，要尽量作到主观要求和客观实际一致。现在应一方面全民动员鼓足干劲，同时也要具体安排，分批分期建设，在建设中由低级到高级，由小到大。只要坚持始终贯彻多、快、好、省这个建设总方针，建设的结果，必然是很快的。为了加强对地方工业的领导，会议要求各级党委要学会右手抓农业、左手抓工业的领导方法，地、县委应派一个书记专管工业。
    根据把生产作为中心这一精神，会议特别注意到整风这个“纲”。目前湖北全省农村整风正在进行。据黄冈专区七千七百二十三个农业社的统计，已经结束整风的有26％。经过整风的地区，工作和生产面貌一新，三类乡、社大大减少甚至绝迹；但是，大部地区整风还是刚开始，一部分还未开始，因此，整风任务还很重，必须结合生产把农村整风进行到底。各地经验证明：大字报在农村整风中，也是一个很好的武器，各地应充分运用。在整风中，应特别注意对落后乡社的改造，要通过整风，改变落后乡、社的面貌，以便使各地区生产大跃进平衡发展。
    同时，会议要求各地首先要打响1958年生产大跃进的第一炮，抓住当前的春耕生产、夏收作物的管理和收获。力争夏收作物丰收。为此，会议决定：各地农业大检查要继续进行，检查重点是春耕生产和夏收作物的管理问题。要进一步解决部分人对增产无信心的保守思想和部分人存在的“差不多”的自满情绪，以保证增产规划的实现。
