Embracing the Present, Downplaying the Past: A Path to Catching Up
Yunnan University History Department Students Chen Lüfan, Zou Qiyu

Which path should the teaching and research of historical science take: detach from revolutionary practice and bury oneself in old books, or closely connect with revolutionary practice and serve the current revolutionary struggle? The answer is very definite: we want the latter. The Party's instructions on this issue are very clear: "Embrace the present, downplay the past, learn while doing."

In the past, our Yunnan University also proposed the direction of "slightly emphasize the past, detail the present," but its implementation was insufficient. Let us cite some facts to discuss. In our history department, in the total of three and a half years of world history teaching time, ancient world history, medieval world history, and modern world history each have four to five hours per week. The period of world contemporary history from 1917 to 1938 also has four hours per week. However, the period of world contemporary history from 1939 to the present only has one semester, and only two short hours per week. As a result, teachers only mention current important issues in a few words or do not mention them at all. For example, the history of Poland and Czechoslovakia since World War II was only covered in a little over an hour, which is probably less detailed than what is written in the World Knowledge Handbook.

Not only that, but what is most perplexing is that we do not teach Soviet history. Is it because it is unimportant and can be omitted? But we know that the victory of the October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history; the establishment and development of the Soviet Union are decisive issues in world contemporary history. Especially today, when "the East wind prevails over the West wind," the history of the leader of socialism—the Soviet Union—should be greatly emphasized. However, why does a history department of a university omit it? Obviously, it is time to eliminate the tendency of "emphasizing the past and devaluing the present"!

Regarding the above issues, some people may raise the reasons of insufficient teaching staff and certain overlaps with other courses. Of course, these facts should also be recognized. But the question is, should we overcome difficulties and strive for progress, or yield to difficulties and stagnate? Is this beneficial to the current revolutionary struggle, or is it detrimental? This is a question that should be considered first.

Obviously, "embracing the present" not only involves spending more time and effort to research and teach modern and contemporary history, and vigorously summarizing the experiences of past revolutionary struggles to serve the current revolutionary struggle, but this is also an extremely important aspect of "embracing the present." To give an example, the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries pointed out: "While opposing dogmatism, the Communist Party believes that, under the current conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-wing opportunism. It is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class, and demands the preservation or restoration of capitalism." Therefore, in researching or teaching the history of the modern and contemporary international workers' movement and communist movement, it is very important to analyze in detail the essence of various revisionist and opportunist schools of thought from Bernstein and Kautsky onwards. Because, doesn't doing so closely integrate the historical struggle of Marxism against revisionism with today's criticism of and struggle against revisionism? Doesn't this fully expose the historical context of revisionism's reactionary capitalist essence?

Naturally, burying oneself in old books is not an entirely undesirable thing. The question is how to "bury." When we deal with ancient people and events, if we can firmly remember that we are studying the past for the sake of the present, then we will not become mired in a large amount of historical data and unable to extricate ourselves.

Recently, the "Yunnan Ethnic Research Center" planning outline formulated by the History Department of Yunnan University determined that while vigorously studying the history of various ethnic groups in Yunnan, it emphasized the study of the Party's ethnic policies in various periods and the issue of the transition of various ethnic groups in Yunnan to socialism. In this way, they have made a great leap forward in the issue of scientific research serving revolutionary practice. Everyone knows that the clearer and more accurate the historical research on the various fraternal ethnic groups in our country, the greater the reference value it will have for the Party's formulation of ethnic policies. Conversely, if we only focus on desperately studying the past of various fraternal ethnic groups, and ignore and know nothing about the current social development status of various fraternal ethnic groups, the Party's ethnic policies, and the current major issues of various fraternal ethnic groups, then this kind of research will not be of much benefit to our revolutionary cause, and we will not be able to truly do a good job in research.

On the other hand, in the research work and teaching work of historical science, in addition to combining history with current major domestic and international issues, we should also vigorously strengthen the research work and teaching work on the latter. For example, today's Middle East is a region where the national independence movement is extremely high, where contradictions between nationalism and imperialism, between imperialism and imperialism, and between socialism and imperialism are intertwined and the struggle is very fierce, and is one of the sources of war-making by imperialism in the world. Faced with this situation, should our historical science workers focus on the history of the Great Arab Empire, the history of the Ottoman Empire, etc. in the future research on the history of the Middle East countries? Or should we focus on studying the struggles of modern Middle Eastern countries? The two should be combined, with the latter as the focus. Wouldn't doing so be more in line with the spirit of "emphasizing the present and downplaying the past"? Wouldn't it be more conducive to our current revolutionary struggle?

In the field of Chinese history, first of all, paying attention to summarizing the basic experiences in our country's revolution and construction is a very important topic. Lenin said: "All nations will inevitably arrive at socialism, this is inevitable, but the way they do it will not be exactly the same. In terms of the form of democracy, in terms of the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, in terms of the speed of socialist transformation in all aspects of social life, each nation will have its own characteristics." The great Chinese Communist Party faithfully follows Lenin's principle, and has made many creative contributions in the socialist revolution and construction, enriching the theoretical arsenal of Marxism-Leninism with extremely great and rich experience. Therefore, expounding and summarizing these contributions is a major task of historical science workers that cannot be delayed. And in this regard, what we have done is extremely unsatisfactory. For example, the People's Republic of China is about to celebrate its ninth anniversary. In the twelve-year plan for philosophy and social sciences in our country, it is stipulated that the history of the People's Republic of China should be written, but how much work have we actually done on this project? Furthermore, how many universities in our country have offered courses on the history of the People's Republic of China? Comparing the actual situation of historical teaching and research work with the leap-forward development of our great motherland is simply too disproportionate!

Of course, it is not easy to achieve the above, and some conditions are not yet so complete. What to do? Is it to wait for the conditions to mature themselves, is it to prepare slowly, or is it to take out revolutionary drive and catch up? Obviously, for the socialist great leap forward, in order to implement the Party's fundamental policy on scientific undertakings—scientific undertakings must serve the great leap forward in production—historical science workers must go all out and resolutely implement the policy of "emphasizing the present and downplaying the past, learning while doing."

    厚今薄古方能迎头赶上
    云南大学历史系学生　陈吕范　邹启宇
    历史科学的教学和研究工作究竟走什么路，是脱离革命实践、埋头于故纸堆中做学问呢？还是密切联系革命实践、服务于当前的革命斗争呢？答案是十分肯定的，我们要的是后者。党对这个问题指示的很清楚，这就是“厚今薄古、边干边学”。
    以前我们云南大学也曾提出过“略古详今”的方向，但贯彻得很不够。且让我们举点事实来谈谈。我们历史系，在总计讲授三年半的世界通史的授课时数上，世界上古史、中古史和近代史每周四至五小时，世界现代史从1917年至1938年这一阶段每周也排了四小时，可是，世界现代史中从1939年到现在的这一阶段，授课时间只有一学期，且每周只有短短的两小时。这样一来，教师在讲授中便对现阶段很多重大问题只有寥寥数语，或者根本不提。例如第二次世界大战以来的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的历史，一共才讲了一个多小时，恐怕还不如世界知识手册上写的详细些。
    不仅如此，最令人不解的是，我们没有讲苏联史。是因为它不重要而可以略去吗？但我们知道，十月社会主义革命的胜利，开辟了人类历史的新纪元；苏联的成立和发展是世界现代史中起决定性作用的问题。尤其是在今天“东风压倒西风”的时候，对于社会主义的头头——苏联的历史，特别应该大讲特讲。然而，一个高等学校的历史系却把它略而不讲，这又是为什么呢？显然，是到清除“厚古薄今”倾向的时候了！
    对于上面这些问题，有人或许要提出师资力量不足以及某些部分与其他课程重复等等原因。当然，这些事实也应该正视。但问题在于，我们究竟是应该克服困难、力争上游呢？还是屈从困难、停滞不前？这样做究竟有利于当前的革命斗争呢？还是不利于当前的革命斗争？这是应当首先考虑的一个问题。
    很明显，“厚今”不仅仅包含着多花时间、多花力量去研究和讲授近代和现代的历史，大力总结过去革命斗争的经验，用来为当前的革命斗争服务，这也是“厚今”的极为重要的内容。举一个例来说。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言指出：“在反对教条主义的同时，共产党认为，在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义。它是资产阶级意识形态的表现，它麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要求保存或者恢复资本主义。”因此，在研究或讲授近代、现代国际工人运动和共产主义运动的历史中，详细分析从伯恩斯坦、考茨基以来的各色各样的修正主义和机会主义流派的本质，是非常重要的。因为，这样做不就把历史上马克思主义对修正主义的斗争与今天对修正主义的批判和斗争密切结合起来了吗？这样不就能把修正主义的资本主义反动本质的来龙去脉全面地揭露出来了吗？
    自然，埋头于故纸堆中，也并不是一件完全要不得的坏事。问题在于怎样个“埋”法。当我们和古人古事打交道的时候，如果能够牢牢记住我们研究过去是为了现在的话，那么，我们就不会沉溺于大量史料之中而不能自拔。
    最近，云南大学历史系制定的“云南民族研究中心”的规划要点，确定在大力研究云南各民族的历史的同时，强调研究党在各个时期的民族政策和云南各民族向社会主义过渡的问题。这样，他们在科学研究服务于革命实践的问题上，就大大跃进了一步。大家知道，对我国各兄弟民族的历史研究得越清楚，越正确，那就会对党制定民族政策有更大的参考价值。相反，如果只顾拼命钻研各兄弟民族的过去，而对各兄弟民族现阶段的社会发展状况，党的民族政策和各兄弟民族当前的重大问题毫不理睬，一无所知，那么，这种研究对我们的革命事业就不会有多少好处，同时也不能真正地搞好研究。
    另一方面，在历史科学的研究工作和教学工作中，除了应当把历史与当前国内外的重大问题结合起来，并且应当大力加强对于后者的研究工作和教学工作。又例如说吧，今天的中近东，是民族独立运动极为高涨的地区，是民族主义与帝国主义之间、帝国主义与帝国主义之间、社会主义与帝国主义之间诸矛盾交错复杂、斗争十分剧烈的地区，是世界上帝国主义制造战争的策源地之一。面对着这种情况，我们历史科学工作者对中近东各国历史的研究，今后应当以大食帝国史、奥斯曼帝国史等为重点呢？还是应当以研究现代中近东国家的斗争为重点呢？应当把两者结合起来，而又以后者为重点。这样做，岂不更符合“厚今薄古”的精神？岂不更有利于我们现在的革命斗争？
    在中国史方面，首先注意总结我国革命和建设中的基本经验，是一个极为重要的课题。列宁说过：“一切民族都将走到社会主义，这是不可避免的，但是走法并不完全一样，在民主的形式方面，在无产阶级专政的形式方面，在社会生活各方面的社会主义改造的速度方面，每个民族都会有自己的特点。”伟大的中国共产党忠实地遵循着列宁的这个原理，在社会主义革命和建设中，作了许多创造性的贡献，以极其伟大而丰富的经验，丰富了马克思列宁主义的理论武库。因此，阐述和总结这些贡献，是历史科学工作者刻不容缓的一项重大的任务。而在这方面，我们所做的是极不能令人满意的。譬如，中华人民共和国成立快九周年了，在我国十二年哲学社会科学规划中规定要写中华人民共和国史，但这个项目，我们究竟已经做了多少工作呢？再说，我们现在倒底有几个高等学校开出了中华人民共和国史的课程呢？拿历史教学、研究工作的实际情况来同我们伟大祖国的飞跃发展相比，简直是太不相称了！
    当然，要做到以上这些，也很不容易，有些条件还不是那么齐备的。怎么办呢？是等待条件自己成熟，是慢条斯理地准备，还是拿出革命干劲，迎头赶上呢？显然，为了社会主义大跃进，为了贯彻党对科学事业的根本方针——科学事业必须为生产大跃进服务，历史科学工作者必须全力以赴，坚决贯彻“厚今薄古，边干边学”这个方针。
