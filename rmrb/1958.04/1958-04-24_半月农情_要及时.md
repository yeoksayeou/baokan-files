    "Half-Month Agricultural Situation" Should Be Timely
      The column "Half-Month Agricultural Situation" is very good, but its shortcoming is untimely reporting. For example, the half-month agricultural situation from Rain Water (February 19th) to the Waking of Insects (March 6th) was not published until March 12th; the half-month agricultural situation from the Waking of Insects (March 6th) to the Spring Equinox (March 21st) was not published until March 28th.
    In addition, there are too many "Corrections." In March alone, corrections appeared on average every three or four days, and some errors were quite serious. I hope the editors will overcome these shortcomings in the Great Leap Forward.

### “半月农情”要及时

专栏：

    “半月农情”要及时
      “半月农情”这一栏很好，但其缺点是报道不及时。如雨水（2月19日）到惊蛰（3月6日）的半月农情拖到3月12日才刊出；惊蛰（3月6日）到春分（3月21日）的半月农情拖到28日才刊出。
    另外，“更正”太多。就3月而言，平均三四天就要出现一次更正，有的错误还是比较严重的。希望编者在跃进中克服这些缺点。
