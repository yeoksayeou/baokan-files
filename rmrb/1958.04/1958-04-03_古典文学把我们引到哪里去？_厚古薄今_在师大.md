At Beijing Normal University, a vigorous "double-anti" movement has unfolded. Judging from the hundreds of thousands of big-character posters exposing problems, the situation of respecting the past and belittling the present, embracing the remnants of the old era, and clinging to the shortcomings of capitalism is very serious.

As the big-character posters reveal, the classical literature teaching in the Chinese Department is filled with a large amount of tedious textual research and meaningless version comparisons. This is not done to provide students with the necessary materials to better understand the historical background of the works and study their ideological and artistic qualities. There are cases like this: A professor assigned a rather heavy task to graduate students, asking them to compare the six novels in "Jingshi Tongyan" with "Jingben Popular Novels" to see what textual differences there were. The graduate students spent several days comparing two of them, "The Jade Guanyin" and "Cui Daizhao's Vengeful Lovers," and found that the biggest difference was that "Tongyan" had an extra sentence: "Who is this man after all? Listen to the next chapter for the answer." As for the other differences, they were even more insignificant. The graduate students consulted the professor to ask what benefits there were in such a comparison, and the professor replied: "A difference of one word is very important. The problem lies there. Don't be afraid of trouble. If you dig into it, there will be benefits." It was also this professor who, when lecturing on "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," did not mention a word about the work's ideology or artistic qualities, but instead talked at length about when Guan Yu was named Marquis, when he was named King, and when he was named Emperor.

In classical literature teaching, there is a bad habit that even when explaining a single word or phrase, one must "invariably mention the three dynasties." A professor lecturing on "Records of the Grand Historian," "Biography of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru," spent a long time on the evolution of the character "Lin," tirelessly telling students: "The original shape of the character 'Lin' was '?', which should be read as 'zhen'. Later, it was written as '?', and only then was it read as lì n, and later it was also written as '閵', also read as lì n. There is a kind of bird called 'Han Lin,' and later there was a kind of grass called 'Lin,' which was formed by adding '艹' to the character '閵', and that is the 'Lin' of Lin Xiangru." It is not known what relationship the character "Lin" has with this story that shaped two patriots and expressed the idea of not dwelling on personal grievances and uniting to resist foreign enemies. Obviously, this kind of tedious textual research is of no significance to literary teaching, and it can only lead students astray. When lecturing on "Records of the Grand Historian," "Basic Annals of the Five Emperors," the same method was used to study "Chi You" for a long time, and the result was that Chi You turned out to be a big bug.

The interest of some professors in tedious textual research and meaningless version comparisons, as a big-character poster said, is "wasting students' youth." In 1954, a criticism of the formalistic and idealistic "Redology" research was launched, but some people insisted on clinging to this set of bourgeois viewpoints and research methods, actually cherishing the past and abandoning the present. Under the influence of this kind of thinking among teachers, many students were wholeheartedly immersed in old paper piles, not concerned about the current literary and ideological struggles, and not reading "People's Literature." They could talk with great relish about the origins of a single word or phrase that had died, but they were ignorant of modern literature and, on the one hand, "disdained it," and also cultivated a bad style of "invariably mentioning the three dynasties" to flaunt their erudition.

Not only that, but respecting the past and belittling the present is also sharply reflected in the attitude towards classical works. The situation of fully affirming and being soft-hearted and soft-handed in criticism, emphasizing art and de-emphasizing ideology, is quite common. Some professors praised Cao Zhi excessively, almost completely affirming him, and even said that Tao Yuanming's "Picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains" had a fighting spirit. And when truly criticizing the class and historical limitations of classical writers, they often used "each has its own merits" to gloss over it.

The reason why teachers do this is that their thoughts and feelings are very compatible with these things. Some openly proposed: "The quality of lyric poetry depends on whether there is 'vacuum emotion'." Starting from bourgeois emotions, they selected a large number of weak and delicate poems, saying that the Song Dynasty poems were "orthodox" and praising Li Qingzhao and Li Shangyin to the heavens, speaking of them vividly and thoroughly, revealing decadent and declining sentimental emotions; while speaking of Xin Qiji and Lu You's poems, there were only dry and bland things like patriotism and optimism.

Due to this kind of subtle influence of thoughts and feelings, many young students are far from struggle. Some are immersed in the "atmosphere" of "the brocade curtain is newly warm, the beast incense is constant, sitting face to face and playing the sheng" or the emotions of "leisurely seeing the southern mountains." Some, influenced by the idea of "drinking to song, how much is life," posted a note on the bedside that said "life in the world, birth and death, death and birth." Some young people, because they have long been influenced by that kind of artistic dream (actually, it is still bourgeois politics first), when right-wing elements used literary forms to write "New Strange Tales of Ancient and Modern Times" and "Strange Vengeance Records," a large number of students in the Chinese Department completely disarmed themselves and greatly praised the "artistic" quality of this vulgar thing, and could not smell the strong anti-Party stench at all. Because of this, a big-character poster correctly asked: "Where does classical literature want to lead us?"

Respecting the past and belittling the present does not start from the proletarian standpoint and viewpoint, but from bourgeois ideology, so distorting works is inevitable.

A teacher lectured on Sholokhov's "Virgin Soil Upturned," saying that Yakov Lukich, a rich peasant counter-revolutionary element who was good at playing two-faced tricks and mixed into the collective farm, had two sides, one of which was loving labor. And when lecturing on Gogol's "Dead Souls," he said that Plyushkin, the representative of serfdom and the typical miser, was a "victim of the serf system," so that students did not hate Plyushkin, but vaguely opposed the serf system! In fact, the serf system and Plyushkin were one. No wonder some students also learned from the teacher and proposed when dealing with rightists: do not hate the rightists, but hate the "social causes" that created the rightists!

In the teaching of Chinese literature, there are many such things!

A certain teacher said: "Dream of the Red Chamber" "mainly writes about the love story of Baoyu and Daiyu," "Baoyu's lifelong ideal is to create free and equal love..." It seems that this is a step forward than the "form is emptiness" theory, but in fact, it is still clinging to that broken stall, inheriting Hu Shi's views and methods, and extracting sinews and skin from this great realistic masterpiece, trying to obliterate its social content. In this gentleman's lecture on "Dream of the Red Chamber," there was not a word or phrase mentioning the work's exposure and criticism of the feudal system. Starting from his above-mentioned basic viewpoint, he selected two chapters, "Hui Zijuan Tests Baoyu with Affectionate Words" and "The Death of Daiyu." And he vulgarly researched the changes in the relationship between Jia Zhen and Qin Keqing in various versions, and whether Shi Xiangyun married Jia Baoyu. People can't help but ask: Where were these gentlemen in 1954? Didn't they gain even a little benefit from that great debate? Another professor revealed the truth of the matter. When he introduced the struggle between Marxism and bourgeois idealism in 1954 to the students, he said: "I read all 300 articles discussing 'Dream of the Red Chamber,' and in a nutshell, what was argued was only a difference of one word, that is, autobiographical or autobiographical. 'Dream of the Red Chamber' is autobiographical, not autobiographical." Some bourgeois intellectuals use an indifferent attitude, or even a resistant emotion of plugging their ears and closing their eyes, to treat the class struggle in the ideological field. In fact, they stubbornly stand on the bourgeois position and cling to the remnants of the old. Some teachers, because their fundamental position has not been transformed, even distort classical works at the expense of propagating their erroneous political views. A lecturer said in the early stage of rectification when lecturing on Sun Wukong's havoc in the Heavenly Palace: "Sun Wukong disliked the small official position of弼马温, which is like the demands of intellectuals," ... "Wukong... also has the bitterness of petty intellectuals who are not appreciated and are subordinate officials, and also has a chivalrous spirit; he has fame... but no position and no power, and is regarded as a dissident, and is unwilling to be restrained. Now many people are making suggestions to the Party, and they also have the feeling of not being appreciated." It was still this lecturer who, when lecturing on "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," greatly rendered "The Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage," emphasizing "respecting the virtuous and cherishing the talented" (another professor also gave full play to "integrity" and "a scholar dies for his confidant" in class), saying something like "The highest ideal of the old Confucian intellectuals in China is to be loyal to the emperor and love the people, and to gain the trust of the emperor in order to implement benevolent governance. This ideal is difficult to achieve. And in the Three Kingdoms, the relationship between Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang, mutual trust, is the most ideal relationship between monarch and minister in Confucianism..." "Confucians want to be officials in order to practice the Dao, but if the ideal is realized, they should retire. Do not want to ask for help from others. 'Those who are successful benefit the world, and those who are poor cultivate themselves alone'." People who have experienced the great storms of last spring can see at a glance that the lecturer is implying something. This had an extremely bad influence at the time.

This is already using the past to satirize the present and chanting the past to imply the present. This attitude also has some degree of repercussions among students. Someone checked and said that after learning classical literature under the guidance of the teacher, he admired the noble aloofness of the ancients and yearned for "a lonely lamp, a cup of strong tea, an ancient book," "to know a confidant, to go through fire and water, without a confidant, to be indifferent and happy." Someone also checked and said that after being criticized by the organization and comrades, he often sought comfort from Li Qingzhao, Zhou Bangyan, and 奥?金, pitying himself and becoming increasingly estranged from the organization and comrades...

The above-mentioned situation, which was fished out of the ocean of big-character posters, is enough to show that the bourgeois ideology cannot serve the socialist economic base at all. At present, quite a few teachers in Beijing Normal University, including quite a few old teachers, have begun to wake up, and many people have made up their minds to strive for both red and expert. However, the struggle between the two roads in teaching and scientific research has not been revealed enough. It is hoped that the distinction between right and wrong can be clarified in the deepening of the movement. (Attached picture)

    古典文学把我们引到哪里去？
    “厚古薄今”在师大
    一群
    北京师范大学展开了气势磅礴的双反运动，从几十万张大字报揭露的问题看，厚古薄今，抱旧时代的残，守资本主义的缺的情况十分严重。
    正如大字报揭露的那样，中文系的古典文学教学充塞了大量的繁琐考证和毫无意义的版本比较，这样作不是为了给学生以必要的材料，借以更好地了解作品的时代背景，研究作品的思想性艺术性。有这样的情况：一位教授给研究生布置了一个分量不轻的作业，叫他们对照“警世通言”中的六篇小说与“京本通俗小说”在文字上有什么不同。研究生们花了几天时间，对出了其中两篇“碾玉观音”与“崔待诏生死冤家”中，最大不同在于“通言”多了一句“这汉子毕竟是何人，且听下回分解”。至于其他的不同更无足轻重了。研究生们去请教教授这样比较有什么好处，答曰：“一字之差很重要，问题就在那里，不要怕麻烦，钻进去了就有好处。”也正是这位教授，自己讲“三国演义”时，对于作品的思想性、艺术性只字未提，却大讲起关羽何时称侯，何时称王，何时称帝。
    在古典文学教学中有一种坏的风气，即使解释一字一词，也“言必称三代”。一位教授讲“史记”“廉颇蔺相如列传”，对“蔺”字的演变就讲了老半天，不厌其烦地告诉学生：“‘蔺’字最初的形状是‘?’，应当读作‘阵’，后来写成‘?’，才读作ㄌㄧ?，后又写作‘閵’，也读作ㄌㄧ?。有一种鸟名叫‘含閵’，后来有一种草叫‘蔺’，那就是在‘閵’，字上加了‘艹’而成为了蔺相如的蔺”。不知道“蔺”字与这个塑造了两个爱国者的故事，表现了不计私怨，团结御侮的思想的作品有什么关系？显然，这种烦琐考证对于文学教学是没有任何意义的，它只能把学生导向歧路。在讲“史记”“五帝本纪”时，也用同样的办法，对“蚩尤”考证了很久，结果考证出蚩尤原来是一条大虫。
    某些教授们对烦琐考证和无意义的版本比较的兴趣，正如一张大字报说的，是“浪费了学生的青春”。1954年对形式主义唯心主义的“红学”研究展开过批判，可是有些人却硬要死抱住这一套资产阶级观点和治学方法，实际上是恋古弃今。在教师们的这种思想影响下，许多学生都一心钻进故纸堆中，不关心当前的文艺思想斗争，不看“人民文学”，对于已经死去了的一字一词的来龙去脉可以谈得津津有味，而对于现代文学，一方面无知，一方面又“不屑齿之”，也养成了一种“言必称三代”，借以眩耀渊博的恶劣作风。
    不仅如此，厚古薄今也尖锐地反映在对待古典作品的态度上，全盘肯定，批判时心软手软、重艺术轻思想性的情况相当普遍，有的教授对曹植倍加赞扬，几乎完全肯定，把陶渊明的“采菊东篱下，悠然见南山”也说成有战斗精神。而真正批判古典作家的阶级和历史局限时，往往又用“各有千秋”一笔带过。
    教师们所以这样，是因为他们的思想感情和这些东西非常合拍，有的公然提出：“抒情诗的好坏，决定于是否有真空感情”。从资产阶级的感情出发，于是就选了大量的柔弱派的词，把北宋的词说成是“正宗”，把李清照、李商隐捧到了天上，讲起来绘声绘形，淋漓尽致，流露出颓废没落的感伤情绪；而讲辛弃疾、陆游的词，则只有干巴巴地几条爱国主义、开朗之类的东西。
    由于这种思想感情的潜移默化，不少青年学生远离斗争，有的成天沉迷于“锦幄初温，兽香不断，相对坐吹笙”的“意境”或“悠然见南山”的情感之中；有的由于受“对酒当歌，人生几何”的思想影响，在床头贴了一张“人生在世，生生死死，死死生生”的字条。有些青年因为长期受那种艺术梦（实际上还是资产阶级的政治第一）的陶冶，当右派分子用文艺的形式写出“新今古奇观”、“奇冤记”时，中文系大批同学完全解除了武装，对这种庸俗东西的“艺术”性大加称赏，根本嗅不出那浓烈的反党臭味来。正因为这样，有一张大字报正确地问道：“古典文学要把我们引到哪里去？”
    厚古薄今，不是从无产阶级的立场观点出发，而是从资产阶级思想出发，于是歪曲作品就是不可避免的了。
    有一位教师讲萧洛霍夫的“被开垦的处女地”，把一个善于耍两面派手法混入集体农庄的富农反革命分子雅可夫·洛济支说成是有两面性，有爱劳动的一面。而讲果戈理的“死魂灵”时，说农奴制的代表者、典型的守财奴泼留希金是“农奴制度的牺牲品”，使学生不知仇恨泼留希金，而空洞地去反对那个农奴制度！实际上农奴制度和泼留希金是一体。难怪有的学生也学着教师的样，在处理右派时提出：不要去恨右派分子，而要去恨那个造成右派分子的“社会原因”！
    在中国文学的教学中，这样的事情可多着呢！
    某教师说：“红楼梦”“主要是写宝玉黛玉恋爱的故事”，“宝玉一生的理想是要创造自由平等的爱情……”。看来这比“色空说”前进了一步，实际上仍然是死守住那个破摊子，因袭胡适的观点方法，对这部伟大的现实主义杰作进行抽筋剥皮，尽力抹杀它的社会内容。在这位先生讲授的“红楼梦”中没有只字片语提到作品对封建制度的暴露和批判。从他以上那个基本观点出发，他选了“慧紫鹃情辞试莽玉”和黛玉之死两回。并且庸俗地考证贾珍和秦可卿的关系在各个版本中的变化，史湘云是否和贾宝玉结婚。人们不禁要问：1954年这些先生们在哪里？难道他们在那场大辩论中没有获得些微教益吗？倒是另一位教授道破了事情的真象，他向学生介绍1954年那场马克思主义与资产阶级唯心主义的斗争时说：“我通读了讨论‘红楼梦’的三百多篇文章，一言以蔽之，所争的只是一字之差，即自传体与自传性。‘红楼梦’是自传性而不是自传体”。有一些资产阶级知识分子就是用漠不关心的态度，甚至用这种塞耳不闻、闭目不见的抵触情绪来对待思想领域里的阶级斗争的。实际上，他们是顽固地站在资产阶级立场抱残守缺。有的教师由于根本立场没有改造，甚至不惜歪曲古典作品，来宣传自己错误的政治观点。有一位讲师在整风初期讲孙悟空大闹天宫，他说：“孙悟空嫌弼马温官小，倒像知识分子的要求”，……“悟空……又有小知识分子怀才不遇、臣属下僚的苦闷，也带有侠义气；他有名……无职更无权，被当作异己分子看，是不甘心受羁糜的，现在许多人向党提意见，也有怀才不遇的心情”。还是这位讲师在讲“三国演义”时，把“三顾茅庐”大加渲染，强调“礼贤下士”（另一位教授也在课堂上大肆发挥过“气节”“士为知己者死”等），说什么“中国儒家旧知识分子最高的理想是忠君爱民，得到皇帝的信任，以行仁政。这理想是很难实现的。而在三国中刘备与诸葛亮的关系，互相信任，是儒家最理想的君臣关系……”“儒家要作官，是为了行道，但理想实现了则应隐退。不想有求于人。‘达者兼善天下，穷者独善其身’。”经历了去年春天大风浪的人，一眼就可以看出讲课人是有所指的。这在当时都起了极其恶劣的影响。
    这已经是以古讽今和诵古寓今了。这种态度在学生中也有着某种程度的反响。有人检查说，在教师指导下学了古典文学，很欣赏古人的清高，向往着“孤灯一盏，酽茶一杯，古书一本”，“得知己，赴汤蹈火，无知己，淡泊寡欢”。也有人检查说，受到组织和同志的批评后，往往向李清照、周邦彦、奥?金那里寻求安慰，自怜自艾，日益和组织、同志疏远……
    就以上这些从大字报海洋中捞出来的一点情况，足以说明资产阶级的意识形态根本不能为社会主义的经济基础服务。目前，北京师大相当多的教师，包括相当数目的老教师，都已开始惊醒起来，不少人已下定决心力争红与专。但是，对于教学与科学研究中两条道路的斗争，却揭露得还很不够，希望在运动深入中能够辨明是非。（附图片）
