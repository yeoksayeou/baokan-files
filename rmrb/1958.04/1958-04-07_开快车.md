    Driving Fast

    With the development of technology, the volume of iron-smelting blast furnaces is also increasing. It is said that the world's largest blast furnace now has a volume of more than 2,000 cubic meters. However, Hebei Province has decided to vigorously promote the "Funing-style" small blast furnace with a volume of only 6.5 cubic meters. Compared with 2,000 cubic meters, 6.5 cubic meters is really a drop in the bucket. Perhaps some people will say that Hebei Province's decision is a step backward!
    In fact, it is not a step backward, but driving fast.
    There is no question that large blast furnaces are more efficient and produce more iron, and are therefore more advanced than small blast furnaces. We also hope to have many, many large blast furnaces. The blast furnaces of Wuhan Iron and Steel and Baotou Steel, which are under construction, have a volume of one thousand several hundred cubic meters. However, there are two sides to everything. Large blast furnaces are efficient and produce more iron, which is their advanced side; but the investment required to build large blast furnaces is also large, and the construction time is also long, which is the side of large blast furnaces that is not easy to popularize. Small blast furnaces are indeed "backward." In the eyes of some people, they may not even be considered blast furnaces at all. I once heard a comrade who had visited Anshan Iron and Steel and then the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant say: "The blast furnace of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant looks like a blast furnace, it is simply a teapot." The "Funing-style" small blast furnace is even smaller than the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, I'm afraid it is "simply an ink bottle." However, the "Funing-style" small blast furnace requires only more than 40,000 yuan in investment, and the construction time is as short as one month, and novices can quickly master the smelting technology, which are its advantages.
    Whether it is better to build large blast furnaces or small blast furnaces is a question that has been debated in the past. I did not inquire about the conclusion. But one thing is certain: without starting from China's specific conditions, a correct answer cannot be found. China's specific conditions are: first, the foundation is weak, and the development of the national economy urgently needs steel; second, the territory is vast, unlike some small countries where building a large steel plant can solve considerable problems, and many steel plants must be built to reasonably supply the needs of various places; third, the country is not yet rich, and its financial, material, and human resources are limited. Under such circumstances, the construction of blast furnaces can only be a combination of large, medium, and small. There are large ones to meet the needs of large industries, and there are medium and small ones to meet the needs of local industries. The "Funing-style" small blast furnace is suitable for the needs of the county. As long as the resources are not a problem, it is not difficult for each county to take more than 40,000 yuan to build a small iron-smelting plant (of course, it is not necessarily limited to 6.5 cubic meters, and it is not impossible to be slightly larger or smaller depending on local conditions). And iron can be produced after one month, which can be said to be a rapid result. If all counties with iron ore resources in the country take action, then we can quickly increase hundreds of thousands or millions of tons of iron-smelting capacity, and more importantly, it can meet the local needs in a timely manner. Isn't this driving fast?
    Obviously, it is driving fast, why do some people feel that it is driving backward? The reason is probably that these people observe things with a metaphysical method. They absolutize everything, good is good to the end, bad is bad to the end; but they do not know that with the changes of time, place, and conditions, many things will transform to their opposite. Modernized large blast furnaces are of course very good, and we will build a certain number of such large blast furnaces in the future, but if all the funds are used to build large blast furnaces, it will cost more money, take a longer time, and cannot meet the needs in a timely manner. The small blast furnace with a volume of 6.5 cubic meters is indeed "backward," but under the specific conditions of our country, it can quickly meet the needs of local economic life, and therefore it is a great good thing. In technological innovation, we must also grasp this dialectic, what to innovate and what to promote, and we cannot only start from the advanced and backward nature of the technology itself, but also consider it in combination with the specific conditions of our country, so as to draw correct conclusions.

    技术愈发展，炼铁高炉的容积也愈大。听说现在世界上最大的高炉，容积已达二千立方公尺以上。然而，河北省却决定大力推广容积只有六点五立方公尺的“抚宁式”小高炉。六点五立方公尺同二千立方公尺相比，真是小巫见大巫，也许有人会说河北省的这项决定是开倒车吧！
    其实，不是开倒车，而是开快车。
    大高炉效率高，出铁多，因而比小高炉先进，这是没有问题的。我们也希望有很多很多的大高炉，正在建设中的武钢和包钢的高炉，容积就有一千几百立方公尺。然而，凡事都有两面。大高炉效率高，出铁多，这是它先进的一面；但建设大高炉需要的投资也多，建设时间也长，这又是大高炉不易普及的一面。小高炉确实“落后”，它在有些人眼中，也许根本算不得是什么高炉。以前曾听见一位先参观了鞍钢，又参观石景山钢铁厂的同志说：“石景山钢铁厂的高炉那像是高炉，简直是把茶壶”。“抚宁式”小高炉又比石景山钢铁厂的小多了，恐怕“简直是个墨水瓶”了。可是，“抚宁式”小高炉的投资少到只需四万多元，建设时间短到只要一个月就行，冶炼技术生手很快就能掌握，却是它的优点。
    是建设大高炉好，还是建设小高炉好，这个问题过去就有过争论。结论如何，我没有打听。但有一条是肯定的：若不从中国具体情况出发，就找不到正确的答案。中国的具体情况一是底子薄，国民经济的发展迫切需要钢铁；二是幅员辽阔，不像有些小国家那样建设一个大钢铁厂就能解决相当问题，而必须建设许多钢铁厂，才能合理地供应各地需要；三是国家还不富裕，财力、物力、人力有限。在这种情况下，高炉的建设只能大、中、小结合。既有大的，来满足大工业的需要，又有中的、小的，来满足地方工业的需要。“抚宁式”的小高炉，适合县的需要。每个县，只要资源没有问题，拿四万多元来建设一个小型炼铁厂，是不难做到的，（当然不一定一律都限于六点五立方公尺，根据当地条件，稍稍大一点，或小一点也未尝不可。）而且一个月以后就能出铁，可谓收效神速。如果全国有铁矿资源的县都行动起来，那么我们很快就能增加几十万、成百万吨的炼铁能力，而更重要的是它能适时满足当地的需要。这不是开快车是什么？
    明明是开快车，为什么有些人觉得是开倒车呢？原因恐怕是这些人用形而上学的方法观察事物。他们把什么事情都绝对化了，好就好到底，坏就坏到底；却不知道随着时间、地点、条件的不同，许多事情都会向自己的对立面转化。近代化的大高炉当然很好，我们今后也还要建设一定数量的这样的大高炉，但如果把全部资金都拿去建设大高炉，花钱既多，时间既长，又不能及时满足需要，六点五立方公尺容积的小高炉，诚然“落后”，但在我国的具体情况下，却能迅速满足地方经济生活的需要，因而是一件大大的好事。在革新技术中，也要掌握这个辩证法，革什么、兴什么，不能光从技术本身的先进和落后出发，还要同我国的具体情况结合起来考虑，才能得出正确的结论。
