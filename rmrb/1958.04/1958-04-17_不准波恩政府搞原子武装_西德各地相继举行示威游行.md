    No Atomic Armament for the Bonn Government
    Demonstrations Held in Various Parts of West Germany
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th - According to the German News Agency, mass movements against Bonn's atomic rearmament policy are continuing throughout West Germany.
    Following the Frankfurt City Council's resolution to hold a referendum on the issue of atomic armament, the Wiesbaden City Council also recently passed a similar resolution, requiring the municipal government to prepare for a referendum. The resolution also stated its refusal to provide land for the construction of rocket bases or the storage of atomic weapons. "Week of Struggle Against Atomic Armament" in Hamburg, West Germany's largest city, already began on the 14th. An appeal signed by Mayor Brauer called on Hamburg citizens to actively participate in mass rallies and demonstrations against atomic armament. The Duisburg "Committee for Struggle Against Atomic Death" announced that this city would hold five rallies protesting atomic armament in the week starting April 15th. Major cities in the Ruhr area are preparing for large-scale anti-atomic armament demonstrations. Workers are preparing to commemorate this year's May Day Labor Day with struggles against atomic death. A conference of trade union representatives in Coburg, representing 14,000 workers, passed a resolution demanding a general strike to prevent West German atomic armament. Police officers participating in trade union organizations in Essen also passed a resolution at a meeting demanding that the central leading bodies of West German trade unions take all possible means of struggle (including strikes) to force the government to rescind its atomic armament decision. Young people are also actively participating in the struggle against atomic armament. Members of the Free German Youth League in West Berlin have been holding a week of struggle since the 11th. They distributed tens of thousands of leaflets to citizens and gathered at major thoroughfares, shouting slogans against equipping the West German army with atomic weapons. Members of the "Hawk Squad," the youth organization of the Social Democratic Party of West Berlin, also held an anti-atomic death demonstration on the evening of the 12th. Some of them lay down on the streetcar tracks to protest. The police brutally dispersed the crowd and arrested eight young people. Young people in other major West German cities are planning to hold grand torchlight processions to protest the government's atomic rearmament policy.

    继法兰克福市议会通过就原子武装问题举行公民投票的决议之后，威斯巴登市议会也在最近通过一项类似决议，要求市政府作好公民投票的准备工作。决议还表示拒绝提供土地建筑火箭基地或储存原子武器。西德最大城市汉堡市“反对原子武装斗争周”已经在14日开始。由市长布劳尔签署的呼吁书中号召汉堡市民踊跃参加反对原子武装的群众大会和示威游行。杜伊斯堡“反对原子死亡斗争委员会”宣布，从4月15日起的一周内，这个城市将举行五次抗议原子武装的大会。鲁尔区各大城市正在筹备反原子武装大示威。工人们准备用反对原子死亡的斗争行动来纪念今年的五一劳动节。科堡市工会代表会议代表一万四千名工人通过决议，要求举行总罢工来阻止西德原子武装。埃森市参加工会组织的警察也在会议上通过决议，要求西德工会中央领导机构采取一切可能的斗争手段（包括罢工），来迫使政府撤消它的原子武装决定。青年们也积极参加了反对原子武装的斗争。西柏林的自由德国青年联盟盟员从11日起举行斗争周。他们向市民散发了好几万份传单，并且在通衢要道集合，高喊口号，反对西德军队配备原子武器。西柏林社会民主党青年组织“鹰团”成员也在12日晚间举行了反对原子死亡示威。他们中间有一部分人卧在电车轨道上表示抗议。警察粗暴地驱散人群，并且逮捕了八名青年。西德其他大城市的青年正在酝酿举行盛大的火炬游行，抗议政府的原子备战政策。
