    The Ten-Year-Old Suona Player
    In the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative of Dihe Village, Yangwei Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, there is a ten-year-old folk musical prodigy named Zhang Nongyan. During the Spring Festival this year, he played several suona tunes at several exchange performances between various townships and cooperatives, all of which were well-received by the audience.

    Zhang Nongyan's father is an expert in Bayin orchestras. Zhang Nongyan always likes to pick up the suona and play it when he comes home from school. After three months of study, he has learned to play twenty tunes such as "Three Main Rules of the Agricultural Cooperative and Eight Points for Attention," "Agricultural Ten-Point Program," "Nailing the Jar," and "Florid Melody," becoming one of the main players in the Bayin orchestra.

    十岁的哨呐手
    山西省平顺县扬威乡底河“五一”农业社，有个十岁的民间少年音乐能手，他叫张弄言。今年春节期间他在各乡社与社的几次交流演出会上，吹奏了几支唢呐曲牌，都博得听众的欢喜。
    张弄言的父亲，是搞八音会的行家。张弄言每逢放学回家，总喜欢拿起唢呐来吹弄，经过三个月的钻研，已经学会了吹“农业社三大纪律八项注意”、“农业十大纲要”、“钉缸”、“花腔”等二十支曲牌，成为八音会的主要吹奏家之一。
