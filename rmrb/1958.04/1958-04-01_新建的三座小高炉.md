Newly Built Three Small Blast Furnaces

    The first small blast furnace in Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province, with an annual output of 40,000 tons of pig iron, produced its first molten iron at 10:55 AM on February 25, thirty-five days ahead of schedule. The second small blast furnace is expected to produce iron in May ahead of schedule.

    The first small blast furnace of the Baotou Municipal State-Owned Iron and Steel Plant began construction on the 28th.
    This small blast furnace will produce about 30,000 tons of iron annually after completion. Iron production is expected to begin in August of this year. It will use ore from the Baotou Iron and Steel Mining Mountain, without the need for additional mining and ore dressing equipment. The furnace body is a waste furnace transported from Xuanhua. All equipment is simple and crude, saving more than 100,000 yuan in investment. The entire plant investment can be recovered in four years.

    新建的三座小高炉
    安徽省马鞍山市新建的第一座年产四万吨生铁的小高炉，已经提前三十五天在2月25日上午十点五十五分流出第一炉铁水。第二座小高炉又可以提前在5月份出铁。
    上图是第一号高炉。张振国（安徽日报社稿）
    包头市地方国营炼铁厂的第一座小高炉，28日动工兴建。
    这座小高炉建成后每年可产铁三万吨左右。今年8月就可出铁。它将使用包钢铁矿山的矿石，不用另搞采矿、选矿设备，炉体是从宣化运来的废炉，一切设备因陋就简，因而省下了十多万元投资。四年就可收回全部建厂投资。　（据新华社讯）（附图片）
