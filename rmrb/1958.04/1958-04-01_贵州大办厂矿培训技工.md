Guizhou Vigorously Runs Factories and Mines to Train Technicians

This dispatch from our newspaper in Guiyang on March 31st: After the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed in February a plan to increase the province's local industrial output value sevenfold in five years and catch up with the agricultural output value, a wave of enthusiasm for running industries has been set off throughout the province. Many regions are planning, preparing, constructing, and producing simultaneously. In January and February alone, 406 factories and mines run by cities, special districts, and counties have already been put into production. On average, seven factories and mines are put into production every day.

A series of problems in the development of local industries are being solved by taking leap-forward measures. When there is a shortage of technical personnel, people are sent out to study and visit, old factories train personnel for new factories, technical personnel are mobilized to return to their posts, local technicians are fully utilized, and short-term training classes and part-time industrial technical schools are opened. The Zunyi Prefectural Committee also adopted the method of concentrating efforts to first develop one pilot project, and then carry out large-scale training after successful trials.

    贵州大办厂矿培训技工
    本报贵阳31日电　中共贵州省委在2月提出地方工业产值五年增长七倍、赶上农业产值的规划以后，全省掀起了办工业的热潮。许多地区边规划，边筹备，边兴建，边生产。1、2月份，只是市、专区、县办的厂矿，已投入生产的就有四百零六个。平均每天有七个厂矿投入生产。
    发展地方工业中的一系列问题，都在采取跃进的办法解决。技术力量不足，就派人出去学习参观，由老厂给新厂训练人马，动员技术人材归队，充分利用土技师，开办短期训练班和半工半读的工业技术学校。遵义地委还采取了集中力量先搞一个点的办法，试办成功以后再来大量训练。
