    Frequent Sandstorms in North China in Spring
    Wang Hong
    In our country, the winter is controlled by the high pressure formed by the cold air mass entrenched in Siberia. From October of the previous year to March of the current year, it is the season when the winter monsoon prevails – characterized by strong winds, cold and dryness, with the wind direction mainly from the northwest. The summer, however, is controlled by the high pressure formed by the cold air mass entrenched in the Pacific Ocean. From May to August of the current year, it is the season when the summer monsoon prevails, with weaker winds, warm and humid conditions, and the wind direction mostly from the southeast. The months of April and September are the seasons of transition between the winter and summer monsoons, both with transitional characteristics. The wind force, direction, and the degree of dryness and humidity are not fixed.
    The six months of winter monsoon and the four months of summer monsoon are not balanced. Their pattern is a process of weakening, strengthening, and then weakening again.
    In spring, theoretically, it is the process of the summer monsoon weakening to strengthening, but due to the strength of the winter monsoon, the southerly air currents are often blocked south of the Yangtze River basin, and North China is still occupied by the winter monsoon. Therefore, while the Jiangnan region is already in a season of "gentle breezes and warm sunshine, with light rain urging the flowers to bloom," North China is experiencing days of "bitter spring cold, with dry winds splitting rocks."
  In autumn, theoretically, it is the period when the summer monsoon gradually retreats from its strong position, but due to the strong winter monsoon, it quickly occupies the Yellow River basin, forming the rainy season. Therefore, while Jiangnan is experiencing "October spring, with high skies and crisp air," North China is experiencing "torrential rain, with the golden wind sending cold."
    Because of this, the spring and autumn seasons in North China are particularly short.
    In summer and autumn, North China has more rainfall, and vegetation grows luxuriantly on the ground. Even with wind, dust and sand cannot be stirred up. In winter, the ground freezes, and although the wind is strong, there is little dust and sand. Only in spring, when the ground thaws, plants have not yet grown, and it is dry with little rain, a large amount of water is lost from the soil, forming particles of dust and sand. Therefore, with the onset of strong winds, sand and stones fly. This not only destroys the beautiful scenery of spring, but also causes great damage to the wear and tear of machinery and the loss of soil fertility.
    The only fundamental way to eliminate dust and sand and change the climate is "greening." After trees form forests, they can reduce wind force, increase rainfall, prevent sandstorms, and retain soil moisture, and the dry and windy conditions of spring will disappear.

    华北春季多风沙
    王虹
    我国，冬季受西伯利亚盘据的冷空气所形成的高气压控制，从头年10月到来年3月，都是冬季风盛行的季节——风力强，寒冷干燥，风向以西北风为主；夏季却由盘据在太平洋的冷空气所形成的高气压控制，从当年5月到当年8月，都是夏季风盛行的季节，风力较小，温暖潮湿，风向多东南风。4月和9月这两个月，是冬夏季风转换的季节，都带有过渡的特点，风力、风向和干冷、温湿都不能固定。
    六个月的冬季风和四个月的夏季风，也不是平衡如一的，它们的规律都是由弱转强再转弱的过程。
    春季，按理是夏季风由弱转强的过程，但是，由于冬季风的强盛，南来的气流常常被阻在长江流域以南，华北仍为冬季风所占领。因此，江南已是“风和日暖，小雨催花”的季节，华北却是“料峭春寒，燥风裂石”的日子。
  秋季，按理是夏季风由强转弱逐渐退让的日子，但由于冬季风强盛，很快就占领了黄河流域，形成了雨季。因此，江南是“十月阳春，秋高气爽”的季节，华北却是“大雨滂沱，金风送冷”的日子了。
    就因为这样，华北的春秋二季就显得特别短暂。
    夏秋二季，华北地区的雨水较多，地面上植物生长茂盛，就是有风也起不了尘沙；冬季地面冻结，虽然风大，尘沙却少；只有春天，地面冻解，植物尚未生长起来，干燥少雨，土壤中水分大量失散，形成粒粒尘沙。因之大风一起，飞沙走石。这不但杀尽了春天好风光，而且对机器的磨损和土壤肥力的散失都有很大危害。
    消灭尘沙，改变气候，唯一而根本的办法，就是“绿化”。树木成林之后，就能减低风力，增加雨量，阻止流沙，保持土壤水分，而春季干旱的大风也就随之销声敛迹。
