    "Malan Flower" in the Soviet Union
    The Moscow Central Children's Theater recently staged the Chinese fairy tale "Malan Flower." In order to help their Soviet colleagues perform this play well, the Beijing Children's Theater and the Shanghai Children's Theater sent them many Chinese folk art albums, "Malan Flower" stills, and other related materials. Chinese students studying at the Soviet Drama Institute also participated in the preparation of the performance.
    The performance at the Moscow Central Children's Theater was a great success. The top picture shows Chinese and Soviet children watching the play together, moved by the plot; the bottom picture is a scene from the stage.

    “马兰花”在苏联
    莫斯科中央儿童剧院最近上演了中国童话剧“马兰花”。为了帮助苏联同业演好这出戏，北京儿童剧院和上海儿童剧院曾寄给他们很多中国民间艺术画册、“马兰花”剧照和其他一些有关的材料。在苏联戏剧研究院学习的中国留学生也参加了演出的准备工作。
    莫斯科中央儿童剧院的演出获得了很大的成功。上图是中苏儿童一同观剧，他们一齐为剧中的情节感动了；下图是舞台上的一个镜头。
