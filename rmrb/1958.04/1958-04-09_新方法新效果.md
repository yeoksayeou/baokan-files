    New Methods, New Results
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Ruogang
    On April 2nd, Zhang Hongshu, the director of Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory, as usual, went to the foundry workshop as an apprentice. During his labor, he encountered this problem: The iron molds urgently needed by the foundry workshop were always not completed on time by the tool workshop, which made the foundry workers very anxious. The parts cast from iron molds are smooth and flat, and do not require machining, which plays a significant role in saving steel and processing time. However, why hasn't such a measure with significant savings value been smoothly implemented?
    In the past, the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory held several workshops director meetings every week to study and solve problems that occurred in production. When solving problems such as mutual cooperation in production, everyone often emphasized their own difficulties, and sometimes even quarreled. In the end, the factory director made some criticisms and instructions. However, this method of solving problems could not completely solve some problems. The situation of the Great Leap Forward forced the leadership to take new methods to solve problems.
    After encountering the problem that iron molds could not be supplied, Director Zhang Hongshu thought: The reason why the workers and cadres in the foundry workshop urgently need iron molds is because they have seen the benefits of iron molds. If the workers and cadres in the tool workshop also had the same desire for iron molds as the foundry workers, then the problem would be solved. Therefore, he gave the foundry workshop an idea, asking them to display two kinds of parts with different qualities cast from iron molds and sand molds for comparison, and invite the leaders and workers from the tool workshop to visit in their spare time, so that they could personally feel the great significance of their labor achievements. The comparison of these two parts showed that the parts cast from iron molds were light and smooth and could be used without machining; if the parts cast from sand molds were changed to iron molds, the molten iron used for one part could be used to cast three parts.
    This method of using vivid facts to educate and solve the problem of mutual cooperation between workshops has played a significant role. The director of the tool workshop immediately proposed a guarantee that the production tasks of iron molds would be completed on time in the future. The workers also expressed that they would improve their operation methods and increase the production efficiency of iron molds. That night, the efficiency of Wang Fengcai and Wang Donglai, two night shift workers, in making iron molds doubled.

    新方法新效果
    新华社记者　孙若刚
    4月2日，哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂厂长张鸿树，照例来到翻砂车间作徒工。他在劳动中遇到这样一个问题：翻砂车间急需的铁模，工具车间总是不能按时完成，这使翻砂工人很着急。用铁模铸成的部件，光滑平整，不需要进行机械加工，对节省钢铁和加工时间作用很大。可是，为什么这样一件有重大节约价值的措施，却没有得到顺利贯彻呢？
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂过去每周都召开好几次车间主任碰头会，研究解决生产中发生的问题。在解决生产中相互协作等问题时，常常各自强调困难，有时甚至争吵起来。最后，厂长作些批评和指示。但是，这种解决问题的方法对有些问题并不能作到彻底解决。大跃进的形势逼迫领导必须采取新的方法解决问题。
    张鸿树厂长在遇到铁模供不上的问题后，他就想：翻砂车间的工人、干部所以迫切需要铁模，就是因为他们看到了铁模的好处。假如工具车间的工人、干部也有翻砂工人那样需要铁模的心情，那末问题就解决了。因此，他给翻砂车间出了个主意，让他们把用铁模和用砂模铸成的两种质量不同的部件摆出来作对比，邀请工具车间的领导和工人在业余时间来参观，让他们亲身感受到自己劳动成果的重大意义。这两种部件的对比表明：用铁模铸成的部件轻巧光滑，不用进行机械加工就可以使用；把砂模铸成的部件改用铁模铸，一个部件所用的铁水就可以铸成三个部件。
    这种用活生生的事实教育来解决各车间的相互协作问题，起了很大作用。工具车间主任立即提出保证，今后一定按时完成铁模生产任务。工人们也都表示要改进操作方法提高铁模生产效率。当晚，夜班工人王风财、王东来两人做铁模的效率就提高了一倍。
