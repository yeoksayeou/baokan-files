Reported by Yunnan Daily: Opposing "Knowledge is Private, Individual Work, Technical Conservatism, Unwilling to Open Up"; Advocating "Knowledge is Public, Collective Cooperation, Revolutionary Technology, Complete Openness"; This was recently proposed by scientist Qu Zhongxiang at a forum of scientists in Kunming. Participants in the forum included Zhu Liangfu, Du Fen, Qu Zhongxiang, Lan Hu, Zhu Yancheng, Wang Huaiqing, Zhang Tianfang, Li Xiji, Chen Bangben, Cao Chengyi, Sun Jianyi, Sun Naizhong and 25 others.

The scientists believe that the main reason why scientific work is far behind the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production is that the view that scientific work must serve production and start from the 600 million people is not clear, and thinking cannot keep up with the development of the situation. Du Fen said that his plan to study schistosomiasis would take at least a year to grasp the egg-laying period of Oncomelania hupensis, but many places have proposed to eliminate schistosomiasis within a year. If he continues to conduct research according to the original plan, there will be no research objects. Fang Yong sharply pointed out the phenomenon of scientific research work being divorced from reality. For example, in highway design, in the past, foreign experience was often copied, and not enough consideration was given to designing according to the characteristics of the mountainous areas of Yunnan. Especially at present, when various places have proposed to eliminate human carrying and implement mechanized earthwork in transportation, how can scientific research work in highway engineering meet this need? This issue has been considered even less. Zhang Tianfang and Sun Jianyi further criticized the bourgeois individualism trend in scientific research work. They pointed out that even today when private ownership has been changed, many scientific workers still have "Knowledge is Private, Individual Work" in their minds, like to formulate unrealistic grand plans, regardless of the needs of national construction, and study strange diseases and strange events, blindly pursuing so-called international standards. Therefore, the scientists believe that they should actively respond to the initiative of the seventeen scientists in Shanghai to become both red and expert, and even redder and more expert, within five years, and learn from the determination of Shanghai scientists to strengthen their ideological transformation. Zhu Liangfu said: "Of course, business must also make a leap forward. But in formulating plans, we should first grasp the ideological leap forward, and only with a leap forward in thinking can we have a leap forward in planning."

Reported by Yunnan Daily: Going to production, supporting the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, and solving the problem of redness and expertise of intellectuals has become a trend among senior intellectuals in major universities and colleges in Kunming. At present, many senior intellectuals have established contacts with agricultural cooperatives and factories to help solve scientific and technical problems. Li Liangsi, a lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at Kunming Normal College, personally went to the Xiaojie Township farmers in Guandu District, Kunming, at the request of the farmers, brought various fertilizers back to the school for chemical analysis, and handed the results to the farmers in writing. He also brought back several rose plants from the township to cultivate and observe, to help farmers solve technical difficulties. Kunming Institute of Technology sent eighteen lecturers and teaching assistants to Chuxiong, Honghe and Yuxi to survey mineral deposits. This year, the school has undertaken the tasks of investigation and research, surveying and design, and supplying some mechanical equipment for eleven small and medium-sized non-ferrous metal metallurgical mines entrusted by the Industrial Department. Hu Yiren, a lecturer in the Department of Agronomy at Yunnan University, held a bacterial fertilizer training class in Yuxi; Associate Professor Luo Guangxing is also conducting high-yield experiments at the Jinxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, and is preparing to open a short-term training class, while summarizing the experience of local experienced farmers as teaching materials. The teachers of the Chinese Department of Yunda, who are often regarded as studying the ancients, are also formulating plans to prepare for researching and sorting out some of the legends of the working people in history as popular reading materials.

    反对“知识私有，个人单干，技术保守，不肯交心”  提倡“知识公开，集体合作，革新技术，彻底交心”
    昆明科学家决心自我革命
    各大专学校高级知识分子支援生产成风气
    本报讯　据云南日报报道：反对“知识私有，个人单干，技术保守，不肯交心”，提倡“知识公开，集体合作，革新技术，彻底交心”；这是科学家曲仲湘最近在昆明的一次科学家座谈会上所提出的。参加这次座谈会的有竺良甫、杜棻、曲仲湘、蓝瑚、朱彦承、王槐清、张天放、李希迹、陈邦本、曹诚一、孙建毅、孙乃忠等二十五人。
    科学家们认为：当前科学工作远远落后于工农业生产大跃进的主要原因，在于科学工作必须为生产服务、从六亿人口出发的观点不明确，思想跟不上形势的发展。杜棻说，他所制订的研究血吸虫的规划，至少要一年才能掌握钉螺的产卵期，而许多地方已提出了一年内消灭血吸虫，如果再按原订计划进行研究，连研究对象也没有了。方墉尖锐指出了科学研究工作脱离实际的现象，如在公路设计方面，过去硬搬外地经验多，根据云南山区的特点来进行设计不够，特别在当前各地提出消灭人背人挑、在运输方面实行土机械化的时候，公路工程方面的科学研究工作如何满足这方面的需要呢？对这个问题就考虑得更少了。张天放、孙建毅进一步批判了科学研究工作中的资产阶级个人主义倾向，他们指出：即使在私有制已经改变了的今天，不少科学工作者的头脑中仍然存在“知识私有，个人单干”，喜欢制订不切合实际的大计划，不顾祖国建设需要，研究奇病、奇事，一味追求所谓国际水平。因此，科学家们认为，应当积极响应上海十七位科学家提出的在五年内做到又红又专、更红更专的倡议，学习上海科学家加强自我思想改造的决心。竺良甫说：“当然，业务也要跃进。但是在制订规划时，应首先抓住思想跃进，有跃进的思想才能有跃进的规划”。
    本报讯　据云南日报报道：到生产中去，支援工农业大跃进，解决知识分子红与专的问题，在昆明各大专学校的高级知识分子中已形成风气。目前已有很多高级知识分子和农业社、工厂建立联系，帮助解决科学技术问题。昆明师范学院的化学系讲师李良驷，曾应昆明官渡区小街乡农民的要求，亲自去将各种肥料带回学校化验分析，并把结果写成书面文字交给农民。他还从这个乡带回几株玫瑰花来培植观察，帮助农民解决技术上的困难。昆明工学院派了十八名讲师和助教，分赴楚雄、红河和玉溪等地去勘测矿藏。这个学校今年应工业厅的委托，已承担了十一个中小型有色金属冶金矿的调查研究、勘测设计和供应部分机械设备的任务。云南大学农学系胡以仁讲师在玉溪举办细菌肥料训练班；副教授罗光星也正在金星农业生产合作社作丰产试验，并准备开办一个短期训练班，同时总结当地老农的经验作为教材。常被看作是研究古人的云大中文系的教师们也正在制订规划，准备研究整理出一部分历史上劳动人民的传说作通俗读物。
