    Recently released "Special Issue on Anti-Waste," "Special Issue on Patriotic Health Campaign," "The Great Leap Forward in Rural Areas" (First Collection), and "Moving Mountains and Creating Seas for the Spring Festival" are several better news documentaries. The success of these films lies in the fact that the creative staff has indeed grasped the pulse of the times, followed the traces of social progress, and boldly and creatively gathered information and compiled it into special issues or special features, enabling the films to reflect the trends of several national and nationwide great movements under the same theme. The scope of reflection is broadened, the content is enriched, and the persuasiveness is strengthened. For example, "Special Issue on Anti-Waste" uses several subtitles to organically link together the anti-waste situations of several representative units in the industrial, cultural and artistic, and commercial sectors under the film's overall title, "The Flame of Anti-Waste." From this, people can see the general scale of the anti-waste movement and the universality and seriousness of the waste phenomenon, which is not only diverse but also unified and complete. It is worth mentioning in passing the use of a technical shot: allowing the subtitles of each subtitle to appear on the burning flame, which not only fits the theme but also has a sense of strengthening the integrity of the whole film. This is a relatively appropriate use of technical shots in news films. "Special Issue on Patriotic Health Campaign" also uses several subtitles to focus on reflecting the various aspects of the patriotic health campaign. If "Special Issue on Anti-Waste" is a concentrated criticism, then "Special Issue on Patriotic Health Campaign" is a concentrated praise. "The Great Leap Forward in Rural Areas" (First Collection) also uses several subtitles to reflect the Great Leap Forward situation in various rural areas, focusing on demonstrating the wisdom of the masses.
    These films also have their own characteristics. "Special Issue on Anti-Waste" is lively and smooth, with a humorous and satirical tone, and is a short film in the style of criticism. "Special Issue on Patriotic Health Campaign," however, is characterized by detailed descriptions. For example, in the section on Aunt Peng's enthusiasm for checking hygiene, the photographer successfully introduced Peng Da Niang, an activist on the street. Her words, smiles, and actions are all kind and respectable. Here, the author successfully used simultaneous recording. Aunt Peng completely used her own vocabulary (the vocabulary of the masses) to explain the benefits of the hygiene movement to the masses, which is vivid and natural, making the characters more real and moving. The section on the collective effort to catch mice first shows people the activities of the mice and the grain accumulated in the large rat holes, and then introduces the various methods of catching mice created by the masses one by one, which strengthens the film's appeal and arouses great interest among the audience. "The Great Leap Forward in Rural Areas" (First Collection), this magazine film has its own unique features in considering the harmonious unity of subtitles and content. For example, "Determination Brings in the Zhanghe River Water," "Liang Huanmu Has Many Clever Plans," "Pulley Flies and Picks Thousands of Square Meters of Earth," "Channel is Carved on Thousand-Li Cliffs," and "Spurring the Horse to Harness the Barren Mountains" and other words and phrases are rich in strong national characteristics and are also very harmonious and unified with the content to be expressed, making the film's style complete and prominent.
    "Moving Mountains and Creating Seas for the Spring Festival" is characterized by its enthusiastic mood, joyful atmosphere, and compact content. The film successfully blends the joyful atmosphere of people celebrating traditional festivals with their heroic and selfless labor enthusiasm, which is full of emotion and power. The transitions between shots are very good, such as the villagers organizing a comfort team to visit the construction site to greet the New Year and then transitioning to the bustling construction site scene, and the old lady cooking dumplings for the festival and then transitioning to the commando team's earth-digging competition on the construction site, all of which have achieved very good results. The film's shooting of labor scenes is also relatively successful. For example, the shots of soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army creating conveyor belts and new-style bulldozers (people sitting on plows, pulling with people and pedaling the soil with their feet) are very full of emotion. Also, the scene of people working all night on New Year's Eve and organizing an earth-carrying competition as a gift for the Spring Festival shows a continuous stream of people running back and forth in the dark carrying earth, and people working shirtless in the freezing cold of minus ten degrees Celsius, which fully reflects the heroic spirit of people "making the high mountains bow their heads and letting the rivers make way." It makes people truly feel that under the leadership of the Party, the people have infinite wisdom and power in building their own country and creating their own happiness.
    These films are very short, but they have a strong appeal, which deserves attention.

    谈几部新闻纪录短片
    丁峤
    最近上映的“反浪费专号”、“爱国卫生运动专号”、“农村大跃进”（第一辑）”和“移山造海过春节”是几部较好的新闻纪录片。它们成功的地方，就是创作人员确实握住了时代的脉息，跟着社会前进的迹印，大胆而富有创造性地把情况汇集起来，编成专号或特辑，使影片得以在同一的主题下，把目前几个全国性、全民性的伟大运动的动向反映出来。反映的面广了，内容丰富了，说服力也就加强了。例如“反浪费专号”便是用几个小标题，把工业、文化艺术和商业部门的几个有代表性的单位的反浪费的情况，在影片的总标题“反浪费的火焰”下有机地联结起来的。从中使人看到反浪费运动的大略规模，看到浪费现象的普遍和严重，不但丰富多样，而且完整统一。值得顺便提到的是一个技巧镜头的运用：让每个小标题的字幕，在熊熊的火焰上显现，不仅切合主题思想并有加强全片完整性的感觉。在新闻片运用技巧镜头方面，这是用得比较恰到好处的。“爱国卫生运动专号”同样用几个小标题集中反映了爱国卫生运动的各个方面的情况。如果说“反浪费专号”是集中的批评，那末“爱国卫生运动专号”就是集中的表扬。“农村大跃进”（第一辑）同样用几个小标题反映了各地农村大跃进的情况，集中表现了群众的智慧。
    这些影片也各有自己的特色。“反浪费专号”的活泼流畅，具有幽默、讽刺的情趣，是批评样式的短片。“爱国卫生运动专号”却以细致的描写见长，如彭大娘热心查卫生一节，摄影师成功地介绍了街道积极分子彭大娘，她的一言一笑，一举一动都令人感到亲切可敬。这里作者成功地运用了同时录音，彭大娘完全用自己的语汇（群众的语汇）向群众讲解卫生运动的好处，生动自然，使得人物更为真实感人。群策群力捉老鼠一节，先让人看到老鼠的活动，大鼠洞中堆积的粮食，然后逐一介绍群众创造的种种捕鼠方法，都加强了影片的感染力，引起观众莫大的兴趣。“农村大跃进”（第一辑）这一本杂志片在斟酌小标题与内容的和谐统一方面，有独到之处。如“决心引来漳河水”、“梁焕木巧计多谋”、“滑车飞挑千方土”、“千里峭壁凿渠道”、“快马加鞭治荒山”等措词用字富有浓厚的民族色彩，与所要表现的内容，也十分谐和、统一，使影片的风格显得完整和突出。
    “移山造海过春节”则以情绪热烈、气氛欢乐、内容紧凑见长。影片成功地把人们过传统节日的欢乐气氛和人们毫迈忘我的劳动热情揉合在一起，富有感情和力量。镜头衔接得很好，如老乡们组织慰问队到工地拜年接热火朝天的工地场景，老大娘煮饺子过节接工地上突击队挖土竞赛等都收到很好的效果。影片对劳动场景的拍摄也比较成功，如解放军某部战士们创造运输带和新式推土机（人坐在耙犁上一边用人拉一边自己双脚蹬土）的几个镜头，情绪非常饱满，又如表现年三十晚上人们通夜劳动，并组织了挑土竞赛，作为对春节的献礼时，画面上出现川流不息的在黑夜里挑土飞奔的人流，以及人们在零下十度的严寒中赤膊劳动等，也充分反映了人们“让高山低头，叫河水让路”的英雄气概，使人真正感觉到在党的领导下，人民群众在建设自己国家和缔造自己幸福的时候，有着无穷的智慧和力量。
    这几部影片篇幅很短，但是却有很强的感染力，这是值得重视的。
