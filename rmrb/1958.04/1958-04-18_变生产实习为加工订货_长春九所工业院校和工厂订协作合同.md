Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Transforming Production Internships into Processing Orders

Changchun, April 17 – The Changchun Automobile and Tractor Institute, Changchun Automobile Manufacturing School, and seven other institutions of higher and secondary professional education, which possess a considerable amount of machinery and technical personnel, have recently signed production cooperation contracts with sixteen factories in Changchun, closely integrating the implementation of the work-study program with the development of local industry.

This approach offers numerous benefits to both factories and schools. Factories can address a significant portion of their difficulties related to insufficient technical expertise and production equipment. For example, the jointly owned Kui Lijin Water Pump Factory needs to manufacture over 4,000 water pumps for the state this year and complete 1,200 units before the spring plowing season. However, the factory lacks sufficient equipment and technical personnel, and it can only produce 1,500 units annually. Now that this factory has signed cooperation agreements with three schools, including Changchun Workers' Technical School and Changchun Automobile Manufacturing School, the state no longer needs to invest in this factory, and the factory does not need to increase equipment or buildings to complete the state-mandated tasks on time. At the same time, the equipment of these three schools was previously only used for student internships, and the products produced during the internships were treated as waste. Now that they have accepted processing orders from many factories outside the schools, students' internships will result in finished products, which will not only utilize the equipment capacity but also improve the quality of teaching.

Many factories, when arranging production cooperation, have taken into account the schools’ teaching needs based on contractual requirements, first assigning students to make simple, scattered products, and then gradually assigning them to make precise, complex, and complete sets of products. Currently, many factories have initially proposed 188 processing tasks to various schools.

The Changchun Municipal Bureau of Industry recently introduced the products of its affiliated enterprises to the schools, and the schools also introduced their production potential to each other, sharing information in order to effectively implement cooperation contracts and support each other. The Changchun Municipal Bureau of Industry has also established a specialized organization to manage this type of cooperative production and organize various professional collaborations.

    变生产实习为加工订货
    长春九所工业院校和工厂订协作合同
    据新华社讯　拥有相当多机器设备和技术人员的长春汽车拖拉机学院、长春汽车制造学校等九所高等学校和中等专业学校，最近同长春市十六个工厂签订了生产协作合同，把贯彻勤工俭学方针和发展地方工业紧密地结合起来。
    这样做法对工厂和学校都有很多好处。工厂可以解决很大一部分技术力量和生产设备不足的困难。例如公私合营奎利金制泵厂今年要给国家制造四千多台抽水机，并要在春耕以前完成一千二百台，但是这个厂设备和技术力量不足，全年只能生产一千五百台。现在这个工厂同长春工人技术学校、长春汽车制造学校等三所学校订立协作合同以后，国家不必再向这个工厂投资，工厂也不必增加设备和厂房，便可以按时完成国家规定的任务。同时，这三所学校的设备过去只供学生实习用，实习时的产品是当废品来处理的，现在它们接受校外许多工厂加工订货以后，学生实习就要出成品，既发挥了设备能力，也提高了教学质量。
    许多工厂在安排生产协作时，都根据合同要求，照顾了学校教学，先分配给学生作简单、零星的产品，逐步分配给他们作精密复杂、全套的产品。目前已有许多工厂向各学校初步提出一百八十八项加工任务。
    长春市工业局最近向各学校介绍了所属企业的产品，各学校也向对方介绍了本校的生产潜力，互相交底，以便很好地实现协作合同，互相支援。长春市工业局还成立了一个专门管这种协作生产的机构，组织各种专业协作。
