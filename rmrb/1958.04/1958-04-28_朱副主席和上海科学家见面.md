Vice Chairman Zhu Meets with Shanghai Scientists
By our reporter, Yang Ying

April 16th was during the late spring season in the Jiangnan region. On this day, the weather in Shanghai was particularly warm. At 10:45 AM, Vice Chairman Zhu De, accompanied by Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, arrived at a quiet courtyard on Yueyang Road, the location of several research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai.

Vice Chairman Zhu was wearing a semi-new navy blue serge Zhongshan suit, looking radiant and full of energy. No one would believe he was over seventy years old.

In the conference room on the second floor of the building, the scientists excitedly reported on their work to Vice Chairman Zhu. Vice Chairman Zhu listened carefully, with a smile on his face, and occasionally asked them questions.

Vice Chairman Zhu had already become interested in castor silkworms while in Beijing. The castor silkworm is a new type of silkworm introduced from India. It grows very quickly, being able to spin silk and make cocoons in fifteen or sixteen days, and can be raised continuously for five or six generations a year, possessing great economic value. However, the castor silkworm cannot hibernate on its own, making it impossible to propagate in China. Zhu Xi, Deputy Director of the Institute of Experimental Biology, and others, based on Michurin's principle of distant hybridization, crossed a wild silkworm from China with the castor silkworm, and after five years of continuous research, succeeded in enabling the castor silkworm to grow and reproduce in China.

As soon as Vice Chairman Zhu saw Zhu Xi, he asked about the castor silkworm.

Zhu Xi said, "After the castor silkworm research was successful, the biggest problem now is promotion. We hope that the agricultural, industrial, and foreign trade departments will pay attention to this matter."

Vice Chairman Zhu said, "To promote it, you can run some training classes, or you can compile books, written in a popular and easy-to-understand style."

Zhu Xi told Vice Chairman Zhu, "Two training classes have already been held, training 120 people, who have been assigned to various provinces, but the number of people is still too small." Vice Chairman Zhu said, "This work has a lot of potential."

After Wang Yu, Deputy Director of the Institute of Organic Chemistry, reported on his work, Vice Chairman Zhu asked with concern, "How well do you combine theory with practice?"

Wang Yu replied apologetically, "In the past, our research came from practice, but later there was a tendency to deviate from practice and delve into theory. Now we must return to practice. The scientists in the institute are all considering the issue of connecting with practice."

Vice Chairman Zhu agreed with his opinion, nodding and saying, "National industrialization requires chemistry to be very important. We must greatly develop chemistry in the second five-year plan, and in the future, we must catch up with international standards. Do you have the confidence?" Wang Yu replied loudly, "We will definitely strive to achieve it."

Not only natural scientists but also social scientists participated in the symposium.

When the historian Zhou Yutong was introduced, Vice Chairman Zhu asked:
"Do you have any contact with the Museum of Literature and History?"

Zhou Yutong said, "The old gentlemen in the Museum of Literature and History are living people and living events. We invite them to write things."

Vice Chairman Zhu said, "They have rich experience, and if they change their viewpoints, they can write things."

Luo Zongluo, Director of the Institute of Plant Physiology, reported on his work. Vice Chairman Zhu asked him, "Do you study forest plants?"

"In 1952, in cooperation with Jiangsu Province, we planted shelterbelts on saline-alkali land along the coast of northern Jiangsu. We measured the salt tolerance of trees," Luo Zongluo replied.

Vice Chairman Zhu said happily, "This is very important. Our country has a lot of saline-alkali land."

Zhao Chengzhen, Director of the Institute of Materia Medica, told Vice Chairman Zhu that he had developed a simple method for extracting the cardiac stimulant digitalis, which had been adopted by the Zhejiang Pharmaceutical Factory. The quality of the digitalis extracted had reached the level of that in Britain.

Vice Chairman Zhu talked with Zhao Chengzhen about the issue of traditional Chinese medicine. Vice Chairman Zhu said, "In the past, it was wrong to exclude traditional Chinese medicine. Now we are cooperating, but there are still problems. We Chinese people have survived for thousands of years relying on traditional Chinese medicine, which shows that traditional Chinese medicine is useful. We must study it carefully, and it may make new contributions to the world."

Zhao Chengzhen said, "Our country has a large output of ephedrine, which can be sold abroad."

"That's very good, ephedrine can serve the people of the world." Vice Chairman Zhu's words made everyone laugh.

Feng Depi, Wang Yinglai, Directors of the Institutes of Physiology and Biochemistry, and Academician Zhang Xiangtong also reported on their work to Vice Chairman Zhu.

Vice Chairman Zhu encouraged everyone to be both red and expert. He said, "All aspects are undergoing a great leap forward, and science must also undergo a great leap forward. Now workers are knocking on your doors, and farmers are knocking on your doors, all asking you for things. You must work hard!"

The cordial discussion came to an end here.

At the end of the meeting, Vice Chairman Zhu said, "Thank you all, I have learned from you today." His spirit of humility moved the scientists to the point where they didn't know what to say.

At this time, the office had already closed for the day, but people had not gone to lunch. The building inside and out was crowded with people, all waiting to see Vice Chairman Zhu. When Vice Chairman Zhu came out of the conference room, dozens of hands stretched out to him.

Vice Chairman Zhu walked across the lawn and personally went to the silkworm room to see the castor silkworms. Zhu Xi presented Vice Chairman Zhu with specimens of castor silkworm eggs, pupae, cocoons, and moths. Vice Chairman Zhu also carefully observed the spotted castor silkworms eating castor leaves, as well as samples of spun silk and woolen fabrics made from a blend of castor silkworm silk, domestic silkworm silk, and wool. Vice Chairman Zhu stroked the silk and asked with concern, "Is there any problem with dyeing?" When people told him that it could be dyed into various colors, a satisfied smile appeared on Vice Chairman Zhu's face.

It was almost half-past twelve when Vice Chairman Zhu left the Academy of Sciences. The bustling Academy of Sciences building could not calm down for a long time. People were all considering one question: how concerned Vice Chairman Zhu is about science, and how should we leap forward by leaps and bounds!

    朱副主席和上海科学家见面
    本报记者　杨瑛
    4月16日，正是江南的暮春时节，这一天，上海的天气特别温暖。上午十点三刻，朱德副主席由中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显陪同，来到了岳阳路上一座幽静的大院落里，这里是中国科学院上海地区几个研究单位的所在地。
    朱副主席穿着一身半新的藏青哔叽中山装，容光焕发，精神矍铄，谁也不会相信他已是七十开外的人。
    在大厦二楼的会议室，科学家们兴奋地向朱副主席报告自己的工作。朱副主席仔细地倾听着，脸上露出微笑，不时向他们提出一些问题。
    朱副主席在北京的时候，早已对蓖麻蚕发生了兴趣。蓖麻蚕是一种从印度引进来的新蚕，它长得很快，十五、六天便能吐丝结茧，一年能连续养五、六代，有很大的经济价值。但是蓖麻蚕自己不能冬眠，无法在中国传种接代。实验生物研究所副所长朱洗等根据米丘林远缘杂交的原理，用我国一种野蚕和蓖麻蚕交配，经过五年来不断研究才使蓖麻蚕能在中国生长和繁殖。
    朱副主席一见朱洗，便问起蓖麻蚕的事。
    朱洗说：“蓖麻蚕研究成功之后，现在最大的问题是要推广，希望农业、工业和对外贸易部门重视这件事。”
    朱副主席说：“要推广，可以办些训练班，也可以编书，要写得通俗，容易看懂的。”
    朱洗告诉朱副主席：“训练班已办过两期，训练了一百二十人，分到各省，人数还是太少。”朱副主席说：“这件工作是很有前途的。”
    有机化学研究所副所长汪猷报告工作以后，朱副主席关切地问：“你们理论和实际联系得怎么样？”
    汪猷歉意地回答：“过去我们的研究是从实际中来，以后有脱离实际的倾向，钻到理论中去了，现在还要回到实际中去。所里的科学家都在考虑联系实际的问题。”
    朱副主席赞同他的意见，点点头说：“国家要工业化，化学很重要，第二个五年计划要大大地搞化学，今后还要赶上国际水平，你们有没有把握？”汪猷响亮地回答：“我们一定努力争取。”
    参加座谈会的不仅有自然科学家，还有社会科学家们。
    介绍到历史学家周予同的时候，朱副主席问：
  “你们和文史馆有没有联系？”
    周予同说：“文史馆的老先生是活人活事，我们请他们写东西。”
    朱副主席说：“他们经历很丰富，改变了观点，可以写出东西来的。”
    植物生理研究所所长罗宗洛报告了他的工作，朱副主席问他：“森林植物你们研究不研究。”
      “1952年，配合江苏省在苏北沿海一带盐碱地上种植防护林，我们对树木的耐盐力进行过测定”，罗宗洛回答说。
    朱副主席高兴地说：“这很重要，我国盐碱地很多。”
    药物研究所所长赵承嘏告诉朱副主席，他曾经研究出一种简便的提炼强心剂毛地黄的方法，已被浙江制药厂采用，提炼出来的毛地黄，质量已赶上英国。
    朱副主席和赵承嘏谈到中医的问题，朱副主席说：“过去对中医排挤是不对的，现在合作了，但是也不是没有问题了。我们中国人几千年来，靠中医中药活下来了，这便说明中医中药是有用的。要好好研究它，可能对世界有新的贡献。”
    赵承嘏说：“我国麻黄素的产量大，可以推销到国外去。”
      “这很好，麻黄素可以为世界人民服务了。”朱副主席的话，引得大家都笑了。
    生理、生化研究所的所长冯德培、王应睐，学部委员张香桐等也都向朱副主席报告了他们的工作。
    朱副主席勉励大家要又红又专。他说：“各方面都在大跃进，科学也要大跃进。现在工人来敲你们的门，农民来敲你们的门，都来向你们要东西，你们要努力啊！”
    亲切的座谈到这里结束了。
    散会的时候，朱副主席说：“谢谢大家，今天向各位领教了。”他的谦逊精神，使科学家们感动得不知道说什么是好。
    这时候，机关里已经下班了，但是人们并没有去吃中饭，大厦内外，挤满了人群，大家都等待着要见见朱副主席。朱副主席从会议室出来，顿时几十双手都伸向朱副主席。
    朱副主席穿过草地，亲自到蚕室去看蓖麻蚕。朱洗把蓖麻蚕的卵、蛹、茧、蛾的标本送给朱副主席看，朱副主席还仔细观察了正在吃蓖麻叶的身上带着斑点的蓖麻蚕，用蓖麻蚕丝和家蚕丝、羊毛等混纺成的绢纺和毛织物的样品。朱副主席抚摸着绢绸，关心地问：“染色有没有问题？”当人们告诉他可以染成各种颜色时，朱副主席脸上露出了满意的微笑。
    快到十二点半了，朱副主席才离开科学院。沸腾的科学院大厦，久久不能平静下来，人们都在考虑一个问题：朱副主席是多么关心科学，我们该怎样大踏步跃进呢！
