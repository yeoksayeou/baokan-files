    Insufficient power machinery and water lifting tools are the main difficulties in developing farmland irrigation. Many areas are looking for ways to overcome this difficulty. The measures proposed at the recent Jiangsu Provincial Representative Meeting of Advanced Producers in Mechanical and Electrical Irrigation and Drainage provide a correct path to overcome this difficulty. Based on the exchange of advanced experiences and vigorous exploration of the potential of existing equipment, the meeting has decided to more than double the effectiveness of existing irrigation projects, with mechanical and electrical irrigation expanding from the original more than 7 million mu to more than 18 million mu. This is a great leap forward in mechanical and electrical irrigation, which is of great significance for consolidating the achievements of water conservancy construction and striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.
    The working class across the country has undertaken the glorious task of supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production. This year, many factories will produce 2.05 million horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery for farmers. This number is more than three times the total amount of irrigation and drainage machinery originally in China's rural areas. By the end of March, 160,000 horsepower of machinery had been delivered, and the remaining machinery will also be delivered successively. However, due to the unprecedented development of water conservancy construction, this 100,000 to 200,000 horsepower of machinery is clearly not enough to meet the needs of the large increase, which is still growing rapidly. Many places have put forward requests to increase the supply of machinery. Faced with this contradiction, what should we do? The correct attitude should be to find ways in many aspects and make the greatest efforts to effectively use all water conservancy projects.
    What is the most effective way at present? According to practical experience, mobilizing the masses to improve existing irrigation and drainage equipment and giving full play to the potential of existing equipment is one of the most economical and effective ways.
    Jiangsu's experience proves that the potential of existing mechanical equipment is still very large. Hengshe Pumping Station in Wuxi County used the dragon bone carts widely used by the masses and successfully tested using a 25-horsepower pump to tow eight wooden carts, averaging 127 mu of irrigated land per horsepower, exceeding the Jiangsu Province's average of 50 mu per horsepower last year by more than double. Xin Du Pumping Station in Wuxi enabled a 25-horsepower power machine to tow three water pumps, and the irrigated area also increased by more than double. The Changshu County Irrigation Management Office used the original axial flow pumps to be converted into wooden pipe axial flow pumps, which not only reduced the cost and saved steel, but also increased the water output by twice as much as a pump of the same horsepower. Jianyang Irrigation Station in Jianhu County improved its technology, increasing the irrigated area per horsepower of the pump by more than 20%. The "battery-free starting method" manufactured by workers at the Liyang County Irrigation Station can effectively prevent the pump from stopping due to battery damage. There are many similar creations. A total of sixteen creations and improvements in this regard were exhibited at the Jiangsu Provincial Representative Meeting of Advanced Producers in Mechanical and Electrical Irrigation and Drainage. It is precisely because of the discovery and summarization of these many valuable creations that Jiangsu Province was able to decide to increase the average irrigated area per horsepower from 50 mu last year to 120 mu, and strive to reach 150 mu. The Wuxi City Suburban Irrigation Company has even proposed using 30 pumps to undertake the irrigation tasks of the original 100 pumps.
    Jiangsu Province has such huge potential in mechanical and electrical irrigation and drainage, why can't other regions have it? The problem lies in whether to rely on the masses, look downwards, explore and encourage the creative wisdom of the masses, and conscientiously summarize and promote the creations and experiences among the masses. If all regions can tap the potential of existing mechanical equipment by relying on the masses like Jiangsu Province, and maximize the efficiency of mechanical irrigation and drainage, it will be equivalent to increasing more irrigation and drainage machinery this year. This will not only greatly alleviate the contradiction that power machinery and water lifting tools cannot keep up with irrigation needs, but also greatly reduce the cost of farmland irrigation, thereby bringing more benefits to farmers.
    In order to give full play to the potential of irrigation equipment, it is also necessary to strengthen technical training and improve management systems so that the original and newly added large amount of power machinery and equipment can be managed more rationally and scientifically. In particular, the newly developed mechanical irrigation areas need to rely on the help of old irrigation areas to train a large number of mechanics and management cadres with preliminary technical capabilities and who are basically competent. With such technical strength, the machinery can be quickly installed when it goes to the countryside, and the season can be seized to put it into irrigation and drainage work in a timely manner.
    To meet the needs of the great development of irrigation, it is far from enough to rely solely on the machinery supplied by the original national industrial departments, no matter how much. Therefore, while vigorously tapping the potential of mechanical equipment, it is also necessary to mobilize the vast number of farmers and handicraft workers to actively manufacture water lifting tools and simple and inexpensive water drawing machinery that meet local needs, in accordance with the principle of using local materials. Farmers and handicraft cooperative members in many areas of Henan and Hebei provinces have made many important creations in water lifting tools. Many of these tools and simple machines are not only low in cost, but also more efficient than the old water lifting tools. Mass creation and promotion of such water lifting tools and simple machines is the most reliable and main way to expand the irrigated area in the current situation where power machinery is still very scarce.
    In order to widely develop water conservancy and irrigation, another good way is to develop gravity irrigation. All places with conditions should make overall plans according to natural conditions, guide the situation, and try to change water lifting irrigation into gravity irrigation. In order to develop gravity irrigation, it is sometimes necessary to break the boundaries of cooperatives and the boundaries of administrative divisions, and establish an irrigation network of mutual exchange and mutual assistance within a wider scope. We believe that as long as we strengthen collectivist education among the masses and vigorously advocate cooperation and mutual assistance, the farmers in our country who have already broken away from the shackles of private land ownership will definitely be able to realize such an irrigation network. Jia County in Henan Province has already done this, and other regions can certainly do it as well.

### 尽量发掘现有灌溉设备的潜力

    尽量发掘现有灌溉设备的潜力
    动力机械和提水工具不足，是当前发展农田灌溉事业中的主要困难。许多地区正在寻找克服这个困难的办法。最近闭幕的江苏省机电灌排先进生产者代表会议提出的措施，为克服这个困难提供了正确的途径。这次会议在交流先进经验、大力挖掘现有设备潜力的基础上，已经决定把现有灌溉工程的效能提高一倍以上，其中机械和电力灌溉从原有的七百多万亩扩大到一千八百万亩以上。这是机电灌溉事业上的一个大跃进，它对于巩固水利建设成果和争取今年农业大丰收，都有巨大的意义。
    全国工人阶级承担了支援农业生产大跃进的光荣任务。今年有许多工厂将为农民生产出二百零五万马力的灌溉排水机械。这个数字比我国农村原有的全部灌溉排水机械多两倍还多。到3月底，已有十六万马力的机械交货，其余的机械也将陆续交货。虽然，由于水利建设的空前发展，这一、二十万马力的机械，显然还不能满足大量增长了而且仍在迅速增长着的需要。不少地方都提出了增加机械供应的要求。面对着这个矛盾，我们应该怎么办呢？正确的态度，应该是多方面想办法，尽最大努力把全部水利工程都有效地使用起来。
    目前最有效的办法是什么呢？根据实际的经验，发动群众改进现有的灌溉排水设备，充分发挥现有设备的潜力，就是最经济、最有效的办法之一。
    江苏的经验证明，现有机械设备的潜力还很大。无锡县横?抽水机站利用群众普遍使用的龙骨车，试验成功了用一部二十五马力抽水机拖八部木车，平均每马力灌田一百二十七亩，超过去年江苏省平均每马力灌溉数量五十亩的一倍以上。无锡新渎抽水机站使一部二十五马力的动力机拖三部水泵，灌溉面积也增加一倍以上。常熟县灌溉管理所利用原有的轴流式水泵改制成木管轴流式水泵，不但降低了造价，节约了钢材，而且出水量较同样马力的抽水机提高一倍。建湖县建阳灌溉站改进技术，使抽水机每马力灌溉面积提高了20％以上。溧阳县灌溉站工人制造的“无电瓶开车法”，可以有效地防止抽水机因电瓶破坏而发生停车事故。类似的创造还有不少。在江苏省机电灌排先进生产者代表会议上展出的有关这方面的创造和改进共有十六项。正是因为发现了和总结了这许多宝贵的创造，江苏省才能决定把每马力的平均灌溉面积由去年的五十亩增加到一百二十亩，争取达到一百五十亩。无锡市郊区灌溉公司更提出以三十部抽水机担负原有一百个抽水机的灌溉任务。
    江苏省在机电灌排方面拥有这么巨大的潜力，其他地区为什么不能有呢？问题在于是否依靠群众，眼睛向下，发掘和鼓励群众的创造智慧，认真总结和推广群众中的创造和经验。如果各地都能像江苏省那样依靠群众挖掘现有机械设备的潜力，尽量提高机械灌溉和排水的效能，那就等于今年增加了更多的灌排机械。这不但会大大缓和目前动力机械和提水工具赶不上灌溉需要的矛盾，而且将大大降低农田灌溉的成本，从而带给农民更多的利益。
    为了发挥灌溉设备的潜力，还必须加强技术训练，健全管理制度，这样才能把原有的和新增加的大量动力机械设备管理得更合理、更科学。特别是新发展的机械灌溉区，更需要依靠老灌区的帮助，大批训练具有初步技术能力、基本上能够胜任的机械手和管理干部。有了这样的技术力量，就可以在机械下乡的时候，很快地把机械安置起来，抓紧季节，及时地投入灌溉和排水工作。
    要满足灌溉事业大发展的需要，光靠原有的国家工业部门供应的机械，无论怎样也是很不够的。所以在大力挖掘机械设备潜力的同时，还必须发动广大农民和手工业工人，按照就地取材的原则，积极制造适合当地需要的提水工具和简易廉价的汲水机械。河南、河北两省许多地区的农民和手工业社社员，在提水工具方面已有很多重要的创造。其中许多工具和简易机械不但成本低廉，而且效率比旧有的提水工具还高。大量创制和推广这样的提水工具和简易机械，是在目前动力机械还很缺乏的情况下扩大灌溉面积的最可靠的最主要的办法。
    为了广泛地发展水利灌溉，另一个好办法就是发展自流灌溉。一切有条件的地方，都应该根据自然条件，全面规划，因势利导，尽量把提水灌溉变为自流灌溉。为了发展自流灌溉，有时需要打破合作社的界限和行政区划的界限，在更广大的范围内建立起一个互通有无、互济互助的灌溉网。我们相信，只要对群众加强集体主义教育，大力倡导协作互助，已经摆脱了土地私有制束缚的我国农民是一定能够实现这样的灌溉网的，河南省郏县已经作到了这一点，其他地区当然也可能做到。
