Xinhua News Agency, Da Qaidan, 22nd – Spring has arrived in the Qaidam Basin, and mass sports activities here are flourishing. Workers in Da Qaidan, Mangai, Golmud and other places are actively preparing for ball games, track and field events, and shooting competitions to be held on International Labor Day on May 1st.

The members of the field geological teams and the light drilling teams always carry a single-legged basket with a wooden pole and a basketball hoop, or a basketball hoop with a wooden board, when they go to work in the field. Whether in the high mountains or on the Gobi Desert, as long as the pole is erected, they can play basketball "games." The members of the 502nd Light Drilling Team of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau also use gasoline drums and thin steel plates to build table tennis tables in the field for practice. Along the Cha (Ka) Mang (Ai) Highway, many road maintenance workers can be seen playing ball games on the basketball and volleyball courts they have built themselves.

In the past year or so, there have been thirty-seven basketball and volleyball teams in Qaidam, including six women's basketball teams, as well as table tennis, track and field, and shooting teams, with a total of 500 athletes. Last year, the Qaidam team also participated in the provincial sports meet held in Qinghai Province. This year, seven sports associations will be established in Da Qaidan, Mangai, Tanggula Mountain and other regions.

    柴达木盆地的体育活动
    新华社大柴旦22日电　春天来到了柴达木盆地，这里的群众性体育活动已经蓬勃地开展起来。大柴旦、茫崖、格尔木等地职工正积极准备在“五一”国际劳动节举行球赛、径赛和射击比赛活动。
    野外地质队、轻便钻井队的队员们，在到野外工作时总是带着一根木杆一个篮圈的独脚篮，或者一块木板一个篮圈的篮球架，不拘在高山或在戈壁滩上，只要把杆子一竖，他们就可以进行篮球“比赛”。青海石油勘探局轻便钻井五百零二队的队员们还利用汽油桶和薄钢板在野外搭起乒乓台进行练习。在茶（卡）茫（崖）公路沿线，可以见到许多养路工人在自己修起的篮球、排球场上进行球赛。
    一年多来，柴达木已有三十七个篮球、排球队，其中有六个女子篮球队，还有乒乓、田径、射击等队，共有运动员五百人。去年柴达木代表队还参加了青海省举办的省级运动会。今年大柴旦、茫崖、唐古拉山等地区将建立七个体育协会组织。
