Cooperative Collaboration, Joint Leap Forward
	Shouyang County Agricultural Cooperatives Overcome Difficulties Through Mutual Assistance
	Jiaocheng County's Cooperative Movement Advances Production and Construction in Tandem
	(Our Report) The seventy-three agricultural cooperatives in Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, are carrying out large-scale socialist cooperation between cooperatives, exchanging resources, coordinating, and supporting each other, to promote a great leap forward in agricultural production.
	When these seventy-three agricultural cooperatives were implementing this year's leap forward plan, they encountered serious difficulties due to the lack of certain materials and technologies. For example, some agricultural cooperatives planned to expand the planting area of ​​tuber crops, but their seed reserves were insufficient. Members of the Dongguang Agricultural Cooperative created a method of well-digging using waterwheels to draw water and buckets to dig mud, but they couldn't promote it because they didn't have enough bricks and stones. The Xiazhou Agricultural Cooperative dug a well, but the wellbore collapsed halfway due to a lack of technical knowledge. The Defeng Agricultural Cooperative was preparing to change the course of the river, but couldn't start construction because of interspersed land belonging to other cooperatives. However, in reality, it wasn't that every cooperative lacked everything, but rather that each cooperative had surpluses and shortages. For example, some agricultural cooperatives didn't have enough quality seeds for planting, while others had surpluses in stock. Some cooperatives urgently needed materials that they couldn't buy anywhere, while other cooperatives had them stockpiled in warehouses because they were unsuitable for use or not needed temporarily. Originally, some adjacent agricultural cooperatives could have solved problems by adjusting resources with each other, but due to a lack of organized coordination, they didn't know what each other had, which prevented the problems from being solved.
	After analyzing this situation, the Shouyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first selected several agricultural cooperatives to conduct a thorough investigation and implement small-scale cooperation. The Shouyang County Committee convened a cooperation meeting attended by the directors of thirteen agricultural cooperatives. At the meeting, cooperative cadres "displayed their assets, calculated surpluses, and raised needs," adopting the approach of helping each other to solve problems, which enabled many agricultural cooperatives to overcome difficulties that they couldn't overcome on their own.
	The Shouyang County Committee further summarized and affirmed the benefits of this approach. But it was found that the scope of cooperation was too small, and the content of cooperation was limited, so some problems could not be completely solved. Therefore, six adjacent townships were selected to expand the cooperation of thirteen agricultural cooperatives into a large cooperation of seventy-three agricultural cooperatives. This larger-scale cooperation enabled the agricultural cooperatives to completely solve problems in five areas: seeds, fertilizer, technology, interspersed land, and labor. The seventy-three agricultural cooperatives mutually supported and supplemented each other with more than 120,000 jin of various seeds and more than 600,000 saplings. With the seed problem solved, it was possible to ensure that 9,000 mu of crops were planted on time. At the same time, the greening movement immediately entered a high tide. The interspersed lands between the seventy-three agricultural cooperatives were far from the cooperatives in the past, so cultivation was extensive, yields were low, and mis-planting and mis-harvesting often occurred, which affected land capital construction and the construction of water conservancy projects. After consultation, the seventy-three agricultural cooperatives exchanged 1,734 mu of interspersed land, turning distant land into nearby land. According to preliminary calculations, this alone can save more than 5,000 workdays per year, and after changing the extensive cultivation of these lands, it can also increase grain production by more than 80,000 jin. The agricultural cooperatives of Gucheng and Jianshan villages sent five water conservancy technicians to provide special technical guidance, so that some wells that were damaged and projects that were suspended due to lack of technical knowledge began to be rebuilt and resumed. The Yeguling and Guoyi agricultural cooperatives jointly established a blacksmith's furnace, which not only made it more convenient for the two cooperatives to repair and manufacture agricultural tools than in the past, but also made use of many idle and broken tools, achieving both labor and money savings. In the process of cooperation, the experience of Xin Sheng and other agricultural cooperatives in rationally organizing and arranging labor and changing human carrying to cart pulling was also exchanged and promoted, enabling each agricultural cooperative to generally find ways to solve the labor problem. Everyone praised this large-scale socialist cooperation, saying that: everyone's dead treasure becomes a living treasure, and joint leap forward is guaranteed.
	(Our Report) Reporter Deng Zichang reports: In order to adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production, Jiaocheng County, Hebei Province, widely launched a socialist great cooperation (ie, great mutual assistance) movement between townships, cooperatives, and teams, resulting in new phenomena such as advanced areas leading backward areas, accelerating the progress of sowing, and continuing to set off a water conservancy upsurge, and further improved the ideological awareness of the peasant masses.
	All agricultural cooperatives in this county are village cooperatives with insufficient strength. After starting to sow spring wheat, water conservancy construction was almost completely stopped. The agricultural cooperatives in Waliwang Township were the first to try large-scale cooperation. They concentrated 600 laborers and worked hard for four days and nights to dig 150 "mutual assistance wells" in 1,500 mu of land without water conservancy facilities, basically realizing water conservancy. The Jiaocheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this new initiative and immediately conducted investigations and studies, believing that this was the correct way to achieve common progress by helping the backward with the advanced and to ensure that all production work leap forward in tandem, and promptly summarized and promoted it. Since the end of March, this movement has gradually formed throughout the county.
	There are four forms of large-scale cooperation in Jiaocheng County: first, the cooperation of several townships to jointly tackle a large-scale project, which is still a minority; second, the joint assistance of all agricultural cooperatives in the township, which has now been adopted by more than 70% of the townships; third, the cooperation between several agricultural cooperatives; fourth, the cooperation between production teams within agricultural cooperatives. The labor remuneration of members participating in large-scale cooperation generally takes the following methods: small-scale labor exchange and mutual assistance; large-scale labor is done as voluntary labor by the agricultural cooperative, and members record work points in their own cooperatives; work points are recorded for members, calculated according to the general cooperative's work value, and the agricultural cooperative benefiting from the project provides remuneration. The scope of large-scale cooperation was initially only in manpower, but now includes materials and financial resources; the initial cooperation was limited to water conservancy projects, but gradually developed to sowing and watering, as well as running joint agricultural tool processing plants, etc.
	The main advantage of this large-scale cooperation is that it can concentrate enough strength to complete an urgent task that a township, cooperative, or team cannot complete alone. For example, eight agricultural cooperatives in Dongxindian Township were unable to transform and utilize the accumulated water in twelve large pits and solve the problem of watering due to their weak strength. Other agricultural cooperatives in the township displayed the spirit of mutual assistance and jointly sent more than 2,400 male and female laborers, bringing their own tools and grain, and worked hard for two days and nights to make 80% of the eight cooperatives' cultivated land have water conservancy conditions. At the same time, all agricultural cooperatives in the county also established eighteen joint agricultural tool processing plants based on townships, investing 423 members with iron and woodworking skills, investing more than 28,000 yuan, investing more than 100,000 jin of iron and 154 cubic meters of wood. Up to now, these processing plants have produced 23 types of simple water-lifting tools with more than 1,300 sets, 6 types of new-style seeding machines with more than 3,800 units, and more than 3,200 waterwheel parts for agricultural cooperatives.
	At present, the large-scale cooperation movement in Jiaocheng County is booming and is increasingly showing its great role. In terms of water conservancy construction, the labor force invested has reached more than 70,000 people, and the newly built projects can expand the irrigated area by more than 180,000 mu. In terms of spring plowing production, the daily progress of drought-resistant and rush-planting field crops has also increased from more than 11,000 mu to more than 19,000 mu. At the same time, the socialist ideological awareness of the peasant masses has also been further improved. In Ziyingzi Township, twenty-one individual peasant households in ten villages personally experienced the benefits of large-scale mutual assistance and actively applied to join the agricultural cooperatives.

    社社协作　共同跃进
    寿阳县农业社互通有无困难迎刃而解
    交河县协作成运动生产建设齐头并进
    本报讯　山西省寿阳县的七十三个农业社开展社和社之间的社会主义大协作，互通有无、相互配合和支援，促进农业生产大跃进。
    这七十三个农业社在执行今年跃进计划的时候，由于各农业社缺乏部分物资和技术，分别遇到了严重的困难。例如有些农业社计划扩大薯类作物种植面积，但薯种储备不足；东光农业社社员创造了水车掏水、吊桶挖泥的打井法，因为砖石不够用不能推广；下州农业社打了一眼井，因为不懂技术，井筒坍坏半途而废；德丰农业社准备要改变河道，因为有外社的插花地不能动工。但是实际上，各项物资和技术并不是社社缺、样样缺，而是各社互有余缺。如有的农业社优良种籽不够播种使用，另外却有些农业社库存有余；有些社急用物资到处买不到，而在其他社里却因为不适合用和暂时不需要积压在仓库里。本来有些毗连的农业社只要相互调剂就可以互相解决问题，但是由于缺乏组织串连工作，互相不摸底，使问题得不到解决。
    中共寿阳县委分析了这种情况以后，首先选择了几个农业社进行摸底，并实行小范围的协作。寿阳县委召开了十三个农业社社主任参加的协作会。会上，社干部们“摆家底、算长余、提需要”，采取了一家有困难大家帮助解决的办法，使好些农业社本身不能克服的困难都迎刃而解。
    寿阳县委会进一步总结和肯定了这种作法的好处。但发现协作面过小，协作内容受到限制，有些问题还不能彻底解决。于是选择了六个毗邻乡把十三个农业社的协作扩大成七十三个农业社的大协作。这次规模较大的协作使各农业社种籽、肥料、技术、插花地以及劳动力等五个方面的问题都得到完满的解决。七十三个农业社互相支援、互相补充了各样种籽十二万多斤、树苗六十多万株。由于种子问题得到解决，可以保证九千亩作物按时下种。同时绿化运动马上进入了高潮。七十三个农业社互相之间的插花地，过去由于离社远，耕作粗放，产量很低，还常常发生错种误收现象和影响土地基本建设和水利工程的兴建。七十三个农业社经过协商调换了一千七百三十四亩插花地，使远地都变成了近地。据初步计算，仅此一项每年就能节约五千多个工，改变这些地耕作粗放的现象后，还可增产八万多斤粮食。古城、尖山两村的农业社派出了五个水利技术员，专门作技术巡回指导，使一些农业社因不懂技术打坏的井和停工的工程开始得到改建和复工。野孤岭和郭义两个农业社联合举办了一座铁匠炉，不仅两个社修打农具比过去方便了，许多置闲既坏工具也都被利用起来，作到了的省工又省钱。在协作过程中，新生等农业社合理组织和安排劳动力、变人担为车拉等十条解决劳动力的经验也得到了交流推广，使各农业社普遍找到了解决劳动力的门路。大家赞美这种社会主义大协作是：大家的死宝变活宝，共同跃进有保证。
    本报讯　记者邓子常报道：为适应农业生产大跃进的新形势，河北省交河县广泛开展乡与乡、社与社、队与队之间的社会主义大协作（即大互助）运动，出现了先进带动落后、加快播种进度、继续掀起水利高潮等新气象，并且进一步提高了农民群众的思想觉悟。
    这个县所有农业社都是村社、力量不够大，开始播种春麦后，便把水利建设几乎挤得全部停顿了。洼里王乡各农业社第一个尝试了大协作，它们集中六百名劳动力，鏖战四昼夜，在一千五百亩没有水利设施的地里打成一百五十眼“互助井”，作到基本实现水利化。中共交河县委发现了这一新创举，立即进行了调查研究，认为这是达到用先进者帮助落后者共同进步、保证各项生产工作齐头跃进的正确途径，及时加以总结和推广。从3月下旬以来，这一运动在全县范围内逐步形成。
    交河县的大协作有四种形式：一是几个乡联合突击某项大型工程的协作，现在还是少数；二是全乡所有农业社的联合协助，现在已被70％以上的乡所采用；三是几个农业社之间的协作；四是农业社内部各生产队之间的协作。参加大协作的社员，劳动报酬一般采取以下办法：小型的换工互助；大型的由农业社出义务工，社员在本社记工；给社员记工分，按一般社的工值计算，由工程受益的农业社给予报酬。大协作的范围，最初只是在人力上，现已包括物力、财力等；开始协作仅限于搞水利工程，逐渐发展到播种和浇地，以及办联合农具加工厂等。
    这种大协作的好处，主要在于可以集中足够的力量，突击完成一个乡、社或队所不能单独完成的紧急任务。例如，东辛店乡曾有八个农业社由于力量单薄，无法改造利用十二个大坑的积水，解决不了浇地问题。这个乡的其他农业社发挥互助精神，联合派去二千四百多个男女劳力，自带工具、粮食，突击两昼夜，就使八个社的80％耕地具备了水利化的条件。与此同时，全县所有农业社还以乡为单位，成立了十八个联合农具加工厂，共投入有铁、木工技术的社员四百二十三人，投资二万八千多元，投铁料十万多斤和木料一百五十四立方公尺。到目前，这些加工厂已为农业社生产出简易提水工具二十三种一千三百多套，新式播种器械六种三千八百多部，水车零件三千二百多件等。
    目前，交河县的大协作运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展，并且越来越显示出它的巨大作用。在水利建设方面，投入的劳动力已达七万多人，新修工程共可扩大浇地面积十八万亩以上。在春耕生产方面，抗旱抢种大田作物的日进度，也由一万一千多亩提高为一万九千多亩。同时，农民群众的社会主义思想觉悟也因此有了进一步的提高。只营子乡就有十个村的二十一户单干农民，亲身体验到大互助的好处，积极申请参加了农业社。
