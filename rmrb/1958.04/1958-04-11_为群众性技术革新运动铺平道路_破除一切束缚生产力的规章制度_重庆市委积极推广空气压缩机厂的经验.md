To pave the way for the mass technological innovation movement, eliminate all rules and regulations that hinder productivity.
Chongqing Municipal Party Committee Actively Promotes the Experience of the Air Compressor Factory
　　(Our newspaper, Chongqing, April 10th) The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee convened an on-site conference on opposing conservatism and breaking old rules on the afternoon of March 3rd, mobilizing all factory, mining, and enterprise units in the city to learn from the experience of the Chongqing Air Compressor Factory. The aim was to mobilize the masses to conduct a special "speaking out" and debate campaign during the "Double Anti" movement, targeting rules and regulations, to abolish the old and establish the new.
　　The Chongqing Air Compressor Factory had a total of 656 rules and regulations and more than 1,800 types of forms and reports. After mobilizing the workers to speak out freely and debate extensively, and put forward revision opinions, it abolished and revised 72.87% of the rules and regulations and more than half of the forms and reports in less than half a month. According to the original old rules, every time a worker came up with an advanced experience, they had to break through at least four systems – technological regulations, rationalization proposal approval procedures, work-in-progress inspection, and material, tool, and cutter requisition systems. Taking technological regulations as an example, the original regulations stipulated that any revision of a regulation had to go through eight levels of approval. Some process personnel, regardless of the production effect, believed that as long as it complied with the technological regulations, it was good; otherwise, even if the product was qualified, it was illegal. The approval of rationalization proposals also had to go through twelve levels of approval, so a proposal often dragged on for several months, some even taking seven or eight months to be realized. The slogan put forward by the workers this time was: "Eliminate all outdated rules and regulations to pave the way for technological innovation!" At the beginning, a few people secretly experimented and created many advanced experiences and new records, which attracted the attention of the leadership. Subsequently, the factory director, party committee secretary, chief engineer, and heads of key departments formed a work group and went deep into the workshops to create "experimental fields" for breaking old rules, vigorously supporting the workers. At the same time, technological innovation performances were held on site. In this way, the workers made public many projects that they had been secretly experimenting with. The results of the first eight technological innovation performances greatly improved production efficiency and also guaranteed product quality. The leaders approved these advanced operating methods on the spot, promoting a mass movement of opposing conservatism and breaking old rules.
　　The factory implemented the spirit of "breaking and establishing simultaneously," conducting a mass review of rules and regulations. In the past, no matter which process's technological regulations were to be modified in the production workshop, it was necessary to fill out three forms and go through eight approval procedures. After this reform, it was only necessary to fill out a "Technological Modification Permit," and the general technological modification authority was delegated to the workshop for decision. The approval authority for rationalization proposals was also generally delegated to the workshops and work sections, which greatly shortened the realization period of proposals. Breaking with convention in the trial production of new products, in the past, considerable time was wasted from design, formulation of process procedures, calculation of man-hour quotas, and formulation of materials, etc., and a sample of a new product could not be produced in half a year. This time, in the trial production of a three-cubic-meter air compressor, it would have taken at least three quarters to produce it according to the original procedures, but now it only took twelve days to successfully trial-produce it.
　　Due to the abolition and modification of some unreasonable or incompletely reasonable rules and regulations and forms and reports, the staff and workers felt happy, which aroused a mass upsurge of technological innovation. The number of rationalization proposals from the entire factory in the most recent half month exceeded the numbers of the previous two or three months. Many workers are full of energy during the day for production and engage in experiments at night, and production efficiency is rapidly improving. Because of improved technical operations, the four work sections in the third workshop, with a total of 225 workers, have seen 208 people set up leap forward plans, striving to complete one and a half to two days' worth of tasks in one day in April.
　　With the major reform of rules and regulations, a series of reforms in enterprise management and technical management have been promoted. According to preliminary calculations of the entire factory, more than 70 staff members can be streamlined as a result.
　　The Chongqing Air Compressor Factory mobilized staff and workers to break old rules, starting with rules and regulations directly related to production, from scattered to systematic, from incomplete to complete. At the same time, attention was paid to specific analysis, and those that should be retained were resolutely implemented. (Liao Yongxiang)

    为群众性技术革新运动铺平道路
    破除一切束缚生产力的规章制度
    重庆市委积极推广空气压缩机厂的经验
    本报重庆10日电　中共重庆市委3日下午召开了反保守、破陈规的现场会议，动员全市厂矿企业单位学习重庆空气压缩机厂的经验，发动群众，在双反运动中针对规章制度进行一次专题鸣放，破旧立新。
    重庆空气压缩机厂共有六百五十六项规章制度，一千八百多种表报，经过发动职工大鸣大放、大争大辩，提出修改意见，不到半月即已废除、修改规章制度72.87％和表报的半数以上。按原有陈规，工人中每出现一项先进经验至少必须冲破四种制度——工艺规程、合理化建议审批程序、工序检验和材料、工具、刀具领发制度。单拿工艺规程来说，原来规定修改任何一项规程都要经过八道关口。有些工艺人员，不问生产效果如何，只要合乎工艺规程就认为是好的，否则即使产品合格，也是非法的。合理化建议的审批也要经过十二道关口，所以一个建议常常要拖几个月，有的甚至七、八个月也实现不了。这次工人们提出的口号是：“除掉一切陈旧的规章制度，为技术革新铺平道路！”开始的时候，少数人偷偷地试验，创造了很多先进经验、新纪录，引起了领导上的重视。接着，厂长、党委书记、总工程师，以及主要科室负责人组成工作组，深入车间搞破除陈规的“试验田”，大力支持职工。同时在现场举行革新技术表演。这样，工人们就把偷偷试验的许多项目公开出来了。第一次八项革新技术表演的结果，大大提高了生产效率，也保证了产品的质量。领导人当场批准了这些先进的操作方法，推动了群众性的反保守、破陈规的运动。
    全厂贯彻“边破边立”的精神；对规章制度展开群众性的审查。过去生产车间不论修改哪道工序的工艺规程，必须填写三次表报，经过八道审批手续；这次改革后，只填写“工艺修改许可书”就行了，一般工艺修改权交给了车间决定。合理化建议的审批权限，一般也放到了车间和工段决定，这就大大地缩短了建议的实现期限。试制新产品也打破了常规，以往从设计、制定工艺加工程序，计算工时定额，制定材料等，前后耽搁不少的时间，一件新产品半年都拿不出样品来。这次试制三立方公尺的空气压缩机，如按原有程序至少要三个季度才能制出来，现在只花十二天的工夫就试制成功了。
    由于破除和修改了一些不合理或不完全合理的规章制度、表报，职工们心情舒畅，激起了群众性的革新技术的热潮。全厂最近半个月的合理化建议数字，超过已往两、三个月的数字。很多工人白天生龙活虎搞生产，晚上搞试验，生产效率飞速提高。第三车间四个工段共二百二十五个工人，因改进技术操作提高了生产效率，有二百零八人订出跃进计划，争取4月份一人完成一天半到两天以上的任务。
    随着规章制度的大改革，推进了企业管理和技术管理上的一系列改革，全厂根据初步计算，可以因此精简出工作人员七十多人。
    重庆空气压缩机厂发动职工破除陈规，首先从跟生产有直接关系的规章制度着手，由零星到系统，由不成套到成套；同时注意具体分析，对应予保留的坚决贯彻执行。　（廖永祥）
