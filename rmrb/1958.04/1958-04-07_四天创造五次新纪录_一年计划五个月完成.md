    Five New Records in Four Days
    One Year Plan Completed in Five Months

    (Our dispatch from Guangzhou, April 6th) Steelmaking workers in the steel furnace section of the new steel casting workshop at the state-owned Guangzhou General Machinery Factory, boldly broke with convention and innovated technology, continuously creating five new records in four days. Among them, the Zhang Hanming steelmaking team created a new record on March 16th by refining a furnace of three tons of carbon steel in just two hours and four minutes.

    The new steel casting workshop was officially put into production at the beginning of March. The capacity of the new steel furnace is three tons. Initially, because the steelmaking workers had not figured out the performance of the new steel furnace, it took seven hours to refine each furnace of steel. Later, the time was gradually shortened, stabilizing at a level of four hours and fifty-seven minutes. After repeated research, Zhang Hanming and his team members decided to break with convention, innovate technology, and further shorten the steelmaking time. On March 13th, they created a new record of refining a furnace of steel in just two hours and fifty minutes. On the 14th, the He Haiqing steelmaking team caught up with them, using only two hours and forty-eight minutes to refine a furnace of steel. On March 16th, the Zhang Hanming team again created a new record of refining a furnace of steel in two hours and four minutes. At this speed, plus the resumption of production of the old steel furnace, the original task of refining 4,000 tons of steel parts this year can be completed in May. (Du Bian)

    四天创造五次新纪录
    一年计划五个月完成
    本报广州6日电  国营广州通用机器厂新铸钢车间钢炉工段的炼钢工人，大胆打破陈规，革新技术，连续在四天中创造了五次新纪录。其中张汉明炼钢小组于3月16日更创造了炼一炉三吨的炭素钢只要二小时零四分的新纪录。
    新铸钢车间是3月初正式投入生产的。新钢炉的容量是三吨，起初由于炼钢工人没有摸透新钢炉的性能，每炼一炉钢要七个小时，以后逐渐缩短，稳定在四小时五十七分的水平上。张汉明和组员们反复研究后，便决定打破陈规，革新技术，进一步缩短炼钢时间。3月13日，他们创造了炼一炉钢只要二小时五十分的新纪录。14日，何海清炼钢小组赶上了他们，只用二小时四十八分炼一炉钢。16日，张汉明小组又创造二小时零四分炼一炉钢的新纪录。按照这个速度，加上旧钢炉恢复生产，五月份就可以完成原定的今年炼四千吨钢件的任务。（杜编）
