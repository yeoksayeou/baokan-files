    The Sparrow's Delicacy
    Zheng Youde
    Sparrows are lazy and greedy pests that harm crops. Although they are always flying around everywhere, appearing very "spirited," they have a fatal weakness—delicacy.
    The sparrow's wings are short, small, and weak, unable to fly long distances. Their usual range of activity is generally within four or five *li*; their flight altitude is generally within ten or twenty meters. But even for such a short distance, they have to fly for a while and rest for a while. If they are not allowed to rest, and are forced to fly continuously for more than an hour, they will become exhausted, and even fall to the ground and die.
    The sparrow's delicacy is also manifested in its inability to endure hunger. If it cannot find any food within a day and night, it will also starve to death. In addition, its nerves are very fragile: it cannot tolerate loud noises or see red things. As soon as it hears any noise or sees red things, it must quickly escape. Once night falls, the sparrow must return to its nest to rest. In the dark, it cannot see anything.
    Weak and feeble, unable to endure hunger, afraid of noise, and blind at night, the sparrow embodies all forms of delicacy. We use methods of bombing, hitting, poisoning, and raiding nests, precisely targeting its weaknesses, to put it to death.

    麻雀的娇气
    郑幼德
    麻雀是又懒又馋、损害庄稼的坏东西。虽然它总是到处飞踏，似乎很“神气”，但是它有一个致命的弱点——娇气。
    麻雀的两翅短小无力，不能远走高飞，平时活动的范围一般在四、五里以内；飞行高度一般在一、二十公尺。但就是这么一段路程，它也得飞一会、歇一会，如果不让它停歇，逼它连续飞行一小时以上，它就会疲惫不堪，甚至自行坠地而死。
    麻雀的娇气还表现在不能耐饥。如果它在一昼夜内吃不到一点食物，也就会饿死。另外，它的神经很脆弱：听不得大声音响，看不得红色的东西。一有什么响动或者见到红色东西，就要赶快逃避。一到夜晚，麻雀就要回巢休息。黑夜里，它什么也瞧不见。
    软弱无力、不能耐饥、害怕嘈杂、黑夜失明，麻雀集其娇气之大成。我们用轰、打、毒、掏的办法，正是针对它的弱点，置它于死地。
