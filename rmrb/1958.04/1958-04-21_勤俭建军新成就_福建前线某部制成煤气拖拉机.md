Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Frontline, April 20th: A vehicle repair shop of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian Frontline today successfully trial-produced the "Young Pioneer" coal gas tractor for the first time.

This wood-burning tractor has fifteen horsepower. It can be used for plowing in dry land and paddy fields (simply by swapping its iron wheels and rubber wheels), and can also be used as a power machine for pumping water and milling rice. With a trailer, it can also haul two tons of goods, consuming only one kilogram of charcoal fuel per kilometer of operation.

The materials used to manufacture this tractor, apart from two new rubber tires, were all old materials from the vehicle repair shop.

    勤俭建军新成就
    福建前线某部制成煤气拖拉机
    据新华社福建前线20日电　福建前线人民解放军某部汽车修理厂，今天第一次试制成“红领巾”煤气拖拉机。
    这台烧木炭的拖拉机有十五马力，它可在旱地、水田里耕种（只要把它备有的铁轮和胶轮倒换一下），并可作为抽水、碾米的动力机。带上拖车，还可以拖运二吨重的货物，运行一公里只消耗一公斤木炭的燃料。
    制造这台拖拉机的材料，除二个新胶轮外，其余都是利用汽车修理厂内的旧材料。
