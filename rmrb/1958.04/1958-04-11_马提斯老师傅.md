    Master Matthias
    In the German Democratic Republic's state-owned Berlin Oberschöneweide Transformer Factory, no one doesn't say that Comrade Matthias is a master craftsman who is hard to find even with a lantern. The young men have an indescribable respect and trust for him. And when Master Matthias sees these lively and carefree young men, he feels genuinely happy from the bottom of his heart, wishing he could impart all his skills to them at once, allowing them to quickly grow into skilled technicians.
    Of course, looking at these happy young people, Matthias can't help but think of his own past, filled with hardship and bitterness. At that time, he was an apprentice in a factory owned by the big capitalist Thyssen. In the first year, he spent every day running errands for his master: buying beer, buying cigarettes, relaying messages. In short, being an apprentice meant being a servant, learning nothing. In the second year, he finally made it to the day when the factory gave him a machine tool. He knew very well that it was a piece of old junk that no one wanted, but having it was better than being a servant. He had a machine tool, but no one taught him how to use it. Back then, learning a skill from the master was as difficult as climbing to the sky. Because everyone was worried about losing their jobs, no one wanted to teach their skills to others, always wanting to keep something for themselves. After completing his apprenticeship, he had to work an average of thirteen or fourteen hours a day in the factory, and the factory never paid a penny of overtime. At night, when Matthias dragged his exhausted body off work, there wasn't even hot water to wash the oil off his hands. Matthias worked hard and practiced diligently in such a harsh environment, and it was only with great difficulty that he acquired a good set of skills.
    After liberation, the blood-sucking big bosses were kicked out, and the factory returned to the hands of the people. Matthias became a master craftsman at the state-owned Berlin Oberschöneweide Transformer Factory. The fate of the apprentices in the factory was completely different from Matthias's experiences in the past. The factory specially built a cultural center for them and paid for them to study and improve their skills. Apprentices could also go to summer camps by the Baltic Sea for two weeks every year.
    Now Master Matthias has eighty-two apprentices. He is very concerned about their production practice. He always teaches them to be orderly, polite, and not to be careless in their work. He doesn't allow apprentices to smoke in the training factory, and he doesn't approve of them having pompadour hairstyles that sway in front of people. At the same time, he doesn't want to see them wearing gaudy American-style "monkey shirts," chewing gum, and acting like hoodlums that no decent person can stand.
    Master Matthias cherishes the younger generation as he cherishes the apple of his eye. He hopes to train his apprentices not only to become experts in production, but also to become people with progressive ideas, thrift, and a proper work style.

    马提斯老师傅
    在德意志民主共和国国营柏林欧本鲜尼韦德变压器工厂里，没有一个人不说马提斯同志是个打着灯笼都找不到的好师傅。小伙子们对他都有一种说不出的敬爱和信任。而当马提斯老师傅一看到这些生龙活虎、无忧无虑的小伙子的时候，简直是打心眼里感到愉快，恨不得一下子把他的本领都教给他们，让他们迅速成长为熟练的技工。
    当然，看着这些幸福的青年人，马提斯就要连想起自己那充满了苦难和酸辛的过去。那时他在大财阀蒂森的一家工厂里当学徒。头一年，每天都是给师傅打杂：买啤酒、买香烟、传话，一句话，当学徒就是当仆人，什么也学不到。第二年，好不容易熬到了那么一天，厂里给了他一部机床，他明知道这是谁也不要的一架老废物，但是有它总比当仆人强。机床是有了，可是没人教。那时候要想从师傅那里学点手艺比登天还难。因为谁都担心失业，都不愿意把本事教给别人，自己总想留一手。学徒期满以后，他在厂里每天平均要工作十三、四个钟头，而工厂从来没给过一分钱的加班费。夜晚，当马提斯拖着疲劳不堪的身体下工的时候，连洗去手上油泥的热水都没有。马提斯在这样艰苦的环境下勤学苦练，好不容易才有了一身好本事。
    解放以后，吸血为生的大老板滚蛋了，工厂回到了人民的手里。马提斯成了国营柏林欧本鲜尼韦德变压器工厂的老师傅。厂里的学徒们的命运和马提斯当年的遭遇完全不同了。工厂为他们专门修建了文化馆，出钱帮助他们学习深造。学徒们每年还可以到波罗的海边上的夏令营去休假两周。
    现在马提斯老师傅有八十二个学徒。他非常关心他们的生产实习。他总是教导他们要守秩序、有礼貌，在工作上要一丝一毫都不能马虎。他不让学徒们在实习工厂里抽烟，不同意他们留一头阿飞式的头发在人们面前摇来摆去。同时，他也不愿意看见他们穿着花花绿绿的美国式“猴子衬衫”，嘴里嚼着口香糖，像个二流子似的叫任何正派人都看不惯。
    马提斯老师傅像爱护自己的眼珠一样爱护青年一代。他希望把他的徒弟训练得不仅成为生产上的能手，并且也成为思想进步、勤俭朴素、作风正派的人。
