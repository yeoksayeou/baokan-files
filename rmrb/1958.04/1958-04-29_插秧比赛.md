    Rice Transplanting Competition
    The Xindong Agricultural Cooperative in Dongchuan Township, Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, recently held a rice transplanting competition. Twenty-eight of the cooperative's best rice transplanting experts participated. At the sound of the whistle, they all entered the field and showed off their skills. As a result of the competition, Hu Xiangeng won the championship. In fifty-seven minutes, he transplanted a total of 2,910 clusters using the 4x6 close planting method. The transplanting was straight and even, and each cluster met the requirements. At this standard, he could transplant more than one mu per eight-hour day, while the average intermediate rice transplanting expert can only transplant three to four fen of land per day. The Zhejiang Daily published a report on this competition on the first page on the 25th, and published an illustrated explanation of Hu Xiangeng's advanced rice transplanting method. The newspaper also published a short commentary criticizing the view that agricultural labor is not highly technical and only requires physical strength, pointing out that improving rice transplanting techniques is also a key to solving the current labor shortage difficulties in spring plowing and transplanting.

    插秧比赛
    浙江缙云县东川乡新东农业社最近举行了一次插秧比赛。参加比赛的有全社最好的二十八个插秧能手，哨音一响，一齐下田，各显神通。比赛结果，胡献庚夺得冠军。他在五十七分钟内，共插4×6密植二千九百零十丛。插得又直又匀，丛丛符合要求，按照这个标准，一天八小时能插一亩多，而一般中等插秧能手平均每天只能插三至四分田。浙江日报25日一版对这次比赛作了报道，并刊出了胡献庚先进插秧法图解。报纸还发表短评，批判了那种认为农业劳动技术性不强、只要有力气就行的观点，指出提高插秧操作技术也是解决当前春耕插秧中劳力不足困难的一个关键。
