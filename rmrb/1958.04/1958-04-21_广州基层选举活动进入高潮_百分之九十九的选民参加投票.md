Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 20th: The grassroots election activities in Guangzhou have entered a climax. In recent days, Guangzhou has been filled with the sound of drums and music. From four or five in the morning, some polling stations have been crowded with people waiting to vote.

In Huaqiao New Village, where voting began on the 18th, many returned overseas Chinese received ballots for the first time. Huang Ying, an overseas Chinese who returned from the United States last year, saw through the ugly farce of sham democracy in which the big bourgeoisie used money to buy votes during his forty years of living abroad. After seeing reports of the general election in his motherland in the newspapers, he always longed to exercise his democratic rights one day. Now, this wish has finally come true. He was so excited that he picked up his camera and took several touching shots.

The enthusiasm of the street residents is even higher, and many street activists have worked hard all night to decorate the venue. In the electoral districts where elections have already begun, the vast majority of voters have cast their ballots. In many electoral districts that have already concluded, the number of participants who voted is above 99%. In the Zhujiang District, which has the largest population mobility, the number of participants who voted is also higher than in the previous general election, with one electoral district reaching 100% voter turnout. Some waterborne residents activists also volunteered to accompany the general election work team, carrying mobile ballot boxes to Jiangmen, Dongguan, and other places, to facilitate voters producing there to vote on the spot. More than a dozen ocean-going ships that had not returned home sent telegrams to participate in the voting.

The grassroots election work in Guangzhou is expected to be completed by the 25th. (Attached picture)

    广州基层选举活动进入高潮
    百分之九十九的选民参加投票
    新华社广州20日电　广州市人民基层选举的活动进入了高潮。连日以来，广州市处处鼓乐声喧，自清晨四、五时起，有些投票站里就挤满了等候投票的人们。
    18日开始投票选举的华侨新村，不少归侨都是第一次接到选票。去年才回国的旅美华侨黄英，离开祖国的四十年中，在美国看透了大资产阶级用钱收买选票的假民主丑剧。当他从报纸上看到祖国普选的报道之后，总渴望有一天自己也能行使民主权利。现在，这个愿望终于实现了，他兴奋得拿起照相机，一连拍了好几个动人的镜头。
    街道群众热情更高，许多街坊积极分子为布置会场苦战通宵。已经开始选举的各个选区，绝大部分的选民都投了票。许多已结束的选区，参加投票的人数都在99％以上。人口流动最大的珠江区，参加投票的人数也比上届普选时多，有一个选区投票人数达到百分之百。有些水上居民积极分子还自动随同普选工作队，携带流动票箱去江门、东莞等地，便利在那里生产的选民就地投票选举。十多艘远航未归的海轮，都纷纷拍电报回来，参加了投票。
    广州市的基层选举工作，预计在25日可以全部结束。（附图片）
    今年广州市郊区农村中的基层选举工作，紧密结合着当前生产任务进行。这是流动票箱来到田头，使正在田间生产的社员方便地投下了神圣的一票。
