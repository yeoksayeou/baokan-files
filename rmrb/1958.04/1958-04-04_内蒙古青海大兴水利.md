Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 3rd: A large-scale water conservancy construction program has begun in the pastoral areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Upon completion of various water conservancy projects in the pastoral areas this year, they will provide sufficient drinking water for 2.5 million head of livestock and irrigate more than 18,000 hectares of forage base and grassland.

    An autonomous region pastoral area water conservancy work team, equipped with drilling rigs and water conservancy machinery, has now been divided into twenty groups to enter the grasslands separately. This year, they will drill more than 400 mechanized wells and deep water tube wells for the herdsmen.

    Inner Mongolia has 760,000 square kilometers of natural grassland. Among them, only 480,000 square kilometers of pastureland have abundant water sources and can be used regularly. Constructing water conservancy projects in pastoral areas can make full use of the vast grasslands.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 3rd: In the high and cold mountainous areas of the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, farmers of all ethnic groups are working day and night to build water conservancy projects. All sixteen main canals, with a total length of more than 1,600 li, have started construction within two or three days. The work of building canals to bring water up the mountains and drilling wells in river valleys is progressing simultaneously.

    Huzhu Tu Autonomous County is China's only Tu autonomous county. It is located in the high and cold mountainous area on the north bank of the Huangshui River and has 80,000 male and female laborers, each responsible for fourteen mu of cultivated land. In order to ensure that the existing 700,000 mu of dry land can be irrigated, some responsible cadres of the county's party and government leading organs have gone down to the construction sites to take responsibility for sections of the canals and lead the construction. A few days ago, Zhang Guosheng, Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, visited the main canal construction site and labored alongside the canal-building masses.

    内蒙古青海大兴水利
    据新华社呼和浩特3日电　内蒙古自治区大规模的牧区水利建设事业已经开始。今年牧区各项水利工程完成后，可以使二百五十万头牲畜得到充足饮水，并能灌溉一万八千多公顷的饲料基地和草原。
    一支备有打井机和水利机械的自治区牧区水利工作队，现在已分成二十个小组分头进入草原，他们今年要给牧民打出四百多眼机井和深水筒井。
    内蒙古有七十六万平方公里的天然大草原。其中水源充沛、能够经常利用的牧场只有四十八万平方公里，在牧区兴修水利，可以使广阔的草原得到充分利用。
    据新华社西宁3日电　在高寒山区的互助土族自治县，各民族农民昼夜大修水利。全长一千六百多里的十六条干渠，在两三天之中全部动工。修渠引水上山和在川水地打井的工作，正在齐头并进。
    互助土族自治县是我国唯一的土族自治县，它位于湟水北岸高寒山区，有男女劳动力八万人，每个劳动力要负担十四亩耕地。这个县为了使现有的七十多万亩旱地能浇上苗水，党政领导机关的一些负责干部都下了工地，按渠包干负责，领导施工。前几天，中共青海省委书记张国声曾经到干渠工地进行视察，并且同修渠群众一起劳动。
