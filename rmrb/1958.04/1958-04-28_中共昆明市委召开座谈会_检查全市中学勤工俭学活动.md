    Kunming Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Holds Symposium to Inspect Work-Study Programs in City's Middle Schools
    (Our reporter Huang Changlu reports) The Kunming Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a symposium in early April to inspect the work-study programs in the city's middle schools. It also proposed solutions to the problems discovered during the inspection to gradually bring the work-study movement onto the right track.

    Speeches at the symposium indicated that the work-study activities carried out by thirty-five middle schools in Kunming City in the past two months were characterized by quick action, high enthusiasm, and significant achievements. After two months of physical labor, tens of thousands of middle school students in the city have generally enhanced their labor perspective, initially mastered certain labor skills, deepened their understanding of book knowledge, and had a positive impact on society. Many people praised, "Today's students can wield small pens and also wield big pens (referring to production tools)."

    Precisely because this movement has gained momentum so rapidly, neither school leaders nor students have experience in work-study programs, and ideological work has not been done sufficiently since the movement began. Therefore, some problems have also emerged in some schools. The current problems are that ordinary middle schools lack the means of production, labor opportunities are extremely unstable, and it is difficult to directly integrate labor with teaching, which needs to be carefully arranged. The meeting believed that secondary vocational schools can, under certain conditions, achieve full or partial self-sufficiency in funding within a certain period. For ordinary middle schools, it is only required to use income from work-study programs to reduce a portion of the state's administrative expenses and student grants to the schools, and strive to gradually implement full self-funded education.

    The meeting believed that it is appropriate for students in urban ordinary middle schools to participate in labor for sixty days each year, about half of which is for voluntary labor inside and outside the school. These sixty days of labor should take up twenty days each of winter and summer vacations, Sundays, and class time. In this way, only half a day of class time is taken up each week on average, which can ensure that it will not affect learning. As for ordinary middle schools in suburban areas, they can work for three months each year, concentrated during the busy farming season. The avenues for production for ordinary middle schools are mainly to sign long-term contracts with factories and handicraft cooperatives near the schools, with students taking turns to work in the factories and cooperatives. The second is to jointly establish handicraft workshops. Doing so will fix the labor time, facilitate the arrangement of teaching, and cultivate students' labor skills and collectivist ideology. Suburban middle schools will mainly participate in agricultural and sideline production labor on school farms and agricultural cooperatives.

    In order to make overall arrangements for work-study programs in the city's middle schools and avoid the chaos that occurred in the previous period, the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the opinions of the symposium, decided that the Municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Department, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Industry Bureau, the Labor Bureau, and other relevant departments should form a city-wide work-study leading organization. This organization will be responsible for dividing the schools into several districts based on their distribution and assisting the schools in signing contracts with factories and handicraft cooperatives in their respective areas.

### 中共昆明市委召开座谈会  检查全市中学勤工俭学活动

    中共昆明市委召开座谈会
    检查全市中学勤工俭学活动
    本报讯　记者黄昌禄报道：中共昆明市委4月上旬召开座谈会检查全市中等学校的勤工俭学活动，并针对检查中发现的问题提出了解决办法，以便将勤工俭学运动逐步纳入正轨。
    座谈会上的发言说明，两个月来，昆明市三十五所中等学校开展勤工俭学活动的特点是动作快、劲头足、成绩大。全市几万名中学生经过两个月体力劳动后，劳动观点普遍有所增强，初步掌握了一定的劳动技能，加深了对书本知识的理解，并在社会上产生了良好影响，许多人称赞：“现在的学生会拿小笔杆，也会拿大笔杆（指生产工具）。”
    正因为这个运动来势迅猛，从学校领导到学生对勤工俭学都没经验，加以运动开展起来之后，思想工作做得不够，因此，在部分学校中也出现了一些问题。目前问题是普通中学没有生产资料，劳动门路极不固定，与教学直接结合较难，需要很好加以安排。会议认为，中等专业学校可根据条件在一定时期内作到经费全部或部分自给，而对普通中学，只要求用勤工俭学收入减少国家给学校的一部分行政费和助学金，争取逐步实行全部自费读书。
    会议认为，城市普通中学学生每年参加劳动六十天为宜，其中约一半系参加校内外的义务劳动。这六十天劳动，占用寒暑假、星期日和上课时间各二十天，这样，平均每周只占用半天上课时间，就能保证不会影响学习。至于郊区的普通中学每年可劳动三个月，集中在农忙时进行。普通中学的生产门路，主要同学校附近的工厂、手工业社签订长期合同，学生轮流进厂进社作工；其次是联合建立手工业作坊。这样作，劳动时间固定，便于安排教学，又可以培养学生的劳动技能与集体主义思想。郊区的中学则以参加学校农场和农业社的农副业劳动为主。
    为了将全市中等学校的勤工俭学加以统筹安排，避免前段时间出现过的紊乱现象，中共昆明市委根据座谈会的意见，决定由市委文教部、市教育局、工业局、劳动局等有关部门组成全市勤工俭学领导机构，由这个机构负责依据学校分布情况划分若干区，帮助各校同所在区域内的工厂和手工业社签订合同。
