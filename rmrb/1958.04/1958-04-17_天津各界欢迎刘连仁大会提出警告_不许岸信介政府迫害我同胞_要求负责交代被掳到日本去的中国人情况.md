Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th: Over two thousand people from all walks of life in Tianjin held a grand rally today to welcome compatriot Liu Lianren back to the embrace of the motherland after being persecuted by Japanese militarists for fourteen years. Leading members of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee, representatives of various democratic parties, Peng Yan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Red Cross Society of China, Ji Feng, Director of the International Liaison Department, and representatives from the Shandong Provincial Red Cross Society attended the meeting. Representatives from the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, who arrived in Tianjin on the Japanese ship "Hakusan Maru," as well as the eighth group of escorts of the remains of Chinese martyrs headed by Seiichiro Sato, and Japanese journalists accompanying the ship were also invited to attend the meeting. When Liu Lianren arrived at the venue, the crowd applauded him warmly, shouting slogans such as "Welcome Liu Lianren Home!"

Zhang Guofan, Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, first extended a warm welcome to Liu Lianren on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee at the welcome rally. Zhang Guofan said: The Japanese imperialists committed heinous crimes during the Anti-Japanese War, bringing deep disasters and endless suffering to the Chinese people. A large number of innocent civilians were abducted by the Japanese army to Japan to be forced into labor. Liu Lianren's tragic experience is just one of the countless crimes of Japanese militarists. All of this is a blood debt owed by the Japanese militarists to the Chinese people, and Kishi Nobusuke, then a member of the cabinet, also bears an unshirkable responsibility. He said: We must warn the Japanese government to face reality as soon as possible. China is no longer what it was twenty years ago. Our country will not allow any persecution of our people. The Japanese government must compensate Liu Lianren for all his losses and should also give a responsible account of the situation of all Chinese who were abducted to Japan by the Japanese army during the war of aggression against China. Zhang Guofan finally expressed his gratitude to the Japanese people and Japanese friendly organizations who actively promoted Sino-Japanese friendship. (The full text of the speech is on page four.) Zhang Guofan's speech was constantly interrupted by the crowd shouting slogans such as "Demand that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government compensate Liu Lianren for all his losses!" and "The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government must bear all responsibility for the Liu Lianren incident!"

Then, Liu Lianren spoke amidst warm applause. He recounted the persecution suffered by the more than 800 people who were captured and taken to Japan with him. He said, I thank the people of the motherland and the Communist Party of China for rescuing me! I thank the Japanese people and Japanese friendly organizations for taking care of me, but the Japanese government said that I was an "illegal immigrant" and refused to compensate me for my losses. I cannot agree to this!

Wang Wenting, a representative of the families of compatriots abducted to Japan and a staff member of the Beijing Coal Mine Design Institute, said at the meeting that he is a family member of a Chinese citizen who, like Liu Lianren, was enslaved by Japanese militarism and whose whereabouts are still unknown. In the winter of 1943, the Japanese fascist army abducted his father, Wang Fenggang, and his uncle, Wu Baoji, from Yuanshi County, Hebei Province, to Japan to force them into slave labor, and their whereabouts are still unknown to this day. His grandfather was old and weak, unable to support the family, and his eyes were blinded by anger. He ran on the streets day and night, out of his mind, with his hands outstretched, shouting his father's name, and soon died of illness. His grandmother also died of hunger and cold. Wang Wenting said sadly: The Japanese aggressors persecuted my whole family, causing us to be broken up and ruined. This blood feud will never be forgotten. He resolutely demanded that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government be responsible for explaining the whereabouts of his father and uncle and compensate his whole family for all the losses they have suffered.

Wang Wenyuan, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, Fan Shaohan, representative of the Tianjin local organizations of various democratic parties, Xu Guang, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Women's Federation, and Wang Shu'e, a youth representative, also spoke. They unanimously supported compatriot Liu Lianren's protest against the Kishi Nobusuke government and angrily condemned the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government.

Iida Seiichi, a representative of Japanese residents in China who were gathering in Tianjin to return to Japan on the "Hakusan Maru," said at the meeting that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude towards the Liu Lianren incident is completely contrary to the will of the Japanese people, and he said that such behavior will never be allowed. Fujita Shigeru, the representative of the eight former Japanese war criminals who were leniently released by China and were preparing to return to Japan, said at the meeting that he was filled with remorse when he saw Liu Lianren now, and he felt infinite indignation at the inhumane attitude of the Kishi Nobusuke government towards Liu Lianren. He said: On the contrary, the Chinese people have given me, a war criminal with such serious crimes, life and consistent leniency, and released me back to Japan. I swear here: After we return to Japan, we will resolutely oppose war and resolutely fight for peace and for Sino-Japanese friendship.

    天津各界欢迎刘连仁大会提出警告
    不许岸信介政府迫害我同胞
    要求负责交代被掳到日本去的中国人情况
    据新华社天津16日电　天津市各界群众两千多人今天举行盛大集会，欢迎难胞刘连仁在被日本军国主义者迫害十四年之后回到祖国的温暖怀抱。天津市人民委员会负责人，各民主党派代表和中国红十字会总会副秘书长彭炎、国际联络部部长纪锋以及山东省红十字会代表等都参加了大会。随日本轮船“白山丸”到达天津的日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络会三团体代表和以佐藤清一郎为首的第八批中国殉难烈士遗骨护送团和随船日本新闻记者也应邀参加了大会。当刘连仁来到会场的时候，全场群众向他热烈鼓掌。高呼着：“欢迎刘连仁回国”口号。
    天津市副市长张国藩在欢迎大会上首先代表天津市人民委员会对刘连仁回到祖国表示热烈欢迎。张国藩说：日本帝国主义者在抗日战争期间曾经犯下了滔天罪行，给中国人民带来了深重的灾难和无穷的痛苦，大批的无辜贫民被日本军队劫掳到日本去强迫劳役，刘连仁的悲惨遭遇也就是日本军国主义者千万罪行中的一件。所有这些，都是日本军国主义者欠下中国人民的血债，当时内阁成员之一的岸信介也负有不可推卸的责任。他说：我们必须正告日本政府，应该及早面对现实，中国已经不是二十年前的中国了，我们的国家不容许对我国人民进行任何迫害，日本政府必须赔偿刘连仁的一切损失，还应当对侵华战争时期被日军掳到日本去的所有中国人的情况作出负责的交代。张国藩最后对积极促进中日友好的日本人民和日本友好团体表示感谢。（讲话全文见第四版）张国藩的讲话不断被群众“要求日本岸信介政府赔偿刘连仁的一切损失！”“日本岸信介政府必须承担对刘连仁事件的一切责任！”的口号所打断。
    接着，刘连仁在热烈的掌声中讲话。他陈诉了和他一起被抓去的八百多人在日本受到迫害的经过。他说，我感谢祖国人民和中国共产党把我抢救出来！我感谢日本人民、日本的友好团体对我的照顾，但是日本政府却说我是“非法入境”，不赔偿我的损失，我决不能答应！
    被掳到日本去的难胞家属代表、北京煤矿设计院工作人员王文庭在会上讲话说，他是一个和刘连仁同样受日本军国主义奴役而且到今天还下落不明的中国老百姓的家属。1943年冬天，日本法西斯军队从河北省元氏县把他的父亲王凤岗和他的舅舅吴宝吉掳到日本去强迫奴役劳动，直到现在还下落不明。他的祖父年老无力难以养家，眼睛也气瞎了，神经失常，昼夜不归地在大街上奔跑，张着两手喊着他父亲的名字，不久就病死了。他的祖母也在饥寒交迫中死去。王文庭沉痛地说：日本侵略者把我全家迫害得家破人亡，这笔血海深仇是永远忘不了的。他坚决要求日本岸信介政府负责交代他父亲和舅父的下落，赔偿他全家所遭受的一切损失。
    天津市工会联合会副主席王文源、各民主党派天津市地方组织代表范绍韩、天津市妇女联合会副主席徐光、青年代表王树鹗分别讲了话。他们一致支持难胞刘连仁对岸信介政府的抗议，并对日本岸信介政府愤怒地提出了谴责。
    在天津集结准备乘“白山丸”回日本的在华日侨代表饭田清七在会上讲话说，日本岸信介政府对刘连仁事件的态度是完全违反日本人民的意志的，他表示决不允许这种行为。被中国宽大释放准备回日本的前日本八名战争犯罪分子的代表藤田茂在会上说，他现在看见刘连仁时充满了忏悔的心情，而且对岸信介政府对刘连仁的非人道的态度感到无限的愤慨。他说：相反的，中国人民对我这样罪恶严重的战争犯罪分子却给以活命和始终如一的宽大待遇，并且把我释放回日本去。我在这里宣誓：我们回日本后，要坚决反对战争，为争取和平、为中日友好而坚决进行斗争。
