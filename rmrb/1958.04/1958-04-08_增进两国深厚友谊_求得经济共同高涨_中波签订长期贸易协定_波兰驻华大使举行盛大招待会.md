He also said: "The Polish People's Republic considers it very necessary and very beneficial to have long-term economic agreements with all socialist countries, especially with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, because they create better conditions for long-term, more rational arrangements for production tasks in long-term economic plans, and help the production of our two countries to better meet our needs."

This atmosphere and the good results of our negotiations are the best expression of the new type of relations between socialist countries, and are the expression of proletarian internationalism on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideology."

    On behalf of the Chinese government and people, Vice-Premier Chen Yi expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Polish Government Delegation for its efforts to enhance the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Polish peoples and to strengthen the economic cooperation between the two countries.

This has given us great encouragement and support. We are very happy and very grateful." Vice-Chairman Jaroszewicz also suggested that everyone toast to the socialist friendship connecting Poland, China and Romania, and to the great unity of the socialist countries!
