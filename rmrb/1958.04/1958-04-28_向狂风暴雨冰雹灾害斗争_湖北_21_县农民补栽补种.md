Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 27th. Areas in Hubei Province that have suffered from strong winds, heavy rain, and hail disasters are making every effort to fight against these natural disasters.

On the 22nd and 23rd, strong winds and heavy rain appeared in many parts of Hubei Province, along with significant hail. A total of twenty-one counties in the province were affected to varying degrees. During these two days and nights, most of the affected counties experienced winds of level eight to ten, rainfall of 160 to over 200 millimeters, and a large amount of hail. Summer harvest crops, rice seedlings, and cotton seedlings in the affected counties all suffered losses to varying degrees. Unfortunately, there were also casualties among people and livestock. Mianyang, Tianmen, and Jingmen in the Jingzhou Special District and Hanchuan and Hanyang in the Xiaogan Special District suffered relatively severe losses.

After the disaster occurred, Party and government leading departments immediately took emergency measures to organize the masses to rescue the affected crops, replant rice and cotton, and resettle disaster victims. In Mianyang County, more than 2,000 cadres were mobilized to lead the masses in fighting the disaster through a method of assigned responsibility. In Tianmen County, the leading authorities immediately organized more than 1,000 county and district cadres to go to the affected areas to fully organize the masses to carry out rescue and replanting work. Party secretaries and commissioners of other counties and relevant prefectural party committees and special districts, as well as county party secretaries and county heads, personally went deep into the disaster areas to express their condolences and lead the fight.

In the process of fighting against natural disasters, the masses showed a tenacious fighting spirit. People put forward the slogans "Compete with disasters for grain and cotton, and strive for a great leap forward in agriculture!" and "Defeat the storm and rain, man will conquer nature!" Each agricultural cooperative in Hanyang County established a special group to lead the production and disaster relief activities. In Mianyang County, more than 160,000 people participated in rescuing rice seedlings, with more than 10,000 waterwheels. On the evening of the 22nd, more than 200,000 mu of rice seedlings and cotton seedlings were rescued. Maozui District in this county also used the method of soaking seeds in warm water to re-soak more than 50,000 jin of rice seeds, and did a good job in replanting rice seedlings. After the wind stopped and the rain ceased in Yingshan County, the masses were organized to help save the lodged summer harvest crops, and currently, several thousand mu of wheat have been propped up.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 27th, Hubei Province's condolence groups from all walks of life went to some counties in the Jingzhou and Xiaogan Special Districts, which suffered from strong winds, heavy rain, and hail disasters, on the 26th to express their condolences. The condolence group was composed of more than 100 representatives from all walks of life in the Hubei Province, Wuhan City Party, government, military, and mass organizations. Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Hubei Province, served as the head of the general delegation, and will go deep into the rural areas to study and solve various problems caused by the disaster with the masses, and lead the masses to quickly restore normal production order, and will also distribute some relief funds. In addition, each sub-group has medical teams to treat the injured.

    新华社武汉27日电　湖北省部分遭受狂风、暴雨和冰雹灾害的地区，正在全力向自然灾害斗争。
    22日和23日，湖北省有不少地方出现了狂风、暴雨，同时还下降了较大的冰雹。全省计有二十一个县受到不同程度的灾害。在这两昼夜内，多数受灾县风力达八级到十级，雨量达一百六十公厘到二百公厘以上，冰雹下降量也很大。各受灾县的夏收作物、稻秧、棉苗都因此而受到了不同程度的损失；并且还发生了人畜伤亡的不幸事件。其中荆州专区的沔阳、天门、京山和孝感专区的汉川、汉阳等县损失比较严重。
    灾情发生后，各地党、政领导部门立即采取紧急措施，组织群众进行抢救受灾作物、补种水稻、棉花和安置灾民等。沔阳县动员了二千多干部用分片包干的办法，领导群众向灾害斗争。天门县领导机关立即组织县、区干部一千多人到各灾区去，全力组织群众进行抢救、补种等工作。其他各县和有关地委专区的地委书记、专员和县委书记、县长，都亲自深入灾区进行慰问和领导斗争。
    群众在向自然灾害作斗争的过程中，表现了顽强的斗争精神。人们提出了“与灾害争粮、棉，力争农业大跃进！”“战胜狂风暴雨，人定胜天！”汉阳县各农业社都成立了专门小组来领导生产救灾活动。沔阳县参加抢救秧苗的群众有十六万多人，水车一万多部，22日晚上就抢救出稻秧、棉苗二十多万亩。这个县的茅咀区还用温汤浸种的办法补泡稻种五万多斤，作好了稻秧补种工作。英山县群众在风息雨停后，就组织群众进行扶救倒伏的夏收作物，目前仅小麦就扶起几千亩。
    据新华社武汉27日电　湖北省各界慰问团26日分赴遭受狂风、暴雨、冰雹灾害的荆州、孝感两专区的一些县进行慰问。这个慰问团由湖北省、武汉市党、政、军、群众团体各界代表百多人组成。中共湖北省委书记、湖北省省长张体学任总团长，将深入农村和群众一起研究和解决因灾害而发生的各种问题，领导群众迅速恢复正常的生产秩序，并将发放部分救济款。此外，各分团都带有医疗队，将为受伤群众治疗。
