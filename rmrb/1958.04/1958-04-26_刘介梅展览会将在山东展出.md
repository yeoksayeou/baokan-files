    Liu Jiumei's Past and Present Life Comparison Exhibition will be held in Jinan during the "May Day" holiday. The exhibition opened in Beijing on December 6th last year and closed on April 18th, with 880,000 visitors. The audience generally reflected: "This is a vivid lesson in socialist education." Many people wrote down their thoughts on the spot or held discussions after the visit, taking Liu Jiumei's thoughts as a mirror to examine their own thoughts. Many viewers gained a further understanding of class struggle in rural areas and the development prospects of a new socialist countryside.
