    Too Much Powder on 100-gram Coated Paper
    Please Help Kaishantun Paper Mill

    For several years, our factory has been using 100-gram coated paper supplied by the Kaishantun Paper Mill. We were very excited recently to hear the news that the Kaishantun Paper Mill has been continuously shortening the cooking time for pulp. However, the quality of the 100-gram coated paper produced by this factory is not satisfactory. This type of coated paper has too much powder, and the paper rolls are not clean. During printing, every three or four minutes, after printing about 400 sheets, the powder and impurities falling from the paper mix with the ink on the rubber rollers and congeal like paste, sticking to the rollers and preventing them from rolling smoothly. It is necessary to wipe the rubber rollers and printing plates. Each time we wipe them, the machine has to stop running for more than ten minutes. In this way, in each eight-hour shift, the actual printing time is only three and a half hours. It is estimated that the annual loss due to reduced production from cleaning the machines is worth more than 200,000 yuan. Moreover, because of the excessive powder, the dots on the images cannot be printed or are not fully printed, affecting the beauty of color pictorials.

    This problem has existed for a long time. In the past, we have repeatedly reported our opinions to the Kaishantun Paper Mill and relevant departments, requesting them to find ways to improve it, but no progress has been seen so far. We hope that the employees of the Kaishantun Paper Mill, in the Great Leap Forward in production, can also show the same vigor in creating shorter pulp cooking times and find ways to improve the defect of excessive powder in 100-gram coated paper, striving to achieve world-class advanced levels in paper quality.

### 一百克道林纸上的粉子太多请开山屯造纸厂想办法

    一百克道林纸上的粉子太多
    请开山屯造纸厂想办法
    我厂所用的一百克道林纸，几年来都是由开山屯造纸厂供应。最近听到开山屯造纸厂连续缩短纸浆蒸煮时间的消息，我们非常兴奋。但是这个厂所造的一百克道林纸的质量却不能令人满意。这种道林纸的粉子太多，纸筒里不干净，在印制中间，每隔三、四分钟，印刷到四百张左右时，纸上落下来的粉子、杂质和胶皮辊子上的油墨凝在一起，像浆糊一样粘住辊子不能流利滚动，必须擦洗胶皮辊子和印版。每擦洗一次，机器要停止运转十几分钟。这样，每班工作八小时，实际印刷时间只有三小时半。估计每年因为擦洗机器所减产的损失，值二十多万元。并且由于粉子多，图面上的网点印不上或印不全，影响彩色画报的美观。
    这个问题由来已久，过去我们曾数次向开山屯造纸厂和有关机关反映意见，要求设法改进，但至今未见成效。希望开山屯造纸厂的职工同志在生产大跃进中，也能拿出创造缩短纸浆蒸煮时间的干劲，设法改进一百克道林纸含粉过多的缺点，争取纸的质量达到世界先进水平。
