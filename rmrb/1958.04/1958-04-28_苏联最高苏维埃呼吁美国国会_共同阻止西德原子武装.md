Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: TASS reported on April 26th: The Chairman of the Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Lobanov, and the Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities, Peive, wrote to the Speaker of the US Senate, Nixon, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rayburn, advocating that the people of the Soviet Union and the United States should work together to prevent the West German Bundeswehr from being armed with atomic and rocket weapons. The Chairmen of the two chambers of the Soviet Supreme Soviet requested that the letter be forwarded to the Senate and House of Representatives of the US Congress.

The letter stated that the United States is actively participating in equipping the West German armed forces with atomic and rocket weapons, so it should be fully responsible for all the consequences of this reckless policy that is exacerbating the current international tension.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet believes that if the Polish government's famous proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free and rocket-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is adopted, it would be the first step in establishing a European collective security system.

The letter also stated that the decision of the West German Federal Parliament to equip the West German armed forces with atomic and rocket weapons poses a serious threat to the cause of peace and international security, and can only be regarded as an attempt to obstruct the smooth holding of a summit conference of various countries.

The letter emphasized that in order to prevent a new war from occurring, all peace-loving people in the world must take joint action.

    苏联最高苏维埃呼吁美国国会
    共同阻止西德原子武装
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社26日报道：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院主席洛巴诺夫和民族院主席佩维写信给美国参议院议长尼克松和众议院议长雷朋，主张苏美两国人民共同努力阻止用原子武器和火箭武器武装西德国防军。苏联两院主席要求把这封信转交给美国国会的参议院和众议院。
    信中说，美国正在积极参加用原子武器和火箭武器装备西德武装力量的活动，所以它就应该对这种加剧目前国际紧张局势的轻率政策的全部后果负责。
    苏联最高苏维埃认为，如果采纳波兰政府提出的关于在中欧地区建立无原子武器和火箭武器区的著名的建议，那就是建立欧洲集体安全体系的第一步。
    信中还说，西德联邦议院关于用原子武器和火箭武器装备西德武装力量的决定，给和平事业和国际安全造成严重的威胁，这只能认为是想要阻挠各国高级会议的顺利举行。
    信中着重指出，为了阻止发生新战争，全世界所有爱好和平的人民必须采取共同行动。
