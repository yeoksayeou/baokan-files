Learn from Nantong, Catch up with Nantong, Surpass Nantong
—Excerpts from the Big-Character Poster Exhibition of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's Construction Bureau

Wasted 170 million yuan!

During the First Five-Year Plan, the overhead quota (i.e., management fees and expenses for engineering services) of our ministry's construction enterprises was 14.7% of the workload (i.e., total construction and installation investment), but the actual expenditure reached 17.05%, wasting 51 million yuan. Compared with the actual overhead expenditure of Nantong City Construction Company, we wasted 170 million yuan during the First Five-Year Plan. How shocking! Compare: Overhead expenditure per 10,000 yuan of workload: Nantong City Construction Company (1957): 947 yuan; Ministry average (1957): 1753 yuan. What are the reasons for the waste? See below:

Too many people is a disaster

The ratio of fixed production workers to non-production personnel in our ministry's construction and installation enterprises is two to one. In 1957, there were 68,314 non-production personnel. Compared with the level of Hunan Provincial Construction Company in 1956, where the ratio of production workers to non-production personnel was six to one, there were 45,000 more people, resulting in an additional expenditure of 47.25 million yuan for the whole year. If these people were sent to construction sites to participate in construction, they could complete more than 250 million yuan of workload each year. Compare: The ratio of management personnel to construction and installation workers: Hunan Provincial Construction Company (1956): 14%; Ministry average (1957): 30%; Among them, Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation (1957): 38.5%.

Specific example: Nine people serving one vehicle

In 1957, Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation's Transportation Company had a total of 244 vehicles, served by 636 drivers, 314 management personnel, plus more than 200 loaders and unloaders. Although there were many people serving these vehicles, 60% of the vehicles were often damaged and under repair, and only 97 vehicles were usually in operation. Calculated based on the number of vehicles frequently in operation, there were an average of six drivers and three management personnel per vehicle. Nine people managing one vehicle, they could carry it away!

Boundless welfare

Welfare expenses account for about 28% of the actual overhead expenditure. Preliminary calculations show that at least more than half of it was wasted during the First Five-Year Plan.
Compare: Welfare subsidies per person per year: Hunan Provincial Construction Company (1956): 36.2 yuan; Ministry average (1957): 78.2 yuan; Among them, Installation Corporation (1957): 104.1 yuan.

Specific example: Few patients, many doctors

The Pingguoyuan Clinic of the Fourth Engineering Company directly under the ministry sees only sixty or seventy patients a day, but has five doctors, six nurses, two pharmacists, three administrators, and two handymen. In addition, there is an ambulance and a driver. Since 1956, this company has also arbitrarily revised the labor insurance regulations, changing the reimbursement rate for family medical expenses from 50% to 80%, greatly encouraging the "enthusiasm" of employees' families for seeing doctors. In 1957, this company completed a total of just over 4 million yuan of workload, but spent 162,000 yuan on medical expenses alone!

Wearing a raincoat while holding an umbrella

The Second Installation Company, under the Ninth Metallurgical Construction Corporation, has 600 workers but 406 raincoats and 526 umbrellas. Most workers can receive both a raincoat and an umbrella at the same time. The welders in this company are issued high-top leather shoes, then high-top rubber shoes, and then Hercules sneakers. For facial protection, they have protective masks, not counting crystal plano glasses, and also given tinted glasses. Equipping a welder costs 52 yuan!

Poem:

	Rain drizzles along the Xiang River, wearing a raincoat while holding an umbrella,
	Wearing rain boots and holding rain shoes, walking back and forth in the rain with a smile.

Same driver, why such a difference?

The drivers of the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation's Automobile Transportation Company can receive one set of canvas work clothes, one set of twill work clothes, one cotton vest, twenty-four pairs of white thread gloves, twenty-four masks, as well as soap, towels, and kettles each year. The total value of all equipment per person is 75 yuan. The Qingshan Station of the Wuhan Automobile Transportation Company also undertakes the transportation tasks of the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, and the work location is the same, but the labor protection products issued to each driver are only worth 20 yuan per year. In comparison, the difference is two and a half times. The money we spend on equipping one driver can equip three and a half drivers!

Eighteen to one

The depreciation of houses alone in the Qingshan Workers' Village dormitory of the First Engineering Company of Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation costs 0.16 yuan per square meter, but only 0.05 yuan per square meter is charged to employees for rent. The depreciation of the Jiangjiadun bungalows is 0.39 yuan per square meter, and the rent is only 0.045 yuan. The actual water bill is 0.7 yuan per month, but only 0.1 yuan is charged. In the second half of 1957, this company spent more than 260,000 yuan on rent and utilities, but only recovered 13,500 yuan from employees, with the public paying 250,000 yuan. The ratio of public to personal burden is eighteen to one.

In 1957, the Fourth Engineering Company directly under the ministry collected a total of 9,000 yuan in rent from employees, while the repair costs for the same year alone amounted to 23,000 yuan. The total rental income was less than four-tenths of the repair costs. From 1954 to 1957, the subsidies for rent and utilities paid by this company amounted to 325,000 yuan!

The harm of bureaucracy

The reason why the principle of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift cannot be implemented in many of our construction enterprises is that some leading cadres have forgotten the hard and simple style and have gradually become infected with the bourgeois idea of seeking pleasure. They believe that waste in this regard is "a few minor things" and do not pay attention to it. The behavior of young masters and young gentlemen is not despised in enterprises. It is these ideas that have caused hundreds of millions of yuan in waste and eroded our revolutionary fighting spirit!

Compare: Administrative expenses (including wages, office expenses, travel expenses, etc.) per management personnel per year: Nantong City Construction Company (1957): 887 yuan; Ministry average: 1254 yuan; Among them, Eighth Metallurgical Construction Corporation: 1728 yuan.

Specific example: The Director of Supply Ascends to Heaven

The Director of Supply of the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation, as the leader of the supply department, does not know the situation of the company's inventory of materials. At the end of 1957, when preparing materials for the first quarter of 1958, he shouted that there was a shortage of cement and personally flew to Beijing to ask for materials. In fact, the company's warehouse and cement in transit totaled 46,000 tons. After ensuring the needs of the project, more than 10,000 tons can be transferred out. To put it another way, even if there is not enough cement, it is very convenient to take the train from Wuchang to Beijing, so why does the Director of Supply have to fly to heaven!

Difficult to move an inch

In the second half of last year, the manager, deputy manager, and party secretary of the Fourth Company directly under the ministry had three cars, one sedan and two jeeps, one special car for each person. These leading cadres take cars whether they go to the ministry for meetings or go to the construction site to understand the situation. Last year, the total cost of cars was 11,610 yuan. This money is equivalent to twice the total annual salary of two managers and one secretary. With this money, you can buy more than 100,000 kilograms of grain, which can feed more than 270 people for a year. So extravagant, no wonder they lost 960,000 yuan after completing 4 million yuan of tasks.

Pick and choose at will

The production enterprise company affiliated to the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation lost a total of 4,340 pieces of furniture and supplies in the year and a half from March 1956 to the end of 1957. Originally, there were no procedures for receiving furniture and supplies in this company, but the warehouse was opened for people to pick and choose at will.

What's even more wonderful is that the earthwork company affiliated to this corporation did not realize that the warehouse had been stolen several times. It was not until the police caught the thief and asked the earthwork company to send someone to the court that the people from this company said: "We didn't lose anything!"

Leadership responsibility

The waste phenomenon in overhead expenditure cannot be eliminated for a long time, which is related to the lack of a "saving" concept in the leadership of the Construction Bureau and the neglect of political and ideological work. For example, the leadership has seen the atmosphere of extravagance and ostentation in various units, but they seem to see it and not see it, and even when some comrades reflect some wasteful phenomena to the leadership, the leadership often takes an indifferent attitude. For example, when several professional corporations were established in 1955, many of the things purchased in the start-up expenses were wasteful, but when the financial staff reported to the director, the director gave an inexplicable answer: "The general manager of the corporation should be treated according to the standard of the bureau director in terms of living and the standard of the section chief in terms of political treatment," and the matter was dealt with in a vague way.

To establish a style of diligence and thrift, the leadership must vigorously advocate it, and the leadership should give serious treatment to all wasteful phenomena. The leadership of the bureau should pay attention to correcting this shortcoming.

Strive to save 400 million yuan!

During the Second Five-Year Plan, we believe that the overhead expenses of our ministry's construction enterprises can be reduced to 10.25% of the workload, saving 400 million yuan for the country.

The main measures are:

1. Simplify management personnel by about 50%, which can save 241 million yuan in wages and management fees.

2. Mobilize employees to have great debates on unreasonable welfare expenses. If welfare expenses are reduced by 50%, 78 million yuan can be saved.

3. Reduce expenditures on labor protection products that are not related to safety, which can save 22.2 million yuan.

4. Double labor productivity. During the Second Five-Year Plan, completing the same workload as the First Five-Year Plan can reduce the number of workers by 35%. The above-mentioned expenses related to this number of people can be reduced by 67 million yuan.

Only the above four items can save 400 million yuan. (Attached picture)

    学南通  赶南通  超过南通
    ——冶金工业部建筑司财务处的大字报展览会摘要
    浪费了一亿七千万元！
    在第一个五年计划期间，我部建筑企业的间接费用定额（即管理费用和为工程服务的费用）为工作量（即建筑安装总投资）的14.7％，而实际开支却达到了17.05％，浪费了五千一百万元。如果和南通市建筑公司的间接费实际开支相比，我们第一个五年计划期间就浪费了一亿七千万元。请看何等惊人！比一比：每万元工作量支出的间接费用南通市建筑公司（1957年）947元本部平均（1957年）1753元浪费的原因何在？请看下文：人多成灾
    我部各建筑安装企业固定生产工人与非生产人员的比例是二比一，1957年非生产人员达六万八千三百一十四人，同湖南省建设公司1956年生产工人与非生产人员六比一的水平相比，多了四万五千人，全年多支出四千七百二十五万元。如果让这些人都到工地去参加施工，每年还可以多完成二亿五千多万元的工作量。比一比：管理人员占建筑安装工人的比例湖南省建设公司（1956年）14％本部平均（1957年）30％其中鞍山冶金建筑总公司（1957年）38.5％具体事例：九个人侍候一辆车
    武汉冶金建筑总公司运输公司1957年共有二百四十四辆汽车，为这些车服务的有六百三十六名司机，三百一十四个管理人员，外加二百多个装卸工人。虽然为这些汽车服务的人不少，但60％的汽车经常处于损坏、停修状态，平时出车的只有九十七辆。按经常出车的车数计算，每辆车平均就有六个司机，三个管理人员。九个人管一辆车，抬起来走都行了！福利无边
    在间接费的实际支出中，福利费占28％左右。初步计算，第一个五年计划中至少有一半以上是属于浪费的。
            比一比：每人每年福利事业补助费湖南省建设公司（1956年）36.2元我部平均（1957年）78.2元其中安装总公司（1957年）104.1元具体事例：病人不多　大夫不少
    直属第四工程公司苹果园医务所每天不过六七十人看病，但却有五个医生、六个护士、两个药剂师、三个管理员和两个勤杂人员。此外还有一辆救护车和一名司机。这个公司从1956年起还擅自修改劳保条例，把家属医药费报销50％的规定修改为报销80％，大大鼓励了职工家属看病的“积极性”。1957年这个公司总共才完成了四百多万元的工作量，但只医药费就花了十六万二千元！身穿雨衣打雨伞
    第九冶金建筑总公司所属的第二安装公司共有六百工人，却有四百零六件雨衣，五百二十六把雨伞。绝大部分工人可以同时领到一件雨衣和一把雨伞。这个公司的电焊工，发了高统皮鞋，又给高统胶鞋，再给力士球鞋。为了防护面部，有了防护面罩，水晶平光镜不算，还给有色眼镜。装备一个电焊工就要花五十二元！
    诗曰：
    湘江两岸雨绵绵，身穿雨衣打雨伞，
    足登雨鞋拿雨靴，往来雨中带笑颜。同样是司机　相差何悬殊
    武汉冶金建筑总公司汽车运输公司的司机，每人每年能领帆布工作服一套，斜纹布工作服一套，棉坎肩一件，白线手套二十四付，口罩二十四个，还有肥皂、毛巾、水壶等。每人配备的全部价值为七十五元。而武汉市汽车运输公司青山站同样负担武汉冶金建筑总公司的运输任务，工作地点都一样，但他们发给每个司机的劳动保护品每年仅值二十元。比较起来，相差二倍半，我们装备一个司机所花的钱，人家就能装备三个半司机！十八比一
    武汉冶金建筑总公司第一工程公司青山工人村宿舍，仅房屋折旧一项，每平方公尺要花一角六分，但每平方公尺只向职工收五分钱的房租。蒋家墩平房每平方公尺折旧三角九分，房租只收四分五。水费每月实花七角只收一角。这个公司1957年下半年房租水电花了二十六万余元，只向职工收回了一万三千五百元，公家赔了二十五万元。公家与个人负担的比例是十八比一。
    直属第四工程公司在1957年共向职工收入房租九千元，而同年单是房屋修理费一项就花了二万三千元，全部房租收入还不到修理费的十分之四。这个公司从1954年到1957年支出的房租水电补贴费竟达三十二万五千元！官气之害
    在我们的许多建筑企业里，不能贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，是由于一些领导干部把艰苦朴素忘到了脑后，而逐渐沾染了资产阶级贪图享受的思想，他们认为这方面的浪费是“些、点小事”，不放在眼里。大少爷、大相公的行为，在企业里遭不到鄙视。正是这些思想造成了上亿元的浪费，腐蚀了我们的革命斗志！比一比：每个管理人员每年支出的行政管理费用（包括工资、办公费、出差旅费等）南通市建筑公司（1957年）887元我部平均1254元其中第八冶金建筑总公司1728元具体事例：供应处长上天
    武汉冶金建筑总公司的供应处长，身为供应部门的领导者，竟不知道公司库存材料的情况。1957年末，在准备1958年第一季工程用的材料时，他大叫水泥不足，并亲自坐飞机赶到北京来要料。实际上这个公司的仓库里和在运输途中的水泥，共有四万六千吨。保证工程需用后，还可以调出一万多吨。退一步说，就是水泥不够，从武昌到北京坐火车也很方便，又何必供应处长飞上天呢！寸步难行
    去年下半年，直属第四公司的经理、副经理和党委书记三个人，有轿车、吉普车三辆，每人有一辆专车。这些领导干部不论到部里开会或是下工地了解情况，都是坐小汽车。去年一年共花了汽车费一万一千六百一十元。这笔钱相当于两个经理一个书记全年工资总额的两倍。用这些钱可以买十万多斤粮食，可以供二百七十多人吃一年。这样阔气，无怪乎他们干了四百万元的任务，就亏本九十六万元。任　凭　挑　选
    武汉冶金建筑总公司所属的生产企业公司，从1956年3月到1957年底，这一年多时间里，共丢失了大小家俱和用品四千三百四十件。原来这个公司领用家俱用品根本没有手续，而是打开仓库任凭挑选。
    更妙的是这个总公司所属的土方公司，仓库几次被人偷盗，一直没有发觉。直到派出所抓住了小偷，叫土方公司派人去法院时，这个公司的人还说：“我们没丢东西呀！”（陈奇峰插图）领导的责任
    间接费用开支上的浪费现象长期不能杜绝，和建筑司的领导上“省”的观念不足，以及忽视政治思想工作，是有关的。如各单位讲阔气、讲排场之风，领导上虽有所见，但却似见不见，甚至当有些同志发现了一些浪费现象向领导上反映时，领导上也往往采取不以为然的态度。如1955年成立几个专业总公司时，开办费中购置的东西很多都是浪费的，但当财务人员向司长报告后，司长却以“总公司经理生活待遇上按司局长的标准，政治待遇上按处长的标准”的令人不解的回答，不了了之地处理了这个问题。
    树立勤俭之风，必须领导上大力提倡，对一切浪费现象，领导上都应该给以严肃的处理。司的领导上应该注意纠正这方面的缺点。争取节约四亿元！
    第二个五年计划期间，我部建筑企业的间接费用，我们认为可以降到占工作量的10.25％，为国家节约四亿元。
    主要措施是：
    一、精简管理人员50％左右，可以节约工资和管理费二亿四千一百万元。
    二、发动职工对不合理的福利费用进行大争大辩，如果福利费用减去50％，就可以节约七千八百万元。
    三、削减劳动保护品中与安全无关的开支，可以节约二千二百万元。
    四、把劳动生产率提高一倍，在第二个五年计划期间完成和第一个五年计划同样的工作量，就可以少用35％的工人。和这个人数有关的上述费用，就可以减少六千七百万元。
    仅上述四笔，就可以节约四亿元。（附图片）
