    Another Creation: Extracting Fertilizer from Smoke

    (Report from our newspaper) The Xie Village First Cooperative in Zhongcun Township, Panyu County, Guangdong, is building 230 smoke-nitrogen-extracting kilns, known as "Farmhouse Fertilizer Factories." It is expected that each household in the cooperative will build one this year.

    The kiln-style "extracting fertilizer from smoke" was created by cadres of the county's Commercial Bureau. It utilizes mud bricks to build a frame-shaped, multi-curved, slender, multi-layered smoke flue to absorb nitrogen from the smoke. After six months, the mud bricks that make up the kiln become excellent fertilizer. Such a kiln can extract more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer per year, enough to fertilize three mu of land. The Panyu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party calculated that if every household in the county builds a smoke kiln, the fertilizer accumulated in a year could solve the fertilizer needs of one-third of the county's cultivated land.

    烟中取肥又一创造
    本报讯　广东番禺县钟村乡谢村一社正在兴建二百三十个号称“农家制肥厂”的烟中取氮烟框，预计该社在今年内每户都要建一个。
    烟框式的“烟中取肥”是由该县商业局的干部创造的。它是利用泥砖砌成一个框形多弯细长的多层烟窗，吸取烟中氮气，经过六个月以后，砌烟框的泥砖便成了很好的肥料。这样的烟框一年可取到一万多斤肥料，能解决三亩地的用肥。中共番禺县县委会曾算了一笔账：如果全县每户建立一个烟框，一年所积的肥料可以解决全县三分之一耕地的用肥。
