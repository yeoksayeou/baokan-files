Dear Comrades and Friends:

    After spending ten days in your country, the moment of parting has arrived.
    We have been deeply moved by the warm friendship we have encountered everywhere in your homeland.
    The meetings with the Chinese working people and the visits to some of your major factories have left us with unforgettable impressions. All of this has enabled us to better understand and more admire the Chinese people's fervent patriotism, their profound loyalty to the people's democratic system, and the enthusiasm and confidence they have demonstrated under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party in their tireless labor to build their new, socialist life.
    We were very pleased to visit Shenyang, an important center of the steel industry, and Anshan, the "Steel Capital," where the factories are a vivid expression of the great creative abilities of the working class, technicians, and engineers of New China.
    Dear comrades, we wish you, the working people of Shenyang and Liaoning Province, and all the working people of People's China, new and glorious achievements in your tireless labor to prosper and flourish your motherland, to continue to strengthen the socialist camp, and to defend world peace.
    Dear comrades, goodbye.

    基伏·斯托伊卡主席的告别辞亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    在你们国家度过了十天以后，分别的时刻来到了。
    在你们祖国辽阔的土地上到处所遇到的热烈的友情深深地感动了我们。
    与中国劳动人民的会见以及到你们一些大工厂的参观，给我们留下不可磨灭的印象。所有这一切，使我们能更好地了解和更多地钦佩中国人民热烈的爱国主义，他们对人民民主制度深厚的忠诚，他们在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在为建设自己新的、社会主义的生活而不倦地劳动中所表现的热情和信心。
    我们访问了重要的钢铁工业中心——沈阳和钢都——鞍山，使我们很满意，这些城市中的工厂是新中国的工人阶级、技术、工程师的巨大创造能力的生动表现。
    亲爱的同志们，祝你们，沈阳市和辽宁省的劳动人民，以及人民中国的所有劳动人民在为你们祖国的繁荣和兴盛，为继续加强社会主义阵营和保卫世界和平而不倦的劳动中获得新的光辉的成就。
    亲爱的同志们，再见。
