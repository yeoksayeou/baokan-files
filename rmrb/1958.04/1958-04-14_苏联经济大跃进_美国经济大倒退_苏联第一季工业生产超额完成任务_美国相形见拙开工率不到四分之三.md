Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th -- Just as the American economic crisis is continuously worsening, Soviet industrial production has achieved great success in the first quarter of this year. According to materials published by the Soviet Central Statistical Bureau, the Soviet Union completed 104% of its industrial gross output plan for the first quarter of this year. Industrial production increased by 11% compared with the same period last year. Industrial labor productivity increased by 7% compared with the same period last year. All national economic committees have completed and exceeded their tasks.

In sharp contrast: the entire American industrial production is continuing to decline. The production index for the last week of March was two points lower than the average index for February, and about 13% lower than the peak production in December 1956. Currently, the operating rate of the entire American industry cannot reach three-quarters of its production capacity.

In the first quarter of this year, the Soviet Union produced 13.3 million tons of steel, an increase of 7% compared with the same period last year. However, the operating rate of the American steel industry has been declining. In the week from the end of March to the beginning of April, steel production fell to its lowest level in almost eleven years, and the operating rate of the steel industry was only 48.6%. Last week, American steel production was 1,300,600 tons, while it was 2,310,000 tons in the same period last year.

In the first quarter of this year, the Soviet Union produced 122 million tons of coal, an increase of about 20 million tons compared with the same period last year, while the United States mined less than 91 million tons of coal from January 1 to March 22.

In the first quarter of this year, the Soviet Union also produced 9.5 million tons of pig iron, 21.1 million tons of iron ore, 26.3 million tons of petroleum, and 51 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. The production plans for other heavy industrial products and important daily necessities have also been overfulfilled.

The Sixth Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union stipulates that by 1960, steel production will reach 68.3 million tons, 151% of that in 1955. Pig iron production will reach 53 million tons, 159% of that in 1955. This is the No. 4 blast furnace of the Voroshilov Steel Plant in the Voroshilovgrad Oblast, which can produce 1,700 tons of pig iron per day.

    苏联经济大跃进　美国经济大倒退
    苏联第一季工业生产超额完成任务
    美国相形见拙开工率不到四分之三
    新华社莫斯科13日电　正当美国经济危机不断加重的时候，苏联工业生产在今年第一季度又取得了巨大的成就。根据苏联中央统计局发表的材料，苏联今年第一季度的工业总产值计划完成了104％。工业生产量比去年同期增长了11％。工业劳动生产率比去年同期提高了7％。各个国民经济委员会都完成和超额完成了任务。
    与此成为鲜明对照的是：美国整个工业生产正在继续下降。3月份最后一个星期的生产指数比2月份的平均指数又降低了两点，比1956年12月的生产最高峰降低约13％。现在，美国整个工业的开工率达不到它的生产能力的四分之三。
    今年第一季度，苏联生产了一千三百三十万吨钢，比去年同期增加了7％。而美国炼钢业的开工率一直在下降，在3月末到4月初的一个星期里，钢产量跌落到差不多十一年来的最低水平，炼钢业的开工率只有48.6％。上星期美国钢产量是一百三十万零六千吨，而去年同期是二百三十一万吨。
    今年第一季，苏联生产了一亿二千二百万吨煤，比去年同期增加了约二千万吨，而美国从1月1日到3月22日开采的煤还不到九千一百万吨。
    苏联在今年第一季度还生产了九百五十万吨生铁、二千一百一十万吨铁矿砂、二千六百三十万吨石油、五百一十亿度电力。其他重工业品和重要日用品的生产计划也都超额完成了。

    苏联第六个五年计划规定，到1960年钢的生产将达到六千八百三十万吨，为1955年的151％。铣铁的生产将达到五千三百万吨，为1955年的159％。这是伏罗希洛夫格勒州伏罗希洛夫钢铁厂的第四号炼铁炉，每日能生产一千七百吨生铁。
