Can a System Never Be Changed?
    The Jingying Zhongheng Street Branch of the Taiyuan North City Grain Main Store Should Be Inspected

    Because I didn't have much money on hand, I only bought twelve catties of grain a few days ago. Today (April 2nd) it was all eaten, so I went to the Jingying Zhongheng Street Branch of the Taiyuan North City Grain Main Store again to buy some, and ended up with a bellyful of anger. The grain sales clerk looked through my grain purchase booklet, and then threw the booklet out, saying, "You can't buy grain twice in ten days." I negotiated with him, asking for consideration, but before I could finish speaking, he said righteously, "No, it's the rule! You can't buy twice in ten days." It seemed there was no room for discussion. I had to step aside and let those who came later buy first. After everyone else had bought, I went to the sales window again and pleaded with the clerk, "Please let me buy some! I didn't intentionally violate the rule, it's just that I didn't have enough money to buy more grain a few days ago." He still insisted on not selling to me. I then said, "Can't you change this rule?" He replied very bluntly, "A rule that's been set can't be changed." At this point, I thought about my child at home who needed to be fed, and that I should start cooking, so I became anxious and started to cry. The clerk, seeing me cry, ignored me even more, nonchalantly scribbling on a piece of scrap paper. Finally, he glanced at me contemptuously a few times and gave me the grain coupons. However, he warned me, "I'm letting you buy this time, but you can't do this again next time."

    I read in the newspaper that after the Double-Anti Movement, many inconvenient-to-consumers rules in commercial departments and service units were changed. For example, in the past, you couldn't buy just one needle, you had to buy a whole package, but now you can buy just one; in the past, you couldn't buy less than a foot of woolen fabric, but now you can buy just an inch. Moreover, many salespersons even deliver goods to your door, and grain store employees carry grain to your home... But I wonder why the "can't buy grain twice in ten days" rule at the Jingying Zhongheng Street Branch of the Taiyuan North City Grain Main Store cannot be changed?

    制度永远不能改吗？
    太原北城粮食总店精营中横街门市部应检查
    我因为手头钱不多，前几天只买了十二斤粮食，今天（4月2日）已吃完了，我又到太原市北城粮食总店精营中横街门市部去买，结果蹩了一肚子气。售粮开票员翻看了我的购粮本后，“刷”的一下就把本子扔了出来说：“十天不能买两次粮食”。我和他商量，请求照顾，话还没有说完，他又理直气壮地说：“不行，这是制度！十天不能买两次。”看来毫无商量余地。我只好退在一旁，让后来的先买。等大伙买完，我又到售粮窗口向开票员恳求：“让我买上吧！我不是故意违反制度，因为前几天没有钱多买粮食。”他还是坚持不卖给我。我又说：“你们这个制度不能改一改吗？”他回答得很干脆：“定下的制度就不能改。”这时我想到家里的孩子已到吃奶的时候了，我也该动手做饭了，就急得哭起来。开票员见我哭了，更不理睬我，若无其事地拿着笔在一块废纸上乱画起来。最后，才轻蔑地看了我几眼，给我开了粮票。不过他警告我说：“这一次让你买了，下一次再不能这样。”
    我看到报上常说，经过双反运动之后，商业部门和服务单位许多不便利消费者的制度都改掉了。譬如过去买针非一包不卖，现在买一根也行；过去买呢绒非一尺不卖，现在一寸也卖。而且更有不少售货员送货上门，粮店的职工背粮到家……。可是我们太原市北城粮食总店精营中横街门市部的“十天不能买两次粮”的制度不知为什么就不能改变？
