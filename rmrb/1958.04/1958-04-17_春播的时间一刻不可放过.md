    Spring planting is in full swing across the country from south to north, now that Qingming has passed. Completing the spring planting plan on time and ensuring full and robust seedlings is the foundation for achieving a great leap forward in agricultural production this year, and it is currently the most important and urgent central task in rural areas. Therefore, at this moment, every second of spring planting time is worth its weight in gold and must not be wasted.
    This year's spring planting preparations in various regions are much better than in any previous year. The broad masses of farmers and rural cadres, after the all-people rectification and socialist education movement, have an unprecedentedly high revolutionary drive. More than 300 million mu of dry land nationwide have been transformed into paddy fields or irrigated land; more than 70 million mu of barren land have been turned into fertile land; an average of more than 13,000 jin of fertilizer has been applied per mu of cultivated land; seeds are basically sufficient; and production tools have been generally repaired and improved. These are all good conditions for spring planting this year.
    To do a good job in this year's spring planting, various regions must also pay attention to some issues.
    One important issue is how to thoroughly overcome drought and ensure timely sowing. All regions must quickly mobilize the masses to conduct a general survey of soil moisture, classify and rank the land, and take corresponding drought resistance and prevention measures according to different situations. Where soil moisture is good, we must immediately seize the time to plant while the soil is moist. Where soil moisture is poor, we must quickly irrigate or use point-sowing with water to ensure that seeds are sown well even without rain. In some areas, many water conservancy projects have been built, but water cannot reach the fields due to the lack of water lifting equipment, poorly constructed canals, and uneven land. Therefore, while completing the final stages of water conservancy projects, all regions must quickly install water lifting equipment, dig canals, and level land to give full play to the benefits of water conservancy projects. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the inspection and acceptance of water conservancy projects to ensure project quality and prevent floods during the flood season.
    In the high tide of the production leap forward, various regions have repeatedly revised production targets and measures. The revised advanced targets have greatly boosted the morale of the masses. However, in some areas, the county's plan has been revised repeatedly, and the township and commune plans have followed suit, constantly changing. Until now, some communes have not yet finalized their production plans, so the contracting system and production quotas have not been worked out, and they are still unsure how much seeds, pesticides, and other production materials need to be prepared, which has affected the progress and quality of spring planting. This is also a major problem. All regions must step up efforts to help agricultural cooperatives immediately determine their production plans, implement the "three guarantees" down to the team level, and quickly carry out spring planting.
    With advanced planning targets, there must be concrete measures to guarantee them. Some communes have mobilized the masses to debate, offer suggestions, and fully tap the potential for increased production, so that measures take root. Other communes have adopted the method of "targets to the team, measures to the field, responsibility to the person," so that various measures are implemented in a solid and comprehensive manner. This is the situation in most agricultural cooperatives. However, there are also some communes where measures do not keep up with the targets, or even if there are measures, their implementation is slack and weak. All communes with this situation should strive to catch up, firmly grasp the farming season, take up various measures, and earnestly and comprehensively implement them in every production link. We should regularly check the implementation of increased production measures, pay attention to tapping new potential for increased production, and supplement new increased production measures.
    Expanding the planting of high-yield crops is a key measure for many regions to strive to achieve the "four, five, eight" targets this year. According to incomplete statistics, provinces nationwide plan to expand the planting of rice by more than 110 million mu, potatoes by more than 50 million mu, and corn by more than 20 million mu this year. This plan must be guaranteed to be realized. Some regions still lack potato seedlings and rice seeds, and they should quickly seize the time to solve this problem. According to the experience of Hebei Province, as long as we rely on the masses, "extend our hands downwards," and supplement with necessary adjustments, the seed problem can be completely solved. Improving seedling raising methods and increasing seedling emergence rates are the most effective ways to solve the current shortage of potato seedlings. Qidong County in Shandong Province originally lacked 1.93 million jin of potato seedlings. After adopting the "three-level seedling raising method" from Ningjin County, Hebei Province, not only were there enough seedlings, but there was even a surplus, and 100,000 jin have now been transferred to Boxing County. Various regions have also created many good methods for the transfer of technology in newly converted rice growing areas. For example, Henan and Shandong provinces have hired experienced veteran farmers from other places to teach technology in the new areas, and at the same time, they have sent key personnel from the new areas to the old areas to learn technology, which has had a very good effect and can be widely adopted by various regions.
    While vigorously developing high-yield crops, we must also pay attention to the rational arrangement of other grain crops, oil crops, as well as cash crops such as cotton, flue-cured tobacco, hemp, sugarcane, and sugar beets, to prevent focusing on one thing and losing sight of the others, and strive for an all-round leap forward.
    Strengthening the cultivation and management of summer harvested crops such as wheat and rapeseed, and striving for a bumper summer harvest is also an important task at present. The national summer harvested grain crop area is equivalent to about one-quarter of the total annual grain crop area, and the rapeseed planting area accounts for about one-third of the entire oil crop area. The success or failure of the summer harvest has a great impact on whether agricultural production can achieve a great leap forward throughout the year. There are still one and a half to two months before the summer harvest, so we must continue to work hard, strengthen cultivation and management, resolutely eliminate the three types of weak seedlings, and do a good job in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests and preventing frost.
    Various undertakings in the countryside are now leaping forward, and many regions have already felt a shortage of labor. Therefore, all regions and agricultural cooperatives should formulate labor plans, rationally arrange various tasks, and give full play to the potential of all kinds of labor, male, female, old, and young. At the same time, they should vigorously carry out agricultural tool improvements and promote new agricultural tools to improve labor efficiency. In areas where the masses have difficulties in life and production due to last year's disaster, necessary support should be provided, and all means should be used to ensure the timely completion of spring planting. Of course, the most important and urgent task in rural areas at present is timely spring planting to ensure full and robust seedlings. All other tasks should be centered on spring planting, distinguishing between the important, the less important and the urgent, and arranging them properly.

### 春播的时间一刻不可放过

    春播的时间一刻不可放过
    清明已过，全国从南到北普遍掀起了春季播种的高潮。适时完成春播计划，保证苗全苗壮，是实现今年农业生产大跃进的基础，是当前农村中最重要最紧急的中心任务。因此，目前春播的时间，真是一刻千金，万万不可放过。
    今年各地的春播准备工作，比以往任何一年都好得多。广大农民群众和农村干部经过全民整风和社会主义教育运动，革命干劲空前高涨；全国有三亿多亩旱地变成了水田或水浇地；七千多万亩瘠薄的土地变成了良田；平均每亩耕地已有一万三千多斤肥料；种子已经基本够用；生产工具普遍进行了修补和改良，这些都是今年春播的好条件。
    现在为了做好今年的春播工作，各地还必须注意一些问题。
    一个重要的问题是如何彻底地战胜干旱，保证适时播种。各地必须赶快发动群众，普遍查验墒情，分类排队，根据不同情况，采取相应抗旱和防旱措施。墒情较好的，要立即趁墒抢种；墒情不好的，抓紧灌溉或挑水点种，保证没雨也要播好种。有些地区已经修建了许多水利工程，但由于没有提水工具，渠道没有搞好，土地还不平整等，水流不到地里。因此，各地在水利工程扫尾的同时，必须抓紧安装提水工具，修挖渠道，平整土地，以充分发挥水利工程的效益。同时也要加强水利工程的检查验收工作，确保工程质量，防止到汛期发生水患。
    在生产跃进的高潮中，各地都再三修订了生产指标和措施指标。修订后的先进指标大大鼓舞了群众的干劲。但是有些地区由于县的计划再三修改，乡和社的计划跟着不断地变，直到现在有些社的生产计划还没有最后确定，以致包工包产方案还没有搞好，需要准备多少种子、农药等生产资料，也还心中没数，从而影响了春播的进度和质量。这也是一个大问题。各地必须加紧帮助农业社马上确定生产计划，使“三包”贯彻到队，赶快进行春播。
    有了先进的计划指标，必须有具体的措施做保证。有的社发动群众辩论，献策献计，充分挖掘增产潜力，使措施扎下根；有的社采取“指标到队、措施到田、责任到人”的办法，使各项措施扎扎实实地贯彻下去，这是多数农业社的情况。但也还有些社措施跟不上指标，或者有了措施，在贯彻执行上却松懈无力。凡是存有这种情况的社，都应当奋起直追，紧紧掌握住农时，把各项措施抓起来，认真地全面地贯彻到每一个生产环节中去。应当经常检查增产措施的执行情况，注意挖掘新的增产潜力，补充新的增产措施。
    扩种高产作物是许多地区争取今年实现“四、五、八”指标的关键性措施。据不完全统计，今年全国各省计划扩种水稻一亿一千多万亩，薯类五千多万亩，玉米两千多万亩。这个计划必须保证实现。现在还有些地区缺乏薯种和稻种，应当赶快抓紧解决。根据河北省的经验，只要依靠群众，“手向下伸”，辅之以必要的调剂，种子问题是完全可以解决的。改进育秧方法，提高出秧率，是当前解决薯种不足问题最有效的方法。山东省齐东县本来缺薯秧一百九十三万斤。采用了河北省宁津县的“三级育苗法”以后，秧不仅够用，而且有余，现在已经调剂给博兴县十万多斤。新改种水稻地区的技术传授问题，各地也创造了许多好办法。例如河南和山东等省都从外地聘请有经验的老农到新区传授技术，同时从新区派出骨干到老区学习技术，效果很好，各地可以普遍采用。
    在大力发展高产作物的同时，对于其他粮食作物、油料作物、以及棉花、烤烟、麻、甘蔗、甜菜等经济作物，也要注意合理安排，防止顾此失彼，力争全面跃进。
    加强小麦和油菜等夏收作物的培育管理，争取夏季丰收，也是当前的一项重要工作。全国夏收的粮食作物面积相当于全年粮食作物总面积的四分之一左右，油菜的种植面积占整个油料作物面积的三分之一左右。夏收的丰歉，对于全年农业生产能否大跃进有极大的影响。现在距离夏收还有一个半月到两个月，必须再接再厉，加强培育管理，坚决消灭三类苗，并做好防治病虫害和预防霜冻的工作。
    现在农村中各项事业都在跃进，许多地区都已经感到劳动力不足。因此，各个地区和各个农业社都应当制订劳动力规划，合理安排各项工作，充分发挥男女老弱各种劳动力的潜力；同时应当大搞农具改良，推广新式农具，以便提高劳动效率。去年受灾，群众在生活和生产上有困难的地方，要给以必要的支援，用一切办法保证适时完成春播。当然，目前农村中最重要最紧急的任务是适时春播，保证苗全苗壮。其他工作都应当以春播为中心，分清轻重缓急，妥善安排。
