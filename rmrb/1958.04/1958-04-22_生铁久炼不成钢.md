　　Pig Iron Can't Be Refined Into Steel No Matter How Long You Refine It
　　Mi Yang
　　As the saying goes, "Pig iron can be refined into steel after a long time," but in fact, pig iron refined for too long is not steel but wrought iron. Wrought iron, pig iron, and steel are all alloys of iron and carbon, but they are different.
　　The iron ore mined from the mountains is a compound called iron oxide. This compound is mixed with coke in a certain proportion and heated to 1200-1300 degrees Celsius in a blast furnace, after which the iron is reduced. This is the pig iron usually used to cast pots and make plows.
　　The pig iron is melted in a converter, and air is blown in from the bottom of the furnace. The oxygen in the air combines with the carbon in the molten iron to form carbon dioxide gas, which escapes. Observe the degree to which the carbon is burned off, and when the heat is right, steel is made.
　　Pig iron is extremely brittle, wrought iron is too soft, and steel is hard and tough. This is related to the amount of carbon they contain. The carbon content of steel is between 0.008% and 1.7%. It is a mixture of extremely fine grains of pure iron and iron carbide. The particles are so small that sometimes they cannot be seen even with a microscope, and their shape can only be seen with an electron microscope. If the carbon content is higher than 1.7%, many larger pieces of brittle iron carbide will start to be mixed on the surface of the steel, and the strength will be greatly reduced. This is pig iron. The more carbon it contains, the more brittle the pig iron becomes.
　　Steel has a very strange property, that is, the hardness difference is very large between rapid cooling after being burned red (for example, immediately throwing it into cold water) and slow cooling. Rapid cooling is called quenching. Quenched steel is particularly hard, and ordinary knives and scissors are quenched.
　　If some other metals are added to steel, alloy steels with various special properties can often be obtained. For example, when manufacturing springs, steel with extremely strong elasticity is needed, some silicon and manganese need to be added. Ordinary stainless steel contains a large amount of chromium and nickel.
　　China's iron ore reserves are extremely rich. The proven reserves by the end of 1957 had reached 4.7 billion tons, second only to the Soviet Union and India, ranking third in the world. With the deepening of exploration, more deposits will be discovered.

    生铁久炼不成钢

    俗话说：“生铁久炼便成钢”，其实生铁炼得过久不是钢而是熟铁。熟铁、生铁和钢都是铁和碳的合金，但是它们之间又有所区别。
    从矿山上开采出来的铁矿是一种叫氧化铁的化合物。这种化合物和焦炭按一定比例混匀，放到鼓风炉（俗称高炉）中加热到一千二、三百度后，铁就被还原出来了。这就是通常用来铸锅做犁的生铁。
    把生铁放在转炉中熔化，从炉底吹进空气，空气中的氧和铁水中的碳化合成二氧化碳气跑掉了。观察碳被烧去的程度，火候到了，钢就炼成了。
    生铁极脆，熟铁太软，钢则坚硬而有韧性。这与它们含碳的多少有关。钢的含碳量介于0.008％到1.7％之间，它是由极细粒的纯铁和碳化铁混匀的一种东西。颗粒极小，小到有时用显微镜都看不见，只有用电子显微镜才能看清它们的形状。如果含碳量高过了1.7％，这时在钢表面就要开始夹杂许多较大块的、性质较脆的碳化铁，强度就会大大减低，这就是生铁。含碳愈多，生铁的性质也愈脆。
    钢有一种非常奇怪的性质，那就是烧红以后迅速冷却（例如马上丢到冷水中）和慢慢冷下来，硬度差别很大。速冷称为淬火。淬火后的钢特别硬，通常的刀剪工具都是淬过火的。
    钢中要是再加些别的金属，常常能够得到各种特殊性能的合金钢。例如制造弹簧时需要弹性特强的钢时，需要加进一些硅和锰。普通的不锈钢则含有大量的铬和镍。
    我国铁矿的蕴藏量极为丰富，1957年年底以前探明的储量已达四十七亿吨，仅次于苏联、印度而居世界第三位。随着勘探的深入，必将发现更多的矿藏。
