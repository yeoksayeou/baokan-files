Editor's Note:

A Good Transformation

Cadres are the servants of the people; this title is excellent, and it plainly expresses the essence of cadres serving the people. However, some of our cadres are unworthy of this title. Although they have the good intention to serve, they do not achieve good results. Why? It is because they have not become integrated with the masses.

Of course, cadres and the masses are not exactly the same. However, cadres who serve the masses must be integrated with the masses. In this regard, our cadres should play "two roles": both cadres and members of the masses. The masses do not treat cadres as "outsiders" but as members of their own group, willing to discuss matters with them and share their thoughts. Cadres and the masses are truly connected and have a heart-to-heart understanding.

If we cannot achieve this, even if we say we want to "mingle with the masses," the masses will still feel "separate." Even if we say we want to "share the same breath" and "share the same fate" with the masses, the masses will still feel that they cannot "share" or "co-exist."

The cadres of Pingba District, Jinsha County, Guizhou Province, have achieved regular labor, a mass-oriented lifestyle, and localized language, a very good transformation. All cadres who sincerely want to be servants of the masses should integrate themselves with the masses.

    化得好
    干部是群众的勤务员，这个称号极好，它通俗地道出了干部为人民服务的本质。可是，我们有些干部却当之有愧，虽然他们有服务的一片好心，却得不到好的效果。为什么？就是因为他们还没有群众化。
    干部和群众当然不完全一样，但是，为群众服务的干部必须群众化。就这一点说，我们的干部应该是“一身二任”，既是干部，又是群众。群众对干部不是“见外”，而是当作自己中间的一员，有事愿意跟干部商量，有话愿意同干部讲。干部和群众真正是息息相通，心心相印。
    要是作不到这一点，尽管我们口头上说要和群众“打成一片”，群众还是感到“两片”。尽管我们口头上说要和群众“同呼吸”“共命运”，群众还是感到既“同”不起来，也“共”不起来。
  贵州金沙县平坝区干部作到了劳动经常化、生活群众化、语言民族化，化得很好。一切真正愿意当群众勤务员的干部都应该使自己群众化起来。
