    It Must Be Destroyed!
    Poetry by Yuan Shuipai, Painting by Hua Junwu

    Flags fill the city, flying in the wind,
    The people open up battlefields to the sky,
    Every household mobilizes,
    Every courtyard and room sets up sentry posts,
    Beating gongs and drums, firing guns,
    Lost and bewildered sparrows have nowhere to hide!
    The people are united to eliminate the Four Pests,
    We will not allow rats and sparrows to steal our grain!
    The people are united to eliminate the Four Pests,
    We will not allow disease to harm our health!
    Whether it be man, ghost, insect, or bird,
    Anything that harms socialism,
    It must be destroyed!
                      April 19

    一定要它灭亡！
    袁水拍诗　华君武画满城旗帜迎风扬，人民对天辟战场，家家户户齐出动，院院房房布哨岗，敲锣打鼓放火枪，失魂的麻雀无处藏！人民齐心除四害，不许鼠雀抢我粮！人民齐心除四害，不许疫病损健康！管它是人是鬼是虫是鸟，谋害社会主义的，一定要它灭亡！
