Xinhua News Agency, London, April 7th. The British Cooperative Party Annual Meeting held in Hastings on April 5th unanimously passed a resolution condemning the British government's refusal to stop hydrogen bomb testing and calling for an early East-West summit.

The resolution expressed concern about Britain allowing American planes carrying hydrogen bombs to fly over British territory, the decision to establish rocket bases in Britain, and support for arming West Germany with atomic weapons.

The annual meeting of the British Union of Clerical and Administrative Workers also passed a resolution demanding that the government stop hydrogen bomb testing.

Xinhua News Agency, April 7th. According to TASS, London: The Cooperative Party's newspaper, "Reynolds News," commented on April 6th on the Soviet government's statement on halting nuclear weapons testing, saying, "No matter how much Washington complains, it cannot diminish the honor the Soviet Union has gained among millions upon millions of people for making this decision." The newspaper believes that "Britain should now emulate this practice." The newspaper wrote, "We welcome anyone who strives to transform nuclear energy from an instrument of destruction with unlimited power into a tool of hope for humanity. We welcome anyone who strives to have Britain abandon atomic testing and the construction of rocket bases, as this would be the most significant and direct contribution Britain could make to the cause of peace."

An international commentary published in the conservative "Observer" also pointed out that the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally halt nuclear weapons testing was of great significance and would gain the support of all non-aligned countries, who would see the Soviet measures as a sign that the Soviet Union was willing to end the nuclear danger, while the United States was not.

The newspaper acknowledged that in Britain and throughout Europe, there was great dissatisfaction with the continued testing of nuclear weapons.

An editorial in the newspaper called on Western countries to seriously consider the new peace initiatives put forward by the Soviet government, and called on Britain to abandon its planned nuclear weapons test in the summer. It also said that even if the United States insisted on conducting tests, Britain should abandon them.

The "Observer's" Paris correspondent believed that the Soviet government's statement had deepened the divisions and confusion within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    英国合作党年会一致通过决议
    谴责英政府拒绝停止核试验
    英报呼吁西方国家认真对待苏联的新倡议
    新华社伦敦7日电　在哈斯丁斯举行的英国合作党年会会议5日一致通过了一项决议，谴责英国政府拒绝停止试验氢弹，并且要求早日召开东西方最高级会议。
    决议对于英国让载有氢弹的美国飞机在英国上空飞行和决定在英国建立火箭基地以及支持用原子武器武装西德表示感到不安。
    英国文书和行政工作人员工会年会也通过了一项要求政府停止氢弹试验的决议。
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：合作党机关报“雷诺新闻”6日评论苏联政府关于停止核武器试验的声明说，“不管华盛顿怎样埋怨都不能降低苏联由于作出这个决定而在千千万万人中间获得的荣誉”。报纸认为，“英国现在应该仿效这种做法”。报纸写道，“我们欢迎任何人争取把核能从具有无限力量的破坏工具变为使人产生希望的工具。我们欢迎任何人争取使英国放弃原子试验和建筑火箭基地，因为这是英国对保卫和平的事业可能作出的最重大和最直接的贡献。”
    保守的“观察家报”发表的一篇国际评论中也指出，苏联关于单方面停止试验核武器的决定意义重大，并且将获得一切不参加集团的国家的支持，这些国家的人将把苏联的措施看成苏联愿意结束核危险，而美国却不愿意这样做的标志。
    报纸承认：在英国和整个欧洲，人们都对继续试验核武器表示非常不满。
    这家报纸的一篇社论呼吁西方国家认真地对待苏联政府提出的新的和平倡议，并且呼吁英国放弃它原来准备在夏天进行的核武器试验。它还说，即使美国坚持要进行试验，英国也应该放弃。
    “观察家报”驻巴黎记者认为，苏联政府的声明加深了北大西洋集团内部的分裂和混乱。
