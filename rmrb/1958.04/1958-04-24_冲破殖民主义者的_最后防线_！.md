Break Through the Colonialists' "Last Line of Defense"!
Jin Cao

In the past, Africa was called the "Dark Continent," a paradise for colonialist adventurers. Now, amidst the surging global anti-colonialist movement, colonialists see Africa as their last stronghold and arena. Brown MacDonaugh, a British bank owner who has been involved in colonial activities in Africa for thirty years, said of the situation in Africa: "We must not forget that whether the Commonwealth can continue to be a major force in world affairs in the future depends mainly on whether we can achieve final success in Africa." American bourgeois journalist John Gunther wrote: "A large part of Asia has been lost, Africa remains." Africa is "extremely important to the Western world, not only because it is strategically important and full of extremely important raw materials, but also because it is our last line of defense."

However, while the colonialists are still dreaming their beautiful dreams, the dawn has broken, and the African people have stood up. The African people are engaged in unremitting struggles to destroy the shackles of colonialism and to fight for national independence and the right to live.

Kenya in Combat

Kenya is a British colony in East Africa. Britain has maintained over a hundred years of colonial rule here. But in recent years, British colonial rule has suffered heavy blows.

As early as 1952, the people of Kenya launched a vigorous armed struggle. The patriotic organization "Mau Mau" not only established the "African Liberation Army" to carry out extensive armed struggle, but also established its own organs of power, propaganda organs, and mobile arsenals. The British colonialists carried out brutal suppression of the armed people of Kenya. In this country with a population of just over six million, they built 120 concentration camps, imprisoning nearly 90,000 patriotic people. In October 1956, Kimathi, the leader of the "Mau Mau" armed forces, was unfortunately captured and sentenced to death by hanging in February 1957. However, these barbaric acts failed to intimidate the Kenyan people. Countless patriots still took up arms and fought the colonialists in the jungles and swamps.

On the other hand, Britain also played tricks to amend the so-called "constitution," increasing the number of African representatives in the Legislative Council in order to win over certain Africans and paralyze the Kenyan people's struggle. However, some "moderate" African members selected by Britain, after being elected, immediately took a tough stance against Britain, refusing to take positions in the cabinet and again demanding an increase in the number of African members. In this way, the newly created British colonial machine stalled as soon as it started.

The People of Cameroon
Persist in Armed Struggle

In 1957, the struggle of the people of Cameroon for national independence and unity made new progress. The Cameroonian underground armed forces quickly developed in the Sanaga Maritime and Bassa regions of Douala port, as well as in the northwest region. The struggle of the Cameroonian people was met with bloody suppression by the French colonialists. Many leaders of the Cameroon People's Union were forced into exile abroad. After the NATO Paris Conference in late August last year, France successively sent eight battalions and two companies of troops to Cameroon. The French colonialists carried out barbaric massacres against the unarmed people of Cameroon. They massacred more than 480 people in the village of Baham and imposed curfews in areas such as Sanaga Maritime. According to recent news, many remote villages in rural areas have been burned down by the French army. Farmers were concentrated on both sides of the road and had to spend the night in the open.

However, the struggle of the Cameroonian people cannot be stopped by the French colonialists. Recently, in the Bamileke area of western Cameroon, with a population of about 500,000, an armed uprising broke out again, and the uprising is tending to spread northward. It is estimated that the total number of insurgents is 70,000 to 80,000. Many Western newspapers have called Cameroon a "miniature Algeria."

Uganda Demands "Immediate Independence"

"Immediate independence" was the loudest slogan of the Ugandan people's struggle in 1957.

In February last year, when the new British Governor took office, more than 10,000 people in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, held demonstrations, shouting slogans such as "We have had enough of British rule!" and "No more British Governors!" In early March, at a mass rally celebrating Ghana's independence, the Ugandan people shouted the slogan "Ghana is free, now it's Uganda's turn."

The British colonialists answered the people's just demands with bayonets and whips, and in early April openly refused to conduct any negotiations on the issue of Ugandan independence. The Ugandan people responded to the colonial rule of the British authorities with more resolute struggles. From May 13th, a vigorous "Week of Struggle for Immediate Independence" was held throughout Uganda. The Uganda National Congress issued a declaration demanding universal suffrage, Africans holding positions in state organs, more opportunities for Africans in industry and commerce, and maintaining the structure and unity of all ethnic groups. The Ugandan Parliament also passed a proposal requiring Britain to grant autonomy on a regular basis.

The People of Togo Oppose the "Election" Conspiracy

Togo, with an area of only 88,000 square kilometers, was ruled by the British and French colonial countries until just over a year ago. Western Togo, which accounts for two-fifths of the area, was a British "trusteeship" and has been incorporated into Ghana after Ghana's independence last year. Eastern Togo, which accounts for three-fifths of the area, is still under French colonial rule.

After Western Togo was incorporated into Ghana and gained independence, the anti-colonialist struggle of the people of Eastern Togo became more acute. In July last year, the people of Eastern Togo held grand demonstrations, and more than 80% of workers and employees also went on strike, protesting against French colonial rule.

At the end of last year, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to supervise the election of the Legislative Assembly of French Togo by the United Nations. France supports this proposal. It intends to use this election to "legally" incorporate Togo into the French Federation and continue to maintain its colonial rule.

Soon after, the election of the Legislative Assembly of French Togo will be held. This election will be a sharp struggle between the people of Togo and the French colonialists. The Togolese nationalist parties have issued a call to resolutely smash all the conspiracies of bribery, intimidation, and forgery played by the colonialists in the election.

    冲破殖民主义者的“最后防线”！
    金操
    过去，非洲被称为“黑暗大陆”，那儿是殖民主义冒险家的乐园。现在，在世界反殖民主义运动汹涌澎湃的形势下，殖民主义者又把非洲看作是他们的最后阵地和角逐场。在非洲进行殖民活动三十年之久的英国银行老板布朗·麦克唐纳在谈到非洲形势时说：“我们千万不能忘记，英联邦将来能否继续作为世界事务中的一支主要力量，主要就决定于我们在非洲能否得到最后成功”。美国资产阶级记者约翰·根室写道：“亚洲很大部分已经丧失，非洲还存留着。”非洲“对西方世界极其重要，不仅因为它在战略上是重要的，充满了极其重要的原料，而且因为它是我们最后的防线”。
    可是，当殖民主义者还在做他们的美梦的时候，黑暗已经破晓，非洲人民已经站起来了。非洲人民正为摧毁殖民主义枷锁，为争取民族独立和生活权利而进行不懈的斗争。
    战斗中的怯尼亚
    怯尼亚是英国在东非的殖民地。英国在这里已经维持了一百多年的殖民统治。但是近几年来，英国的殖民统治已经遭到沉重打击。
    早在1952年，怯尼亚人民就展开了轰轰烈烈的武装斗争。爱国组织“茅茅”，不仅建立了“非洲人解放军”进行广泛的武装斗争，而且建立了自己的政权机构、宣传机构和流动兵工厂。英国殖民主义者对怯尼亚武装人民进行了疯狂镇压，在这个人口仅六百多万的国家里，建筑了一百二十个集中营，囚禁了近九万个爱国志士。1956年10月，“茅茅”武装部队领导人基马提不幸被俘，1957年2月被判处绞刑。但是，这些野蛮的行动并未能吓倒怯尼亚人民，无数的爱国志士仍然手执武器，在丛林沼泽中和殖民主义者进行搏斗。
    另一方面，英国又玩弄手法修改所谓“宪法”，增加立法会议中非洲人代表的名额，以拉拢某些非洲人士，麻痹怯尼亚人民的斗争情绪。但是，英国挑选出来的若干“温和的”非洲议员当选以后，马上就对英国采取了强硬态度，拒绝在内阁中担任职务，并且再度要求增加非洲议员席位。这样，英国新制定的殖民机器刚刚开动就停顿了。
      喀麦隆人民
    坚持武装斗争
    1957年喀麦隆人民争取民族独立与统一的斗争有了新的发展。喀麦隆地下武装人员很快地在萨纳加海滨和杜阿拉港的巴萨地区以及西北部地区开展起来。喀麦隆人民的斗争遭到了法国殖民者的血腥镇压。喀麦隆人民联盟的许多领导者都被迫流亡到国外去。去年8月下旬北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议后，法国曾先后增派八个营和两个连的军队到喀麦隆去。法国殖民者对手无寸铁的喀麦隆人民进行了野蛮的屠杀。他们在巴哈姆村屠杀了四百八十多人，在萨纳加海滨等地区实行宵禁。据最近消息，农村里很多偏僻的村庄都被法军放火烧毁了。农民们被集中在道路两旁，夜里只好露宿在野外。
    但是，喀麦隆人民的斗争是法国殖民者阻挡不了的。最近在喀麦隆西部人口约有五十万的巴米来卡地区，又爆发了武装起义，而且起义有向北方蔓延的趋势。据估计，起义总人数达七、八万人。许多西方报纸已把喀麦隆称为“阿尔及利亚的缩影”。乌干达要求“马上独立”
    “马上独立”是1957年乌干达人民最响亮的一个斗争口号。
    去年2月，在英国新任总督就职的时候，乌干达首都坎帕拉的一万多人民举行了游行示威，高呼“我们受够了英国的统治”！“再不要英国总督！”等口号。3月初，在庆祝加纳独立的群众大会上，乌干达人民又吼出了“加纳自由了，下面应该轮到乌干达”的口号。
    英国殖民主义者竟用刺刀、皮鞭来回答人民群众正义要求，4月初更公然拒绝就乌干达独立问题进行任何谈判。乌干达人民以更坚决的斗争答复了英国当局的殖民统治。5月13日起，乌干达各地举行了轰轰烈烈的“马上独立斗争周”。乌干达国大党发表宣言，要求实行普选，由非洲人担任国家机关职务，在工商业方面给非洲人更多机会和保持各民族结构和团结。乌干达议会也通过要求英国定期给以自治的建议。
      多哥人民反对“选举”阴谋
    面积仅为八万八千平方公里的多哥，在一年多以前还是由英、法两个殖民主义国家统治的。占五分之二面积的西部多哥，是英国“托管”区，在去年加纳独立后，已经并入加纳。占五分之三面积的东多哥，目前仍处在法国的殖民统治下。
    西多哥并入加纳取得独立以后，东多哥人民反殖民主义斗争更加尖锐起来。去年7月间，东多哥人民举行了盛大的示威游行，80％以上的工人和职员也举行了罢工，抗议法国殖民统治。
    去年年底，联大通过由联合国监督法属多哥立法会议选举的决议。法国是支持这个议案的。它打算利用这个选举，“合法”地把多哥并入法兰西联邦去，继续维持它的殖民统治。
    不久以后，法属多哥即将举行立法会议选举。这次选举将是多哥人民和法国殖民主义者的一场尖锐斗争。多哥民族主义政党已经发出号召，坚决粉碎殖民主义者在选举中玩弄的贿赂、恐吓、伪造等一切阴谋。
