Xinhua News Agency, 7th. The expanded meeting of the entire committee of the China Association for the Welfare of the Deaf and Mute was held in Beijing from March 31 to April 7. The meeting decided to further develop social security work for the deaf throughout the country, and gradually enable more than one million deaf people to become laborers who are disabled but not useless, have socialist consciousness, and are cultured.

The meeting pointed out that vigorously organizing deaf people to participate in production is the most important task of the current welfare work for the deaf. Past work experience has proven that the potential for deaf people to participate in production is very large, and they can also make contributions to socialist construction. In the future, deaf welfare organizations in various places should strive for the assistance of labor, industry, handicraft and other relevant departments to gradually organize all deaf people with labor ability to participate in production. At the same time, the meeting requested deaf welfare organizations in various places to strengthen socialist ideological education for the deaf. At present, it is necessary to universally conduct education on the socialist system and future, current affairs and policies, collectivism, and organizational discipline in connection with the rectification movement, so that the deaf masses can make a great leap forward in their thinking.

The meeting also requested deaf welfare organizations in various places to actively promote cultural, educational, health and other relevant departments to vigorously carry out literacy work among the deaf, carry out mass cultural and sports activities, and universally publicize common knowledge on deafness prevention and treatment, so that deafness prevention and treatment work can be universally valued.

    大力组织聋人参加生产
    中国聋哑人福利会扩大会议作出决定
    据新华社7日讯　中国聋哑人福利会全体委员会扩大会议3月31日到4月7日在北京举行。会议决定在全国进一步开展聋人的社会保障工作，逐步使百万以上的聋人群众成为残而不废、有社会主义觉悟、有文化的劳动者。
    会议指出，大力组织聋人群众参加生产，是当前聋人福利工作最主要的任务。过去的工作经验证明，聋人参加生产的潜力很大，他们在社会主义建设中同样可以作出贡献。各地聋人福利组织今后要争取劳动、工业、手工业等有关部门的协助，逐步把具有劳动能力的聋人全部组织起来参加生产。会议同时要求各地聋人福利组织加强对聋人的社会主义思想教育工作，目前要结合整风运动普遍进行一次有关社会主义制度和前途、时事政策、集体主义和组织纪律等方面的教育，使聋人群众在思想上来个大跃进。
    会议还要求各地聋人福利工作组织积极推动文化、教育、卫生等有关部门，在聋人群众中大力进行扫盲工作，开展群众性的文娱体育活动，普遍宣传防聋治聋常识，使防聋治聋工作普遍受到重视。
