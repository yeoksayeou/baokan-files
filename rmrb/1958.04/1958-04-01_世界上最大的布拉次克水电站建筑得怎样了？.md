Brotherly Countries' Construction

    Many small villages that cannot be found on the map often become world-famous because of one event. Bratsk in the Soviet Union is such a place. This small village, located in the Siberian forest, has lived in obscurity for centuries, but with the construction of the world's largest hydroelectric power station, it is now famous throughout the world.

    Now, Bratsk has emerged as a new city. On both banks of the Angara River, large residential areas have been built for the 24,000 builders of the hydroelectric power station and their families. Various cultural facilities have been established one after another. In early March, a new cinema, a nursery, and two shops were newly completed.

    So, how is the construction of the hydroelectric power station progressing?

    As everyone knows, the construction of this hydroelectric power station, with a generating capacity of 3.6 million kilowatts, began at the end of 1954. The first two years were spent on various preparatory works. In January of last year, the construction of the cofferdam began, which was the real start of the fight against the turbulent Angara River. To block two-thirds of the riverbed of this large river, and to start on the river surface that was thickly frozen in winter, was a complex and unprecedented task. After the cofferdam was built, 1.5 million cubic meters of sand and gravel were piled on it during the short summer months to reinforce it. By the end of September, water began to be pumped out from inside the cofferdam. The powerful pumps worked for just over five days, and the bottom of the Angara River was completely exposed to the builders. Now, on the original riverbed of the Angara River, four powerful excavators, many bulldozers, and cranes are working intensely. This is preparing the foundation for the future overflow dam of the hydroelectric power station, and concrete will soon be poured on a large scale. The concrete is also ready, as two large concrete factories were recently built.

    At the end of last year, a substation was built near the hydroelectric power station construction site. It is used to receive electricity transmitted from the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station. The electricity currently used at the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station construction site is transmitted from the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station, 648 kilometers away. The original plan was to build this substation in two years, but it was completed in just one year.

    On the construction site of this world's largest hydroelectric power station, many outstanding Soviet power station builders are concentrated, and many people have very rich experience, having participated in power station construction for more than 20 years. However, young workers are the most numerous. They came from all over the Soviet Union in response to the call of the Communist Party. They are proud to be able to participate in this great communist construction project, they love their hydroelectric power station, and many people have settled down in this new city of Bratsk.

### 世界上最大的布拉次克水电站建筑得怎样了？

    世界上最大的布拉次克水电站建筑得怎样了？
    许多在地图上找不到的小村庄，往往会因为某一件事而变成世界闻名的地方。苏联的布拉次克就是这样。这个位于西伯利亚大森林地带的小村庄，默默无闻地过了多少个世纪，但随着世界上最大的水电站的修建，如今已名扬天下了。
    现在，布拉次克已经以新城市的面貌出现。在安加拉河两岸，已为水电站的二万四千名建筑者和他们的家庭盖起了大片住宅。各种文化生活设施都一个个先后建立。3月上旬又新落成了一座电影院、一个托儿所和两个商店。
    那么，水电站的建筑工程进行得怎样了呢？
    大家知道，这个发电能力为三百六十万瓩的水电站的建筑工程，是从1954年年底开始的。头两年做好了各种准备工作。去年1月，开始进行围堤的建筑工作，这也就是向汹涌的安加拉河搏斗的真正开始。要把这条大河河床的三分之二拦住，而且是在冬季结有厚冰的河面上着手，真是件复杂空前的工作。围堤建起后，为了加固它，在短短的夏季的月份中又堆放上了一百五十万立方公尺的沙土和碎石。到9月下旬便开始从围堤内抽水。强大的抽水机只工作了五天多，安加拉河的河底就赤裸裸地露在建筑者们的面前了。现在，在安加拉河原来的河底，四部强大的掘土机、许多推土机、起重机在紧张地工作着。这是在为未来水电站的溢水坝准备基础，很快就要大规模地浇灌混凝土了。而混凝土也已经准备妥当，因为不久以前刚刚建成了两座很大的混凝土工厂。
    去年年底，在水电站工地附近建成了一座变电所。它是为接收从伊尔库次克水电站输来的电力用的。现在布拉次克水电站工地所用的电力，就是从六百四十八公里外的伊尔库次克水电站输来的。这座变电所原定计划要两年建成，但结果只用了一年的时间。
    在这世界上最大的水电站工地上，集中了苏联许多优秀的电站建筑者，有不少人经验非常丰富，参加电站建筑工作已经二十多年。不过，还是以青年工人最多。他们是响应共产党的号召从全苏各地来的。他们为自己能参加这一伟大的共产主义建设工程而自豪，热爱自己的水电站，许多人已在这个新的布拉次克城安家立业了。　（君）（附图片）
