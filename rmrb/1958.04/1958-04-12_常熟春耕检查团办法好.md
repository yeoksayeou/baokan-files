    Changshu Spring Ploughing Inspection Team's Method is Good
    The Spring Ploughing Inspection Team of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, discovered a field of naked barley in the ninth team of the Second Agricultural Cooperative in Dongbin Township where the barley seedlings were lodging. However, the cooperative's cadres did not mobilize the masses to study the reasons for the lodging and find solutions. Instead, they wanted to reduce the yield target for this field from 500 jin to 250 jin. The inspection team criticized this practice and, together with local experienced farmers, conducted a serious study to find that the main reasons for the lodging were: vigorous growth of the barley seedlings, thin stems, shallow sowing, dense planting, and shallow furrows in the row planting. Later, they further discussed with the farmers and decided to first cut off four inches from the top of the barley, let the seedlings absorb dew overnight, and expose them to a good sun to harden the base of the seedlings. The next day at noon, they would use small scissors to cut off the thin barley, and then spray with phosphate fertilizer once more. Local farmers were very happy with this measure and believed that the yield could still reach 500 jin. They immediately appointed veteran farmer Zhu Dalong to be specifically responsible for the management of this wheat field, and then the entire cooperative promoted this method to overcome barley seedling lodging.

    常熟春耕检查团办法好
    江苏常熟县春耕检查团，在董滨乡第二农业社九小队田头上发现有一块元麦田麦苗倒伏。但这个社的干部没有发动群众研究倒伏原因，找出解决办法，却要把这块田的产量指标由五百斤降低为二百五十斤。检查团一面批评这种做法，一面同当地老农进行认真的研究，找出这块田麦苗倒伏的主要原因是：麦苗旺盛，棵脚细，落谷浅，麦子长得又密，条播的麦沟也开得太浅。以后又进一步同农民研究，先普遍把麦头打掉四寸，让麦苗吃一夜露水，晒一个好太阳，使麦苗下脚发硬；第二天中午再用小剪刀把细麦剪去，再喷打一次磷肥。这个措施提出后，当地农民很高兴，认为这样做产量仍可达到五百斤。当场就确定老农朱大龙具体负责管理这块麦田，接着全社都推广了这个克服麦苗倒伏办法。
