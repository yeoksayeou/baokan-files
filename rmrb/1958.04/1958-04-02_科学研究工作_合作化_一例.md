    An Example of "Cooperativization" in Scientific Research
    Bai Liao
    The example of researchers in the Polymer Physical Chemistry Group of the Institute of Chemistry assembling their own instruments demonstrates the great benefits of breaking with convention in instrument configuration and leveraging collective wisdom in scientific research. This is a concrete manifestation of the Great Leap Forward approach.

    Perhaps some might say that assembling instruments before conducting research wastes time and is not cost-effective. In fact, it saves time rather than wasting it. If they followed conventional procedures, failing to think creatively and overcome difficulties with collective wisdom, waiting for all instruments to be purchased from abroad, the result would be waiting and more waiting, often for two or three years. Sometimes, instruments from abroad are not even suitable, naturally leading to further waste. The approach of the Polymer Physical Chemistry Group researchers not only saved time and money but also enabled them to conduct more research, and of high quality. In scientific research, the Polymer Physical Chemistry Group of the Institute of Chemistry has begun to gain experience in how to achieve more, faster, better, and more economically. This is one point.

    Currently, some instruments still have to be ordered from abroad. However, the development of scientific research must have its own new tools. This necessitates combining scientific research with the improvement and creation of tools, and it requires linking science with technology. Only in this way can a solid foundation be laid for scientific research, and only then can creative scientific achievements be expected. Perhaps many researchers are not yet accustomed to doing this, which necessitates adopting a spirit of breaking with convention and undertaking a Great Leap Forward. The Polymer Physical Chemistry Group of the Institute of Chemistry is doing precisely that. This is the second point.

    Among scientific workers, some emphasize that scientific work can only be done individually and not through "cooperativization." The practice of the Polymer Physical Chemistry Group of the Institute of Chemistry vividly illustrates that if they each worked individually, they certainly would not have achieved today's success. Cooperation, joint collaboration, and leveraging collective wisdom are their greatest strengths. And it can be affirmed that if they adhere to the "cooperativization" approach and more fully utilize collective wisdom, they will inevitably achieve even greater results. At the same time, it can be seen that assembling instruments requires "cooperativization," and solving even greater and more complex scientific and technological problems requires even more "cooperativization." This is the third point.

    Of course, the most important issue is that scientific workers share a common ideology, with everything stemming from the socialist scientific enterprise. If some scientific workers still prioritize "I," constantly considering "my" fame and "my" benefits, then collaboration with others is out of the question. Collaborating because of the fear that "my" wisdom will be leaked; worried about losing "my" face if others have wisdom; fearing that the credit will not be attributed to "me" if "my" strength is insufficient and cooperation is involved. Many concerns weigh heavily. It should be recognized that the practice of scientific workers hiding in their quiet rooms to conduct "independent" and "personal" scientific work is already very outdated. Cooperation, joint collaboration, and leveraging collective wisdom are the demands of our era, and our era provides ample conditions. In collective scientific work, the role of individual scientific workers will not only not be ignored but will inevitably grow significantly. Every participant in collective scientific work can accomplish tasks that would be completely impossible to carry out alone. Only under collective work conditions is it possible to fully utilize the talents and creativity of each scientific worker.

    Many aspects of the socialist construction undertaking are experiencing a Great Leap Forward. The example of the Polymer Physical Chemistry Group of the Institute of Chemistry assembling its own instruments, as well as the comprehensive large-scale collaboration in Shanghai's scientific community, marks a new development in scientific research work. Only through "cooperativization" and joint collaboration can scientific research work keep pace with the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction.

    科学研究工作“合作化”一例
    白辽
    化学研究所高分子物理化学组研究人员自己装配仪器的事例表明，在科学研究工作中对仪器配置的打破常规、发挥集体智慧的做法大有好处。这也就是具体的跃进的做法。
    也许有人会说，那样自己先装配仪器再做研究，浪费了时间很不上算。事实上，没有浪费时间而是节省了时间。如果他们按常规办事，不动脑筋，有困难不发挥集体智慧去克服，什么仪器都等着到国外去买，结果是等待再等待，常常要等个两年三年。有时国外来的仪器还不合用，自然更是浪费。高分子物理化学组研究人员的作法，不仅省了时间、省了钱，而且也多做了研究工作，还做的很好。在科学研究工作中，如何实现多、快、好、省，应该说化学研究所高分子物理化学组开始取得了经验。这是一。
    目前有一些仪器还不得不向国外订购。但是科学研究的发展，必须有自己的新的工具。这就必须使科学研究同改进、创造工具的工作结合起来，必须使科学同技术联系起来。这样，才能够为科学研究打下坚实的基础，才能够期望有创造性的科学成果。也许许多研究人员都还不习惯这样做，这就必须拿出打破常规的精神，来个跃进。化学研究所高分子物理化学组正是这样做的。这是二。
    在科学工作者中有人强调，科学工作只能单干，不能“合作化”。化学研究所高分子物理化学组的做法生动地说明，如果他们各自单干，必然得不到今天的成绩；合作、共同协作、发挥集体智慧，正是他们最大的特色。并且还可以肯定，如果他们坚持“合作化”的做法，更充分地发挥集体智慧，他们必然将会取得更大的成绩。同时可以看到，装配仪器需要“合作化”，解决更巨大的、更复杂的科学技术问题，就更需要“合作化”。这是三。
    当然，最重要的问题在于科学工作者们的思想一致，一切从社会主义的科学事业出发。如果有的科学工作者一切仍然要从“我”出发，整天考虑的是“我”的名，“我”的利，那就必然谈不到同别人合作。合作了，怕“我”的智慧漏了；别人有智慧，怕合作了，丢了“我”的面子；“我”的力量做不到的，合作了，怕功劳不归于“我”。顾虑重重。应该认识到，科学工作者藏在自己安静的房间里进行“独立的”、“个人的”科学工作的作法，已经是很陈旧的了。合作、共同协作、发挥集体智慧是我们时代的要求，我们的时代给予了充分的条件。在集体的科学工作中，科学工作者个人的作用不但不会被忽视，而且必然会有很大的增长。集体的科学工作中的每一个参加者，都可以完成那些在单干时完全没办法进行的工作。也只有在集体工作的情况下，才有可能充分发挥每一个科学工作者的才能和创造性。
    社会主义建设事业的许多方面都在跃进。化学研究所高分子物理化学组自己装配仪器的事例，以及上海科学界的全面大协作，正标志了科学研究工作的新发展。只有“合作化”、共同协作，科学研究工作才能赶上社会主义建设大跃进的新形势。
