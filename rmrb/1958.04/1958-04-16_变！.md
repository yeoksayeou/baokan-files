Change!
\tQin Liang

Our country is changing everywhere, changing at every moment. Changing rapidly, changing profoundly, changing on a large scale. This is an important feature of the era we live in. How many barren lands of flying sand and moving stones have become windbreak forests with lush greenery. How many remote mountain valleys with poor mountains and evil waters have become fertile fields yielding hundreds of catties per mu. Dry land has become water land, and waterlogged land and saline-alkali deserts have become granaries. Now, Anhui Province is going to massively change the planting in the Huaibei area, which has been planting miscellaneous grains for centuries, to rice, turning Huaibei into Jiangnan, and increasing production by one, two, or even several times.

This is no longer just a heroic slogan that inspires mountains and rivers. They have been experimenting, expanding experiments, and expanding experiments again for several years. The results of the experiment prove that what many people say that Huaibei soil is not suitable for growing rice is completely untrue. Rice can be harvested here as abundantly as in Jiangnan.

Our country's superstructure serves its economic base very well. The People's Government transferred a large number of farmers, cadres, and technicians from Huainan and along the Yangtze River who are good at growing rice to Huaibei to teach people how to grow rice. It also transferred Huaibei farmers and cadres who are eager to learn rice-growing techniques to Huainan and along the Yangtze River to learn. At the same time, it organized many counties in Huainan and Huaibei to find objects and sign teaching contracts with a county, contracting teaching and learning. They have made many achievements in this regard in the past few years, and now they are further expanding the scale and doing it boldly. This year, they will expand the one million mu of rice in Huaibei to eight million mu, a full eight times! Huaibei, this disaster-stricken area, will be transformed from our hands into a rich and happy land. And obviously it won't take too much time.

The peasants who have accepted the ideological education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the peasants who have resolutely abandoned private ownership and the small-peasant economy, regard helping brother regions increase production as the same as increasing production in their own hometown. Dike building, land leveling, installing waterwheels, soaking seeds, cultivating seedlings, making seedbeds, transplanting seedlings, field management, harvesting, manufacturing and using rice farming tools... They teach this whole set of complex techniques from beginning to end without tiring, and resolutely guarantee a bumper rice harvest in Huaibei. Who says farmers are conservative and backward?

"Which soil nurtures which people. If Huaibei could grow rice, our ancestors would have grown it long ago!" In the old days, this statement could be said to make sense and stand. However, now such words have no place at all. Peasants in the socialist era must abandon the backward production level left by their ancestors, and at the same time abandon the backward thoughts and viewpoints produced by that backward level. Huaibei can grow rice! It's just a pity that our ancestors were bound by the exploiting classes, the exploitative system, and the small private system, and could not see this possibility. Or, some of them saw it and had that kind of ideal, but had no power to turn the ideal into reality. They could only bitterly endure their lives!

Now, everything is about to change! Everything is changing! Water network, rice cultivation, turning Huaibei into Jiangnan, turning compatriots who have been poor for centuries into wealthy and civilized beneficiaries, this is our great historical mission today!

    变！
    秦良
    我们的国家到处在变，时刻在变。迅速地变，深刻地变，大规模地变。这是我们所处的时代的重要特征。多少飞沙走石的不毛之地，变成了绿林成荫的防风林带。多少穷山恶水的荒僻山沟，变成了亩产数百斤的肥沃良田。旱地变成了水地，沥涝地和盐碱沙荒变成了米粮川。现在，安徽省要在多少世纪以来一直种杂粮的淮北地区大规模改种水稻，把淮北变为江南，把产量提高一倍、二倍以至好几倍。
    这已经不只是一个气壮山河的英雄口号。几年来他们一直在试验，扩大试验，再扩大试验。试验的结果，证明许多人所说的淮北土壤不适于种水稻完全不是事实。这里种水稻同江南一样可以丰收。
    我们国家的上层建筑为自己的经济基础很好地服务着。人民政府把大量的善于种水稻的淮南和沿江农民、干部和技术人员调到淮北去教人们种水稻，也把急于学习种水稻技术的淮北农民和干部调到淮南和沿江去学习，同时组织淮南和淮北的许多县份各自找对象、找一个县订教学合同，包教包学。几年来他们在这方面做出了许多成绩，现在更进一步扩大规模，大刀阔斧地干了起来。今年他们要把淮北的一百万亩水稻扩大到八百万亩，整整八倍！淮北这个多灾多难的地区，将从我们手里变成富饶的乐土。而且显然要不了太多的时间。
    接受了共产党和人民政府的思想教育的农民，毅然抛弃了私有制和小农经济的农民，他们把帮助兄弟地区增产看做自己家乡的增产一样。打埂、整地、安水车、泡种、育秧、做秧田、插秧、田间管理、收割、水田农具的制造和使用……这样一整套复杂的技术，他们都不辞劳累地从头教到尾，坚决地保证淮北种水稻丰收。谁说农民是保守落后的呢？
    “哪一方土养哪一方人。淮北要能种水稻，我们的祖宗早就种了！”在旧时代，这种说法是满可以说得通，站得住的。然而，现在这样的话完全没有地位了。社会主义时代的农民要抛弃自己祖先遗留下来的落后生产水平，也就要同时抛弃那个落后水平所产生的落后思想和观点。淮北是能够种水稻的！只可惜我们的祖先被剥削阶级、剥削制度和小私有制度束缚着，看不到这种可能。或者，他们中间有人看到了，有过那种理想，但是没有力量把理想变成现实。他们只能苦苦地熬过自己的一生！
    如今，一切都要变了！一切都在变了！水网化，水稻化，把淮北变成江南，把穷苦了多少世纪的同胞变成富裕和文明的享受者，这就是我们今日的伟大历史使命！
