Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th – Anhui farmers are currently engaged in a large-scale crash program to plant sunflowers, castor beans, and pumpkins. Statistics up to the 17th show that the province has already planted 2.1 billion sunflower plants, an average of 64 per person; 5.8 billion castor bean plants, an average of 178 per person; and 750 million pumpkin plants, an average of 22 per person. The planting of sunflowers and castor beans has already exceeded the targets set by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

In late February, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued instructions "on making extensive use of barren hills, wasteland, and vacant land beside houses to plant sunflowers, castor beans, and pumpkins," and farmers throughout the province enthusiastically responded to the call. At present, various regions are continuing to rush planting.

    安徽农民突击栽种向日葵
    新华社合肥19日电　安徽农民正在大规模地突击栽种向日葵、蓖麻和南瓜。到17日的统计，全省已经种向日葵二十一亿棵，平均每人六十四棵；蓖麻五十八亿棵，平均每人一百七十八棵；南瓜七亿五千万棵，平均每人二十二棵。向日葵和蓖麻已经超过中共安徽省委提出的种植指标。
    中共安徽省委2月下旬曾发出“关于大量利用荒山、废地、宅旁空地，种植向日葵、蓖麻和南瓜”的指示，全省农民热烈地响应号召。目前各地仍在继续突击赶种中。
