Mancheng County Adopts Various Methods to Encourage Farmers to Reform Agricultural Tools

(Our dispatch) Since January 1st of this year, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, has created and reformed 32 kinds of production tools, assembling 4,150 larger new production tools. Currently, various methods are being adopted to encourage farmers to reform agricultural tools.

In order to improve labor efficiency and promote the great leap forward in production, the Mancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to all party members, cadres, and the broad masses on January 1st of this year: "Everyone should use their brains, everyone should find tricks, and everyone should create or reform a production tool." This call aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses to reform old agricultural tools and create new ones. In just two months, the county reformed nine kinds of old-fashioned agricultural tools, such as wooden plows for both water and dry land, and automatic leather belt waterwheels; invented and created 24 kinds of new agricultural tools; and replaced 2,700 wooden-wheeled handcarts with rubber tires.

In order to further encourage the masses to invent and create and boldly innovate, the Mancheng County People's Committee recently issued interim measures for rewarding inventions and creations. The regulations stipulate that all inventions and creations that are in line with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical in the production leap forward will be given commendations, medals, certificates, flags, material objects, and cash rewards based on the value of the creation. The county and townships have also established invention and creation evaluation committees, and a system of awarding prizes once a season has been established. (Zhang Hua)

    本报讯　从今年1月1日开始到现在，河北省满城县已经创造和改革了生产工具三十二种，装成较大型的新生产工具达四千一百五十件。目前正采取各种办法鼓励农民进行农具改革。
    为了提高劳动效率，促进生产大跃进，中共满城县委于今年1月1日，向全县的党员、干部和广大群众发出了“人人动脑筋、个个找窍门、每人创造或改革一件生产工具”的号召。这一号召唤起了广大群众改革旧农具、创造新农具的革命干劲，仅两个月的时间，全县就改革了水、旱两用木耧、皮带自动水车等旧式农具九种；发明创造了新农具二十四种；有两千七百辆手推木轮车换成了胶轮。
    为了进一步鼓励群众发明创造、大胆革新，满城县人民委员会最近又发布了奖励发明创造的暂行办法。规定凡在生产跃进中合乎多、快、好、省的发明创造，均根据创造价值，分别给予表扬、奖章、奖状、奖旗、实物和现金奖励。县、乡并建立了发明创造评审委员会，规定一季进行一次评奖的制度。　（张华）
