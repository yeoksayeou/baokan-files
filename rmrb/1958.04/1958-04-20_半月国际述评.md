    Bi-Weekly International Review
    (April 4th to 18th)
    The Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing has won the support and praise of billions of people worldwide; while the United States and Britain have repeatedly refused to halt nuclear weapons testing, further exposing their unwillingness to reach an agreement and ease international tensions, which cannot but arouse the indignation of the broad masses of people. The struggle of people of all countries to stop nuclear weapons testing and oppose the arming of West Germany with atomic weapons is intensifying. In the Asian and African regions, the Indonesian government and people have achieved a decisive victory in defending independence and opposing foreign interference. The Conference of Independent African States is underway. At this conference, a resounding call against colonialism was issued by the African people. Intense fighting has repeatedly broken out in Algeria, and the French Gaillard government, deeply mired in colonial war, has collapsed in desperation. These are the more important events of the past half-month.
    Sharp Contrast, Most Powerful Education
    After a period of intense struggle, the people of the world see more clearly that all peace-loving people must unite and continue to struggle, forcing the imperialist countries, led by the United States, to sit down and negotiate an agreement to ease international tensions.
    The Soviet government officially announced the cessation of nuclear weapons testing from March 31, 1958, and called on the United States and Britain, which possess nuclear weapons, to take the same action. However, the United States and Britain not only repeatedly rejected the Soviet proposal, but also intensified atomic preparations in Europe. The recent NATO Defense Ministers' meeting not only approved the plan to equip West German troops with atomic weapons, but also discussed Norstad's plan to establish missile bases in five or more countries, including Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey, agreeing to double the number of ground troops in Western Europe. Even more infuriating is the fact that American bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs have flown toward the Soviet border through the Arctic region more than once. These things form a sharp contrast, opening people's eyes. For the sake of human peace and tranquility, a growing movement to demand the cessation of nuclear weapons testing has been launched worldwide in the past half-month.
    The Soviet Union's cessation of nuclear weapons testing has been welcomed and supported by the governments of all peace-loving countries, even those participating in the American military bloc. Socialist countries have successively issued statements actively supporting the Soviet proposal. The Prime Ministers of India, Ceylon, Thailand, and Pakistan, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, the President of Austria, the United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, the governments of the United Arab Republic and Japan, as well as Sweden, Canada, and other countries, have also expressed their welcome, and many countries have requested that the United States and Britain take similar steps. All this shows that the United States and Britain's attempt to downplay the significance of the Soviet Union's leading cessation of hydrogen bomb testing is a waste of time.
    Among the broad masses of people, the most indicative of mass sentiment is the active mobilization of the people of Britain and the United States to demand that their governments stop nuclear weapons testing, as well as the West German people's resolute struggle against "atomic death."
    From April 4th to 7th, thousands of people in Britain held a "peace march," departing from London and walking fifty miles in rain, snow, and severe cold to the Aldermaston Atomic Weapons Research Center, demanding an end to hydrogen bomb testing. Participants in this procession included workers, students, veterans, scientists, religious figures, and members of parliament. On the 13th, a demonstration of more than 10,000 people was held in London to stop nuclear weapons testing, led by an 86-year-old woman. In the United States, scientists and ministers of different churches also jointly demanded that the government stop nuclear weapons testing; participants in the "Walk for Peace" movement held demonstrations and petitioned the United Nations delegations of the United States and Britain. Four Americans determined to sacrifice themselves have sailed a small boat across the ocean to the American nuclear weapons testing area in the Pacific to protest American criminal activities.
    In Europe, the Foreign Ministers of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic held a meeting in Prague from April 10th to 12th, protesting West Germany's atomic armament and once again proposing the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Two thousand representatives from France and Italy gathered in Turin on the 12th and 13th to oppose the establishment of missile bases in the Alps. People from all walks of life in West Germany are increasingly determined to stand up against Adenauer's warmongering policies. The city councils of Frankfurt, Wiesbaden, and Mülheim passed resolutions to hold referendums on the issue of atomic armament and refused to provide land for the establishment of missile bases and the storage of atomic weapons. West Berlin and Hamburg launched a week of struggle against atomic armament. On the afternoon of the 7th, 150,000 people in Hamburg held a rally against atomic war preparations. Workers in major cities in the Ruhr area and many other industrial cities went on strike. West German youth also joined with French and Dutch youth to initiate a European youth conference to oppose West German atomic armament. The West German opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, demanded a referendum. The wave of protests from the West German people has made the ruling group panic, and they have even revealed that they want to declare a "national emergency" to suppress the people's actions against atomic armament.
    In the face of the global surge of demands for peace, the United States and Britain have also attempted to take other measures to divert people's attention. After the Soviet Union announced its decision to stop nuclear weapons testing, the United States, Britain, and France proposed to the Soviet Union that ambassador-level talks be held in Moscow to prepare for a foreign ministers' conference. In order to promote the early convening of a high-level meeting, the Soviet Union then suggested that consultations between diplomatic representatives be held in Moscow on April 17 to arrange a foreign ministers' conference, and proposed that a foreign ministers' conference be convened no later than the end of April or the middle of May. The three Western countries have now agreed to begin diplomatic preparatory meetings for the highest-level conference in Moscow on April 17. However, even if this diplomatic preparatory meeting has begun, it does not mean that Western countries are truly willing to hold high-level talks. While agreeing to conduct preparatory meetings, the United States, Britain, and France have proposed that the substantive issues of the highest-level conference be discussed at the preparatory meeting. It can be seen that Western countries are still trying to use this to delay the convening of the foreign ministers' conference and the highest-level conference. Naturally, their position is becoming increasingly difficult.
    Victory of the Indonesian People
    Since the Hussein, Sjafruddin, Simbolon and other rebellious elements colluded with imperialism to carry out open rebellion in Sumatra, they had temporarily created major difficulties for Indonesia's anti-colonial struggle and provided imperialism with an opportunity to openly interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs. However, this conspiracy, because the rebellious elements exposed their faces of betraying national interests and colluding with imperialism, aroused the opposition of the people throughout the country. The rebel group had hoped that more regions and islands would echo them, and that it would attract open interference from imperialism. But the fact was the opposite of what they thought. Under the threat of foreign interference, the people of all Indonesia became more united and launched a resolute struggle against foreign interference. With the support of the people of Asia and Africa and all peace-loving people, imperialism was forced to withdraw its hands. The Indonesian government, with the support of the people throughout the country, also adopted resolute measures to suppress the rebellion, launching an offensive against the rebel group on March 10. Over the past month, the government forces have been winning victories, causing the rebel group to retreat to a corner of Padang and Bukittinggi. On April 17, the government forces launched a joint offensive of the army, navy, and air force, directly attacking the rebel headquarters from the sea and from the air, and captured Padang in one fell swoop. The government forces dealt a fatal blow to the rebel group. Now, the remaining issue is just clearing up the remnants of the rebels.
    This is a new victory for the Indonesian people in the anti-colonial struggle. The imperialists' attempt to undermine Indonesia's struggle to safeguard national independence and drag Indonesia into their military bloc through internal reactionary elements has met with a shameful failure.
    Africa, Stand Up!
    Another thing that surprised the imperialists was the Conference of Independent African States, which is currently being held in Ghana. This is the first conference of Africans in African history.
    The African continent has always been called the dark continent. Centuries of enslavement and plunder by imperialism have brought indescribable disasters to the African people. However, the days of suffering will eventually come to an end. The eight African countries that have gained independence, Ghana, the United Arab Republic, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Sudan, Ethiopia, and Liberia, gathered in the capital of Ghana. This conference not only expressed the desire of countries that have already gained independence to defend their independence and sovereignty, but also issued a call of "No interference in Africa, Africa must be free," to support and help the people in all unliberated regions of Africa to gain freedom and independence. African countries must not only manage African affairs, but also participate in the ranks of world affairs. The representatives of various countries have expressed positive views on arms reduction, the prohibition of nuclear weapons testing, etc., making their own contributions to easing international tensions. The conference has adopted a course of action to support Algeria, and the participating representatives have called on France to stop its irrational massacre and grant Algeria independence. This is strong support for the Algerian people who are currently at the forefront of the struggle.
    However, colonialists will not willingly withdraw from Africa. The tense and complex situation currently emerging in North Africa precisely illustrates this point. France continues to conduct brutal colonial war in Algeria, and has committed the crime of bombing the peaceful residents of Sakiet Sidi Youssef on the Tunisian border, causing a serious dispute between Tunisia and France. American imperialism, which has long planned to take France's place, seized the opportunity to enter. The United States took advantage of the dispute between France and Tunisia and came out as a mediator to "mediate." Since February 22, when the United States began its "mediation," its ambitions have been fully exposed in these two months. The cunning United States is attempting to use Tunisia's anti-French sentiment to suppress France, relinquish colonial interests in North Africa, and further open a way for American oil capitalists to make money and seize the oil fields of the Sahara; on the other hand, it is using France's stubborn attitude to oppress Tunisia, forcing Tunisia to give up part of its sovereignty and make concessions on issues such as the withdrawal of French troops and the return of the Bizerte port, and through Tunisia, it will influence and contain Algeria's national liberation struggle, thereby preparing conditions for the United States to manipulate the situation in North Africa. In this way, the contradictions between the United States and France have become apparent.
    The Gaillard government's insistence on colonial war, coupled with its subservience to the United States, has not only been opposed by the French Communist Party and the people, who safeguard the interests of the French nation and advocate a peaceful resolution to the Algerian issue, but also by the French right-wing groups. What the right-wing groups are pursuing is to strengthen military dictatorship and implement a more barbaric policy of suppression against Algeria. Therefore, they are also dissatisfied with the Gaillard government's weakness and its blind submission to the United States, handing over North African interests. Under the opposition of a majority of parliamentarians, the French Gaillard government finally collapsed on April 16. However, as the French Communist Party Central Committee pointed out in its statement: Only a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue can extricate France from its predicament. Currently, French fascists are stirring up trouble, attempting to establish a military dictatorship government. This is something that the French people firmly oppose. In this crisis of the French government, fierce struggles will take place between different political forces in France. The only way out for France is, as proposed by the French Communist Party, to establish a government of left-wing parties and achieve peace in Algeria through negotiations.

    半月国际述评
    （4月4日到18日）
    苏联单方面停止核武器试验的行动，已经赢得了全世界亿万人民的拥护和赞许；而美国和英国一再拒绝停止试验核武器，越发暴露了美国和英国不愿意达成协议、缓和国际紧张局势的真面目，这不能不激起广大人民的义愤。各国人民要求停止核武器试验和反对用原子武器武装西德的斗争，日趋激烈。在亚非地区，印度尼西亚政府和人民，已经取得了捍卫独立、反对外国干涉的决定性的胜利。非洲独立国家会议正在进行。在这个会议上，发出了非洲人民反对殖民主义的宏亮号召。阿尔及利亚激战屡起，深陷在殖民战争的法国盖伊阿政府，又在走头无路中倒台了。这些就是最近半个月里比较重要的事件。
    鲜明的对比　最有力的教育
    经过最近期间的紧张斗争，全世界人民更加看得清楚了：一切爱好和平的人们，要团结起来，继续斗争，强迫以美国为首的帝国主义国家，坐下来谈判，达成缓和国际紧张局势的协议。
    苏联政府正式宣布从1958年3月31日起，停止核武器试验，并且呼吁拥有核武器的美英两国政府，采取同样行动。可是，美国和英国不仅一再拒绝苏联的建议，并且在欧洲加紧了原子备战的活动。最近举行的北大西洋集团国防部长会议不但批准了用原子武器装备西德军队的计划，并且讨论了诺斯塔德关于在英、法、意、荷、土五国或更多国家里建立导弹基地的计划，同意了在西欧增加地面部队一倍。而更加令人愤怒的是，带有原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机，竟不止一次地通过北极地带向苏联边界飞行。这些事情形成了一个鲜明的对比，擦亮了人们的眼睛。为了人类的和平和安宁，半个月来，在世界范围里，掀起了日益广泛的要求停止核武器试验的运动。
    苏联停止核武器的试验，获得了一切爱好和平国家的政府、甚至参加了美国军事集团的国家的政府的欢迎和支持。社会主义各国先后发表声明，积极支持苏联的建议。印度、锡兰、泰国、巴基斯坦等国的总理，柬埔寨的首相，奥地利总统，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，印度尼西亚外长，阿拉伯联合共和国以及日本政府，瑞典、加拿大等国也都表示欢迎，并且有许多国家要求美英采取同样步骤。这一切，说明了美国和英国企图贬低苏联率先停止氢弹试验的意义，是白费心机的。
    在广大人民中间，最足以说明群众情绪的，就是英美两国人民积极行动起来，要求本国政府停止核武器试验，以及西德人民展开了“反原子死亡”的坚决斗争。
    4月4日到7日，英国几千人举行了“和平出征”，从伦敦出发，冒雨雪严寒步行五十英里，到原子武器研究中心阿尔德马斯顿，要求停止氢弹试验。参加这一行列的，有工人、学生、退伍军人、科学家、宗教界人士和议员。13日在伦敦举行了一万多人的停止核武器试验的游行示威，作为队伍的前导的是一位八十六岁高龄的妇女。在美国，科学家、不同教会的牧师，也联名要求政府停止核武器试验；“为和平而奔走”运动的参加者，举行了示威，并且向美英两国的联合国代表团请愿。四个抱着牺牲决心的美国人，已经驾了一艘小艇，横渡重洋，直驶美国在太平洋上核武器试验区域，抗议美国的罪恶活动。
    在欧洲，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国三国外长，4月10日到12日在布拉格举行会议，抗议西德进行原子武装，再一次提出建立中欧无原子武器地区的建议。法国、意大利的两千代表，12、13日集会都灵，反对在阿尔卑斯山设立导弹基地。西德各阶层人民越来越坚决地起来反对阿登纳的好战政策。法兰克福、威斯巴登和米耳海姆等三个市的市议会，通过就原子武装问题举行公民投票，并且拒绝提供建立导弹基地和储存原子武器的土地。西柏林和汉堡市，展开反对原子武装斗争周。7日下午，汉堡十五万人举行了反对原子备战的大会。鲁尔区的各大城市和许多其他工业城市，工人举行罢工。西德青年并且联合法国和荷兰青年，发起召开欧洲青年会议，反对西德原子武装。西德的反对党——社会民主党，要求举行公民投票。西德人民的抗议怒潮，使得统治集团惊惶不安，竟透露出要宣布“全国紧急状态”，来镇压人民反对原子武装的行动。
    在全世界要求和平的怒潮前面，美国和英国也曾企图采取别的办法，来转移人们的视线。当苏联宣布决定停止核武器试验之后，美、英、法就向苏联提出，在莫斯科举行大使级会谈，为外长会议作准备。苏联为了促使高级会议的早日召开，接着建议4月17日在莫斯科举行外交代表的协商，安排外长会议，并提出最迟不过4月底5月中旬，召开外长会议。现在西方三国已同意4月17日在莫斯科开始举行最高级会议的外交预备会议。但是，即使这种外交预备会议已经开始了，这并不意味着西方国家真正愿意举行最高级会谈。美英法在同意进行预备会议的同时，提出了预备会上要讨论最高级会议的实质问题。可见，西方国家仍企图借此拖延外长会议和最高级会议的召开。自然，它们所处的地位是越来越困难了。
    印度尼西亚人民的胜利
    自从侯赛尼、沙弗鲁丁、西姆波朗等叛乱分子，勾结帝国主义，在苏门答腊实行公开叛变，曾一时给印度尼西亚的反殖民主义斗争，制造了重大困难，并且给予帝国主义以公开干涉印度尼西亚内政的可乘之机。但是，这一个阴谋，由于叛乱分子暴露了出卖民族利益、勾结帝国主义的面目，激起了全国人民的反对。叛乱集团曾经指望会有更多的地区和岛屿附和他们，会招来帝国主义公开的干涉。可是事实却正和他们所想的相反。在外国干涉的威胁下，全印度尼西亚人民团结得更坚强了，展开了反对外国干涉的坚决斗争。在亚非人民和一切爱好和平人民的支持下，迫使帝国主义不得不缩回手去。而印度尼西亚政府，在全国人民支持下，又采取了坚决镇压叛乱的措施，3月10日发动了对叛乱集团的进攻。一个多月来，政府军节节胜利，使得叛乱集团退缩到巴东、武吉丁宜的一隅。4月17日政府军发动陆、海、空军的联合进攻，从海上，从空中，直捣叛军老巢，一举攻克巴东。政府军对叛乱集团给予了致命的一击。现在，剩下的问题，只是清扫叛军残余了。
    这是印度尼西亚人民在反殖民主义斗争中一个新胜利。帝国主义妄想通过内部的反动分子，破坏印度尼西亚的维护民族独立的斗争，把印度尼西亚拉入它们的军事集团，这个恶毒的策划已遭到了可耻的失败。
    非洲，站起来了！
    使得帝国主义大吃一惊的另一件事，就是最近正在加纳举行的非洲独立国家的会议。这是非洲有史以来的第一次非洲人的会议。
    非洲大陆，一向被称为黑暗的大陆。帝国主义几百年的奴役和掠夺，给非洲人民带来了难以形容的灾难。但是，苦难的日子终有尽头的。经过长期奋斗，获得了独立的八个非洲国家，加纳、阿拉伯联合共和国、摩洛哥、突尼斯、利比亚、苏丹、埃塞俄比亚和利比里亚，在加纳首都集会。这次会议，不仅表现了已经获得独立的国家，要保卫自己的独立和主权的愿望，并且发出了“不要干涉非洲，非洲必须自由”的呼声，要支持和帮助非洲一切没有解放的地区的人民，获得自由和独立。非洲的国家不仅要管理非洲的事务，并且参加到世界事务的行列里来。各国代表对于裁减军备、禁止核武器试验等等，都发表了积极的意见，为缓和国际紧张局势，作出自己的贡献。会议已经通过了支持阿尔及利亚的行动方针，与会代表们纷纷要求法国停止无理性的屠杀，给予阿尔及利亚以独立。这是对于目前正处在斗争最前线的阿尔及利亚人民有力的支持。
    然而，殖民主义者是不会甘心退出非洲的。目前在北非出现的紧张复杂的局势，正是说明了这一点。法国继续在阿尔及利亚进行残暴的殖民战争，并且犯下了轰炸突尼斯边境上萨基埃特村和平居民的罪行，引起了突尼斯和法国之间的严重争端。久已蓄谋取法国的地位而代之的美国帝国主义，于是乘机而入。美国利用了法国和突尼斯的争执，以调停人的面目出来“斡旋”。从2月22日，美国开始了“斡旋”，在这两个月里，已经把美国的野心暴露无遗。狡猾的美国，企图利用突尼斯反法情绪，来压制法国，让出北非的殖民利益，并进而可以为美国石油资本家打开一条生财之道，夺取撒哈拉的油田；另一方面，又利用法国的顽固态度，来压迫突尼斯，迫使突尼斯放弃一部分主权，在撤退法军、归还比塞大港等问题上作出让步，并且通过突尼斯，影响和遏阻阿尔及利亚的民族解放斗争，从而为美国操纵北非局势准备条件。这样，美国和法国的矛盾就表面化起来。
    盖伊阿政府坚持殖民战争，又加上屈从美国，不仅遭到维护法兰西民族利益、主张和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的法国共产党和人民的反对，并且也遭到法国的右翼集团的反对。右翼集团所追逐的，是加强军事独裁，对阿尔及利亚实行更加蛮横的镇压政策。因而，他们也不满盖伊阿政府的软弱和一味屈从美国，把北非利益拱手让人。在大多数议员反对之下，4月16日，法国盖伊阿政府终于垮台了。但是，正像法共中央声明中指出的：只有和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，才可能使法国脱出困境。目前法国的法西斯分子正在兴风作浪，妄想建立军事独裁政府。这是法国人民所坚决反对的。在这一次法国政府的危机中，法国国内的不同政治力量将会发生激烈的斗争。法国唯一的出路，就是法国共产党提出的，建立左翼党派的政府，通过谈判来实现阿尔及利亚和平。
