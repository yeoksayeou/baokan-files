    The people of Yulongzhen Village in the Tago District had a wish for many years: to build a water canal and bring the mountain water to the fields. The masses also found a place to build the canal, but four stubborn rocky mountain peaks blocked the path of the canal, and people tried various methods with great effort but could not overcome this obstacle.
    Because of the lack of water, farmers often quarreled and fought over water in the spring, and incidents of armed fighting and injuries occurred frequently. Many lands often could not be planted, and even if they were, there was little harvest. As a result, people gradually moved away from here. The place once known as the "village of a hundred households" now has only twelve households left. Gesang's family was also preparing to move to another village because it was difficult to survive. At the end of last year, the masses of this village placed their hopes for changing their fate on the Communist Party and sent six representatives to request assistance from the CPC Tago Working Team. The Party Committee of the Working Team immediately agreed to the people's request and sent cadres to the village to survey the terrain, lend various tools, supply explosives, and specifically organize and help the villagers dredge the waterway.
    On January 15th and 16th, after continuous explosions, the stubborn rocks were blasted open, and water truly flowed into the thirsty fields. The people of Yulongzhen Village were infinitely grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao. Gesang, who was originally preparing to flee, began to build fences and troughs again. Village Chief Najia said excitedly, "You have brought endless benefits to our children and grandchildren."

    一条水渠的诞生
    塔工区鱼龙真村的群众，多少年来就有一个愿望：修一条水渠，把山里的水引到田里。群众也找到了修水渠的地方，但是在这条水渠经过的地方却有四个顽石山嘴拦着，人们费了很大力气，想了种种办法都克服不了这个障碍。
    因为缺水，一到春天，农民们为抢水而经常吵嘴打架，械斗伤人的事也曾不断发生。很多土地常常不能下种，种了也没有什么收获，因此人们逐渐从这里搬走，号称“百户之村”的地方现在只有十二户了。格桑一家也因为不好生活下去，准备搬到外村去住。去年年底这个村的群众把改变自己命运的希望寄托到共产党身上，就派了六个代表，请求中共塔工工作队给予援助。工作队党委立即答应了群众的要求，并派了干部去该村踏看了地形，借给各种工具，供给炸药，具体组织与帮助该村群众疏通水道。
    1月15日和16日，经过连续爆炸，顽石炸开了，水真正流到了如饥如渴的田里。鱼龙真村人民无限感激党和毛主席。原来准备外逃的格桑，又着手架围墙、垒马槽了。村长纳加激动地说：“你们给我们的子子孙孙带来了说不完的好处。”
