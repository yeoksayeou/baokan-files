    Mass singing activities are being carried out in various parts of Anhui Province. More than 20,000 rural clubs across the province have organized tens of thousands of singing teams. Rural clubs also conduct singing lessons through various meetings and by utilizing folk schools, fields, water conservancy construction sites, and other venues. In Hongqi Cooperative, Fu'e Township, She County, there are an average of two singing instructors in each production team. Now, many people in this county have learned songs such as "Socialism is Good" and "Ode to the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program."

    欢乐歌声响四方
    安徽省各地正在开展群众性的歌咏活动。全省二万多个农村俱乐部已组织几万个歌咏队，农村俱乐部还通过各种会议和利用民校、田间、水利工地等活动场所进行教唱。歙县富堨乡红旗社平均每个生产队就有二个教唱员，现在，这个县很多人已学会了“社会主义好”、“歌唱农业纲要四十条”等歌曲。芜湖市还准备组织万人大合唱，庆祝“五一”节。
