This rising star in the Chinese chess world, from a poor peasant family and only thirty-three years old this year, has loved chess since he was a child. He once worked as a peddler and a tailor. After participating in chess activities at Guangzhou Cultural Park in 1956, he actively participated in Party class studies, and his political awareness has greatly improved. During the recent Two-Anti movement, he actively helped the Party to rectify its work style and wrote many big-character posters.
