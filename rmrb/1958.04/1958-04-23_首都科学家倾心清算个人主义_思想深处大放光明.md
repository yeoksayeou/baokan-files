Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd. The self-reform movement of ideological exchanges and heart-to-heart talks, which is being enthusiastically carried out in Beijing's scientific circles, has made the corrupt bourgeois individualism ideology thoroughly exposed for the first time under the socialist sunshine. In the movement, many people consciously dug out the unspeakable things deep in their minds.

After the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing provided the experience of scientists' ideological self-examination, unnecessary concerns such as fear of losing face and prestige were dispelled. At the same time, promoted by the leading self-examinations of party member scientists and heads of research institutes (sections), the first batch of more than eighty senior researchers voluntarily requested to examine themselves first and to be the focus of examination. Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Physics, Qian Xuesen, Director of the Institute of Mechanics, Hua Luogeng, Director of the Institute of Mathematics, Yang Zhongjian, Director of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology, Shi Ruwei, Director of the Institute of Applied Physics, Hou Defeng, Director of the Institute of Geology, Ye Zhubei, Director of the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy, Dai Fanglan, Director of the Institute of Applied Mycology and other famous scientists took the lead in making self-examinations, which promoted more researchers to consciously devote themselves to the movement. Liu Hongyun, associate researcher of the Institute of Geology, has always been very dissatisfied with the Party and doubted the Party's policies. This time, he told the organization and his comrades frankly about this thinking and his historical problems.

In this ideological exchange and heart-to-heart movement, scientific workers revealed how bourgeois individualism ideology is damaging scientific undertakings and socialist construction in every possible way. What is more dangerous is that many people mistakenly believe that the pursuit of individualist fame and fortune, like serving the people and serving socialism, is also a driving force for making contributions to the people and socialist construction. They emphasize that individualist fame and fortune thoughts are not contradictory to serving the people and serving socialism. Some people, under the cover of this self-deceiving fallacy, seek personal fame and fortune with peace of mind. For personal fame and fortune, some people can ignore the urgent needs of the country and the national plan, and concentrate on their own "black topics"; they can work independently, without collaboration with their peers, and even repel each other, neutralizing strength and forming "internal friction"; in order to elevate themselves, they deliberately belittle the research work and research results of others, suppressing the development of other disciplines; some people regard knowledge as capital for fame and profit, and are unwilling to impart their knowledge to others without reservation; some people see that the level of some colleagues is higher than their own, and would rather give up their major to gnaw on others... A scientist in a leading position suppressed a colleague's book for three years and refused to let it be published, fearing that its publication would belittle his own similar works; some people often use the research results of others to write their own papers; some people add their own names when revising other people's articles, or even erase the names of others and replace them with their own; plagiarism in academic works is not an isolated phenomenon either. Because these bourgeois thoughts and behaviors have never been thoroughly exposed and criticized, they have become increasingly serious and have hindered academic prosperity.

In this ideological exchange movement, there are already signs that scientific workers are beginning to change. A researcher at the Institute of Economics used to keep historical materials from the Opium War and other sources and refused to allow relevant research institutions to use them. Now he has voluntarily handed over all these historical materials to the public. A scientist compiled a scientific dictionary with multilingual comparisons, which had been completed for a long time, but he had refused to publish it, fearing that others would use his dictionary to write papers and become famous. Now he has taken it out for publication. Some people who were originally politically backward have become activists in this movement. Some communists who have always thought that they have already become "red" now also realize that they still have a lot of individualistic thoughts, and they still need to make great efforts to reach the standard of "red." The young people in the research institutions, seeing that the old scientists are also striving for progress in this way, and seeing that bourgeois individualism cannot be retained even by the old scientists, it is of course not the ideal future for young people. A heated challenge and competition of self-reform has thus unfolded between young people and old scientists. Now, this movement is in full swing, and there are touching examples everywhere.

The depth of this movement is not only reflected in the fact that many people are brave and happy to expose their shortcomings, face up to their shortcomings, and have already begun to change in action, but also in the fact that they are brave to expose the shortcomings of others and enthusiastically help others to reform. At the Institute of Applied Physics, there were more than 800 big-character posters exposing and criticizing the ideological problems of one researcher. Many researchers have dozens or even hundreds of big-character posters criticizing and exposing their shortcomings.

Scientific workers who have exchanged their hearts all show a relaxed and cheerful mood. Just like Feng Xizhang, a researcher at the Institute of Physics, said to the young people after examining his own thoughts: "Only by handing over your heart and knowledge to the Party and the people without reservation is the most pleasant thing. Now I feel like I'm about to fly! The past vigor was for the individual, but today's vigor is for socialism."

The ideological exchange and heart-to-heart movement in the Beijing research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is carried out in various ways: there are peer meetings between scientists, there are fellow meetings held according to business groups, there are large meetings and small meetings, and there are also heart-to-heart talks freely combined in twos and threes. Some research units invited relevant experts from outside the academy to talk heart-to-heart when scientists exchanged ideas and hearts, and the effect was even better.

On the basis of ideological exchange and heart-to-heart talks, scientific workers in Beijing's research institutions are beginning to turn to thematic debates and formulate plans on the two major issues of "red and expert" and "theory and practice."

### 首都科学家倾心清算个人主义  思想深处大放光明

    首都科学家倾心清算个人主义
    思想深处大放光明
    新华社22日讯正在热烈进行的北京科学界思想见面、互相交心的自我改造运动，使腐朽的资产阶级个人主义思想在社会主义的阳光下第一次彻底暴露。在运动中，许多人自觉地挖出了思想深处的见不得人的东西。
    中国科学院北京各研究单位的研究人员在地球物理研究所首先提供了科学家思想检查的经验以后，解除了怕丢面子、怕失威信等不必要的顾虑，同时在党员科学家和研究所（室）的负责人带头检查的推动下，第一批就有八十多名高级研究人员自动地要求首先检查自己和作为检查重点。物理研究所所长钱三强、力学研究所所长钱学森、数学研究所所长华罗庚、古脊椎动物研究所所长杨钟健、应用物理研究所所长施汝为、地质研究所所长侯德封、化工冶金研究所所长叶渚沛、应用真菌学研究所所长戴芳澜等著名科学家都主动地带头作了检查，推动了更多研究人员自觉投入了运动。地质研究所副研究员刘鸿允历来对党很不满，怀疑党的政策，这次他把这种思想以及自己历史上的问题都向组织、向同志们痛快地讲了出来。
    在这次思想见面和交心运动中，科学工作者们揭发出资产阶级个人主义思想如何无孔不入地损害着科学事业，损害着社会主义建设。更危险的是许多人错误地认为追求个人主义的名利同为人民、为社会主义服务一样，也是一种对人民对社会主义建设作出贡献的动力，他们强调个人主义名利思想同为人民为社会主义服务是不矛盾的。有些人就在这种自欺欺人的谬论掩护下，心安理得地猎取个人名利。有些人为了个人名利，他们可以不顾国家迫切需要和国家计划，专心搞自己的“黑题目”；可以各搞各的，和同行不协作，甚至互相排斥，使力量抵消，形成“内耗”；为了抬高自己，故意贬低别人的研究工作和研究成果，压制其他学科的发展；有些人把知识当作成名获利的资本，不愿意把自己的学问无保留地传授给别人；有的人看到有的同行的水平高过自己，宁可放弃本门专业去啃别的……。有一个担任领导工作的科学家把别人的一本著作压了三年还不让发表，怕发表以后会贬低了他自己的同类著作；有的人经常利用别人的研究成果写自己的论文；有的人在修改别人文章的时候，加上自己的名字，甚或抹去别人的名字代之以自己的名字；学术论著中的剽窃行为也不是个别的现象。就因为这些资产阶级的思想行为从未彻底暴露和被彻底批判，以致越来越严重，对学术繁荣起了阻碍作用。
    在这次思想见面运动中，已经有迹象可以看出科学工作者是在开始转变了。经济研究所的一个研究员过去保存着鸦片战争和其他史料，一直不肯给有关研究机关应用，现在他自动把这些史料全部交公了。有一个科学家编了一本有好几国文字对照的科学辞典，脱稿已有多时，却一直不肯出版，怕别人借助于他的辞典去写论文出名。现在他拿出来出版了。有一些原先在政治上落后的在这次运动却成为积极分子。有些一向自以为已经红了的共产党员，现在也正视到自己的个人主义思想还很多，要达到红的标准，尚须作很大努力。各研究机构中的青年人，看到老科学家也这样要求进步，看到资产阶级个人主义思想在老科学家身上也已经保留不住，当然更不是青年人的理想前程。青年人和老科学家之间于是展开了热烈的自我改造的挑战和竞赛。现在，这种运动正方兴未艾，随处都有感人的事例。
    这次运动的深刻不仅表现在许多人勇于和乐于暴露自己的缺点、正视自己的缺点并且已在行动中开始转变，而且表现在勇于揭发别人的缺点，热心帮助别人改造。在应用物理研究所，揭发和批判一位研究员的思想毛病的大字报就有八百多张。许多研究人员都有数十甚至数百张大字报批评和揭露他们的缺点。
    交了心的科学工作者们，都呈现出一种轻松开朗的心情。正像物理研究所研究员冯锡璋自己检查思想后对青年们说的：“只有毫无保留地将心和知识交给党和人民，才是最愉快的事，现在我简直要飞起来了！过去的朝气是为了个人，今天的朝气却是为了社会主义。”
    中国科学院北京各研究机关的思想见面和交心运动是采取多种方式进行的：有科学家之间的同辈会，也有按业务小组召开的同行会，有大会也有小会，还有三三两两自由结合的谈心。有的研究单位在科学家思想见面互相交心时，邀请了院外的有关专家一起谈心，效果更好。
    在思想见面和交心的基础上，北京各研究机关的科学工作人员正开始转入“红与专”、“理论与实际”两大问题的专题辩论和制定规划。
