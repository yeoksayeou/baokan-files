    Changing "Nickname"
    Harbin Printing Worker Liu Ruxi

    If you ask about Wang Xiquan, most likely seven or eight out of ten people won't know him; but if you mention "Eight Hundred and Five," everyone will understand. Eight Hundred and Five is Wang Xiquan's nickname. No one knows who started calling him that, but everyone calls him that now.

    The origin of this nickname goes way back.

    Wang Xiquan is a type compositor. Four years ago, the factory held a general meeting to discuss the quotas for each type of work. When discussing the average hourly type-setting quota, some said over two thousand, some said fifteen or sixteen hundred, and some said twelve or thirteen hundred. Wang Xiquan disagreed with these figures. He stood up in a huff and bluntly fired the first shot: "Don't forget that type-setting is done by hand! Not by machine. What two thousand, one thousand, that's just talk!"

    "Then what quota do you suggest?" someone asked.

    Wang Xiquan thought for a moment, then blurted out three words – Eight Hundred and Five!

    Buzz—The whole audience burst into laughter, as if the roof was about to be blown off. One or two mischievous young men even clapped and cheered him on. The nickname "Eight Hundred and Five" probably became famous from that time on.

    This nickname stuck to Wang Xiquan perfectly. Indeed, when he worked, he was like a clock with a broken spring, unable to wind up. You see him standing in front of the type case, as if he's reading someone's fortune, his eyes staring blankly; his hands are like a machine without oil—sluggish. He had been like this for several years.

    Since the rectification campaign, the stagnant water in Wang Xiquan's heart had also been stirred up. Every day he typeset stacks and stacks of manuscripts, full of new things. One leaping forward condition after another, what big claims! Those words, those numbers, were simply earth-shattering. You wouldn't even dare to imagine them, but people were already doing them. The numbers on the manuscripts seemed to have grown wings, changing every second. As soon as a manuscript was typeset, the proofs were revised; after the complete edition was made, the large proofs were revised with new numbers again, and even when it was on the machine about to be printed, it had to be changed with the latest new numbers. This change can truly be described as earth-shattering! Even a stone man or an iron brain would have to be deeply affected and enlightened.

    Although Wang Xiquan didn't show much change on the surface, his heart was churning, like boiling porridge. He looked at the people around him, all like fully drawn bows, full of energy. His colleagues Lao Zhang and Lao Huang, who were in the same grade, both proposed plans to double their output. When Wang Xiquan saw this, even his face, which rarely turned red, flushed. He couldn't help but think to himself: I'm also five feet tall, I have all my arms and legs, and while others are running in front, I'm taking square steps behind, what kind of working class person is that!

    Just then, Little Liu, who had just finished his apprenticeship, posted a big-character poster challenging Master Wang by name. A novice wants to compete with a veteran, how exciting! "Okay! Whoever dares not compete is a coward!" Wang Xiquan gritted his teeth and immediately wrote a big-character poster. It didn't say much, just one line of big characters, writing: "Guarantee to reach three thousand characters per hour within three months - Wang Xiquan." Heavens! This number was the best in the whole factory. As soon as this news spread, it became factory news. Some people argued that the young soldier was pushing the old general too hard, and blurted out something reckless in the heat of the moment. People who knew Wang Xiquan's temperament were not sure about this move. Everyone knew that Wang Xiquan had a stubborn strength, and he would do what he said. He was always conservative in what he said, but he would always exceed expectations when he worked. Take the quota discussion four years ago, for example, although he said eight hundred and five, he never fell below a thousand characters.

    Wang Xiquan did not regret what he said. He secretly vowed: Just wait and see.

    In the past two months, his true abilities have been revealed. His type-setting record, like crops that have been sufficiently fertilized, has been soaring upwards. The row of red lines on the plan chart, which used to be ahead of him, were leveled in a few days; in the blink of an eye, he surpassed others. His personal record was flipping upwards like a somersault. With a burst of energy, he even reached the target of three thousand characters. Some people murmured behind his back: "Could it be that Eight Hundred and Five has gained some kind of Taoist power?!" Indeed, how could it not be surprising that he rose from the ground to the sky. The next day after this was said, Wang Xiquan broke through the frame at the top of the chart. Although he was still using his hands, not a machine, he felt like he had an engine installed in his heart.

    The big red bulletin announcing Wang Xiquan's record-breaking achievement was posted in the most conspicuous place. Everyone who saw it praised it endlessly. Some said: "I didn't expect that 'Eight Hundred and Five' has become so fierce!" Some said: "Now you can't look at people with old eyes!" Someone proposed again: "The nickname Eight Hundred and Five doesn't suit him anymore, it has to be changed." What would be suitable? After some consideration, everyone decided to call him "Surpassing Fierce Tiger." Without any voting ceremony, Wang Xiquan's new nickname was approved in people's hearts and mouths.

### 换“外号”

    换“外号”
    哈尔滨印刷工人　刘如玺
    你要打听王喜全，大半十有七八不知道；你要提“八百五”，可全晓得。八百五是王喜全的外号，不知是谁先叫开头的，反正大家都这么叫。
    说起这个外号的来历，话可远啦。
    王喜全是拣字工。四年前，厂子开大会讨论各工种的定额，在讨论到平均每小时拣字定额时，有人说两千出头，有人说一千五六，也有说一千二三的。王喜全对这些说法不以为然。他气冲冲地站起来，粗声粗气地劈头冒了一炮：“别忘了拣字用的是手啊！不是机器。什么一千两千的，那是说着玩的嘛！”
    “那你说定多少？”有人问。
    王喜全稍一思索，便腾地冒出三个字——八百五！
    嗡——全会场的人一声地乐了，像要鼓开房盖似的。一两个挑皮的小伙子，还拍巴掌给他叫倒好哩。“八百五”这个外号，大概就是从那时候出的名。
    这个外号，贴到王喜全身上，真是不偏不斜，恰到好处。的确，他干起活来，就像断了条的钟表，怎么也上不上劲儿。你看他站在字架前边，就像跟谁相面，眼睛直睖睁；手也像没浇油的机器——发滞。几年来，他就是这样一个劲儿。
    从打整风以来，王喜全心里的一湾死水也吹皱了。他每天拣着一叠一叠的稿子，尽是新鲜事。一个个跃进条件，多大的口气呀。那些字眼，那些数字，简直悬天悬地的。你都不敢想的，人家可做出来了。稿子上的数字，仿佛长了翅膀，一分一秒都在变。稿子刚拣完，小样便改了；成完版，大样又改过新的数字，甚至推上机器临要开印了，还得更换最后一次新数字。这个变化，真称得上翻天复地！就令是石头人，铁脑筋，也得入骨三分，也得开窍。
    王喜全表面上虽然看不出多大变化，心里可直翻腾，活像开锅的粥。他看看周围的人，个个都像拉满的弓，劲头崩足。同级工的老张、老黄，都提出翻一番的跃进计划，王喜全看了，就连那不轻易红的脸皮，也一阵火辣。不禁暗自思忖：自己站起来也五尺来高，不缺胳臂，不少腿，人家在前面跑，自己在屁股后迈方步，这还算什么工人阶级！
    正在这当儿，才满徒不久的小刘，贴出一张大字报，指名要跟王师傅挑战。新手要跟老手比试高下，这真叫劲呀。“好哇！谁不敢比谁是孬种！”王喜全心一横，马上写了一张大字报。话不多，只一行大字，写着：“保证在三个月内达到每小时三千——王喜全”。天哪！这个数全厂霸头。这事一传开，便成了全厂新闻了。一种议论，说是小兵将老帅，将急了，一时说冒了话。摸着王喜全脾气的人，都不敢断定这步棋。大家知道，王喜全有个牛劲，说得出就做得出。平时总是说得保守，干起来却要出点头。就拿四年前讨论定额来说，虽然他说八百五，可是总也没掉下一千字来。
    王喜全说了并不后悔。他暗中发奋：等着瞧吧。
    这两个月来，可真看出成色来了。他的拣字纪录，像上足了粪的庄稼，一个劲的往上窜。计划表上的一排红线，原来在他前面的，几天就拉平了；一转眼，又赶在别人前面了。他的个人纪录折个子似的往上翻。一鼓劲，竟达到了三千字的指标。有人背后嘀咕：“八百五敢情是得了什么道行！？”是呵，他从地上一跃升天，怎能不叫人惊奇呢。说这话的第二天，王喜全就把图表顶端的框框冲破了。虽然他仍然用的是手，不是机器，但是他心里却像装了一部发动机。
    王喜全首破厂纪录的大红榜，贴在最显眼的地方了。谁看了都赞叹不休。有的说：“想不到啊，‘八百五’变得这么凶！”有的说：“现在可不敢拿老眼光瞧人喽！”不知又是谁提议：“八百五这个外号配不上他了，得换个。”换个什么合适呢？大伙一捉摸，就叫个“赛猛虎”吧。用不着什么表决仪式，王喜全这个新的外号，就在人们心里和口头上通过了。
