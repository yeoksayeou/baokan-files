Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 5th: A new group of Soviet polar explorers, equipped with the latest equipment, has departed from Leningrad for the Arctic. They will explore the secrets of the Arctic seabed dating back hundreds of thousands of years.

This group of explorers includes approximately forty people, including hydrologists, geophysicists, geomagneticians, and upper-air meteorologists. They are going to the Arctic to replace the personnel at the "North Pole 6" and "North Pole 7" floating ice stations. The team going to "North Pole 7," led by Associate Doctor Belov, is equipped with new instruments that can extract soil samples from three to seven meters below the seabed surface. This will allow them to study the development of the Arctic seabed approximately six to seven hundred thousand years ago and determine whether the Lomonosov underwater mountain range was once above or always below the water surface. They will also study the heat content of the Arctic ice.

The scientists going to the "North Pole 6" station, led by Associate Doctor Sherlapov, will establish ten automatic meteorological drifting stations in various regions of the Arctic; study the properties and origins of sea ice; and study Arctic ice and hydrology according to the International Geophysical Year plan.

    苏联又一批科学家去北极  探查几十万年前海底秘密
    新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联一批新的极地考察人员已经带着最新的设备从列宁格勒出发前往北极。他们将去探索北极几十万年前的海底秘密。
    这批考察人员中包括水文学家、地球物理学家、地磁学家、高空气象学家等四十人左右。他们是去北极替换“北极六号”和“北极七号”浮冰科学站的人员的。去“北极七号”的由贝洛夫副博士领导，他们带着一种新的器械，可以把海底土壤表面以下三至七公尺深的土壤样品取上来，从而研究北极约六、七十万年以前的海底发展情况，确定洛蒙诺索夫水底山脉过去是在水面以上还是一向在水底下的。此外他们还要研究北极冰层的含热量。
    去“北极六号”站的科学人员由谢尔拉波夫副博士领导，他们将在北极各地区建立十个自动气象漂浮站；研究海洋冰层的性质和起源并按地球物理年计划研究北极冰层和水文学。
