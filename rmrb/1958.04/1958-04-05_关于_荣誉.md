    On "Honor"
    Lü Lin
    Whenever we see a good performance, we have this feeling: Although the performers are not famous, and we may not even remember their names, as we leave the theater, we always praise them aloud or secretly applaud them in our hearts. The performers may not hear the spoken praise, and they have no way of knowing the silent applause in our hearts, just as the performers are not famous to us and therefore we don't remember their names; however, this is a kind of honor.

    Any ordinary person can have their honor. Whether it is a traffic policeman – when he orderly directs the chaotic traffic, alertly stops a reckless bicycle, and protects a flustered old lady crossing the street, preventing her from being knocked down; whether it is a salesperson – when she deftly handles the crowded customers, patiently allows the picky customer to finally choose the item that best suits their wishes, and tries to find a way to deliver the out-of-stock goods to the anxious customer who has already asked several stores; ... the beneficiaries will be grateful, and the onlookers will tacitly approve, and this, for the traffic policeman, the salesperson, ..., is also honor, although they do not know or hear people's gratitude and tacit approval, even though people do not know their names, and do not even notice the number on their uniform.

    Honor is labor for the people, contribution in labor – even if it is just a little bit. Honor exists even in anonymity; it is not just about having fame and status. Fame and status are greater honors, given because of the greater contribution of labor for the people. It is not the cause of honor, but only the result of honor. Fundamentally, it is laboring for the people and making contributions. Therefore, any ordinary person can have honor at any moment, as long as they are doing so.

    We have a watch on our wrist, and we use it to keep track of time. Time is told to us by the hour, minute, and second hands on the surface of the watch, and therefore what we pay attention to daily are these hands. Of course, we can also know from this their importance in displaying the time. However, as soon as we open the back of the watch, we will see that what drives the hour, minute, and second hands to display the time is also due to the complex machinery inside; and each delicate component plays a certain role in the display of time by the hands on the surface. It is only because we rarely have the need to open it that we often only see the movement of the hour, minute, and second hands.

    People's labor has different forms due to the nature of their work, but in the final analysis, its essence is collective. In our lives, we often mention "individual labor," but this is only one form of labor of a certain nature. Who can name a purely "individual" labor? The labor of a writer has great individuality, but can his works be circulated without being edited, typeset, printed, and proofread? Even if it only relies on the writer's own handwriting to circulate, can its content not originate from the people's lives and struggles? Can its techniques be separated from the experience of predecessors and contemporary writers and the influence of works from ancient and modern times? If it is said that some of these are mainly due to the writer's own talent, then the ability to master writing, which is the most basic condition of his labor, is it innately endowed or self-made? It can be seen that even this labor with great individuality is like the hour, minute, and second hands on the surface in displaying time, also has the role of countless internal "components."

    Thus, the concept of honor needs to be expanded; honor is labor for the people, contribution in labor, and this labor contribution is certainly seen in individuals, but it always has a collective role, and therefore honor is ultimately collective, it belongs to the masses of people who are engaged in collective labor, and the individual who embodies this labor contribution enjoys the main share of it.

    Our socialist system will not bury anyone. As long as someone makes a slight contribution in labor for the people, it will be relatively easy to become famous. People who have gained some fame, status, and any bit of honor should understand that their honor is a pre-payment that needs to be repaid with more labor and greater contributions, and should not be regarded as an acknowledgment of their labor contribution that is far from excessive.

    And those vast laborers scattered in various positions, working diligently day after day, silently dedicating every bit of their energy to the people, without seeking fame or wealth, such people, though ordinary, are beautiful. Because they are like gold dust in a desolate sandy river, although scattered in the sand grains, and not easily discovered at first glance, they shimmer with a trace of golden light under the sunshine of communism!

### 关于“荣誉”

    关于“荣誉”
    吕林
    每当看了一次好的演出，我们都会有过这样的感觉：尽管表演者并不著名，有的甚至记不得他的名姓，在我们步出剧场的时候，总会交口称誉或者在心底里暗自赞许。在表演者，这口头的称誉虽然未能听到，而那心底的赞许更无由知道，正如表演者对我们并不著名因而不记得他的名姓；然而这，便是一种荣誉。
    对于任何一个普通的人，都可以有他的荣誉。不论是交通警察——当他在他井然地指挥着纷杂的车辆之中，机警地制止了一辆鲁莽的自行车，而护住一位慌张过街的老太太，免致撞倒；不论是售货员——当她在她敏捷地应接着拥挤的顾客之际，耐心地让那好挑剔的顾客也终于挑选到最合他心意的一件，想方设法把售缺的货物交到那已经问了几家的急需的顾客手里；……身受者会感激，旁睹者会默许，这在交通警察、售货员、……，也便是荣誉，虽然人们的感激和默许他并不知道、并未听到，尽管人们不知道他们的名字，甚至他们制服上的号数也未及留意。
    荣誉，就是为人民的劳动，劳动中的贡献——那怕是一点点。荣誉，在不相闻知中也是存在，并不只在于有了名望、地位。名望、地位是较大的荣誉，因其为人民劳动的贡献较大而给予。它并不是荣誉之因，而只是荣誉的果。根本的，是为人民劳动着，而有贡献。因而任何一个普通的人，也时刻会有着荣誉，只要他是这样在做。
                                ＊
    我们的手腕上有一只表，靠它掌握时间。时间由表面的时针分针和秒针告诉我们，因而我们日常所注意到的，是这时针分针和秒针。当然，由此也可以知道，它们在显示时间上的重要。然而，只要打开表的背面，就会看到，推动时针分针和秒针之显示时间的，也还由于内部的复杂的机器；而其中每一精巧的机件，对于表面的时针分针和秒针在显示时间上，都起它一定的作用。只是由于我们很少有必要打开它，才往往只看到时针分针和秒针它们在运动。
    人们的劳动，因其工作的性质而有不同的方式，但归根到底，它的本质是集体。在我们的生活中常常提到“个体劳动”，这不过是一定性质的劳动的方式之一种。有谁能说出一种纯粹的“个体”劳动？作家的劳动具有极大的个体性，但他的作品能不经过编、排、印、校而行之于世？即便它只靠作家自己的手抄而流传，然而它的内容能不源于人民的生活和斗争？它的技巧能够离开先辈与同代作家的经验的借鉴和古往今来的作品的熏陶？如说这一些也主要由于作家本人的才能，则作为他的劳动的最基本的条件的掌握文字的能力，难道是先天赋予或者是自我造就？可见，就是这具有极大的个体性的劳动，也犹如那表面的时针分针和秒针之在显示时间上，还有着内在的无数“机件”的作用。
    这样，关于荣誉的概念就还需要扩充；荣誉是为人民的劳动、劳动中的贡献，这劳动贡献固然见诸于个人，但它始终有着集体的作用，因而荣誉最终是集体的，它归于集体劳动着的人民群众，而体现这劳动贡献的个人，则是享有其中主要的一份。
    我们的社会主义社会制度是不会埋没任何人的。只要有人在为人民劳动中稍有贡献，相对地就会容易出名。有了一些名望、地位以及任何一点荣誉的人，对于自己的荣誉，应该理解为这是需要以更多的劳动和更大的贡献来偿付的预支，而不能当作这是对他的劳动贡献的远不为过的承认。
    而那广大的散在各种岗位上的劳动者，日复一日地勤苦劳动，把自己的精力的每一点每一滴暗暗献给人民，不求闻达，这样的虽是平凡的人，却是美丽的。因为，他们像那荒僻的沙河里的金屑，虽然散杂在沙粒里，粗一看去不易为人所发现，但它们在共产主义的阳光的照射下，闪耀着一丝丝金色的光芒！
