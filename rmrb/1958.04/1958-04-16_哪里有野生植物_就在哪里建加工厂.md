This dispatch from Chengdu on the 15th by our reporter, Fan Gui, comments on the significance of Sichuan's use of wild plants to promote the development of industry and agriculture: In the anti-conservatism and anti-waste movement, the industrial, handicraft, and supply and marketing departments of Sichuan Province conducted in-depth debates on two ideologies and two methods for developing mountainous areas and local industries. This has allowed the province’s wild plants to "enter the hall" and radiate brilliantly, leading local industries into a new stage in the utilization of wild plants.

Sichuan Province began utilizing wild plants in 1956. Currently, more than 360 kinds of wild fibers, oilseeds, starches, fruits, and chemical raw materials have been discovered throughout the province. Among these, wild fibers alone number 141 species, with estimated resources of about 6 million dan. If fully utilized, this would be equivalent to the cotton production of 8 million mu of cotton fields. There are 46 kinds of wild starches that can replace grain for brewing and sizing, with a production of no less than 30 million dan. If all four types—including the Qinggangzi, Kudzu root, and Tufuling—are fully utilized, 450,000 dan of wine can be brewed, saving the country 110 million jin of grain. The utilization of these resources is not only related to increasing farmers' income but also to promoting the development of local industries, among other fundamental issues. However, this beneficial undertaking for the country and the people has not received sufficient attention in the past two years.

After the start of the "Double-Anti" movement, tens of thousands of big-character posters from Sichuan Province's supply and marketing, service, and other departments focused on the issue of not allowing these natural resources to be wasted. They explored the reasons why wild plants had not been fully utilized in the past. The main reason for the commercial departments was the failure to start from a production point of view, and there was conservatism in management, such as fear of trouble, fear of stockpiling waste, and fear of losing money. The industrial departments believed that there were difficulties in processing technology and had doubts about utilization and use, failing to fully combine them with the province's characteristics and actual conditions to solve the people's problems of eating, clothing, and using. During the debate, everyone agreed that now is the time to fully utilize wild plants. They summarized the experiences of various places in utilizing wild plants over the past two years. For example, Beichuan County, located in the mountainous area of northern Sichuan, used to consume 800,000 jin of wine annually. Due to insufficient brewing raw materials such as sorghum and corn, half of it had to be supplied from other places every year. Last year, they successfully brewed wine using wild starches such as Fern moss and Kudzu root, and in that year, they changed from lacking wine to being self-sufficient. This year, 20 new wineries have been added in the county, all using substitutes for brewing, with a planned output of 2 million jin, of which 1.2 million jin can be transferred to other places in addition to the county's own consumption. Since September last year, the Chongqing Municipal Industrial Bureau Research Institute has collected more than 100 kinds of wild fibers in more than 30 counties throughout the province, and it has been proven that 20 kinds can be spun into yarn and woven into cloth. Among them, five kinds of fibers, including cotton stalk skin, oleander, and ramie, have been successfully spun and woven by machine. In addition, ten other kinds of wild fibers, such as mulberry bark and paper mulberry bark, have also been successfully spun and woven by hand in combination with cotton. In the past, Chongqing's textile industry felt it difficult to increase the production of cotton cloth due to insufficient raw materials. Now, due to the successful utilization of wild fibers, they have requested the provincial supply and marketing department to supply 7,000 tons of rayon raw materials this year. In this way, the situation of Chongqing's textile industry not having enough to eat can be changed.

However, some people still have various concerns: Can the raw materials of wild plants be supplied for a long time? Can the quality of the products meet the requirements? Are consumers willing to use them? In fact, this kind of worry is superfluous. The service departments of Sichuan Province conducted investigations in Guangyuan, Beichuan, Wangcang, Tongjiang, and other places, and the local wild starch resources are renewed and circulated on a 20-year cycle and will never be exhausted. Every year, in addition to the county's own needs, there is half or more than half of the surplus. As long as the wild fibers and oilseeds are not eradicated when collected, they can also be used inexhaustibly. Some varieties, such as Thatch and Arrowroot, can also be cultivated artificially to meet the needs. As for the quality of products manufactured using wild plants, as long as the technical treatment is appropriate, not only can the quality requirements of general products be met, but also high-grade products can be manufactured. The Shashi and Yuhua textile factories in Chongqing respectively used ramie and hemp to blend into 21, 22, and 23 count fine yarns, and made more than 20 varieties of printed bedspreads, towel blankets, pillow towels, and various fancy socks in various colors. The dyeing, gloss, and tensile strength were better than pure cotton yarn fabrics. The Southwest First Silk Factory spun wild hemp into 80-count high-grade fine yarn, and the quality and gloss exceeded ramie. Now, the Chongqing Textile Industry Company has woven it into brightly colored silk-filled tweed. The beverage wine brewed with acorn has similar color, aroma, and taste to sorghum wine, and general drinkers reflect that its quality is better than molasses beverage wine. At the first national brewing conference, acorn wine has been rated as first-class wine. The roasted glue made from red roots and oak cups in Chengdu, Wanxian, and other places can be compared with imported roasted glue, but the price is about one-third cheaper than imported goods. The brilliant achievements of this emerging cause have opened the eyes of many people with conservative ideas, forcing them to make a major revolution in their thinking and actions.

From the perspective of various parts of Sichuan, the staff of relevant departments are now showing a hundred times the revolutionary vigor, reorganizing their troops, and continuing to advance towards wild plants. Under the guidance of the principle of "large-scale purchase and sale, fully expand utilization," the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to purchase generally about ten times more wild plants this year than last year. Among them, the fastest growth is in wild starch, with a planned purchase of 6 million dan, 300 times more than last year; the purchase of wild oilseeds is 340,000 dan, 61 times more than last year. The entire province requires that the procurement task with a total value of 360 million yuan be guaranteed to be completed this year. Grassroots supply and marketing cooperative cadres in Nanchong, Wanxian, Fuling, and other regions expressed their determination to "break through barren mountains and open treasure houses" and set off a climax throughout the province of "demanding wine, sugar, oil, and flour from the deep mountains; demanding paper, hemp, and glue from the old forests."

Hundreds and thousands of large and small wild plant processing plants have also begun to be established one after another. Now, the first wild fiber processing plant in the country has been built in Santai and officially put into production, producing 300 jin of finished wild fiber products every day. Among the four acorn glue furfural factories, essential oil factories, yellow cardboard factories, and wild fiber degumming factories that Chengdu plans to build this year using wild plants as raw materials, two factories have already started construction and will be put into production this year. Fengjie County is also planning to build 42 small wild plant processing plants. The Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative will successively build eight large processing plants with a daily output of 60 dan of rayon and 30 small processing plants with a daily output of 30 dan of rayon in Suining, Daxian, Wanxian, Nanchong, Wenjiang, and other regions; in addition, simple processing plants will be built in mountainous areas. The investment in these factories is very small, with large factories costing no more than 40,000 or 50,000 yuan, and small factories costing 2,000 or 3,000 yuan. Most of them can be put into production within the year. The technical force needed to establish these factories is also being trained. Chengdu, Wanxian, Santai, and other three places have opened wild fiber processing training courses, where more than 1,000 people have learned fiber degumming and processing techniques. The industrial departments of Chongqing and Chengdu are concentrating their efforts to solve the technological problems of large-scale spinning and weaving of various wild plants in order to expand the utilization of resources. Recently, in order to adapt to this new production characteristic, the industrial and commercial departments of the province have put forward a new slogan of "Three Going Up the Mountains": First, the commercial network should go up the mountains, striving for farmers to "buy goods without leaving their homes and sell goods without leaving their villages," so as to promptly purchase rural products; second, technology should go up the mountains, and fully excavate the treasures in the deep mountains and old forests by means of publicity, exhibitions, and training technicians for agricultural cooperatives in batches; third, processing plants should go up the mountains, turning the origin of raw materials into a processing base, moving the factory to wherever there are raw materials, and making every effort to comprehensively utilize the raw materials. For example, some wild plants can be used for brewing wine, refining sugar, and as feed. At present, this vigorous production upsurge has brought tremendous impact to industrial, handicraft, and commercial work, and the efforts to improve these departments are the key to promoting the development of industry and agriculture.

From the current development trend, Sichuan Province's utilization of wild plants will become a widespread mass movement. As long as we break through all conservative ideas and outdated concepts, fully recognize the importance of this emerging cause, and strengthen the coordination and mutual support of industrial, agricultural, commercial, and scientific research institutions, a new situation will surely emerge in the entire local industry of Sichuan.

    哪里有野生植物  就在哪里建加工厂
    本报成都15日电　记者范胿评述四川利用野生植物，促进工农业发展的意义说：四川省的工业、手工业和供销社等部门，在反保守反浪费运动中，对发展山区经济和地方工业的两种思想、两种方法进行了深入的大辩论，使全省野生植物“登堂入室”发出奇光异彩，使地方工业在利用野生植物方面进入了一个新的阶段。
    四川省利用野生植物是从1956年开始的。目前，全省已经发现的各种野生纤维、油料、淀粉、果品和化工原料，已有三百六十多种。其中仅野生纤维就有一百四十一种，估计资源约有六百万担，全部利用起来，相当于八百万亩棉田的棉花产量。能代替粮食酿酒、浆纱的野生淀粉的有四十六种，产量不下三千万担。如把其中的青杠子、葛根、土茯苓等四种全部利用，可酿酒四十五万担，为国家节约粮食一亿一千万斤。这些资源的利用，不仅关系到增加农民收入，还关系到促进地方工业发展等根本性质的问题。但是，这样一件利国利民的好事，近两年来却一直没有受到足够的重视。
    “双反”运动开始后，四川省供销、服务等部门的几万张大字报集中地提出了不能让这些自然资源白白浪费的问题。他们探究到底是什么原因造成过去对野生植物没有充分利用？商业部门主要原因是没有从生产观点出发，在经营上存在着怕麻烦、怕积压浪费、怕赔钱等保守思想；工业部门则认为加工技术有困难，对利用和使用存在着疑虑，没有完全结合本省特点和实际情况去解决人民的吃、穿和用的问题。辩论中，大家一致认为现在是充分利用野生植物的时候了。他们总结了两年来各地利用野生植物的经验。例如，处在川北山区的北川县，以往当地每年消费的八十万斤酒中，因高粱、玉米等酿酒原料不足，每年有一半要靠外地供应；去年他们利用蕨苕、葛根等野生淀粉酿酒成功，当年就从缺酒变为自足。今年全县新添了二十个酿坊，已全部用代用品酿酒，产量将达二百万斤，除了本县食用外，还可外调一百二十万斤。重庆市工业局实验所从去年9月以来，在全省三十多个县收集了一百多种野生纤维，已证明有二十种可以纺纱织布。其中除棉秆皮、夹竹桃、水麻等五种纤维已经用机纺、机织成功外，其余桑树皮、构树皮等十种野生纤维也已和棉花混合，用手工纺织成功。重庆市纺织工业过去因原料不足，对增产棉布感到困难，现在因利用野生纤维成功，他们要求省供销部门今年能供应七千吨人造棉原料。这样，重庆纺织工业吃不饱的局面就可以改变了。
    但是，有人也还有各种顾虑：野生植物原料能够长期供应吗？产品的质量能够合乎要求吗？消费者愿意使用吗？其实，这种顾虑是多余的。四川省服务部门在广元、北川、旺苍、通江等地调查，当地野生淀粉资源，按二十年为周期更始循环，永远不会枯竭，而每年的利用量，除本县自给以外，都有一半甚至一半以上的富余。只要在采集野生纤维、油料的时候，不斩草除根，也是可以用之不竭的，一些品种如蓑草、粉葛根等还可以进行人工培育，以适应需要。至于利用野生植物制造的产品质量，只要技术处理恰当，不仅可以达到一般产品质量要求，还可以制造高级产品。重庆沙市、裕华两个纺织厂分别利用水麻和大麻混纺成二十一、二十二、二十三支细纱，制成各种颜色的印花被面、毛巾毯、枕巾和各种花袜等二十多个品种，染色、光泽和拉力都比纯棉纱织品的好。西南第一丝厂把野生取麻纺成了八十支高级细纱，质量、光泽超过苎麻，现在重庆纺织工业公司已把它织成色彩鲜艳的夹丝呢。用橡籽酿造饮料酒，色、香、味都与高粱酒相似，一般饮者反映其品质较糖蜜饮料酒为佳。在全国第一次酿酒会议上橡籽酒已被评为甲等酒类。成都、万县等地用红根和橡碗制成的烤胶，可以跟进口烤胶媲美，价格比进口货却便宜三分之一左右。这种新兴事业的光辉成就，使许多具有保守思想的人打开了眼界，逼迫他们不得不在思想上、行动上来个大革命。
    从四川各地来看，现在各有关部门职工已拿出百倍革命干劲，重整旗鼓继续向野生植物进军。四川省供销合作社在贯彻“大收大卖，充分扩大利用”的方针下，今年计划收购的野生植物一般要比去年增加十倍左右。其中增长得最快的是野生淀粉，计划收购量达六百万担，比去年增加三百倍；野生油脂收购三十四万担，比去年增加六十一倍。全省要求今年保证完成总值三亿六千万元的采购任务。南充、万县、涪陵等专区的基层供销社干部表示，要“攻破荒山、打开宝库”，在全省掀起一个“向深山要酒、要糖、要油、要粉；向老林要纸、要麻、要胶”的高潮。
    全省成百成千个大型和小型的野生植物加工厂也已纷纷着手建立。现在全国第一座野生纤维加工厂已经在三台建成并正式投入生产，每天生产野生纤维成品三百斤。成都市今年计划筹建的四座以野生植物作原料的烤胶糠醛厂、香料油厂、黄纸板厂、野生纤维脱胶厂中，有两个厂已经动工，今年就可投入生产。奉节县也正在筹建小型野生植物加工厂四十二个。四川省供销合作社将陆续在遂宁、达县、万县、南充、温江等专区兴建日产人造棉六十担的大型加工厂八个、日产三十担的小型加工厂三十个；另外还要在山区兴建简易加工厂。这些工厂投资都很少，大厂不过四、五万元，小厂二、三千元，大部分年内就可投入生产。建立这些工厂需要的技术力量也正在培训中，成都、万县、三台等三地已开了野生纤维加工训练班，有一千多人在这里学会了纤维脱胶、加工技术。重庆、成都两地工业部门正在集中力量解决各种野生植物大规模纺织的工艺技术问题，以扩大资源的利用。最近，为了适应这一新的生产特点，全省工业、商业部门已提出了“三上山”的新口号：一、要商业网上山，力争农民“买货不出门，卖货不出村”，把农村出产的东西及时收购起来；二、技术上山，通过宣传、展览、开办训练班分批地帮助农业社训练技术员等办法，充分发掘深山老林中的宝草；三、加工厂上山，把原料的产地变成加工的基地，哪里有原料，就把工厂搬到哪里，并尽力综合利用原料，例如有的野生植物就可以酿酒、熬糖和作饲料。目前，这种蓬勃的生产热潮，已给工业、手工业、商业工作带来了巨大的冲击力量，而这些部门的努力改进，又是促进工农业发展的关键。
    从目前发展趋势看，四川省利用野生植物将成为一个广泛的群众性运动。只要冲破一切保守思想、陈旧观念，充分认识到这一新兴事业的重要意义，加强工业、农业、商业、科学研究机构的配合协作和互相支援，四川整个地方工业必将出现一个新的局面。
