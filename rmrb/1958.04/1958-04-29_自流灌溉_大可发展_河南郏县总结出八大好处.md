Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 27th: Many places in Henan Province are utilizing all possible water sources, adapting to local conditions, and vigorously developing gravity irrigation. According to incomplete statistics, there are now more than 24,100 discovered free-flowing springs in the province, with a diversion flow of 201 cubic meters per second. A survey of only five special districts—Xinxiang, Xuchang, Nanyang, Xinyang, and Kaifeng—shows that gravity irrigation covers an area of more than 26.6 million mu. Nanyang, Jia County, and Xinye counties, which have made faster progress, have basically achieved gravity irrigation for the vast majority of their farmland. In Shuimohe Township, Changge County, relying on the masses to find and report springs, a large spring was discovered with a diversion flow of 1.5 cubic meters per second, capable of irrigating 50,000 mu of land. Now, this county has converted 200,000 mu of land, which was previously irrigated using water-lifting tools, into gravity irrigation, saving a large amount of labor and water-lifting equipment.

Many places with well-developed gravity irrigation have also developed a method of combining water storage and irrigation into a gravity irrigation network. Nanyang County, with the Bai River as its center, has dug a channel network more than 1,000 li long, including six large channels and more than 300 small channels. This network is connected to nearly 6,000 water storage projects, such as large, medium, and small reservoirs and ponds throughout the county, enabling gravity irrigation for all 1.49 million mu of land in the county, of which 500,000 mu can be converted into paddy fields. Because the county's rivers, reservoirs, ponds, and water pits are interconnected, water volume can be better regulated, enhancing water storage and flood prevention capabilities.

According to the Jia County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gravity irrigation has eight major benefits: First, it can save a large amount of labor. The 510,000 mu of land in this county that has achieved gravity irrigation saves 10.8 million workdays per year, calculated on the basis of watering four times a year, compared to the past when water-lifting tools were used for irrigation. Second, with the development of gravity irrigation, the county can save more than 16,660 waterwheels, saving farmers 2 million yuan in funds for purchasing water-lifting tools. Third, irrigation is even and thorough, and can better ensure timely sowing. Fourth, free-flowing water, after being exposed to the sun, can increase the fertility of the water, which can better help crops grow than using well water. Fifth, developing gravity irrigation and storing water everywhere can raise the groundwater level and increase soil moisture content. Sixth, it can regulate the climate and greatly develop aquaculture. Seventh, it creates conditions for further development of hydropower generation. Eighth, it is convenient for farmers to obtain drinking water, water for daily use, and water for livestock.

    自流灌溉　大可发展
    河南郏县总结出八大好处
    据新华社郑州27日电　河南省许多地方利用一切可能的水源，因势利导，大力发展自流灌溉。据不完全统计，现在全省挖出的自流泉共有二万四千一百多处，引水量二百零一秒公方。仅新乡、许昌、南阳、信阳、开封等五个专区调查，自流灌溉面积就达到二千六百六十多万亩。进展较快的南阳、郏县和新野等县，绝大多数农田基本上都实现了自流灌溉。长葛县水磨河乡依靠群众找泉、报泉，挖出的一个大泉引水量有一点五秒公方，能灌溉五万亩土地。现在这个县已经使过去用提水工具灌溉的二十万亩地变成了自流灌溉，节省了大量的劳力和提水工具。
    许多自流灌溉搞得较好的地方，还发展了蓄水、灌溉相结合的自流灌溉网的办法。南阳县以白河为中心，挖成了长达一千多华里包括六条大渠和三百多条小渠的渠道网，这个网同全县大、中、小型水库和坑塘等近六千处蓄水工程相通，使全县一百四十九万亩土地都能实行自流灌溉，其中五十万亩土地还能够改成稻田。由于全县河流、水库、池塘、水坑都能相互贯通，能更好地调节水量，增强了蓄水和防涝的能力。
    据中共郏县县委总结，自流灌溉有八大好处：一、可以节省大量的劳动力，这个县已经实现自流灌溉的五十一万亩土地，按一年浇四次水计算，比过去用提水工具灌溉要节省一千零八十万个劳动日；二、发展了自流灌溉，全县就能节省水车一万六千六百六十多部，为农民节约购置提水工具的资金二百万元；三、灌溉均匀、深透，而且能够更好保证适时播种；四、自流水经过日晒，可以增加水的肥力，比用井水能更好地帮助禾苗生长；五、发展自流灌溉，到处蓄水，能够提高地下水位，增加土壤的含水率；六、可以调剂气候，并且能大量发展水产；七、为进一步发展水力发电创造条件；八、农民吃水用水牲畜饮水都很方便。
