Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 17th: Indonesian military authorities and government officials have unanimously condemned a United Press International (UPI) dispatch from Washington containing divisive rumors about discord between Army Chief of Staff Nasution and President Sukarno.

Lieutenant Colonel Piengaadi, an Indonesian Army spokesman, told reporters on the evening of the 16th that the purpose of UPI in spreading such news was to sow discord between the leaders of the Indonesian government and the army, and to launch a war of nerves at a time when Indonesia is resolving its internal problems.

Antara News Agency quoted Foreign Ministry sources as saying that there were no differences of opinion between the President and the Army Chief of Staff, and they found the motives behind the US sending this news to be perplexing.

"Merdeka" newspaper said today that UPI's news and the intentions of the US State Department cannot be separated. The newspaper said that because the US State Department saw that the rebels it sympathized with were suffering defeats and felt worried, and because it may have taken into account various consequences and did not openly assist the rebels, it attempted to shift the battle line from Padang-Bukittinggi to Jakarta, that is, to spread prejudice and suspicion against the Indonesian central government, thereby provoking the relationship between the leaders of the Indonesian nation and the army.

    印度尼西亚军政人士
    驳斥美宣传机器挑拨离间
    据新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚军事当局和政府人士一致斥责合众社自华盛顿发出的一条关于陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安和总统苏加诺之间有矛盾的挑拨离间消息。
    印度尼西亚陆军发言人皮恩加迪中校16日晚上对新闻记者说，合众社散发这种消息的目的是要在印度尼西亚政府和陆军的领袖之间进行挑拨离间，并且是要在印度尼西亚正在解决国内问题的时候发动神经战。
    安塔拉通讯社引用外交部人士的话说，总统和陆军参谋长之间并无意见分歧，他们觉得美国发出这条消息的居心使人不解。
    “独立报”今天说，合众社的消息和美国国务院的意图是不能分开的。这家报纸说，由于美国国务院看到了它所同情的叛军遭到失败而感到担忧，它可能考虑到种种后果而不公开援助叛乱分子，它就企图把战线从巴东—武吉丁宜转移到雅加达，即对印度尼西亚中央政府散布偏见和怀疑，从而挑拨印度尼西亚国家和军队的领袖的关系。
