Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 28th: Shanghai's various circles of democratic personages are launching ideological criticism with the focus on discrediting bourgeois individualism. These discussion meetings were organized by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) starting in the second half of April, based on requests from various parties. More than two hundred people participated, including members of the Shanghai Municipal CPPCC, heads of Shanghai municipal organizations of various democratic parties, and people from all walks of life.

At the panel meetings attended by industrialists and businessmen such as Sheng Pihua, Rong Yiren, Hu Juewen, and Guo Linshuang, discussions were very lively. Everyone believed that bourgeois individualism was a major stronghold in industrial and commercial circles, and that the harmfulness of bourgeois individualism was particularly great, so it must be publicly and thoroughly discredited. Many people, from aspects such as joint state-private ownership, purchasing public bonds, and participating in government work, self-exposed the dirty thoughts of personal fame and gain deep in their hearts. Most of the upper-level figures in industrial and commercial circles who spoke at the meeting initially analyzed their own enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction. They believed that although they had done some things beneficial to the people under the leadership of the Communist Party in recent years, their enthusiasm was basically in situations where national interests and personal interests did not conflict or when compelled by the general trend. This was still far from the working class's selfless revolutionary enthusiasm. To truly give their hearts to the people and to the cause of socialist construction, to muster genuine enthusiasm, and to strive for advancement, they still needed a high degree of consciousness and to thoroughly discredit bourgeois individualism.

Democratic personages in the fields of literature, art, education, science, and technology, such as Xiong Foxi, Lu Yudao, and Wu Ruo'an, believed in group discussions that the evil bourgeois individualism was the most serious obstacle to the current great leap forward in cultural and scientific undertakings. They exposed many manifestations of bourgeois individualism in themselves and others, such as advocating "individual freedom," "looking down on the power of the masses," "art for art's sake," and "science for science's sake." The speakers all expressed that, no matter how stubbornly and cleverly bourgeois individualism manifested itself through various hidden forms, everyone was determined to rely on collective strength to dig it out.

    任凭个人主义顽强　定要把它彻底搞臭
    上海各界民主人士展开思想批判
    据新华社上海28日电　上海市各界民主人士正以搞臭资产阶级个人主义为中心展开思想批判。这种讨论会是政协上海市委员会根据各方面的要求，从4月下半月开始组织的。参加的有上海市政协委员、各民主党派上海市组织负责人和各界人士两百多人。
    在盛丕华、荣毅仁、胡厥文、郭琳爽等工商界人士参加的小组会上，讨论很热烈。大家认为资产阶级个人主义在工商界是个大本营，资产阶级个人主义的危害性特别大，必须把它公开地、彻底地搞臭。很多人从公私合营、购买公债和参加政府工作等方面，自我揭发了心灵深处的个人名利等肮脏思想。在会上发言的大多数工商界上层人士都初步分析了自己参加社会主义建设的干劲到底怎样，大家认为，几年来他们虽然在共产党领导下，做了一些有益于人民的事，但基本上是在国家利益和个人利益没有起冲突或迫于大势的情况下的干劲，这同工人阶级大公无私的革命干劲还差得很远；要真正把心交给人民，交给社会主义建设事业，鼓起真正的干劲，力争上游，还需要高度自觉，狠狠地搞臭资产阶级个人主义。
    文艺、教育、科技等方面的民主人士熊佛西、卢于道、吴若安等人在小组漫谈中认为，万恶的资产阶级个人主义是当前文化事业和科学事业大跃进的最严重的阻力。他们揭发了自己和别人有关资产阶级个人主义的许多表现，如主张“个人自由”、“看不起群众的力量”、“为文学而文学”、“为科学而科学”。发言者都表示，任凭资产阶级个人主义顽强、巧妙地通过种种隐蔽形式表现出来，大家还是有决心依靠集体力量，把它挖掘出来。
