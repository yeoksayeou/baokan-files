    Beijing Electric Power School
    Successfully Trial-Produces Longitudinal Bending Testing Machine

    The metalworking practice factory of Beijing Electric Power School recently successfully trial-produced a longitudinal bending testing machine. After testing, it proved to be effective and has been accepted by the school. It has now been delivered to the school's laboratory for use.

    This longitudinal bending testing machine has a simple structure, small size, low cost, manual operation, and is easy to use. It is very suitable for material mechanics experiments in secondary technical schools. Beijing Electric Power School plans to produce it in large quantities this year to supply brother schools. Currently, order procedures have begun.

    The successful trial production of the longitudinal bending testing machine fully demonstrates that the school is capable of manufacturing its own teaching equipment and conducting production, opening up avenues for running the school diligently and thriftily. (Yuan Lin)

    北京电力学校
    试制纵弯曲试验机成功
    北京电力学校金工实习工厂最近试制纵弯曲试验机成功，经过试验证明效果良好，已经学校验收。现已交学校试验室使用。
    这种纵弯曲试验机构造简单，体积不大，成本不高，手工操作，使用方便，很适于中等技术学校材料力学试验用。北京电力学校拟于今年大批生产，以供应兄弟学校使用。目前，已开始办理订货手续。
    纵弯曲试验机试制成功，充分证明了学校能够自制教学设备和进行生产，为勤俭办校开辟了途径。（袁林）
