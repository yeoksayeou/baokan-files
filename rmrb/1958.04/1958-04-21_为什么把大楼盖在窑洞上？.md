    Why Build a Building on Top of Cave Dwellings?
    The staff dormitory building of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau's Machinery Supply Station, built in the eastern suburbs of Xi'an, was constructed in 1956. Before construction, during a survey for ancient tombs, it was discovered that there were cave dwellings and tunnels deep under two of the units. At the time, the construction负责人 in charge of the site suggested to the Northwest Industrial Design Institute that these two units should not be built. However, the engineer in charge of designing the building project believed there was no problem and said that the cave dwellings and tunnels were nine meters below the surface and could be built on after backfilling with soil. The construction unit then followed the engineer's advice and continued construction. In the spring of 1957, shortly after the building was completed, the foundations of the two units built on top of the cave dwellings gradually sank, the walls cracked, and the doors and windows were deformed. In February of this year, to prevent collapse, these two units were finally demolished.
    The construction and demolition resulted in losses of more than 100,000 yuan. To date, no relevant authorities have dealt with this matter. I hope that it will not be simply demolished and forgotten. The responsibility should be investigated, and lessons should be learned.

    为什么把大楼盖在窑洞上？
    西北工程管理总局机械供应站在西安市东郊建筑的职工宿舍大楼，是1956年兴建的，施工前在进行古墓钻探时，发觉有两个单元的深处有窑洞和隧道。当时工地施工负责人曾向西北工业设计院提议不要盖这两个单元；可是负责设计大楼工程的工程师却认为没问题，并说：窑洞和隧道在九公尺下层，回土填实即可施工。施工单位即按照工程师的意见，继续施工了。1957年春天大楼竣工后不久，果然建筑在窑洞上面的两个单元基础逐渐下沉，墙面裂缝，门窗变形。今年2月，为了防止倒塌，终于把这两个单元拆除了。
    一盖一拆，造成的损失达十多万元。到目前为止，尚未见有关机关处理这件事。我希望不要拆完了事，应该查清责任，接受教训。
