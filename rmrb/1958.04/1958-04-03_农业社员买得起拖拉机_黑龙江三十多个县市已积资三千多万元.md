Agricultural Cooperative Members Can Afford Tractors
More Than 30 Counties and Cities in Heilongjiang Have Accumulated Over 30 Million Yuan

(Reported by this newspaper) In Heilongjiang, agricultural cooperatives have used public accumulation and voluntary contributions from members to gather a considerable amount of funds for mechanization. According to statistics from 31 cities and counties, the funds raised by agricultural cooperatives to purchase tractors and agricultural machinery have reached over 37 million yuan. Hunchun, which established the earliest tractor station, has already collected 1.92 million yuan. Farmers in Gongsheng Township, who have benefited from mechanization in recent years, upon hearing that agricultural cooperatives could purchase tractors, raised 110,000 yuan within a few days through member contributions and cooperative public accumulation. Currently, agricultural cooperatives are intensifying their preparations for spring plowing to ensure a great leap forward in production this year, in order to increase income and public accumulation. Nehe County has calculated that if all 167 agricultural cooperatives in the county contribute 3% to 5% of their public accumulation, plus deposits from credit cooperatives and partial state loans, they can purchase enough agricultural machinery to meet the county's needs for agricultural mechanization within two years.

While enthusiastically raising funds, various localities have begun planning and training the large number of drivers, farm implement operators, and repair workers needed to realize agricultural mechanization. According to the plan of the Mudanjiang Special District, by 1960, it will be possible to train 5,000 people who have mastered mechanized farming, meeting the needs of the entire special district. The common method adopted in various localities is to have existing state-owned farms, state-owned mechanical tractor stations, agricultural cooperatives with tractors, and tractor repair factories use apprenticeship or on-the-spot training classes, combining labor and training, and integrating lectures with practical operations. Baiquan County, which pioneered the experience of agricultural cooperatives owning and operating their own tractors, has selected 600 rural educated youths from various agricultural cooperatives to study at more than 30 agricultural cooperatives with self-operated tractors, in order to meet the technical needs of the 109 cooperatives that will achieve mechanization this year. According to a survey of 31 counties, more than 3,000 demobilized soldiers who have driven tanks and cars can operate agricultural machinery with a little training. By adopting these methods, without the state spending money, all the technical personnel needed for agricultural mechanization in the province can be trained in a few years. (Shao Yongli)

    农业社员买得起拖拉机
    黑龙江三十多个县市已积资三千多万元
    本报讯　黑龙江各地农业社用公共积累和社员自愿集资，汇集了数量可观的机械化资金。据三十一个市县的统计，现在农业社筹集起来准备购买拖拉机和农机具的资金，已达三千七百多万元。最早建立拖拉机站的桦川，已集资一百九十二万元。几年来得到机械化好处的公胜乡农民，听说农业社可以购买拖拉机，在几天内社员集资加上合作社公共积累就凑起来十一万元。现在，各农业社正加紧做好春耕准备，确保今年生产大跃进，以便增加收入，增加公共积累，讷河县算了一笔细账：全县一百六十七个农业社只要把公共积累拿出3％到5％，再加上信用社的存款和国家部分贷款，在两年内就能买够全县农业机械化所需要的机器。
    各地在踊跃筹集资金的同时，开始规划和培训实现农业机械化需要的大量驾驶员、农具手和修理工人。据牡丹江专区的规划，到1960年就可以培养出满足全专区需要的五千名掌握机械化耕作的人才。各地普遍采取的方法是由现有国营农场、国营机械拖拉机站和有拖拉机的农业社、拖拉机检修厂用带徒弟或就地开办训练班，边劳动边训练，讲课和操作相结合。首创农业社自有自营拖拉机经验的拜泉县，已从各农业社选拔了六百名农村知识青年，到三十几个自营拖拉机的农业社去学习，以满足今年一百零九个社实现机械化所需要的技术力量。另据三十一个县的调查，曾经驾驶过坦克、汽车的三千多名复员军人，稍加训练就可以操纵农业机器。采用以上这些方法，不用国家出钱，在几年内就可以培养起来全省农业机械化所需要的全部技术人才。　（邵永力）
