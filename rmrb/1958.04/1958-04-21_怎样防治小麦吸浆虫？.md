How to Prevent and Control Wheat Blossom Midge?
    Mai Chong Zu, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

    Wheat blossom midge (including red wheat blossom midge and yellow wheat blossom midge; the former occurs in plains, especially irrigated areas, and the latter is distributed in mountainous and plateau areas) occurs in all major wheat-producing areas in China. The Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) lists it as one of the eight pests to be eliminated. The main areas in China affected by blossom midge are Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces. It also causes damage in southern Hebei, western Inner Mongolia, and parts of Sichuan. The blossom midge overwinters as a cocooned larva in the soil three to four inches deep. Adults emerge in late April (in Gansu, from late May to early June). At this time, wheat is just heading, and the larvae invade and damage the ovaries, sucking the sap. The larvae develop inside the wheat grain, and before the wheat matures, they fall into the soil to lie dormant, overwintering and oversummering. The methods for preventing and controlling wheat blossom midge are roughly as follows:

    Chemical Soil Treatment: This is a comprehensive method for controlling wheat pests. In addition to eliminating blossom midge, it can also control underground pests during the seedling stage, such as wireworms, grubs, and mole crickets, and can also reduce damage from wheat stem flies. In winter wheat areas, apply three to four catties of 6% BHC powder per mu during autumn plowing, or in spring wheat, miscellaneous grain, and oil crop areas during spring plowing. If applied after winter wheat turns green, two to three catties can be used. Mix with soil and spread during hoeing, hoeing it into the soil. If irrigation is possible after application, the effect will be better.

    Chemical Soil Surface Application: When the blossom midge begins to pupate, use a powder duster to sprinkle BHC powder along the wheat ridges, which can kill the pupae and inhibit adult emergence. During the peak pupation period, use three catties of 1.5% BHC powder or half a catty to one catty of 6% BHC powder (mixed with three catties of fine soil) per mu. After late-stage pupae (pupal wings have turned black) appear, use three to four catties of 0.5% BHC powder. This method is very effective. In some areas where it often rains during the heading period (such as the Huai River basin), where the soil moisture is high and it is difficult to apply pesticides, or in areas with a shortage of labor, this method is suitable.

    Chemical Control of Adults: When it is discovered that adults have emerged, immediately spray 0.25% BHC powder on the wheat ridges (mix one part of 0.5% BHC powder with one part of fine soil). The time for application is best at noon or in the early morning or evening (do not apply when there is heavy dew in the early morning or evening), and the effect is better when the blossom midge is hiding in the lower part of the wheat plants. The advantage of this method is that it saves money, but the disadvantage is that it is labor-intensive. This method can be used in areas with economic difficulties and low pest density. However, attention must be paid to the pest situation, and application should be carried out during the peak period of occurrence to eliminate them before laying eggs, otherwise wheat production will be reduced.

    Planting Pest-Resistant Varieties: In areas severely affected by blossom midge, Xi Nong 6028 wheat can be cultivated. According to current understanding, Xi Nong 6028 is suitable for northern Henan, Guanzhong in Shaanxi, southern Shanxi, and other areas. In the Huai River basin, Hanzhong, Hubei, and other areas, it is best to cultivate Nan Da 2419. In addition, Zhu Gan Qing in northern Henan can also reduce the damage from blossom midge.

    怎样防治小麦吸浆虫？
    中国农业科学院植物保护研究所麦虫组
    小麦吸浆虫（包括麦红吸浆虫及麦黄吸浆虫，前者发生于平原特别是灌溉地，后者分布于山区及高原区。）在全国主要产麦区均有发生，农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定它为八大消灭对象之一。吸浆虫在我国为害的主要地区是河南、陕西、山西、湖北、安徽、江苏、甘肃、青海等省；在河北南部、内蒙古西部、四川一部分地区也有为害。吸浆虫以结茧幼虫在土中三、四寸之处越冬，4月下旬（在甘肃为5月下旬至6月上旬）羽化为成虫。此时小麦刚抽穗，幼虫即侵入为害子房，吸食浆液。幼虫在麦粒内发育，至麦熟前落土中潜伏，越夏越冬。防治小麦吸浆虫的方法大致有以下几种：
    药剂土壤处理：这是综合防治小麦害虫的一种方法，除可消灭吸浆虫之外，还可治苗期地下害虫，如金针虫、蛴螬、蝼蛄等，也可以减少麦秆蝇等为害。冬麦区秋耕或春麦、杂粮、油料区春耕，每亩可用6％六六六粉剂三至四斤，如在冬麦回青以后施用则可用二至三斤，在锄麦时兑土撒下，锄入土中。施药以后如能灌水，效果会更好。
    药剂土面施药：当吸浆虫开始化蛹时，用喷粉器沿麦垅地面撒六六六粉，就可以杀蛹并抑制成虫羽化。在蛹盛期每亩可用1.5％的六六六粉三斤或6％六六六粉半斤至一斤（可兑细土三斤撒下），后期蛹（蛹翅已变黑）出现以后，可用0.5％六六六粉三至四斤。这种方法效果很好。在一些抽穗期常下雨的地区（如淮河流域），因土壤湿度大而不易下地施药，或劳动力缺乏的地区，以应用这种方法为合适。
    药剂杀灭成虫办法：当检查发现成虫已经羽化，立即用0.25％六六六粉喷于麦垅中（以0.5％六六六粉一份、细土一份兑成）。撒药时间以午间或早晚间为宜（早晚间露水大时则不要撒药），吸浆虫潜伏在麦株下部的时候效果更佳。此法优点是省钱，缺点是费工。在经济较困难而害虫密度不大的地区可用此法。但必须注意虫情，掌握在盛发期施药，消灭在产卵以前，否则麦子就会减产。
    种抗虫的品种：吸浆虫严重地区可栽培西农6028小麦，据目前了解，西农6028适宜地区为豫北、陕西关中、晋南等地；淮河流域地区和汉中、湖北等地，则以栽培南大2419为好。此外，如豫北的竹秆青等也可减轻吸浆虫为害。
