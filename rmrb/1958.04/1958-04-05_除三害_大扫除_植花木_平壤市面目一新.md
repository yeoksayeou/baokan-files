Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd—The residents of Pyongyang are launching a mass movement for spring sanitation and city beautification. Since March 26, when the mass movement, including road repairs, planting flowers and trees, eliminating the three pests (flies, mosquitoes, and rats), and general cleaning, encompassing fifteen items, began, Pyongyang has taken on a new look.

Currently, streets and alleys, front and back of houses in Pyongyang are filled with working people. According to statistics, more than 40,000 Pyongyang residents participate in this movement every day; women are the main force in this movement.

In the first five days of the movement, Pyongyang residents have planted 400,000 trees, repaired 120,000 square meters of roads, repaired more than 20,000 square meters of flowerbeds, dug out 25 tons of fly pupae, killed more than 7,000 rats, filled in more than 10,000 square meters of sewage pools, and also cleared thousands of tons of mud and garbage, cleaned up and dismantled ruins and air-raid shelters left over from the war. This movement was launched based on a decision made by the Pyongyang People's Committee on March 21. In order to make Pyongyang a beautiful and modern city, it was decided to designate April and October of each year as the spring and autumn "Sanitation and Beautification Months." During these two months, citywide mass sanitation and beautification movements will be launched. According to this decision, Pyongyang plans to plant more than 1.2 million trees, repair more than 200,000 square meters of flowerbeds, and repair more than 500,000 square meters of roads this spring. In addition, it will also expand the upper and lower water pipeline network and open several new parks. After completing these tasks, the heroic city of Pyongyang will become more orderly and beautiful.

Like Pyongyang, the cities of Nampo, Chongjin, and Kaesong in northern Korea have also launched sanitation and beautification movements.

    除三害　大扫除　植花木
    平壤市面目一新
    新华社平壤3日电　平壤市居民正在展开一个春季卫生和美化城市的群众运动。自从3月26日开始了这个包括修道路、植花木、除三害（蝇、蚊和老鼠）、大扫除等十五项内容的群众运动以来，平壤市已经面貌一新。
    目前，平壤市的大街小巷、门前房后到处都是劳动的人群。据统计，每天参加这个运动的平壤市居民有四万多人；妇女是这个运动中的主力军。
    在运动开始的头五天中，平壤市居民已经植树四十万株，修路十二万平方公尺，修花圃两万多平方公尺，挖出二十五吨蝇蛹，打死七千多只老鼠，填平污水池一万多平方公尺，此外，还清除了几千吨泥土和垃圾，清理和拆除了战争时期遗留下来的废墟和防空洞。这个运动是根据3月21日平壤市人民委员会的一项决定开展起来的。为了使平壤市成为美丽的现代化城市，决定规定每年4月和10月为春季和秋季“卫生美化月”。在这两个月中，全市要展开群众性的卫生美化运动。根据这项决定，平壤市在今年春季要植树一百二十多万株，修花圃二十多万平方公尺，整修道路五十多万平方公尺，另外，还要扩大上下水道网，开辟几个新公园。在完成这些工作以后，英雄的平壤市将变得更加整齐而美丽。
    像平壤市一样，朝鲜北部的南浦、清津、开城等城市也都展开了卫生美化运动。
