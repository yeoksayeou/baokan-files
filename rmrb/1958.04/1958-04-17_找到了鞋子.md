    Found the Shoe
    Mother went to the shoe shop to pick up the shoes that had been soled. When she got home and opened the shoe bag, there was only one shoe left. She didn't know when she had lost the other one.
    Looking at the remaining shoe, I felt very sorry. The material was a minor issue, but Mother had spent more than ten days rushing to make them. If she had to make another pair, how many more nights would Mother have to stay up! Should I look for it? But where could I look?
    The next afternoon, I met a traffic police officer at the intersection. I asked him casually, "Comrade Police, I lost a shoe. Have you seen it?" This police officer told me that someone had found the shoe and told me to go to the Traffic Team on Zhonghua North Road to claim it.
    After work, I went to the place the police officer had told me to go. In the Traffic Team's office, I saw the same comrade again. He asked me kindly, "You're here?" Then he opened the cabinet, and I immediately saw my beloved shoe. When the police officer handed the shoe to me, I couldn't think of anything to say except, "Thank you for your trouble..."

    找到了鞋子
    母亲到鞋铺取回绱好的鞋子，到家打开鞋包一看，只剩了一只，不知什么时候把那只丢了。
    眼看着剩下的一只鞋，心里很可惜，费了布料小事，母亲花了十来天时间赶做的。要再做一双，母亲又该熬多少个夜晚呢！要找吧，上那儿去找呢！
    第二天下午，在十字街遇见一位交通警察，我顺便问他：“警察同志，我丢了一只鞋子，不知你见到没有？”这位警察同志告诉我，有人拾到这只鞋子，要我去中华北路交通队去领。
    下班后，我就按照这位警察同志所说的地方去领，在交通队的办公室里，我又看到了这位同志，他和和气气地问：你来啦？接着就打开柜子，我一眼便看到了心爱的鞋子，当警察同志把鞋子递到我手里时，一时想不起说什么好，只是重复着：费心了，谢谢你……。
