Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th: Leaders of local China Democratic National Construction Association (民建) and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (工商联) organizations from eight cities, including Beijing, and seven provinces and autonomous regions, including Shanxi, signed an agreement in Tianjin on the 17th, representing local industrialists and businessmen, to launch a socialist self-remolding competition among industrialists and businessmen.

This agreement was signed after exchanging experiences at an on-site conference on self-remolding experiences of industrialists and businessmen held in Tianjin by the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Rectification Work Committee.

The agreement stipulates five areas of competition: First, compete in heart-to-heart talks—speaking heart-to-heart to the Party, breaking with capitalism and establishing socialism. Compete to see who speaks quickly, thoroughly, deeply, and sincerely; compete to see who analyzes and criticizes well. Second, compete in planning—formulating, revising, and implementing plans. Compete to see who can grasp their own root causes and change them severely; compete to see who can set high targets with double measures and implement them with triple effort. The other three items are competing in labor, competing in contribution, and competing in learning. They also use this as a condition to advocate a new upsurge of self-remolding among industrialists and businessmen across the country.

The conference held in Tianjin focused on introducing the experience of the Tianjin business community in the heart-to-heart movement and the experience of the Shanghai business community in formulating transformation plans. These two experiences were created by the masses of the business community in the two cities under the new situation of self-remolding.

This experience exchange meeting started on the 14th and ended on the evening of the 17th. Representatives from local China Democratic League and All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce organizations from six provinces (Shandong, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, Heilongjiang), Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and eight cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing) attended the meeting.

    比交心　比规划　比劳动　比贡献　比学习
    工商业者都来竞赛自我改造
    十五个省市民建和工商联负责人在天津签订协议书
    据新华社天津17日电　北京等八个市和山西等七个省、自治区的民建会、工商联地方组织负责人，代表本地的工商业者，17日在天津签订协议书，决定开展工商业者的社会主义自我改造竞赛。
    这个协议书，是在民建中央和全国工商联整风工作委员会在天津市召开的工商业者自我改造经验交流现场会议上，经过交流经验以后签订的。
    协议订出竞赛的内容有五比：第一，比交心——向党交心，破资本主义，立社会主义。比谁交得快、透、深、真；比谁分析、批判得好。第二，比规划——订立、修订和执行规划。比谁能抓住自己的病根，狠狠的改；比谁能订出十分指标，十二分措施，以二十四分干劲来贯彻执行。另外的三项是比劳动、比贡献、比学习。他们并以此作为条件，向全国各地工商业者倡议掀起自我改造的新的热潮。
    在天津召开的这个会议，着重介绍了天津工商界交心运动和上海工商界制定改造规划的经验。这两个经验是两市工商界群众在自我改造的新形势下创造出来的。
    这次经验交流会是从14日开始的，17日晚上结束。参加会议的，有山东、山西、辽宁、吉林、河北、黑龙江六省、内蒙古自治区和北京、上海、天津、沈阳、西安、武汉、广州、重庆八个市的民建会、工商联地方组织的代表。
