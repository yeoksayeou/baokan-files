Learning from Mu Guiying
Zhou Cheng

On Sunday, I went to dig earth outside Jianguomen in Beijing, where the future Dongfeng Lake will be. I saw many female comrades competing with each other, choosing the heavy work to do. With heavy burdens on their shoulders, they walked with vigorous strides, truly no less capable than strong young men. No wonder the announcer, while praising heroes in the style of Wu Song, constantly mentioned this and that female comrade: "Working really hard, better than Mu Guiying." Moreover, the Mu Guiyings themselves constantly challenged and responded, also challenging and responding to the Wu Songs. One female comrade went up to the loudspeaker to express the sentiments of the dozen or so embroidery workers in their sewing cooperative, wanting to compete with the heroes of the entire construction site in terms of enthusiasm. The conditions included loading more, running faster, and also improving tools to achieve results with less effort, and so on. This heroic spirit shook every heart. They, who usually just sit in a room, holding needles and threading them, using their delicate hands and meticulous skills. Who would have thought that once they came to this vast world of construction, they would suddenly have boundless strength, infinite courage, and wisdom surpassing the heavens. This truly makes some pale-faced scholars feel ashamed. I felt a surge of heat all over my body and instantly generated a great strength that even surprised myself, throwing myself into the labor with fiery enthusiasm.

Construction sites like this, numbering in the thousands across the country, how many Mu Guiyings will emerge? In fact, it is not only on these construction sites, but also in villages, farms, factories, schools, and government offices, they are everywhere. On April 20th, Premier Zhou visited the Guanhutun Agricultural Cooperative in Yanzhuang Township, a suburb of Zhengzhou City, and said: "Good, the elderly and women here can all work, truly the elderly are better than old Huang Zhong, and women are better than Mu Guiying." (See the People's Daily report on April 24th.) In today's China, women, regardless of the nature of the work or their age, almost all take Mu Guiying as their role model. Even Liu Wenqing, a 69-year-old housewife in Xuanwu District, Beijing, challenged all the housewives in the city, saying: "The people across the country are making great leaps forward, and we housewives will never lag behind, we must surpass Mu Guiying in Chinese history." (See the Beijing Daily report on March 6th.)

Let's not rush to examine whether there really was a Mu Guiying in Chinese history, because everyone already knows that in the legends of the Yang family generals, from breaking the Heavenly Gate Formation onwards, Mu Guiying has always been a prominent figure in the battles between the Song and Liao dynasties. The Heavenly Gate Formation was a fierce and extremely strong fortress set up by a high-level expert hired by the Liao Dynasty. All the generals and leaders of the Song camp gathered, everyone was worried, everyone was helpless, who dared to attack, who dared to break it. Unexpectedly, little Mu Guiying actually stated: "Since childhood, I have studied martial arts and have a deep understanding of military strategy, even if there are thousands of formations, I can kill my way through." The development of the story proves that she was not just rashly boasting out of desperation to save Yang Zongbao, nor was she arbitrarily talking big without knowing her own limitations, but she truly had the ability and skills. Although "Mu Guiying Breaking the Heavenly Gate Formation" is just a legend, the people love her, spread her story, and constantly enrich and fill out her character. In fact, she has become the embodiment of the ideal woman, known to every household and praised by everyone among the working people of our country. She is deeply aware of righteousness, loves the country and the people, has principles, and understands human nature; she is energetic, dares to speak and act, has courage and resourcefulness; she has a deep understanding of military strategy and is highly skilled in martial arts. As for being beautiful, passionate, upright, and humorous, those are secondary.

Such a lovable female hero, there was only one in the past, and mostly just an ideal; now, she has transformed from one into thousands upon thousands, turning the ideal into reality. Moreover, the Mu Guiying of the past was limited by the times and could not be perfect. The Mu Guiying of today has already surpassed her former self in every way. This is because in the old society, like countless ropes, the people, especially women, were tightly bound, unable to move. Let alone having any strength, even if they had strength, they could not use it. But the new society has untied these thousands of ropes, the people are like fish in water, and women can also show their skills. You have strength, just use it, if you can't use it, we will help you use it. As long as you don't abandon yourself, you can become a hero. It is precisely: "To count the outstanding figures, we must look at the present."

However, there are also a very small number of female comrades who, perhaps not yet accustomed to this liberation, or perhaps still infatuated with the ropes of the old society, never seem to show great strength. Some of them are still admiring the sickly beauty of Xi Shi clutching her heart, some are as weak as Lin Daiyu; some simply huddle in small circles, "seeking and searching" with Li Qingzhao, feeling "dreary, desolate, and miserable".... How incompatible this is with the vigorous and lively era! I don't mean to negate these historical or legendary figures, they have their lovable aspects, but they also have prominent weaknesses and shortcomings. These weaknesses and shortcomings, we can see at a glance now, but they were precisely what the literati and ruling class of the old era admired, praised, and established as models for women. These fallacies have been passed down and have harmed people for thousands of years. Today, this poison must be eradicated, we do not want these pale beauties and unhealthy emotions. If anyone is still so delicate, there is a good medicine to cure them: go to labor and train!

    学习穆桂英
    周成
    星期天到北京建国门外未来的东风湖上去挖土，见许多女同志争先恐后，尽拣重活儿干。沉重的担子搁在肩膀上，却健步如飞，真正不亚于身强力壮的小伙子。怪不得广播员在表扬武松式的英雄人物的同时，不断提到这个那个女同志：“干活真卖劲，赛过穆桂英。”而且穆桂英们自己还不断挑战应战，也向武松们挑战应战。有位女同志上去对准扩音器表露她们缝纫社十几位绣花女工的心意，是要向全工地的英雄们比比干劲。条件中除了多装快跑外，还要改进工具，作出事半功倍的成绩来，等等。这种豪迈的气势震撼了每一颗心。她们，平日只是坐在屋里拿着针儿穿来穿去，运用的是纤巧的双手、心细如发的功夫。谁料一来到这宽广的建设世界，顿时力大无穷，勇气无限，智慧胜天。这真令某些白面书生汗颜。我觉得混身发热，竟立时生出了令自己也感到惊讶的大劲道来，火辣辣地投进劳动中去了。
    像这样的工地，全国何止万千，会有多少个穆桂英出现？其实又岂止在这种工地上才有，在田庄、农场、工厂、学校、机关，到处都有。4月20日周总理到郑州市郊区燕庄乡关虎屯农业社，曾说：“好呀，你们这里的老年人和妇女都能干，真是老年赛过老黄忠，妇女赛过穆桂英。”（见4月24日人民日报报道）现时代的我国妇女，工作不论性质，年纪不论老幼，几乎个个把穆桂英当作自己的榜样。就连北京宣武区一位六十九岁的家庭妇女刘文清，也向全市家庭妇女挑战说：“全国人民都在跃进，我们家庭妇女决不落后，一定要赛过中国历史上的穆桂英。”（见3月6日北京日报报道）
    且不忙去考证我国历史上是否实有过穆桂英其人其事，因为谁都已经知道，穆桂英在杨家将传说中，从大破天门阵起，就一直是宋辽交战中的突出人物。天门阵是辽邦聘请高人摆下的一个凶险无比的坚固堡垒，宋营上下将帅云集，个个发愁，人人无策，谁敢去打，谁敢去破。不料小小穆桂英，竟然表示：“自幼儿学武艺深通兵法，纵有那千万阵也能斩杀。”故事发展证明，她并不是为了救杨宗保才情急夸下海口，也不是不自量力任意说大话，而是确实有能耐有本事。尽管“穆桂英大破天门阵”不过是一种传说，但人民爱戴她，传诵她，而且不断丰富和充实她的性格，事实上她已成了我国劳动人民家喻户晓、有口皆碑的理想妇女的化身了。她深明大义，爱国爱民，有原则，通人情；朝气蓬勃，敢说敢为，有勇有谋；深通兵法，武艺高强。至于美丽、热情、正直、风趣等等，还在其次。
    这样可爱的女英雄，当年不过一个，而且多半是理想；现在则已化一个为千千万万，变理想为现实了。而且当年穆桂英受时代限制，还不可能尽善尽美，现今的穆桂英早已青出于蓝，胜过多多了。这是因为，旧社会像无数根绳索，人民、尤其是妇女被捆得紧紧的，动弹不得，别说已经一点劲道也没有了，就是有劲也使不出。但新社会解开了这万道绳索，人民如鱼得水，妇女也能大显身手。你有劲尽管使出来，使不出也会帮你使。只要你不自暴自弃，就可能成为英雄。正是：“数风流人物，还看今朝。”
    然而也还有极少数女同志，不知是还不习惯这种解放，还是迷恋于旧社会的绳索，总也不见使出大劲来。她们有的还在欣赏西施捧心的病态美，有的弱不禁风如林黛玉；有的干脆钻在小圈子里，同李清照一起“寻寻觅觅”，感到“冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨戚戚”……。这和轰轰烈烈的时代是多么不调和！我倒不是要否定历史上的或者传说中的这些人物，她们有可爱处，但是也有突出的弱点和缺点。这些弱点、缺点，我们现在一眼就能看出，然而却正是旧时代的文人、统治阶级所欣赏、赞美，定为妇女的典范的。谬种流传，遗害千古。今天，遗毒必须肃清，我们不要这些苍白的美和不健康的感情。谁如果还这样娇滴滴地，有一帖良药可治：到劳动中去锻炼！
