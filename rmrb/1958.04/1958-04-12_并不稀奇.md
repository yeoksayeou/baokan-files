Notes

    Not Surprising
    Washington officials recently stated that the United States has refused to give Laos more "aid" unless the Lao government "agrees" to reform its currency system. This kind of blatant interference in other countries' internal affairs is outrageous, so even the "Wall Street Journal" believes that this is "blatant interference in the internal affairs of an independent country."
    However, the "Wall Street Journal" went on to say that this kind of interference is "unusual in American diplomatic history," which seems surprising. In fact, what is so surprising about this? The United States has always used "aid" to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, and Laos is just the most recent example. The "Wall Street Journal" is obviously deliberately playing dumb in order to cover up for the United States.

    并不稀奇
    华盛顿的官员们最近表示，美国已经拒绝给老挝更多的“援助”，除非老挝政府“答应”改革币制。这种公开干涉他国内政的行径未免太不像话，所以连“华尔街日报”也认为这是“露骨地干涉一个自立国家的内政”。
    不过，“华尔街日报”又接着说，这种干涉“在美国外交史上是异乎寻常的”，似乎令人感到稀奇。其实，这有什么稀奇呢？美国一向就是利用“援助”干涉他国内政的，老挝仅仅是最近的一个例子而已。“华尔街日报”为了替美国打掩护，显然是在故意装糊涂。
