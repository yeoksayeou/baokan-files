Huangzhong County Mobilizes All People to Support Each Other
Six Days to Repair More Than 1,000 Kilometers of Canals

This newspaper reports that the broad masses of peasants in Huangzhong County, displaying the spirit of communism, fully mobilized and supported each other, repairing over 1,390 kilometers of canals in six days.

When the call for a crash canal repair campaign was issued by the Huangzhong County Party Committee and reached the masses, many members of agricultural cooperatives immediately loaded their packed tents, tools, bellows, pots and stoves onto large carts. Except for a small number of people left to watch the doors, households in the villages all turned out. The townships and cooperatives residing at the foot of the mountains, who feared flooding more than drought, also devoted all their efforts to support canal repair in other areas, just like the shallow mountain arid regions. Tanglongtai and Wusan Cooperatives, which had already been water conservancy projects last year, also actively supported the Hongshuiquan Wuyi Main Canal and went to Sitai Township to provide support. Tanglong Shangzhuang is a cooperative that would not benefit, and canal construction would even require digging up their land, but the cooperative members said that they were willing to do so for the prosperity of all. As a result, Huangzhong County achieved great success in six days.

    湟中县全民动员相互支援
    六天修渠一千多公里
    本报讯　湟中县广大农民发扬共产主义精神，全部动员起来，互相支援，六天修渠一千三百九十多公里。
    当中共湟中县委提出突击修渠的号召传达到群众中的时候，许多农业社的社员立即把收拾好的帐篷、工具、风箱、锅灶等装上大车，村子里除留下少数人看门而外，一户一户的都出动了。居住在脑山脚下的乡、社，他们怕的不是旱而是涝，但也都和浅山旱地区一样，倾尽全力支援旁的地区修渠。唐隆台、五三等社去年就水利化了，他们也积极地支援了洪水泉五一干渠，又到四台乡去支援。唐隆上庄是不受益的社，而且修渠还要挖他们的地，但是社员们说，为了大家富裕，我们情愿这样干。因此，湟中县在六天内就取得了很大成绩。
