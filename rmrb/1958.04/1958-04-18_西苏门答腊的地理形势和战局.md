    The Indonesian government forces began landing on the east coast of Central Sumatra on March 10. After about half a month of fighting, the rebels in the entire Riau region of eastern Central Sumatra were completely cleared. Following this victory, the government forces advanced westward, targeting the rebel base – West Sumatra. On the morning of April 17, government forces again landed from the sea on the coast of West Sumatra near Padang, the nest of the rebel group.

    West Sumatra is one of the six provinces/provincial autonomous regions in all of Sumatra. They are: Aceh, North Sumatra, West Sumatra, Riau, Jambi, and South Sumatra. During the past colonial rule, the entire island of Sumatra was one province. Geographically, people sometimes used the terms East Sumatra and West Sumatra, referring to the part facing the Strait of Malacca, centered on Medan, as East Sumatra, and the part facing the Indian Ocean, centered on Padang and Bukittinggi, as West Sumatra.

    West Sumatra is located on the western foothills of the Bukit Barisan mountain range that runs through the entire island. It is mostly mountainous, with a railway starting from Padang and three highways centered on Bukittinggi. The main products are cement, coal, tobacco, rubber, coffee, and tea.

    The rebel strongholds – Padang and Bukittinggi – are the largest and most important cities in West Sumatra; Bukittinggi is the capital of the West Sumatra autonomous region.

    Padang is surrounded by mountains on three sides and faces the Indian Ocean on one side. It is the largest commercial port in West Sumatra. It used to be one of the two capitals of the region, along with Bukittinggi. The city has a population of about 200,000. To the west of the city is the famous Teluk Bayur seaport, which is one of the important ports for the Hussein rebel group's illegal barter trade.

    Bukittinggi is located on a plateau in the mountains, 98 kilometers southwest of Padang, with a population of about 100,000. It is a center for highways and railways and has strategic significance. It is also a popular summer resort and sanatorium.

    The Indonesian government forces, advancing victoriously westward from the Riau region, are now converging on the Padang-Bukittinggi area in two routes.

    The northern route government forces, advancing westward from Pekanbaru (in the Riau region), an important oil industrial city, liberated Bangkinang on March 28. Bangkinang is over 100 kilometers northeast of Bukittinggi. The recapture of Bangkinang indicates that the government forces have entered the West Sumatra region and crossed the main peak of the Bukit Barisan mountain range. On April 8, this route of troops also liberated Payakumbuh, which is a highway transportation hub connecting Bukittinggi, Bangkinang, and Payakumbuh. Now, the spearhead of the attack is pointing towards Payakumbuh.

    Payakumbuh is another major city in West Sumatra, an important stronghold on the outskirts of Bukittinggi, with a population of over 10,000. It produces tobacco, coffee, tea, and rubber, and is about 70 kilometers from Bukittinggi.

    The southern route government forces liberated Taluk, a city near the border of Riau and West Sumatra, on March 25, and continued westward, liberating Rumbai on April 4. Rumbai is an important town for the rebels, about 100 kilometers west of Padang and about 40 kilometers from the main oil supply line connecting Central Sumatra and South Sumatra. On April 15, Sungai Dareh was also recovered, which is an important transportation center in West Sumatra connecting to South Sumatra. It is reported that the oil and "messengers" used by the rebel group usually pass through here. It is about 90 kilometers east of Padang.

    Now, this route of government forces may be able to cut off the rebels' escape route to Jambi and South Sumatra at any time, and its offensive spearhead will successively point to important cities such as Kiliran Jao, Tanjung Gadang, and Solok. Among them, Kiliran Jao is an important highway intersection from Bukittinggi to South Sumatra. Solok is one of the larger cities in West Sumatra, located on the railway line, and is the transportation center of Padang, Bukittinggi, and Sawahlunto, 37 kilometers from Padang. News has it that the rebels are currently frantically building defenses in the Singkarak Lake area north of Solok.

    The government forces in North Sumatra, after clearing the rebels in the Medan area, divided their troops and advanced south, and have recently entered the Tapanuli area adjacent to West Sumatra, to encircle and annihilate the fleeing rebels there. Now, the government forces and people's guerrillas have controlled the highway from West Sumatra to North Sumatra.

    Inside West Sumatra, the uprisings and guerrilla activities of the local people against the rebels are also becoming increasingly powerful.

    In Sawahlunto and Padang Panjang, the other two larger cities in West Sumatra, there are also activities against the rebels. Sawahlunto is about 60 kilometers west of Padang and forms a roughly equilateral triangle with Padang and Bukittinggi. It is famous for its coal production, with a population of about 20,000. In February and March of this year, the people here and in other areas held demonstrations against the rebels. Padang Panjang is located on the railway line between Bukittinggi and Padang. It is a famous Islamic center. According to news on the 11th, some soldiers of a battalion originally stationed here have already mutinied.

    In Sasak, a small coastal town 80 kilometers northwest of Bukittinggi, an uprising recently broke out. Under the attack of the uprising troops, the rebels have abandoned the city and fled in disarray.

    In Kamang, only 14 kilometers away from Bukittinggi, the military police here also mutinied. Kamang was the battlefield where the Indonesian national hero Imam Bonjol resisted the Dutch invaders in the early 19th century, and now its insurgents have dealt a heavy blow to the rebels.

    The rebel group is being encircled and annihilated by the government forces from the outside, and resisted by the local people from the inside. Their situation is becoming increasingly embarrassing. The government forces are about to launch the final stage of the attack on Padang and Bukittinggi. The ultimate failure of the rebels is not far away.

    西苏门答腊的地理形势和战局
    印度尼西亚政府军3月10日开始在中苏门答腊东海岸登陆。经过半个月左右的战斗，中苏门答腊东部整个廖内地区的叛军全部肃清。接着，政府军乘胜向西挺进，矛头指向叛乱分子的基地——西苏门答腊。4月17日清晨，政府军又从海上在叛乱集团巢穴巴东附近的西苏门答腊海岸登陆。
    西苏门答腊是全苏门答腊六个省、省级自治区之一。它们是：亚齐、北苏门答腊、西苏门答腊、廖内、占碑和南苏门答腊。在过去殖民统治时代，整个苏门答腊岛是一个省，人们在地理上有时也使用东苏门答腊和西苏门答腊的名词，把面对马六甲海峡、以棉兰为中心的部分称为东苏门答腊，把面临印度洋、以巴东和武吉丁宜为中心的部分叫做西苏门答腊。
    西苏门答腊位于纵贯全岛的武吉巴里散山脉西麓，山区较多，境内有以巴东为起点的一条铁路和以武吉丁宜为中心的三条公路。主要物产有水泥、煤、烟草、橡胶、咖啡和茶叶。
    叛乱分子盘踞的中心——巴东和武吉丁宜，是西苏门答腊最大和最重要的城市；武吉丁宜是西苏门答腊自治区的首府。
    巴东三面环山，一面临印度洋，它是西苏门答腊最大的商埠。曾与武吉丁宜同时作为这个地区的两个首府。全市人口约二十万，市西有著名的德鹿巴油海港，这里是侯赛尼叛乱集团进行非法的易货贸易的重要港口之一。
    武吉丁宜位于群山中的高原上，西南距巴东九十八公里，人口约十万人，它是公路和铁路的中心，富有战略意义。它又是避暑和休养的胜地。
    从廖内地区乘胜西进的印度尼西亚政府军，现在正由两路向巴东—武吉丁宜地区合击前进。
    从重要石油工业城市北干巴鲁（属廖内地区）向西挺进的北路政府军，3月28日光复班基南。班基南在武吉丁宜东北百余公里。班基南的收复表明政府军已经进入西苏门答腊区，越过了武吉巴里散山脉的主峰。4月8日，这路军队又解放了浮罗加东，浮罗加东是连结武吉丁宜、班基南和巴雅公务的公路交通枢纽。现在，进攻矛头正指向巴雅公务。
    巴雅公务也是西苏门答腊另一个较大的城市，它是武吉丁宜外围的重要据点，人口约万余人，出产烟草、咖啡、茶叶和橡胶，距武吉丁宜约七十公里。
    南路的政府军在3月25日解放了廖内和西苏门答腊边界附近的城市塔卢克，继续西指，4月4日光复鲁务占碑。鲁务占碑是叛乱分子的重镇，西距巴东约一百公里，距连结中苏门答腊与南苏门答腊的主要石油供应线约四十公里。4月15日，又收复双溪冷沙，这里是西苏门答腊通往南苏门答腊的重要交通中心，据报道，叛乱集团用的石油和“信使”通常都通过这里。它在巴东之东约九十公里。
    现在，这路政府军已经有可能随时切断叛乱分子逃往占碑和南苏门答腊的道路，它的进攻矛头将依次指向基利兰饶、丹绒加东、梭洛等重要城市。其中，基利兰饶是武吉丁宜通往南苏门答腊的重要公路交叉点。梭洛是西苏门答腊较大城市之一，位于铁道边，是巴东、武吉丁宜和沙哇伦多的交通中心，距巴东三十七公里。有消息说，叛军目前正慌忙地在梭洛以北的新卡腊湖地区构筑防线。
    北苏门答腊的政府军，肃清了棉兰地区的叛军后，分兵向南前进，最近已经开入与西苏门答腊毗邻的打板奴里地区，围歼窜逃到那里的叛军。现在政府军和人民游击队已经控制了从西苏门答腊通到北苏门答腊的公路。
    在西苏门答腊内部，当地人民反抗叛乱分子的起义和游击活动也日益声势浩大。
    在西苏门答腊其他两个较大城市沙哇伦多、巴东班让，都有反抗叛乱分子的活动。沙哇伦多西距巴东约六十公里与巴东、武吉丁宜构成大致相等的三角形，它以产煤著名，人口约两万人，今年2、3月间，这里和其他地区的人民，曾经举行反对叛乱分子的示威。巴东班让位于武吉丁宜和巴东之间的铁路线上，它是著名的伊斯兰教中心，据11日的消息，原驻这里的一个营的部分士兵已经起义。
    在武吉丁宜西北八十公里的滨海小城沙沙克，最近爆发起义。叛乱分子在起义军队的打击下，已经弃城鼠窜。
    就在距武吉丁宜只有十四公里之遥的卡芒，这里的军警也起义了。卡芒是十九世纪初期印度尼西亚民族英雄伊曼·本佐尔反抗荷兰侵略者的战场，现在它的起义者又沉重地打击了叛乱分子。
    叛乱集团外部遭到政府军的胜利围歼，内部又受到当地人民的反抗，他们的处境日益狼狈。政府军即将对巴东和武吉丁宜发动最后阶段的攻击。叛乱分子最后失败的命运是不远了。
