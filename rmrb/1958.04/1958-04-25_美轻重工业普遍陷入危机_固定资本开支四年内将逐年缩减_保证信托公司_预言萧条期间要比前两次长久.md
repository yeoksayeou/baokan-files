Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd Dispatch from TASS: The economic recession has now affected almost all heavy and light industrial sectors in the United States. By the beginning of April this year, compared with the same period last year, steel production decreased by 45%, coal production decreased by 24%, oil production decreased by 16%, automobile production decreased by 40%, machinery and equipment production decreased by 20%, and textile and garment industry products decreased by 11%.

According to the weekly work index of many industrial sectors, the first half of April showed an even greater decline compared to March than March compared to February.

Expenditure on updating and expanding fixed capital is also continuing to decrease. Most authoritative American economists believe that industrial production cannot achieve a new "healthy" surge until the process of reducing expenditure on updating and expanding production capacity stops. However, there are currently no signs that this process is about to end. Many signs indicate that this process is actually in its early stages and will continue for a long time. In this regard, the results of the "McGraw-Hill" publishing company's regular survey of industrial, transportation, and trading companies are very meaningful. According to the materials from this survey, the actual expenditure of American companies on updating and expanding production capacity in 1957 was $38.4 billion. These companies planned to spend $34 billion in this area in 1958, $31.2 billion in 1959, $30.6 billion in 1960, and $29.6 billion in 1961. "Business Week" pointed out that the figures cited in the "McGraw-Hill" company's statistics are probably not very comforting to those "optimists" who predict that industrial production will start a new upswing this autumn.

The bulletin "Guaranty Survey," published by the large New York bank "Guaranty Trust Company," also disagrees with the notion (such as that of Commerce Secretary Weeks) that the economic recession has "bottomed out." The bulletin said that with the reduction in expenditure on expanding production capacity, the business depression, and the clearing of excess commodities far from over, "the claim that the economic recession has bottomed out is not very convincing."

"Guaranty Survey" believes that the main problem is not that the decline in industrial production is about to reach its "bottom," but that the American economy will remain at this "bottom" for a long time; in other words, there will be a long period of depression. The bulletin believes that, judging from various signs, this period of depression will be longer than the economic recessions of 1948 to 1949 and 1953 to 1954. "Guaranty Survey" wrote that, under these circumstances, "even if the number of unemployed people does not increase further, the poverty and suffering caused by unemployment will become more severe, because the longer a person is unemployed, the more precarious his situation becomes as he loses his right to receive benefits and spends all his savings."

The American banking and stockbroker publication "Barron's Weekly" wrote: "More and more signs indicate that the United States is facing something more serious in 1958, something that can be called a cyclical recession or economic crisis." It called on people to "treat things realistically."

### 美轻重工业普遍陷入危机  固定资本开支四年内将逐年缩减  “保证信托公司”预言萧条期间要比前两次长久

    美轻重工业普遍陷入危机
    固定资本开支四年内将逐年缩减
    “保证信托公司”预言萧条期间要比前两次长久
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社纽约23日讯：经济衰退现在已经差不多波及美国所有的重工业和轻工业部门。到今年4月初，同去年同一时期比较，钢产量减少了45％，煤产量减少了24％，石油产量减少了16％，汽车产量减少了40％，机器设备产量减少了20％，纺织和缝纫工业品减少了11％。
    根据许多工业部门的每周工作指数，4月份上半月同3月份比较比3月份同2月份比较还有更大的下降。
    更新和扩大固定资本的开支也在继续减少。大多数最权威的美国经济学家认为，在用于更新和扩大生产能力的开支缩减过程没有停止以前，工业生产是不可能出现新的“健康的”高涨的。但是目前还没有任何迹象表明这个过程即将结束。许多迹象表明，这个过程实际上正处于早期阶段，它还要继续很长一段时间。在这方面，“麦克格劳·希尔”出版公司对工业、运输和贸易公司进行定期调查的结果是很有意义的。根据这种调查的材料，1957年美国各公司更新和扩大生产能力的实际开支是三百八十四亿美元。这些公司拟定1958年用于这方面的开支是三百四十亿美元，1959年是三百一十二亿美元，1960年是三百零六亿美元，1961年是二百九十六亿美元。“商业周刊”指出，“麦克格劳·希尔”公司统计材料中所举出的数字恐怕很难使那些预言今秋工业生产会开始一个新的高涨的“乐观主义者”感到高兴。
    纽约大银行“保证信托公司”出版的公报“保证调查”也不同意有人（如商务部长威克斯之流）认为经济衰退已经“到底”的说法。公报说，在扩大生产能力的开支在缩减、商业萧条、清除过剩商品的情况还远没有结束的情况下，“经济衰退已经到底的说法是不大令人信服的”。
    “保证调查”认为，主要问题还不在于工业生产的低落快要到“底”，而是美国的经济将要长久停留在这个“底”上，换句话说，就是要有一个长期的萧条阶段。公报认为，就各种迹象看来，这个萧条阶段将比1948到1949年的经济衰退以及1953到1954年的经济衰退的时间要长。“保证调查”写道，在这种情况下，“即使失业人数不再增加，失业现象所引起的贫困和痛苦也会变得更加严重，因为一个人失业的时间越长，他的境况也就随着他失去领取补助金的权利和花完他所有的储蓄而变得越来越没有保障。”
    美国银行和股票经纪人的机关刊“拜龙”周刊写道：“越来越多的迹象表明，美国在1958年面临着某种更严重的东西，某种可以称为周期性衰退或经济危机的东西。”它要求人们“实事求是地对待事物”。
