Persist in Implementing Cadre Study Plans
Qingyuan County Proposes Three Guarantee Conditions
    This newspaper, Guangzhou, 30th dispatch – All cadres in Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, according to the "Cadre Study Great Leap Forward Plan" formulated by the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department, put forward the battle cry of "Mobilize the whole party, study diligently for three years, ideologically leap forward, be both red and expert," and proposed to all county cadres in the province to launch a socialist competition in learning.
    This initiative was discussed and adopted at the recent enlarged meeting of the county party committee cadres. The initiative states that through study, we must achieve five competencies: the ability to distinguish right from wrong, the ability to work, the ability to produce, the ability to write articles, and the ability to give reports, to become cadres who are "proficient in both literary and military skills" and "both red and expert."
    The initiative put forward ten specific conditions, including four aspects: studying political theory, technical skills, culture, and writing. The initiative clearly stipulates three points: First, in terms of leadership methods, it is necessary to mobilize the entire party, with the secretary taking the lead, the propaganda department taking specific management responsibilities, and the county party committee and township party committees discussing cadre study issues every quarter; second, establish a new style of study, eliminate the "four airs" (laziness, lethargy, arrogance, squeamishness) in study, and promote a study style of "diligent study and hard work, mutual assistance, learning by doing, and integrating learning with application"; third, conduct regular inspections and summaries, carry out study evaluations, and continuously promote the leap forward in learning.
    The cadres in Qingyuan County have always done a relatively good job in political theory study. Since 1956, the county's office cadres have insisted on spending two hours a day on study, and in addition, they collectively read the newspaper every night without interruption. Many office cadres also "bring books to the countryside" for study when they travel on business. About 70% of the cadres of the Public Security Bureau are often rotated to work in the countryside, but they conduct self-study every time they go to the countryside to work and take time to write study notes. In the past year or so, the district and township cadres throughout the county have also established a "study day" system, and have been studying agricultural technology by participating in production and leading production. After the rectification movement began, district and township cadres also took a day to study the theoretical knowledge of agricultural production and held exams every time they came to the county for meetings.

    坚持实现干部的学习规划
    清远县提出三项保证条件
    本报广州30日电　广东省清远县全体干部根据省委宣传部制定的“干部学习大跃进规划”，提出“全党动员，苦学三年，思想跃进，又红又专”的战斗口号，向全省各县干部倡议在学习上开展社会主义竞赛。
    这个倡议是在最近召开的县委扩大干部会议上经过讨论通过的。倡议书中说，我们要通过学习，做到五会：会辨别是非、会工作、会生产、会写文章、会做报告，成为“文武双全”、“又红又专”的干部。
    倡议书提出了十项具体条件，包括学习政治理论、技术业务、文化和写作四个方面。倡议书明确规定了三点：一、在领导方法上，必须做到全党动手，书记带头，宣传部门具体管理负责，县委和乡党委每季讨论一次干部学习问题；二、树立新的学风，扫除学习中的“四气”（懒气、暮气、骄气、娇气），提倡“勤学苦钻、互相帮助，边做边学、学用一致”的学习风气；三、定期检查总结，开展学习评比，不断推动学习跃进。
    清远县的干部一向在政治理论学习上是搞得比较好的。从1956年开始，全县的机关干部一直坚持着每天有两小时用来学习，另外，每天晚上从不间断地集体进行读报。不少机关干部出差时也“带书下乡”学习。公安局的干部经常有七成左右轮流下乡，但他们每次下乡工作时都进行自学，并抽空写学习笔记。最近一年多来，全县的区乡干部也定有“学习日”的制度，并通过参加生产、领导生产，学习农业技术。整风运动开始后，区乡干部每次到县里开会时，还抽出一天时间学习农业生产的理论知识，并且举行测验。
