    Literary Teaching Should Also "Favor the Present and Devalue the Past"
    I believe that in literary research and literary teaching, we should also implement "favoring the present and devaluing the past."
    In recent years, secondary school literature textbooks have increased the content of classical literature, which has a positive effect on educating young people to love their national culture and to understand and inherit the cultural heritage of the motherland. However, the proportion of classical literature in textbooks is getting larger and larger. The first and second volumes of high school literature are entirely classical literature. I think this will lead young people to a path of detachment from reality. Now some students speak and write in a way that is neither classical nor modern, which is ridiculous. A small number of students blindly learn from the past, know nothing about modern literature, and take a contemptuous attitude towards the language of the masses.
    I suggest that the Ministry of Education readjust the proportion of classical literature and modern literature in secondary school literature textbooks, so that young people can pay more attention to real life.

### 文学教学也要“厚今薄古”

    文学教学也要“厚今薄古”
    我认为，在文学研究和文学教学中也要贯彻“厚今薄古”。
    近几年来，中学文学课本里增加了古典文学的内容，这对教育广大青年热爱祖国文化，认识并继承祖国文化遗产的重要意义，是有积极作用的。但是，古典文学在课本中的比重愈来愈大，高中文学一、二册完全是古典文学，我认为这会引导青年走脱离现实的道路。现在有些学生说话写文章似古非古，似今非今，令人啼笑皆非；有少数学生一味学古，对现代文学一无所知，对群众语言也采取轻视的态度。
    我建议教育部重新调整中学文学课本中古典文学和现代文学的比重，使青年更多地关心现实生活。
