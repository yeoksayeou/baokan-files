    Agricultural Science Serves Production
    Controlling Rice Panicle Grain
    (This report) According to reports from our newspaper: The research, led by rice expert Professor Ding Ying, aims to control the number of panicles and grains in rice to achieve planned yields. They strive to initially formulate cultivation measures by early next year, one year ahead of schedule, and aim to develop a set of scientific regulations for cultivation techniques related to controlling the number of rice panicles and grains by 1962. This will further apply the mass's experience in achieving high yields to other regions.
    The yield per unit area of rice is determined by the total number of panicles per unit area, the number of grains per panicle, and the plumpness of the grains. The number of panicles, the number of grains, and the plumpness are determined by the tillering development and young panicle development. From 1955 to 1956, under the direction of Ding Ying, systematic observations and studies were conducted for four consecutive seasons on the tillering development and young panicle development of densely planted rice. The regularity of the length of the effective and ineffective tillering periods of rice, the requirements of young panicle development for the external environment, etc., have been initially grasped. Experiments have shown that it is entirely possible to artificially control and adjust the length of effective and ineffective tillering periods, the number of tillers, the number of grains, and the plumpness using scientific methods.

    New Paddy Soaking Method
    (This report) According to reports from our newspaper: A new paddy soaking method that enables water-deficient areas to achieve increased rice production has been summarized by Professor Chen Xiang of Southwest Agricultural College and others. This paddy soaking method is a traditional experience of farmers in water-deficient areas of Sichuan.
    The new paddy soaking method involves using shallow water to soak the field during cultivation, concentrating the plowing and harrowing operations, plowing the field edges well, sealing the field ridges, leveling the field surface, and transplanting seedlings immediately. Using the new method to soak the paddy field can increase the content of soil aggregates and fine colloids, improve the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil and water dynamics, promote microbial activity, accelerate the conversion rate of available nutrients, and enhance the effectiveness of water retention, fertilizer retention, and heat preservation, allowing rice to grow better.
    Currently, Southwest Agricultural College is preparing to further identify the experience of implementing the "new paddy soaking method" in various soil types.

    Hybridization of Indica and Japonica Rice
    (This report) According to reports from our newspaper: Professor Yang Shouren of Shenyang Agricultural College has successfully hybridized Indica and Japonica rice. The hybrid species have the advantages of both Indica and Japonica rice and none of their disadvantages.
    Indica and Japonica rice are the two major types of cultivated rice in our country. Indica rice is suitable for cultivation in hot areas, grows easily, and generally has a stronger resistance to pests and diseases, but it is not resistant to cold, and the rice quality is generally poor. Japonica rice is both cold-resistant and has good rice quality, but it does not grow easily in hot areas and generally has a weaker resistance to pests and diseases.
    After seven years of research and experimentation, Professor Yang Shouren finally used the most famous early rice "Nante No. 1" in southern China and the famous double-cropping early rice "Kasa" from Japan to cultivate high-quality rice varieties and solved the problem of seed setting rate.

    控制水稻穗粒
    本报讯　由水稻专家丁颖教授主持的控制水稻长出预期的穗数和粒数、达到计划产量目的的研究，争取提前一年在明年初步制订出栽培措施，并争取在1962年对有关控制水稻穗数粒数的栽培技术，订出一套科学规程，使群众的丰产经验进一步运用到其他地区。
    水稻单位面积产量是决定于单位面积内的总穗数、每穗长的谷粒数和谷粒的充实程度的。而穗数的多少、谷粒数和充实度，又决定于分蘖发育和幼穗发育状况的。从1955年到1956年，在丁颖主持下，曾连续四个季节对小科密植栽培的水稻分蘖发育现象和幼穗发育现象，进行了系统的观察和研究，对于水稻有效分蘖期和无效分蘖期的长短、幼穗发育对外界环境的要求等，已初步掌握到它的规律性。试验表明，用科学力量人为地控制和调整有效和无效分蘖期的长短、分蘖数量的多少、谷粒的数量和充实度等，是完全可能的。（黎作骥）
    新的泡田法
    本报讯　一项使缺水地区能获得水稻增产的新泡田方法，已由西南农学院教授陈祥等总结出来。这种泡田方法是四川缺水地区农民的传统经验。
    新的泡田方法是耕作时用浅水泡田，将犁耙的次数集中进行，犁好田边，糊好田坎，拉平田面，即时栽秧。用新法泡田能使土壤团粒及细胶粒含量增多，改善土壤的理化生物性状及水颍动态，促进微生物的活动，使有效养分的转化速度加快，增强保水、保肥、保温的效能，使水稻更好地生长。
    目前，西南农学院正准备进一步找出在各种不同的土壤地里实行“新法泡田”的经验。

    秈稻粳稻杂交
    本报讯　沈阳农学院教授杨守仁研究秈稻和粳稻杂交成功。杂交种具有秈稻和粳稻的优点，没有秈稻和粳稻的缺点。
    秈稻和粳稻是我国栽培稻的两大类型。秈稻适于热地栽培，容易繁茂，一般抗病虫害的能力也较强，但不耐寒冷，一般米质也较差。粳稻既耐寒冷，米质也好，但在热地生长不易繁茂，一般抗病虫害能力较弱。
    杨守仁教授经过七年的研究试验，终于利用我国南方最著名的早稻“南特号”和日本有名的双季早稻“嘉笠”培育出品质优良的稻种，并且解决了结实率问题。
