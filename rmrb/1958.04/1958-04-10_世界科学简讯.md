　　Using Sound to Control Lathes
　　In the Vilnius Elfa Electrical Factory in the Soviet Union, hexagonal lathes producing complex parts are now directly controlled by "magnetic memory devices."
　　The operator first uses the lathe to manufacture the initial part. At this time, the electronic control mechanism installed on the lathe records the operation process on a magnetic tape. Subsequently, by turning the knob on the tape recorder to the "reproduce" setting, the recorder emits sounds of various frequencies. These sounds are received by a group of frequency relays and transmitted to the lathe. As the sound frequency changes, the operations performed by the lathe automatically change.
　　The advantage of this new automation method is that only the cutting tools need to be changed and the new operation process recorded on the magnetic tape of the tape recorder to manufacture another part. Moreover, a control mechanism with a "magnetic memory device" can control many lathes producing the same parts.
　　Processing Oil Shale Underground into Oil and Gas
　　Soviet Estonian scientists, together with experts from Moscow, have developed a method to process oil shale underground into shale oil and gas. Using this new method, Estonia can obtain billions of cubic meters of gas and hundreds of thousands of tons of shale oil from shale mines, and greatly reduce the cost of these products.
　　Some specialized factories are currently testing this method. They are currently mainly using this method to mine shale with low heat content that was not completely mined during shaft mining. When the well is drilled to the required depth, electrodes that can emit high-voltage current are installed. A circuit is created in the extremely dense and impermeable shale layer, and then the remaining shale along this circuit is burned through and thermally decomposed. The gas and tar produced in this way can be extracted to the surface through these wells.
　　Magnetic Tape Television Recorder
　　British scientists have invented a magnetic tape television recorder that can record sound and color television films simultaneously.
　　This recorder, which took more than two years to develop, is somewhat similar to a typical tape recorder. After recording the sound and image, simply place the tape on the machine for playback, and electronic pulses will cause the machine to emit sound and image.
　　Experiments have shown that broadcasting television with sound and images recorded by this machine is almost indistinguishable from live broadcasts. The recorded material can also be erased when not in use.
　　Material Harder Than Diamond
　　American young chemist Wentorf has created in the laboratory a substance that is no less hard than diamond and is cheaper—Borazon.
　　This is a boron-nitrogen compound with a cubic crystal lattice similar to the diamond crystal lattice—boron nitride.
　　As we all know, the constituent components of diamond and graphite are both carbon, but they differ in crystal structure. Diamond has a cubic crystal lattice and is therefore extremely hard, while graphite has a hexagonal crystal lattice and is therefore soft. Boron nitride was originally a soft material with a crystal structure similar to graphite. However, Wentorf treated it with a pressure of about 60,000 atmospheres and a high temperature of 1,600 degrees, resulting in a new material with a crystal structure similar to diamond.
　　Another advantage of this material is that its resistance to high temperatures is stronger than that of diamond. Diamond burns completely within two and a half minutes at a high temperature of 1,090 degrees, while Borazon suffers no damage.　　　　(Xinhua News Agency)

    世界科学简讯
    用声音操纵车床
    苏联维尔纽斯埃尔法电工厂一些生产外型复杂零件的六角车床，已经由“磁性记忆装置”直接操纵。
    操作者首先用车床制造第一个零件。这时安装在车床上的电子指挥机械就会把他的操作过程纪录在录音磁带上。随后，把磁带录音机上的旋纽转到“再生产”的字样上面，录音机就可发出各种频率的声音。这些声音由一组频率继电器接收，并传给车床。随着声音频率的改换，车床所进行的操作就会自动改变。
    这种自动化新方法的优点在于，只需要改换刀具和在磁带录音机的磁带上记入新的操作过程，就可以制造另一种零件。而且一个带有“磁性记忆装置”的指挥机械可以操纵许多生产同样零件的车床。
    把油母页岩在地下加工成油和煤气
    苏联爱沙尼亚科学家同莫斯科的专家们一起研究出了一种把油母页岩在地下加工成页岩油和煤气的方法。使用这种新方法可以使爱沙尼亚从页岩矿中多得到几十亿立方公尺的煤气和几十万吨的页岩油，并且可以大大降低这些产品的成本。
    现在有些专工厂正在试用这种方法。他们目前主要是用这种方法来开采含热量少而在矿井开采时未开采完的页岩。在井钻到必要深度的时候就安装上可以放出高压电流的电极。在密度极高的不透气的页岩层里造成一条电路，然后把沿着这条电路的剩余页岩烧透和进行热分解。这样生产出来的煤气和焦油可以通过这些井汲到地面上来。
    磁带电视纪录器
    英国科学家们发明了一种能把声音和彩色电视影片同时录下来的磁带电视纪录器。
    这个花了两年多时间才研究出来的纪录器与通常的磁带录音机有些相像。纪录了声音和形象后，只要把磁带安到机器上放送，电子脉冲就可以使机器发出声音和形象来。
    试验结果证明，用这种机器纪录的声音和形象来放送电视同实况播送几乎没有什么差别。纪录下来的材料不用时还可以洗掉。
    比金刚石还硬的物质
    美国青年化学家温托弗在实验室中制成了一种硬度不亚于金刚石而价钱便宜的物质——波拉松。
    这是一种带有与金刚石结晶格子相类似的立方体结晶格子的硼氮化合物——叠氮化硼。
    大家知道，金刚石和石墨的组成成份都是碳，只是晶体结构不同。金刚石是立方体结晶格子因而硬度极大，而石墨是六角形结晶格子因而是柔软的。叠氮化硼本来是一种晶体结构与石墨相同的柔软物质。但是温托弗利用六万大气压左右的压力和一千六百度的高温加以处理，结果它就变了一种晶体结构与金刚石类似的新物质。
    这种物质另一优点是抗高温的性质比金刚石还强。金刚石在一千零九度高温下两分半钟之内就会烧得干干净净，而波拉松却毫无损伤。　　　　（新华社）
