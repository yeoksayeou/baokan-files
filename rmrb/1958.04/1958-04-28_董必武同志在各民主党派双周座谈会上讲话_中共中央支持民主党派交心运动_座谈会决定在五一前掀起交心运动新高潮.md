Xinhua News Agency, April 27th. The democratic parties held an enlarged bi-weekly symposium on the afternoon of the 25th to report on the situation of the democratic parties' central committees engaging in the "Sharing Hearts" movement with the Party.

　　The meeting considered that the "Sharing Hearts" movement of the democratic parties has achieved remarkable results. However, there is still a need to go even further. Therefore, it was decided to push the "Sharing Hearts" movement further forward before May Day and launch a new upsurge. The slogan is: Make persistent efforts, share deeply and thoroughly, welcome May Day, and learn from the working class.

　　Comrade Dong Biwu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the meeting and spoke before the meeting concluded. He said that the "Sharing Hearts" movement is an important development in the rectification movement of the democratic parties and is a good thing. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China approves and supports this movement.

　　Dong Biwu pointed out that the current rectification movement of the Communist Party has developed into a new stage of the communist ideological liberation movement, and the rectification movement of the Communist Party is also a "Sharing Hearts" movement. He said that in order to implement the general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical," to go all out, and to aim high, to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction, there must be a team to fight. If the ideology of this team is not rectified, and there is no unified thought, it is impossible to win the battle. Therefore, it is necessary to basically unify the thinking of this team in order to win the battle. If the democratic parties do not rectify and do not share their hearts, it will be difficult to transition to socialism. From this point of view, the "Sharing Hearts" movement of the democratic parties has important significance.

　　Dong Biwu said that ideological struggle is a very difficult thing. There will be difficulties when sharing hearts, and it is impossible not to conduct ideological struggle. However, everyone should be determined to conduct a profound battle in their own minds and ensure victory. It is necessary to eliminate concerns, trust the Party, and completely overcome individualism. The purpose of sharing hearts is to transform thinking, unite 600 million people together, and strive for a common goal.

　　This meeting was chaired by Shi Liang, vice chairman of the China Democratic League. In her speech, she pointed out that in the past week, the democratic parties have launched a high tide of the "Sharing Hearts" movement. The heads of the central committees of the democratic parties and the cadres of the central organs have participated in the "Sharing Hearts" movement. The most someone shared more than 700 items, and the least shared dozens of items. Everyone expressed that they would improve their political consciousness and promote self-transformation by sharing their hearts with the Party. Everyone was full of energy and felt comfortable. This is another socialist political and ideological education.

　　Shi Liang said that, in general, the achievements of the "Sharing Hearts" movement in the past week are remarkable. In terms of quantity, a lot has been shared, but after thinking, more can be shared. In terms of quality, some people shared very well, some shared relatively well, but some people did not share deeply or thoroughly enough. Now that May Day is approaching, in the new situation of the great leap forward of workers and peasants across the country, our democratic parties should catch up and continue to leap forward on the path of self-transformation. We should push the "Sharing Hearts" movement further forward before May Day and launch a new upsurge, so that we can share deeply and thoroughly.

　　After Shi Liang's speech, Jiang Guangnai and Zhu Xuefan of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Hua Luogeng, Liang Sicheng, and Deng Chumin of the China Democratic League, Jin Keming of the Jiusan Society, and Zhang Tingqian of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, successively introduced their experiences and feelings of sharing their hearts with the Party. Wang Guangying of the China National Democratic Construction Association introduced the experience of Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles in carrying out the "Sharing Hearts" movement with the Party. They all intimately realized that the "Sharing Hearts" movement is the key to fundamentally transforming political positions, and it is a good thing for oneself, for the Party, for the people, and for socialism. However, when sharing hearts, it is necessary to solve unnecessary concerns such as being afraid that the Party will not trust oneself after sharing, and that the masses will look down on oneself. Only in this way can we open the door of thought and pour out the long-hidden, unsightly dirty things of the bourgeoisie, thoroughly disinfect them, and then break down and build up in a big way. They also pointed out that in the past, they always thought that they had been transformed almost completely and did not admit that they had the bourgeois position and thinking. However, after preliminary sharing of hearts, they found that they had not only the problem of the bourgeois position, but also the problem of bourgeois individualism, and even more the problem of being half-hearted towards the Party and socialism. Therefore, they felt that they urgently needed to be transformed, and some even asked to hang up the "emergency number" for self-transformation. They also said that after the initial sharing of hearts through ideological struggle, the ideological burden was indeed reduced, the mind began to be liberated, and the mood was indeed incomparably comfortable.

　　This symposium lasted for five hours. Some cadres of the central organs of the democratic parties, non-party democratic人士, and some students of the Socialist Academy also participated in the symposium.

### 董必武同志在各民主党派双周座谈会上讲话  中共中央支持民主党派交心运动  座谈会决定在五一前掀起交心运动新高潮

    董必武同志在各民主党派双周座谈会上讲话
    中共中央支持民主党派交心运动
    座谈会决定在五一前掀起交心运动新高潮
    新华社27日讯　各民主党派在25日下午举行双周座谈会扩大会议，汇报各民主党派中央向党交心运动的情况。
    会议认为，各民主党派的交心运动已经取得了显著的成绩。但是还需要百尺竿头更上一层。因此决定，在五一节以前，把交心运动再向前推进一步，掀起一个新的高潮。口号是：再接再厉，交深交透，迎接五一劳动节，向工人阶级学习。
    中共中央政治局委员董必武同志出席了会议，并且在会议结束前讲了话。他说，交心运动是民主党派整风运动的一个重要的发展，是一件好事情。中共中央赞成并且支持这个运动。
    董必武指出，目前共产党的整风运动，已发展到共产主义思想解放运动的新阶段，共产党的整风运动也是交心运动。他说，要贯彻多、快、好、省，鼓足干劲，力争上游的总路线，进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，就要有一支队伍来进行作战。这支队伍的思想不整顿，没有一致的思想，要取得战斗的胜利是不可能的。因此，必须使这个队伍的思想基本上取得一致，才能打胜仗。民主党派如果不整风，不交心，要过渡到社会主义是困难的。从这方面来讲，各民主党派的交心运动有重要的意义。
    董必武说，思想斗争是很困难的一件事情，在交心的时候，不会没有困难，不可能不进行思想斗争。但是，每个人应该下决心在自己脑子里进行一次深刻的战斗，并且保证打胜仗。要消除顾虑，相信党，彻底克服个人主义。交心的目的是为了改造思想，把六亿人民团结在一起，为一个共同的目标而奋斗。
    这次会议是由民盟副主席史良主持的。她在讲话中指出，在过去的一周中，各民主党派掀起了一个交心运动的高潮，各民主党派中央负责人和中央机关的干部都参加了交心运动，最多的一人交了七百多条，最少的也交了几十条。大家都表示要通过向党交心，来提高政治觉悟，促进自我改造。大家精神饱满，心情舒畅。这是又一次的社会主义政治思想教育。
    史良说，总起来说，前一周的交心运动成绩是显著的。就数量上来说，已经交得不少了，但经过思考，还可以再多交一些。就质量来说，有些人交得很好，有些人交得比较好，但也有一些人交得还不深，还不透。现在五一节快到了，在全国工人农民大跃进的新形势下，我们各民主党派更应该迎头赶上，首先在自我改造的途程上，应当继续向前跃进。应当在五一节前把交心运动再向前推进一步，掀起一个新的高潮，要作到交深交透。
    在史良讲话以后，民革的蒋光鼐、朱学范，民盟的华罗庚、梁思成、邓初民，九三的金克木，民进的章廷谦，先后介绍了他们各自向党交心的经过和体会。民建的王光英介绍了天津市工商界人士开展向党交心运动的经验。他们都亲切地体会到，交心运动是根本改造政治立场的关键，它对自己对党对人民和对社会主义都是一件好事情。但是交心的时候必须解决怕交出来党不信任自己、群众看不起自己等等不必要的顾虑。只有这样才能敞开思想大门把长期隐藏在内心的、见不得人的资产阶级的肮脏东西倾囊倒出，彻底消毒，从而才能大破大立。他们还指出，过去总以为自己已经改造得差不多了，不承认自己有资产阶级的立场和思想，但是，经过初步交心以后，发现自己既有资产阶级立场的问题，也有资产阶级个人主义思想问题，更有对党对社会主义三心二意的问题。因此感到自己迫切需要改造，甚至有人要求挂自我改造的“急诊号”。他们还说，在经过思想斗争初步交心以后，思想负担的确减少了，思想开始解放了，心情的确无比的舒畅了。
    这个座谈会共进行了五个小时。参加座谈会的，还有各民主党派中央机关一部分干部、无党派民主人士和社会主义学院的一部分学员。
