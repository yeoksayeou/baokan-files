Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 9th -- Padang and Bukit Tinggi, seized by the West Sumatran rebel group, are becoming increasingly isolated day by day, and government troops are advancing towards these cities.

The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper reported today that government troops and people's guerrillas have controlled the highway from West Sumatra to Tarutung in North Sumatra. In addition, the insurgent West Sumatran army recently defeated the rebels in Sasak, and the rebels have fled the city. Sasak is a coastal town eighty kilometers northwest of Bukit Tinggi.

Another source said that the people are launching activities against the rebels in the Bukit Tinggi and Padang areas. Many young people, along with the insurgent police, have fled these two rebel-controlled cities. The mobile police team led by Kaharudin exchanged fire with Hussein's patrol team in Kamang, fourteen kilometers from Bukit Tinggi. They also attacked the rebel-controlled Gadu Airport with the insurgent army of Noor Matias, causing heavy losses to the rebels.

Rebel leader Hussein is attempting to absorb the "Islamic Army" into his army to resist the government's offensive. The "Islamic Army" is a group of armed bandits scattered in Aceh and other parts of North Sumatra, who are carrying out anti-government activities with the support of imperialism.

According to a late news report just received, Hamzah, Chief of Staff of the Aceh Defense District in North Sumatra, told the press in Medan on the 5th that the Nien Golan rebels who had fled to Aceh had all surrendered to the Aceh Defense District Headquarters, and they are now being housed in barracks awaiting disposal.

    政府军和起义武装内外夹攻
    苏门答腊叛军巢穴愈陷孤立
    逃往亚齐的奈恩戈兰叛军全部投降
    新华社雅加达9日电　西苏门答腊叛乱集团窃据的巴东和武吉丁宜正在一天天被孤立，政府军正在向这些城市挺进。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”今天报道，政府军和人民游击队已经控制了从西苏门答腊通到北苏门答腊打板奴里的公路。另外，起义的西苏门答腊军队在最近击溃了沙沙克的叛乱分子，叛乱分子已经从这个城市逃走。沙沙克是武吉丁宜西北八十公里处的一个滨海小城。
    另一消息说，人民正在展开反对武吉丁宜和巴东一带的叛军的活动。已经有很多青年同起义的警察一起，逃离这两个叛军控制的城市。卡哈鲁丁率领的机动警察队，在离武吉丁宜十四公里的卡芒地方同侯赛尼的巡逻队交火。他们还同努尔·马提亚斯的起义军队一起进攻叛军控制的加杜机场，使叛军遭到严重损失。
    叛乱头子侯赛尼正在企图把“伊斯兰教军”吸收到他的军队里，用来抵抗政府军的进攻。“伊斯兰教军”是分散在北苏门答腊亚齐等地的武装匪帮，他们在帝国主义的支持下进行反政府的勾当。
    另据刚接获的迟到消息，北苏门答腊亚齐防区参谋长哈姆扎赫5日在棉兰向报界说，逃到亚齐的奈恩戈兰叛军已经全部向亚齐防区司令部投降，他们现在被安置在营房里等候处理。
