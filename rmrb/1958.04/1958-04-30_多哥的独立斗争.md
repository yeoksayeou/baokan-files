    Togo's Struggle for Independence
    The result of the Togolese Legislative Assembly election is that the nationalist party demanding complete independence for Togo—the Togolese Unification Committee—has won. The Legislative Assembly will have the power to decide to abolish the trusteeship system and grant Togo independence. This is the result of the long-term struggle of the Togolese people for independence and freedom.
    Togo is located in southwestern Africa, with an area of 88,000 square kilometers. In 1884, Togo was annexed by Germany and ruled by Germany for more than 30 years. After the First World War, Britain and France divided Togo, with Britain occupying the west and France occupying the east. In 1922, Britain and France, under the guise of the League of Nations, obtained a mandate over Togo. In December 1946, the United Nations Trusteeship Council decided that Britain and France should continue to administer the trust separately. After Ghana became independent last year, western Togo joined Ghana. Eastern Togo, still under French trusteeship, accounts for three-fifths of the total area of ​​Togo, with a population of 1.08 million, most of whom are black Africans, and residents in coastal areas are mostly Portuguese mixed races.
    For more than ten years, the people of the French-administered Togolese region have been engaged in an arduous struggle for independence. In September 1956, a fierce riot against French rule broke out. After western Togo joined independent Ghana, it further encouraged the people of eastern Togo to strive for national liberation. In July last year, they held large-scale demonstrations, and more than 80% of workers and staff also held strikes to protest against French colonial rule.
    In order to ease the struggle of the Togolese people, the French colonialists announced in August 1956 that Togo was an "autonomous republic," actually implementing colonial rule under the guise of autonomy. In October of the same year, France also played the trick of so-called popular voting to support this "autonomy." However, these methods cannot deceive people. The Togolese Unification Committee resisted this "referendum," and the Togolese people continued to oppose "autonomy" and demanded independence.
    Last year, the United Nations General Assembly discussed the Togo issue and adopted a resolution to hold elections for the Togolese Legislative Assembly under the supervision of the United Nations. France originally intended to use this election to "legally" incorporate Togo into the French Federation, but this attempt failed in the face of the Togolese people's anti-colonialist struggle.

    多哥的独立斗争
    多哥立法议会选举的结果，要求多哥完全独立的民族主义政党——多哥统一委员会获得了胜利。立法议会将有权决定废除托管制度，使多哥得到独立。这是多哥人民争取独立自由的长期斗争的结果。
    多哥位于西南非洲，面积八万八千平方公里。1884年，多哥被德国吞并，被德国统治了三十多年。第一次世界大战后，英法两国瓜分了多哥，英国占领西部，法国占领东部。1922年，英法假手国际联盟，在多哥取得委任统治权。1946年12月，联合国托管理事会决定，仍由英法继续分别托管。去年加纳独立后，西部多哥加入了加纳。仍受法国托管的多哥东部，占全部多哥面积的五分之三，人口一百零八万，其中绝大多数是非洲黑人，沿海地区居民多是葡萄牙混血种。
    法国托管区多哥人民十多年来进行了争取独立的艰巨斗争。1956年9月曾爆发了反对法国统治的猛烈骚动。多哥西部加入独立的加纳后，更加鼓舞了多哥东部人民争取民族解放的斗志。他们在去年7月间，举行了大规模的示威游行，80％以上的工人和职员也举行了罢工，抗议法国的殖民统治。
    法国殖民者为了缓和多哥人民的斗争，于1956年8月宣布多哥为“自治共和国”，实际上是假自治之名实行殖民统治。同年10月，法国又玩弄了支持这种“自治”的所谓人民投票的把戏。但是，这种种手段骗不了人，多哥统一委员会抵制了这个“公民投票”，多哥人民继续反对“自治”，要求独立。
    去年联合国大会讨论了多哥问题，并通过了由联合国监督举行多哥立法议会选举的决议。法国原打算利用这次选举，“合法”地把多哥并入法兰西联邦，但是这个企图在多哥人民的反殖民主义斗争面前破产了。　（茂金）
