    Unexpected
    Recently, when the Indonesian government forces recovered Padang, American journalists who had been staying in the rebels' lair were in a sorry state. They rode in jeeps with white flags; they lay on the ground and ate dirt during air raids; they were exposed to the scorching sun....
    These journalists once boasted loudly about the rebels' "revolutionary cause" and "strength," bolstering the rebels' morale. Now, they are tasting the bitterness along with the rebels, perhaps this is something they did not expect!
    The Premier's Condition
    The Associated Press wrote in a recent news item: "France now needs a Premier who can restore normal relations between the United States and France...."
    What would be considered "normal relations"? This American news agency explained it with the following words: "...it is unrealistic to reject any new suggestions from the United States. Regardless of all discussions, France needs American support in its Algerian policy and elsewhere."
    The "new suggestions" referred to here are clearly the "suggestions" that Murphy revealed a few days ago about the United States wanting to interfere in the Algerian issue and replace France's position in North Africa. Murphy's suggestions aroused a chorus of curses against the United States in Paris, so the U.S. State Department hurriedly came out to deny that such a thing had happened.
    However, this "Associated Press" news item proves that the U.S. State Department's statement was just a delaying tactic to calm the anti-American wave in France. In fact, not only is this "suggestion" real, but more "new suggestions" will follow one after another. Therefore, in the eyes of the Americans, kneeling to the United States to make Franco-American "relations normal" has become a prerequisite for the new French Premier.
    Clumsy Tactics
    "If we are to guarantee that any agreement to stop the manufacture of atomic bombs is not subject to deception, each Russian atomic energy plant will need to have five hundred people stationed there." This is a statement made by Lewis Strauss, Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, on the 17th before the U.S. Senate Disarmament Subcommittee.
    People may think that this Mr. Strauss is daydreaming. Because today it is impossible to imagine any sovereign country agreeing to allow other countries to station five hundred spies in each of its atomic energy plants. In fact, Strauss did not intend for people to take his absurd opinion seriously; his purpose was only to create an excuse for the United States to refuse to stop the nuclear arms race.
    Because, just a few days ago, U.S. President Eisenhower, in order to conceal the rigid stance of the United States in refusing to stop nuclear tests, had to pretend to say that he believed "stopping the production of nuclear weapons is more important than stopping nuclear tests." However, as soon as the words were spoken, Washington could not help but worry that others would seize this little pigtail and demand a halt to nuclear weapons production. Therefore, Strauss stepped forward and quickly blocked this opening. However, because the technique was too clumsy, Strauss could not help but reveal his true colors.

    意想不到的
    最近在印度尼西亚政府军收复巴东时，一直呆在叛乱分子老巢的美国记者，狼狈不堪。他们坐上了插白旗的吉普车；在空军轰炸时伏在地上啃土；在炎炎的烈日下曝晒……。
    这些记者曾经大吹大擂地叫嚷叛乱分子的“革命事业”和“实力”，为叛乱分子壮气势。现在，他们跟着叛乱分子一起尝尝倒霉的滋味了，也许这是他们所意想不到的吧！
    总理的条件
    美联社目前在一条新闻里写道：“法国现在需要一位总理能够使美国和法国的关系恢复正常……。”
    怎样才算“关系正常”呢？这家美国通讯社用以下的话来作为解释：“……拒绝美国的任何新建议都是不现实的。不顾一切议论，法国在它的阿尔及利亚政策方面和别的地方都需要美国的支持。”
    这里所指的“新建议”，显然是墨菲前几天透露的关于美国要插手阿尔及利亚问题并取代法国在北非的地位的“建议”。墨菲的建议在巴黎激起了一片对美国的诅咒声，因而美国国务院就赶紧出来否认有这样一回事。
    但是，“美联社”的这条新闻却证明，美国国务院的声明不过是为了平息法国反美浪潮的一个缓兵之计罢了。实际上，不但这个“建议”是确实的，而且更多的“新建议”还将接踵而至。因此，在美国人眼里，向美国屈膝而使法美“关系正常”，已经成为法国新总理的必备条件了。
    笨拙的手法
    “如果要保证任何停止制造原子弹的协议不致受到欺骗的话，每个俄国原子能工厂将需要驻扎五百人”。这是美国原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯17日在美国参议院裁军小组委员会发表的声明。
    人们也许以为这位斯特劳斯先生大约是想入非非了。因为在今天不可能想像任何一个主权国家会同意让其他国家在自己的每一个原子能工厂内驻上五百名间谍。事实上，斯特劳斯本来也就并不打算让人家郑重地对待他的这种荒谬意见，他的目的不过是要为美国拒绝停止核军备竞赛制造借口罢了。
    因为，就在几天前，美国总统艾森豪威尔为了要掩饰美国拒绝停止核试验的僵硬立场，曾不得不假惺惺地说，他认为“停止核武器生产要比停止核试验更重要”。可是，话一出口，华盛顿就不免担心别人会抓住这个小辫子，要求停止核武器生产。于是，斯特劳斯就挺身而出，赶紧来堵死这个口子。然而，因为手法太笨拙，斯特劳斯就不免露出了原形。
