    Baihua Beekeeping School
    Kuang Lu'an
    The peasants of Wugang County, Hunan Province, have established a "Baihua Beekeeping School." The establishment of this school has created favorable conditions for developing beekeeping, a sideline production in mountainous areas, and for cultivating beekeeping technical talents for agricultural cooperatives. It has also solved the problem of further education and employment for some junior and senior high school graduates.
    Wugang County is located in the western mountainous area of Hunan. The county is full of flowers and fruits, and the honey source is extremely rich, which is conducive to beekeeping. Historically, farmers have had the habit of beekeeping. Agricultural cooperatives can greatly increase the income of their members through beekeeping. According to the overall plan for developing the mountain economy, the Wugang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to establish a beekeeping school by relying on the strength of the masses, and entrusted the County Committee of the Communist Youth League to lead it.
    Since the school was established last summer, the first phase has enrolled fifty-six junior and senior high school graduates. The whole school has implemented the principles of running the school diligently and thriftily and relying on the masses. It borrowed an old ancestral hall as a school building, and most of the desks and benches in the classrooms were brought by the students themselves. The state only allocated 200 yuan to purchase thirteen boxes of bee colonies. In addition to inviting experienced professional beekeepers to teach beekeeping, the County Committee of the Communist Youth League hired teachers from local middle schools and cadres from relevant business departments to give voluntary lectures. The learning method adopted a combination of classroom learning and extracurricular practice. Learning and practicing go hand in hand. For example, after learning how to collect bees, shake honey, and divide hives, they led all the students to operate in person. Within a one-year study period, the first half of the year focused on learning and practicing, and the second half of the year was entirely spent in agricultural cooperatives for practice.
    Now this school has taken shape. The school raises sixteen bee colonies. The students have basically learned the relevant beekeeping knowledge and operating skills, and will soon be distributed to agricultural cooperatives for practice. This year, the school plans to recruit two more classes, raising thirty-two bee colonies. By 1962, it will be expanded to eight classes, with a total of 480 students. Within five years, it plans to train 1,192 technical talents for mountainous agricultural cooperatives in beekeeping, rabbit breeding, and fruit tree cultivation. The local agricultural cooperatives have given great support to the establishment of this school. Many agricultural cooperatives have sent people to visit the school, and some cooperatives are now demanding that these students be assigned to their cooperatives as soon as they graduate to develop beekeeping and other agricultural and sideline production.

    百花养蜂学校
    邝麓安
    湖南武冈县农民办了一所“百花养蜂学校”。这所学校的创办，为开发山区副业生产之一的养蜂事业和培养农业社的养蜂技术人才创造了有利条件，同时也解决了部分中小学毕业生的升学和就业问题。
    武冈县在湖南西部山区，全县花果丛生，蜜源极为丰富，利于养蜂。历史上农民就有养蜂的习惯。农业社养蜂能大大增加社员收入。中共武冈县委根据开发山区经济的全面规划，决定由群众自己的力量举办一所养蜂学校，委托团县委领导。
    这所学校从去年夏天开办以后，第一期招收了五十六个中小学毕业生入学学习。全校贯彻执行了勤俭办学、群众办学的方针，借用一栋旧祠堂作为校舍，教室里的桌凳也多由学生自带，国家只拨了二百元经费购买十三箱蜂群。教师除了请当地有经验的职业养蜂者担任养蜂教学外，其他由团县委聘请当地中学校的教师和有关业务部门的干部尽义务兼课。学习的方法采取课堂学习和课外实习相结合。一边学习，一边实习。如学到取蜂、摇蜜、分箱后，就带领全体学员去亲自操作。在一年的学习期限内，上半年以边学习、边实习为主，下半年则全部到农业社里去实习。
    现在这个学校已经粗具规模。学校养殖了十六群蜂。学员们已经基本学好有关养蜂的书本知识和操作技术，即将分发农业社去实习。今年这个学校计划再招两班，养蜂三十二群，到1962年将扩充到八个班，共四百八十个学生，五年内计划将为山区农业社培养出一千一百九十二个养蜂、养兔及培植果木的技术人材。当地农业社对这个学校的开办给了很大的支持。许多农业社都派人去这个学校参观，有的社现在就要求这些学生毕业后赶快分配到他们社里去发展养蜂等农副业生产。（附图片）
