Since the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a symposium on people-run agricultural middle schools on March 17, people-run agricultural middle schools have developed significantly in just about a month. Suburban Shanghai established more than 400 agricultural middle schools in seven days. According to incomplete statistics from the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, and Liaoning, 8,000 to 9,000 agricultural middle schools have been established. Jiangsu has already opened more than 5,600 agricultural middle schools, enrolling more than 210,000 graduates of higher primary schools and members of agricultural cooperatives. Judging from the current trend, agricultural middle schools will develop greatly this year, which is an important symbol of the great leap forward in education.

Vigorously developing people-run agricultural middle schools is of great significance in meeting the strong demands of the broad masses of farmers to learn science and culture, and the demands of primary school graduates for further education. This is an important step in realizing the technological revolution in agriculture and an important aspect of the cultural revolution. At present, our country is facing a new situation of technological revolution, and the technological revolution requires the cooperation of the cultural revolution. If the cultural revolution cannot keep up, the technological revolution will be hindered. Now, the broad masses of farmers have personally realized from production that it is not enough to rely on strength to improve labor efficiency, and that culture and technology are necessary. Farmers in Henan Province have the following popular rhymes: "To achieve 'four, five, eight,' culture and technology are indispensable." "Industrialization and agriculturalization cannot be achieved without culture." These words vividly reflect the relationship between culture and production, and technological transformation. Therefore, in order to adapt to the new situation of the technological revolution, education must be greatly developed. At present, vigorously running agricultural middle schools in combination with agricultural production, absorbing a large number of graduates from higher primary schools and young people with the same cultural level into agricultural middle schools, training them to become junior and intermediate technicians with certain agricultural production knowledge, and improving the production technical knowledge of the broad masses will play an important role in reforming a series of technical problems in production.

Since liberation, China's education has developed greatly, and the number of students in schools at all levels has increased significantly. However, since the summer of 1953, the number of primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their studies has been increasing year by year. These students who cannot continue their studies have a strong desire to continue their education, and some graduates who have returned to the countryside to participate in agricultural production are also eager to continue to improve their cultural level. Many parents are also anxious about this. In the past, the Party and the government cared about these graduates, on the one hand, trying to tap the potential of existing schools to enroll more students, and on the other hand, calling on graduates who could not continue their studies to go to the labor front to participate in agricultural and industrial production, and made arrangements for them, while also organizing them to study on their own as much as possible. This was completely necessary at the time and achieved great results. However, it is undeniable that after taking the above measures, it still cannot meet the aspirations of primary school graduates to study and continue their education. Many primary school graduates are young and have difficulty participating in labor production. Moreover, with the development of agriculture, there is a demand for rural youth to have a higher cultural level. Therefore, the large-scale development of people-run agricultural middle schools will basically solve the problem of primary school graduates continuing their education, so that various places will no longer feel the impact and pressure of primary school graduates on education work, can greatly develop people-run primary schools, realize the popularization of primary school education ahead of schedule, and be more conducive to eliminating illiteracy in rural areas in a relatively short period of time, thereby promoting the upsurge of cultural and educational undertakings and also promoting the upsurge of agricultural production. Therefore, we must have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of people-run agricultural middle schools, vigorously develop people-run agricultural middle schools, and strive to ensure that every township has a middle school within three to five years.

In the past, our secondary education mainly relied on state investment to run ordinary middle schools and did not encourage the establishment of people-run vocational schools. It was as if a person only had one leg, and it would be difficult to move forward in big steps. The emergence of a large number of people-run vocational middle schools has added a leg to our secondary education. Walking on two legs can walk faster and better. Giving full play to the role of these two legs can greatly leap forward China's education. Originally, schools like agricultural middle schools had already appeared in various places. However, because some educators mistakenly believed that socialist education should only implement the so-called single-track system, that is, only run ordinary middle schools, and should not run vocational middle schools at the same time, this seriously hindered the development of education. In fact, whether it is a single track or a double track, as long as it can cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, it is socialist education, and we must run it; conversely, if the students cultivated lack socialist consciousness and do not love labor, whether it is a single track or a double track, it is bourgeois education, and we are against it.

Agricultural middle school is one of the educational forms for cultivating students' all-round development. The so-called all-round development, under the current conditions in our country, the most fundamental meaning is the combination of mental and physical labor, the combination of education and production, and the combination of education and politics, that is, the principle of cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture as Mao Zedong said. According to this spirit, under the principles that are conducive to political development and conducive to production development, we must make appropriate choices in the arrangement of disciplines, distinguish between importance and urgency, and also adapt to the time and place. The curriculum of ordinary middle schools can be different from the curriculum of vocational middle schools. In agricultural middle schools in cotton-producing areas and agricultural middle schools in rice-growing areas, there should also be differences in the curriculum of production knowledge. The school system, curriculum, and teaching plan of agricultural middle schools in various places should not be forced to be uniform.

Agricultural middle school is a major form of vocational middle school. It is welcomed by farmers and rural higher primary school graduates because this kind of school is located at the doorstep of students' homes, they can stay in production, do not increase the burden on the family, can closely combine learning and production, open up opportunities for many farmers' children from less wealthy families to attend middle school, and learn more skills to develop agricultural production. This kind of school is established on the basis of the needs and consciousness of the masses. The school buildings, funds, and teachers are solved by the masses themselves. With the large-scale establishment of agricultural middle schools, the allocation of teachers is relatively difficult. In order to solve this difficulty, on the one hand, various places must give full play to the potential of existing teachers, organize high school graduates who have not continued their studies, cadres who have been sent to lower levels, and cadres of agricultural technology extension stations to be teachers. On the other hand, they must strengthen and improve the work of normal universities, normal colleges, normal schools, and agricultural colleges, take various effective measures to quickly train teachers for agricultural middle schools, and help agricultural middle school teachers improve.

Agricultural middle schools and ordinary middle schools are both secondary education, and their common task is to cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Excellent students of agricultural middle schools can also go to higher-level schools to study and be trained to become higher-level scientific and technical cadres. However, it should also be pointed out that agricultural middle school is a vocational school, and it has different tasks from ordinary middle school. In the past, secondary education only focused on developing ordinary middle schools, and it was wrong not to run a large number of agricultural middle schools. However, when developing a large number of agricultural middle schools, it is also wrong to ignore ordinary middle schools. While developing people-run agricultural middle schools, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of ordinary middle schools, improve the teaching work of ordinary middle schools, and actively improve the quality of teaching. If this is ignored, it will have an adverse impact on the quality of universities in the future, will cause universities to lose a source of students with a higher level, and may hinder the improvement of China's cultural and scientific level. This must be noted.

Agricultural middle schools are relatively easy to establish, but it is not easy to consolidate them and gradually run them well, and a lot of work needs to be done. The central issue of consolidation is to systematically train teachers for agricultural middle schools and help existing teachers improve. At present, agricultural middle schools are adapted to the current level of agricultural production and the living standards of farmers. With the improvement of agricultural production technology and farmers' living standards, the requirements for agricultural middle schools, the content of teaching, the qualifications of teachers, and the equipment of schools will also gradually improve. Leaders should have this foresight in their thinking and should take effective measures to continuously improve the teaching level of agricultural middle schools.

Agricultural middle schools have begun to develop in some areas, but they are still not very common. The current task is to let go and mobilize the masses, and vigorously develop them in areas where conditions permit; those that have already been established should work hard to run them well.

### 大量发展民办农业中学

    大量发展民办农业中学
    自从3月17日中共江苏省委召开了民办农业中学问题座谈会以来，仅仅一个月左右的时间，民办农业中学就有了很大的发展。上海市郊区在七天中办起了四百多所农业中学。据江苏、浙江、福建、河南、辽宁五个省不完全的统计已开办农业中学八、九千所。江苏已有五千六百多所农业中学开学，招收了二十一万多名高小毕业生和农业合作社的社员入学。从现在的趋势看来，农业中学今年将有很大的发展，这是教育大跃进中的一项重要标志。
    大量发展民办农业中学，对于满足广大农民学习科学文化的强烈要求和小学毕业生升学的要求，有重大的作用。这是实现农业上的技术革命的一项重要步骤，也是文化革命的一个重要方面。目前我国正面临技术革命的新形势，技术革命需要文化革命的配合，文化革命如果跟不上去，技术革命就要受到阻碍。现在广大农民从生产中切身体会到，要提高劳动效率，光靠力气是不行的，必须要有文化和技术。河南省农民流传着这样的顺口溜：“要搞四、五、八，文化技术不能差。”“工业化、农业化，离了文化不能化。”这些话生动的反映了文化同生产、同技术改革的关系。因此，为了适应技术革命的新形势，教育事业必须大大地发展。目前大量举办与农业生产相结合的农业中学，把大量的高小毕业生和具有同等文化程度的青少年吸收到农业中学读书，把他们培养成为具有一定农业生产知识的初中级技术人员，以及提高广大群众的生产技术知识，对于改革生产上一系列的技术问题将起重要作用。
    解放以来，我国的教育事业有了极大发展，各级学校在校人数有了很大增加。但是，从1953年暑期以后，中小学毕业生不能升学的人数即年年有所增加。这些不能升学的学生升学和求学的欲望是很强烈的，有些已经回到农村参加农业生产的毕业生也迫切要求继续提高文化水平。许多学生家长也为此表示焦虑。过去，党和政府对于这些毕业生是关怀的，一方面尽可能挖掘现有学校的潜力，多招收一部分学生，另一方面号召不能升学的毕业生到劳动战线上去，参加农业和工业生产，并对他们作了安置，同时还尽可能地组织他们自学。这样做在当时是完全必要的，并且也收到了很大的效果。但是，不可否认，在采取了上述的措施之后，仍然不能满足小学毕业生的求知、升学读书的愿望。许多小学毕业生年龄较小，参加劳动生产也有困难。而且随着农业的发展，又要求农村青年有更高的文化水平。因之，大量地发展民办农业中学，将使小学毕业生的升学问题获得基本解决，因而各地就不再会感到小学毕业生对教育工作的冲击和压力，就可以大量地发展民办小学，提前实现小学教育的普及，并更有利于在较短的时间内消灭农村中的文盲，从而促进文化教育事业的高涨，也促进农业生产的高涨。因此，我们对于民办农业中学的重大意义要有足够的认识，应当大力发展民办农业中学，争取在三年到五年内做到乡乡有中学。
    过去，我们的中等教育，主要是靠国家投资举办普通中学，不鼓励创建民办的职业学校，这仿佛人身上只有一条腿，要大步前进就有困难。目前出现的大批民办职业中学，就使我们的中等教育增加了一条腿。两条腿走路，才能走得快走得好。很好地发挥这两条腿的作用，就可以使我国教育事业大大地跃进。本来，类似农业中学这样的学校在各地早已出现。但是，由于一部分教育工作者错误地认为社会主义教育只应执行所谓单轨制，即只办普通中学，而不应同时办职业中学，这就严重地阻碍了教育事业的发展。其实，不论是单轨或双轨，只要能培养出有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者，就都是社会主义的教育，我们就要办；反之，凡是培养出来的学生缺乏社会主义觉悟，不爱劳动，不论是单轨或双轨，都是资产阶级的教育，我们就都反对。
    农业中学是培养学生全面发展的教育形式之一。所谓全面发展，在当前我国的条件下，最根本的意思是脑力劳动和体力劳动结合，教育和生产结合，教育和政治结合，亦即毛主席所说的要培养有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者的原则。根据这一精神，我们在有利于政治发展和有利于生产发展的原则下，对学科的安排要进行适当的选择，要分别轻重缓急，也要因时因地制宜。普通中学的课程可以同职业中学的课程有区别。在棉产区的农业中学和水稻区的农业中学，在生产知识的课程方面，也应有所区别。各地农业中学的学制、课程、教学计划不要强求一律。
    农业中学是职业中学的一种主要形式。它受到农民和农村的高小毕业生的欢迎，因为这种学校设在学生的家门口，可以不脱离生产，不增加家庭负担，可以做到学习和生产密切的结合，为许多家境不富裕的农民子弟开辟念中学的机会，学到发展农业生产的更多的本领。这种学校是建立在群众的需要和自觉的基础上的。校舍、经费、教师等是由群众自己解决的。大量举办农业中学，师资的配备比较困难。为了解决这个困难，一方面各地要充分发挥现有师资的潜力，组织未升学的高中毕业生、下放干部和农业技术推广站的干部去做教员，另一方面，要加强和改进师范大学、师范学院、师范专科学校和农学院的工作，采取各种有效的办法，迅速培养农业中学的师资，并且帮助农业中学教师提高。
    农业中学和普通中学都是中学教育，它们的共同任务是培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。农业中学的优秀学生，也能到高一级的学校读书，培养成为更高一级的科学技术干部。但是，也应该指出，农业中学是一种职业学校，它又和普通中学担负着不同的任务。过去中学教育只注意发展普通中学，没有大量举办农业中学是不对的，但是，在大量发展农业中学的时候，如果忽视了普通中学也是不对的。必须在发展民办农业中学的同时，加强对普通中学的领导，改进普通中学的教学工作，积极提高教学质量。如果忽视这点，今后对于高等学校的质量将会发生不良影响，将使高等学校失去有较高水平的学生的来源，并可能妨碍我国文化科学水平的提高。这是必须注意的。
    农业中学创办比较容易，但是要把它巩固下来并逐步办好却并不容易，需要作很多工作。巩固的中心问题，在于有计划地培养农业中学的教师，并且帮助现有教师提高。目前农业中学是与现时农业生产水平、农民生活水平相适应的。随着农业生产技术、农民生活水平的提高，对农业中学的要求，对教学内容、教师条件、学校设备也将逐步提高。领导思想上应该有这种预见，应该采取有效的措施，不断提高农业中学的教学水平。
    农业中学在若干地区已开始有了一些发展，但是还很不普遍，当前的任务就是放手发动群众，凡是有条件的地区要大力发展；已经办起来的要努力把它办好。
