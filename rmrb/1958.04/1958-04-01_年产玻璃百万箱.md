    Annual Production of One Million Cases of Glass

    The Zhuzhou Glass Factory, the first large-scale plate glass factory completely designed by China itself, has recently begun construction in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province. The factory is scaled to produce one million standard cases of plate glass annually.

    The degree of mechanization and technical level of this factory are higher than those of existing glass factories in China, which reduces the physical labor of workers in high-temperature environments and correspondingly avoids occupational diseases for workers. The factory construction project is scheduled to be completed in the first half of 1959 and put into production at the beginning of the third quarter of 1959.

    年产玻璃百万箱
    第一座完全由我国自己设计的大型平板玻璃厂——株洲玻璃厂，已于最近在湖南省株洲市动工兴建。这个厂规模为年产平板玻璃一百万标准箱。
    这个厂机械化程度和技术水平比国内现有玻璃工厂都高，减少了工人在高温环境中的体力劳动，相应地避免了工人的职业病。建厂工程计划1959年上半年竣工，1959年第三季度初投入生产。
