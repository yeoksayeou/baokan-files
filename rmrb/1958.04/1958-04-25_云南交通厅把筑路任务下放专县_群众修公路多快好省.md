Kunming, April 24th (Reported by our newspaper) - The Yunnan Provincial Transportation Department has delegated all highway construction suitable for special districts and counties to be built by them. The funds saved by this measure will allow for the construction of over 3,000 kilometers of additional highways this year.

There were previously two different methods of highway construction in Yunnan Province.

One method was to follow regulations, with the Provincial Transportation Department's Highway Engineering Bureau organizing large numbers of long-term laborers for construction. Using this method, the province built a considerable number of highways and completed the tasks of the First Five-Year Plan. However, this required a large management organization, and a large number of laborers away from their hometowns for long periods hindered agricultural production and increased construction costs. The long-term concentration of large numbers of laborers in one place often created a strain on local material supplies.

The other method was for the local Party committee to take unified leadership, with the transportation departments providing technical guidance and assistance, mobilizing the masses to adopt a method of "people-run with public assistance" for construction in sections. Since 1956, the special districts and counties have used this method to build thousands of kilometers of highways. In the Wenshan Special District, the mobilization of the masses to build roads led to the development from highways connecting two counties to every county being connected by highways in less than half a year. Various regions divided sections, and farmers of all ethnic groups built highways in their hometowns. Cooperatives evaluated work and recorded points. People worked enthusiastically and conscientiously. In many places, the masses brought their own tools and food and worked day and night on the construction site. Not only was it done quickly and in large quantities, but the quality also met the specifications. The investment per kilometer of highway was 60% to 90% less than that of the Provincial Transportation Department. After the local Party committees took unified leadership of the road construction work, they could appropriately adjust the construction time according to the local agricultural season, resolving the contradiction between road construction work and agricultural production, and also changing the situation of strained material supplies caused by excessive concentration of population.

After summarizing the experience of various regions in building highways by following the mass line, the Yunnan Provincial Transportation Department decided that, except for some sparsely populated border ethnic minority areas or areas with a relative shortage of local labor, most of the highways originally planned to be directly built by the province would be handed over to the special districts and counties for construction. The funds saved would be allocated to the special districts and counties for use based on their different economic conditions. At the same time, the Transportation Department plans to reorganize the original four survey teams into fourteen survey groups and also transfer more than one hundred technical cadres to support the eleven special districts throughout the province. It will also organize technical forces to be responsible for the construction of larger bridges and difficult rock excavation projects in the newly built highways throughout the province. This will basically solve the problem of technical forces for road construction throughout the province.

### 云南交通厅把筑路任务下放专县  群众修公路多快好省

    云南交通厅把筑路任务下放专县
    群众修公路多快好省
    本报昆明24日电　云南省交通厅把所有适合交给专区、县修筑的公路，全部下放给各专区、县修建，由此而节省的资金，今年可以多修三千多公里公路。
    云南省的公路建设工作原来存在着两种不同的办法。
    一种是按照规章，由省交通厅公路工程局组织大批长年民工修筑。用这种办法全省曾经修筑了不少公路，完成了第一个五年计划的任务。但是，这样需要一个庞大的管理机构，同时大批民工长年离乡修路，妨碍农业生产，并且修筑的成本较高。大批民工长期集中于一地，还常常造成当地物资供应紧张的局面。
    另一种办法，是由当地党委统一领导，交通部门加以技术上的指导帮助，发动群众采取民办公助的办法分区分段修建。从1956年以来，各专区、县用这种办法兴修的公路已有数千公里。文山专区发动群众筑路，不到半年就由两县通公路发展到县县通公路。各地划分了区段，各族农民在自己的家乡兴修公路，由合作社评工记分，干得起劲、认真，许多地方的群众自带工具粮食，日夜不下工地。不但做到多、快，质量也合乎规格，一公里公路的投资比省交通厅修筑的少60％到90％。筑路工作由各地党委统一领导后，就可以根据当地农时季节适当调整施工时间，解决了筑路工作与农业生产的矛盾，也改变了由于人口过分集中而引起的物资供应紧张的状况。
    云南省交通厅总结了各地采取群众路线建设公路的经验后，决定除一些人烟稀少的边疆民族地区或当地劳动力比较缺少的地区外，把原来计划由省直接修建的公路大部分交给各专区、县修建，而把节省下来的资金，根据各地不同的经济条件，分别拨给各专区、县使用。同时，交通厅计划将原有的四个测量队改编为十四个测量组，另外再抽调一百多名技术干部，分别支援全省十一个专区，并组织技术力量负责全省新修公路中较大的桥梁和艰巨的石方工程的建筑任务。这样就基本上解决了全省筑路的技术力量问题。
