Everyone Learns Folk Songs
Yunnan Folk Song Collection Published

The first folk song collection reflecting the Great Leap Forward in rural work in Yunnan has been published in Kunming.

This collection contains thirty folk songs, mostly praising water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation. There are also songs praising the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), cadres going down to the countryside for labor, and the new atmosphere in the countryside. One folk song about water lifting sings: "Stepping on the waterwheel and singing folk songs, singing folk songs is so joyful, clear water flows in the fields, the feet on the wheel are as fast as a shuttle. The folk songs are sung with high and low notes, water wheeling is like climbing stairs, the farmers' lives are getting better and better, and tomorrow we will use water pumps." A folk song about accumulating fertilizer sings: "A small hoe is five inches long, the young man is busy accumulating fertilizer, a new toilet is built in front of the tree, and a new manure pond is dug behind the tree. A small rake is five inches long, the young girl gets up early to collect manure, the brother digs the manure pond and the sister collects manure, so that the manure pond does not have an empty stomach. A small carrying pole is five feet long, the young man is busy carrying manure, more oil makes the dishes delicious, and more manure makes the crops flourish. A small manure basket is two feet long, the brother and sister are busy carrying manure, this year we apply more fertilizer, next year we will harvest more grain."

Yunnan's folk songs have always been famous, and farmers of all ethnic groups like to use ballads to describe their labor and life. The singer Huang Hong, who is famous for singing folk songs, has performed abroad several times. Yunnan People's Publishing House has successively published five collections of Yunnan folk songs. In addition to publishing this collection, the publishing house plans to collect and publish three to four more folk song collections this year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    大家都来学民歌
    云南民歌集出版
    反映云南农村工作大跃进的第一本民歌集已在昆明出版。
    这个集子收集了三十首民歌，内容大部分是歌颂兴修水利和积肥的，也有歌唱全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）、干部下放劳动和农村新气象的。一首关于提水的民歌唱道：“脚踩水车唱山歌，唱起山歌快活多，清清海水田里淌，车上脚儿快如梭。山歌唱得有高低，车水好比上楼梯，农民生活步步高，明天要用抽水机。”关于积肥的一首山歌唱道：“小小锄头五寸长，小哥积肥忙又忙，树前修个新厕所，树后挖个新粪塘。小小钉耙五寸长，小妹拾粪早起床，哥挖粪塘妹拾粪，免得粪塘空肚肠。小小扁担五尺长，小哥挑粪忙又忙，油多炒菜菜好吃，粪多压田庄稼旺。小小粪箕二尺长，哥妹挑粪忙又忙，今年多施一挑肥，明年多打一斗粮。”
    云南的民歌素负盛名，各族农民都喜欢用歌谣形式来描述自己的劳动和生活。以善唱民歌著名的歌唱家黄虹曾数度到国外演唱。云南人民出版社已先后出版过五本云南民歌集。出版社除出版这本集子外，还计划在今年内再搜集出版三本到四本民歌集。　（新华社）
