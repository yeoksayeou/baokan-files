What to Do When There Isn't Enough Cement?
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    With only two months left before the flood season, water conservancy projects in various regions are striving to be completed before the arrival of the flood season at the end of June. In this race against the floods, people are thinking about cement day and night. Cement is one of the most important building materials for water conservancy projects, and it plays a decisive role in improving the erosion resistance of reservoirs and dams and ensuring the quality of the projects. Whether cement can be supplied in time has indeed become a very prominent issue in the current agricultural water conservancy construction projects.

    China's cement industry has developed greatly in recent years. The output in 1957 reached 6.86 million tons, which is three times the highest annual output before liberation and 9.4 times more than the output in 1949. This year, in order to support the unprecedentedly grand rural water conservancy movement, cement factories have fully developed their revolutionary zeal, and the planned targets have been increased again and again. The cement enterprises under the Ministry of Construction alone plan to produce 8.18 million tons of cement this year, an increase of 19% compared with the actual performance in 1957. However, despite this, it is still far from meeting the needs. According to incomplete statistics, the main agricultural water conservancy projects this year alone require more than 2 million tons of cement, which is more than four times the actual amount of cement used for agricultural water conservancy projects last year. As for the cement required for other basic construction projects, the amount is also extremely considerable. Obviously, these cannot be solved solely by increasing production in existing cement enterprises. In particular, agricultural water conservancy projects need to be completed before the flood season, and the need for cement is extremely urgent, so other methods must be found.

    Is there a solution? Yes, there is. Henan Province's promotion of lime-burnt clay cement is a vivid example. Taking Dengfeng County, where lime-burnt clay cement was first trial-produced, as an example, it spent more than 2,000 yuan and took only three days to build a lime-burnt clay cement plant with an annual output of about 2,000 tons. By promoting this experience, the province built nearly 100 cement plants in less than two months, with a daily output of 1,500 tons. If this continues to develop, the total output this year can reach 400,000 tons.

    This is truly a miracle! But it is not surprising at all. Indigenous methods are precisely good methods, and many things have already proven this. Lime-burnt clay cement is just another example. Look! More, faster, better, and more economical, this indigenous cement has all of these advantages. Its main raw materials are just lime and clay, resources that are not only abundant in Henan Province but also very rich in other parts of China. This provides the conditions for large-scale development; it can be more. Its equipment is simple, and its operation is convenient. Crushing can be done with iron hammers, stone rollers, or small steel mills for grinding flour, and firing can be done with kilns for burning lime or bricks and tiles. Under favorable conditions of equipment, tools, and raw materials, only a few days of preparation time are needed to produce cement, and ordinary workers who burn lime or bricks and tiles can master the production technology after a few days of learning. This allows cement to be produced at the fastest speed. This cement has good hydraulic properties and becomes stronger when it encounters water, which is perfectly suitable for use in agricultural water conservancy projects; this is better. The investment in building this "indigenous cement plant" is very small, and the cost of the product is very low. In some areas, it is even cheaper than the price of lime; this is more economical. With these four major advantages, lime-burnt clay cement will of course be welcomed.

    If Henan Province can use lime-burnt clay cement to solve the difficulty of insufficient cement for agricultural water conservancy projects, other provinces (regions) also have the same possibility. In fact, some provinces (regions) have already done so. Shandong Province has trained more than 800 cadres to go to various counties to prepare for the construction of lime-burnt clay cement plants. The lime-burnt clay cement currently produced has been applied to projects such as canals, reservoirs, ponds, and water cellars. The province has also decided to rely mainly on lime-burnt clay cement to supply the needs of water conservancy projects before the flood season. In addition, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, and other provinces are also actively promoting the work of lime-burnt clay cement. It can be seen that promoting lime-burnt clay cement or other low-grade cements manufactured by indigenous methods is an immediately effective measure to solve the difficulty of insufficient cement. Grasping this measure can turn passivity into initiative and successfully complete this year's agricultural water conservancy projects.

    It is worth noting that not everyone has a correct understanding of indigenous cement. Some cadres and peasants doubt the effectiveness of lime-burnt clay cement. In particular, some cadres always feel that cement production requires large mechanical equipment. "It is hard to believe that cement can be made from clay, stone rollers, and brick kilns." For those with such conservative ideas, on the one hand, we must educate them with facts through pilot projects, and on the other hand, we must help them liberate themselves ideologically. Thinking that cement production requires large factories and large mechanical equipment actually reflects that these comrades are still deeply bound by old ideas and look at problems with a static view, thus locking up their own hands and feet and making it impossible to move. "All roads lead to Beijing." There are many ways to produce cement. Why must it be a large factory? Small factories and factories using indigenous methods have the four major advantages of more, faster, better, and more economical and are completely in line with our construction line. Why can't they be adopted? This also proves that "politics is the commander." Even for things as beneficial as lime-burnt clay cement, it will encounter difficulties in promotion if ideological work is not done well.

    Finally, it should also be pointed out that the promotion of lime-burnt clay cement is not just a temporary measure to solve the difficulty of insufficient cement this year. It has long-term significance for the development of China's cement industry. China's policy for developing industry is to combine large, medium, and small enterprises and to combine central and local industries. The cement industry is also the same. China's construction requires a large amount of cement. We need to build some large, modern cement factories to produce high-grade cement, and we also need to build many small, simple cement factories to produce low-grade cement. This kind of small cement plant not only has immediate results, producing and supplying locally, but also has greater flexibility and can produce all year round or seasonally. It should become an important part of China's cement industry. Lime-burnt clay cement plants are precisely this kind of flexible factory. When promoting lime-burnt clay cement to solve the difficulty of insufficient cement this year, all provinces (regions) should also conduct overall planning at the same time. Provinces and cities should run some medium-sized cement plants, prefectures and counties should run some small cement plants, and townships and communes should run some low-grade cement plants that combine manual and mechanical methods. Together with the large-scale cement plants run by the central government, China's cement industry will develop by leaps and bounds, just like other industries.

    水泥不够怎么办？
    本报评论员
    离洪水季节仅仅两个月了，各个地区的水利工程都在争取6月底汛期来到前竣工。在这场同洪水赛跑的斗争中，人们日夜思念着水泥。水泥是水利工程最主要的建筑材料之一，对提高水库、水坝的抗冲刷效能，保证工程质量，有着决定性的作用。能不能及时供应水泥，确实已成为当前农田水利建设工程中一个十分突出的问题。
    我国的水泥工业这几年来有了很大的发展，1957年的产量已达六百八十六万吨，相当解放前历史最高年产量的三倍，比1949年的产量增加了九点四倍。今年，为了支援农村空前壮阔的水利运动，各个水泥工厂充分发扬了革命干劲，计划指标一再增长，仅建筑工程部所属水泥企业今年就计划生产水泥八百一十八万吨，较1957年实绩增长19％。但是，尽管如此，仍远远不能满足需要。据不完全统计，今年农田水利主要工程就需要水泥二百万吨以上，较去年实际用于兴修农田水利工程的水泥数量增加了四倍以上。至于其他基本建设工程所需要的水泥，数量也极其可观。这些，显然不是单靠现有水泥企业增加生产能够解决问题的。特别是农田水利工程要抢在汛期前完工，需要水泥十万火急，非另想办法不可。
    有没有办法呢？有的。河南省推广石灰烧粘土水泥就是一个生动的例子。拿最初试制石灰烧粘土水泥的登封县来说，花了两千多元，只用了三天的时间，就建成了一座年产两千吨左右的石灰烧粘土水泥厂。推广这个经验，全省在不到两个多月的时间里就建成了近一百个水泥厂，日产量达一千五百吨。继续发展下去，今年的产量总共可以达到四十万吨。
    这真是一个奇迹！但又丝毫也不奇怪。土办法恰是好办法，已经有许多事情证明了，石灰烧粘土水泥不过又是一例而已。请看！多快好省，这种土法水泥兼而有之。它的主要原料只不过是些石灰和粘土，这种资源不但河南省遍地皆是，在我国其他各地也都非常丰富，这就有了大量发展的条件，可以多。它的设备简单，操作方便，粉碎可以用铁锤、石碾或磨面粉的小钢磨，烧制可以用烧石灰或烧砖瓦的窑，在设备、工具和原料顺利的情况下，只需几天的准备时间就可以生产，普通烧石灰或烧砖瓦的工人经过几天时间的学习就可以掌握生产技术，这就可以以最快的速度生产出水泥来。这种水泥的水硬性很好，愈遇到水愈坚固，用在农田水利工程上恰巧合适，这是好。建设这种“土水泥厂”投资极少，而产品的成本很低，在某些地区甚至还比石灰的价钱便宜些，这是省。有此四大好处，石灰烧粘土水泥当然会受到欢迎。
    河南省可以用石灰烧粘土水泥来解决农田水利工程水泥不足的困难，其他各省（区）也完全存在同样的可能。事实上有些省（区）也已经这样做了。山东省已经训练了八百多名干部分别到各县去进行石灰烧粘土水泥厂的建厂筹备工作。目前生产出的石灰烧粘土水泥已经应用于渠道、水库、水池和水窖等工程上。这个省也已决定大部分依靠石灰烧粘土水泥，来供应汛期前水利工程的需要。此外，浙江、安徽、河北等省也在积极开展推广石灰烧粘土水泥的工作。可见推广石灰烧粘土水泥或者其他土法制造的低标号水泥，是解决水泥不足的困难的一项立竿见影的措施。抓住这个措施，就可以变被动为主动，胜利地完成今年的农田水利工程。
    值得注意的是，对于土法水泥，并不是人人都有了正确的认识的。有些干部和农民怀疑石灰烧粘土水泥的效能。特别是有些干部，总觉得生产水泥非有大的机械设备不可，“用粘土、石碾、砖窑制成水泥，很难令人相信。”对于这种有保守思想的人，一方面要通过试点，拿事实去教育他们，另一方面要从思想上帮助他们来一次解放。认为生产水泥非建大厂不可，非有大的机械设备不可，实际上反映了这些同志还深受旧思想的束缚，以一成不变的观点来看问题，因而自己把自己的手脚锁起来了，动弹不得。“条条道路通北京”，生产水泥的办法多得很，为什么非大厂不可呢？小厂、用土法制造的厂，兼有多快好省四大优点，完全合乎我们的建设路线，为什么不能采用呢？这里，也证明了“政治是统帅”，即便是像石灰烧粘土水泥这种利莫大焉的事情，如果不做好思想工作，推广起来也是会遇到困难的。
    最后，还应该指出，推广石灰烧粘土水泥并不只是解决今年水泥不足的困难的临时措施，它对于我国水泥工业的发展有着长远的意义。我国发展工业的方针是大中小相结合，中央工业和地方工业相结合。水泥工业也是如此。我国的建设需要大量的水泥，我们要建设一些大型的、现代的水泥工厂来生产高标号的水泥，也需要建设许多小型的、简单的水泥工厂来生产低标号水泥。这种小型的水泥厂不但能立见功效，就地生产，就地供应，而且具有更大的灵活性，可以全年生产，也可以季节生产。它应该成为我国水泥工业的一个重要组成部分。石灰烧粘土水泥厂正是这样一种灵活性的工厂。各省（区）在推广石灰烧粘土水泥，解决今年水泥不足的困难时，最好也能同时进行全面规划，省、市办一些中型的，专、县办一些小型的水泥厂，乡、社办一些手工和机械相结合的低标号水泥厂，再加上中央举办的大型水泥厂，那么，我国的水泥工业也会像其他工业一样，飞跃地发展起来。
