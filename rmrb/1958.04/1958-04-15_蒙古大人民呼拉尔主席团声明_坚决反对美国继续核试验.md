Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 14th: The Presidium of the Great People's Khural of Mongolia issued a statement supporting the Soviet Union's decision to cease nuclear weapons testing and the appeal from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the parliaments of all countries.

The statement, published today in the Mongolian "Unen" newspaper, said that the Presidium of the Great People's Khural of Mongolia believes that, at a time when only three countries possess nuclear weapons, an immediate cessation of nuclear weapons testing could prevent more countries from engaging in the atomic arms race, and would improve mutual understanding and trust among countries, especially among major powers. The statement said that Mongolia, as an Asian country, firmly opposes the United States' military build-up in Asia and its plans to conduct nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific Ocean.
