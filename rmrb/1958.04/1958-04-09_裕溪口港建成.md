    Yuxikou Port Completed
    China's first modern, mechanized inland river port – Yuxikou Port – has been completed and is about to be put into production.
    On the 5th and 6th, the State Yuxikou Port Project Acceptance Committee conducted a detailed inspection of all the port's projects and deemed the quality up to requirements and ready for production.
    The port's largest wharf, the coal wharf, began trial use on the 6th.
    Yuxikou Port is located on the opposite bank of Fuhu Lake in Anhui Province. It is equipped with a dedicated coal transportation railway, underground coal conveying tunnels, coal unloading pits, and coal conveying belts. After the new port is completed, the amount of coal transported from the Huainan Coal Mine via Yuxikou will increase significantly, which will greatly alleviate the transportation pressure on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. At the same time, coal transportation and loading and unloading costs can also be greatly reduced, with loading and unloading costs reduced by about two-thirds. The large amount of pit props needed by the Huainan Coal Mine can also be transshipped through this port. (According to Xinhua News Agency report)

    裕溪口港建成
    我国第一个现代化、机械化的内河港口——裕溪口港已经建成，即将投入生产。
    5日和6日，国家裕溪口港工程验收委员会，对港口的全部工程进行了详细检验，认为质量合乎要求，可以投入生产。
    6日这个港口的最大码头煤码头开始试用。
    裕溪口港在安徽省芙湖的对岸。设有运煤专用铁路、地下输煤坑道和卸煤坑、运煤皮带。新港建成以后，淮南煤矿经裕溪口运输的煤将大量增加，这样将大大减轻津浦铁路南段的运输压力；同时，煤的运输费用和装卸费用也可大大降低，其中装卸费用约可降低三分之二。淮南煤矿需要的大量坑木，也可由这个港口转运。　（据新华社讯）
