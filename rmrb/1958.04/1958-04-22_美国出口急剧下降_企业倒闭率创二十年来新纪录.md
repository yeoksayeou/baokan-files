Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st dispatch: U.S. commodity exports are shrinking. "U.S. News & World Report" reported on the 18th that the value of U.S. commodity exports in February this year fell to its lowest level in more than two years, down 18% from February last year. Exports of coal, agricultural products, automobiles, and petroleum products all fell sharply in February.

The export value in January this year had already fallen by 8% compared with December last year, a decrease of 10% compared with January last year.

The U.S. "Business Week" reported on the 12th that U.S. trade experts believe that U.S. exports for the entire year will not be able to maintain the level of January this year. The weekly also pointed out that as long as the U.S. economic recession continues, countries like Britain and Canada would rather keep the dollars in their hands than import large quantities of goods from the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st dispatch: According to Dun & Bradstreet, the U.S. had a total of 1,495 business failures in March, an increase of 21% over February. On average, sixty out of every ten thousand companies failed. This failure rate is second only to January 1939 since 1933, when seventy-two out of every ten thousand companies failed in January 1939.

The statistics office also stated that in the first quarter of this year, a total of 4,012 U.S. companies failed, compared with 3,630 in the first quarter of last year.

    美国出口急剧下降
    企业倒闭率创二十年来新纪录
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：美国商品出口正在减缩。18日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”报道说，美国今年2月份的商品出口额跌到两年多来的最低水平，比去年2月份下降了18％。煤、农产品、汽车和石油产品的输出额在2月都急剧下降了。
    今年1月份的出口额已经比去年12月份下降了8％，同去年1月份相比较减少了10％。
    美国“商业周刊”12日报道说，美国贸易专家认为，美国今年全年的出口是不能保持住今年1月的水平的。这家周刊还指出，只要美国经济衰退的局面还在继续，像英国和加拿大之类的国家是宁可把他们手中的美元保留着而不愿从美国大量进口货物的。
    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：据邓—布列德斯特里统计所20日宣布，3月份美国倒闭的企业一共有一千四百九十五家，比2月份增加了21％。在每一万家企业中，平均就有六十家倒闭。这个倒闭率是自从1933年以来仅次于1939年1月的一次，1939年1月每一万家企业中有七十二家倒闭。
    这家统计所还说，在今年第一季，美国一共有四千零十二家企业倒闭，去年第一季是三千六百三十家。
