    Radar Therapy for Mental Illness

    Recently, a mental hospital in Rome conducted trials using radar to treat mental illness. The hospital's physicians used radar to treat forty mental patients who had not responded to various treatments. The results showed that 50% of cases with severe depression and melancholia showed good results. However, no good results have yet been obtained for patients with schizophrenia, some mild mental illnesses, and Parkinson's syndrome.

    Doctors believe that the effectiveness of radar therapy is not only due to the heat-generating function of blood vessels, but also to the direct effect of microwaves on human nerve cells. Doctors say that radar therapy is harmless to the human body. (Science)

    精神病可用雷达治疗
    最近罗马一所精神病院进行了用雷达治疗精神病的试验。该病院的医师们利用雷达对四十例经过百般治疗都没有见效的精神病患者进行治疗。结果发现，在严重抑郁症和忧郁症患例中，50％收到良好效果，但是对精神分裂症和一些轻性精神病以及巴金森氏综合病症患者，现在还没有得到良好效果。
    医生们认为雷达疗法所以有效，不仅是因为血管的致热机能，而且是因为微波对人体神经细胞的直接作用。医生们说，雷达治疗对人体是无害的。（科）
