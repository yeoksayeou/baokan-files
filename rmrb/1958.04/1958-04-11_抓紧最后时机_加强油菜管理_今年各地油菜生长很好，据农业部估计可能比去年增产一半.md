Seize the Last Opportunity to Strengthen Rapeseed Management
This year, rapeseed grows very well in various regions, and the Ministry of Agriculture estimates that the yield may increase by half compared to last year.
(Our report) The more than 39 million mu of rapeseed in the southern regions are generally growing well. These rapeseeds are currently in the stage of full ridging, flowering, and pod formation. This year, rapeseed growth in many regions is better than in previous years. Jiangxi Province's more than 4 million mu of rapeseed is the best growing year since liberation. According to the province's estimate, this year's output can increase by 140% compared to last year. According to estimates from agricultural departments based on some existing information, this year's rapeseed may increase by more than 50% compared to last year. Agricultural cooperatives in various rapeseed producing areas are seizing the last opportunity to strengthen field management of rapeseed.
In the late-stage cultivation and management of rapeseed, various regions have widely promoted yield-increasing and production-protecting measures such as applying topdressing fertilizer and draining waterlogged fields. In Jiangsu, more than 90% of the rapeseed fields were topdressed with fertilizer during the flowering period. Major rapeseed producing areas such as Songjiang, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang are strengthening soil cultivation around the roots and dredging drainage ditches to prevent rapeseed lodging and waterlogging. For the small number of rapeseeds that have developed diseases, measures such as removing diseased plants have been taken to prevent the spread. Many areas in Hunan are carrying out ditch clearing work, widening small ditches, deepening shallow ditches, and dredging collapsed and blocked ditches to ensure smooth drainage and dry soil. The old attitude that used to prevail in many areas, "a rapeseed flower, it doesn't grow on it," "harvest if there is any, discard if there isn't any," has been replaced by actions to strengthen cultivation and strive for a bumper harvest.
In the past, some places had the habit of turning over too much rapeseed as green manure, but this year they have also changed. Spring plowing and agricultural inspection teams in various regions have also inspected this situation. According to the inspection team sent by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in Xianning, of the county's 100,000 mu of rapeseed, it was originally planned to only harvest 20,000 mu, and the rest were intended to be used as green manure. Later, after calculation, as long as we continue to process and cultivate, the 80,000 mu originally planned for fertilizer can yield an average of 40 jin of seeds per mu, for a total of 3.2 million jin of rapeseed, which is 1.2 million jin more rapeseed than originally planned, which can increase rapeseed oil by more than 370,000 jin and oil cake by more than 800,000 jin. Through such calculations, everyone understood that in the past, using rapeseed as green manure was truly not worth the loss. The Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture also calculated the accounts: If one mu of rapeseed is slightly cultivated, it can harvest 40 to 50 jin of rapeseed, equivalent to 100 to 150 jin of rice, and can also obtain 30 jin of dried cake and more than 1,000 jin of straw. Some agricultural cooperatives here have launched discussions on this issue. The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Hengnan County has taken specific measures to reverse the phenomenon of members blindly plowing away rapeseed, making everyone realize that keeping more rapeseed is a good thing that "benefits the country and benefits oneself."
Some areas have immediately organized forces to eliminate diseases and insect pests after they were discovered in rapeseed. Wheat spiders in Fuyang Prefecture, Anhui, and wireworms in Shouxian County, Liuan Prefecture, were subjected to large-scale control after being discovered. Many areas have paid special attention to the cold protection of summer crops such as rapeseed in response to the frequent cold air intrusions this spring. Agricultural cooperatives in some areas of Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and other provinces have established special cold protection organizations, ready to fight against incoming cold waves at all times.

    抓紧最后时机　加强油菜管理
    今年各地油菜生长很好，据农业部估计可能比去年增产一半
    本报讯　南方地区的三千九百多万亩油菜，一般生长良好。这些油菜目前正在满垅封行，盛花结荚阶段。今年不少地区的油菜生长好于往年。江西省四百多万亩油菜是解放后生长最好的一年。据这个省估计，今年产量可比去年增产140％。据农业部门从现有的一些情况估计，今年的油菜可能比去年增产50％以上。各油菜产区的农业社正在抓紧最后时机，加强油菜的田间管理。
    在油菜的后期培育管理中，各地比较普遍地推行了加施追肥和排除渍水等增产保产措施。江苏在油菜开花时期有90％以上的油菜田追施了肥料；油菜重点产区松江、苏州、镇江等地，正加强培土壅根和疏通墒沟，以防止油菜倒伏、受涝。对少数发生了病害的油菜，已采取了拔除病株等防止蔓延的措施。湖南许多地区正在进行清沟工作，沟小的加开，沟浅的加深，崩塌阻塞的加以疏通，使畦沟通畅，田土干爽。过去不少地区流行着的“油菜一朵花，长不长在它”，“有就收，无就丢”的老态度，已经被加强培育，争取丰收的行动所代替了。
    过去有些地方有过多地翻耕油菜作绿肥的习惯，今年也都改变了。各地春耕和农业检查团，也对这种情况进行了检查。据中共湖北省委派出的检查团在咸宁了解，全县十万亩油菜中，原只计划保收两万亩，其余的都打算作绿肥。后来经过算账，只要继续加工培育，原计划沤肥的八万亩以平均亩产四十斤籽计算，共可收三百二十万斤菜籽，比原计划可多收菜籽一百二十万斤，可增加菜油三十七万多斤、油饼八十多万斤。通过这样算账，大家明白了过去把油菜沤绿肥是真正的得不偿失。湖南农业厅也算了一笔账：一亩油菜如果稍加培育可收菜籽四、五十斤，折合稻谷一百到一百五十斤，而且还可以得三十来斤枯饼、一千多斤藁秆。这里的一些农业社都就这个问题展开讨论，衡南县和平农业社，已采取具体措施，扭转了社员中盲目犁掉油菜的现象，使大家认识了多留油菜是“功在国家、利在自己”的好事。
    有些地区在油菜发现病虫以后立即组织力量加以扑灭。安徽阜阳专区的麦蜘蛛，六安专区寿县的金针虫，在被发现以后就进行了大规模防治。许多地区针对今年春季冷空气侵袭频繁的情况，特别注意了油菜等夏熟作物的防寒工作。安徽、湖南、湖北、江苏等省的一些地区的农业社都建立专责的防寒组织，时刻准备着迎击来袭的寒潮。
