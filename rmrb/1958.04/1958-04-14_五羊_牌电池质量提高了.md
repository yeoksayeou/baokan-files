    "Five Rams" Brand Battery Quality Improved

    On March 6th, the People's Daily published Comrade He Luheng's letter criticizing our factory's "Five Rams" brand battery as "a flash in the pan." We sincerely accept this criticism. In order to rapidly improve the quality of the "Five Rams" brand battery, all employees of our factory, after three days of hard work, finally came up with an effective solution on March 21st, increasing the battery's original white light time from 600 minutes to 915 minutes, and the quality has reached an excellent level.

    “五羊”牌电池质量提高了
    3月6日人民日报发表贺陆恒同志的来信，批评我厂出品的“五羊”牌电池是“一夜红光”。我们诚恳接受这一批评。为了迅速提高“五羊”牌电池的质量，我厂全体职工经过三天的苦战，终于在3月21日想出有效办法，把电池由原有白光时间六百分钟提高到九百十五分钟，质量已经达到优良水平。	广州市公私合营兴华电池厂
