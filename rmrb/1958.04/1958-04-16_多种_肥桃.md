Things from All Around

　　Shangli Township, Feicheng County, Shandong Province, which is rich in fat peaches, plans to plant an additional 400,000 peach trees this spring, and requires a concentrated effort to complete this by April 10. By the end of March, nearly 300,000 trees had already been planted throughout the township. The farmers happily said, "In two or three years, this place will become a large peach orchard." People also suggested to the Township People's Committee that Shangli Township be renamed "Peach Orchard Township." (Liang Chao)

    多种“肥桃”
    盛产肥桃的山东肥城县尚里乡，计划今春增植桃树四十万株，并要求于4月10日前突击完成。到3月底全乡就已栽好近三十万株。农民们高兴的说：“两三年以后，咱这里就成为一个大桃园了。”人们还建议乡人委，将尚里乡改为“桃园乡”。　（梁超）
