    "Steady Evolution"
    When U.S. Under Secretary of State for Administration Julius C. Holmes mentioned the U.S. intention to increase economic "aid" to Central African countries, he said this was a method the U.S. must use to help nationalism develop according to the principle of "steady evolution."
    What exactly does Holmes mean by "steady evolution"? Please see his annotations: The so-called "steady" means that "the United States does not want to take the place of any European country in Africa"; the so-called "evolution" means "not wanting to promote immature independence movements there." In fact, the first sentence is precisely "a guilty conscience needs no accuser." Central African countries are the territories of old colonial powers such as Britain. The United States infiltrates through "aid," naturally wanting to replace them. As for the second sentence, it is easier to understand, that is, "immaturity" can be used as an excuse at any time to oppose national independence movements. In short, suppressing national independence movements on the one hand and squeezing out old colonial countries on the other – this is America's "steady evolution"!

### “稳健的进化”

    “稳健的进化”
    美国国务卿特别助理朱利叶斯·克·霍姆斯在提到美国打算增加对中非各国的经济“援助”时，说这是美国必须用来帮助民族主义按照“稳健的进化”方针发展的一个办法。
    霍姆斯所讲的“稳健的进化”究竟是什么意思呢？请看他的注解：所谓“稳健”就是“美国不想在非洲取任何欧洲国家的地位而代之”；所谓“进化”则是“不想促进那里的不成熟的独立运动”。其实，第一句话恰恰是“此地无银三百两”。中非各国为英国等老牌殖民者的地盘，美国以
  “援助”手段渗入，自然是要取而代之。至于第二句是比较容易明白的，那就是随时可用“不成熟”为借口，反对民族独立运动。总之，一手镇压民族独立运动，一手排挤老牌殖民国家，这就是美国的“稳健的进化”！
