Guizhou Farmers Show Great Enthusiasm
——Average Accumulation of 14,000 Catties of Fertilizer Per Mu

(Reported by this newspaper) Guizhou Province's fertilizer accumulation campaign is leaping forward at a rapid pace. As of March 22nd, the province had accumulated a total of 463,861,100,000 catties of various natural fertilizers, averaging 14,811 catties per mu of land. Shiqian County accumulated the most fertilizer, averaging 77,620 catties per mu; Taijiang, Leishan, and Jinsha Counties averaged 40,000 to 60,000 catties per mu; Jianhe, Tongren, and Suiyang averaged over 30,000 catties per mu; and another eighteen counties, including Shuicheng and Xingyi, averaged over 20,000 catties per mu.

The quality of the accumulated fertilizer is generally higher than in previous years. In the Bijie area, penned manure and compost account for about 60%; in the Southeast Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture, penned manure accounts for 30% and compost for 50%; and in Weng'an County, compost and penned manure also account for about 50%.

The main reasons for the high quantity, speed, and quality of fertilizer accumulation are that the broad masses of farmers and cadres, during the rectification and commune consolidation movements, resolutely criticized right-leaning conservative thinking, greatly raised their socialist awareness, universally launched a "catch up with the advanced, compare enthusiasm" upsurge, and vigorously launched a concentrated fertilizer accumulation drive. In late February, Hezhang County launched a concentrated fertilizer accumulation campaign, with an attendance rate of over 85%. In about twenty days, the amount of fertilizer accumulated increased from 5,934 catties per mu to 22,925 catties per mu. Libo County plans to apply 50,000 catties of fertilizer per mu, and 81.6% of the county's labor force is engaged in night battles. Chengguan Town in Anshun County worked hard for several days and nights, accumulating more than 70 million catties of fertilizer. During the campaign, the masses of farmers not only displayed their production enthusiasm but also found a large number of fertilizer sources; Libo and Weng'an Counties alone have found more than fifty types of fertilizer sources. Jiangkou County summarized the masses' fertilizer accumulation experience and vigorously promoted smoked soil fertilizer, paddy field fertilizer, and heated earth fertilizer. Currently, 80% of the households in the county have adopted these methods, and heated earth fertilizer alone can accumulate 30,000 catties per household per year.

However, Qingle County in the Anshun area, Congjiang County in the Southeast Guizhou Autonomous Prefecture, and Ceheng County in the Qiannan Autonomous Prefecture have accumulated relatively little fertilizer and are continuing to catch up rapidly and vigorously launch a concentrated fertilizer accumulation drive.

    贵州农民干劲高
    ——每亩平均积肥一万四
    本报讯　贵州省积肥运动飞速跃进。到3月22日止，全省共积各种自然肥料四千六百三十八亿六千一百多万斤，平均每亩地积肥一万四千八百一十一斤。积肥数量最多的施秉县，平均每亩达七万七千六百二十斤；台江、雷山、金沙县平均每亩四至六万多斤；剑河、铜仁、绥阳平均每亩三万斤以上；另有水城、兴义等十八个县平均每亩都超过了两万斤。
    已积制的肥料的质量，一般也都比往年高。毕节专区圈肥、堆肥的数量占60％左右；黔东南自治州圈肥占30％、堆肥占50％；瓮安县的堆肥、圈肥也约占50％。
    积肥多、快、好的主要原因，是广大农民群众和干部在整风和整社运动中，坚决批判了右倾保守思想，大大提高了社会主义觉悟，普遍掀起了“赶先进、比干劲”的热潮，大力突击积肥。赫章县2月下旬开展突击积肥运动，出勤率达85％以上，二十天左右，积肥数字由每亩五千九百三十四斤上升到二万二千九百二十五斤。荔波县计划每亩施肥五万斤，全县81.6％的劳力都投入夜战。安顺县城关镇苦战几昼夜，积肥七千多万斤。在运动中，农民群众不仅发挥生产积极性，找出了大量肥源，仅荔波、瓮安等县就已找出五十多种肥源。江口县总结群众积肥经验，大力推广熏土肥、泡田肥、炕土肥，目前全县80％的户都已推广，仅炕土肥一项，每户每年可积三万斤。
    但是安顺专区晴隆县黔东南自治州从江县、黔南自治州册亨等县积肥数量较少，正在继续急起直追，大力突击积肥。
