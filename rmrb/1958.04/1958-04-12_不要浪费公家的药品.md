    Reader's words:

    Don't Waste Public Medicines
    In recent years, some comrades who enjoy public medical care go to the hospital to see a doctor and do not follow the doctor's diagnosis. They specify what kind of medicine they want. Some take too much and can't finish it, so it accumulates. Even more, some simply don't take the medicine after taking it home and throw it away casually. As a result, many units can find some expired medicines from windowsills and drawers every time they have a major cleaning. I don't think this is a trivial matter, because this phenomenon of wasting public medicines exists in many units. I suggest that the health department study this issue, and at the same time, I hope that relevant comrades will consciously cherish public medicines. Guo Yulin

    不要浪费公家的药品
    近几年来，有些享受公费医疗的同志到医院看病，不遵照医生的诊断，自己指名要这样或那样的药，有的要多了吃不了，就积压起来。更有的把药拿回家后干脆不吃，随便乱扔，因而很多单位每逢大扫除，都可以从窗台上和抽屉里找出一些已经失效的药品。我认为这不是一件微不足道的小事，因为这种浪费公家药品的现象在许多单位都存在。我建议卫生部门研究这个问题，同时希望有关同志自觉地爱护公家的药品。　郭玉麟
