Xinhua News Agency, 7th April: The CCP Central Committee and the State Council issued a directive on large-scale afforestation throughout the country on April 7th. The full text is as follows:

    The rapid and large-scale development of afforestation is of great significance for promoting the transformation of China's natural and economic landscape. China's existing forest resources are insufficient, with a timber reserve of only about 6 billion cubic meters and a forest cover of only slightly more than 10 percent, concentrated in a few areas. Insufficient forests and extremely uneven distribution not only hinder the development of basic construction undertakings and restrict the development of the timber fiber industry, forest chemical industry, and various forestry specialty and sideline productions in forest areas, but also, in many places, the existence of large areas of barren mountains and bald ridges causes serious soil erosion and waterlogging, wind, and sand disasters, greatly affecting the development of agricultural production. Since liberation, afforestation has made great achievements over the years, especially in 1956, but it is still far from meeting the needs of the people and the country. At present, industry and agriculture across the country are advancing by leaps and bounds, and the afforestation movement is also advancing unprecedentedly rapidly. Once people realize that afforestation has great benefits and that not afforesting has great disadvantages, and once they realize that there are no insurmountable difficulties in afforestation, their enthusiasm will be endless. In this year alone, as of the end of March, 170 million mu of afforestation has been completed nationwide, equivalent to 110 percent of the amount completed during the First Five-Year Plan period. Many provinces and cities have set out plans to basically complete greening in about five years. This situation shows that the requirement put forward in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) to green all possible barren land and barren hills within twelve years and plant trees beside houses, villages, roads, and waterways is not only completely achievable, but can also be achieved ahead of schedule, and that skepticism and conservatism are unfounded. However, it should be pointed out that in some places, the masses' understanding and confidence in afforestation are still insufficient, their enthusiasm is not great, and their methods are not many; in particular, they often only pay attention to afforestation and not to forest cultivation and regeneration of harvested areas, so that they plant a lot, but few survive, and growth is slow, or they cut a lot, but plant little, and plant slowly. Some leading organs have not yet made great efforts to reverse this situation, or lack comprehensive planning and correct guidelines for afforestation, and therefore cannot fully and effectively mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. In order to quickly overcome these shortcomings, to promote the universal and planned development of the afforestation movement, and to change the situation of insufficient forests and extremely uneven distribution in our country in as short a time as possible, the CCP Central Committee and the State Council now issue the following instructions:

    (1) Planning must be done well. In order to transform nature, conserve soil and water, conquer waterlogging and drought disasters, and massively develop basic construction and various forest product industries, and in order to improve the lives of farmers, especially those in mountainous areas, the national forest area should be doubled in ten years, that is, from more than 100 million hectares (1.5 billion mu) to more than 200 million hectares (3 billion mu), so that the national average forest cover rate increases from more than 10 percent to more than 20 percent. The national timber reserves should increase to about 8 billion cubic meters in fifteen years, that is, an increase of one-third. Various forest products such as fruits, dried fruits, mulberry leaves, tea, oil, and gum should also have huge increases.

    When formulating afforestation plans, the development plans for agriculture and animal husbandry should also be considered. The development and management of forestry should be appropriately combined with the development and management of agriculture and animal husbandry according to local conditions.

    Each province and autonomous region must formulate different afforestation speeds according to local conditions. The Northwest and North China are the regions with the least forests and the most serious soil erosion, and they must overcome all difficulties and vigorously carry out afforestation. However, it is estimated that some provinces and autonomous regions have too sparse populations or too little suitable land for afforestation, making it difficult to achieve a forest cover rate of 20 percent. Therefore, all provinces and autonomous regions with better conditions must strive to achieve a forest cover rate of more than 30 percent to more than 40 percent respectively, and strive to achieve this ahead of schedule. All provinces and autonomous regions should formulate plans to vigorously develop timber and forest products. Provinces and autonomous regions that cannot supply themselves with timber should strive to be self-sufficient in a few years and supply the needs of national construction and foreign trade with a large amount of timber and forest products. In plain villages and all cities without barren land or barren hills, the masses must be mobilized to plant trees extensively in the "four sides" (beside houses, villages, roads, and waterways), and strive to create contiguous areas and belts as an important part of the overall afforestation plan.

    In addition to paying attention to area and speed, afforestation plans should also pay attention to the combination of tree species. We must take into account the diverse needs of national construction and the people's lives, and determine the appropriate proportions of timber forests (including papermaking raw materials), fuel wood forests, other economic forests (fruit and nut forests, oil forests, etc.), and various protection forests (soil and water conservation forests, sand prevention forests, windbreak forests, coastal defense forests, etc.) according to natural conditions. In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses for afforestation and develop the production of various forest products, the masses should be encouraged to develop various economic forests in large quantities. The past bias of one-sidedly requiring the masses to plant more timber forests and neglecting economic forests should be corrected. In order to ensure the supply of timber, state-owned forest farms should focus on the construction of timber forests, while also combining diversified operations and agroforestry intercropping, so that the proportion of timber forests in the total afforestation area managed by state-owned and cooperative farms is not less than 60 percent.

    In order to increase forest cover and supply national and civilian needs as soon as possible, we must focus on developing fast-growing tree species such as poplar, locust, eucalyptus, paulownia, willow, chinaberry, and ailanthus in the selection of tree species. It was wrong to not pay enough attention to this issue in the past. Bamboo forests are developing rapidly, and bamboo is widely used in construction and other fields. Therefore, all places with conditions should actively promote the construction of bamboo forests.

    In all areas suitable for the growth of precious coniferous and broad-leaved tree species, attention should be paid to actively developing precious timber tree species.

    In all barren lands and barren hills that need and are suitable for planting grass, planting grass should be included in the greening plan. Planting grass can not only conserve soil and water and improve the soil, but also generate income in the same year or the second year, so it should be vigorously promoted.

    (2) We must do a good job of ideological mobilization among the masses and adhere to the policy of relying mainly on cooperatives for afforestation, while actively developing state-owned forest farms.

    As mentioned above, the task of afforestation in the current and coming decade is great and arduous, and it can only be completed by thoroughly relying on the leadership of party organizations at all levels and relying on the hard work of the broad masses. The key here is to summarize past afforestation experiences and conscientiously carry out ideological mobilization work, focusing on the ideological state of the masses. We must adopt all effective methods, such as cadre meetings, labor model and activist meetings, mass meetings, youth meetings, debates, accounting, visits, competitions, etc., to widely publicize the urgent need, multiple benefits, and successful experiences of afforestation to the broad masses, commend advanced individuals and advanced units, correct erroneous ideas and erroneous methods, unify understanding, boost confidence, and set off a high tide of afforestation and tree planting.

    Since afforestation relies on the strength of the masses, each province, autonomous region, prefecture, city, county, township, and cooperative must plan and be responsible at each level. For afforestation of barren mountains, rivers, and roads that cross counties, prefectures, or even provinces, the relevant counties, prefectures, and provinces should jointly plan and cooperate. All areas with manpower should also mobilize the masses to go to neighboring areas with sparse populations to settle and carry out afforestation. The land that needs to be afforested in each area must be divided into sections and plots, and contracted to each level to the end, including planting, survival, replanting, growth, and protection. Afforestation can be carried out by various methods such as planting seedlings, sowing, or cutting; in places where it is necessary and possible to use machinery for plowing and sowing, mechanized afforestation can also be promoted. Cooperatives' afforestation should be carried out with the cooperative planting and owning the trees, and the cooperative should also be responsible for collecting and preparing tree seeds and seedlings, and should try to collect seeds locally, cultivate seedlings locally, and have everyone collect seeds and every cooperative cultivate seedlings. If some cooperatives really cannot solve the problem of tree seeds and seedlings, the state can provide assistance as much as possible, or the state and the cooperative can cooperate in management. If the state finds it inconvenient to carry out afforestation and forest protection along transportation lines and rivers, around large reservoirs, and around mines, it can also be assigned to nearby cooperatives to carry out afforestation according to certain specifications. In short, it is necessary to mobilize the vast manpower of cooperatives across the country to quickly realize the afforestation plan. Each county should focus on the afforestation plan of each township and each cooperative, and put forward the goals of establishing afforestation cooperatives of 1,000 mu, 5,000 mu, or 10,000 mu, or tree-planting cooperatives of 10,000 trees, 100,000 trees, or 1 million trees according to the conditions of whether there is barren land or barren hills, organize competitions, and conduct evaluations on time. The masses should also be organized and encouraged to plant trees beside their houses, implement self-planting and self-ownership, and formulate plans for tree-planting households of ten trees and one hundred trees, so as to quickly green all urban and rural areas.

    While focusing on relying on the masses for afforestation, we must actively develop state-owned afforestation. In addition to strengthening existing state-owned forest farms, we should also use state-owned and cooperative-owned barren land and barren hills that are unable to be managed to organize transferred manpower to build new forest farms in a planned way. State-owned forest farms should focus on afforestation and forest management, while also appropriately combining diversified operations (such as agroforestry intercropping, management of forest areas, and mountainous area sideline industries) in order to reduce costs and increase income. State-owned forest farms must vigorously improve their management and improve the quality of afforestation, gradually expand the scope of forest management, and conscientiously learn, summarize, and improve the advanced experiences of forest farmers in various places, and give full assistance and guidance to cooperatives in technical guidance, scientific experiments, seed collection, seed selection, seedling cultivation, and cultivation of improved varieties. Party committees at all levels should conscientiously strengthen their leadership over state-owned forest farms, strengthen the cadre force of the forest farms, promote diligence and thrift in running enterprises among the cadres, launch a struggle against waste and conservatism, and strive to make these forest farms become important bases for supplying the country with timber, and play a leading role in the nationwide afforestation cause.

    (3) We must strive to improve the quality of afforestation, do a good job of preparing before afforestation and cultivating forests after afforestation.

    Afforestation not only requires quantity and speed, but also must be good and economical, and must be planted densely, survive a lot, and grow fast, avoiding the phenomenon that some places in the past wasted manpower and materials but did not achieve much. To this end, preparations must be made before afforestation. We must mobilize the masses to collect and prepare enough tree seeds and seedlings in every possible way, and pay attention to protecting nurseries, seed stands, and scattered mother trees. We must summarize the advanced experience of the local area, and use methods such as training and teaching, visits and demonstrations to enable the masses to learn the techniques of selecting tree species, identifying seedlings, preparing land, planting, tending, and protecting. In the Northwest, North China, and other arid areas, it is especially necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses to do a good job of water storage and soil conservation in the spirit of hard work: flat land should be well prepared, mountain land should be dug with fish scale pits and horizontal ditches, and water and soil should be sent to the mountains for mountain tops that lack water and soil. Afforestation must ensure a certain density (timber forests generally require 6,000 to 12,000 trees per hectare, that is, 400 to 800 trees per 10 mu; economic forests, fuel wood forests, and protection forests should also specify different densities according to specific conditions), ensure that the survival rate reaches more than 80 percent, and check the survival situation on time and replenish missing seedlings in time.

    In order to ensure the quality of afforestation and develop forest area production, permanent and diversified forest professional teams should be established in all cooperatives with large afforestation tasks, so as to solve the necessary fixed labor force for forestry production, master farming time, improve and popularize forestry technology, and improve labor efficiency and forestry income.

    (4) We must do a good job of regeneration and forest protection.

    In the past, large-area logging was carried out in some forests in our country, and the harvested areas were dependent on natural regeneration. This method is not suitable for the specific conditions of our country and must be completely corrected. We must implement small-area logging and a policy of artificial regeneration as the main method, artificial promotion of natural regeneration, or natural regeneration as an auxiliary method, so that the speed of regeneration exceeds logging. We should plant two to three trees for every tree felled, and plant them in the same year as felling or the following year. Harvested areas that have not been regenerated in the past few years must be regenerated completely in the near future. In order to ensure the combination of logging and regeneration, logging and forest management agencies should be merged from the central to the grassroots level.

    Forest fire prevention has improved in recent years, but it must continue to be greatly strengthened. The masses should be organized, areas should be divided, forest protection conventions should be formulated, and the idea that "everyone is responsible for forest fire prevention" should be promoted, and a mass movement to prevent forest fires should be launched. Cooperatives should strengthen the management of forests within the cooperative and establish the necessary responsibility system; for the forests of members that have not yet joined the cooperative, they should strive to join the cooperative as soon as possible for protection. State-owned forest areas should also combine the strength of the masses to strengthen forest fire prevention facilities.

    The CCP Central Committee and the State Council believe that as long as the above measures are conscientiously taken and a mass afforestation movement involving thousands of troops and horses is vigorously launched, China's green area and forest resources can be greatly increased after several years of hard work, which will bring great benefits to China's industry, agriculture, and people's lives.

    Ten years depends on three years, and three years depends on the first year. As long as we strive to afforest an average of 200 to 300 million mu per year nationwide within three years from this year, and ensure that planting survives and grows, we will be able to complete the ten-year afforestation task greatly ahead of schedule. There are still more than eight months this year, and cooperatives, state-owned forest farms, and urban and rural residents can plant a lot of forests, trees, and grass. This year, in particular, we must prepare a large number of tree seeds, seedlings, grass seeds, and technical conditions for next year and the year after, so that we can develop the afforestation cause more, faster, better, and more economically next year and the year after. The CCP Central Committee and the State Council call on party committees at all levels, people's committees at all levels, all party members, communist youth league members, and all people to mobilize together, summon up revolutionary vigor, and step up afforestation; do not miss a day in the time when afforestation is possible, and seize the opportunity to check the afforestation situation and survival and maintenance; strive to lay the foundation for large-scale afforestation this year, and strive to double the total forest area of the country in ten years or less.

    中共中央　国务院发布指示
    在全国大规模造林
    新华社7日讯　中共中央、国务院于四月七日发布关于在全国大规模造林的指示。全文如下：
    迅速地大规模地发展造林事业，对于促进我国自然面貌和经济面貌的改变，具有重大的意义。我国现有的森林资源不足，木材蓄积量只有六十亿立方公尺左右，森林覆盖率只稍多于百分之十，而且集中在少数地区。森林不足和分布极不平衡，不但妨碍了基本建设事业的发展，限制了木材纤维工业、林产化学工业和各种林业特产、林区副业生产的发展，而且很多地方由于光山秃岭大量存在，水土流失和水旱风沙灾害严重，大大影响了农业生产的发展。解放以来，历年特别是一九五六年的造林事业是有很大成绩的，但是还远不能满足人民和国家的需要。目前全国工农业都在突飞猛进，造林运动也在空前迅速地前进。人们一旦认识了造林确有很大利益，不造林确有很大不利，认识了造林并没有不可克服的困难，他们的干劲就是无穷的了。仅仅今年截至三月底止，全国已经造林一亿七千万亩，相当于第一个五年计划期间完成数的百分之一百一十。不少省市已经定出规划，争取在五年左右基本上完成绿化。这个情况表明，全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中所提出的十二年绿化一切可能绿化的荒地荒山和在宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁植树的要求，不但完全可以实现，而且可以提前实现，怀疑和保守的思想是没有根据的。但是应该指出，也有一些地方，群众对于造林的认识和信心还不足，劲头还不大，办法还不多；特别是往往只重视造林，而不重视育林和迹地更新，以至种得多，活得少，长得慢，或者伐得多，种得少，种得慢。有一些领导机关，对于这种情况，还没有用大力加以扭转，或者缺乏造林的全面规划和正确方针，因而还不能充分有效地发挥群众的积极性。为了迅速克服这些缺点，使造林运动得到普遍地、有计划地发展，在尽可能短的时期内改变我国森林不足和分布极不平衡的状况，中共中央和国务院现作如下指示：
      （一）必须作好规划。为了改造自然、保持水土、征服水旱灾害，为了大规模地发展基本建设和各种林产品工业，为了改善农民生活特别是山区农民生活，全国森林面积应该在十年内翻一翻。即由一亿公顷（十五亿市亩）以上增加到二亿公顷（三十亿市亩）以上，使全国平均的森林覆盖率由百分之十以上增加到百分之二十以上。全国的木材蓄积量，在十五年内应该增加到八十亿立方公尺左右，即增加三分之一。各种水果、干果、桑叶、茶叶、油料、树胶等林产品，也都应该有巨大的增长。
    在制定造林规划的时候，应该同时考虑到农业和畜牧业的发展规划。应该根据当地的条件，使林业的发展和经营同农业、畜牧业的发展和经营适当地结合起来。
    各省、自治区必须因地制宜，规定不同的造林速度。西北、华北是森林最少、水土流失最严重的地区，必须排除万难，大力造林。但是估计到有些省、自治区人口太稀，或者宜林地太少，森林覆盖率难于达到百分之二十。因此，一切条件较好的省、自治区，必须争取森林覆盖率分别达到百分之三十以上——百分之四十以上，并且力争提前实现。各省、自治区都应该订出大力发展木材和林产品的规划，现在木材不能自给的省、自治区，应该争取在若干年以后能够自给，并且用大量的木材和林产品供应国家建设和对外贸易的需要。在没有荒地荒山的平原村落地区和一切城市，必须发动群众普遍在“四旁”植树，争取做到成片成带，作为整个造林规划的一个重要组成部分。
    造林规划除了要注意面积和速度，还要注意树种的搭配。必须兼顾国家建设和群众生活的多种需要，按照自然条件，定出用材林（包括造纸原料）、薪炭林、其他经济林（果木林、油料林等）、各种防护林（水土保持林、防沙林、防风林、海防林等）的适当比例。为了发动群众造林的积极性，发展各种林产品的生产，应该鼓励群众大量发展各种经济林。过去一个时期片面地要求群众多造用材林而忽视经济林的偏向，应该纠正。为了保证木材的供应，国营林场应该以营造用材林为主，兼顾多种经营和林农间作，使全国的用材林在国营和合作社营的造林总面积中，所占的比例不少于百分之六十。
    为了尽快地增加森林覆盖率和供应国需民用，在树种的选择上必须着重发展杨树、洋槐、桉树、泡桐、柳树、苦栋、臭椿等速生树种，过去在这个问题上注意不够是错误的。竹林发展很快，而竹材在建筑和其他方面用途很广。因此，凡是有条件的地方，都应该积极推广营造竹林。
    在一切适宜珍贵针阔叶树种生长的地区，应该注意积极发展珍贵用材树种。
    在一切需要和适宜种草的荒地荒山，应该把种草列入绿化规划。种草不但可以保持水土，改良土壤，而且可以在当年或者第二年就有收益，应该大力提倡。
      （二）必须在群众中作好思想动员，并且坚持依靠合作社造林为主，同时积极发展国营林场的方针。
    如上所说，当前和今后十年内造林的任务是伟大的，艰巨的，只有彻底地依靠各级党组织的领导，依靠广大群众的艰苦奋斗，才能够完成。这里的关键，就是针对群众的思想状态，总结过去的造林经验，认真作好思想动员工作。必须采取一切有效的方式，例如干部大会、劳动模范和积极分子大会、群众大会、青少年大会、辩论、算账、参观、竞赛等等，向广大群众广泛地宣传造林的迫切需要、多种利益和成功经验，表扬先进人物和先进单位，纠正错误思想和错误办法，统一认识，鼓舞信心，掀起造林植树的热潮。
    造林既然依靠群众的力量，因此，各省、自治区、专区、城市、县、乡、合作社必须层层规划，层层负责。对于那些跨县、跨专区以至跨省的荒山河流道路的造林，各有关的县、专区和省应该共同规划，协作进行。一切有人力的地区还应该动员群众到人口稀少的邻近地区去安庄造林。每个地区需要造林的地面，都必须分段划片，层层包干到底，包种、包活、包补苗、包长大、包保护。造林可以采取植苗、播种或者插条等各种方法进行；在需要和可能利用机械翻地播种的地方，还可以推广机械造林。合作社造林实行社种社有，树种树苗也由合作社负责收集准备，并且要尽量作到就地采种，就地育苗，人人采种，社社育苗。如果有的合作社确实不能解决树种树苗，国家可以尽量给予援助，或者由国家和合作社合作经营。在交通线和河流两旁，大水库和矿山周围，如果国家不便造林护林，也可以分配给附近的合作社按照一定的规格造林。总之，要动员全国合作社的广大人力迅速实现造林规划。各县要抓紧每一个乡每一个社的造林规划，并且按照有无荒地荒山的条件，分别提出建立造林千亩社、五千亩社、万亩社或者万株社、十万株社、百万株社的指标，组织竞赛，按时评比。对于群众在自己宅旁植树，也应该加以组织和鼓励，实行自种自有，并且定出造林十株户、百株户的规划，以便迅速绿化一切城乡。
    在着重依靠群众造林的同时，必须积极发展国营造林。除原有国营林场应该加强以外，还应该利用国有的和合作社无力经营的荒地荒山，组织下放人力，有计划地增建新的林场。国营林场应该以造林营林为主，同时适当结合多种经营（例如农林间作，经营林区、山区副业等），以求降低成本，增加收入。国营林场必须大力改进经营管理，提高造林质量，逐步扩大营林范围，并且认真学习、总结和提高各地林农的先进经验，在造林育林的技术指导、科学试验、采种、选种、育苗、培养良种等方面给合作社以充分的帮助和指导。各地党委应该认真加强对于国营林场的领导，充实林场的干部力量，在干部中提倡勤俭办企业，展开反浪费、反保守的斗争，力求使这些林场成为供应国家木材的重要基地，并且在全民的造林事业中发挥带头作用。
      （三）必须努力提高造林质量，作好造林前的准备工作和造林后的育林工作。
    造林不但要求多快，而且必须好省，必须种得密，活得多，长得快，避免过去有些地方耗费了人力物力而收效不大的现象。为此，在造林以前，必须作好准备工作。必须动员群众，千方百计地采集和准备足够的树种树苗，并且加意保护苗圃、母树林和分散的母树。必须总结当地的先进经验，通过训练传授、参观示范等办法，使广大群众学会选择树种、鉴定树苗、整地、栽种、抚育、保护的技术。在西北、华北和其他干旱地区，尤其必须大力动员群众，用苦干的精神作好蓄水保土工作：平地要整好地，山地要挖鱼鳞坑、水平沟，缺水缺土的山头要送水土上山。造林要保证一定的密度（用材林每公顷一般要有六千株到一万二千株，即每十亩四百株到八百株，经济林、薪炭林、防护林也要根据具体情况规定不同的密度），要保证成活率达到百分之八十以上，并且要按时检查成活情况，及时补足缺苗。
    为了保证造林质量，发展林区生产，在一切造林任务较大的合作社，都应该建立常年的和实行多种经营的林业专业队，以便解决林业生产的必要的固定劳力，掌握农时，提高和普及林业技术，提高劳动效率和林业收益。
      （四）必须做好更新工作和护林工作。
    过去一个时期对于我国若干森林实行大面积采伐，采伐后的迹地依赖天然更新，这个办法是不适合于我国具体条件的，必须加以彻底改正，实行小面积采伐和以人工更新为主、以人工促进天然更新或者以天然更新为辅的方针，使更新的速度超过采伐。应该做到伐一株种二株至三株，并且做到当年伐当年种或次年种。过去几年中尚未更新的迹地，必须在最近期内更新完毕。为了保证采伐和更新相结合，从中央到基层，采伐机构和营林机构都应该实行合并。
    护林防火工作近年已经有进步，但是还必须继续大大加强。应该组织群众，划分地区，订立护林公约，宣传“护林防火，人人有责”，展开森林无火灾的群众运动。合作社对于社内林木要加强管理，建立必要的责任制；对于社员尚未入社的成片林木，应该争取尽快入社，以便保护。国有林区也应该结合群众力量，加强护林防火的设施。
    中共中央和国务院相信，只要认真采取以上各项办法，大力开展千军万马的群众造林运动，经过几年的苦战，我国的绿化面积和森林资源一定可以大大增加，从而将对于我国的工业、农业和人民生活带来极大的利益。
    十年看三年，三年看头年。只要从今年起，争取全国在三年内平均每年造林二亿至三亿亩，保证种活长大，我们就有可能大大提前完成十年的造林任务。今年还有八个多月，无论合作社、国营林场和城乡居民，还可以造很多林，种很多树，种很多草。今年特别要为明年后年准备大量的树种、树苗、草子和技术条件，以便明年后年可以更多、更快、更好、更省地发展造林事业。中共中央和国务院要求各级党委、各级人民委员会、全体党员、青年团员和全体人民，一致动员起来，鼓足革命干劲，加紧造林；在凡是能够造林的时间内不要错过一天时间，抓紧检查造林情况和成活养护情况；为在今年打下大规模造林的基础而奋斗，为在十年或者更短的时间内使全国的森林总面积增加一倍而奋斗。
