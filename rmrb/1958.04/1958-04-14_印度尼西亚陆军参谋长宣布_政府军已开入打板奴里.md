Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 13th: Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution announced in a radio statement on the evening of the 12th that government troops had entered Tapanuli.

The statement said that he had received reports that rebel elements Sinta Pohan and other rebels were vigorously carrying out activities in Tapanuli, and that Simbolon, a leader of the rebel group, had also arrived there. At the same time, Hasibuan, an officer stationed in Padang Sidempuan, a major city in southern Tapanuli, also announced his support for the rebel group. Nasution said that seeing the fact that the 3rd Infantry Regiment did not have sufficient strength to take the necessary steps, he had ordered the 2nd Infantry Regiment and troops from the Siliwangi Division of West Java to enter Tapanuli.

Nasution also ordered the 3rd Infantry Regiment, currently stationed in Tapanuli, to assist the government troops entering Tapanuli in suppressing the rebels.

According to other reports, government troops entering Tapanuli had engaged in a fierce three-hour battle with the rebels on the 11th, 40 kilometers from Langga Payung, and the rebels retreated towards Sungai Liu Lian. On this day, 120 rebel elements surrendered in Tapanuli.
