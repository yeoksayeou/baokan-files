    Give More Consideration to the Needs of Worker-Peasant Readers
    Recently, the People's Daily has made some improvements, which we welcome very much. I am a member of an agricultural cooperative, and our cooperative and teams have subscribed to several more copies of the newspaper.
    Where are the improvements? I see two points:
    1. There are more drawings in the newspaper, from page one to page eight, many news items are accompanied by pictures. Sometimes, after seeing the picture, we know the general idea of the article. Especially on the second page, several times now, advanced agricultural operation methods and improved farm tools have been drawn in detail. Our team also held a meeting to study them, and those who have the conditions are trying to do them.
    2. There are more Editor's Notes and Editor's Remarks. Originally, we work in the fields, we are busy all year round, and our cultural level is not very high. When we get the People's Daily, two large sheets, we can't grasp a key point. Even on one page, there are many news items, all black with words, and we don't know which ones to look at carefully, which news items to read to everyone. Now that there are Editor's Notes and Editor's Remarks, we can find the news item according to the matters pointed out by the editors, have a definite object in view, and the newspaper reader can also do it easily. I hope the newspaper office will continue to do so in the future.

### 多考虑工农读者需要

    多考虑工农读者需要
    最近人民日报有了某些改进，我们很欢迎。我是农业社的一个社员，我们社里和队里又增订了好几份报纸。
    改进在哪里呢？我看到的有两点：
    一、报上画多了，从第一页到第八页，很多消息都配了图画。有时一看到画，就知道文章的大意。特别是第二版，有好几次啦，先进的农业操作方法和改进后的农具，都细细地画上了。我们队上开会也作了研究，有条件的，我们已在试着做。
    二、编者按和编者的话多了。本来我们是干地里活的，常年忙，我们的文化又不大高，一拿到人民日报，两大张，也抓不着一个重点。就是一个版上，消息也很多，黑麻麻的尽是字，也不知道哪儿要细细看，哪条消息要念给大伙听。现在有编者按、编者的话，我们就根据编者指出的事，再去找那条消息，有的放矢，读报员也好办了。希望报社今后继续这样做。
