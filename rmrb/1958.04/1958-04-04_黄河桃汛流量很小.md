Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Yellow River's peach blossom flood peak passed Huayuankou at 10:00 AM yesterday, with a flow of only 1,210 cubic meters per second. This is the smallest peach blossom flood flow since the Yellow River came under the control of the people.

The reason why the Yellow River's peach blossom flood flow is particularly small this year is due to the severe drought last autumn, the small amount of rain and snow in winter, and the widespread construction of water conservancy projects during the large-scale water conservancy movement last winter and this spring, which intercepted river water for storage everywhere and diverted water uphill, reducing the source of Yellow River water.

In the past dozen years, the Yellow River's peach blossom flood flow has generally been above 2,000 cubic meters per second.

    黄河桃汛流量很小
    据新华社讯　黄河今年的桃汛洪峰，在昨天十时过花园口，流量只有一千二百一十秒公方，这是黄河自归人民治理以来最小的桃汛流量。
    今年，黄河桃汛流量特别小的原因：是由于去年秋季大旱，冬季的雨雪小，去冬今春大兴水利运动中，又到处截河蓄水，引水上山，减少了黄河水的来源所致。
    过去十几年的黄河桃汛流量，一般都在二千秒公方以上。
