    Rooting Out the Old Idea of Valuing the Past Over the Present
    Northwest University History Department Teachers Say Only by Promoting Proletarian Ideology and Eliminating Capitalist Ideology Can We Value the Present Over the Past
    (Our Dispatch) According to the Xi'an Daily News:

  "Valuing the present over the past" or "valuing the past over the present"? This is the central question debated by the teachers and students of the History Department of Northwest University recently. The teachers unanimously believe that it is necessary to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate capitalist ideology, thoroughly overcome bourgeois individualism, and change the old worldview and outlook on life in order to truly implement the policy of valuing the present over the past in teaching.

    How to correctly understand "valuing the present over the past"? During the debate, some people believed that "valuing the present over the past" is merely a methodological issue, a matter of the proportion of "ancient" and "modern" in academic research. Many teachers opposed this view. They believe that "valuing the present over the past" is not only a matter of method and direction in academic research, but also a matter of intellectuals thoroughly reforming their thinking and changing their standpoints, viewpoints, and methods. They said that the essence of "valuing the past over the present" is to escape the socialist reality of political life, to escape ideological remolding and the study of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, it is not just a methodological issue, but also a matter of standpoint. Advocating "valuing the present over the past" aims to oppose theory being divorced from practice and thought being divorced from politics, so that academic research serves the current class struggle and production construction. It does not mean that people should not study the ancient, the question is how to study it. If it is divorced from reality, even the "present" cannot be studied well. Some teachers cited the historical experience and lessons of the Paris Commune on the issue of the proletarian dictatorship in modern world history. It is difficult for those who are divorced from the actual struggle to deeply understand it. And talking about the Paris Commune without talking about the necessity of the proletarian dictatorship, without relating it to the anti-Rightist struggle, is still "valuing the past over the present."

    Many teachers also conducted self-criticism and mutual criticism regarding the manifestations of "valuing the past over the present" in teaching. For example, they neglect basic courses and modern and contemporary history, believing that modern and contemporary history can be self-taught. They advocate "deleting branches and leaves and highlighting the trunk," reducing basic courses to the minimum. They neglect internships and classroom discussions. In teaching thought, a prominent manifestation of "valuing the past over the present" is emphasizing historical materials and belittling theory, indulging in tedious textual research. Some old teachers usually talk about historical materials with great interest, but are not interested in the actual struggle. Some teachers believe that historical materials are everything, and that they can be arranged to form a book. The evaluation of a book is also based solely on the amount of historical materials. Individual teachers not only regard historical materials as private property and a "treasure" for fame and profit, but also often encourage students with this idea. The idea of "valuing the past over the present" is also reflected in not analyzing historical facts from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism. When evaluating historical events or figures, some teachers often follow the old views of the ancients or predecessors. For example, when talking about foreign missionaries who came to China in history, they only talk about their impact on the development of Chinese science, but not about the essence of imperialism using missionaries to carry out cultural aggression. Some teachers' lectures focus solely on the role of individual historical figures and the family life of emperors, generals, and ministers, such as Wu Zetian and Yang Guifei, and rarely talk about the role of the working people, the social class relations and economic conditions at the time. When talking about the history of the Tang Dynasty, they praise Tang Taizong for how he treated virtuous people with courtesy. When talking about the Wang Anshi Reform, they talk a lot about Wang Anshi's personal life, but very little about the relationship between the reform and the social class contradictions at the time.

    The teachers also examined the serious harm caused by the idea of "valuing the past over the present." Many teachers said that the idea of "valuing the past over the present" not only hindered the progress of teachers in academic and ideological terms, but also influenced many students to form a bad habit. Under this atmosphere, even some students who want to study modern and contemporary history are afraid of being "looked down upon." Some students, in order to become famous, bury themselves in copying cards all day long, without asking about politics, and still did not know about the "Hungarian incident" more than a year after it happened; some were still reading the "Tao Te Ching" while fighting the Rightists; some students buried themselves in writing "An Examination of Zhuge Liang," looking up books and asking people everywhere: "Who is Zhuge Liang's mother," and one student copied historical materials all day long, did not participate in political movements, and finally went so far as to steal books from bookstores.

    Why do these phenomena occur, and where does the root of "valuing the past over the present" lie? Many teachers also made self-examinations, which can be summarized as:

  (1) Escaping the socialist reality. Ideologically, it is easy to resonate with the old things of the decadent classes, but they do not have the determination to put in hard work to study Marxism-Leninism, new things; (2) Afraid of making mistakes. Some teachers do not dare to talk about the history of ethnic minorities after the Revolution of 1911, fearing that it would violate ethnic policies. They mistakenly believe that "even if you talk about ancient history wrongly, it will not be related to your political stance"; (3) Wanting to take a "shortcut." They believe that "there are ready-made materials for ancient history, which are easy to grasp, and the materials for modern history are not well organized," wanting to exchange less labor for greater results. Some people even mistakenly believe that modern history is not history but politics, and that only those who understand ancient history are considered "learned." In short, the purpose of learning and research is not for socialism but for the individual.

    挖出了厚古薄今的老根
    西北大学历史系教师说，只有兴无灭资，才能厚今薄古
    本报讯　据西安日报报道：
  “厚今薄古”还是“厚古薄今”？这是西北大学历史系师生最近争论的中心问题。教师们一致认为，必须兴无灭资，彻底克服资产阶级个人主义思想，改变旧的世界观和人生观，才能在教学上真正贯彻厚今薄古的方针。
    怎样正确理解“厚今薄古”？辩论中，有人认为“厚今薄古”仅仅是方法问题，是治学中“古”
  “今”比重多少的问题。许多教师反对这种看法。教师们认为，“厚今薄古”不仅是治学的方法方向问题，而且也是关系到知识分子彻底改造思想，转变立场、观点和方法的一个问题。他们说，“厚古薄今”思想的实质是逃避社会主义的现实政治生活，逃避思想改造和马克思列宁主义学习，所以，不只是方法问题，也是一个立场问题。提倡“厚今薄古”，目的在于反对理论脱离实际，思想脱离政治，使学术研究为当前的阶级斗争和生产建设服务，并不是不要人研究古代，问题在于怎样研究。如果脱离实际，就是“今”也研究不好。有的教师举例说，世界近代史中巴黎公社在无产阶级专政问题上的历史经验和教训，脱离现实斗争的人，就很难体会深刻；而讲巴黎公社不讲无产阶级专政的必要性，不联系反右派斗争，这依然是“厚古薄今”。
    许多教师还就“厚古薄今”思想在教学中的表现，进行了自我检查和互相批评。如课程上轻视基础课和近代、现代史，认为近代、现代史可以自学。主张“删除枝叶，突出本干”，把基础课缩减到最低限度。轻视实习和课堂讨论。在教学思想上，“厚古薄今”的一个突出表现是重史料轻理论，醉心于烦琐的考证。一些老教师平时谈起史料来兴致勃勃，津津乐道，而对于现实斗争则不感兴趣。有的教师认为史料就是一切，排列起来就可以成为著作。评价一本著作的好坏，也只是从史料多少上着眼。个别教师不但把史料看作私有财产和成名得利的“看家宝”，而且常以这种思想鼓励学生。“厚古薄今”的思想，还表现在不以马克思列宁主义的观点分析历史事实。有的教师在评价历史事件或人物时，常常因袭古人或前人的旧看法。如讲到历史上外国到中国来的传教士时，只谈他们对中国科学发展的影响，而不谈帝国主义借传教进行文化侵略的实质。有的教师讲课中一味着眼于个别历史人物的作用和帝王将相家族如武则天、杨贵妃等人的生活琐事，而很少谈到劳动人民的作用、当时的社会阶级关系和经济状况。讲到唐代历史，便满口称赞唐太宗如何礼贤下士，讲王安石变法，对王安石私人生活谈的很多，而对变法同当时的社会阶级矛盾谈的很少。
    教师们还检查了“厚古薄今”思想所造成的严重危害。许多教师说，“厚古薄今”思想不仅妨碍了教师在学术和思想上的进步，而且影响所及，在许多学生中也形成了风气。在这种风气下，甚至一些学生想学近代、现代史，也怕别人“瞧不起”。有的学生为了想成名，整天埋头抄卡片，不问政治，“匈牙利事件”发生了一年多还不知道；有的在反右派斗争中还手不释卷地看“道德经”，有的学生埋头写“诸葛亮考”，到处查书问人：“诸葛亮的母亲是谁”，还有一个学生整天抄史料，不参加政治运动，最后竟发展到偷书店的书的地步。
    为什么会产生这些现象，“厚古薄今”的根源究竟在哪里？许多教师也作了检查，归纳起来不外是：
  （一）逃避社会主义现实生活。对没落阶级的旧的东西，思想上容易共鸣，对马克思列宁主义、新的东西，没有决心下苦工夫学习；（二）怕犯错误。有的教师讲民族史，辛亥革命以后的就不敢讲，怕抵触民族政策。错误地认为“讲古代史讲错了也联系不到政治立场”；（三）想走“捷径”。认为“古代史有现成资料，容易掌握，现代史资料没有很好整理”，想以较小的劳动换取较大的成果。有的人甚至错误地认为现代史不是历史而是政治，只有懂古代史才算“学问渊博”。总之，学习研究的目的不是为了社会主义而是为了个人。
