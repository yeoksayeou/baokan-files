　　The great leap forward in socialist construction, with its momentum like ten thousand horses galloping, is inspiring the hearts of hundreds of millions of young people in our country. Young people on the industrial and agricultural fronts are advancing towards nature and towards science and technology with an unstoppable heroic spirit. Young people in intellectual, business, religious and other fields are also increasingly raising their revolutionary drive, striving to accelerate their self-transformation, and cultivating themselves into new socialist youths who have both high political and ideological consciousness and practical scientific and cultural knowledge. Recently, young people in the business community in more than a dozen cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, have successively held self-transformation great leap forward mobilization rallies, expressing their determination to always firmly follow the Communist Party, entrust their hearts to the Party and the people, carry out thorough transformation, and strive to become self-reliant laborers in the not-too-distant future. At this moment, the Third National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation is opening in Beijing, and it will be a victorious conference that further promotes the revolutionary enthusiasm of young people and inspires their revolutionary fighting spirit.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong said that youth is the most active and vigorous force in the entire social force. Like the rising sun and the spring flowers and trees, young people are in a period of flourishing, both physically and intellectually. Young people not only have abundant energy to undertake any arduous task, but also have a tenacious enterprising spirit, are most receptive to new things, and are the most daring to break the old and create the new. In Chinese and foreign history, many people have created great achievements and become great figures, mostly in their youth. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of China's democratic revolution, was a young man in his twenties when he was determined to overthrow the feudal rule of the Qing Dynasty and actively carry out revolutionary activities. Karl Marx, the mentor of the world's proletarian revolution, was only thirty years old when he and Engels wrote the "Communist Manifesto." In the history of mankind, although there are very few great figures like Marx and Sun Yat-sen, there are many people who have made important contributions to the progress of mankind in their youth and are admired by future generations. It is no accident that they became famous figures. One of the important reasons is that they have a fearless spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and daring to fight for the truth, so they can overcome all difficulties and create earth-shattering achievements.

　　Compared with their predecessors, young people living in New China have all the convenient conditions to develop themselves and make even more magnificent achievements. They should be promoters of socialist construction and play a vanguard role in the struggle to transform nature and transform mankind itself. In order to better shoulder this glorious task and live up to the earnest expectations of the Party, the country, and the people, the youth of New China must have tenacious revolutionary perseverance and a bold and innovative spirit. On the one hand, they must humbly learn all the good things from their elders and fully respect the knowledge and experience accumulated by their predecessors; on the other hand, more importantly, they must dare to think about problems that their predecessors have not thought about and dare to do things that their predecessors have not done, and boldly carry out creation, based on delving into reality and delving into the masses. They must never mechanically imitate and follow their predecessors, thinking that they cannot think about problems that their predecessors have not thought about, and that they cannot do things that their predecessors have not done. Such young people will not become young people. Not only can they not play a pioneering role in national construction, but they may also become stumbling blocks on the road to progress. Generally speaking, this kind of conservative thinking of simple imitation and following does not exist among the broad masses of young people in our country. Each of them is like a dragon and a tiger, fighting bravely and tenaciously in various positions. Many of them have formed thousands of youth shock teams and launched heated challenge competitions with each other, determined to work with their elders to accelerate the pace of our country's socialist cause with their own hands. At this youth congress, many young people from various places have brought good news of outstanding achievements in production and construction, and advanced experience in fighting against all backward and unreasonable phenomena. It is fully believed that through the exchange of advanced things among young people at this conference, the revolutionary enthusiasm of young people in our country will surely be higher and their fighting will will surely be more high-spirited.

　　Giving play to the vanguard role of young people in socialist construction and cultivating their bold and innovative spirit of daring to think and daring to do is of course extremely important; but if the problem of the political stance of young people is not solved first, and they are not helped to establish a revolutionary outlook on life, then the goal cannot be achieved. Among the young people in our country, a considerable number of them come from non-proletarian backgrounds, or are themselves bourgeois elements. After several years of education by Party and League organizations and tempering in various revolutionary struggles, especially after last year's anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification campaign currently underway, it should be affirmed that the political and ideological consciousness of the majority of people has been greatly improved. However, it should not be denied that there are still some bourgeois and petty-bourgeois youths who have not yet made up their minds to completely abandon their original positions, and still have various individualistic plans, and some even still waver between socialism and capitalism. In this way, they cannot give full play to their initiative and enthusiasm in socialist construction. On the contrary, they will feel distressed and have endless worries. For the vast number of working youth, there is of course no fundamental change in position, but due to various social reasons, the bourgeois ideology and style also have a certain impact on them. They should also often do the work of removing dust and dirt, and constantly transform and improve themselves. This is one aspect. On the other hand, because young people have not lived in society for too long, they generally lack practical struggle experience, lack knowledge and experience, or have some knowledge, but it is book knowledge that has not been well digested. Therefore, no matter which circles the youth are in, they should regard transformation and learning as a regular and serious task. They must strive to study Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, study the history of the Chinese and world proletarian revolution and current affairs policies, constantly improve their political and ideological consciousness, and master correct thinking methods and working methods. They must regularly participate in labor, especially physical labor, develop the habit of loving labor, cultivate and deepen the ideological feelings and noble qualities and styles of the working people, and learn the skills of labor production. They must seriously and diligently study culture and modern science and technology, and constantly arm their minds with new knowledge, so that they can grow up quickly. As long as these two aspects are properly resolved, young people in our country will have clear love and hate, have a firm political stance, have clear goals, and know for whom to work and work; at the same time, they will have real talent and practical learning and be able to undertake all the work they are required to undertake. In this way, the vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm and bold creative spirit of young people will be a real material thing, and will bloom brilliant flowers and bear rich fruits in the garden of socialist construction.

　　Extensively participating in the struggle to transform nature and transform society, and closely integrating with the working people of workers and peasants is an important way for all young people, especially young people from non-proletarian backgrounds, to carry out self-transformation, and it is also an important way to constantly increase their talents and wisdom. No matter in ancient or modern times, both in China and abroad, all those who have made contributions to the people and to the progress of mankind have grown up through this path; no one who is divorced from reality and divorced from the masses can accomplish anything. In our Party, there are many comrades who originally had a lower level of education and theoretical level, but because they have a fiery revolutionary heart, a thirst for knowledge, and have found the correct way of self-transformation and self-education - combining with workers and peasants, combining with reality, they have successively become excellent leaders and good cadres of the Party. The current generation of young people in our country should also have such determination and ambition, resolutely put down all kinds of inexplicable airs, go deep into factories and rural areas, take workers and peasants as teachers, and learn from them humbly and sincerely. As long as they are willing to do this, they will definitely be able to not only learn the laws of class struggle and train themselves to become staunch revolutionary fighters, but also learn the skills of production and construction and become experts who are familiar with one or several businesses.

　　Youth is the most beautiful time in human life and a period of great promise. People should cherish their youth very much, and while they are young and strong, they should seriously and diligently do a good job. We believe that the youth of our country, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, under the leadership of the long-tested Communist Party, and with the help and education of the Communist Youth League, will give full play to the light and heat of youth, achieve both lofty ideals and a pragmatic spirit, play a vanguard role in the current socialist construction, and become excellent communist successors in the near future.

    发出青春的光和热！
    ——祝中华全国青年第三次代表大会开幕
    势如万马奔腾的社会主义建设大跃进，激励着我国亿万青年的心。在工农业战线上的青年们，正以猛不可当的英雄气概向大自然进军，向科学技术进军。知识界、工商界、宗教界以及其他各方面的青年们，也日益提高了革命的干劲，努力加速自我的改造，把自己培养成为既有高度政治思想觉悟，又有实际科学文化知识的社会主义新青年。最近一个时期，北京、天津和上海等十几个城市的工商界青年，就都先后举行了自我改造跃进誓师大会，表示决心永远坚定地跟着共产党走，把心交给党，交给人民，进行脱胎换骨的改造，力争在不太久的将来就成为自食其力的劳动者。就在这个时候，中国青年第三次代表大会在北京开幕了，它将是一个进一步发扬青年的革命热情，鼓舞青年的革命斗志的胜利的大会。
    毛泽东同志说过，青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。如同初升的太阳和春天的花木一样，青年不论从体力和智力方面来说，都正处在欣欣向荣的时期。青年不仅有充沛的精力，担当得起任何繁重的任务；而且有顽强的进取精神，最易于接受新鲜事物，最敢于打破旧的而创造新的。在中外历史上，许多人创造出伟大的业绩，成为伟大的人物，多半都是在青年时期。我国民主主义革命的伟大先行者孙中山，当他立志推翻清朝封建统治，积极进行革命活动的时候，还是一个二十多岁的青年。世界无产阶级革命的导师马克思，在和恩格斯一起写“共产党宣言”的时候，也只有三十岁。在人类的历史上，像马克思和孙中山这样伟大的人物固然是很少的，但在青年时期就对人类的进步作过重要贡献，为后代所景仰的人是很多的。他们成为有名的人物，并非偶然，重要的原因之一，是他们有一种敢于想、敢于做和敢于为真理而坚持斗争的大无畏精神，所以才能排除一切困难，做出惊天动地的事业。
    同前人比较起来，生活在新中国的青年，有着一切便利的条件来发展自己，做出更加雄伟的事业。他们应该做社会主义建设的促进派，在改造自然也改造人类自身的斗争中起先锋队的作用。新中国的青年为要很好地担负起这个光荣的任务，不辜负党、国家和人民对他们的殷切希望，就必须有顽强的革命毅力，有敢于创造的大胆革新精神。一方面，固然要虚心地向长辈们学习一切优良的东西，要十分尊重前人积累下来的知识和经验；另一方面更重要的是，要在深入实际和深入群众的基础上，敢于想前人没有想过的问题，敢于做前人没有做过的事情，大胆地进行创造。决不应当机械地模仿和因袭前人，以为前人没有想过的问题自己也不能想，前人没有做过的事情自己也不能做。这样的青年就不成其为青年，不仅不能在国家建设中起开路先锋的作用，而且有可能成为前进道路上的绊脚石。一般地说，这种简单因袭和模仿的保守思想，在我国广大青年中是不存在的。他们一个个都像是生龙活虎，正英勇顽强地战斗在各个岗位上。他们中间的许多人，组成了成千上万的青年突击队，并且在相互之间展开了热火朝天的挑战竞赛，决心和长辈们一起，用自己的双手加速我国社会主义事业前进的步伐。在这次的青年代表大会上，就有许多地方的青年带来了在生产建设中获得优异成绩的捷报，带来了同一切落后的和不合理的现象作斗争的先进经验。完全可以相信，通过这次大会对青年中的先进事物的交流，我国青年的革命热情必定会更加高涨，战斗的意志必定会更加昂扬。
    发挥青年在社会主义建设中的先锋作用，培养他们敢于想、敢于做的大胆革新精神，这固然是极其重要的；但是如果不首先解决青年的政治立场问题，不帮助他们树立起革命的人生观，那也是达不到目的的。在我国青年中，有相当一部分人出身于非无产阶级，或者本人就是资产阶级分子。经过几年来党团组织的教育和历次革命斗争的锻炼，特别是经过去年的反右派斗争和目前正在进行的整风，应该肯定大多数人的政治思想觉悟有很大的提高。但是也不应讳言，还有一部分资产阶级和小资产阶级的青年，到今天还没有决心完全抛弃原来的立场，还有着各种各样的个人主义的打算，有的人甚至仍然动摇于社会主义和资本主义之间。这样，他们就不可能在社会主义建设中充分发挥积极性和主动性，相反地还会感到苦恼，有着无穷无尽的忧虑。对于广大的劳动青年来说，固然不存在立场的根本转变问题，然而由于种种社会的原因，资产阶级的思想作风对他们也有一定的影响，他们也应该经常作除尘去污的工作，不断地改造和提高自己。这是一方面。另一方面，由于青年生活在社会上的时间还不太长，他们一般都比较缺乏实际斗争的锻炼，比较缺乏知识和经验，或者有一些知识，也是没有很好消化的书本上的东西。因此，不论那一界的青年，都应该把改造和学习看作经常的严重的任务。要努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作，学习中国和世界无产阶级革命的历史和时事政策，不断地提高自己的政治思想觉悟，掌握正确的思想方法和工作方法。要经常地参加劳动、特别是体力劳动，养成热爱劳动的习惯，培养和加深劳动人民的思想感情和高尚的品质作风，学会劳动生产的技能。要认真地刻苦地学习文化和现代科学技术，不断地用新的知识武装自己的头脑，使自己迅速地成长起来。只要把这两方面的问题妥善地解决了，我国青年就会爱憎分明，有坚定的政治立场，有明确的奋斗目标，知道是为谁劳动和工作；同时又有真才实学，能够担负起要他们担负的一切工作。这样，青年人的蓬勃革命热情和大胆创造的精神，就是实实在在的物质的东西，在社会主义建设的园地上将开出灿烂之花，结出丰硕之果。
    广泛地参加改造自然和改造社会的斗争，密切同工农劳动人民相结合，这是一切青年、特别是非无产阶级出身的青年们进行自我改造的重要途径，也是不断地增长才智的重要途径。不论古今中外，一切对人民立过功、对人类的进步有过贡献的人，都是经由这条道路而成长起来的；未有脱离实际和脱离群众的人，能够干出一番事业来。在我们党内就有许多同志，原来的文化程度和理论水平较低，但是由于他们有一颗火热的革命的心，有如饥似渴的求知欲，又找到了自我改造和自我教育的正确途径——和工农结合、和实际结合，他们都先后成为优秀的领导者和党的好干部。我国目前一代的青年，也应该有这样的决心和志气，坚决放下各种各样莫名其妙的架子，深入到工厂和农村，拜工人农民为师，虚心地、诚恳地向他们学习。只要愿意这样作的，就一定能够既学会阶级斗争的规律，把自己锻炼成为坚定的革命战士；也能够学会生产建设的本领，成为熟悉一种或几种业务的专家。
    青春是人类最美好的时光，是大有作为的时期。人们应该十分爱惜自己的青春，趁着年青力壮的时候，就认真地好好干一干。我们相信，有着光荣革命传统的我国青年，在久经考验的共产党的领导之下，在共青团的帮助和教育之下，一定会把青春的光和热充分发挥出来，作到既有远大理想，又有实干精神，在目前的社会主义建设中起先锋作用，在不久的将来成为优秀的共产主义接班人。
