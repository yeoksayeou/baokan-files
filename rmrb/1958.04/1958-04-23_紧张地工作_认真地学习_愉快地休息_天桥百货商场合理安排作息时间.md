    Work Intensively, Study Diligently, Rest Happily:
    Tianqiao Department Store Rationally Arranges Work and Rest Time
    (Our dispatch) Reporter Ren Zhiqiao reports: The Tianqiao Department Store in Beijing has properly arranged the "one shift until the end" work and rest schedule. Not only has it exceeded the proposed targets, but it also has time for study and rest.
    When the Tianqiao Department Store put forward the initiative, the employees were very enthusiastic, and there were times when working hours were too long and employees were too tired.
    The Party organization and administrative leaders of the store attached great importance to this situation. They first worked on the thinking of the heads of the sales groups, making them realize the importance of caring for the employees' health, explaining that the Great Leap Forward is a long-term process rather than a matter of a day or two, and put forward a new slogan: We must work intensively, study diligently, and rest happily. The employees actively responded to the Party's call and worked with the leaders to further solve the problems of excessive working hours and employee fatigue.
    They arrange work and business activity time according to the busy and slack periods of business. The main service targets of this shopping mall are nearby residents and suburban farmers. There are the most customers from 12:00 noon to 4:00 pm, and fewer customers before 12:00 noon and after 4:00 pm. Therefore, they adopted the principle of "rotational rest during slack times, full attendance during busy times," which is flexibly controlled by the sales group leaders to arrange employee meal and rest times. They provide appropriate care for female salespersons with nursing infants and salespersons who are physically weak, depending on the situation. In addition to full attendance on Sundays, everyone takes turns resting one day per week. Their arrangement for the one-hour-plus spare time in the morning is: Mondays are for trade union activities, Tuesdays and Wednesdays are for cultural studies, Thursdays are for Party and Youth League activities, and Fridays are for business studies. Meetings of administrative group leaders and cadres are held during relatively slack business hours.
    They use methods of adjusting the site, improving labor organization, and simplifying procedures and systems to reduce the labor intensity of salespersons and improve work efficiency. In the past, there were many counters in the shopping mall, and salespersons had to go back and forth to get goods for customers. Now, all commodities that can be displayed openly, such as clothing, shoes, hats, fabrics, and knitwear, are sold openly. They have formed three mutual aid groups in nine sales groups to help each other with sales at any time, reducing the phenomenon of uneven workload among the groups. They have also abolished procedures and systems such as group commodity accounts, sales ten-day reports, payment and goods reconciliation, and handover between shifts. They have implemented a method of inventorying goods on a monthly and quarterly basis, so that after the salespersons finish business, they only need to spend more than ten minutes to count the cash and make a financial statement before they can leave the site.
    The administrative management department and trade union of Tianqiao Department Store have been trying various ways to make it easier for salespersons to rest and reduce labor intensity. They vacated part of the original warehouse in the backyard of the store as employee dormitories for rest or sleep during business rest periods. The financial staff takes the initiative to send change twice a day and collect payments on site in the evening, saving the salespersons from running back and forth. The cooks in the canteen proposed a guarantee: "Whenever the salespersons come to the canteen, they will have hot meals."

### 紧张地工作　认真地学习　愉快地休息  天桥百货商场合理安排作息时间

    紧张地工作　认真地学习　愉快地休息
    天桥百货商场合理安排作息时间
    本报讯　记者任志樵报道：北京天桥百货商场妥善安排了“一班顶到底”的工作和休息时间，不仅超额完成了倡议指标，而且能够有时间学习、休息。
    天桥百货商场在提出倡议的时候，职工们干劲很大，曾经出现过工时过长、职工过累的情况。
    商场的党组织和行政领导上，重视了这一情况。他们先打通营业小组组长的思想，使他们认识关心职工身体的重要意义，说明跃进不是一朝一夕而是长期的道理，并且提出了新的口号：我们要紧张地工作，认真地学习，愉快地休息。职工们积极响应党的号召，和领导一起研究进一步解决工时过长、职工过累的问题。
    他们根据营业忙闲规律来安排工作和业务活动时间。这个商场的主要服务对象是附近居民和郊区农民，中午十二时至下午四时顾客最多，上午十二时以前和下午四时以后顾客较少，因此他们采取了“闲时轮流休息、忙时全部出勤”的原则，由营业组组长灵活掌握，安排职工吃饭和休息时间。对有哺乳婴儿的女售货员和身体弱的售货员，根据不同情况适当照顾。除星期日全体出勤外，每人每星期轮流休息一天。对早晨一个多小时的业余时间，他们的安排是：星期一是工会活动，星期二、三是文化学习，星期四是党团活动，星期五是业务学习。行政组长干部会议在营业较闲的时间开。
    他们用调整现场、改善劳动组织和简化手续制度的办法，来减轻售货员的劳动强度，提高工作效率。过去，商场内柜台很多，售货员要来回为顾客取商品，现在凡是能敞开的商品如服装、鞋帽、布匹、针织品等，都实行了敞开售货。他们在九个营业小组里组成了三个互助组，随时互助售货，减少各组忙闲不均的现象。他们还取消了小组商品账、销货旬报、款货核对、上下班交接等手续制度，实行了按月、按季盘点商品的办法，使售货员在营业完了之后，只要用十几分钟的时间点清现金，做出金额报表就可以退出现场。
    天桥百货商场的行政管理部门和工会想各种办法使售货员休息方便和减轻劳动强度。他们在商店后院把原先的仓库腾出一部分作为职工宿舍，在营业休息时期休息或睡眠。财务人员每天主动送两次分币，晚上到现场收款，免得售货员来去奔波。食堂的炊事员提出保证：“售货员什么时候来食堂，就什么时候有热饭吃”。
