Xinhua News Agency, April 28th dispatch from Aden: The situation in the western "Aden Protectorate" is tense; the British colonial authorities' recent armed suppression of local nationalists has provoked fierce resistance.

    Fighting has already broken out near the border with Yemen. According to an announcement by the British Ministry of Defence on the evening of the 27th, local nationalist armed forces, numbering approximately 300, have surrounded the British army's Asarir Fortress. Somerset, the British government's "Assistant Advisor" stationed in the area, is trapped inside the fortress. Britain has dispatched jets to strafe and bomb the desert region in an attempt to relieve the besieged British fortress.

    Aden is located in the southern Arabian Peninsula, between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, and is a vital transportation route between Europe and Asia. What is generally referred to as Aden includes both the Aden Colony and the "Aden Protectorate." Britain has a governor in the Aden Colony and "political advisors" in all the sheikhdoms of the "Protectorate." These British "advisors" are, in reality, the rulers of these sheikhdoms.

    The Lahej Sultanate is one of the more influential of the twenty-three sheikhdoms, large and small, in the "Aden Protectorate." The movement for independence in this sheikhdom will have a significant impact on the other sheikhdoms. Therefore, the Lahej Sultanate has become the target of recent armed attacks by British colonialists. Britain has transferred many troops and warships from the mainland and its colony of Kenya in Africa. While deceiving the Sultan of Lahej into "negotiations," the British Governor of Aden launched a surprise attack on the sheikhdom and extensively searched for and arrested officials and nationalists of the Lahej Sultanate.

    At the same time, the British authorities are forcing the Sultan of Lahej, Karim, to leave his country and go to Britain for "medical treatment." The Sultan of Lahej has firmly refused to participate in the Arab United Emirates centered on Aden, which Britain is planning, and supports the nationalists' demands to break free from British control.

    The "Aden Protectorate" was originally territory in southern Yemen. After Britain seized this territory in Yemen, it deliberately did not define its border with Yemen, constantly creating border disputes in an attempt to further encroach on Yemeni territory. The struggle of the Aden sheikhdoms to break free from British rule has received the support of Yemen and other Arab countries.

    亚丁人民勇抗英国武装镇压
    英军亚萨里尔要塞陷入包围
    据新华社28日讯　亚丁消息：“亚丁保护地”西部的局势紧张；英国殖民当局最近对当地民族主义者的武装镇压已经引起剧烈的反抗。
    靠近也门边境的地方已经发生战事。据英国国防部在27日晚间宣布，当地民族主义武装约三百人包围了英军的亚萨里尔要塞。英国政府派驻在这个地区的“助理顾问”索默塞特被围在要塞里面。英国出动喷气机在这个沙漠地区扫射和轰炸，企图为这个被围困的英军要塞解围。
    亚丁位于阿拉伯半岛南部、红海和印度海之间，是欧亚之间的交通要道。一般所称的亚丁，包括亚丁殖民地和“亚丁保护地”两部分。英国在亚丁殖民地设有总督，在“保护地”的所有酋长国中都派有“政治顾问”，这些英国“顾问”实际上是这些酋长国的统治者。
    拉赫杰酋长国是“亚丁保护地”中二十三个大小酋长国中具有较大影响的一个，这个酋长国的争取独立的运动将给其他酋长国带来极大的影响。因此，拉赫杰酋长国成为最近英国殖民者发动武装进攻的对象。英国从本土和在非洲的殖民地怯尼亚调来许多军队和军舰。亚丁的英国总督在诱骗拉赫杰苏丹进行“谈判”的时候，开始向这个酋长国发动突然的进攻，并且大肆搜捕拉赫杰酋长国的官员和民族主义者。
    同时，英国当局正在逼迫拉赫杰苏丹克里姆离开他的国家，前往英国“治病”。拉赫杰苏丹曾经坚决拒绝参加英国筹划的以亚丁为中心的阿拉伯联合酋长国，并且支持民族主义者摆脱英国控制的要求。
      “亚丁保护地”原是也门南部的领土，英国在霸占也门的这块领土以后还故意不确定它同也门的边界，不断制造边境纠纷，企图进一步蚕食也门的领土。亚丁酋长国要求摆脱英国统治的斗争，得到也门和其它阿拉伯国家的支持。
