Actively Prevent and Control Crop Diseases and Pests
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

When we have made full preparations for water conservancy, fertilizers, and seeds, we still may not be able to guarantee normal crop growth and increased yields if we do not fight against crop diseases and pests.

This year, it is entirely necessary and possible to launch a mass movement throughout the country centered on large-scale and thorough prevention and control to overcome crop disease and pest disasters. In the great leap forward in agriculture, the masses' enthusiasm for production is unprecedentedly high, and they have formulated leap forward production increase targets, urgently requiring leap forward technical measures. Large-scale elimination of crop diseases and pests is one of these. Last year, our country already set examples of large-scale and thorough prevention and control of diseases and pests and ensuring production increase and income growth in about five million mu of cotton fields and paddy fields. After a year of efforts in Xinxiang and Huojia counties, Henan Province, 200,000 mu of cotton fields have basically eliminated the harm of cotton aphids, spider mites, and cotton bollworms, with an average yield of ginned cotton reaching 60 to 65 jin per mu, about 80% higher than the average yield per mu in the entire Xinxiang region. Jiangsu Province has eliminated locust plagues on 630,000 mu of cultivated land. Rice borers are relatively difficult to eliminate, but after two years of efforts in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, with over 800,000 mu of paddy fields, the borer damage rate has been reduced from 18% to 2%. We can say that we already have experience in large-scale and thorough prevention and control of crop diseases and pests. At the same time, the state's support for rural areas this year in terms of pesticides, sprayers, and dusters is more than three times that of last year, providing ample material guarantees. A large number of scientific research personnel going to the countryside and a large number of cadres being sent to lower levels can all become forces for the promotion of new technologies. All of these are favorable conditions for fighting diseases and pests.

Currently, many places have put forward the slogan of eliminating major local crop diseases and pests ahead of schedule. According to statistics from 20 provinces and cities, it has been decided this year to carry out large-scale and thorough prevention and control on more than 210 million mu. Many places are currently actively transferring medicines and equipment and imparting technology to townships and areas. These all foreshadow a significant acceleration in the speed of eliminating crop diseases and pests.

To make the elimination of crop diseases and pests a mass movement, it is necessary to have the unified leadership of the local Party committees and to organize the forces of relevant departments such as agriculture, supply and marketing, health, handicrafts, youth, and women, assigning responsibilities and conscientiously doing a good job in ideological mobilization, technical instruction, preparation of medicines and equipment, and safety education. At the same time, due to the large number of types of diseases and pests, their wide distribution, rapid reproduction, and easy spread, the struggle against diseases and pests has a strong technical and temporal nature. It is necessary to mobilize the local scientific and technological forces, formulate practical and feasible technical plans, and strengthen forecasting and early warning, and carry out mass pest surveys in order to complete the task in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

Some people have a mentality of luck, often fantasizing that diseases and pests will not occur, or if they do, they will be mild. They do not prepare in advance or prepare very poorly, and when diseases and pests occur, they are caught off guard and respond hastily. Hastily responding will certainly achieve some results, but crops have often already suffered great damage, and the waste of manpower and materials is also very large, making it impossible to completely eliminate diseases and pests. The fact that Hebei Province neglected investigation and relaxed preparations in 1957, resulting in a passive battle in locust control work and causing great waste, is a lesson. Therefore, our slogan should be: "Prevent even if there are no pests, treat when there are pests."

Others have a serious sense of dependence, believing that "eliminating diseases and pests is easy, just get good medicine and good equipment." Of course, the state will do its best to support with good medicine and good equipment. It has done so in the past, and will do more in the future. But eliminating diseases and pests still depends primarily on the masses. Last year, Xinxiang and other places relied on the masses to modify single-tube sprayers into two-person-carried rapid sprayers, increasing efficiency by more than two times. They also used various tools, developing from backward manual stem application to the use of aircraft for control. Their slogan was "use whatever is available," and thus they excellently completed the task of large-scale and thorough prevention and control. If Xinxiang can do it, what reason is there for other regions not to be able to do it? There are methods, the problem is to let go and mobilize the masses.

Spring returns to the earth, and the season for diseases and pests is approaching. For this year's bumper harvest in agriculture, Party committees at all levels should immediately take action. Places that have not formulated prevention and control plans should quickly formulate them, and those that have already formulated prevention and control plans should quickly do all the preparatory work and conduct a thorough inspection down to the communes, so that the prevention and control plans take root in the communes.

    积极防治农作物病虫害
    本报评论员
    当我们对水利、肥料、种子等都做了充分准备的时候，如果不同农作物病虫害进行斗争，还是不一定能够保障农作物正常生长，增产丰收。
    今年，在全国范围内开展一个以大面积彻底防治为中心的战胜病虫灾害的群众运动，是完全必要而且可能的。在农业大跃进中，群众生产热情空前高涨，制定了跃进的增产指标，迫切要求有跃进的技术措施。大规模消灭农作物病虫害，就是其中之一。去年，我国已经在五百来万亩棉田、稻田内做出了大面积彻底防治病虫害和保产增收的榜样。河南省新乡、获嘉二十万亩棉田经过去年一年的努力，已经基本上消灭了棉蚜、红蜘蛛、棉铃虫的为害，亩产皮棉平均达到六十至六十五斤，比新乡全专区的平均亩产量高出八成左右。江苏省已经在六十三万亩耕地上消灭了蝗灾。水稻螟虫是比较难消灭的，但湖北孝感县八十多万亩稻田，经过两年努力，螟害率已由18％压低到2％。我们在大面积彻底防治农作物病虫害方面，可以说已经有了经验。同时，国家今年支援农村的农药、喷雾器、喷粉器等也比去年多三倍以上，提供了充分的物质保证。科学研究人员大批下乡，干部大批下放，都可以成为新技术的推广力量。所有这些，都是对病虫害作战的有利条件。
    现在，许多地方已经提出了提前消灭当地农作物主要病虫害的口号。据二十个省、市统计，今年决定大面积彻底防治二亿一千余万亩。很多地方目前已在积极调运药械，分乡分片传授技术。这些都预示着消灭农作物病虫害的速度将大大加快。
    要使消灭农作物病虫害的工作成为一个群众运动，必须要有当地党委的统一领导，并把农业、供销、卫生、手工业、青年、妇女等有关部门的力量组织起来，分工负责，切实作好思想发动、技术传授、药械准备、安全教育等工作。同时，由于病虫害种类多、分布广、繁殖快、易于传播蔓延，因此，同病虫害作斗争具有强烈的技术性和时间性。必须把当地的科学技术力量动员起来，制定切实可行的技术方案，并加强预测预报，开展群众性的虫情普查，才能多快好省地完成任务。
    有些人怀有侥幸心理，常常幻想病虫害不发生，或者虽发生而轻微。他们事先不作准备或准备很差，病虫害发生时则措手不及，仓促应战。仓促应战当然也会取得一定的效果，但是农作物往往已经受到很大伤害，人力物力的浪费也很大，更不可能达到彻底消灭病虫害的目的。1957年河北省疏于侦查，放松准备，以致在治蝗工作上打了被动仗，造成极大的浪费，就是一个教训。所以我们的口号应当是：“没虫要防，有虫要治。”
    另一些人有严重的依赖思想，认为“消灭病虫害容易，只是要拿好药好械来”。当然，国家是要尽力以好药、好械支援的，过去已经这样做了，将来还要更多的做。但消灭病虫害还是首先要依靠群众。去年新乡等地依靠群众将单管喷雾器改装成二人抬快速喷雾器，效率提高两倍以上。还运用了各种工具，从落后的人工涂茎，发展到使用飞机防治。他们的口号是“有啥用啥”，因而出色地完成了大面积彻底防治的任务。新乡能办到的事情，其他地区有什么理由办不到呢？办法是有的，问题就是要放手发动群众。
    春回大地，病虫害季节已经愈来愈逼近了。为了今年农业的大丰收，各级党委应当立即行动起来。没有制定防治计划的地方要赶快制定防治计划，已经制定防治计划的要赶快做好一切准备工作，来一次深入到社的大检查，使防治计划扎根到社。
