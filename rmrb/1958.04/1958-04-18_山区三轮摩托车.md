    Mountain Area Three-Wheeled Motorcycle

    Staff and workers of the joint state-private owned Fuzhou Automobile Repair Factory have successfully trial-produced a three-wheeled motorcycle suitable for transporting goods on mountain areas and rural roads. It has an open-top carriage about one meter wide, capable of carrying 350 kilograms of goods. The motorcycle truck's engine is started by an ignition coil and battery. The entire vehicle has two rear brakes and one front brake, making it easier to drive and less prone to tipping over than ordinary motorcycles started by magnetos.

    山区三轮摩托车
    公私合营福州汽车修理厂职工试制成功了一种适宜在山区和农村大道上行驶的运货用的三轮摩托车。它带有一个宽约一公尺左右的敞棚车厢，可载运三百五十公斤货物。摩托货车的发动机由火线圈和电瓶发动，全车有两个后刹车和一个前刹车，比用磁电机发动的一般摩托车容易驾驶又不易翻车。
