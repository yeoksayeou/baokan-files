    Hopes of Transferred Cadres
    I found the March 11th, page four report on the Hejian County Party Committee's comprehensive leadership over transferred cadres very enlightening. Although it was reported as a leadership experience, the issues raised in it are helpful to us transferred cadres. I hope that more in-depth reports like this can be made in the future.
    In addition, I hope that the People's Daily can focus on a few issues based on the ideological development patterns of transferred cadres in rural areas. For example, how to balance being both a student and doing political and ideological work, the issue of promoting science and technology, and how transferred cadres in third-category communes and teams can combine transformation, training, and playing a positive role. I hope you will write some specific analytical articles about these. Chen Yu

    Frequently Publish Readers' Letters
    Every day when the newspaper arrives, I read the readers' letters. Whether it is the opinions written by readers from rural areas, factories, or government agencies, I feel that they are helpful to me and worth paying attention to in my work. I hope the newspaper can frequently publish readers' letters.

    An Inspiring Newsletter
    After reading the article "Respects to the People of Changshu" by Zhou Yang and Zhou Erfu, published in the People's Daily on March 19th, my heart was filled with excitement and strength.
    First of all, I am deeply inspired by the soaring revolutionary spirit of the people of Changshu County, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition. I love this newsletter, and I love the people of Changshu who are in the surging tide of the Great Leap Forward, and I wish them victory, and more victories.
    Secondly, I thank the two authors of this newsletter, Comrades Zhou Yang and Zhou Erfu, for taking the time out of their busy work to personally go to the scene for interviews. I hope that writers, especially veteran writers with rich creative experience, will pick up their pens and express the heroic figures in the current surging tide of life in the form of features and essays. We very much welcome this genre.

    Welcome This Kind of Reporting
    After reading the report on Guizhou on the fourth page of the People's Daily on March 19th, I was very excited.
    I have long hoped to see this kind of reporting, because we know too little about remote areas, especially since we have had very bad impressions of these areas for a long time. But what about after liberation? Although we also know some of the progress in these areas, it is still very little. After reading your newspaper's report, it was like attending a rich political lesson and a vivid geography lesson.
    At the same time, this kind of reporting is very attractive, not only is the layout novel and the titles moving, but the content is also very rich, with reports, information, comments, illustrations, and introductions of new people and new things from local newspapers.
    I hope that the People's Daily can organize more of this kind of reporting in the future, not only for remote areas, but also for advanced areas.

    I Like This Column Very Much
    "Glorious Labor, Glorious People" on page three of the People's Daily is a good and popular column, and my comrades and I like it very much.
    Since the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, people on all fronts have mustered revolutionary enthusiasm and forged ahead bravely, and new people and new things have emerged continuously. In order to commend these heroes and model figures, and to facilitate everyone to learn from their advanced experience, I hope that the People's Daily can regularly publish this column, introduce the miracles created by the model figures, and publish photos in this column.

    下放干部的希望
    看到3月11日四版报道的河间县委全面领导下放干部的消息，感到很有启发。虽是作为领导经验来报道的，但其中所提的几个问题，对于我们下放干部都有帮助。希望以后能多作这种比较深入的报道。
    另外，希望人民日报能根据下放干部在农村中的思想发展规律，比较集中地提出几个问题，如怎样对待又当学生又做政治思想工作、推广科学技术的问题，在三类社、队的下放干部如何使改造、锻炼与起好作用相结合的问题等，写一些具体分析的文章。　陈　育
    经常刊登读者来信
    每天来报，我都要看看读者来信。不论是农村、工厂、机关读者写的意见，我看了后都感觉对自己有帮助，值得我在工作中注意。我希望报纸能经常刊登读者来信。
      陕西三原县安乐乡　贾长春一篇振奋人心的通讯
    读了3月19日人民日报登的周扬、周而复的“向常熟人民致敬”一文后，内心充满着激奋和力量。
    首先，深深为有光荣革命传统的常熟县人民那种冲天的革命干劲所鼓舞。我爱这篇通讯，更爱在跃进激流中的常熟人民，并预祝他们胜利，再胜利。
    其次，感谢这篇通讯的二位作者——周扬和周而复同志，在百忙的工作中能抽出时间，亲自赴现场采访。希望作家们，特别是有丰富创作经验的老作家们，都拿起笔来，把当前生活激流中的英雄人物，用特写和散文形式表达出来。我们非常欢迎这种体裁。

    欢迎这种报道
    看了人民日报3月19日第四版上关于贵州的报道后，感到非常兴奋。
    这种报道长期来我都希望看到，因为我们对边远地区了解得太少，特别是过去长期来就对这些地区有着非常坏的印象。可是解放后怎样呢？虽然我们也知道这些地区的一些进步，但毕竟少得很。看了贵报的报道后，就好像上了一堂丰富的政治课和生动的地理课。
    同时这种报道非常吸引人，不但版面新颖，标题动人，而且内容很丰富，有报道、有资料、有评论，有插图，并有当地报纸上新人新事的介绍。
    希望人民日报今后能够多组织这种报道，不但是边远地区，就是先进地区也是需要的。

    我很喜欢这一栏
    人民日报三版上“光荣的劳动，光荣的人”是一个很好的、受到大家欢迎的一栏，我和我的同志们很喜欢。
    从大跃进的热潮掀起后，各个战线上的人们都鼓起革命干劲，奋勇前进，新人新事不断地出现。为了表扬这些英雄和模范人物，便于大家向他们学习先进经验，我希望人民日报能够经常刊出这一栏，介绍模范人物们所创造的奇迹，并在这一栏中登上照片。
