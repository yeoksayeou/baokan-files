A Little Chat About Solar Eclipses
    Lǐ Wán

    On the morning of April 19th, an interesting solar eclipse phenomenon can be seen everywhere on the vast land of our motherland.

    In the history of the world, China has the earliest and most abundant records of solar eclipses. Records of solar eclipses have been found on oracle bones from the Yin Dynasty, more than three thousand years ago. These records are extremely valuable materials for archaeology and astronomy.

    What is a solar eclipse? Many people already know that it is the phenomenon of the moon blocking the sun. Whenever the moon goes between the sun and the earth, and the sun, moon, and earth are exactly in a straight line, the moon will block the sun, and a solar eclipse will occur.

    Now, science has revealed the secrets of solar eclipses, and people have understood the reason for solar eclipses. Astronomers can accurately calculate the occurrence of solar eclipses in advance based on the laws of the moon and earth's movement, without error even by a second!

    According to calculations by the Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the solar eclipse situation that can be seen in the Beijing area this time is as follows:

    The solar eclipse starts at 9:59 AM on April 19th. The moon begins to slowly cover the lower half of the sun from west to east. At 11:30 AM, it is the time when the sun is most covered by the moon. You can see that most of the sun is covered by the moon, and the bright part of the sun looks like an inverted crescent shape. At this time, the part of the sun covered accounts for 57% of the sun's surface diameter. Afterwards, the moon slowly withdraws from the sun from west to east, and the solar eclipse ends at 1:05 PM.

    Nationwide, most areas can see a solar eclipse phenomenon where more than half of the sun is covered around 11:00 AM on April 19th. The closer to the southwest, the earlier the solar eclipse appears, and the closer to the northeast, the later it appears. The further southeast, the larger the part of the sun that is covered. In Hainan Island, parts of Guangdong and Fujian's coast, and northern Taiwan, an annular solar eclipse can be seen. That is, the moon covers most of the sun, leaving only a bright circle around the sun, like a luminous ring.

    Scientific observation of solar eclipses is of great significance. It is an excellent opportunity to study the sun, which is most closely related to us, and many natural phenomena. For example, during the observation of a total solar eclipse nearly a hundred years ago in 1868, a chemical element "helium" that had not been discovered in the past was found on the sun. Later, this helium element was found on Earth in 1895. Now helium has become a widely used element in industrial technology.

    As for the general method of watching a solar eclipse, it is very simple. Just use a piece of glass coated with ink or blackened by smoke, or overlap several used photographic negatives and put them in front of your eyes to see the solar eclipse clearly. You can also put a basin of water on the ground and watch the reflection of the solar eclipse in the water. But do not look directly at the sun with a telescope, as it will burn your eyes. If you use a telescope, you can only project it on cardboard to watch. It is best to set the time accurately before the solar eclipse, so you can see how accurate the astronomer's calculations are!

    漫话日食
    李杬
    4月19日的上午，在祖国广阔的土地上，到处都能看到一次有趣的日食现象。
    在世界的历史当中，我国有着世界最早的和最丰富的日食记录，远在三千多年以前的殷代甲骨文中，就已经有日食的记载了。这些记载对于考古学和天文学上说来，都是极其珍贵的资料。
    日食是什么呢？很多人都已知道，就是月亮把太阳遮住的现象。每当月亮走到太阳和地球中间，而且使太阳、月亮、地球正好成为一条直线的时候，月亮就会把太阳遮住，日食就发生了。
    现在，科学揭露了日食的秘密，人们已经明白了日食的道理。天文学家们根据月亮和地球运行的规律可以事先准确地计算出发生日食的情况，分秒都不会错误！
    根据中国科学院紫金山天文台的计算，北京地区这次能看到的日食情况是这样的。
    日食从4月19日上午9时59分开始。月亮从西往东开始慢慢地遮住太阳的下半部。到11时30分，是太阳被月亮遮住最多的时候，你可以看到大半个太阳被月亮遮住了，太阳明亮的部分好像一弯倒挂的月牙形状。这时太阳被遮去的部分占太阳表面直径的57％。过后，月亮又慢慢地由西往东退出太阳，到下午1时5分，日食就结束了。
    就全国范围来说，大部分的地区都能在4月19日上午11点多钟的时候，可以看到太阳被遮去一半以上的日食现象。越靠西南的地方日食出现的时间越早，越靠东北，出现的时间越迟。越往东南地区，看到太阳被遮去的部分就越大。在我国海南岛、广东和福建的部分沿海，台湾北部等地都能看到日环食的现象。就是月亮把太阳遮去了绝大部分，只在太阳周围露出了明亮的一圈，就像一只发光的圆环。
    日食的科学观测是有着重大意义的。它是研究与我们关系最密切的太阳和许多自然现象的绝好机会。例如在将近一百年前的1868年，在观测日全食时，发现太阳上有一种过去没有发现过的化学元素“氦”，后来在1895年才在地球上找到了这种氦元素。现在氦已成为工业技术上应用很广的元素了。
    至于一般的看日食的方法就很简单了，只要用一块涂了墨或被烟熏黑了的玻璃，或者用几张用过了的照相底片重合起来放在眼睛前面去看，就能清楚地看到日食。也可以打一盆水放在地上，看映在水里的日食倒影。但是切不可以用望远镜直接去看太阳，那会把眼睛烧坏的。如果用望远镜，只能在纸板上投影来看。最好在日食前把时间对准，这样你就可以看出天文学家的计算是多么准确！
