Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The central state organs, in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, are adopting a method of promoting progress from top to bottom and left to right, to establish new relationships of mutual support and cooperation between departments in the spirit of rectification.

Due to the new situation of the great leap forward in production and construction brought about by the rectification movement, the old equilibrium has been broken. This situation compels all departments to look at the new changes in the business relationships between their neighbors and those above and below them. Every link must strive to move upstream, catch up with the advanced, and establish new cooperation. Recently, many central departments have conducted extensive investigations and research, proactively collecting criticisms from relevant departments. Some units have sent cadres out to solicit opinions; some have engaged in back-and-forth exchanges in professional meetings; some have visited others to solicit opinions and proactively study cooperation; and some units have even sent big-character posters out of Beijing. In order to promote the inter-varietal hybridization of corn, many cadres in the Ministry of Agriculture wrote big-character posters and sent them to various provinces, asking them to immediately strengthen leadership in this work. This method of working has promoted the rectification and great leap forward in various departments.

Since the beginning of spring, under the impact of the nationwide great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the demand for machinery and equipment has been increasing almost daily. This situation has prominently exposed the contradiction between production and demand in the First Ministry of Machine Building. Recently, the First Ministry of Machine Building convened an order placement conference, with more than 8,000 representatives from local areas and enterprises. The order placement representatives from various places were truly thronged with visitors. They reached out for machines, and at the meeting, they spoke out freely, criticizing the conservative thinking of some enterprise representatives and the departmentalism of those unwilling to hand over all their products to the state for unified allocation. Many local representatives also met directly with enterprise representatives to talk to them, introducing the inspiring new atmosphere of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural construction in various places and reflecting the urgent desire of the broad masses for the supply of machinery and equipment. This atmosphere of the great leap forward played a great role in promoting progress. Many enterprise representatives put up big-character posters expressing their determination to overcome conservative thinking and to meet the needs of all aspects of machinery and equipment as much as possible. Some even wrote letters or made long-distance calls to the leadership of their enterprises overnight to convey the demands of the order placement representatives. After hearing about these situations from their factory representatives, the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory immediately convened an emergency factory affairs meeting and a mass meeting of all employees to compare their enthusiasm for work. At the same time, they also sent cadres overnight to Beijing to understand the situation of the meeting. Now, this factory has put forward a new plan that is more than double the original leap forward plan. Although there are still many difficulties in the supply of raw materials, they expressed their determination to adapt to the development of the situation and to make another leap forward. These situations have turned the order placement conference into a vivid rectification meeting that promotes the great leap forward in the machinery industry.

Some comprehensive departments have achieved good results by adopting the method of combining rectification from top to bottom and left to right. Four vice ministers and four assistant ministers of the Ministry of Finance once led cadres to Zhejiang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Hebei, Sichuan, Shandong, and Beijing to specifically solicit opinions on financial work. Recently, this ministry has sent eight more working groups to Shandong, Hebei, the Southwest, and other places to understand the situation. At the same time, it has also sent more than 450 people to various ministries of the central government and units in Beijing to hold rectification forums, conduct individual conversations, and collect criticisms from big-character posters and exhibitions. Through the method of combining rectification from top to bottom and left to right, this ministry has discovered that there were many serious conservative and backward phenomena in financial work in the past that could not meet the requirements of the great leap forward. For example, many technical schools are implementing work-study programs, processing and producing for factories. However, according to tax laws, technical schools that accept processing work must pay more taxes than the processing fees they receive, resulting in income not covering expenses and affecting the implementation of the work-study program policy in some schools. Based on the opinions of all parties, the Ministry of Finance is now launching a major debate on the financial system and regulations and has put forward preliminary opinions on rectifying more than 1,400 regulations.

In order to support each other in the great leap forward and strengthen socialist cooperation, many units of the central state organs have taken the opportunity of rectification to automatically establish contact with relevant departments and proactively cooperate. In the past, some important issues between departments often required higher-level leading organs to arbitrate and resolve. Sometimes, they adopted a "business-like" attitude towards each other, and it was still unavoidable to have "bargaining" and "back-and-forth delays," making it impossible to quickly solve problems. Now, adopting the mass line method to proactively cooperate with each other has greatly strengthened mutual cooperation. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture has contacted and consulted with the Ministry of Water Conservancy and Electric Power, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, and other closely related departments, soliciting their opinions and putting forward requirements for promoting the great leap forward in agriculture. The First Ministry of Machine Building has conducted a thorough investigation of the leap forward plans of some important industrial, agricultural, and water conservancy departments, and keeps abreast of their new trends at all times, using this as a basis to demand striving for upstream and proactively establishing new cooperative relationships. In the past, there were often uncoordinated phenomena between the Ministry of Health and the First Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, etc., in the use, supply and marketing, and production of medicines. For example, when a disease occurred in a certain place, the supply and marketing of medicines were often disconnected, which often delayed matters. After airing opinions freely, these departments are studying ways to solve such problems. The Ministry of Coal Industry, the First Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Railways have recently established cooperative relationships to jointly promote the great leap forward. They either automatically convene cooperation meetings, or visit each other to exchange cooperation conditions. The three departments have decided to mutually guarantee that in the future, in terms of coal, they will produce, sell, and transport as much as possible, mutually assume obligations, and mutually provide convenience in their work. Under the situation of the great leap forward, the increase in transportation volume has added a heavy task to the Ministry of Railways. In order to strengthen cooperation, the Ministry of Railways specially convened a cargo owner meeting attended by representatives from more than 20 units of various ministries of the central government. The meeting discussed the issue of balanced transportation, and at the same time, various departments put forward more than 120 important criticisms and suggestions to the Ministry of Railways, especially requesting the Ministry of Railways to improve the shortcomings of some regulations that were too rigid and strict. After the meeting, the Ministry of Railways quickly made improvements to some unreasonable systems. For example, in order to ensure that agricultural machinery is transported to the countryside in a timely manner and that increased coal production is transported out of the mines in a timely manner, when these two types of materials require additional vehicle plans outside the transportation plan, the railway department decided to provide convenience as much as possible, allocate vehicles, and waive fines according to specific conditions. At the cargo owner meeting, many units also automatically put forward guarantee conditions to the Ministry of Railways. The representative of the Ministry of Food mentioned that some food allocations of the Ministry of Food in the past were unreasonable, causing waste. Now, the Ministry of Food has proposed to strengthen planning as much as possible and reduce unreasonable transportation phenomena, so that the amount of unreasonable transportation will be reduced from 18% last year to 10%.

The deepening of the rectification movement has made the rectification movement in various departments far exceed the scope of their own departments. To catch up with the advanced and achieve a new balance between each link, it is necessary to carry out rectification with the door open, proactively strengthen contacts with those above, below, left, and right, and establish new cooperation.

    中央国家机关整风运动内外贯通
    上下左右一齐促进
    各部门已开始建立互相协作和支援的新关系
    新华社2日讯　中央国家机关在反浪费反保守运动中，正采取上下左右一齐促进的办法，以整风的精神建立各部门之间互相支援，互相协作的新关系。
    由于整风运动所带来的生产建设大跃进的新形势，旧的平衡关系被突破了，这种情况促使各部门必须看左邻右舍和上下之间业务关系的新变化，各个环节必须力争上游，赶上先进，建立新的协作。最近中央许多部门都广泛地进行了调查研究，主动的搜集有关部门的批评意见，有的单位专门派干部外出征求意见；有的通过专业会议上下交锋；有的登门鸣放，主动研究协作，有的机关的大字报并且飞出了北京，农业部为推动玉米品种间杂交的工作，很多干部写了大字报，分头寄到了各省，要求立即加强对这一工作的领导，这种工作法，对于各部门整风和大跃进起了促进作用。
    入春以来，在全国工业和农业大跃进形势的冲击下，机械设备的需要量几乎每天都增长，这种情况使第一机械工业部在生产和需要之间的矛盾突出地暴露出来。最近一机部召开了订货会议，参加的地方代表和企业代表有八千多人，各地派来的订货代表真是门庭若市，熙熙攘攘，他们伸出手来要机器，并且在会上大鸣大放，批评一些企业代表的保守思想，批评不愿把产品全部拿出来交给国家统一分配的本位主义思想；许多地方代表并同企业代表直接见面谈心，介绍各地工农业建设大跃进的鼓舞人心的新气象，反映广大人民要求供应机器设备的迫切心情。这种大跃进的气氛起了极大的促进作用，许多企业代表贴大字报表示决心克服保守思想，要尽一切可能满足各方面机器设备的需要，有的连夜写信或打长途电话向企业的领导方面传达订货代表的要求。南京机床厂听到厂的代表谈到这些情况以后，立即召开紧急厂务会议和全体职工比干劲大会，同时还派了干部连夜赶到北京来了解会议的情况，现在这个厂已提出了比原来的跃进计划增长二倍多的新计划，虽然在原材料供应方面还有许多困难，但是他们表示一定要适应形势的发展，来一个跃进再跃进。这些情况使订货会议实际上变成了一个促进机械工业大跃进的生动的整风会议。
    一些综合部门采取上下左右结合整风的办法效果很好。财政部有四位副部长和四位部长助理曾带领干部到浙江、上海、武汉、河北、四川、山东和北京市等地专门征求对财政工作的意见；最近这个部又派出了八个工作组分赴山东、河北、西南等地了解情况；同时还派出了四百五十多人次去中央各部和北京市各单位召开整风座谈会、进行个别交谈和搜集大字报及展览会上的批评材料。通过上下左右结合整改的办法，这个部发现过去在财政工作上存在着很多严重的保守落后现象，不能适应大跃进的要求。例如许多技工学校正在实行勤工俭学，为工厂加工生产，但是按照税法规定，接受加工的技工学校要缴出比所得的加工手续费还要多的税款，结果入不敷出，影响了一些学校对勤工俭学方针的贯彻。根据各方面的意见，现在财政部正在展开关于财政体制和规章制度的大辩论，并且提出了对一千四百多个规章制度进行整顿的初步意见。
    为了在大跃进中相互支援，加强社会主义的协作，中央国家机关许多单位通过整风的机会，自动同有关部门建立了联系，主动地配合。过去部门之间发生的一些重要问题，常常需要高一级的领导机关来仲裁解决，有时相互之间采取“公事公办”的态度，还难免出现“讨价还价”、“往返周折”的情况，不能迅速地解决问题。现在采取群众路线的方法相互主动配合，就大大地加强了相互间的协作。农业部最近同关系密切的水利电力、第一机械、化工、轻工业等部都进行了联系和协商，征求对方的意见并向对方提出了促进农业大跃进的要求。一机部对一些重要的工业、农业、水利部门的跃进规划全部做了调查，并随时掌握对方新的行情，以此作依据，要求力争上游，主动地建立新的协作关系。卫生部同第一商业部、化工部等在药品的使用、供销、生产方面，过去常常存在不协调的现象，例如某地发生了病情，而药品的供销却脱节，因而常常误了事情，经过鸣放以后，这几个部门正在对这类问题研究解决的办法。煤炭、第一商业、铁道三个部，最近分别建立了共同促进大跃进的协作关系，他们或者自动召开协作会议，或者登门访问，交换协作条件，三个部门之间决定今后要相互保证在煤炭方面做到产多少、销多少、运多少，互相承担义务，互相给予工作上的便利。在大跃进的形势下，运输量的增加给铁道部增加了繁重的任务，为了加强协作，铁道部专门召开了中央各部二十多个单位代表参加的货主会议，会上讨论了均衡运输问题，同时各部门还向铁道部提出了一百二十多条重要的批评和建议，特别要求铁道部改进某些规章制度过死过严的缺点。会后，铁道部对一些不合理的制度很快作了改进，例如为了保证及时把农业机械运到农村，及时把增产的煤炭运出矿山，这两种物资在运输计划以外提出要车计划时，铁路方面决定尽可能予以方便，拨给车辆，并根据具体条件免除罚款。在货主会议上，许多单位也都自动向铁道部提出了保证条件，粮食部的代表谈到粮食部过去有些粮食的调拨不合理，造成浪费。现在粮食部提出要尽量加强计划性，减少不合理的运输现象，使不合理的运输量从去年的18％降低到10％。
    整改运动的深入，使各部门的整风运动大大地超出了本部门的范围，各个环节之间要赶上先进，达到新的平衡，这就必须开门整风，主动地同上下左右加强联系，建立新的协作。
