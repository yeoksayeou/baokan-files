    What Does It Mean to Be "Responsible"?
    Song Shixi, Lanzhou Refinery

    In the pipeline construction of our refinery, the chief engineer once decided to use seamed steel pipes instead of seamless steel pipes. Based on their experience, the workers believed that seamed pipes could not replace seamless pipes and raised their concerns to the workshop leaders. However, the workshop leaders believed that this was the chief engineer's decision and the worksite had no right to change it; the chief engineer would be responsible if anything went wrong. Moreover, the worksite was under tight deadlines, so it was decided to complete the task first. As a result, some projects were already installed. Some components were also prefabricated. Then, the chief engineer issued another order: "Seamed pipes cannot replace seamless pipes." So, the pipes were all cut off and sent back to the warehouse. The responsibility was naturally borne by the chief engineer, but the loss was borne by the entire country.
    This incident illustrates an important issue, namely, what attitude should be adopted towards responsibility and what should one ultimately be responsible for? Some people treat responsibility with the attitude of a master. What they are responsible for is the construction project and the property of the state. Therefore, no matter who issues the order, and no matter who will bear the responsibility in the future, as long as they discover that it is wrong and will cause losses, they should strive to change it, or at least raise their own opinions like the workers at the worksite, so that the leadership can better consider it. Others treat responsibility with the attitude of an employee. They are only responsible for the orders of superiors and for the so-called responsibility system. Therefore, even if they clearly see that this will cause losses, as long as they do not have to bear the future responsibility, they will still carry on "according to orders."
    The former should be advocated. Everyone should seriously treat their own responsibilities and not become irresponsible pests hiding behind the banners of the "responsibility system" and "superior orders."

### 怎样才算“负责”？

    怎样才算“负责”？
    兰州炼油厂  宋士锡
    我们炼油厂在管线施工中，总工程师曾决定用有缝钢管代替无缝钢管。工人们根据自己的经验，认为有缝管不能代替，并向工区领导上提出了意见。但是工区领导上认为，这是总工程师决定的，工地无权变更，错了自有总工程师负责。而且，工地任务又很紧，还是先完成任务再说。这样，就没有采纳工人的意见。结果，有的工程已安装好了。有的备件也预制好了，总工程师又来了命令：“有缝管不能代替无缝管。”于是，管子又全部割断，送回库里去了。责任自然是由总工程师负了，但损失却是整个国家的。
    这件事说明了一个重要问题，就是应该用什么态度对待责任和究竟应该对什么负责？有一种人是用主人翁的态度来对待责任，他们所要负责的是建设工程和国家财产，因此，不管是谁下的命令，也不管这样的责任将来由谁来负，只要他发觉这是错误，要造成损失，就要力求改变，起码也要像工地工人那样的提出自己的意见，让领导上来更好的考虑。另一种人是以雇佣者的态度来对待责任的。他们只是对上级的命令负责，对所谓的责任制度负责。因此，尽管明明看到这要造成损失，只要将来的责任不要他负担，他便还要“依命”干下去。
    应该提倡第一种。大家都来认真的对待自己的责任，而不要成为躲在“责任制”和“上级命令”牌子后面的不负责任的害虫。
