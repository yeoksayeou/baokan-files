Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd – Recently established in Jiangsu Province, more than 2,900 private agricultural secondary schools have begun classes, with over 150,000 graduates from previous higher primary school classes and agricultural cooperative members now attending secondary school.

In the process of developing private agricultural secondary schools, the masses in Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Yancheng and other areas with a weaker cultural foundation have shown a very high enthusiasm for running schools. Tongshan County in Xuzhou Prefecture has already established 151 agricultural secondary schools, with over 10,000 students enrolled. Jiangdu, Jiangyin, Suining and other counties have each established over 100 agricultural secondary schools. In Xinyi County, Xuzhou Prefecture, 98.3% of graduates from previous higher primary school classes are now in agricultural secondary schools.

These agricultural secondary schools, welcomed by the masses, were established through the masses' efforts to find solutions in every possible way. Some agricultural secondary schools are located within public primary schools, while others use public housing as classrooms. Whitewashing walls and repairing school buildings are all done by the farmers themselves. Many blackboards are made from old signboards and broken doors. Students bring their own desks and benches. Teachers include cadres sent to lower levels, high school graduates from the cooperatives, and nearby primary school teachers. School operating expenses and teacher salaries are paid from student tuition fees. Students are all engaged in part-time work and part-time study. In addition to teaching, teachers also participate in a certain amount of labor.

In terms of teaching staff, the southern Jiangsu region, with a better cultural foundation, will mobilize more than 2,000 high school graduates who are participating in production and self-study to go to the northern Jiangsu region, where there is a shortage of teachers, to participate in agricultural production while teaching in agricultural secondary schools. Jiangsu Normal College, Nanjing Normal College, Jiangsu Normal Junior College, Northern Jiangsu Normal Junior College, Jiangsu Institute of Education and other institutions of higher learning have also established agricultural secondary school teacher training classes to train agricultural secondary school teachers who are engaged in both farming and teaching.

Currently, agricultural secondary schools generally offer courses in politics, language, mathematics, and agricultural knowledge. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has entrusted the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture, Jiangsu Education Institute, and Nanjing Normal College to compile teaching materials according to the nature of agricultural secondary schools. The political courses in agricultural secondary schools are concurrently taught by the district and township Party committee secretaries. All courses in agricultural secondary schools will be completed within three years. Xinhua Bookstore Jiangsu Branch, Jiangsu People's Publishing House and related departments are currently rushing to publish agricultural secondary school textbooks.

    发展农业中学为生产跃进服务
    江苏二千九百所民办中学开课
    新华社南京3日电　江苏省最近创办的二千九百多所民办农业中学已经开课，有十五万多以往各届高小毕业生和农业社社员上了中学。
    在发展民办农业中学过程中，文化基础较差的徐州、淮阴、盐城等专区的群众办学情绪十分高涨。徐州专区铜山县已经办了一百五十一所农业中学，有一万多人入学。江都、江阴、睢宁等县都已经办起农业中学一百所以上。徐州专区新沂县以往各届高小毕业生，现在已经有98.3％进了农业中学。
    这些受群众欢迎的农业中学都是群众千方百计想办法办起来的。有些农业中学设在公立小学内，有的利用公房作课堂。粉刷墙壁、拆修校舍都是农民自己动手。黑板很多是利用旧匾和破门改制的。课桌、凳子由学生自带。教师有的是下放干部，有的是社里的高中毕业生和附近的小学教师。学校办公费用、教师工资，在学生缴纳的学费中开支。学生都是半耕半读。教师除教学外，还参加一定的劳动。
    在师资方面，文化基础较好的苏南地区将动员两千多名参加生产和自学的高中毕业生到师资缺乏的苏北地区去，一面参加农业生产，一面在农业中学任教。江苏师范学院、南京师范学院、江苏师范专科学校、苏北师范专科学校、江苏教育学院等高等学校还分别举办农业中学师资训练班，培训半耕半教的农业中学教师。
    目前，农业中学普遍设政治、语文、数学和农业知识等课程。江苏省教育厅已委托江苏省农业厅、江苏教育学院、南京师范学院根据农业中学的性质编写教材。农业中学的政治课由各地的区、乡党委书记兼任。农业中学全部课程都将在三年内学完。现在新华书店江苏分店、江苏人民出版社和有关部门正在突击出版农业中学课本。
