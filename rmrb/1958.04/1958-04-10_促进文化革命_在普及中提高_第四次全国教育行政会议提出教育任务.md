Xinhua News Agency, April 9th - "Education workers must resolutely and bravely undertake the historical and political task of promoting the realization of the Cultural Revolution." This was stated by Dong Chuncai, Deputy Minister of Education, in his concluding remarks at the Fourth National Education Administrative Conference on the 8th. To promote the realization of the Cultural Revolution, he proposed completing five tasks: vigorously carrying out the literacy movement, eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, and actively developing spare-time secondary and primary schools for workers and peasants; vigorously popularizing primary school education so that the new generation can receive basic national education and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture; vigorously running agricultural secondary schools, industrial secondary schools, and handicraft secondary schools to train primary school graduates into new-type peasants and new-type workers with socialist consciousness, culture, and labor skills, while also developing ordinary secondary schools and improving the quality of secondary education to lay a solid foundation for higher education to train specialized construction talents and improve the country's cultural and scientific level; strengthening and improving teacher training at all levels, cultivating a contingent of teachers from the working class who are both red and expert, and transforming existing teachers into people's teachers who are both red and expert to meet the needs of the development of primary and secondary education; reforming the education system, education content, and education methods according to the educational policy proposed by Chairman Mao of cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.

Dong Chuncai said that following the high tide of economic construction, a new situation of a great leap forward in education has emerged, and this new situation has put forward two major requirements: cultural popularization and education reform.

In his concluding remarks, Dong Chuncai emphasized a new problem that has emerged after the great leap forward in education: the relationship between popularization and improvement. He said that now it is necessary to have both popularization and improvement. Improvement should be based on popularization, and popularization should be guided by improvement. Popularization is to meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of people for culture; improvement is to meet the needs of the country to improve its cultural and scientific level and catch up with the international level. Dong Chuncai said that launching literacy education, popularizing primary school education, and developing various types of private secondary schools, especially private vocational secondary schools, are all for the purpose of popularization; on the other hand, in order to lay a solid foundation for higher education and the development of the country's culture and science, ordinary primary and secondary schools, especially public primary and secondary schools, should have higher requirements so that they have higher quality. He emphasized that both popularization and improvement are necessary, and neither should be neglected. From a national perspective, the work of popularization has just begun, so the current focus should be on popularization first, and after achieving popularization, consolidation and improvement should follow closely.

When talking about several issues in the reform of general education, Dong Chuncai said that combining work and study and part-work part-study is an important measure to implement the educational policy of cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. Through the implementation of this education system, education can be combined with production, theory can be combined with practice, and mental labor can be combined with physical labor. He said that schools take education and learning as their main tasks, and the measures schools take serve the educational purpose of cultivating laborers. Therefore, public schools must implement combining work and study and engage in physical labor, but the labor should be appropriate. Public primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools are generally not required to be economically self-sufficient; private agricultural secondary schools, other vocational secondary schools, and private ordinary secondary schools can implement part-work part-study and strive for economic self-sufficiency. Dong Chuncai said that after schools implement combining work and study, learning, work, and rest should be properly planned and arranged to ensure that none are neglected. In terms of innovating and strengthening political and ideological education in schools, he emphasized that students must be educated with socialist ideology, which is a "red line" running through all aspects of school education and is the soul and commander of school education.

Dong Chuncai also pointed out that to promote the great leap forward in education and realize cultural popularization, it is necessary to rely closely on the leadership of the Party and resolutely implement the mass line.

The conference was held in Beijing from March 24th to April 8th. During the conference, representatives from various regions widely exchanged typical experiences in popularizing primary schools, eliminating illiteracy, developing agricultural secondary schools in large numbers, and schools carrying out work-study programs. The experience of Henan Province in popularizing primary school education by mobilizing the whole Party and running schools by the whole people, the experience of Dengfeng County in Henan Province in eliminating illiteracy throughout the county through the literacy movement of "ten thousand people teaching, the whole people learning," the experience of Jiangsu Province in developing agricultural secondary schools in large numbers, and the experience of Zhengzhou No. 7 Junior Middle School in Henan Province and Hulan Match Factory Private Junior Middle School in Heilongjiang Province in implementing the educational policy of cultivating laborers and carrying out work-study programs were all valued by the representatives attending the meeting.

The conference discussed the new situation of the great leap forward in national education. In order to meet the needs of popularizing primary schools and developing secondary schools in various regions, the conference discussed how to adopt various methods to cultivate and improve teachers.

The conference also discussed important issues in education reform.

Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng spoke at the closing meeting. He pointed out that this conference was a meeting of great ideological liberation, exchanged experiences, and clarified that the great leap forward in education must rely on walking on two "legs," that is, on the one hand, it is necessary to popularize, and on the other hand, it is necessary to pay attention to improvement. He pointed out that a series of new problems that have emerged in education reform under the new situation should be solved realistically according to the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and adopting the working method of coming from the masses and going to the masses.

    促进文化革命　在普及中提高
    第四次全国教育行政会议提出教育任务
    新华社9日讯　“教育工作者要坚决地、勇敢地担负起促进文化革命的实现这一项有重大意义的历史任务和政治任务。”这是教育部副部长董纯才8日在第四次全国教育行政会议作总结发言时说的。要促进文化革命的实现，他提出要完成五项任务：大力开展识字运动，扫除青壮年中的文盲，同时积极发展工农业余中学和小学；大力普及小学教育，使新生一代都能受到国民基础教育，成为有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者，大力举办农业中学、工业中学和手工业中学，把小学毕业生培养成有社会主义觉悟、有文化而又有劳动技能的新型农民和新型工人，同时发展普通中学，提高中学教育质量，为高等教育培养专门建设人才和提高国家的文化科学水平打下坚实的基础；加强和改进各级师范教育，培养工人阶级的又红又专的教师队伍，并且把现有教师改造成为又红又专的人民教师，以适应中小学教育发展的需要；根据毛主席提出的培养有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者的教育方针来改革教育制度、教育内容和教育方法。
    董纯才说，紧跟着经济建设的高潮，已经出现了教育大跃进的新局面，这个新局面提出了文化普及和教育改革的两大要求。
    董纯才在总结发言中，强调提出了教育大跃进以后出现的一个新问题：普及和提高的关系问题。他说，现在是一要普及，二要提高。要在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。普及是为了满足广大人民当前对文化的迫切要求；提高是为了适应国家要提高文化科学水平、赶上国际水平的需要。董纯才说，展开识字教育，普及小学教育，发展民办中学，特别是民办职业中学等多种多样的教育，都是为了普及；另一方面，为高等教育和发展国家的文化科学打下坚实基础，对于普通中小学，特别是公办中小学要有较高的要求，使它们有更高的质量。他强调既要普及又要提高，两者不可偏废。从全国范围来说，目前普及工作还刚刚开始，所以当前首先要着重普及，在实现普及之后，就要紧跟着巩固提高。
    董纯才在谈到普通教育改革中的几个问题时说，勤工俭学、半工半读是贯彻培养有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者的教育方针的一项重要措施。通过这种教育制度的实施，可以使教育同生产结合起来，理论与实际结合起来，脑力劳动同体力劳动结合起来。他说，学校以教育和学习为主要任务，学校采取这个措施是服务于培养劳动者这个教育目的。因此公立学校必须实行勤工俭学，要作体力劳动，可是劳动要适当。对公立中小学和师范学校一般不要求经济自给；民办农业中学、其他职业中学和民办普通中学，可以实行半工半读，争取经济自给。董纯才说，学校实行勤工俭学以后，学习、劳动和休息应该妥善地作统筹安排，做到三不误。在革新和加强学校政治思想教育方面，他强调指出，必须以社会主义思想教育学生，这是贯穿在学校教育各个方面的一根“红线”，是学校教育的灵魂、统帅。
    董纯才还指出，要促进教育大跃进，实现文化普及，必须紧紧依靠党的领导，坚决贯彻群众路线。
    这次会议从3月24日到4月8日在北京举行的。会议期间，各地代表广泛交流了普及小学、扫除文盲、大量发展农业中学，以及学校开展勤工俭学活动等方面的典型经验。河南省采取全党动员、全民办学的群众运动的方法普及小学教育的经验，河南省登封县以民教民、发动“万人教，全民学”的识字运动扫除全县文盲的经验，江苏省大量发展农业中学的经验，河南省郑州第七初级中学、黑龙江省呼兰火柴厂民办初级中学等学校贯彻培养劳动者的教育方针，开展勤工俭学、半工半读的经验，都受到到会代表的重视。
    会议座谈了全国教育工作大跃进的新形势。为了适应各地普及小学和发展中学的需要，会议讨论了如何采取多种多样的办法，来培养和提高师资的问题。
    会议也讨论了在教育改革方面的重要问题。
    教育部部长杨秀峰在闭幕会上讲话。他指出这次会议是一次思想大解放的会议，交流了经验，明确了教育大跃进必须依靠两条“腿”走路，就是一方面要普及，另一方面要注意提高。他指出在新形势下，教育改革中出现的一系列的新问题，应该根据多快好省的方针，采取从群众中来到群众中去的工作方法，实事求是地去解决。
