The same cadre, under the leadership of A, is vigorous and completes various tasks excellently; but under the leadership of B, he is timid and cannot do anything well. Why is this? The problem often lies in the different leadership ideologies and methods of A and B. A is good at "boosting" the morale of the cadres he leads, while B does the opposite, often intentionally or unintentionally "discouraging" them.

"Boosting" the morale of the cadres one leads should be a basic requirement for comrades doing leadership work. "Boosting" means pointing out the direction of work to the cadres, pointing out the specific path to reach this direction, and giving them various kinds of care when they encounter difficulties on the way forward. This kind of "boosting" is more powerful than any other kind of support. In front of such a leader, even a very ordinary person can create miracles. Let's take a recent event as proof. There are many reasons why Ma Jingyun, a welder at the Welding Research Office of the Metallurgical Industry Ministry's Building Research Institute, was able to create a new technology with international significance—friction welding; but the most important reason is that the organization gave him strong support, allocated him experimental funds, and encouraged him when he suffered failures.

But we can often see some leaders who, when it is particularly necessary to "boost" the morale of cadres, often do not "boost" it, but "discourage" it. There is such an example: When a certain place held a meeting to discuss whether it could increase production according to the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program, the cadres from below all said they could, but a leading comrade insisted that they could not, and even when others cited typical materials as proof, this leading comrade said: "Typical examples are typical examples, we cannot start from typical examples, we must start from the overall situation." What is starting from the overall situation? In a word, it means that this requirement cannot be achieved. After hearing the words of this leading comrade, the cadres who were originally full of energy suddenly became discouraged (of course, it is wrong for these cadres to be discouraged, and they are also somewhat spoiled).

Failure and success in work are common occurrences. Success and failure are the unity of opposites; where there is success, there is failure, success includes failure, and failure includes success; the old saying "failure is the mother of success" is precisely this meaning. However, some leaders can only have success and cannot have failure. As soon as there is a failure, they panic and shout: "This thing cannot be done!" "If we do it again, we will make a mistake!" In addition to retreating themselves, they also want their subordinates to hang up "no war" signs. Such leaders can only "discourage" cadres.

Some people will say: These cannot be called discouragement, but a necessary modesty and prudence. Modesty is different from "discouragement." Modest people do not exaggerate personal roles, nor do they underestimate their own strength, especially the strength of the collective; modest people often create many miracles. People who like to discourage others always underestimate their own strength, especially the strength of the collective, and such people will never do anything earth-shattering. Discouragement is not caution. It is necessary for cautious people to conduct in-depth investigations and repeated research before doing things. Only in this way can they be unstoppable and courageous when they do things. However, people who like to discourage others neither investigate nor dare to move forward bravely.

It needs to be explained here that correct criticism from the leadership towards cadres should not be regarded as discouragement. Correct criticism is the most practical "boost." Taking the criticism of false reporting and shouting slogans as an example, if this phenomenon is not corrected, all advanced indicators will fall through. Therefore, criticism of this phenomenon is correct, and it is to change false reporting and shouting slogans to factual reporting and shouting slogans.

Discouragement is bad, and it is even worse for a leader to discourage people. Discourage whose morale? Discouraging the morale of socialism, discouraging the morale of revolution! Why do these leaders discourage the morale of socialism? Why do they discourage the morale of revolution? This is because they are full of bureaucratic and stagnant air, cannot see the beautiful prospects, cannot see the infinite creativity of cadres and the people, and can only see a small piece of heaven and earth under their noses.

    谈泄气
    梅耳
    同样一个干部，在甲领导之下，朝气勃勃，出色地完成了各项任务；但在乙领导之下，则畏首畏尾，什么工作都做不好。这是为什么呢？问题往往发生在甲乙两种不同的领导思想和领导方法上，甲是善于给自己所领导的干部“鼓气”，而乙则恰恰相反，经常有意无意地使干部“泄气”。
    给自己所领导的干部“鼓气”，应当是做领导工作同志的一个起码条件。所谓“鼓气”，也就是给干部指出工作方向，给干部指出达到这个方向的具体道路，当干部在前进途中遇到困难的时候，还给他们以各种各样的关怀。这种“鼓气”，比任何方面的支持都有力量。在这样的领导者面前，即使一个很平凡的人，也会创造出奇迹来。举最近发生的一件事情来证明。冶金工业部建筑研究院焊接研究室焊工马景云所以能够创造具有国际水平意义的新技术——摩擦焊接法，是有许多原因的；但是其中最重要的一个原因是组织上给了他以有力的支持，拨给他试验经费，在他遭受失败的时候，给他以鼓励。
    但是我们常常可以看到这样一些领导者，在特别需要给干部“鼓气”的时候，却往往不是给以“鼓气”，而是给以“泄气”。就有这样一个例子：某地开会讨论能不能按照全国农业发展纲要的要求增产的时候，从下边来的干部都说能，一位领导同志却坚持说不能，甚至在别人举出典型材料作证明时，这位领导同志还说：“典型是典型，不能从典型出发，要从全面出发。”什么是从全面出发呢？一句话，就是这个要求不能实现。听了这位领导同志的话，原来是干劲十足的干部，一下子都泄了气（当然这些干部泄气是不对的，也多少有些娇气）。
    工作中的失败和成功，这是常事。成功和失败是对立面的统一，有成功就有失败，成功中包括失败，失败中包括成功；古语“失败乃成功之母”，也正是这个意思。可是有些领导者却只能有成功，不能有失败，一有失败，就惊慌失措，就大叫大喊：“这件事情可办不得！”“再办要犯错误！”他们除了自己打“退堂鼓”外，还要下级干部挂起“免战牌”。这样的领导者，也只能使干部“泄气”。
    有人会说：这些都不能叫做泄气，而是一种必要的谦虚和谨慎。谦虚和“泄气”不同，谦虚的人不夸大个人作用，也不低估自己的力量特别是集体的力量；谦虚的人，常常创造出许多奇迹。而好泄气的人从来都低估自己的力量特别是集体的力量，这样的人，也永远作不出惊天动地的事情来。泄气也不是谨慎，谨慎的人在做事情之前要深入调查，反复研究，这是必要的。只有这样，他们做起事情来才能势如破竹，勇不可当。而好泄气的人，则既不调查研究，也不敢勇往直前。
    在这里需要说明的，领导上对于干部的正确的批评，不能当作泄气。正确的批评，是最实际的“鼓气”。拿批评虚报虚喊现象来说，这种现象如不予以纠正，一切先进指标都会落空。因此对这种现象的批评是正确的，是为了改虚报虚喊为实报实喊。
    泄气是不好的，一个领导者使人泄气就更不好。泄什么人的气呢？泄社会主义的气，泄革命的气！这些领导人为什么要泄社会主义的气？为什么要泄革命的气？这是因为他们官气暮气满身，看不到美丽的远景，看不到干部和人民中无穷的创造力，而只能看到鼻子底下一小块天地。
