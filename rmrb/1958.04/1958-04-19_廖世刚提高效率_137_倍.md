Youth miller Liao Shigang of Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory recently achieved a major technological innovation. He changed the processing of sewing machine positioning rods from milling machines to punch presses, instantly increasing production efficiency by 137 times.

On the 12th, more than 300 advanced producers, technicians, and workshop directors from factories and mines in Chongqing listened to Liao Shigang's experience introduction and visited his innovative technology demonstration.

At the beginning of February this year, Liao Shigang proposed a plan to complete the equivalent of five years of work in four months. After the city's employees followed his example, he repeatedly revised his plan. By the end of March, he decided to bring forward his revised plan—completing the equivalent of five years of work in two months and seven days. Through diligent research, he finally successfully tested a new method of processing sewing machine positioning rods, changing from milling machines to punch presses.

    廖世刚提高效率137倍
    重庆建设机床厂青年铣工廖世刚，最近实现了一项重大的技术革新。他把缝纫机定位杆由铣床加工改为冲床加工，一下就把生产效率提高了一百三十七倍。
    12日，重庆各厂矿有三百多个先进生产者、技术工人、车间主任等听了廖世刚的经验介绍，并参观了他革新技术的表演。
    今年2月初廖世刚曾提出以四个月的时间完成相当于五年工作量的计划。全市职工纷纷向他看齐以后，他又一再修改计划，到3月底，他决定把他修改后的计划——两个月零七天完成相当于五年的工作量，再提前一步。他刻苦钻研终于试验成功了把缝纫机定位杆由铣床加工改为冲床加工的新方法。　（据新华社讯）
