The U.S. propaganda machine – the United States Information Service – after the Soviet Union’s reply on the 11th to the Western Three Powers' suggestion to hold an ambassador-level meeting, said regarding the U.S. State Department's reaction, "The Soviet Union has accepted the suggestion by the United States, Britain, and France to hold diplomatic negotiations this month to prepare for a summit meeting.” However, a few minutes later, this message was withdrawn and replaced with another saying, "The Soviet reply clearly did not accept the West's suggestion." In just a few minutes, the Soviet reply was still the same reply, but the U.S. government went back on its word, changing from "accepting" to the completely opposite "not accepting." This, apart from exposing the U.S. ruling clique’s utter panic in the face of the Soviet Union’s sincere efforts to promote a summit meeting, proves once again that the United States is an obstructionist and saboteur of summit meetings.

    出尔反尔
    美国宣传机器——美国新闻处在11日就苏联致西方三国建议举行大使级会议的复照后，美国国务院的反应说，“苏联已经接受美国、英国、法国提出的关于在本月举行外交谈判来准备最高级会议的建议。”可是，过了几分钟，又撤销了这条消息，另发一条消息说：“苏联的答复显然没有接受西方的这项建议。”仅隔几分钟，苏联的复照还是原来的那个复照，美国政府却出尔反尔，从“接受”变成完全相反的“没有接受”。这除了暴露美国统治集团在苏联竭力促进最高级会议的诚意面前感到万分慌乱外，再一次证明美国是最高级会议的阻挠和破坏者。
