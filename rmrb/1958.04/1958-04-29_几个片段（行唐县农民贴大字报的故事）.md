Several Snippets
(Stories of Farmers in Xingtang County Posting Big-Character Posters)
    Members of the Xichengzi Cooperative posted a big-character poster to the accountant, saying:
    "Yang Decai, consider this, everyone elected you to be the accountant. Coming to work late, leaving early, using work hours for your private plot. If this attitude doesn't change, we'll remove you as accountant."
    From then on, Yang Decai went to work early and returned late, working on the accounts until late at night. The accounts became clear, and the masses were satisfied.
    In Chu Hou Village, Shangbei Township, there was a well-to-do middle peasant, Wang Luozhu, who had forgotten his roots after emancipation. He posted a big-character poster saying:
    "Four hundred catties of grain a year isn't enough to eat, at least three catties of cotton batting are needed, and each person should get four zhang of cloth coupons. Joining the cooperative is not as good as going it alone."
    Cooperative member Xiao Wenyi immediately posted a big-character poster refuting his forgetful and ungrateful thinking, saying:
    "Listen, Luozhu, listen to what I say, look at the past and think about the present. In the past, you trod on other people's land and were under other people's control. Working as a hired hand, you earned no money; paying rent, you bore interest. The land is evenly distributed, with houses and land, and life in the cooperative is sweeter than sweet. This year, you've been allocated enough for all your expenses for the whole year, plus an extra one hundred and three work points (money). Who gave you these things? Don't forget the pain once the wound heals."
    When Wang Luozhu heard that someone had posted a big-character poster about him, he hurriedly found someone to read it to him. Once, twice, he listened three times in a row. He cried and said, "I was wrong. The big-character poster pulled me back onto the right path. I will work hard to make a good impression and repay the Communist Party."
    In Shanglian Village, there was a farmer who was working individually named Liu Shan. In the past, when others tried to persuade him to join the cooperative, he said, "Don't bother, in the future, individual households will become rare and valuable, and I'm even planning to sell tickets to people to see me." Recently, cooperative member Wang Jianzhong posted a big-character poster to him, saying: "Liu Shan, listen to me, it's really difficult to go it alone. The cooperative uses fertilizer carts, but you carry manure with a carrying pole; the cooperative uses oxen to plow the land, but you use a hoe to turn the soil. Liu Shan, Liu Shan, join the cooperative, it's warm in the big family." Not long after this big-character poster was posted, Liu Shan made up his mind to join the cooperative.

    几个片段
    （行唐县农民贴大字报的故事）
    西城子社社员们给会计贴出大字报说：
    “杨得才，你考虑，大伙选你当会计。迟上班，早回去，工作时间忙自留地。这个态度不转变，把你会计撤下去。”
    从这以后，杨得才早去、晚归，弄账直到深夜。账目清楚了，群众满意了。
    上碑乡初后村有一个翻身忘本的富裕中农王洛竹，曾经贴出一张大字报说：
    “一年吃粮四百也不够，絮棉至少得三斤，布票每人该四丈，入社不如单干强。”
    社员萧文义马上贴出大字报反驳他的忘本思想说：
    “叫洛竹，你听言，看看如今想从前。过去脚踏人家地，头顶人家天。作长工，不挣钱；交租子，扛利钱。土地平分有房又有地，入社生活甜上甜。今年你把全年消费都分够，另外工分一百三（款）。这些东西谁给的，疮好忘疼可不沾。”
    王洛竹听说有人给他贴了大字报，忙找人念给他听。一遍，两遍，一连听了三遍。他哭了，说：“我错了。大字报把我拉回正道上来了。我要好好干出个样子来，报答共产党。”
    上连庄有个单干农民名刘山，过去别人劝他入社时，他却说：“别费心了，以后单干户成了缺为贵，我还准备卖票给人看哩。”最近，社员王建中给他贴出一张大字报说：“刘山听我言，单干实在难。社内肥料马车运，你用扁担把粪担；社里耕地套大牛，你用镢头把地翻。刘山刘山入社吧，大家庭里多温暖。”这张大字报贴出不久，刘山便下决心入社了。
