    Reported by our correspondent Gong Ce: The Central State Organs Party Committee is currently inspecting and correcting the tendency to neglect politics – focusing only on "practicalities" (业务, yu wu - business) and not on "ideology" (思想理论, si xiang li lun - thought and theory) in the in-depth debates and rectification. How to learn to "focus on ideology" and how to grasp the fundamental political and ideological issues to conduct in-depth debates and rectifications is a key issue related to the success or failure of the current rectification movement.
    In the past, there was a relatively serious shortcoming in the leadership work of the central state organs: only "focusing on practicalities" and not "focusing on ideology." This situation refers to some leading cadres only grasping business and technology, only grasping indicators and figures, failing to grasp the soul of business work, and not paying attention to studying principles, policies, and theoretical ideas. This bad tendency seriously hindered the liberation of leadership thinking and restricted the development of the masses' enthusiasm and creativity.
    In the recent in-depth debates, the Central State Organs Party Committee found that this shortcoming had not been fundamentally changed in some units. Instead of focusing on resolving political and ideological issues through great debates, they were dealing with matters as they stood, discussing the "program" (纲, gang - guideline) as it was, without grasping political ideology from the "program." They were unable to accurately identify or grasp the key and essential issues; there was more "overthrowing" of specific issues and less "overthrowing" of ideological issues. The leading cadres of some organs were clueless about what kind of thinking to "overthrow" and what kind of thinking to "establish." Some even believed that "establishing" could be done without "overthrowing," that formulating a leap forward plan would be sufficient, and that a great leap forward was not being organized on the basis of deeply resolving political and ideological issues – not focusing on ideology before focusing on practicalities, or overthrowing the old on a grand scale before establishing the new. The Party Committee believes that the main reason for these phenomena is that some leading cadres are still adopting a superficial leadership approach to the movement, without going deep to seriously discover and solve problems.
    Some advanced units in the rectification movement have adopted the approach of first "focusing on ideology" and then "focusing on practicalities," and the effect has been very good. The Central State Organs Party Committee is promoting their experience. During the great debate, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry called for "everyone to talk about thought, everyone to talk about politics," requiring all departments to deeply excavate the roots of the dominant erroneous thoughts. Based on the criticisms raised by the masses during the great airing of views, the ministry is focusing on criticizing conservative thought and dogmatic work styles, as well as the phenomenon of some veteran cadres being expert but not red. In order to hit the key points, the ministry requires that these erroneous thoughts be specifically analyzed and criticized. For example, the Planning Department's criticism of dogmatism focuses on examining the erroneous thoughts of only caring about the central government and not the local governments, and not "combining large, medium, and small [enterprises]," criticizing the erroneous arguments of mechanical "equilibrium theory" and "system construction theory." When criticizing dogmatism, the Finance Department exposed the erroneous practices of "system supremacy" and "supervision supremacy" in leadership thinking. The "Open Hearth Furnace Safety Regulations" formulated by the Security Bureau were as long as 32,000 characters, and the provisions of the regulations were cumbersome and impractical, prominently demonstrating the seriousness of the dogmatic work style. Once this problem was exposed, the staff and workers of the organs expressed their criticisms one after another, believing that this regulation reflected the cadres' thinking of only believing in regulations and systems, and not believing in the masses or in political and ideological work. Now the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry proposes to launch a wave of ideological great debate and ideological great liberation throughout the entire ministry, and then debate the leap forward plan and measures to realize the plan on the basis of "focusing on ideology." To achieve this, it is required that the top leaders of each unit personally take charge and conduct specific leadership.
    At the recent four-level cadre meeting held by the Ministry of Coal Industry, the approach of first "focusing on ideology" and then "focusing on practicalities," first "overthrowing" and then "establishing" was adopted, which enabled the cadres attending the meeting to open up their thinking and truly grasp the key and essential issues in their work. At the beginning of the meeting, the leaders of the ministry led the way by drawing fire on themselves, guiding everyone to freely air their views. More than 600 cadres attending the meeting posted more than 28,000 big-character posters. They criticized the leaders of the ministry for attaching importance only to matters and not to people, and for paying attention only to "numbers plus technology" in their leadership work. When going down to inspect work, they sat in the office to look at charts, only listened to business reports, and did not ask about political and ideological matters. The big-character posters sharply pointed out that this was an extremely abnormal phenomenon of "leadership lacking a soul and systems usurping the command." Over the past ten days or so, after two stages of airing views and debating, they deeply excavated the roots of conservative thought, uncovered the "secrets" of conservatism, and criticized various erroneous arguments. For example, in the field of capital construction, they criticized the long-standing "only objective conditions" theory, the "waste is inevitable" theory, and the "more, faster means not better, more economical" theory. In the field of production, they criticized the pessimistic theory that old mines were "born deficient and acquired imbalanced," and the absolute "contradiction theory" between production and safety, need and possibility, and so on. The essence of these arguments is the reflection of mechanical materialism in the current practical life. In order to further destroy these erroneous "theories," the leaders of the ministry first set an example by conducting profound self-examinations, which influenced the cadres attending the meeting to also conduct self-examinations on their own initiative, and everyone's thinking was liberated. They said that in the past, people did not tell the truth in meetings, and the lower levels used conservatism to deal with the bureaucracy of the upper levels. The meetings formed "accounting plus arguing, bargaining." This time, at the meeting, the "commander returned to his position," the upper and lower levels exchanged their hearts, said what they wanted to say, and felt comfortable. On the basis of liberating thought and raising awareness, the meeting finally discussed in depth the issue of organizing a great leap forward in production and construction in 1958.
    When cadres of the Rubber Bureau of the Ministry of Chemical Industry conducted debates on the trial production of new products, they avoided debates on purely technical issues and focused on exposing the various manifestations and ideological roots of conservative thought in this work. For example, the masses criticized the bureau for often imposing various restrictions on the relevant departments when they requested the trial production of new products, which showed that the implementation of the national technical policy of increasing new varieties was not promoting but hindering. From this debate, they found that in the past, many people had delved into the economic and technical fields and lost the soul of technical work. As a result, the question of "serving whom" for the rubber industry, which is a very dependent industrial sector, had not been truly resolved for a long time. The Second Ministry of Commerce recently convened a sugar and pastry professional conference, adopting the method of "talking about politics and thought first, then doing business," which improved the thinking of the representatives. They believed that in the past, many people in the commercial sector only circled around the five characters of "purchase, sale, transfer, storage, and profit," and their thinking was greatly restricted. Now they realize that strengthening commercial work is of great significance for promoting balance and coordination in the great leap forward. At the meeting, the representatives promoted the spirit of mutual cooperation and mutual support between production and sales, and between urban and rural areas from the perspective of promoting the requirements of the great leap forward in production, and many business contradictions were quickly resolved.
    The situation of these advanced units shows that at this final juncture of the rectification movement, truly putting politics in command and grasping the soul of business work to conduct in-depth debates is of great significance for liberating the thinking of leaders and the masses and promoting the great leap forward in production and construction.

### 先“务虚”后“务实”大破大立  中央国家机关党委纠正深入辩论中忽视政治的偏向

    先“务虚”后“务实”大破大立
    中央国家机关党委纠正深入辩论中忽视政治的偏向
    本报讯　记者宫策报道：中央国家机关党委最近正在检查和纠正深入辩论和整改中只“务实”（业务）不“务虚”（思想理论）的忽视政治的倾向。怎样学会“务虚”，怎样抓住根本的政治思想问题来深入进行争辩和整改，这是关系当前整风运动成败的一个关键性问题。
    过去，在中央国家机关的领导工作上存在比较严重的只“务实”不“务虚”的缺点，这种情况是指有些领导干部在工作中只抓业务技术，只抓指标数字，抓不住业务工作中的灵魂，不重视研究方针政策和理论思想，这种不良的倾向，严重地阻碍了领导思想的解放，束缚了群众积极性和创造性的发扬。
    在最近的深入辩论中，中央国家机关党委发现有些单位这种缺点并没有根本改变，没有通过大辩论来着重解决政治思想问题，而是就事论事，就纲论纲，没有从“纲”里抓住政治思想，对于关键和本质问题看不准，抓不住；具体问题“破”的多，思想问题“破”的少，有些机关的辩论并且纯粹陷入了事务性、技术性问题的探讨中；有些机关的领导干部对于“破”什么思想，“立”什么思想，心中无数；有的甚至认为不“破”也可以“立”，认为订出一个跃进规划就可以了，没有在深入解决政治思想问题的基础上来组织大跃进，不是务虚而后务实，大破而后大立。党委会认为，出现这些现象的主要原因是有些领导干部对于运动至今还是采取表面化的领导方式，没有深入下去认真地发现和解决问题。
    整风运动中的一些先进单位，采取先“务虚”而后“务实”的作法，效果很好，中央国家机关党委正在推广它们的经验。冶金工业部在大辩论中，号召“人人谈思想，个个谈政治”，要求各部门深入地挖掘主导的错误思想根子。这个部根据群众在大鸣大放中提出的批评，正在集中地批判保守思想和教条主义作风，以及一些老干部专而不红的现象。为了击中要害，部里要求对于这些错误思想都要进行具体的分析和批判，例如计划司对于教条主义的批判，着重检查只管中央不管地方、“大中小不结合”的错误思想，批判机械的“平衡论”和“系统建设论”等错误论调；财务司在批判教条主义时，揭发了领导思想上的“制度至上”、“监督至上”的错误作法；安全局制定的“平炉安全规程”长达三万二千字，规程的条文繁琐而不切实际，突出地表现了教条主义作风的严重，这个问题一经揭发，机关职工群众都纷纷提出了批评意见，认为从这个规程中反映了这个局的干部思想上只相信章程制度，不相信群众，不相信政治思想工作。现在冶金部提出，要在全部内掀起思想大辩论、思想大解放的热潮，在“务虚”的基础上然后辩论跃进的规划和实现规划的措施；为了做到这一点，要求各单位的第一把手都要亲自上阵，进行具体领导。
    煤炭部在最近举行的四级干部会议上，采取先“务虚”后“务实”先“破”而后“立”的作法，使到会的干部打开了思路，真正抓到了工作中的关键问题和本质问题。这个会议一开始，部的领导就引火烧身，引导大家大鸣大放，出席会议的六百多干部共贴出了二万八千多张大字报，他们批评部的领导只重事，不重人，领导工作只注意“数字加技术”，下去检查工作时坐在办公室里看图表，只听业务汇报，不问政治思想；大字报尖锐地指出，这是“领导缺乏灵魂，制度篡夺统帅”的极不正常的现象。十多天来，经过鸣放和争辩两个阶段，他们深刻地挖掘了保守思想的根源，揭开了保守的“秘密”，批判了各种错误的论调，例如在基本建设工作方面，批判了长期以来存在的“唯客观条件”论、“浪费不可避免”论、“多快就不能好省”论；在生产工作方面，批判了那种认为旧矿井“先天不足，后天失调”的悲观论，批判了生产和安全、需要和可能的绝对“矛盾论”，等等。这些论调的实质都是机械唯物主义思想在当前实际生活中的反映。为了进一步摧毁这些错误的“理论”，部的领导首先起榜样作用，进行了深刻的检查，这样也就影响到会干部也都自动进行了自我检查，大家的思想解放了。他们说，过去开会上下不说真话，下面以保守来对付上面的官僚，会议形成“算账加吵嘴，讨价还价”；这次开会“统帅归了位”，上下交了心，有什么说什么，心情舒畅了；在解放思想、提高思想的基础上，会议最后深入地讨论了组织1958年生产和建设大跃进的问题。
    化工部橡胶局的干部在进行关于新产品试制工作的辩论时，避免了纯技术性问题的争辩，着重揭发了这一工作中保守思想的种种表现和思想根源，例如群众批评了这个局过去对有关部门要求试制新产品时，往往进行种种限制，表现了对于国家增加新品种的技术政策的贯彻，不是促进，而是促退；从这个辩论中，他们发现过去很多人钻到经济技术领域里，丢掉了技术工作的灵魂，结果长期以来对于橡胶工业这个从属性很大的工业部门“为谁服务”的问题并没有真正解决。第二商业部最近召开了糖业糕点专业会议，采取“先讲政治、谈思想，后做买卖”的办法，使代表们的思想得到了提高。他们认为，过去商业部门很多人只在“购、销、调、存、赚”五个字上兜圈子，思想受到很大的束缚；现在他们认识到，加强商业工作，对于促进大跃进中的平衡和协作有着重大的意义。会议上，代表们从促进生产大跃进的要求出发，发挥了产销之间、城乡之间相互协作、相互支援的精神，许多业务上的矛盾很快解决了。
    这些先进单位的情况表明，在整风运动这个最后的关头，真正以政治挂帅、抓住业务工作中的灵魂来深入地进行辩论，对于解放领导和群众的思想，促进生产建设的大跃进有着重大的意义。
