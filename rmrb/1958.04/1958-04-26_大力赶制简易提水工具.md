Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: The State Council today issued a notice on relying on the masses to vigorously accelerate the production of simple water lifting tools. The full text is as follows:

Since last winter, under the leadership of Party and government at all levels, the broad masses of farmers have launched a magnificent upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction. According to statistics as of April 10th, various water conservancy projects completed in various regions can increase new irrigation areas by more than 300 million mu. This is a huge achievement unprecedented in history. In the current tense season of spring plowing and spring planting, it is a serious political task for leading organs at all levels to fully utilize the completed water conservancy projects, carry out timely irrigation, ensure full planting and strong seedlings, and enable the hundreds of millions of farmers to exchange the huge labor invested in water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation campaigns for a satisfactory harvest. Recently, some areas in Hebei, Gansu and other provinces have experienced varying degrees of drought; therefore, emergency measures must be taken to give full play to the irrigation benefits of various water conservancy facilities, carry out drought resistance to protect seedlings, and drought resistance to sow seeds.

Among the various water conservancy facilities, a considerable part needs to use water lifting tools for irrigation. In order to actively support agricultural production, the industrial sector can manufacture 650,000 horsepower of various power pumping machinery before June this year, but this figure is far from meeting the current needs of various regions for water lifting tools. This is a current difficulty we face. How to overcome this difficulty? Many regions such as Henan and Hebei have already set a good example. With high revolutionary vigor, they have adopted the working method of the mass line, looked downwards, resolutely relied on the masses, used the wisdom of the masses, actively encouraged the masses to create, and rushed to produce dozens, hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of simple water lifting tools, making, using and irrigating at the same time. These simple hand-made water lifting tools are characterized by being made of local materials, easy to manufacture, cheap, easy to use for everyone, and can be handled by every commune. The current mass movement for tool reform in agriculture and water conservancy is actually a mass agricultural technical revolution movement. It has strong vitality and broad prospects for development. At present, according to regional and seasonal requirements, a variety of rich and colorful improvement and manufacturing movements have been launched. Leading organs at all levels must overcome the idea of waiting for machines, treat the creations of the masses with revolutionary spirit, implement the policy of fully mobilizing the masses, and everything through experimentation, to achieve more, faster, better and more economical results. Therefore, when solving the problem of insufficient water lifting tools, all regions should rely on the masses, use local materials, adapt to local conditions, and vigorously accelerate the production of various simple water lifting tools as a major measure. At the same time, relevant departments such as local industry, handicrafts, and commerce should be organized to cooperate, link up with agricultural cooperatives, and adopt the method of exhibiting, improving, planning, and acting at the same time, actively manufacturing and applying them in a timely manner, and agricultural production must not suffer undue losses because of waiting for machines. The industrial sector must accelerate the manufacture of various power pumping machinery, ensure quality and quantity, and supply them in a timely manner to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. All regions must seize the training of pump operators and technicians to ensure that after the machines are sent to the countryside, each one has at least one to two skilled drivers. Agricultural machinery research institutions and machinery factory workers should organize technology to go to the countryside and mountains to support the farmers' agricultural tool reform movement, help farmers learn the use, maintenance and simple repair techniques of irrigation and drainage machinery, and form this work into a system.

We should also make every effort to tap the potential of existing irrigation and drainage machinery and give full play to its due effectiveness. Recently, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other provinces have advocated launching a socialist friendship competition for mechanical irrigation and drainage work nationwide, using the spirit of comparing advanced, learning from advanced, and catching up with advanced to promote each other and improve together. According to the indicators and measures they have put forward, it is entirely possible to increase the efficiency of irrigation and drainage machinery by more than double this year, which can save the country a lot of construction funds and steel raw materials. All regions should attach great importance to this, actively respond to their initiative, participate in the competition, and greatly improve the political ideology and professional level of mechanical irrigation and drainage work.

### 大力赶制简易提水工具

    大力赶制简易提水工具
    国务院通知中指出：当前广大群众在农业和水利方面的工具改革运动，实际上就是一个群众性的农业技术革命运动，它有强大的生命力和广阔的发展前途。各级领导机关必须以革命的精神对待群众的创造，贯彻充分发动群众，一切通过试验的方针，达到多快好省。各地在解决提水工具不足问题的时候，应当把大量赶制简易提水工具，作为一项主要措施。
    新华社25日讯　国务院在今天发出了关于依靠群众大力赶制简易提水工具的通知。全文如下：
    自去冬以来，广大农民群众在各级党政领导下，掀起了规模壮阔的兴修农田水利的高潮。截至四月十日的统计，各地已完成的各项水利工程，约可增加新的灌溉面积三亿余亩。这是历史上从未有过的巨大成绩。在当前春耕春种的紧张季节里，把已完成的各项水利工程充分运用起来，及时进行灌溉，保证满栽满插，苗全苗壮，使亿万农民群众在兴修水利和积肥运动中投入的巨大劳动，换来美满的丰收果实，是各级领导机关的一项严重的政治任务。最近，河北、甘肃等省的部分地区已出现不同程度的旱象；因之，必须采取紧急措施，充分发挥各项水利设施的灌溉效益，进行抗旱保苗，抗旱播种。
    在各项水利设施中，有相当一部分是要使用提水工具才能进行灌溉的。工业部门为了积极支援农业生产，在今年六月份以前，可制造出各种动力抽水机械六十五万马力，但是这个数字远不能满足当前各地对提水工具的需要。这是我们当前的一个困难。怎样克服这个困难呢？河南、河北等不少地区，已经作出了好榜样。他们以昂扬的革命干劲，采取群众路线的工作方法，眼睛向下看，坚决依靠群众，运用群众智慧，积极鼓励群众创造，赶制了几十种、几百种、几千种、几十万件的简易提水工具，边作边用边灌溉。这些简易手工提水工具的特点是就地取材，制造容易，价钱便宜，人人会用，社社能办。当前广大群众在农业和水利方面的工具改革运动，实际上就是一个群众性的农业技术革命运动，它有强大的生命力和广阔的发展前途，目前正根据地区性和季节性的要求，展开了多种多样丰富多采的改良和制造运动。各级领导机关必须克服等待机器的思想，以革命的精神对待群众的创造，贯彻充分发动群众，一切通过试验的方针，达到多快好省。因此，各地在解决提水工具不足问题的时候，应当把依靠群众，就地取材，因地制宜，大量赶制多种多样的简易提水工具，作为一项主要措施。同时应当组织地方工业、手工业、商业等有关部门进行协作，与农业社挂钩，采取边展览、边改进、边规划、边行动的办法，积极制造，及时应用，不能因为等待机器，使农业生产受到不应有的损失。工业部门则必须加速制造各种动力抽水机械，保质保量，及时供应，支援农业生产大跃进。各地要抓紧抽水机司机和技工的培训工作，保证机器下乡后，每一台至少有一至二名熟练的司机。农业机械研究机关和机械厂的职工应当组织技术下乡上山，支援农民的农具改革运动，帮助农民学会对排灌机械的使用保养和简单的修理技术，并且把这一工作形成为一种制度。
    对现有的排灌机械，也应当千方百计地挖掘潜力，充分发挥它们应有的效能。最近浙江、江苏等省倡议在全国范围内开展机械排灌工作社会主义友谊竞赛，以比先进、学先进、赶先进的精神，互相推动，共同提高。根据他们提出的指标和措施，完全有可能在今年把排灌机械的效益提高一倍以上，从而可以使国家节约大量建设资金和钢铁原材料，各地应当予以高度重视，积极响应他们的倡议，参加竞赛，把机械排灌工作的政治思想和业务水平，大大提高一步。
