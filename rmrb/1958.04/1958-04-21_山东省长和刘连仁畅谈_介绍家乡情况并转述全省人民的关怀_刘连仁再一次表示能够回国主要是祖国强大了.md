Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th April (Reporters Kang Ning and Ai Yun) - This morning, Zhao Jianmin, Governor of Shandong Province, and Vice Governors Wang Zhuoru and Liu Minsheng met with compatriot Liu Lianren in the Governor's office.

Liu Lianren appeared particularly happy and natural today. The cordial greetings and concern from the governors quickly dispelled the excited yet somewhat constrained expression he had been wearing in recent days. Governor Zhao Jianmin said to him warmly, "Welcome back to the embrace of the motherland, back to Shandong, and soon you will be back to your lovely hometown!" Perhaps Liu Lianren felt like he had already returned to his hometown; he spoke more than usual, and his speech became clearer and more fluent. He poured out his heart to the governors about his fourteen years of suffering in Japan, expressed his feelings and thoughts, and inquired with concern about the recent situation in his hometown.

After narrating his escape from death, Liu Lianren said with emotion, "Not to mention fourteen years, even a moment is unbearable! Now I have survived, but I understand better than anyone that if it were not for the strength of the motherland, I would have died there - if not in the mountains, they would have found me in the mountains and killed me. This time I was discovered, and the Japanese government still intended to harm me. The reason they didn't succeed is certainly not because they were afraid of me, but because they were afraid of our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where people are united and powerful!"

Governor Zhao Jianmin said, "After we learned of your information from the newspapers, we were very concerned about you. Later, when we saw the unreasonable attitude of the Japanese government, the people of Shandong were very angry!"

Liu Lianren immediately continued, "Good is good, and bad is bad. The Japanese farmers, ordinary people, and friendly organizations treated me very well. After they found me, they all went to see me and said they were sorry. I said we won't talk about the past; let's make friends again. When I left Japan, the Japanese people repeatedly told me to send their regards to all the Chinese people on their behalf!"

Speaking of the attitude of the Japanese government, Liu Lianren's face turned angry. He said, "The Japanese government shamelessly said that they hired me with money. I asked them how they hired me? How much money did they use to hire me?" Liu Lianren also talked about the despicable and shameless means used by the Kishi Nobusuke government against him before he returned to China. He said, "Before I returned to China, the Kishi Nobusuke government secretly sent someone to give me a letter and 100,000 yen, wanting me to accept it. I asked him what this was all about, and I couldn't accept it without an explanation! That person said, 'This is just a small token, please accept it.' I said, 'No matter what the significance, big or small, I can't accept it without a clear explanation!' Then the person said, 'Why did you accept the money that China entrusted to the Japanese Red Cross to give you, but you won't accept this money? Isn't it all about making friends?' I said, 'That won't do; I can't accept your money with unclear intentions!'" When talking about the Japanese government's despicable attempt to bribe him, a look of anger and disdain frequently appeared on Liu Lianren's face. Zhao Jianmin and Wang Zhuoru praised Liu Lianren's actions, pointing out that the Japanese government should publicly declare compensation for all of Liu Lianren's losses.

Zhao Jianmin inquired with concern about Liu Lianren's health. Liu Lianren also inquired with concern about the changes in his hometown from the governors. Liu Lianren said that he saw that the rural areas of the motherland along the way were much richer and more beautiful than in the past. He said that a large amount of rice was planted in the Tianjin area, and his hometown was also a low-lying area, and wondered if rice could also be planted there. Zhao Jianmin told Liu Lianren about what he saw when he personally went to Liu Lianren's hometown - Gaomi and Zhucheng areas - to inspect the work not long ago. He said, "This year will definitely be a good year. Your hometown is the same as everywhere else: it can drain when there is flooding, and it can irrigate when there is drought; the amount of fertilizer applied per mu is several times more than when you farmed the land at home." Liu Lianren also said, "I remember that before I was abducted, my hometown had not yet been liberated, but when I went out to work, I met the Eighth Route Army. They could fight the Japanese devils and also help the common people harvest wheat. I had long felt that they were the ones who would save us poor people!"

At noon, the governors specially hosted a simple banquet to entertain Liu Lianren and his wife, son, and younger brother.

    山东省长和刘连仁畅谈
    介绍家乡情况并转述全省人民的关怀
    刘连仁再一次表示能够回国主要是祖国强大了
    新华社济南20日电　新华社记者康宁、艾蕴报道：今天上午，山东省省长赵健民、副省长王卓如、刘民生在省长办公室接见了难胞刘连仁。
    刘连仁今天显得特别愉快而自然。省长们对他亲切的慰问和关怀，使他近日来一直保持着的那种激动而又略带拘谨的神态很快就消失了。省长赵健民热情地对他说：“欢迎你已经重归祖国的怀抱，回到了山东，很快就可以回到可爱的家乡了！”也许刘连仁正是觉得自己像是已经回到了家乡，他的话比往常多起来，口齿也变得清楚而流畅。他向省长们尽情地倾诉在日本十四年的苦难，吐露自己的感想和心情，并且关切地探询了家乡的近况。
    刘连仁在叙述他死里逃生的经过以后感慨地说：“莫说是十四年，就是一刹也难熬啊！现在我是熬过来了，可是我比谁都明白，若不是祖国的强大，我非死在那里不可——不是死在山里，也得被他们从山里找出来杀了。这次我被发现，日本政府还存心想害我，他们没有害成当然不是怕我，是怕咱的国家在共产党和毛主席领导下，人多心齐力量大！”
    赵健民省长说：“我们从报纸上得知你的信息以后，都非常关怀你。后来看到日本政府那种无理的态度，全山东人民都非常愤慨！”
    刘连仁立即接着说：“好的就是好，坏的就是坏。日本庄稼人、老百姓和友好团体待我真是好，他们把我找出来以后都去看我，说对不起我。我说以前的事不谈了，大家重新交朋友。我离开日本的时候，日本人民还一再嘱咐我，要我替他们向全中国人民问好！”
    谈到日本政府的态度，刘连仁气愤得脸色都变了。他说：“日本政府无赖地说我是他们花钱雇的，我问他们是怎么雇的我？花多少钱雇的我？”刘连仁又谈到岸信介政府在他回国之前对他施行的一些卑劣无耻的手段。他说：“岸信介政府在我回国前暗地里派了一个人去送给我一封信和十万块钱（日币），要我收下，我问他这是怎么回事，不讲明白我是不能收！那个人说，这是小意思，你收了吧。我说，不管什么大意思小意思，不说清楚我是决不能收！那人又说，为什么中国托日本红十字会转交给你的钱收下了，这个钱你却不收？哪里还不是交朋友？我说那不行，我不能收你们这不明不白的钱！”刘连仁在谈到日本政府这种企图对他进行收买的卑鄙勾当时，脸上不时浮现出一种愤恨鄙夷的神情。赵健民和王卓如赞许刘连仁的这一行动，他们指出，日本政府应该公开声明赔偿刘连仁的一切损失。
    赵健民关怀地询问了刘连仁的健康状况。刘连仁也向省长们关切地探询了自己家乡的变化。刘连仁说，他沿途看到祖国的农村比往昔富饶美丽得多了，他说天津一带大量种植水稻，他自己的家乡也是洼地，是否也能种水稻。赵健民把他不久以前他亲自到刘连仁的家乡——高密、诸城一带去检查工作所看到的情形告诉了刘连仁，他说：“今年肯定是个好年景，你的家乡和别处一样：涝了能放，旱了能浇；每亩地施的肥料比你在家种地时多了好几倍。”刘连仁还说：“我记得我被掳走以前，家乡还没解放，可是我外出干活时遇见过八路军，他们能打鬼子，还帮老百姓割麦子，我早就觉得救俺穷人的非是他们不可！”
    中午，省长们特地设便宴招待刘连仁和他的妻子、儿子、弟弟等。
