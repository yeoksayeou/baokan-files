Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 11th: According to "Labor News," the Soviet Antarctic expedition recently discovered a huge iceberg in the sea area of the Shackleton Glacier. It is 90 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide, which is about the same area as Luxembourg in Europe. This is one of the largest icebergs discovered in the 20th century.

This iceberg was discovered by a Soviet famous polar pilot, Pirov, when he was piloting an "Il-12" aircraft to scout for ice conditions in the Shackleton Glacier area along the Antarctic coast. The iceberg is 40 meters high. Icebergs usually have only one-sixth exposed above the sea surface, so the total thickness of the iceberg, including the underwater part, is estimated to be 240 meters. If this iceberg were completely melted, the amount of water obtained would be equivalent to the total amount of water flowing from the Volga River into the Caspian Sea in thirty-two months. It took the plane about an hour to fly around the iceberg.

    南极发现大冰山面积等于卢森堡
    据新华社莫斯科11日电　据“劳动报”报道，苏联南极考察队前不久在沙克尔敦冰河地区的海面上发现了一座巨大的冰山，长九十公里，宽三十公里，也就是说，差不多等于欧洲的卢森堡的面积。这是二十世纪发现的最大冰山之一。
    这座冰山是苏联著名极地飞行员彼罗夫所驾驶的一架“伊尔十二式”飞机在南极沿岸沙克尔敦冰河地区侦察冰情时发现的。这座冰山高达四十公尺。冰山通常只有六分之一露在海面上，因此，这座冰山水上和水下部分加在一起的总厚度估计有二百四十公尺。如果使这座冰山全部溶化，所获得的水的数量将相当于伏尔加河在三十二个月中流入里海的全部河水的总和。飞机围绕冰山飞一圈就花了一小时左右。
