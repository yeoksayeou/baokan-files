    Tianjin Federation of Philosophy and Social Science Societies
    Revising Plans and Preparing to Launch Activities
    (Our newspaper reports) The Tianjin Federation of Philosophy and Social Science Societies has been established. During the process of preparing for the establishment of the Federation, various societies and relevant departments put forward the focus of research work in various disciplines. In philosophy, it was proposed to strengthen research on the two types of contradictions in socialist society, the issue of contradiction transformation, the characteristics of contradictions among the people and their solutions, as well as the criticism of the worldviews and ideological methods of right-wing elements and the study of the history of philosophy. In economics, the focus should be on the study of the leap forward and restructuring of Tianjin's industry, and, in conjunction with the situation in the Tianjin area, the study of the role of the law of value under the socialist system, and China's price policy during the transition period. In history, it was proposed to systematically criticize bourgeois historical views—firstly, to criticize the struggle between the two lines in the historical circles represented by the reactionary academic thought of the right-wing element Lei Haizong, and, in conjunction with the struggle between historical materialism and the Hu Shi school since the May Fourth Movement, to criticize the old historical views before liberation. In education, the focus should be on organizing the criticism of the reactionary educational ideas of right-wing elements (such as Chen Yousong, Li Jianxun, etc.) and thoroughly criticizing pragmatist (including Dewey, Hu Shi, etc.) educational thought. In linguistics, the focus should be on criticizing the bourgeois linguistic views of right-wing elements such as Chen Mengjia, and conducting a survey and research on dialects in Hebei Province, etc. In literature, the bourgeois literary views and literary theories (including Lu Kanru, Zhong Jingwen, Feng Xuefeng, etc.) in classical and modern literature should be criticized.
    More than fifty people attended the inaugural meeting. They unanimously expressed that, under the leadership of the Party and the government and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, they will certainly be able to overcome the shortcomings of valuing the past over the present, being divorced from reality in the direction of research work, and the dispersed strength, working independently, and the insufficient academic atmosphere in the city in the past. All philosophy and social science workers must work harder to transform themselves, strive to be both red and expert, and serve the great leap forward in production. They will revise their plans and prepare to launch activities. (Ji)

    天津市哲学社会科学学会联合会
    修订规划准备开展活动
    本报讯　天津市哲学社会科学学会联合会已经成立。在筹备成立社联的过程中，各个学会和有关部门提出了各个学科研究工作的重点。哲学方面提出要加强关于社会主义社会两类矛盾、矛盾转化问题，人民内部矛盾的特点及其解决办法的研究，以及对右派分子的世界观及其思想方法的批判和哲学史的研究等。在经济学方面，要着重关于天津工业的跃进与改组问题的研究，和结合天津地区的情况，研究社会主义制度下价值规律的作用，及我国过渡时期的价格政策等问题。在历史学方面，提出要进行系统地批判资产阶级史学观点——首先批判以右派分子雷海宗的反动学术思想为代表的史学界两条道路的斗争，结合“五四”以来历史唯物论与胡适派的斗争，批判解放前旧史学观点。在教育学方面，要着重组织对右派分子（如陈友松、李建勋等）反动教育思想观点的批判和对实用主义（包括杜威、胡适等）教育思想作彻底批判。在语言学方面，着重批判右派分子陈梦家等的资产阶级语言学观点，并进行河北省方言调查研究等。在文学方面，对古典与现代文学中资产阶级文艺观点、文艺理论（包括陆侃如、锺敬文、冯雪峰等）进行批判等。
    参加成立会的有五十多人。他们一致表示，在党和政府的领导和马克思列宁主义的指导下，一定能够克服过去在研究工作方向上厚古薄今、脱离实际和研究工作中力量分散、各自单干、全市学术空气不够活跃的缺点。全体哲学社会科学工作者要更加努力地进行自我改造，力求红透专深，为生产大跃进服务。他们将修订规划，准备开展活动。（济）
