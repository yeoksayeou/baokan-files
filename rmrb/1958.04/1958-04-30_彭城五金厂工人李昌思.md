    Li Changsi, Worker at Pengcheng Hardware Factory

    After unemployed worker Li Changsi joined the Pengcheng Hardware Factory, his heart was set on improving the factory. This factory was started by three people using thirty yuan in relief funds. In the beginning, they didn't have a furnace for smelting iron, so they used broken cooking pots. They didn't have bellows, so they borrowed them from people after they finished cooking. Now the factory has grown to twenty-eight people. Initially, they produced small items such as shoelace tips and shoe nails, selling them on the street themselves. Now they can produce waterwheels. This year they plan to produce over a thousand waterwheels and supply a large number of waterwheel parts to the countryside. However, the factory has little capital and cannot afford to buy a lathe. Li Changsi thought that without a lathe, it would be difficult to complete this year's production task, so he decided to make one himself. He used his spare time to visit hardware production cooperatives, agricultural machinery factories, and woodworking production cooperatives to see what their lathes looked like. Sometimes he would stare for half an hour, forgetting to eat. He couldn't draw, so he memorized the size and structure of each part of the lathe and started working on it when he returned to the factory. Sometimes, he worked all night, and when others came to work early the next morning, they would stand behind him for a long time without him noticing until they called him. People advised him to rest, but he said that he couldn't sleep with the lathe unfinished, as he had it on his mind. When casting the headstock of the eight-foot lathe, it took three attempts because not enough molten iron was prepared. On the night of April 6th, Li Changsi and Wang Zhenyou, a demobilized soldier from the factory, continued with the third casting after failing twice. They had been working for several late nights and were very tired that day. The molten iron burned Wang Zhenyou's shoe upper, but he didn't even notice. They slept for a little over an hour and went back to work early the next morning. (Gu Ping) (Attached picture)

    彭城五金厂工人李昌思
    失业工人李昌思参加彭城五金厂后，一心想把工厂办好。这个厂是由三个人，用三十元救济费办起来的。开始时炼铁没有炉子，就用烧饭的破锅炼铁，没有风箱，等人家烧过饭借用人家的风箱。现在这个厂已发展到二十八个人了，开始他们生产鞋带头、鞋钉等小东西，自己拿上街去卖，现在已能生产水车了。今年他们要生产水车一千多部，还要生产大批的水车零件供应农村。但厂里资金少，想买车床买不起。李昌思想，没有车床，要完成今年的生产任务是有困难的，他决心自己动手制车床。他利用休息时间跑到五金生产社、农具机械厂、木业生产社去看人家的车床是什么样子。有时呆呆地看上半个钟头，饭也忘了吃。他不会画图，就把车床各个部分的大小、结构记在脑子里，跑回厂就动手干。有时，他干了一夜，第二天大早别人来上班了，站在他后面半天，他也毫不觉察，直到别人喊他，他才知道有人进来了。大家劝他去休息，他说机床没造好，肚里有心事，睡也睡不着。在浇制八尺车床的机头时，因为铁水准备少了，浇了三次才浇成。4月6日夜里，李昌思和厂里的复员军人王振有在失败了两次以后，继续浇第三次。他们连着工作了几个深夜，这天都很疲累了，铁水把王振有的鞋帮烧着了，他自己都没发觉。他们睡了一个多钟头，第二天一早又上班了。　（古平）（附图片）
