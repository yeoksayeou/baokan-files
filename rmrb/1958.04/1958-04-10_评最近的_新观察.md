Critique of Recent Issues of "New Observer"
Ma Tieding

Our people have broad minds and wide horizons. They want to know about all kinds of new things, learn knowledge from various fields, and understand the world's north, south, east, and west. A person can "specialize" in a certain industry, but this will not block their broad spirit of seeking knowledge; they can stay in one city for ten years or eight years, but this will only make them want to see the new face of the motherland's socialist construction even more.

It seems that the bi-monthly magazine "New Observer" is published precisely to meet this need of readers. "Talking about everything from ancient to modern, from China to foreign countries," "Loved by men, women, old and young," "Lively and vivid, with both text and pictures," "Beneficial and interesting, changing customs and habits." These sixteen characters can probably explain the general nature of "New Observer": it must be "miscellaneous"; and it must be "miscellaneous" in a good way, "miscellaneous" in a sophisticated way, "miscellaneous" in a beneficial and interesting way.

Has "New Observer" achieved this level? I think this should not be answered by me; the readers know the answer in their hearts. What I want to say is: in this regard, problems have occurred. Last year and the year before, at a crucial historical juncture, "New Observer" went in the wrong direction. It did promote the views of bourgeois rightists, replacing a healthy and lively style with bourgeois tastes.

However, "New Observer" corrected its mistakes immediately and is getting better and better. Since the fourth issue of this year, there has been considerable progress in content, writing style, and form. And the seventh issue, published on April 1st, is, in my opinion, the best issue of last year and this year, a leap forward (it was precisely after reading this issue that I was interested in writing this short article).

I say that this issue is a leap forward, not only because it has good articles; to be honest, even when "New Observer" made mistakes, each issue had good articles. I say it is good because, as mentioned above, it is "miscellaneous in a sophisticated way, miscellaneous in an interesting and beneficial way."

As a reader, my personal ideal of "New Observer" is this: first, each issue (or almost each issue) should have one (or several) "current affairs commentary" like Guo Lao's "Answering Our Magazine's Reporter's Question on Writing Style." This does not mean, of course, requiring every article to be as important and as good as Guo Lao's, but rather that "New Observer" should have commentary and a voice on the pressing issues in real life (mainly issues of ideology and style). Second, each issue (or every one or two issues) should have one (or several) articles from advanced areas, written by advanced figures, like the one written by Comrade Cheng Peng, the First Secretary of the Hongan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, "Hongan in Leap Forward." As an aside: Comrade Cheng Peng's article is written very simply and powerfully, with a heroic momentum; it is a good article. Third, each issue should have a moving reportage (or feature) like "Conquering the Kunlun Mountains." This article is indeed a colorful painting, highlighting the construction scene of the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway. As an aside: the column "From the Forefront of National Construction" is quite wonderful. Every time I get "New Observer," I read it first with eagerness. In this column, we can hear the songs of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway workers in the Tengger Desert in Northwest China; we can see the labor of treasure hunters in the deep mountains of Yunnan in Southwest China; we can see the newly installed electric lights beside Xingkai Lake, which spans China and the Soviet Union, in Northeast China; we can learn about the new salt field that will be built in Yinggehai, Hainan Island, in Southeast China. Fourth, each issue should have one (or several) science popularization articles. Fifth, appropriately publish some eye-catching translations like "The Secret of the 'Kashmir Princess' Incident." Sixth, more essays can be published. While specific problems should be discussed, "problem essays" that oppose the "five airs," hit the nail on the head, and promote socialist ideas should especially be encouraged, in order to play a role in changing customs and habits. Seventh, the articles published should, as much as possible, have a "New Observer" style, that is, they should generally be shorter, more lively and fresh, more interesting, and have illustrations whenever possible. ...

In short, we hope that "New Observer" can better and better combine seriousness and liveliness, combine benefit and interest, and unify "miscellaneousness" and sophistication. If "New Observer" has not yet reached a perfect state today, then sooner or later, it will. Because, as far as I know, the editorial department's capabilities are not bad, and the authors and readers it contacts are quite extensive. This magazine is already one with a foundation and has accumulated considerable experience. As long as it continues to be run well, I think that one day, the hundreds of millions of readers with reading ability in the country will read "New Observer."

    评最近的“新观察”
    马铁丁
    我们的人民胸襟开阔，视野广大，要知道各种各样的新事物，要学习多方面的知识，要了解世界的南北东西。一个人，可以“专”于某一行业，但这并不会阻塞他的广泛的求知精神；可以十年八载不离开一城一地，但这只会使他更想看一看祖国社会主义建设的新面貌。
    看来，半月出一期的杂志“新观察”正是为了满足读者的这种需要而办的。“古今中外，无所不谈”，“男女老少，人人爱看”，“生动活泼，图文并茂”，“有益有趣，移风易俗”。这四言八句，大概可以说明“新观察”的一般：既要“杂”；又要“杂”得好，“杂”得精当，“杂”得有益有趣。
    “新观察”是否办到这样的地步了呢？我想，这是不应当由我回答的，读者心中有底。我要说的是：在这方面，不是没有出过问题的。去年和前年在一个重要历史关头上，“新观察”曾经走错了方向，它的确宣扬了资产阶级右派的观点，以资产阶级的趣味代替了健康的生动活泼的作风。
    但是，“新观察”立竿见影地改正了错误，并且越办越好了。从今年的第四期以后，在内容、文风和形式方面，都有不小的长进。而4月1日出版的第七期，我以为是去年和今年最好的一期，是一个跃进（就是因为看了这一期，才引起我写这篇短文的兴趣）。
    我说，这一期是个跃进，并不止是因为有好文章；凭心而论，就在“新观察”犯错误的时候，每期也都是有好文章的。我说好，是因为如上面所说，它“杂得精当，杂得有趣有益”。
    作为一个读者，我个人理想中的“新观察”是这样：第一，每期（或者差不多是每期）都应当有一篇（或几篇）像郭老“关于文风问题答本刊记者问”那样的“时论”。这意思，当然不是要求篇篇都像郭老这一篇那么重要、那么好，而是说，“新观察”对于现实生活中的迫切问题（主要是思想作风方面的问题），应当有评论，有声音。第二，每期（或者隔一两期）应当有一篇（或几篇）像中共红安县委第一书记程鹏同志所写的“跃进中的红安”那样，来自先进地区、出自先进人物之手的文章。附带说一声：程鹏同志这篇文章，写得很单纯而有力量，有一股豪迈的气势，是篇好文章。第三，每期都应当有像“征服昆仑山”那样动人的通讯
  （或叫特写）。这篇文章确是一篇有色彩的绘图，把新藏公路的建设场景给突出地刻画出来了。附带说一声：“来自祖国建设前线”这一栏，是相当精彩的，我每次拿到“新观察”，都以先睹为快。在这一栏里，我们可以听见在祖国西北腾格里沙漠上的包兰铁路工人的歌声；可以看到在祖国西南云山深处的探宝人的劳动；可以望见在祖国东北横跨中苏两国的兴凯湖畔新装起来的电灯；可以知道在祖国东南的海南岛莺歌海上将建设起来的新盐场。第四，每期有一篇（或几篇）科学小品。第五，适当登一些像“‘克什米尔公主号’的秘密”这样令人注目的译文。第六，小品文可以多登一些，具体问题固然要谈，反对五气，切中时弊，宣扬社会主义思想的“问题小品”，尤其应该提倡，以起移风易俗的作用。第七，刊载文章要尽可能有“新观察”式的风格，就是说，一般都短些，活泼清新些，有趣些，能插图就插图。……
    总而言之，我们希望“新观察”能够越来越好地把严肃和活泼结合起来，把有益和有趣结合起来，把“杂”和精统一起来。如果说，“新观察”今天还没有做到完满的地步，那么，早晚有一天，是会做到的。因为，据我所知，编辑部的能力并不差，所联系的作者和读者也相当广泛，这个杂志已经是一个有基础、积累了相当经验的杂志了。只要好好办下去，我想，终有一天，全国有阅读能力的亿万读者，都会看看“新观察”的。
