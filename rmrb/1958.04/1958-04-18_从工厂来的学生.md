The twenty-eight leading cadres from factories in the Nanjing Institute of Technology Night University's Mechanical Class for Veteran Cadres, after one to one and a half years of spare-time study, have completed the main courses of senior and junior high school. This semester they have begun to study the basic university technical course "Mechanical Drawing". They began studying the basic university course Advanced Mathematics in the previous semester.

This veteran cadre special class was established in the summer of 1956, with classes three or four evenings a week for approximately nine hours. The twenty-eight students include factory directors, section chiefs, workshop directors, etc. Their original educational level was mostly equivalent to junior high school, with a few having only elementary school diplomas. Tang Yingluo, a deputy factory director, insisted on attending evening classes and self-study, and never forgot to study even when on business trips. Every semester, he maintained a score of five in all his subjects. Wu Zhiyu, the director of the metalworking workshop at the state-owned Nanjing Hydraulic Instrument Factory, was originally an old worker with a low level of education. He not only insisted on self-study every night, but also used all his Sundays to review his lessons.

    从工厂来的学生
    南京工学院夜大学机械类老干部特别班里的从工厂来的二十八个负责干部，经过一年到一年半的业余学习，学完了高、初中主要课程，这学期开始学习大学基础技术课“机械制图”，他们在上学期已开始学习大学基础课高等数学。
    这个老干部特别班是1956年暑假成立的，每周上课三、四个晚上约九小时。二十八个学员包括工厂厂长、科长、车间主任等，他们原来的文化水平多数相当于初中程度，个别的只有小学毕业。一个工厂副厂长唐英洛坚持晚上上课和自习，出差也不忘学习，每学期他的各门功课都保持五分的成绩。国营南京水工仪器厂金工车间主任吴智宇原来是个老工人，文化水平低，他不仅每晚坚持自习，所有星期天也利用来温习功课。
