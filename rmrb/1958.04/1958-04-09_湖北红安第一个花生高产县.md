Agricultural High Yield Ambitions

    Hong'an, Hubei, First High-Yield Peanut County
    Under the threat of an 80-day autumn drought last year, Hong'an County in Hubei Province harvested an average yield of 600 jin per mu on more than 47,000 mu of peanut fields. While achieving large-scale bumper harvests, many agricultural cooperatives here also created high-yield records of 1,128 jin to 1,280 jin per mu on different areas. According to statistics, last year 128 cooperatives in the county had an average peanut yield of over 800 jin per mu, and more than 3,000 mu of peanut fields in the county reached 1,000 jin.
    The experience of Hong'an County in increasing peanut production can be summarized as follows: the Party committee and agricultural cooperatives have dedicated personnel to lead this production; superior seeds are generally carefully selected; various fertilizers are applied in stages according to the needs of the crops; appropriate close planting is carried out according to the soil fertility; and weeding, soil cultivation, and mound building are meticulously done.

    湖北红安第一个花生高产县
    湖北红安县在去年秋旱八十天的威胁下，四万七千多亩花生田获得平均每亩六百斤的高额产量。在出现大面积丰产的同时，这里许多农业社还在不同的面积上，创造了一千一百二十八斤到一千二百八十斤的高产纪录。据统计，去年全县有一百二十八个社平均亩产花生八百斤以上，全县有三千多亩花生田达到千斤。
    红安县花生增产的经验，概括起来有这样几项：党委和农业社有专人领导这项生产；普遍精选良种；根据作物的需要，分期施足各种肥料；根据地力适当密植；精细锄草，培土壅蔸。
