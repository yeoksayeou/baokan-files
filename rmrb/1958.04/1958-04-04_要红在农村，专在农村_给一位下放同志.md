To Be Red in the Countryside, Specialize in the Countryside
—To a Comrade Sent Down
Shen Jiyun

I was both happy and concerned upon receiving your letter. I was happy that you have come into contact with reality, have begun to understand some of the difficulties in creating the revolutionary cause, and have admitted that you were indeed not red enough in the past, and therefore stated "I will never be intimidated by difficulties, and I will never return until I have been tempered into a strong person!" This is indeed much stronger than you were before.

But I am still very concerned. Your understanding of "tempering" is still very incomplete, and your heart has not truly been placed in the countryside. You said, "I have decided to settle down in the countryside to be tempered into being red, and then return to the office to seek specialization." Therefore, you just "bury yourself in labor, not fearing hand pain or backaches, but unwilling to be disturbed by others, for fear of affecting your labor tempering."

I think the crux of the problem lies here. The "others" you mentioned are none other than the peasant masses and grassroots cadres; the "disturbance" you mentioned is none other than they want to ask you, a person with culture, to help them with something. How can you regard the masses and grassroots cadres as "others," and how can you regard their requests as "disturbances" to yourself?

This is still because you have not abandoned your original views. In your opinion, labor tempering can promote redness, but it is a hindrance to specialization. In your mind, it seems that redness and specialization really cannot be obtained at the same time. Therefore, you are eager to seek "redness" (in your opinion, as long as you can withstand the test of labor, you are considered red), and are eager to return to the office after completing the labor tempering task. You are unwilling to care about anything else. This naturally creates contradictions again, and the essence of this contradiction is still the contradiction between the individual and the collective.

You have understood "labor tempering" too narrowly. You only want to obtain some conditions that are beneficial to your personal development (for example, a certain qualification), and not, as the Party requires, temper yourself into a cadre who can truly shoulder the task of building the cause of communism. Therefore, your motivation still belongs to the nature of individual struggle. If you do not overcome this, I think it will be difficult for you to complete the task of tempering. It is needless to say that you will not be able to specialize, and you will not even be able to become red.

For example, take redness. This requires socialist consciousness. A very important point is to abandon individualism and be determined to serve the cause of socialist construction and the people. Currently, a technical and cultural revolution is being carried out in the countryside. This revolution is related to the success or failure of socialist construction in the countryside, and also to the cultural emancipation and complete liberation of the peasants. They ask you to participate and use your existing culture to help them. But you regard such an important revolutionary movement as a "disturbance." Isn't this going against "redness"?

Therefore, I advocate that you completely entrust your heart to the peasants. You must actively participate in this great revolution with the peasants. You will be able to comprehensively temper yourself and gain practical experience in how to serve the masses from this mass revolutionary activity. The cultural revolution and technical revolution of the peasants cannot be separated from production practice. If you are separated from production, the peasants will not be able to carry out the cultural revolution and technical revolution. Therefore, your participation in this cultural revolution is not in conflict with labor tempering, but is an inevitable combination. This is the unity of specialization and redness.

I hope that you will be red in the countryside and also specialize in the countryside. The first thing to do is to put your heart in the countryside and hand it over to the Party and the peasants. "Being in the countryside with your heart in the city" will not do things well.

    要红在农村，专在农村
    ——给一位下放同志

    接到你的来信，又高兴又耽心。高兴的是你接触了实际，已经开始理解到一些缔造革命事业中的艰难，承认了自己过去的确不红，因而表示“决不被困难吓倒，不锻炼成一个坚强的人决不回去！”这比以前的你，确实坚强多了。
    但我仍然很耽心。你对“锻炼”的理解还是很不全面，你的心还没有真正放在农村。你说“我决定先安心在农村锻炼成红的，再回到机关里去求专”。因而只是“埋头劳动，手再疼，腰再酸也不怕，就是不愿别人来打搅自己，生怕影响了自己的劳动锻炼。”
    我看问题的症结就在这里。你说的“别人”，无非就是农民群众和基层干部；你说的“打搅”，无非就是他们想求你这有文化的人帮助作些什么。怎能把群众和基层干部看作“别人”，而对于他们的要求，又怎能看作是对自己的“打搅”呢？
    这还是由于你没有放弃你原来的看法。在你看来，劳动锻炼虽能促进红，但对于专却是一种妨害。在你身上，好像红和专真的就是无法同时求得似的。所以，你就求“红”（在你看来，只要受得起劳动考验就算是红了）心切，急于在完成劳动锻炼任务后，回到机关里来。对于其他一切方面都是不愿再去管的。这自然就又产生了矛盾，而这种矛盾的实质仍还是个人同集体的矛盾。
    你把“劳动锻炼”理解得太狭窄了，你只是想求得一些有利于个人发展的条件（例如，某一种资格），而并非像党所要求的那样，把自己锻炼成一个真正能够担当起建设共产主义事业的干部。因而你的动机，仍属于个人奋斗的性质，如不克服这一点，我看你就很难完成锻炼的任务，专不了是不用说了，而且也红不了。
    比如拿红来说吧，这是要有社会主义的觉悟。其中非常重要的一点，就是要放弃个人主义，决心为社会主义建设事业和为人民群众服务。当前农村里正在开展一个技术和文化的革命运动。这个革命既关系着农村社会主义建设的成败，又关系着农民的文化翻身和彻底解放。他们要求你参加，用你现有的一点文化来帮助他们。而你，对这样一个重要的革命运动，却看做是一种“打搅”，这岂不正是同“红”背道而驰吗？
    因此我主张你把心彻底交给农民。要积极同农民一道参加这场大革命。你会从这场群众的革命活动中，使自己得到全面的锻炼，也取得怎样为群众服务的实际经验。农民的文化革命和技术革命，是离不开生产实践的，离开了生产，农民就闹不起文化革命和技术革命来。因此，你参加这种文化革命，也不能脱离生产劳动，你要像现在一样对生产技术一无所知，你根本就在这个革命中插不上手。因此参加农村的文化革命，同劳动锻炼并不矛盾，而是必然的结合。这是专和红的统一。
    望你红在农村，也专在农村，这首先就得先把心放在农村，交在党和农民的手里。“身在农村心在城”是办不好事的。
