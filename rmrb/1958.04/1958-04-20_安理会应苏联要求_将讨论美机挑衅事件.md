Xinhua News Agency, April 19th, New York Dispatch: It was announced on the evening of the 18th that the United Nations Security Council decided to meet on April 21st to discuss the issue of American bombers carrying atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs flying towards the Soviet border through the Arctic region, thereby posing a serious threat to peace.

The Security Council decided to convene the meeting at the request of the Soviet Union. Soviet Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, wrote a letter to the President of the Security Council for April, American Representative Lodge, on the 18th, requesting the Security Council to take emergency measures to stop such flights by American military aircraft.

The US State Department issued a statement on the same day, attempting to deny that US military aircraft were conducting provocative flights in the Arctic region or near the Soviet border. However, according to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on this day, some officials in the US Department of Defense did not deny that American aircraft capable of carrying hydrogen bombs were making "regular patrols towards potential enemy targets."

Xinhua News Agency, April 19th, TASS, New York, April 18th: Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, delivered a letter to the President of the United Nations Security Council, Lodge, on the 18th. The letter stated: "I am entrusted by the Soviet government to request you to promptly convene a meeting of the Security Council to discuss the 'issue of taking emergency measures to stop American aircraft carrying atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs from flying towards the Soviet border.'"

"The reason why the Security Council needs to immediately discuss this issue is that the danger posed by the multiple flights of American bombers carrying hydrogen bombs towards the Soviet border threatens the cause of peace. It is well known that according to the provisions of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and the security of all peoples. Therefore, the Soviet government hopes that the Security Council will immediately discuss the above-mentioned issue and take necessary measures to eliminate the threat to the cause of peace."

    安理会应苏联要求
    将讨论美机挑衅事件
    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：据18日晚间宣布，联合国安全理事会决定4月21日开会，讨论载有原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机通过北极地区向苏联边境飞行，从而对和平造成严重威胁的问题。
    安理会是应苏联的要求决定召开会议的。苏联驻联合国代表索波列夫18日写信给安理会4月份主席美国代表洛奇，要求安理会采取紧急措施，制止美国军用飞机的这种飞行。
    美国国务院在同一天发表声明，力图抵赖美国军用飞机在北极地区或者苏联边境附近作挑衅性飞行。但是，据路透社这一天从华盛顿发出的一条消息说，美国国防部某些官员并不否认能够载氢弹的美国飞机向着“潜在的敌人目标作定期巡逻”。
    新华社19日讯　塔斯社纽约18日讯：苏联常驻联合国代表索波列夫18日交给联合国安全理事会主席洛奇一封信。信中说：“我受苏联政府的委托，请求您迅速召开安全理事会会议，来讨论‘关于采取紧急措施以制止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机向苏联边境飞行的问题’”。
    “安全理事会所以有必要立即讨论这一问题，是因为载有氢弹的美国轰炸机多次向苏联国境飞行所产生的危险使和平事业遭到了威胁。大家都知道根据联合国宪章的规定，安全理事会对维护国际和平和各国人民的安全负有主要责任。因此，苏联政府希望安全理事会立即来讨论上述问题，并且采取必要措施来消除对和平事业的威胁。”
