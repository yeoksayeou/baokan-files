Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 8th: The "Indonesia Torch" newspaper reported today that government troops advancing westward from Pekanbaru have liberated Pulau Gadang after recovering Bangkinang.

The newspaper expects that Payakumbuh, an important city 70 kilometers from Bukittinggi, will soon be liberated. Pulau Gadang is a crucial transportation hub connecting Bangkinang, Payakumbuh, and Bukittinggi.

It is reported that the highway between Bukittinggi and Payakumbuh is already under the control of people's guerrillas and troops led by Nur Mattias, commander of the 140th Battalion, who defected from the Hussein Group.

According to Antara News Agency's Central Sumatra dispatch on the 7th, as government troops are advancing on Padang and Bukittinggi from the east and south, the Central Sumatra rebels are frantically building a defense line in the Singkarak Lake area north of Solok. This was personally led by Jambek, a rebel leader, after the government troops recovered Lubuk Jambi on the 4th.

The dispatch said that the Hussein Group is now practically isolated from the eastern and southern regions.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 7th: A Xinhua reporter's summary of the recent military situation in Indonesia states: After recovering the entire Riau region in eastern Central Sumatra, Indonesian government troops are resolutely and victoriously advancing westward, attacking the Bukittinggi-Padang-Solok area, which has been seized by the Hussein Group, from two directions.

One route of government troops advancing westward from Pekanbaru recovered Bangkinang on March 28th, the location of the rebel "government," more than 100 kilometers northeast of Bukittinggi. The recovery of Bangkinang indicates that the government troops have successfully crossed the main peak of the Bukit Barisan Mountains, pointing the spearhead of the offensive at Payakumbuh, an important stronghold on the outskirts of Bukittinggi.

Another route of government troops recovered Lenggok, Taluk, Lubuk Jambi, and other locations and is conducting mopping-up operations. Lubuk Jambi is about 10 kilometers from Sungai Rumbai, an important highway hub in southern West Sumatra. Therefore, the government troops are now in a position to cut off the Hussein rebel group's escape route to Jambi and South Sumatra at any time. This route of government troops will encircle the rebels in Padang. Lubuk Jambi is about 100 kilometers from Padang.

Both routes of government troops have now crossed the plains and swamps of eastern Central Sumatra and will clear the rebels in the mountainous areas of West Sumatra. It is generally believed that government troops may encounter stronger resistance in the outer areas of Padang and Bukittinggi.

However, the morale of the rebel group's troops is low, and they are opposed by the people. It is reported that two-fifths of the more than 20 companies of troops controlled by Hussein are young students who joined the rebels either under duress or through deception. Therefore, even though Hussein's troops are equipped with American weapons, these troops, with their low morale and lack of training, are bound to be defeated when they encounter government troops.

It is reported that many veterans in the rebel army are also dissatisfied with Hussein and Sjafruddin's rebellion. Nur Mattias, the commander of the 140th Battalion under Hussein's control, has led hundreds of soldiers out of Bukittinggi into the jungle. Recently, in Solok and other places in West Sumatra, another 300 "student soldiers" of the rebel group fled to the countryside.

The morale of the government troops is very high, and the army, navy, and air force have also cooperated effectively in combat.

Most of the Naimgolang rebel troops who fled after the failed mutiny in Medan have been wiped out. Many of Naimgolang's rebel troops who fled north to Aceh have surrendered to local government troops. Government army and air force are tracking down and pursuing Naimgolang's rebel troops who fled to Tarutung, many of whom either surrendered in Lake Toba or were eliminated there. News has it that only a small number of rebels fled to Tarutung, and the Army Chief of Staff has ordered the local military authorities to disarm this rebel force. However, according to Lieutenant Colonel Hassan Kasim, Chief of Staff of the First Military Region, the garrison in Tarutung feels that its strength is still insufficient. News has it that some government troops are stationed in Siligarang, Tarutung, thus thwarting the rebels' plot to use this place as a base for attacking North Sumatra.

In the rebel-controlled areas of northern and central Sulawesi, soldiers and local people have staged numerous armed uprisings. Troops and people loyal to the central government liberated Palu and the important seaport of Langara in Central Sulawesi at the end of March. Most of Central Sulawesi has now been liberated. The government air force began using Palu airport on April 1st, which directly threatens the Sumual-Sombah rebel group's lair, Manado.

Although the strength of the rebel group is weakening day by day, the activities of American imperialism and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in supporting the rebels deserve serious attention. According to Indonesian newspapers, the imperialists are trying to strengthen the Sumual-Sombah rebel forces, attempting to use North Sulawesi as the last base for the rebels when Hussein is unable to gain a foothold in West Sumatra. Newspaper reports reveal that the rebels in North Sulawesi have recently imported more weapons from British Borneo and other places. Sumitro, the "Minister of Trade" of the Padang rebel group, recently also went to North Sulawesi to negotiate the purchase of Chiang Kai-shek's group's aircraft from the Philippines.

### 中苏门答腊叛军慌乱涣散  政府军士气高昂两路挺进  苏拉威西叛乱地区军民纷纷起义

    中苏门答腊叛军慌乱涣散
    政府军士气高昂两路挺进
    苏拉威西叛乱地区军民纷纷起义
    新华社雅加达8日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天报道，从北干巴鲁向西挺进的政府军继收复班基南之后，又解放了浮罗加东。
    这家报纸预料，离武吉丁宜七十公里的重要城市巴雅公务不久就要解放。浮罗加东是连接班基南、巴雅公务和武吉丁宜的公路交通枢纽。
    据报道，武吉丁宜和巴雅公务之间的公路已经在人民游击队和脱离侯赛尼集团的第一四○营营长努尔·马提亚斯率领的军队的控制之下。
    据安塔拉通讯社7日的中苏门答腊消息说，在政府军正在从东面和南面向巴东和武吉丁宜进军的时候，中苏门答腊叛军正在慌忙地在梭洛以北的森卡腊湖地区建筑一条防线。这件事是在政府军在4日收复鲁务占碑以后，由叛军的一个头子贾姆贝克亲自领导进行的。
    消息说，侯赛尼集团目前实际上处于同东面和南面的地区隔绝的孤立状态。
    新华社雅加达7日电　新华社记者综述印度尼西亚最近的军事形势说：在收复了中苏门答腊东部的整个廖内地区以后，印度尼西亚政府军正在坚决、胜利地向西推进，并且从两路进攻侯赛尼集团窃据的武吉丁宜—巴东—梭洛地区。
    从北干巴鲁向西挺进的一路政府军在3月28日收复了叛乱“政府”所在地武吉丁宜东北一百多公里的班基南。班基南的收复表明政府军已经胜利地越过了武吉巴里散群山的主峰，把进攻的矛头指向巴雅公务——武吉丁宜外围的重要据点。
    另一路政府军收复了冷岳、塔卢克、鲁务占碑和其他地点，并且正在进行扫荡战斗。鲁务占碑离西苏门答腊南部的重要公路枢纽双溪冷沙约十公里。因此，政府军已经有可能随时切断侯赛尼叛乱集团逃往占碑和南苏门答腊的道路。这一路政府军将包围巴东的叛乱分子。鲁务占碑距巴东约一百公里。
    两路政府军目前已经越过中苏门答腊东部的平原和沼泽地带，并且将清除西苏门答腊山区的叛军。一般人认为，政府军在巴东和武吉丁宜的外围地区可能遭到较强烈的抵抗。
    但是，叛乱集团的军队士气低落，并且遭到人民的反对。据报道，侯赛尼控制的二十多个连的军队中有五分之二是青年学生，他们参加叛军不是由于受到威胁就是由于受了欺骗。因此，仅管侯赛尼的军队配备了美国武器，这些士气低落和缺乏训练的军队一遇到政府军，也就不免要遭到溃败。
    据报道，叛军中的许多老兵对侯赛尼和沙弗鲁丁的叛乱活动也不满意。侯赛尼控制下的第一四○营营长努尔·马提亚斯已经从武吉丁宜率领几百名士兵逃进丛林。最近在梭洛和西苏门答腊的其他一些地方，还有叛乱集团的三百名“学生军”逃往乡下。
    政府军队的士气则非常高昂，在作战中陆军、海军和空军也进行了有效的合作。
    在棉兰发动叛变失败后逃跑的奈恩戈兰叛军，已经有大半被肃清。奈恩戈兰的一股向北逃往亚齐的叛军有许多已经向当地的政府军投降；政府陆军和空军正在跟踪追击逃往打板奴里的奈恩戈兰的叛军，其中有许多人不是在多巴湖投降，就是在那里被消灭了。有消息说，只有一小部分叛军逃窜到打板奴里，陆军参谋长已经命令当地军事当局解除这股叛军的武装。但是据第一军区参谋长哈桑·卡西姆中校说，打板奴里驻军感到力量还不足。有消息说，有一部分政府军队驻在打板奴里的诗里加郎，因而粉碎了叛军想利用这个地方作为进攻北苏门答腊的基地的阴谋。
    在苏拉威西的北部和中部叛军控制的地区，士兵和当地人民举行了多次的武装起义。忠于中央政府的军队和人民在3月底解放了巴路和中苏拉威西的重要海港浪加拉。中苏拉威西的大部分地区现在已经解放了。政府空军从4月1日起开始利用巴路机场，这样就直接威胁着苏穆阿尔—宋巴叛乱集团的巢穴万鸦老。
    虽然叛乱集团的力量一天天在削弱，但是美帝国主义和东南亚条约组织支持叛乱分子的活动值得严重注意。据印度尼西亚报纸报道，帝国主义者正在设法加强苏穆阿尔—宋巴叛军的力量，企图在侯赛尼无法在西苏门答腊立足的时候，把北苏拉威西作为叛乱分子的最后基地。报纸消息揭露，北苏拉威西的叛军最近从英属婆罗洲和其他地方运入了更多的武器。巴东叛乱集团的“贸易部长”苏米特罗最近也到北苏拉威西来商洽从菲律宾购买蒋介石集团飞机的事情。
