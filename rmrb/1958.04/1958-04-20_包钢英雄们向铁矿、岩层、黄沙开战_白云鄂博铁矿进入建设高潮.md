Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, April 19th: The Baiyun Ebo Iron Mine, the ore supply base of Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, has entered a construction climax.

    Currently, centered on the industrial site, within a radius of more than ten square kilometers, builders are clustered on and off the mountains, waging war against iron ore, rock strata, and yellow sand. Powerful excavators, bulldozers, and heavy-duty trucks are roaring and racing. The sound of blasting cannons rises and falls day and night. New industrial and civil buildings are emerging one by one from the ground and in the gaps of existing buildings. During the day, each construction site resembles a bustling market shrouded in sandstorms; at night, the lights on the main mine are scattered, resembling a mountain city that never sleeps.

    From now until the first blast furnace of Baotou Steel is put into production before National Day next year, is the stage with the largest construction scale and the most intense construction of the Baiyun Ebo Iron Mine. During this period, a huge primary ore crushing plant and its underground corridor must be fully completed; electric locomotive railways must be built to the top of the main mine; mechanized mining work surfaces must be opened up; various auxiliary workshops, warehouses, miner living facilities, and newly added residential areas covering tens of thousands of square meters, which are responsible for the mine's mechanical repair, must be put into use. This year alone, the earthwork and stonework will amount to more than one million cubic meters, and hundreds of kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines, Morse lines, and various pipelines. Now, these projects have started in full swing. In order to ensure that Baotou Steel's first blast furnace is put into production on time, the workers have proposed working hard for nineteen months to build the iron mine; working hard for nine months to produce 850,000 tons of ore this year. They said: "The Liberation Army showed heroism on Erlang Mountain, and we must make remarkable achievements in Baiyun Ebo."

    This construction climax emerged on the basis of the Double-Anti movement. Li Yifu, the fifty-year-old secretary of the mine's Party committee, now takes the lead in pushing mine carts up the mountain. The managers and Party committee secretaries of the mine engineering company spend nearly half of their time each week directly directing construction or working shifts on the construction site. Hundreds of technicians and functional personnel have arrived at the scene. Girls from Beijing, Shanghai, Anshan and other places have also walked out of the office, braving sandstorms to carry ore and dig soil on the mountain, and washing work clothes for the workers on Sundays. Creative and problem-solving examples among workers are emerging one after another. The primary crushing plant, a key project of the mine, needs to dig a large foundation pit, and the progress is very slow according to the original blasting method. Wang Jiasheng, an old blasting worker from Dagushan, Anshan, and Wang Defu, the blasting team leader, proposed using the borehole blasting method of drilling deep wells and using large artillery instead. The test results showed that eight cannons collapsed more than 10,000 cubic meters of earth and stone, the work efficiency was increased by more than 100 times, the explosives were saved by nearly half, and the nearby buildings were not affected at all. In this way, the progress of digging the foundation pit was greatly accelerated. On the top of the main mine, mining workers and transferred cadres insisted on mining in the strong wind and sand. The mining figures have been increasing month by month: with the same manpower and equipment, more than 18,000 tons of ore were mined in January, more than 23,000 tons in February, more than 40,000 tons in March, and more than 50,000 tons are planned for April. The workers guarantee to produce 60,000 tons. The workers in the mechanical workshop and the power workshop, which serve the mining, went to the mountains to repair and transform the mine cars, pave the rails, make tools, and repair the wind pipe circuits. The automobile ore transportation team implemented three shifts day and night, with the car not resting. These have created conditions for mining workers to improve work efficiency.

    包钢英雄们向铁矿、岩层、黄沙开战
    白云鄂博铁矿进入建设高潮
    新华社包头19日电　包头钢铁联合企业的矿石供应基地——白云鄂博铁矿山已进入建设高潮。
    目前以工业场地为中心，在方圆十多平方公里之内，山上山下，团团簇簇的建设者们正向铁矿、岩层、黄沙开战。强大的挖土机、推土机、载重汽车在咆哮、奔驰。开山炮声昼夜此起彼落。新的工业和民用建筑，一个一个从平地和原有建筑物的空隙里出现。白天，风沙笼罩中，每个工地像个闹市；晚上，主矿山上电灯错落，像是不夜的山城。
    从现在起，到明年国庆节包钢第一高炉投入生产以前，是白云鄂博铁矿山建设规模最大、施工最紧张的阶段。这期间，一座巨大的矿石初破碎厂和它的地下通廊要全部建成；电气机车铁路要修到主矿山顶；机械化开采的工作面要开辟出来；担任矿山机械修理的各个辅助车间、各种仓库、矿工生活设施和新增住宅区等数万平方公尺的建筑物，都要交付使用。今年内，光是土石方工程就有一百多万立方公尺，高压输电线路、摩电线路、各种管道等几百公里。现在，这些工程已经全面开工。为了保证包钢第一高炉按时投入生产，职工们已经提出苦战十九个月，建成铁矿山；苦战九个月，今年生产矿石八十五万吨。他们说：“解放军在二郎山上逞英雄，我们要在白云鄂博立奇功”。
    这一建设高潮是在双反运动的基础上出现的。五十多岁的矿山党委书记李一夫现在都带头上山推矿车。矿山工程公司的经理和党委书记们，每周有将近一半时间在工地上直接指挥施工或跟班劳动。几百名技术人员、职能人员都到了现场。从北京、上海、鞍山等地来的姑娘们也走出办公室，冒着风沙上山搬矿石、挖土，星期天给工人们洗工作服。工人中的创造和战胜困难的事例更是层出不穷。矿山关键性工程初破碎厂要挖一个大基础坑，按原来爆破法进度很慢。来自鞍山大孤山的老爆破工王家声和爆破组长王德福等，提出用凿深井、放大炮的洞式爆破法来代替。试验结果，八炮崩下土石一万多方，工作效率提高一百多倍，炸药节约将近一半，对附近建筑物毫无影响。这样，就把挖基础坑的进度大大加快。在主矿山顶上，采矿工人和下放干部们在大风沙中坚持采矿。采矿数字月月提高：同样人力和设备，1月份采矿一万八千多吨，2月份二万三千多吨，3月份四万多吨，4月份计划五万多吨，职工们保证出六万吨。为采矿服务的机械车间和动力车间的职工，上山检修和改造了矿车，铺平了轨道，打制了工具，检修了风管电路。汽车运矿队实行昼夜三班倒，歇人不歇车。这些都为采矿工人创造了提高工效的条件。
