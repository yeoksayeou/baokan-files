Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: State Council Directive on Utilizing and Collecting Wild Plant Materials in Our Country

Our country possesses extremely abundant wild plant resources for utilization, with over a thousand important raw materials already discovered. Among these, after testing, there are over four hundred types of wild oil plants suitable for oil extraction; over three hundred types of wild fibers suitable for textile and papermaking; over one hundred types of wild starches and fruits suitable for brewing; and over eighty types of wild chemical raw materials suitable for glue production. In Yunnan, Shanxi, Hebei, and other nine provinces alone, over two hundred types of wild medicinal plants have been discovered. However, only a small portion of these resources is currently being utilized or is under research for utilization, while the vast majority remains scattered across the mountains and fields, neglected by the people. In the current situation of a great leap forward in agricultural production and local industry, it is imperative to fully utilize these wild plant materials as an important supplement to light industrial raw materials. This will not only greatly promote the development of oil, food, textile, papermaking, and pharmaceutical industries and increase export resources but will also have significant implications for the economic prosperity of rural areas, especially mountainous regions. Extracting fibers from abundant wild plants can provide an important solution to the contradiction between grain and cotton land use in our country and the ever-increasing need for fibers in the future. Therefore, all regions should strive to collect and fully utilize those wild plant materials that can already be utilized. For those that cannot yet be utilized, active research and experimentation should be conducted to rapidly enable their utilization. All regions must conduct investigations and research, make comprehensive plans, and adopt a policy of full utilization and active development regarding wild plant materials. The following points are now put forward for consideration and implementation by all regions:

一、Since wild plants grow in a scattered manner and have a highly seasonal ripening period, the collection work is an arduous task. This task must rely on the masses and be undertaken by local agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives should regard this collection work as a major sideline, allocate labor, and arrange production according to the requirements of the purchasing departments. When necessary, various social forces can also be mobilized and organized to carry out timely collection. Relevant departments such as industry, agriculture, forestry, and commerce should provide guidance and assistance in collection techniques.

二、Local processing departments and commercial departments must actively purchase and process the wild plant materials collected by agricultural cooperatives and farmers. For some raw materials that are still in the experimental and research process, they should also be purchased according to plan. However, the purchase plan must be clearly explained to the farmers in advance to avoid harming the farmers' enthusiasm and causing losses to the state. For raw materials and semi-finished products processed locally or transferred out, local agricultural cooperatives can be directly linked with processing factories, or commercial departments can purchase them and supply them to local factories for use or transfer them out. Whether the former or the latter, relevant parties should sign purchase and sale contracts to stabilize and develop production. Wild plants vary in quality, so it is necessary to gradually formulate a simple and easy-to-implement standard and specification for purchase. At the same time, a reasonable purchase price should also be stipulated, so that farmers are willing to collect and factories are willing to use them.

三、All collected and purchased wild plant materials should be processed locally as much as possible using indigenous methods, or processed into semi-finished products locally, to reduce transportation costs and ensure the quality of the raw materials. However, those raw materials with higher value, convenient transportation, or those that cannot be processed locally (such as various wild fibers) can be transferred to factories (workshops) in neighboring areas for processing. All processing enterprises should adopt the principles of adapting to local conditions, making use of simple equipment, comprehensive utilization, and diversified operations. The utilization rate of raw materials, product quality, and production technology must be gradually improved, and production costs must also be gradually reduced. Only by producing high-quality, low-cost, and easily marketable products can the full utilization of these wild plant materials be promoted. Local industry, agriculture, commerce, and forestry departments should pay attention to organizing the exchange of experiences in this regard, strengthen technical guidance, and organize the supply of necessary production equipment.

四、Production using wild plant materials generally requires a trial production and trial sales process. For those wild plant materials that have not yet been utilized, relevant production departments must organize a certain technical force to actively conduct trial production, and sales departments must also vigorously promote and actively conduct trial sales. After trial production and trial sales, clarifying the situation and gaining experience, large-scale production and promotion should be carried out in a planned way.

五、The state should adopt a policy of active support for the utilization of wild plant materials. During the trial production and trial sales period, the state shall exempt these wild raw materials, semi-finished products, and finished products from various taxes and shall not require processing factories and business units to turn over enterprise profits in order to promote the utilization of these resources and the development of production.

六、In order to prevent the phenomenon of certain wild plant materials with greater economic value or wide range of uses becoming increasingly scarce, on the one hand, farmers should be educated to protect their continued growth and reproduction, and not to deplete the resources; on the other hand, under possible conditions, artificial cultivation should be promoted to improve the variety and quality of these raw materials, transforming wild plants into domesticated plants to ensure reproduction and meet needs. In some wild areas, where wild plants grow well and their economic value is higher than reclaiming wasteland for grain cultivation, artificial cultivation of wild plants should be carried out in these areas to make these areas the main base for planting these plants.

七、Relevant scientific and technological research departments should be organized to directly cooperate with various regions to investigate various usable wild plant materials, and to promptly identify the effective components of these raw materials, determine utilization plans, and assist local areas in solving problems occurring in the cultivation and processing of wild plants.

八、At present, light industrial production in our country still feels the lack of sufficient raw material supply, but at the same time, these usable wild plant materials are abandoned and not used. This phenomenon must be resolutely corrected. Relevant business departments have so-called "three fears" about the utilization of these wild plant materials—fear of trouble, fear of stockpiling, and fear of losing money. However, facts have proved that all places and units that rely on the leadership of the Party committee, adopt the mass line method, and achieve close cooperation between supply, production, and sales departments, doing everything possible to actively utilize wild plant materials and expand production, can achieve no trouble, no stockpiling, and no loss of money. It can be seen that these "three fears" are actually inseparable from conservative thinking, departmentalism, and purely business viewpoints. Therefore, it is necessary to open up the minds of cadres, conduct education that combines politics and business, eliminate the "three fears," and clear ideological obstacles for implementing the policy of full utilization and active development.

九、The above-mentioned tasks should be comprehensively planned, unifiedly arranged, and regularly inspected under the leadership of the local Party committee and the People's Committee. Cooperation among relevant departments, especially between supply, production, and sales, must be strengthened to promote each other. Leading organs at all levels, especially leading organs at the county and township levels, must strengthen their leadership over this work and include it as a component of local industrial development and incorporate it into local industrial development plans.

    把野生植物充分利用起来
    国务院指示各地全面规划统一安排定期检查
    新华社9日讯　国务院关于利用和收集我国野生植物原料的指示
    我国可资利用的野生植物原料十分丰富，已发现的重要原料有一千多种。其中经过化验，可供榨油的野生油料，有四百多种；可供纺织、造纸用的野生纤维，有三百多种；可供酿酒用的野生淀粉、水果，有一百多种；可供制烤胶用的野生化工原料，也有八十多种；仅在云南、山西、河北等九省发现的野生植物药材，即有二百多种。可是这些资源，现在只有很少一部分被利用和正在研究利用，而绝大部分还是满山遍野地闲散着，不为人们所重视。在目前农业生产和地方工业大跃进的形势下，必须充分利用这些野生植物原料，作为轻工业原料的重要补充。这样，不仅可以大大地促进油料、食品、纺织、造纸、药材等工业的发展，可以增加出口货源，同时，对于农村特别是山区的经济繁荣，也有重大意义。从大量的野生植物中提取纤维，可以为解决我国粮棉争地的矛盾和今后日益增长的对纤维的需要，提供一项重要的出路。因此，各地对于这些野生植物原料，凡是已经能够利用的，应当尽量收集，充分利用；对于那些还不能够利用的，也应当积极进行研究试验，以便迅速地加以利用。各地对于野生植物原料，必须经过调查研究，进行全面规划，采取充分利用、积极发展的方针。现在提出如下各点，望各地考虑执行。
    一、由于野生植物是分散生长的，成熟期的季节性很大，因此，采集工作是一个繁重的任务。这个任务一定要依靠群众，由当地农业合作社承担起来。农业合作社应当按照收购部门的要求，把这种采集工作，作为主要副业来调配劳动力，安排生产。必要的时候还可以发动和组织各种社会力量，及时地进行采集。工业、农业、林业、商业等有关部门，在采集技术方面，应当给予指导和帮助。
    二、农业合作社和农民采集的野生植物原料，当地加工部门和商业部门一定要积极收购，积极加工利用。对于一些正在试验、研究过程中的原料，也要按计划收购。但是一定要把收购计划事先向农民交代清楚，以免伤害农民的积极性和造成国家损失。对于就地加工或外调的原料和半成品，可以由当地农业合作社同加工工厂直接挂钩；也可以由商业部门收购后，供应当地工厂使用或者外调。不论前者或者后者，为了稳定和发展生产，有关双方应该订立购销合同。野生植物良莠不齐，因此，有必要逐步规定一个简单易行的标准、规格，以便收购。同时，还应当规定一个合理的收购价格，既要使农民乐于采集，又要使工厂乐于使用。
    三、凡是采集和收购的野生植物原料，都应当尽可能地采取土办法就地加工，或者就地加工成半成品，以减少运费和保证原料质量。但是那些价值较高，运输方便或者当地不能加工的原料（如各种野生纤维），可以调到邻近地区的工厂（作坊）加工。一切加工企业，都应当采取因地制宜、因陋就简、综合利用和多种经营的方针。对于原料利用率、产品质量和生产技术，必须逐步提高，生产费用也要逐步降低。只有生产出质量优良、成本低廉、销售顺畅的产品，才能促进这些野生植物原料的充分利用。地方工业、农业、商业、林业部门应当注意组织交流这方面的经验，加强技术指导，组织供应必需的生产设备。
    四、利用野生植物原料进行生产，一般地须要经过一个试产试销的过程。对于那些还没有被利用的野生植物原料，各有关生产部门必须组织一定的技术力量，积极试产；销售部门也要大力宣传，积极试销。经过试产试销，摸清情况，取得经验后，再有计划地大力生产和大力推销。
    五、国家对野生植物原料的利用，应当采取积极扶持的政策。在试产试销期间，对于这些野生原料及其半成品和成品，国家免征各种税收，也不要加工工厂和营业单位上缴企业利润，以便促进这些资源的利用和生产的发展。
    六、为了防止某些经济价值较大或者用途广泛的野生植物原料发生越用越少的现象，一方面应当教育农民，保护它能够继续生长繁殖，不要枯本竭源；另一方面还要在可能条件下，提倡人工培育，改进这些原料的品种质量，变野生为家生，以保证繁殖，适应需要。在某些荒野地区，野生植物生长良好，其经济价值高于开荒改种粮食的情况下，应当在这些地区进行野生植物的人工栽培，使这些地区成为种植这种植物的主要基地。
    七、应当组织有关科学技术研究部门，直接配合各地调查各种可资利用的野生植物原料，并且及时分别鉴定这些原料的有效成分，确定利用方案，协助地方解决野生植物的培育和加工过程中发生的问题。
    八、现在我国的轻工业生产，还感到缺乏足够的原料供应，但是同时又对这些可以利用的野生植物原料弃而不用。这种现象必须坚决纠正。有关业务部门，对这些野生植物原料的利用，有所谓“三怕”——怕麻烦、怕积压、怕赔钱。然而事实证明，凡是依靠党委领导，采取群众路线的方法，在供产销部门之间，做到密切协作，千方百计地积极利用野生植物原料，扩大生产的地方和单位，他们都能做到不麻烦、不积压、不赔钱。由此可见，这“三怕”实际是同保守思想、本位思想和单纯营业观点分不开的。因此，必须打通干部思想，进行政治和业务相结合的教育，破除“三怕”，为贯彻执行充分利用、积极发展的方针扫清思想障碍。
    九、上述各项工作，应当在当地党委和人民委员会领导下，全面规划，统一安排，定期检查。各有关部门之间，特别是供产销之间，必须加强协作，互相促进。各级领导机关，特别是县、乡两级领导机关，必须加强对这一工作的领导，把它作为发展地方工业的一个组成部分，列入地方工业发展规划之内。
