    Behind "Venerating the Ancient, Disparaging the Modern"
    Gan Feng
    The debate between "venerating the ancient, disparaging the modern" and "venerating the modern, disparaging the ancient" is a struggle between two paths in social science. We want social science to serve the current revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, while the masters who insist on "venerating the ancient, disparaging the modern" want to use the dead to serve their individualism.
    A professor from a certain school, when examining why he had a tendency to "venerate the ancient, disparage the modern" in the past, said that he originally had the thought of "liking the ancient and fearing the modern." What did he like? What did he fear?
    First, engaging with the modern is closely linked to the current class struggle, and he feared saying the wrong thing and making political mistakes. It is better to engage with the ancient, to drill into the "ivory tower" of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to enjoy the cool and avoid the heat.
    Second, engaging with the modern, he feared that "there is too much material to master, and it is not easy to make a 'name' for himself." Engaging with the ancient, he was happy that "there is enough historical material to prove his points, but not so much that it cannot be mastered," and he could drill into "niche" subjects to show off his "name" to others.
    Third, engaging with the modern, it is necessary to conduct Marxist analysis on the basis of mastering a large amount of material, and there are living people and living things to testify, fearing there may be errors, which are easily seen by others. Engaging with the ancient, people have been dead for thousands of years, and some questions, you can say whatever you want, and the dead will not rise up to refute you. If you are determined to paint ghosts, others will have to admit that you are an "expert in painting ghosts."
    With these three likes and three fears, it is no wonder that some people sing the "strong tea and plain water theory," regarding the ancient as "strong tea," with endless flavor, and regarding the modern as "plain water," and dismiss it indifferently.
    People with these "three likes and three fears," I think, suffer from three serious diseases: first, detachment from politics and detachment from reality; second, individual fame and fortune thinking; and third, fear of difficulties on the road to science, attempting to take convenient "shortcuts." The root cause of these three "symptoms" is that their foundation is too weak. They boast to us about how knowledgeable they are, but it is actually a lie, or why would they not dare to get involved in doing living scholarship, and like doing dead scholarship so much?
    Born in reality but escaping reality, not studying people but only studying "ghosts," unwilling to serve socialism but wanting the dead to serve their own personal fame and fortune, wanting to conquer the fortress of science but fearing difficulties, this is the thin image of those scholars hiding behind the banner of "venerating the ancient, disparaging the modern."
    Therefore, three doses of medicine are also needed to target their illnesses: first, get out of the ivory tower of "always mentioning the Three Dynasties" and throw themselves into the torrent of the current revolutionary struggle and socialist construction. Second, overcome individual fame and fortune thinking, use their knowledge to serve the current revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, get out of the "niche" in research work, and study issues that are useful to the current revolutionary struggle. Third, arouse revolutionary vigor, and have the determination and perseverance to conquer the most difficult fortresses on the road to science, and then you will slowly move from the narrow path of venerating the ancient and disparaging the modern to the revolutionary road of venerating the modern and disparaging the ancient. However, this also requires the courage to put down the empty frame and admit that one's foundation is weak. I think the professor who made the self-criticism is brave.

    “厚古薄今”的背后
    敢峰
    “厚古薄今”与“厚今薄古”之争，乃是社会科学上两条道路之争，我们要社会科学为当前的革命斗争和社会主义建设服务，而坚持“厚古薄今”的大师们，是要使死人为他们的个人主义服务。
    某校一教授检查他过去为什么有“厚古薄今”的倾向时说，原来他有“喜古畏今”的思想。喜的是什么？怕的是什么？
    其一，搞现代的，与当前的阶级斗争紧密结合，怕说不对犯政治错误。搞古代的则好，钻到三皇五代的“象牙塔”里去乘凉避暑。
    其二，搞现代的，怕“材料太多，掌握不全，驾驭不了”，不容易搞出什么“名堂”来。搞古代的，则喜的是“史料多到能够论证，但又不至于无法掌握”，而且可以钻“冷门”，有“名堂”向人卖弄。
    其三，搞现代的，必须在掌握大量材料的基础上进行马克思主义的分析，又有活人活事作证怕有差错，别人容易看出。搞古代的，人都已经死了几千年，有些问题，你随便怎么讲死人也不会起来反驳。立志要画鬼，别人也只好承认你是“画鬼专家”。
    有此三喜三怕，无怪乎有人高唱“浓茶白水论”，视古为“浓茶”，其味无穷，视今为“白水”，而淡然置之了。
    有此“三喜三怕”的人，我看身上害有三种严重的病，一曰脱离政治、脱离实际，二曰个人名利思想，三曰在科学的道路上害怕困难，企图走简便的“捷径”。三“症”的总病源又是由于他的底子太虚。他们向我们卖弄的如何博学，其实是骗人的，要不他们为什么不敢插手搞活学问，而那样喜欢搞死学问呢？
    生于现实而逃避现实，不研究人而只研究“鬼”，不愿为社会主义服务而要死人为自己的个人名利服务，要攻下科学堡垒又害怕困难，这就是那些躲在“厚古薄今”招牌背后的学者们的枯瘦的画像。
    因此，针对他们的病症也需要三剂药，一是走出“言必称三代”的象牙之塔，投身到当前革命斗争和社会主义建设的洪流中来。二是克服个人名利思想，用自己的知识为当前的革命斗争和社会主义建设服务，走出研究工作中的“冷门”，研究对当前革命斗争有用的问题。三是鼓起革命干劲，要有决心和毅力去攻开科学道路上最困难的堡垒，这样你就会慢慢的由厚古薄今的羊肠小道走上厚今薄古的革命大路上来。然而，这又必须有放下空架子，承认自己底子虚的勇气。那位作了检查的教授，我以为是勇敢的。
