　　Small-scale Oil Refining Equipment Costs Only 75 Yuan
　　A small-scale oil refining equipment designed by the refinery of the Yumen Oilfield has been completed on April 14th.
　　The investment for this small-scale oil refining equipment is only 75 yuan. Its entire equipment consists of: a large circular iron barrel (used horizontally) as the distillation equipment, with a thermometer to control the temperature, a "safety switch" to prevent explosions, and a section of distillation pipe made of galvanized iron sheet. In addition, a cooling water pool is built with bricks and mud, and a cooling pipeline of two to three meters long is made of galvanized iron sheet. When in use, crude oil is placed in the iron barrel, and firewood is burned to heat it from below. Due to the different degrees of heating, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil are fractionated from the iron barrel through distillation and cooling pipelines.

    小型炼油设备只花七十五元
    玉门油矿的炼油厂设计的一种小型石油炼油设备，已在4月14日建成。
    这个小型炼油设备的投资只有七十五元。它的全部设备是：用一个圆形大铁桶（横倒使用）作蒸馏设备，桶上安有一只掌握温度的温度计、一个防止爆炸的“安全开关”和一节用白铁皮做成的蒸馏管线，另外再用砖和泥砌成一个冷却水池，用白铁皮做成两三公尺长的冷却管线。使用时，铁桶内盛原油，燃烧木柴在桶下加热，由于加热的程度不同，汽油、煤油、柴油就从铁桶内经过蒸馏、冷却管线分馏出来。
