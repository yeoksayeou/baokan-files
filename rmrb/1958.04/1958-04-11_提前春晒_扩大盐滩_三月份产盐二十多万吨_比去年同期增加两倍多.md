Early Spring Salt Sunning, Expanded Salt Flats
    March Salt Production Exceeds 200,000 Tons, More Than Tripling Compared to the Same Period Last Year
    (Our report) This March, salt production from salt fields across the country totaled over 200,000 tons, more than three times higher than the same period last year. In the past, the first quarter of each year in several northern coastal salt producing areas was mainly dedicated to production preparation, with very little salt production. However, this year, due to good winter production preparation, salt ponds were repaired early, and the winter brine production plan was overfulfilled. The reserves of high-grade brine in the five salt regions of Liaoning, Tangda, Hangu, Shandong, and Huaibei all exceeded one and a half to two times the amount of the same period last year. Coupled with the earlier arrival of warm weather this year, all salt fields seized the favorable natural conditions, broke with convention, and started salt sunning half a month earlier.
    Many salt workers in the Huaibei Salt Field, following the spirit of diligence and frugality in running enterprises, used their own hands to pave a large number of depressions and barren lands into 64 new salt ponds, which will increase salt production for the country by 14,000 tons. In the Daoxiangcun work area of Jinzhou, Liaoning Province, some workers turned mud flats into blue sand flats to increase production.
    In the Zhejiang salt region, a high tide of water conservancy construction has been generally launched. In the Andong Salt Field alone, this year's water conservancy plan reaches 3.35 million cubic meters of earthwork. Starting from New Year's Day this year, a large seawall more than 40 li long was built within 23 days. This project involved 825,000 cubic meters of earthwork. After completion, it can not only control tides and prevent typhoon disasters, but also reclaim 6,000 mu of salt fields, increasing salt production by more than 10,000 tons. Workers in the Zigong salt area of Sichuan are now completing various leap forward targets month after month.

### 提前春晒　扩大盐滩  三月份产盐二十多万吨  比去年同期增加两倍多

    提前春晒　扩大盐滩
    三月份产盐二十多万吨  比去年同期增加两倍多
    本报讯　今年3月份全国各盐场共产盐二十多万吨，比去年同期增加二倍以上。过去北方几个海盐产区，每年第一季度都是以进行生产准备工作为主，产盐很少。但是今年由于冬季生产准备工作做得好，都提前修了滩，并且都超额完成了冬季制卤计划。辽宁、塘大、汉沽、山东、淮北等五个盐区，存的高级卤都比去年同期超过一倍半到两倍以上。加上今年春暖较早，各盐场都抓住了有利的自然条件，打破常规，提前半个月晒盐。
    淮北盐场的不少盐工，本着勤俭办企业的精神，用自己的双手把大批洼地和荒地，铺成六十四份新滩，这样可为国家增产一万四千吨盐。辽宁省金州稻香村工区，有些工人把泥滩垫成青沙滩，以提高产量。
    在浙江盐区普遍掀起了兴修水利的高潮，仅庵东一个盐场，今年的水利规划就达到三百三十五万土方。从今年元旦开始，二十三天内就修建了一条长达四十多华里的大海堤，这次工程是八十二万五千土方，建成后不但可以控制海潮、防御台风灾害，而且还可开垦六千亩盐田，增产盐一万吨以上。四川自贡盐区的工人们，现在连月完成各项跃进指标。
