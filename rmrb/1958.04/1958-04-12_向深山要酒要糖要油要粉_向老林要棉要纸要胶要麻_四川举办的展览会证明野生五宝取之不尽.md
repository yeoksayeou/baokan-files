Reported by our correspondent Fan Suwei: The Wild Five Treasures Exhibition—fibers, oil plants, starches, fruits, and chemical raw materials—held in Chengdu, has been warmly welcomed by people from both inside and outside the province. This exhibition was jointly organized by the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Chengdu Third Commercial Bureau. Since its opening on March 16, an average of more than 4,000 people have visited it daily. Many representatives from industries, supply and marketing cooperatives, and handicrafts from various places are here to learn how to fully utilize wild plants that were previously discarded in the mountains and fields to solve the needs of the people for food, clothing, and use.

The exhibition is divided into five parts, introducing more than 360 kinds of wild plants that can be utilized throughout the province through pictures and objects. According to preliminary estimates, the annual output of these inexhaustible wild resources reaches 37.95 million dan (approximately 1,897,500 metric tons) for the entire province, which not only provides sufficient raw materials for the development of local industries but also increases the income of farmers in the province by 150 million yuan each year.

The first part of the exhibition is the wild oil plants exhibition room. More than 130 kinds of wild oil plants are exhibited here, with an oil yield of more than 15%, which can be used for edible purposes, lighting, soap making, paint, and general industrial lubricants. Among them, the Machilus nanmu seeds produced in Dazhou, Mianyang, Wenjiang and other regions have an oil content of 52%, which is the wild oil plant with the highest oil yield. A kind of pine nut that grows widely in Sichuan is exhibited here, with an estimated output of more than 10 million jin (5,000 metric tons), which can produce 2.5 million jin (1,250 metric tons) of oil. The Litsea cubeba oil, which is deeply loved by the masses, has a rich fragrance that lingers in the exhibition room. This Litsea cubeba oil has now become an export commodity. Some common oil sources that are not usually noticed, such as morning glory seeds, bodhi tree seeds, and radish seeds, have been discovered for new uses through this exhibition.

What surprised the visitors the most was the wild fiber exhibition room. The snow-white cotton, cotton wadding, cloth, clothes, etc. seen here are not made of cotton from cotton fields, but of Eulaliopsis binata, Broussonetia papyrifera bark, mulberry bark, banana peel, and even rice straw and rapeseed stalks. The whiteness, durability, and warmth retention of this kind of man-made cotton are no different from those of raw cotton. At the same time, the production cost is also very cheap. 100 jin (50 kg) of Eulaliopsis binata can be made into 80 jin (40 kg) of cotton, and the cost per jin is only about 0.52 yuan. From the pictures, the audience also saw the entire operating technical process of these wild fibers from raw materials to finished products. The techniques are very simple and easy to learn; with only a small amount of investment, production can be put into operation. The clothes, socks, towels, and various colored fabrics woven from rice straw fiber exhibited here are all made by local industries or handicraft cooperatives. Wild fibers can also be blended with raw cotton or wool to make high-grade textiles. The woolen fabric exhibited by the Chongqing China Wool Textile Factory, which is blended with half cotton stalk hemp and half wool, has beautiful colors. Made into women's coats, each piece costs only about 14 yuan. Laminated paper and kraft paper made of Eulaliopsis binata and bamboo shoot shells are also exhibited here. More than 140 kinds of wild fibers have now been discovered in Sichuan, with an estimated resource of about 6 million dan (300,000 metric tons). If all of them are utilized, it will be equivalent to the cotton produced by 8 million mu (533,333 hectares) of cotton fields.

Wild starch plants that can replace grain for brewing, replace flour for sizing yarn and making paste, can be made into vermicelli or used as pig feed have been confirmed in the wild starch exhibition room. From the various objects exhibited, we saw the wine brewed from Cyclobalanopsis glauca seeds, Pueraria thomsonii roots, Smilax glabra, and wild sweet potatoes in Guangyuan, Suining and other places. Its quality is not much different from that of ordinary wine brewed from grain. If fully utilized, the province can save 110 million jin (55,000 metric tons) of grain for the country every year.

In the wild fruit and wild chemical raw materials exhibition rooms, roasted glue manufactured from red roots, oak bowls, Sapindus mukorossi fruits, etc. and tanned leather utilized in Chengdu, Wanxian and other places were displayed. In the past, the roasted glue in my country's leather-making industry had to rely on imports. Now, if all six kinds of discovered roasted glue resources are fully utilized, 160,000 dan (8,000 metric tons) of roasted glue can be produced every year, which can meet market needs.

This exhibition has become a technical place for relevant departments in the province to learn to utilize wild plants. Eighteen provinces including Zhejiang, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Henan, and Shaanxi have also sent representatives to visit and study. They took away various samples, photos, and technical materials when they returned; and put forward the slogan "Seek wine, sugar, oil, and flour from the deep mountains" and "Seek cotton, paper, glue, and hemp from the old forests" to turn these previously neglected wild plants into social wealth.

### 向深山要酒要糖要油要粉  向老林要棉要纸要胶要麻  四川举办的展览会证明野生五宝取之不尽

    四川举办的展览会证明野生五宝取之不尽
    本报讯　本报记者范眭报道：在成都举行的野生五宝——纤维、油料、淀粉、果品、化工原料展览会，受到省内外群众的热烈欢迎。这个展览会是由四川省供销社和成都市第三商业局联合举办的。从3月16日开幕以来，平均每天有四千多人前往参观。许多来自各地的工业、供销社、手工业等代表们，在这里学习怎样把过去弃于山野的野生植物，充分地利用起来解决人民吃、穿、用的需要。
    展览会共分五个部分，以图片、实物介绍了全省可以利用的三百六十多种野生植物。这种用之不尽、取之不竭的野生资源，据初步估计，全省年产量达到三千七百九十五万担，不仅为地方工业的发展提供了充分的原料，并且每年能为全省农民增加一亿五千万元的收入。
    展览会的第一部分是野生油料展览室。这里展出的一百三十多种野生油料，出油率都在15％以上，可以用作食用、点灯、制皂、油漆和一般工业上的润滑油。其中产于达县、绵阳、温江等专区的楠木籽，含油量达到52％，是出油率最高的野生油料。这里展出的一种四川普遍生长的松籽，估计产量达一千万斤以上，可以产油二百五十万斤。深受群众喜爱的山苍籽油，浓馥的香味在展览室里经久不散，现在这种山苍籽油已经成为出口物资。一些普通不为人们注意的油源如牵牛花籽、菩提树籽、萝卜籽，经过这次展出，发现了它们的新用途。
    最使参观者惊讶的是野生纤维展览室。在这里看到的雪白的棉花、棉絮、布匹、衣服等，不是用棉田里的棉花制成，而是用蓑草、构树皮、桑树皮、芭蕉皮，甚至是稻草、油菜花秆制成的。这种人造棉花的洁白、耐用和保温程度，和原棉没有差别。同时生产成本也很便宜，一百斤蓑草就能制成八十斤棉花，每斤成本只要五角二分左右。从图片上，观众们还看到了这些野生纤维从原料到成品的全部操作技术过程。技术都很简单、易学；只要少量投资，就能投入生产。这里展出的用稻草纤维织成的衣服、袜子、毛巾、各色花布，都是由地方工业或手工业社制成的。野生纤维也可以与原棉或羊毛混纺成高级纺织品。展出的重庆中国毛纺织厂用棉秆麻和羊毛各一半混纺的呢绒，色泽美丽，制成女外套，每件价格仅十四元左右。这里还展出了用蓑草、笋壳制造的腊纸、牛皮纸。四川省现在已发现的野生纤维就有一百四十多种，估计资源约六百万担。如果全部利用起来，就相当于八百万亩棉田所产的棉花。
    能够代替粮食酿酒，代替面粉浆纱、制浆糊，可以制粉条或作猪饲料的野生淀粉植物，在野生淀粉展览室里得到了证实。从展出的各种实物中，看到了广元、遂宁等地用青杠籽、粉葛根、土茯苓、野地瓜酿造的酒。它的质量和一般用粮食酿的酒相差不大。如果充分利用起来，全省每年能替国家节省粮食一亿一千万斤。
    在野生果品和野生化工原料两个展览室里，陈列了成都、万县等地利用红根、橡碗、患香树果等制造烤胶和鞣制的皮革。我国制革工业中的烤胶，过去要依靠国外进口。现在如把已发现的六种烤胶资源全部利用起来，每年就可生产烤胶十六万担，可以满足市场需要。
    这个展览会已成了省内各有关部门学习利用野生植物的技术场所，浙江、辽宁、黑龙江、河南、陕西等十八个省也派了代表前来参观、学习。他们回去时带了各种样品、照片和技术资料；提出了“向深山要酒、要糖、要油、要粉”、“向老林要棉、要纸、要胶、要麻”的口号，要把这些以往被人轻视的野生植物变成社会财富。
