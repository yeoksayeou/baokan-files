Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th. Starting this year, regions north of the Huai River in our country will expand rice planting areas according to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's directive on large-scale rice planting. The implementation of this policy will rapidly increase grain production in low-yield areas north of the Huai River in our country. The Ministry of Agriculture recently convened the Northern Rice Production Increase Promotion Conference, focusing on studying measures to strive for a bumper rice harvest this year, and exchanging views on the planning of expanding rice planting in the north.

The representatives attending the conference unanimously agreed that expanding rice planting is a strategic political task to change the low-yield appearance of the regions north of the Huai River in our country, and that striving for a bumper rice harvest this year will pave the way for future expansion of rice planting. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the masses to do a deep, meticulous, and down-to-earth job in various tasks for expanding rice planting and striving for a bumper harvest. This conference was actually a battlefield mobilization meeting. At this conference, each province reported its rice planting targets for this year, and accounted for, assessed, exchanged experiences, learned methods, and solved many major ideological problems regarding important issues such as water sources, fertilizers, labor, farm tools, and organizational leadership in expanding rice planting, as well as the practical problems that urgently needed to be solved in the new and old rice-producing areas, creating favorable conditions for this year's rice harvest. The conference believes that to gradually expand the rice planting area in the north, all possible efforts must be made to strive for a bumper rice harvest this year. At present, special attention should be paid to not violating the farming season, ensuring the planting area, breeding sufficient strong seedlings as early as possible according to the planting plan, and transplanting the seedlings into the paddy fields fully and completely in a timely manner, without delaying or abandoning an acre of land. The conference proposed to tap water sources in various ways, reasonably organize labor, and mobilize the masses locally to manufacture water lifting tools and field production tools to solve the current problems in production. Self-reliance, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses are the only ways to solve these problems. The conference believes that this year's wheat stubble rice acreage is very large, and it is necessary to harvest the wheat well and transplant the rice seedlings well. Representatives from various regions visited Tuanbowa, where they used second-ditch water for irrigation, used rice straw clay instead of cement to build culverts, used steel pipes, wood, scrap iron drums, and brickwork to manufacture water pumps, and accumulated fertilizer at the field head. They also observed the practice of agricultural cooperatives working and holding meetings at the field head during the busy farming season, and found them to be very good mass creations. The conference also formulated several important production measures to ensure a bumper rice harvest based on the general situation in various regions, such as applying fertilizer well, adding water well, managing the fields well, and preparing to overcome possible floods and droughts. It proposed to carry out a large-scale high-yield rice movement, cultivate high-yield fields, eliminate backward fields and third-class seedlings, promote high yields in new and old rice-producing areas, and use experimental fields to promote production. The representatives attending the meeting believed that by firmly grasping the above measures, they would be able to strive for a bumper rice harvest this year, and that using these methods for sweet potatoes, corn, and other crops would also achieve great results. The conference believes that the party committees in many places have, in the previous stage of work, had their secretaries take action, mobilized the entire party, and established specialized leading organizations to lead the expansion of rice planting, ensuring the completion of rice seedling preparation work. In the struggle to implement future production increase measures and strive for a bumper harvest, it is also necessary to rely closely on the leadership and support of the party committees at all levels.

According to the feedback from representatives from various regions at the conference, the enthusiasm of farmers in various parts of the north for expanding rice planting is very high. Fourteen provinces, cities, and autonomous regions north of the Huai River have newly expanded rice planting by a total of 50 million mu this year. The rice field area in the northern provinces will increase from 30 million mu to more than 80 million mu. In many areas where conditions are already in place, the rice planting area has greatly expanded this year. At present, the preparatory work such as repairing canals, field ridges, soaking fields, and raising seedlings in these areas is nearing completion, and they are preparing to transplant seedlings. Soon, several new rice-producing areas, including more than 10 million mu, will appear in the Northeast Plain, along the coast of the Bohai Sea, in central Henan, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui. According to reports from various regions, the water sources are abundant, the soil is fertile, and the climate is suitable in various parts of the north. Many areas have already gained experience in rice planting, and the prospects for developing rice are very promising. At present, various regions are formulating long-term plans for expanding rice planting at each level. According to the self-reported figures from various regions at the conference, the rice field area in the northern provinces will expand to about 300 million mu by 1962.

During the conference, representatives from various regions visited the rice fields reclaimed on saline-alkali land in Tuanbowa, listened to the introduction of Zhao Ke, the first secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, on his experience in transforming low-lying land and developing rice, and were greatly encouraged. This special zone began to transform low-lying land for rice planting in 1955 and has expanded rice fields by 1 million mu. Last year alone, it increased grain production by more than 400 million jin, basically solving the food shortage problem in this area. Many representatives believe that what the Tianjin Special Zone can do, their own areas can certainly do. At this conference, many old rice-producing areas, such as the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province, Xiaozhan in Tianjin, and the Hetao Administrative Region in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, also introduced their experience in increasing rice production and expressed their determination to overcome conservative ideas, further increase rice field yields, and vigorously support the development of rice in new rice-producing areas.

The Northern Rice Production Increase Promotion Conference was held in Tuanbowa, Tianjin Special Zone, Hebei Province, from April 20 to 26. More than 300 agricultural and water conservancy cadres from 14 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions north of the Huai River and some counties attended the conference. Relevant departments such as the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Economic Commission also sent people to participate in the conference.

    多种水稻改变北方低产面貌
    水稻会议研究今年增产措施和扩种计划
    新华社天津28日电　从今年开始，我国淮河以北地区将根据中共中央指示的关于大量种植水稻的方针，扩大水稻种植面积。实现这个方针，将使我国淮河以北低产地区的粮食产量迅速提高。农业部最近召开的北方水稻增产促进会议，着重研究了力争今年水稻丰收的措施，并就北方扩种水稻规划问题交换了意见。
    参加会议的代表一致认为，扩种水稻是改变我国淮河以北地区低产面貌的一项具有战略性的政治任务，而争得今年水稻的丰收，将为今后扩种水稻开辟顺畅的道路。因此，必须依靠群众深入地细致地踏实地做好扩种水稻力争丰收的各项工作。这次会议实际上是一次战地动员会议。在这次会议上，各省都报告了今年种植水稻的指标，并就扩种水稻中的水源、肥料、劳力、农具和组织领导等重要问题，算了账，摸了底，交流了经验，学习了办法，解决了许多重大的思想问题，也解决了新老稻区迫切需要解决的实际问题，给今年的水稻丰收创造了良好的条件。会议认为，逐步扩大北方水稻种植面积，必须千方百计争取今年的水稻丰收。在当前应特别注意不违农时，保证种植面积，按照种植计划及早育好足够壮秧，适时满栽、满插地把秧苗栽种到稻田里，不耽误，不抛荒一亩地。会议提出，要多方挖掘水源，合理组织劳力，就地发动群众制造提水工具和田间生产工具来解决当前生产中的问题。要自力更生，依靠群众与发动群众，才能得到解决。会议认为，今年麦茬稻数量很大，既要收好麦又要插好秧。各地代表参观了团泊洼使用二淋水灌溉，用稻草胶泥代替水泥建筑涵闸，用钢管、木头、废铁桶、砖砌等制造水泵以及在地头积肥、农忙时农业社在地头办公、开会等许多群众性创造，认为很好。会议还根据各地一般情况，制订了施好肥、加好水、作好田间管理、有准备地战胜可能发生的水旱灾害等保证水稻丰收的几项重要生产措施；提出了开展水稻大面积丰产运动，培养丰产田消灭落后田、三类苗，推动新老稻区实现丰产和用试验田来推动生产的方法。到会代表们认为，紧紧抓住上述措施，就能够争取今年的水稻丰收，把这些办法用于甘薯、玉米等其他作物，也一定会取得很大效果。会议认为，许多地方的党委在前一段工作中，书记动手，全党动员，建立专门领导组织机构来领导扩种水稻，保证了稻秧准备工作的完成。在实现今后各项增产措施力争丰收的斗争中，也必须要紧紧依靠各地党委的领导和支持。
    根据各地代表在会议上的反映，北方各地农民扩种水稻的热情都很高。淮河以北十四个省、市、自治区，今年新扩种的水稻共达五千万亩，北方各省的稻田面积将在三千万亩的基础上增加到八千多万亩。现在条件已经具备的许多地区，今年水稻的种植面积都有大量的发展。目前，这些地区的修渠道、田埂、泡田、育秧等准备工作已接近结束，正准备插秧。不久，我国北方的东北平原、渤海沿岸、豫中、苏北和皖北等地，将出现几个包括千万亩以上的新稻区。据各地汇报，北方各地水源充足，土壤肥沃，气候适宜，许多地区已取得了种稻经验，发展水稻的前途非常远大。现在各地正逐级制订扩种水稻的远景规划。根据各地在会上的自报数字统计，到1962年北方各省的稻田面积将扩大到三亿亩左右。
    会议期间，各地代表参观了团泊洼在盐碱地上开垦的稻田，听了中共天津地委第一书记赵克改造洼地发展水稻的经验介绍，受到很大鼓舞。这个专区从1955年开始改造洼地种植水稻，已扩大稻田一百万亩。仅去年，即增产了四亿多斤粮食，基本上解决了这个地区的缺粮困难。许多代表认为，天津专区能做的事情，自己地区也一定能做到。在这次会议上，吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州、天津小站、内蒙古自治区河套行政区等许多老稻区，也介绍了他们的水稻增产经验，并表示要克服保守思想进一步提高稻田产量，大力支援新稻区的水稻发展。
    北方水稻增产促进会议于4月20日到26日在河北省天津专区的团泊洼召开。参加会议的有淮河以北的十四个省市自治区和部分县的农业水利干部三百多人。中共中央农村工作部、国家经济委员会等有关部门，也派人参加了这次会议。
