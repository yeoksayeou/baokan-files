    Agriculture as the main body, with supply and marketing, credit, and handicrafts oriented towards agriculture, supporting agriculture, collaborating with each other, and leaping forward together – this is the principle for strengthening rural economic collaboration proposed by Zong'ai Township in Shouyang County, Shanxi Province. This principle is correct. It solves the problem of primary and secondary aspects in collaboration, giving grassroots financial and trade departments a clear direction for serving agricultural production. Centered on agricultural production, financial and trade departments can formulate purchasing, sales, supply, and inventory plans that suit actual needs, and agricultural leap forward plans will have a reliable material guarantee. In this way, the plans of production departments and financial and trade departments are closely linked, preparing conditions for the common high tide of the rural economy.
    Collaboration in economic work must first have ideological collaboration. Only by first breaking down departmentalism and abandoning the purely profit-seeking viewpoint can we overcome the phenomenon of mutual disconnection and mutual obstruction, and pave the way for collaboration. The large-scale collaboration in Zong'ai Township emerged precisely on this ideological basis. Therefore, when promoting the experience of Zong'ai Township, we must not neglect the more important link of ideological work.

    经济协作先要思想协作
    农业为主体，供销、信用、手工业面向农业，支援农业，互相协作，一齐跃进，这是山西寿阳县宗艾乡提出的加强农村经济协作的方针。这个方针是正确的。它解决了协作中的主次问题，使基层财贸部门有了为农业生产服务的明确方向。围绕农业生产这个中心，财贸部门就可以订出适合实际需要的购、销、供应和存货计划，农业跃进计划也就有了可靠的物质保证。这样，生产部门和财贸部门的计划就紧密地衔接起来了，为农村经济共同高涨准备了条件。
    经济工作上的协作，首先必须要有思想上的协作。只有先打破本位主义思想和放弃单纯营利观点，才能克服互不联系、互相扯皮的现象，才能为协作铺平道路。宗艾乡的大协作正是在这个思想基础上出现的。因此，在推广宗艾乡的经验的时候，绝不能忽视思想工作这个更重要的环节。
