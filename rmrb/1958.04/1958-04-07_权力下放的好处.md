The investment remains basically the same, the time is still four years, and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant can expand the originally planned medium-sized iron and steel plant into a large-scale iron and steel complex. This is really good news.

The reason these potentials can be tapped is, on the one hand, the result of the plant's opposition to conservatism and waste, and on the other hand, it is also due to the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry breaking with convention and using the "contracting" method to hand over basic construction investment to the plant. If the old method was still used, with everything decided by the higher authorities through "contracting," then no matter how thoroughly the conservatism below was opposed, it would probably be difficult to have such a great leap forward.

After the State Council promulgated the three regulations on improving the industrial, commercial, and financial management systems, the enthusiasm of the lower levels was greatly increased, and many things that could not be done in the past are now possible. The experiment of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry once again proves the benefits of decentralization.

    权力下放的好处
    投资基本不变，时间还是四年，石景山钢铁厂可以把原来准备扩建的中型钢铁厂扩建成为大型钢铁联合企业，这真是一个好消息。
    这些潜力所以能挖掘出来，一方面固然是厂里反保守、反浪费的收获，另一方面，也是由于冶金部打破陈规，改用“包干”的办法，把基本建设投资交给厂里掌握。如果还是沿用旧的办法，通统由上面“包干”决定，那么，不管下面的保守反得多么透彻，恐怕还是很难有这么一个大跃进的。
    国务院公布关于改进工业、商业和财政管理体制的三个规定，把一部分权力下放之后，下面的积极性大大提高，许多过去办不到的事情，现在都可能办到了。冶金部的尝试，再一次地证明权力下放的好处。
