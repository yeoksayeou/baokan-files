Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, April 9th. Newspapers here today published a letter from the Romanian National Agricultural Workers' Conference to all agricultural laborers in the country. The letter calls on agricultural workers to use all their strength to economically consolidate and develop the socialist agricultural sector, and also calls on individual farmers to take the road of collectivization.

    This conference was recently held in Constanta by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers. The letter to all agricultural laborers states that economically consolidating and developing collective farms is the main condition for establishing socialism in the countryside. All members of the farms should pay attention to the growth of public property and farm funds.

    At present, the basic task of agricultural cooperatives is to cooperate in major labor aspects and expand the use of agricultural machinery. The conference called on members of agricultural cooperatives to collectively purchase livestock and jointly undertake ventures that can increase income, in order to prepare conditions for the transition to collective farms.

    The conference called on the staff of state-owned farms to vigorously increase the output of major grains so as to become the main supplier of grain needed by the state in a short period of time.

    The conference also called on the staff of machine tractor stations to meet the needs of the socialist agricultural sector for mechanization as much as possible, complete tasks on time and ensure the quality of work, and carry out socialist labor competitions.

    The letter to all agricultural laborers calls on all agricultural workers to strive to increase grain production, especially wheat and corn.
