Xinhua News Agency, Cape Canaveral, 20th: The U.S. Air Force's test launch of a "Thor" intercontinental missile at the Cape Canaveral missile test site on the 19th failed again. The test launch only resulted in a loud explosion of the missile.

    According to eyewitnesses, after the missile was launched, only a cloud of thick smoke rushed into the sky, followed by a loud noise that shook the surrounding dozens of miles. Thus, another "Thor" missile bit the dust.

    The U.S. Air Force authorities in charge of the experiment said that the failure was due to "technical difficulties."

    This missile test was the second "secret" test conducted by the United States in two consecutive days. A medium-range missile tested on the 18th also failed.

    秘密试验　公开失败
    美又一颗洲际导弹完蛋
    新华社20日讯　卡纳维拉尔角讯：美国空军19日在卡纳维拉尔角导弹试验场试射“雷神”式洲际导弹又遭失败。试射的结果只是换来了导弹爆炸的一声巨响。
    据目击者谈，导弹发射后只见一团浓烟冲向天空，紧接着就是一声声震数十里的巨响，就这样，又一颗“雷神”式导弹完蛋了。
    主持试验的美国空军当局说，试验失败是由于“技术困难”。
    这次导弹试验是美国在连续两天中进行的第二次“偷偷的”试验，在18日试射的一颗中程导弹也失败了。
