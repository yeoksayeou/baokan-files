    White plum blossoms, red peach blossoms, our cooperative adds new members today. What will the new members do? Cadres of Chairman Mao become farmers.
      (Qishan, Shaanxi, originally published in "Mass Art") Dense leaves and honey peaches take deep root. To have a good harvest, we rely on diligence. There are treasures everywhere in the mountains. We are determined to settle down and explore the treasures.
      (Nanzheng, Shaanxi, same source) Red flowers bloom all over the mountains, each red flower is lovely. Cadres sent to work in the countryside arrive in the mountains, like red flowers blooming everywhere. Flowers bloom to bear sweet fruit, cadres come to the mountains to build.
      (Sichuan "Spark") The cooperative sets up a reunion dinner, and every member is as happy as immortals. The self-grown melons and fruits are sweet and big, and the self-raised fish are fat and fresh. This year, there are distinguished guests at the table, and the members respectfully seat him at the head. The girls call him county head, but he says they should call him member.

    咱社今日添新人
    （新山歌）李花白，桃花红，咱社今日添新人。要问新人做什么？毛主席的干部当农民。
  （陕西岐山，原载“群众艺术”）浓叶蜜桃扎根深，要想丰收靠人勤，山区处处有财宝，落户探宝有决心。
  （陕西南郑，同上）满山遍野红花开，朵朵红花逗人爱，下放干部上山来，好比红花朵朵开；花开为了结甜果，干部上山建设来。
      （四川“星星”）社里摆起团圆饭，社员个个乐如仙，自种瓜果甜又大，自养鱼儿肥又鲜，今年桌上添佳客，社员尊他坐上边，姑娘称他为县长，他说应该叫社员。
  （福建“新农村报”）
