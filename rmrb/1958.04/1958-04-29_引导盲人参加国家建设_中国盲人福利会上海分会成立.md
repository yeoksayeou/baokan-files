    Guiding the Blind to Participate in National Construction
    The Shanghai Branch of the China Blind Welfare Association is Established
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. The Shanghai Branch of the China Blind Welfare Association was established on the 24th. The vast number of blind people in Shanghai were extremely happy and encouraged. At the founding meeting, gongs and drums were sounded, and firecrackers were set off. Many people wrote guarantees and letters of determination in Braille or Chinese characters, expressing their gratitude to the Party and the government and their determination to actively participate in socialist construction.
    The main tasks of this branch are to closely connect with the blind masses, guide the blind to participate in socialist construction, and carry out blind welfare work in a planned and step-by-step manner.
    In recent years, with the care of the Party and the government, Shanghai's blind welfare work has greatly developed. Helpless blind people have long been taken in by relevant departments, and more than two hundred blind people who have lost their ability to work are spending their twilight years in Shanghai nursing homes. The government also regularly provides relief and subsidies to blind people with difficult lives scattered in various places. Various recreational activities are often held in areas where blind people are concentrated. More than one hundred adult blind people are learning Braille in six cultural classes. The Shanghai Municipal School for the Blind has grown to twelve classes, and the number of students has doubled since 1952.
    In recent years, Shanghai's blind people have made positive contributions to national construction. More than two hundred blind people in the city have participated in labor production suitable for their characteristics. The Shanghai Blind Nail Factory now produces about 2,000 catties of nails for the country every day. He Hongde (a blind person), deputy director of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Electrical Appliance Factory, has designed and improved various machines since 1956. The horizontal punch press he designed has increased battery production by four times compared to the past. Many blind people also actively participate in neighborhood propaganda, greening, and other work.

    引导盲人参加国家建设
    中国盲人福利会上海分会成立
    新华社讯　中国盲人福利会上海分会24日成立。上海广大盲人极为欢欣鼓舞，成立会上锣鼓鞭炮齐鸣，许多人都用盲文或汉文写了保证书和决心书，表示他们对党、政府的感激心情和积极参加社会主义建设的决心。
    这个分会的主要任务是密切联系盲人群众，引导盲人参加社会主义建设，有计划有步骤地开展盲人福利事业。
    几年来，在党和政府的关怀下，上海盲人福利事业有了很大发展。无依无靠的盲人早已被有关部门收容起来，二百多个已经丧失劳动能力的盲人，正在上海养老院安度晚年。政府对于分散在各处的生活困难的盲人，也经常给予救济和补助。在盲人集中的地方，经常举办各种娱乐活动。一百多个成年盲人，在六个文化班里利用盲文进行学习。上海市盲童学校已发展到十二个班级，学生数比1952年增加了一倍。
    几年来，上海的盲人对国家建设作出了积极的贡献。全市有二百多个盲人，参加了适合他们特点的劳动生产。上海市盲人制钉工厂，现在每天为国家生产钉子二千斤左右。上海工商电器厂副厂长贺宏德（盲人），1956年以来设计和改进多种机器，他设计的横式冲床使电池产量比过去提高四倍。许多盲人还积极参加里弄的宣传、绿化等工作。
