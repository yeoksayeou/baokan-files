The Romanian Economic Exhibition opens in Beijing today. This is the first large-scale exhibition held by Romania abroad. The holding of this exhibition is an important event in Sino-Romanian economic cooperation. This can not only enable our people to further understand the socialist construction achievements of the fraternal Romanian people and draw strength from them to encourage our people's socialist construction, but also promote the development of trade between China and Romania and further strengthen the economic cooperation between the two countries.
    The Romanian people are victoriously building a new socialist life with selfless labor. In the more than thirteen years since liberation, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Romanian people have transformed their country from a backward agricultural country into a country with relatively developed industry and agriculture. Romania is rich in petroleum. After liberation, the petroleum industry got rid of the shackles of foreign capital and achieved rapid development, with a substantial increase in output. From 1951 to 1956, in just six years, Romania's oil production was equal to that of the twenty years before liberation. Due to the establishment of new industrial sectors such as the metallurgical industry, the machinery industry, the chemical industry, the electrical machinery industry, and oil mining, Romania's industrial base has been greatly expanded. The industrial output value now accounts for 60.4% of the total national economy. In 1957, Romania's total industrial output increased 3.2 times compared with 1948. The speed of Romania's industrial development, like that of all socialist countries, is not only incomparable to that of Romania before liberation, but also incomparable to that of capitalist countries. At present, Romania's crude oil extraction speed is 6.5 times faster than that of the United States; iron ore extraction speed is 5.1 times faster than that of the United States and 1.7 times faster than that of France. Since liberation, Romania's agriculture has also made significant progress. Last year, the harvest of most Romanian crops exceeded the highest level of the past forty years. Based on the development of production, people's lives are constantly improving. Romania's significant achievements in industrial and agricultural production powerfully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system.
    The continuous development of Romania's socialist economy enables it to play an increasingly important role in international economic cooperation. At present, Romania has economic ties with seventy countries in the world. Romania, together with the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, has established a new type of economic relationship based on the principles of internationalism, mutual assistance, cooperation, equality, and mutual benefit. Since China and Romania signed a trade agreement in 1951, the growth of trade between the two countries has been very rapid. Compared with 1951, Sino-Romanian trade in 1958 increased by more than 81 times. Through trade agreements, Romania has provided China with various machines and equipment, including petroleum industry equipment, power station equipment, cement plant equipment, tractors, petroleum, and chemical industry raw materials, etc. China has provided Romania with raw materials, agricultural products, and consumer goods. The rapid development of economic cooperation between China and Romania is very beneficial to the socialist construction of our two countries. In particular, Romania's provision of petroleum products and dispatch of experts in the petroleum industry to China have been of great help to China's socialist construction. The joint statement issued by the governments of China and Romania earlier this month emphasized that the two sides will continue to take measures to further develop cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields and will hold negotiations on the signing of a long-term trade agreement between China and Romania in the near future. This Romanian Economic Exhibition held in China is an important new measure to strengthen Sino-Romanian economic cooperation.
    The Romanian Economic Exhibition is a large-scale and rich exhibition. There are more than 1,860 boxes of exhibits, weighing more than 1,200 tons, including the world's most advanced giant oil drilling rigs and other heavy industrial machinery, light industrial products, and agricultural products. The rich and diverse Romanian industrial and agricultural products exhibited this time fully reflect the great achievements of Romania's socialist economic construction, and make us deeply believe that there is a very broad prospect for further developing economic cooperation between China and Romania.
    Not long ago, the Romanian government delegation headed by Comrade Chivu Stoica, Chairman of the Romanian Council of Ministers, visited our country and made a significant contribution to strengthening the fraternal friendship between our two countries. This Romanian Economic Exhibition held in our country will further enhance the understanding and friendship between the people of our two countries. After the exhibition is held in Beijing, it will also be held in Shanghai. We express our warm welcome to Romania for holding the Economic Exhibition in our country. We heartily congratulate the exhibition on its success and wish the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people to be further developed and consolidated!

    加强中罗经济合作的新步骤
    罗马尼亚经济展览会今天在北京开幕。这是罗马尼亚第一次在国外举行的大规模的展览会。这个展览会的举行，是中罗经济合作中的一件重要的事情。这不仅可以使我国人民进一步了解兄弟般的罗马尼亚人民的社会主义建设成就，从中吸取鼓舞我国人民建设社会主义的力量；而且可以促进中罗两国贸易的发展，进一步加强两国的经济合作。
    罗马尼亚人民正以忘我的劳动精神，胜利地建设着社会主义的新生活。解放十三年多的时间里，罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，已经把自己的国家从一个落后的农业国，建设成为一个工业和农业都已相当发达的国家。罗马尼亚盛产石油，解放后石油工业摆脱了外国资本的束缚，获得迅速的发展，产量大大提高。从1951年到1956年六年中，罗马尼亚的石油产量就等于解放前二十年的产量。由于冶金工业、机械工业、化学工业、电机工业和油矿开采等新的工业部门的建立，罗马尼亚的工业基础大大扩大了。工业产值已占国民经济全部产值的60.4％。1957年罗马尼亚工业总产量比1948年增加了三点二倍。罗马尼亚工业发展的速度，也同所有社会主义国家一样，不仅解放前的罗马尼亚不能比拟，而且资本主义国家也不能比拟。现在，罗马尼亚原油开采速度比美国快六点五倍；铁矿开采速度比美国快五点一倍，比法国快一点七倍。解放后，罗马尼亚的农业也有了显著的提高，去年罗马尼亚大多数农作物收获量超过了过去四十年的最高水平。在生产发展的基础上，人民生活不断提高。罗马尼亚工农业生产上的重大成就，有力地说明了社会主义制度的优越性。
    罗马尼亚社会主义经济的不断发展，使它在国际经济合作中起着越来越大的作用。目前，罗马尼亚同世界上七十个国家有着经济联系。罗马尼亚同苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家之间，根据国际主义的原则，在互助合作、平等互利的基础上，建立了新型的经济关系。中罗两国自从1951年签订了贸易协定之后，两国贸易额的增长十分迅速，同1951年比较，1958年中罗贸易额增长了八十一倍多。通过贸易协定，罗马尼亚向我国提供了各种机器和设备，其中包括石油工业设备、电站设备、水泥厂设备、拖拉机、石油和化学工业原料等。我国向罗马尼亚提供了原料、农产品和消费品等。中罗两国间经济合作的迅速发展，十分有利于我们两国的社会主义建设事业。特别是罗马尼亚向我国提供的石油产品和派遣的石油工业方面的专家，对于我国社会主义建设有很大的帮助。本月上旬中罗两国政府发表的联合声明强调指出，双方将继续采取措施进一步发展两国间的政治、经济和文化方面的合作，并将于最近期间举行中罗两国签订长期贸易协定的谈判。这次罗马尼亚在我国举行经济展览会，就是加强中罗经济合作的重要的新措施。
    罗马尼亚经济展览会是一个规模巨大、内容丰富的展览会。展品共有一千八百六十多箱，重一千二百多吨，其中包括世界上最先进的巨型石油钻探机和其他重工业机器、轻工业品、农业品等。这次展出的丰富多样的罗马尼亚工农业产品，充分地反映了罗马尼亚社会主义经济建设的巨大成就，并使我们深信，进一步发展中罗两国的经济合作有着极广阔的前途。
    不久前以罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡同志为首的罗马尼亚政府代表团访问我国，对于加强我们两国兄弟般的友好关系作出了重大的贡献。这次罗马尼亚经济展览会在我国举行，将会更加增进我们两国人民的了解和友谊。这个展览会在北京举行以后，还要到上海去举行。我们对罗马尼亚在我国举行经济展览会表示热烈的欢迎，我们衷心地祝贺展览会获得成功，并祝中罗两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的友谊进一步发展和巩固！
