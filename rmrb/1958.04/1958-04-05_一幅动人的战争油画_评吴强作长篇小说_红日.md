    A Moving War Painting
    —A Review of Wu Qiang's Novel "Red Sun"
    Ning Gan

    Wu Qiang's "Red Sun" is widely welcomed by readers, and this is by no means accidental. First of all, this novel has a grand scale, like a huge oil painting depicting war, with strong colors and numerous characters, but the structure is simple and clear. It takes a unit led by Military Commander Shen Zhenxin as the main line and unfolds a magnificent description around the two famous battles on the Shandong battlefield during the Liberation War (the Laiwu and Menglianggu battles). It not only vividly depicts the war situation at that time and the grand atmosphere of the war and the scenes of fierce fighting, but also truly reflects the heroic, resourceful, and arduous struggle of our army through the portrayal of various characters. The most prominent feature is the outstanding depiction of our army's strategic thinking and revolutionary (collective) heroism, which makes it very attractive.

    Everyone knows that winning a battle is not easy. From the army's point of view, in addition to the need for a brave and tenacious fighting style, it also requires correct strategic and tactical command. Therefore, if the author neglects to describe any of these points, it is impossible to write well about the war situation in a certain period or region.

    In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek tore up the truce agreement and, with the support of American imperialism, launched a full-scale offensive against our liberated areas. After running into snags, he concentrated his superior forces to launch key offensives against the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shandong liberated areas. At that time, the enemy invested a total of more than 500,000 troops in Shandong, and took his Imperial Guard 74th Division as the spearhead, advancing from south to north, first occupying Linyi, and then capturing Lianshui. At the same time, Li Xianzhou, entrenched in Jinan, led more than 60,000 people to attack from north to south, vainly attempting to annihilate the main force of our Shandong People's Liberation Army in the Lunan mountainous area. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's military thinking of "primarily annihilating the enemy's effective strength" through mobile warfare, our army made great strides forward and great strides backward, first turning north to eat up Li Xianzhou's more than 60,000 people, and then transferring the entire American-equipped Chiang's Imperial Guard 74th Division to Menglianggu in the Yimeng Mountains, annihilating them all. This reversed the Shandong war situation, turning from strategic defense to strategic offense. This is the face of the Shandong war situation reflected in "Red Sun" and the strategic command thinking of our army.

    Literary works are different from writing war history; they must explain the problems through the portrayal of characters and the description of life. The novel "Red Sun" does not directly bring out Marshal Chen Yi and General Su Yu, the commanders of our Shandong battlefield at that time. It only describes the war situation and our army's strategic command vividly and skillfully through the depiction of Military Commander Shen Zhenxin and his unit.

    The Chiang army's 74th Division was the mortal enemy of Shen Zhenxin's army. In the Lianshui defense battle, Shen Zhenxin's army was defeated by the 74th Division, and everyone from top to bottom was frustrated. Although they participated in the Laiwu Campaign, annihilated Li Xianzhou, and won a great victory, they were still not satisfied. Because they felt that only by annihilating the 74th Division could they win honor for the troops. After the Laiwu Campaign, in order to mobilize the enemy and create opportunities for battle, the troops began to circle in the Yimeng Mountains. At that time, the middle and lower-level commanders and soldiers did not understand the intentions of their superiors. The seven consecutive days of night marches were too tiring. Legs were swollen and feet were blistered. They began to complain:

    "Where are we going to camp?"
    "Either 'Dawn Village' or 'Sunrise Town.'"
    "Is this fighting a war?"
    "It's a battle between feet and stones."
    "If we drag on for a few more days, we'll be dragged to death even if we're not killed in battle."

    At this moment, the sound of artillery fire came from the southeast, and it was said that the mortal enemy, the "74th Division," had arrived. As a result, the troops received an order: stop advancing and wait for action. The commanders and fighters immediately became excited. They rubbed their fists and sharpened their palms, preparing to avenge the defeat in the Battle of Lianshui against the "74th Division." Some people were so happy that they even composed songs about fighting the 74th Division.

    The troops stopped for a short time, and then were ordered to continue advancing; moreover, it was a forced march. The commanders and fighters were even happier, thinking that they must be going to fight the 74th Division. However, the further they went, the further away from the sound of artillery fire they got. It turned out that the direction was wrong. The artillery fire was in the southeast, but the troops were advancing in the southwest direction. Moreover, from the next day, they changed from night marches to daytime marches. The bugles, which were never used in night marches, were also blown. Obviously, the 74th Division could not be fought. Since there was no battle to fight and the situation was not tense, the troops continued to march eighty li every day, regardless of the wind or rain. The soldiers couldn't understand, the company commanders were unhappy, and the regimental commanders were also uncomfortable... A few days later, when they were ordered to turn back and annihilate the 74th Division with a forced march, they suddenly understood that the superiors had ordered them to go southwest and change night marches to day marches in order to lure the 74th Division to Menglianggu. What a fascinating description! What a powerful and lifelike description!

    War is ever-changing. After luring the enemy to the predetermined location, it does not mean that they have been annihilated. The enemy is not stupid. They have command and arrangements. They have good equipment. They can force soldiers to charge and kill with military law. Despite this, the class nature of the reactionary army destined them to perish. Here, the success of the work lies in the author's detailed portrayal of the enemy commanders in the two famous battles. It not only vividly depicts Li Xianzhou's indecisive, cunning, and slippery character, and Zhang Lingfu's arrogant, complacent, and headstrong character, but also vividly shows the essence of the reactionary army, which is corrupt, brutal, factional, does not support each other, and always wants to sacrifice others to preserve its own strength, through the description of them. Among them, because the author gave the characters life, because the author wrote about how the enemy went from arrogant offensive to struggling counterattacks, wanting to get rid of the fate of being annihilated, but finally perished due to soldiers' war-weariness, people's lack of support, etc., this true struggle process is very convincing to read.

    In the process of describing our army's victory in the battle, similarly, the author not only made detailed portrayals of many characters such as Military Commander Shen Zhenxin, Regimental Commander Liu Sheng, Company Commander Shi Donggen, and Squad Leader Qin Shouben, vividly depicting their different personality traits and their highly responsible class qualities for the war, but also prominently demonstrated our army's high degree of revolutionary heroism through them, truly reflecting the fighting life of our army at that time.

    It is impossible to comment on all the main characters in this article. Just talking about the portrayal of the character Regimental Commander Liu Sheng is enough to illustrate the problem.

    After the defeat in the Lianshui battle, Regimental Commander Liu Sheng, like all the commanders and fighters in the army, was filled with resentment. He always felt that only by annihilating the Chiang army's 74th Division could he win back the honor of the troops. Therefore, annihilating the 74th Division was his (and everyone in the army's) top priority, but this alone could not give Liu Sheng life. Liu Sheng loved the troops and cherished the honor of the troops more than his own life. These were just common characteristics shared by everyone in our army in the historical life at that time. In addition, he—Liu Sheng—also had his own personality: simplicity and straightforwardness were his advantages, while being too rigid and having a quick temper were his shortcomings. The overcoming of shortcomings—the growth of personality—is inseparable from the era in which the character lives. In other words, how to reflect the struggle life at that time in the process of describing the growth of the character is an important issue for writers. If this issue is not resolved well, the character will not be able to stand, and the work will not be successful.

    Comrade Wu Qiang fully understands this and firmly grasps it.

    After retreating from the defeat in the Lianshui battle, Liu Sheng's regiment suffered a lot of damage, and the equipment was naturally very poor. At this time, news of the great victory of the brother troops in the Yizao campaign came. In contrast, he, like others, was of course stimulated. At that time, Political Director Pan Wenfan said to him with an envious tone: "This battle was well fought, and hundreds of cannons, big and small, were captured!" He sneered and said: "Jealous? That's their skill." Pan Wenfan didn't mind and further said to Liu Sheng: "Can we ask the superiors to allocate a few cannons to us?" Liu Sheng said with disgust: "Are you embarrassed? Do you want to be shameless?" When Pan further persuaded him: "What does it matter, we are all in one big family..." he threw away his cigarette and said angrily: "Am I begging? Even if I'm so poor that I have no food to eat, I won't go begging."

    Didn't Liu Sheng want cannons? He wanted them, but, first of all, the troops were angry because they had been defeated in battle, and secondly, he was too rigid and believed that he should get cannons himself with his own ability. At the same time, he was also a little unhappy with the political commissar and director who came from intellectual backgrounds. At this time, he was not yet mature, and he was impulsive, temperamental, and didn't consider whether the other party had good intentions or bad intentions, nor did he care whether the other party could bear it. During the Laiwu campaign to annihilate Li Xianzhou, when the troops could not attack, he became angry and wanted to fight hard. After annihilating Li Xianzhou, in order to mobilize the enemy's 74th Division, when the troops were circling in the Yimeng Mountains, the military commander ordered his regiment to be inserted into the Shage area west of Luxinan to set up an ambush. Because he did not understand the intentions of his superiors, he thought that other regiments had gone to participate in the battle to fight the 74th Division, and, like the middle and lower-level cadres, he complained and grumbled, even saying things like "Why didn't you call us to fight the 74th Division? Is our regiment not born to our parents?" However, he was a pure and honest person. He never cared about anything with anyone. Whatever he was unhappy about, it was over after he got angry. He never held grudges against anyone who contradicted him. When he found that he had done something wrong or said something wrong, he also sincerely accepted criticism and strived to improve. And with each criticism he received, he matured a step further. Finally, in the battle to capture Zhang Lingfu alive on Menglianggu, he had been tempered to complete maturity. Zhang Lingfu stubbornly resisted relying on the terrain, and his troops suffered a lot of damage, but at this time, he was able to control himself and no longer use his temper to fight hard. Instead, he used his brains and wisdom to overcome difficulties and climb the mountain. But just as he was climbing the mountain, he was seriously injured. Before he died, he ordered: "Organize the troops, attack to the top of Menglianggu Mountain, and capture Zhang Lingfu and bring him to me to see..."

    Our army's high degree of revolutionary heroism and the arduous struggle life at that time are vividly and truly reflected through the character Liu Sheng and many other characters.

    In addition to writing about battles, the novel also writes about the rear life during the war, the people's support, and the family life and love life of several main characters such as the military commander, the staff officer, and the soldiers in the war life. These have their own merits, and they cannot be discussed one by one in this short article. Of course, it should also be admitted that this novel is somewhat rough in terms of language training and the description of certain life details, but small flaws cannot obscure great virtues. Therefore, I would like to recommend this novel to readers.

    一幅动人的战争油画
    ——评吴强作长篇小说“红日”
    宁干
    吴强同志的“红日”受到广大读者的欢迎，这决不是偶然的。首先，这部小说的气魄很大，好像一幅描写战争的巨幅油画，色彩强烈，人物众多，但结构却简洁而明快。它以军长沈振新所率领的一支部队为主线，围绕着解放战争时期山东战场上的两大著名战役
  （莱芜和孟良崮战役）展开了波涛壮阔的描写，不仅把当时的战局和那种声势浩大的大战气氛和激战图景生动地勾绘出来了，而且通过对各种人物的刻划，真实地反映了我军的英勇机智和艰苦奋战的斗争生活，这当中，最突出的特点是对我军战略思想和革命的
  （集体的）英雄主义，作了出色的描写，因而看来非常吸引人。
    谁都知道，打胜仗，不是容易的事。从军队本身来说，除了需要英勇顽强的战斗作风之外，还需要正确的战略和战术指挥。因此作者如果忽略了对其中任何一点的描写，都不可能把一个时期或一个地区的战争面貌写好。
    1946年，蒋介石撕毁停战协定，在美帝国主义支持下，向我解放区发起全面进攻碰壁之后，就集中优势兵力，对我陕北和山东两解放区发起了重点进攻。当时，敌人投入山东的兵力共有五十多万，并把他的御林军七十四师，拿出来作矛头尖，由南向北打，先侵占了临沂，后攻下了涟水，同时，盘据在济南的李仙洲，率六万多人由北向南打，妄想把我山东解放军主力消灭在鲁南山区。我军在毛主席的“以歼灭敌人有生力量为主”的运动战的军事思想指导之下，大踏步前进，大踏步后退，先掉头北上吃掉了李仙洲六万多人，而后又把全部美械化的蒋家御林军七十四师，调动到沂蒙山区的孟良崮，全部歼灭，从此扭转了山东战局，由战略防御转入了战略进攻。这就是“红日”所反映的山东战局的面貌和我军的战略指挥思想。
    文学作品不同于写战史，它要通过对人物的刻划和对生活的描写来说明问题的。小说“红日”并没有正面把当时我山东战场上的统帅陈毅元帅和粟裕将军搬出场来，只通过对军长沈振新和他的部队的描写，就把战局面貌和我军战略指挥生动而巧妙地写出来了。
    蒋军七十四师，是沈振新这个军的死对头，在涟水防守战中，沈振新这个军，吃了七十四师的败仗，从上至下都窝了气，虽然，他们参加莱芜战役，歼灭了李仙洲，获得大胜，但仍不满足。因为，他们感到只有消灭了七十四师才算给部队争得了荣誉，莱芜战役之后，为了调动敌人，制造战机，部队在沂蒙山区转起圈子来，当时，中下级指挥员和战士们不了解上级意图，七天的连续夜行军，走得太累了。腿肿脚起泡；都说起怪话来：
    “到什么地方宿营？”
    “不是‘天亮庄’就是‘日出村’。”
    “这叫打仗吗？”
    “是脚板和石头战斗。”
    “再拖几天，打不死也就拖死了。”
    正在这时，东南方向传来轰炮声，传说是对头冤家“七十四师”来了，随着，部队得到命令：停止前进待命行动，指战员们立刻兴奋起来。磨拳擦掌，准备吃“七十四师”雪涟水战败之辱。有人高兴得还编起打七十四师的歌子来。
    部队停了不久，又奉命继续前进；而且是急行军，指战员们更高兴了，以为一定是去打七十四师。可是愈走，离炮声愈远，原来方向不对，炮声在东南，部队却向西南方向前进，并且，从第二天起，改夜行军为白天行军，在夜行军中从不用的军号也吹起来了。很显然，七十四师，是打不成了，既然仗打不成，情况又不紧张，可是不管风雨多大，部队照常每天八十里，战士们搞不通，连长不高兴，团长也不舒服，……几天以后，当他们奉命返回头来以急行军去消灭七十四师，他们才恍然大悟，原来上级叫他们向西南走，改夜行军为日行军是为了调七十四师上孟良崮。这是多么引人入胜的描写啊，这是多么有力的富有生活气息的描写啊！
    战争是千变万化的，把敌人调到预定地点之后，并不等于消灭了，敌人不是傻子，他们有指挥有布置，他们有良好的装备，他们可以用军法逼着士兵冲杀。尽管如此，但是反动军队的阶级本质注定了他们要灭亡的。这里，作品的成功之处，就在于作者对两大著名战役的敌军司令官作了细微刻划，不仅活绘出李仙洲那种优柔寡断、老奸巨滑的性格，张灵甫那种骄傲自满、刚愎自用的性格，而且通过对他们的描写把敌人那种腐朽残暴，各成派系，互不支援，总想牺牲异己，保存个人实力的反动军队的本质生动地展现出来，这当中，由于作者赋予了人物以生命力，由于作者写出了敌人如何由狂妄的进攻，到挣扎反扑，想摆脱被歼命运，但由于士兵厌战，人民不支持等等，而终于覆灭这一真实的斗争过程，所以读来非常令人信服。
    在描写我军取得战役胜利的过程中，同样的，作者不仅对军长沈振新，团长刘胜，连长石东根，班长秦守本等很多人物作了细微刻划，生动地描绘出他们各自不同的性格面貌，和对战争高度负责的阶级品质，并通过他们，突出地表现了我军那种高度的革命英雄主义，真实地反映了当时我军的斗争生活面貌。
    在这篇文章里，不可能对所有主要人物都评述一下，只要谈谈对团长刘胜这个人物的刻划，就足以说明问题了。
    涟水战役吃了败仗之后，团长刘胜和全军所有的指战员一样，窝了口大气，他总觉得，非歼灭了蒋军七十四师，才算争回了部队的荣誉，因之消灭七十四师，是他的（也是全军每个人的）心腹大事，但仅这一点，并不能给刘胜以生命力。刘胜热爱部队，珍视部队的荣誉胜于自己的生命，这些，仅是当时历史生活中我军每个人所共有的一种共同性格而已。此外他——刘胜还有自己的个性：纯朴、爽直是他的优点，性子太刚，脾气急躁又是他的缺点。缺点的克服——性格的成长，是与人物所处的生活时代分不开的，换句话说，在描写人物的成长过程中，如何反映当时的斗争生活，对于作家来说，是一个重要的课题。这个课题解决不好，人物就站立不住，作品也不会成功。
    吴强同志完全懂得这一点，并且牢牢地掌握了这一点。
    涟水战役败退下来，刘胜的团损伤很大，装备自然也很不好，这时传来了兄弟部队在峄枣战役大捷的消息。相形之下，他和别人一样，当然受刺激。当时，政治主任潘文藩曾用羡慕的口气向他说道：“这一仗打得好呀，缴了大炮小炮好几百门！”他却冷笑地说：“眼红吗？那是人家的本事”。潘文藩并不介意，进一步对刘胜说：“能不能向上面要求一下，拨几门炮给我们”。刘胜反感地说：“好意思吗？要脸不要？”当潘再进一步说服他：“那有什么关系，都是一个大家庭里……”时，他把香烟一抛，忿忿地说：“我不是作叫花子的？就是苦得没有饭吃，我也不去讨饭。”
    刘胜不想要炮吗？想要，但他，一来部队打了败仗在气头上，二来性子太刚，认为，有本事应自己搞炮。同时，他还有点对知识分子出身的政委和主任不太欢喜，这时候，他还不成熟，遇事好冲动，使性子，不考虑对方是好意还是坏意，也不管对方是否受得了。在莱芜战役歼灭李仙洲时，部队攻不上去，他火一来，就要硬拼。歼灭了李仙洲之后，为了调动敌七十四师，部队在沂蒙山区转圈子时，军长曾命令他这个团插到鲁西南沙河以西打伏击时，他因为不了解上级意图，他认为别的团去参加战斗，打七十四师去了，和中下级干部一样讲怪话发牢骚，甚至说什么“为什么不叫我们打七十四师，我们这个团不是亲生的？”可是，他却是个纯厚的人，他不论对谁，从不计较什么，有什么不高兴，发作之后也就完了，别人顶撞了他，他也从不记人。当他发现自己干错什么事或说错什么话，也心悦诚服地接受批评，并力求改进。而每受到一次批评，他也就更成熟一步。最后，在打上孟良崮活捉张灵甫的战斗中，他已经被磨炼得完全成熟了。张灵甫据险顽抗，他的部队受到损伤很大，但这时，他已能控制自己不再使性子硬拼了，而是用脑子使智慧去克服困难打上了山峰。但就在打上山峰的当儿，他受了重伤，死前还下命令说：“把队伍整理一下，攻到孟良崮山顶上去，捉住张灵甫带给我看看……”
    我军的高度的革命英雄主义和当时艰苦奋战的生活面貌，通过刘胜这个人物和许多别的人物，生动地真实地反映出来了。
    小说除了写战斗之外，还写到战时的后方生活，人民的支援，以及在战争生活中，军长、参谋、战士等几个主要人物的家庭生活和恋爱生活，这些都各有千秋，这篇短文里就不能一一论述了。当然也应当承认，这部小说，在语言的锻炼上，在某些生活细节的描写上，还有些粗糙之处，但小疵不能掩大德，因之，我愿向读者推荐这部小说。
