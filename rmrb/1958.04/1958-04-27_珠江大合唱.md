    "Pearl River Chorus"
    Writers and musicians in Guangzhou have learned from each other and cooperated to create the "Pearl River Chorus," which sings the praises of the people's revolutionary struggles in Guangdong over the past century.

    The "Pearl River Chorus" includes nine pieces such as the Overture, the Sanyuanli Battle Song, the Guangzhou Uprising March, and Ode to the Pearl River. Through the joint collaboration of writers and musicians, this large-scale ode expressing Guangdong's revolutionary history was completed in about seventeen days.

    The "Pearl River Chorus" is now being rehearsed by the Guangzhou Orchestra and the Guangzhou Amateur Chorus, with a total of more than 300 people, in preparation for singing to the people on both sides of the Pearl River on the "May Day" holiday.

    “珠江大合唱”
    广州市作家和音乐家互相学习共同合作，已创作出歌颂广东百多年来人民革命斗争的“珠江大合唱”。
    “珠江大合唱”包括序曲、三元里战歌、广州起义进行曲、珠江颂等九个曲子，经过作家和音乐家共同协作，以十七天左右的时间把这个表现广东革命历史的大型颂歌创作完毕。
    现在“珠江大合唱”已经由广州乐团和广州市业余合唱团共三百多人练唱，准备在“五一”节给珠江两岸人民歌唱。
