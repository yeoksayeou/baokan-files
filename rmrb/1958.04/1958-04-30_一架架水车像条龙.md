    Mountains upon mountains, rivers upon rivers, waterwheels like dragons wagging their tails. Pairs of hands crank the waterwheels, wave after wave of silver water splashes fly. Field upon field of rice seedlings like jadeite, face upon face shining with radiance. Ditch upon ditch of dry fields filled with water, time after time, the Dragon King's beard blows. Field upon field of rice seedlings strong and plump, plot upon plot of crops truly beautiful!

    一架架水车像条龙
    燕翼　光兰一座座山来一河河水，一架架水车像龙摆尾。一双双手儿摇水车，一股股银水浪花飞。一块块秧田似翡翠，一张张脸儿放光辉。一沟沟干田灌满水，一回回龙王胡子吹。一田田秧子壮又肥，一块块庄稼真正美！
