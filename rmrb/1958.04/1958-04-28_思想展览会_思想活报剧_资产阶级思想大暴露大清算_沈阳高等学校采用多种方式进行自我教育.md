Ideological Exhibition, Ideological Living Newspaper
Thorough Exposure and Liquidation of Bourgeois Ideology
Shenyang Higher Education Institutions Adopt Various Methods for Self-Education

(Reported by our newspaper) A mass self-education movement has rapidly formed in ten higher education institutions in Shenyang City. The broad masses of teachers and students are eagerly confessing their thoughts to the Party, resolutely breaking with old ideologies, and determined to advance towards the goal of being both red and expert.

In this movement, several students from Shenyang Normal College felt that simply posting big-character posters was insufficient, so they created a new form: the ideological exhibition. This combined the exhibition of physical objects with personal accounts to examine bourgeois ideology. Teachers and students at the Northeast Fine Arts College further developed this form into ideological living newspapers, writing, directing, and performing themselves to expose and criticize their own bourgeois ideas. As of March 25th, schools had posted more than 570,000 big-character posters, held more than 500 ideological exhibitions, and performed 97 ideological living newspapers. In addition, schools held countless large and small heart-to-heart meetings, and used free forums, "watermelon gardens," and other forms to expose and criticize bourgeois ideas. The vast majority of teachers and students in each school have consciously and actively engaged in the self-education movement.

In this movement, the broad masses of teachers and students proactively exposed a large amount of bourgeois ideology, mainly: extravagance and waste in running schools, the pompous and extravagant style of young masters, the bourgeois educational thought of teaching divorced from politics, reality, and production, the seriously irresponsible phenomenon of teachers only managing teaching and not learning, teaching books but not teaching people, as well as the neglect of politics, only expert but not red, individualistic fame and profit-seeking views, and the decadent lifestyle of the bourgeoisie among teachers and students, and so on. In the process of self-exposure and self-education, a new atmosphere rapidly formed. Li Yanguang, a teacher at Shenyang Normal College, had previously been uninterested in politics, and even during the vigorous anti-Rightist struggle, sometimes he would not attend meetings, but would run off to study his specialty. This time, after examining his thinking, he resolved to be both red and expert. Professor Li Peilin, director of the pathology teaching and research section of Shenyang Medical College, used to be someone his colleagues dared not criticize. This time, everyone spoke freely, and many opinions were very sharp. Not only was he able to listen with an open mind, but he also made a self-examination. Zhao Dianbang, a teacher at the Northeast Fine Arts College, stood up and told the audience sadly at the end of the performance of "In the Teachers' Dormitory": "The role I played today was myself a few months ago. Because despicable individualism has penetrated my soul, I was used by rightists during the period of airing views." He expressed his determination to resolutely eliminate the thought of fame and gain and make himself a strong leftist. Teachers in the physical education teaching and research section of the Northeast University of Finance and Economics used to have a "six-don't-care" attitude in teaching (not caring about students' thoughts, not caring about the affairs of the group, not caring whether students can do it or not, not caring whether they pass or fail, not caring about their own problems, not caring about leadership criticism). This caused 33% of the students to fail physical education. They exposed it in the self-education movement and expressed their determination to correct it. The exposure of these problems in the movement has also educated the broad masses of teachers and students, and many people felt very heavy-hearted and resolved to bid farewell to old ideas and strive for both red and expert.

In the self-education movement, everyone treated each other with sincerity. After everyone confessed their thoughts to the Party, they all felt refreshed and full of energy. Many teachers have made improvements in their teaching, and they are preparing lessons more carefully and conscientiously. Many old problems that had been around for a long time have also been resolved this time. For example, Professors Wu Yousan and Zhang Jizhong of Shenyang Agricultural College were in the same teaching and research group, but they had long been dissatisfied with each other and were not united. The Party organization had done a lot of work, and the comrades in the teaching and research group had also tried their best to persuade them, but the problem had not been resolved. This time, after confessing their thoughts to each other, they shook hands and made peace. The two jointly issued a big-character poster, stating, "From now on, we will be of one heart and one mind, break down prejudices, and jointly serve socialist construction."

    思想展览会　思想活报剧
    资产阶级思想大暴露大清算
    沈阳高等学校采用多种方式进行自我教育
    本报讯　沈阳市十所高等学校迅速形成群众性的自我教育运动，广大师生纷纷向党交心，坚决和旧思想一刀两断，一心要向红透专深的目标前进。
    在这个运动中，沈阳师范学院有几名学生感到光贴大字报不能满足要求，于是创造思想展览会的新形式。即用实物展出和现身说法结合，检查资产阶级思想。东北美术专科学校的师生又将这种形式发展为思想活报剧，自编自导，自己表演，揭露和批判自己的资产阶级思想。到3月25日止，各校共贴了五十七万多张大字报，办了五百多个思想展览会，演出九十七个思想活报剧。此外，各校还开了无数的大小交心会，以及利用自由讲坛、西瓜园等多种形式，暴露和批判资产阶级思想。各校绝大多数师生都自觉地积极地投入自我教育运动中来了。
    在这个运动中，广大师生主动揭露了大量资产阶级思想，这主要是：办学上的铺张浪费、讲排场的大少爷作风，教学脱离政治、脱离实际、脱离生产的资产阶级办学思想，教学中管教不管学、教书不教人的严重不负责现象，以及师生中的忽视政治、只专不红、个人主义名利观点和资产阶级腐朽的生活方式等等。在自我暴露、自我教育当中，新的风气迅速形成。沈阳师范学院教师李燕光，过去一向不问政治，甚至在轰轰烈烈的反右派斗争中，有时也不参加会议，跑出去钻研业务，这回检查了思想，决心做到又红又专。沈阳医学院病理教研组主任李佩琳教授，组内教师过去不敢批评他，这回大家都畅所欲言，好些意见提的很尖锐，他不仅能虚心听取，并且作了自我检查。东北美术专科学校教师赵殿邦在演出“在教师宿舍”快结束时，站起来沉痛地向观众们说：“我今天演出的角色就是几个月前的自己，由于卑鄙的个人主义渗透了我的灵魂，在鸣放时曾被右派分子利用。”他表示要坚决清除名利思想，使自己成为坚强的左派。东北财经学院体育教研组教师过去在教学上存在六不管（不管学生思想，不管组里的事，学生会不会不管，及不及格不管，自己有毛病不管，领导批评不管）的现象，曾使33％的学生体育不及格，他们在自我教育运动中把它暴露出来，表示决心改正。运动中揭露出这些问题，又使广大师生受到了教育，好些人感到很沉痛，决心告别旧思想，力争红与专。
    在自我教育运动中，彼此赤诚相见，大家向党交心之后，都感到心情舒畅，浑身是劲。不少教师在教学上有了改进，备课都比较仔细、认真了。许多长了胡子的老问题，这回也得到了解决。如沈阳农学院吴友三、张际中两教授同在一个教研组，长期互不服气，不团结，党组织做过许多工作，教研组的同志也曾尽量劝解，但问题都没有解决。这回彼此交心之后，握手言欢。两人联名出大字报，表示“从此一心一德，破除成见，共同为社会主义建设服务”。
