Criticizing Right-leaning Conservatism, Abolishing Outdated Customs, Improving Case-handling Efficiency
Guangzhou Procuratorate's Rectification "Experimental Field" a Success

(Our newspaper Guangzhou dispatch) The Guangzhou Municipal People's Procuratorate has used the method of cultivating an "experimental field" to oppose right-leaning conservative thought and improve work efficiency.

After the upsurge of speaking out freely in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement swept through the Municipal Procuratorate, many instances of waste, especially right-leaning conservative thinking, old legal viewpoints, and unreasonable rules and regulations and cumbersome case-handling procedures, were exposed. These situations showed that there were many problems in procuratorial work that needed major rectification, major reform, and a great leap forward. However, there were different opinions and many debates about whether procuratorial work could make a leap forward, how much it could leap forward, and how to leap forward. Some comrades believed that "procuratorial work can also have a socialist great leap forward like other departments." However, some comrades believed, "The task of the procuratorial organs is to handle cases, and handling cases requires looking at so many materials and going through so many legal procedures. How can there be a leap forward?" A few comrades simply said, "The procuratorial organs just review case files and handle cases. What's there to leap forward?" The masses discussed a lot, the backbone lacked confidence, and the leadership also had no bottom line.

In the debate, the comrades who believed that a great leap forward was possible calculated three accounts regarding case handling in the prosecution work: on the premise of ensuring the quality of case handling, the first half of 1957 was a period of business construction for the Procuratorate. During this period, each person handled an average of 1.2 prosecution cases per month; the second half of 1957 was in the midst of the rectification, anti-rightist, and historical issue debates, and work was very busy, but each person could handle an average of 6.5 cases per month; in January and February of this year, the organization was streamlined and cadres were sent to lower levels, but the average case handling per person per month increased to eight to nine cases. These three accounts showed that the work potential was very large. As long as there was great drive, great dedication, and good improvement of work methods, case-handling efficiency could be greatly improved, cases could be handled better, and more cases could be handled. However, some comrades still did not understand and held skeptical attitudes.

In order to establish the case-handling leap forward on a reliable basis, the rectification leading group of the Procuratorate decided to respond to the call of the Central Government to cultivate "experimental fields," establish a rectification "experimental field," and grasp the main rectification link in procuratorial business – review and prosecution work – to study how to break down outdated customs, eliminate rules and regulations that constrained work, improve case-handling methods, and, on the premise of ensuring quality, shorten case-handling time and improve work efficiency. Under the ideological guidance of going all out, aiming high, breaking out of frameworks, abandoning red tape, and breaking down outdated customs, the "experimental field" was "cultivated" by a section chief leading two procurators, starting on March 8 and ending on the 14th. In the seven days, they successively experimented with approving ten arrests, prosecuting twenty cases, and appearing in court once for four cases. The experimental results showed an unprecedented improvement in case-handling efficiency. What originally took thirty hours to complete for review and approval of arrests could now be concluded in less than one hour; what originally took several weeks to complete for review of prosecution could now be reviewed in two hours and twenty-two minutes. At the same time, it was done by meticulous examination of each case, with necessary procedures completed, without carelessness or sloppiness, accurately and quickly, and the quality met the requirements. Some cases have been tried by the court and have withstood the test of practice.

The "experimental field" of the Municipal Procuratorate found the main obstacles to the low efficiency of procuratorial work in the past. In addition to the right-leaning conservatism and officialism and inertia existing among the cadres, the complexity and cumbersomeness of case-handling procedures and countless outdated customs, rules and regulations, restricted the enthusiasm of cadres. In the past, this Procuratorate required twenty-seven procedures from review and approval of arrests and prosecution to case closure. In addition to some procedures necessary for actual work, many were repetitive and superfluous outdated customs and rules and regulations that restricted hands and feet, and some were even wrong and outdated customs left over from old legal viewpoints. Therefore, in the process of cultivating the "experimental field," in addition to relying on the masses to go all out, revolutionary measures were also taken in the work procedures, abolishing some unnecessary or dispensable procedures. At the same time, some backward work methods were correspondingly improved and innovated, thus shortening the case-handling time and greatly improving work efficiency.

Recently, this Procuratorate used fewer people and solved the long-standing problem of backlog of cases in just over ten days.

### 批判右倾保守　废除陈规陋习　提高办案效率  广州检察院搞整改“试验田”成功

    批判右倾保守　废除陈规陋习　提高办案效率
    广州检察院搞整改“试验田”成功
    本报广州电　广州市人民检察院用种“试验田”的办法，反掉了右倾保守思想，提高了工作效率。
    当反浪费反保守运动的鸣放热潮在市检察院掀起以后，许多浪费现象，特别是右倾保守思想，旧法观点，以及不合理的规章制度和烦琐的办案程序都被揭露出来了。这些情况说明检察工作中存在着不少问题，需要大整大改大跃进。但是对检察工作能否跃进，跃进多少，如何跃进，大家看法不一，争论很多。有些同志认为“检察工作也可以像其他部门一样，来个社会主义的大跃进”。但是一部分同志却认为“检察机关的任务就是办案，办案就得看这么多材料，办这么多法律手续，那能跃进？”少数同志则干脆说：“检察机关就是看卷办案，有什么好跃进？”群众议论纷纭，骨干没有信心，领导心中也无底。
    在争论中，认为可以大跃进的同志就办理起诉工作方面的案件算了三笔账：在保证办案质量的前提下，1957年上半年检察院是业务建设时期，这时期平均每人每月办理起诉案一点二件；1957年下半年处在整风、反右派和历史问题大辩论的运动中，工作很忙，但每人每月平均可办六点五件；今年1、2月，机构精简了，干部下放了，然而每人每月平均办案却提高到八至九件。这三笔账说明工作潜力是很大的，只要干劲大，钻劲大，好好改善工作方法，办案效率还可以大大提高，案子还可以办得更好，可以办得更多。可是，有些同志的思想仍然不通，抱着怀疑的态度。
    为了使办案跃进建立在可靠的基础上，该院整风领导小组决定响应中央提出种“试验田”的号召，建立整改“试验田”，抓住检察业务中的主要整改环节——审查起诉工作，研究如何打破陈规陋习，扫除束缚工作的清规戒律，改进办案方法，在保证质量的前提下，缩短办案的时间，提高工作效率。“试验田”就在鼓足革命干劲，力争上游，跳出框框，抛弃条条，打破陈规的思想指导下，由一位处长带领两名检察员于3月8日开始“耕耘”，至14日告一段落。在七天中先后试验了批捕十件，起诉二十件，出庭一次四件。试验结果，办案效率有着空前的提高，原来审查批捕需三十小时才能完成的，现在不到一小时就可做出结论；原来审查起诉需经几个星期才能结束的，现在两小时二十二分钟就能审查完毕。同时做到了逐件细致检验，必要的手续完备，不马虎、不草率，又准、又快，质量上合乎要求。一些案件已由法院开庭审判，经受了实践的考验。
    市检察院的“试验田”摸到了检察工作过去效率不高的主要障碍，除了在干部中存在着的右倾保守和官气、暮气外，还由于办案程序的复杂烦琐以及无数陈规陋习、清规戒律，束缚了干部工作的积极性。过去，这个院由审查批捕、起诉到结案共需经过二十七道程序，除有些实际工作所必需的外，不少是重复多余的陈规陋习和束缚手脚的清规戒律，有些甚至是错误的，是旧法观点留下来的陈规。所以，种“试验田”的过程中，除依靠群众鼓足革命干劲外，还在工作程序上，采取了革命的措施，废除了一些不必要的或可要可不要的程序。与此同时，对一些落后的工作方法，相应的改进和革新，因此缩短了办案时间，工作效率大大地提高。
    这个院最近用较少的人，在短短的十多天中，就解决了长期以来未能解决的积案问题。
