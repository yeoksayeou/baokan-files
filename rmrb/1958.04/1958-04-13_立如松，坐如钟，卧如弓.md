    Stand Like a Pine, Sit Like a Bell, Lie Like a Bow
　　Situ Yi
    Adults often teach children, "Stand with a proper stance, sit with a proper posture." This "proper" refers to the correct posture.
    The ancients always attached great importance to human body postures. The "Xiangdang" chapter of the "Analects" records that Confucius "did not lie like a corpse, nor was he overly formal in daily life," meaning, "When lying down, don't be as stiff as a corpse, and in daily life, don't be as stiff and restrained as when receiving guests."
    The basic postures of the human body can be divided into three types: standing, sitting, and lying. There is a folk saying: "Stand like a pine, sit like a bell, lie like a bow." This proverb is not only simple, concise, and graphic, but also, from the perspective of modern health science, can be said to be completely correct.
    The "pine" in "stand like a pine" does not, of course, refer to the Welcoming Pine of Huangshan or the Grand Master Pine of Taishan. Although those pine trees are rich in artistic flavor and are quaint and lovely, it would be deformed if a person stood in that shape. The "pine" in "stand like a pine" refers to the common red pine and white pine. These pine trees have straight and upright trunks, and a person's standing posture should be like that of these pine trees.
    The "bell" in "sit like a bell" is not the modern clock, but refers to the "morning bell and evening drum" bells in the bell and drum towers or temples of the past. This kind of bell looks very upright from any angle, unbiased, and gives a sense of stability. A person's sitting posture should be like this kind of bell.
    "Lie like a bow" means adopting a side-lying position, and raising and slightly bending both legs, so that the whole body looks like the shape of a bow. Here, a sentence needs to be added: When adopting a side-lying position, it is best to lean to the right as much as possible.
    Why should we pay attention to correct posture? The ancients mostly started from appearance. Indeed, if a person stands straight and sits upright, it can give people an impression of being heroic and full of vitality. However, posture has a greater relationship with health. Maintaining an upright posture when standing and sitting, without bending forward or leaning back, or tilting left or right, can expand the volume of the chest cavity, creating good conditions for breathing and blood circulation. At the same time, it can also reduce the pressure on the abdominal organs and make people feel less tired. For young children, correct posture is even more important. Because children's bones contain more collagen and are easily deformed, incorrect sitting and standing can easily cause developmental defects such as scoliosis, hunchback, and uneven shoulders.
    The reason for adopting a right-side lying position with a slight bend is mainly because the heart and stomach are both on the left side of the body, and lying on the right side can reduce the pressure on these two organs.
    Human body posture also has a great impact on labor and learning efficiency, politeness, and the relationship between living in a group and getting along with others. I won’t go into detail here.

### 立如松，坐如钟，卧如弓

    立如松，坐如钟，卧如弓
　　司徒益
    大人们常教导孩子说：“站要有个站相，坐要有个坐相。”这“相”，就是姿势。
    古人对于人体姿势，一向很重视。论语一书乡党章里就曾记载孔子是“寝不尸，居不容”的，就是说：“躺着的时候，不要像死尸似的那样直挺挺地，日常生活中，也不要像接待宾客那样拘谨呆板。”
    人体的基本姿势，可以分为立、坐、卧三种。民间有三句谚语：“立如松，坐如钟，卧如弓。”这谚语不仅简单、扼要、形象化，而且从现代卫生科学观点看来，可以说也完全正确。
    “立如松”的松，当然不是指黄山的迎客松或泰山的五大夫松。那些松树虽然富于画意，奇古可爱，但人若站立成那样形态，可就畸形了。“立如松”的松，是指常见的红松白松。这类松树树干挺拔端直，人站立的姿势，应当像这类松树那样。
    “坐如钟”的钟，不是现代的时钟，是指过去各地钟鼓楼上或寺庙里的“暮鼓晨钟”的钟。这种钟从任何角度看来都非常端正，不偏不倚，而且给人一种稳重的感觉。人坐着的姿势就应当像这种钟那样。
    “卧如弓”，是叫人采取侧面躺的体位，而且两腿上引微屈，使整个身体好像一张弓的形态。这里需要补充一句：采取侧卧姿势，最好尽可能偏向右侧。
    为什么要注意姿势的正确呢？古人多半是从仪表出发的。的确，一个人如果立得直、坐得正，就能给人一种气概轩昂、生气勃勃的印象。但是，姿势和健康关系更大。立和坐的姿势，能经常保持正直，不前屈后仰、左偏右斜，就可以使胸腔的容积扩大，给呼吸和血液循环造成良好的条件，同时还可以减少对于腹腔内脏的压迫，并且使人不容易感觉疲劳。对于少年儿童来说，端正的姿势更加重要。因为儿童骨胳里胶质多容易变形，坐立不正，很容易造成脊柱弯曲倾斜、驼背、左右肩不平等等发育上的缺陷。
    卧的姿势所以采取向右侧躺而且微屈的方式，主要是因为心脏和胃都生在身体的左侧，躺向右侧就可以减少对这两个器官的压迫。
    人体姿势，对于劳动和学习的效率，对于礼貌，对于过集体生活与人相处的关系，也都很有影响，这里就不多谈了。
