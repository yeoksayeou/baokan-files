    Extracting Raw Materials from the Sea
    Near Shuanggang Village, Hengsha Township, in the suburbs of Guangzhou, a sea fertilizer plant is under construction, scheduled to go into production in May.
    This fertilizer plant mainly extracts aquatic products such as jellyfish, milkfish, and miscellaneous fish from the sea to make fertilizer. The annual output of sea fertilizer is more than 57.7 million jin, equivalent to more than 4 million jin of ammonium sulfate, which can be used to fertilize 112,500 mu of land.

    向海中取原料
    广州郊区横沙乡双岗村附近，正在兴建一座海肥厂，计划在5月间即可投入生产。
    这个肥厂主要向海中捞取水母、奶鱼及杂鱼等水产品来制成肥料。年产海肥五千七百多万斤，相当于硫酸铵四百多万斤，可供十一万二千五百亩田施肥。
