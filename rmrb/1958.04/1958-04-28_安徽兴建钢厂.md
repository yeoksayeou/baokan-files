	Anhui Builds Steel Plant
	The main building of Anhui Province's first small steel plant began construction on the 24th. After the completion of the first phase of this steel plant, it will be able to produce 100,000 tons of steel ingots and various types of steel annually.
	The characteristic of the steel plant construction in Anhui Province is low investment and quick results. It can be partially completed and put into production in just six months, and fully put into production in about a year. The investment in building the plant can be fully recovered in less than a year. After this plant is put into production, the situation in Anhui Province, which has long relied on steel supply from other places, can be changed.
	Many auxiliary projects of the Anhui Province steel plant started construction one after another as early as the second half of last year.

    安徽兴建钢厂
    安徽省第一座小型钢厂的主厂房在24日动工兴建。这个钢厂的第一期工程完工后，每年可以生产十万吨钢锭和各种钢材。
    安徽省钢厂建设的特点是投资少、收效快。它只要六个月就可以部分建成投入生产，一年左右可以全部投入生产，建厂的投资不要一年就可以全部收回。这个厂投入生产后，安徽省长期以来靠外地供应钢材的局面就可以得到改变。
    安徽省钢厂的许多辅助工程，早在去年下半年就先后开工建设。
