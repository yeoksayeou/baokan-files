    A Factory Flows Over a Thousand Miles
    Xinjiang Finds a New Path for Developing Local Industry
    Urumqi, April 15th (this newspaper) – The first batch of mobile factories in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has opened up a new path for developing local industry in this vast and sparsely populated area.
    This batch of mobile factories was started on a trial basis by the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region from 1955. To date, there are nine mobile factories that have been put into production or are about to be put into production, including rice mills, cotton gins, cottonseed hullers, fertilizer plants, and ramie processing plants.
    Mobile factories have simple equipment, require little investment, and produce quick results. A mobile rice mill that produces 36 to 40 tons of rice per day in two shifts only requires one-third of the investment of a fixed rice mill with the same capacity because it does not require basic construction such as warehouses and factory buildings. The machinery, equipment, personnel, tents, and fuel oil of this type of mobile rice mill are all loaded onto two Liberation brand trucks, which can move to places five or six hundred kilometers away or even further for processing. After arriving at the destination, it only takes six hours to install and put into production, which is very suitable for the current needs of Xinjiang, which is vast and sparsely populated with a decentralized economy.
    The biggest advantage of mobile factories is that they can save a lot of transportation capacity and transportation costs. The two mobile rice mills in the Urumqi reclamation area have processed 16,700 tons of rice in the past three years, saving more than 1.3 million ton-kilometers of round-trip transportation compared to processing in fixed rice mills with an average transportation distance of 50 kilometers. This is equivalent to the transportation volume of 200 Liberation brand trucks from Lanzhou to Urumqi once, which is equivalent to transportation costs of about 380,000 yuan.
    Mobile factories also ensure the full utilization of by-products and small resources. The by-products processed in rural areas, such as rice husks, cottonseed husks, and rice bran, also partially solve the local fuel and feed problems. However, fixed factories often cannot utilize these by-products and also consume transportation capacity to transport these things away. At the beginning of spring plowing this year, a certain unit in the Urumqi reclamation area also used small resources that were not enough to establish a small-scale fertilizer plant to establish a mobile fertilizer plant with a daily output of eight tons of nitrogen fertilizer, which was supplied to the reclamation area farms nearby.

    一个工厂流动一千多里
    新疆找到了发展地方工业的新道路
    本报乌鲁木齐15日电　新疆维吾尔自治区出现的第一批流动工厂，给地广人稀的地区发展地方工业开辟了一条新道路。
    这批流动工厂是新疆军区生产建设兵团从1955年开始陆续试办的。到目前为止，已经投入生产和即将投入生产的共有碾米、轧花、棉籽剥壳、化肥和罗布麻加工等九个流动工厂。
    流动工厂设备简单，投资少，收效快。一个两班生产日产三十六到四十吨大米的流动碾米厂，由于不需要进行仓库、厂房等基本建设，投资只等于同样能力的固定碾米厂的三分之一。这种流动碾米厂的机器设备、人员、帐篷和燃料油全部装在二辆解放牌汽车上，可以流动到五、六百公里甚至更远的地方去加工，在到达目的地后，只需要六小时就可安装好投入生产，非常适合新疆目前地广人稀、经济分散的需要。
    流动工厂最大的优点是能节省大量的运输力和运输费用。乌鲁木齐垦区的两个流动碾米厂三年来加工的一万六千七百吨稻谷，比送往平均按五十公里运距计算的固定碾米厂加工就节省了往返运输量一百三十多万吨公里，等于二百辆解放牌汽车从兰州到乌鲁木齐的一次运输量，折合运输费用约三十八万元。
    流动工厂还保证了副产品和小资源的充分利用，在农村加工的副产品稻壳、棉籽壳、米糠等，还部分地解决了当地燃料和饲料问题，而固定工厂对这些副产品往往不能利用，并且还要消耗运输力把这些东西运走。乌鲁木齐垦区某部今年春耕开始时，还利用不够建立小规模化肥厂的小资源建立了一个日产八吨氮肥的流动化肥厂，就近供应给垦区农场。　（王安）
