    Grasp Agriculture and Also Grasp Sidelines
    Hebei Actively Develops Sidelines to Support Agricultural Leap Forward
    (Our dispatch) Hebei Province, while launching a great leap forward in agricultural production, many agricultural cooperatives are also actively engaged in sideline production activities. According to statistics from fifty-six counties in four special districts, sideline income in January and February reached more than 20.05 million yuan, with an average of more than 20 yuan distributed to each member participating in these activities.
    Agricultural cooperatives in five counties of the Cangxian Special District have all drawn a portion of their sideline income to purchase means of production to support agricultural production. They have collectively purchased more than 15,000 pieces of waterwheels and farm tools, more than 840 head of livestock, 1.19 million jin of chemical fertilizer and manure, and 155 pigs and sheep, etc. The Yuanmao Agricultural Cooperative in Xingbieying Township, Hejian County, had a sideline income of more than 6,000 yuan in January and February, from which 2,100 yuan was drawn for agricultural investment. A few members of the Xiliuzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in this county had financial difficulties. Thanks to attention paid to sideline production, not only were these members quickly helped to overcome their difficulties, but also twenty waterwheels, three head of livestock, and fifty pigs were purchased.
    In order to enable agricultural and sideline production to support each other and leap forward simultaneously, various localities, on the premise of prioritizing the development of grain production, have formulated comprehensive development plans and long-term plans for a variety of sideline productions. The Chengde Special District has designated a commissioner to be responsible for sideline activities and has adopted the method of "small-scale engagement during busy farming seasons and large-scale engagement during slack farming seasons."
    Furthermore, the CPC Baoding Special District Committee of Hebei Province recently strengthened its leadership over rural sideline production, which quickly led to new developments in sideline production. Currently, the sideline production projects carried out in this special district include more than twenty categories and over one hundred varieties, such as opening flour mills, ginning cotton, oil pressing, weaving, brick burning, saltpeter boiling, making local paper, and fishing. By the end of March, the number of people engaged in sideline production activities in the entire special district reached 300,000, an increase of more than 70,000 compared to the end of February. In mid- to late March, the average daily income from sideline production reached more than 146,000 yuan, an increase of nearly half compared to February.
    Since the beginning of spring, leaders in some areas of this special district had underestimated the fact that the masses' past family assets were empty. They once relaxed their leadership over sideline production work, and some of the masses experienced difficulties in their lives. To this end, the CPC Baoding Prefectural Committee emphasized the importance of doing a good job in sideline production for supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production and solving the people's livelihood difficulties, and arranged to strengthen the leadership of sideline production work. Now, party committees at all levels throughout the district have designated a secretary to be responsible for leadership, a member to be in charge of daily work, and organized corresponding forces to specifically manage sideline production, people's livelihood, food supply, and economic support, etc.; adhering to the principle of "maintaining the livelihood of the masses and supporting the great leap forward in agriculture," they help agricultural cooperatives extract a certain amount of labor and open up avenues for sideline production.

    抓农业也抓副业
    河北积极发展副业支持农业跃进
    本报讯　河北省在掀起农业生产大跃进运动的同时，许多农业社也积极开展副业生产活动。据四个专区五十六个县的统计，1、2月份的副业收入即达二千零五十多万元，平均每个参加这一活动的社员可以分得二十元以上。
    沧县专区五个县的各农业社，都从副业收入中抽出一部分资金购买生产资料支援农业生产。他们共买回水车、农具一万五千多件，牲口八百四十多头，化学肥料和大粪一百一十九万斤，猪、羊一百五十五只等。河间县行别营乡远茂农业社1、2月份的副业收入达六千多元，从中抽出二千一百元作了农业投资。这个县的西刘庄农业社少数社员生活有困难，由于注意开展了副业生产，不但很快地帮助这些社员解决了困难，而且还购买了二十辆水车、三头牲口和五十只猪。
    为了使农业和副业生产能够互相支持，同时跃进，各地在优先发展粮食生产的前提下，制订出全面发展多种多样的副业生产计划和远景规划。承德专区确定一名专员负责管副业，并采取了“农忙小搞，农闲大搞”的办法。
    又讯　中共河北省保定专区各级党委最近加强对于农村副业生产工作的领导，很快就使副业生产有了新的发展。现在，这个专区开展的副业生产项目计有开粉房、轧花、打油、编织、烧砖、熬硝、造土纸、捕鱼等二十多类共一百多种。到3月底，全专区投入副业生产活动的人数达到三十万，比2月底增加七万多人。3月中、下旬，副业生产平均日收入达到十四万六千多元，比2月份增加近半。
    入春以来，这个专区有些地方领导上对群众过去家底空的情况估计不足，曾一度放松了对副业生产工作的领导，部分群众在生活上发生了困难。为此，中共保定地委强调了搞好副业生产对于支持农业生产大跃进和解决群众生活困难的重要性，布置了要加强领导副业生产工作。现在，全区各级党委已经确定由一名书记负责领导，一名委员掌握日常工作，并组织相应的力量专门管理副业生产、群众生活、粮食供应、经济支持等工作；本着“维持群众生活、支持农业大跃进”的原则，帮助农业社抽出一定的劳力，开辟副业生产门路。　	（邓子常）
