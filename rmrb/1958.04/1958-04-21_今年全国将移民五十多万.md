More Than 500,000 People Will Be Migrated Nationally This Year

(Our newspaper dispatch) It is estimated that more than 530,000 people will be migrated across the country this year. Among them, more than 230,000 people will be long-distance migrants between provinces, mostly from Shandong and Henan provinces to Heilongjiang and Gansu provinces. Intra-provincial migration is about 300,000 people, mostly in Hebei, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi and other provinces. In addition, Heilongjiang, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have also decided to resettle more than 140,000 family members of migrants from the past two years.

This year, most of the migrants will be dispersed and resettled in agricultural production cooperatives and new immigrant villages with more land, insufficient labor, and annual wasteland cultivation. Only a small number of migrants will engage in reclamation, and it is estimated that about one million mu of land will be reclaimed nationwide. Most of the intra-provincial migration tasks are "facing the mountainous areas," and some are to supplement the lack of labor in sparsely populated areas.

    今年全国将移民五十多万
    本报讯　今年全国将移民五十三万多人。其中，省与省之间的远距离移民二十三万多人，大部是由山东、河南两省移往黑龙江省、甘肃省的。省内移民约三十万人，多在河北、福建、广东、江西等省。此外，黑龙江、甘肃、青海两省及内蒙古自治区，还决定安置过去两年的移民家属十四万余人。
    今年移民将绝大部分分散安置在土地多、劳力不足、年年撩荒耕地的农业生产合作社和移民新村内。只有少数移民进行垦荒，估计全国约垦荒一百万亩左右。省内的移民任务大多是“面向山区”，也有一部分是补充地广人稀地区的劳力不足的。
