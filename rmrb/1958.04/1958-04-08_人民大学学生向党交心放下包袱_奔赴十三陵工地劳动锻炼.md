    Renmin University Students Confide in the Party and Drop Their Burdens
    Heading to the Ming Tombs Construction Site for Labor Training
    (Our Newspaper News) "Confide in the Party, confide in the people, confide in the motherland!" This is the oath of the students of Renmin University of China, determined to revolutionize themselves. Now, after confiding in the Party, they have joyfully headed to the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site to engage in voluntary labor.
    This extensive confession movement among the students has brought them another step closer to the path of being both Red and expert. On March 30th, the Party Committee of the university held a meeting of Party member representatives. The Party Committee Secretary, Hu Xikui, called on all Party members at the meeting to consciously carry out ideological revolution, guide the masses forward, and create a high tide of ideological revolution. Afterwards, all the students warmly responded to the Party Committee's call, writing big-character posters and small-character posters day and night. They turned their innermost thoughts over to the Party through confession letters, confession collections, confession platforms, and written confession discussions. Various departments also held large or small confession meetings. The History Department held a Confession to the Party Exhibition. This exhibition was organized and explained by the masses, and was a good way to promote mutual confession among the masses, playing a great educational role for everyone. The Statistics Department used a combination of small and large meetings, small and large-character posters, and challenges and competitions between classes, Party branches, teachers and students, teachers with each other, and students with each other, so that a mass confession to the Party upsurge appeared in a short period of time. Students boldly exposed their thoughts and unloaded their "burdens." In the process of confession, many students examined the issue of for whom they were studying and for whom they were serving, fiercely burning all kinds of bourgeois individualism. Some of them were not at ease with their professional studies and wanted to become writers "like Du Fu and Bai Juyi, to be remembered by later generations," or write a book to "leave a lasting legacy." Some even wanted to become "famous figures commemorated by the whole world in a hundred years." Zhu Wenhua, a student in the Finance Department, although only twenty years old, wanted to become famous and established, and since entering school, he did not love his major, did not ask about politics, and buried himself in creation all day long. A student in the Philosophy Department revealed his bourgeois outlook on life in his confession, wanting to live in a Western-style house, ride in a car, and find a beautiful wife in the future, without thinking about studying for the people. Some students also examined their political stand. Chen Shaolin, a law student, examined himself for his unstable stance in the rectification movement, and for having a romantic relationship with a female rightist during the anti-rightist struggle. This time he examined himself, saying: "This is recognizing the enemy as a friend, exchanging the interests of the proletariat for despicable bourgeois love."
    After confiding in the Party, the students unloaded their burdens, packed their luggage, and went to the Ming Tombs construction site in the suburbs of Beijing with joy to engage in voluntary labor, striving to win another victory in labor and further train themselves.

    人民大学学生向党交心放下包袱
    奔赴十三陵工地劳动锻炼
    本报讯　“向党交心、向人民交心、向祖国交心”这是中国人民大学学生决心自我革命的誓言，现在他们在向党交心后，已心情愉快地奔向十三陵水库工地，进行义务劳动。
    这次学生们普遍深入进行的交心运动，使他们向又红又专的大道又跃进一步。3月30日，该校党委召开了党员代表会议，党委书记胡锡奎在会上号召全体党员自觉地进行思想革命，引导群众前进，掀起思想革命的高潮。会后，全体学生热烈响应党委号召，通宵达旦地写大字报、小字报，他们通过交心书、交心集、交心台、交心笔谈会，把心里话交给党。各系还召开了大型或小型交心会，历史系举办了向党交心展览会。这个展览会是由群众举办、群众讲解，是推动群众互相交心的一种好形式，对大家起了很大教育作用。统计系利用小会和大会结合、小字报和大字报结合，班与班、党支部与党支部、教员与同学、教员相互之间和同学之间互相挑战竞赛等方式，使一个群众性的向党交心的高潮在短期内出现了，同学们大胆暴露思想，卸下“包袱”。在交心中许多同学检查了为谁学习为谁服务的问题，猛烧各种形形色色的资产阶级个人主义思想。他们中间有的不安心专业学习，想当作家“像杜甫，白居易那样留名后世”，或写一本书“流芳千古”，有的人甚至想成为“一百年后全世界纪念的名人”。财政系同学朱文华虽然二十岁，但就想成名成家，入学以来不爱专业，不问政治，成天埋头创作。哲学系一位同学在交心中揭露了自己的资产阶级人生观，想将来住洋房、坐汽车和找一位漂亮妻子，没有想到为人民学习。有些同学还检查了政治立场。法律系学生陈少林检讨自己在整风运动中立场不稳，在反右派斗争中还和一个女右派分子谈恋爱。这次他检查说：“这是认敌为友，用无产阶级利益换取卑鄙的资产阶级爱情。”
    同学们向党交心后放下了包袱，背起行李，喜气洋洋地到京郊十三陵工地去进行义务劳动，争取再在劳动中打一个胜仗，进一步锻炼自己。
