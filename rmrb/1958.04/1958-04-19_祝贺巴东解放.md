    Congratulations on the Liberation of Padang
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    The Indonesian government forces, having landed on the west coast of Sumatra, have achieved an initial victory with the liberation of Padang, the main seaport of the rebel group. The news of victory has been greeted with jubilation by all who love peace and freedom.
    This victory is not merely a military one; it is a victory for the Indonesian people in crushing the conspiracy of domestic and foreign reactionary forces to create division, and in safeguarding the independence and unity of their motherland. It is a victory for the Indonesian people in their struggle against colonialism and in defense of peace.
    Since the government forces landed in Central Sumatra on March 10, they have recovered the entire Riau region after about half a month of fighting. Subsequently, they divided their forces into two routes to directly attack the Bukit Tinggi-Payakumbuh-Solok area seized by the Hussein rebel group. One route of the government forces, after thwarting the Nainngolan rebel army's conspiracy to seize Medan, blocked the rebels' retreat route attempting to flee north. The other route of the government forces, after recovering Sungai Dareh, an important highway hub in West Sumatra, on April 15, cut off the rebels' escape route to South Sumatra. On April 17, the government forces landed again on the west coast, which was a fatal blow to the rebel group. Now that Padang has been liberated, Bukit Tinggi, the main city entrenched by the rebel group, is in dire straits. The day is coming when the Indonesian government and people will finally annihilate the Sumatra rebel group.
    The fundamental reason why the Indonesian government forces have been able to achieve victory so quickly lies in the enthusiastic support of the people throughout the country. Contrary to the predictions of imperialism, the Indonesian people have become more closely united in the struggle to suppress the rebel elements, and actively support the government forces. Especially in Sumatra, the government forces have been sincerely welcomed and assisted by the local masses wherever they go. The rebel group, on the other hand, has been deserted by its followers and lacks fighting spirit, and has long been destined for destruction.
    The victory of the Indonesian people in their anti-rebellion struggle is also a victory against foreign interference. This rebellion was manufactured by U.S. imperialism. After the establishment of the rebel "government," the United States has continuously issued blatant statements interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs, attempting to threaten the Indonesian people into abandoning the just cause of safeguarding independence and unity. In addition to making public statements of interference, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles personally came forward to plot interference in Indonesia at the Manila Conference and instructed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to airdrop weapons to the rebels. Recently, the U.S. State Department has made a big fuss about Indonesia's purchase of weapons from foreign countries, openly threatening the Indonesian government. However, all these acts of interference by the United States have been useless, but have aroused even greater indignation among the Indonesian people, making them more clearly aware that in order to safeguard their independence, they must more resolutely eliminate the rebel group.
    Although Padang, the main seaport occupied by the Sumatra rebels, has been liberated, the Indonesian people's anti-rebellion struggle has not yet completely ended. The Indonesian people will carry this struggle through to the end, thoroughly eliminate the rebel group, and thereby safeguard Indonesia's independence, peace and unity.

    祝贺巴东解放
    本报评论员
    从苏门答腊西海岸登陆的印度尼西亚政府军旗开得胜，叛乱集团的主要海港巴东宣告解放了。捷音传来，一切爱好和平与自由的人们无不欢欣鼓舞。
    这次胜利不仅仅是军事上的胜利，这是印度尼西亚人民粉碎国内外反动势力制造分裂的阴谋、捍卫祖国的独立和统一的胜利。这是印度尼西亚人民反对殖民主义和保卫和平斗争的胜利。
    自从3月10日政府军在中苏门答腊登陆以后，经过半个月左右的战斗，便收复了整个廖内地区。接着兵分两路直捣侯赛尼叛乱集团窃据的武吉丁宜—巴京—梭洛地区。一路政府军在挫败了奈恩戈兰叛军夺取棉兰的阴谋后，堵塞了叛乱分子企图北窜的退路。另一路政府军，在4月15日收复西苏门答腊的重要公路枢纽双溪冷沙后，切断了叛乱分子逃往南苏门答腊的道路。4月17日，政府军又从西海岸登陆，这是对于叛乱集团的致命一击。现在，巴东解放，叛乱集团盘踞的主要城市武吉丁宜已陷于绝境。印度尼西亚政府和人民最后歼灭苏门答腊叛乱集团的日子已经来临了。
    印度尼西亚政府军之所以能够如此迅速地取得胜利，根本原因在于获得了全国人民的热烈拥护。同帝国主义的预言相反，印度尼西亚人民在镇压叛乱分子的斗争中，更加紧密地团结起来，积极地支援政府军。特别是在苏门答腊，政府军所到之处，受到当地群众的忠诚欢迎和帮助。而叛乱集团则众叛亲离，士无斗志，早就注定了灭亡的命运。
    印度尼西亚人民反叛乱斗争的胜利，也是反对外国干涉的胜利。这次叛乱活动就是美帝国主义制造的。在叛乱“政府”成立后，美国更不断发表露骨的干涉印度尼西亚内政的言论，企图威胁印度尼西亚人民放弃维护独立和统一的正义事业。美国国务卿杜勒斯除发表公开的干涉言论外，还亲自出马在马尼拉会议上策划干涉印度尼西亚的阴谋，并且指使蒋介石集团空投武器给叛乱分子。最近，美国国务院又在印度尼西亚从外国购买武器的事情上大做文章，公开恫吓印度尼西亚政府。但是，美国的这一切干涉活动都没有用，却激起了印度尼西亚人民的更大愤慨，使他们更加看清楚了，为了保卫自己的独立，就必须更加坚决地消灭叛乱集团。
    苏门答腊叛乱分子所盘踞的主要海港巴东虽已解放，但印度尼西亚人民的反叛乱斗争还没有完全结束。印度尼西亚人民将会把这场斗争进行到底，彻底消灭叛乱集团，从而保卫印度尼西亚的独立、和平与统一。
