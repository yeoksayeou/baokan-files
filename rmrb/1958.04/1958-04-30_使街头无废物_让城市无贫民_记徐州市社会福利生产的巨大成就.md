Making Streets Waste-Free, Making Cities Poverty-Free
    ——A Record of the Great Achievements of Social Welfare Production in Xuzhou City
    By Our Correspondent
    People walking into the streets and alleys of Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, will discover a very unusual scene: many households have signs hanging in front of their doors that read "Social Welfare Production Factory" or "Social Welfare Production Group." These are production organizations that the civil affairs department of Xuzhou City has mobilized the city's impoverished people and families of revolutionary martyrs to set up themselves. Currently, there are 301 such production organizations in the city.

    The Elderly "Old but Not Decayed"
    The Disabled "Disabled but Not Useless"

    When production is mentioned, people naturally think of those who can carry and shoulder heavy loads, the strong and robust. However, here it is not like that. Among the nearly 20,000 people involved, 80% are housewives with only semi-labor capacity, gray-haired elderly, children in their teens, and even disabled people who cannot hear, speak, see, or are missing limbs. In the mat-weaving factory in Yunlong District, there is a workshop for the blind with more than a dozen people. Although they are blind, they have learned the technique of weaving mats by relying on their memory and feeling with their hands. In March, this one workshop produced more than 200 mats. Grandpa Zhang, a blind man who can weave more than one mat a day, said excitedly to me: In the old society, I couldn't do anything, endured hunger and cold, and lived most of my life in vain. The older I got, the less I enjoyed life, and I thought of jumping into the river to end it all several times. But after participating in production, I don't have to worry about food and clothing, and the older I get, the more I want to live. This voice, this feeling is common. In the shoe sole factory, seven elderly women over the age of fifty formed a production group to tie rags. They sat on clean mats, busily but happily tying up scraps of cloth. Wang Gao, the group leader, jokingly said: There was a saying in the old society, "Old cows can be sold for money, old people are sent to the fields." But today, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are not only not sent to the fields, but we have also become old workers! My eyes glanced over their faces, and on each of their wrinkled faces, there was a glimmer of the afterglow of youth. They were humming the recently learned song "The East is Red" in a way that sounded like singing and chanting.
      
    Discarded "Garbage"
    Becomes "Priceless Treasure"

    As everyone knows, production requires people and money. What if there are people but no money? On this question, Meng Jinxuan, Director of the Xuzhou City Civil Affairs Bureau, said with such firmness and optimism: "Our method is to rely on the masses, utilize waste materials, start from scratch, grow from small to large, use the large to带动 the small, and develop forward. Therefore, the waste materials that are usually regarded as 'garbage' become 'priceless treasures' here. Now, about thirty kinds of waste materials can be made into several hundred kinds of 'treasures'." Turning waste into "treasure" is a miracle that attracted me, so I visited many "waste materials" and also visited the "treasures." In the feather factory, the factory director took me into a workshop, where I saw all kinds of feathers, white ones as white as snow, black ones as black as crows, and colorful ones as colorful as flowers. They looked like clusters of flowers when gathered together and scattered like heavenly maidens scattering flowers. The factory director told me that there are more than 200 kinds of feathers here, which are sold to fifteen countries. They are taken to be processed and made into beautiful decorations for women. In another workshop, I saw the raw materials for "feathers," which turned out to be the dirty and messy chicken feathers that people had thrown away. In the hardware smelting group of the Diannan Residents' Committee in Gulou District, seventy-four-year-old Grandpa Ren Yuyun grabbed a handful of something from a torn burlap sack. When he accidentally dropped a little from his fingers to the ground, he quickly and gently picked it up with his fingers. I looked and saw that it was a pile of grayish-brown mud. I couldn't help but ask, "Is there copper or iron in this?" But he pointed to the newly smelted, golden-yellow horseshoe copper and said, "These copper blocks are smelted from this stuff." No wonder he regarded these things as "jewels in his palm."

    Relief Recipients No Longer Need Relief
        Thanking Chairman Mao Over and Over Again

    In 1955, there were still more than 28,000 impoverished people and relief recipients in Xuzhou, but by April of this year, no state relief funds were needed. The economic lives of the relief recipients have changed greatly. In some places, the living expenses of each relief recipient were originally only two or three yuan per month, but now they have reached eight or nine yuan. People who come to visit and ask questions are surrounded as soon as they walk into the former "slum areas." People enthusiastically and eagerly recount their improved living conditions. Some say that they couldn't even afford a pair of chopsticks before liberation, but now they have a thermos and an alarm clock. Some say that they used to have no way to borrow money, but now they have money in the bank. Others say that they used to eat chaff and vegetables for half the year, but now they are eating white flour buns. When we visited Granny Wang, a relief recipient in Yunlong District, a middle-aged woman said: Granny Wang and her son used to be regular relief recipients, living in a shed made of sorghum stalks. When it snowed in winter, the bed and the ground were all white. Now, both mother and son are participating in the production team, earning more than 20 yuan a month. They have enough to eat and wear, rebuilt their house, bought 18 yuan of public bonds, and have more than 10 yuan in the bank. Every time someone comes to visit and ask questions, they want someone to send her a message, "Thank you, our great benefactor, Chairman Mao." Granny Wang's simple and enthusiastic words represent the hearts of the thousands upon thousands of impoverished people in Xuzhou who are shaking off poverty.
   
    Supplements the Shortcomings of Local Industry
    Changing the Economic Landscape of Xuzhou

    Social welfare production in Xuzhou is also changing the entire economic landscape of Xuzhou. In 1957, the total output value of this aspect of production reached more than 3.4 million yuan, accounting for 7.46% of the total output value of Xuzhou's handicrafts industry, greatly making up for the shortcomings of local industry. The vast majority of products not only meet the needs of the people of Xuzhou, but are also sold far and wide at home and abroad. The hemp knives produced by the hemp knife factory, which are used for construction, sell well in Hebei, Lanzhou, Inner Mongolia and other places. Obviously, social welfare production in Xuzhou has become an important part of the city's local industry. According to Tao Youliang, First Secretary of the Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, this production has now been incorporated into the entire industrial production plan of Xuzhou.

    Promoted All Work
          Strengthened the Relationship Between Cadres and the Masses

    Social welfare production has not only changed the economic landscape of Xuzhou, but also the political and spiritual landscape of Xuzhou. The director of the Tiehuo Residents' Committee once told me a meaningful story: When they subscribed to public bonds this year, the street office assigned a task of 200 yuan, and the cadres felt unsure. As a result, they subscribed to 1,010 yuan within three hours. It was also this residents' committee that, driven by activists, became the first "four-without" street in the city. The situation in this residents' committee is the epitome of the entire Xuzhou. In many residents' committees, you can find such touching examples.

    Social welfare production is also changing the relationship between cadres and the masses. Some impoverished people and relief recipients who used to ignore cadres when they saw them now take the initiative to go to the cadres' homes to reflect on their past mistakes. Some female cadres run around outside all day and have no time to take care of housework, so relief recipients help take care of them during their spare time. The cadres return home late at night and say excitedly: Now I truly realize that wholeheartedly serving the people is the greatest glory and pleasure.

    Social welfare production in Xuzhou has opened up a road for civil affairs work in Xuzhou. Now, they are advancing along this road, striving to have all impoverished people remove the label of "impoverished" by 1960 and become a city without impoverished people. (Attached picture)

    使街头无废物　让城市无贫民
    ——记徐州市社会福利生产的巨大成就
    本报记者
    人们走进江苏省徐州市的大街小巷，就会发现一种很不平常的景象：很多人家门前挂着“社会福利生产厂”，“社会福利生产小组”的招牌。这就是徐州市民政部门发动徐州市贫民、烈军属自己搞起来的生产组织，目前，全市有这样的生产组织三百零一个。
    老年人“老而不衰”
    残废人“残而不废”
    一提起生产，人们会自然地联想到那些能挑能肩、精强力壮的人，然而在这里，却不是这样，在近两万人当中，有80％是只有半劳动力的家庭妇女，白发苍苍的老人，十多岁的孩子，甚至还有有耳不能听、有嘴不能说、有眼不能看以及断腿缺臂的残废的人。在云龙区席薄厂有一个十多人的盲人生产车间，他们虽然双目失明，但是凭脑子记忆，凭手摸，学会了编薄技术。在3月份，他们这一个车间一共生产了二百多张薄。一天能打一张多薄的盲人张大爷激动地对我说：在旧社会里我什么也不能干，忍饿受冻，白白活了大半辈子，越活越没味，几次想跳河死了算。可是，参加了生产以后，不愁吃穿，越活越想活下去。这种声音，这种心情是共同的，在鞋底厂，七个五十岁以上的老大娘组成一个拴破布生产小组，他们坐在干净的席子上，紧张地、但却愉快地拴着烂布头。小组长王高氏逗趣地说：旧社会有句话：“牛老能卖钱，人老送下田，”可今天在毛主席领导下，我们不仅没有下田，还成了老工人啦！坐在他旁边的五十四岁的王王氏和六十多岁的朱梦氏嘴吧里似唱似念地哼着最近学来的“东方红”的歌子。我的眼光掠过了他们的面孔，在她们每一个充满皱纹的脸上，都闪烁着青春的余辉。
      被扔了的“垃圾”
      成了“无价之宝”
    大家知道，搞生产一要人，二要钱，有了人，但是没有钱怎么办？在这个问题上，徐州市民政局孟劲轩局长说得那样坚定，那样乐观：“我们的办法是依靠群众，利用废料，白手起家，由小到大，以大带小，向前发展，因此，通常被人们看成是‘垃圾’的废物，到我们这里便成了“无价之宝”，现在约有三十多种废物可以造成好几百种
  ‘宝’”。废料变“宝”，是个奇迹，它吸引了我，我就参观了许多“废料”，也参观了“宝”。在羽毛厂，厂长带我进入一个车间，只见各式各样的羽毛，白的洁白，黑的乌黑，花的五彩缤纷，圈起来有如花团锦簇，散开来活似天女散花。厂长告诉我：这里共分成二百多种羽毛，行销十五个国家，他们拿去加工后，做成妇女身上的漂亮的装饰品。在另一个车间，我看到了“羽毛”的原料，原来就是又脏又乱被人们扔掉的鸡毛；在鼓楼区电南居民委员会五金熔炼小组，七十四岁的老大爷任玉云从破麻袋里，抓了一把东西，当他一不小心，从手指缝里掉了一点到地上的时候，连忙用手指轻轻地捡了起来。我一看，原来是一堆灰溜溜的泥屑，情不自禁地问：“这里面难道有铜？有铁？”可是，他却用手指指刚刚出炉的黄澄澄的马蹄铜说：“这些铜块就是从这东西里面炼出来的”。这就难怪他把这些东西视如“掌上明珠”了。
      救济户不要救济了
        口口声声感谢毛主席
    在1955年，徐州还有贫民和救济户二万八千多人，可是到今年4月份，就不要国家发放一个救济款了。救济户的经济生活发生了很大变化，有些地方救济户每人每月的生活费原来只有二、三元，现在达到了八、九元。参观、访问的人们，一走到过去的“贫民区”，就会给人们包围起来，热情地、争先恐后地诉说生活上升的情况。有的说，他解放前连双筷子都买不起，现在有了热水瓶，还有了闹钟。有的说，过去求借无门，现在自己在银行里存了钱。还有的说，过去半年糠菜半年粮，现在吃上了白面馒头。我们在访问云龙区救济户王大娘的时候，一个中年妇女说：王大娘母子俩，过去是个常年救济户，住的是高粱秆搭成的棚子，冬天一下雪，床上，地下，一片洁白。现在，娘儿俩全参加了生产组，一个月挣二十来元，有吃有穿，重新翻盖了房子，买了十八元公债，银行里还有十多元存款。每次有人去参观、访问的时候，就要人给她捎个信，“谢谢大恩人毛主席。”王大娘的这句淳朴、热情的话，代表了千千万万正在摆脱贫困的徐州市贫民的心。
    补充了地方工业的不足
    改变着徐州的经济面貌
    徐州市的社会福利生产，还在改变整个徐州市的经济面貌，1957年，这一方面的生产总值达到三百四十多万元，占徐州市手工业生产总值的7.46％，大大弥补了地方工业的不足。极大多数产品，不仅供应徐州人民需要，还远销中外各地，麻刀厂生产的供建筑用的麻刀，就畅销河北、兰州、内蒙古等地。显然，徐州市的社会福利生产已经成为这个市的地方工业的一个重要组成部分。据中共徐州市委第一书记陶有亮告诉我：这项生产现在已经纳入徐州市整个工业生产计划里面了。
    推动了一切工作
          密切了干群关系
    社会福利生产不仅改变了徐州市的经济面貌，还在改变徐州市的政治面貌、精神面貌。铁货居民委员会的主任曾对我讲过一个意味深长的故事：他们在今年认购公债时，街道办事处分配任务是二百元，干部感到信心不足，结果在三个小时内认购了一千零十元。也是这个居民委员会，在积极分子带动下，成了全市第一个“四无”街道。这个居民委员会的情况是整个徐州市的缩影，在许许多多居民委员会里，你都可以找到这样动人心弦的事例。
    社会福利生产还在改变着干部和群众的关系，有些过去看到干部不理不睬的贫民和救济户，主动跑到干部家里检讨过去不对；有些妇女干部终日在外奔跑，无暇处理家务，救济户就在生产余暇，帮助照料，干部夜半回来，激动地说：现在真正体会到忠心为人民服务是最大的光荣和愉快。
    徐州市的社会福利生产给徐州市民政工作开辟了一条道路，现在，他们正沿着这条道路前进，争取1960年使所有贫民摘掉贫民帽子，变成没有贫民的城市。（附图片）
    看：社会福利生产给徐州铁货居民委员会九十户贫民的生活带来多大变化。
