Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th - The National Youth Workers' Representative Conference closed today.

The closing ceremony was held in Culture Square, with more than 13,000 young people from all walks of life in Shanghai attending the meeting. The conference adopted the proposal from the National Youth Workers' Representative Conference to the nation's young workers, a letter of respect to the nation's veteran workers, and a pledge to the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao.

The proposal stated: We young workers must strive to be diligent, frugal, red, and expert. We must follow the teachings of the Party, work hard, build the country with diligence and thrift, and become good, hardworking, and thrifty workers, promoters of socialist construction; we must study hard, train diligently, and strive for rapid growth politically and technically, striving to become red and expert as soon as possible, deeply red and highly expert. The proposal calls on every young worker to establish a collectivist ideology of "one for all, all for one," to work diligently, consciously abide by discipline, resolutely resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and constantly improve class consciousness. The proposal put forward eight specific proposals, working together with the nation's ten million young men and women employees, encouraging and motivating each other. (The full text of the proposal is on page two)

The letter of respect to the nation's veteran workers stated: "We will definitely work harder to learn from you in the future. We will learn from your firm class stand of loving the Party and loving socialism; learn from your spirit of selfless labor, hard work, loving the factory as your home; learn from your hardworking and simple lifestyle and your excellent qualities of modesty and prudence; learn from your rich production experience and your spirit of diligently studying technology. We are determined to accept all the excellent qualities of the working class from you, so that we can become class fighters with awareness, organization, and discipline, and become your most promising successors, shouldering the responsibilities of the leadership class."

Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a report at the closing ceremony entitled "People Are the Decisive Factor in Our Great Cause." He said: China's industry is soaring. In order to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, our Party is currently taking several important measures, such as carrying out a deep-seated anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, rapidly developing local industries, and widely conducting technical revolutions. This year, China's total industrial output value will increase by 33% compared with last year, which is twice as fast as the average speed of industrial development during the first five-year plan. If we continue to develop at this rate, China can catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more. Hu Yaobang said: Industry is developing so rapidly, but there are very few veteran workers and the technical strength is very weak. This brings glorious and arduous tasks to the ten million young employees, who account for nearly half of the total number of employees in the country. However, most of the young workers are students who have just left school or farmers who have just put down their hoes. Their thinking and technology are very immature and do not match the important responsibilities of the working class; bourgeois ideology will continue to exist for a long time and will use our immature weaknesses to influence us. Our thinking must continue to leap forward with the progress of the motherland.

Hu Yaobang emphasized: The socialist era has elevated the role of people to an unprecedented height, requiring us to master both the laws of social development and the laws of natural development; requiring us to become both masters of society and masters of nature. The era requires young workers to be people with high political awareness, cultural accomplishments, and proficient production skills. The slogan of being both red and expert, deeply red and highly expert, precisely reflects the historical requirements for our generation of young people. We must master both advanced ideology and advanced technology at the same time, so that we can be like adding two wings, and we can soar high, have a bright future, and make the greatest contribution to the motherland.

Hu Yaobang gave detailed instructions on how young workers can be both red and expert. He proposed that on the road to becoming deeply red and highly expert, young workers must first increase their ambition, second master technology, third study hard, fourth create bravely, fifth be both diligent and frugal, and sixth be united and friendly.

Liang Buting, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and Executive Chairman of the conference, delivered a closing speech at the meeting.

    永远成为建设祖国的一支英勇突击队
    青年工人必须又勤又俭又红又专
    全国青年工人代表会议通过了倡议书和保证书
    据新华社上海12日电　全国青年工人代表会议今天闭幕。
    闭幕式在文化广场举行，上海各界青年一万三千多人列席了会议。会上通过了全国青年工人代表会议向全国青年工人的倡议书、向全国老工人致敬信和向中共中央和毛主席的保证书。
    倡议书说：我们青年工人，必须努力做到又勤、又俭、又红、又专。我们一定要遵照党的教导，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国，成为勤劳的节俭的好工人，成为社会主义建设的促进派；一定要努力学习，刻苦锻炼，争取政治上和技术上的迅速成长，争取早红早专，红透专深。倡议书要求每一个青年工人，树立起“我为人人，人人为我”的集体主义思想，勤勤恳恳劳动，自觉地遵守纪律，坚决抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，不断提高阶级觉悟。倡议书提出了八项具体倡议，同全国一千万男女青年职工，共同努力，互勉互励。（倡议书全文见第二版）
    在向全国老工人致敬信中说：“我们今后一定更加努力地向您们学习。学习您们热爱党、热爱社会主义的坚定的阶级立场；学习您们忘我劳动、艰苦奋斗、爱厂如家的精神；学习您们勤俭朴素的生活作风和谦虚谨慎的优良品德；学习您们丰富的生产经验和钻研技术的刻苦精神。我们决心把您们身上所有的工人阶级的优良品质都接受过来，使自己成为有觉悟、有组织、有纪律的阶级战士，成为您们最有出息的接班人，把领导阶级的责任担负起来。”
    团中央第一书记胡耀邦在闭幕式上作了题为“人是我们伟大事业的决定因素”的报告。他说：我国的工业正在展翅高飞。为了多快好省地建设社会主义，我们的党当前采取了深入开展反浪费反保守运动、迅速发展地方工业、广泛进行技术革命这样几个重要措施。今年我国工业总产值将比去年增长33％，比第一个五年计划期间工业发展的平均速度快一倍。按这样的速度发展下去，在十五年或更多一点时间内，我国可以在钢铁和其他主要工业生产品方面赶上或超过英国。胡耀邦说：工业是这样迅速地发展，工人阶级的老骨干却很少，技术力量又很薄弱。这就给将近全国职工总数一半的一千万青年职工，带来了光荣、艰巨的任务。但是，青年工人大部分都是刚出校门的学生，刚放下锄头的农民，思想上技术上都很不成熟，跟工人阶级肩负的重大责任不相适应；资产阶级思想还会长期存在，还会利用我们不成熟的弱点来影响我们。我们的思想必须跟着祖国的前进而不断跃进。
    胡耀邦强调说：社会主义时代把人的作用提到了空前的高度，它要求我们既能掌握社会发展的规律，又能掌握自然发展的规律；要求我们既成为社会的主人，又成为大自然的主人。时代要求青年工人是具有高度政治觉悟、有文化修养和精通生产技能的人。又红又专、红透专深的口号，正是反映了历史对我们这一代青年的要求。我们必须把先进思想和先进技术同时掌握起来，这样，就好比添了两个翅膀，就能展翅高飞，鹏程万里，为祖国作出最大的贡献。
    胡耀邦对青年工人如何做到又红又专作了详细的指示。他提出青年工人们在向红透专深前进的道路上，一要增长志气，二要掌握技术，三要刻苦学习，四要勇敢创造，五要又勤又俭，六要团结友爱。
    会议的执行主席、团中央书记处书记梁步庭在会上致闭幕词。
