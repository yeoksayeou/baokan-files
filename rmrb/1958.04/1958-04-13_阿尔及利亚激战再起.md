Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, April 12th: It is announced here that on the 10th, French colonial troops engaged in fierce fighting with a strong Algerian National Liberation Army in the Debar Mountains of the Guerma region in eastern Algeria. French colonial troops dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle, bombing wildly from 13:30 to 21:00 local time. However, even so, according to the French military's typically exaggerated figures, only thirty-nine members of the Algerian National Liberation Army were killed. French troop casualties were not announced.
Two days prior, in the Constantine province of eastern Algeria, French troops had three encounters with the Algerian National Liberation Army in one day. French troops deployed paratroopers, helicopters, and fighter jets to coordinate with infantry operations.
French Minister of Defense Chaban-Delmas announced that from April 1st to 7th, French troops and Algerian people's forces had a total of one hundred and twenty-seven military clashes.

    阿尔及利亚激战再起
    据新华社12日讯　阿尔及尔消息：这里宣布，法国殖民军10日在阿尔及利亚东部格尔马地区的德巴尔山，同一支强大的阿尔及利亚民族解放军激战。法国殖民军出动飞机助战，从当地时间十三点三十分一直狂炸到二十一点。但是，即使是这样，根据法军战报中通常夸大的数字，阿尔及利亚民族解放军也只有三十九人阵亡。法军伤亡数字没有宣布。
    在这以前两天，在阿尔及利亚东部的君士坦丁省，法军一天之内就同阿尔及利亚民族解放军发生了三次遭遇战。法军出动伞兵、直升飞机和战斗机协同步兵作战。
    法国国防部长沙邦—戴尔马宣布，从4月1日到7日，法军和阿尔及利亚人民的部队一共发生了一百二十七次军事冲突。
