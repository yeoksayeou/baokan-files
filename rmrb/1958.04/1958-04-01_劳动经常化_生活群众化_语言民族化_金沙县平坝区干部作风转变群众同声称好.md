Labor Regularization, Life Massification, Language Nationalization
Cadres’ Work Style Transformation in Pingba District, Jinsha County, Praised by the Masses

    This newspaper reports according to the Guizhou Daily: Since the unfolding of the Rectification Campaign, the work style of cadres in Pingba District, Jinsha County, Guizhou, has undergone profound changes, forming a great leap forward in work style. Now, cadres throughout the district have basically achieved labor regularization, life massification, and language nationalization.
    In the past, although most of the cadres in Pingba District were diligent and conscientious in their work, they did not fully recognize the great significance of participating in physical labor. They rarely or never directly participated in production, and therefore, there was a certain distance between them and the local masses in various aspects such as life, thought, and emotion. The masses criticized these cadres' work style as: "Five Many and Three Few." The "Five Many" meant: walking on the field ridges a lot, issuing many work calls, spending much time in the offices of the commune management committees listening to the words of the commune cadres, staying in the township government offices for a long time, and yelling at people a lot; the "Three Few" meant: participating in physical labor too little, visiting commune members to understand the situation too little, and solving specific difficulties for the masses of townships and communes too little.
    During the Rectification Campaign, the district Party committee decided to bring about a great leap forward in the work style of cadres. It required each cadre to do one hundred labor days a year, and when working in the countryside, to eat, live, and dress the same as the masses. At the same time, cadres who frequently worked in rural areas were required to learn the Miao language.
    The district Party committee's decision was warmly welcomed by the vast majority of cadres. Now, the cadres in this district have basically achieved labor regularization. According to statistics, twelve cadres have worked a total of four hundred and forty-nine labor days. At the same time, the location of the district Party committee meetings has also been moved from the former office to the construction site. The principle is to hold meetings wherever there is advanced work. In terms of life, massification has been achieved. At present, all cadres have taken off their leather shoes and put on straw sandals, taken off their felt hats and wrapped their heads with scarves, taken off their uniforms and put on casual clothes, and women cadres have also removed the "flower butterflies" from their heads. Except for cadres stationed in the district, all have achieved living and eating with the commune members wherever they work. In terms of learning the Miao language, language nationalization has also been basically achieved. Of the seventeen Han cadres and two Yi cadres who frequently work in rural areas throughout the district, all but two Han cadres have learned the Miao language. The district Party committee can now basically hold meetings and read newspapers in the Miao language.
    The leap forward in the work style of cadres has brought great benefits to the work. Cadres generally feel that the work is easier to promote, the masses reflect more situations, and problems that have been buried in the masses for a long time have been discovered. The masses greatly welcome the transformation of the cadres' work style, saying: "This is what a cadre of Chairman Mao should look like." The masses see the cadres as if they were truly family members, no longer acting like "outsiders."

    劳动经常化　生活群众化　语言民族化
    金沙县平坝区干部作风转变群众同声称好
    本报讯　据贵州日报报道：整风运动开展以来，贵州金沙县平坝区的干部作风已发生深刻变化，形成作风上的大跃进。全区干部现在基本做到了劳动经常化，生活群众化，语言民族化。
    过去，平坝区的大部分干部虽然也都能勤勤恳恳地工作，但由于当时对参加体力劳动的伟大意义认识不足，没有或很少直接参加生产，因而在生活、思想、情感等各个方面和当地群众都还有一定距离。群众批评这些干部的作风是：五多三少。五多是：走田坎多，工作号召多，走社管会的办公室听社干部的话多，在乡公所住的时间多，吼人多；三少是：参加体力劳动少，访问社员了解情况少，给乡社群众解决具体困难少。
    在整风过程中，区委决定要使干部作风也来一个大跃进。要求每个干部一年要做一百个劳动日，在乡里工作时，要与群众同吃、同住、同穿；同时要求经常在农村工作的干部学会苗族语言。
    区委的这个决定，得到了绝大多数干部的热烈响应。现在，这个区的干部在劳动方面，已基本作到了经常化。根据统计，十二个干部所做的劳动日，共有四百四十九个。与此同时，区委开会的地点也由过去的办公室搬到了工地，原则是哪里先进就在哪里开会。在生活方面，已经做到群众化。目前全体干部已经脱下皮鞋，换上草鞋，摘下呢帽，包上帕子，脱下制服，换上便衣，妇女干部也取下了头上的“花蝴蝶”；除了区驻地的干部，都已做到在哪里工作，就在哪里同社员一起住，同样吃。在学习苗族语言方面，也已基本作到语言民族化，全区经常做农村工作的十七个汉族干部和两个彝族干部，除了两个汉族干部外，都已学会了苗族话。区委已基本可以用苗语开会、读报。
    干部作风的跃进，给工作带来了极大好处，干部普遍感到工作好推动，群众反映情况多，长期埋在群众中的问题被发觉了。群众对干部作风的转变十分欢迎，说：这才像个毛主席的干部的样子。群众见了干部，真正亲如家人，不再“见外”了。
