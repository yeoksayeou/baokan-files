    Welcoming This Kind of Poetic Style
    Opening up the "Liberation Army Literature" from January to March of this year and recent issues of "People's Literature," "Changjiang Literature," and other publications, one truly feels refreshed. Especially those mountain songs that are smooth, easy to understand, and full of a strong sense of life, we read them all in one go.
    In the past, soldiers didn't really like reading "Liberation Army Literature," saying they couldn't understand it, but now as soon as it arrives in the company, the soldiers snatch it up, saying, "Look, this quick-rhythm poem is so beautiful to read!" During drills and breaks, one can hear the soldiers reciting quick-rhythm poems.
    "People's Literature" has also put down the airs of a major publication and published works by workers, peasants, and soldiers; the front page of the March issue of "Changjiang Literature" is the "Selected Poems of the Great Leap Forward in Macheng." These are all songs sung by the working people themselves during their intense labor, and the working people themselves love to read them and understand them thoroughly. We welcome the publication of more of these mountain songs in newspapers and magazines.

    欢迎这样的诗风
    翻开今年1至3月的“解放军文艺”和近期的“人民文学”、“长江文艺”等刊物，真是令人感到满目清新。特别是那些顺口的、通俗易懂的、富有浓厚生活气息的山歌，我们都是一口气读完了的。
    “解放军文艺”以前战士们都不大喜欢看，说看不懂，可现在一到连队，战士们就抢，说：“看，这快板诗读起来多美气！”在操练完毕和休息的时候，都能听到战士们背诵快板诗的声音。
    “人民文学”也放下了大刊物的架子，发表了工农兵的作品；“长江文艺”三月号首页就是“麻城生产大跃进诗选”这都是劳动人民自己在紧张的劳动中唱起来的歌，劳动人民自己爱看，也看得懂，理解得透。我们欢迎报刊上多发表这些山歌。
