Liu Erdun is from Renqiu, Hebei. He is thirty years old this year. He joined the army in 1947 and worked as a communicator for a year before being transferred to the logistics department of North China. At that time, they only used earth-colored cloth dyed with locust seeds to make military uniforms. In Gaoyang, there were still dyeing vats to use; when the enemy attacked, retreating to the Wuqiang area, they could only use large pots to boil them. Therefore, although he worked as a cloth dyeing worker for two years, he had never seen a machine.

After entering the city in 1949, he first stayed in Beijing, and then in 1950 he was transferred to Tianjin, where he learned to use machines to dye cloth. By 1953, he had become a skilled printing and dyeing worker. In that same year, he became the director of the workshop; in 1955, he became the deputy director of the Tianjin Second Printing and Dyeing Factory.

After becoming the factory director, he felt that this was the Party's cultivation, and only by working hard could he live up to the Party's painstaking efforts to educate him. But at that time, he began to feel that being a factory director was not as enjoyable as being a worker. As a worker, he could exert as much effort as he had. The Xinhua brand blue twill fabric that he dyed was smooth and bright. The snow-white cloth rolled on the shaft frame, and then climbed from the dyeing tank to another row of shaft frames, and the color changed. The workshop was filled with steaming heat, with a slightly bitter smell of sulfur blue, mixed with the warm breath of the workers, making people feel comfortable even breathing. But it was not like this when he was the factory director. He sat in the office all day long, filled with smoke, and always felt dry in his nose and throat. Every day's work was either buried in piles of documents, or endless meetings. Or, he was grabbing the phone and arguing with the company; until his voice was hoarse and his arms were numb, arguing about a penny's worth of things until he was exhausted.

At first, he always blamed himself for not being capable enough, and wondered if the Party had promoted him too quickly. A poor child who picked firewood had become a factory director in just a few years... So he worked even harder, often staying up several nights.

What troubled him most was that the more he did this, the further he was from the workers. He rarely saw those workmates who used to be in the same workshop, the same section, and watched the same machine with him; when they saw him and spoke to him, they first called him "Director Liu," but behind his back they called him "Official Liu," which made him extremely distressed. Sometimes he thought: To hell with it! What factory director or not, weren't we all working together before, all the same workers... Sometimes he thought again: Since I'm the factory director, I have to act like a factory director... So he became more cautious in his words and deeds. When the workers saw him like this, they became even less likely to approach him.

After the rectification campaign, the workers criticized the three major isms of the factory leadership. He was both happy and unconvinced. He was happy that the workers dared to criticize him; unconvinced, he felt that he was working hard, even more bitter and tired than being a worker, who would want to get a bad ism on himself?

The deeper the rectification campaign went, the more he felt that he should return to the workshop and be with the workers. But he also felt that this was not right, that it was like escaping the more important responsibility that the Party had given him than being an ordinary worker. He experienced this contradiction, but did not know how to resolve it.

At first, according to the instructions of the superior Party committee, he and other leading cadres implemented regular participation in physical labor, half a day every week; they also held worker forums every Thursday, and received workers every Saturday. In short, he wanted to use every means to restore the close relationship with the workers like before. But the more he did this, the more he felt that there was indeed a distance between him and the workers. He went down to the workshop to participate in production, standing in front of the machine. Before, his hand touched the machine like a mother's hand touched her child, and he could clearly feel its joy, its demands, and its wishes with every breath and every pulse. But now, the machine had become alienated from him, and it felt cold and icy to the touch. When he felt this, he was simply shocked.

During the Spring Festival, the Party branch secretary, Lao Li, invited the factory's leading cadres to talk heart-to-heart, learn from the experience of Hong'an County, Hubei, in running experimental fields, and also talked about the article about the Red Army regimental commander becoming a farmer. Liu Erdun was happy at this time, and he thought: Can I have a semi-detached job, being both a factory director and a worker?

He raised this idea at the meeting. Everyone thought it was good, but there were also many difficulties. For example, how to take care of the overall work, who would manage the department work, and how would collective leadership be formed? In short, the difficulties seemed to be extremely numerous.

At this time, Party branch secretary Li Zhangcheng said:

"This year's quality target is set at 99.5%. When it was given to the workers for discussion, the workers said: 'Last year it was still 99.6%, but this year it's 99.5%! Who did you consult with when you set this target? Our construction of socialism is like climbing a ladder, and we always have to climb higher than the last step. You leaders are in front, and we workers are behind. If you stand still, when will we be able to reach socialism!' You see, the workers are saying such things, and things are different now."

When everyone heard this, they thought, yes! Can climbing a ladder stop halfway and block the way for those behind? No, you have to climb, climb hard. If the force below is strong, urging you, then those above have to climb even faster.

In this way, the Party branch committee made a decision: cadres should go to the workshop to keep up with production. So, as soon as the Spring Festival was over, Liu Erdun arranged the work in the factory, and on February 28, he officially started working on the shift.

At first, there was no difference to be seen when Director Liu went to the workshop to keep up with production. The workers did not show any special enthusiasm; some even looked at him with suspicious and expectant eyes. When he wanted to work on the shaft frame, the workers said:

"Let us do it, Director, this is heavy work."

When it was time to eat, the workers said:

"Director, you go eat first, while the food is still hot."

Liu Erdun felt ashamed and grateful when he heard these words. All the hot energy in his stomach was used on the machine. When the workers saw it, they thought, this director is really capable, he hasn't touched the machine for five years, but his technique hasn't been lost. Although he seemed a little unskilled, his enthusiasm was really great. They also secretly exerted their strength.

In this way, the cloth dyed in the dyeing workshop became more and more every day, and it also became better and better every day. From a daily output of 62,000 meters, it increased to 64,000 meters, 65,000 meters, and 66,000 meters. As for the quality, 90% of the people reached 100%.

Liu Erdun stood in front of the blackboard with the daily output and quality written on it, feeling unspeakably happy. He remembered how he used to come to the workshop, just standing and looking like this, but the production numbers were like this today, like this tomorrow, and still like this the day after tomorrow. The feeling of "a dumb person eating Coptis chinensis, unable to express the bitterness" was incomparable to this situation, and he really didn't know how to describe it. At that time, the workers called him "Blackboard Director." When he stood here, he himself felt guilty first. But now, he stood in front of the blackboard with confidence, watching the production indicators rise every day.

At this time, someone patted him on the shoulder from behind. He turned his head and saw that it was the old worker Wang Nianrong.

"Director Liu," he said with a smile, "looking at the blackboard now is different from before."

Liu Erdun blushed. He felt that this joke was not light. But the worker could joke with him like this, and the meaning was to praise him, so he calmed down, but couldn't think of a reply.

"You see," Wang Nianrong continued, as if he hadn't noticed anything, "production is changing every day. Not to mention you working on the shift, even if you stand with us, we feel happy, and we work harder. It's good to work when you're happy, isn't it?"

Liu Erdun nodded, feeling that he couldn't be silent any longer. So he opened his mouth and said:

"As long as you are happy, I'll do whatever you want."

After saying that, his face flushed again. Because he didn't expect that as soon as he opened his mouth, he would say his own thoughts. The workers would find it strange to hear this. He wanted to explain, but Wang Nianrong laughed heartily.

"What do we want you to do? No, Lao Liu, as long as you are with us, it's okay even if you don't work."

Liu Erdun turned around, his face red, and tightly grasped Wang Nianrong's hand.

From that day on, Director Liu moved into the workers' dormitory. He made his bed next to Wang Nianrong's. When he first lay down, he felt that the room was a bit cold. But soon, because he was tired from working during the day, he fell asleep. When he woke up in the middle of the night, he felt hot. He reached out and felt that Wang Nianrong, who was sleeping next to him, was gone, but his quilt was covering him. He sat up and listened. In the workshop below the collective dormitory, which used to be the pulping tank installation workshop of the Japanese Rotary Paper Mill, there was a clanging sound. "What's going on?" He remembered that the workers had announced during the day that they would install machines there. So he got up to take a look. The lights were on inside. Young worker Li Wenlin took the lead, and old worker Wang Nianrong was also there, as well as Li Kezhen—this person didn't go home during the Spring Festival in response to the call. Later, when his father wanted to go home, he had to send him off, but the work section leader didn't approve the leave. He thought of a way to find a replacement, but it was still not approved. Li Kezhen was angry and said he would leave even if he was absent from work. This happened just after the factory director went to the workshop, and Liu Erdun saw it all. He persuaded the work section leader to approve Li Kezhen's leave because he thought the replacement method was reasonable and would not affect production. At the same time, he criticized Li Kezhen for not being right to be absent from work to go home and throw a tantrum at the leader. Since then, Li Kezhen has become more active. At this time, a large group of male and female workers were talking and laughing as they smashed the cement bottom of the pulping tank. Li Kezhen swung the sledgehammer, dozens of times in one breath, clanging and sparking. Other workers were carrying out stone slag. When they saw the factory director standing at the door, they said:

"Hey, the factory director is here too, let's work together!"

So, he ran in, took the sledgehammer from Li Kezhen, and swung it dozens of times as well. He felt that this, one blow at a time, was like his heart and the hearts of the workers colliding together, clanging and clanging, without any ambiguity. He was extremely happy.

The workers cleaned the foundation of this abandoned factory building in order to respond to his call to install the large flat washing machine and restore it to production. This large flat washing machine was bought for 30,000 yuan in 1955. After using it for less than a year, there were frequent quality accidents, so it was stopped and left to rust. This time, when Director Liu went to the workshop, he saw that the machine was so rusted that he could scrape off a piece with one fingernail, and he felt extremely distressed. He wondered why he hadn't noticed it in the past? It hadn't been idle here for more than a year? ... So he walked around the machine. He walked around for most of the day. He touched it here, looked at it there, and figured out the whole machine. He thought: In the past, the quality was bad because the machine's baffle was large and it often made big folds; if we add a few rows of wooden shafts and run a double width, wouldn't that solve the problem? It can also increase production.

When the factory director was walking around the machine, the workers also noticed it! But they didn't know what the factory director was thinking, and they were all waiting. Old worker Liu Zhong also specially followed behind the factory director to see what the factory director would say. At this time, Liu Erdun turned his head and asked Liu Zhong:

"What do you say, can this large flat washing machine still be used?"

Liu Zhong smiled and looked at the factory director and said:

"Machines, there's no such thing as not being able to be used. It all depends on whether you use it or not."

Liu Erdun patted Liu Zhong's shoulder and said happily:

"That's right, machines, how can we not use them? Look, add wooden shafts and change to double width, what do you think?"

Liu Zhong gave a thumbs up:

"Brilliant, still our factory director!"

So they started drawing the design for改造 (transformation) the large flat washing machine on the spot. After drawing the design, they immediately went to find the maintenance worker. The maintenance worker looked at the design and said, "Okay, how much time does the factory director give?"

"Half a month, how about it?"

The maintenance worker smiled and replied:

"Ten days!"
Ten days later, Liu Erdun was on the night shift. The large flat washing machine had been modified. Afraid of danger, he decided to test the machine himself. At night, the hot vapor evaporated from the dyeing tank seemed thicker and denser, like fog. Even the electric lights were covered with a layer of water vapor, sweating. He felt a little anxious and feverish. He took off his clothes and blew under the air vent for a while, then stood on the operating platform, pulled the operating lever, and the machine turned smoothly.

Due to the vibration, pieces of rust fell from the large parts of the machine. He saw this clearly and sighed in his heart. The large flat washing machine, which had been discarded as waste not long ago, had become usable, and its daily output could be increased to 12,000 meters because of it. This was no small matter, and he couldn't help but feel excited.

But what excited him most was himself. He tried to recall the situation in the factory ten days ago... but it seemed like a long, long time had passed. Two weeks was like two years. Now everything had changed. In his heart, in the hearts of the workers, and even the air in the factory—although it was still in the wilderness, surrounded by paddy fields, which were now dry; the ground that had been cracked by the winter frost had healed because of the change of seasons. The air was hot and humid, carrying the breath of spring. Just like the steam in this workshop, carrying the slightly bitter fragrance of sulfur blue. He was very familiar with this smell and liked it; he now found it difficult to imagine how he would live without this smell. This smell was too important to him, he was both the director of the printing and dyeing factory and a worker in the dyeing workshop.

He was thinking, while paying attention to the problems existing in the machine during the test run. He recorded a total of thirteen problems. At this time, it was dawn. He turned off the car and walked back to his office, picked up a pen, and wrote down the thirteen problems on a piece of paper: safety cover, trolley, shaft, foot pedal... and attached a sentence at the end:

"Production section chief: Please solve these problems on the large flat washing machine today so that it can be put into production as soon as possible. —Liu Erdun"

After writing, he looked at it again, then carefully pressed the note under the glass of the desk, turned off the light, and walked towards the night shift collective dormitory.

    跟班生产的刘二囤
    本报特约记者　方纪
    刘二囤是河北任丘人。今年整三十岁，1947年参军，当了一年通讯员，就调到华北后勤部作工。当时只是用槐树籽染路西出的那种土布，染成草绿色做军装。在高阳时，还有染槽可以用；敌人一进攻，撤退到武强一带，便只能用大锅煮了。因此他虽然干了二年染布工人，并没有见过机器。
    1949年入城以后，先在北京，1950年调到天津，这才学会用机器染布。到1953年，他成了一个熟练的印染工人。就在这一年，他当了车间主任；1955年当了天津第二印染厂的副厂长。
    当了厂长，他觉得这是党的培养，只有好好干，才不辜负党教育自己的一片苦心。可是在那时候，他就开始感觉到，当厂长不如当工人干活痛快。当工人，能有多大劲使多大劲。染出来的新华牌蓝斜纹布，又光滑又明净。雪白的布在轴架上滚动，然后从染槽里爬上另一排轴架，就变了颜色。车间里热气蒸腾，带点苦涩的硫化蓝的香味，混合着工友们的温热的气息，使人连呼吸都觉得通畅。可是当了厂长，就不是这样了。整天坐在办公室里，烟气弥漫，鼻子和嗓子里，总觉发干。每天的工作，不是埋头在文件堆里，就是永远开不完的会。再不，就是抓着电话机和公司里吵嘴；直到嗓子哑了，手臂麻了，为一分钱的事，吵到筋疲力尽。
    起初他总是埋怨自己能力不够，怀疑是不是党提拔自己太快了。一个拾柴禾的穷孩子，才几年，就由工人当了厂长……于是他更加努力工作，常常几夜不睡。
    最使他苦恼的，越这样，他离工人越远。从前那些和他同车间，同工段，同看一台机器的工友们，很少见到他；见到他，和他说话，开口先称“刘厂长”，却背地里叫他“刘官”，他真是苦恼极了。有时候他想：去个蛋的！什么厂长不厂长，从前还不是一起干活，一样的工人……有时候他又想：既然当了厂长，就得像个厂长……于是他说话、做事，就更加谨慎。工人们看他这样，也就更少和他接近了。
    整风以后，工人们批评厂领导的三大主义。他是又痛快又不服气。痛快的是，工人们敢批评他了；不服气呢，他觉得自己辛辛苦苦，比当工人还苦，还累，谁愿意弄上一身坏主义？
    整风越深入，他越觉得自己应该回到车间去，和工人在一起。可是，他又觉得这不对，这像是逃避党交给自己的比当一个普通工人更重大的责任。他体验到这个矛盾，却不知怎样解决。
    起初，按照上级党委的指示，他和别的领导干部实行了定期参加体力劳动，每星期半天；每星期四还开工人座谈会，每星期六还接见工人。总之，他想用一切办法恢复像从前那样和工人的亲密关系。可是越这样，他越觉得自己和工人之间确实存在距离。他下车间去参加生产，站在机器前，从前他的手摸着机器，就像母亲的手摸着孩子，它的每一下呼吸，每一次脉搏的跳动，都能清楚地感觉到它的欢乐、它的要求和愿望。可是现在，机器对他变得疏远了，手摸上去冰冷冰冷的。他感觉到这个的时候，他简直吃惊起来。
    春节时候，总支书记老李邀请厂的领导干部一起谈心，学习湖北红安县办试验田的经验，还谈了红军团长当农民的文章。刘二囤这时开心起来，他想：我能不能来个半脱产呢，又当厂长，又当工人？
    他把这个意见在会上提出来。大家觉得好倒是好，可是困难也不少。比方说，全面工作怎样照顾，科室工作谁来管，集体领导还怎么形成？总之，困难好像是多极了。
    这时总支书记李章程说：
    “今年的质量指标定到99.5％，拿给工人一讨论，工人们就说了：‘头年还99.6％，今年倒99.5％了！定这样的指标，你们跟谁商量过？咱们建设社会主义，好比上梯子，总要一蹬比一蹬高。你们当领导的前面上，我们工人后面上。你们要站着不动，我们哪一天才能上到社会主义去！’你们看，工人们说这样的话，现在的事情不同了。”
    大伙儿一听，对呀！上梯子还能爬到半截不动了，挡着后面的路？不能，要爬，努力爬。下面的劲大，催着，上面就要爬得更快些。
    这样，总支委员会做了决定：干部下车间，去跟班生产。于是春节一过，刘二囤把厂里工作安排一下，2月28日，就正式上车当班了。
    刘厂长下车间跟班生产，起初并看不出什么两样。工人们也没有表示出特别的热情；有的还用怀疑而又期待的眼光看他。上轴架的时候，他要动手，工人就说：
    “我们来吧，厂长，这是重活。”
    到吃饭时候了，工人就说：
    “厂长，你先去吃，趁饭菜还热。”
    刘二囤听着这些话，又惭愧又感激。一肚子火辣辣的劲儿，就都使在机器上了。工人们一看，这厂长还真行，五年没有摸机器，技术也还没有丢下。虽然显得不太熟练，劲头儿可真不小。就也都暗暗使上了劲。
    这样，漂染车间染出来的布，就一天比一天多，也一天比一天好了。从日产六万二千公尺，增到六万四千公尺，六万五千公尺，六万六千公尺。质量呢，90％的人，都达到了百分之百。
    刘二囤站在写着每日产质量的黑板跟前，心里说不出的高兴，他想起过去他到车间来，也就是这样站站，看看，生产数字却今天这样，明天这样，后天还是这样，他那种“哑子吃黄连，有苦说不出”的滋味，和这情形比较起来，真是不知怎么说好。那时候，工人们叫他“黑板厂长”。他往这儿一站，自己就先心虚。可是现在，他理直气壮地站在黑板前面，看着生产指标天天上升。
    这时，有人在背后拍了一下他的肩膀。他回转头去，原来是老工人王念荣。
    “刘厂长，”他带笑说，“现在看黑板，可和从前不同了。”
    刘二囤脸红了一下。他觉得这个玩笑开的可不轻。但工人能够跟他开这样的玩笑了，而且意思是表扬他，心里又平静下来，但却想不出回答的话。
    “你看，”王念荣像根本没有察觉这些，继续说，“生产一天一变样。不用说你上车当班，就是你跟我们大伙儿一块儿站站，我们心里一痛快，手底下就使劲了。心里痛快好干活，是吗？”
    刘二囤点点头，觉得再不说话就不对了。于是开口道：
    “只要你们心里痛快，要我怎样我怎样。”
    说完，他的脸又红了一下。因为他没有想到，他一开口，就说出了自己的心事。这给工人们听起来，一定会奇怪的。他想再解释一下，王念荣却哈哈大笑起来。
    “我们要你怎样？不，老刘，只要你跟我们在一起，不干活，也行了。”
    刘二囤转过身来，红着脸，紧紧握住王念荣的手。
    从这天起，刘厂长就搬到工人宿舍来住。铺打在王念荣的旁边。头一天刚躺下去时，还觉得屋子有点冷。可是不一会儿，因为白天干活累了，就睡熟了。到半夜醒来，他觉得热了。伸手一摸，睡在自己身旁的王念荣不见了，他的被窝，却盖在自己身上。他坐起来，听了听，集体宿舍下面那间过去是日本扶轮纸厂安装浆池的车间里，叮噹乱响。“这是怎么回事？”他想起来白天的工人们宣布过要在那里安机器。便爬起来去看。里面亮着灯，青年工人李文林带头，老工人王念荣也在，还有李克振——这个人春节因为响应号召，没有回家。后来父亲要回家，他得去送，工段长却不准假。他想出替班的办法，还是不准。李克振火了，说旷工也得走。这事正发生在厂长下车间以后，刘二囤都看见了。就一面说服工段长，准李克振假；因为他想的替班办法很合理，不影响生产。一面又批评了李克振，不该为回家旷工，和领导耍脾气。从此以后，李克振变得积极起来。这时，一大堆男女工人，正说说笑笑的砸那个浆池子的水泥底。李克振抡着大锤，一气就是几十下，叮噹叮噹，火星直迸。别的工人们正往外抬石渣子，看见厂长站在门口，就说：
    “嘿，厂长也来了，一块干吧！”
    于是，他跑进去，接过李克振的大锤，一抡也是几十下。他觉得这样一下一下，就像他的心和工人们的心碰在一起，叮叮噹噹响，一点儿不带含糊的。他痛快极了。
    工人们清理这间废厂房的地基，就是为了响应他的号召，安装那台大平洗机，使它恢复生产。这台大平洗机1955年花三万块钱买来，用了不到一年，老出质量事故，就把它停下来，让它闲着生锈去了。这回刘厂长下车间，看到机器锈得不成样子，手指头一克就能克下一块来，心疼极了。他想想过去怎么就没有注意到？它不是在这儿闲了一年多？……于是他围着机器转起来。整整转了多半天。东摸摸，西看看，把整个机器都琢磨透了。他想：过去闹质量，是因为机器挡子大，老起大折子；要加几排木轴，走双幅，不就解决问题了？还能提高产量。
    厂长围着机器转的时候，工人们也注意到了！可是不知道厂长怎么想，都等待着。老工人刘忠还特地跟到厂长后边，看厂长怎么说。这时，刘二囤回过头来，问刘忠：
    “你说，这台大平洗机，还能用不能？”
    刘忠笑眯眯的瞅着厂长说：
    “机器嘛，还有不能用的。就看你用不用它。”
    刘二囤一拍刘忠的肩膀，高兴地说道：
    “对，机器嘛，咱能不用？你看，加木轴，改走双幅，怎么样？”
    刘忠把大拇指一翘：
    “高明，还是咱厂长！”
    于是他们就地画起改造大平洗机的图样来。画好图，立刻去找保全工。保全工看了看图样，说“行，厂长给多少时间？”
    “半个月，怎么样？”
    保全工笑了笑回答：
    “十天！”
      十天以后，刘二囤当夜班，大平洗机改装好了，他怕有危险，决定亲自试车。夜晚，染槽里蒸发出的热汽显得更浓更厚，像雾一样。连电灯也蒙上了一层水汽，流着汗。他心里有点焦躁，身上发热。脱掉衣服，在通风管下口吹了一会，便站上操纵台，扳动操纵杆，机器平稳地转动了。
    由于震动的缘故，机器大部件上的铁锈一块块落下来。这他看得清清楚楚，心里面叹了一口气。不久以前，还被当做废物弃置在那里的大平洗机，变得能用了，日产量因为它，能增加到一万二千公尺。这不是件小事，他不能不感到激动。
    但最使他激动的还是他自己。他试着回想十天以前厂里的情形……但却像过了很久很久。两个星期，就像两年。如今什么都变了。在他心里，和工人们心里，连同厂里的空气——虽然还是在旷野，四周围是稻田，如今还干着；冬天冻裂的地面，因为节令变换，已经愈合了。空气热烘烘的，带着潮润的春天的气息。就像这车间里的蒸汽，带着硫化蓝的略带苦涩的香味。他非常熟悉这种气味，喜欢它；他现在很难想像，离开这种气味，他怎样生活下去。这种气味对他太重要了，他是印染厂的厂长，又是漂染车间的工人。
    他想着，一面注意到试车中机器存在的毛病。他一共记下了十三个问题。这时，天亮了。他关了车，走回自己的办公室去，拿起笔来，在一张纸上写下了那十三个问题：安全罩，小车，轴，脚蹬……又在后面附上了一句话：
    “生产股长：请你就在今天解决大平洗机上的这些问题，好早日投入生产。——刘二囤”
    写完之后，他又看了一遍，然后仔细地把纸条压在办公桌的玻璃板底下，关了电灯，向夜班集体宿舍走去。
