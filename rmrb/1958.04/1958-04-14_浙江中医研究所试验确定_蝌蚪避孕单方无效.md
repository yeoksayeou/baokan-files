    Zhejiang Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine Experimentally Confirms
    Tadpole Contraceptive Single Formula Ineffective

    (Our dispatch) The tadpole contraceptive single formula, after experiments by the Physiological Laboratory of the Zhejiang Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been preliminarily determined to be ineffective.

    The subjects selected for the tadpole contraceptive experiment by the Zhejiang Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine were 65 women from the joint state-private Hangzhou Department Store, the Hangzhou Cotton Textile Factory, and urban residents of Hangzhou, who had given birth to three or more children, aged between twenty-five and forty, and who voluntarily took the tadpoles. The method of swallowing tadpoles was based on the method introduced by Doctor Ye Xichun, which involved swallowing them three to five days after the women's menstrual period. The dosage was 24 on the first day and 20 on the second day. According to surveys of the women after swallowing the tadpoles, the contraceptive effect was: of the 42 female workers at the Hangzhou Cotton Textile Factory who swallowed tadpoles from April 5 to May 4 of last year, 18 were pregnant by August, accounting for 43% of the total number of people tested in the factory; among the women in Hangzhou's urban areas who swallowed tadpoles for contraception, two became pregnant within a month; the remaining women participating in the experiment, seeing that tadpole contraception was ineffective, switched to artificial methods of contraception one after another.

    The Zhejiang Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine also conducted animal tadpole contraception experiments, selecting fifteen white mice with reproductive capacity, isolating males and females for half a month to prove that they were not pregnant. The female mice were divided into five groups with three female mice in each cage. Two cages of mice were fed one tadpole per mouse per day for ten consecutive days, after which one male mouse was placed in each cage. The other three cages of female mice were fed tadpoles for twenty consecutive days, after which one male mouse was placed in each cage. From April 13 to June 21 of last year, twelve of the fifteen female mice in the five cages that ate tadpoles became pregnant and gave birth to pups. Among the other three non-pregnant female mice, two were not pregnant because their ovaries were not fully developed, and the reason for the other one is still unknown.

    In addition, according to tests by the Physiological Laboratory of the Zhejiang Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine on live tadpoles growing in ponds and ditches in the suburbs of Hangzhou, the tadpoles' gastrointestinal tracts do indeed contain parasite eggs such as roundworms.

    浙江中医研究所试验确定
    蝌蚪避孕单方无效
    本报讯　蝌蚪避孕单方，经浙江省中医研究所生理实验室试验，已初步确定无效。
    浙江省中医研究所蝌蚪避孕试验选择的对象，有公私合营杭州市百货公司和杭州棉纺织厂、杭州市城区居民，曾生育子女三胎以上，年龄在二十五岁至四十岁，自愿服用的妇女六十五人。吞服蝌蚪的方法，是根据叶熙春大夫所介绍的在妇女月经期以后三至五天吞服。服用量，第一天先吞二十四个，第二天再吞二十个。据各妇女吞服蝌蚪后的调查，避孕效果：杭州棉纺织厂自去年4月5日至5月4日吞服蝌蚪的女工四十二人，到8月，已有十八人怀孕，占该厂试验总人数的43％，杭州市城区居民吞服蝌蚪避孕的妇女中有一个月即怀孕的妇女二人；其余参加试验的妇女，因见蝌蚪避孕无效，都先后采取改用人工方法避孕。
    浙江省中医研究所又作了动物蝌蚪避孕试验，他们选择有生殖能力的小白鼠十五只，雌雄隔离半个月，证明其确未怀孕后，将雌鼠平分为五组每笼关雌鼠三只。有两笼老鼠每天每鼠吃一个蝌蚪，连吃十天以后，每笼放进一只雄鼠，另外三笼雌鼠连吃二十天蝌蚪后，各放进一只雄鼠。这个试验自去年4月13日起到6月21日止，吃蝌蚪的五笼十五只雌鼠有十二只怀孕生仔，其它未怀孕的三只雌鼠中，两只是因卵巢未发育完全而未孕，一只原因尚不明。
    此外，据浙江中医研究所生理实验室对生长在杭州市郊池塘、河沟的活蝌蚪检查证明：蝌蚪的肠胃道内确有蛔虫等寄生虫卵存在。
