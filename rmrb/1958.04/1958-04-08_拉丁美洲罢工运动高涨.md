    Rising Strike Movements in Latin America
    In 1957, Latin American countries experienced unprecedentedly large-scale strike movements. Millions of people in different occupations participated in strike struggles demanding higher wages and improved working conditions.
    The strike movement has continued into this year. The wave of strikes has spread to Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Ecuador, and other countries. Gold miners in Colombia, municipal employees in Ecuador, construction workers in Argentina, and meatpacking workers in Uruguay have all gone on strike successively.
    The strike by Argentine bank employees lasted for ten weeks, finally forcing the government to make concessions. Participants received a temporary subsidy of 450 pesos, an advance payment of one month's salary, and the government was forced to guarantee the resumption of negotiations with the union on wage increases.
    In early March, the Argentine railway workers' strike also achieved initial victory. Workers' wages were increased by 400 pesos per month. The strike struggle in Argentina has been very fierce. The strike that began on September 17 last year involved 45,000 telecommunications and broadcasting employees. During the strike, domestic and international telecommunications were mainly maintained by the military. On September 27, a general strike broke out, with four million people participating. On October 22, another general strike broke out. More than sixty national trade union organizations participated in this general strike. The oil, textile, woodworking, and leather industries were almost completely shut down. Four-fifths of the country's major railway lines were paralyzed.
    In those days, Buenos Aires was almost a military camp. A United Press reporter described the scene at the time: "...Every tram in Buenos Aires was filled with soldiers and sailors. They were fully armed, with bayonets fixed on their rifles. Federal police guarded every subway station, escorting every train in Buenos Aires."
    On March 11 this year, tin miners in Bolivia began a strike. American newspapers admitted that the strike was actually a protest against the Bolivian "economic stabilization" plan formulated by American experts, which was based on "freezing" workers' wages.
    In the first ten months of last year alone, there were 292 strikes in Bolivia. Uruguay had about 300 strikes. In 1957, more than one million working people in Brazil participated in the struggle for higher wages.
    The working people of Chile also launched fierce strike struggles. At the end of December last year, 50,000 construction workers, 26,000 railway workers, 36,000 medical workers, 30,000 teachers, 35,000 state employees, 150,000 private enterprise employees, oil workers, leather production workers, nitrate workers, miners, and workers in many other industries went on strike.
    The main reason for the rising strike movement in Latin American countries is the increasingly deteriorating living conditions of the working people.
    According to official statistics, from September 1955 to December 1957, the cost of living in Argentina increased by 55%, of which food prices increased by 72%.
    According to Latin American newspaper reports, there are many unemployed people in Latin American countries. In 1957, Chile had 170,000 unemployed. Even a small country like Uruguay had 70,000 unemployed. In Brazil's largest industrial center, Sao Paulo, the number of unemployed reached more than 100,000 in October last year.
    Under these circumstances, the main demands of the strikers are to increase wages, reduce prices, and improve working conditions. At the same time, political demands were also raised during the strike movement: to protect democracy and trade union freedom, abolish reactionary laws, and ease international tensions.
    The widespread mass general strikes played a decisive role in the struggle to overthrow the dictatorships in Colombia and Venezuela. In Cuba, the strike movement against the Batista regime has persisted to this day.

### 拉丁美洲罢工运动高涨

    拉丁美洲罢工运动高涨
    在1957年，拉丁美洲国家爆发了规模空前壮大的罢工运动。数百万不同职业的人参加了要求提高工资和改善劳动条件的罢工斗争。
    罢工运动一直持续到今年。罢工的浪潮蔓延到阿根廷、乌拉圭、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔以及其他一些国家。哥伦比亚的金矿工人、厄瓜多尔的市政机关职工、阿根廷的建筑工人和乌拉圭的肉类冷藏工人先后举行了罢工。
    阿根廷银行职工的罢工持续了十个星期之久，最后终于迫使政府作了让步。参加罢工的人获得了四百五十比索的临时补助金，提前领取一个月的工资，政府被迫保证同工会恢复关于提高工资的谈判。
    3月初，阿根廷铁路职工的罢工也获得了初步胜利。职工的工资每月提高了四百比索。阿根廷的罢工斗争是非常激烈的。去年9月17日开始的罢工，有四万五千名电信及广播职工参加。在罢工期间，国内和国际间的电信联系主要是靠军队的力量维持。9月27日又爆发了总罢工，参加罢工的人数达四百万人。10月22日爆发了另一次总罢工。参加这次总罢工的有全国六十多个工会组织。石油、纺织、木材加工和皮革等工业几乎完全停工。国内六分之四的主要铁路干线陷于瘫痪状态。
    在那些日子里，布宜诺斯艾利斯几乎成了一座兵营。合众社记者这样描写当时的景况：“……布宜诺斯艾利斯的每一列电车都装满了士兵和水兵。他们全副武装，步枪装上了刺刀。联邦警察警卫着地下铁道的每一个站口，押送布宜诺斯艾利斯的每一列火车。”
    今年3月11日，玻利维亚的锡矿工人开始了罢工。美国报刊承认，这次罢工实际上是反对美国专家们所拟定的玻利维亚的“经济稳定”计划，这个计划是建立在“冻结”工人工资的基础上的。
    仅在去年头十个月中，玻利维亚就发生了二百九十二起罢工。乌拉圭发生了约三百起罢工。1957年，巴西有一百多万劳动人民参加了要求提高工资的斗争。
    智利的劳动人民也展开了激烈的罢工斗争。去年12月底，有五万名建筑工人、二万六千名铁路工人、三万六千名医务工作者、三万名教师、三万五千名国家机关职工、十五万名私人企业职工、石油工人、皮革生产工人、硝石工人、矿工以及其他许多工业部门的劳动人民举行了罢工。
    劳动人民生活状况的日益恶化，是拉丁美洲国家罢工运动高涨的主要原因。
    根据官方的统计材料，从1955年9月到1957年12月，阿根廷的生活指数提高了55％，其中食品价格提高了72％。
    根据拉丁美洲报刊的报道，拉丁美洲各国的失业人数很多。1957年，智利的失业者达十七万人。像乌拉圭这样的小国，也有七万人失业。巴西最大的工业中心圣保罗的失业人数，在去年10月达十万多人。
    在这种情况下，罢工者的主要要求是提高工资、降低物价和改善劳动条件。同时，在罢工运动的过程中也提出了政治方面的要求：保护民主和工会自由，废除反动法律，缓和国际紧张局势。
    群众性广泛的总罢工，在推翻哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉的独裁制度的斗争中起了决定性的作用。在古巴，反对巴蒂斯塔制度的罢工运动，一直坚持到现在。
