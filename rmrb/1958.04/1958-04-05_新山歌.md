    New Folk Songs
    The cannon's roar shakes the sky,
    Thousand-year-old rocks move their homes,
    The clear spring is like a bolt of white cotton cloth,
    Hanging from the sky to the level plain.
              (Yun County, Hubei)
    Water conservancy brings many benefits,
    Green water smiles as it climbs the mountain slopes,
    Green mountains, fragrant rice, the water mill sings,
    Life is getting happier and happier.
              (Jun County, Hubei)
    Today a hump,
    Tomorrow eliminate the hump,
    The day after tomorrow, look again,
    A channel cut through the mountain.
              (Jun County, Hubei)
    The reservoir is built like a city wall,
    The irrigation canal winds for ten miles,
    No matter if there's a drought and no rain,
    The commune members are their own Dragon Kings.
              (Ji'an, Jiangxi)
    The gong beats the sun to be early,
    The gas lamp rivals the moon in brightness,
    The crowd compares to the stars in number,
    With one heart to conquer mountains and rivers.
              (Yiwu, Zhejiang)
    Great harvest in the lowlands, autumn every month of the year,
    First and second month manage fish, third and fourth month lotus roots,
    Fifth and sixth month harvest bulrush and wheat,
    In July pull hemp and harvest water chestnuts,
    September and October have the great autumn harvest,
    In November, harvest reeds.
    In December, the fishing industry raises its head again
            (Wen'an, Hebei)
    A ferry boat floats on the stream in Dabie Mountain,
    Several miles of green waves roll;
    On both banks of the river, the soil is turned,
    River beach waterlogged land becomes good farmland.
            (Shangcheng, Henan)

    新山歌
    火炮一声震动天，
    千年岩石把家搬，
    清泉像匹白棉布，
    天上挂到地平川。
              （湖北郧县）
    兴修水利好处多，
    绿水笑着上山坡，
    山青稻香水磨响，
    日子越来越快活。
              （湖北均县）
    今天一个凸，
    明天把凸消，
    后天再来看，
    劈山一道槽。
              （湖北均县）
    水库筑得像城墙，
    水圳弯弯十里长，
    任它天旱不下雨，
    社员自己当龙王。
              （江西吉安）
    锣声和太阳比早，
    汽灯和月亮比明，
    人群和星星比多，
    一心要征服山河。
              （浙江义乌）
    洼地大丰收，一年月月秋，
    一二月治鱼三四月藕，
    五六月打蒲又麦收，
    七月里拔麻收菱角，
    九十月里过大秋，
    十一月里正打苇。
    十二月鱼业又抬头
            （河北文安）
    大别山涧漂渡船，
    数里碧绿波浪翻；
    沿河两岸土翻身，
    河滩涝地变良田。
            （河南商城）
