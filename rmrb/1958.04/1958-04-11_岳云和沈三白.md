In the previous period of great airing of views, it goes without saying that right-wingers massively attacked the leadership of our Party. But at that time, some people also accused us of being "fond of greatness and eager for success," and even in the current Great Leap Forward, there are still such accusations.

Speaking of being "fond of greatness and eager for success," Yue Yun in "Yue Family Village" is probably the most "fond of greatness and eager for success" person. At a young age, he secretly practiced martial arts behind his mother's back, "cherishing the ambition to serve the country and protect the land," opening his mouth with "soaring spirit piercing the heavens," and closing it with "never ceasing until the Jin people are destroyed." It seems that he would make some people laugh. However, thanks to Yue Yun's "fondness of greatness and eagerness for success," he developed excellent martial arts skills, which repelled the Jin soldiers and defended Yue Family Village. What's wrong with Yue Yun's "fondness of greatness and eagerness for success"? For example, Shen Sanbai, who wrote "Six Records of a Floating Life," is probably the least "fond of greatness and eager for success" person. He indulged in the pleasures of the boudoir throughout his life, appreciating the moon and flowers with his wife, and thought that "there is no greater joy in the world than this." After stumbling a few times on the road of life, even his wife died in poverty and illness, yet he still had no outcry, but realized that "a woman without talent is virtuous, truly a timeless saying." Like such a man, first a leisured person from a "family of officials," and later a slave to a life of resignation, if he hadn't written "Six Records of a Floating Life" in his later years, leaving a name behind, no one would have known that there had ever been such a person in the world, let alone talk about being "fond of greatness and eager for success."

In the old society, "Six Records of a Floating Life" was also popular for a while. Some were adapted for the stage, and some were made into movies. The performers may have favored the sentiments of "boudoir pleasures" and sympathized with the sorrow of "records of frustration," but the audience gained an undesirable lesson: "Contentment brings happiness. Life is originally a tragedy; being able to cook a pot of porridge with a loved one is already fortunate, why be demanding?" After liberation, "Six Records of a Floating Life" disappeared. This is also inevitable. Although "Records of Frustration" also reflected some of the coldness of human relationships in the old society, Shen Sanbai's spirit of slavery was after all incompatible with the true qualities of the working people. On the other hand, "Yue Family Village" still often appears on the stage, and whenever the young hero Yue Yun appears, he always pleases the audience. The reason for this is probably that Yue Yun's spirit of "fondness of greatness and eagerness for success" still inspires people to forge ahead!

The spirit of Communists has nothing in common with the spirit of Shen Sanbai, but it has something in common with the spirit of Yue Yun; but it is also thousands of times higher than the spirit of Yue Yun. Communists take the liberation of all mankind as their own responsibility, and this cannot but be "fond of greatness." If you are not fond of the greatness of socialism and communism, and do not take the liberation of all mankind as your own responsibility, then what kind of Communist are you? Communists believe that the cause of communism will surely be victorious throughout the world, and they are full of confidence and strive unceasingly for this, so they must "delight in achievement." If you do not delight in the achievements of socialism and communism, and do not strive to the end for the cause of communism, then what kind of Communist are you?

It can be seen that "fondness of greatness and eagerness for success" is not a bad thing, but also a manifestation of revolutionary enthusiasm and progressive spirit. Of course, fondness for the greatness of individualism and delight in the achievements of individualism should be opposed. This goes without saying.

    岳云和沈三白

    在前一时期的大鸣大放中，右派分子大肆攻击我们党的领导，那是不用说了。但是当时还有一些人指责我们为“好大喜功”的，甚至在当前的大跃进中，也还有这类指责。
    说到“好大喜功”，“岳家庄”里的岳云恐怕算得上是最“好大喜功”的人了。他小小的年纪，瞒着母亲暗地里演习武艺，“怀揣着报国志要把江山保定”，开口“凌云气概贯斗牛”，闭口“不灭金人誓不休”，看来会使一些人失笑。然而，也多亏岳云“好大喜功”，练就了一身武艺，才杀退了金兵，保卫了岳家庄。这岳云的“好大喜功”又有什么不好呢？又比如写“浮生六记”的沈三白，恐怕可算是最不“好大喜功”的人了。他一生沉湎于闺房乐趣之中，同老婆品月评花，就认为“人间之乐无过于此矣”，待到在生活的道路上栽了几个跟斗，连老婆也贫病而死，却仍无半声呐喊，反领悟到“女子无才便是德，真千古至言也”。像这样一个先是“衣冠之家”的闲人，后是逆来顺受的生活的奴隶，若不是晚年写了本“浮生六记”，留下了名姓，那是谁也不知道世上曾有这么一个人的，当然更谈不上“好大喜功”了。
    旧社会里，“浮生六记”也曾时兴过一阵。有搬上舞台的，有拍成电影的。演戏的，也许是偏爱“闺房记乐”的情趣，同情“坎坷记愁”的忧伤；看戏的却得到一条要不得的教训：“知足常乐。人生原是悲剧，能同爱人煮一锅粥喝已是万幸，何必苛求？”解放后，“浮生六记”绝迹了。这也是必然的。“坎坷记愁”虽然也反映了一些旧社会里的人情冷暖，但沈三白的奴隶精神同劳动人民的本色毕竟是格格不入的。倒是“岳家庄”还常在舞台上出现，每当少年英雄岳云登场，总是惹观众喜欢的。这原因，恐怕是岳云“好大喜功”的精神，还是激人奋发上进的缘故吧！
    共产党人的精神同沈三白的精神毫无共同之处，同岳云的精神却有些相通；但又比岳云的精神高了千万倍。共产党人以解放全人类为己任，这就不能不“好大”。不好社会主义、共产主义之大，不以解放全人类为己任，那还叫什么共产党呢？共产党人相信共产主义事业一定会在全世界取得胜利，并且信心百倍地为此而奋斗不息，这就一定“喜功”。不喜社会主义、共产主义之功，不为共产主义事业奋斗到底，那又叫什么共产党呢？
    可见，“好大喜功”非但不是坏事，而且还是革命干劲和促进精神的表现。当然，好个人主义之大、喜个人主义之功，应该反对。这是不在话下的。
