    Factory Welcomes Spring Song
    Zheng Ling, Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory
　　Spring writes poetry with novel language on our chimneys, it doesn't follow the established grammar, the language is very novel. But I understand its theme and rhythm, it writes of "China in a Great Leap Forward." The grammar it uses is the workers' vigorous drive.
    Masterpiece by the Furnace
　　The spring sun ignites the furnace fire, and the old blacksmith writes a song to welcome the spring by the furnace. What he writes is very rich, there is no paper on earth big enough to print it. Only let this magnificent century echo the sound of his hammer.

    工厂迎春歌
    株洲机车车辆修理厂　郑玲
　　新奇的语言春天在我们的烟囱上写诗，它不按照固有的文法，语言非常新奇。可是我懂得它的主题和音韵，它写的是“中国在跃进”。它所依据的文法，是工人们朝气蓬勃的干劲。
    炉边杰作春阳点燃了炉火，老铁匠在炉边写下了迎春之歌。他写的十分丰盛，地球上没有这样大的纸张来印。只有让这雄伟的世纪，响应他铁锤的回声。
    新婚的花小车工要迎娶新娘回家，他去为她寻觅一束鲜花，所有的花儿都容易雕零，没有一种能象征永恒的爱情。小伙子啊！就献上你生产牌上的红箭头吧！因为它一直在上升。
