Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, April 15th. An electronic strain gauge type pressure weighing device has recently been successfully designed and trial-produced by the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    This electronic scale is small in size and requires very little steel to manufacture. It can replace old-fashioned track scales and other large scales that consume a large amount of steel. It is very convenient to use this electronic scale to measure the weight of giant objects. For example, when measuring the total weight of a train, simply install the pressure weighing device under the track, and the reading table of the electronic strain gauge will indicate the weight as the train passes.

    The trial production of this weighing device was a research activity outside the planned research projects of the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. In order to better integrate scientific research with production, the researchers of the institute took the initiative to contact the Changchun Metrology Factory and learned that the manufacture of large-scale weighing equipment required a large amount of steel. Therefore, they used their spare time to refer to various documents and worked with workers to research and successfully trial-produce this electronic strain gauge type pressure weighing device. Experiments have proved that its sensitivity is very high.

    The Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering is now continuing to manufacture several more units according to this design, and is also training a group of technical personnel through trial production, and then transferring it to the industrial sector for production.

    电子测重器试制成功
    新华社长春15日电　一种电子应变仪式压力测重器在中国科学院机械电机研究所最近设计试制成功。
    这种电子衡器体积很小，制造所需的钢材也很少，可以代替旧式的花费大量钢材制造的轨道衡和其他大型衡器。使用这种电子衡器来衡量巨型物体重量十分方便。例如在衡量火车全重时，只要把压力测重器装在轨道下面，在火车经过的同时，电子应变仪的读数表就会把重量指示出来。
    试制这种测重器是机械电机研究所计划研究项目以外的一种研究活动。研究所的研究人员为了要使科学研究同生产结合得更好，曾经主动和长春度量衡厂联系，并了解到度量衡厂制造大型衡器需要耗费大量钢材。于是他们利用业余时间，参考了各种文献，同工人一起研究试制成功这种电子应变仪式压力测重器。经试验证明，它的灵敏度很高。
    机械电机研究所现在正按照这种设计继续制造几台，并通过试制培养一批技术力量，然后移交工业部门生产。
