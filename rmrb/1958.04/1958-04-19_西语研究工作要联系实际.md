    Western Language Research Should Be Linked to Reality

    The "Western Languages" quarterly has already published four issues. The articles published in this magazine and the "Western Languages Research Briefs" roughly reflect the current state of Western language research in our country. In recent years, Western language workers have done a lot of work in teaching, translation, language and literature research, and have also compiled many practical and useful books and articles. However, the phenomenon of being out of touch with reality and "valuing the past over the present" is still very serious.

    The purpose of learning and using Western languages is mainly to enable us to directly, or through translation, have friendly exchanges and mutual understanding with the people of Western countries; secondly, to enable us to read or translate Western books and newspapers; and thirdly, to use languages understood by Western people to tell the story of our people's experiences and lessons learned in revolution and construction, so that they can better understand us. The main task of Western language researchers should be to improve the efficiency of the above three aspects: through scientific experiments and summaries, to help those who have the conditions and needs to learn and use Western languages more, faster, better, and more economically.

    Western language researchers and "Western Languages" have also done some work in these areas. However, we have seen many such "research" topics: "Adjectives in Chaucer's Poetry," "A Linguistic Study of Natural Descriptions in Hardy's 'The Woodlanders'," etc. Or some literary research that is keen on "early" works, as if the more important thing is not a writer's representative works from their mature period: "A Study of Dickens' Three Early Works," "Goethe's Youth," "The Reflection of Bernard Shaw's Political Thought in His Early Works," etc.

    I hope that the strength of Western language researchers can be organized to further connect with reality, give full play to their enthusiasm, and make their efforts better serve our country's socialist construction.

### 西语研究工作要联系实际

    西语研究工作要联系实际
    “西方语文”季刊已经出刊四期了。这个杂志登载的文章以及“西方语文科研简讯”大体上反映了我国目前西语研究工作的状况。西语工作者近年在教学、翻译、语言和文学研究方面做了不少工作，也编写了不少切实有用的书籍和文章。可是脱离实际、“厚古薄今”的现象仍很严重。
    学习和使用西方语文的目的主要是使我们能够直接地，或者通过翻译，和西方各国人民友好来往，互相了解；其次是使我们能够阅读或翻译西方书报；第三是把我国人民革命和建设中的经历和经验用西方人民懂得的语言讲述出来，使他们能更好地了解我们。西语研究者的任务主要应该是提高上述三方面的效率：通过科学的试验和总结，帮助有这个条件和需要的人能够多、快、好、省地学习和使用西方语文。
    西语研究者和“西方语文”在这些方面也做了一些工作。但我们却看到很多这样的“研究”题目：“乔叟诗中的形容词”、“哈代‘林地的人们’中自然描写的语言研究”等。或者这样一些热中于“早期”的文学研究，似乎更重要的并不是一个作家成熟时期的代表作：“狄更斯的三部早期创作研究”、“歌德的青年时期”、“萧伯纳的政治思想在其早期作品中的反映”等。
    我希望能够把西语研究工作者这支力量组织起来，进一步联系实际，发挥干劲，使他们的努力更好地为我国的社会主义建设服务。
