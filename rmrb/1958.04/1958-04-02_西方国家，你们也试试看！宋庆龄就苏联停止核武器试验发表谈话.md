    Western Countries, Why Don't You Give It a Try Too!
    Soong Ching Ling Issues Statement on Soviet Union Halting Nuclear Weapons Testing
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 1st. Renowned peace advocate Soong Ching Ling issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters regarding the Soviet Union's decision to halt nuclear weapons testing, the full text of which is as follows:
    I would like to join the world in unanimously expressing heartfelt appreciation and cheers for the Soviet Union's announcement of a unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons explosion tests.
    This is a great manifestation of the firm will of the Soviet Union, and in fact the entire socialist camp, to strive for peace and the sincere desire to seek peaceful coexistence. It is a salute to all peace-loving forces everywhere, demonstrating the Soviet Union's confidence in them; this is a new and great encouragement to these forces. Through the concerted action of these forces, international tensions can be eased, and war can be completely avoided.
    With the issuance of this statement by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union and all peace-minded people are saying to the Western countries: "Why don't you give it a try too!" The representatives of these countries have been doing everything possible to evade high-level talks that could promote disarmament and cause the West to abandon the "Cold War" policy. Now, they have encountered this new development. They can no longer find any excuse to refuse to engage in serious discussions and refuse to take concrete steps to foster trust between countries.
    The people of the world disapprove of their "lukewarm" attitude towards the Soviet Union's many peace initiatives, including this most recent one. Their attempt to portray this action as "nothing new" is something we cannot agree with. This is an unprecedented, far-reaching step with tremendous implications, and we demand that Western countries take similar actions immediately. We demand the removal of their numerous military bases on foreign territories and the cessation of the continuous flights carrying atomic bombs—actions that are not only provocative but also directly threaten the safety of even the people of the Western countries themselves.
    Only genuine efforts on both sides can create a completely new atmosphere, so that the people of all countries can be free from worry and devote themselves to the constantly progressing work of humanity, building a better life for all. The Soviet Union has once again taken a bold initiative, and we can only say to the Western countries once again: "Why don't you give it a try too!"

### 西方国家，你们也试试看！宋庆龄就苏联停止核武器试验发表谈话

    西方国家，你们也试试看！
    宋庆龄就苏联停止核武器试验发表谈话
    新华社上海1日电　著名和平人士宋庆龄就苏联决定停止核武器试验向新华社记者发表谈话，全文如下：
    我想同全世界一道同声对苏联宣布单方面停止核武器爆炸试验一举表示衷心的赞许和欢呼。
    这是苏联，事实上也是世界整个社会主义阵营，所具有的争取和平的坚强意志和谋求和平共处的真诚愿望的伟大表现。这是对一切地方爱好和平的力量的敬礼，显示了苏联对他们的信心；这是对于这些力量的一种新的巨大鼓舞。通过这些力量的一致行动，国际紧张局势是能得到缓和，战争是能完全避免的。
    随着苏联这一声明的发表，苏联和所有具有和平思想的人都在对西方国家说：“你们也试试看！”这些国家的代表人物一直在千方百计地尽力规避有可能促成裁军、促使西方放弃“冷战”政策的高级会谈。现在，他们遇到了这种新的发展。他们再也拿不出什么借口来拒绝进行认真的讨论，拒绝采取具体的步骤来培养各国之间的信任。
    世界各国人民对于他们对苏联的许多和平行动中的最近这个行动“不热心”的态度是不以为然的。他们企图把这个行动说成是“没有什么新东西”，我们是不能赞同的。这是一个史无前例的、意义深远的具有巨大影响的步骤，我们要求西方国家立即采取类似的行动。我们要求撤除他们在外国领土上的许许多多军事基地和停止不断携带原子弹飞行的行动——这种行动不仅是挑衅性的，而且还直接威胁甚至是西方国家自己的人民的安全。
    只有双方作出真诚努力，才能够创造出全新的气氛，从而使各国人民可以放心无虑，使他们能够致力于不断进步的人类的工作，为所有人建设美好的生活。苏联再度采取了勇敢的主动行动，我们也只有再一次向西方国家说：“你们也试试看！”
