Summarizing and Promoting Old Revolutionary Base Area School Management Experience
中共陕西省委宣传部邀集西安教育界人士座谈

    According to the Shaanxi Daily, the Propaganda Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China invited education figures from Xi'an on the morning of April 10 to discuss how to summarize and promote the experience of running schools in old revolutionary base areas. Most of the participants had worked in education in the old revolutionary base areas for many years and had rich experience in running schools. Liu Zeru, President of Xi'an Normal College, said: "Everyone knows that the old revolutionary base areas have a wealth of experience in education, but unfortunately, we have not summarized and promoted it well in the past." He suggested that everyone should pay attention to this work, and the first thing to do now is to strengthen the collection, sorting and research of materials. When studying materials, we should start with the study of specific materials and summarize theories from practice. Liu Duanfen, Vice President of Northwest University, said that the old revolutionary base areas have a lot of experience in running schools diligently and thriftily and handling teacher-student relationships, such as students building cave dwellings themselves, collecting firewood, farming, and teachers and students eating, living, and working together. These good experiences and good traditions should be inherited and greatly developed. Li Mian, Vice President of Xi'an Normal College, Wang Yunfeng, Principal of the Russian College, Guo Shengwu, Dean of Northwest University, Zhang Yue, Director of the Xi'an Municipal Education Bureau, and more than a dozen other people also spoke at the symposium. They all believed that the school education in the old revolutionary base areas had accumulated a lot of experience in both teaching content and teaching methods, and that summarizing these experiences would be of great benefit to enriching and improving future school teaching work.
    In order to strengthen this research work, the attendees also exchanged views on the establishment of an education society and its main tasks.

    总结和推广老区办学经验
    中共陕西省委宣传部邀集西安教育界人士座谈
    本报讯　据陕西日报报道：中共陕西省委宣传部于4月10日上午，邀集西安教育界人士，就如何总结和推广老区办学经验等问题进行了座谈。参加座谈会的人大部分曾在老区办过多年教育，有丰富的办学经验。西安师范学院院长刘泽如说：老区在教育工作上有许多丰富的经验，这是谁都知道的，可惜，我们过去没有很好地总结它、推广它。他建议大家都来重视这项工作，目前首先应加强资料的搜集和整理研究工作。在研究资料时，要从研究具体材料开始，从实际中总结出理论。西北大学副校长刘端棻说，老区在勤俭办学和处理师生关系等方面有不少经验，如学生自己打窑洞、打柴、种地生产以及师生同吃、同住、同劳动等等。这些好经验和好传统，是应当继承和大大发扬的。在座谈会上相继发言的还有：西安师范学院副院长李绵、俄专校长王云风、西大教务长郭绳武、西安市教育局局长张越等十余人。他们都认为，老区的学校教育，不论在教学内容和教学方法上，都积累了许多经验，总结这些经验，对充实和提高今后学校教学工作将有重大的好处。
    为了加强这项研究工作，出席座谈会的人还就成立教育学会及其主要任务，交换了意见。
