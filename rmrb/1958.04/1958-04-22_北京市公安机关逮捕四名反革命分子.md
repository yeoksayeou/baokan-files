Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: With the active assistance of the people, the Beijing Public Security organs recently arrested four counter-revolutionaries according to law. They are Jia Wenbo, a special agent sent by the Chiang Kai-shek group; Zheng Shiyi, a hidden agent; Liu Wanzhong, a puppet township chief with four lives on his hands; and Li Yinglin, a released convict undergoing labor reform who shielded Jia Wenbo.

After Jia Wenbo sneaked into Beijing last June, he was under the surveillance and surrounded by the people. In hotels, on the streets, and on the train to Taiyuan, people noticed his suspicious behavior. Seven or eight people visited the public security organs or wrote letters to report him. After investigation, it was confirmed that Jia Wenbo had served as a lieutenant colonel staff officer for Yan Xishan and the chief of the staff section of the puppet Tianjin Garrison Command before liberation. After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, he fled to Guangzhou, where he accepted a mission from Yan Xishan. In 1950, he sneaked back into Beijing and secretly organized the "Ministry of National Defense Pingjin Military and Political Special Envoy Office," developing special agents. Soon after, he fled to Hong Kong, where he met with a special agent leader of the Kuomintang "Intelligence Bureau" and suggested to this agent leader that he return to the mainland to organize a "Anti-Communist and Anti-Russian National Salvation Work Group," and also requested the agent leader to provide him with activity funds. At the same time, he also established relationships with the American consulate in Hong Kong and other Chiang Kai-shek group's secret service organs. After he accepted a mission from the secret service organ and came to Beijing last June, he tried to win over old relationships everywhere and attempted to collect intelligence on our important factories and warehouses. However, those he tried to win over noticed his conspiracy and reported him to the public security organs. Jia Wenbo also sent intelligence to the Hong Kong secret service organ in code. After carrying out a series of counter-revolutionary activities, this special agent planned to return to Hong Kong to claim credit and receive rewards, and then return to the mainland to carry out even greater conspiracies. However, before he was about to board the train to escape the mainland, the Beijing Public Security organs arrested him. At the same time as Jia Wenbo was arrested, Li Yinglin, who had shielded Jia Wenbo, was also arrested. Li had participated in the "Ministry of National Defense Pingjin Military and Political Special Envoy Office" organized by Jia Wenbo in 1950. He was subjected to labor reform by the government. After being released, he still refused to repent and shielded Jia Wenbo.

The counter-revolutionary Liu Wanzhong was captured by the public security organs with the assistance of He Shaobin, a worker at the Xinhua Printing Factory. After learning that Liu Wanzhong had been a puppet township chief in Sanhe County and was now working in Beijing but did not dare to go home, He Shaobin estimated that Liu must have committed serious crimes. He tried to find out his address and reported his findings and Liu Wanzhong's whereabouts to the public security organs. After investigation by the public security organs, it was confirmed that Liu Wanzhong had killed four revolutionary cadres in 1946. After liberation, he impersonated a dead person's name and wandered in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia, and was arrested according to law.

The hidden agent Zheng Shiyi accepted a hidden mission assigned by the Kuomintang "Central Unification" secret service organ in 1948. After liberation, he refused to confess for a long time. He has been arrested according to law after being reported by the masses.

    北京市公安机关逮捕四名反革命分子
    新华社21日讯　北京市公安机关在人民群众的积极协助下，最近依法逮捕了四个反革命分子。他们是蒋介石集团的派遣特务贾文波，潜伏特务郑士义，有四条血债的伪大乡长刘万忠和包庇贾文波的劳动改造释放犯李应麟。
    贾文波去年6月潜来北京以后，就处在人民群众的监视和包围之中。在旅店里，在街上，在去太原的火车上，都有人发现他的可疑之处，先后有七、八个人访问公安机关或写信来检举他。经过侦查，证实贾文波解放前当过阎锡山的中校参谋、伪天津警备司令部的参谋处长。京津解放后逃到广州，在那里接受阎锡山的派遣任务，1950年潜回北京，秘密组织“国防部平津军政特派员公署”，发展了特务。不久他又逃往香港，在香港会见了国民党“情报局”的一个特务头子，并且向这个特务头子献策要回大陆组织“反共抗俄救国工作团”，还请求这个特务头子发给他活动经费。同时，他还分别同美国驻香港领事馆和其他蒋介石集团特务机关拉上关系。去年6月他接受特务机关的派遣任务来北京以后，到处拉拢旧关系，并企图搜集我重要工厂、仓库的情报，但受他拉拢的人察觉他的阴谋后，也向公安机关检举了他。贾文波还用暗语向香港特务机关发过情报。这个特务分子在进行了一连串的反革命活动以后，打算回香港请功受赏，然后再回大陆来进行更大的阴谋活动。可是，在他准备上火车逃出大陆以前，北京市公安机关把他逮捕了。在逮捕贾文波的同时，也逮捕了包庇贾文波的李应麟。李在1950年曾经参加过贾文波所组织的“国防部平津军政特派员公署”，被政府劳动改造，释放后仍不悔改，竟然包庇贾文波。
    反革命分子刘万忠是在新华印刷厂工人何少斌的协助下被公安机关捕获的。何少斌在了解到刘万忠当过三河县的伪大乡长，现在北京做工不敢回家的情况后，估计刘一定有严重罪恶，就设法打听他的住址，并且把他了解的情况和刘万忠的踪迹报告了公安机关。经公安机关调查，证实刘万忠在1946年曾害死过四个革命干部，解放后顶替一个死人的名子，在东北、内蒙等地流窜，就依法将他逮捕。
    潜伏特务郑士义1948年接受国民党“中统”特务机关布置的潜伏任务，解放后长期拒不坦白，经群众检举，已依法逮捕。
