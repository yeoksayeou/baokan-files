Xinhua News Agency, April 8th, TASS reported on the 7th that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, stated in his letter to British Prime Minister Macmillan that he hopes the British government will respond to the Soviet Union's initiative to no longer continue nuclear tests.

This letter was delivered to the British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Noble, by the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Malik, on April 5th.

Khrushchev pointed out in the letter that all sectors of British society are uneasy about the continued testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and they realize the disasters that atomic warfare may bring to Britain due to Britain's geographical environment.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet government has decided to unilaterally cease any type of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing from March 31, 1958. The Soviet government suggests that the British government, as well as the United States government, also take the same steps.

The letter also pointed out that if the governments of countries possessing nuclear weapons are unwilling to respond to the Soviet government's decision and continue atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, then the Soviet Union, in order to ensure its own security, can only consider itself no longer bound by the obligation it has undertaken to cease nuclear testing. The Soviet government does not want such a situation to occur.

    赫鲁晓夫致函麦克米伦
    希望英国政府放弃核试验
    新华社8日讯　塔斯社7日报道，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在他写给英国首相麦克米伦的信里表示，希望英国政府响应苏联关于不再继续进行核试验的倡议。
    这封信已经在4月5日由苏联驻英国大使马立克交给了英国协办外交事务国务大臣诺布耳。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中指出，英国社会各界对继续试验原子武器和氢武器感到不安，他们意识到由于英国的地理环境的关系原子战争可能给英国带来的灾难。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联政府已经决定从1958年3月31日起单方面停止任何类型的原子武器和氢武器试验。苏联政府建议英国政府以及美国政府也采取同样步骤。
    这封信还指出，如果拥有核武器的国家的政府不愿意响应苏联政府的决定，而继续原子武器和氢武器试验，那么，苏联为了保障本国的安全，只能认为自己不再受所承担的停止核试验的义务的约束。苏联政府不希望出现这样的局面。
