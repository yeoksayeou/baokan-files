    Yongchun County Initially Solves the Contradiction Between Industry and Agriculture
    Machines Roar Everywhere, Factories Throughout Urban and Rural Areas
    Most Villages Establish Power Grids and Hydroelectric Processing Plants
    (Our Dispatch) As agricultural production leaps forward, the need for industrial support becomes increasingly urgent. Yongchun County, Fujian Province, actively adapts to this situation, relying on the masses to vigorously develop small-scale local industries oriented towards agriculture, playing a huge role in promoting agricultural production and local economic prosperity.
    After agricultural cooperativization, Yongchun County launched a high tide of agricultural production, and the workload increased greatly, and the labor force immediately felt insufficient. In addition, local women did not have the habit of working in the fields, and were also constrained by the labor of grain processing, the contradiction of insufficient labor force became more and more acute. In many areas, there was a phenomenon that rice seedlings were urgently waiting to be transplanted, while wheat and barley had not yet been harvested.
    At that time, how to reform production tools, gradually use machinery to reduce or replace heavy physical labor, especially to liberate the huge amount of female labor from processing labor, became an urgent requirement put forward by agriculture to industry.
    In order to solve this contradiction between industry and agriculture in the great leap forward of agricultural production, Yongchun County adopted the policy of facing the countryside and serving agricultural production, relying on the masses, self-reliance, and actively developing small-scale local industries. The specific methods of this county are: taking hydropower construction as the key, establishing a network of small-scale rural processing industries, and at the same time establishing small-scale mining industries, granular fertilizer plants, and farm tool factories. In the past two years, the county has established 49 hydroelectric joint processing plants, hydraulic joint processing plants, and hydraulic processing plants. More than half of the villages have established mechanized processing and power supply networks for agricultural and sideline products. At the same time, 15 small factories and mines such as coal mines, farm tool factories, iron smelting plants, sulfur mines, and granular fertilizer plants have also been established. The total output value of these factories and mines in 1957, plus the total output value of handicrafts, accounted for 37.9% of the county's total industrial and agricultural output value.
    The development of local industry has greatly promoted agricultural production. The 49 joint processing plants processed more than 30 kinds of agricultural and sideline products, and more than 60% of the county's grain (including sweet potatoes and cassava) processing has been mechanized. This alone saves 600,000 labor days. If calculated at 25 labor days per mu of land, it is equivalent to planting 24,000 mu of land. With the joint processing plant, there is no shortage of labor, and it is convenient to grind flour and noodles. The planting area of ​​wheat and barley in the county has expanded accordingly, and the planting area has increased by more than three times in two years. Last year, the joint processing plant also used rice husks, straw, sweet potato vines, wheat bran, and peanut shells to process 10 million catties of refined feed, plus green feed, which can raise 50,000 pigs. The five granular fertilizer plants distributed in various districts of the county have supplied more than 570,000 catties of granular fertilizer to the countryside in the past two years. Last year, 15,000 tons of minerals were mined, increasing farmers' income by nearly 300,000 yuan.
    Through practice, Yongchun County has found the correct direction for county-run local small-scale industries. That is: relying on the masses, mainly small-scale, using local materials, local processing, local service, multiple production, and joint operation. However, the county did not go smoothly in the process of developing local industries, and there were two different tendencies and practices. For example, for rural hydropower construction, one tendency and practice is to make it big, mainly relying on state funds. For example, the total investment of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative's hydroelectric joint processing plant reached more than 52,000 yuan. The agricultural cooperative could not afford it and borrowed more than 30,000 yuan from the state. Although this processing plant is large in scale and plays a major role, the agricultural cooperative bears more than 1,800 yuan in interest each year, which is a heavy burden. The other is to make it small, and the masses pay for it completely. For example, Qianxi Village, Taoyuan Township, only built a shed and spent more than 100 yuan to establish a small processing station with two horsepower, which solved the processing of agricultural products for dozens of households in the village, and recovered all the investment in the first year. This fact proves that Qianxi Village's method of relying on the masses, building stations diligently and thriftily, and starting from a shed is the correct way to develop local small-scale industries, which can make small-scale industries bloom everywhere in the countryside.
    On the issue of the direction of local industrial development and service direction, Yongchun County has also had two different practices. One is to only engage in lighting power generation, such as the Shenchao and Guilong hydropower stations, which originally only had lighting equipment, but the processing equipment urgently needed by farmers was not available. As a result, not many farmers installed electric lights, and the masses had a lot of opinions. Later, with the processing equipment, production became greatly prosperous. Processing income accounts for three-quarters of the total income, while power generation and lighting income only account for one-quarter. The other practice is to first engage in production and processing, and then engage in lighting power generation. For example, the Meishan Agricultural Cooperative Hydropower Station first used hydropower to solve processing problems. This hydropower station is equipped with an 18-horsepower water turbine to drive a rice milling machine, a flour milling machine, and a sweet potato milling machine, each, for various processing, and it is constantly active throughout the year. The masses praised this joint processing plant as a "universal factory" and a "universal machine." Now this hydropower station is accumulating funds and preparing to install generators for power generation and lighting. Yongchun County adopted the policy of the Meishan Agricultural Cooperative Hydropower Station of first producing, processing, and then lighting and power generation. The county's hydropower stations and small industries have developed rapidly and vigorously. In two years, 21 small hydroelectric joint processing plants have been built, of which 19 were invested and constructed by the masses.

    永春县初步解决了工农业之间的矛盾
    机器到处响　工厂遍城乡
    多数乡村建立了供电网和水电加工厂
    本报讯　农业生产在向前大跃进的过程中，愈来愈迫切地需要工业的支援。福建省永春县积极主动地适应这种形势，依靠群众大办面向农业的小型地方工业，对促进农业生产和繁荣地方经济发挥了巨大作用。
    农业合作化以后，永春县掀起了农业生产高潮，工作量大大增加，劳动力立即感到不足。加以当地妇女没有下田劳动的习惯，而且又被粮食加工的劳动所牵制住，劳动力不足的矛盾就越来越尖锐。不少地区出现了秧苗急等下田而大小麦还没有收割的现象。
    当时，如何改革生产工具，逐步用机械来减轻或代替繁重的体力劳动，特别是把巨量的妇女劳动力从加工劳动中解脱出来，就成为农业向工业提出的迫切要求。
    为了解决农业生产大跃进中这个工农业之间的矛盾，永春县采取了面向农村、为农业生产服务的方针，依靠群众，自力更生，积极发展小型地方工业。这个县的具体做法是：以水电建设为纲，建立农村小型加工业之网，同时建立小型采矿业、颗粒肥料厂和农具厂等。两年多来，全县建立了水电联合加工厂、水力联合加工厂、水力加工厂共四十九座，一半以上的乡村建立了农副产品机械加工和供电网，同时还建立了煤矿、农具厂、炼铁厂、硫磺矿和颗粒肥料厂等小厂矿十五座。这些厂矿1957年的总产值加上手工业总产值，已占全县工农业总产值的37.9％。
    地方工业的发展，大大地促进了农业生产。四十九座联合加工厂加工的农副产品达三十多种，全县60％以上的粮食（包括番薯、木薯）加工已实现了机械化。仅此一项，就省下六十万个劳动日。如以每亩田需二十五个劳动日计算，就等于多种了两万四千亩田。有了联合加工厂以后，劳动力不感到缺乏，磨粉磨面也方便，全县大小麦种植面积随之扩大，两年中种植面积增加三倍多。去年联合加工厂还利用谷壳、稻草、番薯藤、麦皮、花生壳加工成精饲料一千万斤，加上青饲料，可以养猪五万头。分布在全县各区的五个颗粒肥料厂，两年已供应给农村五十七万多斤颗粒肥料。去年开采了一万五千吨矿物，使农民增加了近三十万元的收入。
    永春县通过实践，找到了县办地方小型工业的正确方向。这就是：依靠群众、小型为主、就地取材、就地加工、就地服务、多种生产、联合经营。但是，这个县在发展地方工业的过程中，并不是一帆风顺的，曾经出现过两种不同的倾向和做法。例如对农村水电建设，一种倾向和做法是搞大的，主要靠国家资金。如曙光农业社水电联合加工厂，全部投资共达五万二千多元，农业社出不起，向国家贷款三万多元。这种加工厂虽然规模大作用大，但是农业社每年负担利息达一千八百多元，包袱较重。另一种是搞小的，完全由群众出钱办。如桃源乡前溪村只搭了一个草棚，花了一百多元钱，建立了一个两马力的小加工站，解决了一村几十户农产品加工，头一年就收回了全部投资。这个事实证明，前溪村的依靠群众、勤俭建站、草棚起家的办法是发展地方小型工业的正确道路，可使小型工业在农村遍地开花。
    在地方工业发展方向、服务方向这个问题上，永春县也有过两种不同的做法。一种是只搞照明发电，如神潮、龟龙两个水电站，原先只搞照明设备，农民迫切需要的加工设备反而没有。结果，农家装电灯的不多，群众意见很大。后来有了加工设备，生产才大大兴旺起来。加工收入占全部收入的四分之三，而发电照明收入只占四分之一。另一种做法是先搞生产加工，后搞照明发电。如美山农业社水电站先利用水力解决加工问题。这个水电站装一个十八马力的水轮机，带动碾米机、磨粉机、磨薯机各一台，进行多种加工，一年四季活不断。群众称赞这种联合加工厂是“万能工厂”、“万能机器”。现在这个水电站正在积累资金，准备装发电机来发电照明。永春县采取了美山农业社水电站的先生产、加工、后照明发电的方针，全县的水电站、小工业迅速蓬勃发展，两年内就建成了二十一个小型水电联合加工厂，其中十九个就是群众投资建设的。
