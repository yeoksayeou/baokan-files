This newspaper, Changsha, April 24th: The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is implementing dense planting for all rice paddies this year. This is a major reform in the autonomous prefecture's cultivation technology. Currently, farmers of all ethnic groups have prepared more than 137,000 dense planting tools. At the same time, through the form of on-the-spot mobilization rallies for dense planting, they have exchanged dense planting experience and trained a large number of dense planting experts.

In the past, the autonomous prefecture had weak agricultural technical forces, and rice paddies were generally planted with wide rows and sparse planting. This year, after trial planting comparisons, farmers of all ethnic groups decided to change the sparse planting method and implement dense planting of rice throughout the prefecture.

In order to ensure the realization of this target, nearly 30 million jin of seed grain have been sown, an average of 15 jin per mu, a doubling compared to last year. Paddy fields have also been deepened from four or five inches last year to six or seven inches, and a large number of iron double-wheeled double-shared plows and various improved plows have been promoted throughout the prefecture. The average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of paddy field has increased from 50 dan last year to 800 dan this year. At the same time, since last winter and this spring, a large army has been specially organized to establish a mountain terraced field irrigation system. This autonomous region, where more than two-thirds of the paddy fields had no water irrigation before liberation, now has more than two-thirds of the paddy fields that can withstand drought for 30 to 60 days.

    湘西土家族苗族农民改宽行稀植为普遍密植
  　本报长沙24日电　湘西土家族苗族自治州今年水稻全部推行密植。这是自治州耕作技术的大改革。现在，各族农民已准备了密植器十三万七千多架。同时，通过密植誓师现场大会的形式，交流密植经验，训练了大批密植能手。
    自治州过去农业技术力量薄弱，一般稻田都是宽行稀植。今年各族农民经过试插比较，决定改变稀植方法，实现全州水稻密植。
    为了保证实现这个指标，播下的种谷近三千万斤，平均每亩十五斤，比去年增加一倍。稻田也从去年的四、五寸深耕到六、七寸，全州推广了大批铁质双轮双铧犁和各种改良犁。每亩稻田的平均施肥量，从去年的五十担增加到今年的八百担。同时，从去冬今春以来，还专门组织水利大军建立山区梯田灌溉系统。这个在解放前有三分之二以上稻田无水灌溉的自治区，现在已经有三分之二以上的稻田能抗旱三十天到六十天了。
