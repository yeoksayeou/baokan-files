Excellent Varieties

    “Big Horse Tooth” is an excellent variety of sunflower for consumption. This variety has high yield, full seeds, and strong resistance to saline-alkali soil. It is widely planted in the Yanbei area of Shanxi. “Big Horse Tooth” has thick and strong stalks, generally seven to eight feet tall, and a growing period of about 130 days. The kernels have a low oil content.
    “Three Eyebrows,” grown in some areas of Hebei Province, and “Wu Zui,” grown in Heilongjiang and other places, are also excellent sunflower varieties bred by Chinese farmers. "Three Eyebrows" is for consumption, and "Wu Zui" is an intermediate variety between edible and oil-producing.
    “Prairie Man,” “Soviet No. 3,” and “Hungarian No. 1” are three of a batch of excellent sunflower varieties that our agricultural departments introduced from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union. These three varieties are all oil-producing, with shorter plants and small seeds but high oil content. "Prairie Man" has a growing period of about 100 days. "Soviet No. 3" has a slightly longer growing period than "Prairie Man."

    “大马牙”和“草原人”
    “大马牙”是食用种向日葵的一个良种。这个品种产量高、籽粒饱、抗盐碱性也较强，山西雁北地区种植较多。“大马牙”茎秆粗壮，一般高七、八尺，生育期约一百三十天左右，籽仁含油分较低。
    河北等省一些地区种植的“三道眉”和黑龙江等地的“乌咀”，也都是我国农民选育出来的向日葵良种。“三道眉”是食用种，“乌咀”是介于食用油用之间的中间种。
    “草原人”“苏联三号”“匈牙利一号”等是我国农业部门由苏联等兄弟国家引进来的一批向日葵良种当中的三个。这三个良种都是油用种，植株较短，种籽小但含油多。“草原人”生长期一百天左右。“苏联三号”生长期较“草原人”略长。
