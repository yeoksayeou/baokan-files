This is the Best Policy
Currently, several provinces and regions are experiencing varying degrees of drought. At this time, the south is transplanting rice seedlings, and the north is sowing cotton and other crops. This is an extremely important moment. Today, we are reporting on the drought resistance activities in several provinces, from which everyone can see that the broad masses have high confidence in fighting the drought, many methods, and significant results. This is very natural. This year, the countryside has generally undergone rectification, and the great leap forward in production plans inspires everyone. In addition, the amazing achievements in large-scale water conservancy projects are before our eyes, and the masses have great enthusiasm. And this is a powerful guarantee to overcome the current difficulties. In areas where drought is occurring, we hope that the comrades there will give full play to their fighting spirit, better rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and summarize the valuable experience of drought resistance in the past. Those who have water should consider how to use it rationally, and those who lack water should seek water sources in many ways. In short, we must do everything possible to rush to plant and rush to transplant, and do not have the lucky mentality of waiting for rain. It is better if it rains, but we must plant even if it doesn't rain - this is the best policy.

    这是上上策
    目前，好些省区内都发生了不同程度的干旱；而这个时候，南方正在插秧，北方正在下种棉花和其他农作物。这是一个极其重要的时刻。今天我们报道了几个省的抗旱活动，大家由此可以看到广大群众抗旱的信心很高，办法很多，效果显著。这是很自然的。农村今年普遍经过了整风，大跃进的生产计划鼓舞着每个人，再加上大兴水利的惊人成绩摆在眼前，群众的干劲是很大的。而这正是战胜当前困难的有力保证。凡是出现旱象的地区，我们希望那里的同志充分发挥战斗精神，更好地依靠群众、发动群众，总结过去抗旱的宝贵经验。还有水的要考虑怎样合理用水，缺了水的要多方寻觅水源，总之，要千方百计抢种抢插，不要存等雨的侥幸心理。下雨更好，不下雨也要种上——这才是上上策。
