Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: The Third National Congress of the All-China Youth Federation began its general session today.

Wang Chengliang, a representative of the youth of the No. 2 Steel Plant in Anshan, said that their youth solidarity furnace, after repeated revisions of this year's production increase and cost reduction targets, decided to increase national steel production by 40,000 tons and reduce costs by 820,000 yuan for the whole year. Through the efforts of all young workers, the target of increasing steel production by 10,000 tons in the first quarter has been successfully achieved. Wu Keguang, a milling worker from Chongqing Machine Tool Plant who completed the first five-year plan one year and eight months ahead of schedule, and Teng Huimin, a worker from Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant who completed five years of production tasks in three and a half years, both stated in their speeches that they would build on their existing achievements, redouble their efforts, and continue to move forward.

Li Guangdan, leader of the agricultural branch of the Wenzhou Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team, who volunteered to build Da Chen Island in 1956, said that after two years of hard work, they, together with the troops stationed there and the residents, had completely changed the face of Da Chen Island.

Tian Zhen and Fu Rongshan, youth representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, both used vivid examples in their speeches to illustrate the role of youth in the army in the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. Tian Zhen said that all the young people in the People's Liberation Army are redoubling their efforts and are determined to be promoters in the modernization of the People's Liberation Army. At present, young people in more than 150 units of the entire army have launched a revolutionary competition centered on training. The famous athlete Zheng Fengrong issued the bold statement of "Advancing towards new world records!" She stated that she would never be satisfied with her existing achievements, and would definitely improve her political awareness, continue to improve her sports technical level, strive to improve the high jump record further, and contribute more to the people's sports cause. Ding Shujing, attending physician of ophthalmology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College, said that all the staff of their hospital have decided to take a Great Leap Forward towards "everything for the patient" in terms of improving service attitude, improving service quality, and saving for the country and for patients.

The report by Sha Yanbao, a youth representative of the Kawa ethnic group in Yunnan, on their struggle against superstitious ideas for the purpose of increasing agricultural production, was warmly welcomed by all the representatives. He said that Meng'e Township in Shuangjiang County, Yunnan Province, is a township inhabited by the Kawa ethnic group. In order to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture, the Communist Youth League members of this township broke the superstitious ideas that the Kawa ethnic group had held for thousands of years, such as being unwilling to accumulate fertilizer, not daring to dig ditches, and sacrificing cattle, pigs, and chickens during sacrifices, and stopping production for two days each time. This year, in two months, the whole township accumulated one million catties of fertilizer, newly opened 255 mu of paddy fields, and dug five new water ditches.

A total of twenty-five representatives spoke at today's meeting.

At today's meeting, Guan Shixiong, director of the Credentials Committee of the Congress, made a report to the Congress on the results of the review of the qualifications of the representatives, and the Congress approved the report. Qu Tangliang, vice chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, made an explanation to the Congress on the draft of the Constitution of the All-China Youth Federation.
