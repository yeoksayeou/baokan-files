    Delivering Theatre Tickets to Your Doorstep

    One day at noon, after finishing my meal, I returned to the office building. As soon as I entered, I encountered an unfamiliar female comrade. I learned that she was from the Experimental Theatre, delivering theatre tickets to our door. While posting flyers, she explained in detail the plots of dramas such as "Ah, the Little Moon of America," "Higher Garbage," and "Huang Tan Visits His Son in Prison." It was so fortunate! Some time ago, I regretted missing "Ah, the Little Moon of America" because of other business. Now that the opportunity was brought to me, it was really great. I bought a ticket. I went to the second and third floors and shouted, and many other people came to buy tickets. We all thanked her for this spirit of automatically providing door-to-door ticket sales service.

    送上门来卖戏票
    一天中午，我吃完饭回办公楼。一进门，碰到一位陌生的女同志，一问原来她是实验剧场的工作同志送上门来卖戏票的。她一面张贴海报，一面详细地介绍着“哎呀呀，美国的小月亮”、“高等垃圾”、“黄谭探监”等戏剧剧情。多巧，前些时，我因为有事没有看到“哎呀呀，美国的小月亮”，还一直在惋惜呢，这回给送上门来，真太好了。我买了一张。跑到二楼、三楼一吆喝，又有许多人跑来买了戏票。我们都感谢她这种自动上门来售票的服务精神。　（北京市北新桥解正中）
