    Communist Ideology Surges; Key Production Problems Solved
    Shanghai's Xuhui District Convenes Production Collaboration Meeting in the Form of a Temple Fair

    (Reported by this newspaper) The "Liberation Daily" reports: On the morning of the 26th, the Xuhui District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai held a district-wide industrial production collaboration conference in the form of a temple fair. Over 700 leading cadres and production business cadres from 241 central and independent factories in the district participated in the conference. Through the conference's networking activities, more than 150 factories and over 220 factory-times established collaborative relationships, exchanging resources and supporting each other. The spirit of "One for all, all for one" permeated the entire venue.

    The format of the collaboration meeting was novel and lively. The venue was plastered with large-character posters from various factories, some with pictures, some with tables, and some factories even displayed samples of surplus materials, clearly indicating how much potential and materials that factory could support brother factories with, and also indicating what support that factory required. After looking at the large-character posters and samples, the supply and demand sides would negotiate face-to-face and make deals on the spot. Some factories looked through all the large-character posters but couldn't solve their problems, so they used a microphone to call out, and brother factories would take the initiative to contact them. For example, the Dazhongyuan Resistor Factory requested support for steel sheet annealing, and the Fuhua Wire Drawing Factory immediately agreed to help.

    Through the meeting, many factories solved key production problems in the Great Leap Forward. For example, workers at the Yuanfeng Stocking Needle Factory put forward many rationalization proposals to change manual operations to automation, but the factory itself could not do drafting, mold-making, or sand casting, nor could it do machine repair. It had sent five or six people to more than 20 factories in the city for support, but to no avail, leaving the entire factory extremely anxious. However, at this collaboration meeting, the problem was completely solved in just one hour. They found the Guanghua Mast Lamp Factory to do the drawing design, the Zhongcaiji Wooden Shell Factory to make the wooden mold, the Xuhui Foundry to do the sand casting, and the Dingxin Printing and Dyeing Factory to do the machine repair. The public representative happily returned to report the good news to the workers.

    Some factories both supported others and solved their own difficulties. The Xinhua Automobile Repair Factory only had 50% of its tasks assigned, causing difficulties, while the Safety Fire Equipment Factory had very tight tasks and was looking for help. At the meeting, the two sides immediately linked up, and the Xinhua Factory became a long-term processing factory for the Safety Fire Equipment Factory. Some factories also sent technical personnel to assist brother factories. The Shanghai Cement Factory sent one fifth-grade and one third-grade technician each to support the Hongwen Paper Mill for a month, and also sent one fifth-grade welder to support the China United Dyestuff Factory No. 2 for a month. Many factories exchanged surplus materials and communicated their needs at the meeting. The Xin Dalu Screw Factory had more than 40 lathe tool heads, more than 6 kilograms of wind steel knives, and two milling heads. These materials had been backlogged for several years, and after the "double-anti" campaign, a report to the professional company also failed to resolve the issue. At this conference, they finally found customers, allowing these backlogged materials to play a role again.

    This meeting was not only a production collaboration conference, but also a political conference. It not only collaborated on production, but more importantly promoted communist ideology. Many factories tried their best to help brother factories solve difficulties, and moving examples continued to emerge. For example, seven factories wanted a six-foot lathe at the Sida Medical Factory, and the first to register was the Xinfeng Rubber Factory. However, when the Xinfeng Rubber Factory learned that the Tianxing Candy Factory needed it more, it resolutely gave it to the latter. Although some factories already had very tight tasks for the year and could not accept large batches of tasks, they still tried every means to tap potential and spend a small amount of time helping brother factories solve urgent key problems. The Xuhui Foundry organized a support team to help brother factories with sand casting in their spare time, and all the administrative cadres and full-time cadres in the factory who knew how to do sand casting also participated. The Fuxing Machine Factory also had very tight tasks for the year, but the factory had a thousand workers (grades 3 to 7) who volunteered to use their spare time to support brother factories with lathe, fitter, planer, and milling tasks.

    After the conference and decentralized networking activities, the cadres who attended felt that they had gained a lot. Many cadres reflected: "Not only were production problems solved, but also seeing everyone's collectivism and spirit of mutual support greatly enlightened our thinking." Twenty or thirty factories immediately wrote large-character posters announcing their potential and resolving to support others.

    共产主义思想高涨　生产关键问题解决
    上海徐汇区用庙会形式召开生产协作会议
    本报讯　解放日报消息：26日上午，中共上海市徐汇区委用庙会形式召开了一个全区性工业生产协作大会。参加这次大会的有全区二百四十一个中心厂和独立厂的领导干部以及生产业务干部等七百余人。经过大会的联系活动，有一百五十多个厂、二百二十多个厂次互相发生了协作关系，互通有无，互相支持。“我为人人，人人为我”的思想洋溢全场。
    协作会议的开法是新颖活泼的。场里场外贴满了各厂的大字报，有图片，有表格，还有的厂陈列了剩余物资的样品，很明显地表明那个厂有多少潜力和物资可以支援兄弟厂，也表明那个厂要求支援些什么。看了大字报和样品，供求双方就当面协议，当场成交。有的厂看遍大字报，没有解决问题，就用麦克风叫，兄弟厂听到了就主动去联系。如大中原电阻厂要求支援钢皮退火，复华拉丝厂马上答允帮助。
    通过会议，许多厂解决了大跃进中的生产关键问题。例如：沅丰袜针厂工人提出许多合理化建议，把手工操作改成自动化，可是厂里自己不会制图、制模、翻砂，也不会机修，曾派出五、六人跑遍了全市二十几个厂要求支援，都没有办法，全厂焦急万分。但是在这天的协作会上，只一小时就完全解决了问题。他们找到光华桅灯厂搞图纸设计，找到钟才记木壳厂搞木模，找到徐汇铸铁厂搞翻砂，找到鼎新印染厂搞机修。公方代表欢天喜地回去向工人报喜。
    有的厂既支援别人，又解决了自己的困难。新华汽车修配厂任务只有50％，发生困难，而安全消防器材厂任务很紧，正在找人帮助。在会上两下子当场挂钩，新华厂成了安全消防器材厂的长期加工厂。有的厂还派出技术力量援助兄弟厂。上海水泥厂派出五级、三级技工各一名支援宏文造纸厂一个月，又派出五级电焊工一名支援中联染料二厂一个月。有许多厂在会上交流剩余物资，互通有无。新大陆螺丝厂原有车刀头四十多只、风钢刀六公斤多、铣头两只，这些物资积压了好几年，双反后报告到专业公司也无法处理。在这次大会上终于找到了主顾，使这些积压物资重新发挥了作用。
    这个会议不仅是生产协作大会，而且也是政治大会。不仅在生产上协作，更重要的是发扬了共产主义思想。许多厂想尽办法帮助兄弟厂解决困难，动人的事例不断涌现。例如四达医疗厂的一部六尺车床有七个厂要，第一个登记的是新丰橡胶厂。但是当新丰橡胶厂知道天星糖果厂比他们更需要的时候，就毅然让给后者。有些厂虽然全年的任务已很紧，无法接受大批任务，但他们还是千方百计挖潜力，花少量时间帮助兄弟厂来解决急迫的关键问题。徐汇翻砂厂组织了一个支援小组利用业余时间帮助兄弟厂翻砂，厂里行政干部和脱产干部中会搞翻砂的也全部参加。福星机器厂全年任务也很紧，但这个厂有一千个工人（三级到七级）志愿报名利用业余时间支援兄弟厂的车、钳、刨、铣任务。
    经过大会及分散联系活动，到会干部都感到收获很大。不少干部反映：“不但生产上解决了问题，同时看到大家的集体主义、互相支援的精神，思想上也有很大启发。”有二三十个工厂马上写大字报公布潜力，决心支援别人。
