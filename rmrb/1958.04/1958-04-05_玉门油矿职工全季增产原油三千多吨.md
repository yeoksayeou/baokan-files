Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, April 4th – During the in-depth development of the Double-Anti Campaign, workers at the Yumen Oilfield overfulfilled their first-quarter drilling, oil extraction, and refining plans. Crude oil production increased by more than 3,000 tons for the quarter. The total increase in production of six major petroleum products, including gasoline, kerosene, light diesel, and lubricating oil, was more than 1,930 tons. Drilling workers persisted in using rapid drilling methods with heavy pressure and large pump volumes, which they had been hesitant to use in the past. In March, they completed the entire month's drilling plan nine days ahead of schedule, and drilling accidents decreased by 79% compared to February. (Photo attached)

Karamay's oil extraction workers are full of revolutionary zeal, ensuring the completion of the state plan with an overfulfillment of 28.5% for the whole year. (Contribution from Xinjiang Petroleum Workers' News)
