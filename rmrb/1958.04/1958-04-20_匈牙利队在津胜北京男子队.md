    匈牙利队在津胜北京男子队
    新华社天津19日电  匈牙利国家乒乓球队18日在天津和北京男子乒乓球队举行团体赛，匈牙利队以五比三获胜。
    北京队获胜的三场，全部是去年和王传耀一起获得全国男子双打第一名的胡炳权赢得的。他先以二比一战胜福尔迪和布尔尼，接着又以二比一挫败了今年欧洲冠军别尔切克。胡炳权18日始终以猛烈的抽球赢得主动，他在场上表现得很沉着，不时变换抽球的方向，并且运用远抽近吊战术得到成功。别尔切克18日以二比零打败了北京队的　淮光和庄家富。
    匈牙利国家乒乓球队18日在同北京男子乒乓球队进行团体赛以前，还同沈阳女子乒乓球队、北京男子乒乓球队举行了五场男、女单打和女子双打比赛，结果匈牙利队获得全胜。
