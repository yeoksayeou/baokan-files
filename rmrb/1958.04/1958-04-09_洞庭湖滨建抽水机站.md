    Pumping Station Built on the Shores of Dongting Lake
    In order to ensure that 640,000 mu of farmland on the shores of West Dongting Lake are free from waterlogging and to guarantee a bumper harvest, Hunan Province is building an electric pumping station. The entire project includes the Changde Deshan Power Plant, the Deshan Step-up Station, the Zhiwan and Longdaji Step-down Stations, and a 32-kilometer transmission line from Deshan to Longdaji. These projects will be completed and energized on May 1st. After the completion of the entire project, it is estimated that the beneficiary farmland will increase grain production by 200 million jin in 1958. After the pumping season, the power supply can be supplied to Changde City.

    洞庭湖滨建抽水机站
    为了确保西洞庭湖滨六十四万亩农田免于渍淹，保证农业丰产，湖南省正在兴建电动抽水机站。全部工程包括常德德山发电厂、德山升压站、芷湾和龙打吉降压站、德山到龙打吉的三十二公里输电线等。这些工程将于5月1日建成送电。工程全部竣工后，预计可使受益农田在1958年增产粮食二亿斤。在抽水季节过后，电源可以供应常德市。
