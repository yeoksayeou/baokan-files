The anti-American sentiment has been rising universally, and the movement to strive for national independence has seen new development in Latin American countries, which are most strictly controlled by the United States and regarded as the "backyard" of the United States, in the past year or so.

American imperialism has never placed the sovereignty of Latin American countries in its eyes. Instead, it firmly controls these countries politically and economically through its loyal servants. Therefore, the Latin American people's struggle against the United States is often linked to the struggle against dictatorial regimes.

Due to the powerful development of the people's struggle for democracy and national independence, the dictatorial regimes in many Latin American countries have collapsed under the pressure of the people. In January and February 1957, the people of Haiti defeated President Magloire's conspiracy to stage a coup after his term expired, and overthrew the provisional president, Pierre Louis, who openly revived the old dictator. In May, the people of Colombia overthrew Pinilla's dictatorship. In July, the Guatemalan dictator Armas, who was brought to power by the United States, was assassinated. In January this year, the Venezuelan dictatorial tyrant Jiménez was overthrown again. Recently, in some Latin American countries, the anti-dictatorial struggle has developed into armed struggle. In April, the Cuban rebel forces launched a "total war" against the Batista dictatorship, launching fierce battles in the Cuban capital and half of the country's provinces. The Batista dictatorship is only surviving with the direct intervention of the United States. In addition, the "Citizens' Army for Paraguayan Freedom" has also launched an armed struggle in southern Paraguay. In many areas of Colombia, 70% of agricultural workers have joined the guerrillas, taking up arms to defend their rights and interests.

The development of the Latin American people's struggle for democracy and national independence is also reflected in the victories achieved by the people of some countries in the general election. On February 23, 1958, as a result of the Argentine presidential election, Frondizi, who was supported by patriotic and democratic forces, including the Communist Party, was elected. This event is not only a major victory for the Argentine people against the Aramburu military rule, but also an encouragement to the entire Latin American democratic movement and anti-American movement. At present, the people of Chile, Uruguay and other countries are also actively striving to defeat the reactionary forces attached to the United States in the upcoming general election, and elect a government that conforms to their democratic and national aspirations.

Another important aspect of the Latin American people's struggle for national independence is to oppose the economic control and plunder of American monopoly capital. American monopoly capital has always rudely undermined the independent and autonomous trade policies of Latin American countries and plundered the resources of Latin American countries. American monopoly capital manipulates Latin America's foreign trade and exploits Latin American countries through unequal trade practices such as raising import tariffs, lowering import prices, and restricting import quantities, and puts the economies of these countries into a difficult situation. For example, due to the drop in copper prices in the US market, Chile loses 80 million US dollars each year, and Brazil loses 200 million US dollars due to the drop in coffee prices. In addition, the United States dumps "surplus" agricultural products to Latin American countries, which are not only expensive, but also seize the traditional markets of other Latin American countries. For example, the United States signed an agreement with Brazil to export 1.8 million tons of "surplus" wheat to Brazil within three years. This incident aroused protests from Argentina and Uruguay, which have always exported wheat to Brazil. Since the United States is the main buyer of Latin American products, the US’s increase in tariffs and restrictions on import quantities have had an extremely adverse impact on the economies of Latin American countries. This cannot but arouse the universal rise of anti-American sentiment in Latin American countries. Recently, Chilean President Ibáñez canceled his planned visit to the United States because he was dissatisfied with this trade discrimination policy of the United States.

In order to get rid of American trade control, many Latin American countries are striving to restore and expand trade relations with socialist countries such as the Soviet Union. At present, fourteen Latin American countries have trade relations with socialist countries. Especially Argentina, which recently signed 59 trade contracts with six socialist countries including the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and Yugoslavia, with a total value of 27 million US dollars. In addition, Brazil and Uruguay also hope to trade with the Soviet Union. In January 1958, Colombia received a Soviet trade delegation, and in January and February, an Argentine trade delegation visited the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries.

The Latin American people have also carried out resolute struggles in protecting national resources and national sovereignty. The Brazilian people have launched a widespread protest movement against ceding Fernando de Noronha Island to the United States as a missile test center, and have achieved victories in the struggle against the United States forcing the amendment of the petroleum law and against the United States exploring uranium mines in Brazil and prohibiting the sale of fissionable materials to the United States. The Panamanian people continue to struggle to regain full sovereignty over the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone.

The Latin American people have also carried out a struggle against the United States’ conspiracy to drag Latin American countries into aggressive military blocs, and have successively defeated the United States’ plans to piece together the "South Atlantic Treaty Organization" and to link the Organization of American States with the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

The above facts fully demonstrate that under the international situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the Latin American people, encouraged by the high tide of national independence movements in Asian and African countries, are no longer willing to be in the state of the "backyard" of the United States. Although the struggle of the Latin American people is still long-term and arduous, sparks can start a prairie fire, and the national independence movement in Latin American countries will continue to achieve greater victories.

    拉丁美洲民族独立运动的发展
    章叶
    最近一年多以来，受美国控制最严、被美国视为“后院”的拉丁美洲各国，反美情绪普遍高涨，争取民族独立的运动有了新的发展。
    美帝国主义一向不把拉丁美洲国家的主权放在眼里，而通过它扶植的忠实奴仆从政治上和经济上牢牢地控制这些国家。因此，拉丁美洲人民的反美斗争和反独裁政权的斗争往往是联系在一起的。
    由于人民争取民主和民族独立斗争的强大发展，拉丁美洲许多国家的独裁政权在人民的压力下纷纷垮台。1957年1、2月间，海地人民击败了任期已满的马格鲁阿总统举行政变的阴谋，推翻了公然为旧独裁者复辟的临时总统皮尔·路易。5月，哥伦比亚人民推翻了皮尼利亚的独裁统治。7月，美国一手扶植上台的危地马拉独裁者阿马斯被刺身死。今年1月，委内瑞拉独裁暴君希门尼斯又被推翻。最近期间，在拉丁美洲的一些国家里，反独裁斗争已经发展为武装斗争。古巴起义部队在4月间发动了反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的“总体战”，在古巴首都以及全国的半数省份中展开了激烈的战斗。巴蒂斯塔独裁政权只是依靠美国的直接干涉苟延残喘。此外，“争取巴拉圭自由公民军”在巴拉圭南部也展开了武装斗争。哥伦比亚许多地区有70％的农业工人参加了游击队，拿起武器保卫自己的权利和利益。
    拉丁美洲国家人民争取民主和民族独立的斗争的发展，也表现在一些国家的人民在大选中所取得的胜利上。1958年2月23日，阿根廷总统选举的结果，得到包括共产党在内的爱国民主力量支持的弗朗迪西当选。这件事情不仅是阿根廷人民反对阿兰布鲁军事统治的重大胜利，而且也是对整个拉丁美洲民主运动和反美运动的鼓舞。目前，智利、乌拉圭等国人民也在积极争取在未来的大选中，挫败依附于美国的反动势力，并选出一个符合于他们的民主和民族愿望的政府。
    拉丁美洲人民争取民族独立斗争的另一个重要方面，是反对美国垄断资本的经济控制和掠夺。美国垄断资本一向粗暴地破坏拉丁美洲国家的独立自主贸易政策，并掠夺拉丁美洲国家的资源。美国垄断资本操纵了拉丁美洲的对外贸易，并用提高进口关税、降低进口货物价格和限制进口数量等不平等贸易手段剥削拉丁美洲国家，并使这些国家的经济陷入困境。例如，由于美国市场上的铜价下跌，智利每年损失八千万美元，由于咖啡价格下跌，巴西损失两亿美元。另外，美国则向拉丁美洲国家倾销“剩余”农产品，不但价格昂贵，而且夺取了拉丁美洲其他国家的传统市场，如美国同巴西签订了一项协定，在三年内向巴西输出一百八十万吨“剩余”小麦。这件事引起了一向向巴西输出小麦的阿根廷和乌拉圭的抗议。由于美国是拉丁美洲产品的主要买主，美国提高关税和限制进口数量，对拉丁美洲国家的经济造成了极其恶劣的影响。这就不能不激起拉丁美洲国家反美情绪的普遍高涨。最近，智利总统伊巴?斯就是因为不满美国这种贸易歧视政策而取消了原定的访美计划。
    为了摆脱美国的贸易控制，拉丁美洲许多国家正在争取恢复和扩大同苏联等社会主义国家的贸易关系。现在，已有十四个拉丁美洲国家同社会主义国家有贸易关系。特别是阿根廷，在最近期间同苏、捷、匈、罗、波、南等六个社会主义国家签订了五十九项贸易合同，总值两千七百万美元。此外，巴西、乌拉圭也都希望同苏联进行贸易。1958年1月间，哥伦比亚接待了苏联贸易代表团，1、2月间，阿根廷贸易代表团访问了苏联和东欧社会主义国家。
    拉丁美洲人民在保护国家资源和国家主权方面也进行了坚决的斗争。巴西人民为反对把斐南多诺隆耶岛让给美国作导弹试验中心而展开了广泛的抗议运动，并在为反对美国强迫修改石油法的斗争和反对美国勘察巴西铀矿、禁止把裂变物资卖给美国的斗争等方面取得了胜利。巴拿马人民继续为收回对巴拿马运河和运河区的全部主权而斗争。
    拉丁美洲人民还进行了反对美国把拉丁美洲国家拖入侵略性的军事集团的阴谋，先后击败了美国拼凑“南大西洋公约组织”和把美洲国家组织同“北大西洋公约组织”联在一起的计划。
    以上事实充分说明，在东风压倒西风的国际局势下，为亚非国家民族独立运动高涨所鼓舞的拉丁美洲人民已经不甘于处在美国“后院”的境地了。尽管拉丁美洲人民的斗争还是长期和艰巨的，但是，星火可以燎原，拉丁美洲国家的民族独立运动将会继续取得更大的胜利。
