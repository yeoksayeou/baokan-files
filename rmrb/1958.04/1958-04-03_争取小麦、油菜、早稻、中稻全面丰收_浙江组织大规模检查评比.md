Zhejiang Organizes Large-Scale Inspection and Appraisal

(Our Dispatch) As the spring plowing season has arrived in Zhejiang Province, the agricultural production inspection teams organized by the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party set off yesterday in different directions to conduct a major inspection in various localities.

Prior to this, mass production inspections had been conducted at the county, township, and commune levels throughout Zhejiang. This province-wide inspection is a combination of top-down inspection and bottom-up mass inspection, unprecedented in scale.

Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, serves as the head of the inspection team. The inspection work is expected to last for one month.

According to the requirements of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the basic task of this inspection is to promote a comprehensive bumper harvest of crops such as wheat, rapeseed, early rice, and mid-season rice throughout the province through inspection and appraisal. Therefore, the inspection team will focus on inspecting the current preparations for plowing, including: sowing and seedling management, fertilizer, water conservancy, soil improvement, cultivation technique training, tool reform, agricultural cooperative management, and production planning, a total of seven major items. It will also inspect rural rectification, commune consolidation, the leadership of the Party committee, and ideological and political work.

Lin Hujia, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke before the inspection team set off. He pointed out that this inspection is to mobilize the people of the province to exert their utmost efforts, adopt various advanced yield-increasing measures in every possible way, and realize a great leap forward in agricultural production throughout the province this year. After the inspection is completed, opinions will be put forward on the work of the inspected counties, and appraisals will be conducted within the scope of each special district. The winning counties in each special district will be commended and rewarded. For backward units, the inspection team will help them find the causes and solutions in order to achieve a common leap forward.
                                                                                                                                                  (Zhang Jisheng)

    争取小麦、油菜、早稻、中稻全面丰收
    浙江组织大规模检查评比
    本报讯　浙江省已到春耕季节，昨天中共浙江省委组织的农业生产大检查检查团分路出发前往各地，进行大检查。
    在这以前，浙江各地曾进行了以县、乡、社为单位的群众性生产大检查。这次全省大检查是自上而下的检查和自下而上的群众性检查的结合，规模之大，前所未有。
    中共浙江省委第一书记江华担任检查团团长。预计检查工作要进行一个月。
    根据中共浙江省委要求，这次检查的基本任务是通过检查评比，推动全省小麦、油菜、早稻、中稻等作物全面丰收。因此，检查团将着重检查当前的备耕工作，包括：播种和秧田管理、肥料、水利、土壤改良、栽培技术训练、工具改革、农业社经营管理和生产规划等七大项目。同时也检查农村整风、整社、党委的领导和思想政治工作等。
    中共浙江省委书记处书记林乎加在检查团出发前讲了话。他指出，这次检查是为了动员全省人民鼓足干劲，千方百计地采用各种先进增产措施，实现今年全省农业生产大跃进。这次检查完毕后，要对检查过的县的工作提出意见，在各个专区范围内进行评比。各专区的优胜县，将给予表扬和奖励。对于后进的单位，检查团要帮助他们找出原因和解决办法，以求得共同跃进。
