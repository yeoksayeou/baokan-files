From the *Liberation Daily*: Based on over 50,000 large-character posters discussing teaching topics, a great debate to fundamentally reform teaching and transform thought is unfolding enthusiastically at Fudan University.

On March 28th, the third-year students of the Chinese Department initiated the great debate. The central issue of the debate is whether to "favor the present and slight the past" or "favor the past and slight the present." By the 30th, it had developed into a large-scale debate involving all faculty and students of the department.

At the beginning of the debate, those who advocated "favoring the past and slighting the present" put forward four main arguments. They believed that: First, China has a long history and rich cultural heritage; Second, if we "slight the past," given the current shortage of talent in studying ancient culture, it will lead to a "lack of successors" for the cultural heritage; Third, judging from the current level of students in the Chinese Department, their mastery of ancient books is insufficient, and they know too little rather than too much about ancient knowledge; Fourth, there is no antagonistic contradiction between the ancient and the modern. The "present" has developed from the "past," and if we "slight the past," we would be forgetting our roots.

Then, represented by student Lü Huiwen, those who advocated "favoring the present and slighting the past" immediately rose to debate. They argued that "favoring the present and slighting the past" was raised in response to real problems. There is a serious tendency to "favor the past and slight the present" within the department. To completely reverse this tendency, we should "favor the present and slight the past." They said that we hear more "ancient voices" and fewer "modern voices" in the classroom; there are more ancient literature courses and fewer modern ones; teachers also tend to focus on classical literature in their writing and scientific research. It is in response to this situation that we agree with Comrade Chen Boda's policy of "favoring the present and slighting the past." The main spirit of "favoring the present and slighting the past" is that everything should serve the present. To promote the development of today's culture, we must inherit the excellent classical cultural heritage. The word "slight" in "favoring the present and slighting the past" does not mean "belittling" or "negating" the past in the slightest. However, it must be emphasized that the "present" is primary and the "past" is secondary, and the "past" should serve the "present." Therefore, "favoring the past and slighting the present" confuses the primary and secondary.

After heated debate, more and more students supported "favoring the present and slighting the past." At this time, some people proposed "respecting the present and inheriting the past." They basically agreed with the opinion of "favoring the present and slighting the past," but believed that the formulation of "favoring the present and slighting the past" was not clear and comprehensive enough. Those who advocated "favoring the present and slighting the past" immediately engaged in a fierce debate with them. As a result, they finally abandoned their opinion because there was no difference in principle. However, the arguments of those who advocated "favoring the past and slighting the present" and those who advocated "favoring the present and slighting the past" are still deadlocked, and they are gathering materials to prepare for a deeper debate.

At the debate in the History Department, some people proposed the theory of "being learned in the past and understanding the present." They said that only by "being learned in the past" can one "understand the present," and to "understand the present" one must "be learned in the past." Some people also proposed the theory of "emphasizing both China and foreign countries," believing that while emphasizing the study of Chinese history, we should also strengthen the study of world history. These statements aroused much debate among teachers and students. Many teachers and students said that the essence of the theories of "being learned in the past and understanding the present" and "emphasizing both China and foreign countries" is still "favoring the past and slighting the present," which also proves that the tendency of "favoring the past and slighting the present" in the historical field is indeed serious. Many people said that history is a science with a strong class nature, and the study of history must serve the economic base and serve the current class struggle and production construction. They cited examples in this regard: Chen Boda's "Yuan Shikai, the Thief of the Country," and Hu Sheng's "Imperialism and Chinese Politics," both closely linked the study of history with the real struggle. Engels is even a model in this regard. Isn't his "From Ape to Man" and "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" completely serving the cause of proletarian liberation?

The debate in the science departments began with different views on work-study programs. One side in the debate said that the basic direction of work-study programs is wrong. For example, spending a dozen hours a week working in metal and wood factories does not bring the ideological feelings of workers and peasants, and cannot make one "red"; similarly, because work-study programs take up time, they also affect the quality of learning and affect specialization. The other side of the debate vividly cited that many students participate in work-study programs, are energetic, study diligently, and not only do well in their studies, but also excel in social work. Their common experience is that they have open minds and are in a good mood, and they have energy to do everything. Moreover, work-study programs are closely integrated with their majors. Some students in the Biology Department believe that the separation of theory and practice is determined by the social division of labor. Universities are not like factories. Specializing in theory is our specialty, and producing knowledge is the specialty of workers. However, many teachers and students disagreed with the above views. They said that today we are taking the path of working-class intellectuals, which should be fundamentally distinguished from the path of old experts. Today's teaching and scientific work must start from the needs of the country and face production.

In this heated debate, various viewpoints and opinions have gradually converged into two opposing camps. In dormitories, classrooms, and even dining halls, teachers and students are working together to find arguments in depth and consult with each other. Their attitude is that they will never easily give up their own viewpoints until the truth has been clarified.

### 厚今薄古还是厚古薄今？  复旦大学师生展开大辩论

    厚今薄古还是厚古薄今？
    复旦大学师生展开大辩论
    本报讯　据解放日报报道：在五万多张教学专题鸣放大字报的基础上，一个从根本上革新教学、改造思想的大论战在复旦大学热烈展开。
    3月28日，中文系三年级同学揭开了大辩论的序幕。辩论的中心是“厚今薄古”还是“厚古薄今”的问题。30日便发展成为全系师生的大辩论会。
    辩论开始，主张“厚古薄今”的人提出了 四个主要论点，他们认为：第一、我国历史悠久，文化遗产丰富；第二、如果“薄古”，在今天研究古代文化的人才十分缺乏的情况下，将会导致文化遗产的“后继无人”；第三、从目前中文系同学的水平看来，掌握古籍是不够的，对古代知识不是知道得太多而是太少；第四、古今不存在对抗性的矛盾，“今”是由“古”发展而来的，如果“薄古”，就是忘本。
    接着以吕恢文同学为代表主张“厚今薄古”的马上起来辩论。他们认为“厚今薄古”是针对现实中的问题提出来的，在系里就存在着严重的“厚古薄今”倾向，为了彻底扭转这种倾向，应该“厚今薄古”。他们说，在课堂上听到的“古代声音”多，“现代的声音”少；文学课程古代的多、现代的少；教师写文章、搞科学研究也偏重于古典文学，正是针对这种情况，我们同意陈伯达同志提出的“厚今薄古”的方针。所谓“厚今薄古”，主要精神是：一切要为今天服务，要想推动今天文化的发展，必须继承优秀的古典文化遗产；“厚今薄古”的“薄”字丝毫没有“轻”古或“非”古的意思。但是必须强调，“今”是主要的，“古”是次要的，“古”应该为“今”服务。因此，“厚古薄今”是主次不分。
    经过热烈争辩，拥护“厚今薄古”的同学越来越多。这时又出现了主张“荣今继古”的人，他们基本上同意“厚今薄古”的意见，但认为“厚今薄古”的提法还不明确，不全面。主张“厚今薄古”的立即和他们展开激烈的辩论，结果他们终于以没有原则分歧而放弃了他们的意见。但是，主张“厚古薄今”与主张“厚今薄古”的人，双方论点仍在相持不下，正纷纷收集资料，准备继续深入地展开辩论。
    在历史系的辩论大会上，有人提出了“博古通今”论。他们说，“博古”才能“通今”，“通今”必须“博古”。也有人提出了“中外并重”论，认为在强调中国史研究的同时，还要加强世界史的研究。这些说法，引起很多师生的争辩。很多教师和学生发言说，“博古通今”“中外并重”论的实质仍旧是“厚古薄今”，这也证明史学界的“厚古薄今”倾向确是严重存在着的。许多人发言说，历史学是一门阶级性很强的科学，研究历史必须为经济基础服务，为当前的阶级斗争和生产建设服务，他们举出这方面的例子：陈伯达写“窃国大盗袁世凯”，胡绳写“帝国主义与中国政治”，都是把对历史的研究和现实斗争密切联系起来，恩格斯更是这方面的典范，他的“从猿到人”、“家族、私有财产及国家的起源”不是完全为无产阶级的解放事业服务的吗？
    理科的辩论是从对勤工俭学的各种分歧看法开始的。辩论的一方说，勤工俭学的基本方向错了，譬如一个星期拿出十几个小时到金工厂木工厂作工，这并不能带来工农的思想感情，不能红；同样由于勤工俭学占去了时间，也影响了学习质量，影响了专。辩论的另一方则生动地列举出有许多同学参加勤工俭学，精神振作，学习勤奋，不但使学习搞得好，社会工作也作得出色，他们的共同体会是：思想开朗，心情舒畅，不论做什么事都有劲道，而且勤工俭学是与专业紧密结合的。生物系有的学生则认为理论与实际分家是社会分工决定的。大学不比工厂，搞理论是我们的专，生产知识是工人的专。但是有许多教师和同学都不同意上述看法，他们说，我们今天走的是工人阶级知识分子的道路，这与旧专家的道路应从根本上区别开来。今天的教学、科学工作必须从国家需要出发，面向生产。
    在这场热火朝天的大辩论中，各种各样的论点、见解已逐渐汇合成两个对峙的营垒。在寝室、课堂以至饭厅里，教师与同学一起，继续深入寻找论据，互相磋商，他们的态度是：在真理还没有辩明之前，决不轻易放弃自己的论点。
