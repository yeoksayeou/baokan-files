    "Vanguard II" Has No Way to Heaven
    American-Launched Satellite Plunges into the Sea
    Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: Cape Canaveral (USA) News: The U.S. Navy made another fool of itself on the night of April 28th at Cape Canaveral when it launched the so-called "Vanguard II" artificial satellite. The satellite failed to enter orbit because the third-stage rocket did not ignite, and it, along with the second and third stages, fell into the rolling waves of the Atlantic Ocean east of the West Indies.
    This "Vanguard II" artificial satellite was basketball-shaped, 20 inches in diameter, and weighed 21.5 pounds (3 inches smaller in diameter and one-ninth the weight of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite). A three-stage rocket was used to launch the satellite. The satellite was only equipped with an instrument to measure X-rays in sunlight and a radio transmitter. The United States originally boasted that if this satellite was successfully launched, it would be the fourth American satellite in the sky. Before the launch, the Washington government put on airs, preparing to issue a statement two hours after the satellite went into space. Hagen, the head of the "Vanguard Program," nervously kept calling the launch center from the laboratory to inquire about the news. However, half an hour after the rocket was launched, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington dejectedly announced the launch failure. The U.S. Department of Defense said that it appeared there was "no chance" of recovering the fallen rocket and artificial satellite.

    “先锋二号”上天无路
    美国发射的卫星坠入大海
    据新华社29日讯　卡纳维拉尔角（美国）消息：美国海军28日夜间在卡纳维拉尔角发射所谓“先锋二号”人造卫星时，又出了一次丑。卫星因第三级火箭不燃烧而上不了轨道，连同第二、第三级火箭一齐掉到西印度群岛以东的大西洋滚滚海涛中去了。
    这个“先锋二号”人造卫星呈篮球形，直径二十英寸，重二十一磅半（直径比苏联第一个人造卫星小三英寸，重量只有它的九分之一）。用来发射卫星的是一个三级火箭。卫星上只装有一架能测定太阳光中X射线的仪器和一个无线电发射机。原来美国吹嘘这个卫星如果发射成功，它将是美国在天空的第四个卫星。发射前，华盛顿政府当局摆着架势，准备在卫星上天后二小时发表声明，“先锋计划”负责人哈根紧张地在实验室里不断给发射中心打电话问消息。可是，火箭发射半小时后，华盛顿的美国海军实验室就沮丧地宣布发射失败，美国国防部说：要找回掉落的火箭和人造卫星看来是“没有任何机会”了。
