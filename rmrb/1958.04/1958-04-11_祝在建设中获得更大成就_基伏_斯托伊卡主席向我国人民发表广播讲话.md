    Wishing Greater Achievements in Construction
    Chairman Chivu Stoica Delivers Radio Address to Our People

    Xinhua News Agency, April 10th.  Romanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Chivu Stoica, at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station, delivered a radio address to the Chinese people, which was broadcast on the evening of the 10th. The full text of the speech is as follows: Dear comrades and friends,

    I take this pleasant opportunity to say a few words to the Chinese people through the radio station, and to convey to you the warm greetings of the Romanian government delegation and the friendly and fraternal greetings of the Romanian people.

    In these past few days, we have gained extremely profound impressions in China. Through everything we have seen, we can better understand the scale of the historical changes taking place on the vast land of China in the era of the people's regime, and understand the achievements you have made in developing the economy and culture, and in turning your country into a great socialist power, as well as the achievements you are currently making.

    On important construction sites across the country, in the huge water conservancy projects and afforestation work that are changing the natural landscape of some areas, and in the construction of factories, workers' residences, and social and cultural institutions in People's China, enormous efforts are required, and the Chinese people have proven that they are capable of making such efforts. The contact between our government delegation and the Chinese working masses has proven the enthusiasm and patriotic fervor of the Chinese people that we already knew, their high degree of political consciousness, organization, and discipline, and the determination of the builders of New China—workers, peasants, intellectuals, youth, the elderly, men and women—to implement the resolutions of the Chinese Communist Party and the government. We will forever remember the unity of the Chinese people, who follow the great Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong with trust and love. The work and struggle of the Chinese Communist Party is full of the lessons of creatively applying Marxist-Leninist doctrine under China's specific conditions.

    During our visit, the care and hospitality we received everywhere from the Chinese working people, the leaders of the state and the Party, will be unforgettable. For this, please accept our thanks. Being with you is like being with true friends and brothers. This is quite natural, because the people of our two countries equally belong to the great family of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. They are moving forward closely united by the common ideas, common interests and goals of Marxism-Leninism—building socialism and defending peace. Like the Chinese people, the Romanian people consider it their primary international obligation to contribute to strengthening the solidarity and unity among the socialist camp countries.

    Dear comrades and friends, we came to your country to better understand each other and to further strengthen the fraternal mutual assistance, cooperation, and unbreakable friendship between our two countries. Now, as we conclude our visit, we would like to express our satisfaction with this fruitful visit. Our talks with your excellent leaders demonstrated a consensus of views on the issues discussed, whether they were current international political issues or the development of friendship and multifaceted cooperation between Romania and China.

    Before leaving your beautiful capital, Beijing, we bid farewell to the citizens of your capital and sincerely wish all the Chinese people greater achievements in the struggle to build socialism and defend peace.

    祝在建设中获得更大成就
    基伏·斯托伊卡主席向我国人民发表广播讲话
    新华社10日讯　罗马尼亚部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡应中央人民广播电台的邀请向中国人民发表广播讲话，这个讲话已在10日晚上广播。讲话的全文如下：亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我趁这个令人感到愉快的机会，通过广播电台向中国人民讲几句话，向你们转达罗马尼亚政府代表团的热烈的敬意以及罗马尼亚人民的友谊的和兄弟般的问候。
    这几天来，我们在中国所获得的印象是极其深刻的。通过我们所看到的一切，我们能更好地了解到在中国广大土地上，在人民政权年代里所进行的具有历史性的改变的规模，了解到你们在发展经济和文化，并且把你们的国家变成一个社会主义大国的工作中过去所获得的成就和现在正在获得的成就。
    在全国范围内的重要建设工地上，在改变一些地区的自然面貌的巨大水利工程和造林工作中，在人民中国的工厂企业、工人住宅和社会文化机关的建设工作中，都需要巨大的努力，而中国人民证明他们是能够做出这样的努力的。我们政府代表团跟中国工人群众的接触，证明了我们已经知道的中国人民的热情和爱国的热忱，他们高度的政治自觉性、组织性和纪律性，新中国建设者们——工人、农民、知识分子、青年、老人、男人和妇女——贯彻中国共产党和政府决议的决心。我们永远铭记着中国人民的团结，他们以信任和热爱的心情跟随着以毛泽东同志为首的伟大共产党。中国共产党的工作和斗争充满着在中国具体条件下创造性地运用马克思列宁主义学说的教益。
    在我们访问期间，中国劳动人民、国家和党领导人到处给予我们的关怀和款待，我们将经久不忘。为此，请接受我们的谢意。跟你们在一起，就好像跟真正的朋友和兄弟在一起。这是十分自然的事情，因为我们两国人民同样地属于以苏联为首的社会主义国家的大家庭。他们以马克思列宁主义的共同思想、共同利益和目标——建设社会主义和保卫和平——而紧密团结一致地向前迈进。罗马尼亚人民跟中国人民一样，认为对加强社会主义阵营各国之间的团结一致作出贡献是他们首要的国际义务。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，我们来到你们的国家，为了更好地相互了解，更加加强我们两国之间的兄弟般的互助合作和牢不可破的友谊。现在在我们结束访问之际，我们想表达对我们这次富有成果的访问的满意心情。我们跟你们优秀的领袖们的会谈，表现了对所讨论到的问题的一致看法，不论是目前的国际政治问题，或者是发展罗中两国的友谊和多方面的合作。
    在离开你们美丽的祖国首都北京以前，我们向你们首都市民告别，并衷心地祝全中国人民在建设社会主义和保卫和平的斗争中获得更大的成就。
