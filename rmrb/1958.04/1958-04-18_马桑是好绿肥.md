　　Horse-mulberry is Good Green Manure

　　In the rural areas of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shanxi, Henan, Gansu and other provinces, there is a wild shrub called horse-mulberry (called Du Xun in the Miao language), which is a very good green manure tree. Farmers often cut the tender branches and leaves of horse-mulberry every spring and winter, directly plowing them into the fields or piling them in ponds to ferment into fertilizer. According to comparative tests, the fertilizing effect of 100 catties of horse-mulberry leaves is equivalent to one load of top-quality night soil or two dry cakes.

　　The tender branches and leaves of horse-mulberry are rich in organic matter. When applied to sticky paddy fields, they can promote soil loosening; when applied to sandy fields, they can form a granular structure and enhance the soil's water retention capacity. Horse-mulberry leaves, dried and ground into powder, mixed with fresh rice straw ash, can also kill rice seedling leaf beetles.

　　Horse-mulberry has strong adaptability and disease resistance, and is drought-resistant and cold-resistant. It can grow on barren mountain tops, slopes, and areas with soil erosion. It can be propagated in spring by direct seeding, cuttings, division of roots, and division of medicinal parts. Afforestation by cuttings is the fastest. Usually, it can grow to one or two chi in one year, and branches and leaves can be cut for fertilizer in the second year. (Mu Ren)

    马桑是好绿肥
    在湖南、湖北、四川、云南、山西、河南、甘肃等省农村，有一种名叫马桑（苗语叫杜迅）的野生灌木，它是一种很好的绿肥树。农民每年春季和冬季打青，常割取马桑的嫩枝叶，直接犁翻在田里或堆在凼里沤制成肥。据试验比较，一百斤马桑叶的肥效，可抵一担头等大粪或两个枯饼。
    马桑的嫩枝叶含有机质丰富，施在粘泥田里，能促使土壤松软；施在沙泥田里又能形成团粒结构，增强土壤保水能力。马桑树叶晒干后捣成粉末，混合新鲜稻草灰，还能杀死禾苗负泥虫。
    马桑的适应性和抗病力强，耐旱耐寒，在贫瘠的山顶、山坡和水土流失的地方都能生长，可以在春季用直播、插条、分根、分药等方法繁殖。以插条造林最快，通常一年就可长到一、二尺高，第二年就可割取枝叶作肥料。　（牧人）
