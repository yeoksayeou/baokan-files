    Chad's Struggle for National Independence

    France divided its vast colonies in Central Africa into French Equatorial Africa and French West Africa, which were further subdivided into several regions. Chad is the northernmost of the four regions of French Equatorial Africa.

    Representatives of the Chadian people, who are striving for independence, attended the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held at the end of last year. The head of the delegation exposed the colonial atrocities of French imperialism at the conference. He pointed out that France divided Equatorial Africa into four parts and forcibly established a puppet government in each part, which is an old trick of imperialism to "divide and rule." In the resolution on imperialism, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference declared: "The conference endorses and supports the Chadian people's struggle to free their country from French rule and achieve independence."

    Chad is a vast and sparsely populated country. It accounts for more than half of the total area of French Equatorial Africa, with a total of 1,284,000 square kilometers, one-third larger than Pakistan, but with a population of only over 2.5 million. It is one of the most sparsely populated regions on Earth. The vast majority of residents are Black Africans, 61% of whom are Muslim.

    One-third of Chad is desert, arid and open, extending north into the Sahara Desert. The southern region is a dry, sparsely wooded tropical savanna.

    Most of Chad's residents are engaged in animal husbandry, with a total of about three million livestock, concentrated around Lake Chad. Rice and peanuts are also grown. However, in recent years, in order to seize huge profits, French monopoly capital has forced the residents of southern Chad to grow cotton. Cotton has become a single crop in this area. It is estimated that there are now about 450,000 cotton farmers. All the cotton produced is monopolized and purchased at low prices by the French African Cotton Association, becoming the basic export commodity of French Equatorial Africa other than timber. The food crops needed for people's livelihood have been completely squeezed out.

    The people of Chad and the people of the entire French Equatorial Africa have carried out a long and resolute resistance and struggle since the French colonialists began to invade their homeland in the 19th century. The French colonialists did not conquer the Karen region in central Chad until 1906, nor did they conquer the Wadai region in the east until 1912, and the Borku region in northern Chad was not completely occupied by the French colonialists until 1914, when the First World War broke out. However, the flames of people's struggle still existed. The people of Darroti in Chad even held an uprising in 1921 to resist French colonial rule.

    After the Second World War, the national independence struggle of the entire French Equatorial Africa, including the Chad region, entered a new stage. The people's forces in various regions have become more united, cooperating and supporting each other. Mass organizations such as the "African Democratic Union" and the "General Confederation of Labor of Equatorial Africa" have been established one after another.

    The national independence struggle of the people of the Chad region is closely related to the national liberation movement in Equatorial Africa and the entire French Africa. Recently, the Chadian people launched a large-scale donation campaign to support the struggle of the Algerian people. The underground organization leading the Chad independence movement also mobilized the people to resist French conscription in Chad. The French colonial authorities arrested many people who donated money, some of whom are still in prison. The residents of Modo City refused to pay taxes to the colonial authorities, and the French imperialists inhumanely set fire to the entire city.

    In February last year, France decided to establish thirteen so-called "semi-autonomous republics" in French West Africa, French Equatorial Africa and Madagascar, including the establishment of the "Republic of Chad." On March 31 of the same year, so-called "local council" elections were held in various regions. However, the number of people participating in the voting in each region was less than half. The result of the vote in Chad was that the "Party in Favor of Adopting the (French) Territory Law" won 64 of the 65 seats in the "local council." However, as the Chadian people have seen through, these measures are nothing more than a deceptive trick.

### 乍得的民族独立斗争

    乍得的民族独立斗争
    法国把它在非洲中部的广大殖民地分成法属赤道非洲和法属西非洲两部分，它们下面又分划成许多地区。乍得是法属赤道非洲的四个地区中最北部的一个。
    争取独立的乍得人民的代表出席了去年年底召开的亚非人民团结大会。代表团的团长在大会上揭露了法帝国主义的殖民暴行。他指出：法国把赤道非洲分割为四部分，并且在每一部分强行设置一个伪政府，这是帝国主义的“分而治之”的旧手法。亚非人民团结大会在关于帝国主义的决议中宣布：“大会赞同和支持乍得人民使自己的国家摆脱法国统治而取得独立的斗争。”
    乍得是地广人稀的国土。它占法属赤道非洲全面积的一半以上，共一百二十八万四千平方公里，比巴基斯坦还大三分之一，但人口只有二百五十多万。它是地球上人口密度最稀的地区之一。居民绝大多数是非洲黑人，其中有61％信仰伊斯兰教。
    乍得三分之一的地区是沙漠，它干旱空旷，向北延伸入撒哈拉大沙漠。南部地区是干涸少树的热带草原。
    乍得的居民大多以牧畜为生，牲畜总数约三百万头，集中在乍得湖一带。此外还种植一些大米和花生。但是，近年来，法国垄断资本为了掠取巨额利润，强迫乍得南部居民种植棉花，棉花成为这一带的单一作物，现在，棉农人数估计约达四十五万，所生产的棉花全部为法属非洲棉花协会以低价垄断收购，成为法属赤道非洲除木材以外的基本出口商品。人民生活所需的粮食作物被挤得干干净净。
    乍得人民和整个法属赤道非洲的人民，从十九世纪法国殖民主义者开始侵入他们的家园起，进行了长期的坚决的反抗和斗争。法国殖民者在1906年才征服乍得中部的卡伦地区，1912年才征服东部的瓦戴地区，而乍得北部的波尔库地区直到第一次世界大战发生的1914年，才被法国殖民者全部占领。可是人民的斗争火焰依然存在，乍得的达罗梯地方的人民在1921年还举行起义，以反抗法国的殖民统治。
    第二次世界大战以后，整个法属赤道非洲，包括乍得地区人民的民族独立斗争，进入了新的阶段。各个地区的人民力量更加统一起来，互相配合和支援。有广泛群众性的“非洲民主联盟”、“赤道非洲总工会”等组织先后建立起来了。
    乍得地区人民的民族独立斗争是和赤道非洲以及整个法属非洲的民族解放运动休戚相关的。最近，乍得人民曾经举行大规模的捐款运动，来支援阿尔及利亚人民的斗争，领导乍得独立运动的地下组织并发动人民抵制法国在乍得征兵。法国殖民当局逮捕了不少捐款的群众，其中有的至今还被关在牢里。摩多城的居民拒绝向殖民当局交税，法帝国主义者竟然灭绝人性地纵火焚烧了整个城市。
    去年2月，法国决定在法属西非、法属赤道非洲和马达加斯加建立十三个所谓“半自治共和国”，其中包括建立“乍得共和国”。同年3月31日，在各个地区举行所谓“地方议会”的选举。但是，各地区参加投票的人数都不到半数。在乍得的投票结果是：“地方议会”的六十五席中，由“赞同采用（法国）领域法党”获得六十四席。然而这些措施，正如乍得人民所识破的，无非是一场骗人的花招罢了。
