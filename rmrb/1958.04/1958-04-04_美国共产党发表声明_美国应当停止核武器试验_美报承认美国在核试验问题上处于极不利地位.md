    Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd - According to TASS, New York, April 2nd: Dennis, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, issued a statement to the press on behalf of the National Committee regarding the Soviet Union's decision to cease nuclear weapons testing:
    The statement said that peace-loving people around the world welcome the Soviet Union's historically significant action of unilaterally ceasing nuclear weapons testing. The United States, the first country to drop atomic bombs, should have been the first to stop testing. However, despite the growing number of Americans of different political views calling for such a policy, the US government has failed to implement it. The statement said that the United States should make a significant contribution to the cause of peace by ceasing atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, particularly by canceling the planned tests in the Marshall Islands.
    The statement condemned the US State Department, headed by Secretary of State Dulles, for disregarding the will of the people and adopting a cold attitude towards ceasing nuclear weapons testing and convening a summit meeting as soon as possible. The statement said that the American people should now use their mass organizations—unions, churches, and mass groups—to make Washington feel their desire: to stop atomic and hydrogen bomb testing and ban nuclear weapons; to convene a summit meeting immediately and expand trade and cultural ties with socialist countries. In general, to implement a firm national policy of peaceful coexistence, because this policy is the only basis for preventing nuclear war and building lasting peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd - According to TASS, New York, April 2nd: Many American newspapers, commenting on the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing, fiercely criticized the US government for being in an extremely unfavorable position in the eyes of world public opinion. However, only a few newspapers called on the government to change its policy and follow the Soviet Union's example by announcing the abandonment of nuclear weapons testing.
    "The New York Times" editorial accused the State Department of hastily rejecting the Soviet Union's decision. The newspaper warned that the State Department's statement on the issue would have "negligible impact on the world compared to the psychological explosion caused by the Russian decision."
    "The New York Post" said that the United States "suffered a more tragic defeat than the one brought about by the satellite," and it said: "Few American social figures are willing to admit the scale of this tragedy."

    美国共产党发表声明
    美国应当停止核武器试验
    美报承认美国在核试验问题上处于极不利地位
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约2日讯：美国共产党全国委员会总书记丹尼斯代表全国委员会就苏联停止试验核武器的决定向报界发表声明：
    声明说，全世界爱好和平的人们欢迎苏联单方面停止试验核武器这一具有历史意义的行动。第一个投掷原子弹的美国本应首先停止试验。但是尽管越来越多的不同政治观点的美国人要求执行这种方针，美国政府却没有实现这一点。声明说，美国应当对和平事业作出巨大贡献，它应当停止原子弹和氢弹试验，特别是取消预定在马绍尔群岛进行的试验。
    声明谴责以国务卿杜勒斯为首的美国国务院违背人民意志，在停止试验核武器和尽快召开最高级会议方面采取冷漠的态度。声明说，美国人民现在应当通过自己的群众组织——工会、教会和群众团体来使华盛顿感觉到他们的愿望：停止试验原子弹和氢弹以及禁止核武器；立即召开最高级会议和同社会主义国家扩大贸易和文化联系。总起来说，就是执行和平共处的坚定的民族政策，因为这种政策是防止核战争和建立持久和平的唯一基础。
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约2日讯：美国许多报纸在评论苏联关于单方面停止试验核武器的决定时，激烈抨击美国政府在世界公众面前处于极端不利地位。但是，只有不多几家报纸要求政府改变它的政策和效法苏联的榜样，宣布放弃核武器试验。
    “纽约时报”的社论指责国务院匆忙拒绝苏联的决定。这家报纸警告说，国务院就这个问题发表的声明对全世界的影响“同俄国人的决定所造成的心理爆炸相比将是微不足道的”。
    “纽约邮报”说，美国“遭到了比卫星给它带来的失败更悲惨的失败”，它并且说：“很少有那一位美国社会人士愿意承认这一惨剧的规模”。
