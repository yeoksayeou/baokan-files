　　“Anton's Love”
　　What is true happiness? How should young people treat love? The Soviet film "Anton's Love" answers this question through the love story of the protagonist Anton.
　　The film is adapted from Andreyev's novel "The Flood." Anton is a hard-working and energetic stoker, but because he mistakenly falls in love with Lyusha, a female student who pursues vanity, his spirit suffers, and his production slackens. Under the education and help of the Party Committee Secretary, he gradually realizes the truth that "if love cannot help work and life, it is not worth cherishing," and returns to the correct path in life. Finally, he marries Dania, who truly loves and cares for him, and obtains true happiness. (Yuan Xin)

     “安东的爱情”
    什么才是真正的幸福？青年们应该怎样对待爱情？苏联影片“安东的爱情”通过主人翁安东的恋爱故事，回答了这个问题。
    影片是根据安德列耶夫的小说“洪流”改编摄制的。安东是一个热爱工作、朝气勃勃的司炉工人，但由于他错误地爱上了一个追求虚荣的女学生柳霞，精神受到苦痛，生产泄劲了。在党委书记的教育帮助下，他逐渐认识到“假如爱情不能帮助工作和生活，这种爱情就不值得珍惜”的道理，重新走上了正确的生活道路，最后和真正爱他、关心他的丹妮雅结合了，获得了真正的幸福。　（袁心）
