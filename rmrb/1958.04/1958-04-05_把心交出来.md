    Hand Over Your Heart
    Yang Dongchun

    The first article of the socialist self-reform covenant for democratic parties and non-party democrats: "Transform your political stance, hand over your heart, and resolutely follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." The most important part of this article is the five words "hand over your heart."

    Handing over your heart is essentially a matter of political stance. Whether you can hand over your heart, whether you hand it over completely or partially, will be a serious test of your political stance. The core of handing over your heart is: to whom do you hand over your heart? The answer is: to the Party, to the working class, to the people, to socialism. Therefore, handing over your heart is a question of your basic attitude towards the Party, the working class, the people, and socialism.

    Handing over your heart and resolving to engage in self-reform are interrelated: the more thorough and courageous you are in handing over your heart, the greater and more firm your resolve will be; conversely, the greater and more firm your resolve, the more thorough and courageous you will be in handing over your heart. The two are unified: there is no one who can resolve to self-reform without handing over their heart, and there is no one who resolves to self-reform but is unwilling or afraid to hand over their heart.

    Handing over your heart is the way to live and conduct oneself in a socialist society. It is the concrete manifestation of the relationship between people in a socialist society, that is, "I for everyone, everyone for me," and it is the concrete manifestation of the working class's noble qualities such as frankness, simplicity, loyalty, and honesty. It is also the premise for correctly handling contradictions among the people. Speaking circuitously, ambiguously, not stating what you approve of or what you oppose; watching the wind and steering the boat, echoing others, having no opinion on this or that, but in fact having many opinions, just not "lifting the lid"; not speaking to people's faces, speaking badly behind their backs, agreeing to their faces, opposing behind their backs, saying yes to their faces, grumbling behind their backs; and observing people's expressions, trying to figure out their intentions, and flattering them – all these are the bad habits of backstabbing and deceiving each other from the old society, the most essential signs of the old society's utter corruption. This kind of bourgeois "philosophy of life" is fundamentally incompatible with life in a socialist society. Living in a socialist society requires discarding these things. Cleanly discarding these old things and earnestly handing over your heart are necessary to adapt to the new relationships between people in a socialist society and to establish new morals and new styles of being open and sincere with each other.

    It should be understood that handing over your heart means that everyone should hand over their heart, not that someone should hand over their heart while someone else can choose not to. The ancients said, "Hearts resonate with each other"; and also, "The value of knowing a person lies in knowing their heart." It seems that the key to good relations lies in the word "mutual."

    It should be understood that not only should you hand over your heart in this great leap forward of socialist self-reform, but you should also hand over your heart anytime, anywhere in the future, and you should hand over your heart forever. Truly achieving what the ancients said, having a broad and open mind, "never shaming oneself in a dark room."

    If everyone can hand over their heart and do so forever, it will certainly play a good role in correctly resolving contradictions among the people, uniting 600 million people into one heart, and providing a reliable guarantee for socialist construction.

    Handing over your heart is easy to say but difficult to do. It is easy if you can put down your stinking airs, if you can throw away that so-called glorious face that is not glorious at all, and if you can bear the pain of saying goodbye to your old self; otherwise, it is difficult. It should be affirmed that the process of handing over your heart is a process of understanding, a process of self-reform, that is, a process of self-struggle. If you do not recognize this point, it is difficult to say that there are no problems with the heart you hand over; and if there is a problem, it will definitely affect your determination to transform your stance and ideology. In this way, you are not only disloyal to the Party and the people, but also disloyal to yourself. A disloyal person will never have peace of mind. A disloyal person may deceive others and himself to get through the current hurdle, but he will certainly not get through the many hurdles ahead, and in the end, he is likely to fall heavily and destroy himself.

    The moment when the Party and the people test us has arrived. It is a test of whether we are determined to follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Party. First, we see whether we can hand over our heart, whether we hand it over completely or partially. Whoever can withstand this test has the potential to withstand all kinds of tests in the future. We are at a critical juncture: on the one hand, the situation is pressing; on the other hand, time waits for no one. There is only one socialist road ahead, with no room for maneuver and no way to retreat. When advancing on the socialist road, those who recognize the situation and seize the time should first earnestly, completely, and unreservedly hand over their hearts to the Party, to the people, and to socialism!

### 把心交出来

    把心交出来
    杨东莼
    民主党派和无党派民主人士社会主义自我改造公约第一条：“改造政治立场，把心交出来，在中国共产党的领导下，坚决走社会主义道路。”这一条里，最重要的是“把心交出来”五个字。
    把心交出来，实质上是一个政治立场问题。能否把心交出来，是整个地交还是部分地交，这对自己的政治立场将是一次严重的考验。把心交出来，问题的核心是：心交给谁？答复是：交给党，交给工人阶级，交给人民，交给社会主义。因此，把心交出来，是一个对待党、对待工人阶级、对待人民、对待社会主义的基本态度问题。
    交出心来和对自我改造下定决心，有着相互的关系：交心越彻底、越勇敢，则决心越大、越坚定；反过来说，决心越大、越坚定，交心就会越彻底、越勇敢。两者是统一的：决没有不交出心来而能痛下决心者，也没有下定了决心而不愿或者不敢交出心来者。
    把心交出来，是社会主义社会立身处世之道，是社会主义社会人与人的关系，即我为人人、人人为我的关系的具体表现，是工人阶级坦率、质朴、忠诚、老实等高贵品质的具体表现，同时也是正确地处理人民内部矛盾的前提。说话拐弯抹角，模棱两可，不表明自己赞成什么，反对什么；看风使舵，人云亦云，对这没意见，对那也没意见，其实意见很多，就是不“揭盖子”；当面不说，背后大说，当面赞成，背后反对，当面诺诺，背后咕哝；以及察言观色、揣摩逢迎等等，都是旧社会勾心斗角、尔虞我诈的恶劣作风，是旧社会糜烂透顶的最本质的标志。这种资产阶级的“处世哲学”，同社会主义社会的生活是根本不相容的。生活在社会主义社会里，非把这些东西丢掉不可。干干净净地丢掉这些旧东西，认真地交出心来，这样，才能适应社会主义社会人与人之间的新关系，才能树立彼此披肝沥胆、相见以诚的新道德和新作风。
    应当这样理解：把心交出来，是说人人都该把心交出来，而不是说某人该交出来，某人可以不交出来。古人说：“心心相印”；又说：“人之相知，贵相知心。”看来，文章贵在一个“相”字。
    应当这样理解：不仅在这次社会主义自我改造大跃进中要把心交出来，并且今后随时随地都应当把心交出来，应当永远地把心交出来。真正做到古人所说的，胸怀坦荡，“一生不侮暗室”。
    人人能够把心交出来，并做到永远把心交出来，就一定能够对正确地解决人民内部矛盾起着良好的作用，使六亿人变成一条心，众志成城，为社会主义建设事业提供可靠的保证。
    把心交出来，说易便易，说难便难。能够放下臭架子，能够抛掉那自以为光采而实际并不光采的面子，能够忍痛同旧我话别，就容易；否则就难。应当肯定：交心的过程，乃是一个认识过程、一个自我改造过程，即一个自我斗争的过程。不认识这一点，交出来的心很难说没有问题；而一有问题，则一定会影响自己对立场改造、思想改造的决心。这样，不仅对党、对人民不忠实，并且对自己也不忠实，不忠实的人，将永远坐卧不宁，心情也舒畅不了。不忠实的人，欺人自欺地滑过了当前这一关，但一定滑不过今后的许多关，到头来，很可能摔一大跤，把自己毁灭掉。
    党和人民考验我们的时刻到了。考验我们有无决心在党的领导下走社会主义道路。首先看我们能否交出心来，是整个地交还是部分地交。谁经得起这一场考验，谁就有可能经得起以后的种种考验。我们正处在一个紧要关头：一方面是形势逼人，另一方面是时不我与。前面只有一条社会主义的道路，没有回旋的余地，也没有退缩的后路。在向社会主义道路前进的时候，认识形势和争取时间的人，首先就应当向党、向人民、向社会主义认真地整个地毫无保留地把心交出来！
