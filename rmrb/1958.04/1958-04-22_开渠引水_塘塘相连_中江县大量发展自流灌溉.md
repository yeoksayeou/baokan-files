    Dig Canals to Divert Water, Ponds Linked Together
    Zhongjiang County Massively Develops Self-Flow Irrigation
    (Our Dispatch) Sichuan's Zhongjiang County has changed from digging ponds to wait for rain to diverting water to irrigate ponds, and from using waterwheels to self-flow irrigation, greatly increasing its ability to prevent and resist drought.
    More than one-third of Zhongjiang County is historically drought-prone. In the past, the local solution to drought was mainly to dig ponds to store water. By last year, the county already had more than 12,000 ponds, covering an area that accounted for 17% of the irrigated land area, and in some townships even more than 40%; but because they could not hold water, they could not solve the drought problem.
    Since last winter, the Zhongjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China has changed its past policy of repairing ponds to wait for water and has vigorously promoted water lifting and diversion for self-flow irrigation. In a few months, the county installed 158 automatic waterwheel pumps along the river; newly built and expanded more than 100 stone weirs in the upper reaches of the river, and opened many water diversion channels. At the same time, the canals and ponds are linked into an irrigation network, with drainage holes set at different levels in the ponds for self-flow irrigation. Ponds that cannot be connected to water channels are also deepened, and mountain ditches are opened around the mountains to divert water into the ponds, and the ponds at high places and the ponds at low places are connected by ditches to divert and store water. For example, Jixin and Xishan townships jointly built a continuous arch dam in the upper reaches of a river, and opened a water diversion canal more than seven kilometers long along the mountain and connected it to the original 18 ponds, which can self-flow irrigate 2,400 mu of land, and these lands can also be converted to grow two or three crops a year. The Huilong District built a dam across the Kaijiang River and opened a canal more than nine kilometers long, which can release water to self-flow irrigate more than 4,000 mu of land. Now, hydroelectric generators and water pumps are installed on the canal to raise the water and irrigate the ponds, and then the water is released from the ponds into the canal, which can self-flow irrigate another 20,000 mu. By adopting the method of diverting water into the ponds along the mountain ditches and deepening the pond base, not only is the water source guaranteed, but also the land is saved. According to experiments in Jiexing Township, after doing this, the area occupied by the ponds has been reduced from 17% to 7%, freeing up many shallow ponds and abandoned ponds for returning to farmland; the pond mud dug up is added to the sandy land, and more than 3,000 mu of soil has been improved.

### 开渠引水　塘塘相连  中江县大量发展自流灌溉

    开渠引水　塘塘相连
    中江县大量发展自流灌溉
    本报讯　四川中江县改挖塘等雨为引水灌塘，改车水为自流灌溉，大大增加防旱抗旱的力量。
    中江县三分之一以上的地区都是历史上的干旱地区。当地过去解决干旱的办法主要是挖塘等水。到去年止，全县已有一万二千多口塘，占地面积达灌地面积的17％，有的乡甚至达百分之四十几；但因为关不到水，解决不了干旱问题。
    中共中江县委从去年冬季起，就改变了过去修塘等水的方针，大力提倡提水、引水自流灌溉。几个月中，全县就在沿江安装了一百五十八架自动车水的筒车；在河的上游新修、扩建了一百多座石埝，开了许多引水渠道。同时，把渠塘联成灌溉网，在塘中分级设排水洞，放水自流灌溉。不能联结水渠的塘也把它加深，从四周山上开沿山沟引水入塘，并把高处的塘和低处的塘开沟联结，引水储水。如集新、西山两乡联合在一条河的上游修了连拱坝，又依山势开了七公里多长的引水渠和原有的十八口塘相联，就能自流灌田二千四百亩，还可以把这些地改种二季或三季。回龙区在凯江上筑了一道拦河坝，开渠九公里多，就放水自流灌溉四千多亩。现在，又在渠上安水力发电机和抽水机，再把水提高灌塘，从塘中放水入渠，又可以自流灌溉二万亩。由于采用沿山沟引水入塘、加深塘基的办法，不仅保证了水源，也节省了用地。据杰兴乡试验，这样做了以后，塘占地面积已由17％缩小到7％，腾出许多浅塘废塘还田；挖的塘泥加到沙地里，又改良土壤三千多亩。　（王达武）
