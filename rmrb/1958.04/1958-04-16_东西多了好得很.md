It's a Good Thing to Have More Things
Wan Lilang
    After the emergence of the Great Leap Forward on the production front, some comrades in the commercial sector asked, "What if certain products are produced in excess and cannot be sold?" This is a new contradiction in China's current economic life. Some comrades in the Guangzhou commercial sector said, "I support the Great Leap Forward with both hands, but the difficulties are objective." What they mean is that, no matter how you put it, the real problem is that the production of some products has increased, but sales are sluggish (mainly some consumer goods needed by urban people). This thinking is quite representative among employees in the commercial system.
    How should we correctly understand and solve this problem?
    First of all, we must see that we are still not a wealthy country, and the general situation is that there are not too many things, but too few. Increased production after the Great Leap Forward is a great thing, and it is what we are striving for.
    Of course, after production increases, it is possible that some things may be unsalable due to temporary imbalances in supply and demand. What should we do? There are two solutions. One solution is to prevent a leap forward in production in order to achieve a balance between supply and sales, so that the commercial sector does not have to worry about not being able to sell things. Obviously, there's no need to explain that no one would agree to adopt this method.
    Another solution is that, after the leap forward in production, the commercial sector actively purchases and vigorously promotes sales, and temporarily stores commodities that cannot be sold immediately. With the development of production, people's living standards will gradually improve, and there are so many people in our country, and the needs are very large, so there is no need to worry about not being able to sell things. Obviously, this is the best policy.
    The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production has broken the old balance, and commerce must also break the old balance. Otherwise, it will not be able to adapt to the current situation of a comprehensive leap forward, and it will hinder the development of productive forces and affect the leap forward of industry, agriculture, and other undertakings. From the actual situation, our country is so large and there are so many people. It is common for certain commodities to be temporarily excessive or insufficient. Absolute and permanent balance of commodity production and sales is impossible. It can only be from balance to imbalance, and then establish a new balance on a new basis. The current imbalance in commercial purchases and sales is essentially an objective reflection of the imbalance between production and consumption. From the perspective of consumption, in the countryside, farmers are now focusing their money on developing production (purchasing means of production), so less money is spent on consumption, which is a good phenomenon. In cities, under the atmosphere of diligence and thrift, everyone is saving money, which is also a good phenomenon. However, some people oppose normal consumption and saving, and do not even buy legitimate necessities, or regard buying a new piece of clothing or a new pair of shoes as a waste. This is an important reason for the current sluggish sales of consumer goods in the market. This understanding is of course not comprehensive. Things that should be bought should still be bought, which cannot be called waste. In order to build socialism, we advocate hard work and saving all unnecessary expenses to invest in construction; but it is not to ask everyone to give up even legitimate consumption, let alone to reduce people's living standards. Therefore, after appropriate explanation, the sales volume of the market will increase. To overcome this imbalance, from the perspective of commerce itself, the first is to find ways to actively promote sales and effectively play a regulatory role; the second is to promptly reflect the production and sales situation, so that the state can make overall arrangements, and maintain close contact with the industrial sector, so that they can understand the needs of the market, and from the normal market situation, from an overall perspective, make appropriate adjustments to those products that do exceed normal demand.
    Temporarily storing some unsalable items will of course increase the inventory of the commercial sector, occupy a part of the funds, and thus increase some interest expenses and commodity losses. But from the overall perspective, it is necessary, reasonable, and permitted by the state. Now, the state has decided to allocate a sum of money specifically for the commercial sector to store commodities, which makes it easier for the commercial sector to actively support the Great Leap Forward in production.
    In short, the sluggish sales of some commodities (mainly consumer goods) is only a temporary phenomenon, because the basic situation in our country is not that there are too many things, and it is very likely that some commodities will still be insufficient after this autumn. We cannot only see that the current inventory is a bit large and not actively purchase goods, which is too short-sighted. The objective law is not only that the increase in consumption needs can stimulate the development of production, but also that the development of production will stimulate the increase in needs. Failure to see this will lead to mistakes in the future. Therefore, we say, there is no need to worry, it is a good thing to have more things.

    东西多了好得很
    万里浪
    生产战线上出现大跃进的形势以后，商业部门有的同志提出：“某些产品生产多了卖不掉怎么办”。这是当前我国经济生活中的一个新矛盾。广州市商业部门有些同志说：“跃进我双手拥护，困难是客观情况”。意思就是说，不管怎样讲，现实问题是有些产品生产增加而销路不旺（主要是城市人民所需的一些生活资料）。这种思想，目前在商业系统的职工中间有相当的代表性。
    我们应该怎样正确认识和解决这个问题呢？
    首先要看到，目前我们还是一个不富裕的国家，总的情况不是东西太多而是太少了。生产大跃进以后生产增加了，这是一件大好事情，正是我们奋力以求的。
    当然，生产增加以后，有些东西由于种种原因供求一时失调而滞销是可能的，怎么办呢？可以有两种解决办法。一种办法是为了求得供销的平衡，生产不要跃进，商业部门也就不用发愁有东西卖不出去了。显然用不着说明，谁也不会同意采用这种办法。
    再一种办法是，生产跃进以后，商业部门积极收购、大力推销，对于马上推销不出去的商品，就暂时储备起来。随着生产的发展，人民的生活水平将会逐渐提高，而我国的人这样多，需要大得很，因此不愁东西卖不出去。显然，这才是上策。
    工农业生产大跃进突破了旧的平衡，商业也必然要突破旧的平衡，否则，就不能与当前全面跃进的形势相适应，就会妨碍生产力的发展，影响工农业和其它事业的跃进。从实际情况来看，我们的国家这么大，人这么多，某些商品一时多了、少了，这种不平衡的现象是经常的。商品产销绝对的永远的平衡是不可能的，只能是由平衡到不平衡，然后再在新的基础上建立新的平衡。当前商业上的购销不平衡，实质上是生产与消费之间不平衡的客观反映。从消费方面来看，现在农村中，农民们正把钱集中用在发展生产（购买生产资料）方面，因而用在消费方面的钱就少了，这是好现象。在城市中，在勤俭持家的风气下，大家都来节约，这本来也是好现象。但是，有些人把正常消费和节约对立起来，连正当的必需消费品也不买了，或者是把买一件新衣、买一双新鞋，看成都是浪费。这是当前市场上消费品销路不旺的重要原因。这种认识当然是不全面的。该买的东西还是应该买的，这不能叫浪费。为了建设社会主义，我们提倡苦战，提倡节约一切不必要的开支投入到建设中去；但并不是要大家连正当的消费都不要了，更不是要降低人民的生活水平。因此经过适当的说明以后，市场的销售量是会增加的。克服这种不平衡的办法，从商业本身来说，第一是要想办法积极推销，切实起到调节的作用；第二是要及时地反映产销情况，由国家统筹安排，并和工业部门取得密切联系，使他们了解市场的需求，从正常的市场情况出发，从全面的观点出发，对于那些的确超过正常需求的产品加以适当的调整。
    把有些卖不掉的东西暂时储备起来，当然要增加商业部门的库存，占压一部分资金，并会因此增加一些利息支出和商品损耗。但从总的方面算大账，是需要的、合理的，也是国家允许的。现在，国家已经决定拨出一笔资金，专作商业部门储备商品之用，这就更便于商业部门积极支持生产的大跃进。
    总之，部分商品（主要是生活资料）的销路不旺，只是暂时的现象，因为我们国家当前的基本情况并不是东西过多，很有可能今年秋后，某些商品还嫌不足。我们不能只看到眼前库存大了些就不积极进货，那就看得太近了。客观的规律不仅是消费需要的增加能刺激生产的发展，而且生产的发展也会刺激需要的增加。不看到这一点，将来就会失策。因此我们说，不用发愁，东西多了好得很。
