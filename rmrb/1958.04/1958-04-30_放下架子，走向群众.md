Putting on performances in factories and rural areas by art troupes and delivering tickets to people's homes by cinemas and theaters are new phenomena emerging from the great leap forward in cultural and artistic endeavors, and they are good things that are heartily praised and welcomed by the broad masses.

What was the situation in the past? Performing groups such as song and dance troupes and drama troupes were happy to perform large-scale plays in grand theaters with magnificent stage settings, but they neglected audiences who were eagerly awaiting them in remote and poor areas. Although business units such as cinemas and theaters saw long queues in front of ticket offices and knew that many people could not see plays or movies because they did not have time to buy tickets, they did not actively seek solutions. But today, after the great leap forward wind has blown, after the fire of the "double-anti" campaign has blazed, these problems have been solved: the people in the mountainous areas have seen the mythological song and dance drama "Huaiyin Ji," and the tricycle workers have seen "Rickshaw Boy"; mobile ticket carts are on the streets, and audiences can buy movie and theater tickets without leaving their homes. This innovative improvement is precisely because cultural and artistic workers have seen the urgent need of the masses for cultural and spiritual food, and are willing to truly serve the people, putting down their airs and shedding their stale and pampered habits. This is a great leap forward in the thinking of cultural and artistic workers, and this spirit of creation and innovation is very valuable.

This practice of "going deep among the masses and facilitating workers and peasants" is not only greatly beneficial to the development of cultural and artistic popularization work, expanding the influence of socialist culture and art, and enriching the cultural lives of the people, but it is also of great benefit to cultural and artistic workers. It will strengthen the artistic practice of cultural and artistic workers, promote their contact and connection with the masses, and enable them to be tempered and improved, which will inevitably further promote the prosperity and flourishing of cultural and artistic undertakings directly or indirectly.

    放下架子，走向群众
    林碧
    艺术团体下厂下乡演出和影剧院送票上门的作法，是文化艺术事业在大跃进中出现的新气象，是广大群众衷心赞扬拍手欢迎的好事情。
    过去的情况怎样呢？歌舞团、话剧团等演出团体乐于在大剧场中演大戏，搞富丽堂皇的大布景，而对于穷乡僻壤引领渴望他们的观众却比较忽视。影剧院等营业单位虽然看到售票室前常常排着一字长蛇阵，也知道有不少人因为没有时间买票而不能看戏看电影，却没有积极想办法解决。但是今天，经过大跃进之风一吹，经过双反之火一烧，这些问题都获得解决了：山区群众看到了神话歌舞剧“槐荫记”，三轮车工人看到了“骆驼祥子”；流动售票小车上街了，观众足不出户便可以买到电影票、戏票了。这种富有革新精神的改进，正是由于文化艺术工作者看到了群众对于文化精神食粮的迫切需要，愿意真正为人民服务，放下架子，打掉了暮气、娇气以后做出来的成绩，这是文化艺术工作者思想上的大跃进，这种创造和革新精神是非常可贵的。
    这种“深入群众、便利工农”的作法，不仅大大有利于文化艺术普及工作的开展，扩大社会主义文化艺术的影响，丰富人民群众的文化生活，而对文化艺术工作者来说，也是大有好处的。它将加强文化艺术工作者的艺术实践，促进文化艺术工作者同群众的接触和联系，使他们从中受到锻炼和提高，而这些，又必然会直接或间接地进一步促使文化艺术事业的兴旺和繁荣。
