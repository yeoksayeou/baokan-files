	Composting Methods
	Under the guidance of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Sewerage and Environmental Sanitation, the Haidian District Agricultural Cooperative in Beijing began experimenting with composting urban waste with manure and horse manure in July 1957, with very good results.
	The specific method of "composting" is as follows: Use the organic waste from the city's garbage, i.e., remove the ash, etc., and leave the vegetable leaves, onion skins, vegetable roots, fruit peels, leaves, chicken feathers, meat scraps, intestines, dirty soil, etc., and mix them with horse manure and liquid manure to make compost. There are two ways to pile it up and the size of the piles: one is 30 meters long, 2 meters high, and 2.2 meters wide; the other is 25 meters long, 2 meters high, and 2.2 meters wide. Each pile has six layers: the first layer of garbage is mixed with a little horse manure, and then liquid manure is poured on top, and so on until the sixth layer. Each pile that is 30 meters long requires 240,000 jin of organic waste, 24,600 jin of liquid manure, and more than 290 jin of horse manure. After the six layers are piled up, they are plastered with mud, leaving ventilation holes. The temperature inside the pile rises from 40 degrees Celsius to 70 degrees Celsius, and then slowly cools down. It takes about 50 days to be usable. The insect eggs contained in these organic wastes are killed at such high temperatures, which is also beneficial for sanitation work.
	The Benefits of Composting
	Vigorously promoting the method of "composting" is an effective measure to solve the fertilizer problem in the suburbs. Composting has many benefits.
	In the past, suburban farmers were accustomed to using dried manure, but when liquid manure is dried, a large amount of fertilizer effectiveness is lost. If composting is used instead, the fertilizer effectiveness of liquid manure can be fully preserved, and the losses caused by wind, sun, and rain during the drying of manure can also be reduced. For example, in 1956, the six production teams of the Fuqiang Agricultural Cooperative were allocated liquid manure according to the number of vegetable plots. The sixth production team mixed the liquid manure with garbage, vegetable seedlings, and dirty soil to solve the fertilizer problem for the whole year. The other teams dried the liquid manure on the ground, and the dried manure produced was not even enough for the base fertilizer for the previous crop. If the method of mixing liquid manure with garbage used by the sixth production team is changed to composting, the effect will be even greater.
	Implementing this method can reduce vegetable costs and reduce expenses. For example, according to the piling method of 30 meters long per pile mentioned above, each pile can produce about 190,000 to 200,000 jin of compost. Including labor, the cost per pile is about 163 yuan, which is 8 cents per 100 jin; if labor is not included, the cost per pile is 95 yuan, which is 4 cents and 7 li per 100 jin. According to the experience of the masses and the results of the tests, the ratio of nitrogen fertilizer contained in compost to dried manure is roughly: five jin of compost is equivalent to one jin of dried manure, but five jin of compost plus labor only costs 4 li, while one jin of dried manure costs 2 cents and 1 li. Generally, 2,000 jin of dried manure are used as base fertilizer per mu of vegetable field, which costs 42 yuan, while 10,000 jin of compost only costs 8 yuan.
	Composting can also solve the contradiction between the supply of liquid manure and the production season. The supply of urban liquid manure is limited to that amount every day. However, agricultural production is seasonal, and a large amount of liquid manure is needed during the production season. When it is not needed, the liquid manure is simply poured into pits and stored, which results in great losses during the rainy season in summer. However, if composting is used, it can be stored at any time, solving the contradiction in supply.
	In previous years, because agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs dried manure everywhere, there were manure yards everywhere, which affected the sanitation of nearby government offices, factories, and schools. After using the composting method, this situation can be basically avoided.
	According to experienced farmers, in addition to urban organic waste that can be used to mix with liquid manure for composting, vegetable leaves, bean stalks, pea stalks, tomato stalks, zucchini stalks, as well as weeds, leaves, garbage, and dirty soil from the sides of the fields, roads, and mountains in the countryside and from the homes of cooperative members can all be used for composting.
	Of course, in promoting this method, there are still some problems that need to be solved, and the technology should be further researched. For example, what other things can be used? Can it be used in paddy fields and greenhouses? These still need further experiments.

    利用城市有机垃圾造堆肥

            堆肥的方法
    北京市海淀区农业社在北京市上下水道工程局环境卫生处的指导下，从1957年7月开始试用城市垃圾和粪稀、马粪堆肥的办法，效果很好。
    “堆肥”积肥的具体作法是：用城内垃圾中的有机垃圾，即把炉灰等除去，留下的菜叶、葱皮、菜根、果皮、树叶、鸡毛、肉皮、肠子、脏土等，与马粪、粪稀等混合一起堆肥。堆的办法和堆的大小有二种：一种是每堆长三十公尺、高二公尺、宽二点二公尺；另一种是每堆长二十五公尺、高二公尺、宽二点二公尺。每堆有六层：第一层垃圾上边加一点马粪，上边倒粪稀，直到第六层都是用这个办法。三十公尺长的每堆共需有机垃圾二十四万斤、粪稀二万四千六百斤、马粪二百九十余斤。六层堆好后，用泥抹好，留上通风孔，堆内温度从摄氏四十度一直上升到七十度，然后慢慢冷下来，约需五十天左右即可用了。这些有机垃圾中所含的虫卵在这样高的温度下，都烧死了，所以对于卫生工作也有利。
              堆肥的好处
    大力推广“堆肥”的办法是解决郊区肥料问题的有效措施。堆肥的好处很多。
    过去郊区农民习惯用粪干，而当粪稀在晒晾粪干时，会损失大量肥效。如改用堆肥办法后，粪稀的肥效可以全部保存，而且还可以减少晒晾粪干时风吹、日晒、雨淋的损失。如1956年富强农业社六个生产队，社里都按菜地数拨给粪稀，其中第六生产队是将粪稀与垃圾、菜秧、秽土等拌用，解决了全年的肥料问题。而其他几个队都是把粪稀倒在地上晾粪干，结果所出的粪干用作前茬的底肥还不够。如果将第六生产队的粪稀拌垃圾的办法变为堆肥的办法，效果就会更大。
    实行这个办法，可以降低蔬菜成本、减少开支。如按上边所说的每堆长三十公尺的堆法，堆成后每堆可出堆肥约十九万到二十万斤。加上人工，每堆成本约合一百六十三元，每百斤是八分钱；如不加人工，每堆成本是九十五元，每百斤合四分七厘钱。根据群众的经验和化验的结果，堆肥所含氮肥与粪干的比例大体是：五斤堆肥抵一斤粪干，但五斤堆肥加上人工才合四厘钱，而粪干一斤就要二分一厘钱。每亩菜田底肥一般用粪干二千斤，合四十二元，而用一万斤堆肥才合八元钱。
    堆肥还可以解决粪稀供应与生产季节的矛盾。城市粪稀的供应，每天就是那么多。但农业生产是季节性的，生产的季节大量需要粪稀；不需要时，送来了粪稀，只好暂时倒在坑里存起来，在夏天时遇上雨涝天，损失很大。但如采用堆肥的方法，什么时候都可以储存，解决了供应上的矛盾。
    往年因为郊区农业社到处晾粪干，到处是粪场，影响附近机关、工厂、学校的卫生。改用堆肥办法后，基本上可以避免这种情况。
    据有经验的农民谈，除去城市有机垃圾可以用来拌粪稀堆肥外，农村中地里边的菜叶、扁豆秧、豌豆秧、西红柿秧、西葫芦秧以及地边道旁和山上的杂草、树叶和社员家中的垃圾、脏土全可以用来堆肥。
    当然在推广这个办法中，还有一些问题需要解决，技术上也应进一步研究。比如到底还有哪些东西可以利用？在稻田及阳畦中是否可以用？这些还需要进一步试验。
