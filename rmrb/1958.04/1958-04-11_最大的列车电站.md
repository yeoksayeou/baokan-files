The largest train power station in China is being installed in Harbin. The first set of power generation equipment officially began generating electricity on the 7th.

This train power station is divided into four units, consisting of forty-eight carriages. After all four sets of equipment are generating electricity, the power generation capacity will be 13,000 kilowatts, equivalent to the power generation capacity of a medium-sized thermal power plant. The complete set of equipment for the train power station is supplied by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia.

    最大的列车电站
    我国规模最大的列车发电站正在哈尔滨市安装，第一组发电设备已在7日正式发电。
    这座列车发电站共分四个机组，由四十八节车厢组成。四组设备全部发电后，发电能力为一万三千瓩，相当于一个中型火力发电厂的发电能力。列车电站的全套设备是由苏联和捷克斯洛伐克供给的。
