Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 10th (TASS dispatch): The magazine "New Times" published the interview given by Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to a special correspondent of the magazine. In response to the reporter's question about the prospects for peaceful reunification of Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh expressed his firm belief that such reunification is possible.

In response to a reporter's question about his assessment of the current international situation, particularly the situation in Southeast Asia, President Ho Chi Minh said that, in his view, the current international situation is improving, and the Soviet Union's and the socialist camp's peace-loving policies are gaining increasingly broad support. When discussing the situation in Southeast Asia, President Ho Chi Minh said that the tense situation in the region is also easing. Referring to the foreign-engineered conspiracies in Indonesia, President Ho Chi Minh expressed his belief that the Indonesian people will surely achieve victory.

Finally, President Ho Chi Minh spoke about the three-year national economic plan being formulated by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
