    The Japanese People Do Not Want Nuclear Weapons

    The Fury of Niijima
    South of Tokyo, 157 kilometers from the coast, in the center of the Izu Seven Islands, lies a small island called Niijima, with a circumference of only 28 kilometers (extending several times further south are the Ogasawara Islands, occupied by the U.S. military and now a military base). This evergreen island, home to only 600 poor fishing families, has now become one of the focal points of Japan's struggle against nuclear weapons.

    The Japanese Defense Agency has taken a fancy to this small island and plans to build a missile base here. To win the consent of the island's residents, the Defense Agency promised to build them a beautiful port, as well as roads and an airport.

    Following the instructions of the U.S. military, the Defense Agency is now actively equipping the Japanese Self-Defense Forces with missiles. At the fourth Japan-U.S. Security Committee meeting, the Japanese government decided to accept the U.S. "Sidewinder" air-to-air missile. The trial production of Japanese-made missiles is also being stepped up. After searching and surveying missile test sites across the country, the Defense Agency finally concluded that Niijima was the most suitable location. To expedite the construction of a missile base here, a budget of 100 million yen has been allocated, and the first missile is scheduled to be launched in August this year.

    When news of the Defense Agency's plan to build a missile base on Niijima was published in the newspapers last October, elementary school teachers on Niijima were the first to oppose it. The Tokyo Regional Council of Trade Unions (Tokyo Chi-hyo) appealed to various democratic groups and sent support teams to Niijima, dispatching the first group in December and the second and third groups in January this year. After arriving on Niijima, the support teams held symposiums and lectures with the island's residents and engaged in sincere discussions. The elderly, housewives, and young people on the island all voiced their angry protests from the bottom of their hearts.

    On February 5th, a large-scale meeting, unprecedented on the island, was held in the auditorium of Niijima Elementary School, with over 1,400 people participating. The "Niijima Alliance Against the Establishment of a Missile Test Site" was formed, issuing a declaration stating: "The establishment of a missile test site is not just a problem for Niijima, but a problem for all of Japan. We will closely unite with the people of the whole country and strive to oppose the establishment of a missile test site." Subsequently, peace and democratic groups such as the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs and the Tokyo Chi-hyo also established a support group council in Tokyo. On March 1st, at the "Asia-Africa Joint Action Day" rally held in Tokyo to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Bikini victims and oppose the U.S. testing of hydrogen bombs on Eniwetok Island, representatives from the Niijima Alliance Against the Establishment of a Missile Test Site also attended, and the meeting unanimously passed a resolution that the people of the whole country would fight against turning Niijima into a missile base.

    The Defense Agency has not given up and will continue to carry out a series of appeasement and divisive activities on Niijima in the future; but the residents of Niijima will undoubtedly continue to fight, just like the farmers of Sunagawa who persevered in their struggle for three years.
              "Return Our Land!"
    According to statistics from the Japanese government, the number of U.S. military airfields in Japan was 39 in 1952 and had decreased to 29 by 1958; the number of military training grounds was 63 in 1952 and had decreased to 48 by 1958. In addition, there are still 100,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan, and the ground forces have decreased to a quarter of what they were in 1952.

    The Japanese people do not see this as something to be happy about, nor do they naively believe that this is a victory in the struggle to "get the American bastards to go home." People increasingly clearly see that the Japan-U.S. Security Committee established after Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States last year is actually an institution that drags Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system. With the withdrawal of U.S. ground forces stationed in Japan, the first and second meetings of the Japan-U.S. Security Committee decided on plans for the priority deployment and increase of 10,000 personnel for the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. This is, of course, a supreme order from the United States. Moreover, the 10th Mixed Regiment, which the Ground Self-Defense Force is preparing to establish under this plan to increase personnel by 10,000, is to be organized as an atomic unit. Based on this model, by the time the "Defense Plan" is completed at the end of 1960, the existing 7th, 8th, and 9th Mixed Regiments will also be completely reorganized into atomic units.

    On the one hand, the United States uses Japan's "defense capabilities" to replace its ground forces, and on the other hand, it is still frantically building and expanding important strongholds for atomic strategy. In Okinawa, the United States suppresses local people's resistance while forcibly occupying large tracts of land to expand the Nike missile base. In various parts of Japan, the United States returns airfields and military training grounds to Japan or turns them into a form of "joint use" with the Self-Defense Forces, making a gesture as if respecting Japanese sovereignty, but on the other hand, it puts the Self-Defense Forces themselves under the command of the U.S. atomic strategy, and has not relaxed its expansion work on several important bases such as Tachikawa (Sunagawa), Yokota, Kisarazu, Komaki, Niigata, and Itazuke.

    The Japanese people will not be deceived by this "new wine in old bottles" trick. The military training ground at the foot of Mount Fuji, which was previously "jointly used," is now used solely by the Self-Defense Forces after the U.S. military withdrew last year, and continues to conduct live-fire exercises. The 3,150 farmers united in the Higashi Fuji Iriai Kumiai (Eastern Fuji Common Land Association) have put forward demands such as "Return our land" and "Oppose the continued use by the Self-Defense Forces," and have sent a petition delegation to the Japanese government. At the Komaki base in Aichi Prefecture, although the U.S. Air Force began to withdraw in September last year, expansion work is still continuing, and the Aichi Prefecture conference of the "Asia-Africa Joint Action Day" on March 1st also made a resolution opposing the relocation of the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force to this base and continuing to use it. The Soumagahara military training ground, which is famous for the Girard incident, will also be returned to Japan soon, and local farmers are brewing plans to take back the land and cultivate it again. In addition, struggles to demand the return of land to farmers have also been launched at bases in Niigata, Hyakurigahara, Kumagaya in Saitama Prefecture, and Miho in Shimane Prefecture.
      Making Japan a Nuclear-Free Zone
    The Japanese Self-Defense Forces are secretly conducting atomic equipment and training under the guidance of the U.S. military advisory group. The U.S. garrison at Iwakuni base has transported "Skyhawk" bombers capable of carrying atomic bombs into Japan. Missiles such as "Sidewinder" and "Honest John" have also been openly transported into Japan or are preparing to be transported into Japan. How can the Japanese people tolerate their territory becoming a missile base, with U.S. planes carrying atomic bombs constantly circling over Japan?

    On March 15th, the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement calling on the people of the whole country to launch a movement to make Japan a nuclear-free zone.

    On March 26th, the Special Committee Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs of the Japanese Socialist Party decided to launch a broad national movement to oppose the transport of nuclear weapons and missiles into Japan.

    The Japanese people's movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs, centered on the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, is now forming a new high tide due to protests against the U.S. testing of hydrogen bombs on Eniwetok Island.

    The Soviet Union's decision to take the lead in stopping nuclear weapons testing has aroused warm cheers from the Japanese people. The Japanese people have also been greatly encouraged by this, and they will strengthen their unity and struggle to make Japan a nuclear-free zone and make a greater contribution to world peace.

    日本人民不要核武器
    蓝海
    新岛的怒火
    东京南面，距海岸一百五十七公里、在伊豆七岛的中心，有一个叫做新岛的周围仅有二十八公里的小岛（往南再伸延几倍距离，就是被美军霸占的现已成为军事基地的小笠原群岛）。这个仅住有六百户穷苦渔民的常绿之岛，现在已成为日本反对核武器斗争的焦点之一。
    日本防卫厅看中了这个小岛，准备在这里建设导弹基地。为了争取岛上居民的同意，防卫厅答应给他们修建一个漂亮的港口，还答应修筑道路和机场。
    防卫厅遵从美军的指示，现正有重点地积极为日本自卫队配备导弹。在第四次日美安全委员会上，日本政府已决定接受美国的“响尾蛇”式空空导弹。日本国产导弹的试制工作，也在加紧进行。防卫厅在全国物色和测量导弹试射场的结果，最后认为新岛是最合适的地点。为了加紧在这里建设导弹基地，已作了一亿日元的预算，并预定在今年8月发射第一颗导弹。
    去年10月，防卫厅准备在新岛建设导弹基地的消息从报纸传出以后，新岛的小学教师首先起来反对。东京地方工会评议会（简称东京地评），向各民主团体发出呼吁，向新岛派出了声援队，12月送走了第一批，今年1月又相继送走了第二批、第三批。声援队到了新岛以后，同岛上居民举行座谈会、讲演会，进行了恳切的交谈。岛上的老年人、家庭主妇和青年们，都从心里发出了愤怒的抗议。
    2月5日，在新岛小学校礼堂，召开了一个有一千四百多人参加的、在岛上说来是空前规模的大会，成立了“新岛反对建立导弹试射场同盟”，发表宣言说：“建立导弹试射场不是新岛一地的问题，而是日本全国的问题。我们将同全国人民密切团结，为反对建立导弹试射场而努力。”接着，日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会、东京地评等和平、民主团体，也在东京成立了支援团体协议会。3月1日，在东京举行的为纪念比基尼被害四周年、反对美国在恩纳威托克岛试验氢弹的“亚非共同行动日”大会，新岛反对建立导弹试射场同盟也派来了代表，会上一致通过了全国人民将为反对把新岛变成导弹基地而斗争的决议。
    防卫厅还没有死心，今后还会对新岛进行一系列的怀柔和分化活动；但新岛居民，无疑地也会像坚持了三年斗争的砂川农民一样，继续斗争下去。
              “还我土地！”
    据日本政府的统计，在日美军机场，1952年有三十九处，1958年已减少到二十九处；军事演习场1952年有六十三处，1958年已减少到四十八处。此外，驻日美军现在还有十万人，地面部队已减少到1952年的四分之一。
    日本人民并没有把这看成是值得高兴的事，也没有天真地以为这就是“美国佬滚回去”的斗争的胜利。人们日益明显地看到，去年岸信介访美之后设立的日美安全委员会，实际上是一个把日本拖进美国原子战略体制的机关。随着驻日美军地面部队的撤退，日美安全委员会的第一次、第二次会议决定了日本自卫队的重点配置和增员一万名的计划。这当然是来自美国的至上命令。而且，陆上自卫队根据这增员一万名计划准备新成立的第十混成团，是要作为原子部队编成的。以它为蓝本，到1960年末“防卫计划”完成的时候，现有的第七、八、九混成团也将全部改编为原子部队。
    美国一方面用日本的“防卫力量”来代替它的地面部队，一方面仍在疯狂地建设和扩充原子战略的重要据点。在冲绳，美国一面镇压当地人民的反抗，一面强占大片土地，扩建奈克导弹基地。在日本各地，美国把机场和军事演习场交还日本或变成和自卫队“共同使用”的形式，作出一种仿佛尊重日本主权的姿态，但另一面，却使自卫队本身处于美国原子战略的指挥之下，而且对立川（砂川）、横田、木更津、小牧、新澙、板付等几处重要基地，也仍然没有放松扩建工作。
    日本人民是不会受这种“换汤不换药”的障眼法的欺骗的。富士山麓以前“共同使用”的军事演习场，在去年美军撤走以后，现在则由自卫队单独使用，仍不断进行实弹射击的演习。团结在东富士入合组合的三千一百五十名农民，提出“还我土地”“反对自卫队继续使用”等要求，已向日本政府派出了请愿团。在爱知县的小牧基地，美国空军部队虽从去年9月即已开始撤退，但扩建工作仍在继续，3月1日“亚非共同行动日”爱知县大会也作出了决议，反对日本航空自卫队移驻到这里，继续使用这个基地。由于哲腊德事件而闻名的相马原军事演习场，也将在最近交还日本，当地农民正在酝酿要回土地，重新耕作。此外，新澙、百里原、埼玉县的熊谷、岛根县的美保等基地，也都展开了要求把土地还给农民的斗争。
      使日本成为无核武器区
    日本自卫队正在美国军事顾问团的指导下，秘密进行原子装备和训练。岩国基地的美国驻军已把能够携带原子弹的“空中之鹰”式轰炸机运进了日本。“响尾蛇”“诚实的约翰”等导弹也公开地运进了日本，或准备运进日本。日本人民怎么能容忍自己的国土沦为导弹基地、携带原子弹的美国飞机不断地在日本上空盘旋呢？
    3月15日日本共产党发表声明，号召全国人民展开运动，使日本成为无核武器区。
    3月26日日本社会党禁止原子弹氢弹特别委员会决定展开广泛的国民运动，反对把核武器、导弹运进日本。
    以日本禁止原子弹氢弹协议会为中心的日本人民的反对原子弹氢弹的运动，现在由于抗议美国在恩纳威托克岛试验氢弹，又在形成一个高潮。
    苏联决定率先停止试验核武器，引起了日本人民的热烈欢呼。日本人民从这里也得到了极大鼓舞，他们将加强团结和斗争，争取使日本成为无核武器区，为世界和平作出更大的贡献。
