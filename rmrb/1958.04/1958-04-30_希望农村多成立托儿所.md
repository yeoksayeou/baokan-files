    Hoping for More Nurseries to be Established in Rural Areas
    In the current era of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture in our country, fully mobilizing the vast number of rural women to participate in various labor activities and rationally organizing the labor force has a positive role in promoting increased grain production and achieving the agricultural leap forward plan. However, in actual life, some women have not yet participated in labor. This is not because they are unwilling to work, but because they have the burden of children. For example, some women want to go to the fields to work, but because their children are small and there is no one at home to take care of them, they cannot do so as they wish. In addition, some women have older children of seven or eight years old, and in order to go to the fields for production, they have to entrust the younger children to the older children to look after; in this way, older children of school age cannot attend school, which also creates contradictions.
    In order to fully and comprehensively mobilize rural women to participate in labor, create value, and gradually improve their living standards, I suggest that relevant departments and agricultural cooperatives in various regions, based on the specific circumstances of their localities, gradually establish some simple and suitable nurseries to meet the actual needs of those working women.

    希望农村多成立托儿所
    在目前我国农业大跃进的时代里，如何充分发动广大农村妇女参加各项劳动，并合理地把劳动力组织起来，这对于提高粮食产量、实现农业跃进计划有积极的促进作用。但是，在实际生活当中，有些妇女还没有参加劳动，这不是她们不愿意劳动，而是有孩子的负担。如有些妇女虽想下地干活，但孩子小，家中没人照顾而不能如愿；另外，有些妇女因家里有七、八岁的大孩子，自己为了下地生产，不得不把小孩子托给大孩子看管；这样，适龄上学的大孩子不能上学，同样产生矛盾。
    为了充分地、全面地动员农村妇女参加劳动，创造价值，并逐步改善她们的生活水平，我建议各地有关部门和农业社，根据本地具体情况，逐步举办一些简易的、并且适合需要的托儿所，以满足那些劳动妇女的实际需要。
