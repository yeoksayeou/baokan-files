    Grasp Ideology, Grasp Measures, Guide the High Tide Forward
    CCP Heilongjiang Provincial Committee Expanded Meeting Combines Abstract and Practical Discussions
    Deeply Analyzing Ideology and the Situation to Boost Enthusiasm and Promote the Great Leap Forward

    (By our reporter Cheng Xiaohou) The magnificent socialist construction high tide in Heilongjiang Province is leaping forward at an astonishing pace, with new changes taking place in both urban and rural areas, as well as in people's ideological outlook. At this crucial juncture, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an expanded plenary session from April 7th to 18th. Based on the recent instructions from the central government, the meeting deeply analyzed the current unprecedented high tide situation. It was decided that the entire province should adhere to the spirit of "two reliances, two focuses, and two comprehensives," namely, relying on the leadership of the Party, relying on the infinite wisdom and strength of the masses, having a central focus and backbone, and engaging in comprehensive planning and comprehensive leaps forward. This will further propel the high tide of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results throughout the province.
    This meeting consistently implemented the spirit of combining "abstract matters" (ideology and theory) and "practical matters" (actual work) from beginning to end. It studied and applied the weapon of dialectical materialism to specifically analyze the situation, analyze practical problems, and analyze ideology, resulting in significant improvements in everyone's ideological understanding. This will enable them to better stand at the forefront of the high tide and guide its healthier and more in-depth development.
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Party organization has gained an important experience in leading this high tide: the Party's leadership must be adept at grasping objective development trends and newly emerging elements among the masses, and promptly point out the direction of development. When this is combined with the actions of the masses, it will generate tremendous power. In February, the Provincial Party Committee proposed the goal of basically achieving agricultural mechanization in five years. In just over two months, many small, outdated factories that were previously overlooked have created various types of tractors through the efforts of their workers. In rural areas, the experience of "collective ownership and management" proposed by the Baiquan County agricultural cooperative, where they purchased their own tractors, has been disseminated. Agricultural cooperatives throughout the region have pooled large amounts of funds to buy tractors, enabling our previously "poor and blank" rural areas to achieve agricultural mechanization more quickly by relying on the strength of the masses. Local industries throughout the region are also flourishing like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. These many facts have quickly shattered the old, mystified views of "agricultural mechanization" and "industrialization."
    In industry, after the Party proposed the Great Leap Forward, advanced figures like Su Guangming, who continuously innovates technologically to complete the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and advanced units like the Ma Hengchang group, who are ahead of schedule and are undertaking the production tasks of 1967, have emerged. The technological revolution has begun to become the action of the broad masses. In particular, the newly emerged experience of Qinghua Tool Factory cadres participating in production to lead production, and workers directly participating in grassroots production management and reforming business rules and regulations, during the in-depth development of the rectification campaign and the "anti-three evils" and "anti-five evils" movements, is a great innovation in the management of socialist enterprises. This experience has already blossomed throughout the province. The increase in workers' productivity in many factories is no longer a few percentage points, but tens of percentage points.
    The meeting believes that the current high tide situation will inevitably lead to continuous new changes in all aspects of urban and rural areas. For example, changing agricultural production from manual operation to machine operation is another great revolution, namely the technological revolution, following the land reform of a democratic revolution nature and the cooperative movement of a socialist revolution nature. History proves that changes in tools will cause changes in social productive forces, culture, and even people's ideology, and will affect the development of various aspects of work. Another example is the innovative creation of Qinghua Tool Factory cadres participating in production to lead production, and workers directly participating in management and reforming business rules and regulations, which further adjusts the relations of production in socialist enterprises, and will similarly bring profound impact to various aspects of work in enterprises. Therefore, the Party's leadership must stand at the forefront of this high tide, enthusiastically guide and support all advanced things, so that the movement can "consolidate, improve, develop in depth," and move forward more healthily and steadily.
    The meeting arranged the work of the entire province in accordance with the requirements of "two reliances, two focuses, and two comprehensives," and decided to put ideological work in the first place. Taking politics as the commander, it will promote the leap forward of agriculture, industry, forestry and other tasks.
    The meeting believes that leadership in the high tide must also emphasize four grasps, namely, grasping political ideology, grasping organizational leadership, grasping specific measures, and grasping advanced experience and weak links, so that the wisdom and strength of the masses can be more fully brought into play.

    抓思想抓措施引导高潮前进
    中共黑龙江省委扩大会议务虚和务实并举
    深入分析思想和形势鼓足干劲推动大跃进
    本报讯　记者程晓候报道：黑龙江省波澜壮阔的社会主义建设高潮，正以一日千里之势向前飞跃发展，城市和农村以及人们的思想面貌都在发生新的变化。中共黑龙江省委在这个重要的关键时期，于4月7日到18日召开了省委全体会议（扩大），根据中央最近指示精神，深刻地分析了当前这种历史上前所未有的高潮形势，决定全省上下按照“两依、两有、两全”的精神，即依靠党的领导、依靠群众无穷无尽的智慧和力量，有中心、有骨干，全面规划、全面跃进的精神，把全省这种鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的高潮更推向前进。
    这个会议从始到终贯彻了“虚业”（思想理论）和“实业”（实际工作）并举的精神，学习运用唯物辩证法的武器，具体分析形势，分析实际问题，分析思想，使大家思想认识有很大提高。这样就能够更好地站在高潮前面，引导高潮更健康更深入地发展。
    从黑龙江省党的组织在领导这次高潮中得到了一个重要体会，就是党的领导必须善于掌握客观发展趋势和群众中涌现出来的新的萌芽形态的东西，及时地指出发展方向，这样和群众的行动结合起来就会产生伟大的力量。在2月份，省委一提出争取五年基本上实现农业机械化的号召，到现在只有两个多月时间，可是过去许多不被人们注意的设备陈旧的小厂，经过职工群众的努力，已经创造出了各种各样拖拉机。在农村，把拜泉县农业社提出的自己买拖拉机的“社有社营”经验传播开来，各地农业社已经集中大批资金买拖拉机，使我们原来“一穷二白”的农村，能够更快地依靠群众力量实现农业机械化。各地的地方工业也像雨后春笋一样遍地开花得到发展。这许多事实很快就打破了过去那些对“农业机械化”“工业化”的神秘化的陈旧观点。
    在工业上，党提出大跃进之后，出现了苏广铭这样不断进行技术革新提前完成第二个五年计划的先进人物，以及马恒昌小组这样走在时间前面，正在进行着1967年生产任务的先进单位。技术革命已经开始成为广大群众的行动。特别是在整风双反运动深入开展中，新出现的庆华工具厂干部参加生产领导生产，工人直接参加基层生产管理和改革业务规章制度的经验，是社会主义企业管理上一个伟大的创举。这个经验已经在全省开花。许多工厂工人生产效率的提高，已经不是平时的百分之几，而是百分之几十。
    会议认为目前这种高潮形势必将使城市和农村各方面不断发生新的变化。像农业生产由手工操作改变为机器操作，这是继民主革命性质的土地改革、社会主义革命性质的合作化运动之后，又一次伟大的革命，即技术革命。历史证明，工具的改变，就会引起社会生产力、文化以至人们思想各方面的变化，会牵动各个方面的工作的发展。又如庆华工具厂干部参加生产领导生产，工人直接参加管理和改革业务规章制度的创举，使社会主义企业的生产关系进一步得到调整，同样会给企业里各个方面的工作带来深刻的影响。因此，党的领导必须站在这个高潮前面，满腔热忱引导和支持一切先进的事物，使运动“巩固提高，深入发展”，更健康地踏实地前进。
    会议对全省工作的安排，按照“两依，两有，两全”的要求，决定把思想工作放在第一位。以政治为统帅，推动农业、工业、林业及其他各项工作向前跃进。
    会议认为，在高潮中领导还必须强调四抓，即抓政治思想，抓组织领导，抓具体措施，抓先进经验和薄弱环节，使群众的智慧和力量更充分地得到发挥。
