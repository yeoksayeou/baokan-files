    Is Heart-to-Heart Talk Difficult?
    Yi Qing
    There was a leading cadre who sincerely wanted to have heart-to-heart talks with some cadres. Once, he actually found a cadre and asked him to talk about his "inner thoughts," but he himself didn't talk about any of his own. After two or three such talks, nothing of substance emerged. This leading cadre then exclaimed with deep emotion, "Heart-to-heart talks are really difficult!"
    Heart-to-heart talks are both easy and not easy.
    Easy, because as long as you are sincere and open-hearted, your heart will be revealed. The first time you might only talk about three-tenths, but the second and third times you can talk about five-tenths, eight-tenths, or even ten-tenths. Each time you talk more, each time you talk deeper, truly achieving "hearts linked together." For example, when a dean of the Coal Mine Design Institute of the Ministry of Coal Industry had a heart-to-heart talk with an engineer, he talked about his thoughts, work, and even his family life in a sincere and meaningful way. The engineer was deeply moved and brought up opinions that he had been afraid to mention for many years. Obviously, the dean gave his heart to the engineer, and the engineer also gave his heart to the dean.
    If you are not sincere and open-hearted, only asking others to talk while you don't, then "if the pot isn't hot, the pancake won't stick." How can people know if your heart is cold or warm? They won't be willing to open their hearts to you. The result of such a talk is "few words are agreeable when the spirits are not in harmony." The more you talk, the more tasteless it becomes, and both sides don't want to continue. Or you talk about everything under the sun, rambling on and on, saying a lot but with empty content.
    Not easy, because to be sincere and open-hearted, leading cadres must appear as ordinary workers, exchanging thoughts and opinions with cadres, and adopting the attitude that if you have problems, I will help you solve them, and if I have problems, you will help me solve them. In this way, the cadres below will feel that you are "as close as a confidant," with no barriers, and they will talk about their "hearts." If you still appear as a leader, you won't be able to talk openly. The other party feels that you are a leader and is unwilling to casually reveal their innermost thoughts. You also feel that you are a leader and shouldn't lose your leader's demeanor during the conversation. So, the conversation between the two people is like discussing issues at a meeting or assigning tasks to cadres, which is dull and uninteresting. This kind of talk can only be called talking "words," not talking "hearts," and it won't reveal "hearts."
    As long as you let go of your airs, heart-to-heart talks are not difficult!

    谈心难不难？
    怡清
    有这样一位领导干部，衷心想找几个干部谈谈心。一次，他果然找到一个干部，要这个干部谈谈自己的“心事”，但他自己却是什么“心”也没有谈，这样，谈了二、三次以后，没有谈出什么心来，这位领导干部便感慨万分地说：“谈心这件事真难呀！”
    谈心这件事也容易也不容易。
    说容易，是因为只要推心置腹，赤诚相见，心也就谈出来了，头一次虽然还只能谈三分，可是第二次第三次就可以谈五分、八分、十分，一次比一次谈得多，一次比一次谈得深，真正做到了“心心相印”。举一个例子：煤炭工业部煤矿设计院有一位院长在和一位工程师谈心时，把自己的思想、工作乃至家庭生活等等方面的情况都谈了，言辞恳切，意味深长，这位工程师受到很大感动，把自己多少年来不敢提的意见提出来了。显然，这位院长把心交给了工程师，工程师也把心交给了院长。
    如果不是推心置腹，赤诚相见，只是要人家谈心，自己不谈，那么，“锅不热，饼不贴”，人家摸不着你的心是冷还是热？也就不愿把心掏出来交给你。这样的谈心，其结果是“话不投机半句多”，越谈越觉得没有味道，双方都不想谈下去，或者海阔天空，东拉西扯，话倒说了不少，可是空空洞洞没有内容。
    说不容易，是因为要做到推心置腹，赤诚相见，领导干部一定要以普通劳动者的姿态出现，和干部互相谈思想，提意见，采取你有问题我帮助你解决，我有问题你帮助我解决的态度，这样，下面干部感到你“亲如知己”，无所隔阂，也就会谈出“心”来。如果还是以领导者的身份出现，那就谈不起来，对方感到你是领导者，不愿随随便便谈出自己的心里话，而自己也感到自己是领导者，谈话时不要失去领导者的风度。于是两个人谈话，就像在会议上讨论问题，或者是要干部来接受任务，索然无味。这种谈话，只能说是谈“话”，不是谈“心”，也谈不出“心”来。
    只要放下架子，谈心是不难的！
