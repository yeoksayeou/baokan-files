Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 6th: Approximately 70% of the research personnel at the East China Agricultural Science Institute have gone to the countryside. Among them, forty-one researchers departed in late March for Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces. Together with local scientific and technical personnel, they formed working groups focusing on areas such as Huaibei, double-cropping of rice and wheat, and Huangyan tangerines. They are conducting agricultural scientific research purposefully in conjunction with local production. Furthermore, eight departments within the institute dispatched forty-five researchers to participate in the Jiangsu Province Agricultural Science and Technology Guidance Network, collaborating with personnel from fifteen other agricultural-related universities and scientific institutions. They have already established agricultural science and technology guidance stations and comprehensive working groups in key counties in areas such as Taihu Lake, the mountainous areas of Zhenjiang, Lixiahe, and Xuzhou-Huaiyin, launching large-scale experimental research activities.

The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the work of these researchers. The Provincial Party Secretary and relevant prefectural party secretaries are concurrently serving as the heads of the general station and branch stations of the Agricultural Science and Technology Guidance Network. Their research work is being uniformly planned and led by Party committees at all levels.
