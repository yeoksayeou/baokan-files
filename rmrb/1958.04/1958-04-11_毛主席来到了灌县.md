The ancient Dujiangyan's water plays a welcoming melody, and the western Sichuan plain is full of spring. One afternoon in March, a tall man in a gray uniform—our beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong—appeared on the Cheng'a Highway near Guanxian.

Chairman Mao walked to the side of the highway. This was a high mountain on the left bank of the Min River. After the Cheng'a Highway wound around to the mountainside, it stretched westward. Standing here, one could see the surging Min River at the foot of the mountain. Chairman Mao took out his binoculars and carefully inspected the Dujiangyan project, which has a history of more than 2,200 years, and inquired about the fish mouth, inner river, outer river, and "macha" engineering conditions.

While inspecting the Dujiangyan project, Chairman Mao listened to Li Jingquan, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and Zhang Jianzhong, Director of the Dujiangyan Management Office, describe the annual maintenance.

Chairman Mao asked with concern: "Do you give the migrant workers money for the annual maintenance?"

Comrade Li Jingquan replied: "Yes, we do."

Chairman Mao asked again: "How many workers does it take to repair it once?"

Zhang Jianzhong said: "It takes about one million migrant workers."

Chairman Mao said: "In the future, we should use machines to repair it, using winches and excavators, which will save manpower." Chairman Mao pointed to the Dujiang Fish Mouth under the cable bridge and said to Zhang Jianzhong: "In the future, we must find ways to use modern engineering to control the sediment!"

After hearing Chairman Mao's words, everyone couldn't help but think of what Chairman Mao said as early as 1934, "Water conservancy is the lifeblood of agriculture," and it also aroused wonderful imaginations about the future, deeply feeling Chairman Mao's infinite concern for farmland water conservancy work.

Chairman Mao arrived at the Fulong Temple. This is the Li Bing Ancestral Temple built on "Lidui." Chairman Mao was in good health, and climbed dozens of stone steps with steady and brisk steps. Here, Chairman Mao watched the Dujiangyan model, the Dujiangyan irrigation area map, and the Baopingkou. When looking at the Dujiangyan model, Chairman Mao observed it very carefully, leaning over, and he pointed to the Feishayan spillway and asked Zhang Jianzhong:

"Wouldn't it be better to build a gate here? Isn't it?"

Zhang Jianzhong said: "Yes." Zhang Jianzhong not only completely agreed with this view, but he also thought in his heart: Chairman Mao is really an expert in farmland water conservancy.

Zhang Jianzhong pointed to the inner river on the side of Feishayan and told Chairman Mao: "Every year, during the annual maintenance, we dig mud and sand here."

Chairman Mao said with a smile: "Then after one million years, there will be nowhere to pile the sediment in the Chengdu Plain?"

Zhang Jianzhong said: "In the future, when a reservoir is built in the upper reaches of the Min River, there will be less sediment."

Chairman Mao nodded with pleasure. Everyone seemed to have already seen the future new look of this ancient project.

Arriving at the Baopingkou behind the Fulong Temple, the water flow here is rapid, and the surging spring water of the inner river irrigates the Chengdu Plain through here. Chairman Mao pointed to the rocks on both sides of the Baopingkou and asked: "Have the rocks here been washed away?"

Zhang Jianzhong said: "This is granite, very hard."

Chairman Mao asked with a smile: "After one million years, it may be destroyed, right?"

Everyone did not expect Chairman Mao to raise this question, and no one could answer for a while. Everyone felt that Chairman Mao's question suddenly made their vision deep and broad!

Chairman Mao looked down at the rapids of Baopingkou and asked Zhang Jianzhong how deep it was here and whether anyone had gone down to swim in the past.

Zhang Jianzhong said: "It is eight meters deep here, and no one has ever gone down."

Chairman Mao laughed heartily and said: "I want to go down."

Hearing Chairman Mao's words, everyone was secretly surprised. However, when everyone thought of Chairman Mao's feat of swimming across the Yangtze River the year before and saw Chairman Mao's physique so strong, they felt that this small Baopingkou was nothing in front of Chairman Mao!

Someone had spread the news that Chairman Mao was here. More than a hundred people quickly gathered outside the Fulong Temple. Many young students, Young Pioneers, and residents ran from afar to see Chairman Mao. When Chairman Mao walked out of the gate of Fulong Temple, the crowd immediately boiled. Everyone jumped and cheered: "Long live Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao is good!" People loved their leader and were eager to squeeze forward to see Chairman Mao more. Chairman Mao walked forward with a smile, waving to the cheering masses around him. At this time, the boiling crowd became even more boiling!

At more than seven o'clock in the afternoon, Chairman Mao left Guanxian and returned to Chengdu. On both sides of the road were golden rape flowers and dark green wheat seedlings. Chairman Mao got out of the car, crossed the small stone bridge on the left side of the road, and went to inspect the crops. This is the Lianhua No. 1 Cooperative of Xincheng Township, Guanxian County. 社员 Ran Guiquan was the first to see Chairman Mao, and he almost didn't believe his eyes. He didn't expect Chairman Mao to come here. Just as he didn't know what to say, Chairman Mao had already stepped into a lush wheat field, and the strong wheat seedlings surrounded Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao saw weeds in the wheat field and said kindly to Ran Guiquan:

"The weeds must be cleared."

Chairman Mao, like a skilled old farmer, while dialing the wheat seedlings with his hands, asked Ran Guiquan: "How many catties do you harvest per mu?"

While Ran Guiquan was still hesitating, Chairman Mao had already stretched out four fingers and asked him: "Four hundred catties?"

Ran Guiquan said: "Almost, four hundred and twenty or thirty catties per mu." At this time, the peasants who came around one after another were very surprised: Chairman Mao is in Beijing, busy with state affairs every day, how does he even know how much wheat can be harvested in the field.

Chairman Mao asked: "What do you plant after harvesting wheat?"

Ran Guiquan replied: "Plant rice."

Chairman Mao asked again: "How many catties of rice do you harvest per mu?"

Ran Guiquan replied: "More than six hundred catties."

At this time, Chairman Mao said to Comrade Li Jingquan:

"Four hundred plus more than six hundred is more than one thousand, which is remarkable."

Chairman Mao turned to Ran Guiquan and asked: "What if there is more grain?"

Ran Guiquan replied: "Sell it to the state."

Chairman Mao asked: "Sell it to the state, do you agree or disagree?"

Ran Guiquan said: "Of course I agree!"

Chairman Mao said with a smile to Ran Guiquan: "I think you don't quite agree, do you?!"

At this time, everyone around laughed. Although Ran Guiquan didn't laugh, he was more excited than anyone else in his heart. He felt that Chairman Mao in front of him was as kind as his father and brother.

Chairman Mao walked on the ridge. The peasants Gao Boran and his two children ran up to meet him. Chairman Mao asked Gao Boran how old he was and whether the children were in school. Gao Boran told Chairman Mao that he was fifty-eight years old and both children were in school.

Chairman Mao said happily: "Good!"

Walking along the ridge, Chairman Mao stepped into a sweet potato field, and several female cooperative members were picking sweet potatoes there. Chairman Mao walked and asked:

"What are you picking?"

Female cooperative member Wang Yinggang replied: "Picking sweet potatoes."

Chairman Mao said: "Would you like me to help you pick some?" As he said that, Chairman Mao bent down to pick sweet potatoes, and Chairman Mao handed a handful of tender green sweet potato tips to Wang Yinggang and asked: "Is this okay?"

Wang Yinggang stood up and held it with both hands and said repeatedly: "Okay! Okay!" Holding the sweet potatoes picked by Chairman Mao, Wang Yinggang and the other female cooperative members felt hot all over, they wanted to shout "Chairman Mao," but they were so excited that they couldn't shout.

Chairman Mao walked along a weedy dry ditch. At this time, several teenagers followed Chairman Mao closely, and Chairman Mao asked a teenager named Ren Guomin: "Do you know 'broken bowl flower'?"

Ren Guomin said: "I know it."

Chairman Mao picked a "broken bowl flower" and gave it to Ren Guomin, saying: "Dare you take it?"

Ren Guomin said: "I dare to take it," and reached out to take it.

Chairman Mao said with a smile: "You have to break the bowl!"

The teenager smiled, and the cooperative members all laughed. At first, the cooperative members were a little restrained when they saw Chairman Mao, but now, everyone felt that being with Chairman Mao was as close as a family and extremely warm!

When Chairman Mao was about to walk on the highway, the cooperative members in the field all came up, and Chairman Mao repeatedly called them good comrades and shook hands with them one by one. A cooperative member held Chairman Mao's hand tightly and said excitedly: "It's rare in a lifetime!" The cooperative members sent Chairman Mao to the road, and it was getting dark at this time. They watched Chairman Mao's car drive away, still reluctant to leave for a long time. Some cooperative members ran around all night after returning home, telling others: "Chairman Mao has been to our Lianhua No. 1 Cooperative!"

The next night, Lianhua No. 1 Cooperative held a cooperative member meeting. The cooperative members all said: "Being able to see Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness in a lifetime; Chairman Mao has seen the crops in our cooperative, which is the greatest happiness of the entire cooperative." So, they immediately changed the name of Lianhua No. 1 Cooperative to Happiness Cooperative. Everyone also rushed to say that they would use the action of striving for a bumper harvest to repay Chairman Mao's concern, and on the spot they formed eight shock brigades, deciding to launch a shock for three days, with the average household accumulating 120,000 catties of fertilizer (originally 60,000 catties). A cooperative member stood up and said: "I have a suggestion, we will write a letter to Chairman Mao to report after the harvest this year!" At this time, warm applause rang out in the entire venue.

That night, some fertilizer accumulation shock brigades acted with redoubled efforts.

### 毛主席来到了灌县

专栏：

    毛主席来到了灌县
    古老的都江堰的流水演奏起欢迎的乐曲，川西平原春意正浓。在3月的一个下午，一位穿着灰色制服、身材魁伟的人——我们敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席出现在灌县近旁的成阿公路上。
    毛主席走到公路旁边。这里是岷江左岸的一座高山，成阿公路盘旋到山腰以后，一直向西伸去。站在这里，山脚下波涛滚滚的岷江一览无余。毛主席拿上望远镜，仔细地察看了这个有二千二百多年历史的都江堰工程，还询问了都江鱼嘴、内江、外江和“杩槎”等工程情况。
    毛主席一面察看都江堰的工程，一面听着省委第一书记李井泉和都江堰管理处处长张建中讲述每年岁修的情况。
    毛主席关心的问：“每年岁修给不给民工的钱？”
    李井泉同志回答：“给的。”
    毛主席又问：“修一次要多少工？”
    张建中说：“大概要一百万民工。”
    毛主席说：“今后应该改用机器修，用卷扬机、掘土机，就省人力了。”毛主席又指着索桥下的都江鱼嘴对张建中说：“今后要想办法用现代化的工程，把泥沙控制起来！”
    听了毛主席的话，大家不禁想起了毛主席早在1934年说过的“水利是农业的命脉”这句话，也唤起了对未来的美妙想像，深感到毛主席对农田水利工作的无限关怀。
    毛主席来到了伏龙观。这是建筑在“离堆”上的李冰祀祠。毛主席身体很好，登上数十级的石阶，步子稳健、快捷。在这里，毛主席观看了都江堰模型、都江堰灌溉区域图和宝瓶口。在看都江堰模型的时候，毛主席伏着身子观察得很细致，他指着飞沙堰溢洪道问张建中：
    “这里修个闸不更好吗？是不是？”
    张建中说：“是的。”张建中不仅完全同意这个看法，而且他心里想：毛主席真是一个农田水利的老行家。
    张建中指着飞沙堰侧边的内江，告诉毛主席说：“每年岁修，就在这里挖泥、掏沙。”
    毛主席笑着说：“那一百万年以后，成都平原的泥沙就没处堆了？”
    张建中说：“将来岷江上游修了水库，泥沙就少了。”
    毛主席欣然地点了点头。大家也仿佛已经看到了这个古老工程未来的新面貌。
    到了伏龙观背后的宝瓶口，这里水流湍急，内江的滔滔春水，通过这里灌溉着成都平原。毛主席指着宝瓶口两边的岩石问：“这里岩石有没有被冲垮的？”
    张建中说：“这是粒岩，很坚硬。”
    毛主席又笑着问：“一百万年以后，可能要被冲毁吧？”
    大家没有料到毛主席提出这个问题，一时都答不上来。大家都感到：毛主席的问话，使自己的眼光突然深远、广阔起来！
    毛主席俯视宝瓶口的激流，又问张建中这里有多深，过去有没有人下去游过。
    张建中说：“这里有八公尺深，没有人下去过。”
    毛主席爽然地笑起来说：“我想下去。”
    听了毛主席这句话，大家都暗暗惊讶。但是，当大家想起毛主席前年横渡长江的事迹，又亲眼看见毛主席的体魄如此健壮时，觉得这小小的宝瓶口在毛主席的面前，又何足道！
    不知是谁把看见毛主席的消息传开了。伏龙观外面很快就聚集了一百多人。许多青年学生、少先队员和居民，都从远处跑来看望毛主席。当毛主席走出伏龙观大门的时候，人群立刻沸腾起来。大家跳跃着欢呼：毛主席万岁！毛主席好！人们热爱自己的领袖，都要争着挤上前去多看看毛主席。毛主席微笑着走上前去，向前后左右欢呼的群众招手致意。这时，沸腾的群众，更加沸腾起来！
    午后七点多钟，毛主席离开灌县回成都。公路两旁是一片片金黄色的油菜和油绿的麦苗。毛主席下车来，跨过公路左边的小石桥又去察看庄稼。这里是灌县新城乡莲花一社。社员冉贵全第一个看见毛主席，他几乎不相信自己的眼睛，他没有想到毛主席会来到这里。正在他不知说什么才好的时候，毛主席已经跨进了一块葱绿的麦田，茁壮的麦苗簇拥着毛主席。毛主席看见麦地里还有野草，和蔼地对冉贵全说：
    “要把草锄干净。”
    毛主席像一个熟练的老农，一面用手拨着麦苗，一面问冉贵全：“每亩收多少斤？”
    冉贵全还正在迟疑的时候，毛主席已经伸出了四个指头问他：“四百斤？”
    冉贵全说：“差不多，每亩四百二、三十斤。”这时，陆续围上来的农民都十分惊奇：毛主席在北京，每天忙于国家大事，怎么连地里能打多少麦子都知道。
    毛主席问：“割了麦子种什么？”
    冉贵全回答：“种水稻。”
    毛主席又问：“水稻每亩收多少斤？”
    冉贵全回答：“六百多斤。”
    这时，毛主席向李井泉同志说：
    “四百多加六百多，就是一千多，那可了不起。”
    毛主席又转向冉贵全问道：“粮食多了怎么办？”
    冉贵全回答：“卖给国家。”
    毛主席问：“卖给国家，你们赞成不赞成？”
    冉贵全说：“当然赞成！”
    毛主席笑着向冉贵全说：“我看你就有些不大赞成吧？！”
    这时，周围的人都笑起来了。冉贵全虽然没有笑，但是他的心里比谁都更激动，他感到面前的毛主席，如像自己父兄一样的亲切。
    毛主席走上田坎。农民高浡然和他的两个孩子迎面跑上前来。毛主席问高浡然多大年纪，孩子读书没有。高浡然告诉毛主席，他已五十八岁了，两个孩子都上了学。
    毛主席高兴地说：“好哇！”
    沿着田坎过去，毛主席跨进了一块苕菜田，几个女社员正在那里摘苕菜，毛主席边走边问：
    “你们摘什么？”
    女社员王应岗回答：“摘苕菜。”
    毛主席说：“我帮你们摘点好不好？”说着，毛主席就弯下腰去摘苕菜，毛主席摘了一把嫩绿的苕菜尖尖递给王应岗，问：“这行不行？”
    王应岗站起身来双手捧着连声说：“行！行！”捧着毛主席采摘的苕菜，王应岗和其他的女社员，都感到浑身热呼呼的，她们想喊一声“毛主席”，但又激动得喊不出来。
    毛主席沿着一条杂草丛生的干沟走去。这时，几个少年紧跟着毛主席的身边跑，毛主席问一个名叫任国民的少年说：“你认得‘打破碗花花’吗？”
    任国民说：“认得。”
    毛主席随手摘了一株“打破碗花花”给任国民，说：“你敢不敢拿？”
    任国民说：“敢拿”，就伸手去接。
    毛主席笑着说：“要打破碗啊！”
    少年笑了，社员们都笑了。最初社员们看到毛主席时还有些拘谨，现在，大家都感到和毛主席在一起，真是亲如一家，温暖无比！
    毛主席快走上公路的时候，田里的社员们都拥上来，毛主席连连称呼他们是好同志，和他们一一握手。一个社员紧握着毛主席的手，激动地说：一辈子也难得啊！社员们把毛主席一直送到公路上，这时天快黑了。他们看着毛主席的车子开去，仍久久不想离去。有的社员回家后连夜奔走，告诉别人说：“毛主席到我们莲花一社来过了！”
    第二天晚上，莲花一社召开了一个社员大会，社员们都说：能够看到毛主席，是一辈子最大的幸福；毛主席看了自己社里的庄稼，是全社最大的幸福。于是，他们就立即把莲花一社更名为幸福社。大家还抢着说，要用争取大丰收的行动来报答毛主席的关怀，当场就组成了八个突击队，决定突击三天，每户平均积肥要达到十二万斤（原来是六万斤）。一个社员站起来说：“我提个意见，我们要在今年丰收以后，写信报告毛主席！”这时，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
    当天夜晚，有的积肥突击队就干劲百倍地行动起来了。
