Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 31st. Another major new technology in China's steelmaking industry – using three rows of tuyeres to smelt converter steel – has recently been successfully tested for the first time at the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant.

According to the results of 246 furnace trials conducted by this steel plant in March, using three rows of tuyeres instead of two can shorten the smelting time per furnace of steel by 13% and reduce the iron loss rate by 27%. Based on this calculation, this steel plant can increase the nation's steel production by 19,500 tons this year. Most importantly, the quality of converter steel smelted with three rows of tuyeres can be improved to the level of open-hearth steel.

The converters at Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and other steel plants in Shanghai originally used single-row tuyeres. In 1957, the factory of the Central Laboratory of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company and Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant first added a row of tuyeres to the furnace shell, making it a double row, which significantly shortened the smelting time. Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant learned from their experience and recently changed the double row to three rows of tuyeres. The modification method is simple and easy to implement, costing only a few dozen yuan per furnace shell.

Responsible officials and representatives of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry attending the National Iron and Steel Industry Great Leap Forward Conference in Huangshi City believe that using converters to make steel requires less investment and yields quick results, allowing for the full utilization of China's dispersed iron ore resources. The three-row tuyere smelting method tested by Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant has changed the long-standing situation of low converter steel quality, making smelting both fast and good. This experience is worth promoting in converter steelmaking nationwide.

    改变转炉钢质量低的新技术
    三排风眼吹炼法试验成功
    上海第三钢厂的经验值得在全国炼钢转炉中推广
    新华社武汉31日电　我国炼钢工业的另一项重大新技术——用三排风眼吹炼转炉钢，最近在上海第三钢厂首次试验成功。
    据这个钢厂在3月份试炼二百四十六炉的结果，用三排风眼比用两排风眼吹炼，每炉钢的吹炼时间可以缩短13％，铁水吹损率可以降低27％。依此计算，这个钢厂今年可以为国家增产钢一万九千五百吨。特别重要的是，用三排风眼吹炼出来的转炉钢，质量可以提高到平炉钢质量的水平。
    上海第三钢厂和上海其他钢厂的转炉，本来都是用单排风眼吹炼的。1957年，上海钢铁公司中心试验室的工厂和上海第六钢厂，首先在炉壳上增开了一排风眼，成了双排，显著缩短了吹炼时间。上海第三钢厂学习了他们的经验，最近把双排改成了三排风眼。改的方法简单易行，每只炉壳只花了几十元。
    正在黄石市参加全国钢铁工业生产大跃进会议的冶金工业部有关部门负责人和代表们认为，用转炉炼钢，投资少，收效快，能够充分利用我国分散的铁矿资源。上海第三钢厂试验的三排风眼吹炼法，改变了长期以来转炉钢质量低的局面，炼得又快又好。这一经验值得在全国炼钢转炉中推广。
