    The U.S. State Department is at the End of its Rope

    On April 12th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country issued a statement, announcing the process of the recent four-month standstill in the Sino-U.S. talks and the exchange of letters between China and the United States. From these letters, people can clearly see that the long-term stagnation of the Sino-U.S. talks is entirely the result of the U.S. side's sabotage of the agreement and deliberate delay. However, the U.S. State Department's statement on April 14th attempted to distort the facts, quibble, and continue to delay.

    The U.S. State Department's statement was issued in response to the accusations made by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, this statement did not dare to answer the main facts and issues pointed out by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs head-on. The statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that since December of last year, the U.S. side has deliberately failed to send an ambassador-level representative, but instead appointed Martin, who does not have ambassadorial status, as the representative, attempting to lower the level of the talks and render the talks completely ineffective. This practice violated the agreement between the Chinese and U.S. governments on holding ambassador-level talks. However, the U.S. State Department's statement avoided answering this, instead irrelevantly talking about how Martin is a "veteran diplomat with seventeen years of experience" and has "specialized knowledge in Chinese language and Chinese affairs," and so on. This is truly absurd. However, this situation most powerfully proves that our accusations against the U.S. side for sabotaging the agreement and delaying the talks are irrefutable, thus exposing the U.S. side's completely exhausted and untenable stance.

    Precisely because of this, the U.S. State Department's statement brought up the agreement on the return of civilians of both sides and the so-called issue of not using force in the Taiwan area, to confuse right and wrong, attempting to cover up the U.S. side's responsibility for delaying the talks. But this is even more futile. Everyone knows that our government has always adopted a problem-solving attitude towards the issue of the return of civilians between China and the United States. After the Sino-U.S. ambassador-level talks reached an agreement on the issue of the return of civilians of both sides, our government actively and conscientiously implemented this agreement. Conversely, the United States violated the agreement, using all kinds of difficult, threatening, and persecuting means to obstruct the return of our overseas Chinese to China. These crimes have long been exposed to the world and cannot be denied. As for American prisoners in China, there are some; but American prisoners have violated Chinese law and must be sanctioned by Chinese law, and the United States has no right to interfere. It is not a glorious thing for Americans to commit crimes in China, but the U.S. State Department has been constantly making a big deal out of them. This will not have any other result except making the United States stink even more.

    The situation regarding the Taiwan issue is the same. Our government has long stated that the Chinese people do not want to fight a war with the United States, and our government is willing to sit down and negotiate with the United States to discuss and ease the tensions in the Taiwan area. Moreover, at the Sino-U.S. ambassador-level talks, our side has repeatedly put forward suggestions on the peaceful resolution of the disputes between China and the United States in the Taiwan area, but the U.S. side has always refused. People all over the world have seen that the United States has armed occupation of our territory Taiwan, has kept the U.S. Seventh Fleet near Taiwan for a long time, and has set up U.S. missiles and missile units in Taiwan. Isn't this the use of force? The U.S. occupation of our territory Taiwan and the use of Taiwan to create tensions and interfere in our internal affairs have already aroused condemnation from people all over the world. Now the U.S. State Department is actually taking this issue out to perfunctorily respond, vainly hoping that the Chinese people will recognize the U.S. aggressive act of forcefully occupying Taiwan. This is impossible under any circumstances.

    The U.S. State Department's statement once again shows that the U.S. side still wants to use this unreasonable means to delay the talks, delaying for as long as it can. This rogue tactic reminds people of the situation of the Panmunjom negotiations. At that time, the U.S. representative was accustomed to using the method of "absconding from the meeting" to delay the negotiations, leaving a shameful record in diplomatic history. However, it seems that the U.S. government does not feel ashamed of this, so it has now moved the set of tricks from Panmunjom to Geneva. The United States deliberately did not send a representative to the Geneva ambassador-level talks for a long time, which is actually "absconding from the meeting."

    The unreasonable attitude adopted by the United States towards the Sino-U.S. ambassador-level talks is not accidental. Since the Sino-U.S. talks began in August 1955, the U.S. side has stubbornly refused many positive suggestions put forward by our side and has used various means to obstruct the progress of the talks. Now, the U.S. ruling group feels that it is not enough to just do this. They are afraid that these talks will help ease international tensions, which will be even more detrimental to the U.S. Cold War policy, so they want to further render these talks ineffective. However, under the pressure of people all over the world demanding the easing of international tensions, and under the pressure of broad public opinion in the United States demanding the improvement of Sino-U.S. relations, the U.S. ruling group does not dare to take open actions to sabotage the Sino-U.S. talks. It is in this situation that the United States has resorted to rogue tactics. It has been using the tactic of stalling for four months, on the one hand by not sending an ambassador-level representative for a long time, and on the other hand by sending a person without ambassadorial status as a front.

    The people of our country resolutely oppose this rogue and deceptive practice of the United States. We believe that holding Sino-U.S. ambassador-level talks is an international agreement jointly reached by China and the United States. How the U.S. side intends to treat this agreement and whether it is willing to continue the talks completely depends on itself.

### 美国国务院理屈辞穷

    美国国务院理屈辞穷
    4月12日，我国外交部发表声明，公布了最近四个月来中美会谈停顿的经过和中美双方来往的信件。从这些信件中，人们已经可以清楚地看到，中美会谈所以长期停顿，完全是由于美方破坏协议故意拖延的结果。但是，美国国务院4月14日的声明，却企图歪曲事实，进行狡辩，继续拖延。
    美国国务院的声明，是为了回答我国外交部的指责而发的。然而这个声明对于我国外交部所指出的主要事实和问题却根本不敢正面回答。我国外交部的声明曾指出，自从去年12月以来，美方故意不派大使级代表，而指派不具大使身份的马丁为代表，企图降低会谈的级别，使会谈根本失去作用，这种做法违背了中美两国政府关于举行大使级会谈的协议。可是美国国务院的声明对此避而不答，却风马牛不相及地大谈什么马丁是“具有十七年经验的老资格的外交官”，并且“在中国语言和中国事务方面都有专门的知识”等等。这真是荒唐之至。不过，这种情况倒是最有力地证明了我方对美方破坏协议拖延会谈的指责，是无法辩驳的，因而美方露出了完全理屈辞穷的丑态。
    正是因为这样，美国国务院的声明又搬出关于双方平民返国的协议和所谓不在台湾地区使用武力问题，来颠倒黑白，企图掩盖美方拖延会谈的责任。可是这更是无济于事的。谁都知道，我国政府对中美双方平民回国问题一直采取解决问题的态度。在中美大使级会谈达成了关于双方平民回国问题的协议以后，我国政府积极认真地执行了这个协议。相反地，美国则违反协议，用尽种种刁难、威胁、迫害的手段，阻挠我国侨民回国。这些罪行早已大白于世，无法抵赖。至于在中国的美国犯人，那是有的；但是美国犯人犯了中国法律，就要受中国法律制裁，美国无权干涉。美国人在中国犯了罪，本来并不是什么光彩的事情，但是美国国务院却利用他们不断地大做文章。这除了把美国自己越弄越臭以外，是不会有什么别的结果的。
    关于台湾问题的情况也是一样。我国政府早就声明过，中国人民不要同美国打仗，我国政府愿意同美国坐下来谈判，讨论和缓和消除台湾地区的紧张局势问题。而且，在中美大使级会谈上，我方也曾一再提出关于和平解决中美两国在台湾地区的争端的建议，但是美方一直加以拒绝。全世界人民都看到，美国武装侵占我国领土台湾，把美国第七舰队长期摆在台湾附近，并且在台湾设置美国导弹和导弹部队，这还不是使用武力？美国侵占我国领土台湾并利用台湾制造紧张局势，干涉我国内政，已经引起全世界人民的谴责。现在美国国务院居然拿这个问题出来搪塞，妄想中国人民承认美国武力霸占台湾的侵略行为。这无论如何是办不到的。
    美国国务院的声明又一次表明，美方仍然想用这种无理取闹的手段，来拖延会谈，能拖一天就多拖一天。这种无赖的手段使人又想起板门店谈判的情况。那时候，美方代表就惯于使用“逃会”的办法来拖延谈判，在外交史上留下了可耻的纪录。但是，看来美国政府却并不以为耻，所以它现在又把板门店的那一套伎俩搬到日内瓦来了。美国故意长期不派代表出席日内瓦大使级会谈，这实际上就是“逃会”。
    美国对中美大使级会谈所采取的这种无理态度，并不是偶然的。自从1955年8月中美会谈开始举行以来，美方就一再顽固地拒绝我方提出的许多积极建议，并且利用种种手段阻挠会谈取得进展。现在，美国统治集团又感到，仅仅这样做还嫌不够。他们害怕这个会谈会有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，从而更加不利于美国的冷战政策，所以就想进一步使这个会谈失去作用。可是，在全世界人民要求缓和国际紧张局势的压力下，在美国广大舆论要求改善中美关系的压力下，美国统治集团又不敢采取破坏中美会谈的公开行动。正是在这样的形势下，美国就把耍无赖的办法搬出来了。它一边长期不派大使级代表，一边又派一个不具大使身份的人在那里作幌子，已经使中美会谈停顿了四个月之久。
    我国人民坚决反对美国这种耍无赖的骗人的做法。我们认为，举行中美大使级会谈，这是中美两国共同达成的一个国际协议，美方究竟打算怎样对待这个协议，究竟愿不愿继续会谈，这完全要看它自己了。
