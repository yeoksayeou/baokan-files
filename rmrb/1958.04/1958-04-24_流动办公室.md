    Mobile Office
    (Our newspaper from Dalian-Lushun, April 23rd) The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory has recently adopted the "mobile office" method, going deep into the workshops on a tour, studying problems on the spot, and solving problems on the spot. This has changed the practice of "being high above and passing things down level by level," solving problems more, faster, and better, and has been warmly welcomed by the workers.
    This factory adopted the leadership method of the "mobile office" based on the experience of Hong'an County, Hubei Province. The "mobile office" is headed by the factory director and temporarily draws relevant department personnel based on the nature and situation of the problems that arise in the workshop, going deep into the workshop to solve problems or inspect work together with the workers. It is organized three or four times a week. In the past, when a workshop had a problem to be solved by the factory director, the factory director mostly passed it on to the relevant department, and the department often passed it on and on, and many problems could not be solved quickly; some problems, the factory director decided on a solution based only on a report, without consulting with relevant personnel, and without going deep into reality to take a look, so it was inevitable that there were impracticalities. After adopting the leadership method of the "mobile office," the various bad phenomena of the past disappeared. The workshops all have a very good response to the "mobile office." Some workshop directors said: "In the past, if you went to them with a problem, they wouldn't solve it, but now they come to your door to solve problems."

    流动办公室
    本报旅大23日电　大连机车车辆厂最近采取“流动办公室”的方法，巡回深入车间，在现场研究问题、在现场解决问题，改变了“高高在上，层层批转”的作法，又多又快又好地解决问题，受到职工的热烈欢迎。
    这个厂是根据湖北红安县的经验采取“流动办公室”的领导方法的。“流动办公室”以厂长为首，根据车间出现问题的性质和情况，临时抽调有关科室人员组成，深入车间，和职工一起解决问题或检查工作。每星期组织三四次。过去，车间有什么问题找厂长解决，厂长多半是批给有关科室，而科室往往批转来批转去，许多问题不能很快解决；有些问题，厂长只凭一纸报告就决定了解决办法，没有同有关人员商量，又没有深入实际看一看，所以难免有不切实际的地方。采取“流动办公室”的领导方法之后，已往的种种不良现象没有了。车间对“流动办公室”的反映都很好。有的车间主任说：“过去有问题找上门去还不给解决，现在找上门来解决问题了。”
