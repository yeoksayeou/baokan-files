    French Cabinet Formation Fails
    Bidault's Attempt Collapses
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 23rd: Bidault, who was tasked on the evening of the 20th with trying to form a new French government, announced last night that his efforts to organize the twenty-fifth government in post-war France had failed. President Coty then decided to allow former Prime Minister and right-wing leader of the Democratic Social Resistance Union, Pflimlin, to try to end the week-long government crisis.
    Bidault is the leader of the right wing of the Popular Republican Movement. He had to abandon the idea of becoming Prime Minister again after his own party refused to support his "iron fist policy" in North Africa.

    法国内阁难产
    皮杜尔组阁失败
    据新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：20日晚上受命设法组织法国新政府的皮杜尔，在昨天晚上宣布，他筹划组织法国战后第二十五个政府的活动已经失败。总统戈蒂接着就决定让前总理、民主社会抵抗联盟右翼领袖普利文出来尝试结束延续了一个星期的政府危机。
    皮杜尔是人民共和党右翼的领袖。他是在他自己的党拒绝支持他对北非的“铁腕政策”之后，不得不打消重新当总理的念头的。
