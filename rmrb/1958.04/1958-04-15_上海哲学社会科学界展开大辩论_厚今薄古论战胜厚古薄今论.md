    Shanghai Philosophical and Social Science Circles Launch Major Debate
    "Valuing the Present, Devaluing the Past" Argument Wins Over "Valuing the Past, Devaluing the Present" Argument
    (Our Correspondent Yu Huiyin reports) Should we value the present and devalue the past, or value the past and devalue the present? For the past twenty-odd days, Shanghai's philosophical and social science circles have engaged in a broad and heated debate on this issue.
    The debate involved various disciplines including Chinese language, foreign languages, history, philosophy, economics, and law. In related universities and scientific research institutions throughout the city, all teachers, students, and researchers were drawn into the great debate.
    More than ten different viewpoints emerged during the debate, but in essence, there were only two factions: those advocating for valuing the present and devaluing the past, and those advocating for valuing the past and devaluing the present. Those who advocated for valuing the past and devaluing the present believed that our ancestors left behind a rich cultural heritage, which could inspire our labor and struggle, and promote the development of modern culture. Such a rich cultural heritage is our pride, and it is wrong not to value it. Ancient history spans thousands of years, modern history only a hundred years, and contemporary history only a few decades. It is natural for ancient studies and teaching to carry more weight. The ancient cultural heritage has not yet been fully explored. To advocate for devaluing the past is to forget our roots, to sever history. The present develops from the past; there is no antagonistic contradiction between the past and the present. Why devalue the past to value the present? Why overcorrect?
    Some people conducted self-criticism of their past tendency to value the past and devalue the present, and realized the correctness of the principle of valuing the present and devaluing the past from their personal experience. They pointed out that because these social science workers concentrated their efforts on the research and teaching of ancient history and classical works, associating with the ancients for a long time, coupled with an insufficiently correct standpoint and inadequate analysis and criticism, it was easy to lead people to cherish the past, admire antiquity and despise the present, evade the great revolutionary struggle and production struggle of the present, and lose their way in real life and academic research. This tendency to value the past and devalue the present prevented philosophy and social science from actively serving socialism and hindered the development of the disciplines themselves, which had a retarding effect on the education of the younger generation. The struggle between valuing the present and devaluing the past and valuing the past and devaluing the present is precisely the struggle between two roads in philosophy and social science.
    Those who advocated for valuing the present and devaluing the past pointed out that only by valuing the present and devaluing the past can philosophy and social science both reflect the essence of the times and act as pioneers of the times. China's modern social life is certainly richer and more progressive than any era in the past. All aspects are experiencing a great leap forward, and there are countless meaningful problems in real life that need to be studied. It is entirely necessary to mobilize and cultivate a large number of people to study these problems. For people living in the twentieth century not to study twentieth-century problems is precisely to sever this stage of history for our future generations. Valuing the present does not mean abandoning the past. In valuing the present, we should attach great importance to and cherish the cultural heritage. However, those who study the ancient should also understand contemporary life and be able to apply the Marxist-Leninist standpoint and methods. Only in this way can ancient history be studied well and make the ancients serve the present.
    After many large and small meetings for debate, everyone's opinions gradually converged, and more and more people agreed with valuing the present and devaluing the past. However, so far, not all ideological problems have been resolved. Judging from the symposium of representatives from Shanghai's philosophical and social science circles held on the 13th and recent debates in various units, everyone generally agrees with valuing the present and devaluing the past in principle, but in the depths of some people's minds, there are still various concerns. Some people worried that "what is propped up in the east will fall in the west," that a gust of wind would come and devaluing the past would turn into abandoning the past, that their academic expertise would be useless, and that their personal future would be gone. In the past, some people emphasized that being able to quote extensively from ancient documents was considered knowledgeable, while studying current issues could only quote generally understandable newspapers, magazines, and articles, which was not considered knowledge. After the great debate, they also felt that current issues were very complex, with a myriad of threads, and difficult to study. Some people advocated that old professors and experts should still study the ancient, while young people, who had no foundation in either the ancient or the present, could be trained to study modern and contemporary issues. Many people were also afraid of making mistakes when studying current issues. They said that studying ancient history involves dealing with dead people, and at most, one makes academic mistakes. Current issues are closely related to politics, and it is easy to make political mistakes. These worries and thoughts reflect that many people in the academic world have not yet freed themselves from their wistful sentiments for the past, and the bourgeois ideas of personal fame and gain and bourgeois academic ideas are hindering them from correctly understanding and implementing the policy of valuing the present and devaluing the past.
    At the symposium of representatives from Shanghai's philosophical and social science circles on the 13th to discuss the issue of valuing the present and devaluing the past, Chen Qiwu, vice chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Philosophical and Social Science Societies and member of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his concluding remarks that valuing the present and devaluing the past is a great revolution in academic thought, with the aim of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie. It guides people to look forward rather than backward. This is a fundamental issue related to the transformation of intellectuals and the shift in their stand. The implementation of this policy still requires arduous struggle. Difficulties cannot discourage us. As long as the direction is right, the standpoint is correct, and we dare to face reality and correct mistakes, we will have the courage to think boldly and create bravely. In this way, in the process of promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie, there will emerge a lively academic prosperity and a great scientific development.

    上海哲学社会科学界展开大辩论
    厚今薄古论战胜厚古薄今论
    本报讯　记者余辉音报道：究竟应该厚今薄古还是厚古薄今？最近的二十多天中，上海哲学社会科学界就这个问题展开了广泛而热烈的大辩论。
    大辩论涉及到中文、外文、历史、哲学、经济、法律的各个学科，在全市有关的高等学校和科学研究所里，所有的教师、学生和研究人员都卷入了大争大辩。
    辩论中出现了十多种不同的论点，但从实质上看只有厚今薄古和厚古薄今两派。主张厚古薄今的人们认为：我们祖先留下了丰富的文化遗产，它可以鼓舞我们的劳动和斗争，可以促进现代文化的发展，这样丰富的文化遗产，正是我们的骄傲，不厚是不对的。古代历史有几千年，近代历史只有百余年，现代历史只有几十年。古代的研究和教学分量重一些是很自然的，古代文化遗产尚未充分发掘提倡，薄古这是忘本，就是割断历史；今是从古发展来的，古和今不存在对立的矛盾，厚今何必薄古，矫枉何必过正。
    有些人对过去的厚古薄今倾向进行了自我批判，从切身体会中感到厚今薄古方针的正确。他们指出，由于这些社会科学工作者集中力量于古代历史和古典作品的研究和教学，长期和古人为伍，加上立场观点不够正确，分析批判不够充分，很容易引导人们留恋过去，怀古鄙今，逃避当前伟大的革命斗争和生产斗争，在现实生活中和学术研究中迷失方向。这种厚古薄今的倾向使哲学和社会科学不能积极为社会主义服务，妨碍了学科本身的发展，这对青年一代的教育上起着促退作用。厚今薄古和厚古薄今的斗争正是哲学社会科学中两条道路的斗争。
    主张厚今薄古的人们指出：只有厚今薄古，哲学社会科学才能作到一面反映时代的精华，一面作时代的先导。我国现代社会生活肯定比过去任何时代都要丰富和进步，各方面都在大跃进，现实生活中有无数有意义的问题需要研究。调动和培养大量的人力研究这些问题是完全必要的，生活在二十世纪的人不研究二十世纪的问题，对我们的子孙后代说来正是割断了这一阶段的历史。厚今并不是废古，厚今对文化遗产是应该十分重视和爱护的，但研究古代的人也应该懂得现时生活，会运用马列主义的立场方法，只有这样才能把古代史研究好，使古人为今人服务。
    经过许多次大会小会的辩论，大家的意见逐渐一致，赞成厚今薄古的人愈来愈多。但是到目前为止，还不是所有的思想问题都已得到解决。从13日举行的上海哲学社会科学界代表人士座谈会和各单位最近的辩论会看来，大家原则上都同意厚今薄古，但是在一些人的思想深处还存在着种种忧虑。有些人担心“扶得东来西又倒”，一阵风刮来，薄古会变成废古，自己的学问专长没有用了，个人前途没有了。有些人过去强调能够在古文献中旁征博引才算有学问，研究现实问题只能引用一般人也能看懂的报刊杂志和文章，算不得学问。经过大辩论，他们又感到现时问题很复杂，千头万绪，研究起来也很困难，有的人就主张老教授老专家仍旧研究古代，青年人对古和今都没有底子，可以培养他们研究近代现代问题。还有不少人害怕研究现时问题容易犯错误，他们说，研究古史与死人打交道，顶多犯个学术性的错误，现时问题与政治息息相关，容易犯政治性错误。这些忧虑和想法都反映出：学术界有不少人还没有从思古的幽情中解脱出来，资产阶级的个人名利、个人得失思想和资产阶级的学术思想妨碍了他们正确地理解和贯彻厚今薄古的方针。
    在13日的哲学社会科学界代表人士讨论厚今薄古问题的座谈会上，上海市哲学社会科学学会联合会副主席、中共上海市委委员陈其五最后发言，他说厚今薄古是学术思想上的大革命，目的是兴无灭资，它引导人们向前看，而不是向后看，这是关系到知识分子改造和立场转变的根本问题，这个方针的贯彻还需要经过艰苦的斗争，困难不能使我们气馁，只要方向对头了，立场站对了，敢于面对现实，敢于修正错误，我们就有勇气大胆思想，勇敢创造，这样在兴无灭资的斗争过程中就会出现一个生龙活虎的学术大繁荣，科学大发展的局面。
