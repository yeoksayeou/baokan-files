Ping Opera's "Home"

The "Home" performed by the China Ping Opera Theater begins with the "painful farewell" of Juexin and Cousin Mei. The plot basically follows the outline of Cao Yu's play, but some plot points are explained in more detail than in the play.

In the play, Juexin and Ruijue's poetic monologue in the bridal chamber becomes a beautiful duet here. The directors of the Ping Opera "Home" also did not miss the scene of Mingfeng's suicide, which is most likely to move the audience. Mingfeng first sings of her yearning for love and happiness, and finally sings of the ugliness of the Gao family and her own suffering. Xiaobai Yushuang, who plays Ruijue, and Yu Ping, who plays Mingfeng, both perform earnestly and sing a lot and well, which will satisfy audiences who love to listen to Ping Opera.

### 评剧的“家”

    评剧的“家”
    中国评剧院演的“家”是以觉新和梅表妹“痛别”开头的，剧情基本上按照曹禺的话剧剧本的脉络发展下去，但有些情节要比话剧交代得详尽些。
    话剧里觉新和瑞珏在洞房中诗意的独白，在这里变成优美的对唱。评剧“家”的编导者也没有放过最能感动观众的鸣凤自杀一场，鸣凤始而唱出对爱情、幸福的向往，最后又唱出高家的丑恶和自己的苦痛。演瑞珏的小白玉霜和演鸣凤的于萍都演得认真，唱得又多又好，爱听评剧的观众是会感到满意的。
