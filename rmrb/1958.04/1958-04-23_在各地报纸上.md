　　In Local Newspapers
　　New Long Dragon
　　On the 20th, Shanghai newspapers published a very fresh piece of news: The 19th was the first day for Shanghai educated youths to sign up to participate in rural construction in Hubei and Anhui. On this day, more than 11,000 people in the city signed up. In front of many registration stations, young people eager to go to the countryside spontaneously formed a long, winding line. Many young people went to line up before dawn.
　　The Wenhui Daily titled the news "A New Long Dragon Appears in Shanghai," and the Xinwen Daily's headline was "Shanghai Educated Youths Eager to Go to the Countryside, Ten Thousand People Scramble to Sign Up Overnight."

　　Producing Wine, Vinegar, and Soy Sauce
　　Without a Single Grain
　　The Wuzhai Winery is a local state-owned winery in the mountainous area of northwestern Shanxi. In the past, its production relied heavily on state grain supplies. Due to insufficient grain, its production was very sluggish and could not meet the needs of the nine nearby counties. During the recent Great Leap Forward, the winery's staff went to the countryside and mountains to conduct investigations and found more than 30 kinds of non-grain raw materials that could be used for brewing wine, making vinegar, making starch, making soy sauce, making maltose, and pressing oil. These raw materials include yams, yam dregs, vinegar willow, wild grapes, crabapples, cocklebur seeds, etc. They have now successfully trial-produced a variety of products. They plan to use old equipment and existing resources to increase oil pressing and the production of local sugar, turning the winery into a comprehensive food factory, which will not only increase the variety of products, but also save the state two million catties of grain annually. This news was published in the Shanxi Daily on the 20th, along with this interesting illustration.

　　Glutinous Rice and Sticky Rice
　　The Dong and Miao farmers in Congjiang County, Guizhou Province, have been accustomed to planting only glutinous rice for generations. They believe that glutinous rice is "human grain" and sticky rice is "dog grain." However, glutinous rice not only has a yield that is 20% to 30%, or even 50%, lower than sticky rice, but it also requires twice as much labor and matures later. This year, after a great debate, the Dong and Miao farmers of the whole county broke with outdated production rules and resolved to catch up with advanced areas. They plan to increase the planting area of sticky rice from the original 20% to 70%. This single reform will increase grain production by more than 13 million catties. The first batch of seeds has already been planted in the fields, twenty days earlier than last year. The Guizhou Daily published this news on the front page on the 17th.

　　Wooden Railways and Earth Automobiles
　　There is new development in tool reform. On the 19th, several news items on the second page of the Hubei Daily were very attractive. Baokang County is vigorously developing light railways (made of wood), connecting the pulleys and cars into a whole transportation system. Various places are extending light railways, and pulleys have been erected in areas with hills and rivers, thus connecting societies and societies, townships and townships, cities and villages, mountains and rivers, water and land. In addition, it was also reported that the masses of Wangjia Cooperative had successfully created earth automobiles, and the Hongxing No. 1 Cooperative had successfully made "diesel-powered trains."

　　Eight Wild Plants Can Kill Maggots
　　Recently, the masses in various parts of Anhui have collected eight kinds of wild plants that can kill maggots. After identification by the Drug Inspection Institute of the Provincial Health Department, the maggot-killing effect is very good, and it does not affect the fertility of manure. The Anhui Provincial Headquarters for Eliminating the Four Pests has notified various places to collect them in large quantities. These eight kinds of wild plants are: Macleaya cordata, Rhododendron molle, Buddleja davidii, Veratrum nigrum, Euphorbia helioscopia, Pieris japonica, Veratrum maackii, and Polygonum hydropiper. The Anhui Daily reported this on the 20th and published photos of the eight plants.

　　Little Brother of the Double-Share Plow
　　Xie Zhangguang, manager of the production professional store of the Xiaohu District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jianyang, Fujian, and carpenter Li Xingbiao recently imitated the style of the double-wheeled double-share plow and successfully trial-produced a wooden wheel-less double-share plow. It is suitable for cultivating small hilly fields and mountainous fields with many mountain roads. Its advantages are as follows: (1) The working efficiency is about 80% higher than the original old plow, only 20%-30% less than the double-wheeled double-share plow. (2) The plow body is light, convenient and durable, and can be used in mountain ridges or paddy fields and farmland. (3) One person and one cow can operate it, and people who cannot plow the fields can also use it. (4) The cost is low (the initial budget is only about 25 yuan), and the manufacturing is simple. The Fujian Daily reported this news on the 17th, calling it the little brother of the double-wheeled double-share plow.

    新的长龙
    20日，上海各报登出了一条很新鲜的消息：19日是上海知识青年报名参加湖北、安徽农村建设的第一天，这一天全市就有一万一千多人报了名。在许多报名站的门前，热情要求下乡的年轻人自动地排起了一字长蛇阵。不少青年在天亮以前就去排队了。
    文汇报为这条消息拟的标题是“上海出现新的长龙”，新闻日报的标题是“社会知识青年下乡心切，万人连夜争先报名”。
    生产酒醋酱
    不用一颗粮
    五寨酒厂是晋西北山区一个地方国营酒厂，过去生产多依靠国家粮食供应，由于粮食不足，它的生产很不景气，不能满足附近九县的需要。在最近大跃进声中，这个厂的人员下乡上山调查访问，找到可供酿酒、制醋、制淀粉、酱油、饴糖、榨油等非粮食的原料三十多种。这些原料有山药蛋、山药渣、醋柳、山葡萄、海棠、苍耳籽等。现已试制成功多种产品。他们计划利用旧设备和现有资源，增加榨油、制土糖等，变成一个综合性的食品厂，不但产品增多，全年还可为国家节约粮食二百万斤。这个消息载20日的山西日报，还配了下面这个有趣的小插图。
    糯谷和粘谷
    贵州省从江县的侗族、苗族农民，世世代代只习惯种糯谷，他们认为糯谷是“人粮”，粘谷是“狗粮”。可是，糯谷不光产量比粘谷低20％至30％，甚至低50％，而且费工多一倍，成熟期又晚。今年经过大辩论，全县侗、苗族农民，大破生产陈规，决心赶上先进地区，计划把粘谷栽种面积由原来20％，增加到70％，仅这一项改革，即可增产一千三百多万斤粮食。目前首批谷种已经下田，比去年提前了二十天。17日贵州日报在一版头条地位刊登了这条消息。
    木铁道和土汽车
    工具改革又有新的发展。19日湖北日报的二版上，有几条消息很吸引人。保康县正在大搞轻便铁道（木头做的），把滑丝和车子联成运输整体。各地都在延长轻便铁道，有山岗和河流的地区架起了滑丝，这样就使社与社、乡与乡、城与乡、山与川、水与陆都相联起来。此外，还报道了望家社群众创制成功土汽车，和红星一社制成功的“柴油动力火车”。八种野生植物能灭蛆
    安徽各地群众最近搜集到八种可以灭蛆的野生植物。经省卫生厅药品检验所鉴定，杀蛆效力很好，而且不影响粪肥的肥力。安徽省除四害总指挥部已通知各地大量采集。这八种野生植物是：博落回、闹羊花、醉鱼草、藜芦、泽漆、马醉木、木藜芦、马蓼草。20日安徽日报作了报道，并刊出了八种植物的照片。
    双铧犁的小兄弟
    福建建阳小湖区供销社生产专业商店经理谢章光和木匠李兴标两人，最近模仿双轮双铧犁的式样，试制成功了一种木质无轮双铧犁。它适宜山区小丘田和山路多的山田耕作。它的好处有以下几点：（一）比原来旧犁工作效率可提高80％左右，仅差双轮双铧犁20％——30％。（二）犁身轻便、耐用，同时在山垅或水田、农地都可使用。（三）一人一牛就可操作，不会犁田的人也能使用。（四）成本低（初步预算一部只要二十五元左右），制造简便。17日的福建日报报道了这个消息，称之为双轮双铧犁的小兄弟。
