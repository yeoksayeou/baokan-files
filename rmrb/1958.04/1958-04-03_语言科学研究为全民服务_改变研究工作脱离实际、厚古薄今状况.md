Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. At the symposium on the Great Leap Forward in language science research work convened by the State Council's Science Planning Commission on March 29th, many language science researchers stated: To achieve a Great Leap Forward in research work, it is first necessary to clarify the direction and methodology of research, change the situation of research work being divorced from reality and valuing the past over the present, so that research work truly starts from the practical needs of the whole people and serves the whole people. Researchers must overcome bourgeois ideology; science is a collective endeavor, and currently, it is especially important to emphasize division of labor and collaboration.

The symposium was presided over by Wei Jiangong, Lü Shuxiang, and Ji Xianlin.

Wei Que said at the meeting that the Great Leap Forward in production will inevitably drive the Great Leap Forward in cultural and educational work; the Great Leap Forward in cultural and educational work will inevitably drive the Great Leap Forward in language science. Because the development of culture and science needs to rely on language. He believes that the current situation of the Great Leap Forward in culture and education puts forward three requirements for language science research work: accelerate the reform of writing, making it easier for the masses of people to master the mother tongue; those who have a preliminary grasp of Chinese characters need more and better tools for learning language; and accelerate the work of standardizing the Chinese language. He said that language science research work must have a mass perspective and first solve the practical problems of the masses. He requested that language and writing first be popularized, and then focus on improvement based on popularization. Li Jinxi proposed that future work on writing reform must be closely integrated with the needs of the country, such as promoting simplified Chinese characters and Hanyu Pinyin, first to help eliminate illiteracy and help elementary school students learn to read and learn Mandarin. The Chinese language courses in higher normal colleges must be combined with reality, students, and middle schools. Lü Shuxiang believes that in the current research on the Chinese language, there is generally more research on modern Chinese, which is correct; however, there is more concentrated research on Chinese grammar, and there are still few people researching other urgent problems, such as phonetics, vocabulary, phonetic writing, and language teaching.

Lü Shuxiang requested at the meeting that all relevant departments achieve the goal of making the best use of talents and resources in language science research, and that talents and equipment should be shared. He said that the Institute of Linguistics is currently compiling a medium-sized modern Chinese dictionary, which requires support from all aspects in terms of editing manpower and data. Fu Maoji of the Institute of Nationalities Languages specifically requested in his speech that Professor Yuan Jiahua of Peking University cooperate with them to carry out research on minority languages. Li Jinxi believes that after comprehensive collaboration, the following can be achieved: rational division of labor, potential emergence; specialized cooperation, efficiency improvement.

Many language science researchers pointed out that they formulated new research plans after criticizing bourgeois ideology and research styles. Gao Mingkai, representing the teachers engaged in linguistics teaching and scientific research in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of Peking University, mentioned in the content of the plan that they would assist the Institute of Linguistics in compiling a good medium-sized modern Chinese dictionary. They will also conduct research on Chinese lexicology, new writing spelling, Marxist-Leninist linguistics, etc., and do a good job in cultivating new forces. Cheng Zhenqiu, Meng Fu, Bai Rui, and others raised issues such as research in foreign languages and the cultivation of new forces. Wei Jiangong pointed out that in the past, the research of foreign linguistics and the research of Chinese were separated, and this meeting will become the beginning of a better combination of the two research works. The participants in this meeting included language science researchers from the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Nationalities Languages, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, and some universities in Beijing.

    语言科学研究为全民服务
    改变研究工作脱离实际、厚古薄今状况
    新华社1日讯　在国务院科学规划委员会3月29日召开的语言科学研究工作大跃进的座谈会上，很多语言科学研究工作者表示：要研究工作大跃进，首先要明确研究方向和研究方法问题，改变研究工作脱离实际、厚古薄今的状况，使研究工作真正从全民的实际需要出发，为全民服务。研究工作者要克服资产阶级思想，科学是集体事业，当前要特别强调分工协作。
    座谈会由魏建功、吕叔湘、季羡林主持。
    韦悫在会上说，生产大跃进必然带动文化教育工作大跃进；文化教育工作大跃进必然带动语言科学大跃进。因为文化科学的发展需要依靠语言。他认为，目前文化教育大跃进的形势对语言科学研究工作提出三点要求：加快进行文字改革，使人民大众容易掌握祖国文字；初步掌握汉字的，要求有更多、更好的学习语文的工具；要求加速汉语规范化工作。他说，语言科学研究工作必须有群众观点，首先解决群众的实际问题。他要求语言文字先来个普及，在普及的基础上重点提高。黎锦熙提出，今后的文字改革工作必须密切结合国家的需要，如推广简化汉字和汉语拼音，首先要为帮助扫除文盲，帮助小学生识字和学习普通话服务。高等师范院校的汉语课程必须结合实际，结合学生，结合中学。吕叔湘认为，目前在汉语的研究方面，一般的研究现代汉语多，这是正确的；但是集中研究汉语语法多，其他如语音、词汇、拼音文字、语言教学等迫切要研究的问题，研究的人还很少。
    吕叔湘在会上要求各有关部门在语言科学研究上，做到人尽其才，物尽其用，人才、设备要互通有无。他说，目前语言研究所正在编辑中型现代汉语辞典，就需要各方面支援编辑力量和资料。少数民族语言研究所傅懋绩在发言中具体提出要求北京大学教授袁家骅和他们协作，开展少数民族语言研究工作。黎锦熙认为全面大协作以后，可以达到：合理分工，潜力涌现；专长合作，效率提高。
    很多语言科学研究工作者指出，他们都是在批判了资产阶级思想和研究作风以后，制定了新的研究规划。高名凯代表北京大学中国语言文学系从事语言学教学和科学研究工作的教师提出的规划内容中，就提到将协助语言研究所编好中型现代汉语辞典。他们还要进行汉语词汇学、新文字拼写法、马克思列宁主义语言学等方面的研究，并且要作好新生力量的培养工作。程镇球、孟复、白锐等提出了外国语言学方面的研究和培养新生力量等问题。魏建功指出，在过去，外国语言学的研究和汉语的研究是脱节的，这次会议将成为两者的研究工作更好结合的开端。参加这次会议的有中国科学院语言研究所，少数民族语言研究所，中国文字改革委员会，以及北京部分高等学校等方面的语言科学研究工作者。
