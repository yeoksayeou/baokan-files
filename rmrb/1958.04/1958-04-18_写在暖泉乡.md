    Writing in Nuanquan Township
    Xu Chi
    Nuanquan Township in Huailai County, Hebei Province, is a long, narrow vineyard of thousands of acres spanning five villages. It is backed by Flower Fruit Mountain and faces the Guanting Reservoir.
    In winter, the wind and sand are strong. The grapevines are buried in the sandy soil, hibernating for the winter. In spring, the grapevines are unearthed, and trellises are erected. By summer, the land is covered with green leaves, and a hundred flowers bloom. The air is filled with fragrance, lingering all day long. In autumn, various fruits ripen, and basket after basket are sold to Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, with the "Shaying Grapes" from Shaying Village being the most famous.
    This township, in this winter, has been filled with drive, determined to make a great leap forward. The planned output of fruits and grapes will leap from 1.2 million jin last year to 1.88 million jin, and 860 mu of new orchards will be developed. Moreover, because this was a grain-deficient township in the past, this year it will strive for grain self-sufficiency and even have a surplus.
    I didn’t stay long in this township, but I have already seen many exciting things that make my heart itch, wanting to sing out loud. Just as the county party committee issued a call from a telephone conference to promote street poetry, I began to try writing a few poems and took a few pieces of chalk to the streets—suddenly, the entire township unfolded before me its countless white walls, like countless poetry collections or countless issues of poetry journals unfolded its pages. This made people both happy and surprised. Happy that poetry has gained a new place for publication, its length is abundant, and it is not limited by printing sheets. And its readers are right in front of you, and the critics are also right in front of you, which inevitably makes people a little alarmed.
    Nuanquan Ballad
    Nuanquan is good,
    Rice is planted on the river滩,
    Grapes are trellised on the slopes,
    Pear trees and big red dates,
    Sand pears and crabapples,
    And all kinds of peaches.
    Nuanquan is warm,
    Facing the water in front,
    A land of rice and grain,
    Backed by mountains,
    Flower Fruit Mountain,
    Although life has improved,
    Not complacent,
    Speaking of it, it's still not as good as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai.
    Nuanquan is clear,
    Let's work harder,
    Cross the Great Wall,
    Strive to cross the Yellow River this year,
    A yield of four hundred jin per mu,
    Next year and the year after, go to Jiangnan,
    A great leap forward in the vineyard.
    Grape Xiaoling
    Emerges from the soil during Qingming,
    Sprouts during Guyu,
    Leaves appear during Lixia,
    Flowers bloom during Xiaoman.
    Harvest the fruit during Hanlu,
    The fruit is named "Autumn Purple,"
    Purple-red in color,
    The juice of wine.
    Famous throughout the country,
    Shaying grapes,
    Prune diligently,
    Bury the vines during Shuangjiang.
    Exquisite technique,
    Long-standing reputation,
    Even more innovation,
    Seeking further advancement.
    Conquering Nature
    The four pests must be eradicated,
    Weeds must be removed by the roots,
    A general mobilization throughout the township,
    Clean and hygienic.
    Also spray tree medicine,
    To eliminate pests and diseases,
    Tiger moths and caterpillars,
    Eat the grape leaves,
    Hateful felt disease,
    Weaving felt on the leaves,
    Oriental beetles,
    Love the tender buds the most,
    Red-necked longhorn beetles,
    Harm the roots and trunks,
    Quickly take out the sprayer,
    To eliminate these pests and diseases.
    Magpies, magpies are fierce birds,
    Love to eat white grapes,
    Snipers, aim quickly,
    Don't spare them.
    Also prevent natural disasters,
    Wind disasters and hail disasters,
    Fill with windbreaks,
    Transform the microclimate,
    Accept new technologies,
    Never be conservative,
    Improve management,
    Conquer nature.

    写在暖泉乡
    徐迟
    河北省怀来县的暖泉乡，全乡五个村是一个长形的成千顷的大葡萄园。背靠花果山，面临官厅水库。
    冬天，风沙大。葡萄条埋在沙土里，越冬休眠。春天，葡萄条出土了，支起棚架。到夏季，大地被绿叶覆盖，百花齐放。空气中洋溢着芳香，终日不散。秋天，各种水果下来了，一筐筐的销售到北京、天津和上海，其中以沙营村所出的“沙营葡萄”最为有名。
    这个乡，在今年的冬天里，鼓起了干劲，决心向前大大的跃进。水果葡萄的产量，计划从去年的一百二十万斤跃进到一百八十八万斤，外加要新发展八百六十亩果园。更因为这过去是个缺粮乡，今年要争取粮食自给而且有余。
    在这个乡里，我呆的时候不长，却已看到许多激动人心的事情，令人心头痒痒的，想放声歌唱。恰好县委从电话会议中发出了号召，要提倡街头诗，就开始试作了几首，并且拿了几枝粉笔，走上街头——突然，整个乡在我面前展开了它无数面雪白的墙壁，如同无数本诗集或无数期诗刊展开了它的篇页。这使人又喜又惊。喜的是诗歌得到了一个新的发表场所，它的篇幅很丰富，不受印张的限制。而它的读者就近在眼前，批评家也近在眼前，这一点则不免又使人有点儿惊惶了。
    暖泉谣暖泉好，河滩种水稻，坡上架葡萄，梨树大红枣，沙果和海棠，还有各种桃。暖泉暖，前靠水，米粮川，后靠山，花果山，生活虽改善，不自满，说起来还比不上北京天津和上海。暖泉清，加把劲，过长城，争取今年过黄河，亩产四百斤，明年后年下江南，葡萄园里大跃进。
    葡萄小令清明出土，谷雨出芽，立夏出叶，小满开花。寒露收果，果名“秋紫”，紫红颜色，酒浆之汁。名满全国，沙营葡萄，勤加修剪，霜降埋条。技术之精，夙有名声，更要革新，益求先进。
    战胜大自然四害要除尽，斩草要除根，全乡总动员，清洁而卫生。还要打树药，扑灭病虫害，虎蛾毛毛虫，吃的葡萄叶，可恨毛毯病，叶上织毛毯，东方金龟子，嫩芽它最爱，红颈小天牛，危害根和干，赶快取出喷雾器，扑灭这些病虫害。喜鹊喜鹊是凶鸟，爱吃白葡萄，射手快瞄准，对它不能饶。还要防天灾，风灾和雹灾，布满防风林，改造小气候，接受新技术，千万不保守，管理要改善，战胜大自然。
