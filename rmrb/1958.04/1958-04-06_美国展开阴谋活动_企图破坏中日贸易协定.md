Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 5th: In addition to supporting the Chiang Kai-shek clique in its outcry of opposition, the U.S. authorities are directly involved in a conspiracy to sabotage the recently signed Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson held a secret meeting with Japanese Ambassador to the United States Koichiro Asakai on April 1st regarding the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, particularly the provision in the agreement concerning the right of Chinese commercial representative offices to fly their national flag. He attempted to exert pressure on the Japanese government, urging it to maintain a position of undermining the agreement.

At the same time, a group of U.S. congressmen hostile to the Chinese people are engaging in activities in the U.S. Congress, attempting to obstruct the implementation of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement through open interference. Senator Bridges, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, instructed on April 4th that the contents of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement be published in the Congressional Record distributed to members of Congress, and maliciously attacked the agreement as "increasing China's military strength." Bridges also urged the Senate to pay attention to a statement issued by an organization composed of a group of politicians who are extremely hostile to the New China, called the "Million Committee." This statement shamelessly attacked the Sino-Japanese trade agreement as a "threat to the free world" and openly put pressure on Japan, demanding that it "reconsider" the agreement.

Senator Knowland, a notorious supporter of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and spokesperson for the "Million Committee," said in a statement on April 2nd that Senators Smith, Douglas, and Representative Walter, along with himself, opposed the Sino-Japanese trade agreement. Knowland openly demanded that the Japanese government not ratify the trade agreement.

    美国展开阴谋活动
    企图破坏中日贸易协定
    新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国当局除支持蒋介石集团出面叫嚷反对以外，正在直接参与破坏最近签订的第四次中日贸易协定的阴谋。
    美国负责远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊1日同日本驻美大使潮海浩一郎秘密会谈中日贸易协定问题，特别是协定中规定的关于中国商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗的问题，企图对日本政府施行压力，要它坚持破坏这个协定的立场。
    同时，一批敌视中国人民的美国议员在美国国会中展开活动，企图用公开干涉的手段来阻挠中日贸易协定的实现。美国共和党政策委员会主席、参议员布里奇斯4日指使把中日贸易协定内容刊载在散发给议员们的国会纪录中，并且恶意攻击这个协定“增加了中国的军事实力”。布里奇斯还要求参议院注意由一批极端仇视新中国的政客拼凑成的、名字叫作“百万人委员会”的机构所发表的声明，这个声明无耻地攻击中日贸易协定是“对自由世界的威胁”，并且公开对日本施加压力，要它“重新考虑”这个协定。
    “百万人委员会”的发言人、支持蒋介石集团的声名狼籍的参议员周以德2日发表谈话说，参议员史密斯、道格拉斯和众议员华尔特和他自己都反对中日贸易协定。周以德公开要求日本政府不要批准这个贸易协定。
