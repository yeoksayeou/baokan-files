Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 27th: In the residential area of the Xiawutun Agricultural Cooperative in Xingyi County, Guizhou Province, more than ten new two-story buildings have recently appeared. These houses have brick walls, tiled roofs, and whitewashed interiors, making them economical, practical, generous and beautiful. This is the preliminary achievement of Xiawutun Agricultural Cooperative in the unified planning and construction of new housing for its members. The cooperative has decided to continue building 380 new houses for its members, totaling 1,520 rooms, this year. In order to complete this plan, starting from mid-February, 200 carpenters, masons, and stonemasons were drawn from the cooperative members to form a construction team to build new houses for the members.

At the beginning of this year, the Xiawutun Agricultural Cooperative, based on full discussion and consultation among its members, formulated a plan to build a new socialist countryside. This plan requires that in the next few years, the more than fifty natural villages in the cooperative be gradually merged into twenty-seven villages; the small and dilapidated thatched cottages will be gradually eliminated, so that the members can all live in new houses.

After repeated discussions, the members unanimously agreed that unified planning and construction of new housing for cooperative members has five advantages: (1) Saving a large amount of timber. Building houses in a scattered manner requires about one hundred trees per household, and at least eighty trees; according to the plan, jointly built houses (saving one wall for two households and two walls for three households) require only thirty trees per household. (2) Saving farmland, the cooperative can free up about 300 mu of fertile land. (3) Avoiding the phenomenon of members being delayed from work due to building houses. (4) Opening up avenues for sideline production such as bricks, tiles, lime, masonry, carpentry, and stonemasonry within the cooperative. (5) Neat, beautiful, and satisfying to the members; and to a certain extent, solving the problem of funding for some poor peasants to build houses.

After implementing this plan, the members were all delighted and supported it with practical actions. In just a few days, more than 1,400 households in the cooperative contributed nearly 10,000 trees to the cooperative at a discount, which can be used to build more than 380 houses; and more than 300 pieces of wood boards were contributed at a discount.

    不住茅草屋　集体建新房
    下午屯农民兴修简易楼房经济适用
    据新华社贵阳27日电　贵州省兴义县下午屯农业社的社员住区里，最近出现了十多幢两层新式楼房。这些住房都是砖砌墙、瓦盖顶、里面石灰粉刷，既经济适用，又大方美观。这是下午屯农业社统筹安排新建社员住房的初步成绩。这个社决定在今年内继续新建社员住房三百八十幢，共一千五百二十间。为了完成这个计划，从2月中旬起就在社员中抽调木匠、泥水匠和石匠二百人，组成了兴建社员新住房的建筑大队。
    今年初，下午屯农业社在社员充分讨论协商的基础上，制订了建成新农村的规划。这个规划要求，在今后几年内，把全社五十多个自然村寨逐步合并为二十七个村寨；逐步消灭矮小破烂的茅草房，使社员都住进新房。
    社员们经过反复讨论后，一致认为全社统筹安排建筑社员新住房有五项好处：（1）节约大量木材。零星建筑住房，一户约需木材百多棵，少的也需八十棵；按规划联合建筑成幢的住房（二户省一壁，三户省二壁），每户仅需三十棵木材。（2）节约田地，全社约可腾出三百亩良田。（3）避免了社员因建筑住房而误工的现象。（4）为社内砖瓦、石灰、泥水、木、石匠等副业生产开辟了道路。（5）整洁美观，社员满意；并在一定程度上解决了部分贫农建筑住房资金的困难。
    执行这个规划后，社员们都欢欣鼓舞，并用实际行动进行支援。只在几天内，全社一千四百多户社员就折价入社近万棵木材，可供修建住房三百八十多幢；折价入社的木板达三百多块。
