The 18th article of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) proposes: "Develop forestry and green all possible barren and mountainous areas." This is a struggle goal of transforming nature put forward by our party based on the needs of socialist industrial and agricultural construction and the people.

A Kind of "Automated Factory"

As everyone knows, humans and all animals rely on green plants to live. Grown trees, like automated factories, can absorb solar radiation energy and convert water and inorganic salts in the soil and carbon dioxide in the air into carbohydrates, fats, proteins, plant alkaloids, lipids, etc., and decompose oxygen that can freshen the air. The most important thing in the synthesis of these products is the synthesis of carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates are very precious things, and many raw materials needed for production and life, such as starch, sugars, fiber, wood, fats, organic acids, alcohol, etc., are nothing more than different forms of carbohydrates and their derivatives. As long as the temperature is suitable, and there is a certain amount of rain, sunshine, and air, the land has the basic conditions for trees to manufacture carbohydrates; of course, the soil with certain chemical composition and physical properties must also be available. However, soil is produced by rock weathering and biological action; tree roots absorb inorganic salts from the soil and return most of the nutrients to the soil in the form of fallen branches and leaves. In this process, trees can also absorb nutrients from the depths of the soil, and even from weathered rock layers, enriching the nutrients in the upper layer of the soil. The drilling of tree roots and the increase of organic matter also improve the physical properties of the soil and increase the soil's aggregate structure. Because the temperature change in the forest is small, the water condition is relatively stable, the soil is loose, and the organic matter is rich, soil organisms and microorganisms are also particularly vigorous; the vigorousness of soil organisms and microorganisms makes the soil more fertile. In addition, the forest can also change soil moisture conditions and microclimate conditions, making them more conducive to the growth of trees.

Can Provide a Variety of Forest Products

Wood is an important building raw material second only to steel. Some people believe that after industrial development, the demand for wood will decrease, and there will be many substitutes. In fact, the more developed the economy, the more wood is needed.

It is estimated that China's demand for logs will reach 47 million cubic meters in 1962, and will increase to 166.1 million cubic meters by 1977. This is still a very low estimate, much lower than the existing level of the Soviet Union and other industrialized countries.

Wood has many advantages: heat insulation, sound insulation, elasticity, non-conductivity, beauty, etc. Many of its uses cannot be replaced by metal products, synthetic products or other products. For example, railway sleepers, mine pillars, floors, furniture, etc., wood products have special advantages. With the development of industry, new wood products will be continuously discovered and developed, such as rayon, artificial wool, plywood, laminated wood, etc. Among them, the production of wood pulp will increase particularly quickly.

China also has many other forest products, some of which are important industrial raw materials, such as tung oil, paint, rubber, rosin, tannin, cork, charcoal, etc.; some are people's living materials such as oil, fruits, beverages, medicinal materials, spices, firewood, etc. Many of these things are important export materials. In addition, in the forest, you can also breed and raise various precious fur animals, such as sable, lynx, deer, musk, etc., and produce many medicinal materials.

Wood and forest products are not only commodities themselves, directly increasing the income of farmers, especially mountain farmers, but also raw materials for handicrafts and processing and manufacturing industries, so the development of forestry production can indirectly promote industrial production in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. Some trees can also be used as fertilizers or feed, which has a direct promoting effect on agricultural production increase and the development of animal husbandry.

Can Guarantee Agricultural Production

Forests can regulate water sources. This has been recorded in detail in China very early. In the early 19th century, Mei Zengliang of the Qing Dynasty vividly described the soil erosion caused by indiscriminate reclamation and destruction of forests based on the personal experience of the masses:

"...The uncultivated mountains have firm soil and solid rocks, dense grass and trees, and decaying leaves accumulate for several years, up to two or three inches; every day rain falls from the trees to the leaves, from the leaves to the soil and rocks, through the crevices of the rocks, dripping into springs, and the water below is slow; moreover, the water goes down and the soil does not follow it; because the water is slow, the lower fields can receive it without disaster. And if it does not rain for half a month, the higher fields will still be irrigated. Now, if the mountains are barren with axes and the soil is loosened with hoes and plows, the sand and rocks will fall down with one rain, rushing and pouring into the gullies, and the streams will be filled and the weirs cannot store water, until it stops in the low-lying fields. And when the low-lying fields are exhausted, the water from the mountain fields will have no successor. This is to open up barren land and harm the fields in the valleys..."

The reason why forests can regulate water sources and prevent soil erosion is due to the following factors: First, the branches and leaves of trees can intercept some rainwater; the amount of interception varies with tree species, growth potential, age, season, and the nature of rainfall. Generally, the canopy can intercept 0.5 to 2.5 mm of rainfall per rainfall. Second, forest soil is rich in organic matter, has a good aggregate structure, loose texture, and many gaps and pores, so rainwater can easily penetrate into the soil; forest soil also contains a large amount of rainwater. Third, the forest land surface has a layer of fallen branches and leaves and a humus layer, which can absorb a large amount of rainwater and protect the surface soil particles from being impacted and dispersed by raindrops, blocking the pores of the soil surface, so that rainwater cannot penetrate. Fourth, due to the obstruction of the fallen branches and leaves and the surface roots of the forest, the surface rainwater flows slowly, increasing the chance of rainwater penetrating into the soil. Fifth, because the forest land has a layer of fallen branches and leaves covering the ground, and there are more large gaps in the forest soil, the degree of winter freezing is light, and even if it freezes, it still maintains gaps and a loose state; therefore, when the spring snow melts, the snow water can penetrate into the soil and not form runoff.

In addition, forest soil contains a lot of organic matter, which is not easily eroded, and the roots of trees and understory plants can gather soil particles, and the layer of fallen branches and leaves can also filter the mud and sand carried by the runoff.

According to observations, after the forest is destroyed, the amount of ground cover and soil carried away by runoff in the rainy season is ten to six thousand times more than before the forest was destroyed.

Soil erosion not only reduces the soil in the erosion area, loses nutrients, forms many gullies, and even becomes a stone mountain. More seriously, the downstream of the river is silted up, especially the reservoirs lose their function due to siltation (irrigation and power generation). There is no strong wind in the forest, which everyone knows. Shelterbelts can reduce the wind speed near the ground. Wind is a flowing air current, which is blocked by the trunks and branches of trees through the forest belt, increasing friction, and the wind speed is reduced. Under the protection of the forest belt, the humid air layer on the ground can be retained, and the air humidity is high, which is more significant in arid areas. For these reasons, crops can avoid or reduce the damage caused by wind; soil fertilizer will not be blown away, and water conditions can also be improved. This helps to increase and stabilize agricultural output.

Planting trees on the edges of irrigation canals can strengthen the embankments and reduce the evaporation of canal water. At the same time, the forest belt can also lower the groundwater level along the canal, weaken the rise of capillary water, and prevent soil alkalization.

The occurrence of wind and sand is necessarily due to bare, dry, and windy soil surfaces. Therefore, if there is a forest, the ground is not bare, or because the forest keeps the ground moist, there will be no flying sand and dust in general. Because the forest belt can reduce wind speed, it can also reduce wind and sand.

To fix shifting sand and eliminate wind and sand disasters, planting trees is the fundamental solution. Planting trees can also increase the organic matter in the sandy soil, improve the sandy soil, and make it a good agricultural and pastoral production base.

Can Beautify the Living Environment

Trees have the functions of absorbing dust, sound insulation, preventing storms, and shading strong sunlight; in addition, trees can also secrete a gas that can kill bacteria, which has a disinfecting effect on the air. Therefore, the forest environment is suitable for living, recreation, and recuperation is scientifically based.

Forests have high aesthetic value. It is inconceivable that barren mountains and wastelands without trees can become scenic spots. Forests are vibrant and ever-changing pictures. Green pines and cypresses, towering ancient trees, lush bamboo forests, and brocades of flowers, the tender green of new branches, and the crimson of frost leaves can all make people feel open-minded and invigorated. Various birds, animals and microorganisms are hidden in the forest. The forest is static in movement, and complex in unity and coordination.

Regional Conditions Should Be Considered

To make afforestation work faster, better, and more economically, we must first consider what kind of trees are most suitable to plant.

The selection of tree species must be based on the purpose of greening and must be suitable for local climate and soil conditions. From a national perspective, the southern mountainous areas should generally focus on planting timber tree species and special economic tree species—oil and industrial raw materials. The northern barren mountains should focus on tree species that have strong soil and water conservation effects and are drought-resistant; the tree species for farmland shelterbelts should be tall, strong in wind resistance, but not too shady, too widely rooted, and do not spread crop diseases and insect pests. Sand-fixing afforestation should use tree species with extensive root systems, strong root sprouting ability, and drought resistance and sand burial tolerance. In low mountains and plains with good soil conditions, trees should be planted on the sides of villages and houses, and tree species with fast growth and high economic value should be selected. In urban and industrial and mining areas, tree species with strong smoke resistance, neat tree shape, and wide shade should be selected. In addition, the greening tree species should be fast-growing, have few diseases and insect pests, have strong resistance to natural disasters, have abundant seed sources, easy seed collection and seedling cultivation or cutting propagation, and easy to survive.

    栽树有哪些好处
    林业科学研究所森林地理研究室主任　吴中伦
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）第十八条提出：“发展林业，绿化一切可能绿化的荒地荒山”。这是我们党根据社会主义工农业建设和人民的需要提出的一个改造自然的斗争目标。
    一种“自动化工厂”
    大家知道，人类和一切动物都是依靠绿色植物才能生活的。长成的树木，就像自动化的工厂一样，能够吸收太阳辐射能，把土壤中的水分、无机盐分和空气中的二氧化炭，制造成炭水化合物、脂肪、蛋白质、植物碱、脂液等等，并且分解出可以使空气新鲜的氧。在这些产品的合成过程中，最重要的就是炭水化合物的合成。
    炭水化合物是十分宝贵的东西，生产上和生活上所需要的很多原料如淀粉、糖类、纤维、木材、脂肪、有机酸、酒精等等，无非是不同形式的炭水化合物和它的衍生物。凡是温度适宜，有一定雨水、阳光、空气的土地上就具备了树木制造炭水化合物的基本条件；当然还必须具备一定化学成分和物理性状的土壤。但是土壤是岩石风化和生物作用而产生的；树木根部从土壤中吸取无机盐分，又以枯枝落叶形式把大部分养分送入土中。在这个过程中。树木还能够吸取土层深处，甚至风化岩层中的养分，丰富土壤上层的养分。树根的钻孔和有机物的增加，又改进了土壤的物理性，增加了土壤的团粒结构。由于森林中温度变化小，水分条件比较稳定，土质疏松，有机质丰富，土壤生物和微生物也格外旺盛；土壤生物和微生物的旺盛，又使土壤更加肥沃。此外，森林还能够改变土壤水分条件和小气候条件，使它们更有利于树木的生长。
    可以提供多种林产品
    木材是仅次于钢材的重要建筑原材料。有人认为工业发达以后，木材需要就会减少，就会有许多代用品。实际上，经济愈发展，木材需要愈多。
    据估计，我国1962年原木需要将达到四千七百万立方公尺，到1977年将增加到一万六千六百一十万立方公尺。这还是一个很低的估计，比起苏联和其他工业发达国家的现有水准还低得多。
    木材有许多优点：隔热、隔音、有弹性、不导电、美观等等。它的许多用途往往不是金属制品、合成品或者其他制品所能代替的。如铁道枕木、矿柱、地板、家具等等，木制品有特殊的优点。随着工业的发达，新的木材产品将不断地发现和发展，如人造纤维、人造羊毛、胶合板、层叠材等等。这当中木浆的生产将特别增加得快。
    我国还有很多其他林产品，其中有的是重要的工业原料，如桐油、漆、橡胶、松脂、单宁、木栓、木炭等等；有的是人民生活资料如油料、果品、饮料、药材、香料、薪炭等等。上述这些东西许多是重要的出口物资。此外在森林内，还可以繁殖和饲养各种珍贵皮毛兽，如貂、猞猁、鹿、麝等等，以及生产许多药材。
    木材和林产品不但本身是商品，直接增加农民特别是山区农民的收入，而且也是手工业和加工制造业的原料，所以发展林业生产间接可以促进山区和半山区的工业生产。有些树木还可以作为肥料或者饲料，对农业增产和发展牧业有直接推动作用。
    可以保障农业生产
    森林可以调节水源。这在中国很早就有详细记载。在十九世纪初期清代的梅曾亮曾经根据群众切身的体会，对滥垦和破坏森林而引起水土冲刷作了生动的描述：
    “……未开（垦）之山，土坚石固，草树茂密，腐叶积数年，可二三寸；每天雨从树至叶，从叶至土石，历石罅，滴沥成泉，其下水也缓；又水下而土不随其下；水缓，故低田受之不为灾。而半月不雨，高田尤受其浸溉。今以斤斧童其山，而以锄犁疏其土，一雨未毕，砂石随下，奔流注壑，涧中皆填圩不可贮水，毕至洼田中乃止。及洼田竭，而山田之水无继者。是为开不毛之地，而病有谷之田……。”
    森林之所以能调节水源，防止土壤侵蚀，是由于下列几个因素：第一，树木的枝叶可以截留一些雨水；截留数量则随树种、生长势、年龄、季节、降雨性质而异。一般，每次降雨，树冠可以截留零点五到二点五公厘的雨量。第二，森林土壤有机质丰富，团粒结构良好，质地疏松，多空隙和孔道，雨水容易渗入土中；森林土壤含蓄雨水量也大。第三，林地表面有枯枝落叶层和腐殖质层，既能大量吸收雨水，又能保护表面土粒，免受雨点冲击分散堵塞土面孔隙，以致雨水不能渗透。第四，由于枯枝落叶层和地表树根的阻挡，使地面雨水流动缓慢，增加雨水渗入土中的机会。第五，由于林地有枯枝落叶层被复，和森林土壤大空隙较多，冬季冰冻程度轻，即使结冰仍然保持空隙和疏松状态；因此当春雪融化的时候，雪水可以渗入土中，不致形成径流。
    此外，森林土壤含有机质多，不容易被侵蚀，树木和林下植物的根系能够笼络土粒，枯枝落叶层还能够对径流挟带的泥砂起过滤作用。
    根据观察，森林毁坏后，在雨季地面复被物和泥土被径流挟带流失的数量，比森林破坏前增加十倍到六千倍。
    土壤侵蚀不但使冲刷区土壤减少，养分流失，形成许多沟壑，甚至成为石山。更严重的还使河流下游受到淤塞，特别是水库因为淤积而失去作用（灌溉和发电）。森林里没有大风，这是谁都知道的。防护林带，能够降低接近地面层的风速。风是流动的气流，它通过林带受到林木干枝的拦阻，增加磨擦，风速就降低。在林带保护下地面潮润的空气层能够滞留，空气湿度较高，这在干燥地区更为显著。由于这些原因，农作物就可以避免或者减轻被风吹袭的损害；土壤肥料不会被吹失，水分条件也可以改进。这就有助于农业产量的增加和稳定。
    在灌溉渠道边种树，一则可以加固堤岸，可以降低渠水蒸发，同时林带还可以使渠边地下水位降低，削弱毛细管水的上升，防止土壤碱化。
    风砂的发生，必然是土面裸露，干燥，风力强。因此，如果有森林，地面不裸露，或者因为有森林地面保持湿润，在一般情况下就不会有飞砂扬尘的现象。由于林带可以降低风速，从而也就可以减轻风砂。
    要固定流砂，杜绝风砂灾害，植树就是根本办法。植树还能增加砂土的有机质，改良砂土，使成为良好的农牧生产基地。
    可以美化生活环境
    树木有吸尘、隔音、防御风暴、遮盖强烈阳光的作用；此外，树木还能分泌出一种能够杀灭细菌的气体，对空气有消毒作用。因此，森林环境适合生活、游息、疗养是有科学依据的。
    森林具有高度的美观价值。不能设想，没有树林的荒山荒地能够成为风景区。森林生气勃勃，又是千变万化的图景。苍松翠柏，古木参天，茂林修竹，繁花如锦，新枝的嫩绿，霜叶的绯红，都能使人胸怀开旷，精神振奋。森林中藏着各种鸟兽动物和微生物。森林是寓动于静，寓错综复杂于统一协调之中。
    应当考虑地区条件
    要把造林工作做到多快好省，首先要考虑栽什么树最合适。
    选择树种既要根据绿化的目的，又必须适合当地的气候条件和土壤条件。从全国范围来说，南方山区一般应该着重种用材树种和特用经济树种——油料和工业原料等。北方荒山应该着重水土保持作用强而又能抗旱的树种；农田防护林带的树种要树形高大，抗风力强而又不是遮荫过大，窜根过广和有传播农作物病虫害的树种。固砂造林要用根系广，根蘖萌发力强，同时又有抗旱，耐沙埋掩的树种。在土质条件良好的低山和平原地区四旁植树应该选择生长快和经济价值高的树种。在城市和工矿地区要选择抗烟能力强，树形整齐，遮荫广的树种。此外绿化树种都应该是生长快、病虫害少，抵抗自然灾害能力强，种子来源丰富，采种育苗或者插条繁殖容易和容易种活的树种。
