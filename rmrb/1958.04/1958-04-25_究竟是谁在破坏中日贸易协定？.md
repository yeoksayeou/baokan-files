    Who Exactly is Undermining the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement?

    The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government's reply on April 9 to the three Japanese organizations responsible for signing trade agreements with China effectively overturned the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the memorandum that was an inseparable part of the agreement. Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, has already sternly pointed out in his reply to the three Japanese organizations that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government deliberately undermined the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and stated that the agreement could not be implemented until the obstacles set up by the Japanese government were removed. It is now clear that the Kishi Nobusuke government should bear full responsibility for undermining the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Japanese people, many mass organizations, and progressive individuals who are concerned about Sino-Japanese trade have been holding the Japanese government accountable and demanding that the Japanese government change its attitude. However, the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government and even some major Japanese newspapers are spreading such rumors as "China's attitude is excessive," and even saying that "China's response has become an obstacle to the implementation of the Fourth Agreement," attempting to shift the responsibility for undermining the agreement to the Chinese side. Therefore, it is essential to further clarify the facts.

    Who exactly is undermining the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement? First and foremost, one must look at the facts. The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement included some unresolved issues from the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. In order to smoothly resolve these issues, such as commercial arbitration, the mutual establishment of permanent private commercial representative offices, and the mutual holding of commodity exhibitions in each other's countries, both parties needed to obtain the consent of their respective governments, provide safety guarantees for each other's personnel, and facilitate their work. These provisions are clearly stipulated in the text of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the memorandum. After the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, not only did Chinese public opinion express a warm welcome, but Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi also explicitly expressed his support when he met with Yamamoto Kumaichi, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and Nango Saburo, Chairman of the Japan-China Export-Import Association, on March 7. In February and April of this year, Japanese commodity exhibitions were opened in Guangzhou and Wuhan, and Lei Renmin, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, twice rushed to the sites to offer congratulations. The Japanese flag was prominently displayed at the Japanese commodity exhibitions. Japanese commodity exhibition staff and trade representatives dispatched by Japanese manufacturers to China were also given full security guarantees and various conveniences for their work. These facts all demonstrate that the Chinese government actively supports the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

    But what was the attitude of the Japanese government? After the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, people from all walks of life in Japan generally welcomed it, but Kishi Nobusuke said on the same day at the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors that it would be "very difficult" for the Japanese government to recognize this agreement. Subsequently, after colluding with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique and consulting several times, the Kishi Nobusuke government delayed for more than a month before responding to the three Japanese organizations. This response not only failed to offer any clear guarantees, but instead put forward three preconditions that directly contradicted the spirit of the trade agreement, turning its so-called "support and assistance" for the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement into empty words. Aichi Kiichi, Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Japanese government, publicly stated that the Japanese government intended to ensure that the various provisions made by both parties on the basis of reciprocity in the agreement and the memorandum would not apply to the Chinese side, and also brazenly denied the Chinese commercial representative offices the right to display their national flag. As late as the 23rd of this month, Kishi Nobusuke continued his stubborn attitude and publicly declared that he "cannot recognize the right of Communist China's commercial representative offices to display the national flag." Is this not the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government rudely and unilaterally tearing up the agreement?

    All the clauses of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the memorandum had been fully agreed upon by both parties as early as last October. Only the Japanese side indicated that some issues concerning the mutual establishment of commercial representative offices needed to be discussed back in their country, which led to a temporary interruption of the negotiations. In February of this year, the Japanese trade delegation revisited Beijing and signed the agreement on the basis of the original agreement. According to common sense, this means that after returning to the country for discussion, the "obtaining the consent of the national government" should have been realized, and the entire agreement, including the memorandum, should no longer be a problem. However, after the signing of the agreement, the Kishi Nobusuke government overturned the clauses unanimously agreed upon by both parties. Can this kind of about-face be considered a minimum of international good faith?

    The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government has spread a smokescreen, saying that its position is to "separate trade from politics," while the Chinese side seems to intend to achieve some "political goals" through trade. This outrageous lie is not worth refuting.

    Trade between two countries is both an economic affair and a political affair. Smoothly resolving everything in trade exchanges, such as the aforementioned commercial arbitration, mutual establishment of commercial representative offices, and mutual holding of commodity exhibitions in each other's countries, inevitably involves political issues since it requires both governments to implement safety guarantees. This is necessary for promoting the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people and smoothly resolving the economic affairs between the two peoples. However, the "political issues" referred to by the Japanese government and some Japanese newspapers are intended to create the impression that the Fourth Agreement, and especially the mutual establishment of commercial representative offices, was imposed on Japan by China. In fact, the mutual establishment of permanent private commercial representative offices between China and Japan was originally proposed by Uda Kouichi, the Japanese representative, when the Second Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was signed. At that time, Ikeda Masanosuke, the head of the Japanese delegation, also expressed his approval, and the Chinese side agreed to the Japanese side's opinion after much consideration. This issue was recorded in the memorandum of the Second Sino-Japanese Trade Negotiations and was later included in the text of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. On the issue of mutually establishing permanent private commercial representative offices, the Chinese side has never raised any other conditions other than insisting that the safety and convenience of the other party's staff should be guaranteed on an equal basis. However, the Japanese government first used the fingerprint issue and then the issue of limiting the number of representative offices as pretexts, and later made a big fuss about the issue of hanging the national flag and the fabricated "privileges," trying to obstruct the realization of the issue of mutually establishing trade representative offices originally proposed by the Japanese side. Isn't this politics? Making "domestic law," "the fact of not recognizing the government," and "international relations" as preconditions, making the trade agreement impossible to implement, isn't this politics? It can be seen that it is not the Chinese side, but precisely the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government that is linking trade with politics.

    In the past, China and Japan have signed and implemented three trade agreements, none of which involved the mutual recognition of the two countries. The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement is still an agreement between non-governmental organizations on both sides, and it has nothing to do with this issue at all. In the past, when China held commodity exhibitions in Japan and Japan held commodity exhibitions in China, they all displayed their national flags without any issue of mutual recognition or not. The fact that China and Japan have not yet restored normal diplomatic relations is entirely the result of the Japanese government's hostile policy towards China following the United States. This situation is certainly not in line with the desire of the Chinese and Japanese people for friendship and the early restoration of diplomatic relations. However, as long as the Japanese government remains under the control of the United States and continues to maintain its so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, it will be impossible for China and Japan to restore formal diplomatic relations. Despite this, the Chinese side still actively assists non-governmental organizations in both countries to carry out friendly activities between the Chinese and Japanese people, sign trade agreements, and develop trade between the two countries. After the signing of this agreement, the Kishi Nobusuke government made a big fuss about the flag issue and repeatedly sang the tune of not recognizing China. What does this mean? There can only be one explanation: it is using "domestic law" as an excuse to undermine the principle of equality between the two sides, using "non-recognition" and "international relations" as an excuse to try to force Sino-Japanese trade relations to submit to Japanese-American and Japanese-Chiang relations, thereby pleasing the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

    Ikeda Masanosuke, the chief representative of the Japanese side responsible for signing the trade agreement with China, has another explanation: the Japanese government is not preventing Chinese commercial representative offices from hanging the national flag, but simply "does not recognize" this "right." And he said that the Chinese side has a "misunderstanding" about this. We have no misunderstanding at all. Since you do not recognize the "right," what guarantee is there? Hasn't the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department already revealed that if "zealots" attack the Chinese flag, they will not be prosecuted? As for Kishi Nobusuke's absurd remarks that the Chinese flag is regarded as private property, it is a great insult to the Chinese people. May I ask, if the Chinese people do not regard the Japanese flag as a symbol representing the Japanese state, but only as private property, what would the Japanese people think?

    The Kishi Nobusuke government has also maliciously spread some rumors that China has demanded "diplomatic privileges" from Japan. Recently, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Justice even falsely accused that Chinese non-governmental commercial representative offices would set up secret radio stations once sent to Japan. The essence of these lies is to spread an atmosphere of distrust of New China among the Japanese people and undermine the increasingly enhanced friendship between the two peoples in recent years.

    The Kishi Nobusuke government has played a series of political tricks, deliberately undermining the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, but counter-accuses the Chinese side of having some "political purpose." How can this cover the eyes and ears of the world? If the Chinese side has any "political purpose," it is to enhance the friendship between the two peoples while developing trade between the two countries. This "purpose" is clearly stated in the trade agreement and is also approved by the Japanese people. Isn't it "reasonable" if you don't do this, but like the Japanese government, on the one hand, adopt a blatant hostile attitude towards China, and on the other hand, want to get a piece of the pie from Sino-Japanese trade?

    China's starting point for signing trade agreements with Japan is to develop trade between the two countries based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. China's claims have always been in line with the spirit of the agreement and the memorandum. The current problem lies entirely in whether the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government will abandon its hostile attitude towards the Chinese people and unconditionally guarantee the implementation of the various provisions of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. How can China's adherence to the principles unanimously agreed upon by both parties be considered an "excessive" act? Is it necessary for the Chinese side to agree to subordinate Sino-Japanese trade relations to Japanese-American and Japanese-Chiang relations to be considered not "excessive"? But the Chinese people will never compromise on this issue.

    We are still optimistic about the trade prospects between the Chinese and Japanese people. Although there are obstacles at present, the Chinese and Japanese people have overcome many difficulties in the past in order to develop trade between the two countries and the friendly relations between the two peoples. In the future, they will certainly clear the dark clouds temporarily covering their heads and see the sunny day.

### 究竟是谁在破坏中日贸易协定？

    究竟是谁在破坏中日贸易协定？
    日本岸信介政府4月9日对负责同中国签订贸易协定的日本三团体的答复，实际上推翻了第四次中日贸易协定和作为协定不可分割的一部分的备忘录。中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸在给日本三团体的复电中，已经严正地指出了日本岸信介政府蓄意破坏第四次中日贸易协定的事实，表示在日本政府设置的障碍没有扫除以前，这个协定是无法实施的。事情已经很明显，岸信介政府应当担负破坏中日贸易协定的全部责任。关心中日贸易的日本人民、许多群众团体和进步人士，纷纷向日本政府追究责任，要求日本政府改变态度。但是，日本岸信介政府以至日本的若干大报，却在散布“中国的态度过火了”，甚至说“中国方面的回答，成为第四次协定实施的障碍”等等谰言，企图把破坏协定的责任推卸给中国方面。因之，进一步来澄清是非，是十分必要的。
    到底谁在破坏中日贸易协定？首先不能不看事实。第四次中日贸易协定中包括了第三次中日贸易协定中一些悬而未决的事项。为了顺利解决这些问题，例如有关商事仲裁问题、互设常驻民间商务代表机构问题、互在对方国家举办商品展览会问题等等，都需要双方各自取得本国政府的同意，给予对方工作人员以安全保证和进行工作的方便。这在第四次中日贸易协定本文和备忘录里都有明文规定。第四次中日贸易协定签订以后，中国方面不仅舆论界表示热烈欢迎，陈毅副总理兼外交部长在3月7日接见日本国际贸易促进协会会长山本熊一和日本日中输出入组合理事长南乡三郎时，也明确表示了支持的态度。今年2月和4月，日本商品展览会先后在我国广州和武汉开幕，中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民两次都曾赶往现地祝贺。日本商品展览会上高悬着日本国旗。日本商品展览会工作人员和日本厂商派驻中国的贸易代表也得到了充分的安全保证和种种进行工作的方便。这些事实都说明中国政府是积极支持第四次中日贸易协定的。
    但日本政府的态度如何呢？第四次中日贸易协定签订之后，日本各界人士普遍表示欢迎，而岸信介当天却在参议院预算委员会上说，日本政府要承认这个协定是“非常困难”的。其后，岸信介政府在同美国和蒋介石集团勾勾搭搭、几经商量之后，拖延了一个多月才对日本三团体作了答复。这个答复不但没有提出任何明确的保证，相反地却提出了三个直接同贸易协定精神相违背的前提，使它所说的对第四次中日贸易协定的“支持和协助”变成一句骗人的空话。日本政府内阁官房长官爱知揆一的谈话，更公然表明了日本政府企图使双方根据对等原则在协定和备忘录里作出的各项规定不适用于中国方面，同时还悍然否认了中国商务代表机构悬挂本国国旗的权利。直到本月23日，岸信介依然继续其顽固态度，公开声称“不能承认共产党中国商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗”。这不是日本岸信介政府粗暴地片面撕毁协定又是什么？
    第四次中日贸易协定和备忘录的各项条款，早在去年10月，双方就已完全达成协议，只是日本方面表示关于互设商务代表机构的某些问题，还要回国进行商讨，因而谈判才一度宣告中断。今年2月，日本访华通商使节团重来北京，在原来达成协议的基础上签订了协定，按常理说，这就意味着经过回国商讨以后，“取得本国政府同意”之事应已实现，对整个协定包括备忘录应已不成问题了。而在协定签订之后，岸信介政府却又推翻了双方一致同意的条款，这种出乎尔反乎尔的作法，还谈得上起码的国际信义吗？
    日本岸信介政府散布了一种烟幕，说它的立场是要把“贸易和政治分开”，而中国方面似乎有意通过贸易来达到什么“政治目的”。这种弥天大谎是不值得一驳的。
    两国间的贸易，又是经济事务。又是政治事务。要顺利解决贸易往来当中的一切事情，如上述的商事仲裁、互设商务代表机构、互在对方国家举办商品展览会等问题，既然需要双方政府实行安全保证，就必然牵涉到政治问题。这是促进中日两国人民的友好和顺利解决两国人民间的经济事务所必需的。但是日本政府和某些日本报刊所指的“政治问题”，它的含义却是企图造成这么一种印象，即第四次协定和尤其是有关互设商务代表机构，是中国强加于日本的。其实，中日双方互设常驻民间商务代表机构，原是签订第二次中日贸易协定时，由日本方面的代表宇田耕一提出的，当时日本方面的代表团团长池田政之辅也表示赞同，中国方面几经考虑才同意了日本方面的意见。这个问题曾载入第二次中日贸易谈判的备忘录，后来又列入第三次中日贸易协定本文。在互设常驻的民间商务代表机构问题上，中国方面除了主张应在对等的基础上，互相给予对方工作人员以安全保证和工作方便以外，从来没有提过其他条件。而日本政府却先以指纹问题、然后以限制代表机构的人数问题为借口，后来又在悬挂国旗和莫须有的“特权”问题上大作文章，极力阻挠原由日本方面提出的互设贸易代表机构问题的实现，这难道不是政治？把“国内法”“没有承认政府这个事实”“国际关系”当作前提条件，使贸易协定无法实施，这难道不是政治？可见，把贸易同政治联系起来的，不是中国方面，而恰恰是日本岸信介政府。
    过去，中日双方已经签订并且实施过三次贸易协定，都没有涉及中日两国互相承认的问题，第四次中日贸易协定依然是双方民间团体之间的协定，也同这个问题根本无关。过去，中国在日本举办商品展览会，日本在中国举办商品展览会，都曾悬挂过本国国旗，也没有发生互相承认与否的问题。中日两国之间至今没有恢复正常邦交，乃是日本政府追随美国对中国采取敌视政策所一手造成的。这种情况当然不符合中日两国人民要求友好，要求早日恢复邦交的愿望。但只要日本政府依然在美国的控制之下，同台湾蒋介石集团继续保持着所谓“外交关系”，中日两国就不可能恢复正式邦交。尽管如此，中国方面还是积极协助两国民间团体，展开中日两国人民的友好活动，签订了贸易协定，发展了两国之间的贸易。而岸信介政府在这次协定签订之后，却假借国旗问题大作文章，并且三番五次地弹唱不承认中国的滥调，这是什么意思呢？这只能有一个解释，就是借口“国内法”，来破坏双方对等的原则，借口“不承认”和“国际关系”，企图强使中日贸易关系服从于日美、日蒋关系，借此来讨好美国和蒋介石集团。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    负责同中国签订了贸易协定的日本方面的首席代表池田政之辅还有一种解释：日本政府并不是不让中国商务代表机构悬挂国旗，只是“不承认”这种“权利”罢了。并且说中国方面对此有“误解”。我们一点也没有误解。既然不承认“有权”，那还谈得上什么保证？东京警视厅不是已经透露消息说，如果有“狂热分子”攻击中国国旗，并不会因此遭到控诉吗？至于岸信介把中国国旗看成是私人财产的荒谬言论，更是对中国人民的莫大侮辱。试问，假如中国人民把日本国旗不看作是代表日本国家的标志，而只是私人财产，日本人民又将作何感想？
    岸信介政府还恶意地散布了一些仿佛中国方面向日本要求“外交特权”的谰言。最近日本法务省一名官员竟诬蔑中国民间商务代表机构一旦派去日本后会设立秘密电台。这类谎言的实质就是要在日本人民中间散布不信任新中国的毒氛，破坏几年来日益增进的两国人民的友谊。
    岸信介政府玩弄了一系列政治手法，蓄意破坏第四次中日贸易协定，却反咬一口说中国方面有什么“政治目的”，这岂是能掩尽天下耳目的？如果说中国方面有什么“政治目的”，那就是要在发展两国贸易的同时，也增进两国人民的友谊。这个“目的”，是明文载在贸易协定之内，并且也是日本人民所赞同的。难道不这样，而像日本政府那样，一方面对中国采取露骨的敌视态度，一方面想从中日贸易中捞一把，倒是“合理”的吗？
    中国同日本签订贸易协定的出发点是基于平等互利的原则来发展两国贸易。中国方面的主张从来是和协定和备忘录的精神相符合的。目前的问题，完全在于日本岸信介政府是否放弃敌视中国人民的态度，无条件地保证第四次中日贸易协定的各项条款的实施。中国方面据理坚持经过双方一致同意的原则，怎么会是一种“过火”的行为呢？难道一定要中国方面同意把中日贸易关系屈服于日美、日蒋关系之下，才算是不“过火”？但是中国人民在这个问题上是绝不会妥协的。
    我们对于中日两国人民的贸易前途还是乐观的。虽然目前碰到了阻碍，但中日两国人民过去为发展两国贸易和两国人民的友好关系，曾经冲破不少困难，今后也一定会拨开暂时罩在头上的乌云，看到晴天的。
