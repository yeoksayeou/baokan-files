    Facing the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, scientific work must also make a great leap forward, and historical research is no exception. Every historical science worker wants to leap forward, and wants to leap forward greatly. There is enough enthusiasm, but the question is how to leap forward. Comrade Chen Boda gave us a speech, asking us to "emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past, learn while doing." The question of how to leap forward is solved. Now the question is how to understand and implement this instruction. Of course, if there are different opinions on Comrade Boda's speech, they can be raised for discussion. Here are just my personal views.

    When discussing history, emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past is a very natural principle. Modern and contemporary events are the easiest to understand and have the most practical significance. However, the current situation in the historical field is exactly the opposite: de-emphasizing the present and emphasizing the past. The more recent the event, the less it is discussed; the more ancient the event, the more it is discussed. This is truly an abnormal phenomenon, a sign of decline. Comrade Boda emphasized this to us, and it is absolutely necessary for us to correct it quickly.

    Those who hold the view of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present also have their ideas, believing that academics are independent and lose their independence when involved in politics, and thus cease to be academics. Discussing the past does not involve politics, so it is academic. Discussing the present always involves politics, so it is not academic. Is this idea reasonable? I would like to raise a few simple examples to discuss with those who emphasize the past and de-emphasize the present.

    Emphasizing the Present and De-emphasizing the Past is the Tradition of Chinese Historiography

    Because you emphasize the past, I cannot help but start with the past:

    In China's feudal era, there were three major historical works: First, the Spring and Autumn Annals. It is Confucius's political science, the basic political science of the entire feudal era. Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, from the first year of Duke Yin of Lu to the fourteenth year of Duke Ai. A year later, in the sixteenth year of Duke Ai, Confucius died. The Spring and Autumn Annals record 240 years of events. According to the Gongyang school, the Spring and Autumn Annals are divided into three ages: the "seen" age corresponds to the era of Confucius and his father, which can be said to be contemporary history at the time. The "heard" age corresponds to the era of Confucius's grandfather, and the "transmitted" age corresponds to the era of Confucius's great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather, which can be said to be contemporary history at the time. Nothing is written above that. Confucius was an advocate of antiquity, but in writing the Spring and Autumn Annals, he was like a "emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past" historian. Is the Spring and Autumn Annals detached from politics and purely academic? Why were "rebellious ministers and traitors afraid"? Wasn't it because they feared its political condemnation? Second, the Records of the Grand Historian. Sima Qian wrote the Records of the Grand Historian, from the Five Emperors to Emperor Wu of Han. Can you say that he de-emphasized the present? The Annals of the Current Emperor in the Records of the Grand Historian have long been lost, but the criticisms of Emperor Wu of Han in the Treatise on the Balance of Weights and the Treatise on Sacrifices to Heaven and Earth, is this not discussing politics? Third, Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian (Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Governance). Although this book is a bit inferior to the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Records of the Grand Historian, and does not write about the history of the Song Dynasty, it does write about the Five Dynasties. Looking at the title of the book, you can know that the purpose of writing the book is to teach feudal political science to the court. Which of the "Chen Guang said" in the book does not discuss politics? In addition to these three most famous historical books, whether it is official history or unofficial history, it is always written for a certain political purpose. Official history narrates the political activities of one dynasty or several dynasties. The narration contains the political views of the writer, not to mention the specifically written eulogies, critiques, essays, and historians' remarks for praise and criticism. Unofficial history is mostly written during the transition between two dynasties, especially when foreign ethnic groups invaded and ruled China, of course with strong political overtones. The Qing Dynasty banned unofficial history and carried out literary inquisitions on a large scale. If historical works have nothing to do with politics, why did the Qing Dynasty rulers kill so many people? Because the literary inquisitions were extremely cruel, Qing Dynasty scholars were forced to give up writing history and turn their energy to the study of classics – textual research – which was detached from politics. This was a perverted and morbid phenomenon that occurred under barbaric pressure, and it was not the same as Gu Tinglin's advocacy of learning for practical application in classical studies – textual research. When the Chinese bourgeoisie emerged in the late Qing Dynasty, it put forward its own political propositions, and academics and politics were combined again. For example, Kang Youwei wrote New Text Forgeries and Confucius's Reform, with the aim of reform and renovation. These academic works on classics and history were also political works of the bourgeois reformists. The National Essence Journal, founded by scholars from Jiangsu and Zhejiang such as Zhang Taiyan and Liu Shipei, aimed to expel the Manchus and restore the Han. In the journal, the study of history mainly promoted the expulsion of the Manchus, and the study of classics mainly advocated the restoration of the Han. These academic journals discussing classics and history were also political publications of the bourgeois revolutionaries. It can be seen that the early representatives of the Chinese bourgeoisie did not have the idea that academics should be separated from politics.

    Historical books have various styles, and naturally there are various different writing methods. Some express obvious political character, some express it less obviously or not at all related to politics. No matter what form it takes, it is ultimately a reflection of the political life of the time. However, historical works that clearly reflect the political life of the time are ultimately the normal form of history, the mainstream of history. From the Spring and Autumn Annals to the historical essays in the National Essence Journal, they should represent historical works of various periods. In addition, historical books that do not reflect the political life of the time can only exist as a perverted branch.

    Emphasizing the Past and De-emphasizing the Present is the Scholarly Style of the Bourgeoisie

    After the May Fourth Movement, Chinese historiography gained the guidance of Marxism, began to show epoch-making development, and became a force serving the people's revolution. In order to resist the revolution, scholars of the reactionary ruling class advocated the separation of academics from politics, attempting to make academics detached from revolutionary politics and become soulless dead things. In fact, they also wanted to combine reactionary politics and academics. Jiang Tingfu and others once wrote a modern history of China, combining politics and academics, but for them, the result was very bad. The confession of traitors was made without prompting. I remember that someone spoke favorably of Qin Hui in one of his books, causing an "uproar in public opinion" in the newspapers. Wasn't this an attempt to defend Chiang Kai-shek but instead clearly telling people that Chiang Kai-shek was Qin Hui? In this respect, Hu Shi was much more cunning than those dullards. He was a reactionary politician and a reactionary scholar. Academics and politics were closely combined in him, but in terms of expression, he generally adopted the method of separating politics and academics, writing many trivial and fragmentary textual research articles with so-called meticulous effort. Among them, textual research on some unimportant people and events was regarded as historical research, believing that textual research was equal to history. Since they said that history was a "garbage dump," then picking up a few words and phrases for textual research could also be called doing historical work. Hu Shi did this, and taught his followers to do the same. What are the benefits of doing this? People who fall into the quagmire of formalism: (1) do not care about revolutionary politics, and therefore may tend to reactionary politics; (2) do not care about reactionary politics, and therefore are conducive to Chiang Kai-shek's unbridled behavior. Whether it is (1) or (2), it is beneficial to Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, academics that are detached from politics are precisely political academics that serve reactionary politics. How clever!

    Hu Shi has been thoroughly criticized by us in recent years, and generally speaking, our historical circles have seen him clearly. But there are still two types of people: one is a conscious disciple of Hu Shi, who still adheres to the view of academic independence to this day, refusing academics to serve politics, that is, refusing to serve socialism, to serve 600 million people; that is, refusing to learn the Marxist stance, viewpoint, and method to apply to their academic research. This kind of person is a very small minority, but we must wage war against him. There is also a type of person who is unconsciously influenced. During the rule of Chiang Kai-shek, they did not understand Marxism, nor were they satisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary politics, and felt that Hu Shi's set of arguments could allow them to settle down, so they learned to do some trivial and fragmentary textual research articles. When choosing topics, they always try to stay as far away from reality as possible. The lonely Three Dynasties thus became a bustling market. Because the habit of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present has been formed, it is inevitable to feel difficult to change to emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past. However, they are willing to learn Marxism and have achieved more or less success. This type of person is more numerous, and after self-transformation efforts to get rid of the old influence, they are an important force in our historical circles.

    The two types of people, conscious disciples of Hu Shi and those who are unconsciously influenced, have different situations, but their academic style of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present, evading reality, and detaching from politics is the same. This is indeed "the style of the bourgeoisie left behind, not the style of the proletariat, not the style of Marxism." Comrade Chen Boda made a stern accusation against this "formalistic style of learning that must mention the Three Dynasties." We should reflect deeply and jump out of the "ivory tower."

    What I said above can be summarized as saying that in today's socialist construction, it is wrong to maintain the idea that academics are detached from politics. Academics must serve politics. If we do not sweep away the academic style of emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present that arises from this wrong idea, there is no possibility of any leap forward in history.

    Below, I will talk about some of my understandings of Comrade Boda's speech.

    Emphasizing the Present and De-emphasizing the Past and Emphasizing the Past and De-emphasizing the Present are the Struggle Between Two Lines

    Emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past and emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present are the manifestations of the two lines existing in the historical field. There must also be a struggle between the two lines of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and promoting bourgeois ideology and eliminating proletarian ideology. It is impossible to compromise and coexist; either the proletarian ideology eliminates bourgeois ideology, or the bourgeois ideology eliminates proletarian ideology. Our Marxist historians must recognize this and take on the responsibility of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. No matter how much Marxism we have learned, it does not matter if we have learned little now. As long as we learn, we will learn more. As long as historians clearly stand on the Marxist front ideologically and determine that they are Marxists, the momentum will be strong and the strength will come. Those bourgeois scholars who claim to have academics, if they dare to cock their tails in front of the people and refuse to reform, we should despise them without mercy. We must know that anyone who puts on airs must be mediocre and shallow. The so-called academics they rely on are stored in small vessels, so it can be imagined that they are not much and not big. Our Marxist historians are fully confident in eliminating the influence of bourgeois academics in history in a relatively short period of time.

    To emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past, the first thing to do is to expand and strengthen the forces studying modern history, mainly studying the Chinese history of the proletariat leading the revolution, followed by the Chinese history of the bourgeoisie leading the old democratic revolution. Work hard and use achievements to prove that the significance of emphasizing the present far outweighs that of emphasizing the past. The second thing to do is to truly use the Marxist stance, viewpoint, and method to conduct research. Only in this way can we achieve true achievements in the study of modern history. Otherwise, the so-called academics of the bourgeoisie will also sneak into modern history. For example, verifying whether Hong Xiuquan had a beard is a manifestation of formalism sneaking into modern history. More dangerous and already having some influence is using Marxist rhetoric and the sophistry commonly used by bourgeois research academics to distort modern history. The problems involved are quite large, and the harm to Marxist academics is also quite serious. It is necessary to prevent and stop it as soon as possible. Filling the forces of modern history research and maintaining the healthy development of modern history research, the academic style of emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past will naturally be established on a solid foundation, because the present is emphasized, and the past will relatively become de-emphasized.

    To emphasize the present and de-emphasize the past, in addition to expanding and strengthening the study of modern history, Marxist historians must also allocate some forces to occupy the position of ancient history. Ancient history is a stronghold for bourgeois scholars to conduct stubborn resistance. They occupy some points or fragments in ancient history, and in these small corners they claim to be kings and masters, with no one in sight. In fact, the territory they occupy is nothing more than a few Yelang Kingdoms (ancient state known for its isolation and ignorance). Marxist historians should write a few relatively good quality general histories, starting from the modern era and going through to the ancient era, from the economic base to the entire superstructure, so that the entire historical position is basically occupied. At the same time, occupy the Yelang Kingdoms one by one, so that those kings lose their basis and have to accept transformation. Comrade Guo used a small amount of effort to study oracle bone script and bronze inscriptions, and occupied this position. Otherwise, the scholars of the bourgeoisie who engage in this part would not know how much pride to show. This experience is worth learning. As long as we spend some effort, we can overwhelm them in any academic department. While we vigorously advocate emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past, we should also pay attention to this, so as not to let bourgeois scholars use emphasizing the past and de-emphasizing the present to oppose us.

    Carry out the Hundred Flowers Blooming, and Leading Cadres in the Historical Field Must Plant Experimental Fields

    Emphasizing the present and de-emphasizing the past, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology are issues on the ideological front and the academic front. No other methods can be used here. The only method that can be used is ideological struggle and academic debate. In order to achieve this goal, Marxists must first make every effort to open up the garden of the Hundred Flowers Blooming. In this garden, extensively carry out criticism and self-criticism. Relying on the method of learning while doing, our Marxist level can be gradually improved, and the academic issues discussed can also be gradually deepened. Second, our Marxist historians who are in charge of leadership must plant "experimental fields" and make some achievements in business. There are many benefits of planting "experimental fields": (1) One of the excuses for the bourgeois scholars' arrogance and conceit is that you can only talk but not do. If we make some achievements in our own field, can they still use this as an excuse? Is it possible to say that I am too busy with leadership work and do not have time to do business? This is certainly also a reason. However, can any worker in our Academy of Sciences say that he is busier than Comrade Guo? Comrade Guo has every reason to be exempt from planting "experimental fields," but he plants large fields connected by ridges, and the output is particularly abundant. What if we have a poor harvest in planting "experimental fields," and harvest five or one dou (unit of dry measure) per mu (unit of area)? If we harvest nothing, how can we not let them have an excuse! (2) Planting "experimental fields" will know the sweetness and bitterness of farming. In this way, we can share weal and woe with ordinary workers, which is of great benefit to improving leadership work. (3) It is possible that some academic workers are lazy and do not want to leap forward, or they want to leap forward but do not know how to do it. Leaders can play an exemplary role, which can turn the lazy into diligent, and those who do not know how to do it can learn the method. (4) If the leaders at the higher level plant "experimental fields," they can correct the mistakes of the leaders at the lower level more accurately, more concretely, and more persuasively. There is also one more important point. After the All-People Rectification Movement, 600 million people have all leaped forward. Farmers are leaping forward to four, five, or eight; workers are even more amazing. In fifteen years, they will surpass and catch up with Britain in the output of steel and major industrial products. Reading the newspaper every day makes people excited every day. Under such circumstances, it would be very bad if there were people in the social science departments who did not leap forward, and even some were leaders.

    My understanding of Comrade Chen Boda's speech is not good enough, and mistakes are inevitable. I am raising it here in the hope of receiving guidance from comrades.

    历史研究必须厚今薄古
    范文澜
    面临着工农业生产大跃进的形势，科学工作也必须大跃进，历史研究也不例外。历史科学工作者谁都想跃进，谁都想大大的跃进，干劲是足够的，问题在于如何跃进。陈伯达同志给我们讲话，要我们“厚今薄古、边干边学”，如何跃进的问题解决了。现在的问题是如何理解和如何实行这个指示。当然，对伯达同志的讲话有不同意见的，还可以提出来讨论，这里只是我个人的看法。
    讲历史，厚今薄古，本来是很自然的道理。现代近代的事情，最容易理解，也最有现实意义。可是，现在史学界的情况恰恰是薄今厚古，越是今的越不讲，越是古的越讲，这实在是一种反常的现象，是一种衰暮的现象。伯达同志给我们着重指出来，要我们赶快纠正，是完全必要的。
    持厚古薄今论的人也有他们的想法，以为学术是独立的东西，牵涉到政治就失去独立性，就不成其为学术。讲古，不牵涉政治，所以是学术。讲今，总要牵涉到政治，所以不是学术。这种想法有道理么？我想举出极简单的事例和厚古薄今论者商量商量。
    厚今薄古是中国史学的传统
    因为你们厚古，我不免从古说起：
    我国封建时代有三部最大的历史著作：第一，春秋。是孔子的政治学，是整个封建时代的基本政治学。孔子作春秋，从鲁隐公元年写到哀公十四年。隔了一年，哀公十六年，孔子就死了。春秋记载二百四十年的事情，按照公羊家的说法，春秋分三世：所见世相当于孔子和他父亲的年代，可以说是当时的现代史。所闻世相当于孔子祖父的年代，所传闻世相当于孔子曾祖高祖父的年代，可以说是当时的近代史。再往上就不写了。孔子是好古主义者，但在写春秋这一点上，倒像是个“厚今薄古”的史学家。春秋是脱离政治专谈学术的么？为什么“乱臣贼子惧”，还不是怕它在政治上的诛伐？第二，史记。司马迁作史记，从五帝一直写到汉武帝，能说他薄今么？史记的今上本纪固然早已失传，但在平准书、封禅书中对汉武帝提出批评，这是不是谈政治呢？第三，司马光的资治通鉴。这部书虽然比春秋、史记差一点，没有写宋朝的历史，但也写到五代。看书名就知道他写书的目的是为朝廷讲封建政治学，书中的“臣光曰”，那一条不是谈政治的？这三部最著名的史书以外，不论正史或野史，总是为一定的政治目的而写成的。正史叙述一个朝代或若干朝代的政治活动，在叙述中就含有写作者的政治观点，更不用说，赞、评、论、史臣曰等等的专为褒贬而作。野史的写成，多在两朝交替特别是在外族侵入统治中国的时候，当然有强烈的政治性。清朝因禁止野史，大兴文字狱。如果历史著作与政治无关，清朝统治者何苦杀许多人呢。由于文字狱十分残酷，清朝学者才被迫放弃写历史，把精力转到脱离政治的经学——考据学上去，这完全是在野蛮压力下发生的变态病态，与顾亭林倡导学以致用的经学——考据学不是一回事了。到了清季中国产生资产阶级，它提出自己的政治主张，学术和政治又结合起来。举例来看，康有为作新学伪经考、孔子改制考，以变法维新为宗旨。这些讲经学、史学的学术著作，同时也是资产阶级改良派的政治著作。江浙学人章太炎、刘师培等人创办的国粹学报，以排满复汉为宗旨。在学报里，讲史学主要是宣传排满，讲经学主要是提倡复汉，这些谈经学史学的学术刊物，同时也是资产阶级革命派的政治刊物。由此可见，中国资产阶级的早期代表人物并无学术应该和政治脱离的说法。
    史书有多种体裁，自然有各种不同的写法。有些表现出明显的政治性，有些表现得不那么明显或完全与政治无关，不论表现的形式如何，归根都是当时政治生活的一种反映。但是，明显地反映出当时政治生活的历史著作。终究是史学的正常形态，是史学的主流，自春秋以至国粹学报史篇都应是代表各个时期的历史著作。此外，不反映当时政治生活的史书，只能作为变态支流而存在。
    厚古薄今是资产阶级的学风
    “五四”运动以后，中国历史学获得了马克思主义的指导，开始表现划时代的大发展，成为服务于人民革命的一个力量。反动统治阶级的学者们，为了对抗革命，提倡学术与政治脱离，企图使学术脱离革命的政治，变成没有灵魂的死东西。事实上，他们自也是想把反动的政治和学术结合起来的。蒋廷黻等人曾写中国近代史，把政治与学术结合了，可是对他们说来，结果坏得很，卖国贼的口供，不打自招了。记得有一个人在他的一本书里替秦桧说好话，闹得报纸上“舆论哗然”，这不是想替蒋介石辩护反而明明白白告诉人们说蒋介石就是秦桧么？在这一点上，胡适比那些笨伯们狡猾得太多。他是反动政客兼反动学者，学术和政治在他身上紧紧结合在一起，但在表现形式上却一般是采取政治和学术分开的手法，写出许多琐琐碎碎一字一句所谓点滴功夫的考据文。其中考一些无关紧要的人和事的考据文，就当作研究历史，认为考据等于历史，他们既然把历史说成“垃圾堆”，那末，捡些片言只字考一考，也就可以自称为做史学工作了。胡适这样做，教他的追随者也这样做。这样做的好处何在呢？掉进烦琐主义泥坑里的人，（一）不关心革命的政治，因而可能倾向于反动的政治；（二）不关心反动的政治，因而有利于蒋介石的横行无阻。无论是（一）或（二）都对蒋介石有好处，所以，脱离政治的学术正是为反动政治服务的政治性学术，多么巧妙呵！
    胡适，经过我们近几年来大规模的批判，一般地说，我们史学界已经看清楚了。但还有两种人：一种是自觉的胡适门徒，直到今天还坚持学术独立的看法，拒绝学术为政治服务，也就是拒绝为社会主义服务，为六亿人民服务；也就是拒绝学习马克思主义的立场观点和方法来运用到自己的学术研究上去。这种人是极少数，但是必须对他开战。还有一种人是不自觉的受影响者。他们在蒋介石统治时期，不了解马克思主义，也不满意蒋介石的反动政治，觉得胡适那套说法可以安身立命，因此，学习做一些琐琐碎碎点点滴滴的考据文章。挑选题目，总要离开现实愈远愈好，寂寞的三代于是变成了热闹的市场。因为厚古薄今的习惯已经养成，要改到厚今薄古的方面来，不免感到困难。但是，他们是愿意学习马克思主义的，而且已经取得或多或少的成绩。这种人为数较多，经过自我改造的努力，把旧影响抛掉，是我们史学界的重要力量。
    自觉的胡适门徒和不自觉的受影响者两种人情况不同，但他们厚古薄今，逃避现实、脱离政治的学风是一样的。这确实是“资产阶级遗留下来的风气，不是无产阶级的风气，不是马克思主义的风气”。陈伯达同志对这种“言必称三代的烦琐主义的学风”，予以严正的指责，我们应该深刻反省，从“象牙之塔”跳出来。
    上面所说的话，总起来就是说，在社会主义大建设的今天，还保持学术脱离政治的想法是错误的。学术一定要为政治服务。不扫清从这个错误想法产生出来的厚古薄今的学风，历史学根本谈不到有什么跃进的可能。
    下面，我谈谈对伯达同志讲话的一些体会。
    厚今薄古与厚古薄今是两条路线的斗争
    厚今薄古与厚古薄今是史学界存在着两条路线的表现，这里面也必然存在着兴无灭资和兴资灭无两条路线的斗争。不是无灭资，就是资灭无，想妥协并存是不可能的。我们马克思主义的史学工作者必须认清这一点，担当起兴无灭资的责任。不管我们学到的马克思主义有多少，现在少不要紧，只要学就会多起来，史学工作者在思想上明确地站在马克思主义阵线这一边，确定自己是马克思主义者，只要这种气势壮，力量也就来了。那些自称为有学术的资产阶级学者，如果敢于在人民面前翘尾巴，拒绝改造，我们应该毫不留情的藐视他们，要知道，凡是装腔作势的人，一定是庸妄浅薄的人，他所自恃的一点所谓学术，既然装在小器里，其不多不大，可以想见。我们马克思主义史学工作者，在较短的期间内，消除资产阶级学术在史学上的影响，是完全有把握的。
    厚今薄古第一必须扩大和加强研究今史的力量，主要是研究无产阶级领导革命的中国史，其次是资产阶级领导旧民主革命的中国史。认真地下功夫，用成绩来证明厚今的意义远胜于厚古。第二必须确实用马克思主义的立场观点和方法来进行研究，只有这样，才能在今史研究上取得真正的成绩。否则，资产阶级的所谓学术也会窜进今史里面来，例如考证洪秀全有没有胡子，这就是烦琐主义窜进今史的表现。更危险的而且已经发生一些影响的是用马克思主义的词句，用资产阶级研究学术所常用的诡辩方法，来歪曲今史，牵涉的问题相当大，危害马克思主义学术也相当严重，及早予以防阻是必要的。充实今史研究的力量，并且保持今史研究的健全发展，厚今薄古的学风自然会在坚固的基础上建立起来，因为今厚了，古也就相对地变薄了。
    厚今薄古，在扩大和加强今史的研究以外，马克思主义史学工作者还必须分出一部分力量去占领古史的阵地。古史是资产阶级学者进行顽抗的据点，他们在古史上占了些点或片段，就在这些小角落里称王称霸，目空一切。其实，他们所占据的地盘，不过是若干个夜郎国而已。马克思主义史学工作者应该写出几部质量比较好的通史来，从现代开始通到古代，从经济基础通到全部上层建筑，这样整个历史阵地，基本上都占领下来了。同时逐个占领夜郎国，使那些国王们失去依据，不得不接受改造。郭老曾用不多的功夫，研究甲骨文、金文，把这个阵地占领过来，不然的话，资产阶级搞这一部分的学者，不知道要表现多大的骄气。这个经验是值得学习的。我们只要花点功夫，任何一个学术部门都可以压倒他们。我们在大力提倡厚今薄古的同时，也应该注意到这一点，免得资产阶级学者拿厚古薄今来和我们对立。
    开展百家争鸣，史学界领导干部要种试验田
    厚今薄古、兴无灭资是思想战线、学术战线上的问题，这里丝毫不能用其他办法，唯一可用的办法是思想斗争，学术争论。马克思主义者为要达到这个目的，第一，必须全力开辟百家争鸣的园地。在这个园地里广泛展开批评和自我批评，依靠边干边学的方法，我们的马克思主义水平逐步可以得到提高，所讨论的学术问题也逐步可以得到深入。第二，我们担负领导工作的马克思主义史学工作者，必须种“试验田”，在业务上做出些成绩来。种“试验田”的好处很多：（一）资产阶级学者狂妄自大的借口之一，是说你们只会说不会做。如果我们做出些自己本行的业务来，他们还能拿这个做借口么？是不是可以说，我领导工作太忙，没有功夫作业务，这当然也是一个理由。但是，我们科学院任何一个工作者，能够说比郭老还忙么？郭老有十足的理由免种“试验田”，可是他种的是阡陌相连的大田，出产品特别丰收。我们种“试验田”来个歉收，一亩收五升一斗可不可以呢？如果我们颗粒无收，怎么不让他们有所借口呢！（二）种“试验田”就会知道种田的甘苦所在，这样，就可以同一般工作者同甘共苦，对领导工作的改进有很大的好处。（三）可能有些学术工作者懒惰不想跃进，或者想跃进不得其法，领导者起示范作用，可以使懒者变勤，不得法者得法。（四）上级领导者种“试验田”，对下级领导者的错误可以纠正得更准确些，更具体些，更有说服力些。还有一点，也是更重要的一点，经过全民整风运动，六万万人都跃进了。农民向四、五、八跃进；工人更是了不起，十五年在钢铁和主要工业产品产量方面要超过和赶上英国，每天看报，使人每天兴奋。在这种情况下，社会科学部门有不跃进的人甚至有些还是领导工作者，那就很不好了。
    我对陈伯达同志的讲话体会得很不够，错误也很难免，在这里提出来，希望得到同志们的指教。
