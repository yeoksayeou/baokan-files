    Brief Introduction to Soybean Production in China
    Soybeans have been cultivated in China for over four thousand years, distributed throughout the north and south provinces. The Songliao Plain and the Yellow River-Huai River Plain are the main soybean production areas, with their output accounting for approximately 80% of the national total.

    Based on China's natural conditions and local farming practices, soybean producing areas can be divided into: spring planting areas, summer planting areas, autumn planting areas, and double-cropping areas. Northeast China, Hebei, Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, southern Gansu, northeastern Qinghai, and other regions are spring soybean planting areas. In this area, soybeans are mostly sown in May and harvested in September. Most areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the plains of the Huai River basin, the Guanzhong Plain, the Hanzhong Plain, northern Sichuan, and some areas in the Yangtze River basin are summer soybean planting areas. Here, soybeans are generally sown in May and June and mature in October. The entire province of Fujian, southern Zhejiang and Jiangxi, eastern Guangdong, and north-central Guangxi are autumn soybean planting areas. In these areas, soybeans are generally sown after the early rice harvest and harvested in November. The double-cropping soybean area includes most of Guangdong Province and the southern parts of Guangxi and Yunnan provinces. This area is frost-free year-round and can grow two crops of soybeans each year.

    The soybean planting area has expanded since liberation. In 1953, it was 180 million mu, exceeding the pre-war planting area of 140 million mu. Total soybean production has also increased. Taking 1949 as 100, it increased to 187.2 in 1952 and 202.3 in 1956. The increase in soybean yield per unit area has been relatively slow. The national average yield in 1956 was 114.5 jin per mu, only 12% higher than the average yield from 1949 to 1955. In Northeast China, the average annual soybean yield is 140 to 170 jin per mu, while in the Yellow River-Huai River Plain, the average annual yield is around 100 jin per mu. However, high yield records in these areas are around 700 jin per mu, and high-yield fields with a large area of 300 jin per mu can be found everywhere. This shows that the soybean production level can be greatly improved.

    "Northeast Soybean"
    For decades, the Chinese soybean renowned in the international market has actually been the soybean produced in the three northeastern provinces. Currently, China's soybean export trade reaches eighteen countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

    Northeast soybeans are not exactly the same as the yellow soybeans in North and Central China. They are large, round, and have a high oil content. The best "Man Cang Jin" (Full Granary Gold) variety has an oil content of about 21%.

    我国大豆生产简况
    大豆在我国的栽培历史已有四千多年，分布南北各省。松辽平原和黄河淮河平原是大豆的主要产区，这两个产区的大豆产量，约占全国总产量的80％左右。
    根据我国自然条件和各地耕作习惯，大豆产区可以分为：春播区、夏播区、秋播区和两熟区。东北地区、河北、山西、陕西北部、甘肃南部、青海东北部等地区，是春播大豆区。这个区的大豆，多在5月播种9月收获。黄河中、下游多数地区和淮河流域平原、关中平原、汉中平原、四川北部和长江流域的一些地区，是夏播大豆区。这里大豆一般在5、6月间播种，10月间成熟。福建全省，浙江、江西南部。广东东部和广西中北部是秋播大豆区。这些地区一般在早稻收获后播大豆，11月收割。大豆两熟区是广东省大部、广西、云南两省的南部。这个地区终年无霜，每年可以栽种两季大豆。
    大豆的种植面积在解放以后有了扩大，1953年是一亿八千万亩，超过战前的一亿四千万亩的种植面积。大豆的总产量也有提高，以1949年为一百，1952年增长为一百八十七点二，1956年增长为二百零二点三。大豆的单位产量的提高则比较缓慢。1956年全国平均产量一百一十四斤半，比1949到1955年的平均产量才高12％多。我国东北地区大豆常年平均亩产一百四十斤到一百七十斤，黄河淮河平原常年平均亩产一百斤左右，而这些地区的高额丰产纪录都在七百斤左右，大面积的亩产三百斤的丰产田，到处可以找到。这说明大豆的生产水平可能大大提高。
    “东北大豆”
    几十年来国际市场上驰名的中国大豆，实际就是东北三省出产的大豆。目前我国大豆出口贸易，远及亚、非、欧三大洲十八个国家。
    东北大豆和华北、华中的黄豆不完全一样。粒大滚圆，含油量高。最好的“满仓金”良种，含油量能达到21％左右。
