Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 14th: Various circles in Japan are demanding that the Japanese government reconsider its reply to the three Japanese trade groups regarding the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

The Japan Socialist Party held a meeting of the Special Committee for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations in the Diet Building today to discuss the telegram from Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, to the three Japanese groups, and future countermeasures on Sino-Japanese trade issues.

The Socialist Party decided to make every effort to ensure the implementation of the agreement and to urge the government to reconsider the matter.

Therefore, the chairman of this special committee, Minoru Nakazaki, met with Masanosuke Ikeda of the Liberal Democratic Party this afternoon, suggesting that he convene a meeting of the board of directors and a plenary meeting of the Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade tomorrow; and, quickly convene a consultation meeting of the three groups to discuss follow-up measures. Masanosuke Ikeda agreed to hold the aforementioned meetings tomorrow morning and afternoon respectively to discuss countermeasures.

The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today demanding that the Japanese government withdraw its reply to the three Japanese trade groups regarding the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The statement said that the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was welcomed and supported by the Japanese people, who unanimously believed that it would further develop the friendly relations between China and Japan and open up a path for the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The statement strongly condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government's reply to the three trade groups and the statement issued by Aiichiro Fujiyama on behalf of the Japanese government, proving that the Japanese government is succumbing to and following the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and that it has abandoned its own will. The statement demanded that the Japanese government immediately withdraw this reply, which violates international credibility and undermines the Japanese economy, and unconditionally agree to the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

On the same day, Eichi Shukutani, Vice Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, stated at a press conference that the association will take all necessary measures, including convening a manufacturers' conference, to promote the full implementation of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement.

Prior to this, the "Central Joint Struggle Conference of Japanese Metal Unions," which included the Japan Federation of Steel Industry Workers' Unions, the National Metal Workers' Union, the All Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union, the All Japan Electrical Machinery Workers' Union Federation, the All Japan Electric Wire Industry Workers' Union, and the Vehicle Industry Workers' Union Federation, issued a statement on the 10th, strongly condemning Nobusuke Kishi's actions to obstruct Sino-Japanese trade, and at the same time demanding the early restoration of normal diplomatic relations with China.

    日本各界坚持信守中日贸易协定
    要岸信介政府重新考虑答复
    据新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本各界要求日本政府重新考虑它交给日中贸易三个团体的关于第四次日中贸易协定的答复。
    日本社会党今天在国会大厦召开恢复日中邦交特别委员会会议，讨论了中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸给日本三团体的电报和今后对日中贸易问题的对策。
    社会党决定进行一切努力，坚决使协定能够实施，并且竭力促使政府重新考虑这个问题。
    因此，这个特别委员会的委员长中崎敏在今天下午会晤自由民主党的池田正之辅，建议他在明天召开国会议员促进日中贸易联盟理事会会议和全体会议；并且，迅速召开三个团体的协商会议，商定善后办法。池田正之辅同意在明天上下午分别举行上述会议商讨对策。
    日本共产党中央委员会今天发表声明，要求日本政府撤销它交给日中贸易三团体的关于第四次日中贸易协定的答复。声明说，第四次日中贸易协定的签订，受到了日本人民的欢迎和支持，日本人民一致认为，从此能够使日中两国的友好关系更加发展，并能为恢复两国邦交开辟一条大道。声明强烈指责岸信介政府给予贸易三团体的答复和爱知揆一代表日本政府发表的声明证明日本政府是屈从和追随美国和蒋介石集团的，它放弃了自己的意志。声明要求日本政府即时撤销这个违背国际信义和破坏日本经济的答复，并且立即无条件地同意第四次日中贸易协定。
    同一天，日本国际贸易促进协会副会长宿谷荣一在记者招待会上发表谈话表示，协会将要采取包括召开厂商大会在内的一切必要措施，促使完全实施日中贸易协定。
    在这以前，有日本钢铁产业工会联合会、全国金属工会、全日本造船工会、全日本电机机器工会联合会、全日本电线工业工会、车辆产业工会联合会等参加的“日本金属工会中央共同斗争会议”，10日发表了一项声明，强烈指责岸信介妨碍日中贸易的行为，同时要求早日同中国恢复正常的外交关系。
