Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd Dispatch: The American economic crisis is developing deeply in all aspects. The American official claim that "the recession has reached bottom" has been completely refuted by the facts. At present, the trends of declining industrial production, agricultural surplus, and employment situation in the United States are continuing to worsen.

According to reports from American news agencies, American industrial production continues to decline. In the week ending on the 19th, the operating rate of the steel industry was less than 48%, and output decreased by more than 9% compared to a month ago, and 44% compared to a year ago. The situation in the metal smelting industry is also similarly bad. The economic crisis has reduced the demand for metal raw materials in many industrial sectors. Kennecott Copper Corporation, the largest copper mining company in the United States, has announced production cuts three times this year. Output has been reduced by about one-third. Reynolds Aluminum Company has also announced that it will greatly reduce production to meet "business needs." National zinc production in February decreased by 15% compared to January and 36% compared to April 1957.

In the week ending on the 19th, the production of American cars and trucks decreased by more than one-third compared to a year ago. Many automobile factories have recently closed assembly shops and stopped production. In the week ending April 11, oil production decreased by 17% compared to last year. Due to the sluggishness of the manufacturing sector, American electricity production in the week ending April 12 decreased by 3.3% compared to the same period a year ago; railway freight volume decreased by 22.7%.

The US government had pinned its hopes on increased construction activity for corporate recovery, but now it seems that the situation in this sector is also not good. In the sixteen weeks since January 1 this year, the number of large construction contracts received by American builders has decreased by 9% compared to a year ago.

The decline in American industrial production is also reflected in the decrease in gross national product. According to the US President's Council of Economic Advisers on the 18th, the national gross national product in the first quarter of this year has decreased by 8.6 billion US dollars compared to the fourth quarter of last year, and 16 billion US dollars compared to the third quarter of last year.

In terms of agriculture, the crisis of production "surplus" will become more serious. According to the Department of Agriculture, this year's wheat harvest will reach 1.214 billion bushels (1 bushel equals 36 liters), but exports and domestic consumption are estimated to be about 1.06 billion bushels, and after offsetting the two, there will still be 180 million bushels that cannot be sold. As for other grains and cotton, the problem of "surplus" is also worsening, which is bound to increase the pressure of the economic crisis.

With the development of the industrial and agricultural crisis, the number of unemployed people has increased unabated. The US Department of Labor announced on the 19th that in the week ending April 5, the number of unemployed workers in the United States receiving relief payments increased to 3,314,000, an increase of more than 37,000 from the previous week, more than double that of a year ago, reaching the highest record since the war.

At the same time, the so-called "anti-recession measures" taken by the US government have led to an increase in the fiscal deficit. Treasury Secretary Anderson estimated on the 18th that in the 1958 fiscal year ending on June 30 this year, the US budget deficit will exceed 3 billion US dollars. In the 1959 fiscal year, he believes that even if the treasury revenue is maintained at a high level, the budget will still have a deficit of 4 billion US dollars. Anderson said that Eisenhower had estimated at the beginning of this year that the 1958 fiscal year would only have a deficit of 400 million US dollars, and the 1959 fiscal year would even have a surplus of 500 million US dollars, but the current economic situation has changed the entire economic and financial landscape.

    美国经济危机还没有到底
    工业下降和农业过剩情况继续恶化
    “反衰退”措施已导致财政赤字增长
    新华社22日讯　纽约消息：美国经济危机正在各个方面深入地发展。美国官方所谓“衰退已经到底”的说法已经完全为事实所否定。目前美国的工业生产下降、农业过剩以及就业情况的趋势都在继续恶化。
    据美国通讯社报道，美国工业生产继续在走下坡路。在19日结束的一个星期内，钢铁业的开工率不到48％，产量比一个月前减少了9％以上，比一年前减少了44％。金属冶炼业的情况也同样坏。经济危机使得许多工业部门减少了对金属原料的需求。美国最大的一家铜矿公司——肯奈科特铜公司今年内已经三次宣布削减生产。产量约减少三分之一。雷诺兹铝公司也宣布要大大削减生产，以符合“商业的需求”情况。全国锌的产量在2月份比1月份减少了15％，比1957年4月份减少36％。
    在到19日为止的一周内，美国汽车和卡车的产量比一年前减少三分之一以上，许多汽车工厂最近都关闭装配车间，停止进行生产。在到4月11日为止的一周中，石油生产比去年减少17％。由于制造业部门的不景气，美国电力生产在到4月12日为止的一周中比一年前同时期减少3.3％；铁路货运量减少22.7％。
    美国政府曾经把企业好转的希望寄托在建筑活动的增加上，但是现在看来这一部门的情况也是不好的。在从今年1月1日开始的十六个星期内，美国建筑商收到的大型建筑合同数目比一年前下降了9％。
    美国工业生产的下降也反映在国民生产总值的减少中。据美国总统经济顾问委员会18日宣布，全国国民生产总值在今年第一季已经比去年第四季减少了八十六亿美元，比去年第三季减少了一百六十亿美元。
    在农业方面，生产“过剩”的危机将更加严重。据农业部公布，今年小麦的收成将达十二亿一千四百万蒲式耳（1蒲式耳合36市升），但是，出口和国内消费估计共约十亿六千万蒲式耳，两方面相抵以后还有一亿八千万蒲式耳卖不出去。至于其他谷物和棉花，“过剩”的问题也在恶化，这就势必加重经济危机的压力。
    随着工农业危机状况的发展，失业人数有增无已。美国劳工部19日宣布，到4月5日为止的一周内，美国领取救济金的失业工人数目增加到三百三十一万四千人，比前一周又多了三万七千多人，比一年前多一倍以上，达到战后的最高纪录。
    同时，美国政府所采取的所谓“反衰退措施”已经导致财政赤字的增长。财政部长安德逊18日估计，在今年6月30日结束的1958财政年度内，美国预算赤字将要超过三十亿美元。在1959财政年度，他认为国库收入即使维持在高水平，预算也将有四十亿美元的赤字。安德逊说，艾森豪威尔曾经在今年年初估计1958财政年度只会有四亿美元的赤字，而1959财政年度甚至还会有五亿美元的盈余，但是现在的经济状况已经改变了整个经济和财政面貌。
