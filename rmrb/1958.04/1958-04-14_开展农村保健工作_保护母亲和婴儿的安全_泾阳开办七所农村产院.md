    Jingyang Opens Seven Rural Maternity Hospitals

    (Based on a report from the Shaanxi Daily): Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, has opened seven rural maternity hospitals, which have been widely praised by local farmers.

    In October 1956, the Iron and Steel and Peace Agricultural Cooperatives in the county independently established a rural maternity hospital that met the needs of the masses. When this maternity hospital was established, cooperative members built earthen kang beds and mud bedside tables themselves. They also lent some utensils. It only cost more than 100 yuan, and it began receiving pregnant women within half a month. Now there are seven such maternity hospitals in the county.

    In the past, rural women here often gave birth at home. Due to the lack of strict disinfection during delivery, babies were prone to "Si Liu" wind (tetanus), and mothers were prone to puerperal fever. Now, with mothers giving birth in the hospital, the safety of both mother and baby can be guaranteed. According to statistics, 451 women in the county gave birth in these seven maternity hospitals last year, and both mothers and babies were safe. Zhao Dongliang's wife had given birth to several children before, but they all died shortly after birth. This time, she gave birth in the maternity hospital, and both mother and child were safe. These seven maternity hospitals have a total of twenty-six midwives, all of whom were selected and trained by the county maternal and child health station from midwives who had been trained before. Mothers only pay 1.5 yuan for delivery fees, and 0.4 yuan per day for kerosene, vegetables, cooking oil, and other expenses, plus 1.2 jin of flour.

    泾阳开办七所农村产院
    本报讯　据陕西日报报道：陕西泾阳县开办七所农村产院，受到当地农民的普遍赞扬。
    1956年10月，该县钢铁、和平农业社自己创办了一所适合群众要求的农村产院。这所产院开办时，由社员动手砌土炕、泥床头桌，他们还借出一些用具，只花了一百多元钱，在半月内就开始接收产妇。现在像这样的产院全县已有七所。
    过去，这里的农村产妇在家里分娩，往往因为接生消毒不严，婴儿容易感染“四六”风，产妇容易得产褥热；而现在，产妇住院分娩，就能保证产妇和婴儿平安。据统计，该县去年有四百五十一位产妇在这七所产院分娩，母子都很安全。赵栋梁的妻子从前生过几个孩子，都是生下不久就死了，这次到产院分娩，母子都很安全。这七所产院共有二十六位接生员，都是由县妇幼保健站在原来训练过的接生员中选拔培养的。产妇住院只交接生费一元五角，每日交灯油、菜、食油等费用四角，面粉一斤二两。
