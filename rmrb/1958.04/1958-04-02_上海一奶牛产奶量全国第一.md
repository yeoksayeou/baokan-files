    Shanghai Dairy Cow Achieves Nation's Highest Milk Production

    On March 28th, a dairy cow in Shanghai produced 133 jin of milk, exceeding the 130.5 jin daily production of the five-year-old "Beijing No. 1" dairy cow at the Beijing Public-Private Joint Venture Northern Suburb Livestock Farm by 2.5 jin, setting a new national record. This output approaches the highest daily yield of 140 jin for Soviet Dutch cows.

    This cow is a five-year-old Dutch dairy cow, number 400, raised by Chen Xueming, an excellent milker at the Shanghai Milk Company's Second Farm. Due to Chen Xueming's improved feeding methods and strengthened sanitation efforts, the cow's milk production doubled within ten days. (Attached picture)

    上海一奶牛产奶量全国第一
    3月28日上海市有一只奶牛产奶一百三十三斤，比北京市公私合营北郊畜牧场五岁的“北京一号”奶牛日产奶一百三十点五斤多二斤半，创造了全国最高纪录。这个产量接近苏联荷兰牛最高日产量一百四十斤的水平。
    这头牛是上海市牛奶公司第二牧场优秀挤奶员陈学明饲养的四○○号五岁荷兰奶牛。由于陈学明改进了饲养方法和加强了清洁工作，使这头牛在十天内产奶量增加了一倍。（附图片）
