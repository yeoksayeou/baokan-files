On the Question of Large-Scale Collection of Folk Songs
Guo Moruo's Response to Questions from the Editorial Department of "Folk Literature"

On April 14th, the Editorial Department of "Folk Literature" of the Chinese Folk Literature Research Association interviewed Comrade Guo Moruo, posing questions regarding the value and role of folk songs—folk literature—and their collection and organization. Comrade Guo Moruo shared his views.

I. A movement to collect folk songs is currently flourishing. What are your thoughts on this matter?

Answer: This is a very good thing. China has a tradition of collecting folk songs. In ancient times, there was a so-called "collecting songs" system. The three hundred poems of the "Book of Songs" mostly consist of folk songs. Throughout history, many good scholars have done this work. Now that the Party has taken charge of this, it's even better. In the past, people didn't pay attention to folk material. Literary magazines didn't publish old-style poems or folk material; they looked down on it. Around 1930, when I was still in Japan, I wrote an article in Tao Jingsun's "Mass Literature," advocating that literature should value folk songs and music should value gongs and drums. I was criticized for it! Chairman Mao has always valued folk material. After the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, when performing the Yangko dance, weren't they beating gongs and drums? Now that the Party has taken up the collection of folk songs, with all provinces and counties mobilized, a situation unprecedented will emerge. Confucius edited the "Book of Songs" with just over three hundred poems. We will collect who knows how many billions of songs in the future! The current collection work is being done by the masses, and many large and small Confuciuses will emerge everywhere.

Collection by the masses is excellent. But there should also be some professionals. The Folk Literature Research Association could focus on setting up a few branches, with several people in each region specializing in this work. It's a good practice that the collected folk songs are first printed as reference materials in various regions. The Folk Literature Research Association should do some work based on the local materials. It should select the best from the local data and research the issues within them. It is very necessary to hold a conference for folk literature workers in June this year. If, every certain period, like every Five-Year Plan, we compile a book of truly the best folk songs, selecting the best from those with roughly the same content, about three hundred songs or so, to form a new "Guo Feng," that would be extraordinary!

Folk songs have a great role in inspiring, educating, and organizing the masses, and they are indeed beautiful works of literature. I took a look at the two reference books you compiled (The Chinese Folk Literature Research Association printed two volumes of reference materials for compiling "Selections of Rural Great Leap Forward Songs" and "Selections of Industrial and Mining Great Leap Forward Songs," Volume 1), and there are excellent things in them. The Zhuang folk song "South of the Mountain, North of the Mountain" is very good (Note: Guo Lao is referring to this song: "My brother lives in Red Plum Village south of the mountain, my sister lives in Peach Blossom Village north of the mountain. I want to sing a folk song for my brother to hear, but the high mountain blocks the sound; I want to pick fresh flowers to send to my brother, but everyone asks when crossing the mountains. This year, advanced cooperatives are established, the south and north of the mountain are one family, I can see my beloved brother sooner or later, and he can truly hear the words in my heart").

Attention should be paid to the folk songs of ethnic minorities. There are many things like "Guo Feng" in their folk songs. This is related to their lives. After the Song Dynasty, the Han people were influenced by the teachings of the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi, and their thinking was constrained, diminishing their creativity. Now that ideological liberation has opened up, good things will emerge.

The songs of the Great Leap Forward must be collected, and the ancient things should not be discarded either. These things are also very valuable and meaningful.

Once the collection work is underway, research work must follow. Comparing the folk songs of different provinces and counties, of different ethnic minorities and Han, what are the differences and characteristics between this ethnicity and that ethnicity, are topics that should be researched.

II. What is the role of collecting folk literature in promoting creation and establishing a national style?

Answer: China's modern writers have poorly absorbed the traditions of their own nation. The approaches of Ai Qing and those like Hu Feng all came from abroad and cannot be accepted by the common people.

From the history of literature, the emergence of a new style always has folk literature leading the way. Chinese poetry was in four-character form for a very long time. Five-character poems only became fixed during the Jian'an and Zhengshi periods, but they already existed in folk songs. The emergence of seven-character poems was even later. During the Three Kingdoms period, most poems were five-character, with only Cao Pi writing a relatively good seven-character poem. But seven-character forms had already existed in folk songs and proverbs. The "Book of Later Han" quotes many folk rhymes and proverbs, most of which are in seven-character form.

The goodness of folk songs lies in their innocence and directness. This is something that poets can learn from. Literary creation has generally been divided into two schools. One school utters the scene before one's eyes directly, like "Spring grass grows in the pond," what wonderful poetry! The other school is about embellishment. Embellishment can be good, but often it's not. Wang Guowei called it "separated" and "not separated." True masters usually start from simplicity when young, go through embellishment, and then return to simplicity, which is not separated—separated, and then back to not separated. This is the so-called "nature after being refined." Truly good poems are all of this school. Learning from folk songs is very beneficial for establishing a simple and natural style.

Is folk literature a source or a stream? I say: in the old era it was a source, and in the new era it is both a source and a stream. In the old era, due to limitations in cultural levels, the people themselves could not write, they could only hum orally. Some good scholars found some embryonic things in the mouths of the people and recorded them, so that these oral works could be passed down and developed. Today, the people are cultured, and people like Qu Yuan will emerge from the people. However, amateur folk authors have their own professions. Sometimes, when they are inspired, they create works with content and a certain level, which still need professional writers to develop and process. When the amateur creations of the masses are improved, the level of professional writers will also improve. This is called "a rising tide lifts all boats"! Combined with folk and amateur creations of the masses, future writers' creations will be more magnificent and richer than they are now.

Historically speaking, most of the "Book of Songs" are folk works. Less than twenty poems can be traced to authors by name. But even taking "Guo Feng" as an example, it has been deleted and polished. Qu Yuan's twenty-five "Chu Ci," except for "Bu Ju," "Yu Fu," and some chapters in "Nine Chapters," were basically written by one person, with one style and one emotion. And everyone knows that Qu Yuan's works absorbed the style of folk songs and developed on the basis of folk songs.

The emergence of "Chu Ci" was in the period of transition from slave society to feudal society—other historians have different opinions on this point. This was a stage of great ideological revolution, somewhat like today, which would produce great philosophers and great poets like Qu Yuan. To this day, Qu Yuan is still the greatest poet in Chinese history, and no Chinese poet has surpassed his level.

China's folk literature is very rich, but we cannot be satisfied with just a rich mine. We must extract and absorb the good things from the embryonic state. For example, coal smoke. Since humans started using coal, they have always let it blow away. Who knows how much has been blown away! The semiconductor "germanium" is extracted from coal smoke. From embryos, even more things can be developed. For example, this (Guo Lao points to his hearing aid) is made using semiconductors. When we study folk literature, we must also extract, absorb, synthesize, and create in this way. In this way, we will have a broad world to walk in.

III. What is the value of folk literature for scientific research? Please take history as an example to share your thoughts.

Answer: Folk literature has a great role as historical material. Some relatively reliable folk songs in ancient books, although few, are very valuable because they are first-hand materials, pure materials, not ones that have been tampered with. Its value lies precisely in its "first-handedness."

For example, in chemical analysis, when analyzing water, it must be pure water, distilled water, to get the result of H2O. It is not acceptable to just get a cup of messy water from a pond.

When Marx was forty years old, he started learning Russian to study the economic development of Russia. Why? Because he wanted to read first-hand materials directly in Russian.

China's Twenty-Five Histories, except for one or two, have all been "imperially authorized." These are all piles of historical materials, and it takes an unknown amount of time to finish reading them, and one will not remember them even after reading them. But is it reliable? Only heaven and ghosts know! Of course, there are also good ones, such as Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian." Sima Qian himself was a remarkable figure. He summarized Chinese history before the Han Dynasty and opened up the historical record of the feudal era after the Han Dynasty. I think Sima Qian's greatness is no less than that of Confucius. Sima Qian's point of view was against the rulers, so the historical materials provided by the "Records of the Grand Historian" are more valuable than the "Book of Han," and later historians were even more self-eulogizing. But the "Records of the Grand Historian" also has shortcomings, mainly because it is the work of one person, and what he saw was limited. In addition, there were many forgeries in ancient times, and Sima Qian's work on identifying forgeries was not thorough enough. To study ancient times, the work of identifying forgeries is indispensable. The work of textual research cannot be completely denied. What is the work of textual research? It is to find reliable research materials.

From this point of view, folk songs and ballads are very valuable. Although the folk songs and ballads in ancient books have been recorded by scholars, and "the words change after being passed down three times," they still have some flavor of folk songs and ballads, and they reflect the views of the people, which is more reliable than the records of historians. In some respects, it is even more reliable than the things excavated underground. Written things unearthed underground, especially things like epitaphs, are all words of flattery. You wouldn't scold someone when writing an epitaph for them, would you?

Looking at the "Book of Songs," many materials useful for studying history can be found in "Guo Feng," because it is a folk song, "Xiao Ya" is a little worse, and "San Song" is even less.

IV. Some people believe that the value of folk literature lies mainly in the literary aspect, while others believe that the value of folk literature lies mainly in the scientific aspect. In your opinion, which should be the main focus?

Answer: From the perspective of literary research, it is excellent material; from the perspective of scientific research, it is also excellent material. People who study literature can focus on its literary value; people who study science can focus on its scientific value. Each can have its own focus. There is no Qin Shi Huang who can make it conform to one standard.

V. Regarding the attitude and methods of collection and organization, some emphasize the need for faithfully recorded materials; others emphasize the need for processing and polishing. What do you think should be done?

Answer: Preserving the original material is necessary, and adding modification is also necessary. The two can coexist.

From the perspective of scientific research, there must be faithful original material. Especially for those who study linguistics, if you change the material, they have no way to study it. Scientific research must emphasize the "first-handedness" of the material. At the same time, to process it well, there must also be reliable materials. Faithful original records are the basis of the work. Original materials should be preserved in large quantities.

But from a literary point of view, processing is also very important. Those of us with some experience know that poetry can definitely turn stone into gold! Changing a word can bring a poem to life. "Tui Qiao" (pushing and knocking) is a famous example. Changing a word gives the whole poem sound. Taking the "Book of Songs" as an example, there is no doubt that "Guo Feng" has been deleted and polished. "Guo Feng" has a very strange phenomenon: it is something from more than two thousand years ago, when transportation was so inconvenient, it covered such a wide range—including the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Huai River basins, so many countries, but the rhyme is consistent, and the form is roughly the same four-character form. It must have been unified by Confucius or his disciples. We see that the "lost poems" quoted in some philosophical books are not so neat. The work of the "Book of Songs" is still commendable, but unfortunately, those original records cannot be found. But today we still need many large and small Confuciuses.

Organizing and polishing folk songs is also helpful for promoting standard pronunciation. Folk literature is created in dialects, and dialects have a certain life, but they are not immutable. Now transportation is so convenient. It only takes a few hours to get from Beijing to Moscow! In the past, it was really hard to get from Guangdong to Beijing, but now it is so convenient! Now collective life has also greatly expanded, and the people of various regions have exchanged extensively, so dialects will naturally change. The dialect part of folk literature will also change, and this point cannot be viewed too rigidly.

VI. Some people engaged in folk literature have doubts about the new ballads that are currently emerging, especially the works of workers, feeling that they are not very similar to traditional ballads in form, and they are not the same in terms of production and dissemination. Some are written with a pen, not sung or spoken, and some have not been widely circulated among the masses... Therefore, they hesitate in the face of these works and dare not act. Do you think they are right?

Answer: Everything develops with the times, and ballads are the same. Although it has a tradition, it is constantly breaking the tradition and creating new forms. You can't use a rigid yardstick to apply. The view of first defining and then doing things according to the definition is idealism. First taking a yardstick to apply is metaphysics.

In the future, who wrote the folk song, who sang or wrote it for the first time, can all be found out. The authors of past folk songs were nameless heroes, and the authors of future folk songs will be famous heroes.

Of course, there are many complex issues in new folk songs that need to be studied, but there is no need to worry too much. Do not rigidly apply what is said in books, but go to study living phenomena.

Good things will naturally spread, so don't worry about it. But from today's point of view, if there are good things that have not spread, then we have the responsibility to make them spread, and we must use various methods to make them spread. For example, the current large-scale collection movement is also a method to make folk songs and ballads circulate throughout the country and to future generations. The best works must also cross borders and spread to the world.

Previous history was natural development, and later history—especially under the socialist system—is conscious development. Good things must be done in a planned way and on a large scale. We must be promoters.

Anyone who hesitates to collect shows that there is a problem with the road they are taking. Maybe they also have some "reason," but that is "reason" on another road. -- "The way they speak of, is not the way that I mean."

We are taking the road of socialism, using a faster, better, and more economical method to collect and promote folk songs and ballads. "Hesitation" is not allowed, we must go all out!

    关于大规模收集民歌问题
    郭沫若答“民间文学”编辑部问
    4月14日，中国民间文艺研究会“民间文学”编辑部访问了郭沫若同志，向他提出关于民歌——民间文学的价值、作用及收集、整理等方面的问题，郭沫若同志谈了他的看法。
    一　目前收集民歌的运动正在蓬勃开展，您对于这件事有些什么看法？
    答：这是很好的事。中国收集民歌，是有传统的。古时代有所谓“采风”的制度。“诗经”三百篇，里面大部分都是民歌。历代都有较好的文人做过这件事。现在党把这件事抓起来了，这就太好了。从前大家对于民间的东西不注意，文艺杂志上根本不登旧体诗，不登民间的东西，对它是鄙视的。我在1930年左右，还是在日本的时候，曾经在陶晶孙编的“大众文艺”上写过一篇文章，提倡文艺要重视民歌民谣，音乐要重视打锣打鼓，是挨了骂的！毛主席对民间的东西一向很重视。延安文艺座谈会以后，扭秧歌，不是就敲锣打鼓了吗？现在党把收集民歌抓了起来，各省各县都动了起来，这就会出现一个从来没有过的局面。孔子删诗，一共三百多篇，我们将来收集到的东西，不知道会有多少亿首！现在的搜集工作是由群众来做的，各地都会出许多大大小小的孔夫子。
    群众收集，是很好的。但是也要有些专业的人。民研会可以有重点地搞几个分会，各地都有几个专门搞这个工作的人。现在各地都把收集到的民歌先印成资料本，这是很好的办法。民间文艺研究会应该在各地的基础上做一点事。应该根据各地的资料精选一下，研究研究当中的问题。今年六月里要开一个民间文学工作者大会，很有必要。如果每隔一个阶段，比如每一个五年计划，编出一本真正是最好的民歌，在内容大体上差不多的各首当中选出一首最好的，合在一起，有三百首左右，成一本新的“国风”，那就是了不得了！
    民歌对于鼓舞、教育、组织群众的作用是很大的，它又的确是很优美的文学作品。你们编的那两个资料本（中国民间文艺研究会为编选“农村大跃进歌谣选”和“工矿大跃进歌谣选”第一集曾印出两本资料集）我看了一下，里面有很好的东西。僮族的那首“山南、山北”就很好（按，郭老指的是这一首：“哥住山南红梅庄，妹住山北桃花村，想唱山歌叫哥听，高山挡住不透音；想采鲜花送给哥，翻山越岭人人问。今年成立高级社，山南山北一家人，早晚能见情哥面，心里话儿听得真”）。
    少数民族的民歌应该注意。像“国风”那样的东西，在少数民族的民歌中很多。这跟他们的生活有关系。汉族宋以后受了二程夫子、朱夫子的影响，思想上受了束缚，把创造性弄掉了一些，现在思想解放开来，会出现好东西的。
    大跃进的歌谣要收集，古代的东西也不要丢掉，这些东西也是很有价值、很有意义的。
    收集工作展开了，研究工作要跟上去。像比较比较各省各县的、少数民族和汉族的、这个民族和那个民族的民歌有什么不同，有什么特点，就是应该研究的题目。
    二　收集民间文学对于繁荣创作、创立民族风格有什么作用？
    答：中国现代的作家对于本民族的传统，接受得很差。艾青，还有胡风那些人的一套，都是从外国学来的，老百姓不能接受。
    从文学史上看，一种新的体裁出现，都是民间文学走在前头。中国的诗，很长时期都是四言的。五言诗到建安、正始的时候才固定下来，但是民歌里已经先有了。七言诗的产生更迟，三国时代大都是五言诗，只有曹丕写过一首较好的七言诗。但是七言在民间歌谣谚语里早就有了，“后汉书”里引了许多民间谣谚，大都是七言的。
    民歌的好处是天真、率直。这是很值得诗人学习的地方。从来的文学创作大体上可分为两派。一派是把眼前景色脱口说出，像“池塘生春草”，这是多好的诗！再有一派是修饰的。修饰也有好的，但是修饰得不好的也很多。王国维把它叫做“隔”与“不隔”。真正的名家年轻时大都从平易出发，经过修饰，再归于平易，即不隔——隔，再到不隔。这就是所谓“经过点化后的自然”。真正好的诗都是这样一派。学习民歌，对于创立朴素自然的风格很有好处。
    民间文学是源还是流？我说：在旧时代是源，在新时代是源也是流。在旧时代，因为文化水平的限制，人民自己不能写作，只能口头哼哼。有一些好的文人从人民口头找到一些胚胎状态的东西而加以记录，这样口头作品才能借此流传下来，也从而发展下去。今天，人民有文化了，从人民当中会产生屈原这样的人。但是民间业余的作者有他自己的本行，他有时兴之所至，创作出了作品，有内容，有一定的水平，也还需要专业的文人来发展、加工。群众业余创作提高了，专业作家的水平也就会得到提高，这就叫做“水涨船高”嘛！在和民间的、群众业余的创作结合以后，将来的作家的创作就会比现在的更加波澜壮阔，丰富多采。
    从历史上看。“诗经”绝大部分是民间作品，可以查得出有作者姓名的不上二十篇，但即拿“国风”来说，也是经过删改、润色的。楚辞中屈原的二十五篇，除了“卜居”、“渔父”，以及“九章”中的若干章，基本上是一个人作出来的，是一个笔调，一个感情。而屈原的作品，大家都知道，是吸取了民歌的风格，在民歌的基础上发展起来的。
    楚辞的产生，是在从奴隶社会到封建社会的过渡时期——这一点别位历史学家还有不同的意见，这是一个意识形态大革命的阶段，很有点像现在，会产生大哲学家，也会产生屈原这样的大诗人。到今天为止，屈原还是中国历史上最伟大的诗人，中国还没有一个诗人超过他的水平。
    中国的民间文学非常丰富，但我们不能满足于丰富的矿藏了事，要从胚胎状态的东西把好东西提炼出来，加以吸取。比如煤烟，人类自从用煤以来，一直是让它吹掉，这里面不知吹掉多少东西！半导体的“锗”就是从煤烟里提出来的。从胚胎中更可以发展出很多东西，比如这个（郭老指出他的助听的小机器）也就是利用半导体制造出来的。我们学习民间文学，也要这样提炼、吸取、综合、创造。这样，我们就有了广阔的天地可走。
    三　民间文学对于科学研究有些什么价值？请以历史学为例，谈谈您的看法。
    答：民间文学作为历史资料来看，作用很大。古书上有些比较可靠的民间歌谣，虽然不多，但很可贵，因为它是第一手的资料，纯粹的资料，不是经过窜改的。它的可贵，正是由于它的“第一手性”。
    比如化学分析，分析水，总要是纯粹的水，蒸溜水，才能得出H2O的结果，随便从一个池塘里搞来一杯乱七八糟的水是不行的。
    马克思四十岁为了要研究俄罗斯的经济发展，开始学俄文。为什么呢？因为要直接从俄文读到第一手的材料。
    中国的二十五史，除一两种外都是“钦定”过的。这都是一大堆史料，不晓得要多少时候才读得完，读完了也不会记住。然而它可靠吗？这真是只有天晓得，鬼晓得！自然，也有好的，如太史公的“史记”。太史公本人是个了不起的人物，他总结了汉以前的中国历史，并创开了汉以后封建时代的历史记载的局面，我认为太史公的伟大不下于孔夫子。太史公的观点是反统治者的，所以史记所提供的史料比汉书可贵，后来的史官更是自桧而下了。但是史记也有缺点，主要的原因是一个人的作品，所见有所限制；加以古代的东西作伪的不少，太史公的辨伪工作还没有做到家。要研究古代，辨伪的工作是不可少的。考证工作，不能一概否定。考证工作是什么呢？就是要找可靠的研究材料。
    从这一点讲，民歌民谣就很可贵了。古书上的民歌民谣虽然也经过了文人的记录，“话经三传，就要变样”，但是它究竟都还有点民歌民谣的味道，它反映了人民的看法，比史官的记载要可靠得多。从某一方面讲，甚至比地下发掘的东西还可靠。地下发掘的有文字的东西，特别像墓志铭之类，都是些恭维的话——你给一个人写墓志铭，总不会把他臭骂一通吧？
    从“诗经”看，“国风”里可以找到很多对于研究历史有用的材料，因为它是民歌，“大小雅”就差一点，“三颂”就更少了。
    四　有人认为民间文学的价值主要在于文学方面，有人认为民间文学的价值主要在于科学方面，您看究竟应以何者为主？
    答：从文学研究来看，是很好的资料；从科学研究来看，也是很好的资料。研究文学的人可以着眼在其文学价值方面；研究科学的人可以着眼在科学价值方面。可以各有所主，没有一个秦始皇可以使它定于一尊。
    五　在搜集、整理的态度、方法上，有人强调要有忠实记录的资料；有人强调要加工润色，您看应当如何？
    答：保留原始材料是必要的，再加修改也是必要的，两者可以并行不悖。
    从科学研究来看，必须有忠实的原始材料。特别是研究语言学的，你把材料给他改了，他就没有办法研究了。科学研究，要强调材料的“第一手性”。同时为了很好地加工，也要有可靠的材料。忠实的原始记录是工作的基础。原始材料应该大量保存。
    但是从文学观点上来说，加工也很重要。我们有点经验的人都知道，诗，硬是可以点石成金的嘛！改一个字，诗就活了。“推敲”就是很有名的例子。改一个字，全诗就有了声音。拿“诗经”来说，“国风”毫无问题是经过删改，加过润色的。“国风”有个很稀奇的现象：这是两千多年前的东西，那时交通那么不方便，它包括的范围那么广——包括黄河、长江、淮河三个流域，国家那么多，可是用韵却是一致的，形式上也大致都是一样的四言。这是一定经过孔夫子或者还有他的门人整齐划一过的。我们看一些子书里引的“逸诗”，就不是那么整齐。“诗经”的工作仍是值得称赞的，可惜那些原始记录是没有办法找到了。但我们今天也还需要许多大大小小的孔夫子。
    把民歌整理润色一下，对于推行标准音也有好处。民间文学是用方言创作的，方言有一定的生命，但是也不是一成不变。现在交通这样方便，从北京到莫斯科几个钟头就到了！从前从广东到北京，真是要吃尽千辛万苦，现在多方便！现在集体生活也大大扩充了，各地人民来了个大交流，方言自然要变。民间文学的方言部分也会发生变化，这一点也不能看得太死。
    六　有的搞民间文学的人对目前产生的新歌谣，特别是工人的作品颇有疑虑，觉得它形式上不大像传统的歌谣，在产生、流传上也不大一样，有的是拿笔写出来的，不是唱出来、说出来的，有的还没有广泛地在群众中流传开……因此他们在这些作品面前踌躇起来，不敢下手，您看他们有道理吗？
    答：一切都是随着时代发展的，歌谣也是一样。它虽然有个传统，但时时打破传统，创造出新形式。不能拿一个硬尺度来套。先把定义定下来，按定义办事，这种观点是唯心论。先拿个尺度来套，是形而上学。
    将来民歌是哪个人作的，最初是哪个人唱出来、写出来的，都可以查得出来的。过去的民歌作者是无名英雄，将来的民歌作者会是有名英雄。
    当然，新民歌是有许多复杂的问题需要研究的，但是不必顾虑太多。不要用书上说过的话来硬套，而要去研究活生生的现象。
    好的东西，它自然就会流传开的，你不要替它耽心。但从今天来说，假如有好的东西还没有流传开，那我们就有使它流传开的责任，而且要用各种各样的方法来使它流传开。比如目前的大规模采集运动也就是一种方法，要使民歌民谣向全国流传，向后代流传。最好的作品一定还要超过国界，向世界流传。
    以前的历史是自然发展，以后的历史——特别是在社会主义制度下，是自觉发展。好事一定要有计划的来做，大规模的来做。我们要做促进派。
    谁在踌躇不肯收集，那就表明他走的道路有问题。可能他们也有些“道理”，但那是另外一条道路上的“道理”。——“道其所道、非吾所谓道也”。
    我们是走社会主义的道路，用多快好省的方法来采集和推广民歌民谣，不仅不允许“踌躇”，一定要鼓足干劲！
