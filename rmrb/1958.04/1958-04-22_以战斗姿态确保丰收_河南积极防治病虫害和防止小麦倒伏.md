    Ensuring a Bumper Harvest with a Combat Stance
    Henan Actively Prevents and Controls Pests and Diseases and Prevents Wheat Lodging

    (Report from this newspaper) Henan Province is actively preparing to prevent and control wheat blossom midges. This year, the area affected by wheat blossom midges in Henan Province is widespread, covering sixty-one counties (cities) with an area of 21 million mu. Among them, 9 million mu are severely affected, with more than 20 blossom midges per square foot. According to soil testing in various regions, a large number of blossom midges have risen to the topsoil and are beginning to pupate. Currently, the climate is suitable for blossom midges to pupate and emerge, and it is expected that most of the blossom midges will emerge from the soil around April 23. At that time, the wheat will be heading, coinciding with the emergence of the blossom midges, which is a favorable time for prevention and control.

    Wheat blossom midges cause great harm to wheat, and affected wheat generally reduces yields by 20% per mu. In order to reduce this loss and ensure a bumper wheat harvest, the Xinyang, Shangqiu, Xinxiang, and Luoyang regions of Henan have convened special meetings to make arrangements and have established blossom midge prevention and control headquarters to guide this work. Counties with blossom midges have also conducted technical training. In terms of pesticides, the province has supplied 38.88 million jin of 666 powder for the prevention and control of blossom midges, and more than 95% has been transported to the prevention and control areas.

    (Report from this newspaper) This year, wheat is generally growing well in various parts of Henan Province. In most areas, the wheat has already headed and is beginning to flower, and a bumper harvest is highly anticipated. However, according to recent information, some high-yielding wheat is beginning to show signs of weak stems and a tendency to lodge. In Yanshi County's Yuetan Commune, 40% of the high-yielding wheat is showing slight lodging, and similar phenomena have been observed in Meng County, Anyang City, and other places. In response to this phenomenon, the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture requires all localities to adapt to local conditions, adopt various measures, summarize the experience of the masses, and do a good job in preventing wheat lodging.

    以战斗姿态确保丰收
    河南积极防治病虫害和防止小麦倒伏
    本报讯　河南省各地正积极准备防治小麦吸浆虫。今年河南省发生小麦吸浆虫的地区很广，有六十一个县（市），面积两千一百万亩。其中，虫害严重的有九百万亩，每方尺有吸浆虫二十个以上。根据各地淘土检查，目前吸浆虫已大批上升表土，开始化蛹。现在，气候正适合吸浆虫化蛹羽化，预计在4月23日前后，大部分吸浆虫要羽化出土。那时，小麦即要露脸，恰当吸浆虫羽化出土，正是防治的有利时机。
    小麦吸浆虫对小麦危害很大，受害的小麦一般每亩都减产二成。为了减少这项损失，保证小麦丰收，河南信阳、商丘、新乡、洛阳等专区都已召开专门会议作了部署，并成立了防治吸浆虫指挥部，指导这项工作。有吸浆虫的县份，也都进行了技术训练。在农药方面，全省供应防治吸浆虫的六六六粉三千八百八十八万斤，95％以上都已运到防治地区。
    本报讯　河南省各地今年小麦普遍生长良好，大部分地区小麦已经打苞抽穗，丰收大有希望。但是，据最近了解，有些丰产麦开始出现有茎秆纤弱欲倒的征象。偃师县岳滩社丰产麦有40％呈现轻微倒伏，孟县、安阳市等地也有类似现象。河南省农业厅针对这种现象，要求各地因地制宜，采取各种办法，总结群众经验，作好防止小麦倒伏的工作。
