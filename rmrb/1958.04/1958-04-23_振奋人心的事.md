　　After finishing the "Tomb Relocation Record", I felt very inspired. The images of new-style peasants, full of spirit and open-mindedness, on the Chaoshan Plain immediately appeared before our eyes. The masses of the entire Chaoshan Plain once lived in an environment where "superstitious customs were quite serious", but now they have done the most thorough thing to break with superstition - relocating tombs. People can see from this activity: in the eyes of the Chaoshan people, the road to happy socialism is sacred and inviolable, even if it is the bones of their own ancestors, they must be asked to move, and a new ethical and moral concept and atheistic thought are rapidly growing in the Chaoshan people, which is very inspiring.

    振奋人心的事
    编完“迁坟记”，心里十分振奋。潮汕平原上一个个精神抖擞、思想开扩的新型农民的形象立刻呈现在我们眼前。整个潮汕平原的群众曾经生活在“迷信风气颇为严重”的环境里，但现在他们却干了最彻底的破除迷信的事——迁坟。人们从这个活动里可以看到：在潮汕人民的眼光里，通往幸福的社会主义的道路是神圣不可侵犯的，那怕是自己祖宗的骨殖，也要请它们搬家，而一种新的伦理道德观念和无神论思想正在潮汕人民身上迅速成长，这是十分使人振奋的事。
