    Orphans Are No Longer Alone: The Factory is My Home
  　Wang Shengmao
    I am an orphan who lost my mother at the age of eight and my father at the age of thirteen. For a time, I was destitute and wandered the streets.
    In 1956, our district established a social welfare production mat factory and took me in. From that day on, I had a home again. I ate and lived in the factory. The factory leaders cared for me like my own parents, teaching me production during the day and literacy in the evening. Every time wages were paid, they helped me arrange my life, setting aside money for food, clothing, and pocket money, and also helping me deposit money in the bank.
    How could a wandering child not be moved by such warmth? So I worked hard to learn production techniques and have now learned to weave mats. I can weave one mat a day and earn about eighteen yuan a month, which is comparable to the weaving skills and wage income of an average adult.

    孤儿不再孤　工厂是我家
  　王盛茂
    我是一个八岁上死了母亲，十三岁上又死了父亲的孤儿，一个时期曾经无依无靠在街头流浪。
    1956年，我们这个区成立了社会福利生产席薄厂，把我吸收进去。打从这天起，我又有了家。吃、住都在厂里。厂里的领导干部像我的亲生父母一样的关怀我，照顾我，白天教我生产，晚上教我学文化。每次发了工资帮我安排生活，除去留下吃饭、穿衣、零花钱外，还帮我把钱存入银行。
    一个流浪儿得到这样的温暖，怎能不感动？于是我就努力学习生产技术，现在已经学会了编席，一天能编一条席子，一个月可得工资十八元左右，和一般成年人编席技术、工资收入不相上下了。
