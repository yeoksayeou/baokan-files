Leaping Forward Measures Specified to Each Rice Paddy
    Daqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Guizhou Implements "Five Fixes to Each Paddy," Achieving Five Major Effects

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Daqiao Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan District, Shibing County, Guizhou Province, has implemented "five fixes to each paddy" (作物, 肥料, 措施, 产量, 工分, zuòwù, féiliào, cuòshī, chǎnliàng, gōngfēn): fixing crops, fertilizer, measures, yield, and work points to each individual paddy field. This has ensured that the cooperative's Great Leap Forward plan takes root in every plot of land and in the minds of every member.

    Initially, when the cooperative management committee "contracted" various production increase targets to the teams based on the cooperative's overall Great Leap Forward plan, the members felt uneasy, as they lacked confidence. In response to this situation, the management committee decided to implement the "five fixes to each paddy." However, a significant number of people disagreed. They argued: "With fourteen or fifteen hundred mu of land in the whole cooperative, when will we ever finish making these determinations?" The management committee organized debates among the members. During the debates, many members used specific examples to illustrate the necessity of the "five fixes to each paddy" and criticized the fear of trouble. Subsequently, the management committee, organized by production team, involved production team leaders, activists, and experienced veteran farmers familiar with the local land conditions to carry out the "five fixes to each paddy."

    The detailed content and specific methods of the "five fixes to each paddy" are as follows: 1. Fix Crops: Determine the varieties of crops to be planted in each paddy field based on the different soil types. 2. Fix Fertilizer: Determine the amount of fertilizer to be applied to each paddy field, specifying the type of fertilizer to be used primarily, the number of applications, the amount of fertilizer to be applied each time, and the timing of application. 3. Fix Measures: Determine the production increase measures that must be taken to fulfill the production increase target for each paddy field, as well as the timing and quality requirements for implementing each measure. 4. Fix Yield: Determine the total yield for each paddy field. 5. Fix Work Points: Determine the work points to be earned after completing each task in each paddy field. After the production teams initially determined the "five fixes," they were reviewed by the cooperative management committee and then submitted to the members of each production team for discussion (each team discussed its own), revision, and finalization. The final "five fixes" targets were then registered plot by plot and printed into booklets, with copies kept by both the production teams and the cooperative management committee for inspection.

    The implementation of the "five fixes to each paddy" by the Daqiao Agricultural Cooperative has already yielded significant results: 1. All cooperative cadres and members have a clearer understanding of how to achieve the Great Leap Forward plan than before, and they are working with greater enthusiasm. 2. The sense of responsibility of the members has been greatly strengthened. If a few members occasionally do not meet the "five fixes" requirements in their work, they can quickly correct them after being pointed out by inspectors. 3. The production potential of each paddy field has been further tapped. The total production targets of eight out of the ten production teams in the cooperative have exceeded the contracted output of the "three guarantees." 4. The chaotic situation of production team leaders arranging work every day and evaluating work points every night has been overcome. 5. Cadres feel that leading production is easier than before and that they can spend more time personally leading production in the fields and leading the masses. (Attached picture)

    跃进措施具体到每丘田
    贵州大桥农业社实行“五定到丘”收到五大效果
    本报讯　贵州省施秉县城关区大桥农业社实行作物、肥料、措施、产量、工分“五定到丘”，使合作社生产大跃进计划在每丘田土和每个社员思想上落脚生根。
    开初，当社管会根据全社大跃进计划，把各项增产指标“三包”到队时，社员们便心慌起来，觉得没有底。根据这种情况，社管会决定搞“五定到丘”。但是，有相当一部分人是不同意的。他们说：全社一千四五百亩田土，哪个时候才定得好呀！社管会组织社员们开展了辩论。在辩论中，很多社员都运用典型事实来说明了“五定到丘”的必要性，批判了怕麻烦的思想。接着，社管会便以生产队为单位，组织生产队长、积极分子和熟悉当地土地情况、有丰富生产经验的老农等参加，进行“五定到丘”。
  “五定到丘”的详细内容和具体定法是：一、定作物，根据不同土壤决定每丘田土应种什么品种的作物。二、定肥料，定下每丘田土应施多少肥，以施什么肥为主，分作几次施，每次各施肥料多少，在什么时候施。三、定措施：定下为完成每丘田土的增产任务而必须采取的增产措施，以及实现每项措施的时间和工作质量要求。四、定产量，定下每丘田土的总产量。五、定工分，定下每丘田土每做完一项工种以后应得的工分。生产队把“五定”初步确定以后，经过社管会审查，再交给各个生产队的社员进行讨论（各队讨论各队的）、修改，最后定案。最后定案的“五定”指标，各个生产队便把它逐丘逐丘地登记起来，印成册子，生产队和社管会各存一份，以便检查。
    大桥农业社实行“五定到丘”已经收到明显的效果：一、全体社干和社员对如何实现跃进计划比以前更加亮堂了，干起活来特别起劲。二、社员们的生产责任心大大加强，少数社员干活偶有不合乎“五定”要求的，经检查员指出后，都能很快纠正。三、进一步挖掘了每丘田土的增产潜力。全社十个生产队就有八个队的定产总量超过了“三包”的包产数。四、克服了以前生产队长天天安排活路、夜夜评工计分的忙乱现象。五、干部们都感到领导生产比以前容易了，能有更多的时间亲自到生产中去领导生产，到群众中去领导群众。（附图片）
