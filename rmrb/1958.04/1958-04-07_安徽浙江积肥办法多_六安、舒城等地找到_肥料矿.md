    Anhui and Zhejiang Have Many Methods for Accumulating Fertilizer
    Liu'an, Shucheng, and Other Places Find "Fertilizer Mines"
    (Our newspaper, Hefei, April 4th) In the past month or so, more than five million people in Anhui Province have been engaged in various fertilizer accumulation and production activities every day, advancing at a high speed of accumulating an average of 900 million dan of fertilizer per day, which is twice as fast as the daily fertilizer accumulation progress in February.

    Farmers in mountainous areas are combining the elimination of the four pests with finding bird droppings, and various places are continuing to carry large amounts of fertile mud in conjunction with water conservancy construction. Rice-producing areas have begun activities such as cutting green grass and replacing walls with soil. Many places have also found riverbeds and sunken villages that have been silted up for thousands of years, obtaining large amounts of fertilizer. A sunken village discovered in Liu'an County can yield more than 20,000 jin of fertilizer. Farmers in Shucheng County have also mined a slope filled with trees during the Three Kingdoms period, turning it into a "fertilizer mine" for farmers.

    While carrying out large-scale fertilizer accumulation, various fertilizer production activities are also widely carried out. More than 26,000 granular fertilizer plants in the province have produced more than 680 million jin of fertilizer. In addition, there are more than 4.95 million cattle tail stoves burning soil fertilizer, and more than 4 million manure ponds and field cellars are composting fertilizer.

    (Our newspaper, Hangzhou, April 4th) Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, has today achieved the annual fertilizer accumulation plan of accumulating 1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu.

    "Dredging big harbors and opening big rivers" is the hub for Haiyan County to obtain a large amount of fertilizer. Vigorously promoting new-style tools is the key to quickly completing the fertilizer accumulation plan. Therefore, in just over ten days, the county dredged and cleaned more than 5,000 large and small rivers and harbors, accumulating more than 400 million dan of river mud fertilizer. The new-style tools promoted include more than 30 types such as double-person double-track mud shakers and mill-style mud lifting machines. By the beginning of April, the county had achieved the modernization of fertilizer accumulation tools, with efficiency generally increasing by four to five times compared to the original "ant moving," and the highest reaching more than ten times.

    安徽浙江积肥办法多
    六安、舒城等地找到“肥料矿”
    本报合肥4日电　最近一个多月来，安徽全省每天有五百多万人投入多种多样的积肥和造肥活动，平均每天以积肥九亿担的高速度向前迈进，比2月份每天的积肥进度快了两倍。
    山区农民正在结合除四害找鸟粪，各地结合兴修水利继续大量挑肥泥，稻产区已开始打青草、拆墙换土的活动。很多地方还找到了千百年来淤塞的河道、陷落的村庄，获得了大量的肥料。六安县发现的一个陷落的村庄，就可挖出肥料二万多斤。舒城县农民把三国时用树木填起的一块坡地也开采出来，成了农民的“肥料矿”。
    在开展大规模积肥的，同时各种造肥活动也广泛开展起来。全省二万六千多个颗粒肥料厂已造肥六亿八千多斤。此外还有四百九十五万多个牛尾灶正在烧土肥，四百多万个粪池、田头窖等正在沤肥。

    本报杭州4日电　浙江省海盐县今天已经实现了每亩积足千担肥的全年积肥计划。
    “干大港，开大河”是海盐县获得大量肥料的枢纽。雷厉风行地推广新式工具，又是迅速完成积肥计划的关键。因此在十多天内，全县竟车干挖净大小河港五千多条，共积河泥肥四亿多担。推广的新式工具有双人双轨摇泥机、推磨式提泥机等三十多种，到4月初，全县已经达到积肥新式工具化，效率一般比原先的“蚂蚁传”提高四倍到五倍，最高的达十多倍。
