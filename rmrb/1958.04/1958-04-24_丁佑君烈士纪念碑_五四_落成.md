Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd April. The people of Wutongqiao City, Sichuan Province, are building a memorial to Martyr Ding Youjun. This memorial will be completed on this year's "May Fourth" Youth Day. A bust of the martyr will stand on the top of the monument. The front of the monument will be inscribed with an inscription written by Vice Chairman Zhu De, and the back will contain a brief introduction to the martyr's life. Vice Chairman Zhu De's inscription reads: "Comrade Ding Youjun was a good daughter of the Party and the people, and a good example for Communist Youth League members and young people. Chinese youth should learn from her high degree of class consciousness and revolutionary spirit in dedicating everything to the Party and the people."

The youth and the masses of Wutongqiao City have recently launched a widespread "Learn from Ding Youjun" campaign to commemorate Martyr Ding Youjun. Students at Wutongqiao Middle School have staged the play "Ding Youjun," many young people have visited the martyr's family, some factories and mines have launched a competition to "improve production and break quotas to commemorate Ding Youjun," and the city's Young Pioneers have launched an activity to "do something beneficial for Sister Youjun's memorial."

Martyr Ding Youjun was a nineteen-year-old Communist Youth League member. In 1950, while working in the Yanzhong District of Xichang County, she was besieged and killed by rebellious bandits. At that time, she refused the threats and enticements of the bandits, endured the bandits' torture and humiliation, and remained steadfast. Before being killed by the bandits, she shouted the slogan "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party." After her sacrifice, the local CCP organization, based on her request before her death, posthumously recognized her as an official member of the CCP.

    丁佑君烈士纪念碑“五四”落成
    新华社成都23日电　四川省五通桥市的人民正在为丁佑君烈士建立一座纪念碑。这座纪念碑将在今年“五四”青年节落成。碑的上面竖立着烈士的半身铜像，正面刻有朱德副主席的亲笔题词，背面刻有烈士生平的简略介绍。朱德副主席的题词是：“丁佑君同志，是党和人民的好儿女，是共青团员和青年的好榜样。中国青年应该学习她把自己的一切都献给党和人民的高度阶级觉悟和革命精神”。
    五通桥市的青年和广大群众，最近普遍展开了“学习丁佑君”的活动来纪念丁佑君烈士。五通桥中学的学生排演了话剧“丁佑君”，许多青年访问了烈士的家属，有的厂矿展开了“搞好生产，突破定额，纪念丁佑君”的竞赛，全市少先队员还开展了“为佑君姐姐修建纪念碑做一件有益事”的活动。
    丁佑君烈士是一个十九岁的青年团员，1950年她在西昌县盐中区工作时，被暴乱土匪围攻杀害。当时，她拒绝了土匪的威胁、利诱，受尽了土匪的酷刑和侮辱，仍坚贞不屈，在被土匪杀害前还高呼“中国共产党万岁”的口号。她牺牲后，当地中共党组织根据她生前的请求，追认她为中共正式党员。
