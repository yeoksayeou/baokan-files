    Just Taken the First Step
    Zeng Zhi
    It is indeed gratifying that intellectuals who have been sent to the countryside for labor training, after several months of labor, have gone from being "unable to carry on their shoulders or lift with their hands" to being able to carry and lift; from only knowing how to eat and dress, and not knowing where food and clothing come from, to understanding that "every grain of rice and every thread of clothing is hard-earned." This change shows that these intellectuals have taken the first step in self-reform.

    Having taken the first step, the next should be the second, the third... Only by constantly moving forward can we reach the peak of being both red and expert. This is the demand of every intellectual sent to the countryside, and it is what every intellectual should strive for.

    Unfortunately, a few intellectuals, after taking the first step, having initially learned some labor skills, and gaining some ideological understanding, become proud and complacent, feeling that they have reformed almost completely.

    This cannot but remind us of the story of the tortoise and the hare. Pride will inevitably lead to falling behind; even the fast-running hare will fall behind the crawling tortoise. Moreover, in terms of the skills learned from participating in agricultural labor and the ideological gains made, these comrades are far from being comparable to the fast-running hare, because they are only "beginners" and cannot be called "proficient"! Furthermore, even if they become familiar with agricultural production in the future, have learned a set of agricultural labor skills, understand some agricultural production techniques, and have relatively thoroughly reformed their bourgeois stance, viewpoints, thoughts, and feelings, and have reached the requirement of being both red and expert, there is nothing to be proud of. This is just learning some knowledge of the struggle for production and knowledge of class struggle from practice, and transforming themselves from semi-intellectuals into complete intellectuals. The entire road of self-reform has not been completed; they must become even redder and more expert.

    The intellectuals who have been sent to the countryside have now only initially learned some labor skills and have gained some ideological understanding, but they are still far from reaching the hall. To enter the hall of the working class and the room of socialism, they must transform their original non-working-class stance into the working-class stance; transform their bourgeois thoughts and feelings into the thoughts and feelings of the working people; and transform their bourgeois viewpoints and methods of viewing and analyzing problems into the viewpoints and methods of the working class. Therefore, the intellectuals who are participating in labor training must labor honestly and diligently, and learn from the peasants with an open mind, learning the peasants' labor skills and learning the peasants' excellent qualities. Only in this way can they truly be transformed after a considerable period.

    只是迈开了第一步
    曾志
    下放到农村进行劳动锻炼的知识分子，经过几个月的劳动，由“肩不能挑、手不能提”到又能挑又能提；由只知吃饭穿衣，不知衣食从何而来，到体会到“一粥一饭来之不易”，的确是一件可喜的事。这个变化表明这些知识分子已经迈开了自我改造的第一步。
    迈开了第一步，紧接着应该是第二步、第三步……，只有不停地前进，才能够达到又红又专的顶峰。这是每个下放的知识分子的要求，也是每个知识分子所应该努力的。
    可惜的是，有少数知识分子在走完第一步，初步学会了一些劳动本领，思想上稍有所获的时候，就骄傲自满起来，觉得自己已经改造得差不多了。
    这不能不令人想起龟兔赛跑的故事。骄傲必然要落后，就是善跑的兔子，也会落在爬行的乌龟的后面。何况，从参加农业劳动所学得的本领来说，从思想上所得到的收获来说，这些同志还远不能和善跑的兔子相比拟，因为他们仅仅是“初通”还称不起“善（擅）长”呢！而且，即使将来对农业生产已经熟悉了，已经学会了一套农业劳动的本领，懂得一些农业生产技术，资产阶级的立场、观点、思想感情已经得到了比较彻底的改造，已经达到了又红又专的要求，也没有什么值得骄傲的地方。这不过是从实践中学到了一些生产斗争知识和阶级斗争知识，把自己由半知识分子变成一个完全的知识分子。整个自我改造的道路并没有走完，还要更红更专。
    下放的知识分子，现在只是初步学会了一些劳动本领，思想上有了一些收获，但离登堂入室还远得很。要登工人阶级的堂，入社会主义的室，就要把原来的非工人阶级的立场改造成为工人阶级的立场；把资产阶级的思想感情改造成为劳动人民的思想感情；把资产阶级看问题、分析问题的观点、方法改造成为工人阶级的观点、方法。因此，正在参加劳动锻炼的知识分子必须老老实实、勤勤恳恳地劳动，虚心地向农民学习，学习农民的劳动本领，学习农民的优良品质。只有这样，在经过相当一段时期后，才能够真正得到改造。
