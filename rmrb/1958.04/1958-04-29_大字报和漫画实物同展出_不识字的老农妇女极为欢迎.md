    Big-Character Posters and Actual Cartoons Exhibited Together
    Greatly Welcomed by Illiterate Old Peasants and Women
    (Our Report) A big-character poster exhibition with accompanying cartoons and physical objects in Gan County, Jiangxi Province, has been welcomed by old peasants and women. The exhibition in Huangjin Township, Gan County, features more than 40 big-character posters, which are part of the big-character posters put up by members of the six cooperatives in the township during the "Double-Anti" movement. Most of these big-character posters are accompanied by cartoons drawn by primary school teachers, and some also have physical objects on display, such as damaged farm tools, waterwheels, and seeds. Three junior high school graduates who have returned to their hometown to participate in production take turns serving as narrators for these exhibits. Xue Xueqi, a member of the Huangjin Cooperative, wrote a big-character poster titled "Peanut Seeds Complain," exposing the fact that the fourth team of the cooperative did not properly store peanut seeds and that they were eaten by mice. The bottom of the big-character poster shows two mice eating peanuts, and next to the big-character poster on a table are the peanut shells that have been eaten by mice. These big-character posters, cartoons, and physical objects form a sharp contrast, making them clear and persuasive.
    The General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Huangjin Township, in view of the fact that more than half of the adults in the township are illiterate, held this big-character poster exhibition, accompanied by cartoons and physical objects, in order to attract more people to participate in this movement.

    大字报和漫画实物同展出
    不识字的老农妇女极为欢迎
    本报讯　配有漫画和实物的大字报展览会在江西赣县受到老农和妇女欢迎。赣县黄金乡展览会有四十多张大字报，是这乡六个社的社员在双反运动中贴出的大字报的一部分。这些大字报大多数配有由小学教师画的漫画，有一部分还有实物陈列，如被损坏的农具、水车、种籽等。三个回乡生产的初中毕业生轮流担任这些展览品的讲解员。黄金社社员薛学淇的一张“花生种诉苦”的大字报，揭露了该社第四组对花生种保管不善、被老鼠吃掉的事实，大字报的下端画着两只老鼠在吃花生，大字报一旁的桌子上便放着被老鼠吃掉的花生壳。这些大字报、漫画和实物形成鲜明的对比，一目了然，很有说服力。
    中共黄金乡总支鉴于全乡的成年人有半数以上的是文盲，便举办了这个大字报展览会，配上漫画和实物，以吸引更多的人投入这个运动。
