Two Plays by Guan Hanqing

This year marks the 700th anniversary of the dramatic creations of Guan Hanqing, the great Yuan Dynasty playwright. The China Peking Opera Theatre recently performed Guan Hanqing's plays "Smartly Executing Lu Zailang" and "The Feast of the Five Lords." Both plays demonstrate the playwright's deep sympathy for the oppressed and kind people, and his hatred for powerful and tyrannical local bullies.

"Smartly Executing Lu Zailang" is performed by the Second Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theatre. It is worth noting that Li Hezeng plays Bao Gong in the *xusheng* role, and Jiang Shiyu plays the villain Lu Zailang in the *xiaosheng* role. Both have made innovations in their singing.

"The Feast of the Five Lords" is performed by the Third Troupe of the China Peking Opera Theatre. The actress Li Huifang was successful in her portrayal of Li. She plays first the *qingyi* and then the *laodan*, and her singing is moving, uniformly and completely expressing the kind character of an oppressed woman, which deeply resonates with the audience.

    关汉卿的两个剧
    今年是元代大戏剧家关汉卿的戏剧创作七百周年。中国京剧院最近演出了关汉卿的剧作“智斩鲁斋郎”和“五侯宴”。这两个剧本，都表现了剧作家对被压迫的善良人民的深刻同情，和他对于权贵恶霸土豪的痛恨。
    “智斩鲁斋郎”由中国京剧院二团演出。值得注意的是李和曾以须生扮演包公，江世玉以小生扮演反派角色鲁斋郎。他们在演唱中都有所创造。
    “五侯宴”由中国京剧院三团演出，女演员李慧芳饰李氏获得了成功。她先青衣后老旦，演唱动人，统一完整的表现了一个受压迫妇女的善良性格，深受观众同情。（甲）
