In the rectification campaign, the Tianjin medical community grasped the key of political and ideological revolution, broke the capitalist medical system that had long existed in the minds of medical personnel, and promoted the great leap forward in hospital work throughout the city. This experience is an important inspiration to medical communities in various regions.

Judging from the materials exposed by many hospitals during the "Double-Anti" movement, the set of systems touted by capitalist countries for running hospitals exists in Tianjin and elsewhere. This system only pursues formal "regularization" and neglects all possible care for patients. It is a concentrated manifestation of capitalist ideology in our country's hospital work. It seriously hinders the progress of medical work.

In the "Double-Anti" movement, there were three situations in various hospitals regarding the solution to this problem: One is like Tianjin and other places, where they truly grasped the key to the problem and solved it relatively well. The second is that most hospitals have exposed a large amount of relevant materials, and the leadership is paying attention to studying solutions. The third is a small number of hospitals where the movement is progressing slowly, and are conducting exposure through airing views and debates. Judging from the current situation, how to truly grasp the ideological problems of the medical community through the many phenomena that have been exposed, adopt a fundamental cure, improve the socialist consciousness of the medical community, and break the shackles of the capitalist hospital system is the key to improving medical work at present.

Without destruction, there can be no construction. Tianjin's experience tells us that only by thoroughly eliminating this kind of thinking among medical personnel and changing the capitalist line in their work can all medical personnel serve the people wholeheartedly. Only by "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism" can we truly achieve diligence and thrift in running health undertakings, thoroughly improve our work, and establish the regularization that the people need, based on the needs of the masses and the current conditions in all aspects.

However, some hospitals rushed to grasp rules and regulations without solving ideological problems. As a result, either they could not formulate them well, or even if they were formulated well, it was difficult to implement them thoroughly. Some hospitals, before the ideological problems were resolved, put forward improvement measures such as setting up simple beds based on the demands of the masses. As a result, some senior medical personnel said that this destroyed the "regularization" of the hospital and would "make hospital work regress by thirty years." Under such an ideological situation, even the best measures that benefit the people are unworkable.

In order to effectively break the capitalist "regularization" thinking in the medical community, in addition to strengthening socialist education for the medical community and launching extensive airing of views, big debates within the hospitals, we should also learn from Tianjin's experience, open the doors of the hospitals, and mobilize service recipients to offer opinions on the hospitals and medical personnel. The process of medical personnel listening to and accepting the opinions of the masses is also a process of deeply accepting mass education. This is very effective in strengthening the mass viewpoint of medical personnel and overcoming capitalist ideology.

    医院工作也要破旧立新
    江浩
    在整风中，天津医务界抓住了政治思想革命的纲，打破了长期存在在医务人员思想中的资本主义的医疗制度，促进了全市医院工作的大跃进。这个经验对各地医务界都是一个重要的启示。
    从双反运动中许多医院揭发的材料来看，标榜资本主义国家办医院的一套制度，在天津有，在其它地方也有。这种制度，只追求形式上的“正规化”，而忽视对病人的千方百计的照顾。它是资本主义思想在我国医院工作中的集中表现。它严重地障碍着医务工作的前进。
    在双反运动中，各地医院对于这个问题的解决，有三种情况：一种是如天津等地那样，他们真正抓住了问题的关键，解决得较好。另一种是大多数医院已大量揭发了有关材料，领导方面正注意研究解决。还有一种是运动开展较慢的少数医院，正在通过鸣放和辩论进行揭发。从目前的情况看，如何透过已经揭发的许多现象，真正抓住医务界的思想问题，采取治本的办法，提高医务界的社会主义觉悟，打破资本主义医院制度的束缚，这是当前改进医务工作的关键。
    不破不立，天津的经验告诉我们，只有彻底破除医务人员的这种思想，改变他们工作中的资本主义路线，才能使全体医务人员全心全意地为人民服务。只有“破资立社”，也才能真正做到根据群众的要求和当前各方面的条件，彻底作到勤俭办卫生事业，彻底改进工作，建立人民所需要的正规化。
    但是，有些医院没有解决思想问题就忙于抓规章制度，结果不是制定不好，就是制定得较好也难以彻底实行。有的医院，在思想问题没有解决以前，根据群众的要求，提出了设立简易病床等的改进措施，于是就有高级医务人员说这破坏了医院的“正规化”，要使“医院工作倒退三十年”。在这样的思想状况下，有再好的有利于人民的措施也是行不通的。
    为了有效地打破医务界的资本主义“正规化”思想，除加强对医务界的社会主义教育，在院内展开大鸣大放、大辩论以外，还应该吸取天津的经验，把院门打开，发动服务对象对医院和医务人员提意见。医务人员听取和接受群众意见的过程，也是深刻地接受群众教育的过程。这对于加强医务人员的群众观点，克服资本主义思想是很有效的。
