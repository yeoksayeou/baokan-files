From our newspaper Changchun, 21st: The Jilin Provincial Party Committee recently held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee, adopting both practical and theoretical approaches to examine the province's implementation of the socialist construction line proposed by the Party Central Committee. The meeting analyzed the current situation and then studied the province's future development of agriculture and local industry.

The meeting believes that the line put forward by the Party Central Committee, to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, has great significance for ensuring the rapid development and early success of China's socialist cause and must be conscientiously implemented. To this end, it is necessary to:

First, launch an ideological liberation movement. On the basis of the ideological emancipation in the rectification campaign, further improve the theoretical level of cadres, so that those cadres who are bound by dogmatism and empiricism can be thoroughly liberated, dare to think boldly about problems, adhere to principles and have originality, and fully develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. Break through those erroneous ideas and unreasonable rules and regulations that shackle the productive forces; establish communist ideology, and establish rules and regulations that can promote the great development of production.

Second, implement a cultural revolution and a technological revolution. Everyone should learn culture, learn technology, and learn science, improve production tools, and reform production technology to better and faster promote the speed of socialist construction.

Third, have the spirit of continuous revolution. After the victorious completion of a task, new tasks must be put forward immediately, so that cadres and the masses always maintain full revolutionary enthusiasm.

In terms of developing agriculture: The meeting believes that in the future, Jilin Province's leadership over industrial and agricultural development should be carried out simultaneously. However, because the proportion of industry in this province is relatively large, and agricultural production has not developed well in the past two years, if agriculture cannot keep up, it will hinder the speed of industrial development. Therefore, under the principle of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, this year it is still necessary to put more effort into the development of agriculture, striving to turn things around in one year, change the situation that agriculture has failed to complete state plans for years, basically change the face within three years, and have a major change within five years. Achieve the grain production targets of the National Agricultural Development Program in seven years, and strive to achieve the "four modernizations" (water conservancy, mechanization, afforestation, and electrification) within five years. It is necessary to seize the mass movement for agricultural tool improvement and agricultural mechanization that has already emerged. The mass movement for agricultural tool improvement should be actively led in order to rapidly improve labor efficiency, and through this movement, guide the masses to learn technology and prepare conditions for agricultural mechanization. However, the work of agricultural mechanization cannot be relaxed. The province's favorable conditions should be fully utilized to achieve agricultural mechanization ahead of schedule. At the same time, attention should be paid to the reform of the farming system and farming technology, and the existing labor and animal power should be brought into play, especially attention should be paid to increasing and protecting livestock. At present, all efforts must be concentrated on doing a good job in spring plowing and sowing, which is the first key to winning a bumper harvest this year.

In terms of developing local industry: The meeting believes that, according to the Central Committee's principle of simultaneously developing central industry and developing local industry, implement the principle of the whole party running industry, all levels running industry, and the whole people running industry. In this way, the enthusiasm of localities and the masses will be further developed, and the development of industry will inevitably be accelerated with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, there is no problem for the total output value of local industry in this province to catch up with the total output value of agriculture in two years. Among the industries run by counties, townships, and communes, the first is to run industries that can directly promote agricultural development. Enterprises with more complex technology and larger investments should be handled by provinces and counties, and pilot projects should be carried out first to gain experience, and then develop. Industries run by townships and communes should be small-scale, comprehensive, and joint enterprises based on townships. The source of funds for local industries is mainly to mobilize the masses to invest. Therefore, in the overall leap forward, attention must be paid to the affordability of the masses, distinguish priorities and urgency, and make unified arrangements.

Finally, the meeting believes that in order to conscientiously implement the socialist construction line, it is necessary to continue to boost revolutionary enthusiasm. The main problem at present is still that many cadres lack sufficient enthusiasm. At the same time, it must be emphasized that plans must "land on all four feet." On the one hand, there must be advanced targets, and on the other hand, exaggeration and false reporting are opposed. Comparing progress should not only compare targets, but also compare measures, compare actions, compare thoughts, compare leadership, establish genuine revolutionary enthusiasm, oppose the bureaucratic air of only talking and not acting, the stagnant air of being content with the status quo, the resentful air of blaming others and not examining oneself, and more solidly and vigorously promote the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.

The meeting requires all cadres to work hard to study theory, especially to study Chairman Mao's works and thought, arm themselves with Marxist theory, and achieve the revolutionary spirit of unstoppable momentum and a high communist ideological style. In this way, the correct implementation of the socialist construction line can be guaranteed ideologically.

    思想要彻底解放　计划要“四脚落地”
    吉林省委常委扩大会议号召更扎实地促进生产大跃进
    据本报长春21日电　中共吉林省委最近召开了常委扩大会议，采取虚实并举的方法，从领导思想上检查了本省贯彻执行党中央提出的社会主义建设路线的情况，分析了当前形势，然后就本省今后进一步发展农业和地方工业作了研究。
    会议认为，党中央所提出的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的路线，对于保障我国社会主义事业的迅速发展和早日成功，具有伟大的意义，必须认真贯彻执行。为此必须：
    第一，开展思想解放运动，在整风运动思想大解放的基础上，进一步提高干部的理论水平，使那些受到教条主义和经验主义的保守思想束缚的干部彻底解放出来，敢于大胆地思考问题，既能坚持原则，又有独创精神，把群众的积极性创造性充分发扬出来，冲破那些束缚生产力的错误思想和不合理的规章制度；树立共产主义思想，建立能够促进生产大发展的规章制度。
    第二，实行文化革命和技术革命，大家都来学文化，学技术，学科学，改良生产工具，改革生产技术，更好更快地促进社会主义建设速度。
    第三，要有不断革命的精神，在一个任务胜利完成之后，马上就要提出新的任务，使干部和群众经常保持饱满的革命热情。
    在发展农业方面：会议认为，今后，吉林省对工业和农业发展的领导应该双管齐下。但是，由于本省工业比重大，近两年来农业生产发展又不够好，如果农业跟不上去，就会妨碍工业的发展速度。因此，在工业、农业发展双管齐下的方针下，今年还必须把更大的力量放在发展农业上，力争一年翻身，改变农业历年完不成国家计划的局面，三年内基本上改变面貌，五年要有一个大的变化。七年实现农业发展纲要粮食生产指标，力争五年内实现四化（水利化、机械化、绿化、电力化）。必须抓紧已经出现的群众性的农具改良运动和农业机械化工作。应该积极领导群众性的农具改良运动，以便迅速提高劳动效力，并通过这个运动引导群众学习技术，为农业机械化准备条件。但也不能放松农业机械化工作。应该充分利用本省的有利条件，提前实现农业机械化。同时，要注意耕作制度和耕作技术的改革，发挥现有的劳力、畜力，特别要注意增殖与保护牲畜。目前要集中一切力量把春耕播种工作作好，这是争取今年大丰收的第一个关键。
    在发展地方工业方面：会议认为，根据中央关于发展中央工业和发展地方工业同时并举的方针，实行全党办工业，各级办工业，全民办工业。这样，地方和群众的积极性将得到更大的发扬，必然会多快好省地加速工业的发展。因此本省地方工业总产值二年赶上农业总产值是没有问题的。在县、乡、社办工业中首先是办可以直接促进农业发展的工业。技术较复杂，投资较大的企业由省、县来搞，应先试办取得经验，然后发展。乡、社办工业以办小型的、综合的、以乡为单位的联合企业为好。地方工业的资金来源，主要是发动群众投资，因此，在全面跃进中，必须注意群众的负担能力，分出轻重缓急，统一安排。
    最后，会议认为，为了认真地贯彻社会主义建设路线，必须继续鼓足革命干劲，当前的主要问题仍然是许多干部干劲不足。同时必须强调计划要“四脚落地”，一方面必须有先进指标，另方面也反对浮夸虚报现象。比先进不仅要比指标，同时要比措施、比行动、比思想、比领导，树立真正的革命干劲，反对动口不动手的官气、安于现状的暮气、怨天尤人不检查自己的怨气，更扎实有力地促进工、农业的大跃进。
    会议要求所有干部都要努力学习理论，特别是学习毛主席的著作和思想，把自己用马克思主义理论武装起来，做到有势如破竹的革命气概，有高度的共产主义思想风格。这样，才能从思想上保证社会主义建设路线的正确执行。
