Removing the "Low Yield" Label from Soybeans
The Experience of the "May First" Cooperative in Suihua County in Transforming Soybeans into High-Yield Crops
By Our Reporter Ma Xinren

The "May First" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Caijia Township, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, through intensive cultivation, is transforming the "low-yield" crop of soybeans into a high-yield one. In 1955, the "May First" Cooperative planted over 1,200 mu of soybeans, with an average yield of 180 jin per mu. In 1956, they planted over 1,900 mu, with an average yield of 306 jin per mu. Last year, they planted over 2,200 mu, with an average yield of 287 jin per mu; among which 165 mu yielded 400 jin of soybeans per mu. In contrast, the average soybean yield in Heilongjiang Province last year was 149 jin per mu.

Why are soybeans, which have always been perceived as "low-yield" and "unstable-yield," both stable and high-yielding in the "May First" Cooperative? The soybeans are the same soybeans, but the farmers, with the ideological understanding that soybeans can also achieve "high yields," have removed the "low-yield" label from soybeans after putting in various yield-increasing efforts. This year, the "May First" Cooperative's production will also leap forward, but unlike some other agricultural cooperatives preparing for a production leap forward, the "May First" Cooperative is not only relying on high-yield crops for its leap, but the so-called "low-yield" soybeans are also within the leap forward plan. The entire cooperative plans to plant over 2,500 mu of soybeans, with a per-mu yield of over 500 jin, and also cultivate 30 mu of high-yield soybean fields with a unit yield exceeding 660 jin.

Last autumn harvest, many agricultural cooperatives in Caijia Township concentrated their livestock to haul crops; the "May First" Cooperative, while also hauling crops intensively, also dispatched strong horses to pull double-wheeled, single-bottom plows to turn the soil. The land that the cooperative plans to sow with soybeans this year was basically turned over in the autumn. This is one of the technical experiences of the "May First" Cooperative's consecutive three-year soybean harvests. Many people believe that new-style livestock farm implements do not increase soybean production, but the "May First" Cooperative, based on experience and theoretical understanding, believes that using new farm implements to plant soybeans does increase production. Cooperative members say: "One should cherish their own children, and land should be deeply plowed. Old plows can only plow three inches deep, while new plows can plow four or five inches deep, which will inevitably increase production." More importantly, the "May First" Cooperative members pay attention to combining the use of new farm implements with local farming experience and natural conditions. They use new farm implements to flat-sow soybeans and ridge them up when hoeing the first time. The local area has little spring snow and strong spring winds; if the plowed land is all large clods, moisture will evaporate quickly, causing spring drought, which is also why local farmers are reluctant to plow. The "May First" Cooperative adopts the method of plowing and harrowing simultaneously, making the soil very loose and greatly retaining moisture. The cooperative has a clear system to ensure the quality of cultivation. Last spring, Caijia Township organized various cooperatives to visit the "May First" Cooperative's soybean sowing, but the land was not completely leveled to meet the requirements, and the farmer technicians refused to sow until the land was properly prepared.

Not a single soybean sown by the "May First" Cooperative is a bad seed. Not only are the seeds carefully selected before sowing, but more importantly, since 1955, they have established soybean seed fields, personally led by a deputy director. The seed field is fixed in a production team, making it easy to improve cultivation techniques, and the seed field is the most fertile land, with the most fertilizer applied and priority given to hoeing and weeding. In many agricultural cooperatives, there are "Full Granary Gold" fine varieties, but because there are no seed fields, after two or three years, the seeds become mixed and degenerate. The purity of the "May First" Cooperative's "Full Granary Gold" soybean seeds is over 90%, and they are all full, which plays a significant role in increasing production.

The "May First" Cooperative "spares no effort" in soybean sowing techniques and fertilization of soybean fields. Not only is fertilizer applied before sowing, but also after the soybean seedlings emerge, with a per-mu fertilizer application rate twice as high as that of ordinary cooperatives. This year, the fertilizer application rate will be increased by another 100% to 150% compared to last year, and different types and amounts of manure will be applied according to the different fertility and soil quality of each plot and ridge. In the case of Heilongjiang Province, where there is a lot of land and few people, the meticulousness of the "May First" Cooperative's soybean cultivation is no less than embroidery. They have studied the different characteristics of new farm implements sowing and old farm implements sowing of soybeans, and found that flat-sown soybeans have thick soil cover and few root nodules; soybeans sown with old farm implements have less soil cover and are easily exposed to the sun, so they have researched that the plow furrows should be deep, but the ridge platforms should be covered shallowly with soil. In order to improve the hoeing (weeding) and ridging (cultivating furrows and mounding soil onto the ridges) of flat-sown soybeans, they have determined that technicians with high skills should hoe small ridges, and those with low skills should hoe large ridges; horses with small hooves should cultivate small ridges, and horses with large hooves should cultivate large ridges. Most soybeans are thinned twice, while simultaneously removing weeds in the seedling holes to avoid damaging the seedlings when removing seedling hole weeds with large hoes. The women who are responsible for thinning seedlings are all highly skilled. This year, the "May First" Cooperative's soybean planting techniques will be further improved. In addition to reasonable sparse planting, double rows will be sown on large ridges, with the two rows of seedlings kept in a staggered pattern, and corn will be planted at the same time. Chemical fertilizers will also be applied as a top dressing in high-yield fields with experimental characteristics.

At the beginning of this year, when the "May First" Cooperative discussed the production leap forward plan, some cooperative members wanted to plant only high-yield crops, but no one proposed not planting soybeans. This is because, on the one hand, they know the significance of increasing soybean production to support national industrialization, and on the other hand, planting soybeans also has many benefits for themselves. Experienced old farmers all know that land that has grown soybeans has great fertility when planting any other crop. The price ratio between soybeans and corn is about two to one. As long as soybeans have a bumper harvest, the income of farmers will be greatly increased. In 1957, the "May First" Cooperative earned more than 25,000 yuan more due to the soybean bumper harvest than if they had planted corn with the same bumper harvest.

    摘掉大豆“低产”的帽子
    绥化县“五一”社把大豆变为高产作物的经验
    本报记者　马新仁
    黑龙江省绥化县蔡家乡“五一”农业生产合作社，加工种植，正在把“低产”作物大豆，变成高产作物。“五一”社1955年种了一千二百多亩大豆，平均每亩产量一百八十斤。1956年种了一千九百多亩，每亩产量三百零六斤。去年种了二千二百多亩，平均产量是二百八十七斤；其中有一百六十五亩，每亩收了四百斤大豆。而去年黑龙江省全省大豆每亩平均产量是一百四十九斤。
    一向在人们印象中是“低产”又“不稳产”的大豆，为什么在“五一”社既稳且高呢？大豆还是大豆，但是思想上认识大豆也能够“高产”的农民，付出各种增产努力之后，摘掉了大豆的“低产”帽子。今年“五一”社的生产也要跃进，但是和其他一些准备生产跃进的农业社不同的是，“五一”社不光靠高产作物跃进，所谓“低产”的大豆，也在跃进计划以内。全社要种二千五百多亩大豆，每亩产量要达到五百斤以上，而且还要培植出三十亩单位产量超过六百六十斤的大豆高产田。
    去年秋收，蔡家乡很多农业社集中畜力拉庄稼：“五一”社却一面紧张地拉庄稼，一面还抽调壮马套上双轮一铧犁翻地。这个社准备今年播种大豆的土地，基本在秋天翻完。这一点是“五一”社大豆连续三年丰收的技术经验之一。很多人认为新式畜力农具种大豆不增产，而“五一”社根据经验和理论认识，却认为用新农具种大豆增产。社员说：养儿要亲生，种地要深耕，旧犁只能耕三寸深，新式犁能耕四、五寸深，必然会增产。更重要的是“五一”社社员，注意新农具使用和当地耕作经验，自然条件结合。用新农具平播大豆，锄第一遍草的时候起垅。当地春雪少，春风大，翻耕过的土地如果都是大土块，水分会蒸发很快，发生春旱，这也是当地农民不肯翻地的原因。“五一”社采取随耕随耙的办法，土很松，保墒作用很大。这个社保证耕作质量有一套明确的制度，去年春天，蔡家乡组织各社参观“五一”社播种大豆，但是土地平整的不完全合乎要求，农民技术员拒绝播种，一直到土地整好才开种。
    “五一”社播种的大豆，没有一粒是不好的种子。不但播种前粒粒精选。更重要的是从1955年起，就建立了大豆种子田，由一位副主任亲自领导。种子地固定在一个生产组里，便于提高培育技术，而且种子地是最肥沃的地，施肥最多，优先铲趟，杂草及时拔去。在不少农业社里，都有“满仓金”良种，因为没有种子地，两三年后，种子就混杂，退化。“五一”社的“满仓金”豆种纯度在90％以上，而且粒粒饱满，这就在增产上起了很大作用。
    “五一”社在大豆的播种技术和豆田的施肥上都“不惜工本”。不仅播种前施肥，豆苗出土后还要施肥，每亩施肥量比一般社高出一倍。而今年施肥量又比去年增加一倍到一倍半，并且按每块地，每条垅的肥瘠情况，土质情况的不同，上不同种类和不同数量的粪肥。在黑龙江省地多人少的情况下，“五一”社种植大豆的细致，不亚于绣花。他们研究了新农具播种和旧农具播种大豆的不同特点，发现平播大豆培土厚，根瘤少；旧农具种的培土少了容易晒根，就研究出犁垅沟要深，垅台土却又要培的浅。为了提高平播大豆的铲（锄草）趟（耕垅沟和向垅台上培土），确定技术高的趟小垅，技术低的趟大垅；蹄子小的马趟小垅，蹄子大的马趟大垅。多数大豆间两次苗，同时拔掉苗眼草，避免用大锄除苗眼草伤苗。担任间苗的都是技术好的妇女。今年“五一”社种大豆的技术还要提高，除了合理稀植，大垅大豆采取双条播种，两行苗保持犬牙交差的形状，同时间种玉米。带试验田性质的高产田，还要追施化学肥料。
    今年年初“五一”社讨论生产跃进计划的时候，部分社员曾经想只种高产作物，但是没有一个人提出不种大豆。这是因为一方面他们知道增产大豆对支援国家工业化的意义，另一方面种大豆对他们自己好处也很多。有经验的老农民都知道，种过大豆的地，再种其他任何庄稼，地力都很大。大豆和玉米的价格大约为二与一之比。只要大豆丰产，就大为增加农民的收入。“五一”社1957年由于大豆丰产，比同样种玉米丰产，多收入了二万五千多元。
