　　At School
　　Reclaiming Wealth from the Ocean
　　In this spring of the Great Leap Forward in production, the Department of Aquaculture at Shandong University has proposed a leap forward plan of "Conquering Nature and Reclaiming Wealth from the Ocean." Their goals are: to bring the teaching level into balance with the scientific level of domestic industry within five years, and to catch up with the level of Japanese aquaculture science within ten years.
　　In order to implement the policy of combining work and study and running schools diligently and thriftily, starting this year, the breeding farm originally used for teaching practice will be put into production. Through scientific research, they will solve the key problems of production, and increase the output of kelp cultivation from 70 to 120 catties per unit in the original lean sea area to 2,000 to 3,000 catties within five years. The output of pond fish farming will be increased from the original 400 to 500 catties per mu to 2,000 to 3,000 catties per mu within five years. (Yu Xianjie)
　　Marching towards the Wasteland of Nankai Garden!
　　"Reclaiming vegetables, fruits, and grain from the wasteland of Nankai Garden!" This is the battle cry of the teachers and students of the Department of Economics at Nankai University. Professor Yang Zengwu and Mr. Chen Bingfu, who are old and weak, participated in the labor together with everyone. They originally planned to reclaim 34.5 mu of wasteland in seven days, but they completed more than 32 mu in three days.
　　To grow crops, there must be fertilizer. The students went to the toilets to dig out manure pits. This was unimaginable for college students in the past. Now everyone says, "It's dirty and smelly now, but it will be fragrant and sweet in the autumn." Some dug, some carried, and they carried 170 loads in one day. They also rented waterwheels from the peasants and drained water day and night, preparing to dig out the silt from the bottom of the lake to use as fertilizer. (Hu Ti Yun)
　　Educate Children to Protect Young Trees
　　Currently, a vigorous afforestation campaign is underway throughout the country, which is a good thing. However, I have seen many young trees in the city that have been planted not long ago being shaken and broken by children, so that they cannot survive, and they have to be replanted next year, which causes a waste of manpower and material resources; it also delays the afforestation work. Children do not understand the meaning of afforestation. I hope that teachers and parents will educate children to protect young trees. Wang Xueren

    在学校里
    向海洋索取财富
    在这生产大跃进的春天里，山东大学水产系提出了“征服自然，向海洋索取财富”的跃进规划。他们的奋斗目标是：五年内使教学水平与国内工业的科学水平平衡，十年内赶上日本水产科学的水平。
    为了贯彻勤工俭学、勤俭办学的方针，从今年起，把原来供教学实习用的养殖场投入生产。通过科学研究能够解决生产的关键问题，并且使海带养殖在五年内由原瘦海区每台产量七十到一百二十斤达到二千到三千斤。使池鱼养殖在五年内自原产量每亩四百到五百斤达到二千到三千斤。　（余贤杰）
    向南开园荒地进军！
    “向南开园的荒地索取菜果粮食！”这是南开大学经济系师生的战斗口号。年高体弱的杨曾武教授和陈炳富先生同大家一齐参加劳动。原定七天开荒三十四亩五分，他们在三天就完成了三十二亩多。
    种田必须有肥料，同学们就到厕所里挖大便池。这在过去对大学生来说是不可想像的事。现在大家都说：“现在脏又臭，秋后香又甜”。他们有的挖，有的挑，一天就挑了一百七十担。他们又向农民租来了水车，昼夜不停地排水，准备把湖底淤泥挖出来作肥料。　（胡悌云）
    教育儿童爱护幼树
    目前，全国各地正在热火朝天地进行绿化工作，这是一件好事情。但是，我看到城市中许多刚种下不久的幼树就被孩子们摇晃和攀折，以致不能成活，到明年还得重新补种，这就造成人力物力上的浪费；同时也推迟了绿化工作。孩子们是不懂得绿化的意义的，希望教师和家长教育孩子们爱护幼树。　王学仁
