    Instrument for Checking Electrical Wire Lines
    The Model 732 line fault pulse tester, an instrument that can check for the location of faults in electrical wires within 350 kilometers in five minutes, has recently been successfully trial-produced by the Tianjin Municipal Joint State-Private Electronic Instrument Factory. This instrument was designed by the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau. After being appraised by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, it was found to have good performance, high sensitivity, and high accuracy. When a long-distance telecommunications line or cable is broken or has crossed wires that affect the call, the cathode ray tube of this instrument can check the location of the fault point, which is faster and more accurate than manual inspection.

    检查电线线路的仪器
    五分钟就检查出三百五十公里内电线发生障碍的地点的仪器——七三二型线障脉冲测试器，最近已由天津市公私合营电子仪器厂试制成功，这种仪器是太原工程局设计的，经过邮电部鉴定，性能良好，灵敏度和准确度都很高。在长途电讯线路或电缆线断线和混线影响通话的时候，这种仪器的射线管就可以检查出障碍点的位置，比用人工检查的方法又快又准确。
