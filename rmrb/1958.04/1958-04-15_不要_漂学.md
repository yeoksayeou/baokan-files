    Don't "Skim-Study"
    Yang Xianzhen
    "Skim-study" is a local term from my hometown. I'm not sure if "漂" (piāo, meaning "to float") is the correct character, but people often say it. For example, when people criticize an actor whose singing is off-key, they say he's "skim-studying," meaning he hasn't put in the hard work to master his craft.
    Does this "skim-study" phenomenon exist among our teaching staff? I think it does. Some people are unwilling to work diligently and wholeheartedly, only focusing on becoming famous and establishing themselves, content with publishing small booklets that are copied and pieced together from various sources. From a scholarly perspective, this is what the least promising people do. Doing this will absolutely not allow you to cultivate yourself into a teaching staff member with genuine talent and practical knowledge. Doing this will only turn you into an empty "expert" of some kind. And being content with being an empty "expert" is extremely dangerous and foolish.
    There are also some people who are unwilling to put in the hard work in their studies, always wanting to take shortcuts. After reading a few lecture notes and "skim-studying" a little bit, they think they are already remarkable, and their tails are wagging in the sky. Or, they have just written one or two articles, published them in newspapers or periodicals, and then become elated, as if they have passed the imperial examination, become dizzy with success, and become arrogant. This is called "a small container is easily filled." A small earthenware pot doesn't hold much before it's full. In terms of scholarship, this kind of person is also the least promising.
    We hope that all our teaching staff can achieve something in their studies. But "skim-studying" will not lead to any achievement in scholarship.
    We hope that in this anti-rightist campaign, we can sweep away this "skim-study" phenomenon completely.

### 不要“漂学”

    不要“漂学”
    杨献珍
    “漂学”，是我们家乡的一种土语，“漂”，不晓得是不是这个字，但人们常常在口头上说着。例如人们批评一个唱得不合板眼的演员，就说他是“漂学的”，意思是说这个人唱戏没有下过苦工夫。
    这种“漂学”的现象，在我们的教学工作人员中有没有呢？我看是有的。有些人不肯埋头苦干，只是驰心于成名成家，满足于出版一些东抄西抄、七拼八凑的小册子，从做学问方面来说，这是最没有出息的人干的事。这样干，绝对不能把自己培养成为一个具有真才实学的教学人员。这样干，只能使自己成为一种空头的什么“家”。而满足于当一个空头的什么“家”，那是非常危险的，也是非常愚蠢的。
    还有些人做学问不肯下苦工夫、总想走捷路，读了几本讲稿，“漂学”了一点东西，便以为已经了不起，于是尾巴翘到天上。或者刚写了一篇两篇文章，在报纸或刊物上发表了，便飘飘然，像中了状元一样，得意忘形，不可一世。这就叫做器小易盈。小小的瓦罐，装得不多的东西就满了。在做学问上说，这种人也是最最没有出息的。
    我们希望我们所有的教学工作人员，都能够在学问上有所成就。但“漂学”是不会在学问上有任何成就的。
    我们希望在这次双反运动中，把这种“漂学”的现象一扫而空。
