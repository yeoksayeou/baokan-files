Xinhua News Agency, April 16th: Large-scale spring plowing and sowing in rural areas across the country has been widely underway since around the Qingming Festival (April 5th). Currently, most areas in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Sichuan provinces have basically completed early rice transplanting. Provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are busy with rice seedling cultivation, and some areas have begun transplanting. Cotton sowing in provinces of the Yellow River basin is also nearing completion, and provinces in Northeast China are sowing spring wheat.

The intense and busy spring planting is the current focus of rural areas. Early, fast, and good are the characteristics of this year's spring planting.

This year, the national rice planting area will be greatly expanded compared to last year. Southern provinces plan to increase double-cropping rice by more than 40 million mu, and Northern (including Northeast) provinces will add 50 to 60 million mu of new rice fields after constructing water conservancy projects and converting dry land to paddy fields. Most southern provinces have advanced the sowing period for early rice. In the past, Sichuan sowed early rice around the vernal equinox, but this year it began around the Rain Water period. Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, used to soak seeds during Qingming, but this year it sowed them during the vernal equinox. Early rice transplanting in Guangdong Province is about 25 days earlier than in previous years. This year, the promotion of rice seed disinfection, moist seedbeds, and other rapid seedling cultivation methods is more common in various regions. In Hunan Province, 70% of seedbeds are moist seedbeds, thus greatly advancing the transplanting of early rice. This year, close planting has been generally adopted, with row spacing generally being four to six inches, reaching more than 20,000 seedlings per mu. In the north, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and the Northeast have greatly expanded paddy fields this year. Henan plans to expand by 15 million mu. After preparing seedbeds, transferring rice seeds, technical training, and other preparations, they have now begun soaking fields and cultivating seedlings. Liaoning is also actively preparing seeds and land.

This year, the planting area for potatoes has also greatly expanded. According to statistics from seventeen provinces, it has expanded by about 50 million mu compared to last year, with Hebei Province expanding by 12 million mu the most. Sweet potato seedling cultivation has also been greatly advanced. An'guo County, Hebei, began using heated kang beds to cultivate sweet potato seedlings before the vernal equinox. The use of warm beds for early seedling cultivation is also very common in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Sichuan. This year, the planting area for corn will also be expanded in the three northeastern provinces and Shanxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Liaoning plans to expand by 9 million mu. Currently, spring corn has been mostly planted in provinces like Jiangsu, and Hebei and other provinces are sowing. This year, the planting area of hybrid corn has been expanded compared to previous years in spring corn sowing.

The planting area of economic crops has also slightly expanded in this year's spring planting. The cotton planting area will increase by more than 3 million mu compared to last year. Cotton planting in various regions is about ten days earlier than in previous years. Now, most of the major cotton-producing areas across the country have finished planting, and the areas south of Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province have basically finished planting, while the areas north of Shijiazhuang are fighting drought and sowing. Chaoyang and other counties in the cotton-producing areas of Liaoning Province are also irrigating the land in preparation for sowing. More than 50% of the cotton seeds planted this year are high-quality Daizi cotton, and the others are also improved varieties. Various cotton fields have been adjusted to better land. Irrigated cotton fields were only 12 million mu last year, but this year they have reached 37 million mu. Each mu has accumulated about 7,000 to 8,000 jin of fertilizer, fundamentally eliminating the phenomenon of planting cotton without fertilizer.

During this year's spring planting, Hebei, Gansu, Qinghai, and parts of Guangxi, Sichuan, and Guizhou in the south encountered spring droughts. These provinces have mobilized the masses to adopt various methods to carry out drought-resistant sowing.

According to a person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture, this year's spring planting in most parts of the country has been both fast and good, laying the foundation for this year's leap forward in grain and cotton production.

During this year's spring planting, party and government leaders in various regions have divided up battle lines and adopted a contracted responsibility system to command on the front lines. Many counties have adopted the method of working in the fields, mobilizing the masses to carry out field inspections, appraisals, and competitions. Now, the vigorous spring planting movement is still continuing. However, in some individual areas, party and government leaders are still focusing on water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, and have not shifted their main efforts to leading spring planting. The Ministry of Agriculture believes that this phenomenon urgently needs to be corrected, and requires all regions to concentrate their efforts on completing spring planting.

### 为今年农业大丰收打下牢靠基础  又早又快又好播种粮棉  部分地区要赶快把主要力量转到领导春播上来

    为今年农业大丰收打下牢靠基础
    又早又快又好播种粮棉
    部分地区要赶快把主要力量转到领导春播上来
    据新华社16日讯　全国农村大规模的春耕播种，已经在清明节（4月5日）前后广泛展开。现在，广东、广西、四川等省大部分地区已经基本上完成了早稻插秧，长江中下游各省育秧正忙，部分地区已开始插秧。黄河流域各省的棉花播种也已经接近结束，东北各省正在播种春麦。
    紧张而繁忙的春播是当前农村的中心。早、快、好是今年春播的特点。
    今年全国水稻种植面积将比去年扩大很多，南方各省双季稻计划增加四千多万亩，北方（包括东北）兴修水利、旱地改水田后新增水稻面积五、六千万亩，南方各省大都提早早稻的播种期。四川往年春分播种早稻，今年雨水前后就开始了。浙江省嘉兴往年清明浸种，今年春分就播种了。广东省早稻插秧比往年提早约二十五天。今年各地推广稻种消毒、湿润秧田和其他快速育秧法的较普遍，湖南省秧田有70％是湿润秧田。因而大大提早了早稻插秧。今年插秧普遍采取了密植，株行距一般是四寸六寸，每亩达二万多蔸。北方河南、山东、河北和东北今年稻田扩大很多。河南计划扩大一千五百万亩，经过准备秧田，调运稻种，技术训练等等准备，现已开始泡田育秧。辽宁也在积极作种子、整地等准备工作。
    今年薯类种植面积也扩大很多，据十七省统计比去年扩大约五千万亩。其中以河北省扩大一千二百万亩为最多。甘薯的育苗也大大提早了。河北安国县春分前就开始用火炕育甘薯苗。江苏、山东、河南、四川采用温床提早育苗也很普遍。今年的玉米种植面积，东北三省和山西、广东、广西也将扩大。辽宁计划扩大九百万亩。现在，江苏等省春玉米大部种上，河北等省正在播种。今年春玉米播种中，杂交种玉米种植面积比往年扩大了。
    今年春播中经济作物的种植面积也略有扩大。棉花的种植面积将比去年增加三百多万亩。各地种棉都比往年提早了十天左右。现在全国主要棉区大部棉田已经种完，河北省石家庄以南地区已经基本种完，石家庄以北地区正在抗旱播种。辽宁省棉区朝阳等县也在浇地准备播种。今年种的棉种50％以上是优良的岱字棉，其他也是良种。各地棉田都调整了较好的土地。水浇棉田去年仅一千二百万亩，今年达三千七百万亩。每亩积肥都在七、八千斤左右，根本消灭了种棉不施肥的现象。
    今年春播中，河北、甘肃、青海和南方广西、四川、贵州部分地区遇到了春旱。这几个省发动群众采用各种办法展开了抗旱播种。
    据农业部负责人说：今年全国大部分地区，春播既快又好，已为今年粮食、棉花跃进增产打下了基础。
    今年春播中，各地党政领导都划分了战线，采取包干负责办法在前线指挥。不少县采取田间办公的办法，发动群众展开了田间的检查、评比和竞赛。现在，轰轰烈烈的春播运动还在继续。但也有个别地区，目前党政领导仍在抓水利和积肥，没有把主要力量转到领导春播上来。农业部认为这个现象急需纠正，要求各地集中全力完成春播。
