Editorial: Strive by Every Means to Achieve Production Increase Targets

    A mass upsurge of developing agricultural production and building a new socialist countryside is boiling over throughout the country. This upsurge has brought about a new situation of comprehensive upswing in spring plowing production across the country this year. Now, more counties and cities are determined to achieve the "four, five, eight" grain production increase targets and other targets proposed in the Draft National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule. Generally speaking, various regions have also deeply studied and tapped the potential for increasing production, broken with conservative thinking, and formulated relatively high leap forward plans.
    This year, there are more favorable conditions for substantial increases in production. The country's paddy fields and irrigated land area used to be only over 390 million mu, but this year it has newly increased by over 200 million mu. A large number of newly built water conservancy projects ensure that a large amount of farmland can be protected from drought and floods and achieve bumper harvests. There are also a large number of low-lying and saline-alkali land reclamation projects, soil improvement, increased deep plowing and mountain water and soil conservation projects, increased fertilizer application, increased high-yield crops and multiple cropping areas, etc. All of these are very beneficial to this year's agricultural production increase.
    Just as in the revolutionary war period, many people did not believe that powerful enemies at home and abroad could be defeated, since 1956, many people have not quite believed that agricultural production increase targets can be rapidly improved. But ironclad facts have educated people, making them believe that changed relations of production can accelerate the development of productive forces many times over. Things that used to take decades, centuries, or even hundreds of years to accomplish can now be done in a few years or even one or two years. Cooperative production enables the wisdom and creativity of producers to be fully utilized, and output can quickly reach peaks that people find hard to imagine. Chenghai and Chao'an counties in Guangdong, where the average yield per mu was only about 500 jin before liberation, achieved an average yield per mu of 1,000 jin in 1956, and were called thousand-jin counties. This was considered a miracle at the time. Many people could not deeply understand the social roots of the rapid increase in yield per mu, and once asserted that the production of these two counties had reached its peak, not believing that it could continue to increase; they even did not believe that they could maintain the thousand-jin record. However, the facts ignored people's subjective dogmatism and continued to move forward in their own direction. In 1957, the average yield per mu in these two counties leaped to over 1,200 jin. The reason is that under the leadership of the Party, the peasant masses further developed water conservancy, transformed low-yield fields, and promoted advanced cultivation techniques. In the impoverished mountainous area of Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, where the stone was thick and the soil was thin, the average yield per mu of cultivated land before liberation was only about 70 or 80 jin. But even such unfavorable natural conditions did not stop the development of productive forces liberated by the cooperative system. In the agricultural cooperatives led by Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Wu Houli, the targets proposed in the National Program for Agricultural Development have also been achieved and exceeded ahead of schedule, with an average yield per mu of over 400 jin in 1957. According to national statistics, 32 counties and cities achieved the per mu yield targets set by the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule in 1956. By 1957, another 32 counties and cities had achieved this ahead of schedule, for a total of 64 counties and cities.
    At present, the ideological liberation and revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people have greatly exceeded the past two years. Especially the water conservancy movement since last winter has made the people see their own strength from a large number of facts, and see that natural conditions can be changed by people's subjective efforts. This dialectical materialist awakening has made them no longer succumb to the arrangement of fate, no longer resign themselves to fate, but dare to declare war on any huge difficulties. This passionate and vigorous revolutionary spirit will break through all the difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead.
    By deeply recognizing and fully utilizing these many new favorable conditions, we will surely be able to win a substantial increase in production on this year's agricultural front. What is particularly important at present is to continue to mobilize the broad masses of the people to come up with all kinds of specific methods to achieve the formulated production increase plans and advanced targets. Based on the recent activities in various regions, the following aspects are of great significance.
    First, rapidly and universally disseminate and learn from the production increase experiences, new technologies, and new practices of advanced regions, so that the broad masses of peasants can broaden their horizons, constantly receive new inspiration in their thinking, and be able to come up with various new measures. In this regard, many places have already done a lot, but it has not been done very universally. Some backward and remote villages know very little about what is happening elsewhere. Even if they hear something, it is not very specific. These villages have always had very few practical measures to increase production. This situation urgently needs to attract the attention of the leading organs in various places, and actively help them quickly.
    Second, most counties have now formulated many county-wide production increase measures, which is very good. However, some have neglected the specific measures that each township and cooperative should take in light of their own local conditions, and have not combined the unified production increase measures within a large scope with the special production increase measures of each township and cooperative. As a result, some townships and cooperatives have more or less delayed their own special measures because they have to carry out the overall tasks of the county. This situation must be paid attention to. Leading cadres and general staff in each county (city) should go deep into the masses of each township and cooperative to, on the one hand, introduce the production increase experience of other places, and on the other hand, discuss with the masses the production increase measures that are suitable for their own township and cooperative, especially to discuss with experienced old peasants. As long as the enthusiasm of the masses can be mobilized, such measures suitable for the local area can definitely be found.
    Third, the leading cadres and staff of the county should go deep into the masses of each township and cooperative to understand the situation, discover the actual problems and obstacles in the implementation of the production increase plan, unite the activists and the broad masses, and jointly solve these practical problems and overcome these obstacles. There are problems in management and operation, problems in personnel, and problems in ideological understanding. These problems must be solved so that good plans, good systems and measures can be thoroughly implemented. This is particularly important for backward townships and cooperatives, and general townships and cooperatives should continue to pay attention to it.
    In order to effectively achieve the production increase plan targets, the leading comrades of many provinces (cities) and special districts have already gone down to conduct inspections, help the comrades below overcome specific difficulties, take specific measures, promptly discover and promote good practices, and promptly discover and correct shortcomings in the work. It should be said that this year's leadership and inspection of production and construction are more in-depth and specific than in any previous year. Below the county (city) level, it is rare to see the situation of simply sitting in the office and giving orders. This is the positive result of the great rectification movement. This major change in ideological style will have a positive impact on socialist agricultural construction and the entire rural work. We hope that all leading cadres and rural staff can step out of the office, go deep down, be with the masses, and strive by every possible means to achieve advanced production increase plan targets.

### 千方百计实现增产指标

    千方百计实现增产指标
    一个广大群众性的发展农业生产和建设社会主义新农村的高潮，正在全国范围内沸腾着。这个高潮带来了全国农村今年春耕生产的全面高涨的新形势。现在有更多的县、市，决心要提前实现农业发展纲要草案中提出的粮食增产的“四、五、八”指标和其他指标。一般地区，也都深入地研究和挖掘了增产的潜力，打破保守思想，订出了较高的跃进计划。
    大幅度的增产，今年有更多的有利条件。全国的水田和水浇地面积过去只有三亿九千多万亩，今年新增加了二亿几千万亩。大量的新修水利工程，保证了大量的农田能够免受旱灾和涝灾，取得丰收。还有大量低洼地和盐碱地的改造，土壤的改良，深翻地和山区水土保持工程的增加，肥料的增加，高产作物和复种面积的增加等等，所有这些对于今年农业的增产都非常有利。
    正像革命战争时期有许多人不相信国内外强大的敌人能够被打倒一样，1956年以来一直有许多人不大相信农业增产指标能够迅速提高。但是铁一般的事实教育了人们，使人们相信，改变了的生产关系，能够使生产力的发展加快好多倍。过去必须十几年、几十年、几百年才能做到的事情，现在能够在几年内甚至一、二年内做到。合作化的生产，使生产者的智慧和创造力得到充分的发挥，产量可以迅速地达到人们难以想像的高峰。解放以前亩产量平均不过五百斤的广东澄海、潮安二县，1956年亩产量平均达到了一千斤，被称为千斤县。这在当时是被认为奇迹的。许多人不能深刻理解亩产量飞速提高的社会根源，曾经断言这两县生产已经达到顶点，不相信能够继续提高；甚至不相信能够保持千斤的纪录。然而，事实却不理睬人们的主观武断而沿着自己的方向继续前进了。1957年这两个县的平均亩产量都跃进到了一千二百斤以上。原因是农民群众在党的领导下更进一步兴修水利，改造低产田，推广先进耕作技术。山西平顺县的贫瘠山区，石厚土薄，解放以前耕地的平均亩产量不过七八十斤。但就是这样不利的自然条件，也没有挡住合作化制度所解放了的生产力的发展。在李顺达、郭玉恩、武侯梨领导的农业合作社，农业发展纲要所提的指标也已经提前实现并且超过，1957年亩产量平均都在四百斤以上。全国统计，在1956年提前达到农业发展纲要所提亩产量指标的，有三十二个县市。到1957年又有三十二个县市提前达到，一共是六十四个县市。
    目前广大人民群众思想的解放和革命干劲的增长都大大超过了过去两年，尤其是去年冬季以来兴修水利的运动，使人民群众从大量的事实中看到了自己的力量，看到了自然条件是可以用人的主观努力来改变的。这种辩证唯物主义的觉醒，使他们不再屈服于命运的安排，不再听天由命，而变得敢于对任何巨大的困难宣战。这种激越奋发的革命精神，将冲决前进道路上的一切艰难险阻。
    深刻地认识和充分地利用这许多新的有利条件，我们就一定能够争得今年农业战线上大幅度的增产。当前特别重要的，是继续发动广大群众，想出各种各样具体的办法来实现已经制定的增产计划和先进指标。综合各地最近期间的活动，以下几个方面具有重要的意义。
    第一、迅速而普遍地传播和学习先进地区的增产经验、新技术和新作法，使广大农民放宽眼界，思想上不断得到新的启发，能够想出各种新的措施。在这一方面，各地已经做了许多，但还没有十分普遍地做。有一些落后的和偏僻的乡村，很少知道别处的事情。即使听到一些，也很不具体。这些乡村一直很少有切实的增产措施。这种情形亟须引起各地领导机关的注意，迅速地加以积极的帮助。
    第二、大部县分现在已经订出不少全县性的增产措施，这是很好的。但有的忽视了各乡各社因地制宜的具体措施，没有把大范围内统一的增产措施和各乡各社特殊的增产措施结合起来。以致有一些乡和社，因为要执行全县的总任务而或多或少地延误了本乡本社的特殊措施。这种情形必须引起注意。各县（市）领导干部和一般工作人员应当深入到各乡各社的群众中去，一方面介绍外地的增产经验，一方面同群众共同讨论适合本乡本社的增产措施，尤其是要同有经验的老农共同商讨。只要能把群众的积极性发动起来，这种适合于本地的措施就一定能够找到。
    第三、县的领导干部和工作人员应当深入到各乡各社的群众中去了解情况，发现增产计划执行中的实际问题和障碍，团结积极分子和广大群众，共同来解决这些实际问题，克服这些障碍。这里有经营管理上的问题，有人事上的问题，也有思想认识上的问题。必须解决了这些问题，好的计划、好的制度和措施才能贯彻执行到底。这一点对于落后的乡、社特别重要，而一般的乡、社也要继续注意。
    为了有效地实现增产计划指标，许多省（市）和专区的领导同志都已经深入到下面去进行检查，帮助下面同志克服具体困难，采取具体措施，及时地发现和推广好的做法，及时地发现和纠正工作中的缺点。应当说，对生产和建设的领导和检查，今年是比过去任何一年都更加深入而具体的。县（市）级以下，也很少再看到单纯坐在办公室发号施令的情形了。这是伟大的整风运动的积极成果。这种思想作风上的重大变化，将在社会主义的农业建设和整个农村工作上发生积极的影响。我们希望所有的领导干部和农村工作人员都能够走出办公室，深入下去，同群众在一起，千万百计地争取先进的增产计划指标的实现。
