    A Debate Brings About...
    One evening in early March, just as the Hongyang Cooperative was holding a debate on "Five Arrivals to the Hills," an old farmer in his seventies, Li Panming, stood up and said, "The cooperative has accumulated a lot of fertilizer, but the cooperative and team cadres lack planning. Layering grass on the deep, muddy rice paddies in the mountains and accumulating manure in front of every household is only for the convenience of transporting fertilizer, regardless of the actual needs." Young cooperative member Li Shulin followed up, saying, "As long as we desperately apply fertilizer, we don't have to worry about the crops not growing." Old man Li didn't see it that way, and he gave an example: One mu and three fen of land in the cold-soaked fields of Team Six's Tuanqiu plot was fertilized with 700 dan of grass last year, and the result was that the base became deeper, the soil didn't warm up, the roots didn't grow, and the harvest was only 400 jin of grain; eight fen of land in the cold-soaked fields of Shuqiu plot were fertilized with only 150 dan of grass, plus more than 60 dan of chicken coop mud, cow dung, and pig manure, and the harvest was 450 jin of grain last year. The unit area yield of Shuqiu was more than 80% higher than that of Tuanqiu, precisely because it achieved reasonable fertilization. After discussing the importance of reasonable fertilization, the cooperative members cited the fact that many fertilizers are currently applied unreasonably. For example, on the more than 500 mu of sandy land on the sandbar of Teams Three and Four, each mu has more than 20 dan of pig manure, while the 300 mu of hard, crusted land of Teams Five and Six has no pig manure at all. The fields of Teams Nineteen, Twenty, and Twenty-one are all deep, muddy fields, and although the current fertilizer application is more than 500 dan per mu, soil fertilizer accounts for 80% of it, and cow manure is only 3 dan per mu. ... This small debate in the Hongyang Cooperative raised the issue of reasonable fertilization. So, how did this cooperative implement reasonable fertilization based on the opinions of the masses? The above news is about this matter.

    一场辩论带来的……
    在3月上旬的一个晚上，正当虹阳社开展关于“五到丘”的辩论时，七十多岁的老农李盘明站起来说：“社内肥料积得不少，就是社队干部少了个盘算，山垅深脚烂泥田里草皮铺一层，门前户首畜粪起了堆，只图运肥方便，不管需要。”青年社员李树林接着说：“只要拼命放肥料，不怕不长禾”。李老头不是这样看，他便举出了一个例子：六队团丘一亩三分田，是冷浸田，去年放了七百担草皮，结果底子更深，泥不热，根不长，只收谷四百斤；树丘八分田，也是冷浸田，只放一百五十担草皮，另外放了六十多担鸡埘泥、牛粪和猪粪，去年收谷四百五十斤。树丘的单位面积产量比团丘高80％多，就是因为做到了合理施肥。社员们讨论了合理施肥的重要意义后，举出了目前许多肥料施放不合理的事实，如三、四队大沙洲上的五百多亩沙田，猪粪每亩有了二十多担，而五、六队三百多亩牛皮结板田，猪粪一点也没有，十九、二十、二十一等三个队的田都是深脚烂泥田，目前每亩肥料虽达五百多担，但其中土肥却占80％，牛粪每亩只有三担。……虹阳社这场小辩论，提出了合理施肥问题。那么，这个社怎样根据群众意见，实行合理施肥呢？上面这个消息就是谈的这事。
