Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 31st: The Daming Electric Motor Factory in Tianjin has widely launched technical innovation activities, with everyone from top to bottom involved in grasping technology, providing a solid guarantee for the realization of this year's leap forward plan.

The Daming Electric Motor Factory is a factory that produces electric motors, and this year's production tasks are more than four times higher than last year. The factory leadership realized from the beginning that technical work must keep up to ensure the realization of the leap forward plan. They organized engineers, technicians, and veteran workers to study and identify ten major technical measures, and assigned specific personnel to be responsible for their implementation. These measures not only increased output and improved quality but also reduced costs. For example, by learning from the experience of the Boshan Electric Motor Factory, they replaced copper sheets with cast aluminum in the motor rotors, reducing nine processes to three, increasing production efficiency by 3.75 times, improving the performance of the motor, and saving 90.7 tons of copper. This one measure reduced the cost of each kilowatt of motor by 6.5 yuan, and this year it can save more than 740,000 yuan, which is more than 45% of the factory's total capital. Another example is that the factory adopted advanced operation methods such as "three-circle blanking," changing the silicon steel sheet blanking from three processes to one, increasing production efficiency by more than two times, and saving more than 70,000 man-hours without grinding or filing. It can also improve insulation strength, improve motor quality, and reduce the processing margin of silicon steel sheets, saving a considerable amount of silicon steel sheets.

Currently, the focus of technical innovation in this factory is shifting from improving operations and tools to breaking through technical conventions and improving product design. Technical innovation has promoted the leap forward in production throughout the factory. Now, workers have generally increased quotas by 40%, with the highest increases reaching 300%. The production in March alone was more than the total of January and February. The factory's production is rising sharply.

    开展技术革新　保证生产跃进
    天津大明电机厂三月份产量猛增一倍
    据新华社天津31日电　天津市大明电机厂广泛开展技术革新活动，上下一齐动手抓技术，使实现今年的跃进计划有了稳固的保证。
    大明电机厂是一个生产电动机的工厂，今年的生产任务比去年增长四倍多。这个厂领导方面一开始就意识到必须把技术工作跟上去，来保证跃进计划的实现。他们组织工程技术人员和老工人研究，找出十项重大的技术措施，并由专人负责，抓紧实现。这些措施不仅提高了产量，改进了质量，还降低了成本。如他们学习博山电机厂的经验，把电动机中的转子用铸铝代替铜片，九道工序减为三道，生产效率提高了三点七五倍，提高了电动机的性能，并且省铜九十点七吨。这一项措施，使每瓩电动机成本降低六点五元，今年可以节约七十四万多元，比这个厂的全部资金还多45％以上。又如，这个厂采用“三圈
  下料”等先进操作方法，把矽钢片
  下料由三道工序改为一道，提高生产效率两倍多，而且不磨不锉，节省工时七万多个，还可以提高绝缘强度，提高电动机的质量，减少矽钢片的加工余量，节约不少的矽钢片。
    目前，这个厂技术革新的矛头正由改进操作、改进工具，开始向突破技术陈规、改进产品设计方面发展。技术革新推动了全厂生产跃进。现在工人们普遍提高定额40％，最高的提高300％。3月份一个月的生产，比1、2月份的总和还多。全厂生产正在急剧上升中。
