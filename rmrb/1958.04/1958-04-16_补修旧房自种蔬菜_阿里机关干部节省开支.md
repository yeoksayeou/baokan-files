    Repairing Old Houses and Growing Vegetables
    The Organs of the Ali Save Expenses
    All comrades of the organs of the Ali Sub-Committee of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, in the stage of rectification and study, implemented the spirit of rectification and correction at the same time, and saved the two budget construction costs of 590,000 yuan for the construction of 1,873 square meters of organ housing and 1,540 cubic meters of walls, which were originally planned to be built this year, to support the national industrial and agricultural production and construction, and make full use of the original old adobe houses. Everyone also unanimously stated: As long as we work together and repair the old houses, there will be no problem living in them for another three or four years.
    In terms of vegetable production, in the past, most of the vegetable supply relied on dried vegetables transported from Xinjiang, with annual freight costs of more than 20,000 yuan. Everyone is determined to muster the revolutionary spirit of socialism and strive to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables throughout the year. The above two items can save the country 610,000 yuan.

    补修旧房自种蔬菜
    阿里机关干部节省开支
    中共西藏工委阿里分工委各机关全体同志，在整风学习的鸣放阶段中，贯彻了边整边改的精神，将今年预定打算修建的机关住房一千八百七十三平方公尺、围墙一千五百四十立方公尺的两项预算修建费共五十九万元，节省下来支援全国工农业生产建设，充分利用原有的旧土房。大家还一致表示：只要齐心努力，动手修补旧房，再住三、四年是没有问题的。
    在蔬菜生产方面，过去大部分蔬菜供应是依靠新疆运来的干菜，每年运费约在两万元以上。大家下决心鼓起社会主义的革命干劲，争取做到全年蔬菜自给。以上两项可为国家节约六十一万元。
