    Thoughts Inspired by the "Dumpling Processing Station"
    Jiang Zhishui
    The People's Daily reported on April 2nd that the Tianjin Catering Company recently established a processing service station for making dumplings for customers. This station has various dumpling fillings available. Customers only need to send flour, and they can pick up ready-made dumplings.
    The establishment of the dumpling processing station makes me feel the loveliness of our society, makes me think of a brand new scene between people, and also makes me think of the original spirit of establishing a dumpling processing station. May I ask, who would have dared to have such an extravagant thought before, sending flour before going to work and being able to eat dumplings immediately after work? Which housewife would have ever thought that she no longer needs to run around the market and go through a busy time after coming back, and she can serve fragrant and delicious dumplings to her family? However, all of this has become a reality today. What could not be done in the past can be done today; what you had to do yourself in the past is now done for you by others. The establishment of the dumpling processing station has brought so much convenience to people, and it has freed so many housewives from some of the busy housework. Isn't this an original action full of revolutionary spirit!
    The "Dumpling Processing Station" has also broadened people's minds, making people think: With the first processing service station, won't there be a second and a third...? With the dumpling processing service station, won't some other processing service stations appear?
    However, the more important enlightenment for people is to understand the ordinary truth of "Everyone for me, me for everyone." When you eat fragrant and delicious dumplings, wouldn't you think that you live in this society, others have done so many things for you, what contribution should you give to others, to this society?

### 由“饺子加工站”想起的

    由“饺子加工站”想起的
    江之水
    4月2日人民日报报道，最近天津饮食公司设立了一个给顾客包饺子的加工服务站。这个站备有各种饺子馅，顾客只要把面粉送去，就可以取回包好的饺子。
    饺子加工站的设立，让我感到了我们这个社会的可爱，想到了人与人之间的一种崭新的情景，也让我想到了设立饺子加工站的这种独创的精神。请问，在这以前谁敢有过这样的奢想，上班前送去了面粉，下班后马上可以吃到饺子？哪位家庭主妇又曾想到过，从此不必再到街市上东跑西跑和经过回来以后的一番忙碌，就可以给一家人端上来喷香可口的饺子？但是，这一切今天都已成为事实，过去做不到的，今天做到了；过去你必须自己做的，现在有别人为你做了。饺子加工站的设立不知给人们带来多少方便，不知可以使多少家庭主妇可以从繁忙的家务劳动中解脱一部分，难道这不是一种富有革命精神的独创行动！
    “饺子加工站”也开阔了人的脑筋，让人想到：有了第一个加工服务站，难道不会再有第二个第三个………？有了饺子的加工服务站，难道不会再出现一些别的加工服务站了吗？
    然而，给人更重要的启示是让人懂得了“人人为我，我为人人”的这个平凡的道理，当你吃到喷香可口的饺子的时候，难道你不会想到，你生活在这个社会里，别人为你做了这么多事情，你该给别人，给这个社会一些什么贡献呢？
