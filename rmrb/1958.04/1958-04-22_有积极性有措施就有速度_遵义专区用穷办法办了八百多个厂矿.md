With Enthusiasm and Measures, There is Speed
Zunyi Prefecture Uses Poor Methods to Establish Over 800 Factories and Mines

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Zunyi, April 21st) Zunyi Prefecture is developing local industry using poor methods. From New Year's Day to the end of March, 845 factories and mines have been built, with an average of more than nine factories and mines going into production every day.

Zunyi Prefecture is rich in resources. Underground, there are more than 20 kinds of minerals with considerable reserves, such as iron, coal, manganese, phosphorus, sulfur, oil shale, copper, lead, and zinc. Above ground, it abounds in grains, miscellaneous cereals, pigs, silk, oil crops, tobacco, and hemp. The output of silkworm cocoons, paper mulberry bark, and Quercus wutaishanica exceeds the total output of other prefectures in the province. However, for a long time, due to a shortage of funds, weak technology, and insufficient equipment, the industrial base was quite poor. This year, Zunyi region used various poor ideas and indigenous methods proposed by the masses to solve the difficulties of funds, technology, and equipment. They mobilized old factories to contribute a portion of their accumulated funds and encouraged commercial, handicraft, agricultural cooperatives, and other non-industrial sectors to invest. Factories established by the people adopted the method of simultaneous production and construction, using profits to expand reproduction. For example, the Wuchuan County Lime Factory invested 36 yuan and was built in three days. After 18 days of production, it turned over 80 yuan in profits. For some larger factories and mines, several counties jointly invested in them. For some products that were abundant in local resources and needed by other provinces, other provinces were organized to invest. With the above measures, the entire region raised 6.46 million yuan in a short period, and it is expected to reach 10 million yuan by the end of the year, which basically meets the needs of building factories this year.

They mobilized everyone to contribute ideas and suggestions, and searched for and cultivated technical personnel from all aspects. The Xiazi District of Zunyi County found more than 140 local technicians in one go. Tongzi County discovered turners, fitters, and smelters in agricultural cooperatives and small towns. Among the cadres of the region's organizations, it was found that more than 100 people understood technology, and more than 50 rural cadres understood technology as well. Now these technical personnel have all returned to their posts. The counties also organized more than 100 cadres and workers to go to Chongqing, Beijing, Hubei and other places to learn about baking rubber, canning, copper smelting, and manufacturing chemical fertilizers. They also transferred some technical cadres from old factories to support new factories, or the old factories helped the new factories train technical personnel. Many counties also held elementary technical training classes in industry, sericulture, and flue-cured tobacco. Some factories ran part-time work-study night schools to cultivate new forces.

For the equipment needed to build factories, they strived to obtain materials locally and manufacture them locally. For example, machines for manual oil pressing, screens and water pumps for papermaking, and converters for chemical plants were all manufactured locally. Only when local solutions were impossible were purchases or exchanges made from other places. For example, steel and canning factory equipment were exchanged from Sichuan with pig iron, lacquer wax, and live pigs. A portion of machinery and equipment was also discovered during inventory clearance.

    有积极性有措施就有速度
    遵义专区用穷办法办了八百多个厂矿
    本报遵义21日电　遵义专区用穷办法发展地方工业，从元旦到3月底止，已建成八百四十五个厂矿，平均每天有九个以上厂矿投入生产。
    遵义专区资源丰富。地下有铁、煤、锰、磷、硫磺、油页岩、铜、铅、锌等二十多种蕴藏量相当大的矿藏。地上盛产五谷杂粮、猪、蚕、油料、烟、麻等；蚕茧、构皮麻、青杠子的产量超过全省其他专区产量的总和。但长期以来，由于资金短绌，技术薄弱，设备不足，工业底子相当差。今年，遵义地区运用群众提出的各种穷主意、土办法，解决了资金、技术、设备等困难。他们动员老厂拿出一部分积累，鼓励商业、手工业、农业社等非工业部门投资。民建厂中采取边生产边建设的办法，用利润来扩大再生产。如婺川县石灰厂，投资三十六元，三天建成，生产十八天，上缴利润即达八十元。对一些较大的厂矿，则组织几个县联合投资举办；对一些本地资源丰富而又为外省需要的产品，则组织外省投资。采取以上措施，全区在短期内筹集了六百四十六万元资金，年底预计可达一千万元，基本上满足了今年建设工厂的需要。
    他们发动全民献计献策，从各方面寻找和培养技术人员。遵义县虾子区一次就找到土技师一百四十多人。桐梓县在农业社和小城镇发现了车工、钳工和冶炼工人。在全区机关干部中，查出有一百多人懂得技术，在农村干部中懂得技术的也有五十多人，现在这批技术人员都已归队。各县还组织了一百多名干部和工人到重庆、北京、湖北等地，学习烤胶、罐头加工、炼铜、制造化学肥料等。他们又从老厂调出一部分技术干部支援新厂，或由老厂帮助新厂培养技术人员。许多县还举办了初级的工业、蚕丝、烤烟等技术训练班，有的厂搞半工半读的夜校，培养新生力量。
    建厂需要的设备，他们力争能就地取材，就地制造。如手工榨油用的机器，造纸用的帘子、水泵，化工厂的转锅等，都是本地制造的。本地无法解决时，才从外地采购或调换。如用生铁、漆腊、生猪等，从四川换回钢材、罐头厂设备。在清理库存中也发掘了一部分机器和器材。
