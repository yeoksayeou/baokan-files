    Writer Zhou Libo in the Countryside
    The writer Zhou Libo has lived in the Taohualun Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Yiyang City, Hunan Province for more than a year. Now he is the Deputy Secretary of the Taohualun Township Party Committee. He often wears a blue cloth apron and works with the peasants. At first, he carried thirty or forty catties and felt his legs weak and shoulders aching, but now he carries eighty catties and walks quickly. For more than a year, he has eaten, lived, and worked with the peasants, and has made some close friends. He has already recorded more than 200,000 words of material, and only used a portion of it to write "Great Changes in a Mountain Village."
    Zhou Libo plans to draw material from the countryside this year to write three short stories, seven essays, and miscellaneous essays. He has already published two essays. He feels that actual life is exceptionally rich and inexhaustible, but he wants to participate in more labor this year to strengthen himself and go deeper into the masses, and does not want to rush to write things for the time being.

    作家周立波在农村
    作家周立波在湖南益阳市郊桃花仑农业社住了一年多。现在他是桃花仑乡的党委副书记。他常常围着一条蓝布腰围巾和农民一道生产，开始他挑三、四十斤，感到腿软肩痛，现在挑八十斤，快步如飞。一年多以来，他和农民同吃、同住、同劳动，并且交了一些知心朋友。他已经记了二十多万字的素材，写“山乡巨变”只用了其中一部分材料。
    周立波计划今年从农村取材，写三个短篇小说、七篇散文和杂文，现在已发表两篇散文。他觉得实际生活异常丰富，怎么也写不完，但是他想今年多参加劳动，锻炼自己，更深入到群众中去，暂时不想忙着写东西。
