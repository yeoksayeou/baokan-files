    Jinping Promotes "Forest-Grain Intercropping"
    Jinping County, Guizhou Province, is comprehensively promoting the "forest-grain intercropping" experience of the Sanjiang Township Forestry Production Cooperative this year.
    The county plans to intercrop grain crops in 80,000 mu of young forest land. Currently, more than 30,000 forestry farmers are fighting day and night, and many people have moved to the mountains to live.
    The practice of "forest-grain intercropping" is as follows: first, the suitable forest wasteland is generally dug over once, and then fir seedlings are planted during the afforestation season. Around the second month of the lunar calendar, sweet potatoes, millet, corn and other grain crops are intercropped in the fir seedling land. Weeding is done two to three times each year to remove weeds and apply sufficient fertilizer. In this way, weeding grain crops also cultivates the seedlings, which helps the fir seedlings grow. After intercropping grain crops for three to four consecutive years, intercropping is stopped. In the future, the young forest will be cultivated once every three to five years, and the fir trees can be felled after eighteen years.

### 锦屏推广“林粮混作”

    锦屏推广“林粮混作”
    贵州锦屏县今年全面推广三江镇林业生产合作社的“林粮混作”经验。
    全县计划在八万亩幼林地里间作粮食作物，眼前三万多林农正日夜战斗，许多人还搬到山上住。
    “林粮混作”的做法是：先把宜林荒地普遍挖过一次，到了造林季节就栽上杉苗；古历二月左右在杉苗地里间种红薯、小米和玉米等粮食作物。每年薅二至三次，除掉杂草，同时施足肥料。这样，在薅粮食作物的同时也抚育了幼苗，有助杉苗成长。连续间作三至四年粮食作物后，就不再间作了。往后每间隔三、五年再抚育幼林一次，十八年后杉木就可砍伐。
