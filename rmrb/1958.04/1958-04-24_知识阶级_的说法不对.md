    The Term "Knowledge Class" Is Incorrect
    In your newspaper's March 28th, second page, in the "Post-Editing" column under the title "Look at Them with New Eyes," there is the following passage: "'A scholar who has been away for three days should be looked at with new eyes.' The 'scholar' mentioned here refers to a person who studies, a knowledge class." Intellectuals are a stratum, not a class, which is common knowledge. The editor probably knows this, and it may have been a slip of the pen. I hope it will be corrected.

    “知识阶级”的说法不对
    你报3月28日第二版“编后”栏“刮目相看”标题下有这样一段话：“‘士别三日当刮目相看，’这里说的‘士’，是读书人，是知识阶级。”知识分子是一个阶层，不是一个阶级，这是一般常识。编报人不会不清楚，可能是笔下之误，希更正。
