Bi-Monthly International Review
(March 19 - April 3)

    The first quarter of 1958 has passed. The development of the international situation has brought people new hopes and confidence. The socialist camp countries, led by the Soviet Union, are going all out for the construction of communism and socialism, making a great leap forward. Socialist countries have taken one initiative after another with confidence in order to strive for easing international tensions and practicing peaceful coexistence. The Soviet Union has worked hard to promote the early convening of a summit conference, successively implemented unilateral disarmament, and announced a unilateral cessation of atomic and nuclear weapons testing; the Chinese People's Volunteers, in response to the suggestions of the Korean and Chinese governments, have begun to withdraw from the Korean battlefield back to the motherland; the socialist countries unanimously support the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Central Europe and Asia, and advocate that the people of Korea, Vietnam, and Germany solve the issue of peaceful reunification themselves. All these peace-promoting initiatives and actions have been praised and supported worldwide. In contrast, the shadow of economic crisis has enveloped the capitalist world led by the United States. According to a report released by the United Nations Economic Commission on April 2, the industrial situation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1957 was better than expected in every location, and the standard of living had increased considerably. The economic situation in many Western countries is deteriorating, and the prospects are bleak. The monopoly capitalist groups in Western countries are very afraid of peace, clinging to the policy of arms expansion and war preparation, and trying their best to maintain international tension. This is contrary to the wishes of the broad masses of people. In the Asian and African regions, the anti-colonialist struggle and the struggle against foreign interference have also made further progress. The widespread movement of the "Day of Solidarity with Algeria" of the Asian and African People on March 30 was of great momentum, demonstrating the common will of the Asian and African people.
    People of All Countries Unanimously Demand a Halt to Nuclear Weapons Testing
    The Soviet Union's decision to stop explosive testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons has already attracted worldwide attention.
    Recently, on the issues of convening a summit conference and disarmament, the United States and its partners, on the one hand, emphasized the need to discuss substantive issues at the foreign ministers' conference, and to include issues of interference in the internal affairs of Eastern European countries and German reunification on the agenda, delaying matters; on the other hand, they have been stepping up atomic preparations, deciding to arm West German troops with atomic and rocket weapons, increasing tensions in Europe. At this time, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided to stop testing atomic weapons and nuclear weapons in the Soviet Union, and called on other countries possessing atomic weapons to take the same measures to ensure a permanent and universal cessation of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons testing. This bold action declared to the world that as long as the major powers are sincere, it is entirely possible to stop nuclear weapons testing. This would further promote mutual trust between countries, prohibit the use and production of nuclear weapons, and free mankind from concerns about the fate of peace and the fate of human descendants. The question now is what the United States and Britain, which possess atomic weapons, will do.
    The ruling groups in the United States and Britain have rejected the Soviet call. In recent days, Eisenhower, Dulles, and even officials from the U.S. State Department have expressed their unwillingness to stop nuclear weapons testing. Macmillan also defended Britain's continued nuclear weapons testing. They even absurdly claimed that nuclear weapons tests could be conducted secretly without being detected by foreign countries, attempting to dilute the political impact of the Soviet action. This shows that stopping nuclear weapons testing still depends on the unyielding struggle of all peace-loving people.
    In Britain, since the United States and Britain signed the agreement to establish missile bases, the British people have widely launched a struggle against the establishment of missile bases. Included in this movement are the broad masses of working people, intellectuals, and even some sober-minded people within the ruling class. Many British trade union organizations and 204 professors from the University of London have successively demanded that the government stop nuclear weapons testing, prevent American aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs from flying over Britain, and oppose the establishment of missile bases. On April 4, the British people held a large-scale peace demonstration. The people of France and Italy also fiercely opposed the government's plan to establish missile bases. In Germany, because the West German Federal Parliament passed a resolution to equip the army with atomic weapons, and the West German government has also announced the purchase of the first batch of missiles from the United States, the German people have launched a wave of protest against this perverse act of the West German government. The government of the German Democratic Republic and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, Ulbricht, issued statements condemning the West German government's decision as an attack on the safety and peace of the German people and the people of all other countries, and a torpedo aimed at the summit conference and the peaceful reunification of Germany. The National Front of the German Democratic Republic called on the entire German people to unite and oppose atomic armament. The First Secretary of the German Communist Party, Reimann, called on the West German people to launch a nationwide resistance movement. People from all walks of life in West Germany held a rally in Frankfurt to protest the Adenauer government's policy of implementing atomic armament in West Germany, and called for "fighting atomic death." West German trade unions called for a general strike, and the West German Social Democratic Party demanded the resignation of the Adenauer government. The German people, who have suffered deeply from the disasters of war, are resolutely opposed to Adenauer's warmongering policies.
    The Soviet Union's decision to stop hydrogen bomb testing has greatly encouraged the courage and determination of people around the world to demand a halt to nuclear weapons testing. In April, the movement to demand a halt to nuclear weapons testing will have a broader development.
    The United States Cannot Extricate Itself from the Abyss of Economic Recession
    On March 26, U.S. President Eisenhower, in order to stabilize public sentiment, said once again: "The lowest point of the U.S. economic decline is approaching, and may have already arrived," but the actual situation is getting worse and worse.
    U.S. industrial production continued to decline in March. The operating rate of the steel industry averaged only about 50%, and several large steel mills were forced to reduce production and shut down. The Ford Motor Company's Rouge River steel plant and the National Steel Corporation's Detroit area plant had to shut down for three weeks. The production of the automobile industry and the petroleum industry was reduced the most in this month, with automobile production decreasing by 9% and petroleum decreasing by 8% compared with February.
    The number of unemployed workers continued to increase, estimated to have increased by another 200,000 to 300,000 in March. However, prices are still rising, and the U.S. cost of living index rose to a new high of 122.5 in February (the average for 1947-1949 was 100), and workers' real wages were down 5% from a year ago.
    The well-known American economist Perroux believes that the stage of the crisis of overproduction has come to the United States, and may become the beginning of a large-scale economic crisis in the world capitalism. "The New York Times" also had to admit that "economic crisis is a chronic disease of the capitalist system" and "an unavoidable reality of life."
    Faced with a severe economic recession, the U.S. government is trying its best to take various measures to prevent the recession from continuing. In the past half month, it has proposed the "No. 1 Anti-Recession Plan," allocating more than 1.85 billion U.S. dollars to build housing; the "No. 2 Anti-Recession Plan," allocating 5.5 billion U.S. dollars to build highways. Eisenhower proposed to use 500-600 million U.S. dollars of government funds to extend the period for unemployed workers to receive relief, and on April 2, he requested Congress to increase military appropriations by 1.455 billion U.S. dollars. The managers of several of the largest U.S. automobile companies agreed to launch a "sales campaign" to promote the sale of automobiles. There are also very high voices from all sides calling for tax cuts. The CIO-AFL has twice proposed to reduce taxes by 6 billion to 8 billion U.S. dollars. Due to the inconsistency of interests of the U.S. monopoly groups, the methods to deal with the economic recession also vary. The mutual attacks and disputes within the U.S. government and between the Republican and Democratic parties are also becoming increasingly fierce.
    The economic recession has spread to the entire capitalist world. In many Western countries, inflation, rising prices, and reduced real wages have made workers' lives increasingly difficult. In the past half month, the struggle for wage increases has intensified. Following the strikes in many industrial cities such as Rouillon, Saint-Étienne, and Brest in France, a large-scale strike of one million workers broke out on April 1, with railways, gas, and electricity all cut off. These workers in state-owned industries demanded a 20% wage increase. In West Germany and West Berlin, a large-scale strike of 350,000 public service workers also occurred on March 19, cutting off public transportation in more than 150 large and small cities, and completely stopping the supply of water, electricity, and gas. The spring struggle of Japanese workers demanding improved treatment has also reached a climax. On March 27, a large-scale fourth joint action began, with workers in railways, coal mines, ports, synthetic chemicals, and other sectors all involved in the struggle. The indefinite key strikes that began on the 21st in fifteen mines of four major companies such as "Mitsui" and "Mitsubishi" are still continuing.
    Large-Scale Anti-Colonialist Demonstrations and Struggles Against Interference in Internal Affairs
    In the past half month, the anti-colonialist struggle in Asia and Africa has had new developments in two aspects.
    On March 30, the "Day of Solidarity with Algeria" formed a vigorous anti-colonialist, supporting Algerian people's grand demonstration in Asian and African countries. The United Arab Republic, Tunisia, Libya, the Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, Korea, Mongolia, India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and Ceylon held various gatherings, and some countries also conducted fundraising. The Asian and African people unanimously expressed warm support for the Algerian people's heroic anti-colonialist struggle, strongly condemned France's colonial policy, demanded recognition of Algeria's independence, and resolved the Algerian issue through negotiations. Undoubtedly, this will give great encouragement to the Algerian people and all Asian and African people who are fighting for anti-colonialism. Just as Abbas, a leader of the Algerian National Liberation Front, said in Cairo: "We are no longer alone, we are no longer living in 1830 (the year France occupied Algeria)." "The Algerian people are fighting for independence, and they will surely win. Because they are full of confidence in their victory."
    In Indonesia, a widespread movement against U.S. interference in internal affairs is unfolding.
    Since the Indonesian government forces landed in Central Sumatra, they have won successive victories. Now the government forces have completely eliminated the rebels in East Sumatra, entered West Sumatra, and are preparing to destroy the last nest of the rebels - Padang and Bukittinggi. The rebels have already shown signs of collapse. When the government forces recovered Kiliranjao, a battalion of rebels surrendered.
    The government forces seized a large number of weapons in battle, including mortars, rocket launchers, and various automatic rifles, all made in the United States. These weapons were airdropped by DC4 American transport planes, and some were smuggled in from the Philippines and Singapore. Recently revealed materials further confirmed that the United States is using Taiwan, the territory of our country that it has occupied, as a base of operations to interfere in Indonesia. The United States instructed the Chiang Kai-shek group to supply weapons to the Indonesian rebels. Recently, the Lee Syngman group in South Korea has also openly clamored for supporting the Indonesian rebels and clamoring to send an "expeditionary force." It seems that the United States itself does not dare to openly support the Indonesian rebels, but has adopted a more insidious plan, instructing the Chiang Kai-shek and Lee Syngman groups to directly interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs.
    The interference of the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has aroused great anger among the Indonesian people. Since late March, the Indonesian people have launched a mass movement against the interference in internal affairs by the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The All-Indonesia Central Trade Union called on workers in factories, plantations, mines, and docks to condemn the interference of the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization in the internal affairs of other countries, and demanded the closure of the institutions of the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan in Indonesia. On March 23, the words "The People Oppose the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Interfering in Indonesia" appeared on the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia. Subsequently, mass organizations such as Jakarta's university students and peasant front demonstrated in front of the U.S. Embassy and delivered protest letters. Students in Surabaya demonstrated in front of the U.S. Consulate. The United Solidarity Cooperation Association of Fighters for the Unification of the Republic of Indonesia in Central Sumatra and the chairman of the Minangkabau (the ethnic group in the Padang area occupied by the rebels) Association unanimously condemned foreign interference and accused the United States of inciting the rebellion.
    The awakened Indonesian people will absolutely not tolerate the interference of the United States and its lackeys, the Chiang Kai-shek and Lee Syngman groups. The people of China and Asia will continue to fully support the Indonesian government and people in their struggle against foreign interference.

    半月国际述评
    （三月十九日—四月三日）
    1958年第一季度过去了。国际形势的发展，给人们带来了新的希望和信心。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国正在为共产主义和社会主义的建设，鼓足干劲，大跃进。社会主义各国为了争取缓和国际紧张局势，实行和平共处，充满信心地采取了一个接一个的主动措施。苏联努力促进早日召开最高级会议，先后实行了单方面的裁军，宣布了单方面停止试验原子武器和核武器；中国人民志愿军为了响应朝中两国政府的建议，已经开始从朝鲜战场撤回祖国；社会主义各国一致支持建立中欧和亚洲无原子武器区，主张由朝鲜、越南和德国人民自己解决和平统一的问题。这一切促进和平的创议和行动，得到举世的赞扬和支持。与此相反，经济危机的阴影已经笼罩了以美国为首的资本主义世界。据联合国经济委员会在4月2日发表的报告说：1957年苏联和东欧，任何一个地方的工业情况都比预期要好，生活水平有了相当大的提高。而许多西方国家的经济情况在恶化，而且前景很黯淡。西方国家的垄断资本集团十分害怕和平，死死抓住扩军备战政策，竭力保持国际间的紧张局势。这是同广大人民的愿望相违背的。而亚非地区，反殖民主义斗争和反对外国干涉的斗争，也有了进一步的开展。3月30日，亚非人民“声援阿尔及利亚日”的广泛运动，声势浩大，表现了亚非人民共同的意志。
    各国人民一致要求停止试验核武器
    苏联决定停止原子武器和氢武器的爆炸性试验，已经吸引住了全世界的注意力。
    最近期间，在召开最高级会议和裁军问题上，由于美国和它的伙伴，一面强调要在外长会议上讨论实质问题，并且要把干涉东欧各国内政和德国统一的问题列入议程，拖延时日；一面却在加紧原子备战，决定用原子和火箭武器来武装西德军队，增加了欧洲的紧张气氛。在这个时候，苏联最高苏维埃决定在苏联停止试验原子武器和核武器，并且呼吁其他拥有原子武器的国家采取同样措施，以保证永远普遍停止原子武器和氢武器的试验。这一大胆的行动，向全世界宣告了，只要大国有诚意，停止核武器试验是完全可能的。那样就会进一步促进国际间的互相信任，禁止使用和生产核武器，使人类摆脱对和平命运、对人类子孙命运的忧虑。现在的问题只看拥有原子武器的美英两国如何了。
    美国和英国的统治集团已经拒绝了苏联的呼吁。这几天里，艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯以至美国的国务院官员们，先后表示了不肯停止试验核武器。麦克米伦也为英国继续进行核武器的爆炸试验辩解。他们甚至还胡说核武器试验可以秘密进行而不为外国所觉察，企图冲淡苏联这一行动所产生的政治影响。这就说明了要停止核武器试验，还有待于一切爱好和平人民的不屈不挠的斗争。
    在英国，自从美英签订建立火箭基地的协定之后，英国人民已经广泛地开展了反对建立火箭基地的斗争。卷进这一运动的，包括了广大劳动人民、知识分子，以至统治阶级内部一部分头脑清醒的人士。英国许多工会组织、伦敦大学的二百零四名教授，先后要求政府停止试验核武器，制止载有氢弹的美国飞机在英国上空飞行，反对建立火箭基地。4月4日，英国人民举行和平大示威。法国和意大利人民，也激烈地反对政府建立火箭基地的计划。在德国，由于西德联邦议院通过了用原子武器装备军队的决议，西德政府并且已经宣布向美国购买第一批导弹。对于西德政府的这种倒行逆施，德国人民掀起了抗议的怒潮。民主德国政府和德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希发表声明，谴责西德政府的决定，是对德国人民和一切其他国家人民安全和和平的进攻，是向最高级会议和德国和平统一射出一枚鱼雷。民主德国全国阵线号召全德人民团结一致，反对原子军备。德国共产党第一书记雷曼号召西德人民展开全民性抵抗运动。西德各界人士曾在法兰克福举行了大会，抗议阿登纳政府在西德实行原子武装的政策，号召“同原子死亡作斗争”。西德工会号召举行总罢工，西德社会民主党要求阿登纳政府下台。深受战争灾难的德国人民坚决反对阿登纳的好战政策。
    苏联停止试验氢弹的决定，大大鼓舞全世界人民要求停止试验核武器的勇气和决心。4月份，要求停止试验核武器的运动，将会有更加广阔的发展。
    美国陷入经济衰退的深渊不能自拔
    3月26日，美国总统艾森豪威尔为了稳定人心，又一次说：“美国经济下降的最低点已经临近，也可能现在已经到了”，可是实际情况却是越来越不妙。
    3月份美国工业生产继续下降。钢铁工业的开工率平均只有50％左右，好几个大钢铁厂被迫减产和停产，“福特公司”的罗格河钢铁厂、“全国钢铁公司”底特律地区工厂都要停产三个星期。汽车工业和石油工业的生产是这个月份缩减得最厉害的，比起2月份来，汽车生产减少9％，石油减少8％。
    失业工人继续在增加，估计3月份又增加了二三十万人。可是，物价仍在上涨，美国生活费用指数2月份又升到一百二十二点五的新高峰（1947—1949年的平均数为一百），工人的实际工资比一年前下降了5％。
    美国著名经济学家佩洛认为，生产过剩危机的阶段已经光临美国，可能成为世界资本主义大规模经济危机的开端。“纽约时报”也不得不承认，“经济危机是资本主义制度的痼疾”，“无法逃避的生活现实”。
    美国政府在严重的经济衰退面前，竭力想采取各种办法，来阻止衰退的继续。这半个月里，提出“第一号反衰退计划”，拨款十八亿五千多万美元，来兴建住宅；“第二号反衰退计划”，拨款五十五亿美元来建筑公路。艾森豪威尔提出了要动用五—六亿美元的政府基金，延长失业工人领取救济金的期限，4月2日又要求国会增加十四亿五千五百万美元的军事拨款。美国几家最大的汽车公司经理，商定要搞一个“推销运动”来推销汽车。各方面要求减税的呼声也很高，产联—劳联已两次提出要求减税六十亿到八十亿美元。由于美国垄断集团利害的不一致，对付经济衰退的办法也各有千秋，美国政府内部、共和党和民主党之间的互相攻讦和争吵，也越来越激烈。
    经济衰退，已经波及到整个资本主义世界。好多西方国家通货膨胀，物价上涨，实际工资减少，使得工人的生活越来越困难。这半个月里，要求增加工资的罢工斗争激烈起来。法国继罗利昂、圣亚田、布勒斯特等许多工业城市的罢工之后，4月1日爆发了一百万工人的大罢工，铁路、煤气、电力都告中断。这些国有工业工人要求增加20％的工资。在西德和西柏林，3月19日也发生了三十五万公用事业工人的大罢工，使一百五十多个大小城市的公共交通断绝，水、电、煤气完全停止供应。日本工人要求改善待遇的春季斗争，也达到了高潮，3月27日，开始了大规模的第四次联合行动，铁路、煤矿、港湾、合成化学等等部门的工人，都卷进了斗争。21日起在“三井”、“三菱”等四家大公司的十五个矿山中开始的无限期重点罢工还在继续进行。
    反殖民主义的大示威和反对干涉内政的斗争
    在这半个月里，亚非地区反殖民主义的斗争在两个方面有了新的发展。
    3月30日，“声援阿尔及利亚日”，在亚非各国形成了轰轰烈烈的反对殖民主义、支持阿尔及利亚人民的大示威。阿拉伯联合共和国、突尼斯、利比亚、苏联、中国、越南、朝鲜、蒙古、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦、锡兰各国都举行了各种集会，有的国家还进行了募捐。亚非人民对于阿尔及利亚人民英勇的反殖民主义斗争，一致表示了热情的支持，强烈谴责法国的殖民政策，要求承认阿尔及利亚的独立，并通过谈判，解决阿尔及利亚问题。无疑的，这将给予阿尔及亚人民以及正在为反殖民主义而斗争的一切亚非人民以极大的鼓舞。正像阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的一位领袖阿巴斯在开罗所说的：“我们再不是孤单的了，我们已经不是生活在1830年（法国侵占阿尔及利亚一的年）了。”“阿尔及利亚人民是为独立而斗争，他们必将胜利。因为他们对自己的胜利充满了信心。”
    在印度尼西亚，一个广泛的反对美国干涉内政的运动正在展开。
    印度尼西亚政府军登陆中苏门答腊以后，节节胜利。现在政府军已经全部肃清了东苏门答腊的叛军，进入西苏门答腊，正在准备摧毁叛军的最后巢穴——巴东和武吉丁宜。叛军已经呈现出土崩瓦解的情势，当政府军收复基利兰德耀的时候，就有一营叛军投诚。
    政府军在战斗中缴获了大量的武器，其中有迫击炮、火箭炮、各式自动步枪，都是美国造的。这些武器，是由DC4式的美国运输机空投来的，也有的是从菲律宾、新加坡偷运进去的。最近揭发的材料进一步证实了美国在利用被它霸占的我国的领土台湾作为一个活动基地，对印度尼西亚进行着干涉。美国指使蒋介石集团供给印度尼西亚叛军武器。最近，南朝鲜的李承晚集团，也公开叫嚣支援印度尼西亚的叛军，并且叫嚣要派“远征军”去。看来，美国自己不敢公然出面支持印度尼西亚叛军，却采取了更加阴险的计划，指使蒋介石和李承晚集团来直接干涉印度尼西亚的内政。
    美国和东南亚条约组织的干涉，已经激起了印度尼西亚人民极大的愤怒。3月下旬以来，印度尼西亚人民掀起了反对美国和东南亚条约组织干涉内政的群众运动。全印度尼西亚中央职工会号召工厂、种植园、矿山和码头的职工，谴责美国和东南亚条约组织干涉别国内政，要求封闭在印度尼西亚的台湾蒋介石集团的机构。3月23日，美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的墙上出现了“人民反对东南亚条约组织干涉印度尼西亚”的大标语。接着，雅加达的大学生和农民阵线等群众组织，纷纷到美大使馆门前示威，递抗议书。泗水的学生到美国领事馆门前示威。中苏门答腊捍卫印度尼西亚共和国统一斗争者团结合作会、明南族（叛军窃据的巴东地区的民族）协会主席，都一致谴责外国的干涉，指责美国煽起了这次叛乱。
    觉醒了的印度尼西亚人民，是绝对不会容忍美国及其走狗蒋介石集团和李承晚集团的干涉的。中国和亚洲的人民必将继续全力支持印度尼西亚政府和人民反对外来干涉的斗争。
