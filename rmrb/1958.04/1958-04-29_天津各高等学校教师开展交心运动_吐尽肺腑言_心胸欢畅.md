    Tianjin Higher Education Institutions' Teachers Launch "Heart-to-Heart" Movement
    Pouring Out Their Innermost Thoughts, Hearts and Minds are Cheerful
    (Our Newspaper News) Teachers in Tianjin's higher education institutions have rapidly launched a movement to open their hearts to the Party and the people. The movement adopts a gentle and gradual approach, starting from the desire for unity, undergoing criticism, and achieving a new unity.
    In order to thoroughly carry out ideological self-remolding, teachers in various schools have adopted diverse forms such as posting big-character posters, holding discussion meetings, and heart-to-heart talks. Teachers in the Chemistry Department of Nankai University are helping each other through "individual medical consultations and collective diagnosis"; Tianjin Normal College held an exhibition of "Ideological Remolding, Striving for Redness and Expertise"; some departments also held ideological exchange meetings between teachers or between teachers and students, to enlighten and help each other.
    During the movement, some teachers talked about many ideological situations that they had never discussed with even their best friends or even their wives in the past. Some teachers at Nankai University confessed that they used to hate talking about ideology, and only discussed theories, current affairs, and professional matters with their best friends. Now, he has also exposed his deeply hidden thoughts and examined his erroneous views and bourgeois fame and profit-seeking ideas during the period of great blooming and contending. Some teachers in the Architecture Department of Tianjin University, although outwardly agreeing with being both "red and expert," actually thought in their hearts that "expertise" was their bread and butter, and "redness" was only to gain the trust of the leadership; this time, they also talked about this kind of thinking.
    Chen Rongti, a professor in the Chemistry Department of Nankai University, was very disgusted with the big-character posters criticizing his bourgeois teaching ideology by young teachers and students in the previous stage of rectification. This time, he took the initiative to post big-character posters exposing his bourgeois thoughts, standpoints, and viewpoints, and hung up a "critical care" sign, inviting everyone to "consult" and help him conduct criticism.
    Many teachers felt refreshed after expressing their inner thoughts. Some teachers said that in the past, they kept their words to themselves, acting one way in person and another behind people's backs. Now, exposing their wrong ideas and being determined to overcome them makes them feel relieved. In the past, disunity among teachers was quite common, even seriously affecting work. In this movement, many lively scenes of "generals and ministers reconciled" have emerged because each person has examined their own individualistic thoughts. Some teachers also felt that their thoughts were too dirty, and therefore temporarily lost confidence in the future. After the Party organizations in various units talked to them, affirmed their strengths, and pointed out that being able to bravely expose past mistakes was the beginning of progress, they gained confidence and strength to remold themselves.
    The rapid development of this heart-to-heart movement clearly reflects the political situation of bourgeois intellectuals in the intermediate state turning to the left. Yang Zhijiu, a professor in the History Department of Nankai University, reviewed his support for the rightist Lei Haizong's attack on the Party during the blooming and contending period, saying: "If it weren't for the Party's leadership in the anti-rightist struggle to save me, I would have likely fallen into the mire of sin and been unable to extricate myself." He is determined to "thoroughly correct his past mistakes, start from scratch, undergo a complete transformation, and remold himself." Many teachers have gained a deeper understanding of the issue of redness versus expertise through the heart-to-heart movement, realizing that as an intellectual, if one is not "red," it will be difficult to exert their due role in socialist construction. Li Guangbi, a professor in the History Department, said after opening his heart: "After seeing the more than one hundred facts I confessed, it is truly fitting to say that I am a bourgeois intellectual." Hu Shixiang, director of the Psychology Teaching and Research Office, used to be at odds with the Party, but now expresses his willingness to strive for Party education.

### 天津各高等学校教师开展交心运动  吐尽肺腑言　心胸欢畅

    天津各高等学校教师开展交心运动
    吐尽肺腑言　心胸欢畅
    本报讯　天津市各高等学校的教师们迅速开展了向党向人民交心的运动。运动采取的方式是和风细雨，从团结的愿望出发，经过批评，达到新的团结的目的。
    为了彻底地进行自我思想改造，各校教师都采取了贴大字报、开座谈会、谈心等多种多样的形式。南开大学化学系的教师们以“个人求医，集体会诊”的方式互相进行帮助；天津师范学院举办了“思想改造、奔向红专”的展览会；有的系还召开了教师之间或师生之间的思想交流会，彼此启发帮助。
    在运动中，有些教师谈出来的许多思想情况，过去连自己最要好的朋友、甚至妻子也不谈的。南开大学有的教师检查说，过去最讨厌谈思想，对最好的朋友也只是谈谈理论，谈谈时事和谈谈业务。现在他也把自己隐藏得很深的思想暴露出来，检查了自己在大鸣大放中的错误观点和资产阶级名利思想。天津大学建筑系有的教师过去表面上虽然赞成又红又专，实际上心里想，“专”是看家本领，“红”只是为了取得领导上的信任；这一次也把这种思想谈了出来。
    南开大学化学系教授陈荣悌，在前一个阶段的整改中对于青年教师和学生批评他资产阶级教学思想的大字报十分反感。这一次他却自动地贴大字报揭露自己的资产阶级思想、立场和观点，并且挂了“急诊”，邀请大家来“会诊”，帮助他进行批判。
    许多教师在说出了心里的话以后，都有一种心情舒畅的感觉。有的教师说，过去把话憋在肚子里，当面一套，背后一套，现在把错误的思想暴露出来，下决心把它克服掉，心里就痛快了。过去在教师中间不团结的现象相当多，甚至严重影响了工作。在这次运动中，由于各自检查了自己的个人主义思想，出现了许多“将相和”的生动场面。也有一些教师感到自己的思想太肮脏了，因此一时对前途失去信心。经过各单位的党组织找他们谈话，肯定地指出他们的优点，并且指出能够自己勇于揭露过去的错误就是进步的开始，使他们获得了改造自己的信心和力量。
    从这次交心运动的迅速发展中，明显地反映出处在中间状态的资产阶级知识分子向左转的政治形势。南开大学历史系教授杨志玖检讨他在鸣放期间曾支持右派分子雷海宗向党进攻的时候说：“要不是党领导的反右派斗争挽救了我，我很有可能堕落到罪恶的泥坑里去，而不能自拔。”他决心要“痛改前非，从头作起，脱胎换骨，改造自己”。许多教师通过交心运动对红与专的问题有了更深刻的理解，认识到作为一个知识分子，如果不“红”，那就很难在社会主义建设中发挥自己应有的作用。历史系教授李光璧交心后说：“看到了交出的一百多条事实，再说我是资产阶级知识分子，真是名副其实。”心理教研室主任胡士襄过去同党总是格格不入，而现在却表示愿意争取党的教育。
