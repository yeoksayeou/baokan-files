    Accepting Passenger Opinions
    No Visa Required for Changing Trains in Shenyang
    During the rectification campaign, the Shenyang Railway Bureau accepted the opinions of the majority of passengers and decided to gradually abolish the passenger train change visa system at railway transfer stations. They first piloted this at Shenyang Railway Station for five months, which proved that abolishing the train change visa system does not affect railway transportation order and is indeed very convenient for passengers. Therefore, the Shenyang Railway Bureau decided that, starting from April 1st, the transit passenger train change visa system will be abolished at fourteen transfer stations within the bureau's jurisdiction, including Shenyang, Changchun, and Siping.

    接受旅客意见
    沈阳换车不用签证
    整风期间，沈阳铁路管理局接受广大旅客意见，决定逐步取消铁路中转站旅客换车签证制度。他们先在沈阳车站试行了五个月，证明取消换车签证制度并不影响铁路运输秩序，而确实对旅客很方便。因此，沈阳铁路管理局决定：从4月1日起，将在这个局管辖范围内的沈阳、长春和四平等十四个换乘站取消中转旅客换车签证制度。
