In the great period of socialist construction, not only do cadres on the production front need to be both red and expert, but also cadres on other fronts serving production construction need to be both red and expert. Judicial workers are certainly no exception. Everyone knows that the superstructure is produced by the economic base and determined by the economic base. However, the superstructure does not merely passively reflect its economic base and plays no active role. On the contrary, once the superstructure is produced, it will become a huge force to consolidate and develop its own economic base, a huge force to actively help the new system, eradicate and eliminate the old economic base and ruling class, and a huge force to liberate productive forces and develop production. Our law is one of the superstructures of our economic base and is intended to serve socialist construction. Its main task at present is to protect production from all aspects, promote production, and fight against all behaviors that undermine production. Our judicial workers must be good at mastering and using this weapon. If the struggle against counter-revolutionaries and serious criminals who undermine socialist construction and production is not timely and the crackdown is not strong enough, production cannot be protected; if disputes among the people are not resolved in a timely manner and handled improperly, it will also affect production. To master and use the weapon of law well, judicial workers must be both red and expert. Red means communist ideology and politics, and expert means specialized business and technology. The Party Central Committee requires us to achieve the unity of politics and technology, and not to be practical people who lose their direction, nor to be empty politicians. Especially our judicial workers must do this even more. Law is different from other technologies, and its relationship with politics is particularly close. It is a form of political expression, and it is the formalization of policies and guidelines. All laws are subject to politics and are formulated to achieve political goals and adapt to political requirements. Therefore, judicial work, this so-called specialized business, is the work of implementing laws, as well as the work of implementing policies and guidelines and realizing politics and ideology. If judicial workers are not red, they cannot be expert (if they are not red experts, they can only be white "experts" or gray "experts"), and if they are not expert, they will not use the law to implement policies and guidelines, realize political goals, and will easily be fooled by others in politics and ideology, and even be disarmed by the enemy.

The problems faced by judicial workers are very complex. There are problems of contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, and there are also problems of contradictions among the people; there are major issues of right and wrong belonging to the two roads, and there are also individual disputes and local interests between this organ and that organ, this person and that person on the same socialist road. The resolution of each problem reflects the position, viewpoint, and method of the person solving the problem; whether each problem is resolved well or not also depends on the position, viewpoint, and method of the person solving the problem. People who are "neither red nor expert" cannot solve problems well because of their unstable positions, incorrect viewpoints, and inappropriate methods. Sometimes they are extremely lenient to the targets of the dictatorship, and sometimes they are not good at using the method of persuasion and education when dealing with problems among the people, but are accustomed to adopting compulsory and repressive methods. For example, on the issue of eliminating counter-revolutionaries, Chairman Mao once clearly instructed: "Raise vigilance, eliminate all secret agents; prevent deviations, and do not wrong a good person." However, some people seized the second sentence, discarded the first sentence, corrected deviations but not omissions, and protected counter-revolutionaries as good people. For counter-revolutionary murderers, if they were the ones who issued the orders, they would be lenient on the grounds that the victims were killed by others. If they were the executioners who killed with their own hands, they would be lenient on the grounds that they were carrying out the orders of others; for counter-revolutionaries who sent out reactionary documents, as long as the documents had not yet reached their destination, they would be treated as attempted crimes. For counter-revolutionaries who wrote reactionary slogans, as long as they did not admit that their purpose was counter-revolutionary, they would not be treated as counter-revolutionaries. For example, Chairman Mao instructed us: "Dictatorship must also be exercised over those thieves, swindlers, arsonists, hooligan gangs, and various bad elements who seriously disrupt social order." However, some people believe that the behavior of these people belongs to the scope of contradictions among the people and should not be severely punished. On the other hand, small disputes among the people, which the people could have mediated themselves, must also be brought to trial; and those that could have been educated, persuaded, and mediated, must also be given "legal sanctions." What needs to be particularly pointed out is that these people also use so-called "judicial independence" and "supreme supervision" to resist the leadership of the Party, and want to make the judicial organs an independent kingdom. Regardless of their subjective intentions, objectively they have brought great losses to the country and the people.

When it comes to expertise, some people think that they must have read many legal works, memorized many legal provisions, and understood a large set of complicated and trivial procedures and formalities. In particular, those "experts" with strong old legal views who have dabbled in some Marxist-Leninist literature after liberation want to stick their tails up. They think that they can both "inherit the legacy" and move the dogmas, both plate with capitalist gold and take the socialist scriptures, and can be called experts in both Chinese and foreign affairs, and are very arrogant. In their eyes, where are the general old cadres and new cadres? And some old cadres and new cadres are frightened by them, and even captured! In the 1953 judicial reform movement, the old legal views were severely attacked, and these "experts" disappeared for a while. However, the old legal views cannot be eliminated all at once, and they will make a comeback when they have the opportunity. From 1956 to the first half of 1957, the old legal views raised their heads again. In particular, the rightists, under the banner of so-called academic discussions, carried out a frenzied attack. In the newspapers and magazines in Shanghai and Beijing, on the debate on issues such as the so-called "legal inheritance" and "presumption of innocence," the old legal views gained the upper hand. The struggle against the rightists has achieved great victories, and the old legal views have once again been severely attacked, but have not been completely wiped out. Ideological struggle is a long-term one, and on this ideological front, there is still a need for cadres with strong political and ideological abilities and certain theoretical and professional abilities to continue fighting. Under the current emphasis on being both red and expert, the old legal views are not absolutely impossible to be revived. Among the "experts," aren't some people still taking advantage of "expertise" to exploit loopholes? For example, the "presumption of innocence" was originally theoretically wrong and practically harmful, but the "experts" still do not give up on it. They say: "The source of 'presumption of innocence' is the 'Declaration of Human Rights,' and the 'Declaration of Human Rights' is progressive, so 'presumption of innocence' is also progressive." They advocate: "We should pick up and use the progressive things that the bourgeoisie has abandoned." The so-called "presumption of innocence" means that in all links of investigation, prosecution, and trial (public security organs, procuratorates, and courts), the defendant should first be presumed to be innocent and a good person, and neither should he be considered guilty nor should he be suspected of being guilty. Obviously, in our country, advocating the "presumption of innocence" is harmful. Anyone with a little Marxist-Leninist common sense understands that what is progressive in a certain stage of historical development becomes reactionary or backward in another stage of historical development. Indeed, the "Declaration of Human Rights" played a progressive role in the bourgeoisie's democratic revolution against the feudal system. But for the socialist system, it is reactionary because it reflects selfish property relations. When the people of our country had not yet seized power and were carrying out revolutionary struggles under reactionary rule, advocating litigation theories that were beneficial to the defendant, as a weapon of "legal struggle," was also beneficial to the revolution. But after the people have seized power and the people have become the masters of the country, singing the "presumption of innocence" is aimless and meaningless. On the other hand, class enemies still exist, and counter-revolutionary activities have not been completely eliminated. Singing the "presumption of innocence" is bound to bind the hands and feet of the people and facilitate the enemy, which is harmful to the people's democratic dictatorship. Isn't it the rightists who have taken up this weapon to carry out "legal struggle" against us?

The "presumption of innocence" is not only harmful in practice and reactionary in politics, but also wrong in theory and unscientific. The "presumption of innocence" says that before a defendant is convicted, if he is not presumed to be innocent, he must be presumed to be guilty, and one of the two must be the case. "Presumption of guilt" is subjectivism that leads people to crime, so the "presumption of innocence" must be taken as an important principle of criminal proceedings. In fact, whether the defendant commits a crime or not is an objective existence. The public security organs, procuratorial organs, and courts, through investigation, collection of evidence, prosecution, defense, trial, and other activities, come to understand this objective existence and judge whether the defendant is guilty or not. Presuming guilt in advance is subjectivism, and presuming innocence is also subjectivism. As long as there is a one-sided presumption in advance, instead of comprehensively examining the problem from both positive and negative aspects and collecting evidence in a realistic manner, a judgment that is inconsistent with the objective reality will inevitably be produced. Why is there still a market for goods like "presumption of innocence"? This is because some judicial workers and even people who study law do not recognize the goods and are not knowledgeable. According to statistics at the end of 1956, 60% of the judicial cadres in the country participated in the work after liberation in 1949. They lacked revolutionary struggle experience, production knowledge, and labor experience. Generally speaking, they rarely achieved "both red and expert." Old cadres are strong politically, but some people, due to being divorced from reality and the masses, have become "neither red nor expert"; as for a small number of people with bad qualities and political degeneration, they have simply become rightists. Therefore, we must rectify our ranks of judicial workers and cultivate our "both red and expert" judicial workers. In this way, we can eliminate the market for old legal views such as the "presumption of innocence" and make it impossible for them to be revived.

The standards for experts and professionals that we need are by no means reading a few more books, memorizing some more articles, and understanding some more procedures and formalities, but rather requiring the use of Marxist-Leninist positions, viewpoints, and methods to solve the problems that occur and exist in socialist construction based on our country's current economic base and social conditions. How can we become such experts and professionals? First of all, we must stand firm on the position of the proletariat and resolutely obey the leadership of the Party. Facts have proved that where the judicial organs obey the leadership of the Party, there are fewer wrong cases; where the judicial organs do not obey the leadership of the Party, there are more wrong cases. Judicial workers who do not stand firm on the proletarian position and do not obey the leadership of the Party cannot talk about being "red" and "expert." Secondly, we must study Marxist-Leninist theory to guide practice; we must also have knowledge of law. Reading books is not useless. However, if we are divorced from reality, read books behind closed doors, and regard books as golden rules, we will make the mistake of dogmatism. Legal knowledge in books is only material for our reference or selection, and we should not be bound by it. We must recognize that laws and various legal theories are reflections of economic relations. As Engels said: "Economic relations are reflected in legal principles"; "Jurists think that they are acting according to a priori principles, but this is nothing but a reflection of the economy." What kind of economic system is there, what kind of law is there, and there are also theories that explain, develop, and elaborate this law. These laws and theories are not immutable and universally applicable. Therefore, if judicial workers do not understand our country's current economic base and production situation, or have no production knowledge or economic knowledge at all, then even if they have read thousands of books, they cannot become "both red and expert" judicial cadres that the country needs. In order to truly combine theory with practice, in order to truly understand the economic base and social situation, and to obtain extensive knowledge and experience, our judicial workers must study in practice, in battle, and among the masses, and study in the actual life of the masses. Theory can guide practice, but whether it is truly useful needs to be proved in practice. Theory comes from practice and is proved by practice. Practice can test theory, enrich theory, and generate new theories. Similarly, knowledge comes from practice, as Chairman Mao instructed us: "If you want to have knowledge, you must participate in the practice of transforming reality"; "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is even more important learning"; "Doing is learning." Therefore, to become "both red and expert" judicial workers, we mainly rely on learning in practice. There can be various specific methods, but for judicial cadres above the middle level, especially leading cadres, running "experimental fields" is the most important and effective method. It can improve our working methods and realize what Chairman Mao said: "Combining the general with the individual, and combining the leadership with the masses." It should be affirmed that running "experimental fields" is the road to being both red and expert, and we must conscientiously advance along this road.

    司法工作者需要又红又专
    韩幽桐
    在伟大的社会主义建设时期，不仅生产战线上的干部需要又红又专，而且在为生产建设服务的其他战线上的干部也同样需要又红又专。司法工作者当然也不能例外。谁都知道，上层建筑是由经济基础产生，为经济基础所决定的。但是上层建筑对于自己的经济基础，不是仅仅消极反映，不起积极作用。相反地，上层建筑一经产生，就要成为巩固和发展自己的经济基础的巨大力量，就要成为积极帮助新制度，铲除和消灭旧的经济基础和统治阶级的巨大力量，就要成为解放生产力，发展生产的巨大力量。我们的法律是我们的经济基础的上层建筑之一，是要为社会主义建设服务的。它目前的主要任务是从各方面保卫生产，促进生产，同一切破坏生产的行为作斗争。我们司法工作者必须善于掌握和运用这个武器。如果对破坏社会主义建设和破坏生产的反革命分子和严重的犯罪分子斗争不及时，打击不力，就不能保卫生产；对人民中间的纠纷解决不及时，处理不恰当，也就会影响生产。要把法律这个武器掌握和运用得好，司法工作者就必须又红又专。红就是共产主义的思想和政治，专就是专门的业务和技术。党中央要求我们实现政治和技术的统一，既不要作迷失方向的实际家，也不要作空头政治家。特别是我们司法工作者更必须这样作。法律和其他的技术不同，它本身和政治的关系特别密切。它是政治的一种表现形式，是政策、方针的定型化。一切法律都是服从政治的，都是为了实现政治目的、适应政治要求而制定的。因此，司法工作这一种所谓专门业务，是执行法律的工作，也是执行政策方针，实现政治、思想的工作。司法工作者不红就不可能专（不是红色专家，就只能是白色的“专家”，或者灰色的“专家”），而不专也就不会运用法律来贯彻政策方针，实现政治目的，并且在政治、思想上容易上别人的当，甚至被敌人缴械。
    司法工作者面对着的问题是很复杂的。有敌我矛盾问题，也有人民内部矛盾问题；有属于两条道路的大是大非问题，也有属于一条社会主义道路上的这个机关和那个机关、这个人和那个人之间发生的个别争执，局部利益方面的问题。每一个问题的解决，都反映着解决问题的人的立场、观点、方法；每一个问题解决得好或不好，也决定于解决问题的人的立场、观点、方法。“不红不专”的人由于立场不稳，观点不正确，方法不恰当，不可能把问题解决得好。他们有时对专政对象宽大无边，有时在处理人民内部问题时不善于运用说服教育的方法，而惯于采取强制的、压服的方法。例如在肃反问题上，毛主席曾经明白指示：“提高警惕，肃清一切特务分子；防止偏差，不要冤枉一个好人。”但是有些人却抓住第二句，抛掉第一句，纠偏不纠漏，把反革命分子也当做好人保护了。对反革命杀人犯，如果是发号施令的人，就以被害者是别人所杀为理由，给予宽大。如果是亲手杀人的刽子手，则又以他是执行别人命令为理由，给予宽大；对寄发反动文件的反革命分子，只要文件还没有寄到目的地，就按未遂犯处理。对写反动标语的反革命分子，只要本人不承认以反革命为目的，就不按反革命处理。又如毛主席指示我们：“对于那些盗窃犯，诈骗犯，杀人放火犯，流氓集团和各种严重破坏社会秩序的坏分子，也必须实行专政。”但是有些人却认为这些人的行为属于人民内部矛盾的范围，不应当严惩。另一方面，对于人民中间的小纠纷，本来是人民可以自行调处的，也要拿来审判；本来可以教育说服调解了事的，也要给予“法律制裁”。特别需要指出的，是这些人还拿所谓“司法独立”，“最高监督”来对抗党的领导，要使司法机关成为独立王国。不管他们主观上怎样，客观上已给国家和人民带来很大的损失。
    一说到专，有些人便以为必须读过很多法学著作，背熟许多法律条文，懂得一大套繁杂琐细的程序和手续。特别是那些旧法观点浓厚、解放后多少涉猎一些马列主义文献的“专家”，更要翘起尾巴来了。他们自以为既能“继承遗产”，又会搬运教条，既镀资本主义之金，又取社会主义之经，真称得起学通中外，道贯古今，大有不可一世之概。他们的眼睛里头，那里有一般老干部和新干部？而有些老干部和新干部竟被他们吓唬住，甚至被俘虏！在1953年司法改革运动中，旧法观点受到严重打击，这些“专家们”一度消声匿迹。但是旧法观点，不可能一下子就被消除，一有机会它便卷土重来。1956年到1957年上半年，旧法观点又抬起头来。特别是右派分子，打着所谓学术讨论的旗帜，进行疯狂的进攻。在上海、北京的报纸杂志上，关于所谓“法律继承性”、“无罪推定论”等问题的争论，旧法观点竟占了上风。反右派斗争取得了巨大的胜利，旧法观点再度受到严重打击，但是还没有完全被歼灭。思想斗争是长期性的，在这一条思想战线上，也还需要有政治强、思想强、有一定理论和业务能力的干部继续作战。在目前强调又红又专的情况下，旧法观点不是绝对没有死灰复燃的可能。在“专家们”中间，不是有人还在利用“又专”来钻空子吗？例如“无罪推定论”，本来是在理论上错误，在实际上有害的东西，但是“专家们”却直到现在，仍不放弃。他们说：“‘无罪推定’的来源是‘人权宣言’，‘人权宣言’是进步的，因而‘无罪推定’也是进步的。”他们主张：“资产阶级抛弃了的进步的东西，我们应当拾起来，应当利用它。”所谓“无罪推定”，就是在侦查、起诉、审判的各个环节（公安机关、检察院、法院）上，对于被告人都应当首先推定他是无罪的好人，既不能认为他有罪，也不能怀疑他有罪。很明显，在我们的国家，高唱“无罪推定论”是有害的。稍有马列主义常识的人都懂得，在某一个历史发展阶段上是进步的东西，在另一个历史发展阶段上却成为反动的或者落后的东西。的确，“人权宣言”在资产阶级反对封建制度的民主革命过程中是起了进步作用的。但是对社会主义制度来说，则是反动的，因为它是反映着自私自利的财产关系的。在我国人民还没有取得政权而在反动统治下进行着革命斗争的时候，提倡有利于被告人的诉讼理论，作为“合法斗争”的武器，对于革命也是有利的。但是在人民已经取得政权，人民成了国家的主人翁后，高唱“无罪推定论”，就是无的放矢，毫无意义的了。另一方面，阶级敌人还存在，反革命活动还没有完全消灭，高唱“无罪推定论”，就必然束缚人民的手脚，而便利了敌人，对于人民民主专政是有害的。右派分子不正是拿起这个武器向我们进行“合法斗争”吗？
    “无罪推定论”不仅在实际上是有害的，在政治上是反动的，而且在理论上也是错误的，是不科学的。“无罪推定论”说，被告人在判决以前，如果不推定他是无罪的，就要推定他是有罪的，二者必居其一，而“有罪推定”是入人于罪的主观主义，因而必须把“无罪推定”作为刑事诉讼的重要原则。其实，被告人犯罪或者不犯罪是客观存在。公安机关、检察机关和法院，是通过侦查、搜集证据、起诉、辩护、审判等等活动，来认识这个客观存在，判断被告人犯罪或者不犯罪的。事先推定有罪是主观主义，推定无罪，同样是主观主义。只要是先来一个片面的推定，而不是从正反两方面全面地考察问题，实事求是地搜集证据，就必然产生主客观不一致的判断。像“无罪推定论”这样的货色，为什么还会有销售的市场呢？这是由于有些司法工作者以至研究法学的人们还不识货，还不内行。据1956年底统计，全国司法干部中，有60％是1949年解放后参加工作的，既缺乏革命斗争经验，也缺乏生产知识和劳动锻炼，一般地说，很少做到“又红又专”。老干部政治上是强的，但也有些人，由于脱离实际，脱离群众，变得“不红不专”；至于品质恶劣，政治蜕化的少数人，则简直成了右派分子了。因此，我们必须整顿我们司法工作者的队伍，培养我们的“又红又专”的司法工作者。这样，才能消灭“无罪推定论”等旧法观点的市场，使它没有死灰复燃的可能。
    我们所需要的内行、专家的标准，决不是多读几本书，多记一些条文，多懂一些程序和手续，而是要求根据我国目前的经济基础，社会情况，用马列主义的立场、观点、方法来解决社会主义建设中所发生和存在着的问题。怎样才能成为这样的内行、专家呢？首先，必须站稳无产阶级的立场，坚决服从党的领导。事实证明，那里的司法机关服从党的领导，那里错案就少；那里的司法机关不服从党的领导，那里错案就多。司法工作者不站稳无产阶级立场，不服从党的领导，就谈不到“红”和“专”。其次，要学习马列主义的理论来指导实践；也要具有法学方面的知识。读书并不是没有用处。但是，如果脱离实际，闭门读书，把书本奉为金科玉律，那就要犯教条主义的错误。书本上的法学知识不过是供我们参考或选用的资料，更不应当受它的拘束。必须认识：法律和各种有关法律的学说，都是经济关系的反映。正像恩格斯所说：“经济关系反映为法权原则”；“法学家以为他是凭着先验的原理来活动，然而这无非是经济的反映而已”。有什么性质的经济制度，就有什么性质的法律，也就有解释、发挥、阐扬这种法律的学说。这些法律和学说都不是百世不变，四海皆准的。因此，司法工作者如果不了解我国目前的经济基础和生产情况，或者根本没有生产知识，没有经济方面的知识，那么，尽管读破万卷书也不能成为国家所需要的“又红又专”的司法干部。为了确实作到理论联系实际，为了真正了解经济基础和社会情况，获得广泛的知识和经验，我们司法工作者必须在实践中、在战斗中学习，到群众中去，在群众的实际生活中学习。理论可以指导实践，但是它是不是真正有用，需要在实践中证明。理论是从实践中产生，又经过实践证明的。实践可以考验理论，充实理论，并产生新的理论。同样，知识是从实践中来的，像毛主席指示我们的：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践”；“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习”；“干就是学习”。因此，要成为“又红又专”的司法工作者，主要依靠在实践中学习。具体办法可以有种种，但是就中层以上的司法干部特别是领导干部来说，搞“试验田”，是一个最主要的最有效的办法。它可以改进我们的工作方法，实现毛主席所说的：“一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合”。应当肯定：搞“试验田”是又红又专的道路，我们必须认真地沿着这条道路前进。
