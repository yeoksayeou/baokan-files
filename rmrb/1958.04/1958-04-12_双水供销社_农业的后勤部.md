They have achieved six "goods": Good service to production, good convenience for people to buy, good comprehensive purchase of agricultural and sideline products, good attitude towards customers, good diligence in running enterprises, and good leadership of small vendors.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 11th: The Shuangshui District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xinhui County has achieved six "goods" in supporting the great leap forward in agricultural production: Good service to production, good convenience for people to buy, good comprehensive purchase of agricultural and sideline products, good attitude towards customers, good diligence in running enterprises, and good leadership of small vendors. It has fully played the positive role of rural commercial departments, and the local Party committee calls it "our logistics department."

The cooperative's business is not limited to "doing as much business as there are goods." Instead, it closely revolves around the various agricultural production measures proposed by the Party in each period, trying every possible way to serve agricultural production. When the District Party Committee called for vigorous accumulation of fertilizer, the cooperative's staff immediately mobilized. On the one hand, they explained to the farmers that this year's chemical fertilizer supply could not be met, dispelling the masses' idea of waiting for chemical fertilizer. On the other hand, they visited old farmers in various agricultural cooperatives and collected thirty-one kinds of green manure and twenty kinds of native and miscellaneous fertilizers. Through holding exhibitions, displaying physical objects, and calculating fertilizer effects, they mobilized the masses to accumulate fertilizer. At the same time, they sent cadres to assist agricultural cooperatives in surveying peat soil layers with a reserve of more than 16 million dan, enough for the entire district to use for five years. They then assisted the agricultural cooperatives in the entire district in organizing joint peat soil factories to develop peat soil fertilizer on a large scale. When the District Party Committee called for doing a good job in preventing cold damage to seedlings, the cooperative's staff immediately went to various agricultural cooperatives to promote the method of using rice straw to make straw mats to cover the seedling fields, which quickly completed the task and saved the bamboo and bamboo strips used to build seedling sheds. When the District Party Committee called for agricultural technical reform, the cooperative's staff immediately mobilized various agricultural cooperatives to send carpenters, and the cooperative supplied raw materials to collectively research and manufacture various new agricultural tools and transportation equipment such as rice planting boats and aerial transport lines.

Since the end of last year, the four central stores and six supply and marketing branches of the Shuangshui District Supply and Marketing Cooperative have opened early markets and night markets every day, selling goods with lights on at both ends, so that farmers can buy things before going to work and after finishing work. The cooperative also sent some employees to lead small vendors in six market towns to form six peddler teams to deliver goods to the fields and construction sites, participating in labor while doing business. In this way, the masses can buy all kinds of daily necessities without having to go to the market, saving a lot of time. The cooperative's staff are also assigned to contact various agricultural cooperatives, and through planting experimental fields and participating in the agricultural cooperative's labor production, they learn about the materials needed in rural areas and the growth and market time of agricultural and sideline products. They report the situation at any time, and the District Supply and Marketing Cooperative distributes tasks according to actual needs. This ensures that sales and purchases can be done in a timely manner. In terms of purchasing work, on-the-spot purchasing in the fields and door-to-door purchasing in villages are also implemented. The employees participate in labor production, integrate with the farmers, and serve the farmers with a sincere and warm attitude. Some employees who had poor service attitudes in the past are now praised by the masses.

The Shuangshui District Supply and Marketing Cooperative is also gradually promoting the "four-package" responsibility system in various central stores and supply and marketing branches, which further promotes employees to improve their service attitude and actively implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in running enterprises. The "four packages" are: package turnover, package loss, package expenses, and package capital turnover. These four quotas are interconnected. The main feature is to combine collective interests with individual interests, which is conducive to improving business management and can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of employees. Since the implementation of the "four-package" responsibility system in the non-staple food store for five months, the number of employees has been reduced from the original fourteen to nine, the average monthly increase in turnover has been 25%, the commodity loss rate has been reduced from 0.45% in the past to about 0.1%, and the expense rate has also been greatly reduced. The handling fee alone has been reduced by 70%, and the capital turnover has been accelerated by about 20%.

    双水供销社——农业的后勤部
    他们做到了六好：服务生产观点好；便利群众购买好；全面收购农副产品好；对待顾客态度好；勤俭办企业好；领导小商贩好。
    据新华社广州11日电　新会县双水区供销合作社在支援农业生产大跃进中，做到六好：服务生产观点好，便利群众购买好，全面收购农副产品好，对待顾客态度好，勤俭办企业好，以及领导小商贩好；充分发挥了农村商业部门的积极作用，当地党委称它为“我们的后勤部”。
    这个区供销社的业务，不是限于“有多少货做多少生意”，而是紧紧围绕着党在每个时期提出的各项农业生产措施，想尽一切办法来为农业生产服务。当中共区委会号召大力积肥的时候，供销社的职工马上动员起来，一方面把今年化学肥料供应量不能满足的情况向农民进行解释，打消群众等待化学肥料的思想；一方面在各个农业社访问老农，采集了绿肥三十一种、土杂肥二十种，通过举办展览会，摆实物、算肥效，发动群众积肥。同时还派干部协助农业社勘查出蕴藏量一千六百多万担的泥炭土层，足够全区用五年，并随即协助全区的农业社组织联营泥炭土厂，大量开发泥炭土肥。当中共区委会号召做好秧苗防寒工作的时候，供销社的职工马上分头到各个农业社推广用禾草结制草席盖秧地的办法，既迅速完成了任务，又节省了架搭秧棚用的竹篾。当中共区委会号召进行农业技术改革的时候，供销社的职工就马上去发动各个农业社派出木工，由供销社供应原材料，集体研究制造了插秧船、空中运输线等各种新式农具和运输工具。
    双水区供销社所属四个中心门市部和六个供销分店，从去年年底以来，每天都开早市、夜市，做到两头点灯卖货，让农民在出勤前和收工后都能买到东西。供销社还派出部分职工领导六个墟镇的小商贩组成六个货郎担队，送货到田头工地，边参加劳动边做生意。这样，群众不用赶墟也能买到各种日常需要的东西，节约了很多时间。供销社的职工还分别包干联系各个农业社，通过种试验田和参加农业社的劳动生产，了解农村需要的物资和农副产品的生长情况及上市时间，随时把情况汇报集中，由区供销社根据实际需要布置任务。这就保证能够适时做好销售和收购工作。在收购工作方面，也实行田头收购、落村上门收购。职工们在参加劳动生产中，和农民打成一片，为农民服务时态度诚恳、亲热，一些过去服务态度不好的职工，现在也得到群众的称赞。
    双水区供销社还在各个中心门市部和供销分店中逐步推行“四包”责任制，这更加促进了职工改善服务态度和积极贯彻勤俭办企业的精神。“四包”就是包营业额、包损耗、包费用、包资金周转。这四个定额是互相关连的，主要特点是使集体利益与个人利益相结合，既有利于企业改善经营管理，又能充分发挥职工的积极性。副食品门市部实行“四包”责任制五个月来，职工由原来十四人缩减为九人，营业额每月平均增加25％，货物损耗率从过去的0.45％降低到0.1％左右，费用率也大大降低了，仅搬运费一项就降低了70％，资金周转加速了20％左右。
