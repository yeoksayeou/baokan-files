    Everything should be done rhythmically. Industrial production should also have rhythm. In the Great Leap Forward, the masses are full of energy, and the situation is developing rapidly. Adjusting the rhythm of production has become a very important issue.
    When it comes to the rhythm of production, not everyone's understanding is the same. For example, some people think that in order to fight hard for three years, we should not hesitate to break all normal and correct production order. Is this understanding correct? Obviously, the hard battle itself is not the goal we are pursuing. The purpose of fighting hard is to build socialism. To achieve this goal, we must carefully consider the method of fighting hard. If the method is correct, the rhythm will be in sync. If the method is wrong, the rhythm will be chaotic.
    What is the correct method, and what is the incorrect method? There are roughly two types of hard work methods: one is simply relying on increasing labor intensity and extending working hours. This is the method of hard work by brute force and dragging time. This method is excusable for tackling an urgent task occasionally, but it is not the method we advocate. The other is to improve production management and labor organization, transform production tools, and improve production technology. This is a method of hard work with wisdom and creativity. This is the method we want to vigorously promote. At present, the practice of consciously guiding the masses to carry out creative labor to realize the leap forward plan has attracted the attention of some leaders. However, not enough attention has been paid to how to prevent the phenomenon of simply increasing labor intensity. Some people seem to think that without working overtime and increasing labor intensity, there can be no leap forward. In fact, this view is not in line with objective reality. In order to accelerate our socialist construction, the masses are enthusiastic and spontaneously extend working hours and rush to produce, which is understandable; it is also completely necessary for leaders to take advantage of the high enthusiasm of the masses, stand in front of the masses and lead the masses to work hard and rush to produce. However, the responsibility of leaders must be to further come up with various effective ways to adjust the rhythm of production labor.
    Production labor has always been rhythmic. In a day, a person's energy is always limited. After sleeping, you have to get up, and when you are tired from work, you have to sleep. No one can get up and never sleep, and no one wants to stay in bed forever and never get up. Adequate sleep and rest are the guarantee of high labor productivity. Continuous rushes will eventually reduce labor productivity.
    Perhaps some people will ask: shouldn't we break the rules? We say that the rules have already been broken. According to the usual practice, winter is the slack season for agriculture. By breaking the rules, the slack season in winter has become the busy season in winter. If there were no busy winter, how could we build so many water conservancy projects? However, breaking the rules does not mean denying the regularity of the development of things, nor does it mean denying the rhythm of production. In the direction of more, faster, better, and more economical results, exerting great effort, and striving for the upstream, advancing in waves, with slow and fast, labor and leisure, this is the natural rhythm of production labor. Slow and fast, labor and leisure are the unity of opposites. If we do not distinguish between slow and fast, labor and leisure, and only increase labor intensity with one effort, with only fast and labor, but without slow and leisure, that is contrary to objective laws. Fighting a war also has its rhythm. When commanding a war, an experienced commander is always good at using the gap between two battles to rest and reorganize. Combat and rest are also the unity of opposites. Even in a large battle, time should be taken between each battle to rest and reorganize. Rest and reorganization are not the purpose, the purpose of rest and reorganization is to invest in another battle and another battle in order to achieve greater victory. Fast and slow, labor and leisure, sleep and work, hard work and rest, are all mutually transformed. Fast is transformed into slow, and slow is transformed into fast; labor is transformed into leisure, and leisure is transformed into labor; combat is transformed into rest, and rest is transformed into combat; and so on, the principles are the same, and one can be used to infer ten.
    Denying the wave-like advancement of things and believing that production labor can do without rhythm is a one-sided subjective idealist thought, that is, a metaphysical point of view. In the eyes of metaphysics, everything is "moving constantly and static constantly," that is to say, movement and stillness are absolute. Our point of view is contrary to metaphysics. We believe that everything is constantly moving, constantly changing, and constantly developing. This process of movement is not a simple repetition, but a spiral rise, which is development. Confucius once said to Zigong: "If you are always tense and never relax, even King Wen and King Wu cannot do it; if you are always relaxed and never tense, King Wen and King Wu will not do it. A balance between tension and relaxation is the way of King Wen and King Wu." According to Confucius, it is not good to be always tense and never rest, or to be always tired and never tense. If we do not pay attention to adjusting the rhythm of tension and relaxation in the command and leadership of production labor, we will make great mistakes and cause undue losses. Conversely, as long as we pay attention to this issue and fully and correctly exert the production enthusiasm of the masses, we will create great miracles.
    Now, the tense spring season has arrived, the summer of productive harvest is coming, and the annual plan and the long-term plan have been largely finalized. The specific measures to realize this plan have been more urgently put on the agenda. In the magnificent torrent of the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of people have displayed revolutionary vigor and created many new methods of leap forward, with rich experience. At this time, leaders at all levels and in all departments should pay close attention to adjusting the rhythm of production labor, sum up the existing experience, and make the high tide of the national people's Great Leap Forward advance to a higher level.

### 要注意调节生产的节奏

    要注意调节生产的节奏
    一切工作都要有节奏地进行。工业生产也要有节奏。在大跃进中，群众干劲十足，形势发展很快，调节生产的节奏就成了十分重要的问题。
    谈到生产节奏，并不是所有人的理解都一致的。譬如说，有的人认为要苦战三年，就该不惜打破一切正常的和正确的生产秩序。这种理解对不对呢？显然，苦战的本身不是我们追求的目的，通过苦战而要达到的目的是要建设社会主义。为了达到这个目的，我们就要好好地讲究一下苦战的方法。方法对头，节奏就合拍，方法不对，节奏就混乱。
    什么是正确的方法，什么是不正确的方法呢？苦战的方法大体可分为两种：一种是单纯地依靠提高劳动强度，延长工作时间。这就是拼体力、拖时间的苦干方法。这个方法，为了突击某一项紧急任务，偶然采用一下也未可厚非，但总不是我们所提倡的方法。另一种是改进生产管理和劳动组织等方法，改造生产工具，提高生产技术。这就是有智慧、有创造性的苦干方法。这是我们要大力提倡的方法。现在，有意识地引导群众进行创造性的劳动而实现跃进规划的做法，已经在一部分领导人员的思想上引起了重视，然而，对于怎样防止那种单纯地加强劳动强度的现象，还没有引起足够的注意。有些人似乎以为不加班加点，不提高劳动强度，就不能跃进。事实上这种看法是不符合客观实际的。为了加速我们社会主义的建设，群众热情高涨，自发地延长工时、突击生产，是可以理解的；领导人员，乘着群众热情高涨的形势，站在群众的前面带领群众苦干突击，也是完全必要的。但是，领导者的责任却必须进一步想出各种有效的办法，来调节生产劳动的节奏。
    生产劳动从来都是有节奏的。一天当中，人的精力总是有一定限度的。睡了要起来，工作累了还要睡。谁也不能做到起床以后永不睡觉，同样谁也不愿长久睡在床上永不起来。适当的睡眠和休息是获得高度劳动生产率的保证。如果不断突击，最终是会降低劳动生产率的。
    也许有人会问：难道就不要打破常规了吗？我们说，常规已经打破了。按照常规，冬季是农闲的季节，打破了常规，冬闲的季节就变成冬忙的季节了。如果没有冬忙，我们怎样能够兴修那么多的水利呢？但是，打破常规并不是否认事物发展的规律性，不是连生产的节奏也否定了。在多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游的方向上，波浪式前进，有缓有急，有劳有逸，这是生产劳动的自然节奏。缓与急、劳与逸是对立的统一。如果不分缓急和劳逸，只是一鼓劲地提高劳动强度，只有急和劳，而没有缓和逸，那是违背客观规律的。打仗也有它的节奏。有经验的统帅在指挥战争的时候，总是善于利用两个战役之间的空隙进行休整，作战和休整这也是矛盾的统一。甚至于在一个大的战役当中，每一个战斗和战斗之间也要争取时间进行休整。休整不是目的，休整的目的是为了投入另一个战役和另一个战斗，以便取得更大的胜利。急和缓、劳和逸、睡眠和工作、苦战和休整，又都是相互转化的。急转化为缓，缓又转化为急；劳转化为逸，逸又转化为劳；作战转化为休整，休整又转化为作战；如此等等，道理都相同，可以举一而又反十。
    否定事物波浪式前进，认为生产劳动可以不要节奏，这是片面的主观主义的思想，也就是形而上学的观点。在形而上学看来，一切事物是“动者恒动，静者恒静”的，这就是说，动和静都是绝对的。我们的观点与形而上学相反，我们认为一切事物都是不断运动、不断变化、不断发展的，这种运动的过程，不是简单的重复，而是螺旋式的上升，这就是发展。孔子对子贡曾经说过这样一段话：“张而不弛，文武弗能也，弛而弗张，文武弗为也，一张一弛，文武之道也”。按孔子的说法，老是紧张而不休息，或者老是疲沓而不紧张，都是不行的。我们对于生产劳动的指挥和领导，如果不知道注意调节一张一弛的节奏，将会发生很大的毛病，造成不应有的损失。反过来，只要我们注意了这个问题，充分地正确地发挥群众的生产热情，就会创造出伟大的奇迹。
    现在，紧张的春季已经来临，生产丰收的夏季就要到来了，年度规划和远景规划也已经大体地订下来了，实现这个规划的具体措施更加迫切地提到议事日程上来。广大群众在轰轰烈烈的大跃进洪流里，发挥了革命的干劲，创造了许多新的跃进方法，有丰富的经验。这个时候，各地区、各部门的领导人员应该密切地注意调节生产劳动的节奏，总结一下已有的经验，使全国人民大跃进的高潮向着更高的水平突进。
