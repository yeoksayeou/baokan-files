    Remains of Red Rock Uprising Martyrs Reburied in Newly Built Martyrs' Cemetery

    (Xinhua News Agency) The remains of fifty-nine revolutionary martyrs who were murdered by Kuomintang secret agents during the "Red Rock Uprising" were reburied in the newly built Martyrs' Cemetery on Qingming Festival (April 5th) this year. The newly built Martyrs' Cemetery is located on Tiger Mountain, southeast of Chishi in Chong'an County, where the martyrs were martyred.

    The Red Rock Uprising took place on June 17, 1942. At that time, New Fourth Army soldiers who had been imprisoned in the Shangrao Concentration Camp by the Kuomintang reactionaries were escorted from the Shangrao Concentration Camp to Chishi, Chong'an County, Fujian Province, under the surveillance of secret agents and military police. Nearly a hundred comrades in the "Sixth Detachment" took advantage of the opportunity to cross the Chishi River and launched the famous Red Rock Uprising. Some of the comrades broke through the layers of blockades set up by Kuomintang secret agents and military police and escaped. Afterwards, Kuomintang secret agents carried out a cruel massacre of the remaining revolutionary comrades. On June 20th, fifty-two male comrades and seven female comrades were collectively shot and killed by Kuomintang secret agents in the Tiger Mountain trenches eight miles southeast of Chishi. To this day, the images of these communists' unwavering steadfastness before their execution still vividly live in the hearts of the local people. In order to forever commemorate these revolutionary martyrs, the local Party and government leading organs have specially allocated funds to build a magnificent Martyrs' Cemetery at the place where the martyrs were martyred and reburied the martyrs' remains in the cemetery.

    赤石起义烈士遗骸移葬新建烈士陵园
    据新华社讯　在“赤石起义”中被国民党特务杀害的五十九位革命烈士的遗骸，已在今年清明节（4月5日）移葬在新建的烈士陵园里。新建的烈士陵园座落在烈士们当年就义的崇安县赤石东南的虎山上。
    赤石起义发生在1942年6月17日。当时，原来被国民党反动派囚禁在上饶集中营里的新四军志士，在特务、宪兵的枪口监视下，从上饶集中营押解到福建省崇安县赤石地方，“第六队”的近百个同志利用横渡赤石河的机会，举行了有名的赤石起义。其中部分同志冲破国民党特务、宪兵的层层封锁，逃了出去。事后，国民党特务就对留下的革命同志进行了残酷的屠杀。6月20日在有五十二个男同志和七个女同志被国民党特务集体枪杀在赤石东南八里的虎山壕沟中。至今，这些共产党人在临刑前的坚贞不屈的形象，仍然栩栩如生地活在当地人民的心中。为了永远纪念这些革命烈士，当地党政领导机关特地拨出专款，在烈士当年就义的地方修建了一座宏伟的烈士陵园，把烈士遗骸移葬在陵园里。
