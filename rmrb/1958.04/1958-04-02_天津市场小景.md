In the great leap forward, the employees of Tianjin's commerce and service industries are developing a good business style of always thinking of customers, and many moving new scenes are emerging.

Night Store

The employees of the Nanhuali Vegetable and Grocery Retail Store in Tianjin, which has been rated as a city-level model group for four consecutive years, recently broke the old practice of dividing and guarding, and implemented a method of mutual cooperation and one-shift sales, which is welcomed by the residents.

Dumpling Processing Station

Tianjin Catering Company recently set up the first dumpling wrapping service station for customers in Hongxiang Store. Customers only need to send the flour to this processing station to get the wrapped dumplings back. One jin of flour can make seventy-two dumplings. This station has two kinds of fillings: pork and cabbage, and seafood, for customers to choose from. The processing fee is four cents per jin of flour, pork and cabbage filling is seven cents for every ten dumplings, and seafood filling is one dime and three cents for every ten dumplings. Master Yao Hongxing, a master with thirty years of working experience at this processing station, makes delicious and palatable dumplings, which are very popular among residents. Some cadres said: "It's so convenient to send the flour here and eat dumplings after get off work."

Free Repair of Faucets

In the leap forward, the meter readers and water meter replacement workers of Tianjin Water Company automatically expanded the scope of their work. In addition to their own work, they also repair faucets and replace washers for citizens free of charge. Since February, they have repaired problems on water pipes for more than 300 households. Liu Yongyuan, a meter replacement worker, went to Fushanli to replace a water meter. An old lady nearby came to him with a newly bought faucet. Liu Yongyuan immediately went to replace it for him. The old lady said happily: "It's so convenient to have you in charge now."

Mobile Pharmacy

Residents living in remote areas of Tianjin City have to go to the city center to buy medicine because there is no pharmacy there, which is very inconvenient. Recently, the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Company Retail Store organized a mobile pharmacy car, loaded with more than 200 kinds of commonly used medicines such as aspirin, infant amine, and pain relievers, and went to remote areas such as Zhongshanmenwai and Zhengzhuangzi every day to sell medicines, which was warmly welcomed by the local residents.

Substitute Search for Urgently Needed Equipment

The factory and mine contact group of Tianjin Electric Equipment Store recently established a "Customer Service Station", specializing in finding urgently needed electrical equipment and key equipment for factories, enterprises, and handicraft production cooperatives. Daguhua Chemical Plant's oxygen workshop urgently needed more than ten kilograms of red paper for electrical insulation. The salesmen of this group traveled for two days and found the red paper from other factories, solving the maintenance problem of the oxygen workshop.

No Worry about Car Breakdown

Tianjin Automobile Repair Factory has established an emergency repair team. If a car breaks down on the way, as long as you call them, they will rush to the scene to repair the car. On March 21, they rushed to the venue of the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress and repaired two cars. The drivers said happily: "Your spirit of service is too good, it has helped us solve a big problem."

Cut Five Pieces of Clothing from Four

In the clothing department of Qianxiangyi Chenji Cotton Cloth Store, there are many semi-finished woolen pants and vests hanging, and customers can choose and try them on to see if they fit, and then process them into finished products. These pants and vests are cheaper than customized ones by more than three to seven yuan each. It is made by adopting the "four-piece suit cutting" method created by Tong Jinfal, a worker at the Shanghai Clothing Factory. When cutting four pants or vests of the same size, using the nesting method, one more pair of pants or one vest can be cut out.

Cutting on Behalf of Customers

"The key to the style of clothes lies in tailoring." Some housewives who can't tailor are often troubled by this. Now this problem is solved. Tianjin Peace Road Department Store and Women and Children's Products Store have recently added a "Customer Cutting Counter", where skilled tailoring workers cut for customers. After customers buy printed cloth and wool, they can ask the tailoring workers to cut out all kinds of fitting children's clothing, casual wear, vests... The handling fee is only 10% of the clothing processing fee.

    天津市场小景
    天津市商业和服务业的职工们，在大跃进声中，一种处处为顾客着想的良好经营作风正在形成，出现了许多动人的新气象。夜商店
    连续四年被评为市级模范小组的天津市南华里蔬菜杂货零售店职工，最近打破过去分兵把守的陈规，实行互相协作，一班到底的售货方法，受到居民的欢迎。

      饺子加工站
    天津市饮食公司最近在宏祥门市部设立了第一个给顾客包饺子
  的加工服务站。顾客只要把面粉送到这个加工站，就可以取回包好的饺子，一斤面包七十二个饺子。这个站备有猪肉白菜、三鲜两种馅，随顾客挑选。每斤面加工费四分，猪肉
  白菜馅每十个七分钱，三鲜馅十个一角三分钱。这个加工站的姚洪兴老师傅有三十年的工作经验，做出来的饺子味美适口，很受居民的欢迎。有的干部说：“把面送来，下班以后就能吃上饺子，太方便了。
    免费修理水龙头
    天津市自来水公司的验表员和修换水表的工人们，在跃进声中自动扩大工作范围。他们除本职工作外，还免费为市民修理自来水龙头、换皮钱等。2月份以来，已为三百多户居民修理好水管上的毛病。换表工人刘永元，在福善里换水表时，附近的一位老大娘拿着新买的水龙头来找他，刘永元立即就去给他换上了。老大娘高兴地说：现在有你们管，可真方便多了。
      流动售药车
    居住在天津市边远地区的居民们，因为当地没有药房，要买药就得跑到市中心来，很不方便。最近，天津市医药公司零售商店组织了一辆流动售药车，装载着阿司匹林、婴儿胺、止痛片等二百多种常用成药，每天到中山门外、郑庄子等边远地区去卖药，受到当地居民的热烈欢迎。
    代寻急需器材
    天津市电工器材商店的厂矿联系小组，最近建立了一个“顾客服务站”，专门为各工厂、企业、手工业生产合作社寻找急需的电工器材和关键器材。大沽化工厂检修氧气车间急需隔电用的红番纸十多公斤，这个小组的业务员奔走了两天，从别的工厂里找到了红番纸，解决了氧气车间的检修问题。汽车抛锚不用愁
    天津市汽车修理厂成立了急修组，汽车如在中途发生故障，只要打电话给他们，他们就立即赶往现场把车修好。3月21日，他们赶到市人民代表大会开会场所，修好了两辆汽车。司机们高兴地说：你们这种服务精神太好了，帮助我们解决了很大问题。四件衣料裁五件
    谦祥益辰记棉布店的服装部里，挂着很多毛料裤子和马甲的半成品，顾客挑选试穿合适后，再加工成成品。这种裤子和马甲要比定制的每件便宜三元多到七元多钱。它是采用上海服装工厂工人佟金发创造的“四件套裁”法作的。凡是剪裁四件同一尺寸的裤子或马甲时，用套裁的方法，就可多裁出一条裤子或一件马甲来。代客剪裁
    “衣服的式样好坏，关键在于剪裁”。一些不会剪裁的家庭妇女，常常为此苦恼。现在这个问题解决了。天津市和平路百货商店和妇女儿童用品商店，在最近增设了“代客剪裁柜”，由技术高明的剪裁工人替顾客剪裁。顾客买了花布，呢绒后，就可请剪裁工人裁出合身的各种各样的童装，便装，马甲……。手续费只有服装加工费的10％。
