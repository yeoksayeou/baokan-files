    Exchanging Leather Shoes from Four Thousand Li Away
    In late March, I went to Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, for a meeting. On my way back, I bought a pair of leather shoes with a good style and a low price for my wife at the Tianxiang Women's Shoe Store in Beijing. Who knew that after returning to Hailar City, the shoes were too small for my wife. This made me feel troubled. If I sold them, I would feel reluctant; if I didn't sell them, she couldn't wear them. Finally, I thought of a solution: write a letter to the shoe store to ask if they could be exchanged. Eight days after the letter was sent, a reply came back, and I was extremely happy when I opened it. The letter not only said they would exchange them, but also told me to send the shoes in a wooden box to avoid damage, and informed me that Tianxiang Women's Shoe Store had changed its name to Buyunzhai due to adjustments in the commercial network. After I sent the shoes, the exchanged shoes fit my wife perfectly. Our whole family was moved by the shoe store's enthusiastic spirit of serving customers four thousand li away, and we are writing this article to express our gratitude. Bao Gang

    四千里外换皮鞋
    3月下旬，我去内蒙古呼和浩特开会，归途中在北京天祥妇女鞋店给我爱人买了一双样式好、价格便宜的皮鞋。谁知回到海拉尔市后，我爱人一穿太小，这可叫我为了难，卖了吧，舍不得，不卖吧，穿不得。最后想了一个办法，给鞋店去封信问问能不能调换。信寄出八天后，果然回来信，我拆开一看，高兴极了。信中不仅说给换，还告诉用木箱将鞋寄去，以免压坏，并告知天祥妇女鞋店因调整商业网改名步沄斋。我把鞋寄去后，换回来的鞋我爱人穿上整合脚。我们全家都被这家鞋店热情为四千里以外的顾客服务的精神所感动，特写此文表示感谢。　宝刚
