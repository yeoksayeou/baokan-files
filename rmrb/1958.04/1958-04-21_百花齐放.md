    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
        18 Jasmine
        Our flowers are small and delicate, snowy white and fragrant. When placed in the hair of young women, their fragrance fills the room. Of course, people can also pick us to be roasted into scented tea leaves, and chefs can use us to garnish bamboo ginseng soup. Yet some dirty intellectuals call us "lewd objects" (note), which shows how absurd their minds are. If such thoughts are not thoroughly reformed, and they don't plan to pass the test of socialist revolution, they should forget about it!
    (Note) "Cai Fang Sui Bi" (Notes while picking fragrance) considers jasmine a "lewd object." It pretty much assigns this kind of character to other flowers as well.
        19 Mirabilis jalapa
        Our other name is胭脂花, Rouge Flower. We bloom all over, and our shapes are like small trumpets. Children pick our flower tubes, pull out the stamens, and hold them to their lips to blow, making a crisp, hoarse sound. The flower juice can be used as lip rouge, and the black seeds contain white powder, which is especially welcomed by country girls. Like us, who are naturally made cosmetics, using us is in line with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical.
    20 Peach Blossom
        We and plum blossoms are close allies. The flower-filled world is 李白 (Li Bai) plus 桃红 (peach red). We welcome the east wind and hate the west wind. The east wind brings warmth and enables us to produce both flowers and fruit. What's this about the Queen Mother's peaches of immortality? What a joke! They take three thousand years to bear fruit and three thousand years to bloom! We are promoters, not obstructors. That slow and small output is wasteful and poor.
    21 Plum Blossom
        Yes, we plum blossoms are also promoters. Our flowering and fruiting are plentiful and fast. As long as the warm east wind blows from beyond the horizon, we will turn the whole mountain into a sea of snow. The poet Li Bai was a brilliant genius. His surname and given name have some connection with us. He was a prolific writer, writing a hundred poems after drinking a斗 of wine. We must also bear abundant fruit and compete with him.
    22 Apricot Blossom
        Whether single-petaled or double-petaled, we have one problem: we gradually fade from red to white. Although our trunks are tall, our roots are not very deep. We need large stones to weigh down our roots so that our flowers and fruits can flourish. The good thing about single-petaled apricot blossoms is that we still have fruit and apricot kernels. The fruit turns from green to yellow, with a touch of red in the yellow. Double-petaled apricot blossoms only have flowers that turn from red to white. We request botanists to transform us.

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
        18　茉莉花我们的花朵小巧，雪白而有清香，插在姑娘们的头上会芬芳满堂。当然，人们也可以摘去焙成香片，厨师们更可以用来点缀竹参汤。有那肮脏的文人却称我们是“狎品”，（注）足见他们的头脑是荒天下之大唐。这样的思想如果不加以彻底改造，打算过社会主义革命关，休要妄想！
    （注）　“采芳随笔”以茉莉为“狎品”。其他各花也大抵这样定了品格。
        19　紫茉莉我们的别名又叫做胭脂花，花开满头，形状都像些小喇叭。小孩们摘去花管，把蕊丝都拔下，含在唇间吹弄，其声清脆而呜哑。花汁可以点唇，黑子中包含白粉，乡下姑娘们也特别表示欢迎。像我们这样天生成的化妆品，采用了我们就合乎多快好省。
    20　桃花我们和李花是亲密的联盟，花花世界是李白加上桃红。我们欢迎东风而讨厌西风，东风送暖使我们花实并茂。哪有什么王母蟠桃，真是笑话，要三千年结实，三千年开花！我们是促进派，不是促退派，那样少而慢，也就是费和差。
    21　李花是，我们李花也一样是促进派，我们开花结果都是多而且快。只要和暖的东风从天外吹来，我们会使满山遍野变成雪海。诗人李白是一位出色的天才，他的姓和名同我们有些联带。他是位多产作家，斗酒诗百篇，我们也要多结果实，和他比赛。
    22　杏花不管是单瓣或复瓣有一个毛病，便是先红后白逐渐把红色褪尽。树杆虽然高大，植根却不很深，要用大石压根，花实才能繁盛。单瓣的好在还有果实，还有杏仁，果实由青而黄，黄中还带有红韵。复瓣的就只有先红而后白的花，请求植物学家把我们改造一下。（附图片）
