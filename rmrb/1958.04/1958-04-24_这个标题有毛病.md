    This Title Has Problems
    On April 3rd, the People's Daily published an article on its seventh page written by a group, "'Esteeming the Past and Belittling the Present' at the Normal University". This article exposed how some literature teachers, starting from bourgeois ideology, esteemed the past and belittled the present, and distorted classical literature in their teaching, causing adverse effects. This was beneficial. However, this article used an incorrect lead-in title:
  “Where Does Classical Literature Lead Us?” as if classical literature itself was at fault. It should be changed to "Where Does Classical Literature Teaching Lead Us?" to be consistent with the content of the article.

    这个标题有毛病
    4月3日人民日报第七版登了一群所写的“‘厚古薄今’在师大”一文。这篇文章揭露了有些文学教师从资产阶级思想出发，厚古薄今，并在教学中歪曲了古典文学因而造成的恶劣影响，是有益的。但是，这篇文章却用了一个错误的引题：
  “古典文学把我们引到哪里去？”好像古典文学本身有什么过错。应当改为“古典文学教学把我们引到哪里去？”，才与文章的内容符合。
