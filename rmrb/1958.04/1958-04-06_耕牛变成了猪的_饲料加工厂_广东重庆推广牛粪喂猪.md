Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd: In Heshan County, Guangdong Province, the practice of using cow dung to replace a portion of refined feed for pigs has recently been widely promoted. For over a month, various locations in the county have been using cow dung as the primary feed for pigs, and the general feedback is that the pigs have strong appetites, rosy complexions, and are developing well, growing meat faster than pigs fed with refined feed.

The current method for feeding pigs with cow dung in various regions involves mixing it with a small amount of bran, green fodder, and raw salt. The general ratio is: 100 catties of cow dung, 20 catties of bran, 40 catties of green fodder, and 5 liang of raw salt. When first used, the amount of cow dung can be smaller, gradually increasing later. The feeding method involves first boiling the cow dung to evaporate the fishy odor, while discarding sand, mud, impurities, and foam that floats to the surface, then adding other feeds to cook together. This can disinfect and sterilize, preventing infectious diseases.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd: Guangdong Province is promoting Heshan County's experience in feeding pigs with cow dung throughout the province.

To find the exact scientific basis for feeding pigs with cow dung, the Provincial Department of Agriculture, South China Agricultural College, and South China Agricultural Science Research Institute sent a working group composed of livestock professors, technicians, and technical staff to Heshan County for on-site observation and systematic investigation and research.

According to analysis, cow dung contains carotene, Vitamin B, various enzymes, and trace elements. Its nutritional value lies mainly in the supplementation of vitamins, which can enhance the appetite of pigs and stimulate their growth, especially promoting the growth and development of piglets. Pigs fed with cow dung and rice bran show particularly shiny and smooth skin. Cow dung contains sticky secretions from the cow's intestines and stomach, which can aid digestion, normalize the pigs' bowel movements, and prevent constipation. A serious threat to pig farming is piglet diarrhea. Since Heshan County promoted feeding pigs with cow dung, the incidence of piglet diarrhea has been rare; whether cow dung can avoid this symptom remains to be studied and confirmed.

Feeding pigs with cow dung can also save a large amount of bran and reduce costs. After using cow dung, Heshan County reduced the amount of bran used by half to two-thirds compared to the original amount. According to analysis, cow dung cannot completely replace refined feed (protein). If cow dung is used as green and coarse feed, it will have a greater effect when used in conjunction with appropriate amounts of green feed and refined feed.

After Heshan County widely promoted feeding pigs with cow dung, fundamental changes occurred in pig farming and cattle raising. In the past, the masses always emphasized the lack of feed when raising more pigs, and had many concerns. Now, the pig raising plans of various agricultural cooperatives have automatically increased several times to more than ten times. Now that oxen are seen by the masses as "feed processing plants" and "pig feed bases," the long-standing tendency to squeeze out cows, calves, weak cattle, and to focus only on draught power while neglecting breeding and other long-term interests has immediately been reversed. A new phenomenon of cherishing oxen and emphasizing breeding and mating has generally emerged, and unreasonable staff allocation in feeding has also been appropriately corrected.

This newspaper reports: The Chongqing Jingkou Farm and Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative have successfully experimented with feeding pigs with cow dung. Pigs fed with cow dung gain weight faster than pigs fed with ordinary feed.

The Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, based on the method of farmers in Xinfan County using cow dung to replace bran to feed pigs, conducted experiments in places such as Jingkou Farm and Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative. They fermented fresh cow dung with 2% soda for about four to eight hours, then mixed it into cooked green fodder. Initially, two catties of cow dung were added to every ten catties of green fodder, and later the cow dung can be gradually increased to five catties. If it is dry cow dung, it should be crushed into small pieces, soaked in 2% warm soda water for one hour, and then add some salt and mixed into the cooked green fodder.

Jingkou Farm used a litter of five pigs as an experiment. Three pigs were fed with fresh dairy cow dung, and the average weight gain per pig per day was one catty, twelve liang, and six qian; the two pigs that were not fed cow dung had an average weight gain per pig per day of fifteen liang and three qian.

According to the experiments of Jingkou Farm and Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative, dairy cow dung, buffalo dung, yellow cattle dung, and dried cow dung can all be used to feed pigs, but fresh cow dung fermented is the best for feeding pigs. Large pigs and small pigs can be fed with cow dung, but the larger the pig, the faster the weight gain, and the smaller the pig, the slower the weight gain. The method of feeding pigs with cow dung will be gradually promoted in Chongqing. (Zhou Piaoping)

    耕牛变成了猪的“饲料加工厂”
    广东重庆推广牛粪喂猪
    据新华社广州3日电　广东省鹤山县最近普遍推广采用牛粪代替一部分精饲料喂猪。这个县各地采用牛粪作主要饲料养猪已近一个多月，普遍反映猪的食欲旺盛，猪身红润，发育良好，比用精饲料喂的猪，长肉比较快些。
    目前各地用牛粪作饲料喂猪的办法是：配合少量糠、青饲料和生盐。一般的比例：牛粪一百斤，糠二十斤，青饲料四十斤，生盐五两。最初使用时牛粪可以少些，然后逐渐增加。喂养方法是先将牛粪煮沸，蒸发去腥臭气味，同时弃掉沙泥杂质和面上浮起的泡沫，然后放上其他饲料一齐煮。这样可以消毒杀菌，防止传染病。
    据新华社广州3日电　广东省正在全省范围内推广鹤山县用牛粪喂猪的经验。
    为了找到牛粪喂猪的确切科学根据，这个省农业厅、华南农学院和华南农业科学研究所曾派出畜牧教授、技师、技术员等多人组成工作组，在鹤山县进行了实地观察和系统的调查研究。
    根据分析，牛粪内含有胡萝卜素、维生素乙、各种酵素和微量元素等，它的营养价值主要在于维生素的补充，能增进猪的食欲，刺激猪的生长，特别是促进小猪的生长发育。用牛粪和统糠喂养的猪，皮色特别显得光泽润滑。牛粪内含有带有粘性的牛的肠胃的分泌物，能帮助消化，使猪大便正常，不发生便秘。养猪业的严重威胁是小猪下痢，鹤山县推广牛粪喂猪后很少发生小猪下痢现象；是否牛粪能避免这种症状，尚待研究证实。
    用牛粪喂猪还能大量节约用糠量，降低成本。鹤山县使用牛粪后，用糠量比原来用量减少了一半到三分之二。据分析，牛粪还不能完全代替精饲料（蛋白质），如将牛粪当青粗饲料使用，与适量的青饲料、精饲料配合使用，作用更大。
    鹤山县普遍推广牛粪喂猪以后，养猪和养牛业发生了根本变化。过去群众对多养猪总强调缺乏饲料，顾虑很多。现在各农业社养猪计划自动增加几倍到十几倍。现在，耕牛被群众看成是“饲料加工厂”、“猪的饲料基地”后，长期排挤母牛、小牛、弱牛和只图使役忽视繁殖等不顾长远利益的倾向，立即扭转过来，普遍出现了爱护耕牛、重视繁殖配种的新现象，饲养员工分不合理的也得到适当修正。
    本报讯　重庆市井口农场和金星农业社试验用牛粪喂猪获得成功。用牛粪喂的猪比用一般饲料喂的猪还长肉快。
    重庆市农林水利局根据新繁县农民用牛粪代替糠麸喂猪的方法，在井口农场和金星农业社等处进行实验。他们将新鲜牛粪用2％的苏打发酵约四一八小时后，掺在煮好的青饲料内。开始时每十斤青饲料加牛粪两斤，以后可逐步将牛粪增至五斤。如果是干牛粪，就打成碎末后用2％的温热苏打水浸泡一小时，再加点食盐掺在煮好的青饲料内。
    井口农场用一窝生的五头猪作试验，三头用新鲜奶牛粪喂，平均每头每日增重一斤十二两六钱；不喂牛粪的两头猪，平均每头每日增重十五两三钱。
    据井口农场和金星农业社的试验，奶牛粪，水牛粪，黄牛粪，已经干了的牛粪，都可以喂猪，但以新鲜牛粪发酵后喂猪最好。大猪小猪都可以喂牛粪，但猪越大增重越快，猪小增重较慢。用牛粪喂猪的办法将在重庆市逐步推广。　　（周漂萍）
