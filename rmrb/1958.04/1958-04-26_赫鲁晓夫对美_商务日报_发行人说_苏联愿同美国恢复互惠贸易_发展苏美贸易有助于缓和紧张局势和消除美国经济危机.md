Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 25th: Khrushchev told Mr. Liddell, owner and publisher of the American "Business Daily," and editor Ludick that ideological differences should not, in any case, be an obstacle to the development of mutually beneficial trade between socialist and capitalist countries. The full text of this conversation was published in the latest issue of the Soviet magazine "International Life."

Khrushchev said that foreign trade is the foundation on which the coexistence of countries with different social and economic systems can develop smoothly and be continuously strengthened.

He pointed out that in 1957, the Soviet Union's trade volume with capitalist countries increased by about double compared to 1938. He expressed the Soviet Union's willingness to further expand trade. Khrushchev expressed regret that the Soviet-American trade agreement signed in 1937 did not receive due development after World War II because the U.S. government adopted a series of restrictive measures and abolished the agreement in 1951.

Khrushchev recalled that there used to be good relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. He said, we are willing to restore this good relationship. Now, the United States is the only major power without a trade agreement relationship with the Soviet Union and one of the few such countries in the world.

Khrushchev said, we believe that the smooth development of Soviet-American trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit not only meets the interests of the Soviet and American people and can strengthen trust between the Soviet Union and the United States, but also helps to further ease international tensions.

Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet Union is willing to sell manganese ore, fur, and goods traditionally traded between the two countries to the United States, and is prepared to consider selling iron ore. He said that the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are capable of purchasing large quantities of American-made goods, so that the current recession suffered by American industry may be eliminated on a healthy basis.

Khrushchev gave an affirmative answer to Liddell's question about the Soviet Union's attitude toward developing multilateral trade relations. In answering another question, he said that economic relations between countries must be developed, mainly through the exchange of goods. He said that dumping policies are not a healthy basis for trade.

Khrushchev also said that West Germany and Japan have now become competitors to the United States in the world market, while there are no conflicting areas in the Soviet Union's economic relations with the United States.

Khrushchev said that many capitalist countries now have extensive trade relations with the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviet Union's foreign trade volume exceeded eight billion U.S. dollars at world prices, an increase of 13% compared to 1956. In 1956, the Soviet Union had jumped to sixth place in the world in terms of foreign trade volume.

Khrushchev condemned some of the existing restrictions in trade between capitalist and socialist countries. He said, we advocate the abolition of all trade restrictions and prohibitions. He also expressed the hope that more American business people would visit the Soviet Union, and that Soviet industrial workers would also visit the United States. Khrushchev said that this would benefit both the Soviet and American people.

    赫鲁晓夫对美“商务日报”发行人说
    苏联愿同美国恢复互惠贸易
    发展苏美贸易有助于缓和紧张局势和消除美国经济危机
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：赫鲁晓夫对美国“商务日报”所有人兼发行人李德尔和编辑卢迪克说，意识形态上的分歧无论如何不能成为社会主义国家和资本主义国家发展互惠贸易的障碍。这次谈话的全文发表在最近一期的苏联“国际生活”杂志上。
    赫鲁晓夫说，对外贸易是不同社会制度和经济制度的国家的共处赖以顺利发展和不断加强的基础。
    他指出，1957年苏联同资本主义国家的贸易额比1938年约增长了一倍。他表示苏联愿意进一步扩大贸易。赫鲁晓夫表示遗憾说，1937年签订的苏美贸易协定在第二次世界大战后没有得到应有的发展，因为美国政府采取了一系列的限制措施，而在1951年废除了这一协定。
    赫鲁晓夫追述说，当年美苏之间曾有过良好的关系。他说，我们愿意恢复这种良好的关系。现在，美国是同苏联没有贸易协定关系的唯一大国和世界上为数不多的这类国家之一。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，在平等互惠的基础上，顺利发展苏美贸易不仅符合苏美两国人民的利益，可以加强苏美之间的信任，同时也有助于达到进一步缓和国际紧张局势的目的。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联愿意向美国出售锰矿、毛皮和两国之间传统贸易的商品，并且准备考虑出售铁矿砂的问题。他说，苏联和其他社会主义国家是能够大量购买美国制造的商品的，这样一来，美国工业目前所遭到的衰退就可能在健康的基础上消除。
    赫鲁晓夫对李德尔就苏联对发展多边贸易关系的态度而提出的问题作了肯定的答复。他在回答另外一个问题时说，必须发展各国之间的经济关系，主要是交换商品。他说，倾销政策不是贸易的健康基础。
    赫鲁晓夫还说，现在，西德和日本已经成了世界市场上美国的竞争者，而在苏联同美国的经济关系中，没有冲突的地方。
    赫鲁晓夫说，许多资本主义国家现在都同苏联有着大量的贸易往来。1957年，苏联对外贸易额按世界价格计算超过八十亿美元，比1956年增长了13％。在1956年，就对外贸易额来说，苏联已跃居世界第六位。
    赫鲁晓夫谴责在资本主义国家同社会主义国家的贸易中现存的一些限制。他说，我们主张取消贸易上的一切限制和禁令。他还表示希望有更多的美国工商界人士到苏联来访问，而苏联的工业工作人员也去美国访问。赫鲁晓夫说，这对苏美两国人民都会有益处。
