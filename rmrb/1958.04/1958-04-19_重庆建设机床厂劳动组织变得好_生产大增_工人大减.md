Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, April 18th: The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, in adjusting its labor organization, changed the original situation of overly detailed, singular, and fixed division of labor. It actively organized workers to manage multiple machine tools and multiple production processes, significantly increasing labor productivity and promoting the comprehensive development and improvement of workers' technical skills. When formulating this year's production plan, the factory initially proposed adding more than 1,800 workers. After adjusting the labor organization and carrying out technological innovation, the current annual production leap forward plan has increased nearly twofold compared to the original. Not only has the factory not increased workers, but it has also transferred more than 500 skilled workers and more than 200 temporary workers to support new factories and agricultural construction.

This factory has a wide variety of machine tool types, jobs, and processes, with more than 100 job types and tens of thousands of processes. In the past, the labor organization in the production workshops was too detailed, singular, and fixed. Generally, one worker would oversee one machine tool and perform one or two processes. This division of labor brought the following problems to production: on the one hand, it required a large number of workers and machines, and the workshops often complained of insufficient labor and equipment; on the other hand, workers on many machine tools were idle, and equipment utilization was very low. This situation became even more prominent with the development of the technological innovation movement throughout the factory.

In order to change this situation, the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory began to rectify the labor organization in the production workshops in February. The first step was to organize workers to promote multiple machine tool management on machine tools with longer operating times, gradually changing from one person overseeing one machine tool to overseeing multiple machine tools. The leadership first conducted "experimental fields" in the work section where labor model Liao Shigang was located, supporting and helping Liao Shigang implement multi-tool multi-edge and multi-clamp tools on machine tools, and rationally utilizing time to operate five machine tools. After the experiment was successful, the factory Party committee promptly organized on-site visits and demonstrations, mobilizing the masses to vigorously promote multiple machine tool management. According to incomplete statistics, more than 300 machine tools have now implemented multiple machine tool management, saving more than 200 technicians who originally oversaw the machine tools.

Another important measure taken by this factory to adjust the labor organization in the workshops is to promote the concurrent management of processes, that is, to gradually change from one person only overseeing one or two processes to concurrently managing multiple processes. Various workshops are currently universally organizing and promoting this. Some workshops currently have 70% of their workers implementing concurrent management of multiple processes, with the most concurrently managing twelve processes. This has also greatly saved production workers.

The Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, in vigorously promoting multiple machine tool management and concurrent management of processes, not only saved a large number of production workers to open more production shifts, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor in completing larger tasks, but also significantly improved labor productivity and equipment utilization. This has increased the factory's labor productivity in the first quarter of this year by more than 28% compared to the plan. Another important gain from implementing multiple machine tool management and concurrent management of processes is that workers have gradually changed from overly singular operations in the past to being able to master a variety of technical operations, greatly promoting the comprehensive development and improvement of workers' technical skills.

While implementing multiple machine tool management and concurrent management of processes in the production workshops, this factory also adjusted the unreasonable labor organization in administrative offices and other aspects of workshops, work sections, and groups. The factory previously had thirty-one departments, which were overly complex and repetitive, and have now been reduced and merged into fifteen. The number of technical staff in the factory has also been reduced from more than 2,000 to more than 1,200, and most of the surplus employees have been transferred to production workshops. After the merger of many workshops, work sections, and groups, not only has the number of management personnel been reduced, but the technical strength has also been greatly increased, and production efficiency has been improved.

    重庆建设机床厂劳动组织变得好
    生产大增　　工人大减
    新华社重庆18日电　重庆建设机床厂在调整劳动组织中，改变原来劳动分工过细、单一和固定的状况，积极组织工人管理多台机床和多道生产工序，显著提高了劳动生产率，并促进了工人技术水平的全面发展和提高。这个厂原来制定今年生产计划时，提出要增加一千八百多工人，在调整劳动组织和开展技术革新后，现在全年生产跃进计划比原来增长将近一倍，不但没有增加工人，还调出了五百多名技术工人和两百多名临时工支援新厂和农业建设。
    这个厂的机床种类和工种、工序都很繁多，有一百多个工种、上万道工序。过去生产车间劳动组织分工过于细密、单一和固定，一般是一个工人看管一台机床，做一两道工序。这样分工给生产带来的问题是：一方面需要配备数量很多的工人和机器，车间还常叫劳动力、设备不足；另一方面，也有不少机床上的工人窝工，设备利用率很低。这种状况随着全厂的技术革新运动开展后，便更加突出了。
    为了改变这种状况，重庆建设机床厂从2月份以来就着手整顿生产车间的劳动组织。首先是在机器开动时间较长的机床上组织工人推广多机床管理，将原来一人看管一台机床逐步改为看管多台机床。领导方面先在劳动模范廖世刚所在的工段搞“试验田”，支持和帮助廖世刚在机床上实行多刀多刃、多夹工具，合理利用时间来操纵五台机床。试验成功后，厂党委及时组织现场参观表演，发动群众大力推广多机床管理。据不完全统计，目前已有三百多部机床实现了多机床管理，节约了二百多名原来看管机床的技工。
    这个厂调整车间劳动组织的另一重要措施，是推广兼管工序，即由原来一人只看一两道工序逐步改为兼管多道工序。各个车间都正在普遍组织推广。有的车间目前已有70％的工人实行了兼管多道工序，最多的已兼管了十二道工序。这样也大大节约了生产工人。
    重庆建设机床厂在大力推行多机床管理和兼管工序中，不但节约出大批生产工人来多开生产班次，解决完成更大的任务中劳动力不足的困难，还显著提高了劳动生产率和设备利用率。使全厂今年一季度的劳动生产率比计划提高了28％以上。实行多机床管理和兼管工序的另一重要收获，是工人们已逐渐由过去过分单一的操作变为能掌握多种技术操作，大大促进了工人技术水平的全面发展和提高。
    在生产车间实行多机床管理和兼管工序同时，这个厂还将行政科室以及车间、工段、小组其他方面不合理的劳动组织进行了调整。全厂的科室过去有三十一个，过分繁杂重复，现已裁减合并为十五个。全厂技职人员也由两千多人紧缩到一千二百多人，多余的职工大都下放到车间生产。不少车间、工段和小组合并后，不但减少了管理人员，还大大增加了技术力量，提高了生产效率。
