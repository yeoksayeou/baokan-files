Great Battle Against Sparrows
	April 19th, Wu Shi, the cocks crowed and people rose, heroic people, rubbing their fists and preparing to fight. Inside and outside the cities and countryside, battle flags fluttered, earth-shattering, gongs and drums sounded. Hundreds of thousands of people, in a great battle. Flocks of sparrows, exhausted their wings. Mountains and plains, covered with nets. Branches and eaves, no hiding allowed. Day and night, without rest, drawing bows and firing guns, exterminate the sparrows, ten thousand piculs return to the granary.

    大战麻雀
    吴视四月十九，鸡叫起床，英雄人民，磨拳擦掌。城乡内外，战旗飘扬，惊天动地，锣鼓敲响。数百万人，大战一场。成群麻雀，累断翅膀。漫山遍野，天罗地网。树桠屋角，不准躲藏。昼夜不休，张弓放枪，麻雀绝种，万石归仓。
