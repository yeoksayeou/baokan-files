Half-Month Agricultural Situation

    "Qingming" (April 5th) "Guyu" (April 20th)
    During this period, summer crops in provinces such as Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Sichuan have matured or are nearing maturity. In most parts of Jiangxi and parts of Sichuan and Yunnan, rapeseed, wheat, and broad beans have begun to be harvested. Summer crops in these areas are generally growing well, presenting a scene of abundant harvest everywhere. Members of the Jiulian Agricultural Cooperative in Hawan Township, Nanfeng County, Jiangxi, pointed to the rapeseed with many pods and full grains, saying that this is the first bumper harvest in over sixty years. According to preliminary estimates in Yunnan, the output of rapeseed and wheat this year may increase by 20% to 30% compared to last year.
    Wheat in some areas of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has already headed, and rapeseed has entered the peak pod-bearing period. Agricultural cooperatives in these areas have already begun preparations for the summer harvest.
    Wheat in various parts of the Huanghuai region is also generally jointing and booting. Lodging has occurred in a few wheat fields in provinces such as Henan and Shandong. While strengthening late-stage field management, these areas have also taken various measures to prevent possible lodging.
                     ＊
    During the "Qingming" and "Guyu" period, most areas in the Yangtze River basin continued to transplant early rice. In some areas of provinces such as Guangxi, early rice was transplanted against drought threats.
    This year, transplanting in these areas is generally about half a month earlier than last year. Old farmers in the Gannan area of Jiangxi compared this year's transplanting period with previous years, saying: In the past, "Qingming" was when seedlings clung to their mothers, but this year, "Qingming" is when seedlings marry their grooms.
    Some areas of Guangdong Province and Fujian Province, which have completed the task of transplanting early rice, began to carry out intensive cultivation, weeding, and topdressing of early rice fields in mid-April.
    In Qiongdong, Lehui, and Wanning counties of Guangdong, early rice has begun to head and flower during this period.
                              ＊
    In these two weeks, agricultural cooperatives in northern regions have been enthusiastically sowing cotton and miscellaneous grains. Hubei and Shandong provinces, as well as Guanzhong, southern Shanxi, western Henan, and northern Henan, have completed or basically completed this year's cotton sowing task before "Guyu." Other cotton-growing areas, except for a few areas with later seasons, also began sowing in mid-April.
    The characteristics of cotton sowing in various places this year are: early sowing period, fast and concentrated sowing, and good sowing quality. In most sown areas, the cotton sowing period this year is about ten days earlier than last year. Some areas only sowed after "Guyu" last year, but this year, all sowing was completed one or two days before "Guyu." More than twenty counties such as Quwo in southern Shanxi finished cotton sowing in five days this year, which is an example of fast and concentrated sowing. Some areas in Hebei and northern Henan are also fighting drought to plant cotton. Cotton sown in areas with severe drought may have difficulty in emerging.
    The sowing of miscellaneous grains in these areas has also begun successively. Some counties that started early have already completed sowing by "Guyu." Seedlings have already emerged in some early-sown areas.
                                ＊
    During this period, there was little rainfall in most parts of the country. In most parts of Xinjiang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia provinces (autonomous regions), and the central part of Northeast China, there was no rain in the ten days of mid-April. In the central and southern parts of Northeast China, most of Inner Mongolia, the northwestern part of North China, the southeastern part of Gansu, and most of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, rainfall in March was already less than in previous years, and rainfall in the first and middle ten days of April was still very low. These areas are experiencing varying degrees of drought. In order not to miss the farming season, cadres and the masses here are concentrating their efforts on fighting drought and rushing to transplant and sow.

专栏：半月农情

    半月农情
    “清明”（4月5日）“谷雨”（4月20日）
    在这个阶段里，江西、云南、四川等省的夏熟作物已经成熟或接近成熟。江西大部地区和四川、云南部分地区的油菜、小麦和蚕豆已开始收割。这些地区的夏熟作物普遍生长良好，到处呈现丰收景象。江西南丰县哈湾乡九连农业社社员指着荚多粒满的油菜说，这是六十多年来的第一次大丰收。据云南初步估计，今年的油菜、小麦可比去年增产二到三成。
    长江中、下游一些地区的小麦已经抽穗，油菜进入结荚盛期。这些地区的农业社有的已开始了夏季收获的准备工作。
    黄淮流域各地的小麦也普遍拔节孕穗。河南、山东等省少数麦田出现倒伏现象。这些地区在加强后期田间管理的同时，还采取了各种措施以防止可能发生的倒伏。
                     ＊
    长江流域多数地区在“清明”“谷雨”间继续进行早稻插秧。广西等省的一些地区的早稻是在干旱的威胁下抗旱抢插的。
    这些地区今年插秧一般都比去年提早半月左右。江西赣南地区的老农对比今年和往年的插秧期说：往年“清明”秧缠娘，今年“清明”秧嫁郎。
    已完成早稻插秧任务的广东全省和福建等省的一些地区，已在4月中旬开始对早稻田突击中耕除草和追肥。
    广东琼东、乐会、万宁等县的早稻，在这个阶段已开始抽穗扬花。
                              ＊
    在这半个月里，北方地区的农业社都在热火朝天的播种棉花、杂粮等作物。湖北、山东两省和关中、晋南、豫西、豫北等地已在“谷雨”以前完成了或基本上完成了今年的播棉任务。其他棉区，除少数季节较晚的地区以外，也都在4月中旬开始播种。
    今年各地播棉的特点是：播种期早、播得快而集中，播种质量也好。多数已播地区今年棉花播种期比去年提早十天左右，有些地区去年“谷雨”才播种，今年在“谷雨”前一、两天就全部播完。晋南曲沃等二十多个县，今年五天就结束了播棉工作，这是播得快而集中的事例之一。河北部分地区和豫北等地也在抗旱抢种棉花。旱象较重地区播种的棉花，出苗可能有困难。
    这些地区杂粮播种工作，也已先后开始。早动手的一些县，在“谷雨”已经播完。有些早播地区秧苗已经出土。
                                ＊
    这个期间全国大部分地区下雨很少。新疆、甘肃、陕西、山西、内蒙古等省（自治区）的绝大部分地区和东北地区的中部，在4月中旬十天中滴雨没下。东北地区的中部和南部、内蒙古大部、华北地区的西北部、甘肃东南部和云贵高原的大部地方，3月份雨量已较历年少，4月上、中旬降雨还是很少。这些地区都受到不同程度的干旱。为了不误农时，这里的干部和群众正在集中力量抗旱抢插、抢种。
