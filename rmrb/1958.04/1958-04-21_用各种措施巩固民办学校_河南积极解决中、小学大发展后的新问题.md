Using Various Measures to Consolidate People-Run Schools
Henan Actively Solves New Problems After the Great Development of Primary and Secondary Schools

According to Xinhua News Agency, among the 122 counties and cities in Henan Province, 114 counties and cities have universalized primary education and established many people-run secondary schools.

From the beginning of March to the present, several tens of thousands of new primary and secondary schools have been established throughout the province, opening the door to education for three million children and adolescents. The number of newly enrolled students accounts for 60% of the total number of primary and secondary school students in the province. Currently, there are more than seven million primary school students and 870,000 secondary school students in the province. 95% of children aged seven to twelve, and graduates of higher and junior primary schools under the age of twenty from previous years, have entered junior high schools and primary schools in various forms. A group of young people who graduated from literacy classes and young people from society with higher primary school level have also been admitted to secondary schools. Now, every township in the province has a middle school, every commune has a complete primary school, every family has a student, and the sound of reading can be heard everywhere.

All the tens of thousands of newly established primary and secondary schools are self-run by the masses. The school buildings of these schools are mostly offices and warehouses vacated by townships and communes, and private houses voluntarily given up by the masses. A small number of school buildings were built by commune members themselves, who contributed labor and materials. Desks and benches are mostly made of mud bricks, or brought by students themselves. The curriculum temporarily includes Chinese language, arithmetic, politics, and agricultural technology. In order to facilitate students' participation in production and enrollment, various forms such as alternating-day system, touring system, half-work half-study system, and early and late shifts have been adopted in various places according to different situations. Among the tens of thousands of cadres transferred to lower levels in Henan this year, 70% to 80% are intellectuals; each agricultural cooperative has always had some high school, junior high school, and higher primary school graduates; plus other intellectuals in the countryside with teaching ability, they have become the main source of teachers for these people-run schools. At present, all these newly established schools have started classes one after another.

The local Communist Party committees and relevant departments have actively led and supported this large-scale popular education movement, and have recently taken various measures to further consolidate and improve these schools. The normal schools in each prefecture have graduated a batch of students ahead of schedule and assigned them to work in newly established schools, and at the same time, they have promptly absorbed some teachers from newly established primary and secondary schools for short-term training and cultivation. On April 2nd, the six normal schools in Xinyang Prefecture established temporary teacher training classes and recruited more than 1,000 teachers from people-run schools to study in the classes. More than 900 students from Zhengzhou Normal College and the Provincial Educational Administration Cadre School also graduated ahead of schedule and went to work in various counties. Many prefectures have organized education inspection teams to go deep into various townships and communes to understand and help solve various problems after the popularization of education. Henan Xinhua Bookstore timely transferred five million textbooks from Hankou, and the Provincial People's Publishing House is working overtime to print agricultural technology textbooks and teaching materials. Recently, the entire province is launching a socialist school-running movement of mutual assistance, mutual learning, and mutual improvement between public and private, old and new schools, and those with good conditions supporting those with poor conditions.

Before liberation, Henan Province's education was relatively backward. In a province with more than 40 million people, there were only 100 middle schools with 30,000 students, and more than 10,000 primary schools with more than one million students. In the past few years after liberation, education has greatly developed, especially in 1957 when Henan vigorously developed people-run schools, the number of middle school students increased sharply by fourteen times compared with before liberation, reaching as many as 450,000; the number of primary school students increased four times, reaching more than five million. People-run schools have all implemented the socialist education policy of running schools diligently and frugally, combining work-study programs, and integrating education with labor.

    用各种措施巩固民办学校
    河南积极解决中、小学大发展后的新问题
    据新华社讯　河南省一百二十二个县、市中，已有一百一十四个县、市普及小学教育，并建立了不少民办中学。
    从3月初到目前止，全省共新办了几万所中、小学，为三百万儿童和少年打开了入学的大门，新入学人数占全省在校中、小学学生人数的60％。现在，全省已有小学生七百多万，中学生八十七万。全省95％的七岁到十二岁的儿童，二十岁以下的历届高小、初小毕业生，都分别进入了不同形式的初中和小学。一批扫盲学习毕业的青年和具有高小水平的社会青年也被吸收进入中学。现在全省乡乡有中学，社社有完小，家家有学生，到处有读书声。
    新办的几万所中、小学，全部是群众自办的。这些学校的校舍大部分是乡、社腾出的办公室、仓库和群众自愿让出的民房，少数校舍由社员献工献料亲手盖起。课桌板凳多是用泥坯垒起来的，或由学生自带。课程暂设有语文、算术、政治和农业技术等。为了便利学生参加生产和入学，各地根据不同情况采用了间日制、巡回制、半工半读制和早班晚班制等。河南今年下放的十几万干部中，百分之七、八十是知识分子；各农业社历年来都有一些高中、初中和高小毕业生；加上有教学能力的其他在乡知识分子，他们就成为这些民办学校的主要师资来源。目前，所有这些新办的学校都已经陆续开课。
    各地中共党委及有关部门积极领导和支持了这次大规模的普及教育运动，最近又采取了各种措施来进一步巩固和提高这些学校。各专区的师范学校都提早毕业一批学生，分配到新办的学校中去工作，同时又及时吸收了一些新办中小学的教员加以短期训练和培养。信阳专区的六所师范学校4月2日设立临时师资训练班，招收了一千多名民办学校的教员入班学习。郑州师范专科学校和省教育行政干部学校的九百多名学员也提早毕业分赴各县工作。不少专区组织了教育检查团，深入各乡、社了解和帮助解决普及教育后的各种问题。河南省新华书店及时从汉口调运了五百万册课本，省人民出版社正在连夜赶印农业技术课本和教科书。最近，全省正在开展一个公立支援民办、老校支援新校、条件好的支援条件差的互助、互学、互相提高的社会主义的办学运动。
    解放前，河南省的教育事业比较落后，在四千多万人口的省份里，只有一百所中学，学生三万人；小学一万多所，学生一百多万。解放后的几年来，教育事业有了很大的发展，特别是1957年河南大力发展了民办学校，中学学生比解放前激增十四倍，达四十五万之多；小学学生增加四倍，达五百多万。民办的学校都贯彻执行了勤俭办学、勤工俭学及教育和劳动相结合的社会主义教育方针。
