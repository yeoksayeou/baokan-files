    This newspaper reports: On March 31st, the front page of the Shanxi Daily published news about the Datong Mining Bureau leadership failing to adequately summarize and promote the advanced experience of the Zhao Fuqing tunneling team. In January of this year, the Zhao Fuqing tunneling team of Datong Mining Bureau's No. 3 Mine created the multi-hole tunneling method, setting a new record of advancing 1,009 meters per month. Currently, among the 176 tunneling teams in coal mines throughout Shanxi Province, only six teams advance 500 meters per month. The rest only advance 300 meters or 200 meters per month. After the great leap forward in coal mining, the contradiction between lagging tunneling and coal mining is very prominent. Tunneling workers are struggling to find ways to improve efficiency. The success of Zhao Fuqing's multi-hole tunneling method was like finding a treasure for tunneling workers throughout the province. However, the leaders of the Datong Mining Bureau neither summarized nor promoted it. When many workers requested its promotion, they remained indifferent. Why? The Shanxi Daily reported that this is because the leaders of the Datong Coal Mine are divorced from reality and do not consider issues from the current situation. Cheng Lifu, Secretary of the Datong Mining Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Wang Yunxin, Deputy Secretary, said that their mine is currently promoting two-and-a-half-hole tunneling and one-time single-heading excavation with a combine, and that multi-hole tunneling is not the direction being promoted. However, the Datong Mining Bureau currently only has one tunneling combine, and thirty to forty tunneling teams want to adopt Zhao Fuqing's multi-hole tunneling method.
    The Zhao Fuqing team's ability to achieve a record of advancing 1,000 meters per month is not only due to multi-hole tunneling but also to a complete set of experiences combining politics and professional work, and unifying politics and technology. The leaders of the Datong Mining Bureau have also neglected this good experience.

    凭主观定方向好经验不推广
    山西日报批评大同矿务局领导忽视新事物
    本报讯　3月31日，山西日报第一版刊载了大同矿务局领导上没有很好地总结和推广赵福清掘进组的先进经验的消息。大同矿务局三矿赵福清掘进组在今年1月创造多孔掘进法，创造了月进一千零九公尺的新纪录。目前，山西全省煤矿的一百七十六个掘进组中，月进五百公尺的只有六个小组。其余的只月进三百公尺或二百公尺。在煤矿大跃进以后，煤矿的掘进落后于采煤的矛盾，十分突出。掘进工人们都苦于无法提高效率，赵福清创造多孔掘进法成功，全省煤矿掘进工人如获至宝，但是，大同矿务局的领导既不总结，也不推广。当很多工人要求推广的时候，他们还是漠然置之。为什么呢？山西日报报道说，这是因为大同煤矿的领导脱离实际，考虑问题不从当前情况出发所造成的。中共大同矿委员会书记程力夫，副书记王蕴心说，他们矿现在提倡的是两孔半掘进和康拜因独眼一次成巷，多孔掘进，不是提倡的方向。但是大同矿务局现在只有一台掘进康拜因，还有三四十个掘进组都想采用赵福清的多孔掘进法。
    赵福清小组能达到月进一千公尺的纪录，不仅仅是多孔掘进，还有政治和业务相结合，政治和技术相统一的一套完整经验。大同矿务局的领导把这个好经验也忽视了。
