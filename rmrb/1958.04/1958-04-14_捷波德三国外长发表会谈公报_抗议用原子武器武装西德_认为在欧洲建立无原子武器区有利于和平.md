Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 12th: The joint communiqué adopted at the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic, which concluded this morning in Prague, stated that the ministers' opinions were completely consistent, and they reached unanimous conclusions on all issues discussed.

The meeting began on the 10th and was attended by Polish Acting Foreign Minister Naszkowski, Czechoslovak Foreign Minister David, and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz. In their discussions, they believed that the decision to arm the West German Bundeswehr with atomic weapons and rocket weapons increased tensions in Europe and aroused the legitimate concern and indignation of the people of all European countries.

The communiqué mentioned Poland's proposal for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Europe, believing that this proposal would help create an atmosphere of trust and facilitate the resolution of other issues. The communiqué emphasized that after Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic had already expressed their agreement with the Polish proposal, this important measure to safeguard European peace had not yet been realized, and the responsibility for this rested entirely with the West German government. The ministers reaffirmed their willingness to ensure effective supervision of the nuclear-weapon-free zone and their willingness to discuss the details with the relevant countries.

The three ministers said that the Soviet Union's proposal to hold high-level talks was of particular importance for resolving pressing international issues. The foreign ministers also welcomed the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease nuclear testing and hoped that the United States and British governments would also respond to the Soviet decision.

During the meeting, the three foreign ministers also exchanged views on the diplomatic policy measures that their governments might take.

The three ministers emphasized that the most reliable foundation for the security of their countries is the unity of the socialist camp and the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union and all other socialist countries.
