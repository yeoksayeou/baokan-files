Technical Innovation is an Important Part of Achieving a Great Leap Forward
Everyone in Rural Hubei Learns Technology

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch) Reporter Fang Di reports: A mass technical innovation movement is sweeping across the vast rural areas of Hubei Province with vigorous momentum. Many areas have seen a high tide of the whole Party learning technology and everyone learning technology, and are applying the technology they have learned to production.

The Xiangyang Special District, famous throughout the country for its large-scale water conservancy projects, now has 80% of its rural cadres having a preliminary grasp of water conservancy technology, and many people have also learned water conservancy technology. This special district originally planned to convert 500,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields last winter and this spring, but so far it has converted about 3 million mu. In order to ensure the good cultivation of these large numbers of newly added paddy fields, the district has universally adopted the method of "learning technology at all levels and doing good experiments at all levels," organizing cadres and the masses to learn how to grow rice. Twenty-one county committee members, eleven district committee secretaries, ninety-seven branch secretaries, and more than 1,662 production team leaders in Sui County all planted experimental rice paddies using the method of learning while doing. When they were working on land preparation, seed treatment, fertilization, and sowing, they also organized visits and comparisons while experimenting, imparting technology on the spot. As a result, the seedlings grew very well. The approach of the Xiaogan Special District to carry out the technical innovation movement is to run farmer technical night schools and engage in "six combinations" (combination of cadres and the masses, combination of new and old technologies, combination of lectures and visits, combination of decentralization and concentration, combination of learning technology and learning culture, etc.), and the progress of the movement is also relatively fast. According to the statistics of Hanchuan County alone, 1,426 farmer technical night schools have been set up, basically achieving "every team has a night school." The Huanggang Special District prominently grasped yield-increasing technologies such as deep plowing and close planting. According to surveys, the land that has been plowed in the district is generally four or five inches to six or seven inches deep, and some are as deep as one foot. The old habit of "plowing without three inches of soil" has been broken. The reform of agricultural tools has been universally carried out throughout the province and has already formed a high tide. Nearly twenty counties in the province have achieved "vehicle-ization" and "tractor-ization," and other improvements such as improved plows, seeders, and fertilizer applicators have also appeared in large numbers. Judging from the plans and preparations in various places, the area of double-cropping rice and single-cropping late japonica rice to be replanted this year in the province, as well as the area of dry land converted to paddy fields, the replacement of improved varieties, and the implementation of close planting, will all be many times greater than the requirements of the original plan of the provincial leadership.

At present, Hubei is boldly breaking with conventions in accordance with new technical requirements, vigorously implementing the technology of early rice seedling cultivation and strong seedlings, and carrying out cotton field sowing preparation work.

    技术革新是实现跃进的重要环节
    湖北农村人人学技术
    本报武汉讯　记者方堤报道：群众性的技术革新运动正以蓬勃的声势席卷湖北省的广大农村。许多地区已经出现了全党学技术、人人学技术的高潮，并且正在把学到的技术运用到生产中去。
    以大兴水利而闻名全国的襄阳专区，到目前止已经有80％的农村干部初步掌握了水利技术，群众中学会了水利技术的也很多。这个专区原计划在去冬今春把五十万亩旱地改成水田，但到目前止已经改了约三百万亩。为了保证这些大量新增水田的良好耕作，全区已普遍采用“层层学技术，层层搞好试验”的办法，组织干部和群众学习种水稻。随县二十一个县委委员、十一个区委书记、九十七个支部书记和一千六百六十二个生产队长以上的干部，都用边学边作的办法种了试验秧田。他们在进行整田、种子处理、施肥、播种等工作时，又都一面试验一面组织参观、评比，现场传授技术，结果秧苗长得很好。孝感专区开展技术革新运动的作法是办农民技术夜校和搞“六结合”（干部和群众结合，新、老技术结合，讲授与参观结合，分散与集中结合，学技术和学文化结合等），运动的进展也较快。仅据汉川县的统计，目前已经办起农民技术夜校一千四百二十六所，基本上作到了“队队有夜校”。黄冈专区突出地抓住了深耕和密植等项增产技术。据调查，全区已耕的田一般都深四、五寸到六、七寸，有少数深达一尺，“犁无三寸土”的旧习惯已经被打破。农具改革工作更已经在全省普遍开展，并且已经形成高潮。全省已有近二十个县实现了“车子化”、“拖子化”，其他像改良犁、播种器和施肥器等也出现得很多。从各地规划和准备情况看，全省今年改种双季稻和一季晚粳的面积，以及旱地改水田和换用良种和实行密植的面积，都将成倍地超过省领导方面原订规划的要求。
    目前，湖北各地正在按照新的技术要求，大胆地打破常规，大力贯彻早稻育秧、壮苗的技术，和进行棉田播种准备工作。
