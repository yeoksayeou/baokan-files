Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 10th: Yunnan, known by botanists as "Plant Home," is starting to utilize wild plants extensively and systematically from this year onward. There are already over seven thousand various wild plant processing factories under construction or planned.

Yunnan Province has complex terrain and climate, with a rich variety of plants from frigid, temperate, and tropical zones. The results of a general survey in twenty-five counties in 1957 alone revealed 1,455 varieties of wild plants. After testing and analysis, many of them can be used to make fibers, oils, starches, and to extract aromatic oils.

This year, relevant departments criticized the past conservative thinking that did not value the utilization of wild plants and began to utilize wild plants in a planned way. The over seven thousand factories already under construction or planned this year are mostly small-scale processing plants with investments of only a few hundred yuan. Among them, there are twelve processing plants producing one ton of rayon per day using wild fiber plants such as ramie, water ramie, and *Liriope spicata*. This year, the planned utilization of wild oil plants to produce oils can not only fully meet the needs of industrial oil in the province, but also produce 750,000 *jin* of edible oil. It is planned that the wine brewed from acorns will account for three-quarters of the province's total wine production, which can replace 200 million *jin* of grain, and the lees can also feed about 20,000 pigs. This year, it is also planned to export 1.5 million *jin* of aromatic oil extracted from *Litsea cubeba*, which can be exchanged for more than 36 million yuan worth of materials.

In order to meet the needs of wild plant processing factories, relevant departments in Yunnan Province and agricultural cooperatives in various places are actively taking measures such as holding training courses, exhibitions, technical exchange meetings, and establishing planting and processing bases for wild plants, to train personnel who can master planting, purchasing, and processing technologies. At the same time, orders for equipment such as winemaking and distillation equipment have been placed with industrial departments. The agricultural departments have begun to plant six kinds of wild plants with higher economic value, such as mint, *Litsea cubeba*, bay leaf, and geranium, on a relatively large area, of which the planting area of *Litsea cubeba* reaches 10,000 hectares. Plant research and testing institutions in the province are also actively identifying the composition and uses of wild plants according to production needs. The Industrial Department Testing Institute will submit test reports on six experimental projects, including the extraction of solid baking glue from acorns and the production of violet ketones from *Litsea cubeba*, within April.

    植物之家——云南
    建立七千个野生植物加工厂
    据新华社昆明10日电　被植物学家们称为“植物之家”的云南，从今年起开始有计划地广泛利用野生植物。现在已经动工和计划建立的各种野生植物加工厂共有七千多个。
    云南省的地形和气候复杂，生长着种类丰富的寒带、温带和热带的植物。仅1957年在二十五个县普查的结果，就发现了一千四百五十五个野生植物的品种。经过化验测定，其中有许多可以制作纤维、油脂、淀粉和提炼芳香油。
    今年各有关部门批判了过去不重视利用野生植物的保守思想，开始有计划地利用野生植物。今年已经动工和计划建立的七千多个工厂，大都是投资只几百元的小型加工厂。其中用活麻、水麻和龙须草等野生纤维植物制作人造棉日产一吨的加工厂就有十二个。今年计划利用野生油料植物加工生产的油脂，不仅可以全部满足省内工业用油的需要，而且还可以生产七十五万斤食用油；计划用橡子酿的酒，将占全省酿酒总产量的四分之三，可以代替粮食两亿斤，酒糟还能喂养约两万头猪。今年还计划出口一百五十万斤从山苍子中提炼的芳香油，可以换回三千六百多万元的物资。
    为了满足野生植物加工厂的需要，云南省各有关部门和各地农业社正在积极采取举办训练班、展览会、技术交流会和建立种植、加工野生植物基地等措施，培养能掌握种植、采购和加工技术的人员，同时已向工业部门订购了酿酒、蒸馏等设备。农业部门已经开始较大面积地种植经济价值较高的薄荷、山苍子、香叶、天竹葵等六种野生植物，其中山苍子的种植面积达一万公顷。省内的植物研究和试验机构也在根据生产需要，积极鉴定野生植物的成分和用途。工业厅试验所在4月份内，将提出关于从橡子中提炼固体烤胶、用山苍子制紫萝兰硐等六个试验项目的化验测定。
