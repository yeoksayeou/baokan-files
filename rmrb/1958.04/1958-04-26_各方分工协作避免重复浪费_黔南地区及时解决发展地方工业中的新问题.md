　　(Our Dispatch) Reporter Guo Longchun reports: Various parties working together and collaborating, with everyone "using steel where it counts most," will be a characteristic of Qiannan region’s future development of local industry in Guizhou Province.

　　The broad masses of cadres and people in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture are highly enthusiastic about developing local industry. According to incomplete statistics as of early April, the prefecture has newly established more than 160 local state-owned factories and mines, which is more than five times the number of original factories and mines last year. There are already thousands of small factories and mines run by agricultural cooperatives. These factories and mines have played a very good role in supporting agricultural production and supplying the needs of the people's lives. However, due to a lack of experience, there are some uncoordinated phenomena in the plans of some regions and departments to develop local industry. For example, in Wangmo County, according to the plans of the county, townships, agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and commercial departments, a total of more than 20 rayon factories are to be built here. In Ziyun County, regarding a mercury mine, the prefecture, county, handicraft department, and labor reform department all plan to mine the same resource. If these problems are not solved in time, it will cause a waste of manpower and materials and make the supply of certain raw materials tight. At present, some regions and departments have already had disputes because of conflicting projects; some projects cannot be started for a long time, and the enthusiasm cannot be fully utilized.

　　In order to enable local industry to develop by leaps and bounds in a planned way, the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a county party committee secretary meeting to study the division of labor and cooperation of various levels and departments in running industry. The meeting first clarified some vague ideas among the cadres, such as some people having the simple viewpoint of pursuing profits and vying to run projects with high profits; some departments hoping to "not ask for help from anyone" and each setting up its own complete system from raw materials and processing to production, and so on. The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to earnestly implement the principle of local industry "serving agricultural production, serving large-scale industry, serving the lives of urban and rural people, and serving exports," and at the same time to divide labor and cooperate closely.

　　The meeting determined the division of labor principles for the five levels of prefecture, county, district, township, and cooperative, and various economic departments in running industry. The prefecture and county are responsible for establishing key enterprises with larger scale and higher technology in the prefecture and county. Agricultural cooperatives run seasonal, sideline, and technically simple processing plants and small mines, mainly for self-production and self-use. Districts and townships run a number of small factories and mines according to local resources and needs. Economic departments other than local industrial departments mainly run relevant industries according to their own business nature. For example, the grain department runs flour processing plants and some oil processing plants. The Second Commercial Bureau runs factories for processing wild starch, wild oil, and pastries; the rosin factory and antimony mine that they originally planned to build will be handled by the forestry industry and local industrial departments respectively.

　　The meeting especially studied the relationship between handicrafts and other departments in running industry. The meeting pointed out that handicrafts are a powerful assistant to local state-owned industry and have great potential, and their role should be fully utilized. Factories should not be run by squeezing out handicrafts. Relevant departments should divide labor and cooperate. If handicrafts already exist and can guarantee the needs (such as the production of sleeping mats, straw hats, etc.), other departments do not need to run them. The mining and other businesses that the handicraft department did not operate in the past do not need to be operated now. The manufacturing and repair business of agricultural implements, which is in great demand, can be handled by both local state-owned industry and handicraft departments; districts and townships mainly rely on handicraft departments. Some projects that local state-owned industry must run (such as sugar pressing, etc.), although handicrafts exist, local state-owned industry can also run them. Local state-owned industry should support handicrafts in terms of raw materials, etc., and handicrafts should support local state-owned industry in terms of technical strength, etc.

　　After the division of labor and cooperation problem was solved, duplication and waste were avoided, enabling all parties to use their strength in a focused and planned way. This time, the prefecture and county transferred some smaller-scale projects with lower technical requirements to the county and districts and townships to run, so that they could concentrate their efforts on running key projects. After the Autonomous Prefecture Industrial Bureau handed over the flour factory originally planned to be built to the grain department for construction, it freed up 250,000 yuan of funds and invested in major factories and mines such as steel plants and flax spinning factories. The handicraft department can concentrate on improving handicraft skills and operating agricultural implement repair and other businesses without mining.

### 各方分工协作避免重复浪费  黔南地区及时解决发展地方工业中的新问题

    各方分工协作避免重复浪费
    黔南地区及时解决发展地方工业中的新问题
    本报讯　记者郭龙春报道：各方面分工协作，大家都“把钢使在刀刃上”，这将是贵州省黔南地区今后发展地方工业的一个特色。
    黔南布依族苗族自治州的广大干部、群众，对发展地方工业积极性很高。截至4月上旬的不完全统计，全州已经新办起一百六十多个地方国营厂矿，相当于去年原有厂矿数目的五倍以上。农业社办的小型厂矿，已经有几千个。这些厂矿在支援农业生产，供应人民生活需要等方面起了很好的作用。但是由于缺乏经验，有些地区和部门发展地方工业的规划中，也有某些不够协调的现象。例如，望谟县有一个区，按照县、乡、农业社、手工业社和商业部门的规划，共要在这里建设二十多个人造棉厂。紫云县有个汞矿，同一资源，州、县、手工业部门和劳改部门都计划开采。这些问题如不及时解决，将会造成人力、物力的浪费，并使某些原料供应紧张。目前，有的地区和部门因为项目冲突，已经发生争执；有的项目大家迟迟不能动工，不能充分发挥积极性。
    为了使地方工业有计划地大踏步地发展，中共黔南布依族苗族自治州委员会最近召开的县委书记会议，研究了各级、各部门办工业的分工协作问题。会议首先澄清了干部中某些模糊的思想，如有的人有单纯追求利润的观点，争着办利润大的项目；有的部门希望“万事不求人”，从原料、加工一直到生产，自己都各搞一套等等。会议强调要切实贯彻执行地方工业“为农业生产服务，为大工业服务、为城乡人民生活服务、为出口服务”的原则，同时要分工协作，密切配合。
    会议确定了州、县、区、乡、社五级和各经济部门办工业的分工原则。州、县负责兴办本州、本县骨干性的规模较大、技术较高的企业。农业社举办季节性、副业性、技术简单的加工厂和小矿，主要是自产自用。区、乡根据当地的资源、需要，办一批小型厂矿。地方工业部门以外的其他经济部门，主要根据本身的业务性质办有关工业。例如，粮食部门办面粉加工厂和部分油料加工厂。第二商业局办野生淀粉加工、野生油料加工、糕点等工厂；他们原来计划兴建的松香厂、锑矿等，分别由森工、地方工业等部门去办。
    会议特别研究了手工业同其他部门办工业的关系问题。会议指出：手工业是地方国营工业的有力助手，而且潜力很大，应该充分发挥它们的作用，不能用挤掉手工业的办法来办工厂。各有关部门应该分工协作。手工业已经有了，而且能保证需要的项目（如生产凉席、草帽等），其他部门就不必办了。手工业部门过去没有经营的采矿等业务，现在也不必去经营。需要很大的农具制造、修配业务，地方国营工业和手工业部门都可以办；区、乡以手工业部门为主。一些地方国营工业必须办的项目（如榨糖等），手工业虽有，地方国营工业也可以去办。地方国营工业应该在原料等方面支援手工业，手工业应该在技术力量等方面支援地方国营工业。
    分工协作问题解决以后，避免了重复浪费，使各方面都能够有重点有计划地使用力量。州、县这次把一部分规模较小、技术要求较低的项目，分别下放给县和区、乡去兴办，自己就可以集中力量办重点项目。自治州工业局把原来计划兴建的面粉厂交由粮食部门建设以后，便腾出了二十五万元资金，投入钢铁厂、麻纺厂等主要厂矿。手工业部门不去开矿，便可以集中力量提高手工工艺，经营农具修配等业务。
