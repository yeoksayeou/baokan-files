    Jiang Muliang Plants "Experimental Plot"
    The old writer Jiang Muliang arrived in Sanxianhu Township, Nanxian County, Hunan Province last November. Now he is the deputy secretary of the General Party Branch of this township. In addition to working hard to do a good job in the township's General Branch, he has also planted an experimental plot of 1.2 mu in the Zhongqi Agricultural Cooperative. He is very attentive to field production. He applied manure to the field, accumulated 120 dan of mixed fertilizer, and used ammonium sulfate mixed with fine mud as top dressing. He is learning to grow double-cropping rice from experienced old farmers, striving to produce 1,500 jin of grain per mu in his own experimental plot.

    蒋牧良种“试验田”
    老作家蒋牧良是在去年11月到湖南省南县三仙湖乡的。现在他是这个乡的中共总支副书记，每天他除努力作好乡总支的工作外，还在中骑农业社种了一亩二分试验田。他对田间生产很用心。在田里施了粪肥，还积了一百二十担混合肥，并用硫酸錏拌细泥作追肥。他正在向有经验的老农学习种双季稻，争取在自己的试验田里每亩产粮一千五百斤。
