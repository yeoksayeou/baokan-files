Xinhua News Agency, April 13th, New York dispatch: Four Americans, aboard a small boat, are sailing to the US nuclear weapons testing area in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific, determined to protest the United States' continued nuclear weapons testing even at the cost of their lives.

These four Americans are all members of the American "Non-Violent Action Against Nuclear Weapons Peace Organization." Their small boat, named "Golden Rule," departed from San Francisco on March 25th and is currently nearing Honolulu, from where it will sail to the Marshall Islands. The United States is scheduled to conduct a nuclear weapons test on Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands in mid-April.

The US Atomic Energy Commission specifically announced on the 11th that it prohibits American citizens from traveling to the US nuclear weapons testing area in the Pacific, and violators will be arrested and punished. However, the captain of the "Golden Rule," Albert Bigelow, issued a statement via radio from his ship on the evening of the 11th, saying that the "Golden Rule" would disregard the Atomic Energy Commission's decision and continue to sail to its intended destination. He said, "No matter what happens, we will keep sailing to the testing area."

    四个美国人乘小艇前往马绍尔
    舍命阻拦美国核试验
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：四个美国人乘坐了一艘小艇正在开往太平洋马绍尔群岛的美国核武器试验地区，决心用牺牲生命的精神来抗议美国继续进行核武器试验。
    这四个美国人都是美国“非暴力反对核武器和平组织”的成员。他们的名叫“金律号”的小艇3月25日从旧金山出发，目前即将到达檀香山，并且将从那里开往马绍尔群岛。美国预定在4月中在马绍尔群岛的恩纳威托克岛上进行核武器试验。
    美国政府原子能委员会11日为此特别宣布，禁止美国公民前往太平洋中美国进行核武器试验的地区，违反者将加以逮捕和惩处。但是，“金律号”艇长艾伯特·比格劳11日晚间从他的船上用无线电机发表声明说，“金律号”将不顾原子能委员会的决定，继续向预定目的地航行。他说：“不管发生什么事情，我们都要一直开到试验地区。”
