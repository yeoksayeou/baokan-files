    Chinese Parasol Seeds
    The Chinese parasol tree, also known as the Qingtong tree, Chutong tree, Ertong tree, or Tongma tree, belongs to the Sterculiaceae family and is a deciduous tree. The tree is tall with smooth bark, blooms with green flowers, and the fruit has a long, membranous exterior, about two to three inches long, containing brownish-yellow, round seeds, which are the Chinese parasol seeds.

    The trunk of the Chinese parasol tree is straight and grows rapidly. The wood is white, light, and soft, suitable for making boxes and musical instruments. The material contains mucus that can be used to make "pao hua" (used by rural women for hairdressing). Throwing the leaves into the toilet pit can prevent the breeding of maggots and can also be used medicinally. The bark has many fibers and can be used to make paper and Chinese parasol fiber. Chinese parasol seeds can be stir-fried and eaten, or oil can be extracted.

    Tests have shown that Chinese parasol seeds have an oil content of 39.69%, and the oil yield is generally about 30%. Chinese parasol seed oil is dark brown, a non-drying oil, and can be used to make soap; hardened oil can be used for lighting lamps, lubricating vehicles, and can also be eaten.
