    "Luoyang" Brand Automobile
    After twenty-two days of hard work, the workers of the Luoyang Automobile Repair Factory trial-produced a type of automobile suitable for agricultural production. This small car was named "Luoyang Brand." After a five-kilometer short-distance test drive, the results were good.

    The Luoyang Brand automobile can carry 1.5 tons, is 4.5 meters long, one inch wider than the average horse-drawn cart, is nimble, sturdy, and suitable for driving on rural dirt roads. The car has four cylinders, 30 horsepower, a speed of 60 kilometers per hour, and can climb steep slopes of 30 degrees. The workers of the Luoyang Automobile Repair Factory, considering the current difficulties in the production of liquid fuels in our country and the economic conditions of the countryside, specially installed a coal furnace in the car. In addition to burning gasoline, it can also burn anthracite coal and charcoal. In order to adapt to the needs of rural production, they also installed a transmission box in the car, which can be used for power generation, tree felling, sawing wood, belt grinding, and water pumping. The car trough is also designed according to the characteristics of rural production. The car trough is also equipped with flower guards, which can be propped into a "?" shape when in use, expanding outward by 0.4 meters, which is convenient for rural areas to load and transport straw, cotton stalks, wheat straw, and other items. The workers of the Luoyang Automobile Repair Factory are preparing to produce fifty of these small cars in the second quarter of this year.
