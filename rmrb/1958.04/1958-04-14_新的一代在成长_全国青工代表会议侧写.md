A new generation is growing up
——A Profile of the National Youth Workers' Representative Conference
By Our Correspondents Zhang Feng and Zhou Li

Thirty-one years ago, in the spring, the young working class of Shanghai raised the victorious red flag of armed uprising in this big city; thirty-one years later, youth worker heroes from all over the country have gathered in Shanghai to sound the bugle for the technical revolution. This may seem like a coincidence, but it reveals a red line of historical development: the older generation of Chinese workers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, finally achieved the victory of the revolution after arduous and tortuous struggles; the new generation is now growing up under the cultivation of the Party, and is shouldering the heavy responsibility of building socialism and communism together with their fathers and brothers, leaping forward!

These days, at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Shanghai, at the National Youth Workers' Representative Conference, we are in contact with the new generation of the working class every day, and we hear their heroic voices every day. We have found that most of these young people, who have made great achievements in various aspects of the motherland's construction, only joined the ranks of the working class around the beginning of the first five-year plan. They started their lifelong heroic careers in Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel, in Karamay, Sanmenxia, and Xin'anjiang, in the Changchun Automobile Factory, the Luoyang Tractor Factory, in thousands of factories, construction sites, in the sky, and in the mines all over China, together with the socialist construction of the motherland. Their hands made outstanding contributions in the first five-year plan, and they tempered themselves into a strong new force in the great furnace of the working class.

On the eve of the technical revolution, this new force gathered in Shanghai to comprehensively review its ranks. At this grand review ceremony, we heard: in Taiyuan, molten steel in the open-hearth furnace flowed out of three troughs, achieving a major achievement in steelmaking; in Shanghai, reached the peak of dye industry technology, made the non-fading reactive dyes invented by the British the year before last, and trial-produced purple reactive dyes that the British do not yet have. In Nanjing, young fitter Song Tingxiang is known as the "igniter" of technical innovation. He created a mold that improves efficiency six hundred times; in Shenyang, female turner Wei Fengying's technical innovations won seven battles and seven victories, and one day's work is equal to fifteen days. Father Time has been left far behind by these young people. A young grinding team in Qiqihar has already stepped into 1967. Liao Sirong, a driller from Chongqing who entered the factory in 1953, used a pair of strong hands to compress the future five years into fifty-three days! On the road to the technical revolution, many people have taken the first step in this way, and more people are preparing and eager to try. Listen! The new generation shouted out such slogans: declare war on technology, race against rockets! We must have what the world doesn't have! We must do what our predecessors have not done! We want to write our own glorious deeds in the annals of "catching up with Britain"!

The new generation that has grown up is a group of heroes who are not afraid of heaven or earth. In their minds, there are no insurmountable difficulties, only great ideals and a vibrant optimism. A Tibetan youth drilling mine commando team, in order to mine the treasures under the ice and snow peaks of the Kangzang Plateau, lived in tents, ate undercooked rice, and opened roads and climbed mountains in snow that was one person deep. Sometimes their fingers were so frozen that the ice stuck to the steel drill, and the ice on their hair stuck to the planks, but for the sake of the motherland and for the sake of the future, what did this matter? The task was still overfulfilled every month. The 30,000 young workers fighting in the uninhabited Qaidam Basin, where the desert stretches for eight hundred miles, had ice frozen on their hats and clothes in the severe cold, but they said: wearing silver helmets and silver armor, how majestic. Camping on the beach, they happily sang: "The beach is better than a steel spring bed, the moonlight is brighter than electric lights." They put forward the construction speed of "one year for general survey, two years for drilling, three years for oil production, and four years for refining." They wrote their ideals into heroic poems: "Ten years of hard work without changing shifts, crude oil overflows Yumen Pass."

We not only heard such heroic voices, but also saw the noble qualities of the working class shining like pearls on the new generation. They have the idea of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me." A female worker from a cigarette factory in Jinan said so simply: "When I am in the factory, I feel heartache when I see a piece of paper wasted. I am very afraid of putting in an empty cigarette, which will affect the factory's reputation. Because I know that the factory is ours, working is for everyone, and also for ourselves." A young milling worker in Shanghai said so movingly: "Every time I improve my skills, I compress the working hours quota, and I never want to get paid overtime without effort. Some people say I am a fool, but I am not a fool. I know that labor is for socialism." Everything is for socialism. Whether in big factories or small factories, in all kinds of ordinary labor positions, young workers regard their work as a part of a great cause, and dedicate their youth to it! Fan Xiumei, a twenty-year-old female worker in Tianjin, has been picking up waste products every day for five years, without fear of dirt or fatigue, and picks out valuable industrial raw materials from the waste products. She announced at the conference: "Waste products become gold, I am determined to do it for a lifetime."

In the process of the growth of the new generation, it is by no means without twists and turns. Most of the young people come from small producers' families, and some even come from exploiters' families. The ideas of the original classes hinder their growth and make them take many tortuous roads. Every representative's speech excitedly said a loud word: Party. They said: It is the Party that constantly cares for and cultivates us, and leads us to straighten out the tortuous roads. Young fitter Song Tingxiang expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Party in his speech. Before 1956, he had not made any technical improvements and often made trouble with his emotions, echoing a small number of backward workers in making trouble with wages. Only after the Party helped him to get on the right track did he concentrate on working for socialism, and finally created a mold that improved efficiency six hundred times and grew into an outstanding successor of the working class.

At this review conference of the working class's new force, many representatives talked again and again about the help of the old workers to their growth. They welcomed the old workers who were invited to the meeting with applause that lasted like thunder. They listened to the speeches of the old hero Meng Tai, the revolutionary mother Shi Xiaomei, and many old Shanghai workers who had participated in the three armed uprisings, and also visited the families of more than 60 old Shanghai workers. The old workers earnestly taught their younger generations how to work and how to live, and the young people kept these words in mind and regarded the old workers as their role models. The representatives from the Songhua River said: "The youth workers in Harbin are launching a movement to learn from the famous old milling worker Su Guangming." Their slogan is: "Learn from Su Guangming, catch up with Su Guangming, everyone becomes Su Guangming."

Seeing the new generation growing up so vigorously, many old workers laughed. The participants of the three armed uprisings said: "Seeing you, the old men in their fifties and sixties are also happy to become young men!" Seeing and hearing this, we couldn't help but think of four months ago, also in this Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, Premier Zhou Enlai invited representatives of old workers and young workers in Shanghai to hold a forum. Premier Zhou said at that meeting: In Shanghai, I saw many young cadres from working-class backgrounds. In them, I can still feel the revolutionary spirit of the old generation of Shanghai workers who were lively, willing to work hard, and not afraid of difficulties, but they are more mature than we were back then because they grew up in the socialist era...

Yes, the older generation of workers has opened up a vast development path for the younger generation. They are about to enter the 21st century, and the great ideal of communism will be realized in their hands.

    新的一代在成长
    ——全国青工代表会议侧写
    本报记者　张风　周立
    三十一年前的春天，年轻的上海工人阶级在这个大城市里举起了武装起义胜利的红旗；三十一年后的现在，全国各路青工英雄又在上海会师，吹响了技术革命进军的号角。这个似乎是巧合，却揭示出一条历史发展的红线：老一代的中国工人在共产党领导下，经过艰苦曲折的斗争，终于取得了革命的胜利；新的一代又正在党的培养下成长起来，和父兄们一起肩负着建设社会主义、共产主义的重任，飞跃向前！
    这些天来，我们在上海中苏友好大厦里，在全国青年工人代表会议上，天天和工人阶级的新的一代接触，天天听到他们的豪迈的声音。我们发现，这些在祖国建设事业的各个方面立下了丰功伟绩的青年，大部分都是在第一个五年计划开始前后，才参加工人阶级的队伍。他们在鞍钢、武钢和包钢，在克拉玛依、三门峡和新安江，在长春的汽车厂、洛阳的拖拉机厂，在全中国成千成万的工厂里、工地上、天空中、矿井下，和祖国的社会主义建设一起开始了毕生的英雄事业。他们的双手在第一个五年计划中作出了卓越的贡献，而且在工人阶级的巨大熔炉内把自己炼成一支强大的生力军。
    正当技术革命的前夜，这支生力军在上海会师，全面地检阅自己的队伍。就在这个盛大的检阅典礼上，我们听到：在太原，平炉中的钢水从三个槽子中沸腾流出，在炼钢中取得了重大成就；在上海，攀上了染料工业技术的高峰，制成英国前年才发明的永不褪色的活性染料，并且试制出英国还没有的紫色活性染料。在南京，青年钳工宋庭祥被誉为技术革新的“点火人”，他创造一个模具提高效率六百倍；在沈阳，女车工尉凤英技术革新七战七捷，一天的工作量等于十五天。时间老人被小伙子们远远地丢在他们的后面，齐齐哈尔的一个青年磨工小组已经跨进1967年。1953年才进厂的重庆钻工廖思荣，用一双粗壮有力的手把未来的五年压缩成五十三天！在通向技术革命的道路上，许多人就这样迈开了第一步，更多的人正在秣马厉兵，跃跃欲试。听吧！新的一代喊出了这样的口号：向技术宣战，跟火箭赛跑！世界上没有的事，我们要有！前人未做过的事，我们要做！我们要在“赶过英国”的史册上，写下自己的光辉事迹！
    成长起来的新的一代，都是些天不怕、地不怕的英雄好汉。在他们的心目中，没有不可克服的困难，有的是伟大的理想和朝气勃勃的乐观精神。一支藏族青年的钻矿突击队，为了挖掘康藏高原冰山雪峰下的宝藏，住帐篷，吃夹生饭，在一人深的积雪中开路登山，有时冻得手指的冰结在钢钎上，头发的冰结在铺板上，但是，为了祖国，为了未来，这一点算得了什么，任务依然月月超额完成。战斗在八百里瀚海无人烟的柴达木盆地上的三万青年职工，严寒中帽子和衣服上都冻了冰，他们却说：头戴银盔，身披银甲，多么威武。露宿在沙滩上，他们愉快地唱出：“沙滩赛过钢丝床，电灯那有月儿亮”。他们提出了“一年普查两年钻，三年出油四年炼”的建设速度，他们把自己的理想写成了豪迈的诗句：“十年大干不换班，原油漫过玉门关”。
    我们不但听到这样豪迈的声音，还看到闪耀在新的一代身上的，像珍珠一般光芒四射的工人阶级高贵品质。他们有着我为人人，人人为我的思想。济南的一位烟厂女工讲得多么朴素：“我在厂里，看到一张纸糟蹋了也觉得心疼，我深怕装进一支空头烟，影响工厂的名誉。因为我知道，工厂是我们的，干活是为了大家，也是为自己。”上海的一位青年铣工讲得多么动人：“我每一次提高技术，就压缩一次工时定额，决不想不费气力，白拿超额工资。有人说我是傻瓜，我才不是傻瓜，我知道劳动是为了社会主义。”一切为了社会主义，不论在大厂、在小厂，在各种平凡劳动的岗位上，青年工人们都把自己的工作看作是伟大的事业的一部分，为它献出自己的青春！天津市二十岁的女工范秀梅，五年如一日，天天拣废品，不怕脏，不怕累，从废品中拣出宝贵的工业原料。她在大会上宣布：“废品变黄金，决心干一生。”
  在新的一代成长的过程中，决不是没有曲折的。大部分青年来自小生产者的家庭，有的还来自剥削者的家庭，原来阶级的思想阻碍着他们成长，使他们走了不少曲折的道路。每一个代表的发言，都激动地讲出一个响亮的字眼：党。他们说：是党，不断关心着培养着我们，领导我们把曲折的道路拉直。青年钳工宋庭祥，他在发言中讲出了对党的由衷的感激。他在1956年前，技术上半点改进也没有，经常闹情绪，附和少数落后工人闹工资。只有在党帮助他走上了正路以后，他才专心一志为社会主义劳动，终于创造了提高效率六百倍的模具，成长为工人阶级的优秀接班人。
  在这个工人阶级生力军的检阅大会上，许多代表都一次再一次地谈到老工人对自己成长的帮助。他们以春雷一般久久不息的掌声欢迎邀请到会的老工人发言。他们听到了老英雄孟泰、革命妈妈施小妹，和许多参加过三次武装起义的上海老工人的讲话，还访问了六十多位上海老工人的家庭。老工人谆谆教导自己的后辈应该如何工作，如何生活，青年们都把这些话牢记在心，把老工人当作自己的榜样。来自松花江畔的代表们说：“哈尔滨全市青年职工正在开展学习著名老铣工苏广铭的运动。”他们的口号是：“学习苏广铭，赶上苏广铭，人人都做苏广铭。”
    看到新的一代正在这样茁壮地成长，许多老工人都笑了。三次武装起义的参加者说：“看到你们，五六十岁的老头子也快活得成了小伙子啦！”看到听到这些，我们不由得想起四个月之前，也是在这中苏友好大厦里，周恩来总理曾经请上海的老工人代表和青年工人代表举行座谈。周总理在那次会上说：在上海看到了好多工人出身的青年干部，在他们身上还可以感到老一代的上海工人当年那种活泼肯干、不怕困难的革命劲头，但是比我们当年更加成熟了，因为他们生长在社会主义时代……。
    是的，老一代的工人为青年一代开拓了广阔无垠的发展道路，他们将要进入二十一世纪，共产主义的伟大理想，将在他们手里实现。
