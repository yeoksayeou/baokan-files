Let's See the Next Step of the West German Government
By Our Correspondent

Recently, Soviet First Deputy Premier Mikoyan and Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Kumykin visited West Germany and formally signed the Soviet-West German Economic and Trade Agreement and Consular Treaty with West German Foreign Minister Brentano. Mikoyan also held talks with Adenauer, and the two countries issued a joint communiqué after the talks. The communiqué stipulated that the two countries would continue negotiations on the exchange of cultural and scientific issues this year. The communiqué also emphasized that the two governments will do everything possible, in a spirit of understanding, to gradually improve relations between the two countries, thereby contributing to the safeguarding of lasting peace.

The signing of the Soviet-West German Economic and Trade Agreement and the joint communiqué issued by Mikoyan and Adenauer are a development in the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany since the establishment of diplomatic relations. The Soviet-West German Economic and Trade Agreement will not only strengthen economic ties between the two countries, but, as West German business leaders have pointed out, it will play a positive role in overcoming West Germany's current economic recession, thereby creating a good foundation for improving relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany.

West Germany is located in the center of Europe. Since the war, American and German aggressive forces have been trying to turn West Germany into a war base against the Soviet Union and communism, and have been trying to support German militarists as shock forces for launching wars. It is precisely because of this policy of the United States and German militarist forces that the tense situation in Europe has been created. Recently, the United States and West Germany have further implemented arms expansion and war preparation, deciding to equip West German troops with atomic weapons and build atomic rocket bases on West German territory aimed at the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, which has further intensified the tense situation in Europe.

This approach by the United States and West Germany first exposes West Germany to the threat of atomic war. Contrary to the attitude of the United States and the West German government, the Soviet Union has consistently strived to improve relations with West Germany and ease tensions in Europe. During his visit to West Germany this time, Mikoyan again made a solemn guarantee to West Germany: If West German territory becomes a nuclear weapon-free and rocket weapon-free zone, then even if there is a military conflict involving West Germany, the Soviet Union is not prepared to use nuclear weapons and atomic weapons against any targets in West Germany. The Soviet government's guarantee fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's sincerity in trying to ensure that Europe is spared the scourge of atomic war. Obviously, this is of great benefit to eliminating the existing hostility between the Soviet Union and West Germany and easing the situation in Europe.

The West German people and broad social figures resolutely oppose the "atomic death" policy of the United States and the West German government, and unanimously demand to get rid of the threat of atomic war. Now, the Soviet Union has made a guarantee to West Germany to free West Germany from the disaster of atomic destruction. In this case, what reason does the West German government have to continue to adhere to its "atomic death" policy!

Although relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany have improved due to the signing of the economic and trade agreement between the two countries and the talks between Mikoyan and Adenauer, the fundamental improvement of relations between the two countries must have a peaceful environment. The complete normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and West Germany is an important step in ensuring European security. The Soviet Union has made significant efforts to ensure European security and ease relations with West Germany. Now, the question is to see how the West German government is prepared to implement what both sides emphasized in the communiqué: to do everything possible to contribute to safeguarding peace. It is obvious that continuing to adhere to the atomic arms race policy runs counter to this desire.

    且看西德政府下一步
    本报评论员
    最近，苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬和苏联对外贸易部副部长库米金到西德和西德外交部长勃伦塔诺正式签订了苏联—西德经济贸易协定和领事条约。米高扬并且还和阿登纳举行了会谈，会谈后两国发表了会谈公报。公报规定两国在今年继续就交流文化和科学问题进行谈判。公报并着重指出，两国政府将尽一切力量，本着谅解的精神来逐步改善两国的关系，从而对保障持久和平作出贡献。
    苏联—西德经济贸易协定的签订以及米高扬和阿登纳发表的会谈公报是苏联和西德两国自建立外交关系以来两国关系正常化的一个发展。苏联和西德的经济贸易协定不仅将加强两国的经济联系，并且像西德企业界人士所指出的，它对克服目前西德的经济衰退将起积极的作用，从而也能为改善苏联和西德的关系创立良好的基础。
    西德地处欧洲的中心，战后以来美国和德国侵略势力一直企图把西德变为反苏反共的战争基地，并且竭力扶植德国军国主义分子作为他们发动战争的突击力量。正是由于美国和德国军国主义势力的这种政策，造成了欧洲的紧张局势。最近，美国和西德更进一步实行扩军备战，决定以原子武器装备西德部队，并在西德领土上建立针对苏联和其他社会主义国家的原子火箭基地，这就使得欧洲的紧张局势更为加剧了。
    美国和西德的这种做法，首先使西德遭受着原子战争的威胁。和美国以及西德政府的态度相反，苏联一贯为改善同西德的关系，争取缓和欧洲紧张局势而努力。这次米高扬在访问西德时，又向西德提出了一项庄严的保证：假如西德的领土成为无核武器和火箭武器地区，那么，即使发生有西德参加的军事冲突，苏联也不准备对西德的任何目标使用核武器和原子武器。苏联政府的这项保证充分表现了苏联百般设法保障欧洲避免遭受原子战争荼毒的诚意。显然这对于消除现存的苏联和西德之间的敌意以及缓和欧洲的局势有很大的好处。
    西德人民和广泛的社会人士坚决反对美国和西德政府的“原子死亡”政策，一致要求摆脱原子战争的威胁。现在，苏联已对西德提出使西德摆脱原子毁灭的灾祸的保证。在这种情况下，西德政府还有什么理由继续坚持它的“原子死亡”政策呢！
    苏联和西德的关系虽然由于两国之间的经济贸易协定的签订以及米高扬和阿登纳的会谈而得到了改善，但是两国关系的根本改善必须要有一个和平的环境。苏联和西德关系的完全正常化是保障欧洲安全的重要步骤。苏联为保障欧洲的安全和缓和同西德的关系已作了重大的努力，那么，现在的问题是要看西德政府准备怎样实现公报中双方所着重指出的：尽一切力量对保障和平作出贡献。显而易见，继续坚持原子备战政策，是同这个愿望背道而驰的。
