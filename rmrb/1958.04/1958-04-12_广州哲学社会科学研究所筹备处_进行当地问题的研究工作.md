The Guangzhou Philosophy and Social Sciences Research Institute Preparatory Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is currently focused on gradually developing scientific research around the collection of materials.

In the field of philosophy, based on the collection of academic materials from Guangdong philosophers in 1957, special research was conducted on the philosophical thought of Chen Xianzhang (Baisha), and a preliminary draft of a research paper on Chen Xianzhang's philosophical thought, approximately 160,000 words, has been written. The task for 1958 is to collect and organize materials related to the philosophical thought of Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, Sun Yat-sen, and others.

In the field of economics, the basic task for 1957 was to compile and organize historical materials on the emergence, development, transformation, and elimination of capitalist industry and commerce and the bourgeoisie in Guangdong Province, with a focus on the changes and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce since liberation, in order to further summarize the experiences of the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Guangdong Province and to carry out theoretical research. In 1957, approximately 2,000 pieces of relevant materials on the cigarette industry were collected, and approximately 10,000 thematic cards were marked. The material collection work has now come to an end, and the outline of the report has also been basically completed. In 1958, after the investigation report on the socialist transformation of the cigarette industry is compiled, preparations will be made to continue collecting and organizing materials on the socialist transformation of the match industry and the textile industry.

In the field of history, last year, the collection of materials on the Hailufeng Peasant Movement and the investigation of the development history of Foshan handicrafts were carried out, and the following were compiled: 1. Investigation report on the struggle of the people of Zhanjiang, Guangdong against the French in 1898-1899; 2. Materials report on the development history of Foshan handicrafts; 3. Documentary materials report on the Guangzhou Commune. This year, it is planned to interview veteran revolutionaries from both the old democratic revolution and the new democratic revolution periods; at the same time, the investigation of the Hailufeng Peasant Movement will continue, and historical materials on the revolutionary struggles of the people of Guangdong Province during the two Opium Wars will be collected.

In the field of ethnology, last year, the researchers of the institute participated in the social history survey group of ethnic minorities in Guangdong organized by the National People's Congress and the Ethnic Affairs Commission, and went to mountainous areas to investigate the social history of the Li and Yao ethnic groups. Approximately one million words of comprehensive materials of the Li ethnic group and approximately 500,000 to 600,000 words of comprehensive materials of the Yao ethnic group have now been compiled. This year, the investigation of the social history of the Li ethnic group will continue.
