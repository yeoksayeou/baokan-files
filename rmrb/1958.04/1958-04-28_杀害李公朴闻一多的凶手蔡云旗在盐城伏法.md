Xinhua News Agency, Yancheng, 26th—The case of the counter-revolutionary Cai Yunqi, who murdered the two martyrs Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, has been retried by the Intermediate People's Court of Yancheng District, Jiangsu Province. This afternoon, the criminal Cai was executed by firing squad in Yancheng County.
	Cai Yunqi served as a platoon, company, and battalion commander in the Kuomintang army, as well as a major regimental adjutant and liaison staff officer. He was a heinous secret agent. In 1946, while serving as the intelligence team leader of the Kuomintang's 2nd Reserve Division in Kunming, Yunnan, he resolutely undermined the democratic movement and actively conspired with Kuomintang intelligence captain and secret service chief Chen Guohua and others to murder patriotic democratic figures Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo. In July of the same year, Cai Yunqi served as the leader of the action group organized by the Kuomintang secret service, with the purpose of murdering Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, and others. On the afternoon of July 11, Cai Yunqi directed secret agents to open fire and kill martyr Li Gongpu. On July 15th of the same month, Cai Yunqi led secret agents to reconnoiter the actions of Wen Yiduo, who was presiding over the memorial meeting for martyr Li Gongpu, and then deployed secret agents to lie in ambush outside the venue. After the meeting, when Wen Yiduo was traveling to Xicangpo in Kunming, he was shot and killed by secret agents under Cai Yunqi's command.
