Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 24th: The United States Department of Labor announced on the 23rd that the US cost of living index had risen to an unprecedented high in March. The index for this month was 123.3, an increase of 3.7 over a year ago and 23.3% over the 1947-1949 level.

According to the Department of Labor's economists, the rise in the cost of living index in March was mainly due to rising food prices. These economists pointed out that although the United States is currently in an "economic recession" with unemployment at its highest level in more than a decade, food prices continue to rise unabated.

Including March, the US cost of living index has risen for nearly nineteen consecutive months, which has further deepened the difficulties in the lives of the working people. According to the April issue of "Economic Review," citing statistics from the Heller Committee, which specializes in compiling family budgets, due to rising prices, an American wage-earning family would have to spend $5,830 a year, or $112 a week, to live a decent life, which is almost 4% higher than in 1956. However, the average income of American factory workers last year was only $4,284, or $82.39 a week.

    物价连涨十九个月
    美生活费用爬上新高峰
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国劳工部23日宣布，美国生活费用指数在3月份又上升到前所未有的最高峰。这一个月的指数是123.3，比一年前上涨了3.7，比1947—1949年的水平上涨了23.3％。
    据劳工部的经济学家说，3月份生活费用指数的上升主要是由于粮食价格的上涨。这些经济学家指出，虽然美国目前陷于“经济衰退”，失业人数达到十多年来的最高峰，但是粮食价格仍然有增无已。
    连同3月份在内，美国生活费用指数已经连续上升了差不多十九个月，这种情况进一步加深了劳动人民的生活困难。据4月份的“经济评论”引用专门编制家庭预算的海勒委员会的统计说，由于物价上涨，美国一个靠工资生活的家庭在过去一年中如果要过一种过得去的生活的话，每年得花五千八百三十美元，或者每周一百一十二美元，比1956年差不多高4％。然而美国工厂工人去年的收入平均只有四千二百八十四美元，或者每周只有八十二点三九美元。
