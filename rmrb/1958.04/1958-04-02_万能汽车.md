    The Versatile Automobile
    The "Gong Nong" (Worker-Peasant) versatile agricultural automobile was recently manufactured at the Shenyang Automobile Assembly Plant.
    This is a highly versatile 26-horsepower automobile. In addition to its own cargo load, it can pull an additional 2.5 tons of goods when coupled with a trailer or a general large cart.
    This automobile can replace tractors in dozens of agricultural operations such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting, as well as threshing, milling rice, chopping straw, and logging. It can also be used as a power machine for pumping water for irrigation and drainage, and can even be used to generate electricity. (Xinhua News Agency)

    万能汽车
    “工农牌”万能农业汽车最近在沈阳汽车装配厂制成。
    这是一种通用性很大的二十六马力汽车。除开自身货载以外，挂上拖车或一般大车能多拉两吨半货。
    这种汽车能代替拖拉机从事耕、耙、播种、喷雾、收割，以及打谷、磨米、铡草、伐木等几十种农业作业。它还能当作抽水灌溉、排涝等动力机械，并且可以用来发电。　（新华社）
