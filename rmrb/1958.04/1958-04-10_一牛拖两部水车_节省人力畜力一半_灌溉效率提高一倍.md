One Ox Pulls Two Waterwheels
    Saving Half of Manpower and Animal Power, Irrigation Efficiency Doubles

    (By our newspaper) Zhejiang Daily News: The Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangkou Township, Fenghua County, recently created a new type of ox-powered waterwheel that allows one ox to pull two waterwheels, doubling the water pumping efficiency.

    Old-fashioned ox-powered waterwheels used one ox to pull one wheel, managed by one person, and could only irrigate 30 mu of land. The Dongfanghong Cooperative had a total of 210 waterwheel setups but only 186 head of cattle, not even enough to assign one head of cattle to each waterwheel. This year, after the cooperative's double-cropping rice area increased from 1,600 mu last year to 3,500 mu, manpower and animal power became even more strained. To alleviate this tension, the cooperative members, with the support of the Jiangkou Township General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, created a new type of ox-powered waterwheel that allows one ox to pull two wheels. This type of waterwheel has two additional ground axles and six ball bearing races compared to the old-style waterwheel, and one chassis can mount two waterwheels. After multiple trials, it was proven that this waterwheel can irrigate 60 mu of land, with the same pulling force as a regular old-style waterwheel (80-90 jin), and the cost of modification is only 26 yuan, which can reduce manpower and cattle power by half, and the number of waterwheel setups can also be reduced by half. If the two waterwheel setups are close together, one person can manage two waterwheel setups with four waterwheels.

    This improved ox-powered waterwheel has received widespread attention from agricultural cooperatives in Yin County and Fenghua County, who have sent people to visit and learn modification techniques. The Yin and Fenghua County Committees of the Chinese Communist Party have organized visits for this purpose, requesting that it be widely promoted throughout the counties and that modifications be started immediately so that it can play a role in this year's spring plowing production.

    In addition, it was reported that after learning from the experience of the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangkou Township, Fenghua County, the Shangzhou Cooperative in Ningfeng Township, Yin County, successfully tested one ox pulling two wheels on the 5th. Due to their further research, the pulling force of one ox pulling two wheels is 20 jin lighter than that of the Dongfanghong Cooperative. (Attached picture)

### 一牛拖两部水车  节省人力畜力一半　灌溉效率提高一倍

    一牛拖两部水车
    节省人力畜力一半　灌溉效率提高一倍
    本报讯　浙江日报消息：奉化江口乡东方红农业社最近创造了一牛拖双车的新式牛力水车，使车水效率提高一倍。
    旧式的牛力水车一牛拖一车，一人管理，只能灌三十亩田。东方红社共有二百一十个车头，只有一百八十六头耕牛，连一头耕牛一个车头还放不齐。今年该社连作稻面积由去年一千六百亩增加到三千五百亩后，人力和牛力更显得紧张。为缓和这种紧张情况，社员们在中共江口乡总支的支持下，创造了一牛拖二车的新式牛力水车。这种水车比旧式水车增加了二根地轴，六个弹子盘，一个车盘可以装上两部水车。经多次试验证明，这种水车能灌六十亩田水，拉力与一般旧式水车相同（八、九十斤），改装成本只要二十六元，能减少一半人力与牛力，车头也可减少一半。如果两个车头距离较近，一个人还能管两个车头四部水车。
    这种改良牛力水车，受到鄞县、奉化两县农业社的普遍重视，纷纷派人去参观学习改装技术。鄞、奉两县的中共县委会为此组织参观，要求在全县普遍推广，立即着手改装，以便在今年春耕生产中发挥作用。
    又讯　鄞县宁锋乡上周社学习奉化江口乡东方红农业社的经验以后，5日已试验一牛拖双车成功。由于他们进一步钻研，一牛拖双车的拉力比东方红社的还要轻二十斤。（附图片）
