Figure Painting Must Also Leap Forward!
　　Pan Jiezhi

　　At the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, several artists were painting a portrait of a model worker. The weather was freezing, but he was bare-chested, carrying a dirt basket, full of vigor. The artists asked him to put on his cotton-padded coat, but he smiled and said, "No need. I work like this even when it's snowing, and I'm still warm!"

　　At the time, I was deeply moved and enlightened: Today, hundreds of millions of working people, under the leadership of the Party in building socialism, are creating unprecedented feats in human history with the heroic spirit of moving mountains and filling seas. They hope to see themselves in paintings, to see their labor and struggle. They have put forward unavoidable and urgent demands to today's painters. From this, I thought of figure painting.

　　From the history of Chinese painting, figure painting developed earliest, and its achievements are also the most glorious. The famous masters of ancient times were all figure painters, as Xie Zhaozhi of the Ming Dynasty said, "Before the Tang Dynasty, there were no famous paintings without stories." (Five Miscellaneous Writings) With stories, there are figures. As the mainstream of Chinese painting, figure painting dominated the art world for nearly two thousand years. We must cherish and inherit this tradition, so that it can serve the people and socialist construction.

　　Chinese figure painting has been in decline for a long time, but the fact that it has changed its desolate and stagnant situation of the past five or six hundred years in just a few short years since the founding of the country is very exciting. Figure painting originally originated from the lives and labor of the people. After entering the palaces and temples, its development was greatly limited. This was the fatal and insurmountable weakness of ancient figure painting. Once it returned to the people and combined with the people's lives and struggles, drawing spring water and strength from it, its road would be infinitely broad.

　　However, figure painting today still lags behind landscape and flower-and-bird painting. The breadth and depth of the people's lives it reflects are not enough, and its artistic techniques are still inferior to the level reached by classical figure painting. Figure painters must catch up quickly. In this era of socialist great leap forward, figure painting must also have a great leap forward. In addition to the efforts of figure painters themselves, it is hoped that more painters will paint figures. Landscape painting is closest to figure painting, and many landscape painters are good at figure painting. Moreover, today, the songs of labor resound throughout the motherland, and there are probably very few empty mountains without people. Flower-and-bird painters can vividly depict flowers, birds, insects, and fish, so why can't they vividly depict people? It was very common for ancient painters to be proficient in several subjects. This is precisely one of our excellent traditions. We hope that painters will work together with one heart to establish a large army of figure painting as soon as possible!

    人物画也要大跃进！
    潘洁兹
    在十三陵水库工地，几位美术家给一位劳动模范画像。天气严寒，但他赤裸着上身，挑着土筐，精神抖擞。美术家请他披上棉袄，他笑笑说：“不用。下雪的日子我也就是这样干活，还热呢！”
    当时我深受感动，而且得到启示：今天亿万劳动人民，在党的领导下建设社会主义，正以移山填海的英雄气概，创造人类历史上从未有过的丰功伟绩。他们希望在绘画中看到自己，看到自己的劳动和斗争。他们给今天的画家们提出了不可回避的迫切的要求，由此，我想到了人物画。
    从我国绘画史上看，人物画发达最早，成就也最辉煌。古代的名家都是人物画家，正如明代谢肇制所说“自唐以前，名画未有无故事者。”（五杂俎）有故事便有人物。人物画作为中国绘画的主流，统治了画坛将近二千年之久。我们必须珍视和继承这个传统，使它来为人民、为社会主义建设服务。
    中国人物画衰微已久，但是，建国短短几年的时间便改变了它五六百年来冷落不振的情况，这是十分令人兴奋的。人物画原是从人民的生活和劳动中产生的，进入宫庭和庙堂之后，它的发展受到了极大的限制，这是古代人物画致命的、不可克服的弱点。当它一旦回到了民间，与人民的生活和斗争相结合，从中汲取泉源和力量，它的道路便无限广阔了。
    但是人物画在今天仍落后于山水、花鸟画，它所反映的人民生活的广度和深度都很不够，艺术技巧比之古典人物画已达到的水平也仍有逊色。人物画家必须急起直追，在这个社会主义大跃进的时代，人物画也要来个大跃进。除了人物画家本身努力之外，还希望有更多的画家来画人物。山水画和人物画最为接近，许多山水画家都善工人物，而且今天祖国各地，到处响彻着劳动的歌声，无人的空山大约也很少了。花鸟画家既能活色生香、为花鸟虫鱼传神写照，又何独不能为人物传神写照呢？古代画家兼擅数科是很普遍的，这正是我们优良传统之一，希望画家们同心合力，尽速地建立起一支人物画大军来！
