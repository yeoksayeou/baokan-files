Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: On the eve of the "May 1st" International Labor Day, Beijing is filled with a festive atmosphere. The newly decorated Tiananmen Gate tower has been hung with large red gauze lanterns. The two-tiered platform and steps of the Monument to the People's Heroes, which stands in the center of the square, were cleaned today. The monument will be unveiled on "May Day." Countless electric lights installed on many tall buildings shine like strings of pearls at night, emitting extraordinary brilliance.

    The capital's working class is using new achievements in production and construction to greet their holiday. Dozens of projects, including the recently started Beijing Plastics Factory and the Eastern Suburbs Heating Network, are under intense construction. After several months of intense efforts by the employees of the Beijing Trolleybus Company, the two trolleybus lines, 17 kilometers in total length, from Chongwenmen to the Zoo and from Chongwenmen to Andingmen, officially opened to traffic this afternoon.

    Millions of people are busily preparing to go to Tiananmen Square on "May Day" to receive the review of the Party and state leaders. Employees of the Tianqiao Department Store have already nailed the targets for a new leap forward onto specially made wooden signs. In government offices, schools, factories, and rural areas, songs are everywhere. People are learning the five songs "Socialism is Good," "Revolutionary People," "Catch Up with England," and others, preparing to sing them joyfully on "May Day." The farmers in the suburbs who plan to participate in the parade have organized their own bands. The teachers and students of Tsinghua University have prepared crosstalk, living newspaper skits, and other programs depicting the achievements of the Two Antis campaign, preparing to perform along the parade route. Many Young Pioneers who are preparing to participate in the parade carried signs with slogans such as "Always Be Ready" and models to Tiananmen Square today for rehearsal.

    In the past few days, under the leadership of the Patriotic Health Campaign Committees at all levels, the people of the city have carried out a three-day sanitation cleanup. (Attached picture)

    “五一”前夕的北京
    据新华社28日讯　“五一”国际劳动节前夕，北京全城洋溢着一片节日的气氛。修饰一新的天安门城楼已经挂起了大红纱灯。耸立在广场中央的人民英雄纪念碑两层月台和台阶今天冲洗干净，这个纪念碑将在“五一”节揭幕。许多高大建筑物上安装的无数盏电灯，入夜像成串的珍珠，放出奇光异彩。
    首都工人阶级用新的生产建设成绩来迎接自己的节日。最近开工的北京塑料厂、东郊热力网等几十项工程正在紧张施工。北京市电车公司的职工经过几个月的紧张突击，从崇文门到动物园和从崇文门到安定门全长十七公里的两路无轨电车，今天下午正式通车。
    千千万万的人都在忙碌地准备“五一”到天安门前去接受党和国家领导人的检阅。天桥百货商场职工已经把再跃进的指标钉在特制的木牌上。在机关、学校、工厂、农村里，到处歌声洋溢，人们都正在学习“社会主义好”、“革命人”、“赶上英国”等五支歌，准备在“五一”节欢唱。各郊区计划参加游行的农民都组织了自己的乐队。清华大学的师生已经排好了相声、活报剧等描写双反运动收获的节目，准备到游行的路上演出。准备参加游行的许多少先队员，今天把“时刻准备着”等字标和模型，抬到天安门广场进行了排练。
    这几天，在各级爱国卫生运动委员会的领导下，全市人民进行了为期三天的卫生扫除。（附图片）
