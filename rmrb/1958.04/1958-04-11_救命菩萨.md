    Savior Bodhisattva
    Under the impact of the economic crisis, American capitalists are trembling with fear day and night. Because they are unable to cope, they turn to idols for help! According to the American "Newsweek", the boss of the Fitzgerald-Kirk Company in Chicago has spotted a good business opportunity amidst the crisis. It has produced a Voodoo idol (this religion is a kind of magic cult popular among black people in the southern United States and the West Indies) to peddle. The company advertises that as long as a nail is put on the idol, the insurance business will flourish. In the picture, a nail has already been placed on the right face of the idol, indicating that an American capitalist has already prayed to it.

    救命菩萨
    在经济危机的冲击下，美国资本家日夜胆战心惊，因为应付乏术，于是向偶像乞灵！根据美国“新闻周刊”消息，芝加哥的费兹拉哲—柯克公司的老板看准了一项危机声中的好生意，它制出了一种伏都教偶像（这种教是在美国南部和西印度群岛的黑人中流行的一种魔教）向人兜售，这家公司宣传说，只要在偶像上安上一枚钉子，保险买卖兴隆。图片上偶像的右脸已经安上了一枚钉子，表明已经有一个美国资本家向它祷告过了。
