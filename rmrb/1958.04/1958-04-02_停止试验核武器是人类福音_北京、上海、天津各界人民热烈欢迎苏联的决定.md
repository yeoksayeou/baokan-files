Xinhua News Agency, April 1st—People from all walks of life in the capital warmly welcome the Soviet Union's groundbreaking decision to cease nuclear weapons testing, a move that promotes world peace and benefits all mankind.

    Many workers from factories and construction sites were delighted by the Soviet resolution. Workers from the steelmaking team of the foundry workshop at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory held a discussion after getting off work at noon. Liu Guanglu, a model worker and steelmaking team leader, said at the meeting that the Soviet Union's announcement of a unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing is another new initiative in the struggle for peace.

    Chen Fengshan, deputy director of the China-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, said: We farmers warmly support the Soviet Union's move to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing. The United States and Britain should also stop nuclear weapons testing like the Soviet Union. Only in this way can people engage in peaceful labor and build a happy countryside.

    Wang Shizhen, professor of the Department of Biochemistry at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said: The Soviet decision further clearly demonstrates to the people of the world the Soviet Union's firm determination to strive for world peace. Let's see what those war-mongering elements in the imperialist camp have to say now.

    The teachers of Beihai Kindergarten held a discussion during the children's rest time. They expressed their firm support for this great measure taken by the Soviet Union to promote peace and expressed their anger and protest against the United States' plan to conduct nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific in April.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 1st—The resolution passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the unilateral cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing has been warmly welcomed by the eight million people of Shanghai.

    Representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai gave statements to Xinhua News Agency reporters today on this great Soviet resolution. Jin Zhonghua, a well-known peace advocate and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, said that the whole world has seen that the Soviet government has repeatedly taken proactive steps to put forward strong proposals to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France to stop atomic armament and implement universal disarmament. Now, it has further made the decision to unilaterally cease atomic and hydrogen weapon testing first. This just decision will greatly inspire peace-loving people all over the world, especially the people of Asian and Pacific coastal countries. They will more forcefully launch struggles to stop the US government’s nuclear weapons tests, which are about to begin this month in the Pacific. The Soviet decision will put the governments of the United States and Britain to a more serious test in front of the people of the world.

    Hu Lianfang, a female worker from the Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Textile Factory and the mother of seven children, said that in order to prevent children from losing their parents and parents from losing their children, I wholeheartedly support this great Soviet decision. I hope that the working people of the United States, Britain, and other countries will also rise up to support the Soviet decision and force the governments of the United States and Britain to take the same action.

    Zhou Ren, Director of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the Academy, said that the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the most important news in the world this year. It shows the world the Soviet Union's sincerity and determination to maintain peace. This decision also further proves the Soviet Union's power and strength.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 1st—People from all walks of life in Tianjin warmly support the Soviet resolution to cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. Workers, scientists, industrialists, businessmen, and citizens all agree that the Soviet decision is a boon for humanity.

    Guo Yufang, a worker at the jointly owned Zhicheng Printed Iron Can Factory, witnessed the tragedy of the atomic bomb attack on the people of Hiroshima when he was in Hiroshima, Japan. He said: During the Japanese fascist aggression, when I was captured and forced to work in Hiroshima, I witnessed the tragic situation of the atomic bomb attack on the people of Hiroshima. Everywhere I looked there were thousands upon thousands of innocent deaths. He said that the Soviet Union’s great resolution represents the world’s people’s wish for peace, and it proves once again that the Soviet Union is a bulwark of world peace. In order to prevent the tragedies of the past from recurring, we firmly demand that the United States and Britain take the same approach and cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    Yu Aifeng, a famous obstetrics and gynecology expert, expressed her heartfelt gratitude for the Soviet Union's great action to cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons. She said, "When I attended the World Women's Congress in Denmark in 1953, Japanese sisters accused the US imperialists of the disasters brought to them by the atomic bomb. It was truly unbearable to hear. In order to prevent the tragedy of Hiroshima from recurring elsewhere, and to prevent the bodies and minds of women and children around the world from being devastated by atomic and hydrogen bombs, as a mother and medical worker, I ask the United States and Britain to take the same measures."

    Zhang Guofan, a physicist and president of Tianjin University, said: As a scientist, I warmly support this Soviet initiative. This is another major contribution made by the Soviet Union to strive for world peace. This fact eloquently proves that the Soviet Union is sparing no effort to strive for peace. Whether nuclear weapons can truly stop being tested, and even stop being produced and stop being used in the future, depends on the United States and Britain, which possess nuclear weapons. If the United States and Britain have the slightest sincerity to support peace, they should respond to the Soviet initiative and immediately cease nuclear weapons testing. If the United States and Britain continue to take a stubborn attitude, the Soviet Union, in order to safeguard world peace, reserves the freedom to act on this issue, which is fully in line with the interests of the people of the world.

    Wang Guangying, vice chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce who attended the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, said that the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union this time is a great contribution of the Soviet people to world peace, and also a strong protest against the imperialist countries' obstruction of the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

    停止试验核武器是人类福音
    北京、上海、天津各界人民热烈欢迎苏联的决定
    据新华社1日讯　首都各界人民热烈欢迎苏联宣布停止核武器试验这一促进世界和平、造福全人类的创举。
    很多工厂建筑工地的职工对苏联的这一决议感到欢欣鼓舞。长辛店机车车辆修理工厂翻砂车间炼钢小组的工人，中午下班后举行了座谈会，市劳动模范、炼钢工长刘广禄在座谈会上说，苏联宣布单方面停止核武器试验，是争取和平的又一个新的创举。
    北京郊区中苏友好农业生产合作社副主任陈凤山说：我们农民热烈拥护苏联单方面停止核武器试验的举动，美、英两国也应该和苏联一样停止核武器试验。只有这样，人们才能进行和平的劳动，建设幸福的农村。
    中国医学科学院生物化学系教授王世真说：苏联这一决定，进一步鲜明地向全世界人民证明了苏联坚定不移地为世界和平而奋斗的决心，看帝国主义阵营中的那些战争狂热分子还有什么话好说。
    北海幼儿园的教师们在孩子们的休息时间举行了座谈会，她们表示坚决拥护苏联为促进和平所采取的这项伟大措施，并对美国4月间要在太平洋进行核武器试验表示愤怒和抗议。
    据新华社上海1日电　苏联最高苏维埃会议通过的关于苏联单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验的决议，受到上海八百万人民的热烈欢迎。
    上海市各界代表人士今天向新华社记者就苏联的这一伟大决议发表了谈话。著名和平人士、上海市副市长金仲华说，全世界都看到，苏联政府一再采取主动步骤，向美、英、法等国政府提出停止原子备战、实行普遍裁军的有力建议。现在又进一步作出了首先单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验的决定。这一正义的决定将大大鼓舞全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国人民，他们将更有力地展开斗争，制止美国政府从本月起即将在太平洋上进行的核武器试验。苏联这一决定将使美英等国政府在全世界人民面前受到更严重的考验。
    上海第十七棉纺织厂女工、七个孩子的母亲胡连芳说，为了孩子不失去父母、父母不失去子女，我全心全意拥护苏联的这一伟大决定，希望美、英等国的劳动人民也起来支持苏联的这个决定，迫使美英等国政府也采取同样的行动。
    中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所所长、科学院学部委员周仁说，苏联最高苏维埃会议的决定，是今年世界上最重大的新闻。它向全世界显示了苏联维护和平的诚意和决心。这一决定也更加证明了苏联的强大有力。
    据新华社天津1日电　天津市各界人民热烈拥护苏联停止试验原子武器和氢武器的决议。工人、科学家、工商业者和市民们一致认为，苏联的这一决议是人类的福音。
    公私合营志成印铁制罐厂工人郭玉芳曾在日本广岛目睹广岛人民遭受原子弹袭击的惨状。他说：在日本法西斯侵略时期，我被抓到广岛作苦工时，亲眼看到广岛人民遭受原子弹袭击的悲惨情况，看到到处是成千上万的无辜死亡者。他说，苏联的这个伟大的决议，代表了全世界人民热爱和平的心愿，它再一次证明了苏联是保卫世界和平的堡垒。为了不让过去的悲剧重演，我们坚决要求美、英两国也采取同样的作法，停止试验原子武器和氢武器。
    著名的妇产科专家俞霭峰对苏联决议停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器的伟大行动表示衷心的感谢。她说，我出席1953年在丹麦召开的世界妇女大会时，日本姐妹向大会控诉美帝国主义投原子弹给她们带来的灾害，真是惨不忍闻。为了使广岛的惨剧不再在别的地方重演，为了使全世界妇女儿童的身心不再遭受原子弹和氢弹的摧残，作为一个母亲和医务工作者，我要求美国和英国也采取同样的措施。
    物理学家、天津大学校长张国藩说：作为一个科学家，我热烈拥护苏联这一创举。这是苏联为争取世界和平所作的又一重大贡献。这件事实雄辩地证明：苏联对争取和平是不遗余力的。今后核武器是否能真正停止试验以至停止生产和停止使用，就要看拥有核武器的美英两国了。美、英两国若有丝毫拥护和平的诚意，就应该响应苏联的倡议，立即停止核武器试验。如果美英继续采取顽固态度，苏联为了维护世界和平，在这个问题上保留自由行动，是完全符合全世界人民的利益的。
    曾经出席亚非人民团结大会的天津市工商业联合会副主任委员王光英说，这次苏联最高苏维埃会议的决定是苏联人民对世界和平的伟大贡献，同时也是对帝国主义国家阻挠停止核武器试验的有力抗议。
