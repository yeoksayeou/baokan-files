    Xinghua's Duotian (Raised Field)
    The duotian in Xinghua County are a type of field built by local farmers on low-lying land by digging up soil and dividing it into blocks (or sections). Duotian are similar to the ridged fields built in some flood-prone areas in the north. Duotian have the function of resisting drought and flood. When there is a lot of water, because they are much higher than the water surface, they are not harmed by flooding; in times of drought, because there is water underneath, water can be drawn for irrigation. The low-lying water accumulation between one duotian and another can produce a large amount of silt with a certain fertilizer effect every year. This is another benefit of using this method.

    兴化的垛田
    兴化县的垛田，是当地农民在低洼的地上掘土分块（或分片）筑成的一种田。垛田类似北方一些易涝地区修筑的沟洫台田。垛田具有抗御旱涝的作用。水多的时候，由于它高出水面很多，不受水害；干旱的时候，由于它的下面有水可以提水灌溉。一块垛田与另一块垛之间的低洼积水部分，每年可产生大量具有一定肥效的淤泥。这也是采用这一方法的另一好处。
