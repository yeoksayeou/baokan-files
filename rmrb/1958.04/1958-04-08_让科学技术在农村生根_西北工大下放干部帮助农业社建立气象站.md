    Let Science and Technology Take Root in the Countryside
    Northwest Polytechnic University Cadres Assigned to Lower Levels Help Agricultural Cooperative Establish Weather Station
    (Our Dispatch) Cadres from Northwest Polytechnic University assigned to the Beichitou Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an are determined to let science and technology take root in the countryside. To meet the needs of the great leap forward in agricultural production, they helped the cooperative establish an agricultural weather station, the first agricultural cooperative in Shaanxi Province to have a weather station.
    In the course of labor, they deeply felt that the establishment of an agricultural weather station is not only related to the growth of crops and many other agricultural activities, but also a good tool for popularizing science and technology. Therefore, under the leadership of Associate Professor Xu Zijun, a member of the Science Popularization Association, and with the help of the Shaanxi Provincial Science Popularization Association, they brought into play the revolutionary spirit of serving the peasant masses, and built the agricultural weather station after three days of hard work. At the same time, they adhered to the principle of "spending less money, doing more things, and not spending the cooperative's money."
    Lacking meteorological equipment, they contacted the Shaanxi Provincial Meteorological Bureau and tried to use materials discarded by the Meteorological Bureau for installation; lacking thermometers, they used old thermometers from Northwest Polytechnic University for repair and replacement. Now they have helped the agricultural cooperative train two junior high school graduates who have returned to their hometowns to work as observers at the weather station. (Attached picture)
    This is the weather station established by Northwest Polytechnic University cadres to help the agricultural cooperative.

### 让科学技术在农村生根  西北工大下放干部帮助农业社建立气象站

    让科学技术在农村生根
    西北工大下放干部帮助农业社建立气象站
    本报讯　西北工业大学下放到西安市郊北池头农业社的干部，决心让科学技术在农村生根。他们为适应农业生产大跃进的需要，帮助该社建立了农业气象站；它是陕西省第一个有气象站的农业社。
    他们在劳动过程中，深感到建立农业气象站不仅关系着农作物的生长和其他许多农事活动，同时它也是普及科学技术的一个好工具。于是他们在科普协会会员徐子骏副教授的带领和陕西省科普协会的帮助下，发挥了为农民群众服务的革命干劲，经过三天的坚苦劳动建成了农业气象站。同时他们坚持了“少花钱、多办事、不花社里钱”的原则。
    没有气象器材，他们就同陕西省气象局联系，设法利用气象局报废的材料进行安装；没有温度计，就利用西北工业大学的旧温度计修理代用。现在他们已经帮助农业社培养了回乡生产的两名初中毕业生担任气象站的观测工作。（附图片）
