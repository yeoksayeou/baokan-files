A new variety of double-wheel double-share plow, the double-layer double-share plow, has recently appeared in Henan, further increasing its effectiveness. Similar events are constantly occurring in various provinces and regions, and the confidence of the broad masses of farmers in the double-wheel double-share plow is also growing. This is an unprecedentedly good phenomenon.

The promotion of the double-wheel double-share plow in our country has gradually unfolded with the agricultural cooperativization movement. As early as 1950 and 1953, pilot promotions began in Northeast and North China, with a total of 40,000 units promoted by the end of 1954. By 1955, it entered a stage of large-scale promotion, and trials were also conducted in the paddy fields of the South. Due to the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement in 1955 and 1956, more than 1.5 million units were promoted in these two years alone. This created a good start for the technological revolution in our agricultural production. However, a gust of ill wind in the second half of 1956 and the first half of 1957 damaged the reputation of the double-wheel double-share plow. It was said that "the promotion of the double-wheel double-share plow was messed up," "it was forced to go into the water when it couldn't, and forced to go up the mountain when it couldn't." "One cow couldn't pull it, and two cows just fought." It was even scolded as "killing the cow, burying the person," with a total of "nine deaths" and "ten bad things," which greatly affected the promotion work. Not only did the southern paddy field areas not dare to actively adopt it, but many dry farming areas in the northern plains also stopped vigorously promoting it. As a result, only 72,000 units were promoted nationwide in 1957, with more than 800,000 units stockpiled. Some areas even blindly returned and destroyed plows, causing great losses to the country.

Is the double-wheel double-share plow usable after all? Now, according to the facts in various regions, it is not only usable, but also has shown four major advantages in several years of production practice.

The first advantage of the double-wheel double-share plow is that it can increase production. The double-share plow plows deeper than the old plow, has a flatter plow bottom, turns the soil better, and covers the grass tightly. This promotes crop root development, allows fertilizer to be more effective, stores more moisture, and makes the plants more vigorous. Especially when the old plow cannot plow in dry and hard soil, the double-share plow can resist drought and cultivate. Therefore, regardless of whether it is in the North or South, dry land or paddy field, in comparative tests in 24 provinces (regions) across the country, 18 crops, including rice, wheat, barley, buckwheat, corn, millet, sorghum, soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, cotton, flax, potatoes, broad beans, radishes, and sugar beets, have all significantly increased production. Many examples reflected in the recent Southern Double-Share Plow Conference showed that the minimum increase was 5%, and the general increase was 30% to 40%. Because the increase in production is so significant, all regions that have used it have made the promotion and use of double-share plows one of the main measures to achieve the grain and cotton production targets of the Agricultural Development Program.

The second advantage of the double-wheel double-share plow is that it has high work efficiency and saves labor and animal power. Practice in various places has proven that the double-share plow can save half of the cattle labor and two-thirds to three-quarters of the human labor compared to the old plow. A double-share plow, if used properly, can be equivalent to four old-style plows. During the winter sowing last year, the Liaoyuan Cooperative in Chuxian County, Anhui Province, saved 27,892 labor days, accounting for 18.26% of the total labor days of the year, due to the large-scale use of double-share plows and other new agricultural tools. The Dongguapu Agricultural Cooperative in Guangdong Province used double-share plows to harvest 900 mu of peanuts, saving 675 man-days and 250 cattle-days. Zhejiang Province conducted comparative tests of work efficiency at ten locations, and in all cases, one double-share plow plowed more than two old plows. The manpower and cattle power saved by using double-share plows can be used for other tasks, which not only increases income and solves the difficulty of insufficient labor and livestock after cooperativization, but also can seize the season, complete the planting tasks in advance, expand the area of multiple cropping, and ensure that agricultural time is not violated, which is conducive to increased production and bumper harvests.

The third advantage of the double-wheel double-share plow is that it reduces labor intensity and improves labor utilization. The double-share plow does not require manual operation, and women and semi-able-bodied laborers can use it. Some can even plow the fields while carrying rice straw to nearby fields. Fang Wenxin, a female double-share plow operator in Longyou County, Zhejiang Province, can operate two plows to plow the fields by herself. Farmers in Jiangkou County, Guizhou, have such a song praising the double-share plow: Two cows pull the plow as fast as the wind, double shares turn the soil as fast as a dragon, who says new farm tools are heavy, the girl's face doesn't blush. This can not only improve the utilization rate of labor, but also help increase production. Secondly, using a double-share plow can also learn the techniques of adjusting depth and width, as well as disassembly and maintenance. Having this preliminary preparation for mechanical operation technology creates conditions for realizing agricultural mechanization in the shortest possible time.

The fourth advantage of the double-wheel double-share plow is that it can promote the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives. The double-share plow is the public property of the agricultural cooperative, which can increase production and increase income, and naturally becomes the material basis for promoting the consolidation and development of the agricultural cooperative. After agricultural cooperativization, there is a new production relationship adapted to advanced production tools, which can uniformly allocate cattle and connect small plots of land into large areas, making it easier to use double-share plows for cultivation. At the same time, it will promote the consolidation and development of agricultural cooperatives. This is a role that cannot be ignored.

Since the advantages of the double-share plow have been proven by the above-mentioned facts, why do some people insist on attacking the double-share plow, even affecting its promotion and use, and even causing the abnormal phenomenon of returning and destroying plows? Now, the main purpose of discussing this issue is to draw some lessons and establish correct ideological methods among cadres more universally. In the past, the double-wheel double-share plow was attacked and could not be promoted for many reasons. When the individual private ownership of the means of production was changed to collective public ownership, and when the double-wheel double-share plow was promoted to replace the old plow and consolidate collective public ownership, the resistance of some wealthy farmers to socialism, as well as the conservative thinking and habits of the peasants, were reflected in the minds of some rural work cadres, and they did not like the double-share plow. In addition, the rightists stirred up trouble, which once formed a counter-current against the double-share plow. Some cadres in the business departments themselves also had right-leaning conservative ideas, or lacked revolutionary vigor and courage, or were unprepared, so they "did not stand firm against" the small typhoon and the counter-rash advance trend, thus forming a chaotic situation of retreat and stagnation. These cadres had not participated in agricultural production and had not personally experienced the benefits of the double-share plow in practice. They did not understand that even a small improvement in production tools could significantly increase the yield of crops. They did not understand that changing the wooden plow to an iron plow was a major revolution in agricultural production. As soon as they saw that the double-share plow was not working well in the experiment, or that it was not being used, they talked a lot and gossiped. They were picky about the double-share plow, and believed that the successful examples were individual cases and could not be generally promoted. This is the main reason why the double-share plow could not be promoted.

Of course, there were indeed some shortcomings in the promotion work in the past, such as insufficient technical training, untimely supply, and a failure to keep up with parts and repairs, which did affect the promotion and use of the double-share plow. But these can be overcome in practical work. Many areas have greatly demonstrated the advantages of the double-share plow and have won a high evaluation of the double-share plow among farmers because the leaders attach importance to it, thoroughly overcome the right-leaning conservative ideology, take the initiative to make typical examples, conduct on-site demonstrations, actively promote it, and earnestly do a series of practical work such as technical teaching, repair, and maintenance. For example, farmers in Huangyan County, Zhejiang, call it "production-increasing plow," and farmers in Jiashan County call it "benefit-creating plow." After immigrants in Shantou, Guangdong, moved to Hainan Island, they used hoes to dig the land, which was very laborious and inefficient. After they got the double-share plow, the labor intensity was greatly reduced and the work efficiency was greatly improved. They call it "life-saving plow." In the dry farming areas of the northern plains and in more farmers across the country, they have used it, are familiar with it, and have established a deep relationship with it, and more figuratively call it a "small tractor." After several years of testing and use in various places, it has been proved that it can be used in dry farming and paddy field areas in the plains and in flat areas in mountainous areas, except for a few steep terraced fields and muddy fields that are too deep, and it has played a significant role in increasing production in production. Of course, the double-share plow is not perfect and does not need to be further researched and improved; nor is it that all cultivated land in the country can be plowed with double-share plows. We must also actively conduct research and improvement, and carefully test its regional adaptability in different regions to meet the needs of local agricultural production. But the question is whether to take a proactive attitude.

The double-wheel double-share plow is a major good agricultural tool in the current agricultural production, especially in the case of a great leap forward in agricultural production, it has its special superior role. In the future, it should continue to be promoted on a large scale in a wider range of areas to give full play to its huge role in agricultural production, increase the production of more grain and cotton for the country, and transition from semi-mechanization to mechanization. We must cherish the double-share plow with great enthusiasm, widely publicize the deep plowing and production-increasing effect of the double-share plow and the advantages of saving labor, and generally introduce the methods to solve the specific problems arising in use. Rural work cadres in various places should actively promote the double-share plow according to the local promotion plan. Everyone must be a promoter, and everyone will use the double-share plow, so that every double-share plow can be put into production. Let us make a great leap forward in the promotion and use of double-wheel double-share plows in this year's great leap forward in agricultural production.

### 提高双轮双铧犁的效用

    提高双轮双铧犁的效用
    最近河南出现了双轮双铧犁的新品种——双层双铧犁，效力更加提高。类似的事实在各个省区也不断出现，广大农民群众对于双轮双铧犁的信心也越来越高。这是空前的好现象。
    双轮双铧犁在我国的推广，是随着农业合作化运动逐步开展的。早在1950年和1953年，先后在东北和华北地区开始试验推广，1954年底共推广了四万部。到1955年即进入大量推广阶段，同时又在南方水田地区进行了试验。1955年和1956年由于农业合作化运动高潮的到来，两年就推广了一百五十多万部。这是推广工作的一个大跃进。这给我国农业生产上的技术革命，创造了良好的开端。但是，1956年下半年和1957年上半年有一阵子歪风，破坏了双轮双铧犁的名誉。说什么“双轮双铧犁的推广搞糟了”，“不能下水硬叫它下水，不能上山硬叫它上山”。“一头牛拉不动，两头牛光打架”。还骂它：“拉死牛，抬死人”，共有“九死”“十不好”等等，以致推广工作大受影响。不光在南方水田地区不敢积极采用，连北方平原的不少旱作地区也不再大力推广。结果1957年全国仅推广七万二千部，积压八十多万部。有的地区甚至盲目退犁毁犁，给国家造成很大损失。
    双轮双铧犁到底能用不能用呢？现在根据各个地区的事实证明，不仅能用，而且在几年来的生产实践中显示了四大优越性。
    双轮双铧犁的第一个优越性是能够增产。双铧犁比旧犁耕得深、犁底平、翻土好、盖草严，作物根系发育，能发挥肥效，多蓄水分，植株旺盛，特别在天旱地硬旧犁不能耕的时候，双铧犁能抗旱耕种。因此，不论北方和南方，旱地和水田，在全国二十四个省（区）的对比试验，有水稻、小麦、大麦、荞麦、玉米、谷子、高粱、大豆、花生、芝麻、油菜籽、棉花、亚麻、马铃薯、蚕豆、萝卜、甜菜等十八种作物都显著增产。最近在南方双铧犁会议上所反映的很多例子，最少的增产5％，一般的增产30％到40％。由于增产这样显著，凡是使用起来的地区，都把推广使用双铧犁作为实现农业发展纲要粮棉生产指标的主要措施之一。
    双轮双铧犁的第二个优越性，是工作效率高，节省劳力和畜力。各地实践证明，双铧犁比旧犁可以节省一半牛工、三分之二到四分之三的人工。一部双铧犁，会用的可抵得住四部旧式犁。安徽滁县燎原一社去年冬播时，由于大量使用了双铧犁和其他新式农具，节省了二万七千八百九十二个劳动日，占全年劳动日的18.26％。广东省东瓜铺农业社用双铧犁收花生九百亩，节省六百七十五个人工，二百五十个牛工。浙江省在十个点上做了工作效率对比试验，都是一部双铧犁比两部旧犁耕得还要多。用双铧犁节省的人力和牛力再去做其他活计，不但能增加收入和解决合作化后劳畜力不足的困难，而且还能抢季节，提前完成耕种任务，扩大复种面积，保证不违农时，有利于增产丰收。
    双轮双铧犁的第三个优越性，是减轻劳动强度，提高劳动利用率。双铧犁耕地不用手扶，妇女和半劳力都能使用。有的还可以一面耕田，一面向邻近田里抱运稻草。浙江省龙游县女双铧犁手方文新一个人可以操纵两部犁耕田。贵州江口县农民对双铧犁有这样的歌颂：两牛拉犁急如风，双铧翻土快如龙，谁说新式农具重，姑娘支起脸不红。这既能提高劳动力的利用率，也有利于增加生产。其次是使用双铧犁，还能学会调节深浅宽窄和拆装保养等技术，有了这种机械操作技术的初步准备，就给在尽可能短的时间内实现农业机械化创造了条件。
    双轮双铧犁的第四个优越性，是能够促进农业生产合作社的巩固和发展。双铧犁是农业社的公共财产，既能增加生产，增加收入，自然就成为促进农业社巩固发展的物质基础。农业合作化后有了适应先进生产工具的新的生产关系，就可以统一调配耕牛，把小片土地连成大片，更便于使用双铧犁耕作，同时又会促进农业社的巩固和发展。这是一个不容忽视的作用。
    双铧犁的优越性，既有上述的事实来证明，那末，为什么有些人硬是要来攻击双铧犁，直至影响它的推广使用，甚至造成退犁毁犁的反常现象呢？现在来讲这个问题主要是从中吸取一些经验教训，更普遍地在干部中建立正确的思想方法。过去对双轮双铧犁受到攻击，不能推广，原因是多方面的。当生产资料的个体私有制改变为集体公有制的时候，当推广双轮双铧犁来代替旧犁并巩固集体公有制的时候，一些富裕农民对社会主义的抵触情绪及农民保守思想和习惯势力的一面，就在某些农村工作干部的思想上反映出来，他们对双铧犁不怀好感。再加上右派分子们从中兴风作浪，就一度形成了反对双铧犁的一股逆流。业务部门本身也有一部分干部存在着右倾保守思想，或者缺乏革命的朝气和勇气，或者是心中无数，因而在小台风和反冒进的逆流中“没有硬着头皮顶住”，从而形成了退缩不前的混乱局面。这些干部没有参加过农业生产，没有从实践中亲身体会到双铧犁的好处，不懂得生产工具任何微小的改进，都能使农作物的产量显著地增加。他们不了解将木犁改为铁犁就是农业生产上一个很大的革命。他们一看到双铧犁试验不好，或没有使用起来，就议论纷纷，说长道短。他们对双铧犁却吹毛求疵，对使用成功的典型，认为是个别的例子，不能作一般推广。这是双铧犁不能推广的主要原因。
    当然，过去在推广工作中也的确存在着一些缺点，如技术训练的不透，供应有的不及时，零件和修配跟不上等，确实影响了双铧犁的推广和使用。但这些是能够在实际工作中加以克服的。有不少地区由于领导重视，彻底克服了右倾保守思想，并亲自动手，做出典型，现场示范，积极推广，切实地做好技术传授、修理、保养等一系列的实际工作，因而大大显示了双铧犁的优越性，使双铧犁在农民中获得了很高的评价。如浙江黄岩县的农民叫它作“增产犁”，嘉善县的农民称它为“造福犁”，广东汕头的移民到海南岛后，用锄头刨地，费力很大，效率很低，得到双铧犁后，劳动强度大大减轻，工作效率大大提高，他们把它叫做“救命犁”。在北方平原旱作地区及全国各地更众多的农民，由于使用它，熟悉它，和它建立了深厚的感情，更形象地说它是“小拖拉机”。几年来经过各地试验使用证明，除少数陡坡梯田和泥脚过深的烂泥田以外，在平原旱作和水田地区及山区的平坦地带，都能使用，并在生产中发挥了显著的增产作用。当然，双铧犁并不是已经完美无缺，不必再研究改进；也不是全国所有耕地，一律都能用双铧犁耕。我们还要积极地进行研究和改进，并在不同地区认真地试验它的地区适应性，以符合当地农业生产的需要。但是问题在于是否采取积极的态度。
    双轮双铧犁是当前农业生产上一件主要的好农具，尤其在农业生产大跃进的情况下，更有它特殊的优越作用。今后要在更广泛的地区继续大量推广，以充分发挥它在农业生产中的巨大作用，为国家增产更多的粮棉，并从半机械化进一步过渡到机械化。我们要以极大的热情爱护双铧犁，广泛宣传双铧犁深耕增产的效用和省工省力的优点，普遍介绍解决使用中所产生的具体问题的办法。各地广大农村工作干部都要根据当地推广计划，积极地大力推广双铧犁。一定要人人都做促进派，个个会用双铧犁，让每部双铧犁都投入生产。让我们在今年农业生产的大跃进中使双轮双铧犁的推广和使用，也来一个大跃进。
