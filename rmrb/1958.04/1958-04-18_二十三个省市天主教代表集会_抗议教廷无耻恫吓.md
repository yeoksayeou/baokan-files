Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, April 17th: Eighty-two clergy and Catholic believers, representing twenty provinces, one autonomous region, and two municipalities across the country, who came to Wuhan to attend the "ordination" ceremonies of the newly elected bishops of the Hankou and Wuchang dioceses, gathered today to protest the Roman Curia's shameless intimidation of the self-elected bishops of the Hankou and Wuchang dioceses.

The assembly unanimously passed a protest letter stating: We cheer for the Chinese Catholic Church embarking on the path of independence and self-governance, and for the Hankou Archdiocese and Wuchang Diocese independently electing bishops and independently "ordaining" bishops. The protest letter said that the Hankou and Wuchang dioceses' self-election of bishops and self-conducting of "ordination" ceremonies for bishops in order to safeguard the independence and dignity of the motherland and to break away from the reactionary rule of the Roman Curia for the benefit of the Church is a just action, in line with the traditional spirit of the Church, and expresses full support for this.

The protest letter used historical facts to expose the Roman Curia's consistent stance of being hostile to the Chinese people. The Roman Curia used Chinese Catholicism as a tool for imperialist aggression, conducting espionage activities in China. During the Japanese imperialist invasion of China and during World War II, the Roman Curia was an accomplice of the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists. The Roman Curia also used religious means to persecute and attack righteous patriotic priests and believers in China, even forcing them to oppose their own motherland with reactionary "encyclicals" and "orders," while praising counter-revolutionaries within the Church. This fully proves that the Roman Curia has completely abandoned fairness and justice.

The protest letter said that the current relationship between Chinese Catholicism and the Roman Curia is a matter of two fundamentally opposed political positions, a matter of enemy versus friend. Chinese priests and believers must maintain the purity of the Church, love the socialist New China led by the Communist Party, completely break away from the reactionary rule of the Roman Curia, and resolutely take the path of independence and self-governance.

The protest letter pointed out that self-election of bishops and self-conducting of "ordination" ceremonies is the inherent right of Chinese priests and believers. Since the Chinese Catholic Representatives Conference made the resolution on independent and self-governed church last year, many dioceses have elected their own bishops. The protest letter expressed its deep belief that following the righteous actions of the Hankou and Wuchang dioceses in "self-election and ordination" of bishops, this will blossom and bear fruit in dioceses across the country, achieving a comprehensive victory.

The protest letter reiterated that the determination of the Chinese Catholic clergy and believers to support the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, love the socialist motherland, and take the path of independent and self-governed church is unstoppable by any force. The protest letter reminded Chinese patriotic believers: The Roman Curia will not be reconciled to its failure, and we must be vigilant against the Roman Curia's use of brutal, unreasonable or hypocritical and shameless tricks, and not be fooled by it.

### 二十三个省市天主教代表集会  抗议教廷无耻恫吓

    二十三个省市天主教代表集会
    抗议教廷无耻恫吓
    新华社汉口17日电　来武汉参加汉口、武昌两个教区两位新选主教“祝圣”典礼的全国二十个省、一个自治区、两个市的天主教代表共八十二位神职人员和天主教徒，今天集会抗议罗马教廷对汉口、武昌两教区自选主教的无耻恫吓。
    大会一致通过一项抗议书说：我们为中国天主教走上了独立自主自办教会的道路，为汉口总主教区和武昌教区自己选举主教和自己“祝圣”主教而欢呼。抗议书说，汉口、武昌两教区为维护祖国独立尊严、为教会的利益摆脱罗马教廷的反动统治而自己选举主教、自己为主教举行“祝圣”仪式是正义的行动，符合教会的传统精神，对此表示全力支持。
    抗议书以历史事实来揭发了罗马教廷一贯与中国人民为敌的立场，罗马教廷利用中国天主教作为帝国主义的侵略工具，对中国进行间谍活动，在日本帝国主义侵略中国时期和第二次世界大战期间，罗马教廷都是德、意、日法西斯的帮凶。罗马教廷还对中国正义的爱国神长和教徒用宗教手段加以迫害、打击，甚至用反动的“通谕”、“命令”逼着他们去反对自己的祖国，而对教会内的反革命分子却赞扬倍至。这就充分证明罗马教廷完全废弃了公道和正义。
    抗议书说，当前中国天主教与罗马教廷的关系是两个根本对立的政治立场问题，是敌我矛盾问题。中国神长和教徒要维护教会的纯洁、热爱共产党领导的社会主义新中国，彻底摆脱罗马教廷的反动统治，坚决走独立自主自办教会的道路。
    抗议书指出，自己选举主教和自己举行“祝圣”仪式是中国神长和教徒的应有权力。自去年中国天主教友代表会议作出独立自主自办教会的决议以来，许多教区已经选出了自己的主教。抗议书表示深信继汉口、武昌两教区之后，“自选祝圣”主教的义举必将在全国各教区开花结果，获得全面的胜利。
    抗议书重申中国天主教的神长和教徒拥护中国共产党的领导、热爱社会主义祖国和走独立自主自办教会道路的决心是任何力量所阻挡不了的。抗议书提醒中国爱国教徒：罗马教廷不会甘心自己的失败，要警惕罗马教廷实行横蛮无理或伪善无耻的伎俩，不要上它的当。
