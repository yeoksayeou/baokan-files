Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The United States, Britain, and France submitted a reply to the Soviet Union on the 16th, agreeing to begin the preparatory talks for a summit meeting in Moscow on April 17.

At the same time, the Western reply emphasized that there are still significant differences of opinion between the Soviet government and the Western three governments regarding the "nature and scope" of the preparatory talks. The Western reply still maintains that the preparatory diplomatic meeting should discuss substantive issues.

The notes of the Western three countries are in response to the Soviet Union's memorandum of April 11 on the issue of diplomatic preparatory talks.

Prior to this, Dulles had already revealed the content of the Western three countries' reply when answering questions at a press conference on the 15th.

Dulles' words elicited a series of follow-up questions from reporters.

One reporter asked Dulles if his words meant that the United States would not hold this level of meeting otherwise. He replied that he "would not want to say that." Another reporter asked whether the United States would refuse to participate in a summit meeting if the Soviet Union refused to discuss "substantive issues" at the ambassadorial or foreign minister level. Dulles said he was "unwilling to answer that question definitively at this time."

Under the pressure of world opinion's urgent demand for a summit meeting, Dulles, although not daring to openly display the original rigid attitude of the United States on the issue of preparatory talks for the summit meeting, attempted to use issues such as the agenda to delay and obstruct the speedy convening of the summit meeting. He said that the United States did not want the summit meeting to have a "very rigid agenda" that would prevent the United States from raising what it considered to be "extremely important issues." In this regard, he cited Eisenhower's provocative raising of the so-called "situation in Eastern Europe" at the first summit meeting as an example.

    美英法就外交预备会议复照苏联
    同意十七日在莫斯科举行
    但仍主张会议要讨论实质问题
    据新华社讯　美、英、法三国16日向苏联提出一份复照，同意4月17日在莫斯科开始举行最高级会议的外交预备会谈。
    同时，西方的复照强调指出，关于预备会谈的“性质和范围”，在苏联政府和西方三国政府之间，仍然有重大的意见分歧。西方的复照仍然主张外交预备会谈要讨论实质性的问题。
    西方三国的照会是答复苏联4月11日就外交预备会谈问题给它们的备忘录的。
    在这以前，杜勒斯15日在记者招待会上回答问题时，已经透露西方三国复照的内容。
    杜勒斯的话，引起了记者们一连串的追问。
    有记者问杜勒斯，他的话是不是说不然美国就不举行这一级的会议。他回答说，他“不愿意这样说”。有记者又问，如果苏联拒绝在大使级或者外交部长级会议上讨论“实质问题”，美国是不是要拒绝参加最高级会议。杜勒斯说，他“不愿意在目前断然回答这个问题”。
    在世界舆论迫切要求举行最高级会议的压力下，杜勒斯虽然在最高级会议预备会谈的问题上，不敢再公然表现出美国原来的僵硬态度，但是，他又企图利用议程等问题来拖延和阻挠最高级会议迅速召开。他说，美国不希望最高级会议有一个“非常刻板的议程”，使得美国不能提出它认为“极其重要的问题”。在这方面他举出艾森豪威尔在第一次最高级会议上曾经提出所谓“东欧局势”的挑衅性问题作例子。
