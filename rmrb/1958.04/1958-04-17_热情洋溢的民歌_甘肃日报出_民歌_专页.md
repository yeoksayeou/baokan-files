    Enthusiastic Folk Songs
    Gansu Daily Publishes a "Folk Song" Special Page
    (Our Newspaper News) The Gansu Daily published a "Folk Song" special page on April 11th, calling on everyone to collect folk songs. The editors of the special page said: The reason they published these folk songs is "not only for everyone to appreciate and widely circulate them, but more importantly, to arouse everyone's attention to folk songs and encourage everyone to collect them." The folk songs published on the special page are all new works singing about the new life and the Great Leap Forward. The authors of these folk songs are mostly farmers and cadres.
    From these enthusiastic folk songs, one can see the incomparably majestic revolutionary spirit and the incomparably strong revolutionary will of the working people, and the language is simple and vivid. For example, in Ma Shouyi's "Rice Flowers Will Be Sown on the Top of the Mountain": "Such a ground breaking great thing, the Tao River water is going to (go) to the top of the mountain, the canal is going to pass (over) Huajia Ridge, the arid mountain is laughing. Ten thousand zhang high mountains are mountains connected to mountains, the top of the mountain is connected to the blue sky; It's so rare for the Datong River to go up the mountain, the dry land will be transformed into a paddy field. The big red flowers with green branches and green leaves are planted all over the mountains and fields; The water rushing up the mountain is gurgling, and rice flowers will be sown on the top of the mountain." In Guo Kanbu's "Singing Songs While Herding Sheep": "The weather is so cool early in the morning, the sun is blooming red flowers on the hillside; Holding books and iron shovels, I sing songs while herding sheep. I sing and the sheep sing, squeaking and chattering noisily. I sing about the busy production, and the sheep sing about the fragrant grass. The mountain is my good school, I open the book and read articles. What are the sheep bleating about? You can't read, you can only sing."
    The Gansu Daily plans to continue to select and publish some new folk songs in the future, in order to arouse everyone's attention to folk songs. The following is the layout of the "Folk Song" special page of the Gansu Daily on April 11th.

    热情洋溢的民歌
    甘肃日报出“民歌”专页
    本报讯　4月11日甘肃日报出了“民歌”专页，号召大家都来收集民歌。专页的编者说：他们所以发表这些民歌，“其目的固然在于供大家欣赏，广为流传，更重要的是在于引起大家对民歌的重视，人人动手收集。”专页上发表的一批民歌，都是歌唱新生活、歌唱大跃进的新作品。这些民歌的作者大部分是农民和干部。
    从这些热情洋溢的民歌里，可以看出劳动人民无比雄伟的革命气概，无比坚强的革命意志，而且语言朴素生动。如马守义所作的“山顶上要扬个稻花”中有：“开天辟地的大事情，洮河水要上（个）山顶，渠道要过（者）华家岭，干旱山发出了笑声。万丈高山是山连山，山顶子接的是青天；大通河上山是多稀罕，山旱地变成个水田。青枝绿叶的大红花，满山（吧）遍野里种下；大水上山是哗啦啦，山顶上要扬个稻花。”郭堪布所作的“唱着歌儿去牧羊”中有：“清早天气好凉爽，山畔太阳放红花；手拿书本和铁铲，唱着歌儿去牧羊。我也唱来羊也唱，吱吱哇哇闹嚷嚷。我唱的是生产忙，羊儿唱的青草香。山是我的好学堂，打开书本念文章。羊儿咩咩叫什么，你不会念书只会唱。”
    甘肃日报准备以后继续选登一些新的民歌，以引起大家对民歌的重视。下面是4月11日甘肃日报“民歌”专页的版面。
