Post-Editing Notes:

    Learn from Anguo
    In early May, Anguo County will completely eliminate third-class wheat, and second-class wheat will also be greatly reduced. This is an encouraging good news!
    How we long to frequently publish such news! If all major wheat-producing areas across the country could eliminate third-class wheat, this year's total wheat production would greatly increase. Therefore, Anguo County's methods of managing wheat fields are worthy of attention.
    Anguo County is a major wheat-producing county in Hebei Province, and the masses have relatively high wheat field management techniques. This is a favorable condition for managing this year's wheat fields, but it is not the decisive factor. This news tells us that in Anguo County, in the early stages of proposing to strengthen wheat field management, some cadres and the masses also lacked confidence in high-yield fields and increasing the yield of secondary wheat. Only after mass debates were they universally mobilized and found many good ways to manage wheat fields. It can be seen that the establishment of a dedicated leadership front in Anguo County is an important reason for managing wheat fields well.
    Perhaps some people think that "strengthening leadership" is old news and there is nothing new. In fact, this cannot be ambiguous at all. From the experience of Anguo County, we can see how the ideological obstacles of the masses were broken, how measures were grasped, and how the specialized responsibility system was established. All this is first determined by someone to lead. Therefore, if we want to learn from Anguo County's experience in managing wheat fields, the first step should be to truly strengthen leadership.
    Now some areas in the South have already started harvesting wheat, while in the North there is still some time left. In order to strive for increased wheat production, we should seize the opportunity, strengthen leadership, and never relax management work until the wheat harvest. We believe that since Anguo County can eliminate third-class wheat, other regions, as long as they make subjective efforts, will definitely not be an exception.

    向安国看齐
    5月初，安国县将全部消灭三类麦，二类麦也将大大减少。这是一条振奋人心的好消息！
    我们多么渴望经常编发这类消息啊！如果全国各主要麦产区都能消灭三类麦，今年麦子的总产量就会有很大的增加。因此，安国县管理麦田的办法，很值得重视。
    安国县是河北省的主要产麦县，群众有较高的麦田管理技术。这对管理好今年的麦田是一个有利条件，但不是决定性的因素。这条消息告诉我们，在安国县提出加强麦田管理的初期，一部分干部和群众对高额丰产田和提高次麦产量的信心也是不足的，经过群众性的辩论，才普遍动员起来，找到了许多管理麦田的好办法。由此可见，安国县建立专门的领导战线，是管理好麦田的重要原因。
    也许有人认为，“加强领导”是老生常谈，没有什么新鲜。其实，这是一点也含糊不得的。从安国县的经验中可以看出，群众的思想障碍是怎样打破的？措施是怎样抓到的？专责制是怎样建立起来的？这一切首先决定于有人来领导。因此，我们要学习安国县管理麦田的经验，第一步就应该切切实实地加强领导。
    现在南方有的地区已经开始收麦了，在北方则还有一段时间。为了争取小麦增产，我们应该抓紧时机，加强领导，不到麦收绝不放松管理工作。我们相信，安国县既然能够消灭三类麦，其它地区只要经过主观努力也决不会例外。
