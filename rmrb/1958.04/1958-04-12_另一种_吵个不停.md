    Another Kind of "Constant Arguing"
    In the Tongtian Street Office in Harbin’s Xiangfang District, under a dazzling array of big-character posters on a long table, were many red and green paper packages, with names written on them. Li Shouqi, the director of the office, said to visitors: "These are the surplus grains saved by the residents, and they brought them in with gongs and drums." It turned out that 22 households in the Eighth and Ninth Committees of Tongtian Street used to constantly complain about not having enough food before the "Double Anti" campaign, often arguing incessantly at the office. Now, the food ration is still the same, but all 22 households have surpluses. Li Shouqi humorously said: "These people still come to the office to argue constantly. For example, one group beats gongs and drums, while another insists on sending surplus grain to the government. Should we accept it? It's hard to handle. If we don't accept it? That's also difficult! We had to open an exhibition for everyone to visit." Now, housewives in Xiangfang District have created as many as 18 ways to save grain. They say that in order to build socialism, they will never waste a single grain of food.

    另一种“吵个不停”
    哈尔滨市香坊区通天街办事处里，在琳琅满目的大字报底下的长条桌上，摆着许多红绿纸包，纸包上还写着姓名。办事处主任李寿祺向参观的人说：“这是居民们节余的粮食，他们敲锣打鼓送来的。”原来通天街八委、九委有二十二户人家，在双反前老是闹粮食不够吃，经常到办事处吵个不停，现在粮食定量还是那么多，可是二十二户人家户户都有了节余。李寿祺风趣地说：“这些人现在也还是到办事处来吵个不停。比如这个敲锣打鼓，那个硬要往政府送余粮。接受吗，不好处理，不接受吗，也不好办！只好开个展览会，让大家参观。”现在，香坊区的家庭主妇们，已创造出节约粮食的办法十八种之多。她们表示，为了建设社会主义，决不浪费一粒粮食。
