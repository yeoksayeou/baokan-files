Xinhua News Agency, April 29th dispatch from Washington: CIA Director Allen Dulles said on the 28th that Soviet industrial development is poised to surpass the United States. He stated that the current economic crisis in the United States is "a costly luxury" that will damage America's prestige abroad.

Allen Dulles made the speech at the opening banquet of the 46th annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Almost every speaker at the meeting expressed pessimism when discussing the future of the U.S. economy.

Allen Dulles compared the U.S. economy with the Soviet economy. He said that in the first quarter of this year, Soviet industrial production increased by 11% compared to a year ago, while U.S. industrial production decreased by 11%. He said that for the first time in history, the combined steel production of the Soviet Union, Eastern European countries, and China exceeded that of the United States in the first quarter of this year. The steel production of the Soviet Union alone accounted for 75% of that of the United States.

Allen Dulles also said that Soviet coal production is about 70% of that of the United States, and the production of machine tools is about twice as much as that of the United States. He said that, calculated by gross national product, the Soviet economy is growing twice as fast as the U.S. economy.

Republican Senator Bennett said at the banquet that he was "not optimistic or hopeful" about the possibility of a rapid recovery in American business.

Bennett said that in addition to huge military spending and "anti-recession" spending, if tax cuts are added, it may create a deficit of 20 to 24 billion U.S. dollars in the next fourteen months.

The member of the Senate Finance Committee said that the huge expenditure of the federal government will create a deficit of 10 to 12 billion U.S. dollars in the current and next fiscal years. Due to additional expenditures plus tax cuts, the deficit may double.

Bennett said that the United States is facing a situation of "buyer strikes in some areas." In this regard, he specifically mentioned automobiles, which he believes is a "silent resistance" by buyers "to high prices."

The chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Affairs, Democrat George Mahon, said that the United States still lags behind the Soviet Union in the manufacture of intercontinental ballistic missiles. He also said that if the United States implements the military plans that are currently being implemented or planned, the hope of tax cuts will be "dim."

Four thousand delegates attended the annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

    特务头子承认苏联工业发展超过美国
    新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯28日说，苏联的工业发展大有超过美国之势。他说，美国目前的经济危机是“一个代价重大的奢侈品”，它将有损美国在国外的威信。
    艾伦·杜勒斯是在美国商会第四十六届年会开幕宴会上发表演说的。会议上几乎所有的发言在谈到美国经济的前途时都表示悲观。
    艾伦·杜勒斯把美国的经济同苏联的经济作了对比。他说，在今年第一季度，苏联工业生产比一年前增加了11％，而美国的工业生产却下降了11％。他说苏联、东欧国家和中国今年第一季度生产的钢，在历史上第一次超过了美国。单是苏联一个国家的钢产量就占美国的75％。
    艾伦·杜勒斯还说，苏联的煤产量约占美国的70％，工作母机的产量约比美国多一倍。他说，按国民生产毛值计算，苏联经济增长的速度比美国快一倍。
    共和党参议员贝奈特在宴会上说，他对美国商业迅速好转的可能性“并不乐观或者抱有希望”。
    贝奈特说，在庞大的军事开支和“反衰退”开支以外，如果再加上减税，可能使美国在今后十四个月内产生二百亿到二百四十亿美元的赤字。
    这个参议院财政委员会委员说，联邦政府的巨大支出将使本财政年度和下一财政年度产生一百亿到一百二十亿美元的赤字。而由于额外开支再加上减税，赤字可能增加一倍。
    贝奈特说，美国面临着“在某些地区买主罢买”的情况。在这方面他特别提到汽车，他认为这是买主“对高昂的价格”表示的“无声的反抗”。
    众议院军事拨款小组委员会主席、民主党人乔治·马洪说，美国在制造洲际弹道导弹方面仍然落在苏联后面。他并且说，如果美国执行目前正在执行或者计划中的军事计划，减税的希望将是“暗淡的”。
    出席美国商会年会的有四千个代表。
