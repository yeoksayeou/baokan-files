Plant More Sunflowers on Vacant Land
Hebei and Heilongjiang Mobilize the Masses to Plant Large Amounts of Oil Crops

This newspaper reports that Hebei Province will fully utilize all vacant land and saline-alkali depressions to plant sunflowers and other oil crops this year. Currently, farmers in five counties, including Hengshui, Wuyi, Zaoqiang, and Shenxian, have already planted more than 30,000 mu of sunflowers and other crops on vacant land. In Lincheng County, 59 agricultural cooperatives in nine townships, including Mengjiazhuang and Zhaozhuang, have planted more than 2,500 mu of castor beans and sunflowers on vacant land such as field edges and ditches. Chengde Prefecture is also actively planning and transporting seeds, preparing for a vigorous campaign of planting.

According to estimates by relevant provincial departments, there are approximately 3 million mu of land in Hebei Province that can be used to plant sunflowers and other oil crops. Assuming each person plants five sunflower plants, the province can produce 25 million jin of sunflowers. If we add the yield of five castor bean plants per person, these two items can not only increase farmers' income by 12 million yuan but also increase the nation's oil production by 25.6 million jin.

This newspaper reports that the Women's Federation of Houtian Township, Dongguang County, Hebei, mobilized women throughout the township to work hard day and night, planting oilseed crops on more than 800 mu of scattered idle land. Houtian Township has a lot of scattered idle land in 19 villages, such as field edges, plots, courtyards, and behind houses.

The Township Women's Federation led women throughout the township to calculate carefully and present the facts, identifying the three major benefits of planting on idle land that would benefit the country and the people: it can increase crop yields, increase the income of commune members, solve the difficulty of pig feed, and save food. Calculating that each castor bean plant yields four liang, and there are 1,500 plants per mu, one mu can yield 375 jin, at 1.5 jiao per jin, one mu can earn 50 yuan, and also increase the nation's oil supply. On the basis of unifying thoughts, identifying idle land, and collecting seedlings, the entire township organized 410 women's shock teams and launched a large-scale advance to idle land on March 13. In one day, all 841 mu of idle land in the township were planted with castor beans, sunflowers, vegetables, and melons. Dongguang County is now preparing to mobilize women to plant oil crops, vegetables, etc., on more than 12,000 mu of vacant land throughout the county.

This newspaper reports that Heilongjiang Province plans to increase oil production by 10,000 tons and feed production by 1 million tons this year. In order to ensure the realization of the oil production increase plan, the Provincial People's Committee recently proposed that each production team of the agricultural cooperative should use 0.5 to 1 hectare of land at field edges, barren mountains, depressions, saline-alkali land, and ditch banks outside the planting plan to plant oil crops; state farms, labor reform farms, and military reclamation farms should plant 15,000 hectares of oil crops without squeezing grain fields; vigorously mobilize farmers to plant more than ten sunflower and castor bean plants per person in front of and behind houses, garden plots, and roadsides, or harvest one jin of perilla seeds or castor beans; mobilize students, workers, and residents in towns and cities to plant oil crops; and mobilize elderly people, women, and students to collect wild oil materials.

    利用空闲地多种向日葵
    河北黑龙江发动群众大量种油料作物
    本报讯　河北省今年要充分利用一切空闲地和盐碱洼地种植向日葵等油料作物。现在衡水、武邑、枣强、深县等五县农民，已利用空闲地种植向日葵等三万多亩。临城县孟家庄、赵庄等九个乡的五十九个农业社，利用地边、沟壕等空闲地，播种了二千五百多亩蓖麻子和向日葵。承德专区也正积极的筹划和调运种籽，准备大力突种。
    据省有关部门估计，河北省可以利用种植向日葵等油料作物的土地有三百万亩左右。按每人种五株向日葵来说，全省就能生产向日葵两千五百万斤，如果加上每人种五株蓖麻子的产量，两项不仅可以给农民增加一千二百万元的收入，还可以给国家增加二千五百六十万斤的油脂。
    本报讯　河北东光县后店乡妇联发动全乡妇女苦战一昼夜，在八百多亩闲散地上种上了油料爪豆作物。后店乡共十九个村，场边、地头、庭院、屋后闲散土地很多。
    乡妇联领导全乡妇女算细账摆事实，找出了种植闲散地利国利民的三大好处：既能增加农作物产量，增加社员收入，又能解决猪饲料的困难，节约粮食，以每棵大麻子收四两计算，每亩一千五百棵，能收三百七十五斤，每斤一角五分，一亩就收入五十元，并且还给国家增加油料。在统一思想摸清了闲地，收集了样子的基础上，全乡共组织起四百一十个妇女突击小组，于3月13日向闲散土地大进军，一齐突击，一天的工夫，即把全乡八百四十一亩闲散地全部种上蓖麻、向日葵、蔬菜瓜果。东光县现正准备发动起妇女将全县一万二千余亩空闲地种油料作物、蔬菜等。
    本报讯　黑龙江省今年计划增产油脂一万吨，饲料一百万吨。省人民委员会为保证油料增产计划的实现，最近提出农业社的每个生产队都要在播种计划以外，利用地头地脑、山荒洼地、盐碱地、沟边壕沿，种植半公顷到一公顷油料作物；国营农场、劳改农场、军垦农场在不挤粮田的原则下，种植一万五千公顷油料作物；大力发动农民，利用房前房后，园田地边、道边沟沿，每人种植向日葵、蓖麻十株以上，或者收获苏子、蓖麻籽一斤；发动城镇的学生、职工、居民种植油料作物；动员老年人、妇女和学生，采集野生油料。
