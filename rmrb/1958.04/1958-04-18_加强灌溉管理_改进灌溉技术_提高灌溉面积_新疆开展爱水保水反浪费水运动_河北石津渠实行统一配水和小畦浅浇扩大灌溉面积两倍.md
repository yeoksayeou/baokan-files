    Xinjiang is Launching a Water Conservation Campaign
    Hebei's Shijin Canal Doubles Irrigated Area

    (By Our Newspaper) Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is launching a water conservation and anti-waste campaign focused on strengthening irrigation management.
    Xinjiang has little rainfall throughout the year, and more than 90% of the cultivated land relies on irrigation. The region is covered with snow-capped mountains and crisscrossed by rivers, with abundant water sources; approximately 70 billion cubic meters of water can be utilized annually. However, due to backward irrigation management and technology, less than 30% of the water actually reaches the fields, with the rest lost through leakage and seepage. At the same time, the common misconception among farmers that "the more water, the better" has led to excessively high irrigation quotas, with some areas using as much as 3,000 cubic meters per mu annually. This not only wastes water but also raises the groundwater level, causing severe soil salinization. Therefore, strengthening irrigation management in existing irrigation districts and educating the masses about rational water use has become crucial to changing the backward state of farmland water conservancy in Xinjiang.
    According to a survey by the autonomous region's water conservancy department, with rational water use, the existing water conservancy projects could double Xinjiang's irrigated area, increasing it by 25 to 30 million mu. Therefore, a water conservation and anti-waste campaign has been launched throughout the region. Agricultural cooperatives in various locations have held extensive debates and proposed many ways to save irrigation water. Counties like Fukang have established water management organizations at the district, township, and agricultural cooperative levels, implementing a three-shift irrigation system to ensure "round-the-clock management and continuous operation" to ensure that every drop of water reaches the fields. The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has reduced the irrigation quota for its 4 million mu of cultivated land by 30%, with an average irrigation volume of less than 400 cubic meters per mu, half to two-thirds lower than the irrigation quota for general agricultural cooperatives. Through debate, Shufu County reduced the irrigation quota per mu from 3,000 cubic meters to around 1,000 cubic meters. According to calculations by the autonomous region's water conservancy department, if the irrigation volume per mu can be reduced to around 1,000 cubic meters, the entire autonomous region can expand its irrigated area by 20 million mu.
    In order to improve the effective utilization coefficient of channels, many regions have begun to appropriately consolidate branch and trunk canals to reduce leakage losses. After Kucha County combined five parallel channels into one, it not only ensured water use for the original 80,000 mu of land but also saved the annual irrigation water for 50,000 mu of cultivated land.

    (By Our Newspaper) Thanks to strengthened irrigation management and improved irrigation methods, the irrigation area of the Shijin Canal irrigation district in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, has expanded from the original 330,000 mu to 1 million mu.
    The Shijin Canal diverts water from the Hutuo River at Huangbizhuang in Huolu County, flowing eastward for 90 kilometers through the northern suburbs of Shijiazhuang City and the counties of Gaocheng, Jin, and Shulu. The diverted water volume is 20 cubic meters per second, irrigating farmland in the northern suburbs of Shijiazhuang City and the counties of Gaocheng, Jin, Shulu, and Shen. The area is a cotton and wheat producing region, so the irrigation of the Shijin Canal plays a significant role in increasing cotton and wheat production.
    The Shijin Canal was built in 1948 by utilizing the unfinished Shijin Canal dug during the Japanese occupation. Initially, it irrigated only 170,000 mu. After gradual expansion year by year, it has been expanded to 1 million mu this spring.
    The Shijin Canal doubled its irrigated area with the original amount of water. In addition to widely advancing winter and spring irrigation and utilizing pits and ponds to store water to expand winter irrigation, strengthened management, unified water allocation, and the promotion of small furrow shallow irrigation to save water are very important reasons. The Shijin Canal has implemented a system of formulating water allocation plans from the bottom up. That is, according to the principle of "controlling the upper reaches and taking care of the lower reaches," each county proposes a plan for water use time and water volume from the bottom up, which is balanced and rationally allocated by the Shijin Canal Management Office. Each county then formulates detailed rules for water use based on the unified water allocation plan. Water distribution points have been established at the inlet of each county to implement the plan. In terms of saving water, the Shijin Canal irrigation area is also promoting the experience of small furrow shallow irrigation in the western irrigation area, that is, "canal irrigation gardenization." This experience is currently being promoted throughout the prefecture.
    Shijiazhuang Prefecture has recently further investigated the annual flow of the upper reaches of the Hutuo River, proving that the potential of the Hutuo River water source is still very large. It has been decided to expand the water diversion and channel projects of the Shijin Canal so that all the dry land west of the Fuyang River can be irrigated.

### 加强灌溉管理　改进灌溉技术　提高灌溉面积  新疆开展爱水保水反浪费水运动  河北石津渠实行统一配水和小畦浅浇扩大灌溉面积两倍

    加强灌溉管理　改进灌溉技术　提高灌溉面积
    新疆开展爱水保水反浪费水运动
    河北石津渠实行统一配水和小畦浅浇扩大灌溉面积两倍
    本报讯　新疆维吾尔自治区各地正在开展以加强灌溉管理为主的爱水、保水和反浪费水运动。
    新疆终年少雨，90％以上的耕地都靠引水灌溉。区内雪山绵亘，河流纵横，水源丰富，每年约有七百亿公方的水量可资利用。但是，由于灌溉管理和灌溉技术落后，拦蓄的水实际灌到田里的还不到30％，其余的水都流失渗漏了。同时，由于各地农民普遍存在着“浇水越多越好”的错误想法，造成了农田灌溉定额过高，有的地区竟多至每亩全年灌水三千公方，不但浪费了水，还提高了地下水位，造成了严重的土地盐碱化。所以加强现有灌区的灌溉管理工作，教育群众合理用水，成了改变新疆农田水利落后面貌的关键。
    根据自治区水利部门的调查，全区如能够作到合理用水，现有的水利工程就可以使新疆的灌溉面积加一倍，增加二千五百万亩到三千万亩的灌溉面积。因此，在自治区范围内开展了爱水、保水和反浪费水运动。现在各地农业社已经通过大辩论提出很多节约灌溉用水的办法。阜康等县各区、乡和农业社，还建立起水利管理组织，实行三班灌溉制度，作到“日夜有人，班班相接”，使渠水“点滴归田”。新疆军区生产建设兵团四百万亩耕地的灌溉定额降低了30％，平均每亩灌水不到四百公方，比一般农业社灌溉定额低一半到三分之二。疏附县通过辩论，使每亩毛渠引水定额由三千公方，降低到一千公方左右。根据自治区水利部门的计算，每亩灌溉量都能降低到一千公方左右，全自治区即可扩大二千万亩灌溉面积。
    为了提高渠道的有效利用系数，很多地区开始适当裁并支干渠，以减少渗漏损失。库车县把五条平行渠道并为一条后，除保证了原有八万亩土地用水，还节约了五万亩耕地的全年灌溉用水。　（谈风）
    本报讯　河北省石家庄专区的石津渠灌溉区，由于加强了灌溉管理和改进了灌溉方法，灌区面积从原来的三十三万亩扩大到一百万亩。
    石津渠由获鹿县黄壁庄地方引滹沱河水东流，经石家庄市北郊、藁城、晋县、束鹿等县境，全长九十公里；引出的水量是二十秒公方，灌溉石家庄市北郊和藁城、晋县、束鹿、深县等县的农田。当地为棉麦产区，因而石津渠的灌溉对棉花、小麦增产起很大的作用。
    石津渠是1948年我们利用日伪统治时所掘未成的石津运河修建的。初建成灌地仅十七万亩。以后逐年扩大，到今年春季已扩大到一百万亩。
    石津渠以原有的水量，灌区面积扩大了两倍，除广泛提早冬春灌及利用坑塘蓄水扩大冬灌外，加强管理，实行统一配水，和推行小畦浅浇节约用水是很重要的原因。石津渠实行了自下而上制定配水计划的制度。即根据“控制上游，照顾下游”的原则，由各县自下而上提出用水时间和用水量的计划，由石津渠管理处平衡和合理分配。各县再根据统一的配水计划制定用水细则。各县进水口都设立了配水点来执行计划。在节约用水方面，石津渠灌溉区还正推广西灌区的小畦浅浇的经验，即“渠灌园田化”，目前这个经验正在全专区推广。
    石家庄专区最近进一步调查了滹沱河上游的常年流量，证明滹沱河水源的潜力还很大。已决定扩建石津渠的引水工程和渠道工程，使滏阳河以西的旱地全部获得灌溉。
