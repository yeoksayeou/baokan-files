Guizhou Congjiang County Dong and Miao Farmers
    Used to Use Cattle for Fighting, Now Use Cattle for Plowing
    (Our report) According to Guizhou Daily news: The Dong and Miao farmers in Congjiang County, Guizhou, have historically not pierced the noses of cattle or used them for plowing. Their purpose for raising cattle was primarily for accumulating manure, secondly for fighting (bullfighting), thirdly for eating "xiangsi" and "gu?" (types of beef dishes), and fourthly for weddings and funerals. Last year, more than 80% of the county's farmland was cultivated by people pulling plows and digging the fields by hand, resulting in rough work and low yields.
    This year, the county organized a large number of people to visit advanced areas within the province. These people proposed piercing the noses of cattle and using them for plowing. However, some people still had concerns. Wei Jinrong, the deputy director of Cenfeng Cooperative, and member Wen Renzu, with the help of cadres, learned how to plow the fields. They then led the members in organizing a competition: a large field was divided into two sides, they used cattle to plow one side, and thirty-two members used people to pull plows and dig the other side. As a result, they finished plowing before the thirty-two members, and the quality was also better than that of the people-pulled plows.
    The masses were willing to pierce the noses of the cattle, but they did not know how to pierce them, how to make nose bags for the cattle, how to install plows, or how to plow the fields. Party organizations at all levels then led them to "take the Han people as teachers, take the models as teachers, and take the technicians as teachers." After learning how to use cattle for plowing, many members said gratefully, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's concern for us, who knows how long we would have been pulling plows!" Currently, most of the plowed land has been done by cattle.

    贵州从江县侗族苗族农民
    过去用牛打架  现在用牛犁田
    本报讯　据贵州日报消息：贵州从江县的侗族、苗族农民，历来不兴给牛穿鼻子和犁田。他们养牛的目的，一是为了积肥，二是打架（斗牛），三是吃“相思”、吃“牯?”，四是婚丧嫁娶。去年这个县有80％以上的田土都是用人拉犁、人挖田的方法耕种，活路做得粗放，产量很低。
    今年，县里组织大批人到省内先进地区参观，这些人提出穿牛鼻、用牛犁田的要求。但是有些人还有顾虑。岑丰社副主任韦金荣和社员文仁素在干部的帮助下学会了犁田，他俩就带领社员组织了一场比赛：一块大田划成两边，他俩用牛犁，三十二个社员用人拉犁、用人挖。结果他们俩比三十二个社员先犁完，质量也较牛犁的好。
    群众愿意给牛穿鼻了，可是不会穿、不会做牛鼻包、不会装犁、不会犁田。各级党的组织就领导他们“拜汉族为师、拜模范为师、拜技术员为师”。很多社员在学会了用牛犁田以后，感激地说：“要不是毛主席关心我们，不知拉犁拉到哪个年月！”目前已翻犁的田土，绝大部分都是牛犁。
