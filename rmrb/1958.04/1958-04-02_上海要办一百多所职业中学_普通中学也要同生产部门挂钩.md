Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai — Shanghai Municipality (including the directly governed counties of Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai) has decided to establish over one hundred agricultural middle schools, farmer's spare-time middle schools, and vocational schools for service industries. Regular middle schools throughout the city are also linking up with factories, enterprises, agricultural cooperatives, and handicraft cooperatives, universally engaging in work-study programs, and increasing courses on labor production knowledge.

The majority of agricultural middle schools, farmer's spare-time middle schools, and vocational schools are being established by the agricultural cooperatives and stores themselves. The curriculum of each school includes four or five subjects such as politics, language, mathematics, hygiene knowledge, and production knowledge, with the remaining time dedicated to participation in labor production. The six middle schools established by Miaohang and Gaojing townships in the northern suburbs have simple and makeshift school buildings and equipment, resolved locally, and have now all commenced classes. The vocational school for service industries established in Huangpu District has two classes: cooking and pastry making. They are borrowing tea houses within the district as classrooms, using the tea houses' spare time for classes, with the remaining time spent in stores, workshops, and kitchens for practical operation.

    上海要办一百多所职业中学
    普通中学也要同生产部门挂钩
    据新华社上海讯　上海市（包括直辖的嘉定、宝山、上海三县在内）决定创办一百多所农业中学、农民业余中学和服务性行业的职业中学。全市的普通中学也在同工厂、企业、农业社、手工业社挂钩，普遍进行勤工俭学活动，增加劳动生产知识课程。
    大部分的农业中学、农民业余中学和职业中学是由农业社和商店自己举办的。各校的课程设有政治、语文、数学、卫生知识和生产知识四、五门，其余是参加劳动生产。北郊区庙行、高境两乡创办的六所中学，校舍设备都是因陋就简，就地解决的，现在都已开学上课。黄浦区成立的服务性行业职业中学，设有烹饪和糕点两个班，他们都借用区内的茶馆当作课堂，利用茶馆的业余时间上课，其余的时间就是下店、下工场、下厨房实际操作。
