Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The American "Workers Weekly" recently published an article by Shields entitled "Venezuela is a Playground for the Rockefeller Gang". The abstract is as follows:

　　The revolution in Venezuela (referring to the armed uprising that overthrew the Jimenez dictatorship in January of this year – editor) greatly surprised Wall Street. The Rockefeller family, the Mellon family, and the Morgan bankers have always considered Venezuela entirely their own, just as Texas is entirely their own.

　　Yes, Venezuela has always been a paradise for intoxicated billionaires. Oil, iron ore, and land continue to bring unimaginable profits. Union workers and communists are hunted, detained, exiled, and massacred. One of Wall Street's chief financial editors could not hide his joy in a telegram from Caracas.

　　Wilfred Mei, editor-in-chief of the "Commercial and Financial Chronicle", began by saying: "It would be very appropriate if the dateline of this message were written: 'South American Texas'."

　　This Wall Street writer believes that American investors in Venezuela are very lucky. He said that investors are operating in a typical and very favorable atmosphere. Those in the highest income bracket only have to pay up to 28% in income tax. American managers earning up to $15,000 only pay $225 a year to Caracas tax collectors.

　　Yes, this is a happy paradise for American speculators. Merchants are accustomed to marking up the prices of goods by 100%. Since the establishment of the Military Committee (referring to the military junta committee formed when Jimenez seized power in 1948 – editor), the price of a seat on the Caracas Stock Exchange has increased two hundredfold. The price of a seat was 200,000 bolivars (Venezuelan currency, equivalent to approximately US$66,000) in 1956, while in the era of the democratic republic in 1947, it was only 1,000 bolivars.

　　This Wall Street editor happily praised the dictator's actions to destroy the trade unions.

　　He said: "Since those annoying trade unions that could cause trouble no longer exist, the labor situation is extremely good now. There is no active trade union movement at present. The few existing trade unions are all supported by the government...."

　　As O'Connor pointed out in "The Oil Empire", these "government-supported" trade unions were formed according to the well-known "Rockefeller Plan". These trade unions were modeled after the spineless company unions that Rockefeller Jr. established in his Colorado mines and steel plants after the Ludlow Massacre.

　　The heart of the counter-revolution is the oil company office. This oil conspiracy group is directed by the Rockefeller family from the Rockefeller Center's council hall in New York City.

　　Today, Venezuela's oil fields are one of the Rockefeller family's largest sources of profit. Nearly half of the huge income of Standard Oil of New Jersey - $700 to $800 million per year - is earned in Venezuela.

　　Other oil companies also exploit Venezuela's labor force. The huge Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company (a quarter of whose shares are owned by Americans) extracts nearly one-third of its total oil production from Venezuela. The Mellon Company obtains about one-sixth of its total oil production from Venezuela.

　　However, the Rockefeller family's Standard Oil Company - which owns more than two million acres of land - has the largest scale of derricks in the Lake Maracaibo area. At the same time, the Rockefeller family is also a powerful figure in Venezuela's banking, agriculture, fishing, dairy farms, and restaurants. Since they first obtained oil exploration rights, they have controlled all the dictatorial regimes in Venezuela.

　　Morgan bankers are also exploiting Venezuelan workers. Their United States Steel Corporation transports seven to eight million tons of iron ore annually from its mine opened in Cerro Bolivar near the Orinoco River.

　　Bethlehem Steel Corporation (in which the Mellon family has shares) also seizes several million tons of iron ore from Venezuela every year.

　　Of course, the ouster of dictator Perez-Jimenez is just the beginning. Even if his successors are ousted one by one and a democratic regime is established, things will not end there. The struggle will continue until the Venezuelan people control their own economic lifeline and until the corrosive influence of Rockefeller imperialism is eradicated.

### 美国“工人周报”刊文指出：委内瑞拉是洛克菲勒匪帮的冒险乐园

    美国“工人周报”刊文指出：
    委内瑞拉是洛克菲勒匪帮的冒险乐园
    新华社3日讯　美国“工人周报”不久以前发表了薛尔兹写的一篇文章，题目是“委内瑞拉是洛克菲勒匪帮的冒险乐园”。摘要如下：
    委内瑞拉的革命（指今年1月推翻希门尼斯独裁政权的武装起义——编者）使华尔街大吃一惊。洛克菲勒家族、梅隆家族以及摩根银行家一向认为委内瑞拉完全为他们所有，正如得克萨斯州完全为他们所有一样。
    是的，委内瑞拉一向是亿万富翁迷醉的乐园。石油、铁矿砂和土地不断带来令人难以想像的利润。工会工作者和共产党人遭到追逐、拘禁、流放、屠杀。华尔街首席财政编辑之一在一篇发自加拉加斯的电讯中竟无法掩饰自己的喜悦。
    “商业与金融纪事报”总编辑威尔弗里德·梅一开头便说：“这则消息的电头如果写作：‘南美得克萨斯州’，倒是非常恰当的”。
    这位华尔街作家认为，委内瑞拉的美国投资者非常幸运。他说，因为投资者是在典型的最良好的气氛中进行活动的。收入最高的一类人至多只需付28％的所得税。收入达一万五千美元的美籍经理，每年只向加拉加斯收税官缴纳二百二十五美元。
    是的，对于美国投机商来说，这是一个幸福的天堂。商人习惯于把商品的价格标高100％。自从军事委员会（指希门尼斯1948年夺得政权时组成的军政府委员会——编者）成立以来，加拉加斯股票交易所的席位价格涨了二百倍。席位价格在1956年是二十万波利瓦（委内瑞拉货币，约合六万六千美元），而在1947年民主共和国时代里只有一千波利瓦。
    这位华尔街编辑兴高采烈地赞扬独裁者破坏工会的举动。
    他说：“由于那些可能闹事的讨厌的工会不存在了，现在劳工的情况是极其良好的。目前没有积极的工会运动。寥寥无几的几个工会都是政府支持的……。”
    正如俄柯诺在“石油帝国”一文中指出，这些“政府支持”的工会是根据众所周知的“洛克菲勒方案”组成的。这些工会是仿效小洛克菲勒在鲁德劳惨案以后在他的科罗拉多矿山和钢铁厂建立起来的毫无骨气的公司工会建成的。
    反革命的心脏是石油公司办公处。这个石油阴谋集团是受到纽约市洛克菲勒中心议事厅的洛克菲勒家族的指挥的。
    今天，委内瑞拉的油田是洛克菲勒家族一个最大的利润来源。新泽西美孚油公司的巨额收入——每年达七、八亿美元——将近半数是从委内瑞拉赚到的。
    其他石油公司也榨取委内瑞拉的劳动力。规模巨大的荷兰皇家壳牌石油公司（其中四分之一的股份为美国人所有）在委内瑞拉所榨取的石油将近总产量的三分之一。梅隆公司在委内瑞拉所得到的石油约占总产量的六分之一。
    但是，洛克菲勒家族的美孚油公司——二百万英亩以上的土地都为它所有——在马拉开波湖地区起重机林列，规模最大。同时，洛克菲勒家族在委内瑞拉的银行业、农业、渔业、牛奶场和饭馆方面也是有势力的人物。自从他们第一次获得石油开采权以来，他们一直支配着委内瑞拉的所有独裁政权。
    摩根银行家也在剥削委内瑞拉工人。他们的美国钢铁公司每年要从它在奥里诺科河附近塞罗波利法尔开设的矿山运走七、八百万吨铁矿砂。
    伯利恒钢铁公司（其中有梅隆家族的股份）每年也要从委内瑞拉攫取几百万吨铁矿砂。
    当然，独裁者佩雷兹—希门尼斯的被赶下台只是一个开端。即使他的继承者也被一一赶下台并且建立了民主政权的话，事情也不会就此结束。在委内瑞拉人民尚未掌握自己的经济命脉以前，在洛克菲勒帝国主义的腐蚀影响尚未肃清以前，斗争将继续进行。
