As early as ancient Greece and Rome, cement made by mixing lime with natural volcanic ash was used as a building material. To this day, some of the buildings built at that time are still intact. The Aswan Dam, built in Egypt on the Nile River a thousand years ago, and other ancient canal buildings were built with lime-burnt clay cement and are still very strong.

The earliest use of lime-burnt clay cement in China was during the construction of the original Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from 1901 to 1910. 7% of the earthwork in the main projects of this railway was poured with this cement and has been in use for more than fifty years. During the Anti-Japanese War, the railways and water conservancy projects built in China mostly used this cement. In 1955, the Cement Scientific Research Institute of the former Ministry of Building Materials conducted systematic tests on this cement and further understood its performance.

In addition to being able to use local materials, simple equipment and manufacturing technology, and low cost, lime-burnt clay cement also has good hydraulic properties. It is still very strong in frequently humid places after a long period of time and has sufficient seepage resistance. Therefore, this cement can not only overcome the shortcomings of lime that is easily soluble in water, but also replace ordinary cement. The main disadvantage of this cement is that its compressive strength is lower than that of ordinary cement. Especially in dry environments, the bonding force is easily weakened and the strength is lost. Therefore, this cement is not suitable for permanently dry projects, but is suitable for water conservancy projects or frequently humid places. (Xinhua News Agency)

    石灰烧粘土水泥
    早在古代希腊和罗马时代，就开始使用石灰与天然火山灰拌制成的水泥作为建筑材料；到现在为止，当时建立的建筑物有的还很完好。一千年前埃及在尼罗河上建筑的阿苏安斯克大水坝，和其他古老的渠道建筑，都是用石灰烧粘土水泥建筑的，至今仍很坚固。
    我国最早使用石灰烧粘土水泥是在1901—1910年原滇越铁路的修建时期。这条铁道的主要工程中7％的石方是用这种水泥浇砌的，已使用了五十多年。抗战期间，我国修筑的铁路和水利工程，也多半采用这种水泥。1955年，前建筑材料部水泥科学研究院对这种水泥进行了系统的试验，更进一步了解了它的性能。
    石灰烧粘土水泥的优点除了可以就地取材、设备和制造技术简单、成本低廉外，它的水硬性也比较好，在经常潮湿的地方，经历了很久的年代还是很坚固，并有足够的渗抗性。因此这种水泥既可以克服石灰遇水后容易溶化的缺点，又能代替普通水泥。这种水泥的主要缺点是耐压强度较普通水泥低，特别是在干燥的环境中，粘结力容易削弱，失去强度。因此，这种水泥不宜用于永久干燥的工程中，而适用于水利工程或经常潮湿的地方。　（新华社）
