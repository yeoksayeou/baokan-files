    A special correspondent of Agence France-Presse, in a news report commenting on the conference of independent African states, wrote that there were two points about the speeches on the first day of the conference that "observers" had not anticipated and were surprised by: one was that "the heads of those delegations would express their anti-colonial sentiments so forcefully at the very beginning of the conference"; the other was that "the Sudanese and Ethiopian speakers would also criticize France's policies in Algeria," and criticize them "very sharply."
    The African people have suffered deeply from the disasters of colonialism, and of course they have strong anti-colonial sentiments. Why haven't the "Agence France-Presse" special correspondent and the "observers" he mentioned even thought of this and been surprised by it?
    It's actually quite simple: the brains of colonialists are specially made. Although the death knell has been tolling so loudly, they still believe that their acts of plunder and murder are matters of course, and brook no opposition from others. However, the times are not advancing according to what the colonialists think. If these gentlemen do not hurry up and change their thinking, they will encounter more "unanticipated" things; and one day, they will no longer have the mood for surprise, but can only weep bitterly.

    换换脑筋吧！
    “法新社”特派记者在评论非洲独立国家会议的新闻里写道，这个会议的第一天发言情况有两点是“观察家”们所没有想到和感觉惊奇的：一点是，“那些代表团团长会在会议一开始就这样气势汹汹地流露出他们的反殖民主义情绪”；另一点是，“苏丹和埃塞俄比亚发言人也会批评法国在阿尔及利亚的政策”，而且批评得“很尖锐”。
    非洲人民深受殖民主义的灾难，他们当然具有强烈的反殖民主义情绪。为什么“法新社”的特派记者和他所说的“观察家”们居然还没有想到和感觉惊奇呢？
    说来也很简单：殖民主义者的脑筋是特制的。尽管丧钟已经敲得那末响，而他们还认为自己的掠夺行为和杀人勾当是天经地义的事，不容别人反对。可是，时代并不是按照殖民主义者所想的那样前进的。如果这些先生们还不赶紧换换脑筋，他们会碰到更多“没有想到”的事；而且终有一天，他们将不再有惊奇的心情而只能抱头痛哭。
