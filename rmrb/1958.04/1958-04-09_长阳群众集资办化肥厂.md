    Changyang Masses Raise Funds to Build Fertilizer Plant
    The masses in Changyang County, Hubei Province, have invested in the construction of two fertilizer plants with an annual output of 10,000 tons. One plant produces calcium superphosphate, and the other produces ammonium sulfate. The phosphate fertilizer plant will be put into operation by the end of this year, and the ammonium sulfate plant will be put into operation in the third quarter of 1959. Both plants use mechanical production and require an investment of only 4.3 million yuan.
