Breaking Down Departmentalism, Establishing Collectivism
Three Colleges in Harbin Exchange Resources and Advance Together

(Our newspaper dispatch) According to Guangming Daily, Northeast Forestry College, Northeast Agricultural College, and Harbin Normal College are cooperating, exchanging resources, and supporting each other, resulting in many new developments in teaching and scientific research.

These three colleges are located close to each other, but in the past few years, there was little contact in teaching and research work, as if separated by an invisible wall. There were phenomena of varying degrees of idleness and shortage in manpower and equipment, without mutual allocation and utilization.

After the flames of the Double-Anti movement were ignited, teachers and students of the agricultural and forestry colleges posted big-character posters with slogans such as "Break through departmentalism and conservative thinking" and "Tear down the invisible wall." The Party committees of the two colleges immediately proposed cooperation, which was enthusiastically supported by teachers, students, and staff. Teachers from the Forestry Department of the Forestry College took the initiative to "connect" with relevant teaching and research groups at the Agricultural College. The Department of Logging and Transport, the Department of Wood Processing of the Forestry College, and the Department of Agricultural Machinery and the Department of Land Planning of the Agricultural College held joint meetings of the heads of teaching and research groups and Party, League, and union cadres to formulate measures for cooperation in manpower and material resources in teaching and research.

At this time, Harbin Normal College, which had already launched a wave of work-study programs, wanted to establish a comprehensive farm of 45,000 mu on the south bank of the Songhua River. A series of problems, such as the farm's planning, agricultural production technology, and agricultural machinery, required external support. After hearing this news, the teachers and students of the agricultural and forestry colleges immediately expressed their full support in terms of technology. Liu Chengdong, President of the Forestry College, Wang Fawu, Vice President of the Agricultural College, and the responsible comrades of the President and Party Committee of the Normal College, went to the farm together to survey the site and study the farm construction plan. The Agricultural College was willing to lend tractors and farm tools, and the Forestry College was willing to supply thousands of seedlings. The construction of the farm thus proceeded smoothly.

After the cooperation of the three colleges officially began in March, new phenomena that had never occurred before also appeared in teaching work. Because the three colleges shared instruments and equipment, a lot of funds were saved. For example, the Mechanics Teaching and Research Group of the Forestry College needed six "extensometers," and the Mechanics Teaching and Research Group of the Agricultural College had twelve, so it lent six, saving 3,600 yuan. The transformer of the Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Group of the Forestry College was not enough. Last year, the Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Group of the Agricultural College refused to lend it, but now it has taken the initiative to lend it. The agricultural and forestry colleges both wanted to establish thermal engineering laboratories in the past, but now they are preparing to establish them together. The hydraulic engineering laboratory of the Forestry College is also jointly used by the two colleges. The agricultural and forestry colleges each had a meteorological observation station, but now, after agreement, they are used jointly. The Agricultural College specializes in recording meteorological data, and the Forestry College provides it for students from both sides to practice. In this way, the problem of internships affecting meteorological records is solved. In terms of faculty, the three colleges also support each other. Teachers from the Meteorology Teaching and Research Group of the Agricultural College have already gone to the Forestry College to teach.

The scope of cooperation among the three colleges is gradually expanding. They have already discussed ways to share cars and save gasoline, and have also decided to borrow cultural and recreational supplies and exchange performances. Cultural and recreational expenses can be saved by 10,000 yuan per month. The nurseries of the agricultural and forestry colleges have also merged. Recently, the Party committees of the three colleges decided to hold regular joint meetings to consolidate the cooperative work.

Harbin Institute of Technology borrowed the boring machines from the workshop of the school's training factory for the factory to use.

### 破本位主义　立集体主义  哈尔滨三个学院互通有无共同前进

    破本位主义　立集体主义
    哈尔滨三个学院互通有无共同前进
    本报讯　据光明日报报道：东北林学院、东北农学院和哈尔滨师范学院，互相协作，互通有无，彼此支援，在教学、科学研究上出现了许多新气象。
    这三个学院院址紧相毗邻，但过去几年在教学和研究工作上，却很少联系，好像隔着一道无形的墙。在人力和设备上各有闲忙和余缺现象，没有互相调配使用。
    双反运动的烈火烧起来以后，农、林两院师生贴出“突破本位主义、保守思想”、“推倒无形的墙”的大字报。两院党委立即提出协作的倡议，得到师生员工的热烈拥护。林学院林学系的教师主动到农学院有关教研组去“挂钩”。林学院的采运系、木材加工系和农学院的农机系、土地规划系举行教研组主任和党、团、工会干部的联席会议，订出在教学、研究中人力物力的协作办法。
    这时候，已经掀起勤工俭学热潮的哈尔滨师范学院要在松花江南岸创办一个四万五千亩的综合农场，农场的规划、农业生产技术、农业机械等一连串问题，都需要外力的支援。农、林两个学院的师生，听到这个消息后，立即表示在技术上全力支援。林学院院长刘成栋、农学院副院长王发武和师范学院院长、党委负责同志，一同去农场勘查场地，研究建场规划。农学院愿意借给拖拉机和农具，林学院愿意供给树苗几千株。农场的建场工作就这样顺利地开展起来了。
    三个学院的协作在3月里正式开始以后，在教学工作上也出现了从来没有过的新气象。由于三院仪器设备互通有无，节省下许多资金。如林学院力学教研组需用六台“引伸计”，农学院力学教研组拥有十二台，便借给六台，节省了三千六百元。林学院电工教研组的变压器不够用，去年农学院电工教研组不肯出借，现在已主动借给。农、林两个学院过去都想建立热工实验室，现在已准备共同建立。林学院的水工实验室也由两院共同使用。农、林两个学院各有一个气象观测场，现在经过协议，共同使用。农学院的专做气象纪录，林学院的供双方学生实习。这样，就解决了实习影响气象纪录的问题。在师资方面，三个学院也互相支援。农学院气象教研组的教师已经去林学院上课。
    三个学院的协作范围正逐渐扩大。他们已经商订出共同使用汽车、节省汽油的办法，还决定互相借用文娱用品，交流演出节目。文娱用费全月可节省一万元。农、林两个学院的托儿所也合并了。最近，三院党委决定经常开联席会议，将协作工作巩固下去。
