Column: Editor's Note

    The human and animal experiments conducted by the Zhejiang Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine on using tadpoles for contraception have preliminarily proven that this method is ineffective, and the gastrointestinal tracts of tadpoles contain roundworm eggs and other parasites. Allowing women to swallow tadpoles alive for contraception is harmful to their health. Some newspapers, before obtaining experimental proof, widely introduced this contraceptive prescription to the masses, claiming it was "simple, economical, reliably effective, and without any side effects." While the motive was good, it was an irresponsible and unserious attitude towards the people's health. This is a serious lesson.

    China's medicine is rich. In recent years, thanks to the attention of the Party and the People's Government, many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and ordinary people have disclosed their family secret prescriptions to the government. This is a good phenomenon resulting from the correct leadership of the Party and the development of traditional Chinese medicine. However, due to the thousands of years of transmission of Chinese medicine, errors can easily occur, and the treatment in traditional Chinese medicine varies "according to the time, place, and person." Therefore, folk prescriptions should be scientifically analyzed, experimented with, and researched and verified before being promoted to ensure the health of the people.

    不要推广未鉴定的单方
    从浙江中医研究所蝌蚪避孕的人体和动物实验报告中，已初步证明这种避孕方法无效，而蝌蚪肠胃道内却有蛔虫等寄生虫卵。让妇女活吞蝌蚪避孕，对妇女的健康是有损害的。有些报纸曾经在未得到实验证明前即向群众广泛地介绍了这个避孕单方，说它“简便、省钱、稳当可靠和无任何副作用”，动机虽然是好的，但对人民健康却是不严肃负责的，这是一个严重的教训。
    我国的医学丰富，几年来，由于党和人民政府的重视，许多中医和群众纷纷向政府公开家传秘方，这是党的正确领导，祖国医学发展的好现象。但由于我国医学流传数千年，容易发生错讹，而且中医治疗是“因时、因地、因人”的不同用药各异，因此，民间单方在经过科学分析、实验和研究鉴定后再进行推广。才能对人民健康有所保证。
