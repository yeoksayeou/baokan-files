What to Learn from Hong'an County?
Zeng Dun, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China

In recent months, many comrades have visited Hong'an County to learn. Some have also learned about Hong'an's experiences from newspaper reports. What key experiences should people focus on learning? This is a question that every learner and visitor should consider. In my opinion, the main thing to learn is the revolutionary drive of the comrades in Hong'an County, to learn how they transformed their thinking and work style, got rid of the "five airs," restored the true color of the working people, integrated with technicians and laborers, worked together, studied together, and used the method of combining points and areas to lead large-scale high yields and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Some comrades have neglected this basic experience and focused their attention on visiting and studying the specific and detailed technical measures of a particular wheat experimental field. This approach is not good. The technical measures of high-yield experimental fields are beneficial to us. If we do not pay attention to technical measures, our targets will not be met. However, specific technical measures do not have universal significance. Because the main crops in various places are not all wheat, and the planting and high yield of wheat must also adopt different technical measures according to different objective conditions such as soil, climate, and variety. Therefore, we should not focus our attention on learning the specific technical measures of a certain high-yield experimental field, but should focus on learning their leadership style and leadership methods, learning how they use the three-way combination method of leading cadres, technical personnel, and peasant masses to conduct experiments, and use it to lead and promote large-scale high yields. If we change our work style and adopt the three-way combination method, then we will create technical measures suitable for our own conditions to plant our own experimental fields, so as to lead and promote our own large-scale high yields. Its yield is entirely possible to exceed the experimental field we visited.

Since planting experimental fields is a leadership method, we should of course not just learn the form of planting experimental fields. The practice of simply finding a piece of land, setting a yield, setting a measure, and inserting a sign after the visit, obviously does not grasp the key. Even the practice of conscientiously farming after the visit and obtaining high yields, but without driving the overall situation, is simply an isolated experimental field, which is also very insufficient. To drive and lead the overall high yield, we must study the main problems in local agricultural work. For example, in some places, some farmers lack confidence and methods in promoting japonica rice. In some places, some farmers do not believe that the local soil can increase production. Solving these problems will lead to a great leap forward in production. Then, we should conduct experiments on these issues, and after achieving results, summarize experience, organize visits, appraisals, and promote it to the entire area. This is in line with the policy of building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. Only by planting experimental fields in order to solve the universal and key problems in mass production will this experimental field be of concern to the masses.

Precisely because we want to use the experience of experimental fields to promote the overall situation, we should also pay attention to whether the measures we take can be achieved under the general conditions of the local area when conducting experiments. A production team leader, in order to achieve high yields in the experimental field, put all one hundred kilograms of chemical fertilizer allocated to the team by the higher authorities into the 2.8-mu experimental field. As a result, his experimental field grew taller, faster, and better than a nearby experimental field led by county-level leading cadres. This field has played a role in breaking down conservative ideas. It has also prompted visitors from industrial and commercial departments to more actively build fertilizer plants. However, his experience cannot be applied to the current general high-yield wheat fields. Therefore, it cannot play a role in leading and driving large-scale high yields. And without large-scale high yields, it is difficult to achieve the agricultural development plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target.

Planting experimental fields is not only a method of learning and studying production technology knowledge and specifically leading mass production; it is also a method of combining political work and economic work. Therefore, when using the method of planting experimental fields to lead production, we must not ignore the role of politics as the soul and commander. For example, Comrade Cheng Peng, secretary of the Hong'an County Party Committee, adopted the three-way combination method to plant experimental fields, and there was a struggle between the advanced and the conservative within this three-way combination, namely, the struggle between strip planting and spot planting of wheat. Comrade Cheng Peng insisted on strip planting of wheat, showing the superiority of strip planting, and the people who advocated spot planting finally surrendered verbally and mentally. The work of summarizing the experience of experimental fields, organizing visits, holding on-site meetings, conducting debates and appraisals, and promoting from point to area also runs through the struggle between the advanced and the conservative, the new operation methods and the old operation methods, and the new field management and cultivation system and the old field management and cultivation system. Therefore, when we learn from the comrades in Hong'an's work methods of studying production and leading production, we must also pay attention to learning their methods of doing political and ideological work. For example, they have recently emphasized that every cadre should achieve "five abilities" (that is, be able to produce, be able to work, be able to write articles, be able to summarize experience, and be able to create) and learn to be "five members" (agricultural and water conservancy technicians, livestock epidemic prevention personnel, fruit tree grafting personnel, propagandists, and accountants), all of which include being good at doing political and ideological work.

### 向红安县学习什么？

    向红安县学习什么？
    中共湖北省委宣传部长　曾惇
    几个月来，有许多同志到红安县参观学习。也有的是从报刊的介绍上学习红安的经验。人们主要地应当学习些什么经验呢？这是每一个学习和参观者应当考虑的问题。我认为，主要的应当是学习红安县同志们的革命干劲，学习他们的转变思想作风，去掉五气，还我劳动人民的本色，与技术人员、劳动人民打成一片，共同劳动，共同钻研，用点面结合的方法领导大面积的丰产，又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义。有的同志忽视了这种基本经验，而把主要注意力放在参观学习某一块小麦试验田的具体细致的技术措施上，这种方法是不好的。丰产试验田的技术措施对于我们是有益的。如果不注意技术措施，我们订的指标便会落空。但具体的技术措施却并不具有普遍意义。因为各地的主要农作物既不都是小麦，而且小麦的种植、丰产也须根据不同的土壤、气候、品种等等千差万异的主客观条件而采取不同的技术措施。所以我们就不能把主要注意力用于学习某一丰产试验田的具体技术措施，而应当用于学习他们的领导作风与领导方法，学习他们如何采用领导干部、技术人员、农民群众三结合的方法作试验，并且用以领导与推动大面积的丰产。若是我们转变了作风，采用了三结合的方法，那我们就会创造出适合自己条件的技术措施去种自己的试验田，借以领导和推动我们自己的大面积丰产，它的产量完全有可能超过我们所参观的试验田。
    种试验田既然是一种领导方法，那么我们当然不应该光从形式上学习种试验田，那种参观回去后仅仅找块土地，定个产量，定个措施，插块牌子完事的作法，显然没有抓住要害。就是那种参观回去后认真种田并且获得丰产，但是没有带动全面，仅仅是孤立的搞试验田的作法，也是很不够的。要带动与领导全面丰产，就必须研究当地农活中的主要问题。例如有些地方是某些农民对于推广粳稻缺信心、缺办法，有的地方是某些农民不相信当地的土壤能够增产，而解决这些问题则将使生产来一个大跃进。那么，我们就应该针对这些问题作试验，在获得成效后总结经验、组织参观、评比，推广到面。这才符合多快好省地建设社会主义的方针。也只有为着解决群众生产中带有普遍性、关键性的问题去种试验田，这块试验田才为群众所关心。
    正因为要用试验田的经验推动全面，在作试验时还应注意我们所采取的措施要是当地一般条件下都能办到的。有一个生产队长为了试验田的丰产，将上级分配给这个队的全部化肥一百斤通通下到了二亩八分试验田里，结果他的试验田比附近一块县级领导干部的试验田还长得多、长得快、长得好。这块田对于打破保守思想是有作用的。对于工业、商业部门的参观者，也起了促使他们更加积极地筹建化肥厂的作用。但是他的经验却不能适用于当前一般小麦丰产田。因此也就起不了领导与带动大面积丰产的作用。而如果没有大面积的丰产，那么，要提前与超额实现农业发展规划，是很困难的。
    种试验田，不仅是学习与钻研生产技术知识，具体领导群众生产的方法；也是政治工作与经济工作相结合的方法。因此，在使用种试验田的方法领导生产时，不能忽视政治是灵魂、是统帅的作用。例如红安县委书记程鹏同志采用三结合的方法种试验田，而这个三结合的内部就存在着先进与保守的斗争，即小麦条播与点播的斗争。程鹏同志坚持小麦条播，显示了条播的优越性，主张点播的人最后口服心服。总结试验田的经验，组织参观，开现场会议，进行辩论、评比，由点推广到面等工作中，也贯穿着先进与保守，新的操作方法与旧的操作方法，新的田间管理、耕作制度与旧的田间管理、耕作制度的斗争，因此，在我们学习红安同志的钻研生产、领导生产的工作方法时，还必须同时注意学习他们做政治思想工作的方法。例如他们最近强调每个干部都要做到五能（即能生产，能工作，能写文章，能总结经验，能创造），学成五员（农业水利技术员、牲畜防疫员、果树嫁接员、宣传员、会计员），就都包括了要善于做政治思想工作。
