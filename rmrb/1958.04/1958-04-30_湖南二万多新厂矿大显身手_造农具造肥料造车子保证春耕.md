    Changsha, April 29th (Our Newspaper) – Hunan Province has built over 20,000 small factories and mines this year.
    The vast majority of these factories and mines are farm tool factories and various fertilizer plants producing agricultural production materials, playing a significant role in supporting the current great leap forward in agricultural production. In the Xiangtan Special District, Xiangtan, Liling, and six other counties plan to establish about 3,000 such factories. After these factories are built, basically every township can have a joint factory, and every commune can have a fertilizer plant. A considerable portion of the production materials needed in rural areas this year can be solved locally. In Jinshi Township, Xiangtan County, production teams established granular fertilizer plants, and by the time rice transplanting is completed in the township, they will be able to produce 25,000 dan of granular fertilizer, enabling all paddy fields to use granular fertilizer as topdressing, applying an average of 150 to 200 jin per mu, ensuring the realization of a thousand-jin township. Currently, nearly 700,000 new types of human-powered and animal-drawn vehicles have been manufactured throughout the province, and nearly 100,000 kilometers of rural roads have been newly built and improved. This has played a significant role in ensuring the timely delivery of large quantities of fertilizer to the fields during spring ploughing.
    While establishing factories for agricultural production materials, various localities have also built various types of factories and mines according to local resources, funds, and technical capabilities. For example, among the larger factories and mines established in Shaodong County, there are eleven coal mines, and some iron mines and iron plants have also been expanded. Liling County is very rich in coal resources, so they mobilized the masses to build ninety-eight coal kilns, which now have a daily output of more than 600 tons. This year, the county can produce 700,000 tons, and in addition to meeting the needs of the county, it can also transfer more than 300,000 tons to support other areas.

    湖南二万多新厂矿大显身手
    造农具造肥料造车子保证春耕
    本报长沙29日电　湖南省今年已建成了二万多个小厂矿。
    这些厂矿，绝大部分是生产农业生产资料的农具厂和各种肥料厂，对支援当前农业生产大跃进有着很大作用。湘潭专区的湘潭、醴陵等八个县，计划办的这类厂子有三千来个。这些工厂建起后，基本上可以做到每乡一个联合工厂，社社有肥料厂，今年农村需要的生产资料有相当大的一部分就能就地得到解决。湘潭县锦石乡在三天中队队建立了颗粒肥料厂，到全乡插秧结束时能生产出二万五千担颗粒肥料，使全部水田都用颗粒肥料作追肥，平均每亩下一百五十斤到二百斤，保证实现千斤乡。全省目前新造的各式人力、畜力车近七十万辆，新修和改进的乡村道路近十万公里。这对保证在春耕中把大量肥料及时送到田里，起了很大作用。
    在建立农业生产资料工厂的同时，各地还都根据本地的资源、资金和技术力量等条件，兴建各种类型的厂矿。如邵东县兴办的较大厂矿中，便有十一个煤矿，另外还扩建了一些铁矿铁厂。醴陵县煤的资源非常丰富，他们就发动群众办了九十八座煤窑，现在日产量达六百多吨，今年全县能产七十万吨，除满足本县需要外，还可调出三十余万吨支援外地。
