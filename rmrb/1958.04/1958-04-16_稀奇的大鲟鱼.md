A rare large sturgeon

A few days ago, members of the Yinghao Cooperative in Yingwen Township, Wanning County, Guangdong Province, caught a large sturgeon in the Yinghao Fishing Ground that the fishermen had never seen before. This fish was 2.56 meters long and weighed more than 230 catties. The shape of the fish was peculiar; the mouth grew on its abdomen, was round and protruded outward, toothless, and retractable. There were five rows of plate-like hard scales growing around the body, each row with fourteen to twenty-eight scales. The areas on the body without hard scales were smooth. Its bones were very soft, and the meat was fine, smooth, and delicious. The Wanning County Fisheries Technology Guidance Station has made this fish into a specimen.

    稀奇的大鲟鱼
    前些日子，广东省万宁县英文乡英豪社的社员在英豪渔场捕获一条渔民们从来没有见过的大鲟鱼。这条鱼身长二点五六公尺，体重二百三十余斤。鱼的形状古怪，口是生长在腹上的，呈圆形向外凸出，口中无齿能伸缩。鱼身周围生长有五行板状的硬鳞，每行硬鳞有十四到二十八片鳞片，身体上没有硬鳞的地方则是平滑的。它的骨很软，肉细、滑、好吃。万宁县渔业技术指导站已将这条鱼制成标本。
