    After the Rectification Movement, Order is Well-Maintained and the Atmosphere is Fresh and New

    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Yan Wu reports: After several months of rectification movement, Guanzhuang, once known as the "Kingdom of Freedom," has become a socialist area with good order and a fresh new atmosphere.

    The hidden counter-revolutionaries, hooligans, and bad elements that were rampant in Guanzhuang have been purged, and the social atmosphere has changed. Since the struggle to eliminate the "Kingdom of Freedom," no theft cases have occurred in Guanzhuang. Now the police station has new business; they have received many cases of lost and found items. Even if a child finds a coin or a pear, they will automatically give it to the police uncle. According to statistics, the police station has received more than 600 lost items in recent months, including clothes, handbags, pens, and brand-name watches. In the bathhouses, people used to be afraid to wear leather shoes, but now people carry pens and watches into the bathhouses without any worry.

    In this general election, the workers and their families in Guanzhuang showed great political enthusiasm, and 100% of the voters participated in the voting. One old mother, who was sick in bed, insisted that her daughter-in-law support her to go to the election site to vote. Recently, the Guanzhuang subdistrict started a rectification campaign, and the housewives automatically pooled money to buy paper and ink, write big-character posters, and enthusiastically offer opinions on the work of the government.

    The once dirty and messy Guanzhuang has now changed, and many model units and dormitories have emerged. Since the launch of the Patriotic Health Campaign to eliminate the Four Pests, they have killed 13,652 rats, 8,696 sparrows, and 438 catties of fly pupae. Many engineers and technicians automatically wipe the floors and clean the corridors in their spare time every day.

    The working attitude of the personnel in the service departments has also changed greatly. In the past, it was very difficult to make a phone call from downtown Beijing to Guanzhuang, but now the telephone operators have achieved "three fasts and three no's" in their operations—fast connection, fast hang-up, and fast disconnection, and no idle chat, no wrong telephone connections, and no leakage of secrets. The medical staff in the health center care for patients as if they were relatives. They not only take consistent responsibility for the diagnosis and treatment of patients, but also visit patients at home and provide amateur treatment outside of clinic hours. In the past, the salespersons of the cooperative had great conflicts with the masses. If a housewife picked and chose when buying pork, the salesperson would impatiently say: "Why don't you raise your own pig!" Now their service attitude has changed, and they take the initiative to ask customers about their needs and try to meet their requirements, and the phenomenon of queuing has been eliminated.

    In February, a happy event occurred in Guanzhuang—a couple who had been separated for eight years reunited. The main reason for their reconciliation was that the man, Wang Shouqing, criticized his bourgeois view of love that favored the new and abandoned the old, and decided to take his wife and daughter back home. His wife, Yu Guixiu, happily said to others: "After the State Council working group came here, I thought, the People's Government can 'bring back' my husband. My child and I have been waiting for it day and night. On February 7th, my lover finally came back. I thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart."

    The improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses of workers in Guanzhuang is fully demonstrated in the sky-high drive in the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement. The shock brigades organized by the young people worked hard overnight, turning over drawings, looking for plans, and checking programs. With the assistance of the engineers, they set up six anti-waste exhibitions within 24 hours. These exhibitions vividly and centrally exposed the serious waste caused by bourgeois ideology and work style.

    In the great contention and great debate, people took a responsible attitude as masters of the country, used their brains, thought of ways, and did not let go of the debate over "one cent." Engineers such as Qi Baolin, with a spirit of bold innovation, conducted a comprehensive dissection of the Datong Cement Plant, and believed that 22 million yuan could be saved from the original investment of 52 million yuan, and a cement plant with the same output could still be built. In terms of project progress, the plant was originally designed in 30 months. After this debate, they are confident that they can design it in 10 months, and based on this, they proposed the initiative of "one becomes two, one day equals three" to Guanzhuang. This initiative was immediately echoed by all parties, and each department and office successively determined their respective leap forward targets through great contention and great debate.

    In these boiling days, people debated and rescued at the same time, and tried to avoid avoidable waste immediately. In the five days and five nights of great debate and great rescue, the Cement Design Institute salvaged an investment of 20.07 million yuan for the country from the six cement plants under construction and expansion, and also increased the annual output of cement by 380,000 tons due to the increased utilization rate of equipment.

    These gratifying new atmospheres in Guanzhuang have made people begin to realize the great significance of politics for technology and redness for expertise. Many people who did not ask about politics in the past have begun to walk out of the "tower of technology." Jiang Guangzeng, an engineer in his sixties, said excitedly to reporters after the debate: "The facts have educated me: pure expertise without redness will inevitably lead to the dead end of capitalism; without a sense of dedication to serving socialism, it is like a machine without power, how can there be revolutionary enthusiasm!"

    Today's Guanzhuang has fully demonstrated the socialist spiritual outlook.

    经过整风运动　秩序井然气象一新
    本报讯　记者阎吾报道：经过几个月整风运动的洗礼，一度被称为“自由王国”的管庄，已经变成了秩序井然、气象一新的社会主义地区。
    在管庄猖獗一时的暗藏的反革命分子、流氓、坏分子被肃清了，社会风气有了转变。从消灭“自由王国”斗争以来，管庄没有发生过盗窃案件。现在派出所增加了新的业务，他们受理了许多拾金不昧的事情，甚至小孩子拾到一枚硬币或者一个梨，也自动送给警察叔叔。据统计，派出所几个月来招领的失物有六百多件，其中有衣服、皮包、钢笔和名牌的手表。在澡堂里，过去人们甚至不敢穿皮鞋进去，现在人们携带钢笔、手表进澡堂已毫无顾忌。
    在这次普选中，管庄的职工和家属们表现出很大的政治热情，百分之百的选民参加了投票。有一位病倒在床上的老妈妈，硬要儿媳搀扶着她，到选举的现场去投票。最近，管庄街道开始整风，家庭妇女们自动凑钱买纸墨，写大字报，踊跃地给政府工作提意见。
    过去又脏又乱的管庄现在变样了，并且出现了许多模范单位和宿舍。从开展除四害讲卫生运动以来，他们已捕杀老鼠一万三千六百五十二只，捕打麻雀八千六百九十六只，消灭蝇蛹四百三十八斤。许多工程师和技术员们每天自动在业余时间擦地板打扫走廊。
    服务性部门的人员工作态度也有了很大转变。过去从北京市内向管庄打电话非常困难，现在电话员们在话务上已做到“三快三不”——快接、快挂、快撤线和不闲谈、不错送电话、不泄露机密，卫生所的医务人员们，把病人当作亲人来关怀，他们不但对病人的诊断治疗采取一贯负责制，还在门诊时间以外到病人家里访视，进行业余治疗。以前，合作社的售货员同群众有很大的矛盾，家庭妇女买猪肉如果进行挑选，售货员就不耐烦地说：“你为啥不自己养个猪！”现在他们的服务态度转变了，主动地向顾客问长问短，尽量满足顾客的要求，而且消灭了排队现象。
    2月间，管庄出现了这样一件喜事——有一对已分居了八年的夫妇重新团圆了。他们和好的主要原因是男方王寿清批判了他的喜新厌旧的资产阶级恋爱观，决心把妻子和女儿接回家来。他的妻子于桂秀高兴地对人说：“国务院工作组来到这里以后，我就想，人民政府能把我的丈夫‘要’回来就好了，我们母子早晚的盼望着，就在2月7日这天，我的爱人终于回来了。我从心里感谢共产党、感谢毛主席。”
    管庄广大职工政治觉悟的提高，充分地表现在反浪费反保守运动中那种冲天的干劲。青年们组织的突击队更是连夜苦干，他们翻图纸、找计划、查方案，在工程师们的协助下，二十四个小时以内布置了六个反浪费展览会，这些展览会鲜明而集中地揭发了由于资产阶级思想和作风所造成的严重浪费。
    在大争大辩中，人们以对国家负责的主人翁态度，动脑筋，想办法，不放过“一分钱”的争辩。齐宝林等工程师以大胆革新的精神，将大同水泥厂作了全面的解剖，认为可以从原投资五千二百万元中节省出二千二百万元，照样能建成同样产量的一个水泥厂；在工程进度上，这个厂原先是用三十个月设计成的，经过这次辩论，他们有把握在十个月内就可以设计出来，并且以此为根据，向管庄提出了“一个变两个，一天顶三天”的倡议。这个倡议立刻得到各方面的响应，各科、室纷纷通过大争大辩，定出各自的跃进指标。
    在这些沸腾的日子里，人们一面辩论，一面进行抢救，能够避免的浪费，立即设法避免。水泥设计院在五天五夜的大辩论、大抢救中，从正在修建和扩建的六个水泥厂里，为国家挽救出二千零七万元的投资，并且还由于提高了设备利用率，每年可以增产三十八万吨水泥。
    管庄出现了这些可喜的新气象，使人们开始体会到政治对于技术、红对于专有着多么重大的意义。许多过去不问政治的人，已开始走出“技术之塔”。一位年已花甲的工程师蒋光曾经过辩论后，激动地向记者说：“事实教育了我：光专不红，必然会走到资本主义的死胡同里；没有为社会主义服务的事业心，就好像一架机器没有动力一样，那能有革命的干劲呢！”
    今日的管庄已经充分显示出社会主义的精神面貌。
