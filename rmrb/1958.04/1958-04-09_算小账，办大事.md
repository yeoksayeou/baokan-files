Small Accounting, Big Accomplishments

In the countryside, there are many vacant lots around houses, along field ridges and corners, and along ditches and roadsides. When people calculate the big picture, they often forget these lands because they are scattered and not worth calculating. In fact, small accounts cannot be ignored. Many small accounts added together become a big account. Doing a good job of small accounting can lead to big accomplishments. Today, when everyone is arranging measures to increase production and striving for a great leap forward in production, the method of accounting is worth studying. In Lincheng County, Hebei Province, nine townships and fifty-nine agricultural cooperatives have already planted oil crops on scattered vacant land, totaling more than 25,000 mu. This shows that the people here are really good at accounting, calculating a big account from small accounts, and making people see the potential for increasing production on vacant land. Therefore, we advocate that every agricultural cooperative should calculate this small account and plant oil crops on all vacant land.

Today, everyone is meticulously cultivating large areas of land, demonstrating a deep affection for the land. However, large and small plots should be treated equally. This is especially true for land; even if it is just a tiny speck, it never disappoints those who work diligently.

### 算小账，办大事

    算小账，办大事
    农村里门前屋后、田埂地角、沟边路沿都有许多空闲地。这些地，人们在算大账的时候往往把它遗忘了，原因是它们星星点点，不值得一算。其实，小账可不能不算。许多小账加在一起就成了大账，把小账算好了，就可以办大事。当大家正在安排增产措施，力争生产大跃进的今天，算账的方法很值得研究。河北临城县九个乡五十九个农业社已经在零散的空闲地上种上油料作物，总数有二万五千多亩。足见这里的人真会算账，从小账中算出大账，使人看到空闲地增产的潜力。因此，我们提倡每个农业社都来算一下这笔小账，把空闲地都种上油料作物。
    今天，大家在大片的土地上精耕细作，表现了对土地有很深的感情；但是，大块小块应当一视同仁才好。土地就是如此，哪怕它是一星一点，它对一切殷勤劳动的人，却从不曾辜负过。
