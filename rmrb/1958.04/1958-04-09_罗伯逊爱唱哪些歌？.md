　　Robeson is a sincere artist who deeply loves Black art and life. He repeatedly quotes this Spanish proverb: "Sing me a folk song of yours, and I can tell you the characteristics, aspirations, customs, and history of that nation."
　　He dedicated his life to truthfully presenting to the public the artistic creations that originally "expressed various aspects of Black people's lives, their character and soul, their hopes and aspirations, and their long struggle for the rights to survival, independence, and freedom." (Robeson, "On Black Folk Songs")
　　Although the fate of Black people in America is so tragic, brilliant and inspiring songs were born among this enslaved people, among this people who suffered the dual oppression of cruel exploitation and racial discrimination.
　　Robeson, this great artist, traveled the world with the beautiful art of his nation, telling people about their misfortune and aspirations, and striving for the broad masses of the people to jointly overthrow the reactionary rule and defend world peace.
　　Among his songs, the most moving are "Go Down Moses," "Ol' Man River," "Water Boy," "Cotton Picking Song," "We Will Sing" ... etc.
　　"Go Down Moses" is a folk song passed down from their ancestors (African Black people). The Black people use this ancient heroic song to constantly awaken their compatriots to participate in the struggle. The lyrics are:
　　Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land,
　　Tell old Pharaoh,
　　Let my people go.
　　When Israel was in Egypt's land,
　　Let my people go,
　　Oppressed so hard they could not stand,
　　Let my people go.
　　Robeson also loves to sing "Ol' Man River," which tells that "Black people work on the Ol' Man River (Mississippi River) from dawn to dusk, until death, without rest, while white people are enjoying themselves. Ol' Man River, it knows the most, but it remains silent, just flowing endlessly." This feeling of resentment and anger, through a painful and indignant melody, tells the people of the world how the Black people live in the so-called "free world" of American rulers.
　　Robeson also often sings a folk song called "Picking Cotton," which profoundly depicts the greed, selfishness, and bottomless exploitation of American capitalists.

    罗伯逊爱唱哪些歌？
    李凌
    罗伯逊是一位深爱黑人艺术和生活风习的真挚的艺术家。他一再地重复着这个西班牙谚语：“给我唱一支你们的民歌，我就可以向你们讲出这个民族的特性、愿望、风俗和历史”。
    他终生从事于使那些原来是纯朴的“表现黑人民族诸方面生活，黑人民族性格和灵魂，他们的希望与憧憬，他们为了争取生存权利、独立、自由而进行长久斗争的艺术创作，使它如实地呈现众人之前。”
  （罗伯逊“论黑人民歌”）
    美国黑人的命运虽然如此悲惨；然而，就在这被奴役的人民中间，在这遭受惨酷的剥削与种族歧视双重压迫的人民中间，诞生了辉煌而又激动人心的歌曲。
    罗伯逊这个伟大的艺术家，带着他们民族优美的艺术，走遍世界，向人们述诉这个民族的不幸和志向。争取广大的人民来共同推翻反动统治，保卫人类和平。
    他的歌唱中，最使人激动的是“去吧！摩西”、“老人河”、“水孩”、“摘棉歌”、“我们引吭高歌”……等。
    “去吧！摩西”是一首他们祖先（非洲黑人）流传下来的民歌，黑人民族借着这支古老的英雄的歌篇来时时刻刻地唤醒同胞参加斗争。这首歌词是：
    去吧！摩西。去到埃及国土，
    告诉那年迈的法老，
    让我们的人民出来，
    当以色列在埃及，
    压迫太甚，难以生存。
    罗伯逊还爱歌唱那首“老人河”，这首歌曲述说：“黑人在老人河（密西西比河）从天明到日落，直到死亡都不得休息，而白人却在享乐。老人河，它知道事情最多，它却一声不响，只管滔滔地流，不息地流”。这种怨恨和愤怒的心情，通过一支沉痛而激愤的曲调，告诉全世界的人民，在美国统治者的所谓“自由世界”里黑人民族是怎样生活的。
    罗伯逊还常常演唱一首民歌“摘棉花”，这首民歌深刻地刻划了美国资本家的贪婪、自私和无底的掠夺。
