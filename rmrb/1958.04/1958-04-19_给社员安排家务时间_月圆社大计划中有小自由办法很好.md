    Arrange Household Chore Time for Commune Members;
    The Yueyuan Commune's Plan Incorporates Small Freedoms – A Very Good Method

    (Reported by this newspaper) When collective production in agricultural cooperatives is very intensive, how to appropriately arrange some time so that members can engage in private plot production and household chores? The Yueyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Shiziqiao Township, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, has created a good method in this regard.

    This method is that the management committee of the agricultural cooperative, when arranging collective production for each team in the short term (five to seven days), includes the household chore time of the members (half a day or a day) in the calculation and explains to each production team that if they can complete the tasks stipulated by the cooperative ahead of schedule with guaranteed quality and quantity, the time saved can be used by the members for household chores. In early April, the cooperative needed six days to repair roads and plant trees, but at this time, members needed to plant sweet potato seedlings (for pig feed) and grow melons and vegetables on their private plots, as well as do household chores such as transporting coal. The cooperative management committee stipulated that these tasks should be completed within seven days, with one day allocated to members for household chores. After the members clarified their tasks, they did a good job of both collective production and household chores within the specified time.

    The Yueyuan Commune's appropriate arrangement of time for members' household chores and private plot production has not affected the cooperative's collective production. On the contrary, because members' household chores are well arranged and they have no worries, they are more active in collective labor. Every production task assigned by the cooperative is completed ahead of schedule. All three shock fertilizer accumulation campaigns in the commune were completed one or two days ahead of schedule. Members' private plots were also all planted with sweet potato seedlings and melon and vegetable seeds, and there was no shortage of coal for burning.

    In the past, this commune only paid attention to collective production and did not appropriately arrange time for members' household chores. Drums had to be beaten and cannons fired every day to call people to work, and the team leader had to urge people to work door-to-door, yet members did not come to work in an orderly manner. Now, due to the adoption of such measures, coupled with the implementation of the "knowing the year in advance" and "three guarantees and five responsibilities to the plot" systems in the commune, members no longer need to be urged to go to work.

    Currently, all seventeen agricultural cooperatives in Shiziqiao Township have widely adopted the Yueyuan Commune's method, and production throughout the township is progressing rhythmically. (Gao Changren)

### 给社员安排家务时间  月圆社大计划中有小自由办法很好

    给社员安排家务时间
    月圆社大计划中有小自由办法很好
    本报讯　在农业社集体生产十分紧张的时候，如何适当安排一些时间，使社员们可以从事自留地生产和家务劳动，湖南宁乡县狮子桥乡月圆农业社在这方面创造了好办法。
    这个办法就是农业社的管理委员会在短期（五天到七天）安排各队集体生产时，把社员的家务劳动时间（半天或一天）计算在内，向各生产队说明：如果能如质如数提前完成社里规定的任务，节省下来的时间，社员便可从事家务劳动。4月上旬，这个社修路、造林需要六天时间，但这时社员的自留地要下红薯种（种猪饲料用）、种瓜菜，还有运煤等家务事要做。社管理委员会就规定这些任务要在七天内完成，其中有一天时间给社员从事家务劳动。社员们在明确任务后，在规定时间内，把集体生产和家务劳动都搞得很好。
    月圆社这样适当安排社员家务劳动和在自留土上生产的时间，并没有影响社里的集体生产。相反地，由于社员家务劳动安排好了，无后顾之忧，从事集体劳动更积极。社里每一段分配的生产任务，都能提前完成。全社三次突击积肥运动，每次都提前一两天完成。社员的自留土也全部下了红薯种、瓜菜种，烧煤不缺。
    过去，这个社由于领导上光注意集体生产，没有适当安排社员家务劳动的时间，每天出工都要打鼓、放铳，队长挨户催工，社员出工还不整齐；现在，由于采取了这样的措施，加上社里实行一年早知道和三包五到丘等制度，社员出工不要人催了。
    现在，狮子桥乡十七个农业社，都普遍采用月圆社的办法，全乡生产都能有节奏地进行。（高长任）
