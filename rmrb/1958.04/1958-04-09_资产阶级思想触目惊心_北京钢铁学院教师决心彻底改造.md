    Shocking Bourgeois Ideology
    Teachers of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Resolve to Thoroughly Reform
    (Our Dispatch) Since the launch of the "Double-Anti" movement at the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel, nearly 700,000 big-character posters have been put up. A major part of their content is the exposure and criticism of bourgeois teaching ideologies among teachers.

    Some teachers emphasize professional skills while neglecting politics, openly advocating "technology first." In class, they tell students that "those engaged in social sciences and politics are failures. You must study hard, otherwise no one will respect you in the future." They encourage students to be professionally proficient but not politically conscious.

    In teaching, a disregard for practical application and detachment from reality is also a common phenomenon. There is a prevailing opinion among teachers at the Institute of Iron and Steel that only theory is scientific, and only those with low levels engage in practical work. Teachers are unwilling to go to the laboratory or the factory, believing that there is nothing to learn in the factory. Some even look down on factory technicians, saying, "The world's famous scientists are all engaged in theory; engineers are nothing great."

    Some teachers, when lecturing or guiding design, do not consider China's construction realities. Some teachers in the Ironmaking Teaching and Research Group do not explain the methods of raw material processing in current Chinese factories. Many graduation design topics are also divorced from China's current construction needs. For example, teachers in the Pressure Processing Teaching and Research Group, in their pursuit of large scale and novelty, ask graduates to design a 3 million-ton annual output primary rolling mill. Many teachers are also unwilling to combine scientific research with production. They are unwilling to work on small-scale projects, preferring large-scale ones; unwilling to work on practical projects, preferring theoretical ones. As a result, scientific research work at the Institute of Iron and Steel has not made much progress in the past two years, and many research projects have had to be abandoned halfway despite great efforts and financial investment. The Steelmaking Teaching and Research Group has researched sixteen topics in the past two years, but only three have yielded results. There is also a prevailing opinion among teachers at the Institute of Iron and Steel that teaching is "output," while engaging in scientific research and advanced studies is "input." Therefore, a large proportion of teachers only value personal advanced studies, translation work, and scientific research. Some teachers are busy earning royalties from their translation work and are unwilling to write lecture notes for students. Some teachers do not grade students' assignments; some collect students' assignments and return them only after a year; some simply throw them in the wastebasket or lose them. Some teachers try to teach as few classes as possible in order to focus on their own scientific research. If classes are assigned to them, they have a trick: not preparing lessons well. Some teachers are still using lecture notes written several years ago. Some prepare for only half an hour for a ninety-minute lecture, and some simply do not prepare at all.

    The phenomenon of teachers vying for fame and gain, excluding each other, and being uncooperative is quite serious. Almost every teaching and research group has had internal conflicts; there are disputes among the seven professors in the Mining Department. Some teachers are conducting scientific research on the same topic, but instead of cooperating, they undermine each other. Due to the lack of unity among teachers, not only has it brought great losses to teaching and scientific research, but it has also caused huge material waste. Due to conflicts between departments and teaching and research groups, they are unwilling to share resources, resulting in duplicate equipment. The four professional laboratories in the Department of Metallurgy all have chemical analysis rooms, darkrooms, metallographic rooms, and balance rooms.

    Faced with these shocking facts, teachers have begun to realize the great harm of bourgeois ideology. Everyone is determined to "transform themselves" and thoroughly reform in this movement.

### 资产阶级思想触目惊心  北京钢铁学院教师决心彻底改造

    资产阶级思想触目惊心
    北京钢铁学院教师决心彻底改造
    本报讯　北京钢铁学院自开展双反运动以来，共贴出了近七十万张大字报，重要内容之一是揭露和批判了教师中的资产阶级教学思想。
    有的教师重业务，轻政治，公开宣扬技术第一，在课堂上对学生说“搞社会科学的，搞政治的都是没出息的人。你们要好好念书，否则将来就没有人看得起”。鼓励学生只专不红。
    教学中轻视实际，脱离实际，更是一种普遍现象。钢铁学院教师中有那么一种舆论：唯有理论才是科学，水平低的才去搞实际。教师不愿下实验室，不愿去工厂，认为工厂中没有什么可学的；还有人看不起工厂技术人员，说什么：“世界上著名的科学家都是搞理论的，工程师没有什么了不起。”
    有些教师在授课或指导设计时不结合我国建设实际，炼铁教研组有些教师不讲解我国现厂原料处理方法。许多毕业设计的题目也是脱离我国当前建设实际的。比如压力加工教研组教师贪大贪新，叫毕业生设计三百万吨年产量的初轧厂。不少教师的科学研究工作也是不愿意和生产相结合。不愿搞小的，只愿搞大的；不愿搞实际，只愿搞理论，因而这两年钢铁学院科学研究工作进展不大，有许多研究工作花了很大的精力和财力却不得不半途而废了。炼钢教研组近两年研究了十六个题目只有三个有结果。钢铁学院教师中还流传一种舆论：教学是“输出”，搞科学研究、搞进修是“输入”。所以有很大一部分教师只重视个人进修、搞翻译和科学研究。有些教师忙于自己搞翻译赚稿费，不肯给同学编写讲义。有些教师不批改同学作业，有的把同学作业收去隔年才退还；有的干脆就丢到纸篓里或者遗失了。有的教师为着自己搞科学研究尽量少担任课。如果分到自己头上了，也有个窍门——不很好备课。有些教师现在还用好几年以前写的讲稿。有的人讲九十分钟课只准备半个小时，有的干脆不备课。
    教师中争名夺利，互相排斥，闹不团结的现象相当严重。几乎每个教研组都有闹不团结的事，采矿系七个教授之间都有纠纷。有些教师又进行同一题目的科学研究，不但不互相合作，反而互相拆台。由于教师之间不团结，不仅给教学和科学研究工作带来很大损失，还造成巨大的物质浪费。由于系与系之间、教研组与教研组之间闹纠纷，不肯互通有无，以致设备重复。冶金系四个专业实验室都设有化学分析室、暗室、金相室、天平室。
    在这些触目惊心的事实面前，教师们开始认识到了资产阶级思想危害之大，大家下决心一定要在这次运动中“脱胎换骨”，彻底改造。
