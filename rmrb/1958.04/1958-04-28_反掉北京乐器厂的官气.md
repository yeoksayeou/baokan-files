    Eliminate the Bureaucratic Air of the Beijing Musical Instrument Factory
    The bureaucratic air of the Beijing Musical Instrument Factory is too heavy. Our school has bought more than a dozen reed organs from this factory, but the quality is not high, and many reeds have broken. Last spring, we mailed these broken reeds to them, requesting replacement. As a result, a semester passed, and we didn't receive any replacements. We inquired at the post office, and they confirmed that the musical instrument factory had received the broken reeds. We wrote again to inquire, and they replied that the person handling this matter had been transferred, making it impossible to investigate. They asked us to provide another detailed list. However, after we sent the list, several months have passed, and it's still like a stone sinking into the sea, with no response. This kind of bureaucratic air in the Beijing Musical Instrument Factory must be eliminated.

    反掉北京乐器厂的官气
    北京乐器厂的官气太重。我们学校前后在这个厂买了十几架风琴，因为质量不高，音簧断了很多。去年春天，我们把这些断簧由邮局寄给他们，要求调换，结果一学期过去了，没给我们换来。我们到邮局去查问，证明乐器厂已经收到断簧了。我们又去信催问，他们回信说办这件事的人已调动工作，无法查清，要我们再开清单。但是，我们开去清单又是几个月了，仍然是石沉大海，没有回音。北京乐器厂这种官气必须反掉。
