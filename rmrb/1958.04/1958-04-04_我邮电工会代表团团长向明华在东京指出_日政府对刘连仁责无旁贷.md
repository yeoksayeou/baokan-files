Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd. News: The Central Committee of the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union held a banquet on the evening of the 2nd to welcome the visiting delegation of the Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, which is currently visiting Japan. Liu Lianren, a Chinese compatriot currently in Tokyo, was also invited to attend the banquet.

Xiang Minghua, head of the Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union delegation, after the banquet, expressed his sympathy to Liu Lianren on behalf of the Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union and 24 million Chinese workers, and presented him with a consolation payment of 50,000 Japanese yen.

Xiang Minghua then held a press conference. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Japanese non-governmental organizations and overseas Chinese in Japan for their concern and assistance to Liu Lianren. Xiang Minghua pointed out that the Japanese government should be responsible for compensating Liu Lianren and his family for the suffering they have endured. However, the Japanese government has not made any statement on the issue of its responsibility in the Liu Lianren incident, which is unacceptable to the Chinese people.

Xiang Minghua said that it is extremely reasonable to demand that the Japanese government acknowledge the fact that it illegally abducted Liu Lianren and be responsible for sending him back to China. Xiang Minghua expressed the hope that the Japanese people would support this reasonable demand.

At the press conference, Liu Lianren expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Xiang Minghua and the Chinese working class for their concern and assistance. Liu Lianren also stated that he would absolutely not leave Japan until the Japanese government clearly indicated that it would be responsible for handling his case. The Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union delegation is taking a train to the Kansai region today for a visit.

    我邮电工会代表团团长向明华在东京指出
    日政府对刘连仁责无旁贷
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本全递信工会中央委员会在2日晚间设宴欢迎正在日本访问的中国邮电工会访日代表团，目前在东京的中国难胞刘连仁也应邀出席了宴会。
    中国邮电工会访日代表团团长向明华在宴会结束以后，代表中国邮电工会和二千四百万中国工人慰问了刘连仁，并且赠送他慰问金五万日元。
    向明华接着举行了记者招待会。他对日本民间团体和旅日华侨对刘连仁的关怀和援助表示衷心的感谢。向明华指出，日本政府应该负责补偿刘连仁和他的家属所遭受的痛苦。但是，日本政府对它在刘连仁事件上所应负的责任问题至今没有任何表示，这是中国人民所不能容许的。
    向明华说，要求日本政府承认它非法掳走刘连仁的事实并且要它负责把刘连仁送回中国，这是极为合理的事情。向明华表示希望日本人民支持这种合理的要求。
    刘连仁在记者招待会上，对向明华和祖国工人阶级对他的关怀和援助表示衷心的感谢。刘连仁还表示，在日本政府没有明确表示将负责处理他的事件以前，他绝对不离开日本。中国邮电工会访日代表团今天乘火车去关西地方进行访问。
