    Zhejiang Handicraft Cooperatives and Supply & Marketing Cooperatives Launch Competition
    Manufacture More New-Style Farm Tools, Supply More Means of Production
    (Reported by this newspaper) To serve the great leap forward in agriculture and support the great revolution in cultivation systems and cultivation techniques, a friendly competition has rapidly unfolded among the handicraft industry federations and supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties and cities of Zhejiang Province. This competition was initiated by the Pinghu County Handicraft Industry Federation and Supply & Marketing Cooperative. After Pinghu County's proposal was published in the newspaper on March 28, seventy-four units throughout the province responded enthusiastically in one day. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party publicly commended the proactive spirit of the Pinghu County Handicraft Industry Federation and Supply & Marketing Cooperative in supporting agriculture.
    Taking on the task of farm tool innovation, manufacturing more and better new farm tools and improved farm tools to support agricultural production, is the overall goal of the competition proposed by the Pinghu County Handicraft Industry Federation. The handicraft workers of this county guarantee: to rush-produce 20,000 hand-cranked mud carriers before April 20, so that the whole county can use mud carriers instead of manual mud carrying; to imitate 10,000 Shandong-style iron cultivators, a new type of mud digging tool; to completely convert all of the county's existing 14,000 old-style waterwheels into more advanced closed waterwheels before May 20, and to produce 300 three-purpose (wind power, animal power, human power) waterwheels before April 20, to ensure that farmers can use new-style waterwheels to irrigate fields during spring plowing; to strive to achieve mechanization of vehicles and boats throughout the county within the year, deciding to manufacture 1,200 new agricultural boats and 5,000 various small carts, both single-wheeled and double-wheeled, and to rush to complete 500 small carts before April 20; and before the harvest of continuous cropping early rice, to imitate 1,000 continuous cropping harrows that can both plow and harrow the soil, basically replacing the iron harrows that can only plow the soil and the collapsing harrows that can only harrow the soil.
    The Handicraft Industry Federation of this county adheres to the principle of serving agricultural production and has overcome the difficulties of low technical level and backward equipment in recent years, striving to innovate farm tools. When encountering technical difficulties that cannot be solved, they visit teachers everywhere and send people to Shanghai, Hangzhou and other places to visit and study; if the equipment is insufficient, they adopt many poor and indigenous methods. In more than four years, they have created, imitated and improved more than 3,000 kinds of new farm tools and tools, which have been welcomed by farmers. The federation is now able to design and manufacture relatively complex power machinery, and has equipment such as lathes, drilling machines, planers, milling machines, electric sawing machines, and has established a foundry workshop.
    The total operating volume of means of production of the Pinghu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative this year will double the actual supply last year, and it has been decided to prepare most of the goods before the spring plowing. The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives in the whole county guarantee to work hard for twenty days from now on, organizing the digging of 100 million dan of river mud to support the needs of spring plowing production, and at the same time, guaranteeing to promote 1,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows before spring plowing, and organizing the transfer of 2,500 head of draught cattle.

    浙江手工业社供销社展开竞赛
    制造更多新式农具  供应更多生产资料
    本报讯　为农业大跃进服务、支援耕作制度和耕作技术大革新的友谊竞赛，已经在浙江省各县市的手工业联社、供销社之间迅速展开。这个竞赛是由平湖县手工业联社和供销社发起的。平湖县的倡议3月28日在报上发表后，一天之间，全省就有七十四个单位热烈响应。中共浙江省委公开表扬了平湖县手工业联社和供销社支援农业的主动精神。
    挑起农具革新的担子，制造更多更好的新农具和改良农具支援农业生产，是平湖县手工业联社倡议竞赛的总的努力目标。这个县的手工业工人保证：在4月20日前赶制二万台手摇运泥机，使全县都能用运泥机代替人工运泥；仿制新型掘泥工具山东式铁耖一万把；在5月20日前将全县现有的一万四千部旧式水车，全部改装为比较先进的封闭式水车，另外在4月20日前生产三用（风力、畜力、人力）水车三百台，以保证农民在春耕时能用新式水车灌田；努力促使全县在年内实现车船化，决定制造新农船一千二百只和独轮、双轮各种小车五千部，在4月20日前突击制成五百部小车；在连作早稻收割前，仿造又能翻土又能耙田的连作耙一千台，基本上代替只能翻土的铁耙和只能耙田的坍耙。
    这个县的手工业联社坚持为农业生产服务的方针，几年来克服了技术水平较低和设备落后的困难，努力革新农具。遇到技术上的疑难问题不能解决的时候，他们就到处拜师，派人到上海、杭州等地参观学习；设备不够，就采取了许多穷办法和土办法。四年多中，他们创造、仿制和改良了三千多种新式农具和工具，受到了农民的欢迎。这个社现在已经能够设计和制造比较复杂的动力机械，并且有了车床、钻床、刨床、铣床、电动锯木机等设备和设立了铸工工场。
    平湖县供销合作社今年的生产资料经营总额将比去年供应实绩翻两翻，并决定在春耕前准备好大部分货源。全县的供销社干部保证从现在开始苦战二十天，组织挖掘河泥一亿担，支援春耕生产的需要，同时在春耕前保证推广双轮双铧犁一千部，组织调剂耕牛二千五百头。
