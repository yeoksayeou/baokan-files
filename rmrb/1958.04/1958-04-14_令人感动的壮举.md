A Moving Feat
By Our Staff Commentator

    The determination of Albert Bigelow and three other ordinary Americans to protest the U.S. government's continued nuclear weapons testing with their own lives is a moving feat in the struggle for peace.

    Since the Soviet Union took the lead in unilaterally halting nuclear weapons testing, peace-loving people of all countries had hoped that the U.S. and British governments would follow suit, so as to finally move towards fundamentally eliminating the threat of the nuclear arms race. However, the U.S. government stubbornly insists on continuing its nuclear arms race policy and refuses to stop nuclear weapons testing. This is the most blatant provocation against the peace aspirations of people of all countries. People of all countries are responding to this provocation by the U.S. government with a powerful protest movement. In this tide of protest, the actions taken by Albert Bigelow and three other ordinary Americans are a powerful blow to the U.S. nuclear arms race policy. Although they are only four people and one small boat, they represent the will of thousands upon thousands of good American people.

    The U.S. government's intimidation of these four Americans with arrests and punishments demonstrates the government's frenzy and shamefulness. However, the will of peace warriors is unbreakable; Albert Bigelow and the other three, disregarding the U.S. government's intimidation, are determined to sail towards the U.S. nuclear weapons testing area in the Pacific. The spirit of Albert Bigelow and the other three in resolutely fighting for peace is enough to make the U.S. government, which is keen on nuclear arms race policies, tremble.

    The "Golden Rule" is carrying the peace aspirations of the American people and is surging forward in the Pacific. Hundreds of millions of people around the world are following it with their hearts, and hundreds of millions of eyes are watching it. The courageous actions of Albert Bigelow and the other three will inspire thousands upon thousands of peace-loving people to fight more resolutely against the U.S. government's nuclear arms race policy.

    令人感动的壮举
    本报评论员
    艾伯特·比格劳等四个普通的美国人，决心以自己的生命来抗议美国政府继续进行核武器试验，这是一个使人感动的争取和平的壮举。
    由于苏联率先单方面停止了核武器的试验，各国爱好和平的人民本来是期望美英政府能够继起效法，以便最后走向根本消除核军备竞赛的威胁。但是，美国政府却顽固地要继续执行它的核备战政策，因而不肯停止核武器试验。这是对各国人民和平愿望的最粗暴的挑衅。各国人民以强大的抗议运动来回答美国政府的这种挑衅。在这个抗议的怒潮中，艾伯特·比格劳等四个普通的美国人所采取的行动，是对美国核备战政策的一个有力打击。他们虽然只有四个人和一艘小艇，但是他们所代表的却是千千万万的美国善良人民的意志。
    美国政府以逮捕和惩处来恐吓这四个美国人，这表现了这个政府的狂暴和可耻。但是，和平战士的意志是不可夺的；艾伯特·比格劳等四个人不顾美国政府的恐吓，决心要驶向美国在太平洋的核武器试验地区。艾伯特·比格劳等四个人所表现的这种为和平而坚决斗争的气概，足以使热衷于核备战政策的美国政府为之战栗。
    “金律号”载着美国人民的和平愿望正在太平洋鼓浪前进。全世界亿万人的心跟随着它，亿万人的眼睛注视着它。艾伯特·比格劳等四个人的勇敢行为，将鼓舞千千万万的爱好和平的人们更坚决地为反对美国政府的核备战政策而斗争。
