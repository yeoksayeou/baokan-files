    Both Go Out and Rectify
    Yi Huai
    If a "scholar" doesn't go out, he won't know the world's affairs; if leading comrades don't leave their offices, they will be ignorant and isolated. If they don't go to the grassroots, don't personally experience the vigorous spirit of the Great Leap Forward, and don't personally listen to the opinions and voices of the working people, it will be difficult to thoroughly criticize their own wrong thoughts and work styles, the rectification will not be deep or thorough, and the pace of the leap forward will be difficult to take a big step. When leading comrades go out, obtain rich firsthand materials, solve problems in practical work, and listen to opinions from all sides, they will both promote work and advance rectification. Therefore, to carry out rectification well, one must go out more often.
    However, one principle must be adhered to: both go out and rectify. The method of rectifying without going out is not good, and the method of going out without rectifying must also be opposed. Going out is for the sake of rectification, but going out cannot replace rectification after all. Leading comrades going out certainly has the benefits mentioned above, but it cannot solve all the major problems in rectification. For example, the revision of rules and regulations, the improvement and reform of leaders' thinking and work styles, the formulation of leap forward targets and measures, etc., these are not things that any one leader can solve alone. Leaders going out creates good conditions for solving these problems, but to thoroughly solve these problems, we must, on the basis of concentrating the opinions and situations from above, below, left, and right, carry out large-scale airing of views, big contending, and big debates with leadership, and finally propose solutions.
    Is it possible to both go out and rectify? It is possible! Many units have already done so. Generally, there is more than one or two leaders in a unit. Some are sent out, and some lead the rectification at home. This is not a very difficult thing in itself, but some units have neglected this point. Some units of the central government agencies have this phenomenon. They only care about going out, but ignore rectification. Although one or two leaders are left in the agency, they cannot take the "command" to lead the rectification movement. In these units, the rectification movement has become a loose and disorganized phenomenon of "a bird cannot fly without a head." It seems that this is just a specific issue of work arrangement. Some units may think that it is the same to grasp the leadership after the leaders come back? In fact, it is not the same! To do work, one must seize the opportunity. When the double-anti movement forms a climax and the enthusiasm of the masses is high, the leaders abandon everyone; when the tide recedes and the enthusiasm of the masses cools down, the leaders turn back to re-mobilize, it will be a case of getting half the result with twice the effort.

    既要出门，又要整风
    易槐
    “秀才”不出门，难知天下事；领导同志不走出办公室，就要耳目蔽塞孤陋寡闻。不到基层，不亲自接触生龙活虎般的大跃进气势，不亲自听取劳动人民的意见和呼声，就很不容易彻底批判自己的错误思想和作风，风就整得不深不透，跃进的步伐就难以跨得很大。领导同志出了门，取得了丰富的第一手原料，解决了实际工作中的问题，听取了各方面的意见，就既促进了工作，又推动了整风。因此，要整好风，就一定要多出门。
    可是，也必须坚持一个原则，就是：既要出门，又要整风，整风不出门的办法不好，出门而不整风的办法也要反对。出门为了整风，出门可也毕竟不能代替整风。领导同志走出门去固然有前面谈到的那些好处，但无论如何不可能解决整风中的一切重大问题。比如规章制度的修改，领导思想作风的提高和改进、跃进指标、措施的制定等等，这些就都不是哪一个领导者个人所能单独解决的。领导者出门，为解决这些问题创造了好条件，而要彻底解决这些问题还得在集中上下左右的意见和情况的基础上，有领导地大鸣大放大争大辩，最后才能提出解决方案。
    既要出门又要整风，办不办得到呢？办得到！很多单位已经这样办了。一般单位的领导人总不只一个两个，一些人派出门去，一些人在家领导整风，这本来并不是什么很困难的事情，可是，有些单位却偏偏忽略了这一点。中央国家机关有些单位就有这种现象，他们只顾出门，却忽视了整风，机关中虽也留下一个或两个领导人，可是他们却挂不起领导整风运动的“帅”来。在这些单位里整风运动就成了“鸟无头不飞”的松懈涣散现象。看来这只是一个工作安排的具体问题，有些单位也许觉得等领导人回来之后再来抓紧领导不也一样吗？其实，是不一样的！做工作要抓时机，当双反运动形成高潮，群众热情正在高涨的时候，领导者把大家抛下不管；潮退了，群众的热情冷了，领导者再回过头来重新发动，就要事倍功半了。
