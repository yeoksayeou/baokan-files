Everyone Should Care About Transferred Cadres

    Is Going to the Countryside Just for Labor?

    Like Comrade Yu Zhiming, I grew up in an exploiting-class family. After starting work, I struggled to figure out how to reform myself, but I couldn't find a good way. Since being transferred to the countryside, I have deeply realized that participating in labor is the most fundamental way to reform all non-proletarian thoughts (but it doesn't mean that as long as you labor, you will be reformed).

    At the beginning of my time in the countryside, I first resolved to work hard and learn production knowledge from labor practice, so that I could become a new type of farmer with culture and agricultural knowledge. Generally speaking, I have basically achieved this, and I have also gained some ideological benefits, which Comrade Yu Zhiming has already experienced. But does this mean that I have achieved the goal of reform? Does it mean that I have been reformed? According to my experience, working hard does not necessarily mean that one's thinking has been reformed well. Here are a few examples to illustrate this. Although I have been in the countryside for more than five months, I deeply felt at a meeting to struggle against rich peasants that I lacked the clear class feelings of love and hate that poor and lower-middle peasants have. On the contrary, I even had the wrong idea that the struggle methods could be eased. Secondly, after the Party put forward the slogan of realizing the Forty Articles of the National Programme for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule, a surging great leap forward wave was set off in the countryside. Men, women, old and young in the countryside were actively working under the frozen sky and in the cold wind, day and night, but I was still haggling over personal holidays, as if I had not been inspired.

    From my thoughts and performance, relying solely on working hard is not enough to comprehensively and thoroughly transform one's thinking. Therefore, I disagree with Comrade Yu Zhiming's view that labor is the only way to transform intellectuals. I believe that directly participating in actual labor is a basic method of reforming a person, but it is not the only method. How well one labors can be used as a measure of whether a person is willing to reform, but it is not the only measure.

    上山下乡只是为了劳动吗？
    我和余志明同志一样是在剥削阶级家庭里长大的，参加工作以后对如何改造自己的问题曾经苦思过，但是没有摸到一个比较好的改造的途径。下放以来我深深体会到参加劳动锻炼是改造一切非无产阶级思想的最基本的途径（但不是说只要劳动，就会把自己改造好）。
    下放之初我思想上首先认定要努力劳动，从劳动实践中学习生产知识，使自己成为一个有文化、有农业知识的新式农民。这一点一般说自己基本上做到了，也取得了一些思想上的收获，这是余志明同志已经体会到了的。但是这样是否就算达到了改造的目的了呢？是否就算改造好了呢？根据我的体会，劳动得好并不等于思想也改造得好。这里我举几个例子说明一下。我来农村锻炼虽然已有五个多月，但在一次斗争富农的会上，自己深深感觉到缺乏贫雇农那样爱憎极其分明的阶级感情，相反的还曾经浮现过斗争方式是否可以缓和一些的错误思想。其次在党提出提前实现农业发展纲要四十条的口号以后，农村掀起了汹涌澎湃的大跃进浪潮，农村中男女老幼都在冰冻和寒风中披星戴月地积极劳动，而我却还在斤斤计较个人休假日，好像没有受到什么鼓舞似的。
    从我的这些想法和表现来看，光靠劳动得好，是不能全面彻底地改造思想的。所以我不同意余志明同志认为劳动是改造知识分子的唯一办法的观点，我认为直接参加实际劳动锻炼是改造一个人的基本方法，但不是唯一的办法。劳动的好坏，可以做为衡量一个人是否愿意改造自己的尺度。但不是唯一的尺度。
