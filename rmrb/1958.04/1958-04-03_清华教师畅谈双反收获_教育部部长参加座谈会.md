    Tsinghua Teachers Discuss Gains from "Double-Anti"
    Minister of Education Attends Symposium

    (Our dispatch) Tsinghua University professors recently held three consecutive symposiums to freely discuss their gains in the "Double-Anti" movement. Everyone opened their hearts to the Party and their comrades and proposed "Red and Expert" plans. Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng and Vice Minister Huang Songling attended the symposiums. The ideological barriers that had existed among the professors for many years were broken down; those who had never spoken out in previous movements also engaged in self-criticism and criticized others; and many professors expressed self-criticism from the depths of their hearts.

    At the symposium, Professor Zhang Mingtao, director of the Department of Electrical Engineering, said: "I want to thank the Party. Without this 'Double-Anti' movement, I would not be able to enter socialism. My thoughts were usually very hidden, even my wife didn't know. I was always afraid of exposing my thoughts. For example, when giving reports, I always had to write a draft, and what I said was not from my heart. Regarding the Party's policies, I would do what I agreed with, and if I disagreed, I would keep silent, doing as little as possible and avoiding doing anything if I could. In the past, I also wanted to take the socialist road, but I always felt out of place. My ideological baggage grew heavier from the "Three-Anti" to the rectification movement. This time, I am determined to throw it away."

    Professor Wu Zhonghua, deputy director of the Department of Power Machinery, talked about how the "Double-Anti" movement made him truly realize the significance of "politics is the soul." During the few years since he returned to China, he always felt that although politics was important, it was not easy to learn all at once, so he might as well try to work hard in his professional field first. He said that facts had proven that this was a dead end. Because he was not "red" enough, although he subjectively wanted to contribute to socialist construction, he was either going in the wrong direction or using the wrong methods. In the work of the teaching and research group, I still worked according to the old methods I used in the United States. As a result, the teaching plans we made were seriously divorced from the socialist front, and the various bourgeois ideas of the teaching and research group members and students were greatly developed, and the specific teaching work and laboratory work were not done well either. He said that the big-character posters woke him up. Even in the specific work of teaching and scientific research, being "red" is more important than being "expert." Without being "red," one cannot become an "expert."

    Liang Sicheng, director of the Department of Architecture, went to see the big-character posters as soon as he returned from abroad. He felt that the watermelon tasted bitter at first, but the more he ate, the sweeter it became, and the nutrition was very rich. He felt that he had been feeling particularly listless in recent years, and the reason was complacency in politics and inferiority in professional skills. He said: "After the anti-rightist movement, I thought I was already 'completely red' politically, and I became more and more complacent. In fact, my ideological understanding was still very vague. At the same time, after the criticism of architectural thought, I was very inferior in my professional skills." He examined that after the criticism of architectural thought, he was still nostalgic for the past, like a bowl, only a piece was broken, and he still felt that it could be used. Because it was not completely broken, a new direction has not been established in his work for several years.

    Minister Yang Xiufeng said at the end of the meeting that people who came from the old society must undergo a serious test. After the successive movements since liberation, everyone can generally clearly recognize the distinction between the enemy and ourselves, but there are still problems in viewpoints and methods. Viewpoints and methods will affect the position under certain circumstances. Bourgeois individualism and socialism are contradictory. If they are not eliminated, it will be difficult to take the socialist road. Transforming oneself requires relying on the masses. One's own transformation and improvement are limited. If there are shortcomings, one must have the determination to correct them. With determination, there will be confidence; with confidence, there will be courage; with courage, there will be strength. Yang Xiufeng finally said that it is very right for everyone to conduct self-criticism first. At the same time, if there are disagreements with the opinions raised in the big-character posters, they can also be discussed to improve together. President Jiang Nanxiang also asked everyone to speak freely. He said that when eating watermelon, one can also spit out the seeds, and any inappropriate opinions can also be raised for discussion and mutual exchange.

    At the meeting, Liu Xianzhou, Liang Sicheng, and fourteen other professors jointly proposed an outline for formulating personal "Red and Expert" plans. They suggested that all teachers in the school formulate "Red and Expert" plans.

    清华教师畅谈双反收获
    教育部部长参加座谈会
    本报讯　清华大学的教授们最近连续举行了三次座谈会，畅谈双反中的收获。大家向党交心，向同志交心，并提出了红专规划。教育部部长杨秀峰、副部长黄松龄参加了座谈会。教授们多年来存在的思想隔阂冲开了；在历次运动中从来不发言的，这次也自烧烧人；很多教授从自己的内心深处发出了自我批评的声音。
    在座谈会上，电机系主任章名涛教授说：“我要感谢党，没有这次双反运动，我是不能进入社会主义的。我的思想平时很隐蔽，连爱人也不知道。我时常怕自己的思想暴露出来，如作报告总要写好稿子，说的不是心里话。对党的政策，我同意的照做，不同意的就闭口不言，能少做的少做，能不做的就不做。自己过去也想走社会主义道路，但总是格格不入。我的思想包袱从三反背到整风，越背越重，这次决心把它丢掉。”
    动力机械系副主任吴仲华教授谈到，双反运动使他真正认识到“政治是灵魂”的意义。他在回国的几年中，总觉得政治虽然重要，但一下子不容易学会，不妨先尽量在专业方面努力工作。他说，事实证明这是行不通的道路。由于不红，虽然有主观愿望要对社会主义建设作出贡献，但不是方向不对，就是方法不对。在教研组的工作中，我仍旧按照以前在美国时的老方法进行工作，结果订出的教学计划严重地脱离了社会主义战线，教研组成员和学生的各种资产阶级思想得到了大大发展，具体的教学工作、实验室工作也没有做好。他说，这次大字报把我打醒了，就是在教学和科学研究的具体工作中，也是红比专更重要，不红也就专不了。
    建筑系主任梁思成刚从国外回来，一到学校就去看大字报。他感到，西瓜吃起来先是苦的，但后来越吃越甜，营养非常丰富。他觉得自己近年来暮气特别严重，原因是在政治上的自满和业务上的自卑。他说：“反右以后，我自以为政治上已经‘通红’了，越来越自满，实际上我的思想认识还很模糊。同时，在建筑思想批判以后，我在业务上很自卑。他检查自己在建筑思想批判以后，还留恋过去，好像一个碗，只打破了一个口，还感到可以用。由于没有彻底地破，几年来自己的工作中新的方向就一直没立起来。
    杨秀峰部长在会议结束时讲话说，从旧社会过来的人要经过严重的考验。经过解放以来历次运动，大家对敌我界限一般的可以认识清楚，但观点和方法上还存在问题。观点和方法在一定情况下就会影响立场。资产阶级个人主义和社会主义是矛盾的，不破除就很难走社会主义的道路。改造自己要依靠群众，一个人自己改造提高是有限的。有了缺点，就要有决心改正。有决心，就有了信心；有信心，就有了勇气；有勇气，就有了力量。杨秀峰最后说，大家首先进行检查是非常对的，同时，对大字报所提意见有不同意的地方，也可以商榷，以便共同提高。蒋南翔校长也要求大家畅所欲言。他说吃西瓜也可以吐西瓜子，有不合适的意见，也可以提出来讨论，互相交心。
    会上有刘仙洲、梁思成等十四位教授联名提出了一项制订个人红专规划的纲要，他们建议全校教师都来制订红专规划。
