Xinhua News Agency report: The All-Indonesia Central Trade Union issued a statement on the 30th, calling on workers in factories, plantations, mines, and docks to strongly condemn the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and its activities of interfering in other countries' internal affairs.

The statement demanded that the Indonesian government immediately take measures to close the institutions of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group in Indonesia. The statement said that members of the Chiang Kai-shek group, with the help of the United States, have infiltrated many groups and cultural and economic departments. They are also helping the rebel groups to disrupt the Indonesian economy.

Jakarta newspapers have continued to reveal a large number of facts about the Chiang Kai-shek group's subversive activities in Indonesia in recent days.

These newspapers pointed out that many specially trained military personnel from the Chiang Kai-shek group have illegally infiltrated Indonesia and are hiding in the banks, schools, and newspaper offices opened by the Chiang Kai-shek group in Indonesia. For example, Ma Shuli, the head of the "Chung Hwa Shang Pao," was once a general in Chiang Kai-shek's Third War Zone and the head of the Shangrao concentration camp, and he slaughtered countless Chinese patriots; Cai Yumei (transliteration), the manager of "Ta Tung Bank," was formerly Chiang Kai-shek's provincial police chief; many former military personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek group hold important positions in the Siriwangi Bank in Jakarta. Yang Weibin, a shareholder of this bank, is a major foreign exchange smuggler and is currently imprisoned.

    要求封闭蒋帮机构

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：全印度尼西亚中央职工会在30日发表声明，号召工厂、种植园、矿山和码头的职工强烈谴责东南亚条约组织和它干涉别国内政的活动。
    声明要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取措施，封闭在印度尼西亚的台湾蒋介石集团的机构。声明说，蒋介石集团分子在美国的帮助下已经渗入许多团体和文化经济部门。他们还帮助叛乱集团扰乱印度尼西亚的经济。
    雅加达报纸最近几天来继续揭露蒋介石集团分子在印度尼西亚进行颠覆活动的大量事实。
    这些报纸指出，许多受过特务训练的蒋介石集团的军人已经非法潜入印度尼西亚，并且隐藏在蒋介石集团在印度尼西亚开设的银行、学校和报馆里面。例如，“中华商报”的负责人马树礼就曾经是蒋介石的第三战区的将领和主持上饶集中营的特务头子之一，并且屠杀过无数的中国爱国者；“大东银行”的经理蔡毓梅（译音），过去是蒋介石的省警察厅长；有许多前蒋介石集团的军人在雅加达的西里旺仪银行里担任重要职务，这家银行的股东杨伟彬是一个大的外汇走私犯，目前已经被监禁。
