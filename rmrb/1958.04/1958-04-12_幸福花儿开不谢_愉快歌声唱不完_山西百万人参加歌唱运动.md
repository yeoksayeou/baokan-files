Happy Flowers Bloom Without Withering, Joyful Songs Sing Without End
    Shanxi: Millions Participate in Singing Movement

    (Our Dispatch) Over one million people in Shanxi Province have joined the socialist singing movement.

    In this bright spring, in the rural areas of the Taihang and Lüliang Mountains, and the Jinzhong and Jinnan plains of Shanxi Province, songs praising happy life and reflecting the struggle for production are flying everywhere – on streets, in dining areas, on construction sites, and in the fields. The "Spring Plowing Song" sung by farmers in Siping, Hedong, and Taoyuan villages in Zuoquan County contains lines like: "Rapeseed flowers are yellow and bright, everywhere is a beautiful spring scene, the village bell rings, commune members go to the fields for work." After work, Han Laosan and Wang Mangui, two old men from the Banyu Agricultural Cooperative in the same county, do the Yangko dance and sing, "Everyone for one, one for everyone... we will build the agricultural cooperative like a flower." In Licheng County, where people universally sang "Shoulder the red-tasseled spear and fight the little devils" during the Anti-Japanese War, people are singing again. Seventy thousand people in the county can now sing five new songs. At the Zhangbei Canal construction site in this county, over eight thousand commune members sing while ramming the earth, "The canal water flows eastward, with a rushing sound, fruit trees line the banks... when the Zhangbei Canal is built, it will irrigate 60,000 mu of land, heave-ho, heave-ho, let's work harder, and achieve 400 jin per mu!" In Anyanggou Village in Xiyang County in the Taihang Mountains, songs are often heard in recent days. The farmers compose and sing themselves: "The Communist Party has brought us justice, we are full and warm after collectivization, happy flowers bloom without withering, joyful songs sing without end." The village has organized many family singing teams and sisters-in-law singing teams.

    People in various places are very enthusiastic about learning and singing songs. More than 10,000 singing teams have been organized throughout the province. Some young people in Hansue Township, Wanrong County, have been learning to sing songs every night at the club since late December last year. They have learned 22 new songs such as "Run Cooperatives Well in Every Village" and "Rural Youth Shock Brigade". Xing Chouhua, a farmer singer in Shuangbao Village, Xin County, has taught more than 70 people to sing during the singing movement. Under her instruction, all members of Xing Chouhua's family, young and old, have learned to sing. People call her family a happy family. Shi Kehui, a member of the Anyanggou Agricultural Cooperative in Xiyang County, practices singing musical scores while herding sheep on the mountain during the day. Now he can read musical scores and sing, and he can also coach a singing team. The long tobacco pipe in his hand has become a baton.

    The singing movement in Shanxi Province began gradually last year. Party, government, and cultural departments at all levels have attached great importance to leading the development of the movement. Various places have also mobilized a large number of intellectuals and cadres in the countryside to teach farmers to sing. The cultural centers of various counties encourage and guide farmers to compose and sing themselves, supply songs, and help farmers establish singing team organizations and cultivate musical backbones.

    Xinhua News Agency reported that the Shanxi Province Rural Cultural Great Leap Forward Conference was recently held in Xiyang County, where rural cultural work is active. More than 400 attendees, including directors of cultural and educational bureaus from various special areas, counties, and cities, cultural center cadres, directors of rural clubs, and activists in cultural and recreational activities, visited the cultural activities of the rural clubs in Xiyang County and exchanged more than 50 advanced experiences such as carrying out the socialist singing month and running clubs frugally in Wanrong and other counties.

    The Xiyang County CPC Committee personally grasps cultural work and adopts a method that combines large-scale and small-scale, cultural and artistic activities with political activities, decentralization with centralization, and fields with stages, making rural cultural work very active and becoming a driving force for the masses to promote production. The representatives attending the conference clarified the direction of rural mass cultural work through visits and exchanges of experiences, believing that cultural activities should be closely integrated with politics and production, and activities should be carried out in small and diverse forms, so that mass artistic activities can be rich and colorful.

    Under the slogan of learning from Xiyang, catching up with Xiyang, comparing with the advanced, and competing in enthusiasm, the representatives are determined to usher in a great leap forward in mass cultural work this year.

    幸福花儿开不谢　愉快歌声唱不完
    山西百万人参加歌唱运动
    本报讯　山西省已有一百多万人参加了社会主义歌唱运动。
    在这春光明媚，一片春耕的山西省太行、吕梁山区、晋中、晋南平原的农村里，街头、饭场、工地、田间，处处飘飞着歌颂幸福生活和反映生产斗争的歌曲。左权县寺坪、河东、桃园等村的农民唱的“春耕曲”中有这样的句子：“油菜花儿黄又黄，到处一片好春光，村前钟声响叮当，社员出工上田庄。”这个县板峪农业社社员韩老三和王满贵老汉在放工后，扭着秧歌，唱着“大家为一人，一人为大家，……要把农业社建设的像花”。在抗日战争时期普遍会唱“扛起红缨枪，去打小东洋”的黎城县群众，现在又唱起歌来了。全县已有七万人会唱五支新歌。在这个县的漳北渠工地上，八千多个社员一边打夯，一边唱着“渠水向东流，哗啦啦的响，沿岸果树排成行，……修成漳北渠呀！浇地六万亩呀，咳呀，咳哟，大家加油干呀，亩产四百斤呀”，劳动效率也大大提高了。太行山里的昔阳县安阳沟村里，近些日来，常常是歌声四起。农民们自编自唱道：“共产党来了哟见青天，合作化后哟饱又暖，幸福的花儿开不谢，愉快的歌声哟唱不完。”这个村组织了许多家庭歌咏队和妯娌歌咏队。
    各地群众学歌、唱歌的劲头很足，全省已组织了一万多个歌咏队。万荣县汗薛乡社有的青壮年从去年12月下旬到现在，每晚都在俱乐部学唱歌曲。学会了“村村办好合作社”“农村青年突击队”等二十二个新歌曲。忻县双堡村农民歌手邢丑花在歌唱运动中，教会了七十多人唱歌。邢丑花全家男女老幼在她的教唱下都学会了唱歌。人们称她家是欢乐的家庭。昔阳县安阳沟农业社社员史克会白天上山放羊时练唱简谱，现在已能看简谱唱歌，而且还能教练一个歌咏队，他手里的长烟袋已成为指挥棒了。
    山西省歌唱运动还是在去年陆续开始的。各地党、政、文化部门十分重视领导运动的开展。各地还动员了大批在乡知识分子、干部给农民教唱。各县文化馆鼓励和辅导农民自编自唱，供应歌曲；并帮助农民建立歌咏队组织和培养音乐骨干。　（水天生）
    据新华社讯　山西省农村文化跃进大会最近在农村文化工作活跃的昔阳县召开。出席大会的四百多名各专县市文教局长、文化馆干部、农村俱乐部主任、文娱活动积极分子，参观了昔阳县农村俱乐部的文化活动，交流了万荣等县开展社会主义歌唱月、勤俭办俱乐部等五十多项先进经验。
    昔阳县的中共党委亲自抓文化工作，采取了大型与小型相结合、文化艺术活动与政治活动相结合、分散与集中相结合、田间与舞台相结合的办法，使农村文化工作开展得很活跃，成为群众推动生产的动力。出席大会的代表通过参观、交流经验，明确了农村群众文化工作的方向，认为文化活动应与政治、生产密切结合，同时以小型多样的形式开展活动，群众的文艺活动就能够丰富多采。
    代表们在学昔阳、赶昔阳、比先进、比干劲的行动口号下，决心要在今年群众文化工作上出现一个跃进局面。
