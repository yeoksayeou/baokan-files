    The Revolutionary Path of Intellectuals
    ——A Review of the Novel “Song of Youth”
    Wang Shide
    Since the May Fourth Movement, Chinese intellectuals have been an important force in the revolutionary movement. Our Party has always attached importance to mobilizing intellectuals to participate in the revolutionary struggle. At the same time, the Party places even greater emphasis on helping intellectuals raise their revolutionary consciousness, integrate with workers and peasants, transform their ideology, and play a greater active role.
    The novel “Song of Youth” (by Yang Mo, published by Writers Publishing House in January 1958) is set against the turbulent era from the “September 18th Incident” in 1931 to the “December 9th Movement” in 1935, and depicts the magnificent Beijing student movement. Under the leadership of the Party, most intellectuals awakened and embarked on the revolution; a few people sank and betrayed the revolution. The author enthusiastically sings the praises of revolutionary intellectuals who dedicated themselves to the nation and the revolution, powerfully lashes out at the cowardly and vulgar dregs, and the despicable and shameful traitors; at the same time, it also meticulously portrays the awakening process of some honest and kind, but confused, good people. Reading this novel can give us education and encouragement, making us know what to learn, what to abandon, and how to choose our own path. For the vast number of intellectuals who are enthusiastically exploring the path of being both red and expert today, this novel has even stronger practical significance.
    The novel focuses on depicting the growth process of the heroine Lin Daojing on the revolutionary path, and prominently praises her valuable revolutionary qualities. Lin Daojing is the daughter of a big landlord. Her father robbed a tenant's daughter to be his concubine, who gave birth to her, and then drove her mother out of the house. She lived with servants since she was a child. When she grew up, she was forced to marry a rich old man, so she ran away. Society is darker than family, and everywhere are man-eating demons. If one is unwilling to compromise and surrender, and unwilling to swallow insults and be a plaything of the reactionary class, one cannot survive in the old society. Lin Daojing has cultivated a valuable rebellious character since she was a child; when she was lonely and helpless, she would rather commit suicide by jumping into the sea than live in humiliation. Yu Yongze, a student at Peking University, saved her. She thought he was an honest and kind person, and married him. However, she gradually discovered that Yu Yongze's honesty and kindness were limited. He did not abandon the landlord class's position, and still wanted to take the road of serving the reactionary class. Lin Daojing was unwilling to live this meaningless parasitic life. She gradually understood: only by joining the revolution, seeking the leadership of the Communist Party, and fighting for the emancipation of the hundreds of millions of poor people, can one become a truly independent person. At that time, her married life was still affluent; it was not easy to break the inertia of being content with this petty-bourgeois life and the remaining affection for Yu Yongze. However, the humiliation she suffered since childhood gave her strength. Lu Jia Chuan, a progressive youth she knew, guided her to participate in the anti-Japanese and national salvation parades, and read Marxist social science books; these sowed seeds in her heart, igniting a fire of determination to break with Yu Yongze and consciously demand revolution. No one asked her to, but she herself, without guidance, hid the revolutionary leaflets that Lu Jia Chuan had left with her for a long time and hadn't picked up, secretly posting them on the streets and alleys in the dark of night at the risk of danger, and tried every means to secretly mail them everywhere. This heroic and intelligent action came entirely from her revolutionary nature in her blood. This initiative to consciously engage in practical struggle is commendable. Although she is not yet mature, it does not matter, as long as she always insists on her conscious revolutionary demands, the struggle will cultivate her to be experienced. A person who can persist in the revolution and fight independently without the guidance of superiors and the supervision of comrades basically possesses the qualities of a trustworthy revolutionary. This quality enables her to move firmly from hesitation and doubt to revolution, allows her to find the Party, enables her to endure torture in prison, and enables her to gradually grow to understand revolutionary tactics; to understand that revolution is a long-term, arduous, and complex struggle; to abide by iron organizational discipline, to work diligently, to be highly vigilant; to understand that the work of mobilizing intellectuals in colleges and universities is also important. Therefore, she is no longer naive and honest with the enemy, no longer yearns for a stormy life; she eliminated the ideological style of being ungrounded and uneasy about ordinary work. Later, she was responsible for the Party's work at Peking University. Although there were only three Party members there, and some students still regarded her as a spy, and she was in a situation of no contact with her superiors for a long time, and her clothes were almost pawned off, and she only ate two sesame cakes every day, she still persisted in the struggle. We can clearly see that Lin Daojing at this time is much more experienced and mature, and has grown up greatly. Through the depiction of Lin Daojing, the novel strongly shows that: the basic key and determining factor for a person to embark on the revolutionary road, to persist unyieldingly in the enemy's prison, under cruel torture, and in all kinds of dangerous situations, and to be trained into a mature revolutionary is the conscious revolutionary demands and tenacious revolutionary will.
    Of course, this revolutionary demand and tenacious will are also cultivated in struggle. People are members of society, and social unrest will inevitably touch everyone; everyone must express their attitude towards current politics. The increasingly sharp struggle and the deep suffering of the people will eventually prompt every upright person to embark on the revolution; however, some awaken earlier, and some awaken later. Jiang Hua, Lu Jia Chuan, and Luo Dafang in the novel are those who awaken early and awaken resolutely. They recognized the laws of social development, recognized the political situation at that time, resolutely put down their books, and threw themselves into the struggle, went to factories and mines to organize and encourage workers to make revolution, went to the army to participate in battles, thoroughly integrated with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and became thorough revolutionaries. This is the best example for intellectuals. In fact, why don't they want to study hard? The problem is, what's the use of studying in that kind of environment? Lin Daojing's experience answered very clearly and powerfully. These young people participated in the revolution not because they felt they had special talents in political work, but because they realized they had a responsibility, which produced a strong revolutionary demand. At that time, some confused good people believed that their talents were not suitable for engaging in politics, and burying themselves in books was the way to serve the motherland with real talent and learning. In reality, they did not recognize the situation, did not stand on the revolutionary position of the people, and did not have strong political enthusiasm and a sense of civic responsibility; that kind of confused view was actually beneficial to the enemy. Of course, they often go through a winding path, receive lessons from facts, and after suffering some hardships, they will also awaken and embark on the revolution. The novel truly portrays the awakening process of such a person. Professor Wang Hongbin, at first, also advocated "studying more problems and talking less about doctrines," telling his daughter to bury herself in books and not to meddle in politics; later, the corruption of the Kuomintang and the non-resistance to Japanese aggression gradually awakened him, and he felt that young people could not be confined to their studies anymore; the reality made himself also urgently demand to read Marxist books and abandon Hu Shi's "study to save the country" theory. He said, "There are ninety-year-old youths in the world, and there are also twenty-year-old old men. My mind is made up, please don't say anymore!" He left his glasses, keys, etc. at home, and participated in the demonstration with the determination to leave and not return. How touching this is. His daughter, Wang Xiaoyan, initially listened to her father's words, believing that: studying is the most important thing, and she was unwilling to interfere in political "idle affairs"; what does socialist Soviet Union have to do with us; engaging in revolution is dangerous, what future is there? She is an innocent and naive girl who doesn't know the ways of the world, but she has a pure and kind heart. Therefore, when she heard that there are still landlords harming farmers in the world, she was so excited that she cried, and realized that there were still many things in the world that she didn't know. So she started reading social science books, and gradually developed revolutionary demands. However, innocent and kind people will encounter more severe tests in the complex reality. She fell in love with Dai Yu, a renegade who appeared with a "leftist" face. Dai Yu told her that Lin Daojing was a traitor to the Party; Lin Daojing also told her that Dai Yu was a traitor to the Party. What to do? One is a lover, one is a good friend, who exactly is the liar? It needs to be judged by herself. Here, the novel is written very movingly; how dangerous a wrong path a person will take if they are politically confused, not sensitive, and not red enough! Of course, because her essence is beautiful, she finally saw through Dai Yu and became a fully awakened brave fighter, but she had already gone through a painful road. Li Huaiying, the "flower queen" of Peking University, is a girl with a sense of justice, but she also has many confused ideas. She believes that "good people don't form parties", politics is a competition for fame and fortune, she hates the "scheming and infighting" of parties, she says that even if the Japanese really occupy Beiping, they may not dare to damage the dignified world-renowned university. Later, the Japanese army occupied Beiping and brutally insulted her. The ruthless facts finally made her change. Although the cruel reality finally awakened her, what a painful price she had paid!
    The Kuomintang reactionaries often use revolution as "unnecessary sacrifice" to blur young people's pursuit of progress. The novel powerfully refutes this fallacy with the actual life experiences of many characters. Lin Daojing's old classmate Chen Weiru accepted this ideological poison, and truly became an "unnecessary sacrifice"; she said that people should always be practical, so she married a bank deputy manager, and later committed suicide because her husband had a new love. There is also Bai Liping, who also talked about revolution at first, and later became a "star". She said: "Which intellectual from a petty-bourgeois background hasn't gone through this period of fantasizing about revolution! But later, in the face of the facts, I gradually understood, gradually became sober - it's good, but it's too far and too vague...." "To go to jail, to be beheaded, fortunately not to be arrested, it is also some iron discipline,... so I turned my head.... Life is just like this, fleeting, let's enjoy ourselves." The novel clearly points out that in the face of reality, there are two kinds of "sobriety"; Bai Liping, from fantasizing about revolution to willingly becoming a plaything of the reactionary class, her "sobriety" compared with Lin Daojing's sobriety, is really living in a drunken dream, truly making herself an unnecessary sacrifice. Through Xu Ning, another typical character who truly wants revolution but lacks determination, the novel also shows that: from fantasizing about revolution, being willing to revolutionize to becoming a completely sober and determined revolutionary, there is still a distance in the middle of this road, which needs to go through painful tempering and self-ideological struggle. Xu Ning, wants to make revolution, but is afraid of hardship and danger; he speaks very nicely, but he is not very energetic when he does things. He thought of joining the army in the Northeast, but he couldn't bear to part with his mother, lover, and studies. The enemy's prison educated him: to make revolution, one must make a decision, the sooner the decision is made, the better, the stronger the better, the more determined the better, the more thorough the better.
    The novel also describes the different paths taken by Luo Dafang and Yu Yongze, two intellectuals from exploiting class backgrounds, and correctly shows that: people from exploiting class backgrounds can also completely embark on the revolutionary road. The fundamental key is whether they have conscious revolutionary demands and whether they are willing to abandon the exploiting class position and transform themselves. Luo Dafang's father was a high official in the Jiang regime. He wanted to send him to study in the United States or Japan and forbade him to associate with the Communist Party, lest he end up on the guillotine. But he recognized the true faces of his father and Hu Shi, these American Ph.D.s, and resolutely abandoned his wealthy and noble family to join the Chahar Anti-Japanese Allied Army. Yu Yongze, on the other hand, not only couldn't bear to give up Luo Dafang's opportunity to study in the United States, but also tried his best to use Luo Dafang's relationship to get to know Hu Shi, hoping that Hu Shi could appreciate his paper on textual research of national antiquities and gain a way to climb up. He said nice things on the surface, saying that he also loved the country, and that he wanted to sort out China's national heritage and save the country in his own way. He put up the signboard of Hu Shi's "study to save the country" theory, put on a long robe, which was considered a "national form", and devoted himself to reading thread-bound books all day long, entangled with ancient people and old versions, which was considered sorting out the "national quintessence", which was considered "seeking the Tao while sitting". What is this "Tao" serving? To put it bluntly, it can also be said to be "learning for application", but it is only for his own use and for the reactionary class. He said to the tenants, "If you tenants don't pay rent, what money will my father use to send me?" This fully exposed his unwillingness to abandon the landlord class's position! He said to Lin Daojing, what can a pale-faced scholar do with bare hands! I haven't seen a few revolutionary young masters who shout slogans go down to the coal mine; it's better to study, a person has to start a family and establish a career, it's better to take a steady path; if you wear a red hat, you will be beheaded. This completely exposed his exploitative class individualistic position! Yu Yongze had some advantages of being honest and enthusiastic in the early stage, but as the times developed, he was unwilling to completely abandon the exploiting class position and the individualistic outlook on life that bourgeois education had cultivated for him. Then he inevitably became a tool of the reactionary class and became the dregs of the times along with the "national essence-ism".
    Due to space limitations, it is not possible to make a comprehensive and in-depth review of the entire book here. However, judging from the main outlines drawn so far, "Song of Youth" can profoundly and essentially reflect the faces and changes of various intellectuals in the turbulent era, not only leaving a vivid and concrete shadow for history, which can have important cognitive significance for future generations, but also has realistic educational significance for the vast number of intellectuals we want to transform today. From a higher perspective, I feel that the novel also has shortcomings: it does not reflect the overall face of the era and the struggle of the Beiping underground Party clearly enough; it fails to specifically outline the transformation process of Jiang Hua, Lu Jia Chuan and other intellectuals into revolutionary and mass figures; there are still some places where the transformation process of many kind and confused good people is not described in enough detail; the personality and language of the characters are not vivid enough; and so on. These may be difficult to demand perfection from this novel, because a novel always has aspects that are emphasized, and there are also aspects that must be simplified, and therefore it is difficult to take care of everything. Then, let's put this forward as a reference opinion, as a hope for similar works that may be produced in the future.

    知识分子的革命道路
    ——评长篇小说“青春之歌”
    王世德
    五四以来，中国知识分子在革命运动中，是一个重要的力量，我们党一向重视发动知识分子参加革命斗争。同时，党更重视帮助知识分子提高革命觉悟，与工农结合，改造思想，发挥更大的积极作用。
    小说“青春之歌”（杨沫著，作家出版社1958年1月出版）以1931年“九·一八”到1935年“一二·九”这个大动荡时代为背景，写出了波澜壮阔的北京学生运动。在党领导的学生运动中，大多数知识分子觉醒了，走向革命；也有少数人沉沦下去，叛变了革命。作者热情地歌颂了为民族为革命奋不顾身的革命知识分子，有力地鞭挞了怯弱庸俗的渣滓和卑劣可耻的叛徒；同时还细致地表现了一些正直善良、然而糊涂的好人的觉醒过程。读了这本小说，能给我们教育和鼓舞，使我们知道应该学习什么，抛弃什么，怎样选择自己的道路。对于今天正在热烈探求又红又专道路的广大知识分子，这本小说有更为强烈的现实意义。
    小说着力描写了女主人公林道静走上革命道路的成长过程，突出地歌颂了她可贵的革命品质。林道静是一个大地主的女儿。她父亲把佃户的女儿抢来做姨太太，生下了她，又把她母亲驱逐出门。她从小和仆人在一起住，长大了，被逼嫁给阔老，她就逃出来。一个小学校长收留了她，却又阴谋把她介绍给县长做姨太太。社会比家庭更黑暗，到处是吃人的魔鬼。假如不愿妥协投降、忍气吞声做反动阶级的玩物，在旧社会就活不下去。林道静从小就养成了一种可贵的反抗性格；当她孤苦无依、伸手无援的时候，宁愿投海自杀，也不愿屈辱苟生。北京大学学生余永泽救了她。她以为他是个正直善良的好人，和他结合了。可是，她逐渐发现余永泽的正直善良很有限度，他没有放弃地主阶级立场，还是要走为反动阶级服务的道路。林道静不愿意过这种没有意义的寄生生活。她逐渐明白：只有投身革命，寻找共产党的领导，去为千千万万穷苦人民的翻身而斗争，才能成为一个真正独立的人。当时，她婚后的生活还富裕；要打破安于这种小康生活的惰性和对余永泽残存的爱怜感情，并不是容易的。但是，从小受到的屈辱给了她力量。她认识的进步青年卢嘉川，又引导她参加了抗日救国的游行，读了马克思主义社会科学书籍；这些，在她的心里撒下了火种，使她烧起了坚决和余永泽决裂、自觉要求革命的大火。谁也没有要求她，是她自己在无人指导的情况下，把卢嘉川藏在她那里、很久没来取走的革命传单，一个人在黑夜里冒着危险偷偷地张贴在街头巷尾，又想尽办法偷偷地寄发到各处去。这种英勇、智慧的行动，完全出之于她血液里要求革命的本性。这种自觉地投入实际斗争的主动性是难能可贵的。虽然，她还不成熟，不过，这不要紧，只要永远坚持自觉的革命要求，斗争会把她培养得老练起来的。一个人在没有上级指导、同志督促的情况下，能够坚持革命，独立作战，就基本上具备了可以信赖的革命者的品质。这种品质，使她能够从徬徨、犹豫，坚定地走向革命，使她找到了党，使她能够忍受狱中酷刑，使她逐渐成长懂得革命策略；懂得革命是长期、艰苦、复杂的斗争；要遵守铁的组织纪律，要埋头苦干，要高度警惕；懂得了在大中学校发动知识分子的工作也是重要的。于是，她不再对敌人天真老实，不再向往狂颷式的生活；她清除了不踏实、不安心于平凡工作的思想作风。到后来，她负责北大党的工作，虽然那里只有三个党员，有的同学还把她当成特务，而她又处在和上级久无联系的情况下，衣物也快当完，每天只吃两个烧饼，仍能坚持斗争。我们清楚地看到，林道静这时，已经老练成熟得多了，大大成长了。小说通过对林道静的描写，强烈地表明了：一个人能够走上革命道路，在敌人的监狱中、酷毒的苦刑下，在万种艰险的情况里，能够坚持不屈，锻炼成为一个成熟的革命者，其基本关键和决定因素是自觉的革命要求和顽强的革命意志。
    当然，这种革命要求和顽强意志也是在斗争中培养起来的。人是社会的一分子，社会的动荡终必触及每一个人；每一个人都必须对当前政治表示态度。日益尖锐的斗争，人民深重的苦难，终究会促使每一个正直的人走向革命；不过，有的觉醒得早些，有的晚些。小说中的江华、卢嘉川、罗大方，就是觉醒得早、觉醒得坚决的。他们认识了社会发展规律，认清了当时的政治局势，毅然放下书本，投入了斗争，到工厂矿山去组织和鼓动工人革命，到军队去参加战斗，彻底和工农兵结合，成为彻底的革命者，这是知识分子最好的榜样。其实，他们又何尝不想好好读书呢，问题是读了书在那种环境中，有什么用。林道静的遭遇很清楚很有力地作了回答。这些青年人参加革命，并非由于感到自己在政治工作上有特殊的才能，而是意识到自己有责任，才产生了强烈的革命要求。当时，有些糊涂的好人认为自己的才能不适合搞政治，埋头书本才是用真才实学去为祖国服务，实际是没有认清局势，没有站在人民的革命立场，没有强烈的政治热情和公民责任感；那种糊涂观点实际上是对敌人有利的。当然，他们往往走过一段弯路，受到事实的教训，吃了一些苦头之后，也会觉醒过来，走向革命的。小说真实地表现了这样一种人的觉醒过程。王鸿宾教授，起初也主张“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”，叫他女儿埋头读书，不要过问政治；后来国民党的腐败，对日本侵略的不抵抗，使他逐渐惊醒，觉得青年无法关在书斋里了；现实使他自己也迫切要求阅读马克思主义书籍，抛弃胡适的“读书救国论”。他说“世界上有九十岁的青年，也有二十岁的老头呢。我的主意已定，请君不必多言！”把眼镜、钥匙等都留在家里，以出而不归的决心去参加游行示威了。这是多么使人感动。他女儿王晓燕，最初听从父亲的话，认为：读书是最要紧的，不愿管政治“闲事”；社会主义苏联和我们有什么关系；搞革命危险，有什么前途。她是个不知世事、天真烂漫的姑娘，但她心地纯洁善良，因此当她听说世界上还有地主残害农民的事情，就激动得哭了，才知道世界上还有许多她不知道的事物，于是她看起社会科学书籍来，逐渐产生了革命要求。然而，天真善良的人在复杂的现实里还会碰到更多严酷的考验。她爱上了一个以“左”的面孔出现的叛党分子戴愉。戴愉对她说，林道静是党的叛徒；林道静也告诉她，戴愉是党的叛徒。怎么办？一个是爱人，一个是好朋友，到底谁是骗子？需要自己裁判。这里，小说写得很动人；一个人在政治上糊涂，不敏锐，不红透，就会走上多么危险的歧路！当然，由于她本质美好，后来终于识破了戴愉，成为完全觉醒的勇敢战士，然而已经多走了一段痛苦的道路。北大的“花王”李槐英是个有正义感的姑娘，但也有着很多糊涂思想，她认为“好人不党”，政治就是争名夺利的角逐场，她讨厌党派的“勾心斗角”，她说日本人真占了北平，也不见得敢损害堂堂世界知名的学府。后来，日军占了北平，强暴地污辱了她，无情的事实终于使她转变过来。虽然残酷的现实终于使她觉醒，但已付出了多么痛苦的代价！
    国民党反动派常常用革命是“无谓的牺牲”，来模糊青年人对进步的追求。小说以很多人物的实际生活遭遇有力地驳斥了这种谬论。林道静的老同学陈蔚如就是接受了这种思想毒素，才真做了“无谓牺牲品”的；她说人总要实际些，就嫁了一个银行副理，后来因为丈夫另有新欢，自杀了。还有那个起初也谈过革命的白莉苹，后来做了“明星”。她说：“小布尔乔亚出身的知识分子，哪个没经过这个幻想革命的时期呀！可是后来，在事实面前我渐渐明白啦，渐渐清醒啦——那好是好，可是看的太远、太渺茫啦。……”“要坐牢，要杀头，幸而不被捕，也是什么铁的纪律呀，……于是我回过了头。……人生不过如此，过眼云烟，得乐且乐吧。”小说鲜明地指出，在现实面前，有两种“清醒”；白莉苹从幻想革命到心甘情愿做反动阶级的玩物，她这种“清醒”和林道静的清醒相比，实在是醉生梦死，真正使自己成了无谓的牺牲品。小说通过另一种真愿革命但决心不足的典型人物许宁，又表现了：从幻想革命、愿意革命到成为完全清醒的坚决的革命者，这条道路中间也还有一段距离，需要经过痛苦的磨练和自我思想斗争。许宁，又想革命，又怕艰苦危险；他讲起话来，挺漂亮，可是办起事情来就不大带劲了。他想到东北参军，但又舍不得妈妈、爱人、学业。敌人的监狱教育了他：要革命，就要下决心，这决心下得越早越好，越强越好，越坚决越好，越彻底越好。
    小说还写出了罗大方和余永泽这两个都是剥削阶级出身的知识分子所走的不同道路，正确地表明了：剥削阶级出身的人也完全可能走上革命道路，根本的关键还是有没有自觉的革命要求，肯不肯放弃剥削阶级立场，改造自己。罗大方的父亲是蒋政权的大官，要把他送到美国或日本留学，不许他和共产党来往，免得上断头台。但是他认清了他父亲和胡适这些美国博士的真面貌，坚决丢弃荣华富贵的家庭，参加到察北抗日同盟军去。余永泽呢，他不但舍不得放弃罗大方那种留学美国的机会，还竭力想通过罗大方的关系认识胡适，希望胡适能赏识他的考证国故的论文，获得一个向上爬的门路。他口头上说得很好听，说他也是爱国的，他要整理中国民族遗产，以自己的形式来救国。他打起了胡适的“读书救国论”的招牌，穿起长袍，算是“民族形式”，整天全神贯注地读线装书，和古人、旧版本纠结在一起，算是整理“国粹”，算是“坐以求道”。他这个“道”是为什么服务的呢？拆穿来看，也可以说是“学以致用”的，不过是为他自己用、为反动阶级用罢了。他对佃户说“你们佃户都不交租，我父亲拿什么钱寄给我？”就充分暴露了他不愿放弃地主阶级的立场！他对林道静说，白面书生，赤手空拳，顶什么事！还没见过几个喊口号的革命少爷下煤窑的；还是读书好，一个人要成家立业，还是走稳当点的路好；戴上了红帽子，要杀头的。这就完全暴露了他剥削阶级个人主义的立场！余永泽在早期还有些正直热情的优点，但随着时代的发展，他不肯彻底抛弃剥削阶级立场和资产阶级教育给他养成的个人主义人生观，那就不可避免地成为反动阶级的工具，和“国粹主义”者一同成为时代的渣滓。
    限于篇幅，这里不能对全书作全面深入的评述。不过，就从现在勾出的一些主要轮廓来看，“青春之歌”能深入本质地反映了大动荡时代中各种知识分子的面貌和变化，不单给历史刻下了生动具体的面影，对后代能有重要的认识意义，而且对今天我们要求改造的广大知识分子，也有现实的教育意义。从较高的要求来看，我觉得小说也还有不够之处：对于当时整个时代面貌和北平地下党的斗争情况，反映得还不够清晰；江华、卢嘉川等知识分子革命化、群众化的改造过程没能具体地勾出一个轮廓；很多善良糊涂的好人的转变过程中还有写得不够细致的地方；人物的个性和语言还不够鲜明；等。这些，也许是很难对这部小说求全要求的，因为一部小说总有写得着重的方面，也有必须简略、因而很难照顾周全的方面。那末，就把这当作参考意见提出来，算是对将来可能产生的同类作品的希望。
