Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Electric Dispatch: For six years, Wang Yazhuang Village, Wanrong County, Shanxi Province, has persisted in implementing the "Love the Country, Love the Commune Day" system. The socialist consciousness of the peasants has been continuously improved, and all work has shown a vigorous development trend.

“Love the Country, Love the Commune Day” is an effective method for conducting socialist education among peasants and for the masses to conduct self-education. On the 1st of every month, Wang Yazhuang carries out dual-love day activities. All the peasants gather together to check the whole village and individual’s situation of loving the country and the commune according to the public pledge, and conduct research and debates on many major issues, thereby improving everyone's socialist consciousness.

After the autumn of 1957, the commune members launched a debate at a dual-love day meeting on the issue of whether to return the state’s 50,000 yuan cotton prepayment. Some advocated repaying it in one lump sum, while others advocated delaying repayment, reducing the amount, or not repaying it at all. Finally, when everyone realized that "taking advantage of the state" was not honorable, and that they should "repay what they borrowed," and that they could not violate the interests of the state for personal gain, they decided on the spot to reduce each workday's distribution by 26 cents, and to repay the 50,000 yuan owed to the state in full.

The commune members also debated issues such as who suffers from low labor quality and whether it is right to not care for public property at the dual-love day meeting, which strengthened their concept of loving the commune as their home.

The Love the Country, Love the Commune Day meeting is also a meeting for the peasants' socialist life. Good people and good deeds are often commended at the meeting, and bad people and bad deeds are criticized, and criticism and self-criticism are carried out. The model figures who are commended include those who love the country and the commune, are diligent and thrifty, pay attention to hygiene, and have harmonious families. Those who are criticized include the breeder who fed the plow cattle poorly. The commune members are very interested in doing so. They said: The dual-love day is fair in rewards and punishments, everyone shoulders the burden of loving the country and the commune, and good deeds and bad deeds cannot be hidden from the public, so there is no worry that the commune will not be run well. The commune members also happily said: The Party has Party Day, the League has League meetings, and the commune members are having a socialist life meeting.

Dual-love day is also a good opportunity to launch socialist competitions. Many of Wang Yazhuang’s work and production activities, such as digging wells in the fields and turning dry land into paddy fields, were completed by mobilizing and organizing peasants through dual-love day.

Wang Yazhuang's dual-love day activities are carried out in conjunction with regular political and ideological work. The village’s thirty-six propagandists often contact the masses to understand the situation, which greatly helps to have a good dual-love day. In addition, the Party organization of Wang Yazhuang also pays attention to using forms such as clubs, blackboards, street allegro, and reading newspapers to conduct regular political education among the peasants, in coordination with dual-love day activities.

Due to the persistent dual-love day activities, all work is led by politics. Since 1952, Wang Yazhuang has been rated as a model village for well-digging, a model village for propaganda networks, a model village for literacy, a model club, and a model credit cooperative by the special district and county. This village has always completed the state's grain and cotton purchase tasks and military service tasks very well. The agricultural cooperative is very solid. In the past five years, no commune member has withdrawn from the cooperative, and there have been no adverse phenomena such as livestock deaths, theft, or embezzlement. The commune members often maintain full labor enthusiasm. The whole village has seen six major new and good trends: love for the country, love for the commune, love for labor, thrift and diligence in managing the household, abiding by the law, and concern for current political affairs. Among them, the most prominent is the strong political atmosphere and the high revolutionary enthusiasm of everyone. People in neighboring villages praise Wang Yazhuang as: good cadre style, high mass consciousness, model work, and many good people and good deeds.

    王亚庄坚持“爱国爱社日”制度六年如一日
    群众觉悟高　工作样样好
    新华社太原电　山西省万荣县王亚庄六年来坚持实行“爱国爱社日”制度，农民的社会主义觉悟日益提高，各项工作都呈现出蓬勃发展的景象。
    “爱国爱社日”是向农民进行社会主义教育，也是群众进行自我教育的有效方法。每月1日，王亚庄都进行双爱日活动，全体农民集合在一起，根据公约检查全村和各人的爱国爱社情况，对许多重大的问题，进行研究和辩论，从而提高了大家的社会主义觉悟。
    1957年秋后，社员们在一次双爱日会上，对于是否归还国家的五万元棉花预定金问题，展开辩论。有的主张一次还清，有的主张迟还、少还或不还。最后，当大家认识到“揩国家的油”不光荣，应该“有借有还”，不能因为个人利益而违背国家利益以后，当场决定每个劳动日少分两角六分，把欠国家的五万元如数归还。
    社员们还在双爱日会上，辩论过劳动质量低谁吃亏、不爱护公共财物对不对等问题，增强了爱社如家的观念。
    爱国爱社日会议，还是农民的社会主义生活会议，会上经常表扬好人好事，批评坏人坏事，展开批评和自我批评。受到表扬的有爱国爱社、勤俭节约、讲卫生、家庭和睦等多方面的模范人物。被批评的有喂坏耕牛的饲养员等人。社员们对于这样做很感兴趣，他们说：双爱日赏罚严明、人人担起爱国爱社担子，好事坏事哄不过众人，社就不愁办不好。社员们还高兴地说：党有党日，团有团会，社员过的是社会主义生活会。
    双爱日还是发动社会主义竞赛的良好时机。王亚庄的许多工作和生产活动，如打地头井、变旱地为水地等，就是经过双爱日发动和组织农民来完成的。
    王亚庄的双爱日活动同经常性的政治思想工作结合着进行。全村三十六个宣传员，经常联系群众，了解情况，对过好双爱日帮助很大。另外，王亚庄的党组织还注意运用俱乐部、黑板报、街头快板、读报等形式，向农民进行经常的政治教育工作，配合双爱日活动。
    由于坚持进行双爱日活动，各项工作都由政治统率，王亚庄从1952年以来，先后被专区、县评为打井模范村、宣传网模范村、扫盲模范村、俱乐部模范和信用社模范。这个村，历年来完成国家粮棉征购任务和兵役任务都很好，农业社很巩固，五年来没有一户社员退社，没有发生过牲口死亡、偷盗、贪污等不良现象，社员们经常保持着饱满的劳动热情。全村出现了爱国、爱社、热爱劳动、勤俭持家、遵守法律和关心时事政治等六大新的良好风气。其中，最突出的是政治空气浓厚，人人革命热情高涨。邻村人夸奖王亚庄是：干部作风好，群众觉悟高，工作称模范，好人好事多。
