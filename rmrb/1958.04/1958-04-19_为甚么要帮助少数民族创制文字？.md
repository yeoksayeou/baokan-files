Why Help Minority Nationalities Create Writing Systems?
Chen Shunyi

Why should we help minority nationalities create writing systems? Not everyone may understand this question. For example, some people think: Under the leadership of the Party, all nationalities in the country have united into a free and equal national family, jointly building socialism; then, the minority nationalities without writing systems can solve the writing problem by learning Chinese, and further improve their scientific, technological, and cultural levels through Chinese. Why start all over again and create new writing systems?

This question should be clarified. First of all, helping minority nationalities create writing systems is an important task in implementing the Party's nationality policy. The Communist Party of China implements a policy of equality for all nationalities, and the Constitution stipulates that "all nationalities have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages." In order to ensure that the people of minority nationalities effectively exercise the rights granted by the Constitution, it is necessary to create conditions for them, help nationalities without writing systems create writing systems, and help nationalities with incomplete writing systems reform their writing systems.

Second, helping minority nationalities create writing systems can more quickly promote the development of cultural and educational undertakings in ethnic areas. In carrying out the elimination of illiteracy and the development of primary education in ethnic areas, it is more effective to have a writing system that is compatible with the national language. Taking the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region as an example, before the Zhuang language was promoted, Zhuang children in schools had to use Chinese textbooks to learn. Teachers taught Chinese in Zhuang, but the grammatical structure and basic vocabulary of Zhuang language are different from Chinese, which makes teaching and learning difficult. Some Zhuang primary school teachers once reflected on this difficulty, saying: "Teaching one word for half a day, both teachers and students blink, go home and speak Zhuang, and Chinese characters are forgotten." Because what is learned and what is spoken are different, Zhuang children have to spend two more years in primary school to reach the learning level of Han children. However, in the first year that Guangxi gradually promoted the Zhuang language, because the writing and language were consistent, and it was alphabetical phonetic, by the end of last year, 400,000 people had participated in the study, and more than 100,000 people had been freed from illiteracy. Comparing before and after, the necessity of creating writing systems for minority nationalities is very clear.

Third, the creation of national writing systems also helps the development of other construction undertakings in ethnic areas. Some minority nationalities have to use rice straws to record work points and burn iron bars red to punch holes in wooden boards to keep accounts because they do not have writing systems. It can be estimated that if writing systems are created, it will be of great help to the management and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives in these ethnic areas. From this example, it can be seen the promoting effect of creating writing systems on other construction undertakings in ethnic areas.

Fourth, creating writing systems for minority nationalities can facilitate the people of minority nationalities to learn Chinese, and further improve their scientific, technological, and cultural levels; at the same time, it also facilitates the Han people to learn the languages of minority nationalities. Because after minority nationalities have writing systems representing their own languages, they can compile dictionaries of their own languages and Chinese, and compile phonetic readers and grammar outlines using the method of comparing their own languages and Chinese. With these learning tools, whether the people of minority nationalities learn Chinese, or the Han people learn the languages of minority nationalities, the learning effect can be improved many times over. The intercommunication of languages and writing systems can promote cultural exchange between nationalities and further strengthen national unity.

From the above analysis, the simple idea that the minority nationalities without writing systems can solve the writing problem by learning Chinese is obviously wrong. Of course, after the whole world realizes communism in the future, as a result of long-term cooperation among all nationalities in economic, political, and cultural aspects, a common international language and a writing system adapted to this language will eventually be merged. However, this is first and foremost premised on the gradual integration of the original languages and writing systems of all nationalities in the process of development. It is precisely in order to achieve this great goal that it is necessary today to do a good job in the arduous and complex task of helping minority nationalities create writing systems.

    为甚么要帮助少数民族创制文字？
    陈舜裔
    为甚么要帮助少数民族创制文字？对这个问题，可能还不是人人都了解的。例如有的人就认为：全国各民族在党的领导下，已经团结成为一个自由平等的民族大家庭，共同建设社会主义；那末，没有文字的少数民族学会汉文就解决了文字问题，并且通过汉文还可以进一步提高科学技术和文化水平，何必另起炉灶，再创文字？
    这个问题应该说清楚。首先，帮助少数民族创制文字，是贯彻执行党的民族政策的一项重要工作。中国共产党实行各民族一律平等的政策，宪法中规定“各民族都有使用和发展自己的语言文字的自由”。为了保证少数民族人民有效地行使宪法所给予的权利，就须要给他们创造条件，帮助没有文字的民族创制文字，帮助文字不完备的民族改革文字。
    第二，帮助少数民族创制文字，可以更快地促进民族地区文化教育事业的发展。在民族地区进行扫除文盲和发展初等教育，有了和民族语言相适应的文字就收效更快。以广西僮族自治区为例，在没有推行僮文以前，僮族儿童在学校里只好用汉文课本学习。教师用僮语教汉文，但是僮语的语法结构和基本词汇与汉语不同，教和学都感困难。曾经有僮族小学教师反映这种困难说：“一字教半天，师生都眨眼，回家讲僮话，汉字丢一边。”由于学的和说的不一样，僮族儿童在小学中要多费两年光阴才能达到汉族儿童的学习水平。但是广西在逐步推行僮文第一年，由于文字和语言一致，又是字母拼音，到去年年底已有四十万人参加学习，有十多万人已摆脱文盲状态。前后对比，为少数民族创制文字的必要就十分清楚了。
    第三，民族文字的创制，还有助于民族地区其他各项建设事业的发展。有些少数民族由于没有文字，他们组织的农业社就不得不使用稻草秆来记工分，用铁条烧红在木板上通孔的办法来记帐。可以估计，如果创造了文字，对这些民族地区农业社的管理和巩固是有很大作用的。从这一个例子，也就能够看出创制文字对民族地区其他建设事业的促进作用了。
    第四，替少数民族创制文字，可以便利少数民族人民学习汉语汉文，进一步提高他们的科学技术和文化水平；同时也便利汉族人民学习少数民族的语言。因为少数民族有了代表自己语言的文字以后，可以编写本族语言和汉语对照的词典，用本族语言和汉语比较的方法编写语音读本和语法纲要；有了这些学习工具，不论少数民族人民学习汉语汉文，或汉族人民学习少数民族语言，学习效果都可以提高很多倍。语言文字的互通，可以促进民族间的文化交流，进一步加强民族团结。
    从以上的分析看来，那种认为没有文字的少数民族学会汉文就解决了文字问题的简单想法，显然是错误的。当然，在将来全世界都实现共产主义以后，各民族在经济、政治和文化方面长期合作的结果，最后将融合出一种共同的国际语言，以及和这种语言适应的文字。但是，这却首先是以各民族原有语言文字在发展过程中逐步融合为前提的。正是为了实现这个伟大的目的，今天才需要做好帮助少数民族创制文字这件艰巨复杂的工作。
