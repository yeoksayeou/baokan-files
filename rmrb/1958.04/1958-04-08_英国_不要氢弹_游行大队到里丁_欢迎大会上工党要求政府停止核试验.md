Xinhua News Agency, London, April 6th (Our Correspondent Qian Xing) - Today is Britain's coldest Easter in a century (even colder than last year's Christmas), but the people participating in the "Ban the Bomb" march have not flinched in the slightest. This contingent, which set out from London, has already marched for three days in inclement weather of rain and snow, and will arrive tomorrow at its destination – Aldermaston, the site of Britain's nuclear weapons research center.

Over fifteen hundred marchers arrived in Reading tonight. Although they were soaked to the skin, everyone was in high spirits. They were welcomed by a rally against the hydrogen bomb hosted by the Reading Labour Party organization at the Town Hall.

Ian Mikardo, Labour MP for Reading, welcomed the marchers. He said: The Reading Labour Party organization believes that the only moral and sensible policy is for Britain to unilaterally cease the testing, stockpiling, production, and use of nuclear weapons. He expressed dissatisfaction with the Labour Party's official policy for not being thorough enough in opposing the government's nuclear armament policy.

Mikardo also warned of the danger of the United States arming West Germany with nuclear weapons. He asked, "Can you still feel safe or sleep soundly when you know that West Germany possesses nuclear weapons?" "What right do we have to say to Germany that they cannot possess hydrogen bombs when we ourselves possess them? If we abandon this weapon, we can call on other countries to stop this madness."

Reverend Collins of St. Paul's Cathedral in London paid tribute to the marchers. He said that this march is an outstanding success and a most meaningful event. He asked the marchers to use their ideals to persuade their friends and neighbors. He reiterated that this march is only the beginning of the movement to strive for nuclear disarmament, and this movement must continue until its goal is achieved.

Peake, a construction worker from London who participated in the march with his whole family (including an eighteen-month-old baby), was still in the marching ranks today; his eleven-year-old son, Peter, rubbed his heel raw today, but is still insisting on participating in the march. Left-wing Labour MP, Swingler, brought his two children, twelve-year-old Claire and ten-year-old Oliver, to participate in the march.

    英国“不要氢弹”游行大队到里丁
    欢迎大会上工党要求政府停止核试验
    新华社伦敦6日电　本社记者钱行报道：今天是英国百年来最寒冷的复活节（比去年底的圣诞节还冷），但是，参加“不要氢弹”大游行的人们并没有丝毫畏缩。这支从伦敦出发的队伍已经在雨雪交加的恶劣天气中走了三天，他们将在明天到达游行的目的地——英国核武器研究中心所在地阿尔德马斯顿。
    一千五百多游行者今天晚上到达里丁，虽然他们全身都被雨淋湿了，但是大家的精神都非常愉快。他们受到了工党里丁党组织在市政厅主持的反对氢弹大会的欢迎。
    里丁工党议员伊恩·米卡多向游行者致欢迎词。他说：工党里丁党组织认为，唯一道德的和清醒的政策就是英国单方面停止试验、储藏、生产和使用核武器。他对于工党官方政策反对政府的核武装政策不彻底表示不满。
    米卡多对于美国用核武器武装西德的危险也提出了警告。他问道，“当你知道西德拥有了核武器的时候，你还能感到安全或睡得安稳吗？”“当我们自己拥有氢弹的时候，我们有什么权利对德国说，他们不能拥有氢弹？如果我们放弃这种武器，我们就能号召其他国家停止这种疯狂行动。”
    伦敦圣保罗大教堂的牧师柯林斯向游行者致敬。他说，你们这次游行是出色地成功和最有意义的事情。他要求游行者用自己的理想来说服自己的朋友和邻居。他再次强调，这次游行不过是争取裁减核军备运动的开始，这个运动必须继续进行下去，一直到达到目的时为止。
    全家都参加了游行的伦敦建筑工人培克和他的几个孩子们（包括一个十八个月的婴儿）今天仍然在游行队伍中；他的十一岁的儿子彼得今天把脚后跟磨破了，但是仍然在坚持参加游行。工党左翼议员斯文格勒带了他的两个孩子——十二岁的克莱尔和十岁的奥利佛参加游行。
