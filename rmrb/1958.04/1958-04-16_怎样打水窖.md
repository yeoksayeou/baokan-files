    How to Build a Water Cellar

    Water Cellar Site Selection and Construction Season

    When selecting a site for a water cellar, the first thing to consider is the soil quality. The cellar should be built in areas with thick layers of clay soil and clay loam. Sandy soil and sandy loam areas are not suitable. Secondly, pay attention to the water flow and terrain, and choose cellar sites where water converges or flows through, such as near road ditches, beside roads, below the water terraces of terraced fields, or beside the branch ditches connected to flood control ditches and contour ditches. If you want to build a water cellar in a larger plot of land, you should choose the outlet where water converges based on the slope of the terrain, and pay attention to building earth ridges along the edge of the land to purposefully intercept water so that it can flow into the water cellar, ensuring that the cellar is filled with water after rain. Building water cellars can be done during the winter slack season. Before the ground freezes hard, first select the cellar site and dig a one-meter-deep opening. After the ground freezes and other farm work cannot be done, continue digging. After the spring thaw, plaster the cellar walls, allowing the dug-out cellar walls a certain amount of time to air dry.

    Water Cellar Shapes

    In order to adapt to the terrain, soil conditions, and meet the requirements for irrigation and water storage, water cellar shapes can be divided into the following types:

    The first type is the "wine bottle-shaped water cellar" (as shown in the figure). The advantages of this type of water cellar are that it is strong, saves labor, is close to the ground, and is easy to fill. The disadvantage is that it has a small storage capacity.

    The second type is the "linked water cellar" (as shown in the figure). This type of water cellar consists of three "wine bottle-shaped water cellars," with the bottoms connected by pipes. This type of water cellar must have one cellar that is large and deep so that when water is drawn from one cellar, the water in the other cellars can also be fully utilized. This type of cellar has a large storage capacity and can be equipped with a waterwheel, but the disadvantage is that it takes up a lot of space.

    The third type is the "grape-shaped water cellar" (as shown in the figure). This type of water cellar has three or two openings added to the lower part of the body of a single wine bottle-shaped water cellar, forming round water storage caves, like grapes, hence the name grape water cellar. Its advantages are that it has a large storage capacity, takes up little space, saves labor and materials, and combines the advantages of both new and old water cellars. The disadvantage is that the water output is relatively small.

    The fourth type is the "horizontal cave water cellar" (as shown in the figure). This type of water cellar only has a cellar body of seven to ten feet, i.e., digging a cave from the side, and the cave is under a high cliff, so it is also strong and durable.

    The fifth type is the "boiler water cellar" (as shown in the figure). This type of water cellar is a development of the horizontal cave water cellar. The terrain for digging the cellar must be such that there is a piece of land outside and below the cellar, and the ground is lower than the cellar floor. A crock pipe is installed at the bottom of the cellar, connecting to the lower ground. When water is needed, opening the pipe will allow the water to flow out automatically without any other operation. It is a further improvement over the above types, but the terrain must be carefully chosen.

    Plastering the Water Cellar Walls

    The water cellar walls must be plastered in one go, and this should be done in the spring after the weather warms up. The materials for plastering the water cellar are generally white ash and dry red clay, mixed in a weight ratio of 1:3, and water is added to form a thick mud slurry. Plastering one water cellar requires approximately 600 to 800 catties of white ash and 1,900 to 2,400 catties of dry red clay. Before mixing, the dry red clay (mostly in块状) should be dried, rolled into powder, sieved, and then moistened with water, but not too much water should be added. The white ash should also be pre-slaked with water, and the stones and rock debris should be removed before using the mature lime slurry. Before plastering, make sure to sweep away the dust and loose soil from the surface of the cellar wall. When plastering, plaster from the bottom of the cellar wall upwards in circles, and complete it in one go. Where the cellar wall and the cellar bottom meet, it should extend more than a foot into the center of the cellar bottom, pressing it down when treading.

    The operation of plastering the water cellar is very simple, without any tools. Grab a handful of mud slurry and stick it to the cellar wall, and use the palm of your hand to rub it upwards, so that the mud slurry is closely combined with the cellar wall. The thickness of the mud slurry is generally about two inches. After plastering a part, you can gently tap it with a wooden mallet. If the plaster on the cellar wall sounds hollow when tapped, first break the plaster with your finger to release the air, gently press it with your hand, and then tap it again. The plastered cellar wall is generally more than one inch thick, and it makes a "dang dang" sound when tapped with a finger.

    Plastering the cellar opening and the cellar bottom is very important. The thickness of the mud slurry within two feet around the cellar opening should be about one foot, and the inlet should be left at the top, paved with two layers of stone slabs, with the bottom layer flush with the cellar opening, and the top layer extending into the opening. The area around the cellar opening should also be protected with stone masonry, rising one foot above the ground. The inlet is connected to the sedimentation pool so that runoff can flow into the cellar. The cellar bottom is plastered in a pot-bottom shape, concave in the middle and high around the edges, one foot thick, and pressed with the feet to make it even and firm. After the bottom of the water cellar is plastered, it should be covered with matting and pressed with stone slabs to prevent the water flow from damaging it. When the entire water cellar is plastered, it must be sealed to prevent it from drying and cracking. When it is time to store water, the inlet can be opened.

    怎样打水窖
    中共涉县县委办公室
    水窖地址的选择及施工季节
    选择水窖的地点，首先应注意土质情况，把水窖打在土层较厚的粘土和粘壤土地区。沙土及沙壤土一类地区则不适宜。其次，应看好水势地形，把窖址选在水流汇集及水流经过的地方，如路沟、道旁、梯田水簸箕口的下面，或防洪沟、水平沟连通的支沟旁。要想在较大的地块里打水窖，应根据地形的坡度选在水流汇集的出口，并注意在地边打上土埂，有计划地将水拦蓄，使水能够流入水窖，以保证水窖在雨后蓄上水。打水窖可利用冬闲时进行，在未上大冻前，先把窖址选好，并开一公尺深的口，等上大冻后，其他农活都不能进行时，再进行开挖，开春暖后再浆窖壁，使开挖好的水窖壁有一定时间进行风干。
    水窖的形状
    为了适应地形、土壤条件以及满足浇地和蓄水量的要求，水窖形状可以分为以下几种：
    第一种是“酒瓶式水窖”（如图）。这种水窖的优点是坚固、省工、离地近、好灌满，缺点是盛水量小。
    第二种是“连环水窖”（如图）。这种水窖是由三个“酒瓶式水窖”组成，窖底用管互通起来。这种水窖必须有一个水窖大而深，使一窖取水其它窖水都能使尽。这种窖盛水量大，可以安装水车，缺点是占地多。
    第三种是“葡萄式水窖”（如图）。这种水窖，是在单式的酒瓶水窖的窖身下方，另起三两个口，打成圆形盛水洞，像葡萄，所以叫葡萄水窖。它的好处是盛水量大、少占地、省工、省料、可兼有新旧两种水窖的优点，缺点是出水力比较小。
    第四种是“平窑水窖”（如图）。这种水窖，窖身只用七尺至一丈，即从旁挖窑，而窑洞则是在高崖下，所以也坚固耐用。
    第五种是“锅炉水窖”（如图）。这种水窖是平窑水窖的发展，打窖地势必须是窖的外下面就有一块地，地低于窖底。窖底安上缸管通向下地，需用水时开口即可自行流出，不用时封闭。它比上面几种更进一步，但必须选好地势。浆糊水窖壁
    浆糊水窖必须一气浆成，浆糊水窖的时间，应在春季天暖后进行。浆糊水窖的材料，一般是用白灰和干红粘土，按1比3重量比配合，加水调成稠泥浆状。浆糊一个水窖约用白灰六百至八百斤，干红粘土一千九百至二千四百斤。在配合前应先将干红粘土（多是块状）晒干，用碾压成粉面过筛，再用水荫湿，但不得加水太多。白灰的处理，也应预先加水熟化，并将其中石块、石碴拣净，成熟石灰浆再使用。浆糊前应注意扫除窖壁表面灰尘浮土；浆糊时应由窖壁底端向上一圈圈依次浆糊，并一气浆成。在窖壁与窖底相接处，应向窖底中心伸入一尺以上，踏底时将其压住。
    浆糊水窖的操作很简单，不用任何工具，用手抓一把浆泥贴到窖壁，并以手掌用力向上一搓，使浆泥与窖壁紧密的结合，浆泥的厚度一般是二寸左右，在浆糊好一部分后，便可用木郎头轻轻敲打，发现窖壁浆泥敲起，应先用手指扣破浆泥把空气放出，用手轻轻按住再进行敲打。浆糊好后的窖壁一般有一寸多厚，用手指敲打发生当当的响声。
    窖口、窖底的浆糊很重要，窖口周围二尺以内的浆泥厚度应在一尺左右，并将入水口留在上边，用两层石板铺砌，底层与窖口砌齐，上层伸入口中，窖口周围并用块石砌护高出地面一尺。进水口与澄泥池相通，以便使径流注入窖中，窖底浆糊似锅底形，中间凹，四周高，厚一尺，用脚踏压，使其均匀坚实。水窖底浆糊好后，应用席片铺好，上压石板，以防水流下时冲坏。当整个水窖浆糊好后，就须密封，以防风吹干裂，待蓄水时就可打开进水口蓄水了。
