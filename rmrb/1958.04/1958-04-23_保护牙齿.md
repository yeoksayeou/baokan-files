    Protecting Teeth
    Kaifang
    What grief is there in teeth falling out,
    What joy if they don't!
    I only hope they don't swell and ache,
    Announcing the ailment to the neighborhood!
                    — Ming, Wu Yan

    The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic says, "For men, at forty, the teeth become dry; at sixty-four, the teeth fall out. For women, the cycle is based on seven." This means that around the age of forty, human teeth begin to decline, and by the age of sixty, they start to fall out. Losing teeth causes inconvenience in eating and speaking, and also detracts from one's appearance. Therefore, Wu Yan in his poem "Tooth Loss" wrote: "...Food is hindered, pits and cores should be discarded... Speech is hindered, one should speak less to guests... Remembering when I first lost a tooth, I covered my mouth in shame." Bai Juyi also lost a tooth at the age of sixty-six and wrote a "Farewell to My Tooth" to comfort himself, saying, "Hair declines from the head, leaves wither from the tree, nothing, great or small, escapes going when its work is done."

    In fact, if teeth are well protected, their lifespan can be greatly extended.

    First, eat less sugar; eating too much easily causes toothache. This is because bacteria that cause tooth decay love sugar. When they encounter sugar, it's like fish in water, and they multiply and become very active. Especially for children, whose teeth are still very fragile and susceptible to decay, yet they particularly love to eat sugar. Actually, the starch in the food we eat every day is converted into sugar in the stomach and intestines, which is already enough for metabolic needs, and there is no need to take in extra. Too much sugar will be excreted in the urine, a complete waste.

    Second, rich wines and delicacies, overly acidic things, and very hot foods are all harmful to teeth. They not only damage the enamel on the outside of the teeth but also promote the growth of tooth-decaying bacteria.

    Third, I believe it is good to let the teeth appropriately chew harder foods (as long as they are not too hard). This will strengthen their function and make them less prone to loosening. This principle is the same as the well-developed muscles of manual laborers. So, instead of making food too finely chopped and soft, which makes the teeth too comfortable, it is better to make the food slightly coarser and harder, so that the teeth can be exercised. Moreover, food that is too finely chopped and soft will destroy more vitamins. It is said that in ancient times there was a saying "knock the teeth morning and evening, and there will be no tooth disease forever." Jing Yue Quan Shu (Complete Works of Jing Yue) states: "If one feels that the teeth are loose, then simply bite down gently, making sure they gradually bite evenly, doing this once or twice a day, or two or three times, and the roots will naturally become firm." It also says, "Whenever you want to urinate, be sure to bite down on your back teeth first, and then urinate, so that the kidney qi can also be retained, which will not only strengthen essence but also strengthen teeth." It seems that this is not without reason.

    Finally, let's talk about brushing your teeth, which is a very important part of protecting them. However, the supplement published an article on January 15 entitled "Horizontal Brushing and Vertical Brushing," which specifically discussed this issue. Readers can refer to it, so I will not repeat it here.

    保护牙齿
    开放
    齿落竟何悲，
    不落亦何喜！
    但愿不肿痛，
    叫号动邻里！
                    ——明、吴俨
    黄帝素问上说：“男子五八则齿槁，八八而齿去矣。女子以七为敉。”就是说人类一到四十左右，牙齿的机能便逐渐衰退，待到花甲之年，就要开始掉落了。牙齿掉落之后，在饮食和语言上固然会感到不便，对于容貌，也会有所减损。所以明人吴俨在他的“齿落”诗中写道：“……食物有所妨，肴核宜弃置。……出言有所妨，对客宜少语。……忆我初落时，掩口含羞耻。”白居易在六十六岁上也掉了齿，他写了一篇“齿落辞”安慰自己道：“发衰辞头，叶枯辞树，物无细大，功成者去。”
    其实，牙齿如果保护得好，它的寿命还是可以大大延长的。
    首先是要少吃糖，吃多了容易牙疼。因为蚀牙的细菌喜欢糖，一遇糖，真如鱼得水，就大大繁殖活动起来。尤其是孩子，牙齿还很脆嫩，经不起虫蛀，却又特别喜欢吃糖。其实，我们每天吃下的粮食中所含的淀粉在肠胃中转变而成的糖分，已经足够新陈代谢的需要，不必另外摄取。过多的糖分会随尿排泄出来，白白浪费掉。
    其次，美酒厚味，过酸的东西，十分热烫的饮食，都是伤齿的，不仅会损坏牙齿外面的釉质，并且也会促进蚀牙细菌的滋长。
    再次，我以为可以让牙齿适当地咀啮较硬的食物（只要不是太硬）。这会增强它的机能，使它不易松脱。这道理，同体力劳动者的肌肉一定发达是一样的。所以与其把食物弄得太碎太烂，使牙齿过于安逸，实在不如把食物弄得稍稍粗硬一点，叫牙齿锻炼锻炼的好。何况食物过于碎烂，还会更多地破坏维生素哩。据说古时有“晨昏叩齿，永无齿疾”的说法，景岳全书载：“尝觉齿有浮突之意，则但轻轻咬实，务令渐咬渐齐，或日行一二次，或二三次，而根自固矣。”又说：“凡欲小解时必先咬定牙根而后解，则肾气亦赖以摄，非但固精，亦能坚齿。”看来不是毫无道理的。
    最后，该谈谈刷牙的问题，这是保护牙齿很重要的一环。但是副刊在1月15日已登了一篇“横刷与顺刷”一文，专门论述了这个问题，读者可以参阅，这里不再重复了。
