　　Such a “Free World”
　　A Tree Hole for Home
　　In 1950s England, someone was actually found living in a tree hole! According to a report in the American “New York Herald Tribune,” recently, in Volchester, England, the wife of an unemployed worker, Doris, was arrested by the police for theft. During the trial, the court inquired about her home address and discovered that Doris had no home. For the past few months, she and her husband had been living in a tree hole in the wild. In the past, the couple originally lived in the carriage of a broken car, but after being evicted by the police, they found this tree hole, which they used torn burlap sacks to cover the entrance to keep out the wind, barely managing to live inside.
　　Both Soldiers and Merchants
　　American soldiers stationed in Britain have a dual identity: they are both soldiers and businessmen. Under the protection of their American military uniforms, they can pass without hindrance, and therefore engage in illegal smuggling and tax evasion in Britain on a large scale. According to the British “Worker’s Daily,” customs in Buses recently discovered that three American Air Force personnel were smuggling one hundred and fifty-four bottles of whiskey and nine thousand two hundred and eighty cigarettes… These three American soldiers and their British accomplices (a British policeman and a hotel waiter) were fined a total of one thousand two hundred and forty pounds by the court. Smuggling and tax evasion by American soldiers in Britain is commonplace and known to everyone. This small case is just a drop in the ocean of smuggling activities that have been uncovered, but the Buses court and customs are already satisfied, boasting greatly about cracking a “historic” case of smuggling by American soldiers.

　　如些“自由世界”
    树洞为家
    在二十世纪五十年代的英国，竟然还发现有人住在树洞里！据美国“纽约先驱论坛报”报道，最近，英格兰的伏尔彻斯特地方，有一位失业工人的妻子多丽斯被警察以偷窃罪名逮捕。法院在审讯时查问她的家庭住址，才发现多丽斯并没有家，最近几个月来，她和她的丈夫一直住在野外一棵大树的树洞里。过去，这一对夫妇原来住在一辆破汽车的车厢里，被警察驱逐后，才找到这个树洞，他们用破麻布袋围住洞口遮风，在里面勉强栖身。
    亦兵亦商
    驻在英国的美国军人身份是双重的，既当兵，亦经商。他们在美国军装的保护下通行无阻，因此在英国大做走私漏税的非法买卖。据英国“工人日报”消息，最近巴士的海关查出三个美国空军走私一百五十四瓶威士忌酒，香烟九千二百八十支……。这三个美国兵和他们的英国同谋者（一名英国警察和一个酒店侍者）共被法院罚款一千二百四十英镑。美国军人在英国走私漏税，如同家常便饭，人人皆知。这个小案子只不过是查获的走私活动中的沧海一粟，但是巴士的法院和海关已经心满意足，大肆吹嘘破获了一件“历史性”的美国军人走私案。
