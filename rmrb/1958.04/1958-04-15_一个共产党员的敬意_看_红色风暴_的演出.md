    A Communist Party Member's Respect
    ——Watching the Performance of "Red Storm"
    Quan Yu

    I don't know how to express my heartfelt gratitude to the comrades of the China Youth Art Theatre. They brought the epic of the Red Storm – the February 7th Great Strike – to the stage. I am a Communist Party member, an ordinary member of the Chinese working class, but I have never seen such a glorious image of my class in a play before. Shi Yang, the revolutionary intellectual who dedicated himself wholeheartedly to the cause of the working class, possessed such noble demeanor and great spirit; Lin Xiangqian, the great son of the working class, regarded powerful enemies as mere grass, and was as firm as steel in the cause of the working class; and the many ordinary workers and their families, as members of the working class, so believed in their own victory. The enemy's butcher knives could not force the word "resume work" from the mouths of heroes, and the enemy's treacherous deception could not deceive the heroes' eyes of truth. On the stage, the good sons and daughters of the working class all laid their hearts bare to the audience. In front of them, the ambassadors of British and American imperialism, Zhao Jixian, the representative of the Northern Warlord Wu Peifu, and their running dogs and lackeys, etc., all these characters who thought they were powerful and extremely clever, all became pathetic clowns, too base and insignificant to mention.

    Such a play, even if performed thirty years ago, could make the audience deeply believe that the cause of the working class must be victorious. Such a play, performed now, can even more enable people to recognize, through reviewing this period of revolutionary history, one of the most crucial issues in the victory of the Chinese revolution: it was precisely the conscious struggle and strong leadership of the working class and its political party that achieved the great victory of the Chinese revolution. Such a play and such a performance can give people noble sentiments, making all those with individualistic and selfish plans feel ashamed in front of the heroes in the play, and prompting people to strive for betterment. Even ten thousand years later, the appearance of such images will be inspiring. Such a performance creates such a fervent atmosphere among the audience: everyone leans forward, focusing on the heroes on the stage, and everyone's heart beats with the heroes' shouts. The body of martyr Lin Xiangqian, after his death, stands like a statue under the red-tinged lights. For a long time, people clench their teeth, gazing at the heroes on the stage, filled with revolutionary passion and reverence. Silently for several minutes, even after the curtain had been down for a long time, there suddenly erupted long and continuous applause. This applause could no longer be distinguished as dedicated to the fallen heroes or to the actors. If this means the playwrights and actors have achieved immortal success, it would be better to say that they have captured immortal events and immortal people to enrich art.

    The successful performance points to an indisputable truth: dramatic art possesses tremendous power, but only when it attaches itself to such great subjects can it gain people's love and respect. It is precisely for this reason that the audience ignores the imperfections in the performance and does not demand perfection from it.

    一个共产党员的敬意
    ——看“红色风暴”的演出
    权玉
    我不知如何向中国青年艺术剧院的同志们表示衷心的感谢，是他们把红色风暴——二七大罢工的史诗搬上了舞台。我是一个共产党员，是中国工人阶级的一个普通分子，但我从来还没有从戏里看到过自己阶级如此光辉的面貌。施洋，那全心献身于工人阶级事业的革命知识分子，是具有那样崇高的风度，伟大的气魄；林祥谦，工人阶级伟大的儿子，是那样视强敌如草芥，对工人阶级事业那样坚如钢铁；那许许多多的普通工人们，工人家属们，作为工人阶级的成员，是那样相信自己的胜利。敌人的屠刀，逼不出英雄口里的“复工”两字，敌人的奸诈诱骗，瞒不了英雄们的真理的眼睛。在舞台上，工人阶级的好儿女们，个个都把心赤裸裸地献给了观众。在他们面前，英、美帝国主义的大使，北洋军阀吴佩孚的代表赵继贤以及他们的走狗爪牙等等，这些自以为权势逼人，聪明绝顶的人物，个个都变成了狼狈不堪的小丑，卑鄙渺小得不足挂齿。
    这样的剧，即使在三十年以前演出，也能使观众对工人阶级事业一定要胜利深信无疑。这样的剧在现在演出，更能使人通过对这一段革命历史的温习，认识到中国革命胜利的一个最带关键性的问题：正是工人阶级和它的政党的自觉斗争和坚强领导，才取得了中国革命的伟大的胜利。这样的剧和这样的演出，能给人以崇高的情操，使一切怀有个人主义自私打算的人，面对剧中英雄们而自惭形秽，促使人心向上。即使在一万年后，出现这样的形象，也会激动人心。这样的演出在观众中造成了这样一种热烈气氛：个个都倾身向前注目台上的英雄，每个人的心都随着英雄的呼喊在跳动。林祥谦烈士遇难后的躯体，塑像般地屹立在红霞般的灯光下，在长长的时间里，人们咬紧牙关，凝望着台上的英雄，充满了革命的激情和崇敬。默默有数分钟之久，幕已落下许久了，才突然爆发了经久不息的掌声。这掌声已无法分别出是献给遇难的英雄的还是献给演员的了。如果说这是剧的编导和演员们获得了不朽的成功，还不如说是他们抓取了不朽的事件，不朽的人来充实了艺术。
    成功的演出，向我们提示了一个不可争辩的真理：戏剧艺术是具有巨大力量的，但只有当它附着于这样伟大题材的时候，才能获得人们对它如此热爱和尊敬。正是这个原因，才使观众忽略了演出中的缺陷，对它并不苛求了。
