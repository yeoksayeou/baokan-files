A Great Revolution in Coal Mining Technology
Hydraulic Coal Mining to be Promoted as Key Technology in Coal Industry

(Xinhua News Agency dispatch) This year, China's coal industry will focus on promoting a new technology – hydraulic coal mining. Two coal mines, each with an annual output of 200,000 tons of coal, will be established at Tangjiazhuang in Kailuan and Yangquhe in Fengfeng, using hydraulic power for all processes of mining, transportation, and hoisting. In addition, 20 to 30 hydraulic coal mining areas (using hydraulic mining only, not hydraulic hoisting) will be established in mines across the country as pilot projects for future widespread adoption.

Currently, preparations for these mines and mining areas have begun. The construction of the two mines is underway and is expected to be put into production in August.

Hydraulic coal mining is a major revolution in modern coal mining technology. Because it uses high-pressure water flow to dislodge coal, and then uses chutes, seamless steel pipes, and coal-water pumps to transport and hoist the coal to the surface, the equipment and processes are very simple, and the operation is relatively easy, unlike mechanized mines that require many complex mechanical equipment. Therefore, the use of hydraulic coal mining can not only improve coal mining efficiency and reduce production costs, but also save investment and shorten the time for mine construction. In particular, because workers operate far away from the working face, it can fundamentally improve the working conditions of mine workers and completely avoid accidents such as roof collapses and coal falls that occur when using ordinary coal mining machines. Gas accidents, which are prone to occur in general mechanized mines, can also be greatly reduced.

    采煤技术大革命
    煤炭工业重点推广水力采煤
    据新华社讯　我国煤炭工业今年将有重点地推广一项新技术——水力采煤。在开滦唐家庄和峰峰羊渠河两矿各建立一对年产二十万吨煤炭的全部用水力进行采煤、运输和提升的矿井，并将在全国各矿建立二十个到三十个水力采煤的采区（只用水力采煤，不用水力提升），作为将来普遍推广的试点。
    现在，这些矿井和采区的准备工作都已开始。两对矿井正在施工，预计在8月份可以投入生产。
    水力采煤是现代采煤技术上的一大革命。由于它采用高压的水流落煤，再利用溜槽无缝钢管和煤水泵把煤运输和提升到地面，设备和工序都很简单，操作也比较容易，不像机械化矿井那样需要许多复杂机械设备。因此，利用水力采煤不但可以提高采煤效率，降低生产成本，同时还可以节约投资和缩短建井时间。特别是因为工人操作时离开工作面很远，可以根本改善矿井工人的劳动条件和完全避免采用普通采煤机器时会发生冒顶、落煤等事故。一般机械化矿井容易发生的瓦斯事故，也可以大大减少。
