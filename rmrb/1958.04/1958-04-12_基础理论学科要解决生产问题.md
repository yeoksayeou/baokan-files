Should research work in basic theoretical disciplines also serve the Great Leap Forward in production? After debate, the Institute of Organic Chemistry began to reverse the idea that research connected with production practice and solving key production problems was of little academic significance and therefore undesirable. They reached a relatively unified opinion: In our country, which is still poor, production is not yet developed, and the tasks of socialist construction are very arduous, all scientists have a responsibility to strive to do more research work that serves the Great Leap Forward in production. Huang Wei-yuan, an organic chemist who returned from the United States two years ago, and his research group took the lead in posting big-character posters, stating, "We are determined to accept research work that is most beneficial to the current socialist construction, regardless of personal interests or whether papers can be published, and we challenge all research groups." They identified two research projects to serve the pharmaceutical industry: one was to use pig bile acid to produce a hormone called pregnenolone; the other was a systematic study of cardiotonic drugs. Other groups responded enthusiastically, and senior researchers went to factories and contacted chemical industry departments to select new topics related to organic chemistry in chemical industrial production practice.

    基础理论学科要解决生产问题
    基础理论学科的研究工作是否也要为生产大跃进服务呢？有机化学研究所经过辩论，开始扭转了认为联系生产实际、解决生产关键问题的研究学术意义不大、不愿意做的想法，得出了比较一致的意见：在我们国家还很穷、生产还不发达、社会主义建设任务非常艰巨的情况下，一切科学家都有责任争取多做为生产大跃进服务的研究工作。两年前从美国回国的有机化学家黄维垣和他领导的研究组先贴出大字报，表示“决心接受对当前社会主义建设最有益的研究工作，不考虑个人兴趣或是否能发表论文，并向各研究组挑战”。他们确定了两个为医药工业服务的研究项目：一项是用猪的胆酸制造一种激素——保孕素；另一项是关于强心药物的系统研究。其他各组也纷纷应战，高级研究人员们纷纷下厂、联系化学工业部门，选择化学工业生产实践中有关有机化学的新题目。
