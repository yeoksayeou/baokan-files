    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    8. Cherry Blossoms
    We are truly shockingly abundant in Japan, causing the entire nation to go mad with joy, getting drunk beneath the flowers. Thousands upon thousands of trees turn the mountains and fields into clouds; opening all at once in the face of the wind, myriad petals scattering in the breeze. Coming to China, we are even more steady and reliable, no longer standing out alone, a three-day hero. (Note) Humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one lag behind; even in the flower world, this is a lesson for you.
    (Note) Japanese proverbs include "Flowers are cherry blossoms, people are samurai," and "Cherry blossoms unseen for three days," referring to the cherry blossom's short bloom.

    9. Ten-Patterned Brocade
    Sword-like leaves resemble sweet flag, long stems shoot out, covered with buds; flowers of various colors bloom successively, a brocade-like reality. People like to cut us and insert us into vases; away from the roots, our flowers still bloom straight to the top. People are loving the flowers, but we are loving the people; we love the children of China, who are like stars scattered all over the earth. They should be called ten-thousand-patterned brocade, millions of patterned brocade; they must be trained, quickly building socialism.

    10. Unkillable
    We are flowers and grasses that existed in the past, exist now, and will exist forever; our name is peculiar, called "Unkillable." If you don't believe it, please pluck our flowers with their stems; as long as they are inserted into the soil, they can live very well again. But we are afraid of the cold and cannot survive the winter; our life can only be extended through seeds. Therefore, we are still eternally unkillable; the power of life is greater than atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs.

    11. Broken Bowl Flower
    Our white corolla has five petals, some are light purple or light blue; some are double-petaled and called autumn peony, which also look good when cultivated in gardens. But our vast world is in the countryside; farmers use us to repel flies, eliminate mosquitoes, and fertilize fields. The stems and leaves are poisonous; it depends on how they are used, and if used well, they won't break any bowls.

    12. Oleander
    We resemble bamboo but are not bamboo, resemble peaches but are not peaches; red flowers and green leaves, our posture is not so enchanting. We are afraid of the cold and not so fond of water; our biggest fault is that we particularly like fertilizer. If there is too little fertilizer, we will change; the red flowers will turn into white flowers. Here perhaps lies a profound lesson: a red expert might become a white expert!

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    8．樱　花我们在日本真真是多得惊人，会使举国若狂前来花下酩酊。千树万树使得漫山遍野如云，迎风一片齐开，迎风万点飘零。来到了中国，我们就更加稳重，不再是个人独出，三天的英雄。（注）谦虚使人进步，骄傲使人落后，就在花世界中，同样够你受用。
    （注）日本谚语有“花则樱花，人则武士”，又有“三日不见的樱花”，言樱花易谢，只能看三天。
    9．十样锦剑叶似菖蒲，长茎抽出，结满骨都；各色的花逐次开放，锦绣实相如。人们喜欢剪去，把我们插入花瓶，离了根，我们的花也要直开到顶。人们是在爱花，我们却是在爱人；我们爱中国孩子是地上满天星。他们应该说是万样锦，万万样锦，要他们锻炼，快把社会主义建成。
    10．死不了我们是昔有，今有和永有的花草，我们的名号稀奇，就叫着“死不了”。不信，请把我们的花朵连梗掐下，只要一插进土里又能活得很好。但我们害怕寒冷，过不了冬天，我们的生命只好靠种籽绵延。因此，我们依然是永远死不了，生命的力量大过原子弹、氢弹。
    11．打破碗花花我们的白色花冠是五瓣，有的是淡紫色或者淡蓝，也有的是双瓣名叫秋牡丹，栽培在庭园里面也很好看。但我们的广阔天地是乡间，农民们用来驱蝇、除蚊、肥田。茎叶有毒，看是怎样地使用，只要使用得好并不打破碗。
    12．夹竹桃我们似竹而非竹，似桃而非桃；红花碧叶，姿态并不那么妖娆。我们害怕冷，也不那么高兴水，最大的毛病是特别喜欢肥料。肥料如果少了，我们要起变化，红色的花就要变成白色的花。在这里或许包含着深刻教训：红色专家可能变成白色专家！
