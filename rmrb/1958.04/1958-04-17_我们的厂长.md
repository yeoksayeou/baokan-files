    Our Factory Director
    By Our Correspondent Lei Pu

    The workers of the jointly owned public-private Fuzhou Rubber Factory all hold Factory Director Lin Yu in high esteem. Whenever you talk to them about Lin Yu, they affectionately call her "our factory director."

    (I)

    In the spring of 1956, Lin Yu was assigned to the rubber factory. At that time, the factory was actually a dilapidated mess. The only usable thing taken over from the private sector was a bamboo-shed workshop, narrow and low, with holes and leaks all over the roof. When it rained, workers had to hold umbrellas to work; when it was windy, the whole factory had to stop work to save the workshop. But that was it, the workshop for sixty-eight workers from eight factories after the joint venture. Most of the machines taken over were scattered manual tools and scrap copper and iron. The machines were incomplete, and coupled with the workers' low skills, the products could not be sold, and the raw materials were not supplied, so the factory had to work half a day and rest half a day to maintain production.

    On the second day of her arrival at the factory, Lin Yu encountered a situation where there was no money to pay the workers' wages. The workers complained to her face: "The public is deceiving us. What are the benefits of joint ownership?" The representatives of the private sector were even worse; they often mumbled behind their backs, saying things like "Joint ownership is worse than no joint ownership," "What they say sounds good, but what they do may not be." There were no rules in the factory, and no one could control anyone. Before ten o'clock in the morning, some people would leave work to queue up for food. At night, the workers had no place to live; some slept in the workshop, some slept in the open air, and some slept on bridges or under large trees. Lin Yu and the production management personnel were always worried about the workers' health. Every night, in the stillness of the night, they would go out in different directions to call them back, dragging back anyone they found. In such situations, the workers were always full of resentment, complaining about not having a house to live in. Lin Yu also felt an unspeakable guilt in her heart; she should care about the workers, but she dared not face the facts.

    These difficulties made her feel as if she was carrying a burden of several thousand pounds. She had approached the leading cadres of the Municipal Industrial Bureau, complained to them, and expressed that she had no confidence in maintaining this mess. At that time, the responsible comrades of the Municipal Industrial Bureau also felt very棘手 (棘手 means thorny or troublesome). Because the raw materials for the rubber factory were state-controlled materials; the factory was dilapidated, there was no money, and there were no people, so if things dragged on, even the scrap copper and iron would be eaten up. Therefore, many people advocated closing the factory and mobilizing the workers to change jobs. Lin Yu also belonged to the "close the factory" faction. She had secretly accepted the task of listing the workers' names, preparing to mobilize those with strong labor to go up the mountains to reclaim wasteland, and to introduce the weaker ones to other occupations, simply taking a path of no conclusion. In the end, it was Vice Mayor Zhang Jizhong who refused, so this plan was not realized.

    (II)

    Lin Yu is a veteran Communist Party member who has persisted in underground struggle. She had a long ideological struggle over this vexing problem. Often, the more she thought about it, the less she could sleep, and the more she thought about it, the more uncomfortable she felt. She felt that she had "bowed her head to difficulties," and that she was not worthy of being a Communist Party member.

    Difficulties are objective; when encountered by weak people, they are like a sharp blade that cannot be touched, but when encountered by strong people, they are easily tamed. After making up her mind, Lin Yu proposed to the management personnel to save all expenses to support production. She took the lead in implementing this, not adding any office supplies, and even starting by reducing her own necessary expenses such as medical expenses. When the staff wanted her to ask the Municipal Industrial Bureau for some money, she said: "If production is not done well, even if the state invests money, it is like filling the sea with stones, with no return. The country is so big, and there are too many places to spend money, so we can't always ask the state for money." When the products could not be sold and the raw materials were not supplied, she personally carried packages everywhere, learning advanced experience from advanced factories and soliciting customers' requirements for the products. In order to solve the source of raw materials, she had been to Beijing; in order to improve technology, she had also been to Shanghai, and she had contacted all directions. When the workers had no place to live, no place to work, and no place to store goods, she gave up her office. When the workers slept in the bamboo shed, she often tiptoed in the middle of the night to cover them with quilts. She lived, ate, and worked like the workers.

    Her many resolutions and selfless spirit were repeatedly imprinted in the workers' eyes. Like Xiao Mingqing, a worker in the extrusion workshop, he was a very straightforward person. The hot-press extruder he operated was a key process in the production of electric wires. This machine was not dared to be operated by anyone when it was privately owned. The reason why the quality of the electric wires was low at that time was mainly because the operation problem of this machine was not solved. Once, Xiao Mingqing fell ill, and Lin Yu cared about him very much, which moved him greatly. From then on, he began to work hard on the machine. Lin Yu resolutely supported him, going to the machine to accompany him in experiments, often not sleeping until twelve o'clock at night. Xiao Mingqing was an impatient person, and when the experiment failed, he was so anxious that he was sweating profusely and said nothing. Lin Yu always encouraged him, if the experiment failed, try again, and if it failed again, try again. After a month, he finally found a complete set of experience to completely change the quality of the electric wires, and produced the first batch of electric wires with a withstand voltage of more than 15,000 volts.

    Lin Yu led the workers through many twists and turns of arduous struggle, and finally improved the quality of the products and opened up sales channels. Now, the new products of this factory have been sold all over the country. In the past, people would not want them even if they were asked to buy them, but now they are coming to the door and cannot cope.

    (III)

    Lin Yu is not only a skilled person in running a factory thriftily, but also a good comrade who studies technology diligently and is willing to learn from the masses. She united many old workers with skills and achievements around her and ran the factory well with everyone's help. She understands the machine performance, operation methods, and finished product specifications of each workshop. She didn't know anything when she first entered the factory. In the most difficult time the year before last, the factory established a technical research group, and all the workers with the highest skills and the most willingness to work were absorbed into it. Lin Yu directly led this group, researching technology and conducting experiments in the factory, and she personally participated. She also participated in the labor of each process, starting as an assistant, and then daring to try, gradually daring to try the operation of the extruder as well. No wonder the workers said: "Our factory director is a technician."

    There is a technician in the factory named Wu Zhiyun, an old man in his fifties who doesn't know a single character and has a frighteningly arrogant temper. But he has a set of skills, and he can repair all the machines in the factory, regardless of size. He also has a strength, cherishing the property of the country as if it were his own life. In the past year or so, he has used scrap copper and iron to design many new machines for the factory. Lin Yu respects him very much, often studying technology with him and experimenting together. The two get along like master and apprentice. He also respects Lin Yu very much, and tells her everything, often helping her solve many difficult problems and considering many problems that she cannot think of.

    (IV)

    Now, the Fuzhou Rubber Factory has completely changed its original appearance. Last year, it produced 3,840 kilometers of electric wires, which is more than fifteen times that of the private sector. Last year, it produced 152,660 pairs of rubber soles, which is more than thirty times that of the private sector. The quality of electric wires and rubber soles is constantly improving, and many that could not be manufactured in the past can now be manufactured. In the year before last and last year, it paid a total of more than 320,000 yuan in profits to the state, which is equal to ten times the original investment of the private sector. The number of employees has increased from sixty-eight to more than two hundred and seventy. However, Lin Yu still adheres to the original simple style. In the past year or so, the office has only bought five chairs, and most of the utensils are old. Someone wanted to buy a little more, but Lin Yu firmly disagreed. She said: "Everyone likes to sit on sofas, and everyone likes to sleep on spring beds, but compared with production, it doesn't matter whether you have them or not."

    However, Lin Yu is very concerned about the welfare of the workers. She believes that the most important thing to care for workers is to help them politically and solve the workers' most urgent and most important difficulties in production. She pays attention to important aspects such as workers' illness, family hardship subsidies, and diet.

    This is how "our factory director" has won people's love.

    我们的厂长
    本报记者　雷普
    公私合营福州橡胶厂的职工们，哪个都对女厂长林玉怀着钦佩的心理。只要和他们谈起林玉来，他们都会亲切地称呼她为“我们的厂长”。
    （一）
    1956年春天，林玉被派到橡胶厂来。那时，这个工厂实际上是个破烂摊子。从私方接收过来的唯一可以使用的就是一个竹篷厂房，又狭又矮，篷顶上满是破洞和漏洞。遇到雨天，工人要撑着雨伞做活；遇到刮风天，全厂要停工抢救厂房。但是，就是它，成了合营以后八家厂六十八个工人的厂房。工厂接收过来的机器，大部分是些零零星星的手工工具和废铜破铁。机器残缺不全，再加上工人技术低，产品卖不出去，原料又供应不上，工厂只得做半天歇半天来维持生产。
    林玉在到厂的第二天，就碰上没有钱，发不了工人的工资。工人当着她的面埋怨：“公家欺骗我们，合营有什么好处呢？”资方人员更不要说了，他们常常在背后嘟嘟喃喃，说什么“合营不如不合营”，“嘴吧讲的好，做起来就不一定”……。工厂里没有一点规矩，谁也管不了谁。还不到上午十点钟，有人就下班抢着排队等吃饭。晚上，工人没有住宿的地方，有的睡在车间，有的睡在露天，还有的睡在桥上或者大树底下。林玉和生产管理人员们常为工人的健康耽心。每到夜深人静的时候，便分头四处里往回叫，碰见一个，拖回一个。遇到这种场合，工人们总是满肚子怨气，埋怨没有房子住。林玉也感到内心有说不出的歉疚，她应该关心工人，但又不敢面对事实。
    这些困难使得她像背上了几千斤重的包袱一样，她找过市工业局的领导干部，向他们诉过苦，表示她没有信心把这个烂摊子维持下去。当时，市工业局的负责同志也感到非常棘手。因为橡胶厂的原料是国家统筹物资；厂又是破破烂烂的，钱也没有，人也没有，拖下去就是废铜烂铁也要吃光。所以有很多人主张关厂、动员工人转业。林玉也是属于“关厂”派的。她曾经接受任务暗暗地把工人的名单排了队，劳力强的准备动员上山开荒，弱的准备另外介绍其它职业，干干脆脆走一条不了了之的道路。最后，还是副市长张继中拒绝了，才没有实现这个打算。
    （二）
    林玉是一个坚持过地下斗争的老共产党员。她为这个伤脑筋的问题作过长时间的思想斗争。常常越想越睡不着，越想越觉着难受。她觉得自己“向困难低头了”，这样是不配做一个共产党员的。
    困难是客观存在，遇上懦弱的人，它像一把利刃似的碰不得，但碰到坚强的人，它是很容易驯服的。林玉下了决心以后，就向管理人员提出节省一切开支支援生产。她自己首先带头执行，她不添置办公用具，甚至连医药费等必要的开支也首先从自己开始降低下来。职工们想让她向市工业局开口要一些钱来，她说：“生产搞不好，国家投了钱，就像用石头填大海一样，有去无来。国家这样大，用钱地方太多了，不能老向国家要钱。”产品销不出去，原料供应不上，她便亲自背起包裹到处跑，向先进厂去学习先进经验，征求顾主对产品的要求。为了解决原料来源，她曾到过北京；为了改进技术，她也到过上海，四面八方她都挂了钩。职工没有地方住、没有地方办公、没有地方做仓库，她便把自己的办公室让出来。工人在竹篷里睡觉，她常常深夜里蹑手蹑脚去为他们盖被子，她和工人一样住、一样吃、一样工作。
    她的许多决心和忘我的精神，都一次一次地印在工人的眼帘里。像压出车间工人萧明清，是一个性情非常爽直的人，他操作的热压压出机是生产电线的关键工序。这架机器在私营时，是没有人敢操作的。当时电线所以质量低，也主要是没有解决这台机器的操作问题。有一次，萧明清病了，林玉非常关心他，使他很感动。从此，他就在机器上下起功夫来。林玉坚决支持他，到机器旁边去陪他试验，常常深夜十二点还不睡觉。萧明清是一个急性子的人，试验失败的时候，急得满头大汗，一句话也不说，林玉总是鼓舞他，试验坏了再来，再坏了再试验。经过一个月的时间，终于找出彻底改变电线质量的一套完整的经验来，并且生产出了第一批耐压一万五千伏以上的电线。
    林玉领导工人们经过许多曲折的艰苦的斗争，终于提高了产品质量，打开了销路。现在，这个厂里的新产品已经行销全国，过去求上门人家都不要，现在是找上门来应付不了。
    （三）
    林玉不仅是一个勤俭办厂的能手，而且是一个刻苦钻研技术，肯向群众学习的好同志。她把许多有技能有作为的老工人团结在自己周围，靠大家办好了工厂。她对每个车间的机器性能、操作方法、成品规格都懂得。她原来进厂的时候，一窍也不通。在前年最困难的时候，厂里就成立了技术研究小组，把技术最高、最肯干的工人全都吸收进来。林玉直接领导这个小组，研究技术，下厂实验，她都亲自参加。她还参加每个工序的劳动，起初是当助手，以后大胆起来，像压出机的操作也逐渐敢去试一试了。怪不得工人们这样讲：“我们的厂长就是技术员”。
    厂里有个技工叫吴致云，是一个五十多岁的老头子，一个字也不识，脾气骄得骇人。可是他有一套技术，厂里的机器，不管大小，他都能修理。他还有一个长处，爱护国家的财产如同爱护自己的生命一样。一年多来，他利用废铜烂铁给厂里设计了好多种新机器。林玉很尊重他，常常和他一道研究技术，一道实验，两个人处得像师徒一样。他对林玉也非常尊敬，和她无话不说，常常帮助她解决许多疑难的问题，替她考虑许多她想不到的问题。
    （四）
    现在福州橡胶厂已经彻底改变了原来的面貌。去年生产电线三千八百四十公里，相当于私营时的十五倍以上。去年生产了十五万二千六百六十双胶底，相当于私营时的三十倍以上。电线、胶底的质量都在不断提高，许多原来不能制造的现在能制造了。前年和去年，共向国家上缴利润三十二万多元，等于资方原来投资额的十倍。职工人数由六十八人增加到二百七十多人。但是，林玉仍然坚持着原来的简朴的作风。一年多来，办公室只买了五只坐椅，大部分用具都是旧的。有人想多买一点，林玉坚决不同意。她说：沙发谁也爱坐，弹簧床谁也爱睡，不过，跟生产比较起来，要它不要它都可以。”
    但是，林玉对工人的福利却非常关心。她认为：爱护工人最重要的是从政治上帮助，和在生产上解决工人最迫切、最重大的困难。工人生病、家庭困难补助和饮食等都是她注意的重要方面。
    “我们的厂长”就是这样取得了人们的爱戴。
