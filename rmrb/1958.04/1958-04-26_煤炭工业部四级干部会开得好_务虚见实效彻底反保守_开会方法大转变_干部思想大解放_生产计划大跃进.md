    The Coal Industry Ministry's Four-Level Cadre Meeting Achieves Great Success: Removing Conservatism and Seeing Real Results; A Great Transformation in Meeting Methods, A Great Liberation of Cadre Thinking, A Great Leap Forward in Production Plans
    (Our newspaper's reporters Song Zheng and Mu Yang report:) The Coal Industry Ministry held a four-level cadre meeting from March 25th to April 14th. This meeting consistently implemented the principle of first addressing ideological issues (务虚) and then addressing practical issues (务实), liberating everyone from the shackles of right-leaning conservative thought. On the basis of this great ideological liberation, advanced leap-forward targets were set. All participants believed that this was truly a meeting where politics took command.
    Before the meeting, the Coal Ministry had already decided that it would organize everyone to engage in extensive airing of views and debates (大鸣大放), rectify the leadership style of the ministry, improve relations between superiors and subordinates, and examine the principles, policies, rules, and regulations of the coal industry system. It was intended to organize a great leap forward in the coal industry system on the basis of first addressing ideological issues (务虚) and then addressing practical issues (务实), leading to a great ideological liberation. The Coal Ministry had already notified the participating units of this spirit, requesting everyone to prepare opinions regarding the ministry's leadership. However, after the cadres from various enterprises arrived, the Coal Ministry discovered that most comrades came prepared to accept tasks and set leap-forward targets. Although they had prepared some big-character posters, some were self-criticisms from lower-level comrades, and others, while offering opinions about the ministry, lacked sharp criticisms and mainly concerned general issues, and were not specific enough. The Coal Ministry leadership felt that the reason for this misalignment of spirits was that the leadership had not truly opened their hearts to everyone. If superiors did not sincerely open their hearts to subordinates, it would be difficult to ask subordinates to truly open their hearts to superiors. Therefore, members of the Party group and many bureau and division chiefs successively expressed their willingness and determination to accept criticism in the capacity of Communist Party members, advising everyone not to post those painless big-character posters. At the same time, they posted a few big-character posters that sharply criticized the minister and vice-ministers by name in the most prominent positions, praising the boldness and courage of these comrades. As a result, the situation immediately changed. Within a few days, nearly seven hundred participants posted more than 28,000 big-character posters. The big-character posters were not only large in number but also high in quality. Generally speaking, the content was more profound and sharper than the big-character posters posted during the ministry's previous extensive airing of views and debates. These big-character posters exposed a large amount of right-leaning conservative thinking on the part of the ministry's leadership, neglecting politics and failing to do political and ideological work. They criticized the ministry's many rules and regulations for being divorced from reality and restricting everyone's enthusiasm, and criticized the bureaucratic work style of ministers and bureau and division chiefs for not delving into reality... The big-character poster by Zhang Chao, the Party Secretary of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, and others, entitled “The Leadership Lacks a ‘Soul,’ the System Usurps Command,” criticized the ministry for planning that was just accounting and arguing, bargaining, and lacking ideological leadership. They criticized the comrades in the ministry who went down to inspect work for only paying attention to business and technology, not understanding the ideological situation, and rarely summarizing the experiences of the masses. When subordinates requested instructions and reported, the ministry always handled matters according to the rules and regulations, rarely considering new problems, and lacking the drive to break with conventions...
    After the debate began, the leadership summarized and synthesized the issues raised by everyone, determining that the criticism of right-leaning conservatism would be the guiding principle, and that issues related to the ministry's political and ideological leadership, rules and regulations, and systems would be debated together. However, at this time, problems arose again. Many comrades were accustomed to "务实 (being practical)" and could not turn to "务虚 (addressing ideological issues)" all at once. Initially, everyone cited some examples to prove that the ministry had conservative thinking and explained that the lower levels also had conservative thinking, that conservative thinking was a mutual influence between superiors and subordinates, and that everyone had a responsibility. At this time, the responsible comrade of the Coal Industry Ministry's Party Group adopted the method of dissecting a sparrow to help everyone analyze the problem. Since the second half of 1956, a situation of tight coal supply had emerged nationwide. During this period, the conservative thinking of the Coal Ministry was very serious. The responsible comrade of the ministry's Party Group found comrades from Jiaozuo, Fushun, and other mining bureaus who were attending the meeting to analyze this situation together. The analysis proved that in 1957, these two bureaus were fully capable of producing more coal. The responsible comrade of the ministry's Party Group enlightened the comrades of these two bureaus to further analyze why, when the country and the masses were so in need of coal, no one was willing to accept the increased production task. Through this kind of guidance, these comrades further dug out that at that time, everyone was putting the interests of their own enterprises first and the needs of the country and the masses second. They even opposed the interests of their own enterprises to the interests of the country. In order to obtain more enterprise bonus funds and engage in more welfare projects, they tried every means to suppress the plan and even adopted the method of concealing the true situation and deceiving the superiors to refuse to accept the increased production task. Everyone realized that this was a dangerous tendency of losing command and falling into the quagmire of economism. This kind of departmentalism and individualism was very common in various bureaus and mines. Clarifying this issue in these two bureaus was very beneficial to raising everyone's understanding. In order to "务虚 (address ideological issues)" well, each group designated some comrades with higher levels of ideological and theoretical understanding to form core groups to help everyone explore the essence through phenomena and explore political ideology and theoretical issues through business and technical issues in the discussion of problems. With the specific help of the leadership, the debate deepened. Originally, everyone only knew what conservative thinking was but did not know why. At this time, they were able to raise their understanding to the height of theory and ideology to analyze and criticize it. The analysis and criticism of conservative thinking was carried out around the plan and production situation of the Coal Industry Ministry from 1956 to 1957. In the production upsurge of 1956, there had been a situation of excessive accidents. However, without conducting detailed investigation and research on this situation, it was subjectively affirmed that this was because "the plan was set too high, pursuing output, pursuing progress, and resulting in risky operations." Subsequently, an anti-"rash advance" sentiment was generated at the Beidaihe meeting. As a result, the 1956 production plan was not completed, making the coal supply situation in the market extremely tight for a time. In view of the tight coal supply situation, the state requested that 1957 produce more than 10 million tons of coal than 1956, but the Coal Industry Ministry, from top to bottom, used many excuses to only accept the task of 8.5 million tons, but the actual implementation result was more than 13 million tons. Why was the plan so conservative? The following issues were clarified in this debate. The coal system, from the ministry to the various bureaus, misunderstood the relationship between needs and possibilities. They did not use their best efforts to meet the needs of the country and the people, but rather let the needs of the country and the people be reversed to obey their so-called "possibilities." When considering possibilities, the Coal Ministry repeatedly emphasized stability and reliability, even lying on weak links and only proposing unfavorable factors to deal with the demands of the state, such as saying that the nation's old mines were "born deficient and acquired maladjustment," and had the possibility of "danger" at any time, as an excuse for not accepting increased production tasks. On the issue of the relationship between safety and production, the Coal Ministry also had erroneous understandings from top to bottom. In 1950, the erroneous slogan of "safety first" was proposed, making production subordinate to safety. Later, the slogan of "safe production" was proposed, but the concept was still unclear, and the interpretation was different. In fact, most people still believed that safety and production were contradictory, and that production should be subordinate to safety. At the Beidaihe Coal Industry Conference in 1956 and the planning conference in November of the same year, there was such a statement: "If there is a contradiction between safety and production, safety should be obeyed first; if there is a contradiction between safety regulations and production, the safety regulations should be resolutely implemented." This means that safety can produce more, and unsafe conditions will produce less, or even not produce. Therefore, some units often emphasized poor natural conditions and poor equipment and were unwilling to produce more; some units, once an accident occurred, thought it was caused by overproduction and risky operations. After the debate, everyone realized that safe production is a complete and inseparable whole. As long as the masses are relied upon to do a good job of ideological work, resolutely implement technical regulations and safety regulations, and increase output does not necessarily mean that it is necessary to engage in risky operations or that the safety situation will deteriorate. Zixing, Yiluo, Jiaozuo, Pingdingshan, Zibo, and other units all examined that the reason why safety and production were opposed in the past was that they were frightened by safety issues from top to bottom. Everyone also cited concrete examples to illustrate this point. Xinbo Mine is a mine with the worst natural conditions in the Zibo mining area, but because they focused on ideological work, relied on the masses, strengthened technical management, and adopted a attitude of meeting difficulties rather than retreating from them, they overfulfilled their tasks every year during the first five-year plan and eliminated fatal accidents. Therefore, everyone felt that ideological leap is the foundation of safe production leap. The debate also criticized the subjective tendency of looking down on local enterprises and small mines that were divorced from reality.
    On the basis of ideological liberation, everyone mustered their energy, revised the leap-forward plan of the coal industry system, and exchanged advanced experiences in various aspects. In the stage of airing views and debates, the leaders of the Coal Ministry led everyone to break away from specific problems to "务虚 (address ideological issues)," while also paying attention to the fact that there was substance in the abstract; in the stage of discussing indicators and measures, they turned to "务实 (address practical issues)," while also paying attention to the fact that there was abstraction in the substance. Some experience introductions that focused on substance generally met the requirements of being both red and expert, with substance in the abstract. For example, when some units introduced experiences in large-cycle operations, mechanization, safe production, and planting experimental fields, they talked about mastering the laws of nature and also talked about the mass line, political and ideological leadership, and other issues.
    This meeting not only greatly destroyed conservative thinking, formulated advanced leap-forward targets, and deepened the rectification of the Coal Ministry, but also promoted the rectification of coal enterprises. During the meeting, the comrades from each unit who participated in the meeting wrote letters or made phone calls to convey the spirit of the meeting. Some units believed that although the number of big-character posters in their units was already large, the exposure and criticism of the leadership's thinking was not deep enough, and they were preparing to redeploy the rectification movement based on the spirit of this meeting.

    煤炭工业部四级干部会开得好
    务虚见实效彻底反保守
    开会方法大转变　干部思想大解放　生产计划大跃进
    本报讯　记者宋琤、穆扬报道：煤炭工业部3月25日至4月14日召开了四级干部会议。这次会议始终贯彻了先务虚后务实，使大家从右倾保守思想的束缚中解放出来，在思想大解放的基础上定出了先进的跃进指标。参加会议的人都认为这真正是一次政治挂帅的会议。
    在开会之前，煤炭部已经确定在这次会议上要组织大家大鸣大放，整顿部的领导作风，改善上下级之间的关系，检查煤炭工业系统的方针政策及规章制度，在先务虚后务实思想大解放的基础上组织煤炭工业系统的大跃进。这个精神煤炭部本来早已通知参加会议的各单位，要求大家对部的领导准备意见。可是，当各企业干部陆续到来之后，煤炭部发现大多数同志是来准备接受任务制定跃进指标的，虽也准备了一些大字报，可是有些是下边同志的自我检讨，有些虽然也对部提了意见，但尖锐的批评很少，大多是一般问题，而且不够具体，煤炭部领导方面感到大家的精神所以不对头，主要是领导方面还没有真正向大家交心，上级不向下级诚恳地交心，就很难要求下级向上级真正交心。于是，党组的成员和许多局、司长，先后以共产党员的身份向大家表示了接受批评的愿望和决心，劝告大家不要贴那些不痛不痒的大字报，同时把少数指名指姓尖锐批评部长和副部长的大字报贴到最著目的地位，表扬这些同志的气魄和勇气。这样一来，情况立刻就转变过来。几天之内参加会议的近七百人，贴出了两万八千多张大字报。大字报不但数量多而且质量高，一般说，比部里几次大鸣大放贴出的大字报内容要深刻和尖锐。这些大字报大量揭发了部领导方面的右倾保守思想，忽视政治不做政治思想工作，批评部里的许多规章制度脱离实际束缚了大家的积极性，批评部长、局司长们不深入实际的官僚主义作风……。焦作矿务局的党委书记张超等的大字报以领导缺
  “灵魂”、制度篡统帅为题，批评部里作计划是算账加吵嘴，讨价还价，缺少思想领导；批评部里同志下去检查工作只注意业务和技术，不了解思想情况，也很少总结群众的经验；下边请示报告，部里总是按规章制度办事，很少考虑新问题，打破常规的劲头不大……。
    开始辩论以后，领导方面把大家提出的问题加以归纳综合，确定以批判右倾保守为纲，有关部的政治思想领导、规章制度、体制等问题一起辩论。可是，这时候又碰到了问题，很多同志“务实”惯了，转向“务虚”一时转不过来。开始时，大家举出一些事例证明部里有保守思想并且说明下边也有保守思想，保守思想是上下互相影响，大家都有责任。这时候，煤炭工业部党组负责同志，就采取解剖麻雀的办法帮助大家分析问题。1956年后半年以来全国出现了煤炭供应紧张的情况，这一时期，煤炭部的保守思想表现得非常严重。这个部的党组负责同志，找焦作、抚顺等矿务局参加会议的同志们一起分析这个情况。分析结果证明，1957年这两个局完全有可能多出煤炭。这个部的党组负责同志，启发这两个局的同志们进一步分析，既然可以增产，为什么眼看着国家和群众那么需要煤炭，而竟然谁都不肯接受增产任务。经过这样的诱导，这些同志就进一步挖掘出当时大家是把本企业的利益放在第一位，而把国家和群众的需要放在第二位，甚至把本企业的利益和国家利益对立起来，为了使本企业多得企业奖励基金，多搞福利事业，就要想尽一切办法把计划压低，甚至采取隐瞒真实情况欺骗上级的办法来拒绝接受增产任务，大家认识到这是失掉了统帅陷入经济主义泥坑的一种危险倾向。这种本位主义和个人主义的不良倾向在各局、矿十分普遍。这两个局在这个问题上弄通了，对于提高大家的认识有很大好处。为了“务虚”务得好，各组都指定一些思想理论水平较高的同志，组成核心小组，在讨论问题中帮助大家透过现象发掘本质，透过业务技术问题探讨政治思想和理论问题。在领导的具体帮助下，辩论深入了。原来大家对保守思想是只知其然不知其所以然，这时候就能够提高到理论和思想的高度来加以分析批判。对保守思想的分析批判是围绕着1956年到1957年煤炭工业部的计划和生产状况进行的。在1956年的生产高潮中，曾经出现过事故过多的情况，但是，没有对这种情况进行详细地调查研究，就主观主义地肯定这是因为“计划订的偏高，追求产量，追求进度，冒险作业的结果”，接着在北戴河会议中产生了一种反“冒进”的情绪。这样1956年的生产计划没有完成，使市场上的煤炭供应情况一度极为紧张。鉴于煤炭供应的紧张情况，1957年国家要求比1956年增产一千多万吨煤，而煤炭工业部从上到下以很多借口，只接受八百五十万吨的任务，但实际执行的结果是超过一千三百万吨。为什么计划会这样保守呢？在这次辩论中弄清楚了以下几个问题。煤炭系统从部到各局错误地理解了需要与可能的关系。他们不是用最大的努力来满足国家和人民的需要，而是让国家和人民的需要颠倒过来服从他们的所谓“可能”，而在考虑可能的时候，煤炭部又是再三强调稳妥可靠，甚至躺在薄弱环节上，只提出不利的因素去对付国家的要求，如说全国旧矿井“先天不足后天失调”，随时有发生“危险”的可能，作为不接受增产任务的借口。在安全和生产的关系问题上，煤炭部也从上到下有着错误的认识。1950年曾经提出了“安全第一”的错误口号，让生产服从安全。以后又提出“安全生产”的口号，可是概念仍然不清，解释也就各不相同。实际上多数人仍然认为安全和生产是矛盾的，而且在让生产服从安全。1956年北戴河煤炭工业会议和同年11月的计划会议上，就有这样的说法：“如果安全和生产有了矛盾，首先服从安全；保安规程和生产有了矛盾，则坚决执行保安规程”。这就是说安全了才能多生产，不安全就少生产，甚至不生产。因此，有些单位常常强调自然条件不好，设备不好，不愿多生产；有些单位一出事故，就认为是多生产，冒险作业造成的。经过辩论，大家都认识到安全生产是一个完整的不可分割的整体，只要依靠群众做好思想工作，坚决执行技术规程和保安规程，增加产量决不意味着要冒险作业或安全情况恶化。资兴、宜洛、焦作、平顶山、淄博等单位都检查出过去所以把安全和生产对立起来，是从上到下被安全问题吓倒了。大家还举出具体例子来说明这个问题。新博矿是淄博矿区自然条件最差的一个矿，可是因为他们抓紧了思想工作，依靠了群众，加强了技术管理，对困难采取了迎上去而不是退下来的态度，在第一个五年计划期间年年超额完成任务，消灭了死亡事故。因此，大家都感到，思想跃进是安全生产跃进的基础。在辩论中还批判了看不起地方企业和小型矿井的脱离实际的主观主义倾向。
    在思想解放的基础上，大家鼓起干劲，修改了煤炭工业系统的跃进计划，交流了各方面的先进经验。在鸣放和辩论阶段，煤炭部领导方面领导大家脱出具体问题来“务虚”，同时又注意虚中有实；在讨论指标和措施的阶段，则转向“务实”，同时注意到实中有虚。有些以实为主的经验介绍，一般说达到了又红又专实中有虚的要求，比如，有些单位在介绍大循环作业、机械化、安全生产、种试验田等经验时，既谈到掌握自然规律，又谈到群众路线政治思想领导等问题。
    这次会议不但大破了保守思想，制定了先进的跃进指标，使煤炭部的整风深入一步，同时也推动了煤炭企业的整风。就在会议期间，各单位参加会议的同志都写信或打电话回去传达会议精神。有些单位认为本单位虽然大字报数量已经很多，但对领导思想还揭发批判得很不深刻，准备根据这次会议的精神重新部署整风运动。
