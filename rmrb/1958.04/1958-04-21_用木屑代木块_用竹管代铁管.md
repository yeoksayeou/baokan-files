    Replace Wood Blocks with Wood Shavings
    Replace Iron Pipes with Bamboo Tubes
    To improve the quality of steel ingots, steel plants across the country have adopted the method of adding wood blocks inside the ingot molds during the ingot casting process since 1955. While this improved the quality of steel ingots, it also increased the cost of steel. Taking our Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant as an example, each steel ingot requires a four-inch wide and two-inch thick wood block, consuming more than 1,000 cubic meters of wood per year. Including processing costs, this increases the cost of steel by about 150,000 yuan. In the past, we made many suggestions to reduce waste, but some were not successful due to lack of experimentation, and others did not receive leadership support, so the waste phenomenon persisted for a long time. After the start of the Rectification Movement, with the support of the leadership, the experiment of replacing wood blocks with wood shavings was successful. This can reduce costs by about 120,000 yuan per year and save 1,000 cubic meters of wood.
    The method of replacing wood blocks with wood shavings is very simple: mix starch paste with wood shavings, press them into blocks, and dry them before use. I hope that steel plants using wood blocks for steel casting can adopt this method to save wood for the country. Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, Jia Bingkun.

    Replace Iron Pipes with Bamboo Tubes
    We are cadres dispatched by the Ministry of Construction Engineering to Huanghua County, Hebei Province, to participate in labor training. Based on our practical experience, we would like to make a suggestion to Comrade Shi Yuchun, a member of the Bagongqiao Iron Industry Cooperative in Puyang County, Henan Province. The People's Daily published news on March 13 about his successful trial production of "automatic irrigation suction pipes." We believe that this type of suction pipe can be replaced with bamboo instead of iron pipes. The specific method is to use two thick bamboo poles. One pole is hollowed out, and the top end is sawed into a bevel. Install a water outlet half a foot from the top end. One end of the other bamboo pole is not hollowed out. Drill a round hole three or four inches from the non-hollowed end, insert the beveled top end of the first bamboo pole into the hole at an angle of approximately 360 degrees, and glue the joint together for use. We have proven through practical use that the effect is good.

    用木屑代木块
    用竹管代铁管
    为了提高钢锭质量，全国各炼钢厂自1955年起，在铸锭工序上采取了钢锭模内加木块的办法。这样虽然钢锭的质量提高了，但是钢的成本却提高了。以我们上海第一钢铁厂来说，每只钢锭内加一块四寸宽、二寸厚的木块，全年要消耗木材一千多立方公尺，连加工费合在一起，使钢的成本增加了十五万元左右。过去，我们曾提出许多建议，设法减少浪费。但有的因为没有试验成功，有的没有得到领导上的支持，浪费现象长期存在。整风运动开始后，在领导支持下，以木屑代替木块的试验成功了。全年约可降低成本十二万元左右，并且可以节省一千立方公尺木材。
    木屑代替木块的方法很简单，用淀粉调成浆糊和木屑拌匀压延成块，烘干后即可使用。我希望采用木块铸钢的炼钢厂，能采用这种办法来给国家省节木材。　上海第一钢厂　贾秉坤用竹管代铁管
    我们是建筑工程部下放到河北省黄骅县参加劳动锻炼的干部。根据我们的实际经验，向河南省濮阳县八公桥铁业社社员史玉春同志提个建议。3月13日人民日报登载他试制成功“自动灌溉吸水管”的消息，我们认为这种吸水管可以用竹子代替，不必用铁管。具体作法是用两根粗竹子，一根打通中心，顶端锯成斜面，距离顶端半尺处安装水口。另一根竹子的一头不打通，在不打通的这一头三、四寸的地方凿一圆孔，把第一根竹子斜面顶端插入孔内，角度约三百六十度，衔接处用胶粘住后即可使用。我们经过实际使用，证明效果良好。
