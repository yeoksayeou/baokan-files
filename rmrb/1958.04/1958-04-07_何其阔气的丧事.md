From the Masses' Criticism

    Such an Extravagant Funeral
    Not long ago, Comrade Zhu Kuisheng, who works outside our township, came back because of his father's death. This comrade used to be an armed forces minister in a certain county, and later he was transferred to Yanzhou to be in charge of a certain bureau. Now he is in Jinan, also a relatively responsible cadre. Therefore, the people in the township have always respected him. However, Comrade Zhu Kuisheng did not leave us with a good impression this time he came back.
    There is nothing wrong with him coming back to hold a funeral for his father. But this funeral was held so lavishly. On the day of the "opening of the mourning hall," there were paper figures and horses, a neat lineup, and eight or nine tables of banquets were set up, fifteen catties of wine were bought, and seventeen or eight packs of cigarettes. When it came to the burial, there was a lot of blowing and beating, a lively day. At present, all organs are carrying out the Two-Anti movement. Why is Comrade Zhu Kuisheng still putting on such a show?

    何其阔气的丧事
    不久以前，我们乡出外工作的朱奎升同志，因为父亲去世，回来了一趟。这位同志过去在某县当过武装部长，后来调兗州负责某局工作，现在在济宁，也是一位比较负责的干部，所以，乡里的人一向对他是比较尊敬的。但是，朱奎升同志这次回来却没有给我们留下好印象。
    他回来给父亲办丧事，这没有什么可说的。但这场丧事办得是那样阔气。“开吊”那天，纸人纸马，阵容整齐，又摆了八、九桌酒席，买了十五斤酒，十七、八条香烟。临到安葬，又吹吹打打，热闹了一天。目前，各机关都在开展双反运动，朱奎升同志为什么还这样讲排场？
