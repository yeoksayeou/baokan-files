    Suining Builds New People-Run Cultural Stations

    (Reported by this newspaper) Jiangsu Province's Suining County has recently built twenty-one new people-run cultural stations. This county, with twenty-eight townships, previously had only eleven cultural stations, far from meeting the needs of the broad masses. The broad masses of the county had repeatedly proposed establishing their own cultural stations without state subsidies. After research, the leaders of Suining County agreed to the demands of the masses.

    睢宁新建民办文化站
    本报讯　江苏睢宁县最近新建了二十一个民办文化站。这个县二十八个乡、镇，过去仅有十一个文化站，远不能满足广大群众的要求。该县广大群众曾多次提出不要国家贴补，自己办文化站。睢宁县领导上经过研究，同意了群众的要求。
