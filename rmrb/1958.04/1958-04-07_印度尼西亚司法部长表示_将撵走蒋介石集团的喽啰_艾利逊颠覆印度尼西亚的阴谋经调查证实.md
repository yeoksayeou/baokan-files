Xinhua News Agency dispatch, Jakarta: Indonesian Minister of Justice Maengkom said that the Indonesian government is already aware of the activities of Chiang Kai-shek elements in the country and has registered their names for future action.

"Indonesia News" published a conversation between Maengkom and reporters from this newspaper on the 5th. He said that those Chiang Kai-shek elements who are clearly carrying out hostile activities against the Republic of Indonesia will be deported.

"Indonesia News" also quoted sources as saying that there are a total of twenty-one ringleaders of the Chiang Kai-shek clique directing subversive activities throughout Indonesia. Their main areas of activity are Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, Makassar, and Manado. The Chiang Kai-shek clique organizations in Indonesia maintain close and frequent contact with their headquarters in Taipei.

According to a report in the "Sunday Star" on the 6th, elements of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Indonesia are plotting new conspiracies to cope with the situation created after the truth about the Chiang Kai-shek clique's assistance to Indonesian rebels was revealed.

The newspaper revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is conspiring to strengthen "cooperation" with the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia and is asking the United States to find ways to protect members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. The Chiang Kai-shek clique is also attempting to launch an anti-communist movement, with the assistance of the U.S. Embassy, by slandering the People's Republic of China and Indonesian Chinese, and by plotting to shift Indonesia's national vigilance.

According to "Sunday News," a special Indonesian investigation committee has confirmed that the news published by the Indian magazine "Blitz," which revealed that former U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Allison had a conspiracy to overthrow President Sukarno and the Indonesian government, is factual.

The committee was established to investigate whether the secret telegrams of Allison discovered in Taipei, which were revealed by the magazine "Blitz," were authentic.

According to reports, the committee believes that after studying the original drafts of the telegrams published by "Blitz," there were no signs of fabrication. The committee also made direct contact with people familiar with the situation and the providers of the news published by "Blitz."

The newspaper said that the results of the investigation proved that Allison not only requested the smuggling of arms into Indonesia through telegrams but also directly sent a number of Indonesians to the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan. The Indonesian authorities now know the names of these people who were sent to Taiwan and will interrogate them soon.

The newspaper also said that in order to implement the plan to transport arms for the Islamic army, Allison sent an American named W.P. to Hong Kong to handle the matter. W.P. is "not unfamiliar" to Indonesia.

    印度尼西亚司法部长表示
    将撵走蒋介石集团的喽啰
    艾利逊颠覆印度尼西亚的阴谋经调查证实
    本报综合报道　据新华社雅加达讯：印度尼西亚司法部长马恩科姆说，印度尼西亚政府已经知道这里有蒋介石分子进行活动，并且已经把他们的名单登记起来，以便将来处理。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”5日发表了马恩科姆对这家报纸的记者的谈话。他说，那些显然对印度尼西亚共和国进行敌对活动的蒋介石分子，将定予驱逐出境。
    “印度尼西亚新闻”还引述有关方面的消息说，在全印度尼西亚指挥颠覆活动的蒋介石集团的头目共有二十一个，他们的主要的活动地点是雅加达、泗水、棉兰、望加锡和万鸦老等地。在印度尼西亚的蒋介石集团的团体同台北的总部保持着很密切和经常的联系。
    据“星期日明星报”6日报道，在印度尼西亚的蒋介石集团分子正在策动新的阴谋，企图应付在蒋介石集团分子援助印度尼西亚叛乱分子的真相被揭露以后所造成的局势。
    这家报纸揭露，蒋介石集团分子阴谋加强同美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的“合作”，并且要求美国设法保护蒋介石集团分子。蒋介石集团分子还企图通过美国大使馆的协助，发动一个诬蔑中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚华侨以及阴谋把印度尼西亚的民族警惕转移来进行反共的运动。
    另据“星期日新闻”报道，印度尼西亚的一个特别调查委员会已经证实，印度“闪电”周刊刊载的揭露前美国驻印度尼西亚大使艾利逊要推翻苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府的阴谋的消息是符合事实的。
    这个委员会是为调查“闪电”周刊揭露在台北发现的艾利逊的几封秘密电报是否确实而设立的。
    据报道，这个委员会认为，研究了“闪电”周刊发表的几封电报的原稿以后，看不出有捏造的迹象。委员会还跟熟悉这件事情的情况的人士和“闪电”周刊刊载的消息的提供者进行了直接接触。
    报纸说，调查的结果证明，艾利逊不仅曾经通过电报要求向印度尼西亚私运军火，而且直接派了若干印度尼西亚人到台湾蒋介石集团那里去。印度尼西亚当局目前已经知道被派到台湾去的这些人的名字，不久将审讯他们。
    报纸又说，为了执行为伊斯兰教军运送军火的计划，艾利逊曾经派遣一个名叫W·P的美国人到香港去处理这件事。W·P这个人对印度尼西亚来说“不是陌生的”。
