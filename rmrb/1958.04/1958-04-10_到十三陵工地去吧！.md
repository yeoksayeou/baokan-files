    Let's Go to the Ming Tombs Construction Site!
    Dai Zhenhao
    The Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site needs more manpower!
    Now, the flood season is getting closer and closer, and there is still a lot of work to be done on the reservoir construction site; several thousand migrant workers are about to return home for spring plowing; whether the reservoir project can be completed before the rainy season, whether we can realize our oath at the beginning of construction, all depends on the shoulders of cadres, soldiers, students and migrant workers in the capital.
    We have tens of thousands of comrades who have sweated or are sweating on the reservoir construction site, and tens of thousands more are ready to sweat. The
  Ming Tombs Reservoir is a flower that the people of the capital dedicate to the motherland in the spring of socialism!
    The Ming Tombs Reservoir is also a flower of friendship irrigated by the sweat of many foreign friends!
    This flower is the pride of the people of the capital, the pride of the people of the motherland! We, the heroic people of the capital, must make it bloom as scheduled.
    The Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site needs more manpower! Let us, office cadres, commanders and fighters of the troops, ride the wind and waves, further develop the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, muster the indomitable socialist vigor, and display the heroic qualities of the working people, and go to the construction site!

    戴真浩
    十三陵水库工地需要更多的人力！
    现在，离汛期越来越近，水库工地上还有许多工作要做；有几千民工却又该回家春耕了；能不能在雨季前赶好水库工程，能不能实现我们在动工前夕的誓言，这干系都在首都干部、战士、学生和民工们的肩上。
    我们有成千上万的同志在水库工地上流过汗或流着汗，还有成千上万的同志准备去流汗。十
  三陵水库，是首都人民在社会主义的春天献给祖国的一朵花！
    十三陵水库，也是由许多外国朋友们的汗水所灌溉成的友谊之花！
    这朵鲜花，是首都人民的骄傲，祖国人民的骄傲！我们，英雄的首都人民一定要它如期开放。
    十三陵水库工地需要更多的人力！让我们，机关干部、部队的指战员们，乘风破浪，更加发挥艰苦奋斗的革命精神，鼓起无坚不摧的社会主义干劲，显示出劳动人民的英雄本色，到工地上去吧！
