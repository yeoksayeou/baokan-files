Closely Combined with the Great Leap Forward in Industrial and Agricultural Production
Yunnan Publishes a Large Number of Popular Readings

    Of the fifty-three books published by the Yunnan People's Publishing House in the first quarter of this year, popular readings accounted for 83%.

    The content of these popular books, in part, is closely combined with the current Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production. Among them are pamphlets introducing crop cultivation techniques, high-yield experiences, and improved tools; "Agricultural Common Sense" and "Basic Agricultural Knowledge" for cadres sent to the countryside and township/commune cadres to study; and books published according to the needs of Yunnan's development of local industry, such as "Methods for Exploiting Yunnan's Non-Ferrous Metal Industrial Resources" and "Types and Methods of Chemical Fertilizers". Another part is the literacy teaching materials and popular entertainment singing materials compiled to support rural literacy campaigns and mass cultural activities. In addition, many popular readings expounding the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism have also been published.

    In order to make publications reflect and guide reality in a timely manner, and to quickly popularize them among workers and peasants, the Yunnan People's Publishing House has adopted a variety of publishing forms. For example, the irregular "Science Popularization Agricultural Technology Leaflet Data" was published in conjunction with agricultural production seasons, and the "Leaflet Song Selections" were published to promote songs reflecting reality in a timely manner. The publishing house also used forms popular with workers and peasants, such as lyrics and flower-lantern operas, to publish readings publicizing the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft).

    紧密结合工农业生产大跃进
    云南出版大量通俗读物
    云南人民出版社今年第一季度出版的五十三种书籍中，通俗读物占83％。
    这些通俗书籍的内容，一部分是紧密结合当前工农业生产大跃进的，其中有介绍农作物栽培技术、丰产经验和改良工具等方面的小册子，有供给下放干部和乡、社干部学习的“农业常识”和“农业基础知识”，有根据云南发展地方工业需要而出版的“云南有色金属工业资源的开采办法”和“化学肥料的种类及作法”等书。一部分是配合农村扫盲和开展群众性文艺活动而编著的扫盲教材和通俗文娱演唱材料。此外，还出版了不少阐述马列主义基本理论的通俗读物。
    为了使出版物及时反映和指导现实，迅速普及到工农群众中去，云南人民出版社采取了多种多样的出版形式。如结合农业生产节令出版了不定期的“科学普及农业技术活页资料”，为了及时推广反映现实的歌曲出版了“活页歌选”。出版社还利用工农群众喜闻乐见的唱词、花灯等形式出版了宣传全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的读物。
