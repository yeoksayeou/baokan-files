    Sparrow Eradication
    Xie Juezai
    Bamboo whips lash everywhere,
    Permitting no rest.
    Though fields are wide,
    There's no place for you to stand.
    Exhausted, hungry, and thirsty,
    You're easily caught, even if you don't die.
    Unless you have the strength,
    Fly to America.

    This poem was inspired by watching the sparrow eradication campaign in Chengdu.

    "Though the sparrow is small, its heart and courage are complete"; "The sparrows in Dongting Lake have weathered storms." This is to say that this sparrow fellow is quite clever and not easy to deal with. Farmers tie up straw men to scare sparrows, and hang metal objects that make noise when blown by the wind to startle them. It's effective at first, but they quickly realize it's fake and still fearlessly seek out their food. When I was a child, I was tasked with chasing away sparrows. This was during the threshing of rice and wheat. You chase them away from one side, and they eat on the other side; you go to chase them on that side, and they eat here again. If there are many sparrows, they simply bully the children, ignoring your shouts unless your whip is about to land on them. Usually, we would use small sticks to prop up a sieve to trap sparrows, but the result was often failure, instead giving them a good meal.

    Sparrows have a set of tactics. They nest near sources of grain, such as in the gaps in eaves, shrubs, or weeds next to houses. Seeing grain, they go there to eat, taking advantage of people's momentary carelessness. When the people were still "going it alone" and not organized, there were few ways to deal with sparrows, and those that existed were passive. When you had some grain, the rats stole it behind your back, and the sparrows snatched it in front of you. They were accomplices of the landlord class, yet also independently committed evil deeds apart from the landlord class.

    Since the "National Programme for Agricultural Development" proposed the elimination of the Four Pests, we have had great success in fighting sparrows. Sparrows are in a very unfavorable situation, but we are far from eliminating them. This is because our tactics are still general attacks rather than deploying an inescapable net. This sparrow fellow, seeing that the encirclement and suppression are not strict in a certain corner, and that there is an opportunity to exploit, goes there to "take shelter from the wind"; or lurks by your side (in the eaves and in the bushes) waiting for an opportunity. Therefore, it is necessary to fight like Chengdu, like Beijing, mobilizing everyone, shouting everywhere, so that sparrows have nowhere to stand and rest, cannot drink water, and cannot eat grain. Sparrows are also poor fliers, so this is how we can control their fate. We must also "empty the nests" and "smash the eggs" to "leave no survivors."

    This method is now being promoted throughout the country. This sparrow fellow will soon only be seen as specimens in museums.

    打麻雀
    谢觉哉到处竹鞭挥，许飞不许落。原野虽然宽，没你立足处。又累又饥渴，不死也易捕。除非你有劲，飞到美国去。
    这是在成都看打麻雀的诗。
    “麻雀虽小，肝胆俱全”；“洞庭湖里的麻雀，是经历过风浪的”。这是说麻雀这家伙，颇机灵、不易对付。农民缚个草人骇麻雀，挂个风吹动响的金属器惊麻雀，开始有点效，很快它就知道是假的，仍然无所顾忌地找它吃的东西。我小时候担任过赶麻雀的工作，那是打晒稻麦的时候，你在这边赶，它在那边吃；你到那边去赶，它又在这边吃。如果麻雀很多，那它简直欺负小孩子，尽管你吆喝，它不理，除非你的鞭子快要落在它的身上。在平时，我们用小棍支着筛子去罩麻雀，结果常常是落空，反而送给它饱餐一顿。
    麻雀是有一套战术的，它营巢在接近粮食的地方，如屋檐空隙、宅旁灌木或杂草里。见那里有粮，就到那里去吃，人们那一瞬间疏忽，它就在那一瞬间光临。当人民还是“单干”没有组织起来的时候，对付麻雀的办法是很少的，有也是被动的。你有点粮食，老鼠背着你偷，麻雀当着你抢，它们是地主阶级的帮凶，而又是离开地主阶级而独立作恶。
    自农业发展纲要提出消灭四害以来，我们对麻雀的战果是很大的，麻雀已处于很不利的境地，但离消灭还远。因为我们的战术还是一般突击，而不是布置了天罗地网。麻雀这家伙，见到那个角落围剿不严，有空子可钻，就去那里“躲风”；或者就潜伏在你的身边（屋檐里和草丛里）等待机会。因此必须像成都那样的作战、像北京市那样的作战，人人动员、处处吆喝，使麻雀无处立足休息、喝不到水、吃不到粮，麻雀飞翔的本事又差，这样，才能制它的命。我们还要“掏窝”“捣蛋”，使“无俾遗种”。
    这办法，现已在全国推行，麻雀这家伙，很快将只能在博物馆里的标本上看到。
