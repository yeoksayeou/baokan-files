    Tianshi Township Catches Up with the Advanced
    Lei Dan, Shu Lang
    Tianshi Township in Xuan'en County was a backward township known throughout the county for the past eight years. When the bugle of the Great Leap Forward sounded, Tianshi Township suddenly became a place praised by everyone. Everywhere you could see colorful fast-paced report posters, and everywhere you could hear new poems and new folk songs: "Work hard to open up new fields, transform barren mountains into rice and grain plains, each person gets 1,300 catties of grain, and the total output and income will double. Throw off the hat of grain shortage, and never be stained with the reputation of backwardness." This is a bold statement from the township's commune members.
    "Tianshi Township has many new atmospheres, the barren mountains and rocky ridges have undergone great changes, there are countless new fields, and manure piles stretch across the mountain slopes, doubling grain production is guaranteed, and everyone has a general impression: catching up from behind." This is a song of praise from the masses in neighboring townships.
    Tianshi Township used to be a place where "when it's sunny, it's like a knife, and when it rains, it's a mess." "Don't marry your daughter to the Lion's Palace, there's no water and little land." "If you don't reclaim wasteland for a year, the masses will drink vegetable soup." These were the proverbs that had been circulating among the masses for many years. However, the masses, inspired by an unprecedented revolutionary drive, transformed the overlapping sloping hills into a "mountains upon mountains from afar, fields stacked upon fields up close, rice paddies like mirrors embedded in the hills, every household has surplus grain and surplus money" rich mountain township. How could this not make people sing praises?
    Yes, people are unwilling to lag behind. The ancients said it well: "Everyone can become a Yao or Shun." "Those who are capable can do the same," "Where there's a will, there's a way." The key to the problem lies in leadership, in whether they have the determination to completely transform their thinking and style, rely on the masses, and bravely move forward to catch up! When the party branch secretary of Tianshi Township, Zheng Chengxiang, and the core leadership of the party branch, once lost their political direction and became lax and weak, when the branch secretary not only did not stop his family from engaging in sideline occupations outside for a long time, did not participate in the work of the commune, and abandoned his own work to immerse himself in business, planting a large amount of grain in his private plot, how could the masses trust him? Last year, during the socialist education movement carried out in the countryside, Zheng Chengxiang suddenly woke up, the branch was also rectified, and the party branch, having achieved new unity on a new ideological foundation, led the masses and bravely mounted the Great Leap Forward's steed, galloping forward.
    Winter production began. With a heroic spirit, the party branch put forward the inspiring battle cry to the masses: "Catch up with the advanced, take the lead, change the poor face within a year, and never be stained with the reputation of backwardness." Under the guidance of the party branch, the masses launched a great debate and great suggestion-making movement. People figuratively said: We suffer from lagging behind in two ways: The leader (cadre) is not upright; there is a shortage of grain. Now that the leader has been straightened, why worry about the body (masses) not being straightened? Right now, we must focus on the issue of grain production. Everyone unanimously agreed that vigorously carrying out dry-to-wet conversion and slope-to-terrace conversion was a permanent solution. Some of the masses lacked confidence, saying that there was no land to convert. The cadres personally went deep into the terrain to survey, each taking the lead in opening up a quarter of a mu of land first, thus finding various methods of converting land suitable to local conditions, so that the convertible land increased from 63 mu reported by the commune members at the beginning to more than 800 mu; some people worried about the lack of water, and branch secretary Zheng Chengxiang and township head Mao Yenkui said: Turn the water from the Yin River up! Regardless of the danger, the two of them drilled into the several-mile-long mountain cave to carefully survey, and more than a dozen male and female commune members who followed closely behind persevered in opening up the cave and dredging the Yin River in the dark cave where day and night were indistinguishable, and the more they worked, the more motivated they became; when there was a shortage of labor, old man Chen Tingxiu came up with the idea of using cattle to pull a rammer instead of people carrying it, and old man Tang Yiting also proposed the suggestion of using oxen to plow instead of people digging, which increased labor efficiency by more than ten times at once. A wave of comparing energy and drilling spirit, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced quickly swept the entire township, and those who did not love labor became the most labor-loving people. Commune member Qin Zhangjie, who had always held the intention of speculation and taking shortcuts to earn more with less work, now got up earlier and finished work later than anyone else.
    The sleeping lion of Tianshi Township was awakened by the bugle of the Great Leap Forward! It jumped to the first eight places in the county in one fell swoop!
    When inspection teams and visiting groups came to Tianshi Township one after another, repeatedly praising and learning from their experience, the commune members also repeatedly reminded each other: We can't lose the face we've picked up! When the local party committee inspection team said that their tea-oil trees had not been reclaimed and replanted, which was a shortcoming, good news was reported the next day: all 502 mu of tea-oil trees in the township had been reclaimed and replanted! When the provincial party committee's technical report team came to the key township of the Xuan'en County party committee to give technical reports, almost all the cadres above the team leader in Tianshi Township rushed to attend. Before the report was finished, they called back to the township to arrange for fertilizer accumulation. The cadres who stayed in the township mobilized overnight, and in less than three days, 1,200 more manure piles were added. They were not complacent and are continuing to move forward with big strides! (Reprinted from Hubei Daily, slightly abridged)

    天狮乡赶上先进
    雷丹　树浪
    宣恩县天狮乡本是一个八年来闻名全县的落后乡。大跃进的号角吹起，天狮乡猛然变成了人人称赞的地方，到处能看到五颜六色的快板报，到处能听到新诗歌、新民谣：“苦战苦斗开新田，荒山变成米粮川，每人粮食一千三，总产收入翻一番。缺粮帽子甩下山，落后名誉永不沾”。这是这个乡社员们的一席豪语。
    “天狮乡多新气象，荒山岩岭大变样，新田多得数不清，粪丘连绵在山包上，粮食翻一番有保障，人人有个总印象：后来居上”。这是邻乡群众的一首赞歌。
    天狮乡本是一个“天晴一把刀，下雨一团糟”的地方。“有女莫嫁狮子宫，既无水来又少田”“一年不开荒，群众喝菜汤”，这就是多年在群众中流传的谚语。可是，被空前革命干劲鼓舞起来的群众，一举就把重重叠叠的斜坡山岗，变成了一个“远看山重山，近看田叠田，水田似镜满岭嵌，户户余粮又余钱”的富饶的山乡。这怎能叫人不歌唱呢？
    是的，人是不甘落后的。古人说得好：“人皆可以为尧舜”。“有为者，亦若是”，“有志者，事竟成”。问题的关键在于领导，在于他们有没有决心彻底转变思想与作风，依靠群众，勇往直前的赶上去！当天狮乡的党支部书记郑成相和党支部的领导核心，一度迷失政治方向，涣散无力的时候，当支部书记不但不制止家里长期在外搞副业，不参加社里劳动和抛开自己的工作，埋头做买卖，在自留地里大种粮食的时候，难道能叫群众信任他吗？去年农村开展的社会主义教育运动，郑成相猛醒了，支部也整顿了，在新的思想基础上达到新的团结的党支部，领导着群众，勇敢的跨上了大跃进的骏马飞奔向前了。
    冬季生产开始了。党支部带着豪迈的心情，向群众提出了“赶先进，带头干，一年要把穷貌变，落后名誉永不沾”的振奋人心的战斗口号，在党支部的引导下，群众展开了一场大辩论、大献计运动。人们形象地说：我们落后就吃亏在两条上：龙头（干部）不正；缺粮。如今龙头摆好了，还愁龙身（群众）摆不巧？眼下就得打粮食的主意。大家一致认为大搞旱改水、坡改梯才是一劳永逸的正道。部分群众没信心，说无田可改，干部就亲自深入勘察地形，每人带头先开四分田，从而找出了因地制宜的、多种多样的改田方法，使可改田由开始社员自报的六十三亩增加到八百多亩；有人耽心无水，支部书记郑成相和乡长毛燕奎说：把阴河里的水翻上来！他们俩不顾危险，钻进几里长的山洞天坑中仔细勘察，紧跟上去的十几个男女社员，在昼夜难分的黑洞中，坚持开洞疏阴河，越干越有劲；劳动力不足了，陈廷秀老汉出了个用牛拉赶板代替人挑的主意，唐艺廷老汉也提出牛犁代人挖的建议，劳动效率一下子提高了十多倍，全乡迅速掀起了一个比干劲、比钻劲，学先进、赶先进的浪潮，不爱劳动的变成最爱劳动的人。一社社员覃章洁，一贯抱着投机取巧、少劳多收的打算，现在比谁都起得早、放工晚了。
    天狮乡这只长眠的雄狮，就这样在大跃进的号角中惊醒过来了！一跃而居全县的八个第一！
    当接二连三的检查团、参观团来到天狮乡，再三的赞扬和学习他们的经验时，社员们也再三的相互提醒着：面子拣起来了可不能再丢呵！当地委检查团说他们的油茶未垦复是个缺点时，第二天就传捷报：全乡五百零二亩油茶已经全部垦复出来了！省委技术报告团到宣恩县委重点乡作技术报告，天狮乡队长以上的干部几乎都涌去了，报告还未完毕，他们便打电话回乡安排积肥，留乡的干部们连夜动员，不到三天，堆肥又增加了一千二百处。他们没有自满，正继续大踏步地前进！（转载湖北日报，略有删改）
