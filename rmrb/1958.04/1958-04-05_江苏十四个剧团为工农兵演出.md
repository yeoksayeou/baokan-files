Fourteen state-run theaters in Jiangsu Province have recently begun to go deep into rural areas, market towns, factories, water conservancy construction sites, and military camps to conduct mobile performances for workers, peasants, and soldiers. These theaters plan to perform nearly five thousand shows in industrial and mining areas and rural areas this year, striving for ten million viewers.

This kind of mobile performance has greatly strengthened the relationship between the theaters and the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. A team from the Jiangsu Opera Troupe recently went to Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Liuhe County, helping farmers with production during the day and performing for them at night, which made the masses very happy. The actors of the Jiangsu Huai Opera Troupe helped train local grassroots cultural activists in the countryside, teaching farmers tunes, directing, and makeup skills.

All fourteen theaters are aiming to be self-sufficient and have a surplus this year. The Provincial Song and Dance Troupe used to perform in the city, and because ticket prices were high, the box office was not good. Now, performing in the countryside with tickets at only six cents apiece, the average daily income can reach about 350 yuan. The Provincial Huai Opera Troupe used to perform in the city, and even with high ticket prices, the average daily income was only about 140 yuan. Now, with teams going to the countryside, there are about 18,000 viewers per day, and the average ticket price is two cents, resulting in a daily income of about 400 yuan. This approach is very popular with the masses, who reflect, "The play is good, the money is little, and we don't have to run to the city to see a play!" (Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

    江苏十四个剧团为工农兵演出
    江苏省十四个国营剧团最近开始分别深入农村、集镇、工厂、水利工地和军队营地，为工农兵巡回演出。这些剧团今年计划在工矿区和农村演出近五千场，争取观众一千万人次。
    这种巡回演出大大密切了剧团和工农兵群众的关系，省锡剧团的一个队最近去六合县红光农业社，白天帮农民生产，晚上为农民演戏，群众非常高兴。省淮剧团的演员们在农村帮助训练当地文娱活动骨干分子，教给农民曲调、导演和化装知识。
    十四个剧团今年都要做到自给自足，并有盈余。省歌舞团过去在城里演出，因为票价高，卖座情况不好，现在农村演出，只六分钱一张票，平均每天可收入三百五十元左右。省淮剧团过去在城市演出，票价虽高，平均每天也只收入一百四十元左右；现在分队到农村，每天观众一万八千人左右，票价每张平均二分钱；一天收入四百元左右。这种作法，大受群众欢迎，他们反映：“戏又好，钱又少，看戏又不用向城里跑！”　（新华社）（附图片）
