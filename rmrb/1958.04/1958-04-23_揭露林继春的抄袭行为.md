    Exposing Lin Jichun's Plagiarism

    The article "Well-Deserved Reputation" published in the People's Daily supplement on March 26th, was originally a piece published in the 14th issue of "People's Posts and Telecommunications" in 1957. It praised Comrade Wang Peizhen, an advanced clerk at the Dongzhen branch of the Qingdao Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, for his good service attitude. The authors were Zhang Xiulin and two others. However, Lin Jichun of the Xiahuayuan Postal and Telecommunications Branch in Zhangjiakou, plagiarized it with a new guise and submitted it to both the Zhangjiakou Daily and the People's Daily for publication. Both times, he fabricated stories and forcibly attributed them to Comrades Wei Jinzhong of the Luoshuitan Postal Station and Bu Zhongyu of the Wucheng Street Branch. The entire article, except for the names and place names, was unchanged, even the title was not altered. (Editor's note: According to reader reports, Lin Jichun also submitted this article to the Hebei Daily, where it was published in the newspaper's supplement on March 18th under the title "Providing Convenience to Others.") This egregious act of plagiarism has not only caused a very negative impact among postal and telecommunications workers, but also damaged the credibility of the Party newspaper.
    Lin Jichun once said, "I'm trying to submit articles to the People's Daily, and getting one published will at least bring in five or six yuan." This clearly reveals his dirty soul.

    Editor's note: In addition to the letter from Comrade Bu Zhongyu and others, we have also received more than ten letters exposing Lin Jichun's plagiarism. We hope that Lin Jichun will examine his decadent bourgeois ideology and work style. We did not pay attention when publishing this article, which was an oversight on our part.

    揭露林继春的抄袭行为
    3月26日人民日报副刊上发表的“名不虚传”，原来是1957年第14期“人民邮电”上发表的一篇稿子，是表扬青岛市邮电局东镇支局先进营业员王培珍同志服务态度好的，作者是张秀林等三人；可是张家口下花园邮电支局的林继春却将它改头换面地抄袭下来，先后寄给张家口日报和人民日报发表。两次都用虚构的故事强加在落水滩邮电所魏晋忠和武城街支局卜仲瑜两个同志头上，全文除了名字和地名不同外，甚至连题目都没改。（编者按：据读者揭发，林继春还将此文投给河北日报，在今年3月18日该报副刊发表，题目改为“与人方便”。）这种恶劣的抄袭作风不仅在邮电职工中引起了极坏的影响，而且也破坏了党报的信誉。    林继春曾说过：“想法向人民日报投稿，得着一次（指刊载）至少也闹个五、六元。”这就不难看出他的肮脏的灵魂了。
    张家口市邮电局　卜仲瑜、张吉堂、凌云志、郭之涛、王彗贞、刘秀娟、马明
    编者按：除卜仲瑜等同志的来信外，我们还接到十多封来信揭露林继春的抄袭行为。我们希望林继春对自己这种腐朽的资产阶级思想作风进行检查。在发表这篇文章时，我们事先没有注意，这是我们工作上的疏忽。
