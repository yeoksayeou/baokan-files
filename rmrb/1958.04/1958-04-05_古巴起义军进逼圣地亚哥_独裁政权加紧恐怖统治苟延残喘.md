Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Havana dispatch: Cuban rebel forces advanced on Santiago, Cuba's second-largest city, on April 3rd in two routes.

    According to a communique issued by the rebel forces, one route of the rebel forces departed from the rebel forces' base in the Sierra Maestra mountains west of Santiago and is now approaching Santiago.

    Another force, led by Raul, the brother of rebel leader Castro, sabotaged the transportation around the sugar-producing city of Sagua de Tanamo and is advancing towards Santiago, fifty miles southwest of the city. This force numbers over one thousand men.

    The communique also stated that thousands of armed personnel in the rural areas of Oriente Province will soon march on Santiago.

    Terrified by the advance of the rebel forces, Batista's cabinet met until late into the night on April 3rd, intensifying the formulation of so-called "emergency period" orders to deal with the general strike called for by Castro. The government had previously announced a series of measures to deprive the people of their constitutional rights, and now it has further issued orders declaring that anyone participating in the general strike will permanently lose their jobs, and government personnel can arbitrarily shoot and kill striking workers.

    US Ambassador to Cuba Smith made a statement on April 3rd, openly encouraging the Batista government. He also said that the US government is "concerned about what will happen if the current Cuban government collapses." On the same day, a US State Department spokesman stated that the US government has not prohibited the shipment of all munitions to the Batista government.

    古巴起义军进逼圣地亚哥
    独裁政权加紧恐怖统治苟延残喘
    新华社4日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴起义部队3日分两路向古巴第二大城圣地亚哥挺进。
    据起义部队发表的公报说，起义部队一路从圣地亚哥西面马埃斯特腊山脉中起义部队的大本营出发，现在正逼近圣地亚哥。
    由起义部队领袖卡斯特罗的兄弟拉乌尔率领的另一路部队破坏了萨瓜德培那摩这座产糖城市周围的交通，并且正在向城西南五十英里的圣地亚哥挺进，这一路兵力有一千人之多。
    这项公报还说，奥连特省乡村地区的成千名武装人员不久也将向圣地亚哥进军。
    由于起义部队的进军而惊恐万分的巴蒂斯塔的内阁3日开会直到深夜，加紧制订所谓“紧急时期”的命令来对付卡斯特罗号召发动的总罢工。这个政府以前已经宣布了一系列措施来剥夺人民的宪法权利，现在它进一步发布命令，宣布任何参加总罢工的人将永远丧失职业，政府人员可以任意开枪射杀罢工工人。
    美国驻古巴大使史密斯3日发表谈话，公开为巴蒂斯塔政府打气。他同时说，美国政府对于“古巴现政府如果垮台将会发生什么事情感到关切”。同一天，美国国务院发言人表示，美国政府并没有禁止把一切军火运交巴蒂斯塔政府。
