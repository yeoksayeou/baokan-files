Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 4th: Indonesian President Sukarno reaffirmed on the evening of April 3rd at the State Palace, while addressing Indonesian university students, that Indonesia hopes to advance along the path of independence and unity.

President Sukarno delivered a speech on "How Students Should Meet the Challenges of the Times" to more than three thousand university students. He said that in the current international situation, all countries in the world must take the path of cooperation and peaceful coexistence. No country should take the destructive path of mutual hatred and the annihilation of humanity and civilization. He said that in this situation, Indonesia's choice is very clear.

Sukarno said that in the international social and economic sphere, we should also make a clear choice: a just society, or a society of human exploitation? The latter means allowing the existing imperialism and colonialism to continue, meaning that one country can oppress another.

Sukarno said, I am not a communist, but we must recognize the current era. Sukarno continued, after the First World War, the Soviet Union appeared, and after the Second World War, twelve other socialist countries appeared, and the national independence movements of Asian countries also rose. It should be said that the twentieth century is the era in which many countries have gained independence, the era in which socialist countries have been established, and the era of artificial earth satellites and the atomic age. Whoever cannot clearly see this trend will be crushed.

Speaking about Indonesia's domestic problems, Sukarno said that the current problem is to choose the path of national unity, or the path of division and disintegration. It is to choose a just and prosperous society, or a society exploited by new imperialism and new bourgeoisie. He said that Indonesia hopes to advance along the path of unity and independence.

He reiterated that the United States and the Soviet Union can coexist peacefully, but colonialist countries and colonized countries cannot coexist peacefully. He said that neutrality cannot be adopted towards colonialism.

He pointed out once again that a certain group opposes Indonesia's adoption of an independent policy.

He said that during his travels abroad, he personally saw a certain group attempting to pull Indonesia into their group.

President Sukarno said that the development of the rebel group is divided into four stages: first, using the name of local autonomy and local construction; then, putting forward anti-communist slogans; third, they tear off their masks and take anti-democratic measures such as assassinations and arrests; finally, they openly establish a counter-revolutionary government and collude with those who plan to drag Indonesia into a certain group. Sukarno said that a firm attitude must be taken towards the rebels.

This student rally was organized by the Student Action Committee Against the "Revolutionary Government." Participating in the rally were students from the University of Indonesia, military academies, and other colleges, as well as leaders of various political parties and government officials.

    苏加诺重申印度尼西亚国策
    要沿着独立和统一的道路前进
    指责叛乱分子同国际侵略集团蛇鼠一窝
    据新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺3日傍晚在国家宫对印度尼西亚大学生讲话时重申印度尼西亚希望沿着独立和统一的道路前进。
    苏加诺总统对三千多个大学生发表了关于“学生如何应付时代的挑战”的演讲。他说，在目前的国际局势下，世界各国一定要走合作和和平共处的道路。每一个国家都不应该走互相仇视和消灭人类和文明的毁灭性道路。他说，在这种局势下，印度尼西亚的选择是非常清楚的。
    苏加诺说，在国际社会经济方面，我们也应该作清楚的选择：公正的社会呢，还是人剥削人的社会？后者意味着允许现有的帝国主义和殖民主义继续存在下去，意味着一个国家可以压迫另一个国家。
    苏加诺说，我不是一个共产主义者，但我们一定要认清当前的时代。苏加诺继续说，在第一次世界大战后出现了苏联，第二次世界大战后，出现了其他十二个社会主义国家，并且亚洲国家的民族独立运动也高涨起来了。应该说，二十世纪是许多国家获得独立的时代，是社会主义国家建立的时代，而且是人造地球卫星和原子时代。谁要是不能够清楚地看到这种潮流，谁就要被粉碎。
    谈到印度尼西亚国内问题时，苏加诺说，当前的问题是要选择全国统一的道路呢，还是四分五裂的道路。是要选择公正和繁荣的社会呢，还是受新的帝国主义和新的资产阶级剥削的社会。他说，印度尼西亚是希望沿着统一和独立的道路前进的。
    他重申美国和苏联两个集团可以和平共处，但是殖民主义国家和受殖民主义统治的国家却不能和平共处。他说，对殖民主义是不能采取中立的。
    他再一次指出，某个集团反对印度尼西亚采取独立政策。
    他说，他在国外旅行期间，他亲眼看到了某个集团企图拉印度尼西亚参加他们的集团。
    苏加诺总统说，叛乱集团的发展分为四个阶段：首先利用地方自治和地方建设的名义；然后提出反共口号；第三，他们撕去他们的假面具并且采取如暗杀和逮捕等反民主的手段；最后，他们公开成立反革命政府，并且同那些策划把印度尼西亚拖进某个集团的人们串通合作，苏加诺说，对叛乱分子必须采取坚决态度。
    这次的学生集会是由学生反对“革命政府”行动委员会组织的。参加集会的有印度尼西亚大学、军事学院和其他学院的学生以及各政党领袖和政府官员们。
