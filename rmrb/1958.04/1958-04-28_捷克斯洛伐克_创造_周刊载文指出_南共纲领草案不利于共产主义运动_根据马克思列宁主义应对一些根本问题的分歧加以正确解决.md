Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 26th – A recent issue of the Czechoslovakian weekly "Creation" published an article by Rudolf Košťka and Karel Sýs entitled a commentary on the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The article pointed out that although the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has been modified to some extent, there has been no fundamental change in the attitude taken towards the issues contained in the draft program.

The article pointed out that the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has always emphasized that the common principles of Marxism-Leninism must be observed in socialist construction. The article wrote: "If we are to take a correct stand on any issue, the most fundamental thing we must always remember is the opposition between the two systems, their completely different social and economic content, and the policies they follow and implement."

When talking about the great achievements being made by the international revolutionary movement, the article emphasized that the reason for these achievements is not due to retreating from its ideology, but because it has victoriously repelled the most violent wave of revisionist attacks and adhered to the principles of Marxism-Leninism. The article wrote: "Marxism-Leninism is the theory of class struggle, in which we must never underestimate our class enemies, or even idealize them… or convince ourselves that some somewhat spontaneous so-called transition to socialism is taking place. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia has commented several times on the erroneous views of some Yugoslav comrades regarding 'capitalism growing into socialism', such as Todorovic's views. These and similar views have also been refuted by other Communist and Workers' Parties, but unfortunately we encounter these views again in the draft program."

The article refuted the view that the working class in capitalist countries can fundamentally influence the monopoly ruling groups, and pointed out that in fact, it is very obvious that the situation is just the opposite of this statement. "Modern capitalism has not lost its predatory nature." The concepts of the working class and the bourgeoisie, and their mutual relations, have not undergone any substantial changes. The article continued: "The maturity of the socialist material conditions in terms of productive forces cannot be confused with the socialist transformation of society, which can only be realized on the basis of the revolutionary struggle of the working class led by a Marxist-Leninist party. The program does not mention this."

When talking about the part of the program concerning the functions of the state and its institutions in capitalist countries, the article refuted the concept of the "supra-class" role of the state, and pointed out that the draft program omits the special role of the United States and American imperialism. The article wrote: "Nowhere else has the state and its institutions been so clearly subordinated to the financial oligarchy as in the United States."

The authors of the article pointed out that the draft program idealizes the bourgeois state in many places, while providing a one-sided and distorted description of the socialist state, merely emphasizing its negative aspects and exaggerating them.

When talking about the issue of the gradual demise of the state, the article said: "Our experience and the experience of other socialist countries have proven that the economic, cultural, and educational functions of the socialist state, and the importance of the socialist state's organizational functions, are increasing day by day, while the draft program alone believes that the importance of these functions is decreasing."

The article criticized the draft program for mechanically equating the party with mass social organizations, and quoted the views of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in June of last year, that "a true Marxist-Leninist party is not and cannot be merely a party of propaganda, but must also, and first and foremost, be a party of action, the organizer of the masses."

The "Creation" weekly article then pointed out that the recent modifications to the draft program (mainly on international political issues) are certain improvements on some issues. However, the fundamental shortcoming—ignoring the fundamental contradiction between the capitalist system and the socialist system—has not been eliminated. The article quoted the words in the draft program: "The contradiction between the capitalist system and the socialist system remains one of the decisive contradictions in modern international life," and then said that the authors of the draft program apparently believe that there are other equally decisive contradictions at present.

When talking about the imperialists' conspiracies and their policies of aggression against socialist countries, the article criticized the argument in the draft program about the issue of the two blocs. The article said that the primary common obligation of communists to the working class and people of their countries is to guarantee the achievements of socialism and to continue socialist construction victoriously.

Regarding the issue of economic relations between socialist countries, the authors of the article wrote: The draft program completely distorts the very progressive efforts of socialist countries in establishing and further strengthening the international division of labor, which is based on the unity of interests and goals, and deep solidarity and mutual benefit.

The article criticized the so-called "ideological monopoly" argument in the draft program. The article said: "As far as the term 'ideological monopoly' is concerned, it is essentially contrary to the universal laws and principles of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and thus also contrary to the ideological and political unity of the international communist movement."

Talking about the certain differences mentioned in the draft program that exist on certain theoretical and practical issues, the "Creation" weekly article said that the point of contention is that "certain differences" in viewpoints between individual communists or even entire parties should only be "differences that do not violate the ideological and political unity of the international communist movement, and the exchange of opinions among communists should always be guided by the Marxist-Leninist stand." Bringing views that are incompatible with Marxism-Leninism into the communist movement is harmful to this movement and to the development of socialism. Moreover, "if these views even develop into a complete system—no matter what the intentions of those who hold these views are, then they will objectively seriously threaten the interests of the working-class movement, weaken the unity of the international revolutionary proletarian front, and paralyze its joint actions."

The article finally pointed out that not only are there differences between certain conclusions of the draft program and the conclusions unanimously agreed upon by the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties on partial and non-essential issues, but there are also differences on some fundamental issues, and without correct resolution, there is no way to talk about unswervingly applying Marxism-Leninism. "Therefore, the Communists of Czechoslovakia naturally cannot conceal their different views on these issues. This does not mean that they will not positively evaluate everything done to reconcile with the Yugoslav Communists, or that they will abandon their efforts to cooperate with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and develop comradely relations. However, they will unswervingly pay attention to ensuring that this cooperation and relationship are established on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles."

### 捷克斯洛伐克“创造”周刊载文指出  南共纲领草案不利于共产主义运动  根据马克思列宁主义应对一些根本问题的分歧加以正确解决

    捷克斯洛伐克“创造”周刊载文指出
    南共纲领草案不利于共产主义运动
    根据马克思列宁主义应对一些根本问题的分歧加以正确解决
    新华社布拉格26日电  这里最近出版的一期“创造”周刊发表了鲁道夫·科什特卡和卡雷尔·斯尔森合写的一篇评论南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案的文章。文章指出，南共纲领草案虽然已经做了某些修改，但是对于纲领草案中包含的问题所采取的态度并没有原则上的改变。
    文章指出，捷克斯洛伐克共产党一向强调在社会主义建设中必须遵守马克思列宁主义的共同原则。文章写道：“如果我们要在任何问题上采取正确的立场，我们必须时时记住的最根本的事情就是两种制度之间、它们的完全不同的社会和经济内容之间以及它们所遵循和执行的方针之间的对立。”
    文章在谈到国际革命运动正在取得的重大成就时着重指出，所以取得这些成就并不是由于从它的思想意识上退却，而是由于它胜利地击退了修正主义进攻的最猛烈的浪潮和坚持了马克思列宁主义的原则。文章写道：“马克思列宁主义是阶级斗争的理论，在这个斗争中我们决不应当低估我们的阶级敌人，或者甚至把阶级敌人理想化……或者使我们自己相信某种多少有些自发的所谓向社会主义转变的过程正在进行中，捷克斯洛伐克共产党曾经好几次评论了南斯拉夫的某些同志关于‘资本主义长入社会主义’的错误看法，例如曾经评论过托多罗维奇的看法。这些看法和类似的看法也受到了其他共产党和工人党的反驳，但是不幸我们在纲领草案中又碰到这些看法了”。
    文章驳斥了所谓资本主义国家的工人阶级可以对垄断统治集团发生根本影响的看法，并且指出：事实上非常明显，情况与这种说法刚刚相反。“现代资本主义并没有失去它的掠夺性质。”工人阶级和资产阶级的概念、它们的相互关系，都没有经过什么实质的改变。文章接着写道：“不能把生产力方面的社会主义物质条件的成熟跟社会的社会主义改造混为一谈，后者是只能在马克思列宁主义政党所领导的工人阶级革命斗争的基础上才能实现的。关于这一点，纲领没有谈到。”
    在谈到纲领中关于资本主义国家中的国家及其机构的职能的那一部分时，文章驳斥了关于国家的“超阶级”作用的概念，并且指出，纲领草案中把美国和美帝国主义的特殊作用略而不提。文章写道：“任何其他地方都从来没有像美国这样明显地使国家及其机构绝对从属于金融寡头。”
    文章的作者指出，纲领草案在许多地方把资产阶级国家理想化了，而对社会主义国家却作了片面、歪曲的描述，仅仅强调它的消极方面并加以夸大。
    文章在谈到国家逐渐消亡的问题时说：“我们的经验以及其他社会主义国家的经验都证明，社会主义国家的经济、文化和教育职能，社会主义国家的组织者职能的重要性，正日益增加，而唯独纲领草案却认为这种职能的重要性日益减少。”
    文章批评了纲领草案机械地把党跟群众社会组织等同看待，并且引证了捷共去年6月间的意见，即
  “真正的马克思列宁主义政党不是、也不能是仅仅宣传的党，而必须同时、并首先是行动的党，是群众的组织者。”
    “创造”周刊的文章接着指出，不久前对纲领草案所作的修改（主要是关于国际政治问题的），是在一部分问题上的一定的改进。然而，根本的缺点——忽视资本主义制度和社会主义制度之间的基本矛盾——并没有消除。文章引证了纲领草案中的词句：“资本主义制度和社会主义制度之间的矛盾仍然是现代国际生活中决定性矛盾之一”，文章接着说，纲领草案的作者们显然认为目前还存在着其他同样具有决定性的矛盾。
    文章在谈到帝国主义者的阴谋和他们反对社会主义国家的侵略政策时批判了纲领草案中关于两种集团问题的论点。文章说，共产主义者对他们国家的工人阶级和人民的首要的共同义务就是保障社会主义的成就和胜利地继续进行社会主义建设。
    关于社会主义国家之间的经济关系问题，文章的作者写道：纲领草案完全歪曲了社会主义国家在建立和进一步加强国际分工方面具有非常进步意义的努力，这种分工的基础是利益和目标的一致以及深刻的团结一致和互利。
    文章批评了纲领草案中所谓“思想垄断”的说法。文章说：“就‘思想垄断’这一名词来说，它在本质上是违背社会主义革命和社会主义建设的普遍规律和原则的，从而也是违背国际共产主义运动思想上和政治上的团结的。”
    谈到纲领草案中所提到的在某些理论和实践问题上存在的某些分歧时，“创造”周刊的文章说，争执之点是：个别共产党人或者甚至整个党之间在观点上的“某些分歧”只应该是“不违背国际共产主义运动思想上和政治上的团结的分歧，在共产主义者当中交换意见永远应该以马克思列宁主义的立场为指导”。把同马克思列宁主义不相容的观点带到共产主义运动中来的做法，对这个运动和对社会主义的发展是有害的。而且“如果这种观点甚至发展成为完整的体系的话——不管持有这种观点的人们的意图是什么，那末它们就会在客观上十分严重地威胁工人阶级运动的利益，削弱国际革命无产阶级阵线的团结并且使它的共同行动陷于瘫痪。”
    文章最后指出，不仅在部分的和非实质的问题上纲领草案的某些结论与共产党和工人党的代表们所一致同意的结论之间有分歧，而且在一些根本问题上也有分歧，如果不加以正确的解决，那就谈不上坚持不渝地运用马克思列宁主义。“因此，捷克斯洛伐克共产党人自然不能隐讳他们在这些问题上的不同观点。这并不是说，他们就不会从积极方面来估计为了同南斯拉夫共产主义者言归于好所作的一切，或者说他们会放弃同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟进行合作以及发展同志式的关系的努力。然而他们将坚持不渝地注意使这种合作和关系建立在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上。”
