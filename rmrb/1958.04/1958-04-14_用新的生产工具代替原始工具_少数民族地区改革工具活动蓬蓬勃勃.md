Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The movement to reform production tools is flourishing among many ethnic minorities across the country.

"Flying in the sky and pushing on the ground" was a long-held dream of various ethnic minorities in the southern mountainous areas, and it has now become a reality. After the people of all ethnic groups in Xun甸(Xundian) Hui Autonomous County, Yunnan, erected aerial ropeways, they created various types of aerial vehicles, cable cars, winches, etc., operating on the ropeways. They also laid 140,000 meters of wooden and iron rails, on which push carts travel. Zhuang farmers in Rong'an County, Guangxi, also created bamboo rails for automatically transporting fertilizer.

Many ethnic minority areas have launched a mass upsurge in vehicle construction. Farmers of all ethnic groups contributed ideas and worked with their own hands to create many vehicles suitable for the terrain, roads, and human and animal power. Those ethnic minorities without their own carpenters and blacksmiths had Han craftsmen come from afar to teach them techniques. Now, the number of counties and townships achieving "vehicle-based transportation" is gradually increasing, and countless narrow mountain paths have been widened and leveled into roads suitable for vehicles. Zhuang farmers in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region call their vehicles "Leap Forward Vehicles" and the newly built roads "Socialist Roads," praising vehicle-based transportation with the saying, "Carrying a hundred on your shoulders makes you sweat, pushing two hundred on a cart makes your whole body light." In the rural areas inhabited by the Sala ethnic group in Qinghai Province, people have already put away the back baskets and sacks that have been used for thousands of years, and are universally using light handcarts, donkey carts, mule carts, and ox carts to transport earth and fertilizer. Some ethnic minorities in the border areas have vehicles for the first time in their history. They have learned to drive ox carts and horse carts from their Han brothers, making use of a large number of idle cattle and horses.

The production tool reform movement of some ethnic minorities is leaping forward, even surpassing the historical stages of development. The Naxi and Bai people in Lijiang County on the northwestern Yunnan Plateau are not only using walking plows and double-wheeled double-share plows to replace primitive wooden plows and harrows, but have also created combined universal threshing machines, ten-row seeders, and other machines, producing nearly a thousand new-style farm implement experts. The Kawa, Jingpo, Lisu, and other ethnic minorities on the Yunnan border, who have not used iron implements for very long, are also eliminating primitive production tools and carrying out a revolution in production technology.

    用新的生产工具代替原始工具
    少数民族地区改革工具活动蓬蓬勃勃
    据新华社讯　改革生产工具的运动正在全国许多少数民族中蓬勃发展。
    “天上飞、地下推”，是南方山区各少数民族多年的幻想，如今已成为现实。云南寻甸回族自治县各族人民架起高空索道以后，创制了好多种在索道上运转的飞车、缆车、绞车等，还铺设了十四万公尺的木轨和铁轨，行走推车。广西融安县的僮族农民也创制出自动运送肥料的竹轨。
    不少民族地区已经掀起群众性的造车热潮。各族农民人人献计，个个动手，造出许多适应地形、道路和人畜力的车辆。那些没有本民族木匠、铁匠的少数民族，便由远道而来的汉族手工业者传授技术。现在，实现“运输车子化”的县、乡正在逐渐增加，无数条羊肠小道加宽修平，变成了车路。广西僮族自治区的农民把车子叫做“跃进车”，把新修的车路叫做“社会主义道路”，拿“肩挑一百汗蒙蒙，车推二百一身轻”来赞扬车子化。在青海省撒拉族聚居的农村，人们已经收拾起沿用千年的背斗、麻袋，普遍用轻便的手推车、毛驴车、骡马车、牛车来运土送粪。还有些边疆的少数民族，有史以来第一次有了车辆，他们向汉族兄弟学会驾驭牛车、马车；把大量闲牛闲马加以利用。
    有些少数民族的生产工具改革运动，更是超越历史发展阶段向前跃进。滇西北高原上丽江县的纳西族、白族人民，不仅用步犁、双轮双铧犁来代替原始的木犁木耙，还创造了联合万能脱粒机、十行播种机等，涌现出近千名新式农具手。云南边疆的佧佤、景颇、傈僳等使用铁器时间还不长的少数民族，也正在革除原始生产工具，实行生产技术上的革命。
