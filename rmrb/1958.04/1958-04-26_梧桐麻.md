    Chinese parasol tree fiber is a fiber made from the bark of Chinese parasol tree branches. When harvesting, the branches are cut off with a knife, and the bark can then be peeled off to make the fiber. The best harvesting time is during the summer and autumn seasons. Chinese parasol tree fiber is of good quality, with fine fibers and strong tensile strength. In the past, farmers in some areas of Sichuan used it to replace hemp and jute to make hemp ropes for shoe soles. It is currently also supplied for export.

    梧桐麻
    梧桐麻是用梧桐树枝皮剥制的麻。采割时用刀剔下树枝，即可剥皮制麻。采割时间以夏、秋两季为最佳。梧桐麻的质量好、纤维细、拉力强，过去四川有些地区农民利用它代替大麻、青麻制成麻绳打鞋底，目前还供出口。
