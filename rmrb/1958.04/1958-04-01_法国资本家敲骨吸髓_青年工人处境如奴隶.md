Xinhua News Agency, 30th. André Mathiot, member of the National Executive Bureau of the French Communist Youth League, recently published an article in the weekly "New France" exposing the cruel exploitation of youth by French capitalists.

	The author said: Covert plunder through apprenticeship contracts is already commonplace in France. For example, a fourteen-year-old primary school graduate in the Yonne province is working as an "apprentice" in a restaurant, working thirteen to fifteen hours a day. Because the work is so intense, he can only eat in a hurry for ten minutes. Another example is Roger, an apprentice at the Simca automobile factory branch in Nantes. Although his apprenticeship has expired and he is doing the same work as workers earning 200 francs per hour, he can only get more than 50 francs per hour.
	Bosses also exploit young people through age-based wage differentials. Nineteen-year-old Marx has graduated from an industrial school and is a skilled worker who can do the same work as adult workers earning 250 francs per hour. However, he can only get 148 francs per hour. In just one month, the boss plundered 21,671 francs from him through the age-based wage differential system.
	The harsh working conditions, lack of safety facilities, and long hours of grueling labor in French factories and mines bring disaster to young people. Many young workers die in mine collapses and explosions, while others fall to their deaths from high places or are crushed to death by steel plates... To earn a little more wages, eighteen-year-olds have to work eleven hours a day under great pressure. Excessive work makes them exhausted and prematurely aged.
	Mathiot pointed out that this intolerable situation has led many young people to join the ranks of the struggle. They demand equal pay for equal work, reduced working hours, improved working conditions, and the abolition of the sweatshop system.

    法国资本家敲骨吸髓  青年工人处境如奴隶
    新华社30日讯　法国共产主义青年联盟全国执行局委员安德烈·马缪不久以前在“新法兰西”周刊发表文章，揭露了法国资本家对青年的残酷剥削。
    作者说：通过学徒合同进行隐蔽的掠夺，在法国已经是司空见惯的事。例如，云纳省一个十四岁的小学毕业生在一家饭馆里当“学徒”，每天工作十三小时至十五小时。由于工作十分紧张，他只能用十分钟的时间匆忙吃饭。又如在南特“西姆卡”汽车工厂分厂当学徒的罗歇，虽然见习期已经满，并且已经同每小时挣两百个法郎工资的工人作同样的工作，但是他只能拿到每小时五十多个法郎的工资。
    老板们还通过按年龄的工资差异制度对青年进行掠夺。十九岁的马克司已经从工业学校毕业，是个熟练工人，能够同每小时拿二百五十个法郎的成年工人同样工作。但是，他每小时只能拿到一百四十八个法郎。仅在一个月里，老板通过按年龄的工资差异制度就从他身上掠夺了两万一千六百七十一个法郎。
    法国工厂和矿山中劳动条件的恶劣、安全设施的缺乏以及漫长的血汗劳动给青年带来灾难。不少青年工人因为矿井塌陷和爆炸事故而死亡，还有从高处摔下身死的，被钢板压死的……多得一点工资，十八岁的青年每天不得不十分紧张地工作十一小时。过分工作使得他们筋疲力尽，未老先衰。
    马缪指出，这种令人不能忍受的状况使得许多青年参加了斗争的行列。他们要求同工同酬、减少工作时间、改善劳动条件和废除血汗制度。
