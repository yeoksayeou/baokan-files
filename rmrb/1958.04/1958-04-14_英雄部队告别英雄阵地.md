    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 12th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops who defended Shangganling paid solemn tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the Battle of Shangganling before returning to China.
    On the 7th, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army stationed on the front lines of Shangganling sent representatives to hold a memorial ceremony at the bunker where martyr Huang Jiguang sacrificed himself. The top of the bunker still has a hole blasted open by Huang Jiguang with a demolition charge, and several of the bunker's support pillars have been overturned to one side. The representatives cleaned the area around the bunker and erected a large wooden sign next to it that read "Martyr Huang Jiguang Will Live Forever." Zhai Mingquan, the company commander of a model company who had been awarded first-class merit twice, swore an oath to martyr Huang Jiguang in front of the bunker: "Over the past few years, the thought of defending the position you recaptured with your body has increased our sense of honor and responsibility. After we return to China, your spirit will continue to encourage us to complete the tasks given to us by the people of the motherland and continue to maintain the title of 'the most beloved people'." Representatives from various companies also expressed their determination in front of the bunker.
    Officers and soldier representatives of the Volunteer Army units guarding Shangganling swept the "Shangganling Volunteer Army Martyrs Cemetery." Buried here are the soldier Chen Zhiguo, who used his wounded body as a machine gun firing platform in battle, the telephone operator Niu Baocai, who kept the telephone wire in his mouth to ensure communication before sacrificing himself, and many anonymous heroes who died with the enemy.

    英雄部队告别英雄阵地
    新华社平壤12日电　守卫上甘岭的中国人民志愿军部队在归国以前，向牺牲在上甘岭战斗中的烈士们进行了庄严的告别。
    7日，驻守上甘岭前沿阵地的志愿军某部，派代表到黄继光烈士牺牲的地堡上举行了祭奠。这个地堡的顶盖上还留着一个被黄继光用爆破筒炸开的窟窿，有几根地堡顶柱被炸翻在一边。代表们清扫了地堡的四周，在旁边竖立了一块“黄继光烈士永垂不朽”的大木牌。曾立过两次一等功的某模范连连长翟鸣泉在地堡前向黄继光烈士宣誓说：“几年来，我们一想到是守卫在你以身驱夺回来的阵地上，就增加了荣誉感和责任感。当我们回国以后，你的精神仍将鼓舞我们继续完成祖国人民给予的任务，继续保持“最可爱的人”的称号。各个连队的代表也纷纷在地堡前表示了决心。
    守卫上甘岭的志愿军各部队军官和战士代表，祭扫了“上甘岭志愿军烈士陵园”。长眠在这里的，有在战斗中把自己负伤的身体当作机枪射击台的战士陈治国，有牺牲前嘴里噙着电话线头保证通话的电话员牛保才，以及许多和敌人同归于尽的无名英雄。
