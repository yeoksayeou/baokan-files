    More Research on the Matter of Eating

    After liberation, the yield of rice, our country's main grain crop, has increased greatly. To comprehensively solve the problem of eating, attention must also be paid to the properties of the grain. For example, the "Lao Lai Qing" variety of late-season rice has a soft and smooth texture and can be made into excellent pastries and refreshments. However, it also has shortcomings: it is not very filling and is not suitable for manual laborers. I hope that nutritionists and other related scientists will do more research on the matter of eating, such as how to use mixed grains for cooking to make food more filling, and, based on the situation of eating less in hot weather and more in cold weather, research what kind of eating methods can save food.

    Practice Diligence and Thrift in Running Kindergartens

    After reading the article "Compare Diligence and Thrift in Running Kindergartens, Compare Education Quality" on page 7 of the People's Daily on March 7, I found that the criticism of the serious waste in our kindergarten is incompatible with the principle of running all undertakings with diligence and thrift. Combining this with the "Double-Anti" movement, we put forward the slogan "Fight hard for three days to change the backward face of our kindergarten." We first improved administrative management and staffing. Now, the number of staff has been reduced from 41 to 20. The number of children served by each staff member has increased from 1.22 to 5. In the past, the government subsidized each child 55 yuan and 58 fen; now it has been reduced to 7 yuan and 6 jiao.

    多研究吃的问题
    我国主要的粮食作物——水稻，解放后产量增加很大。要全面地解决吃的问题，对粮食的性能也要注意。如连作晚稻中的“老来青”品种，质地柔滑，可以制成优良的糕点茶食；但它也有缺点，就是耐饥力差，对体力劳动者说来不适宜。我希望营养学界和其他有关科学家多研究吃的问题，如怎样利用粮食混合煮作可以耐饥，以及根据天热少吃、天冷多吃的情况，研究出怎样的吃法可以节省食物。

    实行勤俭办园
    读了3月7日人民日报第七版“比勤俭办园，比教育质量”一文，其中批评我所浪费现象相当严重，这与勤俭办一切事业的方针是不相容的。我们结合双反运动，提出了“苦战三天，改变我所落后面貌”的号召。我们首先从行政管理和人员配备上进行了改进。现在，工作人员已由四十一人减少到二十人。每个工作人员服务的儿童人数，由一点二二人增加到五人。过去每个儿童由公家补助五十五元五角八分，现在减到七元六角。
