The American Underworld

    Political Persecution at the City College of New York

    The American weekly "The Nation" reported in its March issue the political persecution suffered by Warren Austin, a professor at the City College of New York. It is not difficult for people to see from the experience of this American professor that the ghost of McCarthy is still directing the crazy band to play the tune of political persecution.

    Warren Austin is a professor in the English Department of the City College of New York. He graduated from the school in 1931 and has been teaching there ever since. The New York City Board of Higher Education had twice asked him, in September 1954 and June 1955, whether he had participated in the May Day parade in 1937, and investigated his relationship with Sharps, another teacher at the City College of New York. Austin replied that he had participated in the May Day parade twenty years ago, and that Sharps was his supervisor, designated by the school when he first started teaching. Austin said that he later learned that Sharps was a communist, but Austin himself neither joined the Communist Party nor participated in any Communist Party activities.

    This was the beginning of political persecution.

    On May 20, 1957, the New York City Board of Higher Education asked Austin if he was prepared to resign. Austin replied that he had no intention of doing so. The next day, the New York City Board of Higher Education sent someone to the City College of New York, accompanied by a representative from the school, to call Austin out of the classroom and hand him a dismissal letter. Austin's crime was "lacking the character of a university teacher." Due to Austin's firm protest, the Board of Higher Education established an inquiry committee. The work of the inquiry committee continued intermittently until the end of 1957, and finally produced a report concluding that Austin was "guilty."

    The report stated: "Austin had studied Russian at Jefferson College, and the Russian course had no significant relationship to his work as an English lecturer at the university..."

    In fact, in addition to Russian, Austin also studied French and Italian. In the United States, learning Russian is actually considered a basis for conviction.

    The report also listed the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Sharps had visited Austin's home once as evidence of guilt.

    The report stated: "...If the facts obtained in the Austin case inquiry are viewed in isolation, they are not sufficient to prove the points with which Austin is charged. However, if these facts are observed comprehensively, a different assessment can be made..." The so-called facts are that Austin participated in the May Day parade twenty years ago, and according to "The New York Times," no less than 70,000 New Yorkers participated in the May Day parade that year. The so-called facts are that Austin studied Russian and read some progressive books!

    On December 16, 1957, the New York City Board of Higher Education officially dismissed Austin from his professorship and work at the City College of New York, and did not retroactively pay his salary during the suspension period. Austin's daughter originally worked for the New York "American Telephone and Telegraph Company." Because of her father's case, she was also fired by the company. She is now working as a saleswoman in a department store. (Le Shan)

    纽约市立大学的政治迫害
    3月份一期的美国“民族”周刊报道了纽约市立大学教授华伦·奥斯汀遭受政治迫害的经过。人们不难从这位美国教授的遭遇里看出，麦卡锡的幽灵仍在指挥着疯狂的乐队奏出政治迫害的曲调。
    华伦·奥斯汀是纽约市立大学英文系教授。他于1931年在该校毕业，以后一直在该校任教。纽约市高等教育局曾于1954年9月和1955年6月先后两次询问他是否参加过1937年的“五一”节游行，并追查他与纽约市立大学另一位教师夏普斯的关系。奥斯汀回答说，他参加过二十年以前的“五一”节游行，又说在他任教的初期，夏普斯是由校方指定的、他的指导者。奥斯汀说，后来他才知道夏普斯是一名共产党员，不过奥斯汀本人既未加入共产党，也没有参加过共产党的活动。
    这是政治迫害的开端。
    1957年5月20日，纽约市高等教育局询问奥斯汀是否准备辞职。奥斯汀答称毫无此意。第二天，纽约市高等教育局派人前往纽约市立大学，在校方代表陪同下把奥斯汀从教室里叫了出来，把解雇书交给他。奥斯汀的罪名是“有失大学教师的品德”。由于奥斯汀的坚决抗议，高等教育局设立了一个讯问委员会。讯问委员会的工作断断续续地进行到1957年年底，最后作出了一份报告书，认为奥斯汀“有罪”。
    报告书说：“奥斯汀曾在杰斐逊学院进修俄文，而俄文这项课程与他在大学里所担任的英文讲师工作并无显著的关系……。”
    事实上，除了俄文以外，奥斯汀还学习过法文、意大利文。在美国，学习俄文竟被认为是定罪的根据。
    报告书里还把夏普斯夫妇曾到奥斯汀家中去过一次列为罪证。
    报告书说：“……如果孤立地、隔离地来看待奥斯汀案讯问中得出的诸项事实，不足以证实奥斯汀被控的各点。可是，把这些事实综合起来观察，就可以得出不同的估计……。”所谓事实就是奥斯汀参加过二十年前的“五一”节游行，而据“纽约时报”的记载，那一年参加“五一”节游行的纽约市民不下七万人。所谓事实就是奥斯汀学习过俄文、阅读过一些进步的书籍！
    1957年12月16日，纽约市高等教育局正式解除了奥斯汀在纽约市立大学的教授职务与工作，并且不予补发停职时期的薪津。奥斯汀的女儿本来在纽约“美国电话电报公司”工作。由于父亲的案件，她也被公司解雇了。现在她在一个百货公司充当售货员。　（乐　山）
