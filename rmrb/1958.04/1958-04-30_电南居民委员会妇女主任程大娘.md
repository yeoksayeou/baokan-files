    Aunt Cheng, Women's Director of Diannan Residents Committee

    More than one hundred impoverished people in the Diannan Residents Committee of Gulou District, Xuzhou, who used to rely on government relief to survive, are now living on their own earned income. When people in this area mention the improvement in their lives, they all say that it is inseparable from Aunt Cheng, the women's director of the residents committee.

    Originally, in 1956, when the government called for organizing production for self-salvation, Aunt Cheng immediately and actively led everyone to find ways to produce. Regardless of the sweltering heat that made sweat pour down like rain, regardless of the freezing cold that made her shiver, she always took the lead in running around everywhere to find production opportunities. Once, she ran all over the coal and iron mines near Xuzhou in search of production opportunities. In the end, she ran out of money, and didn't have enough for transportation or food, so she went hungry and ran back from dozens of miles away. Sometimes, when she and everyone else found some "raw materials" that people had thrown away like garbage, others disliked them for being dirty and smelly, but she didn't care at all and took the lead in carrying them back. As long as she was there, many raw materials that could be carried back by human labor were, under her leadership, carried back by themselves to save on transportation costs.

    After the raw materials were carried back, sometimes it snowed, and production could not be carried out in the open. She gave up her own house, and fearing that everyone would be cold, she took the initiative to light a stove. Under her influence and leadership, the group members were deeply moved, production became more active, and production developed more quickly.

    电南居民委员会妇女主任程大娘
    徐州市鼓楼区电南居民委员会一百多个依靠政府救济为生的贫民，现在靠自己的劳动收入生活了。这一带的人们一提起这些人生活改善的情况，都说，这和居民委员会妇女主任程大娘分不开。
    原来1956年，政府号召组织生产自救，程大娘马上就积极领导大家想办法生产。不管大热天热得汗如雨下，不管大冷天冷得身上发抖，为了找寻生产门路，她总是带头到处奔走。有一次，她跑遍了徐州市附近的煤矿、铁矿去找生产门路，最后，身上的钱用完了，车费、伙食费都没有，她就饿着肚子从几十里外跑回来。有时，当她和大家一起找到一些被人家像垃圾一样扔了的“原料”时，别人嫌脏嫌臭，她却毫不在乎带头往回扛。只要有她在，许多能够用人力扛回来的原料为了节省运费都是在她带动下，自己扛回来。
    原料扛回来了，有时天下雪，露天不能生产，她就把自己家里的房子让出来，还怕大家冷，主动生起火炉，就在她的影响带动之下组员们深受感动，生产更加积极，生产更快地发展起来了。
