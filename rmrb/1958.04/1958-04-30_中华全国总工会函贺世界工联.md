Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a congratulatory letter to the World Federation of Trade Unions for May Day. The full text is as follows: Dear Comrade Saillant,

	On the occasion of the upcoming great festival of the international working class – May Day International Labor Day, I would like to extend warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese working class to the World Federation of Trade Unions – the loyal defender of the interests of the working class of all countries.

	The Chinese working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, is launching a new production upsurge throughout the country with a leap-forward spirit, striving to complete and overfulfill the first annual plan targets of the Second Five-Year Plan, and striving to catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little more. The Chinese working class is loyal to its international obligations and will unswervingly work to develop friendly cooperation between the workers and trade union movements of all countries, to unite the international trade union movement, and to safeguard world peace.

	On the eve of this great festival, I wish the World Federation of Trade Unions greater contributions in the struggle to maintain world peace, to strive for the cessation of nuclear weapons tests and the prohibition of the use of weapons of mass destruction, and in supporting the struggle against colonialism and for national independence. I wish the World Federation of Trade Unions new achievements in the struggle to improve the economic and social status of the working people and to meet their urgent demands, and in promoting friendly cooperation and international unity among the workers and trade unions of all countries.
	
	Long live May Day International Labor Day!
	Long live the unity of the international working class!
		All-China Federation of Trade Unions, April 17, 1958

    值此国际工人阶级的伟大节日——“五一”劳动节即将来临之际，谨代表中国工人阶级向世界工联——世界各国工人阶级利益的忠诚捍卫者致以热烈的祝贺。
    中国工人阶级，在中国共产党的领导下，正以跃进的精神在全国范围内掀起新的生产高潮，争取完成和超额完成第二个五年计划的第一年度计划指标，争取在十五年或者更多一点时间内在钢铁及其他主要工业生产品方面赶上或者超过英国。中国工人阶级忠实于自己的国际义务，它将始终不渝地为发展各国工人和工会运动之间的友好合作和国际工会运动的统一团结，为维护世界和平而努力。
    在此伟大节日的前夕，谨祝世界工联在维护世界和平、争取停止试验核武器和禁止使用大规模毁灭性武器的斗争中，在支持反殖民主义和民族独立的斗争方面作出更大的贡献。祝世界工联在争取提高劳动人民的经济和社会地位以及为满足劳动人民的迫切要求的斗争中，在促进各国工人和工会之间的友好合作和国际团结方面取得新的成就。
      “五一”国际劳动节万岁！
    国际工人阶级团结万岁！
                        中华全国总工会　1958年4月17日
