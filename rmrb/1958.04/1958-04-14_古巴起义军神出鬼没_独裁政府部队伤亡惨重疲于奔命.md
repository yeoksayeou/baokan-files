Xinhua News Agency, April 13th dispatch from Havana: Cuban insurgent forces continue to launch attacks against the Batista dictatorial regime's army in many parts of the country.

During the popular armed uprising in Santiago on the 10th, the Batista dictatorial regime mobilized a large number of military police and motorcycle units to prevent the insurgents from seizing the city. The uprising was large in scale and well-organized. The insurgents attacked government troops and police cars, attacked prisons, and engaged in street fighting. Only under the fierce firepower of the government military police did the insurgents retreat outside the city, but the fighting continues. On the 11th, Castro's insurgent forces briefly occupied Cobre, about twenty-five miles west of Santiago, and destroyed an armory storing 60,000 pounds of explosives.

It is reported that insurgent forces also landed and fought in two seaports on the night of the 11th and the early morning of the 12th. Approximately 500 insurgents landed at Sagua la Grande, in central Cuba, about 50 kilometers from Santa Clara, the capital of Las Villas province, and attacked four towns in the area, with fierce fighting. Another force of about 900 men landed at the port of Sagua de Tánamo on the southeast coast of Cuba.

The insurgent forces adopted disruptive tactics, exhausting the government troops.

A spokesman for the Batista dictatorial regime admitted that government troops have suffered heavy casualties so far. The Batista dictatorial regime has also transferred the guard forces from sugar factories to combat and incorporated secret police and court bailiffs into the police force.

The armed uprisings in Havana and Santiago have received widespread support from the people. The uprising in Santiago was particularly extensive. Before the armed uprising began, workers in transportation and commerce went on strike, businesses closed, traffic was completely paralyzed, and all stores, schools, etc., were completely closed. Although the military police forced the stores to open with guns, few workers returned to work.

The Cuban dictatorial regime is now using bloody massacres to persecute the people who participated in the uprising and strikes. According to a report by the United Press, in Havana, many sympathizers of the armed uprising were killed, including three church leaders.

    古巴起义军神出鬼没
    独裁政府部队伤亡惨重疲于奔命
    新华社13日讯　哈瓦那消息：古巴起义部队继续在全国许多地方向巴蒂斯塔独裁政权军队展开攻击。
    在圣地亚哥10日的人民武装起义中，巴蒂斯塔独裁政权调动了大批军警和摩托部队，才阻止了起义者夺取这座城市。起义的规模很大，而且是有组织的。起义者袭击政府军队和警车，袭击监狱，进行巷战，只是在政府军警的猛烈火力下，起义者才退到城外，但是战斗还在继续。11日卡斯特罗的起义部队一度攻占了圣地亚哥西面约二十五英里的科布拉，并将一个储有六万磅炸药的军火库炸毁。
    据报道，起义部队还在11日夜间和12日清晨分别在两个海港登陆作战。起义部队大约五百人在古巴中部距离拉斯维利亚斯省省会圣克拉拉约五十公里的大萨瓜港登陆，对该地区四个市镇进行攻击，战斗激烈。另有约九百人的一支部队在古巴东南海岸的萨瓜德塔纳莫港登陆。
    起义部队采取了扰乱战术，使政府军队疲于奔命。
    巴蒂斯塔独裁政权发言人承认，到现在为止政府军队已经遭到重大伤亡。巴蒂斯塔独裁政权已经把制糖厂的警卫部队也调去作战，并且把秘密警察和法警都编入了警察部队。
    哈瓦那和圣地亚哥的武装起义都得到人民的广泛支持。圣地亚哥的起义范围尤其广泛，在武装起义开始前，交通运输业和商业等职工罢工、罢市，交通完全停顿，所有商店、学校等完全停闭，尽管军警用枪迫着商店开门，但是很少职工复工。
    古巴独裁政权现在正用血腥屠杀手段来残害参加起义和罢工的人民。据合众社报道，在哈瓦那，许多武装起义的同情者被杀死，其中还包括三个教会领袖。
