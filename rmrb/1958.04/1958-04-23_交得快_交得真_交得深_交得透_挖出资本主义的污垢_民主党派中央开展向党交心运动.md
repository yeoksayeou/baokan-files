Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd: The central committees of various democratic parties began a heart-to-heart campaign with the Party a week ago. This movement has only been underway for a week, but it has already yielded considerable gains. People generally reflect: the more they dig, the more they feel they have problems; the more they feel the need to dig out the filth of the bourgeoisie; the deeper and more thoroughly they dig, the faster and more truly they hand things over, and they immediately feel that their thinking is closer to the Party and to socialism, and their mood becomes even more cheerful.

The centralized heart-to-heart campaign of the central committees of the democratic parties began on April 14th, after learning from the experience of the centralized heart-to-heart campaign of democratic parties and industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin. In the days of heart-to-heart talks, the central committees of the democratic parties put forward many slogans to their members, such as: "Think about where you are half-hearted towards the Party?" "Be a promoter in the self-transformation movement, and a vanguard in the heart-to-heart campaign with the Party." The members of the democratic parties appeared particularly active, expressing their determination to hand things over quickly, truly, deeply, and thoroughly, and to realize their previously proposed promise of "giving their hearts to the Party" with practical actions, forming a high tide of heart-to-heart talks.

Leaders, members of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, members of the Central Committee, and staff members of the central organs, as well as students of the Socialist Academy of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang (民革), China Democratic League (民盟), China Association for Promoting Democracy (民进), Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party (农工), China Zhi Gong Party (致公), Jiusan Society (九三), and Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (台盟) all joined this movement. They were divided into groups to hold discussions together, helping and enlightening each other, while consciously pouring out things that had been hidden in their hearts for a long time. Now, thousands of large and small-character posters have appeared in the central committees of the democratic parties, revealing the problems. The problems revealed are very broad, including a large number of issues related to the bourgeois political stance. Among these issues are many ideological activities during the high tide of the Three Great Transformations and the anti-Rightist struggle, most of which have never been spoken out before. The actions of the democratic party members in handing over these things show their determination to transform themselves. Many people have once again realized that only by placing all these dirty things in the sunlight to eliminate them can they transform their thinking, become both red and expert, and become leftists.

Those who are engaged in heart-to-heart talks have realized that it is not easy to hand over the true state of mind without reservation, that this is a struggle to change one's position, and that to win this struggle, one must continue to deeply understand the current situation of the all-round great leap forward in socialism; while resolving to hand over one's heart, one must also dispel unnecessary concerns such as fear that the Party and the masses will not believe in oneself after exposing mistakes, fear of losing face, and fear of lowering prestige. Only in this way can one boldly dig out the filth of capitalism.

The personal heart-to-heart campaign has not yet ended. The central committees of the democratic parties are preparing to use this great situation to continue to deepen the heart-to-heart campaign, set off the second high tide of the heart-to-heart campaign, make the heart-to-heart campaign deeper and more thorough, and then carry out self-examination, analysis, criticism, and mutual assistance, and launch debates on some major issues to improve the level of awareness, and finally, on the basis of everyone's improved awareness, concentrate efforts to formulate and revise personal plans for self-transformation.

### 交得快　交得真　交得深　交得透  挖出资本主义的污垢  民主党派中央开展向党交心运动

    交得快　交得真　交得深　交得透
    挖出资本主义的污垢
    民主党派中央开展向党交心运动
    据新华社22日讯　各民主党派中央在一周前开始掀起一个向党交心的运动。这个运动刚进行一周，但已经有了不少收获。人们普遍反映：越挖越感到自己问题多，越感到挖出资产阶级污垢的必要；挖得越深越透，交得越快越真，马上就觉得自己的思想同党同社会主义靠近了一步，心情也越发舒畅。
    各民主党派中央的集中交心运动是学习了天津民主党派和工商界人士集中交心的经验后，从4月14日开始的。在交心的几天里，各民主党派中央都向各自的成员提出了许多口号如：“想一想，你在哪些地方同党三心二意？”“在自我改造运动中当促进派，在向党交心运动中当急先锋。”各民主党派成员们显得特别活跃，纷纷表示要做到交得快、交得真、交得深和交得透，用实际行动实现自己曾经提出的“把心交给党”的诺言，形成交心高潮。
    民革、民盟、民进、农工、致公、九三、台盟等民主党派中央的领导人、中央常务委员、中央委员和中央机关工作人员，以及社会主义学院的学员都投入了这一运动。他们分成小组，一面一起座谈、互相帮助和互相启发，一面便自觉地倾倒出长期隐藏在内心的东西。现在，各民主党派中央已经出现了成千上万张交心的大字报和小字报。交出的问题很广泛，其中有大量的关于资产阶级政治立场的问题。在这些问题中许多是三大改造高潮中和反右派斗争中的思想活动情况，大多是过去从来没有说出过的。民主党派成员交出这些东西的行动，表明了他们改造自己的决心。许多人再一次认识到，只有把这些脏东西全部摆到阳光下消灭干净，才能够改造自己的思想，才能够又红又专，成为左派。
    交心的人们体会到，要把真实的思想情况毫无保留地交出来，这是一个改变立场的斗争，是不容易的，要在这个斗争中得到胜利，必须继续深刻认识当前社会主义全面大跃进的形势；在下决心交心的同时，还需解除怕暴露出错误后党和群众会不相信自己，怕丢面子和威信降低等不必要的顾虑。这样才能大胆把资本主义的污垢挖出来。
    目前个人交心运动还没有结束。各民主党派中央准备利用这个大好形势，把交心运动继续深入进行掀起交心运动的第二个高潮，把交心运动搞得更深更透，然后进行自我检查、分析、批判和互相帮助，并就一些重大问题展开辩论，使觉悟水平提高一步，最后在大家觉悟提高的基础上，集中力量制订和修订自我改造的个人规划。
