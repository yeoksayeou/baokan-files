    How Exactly Should We Undertake Labor Training?
    Labor Cannot Spontaneously Transform Thought
    I am a cadre from the Chinese Academy of Sciences who was sent to the countryside. Last December, when I first went down to the Taihang Mountains to participate in labor, I mistakenly believed that labor training could naturally transform my thinking, and I relaxed and neglected the conscious effort to seize every important opportunity and link in the process of labor training, to actively carry out ideological struggle and conduct ideological remolding. Later, after a period of labor and the leadership pointing out that I should consciously transform my thinking through labor training, my thinking and actions began to show obvious changes. Now, I will talk about my experience of the relationship between labor training and ideological remolding.
    Ideological remolding is the driving force and guarantee of labor training. Labor training certainly creates and provides favorable conditions for ideological remolding, but labor training itself cannot spontaneously transform our thinking. This is not only because any kind of labor production will not spontaneously produce socialist and communist ideas, but more importantly, because the bourgeois viewpoints existing in our minds constantly hinder us from actively and correctly treating labor training from all aspects, hindering the growth and development of new ideological viewpoints in the process of labor training. For example, after hearing some commune members complain that they could earn more than one yuan a day by doing sideline production, but only get paid four jiao per work point in the commune, I had a subconscious sympathy in my mind from the one-sided understanding of improving farmers' living standards. For another example, in labor training, I felt that because there was not much time for study, the phenomenon of professional neglect was significant, but the phenomenon of ideological improvement was not significant, so I once had the wrong idea that going down to the countryside for training was not as good as studying and working in the office. After repeated study of documents, especially after consciously carrying out ideological struggle, these ideological problems were fundamentally solved. Similar ideological problems are constantly occurring in the process of labor training, and depending on one's own state of spontaneous or conscious thought, they arise and fall, or appear and develop in a clear or obscure manner. Only if we constantly and comprehensively maintain socialist consciousness can these ideological problems tend to disappear through repeated struggles, our thinking can be improved through labor training, the gains of ideological remolding can be accumulated and consolidated, and more arduous labor training can be happily persisted in for a long time with greater enthusiasm and determination. Therefore, in labor training, as in other occasions, we must always be vigilant against the erosion of old ideas from all aspects, we must always maintain the socialist consciousness of thoroughly remolding our thinking, and we must constantly systematize, consolidate, and persist in all consciousness for a long time.
    The ways and paths of ideological remolding are diverse, but labor training, especially long-term, arduous labor training, provides the most favorable conditions and environment for ideological remolding. In the early stage of going down to the countryside, I once thought that labor training was not about winning championships or抢工分 (snatching work points), and that work must be done "according to one's ability." As a result, I showed right-leaning conservative thinking everywhere in attendance rate and workload. As a result, labor training that was not arduous enough and not continuous enough did not touch my thinking much, and the gains were also very small. Later, under the correct criticism and instructions of the leadership, I began to change my ideological understanding and attitude towards labor training. Whether in attendance rate or workload, I insisted on resisting and persevering to the maximum extent of my growing physical strength. As a result, I not only initially broke through the barrier of heavy labor, completing the target set by the leadership ten days ahead of schedule in terms of attendance rate, and reaching the production target of a full labor force in chopping grass and carrying soil over short distances. In terms of labor attitude, I was praised by the agricultural cooperative for insisting on carrying manure in the snow and leading the commune members to work together. Moreover, more importantly, I gained a lot in ideological remolding. This is primarily because continuous and arduous labor is most likely to touch my spoiled bourgeois thinking, thereby making it easier for all my latent incorrect thoughts to be exposed in a concentrated manner, which is convenient for launching ideological struggle. On the other hand, this kind of labor is particularly easy to develop and consolidate my labor viewpoint and other ideological gains, and to exercise my revolutionary will and drive, thereby endowing myself with the combat power to overcome all difficulties and obstacles. In addition, because our labor training is carried out in the common labor and common life of the basic peasant masses, it is most convenient for us to change our lifestyle and ideological feelings, and to establish and strengthen the mass viewpoint, thereby promoting the fundamental change of our worldview and outlook on life from all aspects. Therefore, although I do not agree with the view that labor is the only way to transform intellectuals, I believe that labor creates the most favorable conditions for ideological remolding.

### 究竟应该怎么劳动锻炼？  劳动并不能自发地改造思想

    究竟应该怎么劳动锻炼？
    劳动并不能自发地改造思想
    我是中国科学院的下放干部。去年12月当我刚刚下放到太行山上参加劳动的时候，我也曾错误地认为通过劳动锻炼就能够自然而然地改造自己的思想，以致放松和忽视了在劳动锻炼的过程中，抓紧每一个重要时机和环节，积极开展思想斗争、进行思想改造的自觉。后来，经过一段时间的劳动和领导上指出应该通过劳动锻炼有意识地改造自己的思想以后，思想上、行动上才开始有了明显的转变。现在，我来谈谈我对劳动锻炼和思想改造的关系的体会。
    思想改造是劳动锻炼的动力和保证。劳动锻炼固然为思想改造创造和提供了有利条件，但劳动锻炼本身并不能自发地改造我们的思想。这不只因为任何种类的劳动生产都不会自发地产生出社会主义、共产主义思想，而且，更重要的，是因为存在于我们思想上的资产阶级观点，还不断地从各方面妨碍我们积极、正确地对待劳动锻炼，妨碍在劳动锻炼过程中新的思想观点的成长和发展。例如在听到部分社员关于自己干副业生产每天能挣一元多，而给社里干活每工只开四角多的埋怨后，我曾从提高农民生活水平的片面认识出发，在思想上不自觉地产生了同情心理。再如在劳动锻炼中感到由于学习时间不多，业务荒疏现象显著，而思想提高现象却不显著后，我曾经产生过：下放锻炼不如在机关里边学习、边劳动好的错误思想。经过反复学习文件，特别是自觉地开展了思想斗争，这些思想问题才从根本上得到了解决。在劳动锻炼过程中，类似的思想问题是不断地发生的，并且视自己思想上的自发或自觉状态而定，时起时伏、或明或暗地产生和发展着，只有在我们经常地、全面地保持了社会主义的自觉的情况下，这些思想问题才能经过反复的斗争而趋于消失，我们的思想才能通过劳动锻炼而有所提高，思想改造的收获才能积累和巩固起来，更艰苦的劳动锻炼才能在更高的热情、更大的决心下愉快地长期坚持
  下去。因此，在劳动锻炼中，也如在其他场合一样，必须时刻警惕着来自各方面的旧思想的侵蚀，必须时刻保持着彻底改造思想的社会主义自觉，并且经常地把所有的自觉系统化、巩固起来和长期坚持下去。
    思想改造的方式和道路是多样性的，但是劳动锻炼，特别是长时期地坚持的、艰苦的劳动锻炼，却为思想改造提供最有利的条件和环境。在下放初期，我曾经认为劳动锻炼不是夺锦标、抢工分，干活必须“量力而行”，因而在出勤率和干活的负荷量上处处表现出右倾保守思想，结果，不够艰苦、不够连续的劳动锻炼对自己的思想触动不大，收获也很小。以后在领导上的正确批评和指示下，我开始转变自己的思想认识和劳动锻炼态度，无论在出勤率上和干活的负荷量上，都尽自己在增长着的体力的最大限度，连续地坚持着抗与挺。结果不仅初步突破了重劳动这一关，在出勤率上提前十天完成领导上所规定的指标，在铡草与近距离担土上达到一个整劳动力的生产指标。在劳动态度上，由于坚持雪地担粪、带动社员一齐出工而受到农业社的表扬。而且，更重要的是在思想改造上得到了很大的收获。这首先因为连续地坚持的艰苦劳动，最能触动自己娇生惯养的资产阶级思想，从而易于使自己潜伏着的一切不正确思想集中地暴露出来，便于展开思想斗争。而另方面，这种劳动，又特别易于发展和巩固自己的劳动观点等等思想收获，锻炼出自己的革命意志和干劲，从而赋予自己以战胜一切困难与障碍的战斗力量。另外，由于我们的劳动锻炼是在基本农民群众的共同劳动、共同生活中进行的，因此又最便于我们改变自己的生活作风和思想感情，并建立和加强群众观点。从而从各个方面促进自己的世界观和人生观的根本改变。因此，我虽然不同意劳动是改造知识分子的唯一办法的观点，但是却认为劳动为思想改造创造了最有利的条件。河北赞皇大众农业社社员
