The Shanghai factories and the Beijing Mishidajie Non-staple Food Store actively helped workers solve their living difficulties during the Great Leap Forward, paid more attention to safety work, and reasonably arranged workers' work and rest time, which made the workers even more enthusiastic.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st -- In the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in production, leading cadres of many factories in Shanghai implemented the spirit of rectification, and paid attention to caring for the workers better in terms of work and life.

Recently, many workers, in order to overcome the key points in production, often forgot to eat and sleep when their enthusiasm came, and fought day and night. In order to protect the health of the workers, the leading cadres of the factories often repeatedly persuaded and urged them to pay attention to rest. Gan Weijun, Zhang Boping, and Zhang Defu, three young workers from the repair workshop of Jiangnan Shipyard, worked until 3:00 a.m. to rush to repair a square shed to present as a gift to the National Youth Workers Congress. The Communist Youth League committee of the factory found out about it the next day and advised them to go back to rest early.

Many factories pay more attention to production safety than in the past. Shanghai Paper Industry Company strengthened the guidance of safe production by using methods such as express reports and cadres going to factories. Therefore, although the speed of each paper mill has been greatly increased compared with the past, the number of accidents has been reduced compared with the past. Since the leadership of the Zhonghua Shipyard put forward the slogan of comparing more, faster, better, and more economical, and comparing safety, each working section and group put forward specific measures to eliminate work-related injuries when formulating the leap forward guarantees. In the past, glass factories and thermos bottle factories, which were most threatened by silicosis, have also concentrated their efforts to attack this major problem and actively carried out dust prevention work since the Double-Anti movement. Now many factories have reduced the concentration of silica dust in the air to the national standard, and the silica dust concentration in Xinya Glass Factory is lower than the national standard.

In the process of great rectification and great improvement, the leadership of each factory is very concerned about the problems existing in the lives of the masses. Ji Bizhong, the leader of the carry-the-flag group of the No. 2 State-owned Cotton Mill, recently visited Xia Yonggao's family on Sunday and found that his family's cotton wadding had no quilt cover. He knew that his family had difficulties in life after a fire last year, but Xia Yonggao had never asked for subsidies. He came back and told everyone that after discussion, everyone agreed to subsidize him 30 yuan. The public-owned factory director and the party branch secretary of the Key Instrument Hardware Factory often hold various forums, talk with workers, and visit workers' homes to help everyone solve their difficulties. The workers felt very kind and warm, and their enthusiasm for production became greater and greater. Now the workers in the factory have generally exceeded the quota by about 40%. (Zhou Li)

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Mishidajie Non-staple Food Store in Beijing rationally arranges the workers' work and spare time activities, so that the workers can still have appropriate study and rest time after the store reduces staff and implements the "one shift to the end" working hours, and can work energetically for a long time.

The store's method of rationally arranging work and rest time is:

1.  According to the different business levels of each sales group during the day, the strength of each group can be adjusted to each other. In this way, not only the problem of uneven busy and idle times is solved, but also the salesperson can fully familiarize himself with the business and leap forward to become an "all-around salesperson".
2.  According to the "one shift to the end" working hour system, the work, break and meal shift time of each salesperson is appropriately arranged. Make each salesperson have a bottom line in mind, go to work on time, and leave in time.
3.  When there are no customers buying goods, the salespeople seize the time to do their own work. For example, the non-staple food group packs daylily, fungus, red and white sugar into small packages, and the fruit group picks out the good and bad fruits, etc. In this way, time outside of business can be saved, and business efficiency can be improved, which is convenient for customers.
4.  In the past, the workers came very early in the morning to prepare for business. Now, it only takes a quarter of an hour in advance.
5.  In the past, at the end of each day's business, the salesperson would carry out the work of checking goods and payments, grain coupons, oil coupons, and replenishing shelves. Because they were not grasped tightly enough, it took more than half an hour every day. Now, it can be done in a quarter of an hour. The monthly inventory of goods only takes two hours.
6.  The party, league, and trade union activities are rationally arranged and fixed in time, and it is stipulated that each activity must be fully prepared in advance, and the content of the meeting must be notified to the participants. Generally, the meeting lasts for half an hour, and the longest does not exceed one hour. If one discussion is not finished, continue the discussion next time.
7.  Do a good job in workers' learning. At present, the main way to improve political awareness is through rectification. Current affairs learning is carried out by explaining and selecting newspapers. Business learning is included in trade union activities and does not take up extra time.
8.  Regarding the issue of public holidays, except for five people who voluntarily take a break every two weeks, the rest of the people take a break on a weekly basis.

### 群众干劲越大　越要关心群众

    群众干劲越大　越要关心群众
    上海许多工厂和北京米市大街副食品商店，在大跃进中主动帮助职工解决生活困难，更加注意安全工作，合理安排职工的工作和休息时间，职工的干劲更大了。
    本报上海31日电　在生产大跃进的热潮中，上海许多工厂的领导干部，贯彻整改精神，注意从工作上、生活上更好地关心职工。
    最近，许多工人为了攻下生产上的关键，劲头来的时候，往往废寝忘食，夜以继日地奋战。工厂的领导干部为了保护职工们的身体健康，常常一再劝说，督促他们注意休息。江南造船厂修理车间甘维君、章伯平、张德富三个青年工人，为了赶修一部方棚向全国青年工人代表会议献礼，一直搞到半夜三点钟。厂里团委第二天知道了，就劝他们早些回去休息。
    不少工厂比过去更加重视生产安全工作。上海造纸工业公司用快报、干部下厂等方法，加强了安全生产的指导工作，所以，各造纸厂的车速虽然比过去大大提高，事故却比过去减少。中华造船厂由于领导上提出了比多快好省、比安全的口号，各工段、小组在制订跃进保证的时候，都提出了消灭工伤事故的具体措施。过去受矽肺病威胁最严重的玻璃厂、热水瓶厂，在双反运动以来，也集中力量猛攻这个大问题，积极开展防尘工作。现在许多工厂已经把空气中矽尘浓度降低到国家规定的标准，新亚玻璃厂的矽尘浓度降得比国家标准还低。
    在大整大改中，各厂领导上对群众生活上存在的问题非常关心。国棉二厂扛棒小组组长季必忠最近在星期天访问夏永高的家庭的时候，发现他家里的棉絮没有被面，知道他家去年失火后，生活有困难，但是夏永高从来没有要求过补助。他回来告诉大家，经过讨论，大家同意补助他三十元。科仪五金厂的公方厂长和党支部书记经常召开各种座谈会，和工人谈心，到工人家里去访问，帮助大家解决困难。工人们感到非常亲切和温暖，生产劲头越来越大，现在全厂工人已普遍突破定额40％左右。　（周立）
    据新华社讯　北京市米市大街副食品商店，合理安排职工的工作和业余活动时间，使商店在减少人员、实行“一班顶到底”的工作时间以后，职工们仍能有适当的学习和休息时间，能长期精力充沛地工作。
    这个店合理安排作息时间的办法是：
    一、根据各售货组在一天内营业忙闲不同的情况，各组力量可以互相调配。这样，不仅解决了忙闲不均的问题，还使售货员能全面熟悉业务，向“全能售货员跃进”。
    二、根据“一班顶到底”的工时制度，恰当地安排每个售货员的上下班及吃饭轮替时间。使每个售货员都心中有底，按时上班，及时离开。
    三、在没有顾客买货时，售货员都抓紧做自己手头的工作。如副食组把黄花菜、木耳、红、白糖等包成小包，水果组把水果按好坏挑选出来等。这样，可以节省营业以外的时间，还可以提高营业效率，便利顾客。
    四、过去，每天早晨职工们来得很早，进行营业前的准备工作。现在，只提早一刻钟就行了。
    五、过去每天营业终了，售货员就进行整点货款和粮票、油票、补充货架等工作，由于抓得不够紧，每天都需要半小时以上。现在，一刻钟就可以做完。每月一次的盘点商品，只要两小时也够了。
    六、合理安排和固定了党、团和工会活动时间，并且规定每次活动必须事先充分作好准备，把会议内容通知参加者，一般开会半小时，最长不超过一小时，一次谈不完，下次继续讨论。
    七、搞好职工学习。当前主要是通过整风来提高政治觉悟。时事学习以讲解和选读报纸的方式进行。业务学习包括在工会活动内，不另占用时间。
    八、公休问题，除五个人自愿实行两星期休息一次外，其余的人都按周轮休。
