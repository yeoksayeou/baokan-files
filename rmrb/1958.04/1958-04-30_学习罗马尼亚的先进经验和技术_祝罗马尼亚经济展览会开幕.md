Learning from Romania's Advanced Experience and Technology
—Congratulations on the Opening of the Romanian Economic Exhibition
Ji Chaoding, Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade

The Romanian Economic Exhibition, the first of its kind held in our country by the People's Republic of Romania, has opened. I extend my warm congratulations with great pleasure. This is an exhibition of great significance, which not only symbolizes the profound friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples, but also demonstrates the brilliant achievements of the Romanian people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and the government. I believe that this exhibition will not only promote the friendship and technological exchange between the Chinese and Romanian peoples, but also actively promote the development of trade between the two countries.

China and Romania are both socialist countries based on Marxism-Leninism and share common and beautiful ideals. The political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries are constantly developing and consolidating. The recent visit to China by the government delegation of the People's Republic of Romania headed by Chairman Chivu Stoica is a sign of the further growth of the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples. Chairman Chivu Stoica held talks with Premier Zhou Enlai and issued a joint statement by the governments of China and Romania. This is a major contribution to the solidarity between socialist countries and the cause of world peace. Through this exhibition, the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Romanian peoples will be further enhanced, making the two peoples more closely united and striving to realize our common and beautiful ideals.

In the thirteen years since liberation, the People's Republic of Romania has completely changed its pre-liberation state of economic backwardness and has become a country with advanced industry. Its industrial output value accounts for 60.4% of the total output value. Industrial production has increased more than threefold compared to 1948. Many new industrial sectors have been established, including electrical equipment, inorganic fertilizers, plastics, man-made fibers, and uranium refining. It is particularly worth mentioning that Romania's petroleum industry and machine manufacturing industry have made significant progress. Romania is known for its rich oil production, with crude oil production reaching 11 million tons per year. Romania's agriculture has also developed rapidly. To date, the socialist sector of Romanian agriculture accounts for 52.4% of the total agricultural land area, with 14,000 agricultural production cooperatives. Due to the development of the machine manufacturing industry, tractors, combine harvesters, seeders, and other machinery are widely used in agricultural production. As a result, wheat production in 1957 increased by 340,000 tons compared to 1938, and corn production increased by 2.3 million tons. The harvest of Romanian crops in 1957 reached the highest level in forty years.

At the exhibition, we can see various types of excellent industrial products, agricultural products, and exquisite light industrial textile daily necessities, chemical medicines, optical instruments, etc. produced in Romania. The lathes, milling machines, air compressors, saws, U-245 horsepower tractors, seeders, locomotives for coal mines, machines for the food industry, and highly technical oil drilling equipment exhibited at the exhibition all reflect the high development of Romanian industry and agriculture. They can not only meet the needs of the country's people, but also support the construction of other fraternal countries and be exported to various countries. At present, Romania has traded with seventy countries and signed trade agreements and payment agreements with thirty-six of them. The visit to Beijing by the government delegation headed by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of Romania to attend the opening ceremony of the exhibition once again illustrates the increasingly close economic relations between our two countries.

The Chinese and Romanian peoples have close cooperation in both culture and science and technology. In recent years, various cooperation agreements have been signed successively. These agreements guarantee broad cooperation between China and Romania in various scientific and cultural fields. The People's Republic of Romania has provided us with great assistance in supplying agricultural machinery, power station equipment, petroleum products, and petroleum industrial equipment, and in sending experts to impart experience. The development of China's Karamay Oilfield has received strong support from the Romanian exploration team. I believe that this sincere and selfless cooperation will be more specifically reflected in this exhibition. The exchange of experience between the technical personnel of the two countries will help improve each other's technology. At a time when our country is in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward, all advanced technologies are our role models to learn from. We must learn from our close Romanian brothers their advanced technologies and experiences with the revolutionary spirit of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced. And further strengthen the close unity and cooperation between the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union.

Finally, I wish the Romanian Economic Exhibition the greatest success!

    学习罗马尼亚的先进经验和技术
    ——祝罗马尼亚经济展览会开幕
    中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席兼秘书长　冀朝鼎
    罗马尼亚人民共和国在我国第一次举办的罗马尼亚经济展览会开幕了。我以愉快的心情致以热烈的祝贺。这是一个有着重大意义的展览会，它不仅标志着中罗两国人民的深厚友谊，而且也显示了罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党和政府的领导下，在社会主义建设中所获得的光辉成就。我相信通过这次展览会不但会促进中罗两国人民的友谊及技术交流，而且对中罗两国贸易的发展也有着积极的推动作用。
    中国和罗马尼亚都是以马克思列宁主义为基础的社会主义国家，有着共同的美好理想。两国之间的政治、经济和文化关系正在不断地发展和巩固。不久前以基伏·斯托伊卡主席为首的罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团来中国的访问，是中罗两国人民之间的兄弟友谊进一步增长的标志。基伏·斯托伊卡主席同周恩来总理举行了会谈，并发表了中罗两国政府联合声明。这对社会主义国家之间的团结和世界和平事业是有着重大贡献的。通过这次展览会，将更进一步增进中罗两国人民的相互了解，使两国人民更紧密地团结在一起，为实现我们共同的美好理想而努力。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国在解放以来的十三年多的时间里，已完全改变了解放前的经济落后状态，成为拥有先进工业的国家了。它的工业产值占全部产值的60.4％。工业产量较1948年增加了三倍多。建立了许多新的工业部门包括电气装置、无机肥料、塑料、人造纤维和铀的提炼等。特别值得提出的是罗马尼亚的石油工业和机器制造业有了显著的发展。罗马尼亚以盛产石油著称，原油产量每年达一千一百万吨。罗马尼亚的农业也有着迅速的发展。到目前为止，罗马尼亚农业的社会主义部分已占农业土地总面积的52.4％，已有一万四千个农业生产合作组织。由于机器制造业的发展，在农业生产方面广泛使用了拖拉机、康拜因机、播种机等。因之1957年的小麦产量较1938年增加了三十四万吨，玉米产量增加了二百三十万吨，1957年罗马尼亚农作物的收获量达到四十年来的最高水平。
    在展览会上，我们可以看到罗马尼亚生产的各种类型的优良的工业产品、农产品和精美的轻工纺织日用品、化学药品、光学仪器等。展览会上展出的车床、铣床、空气压缩机、锯床、乌拖斯四十五马力拖拉机、播种机、煤矿用机车、食品工业用机器以及具有高等技术水平的石油钻探设备等，都体现了罗马尼亚工农业的高度发展，不仅可以供给本国人民的需要，还可以支援其他兄弟国家的建设并出口到各个国家去。目前罗马尼亚已同七十个国家进行了贸易，并同其中的三十六个国家签订了贸易协定和支付协定。这次以罗马尼亚人民共和国对外贸易部副部长为首的政府代表团来北京参加展览会的开幕式，再一次说明了我们两国经济关系日益密切的情况。
    中罗两国人民无论在文化方面和科学技术方面，都有着密切的合作。几年来，先后签订了各项合作协定。这些协定保证了中罗两国在科学文化各个方面进行广泛的合作。罗马尼亚人民共和国在供应我国农业机器、电站设备、石油产品和石油工业设备方面，在派遣专家传授经验方面，都给予了我们很大的帮助。我国克拉玛依油田的开发工作就得到了罗马尼亚勘探队的大力支援。我相信，这种真诚无私的合作这一次将更具体地表现在展览会上。通过两国技术人员的交流经验，将有助于相互间技术的提高。正当我国处在生产大跃进的高潮中的今天，一切先进技术都是我们学习的榜样。我们要以学先进、赶先进的革命干劲向我们亲密的罗马尼亚兄弟们学习他们的先进技术和经验。并进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家之间的紧密团结和合作。
    最后，谨祝罗马尼亚经济展览会获得最大的成功！
