    The Victory of the Togolese People
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    On April 27th, the French trust territory of Togo in Southwest Africa held elections for the Legislative Assembly. The results of the election were: the nationalist party demanding complete independence for Togo, the Togolese Unity Committee, won 28 of the 46 seats in the Legislative Assembly, securing a near two-thirds majority; while the ruling party, the “Togolese Progress Party,” which supports French colonial policies, only won five seats and suffered a crushing defeat.
    According to the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly in December 1957, the Legislative Assembly produced by this election will make decisions on the abolition of the trusteeship system and the future of Togo. Therefore, this election became an important struggle between the Togolese people and the French colonialists. Before the election, the French colonialists carried out many conspiracies, trying to turn this election into a means for them to consolidate their colonial rule in Togo. However, the facts completely shattered the colonialists' illusions. Even Western news agencies admitted: "This election completely disrupted France's plan for Togo."
    The victory of the Togolese Unity Committee in the election vividly reflects the national awakening of the Togolese people and their strong desire for independence and freedom. In recent years, with the rise of the African national independence movement, the Togolese people have launched a struggle demanding an end to trusteeship and the realization of complete independence. The French colonialists concocted so-called "autonomy" and other colonialist schemes, attempting to deceive the Togolese people with a "same medicine, different bottle" approach and paralyze and obstruct their struggle, but all failed due to the opposition of the Togolese people. Now, through this election struggle, the Togolese people have once again thwarted France's colonial plan, which marks Togo is moving towards the road of independence and freedom.
    The people of Asia, Africa, and the world are very concerned about the struggle of the Togolese people. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and the Conference of Independent African States expressed their support for the struggle of the Togolese people in their resolutions. Togo, like many other places in Africa, is undergoing historic changes. Although these changes sometimes happen faster and sometimes slower, they are, after all, unstoppable by any force. Of course, there are still stubborn colonialist enemies and various difficulties in the face of the national independence movement in Togo, but the new forces will continue to grow, and the Togolese people's desire for independence and freedom will surely be realized.

    多哥人民的胜利
    本报评论员
    4月27日，法国在西南非洲的托管地多哥举行了立法议会选举。选举结果是：要求多哥完全独立的民族主义政党——多哥统一委员会获得了立法议会四十六个席位中的二十八个席位，取得近三分之二的多数；而支持法国殖民政策的执政党——“多哥进步党”则只获得五席，遭到了惨败。
    根据1957年12月联合国大会的决议，这次选举产生的立法议会，将就废除托管制度以及多哥的前途问题作出决定。因此，这次选举就成为多哥人民同法国殖民者之间的一场重要斗争。在选举以前，法国殖民者曾经进行许多阴谋活动，想把这次选举变为它在多哥巩固殖民统治的手段。可是，事实完全粉碎了殖民者的幻想。连西方通讯社也承认：“这次选举完全打乱了法国的多哥计划。”
    多哥统一委员会在选举中所获得的胜利，生动地反映了多哥人民的民族觉醒和他们要求独立自由的强烈愿望。近几年来，随着非洲民族独立运动的高涨，多哥人民展开了要求结束托管、实现完全独立的斗争。法国殖民者制造了所谓“自治”等等殖民主义计划，想用“换汤不换药”的办法欺骗多哥人民，麻痹和阻挡他们的斗争，但是都由于多哥人民的反对而未能实现。现在，多哥人民通过这次选举斗争，又一次挫败了法国的殖民计划，这标志着多哥正向着独立自由的道路迈进。
    亚非和世界各国人民非常关心多哥人民的斗争。亚非人民团结大会和非洲独立国家会议，都在决议中表示了对多哥人民斗争的支持。多哥，同非洲许多其他的地方一样，正在发生着历史性的变化。尽管这种变化有时快些，有时慢些，但是它毕竟是任何力量都无法阻挡的。在多哥的民族独立运动面前当然还有顽强的殖民主义敌人，还有种种困难，可是新生的力量是会不断成长的，多哥人民要求独立自由的愿望一定会实现。
