Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, 17th: Moroccan Prime Minister Bekkai submitted his resignation to Moroccan King Mohammed V on the 15th. The King accepted his resignation on the 16th and ordered the dissolution of the government.

It is said that Bekkai resigned due to disagreements with ministers from the Independence Party. The Independence Party is the main ruling party in Morocco, holding nine seats out of the fourteen ministers in the government. Prime Minister Bekkai is an independent.

According to the Independence Party's newspaper "Al-Alam", Independence Party ministers wrote to the King, emphasizing the need for an "effective and fully united government" to achieve the following "national tasks": "The withdrawal of foreign troops from Morocco, the liberation of the part of the country still under occupation, consistent support for the Algerian people, the realization of Arab North African unity, and the establishment of a healthy democratic system in political and social aspects."

    摩洛哥国王解散政府
    独立党要求执行民族政策
    新华社17日讯　拉巴特消息：摩洛哥首相贝凯15日向摩洛哥国王穆罕默德五世提出辞职。国王在16日接受了他的辞职，下令解散了政府。
    据说，贝凯之所以辞职，是由于独立党的大臣同他意见分歧。独立党是摩洛哥的主要执政党，它在政府全部十四个大臣中占九席。首相贝凯是无党派人士。
    据独立党机关报“旗帜报”报道，独立党大臣曾经写信给国王，强调指出必须有一个“有效的和完全团结一致的政府”来实现下列“民族任务”：“外国军队撤出摩洛哥，解放仍然在占领下的一部分国土，始终一贯地支持阿尔及利亚人民，实现阿拉伯北非的团结以及在政治方面和社会方面建立健康的民主制度。”
