Xinhua News Agency, April 4th - The State Council held its 74th plenary session this afternoon and passed the directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on large-scale afforestation throughout the country.

    Before the directive was passed, Vice Minister of Forestry Hui Zhongquan briefed the meeting on the current state of afforestation. He said that currently, industry and agriculture across the country are making rapid progress, and the afforestation movement is also advancing at an unprecedented rate. In March alone, the country has afforested 170 million mu, approximately 110% of the total completed during the First Five-Year Plan. Guizhou Province has now afforested 24.72 million mu, an average of 1.5 mu per person. Anhui Province originally planned to afforest just over 4 million mu this year, but has already completed 24.33 million mu, far exceeding the original plan. It is estimated that the total area of barren hills afforested nationwide this year will exceed 300 million mu. To date, 6 billion trees have been planted beside houses, villages, roads, and waterways across the country, exceeding the original plan of 2 billion trees by 4 billion. The enthusiasm and drive of the broad masses for afforestation are high. To solve the problem of water shortage for planting trees in the high mountains, the masses carried snow and ice from the mountains and rivers last winter and buried them in the soil for storage. Where there was no soil on the barren hills for planting trees, the masses carried soil in baskets from the foot of the mountains to the high mountains. Currently, many provinces and cities have set plans to basically complete greening in about five years. This situation shows that the requirements put forward in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) to green all possible barren hills and plant trees beside houses, villages, roads, and waterways within ten years can not only be fully realized but can also be realized ahead of schedule.
    After hearing the explanation of Minister of Agriculture Liao Luyan, the meeting passed the notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on convening a national conference of advanced units in agricultural socialist construction. This meeting will be held in Beijing this winter.
    After hearing the explanation of Vice Minister of the Second Ministry of Commerce Deng Chenxi, the meeting passed the State Council's directive on the utilization and collection of wild plant raw materials in our country. Deng Chenxi said that our country has abundant wild plant raw materials that can be utilized, with no fewer than a thousand important raw materials already discovered. The full utilization of these wild resources is of great significance to the development of light industry, especially to the economic prosperity of mountainous areas.
    The meeting also passed decisions to: abolish Zhumadian City in Henan Province, rename the original Zhumadian City as a town, and place it under the leadership of Queshan County; abolish Zhoukou City in Henan Province, rename the original Zhoukou City as a town, and place it under the leadership of Shangshui County; abolish Tongchuan County in Shaanxi Province, establish Tongchuan City, and use the original administrative region of Tongchuan County as the administrative region of Tongchuan City; abolish Kunyang and Yanxing Counties in Yunnan Province, merge the original administrative region of Kunyang County into Jinning County, and merge the original administrative region of Yanxing County into Guangtong County; abolish Changshu City in Jiangsu Province, rename its original jurisdiction as Yushan Town, and place it under the leadership of Changshu County; abolish Chongxin, Liangdang, Huachi, Zhangxian, Huichuan, and Jingtai Counties in Gansu Province, merge the entire administrative region of the original Chongxin County into Huating County, merge the entire administrative region of the original Liangdang County into Huixian County, merge the entire administrative region of the original Huachi County into Qingyang County, merge the entire administrative region of the original Zhangxian County into Wushan County, and merge twenty-seven townships of the original Huichuan County, except for the Yihuqiao and Dacaotan townships which are transferred to Wushan County, into Weiyuan County, and merge the entire administrative region of the original Jingtai County into Gaolan County.
    Finally, the meeting passed a list of appointments and removals.

    国务院全体会议通过两个指示
    大规模造林充分利用野生植物
    并通过召开全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的通知
    新华社4日讯　国务院在今天下午举行第七十四次全体会议，通过了中共中央和国务院关于在全国大规模造林的指示。
    在通过这个指示以前，林业部副部长惠中权向会议介绍了今年造林的情况。他说，目前全国工农业都在突飞猛进，造林运动也在空前迅速地前进。仅仅今年截至3月底止，全国已经造林一亿七千万亩，约达第一个五年计划期间完成数的110％。贵州省现在已造林二千四百七十二万亩，全省每人平均造林达一亩半。安徽省今年原来只计划造林四百多万亩，而目前已完成了二千四百三十三万亩，远远超过了原计划。预计，今年全国荒山造林总面积将超过三亿亩。到目前为止，全国已在宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁植树六十亿株，比原计划的二十亿株超过了四十亿株。广大人民群众造林的热情高昂，干劲十足。为了解决高山植树缺水的问题，人民群众远在去年冬季就把山上的积雪和河里的冰块，背到山上埋在土里贮藏起来。荒山上植树没有土，人民群众就从很远的山下把土一筐筐背到高山上。目前，不少省市已经定出规划，争取在五年左右基本上完成绿化。这个情况表明，全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所提出的十年绿化一切可能绿化的荒山和在宅旁、村旁、路旁、水旁植树的要求，不但完全可以实现，而且可以提前实现。
    会议在听取了农业部部长廖鲁言的说明后，通过了中共中央和国务院关于召开全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议的通知。这个会议将于今年冬季在北京召开。
    会议在听取了第二商业部副部长邓辰西的说明后，通过了国务院关于利用和收集我国野生植物原料的指示。邓辰西说，我国可资利用的野生植物原料十分丰富，已发现的重要原料不下千种。充分利用这些野生资源，对轻工业的发展，特别是对山区的经济繁荣，有重大的意义。
    会议还分别通过决定：撤销河南省驻马店市，将原驻马店市改设为镇，划归确山县领导，撤销河南省周口市，将原周口市改设为镇，划归商水县领导；撤销陕西省铜川县，设立铜川市，并以原铜川县的行政区域作为铜川市的行政区域；撤销云南省昆阳和盐兴两个县，将原昆阳县的行政区域合并于晋宁县，将原盐兴县的行政区域合并于广通县；撤销江苏省常熟市，将其原辖区改设为虞山镇，划归常熟县领导；撤销甘肃省崇信、两当、华池、漳县、会川、景泰六个县，将原崇信县的行政区域全部并入华亭县，将原两当县的行政区域全部并入徽县，将原华池县的行政区域全部并入庆阳县，将原漳县的行政区域全部并入武山县，将原会川县的行政区域除殪虎桥、大草滩两个乡划归武山县外，其余二十七个乡划归渭源县，将原景泰县的行政区域全部并入皋兰县。
    会议最后通过了任免名单。
