Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th (TASS dispatch): On April 28th, the same day that the Soviet government delegation headed by Mikoyan concluded its visit to West Germany, a communiqué on the signing of an economic and consular relations agreement between the two countries was published simultaneously in the Soviet and West German capitals.

The communiqué stated that the economic and consular relations agreement between the two countries, signed in Bonn on April 25, 1958, was drafted during the recent negotiations between government delegations of the two countries in Moscow. This includes a long-term trade and payment agreement, an agreement on general issues of trade and navigation, a 1958 exchange of goods protocol, and a consular treaty.

The communiqué said that after the signing ceremony, the Soviet delegation paid a four-day visit to West Germany and held talks with West German government leaders. During the talks, both sides once again emphasized that they would do everything possible to ensure the implementation of the treaties and agreements signed, as well as the verbal agreement mentioned in the final communiqué of Moscow on April 8, 1958, regarding the repatriation of citizens of both countries. The two sides also reached an agreement to hold negotiations this year to lay a more solid foundation for cultural and scientific-technical relations between the two countries.

The communiqué said that the talks also touched on some fundamental issues of bilateral relations and the current international situation. Both sides emphasized that the two governments would do everything possible to resolve existing problems based on the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, in a spirit of mutual understanding, and through peaceful means, in order to gradually improve relations between the two countries, thereby contributing to safeguarding lasting peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 28th (TASS dispatch): West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer, in a statement on the visit of Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan to West Germany, expressed hope that Mikoyan's visit would mark the beginning of regular negotiations between the Soviet Union and West Germany on international issues in the future. He said that the visit of this Soviet political figure was beneficial, making both sides' positions clearer. However, he believes that West Germany's engagement in atomic armaments would undoubtedly be a serious obstacle to rational negotiations on easing international tensions.

Ollenhauer also talked about Mikoyan's meeting with representatives of the West German Social Democratic Party. He said that through this meeting, he was reinforced in the impression that the Soviet side genuinely supports contacts that would help normalize relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union. He believes that West Germany should also show greater sincerity in this regard.

    就签订经济和领事关系协定
    莫斯科和波恩同时发表公报
    两国将根据谅解与和平方式改善关系
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科28日讯：在以米高扬为首的苏联政府代表团28日结束在西德访问的同一天，在苏联和西德两国首都发表了两国签订经济和领事关系协定的公报。
    公报说，1958年4月25日在波恩签字的两国经济和领事关系协定是不久前两国政府代表团在莫斯科举行谈判时起草的。这里包括长期换货和支付协定、贸易和航海一般问题的协定、1958年换货议定书以及领事条约。
    公报说，在举行签字仪式以后，苏联代表团在西德进行了四天访问，并且同西德政府领导人举行了会谈。在会谈中，双方再一次强调指出，他们将尽一切力量来保证实现所签订的条约和协定以及同1958年4月8日莫斯科最后公报中所提到的有关遣返两国公民的一些问题的口头协议。双方还达成协议，在今年内举行谈判，以便替两国的文化和科学技术关系奠定更巩固的基础。
    公报说，在会谈中还涉及了两国关系和当前国际局势的一些原则性问题。双方着重指出，两国政府将尽一切力量根据互不干涉内政的原则、本着互相谅解的精神、通过和平方式来解决现存的问题，以便逐步改善两国的关系，从而对保障持久和平作出贡献。
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社柏林28日讯：西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔就苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬的访问西德发表谈话，表示希望米高扬的这次访问成为苏联同西德两国今后就国际问题经常举行谈判的开端。他说，苏联这位政治活动家的访问是有益的，它使双方的立场更加明朗化。但是，他认为，西德从事原子武装无疑就会成为缓和国际紧张局势问题举行合理谈判的严重障碍。
    奥伦豪尔还谈到米高扬同西德社会民主党代表的会谈。他说，通过这次会谈，使他加强了这样一种印象，就是苏联方面善意地支持有助于西德同苏联关系正常化的接触。他认为，西德方面也应该在这方面表现更大的诚意。
