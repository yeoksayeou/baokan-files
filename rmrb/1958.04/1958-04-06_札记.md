    Notes
    Absurd "Reasons"
    U.S. Pacific Forces Commander Stump recently declared solemnly in Congress that the United States must not return Okinawa to Japan. He said: "We have only one reason for maintaining Okinawa, and that is for our own defense. We have spent $500 million building facilities there, and we have $500 million worth of equipment there. We have a $1 billion investment there."
    In Stump's view, the United States seems to have at least two ways to acquire land from other countries: first, wherever the United States needs for its "defense," then that place should be "maintained" by the United States; second, wherever the United States has spent money, then that place should belong to the United States. Stump's thinking is wonderful: anyway, the United States can extend its "defense line" to any place in the world, anyway, the United States can spend money everywhere, so, under the whole world, there is no land that is not American soil....
    However, on this earth of ours, besides a small group of insane American imperialists, there are still more than two billion people living, and they believe that national sovereignty is sacred and inviolable. No matter how many "reasons" Stump and his ilk have, the aggressors will eventually suffer.
    Double-Dealing
    In order to belittle the great significance of the Soviet Union's cessation of nuclear weapons testing, the American ruling group and its propaganda machine have two arguments:
    One is: According to reliable information, the Soviet Union has recently conducted more than ten consecutive nuclear tests, so announcing a cessation of testing now is meaningless, and the United States cannot follow suit.
    The other is: The Soviet Union's announcement of a cessation of nuclear testing is not credible because conducting secret tests is possible.
    According to the first argument, the United States "examines" every nuclear test by the Soviet Union clearly; according to the second argument, the United States is "unable to examine" whether the Soviet Union is conducting nuclear tests. "Using your own spear to attack your own shield," shows that the American lying experts have reached the end of their rope. Truly despicable and ridiculous.
    An Unclean Person
    NATO Commander Norstad is not very impressed with the Soviet Union's peaceful proposal to stop nuclear testing. He advocates that Western countries should continue to conduct nuclear tests in order to make nuclear weapons "clean." It seems that this general is quite humane.
    However, people want to ask: If everyone does not conduct nuclear tests and does not use nuclear weapons, as the Soviet Union advocates, wouldn't it be truly and thoroughly "clean"? But Norstad does not agree! Obviously, this American general, who is covered in the stench of money, has a conscience that is already covered in green rust and is inherently unclean.

    札记
    荒诞的“理由”
    美国太平洋部队总司令斯图普最近在国会上信誓旦旦地表示，美国决不能把冲绳交还给日本。他说：“我们保持冲绳的理由只有一个，那就是为了我们自己的防务。我们在那里建造设施方面花了五亿美元，我们在那里有五亿美元的装备。我们在那里有十亿美元的投资。”
    在斯图普看来，美国似乎至少有两种取得别国土地的办法：第一，只要什么地方是美国“防务”所需要的，那么，那个地方就应该由美国“保持”；第二，只要美国在什么地方花了钱，那么那个地方就应该属于美国。斯图普想的倒是很美妙：反正美国可以把“国防线”延长到世界上任何地方，反正美国可以到处花钱，于是，普天之下，就莫非美国之土……。
    但是，在我们这个地球上，除了一小撮丧心病狂的美国帝国主义者以外，毕竟还住着二十几亿人民，他们却认为，民族主权是神圣不可侵犯的。不管斯图普之流有多少“理由”，侵略者终归要倒霉。
    嘴上两张皮
    为了想贬低苏联停止核武器试验的巨大意义，美国统治集团和它的宣传机器有这样两种说法：
    一种是：根据可靠的材料，苏联最近曾连续进行了十多次核试验，所以现在宣布停止试验是没有意义的，美国不能照办。
    另一种是：苏联宣布停止核试验是不可信的，因为进行秘密试验是可能的。
    根据第一种说法，美国对于苏联每一次核试验都是“考查”得清清楚楚的；根据第二种说法，美国是“无法考查”苏联是否进行核试验的。“以子之矛，攻子之盾”，足见美国撒谎专家们已到了黔驴技穷的地步了。实在可鄙而又可笑。
    不干净的人
    北大西洋公约组织司令诺斯塔德对苏联停止核试验的和平建议颇不以为然。他主张西方国家还是要继续进行核试验，为的是使核武器“变干净”。看来，这位将军似乎是颇以人道为重的。
    可是，人们要问：如果大家都不进行核试验，都不使用核武器，像苏联所主张的那样，岂不是真正彻底“变干净”了吗？但是诺斯塔德却不赞成！显然，这位满身铜臭的美国将军的良心早已沾满了绿锈，本来就是很不干净的东西。
