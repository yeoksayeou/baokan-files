Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 21st: Muqi Township, Xinbin County, Liaoning Province, built a water turbine power station in three days that was inexpensive and effective.

	On the night of April 13th, it was pitch black at the Longtougou Reservoir construction site in this township, and rain and snow were falling. From a shed upstream of the reservoir, a buzzing sound of machinery began. Suddenly, over a hundred electric lights turned on simultaneously. The eight hundred plus people preparing to work under the lights cheered. They picked up shovels and pickaxes, started up the earth-moving vehicles and aerial cranes, and worked even harder than they had on previous days. Yuan Baogui, a sixty-seven-year-old farmer, excitedly said, "I originally thought that someone my age might not see electricity in the village, but I didn't expect that in three days, for less than 500 yuan, the power station would be built!"

	The equipment of the water turbine power station is simple. The main power equipment is a wheel-type water turbine composed of a row of rectangular wooden troughs. The water power pushes the wooden wheel of the water turbine, which then drives the generator connected to one end of the main shaft of the water turbine to generate electricity. The other end of the main shaft is equipped with a belt wheel, which can drive machines for pumping water and grinding rice. This was researched and manufactured by cadres sent down here from the Fushun Electric Porcelain Factory, Xinbin Pyrite Mine, and other units, together with local carpenters, based on the principle of water turbine pumps created by Liu Wenyun and others, farmers of Xinbin County. The wooden power-generating water turbine is very functional. Under the conditions of a 1.3-meter drop and 0.08 flow rate of water source, it can generate 8 horsepower of kinetic energy. If the size of the water turbine is increased according to the drop and flow rate, it can also drive a generator of 30 kilowatts or more.

### 辽宁新宾县木奇乡  五百元建成一座发电站

    辽宁新宾县木奇乡
    五百元建成一座发电站
    据新华社沈阳21日电　辽宁省新宾县木奇乡三天建成了一座花钱少效果好的水车发电站。
    4月13日夜里，这个乡的龙头沟水库工地上黑得伸手不见五指，天空飘着雨雪。水库上游一座草棚里刚刚发出嗡嗡的机器转动声，百多只电灯忽然齐明。准备在电灯下施工的八百多人个个欢呼起来，他们操起铁锹洋镐，开动运土车和空中吊车，比以往那一天都干得起劲。六十七岁的老农袁宝贵兴奋地说：“原先寻思我这样年纪也许看不上村子里用电了，没想到三天的功夫，花了不到五百元，就把电站建成了。
    水车发电站的设备简单，主要动力设备是由一排长方形木槽组成的轮式水车，水力冲动水车的木轮，然后带动联接在水轮主轴一端的发电机发电；主轴另一端装上轮带，可以带动机器扬水、磨米。这是抚顺电瓷厂、新宾硫化铁矿等单位下放到这里的干部同当地的木工，根据新宾县农民刘文云等创造水轮抽水机的原理研究制成的。木制发电水车的功能很大，在一点三公尺落差和零点零八流量的水源条件下，就能发出八马力的动能。如果根据落差和流量加大水车的尺寸，还可以带动三十瓩以上的发电机。
