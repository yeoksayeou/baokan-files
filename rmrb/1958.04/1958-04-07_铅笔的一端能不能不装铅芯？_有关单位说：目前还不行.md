    Can one end of a pencil not be fitted with a lead core?
    Relevant units say: Not possible yet
    Our newspaper has continuously received letters from readers suggesting leaving a considerable length at one end of the pencil without a lead core, in order to save lead strips. After studying this suggestion with relevant production units, we believe that the cutters in the "grooving machine" currently used in the pencil industry roll continuously and cannot automatically rise and fall. If we were to manufacture pencils with one end without a lead core, we would have to modify the machine equipment, which would require a period of research and could not be done in the short term. Moreover, the lead core only accounts for one-tenth to one-fifteenth of the cost of the pencil. If the hollow part is filled with other materials, it would add a procedure to the operating process and consume more man-hours, and the savings would not be significant. Therefore, it is currently not possible to manufacture this type of pencil.

    铅笔的一端能不能不装铅芯？
    有关单位说：目前还不行
    本报不断收到读者来信，建议把铅笔的一端留相当长度不装铅芯，以便节约铅条。这个建议，经我们与有关生产单位研究后，认为目前铅笔业所使用的笔杆“刨糟机”中的刀具是连续滚动，不能自动起落，如果制造一端不装铅芯的铅笔，必须改装机器设备，需要一段研究时间，非短时期能够办到。而且铅芯仅占铅笔成本的十分之一至十五分之一，若空芯部分利用其它物质填实，在操作工序上增加一道手续，且多耗费工时，节约价值不大，所以目前还不能制造这种铅笔。
