Refuting the "Two Motivations, Same Effect" Theory
Xin Chu

    In the scientific community's special debate on "Red and Expert," a seemingly plausible argument emerged: "Two motivations can produce the same effect." These proponents argued that the motivation to pursue personal fame and fortune, like the motivation to serve the people, is a driving force for revolutionary work and can achieve the same positive results as serving the people – benefiting socialist construction and the masses. They said: Weren't some famous veteran scientists conducting research for personal fame and fortune before liberation? Aren't they now making the same contributions to the country and the people? How much respect do the Party and the government have for them! They say, don't worry about whether I have the motivation to pursue personal fame and fortune, as long as I produce work achievements. According to these people, our repeated criticism of individualism and the pursuit of fame and fortune is superfluous.

    This argument sounds reasonable at first, but the Two Antis Campaign revealed a list of ways in which individualistic pursuit of fame and fortune harms the interests of the people. For the sake of personal fame and fortune, some scientific workers disobey the state's scientific plans and engage in their own "black projects," indulging in topics that are said to bring world fame, while unwilling to engage in topics that serve socialist construction. They label problems that urgently need to be solved in production practice as "service work" and regard them as an extra burden. They emphasize that what they are engaged in is exploratory research that cannot directly serve production. In fact, any scientific research work, including exploratory research, should first clarify the purpose of its research, which must be to serve production. If it does not serve the socialist collective, deviates from the needs of production, and is not carried out according to plan, then the development of production and science itself will undoubtedly be hindered. Scientific workers who start from personal goals dislike cooperation and love to work alone, even suppressing, excluding, and attacking the work of their colleagues, monopolizing and dominating academically, hindering the development of their discipline. They keep materials, insights, and good topics that they have discovered but cannot do well to themselves, wanting to monopolize them. For the convenience of their own research, they are unwilling to lend equipment. A small number of bourgeois individualists in one research institute called the work of serving all research areas of the institute "shoe-shining." In order to publish papers and become famous quickly, they knowingly publish data with errors without carefully correcting them first. Fearing that surpassing their teachers would damage the prestige of their mentors, some even suppress and prevent their students' scientific papers from being published. Some people only use their students to serve their own research topics, but are unwilling to fully and systematically impart the knowledge that their students need to know. Some medical workers even go so far as to heartlessly watch patients suffer unnecessary pain and even harm their health in order to conduct their own scientific research and collect scientific research materials, conducting "experiments" on patients. Some scientists, because of their academic achievements, have gained lofty reputations, status, and generous material benefits, and feel that doing arduous scientific research is no longer the best shortcut to obtain personal fame and fortune; so they are enthusiastic about "red and white events" (celebrations and funerals), and no longer delve into their own field of knowledge, and do not engage in research work for a long time. Individual authoritative scientists are on the decline academically.

    Some people only see that someone has made some achievements under the control of individualistic fame and fortune thinking, but they do not see the damage that his approach brings to the entire cause, to his colleagues, and to others. They only see that some people have made achievements in their work with the motivation of personal fame and fortune, but they do not see that if these people had less individualistic fame and fortune thinking, they would do their work better, faster, and more economically. Bourgeois individualists may think that the loss is someone else's, and the fame and fortune are mine. In fact, an attitude of harming others to benefit oneself in academic work will no longer lead to fame and fortune in today's socialist society. In the era of individual work competing with individual work, the more one can harm others and benefit oneself, the faster one climbs. But when individual work is compared with collective work, collective members with socialist consciousness, with the support of the Party and the government, and with the help of the masses, and with the collective wisdom of comrades, their research work will inevitably develop vigorously and rapidly. And individual workers, rejecting the help of others, find that their research work is cold, desolate, miserable, and slow to progress. Bourgeois individualistic thought has come to an end in socialist society. Only by resolving to change one's position and thoroughly transform one's thinking will there be a bright future.

    Thinking that the motivation of individualistic fame and fortune can also contribute to the revolutionary cause is a very dangerous idea. It will consciously or unconsciously damage collective interests at any time, and personal fame and fortune are not guaranteed. Only those who sincerely work for socialist construction and for the masses of the people can make real contributions to the revolution and to the people, and can also obtain the due and legitimate reputation and treatment. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "The proletarian communist progressive spirit is completely different from the individualistic progressive spirit. The former pursues truth, supports truth, and struggles most effectively for truth. It has unlimited development prospects and progressiveness; while the latter, even for the individual, its progressiveness is very limited and has no future. Because the latter often consciously obliterates, conceals, and distorts the truth for personal gain." This is worth our serious consideration.

    驳“两种动力一样效果论”
    新初
    在科学界关于“红与专”的专题辩论中，曾出现了一种容易叫人上当的论调：“两种动力可以产生一样的效果”。这些立论者说：追求个人名利的动机同为人民服务的动机一样，是革命工作的动力，可以同为人民服务的动力一样达到良好的效果——有利于社会主义建设、有利于人民大众。他们说：有些著名老科学家在解放前难道不是为着个人名利做研究的吗？他们现在对国家对人民岂不是同样有贡献？党和政府多么尊重他们！他们说，别管我有没有追求个人名利的动机，只要我拿出工作成就来就行。照这种人说来，我们一再批判个人主义名利思想是多余的事了。
    这种论调乍听起来似有道理，但是，双反运动所揭露的，正是个人主义名利思想损害人民利益的一张清单。为了个人名利，有些科学工作者不服从国家科学计划，搞自己的“黑题目”，醉心于那些据说是可以世界闻名的题目，而不愿搞为社会主义建设服务的题目。他们把那些生产实践中迫切需要解决的问题，定名为“服务性工作”，看成是一种额外负担。他们强调他们所搞的是探索性的研究，不能直接服务于生产。其实，任何科学研究工作，包括探索性的研究在内，首先应当明确自己研究的目的，这目的必须是为生产服务。如果不服务于社会主义这个集体，脱离生产需要，不按计划进行研究，那末生产和科学本身的发展无疑地是要受到阻碍的。从个人目的出发的科学工作者，不喜欢合作而爱好单干，甚至压制、排斥、打击同行的工作，在学术上垄断称霸，妨碍了本门学科的发展。他们把资料、心得和自己发现的而又做不了的好题目向同行保密，要独自霸占。为了自己研究方便，器材也不肯借用。有一个研究所里的少数资产阶级个人主义者，把为全研究所各个研究方面服务的工作叫作“擦皮鞋”的工作。为了急于发表论文出名，明知数据有错误，也不肯细心纠正了再发表。害怕徒高于师有损导师威信，竟有把徒弟的科学论文压着不让发表的。也有人只顾使用徒弟来为自己的研究题目服务，却不肯无保留地把徒弟需要知道的知识全面系统地拿出来。有个别医学工作者竟至于为了进行自己的科学研究以及搜集科学研究的材料，忍心眼看着病人遭受不必要的痛苦以至损害健康，在病人身上作“试验”。有些科学家由于学术上的成就获得了崇高的名誉地位和优厚的物质待遇，便感觉到做艰苦的科学研究已经不再是求得个人名利的最好捷径了；于是他们热中于“红白喜事”，而不再钻研他的本门学问，长期不作研究工作。个别权威科学家正在走学术上的下坡路。
    有些人只看到某人在个人主义名利思想支配下作出了一些成就，却没有看到他的作法对整个事业、对同行、对别人带来的损害。他们只看到有的人带着个人名利的动机而在工作上也作出了成绩，却没有看到这些人假如少些个人名利思想就会把工作做得更加多快好省。资产阶级个人主义者也许会想，损失是别人的，名利是我的。其实，以损人利己的态度来作学问，在今天的社会主义社会是不再会成名得利了。在单干和单干比的时代，越能损人利己就越爬得快，但是在单干和集体比的时候，有社会主义觉悟的集体主义者，上有党和政府的支持，下有群众的帮助，同志之间又发挥了集体智慧，他们的研究工作势必轰轰烈烈一日千里。而单干户呢，拒绝别人的帮助，他的研究工作是冷冷清清凄凄惨惨迟迟不进的。资产阶级个人主义思想在社会主义社会是山穷水尽了，只有决心改变立场，彻底改造思想，才会有柳暗花明又一村的好景。
    以为个人主义名利思想的动力同样可以对革命事业作出贡献，是很危险的想法，它随时随地都会自觉地或不自觉地损害集体利益，个人的名利也并无保证。只有诚心诚意为着社会主义建设、为着人民大众的人，才能对革命、对人民作出真正的贡献，也才能得到应得的、正当的名誉和待遇。刘少奇同志说：“无产阶级的共产主义的前进心，与个人主义的前进心，是完全不同的。前者追求真理，拥护真理，并最有效地为真理而斗争，它有无限的发展前途和进步性；而后者即对个人来说，它的进步性也极有限度，并且是没有前途的。因为后者常为个人利益而自觉地抹煞、掩蔽与歪曲真理。”这是值得我们认真体会的。
