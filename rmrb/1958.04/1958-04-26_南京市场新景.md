    New Scene in Nanjing Market

    The Nanjing market, which has a myriad of connections with the economic lives of over a million people, has taken on a new look after the anti-conservatism and anti-waste movement.

      Eliminating Bad Practices

    On a spring morning, the ground in the city's largest Xin街口菜 market is very dry. Neatly arranged vegetable stalls are filled with various vegetables, and not a single drop of water is on the vegetable leaves. Housewives are smiling and saying to each other: We won't be eating water-soaked vegetables anymore!

    This菜 market has basically achieved fresh vegetables without sprinkled water, water ducks turned into dry ducks, gluten not soaked in water, and pickled vegetables not dripping with brine, eliminating bad practices such as oversized, fatty chickens. Following the Xin街口菜 market's elimination of bad practices, more than sixty菜 markets throughout the city are also starting to reform.

    Sit Down and Eat

    In restaurants, there is no longer a phenomenon of queuing to buy meal tickets and eating late after arriving early. Da San Yuan Restaurant has set up a fast-food section, where customers can eat dim sum in one minute, a quick meal in two minutes, and a quick dish in three minutes. Qingheyuan Cooperative Canteen has added more than two hundred kinds of quick dishes, reducing the time for customers to eat from fifteen minutes to about three minutes. Many restaurants have restored the business of ordering dishes by phone.

        Five Sells and One Delivery

    There are more and more mobile grain-selling vehicles. Recently, one morning, the mobile grain-selling vehicle of the Shengzhou Road Grain Supply Station stopped at the entrance of Xujia Lane. Women carrying bamboo baskets and holding sacks came to buy grain. Hua Shuhua, a mother of six children, was the first to buy rice. She said with emotion: "The rectification campaign is great! Grain is delivered to the door, and there is no need to ask the children to queue up to buy it anymore!"

    During the large-scale rectification and reform, more than two hundred grain supply stations in the city have changed the past "five no-sells" to "five sells": selling early in the morning, selling late at night, selling during meals, selling on Sundays, and even selling in the middle of the night. They also implemented "one delivery," delivering oil and grain to the elderly, the weak, the sick, the disabled, and families with many children. They are making every effort to improve supply methods and eliminate the phenomenon of queuing to buy grain. The masses praised: The comrades of the grain station are energetic, the grain selling work is making a great leap forward, they don't care about day or night, they supply as long as you have money and a certificate.

          Truly Retail

    Now, customers entering the Xin街口商店 of the state-owned 百货 Retail Company can buy a single piece of candy, a button, or a pencil lead if they want to. There are more than one thousand two hundred kinds of goods sold in this way. The counters have been changed from the past "one-line" to "open-style," and customers can freely enter the counters to select goods. The store saves goods for customers, and goods that are not dirty or damaged can be returned even after they are taken out of the store.

    南京市场新景
    和一百多万人民经济生活有着千丝万缕联系的南京市市场，经过反保守反浪费运动，气象一新。
      革除陋规
    春天的早晨，全市最大的新街口菜市场的地面上很干燥，顺序排列的菜摊子摆满各种蔬菜，菜叶上没有一滴水珠，家庭主妇们笑盈盈地相互在说：今后不再吃水泡菜了！
    这个菜市场基本上做到鲜菜不洒水、水鸭变干鸭、面筋不泡水、雪菜不拖滷，去除大膆子鸡等陋规。各种菜蔬等级分明、按质论价。继新街口菜市场革除陋规之后，全市六十多个菜市场也正在着手改革。坐下就吃
    在饮食店里，已经没有排队买筹子和来早吃迟的现象了。大三元饭馆新设一个快点部，顾客在一分钟内就能吃到点心，两分钟内吃到快饭，三分钟吃到快菜。庆和园合作食堂增加了两百多种快菜，把顾客吃到饭菜的时间由十五分钟减少到三分钟左右。很多饭馆恢复了电话叫菜的业务。
        五卖一送
    流动售粮车越来越多了。最近一个上午，升州路粮食供应站的流动售粮车在许家巷口停下，妇女们拎着淘箩、拿着口袋来买粮。六个孩子的妈妈花淑华第一个买米，她感动地说：“整风太好了！粮食送到门口，不要再叫孩子去排队买啦！”
    全市两百多个粮食供应站在大整大改中，把过去的五不卖变为五卖：起早卖、带晚卖、吃饭卖、星期日卖、半夜也卖。他们还实行了一送，对老弱病残和多子女者送油粮上门。千方百计地改进供应方法，消灭排队买粮的现象。群众表扬说：粮站同志有干劲，售粮工作大跃进，不问白天和黑夜，有钱有证就供应。
          真正零售
    现在走进国营百货零售公司新街口商店的顾客，想买一粒糖、一颗钮扣、一根铅笔芯、都可买到。像这种折零出售的商品共有一千两百多种。柜台由过去的“一字形”改为“敞开式”，顾客可自由进入柜台挑选商品。商店代顾客保存商品，出门的商品只要不脏不坏也可退换。　（周哲生）（附图片）
