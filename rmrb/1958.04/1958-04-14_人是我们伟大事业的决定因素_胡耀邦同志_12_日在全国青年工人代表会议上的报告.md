Comrades:

Our conference is about to conclude victoriously. At the meeting, some comrades reported on how young workers in their areas have accepted socialist education since the rectification movement, improved their ideological awareness, and thus made new contributions to the motherland. Some comrades talked about how they diligently devoted all their efforts to our common cause, overcoming numerous difficulties and making excellent achievements for the motherland. Some comrades talked about how they used their brains and tried every possible way to find shortcuts, thus creating much wealth for the motherland. Some comrades talked about how they worked hard and persistently experimented, thus making valuable creations and inventions in technology. In addition, several veteran workers spoke about how they used the great qualities of the Chinese working class to care for and help young workers grow rapidly politically and technically. There is no doubt that these are the most practical and vivid teaching materials. We believe that the vast number of young comrades will draw strength from you to move forward. The people of the whole country and Chairman Mao will also be very happy to see your deeds.

Our Cause Is Full of Hope

Our country is in the midst of another socialist upsurge. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country are going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. We are all thrilled by the motherland's vigorous advance. What simple language can be used to describe our country's current situation and its future? In a word, it is full of hope.

People's attitudes toward things and their methods of observing things are inconsistent. Therefore, there are basically three different attitudes and three different views on our country's situation and future. One is full of hope, one is somewhat hopeful, and one is hopeless.

Some people see our cause as a complete darkness, saying that nothing works; agriculture has no hope, and industry has no hope; the Party has no hope, and engaging in socialism has no hope. They oppose the Party and oppose socialism. These are bourgeois right-wingers. Now, some of them have begun to awaken, which is of course welcome. But some still adhere to their views and are prepared to take their reactionary views to the coffin. In Chinese history, the enemies of the people have always regarded our cause as hopeless, but as a result, those who are hopeless are precisely themselves. Therefore, all stubborn rightists can also be called the hopeless faction.

There is another type of person. They are comrades in our revolutionary ranks. They believe that our cause is hopeful, but they lack confidence and enthusiasm. They think that things that people believe can be done quickly can only be done slowly; things that people believe can be done thoroughly, they believe that they can be satisfied after doing half of them; and even things that people believe can be done, they believe cannot be done. People who hold this view easily become conservatives in the revolutionary cause. Conservatives can also be called the somewhat hopeful faction.

We are promoters of the revolutionary cause. In our view, everything before us is full of hope.

Why is our cause full of hope?

Our country has a vast territory of 9.6 million square kilometers. Our country is located in the most climatically favorable zone on Earth. Our country has all kinds of abundant resources. There are few countries in the world that have such favorable natural conditions for carrying out socialist construction as we do.

However, this is not the decisive thing. What is decisive is, first of all, that we have the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. Our Party has the ability to lead our people to win liberation, which has been proven by history. Our Party also has the ability to lead our people to prosperity and strength, which is being believed by more and more people. Why do people increasingly believe in our Party's leadership? This is because our Party put forward a clear and definite line for building socialism several years ago, and has been constantly stipulating and constantly improving various policies for realizing this line. The practice of the past few years, especially the practice of the two socialist upsurges, has powerfully proved that the Party's line and these policies are completely correct. The Party's line and policies are the lighthouse guiding us forward and the fundamental guarantee of our great cause. Our enemies, including the rightists, are most afraid of the Party's line and policies that guide our people from victory to victory. Therefore, they concentrate their efforts on attacking the Party's line and policies, and attacking those good cadres who resolutely implement the Party's line and policies. Now, our enemies have miscalculated, and the rightists have also been defeated. For us young comrades, we have gained knowledge and learned a lesson, making us understand what it means to love the Party. The most important thing about loving the Party is to firmly believe in the Party's line and policies, and resolutely fight for the Party's line and policies. As long as we resolutely act in accordance with the Party's line and policies, we can victoriously advance towards our great goals.

What is decisive is also that our country has a population that accounts for a quarter of the world's population and that has already won liberation.

There are pessimists who say, "It's terrible, there are too many people in our country." It seems that having a large population has become a disaster. How should we view this issue? We Marxists believe that it is necessary to advocate planned parenthood for the health of our nation and to better nurture the next generation. However, it is not a bad thing that our country has a large population, but a good thing. A large population means great strength, which is a very common truth. Our friends are emboldened by our large population. Our enemies dare not bully us casually because we have a large population. In our construction cause, people are the most important productive force; people are the most valuable wealth; people are the decisive factor in our great cause.

Six hundred million people are a great force. This is not only in terms of quantity, but more importantly, the people of our country are people who have broken free from their chains, people who have awakened, people who have been organized, in a word, people who have already taken control of their own destiny. In the old society, when the people were still oppressed and enslaved, their labor was for the benefit of a small number of exploiters. Therefore, their labor enthusiasm and creativity were suppressed. Now it is completely different. The people's labor is for society and for themselves. "Everyone for me, and I for everyone" is a slogan that reflects this new type of relationship and expresses the firm will of the people united to consciously create history. The power released from the hearts of 600 million people is like the fission of an atomic nucleus, hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of times greater than at any time in history. This power can create miracles that our enemies could never have dreamed of. The facts since the Great Leap Forward fully prove this point.

Our 500 million farmers are rapidly changing the face of the countryside with the posture of ten thousand horses galloping. In the past four months, the irrigated area of farmland built by farmers across the country has reached 270 million mu. This is more than 30 million mu more than the 240 million mu built by our ancestors over thousands of years. During the same period, farmers across the country have accumulated more than 140 billion dan of fertilizer, an average of 85 dan of fertilizer per mu, and many cultivated lands are covered with two or three inches of thick fertilizer. Farmers are singing songs like this: "Don't care about the cart, don't care about the pile, apply fertilizer according to inches," "Red soil slope, yellow soil slope, all become black slopes." With water and fertilizer, we can fully predict that as long as there are no major natural disasters, our country will achieve a great harvest this year that has never been seen in history. In the past four months, the speed of afforestation in our country has also been unprecedented. The afforestation area across the country has reached more than 220 million mu, exceeding the total afforestation area in the eight years since liberation. If we continue to work at this speed, we can make most areas of our country "green mountains everywhere, clear water everywhere" in just five years. While the production is leaping forward, cultural learning in rural areas is also in full swing. The speed of eliminating illiteracy has greatly accelerated. Some young people in some counties are very enthusiastic, and they propose: "Borrow a little sleeping time, study hard for three hundred days, ten characters a day, three thousand characters in ten months, digest fifteen hundred, and become an illiteracy-free county." It now appears that illiteracy among young people across the country can be basically eliminated in about three years. In the unprecedentedly fierce sweeping of the four pests, the people of the whole country, especially the vast number of young people, have shown an unparalleled tenacious fighting will. They propose to "leave sparrows with no way to go to heaven, let rats have no way to enter the ground, and let flies and mosquitoes be wiped out and never be reborn." In short, our country's countryside is undergoing another great change that is turning the world upside down. Our country's socialist agriculture is full of hope.

Our seven million young students are enthusiastically responding to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, carrying out work-study programs, actively participating in labor training, and advancing along the road of being both red and expert. They are students in school today, and tomorrow they will be fighters on the labor front of our country's industry and agriculture, and the main force of our country's scientific and technological teams. They are determined to cultivate their love for the working people and their ideas of serving the people, to master the necessary knowledge and skills to build the motherland, and to save money for the country and train their ability to live independently by studying while working and learning while practicing before participating in the construction of the motherland. Therefore, our young students are also full of hope.

Historical Tasks of the Younger Generation

Our country's industry is soaring. In order to build socialist industry in a faster, better, and more economical way, our Party is currently taking several important measures. These are: deeply carrying out the movement against waste and conservatism, rapidly developing local industry, and extensively carrying out technological revolution.

The movement against waste and conservatism, on the basis of the nationwide rectification movement, has further overcome various bad habits left over from the old society, raised the spirit of communism, unleashed endless potential, and broken down various unreasonable regulations and systems that restrict the development of productive forces, which has further stimulated the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers. The money originally needed to build a large-scale iron and steel enterprise can now be used to build two. Many factories that originally took two years to build now only take one year. Local industry is developing forward on a huge scale and at a rapid pace. Our country is a large country, and the resources and manpower of one province are equivalent to a country in Europe. Our local industry has extremely broad prospects. In the future, our country will take large-scale industry as the backbone and small and medium-sized industry as the foundation, combining the development of large-scale industry with the development of small and medium-sized industry. That is to say, the central government, provinces, special districts, counties, townships, and communities all have their own industries. The situation of our country's industry will be like stars all over the sky and flowers blooming all over the land. In order to enable production to continue to leap forward, we must have advanced technical measures. Therefore, we must have a technological revolution. Chairman Mao taught us that we must master all the world's advanced production technologies, and we must also have originality. What others have, we must have; what others don't have, we must also have. We must build our country into the world's first-class industrial power with modern equipment and modern technology in the shortest possible time.

Our country's industry has already presented a very magnificent vision. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the total output value of our country's industry this year will increase by 33% compared with last year. This speed is twice as fast as the average speed of industrial development during the First Five-Year Plan period. The total output value of local industry in many provinces will exceed the total output value of local agriculture in five to seven years. If we develop at this speed, our country will definitely be able to catch up with Britain in steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years, and even leave Britain behind.

Our country's industry is developing so rapidly, but there are very few old backbones of our country's working class, and the technical force is very weak. This has brought extremely glorious and extremely arduous historical tasks to the young generation of our country's working class. Then, what is the situation of our country's young workers? There are now ten million young workers in our country, which is nearly half of the total number of workers in the country. These young workers of ours are full of vigor and eagerly yearn for the future of the motherland and enthusiastically pursue various new things. None of us should underestimate ourselves. However, most of our young workers are students who have just left school and farmers who have just laid down their hoes. Whether in terms of ideology or technology, they are very immature and are not compatible with the great responsibilities borne by the working class. The influence of bourgeois ideology will exist for a long time and will use our immature weaknesses to influence us. Therefore, every young person should not ignore their own weaknesses. Chairman Mao taught us that only by correctly understanding ourselves can we better transform ourselves, and only by transforming our subjective world can we better transform the objective world.

It is precisely from this practical situation of young workers that our Party has, in the nationwide rectification movement, especially called on our young workers to further accept socialist education and consciously transform their thoughts and positions. In the past six months, thanks to the patient teaching of Party organizations at all levels, the help of trade union and Communist Youth League organizations at all levels, and the kind concern of veteran workers, the ideological outlook of the vast number of young workers has undergone profound changes. There are more and more advanced producers among young people. The role of youth shock brigades and youth advanced teams has become more significant. Many comrades who were originally backward have caught up. The advanced are becoming more advanced. A surging tide of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced has formed among young people. That is to say, the great rectification movement has begun to blossom and bear fruit in the minds of our young workers. We are now stronger and have taken a big step towards becoming a veritable working class. Our Party and our veterans are happy for our great ideological harvest in the past few months. We should regard their happiness as a driving force to encourage ourselves to continue to move forward by leaps and bounds.

Our thoughts must constantly leap forward with the advance of the motherland. We must not be satisfied with the existing progress. We should see that the socialist era has raised the role of people to an unprecedented height, which requires us to be able to master the laws of social development and the laws of natural development; it requires us to be both masters of society and masters of nature. That is to say, the times require us young workers to be people with high political awareness, cultural accomplishment, and proficient production skills. Our Party has put forward the slogan of being both red and expert, being thoroughly red and deeply expert, which reflects precisely the requirements of history for our generation of young people. We must master advanced ideology and advanced technology at the same time. With advanced ideology and advanced technology, it is like adding two wings, being able to soar high and travel thousands of miles, making the greatest contribution to our beloved motherland.

How should our young workers achieve both red and expert and advance towards the road of being thoroughly red and deeply expert? The most important thing is: first, to increase ambition; second, to master technology; third, to study hard; fourth, to create bravely; fifth, to be diligent and frugal; and sixth, to unite and love each other.

Establish Revolutionary Ambition

What kind of ambition should we have? Ambition can be big or small, high or low, beautiful or ugly. "Thirty mu of land and a cow, a wife and children on a warm kang" is the ambition of a small farmer. "Clothes, leather shoes, vitamins, a fat son, a small family" is the ambition of a petty citizen. With only such ambition, there will be no far-sightedness, and it is impossible to do great things. What we should learn is the ambition of revolutionary predecessors to transform the old world and create a new world. One hundred and ten years ago, Marx and Engels, as two people, represented the world's proletariat in challenging the old world. Forty years ago, Lenin, unafraid of capitalist encirclement, firmly believed that the socialist revolution could first win victory in one country. Thirty years ago, when our country's revolution suffered serious setbacks and dark clouds shrouded the country, Chairman Mao declared to the people of the whole country in Jinggangshan: A single spark can start a prairie fire. Countless revolutionary martyrs took the world as their responsibility, and for the liberation of all mankind, they did not hesitate to go through life and death, shed blood and sacrifice. All this is the greatest, noblest, and most beautiful ambition, and it is the ambition that the young people of New China should have. The revolutionary predecessors have already done something earth-shattering, which is to turn our country from darkness to light and make our people from slaves to masters. Now it's our turn. We must also be determined to do a great thing. That is to make our country from poor to rich and from backward to advanced. That is to realize the great ideals of the working class in our generation, not only to build a socialist society, but also to build a communist society.

If you want to take, you must first give. To establish great ambition, you must discard all individualistic, low-level interests, and trivial things without the slightest regret. For example, some comrades are particularly interested in bonuses, promotions, and job selection. They are not only calculating on these issues, but also calculating ounce by ounce. If they are not satisfied, they become emotional and sleep under the covers. However, what do these things count compared with our great cause? If a person spends all day making a big fuss in the small world of individualism, then it is a low-level interest. Everyone has already seen the "Three Discoveries" exhibition. Among them, there is a Comrade Yang Zhaofa, who used to have a skill, that is, he was proficient in individual petty calculations. The top he wore was his own, and the pants were public. He wiped the oil stains on the pants. The result was that the top was clean and shiny, and the pants were oily and shiny. He was educated in the double-anti movement and wrote dozens of big-character posters, opening fire on his own individualistic thoughts. His awareness has been raised, and his production enthusiasm has also increased. We should welcome comrades like Yang Zhaofa who are brave in self-transformation. Comrade Song Tingxiang of Nanjing's speech about himself was even more touching. In the past, because of wage disputes, he "made himself feel depressed and gray all day long, like he was suffering from a serious illness." Later, he resolutely threw away individualism, and his mood became cheerful and his spirits were lifted. He made creations in production and increased production efficiency by six hundred times. A person resolutely discards the insignificant things of individualism, which is also to clear obstacles for establishing revolutionary ambition.

Revolutionary ambition must also be combined with the spirit of hard work. Before liberation, the ambition of revolutionaries was mainly manifested in heroic fighting in the struggle against the enemy. Today, the ambition of revolutionaries should mainly be manifested in heroic labor in production. What is heroic labor? That is: wherever the motherland wants us to go, we will go; whatever the motherland wants us to do, we will do; and whatever we do, we must do it well. In the past few years, we have had many such comrades. They were willing to go to places that others were unwilling to go; they were happy to do things that others were unwilling to do. There are also more comrades who, once they take on their jobs, deeply love the work, and concentrate on doing the work sincerely and honestly, like the young miner Ma Jinbao, who has not been absent for eleven years, and the silk reeling worker Zhu Canmao, who has not been absent for nine years; like the rural postman Li Hutian, who wholeheartedly serves the masses and has established a flesh-and-blood connection with the people; like the tricycle worker Li Xianfang, who loves his work and loyally serves the masses; like the young surveyor Wang Yongji, who overcomes numerous difficulties and puts the marker on the ascending mountain. They are the young people with this kind of revolutionary ambition. Some of them have been ridiculed by some people, saying that their work has no prospects. However, they were not captured by the prejudices left over from the old society. On the contrary, they raised their heads and did what they should do with confidence. If the ten million young workers in our country can all realize that the work they are undertaking is indispensable to the construction of the motherland, and treat their work like them, then our great ideals and great ambitions will surely become living facts.

The core issue of the Communist Youth League's ideological work is to help young people establish revolutionary ambitions. In order to achieve this goal, our comrades should often understand what young people are thinking and what they love; understand whose thoughts are shining and whose thoughts are moldy. We must often go to the masses, make friends with young people, talk to them, and give our hearts to them. We must talk to young people about the situation more often, open the windows of young people's minds, and let them think further and more broadly. We must often use the specific examples of advanced figures in the masses to teach young people how to combine lofty ideals with the spirit of hard work in practical work. The Party requires us to pay more attention to the ideological work of young people. We should put more effort into this aspect and strive to raise the thinking of our country's young people to a new height.

Must Strive to Master Technology

In order to realize our great ideals and ambitions, every young worker must strive to master technology. We are now at war with nature. Technology is the weapon to conquer nature. Without a gun, we cannot defeat the enemy. Without technology, we cannot conquer nature.

But what does it mean to master technology? That is, to have both skilled operating skills and the necessary technical theoretical knowledge. At present, for most of our young workers, the focus of mastering technology should be on mastering skilled operating skills. Some comrades think that as long as they understand the structure, performance, and other scientific knowledge of the machines, equipment, and tools of their trade, they have mastered the technology. This is not comprehensive. There are also some comrades who only master the operation of one or several processes and think that they are already skilled technicians, which is also not comprehensive. It should be known that all machines, equipment, and tools, if no one drives them or operates them, are dead things, a pile of useless things. If people without skilled technology drive it, it cannot fully exert its effectiveness. In this sense, operation is the basis for mastering technology, and skilled operation is the prerequisite for technological innovation.

Striving to learn operation, constantly improving the level of operation proficiency, and resolving to become a skilled technical worker in the shortest possible time are all urgent and of great significance for the broadest number of young workers in our country. Because only in this way can we meet the needs of the rapid expansion of new factories and mines in our country and the continuous increase of new equipment. Because only in this way can we give full play to the potential of existing production equipment, reduce labor intensity, reduce defective products, and reduce the phenomenon of damage to machines and equipment caused by unskilled technology.

### 人是我们伟大事业的决定因素  胡耀邦同志12日在全国青年工人代表会议上的报告

    人是我们伟大事业的决定因素
    胡耀邦同志12日在全国青年工人代表会议上的报告同志们：
    我们的这次会议就要胜利地结束了。在会上，有好些同志汇报了从整风运动以来，他们那里的青年职工怎样接受社会主义教育，提高了思想觉悟，因而对祖国作出了新的贡献。有好些同志讲了怎样勤勤恳恳地将自己的全部心血用在我们共同的事业上，因而战胜了重重困难，为祖国作出了优良的成绩。有好些同志讲了怎样开动脑筋，千方百计地寻找窍门，因而为祖国创造了许多财富。有好些同志讲了怎样刻苦钻研和顽强试验，因而在技术上作出了有价值的创造和发明。此外，还有好几位工人的老前辈，讲了他们如何用我国工人阶级的伟大品质，关怀和帮助青工同志在政治上和技术上迅速成长。毫无疑问，这都是最实际最生动的教材。我们相信，广大青年同志将从你们身上吸取到前进的力量。全国人民和毛主席，看到了你们的事迹，也一定会感到十分高兴。
    我们的事业大有希望
    我们的国家正处在又一次的社会主义高潮中。全国人民，在党的领导下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。我们大家都为祖国乘风破浪地前进感到欢欣鼓舞。用什么简单的语言来说明我们祖国现在的形势和我们祖国的前途呢？一句话，叫大有希望。
    人们对待事物的态度和观察事物的方法，是不一致的。因而对我们祖国的形势和前途，基本上也有三种不同的态度和三种不同的看法。一叫大有希望，一叫小有希望，一叫没有希望。
    有一种人，把我们的事业看作漆黑一团，说这也不行，那也不行；农业没有希望，工业也没有希望；党没有希望，搞社会主义也没有希望。他们反对党，反对社会主义。这就是资产阶级右派分子。现在，他们中有些人已经开始觉悟了，这当然是值得欢迎的。但是有些人仍然坚持自己的观点，并且准备把他们的反动观点带到棺材里去。中国历史上，人民的敌人都把我们的事业看作没有希望，而结果，没有希望的却恰恰是他们自己。因此，一切顽固的右派，又可叫做没有希望派。
    还有一种人，他们是我们革命队伍里的同志，他们认为我们的事业是有希望的，但是信心不足，劲头不大。人们认为可以快办的事情，他们认为只能慢慢来；人们认为可以彻底办好的事情，他们办到一半，就认为可以心满意足了；甚至人们认为可以办到的事情，他们认为办不到。坚持这种观点的人，就容易成为革命事业的保守派。保守派，又可叫小有希望派。
    我们是革命事业的促进派。在我们看来，摆在我们面前的一切事情，都是大有希望的。
    为什么我们的事业是大有希望的呢？
    我们的国家拥有九百六十万平方公里的广阔领土。我们的国家处在地球上气候最优良的地带。我们的国家蕴藏着应有尽有的丰富资源。世界上找不到几个国家有我们这样进行社会主义建设的有利的自然条件。
    但是，这还不是具有决定意义的东西。有决定意义的，首先是我们有中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导。我们党有能力率领我国人民争得解放，这一点，已经为历史证明了。我们党同样地有能力率领我国人民奔向富强，这一点，也正在为愈来愈多的人所信服。为什么人们愈来愈多地信服我们党的领导呢？这是因为，我们党在几年前就提出了一条清楚而明确的建设社会主义的路线，并且不断地规定着和不断地完善着为实现这条路线的各项政策。几年来的实践，特别是两次社会主义高潮的实践，有力地证明了党的这一路线和这些政策是完全正确的。党的路线和政策是指引我们前进的灯塔，是我们伟大事业的根本保证。我们的敌人，包括右派分子在内，最害怕的，正是我们党的引导我国人民从胜利走向胜利的路线和政策。因此，他们才集中力量攻击党的路线和政策，攻击那些坚决执行党的路线和政策的好干部。现在，我们的敌人是失算了，右派分子也被打垮了。对我们这些年轻的同志来说，又长了一次知识，又得到了一次教训，使我们懂得了什么叫热爱党。热爱党，最重要的就是要坚决相信党的路线和政策，坚决为党的路线和政策而奋斗。只要我们坚决地按照党的路线和政策办事，就可以胜利地向着我们伟大的目标前进。
    有决定意义的，还在于我们的国家有着占全世界人口四分之一的数量并且是已经争得了解放的人民。
    有这样一种悲观主义者，他们说：“不得了了，我们国家的人太多了。”似乎人多倒成了灾难。应该怎样来看待这个问题呢？我们马克思主义者认为，为了我们民族的健康和更好地抚育后一代，提倡有计划的生育是需要的。但是，我们国家的人多并不是坏事，而是好事。人多势众，人多力量大，这是一个很普通的道理。我们的朋友就以我们人多而气壮。我们的敌人就因为我们人多而不敢随便欺侮我们。而在我们的建设事业中，人，就是最重要的生产力；人，就是最宝贵的财富；人，就是我们伟大事业的决定因素。
    六万万人民，这是一个伟大的力量。这不仅是就数量而言，更重要的是我国人民是挣脱了锁链的人民，是觉醒了的人民，是组织起来了的人民，一句话，是已经掌握了自己命运的人民。在旧社会，当人民还处于被压迫和被奴役的时候，他们的劳动是为了少数剥削者。因此，他们的劳动积极性和创造性是受到压抑的。现在就完全不同了。人民的劳动是为社会，也是为自己。“人人为我，我为人人”，这个口号反映了这种新型的关系，也表达了人民团结起来自觉地创造历史的坚强意志。六亿人民从内心里所解放出来的力量，就像原子核分裂一样，要比历史上任何时期大几百倍、几千倍、几万倍。这种力量，就可以创造出我们的敌人所梦想不到的奇迹。大跃进以来的事实充分地证明了这一点。
    我国五亿农民，正在以万马奔腾的姿态迅速地改变着农村的面貌。四个月来，全国农民兴修的农田水利的灌溉面积，达到了二亿七千万亩。这比起我们祖先几千年来所修的二亿四千万亩，还要多三千多万亩。在同一期间，全国农民已积肥一千四百多亿担，平均每亩积肥八十五担，许多耕地都被二、三寸厚的肥料盖得乌黑一片。农民唱着这样的歌谣：“车不论，堆不论，施肥论几寸”，“红土坡，黄土坡，一律变黑坡”。有了水，有了肥，我们就完全可以预计，只要没有特大的自然灾害，今年我国将获得一个历史上从来没有过的大丰收。四个月来，我国的造林速度也是史无前例的。全国的造林面积已达二亿二千多万亩，超过了解放八年来造林面积的总和。按照这样的速度干下去，只要五年的时间就可以使我国绝大部分地区“有山皆绿，无水不清”。在生产大跃进的同时，农村的文化学习也搞得热火朝天。扫盲的速度大大加快了。有些县的青年，劲头很大，他们提出：“借眠一点钟，苦学三百天，一天十个字，十月识三千，消化一千五，成为无盲县”。现在看来，大约在三年左右的时间内，就可以基本上扫除全国青年中的文盲。在向四害所展开的空前猛烈的大扫荡中，全国人民，特别是广大青年，更表现了无比顽强的斗争意志，他们提出，要“让麻雀上天无路，让老鼠入地无门，让苍蝇蚊子断子绝孙，永不超生”。总之，我国的农村正在经历着又一次翻天复地的伟大变化。我国的社会主义农业是大有希望的。
    我国的七百万青年学生，热烈地响应党中央和毛主席的号召，正在开展勤工俭学活动，积极参加劳动锻炼，沿着又红又专的道路前进。他们今天是学校里的学生，明天就将是我国工农业劳动战线上的战士，是我国科学技术队伍的生力军。他们决心通过一面读书、一面劳动，一面学习、一面实践，使自己在没有参加祖国的建设以前，就培养起热爱劳动人民的感情和为人民服务的思想，就掌握起必要的建设祖国的知识和本领，并且为国家节省资金，锻炼自己独立生活的能力。因此，我国的青年学生也是大有希望的。
    年轻一代的历史任务
    我们国家的工业正在展翅高飞。为了多快好省地建设社会主义工业，我们的党在当前采取了这样几个重要的措施。这就是：深入地开展反浪费反保守运动，迅速地发展地方工业，广泛地进行技术革命。
    反浪费反保守运动，在全民整风运动的基础上，进一步克服了旧社会遗留下来的各种坏风气，使共产主义精神高涨起来，解放出了无穷无尽的潜力，打破了那些限制生产力发展的各种不合理的规章、制度，这就使得广大职工劳动的积极性和创造性得到进一步的发挥。原来建设一个大型钢铁企业的钱，现在可以建设两个了。许多工厂原来需要两年时间才能建设好的，现在只需要一年的时间了。地方工业正在以巨大的规模和速度向前发展。我们的国家是一个大国，一个省的资源和人力就相当于欧洲的一个国家。我们的地方工业有极广阔的前途。今后我们的国家将以大型工业为骨干，以中小型工业为基础，把发展大型工业和发展中小型工业结合起来。这就是说，中央、省、专区、县、乡、社都有自己的工业。我们国家工业的局面将是满天星斗，遍地开花。要使生产能够继续不断地跃进，就必须有先进的技术措施。所以我们要来一个技术革命。毛主席教导我们，要把世界上一切先进的生产技术都掌握过来，而且，还要有独创精神。人家有的，我们要有；人家没有的，我们也要有。我们一定要在最短时间内，把我国建设成为拥有现代装备和现代技术的世界上第一流的工业强国。
    我们国家的工业已经呈现出了一个非常宏伟的远景。根据目前情况估计，今年我国工业的总产值，将比去年增长33％。这个速度比第一个五年计划期间工业发展的平均速度要快一倍。许多省的地方工业的总产值，在五年到七年的时间内，将超过当地农业的总产值。照这样的速度发展下去，十五年以后，我们的国家就一定可以在钢铁和其他主要的工业产品方面赶上英国，甚至可以把英国抛在后面。
    我国的工业是这样迅速地发展，而我国工人阶级的老骨干却很少，技术力量又很薄弱。这就给我国工人阶级年轻的一代，带来了极其光荣、极其艰巨的历史任务。那末，我国青年工人的状况又是怎样的呢？我国现在有一千万青年职工，将近全国职工总数的一半。我们这些年轻的工人，朝气蓬勃，热烈地向往着祖国的未来，热情地追求着各种新鲜事物。我们每个人都不应该小看自己。但是，我们青年工人，大部分都是刚刚走出校门的学生，刚刚放下锄头的农民，无论在思想上、技术上都是很不成熟的，都是跟工人阶级所担负的重大责任不相适应的。资产阶级思想的影响，还会长期存在，还会利用我们不成熟的弱点来影响我们。因而，每一个青年丝毫也不应该忽视自己的弱点。毛主席教导我们，只有正确地认识了自己，才能更好地改造自己，只有改造了自己的主观世界，才能更好地改造客观世界。
    我们的党正是从青年工人的这种实际情况出发，因而在全民的整风运动中，特别号召我们青年工人进一步接受社会主义教育，自觉地改造自己的思想和立场。半年多来，由于各级党的组织的耐心教导，由于各级工会和共青团组织的帮助，也由于工人阶级老前辈的亲切关怀，广大青年工人的思想面貌起了深刻的变化。青年中的先进生产者越来越多了。青年突击队和青年先进班组的作用更加显著了。许多原来落后的同志赶上来了。先进的更加先进了。比先进、学先进、赶先进，在青年中已经形成一股汹涌澎湃的潮流。这就是说，伟大的整风运动，已经开始在我们青年工人的思想上开花结果。我们现在变得更坚强了，向名副其实的工人阶级迈进了一大步。我们的党，我们的老前辈，为了我们这几个月来思想上的大丰收而感到高兴。我们应该把他们的这种高兴当作鼓舞自己继续大踏步前进的动力。
    我们的思想必须跟着祖国的前进而不断跃进。我们决不能满足于现有的进步，我们应该看到，社会主义时代把人的作用提到了空前的高度，它要求我们既能够掌握社会发展的规律，又能够掌握自然发展的规律；要求我们既成为社会的主人，又成为大自然的主人。这就是说，时代要求我们青年工人应该是具有高度政治觉悟、有文化修养和精通生产技能的人。我们的党向我们提出了又红又专、红透专深的口号，这正是反映了历史对我们这一代青年的要求。我们必须把先进思想和先进技术同时掌握起来。有了先进思想和先进技术，就好比添了两个翅膀一样，能够振翼高飞，鹏程万里，为我们亲爱的祖国做出最大的贡献。
    我们青年职工应该怎样做到又红又专，向红透专深的道路前进呢？最主要的是，第一要增长志气，第二要掌握技术，第三要刻苦学习，第四要勇敢创造，第五要又勤又俭，第六要团结友爱。树立革命的大志气
    我们应该长什么样的志气呢？志气有大小之分，有高低之分，有美丑之分。“三十亩地一头牛，老婆娃娃热炕头”，这是小农的志气。“衣服皮鞋维他命，大胖儿子小家庭”，这是小市民的志气。只有这样的志气，就不会有远大的眼光，就不可能干出大事业来。我们要学习的，是革命前辈改造旧世界、创造新世界的志气。一百一十年前，马克思同恩格斯两个人，就代表了全世界无产者向旧世界挑战。四十年前，列宁不怕资本主义的包围，坚信社会主义革命可以首先在一个国家内取得胜利。三十年前，当我国革命遭到严重挫折，乌云笼罩着全国的时候，毛主席在井冈山向全国人民宣告：星星之火，可以燎原。无数的革命先烈，以天下为己任，为了解放全人类，不惜出生入死，流血牺牲。这一切，才是最伟大最高尚最美好的志气，才是新中国的青年应该具有的志气。革命的前辈们已经干了一件翻天复地的事情，这就是使我们的国家从黑暗变成了光明，使我国人民从奴隶变成了主人。现在轮到我们了。我们也要立志干一件大事情。这就是要使我们的国家，从贫穷变为富强，从落后变为先进。这就是要在我们这一代，实现工人阶级的远大理想，不但要建成社会主义社会，还要建成共产主义社会。
    若要取之，必先丢之。要树立大志气，就要毫不可惜地丢掉一切个人主义的、低级兴趣的、鸡毛蒜皮之类的小东西。比如有的同志对奖金、提级、挑工种特别感兴趣，对这些问题不仅是斤斤计较，而且是一两一两地计较，一不称心，就闹情绪，就蒙着被子睡大觉。但是，这些东西同我们的伟大事业相比较，又算得了什么呢？一个人如果整天在个人主义的小天地里大做文章，那就是低级兴趣了。大家已经看了“三发”展览会，其中有个杨照发同志，他过去有一种本领，就是精通个人小算盘。他穿的上衣是自己的，裤子是公家的，他就把油污擦在裤子上。结果是上衣干净得发光，裤子油得发光。在双反运动中他受到了教育，写了几十张大字报，向自己的个人主义思想开了火。他的觉悟提高了，生产干劲也大了。我们应该向杨照发这样勇于自我改造的同志表示欢迎。南京宋庭祥同志关于自己的发言，就更加动人。过去他因为闹工资，“把自己弄得心情苦闷，成天灰溜溜地，像害了大病一样。”后来他坚决地抛掉了个人主义，心情就舒畅了，精神就振作了，在生产上有了创造，把生产效率提高了六百倍。一个人坚决地丢掉了渺小的个人主义的东西，也就是为树立革命的志气扫清了障碍。
    革命的志气还必须同实干精神结合起来。解放以前，革命者的志气主要表现在对敌斗争中的英勇战斗。今天，革命者的志气主要应该表现在生产上的英勇劳动。什么是英勇的劳动呢？这就是：祖国要我们到哪里，我们就到哪里；祖国要我们干什么，我们就干什么；我们干了什么，就一定要把它干好。这几年来，我们有许多这样的同志，人家不愿意去的地方，他们心甘情愿地去了；人家不愿意干的事情，他们兴高彩烈地去干了。还有更多的同志，他们一走上自己的工作岗位，就深深地爱上了这个工作，就专心致意、诚诚恳恳地把这个工作做好，像十一年没有缺勤的青年矿工马金保同志和九年没有缺勤的缫丝女工朱蚕毛同志；像全心全意为群众服务，和人民建立了血肉联系的乡村邮递员李虎天同志；像热爱自己的工作，忠诚为群众服务的三轮车工人李贤芳同志；像战胜重重困难，把觇标插上升山的青年测量工王永吉同志。他们就是这种具有革命志气的青年。他们中有好些同志，都曾经遭受到某些人的讥笑，说他们的工作没有出息。但是，他们并没有被这种旧社会所遗留下来的偏见所俘虏，相反，他们昂起头来，理直气壮地做了自己应该做的事情。我国一千万青年职工，如果都能够认识到自己所担负的工作都是祖国建设事业所不可缺少的，都像他们那样对待自己的工作，那末，我们伟大的理想和伟大的志气，就一定能够变成活生生的事实。
    共青团思想工作的核心问题，就是要帮助青年树立革命志气。为了达到这个目的，我们的同志应该经常了解青年在想些什么，爱些什么；了解哪些同志的思想在发光，哪些同志的思想在发霉。我们要经常到群众中去，同青年交朋友，同他们谈心，把心交给他们。要多同青年讲形势，打开青年思想的窗户，让他们想得更远，更宽广。要经常运用群众中先进人物的具体榜样，来教会青年怎样在实标工作中把远大的理想和实干的精神结合起来。党要求我们更好地注意青年的思想工作，我们应该在这方面下更多的功夫，努力把我国青年的思想提高到一个新的高度。
    必须努力掌握技术
    为了实现我们伟大的理想和志气，每一个青工同志都必须努力掌握技术。我们现在是向自然开战。技术就是征服自然的武器。没有枪，就打不倒敌人。没有技术，就不能征服自然。
    可是，什么叫掌握技术呢？这就是，既要有熟练的操作技能，又要有必要的技术理论知识。而在当前，对我们大多数青工同志来说，掌握技术的重点应该放在掌握熟练的操作技能上。有些同志以为，只要懂得了自己这一行工种的机器、设备和工具的构造、性能以及其它的一些科学知识，就是掌握技术了。这是不全面的。还有一些同志，只掌握了一个或几个工序的操作，就认为已经是熟练的技工了，这也是不全面的。应该知道，一切机器、设备和工具，如果没有人去驾驭它，操作它，它就是死东西，就是一堆毫无用处的东西。如果没有熟练技术的人去驾驭它，也不能充分发挥它的效能。从这个意义上说，操作是掌握技术的基础，熟练的操作是技术革新的前提。
    努力学会操作，不断地提高操作的熟练程度，决心使自己在最短的时间内成为一个熟练的技术工人，对于我国最广大的青年工人来说，都是一件迫切的具有重大意义的事情。因为只有这样，才能满足我国新的厂矿迅速扩大、新的设备不断增加的需要。因为只有这样，我们才能充分发挥现有的生产设备的潜力，才能减轻劳动强度，减少废次品，减少那种由于技术不熟练而造成的损坏机器设备的现象。
