Xinhua News Agency, London, April 7th. The Easter "Ban the Bomb" march, which set off from Trafalgar Square in London four days ago, triumphantly reached its destination today: Aldermaston, the site of the British nuclear weapons research center. The marchers, joined by local residents, held a grand rally of over ten thousand people right outside the high barbed wire fence of this nuclear weapons research center.

Those who marched the entire fifty miles, those who joined along the way, and those who came from as far away as Cornwall in western England all converged. A total of five thousand people arrived in Aldermaston. Finally, several thousand more gathered on the mile-long road leading to the venue at the end of the march, cheering and applauding the marchers.

Some of the marchers had sore feet, but their spirits were as high as when they left Trafalgar Square. Tireless fathers and mothers were still pushing their babies in strollers. Charles Martin, a sixty-five-year-old with white hair who had marched all the way from London, was still holding a sign demanding the abolition of nuclear armaments at the head of the march.

The Baker family, a construction worker's family of eight who all participated in the march, received cheers from the crowd upon arriving in Aldermaston.

Young people cheered, sang, and waved flags, demanding peace instead of war, negotiations instead of nuclear tests, no hydrogen bombs, and no establishment of rocket bases in Britain.

Some London folk dancers participating in the march performed traditional Scottish dances at the entrance of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, attracting a large crowd.

American black singer Bayard Rustin, who volunteered to sail on a double-masted ship to the US nuclear test area in the Pacific to protest the tests, said at the Aldermaston rally that a victory against the nuclear arms race was possible in Britain. He said, "You must say to the US government: 'Take your bomber bases back!' I urge the people of Britain today to declare your independence as the Americans did in 1776. In doing so, you will be doing a great service to my country as well."

Stephen Swingler, a left-wing Labour MP and chairman of the "Victory for Socialism" group, said at the rally: This march symbolizes the desire of millions of people to break out of the valley of death shrouded in shadows and to establish brotherly friendship.

He said: I am prepared to defend Britain's independence by force, but I cannot support the threat of indiscriminate mass destruction with nuclear weapons and the race to spread disease and terror caused by nuclear testing.

Niemöller, a West German churchman who had been imprisoned in a Hitler concentration camp and one of the leaders of the West German anti-nuclear weapons movement, also attended the rally. In his speech, he emphasized the need to avoid the disaster and destruction that nuclear weapons could cause.

All those who spoke at the rally called for continued efforts to abolish nuclear armaments.

The conference passed a resolution, signed by thousands of marchers and mass meeting participants, calling on "the British, Russian, and American governments to immediately cease the testing, manufacture, and storage of nuclear weapons."

The resolution will be delivered to British Prime Minister Macmillan tomorrow.

After the mass rally, many people remained in Aldermaston, where they kept vigil day and night in shifts at the main gate of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, protesting the government's nuclear arms race policy.

    英国和平大军堵住了氢弹工厂大门
    阿尔德马斯顿万人集会要求停止核试验
    新华社伦敦7日电　四天以前从伦敦特拉法加广场出发的复活节“不要氢弹”大游行队伍今天胜利地到达游行的终点——英国核武器研究中心所在地阿尔德马斯顿。游行队伍同当地群众汇合起来，就在这个核武器研究中心的高高的铁丝网外面举行了一次一万多人的盛大集会。
    那些游行了全程五十英里的人们和那些在半路上参加的以及从远至柯恩瓦尔郡的西英格兰一带前来的人们汇合在一起。他们到达阿尔德马斯顿的时候一共有五千人。最后还有好几千人聚集在游行终点通往会场的一英里长的公路上，他们对游行队伍欢呼和鼓掌。
    有些游行的人把脚走疼了，但是，他们的情绪同他们离开特拉法加广场的时候一样高昂。不知疲倦的父亲母亲们仍然用婴儿车推着他们的婴儿。从伦敦一路走来的白发苍苍的六十五岁的老人查尔斯·马丁仍然拿着要求取消核军备的标语牌走在游行队伍的前面。
    全家八口人都参加了游行的建筑工人培克一家在到达阿尔德马斯顿的时候受到了群众的欢呼。
    青年们欢呼、歌唱和挥舞旗帜，要求和平而不要战争，要求谈判而不要核试验，不要氢弹，不要在英国建立火箭基地。
    参加游行的一些伦敦民间舞蹈家们在原子武器研究中心的入口处表演了传统的苏格兰舞蹈，他们吸引了大批的群众。
    自愿乘双桅船到太平洋美国进行核试验地区去抗议试验的美国黑人歌唱家贝阿德·腊斯廷在阿尔德马斯顿的群众集会上说，在英国有可能取得反对核武器竞赛的胜利。他说，“你们必须对美国政府说：‘把你们的轰炸机基地撤回去！’我劝告今天的英国人民像美国人在1776年一样宣告你们的独立。这样，你们也就为我国作了一件大好事。”
    工党左翼议员、“争取社会主义胜利”集团主席斯蒂芬·斯文格勒在集会上说：这次游行象征着千百万人民渴望冲出阴影笼罩着的死亡之谷而要求建立兄弟般的友爱关系。
    他说：我准备以武力维护英国的独立，但是，我不能支持威胁用核武器来进行不加区别的大规模毁灭和竞相散布核试验所引起的疾病和恐怖。
    曾经被投入希特勒集中营的西德教会人士、西德反对核武器运动的领导人之一尼穆勒也参加了这次集会。他在发言中强调必须避免核武器所可能造成的灾难和毁灭。
    所有在集会上发言的人都要求为争取取消核军备而继续努力。
    大会通过了一项由成千的参加游行和群众大会的人签名的决议，呼吁“英国、俄国和美国政府立即停止试验、制造和储存核武器”。
    这项决议将在明天送交英国首相麦克米伦。
    群众大会散会以后，许多人仍然留在阿尔德马斯顿，他们在那里日夜轮流看守着原子武器研究中心的正门，抗议政府的核军备竞赛政策。
