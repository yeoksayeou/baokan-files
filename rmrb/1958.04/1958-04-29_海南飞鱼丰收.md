Hainan Flying Fish Harvest
    (By our correspondent) The warm weather and high water temperatures this spring were conducive to early spawning, resulting in an earlier flying fish season than in previous years. Furthermore, the fish schools migrated closer to the shallow seas. Fishermen in Wenchang, Qiongdong, Lehui, and other counties broke with convention and went to sea for production more than ten days before the "Qingming" Festival. Currently, several hundred flying fish boats from Wenchang, Qiongdong, Lehui, and Wanning counties are gathered in the Qizhou Yang fishing grounds to catch flying fish, and reports of bumper harvests are pouring in. The first and second batches of flying fish boats from Liangshan Township and Qinggang Township in Wenchang County returned fully loaded. Zhuang Jin Yu, a flying fish boat from Liangnan Cooperative in Qinggang Township with a carrying capacity of eighty dan, caught forty-six dan of flying fish in two days after setting sail on April 3. Flying fish boats from Tanqing Township in Qiongdong County are also returning fully loaded. Chen Xianqiang's boat from the cooperative caught thirty-five dan of flying fish in two days of operation at sea. Fishermen in various parts of the county are also implementing various operations, combining flying fish capture with longline fishing, handline fishing, and trolling to strive for greater production increases.

    海南飞鱼丰收
    本报讯　今年春汛气候温暖，水温高，适于早产卵，因而飞鱼汛比往年都来得早，且鱼群洄游近浅海，文昌、琼东、乐会等县渔民都打破常规，提早在“清明”前十多天出海生产。目前文昌、琼东、乐会和万宁四县有几百条飞鱼船云集在七洲洋渔场捕捉飞鱼，并纷纷传来丰收喜报，文昌县良山乡和清港乡第一、二批出海的飞鱼船都是满载归来，清港乡良南社庄近裕一只载重八十担的飞鱼鱼艇，4月3日出海两天就捕得飞鱼四十六担。琼东县潭青乡出海的飞鱼船，每船都满载而归，社员陈献强船出海作业两天，就捕获三十五担飞鱼。该县各地渔船还实行多种作业，捕捉飞鱼时兼放延绳钓、手钓、拖毛钓，争取更大的增产。
