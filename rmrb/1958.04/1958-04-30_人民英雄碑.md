    Monument to the People's Heroes
    Guo Moruo
    Tiananmen Square, a vast and magnificent ocean, the Monument to the People's Heroes stands in the center—solemn, simple, pure, persevering, steady, and generous, like a lofty lighthouse radiating light.
    Please look, the heroic images of more than a hundred years, sacrificing their lives to strive for national independence and liberation; pressing forward wave upon wave, supporting each other, attacking from the west and defending from the east, giants are throwing mountains and stirring up floods.
    Burning opium and firing the first shot of resistance; the Jintian Uprising almost destroyed the feudal dynasty; the Xinhai Revolution, arising from the road protection movement and the Wuchang Uprising, finally brought about the Five Races Republic, and the dragon flag was replaced with a new look.
    However, the democratic revolution was merely changing the soup without changing the ingredients, replacing it with warlord separatism that was even more stubborn than the imperial system; imperialism manipulated big and small Zhang Bangchangs, gradually moving towards the path of semi-colonialism.
    Youthful students in front of Tiananmen walked onto the battlefield, and the May Fourth Movement unveiled a new chapter in history; the flags of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism were clearly raised high, and at this time the party leading the revolution was brewing.
    The May Thirtieth Movement under the leadership of the Party was magnificent, and the Chinese proletariat finally showed its strength; the great revolutionary storm swept across all directions, and the Northern Warlords were like fallen leaves in the autumn wind.
    Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei surrendered to the enemy one after another, and those who were forced to revolt became the objects of the revolution.
    The revolutionary armed forces led by the Party launched the Nanchang Uprising, and the beacon of August 1st brought the People's Liberation Army onto the stage.
    Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal brought about the madness of the Japanese invaders, losing the Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South, retreating step by step.
    The revolutionary armed forces, after the 25,000-li Long March, persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, and finally brought about the surrender of the Japanese invaders.
    American imperialism then inherited the example of the Japanese invaders, supporting Chiang Kai-shek, launching a civil war, and being extremely arrogant; however, the power of the Party liberated the Northeast and North China, truly like a hot knife through butter, crossing the Yangtze River in one fell swoop.
    Eight million counter-revolutionary armed forces were wiped out, and the imperialist policy of aggression against China was a pipe dream.
    A hundred years of hard struggle brought about the flying of the five-star red flag, and 600 million people were liberated, thanks to the Chinese Communist Party.
    "The Chinese people have stood up!" On Tiananmen, the Chairman's announcement eight years ago was louder than thunder.
    "Eternal glory to the people's heroes" radiates golden light, shining on the communist world, for ten thousand years without end.

    人民英雄碑
    郭沫若天安门广场，波澜壮阔的海洋，人民英雄纪念碑屹立在中央——庄严、朴素、纯洁、坚忍、稳重、大方，像崇高的灯塔在放射着光芒。请看，一百多年来的英雄形象，牺牲生命，争取民族独立解放；前仆后继，左提右挈，西杀东挡，巨人们在投掷山岳，卷起洪浪。焚毁鸦片放出反抗的第一枪；金田起义使封建王朝几乎灭亡；辛亥革命，由保路而起义武昌，终使五族共和，龙旗换了新样。然而民主革命是不换药而换汤，换来军阀割据比帝制还要顽强；帝国主义操纵着大小的张邦昌，向着半殖民地的道路逐步走上。天安门前青年学生走上了战场，五四运动为历史揭出新的一章；反帝、反封建的旗帜鲜明地高扬，在这时正酝酿着领导革命的党。党领导下的五卅运动阵势堂堂，中国的无产阶级终于显出力量；革命的大风暴席卷着四面八方，北洋军阀像西风中的败叶一样。蒋介石、汪精卫先后向敌人投降，被迫革命的人成为革命的对象。党所领导的革命武力起义南昌，八一的烽火使人民解放军登场。蒋介石的叛变招来了日寇的疯狂，失去东北、华北、华东、中南，步步退让。经过二万五千里长征的革命武装，坚持敌后游击战，终于使日寇投降。美帝国主义又承继着日寇榜样，扶助蒋介石，发动内战，万分嚣张；然而党的力量使东北、华北解放，真是势如破竹，一举渡过了长江。八百万的反革命武装遭到扫荡，帝国主义的侵华政策春梦一场。百年的苦斗换来五星红旗飘扬，六亿人民翻身，感谢中国共产党。“中国人民站起来了！”在天安门上，八年前主席的宣告比雷霆响亮。“人民英雄永垂不朽”焕发着金光，辉映着共产主义世界，万年无疆。
