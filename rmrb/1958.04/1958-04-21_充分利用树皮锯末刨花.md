    News from our newspaper: The forestry departments are studying how to fully utilize waste materials from forest harvesting and wood processing, in order to reduce timber waste. It is estimated that during the Second Five-Year Plan, the various state-owned forest farms and wood processing plants will have ten million cubic meters of waste materials, including tree branches, tree bark, sawdust, shavings, treetop wood, and slab wood. The forestry departments plan to gradually build a number of fiberboard factories, particleboard factories, cardboard factories, pulp mills, and alcohol factories to systematically utilize these waste materials. It is estimated that the products made from ten million cubic meters of waste materials can replace twelve million six hundred thousand cubic meters of logs. It can also produce 100,000 tons of alcohol and 25,000 tons of feed yeast.

    本报讯　林业部门正在研究怎样充分开伐森林和木材加工时的废料，以减少木材的浪费。预计在第二个五年计划期间各个国营林场和木材加工厂所有的树桠、树皮、锯末、刨花、梢头木、板皮等废材有一千万立方公尺，林业部门计划陆续兴建一批纤维板厂、刨花板厂、厚纸板厂、纸浆厂、酒精厂等来有计划利用这批废材。据估计：一千万立方公尺废材制出的产品可代替一千二百六十万立方公尺原木。还可生产十万吨酒精和二万五千吨饲料酵母。
