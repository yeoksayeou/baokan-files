The Peace Agricultural Cooperative in Nanzhan Township, Wenshang County, Shandong Province, has over 400 mu of sandy land where no one dared to dig wells before, resulting in frequent droughts and reduced yields. During last winter's water conservancy construction, they started digging the first well, but it collapsed before reaching water. Continuing to dig, it collapsed again, and all the well-digging tools were buried. Captain Wang Chuanpei was also buried up to his waist by the sand. Failing to overcome this hurdle would prevent a leap forward in production. Therefore, the management committee mobilized everyone to brainstorm solutions. Wang Chuanpei and management committee member Wang Chuanqing studied and researched repeatedly, finally thinking of using a cloth sack to scoop the sand. They drilled holes in the ends of wooden forks, placed a large sickle-shaped iron plate (30 to 35 cm long and 5 cm wide) on the fork head, sharpened one side, and then securely tied the cloth sack to the fork's legs with thin hemp rope. Each fork leg had a 4 to 5 meter long thin hemp rope tied to its middle. In a field test, one person held the fork handle and shoveled downwards, pushing the fork head into the sand, while another person pulled the rope randomly on the opposite side, causing the sand to flow into the cloth sack. The two people then lifted the fork head, and it was full of sand. The experiment was a success. The cooperative immediately used this new tool and quickly dug thirteen quicksand wells. Digging each well saved seventy workdays and forty yuan compared to before.

    和平社创挖沙工具
    沙地打井有了办法
    本报讯　山东汶上县南站乡和平农业社，有四百多亩沙地从来没有人敢在这里打井，因此经常受旱减产。去冬水利建设中，开始打第一眼井没打到水就塌了，再继续打，又塌了，全部打井工具都被压到底下。队长王传配也叫沙压住了半截身子。这一关突不破，生产就没法跃进。于是，管理委员会发动大家共同开动脑筋想办法。王传配和管理委员王传庆等人研究了再研究，最后想到用布兜子捞沙。他们把木杈子梢上钻上孔，木杈头上放上大镰刀式的铁板（长三十公分到三十五公分，宽五公分），一边开刃，然后在杈股上用细麻绳把布兜拴结实，每根杈股半腰拴一根四、五公尺长的细麻绳。实地一试，一个人拿着杈把往下铲，使杈头伸到沙里，一个人拿着绳子对面乱拉，使沙流入布兜里，两个人同时把杈头提出，一看，满兜子是沙，试验成功了。社里立即运用起这新工具，很快就打成了十三眼流沙井。打一眼井，就比从前能节省七十个工和四十元钱。
