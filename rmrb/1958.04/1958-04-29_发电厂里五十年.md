    "Fifty Years in a Power Plant"
      "Fifty Years in a Power Plant" is a historical story book with vivid language and simple stories. It recounts the changes in the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant since its construction, as well as the lives and struggles of the workers. The entire book is mainly based on oral materials from veteran workers, compiled by the writer Pan Zhiting. It records real people and events, with only some names changed.
    From these historical facts, people can see how the working class, in the difficult days of the old society, carried out arduous struggles under extremely harsh working and living conditions. At the same time, they can also see how the working class, under the leadership of the Party, has rapidly grown, developed, and become stronger.
    The hardships of the past and the happiness of today are in stark contrast, which will prompt people to love today's life even more, love the superior socialist system even more, and love our great Party!

    “发电厂里五十年”
      “发电厂里五十年”是一本语言生动、故事朴实的历史故事书。它记述了北京石景山发电厂自建厂以来的变化和工人的生活和斗争。全书主要内容都是老工人口述的材料，由作家潘芷汀编写，其中记的都是真人真事，只是姓名有些改动。
    从这些历史事实中，人们可以看到：在旧社会苦难的日子里，工人阶级怎样在极端恶劣的劳动条件和生活条件下，进行艰苦的斗争，同时也可以看到：工人阶级在党的领导下，在如何飞速地成长、发展和壮大。
    过去的艰苦和今天的幸福成为鲜明的对照，会促使人们更加热爱今天的生活、更加热爱优越的社会主义制度和我们伟大的党！
