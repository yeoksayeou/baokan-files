Meetings Should Strive for Good and Economy
    Tian Fang
    From February 19th to March 15th, for a total of twenty-five days, the activities of the main cadres of Maoshan Township in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, were as follows: Tang Changyu, the Party Secretary, spent five days in the county for meetings, plus one day for travel back and forth, totaling six days. He spent seven days going back to "implement" the decisions, holding seven meetings in total. Preparation before the meetings and arrangements afterward also took seven days. The remaining time for participating in labor and activities among the masses was only five days.
    Wang Hesheng, the Deputy Secretary, went to the county twice, once to study rectification and once to visit, totaling seven days. After returning to the township, apart from researching with the Party Committee and attending township and commune meetings, only four days were left to participate in labor and immerse himself among the masses.
    In addition, Deputy Secretary Zhang Changyi went to Chenwu Township for a field meeting for three days, to Tianwang Temple for a health meeting for one and a half days, and held meetings in the township and commune for eight days. Township Head Qi Zhengwen spent four days in the county for the general election meeting, and another eight days attending meetings in the township. Pan Xuren, the Secretary of the Communist Youth League, spent four days in the county for a public security meeting, three days for a forestry meeting, three days for a visit, two days attending a meeting at the county League Committee, two days at a League meeting in Ersheng Bridge, and five days attending three meetings in the township and commune, totaling nineteen days of meetings.
    Many meetings indicate that activities in all aspects are intensifying during the Great Leap Forward, and everyone wants to do more and better work, striving to be the best. This should be considered a good phenomenon. Compared to certain quiet and deserted periods in the past, the current tense, busy, and vigorous situation is satisfying and extremely beneficial to promoting the socialist construction cause.
    However, meetings also need to be good and economical. Good means solving problems, and economical means saving time. In order to realize the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule and reach the "four, five, eight" and other targets ahead of schedule, people are working hard. In addition to working alongside the masses, grassroots cadres must also frequently understand the ideological problems and practical difficulties among the masses and help them solve them. This requires frequent individual contact with the masses, collective talks, organization of discussions and debates, and handling of various specific affairs. Without these regular activities, it is impossible to raise the consciousness of the masses through movements, and to promote the movement based on the increased consciousness of the masses. Holding meetings well and economically can help cadres continuously improve their work among the masses and increase efficiency. If the meetings are too long, too frequent, and of poor quality, they cannot achieve this goal, but instead waste a lot of effort and squeeze out the time for cadres to go deep into the masses and into practice, resulting in detachment from reality, detachment from the masses, and the development of bureaucracy. In this way, meetings go from promoting work to the opposite – hindering work.
    In order to hold meetings well, solve problems, the comrades who organize and lead the meetings should prepare in advance, so that the problems are few and concentrated, and can be quickly resolved during the meetings. In order to reduce meetings and save everyone's time, leaders at all levels must make overall arrangements for various meetings within a certain period, merging those that can be merged, not holding those that can be avoided, and adopting other methods to replace the role of meetings. The general principle should be to squeeze out as much time as possible to allow everyone to participate in activities among the masses, understand the situation, solve problems, and participate more in physical labor, cultivate experimental fields well, and continuously improve in agricultural knowledge and technology, so as to achieve both "red" and "expert."

    会议要力求好省
    田方
    江苏句容县茅山乡从2月19日到3月15日，共二十五天，主要干部的活动情形如下：党委书记唐昌玉，在县里开了五天会，一来一去跑了一天，共六天。回去“贯彻”，开了七个会议，共用七天。会前准备和会后布置，也用了七天。剩下参加劳动和在群众中活动的时间，只有五天。
    副书记王合生，到县二次，一次研究整风，一次参观，共用七天。回乡后除了和党委研究及参加乡、社会议，只剩四天时间可以参加劳动和深入群众。
    此外，副书记张昌义到陈武乡开现场会议三天，到天王寺开卫生会议一天半，在乡、社开会八天。乡长齐正文到县开普选会四天，在乡里又参加会议八天。共青团书记潘绪仁，在县里开治安会议四天，林业会议三天，参观三天，到团县委开会二天，在二圣桥开团的会议二天，回乡、社开了三次会，共用五天，总共开会十九天。
    会议多，表示各方面的活动在大跃进中都紧张起来了，大家都想把工作搞得更多更好，力争上游。这应当说是一个好现象。与过去某些冷冷清清的时期相比，现在这种紧张忙碌，轰轰烈烈的局面是痛快的，对推进社会主义建设事业极其有利的。
    但是，会议也需要讲究好和省。好就是解决问题，省就是节省时间。为了提前实现农业发展纲要，提前达到“四、五、八”和其他指标，人们都在紧张地劳动。基层干部除了要同群众一块劳动，还要经常了解群众中的思想问题和实际困难，帮助群众解决。这就需要经常同群众个别接触，集体谈话，组织讨论和辩论，处理各种具体事务。没有这些经常的工作，就不能经过运动提高群众觉悟，又在群众觉悟提高的基础上推进运动。会议开得好和省，可以帮助干部不断地改进他们在群众中的工作，提高效率。开得时间太长，次数太多，质量不好，就不能达到这个目的，反而白白浪费许多工夫，挤掉了干部深入到群众中和实际中去的时间，结果是脱离实际，脱离群众，官僚主义发展。这样，会议就从推进工作走向了它的反面——妨害工作。
    为了会议开得好，解决问题，组织和领导会议的同志就应当事前做好准备，问题少而集中，能够在开会时很快求得解决。为了减少会议，节省大家时间，各地领导上就必须在一定时期内统筹安排各种会议，能合并的合并，能不开的不开，采取另外一些办法来代替会议的作用。总的原则，应当是尽量挤出时间来让大家多到群众中去活动，了解情况，解决问题，并且多参加体力劳动，种好试验田，在农业知识和技术上不断提高，达到又红又专。
