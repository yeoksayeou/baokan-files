Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 25th: The Hubei Provincial People's Committee held a local industry conference from the 14th to the 23rd to exchange experiences in the nationwide effort to develop industry. This helped leading cadres from various special districts and counties to dispel the mystique surrounding industry and greatly increased their confidence in vigorously developing local industries.

Many county leaders at the meeting used vivid examples to introduce their experiences in establishing medium-sized, small-sized, and very small-sized factories with little investment and quick returns. Enshi established six small copper factories with an investment of only 100 yuan each. Each factory has two workers and can smelt 800 jin of copper per month, with an output value of 800 yuan, not counting other by-products. Ammonium sulfate made by Lichuan County using "indigenous methods" has a nitrogen content of 19.9%, not much different from ammonium sulfate produced with modern equipment. Its production equipment is very simple, requiring only five wooden buckets, four pots, and eight people to produce 200 jin per day and night; the raw material is the residue left over from local sulfur refining. Yangxin County has also successfully trial-produced fertilizer using "indigenous methods" and plans to produce 40,000 tons this year. The Yujiakou Iron Plant in Lichuan County expanded a pig iron mine with a daily output of five tons, completing construction in three and a half months. The investment was 75,000 yuan, and the annual output value reached 315,000 yuan, with a net profit of 110,000 yuan. The furnace was built with locally produced white sandstone, which did not cost any money.

Many facts show that the wisdom of the masses in running industry is infinite. In Zigui, a member of a handicraft cooperative named Peng Mingxi invented a water-powered automatic flour mill that can grind 600 jin of flour per day. This flour mill can also drive cotton ginning and cotton fluffing machines, producing 60 comforters a day. Xingshan County utilized a canal to establish a water-powered processing plant. It has two power disks, one driving a shelling machine and the other driving machines for blacksmithing, rice milling, chopping grass, and cutting pig feed. This water-powered processing plant was created by a secretary of the CPC district committee who had only one year of schooling and a carpenter.

These great creations and moving examples from the masses provided the leaders at all levels who attended the meeting with a profound lesson, dispelled superstition, overcame the ideas of pursuing large scale, novelty, and comprehensiveness, and recognized that looking downward, relying closely on the masses, thinking of more simple solutions, and establishing more medium-sized, small-sized, and very small-sized industries is the correct path to developing local industry in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    办工业并不神秘
    湖北交流办厂经验　各级干部信心倍增
    据新华社武汉25日电　湖北省人民委员会在14日到23日召开的地方工业会议上交流了全民办工业的经验，使参加会议的各专区、县领导干部破除了办工业的神秘观点，大大地增强了大搞地方工业的信心。
    许多县的负责人在会上用生动的事例，介绍了投资少、收效快的办中型、小型和小小型工厂的经验。恩施办了六个小铜厂，投资只一百元。一个厂两个工人，每月就可冶炼八百斤铜，产值八百元，其他副产品还未计算在内。利川县用“土法”制成的硫酸铵，含氮量19.9％，比用现代化设备生产的硫酸铵的含氮量差不了多少。而它的制作设备却很简单，只用五只木桶、四口锅，八个人一昼夜就能生产二百斤；原料是用当地炼硫磺剩下的脚渣。阳新县也用“土法”试制成功化肥，今年就计划生产四万吨。利川县鱼家口铁厂扩建一座日产五吨的炼铁矿，三个半月就建成了，投资七万五千元，一年产值就达三十一万五千元，纯利十一万元。这座炉是用当地出产的、不用花钱的白沙石砌筑的。
    不少事实说明，群众办工业的智慧是无穷的。秭归有一个手工业社社员叫彭明锡，他发明的水力自动磨面机，一天可磨六百斤面。这架磨面机还能带动轧花、弹花机，一天能制出六十条被絮。兴山县利用水渠建立了一个水力加工厂。它有两个动力盘，一个带动剥壳机，一个带动打铁、碾米、铡草、切猪菜的机器。这个水力加工厂是由一个只读过一年书的中共区委书记和一个木工创造出来的。
    群众的这些伟大创举和动人事例，使到会的各级领导干部上了深刻的一课，破除了迷信，克服了求大求新求全的思想，认识到眼睛向下，紧紧依靠群众，多想穷办法，多办中型、小型和小小型工业，是多快好省地发展地方工业的正确道路。
