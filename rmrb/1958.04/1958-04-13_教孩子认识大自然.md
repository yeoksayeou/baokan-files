    Teaching Children to Know Nature
    Guo Yishi
    “Are there people in the sky?” If a child asks such a question, I think there might be four ways to answer:
    (1) “Stop bothering me, always asking this and that.”
    (2) “You’ll know when you grow up.”
    (3) “No.”
    (4) “What do you think?”
    “I think there are.”
    “How do you know there are?”
    “Sometimes when it rains, I hear rumbling in the sky.”
    “That’s thunder.”
    “Who makes the thunder? What does thunder look like?”
    It seems that this fourth way of answering is the best. This kind of inductive answering method will never block children's thinking, and it keeps their thinking in a positive and excited state.
    From the fourth type of question and answer, we can know that the child's question "Are there people in the sky?" is not wild speculation, but is based on something. His basis is: "When it rains, there is a rumbling sound in the sky." Look! He has personally "observed" nature.
    Observation - this is an important step in understanding nature. In order to correctly explain natural phenomena to children, we must first guide them to carefully observe nature.
    Do you want to explain to your child what air is? He can't "see" it, and he won't understand no matter how long you talk. Then, you can ask him: What blows the branches so that they rustle? What propels sailboats on the water? Can’t see it? You can do some simple experiments. In this way, he will understand: air exists, air has pressure, and so on.
    Not only scientific experiments, but even some simple labor can enhance children's understanding of the properties of various substances. Such as planting flowers, planting trees, growing vegetables, raising chickens, raising rabbits, eliminating the four pests, folding paper boats, making gliders, washing clothes... and so on. There are endless examples. Through these labors, children will understand many simple scientific principles, and they will gain a lot of perceptual knowledge in light labor.
    Of course, relying solely on children's own observations, experiments, and labor is far from enough. We must also induce children to read popular and vivid books. Books can open up children's horizons, reveal the entire fascinating world to them, and ignite their ardent desire to explore and transform nature.
    Helping children understand the natural world, although not so easy, is not an impossible task. We only need to teach children to identify common animals, plants, and minerals according to their shapes, understand the relationships between them, their main properties, and how humans use them.
    This is the primary stage, however, it is a very meaningful beginning.

    教孩子认识大自然
    郭以实
    “天上有人没有？”如果孩子提出这样一个问题，我想，可能有四种回答方法：
    （一）“烦死了，老是问这问那的。”
    （二）“你长大了就知道了。”
    （三）“没有”。
    （四）“你说有没有？”
    “我说有”。
    “你怎么知道有？”
    “我有时听见下雨时，天上咕隆咕隆地响。”
    “那是打雷。”
    “谁打的雷？雷是甚么样？”
    看来，这第四种回答方法是最好的了。这种诱发式的回答法决不会把孩子们的思路堵死，它使孩子们的思考始终处于积极的兴奋状态。
    从第四类问答中可以知道：孩子提出“天上有人没有？”并不是胡思乱想出来的，他是有根据的。他的根据就是：“下雨时，天上咕隆咕隆地响”，瞧！他亲自“观察”过自然呢。
    观察——这是认识自然的重要步骤。为了正确地向孩子们说明自然现象，首先就得引导他们细心地观察自然。
    你要想向孩子说明空气是怎么一回事吗？他“看”不见，听你说半天他也莫名其妙。那么，你可以问问他：是什么吹得树枝呼呼的响？是什么推动了帆船在水上航行？看不见吗？你可以做几个简单的实验。这样，他就会明白：有空气存在，空气有压力等等。
    不仅是科学实验，即使是一些简单的劳作，也可以增进孩子们对于各种物质性能的理解。如种花、种树、种菜、养鸡、养兔、除四害、折纸船、做滑翔机、洗衣服……等等。这是举不胜举的。通过这些劳作，孩子们就会明白，许多浅近的科学道理，他们会在轻微的劳动中得到不少的感性认识，
    当然，仅仅是依据孩子们自己的观察、实验和劳作，那是远远不够的，还要诱导孩子阅读通俗生动的书籍。书籍能开启孩子们的视野，会把整个迷人的世界揭开给他看，会燃起他探索自然、改造自然的热烈愿望。
    帮助孩子们认识自然界，这件事虽不那么容易，但也不是无法下手的事。我们只要教会孩子按照外形去识别常见的动物、植物、矿物，了解它们互相间的关系，它们的主要性质以及人类怎样利用它们就行了。
    这是初级阶段，然而，这是一个极有意义的开端。
