Establish a Battle Line, Universally Mobilize, Grasp the Two Ends, Fix Management
An'guo's Third-Class Wheat Will Disappear

    (Our dispatch) An'guo County, Hebei Province, has achieved great success in strengthening wheat field management through methods such as establishing a battle line, universally mobilizing, grasping the two ends.

    Up to now, all of the county's more than 170,000 mu of wheat fields have been harrowed more than three times, and topdressed, watered, and cultivated more than twice in a timely manner. According to a recent inspection by the An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, first-class wheat fields have increased from 60,000 mu at the end of February to 86,000 mu, second-class wheat fields have decreased by 13,000 mu, and third-class wheat fields with yellow, weak, and sparse seedlings have also decreased from 35,000 mu to 14,000 mu. The remaining third-class wheat fields can all be improved by the beginning of May.

    The An'guo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mainly adopted the following measures for wheat management: First, establish a dedicated battle line to strengthen leadership in wheat field management. Before the wheat began to turn green, the county, township, and commune Party organizations in An'guo County each selected a secretary who, together with relevant departments, formed a three-level county, township, and commune wheat management battle line responsible for leading wheat field management. After implementing this method, secretaries at all three levels were present in the wheat fields every day, thus being able to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Second, conduct a mass debate to break down ideological obstacles and strengthen confidence in increasing production. In the early stages of wheat field management, some cadres and commune members in the county lacked confidence in high yields above 500 jin and in increasing production in inferior wheat fields, especially the latter. In view of this, the county committee led all townships and communes in the county to conduct in-depth discussions among cadres and commune members on several major ideological issues, such as whether high yields could be achieved, whether good and bad wheat fields could universally increase production, and how to ensure increased wheat production. During the discussions, the townships and communes were consciously guided to summarize local high-yield models, set examples, and mobilize commune members to contribute production increase plans and find production increase conditions, creating a mass wheat production increase debate. After this discussion, the masses in each commune, based on different local conditions, identified dozens of production increase methods, such as covering sandy soil with black sticky soil fertilizer and processing and adding fertilizer, skillful hoeing and fine irrigation, which increased their confidence in increasing production. Third, earnestly grasp high yields, grasp inferior wheat, and universally strengthen management. During the first topdressing and watering, the county, based on different conditions, led the agricultural cooperatives to apply more than 700,000 jin of chemical fertilizer to more than 60,000 mu of high-yield wheat with good soil quality and sufficient water sources. Fertilization and replanting were carried out on wheat fields with few and weak seedlings, achieving different management for different types, which also had a great effect on the changes in wheat seedlings throughout the county. Fourth, establish wheat management teams. More than 20,000 commune members with rich wheat planting experience were fixed to manage wheat fields throughout the county, which was also of great benefit to strengthening wheat field management. In terms of labor organization, An'guo County also implemented the method of fixing time, tasks, quality, and remuneration for wheat field management teams, combined with inspections and awards, and implemented a responsibility system, which also achieved good results.

    An'guo County is one of the major wheat-producing counties in Hebei Province. The masses have relatively high wheat field management techniques. In March, the Central Ministry of Agriculture held a wheat field management meeting in the county, organizing cadres from eight provinces to visit the county, which further encouraged the enthusiasm and passion of the county's cadres and masses for wheat field management.

### 建立战线  普遍动员  抓紧两头  固定管理  安国三类麦将绝迹

    建立战线  普遍动员  抓紧两头  固定管理
    安国三类麦将绝迹
    本报讯　河北省安国县用一条战线、普遍动员、抓紧两头等办法，加强麦田管理，已获得很大成绩。
    截至目前止，全县十七万多亩小麦，及时进行了三次以上的压耙，两次以上的追肥、浇水和中耕。根据中共安国县委最近的检查，第一类麦田已由2月底时的六万亩增到八万六千亩，二类麦减少了一万三千亩，苗子黄弱稀疏的三类麦也由三万五千亩减少到一万四千亩。5月初就可以使剩下的三类麦田全部改观。
    中共安国县委对小麦管理，主要采取了以下几项措施。一、建立一条专门战线，加强麦田管理的领导。在小麦开始返青前，安国县县、乡、社党组织分别抽出了一个书记，协同有关部门组成了县、乡、社三级小麦管理战线，专责领导麦田管理工作。实行这个办法后，三级书记每天都有人在麦田现场，因而能及时发现和解决问题。二、全民辩论打破思想障碍，坚定增产信心。麦田管理初期，这县曾有一部分干部社员对五百斤以上的高额丰产和次麦田增产信心不足，特别是对次麦更不起劲。据此，县委领导全县各乡社对丰产能不能实现、好坏麦田能不能普遍增产、怎样保证麦田增产等几个主要思想问题，发动干部社员进行了深刻的讨论。在讨论中并有意识的让各乡社总结当地已有的丰产典型，摆样子，发动社员献增产计划找增产条件，造成群众性的小麦增产辩论。经过这次讨论，各社群众根据当地不同情况，曾找出了黑粘土盖沙肥和加工加肥，巧锄细灌等几十种增产办法，增加了增产信心。三、切实抓丰产、抓次麦、普遍加强管理。这县在第一次追肥浇水时，曾根据不同情况，领导农业社对六万多亩土质好水源足的丰产麦，增施了七十多万斤化肥。对苗少苗弱的麦田进行了加肥和栽补，作到了不同类型不同的管理，这对全县麦苗变化也有很大作用。四、建立小麦管理组。全县固定了两万多名富有种麦经验的社员管理麦田，对加强麦田管理也有很大好处。在劳力组织上，安国县还对麦田管理组实行了麦田管理定时间、定任务、定质量、定报酬的办法，结合检查评奖，实行责任制，也收到很好的效果。
    安国县是河北省主要产麦县之一。群众管理麦田的技术较高。3月间中央农业部曾在这县召开麦田管理会议，组织八个省的干部在这县参观，更鼓舞了这县干部群众麦田管理的干劲和热情。
