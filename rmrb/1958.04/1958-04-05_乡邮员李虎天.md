    Rural Postman Li Hutian
    By Our Correspondent Ye Jianyun
    Li Hutian is a 25-year-old Korean youth. He has been working at the Badaohezi Postal and Telecommunications Branch Bureau in the Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture for five years. Before I met this young man, I found some materials about him in the files of the leading organs. It was written as follows:
    During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, Comrade Li Hutian traveled 127,000 li; delivered 190,000 copies of newspapers and magazines; and collected and delivered more than 68,000 parcels, money orders, and letters. He has not made a mistake for five consecutive years. Even the winter snow, the severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius, and the summer floods did not delay his shift once. In addition, he organized 50 reading groups and developed nearly 2,000 new subscribers to newspapers and magazines...
    Li Hutian, this is an energetic young man. When I interviewed him, he raised a series of hypothetical questions to me.
    "If the entire region develops from the current average of one newspaper or magazine per twelve people to one per nine people, will it work?"
    "Currently, it takes more than twelve hours for mail to reach the recipient from the branch bureau. Can it be shortened to less than ten hours, say, eight hours?"
    These are bold assumptions. The Badaohezi Postal and Telecommunications Branch Bureau manages three townships and one town, and there is only one rural postman. His daily work is to run to the three townships of Dexin, Huajian, and Nanyang; the distance between these three townships is 90 li for a round trip. This route is calculated based on the mail being delivered to the township government.
    "However, on average, only 20% of the mail each year is for the township people's committee and those stationed in the village, and the remaining 80% requires the recipients to pick it up in the township. Can all the mail and newspapers be delivered directly to the recipients?"
    That's why it's a bold assumption, because to do so, the daily route would have to be extended to 130 li. This is a mountainous area, with no trains or cars available, and even bicycles are useless. All transportation depends on two legs. It is already tight for one person to run 90 li back and forth from early to late, and now to extend the route by 40 li, there are naturally many difficulties.
    "Some things seem very difficult, but if you do them seriously, things that seem impossible may be possible."
    Speaking of this, Li Hutian introduced the following experience.
    In August 1954, several heavy rains fell in Yanbian Prefecture, and mountain floods broke out. Villages were washed away here, and several people were washed away there. These terrible news circulated in Badaohezi Town like alarms. Early in the morning, before dawn, the director rushed to the dormitory and said to Li Hutian:
    "Xiao Li, the postal route situation is unclear today, so we have decided not to dispatch."
    When it dawned, Li Hutian jumped up from the bed and went to the door. It was still raining heavily. The flood in the low-lying area was much higher than yesterday; rainwater poured down from the mountains, and the mountains and valleys were roaring.
    He went into the post office office. The mailbags were already full. He held the mailbags in both hands, standing there thinking.
    "Should I dispatch? There are nine big rivers ahead, the currents are rapid and the waves are big, how can I cross them? If I don't dispatch, how many people are thinking about this big package of mail! Besides, if it doesn't stop raining today and the water doesn't recede tomorrow, if it's delayed for a few days, won't people be anxious..."
    Finally, he slung the mailbag over his shoulder and rushed to the director.
    "Director, I've thought it over, I need to dispatch today. If the water is high and there are difficulties, we can think of ways to overcome them."
    The director looked at the young man's purple and red face, rubbing his hands back and forth, mechanically repeating:
    "Yes, we need to dispatch."
    After a pause, he said cautiously and decisively:
    "Xiao Li, give it a try. However, I have to give you a rule, if you can't get through, turn back, you're not allowed to force it."
    When he set off, the rain was lighter. The people at home were happy for Xiao Li. About an hour later, the sky suddenly darkened, followed by a rainstorm. The fierce storm was accompanied by torrential rain, crops were flattened, and tree branches were broken.
    The director watched the dark sky, feeling very regretful. He picked up the telephone and tried to contact everywhere. Some places couldn't be reached because the telephone lines were broken, and some places replied: they didn't see Li Hutian's shadow at all.
    "Really confused, why did I allow him to dispatch in this weather!" The director frowned helplessly, blaming himself.
    "This young man, either don't let him go out, once he goes out, even if he encounters great difficulties, it's impossible to make him turn back."
    Li Hutian waded through two rivers and climbed a small bald ridge, and found that he had only cared about crossing the river and had not been careful enough and got the mailbag wet. Fortunately, the mail inside was not affected. To be on the safe side, he took off his raincoat and wrapped the mailbag tightly. Then, he put this cumbersome package on his neck. After preparing, he was about to go down the mountain to wade through the third river, but before he could take a step, the rainstorm came.
    Below the mountain was a low-lying area more than a li wide. The usual water and grassland area was now a vast expanse of water, with waves rolling in with the storm.
    "Wade across the low-lying area, or detour? If I wade, I don't know how deep it is, and it's so wide, who can I call for help if something goes wrong? But if I detour, I'm not familiar with the terrain here..."
    At this time, he was not allowed to continue thinking. The strong wind and rain not only made it difficult for him to open his eyes, but even breathing was difficult. In a moment of desperation, he untied the towel around his neck, wrung out the rainwater, tore it in half, wrapped one layer around the wound, and tied another layer tightly.
    All these actions were done sitting on the ground. When he wrapped the wound and stood up from the ground, the injured leg could not be straightened no matter what. A sharp pain made him clench his teeth tightly. So he sat down again, facing the rolling flood, almost bursting into tears.
    His thoughts were chaotic, to be honest, he was a little discouraged.
    "Go back! Or find a village nearby to rest!"
    But another thought flashed in his mind:
    "How can this be, I'm carrying the hopes of so many people on my shoulders. Pain, cold, what do they count for! When I was young, our family of eight shared a pair of ragged cotton pants, and my eldest brother wore them up the mountain to chop firewood, and the whole family often huddled on the kang and couldn't go out. Now I'm suffering so little, and I want to retreat..."
    Thinking and thinking, he spat fiercely, not knowing where the strength came from, jumped up from the ground, and rushed to the bridgehead.
    After crossing the bridge, not far away, there was a village. As soon as he entered the village, an old man wearing a raincoat waved to him. He realized that he had arrived at Shimen Village.
    "It's strange, how did I get here so quickly!"
    The old man smiled and said to him:
    "You're lucky to have taken the right path today! Never mind that, come into the house, light some firewood, and warm yourself up first."
    Li Hutian sat next to the warm fire and said to himself:
    "First to the township, then to the village, this detour is quite a bit. If I take this route in the future, from the village to the township, I can save at least dozens of li..."
    That night, Li Hutian returned to Badaohezi. As he approached the post office, he heard a noisy commotion inside. The director's voice was the loudest, shouting as if he was angry with someone:
    "Find him, we must find him, if we can't find him alive, we have to bring back his body."
    Then there were other voices. At this time, Li Hutian stepped into the gate and quietly asked:
    "What happened, why are you in such a hurry?"
    His appearance stunned everyone in the room.
    "Oh, you little fellow," the director was the first to come over, took the mailbag from his shoulder, and then continued, "You're really a newborn calf not afraid of tigers, you scared everyone into a sweat. Life is at stake, it's not a joke."
    Li Hutian understood everything, but didn't know what to say, staring at the others and laughing. Then he turned to the director and said:
    "Although it was dangerous, I discovered a big problem today."
    So, he explained his plan to shorten the route, deliver mail directly to households, and prepare to climb several high mountains to start drawing an economic postal route map of the postal area.
    "Let's not talk about that, get some rest. In any case, you're not allowed to do this in the future." The director admonished him in the tone of an elder.
    A few days later, Li Hutian borrowed a broken telescope and, using his spare time, selected several higher mountain tops and, with the help of other comrades in the bureau, created 20 Yanji County Dexin District Township postal route maps. According to the route he selected, the postal route for the entire district could be shortened by 40%. As a result, newspapers and letters that used to be received after two days can now be received on the same day.

### 乡邮员李虎天

专栏：

    乡邮员李虎天
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    李虎天今年二十五岁，是朝鲜族的一个青年。他在延边自治区八道河子邮电支局工作已经五年了。我在认识这个年青人以前，曾在领导机关的卷宗堆里翻到一份有关他的材料。上面是这么写的：
    第一个五年计划期间，李虎天同志走了十二万七千里路程；投递了十九万份报刊；收投了六万八千多件包裹、汇票和信件。连续五年没出过差错。即使冬天的风雪，零下四十度的严寒，夏天没顶的洪水，也没有使他误过一次班期。此外，他还组织了五十个读报组，发展了近两千份报刊的新订户……
    李虎天，这是个精力充沛的青年人。我访问他的时候，他向我提出了一系列假设的问题。
    “如果全区从目前的平均十二个人一份报刊，发展到九个人一份成不成哩？”
    “目前邮件从支局到收件人手里，需要十二个小时以上，能不能缩短到十个小时以内，譬如八个小时哩？”
    这是大胆的假设。八道河子邮电支局所经管的范围是三乡一镇，乡邮员只有一个人。他每天的工作，就是跑德新、铧尖、南阳三个乡；这三个乡之间的距离算来回是九十里。这条线路是以邮件送到乡政府计算的。
    “可是，每年的邮件，平均只有20％是乡人民委员会和驻在村的，其余80％需要收件人到乡里来取。能不能把所有的邮件、报刊直接送到收件人手里哩？”
    所以说这是大胆的假设，因为要这样做的话，每天的线路要延长到一百三十里。这里是山区，既无火车汽车可乘，即使自行车也使不上，来往交通全靠两条腿。一个人早出晚归跑九十里来回，已经是够紧的了，现在要延长四十里的线路，困难当然不少。
    “有些事情看起来困难很多，如果认真地做起来，办不到的事情也可能办到了。”
    谈到这里，李虎天介绍了如下的一段经历。
    1954年8月间，延边地区接连下了几场大雨，山洪暴发了。这里的村庄被冲垮，那里冲走了几个人。这些可怕的消息，像警报一样，在八道河子镇上流传着。清晨，天麻麻亮，局长就赶到宿舍里对李虎天说：
    “小李，今天邮路情况不明，决定不出班。”
    天明了，李虎天一骨碌从铺上跳了起来，走到门前一看，大雨依旧下个不停。甸子里的洪水，比昨天又涨了许多；雨水从山上奔流直泻，满山满谷一片轰鸣。
    他走进邮局办公室，邮包已经装得满满的。两手扶着邮包，呆在那里想心思。
    “出班吧，前面要过九条大河，流急浪大，怎么过法？不出班吧，这一大包邮件，有多少人在念着它啊！何况今天雨不停，明天水不退，一拖几天，这不叫人家心焦煞了……
    最后，他挎上邮包，一口气冲到局长面前。
    “局长，我想过了，今天需要出班。水大，有困难，可以想办法克服。”
    局长瞅着这个年青人又紫又红的面孔，来回地搓着双手，机械地重复着：
    “是呀，我们需要出班。”
    停了一停，又慎重又果断地说：
    “小李，试一试瞧。不过，得给你一条规定，过不去就回头走，可不许勉强。”
    出发的时候，雨小了一些。家里的人都为小李高兴。大约一个钟头以后，天空突然一阵黑，紧接着暴风雨就来了。凶猛的风暴伴着倾盆大雨，庄稼倒伏了，树枝也吹断了。
    局长注视着黑压压的天空，心里十分后悔。拿起电话机来到处联系。有的地方因为电话线刮断了挂不通，有的地方回说：根本就没瞧见李虎天的影子。
    “真糊涂，为什么这样的天气允许他出班呢！”局长无可奈何地拧着眉头在责怪自己。
    “这个青年人，要末不放他出去，出去了，碰上天大的困难，想让他回头走，是办不到的。”
    李虎天趟过了两条河，爬上了一座小秃岭，发觉刚才只顾过河，不留心把邮包沾湿了。幸好，里面的邮件并没有受到影响。为了万无一失，他脱下了雨衣，把邮包严严实实地包扎了一番。随后，就把这个累赘的包裹架在自己的脖子上。整装以后，正准备下山去趟第三条河，还没来得及迈步，暴风雨就来了。
    山下是一里多宽的甸子，平时的水草地带，现在是一片汪洋，随着狂风暴雨的来临，甸子里浪涛滚滚。
    “趟过甸子去，还是绕道而行？趟水吧，不知深浅，这么宽，出了问题向谁呼救。可是绕道哩，这里的地形又不熟悉……
    这时，不允许他继续想下去了。原来大风大雨把他浇得不仅眼睛睁不开，连呼吸也感到困难了。情急生智，他把那条围在脖子上的毛巾解开来，用它在头上扎了一道箍，把绪头留在后面，好让雨水沿着绪头从背梁上流下去。
    风越刮越猛，雨是小一些了。他身上感到一阵冷，随后满身一皱起了鸡皮疙瘩。唉！下起冰雹来啦。他瞧着地上一蹦老高的冰珠子，不禁打了个寒噤。回顾身上穿的单褂裤，雨水顺着折缝，一道道地往下流。想伸手拧一拧，两只手颤抖得捉不住。接着混身都颤抖起来了。只有脸上，豆子般的冰珠扑打过来，感到一阵火辣辣的疼痛。这时，如果再不走的话，真会冻死在这里。
    “走，绕着道儿走。天是空的，路是通的，不信就绕不过这道甸子。”
    翻过三、四道岭以后，冰雹不下了。雨依旧淅淅沥沥，风势仍然很大。抬头一看，前面是一座高山挡住了去路。为难了一阵，突然他又高兴起来。
    “这下可把我提醒了。俗话说，站得高看得远，为什么不冲上山去瞧一瞧这一带的地形哩？”
    于是，他爬上了这座高山。站在山巅，举目张望，山下虽是雨雾蒙蒙，水汽腾腾，周围的高低形势、羊肠曲径，仍然隐约可见。在山的右侧，有一条弯弯扭扭的河流。他发觉河上好像还有一道桥。他怀着满腔的希望，急忙下得山来，直奔这个去处。
    又是翻山越岭，终于来到了他所注视的地方。李虎天心上乐得什么似的。正准备过桥，猛地，脚底板像锥子一样刺痛了一下。低头一看，地下流的一滩血，很快就给雨水冲散了。这时他才发觉自己的鞋底不知在什么时候已经跑穿。仔细一检查，原来地上有块寸多高的玻璃碎片戳在脚掌心上，刺得很深，血流不止。他迅速解开了头上扎的毛巾，使劲拧干了雨水，一撕两半，把伤口裹了一层，又紧紧地扎了一道。
    这一切动作都是坐在地上作的。当他裹好创口，从地上站立起来的时候，那条受伤的腿怎么着也伸不直。一阵剧烈的疼痛，直使他紧紧地咬着牙。于是他又坐了下去，面对着滚滚的洪水，几乎要掉下泪来。
    他的心绪很乱，说实话，真有点灰心了。
    “退回去吧！或是就近找一个村子歇下来吧！”
    可是，他脑子里又闪着另一个念头：
    “这怎么成呢，我肩上背着多少人的希望。痛、冷，算得了什么！年幼的时候，全家八口人合着穿一条破棉裤，大哥穿着上山去砍柴，一家子常常挤在炕上出不了门。现在受这么一点苦，就想后退……
    想着想着，他狠狠地吐了一口唾沫，不知那来的这股子劲，从地上跳了起来，一下就冲到桥头。
    过了桥，走不多远，迎面就是一个村子。刚进村头，一个披着蓑衣的老汉在向他招手。一看才知道已经到了石门村。
    “真怪，怎么一下就到了你们这里！”
    老汉笑眯眯地对他说：
    “今天你算走对啦！别管这些吧，进屋来，点着柴禾，先烤一烤。”
    李虎天坐在暖热的火堆旁边，自言自语地说：
    “先到乡，后下村，这个弯子绕的可不小。今后如果走这条路线，从村里到乡里，起码可以少走几十里……
    当天深夜，李虎天回到八道河子了。走近邮局门口，只听得局子里乱噪噪的。局长的嗓门最高，像在跟谁发脾气似的直嚷嚷：
    “找，一定要找到，找不着活的，尸首也要弄回来。”
    接着又是别人的声音。这时，李虎天跨进了大门，轻悄悄地问道：
    “出了什么事，这么个急法？”
    他这一出现，可把满屋子的人弄呆了。
    “哎呀，你这个小家伙，”局长首先走过来，接下了他肩上的邮包，然后继续说，“真是初生的犊子不怕虎，可把大家吓出了一身汗。性命交关，可不是闹着玩的。”
    李虎天一看，明白了一切，可是不知道说什么才好，瞪着两只眼睛，看着其他人直发笑。接着他又转过脸来对局长说：
    “险虽险，今天却给我发现了一个大问题。”
    于是，他把怎样缩短线路、邮件直接到户，并且准备爬上几座高山，着手绘制本邮区经济邮线图的打算说了一遍。
    “先别谈这些吧，好好休息休息。无论如何，今后可不许这样干了。”局长用长辈的口吻，把他教训了几句。
    几天后，李虎天借到了一架破望远镜，利用业余时间，选择了几座较高的山头，在局里其他同志的帮助下，制成了二十幅延吉县德新区乡邮路线图。按照他所选择的线路，全区邮程可以缩短40％。这一来，过去两天后才能收到的报纸和信件，现在当天就可以收到了。
                          （未完）
