    Changjiang Brand Trucks and Jeeps
    The "Changjiang Brand" Model 26 medium-sized truck, jointly designed by Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory and Nanjing Chenguang Machinery Factory, was successfully trial-produced on the 3rd.
    The "Changjiang Brand" Model 26 truck is designed to meet the needs of short-distance transportation in urban and rural areas. This truck not only has high horsepower and high speed, but also has a small turning radius and a low center of gravity, so it starts very quickly.
    The first Changjiang Brand Model 46 Jeep appeared on the streets of Chongqing on the afternoon of the 5th. This car was comprehensively designed by Chongqing Wangjiang Machinery Factory and Chang'an Machinery Factory with reference to four types of jeeps from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries.
    The Changjiang Brand Model 46 Jeep has high horsepower (75 horsepower), a light body, a small engine, and low fuel consumption. Its maximum speed can reach 120 kilometers per hour when fully loaded. It has strong off-road capability and can rush through hilly areas, depressions, terraced wilderness without roads, and steep slopes of 45 degrees.

    长江牌的载重汽车和吉普车
    重庆建设机床厂和南京晨光机器厂联合设计的中型载重汽车——“长江牌”26型卡车，在3日试制成功。
    “长江牌”26型汽车是适应城市、乡村短途运输的需要而设计的。这种汽车不仅马力大，转速高，而且转向半径小，重心低，因此起动非常快。
    第一辆长江牌46型吉普车，5日下午在重庆街头出现。这辆汽车是重庆望江机器厂和长安机器厂参考苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等国家的四种吉普车综合设计出来的。
    长江牌46型吉普车马力大（七十五匹），车身轻，引擎小，耗油量少，满载时最大速度每小时达到一百二十公里。它越野能力强，在丘陵地、洼地、无公路的梯形荒野及四十五度的陡坡，都可一冲而过。
