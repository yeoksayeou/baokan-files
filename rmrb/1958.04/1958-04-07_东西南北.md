　　Plant Fertilizer Trees

　　Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture have pioneered the large-scale cultivation of fertilizer forests in the mountains. The fertilizer forests cultivated by the farmers consist of three types: "Tu Nai," "Tu Gao Ru" (both Miao languages), and "Lazy Fence" (Chinese). These fertilizer trees are all clump-forming shrubs with thick, dark green leaves that are especially high in fertilizer content. In the past, farmers of all ethnic groups applied it to paddy fields, turning the water and mud a dark black color, generally increasing rice production by about 30% per mu. These fertilizer trees can be harvested for fertilizer in one year, and after growing for two to three years, each clump can produce two to three dan of fertilizer.

　　Baoshan Also Has Medicinal Corn

　　Some farmers in Baoshan County, Yunnan Province, also have the habit of sporadically growing medicinal corn. This crop can be harvested continuously for four to five years after a single planting in the area, and in hotter regions such as along the Lancang River, it can be harvested three times a year. This corn is mainly used for medicinal purposes locally, and some farmers even use it as a gift for women who have just given birth.

　　Increase Planting of Qingzhou Silver Melon

　　The famous Qingzhou Silver Melon, known for being both tender and sweet, is being planted in large quantities this year in the Hongguang Cooperative in Yidu, Shandong. The cooperative planted more than 30,000 furrows last year, but they were destroyed by river water due to late cultivation. This year, they will cultivate more than 75,000 furrows. To learn from last year's lessons, they are adopting methods such as early nursery beds, early cultivation, and strengthened technical guidance. Currently, the cooperative has prepared the nursery beds, dug the ditches, and replaced the soil, and will soon be transplanting.

    种肥料树
    湘西土家族、苗族自治州各族农民首创在山野里大面积营造肥料林。各族农民营造的肥料林有“图耐”、“图高茹”（苗语）和“懒篱笆”（汉语）三种。这些肥料树都是丛生灌木，它的叶厚而深绿，是肥丛特高部分。过去，各族农民曾把它施放在稻田里，水、泥均呈污黑色，一般每亩增产稻谷30％左右。这些肥料树一年就能采肥，长到两三年后，每兜可产肥二至三担。
    保山也有药玉米
    云南保山县一些农户也有零星种植药玉米的习惯。这种作物在当地播种一次可以连续收获四、五年，在澜沧江边等较热地区一年可收获三次。这种玉米在当地主要是药用，有的农民还拿它作为对产妇赠送的礼品。
    增种青州银瓜
    以既嫩又甜著名的青州银瓜，今年在山东益都红光社大量种植。该社去年种植的三万余埯，由于栽培过迟，被河水冲坏。今年他们将栽培七万五千余埯，为接受去年教训，采取早畦芽、早栽培、加强技术指导等办法。目前该社已畦好芽，挖好沟，换上土，不久即要定植。
