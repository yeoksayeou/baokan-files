A Correction to the New Edition of "Complete Works of Lu Xun"

Recently, I saw two pages of the manuscript of Mr. Lu Xun's article "Heaven and Earth." This article is included in Mr. Lu Xun's "Pseudo-Free Book."

"Pseudo-Free Book" is a collection of Mr. Lu Xun's essays published in "Free Talk" in Shen Bao from the end of January to mid-May 1933. During this period, Mr. Lu Xun's old pen name was sometimes unavailable, so he changed it to He Jiagan, and sometimes used Ding Meng. The signature on the manuscript of "Heaven and Earth" is "He Jiagan," and it was published in "Free Talk" with only the character "Gan."

The publication date of "Heaven and Earth" was May 19, 1933.

In the first edition of "Pseudo-Free Book" published by Shanghai Qingguang Bookstore in 1933, Mr. Lu Xun wrote the following at the end of "Heaven and Earth":

"Going abroad for recuperation, growing sores on the back, worshipping Buddha on famous mountains, having sugar in the urine, this is the end." Nineteenth Night Postscript

Now, examining the manuscript, the sentences are indeed like this. Checking the Shen Bao of May 19, 1933, "Free Talk" published only three sentences at the end of "Heaven and Earth": "Going abroad for recuperation, worshipping Buddha on famous mountains, this is the end." The two sentences "growing sores on the back" and "having sugar in the urine" were missing. These two sentences refer to Wang Jingwei, who had sores on his back in 1933 and claimed to have diabetes due to internal strife, using it as an excuse to resign and go abroad for recuperation.

Mr. Lu Xun wrote in the preface to "Quasi-Wind and Moon Talk": "Japanese publications also have taboos, but the deleted parts are left blank or added with dotted lines so that readers can know. Chinese censors do not allow blank spaces to be left, they must be connected, so readers cannot see the traces of censorship and deletion, and all the ambiguity and vagueness are attributed to the author."

Now, seeing Mr. Lu Xun's manuscript of "Heaven and Earth," it has suffered such a fate. In the fifth paragraph, "This is also two good articles made on the topic of 'No pacification, no resistance to foreign aggression' or 'Pacification is more urgent than resisting foreign aggression'," a large section was also deleted after this paragraph. The original text is:

Buying airplanes. Will be used to "pacify;" digging tunnels, "cannot resist foreign aggression." Because "pacification is more urgent than resisting foreign aggression," it is still necessary to buy airplanes, and "no pacification, no resistance to foreign aggression," so tunnels must be dug.

A total of forty-four characters. With these sentences, the meaning of the article becomes much clearer. From here, Mr. Lu Xun's opposition to the civil war, his advocacy of resistance against Japan, his sympathy for the Chinese Communist Party, and his hatred for the Kuomintang can all be fully seen. The above paragraph was not added in the "Pseudo-Free Book" in the fifth volume of the "Complete Works of Lu Xun" published by People's Literature Publishing House last year, and there was no mention of it in the annotations.

### 新版“鲁迅全集”的一个补正

    新版“鲁迅全集”的一个补正
    最近看到鲁迅先生的“天上地下”一文的两页手稿。这篇文章收在鲁迅先生的“伪自由书”中。
    “伪自由书”是鲁迅先生1933年1月底至5月中旬为止，在申报“自由谈”发表的杂感的汇集。在这一时期，鲁迅先生旧日的笔名有时不能通用，便改用了何家干。有时用丁萌。“天上地下”的手稿上面的署名是“何家干”，在“自由谈”上发表时是一个“干”字。
    “天上地下”一文发表时间是1933年5月19日。
    在1933年上海青光书局初版的“伪自由书”，鲁迅先生在“天上地下”一文文末这样写着：
    “外洋养病，背脊生疮，名山上拜佛，小便里有糖，这就完结了。”	十九夜补记
    现在检阅手稿，文句确是如此。查1933年5月19日的申报，“自由谈”刊登“天上地下”一文末尾只有三句，是“外洋养病，名山拜佛，这就完结了。”少了“背脊生疮”、“小便有糖”两句。这两句是指汪精卫在1933年生了背疮，因内哄又自称有糖尿病，借口下野出国养病。
    鲁迅先生在“准风月谈”前记中写道：“日本的刊物，也有禁忌，但被删之处，是留着空白，或加虚线，使读者能够知道的。中国的检查官却不许留空白，必须接起来，于是读者就看不见检查删削的痕迹，一切含胡和恍忽之点，都归在作者身上了。”
    现在看到鲁迅先生“天上地下”的手稿，正是遭到这样的命运。在第五段“这也是对于‘非安内无以攘外’或‘安内急于攘外’的题目，做出来的两股好文章。”这段的后面还被删去一大段，原文是：
    买飞机。将以“安内”也，挖地洞，“无以攘外”也。因为“安内急于攘外”，故还须买飞机，而“非安内无以攘外”，故必得挖地洞。
    计四十四字。有了这几句，文章的意义就明确得多。从这里对先生反对内战，主张抗战的见解；对于中国共产党的同情，对国民党的愤恨也就完全可以看出来了。上面这一段，在去年人民文学出版社出版的“鲁迅全集”第五卷“伪自由书”的该文中没有补上，注释中也没有提到。（于枚）
