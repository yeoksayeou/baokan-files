On the evening of March 27th, Chairman Mao Zedong arrived by train at Longchang Station in the central Sichuan Basin.

The Sichuan Basin, rich in natural gas reserves, is one of the largest gas fields in the world. Chairman Mao came here to inspect the Longchang Gas Mine, China's first to use natural gas to produce carbon black (a raw material for rubber).

It was more than twenty li from the station to the gas mine. It was already past six o'clock in the afternoon, and it was raining. No transportation had been prepared in advance, so people temporarily found a car for Chairman Mao. After traveling along the undulating road, Chairman Mao arrived at the gas mine.

The workers of the Longchang Gas Mine had not expected Chairman Mao's arrival. Accompanied by Li Jingquan, First Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao walked up a high slope and entered the gas mine's guest house. Wang Dafen, a female worker, and Xie Fengxia and Lin Guonong, staff members, were the first to recognize Chairman Mao and quickly ran to the guest house, where Chairman Mao warmly shook hands with them one by one.

At this time, Liu Xuanwu, the mine director, and An Zengbin, the Party Secretary, arrived. Chairman Mao did not rest, but got up and went to visit the carbon black workshop two li away.

Liu Xuanwu and Chairman Mao sat in the same car. On the way, Chairman Mao asked Liu Xuanwu about the composition of natural gas and the related uses of natural gas. When Chairman Mao heard Liu Xuanwu say that the Longchang Gas Mine was experimenting with using natural gas to produce synthetic gasoline, he was very interested and asked Liu Xuanwu, "What components need to be removed to make synthetic gasoline from methane (natural gas)?" Liu Xuanwu said that mainly hydrogen sulfide and nitrogen and other components are removed. Chairman Mao nodded with satisfaction.

The car climbed the slope along the winding road, with substations, machine repair shops, warehouses and other buildings flashing past on both sides. After arriving at the destination, Chairman Mao walked towards the workshop, and bursts of strong wind, carrying smoke billowing from the workshop, blew in his face.

The workers on duty suddenly saw Chairman Mao and were so excited that they didn't know what to say, they just stared at Chairman Mao in a daze. They saw that Chairman Mao was radiant and full of energy, and they felt indescribably happy in their hearts.

Chairman Mao listened to Liang Xiyuan, the deputy director of the workshop, introducing the production operation process. When he heard that the hydrogen sulfide in the natural gas was removed through a desulfurization tower, Chairman Mao asked with concern, "Where does the desulfurized hydrogen sulfide go?" Liang Xiyuan and An Zengbin replied that the hydrogen sulfide was discharged from the regeneration tower and disappeared into the air. It could have been recovered as sulfur, but it hasn't been utilized yet.

Chairman Mao walked to the front of the furnace where carbon black is produced. Liang Xiyuan opened a small door of furnace No. 1, and Chairman Mao bent down to observe the burning situation inside the furnace. Because the wind was strong, he couldn't see clearly. Liang Xiyuan accompanied Chairman Mao to the last small door of furnace No. 21, where it was sheltered from the wind, and he could clearly see the hundreds of densely arranged gas pipes with nozzles, spraying yellow-red flames, with the carbon black accumulating on the slowly moving steel plate "trough iron" above the flames.

Chairman Mao smiled happily when he saw it. This was outdoors, and Chairman Mao, disregarding the wind and rain, simply squatted down and observed with rapt attention. As he watched, he carefully asked about the arrangement of the natural gas pipes.

Chairman Mao noticed that the trough iron did not seem to be moving back and forth as Liang Xiyuan had said, so he asked: "Why didn't I see the trough iron moving?" Liang Xiyuan explained that the trough iron moved very slowly, and it was not easy to see. Chairman Mao faced such an unfamiliar thing, watched so carefully, and asked so clearly, which made everyone very moved.

Chairman Mao asked about the annual output of the gas mine. Liang Xiyuan replied that the mine's output was now more than five times higher than when it was first built. The output figure he cited accounted for about a quarter of the total national carbon black industry output.

Chairman Mao had been squatting all along, and at this point he stood up and asked Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who came with him, "Have you seen it? What do you think?" Ke Qingshi said, "I saw it. In Ziliujing (that is, Zigong City), the thermal energy of natural gas is used to burn salt, but the thermal energy here has not been utilized."

Chairman Mao said: "In Ziliujing, natural gas is used to burn salt, and the carbon black is lost."

Chairman Mao was truly like a skilled expert, immediately pointing out an important issue in the utilization of natural gas. People felt that Chairman Mao was so concerned about every step of development and every achievement in the development of natural gas.

It was past seven o'clock, the sky was already dark, the wind was blowing harder, and the rain was falling harder. Chairman Mao's clothes and hat were already wet, and he still wanted to see the gas wells on the distant mountains. Considering Chairman Mao's health and the value of his time, Comrade Li Jingquan and Comrade Ke Qingshi both advised him to leave, and Chairman Mao agreed. As he walked, he asked An Zengbin: "Was this mine designed by foreign experts?" An Zengbin said: "It was designed by our Chinese experts." Chairman Mao also asked about the establishment of the gas mine, and An Zengbin and Liu Xuanwu reported to Chairman Mao. This gas mine was established in 1953 and has now developed from a small well before liberation to more than twenty wells. Liu Xuanwu also told Chairman Mao that they can now produce three kinds of carbon black, and this year they also plan to trial-produce a new product—high wear-resistant oil furnace black. Chairman Mao nodded and smiled and said, "Very good!"

Everyone sent Chairman Mao to the car, looking at the car leaving the gate of the gas mine with reluctance.

That night, Liang Xiyuan was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night. He remembered that before liberation, he was a worker in the salt factory that was the predecessor of this gas mine, and he was beaten and scolded by the capitalists and lived a life of starvation. After liberation, the Communist Party cultivated him into the deputy director of the gas mine workshop, and his family of nine had enough to eat and wear. All of this was inseparable from Chairman Mao's leadership. Today, he never dreamed that he would see the most beloved leader, and he also reported his work to the leader. This was truly the happiest thing in his life. He was determined to contribute everything to the carbon black industry. Many other people who saw Chairman Mao also talked about the scene at the time with great interest whenever they met someone; those who were far away and could not see Chairman Mao also listened to other people's descriptions again and again, sharing this common joy. Chairman Mao took the time out of his busy schedule to inspect the utilization of natural gas and to visit the workers of the gas mine, which moved them so much. Chairman Mao's hard-working and simple style, and his approachable and great image, made them feel unforgettable for life.

After Chairman Mao left, all the workers in the mine held oath-taking meetings, calling for redoubled efforts and striving for greater progress, and striving for a greater leap forward. They proposed to further improve the quality of various products. In addition to completing the national plan this year, they will also strive to increase the country's wealth by 10 million yuan. In recent days, the entire mine has been leaping forward with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping, and new records have been constantly appearing, and many key production problems have been solved one after another. In the carbon black workshop that Chairman Mao visited, the workers have continuously created two tools to solve key production problems, thoroughly overhauled the machines, and the carbon black output has increased by about 10% compared with before Chairman Mao came; the youth shock team of this mine has already used waste materials to build two new "Leap Forward" furnaces next to the furnace that Chairman Mao visited, and they can be put into production before May 1st.

    毛主席冒雨访隆昌气矿
    本报记者　邵挺军　于竞祁
    3月27日傍晚，毛泽东主席乘火车来到了四川盆地中部的隆昌车站。
    在富饶的四川盆地，天然气的储气构造分布很广，是世界上最大气田之一。毛主席是到这里来视察我国第一个利用天然气制造炭黑（橡胶原料）的隆昌气矿的。
    从车站到气矿还有二十多华里。这时已经是下午六点多，天下着雨，事先没有准备交通工具，人们临时为毛主席找了一辆小汽车。穿过起伏不平的公路，毛主席来到了气矿。
    隆昌气矿的职工们，谁也没有想到毛主席的到来。毛主席由中共四川省委第一书记李井泉陪同，走上一个高坡，进入气矿招待所。最先认出毛主席的女工王大芬、工作人员谢奉霞、林国浓，飞快地跑到了招待所，毛主席亲切地和他们一一握手。
    这时，矿长刘选伍、党委书记安增彬赶来了。毛主席没有休息，就起身到两里路外的槽黑车间去参观。
    刘选伍和毛主席坐在一个汽车里。在路上，毛主席向刘选伍询问着天然气的组成成分和有关利用天然气的情况。当毛主席听到刘选伍说隆昌气矿正在试验用天然气制造合成汽油时，很感兴趣，问刘选伍，瓦斯（天然气）制造合成汽油，要去掉那些成分？刘选伍说，主要去掉硫化氢和氮等成分。毛主席满意地点了点头。
    汽车顺着弯曲的公路爬坡，两旁闪过一幢幢配电所、机修厂、仓库等建筑物。到达目的地后，毛主席向车间走去，阵阵大风夹带着车间里飞散出来的烟雾迎面吹来。
    值班的工人突然看到毛主席，激动得不知说什么是好，只是出神地望着毛主席。他们看到毛主席红光满面，精神奕奕，心里头都有说不出的高兴。
    毛主席听着车间副主任梁锡远介绍生产操作过程。听到天然气中的硫化氢通过脱硫塔被脱出时，毛主席便关心地问：“脱出来的硫化氢到什么地方去了？”梁锡远和安增彬回答说，硫化氢从再生塔排出，随着空气跑掉了，本来可以收回硫磺，目前还没有利用起来。
    毛主席走到生成炭黑的火房前面。梁锡远打开一号火房的一个小门，毛主席弯下腰，观察火房里面的燃烧情况。因为风很大，看不清楚。梁锡远又陪毛主席转到最后的第二十一号火房小门前，这里背风，可以清楚地看到千百支密密排列着的气管上的火咀，喷射着黄红色的火焰，炭黑聚集在火焰上方的慢慢移动着的钢板“槽铁”上。
    毛主席看了高兴地笑起来。这是在露天，毛主席不顾风雨，索性蹲了下去，聚精会神地观察起来。他一边看，一边仔细地问着天然气管的装置情形。
    毛主席发现，槽铁似乎没有像梁锡远说的那样来回移动，便问：怎么没有看到槽铁走动？梁锡远解释说，槽铁移动得非常慢，不容易看出来。毛主席面对这样一个陌生的东西，看得这样仔细，问得这样清楚，使大家都很感动。
    毛主席问到这个气矿的年产量。梁锡远回答说，现在气矿的产量已经比初建矿时增加了五倍以上。他举出的产量数字，约占全国炭黑工业总产量的四分之一。
    毛主席一直蹲着，这时才站起身来，问一起来的中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施说：“你看到了没有。你认为怎么样？”柯庆施说：“看到了。自流井
  （即自贡市）是用天然气的热能烧盐，这里的热能没有利用起来。”
    毛主席说：“自流井的天然气烧盐，跑掉了炭黑。”
    毛主席真像一位熟练的专家，一下子就指出利用天然气中的一个重要问题。人们感到，毛主席是多么关心开发天然气中的每一步发展和每一个成就。
    时间已过七点，天已擦黑，风刮得更紧，雨也下得更大，毛主席的衣帽都已打湿，他还想去看在很远山上的产气井。照顾到主席的健康和时间的宝贵，李井泉同志和柯庆施同志都劝他走，毛主席同意了。他一边走一边问安增彬：“这个矿是不是外国专家设计的？”安增彬说：“是我们中国专家设计的。”毛主席还问到气矿建立的情形，安增彬和刘选伍向毛主席作了报告。这个气矿是1953年建立的，现在已经从解放前的一口小井，发展到二十多口井。刘选伍还告诉毛主席，他们现在能生产三种炭黑，今年还准备试制一种新产品——高耐磨油机炉黑。毛主席听了点着头，微笑着说：“很好！”
    大家把毛主席送上了汽车，恋恋不舍地看着汽车开出气矿的大门。
    这天晚上，梁锡远激动得整夜不能入睡。他想起解放前在这个气矿的前身——盐厂当工人，受着资本家的打骂，过着挨饿的日子，解放后，共产党把他培养成为气矿的车间副主任，一家九口丰衣足食。这一切都是和毛主席的领导分不开的，今天梦想不到看见了最敬爱的领袖，而且还向领袖汇报了自己的工作，这实在是他一生中最幸福的事。他决心要为炭黑工业而贡献出一切。其他许多看见毛主席的人，也都逢人便津津有味地谈起当时的情景；那些因为离得远、没有能看到毛主席的人，也一次又一次地听着别人的叙述，分享这共有的欢乐。毛主席在百忙中还抽身来视察天然气的利用，来看望气矿的职工，是多么使他们感动。毛主席艰苦朴素的作风、平易近人的伟大形象，使他们感到终身难忘。
    在毛主席走后，全矿职工纷纷召开誓师会，要鼓足干劲、力争上游，争取更大的跃进。他们提出要更高地提高各种产品的质量，今年除了完成国家计划外，还要力争为国家增加一千万元的财富。这些日子来，全矿正以万马奔腾、势如破竹的气概飞跃前进，新纪录不断出现，许多生产中的关键问题一个接着一个被解决。在毛主席参观过的槽黑车间，工人们已经连续创造了两种解决生产关键问题的工具，彻底检修了机器，炭黑产量比毛主席来到以前提高了10％左右；这个矿的青年突击队已经着手用废旧材料，就在毛主席参观过的火房旁边，新修了两座“跃进号火房”，“五一”以前就可以投入生产。（附图片）
