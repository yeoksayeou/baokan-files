    Hebei Seizes Opportunity of Rain to Rush Planting, Unyielding in Anti-Drought Spirit
    Local Garrison and Tianjin All-Out Support for Farmers' Drought Resistance
    (Report) On the night of the auspicious rainfall (April 24), the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference, requiring cadres and farmers throughout the province to prevent any feelings of complacency and slackness, and to establish a long-term anti-drought mindset.
    This year, spring planting in Hebei Province has encountered a severe drought test. Although some areas have recently received rain, only forty-odd counties can solve the current planting problem. The drought situation has only been alleviated, not completely eliminated. The responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee put forward at the telephone conference that all localities should, according to the rainfall situation, vigorously mobilize the masses to carry out a crash planting campaign. Those who have had soaking rain should concentrate all their efforts on rushing to plant; those who have not had soaking rain should plant by taking advantage of the soil moisture or watering the soil to plant; areas with less rain or no rain should continue to resist drought and plant by hand, and never rely on the sky for rain. All localities must establish a long-term anti-drought mindset and prepare to fight against the most serious difficulties. After planting, continue to vigorously develop water conservancy, and never have any feelings of complacency and slackness. In taking advantage of soil moisture to rush planting, drought-resistant planting, and continuing to vigorously develop water conservancy, we must support each other, cooperate with each other, and continue to carry forward the spirit of communism.
    Today's "Hebei Daily" also published an editorial entitled "Establish a Long-Term Anti-Drought Mindset," proposing how to treat this small rain: take it as a favorable condition and use it, and "think of no rain when it rains," and still take out the same or even greater enthusiasm as before the rain to carry out drought-resistant planting, and do not become complacent, relax the drought resistance struggle, and relax water conservancy construction, so as not to turn the good thing of rainfall into a bad thing.
    (Report) The rain on April 24th encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing to plant, and the planting speed increased by leaps and bounds. Fourteen townships in the eastern suburbs have basically completed the spring planting task; four townships including Dongba and Jiuxianqiao have completed the spring planting task in the rain. More than 13,000 mu of spring-sown crops in Huangtugang Township Agricultural Society in Fengtai District had completed more than 12,000 mu by April 24th, and the remaining 1,000 mu could be completed in a rush, ten days earlier than last year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 24th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Hebei Province, under the slogan of "fighting drought during the day and training at night," are fully involved in the struggle to support local farmers in drought-resistant planting.
    In order to support local farmers to overcome the drought and plant in a timely manner, since mid-April, officers and soldiers of the garrisons in various parts of the province have either stopped exercises or stopped all work that can be stopped, and transferred automobiles, tractors, fire engines, water pumps, hand carts, horse carts, mules, and horses that can be transferred, and under the leadership of the heads of the troops, they have been fully involved in the drought-resistant planting struggle. A certain unit led by Major General Wang Qicai and Major General Zou Guohou helped agricultural societies in seven townships irrigate more than 390 mu of land and newly opened a 237-meter-long canal in three days. Forty-one officers and soldiers of a certain unit carried more than 4,000 loads of water and planted 16 mu of cotton on the first day of participating in drought resistance.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 23rd: People from all walks of life in Tianjin are fully supporting the drought resistance struggle of farmers in Hebei Province. Industrial enterprises, handicraft cooperatives, and party, government, and military organs at all levels in Tianjin carried out a comprehensive and emergency mobilization on the 16th. Cadres from large and small factories and party, government, and military organs, as well as officers and soldiers of the garrison, started overnight to take stock of and collect all the power machinery, irrigation and drainage equipment, and pipes of various specifications that could be squeezed out. In one night, more than 500 water pumps, more than 400 electric motors, more than 100 sets of pumping machines, and more than 1,000 meters of water pipes and other power and irrigation and drainage equipment were extracted.

    河北趁雨抢种抗旱斗志不懈
    当地驻军和天津各界全力支援农民抗旱
    本报讯　在普降喜雨的当天  （24日）夜晚，中共河北省委举行电话会议，要求全省各地干部和农民防止任何麻痹松懈情绪，树立长期抗旱的思想。
    今年河北省的春季播种，遇到了严重的干旱的考验，最近虽然有些地区落了雨，但仅有四十多个县可以解决当前的播种问题，旱象仅仅有所减轻，并未完全消除。省委负责同志在电话会议上提出，各地要根据雨情，大力发动群众开展突击抢种运动。已经下透雨的，要集中全力抢种；没有下透的，要借墒播种或趁墒浇水播种；下雨较小或没有下雨的地区，要继续抗旱点种，绝不要靠天等雨。各地一定要树立长期抗旱的思想，准备向最严重的困难作斗争。在播种之后，要继续大搞水利，绝不要有任何麻痹松懈思想。在趁墒抢种、抗旱播种和继续大搞水利当中，要互相支援，互相协作，继续发扬共产主义精神。
    今天的“河北日报”并以“树立长期抗旱的思想”为题发表社论，提出应当怎样对待这一场小雨：要把它作为有利条件，利用它，要“有雨当思无雨时”，仍然拿出落雨以前一样甚至更大的干劲去进行抗旱播种，而不要麻痹起来，放松抗旱斗争放松水利建设，以至把落雨这件好事变成坏事。
    本报讯　24日这场雨鼓舞了北京市郊区广大农民播种的干劲，播种速度突飞猛进。东郊区的十四个乡，基本完成春播任务；东坝、酒仙桥等四个乡，已经冒雨完成了春播任务。丰台区黄土岗乡农业社的一万三千多亩春播作物，到24日已经播完了一万二千多亩，剩下的一千多亩，可以突击完成，比去年提前十天播完。
    据新华社天津24日电　驻河北省各地的中国人民解放军部队在“白天抗旱、黑夜训练”的口号下，全力投入支援当地农民抗旱播种的斗争。
    为支援当地农民战胜干旱、适时播种，全省各地驻军官兵从4月中旬起，有的停止操课，有的停止一切可以停止的工作，并抽调可能调用的汽车、拖拉机、消防车、水泵、手推车、马车以及骡马等，在部队首长率领下，全力投入抗旱播种斗争。由王奇才少将、邹国厚少将率领的某部队，在三天中，就帮助七个乡的农业社浇地三百九十多亩，并且新开了一条二百三十七公尺长的水渠。某部四十一名官兵在参加抗旱的头一天，就担水四千多担，播种了十六亩棉花。
    据新华社天津23日电　天津市各界人民全力支援河北省农民的抗旱斗争。天津市的工业企业、手工业社以及党、政、军各级机关16日进行了全面紧急的动员，大小工厂和党、政、军机关的干部和驻军官兵一齐动手，连夜行动起来清点、搜集一切能够挤出来的动力机械、排灌设备和各种规格的管子。一夜之间就抽出五百多台水泵、四百多部电动机、一百多套抽水机和一千多公尺抽水管等动力和排灌设备。
