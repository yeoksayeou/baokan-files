American Vignettes in the Shadow of Crisis

	A Desolate City
	In Detroit, the heart of the American automobile industry, unsold cars now number 900,000, and automobile factories continue to lay off workers. According to the "New York Times," as of April 1, the city's unemployment had reached 265,000, with an average of one in six workers unemployed.
	"Time Magazine" says that Detroit is now filled with desolate scenes, with more than 40,000 unemployed workers having exhausted their unemployment benefits and completely lost their source of income. Some stores are repossessing cars and furniture that unemployed workers are unable to pay for. Entertainment venues are deserted. Some cinemas offer discounted rates to workers with proof of unemployment benefits in order to attract customers. One cinema even stays open all night so that unemployed workers can spend the night there, because a ticket costs less than a day's rent. It is said that this is a "habit" unique to past economic crises. Food stores specialize in selling day-old, stale food cheaply to the unemployed. Unemployed workers are looking for work everywhere, and there are often long lines in front of restaurants, hoping to get a few hours of dishwashing and odd jobs.
	As the number of people falling into poverty increases daily, "Time Magazine" says that the number of thefts and robberies in Detroit has recently increased rapidly.
		"Psychological" Tactics
	The "Boatmen's National Bank" of St. Louis, with a history of more than 100 years, recently published large advertisements in many newspapers, promoting to the public that in the current economic crisis, "excessive savings are as harmful as excessive spending." It is a strange thing that a bank, as a savings institution, would promote that saving is harmful.
	Why did this old bank suddenly change its business policy? It turns out that Eisenhower has repeatedly called loudly at recent press conferences, asking American capitalists to improve their marketing methods and use sophisticated advertising to "sell" more goods. On the other hand, he appealed to the American people not to be stingy with their savings, but to "buy everything." He believes that this can overcome the crisis.
	American newspapers say that in order to sell things to the American people who do not need and do not want to buy things, a "psychological war" is beginning. The New York Advertising Council is preparing a four-month "anti-recession campaign," and many commercial and business organizations will also publicize in newspapers, radio, and television programs that the American people should believe that "living in an ever-expanding America, your future is great." The "Boatmen's National Bank" advertisement is just a small episode in this "psychological war!"
		A Wave of Bankruptcies
	The April 18th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" said that a wave of bankruptcies is sweeping across the United States, with an average of 45 to 50 large, medium, and small-scale industrial and commercial enterprises going bankrupt every day due to heavy debts.
	The magazine said that if this rate continues to develop, it is expected that at least 14,000 companies and enterprises will go bankrupt this year, which is the highest number in nearly 20 years, an increase of 27% compared to 1956.
	In addition, voluntary closures are increasing. Many small businesses have been merged by large enterprises under the attack of the economic crisis. The companies and enterprises that are currently going bankrupt the most are in the automotive, hardware, household appliances, furniture, and clothing industries. In addition, the number of bankrupt restaurants and eateries is also increasing.
		Jobs Difficult to Secure
	The April 18th "U.S. News & World Report" also pointed out that because the impact of this crisis is very widespread and profound, those company and enterprise employees who were not significantly affected during the two economic recessions in 1949 and 1954 are now also seriously threatened by unemployment, just like workers.
	Some railway enterprises, metallurgical industries, machinery, automobile, and aircraft manufacturing industries have been laying off engineering technicians, sales personnel, accountants, advertisers, and stenographers, etc. Many stores have also laid off shop assistants in large numbers. Retail stores in Detroit have laid off 6,000 shop assistants due to poor business. Many enterprises, especially heavy industry departments, have generally reduced employee salaries by 10% to 30%. The magazine said that due to widespread layoffs and cost-cutting by companies and enterprises, it is difficult for laid-off personnel to find work again.

    在危机阴影里的美国小景
    凄凉的城市
    在美国汽车制造业中心的底特律市，卖不出去的汽车现在已达九十万辆，汽车工厂继续裁人。据“纽约时报”消息，截至4月1日为止，这个城市失业人数已达二十六万五千人，平均每六个工人中就有一个失业。
    美国“时代周刊”说，底特律现在充满了凄凉景象，四万多名失业工人领取救济金的期限已满，生活来源全部断绝。一些商店已在收回失业工人无力偿付的汽车和家具。娱乐场所冷冷清清，有些电影院为了招徕顾客，对持有领取失业救济金证明的工人减价优待，有一家电影院甚至通宵开放，以便失业工人可在电影院里过夜，因为一张票钱比一天的房租要便宜得多，据说这是过去经济危机时期所特有的“习惯”。食品店专门将隔日不新鲜的食物廉价卖给失业者。失业工人到处找工作，饭馆前常常站着很长的队伍，希望能得到几小时的洗盘子和打杂的工作。
    由于陷于贫困的人数日多，据“时代周刊”说，底特律最近盗窃和抢劫的案件已迅速增加。
        “心理”战术
    圣路易城一家有一百多年历史的“布特曼国民银行”，不久前在许多报刊上大登广告，向市民宣传说，在目前经济危机时期，“过多的储蓄同过度的挥霍一样是有害的”。作为储蓄机构的银行竟宣传储蓄有害，倒是奇闻。
    这家老牌银行为什么突然改变营业方针呢？原来艾森豪威尔在最近几次记者招待会上，一再大声疾呼，要求美国资本家改进推销办法，利用精湛的广告多“卖出”东西；另一方面，又呼吁美国人民不要吝惜那一点积蓄，“购买一切东西”。他认为这样就可以克服危机。
    美国报刊说，为了把东西卖给不需要而且也不想买东西的美国人民，一场“心理战”正在开始。纽约广告理事会正在准备为期四个月的“反衰退运动”，许多商业和企业组织也将在报刊、电台和电视节目中宣传，要美国人民相信，“生活在不断扩展的美国，你的前途是伟大的”。“布特曼国民银行”的广告就是这场“心理战”的小插曲！
          一片倒风
    4月18日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”说，目前美国各地卷起一片倒风，平均每天全国有四十五家到五十家大、中、小规模的工商业企业，因负债累累而倒闭。
    这家杂志说，如果按照这个速度继续发展，预计今年至少将有一万四千家以上的公司和企业倒闭，这是近二十年来最高数字，比1956年增加27％。
    除此以外，自动歇业的已日益增多。许多小型企业在经济危机的袭击下被大企业合并了。目前倒闭最多的公司和企业是汽车、五金、家用器具、家具、服装等行业。此外，倒闭的饮食店和饭馆也日益增加。
          饭碗难保
    4月18日的“美国新闻与世界报道”还指出，由于这次危机的影响非常广泛和深刻，那些在1949年和1954年两次经济衰退时期不受什么影响的公司企业职员，现在也和工人一样受到失业的严重威胁。
    一些铁路企业、冶金工业、机器、汽车和飞机制造业已在裁减工程技术人员、营业人员、会计、广告员和速记员等等。许多商店也大批解雇店员。底特律的零售商店由于营业惨淡，已有六千名店员被解雇。许多企业，特别是重工业部门，普遍减少职员薪金10％至30％。这家杂志说，由于公司和企业普遍裁员和节省开支，被裁人员很难再找到工作。
