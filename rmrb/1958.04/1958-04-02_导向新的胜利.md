    Guiding Towards New Victories
    The Fifth Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held its first meeting from March 27th to 31st. At the meeting, Comrade Voroshilov was re-elected as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Comrade Khrushchev was appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and a new government was formed. The meeting heard and discussed Comrade Khrushchev's report on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations, Comrade Gromyko's statement on the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, and adopted corresponding resolutions and documents. We are excited to see that this Supreme Soviet meeting has done work of great significance for the Soviet people and all mankind. Undoubtedly, the great achievements of the meeting will have a significant and far-reaching impact on the future of the Soviet Union's communist construction, world peace, and the cause of human progress.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have made brilliant achievements in communist construction. The Soviet Union's economic construction and cultural construction are flourishing, science and technology are changing rapidly, and people's welfare is constantly increasing. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has grasped the main links of each historical development stage and has successfully guided the cause of communist construction forward. The industrial management reorganization work implemented not long ago has already achieved significant results. Following the reorganization of industrial management, the important task of further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations has been brought to the forefront. In order to open up broader prospects for agricultural productivity, to produce more abundant agricultural products for the country, and to further improve the material welfare of the people, the proposal of this task is obviously very timely and necessary.
    The question of further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations is of utmost importance to the development of Soviet socialist agriculture and the development of the entire national economy. Therefore, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided that before submitting this issue to the Supreme Soviet meeting for discussion, the outline of Comrade Khrushchev's report on this issue should first be submitted for nationwide discussion. The results of nearly a month of nationwide discussion show that the proposals of the CPSU Central Committee on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations have been wholeheartedly supported and endorsed by the entire Soviet people. Now, this proposal has been discussed and passed by the Supreme Soviet meeting and has become the law of the Soviet state, becoming a fighting program for the entire Soviet people to strive for a new upsurge in socialist agriculture. The realization of this fighting program will greatly advance Soviet agriculture and further improve the living standards of the people.
    The Soviet people have always made unremitting efforts to maintain world peace and promote mutual trust and cooperation among countries. Recently, the Soviet government has put forward a series of major peace initiatives, advocating the early convening of a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries, the immediate cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing, the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, the signing of a non-aggression treaty between member states of the Warsaw Pact and member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and so on. The Soviet Union has shown its sincerity with practical actions. Not long ago, in order to promote the solution of international disarmament issues, the Soviet Union announced a reduction of 300,000 troops, bringing the number of Soviet troops reduced since 1955 to 2,140,000. This time, in order to free mankind from the threat of atomic war and to set an example for the United States and Britain in stopping nuclear weapon testing, the Supreme Soviet meeting, based on the new initiative of the Soviet government put forward by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, adopted a resolution on the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing. This major action by the Soviet Union once again demonstrated the Soviet people's peaceful will and sincerity in promoting mutual trust and cooperation among countries, and made another major contribution to world peace and the cause of human progress.
    It is full of confidence in its own strength. It believes that the important measures on further developing the collective farm system, with the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, will surely achieve new victories in solving the tasks of communist construction; at the same time, it also believes that the just action of the Soviet Union unilaterally stopping atomic and hydrogen weapon testing will surely be supported by the people of the world and will play an important role in further resolving the current important international issues.
    The important work carried out by the Supreme Soviet meeting will bring happiness and peace to the entire Soviet people and all mankind. We express our warm congratulations on the great achievements of the Supreme Soviet meeting. In the new struggle to build communism and maintain world peace, the Soviet people will surely achieve even more brilliant victories under the leadership of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union.

    导向新的胜利
    第五届苏联最高苏维埃在3月27日到31日举行了第一次会议。会上推选了伏罗希洛夫同志继续担任苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席，任命了赫鲁晓夫同志担任苏联部长会议主席，并且产生了新的政府。会议听取和讨论了赫鲁晓夫同志关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的报告、葛罗米柯同志关于苏联单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验的声明，并通过了相应的决议和文件。我们兴奋地看到，这次苏联最高苏维埃会议为苏联人民和全人类进行了具有重要意义的工作。无疑地，会议的巨大成就，对于今后苏联共产主义建设事业，对于世界和平和人类进步事业都将有重大而深远的影响。
    近年来，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，在共产主义建设方面取得了辉煌的成就。苏联的经济建设事业和文化建设事业正在蓬勃发展，科学技术日新月异，人民福利不断增长。苏联共产党抓住每一个历史发展阶段的主要环节，胜利地引导着共产主义建设事业前进。不久前实行的工业管理改组工作，已经取得了重大的成绩。随着工业管理的改组，进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站这一重要任务又提到了首要的地位。为了给农业生产力开辟更加广阔的天地，为了给国家生产更加丰足的农产品和进一步提高人民的物质福利，这个任务的提出，显然是十分适时和必要的。
    关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的问题，对于苏联社会主义农业的发展和整个国民经济的发展都具有极其重要的意义。因此，苏联共产党中央委员会二月全会决定，在把这一问题提交苏联最高苏维埃会议讨论以前，首先将赫鲁晓夫同志关于这一问题的报告提纲交付全民讨论。将近一个月的全民大讨论的结果表明，苏共中央关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的建议得到了全体苏联人民的衷心支持和拥护。现在，这一建议已经苏联最高苏维埃会议讨论并通过而成为苏维埃国家的法律，成为苏联全体人民争取社会主义农业新高涨的战斗纲领。这一战斗纲领的实现，将使苏联的农业大大向前跃进，使人民的生活水平更加提高。
    苏联人民一向为维护世界和平、促使各国互相信任和合作而进行着不懈的努力。最近一个时期，苏联政府提出了一系列的重大的和平倡议，主张尽早召开东西方国家最高级会议，立刻停止原子武器和氢武器试验，在中欧建立无原子武器地区，由华沙条约成员国和北大西洋公约成员国签订互不侵犯条约等等。苏联用实际行动表示了自己的诚意。不久前，为了促进国际裁军问题的解决，苏联又宣布裁军三十万人，使从1955年以来苏联裁军的人数增加到二百一十四万人。这一次，为了使人类摆脱原子战争的威胁，在停止核武器试验方面为美英作出榜样，苏联最高苏维埃会议又就苏联外交部长葛罗米柯提出的苏联政府的新倡议，通过关于苏联单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验的决议。苏联这一重大的行动，再一次显示了苏联人民的和平意志和促进各国相互信任与合作的诚意，对世界和平和人类进步事业作出了又一重大贡献。
    对自己的力量充满信心。它相信关于进一步发展集体农庄制度的重要措施在全国人民热烈支持下，一定会在解决共产主义建设的任务中取得新的胜利；同时，它也相信苏联单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验的正义行动，一定会得到全世界人民的支持，对进一步解决当前重要的国际问题发生重要的作用。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议所进行的重要工作，将给苏联全体人民和全人类带来了幸福与和平。我们对苏联最高苏维埃会议的伟大成就表示热烈的祝贺。在建设共产主义和维护世界和平的新的斗争中，苏联人民必将在苏联共产党和政府的领导下取得更加辉煌的胜利。
