    Eliminating the Four Pests Should Also Be Based on Reality
    Ding Qinchang, Wuxi, Jiangsu
    I have learned a lot from participating in the Four Pests Elimination Campaign. Many units and individuals have set plans and goals, demonstrating their determination to eliminate the pests completely, which is very exciting.
    However, I also see some phenomena that are not based on reality. One agency set a goal to guarantee the elimination of 500 sparrows per week, but by the end of the week, they had only caught 300. So, they mobilized the nearby children to catch them, and then bought them for five cents each, counting them as caught by the agency.
    I think this is not a good practice. The Four Pests Elimination Campaign requires everyone to work hard to eliminate the four pests and to persist in the long term until the four pests are completely eliminated. Setting numerical targets is to have a goal to strive for, which facilitates everyone's actions and also facilitates supervision and inspection, not just for the sake of this number. If everyone has done their best, it is good even if they have not caught enough 500. As for not catching them all, we must continue to catch them. On the contrary, if you don't try your best and rely on buying them to make up the numbers, that cannot be considered advanced. Of course, organizing family members and mobilizing children to assist in eliminating the four pests is also a way, but the style of "buying to make up the numbers" is always wrong. If we look at "buying to make up the numbers" as a style, it is not only reflected in eliminating the four pests. Shouldn't the leaders of each of our agencies check whether there is also a "buying to make up the numbers" mentality in their minds? Even if it is only reflected in some specific events, it should be eliminated.

### 除四害也要实事求是

    除四害也要实事求是
    江苏无锡　丁勤昌
    参加了除四害运动，受了不少教育。很多单位和很多人，都订了规划和计划，表现了除害务尽的决心，使人兴奋万分。
    但也看到一些不够实事求是的现象。有个机关订了保证每周消灭麻雀五百只的计划，可是快到周末的时候，还只捉到三百只。于是，他们就发动附近的孩子们去捉，再用每只五分钱买来，算是本机关捉到的。
    我觉得这样做法不好，除四害运动，是要每个人努力去除四害，而且要长期坚持下去做到彻底消灭四害为止。订出个数字指标，是为了有个奋斗目标，大家便于行动，也便于督促检查，而不是单单为了这个数字。如果人人都已尽了最大努力，就是没有捉够五百只，也算是好的；至于没有捉尽，还要继续去捉。相反，如果没有尽力去做，而靠买来充数，那也不能算是先进的。当然，组织家属、发动孩子来协助除四害，也是一种办法，但“买来充数”的作风总是不对的。“买来充数”，如果当作一种作风看，又不只表现在除四害上。我们每个机关的领导者是不是应该检查一下，是否自己脑子里也有“买来充数”的思想呢？尽管这只表现在一些具体事件上，也该清除掉。
