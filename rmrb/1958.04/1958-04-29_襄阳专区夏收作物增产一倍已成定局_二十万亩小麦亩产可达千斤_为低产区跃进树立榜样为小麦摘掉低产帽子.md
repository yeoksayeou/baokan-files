(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch from the 28th) Can agricultural production in low-yield areas really take a leap forward? The Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province, famous for its large-scale water conservancy projects, proves with the fact of a bumper summer harvest: it can not only leap forward but also advance at a rapid pace. Currently, more than five million people in Xiangyang Prefecture are welcoming a bumper harvest of summer crops with boundless joy. According to preliminary estimates, the average yield per mu of the prefecture's ten million mu of summer crops this year can reach about 300 jin, and the total output of the entire region can reach about 3 billion jin, more than double the yield of summer crops last year, equivalent to 75% of the total grain output of last year, and more than ten times the yield of summer crops before liberation, exceeding the original plan by 50%. Among them, the summer crop grain output of counties such as Guanghua, Xiangyang, and Zaoyang can exceed the total grain output of last year.

The reporter recently accompanied Comrade Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, and the spring plowing production inspection group, to visit the main wheat-producing areas of Xiangyang Prefecture, including Xiangyang, Gucheng, Yicheng, and Guanghua. Across hundreds of kilometers of plains, hills, and mountains, wheat is flowering and filling, and a bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion; in a few more days, it can be harvested. This year, the wheat stalks in this prefecture are tall and dense, with large ears and many grains. According to measurements by engineers from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, many wheat plants are over 150 cm tall, with an average of about 200,000 plants per mu, and the best wheat in Gucheng County averages 300,000 plants per mu (the most being one million plants per mu), more than twice the number of wheat plants in general areas. Many wheat ears are more than two inches long, and the wheat in Gucheng County averages more than 30 grains per ear, more than twice the general amount, with some having more than 100 grains.

The biggest characteristic of this year's summer harvest crops in this prefecture is large-scale, high-yield, and bumper harvests. According to preliminary estimates, about 200,000 mu of wheat in the entire prefecture can yield around 1,000 jin per mu; more than 260,000 mu of wheat in Gucheng and Xiangfan City can yield an average of more than 500 jin per mu; and Gucheng County also has more than 300 mu, which is expected to yield about 2,000 jin of wheat per mu. Such a miracle of large-scale high yield not only exists in the plains but also appears in large quantities in mountainous areas that have always been considered sparsely populated and infertile. The tenth team of the Millionaire Agricultural Cooperative in the mountainous area of Gucheng County has 205 mu of wheat, all of which can reach about 1,000 jin per mu. In the past, people said that wheat was a low-yield crop, but now the people of Xiangyang Prefecture have removed the label of low-yield from wheat.

Xiangyang Prefecture is located in the northwest of Hubei Province, mostly hilly and mountainous, with barren land and little rainfall, and has always been known as a low-yield grain area. Before liberation, although some areas also grew wheat, the yield per mu was only 50 or 60 jin, and the total output of summer crops in the entire region was only about 600 million jin. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of farmers realized agricultural collectivization and made many other efforts, and the harvest of summer crops has greatly increased over the years. By 1957, the yield per mu had increased to more than 160 jin, and the total output had reached more than 1.4 billion jin. In order to achieve a greater leap forward in agricultural production, since the second half of 1957, from the leaders to the masses in Xiangyang Prefecture, a resolute struggle has been waged against conservative thinking. Before winter sowing last year, some people had doubts about whether agricultural production could take a leap forward. The Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee initially proposed the goal of reaching a total output of 2 billion jin in this season, and some people thought that the increase in production speed was too great and could not be completed. In order to solve this problem, large-scale airing of views, great contending, and great debates were widely carried out in various places. The Sanhe Cooperative in Hugang Township, Gucheng County, is a very poor land area. Some teams only harvested a little more than one jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1955, and the average yield of grain per mu in 1957 was only more than 200 jin. During the winter sowing in 1957, activists in this cooperative proposed a leap-forward goal of catching up with the neighboring cooperative—the Gongtong Cooperative—which had good soil quality and high yields. This plan was immediately opposed by people with conservative ideas. The entire cooperative promptly launched a large-scale debate, finally breaking the conservative thinking of some people. Everyone mustered their energy and worked hard, and as a result, this year's summer crops can yield an average of more than 700 jin per mu. At the same time, the work style of cadres at all levels has greatly changed, and cadres have universally engaged in experimental fields. According to statistics, cadres throughout the region have cultivated more than 350,000 mu of experimental wheat fields. As the reporter saw along the way, the vast majority of experimental fields have achieved high yields. Many of the high-yield fields in Gucheng County with a yield of 2,000 jin per mu are cadre experimental fields. In the great leap forward in production, this prefecture paid special attention to technological innovation. Most of the wheat in the region was sown in strips and densely planted, and fertilizers were increased and field management was strengthened. The average number of wheat plants per mu increased from about 100,000 in the past to 200,000 or 300,000, and the amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased from no fertilizer or little fertilizer to 200 or 300 dan, and many areas carried out new seedling transplantation techniques to solve the problem of missing seedlings. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor, the entire region universally promoted the reform of transportation tools. In less than a month in January and February this year, the plains areas of the entire region used carts instead of carrying people on their shoulders, and the mountainous areas widely used sliding wire transportation, which greatly improved labor efficiency. The masses created various new tools and made more than 70,000 carts in less than a month. All this has prepared for a bumper harvest of summer crops.

In the above-mentioned tasks, Xiangyang Prefecture closely mobilized the masses and relied on the strength and wisdom of the masses, which made the great leap forward in production truly form a broad and profound mass movement, and it seems that many major problems that are not easy to solve are quickly solved. Before winter sowing last year, this prefecture had no heavy rain for three months, and sowing was very difficult. However, due to the full play of the enthusiasm of the broad masses, drought-resistant sowing was implemented, and some places carried water from very far away to sow, and finally successfully completed the sowing plan. This spring, many areas were still dry and rainless for a long time, and many wheat seedlings were dried up and withered. The masses of farmers watered more than 1 million mu of wheat, keeping the wheat seedlings vigorous.

In order to promote the advanced experience of high wheat yield in Xiangyang Prefecture, especially in Gucheng County, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee has decided to hold an on-site meeting in Gucheng County in early May with the participation of the first secretaries of all county party committees to visit and learn, summarize the summer harvest, and arrange for winter sowing, in order to prepare for a bumper summer harvest in the province next year.

    襄阳专区夏收作物增产一倍已成定局
    二十万亩小麦亩产可达千斤
    为低产区跃进树立榜样为小麦摘掉低产帽子
    本报武汉28日电　低产地区农业生产到底能不能跃进？以大兴水利闻名的湖北省襄阳专区用夏收作物大丰收的事实证明：不仅能够跃进，而且能够飞速地跃进。目前，襄阳专区五百多万人民以无限喜悦的心情，迎接夏收作物大丰收。据初步预计，这个专区今年一千万亩夏收作物平均每亩产量能达三百斤左右，全区总产量可达三十亿斤上下，比去年夏收作物增产一倍以上，相当于去年全年粮食产量的75％，比解放前夏收作物的产量增加十倍多，超过原来计划50％。其中光化、襄阳、枣阳等县夏收作物粮食产量，都可超过去年全年粮食产量。
    记者最近随同中共湖北省委第一书记王任重同志率领的春耕生产检查团，参观了襄阳专区襄阳、谷城、宜城、光化等主要产麦地区。纵横数百公里的平原、山岗、丘陵，小麦扬花灌浆，豆类粒圆荚满，丰收已成定局，再有几天即可收割了。今年这个专区小麦秸高株密，穗大粒多，据省农业厅工程师测量，很多小麦高达一百五十公分以上，一般每亩平均都有二十万株左右，小麦最好的谷城县平均每亩有三十万株（最多的每亩有一百万株），比一般地区的小麦株数多二倍以上。很多麦穗长有二寸多，谷城县小麦平均每穗三十多粒，比一般的多一倍多，最多的有一百多粒。
    这个专区今年夏收作物的最大特点是大面积高额丰产。据初步预计，全区约有二十万亩小麦可以亩产一千斤上下；谷城和襄樊市二十六万多亩小麦，平均每亩可产五百斤以上；谷城县还有三百多亩预计每亩可以收到小麦二千斤左右。这样大面积丰产的奇迹，不仅平原地区有，而且一向被认为人稀地薄的山区也大块出现。谷城县山区的百万富翁农业社第十队，有二百零五亩小麦，全部可以达到亩产千斤左右。过去人们说小麦是低产作物，现在襄阳专区的人民已为小麦摘掉了低产帽子。
    襄阳专区位于湖北省西北部，多系丘陵和山区，土地瘠薄，雨量较少，一向被称为粮食低产地区。解放前有些地区虽然也种小麦，但每亩收成不过五、六十斤，全区夏收作物总产量不过六亿斤左右。解放后，广大农民在党的领导下实现了农业合作化，并且作了其他许多努力，历年来夏收作物收获量有了很大增长。到1957年，每亩产量提高到一百六十多斤，总产量达到十四亿多斤。为了农业生产更大的跃进，从1957年下半年以来，襄阳专区从领导到群众，与保守思想开展了坚决的斗争。去年冬季播种前，有人曾对农业生产能不能大跃进抱怀疑态度，中共襄阳地委开始提出了这一季总产量达到二十亿斤的指标，有些人认为增产速度太大，不能完成。为了解决这个问题，各地普遍开展了大鸣大放大辩论。谷城县胡岗乡三合社是个土地很坏的地区，有些队在1955年每亩只收一斤多皮棉，1957年粮食平均每亩产量只有二百多斤。1957年冬播时，这个社里的积极分子提出了向土质好、收成高的邻社——共同社看齐的跃进目标。这个计划立即遭到了有保守思想的人的反对。全社及时开展了一场大辩论，终于打破了某些人的保守思想，大家鼓足了干劲，实干苦干，结果今年夏收作物平均每亩能收七百斤以上。同时，各级干部作风大大转变，干部普遍搞了试验田，据统计，全区干部搞的小麦试验田有三十五万多亩。记者沿途所见，绝大部分试验田都获得丰产。谷城县亩产二千斤的高额丰产田，很多都是干部试验田。在生产大跃进中，这个专区特别注意了技术革新。全区大部小麦都进行了条播密植，并且增施肥料、加强田间管理，小麦平均每亩由过去的十万株左右增加到二、三十万株，由过去不施肥或施肥少变为每亩施肥二、三百担，并且很多地区进行了育苗移栽新技术，解决了缺苗问题。为了解决劳力不足的困难，全区普遍推行了运输工具改革，今年1、2月份不到一个月时间，就使全区平原地区使用车子代替肩挑人背，山区广泛使用滑丝运输，大大提高了劳动效率。群众创造了各种各样的新工具，不到一个月就造成了七万多辆车子。这一切都为夏收作物丰收作好了准备。
    襄阳专区在上述各项工作中，都是紧紧发动群众、依靠群众的力量和智慧进行的，这就使生产大跃进真正形成了一个广泛的深刻的群众运动，看来是不大好解决的许多重大问题，很快地解决了。去年冬播前，这个专区三个月没有下透雨，播种十分困难。但由于充分发挥了广大群众的积极性，实行抗旱播种，有的地方从很远的地方挑水播种，终于胜利地完成了播种计划。今年春天，很多地区仍是久旱无雨，不少麦苗干得枯黄，农民群众又车水浇了一百多万亩小麦，使麦苗始终保持旺盛。
    为了推广襄阳专区特别是谷城县小麦丰产的先进经验，中共湖北省委已经决定5月上旬在谷城县召开全省各县委第一书记参加的现场会议，参观学习，总结夏收，布置冬播，为明年全省夏收作物大丰收早作准备。
