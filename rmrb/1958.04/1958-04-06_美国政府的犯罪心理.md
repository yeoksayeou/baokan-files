The Criminal Psychology of the U.S. Government
By Our Staff Commentator

The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 4th, rejecting the request by Powell's lawyer, Willing, the former editor of the "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai, that the U.S. government negotiate with the Chinese government to conclude a judicial assistance agreement so that Chinese witnesses could provide evidence for the Powell case. The U.S. government's rejection of this reasonable request can only show that it is still attempting to conduct an unfair trial of Mr. and Mrs. Powell and impose unwarranted charges on them.

The U.S. authorities filed the charges against Mr. and Mrs. Powell in 1956. The "crime" they are accused of is that they published news in the former "China Weekly Review" in Shanghai that accused the United States of aggression against Korea and China, engaging in bacteriological warfare, and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations. Obviously, this case involves the facts of U.S. aggression against China, and only by obtaining testimonies and evidence provided by Chinese witnesses can a fair trial be possible. And for the United States to obtain the evidence necessary for the trial of this case from China, the two countries should first sign a judicial assistance agreement on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. This is the usual practice between any two sovereign states and the proper norm in modern international relations. Therefore, the U.S. government's refusal to negotiate with China on the issue of judicial assistance is, in fact, refusing to allow Chinese witnesses to provide full evidence for the Powell case. This shows that the U.S. authorities' past statements that they did not exclude the evidence provided by Chinese witnesses for the Powell case were merely deceiving the American people and public opinion.

The request for the Chinese government to provide judicial assistance for the Powell case was originally made to the Chinese Ministry of Justice by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California last September. In view of the Powell case and other cases that may occur in the future involving requests for judicial assistance from either of the two countries, the Chinese government believes that this request could be considered if the two governments reach an agreement on judicial assistance. At the 73rd Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks held on December 12 last year, the Chinese government took the initiative to suggest that China and the United States hold negotiations in order to reach an agreement on the issue of providing judicial assistance to each other on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. However, this proposal was unreasonably rejected by the United States. Despite this, when Powell's defense lawyer, Willing, came to China this year, Shi Liang, the Minister of Justice of China, reiterated to Willing the Chinese government's position on the issue of Sino-U.S. judicial assistance: China can provide judicial assistance for the Powell case only after the Chinese and U.S. governments reach an agreement on judicial assistance. If the U.S. government is truly sincere in requesting China to provide judicial assistance, then there is no reason to refuse to negotiate with the Chinese government on this issue.

However, the U.S. government has always adopted an intolerable and arrogant attitude on this issue. It wants China to provide judicial assistance, but it refuses to negotiate with the Chinese government on this issue. The U.S. government's rejection of Willing's request once again proves this self-contradictory and absurd practice. The U.S. government's unreasonable attitude on this issue, in addition to showing that it is hostile to the Chinese people and attempts to continue to flaunt its imperialist arrogance in front of the Chinese people, further shows that it does not intend to use any evidence provided by witnesses in the trial of the Powell case, but only attempts to conduct an unfair trial of Mr. and Mrs. Powell with unwarranted charges.

Everyone knows that the charges brought by the U.S. authorities against Mr. and Mrs. Powell are fundamentally untenable. The U.S. authorities' prosecution of them is nothing more than creating deceptive propaganda to whitewash and cover up the U.S. crimes of aggression against China and Korea, engaging in bacteriological warfare, and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations. And these acts of aggression by the United States are undeniable facts that it cannot whitewash no matter what tricks it plays. The U.S. government's refusal to negotiate with the Chinese government on the issue of judicial assistance, thereby refusing to allow Chinese witnesses to provide full evidence for the Powell case, precisely demonstrates this criminal psychology of the U.S. government.

    美国政府的犯罪心理
    本报评论员
    美国国务院4日发表声明，拒绝了前上海“密勒氏评论报”主笔鲍惠尔的律师威林要美国政府同我国政府商谈订立司法协助协议、以便中国证人能为鲍惠尔案提供证据的要求。美国政府对这个合理的请求的拒绝，只能说明它仍然在企图对鲍惠尔夫妇进行不公正的审判，而把莫须有的罪名强加在他们的头上。
    美国当局对鲍惠尔夫妇的控诉案，是在1956年提出的。他们被控的“罪名”是，曾经在前上海“密勒氏评论报”上发表指责美国侵略朝鲜和中国、进行细菌战、破坏朝鲜停战谈判等消息。很显然，这个案件是牵涉到美国对中国进行侵略的事实真相的，只有得到中国证人提供的证词和证据，才有可能进行公正的审判。而美国要从中国得到进行审判这一案件所必不可少的证据，中美两国之间应当首先签订平等互惠的司法协助协议。这是任何两个主权国家之间的通常惯例，也是现代国际关系中应有的准则。因此，美国政府拒绝同我国商谈司法协助的问题，实际上就是拒绝中国证人为鲍惠尔案件提供充分的证据。这说明，美国当局过去说它并不排斥中国证人对鲍惠尔案件所提供的证据，只不过是在欺骗美国人民和舆论。
    要求我国政府对鲍惠尔案件给予司法协助，本来是美国加利福尼亚北区区法院在去年9月向我国司法部提出来的。我国政府鉴于鲍惠尔案件和将来可能发生的牵涉到两国中任何一国要求司法协助的其他案件，认为如果两国政府达成司法协助的协议的话，这个请求是可以考虑的。在去年12月12日举行的第七十三次中美大使级会谈中，我国政府主动建议中美两国举行谈判，以便就在平等互惠基础上彼此给予司法协助的问题达成协议。可是，这个建议却遭到了美国方面的无理拒绝。虽然如此，在今年鲍惠尔的辩护律师威林到中国来的时候，我国司法部部长史良又向威林重申了我国政府对中美两国司法协助问题的立场：只要在中美两国政府达成司法协助的协议以后，我国就能对鲍惠尔案件给予司法协助。如果美国政府真有诚意请求我国给予司法协助，那就没有任何理由拒绝同我国政府就这个问题进行商谈。
    可是，美国政府在这个问题上，一直采取使人不能容忍的傲慢态度。它又要我国给予司法协助，又不肯同我国政府就这个问题进行谈判。美国政府对威林的要求表示拒绝，再一次证明了这种自相矛盾的荒谬做法。美国政府在这个问题上采取这样无理的态度，除了表明它敌视中国人民，企图继续在中国人民面前摆它的帝国主义臭架子以外；更表明了它对鲍惠尔案件的审判，根本不打算要什么证人提供的证据，而只企图用莫须有的罪名对鲍惠尔夫妇进行不公正的审判。
    大家都晓得，美国当局对鲍惠尔夫妇提出的控诉案，是根本不能成立的。美国当局对他们提起诉讼，无非是在制造欺骗宣传，以洗刷和掩盖美国侵略中国和朝鲜、进行细菌战和破坏朝鲜停战谈判等罪行。而美国的这些侵略罪行，是千真万确的，是任凭它玩什么花样也洗刷不了的。美国政府拒绝同我国政府商谈司法协助问题，从而拒绝中国证人为鲍惠尔案件提供充分的证据，正表明了美国政府的这种犯罪心理。
