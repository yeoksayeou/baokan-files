    "I am so happy that the motherland is strong!"
    —Visiting Liu Lianren and his family
    By our reporters Liu Zhongping and Shi Jian
    On April 16th, the second day after compatriot Liu Lianren returned to Tianjin, we visited him and asked him to recount his fourteen years of suffering. His joy at the strength of the motherland, expressed in his still-unaltered local accent, was all the more captivating. He is not a legendary hero, but from him, we can fully feel the tenacity and indomitable vitality of the Chinese working people.
    "I never dreamed that the country would be governed so well!"
    Liu Lianren began by saying, "As soon as I came out of the mountains, I heard from overseas Chinese friends that our country has become strong, and we are no longer oppressed. I was so happy!"
    The Chinese Red Cross's condolences to him, the money they sent him, and the warm greetings from some of our country's delegations visiting Japan were all deeply imprinted in his mind. He mentioned these things at the beginning. He also mentioned the help he received from overseas Chinese in Japan and from the Japanese people. He said, "The overseas Chinese, the Japanese five organizations, and the Japanese people are all good. They all spoke up for me. Many Japanese people came to see me, bringing me snacks and apples, and saying 'sorry,' and also saying they wanted to be friends with the Chinese people. When I went from Sapporo to Tokyo, many Japanese people went to the station to see me off. I know this wasn't for me, it was because our country is strong."
    When mentioning the Japanese government, Liu Lianren's mood immediately changed, saying, "I am very dissatisfied and unhappy." He said that when he was about to return home, the Japanese government sent him a sum of money and a letter. The people sent by the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government said to him, "This is just a small token, please accept it!" Liu Lianren said, "You just say 'a small token,' but you don't explain what it is for. I absolutely cannot accept your money. I didn't come to Japan to make money, you grabbed me here with your guns." Liu Lianren was right. The Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government must compensate Liu Lianren for all his spiritual and material losses. For this kind of atrocity committed by Japanese militarism in violation of international law and humanity, a formal apology must be made. It is absolutely not something that can be dealt with by carelessly stuffing a little money and writing a few hypocritical words.
    Liu Lianren said that when he boarded the ship, he was happy on the one hand, but on the other hand, he felt bad when he thought of the suffering he had endured in the past. When the ship approached the Tianjin Xingang dock, he saw thousands of people welcoming him at the dock. He was even more excited. He said, "I never dreamed that our country would be governed so well, I am so happy!" "I'd rather die than work for them"
    The excitement of the conversation had just sustained him, so when talking about the past, he did not show excessive sadness, but rather calmly described his experiences. One morning in the autumn of 1944, before he had eaten breakfast, as he was preparing to take fertilizer to the fields, the Japanese army grabbed him. He was taken to Qingdao, stayed there for seven days, and then was forced onto a ship and transported to Japan. There were eight hundred fellow sufferers on the same ship, two hundred of whom were sent to Hokkaido, and he was one of them. He was assigned to work as a laborer in a coal mine. He didn't get enough to eat, and he couldn't do the work. The Japanese foreman would hit him with the handle of a pickaxe. He thought, "I'd rather die than work for them, whether I starve to death or get beaten to death, it's all the same." One dark night, he saw that the gate had not been locked and escaped. That was at the end of July of the second year. He had worked in the coal mine for eight months.
    He wandered in the mountains for ten days, eating wild chives and mushrooms. His eyes were blurred with hunger, and his legs were swollen. He thought, "This must be the end of my life." He untied the straw rope around his waist and planned to hang himself, but the rope broke. "My life is not supposed to end here! I must live on!" He regained the courage to live and continued to wander in the mountains.
    Although it was far from people's homes, there were also cultivated fields in the mountains, and it was not difficult to encounter small shacks built by Japanese farmers in the fields. These small shacks saved his life. He found an iron kettle there, and from time to time he also found some matches, a little salt, and some farm tools. He could dig up some potatoes from the fields and boil them to eat.
    In this way, when the weather was not cold, he would carry the iron kettle in one hand and a wooden stick he had chopped from a tree in the other, hiding from people and guarding against "wild mountain cats," wandering around in the mountains.
    He often saw the sea. He thought: How great it would be to get on a boat, hoist a sail, cross the sea, and return to my hometown! But seeing the high waves and knowing that he couldn't sail a boat, he knew this was just wishful thinking.
    The hardest part was winter. The winters in Hokkaido were especially long. The severe cold and snow not only forced him to stop wandering, but he was also afraid that others would discover his footprints. So, before each winter came, he would use an iron pickaxe he found in the shack to dig himself a dugout. Here, he would store some potatoes and wild vegetables, spread out a straw mat he had found in the shack, wrap himself in a piece of sail he had picked up from the beach, and spend the entire winter hibernating.
    Hiding in the dugout for more than four months, after the weather warmed and the snow melted each year, he would crawl out of the dugout. He was always unable to walk. He would bask in the sun, slowly rubbing his legs, gradually regaining his ability to move, and then begin the next year's wandering.
    The leaves turned green and then yellow, the snow fell and then melted. In this way, he spent fourteen springs and autumns in foreign mountains and fields. In February of this year, he was discovered. Compatriots took him to a hotel. There were many words he had forgotten how to say. A kind compatriot from Shanxi accompanied him for two months, and he gradually regained his normal speaking ability. Of the many things he had talked about, the one he remembered most clearly was, "Our country has become strong."
    "Only the Communist Party can care for the working people like this"
    The day before, when Liu Lianren had not yet arrived in Tianjin, we had the opportunity to visit his family. Liu Lianren's wife, Zhao Yulan, is a simple working woman in her thirties. Talking about the misery and hardship of the family after Liu Lianren was taken away, she repeatedly used the back of her hand to rub her moist eyes. The old grandfather missed his son so much that he became ill. The old grandmother cried for her son and went blind in one eye. Liu Lianren's second and third brothers were working outside and could only take care of themselves. The fourth and fifth children were young. How could she, a woman, bear the burden of the family? Life was too difficult. Later, the family had no choice but to marry off the youngest aunt early in exchange for a few dou of grain.
    Liu Lianren's fourth brother, Liu Liandeng, also came from his hometown in Shandong. The year Liu Lianren was taken away, he was just a teenager. After Japan surrendered, before 1948, he joined the People's Liberation Army. In 1952, he was demobilized and returned to his hometown. Now he is the production team leader of an agricultural production cooperative. He said: The changes in his hometown in the past ten years were unimaginable to his eldest brother. Liu Liandeng talked about the government's care for his eldest brother and said, "In the old society, no one cared about the lives of ordinary people, and no one cared about those who were stranded abroad and couldn't return home. Only the People's China led by the Communist Party would care about the suffering of an ordinary working person like this."
    We also saw Liu Lianren's child, Liu Huanxin, who was born two months after Liu Lianren was taken away. He is now fourteen years old and studying in the fifth grade of elementary school. From the time he could remember at the age of five or six, his mother and grandmother often told him about his father being taken away. When his grandmother was dying more than two months ago, she kept talking about his father! His grandmother gave him two names, first "Pan'er" (Hope Son), and then "Xun'er" (Search Son). He said, "That means hoping for my dad to come back, searching for my dad to come back!"
    Now he has finally waited for his father. The Liu Lianren family is reunited. We wish his family eternal happiness and fulfillment in peaceful labor and in the great leap forward of the motherland.
    However, we cannot help but think of the many others who were abducted to Japan and whose whereabouts are still unknown. The struggle is not over, and we must hold Nobusuke Kishi accountable.

### “祖国强大了，我真高兴！”——访问刘连仁和他的家属

    “祖国强大了，我真高兴！”
    ——访问刘连仁和他的家属
    本报记者　刘仲平　石坚
    4月16日，在难胞刘连仁回到天津的第二天下午，我们访问了他，请他叙述了十四年的苦难经历。对于祖国的强盛的欢欣，通过他那乡音不改的语言叙述出来，更加吸引了我们。他不是一个传奇性的英雄，但从他身上我们可以充分感觉到中国劳动人民的坚韧不屈和顽强的生命力。
    “做梦也没想到国家治理成这样好！”
    刘连仁一开始就说：“我从山里出来，就听到华侨朋友告诉我说，我们国家强大了，我们不受压迫了，把我喜欢得不得了。”
    中国红十字总会对他的慰问、给他汇去的钱，一些到日本访问的我国代表团对他的亲切的慰问，都使他深深印在心里。他一开始就提到了这些。他也提到了旅日侨胞给他的帮助，日本人民给他的帮助。他说：“侨胞们、日本五团体、日本老百姓都好，他们都帮我说话。有很多日本老百姓来看我，给我送点心、送苹果，跟我说‘对不起’，还说要跟中国人交朋友。我从扎幌到东京的时候，也有很多日本人到车站去送我。我知道这不是为我，这是因为我们国家强大了。”
    提到日本政府，刘连仁情绪马上一转，说：“我非常不满意，不高兴。”他说，临回国的时候，日本政府给他送来一笔钱，还有一封信。日本岸信介政府派来的人跟他说：“这是小意思，收下吧！”刘连仁说：“你们光说‘小意思’，不说明白是怎么回事，我决不能收你们的钱。我不是为挣钱来到日本的，是你们用枪杆抓我来的。”刘连仁做得对，日本岸信介政府对于刘连仁一切精神上、物质上的损失必须给予赔偿。对于日本军国主义所犯的这种违反国际法规和人道的暴行，必须正式谢罪。这绝不是马马虎虎塞给一点钱，写两三句猫哭老鼠的话能够交代过去的。
    刘连仁说，他上了船一方面高兴，一方面想起过去受的罪，心里就不好受。当轮船靠近天津新港码头时，他看见成千的人在码头欢迎他，他更加激动了，他说：“我做梦也没想到咱们国家治理成这样了，我真高兴！”“不替他们干了，反正是个死”
    方才谈话的兴奋还支持着他，所以谈起过去时，他没有显示出过分的伤心，而是比较平静地叙述了他的遭遇。他是在1944年秋天的一个早上，他还没有吃早饭，正准备往地里送粪，在收拾车子的时候，日本军队就把他抓走了。他被押送到青岛，呆了七天，又被赶上轮船，运到了日本。同船的难友有八百人，其中二百人被送到北海道，他是其中的一个。他被分配到一个煤矿做劳工。吃不饱，干不动活，日本工头就拿镐把打。他想：“不是饿死，就得叫人揍死，不替他们干了，反正是个死。”他在一天黑夜里，看到大门还没落锁，逃出来了。那是第二年7月末，他在煤矿上已经干了八个月。
    在山上转了十天，吃的是野韭菜、山蘑菇，眼饿花了，腿浮肿了。他想：“该是我绝命的时候了”。他解下系在腰上的草绳打算上吊，可是绳子断了。“我命不该绝呀！活下去！”他又恢复了生的勇气，重新在山上流浪。
    虽然离人家很远，可是山里也垦有耕地，而且不难碰到日本农民在地里搭的小窝棚，这些小窝棚救了他的命。他在那里找到了一把铁壶，还不时地找到一些火柴、一点盐和一些农具。他可以从地里刨一些马铃薯来煮着吃了。
    就这样，天不冷的时候，他就一只手提着铁壶，一只手拿着从树上劈下来的木棒，躲着人，提防着“山猫野兽”，在山里到处转。
    他常常看到海。他想过：能坐上船，扯起一张帆，漂过海，回到老家去多好啊！可是看到浪头很高，自己又不会使船，他知道这不过是空想罢了。
    难过的是冬天。北海道的冬天又特别长，严寒和积雪不仅逼得他不能到处转，而且他也害怕别人发现脚印。所以每到冬天来临之前，他都用从小窝棚里找到的铁镐给自己刨一个地窨子，他在这里蓄藏上一些马铃薯、野菜，铺上从窝棚里找来的草席，裹上从海滩上拣来的一块船帆，整个冬天就穴居不出了。
    在地窨子里藏上四个多月，每年天暖雪化之后，他爬出窨子，他总是走不动路的。晒着太阳，慢慢揉着腿，他一点点恢复活动的能力，于是又开始第二年的流浪。
    树叶青了又黄，雪落了又化，就这样，他在异国山野里度过了十四个春秋。今年2月，他被人发现了。侨胞们把他接到旅馆里，有许多话他都忘记怎样说了，一位亲切的山西籍的侨胞，陪了他两个月，他才逐渐地恢复了正常的讲话能力。在谈过的许多话里，他记得最牢的是，“我们国家强大起来了”。
    “只有共产党才能这样关怀劳动人民”
    在前一天，当刘连仁还没有抵达天津的时候，我们还有机会访问了他的家属。刘连仁的妻子赵玉兰，是个三十多岁的质朴的劳动妇女。谈到刘连仁被抓走以后家里的凄惨和困苦情况，她不止一次地用手背去揉她那湿润的眼睛。老爷爷想儿子，想成了病，老奶奶哭儿子，哭瞎了一只眼睛，刘连仁的二弟、三弟那时候在外扛活，只能顾住自己的嘴，老四老五又小，一家的担子靠她一个妇女，怎么能担得起来。日子实在过得太困难了，后来，家里不得不把小姑姑过早地打发出嫁，换了几斗粮。
    刘连仁的四弟刘连登，也从山东老家赶来了。刘连仁被抓走的当年，他还是十几岁的小孩子。日本投降以后，1948年前，他参加了人民解放军，1952年复员回到家乡，现在是农业生产合作社的生产队长。他说：这十几年家乡的变化，是他大哥难以想像的。刘连登谈到政府对他大哥的关心时说：“旧社会老百姓的死活没人管，流落在外不能回家更没人管。只有共产党领导的人民中国，才会这样关怀一个普通劳动人民的苦难。”
    我们也看到了刘连仁被抓走以后两个月才生下来的他的孩子刘焕新。他已经满十四岁，在小学五年级念书。他从五、六岁能记事的时候起，母亲和祖母就常常给他讲他父亲被抓走的事。祖母在两个多月以前临死的时候，还不住地叨念他的父亲呢！祖母给他取过两个名字，先叫“盼儿”，后叫“寻儿”。他说：“这就是盼俺爸回来，寻俺爸回来的意思呗！”
    现在他终于盼到他父亲了。刘连仁一家团圆了。我们祝他一家在和平的劳动中，在祖国的大跃进中永远幸福美满。
    但是，我们不能不想到还有不少被掳到日本去而至今下落不明的人。斗争并没有结束，我们一定要向岸信介追究责任。
