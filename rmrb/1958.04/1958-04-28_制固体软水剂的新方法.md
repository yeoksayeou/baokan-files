    New Method for Making Solid Water Softener
    Locomotive boilers use solid water softeners to eliminate scale. The method of preparing water softener in various railway locomotive depots is to put four raw materials, namely caustic soda, sodium carbonate, sodium phosphate, and blood meal, into a pot, boil them over fire, and then cool them into solids. This preparation method takes a long time to boil, is slow to form the agent, consumes fuel, and the smell emitted during boiling is very unpleasant.
    During the rectification period, Zhang Maocai, a worker in charge of water softener distribution at the Majiaoba Locomotive Depot of the Chengdu Railway Administration, after painstaking research, created an advanced method of making water softener without heating and burning. This improves work efficiency by two times, the quality is good, and it can also save a lot of coal. The specific preparation method is to first dissolve caustic soda and blood meal in cold water, then mix them with sodium carbonate and sodium phosphate, and stir into a liquid. Put the solution into a mold, and after twelve hours of cooling and condensation into a solid, take it out to become a solid water softener.
    We would like to recommend this method to comrades who prepare water softeners nationwide, and you may wish to try it.

    制固体软水剂的新方法
    机车锅炉使用固体软水剂，是为了消除水锈。配制软水剂方法，各铁路机务段是把火碱、碳酸钠、磷酸钠和血料等四种原料装入锅内，经过加火煮沸，然后冷却凝成固体。这种配制方法，由于烧煮时间长，成剂很慢，并且耗费燃料，熬煮时冒出的臭味非常难闻。
    整改期间，成都铁路管理局马角坝机务段软水剂配发工张懋材同志，经过苦心钻研，创造出不用加热烧制软水剂的先进方法，提高工作效率两倍，质量又好，还可以节约大量煤炭。具体配制方法是先把火碱和血料加冷水溶化，然后和碳酸钠、磷酸钠混合在一起，搅拌成液体，把溶液放入药模中，经过十二小时冷凝成固体后，取出来就成为固体软水剂。
    我们特向全国软水剂配制工人同志推荐这个方法，不妨试用一下。
