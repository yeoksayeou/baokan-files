    Refuting the Absurdities of Anti-Party Elements
    ——On Feng Xuefeng's "Recollections of Lu Xun"
    Liu Shousong
    Precisely because Lu Xun was a great writer, thinker, and revolutionary, and enjoys an undying reputation and love among the Chinese people, many individualistic careerists, anti-Party elements, and counter-revolutionaries lurking in the revolutionary ranks often borrow Lu Xun's name when carrying out their heinous anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. Some even raise the banner of Lu Xun's "successor" in order to deceive the masses. Hu Feng and Feng Xuefeng are the most typical examples.
    Feng Xuefeng wrote many articles about Lu Xun, among which "Recollections of Lu Xun" occupies a particularly important position, and it has had a rather widespread and negative impact on readers. In this booklet, Feng Xuefeng tries his best to portray himself as someone who was in long-term contact with Lu Xun and had a significant influence on him, making it easy for people to mistake his lies for the truth. At the same time, this booklet is written in a seemingly cordial and gentle tone, and although it has the characteristic "obscurity for profundity" that Feng Xuefeng's articles have always had, it is still somewhat "persuasive."
    At the beginning of "Recollections of Lu Xun," Feng Xuefeng wrote: "One evening in December 1928, Rou Shi took me to see Mr. Lu Xun. From then on, I was close to Mr. Lu Xun until the day he passed away." In addition, in many places throughout the book, he repeatedly wrote statements like the following: "Probably because I liked to mention issues such as social consciousness and literature and art, and these were issues that Mr. Lu Xun liked to talk about at that time, he talked to me more and it was easier to relate to his own thoughts." "I could interject at any time, express my own opinions, and often divert his topic or even change his mood during the conversation." Examples like this are too numerous to mention. Feng Xuefeng's purpose is to deepen the reader's impression through this kind of shameless boasting: that he had "more frequent and closer contact" with Lu Xun, and that the reason Lu Xun's thought had such a brilliant development, and the reason he was able to become a great man of the Chinese cultural revolution during the Ten Years' Civil War, seems to be due to Feng Xuefeng. Therefore, if Lu Xun is great, then Feng Xuefeng is even greater than Lu Xun. Obviously, Feng Xuefeng wrote this booklet precisely to distort Lu Xun in order to elevate himself and to capitalize on it for his anti-Party activities.
    In order to achieve this goal, Feng Xuefeng put a lot of effort into writing this booklet. First of all, when discussing Lu Xun's early thought, he made an extremely inappropriate belittlement. The historical scope of "Recollections of Lu Xun" ranges from 1929 to October 1936, when Lu Xun died. Therefore, there is not much mention of Lu Xun's early thought; but in the few places where it is mentioned, he made serious distortions. He wrote:
    ...In the early stage, he started from the position of the petty bourgeoisie based on individualistic ideas, and at the same time, starting from the theory of evolution he recognized, he placed the main hope of the revolution on young people (mainly educated youth), taking young people as the main social force of revolution and all innovation movements, believing that the future would always be better than the past and the present, but his concept of what the future would be like was not clear, and his beliefs sometimes wavered.
    Similar words are also mentioned elsewhere in "Recollections of Lu Xun." We generally divide the course of development of Lu Xun's thought into two periods, and take 1927 as the dividing line between the early and late periods, which is correct. On this point, counter-revolutionary elements such as Hu Feng are trying their best to deny it, and they want to use this to deny the necessity of ideological remolding for intellectuals. But while we affirm that Lu Xun's thought has early and late periods, we should also point out that Lu Xun's early thought was not without development and change, and this development and change was closely related to the historical characteristics of the Chinese revolution.
    Comrade Qu Qiubai once discussed this in the "Preface to Selected Essays of Lu Xun": "Lu Xun's thought before the 'May Fourth' Movement was still based on the theory of evolution and individualism. He ardently hoped for young people, and he bravely attacked the zombie rule of the patriarchal society, demanding the liberation of individuality. However, he soon gradually realized the feudal hierarchy and the layers of exploitation in Chinese society. From 1924 to 1925, his 'Random Talks in Late Spring,' 'Casual Notes Under the Lamp,' 'Miscellaneous Memories' ('Grave'), and the entire 'Collection of Huagai,' especially the 'Continued Collection of Huagai' in 1926, all contained the flames of fierce attacks on class rule." This is a scientific argument summarizing Lu Xun's thought before 1927, which clearly points out that Lu Xun's early thought also had relatively significant changes and developments. This change and development was due to the influence of the Russian October Socialist Revolution and the New Democratic Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party after the "May Fourth" Movement, and it was also the "quantitative change" process before Lu Xun became a communist "qualitative change." Precisely because Lu Xun's early thought was not stagnant, but was basically in line with the pace of the Chinese people's revolution, he was able to hate the "familiar class" and "not regret its collapse" ("Two Hearts Collection": "Preface"), and his early creations and essays were able to be filled with such a thorough and uncompromising anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary spirit. This is a point that we must not ignore when studying Lu Xun's early thought.
    However, Feng Xuefeng, who styles himself as Lu Xun's "successor," deliberately distorted Lu Xun on this very point, and he tried his best to belittle the significance and value of Lu Xun's early thought and creations. On the one hand, this is the inevitable manifestation of his reactionary bourgeois literary and artistic viewpoint on Lu Xun issues. Since he believes that "the new literature of China after the 'May Fourth'" is only "a final, distant branch of the world's bourgeois democratic literature in the 18th and 19th centuries, with so-called critical realism and negative romanticism as its mainstream" ("Essays" Volume 1, p. 124), then he will definitely deny the relationship between the Chinese new literature and its pioneers' thought and the flesh and blood of the Chinese people's revolution. On the other hand, there is also an unspeakable attempt hidden in Feng Xuefeng's actions: he wants to attribute the development of Lu Xun's later thought to himself; the lower he belittles Lu Xun's early period, the greater his "merit" will be, and the more he can use it as capital for his anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. We must expose such a conspiracy here first.
    Even more serious is that, in order to achieve his goal, Feng Xuefeng also made unacceptably absurd interpretations of Lu Xun's later thought—especially Lu Xun's glorious literary activities during the entire League of Left-Wing Writers era.
    We know that the main reason why Lu Xun was able to become a communist in his later years and the founder of socialist realism literature in our country was due to the increasingly in-depth revolutionary struggle led by our Party and the education and enlightenment of Marxism-Leninism on him. The reason why Lu Xun is always worth learning from is that he witnessed the harsh facts of class struggle after 1927 and recognized the correctness and greatness of our Party, and that he earnestly studied Marxism-Leninism and used it as his ideological weapon for observing Chinese society and guiding revolutionary practice. In "Recollections of Lu Xun," Feng Xuefeng also occasionally touched on these points, but what he emphasized was Lu Xun's own "realistic fighting attitude," or, to put it more bluntly, Lu Xun's own "subjective fighting spirit." He wrote: "His (Lu Xun's) method of thinking is determined by his attitude of thinking, that is, the realistic fighting attitude, especially by his realistic fighting will, which is the same in both the early and late periods." He also wrote: "In the course of Mr. Lu Xun's development, he also encountered several crises that could have caused him to retreat into the 'palace of art' or the 'hall of academia'," but "what enabled him to quickly pull himself out even when he was deep in such a palace was still his own fighting will and sense of responsibility." Obviously, from Feng Xuefeng's point of view, it was not the revolutionary struggle led by the Party that was as fierce as a prairie fire, nor the Party's leadership and care for Lu Xun, nor the truth of Marxism-Leninism, but only Lu Xun's "own fighting will and sense of responsibility" or "active attitude and firm fighting will" that made him a great communist fighter and writer. Feng Xuefeng meant that the development of Lu Xun's later thought was only the result of Lu Xun's own struggle and exploration, and Feng Xuefeng himself was the only one who had a profound influence on Lu Xun's thought. Is it not clear to people what kind of goods Feng Xuefeng is selling and what kind of ghosts he is harboring here?
    Regarding the relationship between Lu Xun and the Party during the entire League of Left-Wing Writers period, and Lu Xun's position and role in the League of Left-Wing Writers, Feng Xuefeng's narrative in "Recollections of Lu Xun" is even more inconsistent with historical facts. He said: "At that time, the Party Central Committee in Shanghai not only lacked experience in literary and artistic struggles and literary and artistic creation issues, but also did not pay enough attention to them, and did not give us a clear direction." He also said: "At that time, as long as Mr. Lu Xun existed, the League of Left-Wing Writers would exist. As long as Mr. Lu Xun did not collapse, the League of Left-Wing Writers would not collapse. As long as Mr. Lu Xun did not withdraw from the League of Left-Wing Writers and did not give up leadership, the organization of the League of Left-Wing Writers and its activities and struggles could be sustained." He even said that the League of Left-Wing Writers at that time was "borrowing" Lu Xun's "position and reputation."
    This is a huge lie. However, this kind of lie cannot withstand the rebuttal of historical facts. As early as before the eve of the May Fourth Movement, Lu Xun said this: "If there is no torch in the future: I will be the only light. If there is a torch and the sun comes out, we will naturally disappear with heartfelt sincerity, not only without any resentment, but also praising this torch or sun, because it illuminates mankind, including me." ("Hot Wind": "Random Thoughts" 41) This is the sincere expectation of a great soul. And this expectation, after 1927, especially during the years 1930-36, should be said to have been fully realized in Lu Xun. However, he did not only "praise this torch or sun," but unreservedly merged all his light into this warm and brilliant sunlight, and contributed his share of light and heat to the sunlight's illumination of the earth. Needless to say, this "torch" or "sun" is our Party. The Party's care and love for Lu Xun and Lu Xun's consistent loyalty to the Party are the source of the immortal value of Lu Xun's later literary career. Therefore, placing Lu Xun above the Party like Feng Xuefeng, exaggerating Lu Xun's role excessively, and using Lu Xun to replace the Party's leadership can only be an insult and slander to Lu Xun, because he secretly extracts the noblest and greatest aspect of Lu Xun's spirit.
    Was the Party Central Committee in Shanghai at that time really "not only lacking experience in literary and artistic struggles and literary and artistic creation issues, but also not paying enough attention to them" as Feng Xuefeng said? This is also a completely anti-Party element's slanderous words that distort the facts. Looking at the development history of modern revolutionary literature in China, it has always occurred and developed under the leadership and care of the Party. As early as 1923, when the Party was just established, it attached importance to literary undertakings as an organic component of the entire revolutionary cause, and the Party required literature to serve the revolutionary struggle. The articles by comrades Deng Zhongxia, Yun Daiying, Xiao Chunu, etc., published in "Chinese Youth" at that time are clear proof. Their opinions had a profound influence on the beginning of the revolutionary literary movement in 1926. The development of the proletarian revolutionary literary movement in 1928 was carried out under the leadership of the Party. At that time, almost all the important literary and artistic groups that advocated revolutionary literature (such as the Creation Society and the Sun Society) had Party members participating in and leading them. The League of Left-Wing Writers, established in Shanghai in March 1930, was an organization of revolutionary writers under the leadership of the Party. The League of Left-Wing Writers at that time was a component of the Chinese Left-Wing Cultural League (referred to as the Cultural League), and the Cultural League was a cultural organization directly led by our Party. Therefore, the Party not only gave deep attention to the League of Left-Wing Writers, but also gave specific planning and leadership. Leaving aside other things, is Comrade Qu Qiubai's personal participation in the leadership work of the League of Left-Wing Writers not a definite proof of the Party's leadership of the League of Left-Wing Writers? Did Comrade Qu Qiubai lack experience in guiding literary and artistic struggles and literary and artistic creation, and did he not pay enough attention to the League of Left-Wing Writers and the proletarian revolutionary literary movement it led?
    Here, I would also like to focus on the relationship between Comrade Qu Qiubai and Lu Xun and the great influence he had on Lu Xun. According to Comrade Yang Zhihua's recollection, when Comrade Qu Qiubai lived in Rizhao Lane in Shanghai in 1933, Lu Xun went to see them almost every day, and "talked with Comrade Qu Qiubai about politics, current affairs, literature and art, and was so happy that he forgot to return," "They both abandoned their personal interests and united closely together for the revolution, fighting shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy." ("How the Preface to Selected Essays of Lu Xun was Produced," "Language Learning," January 1958) The influence of Comrade Qu Qiubai on Lu Xun and their fighting friendship can be clearly seen from the above few words.
    It is not difficult to understand that it was precisely because of the Party's leadership that the League of Left-Wing Writers was able to persist in its work in the face of the layers of encirclement of white terror; it was precisely because of the Party's leadership that the League of Left-Wing Writers was able to strike at all kinds of enemies on the literary and artistic ideological front; it was precisely because of the Party's leadership that the League of Left-Wing Writers made great achievements in literary and artistic theory and creation; and it was also precisely because of the Party's leadership that Lu Xun made outstanding battles during the League of Left-Wing Writers period, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, he became "a great man of the Chinese cultural revolution." The iron facts placed in the history of modern literature, how can Feng Xuefeng cover them up with one hand!
    On the one hand, Feng Xuefeng placed the relationship between Lu Xun and the Party in an extremely inappropriate position, and on the other hand, he spared no effort to exaggerate the "close" relationship between himself and Lu Xun. When reading this booklet, people will naturally have such a feeling: the reason why the League of Left-Wing Writers achieved victory in such a difficult environment was only because of Lu Xun's leadership (of course, Lu Xun's important contribution to the League of Left-Wing Writers and proletarian revolutionary literature should be given sufficient attention); and the reason why Lu Xun was able to lead the League of Left-Wing Writers was because Feng Xuefeng was close to him. In this way, Feng Xuefeng not only placed Lu Xun above the Party, but also placed himself above the Party. And this is the most real purpose of Feng Xuefeng writing this booklet "Recollections of Lu Xun."
    In order to defend our Party's strong leadership in literary and artistic undertakings, and also to carry forward Lu Xun's great revolutionary spirit, it is necessary for us to thoroughly expose the absurdities of the anti-Party elements!

    斥反党者的谰言
    ——评冯雪峰：“回忆鲁迅”
    刘绶松
    正因为鲁迅是伟大的文学家、思想家和革命家，鲁迅在我国人民当中享有永不雕落的荣誉和爱戴，所以有不少的个人主义野心家、反党分子以及暗藏在革命阵营中的反革命分子，在他们进行反党反社会主义的罪恶活动的时候，往往要假借鲁迅的名义，有的甚至于打起了鲁迅“继承人”的招牌，以便蒙蔽群众的耳目。胡风和冯雪峰就是最典型的例子。
    冯雪峰写过不少有关鲁迅的文章，其中“回忆鲁迅”占着颇为重要的位置，它在读者当中发生了相当广泛的恶劣影响。在这本小册子里，冯雪峰竭力把自己装扮成一个长期接近鲁迅并对鲁迅有过重大影响的人，人们很容易把他的谎言当成了实话。同时，这本小册子又是用貌似亲切、委婉的笔调写下的，虽然有着冯雪峰的文章所一贯具有的那种“晦涩为深”的特点，但多少还有一点“娓娓动人”。
    在“回忆鲁迅”的开头，冯雪峰就写道：“1928年12月的一天晚上，柔石带我去见了鲁迅先生，从此我就跟鲁迅先生接近，一直到他逝世之日为止。”此外，他还在全书的很多地方，不厌重复地写着如下一类的话：“大概因为我喜欢提到社会意识和文艺等问题，而这些问题是鲁迅先生那时候最喜欢谈的，所以就跟我谈得多一些，并且也更容易联系到他自己的思想情况了。”“我能够随时插进话去，讲自己的意见，往往能够转移他的话题，或甚至转移谈话时的他的心情。”这样的例子，实在是举不胜举。冯雪峰的目的，是想通过这一类恬不知羞地吹嘘自己的话，来加深读者这样的印象：他和鲁迅有着“更频繁更亲近的接触”，鲁迅的思想之所以有着那样光辉的发展，之所以能够在十年内战当中成为中国文化革命的伟人，好像应该归功于冯雪峰似的，因此，如果说鲁迅是伟大的，那么，冯雪峰就比鲁迅更为伟大。很显明地，冯雪峰写这样一本小册子，其目的正是为了歪曲鲁迅来抬高自己，为自己的反党活动作资本。
    为了达到这样一种目的，冯雪峰在写作这个小册子时是煞费了苦心的。首先，在论述鲁迅前期思想的时候，他就作了极不应有的贬抑。“回忆鲁迅”所追叙的历史范围，是从1929年到1936年10月鲁迅逝世时为止。因此，关于鲁迅前期思想，触及的地方是并不很多的；但就在很少的提到的地方，他就进行了严重的歪曲。他写道：
    ……在前期，他从建立在个人主义思想基础上的小资产阶级的立场出发，同时又从他所承认的进化论出发，把革命的主要希望寄在青年（主要是知识青年）身上，以青年为革命和一切革新运动的主要的社会力量，相信将来总比过去和现在好，而将来究竟如何呢，他的观念却并不明确，他的信念有时就要动摇。
    类似这样的话，在“回忆鲁迅”中其他地方也还提到过。我们一般将鲁迅思想的发展历程分为前后二期，而把1927年作为前后期划分的界线，这是没有错的。在这一点上，反革命分子胡风等是竭力加以否定的，他们想以此来否定知识分子思想改造的必要性。但是我们肯定鲁迅思想有前后期的区分，同时还应该指出鲁迅前期的思想也不是没有发展和变化，而这个发展和变化正是和中国革命的历史特点有着密切联系的。
    瞿秋白同志在“鲁迅杂感选集序言”中，曾经这样论述过：“鲁迅在‘五四’前的思想，进化论和个性主义还是他的基本。他热烈的希望着青年，他勇猛的袭击着宗法社会的僵尸统治，要求个性的解放。可是，不久他就渐渐的了解到封建的等级制度和中国社会里的层层压榨。1924—25年，他的‘春末闲谈’，‘灯下漫笔’，‘杂忆’（‘坟’），以及整部的“华盖集”，尤其是1926的‘华盖集续编’，都包含着猛烈的攻击阶级统治的火焰。”这是对于1927年以前鲁迅思想的概括的科学的论断，它分明地指出了鲁迅前期的思想也有着比较显著的变化和发展。这一变化和发展，是受了俄国十月社会主义革命和“五四”以后的由中国共产党所领导的新民主主义革命的影响的缘故，也是鲁迅在成为共产主义者这一“质变”之前的“量变”的过程。正因为鲁迅前期的思想不是停滞不前，而是与中国人民革命的步法基本一致的，所以他才能够憎恶他所“熟识的本阶级”而“毫不可惜它的溃灭”（“二心集”：“序言”），而他的前期的创作和杂感也才能够充满着那样彻底的不妥协的反帝反封建的革命精神。这是我们研究鲁迅前期思想所决不可忽视的一点。
    但是自封为鲁迅“继承人”的冯雪峰却正好在这一点上对鲁迅进行了恶意歪曲，他竭力贬低了鲁迅前期思想、创作的意义和价值。这一方面是他的反动的资产阶级文艺观点在有关鲁迅问题上必然要有的表现，他既然认为“中国‘五四’后的新文学”只是“十八、九世纪那以所谓批判的现实主义和否定的浪漫主义为其主流的世界资产阶级民主文学之一个最后的遥远的支流”（“论文集”第一卷一二四页），那他就一定会否认中国新文学及其先驱者的思想和中国人民革命的血肉相连的关系。另一方面，这里也包藏着冯雪峰的一个不可告人的企图：他是想把鲁迅后期思想的发展归功于他自己；他愈把鲁迅前期贬抑得低，那么他的“功劳”也就愈大，愈可据以作为他的反党反社会主义的资本。这样一个阴谋诡计，是我们在这儿不能不首先揭露出来的。
    更为严重的是，冯雪峰为了达到他的这个目的，关于鲁迅后期思想——特别是鲁迅在整个左联时代的光芒万丈的文学活动，也作了令人难以容忍的荒谬的解释。
    我们知道，鲁迅在后期之所以能够成为一个共产主义者，成为我国社会主义现实主义文学的奠基人，最主要地是由于我们党所领导的日益深入发展的革命斗争以及马克思列宁主义对于他的教育和启发。鲁迅之所以永远值得我们学习，是由于他目睹了1927年后严峻的阶级斗争的事实而认识到我们党的正确和伟大，是由于他认真学习了马克思列宁主义，把它作为自己观察中国社会和指导革命实践的思想武器。在“回忆鲁迅”中，冯雪峰也偶然涉及到这些地方，但他所着重强调的则是鲁迅自己的“现实主义的战斗的态度”，说得更直截一些，就是鲁迅自己的“主观战斗精神”。他写道：“他（按指鲁迅）的思想方法决定于他的思想态度，即现实主义的战斗的态度，尤其决定于他的现实的战斗意志，这是前期和后期都相同的。”他又写道：“在鲁迅先生的发展的途中，也遇到过几次危机，很可能使他退隐于‘艺术之宫’或‘学术的殿堂’里去”，但“使他在深入这样的宫殿的时候也很快就自己拔出来的，仍旧是他自己的斗争意志和责任感。”十分明显，从冯雪峰看来，不是党所领导的如火燎原的革命斗争，不是党对于鲁迅的领导和关怀，也不是马克思列宁主义的真理，而只是鲁迅“自己的斗争意志和责任感”或“主动的态度和坚决的战斗意志”，才使他成为伟大的共产主义的战士和作家的。冯雪峰的意思是：鲁迅后期思想的发展，只是鲁迅自己战斗和探索的结果，而冯雪峰本人呢，则是对鲁迅思想唯一的具有深刻影响的人。冯雪峰在这里卖的什么货色，怀的什么鬼胎，人们不是看得一清二楚了吗？
    关于鲁迅在整个左联时期和党的关系，以及鲁迅在左联中的地位和作用，冯雪峰在“回忆鲁迅”中的叙述，是更不符合历史事实的。他说：“那时候在上海的党中央对于文艺斗争和文艺创作问题，不仅缺少经验，并且关心是很不够的，同时也没有给我们以明确的方向。”又说：“在那时候，只要有鲁迅先生存在，左联就存在。只要鲁迅先生不垮，左联就不会垮。只要鲁迅先生不退出左联，不放弃领导，左联的组织和它的活动与斗争就能够坚持。”他甚至于还说，当时的左联，是在“借用”鲁迅的“地位与名誉”。
    这真是天大的谎语。然而这种谎语是经不住历史事实的反驳的。远在五四运动前夕，鲁迅就说过这样的话：“此后如竟没有炬火：我便是唯一的光。倘若有了炬火，出了太阳，我们自然心悦诚服的消失，不但毫无不平，而且还要随喜赞美这炬火或太阳，因为他照了人类，连我都在内。”（“热风”：“随感录”四十一）这是一个伟大心灵的由衷的期望。而这个期望，在1927年以后，特别是在1930——36的这几年间，在鲁迅，应当说是完全实现了的。不过他不只是“随喜赞美这炬火或太阳”，而是把自己的全部光亮毫无保留地汇合在这温煦、灿烂的阳光里，为阳光的普照大地而发出自己的一分光和热来。不用说，这“炬火”或“太阳”就是我们的党。党对于鲁迅的关怀爱护与鲁迅对于党的始终如一的忠诚，是鲁迅后期文学事业的不朽价值所由产生的源泉。因此，像冯雪峰那样地把鲁迅摆在党的上面，把鲁迅的作用过份夸大，用鲁迅来代替党的领导，那只能是对于鲁迅的侮辱和诬蔑，因为他偷偷地抽掉了鲁迅精神的最崇高最伟大的一面。
    当时在上海的党中央，真的像冯雪峰所说“对于文艺斗争和文艺创作问题，不仅缺少经验，并且关心是很不够的”吗？这也完全是反党分子歪曲事实的谰言。从中国现代革命文学的发展历史来看，它是一直在党的领导和关怀之下发生和发展起来的。远在1923年，当党成立不久的时候，就把文学事业当成整个革命事业的有机组成部分而加以重视，党要求文学服务于革命斗争。那时发表在“中国青年”上的邓中夏、恽代英、萧楚女等同志的文章，就是明证。他们的意见对于1926年革命文学运动的开始倡导发生了深刻的影响。1928年无产阶级革命文学运动的展开，是在党的领导下进行的。当时提倡革命文学的几个重要文艺团体（如创造社、太阳社等）差不多都有党员参加和领导。1930年3月在上海成立的左翼作家联盟，更是党领导下的革命作家的组织。当时的左联是中国左翼文化总同盟（简称文总）的一个组成部分，而文总则是我们党直接领导下的文化团体。因此，党对于左联不仅给予了深切的关注，而且还给予了具体的策划和领导。别的不说，瞿秋白同志的亲自参加左联领导工作，难道还不是党领导左联的一个确切证明？难道瞿秋白同志还缺乏指导文艺斗争和文艺创作的经验，他还没有足够地关心左联及其所领导的无产阶级革命文学运动？
    在这里，我还想着重地提一下瞿秋白同志和鲁迅的关系以及他给予鲁迅的巨大影响。据杨之华同志的回忆，当1933年瞿秋白同志住在上海日照里的时候，鲁迅几乎每天都去看他们，和瞿秋白同志“谈论政治、时事、文艺各方面的事情，乐而忘返”，“他们两人都丢开了个人的利益，为革命紧紧地团结在一起，肩并肩地对共同的敌人战斗。”（“鲁迅杂感选集序言是怎样产生的”，“语文学习”1958年1月号）瞿秋白同志对于鲁迅的影响和他们之间的战斗的友谊，从以上寥寥几句话中是可以分明看得出来的。
    不难明了，正是因为有了党的领导，所以左联才能够在白色恐怖的层层包围中一直坚持自己的工作；正是因为有了党的领导，所以左联才能够在文艺思想战线上给各式各样的敌人以打击；正是因为有了党的领导，所以左联在文艺理论和创作上都有了巨大收获；同时也正因为有了党的领导，所以鲁迅在左联时期作出了出色的战斗，正如毛泽东同志所说的，他成了“中国文化革命的伟人”。摆在现代文学史上的铁的事实，岂是冯雪峰所一手掩盖得住的！
    冯雪峰一方面把鲁迅和党的关系摆在极不恰当的位置上，另一方面又不遗余力地渲染自己和鲁迅之间的“亲密”的关系。读这本小册子的时候，人们很自然地会产生这样一种感觉：左联之所以在那样艰难的环境里取得胜利，只是因为有了鲁迅的领导（当然，鲁迅对左联和无产阶级革命文学的重要贡献，应该予以足够的重视）；而鲁迅之所以能够领导左联，则是因为冯雪峰和他接近的缘故。这样，冯雪峰就不仅把鲁迅摆在党的上面，同时也将自己摆在党的上面了。而这，就是冯雪峰写作“回忆鲁迅”这本小册子的最真实的目的。
    为了保卫我们党在文艺事业上的坚强的领导，也为了发扬鲁迅的伟大的革命精神，我们有必要彻底揭穿反党者的谰言！
