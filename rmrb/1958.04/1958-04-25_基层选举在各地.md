Grassroots Elections Across Various Regions

    An Unprecedented Happy Event in Thousands of Years
    The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Deqin and Zhongdian in the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Bijiang, Fugong, and Gongshan in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Lushui, and Gengma Dai and Wa Autonomous County in the Lincang Prefecture have decided to carry out general elections this year. This is an unprecedented happy event for the people of all ethnic groups in these regions in thousands of years.
    In the past, it was fundamentally impossible for the people of various ethnic groups in the border regions to elect people they were satisfied with and trusted to handle affairs for their own ethnic groups. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups elected their own representatives through people's representative conferences of various ethnic groups and circles. At present, under the leadership of the Party, the people of various ethnic groups in these regions have completed peaceful consultation on land reform, changing some unreasonable systems that have existed for thousands of years. The awareness of the people of all ethnic groups has greatly increased, and the political and economic conditions have been further consolidated. Now, conditions are ripe to adopt a more complete People's Congress system to carry out general elections. After research and decision by the Provincial People's Committee, election work will be carried out in these areas this year.

    Production and Elections Truly Do Not Interfere With Each Other
    Agricultural cooperative members in the M窝 Township, Jingxi Mining Area, Beijing, truly achieved a situation where production and elections did not interfere with each other during the tense season of agricultural production.
    The cooperative members were discussing the significant meaning of the general election while engaging in production, seizing every spare moment to deliberate on representative candidates. Each production team, gathering the opinions of the cooperative members, put forward their team's list of representative candidates. The Township People's Committee, in accordance with the opinions of the voters, adopted a "flowing" method of voting, where people could vote and leave.
    Yangjia Village and Zhangjia Village started voting at six o'clock on the morning of the election day. Those who came to participate in the election included shepherds, livestock drivers, drilling team workers, and agricultural cooperative members. Within two hours, both villages had completed all the voting. On the same day, after dinner, the village held a meeting to announce the list of elected Township People's Congress representatives and summarized the production work of the first quarter. Cooperative member Yang Junrong said, "This year's election method is really good; it truly ensures that production and elections do not interfere with each other."

    Desirable Candidates Were Proposed
    Liang Gen is the director of the First Residents' Committee of Xiaomei Street in Guangzhou City. Almost everyone in this electoral district knows him. He is a tricycle worker who is very concerned about the affairs of the neighborhood residents. He knows who is sick and needs care, who lacks cotton clothes when the weather is cold, and actively helps others solve their difficulties. His family's economic situation is not wealthy, but several times, for the sake of public welfare, he would rather earn less money to handle the affairs of the masses well. He always takes the lead in working hard to set up people-run schools and clinics in the neighborhood, and he completes the tasks assigned to him tirelessly, without complaining. The voters have long seen and remembered this spirit of selfless service to the masses.
    Before the preliminary list of representative candidates was announced, the voters had already kept him in mind. Everyone hoped that his name would be on the list of jointly nominated representative candidates. Some voters even went everywhere to promote, discuss, and compare with others, feeling very anxious. Some people even wanted to inquire about information from the comrades of the election work team, but those comrades only told them what kind of people should be elected as representatives, but they could not find out who it would be. Although the voters knew that if their desired candidate was not mentioned in the joint nomination, they could propose their own favorite person, they were always worried in those days that the candidates would not meet their expectations.
    On the 8th of this month, the list of jointly nominated candidates was announced at the voters' meeting. As expected, Liang Gen's name was on the list. Everyone felt as if a weight had been lifted from their minds, saying, "We really got our favorite person nominated."

    A Debate on Proposing Candidates
    Citizens of Liushu Township, Panshi County, Jilin Province, engaged in a debate when deliberating on proposing candidates for the Township People's Congress.
    In the first electoral district (Nangang Village) of this township, some people initially proposed Yang Shikui as a candidate. After several discussions, the majority of the masses supported Ma Zhancai because Ma Zhancai is selfless, has a firm stance, and dares to fight against landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries; he can bring the opinions of the masses to the higher levels and can also effectively implement the tasks proposed by the higher levels. At the meeting, many people said to Yang Shikui's face that Yang Shikui is two-faced, always laughing it off when things happen, and not serious about doing things; he also attaches too much importance to personal interests. For example, when making carrying poles for the cooperative, others could make four a day, but Yang Shikui said he could only make two, so everyone disagreed with electing him. In the fifth electoral district, some people initially proposed Li Jiang as a candidate, but after presenting the facts and comparing the conditions, most voters believed that Li Jiang did not discuss matters with the masses, issued commands forcibly, was unfair in handling affairs, favored relatives and friends, and took advantage of opportunities. He himself used the cooperative's cart to haul 7,000 bundles of foreign grass without paying work points. Such a person is not worthy of being a representative. People nominated Teng Yu as a candidate because Teng Yu has no selfish motives, is willing to work for everyone, and also has the ability to handle affairs. At the same time, people also pointed out that Teng Yu's work had not been as active as before after his father died and his mother became ill, reminding him that he should pay attention to correcting himself, but this did not affect him being a representative candidate.

    A "New Cooperative Member" Was Elected as a Representative
    The members of the Duola Cooperative in Zhongguomi Township, Gonghe County, Qinghai Province, unanimously passed the resolution at the voters' meeting to elect the cadre sent down to the countryside, Cai Rang, as a representative to the Township People's Congress.
    Why did Cai Rang receive everyone's praise and commendation? Cai Rang is a Tibetan, 26 years old this year. He returned to the cooperative from the government agency last year when cadres were sent down to the countryside. Over the past few years, under the cultivation and education of the Party, he joined the Communist Youth League. He had never attended school before, but now he has an elementary school education.
    Originally, there was no one in the cooperative who could read Chinese, and there were many difficulties in the work. Last year, when the cooperative members heard the news that Cai Rang had been sent down to their cooperative, they jumped up with joy. Indeed, Cai Rang did not disappoint the cooperative members. After returning to the cooperative, he performed very well. He was active in labor, took the lead in water conservancy, eliminating the "four pests," leading night schools and newspaper reading groups, helping resident cadres with translation, understanding the ideological situation of the cooperative members, and helping the cooperative members, all of which he did very well. Recently, he was elected as the deputy leader of the cooperative's mountain area planning group. He cares about the cooperative, is active in labor, and is responsible in his work, so the masses elected him as a representative to the Township People's Congress. (Attached picture)

### 基层选举在各地

    基层选举在各地
    千百年没有的大喜事
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州、迪庆藏族自治州的德钦、中甸、怒江傈僳族自治州的碧江、福贡、贡山部分地区，泸水及临沧专区的耿马傣族佧佤族自治县，决定在今年开展普选工作。这是这些地区各族人民千百年没有的大喜事。
    过去，边疆各族人民要选出自己满意信任的人为自己民族办事，是根本不可能的。解放后，各族人民在党的领导下，曾经通过各族各界人民代表会议形式选出过自己的代表。目前，这些地区各族人民在党领导下已完成和平协商土地改革，改变了各族人民几千年来的一些不合理制度。各族人民觉悟大大提高，政治经济条件更加巩固。现在已有条件采用更完备的人民代表大会制度来进行普选。经省人民委员会研究决定，今年在这些地区开展选举工作。
    生产选举真正两不误
    北京京西矿区煤窝乡的农业社社员，在农业生产的紧张季节中，真正作到了生产和选举两不误。
    社员们都是一面生产，一面讨论普选的重大意义，抓紧空隙时间酝酿代表候选人。由各个生产队集中社员的意见，提出了自己队的代表候选人名单。乡人民委员会依照选民的意见，采取了“流水式”的随投随走办法，进行投票。
    杨家村和张家庄在选举那天早晨六点开始投票。前来参加选举的有放羊的牧人，赶牲口的把式，钻探队的工人和农业社社员。两个小时里面，两个村就全部结束投票。当天晚饭以后，村里开会公布了当选的乡人民代表大会代表名单，并且在会上总结了第一季度生产工作。社员杨俊荣说：“今年选举办法真好，真正是生产、选举两不误。”
    提出了可心的候选人
    梁根是广州市小梅街第一居民委员会主任，在这个选区里，差不多没有一个人不认识他。他是一个三轮车工人，对街坊群众的事情十分关怀。街坊上，谁病了没人照顾，谁天冷缺棉衣，他都知道，并积极帮助别人解决困难。他的家庭经济并不富裕，但好几次为了办公益事业，他宁可少去赚一些钱，而去把群众的事办好。街道里办民校、办诊疗所，他总是带头苦干，任务交给他，他就废寝忘餐地去完成，从不闹情绪。这种忘我地为群众服务的精神，选民早就看在眼里，记在心头。
    在没有公布代表候选人初步名单以前，选民们早已把他记在心里。大家都希望在联合提名的代表候选人中，有他的名字。有的选民甚至到处去宣传和找别人商量、评比，心里很紧张。有的人还想从选举工作队的同志那里打听风声，但那些同志只告诉他们应该选什么样的人当代表，至于到底是什么人却打听不到。虽然选民知道：如果联合提名未提到他们的满意人，选民还可以另外提出自己的心上人，可是那几天，选民们总是耽心候选人不合自己的心意。
    本月8日，选民大会上公布了联合提名的候选人名单，里面果然有梁根的名字，大家就像心里放下了一块石块，说：“真的提中了我们的心上人”。
    提候选人的一场辩论
    吉林省磐石县柳树乡的公民们在酝酿提出乡人民代表候选人时，展开了一场辩论。
    这个乡的第一选区（南岗屯）开始有些人提杨士魁做候选人，经过几次讨论后，多数群众拥护马占才，因为：马占才大公无私、立场稳，敢和地主、富农、反革命分子作斗争；能把群众的意见带上去，也能把上边提出的任务很好地布置下来。在会上不少人当着杨士魁的面说：杨士魁两面光，遇事哈哈一笑，办事不认真；还有个人利益看得太重。比如给合作社做扁担，别人一天能做四个，杨士魁说只能做两个，所以大家不同意选他。第五选区开始有的人提出李江为候选人，但经过摆事实，比条件，大多数选民都认为李江有事不和群众商量，强迫命令，办事不公，偏向亲友，占尖取巧，自己套社里大车拉七千梱洋草不掏工分，这样的人不配作代表。人们都提名要滕玉作候选人，因为滕玉没有私弊，肯为大家办事，也有办事能力，同时人们也指出滕玉在他父亲死了和母亲有病以后，工作不像从前那样积极了，提醒他应该注意改正，但这并不影响他做为代表候选人。
    “新社员”当选了代表
    青海省共和县中郭密乡多拉社的社员们在选民大会上一致通过下放干部才让为乡人民代表大会的代表。
    才让为什么会得到人人夸奖和个个赞扬呢？才让是藏民，今年二十六岁，去年干部下放的时候，才从机关回社里当社员。几年来，在党的培养教育下，他加入了共青团，过去没有念过书的他，已经具有了高小文化程度。
    原来社里没有一个识汉文的人，工作中困难很多，去年社员们听到才让下放到他们社的消息后，都高兴的跳了起来。的确才让没有辜负社员的希望，他回社以后，表现很好，劳动积极，带头搞水利、除“四害”、领导夜校和读报组工作，帮助驻社干部翻译，了解社员思想情况，帮助社员等，都做出了很好的成绩。最近他被选为社里山区规划小组的付组长。他对社关心，劳动积极，工作负责，所以群众选他当乡人民代表。（附图片）
    在普选中（速写）  邵宇作
    北京西单区学院胡同普选工作组召开的酝酿街道代表候选人的会议上，十三居民委员会的代表提出马友良同志。十一居民委员会的代表王碧秋（右第二人）不了解马友良的情况，她散会后去找认识马友良同志的李毅夫（右第一人）、郭元成（右第三人）、白淑敏（右第四人）等了解情况。　　　　　　　　张彬摄　（新华社稿）
