　　Planting Experimental Plots Sees New Development
　　Hong'an County Has Experimental Plots for Every Task, Every Cadre Has an Experimental Plot

　　(Reported by our Wuhan correspondent Fang Di): The current situation in rural Hong'an County is this: every task has an "experimental plot," and every cadre has an "experimental plot." This is the result of a series of new developments in the county's cadre planting of "experimental plots."

　　Last year, the "experimental plots" planted by cadres in Hong'an County were limited to several major agricultural crops. The specific method was "one person one plot" or "several people share a plot." Through this plot, they participated in production and led production. Starting last winter, the "experimental plots" planted by cadres in Hong'an County have developed to a newer stage. This new development is manifested in: First, the number of cadres planting "experimental plots" has increased from about 2,000 to more than 8,000; second, a large number of large-area "experimental plots" have emerged, namely "high-yield fields" and "high-yield areas"; third, there are also "experimental plots" in diversified operations; fourth, some small-area "experimental plots" have begun to conduct some scientific research-oriented experiments to create conditions for tapping new potential for increased production. According to statistics, the total area of "experimental plots" for summer crops in the county, including "high-yield fields" and "high-yield areas," has reached 59,000 mu, and there are about 200,000 mu for autumn crops; there are also many "experimental plots" in diversified operations.

　　The new development of "experimental plots" planted by cadres in Hong'an County is also manifested in: cadres going down to the fields wearing straw sandals, inspecting production with farm tools; going to participate in production wherever there are production difficulties; going to participate in whatever work no one is doing; taking the lead in laboring whenever commune members are unwilling to labor; and working together with whoever is unwilling to go to work. They call this practice "going wherever there is no leap (forward)." This is actually a kind of mobile "experimental plot," which has a great role in promoting cadres to further improve their work style, more broadly connect with the masses, more frequently participate in labor, and more comprehensively lead production. In addition, many cadres have also implemented "learning whatever they do and having whatever tools they use," which is also a development of the "experimental plot." The result of these practices is that cadres not only have their own "experimental plots" in leading various rural productions, but also have "experimental plots" in leading various rural works.

　　After realizing that every task has an "experimental plot" and every cadre has an "experimental plot," cadres in Hong'an County have taken another leap forward on the road of being both red and expert in the past few months. Generally, they have achieved "cadres becoming peasantized, life becoming mass-oriented, and labor becoming regularized," leading and helping the masses solve many various difficulties related to production and work, and are deeply welcomed and loved by the masses.

    种试验田有新发展
    红安县样样工作有试验田，个个干部有试验田
    本报武汉讯　记者方堤报道：当前的红安县农村中已经出现如下情况：样样工作有“试验田”，个个干部有“试验田”。这是干部种“试验田”在这个县又有一系列新发展的结果。
    去年，红安县干部种“试验田”是局限在几种主要农业作物方面的，其具体作法是“一人一块田”或“几人共块田”，通过这块田来参加生产、领导生产。从去冬开始，红安县干部种“试验田”又向着更新的阶段发展了。这种新发展表现为：一、种“试验田”的干部由原来的约二千人增加到八千多人；二、出现了大批大面积的“试验田”，即“丰产畈”和“丰产区”；三、多种经营方面也有了“试验田”；四、部分小面积的“试验田”已开始作些科学研究性的试验，为挖掘新的增产潜力创造条件。据统计，全县夏收作物方面的“试验田”，包括“丰产畈”和“丰产区”，总面积共达五万九千亩，秋收作物方面有二十万亩左右；在多种经营方面的“试验田”也不少。
    红安县干部种“试验田”的新发展还表现为：干部下畈穿草鞋，检查生产带农具；哪里生产有困难，就到哪里参加生产；哪种活路无人作，就到哪种活路上去参加生产；哪个时候社员不愿劳动，就在哪个时候带头劳动；哪种人不愿出工，就和哪种人一块出工。他们把这种作法叫作“哪里不跃（进）哪里去”。这实际上是一种流动的“试验田”，对促使干部进一步改进作风，更广泛地联系群众，更经常地参加劳动，和更全面地领导生产，都有极大的作用。此外，许多干部还实行了“干什么就学什么，作什么就有什么（工具）”，这也是“试验田”的一种发展。这些作法的结果是：干部不仅在领导农村各项生产中有自己的“试验田”，领导农村各项工作也有“试验田”了。
    实现样样工作有“试验田”，个个干部有“试验田”后，几个月来红安县干部在又红又专的道路上又向前跃进了一步，一般都已经作到“干部农民化，生活群众化，劳动经常化”，领导和帮助群众解决许多各种各样的有关生产、工作的困难问题，深受群众欢迎和爱戴。
