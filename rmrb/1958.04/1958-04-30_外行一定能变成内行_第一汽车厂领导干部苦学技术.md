    Outsiders Can Certainly Become Experts
    Leading Cadres of the First Automobile Factory Diligently Study Technology

    Changchun, April 29 (This newspaper dispatch) – More than half of the leading cadres of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant have been persistently engaging in systematic, after-hours cultural and technical studies since 1954, taking a leap forward on the path of being both “red” and “expert.” Currently, 165 responsible cadres at all levels in the factory have completed junior high school courses, and 145 of them are studying courses at secondary technical schools. More than ten factory-level leading cadres, including Deputy Director Ma Chengzhai, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee Fang Jie, and Deputy Secretary of the Supervisory Committee Shang Jiong, after graduating from after-hours secondary technical schools, are now studying advanced mathematics and mechanics at the university level, or further delving into specialized knowledge of metallurgy, electrical engineering, and mechanical processing in conjunction with their work.

    These leading cadres, who have undergone long-term training in the revolutionary storm, generally have a relatively weak cultural foundation because they did not have the opportunity to study culture and technology during the war years. However, in recent years, amidst their busy work, they have persistently adhered to studying in the early morning, in the evening, and on trains during business trips, undeterred by wind or snow, with extraordinary perseverance. Finally, they have transformed from outsiders in leading the factory into enterprise leading cadres with considerable technical and management knowledge.

    Deputy Director Ma Chengzhai is in charge of material supply. When he first arrived at the automobile factory, he could not even distinguish between steel and iron. Because he did not understand the business, he could not detect when the material supply department ordered the wrong goods. However, after completing all the courses at the secondary technical school last year, he finally understood the performance and use of various materials used in manufacturing automobiles. He can make correct decisions on many major technical issues in material supply. As a result, the chaotic phenomenon of missing or duplicated materials in the factory's material supply no longer occurs. Shen Zenghua, the deputy director of the stamping workshop who is studying advanced mathematics at the Automobile and Tractor Night University, was originally also an enterprise leading cadre who was only "red" and not "expert." Now, he not only understands the principles of automobile manufacturing and the specialized knowledge of mechanical processing, but also has learned mechanical drawing. When equipment breaks down, he can also help workers quickly find the cause and propose solutions, so workers and engineers admire him very much. Most workshops in the automobile factory have workshop directors like this who can both lead various management tasks in the workshop and specifically solve technical problems.

    These leading cadres' persistent hard work has often received encouragement and support from the Party Committee. During the learning process, the Party Committee promptly helped them solve many difficulties and repeatedly encouraged them: Persist, and victory is yours. Recently, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, these leading cadres have become even more enthusiastic about studying science and technology. The entire factory is preparing to further develop after-hours cultural and technical education, requiring more than 400 leading cadres above the section level in the factory who do not have a junior high school education to fully reach the level of secondary technical school graduates within five years.

    外行一定能变成内行
    第一汽车厂领导干部苦学技术
    本报长春29日电　第一汽车制造厂已有半数以上的领导干部，从1954年起就坚持系统的业余文化技术学习，在红透专深的道路上跃进了一步。目前全厂有一百六十五名各级负责干部学完了初中课程，其中有一百四十五人，在学习中等技术学校的课程。副厂长马诚斋、党委副书记方劼、监委副书记尚炯等十多名厂一级的领导干部，从业余中等技术学校毕业以后，又在读大学的高等数学、力学，或结合工作进一步钻研冶金、电工、机械加工等方面的专业知识。
    这些在革命风暴中经过长期锻炼的领导干部，由于在战争时期没有学习文化技术的机会，文化基础一般都比较差。但是在近几年繁忙的工作中，他们以非凡的毅力，顽强地坚持了每天早晨学，晚间学，出差在火车上学，风雪无阻。终于由领导工厂的门外汉，变成了具有相当技术知识和管理知识的企业领导干部。
    副厂长马诚斋分工管材料供应，他初到汽车厂时连钢和铁都分不清。因为不懂业务，材料供应处订错了货，也发现不了。但是当他在去年读完了中等技术学校的全部课程之后，终于懂得了制造汽车所用的各种材料的性能和用途。对材料供应中许多重大的技术性问题，都能作出正确的决定。因此，全厂在材料供应中备料漏项或重复备料的混乱现象，也不再发生了。正在汽车拖拉机夜大学学习高等数学的冲压车间副主任沈曾华，原来也是个只红不专的企业领导干部，现在他不仅懂得汽车制造原理和机械加工的专业知识，并且学会了机械制图。设备出了毛病，他也能帮助工人很快找出原因，提出解决办法，因此工人和工程师都很佩服他。像这样既能领导车间各项管理业务，又能具体解决技术问题的车间主任，汽车厂的大部分车间都有。
    这些领导干部坚持苦学，经常得到党委的鼓励和支持。在学习过程中党委及时帮助他们解决了许多困难，一再鼓励他们：坚持下去，就是胜利。最近，在大跃进的形势下，这些领导干部钻研科学技术的劲头更大了。全厂准备进一步发展业余文化技术教育，五年内要求全厂不到初中文化水平的四百多名科级以上领导骨干，完全达到中等技术学校毕业的水平。　（陈子林）
