    Pay Attention to Quality When Washing and Inspecting Locomotives
    During the Great Leap Forward in production, the Zhuzhou Railway Locomotive Depot developed a tendency to unilaterally pursue shortening the time for washing and inspecting locomotives, while neglecting the quality of washing and inspection. On March 20th, they washed and inspected locomotive No. 3391, and in terms of speed, they reduced the washing and inspection time to 1.58 hours. However, they simplified necessary operational procedures, adopted forced cooling measures, and poured cold water into high-temperature boilers. When scraping the large axle steel tiles and hardware, they did not use air to cool them, but instead soaked the hardware in cold water. This practice seriously damages the lifespan of the boiler and the quality of the hardware. The fault of leaking water pump, which had to be repaired, was also not repaired, and the temperature differed from the Ministry of Railways' regulations by fourteen degrees. Although the quality passed inspection, this kind of quality cannot withstand the test of time, and it is difficult to guarantee that accidents will not occur during operation. I believe that the Leap Forward should achieve simultaneous leaps in quality and quantity. This kind of leap forward at the Zhuzhou Railway Locomotive Depot should not be praised, but should be criticized.

    洗检机车要注意质量
    在生产大跃进中，株洲铁路机务段发生片面追求缩短机车洗检时间而忽视洗检质量的偏向。3月20日，他们洗检三台三九一机车，从速度上说，是把洗检时间缩短到一点五八小时，但是他们简化了必要的作业过程，采取强迫降温措施，用冷水往高温的锅炉里灌。刮大轴钢瓦五金，不用吹风冷却，而是把五金用冷水泡。这种做法严重地损害锅炉的寿命和五金的质量。对必须要修理的水泵漏气的故障，也没有重修，温度与铁道部规定的相差十四度。虽然验收质量合格，但这种质量经不起时间的考验，难保在运行中途不发生事故。我认为，跃进应该做到质和量同时跃进。像株洲铁路机务段这种跃进，就不应当表扬，而且应该批判。
