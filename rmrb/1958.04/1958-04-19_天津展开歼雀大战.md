Tianjin Launches Sparrow Eradication Battle

(Our dispatch) On April 20th, Tianjin will launch a second large-scale sparrow hunting campaign throughout the city.

All commanders and fighters participating in this sparrow hunting campaign must enter their positions before 6:00 AM on the 20th. The entire city will open fire simultaneously at 6:00 AM; a fierce attack will occur from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM; the battlefield will be cleared from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM (searching for sparrows on the scene, blocking all sparrow nests); reconnaissance and search teams will be organized that night to track, capture, kill, dig out, and block.

Based on the experience of the first sparrow hunting campaign and the current "enemy situation," the city has determined that the edge of the city, the suburbs, the areas near the city in the suburbs, and other areas with many sparrows are the key battlefields for this sparrow hunting campaign. In order to kill a large number of sparrows, the city plans to organize encirclements. Within each encirclement, a gap will be left, with a large number of killing forces pre-ambushed, such as firearm teams, silk net teams, and poisoned bait, to focus on capturing and killing sparrows. In order to prevent sparrows from escaping the net, rapid pursuit forces are also arranged outside the encirclement to drive the escaping sparrows back into the encirclement for concentrated annihilation. In addition to fierce bombing, frightening, chasing, and driving, this time a strong force will also be organized to vigorously carry out capture and killing.

In order to reduce and prevent unnecessary fatigue for the commanders and fighters, the city has adopted the method of pre-allocating positions and entering their posts on time.

Each battlefield has a battlefield headquarters. All levels of organs, PLA troops, factories, schools, and other institutions in the city are投入this battle under the unified command of their respective districts and streets.

    天津展开歼雀大战
    本报讯　4月20日天津市将在全市范围内开展第二次大规模的捕雀战役。
    全市所有参加这次捕雀战役的指战员一律在20日拂晓六时以前进入阵地。六时全市同时开火；七时至九时猛攻；九时至十一时打扫战场（搜捕现场的麻雀，堵尽雀窝）；当晚组织侦察搜捕部队跟踪捕、杀、掏、堵。
    该市根据第一次捕雀战役的经验和当前的“敌情”，确定市边缘区、郊区、郊区靠近市区的地带以及其他麻雀多的地区，是这次捕雀战役的重点战场。为了大量杀伤麻雀，该市准备组织包围圈。在每个包围圈内，留下一个空隙地带，预先埋伏下大量的杀伤力量，如火枪队、丝网队和毒饵等，集中捕杀麻雀。为了不使麻雀漏网，在包围圈以外，还安排快速追击部队，以便把突围逃窜的麻雀赶入包围圈内，聚而歼之。这次除了猛轰猛吓猛追猛赶以外，还要组织雄厚的兵力，大力进行捕杀。
    为了减少和防止指战人员不必要的疲劳，该市采取预先分配阵地，按时各自进入岗位的办法。
    各个战场都设有战地指挥部。全市各级机关、解放军部队、各工厂、学校及其他事业单位，都在各该区、街的统一指挥下，投入这一战斗。
