    Big-Character Posters Have Another Advantage

    I think that in addition to the benefits mentioned in Ma Qianzu's "The Benefits of Writing Big-Character Posters," published in the People's Daily on March 24th, big-character posters have another obvious effect: they can promote the development of the literacy campaign.

    Big-character posters are a form of expressing opinions, but it's not just about thinking and talking; it also requires writing. The problem lies in "writing." Some comrades have a lot of ideas in their heads, but they just can't write them down. Seeing others write, they are both anxious and resentful, which stimulates their enthusiasm for "learning." For example, some comrades in our unit are like this. They don't feel anything when they don't write, and they are not very active in mobilizing them to attend literacy classes. However, in this "great blooming and contending" and "double-anti" movement, they deeply feel the pain of not being able to write, so their enthusiasm for learning is high, and they are motivated.

    Leading comrades can also use big-character posters as an example to mobilize literacy efforts.

### 大字报还有一个好处

    大字报还有一个好处
    3月24日人民日报上发表了马前卒的“写大字报的好处”一文，我觉得大字报除那些好处外还有一个明显作用，那就是能促进扫盲运动的开展。
    大字报是发表意见的一种形式，但它不光是想、说就行的，还需要写。问题就在“写”上。有一些同志，肚里有不少货色，就是写不出来，看到别人写真是又急又恨，这就激发他“学习”的热情了。例如我们单位内有些同志就这样，在平常不写字不觉得，动员他上扫盲识字班也不大积极，可是在这次“大鸣大放”，“双反”运动中，深感不能写字之苦，因而学习热情高涨，劲头也来了。
    领导同志也可以用大字报来作为动员扫盲的一个实例。
