The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Nationalities Affairs Commission jointly convened the Second Scientific Discussion Conference on Minority Languages from March 28th to April 16th. I remember that the first conference in December 1955 proposed a leap forward plan for minority language work. Now, this plan has been basically realized. At present, China's socialist construction is in a new upsurge, and the situation of the great leap forward in economic construction in minority areas requires minority language work to catch up with the development of the situation. The task proposed by this conference to "summarize the experience of minority language work in the past two years, implement the five principles for creating and reforming minority languages approved by the State Council, and go all out to achieve a great leap forward in minority language work" is timely.

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, and through the joint efforts of language workers and minority people, minority language work has made great achievements in recent years. This has played a significant role in strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups and promoting the political, economic, and cultural development of minority areas. The Party and the government have devoted great efforts to organizing language surveys. In the past two years, seven minority language survey teams, composed of more than 700 people from more than 20 ethnic groups, have carried out large-scale work in minority areas across the country. Now, the language surveys of 33 ethnic groups have been basically completed. The universal survey of languages provides a scientific basis for solving the problem of minority scripts, and also prepares conditions for scientific research on languages. Only by earnestly doing a good job in the universal survey of languages can we draw correct conclusions in the study of minority languages, and thus correctly implement the Party's ethnic policies and correctly solve the script problems of minority ethnic groups.

After the universal language survey, we have now helped 11 ethnic groups design writing schemes in the Latin alphabet form, and helped the Dai people improve their original writing schemes. Among these new writing schemes, the Zhuang script has been approved by the State Council and is being promoted, and the remaining writing schemes are being experimentally promoted or prepared for experimental promotion. Because of the availability of suitable scripts, various ethnic groups have achieved success in literacy, universal education, and other work, and will play a greater role in further improving the cultural level of the people.

While carrying out the general survey of minority languages and the design of writing schemes, more than 30,000 language work cadres have been trained in recent years, greatly improving the professional level of the original scientific workers, and becoming a huge force for promoting minority language work.

In order to learn from each other, exchange experience, and jointly build a socialist motherland, our various ethnic groups need a phonetic alphabet as a common basis for creating and reforming the scripts of various ethnic groups. The promulgation of the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme has solved this political principle problem. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his report on "The Current Tasks of Language Reform": "In the future, when various ethnic groups create or reform scripts, they should, in principle, be based on the Latin alphabet, and should try to be consistent with the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme in the pronunciation and usage of letters." This is completely correct and must be resolutely implemented. In 1957, the State Council, in its reply to the report of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee on the discussion of the Zhuang script scheme and several principles for designing letters in minority script schemes, approved the five principles for designing letters in minority script schemes, which specifically solved the regulations on the letter forms of minority scripts. These five principles are a summary of the experience of ethnic language work in recent years, and they serve not only as a guideline for designing script letters, but also as a principle for guiding the entire minority language work.

Minority language work is still a young social science in our country. To solve its theoretical and practical problems, we must solve the problems of the class stand, ideological methods, and understanding of the principles of minority language work among scientific workers. The achievements of minority language work in the past few years have been great, and the language workers have been working hard. This should be affirmed, but there are also many shortcomings and errors. This meeting summarized the experience, affirmed the achievements, and at the same time sharply criticized the phenomena of being divorced from politics, divorced from reality, and divorced from the masses in language work, which explains this point.

There are two roads and two kinds of thoughts in minority language work and among language workers. This is the struggle between socialist thought and bourgeois thought, that is, the struggle between proletarian collectivist thought and bourgeois nationalist thought. Some people emphasize the "differences," "divisions," and "purity" in language work, which is a concrete manifestation of bourgeois viewpoints. The so-called "differences" is to exaggerate the differences between languages and obliterate their commonalities, as if the greater the language difference, the better, and the more language types and script types, the better. The so-called "divisions" is to fail to see the unifying role of scripts within an ethnic group and between ethnic groups, and to emphasize the difficulty of using the same script scheme for different dialects within an ethnic group, and to emphasize the difficulty of ethnic groups with basically the same language adopting a "script alliance." The so-called "purity" is to emphasize the "purification" of language, and to fail to see the rapid development of socialist economy and culture and the increasing closeness between the people of all ethnic groups. In fact, the so-called "purity" is to exclude from the language loanwords from Chinese and other ethnic languages that the masses have already used, and to isolate their own ethnic group. In fact, the cultural exchanges between ethnic groups, learning from each other, and the mutual borrowing of ethnic languages, this does not negate the good things of their own ethnic group, but enriches and enriches the ethnic culture. This is not a terrible thing, but a good thing to be welcomed.

Some people, regardless of the urgent needs of minority people for language work, are keen on "one-bookism" and write behind closed doors. In order to achieve their own goals, some people even seal the materials collected by everyone in "small warehouses" and regard them as "scientific secrets." Or monopolize certain research topics as "private plots" and forbid others to ask questions. Some people are unwilling to follow the mass line in their work, unwilling to go deep into the countryside, unwilling to understand the language of the masses, unwilling to carry out work in an organized manner, and only want to be "self-employed households," or "limited companies" run by a few people. This meeting exposed and criticized these mistakes, thus making the meeting lively, vivid, and colorful, solving ideological problems and solving work problems.

Because everyone's ideological awareness has been greatly improved and their enthusiasm for work has greatly increased, this meeting was able to propose a great leap forward plan for minority language work in the future based on the construction line of "more, faster, better, more economical, going all out, and striving for the upstream." The plan requires three years of hard work to strive to complete the formulation of writing schemes for ethnic groups that need to create scripts in 1958; to help ethnic groups that do not need to create scripts independently to complete the work of determining and selecting a suitable script in 1959; and to help ethnic groups that need to reform scripts to initially propose script reform schemes before 1960.

This plan reflects the wishes and interests of the minority people, who will do everything possible to support the complete realization of this plan. In recent years, minority work has laid a preliminary foundation, accumulated a lot of experience in the work, and has a group of language workers and experts, especially the five principles for designing writing schemes, which are all favorable conditions for realizing the plan.

To realize this plan, the most important thing is to give play to the role of people. If language workers are to catch up with the situation and play the greatest role in realizing this plan, they must burn bourgeois individualism in the rectification movement, go all out, forge ahead bravely, and strive to train themselves into scientific workers who are both red and expert, and thoroughly red and deeply expert. Language workers and scientists must go to the fiery practical life and rely on the strength and wisdom of the minority masses to do a good job in language work.

The progress of minority language work requires the concern and active assistance of all parties. This work needs everyone to promote it. The local Party and government leading organs should strengthen the leadership of minority language work, the local ethnic language work institutions and ethnic affairs institutions should strengthen the specific guidance and assistance to this work, and take measures to ensure the realization of the minority language work plan.

### 少数民族语文工作需要促进

    少数民族语文工作需要促进
    中国科学院和民族事务委员会在3月28日到4月16日联合召开了第二次少数民族语文科学讨论会。记得1955年12月间的第一次会上提出过一个少数民族语文工作的跃进规划，现在，这个规划已经基本上实现了。目前我国社会主义建设处于新的高潮中，少数民族地区经济建设大跃进的形势要求少数民族语文工作也要赶上形势的发展。这次会议提出了“总结两年来少数民族语文工作经验，贯彻执行国务院批准的少数民族创制和改革文字的五项原则，鼓足革命干劲，实现少数民族语文工作的大跃进”的任务是适时的。
    少数民族语文工作在党和政府的领导下，通过语文工作者和少数民族人民的共同努力，几年来已经取得了很大的成绩。这对于加强各民族的团结，促进少数民族地区政治、经济、文化的发展起了很大的作用。党和政府曾经用很大的力量来组织语言的普查工作。近两年，由二十多个民族七百多人组成的七个少数民族语言调查队，在全国少数民族地区开展了规模巨大的工作，现在已经有三十三个民族的语言普查工作基本上完成。语言的普遍调查为解决少数民族文字问题提供了科学依据，同时也为语言的科学研究准备了条件。只有认真地作好语言的普遍调查工作，才可能在少数民族语言的研究中得出正确的结论，因而才能够正确地贯彻党的民族政策，正确地解决少数民族的文字问题。
    经过语言的普遍调查以后，现在我们已经帮助十一个民族设计了拉丁字母形式的文字方案，帮助傣族改进了原有的文字方案。在这些新文字方案中，僮文已经国务院批准正在推行，其余文字方案也正在实验推行或准备实验推行。因为有了适用的文字，各民族已经在扫盲、普及教育等工作上获得了成效，对于进一步提高人民的文化水平还将发挥更大的作用。
    在进行少数民族语言普查和文字方案设计的同时，几年来已经培养了三万多语文工作干部，大大提高了原有的科学工作者的业务水平，成为一支推进少数民族语文工作的巨大力量。
    为了互相学习，交流经验，共同建设社会主义的祖国，我们各民族需要一种拼音字母作为各民族创制和改革文字的共同基础。汉语拼音方案的公布解决了这个政治原则问题。周恩来总理在“当前文字改革的任务”的报告中指出：“今后各民族创造或者改革文字的时候，原则上应该以拉丁字母为基础，并且应该在字母的读音和用法上尽量跟汉语拼音方案取得一致。”这是完全正确和必须坚决贯彻执行的。1957年国务院在中国文字改革委员会关于讨论僮文方案和少数民族文字方案中设计字母的几项原则的报告的批复中，批准少数民族文字方案中设计字母的五项原则，就是具体地解决少数民族文字字母形式的规定。这五项原则是几年来民族语文工作的经验总结，它不仅作为设计文字字母的准绳，而且也是指导整个少数民族语文工作的原则。
    少数民族语文工作在我国还是一门年青的社会科学，要解决它的理论和实际问题，必须解决科学工作者的阶级立场、思想方法和对少数民族语文工作原则的认识问题。过去几年少数民族语文工作的成就是很大的，语文工作者是努力的，这点应该肯定，但是缺点和错误也不少。这次会议在总结经验，肯定成绩的同时，尖锐地批判了语文工作中存在着的脱离政治、脱离实际和脱离群众的现象，说明了这一点。
    在少数民族语文工作和语文工作者中存在着两条道路和两种思想。这就是社会主义思想和资产阶级思想，也就是无产阶级集体主义思想和资产阶级民族主义思想的斗争。有些人强调语文工作中的“异”“分”“纯”，就是资产阶级观点的具体表现。所谓“异”就是夸大语言间的差异性，抹杀其共同性，好像语言差别越大越好，语言种类、文字种类越多越好。所谓“分”就是看不到文字对于一个民族内部和各民族间所起的团结作用，强调一个民族内部不同方言使用相同的文字方案的困难，强调语言基本相同的民族采取“文字联盟”的困难。所谓“纯”就是强调语言“纯洁化”，看不到随着社会主义经济文化迅速发展和各民族人民相互间日益接近的情况。事实上，所谓“纯”就是要从语言中排斥群众已经使用的汉语和其他民族语言的借词，而把自己的民族孤立起来。实际上，各民族的文化交流，互相学习，民族语言的互相借词，这不是否定了本民族优良的东西，而是更加充实和丰富了民族文化，这是民族语言的发展。这不是可怕的事，而是值得欢迎的好事。
    有些人不顾少数民族人民对语文工作当前的迫切需要，热中于“一本书主义”，关起门来著作。这些人为了达到自己的目的，甚至把大家调查的资料密封在“小仓库”里，视为“科学机密”。或者把某些研究题目垄断起来，作为“自留地”，不许别人问津。有些人在工作中不愿走群众路线，不愿深入农村，不愿了解群众的语言，不愿有组织地进行工作，只愿当“单干户”，或者是由少数人开“股份公司”。这次会议针对着这些错误都进行了揭露和批评，因而使会议开得生动活泼，有声有色，解决了思想问题也解决了工作问题。
    由于大家思想觉悟大大提高了，工作热情也大大高涨了，因此这次会议能够根据“多、快、好、省、鼓足干劲、力争上游”的建设路线，提出了今后少数民族语文工作大跃进的规划。规划要求苦战三年，争取在1958年内帮助需要创造文字的民族完成文字方案的制定工作；在1959年内帮助不需要单独创造文字的民族完成确定和选择一种适用的文字的工作；在1960年前帮助需要改革文字的民族初步提出文字改革方案。
    这个规划反映了少数民族人民的愿望和利益，他们将尽一切努力，支持这个规划的完满实现。几年来少数民族工作已经打下了初步的基础，在工作中积累了不少经验，并且有了一批语文工作者和专家，特别是有了设计文字方案的五项原则，这些都是实现规划的有利条件。
    要实现这个规划，最重要的要发挥人的作用。语文工作者要赶上形势，在实现这个规划中发挥最大的作用，就必须在整风中烧掉资产阶级个人主义，鼓足干劲，奋勇前进，努力把自己锻炼成为又红又专、红透专深的科学工作者。语文工作者和科学家必须到火热的实际生活中去依靠少数民族群众的力量和智慧来作好语文工作。
    少数民族语文工作的进展，需要各方的关心和积极帮助。这个工作需要大家来促进。当地党政领导机关应该加强对于少数民族语文工作的领导，各地民族语文工作机构和民族事务机构应该加强对这一工作的具体指导和帮助，并且采取措施，保证少数民族语文工作规划的实现。
