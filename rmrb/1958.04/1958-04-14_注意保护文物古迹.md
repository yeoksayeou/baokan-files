    Pay Attention to Protecting Cultural Relics and Historic Sites
    Currently, rural areas everywhere are engaged in water conservancy projects such as building reservoirs and digging canals. I suggest that relevant departments pay attention to protecting cultural relics and historic sites.
    Our country has many ancient tombs of high historical value, especially many historic sites, such as temples, pagodas, etc., that are spread all over the country, and most of them are in rural areas. These historic sites are not only of reference value for architecture, but also are our country's valuable heritage.
    I suggest:
    ① Localities should immediately report any discoveries of ancient tombs or cultural relics to the government.
    ② During construction, do not demolish temples or monasteries, especially pagodas. Any use of them must be approved by the government.
    ③ Within the limits of national financial resources, repair historic sites as much as possible to better protect them.

    In the high tide of large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements in vast rural areas, there has been a serious phenomenon of damage to cultural relics. For example, some agricultural production cooperatives and some members in Jiangbei, Nan'an, and Shapingba districts of Chongqing City dismantled many Song Dynasty tombstone slabs to build weirs, dams, pigsties, and manure pools. Among the tombstones that were demolished, many were exquisite and beautiful stone carvings, which are of important reference value for studying the history and culture and art of the motherland. At present, the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee has issued a notice requiring people's committees at all districts and townships to conscientiously protect cultural relics in accordance with the national cultural relics decrees, and to carry out propaganda work. However, similar phenomena of damage to cultural relics may also occur in other regions. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments take effective measures to do a good job in cultural relic protection and publicity to prevent cultural relics from being damaged.

### 注意保护文物古迹

    注意保护文物古迹
    目前，各地农村都在进行建水库、挖水渠等兴修水利工作，我建议有关部门要注意保护文物古迹。
    我国有很多具有很高历史价值的古墓，特别是很多古迹，如寺庙、塔等等，遍布全国，而且大部分都在农村中。这些古迹不仅对建筑学有参考价值，而且是我国的宝贵遗产。
    我建议：
    ①各地发现古墓或文物应立即向政府报告。
    ②建筑中，千万不要拆毁庙宇、寺院，特别是塔，必须经过政府批准才可动用。
    ③在国家经费许可的条件下，尽可能修缮古迹，把古迹保护得更好。

    在广大农村大兴水利和积肥运动的高潮中，出现了破坏文物的严重现象。例如：重庆市江北、南岸和沙坪坝等区的部分农业生产合作社和部分社员就把不少宋墓石板拆去修筑堰塘、堤坝、猪圈和粪池。在被拆除的墓石中，有不少是精致华美的石刻，对研究祖国历史和文化艺术有重要的参考价值。目前，重庆市人民委员会已经发出通知，要求各区、乡人民委员会根据国家公布的文物法令切实保护文物，并开展宣传工作。但是，类似这种破坏文物的现象，其他地区也可能发生。因此，我建议有关部门要采取有效措施，做好文物保护和宣传工作，防止文物遭受损失。
