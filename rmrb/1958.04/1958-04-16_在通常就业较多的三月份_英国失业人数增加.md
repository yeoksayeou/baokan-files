Xinhua News Agency, London, April 15th. Figures released on April 14th by the British Ministry of Labour and National Service show that unemployment in Britain increased by 9,000 in March compared to February, raising the unemployment rate from 1.9% of the total workforce in February to 2% in March.

According to official figures, as of March 17th, the number of unemployed in Britain reached 433,000, the highest record of unemployment in Britain since January 1953. In addition, there were 103,000 partially unemployed people in March, an increase of 21,000 from February.

Unemployment is particularly severe in certain regions of Britain. According to official figures, in Northern Ireland alone, 50,822 people were unemployed in March, accounting for 10.7% of the total local workforce. The unemployment situation is even more serious in Scotland. The Scottish Trades Union Congress issued a statement on April 13th, pointing out that the number of unemployed in Scotland accounts for about 20% of the total number of unemployed in the UK. In some areas of Scotland, the number of unemployed ranges from 13% to 33% of the total workforce.

The British "Financial Times" pointed out in an editorial on April 15th that since July last year, the number of unemployed in Britain has been increasing every month. The continued increase in unemployment in March is "contrary to normal seasonal trends."

The newspaper also pointed out that the situation in some regions with particularly severe unemployment is continuing to deteriorate. There is still "no sign of improvement in the downward trend" of business activity in these regions.
