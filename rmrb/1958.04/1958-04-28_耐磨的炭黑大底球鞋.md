    Wear-Resistant Carbon Black Sole Sneakers
    Recently, some rubber factories have been producing a type of carbon black sole sneaker. Before these sneakers are available on the market, I would like to introduce their characteristics:
    The style of carbon black sole sneakers is the same as ordinary sneakers, except that the sole is black. Because the rubber compound of the sole contains carbon black reinforcing agent used in the manufacture of automobile tires, the sole is very wear-resistant. Trial wear results prove that the service life of carbon black sole sneakers trial-produced by Qingdao State-Owned Ninth Rubber Factory is 47% to 73% higher than that of ordinary sneakers, and those produced by Liaoning Rubber Factory are about 60% higher. This kind of sneaker is essentially different from the black-soled sneakers produced in Tianjin in the past. The black sole of the former is due to the addition of carbon black reinforcing agent, while the latter uses reclaimed rubber and is colored black, so it is not wear-resistant and is easily broken.
    Another feature of carbon black sole sneakers is that they are lightweight and suitable for walking, labor, and sports activities.

### 耐磨的炭黑大底球鞋

    耐磨的炭黑大底球鞋
    最近有些橡胶厂正在生产一种炭黑大底球鞋。在市场还没有供应之前，我先把这种球鞋的特点介绍一下：
    炭黑大底球鞋的样式与一般球鞋相同，只是鞋底是黑色的。这种鞋的鞋底胶料中，因为加入了制造汽车轮胎使用的炭黑补强剂，因而鞋底很耐磨。试穿的结果证明：青岛国营第九橡胶厂试制的炭黑大底球鞋的穿用期限比一般球鞋提高47％到73％，辽宁橡胶厂制的提高60％左右。这种球鞋和过去天津出产的黑大底球鞋有本质上的不同，前者的黑底是因为加用了炭黑补强剂，后者是用再生胶另着黑颜色，故不耐磨，并且容易折断。
    炭黑大底球鞋的另一个特点是轻便，适用于走路、劳动及体育活动。
