Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: Honolulu dispatch: Local Judge John Wiig issued an order on the 24th prohibiting four American peace activists from traveling to Eniwetok Atoll to protest the upcoming US nuclear weapons tests there.

Led by Reverend Bigelow, the four peace activists were traveling from California on the "Golden Rule" ship to Eniwetok to protest the US nuclear weapons tests. After arriving in Honolulu, they were subjected to various obstructions by the local US authorities. After threats and intimidation proved ineffective, the US authorities resorted to violent legal means.

Bigelow issued a statement condemning the US government's violent actions.

The Honolulu District Court is scheduled to hold a hearing on the case on May 1st.

Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: London dispatch: Ignoring opposition from world and British domestic public opinion, the British government has officially announced that it will conduct another new hydrogen bomb test soon.

The British Admiralty and the Foreign Office announced on the 25th that a new hydrogen bomb test will be held in the Christmas Island area of the South Pacific. They also announced that the sea area of 38,000 square miles near Christmas Island has been designated as a "danger area", warning ships of all countries not to enter this area from the 26th. The specific date of the test was not disclosed.
