    (Our Dispatch) A striking scene can be observed at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences: Agricultural science workers, in the midst of the "Double-Anti" Movement, have concentrated their efforts on burying various forms of bourgeois ideology, recognizing that these ideologies severely hinder the great leap forward in agricultural science. Through numerous dazibao (big-character posters), public readings of dazibao that deeply criticize bourgeois ideology at both the academy and institute levels, and the holding of "heart-to-heart" meetings, they have launched a competition to compare political awareness, ideology, drive, and both "redness" (political consciousness) and expertise.

    Senior, mid-level, and young agricultural scientists alike agree that the most prominent obstacle to the great leap forward in agricultural science is the pursuit of fame and personal gain. One scientist wrote in a dazibao: "My most prominent fault is the pursuit of fame and personal gain; I want to be an expert, I want to be an authority. Because I focus solely on personal fame and gain, emphasizing personal interests, I naturally, consciously or unconsciously, relax on the work that is urgently needed for current production, which means disregarding the state's tasks." After criticizing his infatuation with breeding new varieties to achieve instant fame and blindly pursuing theoretical research, aiming too high, and deviating from practical work, he deeply recognized the harm of individualism. He wrote in the conclusion of his dazibao: "I sincerely thank the Party for sounding the alarm for me, waking me from my dream." Another scientist, in a dazibao titled "Examining My Bourgeois Individualism from the Painful Lesson of Splitting Off and Working Alone in the Cultivation of New Winter Wheat Varieties in Shijiazhuang," systematically and deeply examined the losses to the people's cause caused by the pursuit of fame and personal gain, refusing to cooperate with others, and single-mindedly seeking to split off and work alone. He sincerely expressed his determination to burn away this unhealthy trend in himself during this movement.

    The specific manifestation of the pursuit of fame and personal gain is conducting research for the sake of publishing papers. Many agricultural scientists bravely exposed themselves in this regard. One assistant researcher said: "I am unwilling to conduct surveys and studies on the productive forces of arable land needed for current production; instead, I am willing to engage in research on improving my method of salt base exchange analysis in order to publish papers and achieve personal fame as soon as possible." Another assistant researcher revealed that the reason he was unwilling to accept the leadership of older scientists was: "I am afraid that when the research is successful in the future, when publishing the paper, I will be ranked last and become an insignificant role." Under the domination of this kind of thinking, they even set up their own shop and engaged in "black projects." According to disclosures and statistics, the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute alone had sixty-two "black projects," accounting for 32% of the institute's total research topics. Other units, such as the Horticulture Department, the Central Veterinary Biological Products Inspection Institute, the Plant Protection Research Institute, the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Research Institute, and the Agricultural Economics Research Group, also had varying numbers of "black projects."

    "Science for the sake of science" was once considered by many to be synonymous with aloofness. Under the influence of this slogan, many people went astray. An older scientist exposed that in the past, he "believed that promoting [research results] was not the business of scientists" and "could not bear to hear about solving practical problems" because that "cannot promote the development of science." Now he feels very painful because, for several years, his results of science for science was wasted national resources and wasted his own energy, but ended up achieving nothing. Under the influence of this older scientist, a young research intern also confided in the Party, saying that she yearned for the title of "scientist," believing that research in laboratories and experimental fields was "real science" and "the highest level of science," and was unwilling to go to the countryside to engage in grassroots work. He criticized this erroneous thinking, saying that behind "science for the sake of science" is the hidden desire to "become famous overnight," and "aloofness" is the result of not being concerned with politics, and that ultimately, it is a failure to truly understand who should be served.

    Many agricultural scientists also criticized the tendency to emphasize personal interests and disregard production, as well as its harmful consequences. A senior researcher revealed that in order to satisfy his personal research interests, he developed ideas and behaviors of outwardly complying but inwardly opposing. He said that in the past, he was: "You [the Party] tell me to do whatever, and the name and method cannot restrain what I want to do. I can change seventeen topics to one name, but the content will not change." His self-criticism shows that this senior researcher has begun to resolve to replace his past false heart towards the Party with a sincere heart.

    While confessing to the Party, agricultural scientists also confided in each other. "Professionals are enemies," mutual disrespect, lack of contact, and even mutual exclusion – these phenomena were quite common in the past. They realized that this disunity was one of the main factors hindering the great leap forward in agricultural science, and that everything must proceed from the interests of the 600 million people. As a result, they eliminated prejudices, and many long-unresolved unity issues were resolved. Touching scenes of shaking hands and making peace reappeared. Liu Shouchu and Hu Jisheng, two associate researchers at the Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute, had been in the same office for a long time, but they had been back-to-back, each facing the wall, not talking to each other, and communicating everything through clerks. This time, Liu Shouchu made a deeper self-criticism, and then Hu Jisheng also made a self-criticism. The two finally established a new friendship. The multifaceted disunity within the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Research Institute also saw a new atmosphere of great unity because everyone confided in each other, and their hearts resonated with each other.

    After the agricultural scientists confessed to the Party, a high tide of comparing drive and making a leap forward immediately emerged. They unanimously used practical actions of the great leap forward in agricultural science to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. The Cotton Insect Control Group of the Plant Protection Research Institute, based on the control of 600,000 mu of cotton fields in four provinces of North China in 1957, will control 23 million mu in 1958, and achieve 100% control of cotton fields in North China in 1959, expanding to the whole country, controlling 90 million mu of cotton fields, and fulfilling the tasks stipulated in the Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. The Wheat Crop Division of the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute plans to complete the improvement of winter wheat varieties in four provinces of North China in three years and popularize them nationwide in 1960. In order to combine the experience of large-scale high-yield technical measures summarized in large-scale production, this year they will participate in the summary of high-yield experience of 10,000 mu of wheat yielding 1,000 jin per mu in Gaocheng County. Particularly exciting is that the entire academy has formed six agricultural science work teams, which are going down to the countryside and up to the mountains one after another, so that agricultural science is beginning to take root in the countryside.

    向党交心同资产阶级思想决裂
    农业科学院展开“五比”竞赛
    用农业科学大跃进支援农业生产大跃进
    本报讯　走进中国农业科学院可以鲜明地看到，农业科学工作者们在双反运动中集中力量送葬了各式各样的资产阶级思想，因为这些思想严重地障碍着农业科学的跃进。他们透过一本本的大字报、在全院的和各研究所的会上宣读挖资产阶级思想挖得深的大字报以及开交心会，展开了比政治、比思想、比干劲、比红比专的竞赛。
    高级、中级和年青的农业科学工作者们一致认为，最突出地障碍农业科学跃进的是名利思想。一位科学家在大字报中写道：“我突出的毛病就是名利思想，想当专家，想做权威。由于一心只追求个人名利，强调个人兴趣，自然而然就把当前生产上迫切需要进行的工作有意无意中放松过去，也就是置国家任务于不顾了。”他在批判了他醉心于选育新品种一举成名和盲目追求理论研究、好高鹜远、脱离实际的工作以后，深深地认识到个人主义的危害性，他在大字报的结语中写道：“我衷心感谢党对我敲起了警钟，使我从迷梦中清醒起来。”另一位科学家在以“从石家庄冬小麦新品种培育分家单干的惨痛教训来检查我的资产阶级个人主义思想”为题的大字报中，系统和深入地检查了由于名利思想，拒绝与人合作，一味图谋分家单干，对人民事业所造成的损失。他诚恳地表示，要在这次运动中烧掉自己身上的一股歪风邪气。
    名利思想的具体表现，是为论文而进行研究。许多农业科学工作者在这方面勇敢地作了暴露。一位助理研究员说：“我不愿进行当前生产需要的农耕地生产力的调查研究，而愿搞自己的盐基代换分析方法的改进的研究，以便早日发表论文，个人成名。”另一位助理研究员揭露自己不愿接受老科学家领导的原因是：“怕将来研究成功了，发表论文时，我排在最末一名，成为一个不足轻重的角色。”在这种思想支配下，竟至另立门户，搞起“黑题目”来。据揭露统计，仅作物育种栽培研究所的“黑题目”就有六十二个，占该所研究题目总数32％。其他如园艺系、中央兽医生物药品监察所、植物保护研究所、畜牧兽医研究所、农业经济研究组等单位都有数目不等的“黑题目”。
    “为科学而科学”，曾经被许多人认为是清高的代名词，在这个口号影响下，多少人走了弯路。一位老科学家暴露他过去“曾认为推广（研究成果）不是科学家的事，听不惯解决实际问题的说法”，因为那“不能促进科学的发展”。现在他感到很沉痛，因为几年来他为科学而科学的结果是，浪费了国家资财，浪费了自己的精力，结果却一无所得。在这位老科学家的影响下，一位青年研究实习员也向党交出了自己的心，她说，她非常向往“科学家”的称号，认为试验室和试验地的研究才是“真正的科学”，才是“最高的科学水平”，不愿下乡搞基点工作。他批判这种错误思想说，“为科学而科学”后面隐藏着的是想“一鸣惊人”，“清高”是不问政治的结果，归根到底是没有真正闹清该为谁服务。
    许多农业科学工作者还批判了强调个人兴趣、不问生产的倾向和它的恶果。一位高级研究人员自我揭露说，他为了满足个人研究兴趣，产生了阳奉阴违的思想和行为。他说，过去他是：“你们（党）叫我搞啥我搞啥，名称方法拘束不了我要搞的东西。我可以把十七个课题改为一个名称，但内容不会变。”他的检讨说明，这位高级研究人员已开始决心用真诚的心来代替过去那颗对党虚假的心。
    向党交心的同时，农业科学工作者们彼此也交了心。同行是冤家，互不尊重，互不联系，甚至互相排挤，这些现象过去是相当普遍的。他们认识到这种不团结就是障碍农业科学工作跃进的主要因素之一，必须一切从六亿人民的利益出发，因而消除了成见，许多长期解决不了的团结问题解决了，令人感动的握手言欢的场面一再出现。土壤肥料研究所的两位副研究员刘守初和胡济生长期同处一室，却背靠背，各自面壁，互不交谈，事无巨细都通过事务员打交道。这次，刘守初作了较深刻的检查，继而胡济生也作了检查，两人终于建立了新的友谊。畜牧兽医研究所的多角不团结现象，也由于大家都交出了心，心心相印，出现了大团结的新气象。
    农业科学工作者们向党交心以后，立即涌现出比干劲、比跃进的高潮。他们一致用农业科学大跃进的实际行动支援农业生产大跃进。植物保护研究所棉虫防治组在1957年防治华北四省棉田六十万亩的基础上，1958年将防治二千三百万亩，1959年百分之百防治华北棉田，并扩展到全国，防治九千万亩棉田，提前实现农业发展纲要规定的任务。作物育种栽培研究所麦作室计划三年完成华北四省冬小麦优种化，1960年普及全国；为了结合大生产中总结大面积丰产技术措施，今年他们将参加藁城县万亩千斤小麦的丰产经验总结。特别激动人心的是，全院已经组成六个农业科学工作队，正先后下乡上山，使农业科学普遍开始在农村里生根。
