By our Yangliuqing correspondent: In the process of utilizing nature, transforming nature, and thoroughly completing the transformation of low-lying areas, the vast number of cadres in Tianjin Special District have gone deep among the masses and into production, diligently studied, and transformed themselves from laymen into experts, excellently mastering the complete set of technology for transforming low-lying areas. Party secretaries of the prefecture and county committees, as well as commissioners and county heads, all know how to transplant seedlings, plant rice, repair canals, and build sluice gates. Many cadres carry four treasures with them: an iron hoe (for digging ditches), a tape measure (for measuring), a magnifying glass (for preventing and controlling pests and diseases), and a water thermometer (for testing soil temperature). The Tianjin Regional Party Organization of the Communist Party of China has some preliminary experience in training cadres to achieve the unity of politics and technology and to realize the task of being both Red and expert.

The area of low-lying land in Tianjin Special District accounts for about 70% of the total cultivated area of the district. The entire district has suffered from disasters for years, with an annual shortage of 500 to 600 million catties of grain. In order to completely reverse this situation, the Tianjin Prefectural Party Committee organized more than 1,900 cadres (more than one-third of the total number of cadres in the district) to extensively go deep among the masses, investigate and research, and summarize the typical experience of the masses in their struggle against nature, and formulated a revolutionary policy of "utilizing nature, transforming nature, and turning water disasters into water conservancy" to thoroughly transform low-lying areas.

To implement this policy, all cadres in the district must have a revolution in their ideological style. To this end, the Tianjin Prefectural Party Committee first proposed that from the prefectural committee to the grassroots cadres, all should leave their offices, live with the peasants, and fight against floods and waterlogging together to completely solve the problem of transforming low-lying areas. At that time, some cadres had unconsciously developed an office-oriented work style, believing that only going to work and getting off work on time was a standardized working method, and considered the proposal of the prefectural committee to go deep into the countryside and into production as a "rural style" and "guerrilla habits." After ideological criticism and political education, more than two-thirds of the cadres in the district, including leading Party and government cadres, packed their bedding and went deep into the countryside to transform low-lying areas. In accordance with the principle of "transforming low-lying areas wherever they are, and cadres living there," the cadres sent down were all placed at the grassroots level until the low-lying areas were transformed and the rice was harvested.

While transforming the ideological style of the cadres, the Tianjin Prefectural Party Committee raised the issue of cadres mastering technology. Because the transformation of low-lying areas is a production revolution, a groundbreaking initiative for communists to rely on the masses, adapt to local conditions, and thoroughly change production practices, it requires cadres and the broad masses to learn and work together.

In the process of learning technology, the first thing to solve is the question of who the technology belongs to. At that time, many cadres believed that water management was the business of engineers and technicians. They said, "I am not this kind of bug, I cannot drill this wood." The Prefectural Party Committee pointed out that the transformation of low-lying areas is not simply a matter of water management. It is the most fundamental interest of millions of people and the central task of the Tianjin Regional Party Organization's struggle, and the entire Party must take action to direct the masses in this struggle against nature. This is mass technology, and it must be obtained from the practice of mass production struggle.

There are several ways to learn technology. One is to start by summarizing the local masses' experience in their struggle against nature and learn directly in production practice. The second is to invite people to tutor or visit other places. The third is for leading cadres to delve into research and solve the difficulties in their own areas.

After three years of hard study, more than two-thirds of the 4,800 cadres in Tianjin Special District have generally mastered the entire set of techniques for transforming low-lying areas, from the planning and design of water conservancy projects, the improvement of soil, the planting of paddy fields to the management of irrigation. More than 20,000 sluice gates and culverts were built in Tianjin Special District, most of which were designed by cadres and local technicians. For example, a large river dam with a flow rate of 400 on the Jiyun River in Ninghe County was originally designed by an engineer from the Commissioner's Office, which was to be completed in two years and required a national investment of 18 million yuan. As a result, last winter, Li Bofang, secretary of the Ninghe County Party Committee, and Zhao Yicheng, deputy county head of Jinghai County, jointly designed a soft dam made of reeds and hemp, which cost only more than 400,000 yuan and irrigated 500,000 mu of paddy fields.

At present, Tianjin Special District, which has 42 rivers and 92 low-lying areas, has formed a complete irrigation network in which rivers are connected to each other, canals are connected to each other, and low-lying areas are connected to each other, basically realizing water conservancy. In three years, a total of 9.5 million mu of low-lying land has been transformed, increasing grain production by 2 billion catties, turning the entire district from a grain-deficient area in history to a surplus grain area. Now the whole district is developing in the direction of mechanization and electrification, and many cadres, especially leading cadres at the prefectural and county levels, have begun to study mechanics and electricity.

### 边干边学掌握了技术  天津专区干部在改造洼地中向技术进军

    边干边学掌握了技术
    天津专区干部在改造洼地中向技术进军
    本报杨柳青专电　在利用自然、改造自然、彻底完成洼地改造的过程中，天津专区广大干部深入群众、深入生产，刻苦钻研，由外行变成内行，出色地掌握了全套的洼改技术。地、县委书记和专员、县长都会栽秧、种稻、修渠、建闸。许多干部随身带着四件宝：铁铣（挖渠用）、皮尺（测量用）、扩大镜（防治病虫害用）和水温计（试验土地温度）。在培养干部实现政治和技术的统一，实现又红又专的任务方面，中共天津地区党组织已有初步体会。
    天津专区洼地面积约占全区耕地面积的70％左右。全区连年遭灾，每年缺粮五、六亿斤。为了彻底扭转这一局面，天津地委组织了一千九百多名干部（占全区干部三分之一以上）广泛深入群众，调查研究，总结了群众向自然斗争的典型经验，制定出彻底改造洼地的“利用自然、改造自然、变水患为水利”的革命性的方针。
    要贯彻这一方针，全区干部必须具有思想作风上的革命。为此，天津地委首先提出从地委到基层干部，都要走出办公室，和农民一起生活、一道去和洪水沥水作斗争，彻底解决洼地改造问题。当时，有些干部已经无形中滋长了机关化的工作作风，认为只有到时上下班才是正规化的工作方法，对地委提出的深入农村、深入生产反到认为是“农村作风”及“游击习气”。经过思想批判和政治教育，全区有三分之二以上干部，包括党政负责干部都背起铺盖，深入到农村去改造洼地。按照“改造哪里的洼地，干部就住到哪里”的原则，下去的干部都一直放到基层，直到洼地改好，稻子收了以后。
    在转变干部思想作风的同时，天津地委提出干部掌握技术的问题。由于洼地改造是个生产革命，是共产党人依靠群众、因地制宜、彻底变革生产实践的破天荒的创举，要求干部和广大群众在一起边学边干。
    在学习技术过程中首先要解决技术属于谁的问题。当时许多干部认为：治水是工程师、技术员的事情，他们说：“我不是这号虫，不能钻这个木头”。地委指出洼地改造不单纯是治水问题，这是几百万人的最根本的利益，是天津地区党组织的战斗中心任务，全党都要动手指挥群众进行这一向自然界的斗争。这是群众性的技术，要从群众性的生产斗争实践中去取得。
    学习技术的方法有以下几种。一是从总结当地群众向自然斗争的经验入手，在生产实践中直接学习。二是请人来辅导或去外地参观。三是领导干部深入钻研，动手解决所在地的困难。
    经过三年的刻苦钻研，天津专区四千八百多名干部中，有三分之二以上已普遍掌握了从水利工程的规划设计、土壤的改良、稻田的种植到灌溉的管理这一整套的洼改技术。天津专区修了二万多座闸涵，绝大部分由干部和当地土技术员设计的。如宁河县蓟运河上一个四百个流量的大拦河坝，原来由专署工程师设计了一半，要二年修成，国家要投资一千八百万元。结果，去年冬天宁河县委书记李伯芳和静海县副县长赵义成一起设计了个苇子搀麻的软坝，只花了四十多万元，灌溉了五十万亩稻田。
    目前，拥有四十二条河流、九十二个洼地的天津专区已形成河河相通、渠渠相接、洼洼相连的完整的灌溉网，基本上实现水利化。三年内共改造洼地九百五十万亩，增产粮食二十亿斤，使全区由历史上的缺粮区变为余粮区。现在全区正向机械化及电气化的方向发展，许多干部特别是地、县级的领导干部都开始钻研机械学和电学。
