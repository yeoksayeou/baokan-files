Three Hearts United as One
——A Glimpse into the Heart-to-Heart Movement of Young Scientific Workers in Beijing
By our reporter Lü Xinchu

These three young people work together and seem to be very united. They never quarrel and are always polite. Even when they leave the office after work, they "defer" to each other, letting "Group Leader Li" walk in front. "Group Leader Li" is how Zhang Yilin and Xu Shaoxie respectfully address Li Fengjie, the head of the seismic instrument group. Because they know Li Fengjie likes flattery. In addition to this respectful title, they often use words like "request instructions" when speaking to Li Fengjie.

After the vigorous launch of the ideological exchange and heart-to-heart movement among veteran scientists, young scientific workers in Beijing research institutions were unwilling to lag behind and immediately caught up. The three young technicians in the seismic instrument group of the Institute of Geophysics consciously shared their innermost thoughts with each other. Only then did people realize that behind their "harmony" and "mutual respect" lurked many dirty thoughts.

Last year, young technician Xu Shaoxie successfully modified the "May 1st" seismograph. The other two were unwilling to even take a look at Xu Shaoxie's work, believing that seeing Xu Shaoxie's achievements would elevate Xu Shaoxie's status. In Xu Shaoxie's work on developing an electronic seismograph using cigarette paper instead of photographic paper, Zhang Yilin clearly knew that this was an important and promising experiment, but he thought that if Xu Shaoxie succeeded, wouldn't he surpass himself even more? Therefore, he consistently expressed his disapproval of this work, deliberately saying, "Foreign countries have been working on it for a long time, but we haven't heard of using cigarette paper instead of photographic paper." When Xu Shaoxie's work was going smoothly, the other two couldn't feel happy; when Xu Shaoxie encountered problems in his work and was anxious, the other two felt "relieved." With the help of scientists, Xu Shaoxie successfully developed the electronic seismograph. Li Fengjie and Zhang Yilin felt indescribable inside, especially after hearing President Guo Moruo praise Xu Shaoxie's work at a meeting, Zhang Yilin felt extremely uncomfortable. Not long ago, a photo including Xu Shaoxie appeared on the seventh page of the People's Daily, and Zhang Yilin couldn't even bear to look at that page of the People's Daily. He decided to "leave," to leave this research institute. He tried his best to downplay his working ability, saying that he couldn't do things he could do, so that the leadership wouldn't want him and would transfer him away. Now, let's talk about Li Fengjie. He was analyzing why Xu Shaoxie's creation was successful. His answer was, "Probably because Xu Shaoxie's assistant is capable." Therefore, he planned to find an opportunity to transfer Xu's assistant.

Xu Shaoxie also had bourgeois individualism. Seeing that he had "strong strength" and "capital," and estimating that the masses would support him, he once attempted to win over Zhang Yilin to isolate Li Fengjie. Li Fengjie was working on reducing the light spot in the seismic instrument. Xu Shaoxie had done this work before and had some experience, but he was unwilling to actively help Li Fengjie. Li Fengjie was unwilling to ask Xu Shaoxie for advice, so he had to explore on his own, starting from scratch, wasting a lot of time.

After ideological exchange and sharing their innermost thoughts, these three people realized the ugliness and danger of these bourgeois individualist ideas. They also began to actively change their past mistakes, and the situation completely changed. Li Fengjie's work on reducing the light spot was originally planned to be completed by the end of the year with great difficulty, but now with Xu Shaoxie's careful assistance, he is fully confident that he can complete this work ahead of schedule in the third quarter of this year. The three of them each had designated assistants, and in the past, they worked on their own without supporting each other. Now, that has completely changed. When Li Fengjie is busy with work, Xu Shaoxie's assistant takes the initiative to help him. Recently, the group is rushing to make a batch of instruments for the establishment of a seismic station in Lanzhou, and all members of the group are working together. After the ideological exchange, when Zhang Yilin went on a business trip, Xu and Li proactively arranged the tasks he left behind. In the middle of work, everyone discusses and consults with each other; everyone can be open and honest. All of this had never happened among the three of them before. People in the institute said that they used to have three hearts, but now they have become one.

Like these three young technicians, young scientific workers in various research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing have also devoted themselves to the vigorous self-transformation movement. The method of the movement is: everyone shares their innermost thoughts, exposes them universally, and at the same time, selects typical figures for key assistance and discussion based on the principle of voluntariness, to educate the masses with typical examples. There are two types of typical figures: one is people who seem to be "both red and expert" on the surface, but in reality, have a lot of individualistic thoughts; the other is people who are only expert but not red. Young scientific workers who are used as key figures in various research institutions are first nominated by themselves and then determined by the leadership. Many people realize that being discussed as a key figure is to help everyone transform and to improve themselves, so they all strive to be key figures. Most of the young scientific workers have shown their determination to transform themselves in this movement. Now, some research institutes are summarizing the problems exposed by young people, putting forward several general ideological issues for debate, and conducting positive education for the masses.

    三条心合成一条心
    ——北京青年科学工作者交心运动一瞥
    本报记者　吕新初
    这三个年轻人在一起工作，看来真是团结得好，他们从来没有争吵，总是客客气气，甚至在下班走出办公室的时候，也要“礼让”，要让“李组长”走在最前头。“李组长”，是张奕麟、许绍燮两人对这地震仪器组负责人李凤杰的尊称。因为他们知道李凤杰喜欢奉承。除了尊称以外，他们向李凤杰说话时还常常用“请示”这样的字眼。
    在老科学家思想见面和交心运动蓬勃开展以后，北京研究机关中的青年科学工作者也决不愿后人，立即奋起直追。地球物理研究所地震仪器组的这三个青年技佐自觉地互相交出了心底的话，人们才知道在他们的“一团和气”“相敬如宾”的背后，隐藏着许多肮脏的思想。
    去年，青年技佐许绍燮改装“五一”地震仪成功，其他两人连看也不愿看一看许绍燮的工作，他们认为看了许绍燮的工作成就，便会抬高了许绍燮的身价。许绍燮试制电子地震仪的工作中用烟纸代替照相纸，张奕麟明明知道这是一个重要的、很有希望的试验，但是他心想如果许绍燮做成功了，岂不是更加要超过自己了，因此他一直对这项工作表示不支持，故意说：“国外搞的时间可不短，但是没有听到能用烟纸代替照相纸的”。当许绍燮的工作顺利的时候，其他两人怎么也痛快不起来；当许绍燮在工作中发生了问题而焦急的时候，其他两人的心情反而“舒畅起来”。许绍燮在科学家的帮助下，试制电子地震仪的工作成功了，李凤杰和张奕麟内心真有说不出的滋味，特别是听到郭沫若院长在一次会上表扬了许绍燮的工作以后，张奕麟难受极了。不久以前，人民日报第七版上出现了有许绍燮在内的照片，张奕麟连这一版人民日报都看不下去了。他决定要“走”，离开这个研究所。他尽量把自己的工作能力说得低些，会做的工作也说不会做，这样好让领导上不要他，调走他。再说李凤杰。他在分析许绍燮的创造为什么能成功。他的答案是：“大约是许绍燮的助手得力”。因此，他准备有机会把许的助手调动调动。
    许绍燮也同样有着资产阶级个人主义思想。他看到自己“实力雄厚”，“有本钱”，估计到群众又会支持他，所以曾经企图把张奕麟争取过来，孤立李凤杰。李凤杰在做地震仪器中的一项缩小光点的工作，许绍燮过去曾经作过这个工作，有一些体会，但是不肯主动去帮助李凤杰。李凤杰也不肯向许绍燮请教，只好自己摸索，从头做起，白白浪费了很多时间。
    这三个人之间的关系经过思想见面、互相交心，把这些话谈出来以后，才认识到这些资产阶级个人主义思想的丑恶和危险，他们也开始主动地改变过去那些错误的做法，因而情况就完全不同了，李凤杰做的缩小光点的工作原来计划到年底完成还很吃力，现在得到许绍燮的悉心协助，完全有把握提前到今年第三季度完成这项工作。他们三人各有指定的助手，过去各搞各的，互不支援。现在完全改变了。李凤杰工作忙的时候，许绍燮的助手就主动去帮助他。最近这个组为兰州建立地震台赶制一批仪器，全组人员通力合作。在思想见面以后，张奕麟因公出差，许、李两人主动地安排他留下来的任务。在工作中间，大家都有商有量的；什么话，都能当面开诚布公了。这一切，过去在他们三人中间是没有发生过的。所里的人们说他们过去是三条心，现在合成一条心了。
    中国科学院北京各研究机构中的青年科学工作者像这三个年轻技佐一样，都投入了轰轰烈烈的自我改造运动。运动进行的方式是：人人交心、普遍暴露，同时根据自愿的原则选择典型人物重点帮助和讨论，以典型实例向群众进行教育。典型人物有两种：一种是表面上看来似乎是“又红又专”，实质上却存在着不少个人主义思想的人；另一种是只专不红的人。各研究机构中被作为重点的青年科学工作者，都是自己首先报名然后由领导上确定的。许多人认识到自己被作为重点来讨论是为了帮助大家改造同时又为了提高自己，因此都要争取作为重点。大部分青年科学工作者在这次运动中表现了自我改造的决心。现在有些研究所正在把青年人中暴露出来的问题加以归纳，提出几个普遍性的思想问题展开辩论，向群众进行正面教育。
