Xinhua News Agency, April 11th, New York Dispatch: The American bourgeois publication "U.S. News & World Report" estimates in its latest issue published today that there is no hope for the American economic crisis to improve before the end of this year.

"U.S. News & World Report" wrote: "June (this year) is likely to be the month with the highest unemployment. July may encounter the low point of industrial activity. August and September will probably move forward with difficulty." The magazine wrote with a lack of confidence: "It will not be until the end of 1958 that the situation will improve greatly – if there is any improvement at all." The magazine also believes that the U.S. economy will not recover from the economic crisis until 1960.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th, New York Dispatch: Although the "anti-recession measures" taken by the U.S. government have not been effective in stopping the economic recession, the resulting surge in government fiscal deficit is becoming a reality.

Maurice Stans, Director of the U.S. Bureau of the Budget, said on the 9th that the government's fiscal deficit for the 1958 fiscal year (ending at the end of February this year) will increase at least two and a half times more than originally expected, from $400 million to $1.4 billion. Stans also said that there will be a "substantial" deficit in the next fiscal year, instead of the surplus that was expected. He pointed out that this does not include the possibility of a decline in government tax revenue due to the economic recession.

According to a report by United Press today, American economists who study economic trends are worried about the possibility of inflation, and they warn that the "anti-recession" actions taken by the government have "laid the foundation for future inflation." According to their estimates, the budget deficit resulting from the U.S. government's "anti-recession measures" may reach $2 billion to $15 billion.

### “美国新闻与世界报道”估计  美经济危机要拖到后年  “反衰退措施”引起财政赤字激增

    “美国新闻与世界报道”估计
    美经济危机要拖到后年
    “反衰退措施”引起财政赤字激增
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级刊物“美国新闻与世界报道”在今天出版的最新一期中估计，美国经济危机在今年年底之前没有好转的希望。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”写道：“（今年）6月份很可能将是失业人数最多的月份。7月份可能遇到工业活动的低点。8月份和9月份大概将艰难地前进”。这家杂志用没有信心的口吻写道：“要到1958年年底情况才会有很大的好转——如果有任何好转的话”。杂志还认为，到1960年美国经济才能从经济危机中恢复过来。
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：虽然美国政府所采取的“反衰退措施”对于阻止经济衰退并没有发生作用，由此而产生的政府财政赤字激增却眼看着将成为现实。
    美国政府预算局局长莫里斯·斯坦斯9日说，1958财政年度（到今年2月底为止）政府财政赤字数字至少要比原先预计的增加两倍半，即从四亿美元增加到十四亿美元。斯坦斯还说，下一财政年度还会出现“相当大”的赤字，而不会像预期的那样有什么结余。他指出，这还没有把由于经济衰退而使政府税收下降的可能性估计在内。
    据合众社今天报道，研究经济趋势的美国经济学家们都在为可能发生通货膨胀而担忧，他们警告说，政府采取的“反衰退”行动“为将来发生通货膨胀打下了基础”。据他们估计，由于美国政府的“反衰退措施”而产生的预算赤字可能达到二十亿美元到一百五十亿美元。
