Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch: A TASS construction issues commentator said on the 10th that no country in the world has a construction scale as large as the Soviet Union. In the past year alone, approximately eight hundred new large-scale industrial enterprises were put into production in the Soviet Union. The world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station was also fully completed last year.

The commentator stated that the scale of housing construction in the Soviet Union is very large. From 1946 to 1950, it built a total of 72.5 million square meters of housing. From 1951 to 1955, the Soviet Union built another 105 million square meters of housing. During the period from 1956 to 1960, the total area of housing to be constructed will be equal to one-third of the total housing area in the Soviet Union by 1955.

Simultaneously with the year-by-year expansion of housing construction in the Soviet Union, the scale of housing construction in capitalist countries is shrinking year by year. For example, in 1956, the scale of housing construction in Britain shrank by 15%, and in the United States by 18%.

The level of mechanization in Soviet construction work is very high. Last year, more than 75,000 excavators, bulldozers, and cranes were working on construction sites across the country. Industrialized construction methods have been widely adopted in the Soviet construction industry. When constructing houses, only various components and parts prefabricated in factories need to be assembled.

The Soviet Union's total output of prefabricated reinforced concrete ranks first in the world. Its production of prefabricated reinforced concrete components and structures last year increased almost fivefold compared to 1953.

Before the war, the Soviet Union's cement production was relatively backward, but last year it had surpassed all European countries in this regard.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: According to a TASS report, the Soviet Union has already ranked first in the world in terms of the total output of reinforced concrete components. From 1950 to 1957, the Soviet Union's cement production increased by 13.7 million tons, which is almost one and a half times the cement increase in the United States during the same period. This was stated by Ginzburg, Deputy Chairman of the State Construction Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, on the 10th at the All-Union Construction Conference held in the Kremlin. This conference was convened by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. More than 2,000 people attended the meeting. Aristov, Brezhnev, Bulganin, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Mukhitdinov, Furtseva, and Kosygin participated in today's meeting.

In his report, Ginzburg emphasized that starting from 1953-1954, the building materials industry greatly increased the production of prefabricated components, especially reinforced concrete components, large blocks, and large panel walls, which ensured the transition of the construction industry to industrial methods.

Ginzburg said that due to the reorganization of industrial management according to regional principles, the total output of the building materials industry increased by 23% in just one year, which greatly exceeded the growth rate of previous years.

Kuchelenko, Chairman of the State Construction Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, also gave a report at the meeting. He said that the total area of new housing built in 1957 exceeded 48 million square meters, which is more than the total amount of housing built during the entire Second Five-Year Plan period. By 1960, the amount of housing construction should increase by 80% compared to last year. The area of housing to be built in 1960 will be 15 million square meters more than the area of housing built this year. The reporter pointed out that the use of giant block, especially giant panel wall construction methods, is the main way to further develop housing construction and reduce housing costs. If only bricks are used to build houses, the number of construction workers would have to increase by at least 200,000. However, using the giant panel wall method to build houses, the required labor force can be reduced by at least half.

    新企业不断建成　新住宅年年增多
    苏联建筑规模世界第一
    资本主义国家住宅建筑规模一年比一年缩小
    新华社11日讯　塔斯社建筑问题评论员在10日说：世界上任何一个国家的建筑规模都没有苏联这样大。单是去年一年，苏联就有约八百个新的大型工业企业投入生产。世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站就是在去年全部建成的。
    评论员说，苏联住宅建筑的规模非常大。在1946——1950年，它总共建成了七千二百五十万平方公尺的住宅。1951——1955年，苏联又建成了一亿零五百万平方公尺的住宅。在1956——1960年期间，它所要建筑的住宅总面积将等于到1955年时苏联全部住宅总面积的三分之一。
    和苏联住宅建设规模年年扩大同时，资本主义国家的住宅建设规模却年年缩小。例如，1956年英国住宅建设的规模就缩小了15％，美国缩小了18％。
    苏联建筑工作的机械化程度很高。去年，在全国建设工地上工作的有七万五千多台挖掘机、推土机和起重机。苏联建筑工业中已经广泛采用了工业化的建筑方法。在建筑房屋时，只要把工厂预先制造的各种构件和部件装配起来就可以了。
    苏联装配式钢筋混凝土的生产总量已经居世界第一位。它去年生产的装配式钢筋混凝土部件和构件比1953年差不多增加了五倍。
    战前，苏联水泥产量是相当落后的，而去年它在这方面已经超过所有的欧洲国家。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社报道，苏联在钢筋混凝土构件的生产总量上已经占世界第一位。从1950年到1957年，苏联水泥的生产量增加了一千三百七十万吨，这几乎等于美国在同一时期水泥增长量的一倍半。这是苏联部长会议国家建设委员会副主席金兹布尔克10日在克里姆林宫举行的全苏建筑会议上说的。这次会议是苏共中央和苏联部长会议召开的。出席会议的有两千多人。阿里斯托夫、勃列日?夫、布尔加宁、伊格纳托夫、基里钦科、穆希金诺夫、福尔采娃、柯西金参加了今天的会议。
    金兹布尔克在报告中强调说，建筑材料工业从1953—1954年开始，大大地增加了预制构件的生产，首先是钢筋混凝土构件、大型砌块、大块板壁的生产，这保证了建筑业过渡到工业方法。
    金兹布尔克说，由于工业管理按地区的原则加以改组，仅在一年里面，建筑材料工业总产量就增加了23％，这大大超过了前几年的增长速度。
    苏联部长会议国家建设委员会主席库切连科也在会上作了报告。他说，1957年新建住宅总面积超过四千八百万平方公尺，这比整个第二个五年计划期间的全部住宅建筑量还要多。到1960年为止，住宅建筑量应该比去年增加80％。1960年建设的住宅面积将要比今年建设的住宅面积多一千五百万平方公尺。报告人指出，改用巨型砌块、特别是巨型板壁建筑法，是进一步发展住宅建筑和降低住宅成本的主要道路。假如只用砖来建筑住宅，建筑工人的数目就至少要增加二十万人。而采用巨型板壁法来建筑房子，需要的劳动力就至少可以减少一半。
