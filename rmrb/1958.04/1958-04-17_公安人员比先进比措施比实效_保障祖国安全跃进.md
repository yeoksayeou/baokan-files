Xinhua News Agency, April 16th – Inspired and driven by the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, public security organs in various regions have launched a great leap forward in public security work. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of public security personnel have raised the banner of safeguarding the great leap forward in socialist construction and are striving to create a better social order for the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the great leap forward in culture by exerting great efforts, relying on the masses, strengthening politics, and strengthening professional skills.

The momentum of the leap forward in public security organs in various regions is very strong. They have taken various specific measures from all aspects to promote the great leap forward in public security work. In order to realize the leap forward in public security work, Guizhou Province requires "three speeds," "three goods," and "three guarantees." The "three speeds" are: quick reflection of situations, quick summarization of experiences, and quick resolution of problems. The "three goods" are: good work quality, good contact with the masses, and good cooperation with fraternal departments. The "three guarantees" are: guarantee going deep into the lower levels and facing reality; guarantee being modest and prudent, not arrogant or impetuous; and guarantee being conscientious and not afraid of difficulties. Many public security organs have proposed to "go out of the office and strengthen the front line." Public security organs in Hebei, Hunan, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Henan, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces have organized many work groups, led by leaders such as directors, deputy directors, section chiefs, and bureau chiefs, to go deep into the grassroots level and work together with grassroots cadres to do a good job in social security work and promote the great leap forward in public security work.

At present, public security organs in various regions have grasped the main problems in public security work as the outline of the work leap forward, extensively and deeply implemented the mass line, and strived to seek the most advanced and effective measures for each specific task, thus making new achievements in their work. In some places, some major cases, difficult cases, and long-standing unresolved cases that had not been solved in the past have been quickly resolved in the leap forward. For example, the Public Security Department of Gansu Province, due to the personal involvement of its leaders, cracked a major counter-revolutionary case of sending a large number of reactionary letters and stealing state secrets for several years in ten days. The Beicheng Branch of the Taiyuan City Public Security Bureau in Shanxi, led by the deputy director himself, closely contacted the masses and successively cracked two major theft cases of "ground mice" and "grasshoppers" who had been committing crimes for many years within a few days. Public security organs in many places have adopted the method of publicizing the facts of the case to the masses and mobilizing the masses to assist in solving the case for general theft cases, so that the cases can be solved quickly and accurately.

The effectiveness of the work to crack down on fleeing counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders committing crimes is also very significant. There are still a few such elements in many places. Recently, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shanghai, Sichuan, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and other places have successively launched this struggle. Thanks to the close leadership of the Party Committee, the active support of the broad masses, and the coordinated operations between regions, a group of fleeing counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders with serious crimes were quickly and accurately brought to justice. In many places, because this problem has been resolved well, no sabotage has occurred since the spring. For example, no theft cases have occurred at Zhengzhou Railway Station, Beijing Railway Station, and other places since the Spring Festival, which is highly praised by the masses.

In the work of reforming unlawful landlords, rich peasant elements, and counter-revolutionaries who have been treated leniently, as well as bad elements, many public security organs have adopted the form of running short-term training courses, using spare time every day to conduct policy education and law-abiding education for these people, while urging them to work hard. Through these educations, it has played a very good role in reforming the reactionary thinking of these elements, making them realize the harm they have done to society and the people in the past, and choosing the bright future they should take.

Public security organs in various places have proposed in the great leap forward: all public security cadres and people's police must strive to improve their communist ideological awareness, study their professional skills, and be good guards and service personnel for the people. Recently, many model deeds have also emerged in this regard. Public security police stations and household registration police in Shanghai, Beijing, and other cities have adopted the method of rotating office 24 hours a day for the convenience of the masses, which is very popular among the masses. The Wuhan Public Security Bureau mobilized the people's police to help the masses repair chimneys and transform stoves to prevent fires. In order to do a good job in forest fire prevention in southeastern Guizhou, the public security organs of Guizhou Province mobilized the masses to dig more than 3,000 li of firebreaks and more than 1,000 li of fire prevention ditches within a few days. The people expressed great satisfaction with these things done by the public security organs.

Public security organs and public security personnel in various places also specially analyzed the current situation of the struggle against the enemy in the leap forward. They believe that the social order in our country is very good now, which has never been seen in Chinese history, and capitalist countries are even more beyond reach. After successive suppression of counter-revolutionaries and social reform movements, especially after the socialist revolution has achieved great victories in the economy, politics, and ideology, the counter-revolutionary forces have been basically eliminated, and other bad elements have also been severely打击, and many have been transformed into new people. Therefore, in terms of social security, many counties and cities without outstanding cases and many factories, mines, and enterprises that have not had major sabotage accidents for one year or even several years have emerged. However, the international and domestic class struggles still exist, and a few counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements are still carrying out sabotage and disruption, and their activities are becoming increasingly concealed and cunning. At the same time, the transformation of some landlords, rich peasants, and bourgeois rightists who have not been transformed is still a long-term process, and some of them may still carry out sabotage and disruption before they are completely transformed. Therefore, public security organs and public security personnel are determined to continue to be vigilant and be ready to give the counter-revolutionaries and the destructive activities of various criminals a timely and crushing blow. The public security organs fully estimate that the struggle against the enemies of the people is a long-term and complex struggle; it is also fully estimated that it is an arduous historical task to transform counter-revolutionaries and other various bad elements into self-reliant and kind laborers. Now, under the leadership of the Party, public security organs and public security personnel across the country are continuing to deepen the struggle against waste and conservatism, resolutely oppose the work style of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, completely eliminate the officialdom, decadence, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, make public security work more closely rely on the masses, more actively prevent and combat enemy sabotage, and continue to compare efforts, compare advances, compare measures, and compare effectiveness in various tasks, in order to create a better social order in the struggle to defend the great leap forward of socialism.

    公安人员比先进比措施比实效
    保障祖国安全跃进
    新华社16日讯　各地公安机关在工农业生产大跃进的鼓舞和推动之下，已经掀起了一个公安工作大跃进的热潮。广大的公安人员在党的领导下，举起了保卫社会主义建设大跃进的旗帜，正在鼓足干劲、依靠群众、加强政治、加强业务，为工农业生产大跃进和文化大跃进创造更加良好的社会秩序而努力奋斗。
    各地公安机关跃进的劲头是很足的。他们从各方面采取了各种具体措施，来推进公安工作的大跃进。贵州省为了实现公安工作的跃进，要求做到“三快”、“三好”、“三保证”。“三快”是：情况反映快，经验总结快，问题解决快。“三好”是：工作质量好，联系群众好，同兄弟部门协作好。“三保证”是：保证深入下层、面向实际；保证谦虚谨慎，不骄不娇；保证兢兢业业不怕困难。许多公安机关提出要“走出办公室，加强第一线”。河北、湖南、内蒙古自治区、河南、四川、云南、贵州等省公安机关组织了许多工作组，分别由厅长、副厅长、处长、局长等领导干部率领，深入基层，同基层干部一起努力做好社会治安工作，促使公安工作大跃进。
    目前，各地公安机关抓住了公安工作中当前的主要问题作为工作跃进的纲，广泛地深入贯彻群众路线，针对每项具体任务，努力谋求最先进和最有效的措施，因而使工作有了新的成绩。有些地方过去有些未破获的大案、难案和长期未破的积案，在跃进当中很快获得解决。例如甘肃省公安厅由于领导亲自动手，在十天当中破获了一起数年来大量投寄反动信件、盗窃国家机密的反革命要案。山西太原市北城分局，由副局长亲率干部和民警，密切联系群众，几天内连续破获作案多年的“地老鼠”和“草上飞”两个大盗犯。许多地方的公安机关，对于一般性的盗窃案件，采取向群众公布案情，发动群众协助破案的办法，使案子破获得又快又准确。
    打击外逃反革命分子和流窜作案的刑事犯罪分子工作的效果也很显著。很多地方还存在有少数这类分子，最近河南、山东、江苏、浙江、广东、上海、四川、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等地，先后开展了这个斗争。由于党委的密切领导，广大群众的积极支持，地区之间的协同作战，因而迅速地准确地使一批有严重罪恶的外逃反革命分子和流窜作案的刑事犯罪分子落网。许多地方由于这个问题解决得好，入春以来没有发生任何破坏，如郑州车站、北京车站等处，春节以后一件偷窃案子都没有发生，群众非常称赞。
    在改造不法地主、富农分子和受过宽大处理的反革命分子以及坏分子的工作中，不少公安机关采取了开办短期训练班的形式，每天利用业余时间，对这些人进行政策教育和守法教育，同时督促他们好好劳动。通过这些教育，对于改造这些分子的反动思想，使他们认识自己过去对社会和人民的危害，选择自己应走的光明前途，都起了很好的作用。
    各地公安机关在大跃进中提出：全体公安干部和人民警察要努力提高共产主义的思想觉悟，钻研自己的业务，当好人民群众的警卫员和勤务员。最近在这方面也出现不少的模范事迹。上海、北京等市公安派出所和户籍民警为了使群众方便，采取二十四小时轮流办公的办法，群众非常欢迎。武汉市公安局为了防止火灾，动员人民警察帮助群众修理烟囱、改造炉灶。贵州省公安机关为了做好贵州东南部护林防火工作，几天内发动群众挖了防火线三千多里，防火沟一千多里。人民群众对公安机关办的这些事表示很满意。
    各地公安机关和公安人员在跃进当中，还特别分析了当前对敌斗争的形势，他们认为：现在我国的社会秩序是很好的，是中国历史上从来没有过的，资本主义国家更是望尘莫及。在经过历次镇反运动和社会改革运动以后，特别是社会主义革命在经济上、政治上和思想上都取得伟大胜利之后，反革命势力已经基本肃清了，其他各种坏分子也受到沉重的打击，并且有很多已经被改造成为新人。因此，在社会治安方面，已经出现了很多没有积案的县、市和很多一年以至几年没有发生重大破坏事故的厂矿、企业。但是目前国际和国内阶级斗争都还存在，少数反革命分子和其他坏分子还在进行破坏和捣乱，而且活动日益隐蔽和狡猾。同时，还有一些没有被改造过来的反共、反人民、反社会主义的地主分子、富农分子和资产阶级右派分子的改造，还是一个长期的过程，他们当中的这一些或那一些人在没有得到彻底改造以前，也还可能进行破坏和捣乱。因此，公安机关和公安人员决心继续提高警惕，随时准备给反革命分子和各种犯罪分子的破坏活动及时地予以粉碎性的打击。公安机关充分地估计到了同人民的敌人所进行的斗争，是一个长期的复杂的斗争；也充分地估计到要把反革命分子和其他各种坏分子改造成为自食其力的善良的劳动者，更是一个艰巨的历史任务。现在，全国公安机关和公安人员，正在党的领导下，继续深入反浪费，反保守的斗争，坚决反掉主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义的作风，彻底打掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，使公安工作更加紧密地依靠群众，更加积极地防范和打击敌人的破坏，继续在各项工作上比干劲、比先进、比措施、比实效，为了在保卫社会主义大跃进的斗争中创造更好的社会秩序而努力。
