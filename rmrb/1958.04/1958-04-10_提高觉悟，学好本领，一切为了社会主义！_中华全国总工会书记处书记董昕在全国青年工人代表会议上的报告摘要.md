In recent years, with the development of China's socialist construction, a large number of young people have joined the ranks of the working class, and a large number of young people will continue to join the ranks of the working class every year in the future. Young workers are the fresh blood of China's working class. Our vast number of young workers have grown up under the cultivation and education of the Chinese Communist Party. They are full of vigor, enthusiastic about learning, and willing to accept new things. They all have a certain level of education and can quickly learn and master technology. Together with adult and elderly workers, they have made tremendous contributions to socialist revolution and socialist construction. From 1953 to 1957, young workers across the country put forward 2.05 million rationalization proposals, of which those that have been implemented and can be calculated in value are worth more than 300 million yuan. 100,000 young workers across the country organized 12,000 youth supervision posts to promptly expose and criticize bureaucracy and unreasonable phenomena in enterprises, and put forward suggestions for improvement. Since 1953, one million young workers across the country have been elected as advanced producers, advanced workers, or model workers. In the nationwide rectification movement and the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the vast number of young workers, together with adult and elderly workers, have followed the example of the advanced, and formulated their own advanced plans. Triumphant reports of breaking quotas, creating new records, and leaping forward again and again are coming from every corner of the country almost every moment. In the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, young workers across the country organized tens of thousands of youth shock brigades. In the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, they actively exposed various waste and conservative phenomena in enterprises. Young workers are an important force that must be relied upon in China's socialist construction.

Young Workers Must Undergo Ideological Remolding

The reason why young workers must undergo ideological remolding is that they generally lack knowledge of the struggle for production and experience in class struggle, and most young workers come from families of small producers, and a few come from families of the exploiting classes, so they cannot but bring non-proletarian ideas and are easily influenced by bourgeois ideology. Therefore, ideological remolding is a serious task placed before young workers. The so-called ideological remolding is to destroy bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology, that is, to establish a communist outlook on life of "everyone for me, I for everyone" among young workers, that is, to correctly solve the problem of for whom to labor. The working class is the class that takes the liberation of all mankind as its responsibility, and is the most selfless class in human history. Labor, for us, is a glorious, heroic, and bold undertaking. We engage in all kinds of labor to build our country into a strong socialist country and to realize communism in our country. With such a great goal of struggle in front of us, we can not be afraid of hardship, not avoid danger, never be satisfied, and move forward courageously. At present, the movement of comparing with the advanced and comparing with more, faster, better, and more economical has been vigorously launched among workers across the country. The revolutionary enthusiasm of young workers is extremely high, but among a few young workers, due to a lack of due understanding of the issue of "for whom to labor," they have not played their due role in production. This is worthy of our attention. Accelerating socialist construction requires each of us to make the greatest effort, which requires young workers to be people with ideals, ambition, broad vision, open minds, and full of energy, not people without ideals, no ambition, short-sighted, narrow-minded, and lack of energy.

Young workers do not understand: no matter what position you are in, as long as you do what the people need you to do well, you will be respected by the people and valued by the Party and the government. You are the most glorious, most promising, and most respectable person. At present, a trend of valuing physical labor has begun to take shape among young workers, and this trend should be further promoted in the future. Our construction of a socialist society requires every worker and farmer to have a certain level of education. We now advocate the combination of mental and physical labor, and in the future, we will gradually eliminate the significant differences between mental and physical labor, so that everyone becomes a worker with a high level of education. Looking down on labor, especially physical labor, is a manifestation of the exploiting classes' ideas of idleness and enjoyment. Loving labor and being happy to engage in any work needed by the people is the noble idea of the working class and all working people to create a happy life through their own labor. We must aspire to be good workers who labor for socialism and serve the people; aspire to be good workers with culture and technology.

Correctly Solve the Problem of Laboring for Whom

Building socialism is the most fundamental interest of China's working class and the people of the whole country. The interests of our country and the interests of the people of the whole country are consistent. The bourgeoisie emphasizes personal interests above all else and talks about individualism. The working class emphasizes overall interests above all else and talks about collectivism. Personal interests are realized in the realization of overall interests. All conscious workers subordinate personal interests to overall interests. This is the manifestation of the working class's selfless ideology and the communist attitude towards labor that we should greatly promote. However, among our young workers, not everyone can correctly handle the relationship between national interests and personal interests. There are still some people who put personal interests first and always want to "do less and get more." Some individuals even engage in fraud and harm others for personal gain. All of these are not the ideas of the working class, but the selfish individualism of the bourgeoisie. Having this kind of thinking makes it impossible for oneself to progress; having this kind of thinking inevitably affects the enthusiasm for production. Therefore, this kind of thinking is extremely detrimental to socialist construction. To have a communist attitude toward labor, we must put national interests and overall interests first, entrust our personal happy life to the development and prosperity of the entire society, and work tirelessly to accelerate the building of a prosperous and strong socialist motherland.

Socialist discipline is based on the interests of the majority. Young workers must consciously strengthen their organization and discipline and overcome the ideas and habits of liberalism. In this way, they can, together with adult and elderly workers, shoulder the responsibility of the leading class.

In order for young workers to play a greater role in the entire socialist construction in the future, young workers must not only criticize others in the current socialist education and anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, but also conduct strict self-examination, conduct self-criticism, and strengthen their training in the fire of rectification, and strive to profoundly solve the fundamental question of "for whom to labor" and "for whom to serve." Only through repeated self-education and serious ideological remolding, and resolutely and thoroughly eliminating the selfish and self-interested ideas of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, can the communist outlook on life of laboring for socialism and serving the people be firmly established.

Continuously Improve Cultural and Technical Levels

While striving to improve their awareness and establish a communist attitude towards labor, young workers must also work hard to learn skills well and continuously improve their cultural and technical levels. In recent years, under the care and cultivation of the Party, the cultural and technical levels of young workers have been greatly improved, but they are still far from meeting our needs for building socialism. Our enthusiasm and desire to build socialism can only truly become a force when we master technology and engage in effective labor. All scientific and technological knowledge is created from the practice of production labor. We must learn production experience and technical knowledge in production practice and extensively carry out technical mutual assistance and amateur technical learning activities. Young workers must unite the improvement of political awareness with the mastery of cultural and technical knowledge, oppose the phenomenon of "devoting oneself to technical research without asking about politics," and also oppose the phenomenon of talking glibly about politics without studying cultural and technical knowledge diligently. Every young worker must strive to train himself to be a person who works diligently for socialism and wholeheartedly serves the people, and who loves his job and is proficient in his business and technology, that is, to achieve both red and expert, red and deep expert.

The practice of the Great Leap Forward in production has proved that technological innovation is the basic way to improve social productivity. Because only by improving technology, improving tools, improving operating methods, and adopting new technologies can labor productivity be greatly improved. Technological innovation is the requirement of the vast number of workers in the Great Leap Forward in production, and it is also the requirement of young workers. Physical strength always has a certain limit, and we must use our brains and think of ways to study how to improve and improve technology. We must dare to think, dare to do, and dare to overcome difficulties. People are the decisive factor in all great undertakings. Only by launching a great leap forward in production technology on the basis of the great leap forward in political ideology can there be a continuous great leap forward in production. Only with politics plus technology, enthusiasm plus wisdom, can we build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Respect Old Workers, Learn from Old Workers with an Open Mind

Young workers must also respect old workers and learn from old workers with an open mind. Old workers are the backbone of our working class and the backbone of socialist construction. They have experienced the tempering of political struggle and production struggle, have rich experience, are highly aware, and have a firm stand. They labor selflessly for socialism, work diligently and love the factory like their own home. They do not compare themselves with others in terms of treatment or enjoyment, but compare themselves with others in terms of their contributions to the revolutionary cause and their hard work and simplicity. Old workers have personally experienced the suffering of life in the old society and feel the happiness of life in the new society particularly deeply. They have clear-cut political love and hatred, love socialism and the Communist Party, and hate capitalism and all counter-revolutionaries. We must inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the working class, learn from the production experience of old workers, learn from the spirit of hard work and overcoming difficulties of old workers, and learn from the virtues of hard work, simplicity, modesty, and prudence of old workers. We must be diligent and thrifty, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and resolutely oppose the bourgeois ideas of seeking enjoyment and the corrupt and decadent bourgeois way of life. We must accept all the good things from old workers in order to shoulder the responsibility of the leading class together with old workers.

Continuously improving class consciousness is the most fundamental prerequisite for us to learn skills well and contribute to building socialism. Therefore, young workers must always pay attention to the study of current affairs and politics; must actively participate in organizational life and collective activities of the masses, constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism; constantly fight against various bad tendencies and phenomena that undermine unity, and constantly strengthen the unity of young workers themselves, the unity of all workers, and the unity with the vast number of peasant brothers. As a trade union organization of the communist school, especially in the newly built enterprises where there are many young workers, it must strengthen its work for young workers. The trade union should not only give enthusiastic care to young workers, but also give them serious education, so that young workers can truly be trained to become class fighters with awareness, organization, and discipline.

    提高觉悟，学好本领，一切为了社会主义！
    中华全国总工会书记处书记董昕在全国青年工人代表会议上的报告摘要
    几年来，随着我国社会主义建设事业的发展，大批青年走进了工人阶级的队伍，今后每年还将有很大数量的青年继续走进工人阶级的队伍。青年职工是我国工人阶级的新鲜血液。我们的广大青年职工是在中国共产党的培养教育下成长起来的，他们朝气蓬勃，热心学习，勇于接受新鲜事物。他们都有一定的文化程度，能够比较快地学会和掌握技术。他们和成年、老年职工一起，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中作出了巨大的贡献。从1953年到1957年，全国青年职工提出的合理化建议有二百零五万件，仅其中已经实现并且可以计算价值的在三亿元以上。全国有十万青年职工组织了一万二千个青年监督岗，对企业中的官僚主义和不合理现象及时地进行了揭发、批评，并且提出了改进的建议。从1953年以来，全国已经有一百万青年职工当选为先进生产者、先进工作者或劳动模范。在全民整风运动和工农业生产大跃进中，广大青年职工和成年、老年职工一起，纷纷向先进看齐，订出了自己的先进计划。突破定额、创造新纪录、跃进再跃进的捷报，几乎每时每刻都在全国各个角落传来。在反浪费、反保守运动中，全国青年职工组织了数以万计的青年突击队。他们本着勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的精神，积极地揭发了企业中的各种浪费和保守现象。青年职工是我国社会主义建设中的一支必需依靠的重要力量。
    青年职工必须进行思想改造
    青年职工之所以必须进行思想改造，是因为他们一般地还缺乏生产斗争的知识和阶级斗争的锻炼，而且多数青年职工出身于小生产者的家庭，还有少数人出身于剥削阶级的家庭，就不能不带来非无产阶级的思想和容易受到资产阶级思想的影响。因此，思想改造是摆在青年职工面前的一个严重任务。所谓思想改造，就是要破资产阶级思想，立无产阶级思想，就是要在青年职工中建立起“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义的人生观，也就是要正确地解决为谁劳动的问题。工人阶级是以解放全人类为己任的阶级，是人类历史上最大公无私的阶级。劳动，对我们来说，是一种光荣的、英勇的、豪迈的事业。我们从事各种各样的劳动，就是要把我国建设成为一个社会主义的强国，就是要在我国实现共产主义。在我们的面前树立起这样伟大的奋斗目标，我们就能不怕辛劳、不避险阻、永不满足、勇往直前。目前，比先进，比多快好省的运动，在全国职工中已经蓬蓬勃勃地展开，青年职工革命干劲极为高昂，但是在少数的青年职工中，由于对“为谁劳动”的问题缺乏应有的认识，他们在生产上还没有发挥应有的作用。这是值得我们注意的。加速社会主义建设要求我们每个人做出最大的努力，这就要求青年职工做有理想、有志气、目光远大、胸怀开阔、干劲十足的人，不要做没理想、没志气、目光短浅、胸怀狭窄、干劲不大的人。
    青年工人不了解：不论你在什么岗位上，只要把人民需要你做的事做好，就会受到人们的尊敬，就会受到党和政府的器重，你就是最光荣、最有前途、最体面的人。目前在青年职工中已经开始树立起重视体力劳动的风气，今后要把这种风气进一步发扬起来。我们建设社会主义社会，要求每一个工人农民都有一定的文化水平。我们现在提倡脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合，在将来还要逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的重大差别，使人人成为具有高度文化水平的劳动者。轻视劳动，特别是轻视体力劳动，是剥削阶级好逸恶劳、坐享其成的思想影响的表现。热爱劳动、乐于从事人民所需要的任何工作，这是工人阶级和一切劳动人民依靠自己的劳动去创造幸福生活的高尚思想。我们要立志做一个为社会主义劳动、为人民服务的好工人；立志做一个有文化有技术的好工人。
    正确解决为谁劳动的问题
    建设社会主义是我国工人阶级和全国人民最根本的利益。我们国家的利益和全国人民的利益是一致的。资产阶级讲个人利益至上，讲的是个人主义。工人阶级讲整体利益至上，讲的是集体主义。在实现整体利益中来实现个人利益。一切有觉悟的工人，都把个人利益服从整体利益。这就是我们工人阶级大公无私的思想表现，也是我们应该大大提倡的共产主义的劳动态度。可是，在我们青年职工当中，并不是每个人都能够正确处理国家利益和个人利益的关系的。还有这么一些人，把个人利益放在第一位，总想“少做些，多拿些”。甚至有个别人为了争取个人荣誉而做出弄虚作假和损人利己的事情来。所有这些，都不是工人阶级的思想，而是资产阶级自私自利的个人主义思想。有了这种思想，就使自己不能进步；有了这种思想，就必然影响生产积极性，因此这种思想对社会主义建设是极为不利的。我们要有共产主义的劳动态度，就必须要把国家利益、整体利益放在第一位，把个人的幸福生活寄托在整个社会的发展繁荣之上，努力不懈地为加速建成繁荣富强的社会主义祖国而劳动。
    社会主义的纪律是以多数人的利益为依据的，青年职工必须自觉地加强自己的组织性和纪律性，克服自由散漫的思想、习气。这样，才能和成年、老年工人一起，担负起领导阶级的责任。
    为了使青年职工在今后社会主义整个建设事业中发挥更大的作用，青年职工在目前正在进行的社会主义教育和反浪费、反保守运动中，不仅要批评别人，也要做严格的自我检查，进行自我批评，在整风的烈火中加强锻炼，力求深刻地解决“为谁劳动”和“为谁服务”这个根本性的问题。只有经过反复的自我教育和严肃认真的思想改造，坚决、彻底地肃清资产阶级、小资产阶级的自私自利的思想，才能够把为社会主义劳动、为人民服务的共产主义的人生观牢固地建立起来。
      不断提高文化技术水平
    青年职工在努力提高觉悟、树立共产主义劳动态度的同时，还必须努力学好本领，不断地提高自己的文化技术水平。几年来，在党的关怀和培养下，青年职工的文化技术水平有了很大提高，可是还远远不能满足我们建设社会主义的需要。我们建设社会主义的热情和愿望只有在掌握技术、进行有成效的劳动下才能真正成为力量。一切科学技术知识都是从生产劳动的实践中创造出来的。我们要在生产实践中学习生产经验和技术知识，广泛地开展技术互助和业余技术学习活动。青年职工要把提高政治觉悟和掌握文化技术知识统一起来，反对“埋头钻研技术、不问政治”的现象，也反对侈谈政治、不刻苦学习文化技术知识的现象。每一个青年职工都要努力把自己锻炼成为既是勤勤恳恳地为社会主义劳动、全心全意为人民服务的人，又是热爱本行工作、精通本行业务和技术的人，也就是做到又红又专、红透专深。
    生产大跃进的实践证明，革新技术是提高社会生产力的基本途径。因为只有改进技术，改进工具，改进操作方法，采用新技术，才能大大地提高劳动生产率。革新技术是生产大跃进中广大职工的要求，也是青年职工的要求。体力总是有一定限度的，必须动脑筋，想办法研究提高和改进技术。我们要敢想，敢做，勇于克服困难，人就是一切伟大事业的决定因素。在政治思想大跃进的基础上掀起生产技术上的大跃进，才能有生产上不断的大跃进。只有政治加技术、热情加智慧，我们才能够做到又多又快又好又省地建成社会主义。
  尊重老工人，虚心向老工人学习
    青年职工还必须尊重老工人，虚心地向老工人学习。老工人是我们工人阶级的骨干，社会主义建设的骨干。他们经历了政治斗争和生产斗争的锻炼，经验丰富，觉悟较高，立场坚定。他们为社会主义而忘我地劳动，勤勤恳恳，爱厂如家。他们不与别人比待遇、比享受，而与别人比对革命事业的贡献，比艰苦朴素。老工人亲身经历过旧社会生活的痛苦，对新社会的生活幸福感受得特别深刻。他们在政治上爱憎分明，热爱社会主义和共产党。仇恨资本主义和一切反革命。我们要继承和发扬工人阶级的优良传统，学习老工人的生产经验，要学习老工人艰苦奋斗、克服困难的精神，学习老工人勤俭朴素、谦虚谨慎的美德，我们要克勤克俭、戒骄戒躁，坚决反对贪图享受的资产阶级思想和腐化堕落的资产阶级生活方式。我们必须把老工人身上所有的好东西都接受过来，才能和老工人一起担当起领导阶级的责任。
    不断地提高阶级觉悟是我们学好本领，为建设社会主义贡献力量的最根本的前提。因此，青年职工必须经常地注意时事政治的学习；必须积极地参加组织生活和群众的集体活动，经常地开展批评和自我批评；经常地向各种不良倾向和破坏团结的现象作斗争，不断地加强青年职工本身的团结、和全体职工的团结以及和广大农民弟兄的团结。作为共产主义学校的工会组织，特别是在青年职工很多的新建企业中的工会组织，必须加强对青年职工的工作。工会对青年职工既要给以热情的关怀，又要对他们有严肃的教育，使得青年职工真正锻炼成为有觉悟、有组织、有纪律的阶级战士。
