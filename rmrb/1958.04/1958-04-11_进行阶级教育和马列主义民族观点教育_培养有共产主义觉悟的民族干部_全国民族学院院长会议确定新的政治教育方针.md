Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Education recently jointly convened a Nationalities Institute Presidents' Conference to discuss how to focus on conducting class education and Marxist-Leninist nationalities view education in nationalities institutes in the future. The conference believes that the new political education guiding principle put forward by the Party is of great significance to the rapid growth of communist cadres from all minority nationalities in our country.

The conference believes that the political education conducted by various schools training minority nationality cadres in the past focused on patriotism and national unity education. It was entirely correct and necessary to do so in the past period.

The conference pointed out that with the rapid development of socialist revolution and socialist construction throughout the country, the face of the vast majority of minority nationality areas has undergone fundamental changes. The unity among all nationalities has been greatly strengthened; over 90% of the minority nationality population living in concentrated communities has implemented national regional autonomy; and over 85% of the minority nationality population has basically realized the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production. Under this new situation, there is an urgent need to further cultivate a large number of communist political cadres who can withstand any risks, have cultural knowledge, and possess professional skills. Therefore, it is necessary for schools training minority nationality cadres to change their original political education guiding principle and adopt a new political education guiding principle that focuses on conducting class education and Marxist-Leninist nationalities view education in the future.

In order to rapidly implement the Party's new political education guiding principle, the Nationalities Institutes will focus on enrolling students from the working class and laboring people in the first half of this year; rectify the teaching staff, implement the principle of linking theory with practice and combining study with labor; and implement the principle of combining political thought with teaching work. The rectification movement will be further implemented in the Nationalities Institutes to criticize local nationalism. The principle of running schools diligently and thriftily will be resolutely implemented to change the phenomenon of students receiving excessively high treatment.

Liu Chun, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, made a concluding speech at the meeting. He pointed out that in the future, class education and Marxist-Leninist nationalities view education should be emphasized among minority nationalities to enable them to establish a communist worldview and outlook on life, firmly stand on the proletariat's position, and be able to correctly understand and implement the Party and the state's political line and various policies. In this way, they will not lose their way in any complex situation and will always persist in struggling for the cause of revolution.

    进行阶级教育和马列主义民族观点教育
    培养有共产主义觉悟的民族干部
    全国民族学院院长会议确定新的政治教育方针
    据新华社10日讯　中华人民共和国民族事务委员会、教育部最近联合召开全国民族学院院长会议，讨论在民族学院中今后如何着重进行阶级教育和马克思列宁主义民族观点教育的问题。会议认为，党提出的这一新的政治教育方针，对于我国各少数民族共产主义干部的迅速成长具有重大意义。
    会议认为，过去各个培养少数民族干部的学校所进行的政治教育，都着重爱国主义和民族团结的教育，在过去一个时期这样作是完全正确和必要的。
    会议指出，随着全国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的迅速发展，绝大多数的少数民族地区面貌已经发生了根本性的变化。各民族间的团结已大大加强；90％以上聚居的少数民族人口实行了民族区域自治；85％以上的少数民族人口基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造。在这个新的形势下，就迫切需要进一步培养出大批经得起任何风险的、有文化水平的和有专业能力的共产主义的政治干部。因此，培养少数民族干部的学校有必要改变原来的政治教育方针，今后采取着重进行阶级教育和马克思列宁主义民族观点教育的新的政治教育方针。
    为了迅速贯彻党的新的政治教育方针，各民族学院在今年上半年内，即着重招收工人阶级和劳动人民出身的学员；整顿教师队伍，贯彻理论联系实际、学习和劳动相结合的原则；贯彻政治思想和教学工作相结合的原则。并在民族学院中进一步贯彻整风运动，批判地方民族主义。坚决贯彻勤俭办学的方针，改变学生待遇偏高的现象。
    民族事务委员会副主任刘春在会议上作总结发言。他指出：今后在少数民族中要着重进行阶级教育和马克思列宁主义民族观点的教育，使他们树立起共产主义的世界观和人生观，站稳无产阶级的立场，能够正确体会和执行党和国家的政治路线和各项政策，这样他们就不会在任何复杂情况下迷失方向，就会永远为革命事业坚持奋斗。
