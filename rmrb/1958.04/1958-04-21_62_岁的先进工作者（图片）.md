    The 62-Year-Old Advanced Worker
    Song Xiangru, a sixty-two-year-old veteran service worker at the Tongrentang Pharmacy in Dashilar, Beijing, is an advanced worker at Tongrentang. For nine years, he has never made a mistake in identifying medicinal materials or answering questions. In terms of service attitude, he roasts and applies plasters for customers, pours boiled water for those taking medicine, and treats customers like family. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Chunde photographed this.
