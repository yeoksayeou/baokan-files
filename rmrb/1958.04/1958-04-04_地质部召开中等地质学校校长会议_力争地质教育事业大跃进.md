The Ministry of Geology convened a meeting of the principals of its affiliated secondary geological schools.

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Ministry of Geology convened a meeting of principals of secondary geological schools at the end of March.

    The meeting unanimously agreed that implementing the teaching principle of combining education with production can achieve the four-way combination of politics and technology, theory and practice, manual labor and mental labor, and intellectuals and workers-peasants, so as to cultivate geological talents who are both red and expert to meet the needs of the great leap forward in geological work.

    Under the slogan of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced," each school put forward plans and leap forward targets for running schools diligently and thriftily, such as "working hard for three years to strive for self-sufficiency in most or all aspects." In 1958, Wuhan Geological School can be completely self-sufficient; Changchun Geological School can be self-sufficient for 83.29% of its funding; and Xi'an Geological School can be self-sufficient for 70%. The remaining schools can achieve self-sufficiency in funding by 40%-65% this year. The meeting believed that in order to closely integrate teaching with production and improve teaching quality, the direction of production should be mainly to participate in geological production in combination with the major, and to actively develop agricultural and sideline production. Schools with the necessary conditions can form their own work teams and independently accept production tasks.

    In accordance with the new spirit of education combining with production, in terms of the teaching process, it was decided that the first grade will implement a system of one month of vacation, three months of production labor, and eight months of theoretical teaching. For each higher grade thereafter, the production labor time will be increased by one month, and the theoretical teaching time will be reduced by one month. A new method of teaching in the field is advocated, so that some courses that can be carried out in the field can be learned while working during production and practice, consolidating theoretical knowledge and improving operational skills, so as to closely integrate theory with practice and teaching with production.

    In order to do more with less money, the meeting decided that the ten geological schools will increase enrollment by 76.7% on the basis of the original enrollment plan for 1958 without increasing infrastructure, teachers, or investment.

    地质部召开中等地质学校校长会议
    力争地质教育事业大跃进
    本报讯　地质部于3月下旬，召开了所属中等地质学校校长会议。
    会议一致认为，贯彻实行教育与生产相结合的教学方针，可以做到政治与技术、理论与实际、体力劳动与脑力劳动、知识分子与工农的四个方面的结合，达到培养又红又专的地质人材的目的，以适应地质工作大跃进的需要。
    会议在比先进、学先进、赶先进的口号下，各学校提出了“苦战三年，争取大部或全部自给”等三勤办学的规划及跃进指标。在1958年度，武汉地质学校可以全部自给自足；长春地质学校可以自给经费83.29％；西安地质学校可以自给70％。其余各校均可于今年自给经费40％—65％。会议认为，为使教学与生产紧密结合，提高教学质量，生产方向应以结合专业参加地质生产为主，并积极开展农副业生产，有条件的学校，可以自组工作队，单独接受生产任务。
    根据新的教育结合生产的精神，在教学进程上，决定一年级实行一个月假期，三个月生产劳动，八个月理论教学的制度。以后每高一年级，生产劳动时间增加一个月，理论教学时间减少一个月。提倡野外进行教学的新方式，使某些可以在野外进行的课程，在生产及实习的过程中，边作边学，巩固理论知识，提高操作技能，使理论与实际、教学与生产紧密地结合起来。
    会议为了要做到少花钱，多办事决定，十所地质学校在不增加基建设备、师资与投资的原则下，在1958年原订招生计划的基础上增招学生76.7％。
