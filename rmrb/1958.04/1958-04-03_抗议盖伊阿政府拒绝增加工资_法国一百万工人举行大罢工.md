Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 1st: One million state-owned enterprise workers in France went on a 24-hour strike today to protest the government's refusal to increase wages. The strike included employees from the railway, gas, electricity, and Paris public transportation sectors. According to union leaders, the discontent among French workers has reached its highest point since the 1953 strike movement.

	At four o'clock this morning, train drivers on various lines drove their trains into the nearest stations and stopped working along with other railway workers. Reports from various regions indicate that railway transportation throughout France has almost completely halted.

	In Paris, subway stations had their gates tightly shut. No buses were running on the streets, gas pressure dropped, electricity weakened, and some areas even experienced power outages. Because ground staff of Air France participated in the strike, air transport between France and various parts of Europe was completely disrupted.

	Employees of police stations, sanitation workers, and funeral workers also joined the strike today.

	The strike was jointly initiated by the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), and the General Confederation of Executive Staffs (CGC). The Socialist Party's union "Workers' Force" also issued a strike call. The unions are demanding wage increases to cope with rising living costs. However, Prime Minister Gaillard and Finance Minister Pflimlin rejected this demand. Their excuse is that when France recently paid the United States and Europe 650 million U.S. dollars in allied loans, it promised not to exceed a budget deficit of 400 million U.S. dollars this year. If wages are increased, the deficit will exceed this limit.

    抗议盖伊阿政府拒绝增加工资
    法国一百万工人举行大罢工
    据新华社1日讯　巴黎消息：法国今天有一百万国营企业工人罢工二十四小时，抗议政府拒绝增加工资。参加罢工的包括铁路、煤气、电力和巴黎公共交通部门的职工。据工会领袖指出，目前法国工人当中的不满情绪已经达到1953年的罢工运动以来的最高峰。
    今天清晨四点钟，奔驰在各线路上的火车司机就把车开进最近的车站，然后同其他工种的铁路工人一起停止工作。来自各地的消息说，法国各地的铁路运输几乎全部停顿。
    在巴黎，地下电车站紧闭着闸门。街道上也没有一辆公共汽车行驶，煤气压力下降了，电力接着也减弱了，有些地区甚至断了电。由于法国航空公司的地勤人员参加罢工，法国同欧洲各地的空运完全中断。
    警察局的雇员、清洁工人和殡葬工人今天也参加了罢工的行列。
    这次罢工是由总工会、天主教劳工联盟和职工总联合会共同发起的。社会党的工会“工人力量”也发出了罢工号召。工会要求增加工资，以应付生活费用的高涨。但是总理盖伊阿和财政部长弗林姆兰拒绝了这个要求。他们的借口是：法国最近向美国和欧洲支付同盟借款六亿五千万美元时曾经答应不使今年的预算赤字超过四亿美元。如果增加工资，赤字就要超过这个限额。
