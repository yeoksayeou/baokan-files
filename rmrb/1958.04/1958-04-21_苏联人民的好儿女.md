    Good Children of the Soviet People
    By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang
    The Thirteenth Congress of the Soviet Komsomol has concluded.
    The Thirteenth Congress of the Soviet Komsomol can be called a "gathering of heroes" of Soviet youth. In his concluding report, Shelepin spoke about the contributions of the Soviet Komsomol on all fronts of communist construction over the past four years, and cited many heroic deeds of outstanding Komsomol members. From these deeds, we once again saw the excellent qualities of Soviet youth.
    Shelepin mentioned Viktor Golunov, a sophomore in the Law Department of Moscow University. He is a person who unfortunately lost both legs, but he did not lose heart at all. He showed great strength and optimism in his studies and life. Last summer, when all the students went to the newly cultivated areas to help with the harvest, he also asked to participate, but the school did not approve in order to take care of him. However, he was unwilling to fall behind everyone in such a job, so he took the train himself and rushed to the new reclaimed area, where he worked in the threshing ground for a summer. His strong work spirit moved everyone, and the comrades all said he was "the second Meresjev."
    Shelepin also read a letter in his report, which was written to the Central Committee of the Komsomol by the graduates of Cheremshan Middle School in the "May 1st" district of the Tatar Autonomous Republic. The twenty-two middle school graduates who wrote the letter requested that they be sent to the eastern region to participate in construction work, and the head teacher Klebanov was also prepared to go with them. After reading this letter, Shelepin said that the Central Committee of the Soviet Komsomol suggested that the Thirteenth Congress issue a call to the youth of the country to send another one million people to the eastern region to participate in various construction projects.
    As soon as this suggestion was published in the newspaper, young people from all over responded immediately. Twenty graduating students from the Moscow Transport Institute wrote to "Komsomolskaya Pravda," requesting that they be sent to Siberia to participate in the construction of new railways.
    The Soviet Komsomol has a traditional slogan for action: If the Party says "need to do," then the Komsomol answers "we go!". When the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party proposed to catch up with the United States in terms of per capita production of milk, meat, and oils, many Komsomol members resolutely took up animal husbandry posts.
    Katya Rachyunnina just graduated from a ten-year school last year, but her name has now spread throughout the country. The cows she raised produced 6,000 kilograms of milk per head last year. However, Rachyunnina is not satisfied with this achievement. At this conference, she proposed to increase the milk production per cow to 7,000 kilograms this year. In order to achieve greater results in animal husbandry, the Congress recommended sending another 500,000 people to participate in animal husbandry production before 1959.
    What has been discussed here is only a small part of the Soviet Komsomol members. There are many outstanding young workers in various positions. They are completing the tasks put forward by the Party with great enthusiasm and creativity.

    苏联人民的好儿女
    本报记者　崔永昌
    苏联共青团第十三次代表大会已经闭幕了。
    苏联共青团第十三次代表大会可以说是苏联青年的一次“群英会”，谢列平在总结报告中谈到了四年来苏联共青团在共产主义建设各个战线上的贡献，并且举出了许多优秀共青团员的英雄事迹，从这些事迹中我们再一次看到了苏联青年的优秀品质。
    谢列平谈到了莫斯科大学法律系二年级学生维克多·哥利诺夫。他是个不幸失去了双脚的人，但是他一点也没有灰心丧气，他在学习和生活中都表现得非常坚强、乐观。去年夏天当同学们全到新垦区去帮助收割的时候，他也要求参加，但是学校为了照顾他而没有批准。可是他不愿在这样一件工作中落在大家后面，于是他自己乘上火车，赶到新垦地区，在打谷场工作了一夏天。他的坚强的工作精神感动了大家，同志们都说他是“第二个密烈西也夫”。
    谢列平在报告中还宣读了一封信，这是鞑靼自治共和国“五一”区切列木山中学毕业生写给共青团中央的。写信的二十二个中学毕业生要求把他们派到东部地区参加建设工作，班主任克列班诺夫也准备跟他们一起去。谢列平读完这封信说，苏联共青团中央建议十三次代表大会向全国青年发出号召，再派一百万人到东部地区去参加各项建设工作。
    这个建议在报上一发表，各地青年立即响应。莫斯科运输学院二十个应届毕业生写信给“共青团真理报”，要求把他们派到西伯利亚去参加建设新铁路。
    苏联共青团有一个传统的行动口号：如果党说“需要做”，那末共青团就回答说“我们去！”。当苏共中央提出要在牛奶、肉类和油脂的产量按人口平均计算方面赶上美国的时候，许许多多共青团员毅然地走上了畜牧业的工作岗位。
    卡佳·拉秋新娜去年刚从十年制学校毕业，但是她的名字现在已经传遍了全国。她所饲养的奶牛，去年每头产奶量达到六千公斤。但是，拉秋新娜并不满足于这个成绩，在这次大会上她提出：今年要把每头奶牛的产奶量提高到七千公斤。为了在畜牧业方面取得更大的成绩，代表大会建议在1959年以前再派五十万人去参加畜牧业生产。
    这里所谈的只是苏联共青团员中很小的一部分。在各种工作岗位上都有许多优秀的青年工作者。他们都以巨大的热情和创造力完成着党所提出的任务。
