    The Devil is One Foot Tall, the Dao is Ten Feet Tall
    Due to the long-term lack of rain and the lack of water lifting tools, Hebei Province is currently facing great difficulties in planting grain and cotton. However, under such difficult circumstances, the people of Hebei came up with a way to dig a large number of artesian wells, and the effect is very good. It not only greatly supported the fight against drought and saved water lifting tools and manpower and animal power, but also opened up a new water source for farmland irrigation. This situation is really like "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out, the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, and there is another village."
    The people of Hebei digging artesian wells to open up new water sources tells us that in the face of difficulties, people's confidence is a decisive factor; whoever achieves "the Dao is ten feet tall" when "the devil is one foot tall" can overcome difficulties.
    At present, some other areas have also experienced drought. We believe that the people there will be able to resist the drought with strong confidence, just like the people of Hebei.

    魔高一尺，道高十丈
    河北全省因长期不雨，又加以提水工具缺乏，目前播种粮食棉花遭到了很大的困难。但是，河北人民在这样困难的情况下，想出办法大量凿自流泉，效果很好。不仅大大支持了抗旱斗争，节省了提水工具和人力畜力，而且给农田灌溉开辟了一个新水源。这种情况真像“山穷水尽疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”。
    河北人民凿自流泉开辟新水源的事情告诉我们：在困难面前，人的信心是一个决定性的因素；谁在“魔高一尺”的时候作到了“道高十丈”，谁就可以战胜困难。
    目前还有些地区也出现了旱象，我们相信那里的人民也一定同河北人民一样，能以坚强的信心去抗御干旱。
