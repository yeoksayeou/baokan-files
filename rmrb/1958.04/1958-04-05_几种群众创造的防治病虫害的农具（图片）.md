Several Mass-Created Farm Tools for Pest and Disease Control

    Henan Province, Xinxiang County, used an old single-tube sprayer, fixed it inside a water bucket, added wooden sticks to pump air, and installed a tee on the rubber tube to create double spray heads. Two people carry it forward, the person in the back pumps air while walking, and the person in the front controls the spray rod. Two people can spray 1059 liquid 20-25 mu per day, increasing efficiency by 8-10 times, and ensuring the safety of the sprayers.

    Lead Pipe Stem Smearer: Consists of a medicine tube, medicine brush, and handle. Each person can smear 4-6 mu per day. The manufacturing cost is low, and it is easy to use.
