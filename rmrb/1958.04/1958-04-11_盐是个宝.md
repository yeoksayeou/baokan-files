Salt is very useful. It has more than 200 uses in industry, mainly in the alkali industry. For example, salt can be used to make caustic soda, soda ash, and hydrochloric acid, which are the main raw materials for many industries, especially the chemical industry. Salt can also be used to make chlorine, baking soda, and ammonium chloride. Chlorine can be directly used for disinfection, to make bleaching powder, 666, DDT, etc., and it can also be used to decompose metals. Chlorine is also an indispensable raw material for manufacturing rayon, synthetic rubber, and plastics. Ammonium chloride made from salt is a major agricultural fertilizer, and this fertilizer is 30 to 40 times more effective than manure.

The use of salt in agriculture is also increasing day by day. In 1953, the amount of salt used in agriculture was 4,000 tons. Now most farmers use salt for seed selection, and last year the amount of salt used in agriculture has increased to 101,000 tons.

Salt is also very useful in animal husbandry. If some salt is added to livestock feed appropriately, it can increase the appetite of livestock, help digestion, make livestock grow meat faster, make their fur smoother, and increase their resistance to bacteria.

After salt is produced from seawater, a lot of bittern is left, which is a by-product of salt. It contains various elements, including magnesium for the national defense industry, sodium for the glass, papermaking, tanning, dye, and pharmaceutical industries, potassium for fertilizer manufacturing, bromine for the national defense industry to manufacture antiknock agents, and thirty-six elements such as iodine needed by the pharmaceutical industry. Bittern also contains a large amount of rare elements such as lithium, strontium, titanium, and molybdenum. Well salt contains more rare elements such as lithium, strontium, and barium, and mineral salt also contains a large amount of potassium salt. The reserves of potassium salt in Qaidam and Mangya alone are 200 million tons.

Producing 100 tons of sea salt from seawater can produce 100 tons of bittern. Using these bitterns, major by-products such as potassium chloride, halite, bromine, anhydrous magnesium sulfate, anhydrous mirabilite, and edible refined salt can be made. The value of these by-products is equivalent to the output value of 50 tons of sea salt. Comprehensive utilization of resources can not only improve the quality of salt and increase new varieties, but also reduce the cost of salt. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the utilization rate of bittern was only 10%. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the slogan put forward by the salt industry department was: "Every plant should have by-products." It is expected that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the utilization rate of bittern will reach 60%, and the focus will be on rural areas, with a large amount of potassium and magnesium fertilizer extracted.

    盐是个宝
    盐的用途很大，在工业上的用途就有二百多种，其中主要是用在酸碱工业上。例如用盐可以制成烧碱、纯碱、盐酸，这是很多工业、特别是化学工业的主要原料。盐还可以制成氯、小苏打、氯化铵等；氯可以直接用来消毒，制漂白粉，可以制六六六、滴滴涕等，还可以用它来分解金属。氯还是制造人造丝、人造橡胶、塑料等不可缺少的原料。用盐制成的氯化铵是主要的农业肥料，这种肥料的效能比粪肥高三十到四十倍。
    盐在农业上的用途也一天天增多。1953年农业用盐量是四千吨，现在农民大部分用盐来选种，去年农业用盐已经增长到十万一千吨。
    盐在畜牧业上也有很大用处，如果在牲畜的饲料中适当地加些盐，就可以增进牲畜的食欲，帮助消化，使牲畜长肉快，毛光滑，而且能够增加对病菌的抵抗力。
    海水制盐之后，剩下很多苦卤，也就是盐的副产品，里面含有多种元素，其中有供国防工业用的镁，供玻璃、造纸、鞣革、染料、医药工业用的钠，有制造肥料用的钾，有供国防工业制造抗爆剂的溴，和医药工业需要的碘等三十六种元素。苦卤还含有大量的锂、锶、钛、钼等稀有元素。井盐中含的锂、锶、钡等稀有元素更多，矿盐中也含有大量的钾盐。仅柴达木和芒崖两个地方，钾盐的蕴藏量就有二亿吨。
    用海水生产一百吨海盐，就可以生产一百吨苦卤，用这些苦卤，可以制成氯化钾、卤块、溴素、无水硫酸镁、无水芒硝、食用精盐等主要副产品；这些副产品的价值就相当于五十吨海盐的产值。资源的综合利用，不但可以提高盐的质量，增加新品种，而且还可以降低盐的成本。第一个五年计划期间，对苦卤的利用率仅仅达到10％。第二个五年计划，制盐工业部门提出的口号是：“做到场场有副产。”预计第二个五年计划期间，苦卤的利用率将达到60％，并且以面向农村为主，大量提制钾镁肥。
