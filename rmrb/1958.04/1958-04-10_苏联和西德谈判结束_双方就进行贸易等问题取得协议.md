    苏联和西德谈判结束
    双方就进行贸易等问题取得协议
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联和德意志联邦共和国两国政府代表团经过长期谈判以后，8日在莫斯科签订了有关贸易、公民回国、领事等问题的协定和条约。这次谈判是1957年在莫斯科开始举行的。
    据莫斯科发表的谈判结束公报说，这次谈判的内容很详细。在克服了最初的困难以后，议程上的各项问题得到了一致满意的解决。
    在经济方面达成的协议有“贸易和支付长期协定”，“1958年贸易议定书”和“关于贸易和海运一般问题的协定”。
    贸易和支付长期协定规定了1958到1960年三年内的进出口货单，还规定了实现两国间贸易和支付的规则。协定规定，两国间的贸易额每年都要有很大的增加，到1960年将达十二亿卢布左右，比1957年约增加一倍。双方议定的三年商品供应总额约达三十亿卢布左右。
    关于贸易和航海一般问题的协定规定，在关税和其他有关进出口问题上互相给予最惠国的待遇。协定规定苏联在德意志联邦共和国设立商务代表处并确定其法权地位。
    有关两国个别公民离境问题的协议规定，苏联方面将善意地考虑由于个别德国公民申请离开苏联前往德意志联邦共和国而产生的实际问题。德意志联邦共和国当局也将以同样态度对待目前住在西德而愿意前往苏联的苏联公民的这类申请。
    双方声明，将遵循使那些在上次大战中拆散的家庭团圆的原则。各方将根据本国的法律办事。两国红十字会将继续合作。
    双方一致同意的领事条约使两国的领事关系有了条约根据，并且对有效地保护两国公民以及贸易和航行的利益提供了可能性。
    协定由两国政府代表团团长临时签字。正式的签字将于最近时期在波恩举行。
