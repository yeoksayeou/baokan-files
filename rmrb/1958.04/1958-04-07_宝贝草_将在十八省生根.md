Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou Electric Dispatch: The Tianshui Special District in Gansu Province is preparing to supply more than 2 million jin of "precious grass" - sweet clover seeds - to eighteen provinces and cities this year in response to their requests.

Under the slogan "Support one jin with every extra jin, support one liang with every extra liang," the farmers of the Tianshui Special District are selecting the best seeds to send to their distant farmer and herdsman brothers. Purchasing personnel from the commercial departments are going deep into the mountainous areas, adopting the method of collecting seeds while harvesting them, to ensure timely allocation. At the same time, they are also prepared to actively assist the other provinces with cultivation techniques.

Promoting sweet clover is an important measure for the Tianshui Special District to change its arid face. This year, the planting area of ​​sweet clover here has been doubled compared to last year. It plays a significant role in greening barren mountains, conserving water and soil, improving soil, and solving the fuel, feed, and fertilizer difficulties of the masses in poor mountainous areas. Sweet clover seeds can also be used to extract oil, brew wine, make vinegar, make flour, and make honey (the flowers are a good source of honey). The stalks can be peeled for fiber to make ropes. Sweet clover is extremely adaptable and can be planted in various soils all year round. Past trial planting results in some provinces have proven that in the areas of Yulin and Suide in Shaanxi Province, where wind and sand hazards are serious, sweet clover plays a significant role in fixing sand and preventing wind. The local people call it "life grass." In the high-altitude and cold regions of Qinghai and Xinjiang, sweet clover still grows vigorously, with stalks reaching two meters in length.

    “宝贝草”将在十八省生根
    据新华社兰州电　甘肃省天水专区应十八个省市的要求，今年准备供应这些地区“宝贝草”——草木樨籽两百多万斤。
    天水专区农民在“多一斤支援一斤，多一两支援一两”的口号下，把最好的种籽挑选出来送给远方的农牧民兄弟，商业部门的采购人员深入山区，采取边打籽，边收购的方法，保证及时调拨。同时在栽培技术上也准备给外省积极帮助。
    推广草木樨是天水专区改变干旱面貌的一项重要措施。今年这里草木樨的播种面积比去年扩大了两倍。它对绿化荒山、保持水土、改良土壤和解决贫瘠山区群众三料（燃料、饲料、肥料）困难都起了重大作用。草木樨籽还可以榨油、酿酒、制醋、制粉、制蜜（花是很好的蜜源），秆可剥出纤维打绳。草木樨的适应性极强，在各种土壤上一年四季都能种植。过去在有的省份试种结果证明，在风沙危害严重的陕西榆林、绥德地区，草木樨对固沙防风的作用很大，当地群众叫它“生命草”。在高寒的青海、新疆地区，草木樨生长依然十分旺盛，秆长达到两公尺。
