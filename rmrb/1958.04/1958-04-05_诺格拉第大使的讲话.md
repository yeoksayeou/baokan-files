Ambassador Nográdi's Speech

Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, esteemed guests:

Today is the 13th anniversary of Hungary's liberation from German fascist oppression. The glorious Soviet army, after immense sacrifices, crushed the armed forces of the fascist bloc and achieved a great victory of world historical significance, which is why the Hungarian people were liberated. Therefore, all the Hungarian people feel sincere gratitude and love for the great Soviet people who liberated them.

The Hungarian people are a freedom-loving people, and they have proven this more than once in their history. For thirteen years, we have seen that the Hungarian people are able to make use of their freedom; they have taken control of the leadership of the country and distributed the estates of landlords and the church to poor peasants and farm laborers. This abolished the remnants of feudalism and relieved the suffering of tens of thousands of people in the countryside. Due to the nationalization of banks and large-scale industry and commerce, the exploitation of urban working people was eliminated. Thanks to the cultural revolution, culture has become the wealth of all the people. Industrial production has now reached three and a half times the pre-war level, and the number of university students has increased fourfold. The vast majority of them come from worker and peasant backgrounds. The people themselves decide the country's foreign policy, which aims to fight together with other socialist countries and peace-loving countries to avoid the outbreak of new wars and for the peaceful coexistence of all countries.

Therefore, the Hungarian people regard the cause of defending peace as their most sacred task. They wholeheartedly support the Soviet government's measures to repel the war frenzy stirred up by the aggressive blocs, including efforts to ban the use of hydrogen weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, to achieve disarmament, to convene a summit meeting, and all efforts aimed at ensuring that another world war does not occur. The government of the Hungarian People's Republic warmly supports the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Europe, the measures taken by the Korean and Chinese governments for the peaceful reunification of Korea, the efforts made by the Vietnamese government to unify Vietnam, and all other actions taken by peace-loving countries to defend world peace.

At the same time, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic wholeheartedly supports the efforts of the Asian and African peoples who are still under oppression to fight for their freedom, and strongly condemns the armed aggression and conspiracies carried out by imperialist countries against the Arab people, the Indonesian people, and other peoples.

The Hungarian people are clearly aware of how arduous the struggle is for the people of the world to defend their independence and maintain peace. In the autumn of 1956, the Hungarian people personally experienced this. After years of conspiracy, the US imperialist aggressive bloc took advantage of the difficulties arising in our country's construction and colluded with fascist elements, reactionaries, and revisionists hidden within our country in an attempt to restore the old system that the Hungarian people hated.

For several years, American leaders have repeatedly and publicly declared that they want to carry out so-called "liberation" of the liberated people. Of course, this means "liberating" them from their state of independence and freedom, from the socialist system without exploitation that they have chosen for themselves. By inciting mutual hatred between nations, with fascist demagoguery, and through armed attacks, they attempted to separate Hungary from the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and turn it back into an accomplice of warmongers. Therefore, in the autumn of 1956, they launched an attack against Hungary. However, the vast majority of the Hungarian people recognized how great a danger this posed to them, repelled the enemy's attack, and crushed the counter-revolutionary riot supported by imperialism.

Speaking of this struggle, we should emphasize the generous and selfless assistance given to the Hungarian people by the friendly Soviet people. The Soviet government provided this assistance at the request of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government in order to help the Hungarian people defend their independence, freedom, and socialism. We must also point out the moral, political, and material assistance given to us by the people of socialist countries, including the great Chinese people, in overcoming the difficulties caused by the counter-revolution. We also thank those countries that rejected the imperialist conspiracy when imperialism used the so-called Hungarian issue in the United Nations as political capital to intensify the Cold War.

The economic and cultural agreements signed between the Hungarian People's Republic and other friendly countries, as well as the contacts between leaders, demonstrate the development of relations between Hungary and these countries. We are very pleased that the relationship between Hungary and China has become closer in recent years. The visits to Hungary by Comrade Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council, and the visit to China by the Hungarian government delegation headed by Comrade Kádár last autumn have made great contributions to strengthening this relationship. Many facts prove that people's democratic Hungary is now more consolidated than before, and the wounds caused by the counter-revolution have been healed. The Hungarian people have always united around the government and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, enthusiastically carrying out socialist construction tasks. They are a reliable pillar of the socialist countries' unity, striving with all their strength to maintain peace, and maintaining national sovereignty and domestic socialist order with high vigilance. We are confident that we will most effectively and forcefully defend the noble cause of peace, friendship between nations, and peaceful coexistence.

Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai,

Esteemed guests,

Please allow me to thank you for attending our National Day banquet, and to propose a toast to the friendship between the Hungarian and Chinese peoples, to the unbreakable unity and greater achievements of the socialist camp, to the unity of peace-loving people of all countries, to peace, and to the good health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China.

### 诺格拉第大使的讲话

    诺格拉第大使的讲话亲爱的周恩来同志，尊敬的客人们：
    今天是匈牙利从德国法西斯主义压迫下解放出来的十三周年纪念日。光荣的苏联军队经过莫大的牺牲，粉碎了法西斯集团的武装力量，获得了具有世界历史意义的伟大胜利，匈牙利人民因此才获得了解放。所以全体匈牙利人民对于解放他们的伟大苏联人民，怀着衷心的感谢和爱戴。
    匈牙利人民是热爱自由的人民，他们在历史上不止一次证明了这一点。十三年来，我们看到匈牙利人民是能够利用他们的自由的；他们掌握了国家的领导权，把地主和教会的农庄分给了贫农和雇农。这就废除了封建主义的残余，解除了农村成千上万的人民的痛苦。由于银行和大工商业的国有化，对城市劳动人民的剥削被消灭了。由于进行了文化革命，文化就成了全体人民的财富。工业生产目前达到了战前水平的三倍半，大学生的人数增加了四倍。他们绝大部分是工人及劳动农民出身的。人民自己决定国家的外交政策，其目的是为了和其他社会主义国家及爱好和平的国家在一起，为避免新战争的爆发、为一切国家的和平共处而斗争。
    因此匈牙利人民把保卫和平的事业看为自己最神圣的任务，所以他们衷心支持苏联政府为了打退侵略集团所煽动起来的战争狂而采取的措施，包括为了禁止氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的使用、实现裁军，召开最高级会议和一切旨在保证不再发生世界大战而进行的努力。匈牙利人民共和国政府热烈支持波兰政府为了建立欧洲无原子武器地区而提出的建议、朝鲜和中国政府为了和平统一朝鲜而采取的措施、越南政府为了统一越南而作的努力，以及其他爱好和平的国家为了捍卫世界和平所采取的一切行动。
    同时，匈牙利人民共和国政府全心支持现在仍受着压迫的亚非人民为了争取自由的努力，严厉谴责帝国主义国家对阿拉伯人民和印度尼西亚人民以及其他人民所进行的武装侵略和阴谋活动。
    匈牙利人民清楚地知道，世界人民要保卫他们的独立、要维护和平，这是多么艰苦的斗争。在1956年秋天匈牙利人民亲身体验到这一点。美帝国主义侵略集团经过了几年的阴谋，利用我国在建设中所产生的困难，和暗藏在我国内部的法西斯分子、反动分子和修正主义者勾结起来，企图复辟匈牙利人民痛恨的旧制度。
    美国领导人几年来曾一再公开宣称他们要对解放了的人民进行所谓“解放”。当然是把他们从独立自由的状态中，从他们自己选择的没有剥削的社会主义制度下“解放”出来。他们用挑拨各民族间互相仇视和法西斯主义的骗人口号以及武装进攻，企图使匈牙利脱离以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，重新变为好战分子的帮凶。因此，1956年秋天他们发动了反对匈牙利的进攻。但是绝大多数的匈牙利人民认识到这对他们有多么大的危险，打退了敌人的进攻，粉碎了帝国主义所支持的反革命暴动。
    谈到这一斗争时，我们应该着重指出友好的苏联人民给予匈牙利人民的慷慨无私的援助。苏联政府为了帮助匈牙利人民捍卫他们的独立、自由和社会主义，应匈牙利工农革命政府的请求而给予这一援助的。我们还要指出包括伟大的中国人民在内的社会主义各国人民在道义上、政治上和物质上，为了克服反革命所造成的困难而给予我们的援助。当帝国主义在联合国利用所谓匈牙利问题作为政治资本来加剧冷战的时候，我们也感谢那些拒绝帝国主义阴谋的国家。
    匈牙利人民共和国和其他友好国家所签订的经济、文化协定以及领导人之间的接触，都表现着匈牙利同这些国家之间的关系的发展。匈牙利同中国的关系几年来更加密切了，这是我们很高兴的事。中华人民共和国副主席朱德同志，国务院总理周恩来同志到匈牙利访问，去年秋天以卡达尔同志为首的匈牙利政府代表团访问中国，对加强这种关系都有很大的贡献。有很多事实证明着人民民主的匈牙利现在比以前更加巩固了，反革命造成的创伤已经医治好了。匈牙利人民一直团结在政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党的周围，热烈地执行着社会主义建设任务，他们是社会主义国家团结的可靠的支柱，以全部力量为维护和平而努力，以高度的警惕性维护着国家主权和国内社会主义秩序。我们有信心最有效地、有力地捍卫和平、各国之间的友谊和和平共处的崇高事业。
    亲爱的周恩来同志，
    尊敬的客人们，
    请允许我感谢你们出席我们的国庆宴会，为了匈中两国人民的友谊，为了社会主义阵营牢不可破的团结和更大的成就，为了爱好和平的各国人民的团结，为了和平，为了中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志的身体健康干杯。
