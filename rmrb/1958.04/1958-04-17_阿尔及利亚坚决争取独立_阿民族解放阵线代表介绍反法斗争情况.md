Xinhua News Agency, April 16th, Kuala Lumpur Dispatch: Maadani, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front stationed in Cairo, said in Kuala Lumpur that the National Liberation Front would never stop fighting as long as Algeria did not achieve independence.

Maadani and Brahimi, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front stationed in Jakarta, held a press conference in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of the Federation of Malaya, on the 13th to introduce the Algerian people's struggle against French colonialism.

Maadani said that the armed struggle launched by the Algerian people against the French colonialists since November 1954 was launched by the National Liberation Front after peaceful negotiations with the French government failed. We demanded peace and independence, but the French colonialists responded with imprisonment and massacre. He said that to date, the French army has killed more than 600,000 innocent ordinary workers, farmers, and students in Algeria, and at least 80,000 people have been detained in concentration camps, which are as inhumane as those set up by German fascists during World War II.

He said that the new political system that France recently promised to implement is only limited autonomy, not complete independence. Under this political system, France still controls Algeria. Therefore, the Algerian people have expressed their firm rejection. He said that the Algerian people and the National Liberation Front will continue to fight until independence is achieved. He said that in the past, their armed forces had only 3,000 people, but now, with the support of the people, they have developed into a well-trained army of 100,000 people.

    阿尔及利亚坚决争取独立
    阿民族解放阵线代表介绍反法斗争情况
    新华社16日讯　吉隆坡消息：阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线驻开罗代表迈达尼在吉隆坡说，阿尔及利亚一天没有独立，民族解放阵线就决不停止斗争。
    迈达尼和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线驻雅加达代表布拉希米13日在马来亚联合邦首都吉隆坡举行记者招待会，介绍了阿尔及利亚人民反抗法国殖民主义者的斗争。
    迈达尼说，阿尔及利亚人民自1954年11月以来向法国殖民主义者展开的武装斗争，是民族解放阵线通过和平途径同法国政府谈判失败后才发动的。我们要求和平和获得独立，但是法国殖民主义者却用监禁和屠杀来答复我们。他说，到目前为止，法军已经在阿尔及利亚杀害了六十万以上无辜的普通工人、农民和学生，最少有八万人被拘禁在集中营里，这些集中营同第二次世界大战时期德国法西斯主义者所设立的同样惨无人道。
    他说，法国不久以前答应施行的新政制只不过是有限度的自治，而不是完全的独立自主。在这种政制下，法国仍然控制着阿尔及利亚。因此，阿尔及利亚人民已经表示坚决拒绝。他说，阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放阵线将继续斗争，直到实现独立为止。他说，过去他们的武装部队只有三千人，但是现在在人民的支持下，已经发展为一支拥有十万人的有良好训练的军队。
