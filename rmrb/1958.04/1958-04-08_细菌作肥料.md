    Bacteria as Fertilizer
    Hu Jisheng
    The soil teems with billions of microscopic organisms, the most numerous of which are bacteria. Bacterial activity influences soil fertility and the absorption of nutrients by crop roots. Selecting certain beneficial bacteria and cultivating them artificially to produce fertilizer is what we call bacterial fertilizer.
    One type of bacteria that has been relatively thoroughly studied is the rhizobium. Many experienced farmers know that the roots of leguminous crops develop small nodules called "bean eggs" or "water blisters," which serve as fertilizer. These nodules are home to countless rhizobium bacteria. Rhizobia help crops absorb nitrogenous nutrients from the air. Using scientific methods to select appropriate and superior strains of bacteria from the nodules of leguminous crop roots and cultivate them on a large scale produces a black, damp powder called rhizobium inoculant. Applying just three to five qian (approximately 15-25 grams) of rhizobium inoculant per mu (approximately 0.16 acres) to legume seeds can promote the rapid invasion of the crop roots by a large number of rhizobia, forming root nodules. After using rhizobium inoculant, seedlings are generally robust, leaves and stems are lush green, pods are full, root nodules are numerous, and roots are deeply anchored. Taking peanuts as an example, spending just two or three fen (very small amount) per mu on rhizobium inoculant for seed treatment can increase production by about thirty jin (approximately 15 kilograms) of peanuts. Currently, China is producing rhizobium inoculants for peanuts and soybeans on a large scale, and some regions are also promoting rhizobium inoculants for peas, broad beans, and other leguminous green manures.
    Another type of bacteria that has been widely demonstrated and promoted is azotobacter. Its function is similar to that of rhizobium, also absorbing nitrogenous nutrients from the air and secreting growth-promoting substances to help crop roots grow. These bacteria are widely distributed in farmland, and their scope of action is not limited to leguminous crops. They do not form root nodules to help crop roots absorb nutrients but rather are active outside the roots. Therefore, they are greatly affected by external environmental conditions, and their effect is not as significant as that of rhizobium. However, because of their wide range of applications and the relative simplicity of manufacturing and use, they are still a method of increasing crop yields.
    Selecting a good strain of azotobacter and processing it into a black powder is called azotobacter inoculant. When using this azotobacter inoculant as fertilizer, about half a jin to one jin (approximately 250-500 grams) is needed per mu. When applying this bacterial powder to the soil, favorable conditions should be provided, including organic matter (manure), moisture, phosphorus, and appropriate acidity (neutral), to allow the azotobacter to multiply in large numbers. After it comes into contact with the roots, it can exert its due effect.
    The soil in some areas of Northeast China is very fertile, with abundant organic matter, but the phosphorus in it is not easily absorbed by crop roots. Research has shown that certain special bacteria can interact with the phosphorus in soil organic matter, transforming it into a water-soluble state or a state that can be utilized by roots. Mass production and manufacturing of these bacteria have led to phosphate bacterial fertilizers.
    There are many other microorganisms in the soil that are beneficial to crop growth, but unfortunately, they have not been sufficiently explored. The application and effect of bacterial fertilizers are also limited by various conditions, and people cannot yet make good use of them. However, with the development of agricultural production and the progress of science, I firmly believe that bacterial fertilizers will increasingly and better serve our agricultural production.

    细菌作肥料
    胡济生
    土地里生活着亿万个肉眼看不见的微小生物，其中数量最多的就是细菌。细菌的活动影响着土地肥力和作物根系吸收肥分。把其中某些有益的细菌挑选出来，用人工方法培养繁殖制成肥料，这就是细菌肥料。
    现在研究得比较透彻的一种细菌是根瘤菌。很多老农都知道：豆类作物的根系上生有一些称为“豆蛋”、“水泡”的小疙瘩，起着粪肥的作用。这些小疙瘩里面生活着千千万万个细菌根瘤菌。根瘤菌能够帮助作物吸收空气中的氮素养料。用科学方法从豆类作物根系的小疙瘩——根瘤中挑选适当而优良的菌种来大量培养繁殖，制成一种黑色的潮粉剂，叫做根瘤菌剂。豆科作物每亩地只要用根瘤菌剂三、五钱拌种就可以促使大量的根瘤菌很快地侵入该作物根系形成根瘤。使用根瘤菌剂以后，一般秧子粗壮，叶茎浓绿，豆荚饱满，根瘤多，根系扎得深。拿花生来说，每亩地只要花两三分钱的代价，买上些根瘤菌剂来拌种，就可以增产约三十斤花生。目前我国已经在大量生产花生和大豆的根瘤菌剂，有些地区还在推广豌豆，蚕豆和其他豆科绿肥的根瘤菌剂。
    另一种已经大量示范推广的是固氮菌。它的作用和根瘤菌差不多，也是从空气中吸收氮素养料，并且分泌生长氨素物质来帮助作物的根系生长。这种细菌广泛分布在农田中，作用范围不限于豆科作物，也不是形成根瘤来帮助作物的根系吸收养分，而是在根外活动。因此它受外界环境条件的影响很大，它的效果不像根瘤菌那么显著。但是由于应用范围广，制造和使用也比较简便，所以还是提高农作物产量的一个方法。
    选用良好的固氮菌种，把它制成一种黑色的粉剂，就叫做固氮菌剂。用这种固氮菌剂作肥料，每亩地约需半斤至一斤。把这种菌粉应用到土壤中去的时候，应当提供些有利的条件——包括有机物质（圈粪）、水分、磷素、适当的酸度（中性）等，使固氮菌有大量繁殖的机会，当它与根系接触后，就可以发挥它应有的作用了。
    我国东北某些地区的土壤很肥沃，有机物质很丰富，但其中的磷素却不容易被作物的根系吸收利作。经过研究，已经知道可以利用某些特殊的细菌与土壤有机质中的磷素发生作用，变成水溶性的或者根系可以利用的状态。大量生产制造这种细菌，就成为磷细菌肥料。
    土壤中还有许多其他有益于作物生长的微小生物，可惜现在还发掘得很不够。细菌肥料的应用和效果也受种种条件的限制，人们还不能很好地利用。但是，随着农业生产的发展和科学的进步，我完全可以相信，细菌肥料将会愈来愈多地、更好地为我们的农业生产服务。
