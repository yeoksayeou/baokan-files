Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 29th: Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles have undergone an unprecedentedly profound political and ideological revolution in the rectification movement, taking a big step forward on the road of self-reform by destroying capitalism and establishing socialism.

The rectification movement in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles began gradually in late September of last year, with 180,000 people participating.

This rectification exposed that a few people in the bourgeoisie still adhere to a reactionary stance of hostility towards the Communist Party and the socialist cause. So far, more than 1,500 rightists have been exposed by industrialists and businessmen. These rightists have been engaging in anti-Communist and anti-socialist activities using various methods since the establishment of joint state-private ownership of all industries. Some even openly clamored to "kill Communists," "avenge" counter-revolutionaries who had been suppressed in the past, and "destroy socialism and establish capitalism." The reactionary words and deeds of the rightists aroused the public indignation of the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen. They engaged in thousands of persuasive struggles with the rightists, refuted the rightists, and also received a profound education and exercise, and began to distinguish between some major issues of right and wrong, draw a line between themselves and the rightists, and to varying degrees realized the serious danger of not changing their positions, and therefore universally demanded self-reform.

In the general rectification, the vast number of industrialists and businessmen set off a wave of self-exposure and mutual assistance. They publicly exposed the dirty things hidden deep in their hearts for the first time in front of others, in big-character posters or at large and small meetings. The dirty thoughts they handed over were of all kinds, from the early days of liberation to after the start of the rectification, including absurd views and erroneous thoughts on international situations, past political movements, the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, and the socialist system. After fierce ideological struggles, some people talked about their serious thoughts of changing the regime. Some handed over their hidden forged KMT ID cards, forged union director certificates, and forged store registration certificates and trademark patent certificates for many years. This self-exposure by industrialists and businessmen enabled them to realize the reactionary nature of the bourgeois stand and the corrupt nature of capitalist thought for the first time more clearly and specifically. In response to the thoughts they exposed, they also carried out analysis and criticism, examining its roots.

On the basis of such a big "destruction," Shanghai's industrialists and businessmen also made personal rectification plans, further establishing socialist ideology and promoting their transformation into self-reliant laborers. In their plans, they focused on the main problems in their politics and ideology, and set out goals and specific measures for self-reform in the future, generally including how to accept the leadership of the state representatives and fulfill their duties; learn from the working class, sincerely follow the socialist road, and participate in labor practice to change the bourgeois ideological style. Now, 26,000 key members and general industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai who have finished the centralized rectification study have returned to their original enterprises with plans. They generally handed over their plans to the party organizations and state representatives in the enterprises to solicit opinions, and some wrote them into big-character posters and posted them, asking employees to supervise them.

Industrialists and businessmen who have returned to enterprises after rectification are continuing to reform themselves in production practice. They have begun to have some new changes in accepting the leadership of state representatives and party organizations, learning from workers, and changing their lifestyles. Industrialists and businessmen with technical expertise have also cooperated with workers during this period and made some contributions to the trial production of new products and the solution of key production problems.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 29th: The heart-to-heart movement in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles has developed to a deeper stage. Most industrialists and businessmen, on the basis of consciousness and willingness, have begun to conduct self-analysis and criticism of the political and ideological errors they have handed over in order to improve their understanding.

Among the 36,000 industrialists and businessmen in the city who participated in the rectification, after revealing their thoughts and actions that were unfavorable to socialism in the heart-to-heart movement, many people felt that although the dirty things of capitalism had been poured out, it was not the end of the matter, but only the beginning of destroying capitalism. They asked to make self-examinations and criticisms. However, some people thought that it was all right after the heart-to-heart. In response to this situation, the rectification offices of the district federations of industry and commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association, with the help of the Party, corrected the wrong views of some people on the movement. Industrialists and businessmen in Chenxiang and Hongqiao districts adopted the methods of self-examination, free debate, and group assistance. Each industrialist and businessman summarized the erroneous thoughts and actions they revealed into several issues, and then found the main issues related to their political stance, and conducted self-examination, free discussion, and mutual inspiration in group meetings. The scope of the group is generally about ten people. Some are freely combined according to personal willingness, or find people who are familiar with each other to talk to each other; some talk about their feelings and thoughts in twos and threes, without sticking to formalities. Many district federations of industry and commerce and rectification offices of the Democratic National Construction Association also held "experience exchange meetings on self-examination and self-understanding," and took the lead in focusing on criticizing their three hearts and two minds about the party's leadership and taking the socialist road, and their dissatisfaction with learning from the working class, from the industrial and commercial key members who did a better job in self-examination and criticism and other different types of industrialists and businessmen, to inspire the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to consciously examine themselves. At present, more than 1,400 industrial and commercial key members in the city have initially conducted self-examination and criticism in group meetings; more than 30,000 general industrialists and businessmen have also found the main aspects that they should criticize, and have begun to actively examine and help each other in group meetings.

In their self-examination and criticism, Tianjin's industrialists and businessmen, like in the heart-to-heart, conducted ideological struggles: whether to criticize or not; whether to criticize deeply or superficially. But when they checked and criticized, they were welcomed by other industrialists and businessmen, and they also gave opinions and helped them in the places they did not check. Many people felt that if they spoke their hearts, only by boldly conducting self-examination can they truly improve their understanding; some people felt more comfortable after self-examination and criticism, and actively played a role in their work.

On the basis of self-examination, criticism and mutual assistance, the heart-to-heart movement in Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles will organize large-scale and joint group debates on major issues of right and wrong that cannot be resolved at group meetings and are of a general nature, in order to further improve understanding.

### 真心诚意走社会主义道路  上海工商界在实践中继续自我改造  天津工商界深入批判错误思想

    真心诚意走社会主义道路
    上海工商界在实践中继续自我改造
    天津工商界深入批判错误思想
    据新华社上海29日电　上海工商界在整风运动中经历了一场空前深刻的政治上和思想上的革命，在破资本主义、立社会主义的自我改造道路上跨进了一大步。
    上海工商界的整风是从去年9月下旬陆续开始的，有十八万人参加了这次整风。
    这次整风暴露出资产阶级中少数人仍坚持着敌视共产党和社会主义事业的反动立场。到目前为止，经过工商业者揭发出的右派分子已有一千五百多个。这些右派分子从全行业公私合营以后，就用各种手法进行反共反社会主义的活动，有的人甚至公开叫嚣“要杀共产党人”，为过去被镇压的反革命分子“报仇”，要“破社（会主义）立资
  （本主义）”。右派分子的反动言行，激起了广大工商业者的公愤。他们同右派分子进行了千百次的说理斗争，驳倒了右派，自己也受到了一次深刻的教育和锻炼，开始分清了一些大是大非的问题，划清了与右派分子的界限，在不同程度上认识到自己不改变立场的严重危险，因而普遍地要求进行自我改造。
    在一般整风中，广大工商业者掀起了一个自我暴露、相互帮助的热潮。他们在大字报或者在大小会议上，把自己隐藏在心底深处的脏东西第一次公开在别人面前。他们交出的肮脏思想形形色色，远至解放初期，近至整风开始以后，包括对国际形势、历次政治运动、共产党和工人阶级领导、社会主义制度等各方面的荒谬观点和错误思想。经过剧烈的思想斗争，有的人谈出了自己曾经有严重的变天思想。有的交出自己隐藏多年的伪国民身份证、伪公会理事证、伪商店注册证和商标专利证。工商业者的这种自我暴露，使他们自己第一次比较清晰而具体地认识到资产阶级立场的反动性和资本主义思想的腐朽本质。针对自己暴露出来的思想，他们又进行了分析批判，检查它的根源。
    在这样大“破”的基础上，上海工商业者又人人制订个人整改规划，进一步树立社会主义思想，推动自己改造成为自食其力的劳动者。他们在规划中针对自己政治、思想上的主要问题，订出今后自我改造的努力目标和具体措施，一般包括如何接受公方代表领导，做到守职尽责；向工人阶级学习，真心诚意走社会主义道路和参加劳动实践，改变资产阶级思想作风等几个方面。现在，上海工商界中已经结束集中整风学习的二万六千名骨干分子和一般工商业者已带着规划回到原来的企业。他们普遍把自己的规划交给企业中的党组织和公方代表征求意见，有些人并写成大字报张贴出来，要求职工监督。
    经过整风回到企业的工商业者，正在生产实践中继续进行自我改造。他们在接受公方代表和党组织领导，向工人学习以及改变生活方式等方面，开始有了一些新的变化。有技术专长的工商业者，这一时期也和工人合作，在试制新产品和解决生产关键问题上，作出了一些贡献。
    据新华社天津29日电　天津市工商界的交心运动已发展到更深入的阶段，大部分工商业者在自觉自愿的基础上，开始对自己交出来的政治上、思想上的错误，进行自我分析批判，以提高认识。
    全市参加整风的三万六千多名工商业者，在交心运动中揭发了自己不利于社会主义的思想言行以后，许多人感到，虽然把资本主义的肮脏东西倒出来了，但不等于完事，而只是破资本主义的开始，纷纷要求作自我检查和批判。但是也有部分人认为交心以后就完事大吉。针对这种情况，各区工商联和民建会整风办公室在党的帮助下，纠正了部分人对运动的错误看法。城厢和红桥等区的工商业者采取自我检查、自由争论、小组帮助的方式，由每个工商业者，把自己所揭露出的错误思想言行，归纳成若干问题，然后找出有关政治立场上的主要问题，在小组会上进行自我检查、自由漫谈、互相启发。小组的范围一般是十人左右，有的根据个人自愿自由结合，或找彼此熟悉情况的人互相交谈；有的三三两两、不拘形式地谈心、谈感想。不少区工商联和民建会整风办公室还召开了“自我检查、自我认识经验交流会”，从自我检查批判较好的工商界骨干分子和其他不同类型的工商业者，带头集中批判自己对党的领导和走社会主义道路三心二意、向工人阶级学习不服气等错误看法，启发广大工商业者自觉检查自己。目前，全市一千四百多名工商界骨干分子，已在小组会上初步作了自我检查批判；三万多名一般工商业者也找到了自己应该批判的主要方面，开始在小组会上主动检查，相互帮助。
    天津市工商业者在自我检查批判中，和交心一样进行了思想斗争：是批判、还是不批判；是批判的深、还是肤浅的批判一下。但是当他们检查批判以后，受到其他工商业者的欢迎，对他们没检查到的地方，还提出意见进行帮助，很多人感到交了心，只有大胆的进行自我检查，才能真正的提高认识；有些人在自我检查批判后，心情更加舒畅，积极在工作上发挥作用。
    天津市工商界交心运动，将在自我检查批判、互相帮助的基础上，对小组会上解决不了而且带有普遍性的大是大非问题，组织大会、联组辩论，进一步提高认识。
