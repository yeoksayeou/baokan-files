    Drug Packaging Should Be Improved
    I work in pharmacy. I have found a lot of waste in the packaging of medicines during the purchase and use of drugs. For example, some chemical reagents are used in small quantities in hospitals and laboratories, only a few grams or tens of milligrams each time. When purchasing from Hangzhou or Shanghai pharmaceutical companies, many are large packages, some weighing one jin (500g), some weighing one pound. After buying them, some take two or three years to use up, and some take decades. Because some reagents are more expensive, buying one jin or one pound costs tens of yuan, or even more than a hundred yuan. After buying them, they cannot be used up for a long time, resulting in a backlog of funds and causing waste. Therefore, we request that chemical reagent manufacturers produce more small-packaged reagents in the future as appropriate. (Zhu Renchang, First Hospital of Jinhua, Zhejiang)

    药品包装应当改进
    我是做药剂工作的。我在购买和使用药品中，发现在包装方面有不少浪费。如某些化学试剂，医院和检验室用的都较少，每次只用几克，或几十毫克。当向杭州或上海医药公司购买时，许多是大包装，有的一斤，有的一磅。买回来后，有的要用两三年，有的可用几十年。因为有些试剂较贵重，买一斤或一磅要几十元，甚至百余元。买来之后，长时期用不完，积压资金，造成浪费。因此，我们要求，化学试剂制造厂今后能酌情多出产一些小包装试药。　（浙江金华第一医院朱仁昶）
