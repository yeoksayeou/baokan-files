The compatriot Liu Lianren, who was abducted by Japanese fascists, has finally returned to his beloved motherland after suffering fourteen years of hardship in Japan. As soon as Liu Lianren set foot on the soil of the motherland, he was warmly received by representatives from all walks of life and his relatives. The two welcome rallies held by all sectors of Tanggu and Tianjin expressed the infinite care of the broad masses of the people of the motherland for compatriot Liu Lianren, and at the same time showed the Chinese people's incomparable indignation at the Japanese militarists' crimes of aggression and the irresponsible attitude of the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government in the Liu Lianren incident!

At the welcome rallies, representatives from all sectors of Tanggu and Tianjin unanimously expressed their firm support for Liu Lianren's demand that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government compensate for all losses, and believed that the Kishi Nobusuke government must provide a responsible explanation of the Liu Lianren incident as soon as possible. This is completely justified and reasonable. The Chinese people and Liu Lianren himself have every right to demand that the Japanese government compensate Liu Lianren and his family for the spiritual and material losses suffered during these fourteen years. When Liu Lianren was in Japan, he repeatedly raised the issue of compensation from the Japanese government, but the Japanese government has always adopted an irresponsible attitude; it even tried to deceive Liu Lianren with "consolation money" so that he would no longer raise this legitimate demand, but this has been severely rejected by Liu Lianren.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's despicable means and irresponsible attitude on the Liu Lianren issue are intolerable. It must provide an explanation of this incident as soon as possible. After Liu Lianren was discovered in February of this year, the Japanese government authorities have been evading the responsibility it should bear, falsely accusing Liu Lianren of so-called "illegal entry" in an attempt to inflict new persecution; later, the Japanese government's Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi repeatedly denied the fact that Liu Lianren was illegally abducted; the Director-General of the Asian Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Itagaki Osamu, even publicly stated that Liu Lianren was working as a laborer in Hokkaido under a "contract"; and some Japanese officials even defended the Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude, saying that the Kishi Nobusuke government cannot be held responsible for the war of aggression against China by the Japanese militarists, so it can only treat the Liu Lianren incident indifferently. Obviously, all these defenses by the Japanese government authorities are untenable; on the contrary, they once again expose the imperialist stance of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

We have fresh memories of the disasters brought to the Chinese people by the Japanese militarists. The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government describes the atrocities of the Japanese army using bayonets to abduct peaceful Chinese residents as executing some kind of "contract." This is not only an absurd statement, but also a great insult to the dignity of the Chinese people! Who doesn't know that during the war of aggression against China, the Japanese militarists caused the massacre of millions of Chinese people and incalculable losses of public and private property, and abducted tens of thousands of Chinese people to Japan to enslave and kill them. Liu Lianren is just one of the thousands upon thousands of abducted Chinese people. The Liu Lianren incident gives us more reason to suspect whether there are still a second, a third, or even more Liu Lianrens in Japan who are still suffering inhuman torture. Our government has repeatedly demanded that the Japanese government provide a responsible and concrete explanation of the situation of the Chinese people who were abducted to Japan during the war of aggression against China. The Japanese government's attempt to evade this responsibility is simply impossible; it is even more intolerable for us to continue to treat the Chinese people with the imperialist attitude of the past.

The Kishi Nobusuke government should understand that the Chinese people have the right to demand compensation from the Japanese government for the huge losses they have suffered; and have the right to demand a responsible explanation from the Japanese government for all the abducted Chinese people. The Kishi Nobusuke government, as the legitimate government of Japan today, bears an unshirkable responsibility for all the problems left over after the defeat of the Japanese militarists in the war of aggression against China. Since the Kishi Nobusuke government can be responsible for handling Japan's war reparations to the Philippines, Indonesia, and other countries, what reason can it have to say that it is not responsible for the war of aggression against China? Since the Kishi Nobusuke government can posthumously award and commend Takeshi Rokuzo, the former chief of general affairs of the puppet state of Manchuria, who died as a war criminal who invaded China, and describe his crimes of aggression against China as merits to Japan, then what reason does it have not to provide a responsible explanation for the Chinese people who were abducted by the Japanese invading army? Just take the issue of a large number of Chinese people being abducted to Japan, the Kishi Nobusuke government bears direct responsibility. The Japanese fascist army's large-scale abduction of peaceful Chinese residents during the war of aggression against China was carried out in accordance with the "Policy on Transferring Chinese Laborers" decided by the Japanese Cabinet meeting on November 27, 1942; and the current Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke was a member of the Tojo Cabinet at that time, and was one of the responsible persons who participated in the formulation of this policy that violated international regulations and enslaved the Chinese people. From these facts, it can be seen that it is completely unreasonable for the Kishi Nobusuke government not to provide a responsible explanation for the Liu Lianren incident and the Chinese people who were abducted to Japan during the war of aggression against China, and it is a manifestation of deliberate hostility towards the Chinese people.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people is inseparable from its pursuit of American war policies and its latent imperialist stance. In recent years, the Kishi Nobusuke government, on the one hand, has allowed American imperialism to permanently occupy Okinawa Island and establish atomic weapons bases in Japan, making Japan completely a base for the United States to provoke wars of aggression in the Far East; on the other hand, it is actively preparing to revise the constitution and striving to expand Japan's military power in order to revive the forces of Japanese militarism. At the same time, it is making every effort to expand economically and politically in Southeast Asia, dreaming of using American funds to rebuild the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" under new pretenses. Its continued adoption of an imperialist and hostile attitude towards the Chinese people is an attempt to use the aggressive forces of the United States to subdue the Chinese people so that it can freely revive militarism. If the people of Asian countries lose their due vigilance against the latent imperialist ambitions of the Kishi Nobusuke government, it will be very dangerous for peace in the Far East.

The Chinese people have friendly feelings towards the Japanese people. This was the case in the past and is the case now, and it will not change in the future. But we can never tolerate the Japanese government continuing to be hostile to the Chinese people and not providing a responsible explanation for the Liu Lianren incident and the Chinese people who were abducted to Japan during the war of aggression against China. On the Liu Lianren incident, we are pleased to see that the attitude of the Japanese people is very different from that of the Japanese government. The reason why Liu Lianren was able to return to China this time was due to the pressure of the Chinese people's stern protests and the Japanese people's just public opinion. We express our deep gratitude to the Japanese people, Japanese civil organizations, and progressive political parties for their friendly attitude of helping and supporting Liu Lianren's return to China!

### 日本政府应对刘连仁事件作出负责交代

    日本政府应对刘连仁事件作出负责交代
    被日本法西斯掳去的难胞刘连仁，在日本受尽了十四年的苦难之后，现在终于回到自己亲爱的祖国来了。刘连仁刚一踏上祖国的土地，就受到祖国各界代表和他的亲人们的热情接待。塘沽各界和天津各界所举行的两次欢迎大会，更表达了祖国广大人民对难胞刘连仁的无限关怀，同时显示了中国人民对于日本军国主义者的侵略罪行和日本岸信介政府在刘连仁事件中采取不负责任的态度的无比愤慨！
    在欢迎大会上，塘沽和天津各界代表在他们的讲话中，一致表示坚决支持刘连仁向日本岸信介政府提出赔偿一切损失的要求，并认为岸信介政府必须尽快地对刘连仁事件作出负责的交代。这是完全正当和合理的。中国人民和刘连仁本人完全有权要求日本政府赔偿刘连仁和他的家属在这十四年间所受到的精神上和物质上的损失。刘连仁在日本的时候，曾经一再提出要日本政府赔偿的问题，可是日本政府一直采取不负责任的态度；甚至用送“慰问金”的手段，企图蒙蔽刘连仁，使他不再提出这个正当要求，但是已遭到刘连仁的严峻拒绝。
    岸信介政府在刘连仁问题上所采取这种卑劣手段和不负责的态度，是使人难于容忍的。它必须对这事件尽快地作出交代。今年2月间刘连仁被发现以后，日本政府当局一直回避它所应负的责任，诬称刘连仁有所谓“非法入境”嫌疑，企图加以新的迫害；以后，日本政府内阁官房长官爱知揆一又一再抵赖非法掳去刘连仁的事实；日本外务省亚洲局局长板垣修并且公开声称，刘连仁是根据“合同”在北海道作劳工的；而有的日本官员甚至为岸信介政府这种态度进行辩解，说什么日本军国主义者侵略中国的战争，岸信介政府不能负责，因此它对刘连仁事件只能冷淡置之。很显然，日本政府当局的这种种辩解，都是根本站不住脚的，相反地却再一次暴露了岸信介政府的帝国主义的立场。
    日本军国主义者带给中国人民的灾难，我们记忆犹新。日本岸信介政府把日本军队用刺刀劫走中国和平居民的暴行，说成是执行什么“合同”，这不仅是荒谬绝伦的说法，并且是对中国人民的尊严的极大侮辱！谁不知道，日本军国主义者在侵略中国的战争期间，曾经使千万以上的中国人民遭受屠杀，公私财产遭受难以数计的损失，曾经把成千成万的中国人掳到日本去加以奴役和杀害。刘连仁只是千千万万被掳走的中国人中间的一个。从刘连仁事件，使我们更有理由怀疑在日本是否还有第二个、第三个甚至更多的刘连仁仍然在遭受着惨无人道的折磨。我国政府曾经一再要求日本政府对侵略中国战争期间被掳到日本去的中国人的情况，负责地作出具体交代。日本政府想逃避这个责任，是根本不行的；想继续用过去的帝国主义态度对待中国人民，更是我们所绝对难于容忍的。
    岸信介政府应该了解：中国人民对于他们遭受的巨大损失，有权要求日本政府予以赔偿；对于被掳走的一切中国人，有权要日本政府作出负责的交代。岸信介政府作为今天日本的合法政府，对于日本军国主义者在侵略中国战争失败后所遗留下来的一切问题，都负有不可推卸的责任。岸信介政府既然能负责处理日本对菲律宾、印度尼西亚等国的战争赔偿问题，有什么理由能说它对侵略中国的战争不负责任呢？岸信介政府既然能对已经死去的侵略中国战争罪犯、前伪满洲国政府总务长官武部六藏叙勋授赏，把他侵略中国的罪行说成是对日本的功绩，那末有什么理由不对被日本侵略军队掳走的中国人作出负责的交代呢？就以大批中国人被劫掳到日本去这个问题来说吧，岸信介政府就负有直接的责任。日本法西斯军队在侵略中国战争中大规模劫掳中国和平居民，是根据1942年11月27日日本内阁会议决定的“移入华工方针”进行的；而现任首相的岸信介，就是当时东条内阁的阁员，是参与制订这一违反国际法规、奴役中国人民的政策的负责人之一。从这些事实中可以看到，岸信介政府对刘连仁事件和侵略中国战争期间被掳到日本去的中国人不作负责交代，是根本没有道理的，是蓄意敌视中国人民的表现。
    岸信介政府敌视中国人民的态度，是同它追随美国战争政策和潜在的帝国主义立场分不开的。近年来，岸信介政府一方面听任美帝国主义永久霸占冲绳岛，在日本建立原子武器基地，使日本完全变成美国在远东挑起侵略战争的策源地；一方面积极准备修改宪法，力图扩大日本的军事力量，以复活日本军国主义势力。同时，它在经济上和政治上正尽力对东南亚地区扩张，梦想借助于美国的资金在新招牌下重建所谓“大东亚共荣圈”。它对中国人民继续采取帝国主义的敌对态度，就是企图借美国的侵略势力压服中国人民，以便它放手复活军国主义。亚洲国家人民对岸信介政府这种潜在的帝国主义企图，如果丧失应有的警惕，那对于远东和平是非常危险的。
    中国人民对于日本人民是有着友好感情的。过去和现在如此，将来也不会改变。可是我们决不能容忍日本政府继续敌视中国人民，对刘连仁事件和侵华战争期间被掳到日本去的中国人不作负责交代。在刘连仁事件上，我们高兴地看到，日本人民的态度同日本政府的态度是截然不同的。这次刘连仁所以能够回国，是在中国人民严正抗议和日本人民公正舆论的压力下实现的。我们对日本人民、日本民间团体和进步党派援助和支持刘连仁回国的友好态度，表示深深地感谢！
