Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th: TASS, Moscow, 27th. “Pravda” published a lengthy editorial summarizing some of the scientific explorations carried out by the Soviet Union's first two artificial Earth satellites.

	“Pravda” recalled that the first artificial satellite was launched on October 4, 1957, weighing 83.6 kilograms. The second artificial satellite was launched on November 3, 1957, weighing 508.3 kilograms. The first Soviet artificial satellite, upon entering orbit, had a perigee (the point in orbit closest to Earth) of 228 kilometers and an apogee (the point in orbit furthest from Earth) of 947 kilometers. The perigee and apogee of the second artificial satellite were 225 kilometers and 1,671 kilometers, respectively. The initial orbital period of the first satellite was 96.17 minutes, while the second satellite's was 103.75 minutes. During its existence from October 4, 1957, to January 4, 1958, the first satellite completed approximately 1,400 orbits around the Earth. The second satellite completed approximately 2,370 orbits from November 3, 1957, to April 14, 1958.

	The article pointed out that, thanks to the first two Soviet artificial satellites, the planned scientific exploration program has been successfully implemented. Overall, the accumulated material is extremely extensive, and the research on these materials is still ongoing.

	The article emphasized that analyzing the changes in satellite orbits at different times allows for the determination of the density of the upper atmosphere. Therefore, studying satellite trajectories is of great significance. Satellite orbital elements can be determined based on observations using radio engineering and optical methods.

	"Pravda" wrote that the radio engineering methods used in receiving satellite radio signals include radio direction finding and Doppler effect observations. The simplest optical observation of a satellite involves recording the time when the satellite passes the observation point. For more precise coordinate determination, specially designed cine-theodolites were used, and modern aerial cameras were employed to obtain photographs of satellite tracks.

	The "Pravda" editorial went on to state that, due to the accurate observations (accurate enough to reliably determine atmospheric density) conducted on the first two Soviet satellites, all orbital data was determined immediately after the satellites were launched, and the changes in the period of each orbit of the satellites were measured throughout their entire existence.

	Based on the obtained materials, it can be concluded that the atmospheric temperature at an altitude of 225 kilometers above the ground is higher than previously theorized. "Pravda" wrote that the discovery of this high atmospheric temperature raises the question for geophysicists about the source of energy required for such intense heating of the atmosphere. The known "hard" ultraviolet and X-rays from the sun may not be sufficient to heat it to this extent. At present, only various hypotheses can be proposed in this regard. For example, it can be assumed that the strong heating of the upper atmosphere in the polar regions is due to the effect of solar particle radiation. The increased heat throughout the upper atmosphere may be due to the effect of ultrasonic waves generated in the troposphere or due to electric currents generated in the conductive ionized air, which is due to the movement of ionized air in the Earth's magnetic field. The article pointed out that further research on the upper atmosphere using rockets and artificial Earth satellites can provide the final answer to all these interesting and important questions.

	"Pravda" continued by writing that the study of the radio signals from the first two artificial Earth satellites has provided us with new data on the outer layer of the ionosphere, that is, the portion of the ionosphere located at altitudes above 300-400 kilometers. The ionosphere is the upper layer of the atmosphere, containing a large number of free charged particles (electrons and ions). The newspaper pointed out that the data obtained from the study of the radio signals from the first two artificial Earth satellites indicate that the extent to which the electron concentration (the content of free electrons per cubic centimeter) decreases with altitude in the outer ionosphere (located above the region of maximum electron concentration) is one-fifth to one-sixth of the extent to which it increases with altitude below the region of maximum electron concentration. For example, during the observation period (October), the electron concentration increased almost tenfold from an altitude of 100 kilometers to an altitude of 300 kilometers, while it decreased by one-half from an altitude of 300 kilometers to an altitude of 500 kilometers.

	Two instruments for recording the number of cosmic ray particles were installed on the second artificial satellite to study this radiation. The article stated that the satellite passed over places at different distances from the Earth's surface as it orbited the Earth. Therefore, based on the satellite's measurements of cosmic rays, the relationship between the number of particles and altitude was found. The results of studying the obtained data show that the cosmic ray intensity increased by about 40% from the lowest point of the orbit, 225 kilometers, to an altitude of 700 kilometers. "Pravda" wrote that studying cosmic rays using instruments on the satellite can also reveal the relationship between cosmic ray intensity and latitude and longitude. This can provide new data on the Earth's magnetic field.

	Speaking about the biological experiments conducted through the second artificial Earth satellite carrying the experimental animal, the dog "Laika," the newspaper said that the animal was positioned in such a way that the direction of acceleration when the satellite entered orbit was from chest to back. In this case, the sudden increase in weight pressed the animal against the floor of the sealed cabin. "Pravda" pointed out that choosing such a position for the animal was because it is one of the most favorable positions for the body. During the journey to orbit, in addition to acceleration, the noise and vibration of the rocket's engine also affected the animal. After analyzing the obtained data and comparing it with the results of previous laboratory experiments, it can be affirmed that the animal was in very good condition during the period from launch to entering orbit. "Pravda" wrote that the initial estimates of the obtained data very clearly indicate that animals can withstand the conditions of space flight very well. The positive results of the experiments in this area allow us to continue and expand the research aimed at ensuring the health and safety of humans in space flight more persistently.

	The newspaper concluded by writing that, due to the successful launch of artificial Earth satellites, scientists have for the first time obtained a tool to directly investigate the upper atmosphere and outer space. Future satellite launches during the International Geophysical Year will be able to expand the most important scientific research projects conducted in outer space.

	"Pravda" pointed out that the preliminary results listed in the article will soon be published in the form of scientific papers in various journals.

    头两个红月亮科学考察的成果
    “真理报”编辑部文章作出若干总结
    指出继续发射的卫星将扩大研究项目
    新华社28日讯　塔斯社莫斯科27日讯：“真理报”发表了长篇编辑部文章，对苏联头两个人造地球卫星的科学考察作了若干总结。
      “真理报”回顾说，第一个人造卫星是1957年10月4日发射的，重量是八三点六公斤。第二个人造卫星是1957年11月3日发射的，重量是五○八点三公斤。第一个苏联人造卫星在刚进入轨道时近地点（轨道上离地球最近的一点）的高度是二百二十八公里，远地点（轨道上离地球最远的一点）的高度是九百四十七公里。第二个人造卫星近地点和远地点的高度分别是二百二十五公里和一千六百七十一公里。第一个卫星在运行初期绕地球一圈的时间是九六点一七分钟，第二个卫星是一○三点七五分钟。第一个卫星在从1957年10月4日到1958年1月4日的存在期间，共围绕地球运行了约一千四百圈。第二个卫星从1957年11月3日到1958年4月14日运行了约二千三百七十圈。
    文章指出，依靠头两个苏联人造卫星，已经胜利地实现了预定的科学考察计划。整个说来，积累的材料是极其广泛的，对这些材料的研究还在继续进行中。
    文章指出，分析卫星轨道在不同时间发生的变化，就可以测定大气高层的密度，所以研究卫星运行情况具有巨大的意义。卫星轨道要素可以根据无线电工学和光学方法进行的观测来确定。
      “真理报”写道，在接收卫星无线电讯号时所采用的无线电工学方法中有无线电测向和都普勒效应观测。对卫星的最简单的光学观察，就是记录卫星经过观察地点的时刻。为了更精确地测定座标，采用了特制的电影摄影经纬仪，为了获得卫星行迹的照片，使用了现代化的空中摄影机。
    “真理报”编辑部文章接着指出，由于对苏联的头两个卫星进行了准确（准确的程度足以可靠地确定大气密度）的观测，在卫星刚刚发射后就测定了轨道的所有数据，测定了在卫星存在的整个期间卫星每一圈运行周期的变化。
    根据获得的材料，可以得出结论：在离地面二百二十五公里的高空中，大气温度比以前理论推想的要高。“真理报”写道，这种大气高温的发现向地球物理学家提出了大气强烈变热所需的能的来源的问题。大家所知道的太阳的“硬”紫外线和X射线未必足以使它热到这种程度。现在只能对这方面提出各种假设。例如，可以设想，两极地区大气高层强烈变热，是由于太阳的微粒辐射的作用。整个大气高层的热度增高，可能是由于对流层所发生的超声波的作用，或者是由于在导电的电离空气中产生的电流的作用，这种电流是由于电离的空气在地球磁场中运动产生的。文章指出，用火箭和人造地球卫星进一步研究大气高层，就可以获得对这一切有趣味的重要问题的最后答案。
    “真理报”接着写道，对于头两个人造地球卫星无线电讯号的研究，使我们获得了有关电离层外层、也就是电离层中高度在三百—四百公里以上的部分的新资料。电离层是大气层的高层，它包含大量自由的带电粒子（电子和离子）。报纸指出，由于对头两个人造地球卫星无线电讯号的研究而获得的资料表明，电子浓度（每一立方公分的自由电子含量）在外电离层（位于主要的电子浓度最大的区域的上面）内随高度而降低的程度，为它在电子浓度最大的区域以下随高度而增加的程度的五分之一到六分之一。例如，在观察时期（10月份），从一百公里的高度到三百公里的高度，电子浓度增加到将近十倍，而从三百公里的高度到五百公里的高度则降低到二分之一。
    在第二个人造卫星上装置了两个记录宇宙线粒子数量的仪器来研究这种射线。文章说，卫星在围绕地球运行时飞过的地方离地球表面的距离是不同的。因此根据卫星对宇宙线的测量，找出了粒子数量同高度的关系。对所得资料进行研究的结果表明，从轨道的最低点二百二十五公里的高度到七百公里的高度，宇宙线强度增加了约40％。“真理报”写道，通过卫星上的仪器研究宇宙线，还可以得出宇宙线强度同经纬度之间的关系。这样就能获得有关地球磁场的新资料。
    谈到通过装有试验动物小狗“莱伊卡”的第二个人造地球卫星所进行的生物学试验时，报纸说，卫星上的动物被安排成这样的位置，即当卫星飞入轨道时加速度的作用方向是从胸到背。在这种情况下，体重突增就把动物压在密封舱的地板上。“真理报”指出，给动物选择这样的位置，是因为它是对机体最有利的位置之一。在飞向轨道的一段路程中，除了加速度以外，火箭的发动机运转的噪音和振动也对动物有影响。分析所得的资料并把这些资料同以前试验室试验的结果加以比较后，可以肯定，动物在从起飞到进入轨道的期间内情况十分良好。“真理报”写道，对于所得资料的初步估计十分清楚地表明，动物可以很好地经受住宇宙飞行的条件。在这方面实验的肯定结果使我们可以更加坚持不懈地继续和扩大旨在保证宇宙飞行中人的健康和生命安全的研究。
    报纸最后写道，由于人造地球卫星发射成功，科学家们第一次获得了直接考察大气高层和宇宙空间的工具。在国际地球物理年期间今后继续发射的卫星将能够扩大在宇宙空间进行的最重要的科学研究项目。
    “真理报”指出，文章中所列举的初步结果最近即将以科学论文的形式在各种杂志上发表。
