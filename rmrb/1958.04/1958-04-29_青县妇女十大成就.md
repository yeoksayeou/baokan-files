Ten Great Achievements of Qingxian Women

In the great leap forward in production, in addition to actively participating in various production labors together with male commune members, the women of Qingxian, Hebei, also launched the "One Fresh Thing" movement for women (meaning that women make an outstanding contribution in production). In less than three months, ten fresh things that shocked the whole county emerged. These things are: First, 120 women from the original Zhaoxuan Township built a cement-brick "March 8th Sluice Gate" in one and a half months, which can irrigate 45,000 mu of land, accounting for 84% of the total cultivated land area of the township, and prevent more than 100 villages upstream from suffering from waterlogging. Second, Yang Xiulan and other ten sisters from Huangzhuang led the women of the township to invest 5,700 yuan to purchase a ten-horsepower Women's Coal Machine, which is used for irrigating land, as well as for rice milling and grinding, to supply the entire village. Third, more than 1,000 women from nineteen villages including Qingshui Bai deepened the original three-and-a-half-foot-deep reservoir by one and a half feet, building a large reservoir with an area of 540 mu, greatly increasing the water storage capacity and being able to irrigate 2,500 mu of land. Fourth, the women of five villages including Beiguanting invested 5,760 yuan to buy 210 piglets and build five "March 8th" pig farms; Fifth, the women of four villages including Wangweitun accumulated funds and labor to build four "Sisters' Bridges" and "March 8th Bridges." Sixth, 2,107 women in Mendian Township invested 3,350 yuan to buy 48 waterwheels, which can irrigate 1,325 mu of land. Seventh, 61 women from the Zaoyuan Cooperative of the Hui Autonomous Township invested 540 yuan to build a flock of 74 sheep. Eighth, 120 women from the Daxingkou Cooperative invested 570 yuan to expand a "March 8th" grass bag factory, turning a small factory with two straw rope machines, three grass bag machines, and six women into a grass bag factory with six straw rope machines, eight grass bag machines, and twenty-seven women, and increased work efficiency threefold. Ninth, women in Daduzhuang and nearby villages built three "March 8th Roads." There are "March 8th Bridges" on the "March 8th Roads," "March 8th Channels" under the "March 8th Bridges," "March 8th Pig Farms" built at the beginning of the "March 8th Roads," and "March 8th Forests" planted along the "March 8th Roads." Tenth, 45 women in Xu Lizhuang built a hundred-mu women's vegetable garden, which can solve the funding for 1,500 mu of rice fields in the entire cooperative and provide vegetables for all cooperative members.
