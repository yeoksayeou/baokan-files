    Riverside of the Qinhuai River

    Transportation tools are all dispatched, delivering fertilizer to the countryside like a race,
    Supporting the great leap forward in agriculture, realizing the Forty Articles ahead of schedule.
    Female comrades, not simple.
    Boosting morale to carry burdens,
    Their spirit does not diminish compared to men.
    "You are young,
    I am afraid you won't be able to carry much?"
    "I will be going to the countryside soon,
    I'll practice my strength first."
    Those who are too old to carry,
    Send tea and water to comfort them.
    If there are not enough tools, there is a solution,
    Basins and iron buckets are put to use.
    You pass it to me,
    I hand it to her;
    One person carries a bucket,
    Many people, great strength.

    秦淮河畔

    运输工具齐出动，送肥下乡如赛跑，
    支援农业大跃进，提前实现四十条。
    女同志，不简单。
    鼓起干劲来挑担，
    气概不减男子汉。
    “你的年纪轻，
    挑多怕不行？”
    “不久要下乡，
    先来练练劲。”
    年纪太大不能挑，
    送茶送水来慰劳。
    工具不够有办法，
    脸盆铁桶派用场。
    你传给我，
    我递给她；
    一人提一桶，
    人多力量大。
