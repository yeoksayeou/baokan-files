    We Saw "February 7th Storm"
    Liang Yongfu, Vice Chairman of the National Railway Workers' Union
    Li Zhengang, Assistant Director of the Beijing Railway Bureau
    When we were young, we worked on the Beijing-Hankou Railway and participated in the "February 7th" strike in 1923. Recently, the China Railway Art Troupe invited us to see the performance of "February 7th Storm". We were very excited while watching this play. The scenes in the play made us relive the years of arduous struggle in the past, and many comrades who shared life and death and shared hardships with us at that time appeared before our eyes again. At that time, the warlords in China relied on imperialism from Japan, Britain, the United States, France, etc., to engage in mutual wars, intensified the exploitation and oppression of workers and the broad masses of people. Our railway workers lived a slave life worse than cattle and horses, working for more than ten hours a day. When we returned home, our children cried and our wives screamed, lacking food and clothing, and not receiving wages for several months, sometimes only half wages, and also some worthless "tickets" issued by the warlords. Even so, we were in danger of being fired every day. Who cared about us workers at this time? It was the political party of our working class—the Communist Party—that told us: it was not that we had "bad luck", but because imperialism and feudal forces oppressed and exploited us. It also told us about the victory of the revolutionary struggle of the Russian worker brothers; told us the truth of revolution, and organized workers' clubs (i.e., trade unions) to fight against the enemy. In these revolutionary activities, many advanced workers, like Comrade Lin Xiangqian and others, joined the Party, recognized the road of the Chinese revolution, and carried out a resolute struggle under the leadership of the Party to realize their great ideals.
    This play relatively truly reflects the situation of the "February 7th" struggle. Many characters and plots in the play can be said to be based on real people and real events. The Communist Party member, our excellent railway worker Comrade Lin Xiangqian, under the threat of the enemy's guns and knives, heroically demonstrated the fighting will of the railway workers. The warlord executioner chopped off his arm, and he still shouted: "Without the order of the General Labour Union, we will never resume work! Our heads can be cut off, but work cannot be resumed!" Many excellent worker brothers sacrificed heroically in the struggle against the warlords in this way. Through the efforts of the actors, these situations were performed very realistically and powerfully.
    But we feel that the shortcomings are: our enthusiasm for organizing trade unions to carry out struggles at that time was even greater than what was shown in the play; the work of the trade union was better and more extensive than what was mentioned in the play; the general strike was more organized than what was shown in the play; the pickets were more orderly than what was shown in the play; and more importantly: the leadership of the Party was more intimate than what was shown in the play. The "Mr. Li" mentioned in the play is probably referring to Comrade Li Zhenying, whom we all know. All important issues in the trade union were discussed at Party meetings, and then Party members took the lead in implementing them. Of course, the great "February 7th" revolutionary struggle cannot be fully reflected in this one play. Generally speaking, this play is faithful to historical facts, the description is compact, the characterization is relatively clear, and the actors' performances are profound and serious, so it is relatively successful. We hope that they will continue to perform in various places, so that our railway workers, especially young comrades, can all see it. Looking at the past and comparing it with the present, we think it will be of great benefit.

    我们看了“二七风暴”
    铁路工会全国委员会副主席　梁永福
    北京铁路管理局局长助理　李震刚
    我们年青的时候，就在京汉路当工人，1923年参加了“二七”大罢工。最近，中国铁路文艺工作团请我们看“二七风暴”的演出。我们在看这出戏的时候，也都很激动，剧中的情景使我们重温了过去艰苦斗争的年月，许多在那时同生死、共患难的同志又出现在我们眼前。当时中国的各路军阀依靠日本、英、美、法等帝国主义互相混战，加紧剥削、压迫工人和广大人民，我们铁路工人过着牛马不如的奴隶生活，一天作十多个小时的工，回到家里孩子哭、老婆叫，缺吃少穿，几个月不开工资，有时只给一半工钱，还带一些军阀发行的不值钱的“票子”，就这样每天还有被开除的危险。这时候谁管我们工人呢？是我们工人阶级的政党——共产党，告诉我们：不是我们“命不好”，是因为帝国主义、封建势力压迫剥削我们。还告诉我们俄国工人兄弟革命斗争的胜利；给我们讲革命的道理，组织工人俱乐部（即工会）和敌人进行斗争。在这些革命活动中，许多先进工人，像林祥谦等同志入了党，认清了中国革命的道路，在党的领导下为了实现伟大理想进行了坚决的斗争。
    这个剧比较真实地反映了“二七”斗争的情况，剧中许多人物和情节可以说是真人真事，共产党员、我们优秀的铁路工人林祥谦同志，在敌人枪刀威逼之下，英勇地表现了铁路工人的斗争意志，军阀刽子手砍断了他的胳膊，他还高喊：“没有总工会的命令，决不复工！头可断，工不可复！”许多优秀的工人兄弟就是那样的在和军阀的斗争中英勇牺牲了。通过演员同志们的努力，把这些情况演得很逼真、有力。
    但我们感觉不足之处是：我们当时组织工会进行斗争的劲头比剧里演的还要足；工会的工作比剧里提到的还好、还多；大罢工的时候比剧里组织的还要有秩序；纠察队比剧里的还整齐；更重要的是：党的领导比剧里演的还要亲切。剧里交代的“李先生”恐怕就是指李震瀛同志，我们大家都认识他。工会中的一切重要问题都是经过党的会议上研究的，然后党员带动执行。当然，伟大的“二七”革命斗争，不能通过这一个剧完全反映出来。总的说来，这个剧是忠实于历史事实的，描写得紧凑，人物性格刻划得比较鲜明，演员们表演得深刻认真，所以是比较成功的。我们希望他们继续到各地去演出，让我们铁路工人，特别是青年同志都看一看。看看过去，比比现在，我们想是会有很大好处的。
