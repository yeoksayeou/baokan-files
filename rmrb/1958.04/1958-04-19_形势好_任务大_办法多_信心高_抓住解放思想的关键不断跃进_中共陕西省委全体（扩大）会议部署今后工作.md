The CCP Shaanxi Provincial Committee convened a plenary (enlarged) meeting from March 29th to April 11th. The meeting conscientiously studied the recent instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, reviewed the work of the province, and discussed and formulated a series of practical measures for developing local industry, developing scientific research, and strengthening theoretical study and cultural education to promote technological and cultural revolutions.

Currently, the situation in Shaanxi province is very good. This spring is a spring of soaring communist spirit and a spring of great leaps forward in socialist construction. The "Double-Anti" campaign and sweeping away "five airs" have brought many new features. The most prominent manifestation is the resurgence of the water conservancy high tide. As of the 5th, the province's this year's expansion of irrigated area has reached 10.08 million mu, exceeding the original plan of 10 million mu. The daily average is 310,000 mu, more than two and a half times the highest speed last winter. Afforestation progress in the province was very slow in late March, but in just seven days in April, it achieved a leap forward, overfulfilling the annual afforestation plan of 5 million mu.

With the leap forward in agricultural production, the province has begun to see a vigorous mass movement to improve agricultural tools, run industries by the whole people, and learn technology and culture by the masses. In a short period, members of the Xiagui Agricultural Cooperative in Weinan raised 130,000 yuan to build factories for fertilizer and comprehensive processing of agricultural products on their own. In the Baqiao District of Xi'an, each township and cooperative established 38 farmer's spare-time middle schools in seven days. The technological revolution and cultural revolution have become the most urgent tasks at present. The meeting correctly analyzed the current situation and also correctly estimated the shortcomings of the current work, mainly that the leadership lagged behind the actual situation; organizational and technical measures could not keep up with the needs of the soaring mass enthusiasm; and there were serious contradictions between measures and targets. The meeting believed that although this was a matter of ten fingers versus one finger, it should not be ignored and should be seriously resolved.

The meeting focused on discussing the issue of developing local industry, believing that it is achievable to make the output value of local industry catch up with or exceed the total output value of agriculture within five years or a little more. It required local committees and county committees to grasp agriculture with one hand and industry with the other, learn not only how to run cooperatives but also how to run factories, and immediately assign a secretary or member of the standing committee to be in charge of industry so that county, township, and cooperative-run industries can be universally mobilized. The meeting summarized some typical experiences of township and cooperative-run factories, illustrating that as long as they are willing to work and learn, learn while doing, they will quickly learn how to run factories. Members of the Baoguang and Guoguang Agricultural Cooperatives in Jingyang County invested their own money and used water power to drive wooden wheels to generate electricity, completely using local materials for self-production and self-use, and quickly established a comprehensive grain and cotton processing factory, which could also pump water for irrigation. Liu Kaifu, the director of the cooperative, only visited relevant factories and then took on the technical work of design and installation. This example greatly inspired the cadres present at the meeting. In order to fully support the industrial efforts of the special districts and counties, the meeting decided to transfer all 48 factories and mines under provincial management to the special districts and counties; to establish seven geological exploration teams in the special districts and the Guanzhong area; to advocate cities leading the countryside, large factories leading small factories, old factories leading new factories, state-owned leading local state-owned, and advanced leading backward. It was decided that large industrial colleges and universities and large factories and mines and related enterprises in industrial cities such as Xi'an should divide up the work and support the various special districts and counties.

In order to ensure increased agricultural production this year, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to continue to focus on water, fertilizer, and soil improvement. The meeting decided to vigorously promote the agricultural tool improvement movement currently emerging in various places, and in conjunction with current production and basic construction, select improved agricultural tools with universal significance for vigorous promotion. At the same time, attention should be paid to gradually preparing conditions for agricultural mechanization from the aspects of increasing the public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives, leveling land, and building terraces.

The meeting pointed out that the program of technological revolution is to be both red and expert, and the program of cultural revolution is to popularize cultural education, eliminate illiteracy, eliminate the four pests, change customs, and transform the country. The meeting proposed that everyone should attack the scientific fortress. In addition to requiring cadres at all levels to conscientiously implement the provincial committee's decisions on cadres planting experimental fields, leading cadres at the county level and above conducting special studies, and learning science and technology, it also made decisions on creating party theory publications, cultivating a contingent of proletarian intellectuals, improving party school work, and establishing a Shaanxi branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and local scientific research institutions such as agricultural machinery.

The meeting believed that the key to achieving the above tasks is to emancipate the mind. The current situation is developing rapidly, and "one day equals twenty years." The general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has become the action slogan of the broad masses. The leaders of the Hanzhong Special District were originally constrained by the old practice of first engaging in paddy fields. There was a debate in the leadership on whether to first build paddy fields or first engage in irrigated land. Later, they went deep into the masses and found that the masses who engaged in irrigated land first had made great achievements. As a result, they broke the old habit of first engaging in paddy fields and first engaged in irrigated land. The leadership had a unified thinking, the masses agreed, and the three-year water conservancy task was completed in twenty-four days. The meeting believed that ideological emancipation is a constant struggle and cannot be relaxed in the slightest.

The meeting believed that in order to improve the communist style, it is necessary to invigorate the spirit, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and advocate the selfless and fearless communist spirit, and oppose the thinking of not daring and not knowing how to think and being content with the status quo.

    形势好　任务大　办法多　信心高
    抓住解放思想的关键不断跃进
    中共陕西省委全体（扩大）会议部署今后工作
    本报讯　中共陕西省委3月29日到4月11日召开了省委全体（扩大）会议。会议认真学习了最近党中央和毛主席的指示，检查了全省工作，讨论制定了发展地方工业、发展科学研究工作、加强理论学习和文化教育等一系列实际措施，以促进技术革命和文化革命。
    当前，陕西全省形势很好。今年春天是共产主义精神高涨的春天，也是社会主义建设大跃进的春天。双反、扫五气，出现了许多新气象。突出的表现是，水利高潮再起，截至5日，全省今年度水利扩灌面积已达一千零八十万亩，超过原一千万亩的计划。每日平均三十一万亩，超过去冬最高速度的两倍半。3月下旬全省造林进展还很慢，但到4月短短七天一个飞跃，超额完成全年造林五百万亩的计划。
    农业生产的跃进，全省开始兴起了蓬蓬勃勃的群众改良农具、全民办工业和群众学习技术和学习文化的运动。渭南下邽乡农业社社员短期内集资十三万元，自己动手兴办肥料和农产品综合加工等工厂。西安坝桥区各乡、社七天内办起了三十八所农民业余中学。技术革命和文化革命已经成为当前最迫切的任务。会议正确分析了当前形势，也正确的估计了当前工作的缺点，主要是领导落后于实际；组织措施和技术措施赶不上高涨的群众热情的需要；措施与指标之间存在着严重的矛盾。会议认为，虽然这是十个指头与一个指头的问题，但决不容忽视，应当认真解决。
    会议着重讨论了发展地方工业的问题，认为五年内或稍多一些时间使地方工业产值，赶上或超过农业总产值，是可以实现的。要求各地委、县委要一手抓农业、一手抓工业，既学会办社又要学会办厂，立即抽出书记或常委一人专管工业，使县、乡、社办工业普遍行动起来。会议总结了一些乡、社办工厂的典型经验，说明只要肯干肯学、边干边学，很快就会学会办工厂的。泾阳县宝光、国光两个农业社社员，自己投资，利用水力推动木轮带动发电，完全就地取材，自产自用，很快办起一个粮棉综合加工厂，还可抽水灌溉。社主任刘开富只参观了有关工厂，就担负了设计、安装等技术工作。这个事例对到会干部启发很大。为了全力支援专、县办工业，会议决定：把省级管理的四十八个厂矿全部下放各专、县；成立各专区和关中地区的七个地质勘探队；提倡城市带农村、大厂带小厂、老厂带新厂、国营带地方国营、先进带落后。决定西安等工业城市的大、专工业院、校和大型厂矿及有关企业单位，分片包干支援各个专、县地区。
    为了确保今年农业增产，会议指出必须继续抓水、抓肥和抓改良土壤。会议决定，要狠狠地抓目前各地出现的农具改良运动，结合当前生产和基本建设，选择有普遍意义的改良农具大力推广。同时要注意从增加农业社的公共积累、平整土地、修梯田等方面，逐步为农业机械化准备条件。
    会议指出：技术革命的纲领是又红又专，文化革命的纲领是普及文化教育，扫除文盲，消灭四害，移风易俗，改造国家。会议提出要人人向科学的堡垒进攻，除要求各级干部认真执行省委关于干部种试验田、县级以上负责干部进行专题研究、学科学技术等决定外，还作了创办党的理论刊物、培养无产阶级知识分子队伍的决定，改进党校工作、成立中国科学院陕西省分院及农业机具等地方性科学研究机构的决定。
    会议认为，实现上述任务的关键是解放思想。目前形势发展很快，“一天等于二十年”。多快好省的建设总路线已经成为广大群众的行动口号。汉中专区领导思想上原来被先搞稻田的旧作法束缚着，领导上对先修稻田还是先搞水浇地有争论，后来深入群众，发现群众凡是先搞水浇地的，成绩就大。于是打破了先搞稻田的旧习惯，先搞水浇地，领导思想一致，群众同意，三年水利任务二十四天完成。会议认为思想解放是一个经常的斗争，不能稍有松懈。
    会议认为，要提高共产主义风格，必须振作精神，敢想、敢说、敢做，提倡见义勇为、大无畏的共产主义精神，反对不敢和不会思想、安于现状的思想。
