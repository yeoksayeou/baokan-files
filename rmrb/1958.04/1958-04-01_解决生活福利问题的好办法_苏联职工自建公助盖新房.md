　　A Good Way to Solve Welfare Problems
　　Soviet Workers Build New Houses with Public Assistance

　　(Our Dispatch) In recent years, the number of workers in the Soviet Union who build houses at their own expense has been increasing. Last year alone, the Soviet working people built 90,000 houses at their own expense, with a total area of 3.7 million square meters. Self-built housing with public assistance is a good way to solve the housing problem for workers. In the "Grushensky" State Farm in Kuibyshev Oblast, eleven newly relocated households quickly solved their housing problems last year using this method. For example, tractor driver Pingjukhov borrowed 5,000 rubles from the state and built a 60-square-meter house in four months.

　　In Novosibirsk, it is very common for workers to build their own houses. The city has now established a special committee to assist the masses in building their own houses. Many factories have organized special construction teams, and some have also opened training classes for stonemasons and carpenters. The Municipal Party Committee has also helped solve the problem of building materials by using local materials and local processing. Since the end of last year, the workers of the Novosibirsk Radio Equipment Factory have built 100 houses with their own efforts, each with two apartments. Shortly before the All-Union election holiday, 200 families from this factory had moved into new homes. In addition, they also repaired a power plant and laid more than 1,000 meters of water pipes. The workers of the Novosibirsk Radio Equipment Factory are currently building public welfare facilities such as nurseries and kindergartens, and have decided to build another 70 houses with their own efforts this year.

　　The Soviet government has given great support and assistance to workers who build their own houses. Last year alone, the Soviet Agricultural Bank loaned more than 520 million rubles to people who built their own houses, and the loans can be repaid in seven to ten years. This year, loans in this area will increase to 600 million rubles. In the past, the distribution of loans was carried out by various government ministries, but in order to better meet local needs, in the future it will be handled by the frontier regions and the Oblast Soviets.

　　解决生活福利问题的好办法
　　苏联职工自建公助盖新房
    本报讯　近年来，在苏联广大职工中间，自费建筑住宅的人日益增多。仅去年一年，苏联劳动人民就自费盖了九万所房子，总面积达三百七十万平方公尺。自建公助盖房是解决职工住宅问题的好办法。古比雪夫州的“格鲁申茨基”国营农场，去年有十一户新迁来的人家用这个办法很快解决了住房问题。如拖拉机手平久霍夫向国家贷款五千卢布，在四个月内便盖好了一套面积六十平方公尺的住宅。
    在新西伯利亚市，职工自力盖房的情况很普遍。现在该市已成立了一个专门委员会协助群众自力盖房。很多工厂组织了专门的建筑工作队，有的还开办了石工、木工训练班。党市委会并用就地取料、就地制材的办法帮助解决了建筑材料问题。新西伯利亚无线电器材厂的职工，从去年年底到现在，用自己的力量建成了一百所住房，每所有两套住宅。在不久以前全苏选举节日的前夕，这个工厂有二百家职工已搬入新居。此外，他们还修好了一个发电所、敷设了一千多公尺的水管道。新西伯利亚无线电器材厂的职工们目前正在兴建托儿所、幼儿园等公共福利业用房，并且决定今年再用自己的力量建筑七十幢住房。
    苏联政府对自力盖房的职工给了很大的支持和帮助。苏联农业银行去年一年就贷给了自力盖房的人五亿二千多万卢布，借款可以在七年至十年内还清。今年在这方面的贷款将增至六亿卢布。过去贷款的分配是由政府各部进行的，为了更加切合地方上的需要，今后将改由边疆区和州苏维埃办理。
