Relying on the Masses to Establish a County, Township, and Commune Statistical Network
Hebei Uses Statistical Work to Promote Production

(Reported by our newspaper) Hebei Province has achieved great success in using statistical work to promote the production upsurge and transform leadership styles in various counties. In the past two months, the statistical bureaus of Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Liaoning and other provinces have sent people to Hebei to study, and Xue Muqiao, Director of the State Statistical Bureau, has also gone to Hebei to help summarize experiences. Now, statistical personnel in counties, townships, and communes in Hebei Province are highly enthusiastic and striving to make greater contributions to promoting the production upsurge.

Hebei Province's utilization of statistical work to promote the production upsurge and transform leadership styles is mainly reflected in the following four aspects.

First, helping leading cadres grasp the overall situation and organize and lead production. Some areas also use statistical data for comparison to promote the production upsurge. This spring, when the masses worked hard for five days and ten days to complete crash projects such as water conservancy construction and spring wheat sowing, some counties could collect the production situation of each township and commune during the day on the same night, and compile it before dawn, printing and distributing it to leading cadres and relevant units to help them understand the situation in a timely manner and arrange work. In this way, statistical work has become a powerful weapon for promoting production and guiding work. When Luoping County was rushing to build a reservoir, Miao Ruhui, secretary of the Wangjiagou Township General Branch, saw the reservoir ranking list and found that their township was second to last. Anxiously, they rushed back to convene an emergency meeting of cadres, mobilizing men, women, old and young. The next day, all 115 reservoirs in the township started construction, and after several days of hard work, they won the first place in the county.

Second, enabling leading cadres to free themselves from figures and reports, and have more time to delve into problems and summarize experiences. For a long time, many Party and government cadres spent about 80% of their time in the countryside and communes collecting statistical figures, and had little time to do practical work. Every time a meeting was held, they would first grab a pile of figures, which had become a common practice. Cadres in Chengguan District and Zhongqiao District of Longyao County said that in the past, a meeting held every week took two days, but reporting figures took a day and a half, and the remaining half a day was only enough to superficially arrange work. Now, when county and township cadres hold meetings, each person has a copy of statistical data in hand. There is no need to report figures, and all the time can be used to exchange experiences and discuss issues. Not only are the meetings lively and active, but the problems are discussed in depth and solved thoroughly.

Third, after the county statistical section unified the management of statistical work, the problem of statistical forms flying everywhere, which had not been resolved for several years, has been completely solved. This is a major liberation for township and commune cadres. For example, Li Shuyou, the director of the Gangtie (Steel and Iron) Cooperative in Tongwangli Township, Dongguang County, used to spend most of his time every day reporting various statistical figures to batches of cadres from above, while also collecting various statistical data from the production teams. He was so busy that he had no time to participate in production, and only earned ten work points in the first half of last year. During the rectification campaign, the members raised more than 180 opinions, mainly criticizing the cooperative cadres for not participating in productive labor. Now, no one comes to him for statistical figures, and he does not need to run around to the teams. In the evening, the statistician comes to report to him the production situation of each team, and he has a better understanding of the situation. In the first three months of this year, he earned more than two hundred work points, and the members were satisfied and said, "Since the establishment of the cooperative in 1953, opinions have been raised every year, and now it has finally been changed."

Fourth, statistical work has changed from a so-called "unpopular" field to a "popular" one, and statistical cadres are highly enthusiastic and energetic. In order to complete statistical tasks, statistical cadres in many counties have been supplemented or adjusted, and statistical work has been valued. Many county magistrates and county party secretaries inquire about statistical data every day if they don't see it, and take the head of the statistical section with them when they go out for meetings. Cadres from many units actively help with statistical work, such as the telephone station actively helping to find each township to report statistical figures every night, and the messengers actively helping to distribute statistical data.

The statistical work of Hebei Province has improved after a period of rectification. A year ago, statistical work below the county level was not really established. The county statistical section believed that their main task was to do the statistical work prescribed by the higher authorities, which was the so-called "three broadcasts and two harvests" (investigating the sown area three times and the harvest volume twice). What the county party committee and county magistrate needed most was the statistics on the progress of production and the statistics on production preparation work. These statistics were the responsibility of the production office and other business units. Therefore, they believed that the statistical section was serving the higher authorities and was of little help to the county, so they did not care about the work of the statistical section. Statistical cadres were often sent to do other central tasks, while cadres from the county production office and other business units spent most of their energy collecting various statistical figures from townships and communes, causing statistical forms to fly everywhere in the countryside, and township and commune cadres were busy all day receiving personnel from various units who came to ask for statistical figures. They usually did not do statistical work, and could only randomly estimate and report temporarily, with one figure at a time, and the figures before and after did not match.

Last year, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee found the fundamental way to solve this problem, which was to combine statistical work with the mass production movement, break the old method of various units collecting statistical data separately, and stipulate that the statistical section should bear all the statistical tasks of various central tasks and production progress, and other units are not allowed to collect statistical figures themselves. The Hebei Provincial Bureau of Statistics, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, fully promoted this new system. More than a dozen counties, including Longyao and Dongguang, first broke through various difficulties. In addition to adjusting the cadres of the statistical section, it was also stipulated that township secretaries, cooperative accountants (renamed accounting statisticians), production team work recorders, etc., should be responsible for completing the statistical tasks arranged by the statistical section, and a complete statistical network was established from top to bottom. Because the statistical organization grasped the central link of combining various central tasks and serving the mass production upsurge, and the correct principle of relying on the masses to do statistics, it did completely assume the statistical tasks of various central tasks and production progress. They were not only able to provide various statistical data in a timely manner, but also the figures reported by various business units were accurate and complete. After Longyao and other counties first made remarkable achievements, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee once again instructed party committees at all levels to hand over rural statistical work to the statistical section for handling, so as to concentrate their energy, go deep into the masses, and discover and solve major problems existing in production in a timely manner. The Provincial Bureau of Statistics promptly forwarded the experience of Longyao and other counties to various places, and thus, this new system blossomed all over the place in more than 100 counties in Hebei Province.

    依靠群众建立县乡社统计网
    河北运用统计工作促进生产
    本报讯　河北省各县利用统计工作促进生产高潮，转变领导作风，获得了很大成绩。最近两个月来，山东、山西、陕西、甘肃、河南、湖北、湖南、辽宁等省统计局，都派人去河北学习，国家统计局局长薛暮桥也去河北帮助总结经验。现在，河北省的县、乡、社的统计人员热情高涨，力争在促进生产高潮中，作出更大的贡献。
    河北省利用统计工作促进生产高潮和转变领导作风，主要表现在以下四个方面。
    第一，帮助领导干部掌握全面情况，组织领导生产。有些地区还利用统计资料进行评比，促进生产高潮。今年春季，在群众苦战五天、苦战十天，完成水利建设、播种春麦等突击任务的时候，有些县可以在当晚收集各乡各社白天的生产情况，在天明以前整理完毕，印发各领导干部和有关单位，帮助他们及时地了解情况，布置工作。这样，统计工作便成为推动生产、指导工作的一个有力武器。泺平县突击修水库的时候，王家沟乡总支书记缪如惠看到张贴的水库榜，他们乡列为倒数第二位，急得连夜赶回召开干部紧急会议，发动男女老少，第二天就做到全乡一百十五个水库全面开工，苦战几天争得全县第一。
    第二，使领导干部从数字、报表中解脱出来，有更多的时间去钻研问题，总结经验。长期以来，很多党政干部下乡下社，大约用80％的时间搞统计数字，很少有工夫做实际工作。每次召开会议，也先抓一大堆数字，这已经形成一股风气。隆尧县城关区、中桥区的干部们说，过去每星期开一次会要两天时间，但是汇报数字就占去一天半，余下半天时间只能了草地布置工作。现在县、乡干部开会时候每人手里都有一份统计资料，用不着报数字，全部时间可以用来交流经验，讨论问题。不但会议生动活泼，而且问题讨论得深入，解决得彻底。
    第三，在县统计科统一管理统计工作以后，几年来解决不了的统计表满天飞的问题，已经得到了彻底解决。这对乡社干部来说是一大解放。例如东光县童王李乡钢铁社的主任李树友，过去每天有一大半时间要向上面来的一批批的干部报告各种统计数字，同时又要向各生产队收集各种统计资料，忙得没有时间参加生产，去年上半年只得了十个工分。整风期间，社员提了一百八十多条意见，主要批评社干部不参加生产劳动。现在没有人来向他要统计数字了，也用不着去各队乱跑。晚上统计员来向他报告各队生产情况，他的心中更有数了。今年头三个月，他得了二百多工分，社员满意地说“从1953年办社，年年提意见，现在总算改了”。
    第四，统计工作从所谓“冷门”变成了“热门”，统计干部热情高涨，干劲十足。为着完成统计任务，许多县的统计干部都得到了补充或调整，统计工作受到重视，许多县长、县委书记一天看不到统计资料就要查问，出去开会也带着统计科长。许多单位的干部主动帮助统计工作，如电话站每晚主动帮助找各乡报告统计数字，交通员主动帮着分发统计资料。
    河北省的统计工作，是经过一番整顿以后才好起来的。一年以前，县以下的统计工作实际上并没有真正建立起来。县统计科认为他们的主要任务是做上级所规定的统计工作，也就是所谓“三播两收”（调查三次播种面积，两次收获量）。县委和县长最需要的是生产进度的统计，以及生产准备工作的统计。这些统计是由生产办公室和其它业务单位负责的。因此，他们认为统计科是为上级服务的，对本县的帮助很小，所以都不关心统计科的工作。统计工作干部经常被派去做其它中心工作，而县生产办公室和其他业务单位的干部，却花费大部分的力量向乡社收集各种统计数字，弄得农村中统计表满天飞，乡社干部整天忙于接待来要统计数字的各单位的人员。他们平时不做统计工作，临时只能乱估乱报，一次一个数字，前后对不起来。
    去年河北省委找到了解决这个问题的根本办法，就是把统计工作同群众的生产运动结合起来，打破各单位分头收集统计资料的旧办法，规定统计科应当把各项中心工作和生产进度的统计任务全部负担起来，其它单位不准自己抓统计数字。河北省统计局根据省委指示，全力推行这个新的制度。隆尧、东光等十几个县首先突破了各种困难，除调整了统计科的干部外，还规定乡秘书、合作社会计员（改称会计统计员）、生产队记工员等，都应负责完成统计科所布置的统计任务，从上到下建立了一个完整的统计网。统计机构由于抓住了结合各项中心工作，为群众的生产高潮服务这一个中心环节，和依靠群众办统计的正确方针，确实把各项中心工作和生产进度的统计任务完全担负起来了。他们不但能够及时提供各种统计资料，而且比各业务单位报的数字又确实，又完整。隆尧等县首先做出了显著成绩以后，河北省委再次指示各级党委应像隆尧县委那样，把农村统计工作交给统计科去办理，以便集中精力，深入群众，及时发现和解决生产中存在的重大问题。省统计局及时把隆尧等县的经验转发各地，于是，这个新的制度，就在河北省一百多个县份遍地开花了。
