Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd. Scientists from eight southern provinces and cities, following the principle of "jointly improving, supporting each other, and strengthening collaboration," held a symposium on the 20th and 21st to discuss the collaboration issues in scientific research work among the eight provinces and cities.

The scope of collaboration discussed by the scientists included research on agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization, fertilizer research, rural power issues research, comprehensive utilization research of petroleum, sugarcane bagasse, coal, and seawater, research on plastics and artificial fibers, development of subtropical economic crops and medicinal plant research, as well as research on schistosomiasis and leprosy in the medical field.

The scientists participating in the symposium believed that scientific work among relevant regions should strengthen collaboration, unify forces, and continue to conduct comprehensive surveys of subtropical resources. At the same time, the speed of this work should be accelerated to meet the needs of the leap forward in national economic construction.

Fan Changjiang, Secretary-General of the State Council's Scientific Planning Commission, emphasized the importance of cultivating "native experts" regarding the issue of specialized talent for developing subtropical resources. He believes that in the current situation where there are not many experts with theoretical knowledge and rich practical experience in production, more attention should be paid to discovering "native experts" who have grown up in production practice, and we must be good at cultivating and using them. He believes that doing so is not only necessary but also entirely possible. For example, the proposal by rubber workers on Hainan Island to use technological reform methods to advance rubber tapping by several years was something that relevant scientific researchers had not even thought of. He believes that paying attention to the use and cultivation of "native experts" has another advantage, which is that it can enable veteran experts and "native experts" from mass practice to learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, so that they can quickly improve together and create more favorable conditions for the development of subtropical resources. At the symposium, representatives from Shanghai requested that scientific workers in Guangdong Province provide information on medicinal plants and aromatic plants, and collaborate on antibiotic research, termite eradication, and high rice yield research. At the same time, they are prepared to support Guangdong with Shanghai's existing achievements in plastics and artificial fibers. Representatives from Yunnan Province requested that scientific workers in Guangdong Province support Yunnan in the development of tropical and subtropical economic resources and medicinal plant research, and collaborate in the research of rare metals, non-ferrous metals, and schistosomiasis. Representatives from Guangdong Province also made requests to representatives from various provinces and cities regarding scientific research that needed collaboration.

The symposium also discussed methods of collaboration, and preliminary exchanges of views were made on issues such as the division of labor for related projects and the allocation of manpower, and preparations are being made to hold different thematic symposiums to resolve them.

More than 30 scientific workers' representatives from eight provinces and cities, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, and Shanghai, participated in this collaborative symposium.

### 共同提高　互相支援　加强协作  南方八省市科学家畅谈大协作  座谈会提出要发现、培养和使用“土专家”问题

    共同提高　互相支援　加强协作
    南方八省市科学家畅谈大协作
    座谈会提出要发现、培养和使用“土专家”问题
    新华社广州22日电　南方八个省、市的科学工作者按照“共同提高、互相支援、加强协作”的原则，在20日和21日举行座谈会，讨论了八省、市科学研究工作的协作问题。
    科学工作者们讨论协作的范围包括农业机械化、半机械化的研究，肥料研究，农村动力问题研究，石油、甘蔗渣、煤、海水等方面综合利用研究，塑料、人造纤维的研究，亚热带经济作物开发和药用植物研究，以及医学方面血吸虫病、麻疯病的研究等。
    参加座谈会的科学工作者们认为有关地区之间的科学工作应加强协作，统一力量，继续进行亚热带资源的全面综合考察。同时对这项工作要加快速度进行，以适应国家经济建设跃进的需要。
    国务院科学规划委员会秘书长范长江就开发亚热带资源的专门人才问题，着重指出培养“土专家”的重要性。他认为在目前有理论素养和有丰富生产实践经验的专家不多的情况下，更要注意发现在生产实践中成长起来的“土专家”，要善于培养和使用他们。他认为这样做不仅必要，而且完全可能。比如海南岛橡胶工人提出用改革技术的办法提前几年割胶的创议，就是有关科学研究人员还没有想到的问题。他认为注意使用和培养“土专家”还有一个好处，就是可以使老专家和从群众实践中来的“土专家”互相学习，取长补短，使他们都能很快共同提高，为开发亚热带资源创造更有利的条件。座谈会上，上海市代表要求广东省的科学工作者提供有关药用植物、芳香植物资料，和在抗生素研究、消灭白蚂蚁问题和水稻最高产量研究等方面进行协作，同时准备把上海在塑料、人造纤维等方面已有的成就，支援广东在这些方面的研究。云南省代表要求广东省的科学工作者在热带、亚热带经济资源开发和药用植物研究方面支援云南，同时在稀有金属、有色金属和血吸虫病研究方面进行协作。广东省代表也就有关科学研究需要协作的问题，分别向各省、市代表提出了要求。
    座谈会对协作的方法也进行了讨论，对有关项目的分工、人力调配等问题，都初步交换了意见，并准备举行不同的专题座谈会来解决。
    参加这次协作座谈会的有广东、广西、福建、江西、湖南、湖北、云南、上海等八省、市的科学工作者代表三十多人。
