Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 18th:
    The "Soviet Russia Daily" recently published an article exposing the cruel exploitation and plunder of the African people by capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France.

    The article stated that Africa provides the capitalist world with 96% of its diamonds, 80% of its cobalt, 60% of its gold, 42% of its antimony, 30% of its phosphorus, 40% of its chromium, 36% of its manganese, and 27% of its copper. Underneath African soil lies more than 80% of the capitalist world's proven uranium reserves.

    On the rich African land, British and French colonialists have been masters for a hundred years, devastating the local population and reaping astonishing profits from their plunder. Now, the tentacles of the United States, the world's largest imperialist robber, are extending to this inexhaustible source of super-profits and strategic raw materials.

    In the past eight years, US private investment in Africa has increased from $352 million to $1.2 billion. In Liberia alone, it reached $261 million in 1955. All of Liberia's rubber plantations belong to American companies. The American colonialists plunder Liberia to such an extent that US companies pay the Liberian government only five US cents per ton of iron ore. In the Union of South Africa, which produces gold, diamonds, and uranium, US private investment increased from $86 million in 1943 to $257 million in 1956.

    The article pointed out that the huge profits obtained by US, British, and French monopoly capital come from the cruel exploitation of Africans. In the uranium mines of the Belgian Congo, where most of the products are shipped to the United States, miners work fourteen to sixteen hours a day. Physical punishment is used as the fundamental "stimulus" for forcing black people to work.

    African workers bear the heaviest workload but earn far less than white workers. In the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, the weekly income of Africans engaged in agricultural labor is roughly equivalent to the income earned by European workers in ninety minutes. These workers with meager incomes and their families face starvation, disease, and early death. The average age of Africans is less than thirty years. The infant mortality rate is very high. In the British colony of Sierra Leone, the infant mortality rate for children under one year old is five hundred to six hundred per thousand.

    The article stated that many Africans are driven off their land and traded as slaves. In many African countries, local residents have no voting rights and no self-governing institutions.

    Although on their own land, black Africans do not have the right to move freely. Leaving their place of residence without permission leads to imprisonment, and black people in cities are also imprisoned for moving around the city without permission. These are the principles of Western-style "democracy" transplanted to the Union of South Africa.

### 美英法在非洲的大抢劫  “苏维埃俄罗斯报”揭露

    美英法在非洲的大抢劫
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”揭露
    新华社莫斯科18日电　“苏维埃俄罗斯报”最近发表了文章，揭露美、英、法等资本主义国家对非洲人民的残酷的剥削和掠夺。
    文章说，从非洲运往美国和欧洲的有占资本主义世界产量的96％的钻石，80％的钴，60％的金，42％的锑，30％的磷，40％的铬，36％的锰，27％的铜。在非洲地下还埋藏着资本主义世界已经探明的铀矿蕴藏量的80％以上。
    在富饶的非洲土地上，英法殖民者做了一百年的主人，摧残了当地的居民，获得了掠夺来的惊人的利润。现在世界上最大的帝国主义强盗美国的触须又伸向这个取之不竭的超额利润和战略原料的产地。
    最近八年来美国在非洲的私人投资额由三亿五千二百万美元增加到十二亿美元。仅在利比里亚，在1955年就达到二亿六千一百万美元。所有利比里亚的橡胶种植园都属于美国公司所有。美国殖民者对利比里亚的掠夺达到这样的程度：美国公司每吨铁矿砂仅付给利比里亚政府美金五分。在产金、钻石和铀的南非联邦，美国私人投资额从1943年的八千六百万美元增加到1956年的二亿五千七百万美元。
    文章指出，美、英、法垄断资本获得这种巨额利润来自对非洲人的残酷剥削。在大部分产品运往美国的比属刚果的铀矿里，矿工一昼夜工作达十四到十六小时。肉体上的惩罚是当作强迫黑人工作的根本“刺激因素”。
    非洲工人担负最重的工作但收入比白种工人低得多。在英国殖民地南罗得西亚，从事农业劳动的非洲人，一星期的劳动所得大约只等于欧洲工人九十分钟的劳动所得。这些收入极微的工人和他们的家庭遭到饥饿、疾病和早死的命运。非洲人的平均年龄不到三十岁。儿童的死亡率很高。在英国殖民地塞拉勒窝内，不满一岁的儿童的死亡率是一千名中五百到六百多名。
    文章说，许多非洲人被赶出自己的土地，并且被当作奴隶进行买卖。在非洲许多国家，当地居民没有投票权，没有自治机构。
    虽然是在自己的土地上，非洲黑人却没有自由行动的权利。他们没有经过允许而离开居留地，要关进监狱，城市黑人没有经过允许而在全城走动也要关进监狱。这就是移植在南非联邦的西方式“民主”的原则。
