Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Ministry of Textile Industry's Wool and Linen Conference decided to greatly increase the production of wool and linen textiles by using chemical fibers, wild fibers, and various other spinnable fibers.

The shortage of wool and jute has, in the past, to some extent limited the growth of wool and linen textile production. However, there have always been two different opinions within the wool and linen textile production sector regarding expanding raw material resources. Some people believe that we should make full use of China's abundant fiber resources to expand production; others worry that this will affect quality and lack confidence. At this conference, the representatives cited examples of industrially advanced countries around the world using blends of pure wool and chemical fibers to create many woolen fabrics with qualities surpassing pure wool fabrics, proving that as long as appropriate measures are taken, incorporating a portion of chemical fibers into wool can completely guarantee or improve quality. Representatives from the Shanghai No. 2 Wool Spinning Factory also introduced the finished product of gabardine woven by the factory with 30% viscose fiber, which is soft, durable, and very popular in the market. The representatives introduced the situation of using fibers such as yak wool, pig bristles, and rabbit hair in various regions, indicating that although the quality of these blended fabrics is not yet comparable to pure wool fabrics, they are worthy of further research, improvement, and promotion.

The representatives also exchanged views on the technical issues of blending chemical fibers or wild raw materials, and unanimously believed that these problems could be gradually resolved to make blended fabrics of good quality and low price.

After reaching a consensus, the conference proposed that the amount of viscose fiber blended into pure wool in wool textile production this year should be increased from the originally planned 500 tons to 2,500 tons, or even more; fibers such as cashmere, rabbit hair, and yak wool should also be utilized as much as possible. In terms of linen textiles, in addition to the widespread use of 10% cotton stalk bark in ordinary sacks, efforts will be made to use flax, which grows in large quantities in Gansu, Qinghai, and other places, to blend with jute for sack production; ramie will be blended with cotton to weave clothing fabrics. In addition, measures such as rationally reducing raw material quotas will be adopted to solve the raw material problem. After taking the above measures, it is estimated that the annual output of wool textiles can reach 21.38 million meters, and wool yarn can reach more than 8.3 million kilograms, both 13% higher than the original plan; sack production can reach 100 million, 12% higher than the original plan; flax fabrics and ramie fabrics will also have considerable growth.

    纺织工业部毛麻会议决定
    采用代用纤维增产毛麻纺织品
    据新华社10日讯　纺织工业部毛麻会议决定大量采用化学纤维、野生纤维和各种其他可纺纤维，来增产毛麻纺织品。
    羊毛、黄麻不足，过去曾在一定程度上限制了毛麻纺织品产量的增长。但是毛麻织品生产部门在扩大原料资源上一直存在着两种不同的意见。有些人认为应尽量利用我国丰富的纤维资源，扩大产量；另一些人却担心这样会影响质量，信心不足。在这次会议上，代表们举出世界工业先进国家用纯毛和化学纤维混纺许多毛织品，质量超过纯毛织品的实例，证明只要采取适当措施，在羊毛中掺用一部分化学纤维，完全可以保证或提高质量。上海第二毛纺厂的代表还介绍了这个厂在华达呢中掺用30％的粘胶纤维织出的成品，质地柔软耐用，颇受市场欢迎。代表们介绍各地掺用牦牛毛、猪毛绒、兔毛等纤维的情况，说明这些混纺织品的质量目前虽然还比不上纯毛织品，也值得进一步研究改进和推广。
    代表们还就掺用化学纤维或野生原料的技术问题交换了意见，一致认为这些问题可以逐步解决，使混纺织品做到物美价廉。
    会议在统一认识之后，提出今年毛纺织方面在纯毛中掺用粘胶纤维的数量，要由原订的五百吨增加到二千五百吨，或再多一些；山羊绒、兔毛、牦牛毛等纤维也要尽可能加以利用。在麻纺织方面，除在一般麻袋中普遍掺用10％的棉杆皮以外，将设法利用甘肃、青海等地大量生长的胡麻与黄麻混纺麻袋；利用苎麻与棉花混纺织成衣着用布。此外还要采用合理降低原料定额等解决原料问题的措施。采取以上措施以后，预计全年毛纺织品的产量可以达到二千一百三十八万公尺，毛线可以达到八百三十多万公斤，都比原计划提高13％；麻袋可以达到一亿条，比原计划提高12％；亚麻布、苎麻布也将有相当增长。
