Give Full Play to the Role of Machines
Shanxi State-Owned Coal Mines Achieve Leap Forward Without Adding Workers

(Our Taiyuan Dispatch, April 27) Shanxi State-owned coal mines originally planned to add 12,000 new workers this year to achieve the leap forward plan. Now, by coming up with ways to improve mechanical efficiency, without requiring state investment or adding workers, the leap forward plan has been raised even higher than originally planned.

Shanxi state-owned coal mines have a high degree of mechanization, with some mines reaching about 80% to 90%. However, the efficiency of coal miners has grown very slowly, and the mechanical utilization rate has declined year by year. The number of underground workers has risen in a straight line. For example, in the Datong Coal Mine, which has the highest degree of mechanization, the coal mining efficiency last year was only a little more than 30% higher than in 1950. The average amount of coal mined per month by each combine in this mine was more than 4,000 tons less than in 1954, and the amount of coal mined by coal cutters was also more than 3,000 tons less. Some mines have put the machines aside and used manual mining.

Regarding the reasons for the poor mechanical utilization, some people in Shanxi state-owned coal mines used to think that it was because the workers' skills were low, and some people thought it was because the geological conditions in Shanxi coal mines were not good, but it has never been thoroughly clarified or resolved. Recently, the electromechanical departments conducted in-depth investigations and found that the reason was due to the imbalance in the distribution of machinery. The degree of mechanization of coal mining underground is very high, but in the coal transportation system, people push carts and oxen pull carts. Due to the limitations of transportation capacity, the capacity of coal mining machinery cannot be fully utilized; secondly, it is due to the unreasonable labor organization. The electromechanical workers and coal miners are separated. The coal miners only care about output and disregard the damage to the machines. The electromechanical workers only care about the utilization and maintenance of the machines and do not ask about the production situation. They often stick to their own responsibilities, argue and quarrel, which affects the normal utilization of the machines; the most important reason is that the leadership does not pay attention to the utilization of machines. The leaders of some mines have an attitude of underestimating the role of machines. They do not mobilize workers to study and improve technology. When they encounter difficulties, they move away the machines and replace them with manual mining.

In the rectification movement, the leading cadres first criticized the idea of ignoring the utilization of machines, and then went down to the mine with the workers to study and analyze the geological conditions, and promote the experience of operating machines under different conditions. And took effective measures to address the existing problems. The solution to the problem of underground transportation not keeping up with coal mining is to: use a large number of small machines in the transportation system to replace people pushing carts and oxen pulling carts. The solution to the unreasonable labor organization is to: implement the integration of electromechanical workers and coal miners in terms of labor organization. Electromechanical workers become members of the coal mining team and are uniformly commanded by the coal mining team leader. (Zhang Chao)

### 充分发挥机器的作用  山西国营煤矿不添人也跃进

    充分发挥机器的作用
    山西国营煤矿不添人也跃进
    本报太原27日电　山西国营煤矿原计划今年要增加一万二千名新工人，才能实现跃进计划。现在，由于从提高机械效率方面想出了办法，既不要国家投资、也不要增加工人，跃进计划还比原来提高了很多。
    山西国营煤矿的机械化的程度很高，有的矿已经达到80％到90％左右。可是，采煤工人的效率却增长的十分缓慢，机械利用率年年下降。井下工人数都直线上升。如机械化程度最高的大同煤矿，去年的采煤工效率只比1950年提高了30％多一点。这个矿康拜因每台每月采的煤比1954年平均少四千多吨，截煤机采的煤也少三千多吨。有些矿把机器搁置起来，用人工开采。
    关于机械利用情况不好的原因，过去山西国营煤矿有些人认为是工人技术低，有的人认为是由于山西煤矿地质条件不好，但是一直没有彻底弄清，也没有加以解决。最近，机电部门进行了深入调查，发现其原因是由于机械分布不平衡。井下的采煤机械化程度很高，但在运煤系统却有用人推车，牛拉车的。由于运输能力的限制，采煤机械的能力不能很好的发挥；其次，是由于劳动组织不合理。机电工和采煤工是分开的，采煤工只管产量，不顾机器的损坏，机电工只管机器的利用、维护，不问生产情况。他们各自为了自己的职责，经常各执一端，扯皮吵架，影响机械的正常利用；最主要原因还是领导上对机械的利用不重视。有些矿的领导有一种轻视机械作用的情绪，他们不去发动工人研究和提高技术，一碰到困难，就搬走机器，换上人工开采。
    在整风运动中，领导干部首先批判了忽视机械利用的思想，然后下井和工人一起，研究分析地质条件，推广机器在不同条件下进行操作的经验。并且针对存在的问题采取了有力的措施。对井下运输赶不上采煤的问题解决的办法是：在运输系统大量采用小型机械，代替人推车和牛拉车。解决劳动组织不合理的办法是：从劳动组织上实行机电工和采煤工合一。机电工成为采煤组成员之一，由采煤队长统一指挥。　（张超）
