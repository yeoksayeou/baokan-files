Lightweight Radios and Amplifiers

    The "Leap Forward" brand three-purpose radio recently produced by the service department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Broadcasting Station can not only receive radio broadcasts and play records, but can also be used for giving reports. In addition, it can also drive twenty or thirty loudspeakers within a radius of ten li.
    If a pastoral production cooperative has such a radio, loudspeakers can be installed on most yurts.
    The Guangzhou Guoguang Broadcasting Equipment Factory has successfully trial-produced a portable amplifier.
    This amplifier uses six dry batteries as a power source and can amplify the sound by seven to fifteen times without an amplifying machine. It can be heard at a distance of 500 meters. It weighs only six pounds and can be carried while walking and speaking. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    轻便的收音机和扩音器
    内蒙古自治区人民广播电台服务部最近制成的“跃进”牌三用收音机，除能收听广播电台的广播和放送唱片外，还能利用它做报告。另外在半径十华里的范围内，它还能带动二、三十个喇叭。
    一个牧业生产合作社有这样一部收音机，就可以在大部分蒙古包上安上喇叭。
    广州国光广播器材厂试制手提式扩音器成功。
    这种扩音器用六个手电池作电源，不用扩声机就能把声音扩大七倍到十五倍。在五百公尺远的地方也可以听到。它的重量只六斤多，可由人提着它边走边讲话。　（据新华社讯）
