Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th Dispatch: More than 20 representatives from five social organizations, Diet members, prominent figures from all walks of life, and overseas Chinese representatives held a meeting in Tokyo on the 7th to discuss the issue of resolving the Liu Lianren incident. They unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the irresponsible attitude of the Japanese government.

Representatives from five groups, including the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Committee, the National Council for the Restoration of Japan– China Diplomatic Relations, the Executive Committee for the Memorial Service for Chinese Martyrs, and the Liaison Council of Chinese Returnees, reported on their negotiations with the Japanese government at the meeting. The representatives of these five groups said that they visited Aichi Kiichi, Chief Cabinet Secretary, on the 3rd, and Yoshida, Director of the Cabinet Secretariat's Deliberation Office, and Okada, Section Chief of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on the 4th, demanding that the Japanese government take responsibility for handling the Liu Lianren incident. However, these relevant government officials did not acknowledge the fact that Liu Lianren was illegally abducted. They stated that regardless of the past situation, they would simply send Liu Lianren back to China as soon as possible.

Participants in the meeting all expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese government's attitude. The meeting decided that the five groups would visit relevant government departments again to question the government's responsibility.

    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本五个社会团体的代表，国会议员，各界名流以及华侨代表等二十多人7日在东京举行会议，讨论解决刘连仁事件的问题。他们一致对日本政府的不负责任态度表示不满。
