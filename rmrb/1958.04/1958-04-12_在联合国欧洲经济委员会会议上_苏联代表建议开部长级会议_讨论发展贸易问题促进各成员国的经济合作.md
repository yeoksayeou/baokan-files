Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 10th: According to TASS, at the 13th session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the head of the Soviet delegation, Zakharov, proposed on the 10th to develop mutually beneficial economic cooperation among the member states of the organization, and suggested convening a ministerial meeting of the member states at the end of this year to discuss the issue of trade development.

Zakharov said that the 13th session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe is being held under circumstances very different from a year ago. Currently, the movement in the world to strive for normal good-neighborly relations and to promote the spirit of mutual trust and cooperation in international relations is strengthening. Zakharov pointed out the great significance of the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on unilaterally ceasing nuclear tests, and also mentioned the Soviet government's proposal to convene a high-level meeting, which, in addition to discussing other issues, could also study economic issues of concern to all countries.

Zakharov suggested that the Economic Commission for Europe organize regional comprehensive and mutually beneficial cooperation, thereby contributing to the common struggle for the establishment of international trust. In this regard, he suggested first organizing the exchange of experience in the production of daily necessities among member states, and specifically suggested that the meeting discuss how to arrange such cooperation within the scope of the Economic Commission for Europe.

Zakharov then talked about the Soviet proposal to convene a ministerial meeting to discuss the development of trade issues. He said that this meeting could discuss methods to develop long-term trade among the member states of the Economic Commission for Europe, and could also discuss further exchanges of experience in technological innovation and production organization according to trade conditions. This meeting could be convened at the end of 1958, and the necessary preparations for convening the meeting could be entrusted to the secretariat of the Economic Commission for Europe and its Foreign Trade Committee.

The head of the Soviet delegation pointed out that if the increasing economic difficulties of Western European countries are taken into account, and if the recent recession in industrial production in the United States and the resulting disasters for the working people, which have made world public opinion very uneasy, are taken into account, then the significance of the economic cooperation program proposed by the Soviet Union becomes particularly important. He emphasized that to solve economic problems, one should not think of solutions from the perspective of militarization, but should think of solutions from the perspective of implementing broad and beneficial cooperation among countries. In this regard, he reminded that the Soviet Union had placed orders with foreign countries during the difficult 1930s, providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of working people.

The head of the Soviet delegation finally pointed out that the Soviet Union does not object to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe establishing ties with the Organization for European Economic Cooperation. Representatives of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation can participate in the work of the Economic Commission for Europe and its standing bodies together with representatives of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, with the right to speak.

The speech of the Soviet representative became the focus of attention at the meeting. The French representative admitted in his speech that the Soviet proposal was very serious and important. He believed that the Soviet proposal was worth studying.

The meeting also discussed the issue of accepting the German Democratic Republic as a member of the Economic Commission for Europe. The Czechoslovak representative suggested accepting the German Democratic Republic as a member of the Economic Commission for Europe. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Yugoslavia supported this suggestion. Representatives from West Germany and France expressed their opposition. The meeting decided to include this issue in the report submitted by the Economic Commission for Europe to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

Professor Oskar Lange (Poland) was re-elected as Chairman of the 13th session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe at the meeting on the 10th.

    在联合国欧洲经济委员会会议上
    苏联代表建议开部长级会议
    讨论发展贸易问题促进各成员国的经济合作
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦10日讯：苏联代表团团长扎哈罗夫10日在联合国欧洲经济委员会第十三届会议上建议发展这个组织各成员国之间互利的经济合作，并且建议在今年年底召开各成员国部长级会议，来讨论发展贸易的问题。
    扎哈罗夫说，联合国欧洲经济委员会第十三届会议是在和一年前大不相同的情况下召开的。目前，世界上争取建立正常的睦邻关系、争取在国际关系中发扬相互信任和合作的精神的运动，在日益加强。扎哈罗夫指出了苏联最高苏维埃关于单方面停止核试验的决议的重大意义，并且提到了苏联政府关于召开高级会议的建议，这个会议除了讨论其他问题之外，还可以研究各国都关心的经济问题。
    扎哈罗夫建议欧洲经济委员会组织区域性的全面互利合作，从而对争取建立国际信任的共同斗争作出贡献。在这方面，他建议首先组织各成员国交流生产日用品的经验，并且具体建议会议讨论用什么方式来在欧洲经济委员会范围内安排这种合作。
    扎哈罗夫接着谈到苏联关于召开部长级会议来讨论发展贸易问题的建议。他说，这个会议可以讨论用什么方法来发展欧洲经济委员会各成员国的长期贸易问题，还可以讨论按贸易条件进一步交流技术革新和生产组织方面的经验的问题。这个会议可以在1958年年底召开，有关召开会议的必要准备可以委托欧洲经济委员会秘书处和它的对外贸易委员会进行。
    苏联代表团团长指出，如果考虑到西欧国家的经济困难日益严重，如果考虑到最近美国的工业生产衰退给劳动人民造成的灾难，并且使得世界舆论非常不安，那么，苏联所建议的经济合作纲领的意义就显得特别重大了。他着重指出，要想解决经济问题，不应该从军事化方面去想办法，而应该从实行各国广泛而有益的合作方面去想办法。在这方面，他提醒说，苏联在困难的三十年代曾经向外国定货，使不下几十万劳动人民得到了工作。
    苏联代表团团长最后指出，苏联不反对联合国欧洲经济委员会同欧洲经济合作组织建立联系，欧洲经济合作组织的代表可以和经济互助委员会的代表一道参加欧洲经济委员会及其常设机构的工作，具有发言权。
    苏联代表的发言成了会议注意的中心。法国代表在发言中承认，苏联的建议是十分严肃和重要的。他认为，苏联的建议值得研究。
    会议还讨论了接受德意志民主共和国为欧洲经济委员会成员国的问题。捷克斯洛伐克代表建议接受德意志民主共和国为欧洲经济委员会会员国。苏联、波兰和南斯拉夫代表支持这个建议。西德和法国的代表则表示反对。会议决定把这个问题列入欧洲经济委员会向联合国经济社会理事会提出的报告中。
    奥斯卡·兰格教授（波兰）在10日的会议上再度当选为联合国欧洲经济委员会第十三届会议主席。
