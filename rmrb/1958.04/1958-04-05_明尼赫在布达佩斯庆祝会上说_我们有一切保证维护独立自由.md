Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 3rd: A grand celebration of the 13th anniversary of Hungary's liberation was held tonight at the National Opera House here.

Attending the celebration were Hungarian party and government leaders such as Kádár, Dobi, and Münnich, as well as representatives from all walks of life. The Soviet party and government delegation led by Khrushchev, as well as foreign diplomatic envoys, were invited to participate in the conference.

After the President of the Presidential Council of the Hungarian People's Republic, Dobi, delivered a speech, the Prime Minister of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, Münnich, spoke first. He said that Hungary has made great achievements in the thirteen years since liberation, and the Hungarian working people have never lived so well as they do now.

Münnich said that the past party and state leaders had committed a series of serious errors in political aspects and in organizing and leading economic construction. We are making unremitting efforts to learn from these mistakes and absolutely avoid repeating them.

Münnich pointed out that the achievements gained since Hungary's liberation are inseparable from the Soviet Union's selfless friendly assistance and support. In the autumn of 1956, the Soviet Union, at the invitation of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, helped the Hungarian revolutionary forces to eliminate the counter-revolution, which is a shining example of the fraternal friendship between Hungary and the Soviet Union.

Münnich said that on this anniversary, we can say that there is every guarantee to safeguard our independence and freedom. He said that Hungary is a country of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it is more consolidated than in the past. We will never tolerate any attempts to weaken or undermine the people's power.

He said that in addition to workers and laboring peasants, the laboring intellectuals are also increasingly supporting the policies of the party and the government. They prove with their actions that they have chosen socialism.

Münnich said that Hungary's independence and freedom are built on a reliable foundation, because Hungary is an equal member of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. He said that we unite our strength within the framework of the Warsaw Pact.

Next, Khrushchev spoke at the meeting. He first congratulated the Hungarian working people on the great achievements they have made in socialist construction and in the struggle to consolidate peace and the security and independence of the motherland. He said that the achievements made by the Hungarian people in the recent period after the counter-revolutionary events of October 1956 fully demonstrate the great vitality of the Hungarian state and social system. He pointed out that Hungary has been able to achieve such achievements because the Hungarian working people are closely united around the party and the government, and due to the outstanding leadership of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party headed by Kádár.

When talking about the international situation and the Soviet Union's foreign policy, Khrushchev pointed out that at present, there is no other sensible policy besides the policy of peaceful coexistence and wise forbearance. The so-called wise forbearance means that no country is in a privileged position.

Münnich's and Khrushchev's speeches were constantly interrupted by warm applause.

After the celebration, a grand artistic performance was held.

On the same morning, a solemn ceremony was held in Budapest to lay wreaths at the Soviet Army Monument on Freedom Square and the Hungarian Freedom and Independence Fighters Monument on Heroes' Square.

Hungarian party and government leaders and members of the Soviet party and government delegation attended the wreath-laying ceremony.

    明尼赫在布达佩斯庆祝会上说
    我们有一切保证维护独立自由
    新华社布达佩斯3日电　匈牙利解放十三周年庆祝大会今晚在这里的国家歌剧院隆重举行。
    出席庆祝大会的有匈牙利党和政府的领导人卡达尔、道比、明尼赫等，以及各界代表。以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联党和政府代表团以及各国外交使节应邀参加了大会。
    大会由匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比致词后，匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫首先讲了话。他说，匈牙利在解放以来的十三年中取得了巨大的成就，匈牙利劳动人民从来没有像现在生活得这样好。
    明尼赫说，过去的党和国家领导人在政治方面以及在组织和领导经济建设方面犯过一系列的严重错误。我们正在始终不渝地努力从这些错误中吸取教训，绝对避免重犯这些错误。
    明尼赫指出，匈牙利解放以来所获得的成就是同苏联的无私的友好援助和支持分不开的。1956年秋天苏联应匈牙利工农革命政府的邀请帮助匈牙利的革命力量消灭了反革命，这就是匈苏兄弟友谊的光辉例证。
    明尼赫说，在这个纪念日我们可以说，有一切保证来维护我们的独立和自由。他说，匈牙利是一个无产阶级专政的国家，它比过去更加巩固了。我们决不容忍任何削弱和破坏人民政权的企图。
    他说，除工人和劳动农民外，劳动知识分子也越来越支持党和政府的政策。他们以自己的行动证明：他们选择了社会主义。
    明尼赫说，匈牙利的独立和自由建立在可靠的基础上，因为匈牙利是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的平等的一员。他说，我们在华沙条约的范围内把自己的力量团结起来。
    接着，赫鲁晓夫在会上讲话。他首先祝贺匈牙利劳动人民在社会主义建设中、在为巩固和平和祖国的安全和独立的斗争中所获得的巨大成就。他说，经过1956年10月反革命事件以后，匈牙利人民最近一个时期所获得的成就，充分表现了匈牙利国家和社会制度的巨大生命力。他指出，匈牙利所以能够取得这样的成就，是由于匈牙利劳动人民紧密地团结在党和政府的周围，由于以卡达尔为首的匈牙利社会主义工人党中央的卓越领导。
    在谈到国际局势和苏联的外交政策时，赫鲁晓夫指出，在目前除了和平共处和明智地忍让的政策之外，再没有别的明智的政策了。所谓明智的忍让就是没有任何一个国家处于特权地位。
    明尼赫和赫鲁晓夫的讲话不断为热烈的掌声所打断。
    庆祝大会结束后，举行了盛大的艺术表演。
    同一天上午，布达佩斯市举行了隆重的仪式，向自由广场上的苏军纪念碑和英雄广场上的匈牙利争取自由独立战士纪念碑献花圈。
    匈牙利党和政府领导人、苏联党和政府代表团人员都出席了献花圈仪式。
