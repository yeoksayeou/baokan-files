    (Our report) The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio dispatched fourteen film crews to capture the vivid scenes of the people of the capital waging war against sparrows.
    In the film, we can see the real situation of Beijing Vice Mayor Wang Kunlun issuing combat orders, Comrade Liu Shaoqi personally supervising the battle at the front line, and friends from the Soviet Embassy all joining the battle; we can see the grand scenes of men and women, old and young, in the city and suburbs, attacking sparrows in the air, on the water, and on the ground; we can see the scenes of trucks loaded with dead sparrows being exhibited everywhere.
    While fighting sparrows and maintaining production, the staff of the Newsreel Studio are working day and night to produce this film, which is expected to meet the Beijing audience on the day after the end of the sparrow eradication campaign (April 22nd).

    歼雀战影片今天同观众见面
    本报讯　中央新闻纪录电影制片厂派出了十四个摄影队，把首都人民大战麻雀的生动情景拍摄下来了。
    影片里我们可以看到北京市王昆仑副市长发布战斗命令、刘少奇同志亲临前线督战、苏联大使馆的朋友们也全部投入了战斗的实况；可以看到市内和郊区男女老少在空中、水面、地上轰打麻雀的壮大场面；可以看到载满了大卡车的死雀在各处展览的情形。
    新闻电影制片厂职工在打麻雀、生产两不误的情况下，现在正连夜突击这部影片，预计在围剿麻雀结束的次日（22日），即可首先与北京观众见面。
