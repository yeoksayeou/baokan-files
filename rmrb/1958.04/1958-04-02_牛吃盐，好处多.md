    Cows Eat Salt, Many Benefits
    Some cattle have poor appetites, are large-framed but not fat, and lack pulling power. How can these cattle be made to have strong appetites? The best way is to feed the cattle with a little salt. After the cattle eat salt, their stomachs are stimulated, and their appetites will gradually increase, their fat will slowly thicken, and their fur will grow shiny. When feeding salt, it is important to pay attention, as too much or too little is not good. It is best to feed one catty of salt per month, divided into many feedings.
