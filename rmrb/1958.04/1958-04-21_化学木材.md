Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 19th. Luo Zou, Wu Shizhen, and other technicians from the Shanghai Match, Plastics, and Brush Industrial Corporation's laboratory, have recently successfully trial-produced a substitute for natural cork and wood - rigid polyvinyl chloride foam (also known as chemical wood). It has the characteristics of being colorless, odorless, lightweight, and waterproof, making it an excellent material for industrial insulation, shock absorption, sound insulation, and moisture prevention.

    Rigid polyvinyl chloride foam is particularly suitable for manufacturing marine lifesaving equipment, shipbuilding industry, etc. After this plastic is dyed into various bright colors and made into thin sheets, it can be glued with wood or other materials, making it an ideal material for decorating ceilings and walls in the construction industry.

    It is extremely lightweight, and laboratory staff can easily lift it with just one hand.

    化学木材
    新华社上海19日电　上海火柴、塑料、毛刷工业公司试验室技术员罗驺、吴世珍等，最近试制成功一种天然软木和木材的代用品——聚氯乙烯硬质泡沫塑料（又称化学木材）。它具有无色无臭、体质轻、不透水等特点，是工业用的保暖、避震、隔音、防潮极好的材料。
    聚氯乙烯硬质泡沫塑料特别适用于制造航海救生用具、造船工业等。这种塑料染成各种艳丽的色彩制成薄片后，同木材或其他物质胶合，又是建筑工业中用来装饰天花板、墙壁的理想材料。
    它的体质极轻，试验室工作人员只要用一只手轻轻一托就可举起。
