Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 19th - Yang Jinxing, a Kuomintang military intelligence agent who murdered General Yang Hucheng and Luo Shiwen and Che Yaoxian, responsible persons of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party during the War of Resistance Against Japan, was sentenced to death at a public trial held in Chongqing today.

The criminal Yang Jinxing was the warden of the Sino-American Special Technical Cooperation Organization, a KMT secret service agency located in Ciqikou, Chongqing. In September 1949, Yang Jinxing participated in the secret meeting held by Kuomintang secret service chiefs Mao Renfeng and Zhou Yanghao to plot the murder of General Yang Hucheng, and suggested assassinating him by stabbing his waist with a short knife and stuffing his mouth and throat with a handkerchief. After General Yang Hucheng was escorted from Xifeng Prison in Guizhou to Chongqing, Yang Jinxing, together with secret agent Xiong Xiang and others, assassinated General Yang Hucheng and his son, young daughter, as well as General Yang's secretary Song Qiyun and his wife and children, with daggers in a secret room of the Sino-American Special Technical Cooperation Organization. For his "meritorious service" in the massacre, Yang Jinxing was "commended" by secret service chief Mao Renfeng.

Yang Jinxing was a major culprit in the Zhazidong massacre on November 27, 1949, in which the Chongqing Sino-American Special Technical Cooperation Organization carried out a large-scale massacre of Communist Party members and revolutionary progressive people. In this massacre, Yang Jinxing personally murdered Huang Xiansheng, a subordinate of General Zhang Xueliang, and many others.

In October 1946, Yang Jinxing personally murdered Luo Shiwen and Che Yaoxian, and then used gasoline and firewood to burn the bodies to destroy the evidence.

This counter-revolutionary murderer, stained with blood and guilty of heinous crimes, went into hiding in the countryside after liberation, using an assumed name and posing as a "poor peasant" in Qingju Township, Nanchong City, Sichuan, in an attempt to remain in hiding for a long time. He was arrested and brought to justice by public security organs in June 1955.

    杀害杨虎城、罗世文等的凶犯
    反革命刽子手杨进兴正法
    新华社重庆19日电　杀害杨虎城将军和抗日战争时期中共四川省委负责人罗世文、车耀先的国民党军统特务杨进兴，今天在重庆举行的公审大会上被判处死刑。
    杨犯进兴是国民党设在重庆磁器口的特务机关——中美特种技术合作所的看守长。1949年9月，杨进兴参加了国民党特务头子毛人凤，周养浩等召开的密谋杀害杨虎城将军的会议，并献策用短刀刺腰、用帕子蒙塞嘴喉的办法进行杀害。当杨虎城将军从贵州息峰狱中被押到重庆后，杨进兴即伙同特务熊祥等用匕首将杨虎城将军和他的儿子、幼女以及杨将军的秘书宋绮云夫妇和孩子等暗杀于中美特种技术合作所的密室内。因屠杀有“功”，杨进兴曾得到特务头子毛人凤的“嘉奖”。
    杨进兴是1949年11月27日重庆中美特种技术合作所对共产党员、革命进步人士进行大屠杀的渣滓洞血案中的一个主要凶手。这次为杨进兴亲手杀害的有张学良将军的部下黄显声等多人。
    1946年10月，杨进兴在亲手杀害罗世文、车耀先后，并用汽油、木柴烧尸灭迹。
    这个血债累累、罪大恶极的反革命杀人刽子手，解放以后化名潜逃农村，到四川南充市青居乡冒充“贫农”，企图长期潜伏起来，于1955年6月被公安部门逮捕归案。
