Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 15th. Eighty-four remains and sixty-four memorial tablets of anti-Japanese martyrs who were abducted to Japan by Japanese imperialism and died during the Anti-Japanese War were transported back to the motherland today by the Japanese ship "Hakusan Maru". The eighth group of the Chinese Martyrs' Remains Escort Delegation, headed by Sato Seiichiro, arrived in Tianjin New Port today.

A solemn ceremony was held at the Tianjin New Port wharf to welcome the remains and memorial tablets of the martyrs. The ceremony was attended by responsible persons from the Red Cross Society of China, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee, the Tianjin Red Cross Society, and representatives from all walks of life. Yang Zhenya, President of the Tianjin Red Cross Society, spoke at the ceremony, first expressing his deep condolences to these heroic martyrs who died. He said that we can tell the martyrs that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have long defeated Japanese imperialism, overthrown the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, have long recovered from the wounds of war, and are making rapid progress towards socialism. Yang Zhenya also said that we are willing to strengthen friendly relations with people of all countries, including the Japanese people, but the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan is acting against the wishes of the Japanese people and is determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people. Taking the remains of the martyrs returned today as an example, the Japanese government bears full responsibility for the Chinese people who were abducted during the war of aggression against China to engage in slavery and should conduct a thorough investigation and make specific explanations for the dead and missing. The Red Cross Society of China has also made requests a long time ago, but the Kishi Nobusuke government has not only failed to take measures, but on the contrary, after the recent discovery of compatriot Liu Lianren, even wanted to persecute him anew, which we absolutely cannot tolerate. We firmly demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government make a responsible account of all abducted Chinese people. He finally emphasized that we firmly believe that the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese peoples cannot be stopped by any force and will further develop forward.

Sato Seiichiro said in his speech that there are still thousands of martyrs' remains in various parts of Japan, and he expressed his intention to work hard to collect these remains and return them to China as soon as possible. He also expressed his intention to resolutely crush the war conspiracies that caused this disaster and to fight for peace and friendship.

    一批抗日烈士遗骨运到天津
    新华社天津15日电　在抗日战争时期被日本帝国主义掳劫到日本而殉难的抗日烈士遗骨八十四具和六十四个灵位，今天由日本轮船“白山丸”运回祖国。以团长佐藤清一郎为首的第八批中国殉难烈士遗骨护送团今天同时到达天津新港。
    在新港码头上举行了隆重的迎接烈士遗骨和灵位的仪式。参加仪式的有中国红十字会总会、天津市人民委员会和天津市红十字会负责人以及各界代表。天津红十字会会长杨振亚在举行仪式时讲话，他首先对这些英勇死难的烈士表示沉痛的哀悼。他说，我们可以告慰于先烈的是，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下早已击败了日本帝国主义，推翻了国民党的反动统治，早已恢复了战争创伤，正在向着社会主义突飞猛进。杨振亚又说，我们愿意和各国人民加强友好关系，包括日本人民在内，但是日本岸信介政府却违反日本人民的意愿，坚决与中国人民为敌。以今天送回的烈士遗骨来说，日本政府对于侵华战争期间掳去从事奴役的中国人民负有全部责任，应当彻底进行调查，对死亡的和下落不明的人作出具体交代，中国红十字会也早就提出过要求，但是岸信介政府非但没有采取措施，相反地最近难胞刘连仁被发现后，反而一度要对他进行新的迫害，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。我们坚决要求岸信介政府对所有被掳去的中国人作出负责交代。他最后强调指出，我们坚信中日两国人民的友好关系不是任何力量可以阻挡的，它将会进一步地向前发展。
    佐藤清一郎在讲话中说，日本各地还有几千的烈士遗骨，他表示将努力早日将这些遗骨收集起来送还中国。他还表示将坚决地粉碎引起这种祸害的战争阴谋，为坚持和平和友好而进行斗争。
