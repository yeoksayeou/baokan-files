　　Spring is in full bloom in Guangzhou these days. In the Guangzhou Uprising Martyrs Cemetery, ancient trees are sprouting and branching out, and the red flowers all over the ground are thriving. Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz and others laid a wreath in front of the martyrs' tomb. Afterwards, the distinguished guests visited the site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute hosted by Chairman Mao. Zhu Guang introduced the situation of the Chinese revolution at that time to Vice Chairman Jaroszewicz and others here. On the five-story building of Yuexiu Mountain, the distinguished guests overlooked the city of Guangzhou. Jaroszewicz was very interested in the people swimming in the Yuexiu Mountain swimming pool, because in Poland it is still a season when ice and snow have not melted. Subsequently, the distinguished guests also visited Huanghuagang and toured the city.

    雅罗谢维奇副主席在广州参观游览
    据新华社广州4日电　在广州访问的以雅罗谢维奇副主席为首的波兰政府代表团，今天在我国国家计划委员会副主任杨英杰和广州市长朱光的陪同下，参观了广州革命史迹和名胜地区。
    广州市这几天春意正浓，广州起义烈士陵园里，古树正在抽芽发枝，遍地的红花欣欣向荣。雅罗谢维奇副主席等在烈士陵前献了花圈。接着，贵宾们参观了毛主席主办的农民运动讲习所的旧址，朱光在这里向雅罗谢维奇副主席等介绍了当时中国革命的情况。在越秀山的五层楼上，贵宾们俯瞰了广州市的面貌。雅罗谢维奇对正在越秀山游泳池游泳的人们很感兴趣，因为在波兰目前还是冰雪未化的季节。随后，贵宾们还参观了黄花冈并游览了市容。
