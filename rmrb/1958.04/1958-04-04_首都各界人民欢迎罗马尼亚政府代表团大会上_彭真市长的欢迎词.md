Dear Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Chivu Stoica, dear comrades of the Romanian People's Republic Government Delegation, comrades, friends:
	In recent days, people from all walks of life in Beijing have long hoped to meet with Comrade Chivu Stoica and all the comrades of the Romanian People's Republic Government Delegation he leads. Today, at this cordial and friendly welcoming meeting, first of all, please allow me, on behalf of all the citizens of Beijing, to extend a warm welcome to Comrade Chivu Stoica and all the comrades of the delegation, and through you to express our high respect to the citizens of Bucharest and the entire Romanian people.
	Although China and Romania are thousands of miles apart, the relationship between our two countries is very close. The mutual understanding and friendship between our two peoples are deepening day by day. Here, I would like to mention in particular that at the beginning of last year, I and our National People's Congress delegation and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee delegation visited Romania. During the visit, we were warmly received by the Romanian people and leading comrades from all aspects of Romania. The deep friendship of the Romanian people for the Chinese people and their spirit of proletarian internationalism left us with a deep and unforgettable impression. During the visit, we saw with our own eyes the tremendous achievements made by the hardworking, brave, and intelligent Romanian people under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party and the government in socialist industry, agriculture, and in the construction of science and culture, and the continuous improvement of the people's living standards based on the development of production. At the same time, due to the continuous development of the national economy, Romania is playing an increasingly important role in international economic cooperation. China's economic construction has also received much assistance from Romania in equipment and technology. The Chinese people are very grateful for this brotherly assistance. At present, the Romanian people are working hard with full confidence to successfully complete and overfulfill the Second Five-Year Plan. The completion of this plan will further develop Romania's national economy and further improve the people's living standards. We sincerely wish the Romanian people continuous new and greater achievements in the cause of building their own country.
	Romania is a strong member of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. It has made great contributions to consolidating and strengthening the unity of socialist countries. Romania has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, and has made unremitting efforts to deepen mutual understanding between countries, maintain European and world peace, and strive for the relaxation of international tensions. Last September, the Romanian government's proposal to convene a high-level meeting of Balkan countries was welcomed by many countries and peace-loving people around the world. Our Chinese government fully supports this rational proposal that helps to maintain European and world peace. In addition, our two peoples, China and Romania, fully support the series of peace proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the recent period, and are actively striving to realize these major measures that help to ease international tensions. The Chinese people will unswervingly continue to work with the Romanian people to strive for the noble cause of maintaining world peace.
	A deep friendship has long existed between the people of China and Romania. Common communist ideals and common goals of struggle provide a solid foundation and infinitely broad prospects for the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries. In recent years, exchanges between our two peoples have become increasingly close, and cooperation between our two countries in economy, culture, and science and technology has also developed. The Chinese people, like the Romanian people, cherish this friendly and cooperative relationship that is conducive to the common upsurge of our socialist cause, and are willing to do everything possible to further develop this relationship. We ask Comrade Chivu Stoica and other comrades of the delegation to bring the deep friendship of our Chinese people to the fraternal Romanian people.
	Dear Comrade Chivu Stoica and all the comrades of the delegation, you are visiting our country at a time when our country is starting its Second Five-Year Plan. At present, all the Chinese people are realizing a great leap forward in our socialist reform and construction with unprecedented labor enthusiasm. However, our experience is still very insufficient, our technology is still relatively backward, and there are still many shortcomings in our work. We sincerely hope that during your visit, you will tell us your valuable experience in socialist construction, and give us criticism and correction of the shortcomings in our work. I am deeply convinced that your visit will make a significant contribution to the further development of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two peoples, to the consolidation and strengthening of the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and to the noble cause of maintaining world peace. Please allow me to once again express my warm welcome and high respect to you on behalf of the people from all walks of life in Beijing.
	Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples!
	Long live the unity of the great family of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
	Long live world peace! (Attached picture)

    首都各界人民欢迎罗马尼亚政府代表团大会上
    彭真市长的欢迎词亲爱的部长会议主席基伏·斯托伊卡同志，亲爱的罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团的全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    近几天来，我们北京市的各界人民早已渴望能够同基伏·斯托伊卡同志和他所率领的罗马尼亚人民共和国政府代表团的全体同志们会见。今天，在这个亲切和友好的欢迎大会上，首先，请允许我代表北京市的全体市民，向基伏·斯托伊卡同志和代表团的全体同志们表示热烈的欢迎，并且通过你们向布加勒斯特市民和罗马尼亚全体人民表示崇高的敬意。
    中罗两国虽然相距万里，我们两国的关系却是十分亲密的。我们两国人民之间的相互了解和友谊一天比一天加深。这里，我愿意特别提一下，去年年初我和我们全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团曾访问了罗马尼亚。在访问期间，我们到处受到了罗马尼亚人民和罗马尼亚各方面领导同志的热诚接待。罗马尼亚人民对于中国人民的深厚友情和他们的无产阶级国际主义的精神给我们留下深刻难忘的印象。在访问期间，我们亲眼看到勤劳、勇敢、聪明的罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党和政府的领导下，在社会主义工业、农业和在科学、文化的建设事业中所获得的巨大的成果和在生产发展基础上人民生活水平的不断提高。同时由于国民经济的不断发展，罗马尼亚在国际经济合作中起着越来越大的作用。我们中国的经济建设，也获得了罗马尼亚在装备和技术等方面的许多援助。中国人民对于这种兄弟的援助十分感谢。目前，罗马尼亚人民正在满怀信心地为顺利完成和超额完成第二个五年计划而努力。这一计划的完成将使罗马尼亚的国民经济得到进一步的发展，人民生活水平得到进一步的提高。我们衷心地预祝罗马尼亚人民在建设自己祖国的事业中，不断获得新的、更大的成就。
    罗马尼亚是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营中坚强的一员。它对巩固和加强社会主义各国的团结作出了巨大的贡献。罗马尼亚一贯执行着和平的对外政策，并且为加深各国之间的相互了解，为维护欧洲和世界和平和争取和缓国际紧张局势进行了不懈的努力。去年9月，罗马尼亚政府提出的关于召开巴尔干国家最高级会议的倡议获得了许多国家和全世界爱好和平的人民的欢迎。我们中国政府是完全支持这一有助于维护欧洲和世界和平的合理建议的。此外，我们中罗两国人民，完全支持最近一个时期以来苏联所提出来的一系列的和平建议，并且积极为争取实现这些有助于和缓国际紧张局势的重大措施而努力。中国人民将坚持不渝地继续同罗马尼亚人民一起为维护世界和平的崇高事业而奋斗。
    中罗两国人民间久已存在着深厚的友谊。共同的共产主义理想和共同的奋斗目标给我们两国之间的友好合作关系提供了巩固的基础和无限宽广的前途，近年来，我们两国人民之间的来往日益密切，我们两国之间的经济、文化和科学技术等方面的合作也日益发展。中国人民同罗马尼亚人民一样，十分珍视这种有利于我们社会主义事业共同高涨的友好合作关系，并且愿意竭尽全力为进一步发展这种关系而努力。我们请基伏·斯托伊卡同志和代表团的其他同志们把我们中国人民的深厚友谊带给兄弟的罗马尼亚人民。
    亲爱的基伏·斯托伊卡同志和代表团的全体同志们，你们是正当我国开始第二个五年计划的时候前来我国访问的。目前，我们全中国人民正以空前的劳动热情实现我国社会主义改革和建设事业的大跃进。但是我们的经验还很不够，我们的技术还比较落后，我们工作中的缺点还很多。我们衷心地希望你们在访问中，把你们的宝贵的社会主义建设经验告诉我们，并且对于我们工作中的缺点给予批评和指正。我深信，你们的这次访问定将为进一步发展我们两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和合作，为巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的伟大团结和维护世界和平的崇高事业作出重大的贡献。请允许我再一次代表北京市各界人民向你们表示热烈的欢迎和崇高的敬意。
    中罗两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国大家庭的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
