    Always Be the Most Lovable Person
    Demobilized soldier Zhang Yabiao lost both legs in the Battle of Shangganling during the Korean War. In the winter of 1953, he returned to his hometown, Huangling Village, Haicheng County, Fujian Province, and settled down with the care and attention of the government and villagers. Unwilling to rely on the disability pension and production assistance funds issued by the government, he began to practice walking on mountain roads with artificial legs. Later, he gradually persisted in land reclamation, cultivating more than eight mu of land in total, and further learned to plow. In 1956, he took the lead in joining the advanced cooperative, working like other members, unwilling to enjoy the preferential workdays given to him by the cooperative. His strong will and exemplary actions have been praised by the local masses. (Attached pictures)

    永远作最可爱的人
    复员军人张亚标在抗美援朝时的上甘岭战斗中负伤失去双腿。1953年冬他回到故乡福建省海澄县黄岭村，在政府和乡亲们的关怀和照顾下安居下来。他不愿依赖政府发给的残废抚恤金和生产资助金过活，开始用假腿练习走山路，以后逐渐坚持垦荒劳动，共开垦出八亩多地，又进一步学会了犁地。1956年他带头加入了高级社，和其他社员一样出工，不愿享受社里给他的优待劳动日。他的坚强意志和模范行动受到当地群众的称赞。（附图片）
