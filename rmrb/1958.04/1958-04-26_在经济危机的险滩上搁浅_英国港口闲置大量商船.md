Xinhua News Agency, London, April 25th: Due to the decline in economic activity in the capitalist world, an increasing number of merchant ships are lying idle in British ports.

On April 1st, a total of 218 merchant ships were idle in British ports, with a total tonnage of 1,132,454 tons (of which 156 ships, totaling 729,028 tons, were British ships). This is a new peak in the number of ships lying idle in British ports since the shipping slump began last December, and also represents the highest level of idle ships in British ports since the early 1930s. Compared to March 1st, the tonnage of idle ships increased by 164,799 tons, more than 1.7 times the figure for December 1st of last year (412,353 tons), and approximately thirty times the figure for April 1st of last year (approximately 36,000 tons).

    在经济危机的险滩上搁浅
    英国港口闲置大量商船
    据新华社伦敦25日电　由于资本主义世界经济活动衰退，英国各港口闲置不用的商船愈来愈多了。
    4月1日，在英国各港口闲置不用的商船共有二百一十八艘，总吨位一百一十三万二千四百五十四吨（其中一百五十六艘，七十二万九千零二十八吨是英国船）。这是自从去年12月航运业不景气开始以来在英国各港口闲置不用的船只数量的新的高峰，也是三十年代初期以来英国各港口闲置不用的船只数量所达到的最高水平。同3月1日相比较，闲置不用船只吨数增加了十六万四千七百九十九吨，比去年12月1日的数字（四十一万二千三百五十三吨）增加了一点七倍多，而为去年4月1日的数字（约三万六千吨）的三十倍左右。在瑞典、丹麦和西德，目前也有大量船只闲置不用。
