Xinhua News Agency News: The first group of personnel from the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe of Zhejiang Province has recently arrived in Beijing. This troupe is scheduled to give public performances at the Beijing Theater from the 19th, featuring Yue Opera and song and dance programs reflecting new people and new events in the Great Leap Forward.

The person in charge of the Yue Opera Troupe said that they came to Beijing to report on their achievements in the Great Leap Forward to the Ministry of Culture and the Beijing audience, and to conduct experiments in using Yue Opera to reflect real life. The Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe plans to perform more than ten new plays in Beijing this time, reflecting the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, such as "Uncontainable Girls," "A Thousand Li a Day," and "Ten Minutes," all of which were created during the Zhejiang Provincial Literary and Art Great Leap Forward Conference.

In addition to Yue Opera, the troupe will also perform small dramas reflecting real life, as well as folk songs and dances, and storytelling programs. This is also an attempt to implement the policy of small-scale and diverse forms, and to seek performance methods that are popular with workers and farmers.

The Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe has been touring the countryside for many years. They also retain many excellent traditional plays, such as "Shen Qing Zhuan," "Double Gui Tu," and "Fifteen Strings of Cash."

    杭州市越剧团来京演出
    反映大跃进的新越剧
    据新华社讯　浙江省杭州市越剧团第一批人员最近已经来到北京，这个剧团预定从19日起在北京剧场公演反映大跃进中新人新事的越剧和歌舞节目。
    这个越剧团负责人说，他们来北京是为了向文化部和北京观众汇报大跃进中的成绩，在用越剧反映现实生活方面进行实验。杭州市越剧团这次预定在北京演出的反映工农业生产大跃进的“关不住的姑娘”、“一日千里”、“十分钟”等十多个新剧目，都是在浙江省文艺大跃进会议期间创作出来的。
    越剧团这次除演出越剧外，还将演出反映现实生活的小型话剧以及民间歌舞和说唱等节目。这也是在贯彻小型多样的方针、寻求为工人农民观众喜欢的演出方式方面的一个尝试。
    杭州市越剧团几年以来长期在农村中巡回演出。他们还保留着许多优秀传统剧目，如“沈清传”、“双贵图”、“十五贯”等。
