People's University teachers are determined to cut out the tumor.

(Our dispatch) Whether to be a "scholar" who reaps both fame and fortune in the style of the bourgeoisie, or to be a people's teacher of the working class who is wholeheartedly dedicated? This is one of the important questions debated by teachers at Renmin University when deeply examining their teaching ideology. During the debates, teachers used discussion groups, heart-to-heart meetings, and big-character posters to thoroughly expose and criticize bourgeois individualism and the pursuit of fame and profit.

Some leading cadres in the Chinese Revolution History Teaching and Research Office openly stated: Studying Chinese history will definitely bring both fame and fortune. Some leading personnel were not conscientious and responsible enough for their administrative, social, and teaching work, but paid too much attention to writing books and manuscripts. Meng Zhenhu, director of the Trade Economics Teaching and Research Office, mentioned in his ideological self-criticism that he had only taught for one semester from 1955 to the present, and rarely paid attention to teaching content, plans, and other work, instead putting a lot of energy into writing articles and pamphlets in order to gain fame and profit. Zhu Cheng, a teacher in the Economic Geography Teaching and Research Office, repeatedly delayed the 30,000-word lecture note assignment given by the school, while engaging in about 600,000 words of foreign manuscript translation.

The result of the growth of the idea of fame and profit has brought serious harm to teaching. Many teachers only want to write manuscripts privately, are unwilling to participate in political movements, and do not pay attention to real-world struggles, which makes teaching divorced from reality. When the Trade Economics Teaching and Research Office compiled lecture notes, they emphasized publishing under individual names, which weakened the collective strength and reduced the quality of the lecture notes. Some teachers are unwilling to tutor students, fearing that it will take up their time. Some teachers in the Chinese History Teaching and Research Office felt that writing lecture notes did not bring as much income as writing for outside publications, and they shirked responsibility for compiling modern history lecture notes, which prevented the lecture notes from being completed on time and affected teaching. Some teachers in the Economic Geography Teaching and Research Office worked on translating foreign manuscripts until midnight, and then prepared lessons on the bus the next day. Some teachers even instilled the bourgeois idea of "writing articles can bring both fame and fortune" to students in the classroom.

Individual pursuit of fame and profit has also brought harm to scientific research work. The scientific research work of teachers should mainly serve teaching, but many teachers have placed scientific research in opposition to teaching. Meng Zhenhu, director of the Trade Economics Teaching and Research Office, said during his self-criticism that he used to think that as long as individual scientific research work was done well, teaching would not be a problem, so he had the idea of doing scientific research first and teaching later. Some teachers in the Political Economy Teaching and Research Office conducted "research work" behind closed doors and were unwilling to exchange opinions with each other. Students reflected that the small-scale peasant economy has been collectivized, but our teachers are still individual operators. Due to the influence of the idea of fame and profit, some teachers have adopted an unscientific attitude towards scientific research. A teacher in the Economic Geography Teaching and Research Office took credit for other people's labor when compiling "Economic Cartography." Xu Chang, a lecturer in the Trade Economics Department, confessed in a big-character poster that writing for outside publications was not for social needs, but started from the individual, in order to pursue a bourgeois lifestyle.

Although the teachers' mood was heavy during the self-criticism, they also tasted the joy of getting rid of their "burdens." Now, "facing teaching" and "everything for being both red and expert" have become their slogans of action. The Trade Economics and Economic Geography Teaching and Research Offices have decided to concentrate all their energy on compiling lecture notes well in the next six months, in addition to ensuring that they give good lectures. Meng Zhenhu, director of the Trade Economics Teaching and Research Office, has decided to lead this year's graduates to production internships, determined to find a set of experiences.

In order to distinguish right from wrong and prevent bias, school leaders pointed out that bourgeois individualism and the pursuit of fame and profit must be criticized, but scientific research work and publishing works must not be confused with simply pursuing individual fame and profit. Each teaching and research office is also preparing to conduct in-depth debates on specific topics in order to closely integrate teaching and scientific research and advance them simultaneously.

    人民大学教师决心割毒瘤
    本报讯　作资产阶级的名利双收的“学者”，还是作工人阶级的全心全意的人民教师？这是中国人民大学教师在深入检查教学思想时辩论的重要问题之一。辩论中，教师们通过座谈会、交心会、大字报，深入揭发和批判了资产阶级个人主义名利思想。
    中国革命史教研室有的领导干部公开讲过：研究中国史，一定会名利双收。有的领导人员对自己所担负的行政工作、社会工作和教学工作不够认真负责，而过多地注意自己写书写稿。贸易经济教研室主任孟振虎的思想检查谈到，他从1955年到现在，只担任过一学期的课，对教学内容、计划等工作，很少过问，把不少精力放在写文章、小册子上，以获取名利。经济地理教研室教师祝诚，对学校交给三万字的讲义任务一拖再拖，而搞外稿翻译约六十万字。
    名利思想滋长的结果，给教学带来了严重危害。不少教师只想私自写稿，不愿参加政治运动，不重视现实斗争，使教学脱离实际。贸易经济教研室编写讲义时，强调以个人名义出版，削弱了集体力量，使讲义质量降低。有些教师不愿给学生辅导，怕占用了自己的时间，中国历史教研室有些教师觉得写讲义没有写外稿收入大，对编写近代史讲义互相推诿，使讲义不能按时完成，影响了教学。经济地理教研室有的教师为译外稿工作到半夜，次日在交通车上备课。有的教师竟在课堂上向学生灌输“写文章能名利双收”的资产阶级思想。
    个人名利思想，给科学研究工作也带来了危害。教师的科学研究工作，应主要为教学服务，但不少教师把科学研究与教学对立起来。贸易经济教研室主任孟振虎检查时说，过去认为只要搞好个人的科学研究工作，教学就不成问题，因此有先搞科学研究，后搞教学的思想。政治经济教研室有的教师闭门进行“研究工作”，不愿互相交换意见。学生反映说，小农经济都合作化了，我们的老师还是单干户。由于名利思想作祟，有些教师对科学研究采取了非科学的态度。经济地理教研室有个教师在编译“经济制图学”时，将别人的劳动成果占为己有。贸易经济系讲师徐昶在大字报中检讨说，写外稿并不是为了社会需要，而是从个人出发，为了追求资产阶级生活方式。
    教师们在检查中尽管心情是沉重的，但也尝到丢掉“包袱”后的愉快。现在，“面向教学”，“一切为了红与专”已成为他们的行动口号。贸易经济与经济地理教研室决定，在这半年内除了保证讲好课外，集中全部精力编写好讲义。贸易经济教研室主任孟振虎决定带领这期毕业生下去生产实习，决心摸出一套经验。
    为了明辨是非，防止偏向，校领导指出，资产阶级个人主义名利思想必须批判，但绝不能把科学研究工作、发表著作与单纯追求个人名利混为一谈。各教研室也已准备分专题进行深入辩论，以便使教学与科学研究密切结合，齐头并进。
