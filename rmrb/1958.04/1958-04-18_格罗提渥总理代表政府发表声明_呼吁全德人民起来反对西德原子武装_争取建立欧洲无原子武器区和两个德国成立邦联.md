Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 16th: At the 34th plenary session of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, which opened at 10 a.m. today, Prime Minister Grotewohl issued an important statement on behalf of the government. He called on all German people to launch a broad, united, and powerful popular movement to take all measures to oppose West German atomic armament, strive to establish a European nuclear-weapon-free zone, and strive for the two Germanys to form a confederation. Grotewohl accused the reactionary majority in the Bonn Federal Parliament of passing an atomic armament resolution, calling it "the language of aggressors and atomic war politicians." He said that now the people must speak. "The voice of peace must drown out and stifle the cries of war." He pointed out that the power of the people is much greater than that of the warmongers.

Grotewohl then emphatically warned of the disastrous consequences that could arise once West German militarists gained control of atomic weapons, and he specifically appealed to the leaders of the West German Social Democratic Party, urging them not to forget the bitter lessons of history: whoever opposes understanding within the working class is helping the reactionary forces.

Grotewohl pointed out that the Adenauer government's current policy of atomic rearmament "will undoubtedly lead to the permanent division of Germany" because the peace-loving German Democratic Republic could never reunify with a West Germany equipped with atomic weapons. He warned that if the plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is rejected, the path to restoring German unity through the establishment of a confederation will be finally blocked.

Grotewohl said, "The solution to the German question is first and foremost a matter for the German people. If the two Germanys cannot reach an understanding beforehand, no international conference can achieve success on this issue." He said that the German Democratic Republic welcomes the Soviet proposal that representatives from the two Germanys participate in the highest-level meeting to discuss a peace treaty with Germany. He said that this does not mean signing separate peace treaties with the two Germanys, but rather drafting a single German peace treaty. He added that if the two Germanys hold negotiations on the issue of establishing a confederation, it will facilitate the creation of an all-German representative body. This body will have the right to sign the all-German peace treaty.

In his statement, Grotewohl warmly welcomed the Soviet decision to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing, considering it a "great and courageous act" taken to defend peace.

Grotewohl concluded by saying, "Capitalism means: crisis, war preparations, and atomic death, while socialism means: security, peace, and a happy life. Therefore, the decision of the German Democratic Republic is: to ease tensions, disarm, and promote peace."

After a heated discussion, the meeting passed a resolution expressing full support for the government's statement. The resolution called on all German people to unite more closely in the struggle against equipping the West German army with atomic weapons and against the resulting danger of atomic war. The resolution pointed out that the people of West Germany will receive the full support of the German Democratic Republic in their struggle.

The People's Chamber also passed an appeal to the parliaments of ten European countries – Belgium, Denmark, France, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia – urging them to do everything possible to prevent the implementation of the West German atomic armament resolution.

    格罗提渥总理代表政府发表声明
    呼吁全德人民起来反对西德原子武装
    争取建立欧洲无原子武器区和两个德国成立邦联
    据新华社柏林16日电　在今天上午十时开幕的民主德国人民议院第三十四次全体会议上，总理格罗提渥代表政府发表了重要声明。他呼吁全德人民掀起一个广泛团结的、强大的人民运动，来采取一切办法反对西德原子武装、争取建立欧洲无原子武器区和争取两个德国成立邦联。格罗提渥指责波恩联邦议院反动多数所通过的原子武装决议是“侵略者和原子战争政客的语言”。他说，现在人民必须发言。“和平的声音必须淹没和窒息战争的叫嚣。”他指出，人民的力量比战争贩子强大得多。
    格罗提渥接着就西德军国主义者一旦掌握原子武器后所可能产生的灾难性后果着重提出了警告，并且特别向西德社会民主党领导人发出呼吁，要他们不要忘记历史的惨痛教训：谁要是反对工人阶级内部的谅解，谁就是帮助了反动势力。
    格罗提渥指出，阿登纳政府现行的原子备战政策“无疑将造成德国分裂状态的永久化”，因为爱好和平的德意志民主共和国决不可能同装备了原子武器的西德重新统一。他警告说，如果在中欧建立无原子武器区的计划遭到拒绝，通过成立邦联来恢复德国统一的道路将被最后堵塞。
    格罗提渥说，“德国问题的解决首先是德国人民的事情。如果两个德国不能在事前达成谅解，任何国际会议都不可能在这个问题上获得成就。”他说，民主德国欢迎苏联关于由两个德国派代表参加最高级会议讨论对德和约问题的建议。他说，当然不是说同两个德国分别签订和约，而只能是起草一个全德和约。他又说，两个德国如果就建立邦联问题举行谈判，将可以促成全德代表机构的产生。这个机构将有权在全德和约上签字。
    格罗提渥在声明中热烈欢迎苏联关于单方面停止核武器试验的决定，认为这是为了保卫和平而采取的一桩“伟大而勇敢的行动”。
    格罗提渥最后说，“资本主义意味着：危机、战争准备和原子死亡，而社会主义则意味着：安全、和平和幸福生活。因此德意志民主共和国的决定是：缓和紧张局势、裁军与和平。”
    会议经过热烈讨论之后通过决议，表示完全支持政府的声明。决议号召全体德国人民在反对以原子武器装备西德军队和反对由此而产生的原子战争危险的斗争中更紧密地团结起来。决议指出，西德人民在斗争中将获得民主德国的全力支持。
    人民议院还通过了一项致比利时、丹麦、法国、英国、卢森堡、荷兰、挪威、奥地利、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克十个欧洲国家议会的呼吁书，要求它们尽一切努力，阻止西德原子武装决议的实现。
