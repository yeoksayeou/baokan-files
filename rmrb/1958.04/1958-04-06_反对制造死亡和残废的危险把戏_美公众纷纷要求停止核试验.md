Xinhua News Agency report: According to the New China News Agency, 500 participants in the "Walk for Peace" movement, who have arrived in New York, held a rally and demonstration in Times Square, New York, on the 5th to oppose nuclear weapons testing.

On the 4th, they submitted an appeal to the United Nations Headquarters, demanding a ban on nuclear weapons testing and seeking world disarmament.

This group of "Walk for Peace" participants walked to New York from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island, and other places in the United States, many of whom had been walking for five days. These people demonstrating against nuclear weapons testing include senior citizens in their sixties, children as young as ten, and many women. The signs they held high read: "Atomic weapons tests produce death and disability."

In recent days, the U.S. government's refusal to halt nuclear testing has continued to be criticized by the domestic public and media.

The "Congressional Quarterly" published a speech by Oregon Democratic Senator Morse delivered in the U.S. Senate on March 31, in which he called on the United States to stop testing nuclear weapons.

Morse said that the United States now has the possibility of "continuing to test nuclear weapons alone, regardless of international public opinion. I believe this is another sad example of our leaders' inability to understand and pay attention to the views of millions of people around the world, who are afraid of all nuclear explosions."

The "New York Post" published an article by Mrs. Roosevelt, in which she criticized the rigid U.S. policy of refusing to stop nuclear weapons testing. She believes that the Soviet Union's action of stopping nuclear testing is "an inevitable diplomatic victory and will enhance the Soviet Union's prestige in various countries around the world." Mrs. Roosevelt warned that the United States and Britain should bear full responsibility for the continued testing of nuclear weapons.

The "Atlanta Constitution" published an editorial saying that the Soviet Union's decision to stop nuclear testing has put the United States in an embarrassing situation. The United States no longer has any justification in the face of world public opinion. The newspaper's commentator believes that the Soviet Union's decision hit the United States even harder than its launch of the first artificial satellite. He said: "The Soviet Union declared a halt to nuclear weapons testing, while the United States is stepping up nuclear testing in the Pacific."

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" said in an editorial, "The Russians did something understandable and beneficial, and we did not."

The "New York World-Telegram and Sun," "Christian Science Monitor," and "Chicago Daily News" expressed skepticism in their editorials and reports from their Washington correspondents about Dulles' argument, which served as the basis for his entire position: that the Soviet Union's decision to stop nuclear weapons testing was "impossible to verify," and that the decision could be "covertly undermined." In this regard, the newspapers mentioned that it was none other than Eisenhower himself who, just a week ago at a press conference, expressed the completely opposite view, saying that at present, it is impossible to conceal even small atomic explosions.

### 反对制造死亡和残废的危险把戏  美公众纷纷要求停止核试验

    反对制造死亡和残废的危险把戏
    美公众纷纷要求停止核试验
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：已经到达纽约的五百名“为和平而奔走”运动的参加者，5日在纽约“时代广场”举行了反对试验核武器的集会和游行示威。
    他们在4日向联合国总部提出了一项呼吁书，要求禁止核武器试验和谋求世界裁军。
    这批“为和平而奔走”运动的参加者是从美国宾夕法尼亚、新泽西、康?狄格和长岛等地步行到纽约来的，其中许多人已经步行了五天。这些为反对核武器试验而举行长途示威的人民中包括有六十岁的老年人、十岁的小孩以及许多妇女。在他们高举的标语牌上写着：“原子武器试验产生死亡和残废”。
    连日以来，美国政府拒绝停止核试验的态度继续受到国内公众和舆论的抨击。
    美国“国会季刊”发表了俄勒冈州民主党参议员莫尔斯3月31日在美国参议院发表的演说，他呼吁美国停止试验核武器。
    莫尔斯说，现在美国有可能“不顾国际舆论继续单独地试验核武器。我认为，这又是一个可悲的例子，说明我国领导人不善于理解和注意世界千百万人民的观点，他们害怕一切核爆炸。”
    “纽约邮报”刊载了罗斯福夫人的文章，她抨击美国拒绝停止试验核武器的僵硬政策。她认为苏联停止核试验的行动是“一个必然的外交胜利，并且会提高苏联在世界各国的威信。”罗斯福夫人警告说，美国和英国应该对核武器的继续试验负全部责任。
    “亚特兰大宪法报”发表社论说，苏联停止核试验的决定使美国处于一个难堪的境地。美国在世界舆论面前再也没有任何辩解的理由了。这家报纸的评论员认为，苏联的决定给美国的打击比它发射第一颗人造卫星给美国的打击更强有力。他说：“苏联声明停止核武器试验，而美国却加紧在太平洋进行核试验。”
    “华盛顿邮报与时代先驱报”在社论中说，“俄国人做了可以理解的而且是有益的事情，而我们却没有做”。
    “纽约世界电讯与太阳报”、“基督教科学箴言报”和“芝加哥每日新闻”在它们的社论和驻华盛顿记者的报道中，表示怀疑杜勒斯那种作为他的整个立场的论据的说法：即苏联停止核武器试验的决定是否执行“无法检查”，这个决定可以“暗中破坏”。在这方面，报纸提到，不是别人，正是艾森豪威尔一个星期前还在记者招待会上表示过完全相反的看法，他说，在目前，要掩盖些许原子爆炸都是不可能的。
