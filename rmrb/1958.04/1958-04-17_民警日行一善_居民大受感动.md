    (Reported by this newspaper) Police officers at the Xiaxiejie Public Security Station in Xuanwu District, Beijing, strive to do a good deed for the people every day. For example, when pregnant woman Lin Yuying was about to give birth and lived far from the police station, police officer Jin Fang took the initiative to collect her cloth ration coupons and delivered them to her door. Housewife Wang Ruzhen had a temporary resident who moved out, but she was busy taking care of her four children and a sick person, and didn't have time to cancel the temporary residence registration. The police took the initiative to handle the procedures for her.
    Some police officers helped the masses with labor, establishing close relationships with them. Elderly Mrs. Li Xiangyun, who is over seventy years old, tells everyone about how police officer Wang Ruming carries water for her. There were several breaks in the electrical wiring at Gao Erying's home at No. 2 Kongque Hutong, which had remained unrepaired for a long time. This time, the police personally brought electrical tape to repair it for him, which greatly moved Gao Erying.

    民警日行一善　居民大受感动
    本报讯　北京市宣武区下斜街公安派出所的公安人员。争取每天给群众办一件好事。如孕妇林玉英将要临产，离派出所也远，民警靳芳就替她代领布票送上了门。家庭妇女王汝贞户内有一个暂住户口走了，她忙着要照顾四个孩子和一个病人，没空去注销暂住户口，民警就主动替她办了手续。
    有些民警帮助群众劳动，和群众建立了亲密的关系。七十多岁的李祥云老太太逢人便说民警王汝明替她提水的事。孔雀胡同二号高二营家的电线有几处破洞，长期未修。这次民警亲自带了胶布去替他修好，高二营很感动。
