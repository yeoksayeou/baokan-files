Building Bridges and Punting Boats to Cross the Yellow River and the Yangtze River
Wang Yinxi, Director of the Fengtai Branch of Xinhua Bookstore

The Fengtai District Branch is located in the suburbs of Beijing. After the suburban farmers experienced a great leap forward in agricultural production, the comrades unanimously proposed to fully support the great leap forward in agricultural production with our practical actions. How should we support it? To solve this problem, in mid-January of this year, we made a special investigation into the needs of rural areas. Throughout this investigation, we considered how to use books to help farmers increase production and solve production problems. We visited many departments and individuals such as the Rural Work Department's Agriculture and Forestry Section of the District Committee, the Agricultural Cooperative Technology Committee, and cadres sent to lower levels, which made us discover many problems. At the same time, we realized that rural distribution work can be very effective and have a great future in supporting agricultural production. For example, the main technical problems in vegetable cultivation in Fengtai District are: cabbage clubroot, tomato blossom-end rot, and spinach yellow leaf. Agricultural cooperatives reported that if there were solutions to these problems, they would be treasures. Some agricultural cooperatives reported that they are now formulating agricultural production plans, with high targets and great enthusiasm from the masses, but they lack experience in high-yield measures. They earnestly asked us: The bookstore needs any high-yield experience books on corn yielding 1,000 jin per mu, sweet potatoes yielding 10,000 jin per mu, potatoes yielding 10,000 jin per mu, and peanuts yielding 800 jin per mu. Many agricultural cooperatives lack knowledge of pig and rabbit raising, resulting in significant deaths and losses. When the District Committee informed us of the large-scale deaths of rabbits in the district, we were truly saddened. We thought at the time, could the bookstore use rabbit-raising books to help them solve this problem?

Our goals for the leap forward in rural distribution work were initially resolved ideologically after field investigation. After the investigation, we organized all the comrades in the branch to discuss how distribution work could support agriculture and help agricultural cooperatives solve key production problems. During the discussion, the comrades compared their own backwardness with the enthusiasm of the farmers, and saw the conservatism in rural book distribution from the rural investigation. Therefore, they put forward the resounding slogan of "building bridges and punting boats to cross the Yellow River and the Yangtze River," mustered revolutionary enthusiasm, and strived for excellence in rural distribution. First, we sorted out the books in the store and displayed them on a special counter in the branch, and reviewed and supplemented past orders. For example, the two books published by Hubei People's Publishing House introducing the experience of Macheng and Hongan in leading agricultural production originally had orders of ten copies each, or no orders at all. Now, we compile single-page promotional catalogs for these two books and solicit orders from various townships. In less than a week, four townships ordered 100 copies of each. With the approval of the District Committee, 300 copies of each book were distributed. We also launched a "book-finding" campaign. Comrade Jin Baoguo made a special trip to the urban science and technology branch to find "Pig Raising Science," and contacted the District Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station to order 40 copies. A pig farm was worried about swine fever and received this book as if it had found a treasure. When Huangtugang Township was formulating its 1958 plan, it requested the bookstore to supply books introducing high-yield experience. We used the Spring Festival holiday to collect books that met their needs. Zhangguozhuang Township also selected five types after hearing the news, ordering 100 copies of each. Currently, we are continuing to look for books, and have found solutions to cabbage clubroot and books on the experience of cabbage yielding 40,000 jin per mu from vegetable cultivation books, which have now been recommended to agricultural production cooperatives.

To serve agricultural production, we must distribute agricultural technology books well, and to distribute agricultural technology books well, we must master agricultural technical knowledge. Therefore, a upsurge of studying agricultural technology was immediately launched in the Fengtai Branch. We divided the study according to the different crops and livestock in the Fengtai area. The comrades proposed to work hard for three years to catch up with the level of agricultural technicians. From the rhymes compiled by the comrades, we can see their determination to study agricultural technical knowledge. Those studying vegetable knowledge said: "Compare rural distribution, see who can help farmers produce 60,000 jin of cabbage," "Do a good job in rural distribution, and we can definitely solve cabbage clubroot." The comrades studying field crops wrote: "Let's compete in rural distribution, see who can help farmers increase production of big sweet potatoes." The comrades studying animal husbandry also posted big-character posters saying: "Find good books all over the world to help farmers raise fat pigs." We also hired two comrades from the District Agricultural Technology Extension Station and the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Station as our book consultants, responsible for guiding our purchasing and sales of agricultural technology books. In addition, we also learned from the experience of planting experimental fields and selected two points as "experimental townships" for books to go to the countryside. The director of the District Branch personally participated in the experiment in order to gain experience from the experimental townships and guide the work.

Since then, all the comrades of the Fengtai District Branch have devoted themselves to this work, showing unparalleled dedication and energy. A comrade who specializes in serving government agencies runs to government agencies during the day and to the countryside at night. He said: "Go to the countryside, provide services, work hard for ten years without complaining." He also said: "Not afraid of freezing, not afraid of cold, the moon at night serves as a light."

The rural book distribution network is mainly based on supply and marketing cooperatives. To do a good job in rural book distribution, it is not enough to rely on branch stores to work alone. Yuegezhuang Central Store and Fanjiacun Central Store fired the first shot. They want to strive to be advanced units in rural book distribution in the whole district, and at the same time put forward the first proposal to promote rural book distribution work. At the meeting of central store managers held by the District Cooperative on February 25, the proposals of the two townships on the leap forward in book distribution work were forwarded to all central stores, and everyone was called upon to launch a large-scale competition for the leap forward in book distribution.

Now, the supply and marketing cooperatives have formulated a leap forward plan for book distribution in 1958, and have already begun promotional activities to promote books. Yuegezhuang and Fanjiacun stores have developed 35 volunteer distributors. After the reservation registration was established, eighteen readers registered books in one and a half days, including "Vegetable Cultivation Experience" needed by farmers, "Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" needed by teachers of people's schools, "Selected Songs from Shanghai Film Studio in 1957" needed by singing teams, and "Eugene Onegin" needed by cadres (writers) sent to lower levels. A total of sixteen types of books were needed and resolved, which won praise from readers. Li Baoxin, accountant of the Red October Agricultural Cooperative, praised them and said, "Your work is really good, you solve problems really quickly, and I got the book I registered the next day." After Fanjiacun Township Party Secretary bought a copy of "How Macheng Became a County with 100 Jin of Ginned Cotton per Mu," he said happily, "If you hadn't promoted and introduced it, I would never have found such a good way to lead production experience."

    为跨黄河过长江架桥撑船
    新华书店丰台门市部主任　王印西
    丰台区门市部是在北京郊区。当郊区农民在农业生产上出现了大跃进的形势以后，同志们一致提出要用我们的实际行动来全力支援农业生产大跃进。应当怎样支援呢？为了解决这个问题，今年1月中旬，我们特意对农村的需要情况作了一次调查。这次调查，我们自始至终考虑的是，如何让书籍帮助农民增产，帮助农民解决生产上的难题。我们访问了区委农村工作部农林科、农业社技术委员会、下放干部等等许多部门和个人，使我们发现了很多问题，同时也认识到农村发行工作对于支援农业生产可以大有作为，大有前途。例如，当前在丰台区蔬菜栽培上的主要技术问题是：白菜烂疙瘩，西红柿烂顶，菠菜黄叶。农业社反映，如果有解决这些问题的办法，那真成为宝贝了。有些农业社反映，现在正在订农业生产规划，指标订得很高，群众劲头也很大，但就是缺乏丰产经验方面的措施。他们殷切地向我们提出：书店凡是有玉米亩产一千斤、白薯亩产一万斤、马铃薯亩产一万斤、花生亩产八百斤的丰产经验书籍，他们都需要。不少农业社缺乏养猪养兔的知识，死亡损失很大。当区委向我们介绍全区的兔子大批大批死亡的情况时，我们真是难过极了。我们当时就想，书店能不能用养兔的书籍来帮助他们解决这个问题呢？
    我们对农村发行工作的跃进目标，经过实地调查，在思想上初步得到了解决。调查以后，我们组织门市部全体同志对于发行工作如何支援农业帮助农业社解决生产上的关键问题进行了讨论。在讨论中，同志们从农民的干劲中比出了自己的落后，从农村调查里看到了农村图书发行上的保守。因此，提出了“为跨黄河过长江架桥撑船”的响亮口号，鼓足了革命干劲，要在农村发行上力争上游。首先我们把店里的书排了队，并在门市部陈列了专台，对过去的订货作了检查和补课。如湖北人民出版社出版的介绍麻城和红安领导农业生产经验的两种书，原来一种订十本，一种未订。现在把这两本书编写单页宣传目录，向各乡征订，不到一周，四个乡就每种订一百册，经区委同意两书各发三百册。我们又发起了一个“找书”运动，金保国同志特意赶到城区科技门市部找“养猪学”，经与区畜牧兽医站联系订出四十册。一个养猪场正为猪瘟发愁，得到这本书如获至宝。黄土岗乡订1958年规划时，要求书店供应介绍丰产经验的书籍。我们利用春节假期搜集到了适合他们需要的书。张郭庄乡听到这个消息后，也挑选了五种，每种订购一百册。目前我们还在继续找书，已经从蔬菜栽培学一类书中找到解决白菜烂疙瘩的办法和白菜亩产四万斤经验的书，现已向农业生产合作社推荐。
    要为农业生产服务必须发好农业技术书籍，而要发好农业技术书籍又必须掌握农业技术知识。因此，在丰台门市部立即展开了钻研农业技术的热潮。我们按照丰台地区的不同作物和畜种在学习上作了分工。同志们提出要勤钻苦干三年，赶上农业技术员的水平。从同志们编的顺口溜里，可以看到他们在钻研农业技术知识上的决心。钻研蔬菜知识的说：“农村发行比比看，看谁能帮农民白菜产六万”，“农村发行作到家，定能解决白菜烂疙瘩”。钻研农田作物的同志写道：“农村发行来比比武，看谁能帮农民增产大白薯”。学习畜牧知识的同志也贴出大字报说：“普天之下找好书，帮助农民养肥猪”。我们还聘请了区农业技术推广站和畜牧兽医站的两位同志作我们的书籍顾问，负责指导我们农业技术书籍的进销货工作。此外，我们又学习了种试验田的经验，选择了两个点作书籍下乡的“实验乡”。区门市部主任亲自动手参加实验，以便从实验乡里摸索经验，指导工作。
    从此，丰台区门市部全体同志投入了这个工作，表现了无比的钻劲和干劲。一个专门搞机关服务工作的同志白天跑机关，晚上还跑农村。他说：“下农村，跑服务，苦干十年不说苦”。还说：“不怕冻，不怕冷，夜间月亮当电灯。”
    农村图书发行网是以供销社为主体的。要做好农村图书发行工作，光靠分店单干是不行的。岳各庄中心商店和樊家村中心商店打响了第一炮。他们要争取作全区农村图书发行的先进单位，同时提出了促进农村图书发行工作的第一份倡议书。区社在2月25日召开的中心商店经理会上，将两个乡关于图书发行工作跃进的倡议书转发给各中心商店，并号召大家开展一个图书发行跃进大竞赛。
    现在，供销合作社已经订出了1958年图书发行的跃进计划，并且已经开始了推销书籍的宣传活动。岳各庄、樊家村两个商店已经发展了义务发行员三十五个。预约登记建立起来后，一天半内就有十八个读者登记书，其中有农民需要的“蔬菜栽培经验”，民校教师需要的“汉语拼音方案”，歌咏队需要的“1957年上影歌曲选”，下放干部（作家）需要的“欧根·奥?金”等书。前后共解决了十六种书的需要，获得了读者好评。红十月农业社会计李保莘表扬他们说“你们工作真好，解决问题真快，我登记的书，第二天就拿到了。”樊家村乡党委书记买到一本“麻城是怎样成为皮棉百斤县的”以后，高兴地说：“要不是你们宣传介绍，我怎么也不会找到这样好的领导生产经验办法。”
