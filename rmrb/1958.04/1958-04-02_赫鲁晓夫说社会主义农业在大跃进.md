Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 1st: According to TASS, Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, made a concluding speech on March 31st at a joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the discussion about further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations. He said that the representatives unanimously approved the proposed measures, and some specific opinions and hopes raised by the representatives would be considered in the relevant laws and relevant resolutions of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

When talking about selling technical equipment to medium and backward collective farms, Khrushchev said that it is appropriate to sell the technical equipment to medium collective farms on installments within two to three years, with a maximum of no more than five years. When talking about economically weak collective farms, Khrushchev said that lagging collective farms must be strengthened with outstanding and experienced leaders so that these collective farms can increase their output and ensure that they reach a higher economic level after one to two years.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union is confidently advancing along the path indicated by Lenin, the path of communism. Socialist industry is booming. Socialist agriculture is making a great leap forward. Soviet science and culture have achieved remarkable achievements.

Khrushchev pointed out that the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union is one of the most powerful sources of strength in the struggle for the victory of communism. The Soviet Union, together with the great People's Republic of China and all the peoples of the socialist countries, is at the forefront of the struggle for peace and for freeing mankind from the threat of a new war.

Khrushchev finally emphasized once again that the law on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations is an important step in realizing the great plan of communist construction. He also pointed out in his speech that this issue involves many aspects of life. He suggested that the Soviet State Planning Committee and relevant departments study all these issues and submit the necessary recommendations to the government for study.

    赫鲁晓夫说社会主义农业在大跃进
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席、苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫3月31日在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上就关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站问题的讨论作结束发言。他说，代表们一致赞同拟定的各项措施，代表们提出的一些具体意见和希望将在有关的法律中和苏共中央和苏联部长会议的有关决议中加以考虑。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到向中等的和落后的集体农庄出售技术设备问题时说，对卖给中等集体农庄的技术设备在两三年内、最多不超过五年分期付款的办法是适宜的。赫鲁晓夫在谈到经济薄弱的集体农庄时说，必须用优秀的、有经验的领导者来加强落后的集体农庄，使这些集体农庄在经过一年到两年以后能够提高它们的产量，保证它们在经济上达到更高的水平。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联满怀信心地沿着列宁所指示的道路、共产主义道路前进。社会主义工业正在蓬勃地发展。社会主义农业正在大跃进中。苏联的科学和文化取得了卓越的成就。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联各族人民的友谊是争取共产主义胜利的斗争中最雄厚的力量源泉之一。苏联同伟大的中华人民共和国，同各社会主义国家的全体人民一道，走在争取和平、争取使人类摆脱新战争的威胁的斗争的前列。
    赫鲁晓夫最后再一次强调指出，进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的法律是实现共产主义建设伟大计划的一个重要步骤。他在发言中还指出，这个问题涉及生活的许多方面。他建议苏联国家计划委员会和有关的部对所有这些问题进行研究，并且把必要的建议提交政府研究。
