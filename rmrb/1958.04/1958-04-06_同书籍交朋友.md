    Making Friends with Books
    Huang Biyun
    Books are a powerful tool for every parent to educate their children. Many parents give colorful books as gifts to their children. However, how can children correctly understand the content of books, influence their thoughts and feelings, and allow young children to be nourished by books? Young children are illiterate and cannot read independently. Although they have many books, they cannot be interested. Therefore, specific guidance and help with children's reading is an indispensable part of family education.
    After buying a new book, parents should read it first. After understanding the content of the book and grasping the main points of the work, then tell or read it to the children. Let the children look at the illustrations and follow along with the rhythmic words and sentences in the book. During reading, you can also strengthen children's understanding and experience of the book's content through questions and answers and conversations.
    Don't underestimate children's age; they are rich in emotion, have strong perception, and are highly imitative. Guiding children's reading is different from lecturing students. When reading stories to them, one must appropriately change tone and expression according to the plot of the story and the characters' behavior; to convey the ideological content of the work to the children vividly. Parents must show a strong interest and affection for these readings in order to effectively arouse resonance in the child's young mind, inspire them to pursue the beautiful ideals in the book, and imitate the good behavior of the protagonists in the book. When telling a three- or four-year-old child about three butterflies flying in the rain and being repeatedly rejected by the red, yellow, and white flowers, who refuse to let the three friends shelter from the rain together, they resolutely say: "We three good friends, loving each other and never parting, come together and go together." As you speak, the tone is modulated, not only increasing the child's interest, but also strengthening the child's understanding of the three butterflies' friendship. In the future, the child will reflect this feeling of friendship in life and games, promoting the formation of the child's moral character.
    When guiding children's reading, you can ask questions and talk to them based on their reactions after listening, such as asking them: "Do you like these three butterflies?" "Why do you like them?" "Why don't they want to separate?" and so on. Use these questions to inspire children to think about the content of the book and develop their intelligence. For slightly older children, after reading aloud, you may want to let the children judge for themselves what is good and what is not good, and instill the spirit of the work into the child's consciousness through enlightening questions and answers and conversations. As for the requirements for older children, they can be even higher, such as asking them to retell the story to see if it is complete and correct, and through retelling, to exercise their ability to express thoughts and enrich their imagination and observation.
    Reciting short nursery rhymes and beautiful poems is also an easy-to-remember method that children are happy to accept. Parents can first show the children the illustrations, explain them, and help them understand the content of the poem, and then teach the children to read sentence by sentence, and then read it coherently. After teaching the child to read it several times like this, the child will read and recite it himself. Although they do not recognize those words, their memory is very strong, and they can often recite very long poems, even entire stories.
    Correctly guiding children's home reading will bring great joy to children, make them love books, regard books as good friends, and learn a lot of knowledge from this good friend.

    同书籍交朋友
    黄碧云
    书籍，是每个父母用来教育孩子的有力工具。许多家长都把五光十色的图书当作礼物送给孩子们。但是，怎样才能使孩子正确地理解书的内容，影响他们的思想感情，使年幼的孩子从书籍中得到滋养呢？小孩子不识字，自己不能独立阅读，虽然有不少图书，但不能引起兴趣。因此，对孩子的阅读进行具体的指导和帮助，是家庭教育中不可缺少的。
    买来一本新书，父母要先看一遍。了解了书的内容，掌握了作品的要点以后，再给孩子讲述或朗读。让孩子们看着插图，跟着念书中那些有韵律的词句。在阅读中，还可以通过问答、交谈，来加强孩子对书籍内容的了解和体会。
    别看孩子年龄小，他们可富有情感，感受力强，模仿性大。指导孩子阅读，和对学生们讲课不同。给他们朗读书中的故事就不能不随着故事的情节、人物的行为，适当地变换语气和表情；有形有色地把作品的思想内容传达给孩子。父母要表现出对这些读物有浓厚的兴趣和感情，才能有效地引起孩子幼小心灵的共鸣，激发他们追求书中那些美好的理想，模仿书中主人翁的良好行为。给三、四岁的孩子讲述三只蝴蝶在雨中飞来飞去，接连遭到红花、黄花、白花的拒绝，不让她们三个朋友在一块儿避雨，她们毅然决然地说：“我们三个好朋友，相亲相爱不分手，要来一块儿来，要走一块儿走。”讲着，讲着，声音抑扬顿挫，不但增加孩子的兴趣，也加强孩子对三只蝴蝶的友爱的体会。日后孩子在生活和游戏中就会反映出这种友爱的感情，促进了孩子道德品质的形成。
    在指导儿童阅读时，可以根据儿童听后的反映，提出问题和他谈话，如问他们：“你喜欢这三只蝴蝶吗？”“为什么喜欢她们呢？”“她们为什么不愿意分开呢？”等等。用这些问话启发孩子去思索书中的内容，发展了孩子的智力。对稍大一点的孩子，在朗读之后，不妨让孩子自己评判什么是好，什么是不好，把作品中的精神通过启发性的问答和交谈，灌输到孩子意识中去。至于对较大的孩子的要求就更可以高一些，如让他们重讲一遍，看是否讲得完整、正确，通过讲述来锻炼他们表达思想、丰富自己的想像和观察的能力。
    背诵简短的儿歌和优美的诗歌，也是孩子乐于接受，而又容易记忆的办法。父母可以先给孩子看插图，一面讲解，帮助他理解诗歌的内容，然后教给孩子一句一句念，以后就连贯着念。这样教孩子念几遍之后，孩子就会自己念，自己背了。尽管他们不认识那些字，但他们的记忆力非常强，他们常常能背诵很长的诗，甚至整本的故事。
    正确地指导孩子的家庭阅读，会给孩子带来极大的快乐，使他们喜爱书籍，把书籍作为好朋友，从这位好朋友那里学到许多知识。
