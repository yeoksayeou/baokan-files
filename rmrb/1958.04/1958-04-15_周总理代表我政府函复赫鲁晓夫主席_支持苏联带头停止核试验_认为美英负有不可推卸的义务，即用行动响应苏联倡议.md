Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, N.S. Khrushchev, wrote to Premier Zhou Enlai of our State Council on April 4th regarding the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Premier Zhou Enlai replied to Chairman Khrushchev on the 13th, expressing full support for the Soviet government's decision and the Soviet government's proposal to the US and UK governments on this issue. Premier Zhou Enlai's reply and Chairman Khrushchev's letter are as follows:

Premier Zhou Enlai's Reply:

To Comrade N.S. Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,

Respected Chairman Comrade,

I have received your letter of April 4, 1958. I am very pleased to inform you that the Chinese government fully supports the Soviet government's decision, effective March 31, 1958, to be the first to cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the Soviet government's proposal to the US and UK governments on this issue.

The immediate and complete cessation of testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons has become the urgent demand of hundreds of millions of people in all countries of the world today. The Soviet government's decision to take the lead in halting nuclear weapons testing fully conforms to the ardent wishes of the people of all countries. This action by the Soviet government powerfully demonstrates its consistent stance of upholding peace and fully expresses the Soviet people's deep concern for the peace and happiness of the people of all countries. It also greatly encourages the confidence of all peace-loving countries and peoples in striving for peace. Without a doubt, this is an extremely great contribution to maintaining world peace and promoting human happiness. The Chinese people warmly welcome this great peaceful action by the Soviet Union.

The Soviet government's decision has made a practical start towards a universal cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing, taking the first step in freeing humanity from the threat of a devastating atomic war. Now, all peace-loving countries and peoples around the world are urgently demanding and expecting the United States and Britain to take the same measures as the Soviet Union. The Chinese government believes that the United States and Britain, possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons, have an unshirkable obligation to the peace-aspiring people of the world to respond to the Soviet initiative with practical actions, making the universal cessation of nuclear weapons testing possible; otherwise, they will never escape the just condemnation of the people of the world and the grave responsibility of harming humanity.

It is the people who decide the fate of the world. We believe that as long as the people of the world unite closely and fight resolutely to defend peace, the cause of peace will surely triumph.

Please accept my sincere respect.

Zhou Enlai
Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
April 13, 1958, in Beijing

Chairman Khrushchev's Letter:

To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China,

Respected Premier Comrade:

One of the most pressing issues in current international relations that is of particular and profound concern to millions upon millions of people in all countries of the world is the need to immediately cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The deep unease felt by all strata of the population, from political activists and expert scholars to ordinary people, general urban and rural workers, and mothers, regarding the ongoing nuclear weapons test explosions is easily understood. This is because these tests exacerbate the arms race, promote the research of new, more destructive and lethal nuclear weapons, thereby increasingly deepening the threat of atomic war facing humanity.

Not only that, but the frequent experimental explosions of atomic and hydrogen weapons are already harming the health of innocent and peaceful residents of various countries in peacetime. The appeal to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, signed this January by 9,235 scholars from forty-four countries, pointed out that each nuclear bomb test increases radioactive dust, thereby harming the health of people around the world and threatening the normal development of future generations.

The Soviet government has therefore concluded that the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests can no longer be delayed, because it is unacceptable for people's health to suffer irreparable damage.

Currently, only three countries, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, possess nuclear weapons, so it is relatively easy to reach an agreement on stopping nuclear weapons tests. If testing is not stopped now, after some time, other countries will also possess nuclear weapons, and in this case, it will naturally be more complicated to reach an agreement on stopping testing.

Over the past three years, the Soviet government has repeatedly suggested to the US and British governments that they stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. Because the US government and the British government are unwilling to indefinitely halt nuclear testing, the Soviet side has suggested that they stop such testing, even if only for a certain period, such as two or three years. The Soviet Union's proposal on this issue stipulates the establishment of the necessary international supervision over the cessation of testing.

Despite all these efforts, it is regrettable that no agreement has been reached to date on unconditionally and immediately ceasing nuclear testing, or even temporarily ceasing it.

In order to open a practical beginning for the universal cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons testing, thereby taking the first step in completely freeing mankind from the threat of a devastating atomic war, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided that the Soviet Union would cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The Soviet government, in implementing the decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, has adopted a decision to unilaterally cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons, effective March 31, 1958.

The Soviet government suggests that the US and British governments participate in this step. For the common good of all mankind, the Soviet government calls upon the government of the People's Republic of China to support this initiative.

If the governments of the countries that currently possess nuclear weapons support the Soviet Union's proposal and make a decision to no longer conduct tests, then this issue, which the people of the world deeply care about, will finally be resolved, thereby taking a major step forward in building genuine trust between countries and consolidating peace.

However, if the governments of the countries that possess nuclear weapons are unwilling to respond to the Soviet government's decision and prefer to continue conducting atomic and hydrogen weapons tests as before, then, in this case, the Soviet Union, in order to ensure its own security, will naturally have no other choice but to consider itself no longer bound by its commitment to cease nuclear testing. However, the Soviet government does not want this situation to arise.

In its appeal to the US and British governments, the Soviet government expressed its hope that the governments of these countries would participate in the Soviet initiative, thereby making the permanent and universal cessation of nuclear weapons testing possible.

This practical step to free people from the threat of modern nuclear weapons will greatly promote the task of all peoples to completely eliminate the threat of atomic war. Few would deny that stopping atomic and hydrogen weapons testing would undoubtedly greatly improve the entire international political atmosphere and create more favorable conditions for resolving other outstanding international issues.

Premier Comrade, I hope that the above-mentioned proposal of the Soviet government will be positively received by the government of the People's Republic of China.

With sincere respect,

N. Khrushchev
April 4, 1958

    周总理代表我政府函复赫鲁晓夫主席
    支持苏联带头停止核试验
    认为美英负有不可推卸的义务，即用行动响应苏联倡议
    新华社14日讯　苏联部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫4月4日就苏联单方面停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器问题写信给我国国务院总理周恩来。周恩来总理在13日复信给赫鲁晓夫主席，表示完全支持苏联政府的决定和苏联政府就这一问题向美英两国政府提出的建议。周恩来总理的复信和赫鲁晓夫主席的来信如下：
    周恩来总理的复信苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志，敬爱的主席同志：
    我已经收到你1958年4月4日的来信。我很高兴地通知你，中国政府完全支持苏联政府自1958年3月31日起，首先停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器的决定和苏联政府就这一问题向美英两国政府提出的建议。
    立即完全停止试验各种类型的原子武器和氢武器，已经成为当前世界各国亿万人民的迫切要求。苏联政府带头首先停止试验核武器的决定，完全符合于世界各国人民的这一殷切愿望。苏联政府的这一行动，有力地证明了苏联政府一贯维护和平的立场，充分地表现出苏联人民对世界各国人民的安宁和幸福的深切关怀；并且大大地鼓舞了一切爱好和平的国家和人民争取和平的信心。毫无疑问，这对维护世界和平和增进人类幸福是一个极其巨大的贡献。中国人民热烈地欢迎苏联这一伟大的和平行动。
    苏联政府的决定为普遍停止试验原子武器和氢武器作出了一个实际的开端，在使人类免除毁灭性的原子战争的威胁方面迈出了第一步。现在，全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民都在迫切地要求和期待美英两国采取和苏联同样的措施。中国政府认为，拥有原子武器和氢武器的美英两国，在渴望和平的世界人民面前，负有不可推卸的义务，即用实际行动来响应苏联的倡议，使普遍停止试验核武器成为可能；否则，他们将永远不能逃脱世界人民的正义谴责和戕害人类的严重责任。
    决定世界命运的是人民。我们相信，只要全世界人民紧密地团结起来，坚强地为保卫和平而奋斗，和平的事业是一定要胜利的。
    谨致诚挚的敬意。
                          中华人民共和国国务院总理　周恩来
                                一九五八年四月十三日于北京
     赫鲁晓夫主席的来信中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来同志敬爱的总理同志：
    当前国际关系中使世界各国千百万人特别深切关怀的和最迫切的问题之一，就是必须立即停止试验各种类型的原子武器和氢武器。各阶层居民，从政治活动家和专家学者到普通人，一般城乡劳动者和母亲们对不断进行的核武器试验性爆炸所感到的深切不安是容易理解的。因为这些试验加剧着军备竞赛，促进研究新的、破坏性和杀伤力更大的核武器，从而日益加深人类所面临的原子战争的威胁。
    不但如此，经常进行原子武器和氢武器的试验性爆炸在目前和平时期就已经损害着各国善良无辜的和平居民的健康。今年1月由四十四个国家的九千二百三十五名学者签名的致联合国秘书长的呼吁书中指出，每一次的核炸弹试验都增加放射性微尘，从而损害着全世界人们的健康，并威胁着后代的正常发育。
    苏联政府据此得出的结论是：停止核武器试验的问题不能再迟延不决了，因为不能容许人们的健康遭到不可挽救的损害。
    现在，还只有苏联、美国和英国三个国家拥有核武器，所以比较容易就停止核武器的试验达成协议。如果现在不停止试验，再过若干时候，其他国家也会拥有核武器，在这种情况下，要达成停止试验的协议自然就更复杂了。
    最近三年来，苏联政府不止一次地向美国和英国政府建议停止试验原子武器和氢武器。由于美国政府以及英国政府不愿意无限期地停止核试验，苏联方面又建议开头那怕只在一定期限内，比如在两、三年内停止这种试验。苏联有关这一问题的建议规定对停止试验建立必要的国际监督。
    尽管作了这一切努力，遗憾的是，在解决无条件立即停止核试验方面，甚至是暂时停止方面，迄今都未能达成协议。
    苏联最高苏维埃为了给普遍停止试验原子武器和氢武器打开实际开端，从而在使人类彻底免除毁灭性的原子战争威胁方面迈出第一步，决定苏联停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器。
    苏联政府执行苏联最高苏维埃的决议，通过了自1958年3月31日起单方面停止试验一切类型的原子武器和氢武器的决定。
    苏联政府建议美国和英国政府参与这一步骤。为了全人类的共同利益苏联政府呼吁中华人民共和国政府支持这一倡议。
    如果目前拥有核武器的国家的政府支持苏联的这一建议，并且作出不再进行试验的决定，那么，全世界人民深切关怀的这个问题就会终于得到解决，从而在建立各国之间的真正信任和巩固和平方面前进一大步。
    但是，如果拥有核武器的国家的政府不愿意响应苏联政府的这个决定而宁肯一切照旧，继续进行原子武器和氢武器试验，那么，在这种情况下，苏联为了保障自己的安全，自然别无出路，只能认为自己不再受所承担的关于停止核试验的约束。然而苏联政府不希望出现这种局面。
    苏联政府在致美国和英国政府的呼吁书中，表示希望这些国家的政府参与苏联的倡议，从而使永久普遍停止试验核武器成为可能。
    使人们免除现代核武器灾害威胁的这一实际步骤，将在很大程度上促进各国人民解决完全摆脱原子战争威胁这一任务。未必有人会否认：停止试验原子武器和氢武器无疑将大大改善整个国际政治空气并且为解决其他悬而未决的国际问题创造更有利的条件。
    总理同志，我希望苏联政府的上述建议会得到中华人民共和国政府的积极对待。
    致以真诚的敬意。
                    尼·赫鲁晓夫
                一九五八年四月四日
