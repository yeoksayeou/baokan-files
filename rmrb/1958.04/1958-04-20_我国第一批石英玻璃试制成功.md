Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th. The Central Laboratory of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company has recently successfully trial-produced China's first batch of quartz glass. After inspection and on-site use, the quality has been proven to be the same as imported goods. This is a major new achievement in China's refractory material industry.
    Quartz glass is one of the world's advanced refractory materials and is urgently needed by many industrial sectors in China. Unlike ordinary glass, it can withstand high temperatures, high voltages, and high frequencies, and has a very small expansion coefficient. Even when heated to near 2,000 degrees Celsius, it does not melt, and it does not crack when immediately immersed in cold water. It is not only an indispensable item in modern metallurgical industry, but can also be made into high-temperature and acid-resistant utensils for the chemical industry, and is also an important material for the medical equipment industry to manufacture sun lamps.

    我国第一批石英玻璃试制成功
    新华社上海19日电　上海钢铁公司中心试验室最近试制成功了我国第一批石英玻璃。经过检验和现场使用，证明质量和进口货一样。这是我国耐火材料工业上的一项重大新成就。
    石英玻璃是目前世界上高级耐火材料中的一种，国内许多工业部门都迫切需要。它不同于一般玻璃，能耐高温、高电压和高频率，而且膨胀系数很小。即使把它加热到接近摄氏二千度也不熔化，又立即投入冷水中也不炸裂。它既是现代冶金工业不可缺少的物品，也可以作成化学工业上用的耐高温、耐酸的器皿，同时又是医疗器械工业制造太阳灯的重要材料。
