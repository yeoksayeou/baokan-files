Hundred-Character Poem
Sending Youth to the Countryside and Factories
Qian Changzhao

The landscape is like a painting, with young people in teams, setting off lightly on a long journey. Familiar with operating the pestle and sickle, even more, learning the language of workers and peasants. A new generation, inheriting and creating, must strive to be a model. Always aspiring to be worthy, outstanding sons and daughters of China.

The waves of eight years of construction, closely following one after another, a billion people sing and dance together. The tradition of bravery and diligence is good, and awareness has reached a new height. Loving the country with one heart, a journey of ten thousand miles, a happy and bright road. Leaping forward in flight, the scene surpasses the ancient and modern.

    百字令
    送青年下乡进厂
    钱昌照
    江山如画，有青年结队，轻装远去。熟习椎镰操作事，更向工农学语。一代新生，继承创造，模范须争取。总期无愧，中华优秀儿女。
    八载建设浪潮，后先紧接，亿众同歌舞。勇敢勤劳传统好，觉悟又臻高度。爱国一心，征程万里，幸福光明路。飞腾跃进，气象超越今古。
