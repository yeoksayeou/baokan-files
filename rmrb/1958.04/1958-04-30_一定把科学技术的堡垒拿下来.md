We Must Take Down the Bastion of Science and Technology
Wang Pu

After reading the news about the leading cadres of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant transforming from laymen into experts, I was reminded of a saying by the great revolutionary teacher Lenin: "As long as you are willing to learn, you will definitely be able to learn." Isn't that right? Comrade Ma Chengzhai, the deputy director of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, couldn't even distinguish between steel and iron when he first arrived at the plant. Now, he can make correct decisions on major technical issues in material supply.

We are now facing a new historical period. In order to develop social productive forces, and in order to build our country into a great and powerful socialist nation with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in a relatively short period of time, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, are about to carry out a great technical revolution and cultural revolution, on the basis of the basic victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. The situation of the Great Leap Forward is pressing. Every leading cadre of an enterprise must learn systematic production technology knowledge and transform themselves into a leader who is both red and expert, in order to unify political leadership with technical leadership.

There is a distance between going from not understanding to understanding, from being a layman to being an expert, from being only red and not expert to being both red and expert; but it is not the Great Wall, and it can be reached in a not-too-long period of time. Following the workers in labor, engaging in experimental fields, and persisting in spare-time cultural studies are important methods to eliminate this distance in practice and theory. The one hundred and sixty-five leading comrades of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant read in the morning, read in the evening, read at home, and even read on the train. They stubbornly persisted in several years of spare-time study, and the vast majority of them have already begun to study higher mathematics and specialize in metallurgy, electrical engineering, mechanical processing, and other sciences. If the comrades of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant can do it, why can't the cadres of other factories and mines do it?

Pride and complacency are enemies of learning. This sentence is very correct. Some comrades are indeed satisfied with their redness, satisfied with things they were familiar with in the past, and satisfied with general political leadership, and therefore are unwilling to seriously and honestly learn new things. However, there are also many people who do not learn because of pride and complacency, but because of inferiority. Some comrades, when they see large books and densely packed words, feel that they are for college students and experts to read, and that they, who come from a rough background, are not worthy to read these things, and dare not even touch them. There are also some comrades who once wanted to learn, and were very enthusiastic at the beginning, but later, when they got busy with work, or encountered some specific difficulties, they retreated, fantasizing about one day being able to leave their posts and go to school to study! These two types of comrades have one thing in common, that is, they are dispirited and ashamed of themselves in the face of science and technology. The only difference is that one surrendered before seeing the weapons, and the other surrendered after seeing the weapons. This is definitely not the style that our Communists should have. We have lofty revolutionary ideals, and these ideals give us endless strength. In the cruel revolutionary war, no matter how fierce the enemy's artillery fire was, we dared to take down the enemy's bastion, without fear. Now, books will not fire at us, and there are many favorable conditions for learning. If it is not because revolutionary will has declined, why can't we take down this bastion of science and technology? Therefore, enterprise leaders who want to learn science and technology, in addition to being neither proud nor arrogant, honestly, respectfully, and willingly being a primary school student, first, their minds must be liberated, they must not devalue themselves, and they must not regard science and technology as very mysterious. Second, they must muster revolutionary enthusiasm and display the fearless spirit of storming the enemy's bastions in those years. Third, they must discard illusions, that is, they should not only want to go to regular schools to study, but should be determined to learn while doing in their work. Learn a section today, learn a chapter tomorrow, accumulate over time, plus engaging in experimental fields, and you will surely learn well in three to five years.

    一定把科学技术的堡垒拿下来
    王朴
    读了第一汽车制造厂领导干部从外行变成内行的消息，想起伟大的革命导师列宁的一句话：“只要愿意学习，就一定能够学会。”可不是吗？第一汽车制造厂副厂长马诚斋同志，刚到厂的时候连钢和铁也分不清，现在，对材料供应中的重大技术性问题，都能作出正确的决定来了。
    现在，我们面临着一个新的历史时期。为了发展社会生产力，为了在比较短的时间内把我们的国家建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义伟大强国，全国人民在党的领导下，在政治战线、思想战线上的社会主义革命取得基本胜利的基础上，即将进行一场伟大的技术革命和文化革命。大跃进的形势逼人，每一个企业领导干部都必须学会系统的生产技术知识，把自己变为一个红透专深的领导者，才能把政治领导与技术领导统一起来。
    从不懂到懂，从外行到内行，从只红不专到又红又专，是有一个距离的；但不是万里长城，而是可以在不太长的时间内达到的。跟班劳动，搞试验田，坚持业余文化学习，就是从实践上、理论上消灭这个距离的重要方法。第一汽车制造厂的一百六十五位领导同志，早上读，晚上读，在家里读，在火车上也读，顽强地坚持了几年业余学习，绝大多数的人已经开始学起高等数学，专钻冶金、电工、机械加工等科学来了。第一汽车制造厂的同志能够做到的事情，为什么其它厂矿的干部做不到呢？
    骄傲自满是学习的敌人。这句话讲得十分正确。有一些同志的确满足于自己的红，满足于过去熟悉的东西，满足于一般的政治领导，因而不肯认真地老老实实地学习新的东西。但是，也有许多人并不是因为骄傲自满，而是因为自卑才不学习的。有些同志看见大部头书，看见密密麻麻的字就觉得那是大学生、专家们读的，自己老粗出身哪配读这些东西，连碰也不敢碰它。还有一些同志曾经想学，开头还学得顶起劲，后来工作一忙，或者碰到一些具体困难，就退缩了，幻想着有朝一日脱产进学校再学吧！这两类同志有一个共同点，就是在科学技术面前精神不振，自惭形秽，分别只在一个是未见刀枪就已先缴械，一个是见了刀枪以后缴械罢了。这绝不是我们共产党人所应有的风格。我们有着崇高的革命理想，这种理想给我们以无穷无尽的力量。在残酷的革命战争中，那怕敌人的炮火多猛，我们也敢把敌人的堡垒拿下来，面无惧色。现在，书本子又不会向我们开火，还有着许多有利的学习条件，要不是革命意志衰退了，为什么不能把科学技术这个堡垒攻下来呢？所以，企业领导同志要学习科学技术，除了不骄不傲，老老实实地恭恭敬敬地甘当个小学生外，第一，思想要解放，不要把自己贬得一文不值，不要把科学技术看得很神秘。第二，要鼓起革命干劲，拿出当年攻克敌人堡垒的无畏精神来。第三，要丢掉幻想，即不要一心只想进正规学校去学习，而应该决心在工作中边做边学。今天学一节，明天学一章，日积月累，加上搞试验田，不出三年五年，准能学好。
