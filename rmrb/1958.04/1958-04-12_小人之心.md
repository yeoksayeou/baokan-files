    Petty minds
    The American economy's illness is worsening, and it has infected Western Europe. At such a moment, the head of the Soviet delegation, Zakharov, at the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, proposed a suggestion hoping that all European countries and the United States would hold a ministerial meeting at the end of this year to discuss long-term ways to expand East-West trade.
    The Soviet Union's suggestion is on the one hand to build international trust, and on the other hand out of great sympathy for the victims of unemployment disasters in capitalist countries. However, some representatives of Western countries have described this proposal as the Soviet Union "trying to get the West to relax controls on the export of strategic materials to the Soviet bloc." It seems that these stubborn people have not learned a lesson from the consequences of setting up trade barriers. Socialist countries have abundant resources, mutual assistance and cooperation, only economic prosperity, and no economic crisis. Western politicians describe "sympathy" as a request to "relax control," which is truly the work of "petty minds."

    小人之心
    美国经济病势加重，而且感染了西欧。在这样一个时刻，苏联代表团团长扎哈罗夫在联合国欧洲经济委员会上提出一项建议，希望所有欧洲国家和美国在今年年底举行部长级会议，商讨扩大东西方贸易的长期办法。
    苏联的这个建议一方面是为了建立国际信任，一方面也是出于对资本主义国家里遭受失业灾祸的受害者的伟大的同情。可是，有那么一些西方国家的代表却把这个建议说成是苏联“为了使西方放宽对输往苏联集团的战略物资的控制”。看来，这些顽固不化的人并没有从设置贸易障碍的后果中吸取教训。社会主义国家资源丰富，互助合作，只有经济繁荣，没有经济危机。西方政客把“同情”说成是要求“放宽控制”，这真是十足的“小人之心”。
