    Good Production, Good Life, Good Study
    From February of this year, the Xuzhou Social Welfare Model Factory officially began producing "Baosuzhu." The right picture shows technician Lu Mingyi (left) teaching apprentice Zhao Guilan technical skills.
    After the people in the Tiehuo Street area improved their lives, they actively studied culture. By the end of April, this neighborhood committee had completed its literacy campaign. The bottom right picture shows Grandma Yuan Houfa asking her daughter to teach her to read.
    The picture below shows Grandma Li Huiqing, who used to have a very difficult life. Since participating in social welfare production, her life has improved. She has taken off her "thousand-layered clothes" and put on a new cotton-padded jacket. Look how happy she is!
