Deep Plowing Can Increase Production for Three Consecutive Seasons
Shaanxi Farmers are Expanding the Area of Deep-Plowed Land
(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 5th dispatch) Farmers in various parts of Shaanxi Province are generally adopting the method of using iron shovels to "ne" (turn over) the land (plowing) to expand the area of deep plowing. According to statistics from the Guanzhong area, the counties have already "ne" approximately 200,000 mu.

Using iron shovels to "ne" the land is an inherent experience of Shaanxi farmers. The advantages of this cultivation method are that it plows deep, generally reaching about one city foot, which is more than twice as deep as plowing with an ordinary soil plow; it can turn the topsoil and residual branches and leaves on the ground into the soil, and turn up the deep soil with undamaged granular structure; it can loosen the soil and conserve moisture, increase the fertility of the land, and make the crops have strong stalks that do not lodge. Past experience has proven that "ne" land can increase production by 30%—50% per mu, and can also guarantee continuous production increases for three consecutive seasons. "Ne" land requires three labor days per mu, and each season can increase production by ninety jin, for a total of two hundred and seventy jin of grain for three consecutive seasons. There are more than 20 million mu of fallow land in the plateau dryland of the province. These areas have one million male full laborers. If each person spends half a month to "ne" three to four mu of land, they can "ne" more than three million mu of land, increasing production by 270 million jin of grain. The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that this is a good way to cultivate land fertility and ensure continuous production increases, and has notified all localities to promote it universally.

    深翻地能连续三料增产
    陕西农民正在扩大耕地深翻面积
    本报西安5日电　陕西省各地农民正在普遍采取用铁铣抐地（翻地）的办法，扩大深耕面积。据关中地区统计，各县已经抐地二十万亩左右。
    用铁铣抐地是陕西农民固有的经验。这种耕作办法的好处是，耕的深，一般都可抐到一市尺左右，比一般土犁耕的深一倍以上；能把地面上层的熟土和残枝败叶翻入地内，把下面团粒结构没遭破坏的深层土壤倒上来；能松土保墒，增加地的肥力，使庄稼秆硬，不倒伏。据已往的经验证明：抐地每亩可增产30％—50％，还可保证连续三料增产。抐地每亩需三个劳动日，一料可增产九十斤，连续三料共可增产二百七十斤粮食。全省的高原旱地中有二千多万亩休闲土，这些地区有男全劳动力一百万人，如果以每人用半个月的时间抐三、四亩地计算，即可抐三百多万亩土地，增产二亿七千万斤粮食。中共陕西省委会认为这是一种培养地力，保证连续增产的好办法，已经通知各地普遍推广。
