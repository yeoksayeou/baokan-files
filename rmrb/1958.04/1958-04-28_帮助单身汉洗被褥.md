    Helping Bachelor Men Wash Bedding
    Our factory is in the suburban area, and single employees have difficulty taking apart and washing their bedding. Since the rectification campaign, employees' family members have responded to the call to "eliminate the four pests" and solve the difficulties of single employees, proposing to help single employees take apart and wash their bedding without compensation. When the factory union announced this, the single employees felt that they should not add to the burden of the family members and were reluctant to take out their bedding. The family members went to the single dormitories to take the bedding to be taken apart and washed while the employees were at work. When the workers returned to the dormitory at night to sleep, they found their bedding clean and tidy, and were all moved, saying: It's just like being at home.

    帮助单身汉洗被褥
    我们厂在市郊区，独身职工要拆洗被褥有困难。整风以来，职工家属响应“除四害”的号召，解决独身职工的困难，提出无代价的帮助独身职工拆洗被褥。当厂工会宣布了这件事后，独身职工觉得不应该增加家属的麻烦，都不愿意拿出被褥来。家属们就在职工上班的时候，到独身宿舍里把被褥拿去拆洗。工人晚上回宿舍睡觉，发觉自己的被褥干干净净，都感动的说：这和在家里简直没有两样。
