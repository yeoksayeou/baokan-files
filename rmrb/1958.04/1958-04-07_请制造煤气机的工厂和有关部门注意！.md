    Attention Please to Factories Manufacturing Gas Generators and Relevant Departments!
    In the great leap forward of agricultural production, the widespread purchase of gas generators for drainage or irrigation is inherently a good thing. Commercial departments should also bear the responsibility of supplying coal for gas generators to support increased agricultural production. However, due to a lack of experience and the urgency of the task, waste has already appeared in some areas, causing losses to the country. For example, a batch of gas generators manufactured in Jilin Province can only use Yangquan coal from Shanxi Province; Changle County (on the Jiaoji Railway line) and Yucheng County (north of Jinan on the Jinpu Railway line) in Shandong Province purchased a batch of gas generators in Harbin that can only use Zhalainuoer coal (near Manzhouli) from eastern Inner Mongolia. After the gas generators are manufactured or purchased, requests are made to the commercial departments for fuel supply. If the commercial departments cannot supply the required variety of coal, it will affect the development of farmland irrigation. It will only be possible to allocate coal from thousands of miles away, resulting in long-distance, cross-flow, and unreasonable transportation, wasting national transport capacity. I believe the reasons for these problems are: the former lacked comprehensive consideration in design and manufacture; the latter lacked experience and understanding. Although these are individual phenomena in the course of advancement and development, if they are not raised in time, similar problems may occur in other regions, causing greater waste to the country. Therefore, I suggest:
    1. The State Economic Commission must pay attention to the specifications of the machines and the types of coal used when distributing gas generators, taking into account that the areas using the machines should not be too far from the coal producing areas. (Shandong can be allocated gas generators that use Yangquan coal, and Jilin can be allocated gas generators that use Zhalai coal.)
    2. Gas generator manufacturers must pay attention to matching the type of coal used when designing and manufacturing gas generators, ensuring that the place of use is not too far from the producing area.
    3. Provincial planning commissions or agricultural departments must pay attention to the type of coal to be burned, ensuring that the place of use is not too far from the producing area when applying for, allocating, or purchasing gas generators.

### 请制造煤气机的工厂和有关部门注意！

    请制造煤气机的工厂和有关部门注意！
    农业生产大跃进中，为了排水或灌溉，各地纷纷购置煤气机，这本来是好事。商业部门为了支援农业增产，要供应煤气机所用的煤炭，也是应负的责任。但由于缺乏经验和时间紧、任务急；现在有些地方已经出现了浪费现象，给国家造成了损失。例如：吉林省制造了一批煤气机，只能使用山西省的阳泉煤；山东省的昌乐县（在胶济线）禹城县（在津浦县济南北）在哈尔滨购置了一批煤气机，只能使用内蒙区东部的扎来诺尔煤（在满洲里附近）。在煤气机制成或购到以后，向商业部门要求供应燃料，商业部门若不能按要求品种供应，就影响农田水利的发展，只能从数千里以外调拨煤炭，造成长途、对流的不合理运输，浪费国家运力。我认为发生这些问题的原因：前者是在设计制造时考虑欠全面；后者则是无经验和不懂行。这虽然是前进发展中的个别现象，但若不及时提出来，恐怕其他地区还会发生类似问题，给国家造成更大的浪费。因此我建议：
    1、请国家经济委员会在分配煤气机时一定要注意机器规格，使用煤炭品种，照顾到使用机器地区与煤炭产区不要距离过远。（山东可分给使用阳泉煤的煤气机，吉林可分给使用扎来煤的煤气机。）
    2、请煤气机生产部门在设计制造煤气机时一定要注意配合用煤品种，使用地与产区不要距离过远。
    3、请各省计划委员会或农业部门在申请、分配或购置煤气机时，一定要注意燃用煤炭品种，使用地与产区不要距离过远。	商业部煤建贸易局　冯稚蘅
