The socialist singing movement in various parts of Liaoning has flourished, and many new things have emerged in this movement.

Singers in the Great Leap Forward

One day, a simple middle-aged man walked to the front of the rostrum of the Newbin County's all-round Great Leap Forward oath-taking rally and began to sing passionately:

　　The battle call sounds loud,
　　The battle flag is flying,
　　We must work hard for two years with great effort,
　　Resolutely change the face of Xinbin.

His singing stirred the emotions of the attendees to a boiling point.

The singer was Comrade Fan Ziran, director of the Production Cooperation Department of the CPC Tie嶺 Prefectural Committee. Fifteen years ago, he worked in the cultural troupe of the army. This time, in response to the call of the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee for leading cadres to take the lead in singing, he composed this song at the conference and sang it to the masses immediately.

Yingkou Songs

In Yingkou City, every time people go to and from work, they hear cheerful singing from various units. Recently, the city held an 80,000-person Great Leap Forward victory celebration. People sang with great excitement, converging into a sea of songs. Gray-haired old women in Xinhuai District also took the stage, dancing and singing. The famous musician An Bo, who was present, said, "The scale and momentum of the singing movement in Yingkou has surpassed the early days of the Anti-Japanese War."

Singing Late into the Night

While Xinbin County was carrying out a sanitation campaign, the Propaganda Department of the CPC County Committee organized 300 middle school students to bring songbooks and hoes to the agricultural cooperatives to work with the farmers and teach them to sing. In the evening, the county's labor force, while working hard under the lights, sang songs that shook the mountains and rivers. After three days and nights of hard work, not only did the county's sanitation look brand new, but also 50,000 people in the county learned three songs.

Teaching an Old Man to Sing by the Cart

The singing-teaching cart in Heping District of Shenyang often roams the streets. The song teachers saw an old man who was very old and listened carefully when he learned the songs, singing each sentence very earnestly. Whenever he sang with enthusiasm, he laughed happily. The old man's name is Yuan Fengting, and he is seventy-five years old. Whenever he remembers the painful life of the old society and the new society getting better and better every day, he can't help but hum a song. After the singing movement was launched in Shenyang, he was overjoyed. Whenever he saw the singing-teaching cart parked on the street, he squeezed into the crowd to learn to sing.

Old Women's Chorus

On April 1, Dadong District of Shenyang held a cultural propaganda work competition. The most popular among the masses was the newly established old women's chorus from Shuizhalan Street. They used two choruses, "Old Mothers Sing of New China" and "Mutual Aid and Cooperation Have a Future," to express their love for the new society and won lasting applause from the people. There was originally only one old women's chorus in Nan District of Shenyang. Since the socialist singing movement was launched, nearly thirty old women's and old men's choruses have emerged.

    处处是社会主义的歌声
    新华社记者　莫镐群
    辽宁各地社会主义歌咏运动已蓬勃地开展起来，在这个运动中出现了许多新鲜事儿。
    大跃进中的歌手
    有一天，一位朴素的中年人，走到新宾县全面大跃进的誓师大会主席台前，就激昂高歌起来：
    战斗的号声响亮，
    战斗的旗帜飘扬，
    我们要以天大的干劲苦战二年，
    坚决改变新宾面貌。
    他的歌声把到会群众的情绪掀得沸腾翻滚。
    这个歌者，是中共铁岭地委生产合作部部长樊自然同志。十五年前，他曾在部队文工团做过音乐工作。这次，他响应中共辽宁省委关于领导干部要带头唱歌的号召，就在大会上创作了这首歌，马上唱给群众听。
    营口歌声
    在营口市，每到上班和下班的时候，就听到各单位一片欢快的歌声。最近这个市举行八万人的跃进报捷大会，人们以万分兴奋的心情唱起歌来，汇成了一片歌海。薪华区白发苍苍的老大娘们也登了台，边舞边唱。在场的著名音乐家安波说：“营口歌咏运动的规模声势，已经超过抗战初期了。”
    挑灯夜唱
    正当新宾全县进行卫生运动的时候，中共县委宣传部组织了三百名中学生，带着歌篇，拿着镐头，到农业社和农民一起劳动，并且教农民唱歌。到了晚间，全县劳动大军一面挑灯苦战，一面歌声震撼着山河。经过三昼夜奋战，全县不但卫生面貌焕然一新，而且全县有五万人学会了三支歌。
    教唱车前一老翁
    沈阳和平区的教唱车常常在街上流动着。教歌员们看到有一个老态龙钟的老大爷，他学歌时一句一句唱得非常认真。每唱到起劲，就乐得呵呵地笑。这个老大爷名叫苑凤亭，七十五岁了。每当他想起旧社会的痛苦生活，新社会一天比一天美好，就情不自禁地哼起歌来。歌咏运动在沈阳开展后，他乐得心花怒放，每当看见教唱车停在街头时，他就挤进人群里去学唱歌。
    老大娘合唱
    4月1日，沈阳大东区举行了文化宣传工作比武大会。最受群众欢迎的是水栅栏街刚成立的老大娘合唱团。她们用“老妈妈歌唱新中国”、“互助合作有奔头”两个合唱，表达了自己对新社会的热爱，也赢得了人们经久不息的掌声。沈阳市原来只有南市区一个老大娘合唱团，自从开展社会主义歌咏运动以后，已经出现近三十个老大娘和老大爷合唱团。
