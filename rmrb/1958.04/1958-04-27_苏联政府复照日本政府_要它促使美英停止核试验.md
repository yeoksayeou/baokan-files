Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 26th: Moscow newspapers published on the 25th a reply from the Soviet government to the Japanese government, in which it expressed hope that the Japanese government would support the Soviet Union's efforts to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The Soviet government's note was a response to a memorandum from the Japanese government on April 4 to the governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union regarding the cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

The Soviet government's reply stated that the universal cessation of nuclear testing cannot be resolved by the unilateral efforts of the Soviet Union alone. This goal can only be achieved if the Soviet initiative is supported by the United States and Britain.

The Soviet government's reply also pointed out that Japan was the first country to suffer from the scourge of atomic weapons, and its demands for the cessation of nuclear weapons testing have great moral force. If the Japanese government can use its influence to demand that the U.S. and British governments, like the Soviet Union, stop nuclear weapons testing, it would greatly benefit the cause.

    苏联政府复照日本政府
    要它促使美英停止核试验
    新华社莫斯科26日电　莫斯科各报25日发表了苏联政府给日本政府的一份复照，它希望日本政府支持苏联在停止试验原子武器和氢武器方面的努力。
    苏联政府的这份照会是对日本政府4月4日给美、英、苏三国政府一项关于停止核武器试验的备忘录的答复。
    苏联政府的复照说，只是苏联单方面努力不可能解决普遍停止核试验的问题。只有在苏联的倡议得到美英两国支持的情况下，才能达到这个目的。
    苏联政府的复照还指出，日本是遭到原子武器祸害的第一个国家，它在停止核武器试验方面的要求有很大的道义力量。如果日本政府能利用它的影响要求美英政府也像苏联一样停止核武器试验，它就会给事业带来很大好处。
