Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 10th: The "Ulan Muqir" (Mongolian: Red Detachment of Culture), experimentally established in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has been warmly welcomed by herdsmen and has proven to be a good organizational form for carrying out mass cultural work in pastoral areas.

The "Ulan Muqir" is a mobile cultural center. It was first experimentally established in Sunite Right Banner, Xilin Gol League, in June last year, adapting to the vast grasslands, the year-round nomadic life of herdsmen, and the characteristics of the Mongolian people. It is active in the settlements of herdsmen according to the seasonal pastures. The storytellers, dancers, and propagandists of the "Ulan Muqir," following the footsteps of the herdsmen, drive horse-drawn carts, carrying radios, slides, national musical instruments, national song and dance costumes, and books and newspapers, bringing the culture and art loved by Mongolian herdsmen to the yurts. Last year, this "Ulan Muqir" traveled more than a thousand li on the Sunite grassland, organizing cultural and entertainment propaganda activities for more than 14,000 people. During the activities of the "Ulan Muqir," herdsmen of both sexes sat outside the yurts, listening to the radio, looking at pictures, and asking questions. At the Daqiaoerji Temple, after the "Ulan Muqir" sang the "Haolaibao" publicizing health knowledge, Lama Sangbula said, "This Haolaibao seems to be criticizing me. In the future, I can't just drink alcohol and ignore hygiene." This "Ulan Muqir" not only enlivened the cultural life of herdsmen throughout the banner, but also carried out propaganda and education on disaster resistance and animal protection, livestock feeding management, maternal and child health, and current affairs policies to herdsmen of both sexes through cultural and entertainment activities. The hard work of the "Ulan Muqir" staff has been warmly welcomed by Mongolian herdsmen.

Since last autumn, pure pastoral banners in Inner Mongolia, such as Ongniud Banner, Zhenglan Banner, and Bairin Right Banner, have successively transformed their original cultural centers into "Ulan Muqir." This year, pure pastoral banners in Xilin Gol League, Chahar League, and Bayannur League will all establish "Ulan Muqir" to carry out mass cultural work in pastoral areas.

    把文化艺术送到蒙古包去
    内蒙古试办“乌兰牧骑”成功
    新华社呼和浩特10日电　内蒙古自治区试办的“乌兰牧骑”（蒙语：红色之部），深受牧民欢迎，已被证明为开展牧区群众文化工作的良好组织形式。
    “乌兰牧骑”就是巡回流动文化馆。它是适应草原辽阔、牧民常年游牧和蒙古民族的特点，去年6月首先在锡林郭勒盟苏尼特右旗试办起来的。它按照牧区四季牧场，经常活动在牧民定居点上。“乌兰牧骑”的说唱艺人，歌舞演员和宣传人员，追随着牧民的行踪，赶着马车，携带着收音机、幻灯片、民族乐器、民族歌舞服装和图书画报等，把蒙古族牧民喜爱的文化艺术送到蒙古包里。去年，这个“乌兰牧骑”在苏尼特草原上行程一千多里，组织文娱宣传活动达一万四千多人次。在“乌兰牧骑”活动时，男女牧民们坐在蒙古包外，听广播，看图画，问长问短。在达巧尔吉庙，“乌兰牧骑”演唱了宣传卫生常识的“好来宝”后，喇嘛桑布拉说：“这个好来宝，好像是批评我，今后我可不能只顾喝酒，不管卫生了。”这个“乌兰牧骑”不仅活跃了全旗牧民的文化生活，并通过文娱活动向男女牧民们进行了抗灾保畜、牲畜饲养管理、妇婴卫生和时事政策等方面的宣传教育。“乌兰牧骑”工作人员的辛勤劳动，受到了蒙古族牧民的热诚欢迎。
    从去年秋季以来，内蒙古的翁牛特旗、正蓝旗和巴林右旗等纯牧业旗，也先后将原有的文化馆改建为“乌兰牧骑”。今年，锡林郭勒盟、察哈尔盟和巴彦淖尔盟的纯牧业旗，都将建立“乌兰牧骑”，以开展牧区群众文化工作。
