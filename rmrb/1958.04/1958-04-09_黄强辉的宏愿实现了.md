China's second world record in weightlifting was created on the evening of the 7th at the 1958 National Twenty-Five Unit Weightlifting Championships held in Chongqing.

At 23:20 that evening, Huang Qianghui, China's famous lightweight weightlifter, successfully clean and jerked a 155 kg barbell, breaking the lightweight clean and jerk world record of 154 kg held by Soviet athlete Saksonov. He is the second famous athlete in China, after Chen Jingkai, to reach the peak of the world record in weightlifting by creating the world record in the clean and jerk in the flyweight class. He is also the fourth outstanding athlete in China, following Chen Jingkai, Qi Lieyun (100-meter breaststroke), and Zheng Fengrong (women's high jump), to set a world record.

During the competition on the 7th, Huang Qianghui easily clean and jerked 145 kg on his first attempt. When the number 155 kg suddenly appeared on the scoreboard, the entire audience was greatly excited. Only after repeated requests from the announcer did the audience quiet down. Huang Qianghui slowly entered the arena, tightened his belt, and stepped onto the weightlifting platform. At this moment, the entire venue was silent, and thousands of pairs of expectant and enthusiastic eyes were fixed on him. He failed to clean and jerk 155 kg on his second attempt. The audience remained quietly expectant.

In less than a minute, Huang Qianghui re-entered the arena. When he cleanly and neatly clean and jerked the 155 kg barbell for the third time, the excessively excited five thousand spectators suddenly erupted in thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers. Young Pioneers immediately poured into the arena to present flowers to Huang Qianghui. The staff on the field could not help but rush up and lift Huang Qianghui high. The applause and cheers became even more enthusiastic at this moment.

To clean and jerk 155 kg and break the world record of 154 kg in the lightweight clean and jerk was a major concern that lingered in Huang Qianghui's mind day and night. He had attempted to lift 155 kg three times in international weightlifting competitions. On July 7th last year, when he defeated Japanese lightweight weightlifter Kenji Onuma in Beijing, his initial attempt to clean and jerk 155 kg was unsuccessful. On August 7th last year, at the 3rd International Youth Friendship Games in Moscow, in order to compete for the championship and set a world record, Huang Qianghui was injured during the snatch, and he still ambitiously attempted to clean and jerk a 155 kg barbell, but because of his injured right knee and insufficient arm strength, he still failed. In March of this year, he participated in the Moscow Prize International Weightlifting Individual Championships and defeated all his strong opponents with a total score of 382.5 kg, winning the lightweight championship. However, Huang Qianghui felt that the only shortcoming was that he failed again to clean and jerk 155 kg in this competition.

Repeated failures and repeated attempts did not discourage Huang Qianghui in the slightest. In order to realize his wish to break the world record and win glory for the motherland, the weightlifting athlete's will became stronger, and his training and research of techniques became more diligent and assiduous. Focusing on his weaknesses, he particularly emphasized training his leg and arm strength. On the evening of the 7th, more than 5,000 spectators in Chongqing watched with excitement and enthusiasm as Huang Qianghui turned his grand ambition into reality. But Huang Qianghui was not satisfied. He said that he would soon use even higher achievements to repay the motherland's people for their care and expectations.

Huang Qianghui only started practicing weightlifting in 1952. At the National Weightlifting Test Meeting held in China in March 1955, his clean and jerk result was only 115 kg. Since then, he has been advancing at a rapid pace. In just three years, he has climbed to the peak of the world record in the lightweight clean and jerk with a lift of 155 kg. (Attached picture)

    黄强辉的宏愿实现了
    新华社记者　胡明俊　龚成华
    我国运动员创造的第二个举重世界新纪录，7日晚在重庆举行的1958年全国二十五单位举重锦标赛大会上诞生了。
    当晚二十三点二十分，我国著名的轻量级举重健将黄强辉双手挺举起一百五十五公斤重的杠铃，刷新了苏联运动员萨克索诺夫保持的一百五十四公斤的轻量级双手挺举世界纪录。他是我国继陈镜开创造最轻量级双手挺举世界纪录后的第二个攀上举重世界纪录高峰的名将，也是我国继陈镜开、戚烈云（蛙泳一百公尺）、郑凤荣（女子跳高）等创造世界纪录之后的第四个创造世界纪录的优秀运动员。
    7日比赛时，黄强辉第一次就轻轻挺举起一百四十五公斤。当比赛场的记分牌上突然出现一百五十五公斤的数字时，全场观众大为轰动，经广播员一再请求，观众才安静下来。黄强辉缓缓出场，紧束一下腰带，走上举重台，这时全场寂然无声，几千双期望的热情的眼睛全盯住他。他第二次挺举一百五十五公斤，没有成功。观众们还是照样安静地期待着。
    不到一分钟，黄强辉又出了场。当他第三次十分干净利落地把一百五十五公斤重的杠铃挺举起时，过分兴奋激动的五千观众猛然爆发出巨雷般的掌声和狂热的欢呼。少先队队员即刻涌进比赛场向黄强辉献花。场上的工作人员情不自禁地涌上去把黄强辉高举起来。掌声和欢呼声这时更加热烈了。
    想挺举起一百五十五公斤，打破轻量级挺举一百五十四公斤的世界纪录，是黄强辉日夜萦怀的一桩重大心事。他在国际举重比赛中，曾三次试举一百五十五公斤。去年7月7日在北京打败日本轻量级举重选手大沼贤治的时候，初试挺举一百五十五公斤没有成功。去年8月7日在莫斯科举行的第三届国际青年友谊运动会上，为了争夺冠军和创造世界纪录，黄强辉在抓举时受伤，在挺举时还雄心勃勃地试举一百五十五公斤重量的杠铃，但因他右膝受伤和臂力不足，仍然没有举上去。今年3月，他参加莫斯科奖国际举重个人锦标赛，以三百八十二点五公斤的总成绩打败所有劲敌，获得了轻量级冠军。但是，黄强辉认为美中不足的是，他在这次比赛中再一次试举一百五十五公斤又没有成功。
    屡次失败，屡次试举，失败一点也没有使黄强辉气馁。为了实现打破世界纪录为祖国争光的愿望，这位举重健将的意志更坚强了，锻炼和钻研技术也更勤奋刻苦了。他针对自己的弱点，特别着重练习腿力和臂力。7日晚上，重庆市五千多观众怀着兴奋和激动的心情，看见黄强辉把宏愿变成了事实。但是黄强辉并不满足，他说，不久他要以更高的成绩来报答祖国人民对他的关怀和期望。
    黄强辉1952年才开始练习举重，1955年3月我国举行的全国举重测验会上，他的挺举成绩只有一百一十五公斤。以后，他以飞快的步伐跃进着，在仅仅三年的时间，他就以挺举一百五十五公斤登上轻量级挺举世界纪录的顶峰。（附图片）
