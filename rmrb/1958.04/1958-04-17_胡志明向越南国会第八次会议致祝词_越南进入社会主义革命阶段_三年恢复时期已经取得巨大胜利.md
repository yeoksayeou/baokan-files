Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 16th: The Eighth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a politically significant event in the history of the Vietnamese revolution, solemnly opened this morning at the Hanoi Grand Theater.

Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, delivered a congratulatory message to the assembly. He emphasized that the revolution in North Vietnam has entered a new stage, the stage of socialist revolution. The aim of this revolution is to eliminate the system of exploitation of man by man, so that people can have enough food and clothing. He said this is a great and glorious cause in Vietnamese history.

President Ho Chi Minh also said that this National Assembly session is being held in an environment where significant changes have taken place in the domestic and international situation. The socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, is more united and stronger than ever before. Vietnam has victoriously completed the arduous task of economic and cultural recovery during the three-year period. He pointed out that the great victory achieved during the recovery period in Vietnam proves that the line adopted by the Vietnam Workers' Party, the government, and the National Assembly regarding the recovery period was entirely correct.

Prior to President Ho Chi Minh's speech, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, delivered the opening address. He said that this National Assembly session marks past victories and leads the people to a new period of struggle and construction. This National Assembly session will mainly discuss important issues concerning the development and transformation of the national economy along socialist lines, and will approve the 1958 national plan and budget. At the same time, it will resolve issues concerning the improvement of state organs and the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and the Vietnam Workers' Party. These issues are problems in the period of transition to socialism in North Vietnam.

The meeting this morning also heard a report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly by Vice-Chairman Ton Quang Phiet of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly.
