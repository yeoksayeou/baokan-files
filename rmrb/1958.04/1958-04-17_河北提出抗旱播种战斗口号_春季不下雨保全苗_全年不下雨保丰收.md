This newspaper's Baoding dispatch on the 16th: The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged plenary meeting in Baoding from the 7th to the 13th of April. The central issue discussed at the meeting was mobilizing all Party members and people in Hebei Province to immediately take action under the battle cry of "Ensure full seedling emergence without spring rain, ensure a bumper harvest without rain all year round," resolutely overcome the drought, ensure timely sowing, and guarantee a bumper harvest of summer crops.

Last winter and this spring, Hebei Province achieved great success in water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. The socialist ideological awareness of cadres and the masses has been greatly enhanced, their enthusiasm is high, and leadership methods have also been greatly improved, creating an extremely favorable situation for a great leap forward in agricultural production.

However, the entire province has experienced little snow and no rain for more than two hundred days from September of last year to the present. The current spring drought is extremely severe, and spring plowing and sowing, as well as striving for a bumper wheat harvest, are facing serious difficulties. Therefore, the meeting believes that all Party members and people in the province, and all levels of organizations and departments in the province, should immediately mobilize and go all out to advance against the drought, making every effort to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, ensure timely sowing, and guarantee full and thriving seedlings.

The meeting called on all regions to launch a more resolute and enthusiastic high tide of water conservancy construction, focusing on ensuring timely sowing and ensuring timely watering of wheat, concentrating efforts on water conservancy projects directly used for anti-drought sowing, and making full use of existing water conservancy equipment, advocating rational water use and water conservation. In areas where water conservancy irrigation has not been achieved, the plains must dig large numbers of earth wells, pits, ponds, water tanks, and springs, while mountainous areas must universally build water ponds, simple reservoirs, intercept spring floods, and dig springs. Areas with abundant labor and good soil moisture should promote the spirit of communism and support drought-stricken areas.

In order to guarantee the realization of a summer harvest, the meeting required all regions in the province to strengthen wheat management, striving to achieve a yield of more than 300 jin per mu in high-yield wheat fields, and at the same time change the yield situation in low-yield areas with yields of less than 100 jin per mu. In order to realize this year's grain production increase plan, the meeting believes that it is necessary to greatly develop high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes, rice, corn, and multi-eared sorghum, and ensure that they are sown according to plan and on time.

    河北提出抗旱播种战斗口号
    春季不下雨保全苗
    全年不下雨保丰收
    本报保定16日电　中共河北省委员会7日到13日在保定举行全体扩大会议。会议讨论的中心问题是动员河北省全体党员和人民，在“春不下雨保全苗，年不下雨保丰收”的战斗口号下，立即行动起来，坚决战胜干旱，保证适时播种，保证夏收作物丰收。
    去冬今春，河北省水利建设和积肥都获得了巨大成绩，干部和群众的社会主义思想觉悟大大提高，干劲十足，领导方法也有很大改善，出现了对农业生产大跃进极为有利的形势。
    但是，全省从去年9月到现在，二百多天以来，少雪无雨，目前春旱极为严重，春耕播种和争取小麦丰收面临着严重的困难。因此，会议认为，全省所有党员和人民，全省各级组织和各部门，应当立即动员起来，全力以赴，向干旱进军，千方百计地克服一切困难障碍，保证按时播种，保证苗全苗旺。
    会议号召各地以保证按时播种，保证小麦按时浇水为中心，再掀起一个更坚决、更热烈的水利建设高潮，集中力量进行直接用于抗旱播种的水利工程，并充分利用现有的水利工程设备，提倡合理用水，节约用水。没有实现水利灌溉的地区，平原要大量挖土井、坑塘、水柜和挖泉，山区要普遍修水汪，修简易水库，拦蓄春汛，凿泉。劳力多、墒情好的地方，要发扬共产主义精神，支援干旱地区。
    为了保证实现夏季丰收，会议要求全省各地加强小麦管理，力争小麦丰产田每亩的产量达到三百斤以上，同时要改变亩产一百斤以下的低产地区的产量情况。为了实现今年粮食增产计划，会议认为必须大量发展甘薯、水稻、玉米、多穗高粱等高产作物，并且保证按计划按时播种。
