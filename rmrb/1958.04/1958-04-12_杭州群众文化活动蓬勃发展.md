Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou: More than 2,000 mass cultural workers in Hangzhou held a pledge rally for a great leap forward in mass cultural work on the afternoon of April 6th. Under the great leap forward situation, mass cultural activities in various government offices, schools, factories, and rural areas of Hangzhou are flourishing. More than 130 agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs have universally established singing teams, and every farmer participating in cultural learning has learned to sing one or two songs. Farmers of the Shengli Cooperative in the suburbs have composed this year’s production plan into a "Shuang Kan Xiang" tune for singing. Workers at the Fuhua Silk Factory have composed the target of handing over 1.41 million yuan in profits this year into a "Yang Liu Qing" tune, which is broadcast on the wired broadcast to encourage workers' production enthusiasm. In mid-March this year, the Hangzhou First Cultural Center organized a propaganda team, using advanced deeds in factories as themes, and compiled short and concise storytelling materials with rich content to sing in the original factories, which was warmly welcomed by the workers.
