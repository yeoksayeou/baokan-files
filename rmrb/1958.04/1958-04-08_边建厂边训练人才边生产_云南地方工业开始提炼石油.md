Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 6th: Yunnan Province is vigorously developing local petroleum industries by adopting the method of building factories, training technical personnel, and producing simultaneously. According to preliminary plans of Rongfeng and nine other counties, this year's oil production will reach 10,000 to 15,000 tons.

Currently, counties such as Luquan are using relatively simple low-temperature dry distillation and heap dry distillation methods to extract crude oil from oil shale, lignite, and bituminous coal, and then fractionating gasoline, diesel, and asphalt from the crude oil. Xiaolongtan Coal Mine in Kaiyuan County, Fengming Village Coal Mine in Yiliang County, and six other places including Luquan County have all produced oil after a period of experimentation.

Yunnan Province has abundant raw materials for synthetic petroleum, and most counties have the conditions to establish small-scale refineries.

    边建厂边训练人才边生产
    云南地方工业开始提炼石油
    据新华社昆明6日电　云南省采用边建厂、边训练技术人才、边生产的办法，正在大力发展地方石油工业。榕峰等九个县的初步计划，今年要产油一万吨到一万五千吨。
    现在，禄劝等县正用比较简单的低温干馏法和成堆干馏法从油母页岩、褐煤、烟煤中提炼原油，再由原油中分馏汽油、柴油和沥青。开远县小龙潭煤矿、宜良县凤鸣村煤矿和禄劝县等六个地方，经过一段时间的试验都已经炼出油来。
    云南省人造石油原料很多，绝大部分县都有条件办小型炼油厂。
