    Plunge into Spring Plowing with Real Effort
    Jiangsu Holds Spring Plowing Inspection Broadcast Conference and Issues Mobilization Order

    (Our newspaper dispatch) According to the *Xinhua Daily*, Jiangsu Province's spring plowing and sowing are about to be launched universally throughout the province. In order to do a good job in spring plowing and sowing in accordance with the requirements of the Great Leap Forward, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee held a broadcast conference on the afternoon of the 3rd, attended by more than 7 million cadres and masses, to further inspect the preparation work for spring plowing and sowing, and issued a general mobilization order to strive for a complete victory in spring plowing and sowing.

    At the broadcast conference, Comrade Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, called on all localities to summon up their energy, continue to work hard and practically, and fight to the end for the great victory of spring plowing and sowing. He said that production plans must take root among the masses, and the deeper the roots, the better. However, in some places, the plans are still only staying among a few township and commune leading cadres, and have not taken root among the masses. The key to solving this problem lies first in correcting the conservative thinking of some township and commune cadres, such as their fear of difficulties and complacency. Among them, some people do not see the conditions for the Great Leap Forward clearly, and their measures cannot keep up with the production targets; others do not believe in the masses, do not see the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses, or are afraid to hand over the plans to the masses for discussion when they hear the opinions of a few backward masses, fearing that they will be rejected by the masses. The Great Leap Forward plan is not an article on paper; to realize it, we must rely on the strength of the broad masses. Only by mobilizing the masses to fully discuss it can the plan become the masses' own program of action, and only then can they consciously struggle to realize this plan. Among the masses, there are advanced, intermediate, and backward elements. If we want advanced thinking to take the lead, we must go through great airing of views, great contending and great debates. The process of mobilizing the masses to debate the plan is a process of educating the masses, a process of advanced elements leading backward elements, and also a process of supplementing and revising the plan with the wisdom of the masses. We should use the rectification movement to achieve a score of ten targets and twelve measures, so that the target plan takes root among the masses, and achieve "three guarantees to the field" and "everything to the person."

    Representatives from Suining, Changshu, and Jingjiang counties, which have done a better job in preparation for plowing, reported on their work at the meeting.

              Five Hundred Jin Target, Eight Hundred Jin Measures, One Thousand Jin Drive

    Comrade Wang Hengshan, Secretary of the Suining County Party Committee, introduced the specific requirements of Suining County for spring plowing and sowing at the broadcast conference: meticulous plowing and harrowing, sufficient base fertilizer, selecting seeds for everything, timely sowing, rational close planting, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. In order to achieve this requirement, the county party committee organized forces to take responsibility for specific areas, and assisted township and commune cadres in carrying out "eight inspections" and "three comparisons." The eight inspections are: inspecting crop layout, inspecting seeds and fertilizers, inspecting land preparation and moisture conservation, inspecting agricultural tools and pesticides, inspecting the arrangement of labor and livestock, inspecting the promotion of technology, inspecting whether water sources meet the needs, and inspecting the implementation of the national sowing plan. The three comparisons are: comparing measures, comparing quality, and comparing drive. Through the "eight inspections," 186 out of the 467 agricultural cooperatives in the county had measures exceeding the production increase targets, 181 cooperatives had measures that were equal to the targets, and 100 cooperatives had measures that were lower than the targets. Through the inspections and comparisons, all cooperatives have formulated new Great Leap Forward measures to ensure a target of 500 *jin*, measures of 800 *jin*, and a drive of 1000 *jin*.

                Inspection Team is a Promotion Team, a Technical Team, a Production Increase Team

    Comrade Sui Xingchu, First Secretary of the Changshu County Party Committee, introduced the experience of organizing a large-scale inspection of preparation for plowing at the meeting.

    The main feature of Changshu County's large-scale spring plowing inspection is that it organized a large-scale airing of views, great contending and great debates in the form of big-character posters around the large-scale inspection, and mobilized the masses to offer suggestions and advice, which vigorously promoted production.

    The inspection team not only helped to discover problems and promote solutions, but also set an example on the ground. When the inspection team inspected the Outang Township, they found that the cadres and the masses did not believe that they could plow deeply, so they immediately gathered more than a dozen plowing cattle on the spot to perform and help find the knack for deep plowing to five inches. Therefore, wherever the inspection team went, the production upsurge was brought there, and it was welcomed by the cadres and the masses there. People called the inspection team the "Promotion Team," "Technical Team," and "Production Increase Team."

                    Organize All Departments to Serve Spring Plowing

    Comrade Sun Pu, Deputy Secretary of the Jingjiang County Party Committee, introduced the process of organizing all departments to serve spring plowing.

    All departments in Jingjiang County guaranteed to support agricultural production, and they did what they said. All the staff of Jingcheng Iron Works and Mechanical Repair Station worked hard for three days and trial-produced the "May 8th" single-furrow plow, and worked continuously for seven days to complete 2,000 racks of nutrient bowls, and trial-produced a green feed shredder in 20 days. The commercial departments organized a large number of salespersons to actively deliver goods to the countryside, "visiting customers at the door, and using the ridges as counters," saving more than 5,000 workdays for the rural areas every day. Various agencies and schools also contributed 900,000 *dan* of fertilizer, 45,000 yuan in cash, three tractors, more than 20 head of plowing cattle, and more than 400 pieces of double-wheeled double-furrow plows, rice threshers, etc. The farmers responded very well, saying that this is "enjoying the blessings of the Great Leap Forward and taking advantage of the rectification."

    This broadcast conference to inspect spring plowing and sowing greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres in the province. After listening to the broadcast conference, more than 90,000 people in Liyang County were determined to achieve "standardized spring plowing and sowing." More than 1,600 party members and members of the Communist Youth League in Houzhou Township, who listened to the broadcast collectively, each took production tools and gas lamps and small lamps, and went back to mobilize more than 9,000 people in the whole township to prepare for practical work. Tangxia Cooperative in Yangzhuang Township is a first-class high-yield cooperative in the province. They originally thought that their conditions were good and their work was well done. After listening to the broadcast, they thought that they were far inferior to others, so they revised the plan. The fertilizer was increased from 1,900 *dan* per *mu* to 2,200 *dan*, and the grain selection of rice was increased from the original 10% to 100%, and the deep plowing was increased from the original five inches to six and a half inches.

    More than 300,000 people in Suining County listened to the broadcast conference. The county party committee decided that after listening to the broadcast conference, they would immediately put into action and quickly mobilize, and the county was preparing to organize a spring plowing and sowing inspection and promotion team of more than 700 people, so that each township had a sub-team and each cooperative had an inspection team to implement the call of the provincial party committee at this broadcast conference. The slogan of this county's spring sowing action is: the secretary takes command, the elite troops are dispatched, a comprehensive inspection is carried out, every *mu* is examined, the whole people fight bravely, and it is completed in ten days.

    After listening to Comrade Liu Shunyuan's instructions, the cadres and members of the Chengbei Agricultural Cooperative in Lianshui County conducted a mass inspection and debate on spring plowing work on the spot, further boosting their enthusiasm, and decided to finally eliminate all the 600 *mu* of alkaline land in the cooperative on the same day.

    拿出实干劲头闹春耕
    江苏举行春耕检查广播大会下达动员令
    本报讯　据新华日报报道：江苏省的春耕春种即将在全省范围内普遍展开。为了按照大跃进的要求，做好春耕春种工作，江苏省委3日下午举行了有七百多万干部和群众参加的广播大会，进一步检查春耕春种的准备工作，下达了力争春耕春种全胜总动员令。
    在广播大会上，省委书记刘顺元同志号召各地鼓足干劲，继续苦干实干，为争取春耕春种的伟大胜利而战斗到底。他说，生产规划一定要在群众中落脚生根，根扎得越深越好。但是，有些地方规划还只是停留在少数乡、社领导干部当中，没有在群众中扎下根来。解决这个问题的关键，首先在于纠正某些乡、社干部的畏难、自满等保守思想。他们当中，有的人对跃进的条件看不清楚，措施跟不上产量指标；有的人不相信群众，看不到广大群众的社会主义积极性，或者是听到少数落后群众的意见，就不敢把规划交给群众去讨论，怕被群众顶回来。跃进规划不是纸上文章，要实现，一定要依靠广大群众的力量。只有发动群众充分讨论，才能使规划变成群众自己的行动纲领，才能使他们自觉地为实现这个规划而奋斗。群众中有先进的、有中间的、也有落后的。如果要先进思想挂帅，就必须通过大鸣大放大辩论。发动群众辩论规划的过程，就是教育群众的过程，就是以先进带动落后的过程，也是以群众的智慧补充和修订规划的过程。我们应该通过整风整社，做到十分指标、十二分措施，做到指标规划在群众中扎根，做到“三包四到田”、“条条通到人”。
    备耕工作做得较好的睢宁、常熟、靖江三县的代表，在会上作了工作汇报。
              五百斤指标，八百斤措施，一千斤干劲
    中共睢宁县委书记王恒山同志，在广播大会上介绍了睢宁县春耕春种的具体要求：精耕细耙、施足基肥、样样选种、适时播种、合理密植、防治病虫害。为了实现这个要求，县委组织力量，分片包干，协助乡、社干部开展了“八查”“三比。”八查是：查作物布局、查种子和肥料、查整地保墒、查农具农药、查劳力畜力的安排、查技术的推广、查水源是否满足需要、查执行国家播种计划情况。三比是：比措施、比质量、比干劲。全县四百六十七个农业社通过“八查”，增产措施超过增产指标的有一百八十六个社，措施和指标相平的有一百八十一个社，措施低于指标的有一百个社。各社通过查比，都订出新的跃进措施，保证指标五百斤，措施八百斤，干劲一千斤。
                检查团是促进团技术团增产团
    常熟县委第一书记隋性初同志，在会上介绍了组织备耕大检查的经验。
    常熟县春耕大检查的主要特点是围绕大检查，组织了以大字报为主要形式的大鸣大放大辩论，发动群众献计谋，提建议，有力地推动了生产。
    检查团不但帮助发现问题，促进解决问题，而且还实地做出样子。检查团在藕塘乡检查时，发现干部群众不相信可以深耕，就当场集中了十多头耕牛，现场表演，帮助找出深耕五寸的窍门。因此，检查团走到那里，生产高潮带到那里，受到那里干部群众的欢迎，人们称呼检查团为“促进团”、“技术团”、“增产团”。
                    组织各部门为春耕服务
    中共靖江县委副书记孙普介绍了组织各部门为春耕服务的经过。
    靖江县各部门保证支持农业生产，说到做到。靖城铁业社和机械修配站全体职工苦战了三天，试制成“五八式”单铧犁，连干七天，完成了营养钵器二千架，在二十天内试制成青饲料切碎机。各商业部门组织大批售货员主动送货下乡，“登门拜顾客，田埂当柜台”，每天为农村节省了五千多个劳动日。各机关、学校也献出九十万担肥料，现款四万五千元，拖拉机三台，耕牛二十多头和双轮双铧犁、打稻机等四百多件。农民反映很好，说这是“享的跃进福，占的整风光”。
    这次检查春耕春种广播大会，大大鼓舞了全省群众和干部的干劲。溧阳县九万余人听到广播大会后，决心做到“春耕春播规格化”。后周乡集体收听的一千六百余名党、团员，个个带着生产工具和汽灯、小灯，回去发动全乡九千多人准备实干。杨庄乡棠下社是全省一等丰产社，他们原来认为自己条件好，工作做得不错了，听了广播以后，认为远远比不上人家，就修改了规划。肥料由每亩一千九百担提高为二千二百担，水稻粒选由原来的10％提高到100％，深耕由原来的五寸增加为六寸半。
    睢宁县有三十多万人收听广播大会。县委决定听完广播大会后，立即迅速投入行动，全县准备组织七百多人的春耕春种检查促进团，做到乡乡有分团、社社有检查组，具体贯彻省委在这次广播大会上的号召。这个县的春种行动口号是：书记挂帅，精兵出动，全面检查，亩亩过堂，全民奋战，十天完成。
    涟水县城北农业社的干部和社员听了刘顺元同志的指示后，就在收听的现场上，对春耕工作进行群众性的检查和辩论，进一步鼓足干劲，并决定在当天把全社六百多亩碱田最后全部消灭。
