【Changzhi, 21st dispatch】 Li Quanchen, company commander of the 40th Regiment of Yan's army stationed in Niangziguan, opposed the heinous civil war because of the murder of his father. He resolutely deserted the unit and defected to our Zhengtai Road North Liberated Area at the end of June, receiving a warm welcome from the local military and civilians. Company Commander Li is from Zhenhuang Village (eight li west of the city) in Pingding. On June 25, when the Yan stubborns in Pingding city attacked the village to seize wheat, Li's father, Li Cunren, was brutally murdered, and his head was taken into the city, falsely claiming to have killed our district chief, and held a celebration. Several days later, Company Commander Li learned of this and was grief-stricken. He immediately rushed into the city hoping to retrieve his father's head for burial, but unexpectedly he was reprimanded by his regimental commander and the stubborn county magistrate of Pingding, and his father's head could not be found. In grief and indignation, Company Commander Li realized the sinisterness of the anti-communist civil war, that so-called "suppression of communists" was actually slaughtering the people, and that his own father was killed by the very troops he had joined. Serving the reactionaries and engaging in civil war turned out to be slaughtering one's own father and brothers. In order to resolutely oppose the heinous civil war and avenge his father, Company Commander Li defected to our army on his way back to Niangziguan. Furthermore, our Pingding County government has ordered the Fifth District Office to send personnel to Li's home to offer condolences and comfort, and called on the people to arm themselves for self-defense, and called on all county militias to avenge Company Commander Li's father and countless others who were killed.

　　为反动派服务就是屠杀自己父兄
    李连长愤投我军   
    平定县府号召全县民兵为李父复仇
    【长治二十一日电】驻娘子关之阎军四十团李权臣连长，因杀父之仇，反对万恶的内战，毅然脱离该部，于六月底投奔我正太路北解放区，受到当地军民的热烈欢迎。李连长为平定镇簧村（城西八里）人，六月二十五日平定城阎顽进攻该村抢麦时，李父李存仁惨遭杀害，并将人头带入城中，伪称杀死我区长，开会庆祝。数日后李连长获悉，悲痛欲绝，立即赶入城中冀索回父头安葬，岂知反被其团长与平定顽县长训斥一顿，父头亦无处觅获。李连长于悲愤之余，始悟反共内战之罪恶，所谓“剿共”即屠杀人民，亲身父亲竟为自己参加的部队所杀，为反动派服务进行内战原来就是屠杀自己的父兄。李连长为坚决反对万恶的内战，为父亲报仇，遂于返娘子关途中投奔我军。又：我平定县府已令五区公所派员赴李家吊祭安慰，并号召人民武装自卫，号召全县民兵为李连长父亲及无数被杀者复仇。                            （杨子菁）
