    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] Moscow News: The Soviet Union is actively rebuilding South Sakhalin. Twenty-two coal mines, twenty-nine fish canning companies, two tanneries, and six large paper mills, leather factories, etc. have all started work, and most factories have been expanded. There are 195 primary and secondary schools, and more than 120 hospitals and clinics in South Sakhalin. Cinemas and opera houses are performing and open in various cities. Transportation and navigation have begun between Vladivostok and the ports of South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. Sakhalin also has 700 kilometers of railway open to traffic. The island will have modern fishing grounds and shipyards, repair shops, and first-class modernly equipped canneries. In a few years, the island's coal production will reach half of the entire Far East's pre-war production.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] Tokyo News: The Tokyo Times reported: "Japanese people in South Sakhalin, liberated from the oppression of Japanese landlords and Zaibatsu, have obtained their own land and will no longer endure any suffering from exploitation." Also, the Asahi Shimbun stated: "The life of the masses is steadily improving. In the Soviet authorities' restoration work, the canning industry, fishery, and commerce, which were suffocated by the military in the past, have been restored. Japanese residents have been liberated under the Soviet system."
