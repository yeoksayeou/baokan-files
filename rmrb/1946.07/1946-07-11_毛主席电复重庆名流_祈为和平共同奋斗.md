　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Chongqing celebrities Huang Mo Han, Huang Ci Xian, Deng Chu Min, and 4,271 others, previously sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Mao appealing for peace. Chairman Mao sent the following reply on the 5th:

　　To Mr. Huang Mo Han, Mr. Huang Ci Xian, Mr. Deng Chu Min, and other gentlemen in Chongqing:

　　Having read your telegram, I am most impressed with your insightful views! Insisting on peace and opposing civil war is the only national policy for China today. Our Party is determined to fight to the end in accordance with this policy. I hope we can work together to achieve peace.

　　Respectfully, Mao Zedong

　　To the gentlemen of the Chongqing Christian Association Peace Prayer Meeting:

　　Your telegram has been received. I am deeply impressed by your concern for national affairs and your appeal for peace! Our Party has always advocated resolving all internal disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party through peaceful unity. Our Party's delegation in Nanjing proposed that both sides issue a clear order for a comprehensive, long-term, and unconditional ceasefire. However, a small number of warmongers still believe in resolving the issue through force, so the danger of civil war still exists. I hope we can work together to stop the war.

　　Mao Zedong
