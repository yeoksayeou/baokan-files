　　Organize to Get Rich
    Pingshun Production Exceeds Previous Years
    Proving that Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations is the Only Way to Achieve "Three Parts Farming, One Part Surplus."
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's advocated Wu Manyou direction, the farmers of Pingshun County are organizing to get rich. Li Shunda and 1,555 other labor heroes and production activists are the leading backbone of the county's production campaign. As early as the beginning of February this year, they had almost finished delivering manure. From April 11th to the end of April, in the 20 days, the county simultaneously conducted democratic county elections and launched a crash cotton planting campaign, exceeding the cotton planting task by 2,585 mu. The masses' slogan was: "Elect a new county head, plant more cotton, and enrich our families!" Next, they checked the spring plowing preparation work. After the inspection in Zhongwujing Village, a total of 12 plows, 24 harrows, 89 plowshares, and 15 manure buckets were added, increasing manure by 9 dan per mu. Since May, the county has universally promoted Li Shunda's direction, launched a crash planting campaign, and seized the opportunity to organize sideline production. In the short 20 days from planting to seedling thinning, District One added 43 small-scale cooperatives, and District Seven picked 54,320 jin of tea.
    In terms of transportation, three districts participated with a total of 5,038 laborers and 1,201 draft animals, earning 374,335 yuan. In terms of textiles, District One originally had 2,483 spinners, adding 605 spinners and 123 weavers. In April, a total of 1,306 jin of cotton were spun and 6,631 zhang of cloth were woven. Eggs in District One alone sold for 450,000 yuan. In District Five, 1,070 people in 14 villages earned 1,030,000 yuan by braiding straw hats. The total profit from sideline production in the county is estimated to be over 30 million yuan, exceeding last winter by 30 percent. Without sideline production, farmers cannot achieve a prosperous life. For example, raising chickens can solve the farmers' salt problem. Even during the busy farming season, the county can still spare 1,300 laborers to continue transportation. Their practical experience proves that Chairman Mao's policy of "taking agricultural production as the mainstay and combining it with handicrafts and sideline occupations" is completely correct. According to calculations, Pingshun's production this year exceeds previous years. In achieving the "three parts farming, one part surplus" goal, agricultural income accounts for 67 percent and sideline income accounts for 33 percent.

　　组织起来发家致富
    平顺生产超过往年
    证明农副业结合，才能达到耕三余一。
    【本报特讯】在毛主席提倡的吴满有方向指引下，平顺全县农民组织起来发家致富。以李顺达为首的一千五百五十五个劳动英雄和生产积极分子，是全县生产运动的领导骨干。远在今年二月初，他们即将粪送完，从四月十一到四月底二十天中间，该县一面进行民主县选，一面突击种棉，全县种棉超过任务二千五百八十五亩。群众的口号是：“选举新县长，多种棉花，把家闹富”。接着检查春耕准备工作，中五井村在检查后，共增加犁十二张，耢二十四个，铧八十九个，粪桶十五付，每亩增加粪九担。五月以来，该县普遍推广李顺达方向，突击下种，并抓紧空隙组织了副业生产，从下种到锄苗短短二十余天，一区即增加了小型合作社四十三个，七区采茶五万四千三百二十斤。
    在运输方面，三个区计参加人力五千零三十八人，畜力一千二百零一头，赚洋三十七万四千三百三十五元。在纺织方面，一区原有纺妇二千四百八十三个，增加六百零五个，织妇增加一百廿三个。四月共纺花一千三百零六斤，织布六千六百三十一丈。一区鸡蛋即卖洋四十五万元，五区十四个村一千零七十个人，辫草帽辫即赚洋一百零三万元，总计全县副业生产获利约在三千万以上，超过去冬百分之三十。没有副业生产，不能使农民达到富裕生活，比如养鸡可以解决农民吃盐问题。现在即使在农忙的季节全县亦可抽出一千三百个劳力继续保持运输。他们的实际经验证明，毛主席的以农业生产为主，把手工业、副业结合起来的方针，是完全正确的。根据计算今年平顺生产超过往年，在达到耕三余一的方针中，农业收入占百分之六十七，副业收入占百分之卅三。
