　　Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 23rd. 160,000 workers in the Bohai Liberation Area of Shandong began repairing dikes and controlling the Yellow River at the end of last month. Most of the work of repairing the damaged areas has been completed. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 1,471,550 cubic meters of earth were used, and 895,531 workdays were spent. A large number of labor models and model villages have emerged among the dike repair workers. The dikes on both banks of the Lijin River have been raised by two chi (approximately 2/3 of a meter) and widened by two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters). When repairing the Victory Bridge in the eastern district of the county, the transportation workers spontaneously proposed to protect the stone materials and three transportation models emerged. The Kuomintang reactionaries instigated special agents to spread rumors and sabotage, threatening the people in Xinghe and Jiyang not to work. They even shot and killed river management engineering personnel of the democratic government in Jiyang. The cavalry of the puppet army in Licheng also frequently invaded and attacked the masses repairing the river. However, the government and people of the Liberated Area are doing their best to build the repairs. It has been decided to raise the river embankment by one meter and the top width by three meters. The overall project will begin on a large scale at the end of the month.
　　(Delayed) Heze, 30th, this newspaper. Mr. Liu Jiqing, the representative of the Huang Commission stationed in the Bohai Liberation Area of Shandong, went to Jinan from Heze with Kong Lingrong, director of the Shandong Repair and Defense Office of the Huang Commission. He originally planned to return to the Bohai Liberation Area on the 10th with a part of the Huang River surveying equipment to implement the start of dike repairs. Unexpectedly, at noon on that day, the Jinan Kuomintang authorities dispatched special agents to simultaneously imprison Mr. Liu and three representatives of the Communist Party in the joint KMT-CPC Materials Committee, forcing them to be inspected, forcibly taking away reference books and stationery, and detaining a car brought by Mr. Liu. In the end, Mr. Liu was escorted to other places outside Jinan City. Fortunately, he encountered Fang Fu, the secretary of the Communist Party representative of the Jinan team, at the railway station and after making a serious protest to the Jinan Kuomintang authorities and after repeated difficulties and twists, Mr. Liu was able to escape alone and arrived in Tai'an. Now, the Jilu豫 Huang Commission has telegraphed the Kaifeng Huang Commission, making a solemn statement that the illegal and shameless behavior of the Jinan Kuomintang authorities has made it impossible for the Bohai District to complete the dike repairs and other projects as scheduled, and the Kuomintang should be responsible.

　　渤海十六万人复堤
    我该区黄委会代表竟遭国方无理扣留
    【新华社惠民二十三日电】山东渤海解放区十六万工人，于上月底即开工修堤治黄，补修残缺等工作已大部完成。据不完全统计，共用一、四七一、五五○方土，人工八九五、五三一工。修堤工人中涌现大批劳动模范与模范村。利津沿河两岸大堤，均加高二尺，加宽两丈。该县东区在修理胜利桥时，搬运工人自动提出爱护石料，并涌现三个搬运模范。国民党反动派指使特务造谣破坏，在醒河济阳一带威胁人民不准上工。在济阳并枪杀民主政府治河工程人员。历城伪军骑兵亦不时出犯，袭击修河群众。但解放区政府及人民，用全力进行修筑。决定河堤加高一公尺，顶宽三公尺。全面工程于月底即可大规模开始。
    【本报荷泽三十日电】（迟到）山东渤海解放区驻黄委会代表刘季青氏，前由荷泽会同黄委会山东修防处主任孔令熔抵济南后，本拟于十日携黄测量器材一部，返回渤海解放区，实施开工复堤，不料是日正午济南国民党当局，竟派遣特务将刘氏及国共合组之物资委员会中共代表三人同时分别监禁，威逼检查，将参考书籍文具等强行夺去，并将刘氏带去之汽车一部扣留，最后竟将刘氏押送往济南城外其他地点，幸在火车站与济南小组中共代表秘书房夫遭遇发现，经向济南国民党当局提出严重抗议，屡经留难波折，刘氏始得到只身脱险抵达泰安。现我冀鲁豫行黄委会已致电开封黄委会，严正声明，济南国民党当局此种非法无耻行为，致令渤海区复堤等工程无法如期完成，应由国民党方面负责。
