　　中共代表团向蒋抗议
    反对刺杀闻李血腥罪行
    要求撤销昆明卫戍司令限期缉凶
    【新华社延安二十一日电】南京讯：南京中共代表团十七日经过政协会议国民党代表，向蒋介石提出抗议，反对刺杀西南联大教授民主同盟中委闻一多与李公朴。抗议中指出：中共对于闻一多、李公朴的被刺，表示惋惜；对于此种血腥罪行，表示愤激。这的确是最野蛮最下贱的行为。在抗议书中历述三项要求：（１）应当马上撤销昆明卫戍司令的职务，限期缉捕凶手，政协会派遣自己的代表前往调查。（２）应当对死者举行公葬，对被难家属给予抚恤。（３）应当命令各地政府、军队与警察负责保护各党党员，与民主人士的安全。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】合众社华盛顿二十日电：国务院证实在中国民主同盟两位党员被暗杀后，美国驻昆明领事已允许该同盟十一位党员以避难所。国务院称：此项允许保护，是由于他们有被暗杀危险之显著可能性是存在的。
