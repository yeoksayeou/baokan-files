Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 12th: Paris dispatch: The Soviet representative at the Foreign Ministers' Conference put forward the preconditions for signing a treaty with Germany and the fundamental principles for future economic and political handling of Germany. The Soviet representative also proposed that a Foreign Ministers' Conference be held in the autumn of this year specifically to discuss the German question. On the afternoon of the 11th, the Foreign Ministers' Conference held a plenary session to discuss the German question in its entirety. The Soviet Union strongly advocated a unified Germany under a democratic government and opposed hypocritical federalization. The United States and Britain, on the other hand, advocated establishing a "German Federation" under a German central government. France held a different view, opposing any form of central government and opposing the incorporation of the Ruhr, Rhineland, and Saar into a future Germany. It is expected that the German question will continue to be discussed today. Regarding Byrnes' proposal to invite any one or all of the other three countries to establish economic ties between their respective occupied zones and the American occupied zone, there is closer consideration. Prior to this, economic ties between the four occupied zones of Germany were isolated. It is also reported that the four foreign ministers decided on the 9th to recommend to UN Secretary-General Lie that the opening date of the UN General Assembly be postponed from September 3rd to September 23rd. The foreign ministers also accepted Byrnes' suggestion and decided to organize a special committee to plan the international control mechanism for Trieste.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 12th: The main points of Molotov's statement on the German question on July 10th are as follows: Regarding the issue of a peace treaty with Germany, Molotov said: Before signing a peace treaty with Germany, a national German government must be established. The German government must be a democratic government, capable of eliminating all remnants of German fascism and fulfilling its obligations to the Allies, especially the obligation to pay reparations to the Allies. Only after such a government is established can the issue of signing a peace treaty be discussed. Regarding the handling of Germany's economic problems, Molotov pointed out that it must be based on considerations from all aspects, namely: (1) Germany's industry has become an important link in the world economic system; (2) German industry has been the basis of aggression more than once. Therefore, Molotov said: From the perspective of the economic interests of the world and Europe, it is incorrect to transform Germany into an agricultural country and to eliminate its important industries. Our task is not to eliminate Germany, but to transform it into a democratic and peace-loving country. In addition to agriculture, it also has its industry and foreign trade. At the same time, it is also necessary to eliminate the possibility of Germany's economic militarization and prevent the resurgence of German aggressive forces. Molotov went on to criticize many proposals that divide Germany into many autonomous states, or make Germany a federal state, or separate the Ruhr from Germany, etc. He pointed out that these proposals are based on the position of eliminating Germany or turning Germany into an agricultural country. He said: If the German people approve of federalism, we do not object, but we cannot force the German people to accept federalism. Without the Ruhr, Germany cannot become an independent and viable country, but in order to prevent the revival of German military industry, joint supervision of the Ruhr should be established by the four powers.

　　外长会议讨论德国问题
　  苏联提出基本方针
　　主张建立统一的德国民主政府并消灭其经济军事化的可能性
    【新华社延安十二日电】巴黎讯：苏联代表在外长会议上提出对德国签订和约的前提与今后在经济上、政治上处理德国的根本方针。苏代表并提议于今年秋后时期召开外长会议，专门讨论德国问题。十一日下午，外长会议举行全会，全部讨论德国问题，苏联力主有一个民主政府管理下统一的德国，反对虚伪的联邦化。而美英则主张在德国中央政府之下，成立“德国联邦”，法国则另持一端，反对任何形式的中央政府，反对将鲁尔、莱茵与萨尔划归未来的德国。预料今日将继续讨论德国问题。对于贝纳斯拟邀请其他三国中任何一国或全体，将各该国占领区与美国占领区建立经济联系一点，有较接近之考虑，在此以前，德境四占领区之间的经济联系是隔绝的。另悉：四外长于九日决定向联合国秘书长莱氏建议：联合国大会开会日期，应自九月三日延至九月二十三日。各外长并接受贝纳斯之建议，决定组织一特别委员会，俾筹划的里雅斯特之国际管制机构。
    【新华社延安十二电】七月十日莫洛托夫关于德国问题的声明，大要如下：关于对德和约问题，莫洛托夫说：在与德国签订和约之前，必须建立一全国性的德国政府。德国政府必须是一个民主的政府，能够消除德国法西斯主义的一切残余，能对盟国履行其义务，特别是对盟国偿付赔款的义务。只有这样的政府建立起来之后，才能谈到签订和约问题。关于处理德国经济问题，莫洛托夫指出必须根据各方面的考虑，即：（一）德国的工业已成为世界经济体系中重要的环节，（二）德国工业曾不止一次地成为侵略的基础。因此，莫洛托夫说：从世界和欧洲的经济利益看来，要把德国变成为农业国，要消灭其重要工业，是不正确的。我们的任务不在于消灭德国，而在于把它改造为民主的、爱好和平的国家。除了农业以外，还有其工业与对外贸易。同时，还必须消灭德国经济军事化的可能性，不使德国侵略势力有重新抬头的机会。莫洛托夫进而批评那些把德国划分为许多自治国，或使德国成为联邦国家，或把鲁尔与德国分开等等的许多方案。他指出这些提议都是从消灭德国，或把德国变为农业国的立场出发。他说：如果德国人民赞成联邦制，我们并不反对，但我们不能强迫德国人民接受联邦制。没有鲁尔，德国就不能成为独立的、有生存力的国家，但为了阻止德国军事工业的复活，应建立四强对鲁尔的共同监督。
