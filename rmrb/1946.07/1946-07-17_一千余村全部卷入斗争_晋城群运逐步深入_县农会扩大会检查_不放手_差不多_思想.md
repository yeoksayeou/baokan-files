　　More than a Thousand Villages All Involved in the Struggle
    The Mass Movement in Jincheng Gradually Deepens
    County Farmers' Association Expanded Meeting Examines "Not Letting Go" and "Good Enough" Thinking
    [Reported by this newspaper from Yangcheng] Since the launch of the rent reduction and debt clearing movement in Jincheng in March, as of early June, all 1,167 villages, large and small, in the county have been involved in the struggle, and farmers have generally obtained land in accordance with the law. 41,800 people have joined the Farmers' Association, and 10,000 have joined the militia. Currently, 14% of the villages in the county have already transitioned to the large-scale production movement; 32% of the villages have completed rent reduction and debt clearing and are in the process of calculating the total reckoning of their emancipation; 40% of the villages are in the midst of the upsurge of the rent reduction and debt clearing movement; and another 14% have launched movements against traitors and local bullies, half of which are mountain villages and settlements with very few households and people.
    [Another report] The Jincheng Farmers' Association held a meeting of more than 200 county and district cadres from early to mid-June, and reviewed the "not letting go" style of some cadres and "good enough" thinking. Regarding the style of work, everyone reviewed that under the general spirit of bold and unreserved action, individual comrades still retained many practices such as "taking over everything," "administrative orders," and "bestowing favors." Some comrades said when mobilizing the masses to pour out their grievances: "I know you've borrowed money, why don't you pour out your grievances? If you don't, you won't get any millet even if it's won through struggle!" Some said: "Tell me your grievances! I'll solve them for you." Everyone believed that this was not truly inspiring the masses to become conscious, but rather forcing them through external force. In essence, it was still taking over or bestowing favors. The second type was "releasing hands depending on the area." For example: "The environment in the city is complex, and people are too cunning. We can release hands in the villages, but not in the cities." The third type was "taking over for a while first, and then releasing hands boldly after things are set up." The result of doing so was that first, the activists replaced the masses, and then a few people acted recklessly, and the masses would not be mobilized at all. The fourth type was to "guide" first, so that the movement would not go beyond the subjectively set "big circle," which in practice restricted the masses' thinking and action. Finally, examining "good enough" thinking, everyone believed that in the past, they had taken the issue of rent and interest too simply. In reality, the masses' ideological awareness had not been raised, and the issue of rent and interest might not have been completely resolved, but we simply did not have enough understanding of the actual situation. An activist from Xia Chen Village criticized the cadres, saying: "You are neither a landlord nor a farmer, so you don't know the dealings between landlords and farmers." This was a very accurate hit. Comrade Zheng Siyuan of the county party committee said in summarizing this issue: "Everyone should not subjectively create standards or conclusions for mobilizing the masses first. It is best to go to the masses and let the farmers calculate their own emancipation accounts to see if they have truly been emancipated and whether the land issue has been completely resolved."

### 一千余村全部卷入斗争  晋城群运逐步深入  县农会扩大会检查“不放手”“差不多”思想

　　一千余村全部卷入斗争
    晋城群运逐步深入
    县农会扩大会检查“不放手”“差不多”思想
    【本报阳城讯】晋城自三月份发动减租清债运动以来，截至六月上旬全县大小村庄一千一百六十七个，全部卷入了斗争，农民普遍依法获得了土地。有四万一千八百人涌入农会，一万人参加民兵。现全县有百分之十四的村庄已经转入大生产运动；百分之三十二的村庄减租清债已结束，正在算翻身总账；百分之四十的村庄正在减租清债运动的热潮中；另有百分之十四掀起了反奸，反恶霸运动，其中有一半是户数人口都很少的山庄、窝铺。
    【又讯】晋城农会于六月上旬至中旬召开二百多县区干部的会议，曾检讨部分干部的“不放手”作风与“差不多”思想等问题。关于作风问题，大家检讨到：在总的大胆放手精神下，个别同志仍保留着不少“包办代替”、“行政命令”与“恩赐”等作法。有的同志在发动群众诉苦时说：“我知道你贷过账，你为啥不诉苦呢？你要不诉，斗争出小米来更没你的！”有的说：“你诉吧！诉出来我给你解决。”大家认为这都不是真正启发群众自觉，而是用外力硬拖硬推。实质上仍是包办、或恩赐。第二种是“放手要看地区”。比方说：“城里环境复杂，人太滑头，村里能放手，城里不能放手”。第三种是“先包办代替一下，弄起来以后再大胆放手。”这样做的结果，先是积极分子代替群众，然后是少数人蛮干，群众根本不会发动起来。第四种是先“诱导”一下，使运动出不了主观设定的“大圈圈”实际是束缚群众思想与行动。最后检查“差不多”思想大家认为过去把租息问题看得太简单，实际上群众思想觉悟没有提高，租息问题也就未必解决彻底，只是我们对实际情况了解不够罢了。下町村一个积极分子批评干部说：“你不是地主，也不是农民，你就不知道地主和农民的来往。”这是打得很中的。该县县委郑思远同志在总结这一问题时说：“大家不要主观上先自造发动群众的标准或结论，最好到群众中去，让农民自己计算一下他们的翻身账，看到底翻身了没有，土地问题彻底解决了没有。”
