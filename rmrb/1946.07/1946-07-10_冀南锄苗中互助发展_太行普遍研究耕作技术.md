　　Mutual Aid Develops in Weeding in Southern Hebei
    Intensive Research into Farming Techniques in Taihang
    [Report from this newspaper in Weixian] After the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement in various parts of Southern Hebei, the peasant masses have entered the weeding movement with excitement. The first weeding was completed before the wheat harvest, and the second weeding is now in full swing. In the weeding process, everyone gradually experienced the benefits of mutual aid in saving labor, and mutual aid groups have developed rapidly. Li Fajia's mutual aid group in Jiudian Village, First District, Feixiang, weeded 174 mu in twelve days, saving 32 labor days and weeding 48 mu more land. Cui Jialu's mutual aid group in Xixiafang Village, Second District, Qiu County, saved eight labor days. Xiao Shengniang, a model worker in Youhe Village, Third District, Quzhou, led her family to the fields and has now completed the second weeding. In the Second District of Guan County, 70 mutual aid groups were organized in eleven villages during the wheat harvest. In the Second District of Qinghe, among 63 villages, 121 villages established 51 mutual aid groups and 33 textile groups. After the weeding began in Kangjiazhuang, Northwest Sub-district, not a single idler could be seen on the streets. The mutual aid groups have developed to 12 groups, and three groups can often help each other. The Xie Likui group in the village helps each other not only in farming but also in making adobe for mud houses. In Jize, 148 villages organized 2,115 mutual aid groups, and in the First District of Qiu County, the number of mutual aid groups has grown to 372.
    [Report from this newspaper] The principle of improving and enhancing technology, deep plowing, and careful cultivation to achieve the goal of "tilling three and saving one" to ensure increased production has aroused widespread attention among farmers in the Taihang area. In early June, Wangzhuang Village, Pingshun, convened a technical committee to study how to weed and reviewed the shortcomings of last year's weeding, which was either too dense or too sparse, and not thorough enough, resulting in less grain being harvested. After the meeting, the village selected eight skilled farmers to work with the technical committee to provide direct guidance in the fields. Each village in Licheng has a technical guidance committee, and mutual aid brigades have technical teams. Some villages held forums for veteran farmers to study how to apply manure, make manure, eliminate pests, and plant cotton. The insect-catching movement has also been widely carried out in various counties. Women and children in Linbei universally carried out the movement to catch "Cangzhu" (a kind of beetle), protecting the seedlings. In Licheng, "Hei Popo" (another kind of insect) was caught everywhere. The county caught 2,249 jin of insects, which, if not caught, would have eaten crops on 1,460 mu. Li Mabao in Wuxiang organized semi-laborers to dig up weeds along the edges of the fields for encirclement and suppression. The agricultural and forestry conference held by the Administrative Office in mid-March and the agricultural technology training classes held in various places were important links in promoting farmers' attention to farming techniques and preventing diseases and pests. The Lucheng Agricultural Technology Training Class trained 359 cadres.

　　冀南锄苗中互助发展
    太行普遍研究耕作技术
    【本报威县讯】冀南各地经减租增资运动，农民群众均以兴奋之情进入锄苗运动，头遍在麦收前已完成，二锄现正在突击中。在锄苗中大家逐渐体验到互助省工的好处，互助组获得迅速发展。肥乡一区旧店村李发甲互助组，在十二天内锄苗一百七十四亩，省工三十二个，多锄了四十八亩地。邱县二区西下方村崔家禄互助组省工八天。曲周三区油贺村劳动模范小生娘，带领全家下地，现已完成二遍锄。冠县二区在麦收时十一个村组织了七十个互助组。清河二区六十三个村，有十二一个村建立了五十一个互助组、三十三个纺织组。西北小区康家庄锄苗开始后，街上看不见一个闲人，互助组已发展到十二组，三个组能经常互助，该村谢立魁组除耕作互助外，还互助脱坯泥房。鸡泽一百四十八村，组织了二千一百十五个互助组，邱县一区发展到三百七十二个互助组。
    【本报讯】改良与提高技术，深耕细作以达到耕三余一保证增产的方针，已在太行区农民中，引起了普遍的注意。平顺王庄村于六月初旬召开了技术委员会，研究如何锄苗，检讨了去年锄苗的缺点，不是稠便是稀，锄的不透，少收了粮食，会后该村并选拔八个把式，配合技术委员会，到地里直接指导。黎城各村都设有技术指导委员会，互助大队设有技术组，有的村举行了老农座谈会，分别研究了怎样施粪、造粪、消灭害虫，以及种棉花等问题。捉虫运动也普遍的在各县开展，林北妇女儿童普遍进行了捉“苍珠”运动，保卫了花苗。黎城到处捕捉“黑婆婆”。全县捉虫二二四九斤，如不捉就吃掉庄稼一四六○亩。武乡李马保组织了半劳力挖掉地边荒草进行围剿。三月中旬行署举行的农林会议和各地农业技术训练班的举办，则是推动农民注意耕作技术，防止病害虫的重要环节。潞城农业技术训练班，训练了三百五十九个干部。
