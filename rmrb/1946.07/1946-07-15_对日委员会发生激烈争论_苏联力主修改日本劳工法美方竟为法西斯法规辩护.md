Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 11th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo, a fierce debate occurred at the Allied Council for Japan meeting today regarding the revision of Japanese labor law. The Soviet representative, based on the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and taking into account the current political situation in Japan and the development of the workers' movement, proposed twenty-two amendments to the existing fascist Japanese labor law that would meet the demands of Japanese workers and specifically guarantee labor welfare. However, the chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, U.S. representative Atcheson, vehemently defended the current Japanese labor law. Atcheson said, "We did not guarantee to implement communism in Japan; on the contrary, we guaranteed to implement democratic principles. Communism and fascism should not lead labor." He used this as a reason to resolutely oppose the Soviet representative's proposals. According to the current Japanese labor law, it was molded by war criminal Tojo based on the Nazi's total mobilization law after the Pacific War and does not contain any "democratic principles." Regarding Atcheson's slander, Soviet representative Derevyanko pointed out that Atcheson's words were of an intentionally inflammatory nature and said, "Please Mr. Atcheson visit the Soviet Union and take a look there, in order to properly understand what is meant by 'labor organization'." British representative Bower was also disgusted by Atcheson's remarks and refuted Atcheson's slander of the Soviet representative, saying, "I cannot see any signs of promoting communism in the Soviet representative's speech."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 12th: According to a United Press dispatch, Japanese Communist Party spokesman Ito issued a statement refuting the remarks made by MacArthur's representative Atcheson at the Allied Council for Japan meeting on Wednesday. Ito stated, "We find it difficult to understand why such a view would be conceived, namely that so-called communism will perish, and labor will rise up. What makes it most difficult for the Communist Party is that the Potsdam Declaration is being interpreted and criticized from a purely bourgeois perspective with the same view as fascism. Suppressing spontaneous mass movements will harm the Japanese people." The Communist Party also announced a land reform plan, demanding the uncompensated confiscation of landlords' land. The plan authorizes farmer representatives and denies government officials from implementing land reform. The spokesman said, "The purpose of formulating the plan is to eliminate all feudal elements in the land system in rural areas and promote the rapid development of agricultural production."

　　对日委员会发生激烈争论
　  苏联力主修改日本劳工法美方竟为法西斯法规辩护
    【新华社延安十一日电】据路透社东京讯：对日委员会于是日会议上，发生关于修改日本劳工法的激烈争论。苏联代表根据波茨顿宣言的精神，综观日本目前政治形势与工人运动的发展，提出二十二点符合日本工人要求，具体保证劳工福利的修改日本现行法西斯劳工法的建议，可是对日委员会的主席，美国代表艾契森，却竭力为日本现行劳工法辩护。艾契森说：“我们并没有保证要在日本实行共产主义，相反地，我们保证要实行的是民主主义原则，共产主义与法西斯主义应不领导劳工。”他以此为理由，坚决反对苏联代表的建议，按日本现行劳工法，是太平洋战争后战犯东条依据纳粹的总动员法所塑造的统治，没有一点“民主主义的原则”。对艾氏的诋毁，苏代表德勒维扬哥指出艾契森的话是属于有意煽动的性质，并说：“请艾契森先生到苏联去参观，在那里看看，以便正当地了解所谓劳工组织”。英方代表鲍尔，也对艾契森的发言引起反感，驳斥艾契森对苏联代表的诋毁道：“我从苏联代表的发言中，看不出有任何宣传共产主义的迹象”。
    【新华社延安十二日电】据合众社电称：日本共产党发言人伊藤发表谈话，驳斥麦克阿瑟代表艾契森在盟国对日委员会星期三会上之发言。伊藤称：“我们觉得很难了解，为什么会想出这种见解，即所谓共产主义将灭亡，而劳工将兴起。使共产党最感困难的，是波茨顿宣言竟被以单纯资产阶级的观点与法西斯相同看法去解释而且加以批评。把自发的群众运动加以压制，其结果会损害日本人民”。共产党并宣布土地改革计划，要求无报偿的没收，地主土地，该计划授权由农民代表而否认政府官员实施土地改革。该发言人称：“制订计划之目的，在于消灭乡村中的土地制度中的一切封建因素，促使农业生产迅速发展。”
