　　Reading Zhang Xueliang's Recent Works
    Tian Han
    A guest came from Xifeng, bringing with him two recent poems by General Zhang, truly pure and delightful. General Zhang has been held for ten years. Various parties have called for the release of political prisoners, but General Zhang has not even been classified as a political prisoner. Instead, he is said to be dealt with by "family law." For ten years, over a hundred people have been assigned to monitor the General's family and those around him. The General's daily routine consists of fishing and gardening. In the evenings, he diligently studies under the dim light of a vegetable oil lamp, which has also damaged his eyesight, causing this man in his prime to wear reading glasses. The General's military remonstrance was a direct driving force for the sacred War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has been won, the civil war in the Northeast continues unabated, with countless lives lost. General Zhang, confined in Xifeng, is powerless to do anything. How profound are his feelings!
    A certain gentleman recently passed through Xifeng, bringing much news of the General: He diligently studies the "Records of the Grand Historian" by lamplight, and his writings often turn into folk songs. Forced to tend the garden, it is not by choice, but like Jiang Ziya fishing, filled with sorrow and frustration. One can only wonder, on the day of victorious repatriation, what will become of this long-imprisoned hero?

　　读张学良近作
    田汉
    客有从息烽来者，带来张将军近作新诗两首，真纯可喜。将军被覆盖十年矣，各方呼吁释放政治犯，将军甚至未被归入政治犯之列。而谓以“家法”处之，十年以来监视将军一家及其左右者闻达百余人。将军以钓鱼种菜为其日常功课，晚间在菜油灯下读书精进，亦以此损害其目力，壮年之身御老光镜。将军之兵谏实为神圣抗战之直接推动力。今抗战胜利而东北内战不已，杀人盈野，将军羁系息烽无以为力，其为感慨何如也！
    某公近从息烽过，带来将军消息多：挑灯辛勤读史记，下笔辄复成民歌。使对学圃岂得已，子牙垂纶悲蹉跎。独疑胜利复员日，长系壮士将如何？
