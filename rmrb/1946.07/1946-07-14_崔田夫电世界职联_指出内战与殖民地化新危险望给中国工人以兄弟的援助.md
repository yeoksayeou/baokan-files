　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 11th: Cui Tianfu, acting director of the Preparatory Committee of the Liberated Areas Federation of Trade Unions, telegraphed the Executive Committee Enlarged Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions the day before yesterday, pointing out that China is encountering new dangers of civil war and new dangers of colonialization, and requesting the meeting to discuss the situation in China and give Chinese workers brotherly assistance. The original telegram is as follows:

　　To Zhu Xuefan and Liu Ningyi, Chinese worker representatives to the Executive Committee Enlarged Meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Moscow, for the perusal of all executive committee members:

　　As you are meeting in Moscow, the Chinese working class is encountering enormous disasters. The danger of large-scale civil war and the danger of new colonialization are seriously threatening us! The source of this danger is the American imperialist elements and the Chinese fascist reactionaries. The Chinese fascist reactionaries betray national sovereignty in exchange for the continuous assistance of American imperialists. They are implementing a Hitler-style and Japanese-style fascist system in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and carrying out an anti-people civil war. American imperialist elements, under the pretext of "aid to China," are doing everything possible to help the fascist reactionaries within the Kuomintang to carry out civil war, stationing troops in China for a long time, and are turning China into a colony and a military base for international aggression. This situation threatens world peace, and the Chinese workers and the Chinese people are the first to suffer disasters. The workers in the liberated areas of China are uniting with the people of the liberated areas and the people of the whole country to fight against civil war, against national betrayal, against dictatorship, and against foreign armed intervention! We request the Executive Committee Enlarged Meeting to discuss the situation in China and give Chinese workers brotherly help! We extend our warm respects and wish the Executive Committee Enlarged Meeting success!

　　Cui Tianfu, Acting Head of the Preparatory Committee of the Trade Union Federation of the Liberated Areas of China, July 9th.

　　崔田夫电世界职联
　  指出内战与殖民地化新危险
　　望给中国工人以兄弟的援助
    【新华社延安十一日电】解放区职工联合会筹备会代理主任崔田夫，前日致电世界职工联合会执委扩大会议，指出：中国正遇到了新的内战危险和新的殖民地化危险，请求该会讨论中国的形势，给中国工人以兄弟的援助。原电如下：
    莫斯科世界职工联合会执委扩大会议中国职工代表朱学范、刘宁一转全体执委公鉴：
    当你们在莫斯科开会的时候，中国工人阶级正遇到了巨大的灾难，大规模内战的危险和新的殖民地化的危险，严重的威胁着我们！这种危险的来源，是美国的帝国主义分子和中国法西斯反动派。中国的法西斯反动派出卖国家主权，换得美国帝国主义者的不断援助。在国民党统治区域实现希特勒式和日本式的法西斯制度，并进行反人民的内战。美国帝国主义分子则以“援华”为借口，尽情帮助国民党内法西斯反动派进行内战，长期驻兵中国，并正在把中国化为殖民地，化为国际侵略的军事基地。这种情形，威胁着世界和平，而中国工人与中国人民，则首先受到灾难。中国解放区的工人，正与解放区的人民及全国人民联合起来，为了反对内战、反对卖国、反对独裁、反对外国武装干涉而斗争！我们请求职委会扩大会讨论中国的形势，给中国工人以兄弟的帮助！谨致热烈的敬意，祝执委会扩大会的成功！
    中国解放区职工联合会筹备会代理班崔由夫，七月九日。
