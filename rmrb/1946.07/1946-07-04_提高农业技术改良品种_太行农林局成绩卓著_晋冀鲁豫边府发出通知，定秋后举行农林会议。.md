　　Improving Agricultural Technology and Breeding Better Varieties
    Remarkable Achievements of the Taihang Agricultural and Forestry Bureau. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government Issues a Notice to Hold an Agricultural and Forestry Conference After the Autumn Harvest.
    [Report from Changzhi by this newspaper] The Changzhi, Zuoquan, Linxian, and Xingtai Agricultural and Forestry Bureaus, which are under the Taihang Administrative Office's Construction Department, have been actively reorganizing since the spring Agricultural and Forestry Bureau meeting. They have now taken initial shape and have achieved remarkable results in improving agricultural technology. The Changzhi Bureau's farm planted 751 mu this spring and is conducting crop experiments. Approximately 200 varieties are being tested. The millet yield comparison test has been conducted for four consecutive years, and preliminary results will be published this year. Promoting cotton planting is one of the main tasks of each bureau. All four bureaus held short-term cotton planting training classes this spring. During the cotton seed selection period, each bureau sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to provide guidance. Currently, the Xingtai Bureau has distributed 45 boxes of insecticide powder and 54 sprayers to eliminate cotton seedling pests. The Changzhi Bureau's nursery distributed 50,000 tree seedlings during the spring tree planting season. The Linxian Bureau operated a ten-mu nursery in Cixian County, sowing fruit tree seeds. The Xingtai Bureau's 70-mu nursery has been completely renovated and will be able to distribute at least 200,000 tree seedlings next spring. This spring, it has already distributed 100,000 tomato seedlings. In addition, the Changzhi Bureau hatched over a hundred Leghorn chickens, and the Xingtai Bureau propagated thirteen boxes of Italian bees.
    [Report by this newspaper] The Border Region Government recently issued a notice deciding to hold an agricultural and forestry conference after the autumn harvest to strengthen the region's agricultural and forestry work, exchange production technologies from various regions, and share organizational experience. The notice instructs all regions to pay attention to collecting improved agricultural tools, rural sideline products, and various disease and pest specimens as soon as possible, understand the masses' demands for agricultural and forestry work, and summarize the experience of mutual aid and cooperation.
