　　UN Relief Representatives Believe:
    The Kuomintang Created Many Difficulties for Relief Work
    Blockades Prevented Relief from Reaching Liberated Areas
    [Handan, 20th Dispatch] The Jinnan Administrative Office previously sent Comrades Han Wei and Su Qun as representatives of the people of 12 counties in Shandong, including Linqing and Qiuxian, to Linyi to discuss relief matters with representatives of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). They returned earlier this month. Our reporter recently interviewed them, and they made the following statements:
    "During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of the 12 counties in Shandong under the jurisdiction of the Jinnan District suffered heavy losses. According to investigations, the enemy and puppets seized, requisitioned, or burned a total of 108.8 million catties of grain, 25 million catties of cotton, more than 67,000 large and small carts, 180,000 head of livestock, and more than 3.3 million houses were burned or demolished. Currently, a total of 226,000 people are in urgent need of relief. Qiuxian, Tangyi, Guanxian and other counties under the rule of puppet army Qi Zixiu created a large no-man's land. According to investigations in 36 villages: "1,170 people were killed or injured, 6,500 people fled or were captured, more than 2,700 head of livestock were lost, 4,109,000 catties of grain were forcibly requisitioned, and 8,300 houses were burned. We have made detailed representations of these significant losses to Mr. Qi Hefu, the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration." "The results of the discussion determined the establishment of a three-person committee, composed of representatives from both the UNRRA and the Relief Committee of the Liberated Areas, responsible for the relief affairs of the 12 liberated counties of Shandong. The UNRRA representative sent people to our liberated areas to investigate the disaster situation. When discussing the difficulties of relief work, Comrade Han Wei quoted Mr. Qi Hefu as saying: "The Kuomintang has created many difficulties for UNRRA in carrying out relief work in Shandong Province." Mr. Qi expressed that the people of the Shandong Liberated Areas "should submit written protests to the Kuomintang government, Chiang Kai-shek, and He Siyuan and Wang Yaowu of Shandong" regarding the Kuomintang's delay in relief. "Finally, we once again expressed our hope that the three-person committee could start work immediately and warmly welcome the UNRRA representatives to visit our liberated areas to investigate the disaster situation." On the way back, in Jintan Town, our representatives happened to meet Mr. Balif, from the UNRRA headquarters, and Mr. Gan Yian, from the Kaifeng branch. Mr. Balif and Mr. Gan stated: "The reason why the liberated areas have not received relief is due to the Kuomintang government's multiple blockades and obstructions, and this time we must bring the opinions back."

　　联总代表认为：
    国民党给救济工作许多困难       
    封锁阻挠使解放区未获救济
    【邯郸二十日电】冀南行署，前派韩韦、苏群两同志代表临清、邱县等山东十二县人民赴临沂与联总代表商谈救济事宜，现已于本月初返回，本社记者顷特往访，承发表谈话如下：
    “在八年抗战中，冀南区所属山东十二县人民损失惨重。据调查：粮食被敌伪抢去、强征、烧毁者共达十万万八千余万斤，棉花二千五百万斤，大小车六万七千余辆，牲口十八万头，房屋被烧毁、拆掉三百三十余万间，目前急待救济者总计二十二万六千余人。邱县、堂邑、冠县等县在伪军齐子修统治下，造成了广大的无人区，据三十六个村调查：“人民被杀伤一千一百七十人，逃亡及被抓六千五百人，牲口损失二千七百余头，粮食被强征四百一十万九千斤，房屋被烧八千三百间。这些重大损失，我们均已向联合救济总署代表齐贺福先生作了详细陈述”。“商谈结果确定成立一个三人委员会，由联总和解放区救委会各出代表组成，负责山东十二县解放区救济事宜，联总代表曾派人赴我解放区考查灾情。谈到救济工作困难时，韩韦同志引用齐贺福先生的话说：“山东省进行救济工作，国民党曾给联总很多困难”。齐先生对于国民党拖延救济，山东解放区人民表示：“应向国民党政府蒋介石及山东何思源、王耀武提出书面抗议。”“最后我方再次表示希望三人委员会，能立即开始工作，热烈欢迎联总代表赴我解放区考查灾情”。在归途中于金滩镇，我方代表适遇联总总署巴力夫先生及开封分署甘一安先生。巴、甘二先生表示：“解放区未得到救济是因国民党政府多方封锁阻挠，此次一定要把意见带回去”。
