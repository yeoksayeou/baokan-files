　　Kuomintang Uses Relief Supplies as a Political Tool
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th】US News Service reports: LaGuardia, Director-General of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (former Mayor of New York City and a left-wing member of the American Labor Party), announced on the 9th that all UNRRA industrial and agricultural equipment shipments to China would be suspended immediately. According to LaGuardia, the distribution of UNRRA supplies in mainland China was not considered satisfactory. He also stated that essential relief grains would continue to be shipped to China, but only on the condition that the Chinese government quickly clears all ports and that the Executive Yuan distributes relief supplies to the Chinese mainland in a satisfactory manner.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th】Moscow Radio announced today: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai, 250 of the 400 staff members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Shanghai branch sent a telegram to Director-General LaGuardia, blaming the Chinese government for using UNRRA supplies as a political tool.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th】Shanghai reports: Large quantities of American condensed milk and milk powder are being dumped on the Shanghai market. According to customs figures, Shanghai imported over 430,000 kilograms of condensed milk and milk powder in April of this year, worth approximately 370 million yuan. In addition, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration shipped approximately 3,650,000 kilograms of relief condensed milk and milk powder to Shanghai, worth approximately 33.8 billion yuan. The total of the two amounts to 37.5 billion yuan. Due to the dumping of American milk powder, domestic milk powder and dairy industries are finding it impossible to sustain their business. Fresh milk companies recently prepared to drive all their dairy cows into the streets to parade and petition, but the demonstration was suppressed by the authorities and did not take place.

    【新华社延安十二日电】美新闻处讯：联合国善后救济总署署长拉瓜第亚（曾任纽约市长，为美劳工党左翼分子之一）九日宣布，自即日起，联总一切工业与农业设备停止运华。据拉氏称：联总物资在中国内地之分配情形，不能认为满意。并谓：重要之救济谷物等，仍继续运华，但必以中国政府迅速出清各口岸，及行总将救济物资运至中国内地，以满意方法分配为条件。
    【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科今日广播：据美联社上海讯：联合国善后救济总署上海分署四百工作人员中，有二百五十人致电总署署长拉瓜第亚，归罪中国政府利用联总物资，作为政治工具。
    【新华社延安十二日电】沪讯：大量美国炼乳、牛奶粉正向沪市倾销。据海关发表数字，本年四月份沪市进口炼乳、牛奶粉达四十三万余公斤，约值三万七千万元。又联合国善后救济总署运沪救济之炼乳、牛奶粉约三百六十五万余公斤，约值三十三万万八千万元。二者合计，竟达三十七万万五千万元。由于美国奶粉倾销，国产奶粉与牛奶业均感无法维持营业。各鲜牛奶公司近曾一度准备将所蓄乳牛全部驱上街头游行请愿，后为当局镇压，游行未成。
