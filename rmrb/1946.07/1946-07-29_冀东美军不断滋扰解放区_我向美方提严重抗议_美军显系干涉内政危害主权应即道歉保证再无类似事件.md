Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, July 25th: US troops stationed for a long time along the Beining Railway, in addition to actively helping Chiang Kai-shek transport troops, "protect the railway," garrison mines, and guard seaports to fuel the Chinese civil war, have also directly and openly carried out multiple provocations and disturbances against the liberated areas. General Zhan Cai, Commander of the Eastern Hebei Military Region of the Eighth Route Army, General Bi Zhanyun, Deputy Commander, and General Li Chuli, Political Commissar, in order to safeguard national sovereignty and protect the lives and property of the people, sent an urgent telegram to General Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, at 6:00 AM on the 17th of this month, requesting him to forward it to the three members of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, lodging a serious protest to the US military authorities. They listed the provocative acts of the US military in the Eastern Hebei liberated area in the past month: (1) On June 10th, four US soldiers from Linxi on the Beining line, in a car, passed through Maojiashan, Zhao Zhuangzi, Anjialou to Jiubaihu Village in Luan County, taking photographs and conducting reconnaissance along the way, and setting up a radio station in Jiubaihu Village for communication. Our side's dissuasion was ineffective. (2) On the 16th, four US soldiers from Tangshan caused disturbances in Daodizhen, Songjiaying and other places. (3) On July 11th, more than ten US soldiers and three tanks from Bridge No. 52 on the Beining Railway demonstrated in the Sanhezhuangzi area of Luan County, destroying countless of our crops. (4) On July 13th, seven US soldiers stationed in Liushouying invaded Xihenan Village in the fourth district of Changli and opened fire on our local militiamen. The militiamen rose up in self-defense and detained them. Just as negotiations were underway, US troops and Chiang's troops from Liushouying surged in again. In order to avoid escalating the situation, our militiamen withdrew voluntarily. (5) On July 14th, more than 150 US soldiers from Qinhuangdao and Liushouying, coordinated by four aircraft, invaded the Qiuying area of the fourth district of Changli and harassed the area. (6) On the 15th, two ships set out from Qinhuangdao, carrying more than 50 US soldiers, landed at Chiyangkou in Changli, and under the cover of aircraft, invaded the Chahezhuang and Niejiazhuang areas in the fourth district. On the 17th, more than a thousand US-Chiang-puppet allied forces from Changli marched south in a large scale, invading Nijing and Shigezhuang, 20 li south of Changli, and then invading Liujiazhuang and Tuanlinzhen. As for the US aircraft's reconnaissance and demonstrations, they have never ceased. From July 9th to 16th, more than ten US aircraft or American-style aircraft with Kuomintang emblems demonstrated and circled in Lulong, Leting, Changli, Zunhua, Qian'an and other places. The protest pointed out that this kind of action by the US military is clearly an interference in China's internal affairs, endangering China's sovereignty, and in fact, sheltering and helping the Kuomintang authorities in the civil war. The US side should immediately make a formal apology and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. Otherwise, if the situation escalates, the US side should be responsible for the consequences. It is reported that this protest has been formally telegraphed to the Beiping Executive Headquarters by General Nie Rongzhen.
