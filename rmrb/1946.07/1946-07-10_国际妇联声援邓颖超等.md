Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th: The International Federation of Democratic Women's Executive Committee is greatly displeased that Deng Yingchao and other representatives of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China were denied passports by the government, preventing them from attending the International Federation of Women's Executive Committee meeting. They specifically sent a telegram to Deng on the 2nd to express their support. The original telegram is as follows:

Ms. Deng Yingchao, Nanjing:

The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation expresses its deep regret that your government has refused to issue passports for your federation to travel abroad. To this end, we have contacted your country's embassy in Paris to work together to obtain passports so that your country's representatives can come to Paris to report on the situation of Chinese women to the Women's Federation. Please continue to negotiate in order to ensure the issuance of passports. To guarantee peace and democracy, women around the world must cooperate. Chinese women have suffered so much and struggled for the safety of the country and have the right to participate in the establishment of peace. The Executive Committee expresses its enthusiasm for unity and cooperation to your representatives and the 20 million women of your federation.

The Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation
