　　[This newspaper's dispatch] From April to June, a large number of emancipated peasant activists from advanced villages in Gaoyi, led by district cadres, went to help peasants in nearby backward villages carry out the struggle for emancipation. They were familiar with the situation of the masses and had kinship ties, often discovering various problems faster than the district cadres. The district cadres then helped them study various situations and problems, devising sound solutions, which quickly opened up the situation in the backward villages and launched struggles against traitors and despots. The Third District was close to Yuanshi, and everyone braved dangers, forming their own armed groups to both combat the armed disturbances of special agents and protect the mass movement, and to help the masses work in the fields. They also quickly discovered problems and launched mass struggles. Now, out of 100 villages in the county, except for three villages where there is no mass movement yet, 69 villages have launched struggles against traitors (of which 37 villages are turning to rent reduction); another 19 villages are reducing rent, and 9 villages have entered into large-scale production. More than 93,000 people have participated in the movement.
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] After our army liberated De County and other places, the people in the vast areas east of the Grand Canal demanded to be organized to carry out the struggle for emancipation. Seventy-two village and district cadres and emancipated peasant activists from the Fifth Sub-district of Jinnan, under the call of their superiors, voluntarily signed up to form an expeditionary force to go to Yundong to help local peasants emancipate themselves. They gathered in Hengshui from the 17th to the 21st of last month to study current affairs and land policies, and to review and summarize their work experience, such as good methods in mass communication, deliberation, and struggle reasoning. Their slogan is to unite with the local cadres in Yundong and work together to mobilize the masses to overthrow the feudal mountains, and to overthrow the traitors, special agents, local bullies, evil gentry, and the people's rule. Their morale is extremely high. Lang Fengren, a representative of hired laborers from Duyan, Zaoqiang, in order to go to Yundong, paid out of his own pocket to hire a short-term worker for his master. He said: "Helping the masses in Yundong to emancipate themselves, even if I don't earn wages this year, I am willing to do it!"

　　高邑集中突击落后村冀南组织翻身远征军
    【本报讯】四月至六月，高邑先进村大批翻身农民积极分子，由区干部率领，纷往帮助附近落后村农民进行翻身斗争。他们熟悉群众情况，有亲友关系，时常比区干部更快的发现各种问题。区干部则帮助他们研究各种情况与问题，想出完善办法，这样很快打开了落后村的局面，掀起反奸霸等斗争。三区靠近元氏，大家不避艰险，自己组成武装小组，一面打击特务的武装扰乱，保卫群运，一面帮群众在地里做活，也很快发现问题，开展了群众斗争。现在全县一百村，除三村尚无群众运动外，有六十九村都掀起反奸斗争（其中三十七村正转向减租）；另有十九个村在减租，九村进入大生产。参加运动的九万三千多人。
    【本报讯】我军解放德县等地后，运河以东广大地区人民要求组织起来，进行翻身斗争。我冀南五分区村区干部与翻了身的农民积极分子七十二人，在上级号召下，自动报名组成远征军，前往运东，帮助当地农民翻身。他们曾于上月十七到廿一日集中衡水，学习时事与土地政策，检讨总结工作经验，如群众串通、酝酿、斗争说理中好的办法，他们的口号是要与运东本地干部团结起来，共同努力发动群众打垮封建大山，打垮汉奸特务、豪绅、恶霸分子与人民的统治，他们情绪都极高涨，枣强杜烟雇工代表郎凤仁，为了到运东，自己出钱给东家雇用短工。他说：“帮助运东群众翻身，今年挣不上工钱，我也情愿干！”
