Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 3rd. Over seventy foreign nationals and merchants from various countries including Greece, France, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Jewish people in Yantai, including Mi Zhenduo, Giesder, Bardis, Bartonke, and Segnel, wrote articles to congratulate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, stating: "What makes foreigners particularly happy is that the heroic Eighth Route Army liberated Yantai from the brutal and barbaric shackles of the Japanese invaders, and the democratic government will provide care and assistance to all foreigners and Catholic Church charitable undertakings. The officers and soldiers of the Eighth Route Army are disciplined and provide proper protection to all levels of people, which deserves our heartfelt gratitude."

Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 3rd. The masses of Jimingyi Village, Huailai (next to the Ping-Sui Railway), after their great liberation, held a village-wide gathering before "July 1st" to celebrate the 25th birthday of the CCP, and wrote a dozen letters to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party expressing their gratitude. Zhu Xiangxin, a tenant farmer for generations, wrote: "I am a poor man. My parents did not leave me any property, and my blood and sweat were squeezed dry by those evil landlords and wealthy people. The Communist Party helped us poor people acquire land and told us how to live a good life through production. My whole family is happy beyond words." An old farmer reported on his rising fortunes, saying: "In the past, I rented 14.5 mu of land from the landlord, harvested 15 shi of grain, and had to pay 8 shi and 4 dou as rent. I also had to pay the Japanese devils public grain and expenses. When I borrowed grain from others, they wouldn't even acknowledge me. Now, we have grain at home and have also been allocated 7 mu of land from the traitor. All this is thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership in liberating us." Young people Yan Youcai, Yang Maolin, Yao Ziyang, and others wrote collectively: "In the past, our lives were worse than livestock. Every day, we either worked for the landlords or mined coal in the Xiayuan mines, eating chaff and vegetables, never getting enough to eat all year round. Now, we are living a happy and free life, and we are also studying politics and culture in people's schools. We young people will always follow you to the new world." (Note: Jimingyi is a village west of Huailai City on the Ping-Sui Railway. Since its liberation last August, after a year of vigorous liquidation, rent reduction, and the great production movement, all 330 landless poor peasants and tenant farmers in the village have obtained land to cultivate. Among them, 18 poor peasant households and 1 tenant farmer household have risen to become middle peasants, and the original few middle peasant households have also risen to become wealthy middle peasants. Loafers and prostitutes have disappeared from the village.)

　　旅烟外侨外商七十余人
    撰文祝贺我党诞辰
    怀来鸡鸣驿翻身群众写信给毛主席致谢！
    【新华社烟台三日电】旅烟希、法、苏、捷、犹太等各国侨民、商民糜振铎、吉思德、巴狄斯、巴顿克、塞根尔等七十余人，撰文祝贺中国共产党诞生二十五周年，内称：“使得外侨特别欢快的是英勇的八路军把烟台从日寇残暴野蛮的羁绊下解放出来，民主政府将对于所有外侨与天主教堂慈善事业，给予照顾与扶助。八路军官兵纪律严明，对于各阶层人士之一律妥善保护，尤其值得我们衷心感激。”
    【新华社宣化三日电】大翻身后的怀来鸡鸣驿村（平绥路旁）群众，在“七一”前夕，全村集会庆祝中共二十五岁的生日，并写了一二十封致毛主席和共产党中央委员会申谢的信。几辈子都是佃农的朱祥信内写道：“我是一个穷人，爹娘没有给我留下产业，血汗都给那些恶棍大财主压干了，共产党却帮助我们苦人置下了土地，还告诉我们生产过光景的方法，我全家人都喜欢得没得说了”。老农人信里报告他光景上升的情形说：“从前我租种地主十四亩半土地，打了十五石粮食，就要交八石四斗租子，还要给鬼子出官粮、拿花销，向人家借粮，叫人家大叔也不理，现在家里有了粮食，又分得了汉奸的七亩土地，这都是毛主席领导我们翻身的功劳”。青年阎有才、杨茂林、姚子扬等集体写的信中说：“过去我们的生活不如牲口，每天不是替财主应差，就是在下花园矿上挖煤，吃糠咽菜，终年不得一饱，现在我们已过着美满自由的生活了，而且在民校学习政治文化，我们青年要永远跟你走到新世界去。”（按：鸡鸣驿为怀来城西平绥路西的一个农村，自去年八月解放后，经过这一年来轰轰烈烈的清算减租和大生产运动，村中三百三十户没地的贫雇农，都已获得土地耕种，其中十八户贫农和一户佃农，且已上升为中农，原来几户中农，也都上升为富裕中农，村中二流子、暗娼等已绝迹。）
