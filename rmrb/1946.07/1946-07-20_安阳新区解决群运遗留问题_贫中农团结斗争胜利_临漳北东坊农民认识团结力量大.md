　　[News from our newspaper] In the areas of Shuiyu and Jishan in the newly liberated area of Anyang, the leftover problems from the mass movement have recently been resolved. The broad masses of middle peasants have joined the peasant association, and the mood of the masses has suddenly become active, leading to new developments in the mass movement. In the past six months or so, the mass movement in the area infringed upon the interests of middle peasants in matters such as fighting against traitors and bullies, combating corruption, clearing debts and redeeming land, allocating the purchase of guns and ammunition, and finding employers for unemployed workers, causing panic and suspicion among middle peasants. Among the poor peasants, there were erroneous ideas such as "fearing the wavering of middle peasants" and "fearing that middle peasants would share the fruits," and they were unwilling to absorb middle peasants into the peasant association. Counter-revolutionaries took the opportunity to sow discord, further creating disunity between middle and poor peasants. The fruits of the struggle in Jishan Village were, due to the small strength of the peasant association, shamelessly denied and delayed by landlords and bullies, who refused to give them up. Some of what was given up was distributed over too small an area, creating excuses for counter-revolutionaries to sow discord. Village cadres and activists felt isolated, and thoughts of a change in regime grew; some even compromised and degenerated in collaboration with counter-revolutionaries; even some village political institutions were controlled by counter-revolutionaries, and the masses suffered losses in matters such as burdens and corvée labor. Upon discovering these problems, the leadership immediately enlightened the peasant association on "how to expand strength," and everyone felt that it was necessary to unite the majority; they also conducted research on "the relationship between middle peasants and landlords and bullies, clarifying that middle peasants were also subject to exploitation and oppression, that the fate of poor and middle peasants was the same, and that they should unite with each other." After ideological understanding was achieved, the following five important issues were specifically resolved: (1) Land seized from middle peasants by rich peasants was returned; land seized from middle peasants by middle or poor peasants was appropriately adjusted, and a portion was compensated from confiscated traitor land and public land. (2) The money spent by middle peasants on purchasing weapons in the past was compensated in part or in full with the fruits of the struggle. (3) Hired laborers assigned to middle peasant families who had turned over a new leaf were persuaded to return home; those who had not turned over a new leaf were provided with alternative arrangements, and some went to replace hired laborers who had already turned over a new leaf in the homes of landlords and rich peasants. (4) Issues such as rent and wages between middle peasants and ordinary peasants were all resolved through arbitration. (5) The scope of distribution of the fruits of struggle was expanded: generally, about 80% of peasant households in each village received a share (with poorer households receiving more). After these issues were resolved, the mood and public opinion of the middle peasants changed. A middle peasant in Fucheng Village said: "The government really treats us as its own people! Whatever it says it will do, it does!" "The peasant association is really our own association; everyone who farms has a share!" The peasant associations in each village immediately underwent a rapid expansion. The Jishan Village Peasant Association increased sharply from 80 households to 192 households, accounting for 70% of the total number of households. In Shuiyu Village, 110 out of 135 households joined the peasant association. They said: "The remaining twenty-odd households can't cause any more trouble!" "Whether the world changes or not is up to us; if we don't let it change, it won't!" The middle and poor peasants of Jishan Village united as one and launched a struggle against the "Eight Great Stewards," the ruling clique in the village, and achieved victory. The 1.2 million in debt owed by landlords and bullies to the peasants was distributed to each household on the first day, and the members of the small groups immediately launched a struggle to demand repayment, which was immediately collected. In Shuiyu Village, a struggle against the big running dogs (with "face-washing" for the small running dogs) and a struggle against unfair burdens were also launched, and both achieved victory. Other villages, such as Fucheng, are also, under the united efforts of middle and poor peasants, beginning to brew new struggles, demanding to thoroughly shatter the feudal reactionary forces and achieve the complete emancipation of the peasants.

　　安阳新区解决群运遗留问题
    贫中农团结斗争胜利
    临漳北东坊农民认识团结力量大
    【本报讯】安阳新解放区水峪、积善一带最近解决了群运中遗留问题，广大中农涌入农会，群众情绪顿现活跃，群运有新的发展。该地近半年多群运中，曾在反奸霸、反贪污、清债赎地、派购枪支子弹、为失业雇工找雇主等问题上侵犯了中农利益，使中农发生恐惶、疑虑。贫农中则有“怕中农动摇”、“怕中农分果实”等错误思想，不愿吸收中农参加农会。反动分子借机挑拨，更形成中、贫农不团结。积善村的斗争果实，由于农会力量小，地主恶霸就无耻抵赖、拖延，不肯吐出来。有些吐出来的，由于分配面太小，也造成反动分子挑拨的借口。村干部积极分子自感孤立，变天思想滋长，个别的与反动分子妥协，蜕化了；甚至部分村政机构被反动分子掌握，在负担、支差等问题上群众都吃了些亏。领导上发现了这些问题，即从“如何扩大力量”上启发农会讨论，一致感到非团结多数不可；又从“中农与地主恶霸的关系上展开研究，弄清中农也受剥削压迫，贫农和中农命运相同，应互相团结。”思想打通以后，随即具体解决了以下五个重要问题：（一）富农抽了中农的地，予以退回；中农或贫农抽中农的地，作了适当调剂，并由没收汉奸地与公地中补偿一部。（二）以前让中农购买武器花了的钱，用斗争果实补偿了一部或全部。（三）分配到中农家里的雇工，已翻身的，劝其回家；未翻身的，另外作了安置，有的去替换地主富农家里已翻身的雇工。（四）中农与一般农民间租息工资等问题。一律仲裁解决。（五）扩大斗争果实的分配面：一般村都分到了百分之八十左右的农户中（贫苦的分配较多）。经过这样解决，中农的情绪与舆论变了。阜城村中农说：“政府真是把咱当自己人看哩！说办啥都给办到！”“农会真是咱自己的会，种庄稼的都有份！”各村农会立即得到猛烈扩大。积善村农会由八十户激增至一百九十二户，占总户数百分之七十。水峪村一百三十五户，有一百一十户涌进农会。他们说：“剩下那二十多户，再想坏也坏不开啦！”“天变不变由咱；不叫他变就变不了！”积善村中农贫农团结一致，展开对该村统治集团“八大总管”的斗争，并取得胜利。地主恶霸拖欠农民一百二十万款子，第一天分给各户，第二天会员小组便分头展开讨索斗争，马上讨齐了。水峪村开展了反大走狗斗争（小走狗进行“洗脸”）与反负担不公斗争，也都获得胜利。其他如阜城等数村，也在中、贫农团结一致下，开始酝酿新的斗争，要求彻底击碎封建反动势力，取得农民彻底翻身。（孙子英、何高民）
