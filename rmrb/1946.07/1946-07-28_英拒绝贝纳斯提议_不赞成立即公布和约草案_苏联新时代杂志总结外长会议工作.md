Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 25th: United Press, London: A British Foreign Office spokesman stated that the British government has replied to Washington, rejecting Benes' proposal to immediately publish the original text of the five-nation draft peace treaties. The British government only agrees to publish these treaties before the conference next week. It is also learned that the British government will not immediately make a decision on the U.S. proposal for full economic cooperation between the U.S. occupation zone and other regions. According to reports from London, some within the British government and the British Control Commission in Germany favor merging the Western zones into an economic unit, regardless of the Soviet Union's attitude. However, others advocate for a more cautious approach. They believe that before taking any action that could divide Germany into two economic and political regions, the British government will seek the cooperation of the Soviet Union through other means.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 25th: Moscow Radio broadcast the editorial of the 14th issue of the Soviet New Era magazine, summarizing the work of the second Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. The article pointed out: "The Paris negotiations showed the actual possibility of resolving post-war issues among the major powers. This proves that the main condition for success lies in cooperation among the major powers, which is only possible when a certain major power or a group of major powers abandons the idea of forcing others to accept their own will."

    【新华社延安二十五日电】合众社伦敦讯：英外交部发言人称：英政府已答复华盛顿，拒绝贝纳斯立即公布五国和约草案原文的提议，英国政府仅赞成在下周和会举行以前公布这些和约。又悉：英政府对于美国提出之美国占领区与其他区域充分经济合作之建议，将不致立即采取决定。据伦敦所传之消息，英政府及德境英管制委员会中，有若干赞成不顾苏联之态度如何，决将西方诸区合并为经济单位者，但有主张更慎重其事者。他们相信在采取足以影响德国分为经济及政治上两个区域之任何行动前，英政府将另行设法以获得苏联之合作。
    【新华社延安二十五日电】莫斯科广播苏联新时代杂志第十四期的社论，总结第二次巴黎外长会议的工作，该文指出：“在巴黎谈判中，表明各大列强间解决战后问题的实际可能性，这证明成功的主要条件，在于各大列强之间的合作，这只有在某一列强或某几个列强集团放弃其强迫别人接受自己意志的思想时，始有可能。”
