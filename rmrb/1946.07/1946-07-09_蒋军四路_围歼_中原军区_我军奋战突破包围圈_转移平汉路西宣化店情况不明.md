　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: News: The Kuomintang army, acting on Chiang Kai-shek's orders to "annihilate" the Central Plains Military Region of the Communist Party of China starting on June 26th, disregarded the Executive Headquarters' injunctions and launched a general attack on Xuanhuadian, the central location of the Central Plains Military Region, on June 30th. From that date to the present, the situation in Xuanhuadian is unknown. However, it is understood that a portion of the Central Plains Military Region's troops have been forced to break through the encirclement and move to the west of the Pinghan Railway. On the afternoon of June 30th, Peng Peizeng, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang, issued a statement on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek that "no military action will be taken against the Communist army to await the resolution of various unresolved issues," yet on the same day, the Kuomintang army attacked Xuanhuadian, proving the complete deceptiveness of Kuomintang propaganda. Xuanhuadian originally housed the Thirty-Second Executive Group, dedicated to guaranteeing the May 10th Central Plains ceasefire agreement, but the Kuomintang representatives of the group refused to mediate and abandoned their posts, bringing the group's work to a complete standstill, demonstrating that the Kuomintang army had been plotting "encirclement and annihilation" for a long time, and that the May 10th agreement was purely perfunctory. At the time, the Kuomintang side repeatedly propagated that they had no intention of encirclement and annihilation, and accused our side of fabricating such claims. But the truth is now clear to the world. The Kuomintang army attacking Xuanhuadian was divided into four routes: one route, the 122nd Division of the 41st Army, moving from the Xinyang area, occupied Zhou Dangfan, Chaogangdian, Zhutangdian and other places north of Xuanhuadian; another route, the 125th Division and 127th Division of the 47th Army, moving from Guangshan and Luoshan, occupied Popi River southwest of Guangshan; a third route, the 174th Division of the 48th Army, moving from Shangcheng; and a fourth route, the New 13th Division and New 15th Division of the 72nd Army, moving from Huang'an, totaling approximately 80,000 troops. Our army was forced to defend itself and fought valiantly, breaking through to the west. Currently, the Kuomintang army is continuing to fiercely "mop up" in the areas surrounding Xuanhuadian. Other Kuomintang troops are still concentrating in Shangcheng, Huang'an and other places from Fuyang and Huangpi to strengthen the "mopping up" of our liberated areas east of the Pinghan Railway. At the same time, in order to carry out Chiang Kai-shek's order of "encircling and annihilating in one fell swoop," the Kuomintang army is not allowing our army to break out for survival and has strengthened the blockade of the Xinyang, Liulin, Wushengguan, and Guangshui line. In addition to the main force of the original defending 66th Army, it has also transferred a division of the 41st Army, the main force of the 15th Army, and three divisions of the 76th Army to this line to intercept. As for the west of the Pinghan Railway, the Kuomintang has also mobilized large forces and local units to attack the Xishuanghe, Guxian, Tongbai, and Biyang line west of Xinyang, launching fierce attacks on our troops on the west side of the Pinghan Railway.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 2nd: News: In order to realize its long-planned vicious strategy of "encircling and annihilating" the CCP's Central Plains troops, the Kuomintang army, after the Wuhan Agreement, abandoned its promises and systematically nibbled away at and attacked the Central Plains liberated areas, gradually compressing the encirclement and strengthening the blockade of the areas surrounding the Central Plains. According to incomplete statistics, from May 10th to June 25th, a total of 45 days, it launched more than 120 attacks against us, using forces of over 100,000. The focus of the attacks, west of the Pinghan Railway, was the Hebei Liberated Area, including Xinyang, Queshan, Biyang, and Tongbai, and the Jianghan Liberated Area, north to Sui, Zao (Yang), east bordering the Pinghan Railway, and bounded by the Han River on the southwest sides; east of the Pinghan Railway, it was the Eastern Hubei Liberated Area centered on Xuanhuadian. Under the superior military strength and fierce artillery fire of the Kuomintang army, over forty important strongholds of our Central Plains Military Region were occupied. Before June 25th, our Central Plains troops had already been forced into an extremely narrow area, and the Kuomintang army brazenly implemented Chiang Kai-shek's "encirclement and annihilation" plan starting on the 26th, attempting to "encircle and annihilate" our army in one fell swoop.

　　蒋军四路“围歼”中原军区
    我军奋战突破包围圈
    转移平汉路西宣化店情况不明
    【新华社延安五日电】军息：奉蒋介石命令于六月二十六日开始“歼灭”中共中原军区部队的国民党军，不顾执行部的制止，于六月三十日总攻中原军区中心所在地宣化店。自是日起迄今，宣化店情况不明。但悉中原军区部队一部，已被迫突破包围圈，转移至平汉路西。按六月三十日下午，国民党中宣部部长彭沛曾代蒋介石声明“不对共军采取军事行动，以静候各项未决问题之解决”，而同日国民党军即进攻宣化店，证明国民党宣传的完全欺骗性。宣化店原驻有第三十二执行小组，专为保障五月十日中原停战协议者，但该组国民党代表拒绝调处，自动离开职守，致该组工作完全停顿，可见国民党军蓄谋“围歼”为时已久，而五月十日之协议完全出于敷衍。当时国民党方面曾再三宣传，彼方决无围歼意图，并诬我方之揭露为捏造。但事实真相现已大白于世。进攻宣化店之国民党军，共分四路：一路为自信阳方面出动、占领了宣化店以北之周党畈、潮港店、朱堂店等地的第四十一军一二二师；一路为自光山并罗山方面出动、占领了光山西南泼皮河的第四十七军一二五师一二七师；一路为自商城方面出动之第四十八军一七四师；一路为自黄安方面出动之第七十二军新十三师新十五师，共约八万余人。我军被迫自卫力战，向西突围，现在国民党军正在宣化店周围地区继续猛烈清剿中。其他国民党军仍由阜阳、黄陂向商城、黄安等地集中，以加强对我平汉路东解放区的清剿。同时，国民党军为执行蒋介石“一举包围歼灭”的命令，不许我军突围求生，已加强封锁信阳、柳林、武胜关、广水一线。除原守军六十六军主力外，又调四十一军一个师、十五军主力、七十六军三个师至该线堵击。至于平汉路以西，国民党亦已调动大军及地方团队进攻信阳以西之西双河、固县、桐柏、泌阳之线。向我平汉路西侧部队猛烈进攻中。
    【新华社延安七月二日电】军息：国民党军为实现其蓄谋已久的“围歼”中共中原部队的毒策，在武汉协议以后，即放弃诺言，有计划的向中原解放区猛烈蚕食及进攻，逐步压缩包围圈，并加强对于中原周围地区的封锁。据不完全统计，自五月十日起至六月二十五日止四十五天中，曾向我进攻一百二十余次，动用兵力在十万人以上。进攻的重点，在平汉路西者，为我信阳、确山、泌阳、桐柏等地的河北解放区，及北起随、枣（阳）、东临平汉路、西南两面界汉水之间的江汉解放区；在平汉路东者，则为以宣化店为重心的鄂东解放区。在国民党军的优势兵力与猛烈炮火进攻下，我中原军区被占去的重要据点，计四十余处。至六月二十五日以前，我中原部队已被迫处于极狭小的地带，国民党军乃于二十六日起，悍然实行蒋介石的“围歼”计划，企图“一举包围歼灭”我军。
