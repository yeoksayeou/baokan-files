　　Kleimen Visits General Chen Yi
    Commander Chen earnestly stated: The resolution of the Shandong issue depends on the actions of the reactionary troops throughout the country. The key to war or peace lies mainly with the Kuomintang authorities.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 1st] Major General Kleimen, commander of the Sixth Marine Division of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, flew to Linyi at 10:00 AM on the 29th to visit General Chen Yi, commander of the New Fourth Army and commander of the Shandong Military Region, to exchange opinions on ceasing the current military conflict in Shandong and invited Commander Chen to Qingdao to meet with Wang Yaowu. Commander Chen earnestly stated: "The resolution of the Shandong issue depends on how the reactionary troops act throughout the country. We are currently in a position of being attacked and have no choice but to rise up in self-defense. Facts have proven that the key to deciding war or peace mainly lies with the Kuomintang authorities, not with our side. As long as the Kuomintang authorities implement their promise of a long-term ceasefire, the armed conflict in China and Shandong will immediately cease." Commander Chen expressed his hope that American friends and General Marshall would understand the above situation, prevent Chiang Kai-shek from being obsessed with the ambition of civil war, urge him to quickly achieve peace and democracy, and guarantee the people's political rights. Regarding the trip to Qingdao, Commander Chen stated that the Central Plains, Huainan, Subei and other liberated areas are currently under large-scale attack by the Kuomintang army. Under this tense situation, it is difficult for him to leave his post without authorization. If the war situation can be eased in the future, he will take time to go to Qingdao to meet with all parties and strive to promote peace. Before returning to Qingdao on the same plane at 3:00 PM that day, General Kleimen gladly expressed his willingness to do his best to mediate the military situation in the regions mentioned by Commander Chen.

　　克莱门访陈毅将军
    陈军长恳切表示：山东问题的解决，须视反动派军队在全国范围内行动如何而定，战和关键，主要在国民党当局。
    【新华社临沂一日电】驻青岛美海军陆战队第六师团长克莱门少将，于二十九日上午十时飞抵临沂，访晤新四军军长兼山东军区司令陈毅将军，交换关于停止目前山东军事冲突的意见，并邀陈军长赴青与王耀武氏会谈。陈军长恳切表示：“山东问题的解决，要看反动派军队在全国范围内行动如何而定，我们现处于被攻击地位，不得已才起而自卫。事实证明，决定战与和的关键，主要在国民党当局，而不在我方，只要国民党当局执行长期停战的诺言，中国和山东武装冲突，自会立即停止”。陈军长希望美国朋友和马歇尔将军明了上述情况，阻止蒋介石迷信内战的野心，促其迅速实现和平民主，保证人民政治权利。陈军长对青岛之行，表示目前中原、淮南、苏北等解放区，正受国民党军大规模进攻，在此紧张局势下，本人很难擅离职守，今后战局如能缓和，本人即当抽身赴青，拜会各方，努力促进和平。克莱门将军于当日下午三时乘原机返青，行前欣然表示对陈军长所列举诸地区之军事调停，愿尽最大努力。
