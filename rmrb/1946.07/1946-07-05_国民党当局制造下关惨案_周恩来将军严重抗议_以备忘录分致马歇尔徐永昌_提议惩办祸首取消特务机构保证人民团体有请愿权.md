　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Nanjing Dispatch: Following the great tragedy at Nanjing's Xiaguan Railway Station, where the Kuomintang government condoned secret agents beating Shanghai petitioners and reporters, Zhou Enlai, the Communist representative to the Three-Man Committee, immediately sent a memorandum to the Kuomintang and American representatives, expressing serious protest against the government's indulgence of this atrocity! He also put forward three suggestions for handling the aftermath. The original text is as follows:

　　To General Marshall, General Xu Yongchang, and Minister Yu Dawei: The first paragraph describes the Xiaguan Massacre; it is omitted here.

　　Considering that people's organizations sending representatives to petition the government, regardless of their nature, should be protected by the government. Moreover, the representatives sent by Shanghai people's organizations this time were originally petitioning for peace and the cessation of the civil war, and they also intended to present their opinions to General Marshall, the government, and the CCP representatives in the Three-Man Committee, so as to help the progress of the Three-Man Committee, and should be given due protection.

　　I deeply feel that the Three-Man Committee has always attached importance to the opinions put forward by people's organizations and their representatives, and even people from all walks of life, for the sake of ceasefire and peace. These representatives not only represent the Shanghai people's organizations that elected them, but also represent the more than 100,000 Shanghai citizens who went to Shanghai North Railway Station yesterday to see them off. The government should attach importance to this matter, and not only should it not condone these two hundred-odd secret agent thugs to act recklessly, but it should also meet with them and sincerely listen to the propositions they put forward.

　　Therefore, I hereby lodge a serious protest against the government's condoning of this atrocity in the capital, and propose that the government take the following steps to appease public anger: (1) The government should issue a clear order to punish the culprits who brutally beat the Shanghai peace petitioners at Nanjing Xiaguan Railway Station on June 23; (2) The government should issue a clear order to investigate the responsibility of the local police and military police in this incident and punish them; (3) The government should issue a clear order to abolish the Military Statistics Bureau (Military Intelligence) and the Central Statistics Bureau (Central Intelligence), and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again; (4) The government should issue a clear order to protect the right of people's organizations and individuals to petition and appeal to the government; (5) The government should bear the medical expenses of the injured and full compensation for all losses suffered by each person; (6) The government should be responsible for protecting the safety of the representatives' residence and activities in Nanjing and other places. I would be grateful if the government representatives would provide a response to the above proposals at the next meeting of the Three-Man Committee.

　　Respectfully, Zhou Enlai, Representative of the Chinese Communist Party

　　国民党当局制造下关惨案
    周恩来将军严重抗议
    以备忘录分致马歇尔徐永昌
    提议惩办祸首取消特务机构保证人民团体有请愿权
    【新华社延安二日电】南京讯：南京下关车站发生国民党政府纵容特务痛打上海晋京请愿代表及记者多人的大惨案后，三人会议中共代表周恩来将军，立即以备忘录一份，分致国民党及美国双方代表，对政府放纵此次暴行，表示严重抗议！并提出三项善后意见。原文如下：
    马歇尔将军阁下，徐永昌将军俞大维部长阁下：首段叙述下关惨案经过，此处从略。
    查人民团体推派代表向政府请愿，不论其性质属于何种，都应得到政府保护。何况此次上海人民团体所推派之代表，原为请愿和平，及停止内战而来，且又拟向三人会议中马歇尔将军、政府及中共代表陈述意见，俾有助于三人会议之进行，更宜受到应有之保护。
    我深感三人会议从来都重视人民团体及其代表乃至社会人士为停战和平奔走所提出之意见，而此次代表，不仅代表选举他们的上海人民团体，且能代表昨日亲往上海北站欢送他们的上海十余万市民。政府方面理应重视此事，不仅不应纵使此二百余特务暴徒肆行无忌，且应接见他们，诚意的听取他们提出的主张。
    为此，我特向政府放纵此次首都暴行的事情，提出严重抗议，并提议政府应采取如下步骤，以平公愤：（一）政府应下明令，惩办六月二十三日南京下关车站凶殴上海和平请愿代表的祸首；（二）政府应下明令，追究此次事变中地方警宪之责任，并予惩处；（三）政府应下明令，取消军统、中统等等特务机构，并保证此种同类事件不再发生；（四）政府应明令保护人民团体及个人有向政府请愿及声诉之权利；（五）政府应负担受伤者医药费及各人所受损失之全部赔偿；（六）政府应负责保护各代表在京及其他地方之居住行动的安全。上述提议，务请政府代表于下次三人会议开会时，赐予回答为幸。
                                        中共代表周恩来谨启
