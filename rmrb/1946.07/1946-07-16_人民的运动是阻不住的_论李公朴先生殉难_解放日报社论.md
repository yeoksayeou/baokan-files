　　The People's Movement Cannot Be Stopped
    ——On Mr. Li Gongpu's Martyrdom
    Liberation Daily Editorial
    On the 11th of this month, Mr. Li Gongpu was brutally murdered by fascist secret agents in Kunming and died a heroic death! All people with a sense of justice at home and abroad are expressing boundless indignation at the shameless crime of Chiang Kai-shek's secret service!
    Why did the ruling group headed by Chiang Kai-shek assassinate Mr. Li Gongpu? Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Li Gongpu opposed the policy of non-resistance and called for domestic peace and unified resistance against Japan. Mr. Li and other seven gentlemen were therefore imprisoned by Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Mr. Li once again appealed against Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on foreign powers to wage a civil war, and strongly advocated peace and democracy. Thus, he was even more hated by the dictator, which led to bestial beatings and finally the assassination in Kunming. The murder of Mr. Li Gongpu, as well as the martyrdom of many other patriots (such as Mr. Yang Xingfo and Mr. Shi Liangcai before the War of Resistance, and General Li Zhaolin, Yu Shuzhong, and Li Furen after the end of the War of Resistance), clearly demonstrates that Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule for the past nineteen years has consistently hated all those who fight for independence, peace, and democracy, and does not hesitate to resort to the most cruel and despicable means to deal with them.
    Today, the Chinese fascist dictator frequently uses a set of shameless tactics. On the one hand, he uses force to deal with the people, and on the other hand, he shouts about "peaceful unification" and "political settlement." The murder of Mr. Li Gongpu exposes this tactic. The Chinese fascist dictator, towards Mr. Li Gongpu, a scholar who was unarmed, simply because he spoke for the people and advocated peace and democracy, had to resort to force and was determined to beat him to death and assassinate him. From such a fact, it is not difficult to imagine that Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "peaceful unification" and "political settlement" are just aliases for a military solution, relying on the weapons supplied by foreigners, vainly attempting to "unify" the whole country under the rule of secret agents. Precisely because of this, whether for the people in the liberated areas or for the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, Chiang Kai-shek's most important magic weapon is the four words "military solution." The murder of Mr. Li Gongpu proves that Chiang Kai-shek is further intensifying fascist terror to cooperate with his conspiracy to expand the civil war. Mr. Li's murder is a signal of the reactionaries' more frantic attack on the national peace and democracy movement, which deserves the serious vigilance of the people of the whole country!
    The fascist dictator vainly attempts to intimidate peace and democracy advocates and stop the people from advancing through terror, but history tells us that peace and democracy advocates cannot be intimidated, and the people's advance cannot be stopped! The Chinese people know: "The current rampantness of the Chinese reactionaries does not show their strength and vitality, but shows their weakness and a dying struggle." (July 7th Declaration of the CCP) Didn't Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly order "those who speak of resisting Japan will be executed"? But the sacred War of Resistance Against Japan was still launched, and finally won. Today, the strength of the Chinese people is many times greater than before the war. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to block the torrent of the Chinese people striving for independence, peace, and democracy with dictatorial terror and civil war will inevitably meet with a disastrous defeat, which can be confidently said.
    "We must work for peace and democracy and for the cause of the people to the end, even to death!" This was Mr. Li Gongpu's heroic vow after the Jiaochangkou Incident. Mr. Li Gongpu died a heroic death, but countless fighters across China who are fighting for independence, peace, and democracy will surely follow in Mr. Li's footsteps, break through the dictator's fascist terror, and realize Mr. Li's legacy!

　　人民的运动是阻不住的
    ——论李公朴先生殉难
    解放日报社论
    本月十一日，李公朴先生在昆明惨遭法西斯特务毒手，壮烈牺牲！国内外一切有正义感的人士，对于蒋记特务的无耻罪行，莫不表示无限的愤慨！
    以蒋介石为首的统治集团，为什么要杀害李公朴先生？李公朴先生在抗战前，曾经反对不抵抗主义，呼吁国内和平、一致抗日，李先生等七君子，曾因此而遭蒋介石独裁政府的监禁。抗战胜利以后，李先生又奔走呼吁，反对蒋介石依靠外力进行内战，力主和平民主，于是更遭独裁者的痛恨，于是有较牲口的毒打，以至于昆明的暗杀。李公朴先生的被害，以及其他许多志士的殉难（如抗战前的杨杏佛、史量才等先生，和抗战结束后的李兆麟将军、于树中、李敷仁等先生），都清楚地说明十九年来的蒋介石独裁统治，对于一切为独立和平民主奋斗的人士，是一贯仇视的，是不惜采取最残酷和卑鄙的手段来对付他们的。
    今天中国法西斯独裁者，经常使用一套无耻的手法，他一方面以武力对付人民，另方面却嚷着什么“和平统一”和“政治解决”。李公朴先生的被害，揭穿了这种手法。中国的法西斯独裁者，对于李公朴先生这样一个手无寸铁的一个书生，仅仅因为他替人民说话，主张和平民主，就不能不用武力对付，必欲毒打之暗杀之而后快。从这样一个事实，就不难想见蒋介石所谓“和平统一”和“政治解决”，就是武力解决的别名，就是依仗外人所供给的武装，妄图把全国“统一”在特务统治之下。正因为如此，无论对于解放区人民，或对于国民党统治区的人民，蒋介石最重要的法宝，就是“武力解决”四个大字。李公朴先生的被害，证明了蒋介石正在更进一步地加紧法西斯恐怖，以配合其扩大内战的阴谋。李先生的被害，是反动派对全国和平民主运动更疯狂的进攻的信号，这值得全国人民的严重警惕！
    法西斯独裁者，妄想以恐怖手段来吓倒和平民主人士，来阻住人民的前进，但历史告诉我们，和平民主人士是吓不倒的，人民的前进是阻止不住的！中国人民知道：“目前中国反动派的猖獗，不是表现他们的强大和有生命，而是表示他们的软弱和回光返照。”（中共七七宣言）蒋介石不是曾经三令五申“言抗日者斩”吗？但是神圣的抗日战争还是发动了，并且最后取得胜利了。今天中国人民的力量，比较战前不知强大了好几倍，蒋介石想以独裁恐怖与内战来堵住中国人民争取独立和平民主的洪流，其必然遇到惨败，是可以信言的。
    “一定要为和平民主为老百姓事业干到底，干到死！”这是李公朴先生在较场口事件后的英勇誓言。李公朴先生壮烈牺牲了，但全中国为独立和平民主事业奋斗的无数战士，必将踏着李先生的血迹，冲破独裁者的法西斯恐怖，实现李先生的遗志！
