　　United Press Reporter Comments on Peng Xuepei's Statement
　  Chiang Kai-shek's Position Remains Unchanged
　　Civil War May Erupt at Any Time
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th] According to the Shanghai United Evening News: The United Press correspondent in Nanjing commented that Peng Xuepei's statement indicates that civil war may break out publicly at any time. The United Press reporter said: Since the start of peace negotiations on June 7, Chiang Kai-shek has consistently adhered to his position, rejecting the final concessions of the Chinese Communist Party, preferring to delay the situation and disregarding the dangerous consequences. Peng Xuepei announced Chiang Kai-shek's statement yesterday (the 8th), interpreting the statement as an indefinite extension of the truce. However, observers here point out that there are two possible futures: (1) An open and large-scale war will break out immediately in various regions; (2) If the reorganization of the army cannot be resolved according to the government's wishes, all agreements already made will become empty promises. Peng said: "If the Chinese Communists continue to attack government troops, the government will be forced to resist and implement counter-attacks." Observers believe that this is the most accurate explanation of the government's current military policy, meaning that in some areas, the government believes that under the "attack" of the Communist army, the civil war is about to break out publicly. Peace negotiations are tenuously continuing, but few believe in a good outcome, as the government insists on demanding that the Communist army withdraw from northern Jiangsu, Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and the Northeast's Harbin, Qiqihar, and all important railway lines.

　　合众社记者评彭学沛声明
　  蒋介石立场无改变
　　内战可能随时爆发
    【新华社延安十二日电】据沪联合晚报载：合众社驻南京记者评论彭学沛之声明，为表示内战随时可能公开爆发。合众社记者说：自六月七日开始和平谈判以来，蒋介石始终坚持立场，拒绝中共最后之让步，宁令局势拖延，置危险之后果于不顾。彭学沛昨日（八日）公布蒋介石文告，将该项文告，解释为休战之无期延长。但此间观察家指出：可能之前途有二：（一）各地立刻爆发公开而大规模之战争；（二）整军问题，如不克按照政府之愿望予以解决，一切已订之协定，均将化为泡影。彭氏有云：“中共如继续攻击政府军队，政府将被迫抵抗，并施行反攻”。观察家认为此乃目前政府军事政策之最确切说明，其意乃谓若干区域，政府均认为在共军“攻击”之下，内战即将公开爆发。和平谈判藕断丝连，但众信很少良好结果，因政府坚持要求共军撤出苏北、张家口、承德和东北之哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔及一切重要铁道线。
