The Kuomintang Reactionaries Treacherously and Secretly Block the River
    Hebei and Shandong Face Overwhelming Disaster
    Leading Official of the Administrative Office states: Hoping that the Kuomintang authorities will pull back from the brink. Hoping that righteous people across the country will rise up to stop this inhumane crime. Calling on all people in the region to rise up in self-defense.
    [Our newspaper's urgent telegram from Heze, 4th] The leading official of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office recently issued a statement regarding the Kuomintang's violation of the Nanjing Agreement and the secret blocking of the river: According to a telegram from Comrade Zhao Mingfu, our representative stationed at the Yellow River Commission in Kaifeng, on the 22nd, "The Huayuankou blocking project has been throwing stones day and night since the 23rd. A large number of workers are being recruited from Xuzhou, Weihui and other places, actively preparing to excavate the diversion channel, dismantle the Xinbian Railway and highway, and carry out the closure and water release." This move is clearly a betrayal of trust and a violation of the Nanjing Agreement. Since the Nanjing Agreement, our side has faithfully implemented it and started work ahead of schedule. We have now mobilized 237,000 workers, bringing their own food, tools, and enduring sun and dew, actively restoring the dikes under extremely difficult conditions. However, the Kuomintang has been slow to fulfill its responsibilities, and has instead obstructed and sabotaged in various ways. The facts are as follows: (1) Apart from a portion of flour and a small amount of equipment and medicine transported by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), work funds, materials, and urgently needed equipment have not been allocated to this day. (2) The relocation and relief funds for residents in the river area have not been distributed at all. (3) In the old course above Changyuan in the Kuomintang area, only the south bank is being repaired, not the north bank. The dike restoration project on a section of the old course near Jinan in the Kuomintang area has not yet started. (4) In the Kaocheng and Changyuan area, Kuomintang troops and puppet troops frequently harass, detain our dike repair cadres and masses. He Siyuan in Jinan expelled Comrade Liu Jiqing, our representative from the Bohai area, detained our river management equipment and vehicles, and dispatched special agents to direct puppet troops to wantonly kill our dike repair personnel in Changqing and other places. (5) The Nanjing Agreement stipulates that the issue of stone throwing should be decided through consultation on June 15th, depending on the progress of the downstream dike restoration project, with the principle of not causing floods downstream. Later, because the Kuomintang failed to allocate funds as scheduled, it was agreed in Kaifeng to go to Nanjing on July 1st to discuss whether to throw stones and dismantle roads. However, most of the dike restoration project has not been completed, and the residents in the river area have not been relocated, yet the Kuomintang has secretly thrown stones and is preparing to excavate the diversion channel, dismantle the Xinbian Railway and highway, and carry out the closure and water release. If this treacherous act is allowed to continue, it will inevitably lead to floods, causing tens of millions of people in Hebei and Shandong provinces to face an overwhelming disaster. This shows that the real purpose of the Kuomintang authorities in throwing stones to block the river is not to manage the river but to attempt to flood our liberated areas in order to cooperate with its large-scale civil war that is being actively prepared. In addition to lodging a serious protest with the Kuomintang and urgently calling on all people in our region to rise up in self-defense, we especially appeal to righteous people across the country to jointly stop the inhumane crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in order to save the lives and property of tens of millions of people in Hebei and Shandong provinces. We also hope that the Kuomintang and the Yellow River Commission authorities will pull back from the brink and immediately stop throwing stones, otherwise the Kuomintang reactionaries should be fully responsible for any serious consequences.

　　国民党反动派背信弃义私自堵口
    冀鲁面临覆没大灾
    行署负责人谈称：望国民党当局悬崖勒马。望全国正义人士急起制止这一绝灭人性之罪行。号召全区人民奋起自卫。
    【本报荷泽四日急电】冀鲁豫行署负责人顷对国民党破坏南京协议，私自堵口事发表谈话称：据我驻开封黄委会代表赵明甫同志二十二日来电称：“花园口堵口工程已于廿三日起日夜抛石，并从徐州、卫辉等地招雇大批工人，积极准备挖掘引河，拆除新汴铁道及公路，进行合龙放水。”这种举措，显系背信弃义破坏南京协议。查南京协议以来，我方即忠实执行，提前开工。现已动员二十三万七千工人，自带工粮、工具，日晒夜露，在极困难之条件下积极复堤，而国方对其所负之责任，迟不履行，反而多方阻扰破坏，其事实如下：（一）除联总运来一部分面粉及少数器材药品外，工款工料及急用器材至今尚未拨付。（二）河漕居民之迁移救济费分文未发。（三）国民党区长垣以上故道只修南岸，不修北岸，济南附近国民党区一段故道之复堤工程仍未动工。（四）考城、长垣一带，国民党军及伪军时出袭扰，拘捕我修堤干部及群众，济南何思源则驱逐我渤海区代表刘季青同志，扣留我治河器材及车辆，并派遣特务，指使伪军，大肆残杀我长清等地修堤人员。（五）抛石问题南京协议规定六月十五日视下游复堤工程情形如何，会商决定，以不使下游发生水患为原则，后因国方未能如期拨款，乃又在开封商定，改于七月一日赴南京商讨是否抛石拆路，而今复堤工程大半未竣，河漕居民亦未迁移，而国民党竟私自抛石，并准备挖掘引河，拆除新汴铁道及公路，进行合龙放水，这种背信弃义之行为，倘任其继续，必致洪水泛滥，使冀鲁两省数千万人民面临覆没大祸。这说明了国民党当局抛石堵口的真正目的，不在治河而在企图淹我解放区，以配合其正在积极准备之大规模内战，我们除向国方提出严重抗议，并紧急号召我全区人民奋起自卫外，特向全国正义人士，迫切呼吁，共起制止国民党反动派绝灭人性之罪行，以挽救我冀鲁两省数千万人民之生命财产，更望国民党及黄委会当局悬崖勒马立即停止抛石，否则引起任何严重恶果，应完全由国民党反动派负责。
