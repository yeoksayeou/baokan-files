　　A Remote Salutation to Mr. Ma Yichu (Xulun)
    Yang Xiufeng
    My old comrade-in-arms in the struggle for national democracy for many years, this time he was again brutally attacked at the Xiaguan Railway Station in Nanjing, along with Mr. Yan, Lei, and Chen, for appealing for peace and opposing the civil war, and was injured and hospitalized in the Central Hospital! A moment of sorrow, infinite respect, I piously pray for Mr. Ma's early recovery in the distant ancient capital of Zhao!
    The shameless tricks of the reactionary partisans can be said to be getting worse and worse. In broad daylight, secret agents beat people, and they even blamed the refugees. Compared with the rogue tone of the generals who shouted "You have the freedom to hold meetings inside the school walls, and I have the freedom to shoot outside the school walls" not long ago, it is even more despicable. Even compared to the stage-managed attacks on the presidium by fake meeting attendees at the Jiaochangkou incident, the destruction of newspaper offices by disguised students in Chengdu, the staged fights under the guise of competing for venues in Zhongshan Park, and even the "special students" beating professors who gave lectures at Yenching University, it is even more vile. The Chinese fascist partisans created an unprecedented great famine in nineteen provinces, creating tens of millions of refugees, and the Goebbels of the time were so cruel that they could say such "frame-up" words, which cannot but be surprising. This shows how vicious the fascists are, and also shows their "exhaustion of tricks" and weakness in the face of the national people's masses. Mr. Yichu, who is in bed with injuries! You will give a hearty smile, won't you?
    Mr. Yichu! You are not alone.
    Accompanied by the cries of refugees in nineteen provinces, there is a loud tone of "When will this sun perish? I will die with you!" that permeates the earth!
    With each shameless act of the fascist secret agents, there is the "cold mockery" and iron fist retaliation of thousands upon thousands of people!
    The era of Yuan Shikai, Cao Kun, and Duan Qirui has long passed, and the Hitler and Mussolini elements are also weeping before the people's court; the "Chinese-style fascists" who combine Chinese and foreign despotism into one furnace, even if they have the rescue of powerful imperialist elements, they are too shameful for their foreign ancestors to "call themselves subjects" and "call themselves sons" to foreigners; and internally, they are pitiful to use refugees as a "screen wall," which is too unpromising for their foreign masters. Showing their poverty to the fullest, they are just a wisp of fascist ghost in the torrent of people's democracy.
    The power of the Chinese people's masses is growing and developing so fast, and the cry for peace and democracy resounds across the land, growing flourishing flowers of democracy and freedom on the land of 130 million people, which no beast can trample. Mr. Yichu! Today is very different from the time when we fought hand in hand in Beiping during the "December 9th Movement." The sympathy of hundreds of millions of people for the old fighters of the national democratic struggle is not tears, not futile appeals and indignation, but a great force that can truly curb the adverse current and teach the thugs to bow their heads and confess their sins! Thinking of this, will Mr. Ma's injury heal sooner because of heartfelt comfort?
    Countless people care, countless people pray, and countless people are holding high the great banner of national independence and freedom, and national peace and democracy, fighting bitterly against those extremely shameless fake refugees and imperialist elements.
    Mr. Yichu, you are not alone, rest assured and recuperate!
    From the north to the south, I briefly express my sincere feelings to comfort my old friend. Words cannot fully express my meaning, I only hope that you will understand. And please convey my regards to Mr. Yan, Lei, and Chen.
                                            June 29th

　　遥慰马夷初（叙伦）先生
    杨秀峰
    多年来为民族民主斗争的老战友，这回又为反对内战呼吁和平在南京下关车站与阎、雷、陈诸先生同遭毒手，负伤就医于中央医院了！刹那的怆怀，无限的敬慰，谨在遥远的赵国故都，虔祷先生早日康复！
    反动党徒之无耻伎俩可谓每况愈下。光天化日，特务打人，而竟嫁祸于难民，比之不久以前将军们高叫“你们在校墙内有开会自由，我在校墙外有打枪自由”的无赖腔调固然愈显其卑鄙，即比之较场口之假装与会群众登台凶殴主席团，比之成都之伪装学生，捣毁报馆，比之中山公园假托争夺会场，大打出手，甚至比“特殊学生”打燕大座谈讲演之教授，也是更为下流。中国法西斯党徒制造了十九省空前的大灾荒，制造了几千万的难民，而戈贝尔之流竟忍心害理到这种地步，说得出这样“栽赃”的话来，不能不令人感到意外。这显示出法西斯分子是何等狠毒，也显示出他们之“黔驴技穷”，与在全国人民大众前战斗的软弱。伤榻中的夷初先生！你会发出沁心的微笑罢？
    夷初先生！你不是孤单的。
    伴着十九省难民的哭声，有弥漫大地的“时日曷丧予及汝偕亡”的高亢音调！
    随着法西斯特务之每一次无耻行为而来的，是千千万万人“冷嘲”与铁拳的回报！
    袁世凯、曹钜、段祺瑞之时代早经过去，希特勒、墨索里尼分子也正在人民法庭前哭泣；冶中外专制于一炉的“中式法西斯”纵有富强的帝国主义分子营救，然而他们对外腼然“称臣”“称儿”，既太为其外国祖师丢脸；而对内可怜到以难民为“影壁”，亦太不为其外国主子争气。穷相毕露，人民民主狂澜中一缕法西斯游魂而已。
    中国人民大众力量生长发育的这样快，和平民主的喊声响彻大地，在一亿三千万人的国土上滋长起繁茂的民主自由之花，任何野兽践踏不掉。夷初先生！今天与“一二九”当年，我们在北平携手奋斗的时代大不相同了。亿万人对民族民主斗争的老战士的同情，不是流泪，不是徒然的呼吁与愤慨，而是具有真正足以遏止逆流，教凶徒们俯首服罪的伟大力量了！想到这一点，先生的伤会因衷心快慰而早愈了罢？
    无数的人在关怀，无数的人在祝祷，无数的人在高擎着民族的独立自由，和国家的和平民主大会向那辈无耻已极的假难民们和帝国主义分子苦斗。
    夷初先生，你不是孤单的，安心的静养罢！
    北地南天，简陈衷曲，以慰故人，言不尽意，诸惟神会。并代致慰问阎、雷、陈诸位先生。
                                            六月二十九日
