Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th. Following the liberation of Shuoxian, the Jin-Sui and Jin-Cha-Ji Eighth Route Armies, at the request of the people, continue to disarm the puppet troops in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway. From the 17th to the 22nd, the Jin-Sui troops successively captured Yangfangkou in the Great Wall section, Shentou Railway Station northeast of Shuoxian, and the strongholds of Shizuizi, Shihuhe, and Duanjiadian, north and south of Ningwu City. From the 21st to the 24th, the Jin-Cha-Ji troops successively liberated the important town of Shanyin County on the Tongpu line. The 200 li of the Tongpu Railway from Yangfangkou to Daiyue is now completely controlled by the Eighth Route Army.

(Special dispatch from Yangcheng, 27th) After the Taiyue Eighth Route Army entered Jiang County on the 20th, the puppet troops entrenched in the city, led by traitor Chen Ziwen, fled with their remnants to the border area between Quwo and Jiang Counties, attempting to continue poisoning the people. At the request of the people, the Eighth Route Army dispatched troops to pursue them, and by the 23rd, had completely wiped out the puppet remnants, killing and wounding more than 450 and capturing more than 600. The puppet leader Chen Ziwen was killed on the spot. This traitor colluded with the Japanese invaders in Jiang County as early as 1943, and the Japanese invaders designated the Fourth District of Jiang County as Chen's area of activity, frequently cooperating with the Japanese invaders to "mop up" the liberated areas and plunder the people's property. More than 3,000 people in Jiang County were killed by him. After the enemy surrendered, Chen continued to entrench himself in Jiang County, constantly harassing the liberated areas, launching as many as 54 attacks since the ceasefire order, using a force of more than 7,640 men. He also dispatched a large number of special agents to the liberated areas to carry out assassinations and sabotage, resulting in the assassination and arrest of more than 230 people. The people of Quwo and Jiang Counties are all applauding and celebrating Chen's death.

　　山西继续解除伪军武装
    我解放山阴杨方口
    控制同蒲北段二百华里
    太岳我军击灭陈逆子文残部
    【新华社延安二十九日电】继解放朔县之后，晋绥、晋察冀八路军应人民之请，继续解除同蒲北段伪军武装。晋绥部队于十七日至二十二日，又连克长城段之杨方口及朔县东北之神头车站与宁武城南北之石咀子、石湖河、段家店等据点。晋察冀部队则于二十一日到二十四日，连续解放同蒲线之重镇山阴县城，自杨方口至岱岳二百华里同蒲线，已完全由八路军控制。
    【本报阳城二十七日专电】太岳八路军二十日进驻绛县后，盘踞该城伪军陈逆子文，即率残部窜往曲（沃）绛（县）边境一带，企图继续荼毒人民。八路军应人民之请，复派队追击，至二十三日将该伪残部全部肃清，计毙伤四百五十余名，六百余名放下武器，伪军头子陈逆子文被当场击毙。按该逆在民国三十二年，即与绛县日寇订立协定，日寇将绛县四区划为陈逆的活动地区，经常配合日寇“扫荡”解放区，打劫人民财物，绛县人民遭其屠杀者，达三千余人。敌人投降后，陈逆仍继续盘踞绛县，不断向解放区袭扰，仅停战令后进攻即达五十四次，使用兵力七千六百四十余人。更派遣大批特务至解放区，进行暗杀破坏，群众遭暗杀及逮捕者，达二百三十余人。此次陈逆殒命，曲（沃）绛（县）人民，莫不拍手称庆。
