　　Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades Association Chongqing Branch
    Advocates Unconditional and Comprehensive Ceasefire
    American Troops Should Immediately Withdraw from China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th] Chongqing News: The Chongqing branch of the Sanmin Zhuyi Comrades Association, organized by democratic figures within the Kuomintang, recently issued "Opinions on the Current Situation," advocating an unconditional and comprehensive ceasefire and the immediate withdrawal of American armed forces from China. The association warned the Kuomintang authorities: "If they insist on acting arbitrarily and continue to expand and prolong the civil war, they will inevitably voluntarily abandon themselves to the people." The association strongly stated: "American troops should immediately withdraw from our country to respect China's independence and freedom." It lodged a Jiaodong protest against the United States' assistance to the Kuomintang in transporting troops and equipment and providing military supplies and loans for the Chinese civil war. It also called on the American people to stand up and stop it. The association called on the people of Sichuan to oppose the authorities' conscription of soldiers and grain for the civil war. It also opposed the Kuomintang authorities' implementation of the police district system and the fascist measures such as concentrated training.
