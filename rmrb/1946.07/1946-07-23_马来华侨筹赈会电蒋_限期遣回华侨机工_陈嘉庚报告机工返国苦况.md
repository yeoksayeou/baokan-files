Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 19th: Singapore News: The Malayan Overseas Chinese Relief Association Aid Overseas Chinese Mechanics Rehabilitation Representative Conference has telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, demanding that all abused Overseas Chinese mechanics and their families be repatriated to the South within two months. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief General Association recruited a large number of mechanics to return to China, rescuing materials on the Yunnan-Burma Road, risking their lives and making great contributions. After the fall of the Yunnan-Burma Highway, the Kuomintang authorities ordered its dissolution, causing the mechanics to become displaced. In Kunming alone, more than 400 people were unable to make a living, some even becoming beggars. Later, after repeated negotiations by Overseas Chinese leaders in Chongqing, requesting relief and assistance to return to the South, they were consistently ignored, which aroused extreme indignation among Overseas Chinese in Malaya. The Nanyang General Association convened a joint meeting of all district relief associations in Kuala Lumpur on the 16th of last month. At the meeting, Mr. Chen Jiageng, after recounting the hardships suffered in dispatching mechanics back to China to serve the country, denounced the Kuomintang authorities for claiming to "receive Overseas Chinese mechanics" and "care for mechanics" as nothing but empty promises. Zhou Xianying, a representative from Singapore, said indignantly: "Today, the government not only disregards the mechanics who have contributed to the country, but also has not shown any concern for the Overseas Chinese who have suffered various disasters after the war. What consideration has it given?" Zhuang Mingli, a representative of the mechanics from the homeland, reported that during the training period after the mechanics returned to China, the only dogma was the four words "absolute obedience." During working hours, the mechanics lacked clothing, and the authorities did not provide it, so many people contracted diseases. In the winter of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the Nanyang General Association donated clothing, shoes, socks, and blankets, but they were all embezzled by the authorities, and the mechanics did not receive them at all. Subsequently, representatives from Penang, Taiping, 巴生 (Klang), 彭亨 (Pahang) and other places gave speeches one after another, expressing indignation at the fact that the Overseas Chinese enthusiastically helped the motherland in the Anti-Japanese War, but the authorities regarded the financial and life sacrifices suffered by the Overseas Chinese as insignificant. The conference finally decided to negotiate sternly with the authorities in the name of the Overseas Chinese Mechanics Rehabilitation Representative Conference.

　　马来华侨筹赈会电蒋
    限期遣回华侨机工
    陈嘉庚报告机工返国苦况
    【新华社延安十九日电】星洲讯：马来亚各区华侨筹赈会援助华侨机工复员代表大会，顷致电蒋介石。限于两个月内将备受虐待的华侨机工及其家属全部遣送南返。抗战期中，南洋华侨筹赈总会招募大批机工回国，在滇缅路上抢救物资，出生入死，树功甚伟。滇缅公路沦陷后，国民党当局即下令解散，致使机工流离失所，昆明一地即有四百余人无法生活，甚至流为乞丐。后经在渝华侨领袖一再交涉，请求救济及协助南返，始终置若罔闻，以致激起全马侨胞的极度愤慨。南侨总会特于上月十六日在吉隆坡召开全马各区筹赈会联席会议，会上陈嘉庚氏于追述派遣机工回国服务所遭苦况后，指斥国民党当局所谓招待华侨机工、关心机工尽是空头支票。星洲代表周献莹氏愤慨的说：“今天政府不仅置为国出力的机工于不顾，对于战后遭受种种灾难的海外侨胞，又何曾有些微顾及？祖国机工代表庄明理报告机工回国后在受训期间，唯一的教条是“绝对服从”四个字。在工作时间，机工们缺乏衣服，当局没有供给，因此很多人感染疾病。二十八年冬，曾由南侨总会寄赠衣履被帐，但均被当局吞蚀，机工们根本没有收到。继由槟城、太平、巴生、彭亨等地代表相继讲演，对华侨热心帮助祖国抗战，而当局对华侨遭受之财产生命牺牲一概等闲视之，表示愤慨。大会最后决定以援助机工复员代表大会名义，向当局严正交涉。
