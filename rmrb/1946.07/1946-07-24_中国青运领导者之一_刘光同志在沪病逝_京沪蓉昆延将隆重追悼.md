Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Shanghai News: Comrade Liu Guang, one of the leaders of the Chinese youth movement, passed away at 7:00 AM on the 18th of this month at the Shanghai Municipal Fourth Hospital due to complications following surgery for a stomach ulcer. After being placed in a coffin at 12:00 PM that day, he was buried in the Shanghai Public Cemetery. Obituaries were issued in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Kunming, and other places, announcing that memorial services will be held regularly.

Comrade Liu Guang was a native of Yiyang, Hunan, from a working-class family. He was 30 years old. During the Great Revolution, he participated in the children's corps in his hometown. After the failure of the Great Revolution, he went to the Shishou County area of Hubei to participate in the local Soviet movement. He joined the Communist Youth League in Shishou in 1930, serving as branch secretary, executive member of the district committee, inspector, and secretary of the Children's Bureau of Shishou County. Later, he went to Shanghai to serve as the secretary of the Children's Bureau of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee. In 1932, he was sent to the Soviet Union to study at the Moscow International Lenin School and the Oriental University. He returned to China in 1937 and served as the Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Youth National Salvation Federation and the president of the China Youth Society. He authored several works, including "On Youth and the Youth Movement." In 1941, he went to Chongqing, where he engaged in youth work in Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, achieving remarkable results and earning the love of the broad masses of youth in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. He went from Yan'an to Shanghai this May, and soon suffered from a stomach ulcer. Despite seeking treatment from famous doctors, he could not be saved. His death is a great loss to the Chinese youth movement. People in Yan'an were deeply saddened upon hearing the news and will hold a memorial service on a scheduled basis.
