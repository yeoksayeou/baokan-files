　　From a Person's Perspective: The Communist Party and the Peasants
    ——The Ideological Transformation of Geng Lanyu, Director of the Agricultural Association of Shengfotang Village
    Pan Jiang

    Geng Lanyu possesses the hands of a laborer, having spent years toiling with the land. The young men all call him "Ox," vividly portraying the hardships of his life.

    Before the famine, Lanyu was not highly regarded. The whip of life relentlessly drove him, causing him to live a life of sharecropping and odd jobs. The landlords' endless exploitation nearly silenced Lanyu. In his own words, "East of the main road, that's where the rich people live. We poor folks don't want to go over there, lest we be suspected of something. We rarely go to the village meetings, and if we absolutely have to, we huddle by the wall, not saying a word unless asked. The rich are always in charge. We're clumsy and don't speak well, and if we say something wrong, even if we don't get scolded, we'll still get a nasty look."

    The Lugouqiao Incident didn't shake him much. He thought, "The Japanese devils are bad, not letting the common people live in peace. But the officials (referring to the Nationalist government before the incident) weren't good to the common people either. I'm just a poor wretch. If the Japanese devils come, I'll just run. They might not even burn down my two broken houses. There's no overnight rice in my jar, so there's nothing to steal. They're both the same; it doesn't matter who comes. I'm just a poor sharecropper anyway." Later, a worker named Liu came to his village to organize a self-defense force, teaching them to sing "We Can't Live Without Resisting Japan." But Lanyu didn't believe in this song. He thought, "We poor people are poor anyway. If the Japanese devils come, we'll just run. How can we not live?"

    In 1938, the Eighth Route Army came to the plains. When they passed through his village, people thought, "The 'poor Eighth Route Army' won't last long." They weren't dressed neatly, and their weapons were poor. How could they fight the Japanese? Lanyu naturally thought the same way. But later, the battle of Xiangchenggu burned up several Japanese cars, and people's opinions changed. Lanyu's opinion also changed: "Don't look at their ragged clothes and poor weapons; they're awfully accurate when fighting the Japanese devils." From then on, people talked more about the Eighth Route Army. Some said, "The Eighth Route Army doesn't beat or scold people." Others said, "The Eighth Route Army came, and the bandits disappeared. Their governance is really good." Even so, Lanyu was still skeptical about the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army. After his village became a base area in 1939, workers constantly came to his village to hold meetings, but Lanyu remained the same as before: huddling by the wall, not saying a word. He thought, "The Eighth Route Army only knows how to hold meetings."

    However, there was one thing he strongly supported, which was the implementation of fair burden. Because of the implementation of fair burden, the landlords conspired to divide the land. Lanyu's landlord, Chen Tingzhang, planned to give Lanyu thirty mu of land and an ox. Ostensibly, it was a three-year lease, with the burden in Lanyu's name, but secretly, he would draw up a private contract, dividing the profits in half. Lanyu calculated it and realized it wasn't worth it, so he didn't do it. The landlords cried crocodile tears, saying, "No wonder you're poor, you don't know how to take advantage." Lanyu thought to himself, "The landlords are sweet-mouthed and cruel-hearted, wolves in sheep's clothing. I'm not falling for their tricks." In the end, the sharecroppers won, and the landlords and sharecroppers split the profits evenly, with the landlords paying their own burden.

    The great famine of 1943 naturally fell upon the poor first. To save the masses, the Communist Party and the Anti-Japanese government helped the poor borrow grain from households with surplus grain. Only then did Lanyu realize that the Communist Party cared most about the poor. Soon after, Lanyu's awareness gradually increased, and he joined the Chinese Communist Party.

    The famine became more and more severe, and people were struggling on the brink of death. In the winter, the government lent Lanyu five hundred yuan to buy a small cart, and he joined the transport team to deliver public grain. Before he could even buy the cart, the enemy surrounded the village, and he was captured!

    No matter how the beastly Japanese invaders tortured him in every possible way, demanding that Lanyu confess to being a Communist, Lanyu refused to admit it until death. Hanging, beating, pouring cold water, bayonets to the chest, Lanyu didn't reveal a single Party secret or the location of the public grain storage. He thought, "The Japanese devils are unreasonable anyway. I'll die whether I talk or not. I might as well not talk. One person's death doesn't matter, but I mustn't implicate others." Seeing his stubbornness, the Japanese devils were furious and tortured him to within an inch of his life, but still couldn't get half a word of truth. In the end, they released him.

    Lanyu returned to his village with a body full of wounds. The flames of revenge were ignited, and the song "We Can't Live Without Resisting Japan" that old Liu had taught him echoed in his mind. He regretted not listening to old Liu's words in the first place. He thought, "To avenge this, I must join the Eighth Route Army." He decided to join the army, but his hungry wife and children held him back, and he couldn't fulfill his wish.

    His body didn't join the Eighth Route Army, but his mind did. Lanyu thought, "I will listen to everything the Eighth Route Army says, and I will support everything they do. When they need the common people, I will go. I will let them fight the Japanese devils to their heart's content, to vent my hatred." From then on, Lanyu, who had never been one to meddle, often showed his skills in carrying wounded soldiers and leading the way.

    But then again, Lanyu escaped from the enemy's clutches, but still hadn't escaped the sea of hunger. He sold off the broken-down belongings at home and bought a broken cart, and he transported public grain load after load, saving everyone, and saving himself as well.

    The warm spring breeze blew open the frozen fields. The broad masses were worried, thinking that after a long famine, even if they planted crops, they wouldn't have anything to eat in the near future. At this time, the Communist Party and the government issued a call. The government distributed supporting grain and lent seeds, urging everyone to plant a lot of land. Chairman Mao called on everyone to "organize," to increase production. These two calls deeply touched the hearts of the Shengfotang villagers, who felt that for thousands of years, there had never been such a party and government. Lanyu and Shi Decai, together, transformed from a transport team into a mutual aid group. Lanyu thought, "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are really the savior of the poor! They're so considerate and have such ingenious ideas. I must be a good Party member, listen to whatever the Party says, and do whatever Chairman Mao calls for."

    Time flew by, and 1944 passed quickly. Under the leadership of the democratic government, Lanyu and Shi Decai, relying on their own labor, jumped out of the abyss of hunger. In a year of production, they gained some mutual aid experience and trained a group of strong mutual aid group leaders. Lanyu was one of them.

    Lanyu's mutual aid group was a model group that had won an award for its oxen. Therefore, in 1945, he was elected as the mutual aid team leader. Once, two teams in the village went to Maluo Fort to dig up trees. Lanyu took care of things more thoughtfully, bringing rice to cook, and no one went hungry. Gao Wenhua's team didn't bring rice, so they looked to Lanyu for help. Lanyu said, "I'm not the leader of your team. I don't care." This made the people in Wenhua's team very dissatisfied. Lanyu sincerely criticized himself for this matter this year, saying, "That was because I was narrow-minded and made this mistake." Then he said, "At that time, we didn't know these things. We didn't go to village meetings, and no one said anything. We thought it was enough to do a good job with our own team. This year, after becoming the director of the agricultural association, I constantly go to county and district meetings, and my mind is clear. That was a big mistake. From now on, I have to handle everything that has to do with the agricultural association and the village, as long as they come to me."

    When the Japanese devils surrendered last August, Lanyu was so happy that he didn't know what to say. In order to launch a counteroffensive and disarm the Japanese invaders, after the higher-ups assigned the task of expanding the army, Lanyu went to Dongge Village to find candidates. There was no hope in Ge Village, so he went to Liyuan, but there was still no hope. He thought of the child in his aunt's family in Youfang, who was young and strong and could join the army, so he ran all the way to his aunt's house in Youfang.

    When the village was carrying out rent reduction and interest rate reduction, Geng Yunnian was a high-interest lender. After his death, his estate was inherited by the third son born to his stepmother. The eldest and second sons were well-to-do middle peasants who had made their own way through labor. In the settlement of Geng Yunnian's return of interest, people advocated that the three sons should share the burden. Lanyu believed that since Yunnian's estate was inherited by the stepmother's son, he should bear the burden alone. Although this opinion was not adopted by everyone at the time, the result of the district's inspection was still handled according to Lanyu's opinion.

    More than two years of production mutual aid, and last year's rent reduction and interest rate reduction, greatly improved Lanyu's life. This year, he built three western-style houses. There are only three people in his family, and he already has fifty-four mu of land. He is not a stingy person. He thought, "If it weren't for the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the Eighth Route Army, and the democratic government, how could we have such a life? Where did my land come from? Who turned us over? If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the poor sharecroppers wouldn't even dream of turning over in eight lifetimes!" Indeed, since Lanyu was elected as the director of the agricultural association last winter, he has completed all his work diligently.

    The 25th anniversary of the "July 1st" Party has arrived, and Lanyu is filled with bright and victorious confidence in his party. He said, "Our Communist Party only does good things for the common people, and everyone supports it. The only ones who don't support it are those few man-eating big bullies, landlords, and traitors. As long as the common people agree, and with Chairman Mao's leadership, our Communist Party will definitely succeed."

    When I visited him after wheat harvest, he asked me how the fighting was going with the Kuomintang in the south. I deliberately pressed him and said, "Are we afraid?" He said sternly, "Don't say they (referring to the Kuomintang reactionaries) can't come here. If they come, we'll pull ourselves together and fight them. We're not worried that we can't wipe them out."

　　从一个人看共产党与农民
    ——圣佛堂村农会主任耿兰玉的思想变化
    盘  江
    耿兰玉，长着一副劳动的身手，经年累月的与土地为伴。年青的小伙子们都称他“牛”，逼真地描绘出他生活的艰辛。
    在灾荒以前，兰玉并不为人所重视；生活的鞭子，长年驱策着他过着捎地和打短的日子，地主们无尽止的压榨，使兰玉几乎成了哑巴，如果用兰玉的话说：“大路以东，那是老财住的地方，咱穷人不愿凑那边，犯不着落个嫌疑。村里有啥事，咱是轻易不到，非到不可时，咱就挨墙角蹲下，问不到咱，咱就不哼。啥事都是老财当家，咱拙嘴笨舌的，说的要有一差二错，即便不挨骂，也得看个难看的嘴脸。”
    芦沟桥的炮火对于他并没有多大的震荡：他想：“日本鬼子不好，不叫老百姓过安生日子，而官家（指事变前国民党统治时的政府）对老百姓也没啥好处，咱一个穷光蛋，鬼子来了，拔腿就跑，他也不一定烧那两间破房，缸里没有隔宿米，也不怕抢，两样货色一样行市，不管谁来了，反正咱是一个穷捎地的”。到后来，一个姓刘的工作员到他村去组织自卫队，教唱“不抗日活不成”的歌，可是，兰玉对这个歌是不相信的；他想：咱穷人反正是穷，鬼子来了跑，有啥活不成的”。
    三八年，八路军来到平原，当路过他村时，人们都认为“穷八路”不占弦，穿得既不整齐，家伙又不好，还能打日本？兰玉自然也是这么认识的。后来香城固一仗烧了鬼于好几辆汽车，人们的看法变了，兰玉的看法也变了：“别看穿得破、家伙孬，打起鬼子来怪有准”。从此，人们对八路军的议论便多起来，有的说：“八路军不打人不骂人”。有的说：“八路军一来土匪就没了，治化得真好”……虽然如此，兰玉对共产党八路军仍是半信半疑的。三九年他村成为根据地后，工作人员不断到他村开会，兰玉仍和从前一样：蹲在墙脚，一声不哼。他认为“八路军光会开会”。
    可是，有一桩事他非常赞成，就是实行了公平负担。因为实行公平负担，地主们都阴谋分散土地。兰玉的主家陈廷章。打主意给兰玉三十亩地、一头牛，明里是当三年，负担上在兰玉名下，暗里则私立文契，对半分成。兰玉合量合量不上算，没有干。地主们猫哭老鼠似地说：“怨不得你穷，不识拉补”。兰玉心里想想：“地主们嘴甜心苦、狼心狗肺，反正不上他们的当”。结果捎地的胜利了，地主们和捎地的对半分成，自己掏负担。
    四三年的大灾荒，自然先降临到穷人身上。为救活群众，共产党抗日政府帮助穷人向余粮户借粮。从此兰玉才体验到：原来共产党最关心穷人。不久，兰玉觉悟逐渐提高，便加入了中国共产党。
    灾荒愈来愈严重，人们都在死亡线上挣扎着。到冬天，政府贷给兰玉五百块钱买小车，他参加了推公粮的运输队。车还未买到，敌人把村围住，他被捕了！
    不管野兽般的日寇如何百般拷打，要兰玉招认是共产党，兰玉至死也不承认的。吊、打、灌凉水、刺刀顶胸膛，兰玉没有暴露一点党的秘密和公粮的储藏地。他想：“日本鬼子反正是不讲理的，说也是死，不说也是死，干脆不说，一人死了不打紧，千万别连累了别人。鬼子见到他这么倔强，几番暴跳地把他弄得死去活来，却仍然得不到半句实话；结果把他释放了。
    兰玉带着满身的伤痕回到自己的村庄，他燃起了复仇的火焰，老刘教的“不抗日活不成”的歌子回旋于他的脑际，懊悔当初不听老刘的话。他想：欲报此仇，非参加八路军不可，遂决心参军；但饥饿的老婆孩子拉着了腿，未能如愿。
    身体没有参加八路军，脑筋可是参加八路军了。兰玉想：凡是八路军说的话我就听，办的事我就赞成，用着老百姓的时候我就去；叫他们痛痛快快的打鬼子，出我这心头之恨。此后，从不多事的兰玉便常常在抬伤兵、带路等场合下显露身手了。
    话又说回来，兰玉逃出了敌人的虎口，却仍未跳出饥饿的苦海。家里的破东烂西，折卖折卖买了辆破车，他就一趟趟的运起公粮来；救活了大家，也救活了自己。
    暖和的春风吹开了凝冻的田野，广大群众忧虑着，认为长久灾荒，种地吧眼前就没的吃。这时候，共产党和政府发出了号召，政府发支持粮，并贷种籽，要大量种地。毛主席号召“组织起来”，提高生产。这两个号召深深打动圣佛堂农民的心，都觉着几千年以来，从没有过这样的党和政府。兰玉和石德才一起，由运输队变为互助组。兰玉想：共产党毛主席真是穷人的救命星啊！操持的又周到，想的法又高明；好好的当个党员吧，党说啥我听啥，毛主席号召啥，我做啥。
    岁月如流，四四年忽忽过去了，兰玉和石德才在民主政府的领导下，凭着自己的劳动，跳出了饥饿的深渊。在一年的生产当中，得到一些互助经验，锻炼出一批坚强的互助组长；兰玉便是其中之一。
    兰玉的互助组是得过奖牛的模范组，因此，四五年他就被大家选为互助队长了。有一次村里两个队都到马落堡去刨树，兰玉操持得周到些，带米做饭，没有挨饿。高文槐队未带去米，找着兰玉设法，兰玉说：“我不是你那队的队长，我不管”。闹得文槐队里的人很不满。兰玉今年对此事虚心的检讨说：“那是我的心眼窄，犯了这个偏向。”接着他又说：“那会咱不知道这些，又不出村开个会，又没人说；满以为把咱那队搞好就得了。今年当了农会主任，不断到县里、区里去开会，心眼明白了，那可是一个大偏向，今后凡是农会的事、村里的事，只要找着我，我都得办。”
    去年八月鬼子投降的时候，兰玉高兴的不知说什么好，为了反攻，解除日寇武装，上级布置了扩军任务以后，兰玉便到东葛村找对象，葛村没希望，又到李园，还是没希望。他想起油房姑姑家的小孩子，年青力壮，可以参军，便一气跑到油坊姑姑家去。
    当村里进行减租减息时，耿玉年是个高利贷者，他死后家产由后娘生的第三个儿子继承了，大儿二儿是凭劳动起家的殷实中农。在清算耿玉年的退息中，人们都是主张三个儿伙摊。兰玉认为玉年的家产既是后娘的儿子承继了，就应该他一人摊。这个意见虽当时未为大家所采纳，可是区里检查的结果，还是照着兰玉的意见处理。
    两年多的生产互助，和去年的减租减息，兰玉的生活大大改善了。今年盖了三间西屋，满共才三口人，地已够五十四亩了。他不是吝啬的人，他想：要不是共产党、毛主席、八路军、民主政府，那能过到这样光景。交公粮的时候，兰玉率领他的互助组半夜召开村长的门，将搞副业挣的一叠叠的票子交给村长，战士张百林叫媳妇没盘川，兰玉慷慨的帮助他六百块。
    兰玉说：“思想一年一年的变，有吃有喝有住有穿，不干工作干啥？咱的地是从那里来的？是谁叫咱翻身的？要不是共产党、毛主席、穷捎地的八辈子也休想翻身啊！”的确是，兰玉自从去冬被选为农会主任后，对一切工作都是竞竞业业完成了的。
    “七一”党的二十五周年到来了，兰玉对于自己的党是充满着光明的胜利信心。他说：“咱共产党光给老百姓办好事，谁也拥护；不拥护的只有那些少数吃人的大恶霸地主和汉奸；只要有老百姓赞成，又有毛主席领导，咱共产党一定会成功的”。
    当我麦后访问他的时候，他问我南边和国民党打的怎么样？我故意的逼他说：“咱害怕吗”？他正颜厉色的说：“别说他（指国民党反动派）来不到咱这里，要是来到，咱拉起来就和他干，不愁把他消灭不了”。
