Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 1st. The cultural circles of Zhangjiakou sent a telegram to Mr. Ma Xulun and others, stating: You represent the firm will of the broad masses of Shanghai in demanding peace and democracy, and petitioned in Nanjing, but were insulted and beaten by Kuomintang secret agents. We are extremely saddened and indignant upon hearing this! Currently, the people of our country are eager for peace, but the Kuomintang’s Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government is inherently bellicose, disregarding the interests of the country and the nation, creating civil war, colluding with American reactionaries, and slaughtering the Chinese people. The urgency of the situation is greater than ever before. Your petition in Nanjing not only represents the demands of the Shanghai compatriots but also represents the wishes of the people of the whole country. In addition to extending our condolences to the injured gentlemen, we hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together and take practical actions to protest the Kuomintang's heinous crimes, demand severe punishment for the secret agent murderers, stop the civil war, and achieve peace. We will not stop until we achieve our goal! The signatories include Ding Ling, Ding Li, Yu Li, Gu Yuan, Cheng Fangwu, Ai Qing, Shakov, Li Huan, Zhou Yang, Zhou Weizhi, Chen Qixia, Deng Tuo, Xiao San, and others.
