　　CCP Delegation Sends Letter to Chiang Kai-shek
    Protesting Unauthorized Setting of National Assembly Date
    CCP is Not Bound by Any Unilateral Decision
    Zhou Enlai Proposes Specific Suggestions for Ceasefire in Northern Hubei
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 14th: Regarding the issue of convening the National Assembly, the Nanjing CCP delegation submitted a written protest to the KMT representatives of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and Chiang Kai-shek on the 7th. The original text is as follows:
    To Messrs. Zhesheng, Tiecheng, Lizi, Weilei, Xueting, Lifu, and Lisheng, and forwarded to Chairman Chiang for his consideration: Respectfully, the date for convening the National Assembly was originally one of the matters resolved by the PCC. Later, the postponement was announced by the government after Chairman Chiang consulted the PCC Comprehensive Group. At that time, Member Fu Sinian suggested setting a date for the convening, but Chairman Chiang did not accept it on the grounds that it was inconvenient to set a date before the issues related to the National Assembly were resolved. Seventy days have passed, and not only have the issues related to the National Assembly not been resolved as before, but they have not even been discussed once.
    On the 3rd of this month, the Supreme National Defense Council, a one-party ruling organ of the Kuomintang, unilaterally decided to convene the National Assembly on November 12th of this year. Upon hearing this, we were extremely surprised and immediately and repeatedly requested the prompt opening of the PCC Comprehensive Group to discuss this matter, but we did not receive your consent, and the National Government promulgated an order on the 4th of this month. Does this action of yours indicate that you do not care about the opinions of the various parties, or that you will disregard the PCC, which cannot but cause doubts! The PCC resolutions were solemnly voted on by Chairman Chiang and representatives of all parties (including KMT representatives), and any revisions must be agreed upon by all parties. Your expression is completely contrary to the spirit of consultation, and we firmly oppose it. We hereby solemnly declare to you that before the issues related to the National Assembly are agreed upon, we are not bound by any unilateral decisions of yours, and we still insist on the proposal to promptly open the PCC Comprehensive Group to discuss the National Assembly and its related issues. If you continue to refuse and cause disputes as a result, you shall bear the responsibility. Respectfully submitted, with best wishes!
    Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Ye Jianying, Wu Yuzhang, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, Li Weihan, July 7th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: According to a United Press report from Nanjing on the 13th: CCP General Zhou Enlai has submitted two suggestions to Chiang Kai-shek regarding the ceasefire in northern Hubei. Zhou's suggestions were submitted through Marshall. It is claimed that Zhou suggested that Chiang give the Communist Party… (nine characters missing) on the border of Henan and Hubei, or allow the CCP army to withdraw from the area to join the CCP army in other parts of North China. Chiang has not yet responded.

　　中共代表团致函蒋介石
    抗议擅定国大日期
    中共不受任何片面决定拘束
    周恩来提出鄂北停战具体建议
    【新华社南京十四日电】关于国民大会召开问题，南京中共代表团于七日曾对政协国民党代表及蒋介石提出书面抗议，原文如下：
    哲生、铁城、力子、畏垒、雪艇、立夫、厉生公鉴，并转陈蒋主席赐鉴：敬启者：国大召开日期，原为政协议决事项之一，尔后延期，蒋主席亦曾征询政协综合小组同意，政府始行公布延期命令。当时傅会员斯年提议，定一召集日期，蒋主席以国大有关诸问题未商妥前，不便定一会期，未予接受。阅时七十日，有关国大诸问题不仅未商妥如故，并且从未一商。
    本月三日国民党一党执政机关之国防最高委员会，片面决定召集国大日期为本年十一月十二日，敝方闻之，不胜诧异，当即一再要求速开政协综合小组，商讨此事，乃未获贵方同意，而国民政府已于本月四日明令公布。贵方此种举动，是否表示不管各党派意见如何，抑或将置政协于不顾，不能不令人滋生疑虑！查政协决议曾经蒋主席与各方代表（包括国民党代表在内）庄严起立表决，如有修改，亦须得各方同意。贵方表示若此，完全违反协商精神，敝方坚决反对。兹向贵方郑重声明：关于国大诸问题在未得协议以前，敝方不受贵方任何片面决定之拘束，并仍坚持速开政协综合小组，商讨国大及其有关问题之主张。贵方如仍加以拒绝，并因此而引起纠纷，其责任应由贵方负之。专此奉达，敬颂公祺！
    周恩来、董必武、叶剑英、吴玉章、陆定一、邓颖超、李维汉启  七月七日。
    【新华社延安十四日电】据合众社南京十三日电：中共周恩来将军对于鄂北停战事，已向蒋介石提出两种建议。周氏建议系经过马歇尔提出的，据称：周建议蒋在豫鄂边境给共产党……（中缺九字）或让中共军自该区自动撤出，以与华北其他部分中共军会合，蒋尚未答复。
