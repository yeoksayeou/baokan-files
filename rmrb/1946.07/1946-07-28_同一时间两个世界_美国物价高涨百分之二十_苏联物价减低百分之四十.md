　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 25th: Prices in the United States and the Soviet Union are currently developing in opposite directions. According to a report in the Shanghai United Evening News on July 8th, general prices in the United States rose by 7.7% to 20.6% on July 1st. Bowles, director of the US Office of Economic Stabilization, estimated that if prices continue to rise, the cost of living could double in 20 days. At the same time, the Soviet Ministry of Trade announced that from July 2nd, the prices of consumer goods would be reduced again, by a minimum of 37% and a maximum of 77%, with an average reduction of 40%.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 22nd: Washington reports that US government officials said on the evening of the 20th that Truman has indicated he will accept the compromise plan of the Office of Price Administration. According to the plan, price controls will be suspended for 30 days, but will then be automatically restored. This compromise was submitted to Truman by former Price Administrator Porter. It is also learned that Truman declared at a press conference on the 19th that prices will continue to rise unless Congress passes a bill restoring the Office of Price Administration. The stalemate in Congress regarding price control policy has not yet been broken. After four days of non-stop discussion on price control measures, members of the House and Senate met again on the 20th in an attempt to reach an agreement acceptable to both houses of Congress and Truman.

　　同一时间两个世界
    美国物价高涨百分之二十
    苏联物价减低百分之四十
    【新华社延安二十五日电】美苏两国物价，现正向相反方向发展。据沪联合晚刊七月八日消息：美国一般物价在七月一日上涨百分之七点七至百分之二十点六。美经济稳定局局长鲍尔斯曾估计说：如物价继续上涨，则二十天内生活费可能增加一倍。与这同时，苏联贸易部则宣布称：七月二日起，各消费品价格再度减低，最少减低百分之三十七，最多减低百分之七十七，平均减低百分之四十。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】华府讯：美政府官员于二十日晚称：杜鲁门已表示将接受物价管理局之折衷方案。根据该方案，物价管制将停止三十天，但以后将自动恢复。此折衷案为前物价管理局长波特提交杜鲁门者。又悉杜鲁门曾于十九日在记者会上宣称：除非国会通过恢复物价管制局法案，否则物价将继续上涨。而国会方面目前对物价管制政策之僵局，尚未打破。参众两院议员在对物价管制措施作四日不停地讨论后，二十日又开会，企图达成为参众两院及杜鲁门双方所能接受的协议。
