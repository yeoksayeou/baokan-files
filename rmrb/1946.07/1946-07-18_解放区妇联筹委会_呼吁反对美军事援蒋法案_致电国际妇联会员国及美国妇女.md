Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. The Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China has sent telegrams to women in member states of the International Women's Federation and American women, calling for joint opposition to the US military aid bill to China, which is fueling the Chinese civil war. The original telegram is as follows:

(1) Telegram to the International Women's Federation:

To the International Women's Federation and all sister organizations in member states:

Under the manipulation of reactionary elements in the United States, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the US House of Representatives has passed the bill for continued military aid to China. In this era of world peace and democracy, this measure will greatly support Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule, encourage the Chinese reactionaries to launch a full-scale and protracted civil war, and seriously hinder the Chinese people's movement for peace, democracy, and independence. This not only violates President Truman's statement on China policy last December, but also undermines the principles of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference agreement on China. Chinese women firmly oppose this bill, because it not only endangers peace and democracy in China, but also harms peace in the Far East and the world. We hope that the sisters in all member states will unite and mobilize all forces to demand that the US government immediately cancel this aid to China bill, immediately stop and withdraw all military aid to China, and withdraw US troops stationed in China.

Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China,
July 12, 1946.

(2) Telegram to American Women:

Dear American sisters:

The friendship between the people of China and the United States has always been profound. Last December, your President Truman announced a policy of non-interference in China, hoping for peaceful unification and the establishment of a democratic coalition government. The Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers, in which your Secretary of State participated, also signed an agreement on the Chinese question. Now, not only has a democratic coalition government not been established in China, but on the contrary, the Kuomintang dictatorial government is expanding and prolonging the heinous civil war, and persisting in fascist autocracy and dictatorship. The ten-year military aid to China bill passed by your House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee actually promotes Chiang Kai-shek's civil war and dictatorial policy, undermines the Chinese people's movement for peace, democracy and independence, and damages the friendship between the people of China and the United States. We hope that you will call on the broad masses of the American people to demand that the government immediately cancel the military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill, stop and withdraw all military aid to China, and withdraw the US naval, land and air forces stationed in China.

Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas of China,
July 12, 1946.

　　解放区妇联筹委会
    呼吁反对美军事援蒋法案
    致电国际妇联会员国及美国妇女
    【新华社延安十四日电】中国解放区妇女联合会筹委会顷致电国际妇联会员国妇女及美国妇女，呼吁共同反对美国当局助长中国内战的军事援华法案。原电如下：
    （一）致国际妇联电：
    国际妇女联合会并转各会员国姐妹们：
    在美国反动分子操纵下，美国众院外交委员会已经通过了继续军事援华法案，在世界和平民主的时代，这一措施将大大支持蒋介石的独裁统治，鼓励中国反动派发动全面的长期内战，严重地阻碍中国人民的和平民主独立运动，这不仅违背去年十二月杜鲁门总统对华政策的声明，并破坏了莫斯科三国外长会议关于中国问题协议的原则。中国妇女坚决反对这一法案，因为这不仅危害中国的和平与民主，而且使远东和世界的和平受到损害，希望各会员国的姐妹们，团结一致动员一切力量要求美国政府立即取消这一援华法案，立即停止并收回对华一切军事援助，并撤退驻华美国军队。
    中国解放区妇女联合会筹委会，
    一九四六年七月十二日。
    （二）致美国妇女电：
    亲爱的美国姐妹们：
    中美两国人民友谊，素称深厚，贵国杜鲁门总统去年十二月曾宣布对华不干涉政策，希望中国和平统一，成立民主联合政府。贵国国务卿所参加的莫斯科三国外长会议，也曾签署关于中国问题的协议。现在中国不但民主联合政府没有成立，相反的，中国国民党独裁政府正在扩大并延长万恶的内战，坚持法西斯专制独裁。贵国众议院外交委员会所通过的十年军事援华法案，实际上助长了蒋介石的内战与独裁政策，破坏了中国人民的和平民主独立运动，使中美两国人民友谊受到损害，希望你们号召美国广大人民起来，要求政府立即取消军事援蒋法案，停止并收回对华一切军事援助，撤退驻华美海陆空军。
    中国解放区妇女联合会筹委会，
    一九四六年七月十二日。
