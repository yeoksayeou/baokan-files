[Weixian, 25th dispatch] Jinnan regions are celebrating the welcome rain. As of yesterday, twenty-five of the region's forty-five counties have received rain, including Weixian, Nangong, Guangzong, Yaoshan, Ningnan, Nanhe, Julu, Longping, Xinhe in the Fourth District; Tianjin, Wucheng, Gucheng, Qinghe in the Second District; Guanxian, Yuancheng, Linqing in the First District; Daming, Yongnian, Handan, Quzhou in the Third District; Jingxian, Fudong, Zaoqiang, Jixian, Wuyi in the Fifth District, and others. Local farmers are rejoicing and, under the leadership of the democratic government, are rushing to plant late autumn crops – buckwheat, radishes, and small vegetables. People and livestock are everywhere in the fields, forming a lively rush planting movement. However, the area covered by this rainfall is still not widespread, and the amount of rainfall is also uneven. Therefore, the leadership should urgently follow the instructions of the Border Region Government, continue to deepen disaster prevention and famine preparedness work, educate the masses to practice thrift, and actively seek ways to increase production.

Another dispatch: In Guangzong Fifth District, Jinnan, due to the lack of thorough rain for two months, many seedlings have withered. Although a large amount of rain has recently fallen, it is estimated that only half of the harvest will be obtained. The district held a cadre meeting on the 12th of this month to determine that the focus of work in the second half of the year will be on production, conservation, and famine preparedness. Peasants are mobilized to help each other develop various sideline productions. Leaching saltpeter and collecting firewood are the major sideline productions in the district. Leaching saltpeter can earn an average of seven to eight hundred yuan per person per day, which can buy more than one dou of millet at current market prices. Collecting firewood can earn an average of four to five hundred yuan per person per day. In Zhang Village, one mutual aid group earned more than ten thousand yuan from selling firewood alone in less than a month. In addition, the masses are organized to collect wild vegetables and practice strict economy. The masses all say: "Only the democratic government cares about us like this. Listening to the democratic government ensures that we won't starve to death." They are all actively engaged in the production and self-rescue movement.

　　冀南二十五县庆获甘雨
    农民欣奋抢种晚秋         
    广宗五区开展副业加紧备荒
    【威县二十五日电】冀南各地庆获喜雨。截至昨日止，该区四十五个县分中已有二十五个县得雨，计有四分区之威县、南宫、广宗、尧山、宁南、南和、巨鹿、隆平、新河，二分区之天津、武城、故城、清河，一分区之冠县、元城、临清，三分区之大名、永年、邯郸、曲周，五分区景县、阜东、枣强、冀县、武邑等。当地农民欢欣鼓舞，正在民主政府领导下，抢种晚秋——荞麦、萝卜和小菜，人畜遍野，形成一热烈的抢种运动。唯此次下雨之面积仍不普遍，雨量大小亦不均匀。因此，领导上亟应根据边府指示，继续深入防灾备荒工作，教育群众节衣缩食，并从积极方面寻求生产之道。
    又电：冀南广宗五区，因两月来未下透雨，不少青苗已枯死，最近虽得大量雨水，估计也只能有一半收成，区上特于本月十二日召开干部会，确定下半年以生产节约备荒为工作中心。发动农民互助开展各种副业生产，淋硝盐与拾柴为该区副业生产之大宗。淋硝盐每人每天平均可得七八百元，按现有市价可买一斗多小米，拾柴每人每天平均可收入四、五百元。张村一个互助组不及一个月，仅卖柴一项即得一万余元。此外，并组织群众采集野菜及厉行节约。群众都说：“只有民主政府才这样关心咱们，听民主政府的话保险饿不死”。均纷纷投入生产自救运动中。
