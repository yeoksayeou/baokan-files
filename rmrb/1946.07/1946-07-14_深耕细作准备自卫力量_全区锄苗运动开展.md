　　Deeply Cultivate and Prepare Self-Defense Forces
　  District-Wide Weeding Campaign Unfolds
[Our newspaper, Handan News] A district-wide weeding campaign is being widely carried out. In the Taiyue District, spring and summer rains have been timely, and grain seedlings have grown to one and a half feet. On the 2nd and 3rd of this month, the entire district received another thorough rain, and farmers are now enthusiastically carrying out the second weeding. In Yangcheng County, out of 189,280 mu of grain fields and 34,024 mu of cotton fields, 50% have already been weeded for the second time. After obtaining land, the farmers in Jinnan are now enthusiastically carrying out the third weeding. In Jize, more than 2,600 mu of autumn seedlings have been weeded three times. The Wang Chaozhu mutual aid team in Jiudian Village, Guangzong, is striving to complete the third weeding before "July 7th." Li Mailing Village in the Yuan Dynasty weeded 202 mu and planted 129 mu of late seedlings in nine days. Many villages discussed methods of calculating work points and exchanging labor, as well as weeding plans, before starting the weeding process. In Fuxinzhuang Village, Qiuxian County, work points for weeding are calculated in three grades. Fields with many weeds and dense seedlings that are difficult to weed are considered first grade, with one labor point earned for weeding six fen of land per day; fields with few weeds and sparse seedlings that are easy to weed are considered third grade, with one labor point earned for weeding eight fen of land per day; fields that are easier to weed than first grade but more difficult than third grade are considered second grade, with one labor point earned for weeding seven fen of land per day. Discussions were also held regarding distances from the village and labor exchange between men and women. The village also initiated a weeding competition. Li Xingcheng proposed to Guo Siyi's group that his group, with 1.6 hectares of spring land and five laborers, would guarantee to weed the cotton and sorghum once in five days. Women are playing a significant role in the large-scale weeding campaign. In Caoting Village, Zuoquan, Taihang, all 49 young and middle-aged women participated in the weeding, and women weeded the first round of corn and millet. Women can be seen everywhere in the fields, pulling seedlings. Zhang Xiaoni, a woman from Xuhan Village, Jingxing, weeded 39 mu during the wheat harvest and seedling pulling. All 180 women in Zhangjing Village, Pingshun, participated in the seedling pulling.
