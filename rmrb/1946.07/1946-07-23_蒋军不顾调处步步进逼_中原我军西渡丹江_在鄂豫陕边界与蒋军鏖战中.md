Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 20th Urgent Telegram: Military News: Although the Hankou Executive Headquarters has repeatedly requested a ceasefire, Chiang's troops are still concentrating a large number of troops to form a new encirclement around the main force of Li Xiannian's troops breaking through, north of the Han River, south of Jingziguan, and between Xichuan and Yunxi. This not only makes mediation impossible, but also makes the war situation increasingly serious. In addition to the eight divisions of Chiang's troops originally pursuing, one division each from Hu Zongnan's First Army and Ninetieth Army, and two divisions from the Ninety-sixth Army have been added, representing the largest and most extensive encirclement by Chiang's troops since the westward pursuit. Since the main force of Li's troops broke through to the area south of Nanyang, including Deng County and Xinye, they have been continuously pursued by Chiang's troops. They had no choice but to move to the Zhenping, Neixiang, and Xichuan areas west of Nanyang. Chiang Kai-shek hastily transferred Hu Zongnan's Ninetieth Army south to block us and dispatched a large number of aircraft for bombing. After a fierce battle, Li's troops were forced to cross the Dan River westward on the 13th and 14th (the Dan River is a tributary of the Han River, flowing through the west side of Xichuan and south of Jingziguan). At this time, Hu Zongnan's First Army was ordered by Chiang to attack us from Jingziguan. By the 16th, Chiang's troops launched a general offensive against us. On the east side, the main force of the Forty-first Army and the 125th Division of the Forty-seventh Army were pursuing us from Xichuan, and on the 16th and 17th, they had captured Wanghe and Meijiapu, west of Xichuan, and were attacking our troops in the North Tang and Huliyu areas to the west. On the north side, the 122nd Division of the Forty-first Army crossed the Dan River from Dashiqiao, northwest of Xichuan, and cooperated with Hu Zongnan's First Army and Ninetieth Army to attack our troops in the Baoyuling area south of Jingziguan. On the south side, the main force of the Third Army and the 135th Division of the Fifteenth Army, in addition to blockading the line from Yunyang to Yunxi east of the Han River, advanced from Yunyang to the dangerous and narrow areas of Zhaojiachuan and Shilibing, west of Jingziguan. At the same time, one division of the Seventy-sixth Army arrived at Mancheng Pass, northwest of Yunxi and on the border of Hubei and Shaanxi, from Xi'an, and another division arrived at Ankang, west of Yunxi, from Baoji, to prevent our westward movement. The main force of the Fifteenth Army crossed the river from Laohekou and advanced fiercely towards Jun County on the south bank of the Han River, attempting to construct a second blockade line south of the Han River. Currently, Chiang's troops from all directions are fiercely attacking our troops surrounded on the west side of the Dan River, between Jingziguan, Yunyang, and Yunxi, and the battle is very tense.

　　蒋军不顾调处步步进逼
    中原我军西渡丹江
            在鄂豫陕边界与蒋军鏖战中
    【新华社中原某地二十日急电】军息：汉口执行小组虽一再要求停战，但蒋军仍集中大量兵力，对李先念部突围主力在汉水以北，荆紫关以南，淅川与郧西之间地区，形成新的包围，不但使调处无法进行，且战争形势正日趋于严重。蒋军原追击部队八个师外，又新增胡宗南之第一军与九十军各一个师，及九十六军两个师，为蒋军西追以来集中兵力最多，规模最大之围攻。自李部主力突围至南阳以南邓县、新野地区后，又不断遭受蒋军追击，不得已乃转至南阳以西镇平、内乡、淅川一带，蒋介石即匆忙增调胡宗南九十军南开，向我堵击，并出动大批飞机轰炸。李部力战后，始于十三、十四日被迫越过丹江西进（丹江为汉水支流，流贯淅川西侧及荆紫关之南），此时胡宗南部第一军又奉蒋令由荆紫关方面向我出击。至十六日蒋军各部复向我发动总进攻，东面为由淅川方面向我追击之四十一军主力，及四十七军一二五师，十六、十七两日已攻占淅川西之王河、梅家铺等地，乃分别西向南北塘、狐狸垭方面我军进攻。北面为四十一军一二二师，自淅川西北大石桥渡过丹江，配合胡宗南之第一军、九十军向荆紫关南之鲍鱼岭一带我军进攻。南面为第三军主力及十五军一三五师，除封锁汉水以东郧阳至郧西一线外，并自郧阳向荆紫关以西之赵家川、十里坪一带山险隘地前进。同时，七十六军一个师自西安开抵郧西西北、鄂陕交界处之漫川关，另一个师自宝鸡开至郧西西面之安康，阻我西移。十五军主力则自老河口渡河，向汉水南岸均县方面猛进，企图在汉水以南构成第二道封锁线。现蒋军各路正向被围于丹江西侧、荆紫关、郧阳、郧西之间的我军猛烈进攻，战事十分紧张。
