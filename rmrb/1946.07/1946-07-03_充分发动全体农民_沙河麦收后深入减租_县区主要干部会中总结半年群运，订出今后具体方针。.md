[Reported from Xingtai by our newspaper] With the completion of the wheat harvest in Shahe County, the county specially convened a meeting of key county and district cadres to summarize and review the mass movement work of the past six months, discuss how to immediately continue to deepen rent reduction, and specifically decide on the direction and practices for the future. Before the wheat harvest, of the 168 villages in a certain district of the county, 82 villages had already shifted from anti-traitor rent reduction to production, 52 villages were deepening the movement, and 74 villages (mostly small mountain villages) had not yet been mobilized, with feudal forces still dominating. The first type of village had not integrated the resolution of outstanding issues well with production, and simply emphasized in-depth and minor issues, making the movement weak and ineffective. The second type of village had three problems hindering the development of the movement: 1. The fruits of struggle were sometimes unfairly distributed, or they were not distributed for a long time, causing contradictions between the masses and the cadres. 2. Bad elements were regarded as activists and were not promptly purged, with the mistaken belief that this was only a matter of work style. As a result, individual bad people exploited loopholes, engaged in indiscriminate struggle among the masses, attacked middle peasants, and divided the unity of the masses, causing the mass movement to fall into chaos. 3. Some village cadres were bought off by landlords with money and women, were fooled by landlords, shielded landlords, and did not lead the peasants to liberate themselves. The third type of village was mainly considered by the leadership to be unimportant small villages and were not led. Based on the above situation, the meeting has formulated specific guidelines for the future for each type of village. The first type of village should combine production with rent reduction, with the slogans "Unite for liberation, unite for production" and "Liberation struggle digs out the roots of poverty, mutual aid in production lays the foundation for wealth." The second type of village should immediately distribute the fruits of struggle, transform cadres, repel the landlord counterattack, and further deepen the movement. The third type of village should absorb the experience of advanced villages in anti-traitor rent reduction and boldly mobilize the masses. Finally, the meeting also focused on studying three issues. 1. It was recognized that middle peasants do not exploit people economically and do not oppress people politically, and it is wrong to attack middle peasants. It was proposed that if middle peasants have been struggled against, things should be returned, or other ways should be found to compensate. In the future, it is necessary to unite middle peasants to participate in the struggle and appropriately distribute the fruits of struggle to strengthen peasant unity and expand peasant strength. 2. Regarding the distribution of the fruits of struggle, the fruits of struggle are the blood and sweat that the masses were exploited by landlords, and the masses should make the decisions on distribution. We must learn from the distribution methods of North Street in the city, with poor peasants getting more land, middle peasants getting things, those with good land getting bad land, those without good land getting good land, and those with livestock lacking grass getting alfalfa land. A small restaurant owner was allocated half an acre of vegetable land, and he was very happy. In addition, if the fruits are unfairly distributed or village cadres get too much, they should be educated to clear their minds, and the masses should discuss and redistribute them. 3. Those who have worked for the enemy and puppets in the past and cannot be reformed must be resolutely purged. For cadres who have been bought off by landlords, we should not take the approach of attacking them, but should enlighten them and help them to reflect. These comrades can be changed for the better. For example, when the village chief of Beiliu Village was bought off by a landlord, the leadership immediately said to him: "Why are the landlords giving us things now? Why didn't they pay attention to us in the past?" He did not confess at the time but lowered his head and was unhappy. He could not sleep at night when he returned home, and the next morning he went to the district cadres to confess and repent.

　　充分发动全体农民
    沙河麦收后深入减租
    县区主要干部会中总结半年群运，订出今后具体方针。
    【本报邢台讯】沙河麦收完成，该县特召开主要县区干部会议，总结与检查半年群运工作，讨论如何立即继续深入减租，并具体决定了今后的方向与做法。麦收前该县某区共一百六十八个村，现已有八十二个村由反奸减租转入生产，五十二个村运动走向深入，七十四个村（大部是小村山庄）还没有发动起来，封建势力还占着优势。第一类村解决遗留问题没有与生产结合好，单纯强调深入细小问题，使运动软弱无力，第二类村有三个问题阻碍了运动的发展，一、斗争果实有的分配不公，有的是迟迟不分，引起群众与干部的矛盾。二、把坏分子当成积极分子，没有及时清洗出去，以为这仅是作风问题。结果被个别坏人钻了空子，在群众中乱斗，打击中农，分裂群众团结，使群运陷于混乱。三、有些村干部被地主用金钱美女收买，上了地主当，包庇地主，不领导农民翻身。第三类村主要是领导上认为是小村无足轻重，没有领导。根据以上情况，会议对各类村已订出今后具体方针，第一类村是生产应与减租结合，口号是“团结翻身，团结生产”，“翻身斗争挖出穷根，生产互助扎下富根”。第二类村是应当即时分配斗争果实，改造干部，打退地主反攻，进一步深入运动。第三类村应吸收先进村反奸减租经验，大胆发动群众，最后，该会并集中研究了三个问题。一、认识了中农在经济上不剥削人，在政治上不压迫人，对中农打击是不对的。提出如果中农被斗争了，应退还东西，或想其他的办法弥补，今后一定要团结中农参加斗争，并适当分配斗争果实，以加强农民团结，壮大农民力量，二、分配斗争果实问题，斗争果实是群众被地主剥削的血汗，应由群众作主分配，要学习城内北街的分配办法，贫农多分地，中农可以分东西，有好地的分赖地，没有好地分好地，有牲口缺草者分配苜蓿地，一个开小饭铺的给他分配了半亩菜地，他非常高兴。此外果实分配不公或村干部分的多的，要经过教育打通思想，通过群众讨论重新分配。三、对过去给敌伪做过事的分子，不能改造的，要坚决清洗出去。对被地主收买的干部，不能采取打击办法，应启发其觉悟并帮助其反省，这些同志是能够变好的，如果北留村村长受了地主收买，领导上即和他讲：“地主为啥现在给咱东西，过去人家为啥不理咱呢？”他当时没有坦白，但低着头闷闷不乐，回家夜里也睡不着觉到第二天一早便找区干部坦白悔悟了。
