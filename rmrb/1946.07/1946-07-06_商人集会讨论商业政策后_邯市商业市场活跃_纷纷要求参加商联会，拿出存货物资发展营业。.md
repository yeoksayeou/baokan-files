[Report from our newspaper in Handan] Following a meeting of merchants from various industries in the city, organized by the Preparatory Committee of the Handan Commercial Association, which concluded successfully after twenty days of discussion and research, merchants have come to understand the spirit of the government's commercial policies. Concerns about being struggled against or having to increase capital have been dispelled, and they are determined to develop their businesses without reservation. Based on the report on industrial and commercial policies by Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government and the draft charter of the Commercial Association, discussions were conducted through industry-wide meetings, group meetings, and individual conversations. The first questions raised by the merchants were: "Is the government's policy of developing industry and commerce real?" "Why aren't merchants being struggled against?" Pei Zengren of ×× store said, "To see if the government's policies are real, first look at our current situation and then look at the situation during the enemy and puppet regime!" Pei Huanxiang of Juheng Store said, "There's no need to compare; it's like heaven and earth! Now that the government is in charge, no one dares to extort merchants. In the past, because we had some money, we were taken advantage of by traitors and secret agents, and we didn't dare to do business boldly." Merchants have gained a deeper understanding and trust in the policies of the democratic government. Tian Jiming, chairman of the Cotton Industry Association, said, "Those who are afraid of struggle should first see if they are big traitors, secret agents, or evil landlords. If not, there's nothing to fear!"
    Next, the discussion focused on "Why increase capital? Why raise the status of shop assistants?" Du Shanzheng, manager of Fuji Goods Station, said, "Only when the meat is fat can the soup be fat," and used his vivid experience of automatically negotiating capital increases to illustrate that this is the only way to achieve labor-capital cooperation and mutual benefit. He said, "In the past, my electrical supplies and lumber mill didn't work in the afternoon. After increasing capital, everyone actively prepared for the afternoon work, and when they heard that lumber was cheap somewhere, they would automatically go and buy it back."
    Through these discussions, everyone's understanding became clearer from practical experience. After the meeting, Hou Feng Counter automatically provided clothing for three apprentices and responded to the call of the seven wine businesses in Handan to automatically increase wages to 160 to 220 jin of millet. Wan Zhongsan, manager of the grain store, called on each grain store to store tens of thousands of jin of grain to help the government regulate prices. The Commercial Association is now preparing to establish exchanges and cooperatives to revitalize the market. Many merchants have brought back goods and funds that were previously stored elsewhere, and Handan's commercial and financial markets are becoming increasingly active. Merchants are requesting that their qualifications be reviewed so they can join the Commercial Association and are proposing that the work of the shop assistants' union be carried out quickly to coordinate with the Commercial Association to solve the issue of wage increases in a unified manner, so as to develop businesses more quickly.

[Report from our newspaper] The Handan Commercial Association recently formulated the following draft work program for the association:
    1. Unite and help each other, abide by government laws and industrial and commercial policies, and solve the difficulties in the development of industry and commerce to prosper the city.
    2. Support poor members, solve capital difficulties, and assist in business development.
    3. Mediate labor-capital relations, appropriately improve the lives of shop assistants, raise the status of shop assistants, and ensure enthusiastic management and obedience to business guidance.

    5. Launch shipbuilding, organize transportation, to facilitate transportation, adjust materials, and stabilize prices.
    6. Call on merchants who have left to return to their hometowns, help restore business, and strive for industrialists and businessmen from other regions to come to the city to operate and invest.

　　商人集会讨论商业政策后
    邯市商业市场活跃
    纷纷要求参加商联会，拿出存货物资发展营业。
    【本报邯郸讯】由本市商联会筹委会主持之本市各业商人会议，经过二十天的讨论研究已圆满结束。经过这次会议商人们认识了政府商业政策的精神，消除了怕斗争、怕增资的顾虑，决心放手发展自己的营业。会议根据边区政府戎副主席工商政策报告，和商联会纲领草案，用各行业大会、小组会、个别漫谈等方式，进行座谈，商人们首先提出的疑问是：“政府发展工商政策是不是真的？”“为啥不斗争商人？”××商店裴增仁说：“要看政府的政策是不是真的，先看看咱们现在的情况怎样，再看敌伪在时的情况又怎样！？聚亨商店裴欢祥说：“这还用比，简直是天上地下！现在政府作主没人敢敲诈商人了，从前因为有几个钱，瞪着眼吃汉奸特务的亏，不敢大胆作生意。”商人们对于民主政府的政策，有了进一步的体会和信任，棉业公会会长田济明说：“谁怕斗争，先看看自己是不是大汉奸、特务、恶霸地主，要不是就不用怕了”！
    接着讨论为“啥要增资？为啥要提高店员地位？”福记货栈经理杜善正说：“肉肥汤才肥”，并用他自动协商增资后的生动经验，说明只有这样才能达到劳资合作、劳资两利。他说：“过去我的电料据木厂里下午都不干活，增资后每天下午大家就积极准备后上开工的东西，听到那里木料便宜就自动去买回来。”
    经过这些讨论大家从实际体验中，认识更加明确，会议后侯峰柜已自动供给三个学徒的衣着，并响应了邯市七家酒业自动增资到小米一百六十斤至二百二十斤。粮店经理万仲三号召每家粮食屯粮几万斤，帮助政府调节物价。商联会现正筹备成立交易所，合作社，以活跃市场。许多商人已将过去存放在外之货物资金拿回，邯市商业和金融市场日渐活跃起来。商人们均纷纷要求审查自己的条件加入商联会，并提出快把店员工会的工作作起来，以便协同商联会统一解决增资问题，以便更快的发展营业。
