　　Resolutely Oppose!
    US Senate Passes Reactionary Bill
    To Give Chiang Kai-shek More Than Two Hundred Warships
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th] United Press International, Washington, 27th: The US Senate has passed a bill authorizing the sale or donation of 271 surplus naval warships to China, and authorizing the dispatch of a naval advisory group to assist the Chiang army in rebuilding its navy. According to the aforementioned bill, any battleships, cruisers, destroyers, or submarines that can be handed over to China will be immediately approved by Congress. The passage of this bill by the US Senate under the manipulation of a group of reactionaries will clearly further fuel the Chinese civil war, endanger the friendship between the Chinese and American people, and is opposed by the broad masses of peace-loving and democratic people in China, the United States, and the world.

　　坚决反对！
    美参院通过反动法案
    以军舰二百余艘予蒋
    【新华社延安三十日电】合众社华盛顿二十七日讯：美参院已通过法案，准以贷款出售或赠送之方式，将剩余之海军军舰二百七十一艘交与中国，并准派海军顾问团协助蒋军重建海军。根据上述法案，如有任何战斗舰巡洋舰驱逐舰或潜水艇等可作交与中国之用者，议会均将立即通过，此一法案已交众院讨论。美国参院在一部分反动分子操纵下，通过此一法案，显将益形助长中国内战，危害中美人民之友谊，而为中美及全世界广大爱好和平民主人民所反对。
