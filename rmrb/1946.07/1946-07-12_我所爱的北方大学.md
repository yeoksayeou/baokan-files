The Northern University I Love
　　Yu Sha

　　　　This is a big family.
　　A fellow student wrote in a poem:
　　“Peking University is a free ocean,
　　Water from everywhere ceaselessly gathers here!”
　　Yes, there are over a thousand students here, some from the Great Rear Area, some from the Tianjin and Northeast areas, some from the old liberated areas, and some from the newly liberated areas. These students live and study together, truly like brothers and sisters! Especially the students from the old liberated areas and those with eight years of anti-Japanese war experience from their work posts, like older brothers, sincerely and warmly care for and help the new students in various ways. A student from Beiping said:
　　“If you don't talk about it, you can't tell at all who has been a cadre for eight years! Unlike the Kuomintang areas, where as soon as you arrive in Beiping, they call the students pseudo-students.”
　　The school is particularly concerned about students from outside. Because they broke through the Kuomintang's blockade lines, some dared not bring luggage, some lost their clothes, and some had no money. The school tries its best to find solutions. It provides quilts and advance clothes to ensure they are in a good mood and can concentrate on their studies.
　　The school's affairs are entirely managed by service staff. Here, it is worth mentioning in particular Comrade Dai Guanfang, the wife of our Principal Fan, who is recognized by us as the "Old Mother." I remember one morning, right after finishing morning exercises, Chen Guang, a new student from Hanzhong Middle School in Shaanxi, and I were about to go outside to the wheat field to read when we ran into her, who was shouting and driving pigs into the yard. Seeing us, she smiled and said, "As soon as I opened the door, the pigs ran out!" We put down our books and helped her drive the pigs into the yard. She pointed to a big pig and said to us, "If we raise it for a few more days, we'll eat it." We all laughed. She continued:
　　“The food isn’t good now, but it will slowly improve. When production increases, it will be better!” Although she is very old and walks somewhat awkwardly, she is never idle from morning to night; helping to feed the pigs, helping to cook in the kitchen… I remember Li Zongtang wrote in a wall poster entitled “I Have a Mother”: He had returned to a warm home, although his biological mother had passed away! But his current mother loves him and cares for him even more than his original mother.
　　Walking out of the school gate, Chen Guang said to me very moved:
　　“How could a university president's wife in the Kuomintang area do these things!” He continued:
　　“In our school in Hanzhong, who cared about improving the food! The principal, in order to profit and save money on hiring cooks, made the students carry rice from the city, which was more than twenty miles away from the school. If you were sick and didn't carry rice for that week, they would deduct your food for that week and not let you eat! Most of the students had no family support, and some didn't even have money for haircuts! In winter, they had no quilts and slept next to the stoves in the kitchen. They couldn't eat enough, they couldn't afford clothes, and no one cared! But the principal made more than twenty million in profit in one year…” His eyes flashed with indignation. After a pause, he smiled gently:
　　“Now the students in our school are truly like brothers and sisters in a big family. Since coming here, I don’t know why I feel so happy! You see, I eat more and more every day.” A smile that couldn’t be concealed appeared at the corners of his mouth. His eyes looked into the distance—as if rejoicing that he had escaped from the Kuomintang-controlled area and thrown himself into this free and warm big family.

　　　　Democratic Style, Mutual Learning
　　Principal Fan said: "We are a revolutionary school, and everything must be done in a democratic style, following the mass line." For example, in terms of our lives: how to make life serious, how to overcome all bad phenomena. In terms of learning: how to set courses, how to stipulate study time, all must be discussed by the students, and then the school will integrate the students' opinions to formulate covenants or timetables, and then implement them separately in accordance with these procedures.
　　Our learning is based on study groups, where we can express our opinions and discuss them without any restraint. In addition to the groups compiled by the school, students also organize themselves to study according to their interests. Such as philosophy, literature and art, foreign languages, mathematics and other groups. Whether it's morning or dusk, a group gathers together, either in the dormitory, or under the shade of a tree in the playground, or in the wheat field, to engage in heated discussions. No matter how different the opinions, we discuss for a day or half a day, and finally seriously come to a conclusion.
　　Once, we held a discussion meeting, discussing what is "truth." Some students said: "Truth is relative, and it is also absolute." Some students said: "Truth evolves with the times. As long as most people in that era think it is right, that is truth." Others said: "No, if it changes, it cannot be called truth. Society moves forward and gets closer to truth. What was considered right in that era cannot be said to be truth." Three different opinions sparked heated debate. The discussion lasted all morning, and even when the meal bell rang, there were still three opposing opinions. Later, one student suggested:
　　"I think even though our contradictions are unified, it is best to invite Professor Chen Weishi…". As a result, some went to invite Professor Chen, and some ran to the kitchen to ask the cook to save them some food. After Professor Chen explained in detail, the students released their tense and enthusiastic mood, breathed a sigh of relief, as if they had completed a major task, and smiled as they dispersed.
　　Our extracurricular activities include singing and acting, …………… In addition to these cultural entertainments, there are wall newspapers. Such as "Life Wall Newspaper", "Learning Newspaper", "Learning Life", "Northern Roar", "Oasis" - a total of more than ten kinds. Some are comprehensive, some are purely literary. These public gardens fully realize what Chairman Mao said: "Say all you know and say it without reservation", freely offering opinions to students and schools. We engage in mutual criticism and self-criticism, so we learn ourselves and help others learn. Therefore, the progress of students here is very fast, regardless of their political or cultural level.
　　Principal Fan said to us in his first speech after coming to the school: "We must not make the mistake of just memorizing books. We must be realistic and learn from each other without being arrogant or stingy. It is not only important to remember the words 'Serve the people wholeheartedly', but more important to implement them in practical actions. For example, if there is anything wrong with me, Fan Wenlan, you can freely make suggestions on the wall newspaper, and I will sincerely accept and correct them. If I really can't serve you wholeheartedly, then you can drive me out……………” At that time, the students applauded with emotion.

　　　　We are all Production Fighters
　　Our school buildings are the former barracks of the enemy. After the enemy left, most of the houses were destroyed. In order to rebuild them as soon as possible, the students went to dig bricks on the ancient Shunde Prefecture city wall in their spare time. Male and female students used drills to dig the bricks out of the city wall, and then threw them down piece by piece. The students below picked up the bricks, loaded the cars, and ten or so people pulled a car to transport them to the new school buildings.
　　The school called for large-scale production - land reclamation. Because our new school buildings have more than two hectares of wasteland. This time we mobilized all the staff and students of the school to reclaim the land, because this is a very large income.
　　On Monday morning, the production committee led the male and female students, carrying plows, hoes, and shovels, and a large production army marched mightily towards the new school buildings!
　　This production was the largest since we came to the school, lasting about five or six days. Not only did we reclaim the land, but we also had to sow the seeds quickly.
　　For a piece of land covered with weeds, we must first turn the soil over, and the air-raid shelters dug by the enemy must also be filled. So the male students pulled the plows, and the female students filled the pits. A long whistle sounded, and the work began!
　　Some students pulling the plows shouted, "Hey! Keep it at ninety degrees…" Other students sang while pulling the plows: "Not afraid of hardship like the sea, not afraid of difficulties like mountains, we face the sun, and always go forward…" This voice carried an invincible force, reaching far away.
　　Zhou Yu from the first group had the best work spirit, and the students admired him very much, giving him a thumbs up and calling him "Labor Hero".
　　Work was alternated with rest. During rest time, many students piled up random bricks, placed wooden poles horizontally, and high jumped. Students in their thirties also played and frolicked with students in their teens, using the ropes for pulling plows to "fly rope walk"!
　　The green wasteland instantly turned into brown new soil - the entire earth was completely immersed in a pleasant atmosphere!

　　我所爱的北方大学
　　予沙
            这是一个大家庭
    一个同学的诗上写着：
    “北大是自由的海洋，
    各处的水，不停息的汇集到这儿来”！
    是的，这里有一千多同学，有从大后方来的，有从平津一带及东北来的，有从老解放区来的，也有从新解放区来的。这些同学在一起生活，一起学习，真像兄弟姐妹一样！尤其是老解放区的同学和有着八年抗战历史从工作岗位上来的同学们，像老大哥一样，诚挚而亲切的，用各种方法来关心新同学，帮助新同学。一个从北平来的同学说：
    “若不谈起话来，根本一点儿也看不出谁是工作八年的老干部！可不像国民党区，一到北平就管学生叫伪学生。”
    学校对外边来的同学，特别关怀。因为他们冲过了国民党的封锁线，有不敢带行李的，有丢了衣服的，有没有钱的，学校尽量给想办法。给做被子他给提前发衣服，无论如何都要使他们精神愉快的来安心学习。
    我们学校的事务，完全由杂务人员来管理，这里值得我们特别提起的，便是我们的范校长夫人戴冠芳同志，他是被我们公认的“老母亲”。记得一天早晨刚上完早操，我和新从陕西汉中中学来的一位陈光同学，准备到门外麦地里去看书，刚一出门，便碰见她正在吆喝着往院子里赶猪。她看见我们便笑着说：“刚一开门，猪就跑出来了！”我们放下书，帮着她把猪赶进院子。她指着一个大猪对我们说：“再养些日子，我们就吃了他。”我们都笑了。他又继续对我们说：
    “现在吃的不好，慢慢的改善，将来生产多了，就好啦！”她虽然年岁很大了，走路又有些不伶俐，但她却从早到晚，老是不闲；帮着喂猪，帮着在厨房里做饭……记得李宗唐同学在壁报上写的“我有了妈妈”中说：他又回到了温暖的家，虽然生身的妈妈死去了！但他现在的妈妈却比原来的妈妈更爱他，更关怀他。
    走出了校门，陈光同学很感动的对我说：
    “要是国民党区里的大学校长太太，那有做这些事的！”他接着又说：
    “我们在汉中的学校里，谁管什么改善伙食！校长为了揩油省雇夫子钱，叫学生到离学校二十多里的城里去背米，你若有病不去背这一星期的米，就扣你这一星期的伙食，不叫你吃饭！同学们多半都是家庭没有接济，有的连剪头钱都没有！冬天没被子睡在厨房的灶炕旁边。吃不饱，穿不上衣裳，根本没人问！但是校长当了一年就揩油两千多万……”他的眼睛闪着愤慨的光，停一会儿，又缓和的笑着说：
    “现在咱学校的同学们真像一个大家庭的兄弟姐妹一样，我自从来到这里，精神不知为什么这样痛快！你看我一天比一天吃的多了。”他嘴角上露出了掩饰不住的微笑。眼睛望着远方——好像庆幸着他逃出了国民党统治区，投身在这自由温暖的大家庭里。
            民主作风，相互学习
    范校长说：“我们是革命的学校，一切都要以民主的作风，走群众路线的。”譬如我们生活方面：如何使生活严肃起来，如何克服一切不良现象。学习方面：怎样订课程，怎样规定学习时间，都要经过同学们的讨论，然后校方再综合同学意见来制定公约或课程表，再分别的按照这些规程去实行。
    我们的学习，以学习小组为单位，毫无拘束的去发表意见，去研讨。除了学校编定的小组外，同学们更分别按自己志趣，组织起来去研究。如哲学、文艺、外国语、数学等等小组。无论清晨或黄昏，一组集中在一起，或寝室里，或操场树荫下，或麦地里，展开热烈的讨论，无论意见如何不同，讨论一天或半天，终要认真的得出结论来。
    有一次我们开讨论会，讨论到什么是“真理”，有的同学说：“真理有相对的，也有绝对的。”有的同学说：“真理是随时代演变的，只要在那个时代大多数人认为是对，那就是真理。”还有的说：“不对，要是变就不能叫做真理，社会前进一步而是更接近真理一步，那个时代所认为是对的，并不能说它是真理。”三种不同的意见展开热烈的辩论，讨论了一上午，一直到打了吃饭钟，还是三个对立的意见。后来一个同学提议说：
    “我看咱们这矛盾虽统一了，最好把陈唯实教授请来……结果，有的去请陈教授，有的跑到厨房叫伙夫给留饭。一直等陈教授详细的解释后，同学们才放下紧张热烈的心情，轻松了一口气，好像做完了一件大事似的，微笑着散了会。
    我们的课外活动，有唱歌和演剧，……………除了这些文化娱乐外，便是出壁报。如“生活墙报”、“学习报”、“学习生活”、“北方吼声”、“绿洲”，——共十多种。有综合性的，有纯文艺的，这些大众园地充分发挥了毛主席所说的：“知无不言，言无不尽”，自由的向同学，向学校提意见。互相展开批评、检讨，这样自己学习，并帮助别人学习。所以这里的同学，无论政治水平与文化水平怎样，进步都非常快。
    范校长来校后第一次讲话便对我们说：“我们千万不要犯啃书本子的毛病，我们要实事求是，不骄不吝的去相互学习。不光是记住“全心全意为人民服务”的话，更重要的是贯彻到实际行动中去。譬如我范文澜要有不好的地方，你们可以在壁报上随便提意见，我一定要诚心的去接受改正。如果我要真不能全心全意为你们服务，那你们可以把我赶出去……………”那时同学们都感动的鼓起掌来。
            我们都是生产战士
    我们的校舍，是过去敌人的兵营，敌人走后房子大部被破坏了。为了早日重新建筑起来，同学们在课余时间都去那古老的顺德府城墙上挖砖，男女同学在城墙上用钻头把砖挖出来，又一块一块的从上边扔下来。底下的同学拾砖的拾砖，装车的装车，十来个人拉一辆车运到新校舍去。
    学校号召大生产——开荒。因为我们的新校舍有两顷多荒地。我们这次动员了全校的职员和学生一起去开荒，因为这是一笔很大的收入。
    星期一的早晨，生产委员领着男女同学带着犁和镐、锹，一支生产大军浩浩荡荡地向新校舍进发了！
    这一次生产，是我们来校后比较最大的一次，日子大约延续五六天。不但开荒，并要很快的下完种。
    一片长满了荒草的土地，我们必须先把土翻起来才行，还有敌人掘的防空沟，也必须填平。于是男同学拉犁，女同学填坑。一声长长的哨音，便这样动工了！
    有的拉犁的同学喊着“喂！保持九十度……”还有的同学一边拉犁，一边合着唱起来：“不怕那艰苦似海，不怕那困难如山，我们朝着太阳，永远向……前……”这声音带有一种不可战胜的力量，直波到很远的地方。
    第一组的周予同学，工作精神最好，同学都很佩服他，伸出大姆指头，叫他“劳动英雄”。
    工作是替换着休息的。休息时间有好多同学把乱砖堆起来，横上木杆，跳高。三十多岁的同学，也和十八九岁的同学在一起打闹，拿拉犁的绳子，来“飞绳竞走”！
    绿色的荒地，刹那间变成了褐色的新土——整个的大地，完全浸浴在愉快的气氛里！
                                                一九四六，六。
