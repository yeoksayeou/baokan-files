    Wu Heida was a new soldier who had just escaped from the stubborn army. The day before yesterday, he had a disagreement with the squad leader, felt uneasy, and pretended to be sick to desert at night. He was dissuaded by his comrades outside the village and felt very ashamed. After the squad leader explained it to him, he decided to go to his comrades during roll call that night to confess…
    However, that afternoon, Wu Heida really got a headache. The squad leader made his bed for him, helped him, and told him to lie down. The company commander then sent the squad leader to the street. Wu Heida gradually fainted and drifted into a dream due to excessive fatigue.
    Later, he heard the roll call "da da da" sound. He endured the pain and sat up to go to the front yard to admit his mistake to his comrades and explain things clearly. Suddenly, he saw the squad leader coming in to stop him.
    "Lie down," the squad leader said, "It's okay, you can talk later."
    "No!" Wu Heida refused, saying, "I must go!"
    He walked to the front of the team, and everyone looked at him, applauding enthusiastically…
    He began to narrate his past:
    "Comrades!" Wu Heida said with shame and remorse, "I will never leave again! ... Where can I find such a squad leader?" He lowered his head and continued, "I am a farmer from the countryside of Bin County. In the winter of 1941, Wang Baochang sent us to Zhenyuan County to deliver military grain. There, we were detained by the Central Army and became new recruits. For two and a half years, my face was covered with slap marks from those dog officials. But what makes me most sad is the death of my fellow villager, Chen the Tanner, which I witnessed with my own eyes. At that time, Chen the Tanner was sick, and the dog company commander Wang Jinrong saw him when he came to the class, rolled his eyes, and forced him to be carried out of the class. We were a little slow, and he started cursing: 'What are you doing? Still keeping him at home, hindering public health!?' How is that like our revolutionary ranks? When I made a mistake, I was still comforted. ... "
    So, with a sad heart, he came to cry about the story of Old Chen. Old Chen was thrown into a broken kiln outside the village. The kiln had no doors or windows, and there was a disgusting urine smell inside -- this was where the village pigs and dogs and passers-by often urinated and defecated. The grass at the base of the wall had grown more than a foot high, and moss had grown in the damp places at the corners of the kiln…
    "It was getting dark, and I secretly went to see him. Chen the Tanner was sleeping on a door panel. When he saw me, he burst into tears and grabbed me, not allowing me to leave. He said:
    "Old Wu, I'm finished, save me…"
    "Oh God, what can I do? I comforted him: 'I haven't forgotten you, I will come to see you often!' But he still refused to let me go. He kept cursing Wang Baochang in his mouth!
    "The next day, I didn't dare to see him during the day, because Wang Jinrong announced: the patient should be isolated, and only the medical officer is allowed to check."
    "It was getting dark," I really wanted to see if he was better, so I pretended to go to the toilet and bought a few eggs from the villagers with the money I had on me to bring to him. I really believed that there was a medical officer taking care of him there, and I wanted to take it to ask the medical officer to cook it for him.
    "However, when I arrived at the broken kiln, there wasn't a single ghost, only Old Chen wrapped in a tattered overcoat -- this was not his original overcoat, his good one had already been taken away by the company commander's people -- he fell from the door panel to the ground, moaning slightly, already close to death. Only then did I understand that Wang Jinrong's 'medical officer inspection,' not allowing people to take care of him, was originally to make him die sooner, so that he could eat an empty quota. I squatted down and helped him back onto the door panel. He used a trembling weak voice, shouting cold, but his nostrils burned with blood, smearing his face with blood clots. He opened his fiery red eyes, staring at me, for a long time. He seemed to wake up and said:
    "Brother, I remember you…
    "I couldn't give him the eggs to eat. I ran to the villager's house again, wanting to cook it well and then send it to him. He was afraid of leaving me, and grabbed me tightly:
    "Don't go, think of our relationship as fellow villagers, you're the only one who remembers me! Brother…" he said, his eyes flashing pitifully. "When I die, send a message to my family…"
    "But for days, no one sent him water or food, and he really hoped that I would get some water for him to drink….
    "There, the villagers hated us very much, and they made up a song for us:
    The black-skinned watermelon has no good intentions,
     The Vanguard Corps harms the common people,
     Stealing chickens and radishes in broad daylight,
     Grabbing recruits from every family at night,
     The Vanguard Corps! The Vanguard Corps!
     See when you die a short death?
    Therefore, when I went to the villager's house, they were unwilling to lend me a pot to use. After saying a lot of good things, he seemed to pity me, and then 'hmm'ed and nodded, indicating that it was okay. I had just started the fire when the team blew the roll call. There was no way, I couldn't go to see him again. I begged the villagers to have mercy and send it to him for me…
    "On the third day, it was almost midnight, and I went off duty and secretly went to see him again. At that time, it was about to rain heavily, and there wasn't a single star in the sky. A group of hungry wolves were fighting on the river beach, howling chaotically. I was also a little scared myself. I slowly groped my way to the broken kiln and called him softly -- it was impossible to call him loudly, if the platoon leader heard, he would kill me, or have my legs gouged out and be expelled!
    'Old Chen, Old Chen…'
    "No one answered. I then used my hand to feel around. I was afraid that he had rolled onto the ground and fallen asleep. But I couldn't feel anything, and my hair stood on end. I thought: 'He must have been dragged away by wolves!'
    "I wanted to run…
    "But, remembering that he was my fellow villager, I slowly used my foot to stir him in the broken kiln. I thought: 'Even if he is dead, I have to know his whereabouts, so that when I return to the village, I can tell his family clearly.' Finally, I really stirred him up. He was naked, shivering with cold, lying stiffly in the corner of the kiln. I was so scared that I shivered and turned to run…
    "The next day, the brothers in the company went to see him and carried him under a large maple tree. Company Commander Wang Jinrong's wife covered her nose and glanced at him from the courtyard above, scolding:
    "'The man doesn't even wear pants, lying on the road, so disgusting, why don't you quickly carry him away and throw him away?'
    "Before long, Company Commander Wang Jinrong also came. He covered his nose and mouth with a towel and smiled evilly in the dark:
    "'What, the military doctor didn't come yesterday? Alas, I really didn't expect him to die…' You see, even the weasel is crying for the chicken."
    As Wu Heida spoke, tears rolled down his face, almost creating trenches on his cheeks. He wanted to continue speaking; but, suddenly he felt that he was standing under that big maple tree again. Chen the Tanner was lying there naked, his face covered with bloodstains, he looked at him, jumped up with an "Oh--" sound, grabbed him, and shouted sharply:
    "Brother, save me…"
    Wu Heida yelled strangely, woke up with a start, his face was covered with sweat, his heart was pounding straight, and he only felt that someone was supporting him behind him. He quickly used a towel to wipe his sweat. Who is this? He turned his head strangely, looked at it for a long time, and then recognized it. …
    "Ah, Squad Leader! ..." he shouted, tears streaming out. "You…?"
    "What's wrong?"
    "You… have you really forgiven me?"
    "Why wouldn't I forgive you? Don't think like that anymore," the squad leader wiped his sweat for him again! "Do you want to drink water?"
    "Yes."
    The squad leader gently placed him on the pillow, went to the front yard to bring water, mixed in some white sugar, and handed it to him.
    "Try it and see if it's sweet," the squad leader said, "The company commander asked me to buy it for you just now."
    Wu Heida took the bowl, looked at the squad leader, and slowly lowered his head…
                                     July 13, 1945, Dongshan

　　恶梦
    思基
    吴黑大是刚从顽固军里逃来的新战士，前天，因为和班长闹了意见，心里不舒展，夜里就装病开小差，被同志们在村外劝阻回来，自己觉得非常惭愧。经过班长给他解释以后，他决定在晚上点名的时候，去向同志们悔过……
    但是，当天下午，吴黑大真头痛起来，班长给他铺好了被子，扶着他，叫他睡下，连长就叫班长上街去了。吴黑大由于过度疲乏，渐渐晕迷而梦过去了。
    后来他听得点名号“哒哒哒”的响了，他忍着痛，坐起来要到前院去向同志们认错，说明白。突然见班长进来了，要阻止住他。
    “躺着吧，”班长说：“好啦以后再去讲。”
    “不！”吴黑大拒绝说：“咱一定要去！”
    他走到队前去了，大家看着他，热烈的鼓着掌……
    他开始叙述他的过去：
    “同志们！”吴黑大惭愧和懊悔的说：“咱是再也不走啦！……我往那里去找这样的班长呢？”他低下了头继续说：“我是彬县乡下的庄稼人，四一年冬天，王保长派我们到镇原县去送军粮，在那里被中央军扣住当了新兵。半三年的时光，我脸上被那些狗官们打遍了巴掌印。但我最伤心的就是我老乡陈二皮匠的死，那是我亲眼看见的。当时，陈二皮匠病啦，狗连长王金融到班里来看见，翻起了眼睛，硬逼着要叫抬出班去，我们稍慢了一步，就骂开了：‘你们干什么？还放在家里妨碍公共卫生！？’那里像咱们革命队伍呢？我做了错事还安慰我。……”
    于是，他带着悲痛的心，来哭诉着老陈的故事。老陈被扔到村外边的一孔破窑里。那窑洞没有门窗，里面一股恶心的尿嗅味--这是村里的猪狗和过路人常常大小便的地方。墙根的草，已经长起来有一尺多高，窑角里阴湿的地方，长起了青苔……
    “天黑啦，咱偷偷的去看他，陈二皮匠睡在块门板上，见了我，他就嚎啕大哭，抓住我，不准我走。他说：
    “老吴，咱快完啦，你救救我……”
    “天呀，我有什么办法呢？我劝慰他：‘咱没忘记你，我会常常来看你的！’但他仍不肯放我。嘴里连声的骂着王保长！
    “第二天，白天我不敢去看他，因为王金融宣布啦：病号要隔离，只准医官去检查。”
    “天快黑了，”我实在想看看他好了点没有，便装着去大便，把自个身上的几个钱，在老百姓家里买了几个鸡蛋给他带去，我真相信那里有医官照护他，我想拿去请医官煮给他吃。
    “但是，我到了破窑里，鬼也没有一个，只见老陈裹着一件破大衣--这不是他原来的大衣，他那好的已经被连长派人来换走了--从门板上掉到地下了，微微的呻吟着，已经快要死了。我这才明白，王金融的‘医官检查’，不准人管，原是要叫他早些死掉，他好多吃一个空额。我蹲下去，把他又扶到门板上来。他用着颤动的微弱声音，喊着冷，鼻孔里却烧出了血，糊得满脸都是血块。他睁着火红的眼睛，死盯住我，老半天。他才醒悟似的说：
    “兄弟，我记得你……
    “鸡蛋拿给他不能吃。我又跑到老乡家里去，想煮好了，再给他送去。他害怕离开我，死死抓住我：
    “不要走，看着同乡的关系吧，就剩你一个人记得我啦！兄弟……”他说着，眼睛可怜的闪动着。“咱死啦，给咱家里捎个信……”
    “但几天来没人给他送点水和饭，他也实在希望我去弄点水来给他喝……。
    “在那里，老乡都很恨我们，他们给我们编了个歌子：
    黑皮的西瓜没好心，
     挺进师害死老百姓，
     大白天捉鸡偷萝卜，
     黑夜里遍家抓壮丁，
     挺进师！挺进师！
     看你那天才短命？
    因此，我去老乡家，他们不肯借锅给我用，说了半天好话，他似乎也可怜我了，才‘嗯’了一声，点点头，表示可以。我刚烧着火，队伍就吹点名号了。没有办法，我再不能去看他了。我请老百姓可怜可怜，替我给他送去……
    “第三天，快半夜啦，我下了岗，又偷偷去看他。那时，天正要下大雨了，外面连一点星光也没有，很远的地方响起了雷声。河滩上一群饿狼在打架，噢噢噢的乱嚎。我自个儿也有些害怕了。我慢慢摸到破窑里，轻声的喊叫他--大声的叫是不可能的，连排长听见，就会杀死我，或两腿剜烂，开革的！
    ‘老陈，老陈……’
    “没有人答应。我便用手去摸。我怕他又滚到地上睡着了哩。可是，什么也摸不到，我汗毛都立起了。我想：‘一定被狼拖走了！’
    “我想跑……
    “可是，又想起他是我老乡，我慢慢用脚在破窑里拌他。我想：‘就是他死啦也得知道他的下落，将来回到村上去，好告诉他家里人个明白。’最后，我真拌着了。他光着个身子，冷得直挺挺的，横在窑角里。我吓得打着寒噤，转身就跑……
    “第二天，连上的兄弟们去看他，把他抬到一棵大枫树底下。连长王金融的太太，掩着鼻子，站在上面院子里看了一眼，骂着说：
    “‘男人连裤子也不穿，放在大路上，多恶心，还不快抬去丢掉？’
    “不多会，连长王金融也来了，他用手巾掩着鼻子同嘴，狰恶的暗暗笑了笑：
    “‘怎么，昨天军医没有来？唉，真没想到他会死……’你们看，黄鼠狼也哭起鸡来了。”
    吴黑大讲着：眼泪滚滚的往脸上流，脸蛋上都快起壕沟了。他想还要讲；但，忽然觉得他又站在那棵大枫树底下。陈二皮匠在那里赤条条的躺着，脸上满是血痕，他看着他，“噢--”的一声跳起来，手来抓他，尖声的叫着：
    “兄弟，救救我……”
    吴黑大怪叫一声，惊醒过来他脸上淌着大汗，心噗噗噗的直跳，只觉的有一个人在他背后扶着他。忙着用毛巾给他擦汗。这是谁呢？他奇怪的转过头去，打量了半天，才认出来。……
    “呵，班长！……”他叫着，眼泪滚了出来“你……？”
    “怎么？”
    “你……真原谅了我么？”
    “怎么不原谅你呢？可别再这么想吧”，班长又给他擦着汗！“你要喝水么？”
    “喝。”
    班长把他轻轻放在枕头上，到前院去端着水来，拌了些白糖，递给他。
    “试试甜不甜，”班长说：“刚才连长叫去给你买来的。”
    吴黑大接过碗，看了看班长，慢慢的低下了头……
                                     一九四五、七、一三日东山
