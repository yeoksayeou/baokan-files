　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 26th:  Soldiers Herlden, et al., seven in number, from the First Platoon, First Company, Seventh Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed at the Liushouying on the Beining Railway, at 6:00 PM on the 13th of this month, carrying six automatic rifles and traveling in two vehicles, invaded Xihe and Nancun in the Fourth District of Changli in the Ji'dong Liberated Area (ten li southeast of Liushouying), and opened fire on the local militia. The local militia disarmed them. Afterwards, a large contingent of U.S. soldiers and Chiang's troops from Liushouying came in force to provoke the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Area. In order to avoid escalating the situation, the latter painfully withdrew and sent the seven U.S. soldiers to the 13th Military Sub-district of the Ji'dong Military Region for processing. After the U.S. soldiers were disarmed, the Military Sub-district Command made proper arrangements for them. They stated that a large number of U.S. soldiers now want to be demobilized and return home, and that continuing to stay in China to help the authorities fight the civil war is not their intention. They also expressed that they understand that the Eighth Route Army has no hostility towards them, and that their disarmament was due to their own fault. The Ji'dong Military Region Command, considering that U.S. troops along the Beining Railway have been constantly harassing the Ji'dong Liberated Area recently, and that the incident of the seven U.S. soldiers is only one of them, which is clearly an interference in China's internal affairs, an infringement of China's sovereignty, and a disruption of the peaceful order of the Liberated Area, and in fact covers up and assists the Kuomintang army's military offensive against the Liberated Area, sent an urgent telegram on the 17th of this month to General Nie Rongzhen of Jin-Cha-Ji, lodging a serious protest with the U.S. representative of the Executive Headquarters. It also demanded that the U.S. side formally apologize to the Liberated Area authorities and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, otherwise the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Area will resolutely defend themselves, and all consequences will be borne by the U.S. side. On the 15th, a special team from the Executive Headquarters came to Changli to investigate the truth. On the 20th, they met with Commander Li of the Military Sub-district at a place fifty li south of Changli city. The U.S. representative admitted that the U.S. military's intrusion into the Liberated Area was indeed a mistake, and immediately reported to his superiors, ordering the U.S. military not to arbitrarily harass the Liberated Area in the future. The names and numbers of the seven U.S. soldiers are as follows: (1) Merlden, 20 years old, number 828863, from Weineda, enlisted at the age of 17; (2) Rhett, 18 years old, 579771, from Washington, enlisted at the age of 16; (3) Schposh, 27 years old, 55746, from Pennsylvania, enlisted at the age of 17; (4) Banks, 18 years old, 57465, from Indiana, enlisted at the age of 17; (5) Hick, 20 years old, 95841, from Haichong, enlisted at the age of 18; (6) Marutko, 18 years old, 570754, from Eluivi, enlisted at the age of 18; (7) Saluven, 19 years old, 552764, from Elumangsi, enlisted at the age of 17.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 26th: According to a Central News Agency report on the 25th: U.S. Marine Corps Commander Rockey officially announced yesterday that the seven U.S. soldiers who went missing near Beidaihe (referring to harassing the Liberated Area and being disarmed by the local militia) have been released and safely returned to Tianjin on the evening of the 24th.
