　　General Zhou Baozhong
    Liu Baiyu
    The first time I saw General Zhou Baozhong was one night in the former "Kwantung Army Headquarters," a massive, deep-gray building in Changchun. He was on a swivel chair at his desk in a not-so-large office, talking on the phone. He had just put down the receiver on his left and quickly turned around, looking at me with those cheerful, smiling eyes and said a few words before the phone on his right rang again. I observed him from the side. He had a long, round face and a generous mouth, which made him appear alert and steady. He also had a solid and energetic body. He wore a yellow military uniform with his trousers tucked into tall black leather boots. The deep-gray office felt tense and serious. At that moment, a thought flashed through my mind – what is he thinking now? Is he happy? Fourteen years in the frozen wilderness, and now he is sitting in the former headquarters of his enemies... Of course, this was out of my curiosity, a feeling of elation, but what about him? In this new phase of the Northeast liberation struggle, he is living as tirelessly as before, in constant labor.
    His old subordinate, Zhang Jiangqi, a lively young man who had been Zhou's machine gunner, once told me, "He has too much to do, but he always manages to find more to do. Back when we were hiding in the woods, the commander would still teach us a few characters every day."
    As early as 1932, he came to Northeast China from Shanghai to work and was assigned to conduct secret activities in the enemy-occupied areas. His original name was Xi Shaohuang, and he was from Dali County, Yunnan Province. His father was a shoemaker, and his mother was a peasant woman. He began his military life during the anti-Yuan uprising in Yunnan, and later studied engineering at the Yunnan Military Academy. In 1925, he served as a district leader at the Whampoa Military Academy. During the Northern Expedition, he served as chief of staff of a regiment in Cheng Qian and Lin Zuhan's Sixth Army. After the Great Revolution, he did secret work in Shanghai. But since then, he went deep into Northeast China and combined with the masses, starting from the most difficult conditions. In particular, he founded the strongest anti-Japanese United Army's Fifth Army. Later, in 1937, the entire Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army was organized into three routes, and he was the commander-in-chief of the Second Route Army, inflicting great blows and casualties on the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese hated him very much and were also very afraid of him. They offered a reward, saying, "You can exchange Zhou Baozhong's flesh for gold, one pound for one pound." Pictures were plastered everywhere, depicting him gnawing on horse bones under a big tree.
    General Zhou Baozhong spoke about the situation in 1938 when they were struggling under extremely difficult circumstances:
    "In December of winter, we returned to Yilan and Boli from the southwest to live, and at this time the weather was extremely cold, with no food, no bullets, and not even a single machine gun. Only about a hundred bullets were left, and when there were none, we would bury the guns. In winter, everyone was still wearing single layers of clothing, and soldiers standing guard would wrap themselves in sacks, but they still managed to complete their one-hour shift. At night, we would go to the fields to dig up potatoes, which the people had deliberately scattered and buried there to supply the Anti-Japanese United Army. Without tools, we used wooden sticks and our hands, digging until everyone's hands were bloody. Under these circumstances, with no food or bullets, we would be completely defeated if we encountered the enemy. At the end of December, I decided to pass through the boundless and endless Laoye Ridge mountain range. This ridge is two hundred li long from east to west, with snow three or four feet deep, covered with forests. People would fall down and couldn't get up...
    "At that time, we either had to fight to the death to survive or be completely defeated. At this critical moment, in order to eat, we had to go to the bandit-infested Songshulin to the east. Because I knew there were many lumber factories there, with tens of thousands of workers cutting wood and tens of thousands of horses.
    "However, there were more than two hundred Japanese devils guarding the only way through Laoye Ridge, and they were all very good at shooting. We had to take a detour. Some had cotton clothes, but some only had single layers of clothing and were terribly cold. From Sidao Hezi to the top of the mountain, strong winds broke large trees ten or more zhang tall, and many people were killed. We couldn't light fires, we couldn't pitch tents, and forty or fifty people froze to death in that stretch. The horses we were carrying were either killed or frozen and eaten. We climbed to the top of the mountain in four days, and then walked slowly, scouting for three days, only hearing the chirping of small birds day and night. We couldn't even see wild animals. Entering the forest was like entering the sea. On the third day, we suddenly heard the sound of cutting wood in the distance, and then the scouting team quietly went forward – we only needed to capture one person to get a clue.
    "Several hours later, they returned, proving that these were bandits. The workers in the lumber camp were extremely enthusiastic when they saw us, shaking our hands tightly, telling us the truth about the lumber camp, and willing to help us. There were five hundred puppet police and two hundred Japanese soldiers in the lumber camp. I thought to myself, we only have a dozen bullets each, and the enemy has fortifications to defend – what certainty do we have of winning by force? But since we had already arrived, we had no choice but to fight.
    "At night, we attacked the lumber camp in three routes, and it took us four hours to walk five li. There was no road, and one person followed the footsteps of another. At midnight, we saw fires and heard the sound of horses. We launched a fierce attack as soon as we arrived, and in the end, we fought the Japanese soldiers with bayonets, killing more than a hundred. At dawn, the workers helped us harness the horses, pulled out white flour from the warehouse, four sacks per horse, and pulled out twenty horses, then retreated back up the mountain along the old road. We replenished ten thousand bullets. We fought several battles with the pursuing enemy on the mountain's narrow paths, and then retreated back to the west side of the ridge.
    "After arriving at the west side of the ridge, I took out a portion of the food and hid the hundreds of frozen people in the forest. I took eight hundred people and crossed the Wudao River to the territory of Boli County. After one or two months of battle, we were left with just over a hundred people and were squeezed by the enemy into Jiapigou, which was a series of large mountains between two large rivers, full of intricate gullies. Enemy planes flew as low as the treetops, circling and searching. Once, we arrived at a place called Xiaodifang, built houses with wood, covered them with snow, sawed wood and burned fires inside, not revealing a single movement, and stayed for ten days. After another battle, we continued our march, and we went higher and higher, all the way up to large stone rocks, stone caves, strange rock piles, and stone walls like knife points. All day long, there were only howling winds. Occasionally we heard the sound of planes, but we couldn't see their shadows. Later, on the map, I learned that this was the extreme peak of the Wanda Mountains. When the food was gone, our artilleryman, Comrade Bi Zhouxin, shot two black bears, one weighing seven hundred jin and the other five hundred jin. After everyone had eaten, we moved to a place called Tanzifang and hid in the cellar again, seventy or eighty people squeezed together, thinking we might as well die together. The enemy's regiments were only three li away. One day, we were standing guard on top of a tree, and several enemies searched past the house two hundred steps away and past the sentry twenty steps away. I judged that they had not discovered us and decided not to move. We hid for thirty-eight days. I thought that the enemy's grain supply was limited and that they should be running out soon. On the forty-second day, I sent someone to the top to see, and there was still smoke over there. I said we must leave tomorrow. The next day we went to the top of the rock again, and they still hadn't left, everyone panicked. I said: We must leave tomorrow, because there used to be gunfire all day long, but now there is none. We heard the sound of sawing and talking, but no other sounds. We went out to take a look, and they had indeed left. That's how we survived the winter. When spring came, our time to be active came again."
    In countless similar difficulties, General Zhou Baozhong used his unparalleled determination and wisdom to forge a path to survival. Every time he marched, when he was hungry, he would eat some fried soybeans or chew on snow to get through the day. He was wounded in five places on his body, except for two times which were scars left from the Great Revolution, the other three times were glorious wounds from the fourteen years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. During those fourteen years, the people of Northeast China were in a dark place, and only the Anti-Japanese United Army led by the Communist Party stood with the people, becoming a beacon of hope for them. The name of General Zhou Baozhong represents that beacon. In the most difficult times for the Anti-Japanese United Army, when his comrades Yang Jingyu and Zhao Shangzhi were sacrificing one after another, he supported the overall situation alone and overcame all insurmountable hardships and crises. After "August 15th," he mobilized an army of 150,000 people in the Jihei area and continued to fight for the complete liberation of the people of Northeast China. He is now the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic United Army. No wonder that when he led the Democratic United Army into the Dongrong District of Changchun this time, every street opened its doors to welcome them! The image often appears in my mind: he stands with millions of Northeast masses, advancing joyfully in the midst of a great storm!

　　周保中将军
    刘白羽
    我第一次看到周保中将军，是一个夜晚，在长春原“关东军司令部”那深灰色的巨厦里，他正在他一间不怎样宽大的办公室的案前一只转椅上打电话。他刚把左边的电话听筒放下，很快的转过身子，用那愉快微笑的眼睛望着我谈了两句话，他右边的电话铃又响了。我从侧面观察他，他有一张长圆面孔，宽厚的嘴，显得机警而又殷稳。他还有坚实而精力丰沛的身体，他穿的黄色军服，把裤腿塞在黑的长筒皮靴里。深灰色的办公室中显得紧张、严肃。当时曾经有这样一种想法掠过脑筋——他现在怎样想呢？他会愉快吧！十四年冰天雪地，现在他坐在他的敌人以前的司令部里面……自然，这是我的一种好奇，一种快感，而他呢？他在东北解放斗争的新阶段里，一如从前一样，他在不懈的劳碌中生活。
    他的老部下张江旗是一个活泼的青年，他作过周的机枪射手。一次跟我说：“他事情太多了，可是他总要找着作很多事情。我在从前钻树林子的时候，司令员一天还教我们认几个字”。
    远在一九三二年，他从上海来东北工作，被派到敌占区秘密活动。他原名奚绍黄，是云南大理县人，父亲是鞋匠，母亲是农妇。他从云南讨袁起义开始他的军人生活，后来在云南讲武堂学过工兵。一九二五年，在黄埔军校担任过区队长，北伐时在程潜及林祖涵同志的第六军任过团的参谋长。大革命后，在上海作秘密工作。可是，从那以后——他深入东北与群众结合，从最艰苦情况下作起，特别是他手创了最坚强的抗日联军第五军。后来在三七年，全东北抗日联军编为三路，他是第二路军的总指挥，给了日人很大的打击和杀伤，因此日人非常仇恨他，也非常怕他。他们悬赏说：“拿周保中的肉可以换金子，一斤换一斤。”到处贴满图画，画他在大树底下啃马骨头。
    周保中将军讲了三八年他们在极端困难之下，如何斗争的情形：
    “冬天十二月，我们从西南方回到伊兰、勃利寄居起来，这时天气极冷，没有粮食子弹，也没有一挺机枪，剩下百来粒子弹，有的没有了就把枪埋藏起来。冬天大家还穿着单衣，战士站岗用麻袋围在身上，一个个还是把一点钟站完下来。夜晚就到土地里去发掘土豆，那是老百姓故意分散埋藏在那里，供给抗日联军的。没有工具，用木棍，用手，掘得大家老是双手鲜血淋淋。在这种无粮无弹情况下，一遭遇敌人，就会全部瓦解。到了十二月底，我决心通过莽然无际的老爷岭山岭。这岭，东西二百里长，积雪三四尺深，遍布森林，人倒下去就爬不起来……。
    “我们当时或者拼死命以求生存，或者全部瓦解。在这关头上，为了吃饭，必需往东面流寇松树林里去。因为我知道，那里有很多木厂，有上万工人砍伐木头，有上万匹马。
    “可是，老爷岭里有二百多日本鬼子守住必经之路，他们都是很能打枪的，我们得绕路。有的有棉衣，有的是单衣，冻得很厉害，从四道河子快到山顶，大风把十来丈高的大树纷纷折断，许多人被打死。火堆不能打，帐棚不能支，这一阵就冻死四五十人，携带的马匹，连杀带冻吃完了。四天爬到山峰上来，再走三天，慢慢侦查着走，白天夜晚只听见一点点小鸟叫声，连野兽都看不见，进了森林就如同进了海一样。第三天突然听见远远砍木头的声音，这时侦查队轻轻前去——只要捉到一个人就有头绪了。
    “几个钟头后回来了，证明这就是流寇。松木棚工人见我们来了，热情极高，紧紧拉着手，把木棚里实情告给我们，愿意帮助我们，木棚里有五百伪警察，二百日本兵。我想了想，我们一人十几粒子弹，敌人筑有工事据守——硬打有什么把握呢？可是已经到了，结果不打也不行。
    “夜间分三路去袭击木棚，五里地就走了四个钟头。没有路，一个人跟着一个人脚印走。半夜望见烧火，听见马叫声。我们一下来就猛烈袭击，最后和日本兵拼刺刀，打死一百多。天亮了，工人帮忙把马套上，从仓库里拉出白面，一匹马四口袋，拉了二十匹，就沿着旧路撤上山来。我们补充了十万子弹。在山林羊肠鸟道上，跟来追击的敌人打了几次仗，然后撤回岭西。
    “到岭西后，我抽出一部分粮食，把冻坏的几百人隐藏在森林里，自己带了八百人，冲过五道河，到勃利县境，经过一两个月的战斗，我们剩下一百多人，被敌人挤进夹皮沟，那是两条大河之间的层层大山，到处是错综复杂的沟，敌人飞机十几架飞得跟树顶一样低；盘旋搜索。一次，我们到了一个叫小地房地方，用木头砌成房子，用雪盖起，在屋里锯木烧火，一点动静不露，住了十天。又打了一仗后，继续行军，我们愈走愈高，上去全是大石岩、石洞、怪石堆、刀尖一样的石壁，整天就是狂风呼呼，偶然听见飞机声，也看不到影子。后来在地图上，才知道这是完达山岭极峰。粮食完了，我们一个炮手毕洲信同志打了两只黑瞎子（熊），一只七百斤，一只五百斤，大家吃完了，又转到一处叫炭子房，又躲在地窖里，七八十人挤在一起，想死死在一起吧，敌人联队相距三里远。一天，我们在树顶上站岗，几个敌人搜着离房二百步、离哨兵二十步过去了，我判断他没有发现，决定不动。藏到三十八天，我想敌人带粮是有一定量的，想来应该快吃完了。到四十二天上，我派人去顶上看看，那边还在冒烟，我说明天一定走。次日又到岩顶，还未走，大家慌了，我说：明天一定走，因为原来整天枪声，现在没有了，拉锯说话，什么声音都没有了，出去一看，果然走了，我们就是这样熬过冬天。春天来了，我们活跃的时候又来了”。
    在同样无数次困难之中，周保中将军都以他无比的坚决与智慧打出一条生路，他每次行军，饥饿时，吃点炒黄豆、嚼雪过日子。他身上五处负伤，除了二次是大革命时留下的痕迹外，三次都是这十四年抗日战争的光荣创伤。十四年间，东北人民处于黑暗之地，只有共产党所领导的抗日联军与人民在一起，成为他们希望的光亮，周保中将军的名字，就代表着这光亮。在抗日联军最困难的时候——他的战友杨靖宇、赵尚志一个个牺牲了，一身支撑了全局，一切不能克服的困苦危机克服了。“八一五”后，他在吉黑一带发动了十五万人民大军，继续为东北人民彻底解放而奋斗。他现在是民主联军副总司令，无怪乎这次他率领民主联军进入长春东荣区的时候，走到那一条街，那一条街都开开门欢迎他们！我脑子里常常出现这样的影子：他与千百万东北群众站在一起，在巨风暴雨中狂欢前进！
