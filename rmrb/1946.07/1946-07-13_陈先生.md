Mr. Chen

　　When the municipal government called on teachers to participate in the mass movement, Mr. Chen frowned deeply, ... ...
　　Because one day he saw the masses fighting a local tyrant in a vacant lot, their angry fists swinging like iron hammers, determined to strike down the unreasonable, man-eating, blood-drinking scoundrel. ... ... Mr. Chen dared not look directly, shaking his head and walking into the school gate with his hands clasped behind his back, as if he could still hear the crowd roaring.
　　His colleagues saw the gloomy look on his face and asked him, "What big thing has happened?" He didn't answer, sat down at his desk, took a sip of tea, sighed deeply, and picked up his pen to write a poem on the white paper:
        Seeing the anti-tyrant,
        It really makes one afraid,
        Fists like stones,
        Want to hit my body.

　　Today, his colleagues all went to participate in the struggle against the big traitor and local tyrant, Will Cong (the head traitor of Jiaozuo). Mr. Chen also dragged his legs along, although he didn't really want to go, but he had already voiced his intention, afraid that his colleagues would laugh at him for being "backward."
　　When he arrived at the venue, Mr. Chen hid in the back of the crowd, wondering "what to do" if a real fight broke out. The reasoning and struggle began, and surprisingly, the masses didn't hit anyone. One after another, they poured out their "bitter water." Mr. Chen didn't know what was happening. Curiosity prompted him to slowly squeeze to the front of the crowd to listen to the "bitter water." The more he listened, the more bitter it became. The suffering people cried like they were attending a funeral. When an old woman with white hair, the mother of a worker, recounted that her family of nine had starved to death three members because the traitor had embezzled their wages, and five had fled to escape famine, still unknown whether wolves had dragged away their corpses or if they were still alive, Mr. Chen was also moved. He nodded and said to himself, "The tyrant really deserves to be killed!"
　　After the meeting, he returned to the school with a very stern expression. His colleagues saw him pick up his pen again to write his feelings:
        Hearing the pouring of bitter water,
        It really hurts people's hearts.
        The tyrant is like a tiger and wolf,
        Causing people to die.
        Beating him to vent anger,
        Is truly justifiable.

　　Mr. Chen's village was also fighting against local tyrants. Although Mr. Chen still had a donkey and his middle peasant life was still passable, he had also suffered a lot from the local tyrants.
　　One day in his village, he heard someone pouring out their grievances. He couldn't hold back his emotions, rolled up the sleeves of his long robe, and, like preaching in a church, began to pour out his own grievances. After the meeting, everyone saw that he was very articulate and elected him as a member of the liquidation committee.
　　After two days of liquidation, distribution, and struggle that bore fruit, everyone decided to give him a "branch differential" compensation fee of one dou of wheat. Everyone also said, "Mr. Chen contributed a lot to this struggle!"
　　That day, he walked back to school, no longer frowning. His colleagues saw that he looked like he had good news and asked him. He laughed heartily and recited aloud:
        Participating in the anti-tyrant,
        Once engaged, I'm not afraid,
        There is only one truth,
        What am I still afraid of today?

　　陈先生

            （一）
    市政府号召教员参加群运的时候，陈先生紧锁着两道眉毛，……………。
    因为他有一天在一个空场子上见到群众正轰轰烈烈在那里斗争恶霸，一颗颗气愤的拳头像铁锤般挥动，他们要把不讲理的吃人肉喝人血的坏蛋打倒。………………陈先生不敢正眼看一下，摇一摇头双手剪着背走进学校门里，似乎还能听到人群呼吼。
    同事们见到他脸上神色黯淡，就问他：“发生了什么大事情呀？”他不作回答，坐下办公桌边端起茶碗喝了一口茶，长长叹了一口气，拿起笔来在白纸一写起一首诗：
        看到反恶霸，
        叫人实在怕，
        拳头如石块，
        想往身上打。
            （二）
    今天同事们都去参加斗争大汉奸恶霸威尔功，（焦作的汉奸头子）陈先生也拖上两条腿跟着去了，当然也想不去，但自己把话头已说出口，怕同事们笑话“落后”。
    到了会场，陈先生躲闪在人群后面，心中想着真打起来“该怎办”？说理斗争开始了，真出乎意料之外，群众并没有打，一个跟一个倒起“苦水”来，陈先生不知怎么会事，好奇心促着他，慢慢挤到人群前面去听“苦水”，越听越苦，受苦的人像送丧似痛哭着，当一位工人的母亲白发披头的老太太诉出一家九口人，因为汉奸私吞工资给饿死了三口，五口出去逃荒，到今天还不知狼拖吃了死尸，还是活着，陈先生也受了感动他点一点头心中说：“恶霸真该杀呀！”
    开完会，他回到学校里露出一幅很严正的脸色，同事见他又拿起笔写感想：
        听到吐苦水，
        实在人心伤。
        恶霸如虎狼，
        弄得人死亡。
        打他来出气，
        真是理应当。
            （三）
    陈先生家住的村子里，也在反恶霸，陈先生虽然还有一头驴，中农生活还过得去，但他也受过很多恶霸的气。
    这一天他在本村又听到一个人诉苦，诉到痛处他也压不住，卷起长袍袖子像在教堂上讲书一样诉起苦来，开完会大家看他很能说理，选了他当清算委员会委员。
    经过两天清算分配斗争果实时，大家决定，给他一斗麦子的支差赔偿费，大家还说：“陈先生这次参加斗争出了很大力！”
    这一天他走回学校，不再紧锁眉头，同事们看见他像有了喜事，就问他，他哈哈的笑着高诵：
        参加反恶霸，
        一干就不怕，
        真理祗一个，
        今天还怕啥。
                                      一九四六、六、十日于焦作、
