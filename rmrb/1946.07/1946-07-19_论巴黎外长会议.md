　　On the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference
    Weide
    (1) Achievements
    The second Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, responsible for drafting the peace treaty drafts for Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, has concluded after twenty-eight days, and has achieved significant results.
    Among these achievements, the most important is reaching an agreement on the fundamental issues of the five peace treaty drafts. Before achieving this agreement, the Foreign Ministers Conference resolved a series of related issues, such as the issue of Trieste. The conference adopted a compromise solution, which was neither the initial proposal by the Soviet representative to assign it to Yugoslavia, nor the original plan insisted upon by the American representative to assign it to Italy, but a compromise solution that stipulated the city as an internationally administered autonomous region. Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, the conference bypassed this reef that could have stalled the drafting of the treaty, and decided to resolve it in the coming year. Regarding the issue of Italian reparations, with the support of the French and British representatives, the conference adopted a decision that was largely the same as the original Soviet proposal. Regarding the issue of the Danube River, the conference adopted the British proposal as amended by the French representative. Following these agreements, the path for drafting the five peace treaties was finally paved.
    What are the reasons for the significant achievements of this conference?
    (2) Background
    First, from the American perspective, the American people desire lasting peace, and many American capitalists hope for post-war security in order to have opportunities to develop trade. For the world to be stable, US-Soviet compromise is essential. Therefore, today's American authorities, led by Truman, while constantly engaging in serious struggles against the Soviet Union (as manifested in the debates at various international conferences), and actively strengthening their military to overwhelm any other country (as manifested in atomic bomb tests, base plans, etc.), and while their policies are sometimes influenced by the most reactionary factions (such as Vandenberg, etc.), their basic policy remains to reach a conditional compromise with the Soviet Union. Even regarding the previous Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, although it did not reach an agreement itself, it still played a role in exchanging views to prepare for this conference. At the same time, the US's stubborn attitude in the previous Paris Foreign Ministers Conference and afterwards, while failing to change the post-war European situation, instead aroused American public opinion's criticism of US foreign policy. The American New Republic Weekly stated, "Our diplomacy is not working." Under these circumstances, Byrnes's attitude at this Foreign Ministers Conference was not as domineering as last time. In addition to the above basic reasons, the US authorities, in implementing their foreign policy, had to consider the upcoming congressional elections. The US will hold elections for all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the Senators in November of this year. In the election campaigns, foreign policy is an important topic, and continuing to worsen relations with the Soviet Union and continuing a stalemate policy would be very unfavorable to the Democratic Party's election campaign. Recently, the Republican Party has also been vigorously criticizing the government's foreign policy to gain popular favor. John Foster Dulles, the foreign policy advisor to the 1944 Republican presidential candidate Dewey, wrote on June 3 that "American diplomacy should minimize conflicts with the Soviet Union as much as possible"; "Hatred, confrontation, and arms race are not diplomacy, not the direction that diplomats should strive for." Not only that, but even within the Democratic Party, divisions have emerged on foreign policy. Stettinius's resignation is one example.
    Secondly, although the British representative still agreed with the United States on many issues, there were some changes compared to the previous conference. Before the conference, Bevin expressed anxiety in the House of Commons about the stalemate in the peace treaty drafting work, because the burden of this issue diverted Britain's strength in handling other issues. He said, "The Foreign Ministers Conference does not have truly insurmountable differences." During the conference, Bevin supported the Soviet demand for reparations from Italy, and Molotov considered his amendment on the Danube River issue to be worthy of consideration. Bevin's attitude is not unrelated to the recent increase in Anglo-American contradictions (such as the delay in US loans to Britain and the US's increasingly intense pressure on Britain on the Palestine issue, etc.).
    France played an even more obvious role as a mediator at this conference. It proposed more than half a dozen compromise solutions at the conference, which can be explained by France's recent internal and external situation. The recent US loan to France was small in quantity and came with harsh conditions, while the Soviet Union's food aid to France was very generous and swift. At the same time, domestic democratic forces in France once again demonstrated their strength in the recent general election, which has a great influence on France's foreign policy. Also, Bidault's foreign policy is to restore France to the ranks of great powers, and the issue of the five peace treaties has no direct and significant interest to France, so it is natural to adopt an attitude between the two.
    Finally, the Soviet Union played a decisive role in the success of the conference. At the meeting, the Soviet representative resolutely opposed those arbitrary and domineering dangerous tendencies that violated the wartime decisions of the Big Three and undermined the principle of unanimous agreement among the Big Three, and insisted on legitimate and reasonable demands; on the other hand, it made necessary compromises so that the conference could reach an agreement. The Soviet delegation stated: "We have come to Paris this time determined to make the conference a success, and to achieve this goal, we are even willing to compromise." In fact, the Soviet Union made many concessions not only on the issue of Trieste, but also on other issues.
    All of these are the reasons why the Foreign Ministers Conference reached an agreement on the drafts of the five peace treaties.
    (3) Disputes and Agreements
    Naturally, as is well known, almost all important agreements are reached after fierce debates and several compromises. The US representative tried hard to stick to his own opinions on many issues, and only accepted compromises after a long stalemate. The most prominent example is the US's vigorous opposition to the Soviet Union's demand for "100 million US dollars" in reparations from Italy (note: US and British troops had obtained nearly 400 million US dollars in supplies in Italy). This fact shows that even on less important and relatively minor issues, the US still haggled over every detail, making it a source of dispute. The harmony, smoothness, and speed with which the most important issues were resolved at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences during the war seem to belong to a bygone era.
    However, the relationship between the Big Three is, after all, peaceful, which contradicts the imagination of those international reactionaries who fear that the world will not be chaotic. Although the road is difficult, tortuous, and full of thorns, the principle of the Big Three agreement is still maintained after the war. The Foreign Ministers Conference on the five peace treaty drafts has struck a blow to those conspirators who are trying to break up the Big Three, isolate the Soviet Union, and provoke a third world war.
    (4) Europe and the Far East
    After this Foreign Ministers Conference, the cause of building post-war world peace has taken a step forward. Although the four foreign ministers only broadly exchanged views on the major German issue, and the agreement on the five peace treaty drafts is not complete, and serious disputes will occur at the upcoming 21-nation Paris Peace Conference, the general trend is that the five peace treaties will be signed, which will be a major contribution to the peace and stability of Europe and to the cause of the United Nations.
    The post-war reconstruction issues in Europe, except for the German and Austrian issues, have largely come to an end. From now on, the world's attention will be more focused on the East. The Chinese fascist warmongers hope every day that the three foreign ministers will fail and that US-Soviet relations will break down, so as to obtain more support from international reactionary forces. However, this meeting of the three foreign ministers has once again proved that the development of events is exactly the opposite of their wishes.

　　论巴黎外长会议
    韦德
    （一）成就
    负责起草意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案的第二次巴黎外长会议已经闭幕，会议历时二十八天，获得了重大成就。
    在这些成就中，最重要的是对五国和约草案的基本问题达到了协议。在取得这个协议之前，外长会议曾解决一系列的有关问题，如关于的里雅斯特问题，会议通过的不是苏联代表的最初提出的归南斯拉夫的方案，也不是美国代表原先坚持的归意大利计划，而是一个折衷方案，规定的城为国际共管的自治区。关于意殖民地问题，会议绕过这个可能使草拟和约工作搁浅的暗礁，而决定今后一年内再行予以解决。关于意大利赔款问题，由于法英代表的支持，会议通过了与苏联原案无大出入的决定。关于多瑙河问题，会议通过了为法国代表所修正的英国建议。次于这些协议，草拟五国和约的道路，终于铺平了。
    这次会议所以能获得重大成就，其原因何在呢？
    （二）背景
    先从美国方面说起，美国人民大众渴望持久和平，不少美国资本家希望战后安全，以便有发展贸易机会。而要世界安定，非有美苏妥协不行，因此今日以杜鲁门为首的美国当局，虽然不断对苏联进行严重的斗争（表现在历次国际会议上的争论），虽然积极增强军备，以期压倒任何其他国家（表现在原子弹试验、基地计划等），虽然他的政策时为最反动一派（如范登堡等）所影响，可是他的基本方针，仍然是和苏联取得有条件的妥协。即就上次巴黎外长会议而言，虽然本身未获协议，但是仍然起了交换意见准备此次会议的作用。同时，美方在上次巴黎外长会议中及其以后，固执己见的态度，既不能改变战后欧洲的局面，却反而引起美国舆论对美外交政策的责备。美国新共和周刊就这样说：“我们的外交行不通”。在这种情况下，贝纳斯在这次外长会议上的态度，便不象上次那样专横。除了上述基本原因以外，美当局在执行外交政策的过程中，不能不考虑到行将到来的国会改选。美国将于今年十一月改选全部众议员和三分之一参议员，在竞选运动中，外交政策是重要的题目，继续对苏关系恶化，继续僵局政策，对民主党竞选是很不利的。而共和党方面最近亦极力指责政府对外政策，以猎人民的好感。一九四四年共和党总统候选人杜威的外交顾问杜勒斯，即曾于六月三日撰文称：“美国外交应尽量减少对苏联的冲突”；“仇恨、对抗、备战，不是外交，不是外交家努力的方向”。不仅如此，即在民主党内部，在外交政策上也发生分裂。斯退丁纽斯的引退，即其一例。
    其次，英国代表虽然在不少问题上仍与美国一致，但和上次会议比较，也有某些改变。在会议前，贝文在下院演说时，对和约草拟工作的僵持，曾表示焦虑，因为这个问题的拖累，分散了英国处理其他问题的力量。他曾说：“外长会议并没有真正不可克服的分歧”。在会议过程中，贝文曾支持苏联的对意赔款的要求，而其关于多瑙河问题的修正案，也被莫洛托夫认为有考虑的价值。贝文这种态度，与近来英美矛盾的增长（如美国与英国的贷款拖延以及美国在巴勒斯坦问题上一步紧一步的压迫英国等）不是没有关系的。
    法国在这次会议上，更明显地处于调解人的地位，它在会议上曾提了半打以上的折衷方案，这可以从法国最近时期的内外情况得到解释。不久以前的美国对法贷款，数量既微少，条件又苛刻，而苏联对法国的粮食援助，则极慷慨而迅速。同时，法国国内民主力量在最近大选中，再次表现其坚强，这个对法国的外交政策有极大的影响。还有，比道尔的外交政策是使法国重登强国之林，而五国和约问题对法国无直接的重大利害关系，因此便采取介乎两者之间的态度，是很自然的。
    最后苏联，它对于会议的成就，具有决定意义的作用。苏联代表在会上，一方面坚决反对那些独断专横、违反三强战时决定、以及破坏三强一致协议原则等危险倾向，坚持正当合理的要求；另一方面又作了必要的妥协，以便会议达到协议。苏联代表团曾表示：“此次前来巴黎，决使会议获得成功，为达此目的，甚至不惜以妥协为代价”事实上，不仅在的里雅斯特问题上，而且在其他问题上，苏联作了不少让步。
    所有这些，就是此次外长会议对五国和约草案获得协议的原因。
    （三）争执与协议
    自然，如众所周知，差不多所有重要协议，都是在激烈的争论、几度折衷以后才达到的。美国代表在许多问题上都曾竭力固执己见，一直僵持到最后才接受妥协。最显著的例子，就是对苏联要求意赔款“一万万美元”，美方曾竭力反对（按：美英驻军曾在意国取得近四十万万美元的供应）。这一事实，显露即使在不大重要的、比较细小问题上，美方仍然锱铢必较，使其成为争论。战争时期，德黑兰、雅尔塔、波茨顿会议中，解决最重大问题的那种和洽顺利以及迅速，似已成为上一个时代的产物了。
    然而，三强之间的关系，终究是和平的，是与那些唯恐天下不乱的国际反动派的想象相违反的。尽管道路是艰难曲折和荆棘丛生的，但是到底三强协议的原则仍然在战后维系着。外长会议关于五国和约草案的会议，打击了那些力图使三强破裂，使苏联陷于孤立，挑拨第三次世界大战的阴谋家。
    （四）欧洲和远东
    经过了这次外长会议之后，缔造战后世界和平事业，已向前迈进了一步了。虽然四强外长对重大的德国问题，仅仅广泛的交换了意见，而对五国和约草案的协议并不完全，在行将召开的二十一国巴黎和会中还会发生严重的争执，但是大势所趋，五国和约是要签订的，这对于欧洲的和平安定，对联合国事业将是一个重大的贡献。
    战后欧洲的善后问题，除德奥问题外，大体上已告一段落了，此后世界的目光，将更转移集中到东方来，中国法西斯好战派天天盼望三外长失败，美苏关系破裂，以便从国际反动势力获得更多的支持。但是，这次三外长会议，又证明事变的发展，恰恰和他们的愿望相反。
