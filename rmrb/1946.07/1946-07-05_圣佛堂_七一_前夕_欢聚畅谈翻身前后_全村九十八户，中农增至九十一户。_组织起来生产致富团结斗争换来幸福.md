[Our newspaper from Weixian reports] On the eve of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Communist Party of China, cadres, labor heroes, and mutual aid team leaders from Saint Buddha Hall Village, Seventh District, Weixian County, gathered together to celebrate "July 1st" and joyfully discussed their lives since liberation and the changes in the entire village over the past three years. Everyone unanimously felt that under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the democratic government, by implementing the correct policies of rent reduction and interest rate reduction and organizing the people, the working peasants who had suffered from feudal exploitation and oppression for thousands of years had undergone a historic liberation movement and begun to establish a new life of their own in terms of economy, politics, and culture. The whole village has taken on a completely new look.

Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Saint Buddha Hall Village was a well-known wealthy village, but as Geng Lanyu, director of the farmers' association, said: "It was a wealthy village for a few landlords; the wealthier they became, the poorer we became." Of the 3,424 mu of land in the entire village, five landlord households owned 1,555 mu, accounting for 45 percent of the village's land; seven rich peasant households owned 597 mu, accounting for 17 percent of the village's land; while 54 middle peasant households owned only 976 mu; and 34 poor peasant households owned only 296 mu. The large landlord Zhang Fenglin's family alone owned 800 mu of land. The vast majority of middle and poor peasants suffered from heavy rents and oppression, as well as high-interest exploitation, with interest rates as high as 10 percent. The landlords lived a life of extravagance and debauchery on the blood and sweat of the peasants, as Zhang Fenglin himself said: "I eat a big steamed bun every day, and I don't spend a penny of my own money."

In the years following the War of Resistance Against Japan, although the landlords' land decreased, their foundation of exploitation and rule remained basically unshaken, and the working peasants still lived in hunger and poverty. During the severe famine in 1943, only about twenty people remained in the village. During this disaster, the democratic government distributed grain for relief and organized transportation, finding a way out for the people. Gu Decai and others saved their entire families through transportation. In the spring of 1944, the government patiently educated everyone to "organize," and those who had "fled the famine" gradually returned. Everyone used mutual aid to jointly break free from the disaster. In the winter, under the leadership of Shi Decai, Geng Lanyu, and others, a struggle to redeem land (land that had been sold due to the famine) was launched. In the spring of 1945, the rent reduction and interest rate reduction liberation struggle against the large landlords and bullies such as Zhang Fenglin and Chen Jiawen was launched. The peasants recovered the fruits of their labor, broke free from the shackles of feudal exploitation, and their enthusiasm for production was greatly increased. They organized the village's labor force, overcame natural disasters, and developed sideline occupations, earning more than 500,000 yuan. The living standards of the working people have risen rapidly. Currently, out of the 98 households in the village, only 4 are poor peasant households, and middle peasant households have increased to 91, owning 2,438 mu of land. This spring, the middle peasants built 56 new brick houses. The women are busy spinning and weaving. Shi Decai's family has added four new quilts, three new robes, eleven new cotton-padded jackets, three new lined jackets, and seven or eight new unlined garments. After the wheat harvest, every family's meals have been changed to steamed buns. After the economic liberation and two or three years of winter school education, the peasants have gradually overcome ignorance. Sixty children of poor peasants, who were previously denied access to school, are now enrolled in elementary school. In recent years, the social customs of the village have also greatly changed, and the good-for-nothings have turned to honest work. Mutual aid has become a habit, and seventeen poor bachelors have all married wives. Everyone knows that happy days come from unity and mutual assistance. Various organizations have been established, and leaders who are loved by the masses have emerged in the struggle, such as labor hero Shi Decai and farmers' association director Geng Lanyu. Knowing where their happiness comes from, they have successively sent twenty-two of their children to join the Eighth Route Army and work for the government, and have comforted their own soldiers with shoes, socks, meat, and vegetables worth 30,000 yuan. The entire village has won awards such as "Model for Expanding the Army" and "Model for Grain Delivery."

　　圣佛堂“七一”前夕
    欢聚畅谈翻身前后
    全村九十八户，中农增至九十一户。
    组织起来生产致富团结斗争换来幸福
    【本报威县讯】为庆祝中国共产党二十五周年，威县七区圣佛堂村的干部，劳动英雄、互助队长等，纪念“七一”的前夕，大伙欢聚一堂，畅谈三年来的翻身生活和全村变化情形。大家一致感到在共产党和民主政府的领导帮助之下，执行了减租减息与组织起来的正确方针，千百年封建剥削压迫下的劳苦农民，进行了历史的翻身运动，开始建立自己经济、政治、文化的新生活，全村面貌焕然一新。
    抗战前圣佛堂村原是个有名的富村，但正如农会主任耿兰玉所说：“那是少数几家老财的富村，他们越富，咱们就越穷。”在全村三千四百二十四亩土地中，五户地主共有地一千五百五十五亩，占全村土地百分之四十五；富农七户，有地五百九十七亩，占全村土地百分之十七；而中农五十四户，仅有地九百七十六亩；贫农三十四户，仅有地二百九十六亩。村中大地主张风林一家，即拥有土地八百亩。广大中贫农除受重和压榨外，还受着高利盘剥，利息有高到十分的。地主们靠农民的血汗过着骄奢淫逸的生活，正如张风林自己说：“我一天吃一节大蒸饱，吃不着我自己一个钱。”
    抗战后来的几年间，地主土地虽减少，但其剥削统治基础，基本未动摇，劳苦农民仍生活于饥饿贫困之中。四三年灾荒严重时全村逃剩二十余人。在这灾难时期，民主政府发粮救济组织运输，给人民找到了出路，古德才等曾因运输救活了全家。四四年春政府耐心教育大家“组织起来”、“逃荒”的人也逐渐回来了，大家以互助力量共同挣脱灾荒。冬季在石德才、耿兰玉等领导下，展开了赎地斗争（因灾荒被迫卖去的地），四五年春紧接着展开了对大地主恶霸张风林陈家文等的减租减息翻身斗争，农民取回了果实，摆脱了封建剥削的枷锁，生产情绪大大提高，组织了全村的劳力，战胜了天灾，又发展了副业，共赚洋五十余万元。劳动人民的生活飞速上升，现全村九十八户，贫农只有四户，中农增为九十一户，占有土地二千四百三十八亩。今春中农们新盖了五十六间砖房。妇女们紧张的纺织，如石德才家即添置了新棉被四床，新袍三件，新棉衣十一件，新夹衣三件，新单衣七八件。麦收后家家饭食都换成了馍馍。经过经济上的翻身和二三年来的冬学教育，农民逐渐克服了愚昧，以前被拒于校门之外的贫农子弟，现有六十个进了小学。几年来村中社会风俗也大大改变，二流子都转务正业，互助已成习惯，十七个穷光汉都娶了媳妇。大家知道幸福的日子是团结互助得来的。各种组织都建立起来，斗争中产生了群众自己爱戴的领袖，如劳动英雄石得才、农会主任耿兰玉等。饮水恩源，他们知道自己幸福是从那里来的，他们先后送自己子弟二十二人参加八路军和政府工作，曾以价值三万元的鞋袜肉菜等，慰劳自己的子弟兵。全村曾荣获“扩军模范”、“交粮模范”等奖旗。
