　　[Special Dispatch from Heze, July 3rd by Our Newspaper] The Kuomintang reactionaries dispatched secret agents from Jinan who infiltrated the liberated areas and brutally murdered all the cadres of our Changqing Repair and Defense Section. The Changqing Repair and Defense Section's levee repair project has been completed. On the 14th of last month, Zhang Xingnong, the section chief, led engineer Zhang Xing and all the cadres, a group of seven people, to inspect the levee project. When they arrived at Xixiaoyan Village in the Eighth District, Engineer Zhang Xing and the other six were deceived into a peasant's courtyard by secret agents lurking in the village under the guise of being "one of us". They were hung from the beams and cruelly tortured. The secret agents shouted, "We are the Central Army, here specifically to find you. We are old enemies, and we won't be satisfied until we kill you all!" When Section Chief Zhang arrived from behind, trying to rescue them, he was shot by the secret agents and hit by three bullets, dying a heroic death. The secret agents then used kitchen knives, sickles, and other tools to hack and stab the bound Engineer Zhang Xing and the others until their tendons were broken, their bones fractured, and their flesh was a bloody mess. Except for one cook who escaped, all the others were killed. After committing the atrocity, the secret agents fled north. After the tragedy occurred, the masses along the river were filled with grief and indignation. The mood to avenge the fallen martyrs was extremely high, and they unanimously condemned this vile and shameless bloody crime of the Kuomintang reactionaries to the entire country.
　　
　　[Special Dispatch from Heze, July 4th by Our Newspaper] The Kuomintang reactionaries, on the one hand, were throwing stones and releasing water at Huayuankou, and on the other hand, they were directing stubborn puppet troops and secret agents in Qi Yu, Changqing, Changyuan and other county towns to harass and kill cadres and masses repairing the dikes, and to plunder wantonly. On the 9th of last month, Yang Xiao and other Kuomintang secret agents numbering more than 30 from Qi Yu City, in coordination with the more than 300 men of the puppet Li Lianxiang's unit, attacked the Jiasi and Xiaolizhuang areas along the river, killing three people from the dike repair masses and carrying out large-scale looting, but were repelled by our garrison. On the evening of the 16th, Sun Kang and Fang Zege, puppet troops from Changqing City, led more than 20 men from the puppet Ninth District Team to sneak into the village where the dike repair workers were stationed. Taking advantage of the workers' sleep, they captured Li Xingjie, the dike repair squad leader, and Lu Guangchen, the quartermaster, and brutally beat the workers, and robbed 1,200 jin of white flour that the workers had prepared as rations. On the evening of the 17th, more than 10 men from the puppet Eighth District Team attacked Liuji Village and beat to death Zhao Lianying, the director of our village farmers' association. At the same time, Zheng Chuangguang, the leader of the secret service team, led more than 10 secret agents to Chuanfeng and beat to death Zhang Shiban, the village chief, and Zhang Yechang, the former director of the farmers' association, and captured Zhang Yebao, a cadre of the district armed forces committee. On the afternoon of the 18th, Zheng Chuangguang and others again went to the dike repair site in Feicheng's Eighth District to carry out large-scale looting and harassment. At dawn on the 23rd, a unit of the Kuomintang army from Changyuan, carrying more than 10 machine guns, suddenly attacked the liberated area villages near the county's dam, killing 12 of our militiamen, armed forces committee cadres, and masses.

　　Currently, the dike repair and defense sections in the counties along the river in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region have issued a call to armed to protect the levee repair, increasing the number of militiamen, strengthening river defenses, establishing a patrol and sentry system and a joint defense system, and strictly preventing Kuomintang secret agents and stubborn puppets from sabotaging the river control project.
