The Ji'nan District Party Committee, Military Region, and Administrative Office Call on the Entire District's Military and Civilians to Practice Strict Economy and Rush to Plant

[This newspaper's Weixian dispatch of the 19th] A drought has formed in the vast majority of Ji'nan, and the early seedlings are confirmed to have a poor harvest, while most of the late seedlings have not yet been planted. The Ji'nan District Party Committee, the Ji'nan Administrative Office, and the Military Region have jointly issued a call, urging all the military and civilians in the district to prevent drought and prepare for famine. The call urges labor heroes, mass leaders, and village-level cadres to immediately take the lead in formulating family-based famine preparedness plans. The call points out that the entire district should quickly prepare for late planting, carrying water to plant seedlings and rushing to plant late-season crops. Governments at all levels, agencies, troops, affiliated stores, and cooperatives should all help the masses transport seeds. Each soldier, agency worker, and student should strive to plant 100 jin of vegetables and hand them over to their units to prepare for the food shortage. It also calls for reducing the amount of grain, intensifying conservation, not wasting a single grain of rice, saving expenses, and reducing the burden on the people. Finally, the call points out that we must start immediately from now and not repeat the painful experience of the 1942 poor harvest, where the failure to conserve grain led to the great famine of 1943.

　　冀南区党委军区行署号召
    全区军民厉行节约抢种
    【本报威县十九日电】冀南绝大部分地区旱灾形成，早苗已确定歉收，晚苗大部尚未下种。冀南区党委、冀南行署、军区特发出联合号召，号召全区军民防旱备荒。号召劳动英雄、群众领袖、村级干部立即带头制定按家备荒计划。号召中指出全区应迅速准备进行晚种，挑水点苗、抢种晚种作物，各级政府各机关部队所属商店及合作社均应帮助群众贩运种籽，各部队、各机关、学校每人应争取种一百斤菜，交给本单位以备粮荒。并准备减少粮食数量，加紧节约，不浪费一粒米，节省开支，减轻民负。最后号召中指出要立即从现在做起，不要重复四二年歉收时，没有节约粮食造成四三年大灾荒的惨痛经验。
