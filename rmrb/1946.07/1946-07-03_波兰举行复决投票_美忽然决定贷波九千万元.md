    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th] Washington Dispatch: Three days before the Polish referendum, the US State Department suddenly decided to grant Poland a loan of 90 million US dollars, on the condition that Poland should make public to the United States all economic agreements with other countries (including the Soviet Union). The US State Department has suspended the allocation of 40 million US dollars from the Export-Import Bank loan to Poland, pending Poland's further implementation of certain obligations. Now, with the Polish referendum imminent, the US suddenly pays part of the loan to Poland, and its intentions are indeed noteworthy.
