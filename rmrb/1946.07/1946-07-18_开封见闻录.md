　　Record of What I Saw and Heard in Kaifeng
Kaifeng now has nine newspapers, but unfortunately, they are all mouthpieces of the Kuomintang. The large number is merely for show. The *Minguo Daily* is the official newspaper of the provincial party headquarters; the *Henan Minbao* is the official newspaper of the provincial government; the *Lixing Daily* is the official newspaper of the Military Intelligence Bureau; the *Dahe Daily* is the official newspaper of the Intelligence Section of the First War Zone Headquarters; the *Youth Daily* is the newspaper of the Three People's Principles Youth League; the *Minquan News* is the official newspaper of the Provincial Assembly. *Jianguo News* is the newspaper of the students from the War-time Cadre Training Corps stationed in Bian [Kaifeng]; *Henan Evening News* is the newspaper of the Whampoa Military Academy Alumni Association; *China Times* seems to be a relatively fair newspaper, but because Guo XX, the Supervisor of Henan and Shandong, is the father of the newspaper's president, it is inevitable that it speaks for the Supervisor's Office. Precisely because it is not a purely Kuomintang mouthpiece, the provincial party headquarters and the Military Intelligence Office put pressure on it. The president, Guo Haichang, had to publish an apology, saying that due to a momentary oversight in the past, the newspaper's opinions were mostly inappropriate (?), and that in addition to replacing the editor, he would publish an apology to all sectors. After that, the newspaper only sang praises! Recently, the Social Affairs Department also established a news office to replace the former news censorship office. Besides using the Central News Agency's稿 (news稿), no one is allowed to listen to the radio themselves, not even the news from New Delhi's broadcast, because they say the New Delhi radio station is being used by the Communist Party – only heaven knows if this is true. There are three prohibitions for newspaper editors: one, they are not allowed to mention democracy; two, they are not allowed to oppose the civil war; three, they are not allowed to criticize. They say that only the Communist Party does these things, so in the newspapers, one only sees "Iron-blooded recovery of the Northeast," "Abolish the Border Regions,"...
    The editor of *Dahe Daily* was punished for reprinting a truthful report from *Wenhui Bao* about the "Jiaochangkou Incident." The provincial party headquarters and the Three People's Principles Youth League frequently give instructions to the newspapers, telling them what editorials to write and what articles to publish. In early April, they instructed all newspapers to write editorials welcoming the U.S. military to be stationed in North China to transport Japanese prisoners of war back to their country. The instruction concluded by saying: "As long as the U.S. military is in North China, it will be beneficial to the Kuomintang and detrimental to the Eighth Route Army."

    In Kaifeng, an election was held for the chairman of the Henan Provincial General Chamber of Commerce, with representatives from the county Chambers of Commerce voting. The candidates were Zhou Jintang, Du Xiusheng, and Miao Chongxiu. They started preparing a month before the election, sending gifts to the newspapers in the hope that they would promote them. Zhou Jintang sent 500,000 yuan to *Minquan News* at once and promised to provide a monthly subsidy of 800,000 yuan after his success. Du Xiusheng and Miao Chongxiu spent money to buy votes, initially at 10,000 yuan per vote. When Zhou Jintang offered 150,000 yuan, they offered 200,000 yuan per vote. Later, someone mediated, and the three of them were all made standing directors, taking turns as chairman, with each county representative receiving 200,000 yuan. Naturally, there were no more complaints.

    The Kaifeng branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has been established for two or three months this year, but there is still no work being done. I visited Director Ma Jie, and he said, "There is no suitable office space now, so we cannot start work." Later, they were given two large buildings of the YMCA. Besides giving each of the 1,500 refugees three catties of white flour, nothing else was done. Ma Jie wanted to sell the American-donated suits to buy Chinese clothes to distribute to the refugees. All parties strongly opposed, saying that the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration wanted to profit from it. The suits were not sold, so they went to various second-hand clothing stores to buy a large number of old suits, intending to replace the good suits. This news was reported in detail by *Lixing Daily*.
    The staff of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are all wearing suits and leather shoes, and all of them are well-fed. The people of Kaifeng call them the "Relief-Themselves Administration."
    The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has been holding meetings and receiving money every day since its establishment, but no achievements have been made. Therefore, this saying is popular in Kaifeng: "Yellow River water, benefits the committee members, meeting."

　　开封见闻录
    开封现在有九家报纸，可惜他们都是国民党的御用报纸，数目多的原因，不过是装饰门面而已。民国日报是省党部的机关报，河南民报是省政府的机关报，力行日报是军统局的机关报，大河日报是一战区长官部情报科的机关报，青年日报是三青团的机关报纸，民权新闻是省参议会的机关报。建国新闻是战干团留汴同学会的报纸，河南晚报，是黄埔军校同学会的报纸，中国时报似乎是比较立场公正的报纸，可是因为豫鲁监察使郭××是该报社社长的父亲，所以就免不了要替监察使署谈话，正因为它不是一个国民党的纯粹的机关报，所以省党部军统室就向他施以压力，社长郭海长不得不登报道歉，说过去一时疏忽，报上言论多所不妥（？），现在除更换编辑外，并登报向各界道歉，以后报上就只有歌功颂德了！最近社会处又成立了一个新闻室，代替过去的新闻检查所。新闻除去采用中央社稿外，一概不准自己收听，连新德里的广播新闻都不准收听，他们说新德里广播电台受共产党利用，这只有天知道了。报纸编辑有三不准，一不准提民主，二不准反内战，三不准批评，他们说这些事只有共产党才干的，所以报上，只见“铁血收复东北”，“取消边区”，……
    大河日报编辑因为从文汇报转载一篇关于“较场口事件”的真实报导，而受到处分。省党部和三青团经常给各报纸去指令，告诉写什么社论，登什么文章，在四月初，曾指令各报写，《欢迎美军在华北驻防，以运送日俘返国的社论》，该指令最后说：“只要美军在华北一天，就与国民党有利一天，就与八路军无利一天”。

    在开封曾经选举过一次河南省商工公会理事长，由各县商公会代表投票，参加竞选的是周锦堂，杜秀升，苗重秀。在选举前一个月就开始布置了，向各报社送礼希望替他们鼓吹，周锦堂给民权新闻一下子就送去五十万，并且答应成功以后，每月津贴八十万，杜秀升和苗重秀就花钱收买选票，起初一张票一万元，等到周锦堂出到十五万元的时候，他们出了二十万元一张，后来有人从中说和，他们三个人都算常务理事，轮流当理事长，各县代表每人得二十万元，当然这才不说什么了。

    救济总署开封分署本年成立了两三个月，还不见有什么工作，我去访问马杰署长，他说：“现在没有适当办公地点，所以不能展开工作”，后来，把青年会的两所大楼让给他们了，除了发给一千五百名难民每人三斤白面，再也不见有什么工作。马杰想把那些美国捐赠的西服卖了，买中国衣服发给难民、各方坚决反对，说是救济总署要从中捞一把，西服没卖成，他们就到各估衣铺收买大批破西服打算替换好西服，这个消息被力行日报大登特登。
    救济总署的职员个个西服革履，个个吃得油光满面，开封老百姓都叫他们“救己总署”。
    黄河水利委员会，从成立起就天天开会，领钱，没有什么成绩表现出来，所以在开封就流行这句话：“黄河水，利委员，会。”
