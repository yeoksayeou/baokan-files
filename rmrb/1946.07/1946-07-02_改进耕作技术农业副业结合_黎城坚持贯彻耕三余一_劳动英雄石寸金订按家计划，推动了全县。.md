　　Improving Farming Techniques, Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations
    Licheng Persists in Implementing "Cultivate Three, Surplus One"
    Labor Hero Shi Cunjin Orders Plans by Household, Promoting the Whole County.
    [Reported by this Newspaper] According to the United Office of the Licheng County Government: Licheng has achieved significant results in this year's spring production campaign, with the spring plowing and sowing campaign completed by the end of May. In promoting improved varieties, the county planted 25,756 mu of Jin Huanghou corn and 39,971 mu of cotton (originally planned for 30,000 mu). The county increased its livestock by 574 head. According to statistics from the first and third districts, 41,720 jin of thread were spun, and 14,019 zhang of cloth were woven, earning 2,223,099 yuan. There emerged 975 small-scale cooperative transportation groups combining agriculture and sideline occupations, and 2,199 labor heroes and activists, as well as 1,369 spinning and weaving activists. The reason for these achievements is that the county paid attention to and clarified the policy of "Cultivate Three, Surplus One," and promoted the enthusiasm of the masses. For example, in the sixth district, labor hero Shi Cunjin's household-based plans promoted and influenced other villages to also make plans. Hongjing Village held symposiums for people from all walks of life, resolving the "fear of getting rich" ideology, especially by educating the masses with the story of labor hero Shi Cunjin's labor-based success. Secondly, the importance of improving farming techniques was recognized, and many villages established technical research and guidance committees, such as Xiaguihua Village and Henan Village, paying special attention to the research on planting Jin Huanghou corn and cotton, and paying attention to timely inspection and commendation. In terms of deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, the county's autumn land totaled 237,361 mu, and 169,606 mu were double-harrowed, more than double the area harrowed last year. The county's wheat land totaled 115,248 mu, and 7,954 mu were weeded, more than triple the area weeded last year. In promoting agricultural tools, Pengzhuang Village changed large harrows to small harrows, saving both animal power and labor. In particular, the county carried out a campaign to eliminate black insects, organizing 13,963 auxiliary laborers who killed 2,249 jin of insects. If they had not been killed, the insects could have eaten 1,460 mu of crops. There has also been progress in organizing the masses, with 56,210 people organized out of a total of 92,734 people in the county, accounting for more than 60% (including spinning and weaving). The county has 3,117 mutual aid teams, of which 1,037 are relatively good teams, 1,526 are general teams, and 554 are temporary teams. Most of the mutual aid teams have undergone democratic reviews, resolving the problems left over from last year, and further achieving conscientiousness, democracy, fairness, and reasonableness. In terms of wages, in general, physical objects are used as the standard, and decisions are made and settled on a quarterly basis. At the same time, in order to implement the policy of "Cultivate Three, Surplus One," we also seized the opportunity to combine agriculture and sideline occupations. Through precise calculations, surplus labor and animal power were extracted to form shares for sideline production, and sideline occupations were developed in a planned manner to consolidate mutual aid teams and combine agriculture and sideline occupations without causing conflicts. In terms of the work style of cadres, special attention was paid to promoting democracy and commending the democratic work style and creativity of cadres.
