Handan City Tongxing Jade Shoe Store After Reasoning and Struggle, Unity Between Master and Apprentice Improves Production

[Handan News] After democratic reasoning and struggle at the Tongxing Jade Shoe Store in this city, unity and cooperation between master and apprentice have been achieved, and production efficiency has improved. Apprentice Zhang Genshu, while applying white powder to the sole of a shoe the other day, accidentally soiled the shoe upper. The shopkeeper, Liu Qingzhi, immediately reprimanded and beat him. Upon learning of this, the shop assistants' union summoned Zhang Genshu to inquire about the truth and offered comfort. On the 20th, the union convened fifty or sixty shop assistants to reason with Liu. At the meeting, Zhang Genshu recounted the various abuses he had suffered and demanded that clothing be provided as stipulated. The shop assistants present immediately questioned Liu fairly: "Do you think treating apprentices kindly will make the business better, or will beating and scolding them make the business better?" "The agreement you made promised to provide clothing; has it been provided after two and a half years?" Knowing he was in the wrong, Liu Qingzhi criticized himself, saying, "I only gave him a small jacket in the first year and didn't provide anything else. I was being stingy. I admit my punishment. Let's recalculate the accounts and refund him!" Everyone said, "It's good that you admit your mistake. We won't punish you or recalculate the past accounts. We'll just see how you treat him in the future!" Liu Qingzhi was deeply grateful and immediately promised to abolish beatings and scoldings, reduce the apprenticeship period from four years to three, and provide a set of padded and unpadded clothing each year, along with four pairs of shoes and socks, as originally agreed. He also promised to grant freedom to attend meetings and return home for study, provided it didn't interfere with business, and a new agreement was drawn up as evidence. Zhang Genshu also automatically offered a guarantee on the spot: "As long as the shopkeeper treats me like this, I will definitely work hard. If I'm supposed to make six pairs, I'll make seven pairs. If I'm supposed to sleep at nine o'clock, I'll sleep at ten o'clock. I will definitely make the shop more money." After the meeting, the union representatives sent Zhang back to the shop and instructed him to make more shoes and work hard. Liu Qingzhi said to others: "I didn't expect them to handle it so well this time!" Zhang Genshu's production enthusiasm is now extremely high.

　　邯市同兴玉鞋铺说理斗争后
    师徒团结生产提高
    【邯郸讯】本市同兴玉鞋铺经过民主说理斗争，达到师徒团结合作，生产效率提高。该号学徒张根书，日前以白粉涂抹鞋底时，偶一不慎稍污鞋帮，即遭掌柜刘青之责备打骂。店员公会得悉此事，即将张根书叫去询问真象，并加安慰。并于二十日召集店员五六十人与刘说理。会上张根书诉说自己所受的各种虐待，要求按规定供给衣着，到会店员随即将刘提出公正质问：“你说给徒弟和和气气的能把买卖作好，还是打打骂骂能把买卖作好？”“从前你们订的约要发穿，两年半了到底你发没发？”刘掌柜自知理屈，自己批评说：“就头年给他个小袄，别的没管，这都是我刻薄他，我认罚，从头算算帐退给他吧！”大家说：“你认错就对了，咱们也不罚你，也不算过去的帐了，只看你今后怎样待他吧！”刘掌柜感激不尽，当即答应今后要废除打骂，将四年学艺期减为三年，并照原约每年发给棉夹衣各一套，单衣两套，鞋袜各四双，在不妨碍营业的条件下，给予开会回家学习等自由，并立新约为据。张根书当场也自动提出保证：“只要掌柜这样待我，我一定好好干，该上六双的时我上七双，该九点钟睡觉我十点钟睡，一定要使柜上多赚钱。”会后，公会代表把张送回柜上，又一面叮嘱张一定要多上鞋，好好干。刘掌柜对别人说：这一回我想不到人家真处理得好！现在张根书的生产情绪极为高涨。
