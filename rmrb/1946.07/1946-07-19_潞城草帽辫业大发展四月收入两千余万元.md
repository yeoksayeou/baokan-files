Lucheng Straw Hat Braid Industry Achieves Major Development, April Revenue Exceeds 20 Million Yuan

[This Dispatch From Changzhi] The Lucheng straw hat braid industry is now extremely developed. In the four months from February to June, the county's straw hat industry's revenue has reached a massive 20 million yuan. Lucheng has long been a special product area for straw hat braids in southeastern Shanxi Province. Before the war, annual production exceeded one million jin, sold in Tianjin, Shandong, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Gansu and other places. After the July 7th Incident, due to traffic blockages and enemy sabotage, exports were suspended, and almost all operations ceased. In the spring of 1944, the anti-Japanese government actively organized the restoration of the straw hat braid industry in the liberated areas of the county to lead the masses through the famine year. At that time, due to the extreme shortage of raw materials, only more than 30 villages were organized, producing 30,000 hats in six months of work. In the summer of 1945, a joint straw hat factory was established with nine machines, leading the county's straw hat industry to recover. According to statistics from March to July, the county earned a total profit of one million yuan in four months. After the counter-offensive, with active promotion, the county now has a total of 43 machines. From February to June of this year, a total of 86,000 jin of straw hat braids, 188,000 straw hats, and 3,378 jin of locally produced thread were produced, with a total revenue of 20,026,000 yuan. In addition, the steel needles on the machines break very quickly, and purchasing them is difficult. After painstaking research by Li Huaizhong, a worker at the county's tool factory, a type of locally produced steel needle suitable for use with locally produced thread was created. From then on, wheat stalks, straw braids, and steel needles could all be self-sufficient. The straw hat braid industry in Shexian County is also developing vigorously. This year, farmers have made great profits, and the collection of wheat straw after the wheat harvest is quite active. (Li Jinxiang, Xu Yuancun)

　　潞城草帽辫业大发展四月收入两千余万元
    【本报长治讯】潞城草帽辫业现极发达，二月至六月四个月间，全县草帽业收入已达二千余万元之巨。潞城向为晋东南草帽辫业特产区，战前年产在百万斤以上，行销天津、山东、宁夏、陕甘等地。七七事变后，由于交通阻塞，敌人破坏，输出停顿，几全部停业。四四年春抗日政府为领导群众渡过荒年，曾在该县解放区内积极组织恢复草帽辫业，当时因原料奇缺，只组织起三十余村，做活六个月出帽三万余顶。四五年夏又成立联合草帽工厂，内有机器九架，领导全县的草帽业恢复，三月到七月四个月的统计全县共得利百万元。反攻后又经积极提倡，现全县共有机器四十三架，今年二月到六月四个月共出产草帽辫八万六千斤，草帽一十八万八千顶，土产缀帽洋线三千三百七十八斤，共收入洋二千零二十六万元。又机器上钢针坏的很快，购买也困难，经该县工具厂工人李怀忠苦心研究，造出一种机器用土钢针很适合于使用土线，至此，麦秆、草辫、钢针均能做到自给了。又涉县的草帽辫业也在大力开展，今年农民获利大，麦收后采集麦草颇为积极。（李晋祥、徐元存）
