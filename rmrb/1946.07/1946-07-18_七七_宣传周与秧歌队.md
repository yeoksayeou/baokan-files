"July 7th" Propaganda Week and Yangko Team
    Xiao Fang
    In Handan City, the "July 7th" Propaganda Week not only demonstrated the universality of the work but also penetrated into every corner. From workers, peasants, and citizens to shop assistants and merchants, as long as there were organized masses, in addition to participating in the 20,000-person anti-civil war rally on July 3rd, each organization's members discussed at least once "This year's July 7th anniversary should oppose civil war." They not only discussed it but also turned it into practical action. Zhang Shang of the North Street Citizens' Association not only publicized to the masses in his street but also went to the station area to explain to the masses everywhere. Even women who generally did not care about current affairs were deeply involved in this work. The women's group in Dongmenli universally recognized in the discussion that "We want peace, but Old Jiang insists on fighting a civil war. He is not satisfied with fighting himself, and he even colludes with the bad Americans." A primary school student from the Second Elementary School said after listening to the teacher's current affairs report: "Old Jiang is not satisfied with being bad himself, and he even recognizes an American godfather." Three children running on the street in Weizhuang were asked who was fighting the civil war, and they all answered straightforwardly: "It's Old Jiang!" "If Old Jiang really wants to fight a civil war, we will organize and fight him." This is an even more common roar among the masses of Handan City.
    During the "July 7th" Propaganda Week, the large Yangko teams of the middle school and two elementary schools were particularly noteworthy. The reason they were noticed was that it was the first time such a large-scale Yangko team had performed in the city, but more importantly, their makeup, performance techniques, and content did indeed attract the masses.
    A total of 167 people from the three schools participated in the Yangko team. If the lecture group, painting group, and wall newspaper group that cooperated with the Yangko team are included, the number reached 393, accounting for 70-80% of the total number of students in the school. These people all participated voluntarily, and their enthusiasm was particularly high. After the middle school made the call, more than 80 people signed up automatically. At that time, we thought that there were too many people, and we were afraid that the performance would not be good, so we picked out a few, but the people who were picked out said: "We are not good enough, our skills are not enough, and people won't let us participate!" As a result, some people temporarily squeezed into the team during the performance. Liu Yunqi's serious spirit was focused on the performance, which played an exemplary leading role for the middle school Yangko team, and she performed with illness in the last two times. Li Yongshan also showed an exemplary attitude and used his spare time to complete his picture newspaper task. Elementary school students Su Ying and Wang Xiaochi from the First and Second Elementary Schools have been performing in the hot sun for several days without saying they were tired or showing any fatigue.
    After only two or three days of preparation and rehearsal, the Yangko team of the First Elementary School performed on the street after breakfast on the 3rd. Then on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th, the Yangko teams of the middle school and the Second Elementary School successively traveled all over the urban area and some villages around the city. According to incomplete statistics, the Yangko team of the Second Elementary School attracted 5,400 viewers, the middle school's about 5,200, and although the First Elementary School did not have exact figures, it performed five times in fourteen venues, with 700-800 viewers in each venue with fewer people, and 2,000-3,000 with more people. Even Haozhuang, a small village in the suburbs, attracted more than 200 people.
    As long as people have seen the Yangko team performing on the street, no one says that they didn't perform well. If you also stand in the crowd to watch, you will hear constant applause and nodding in agreement! When the middle school performed the street play "Fleeing Famine," an old man was moved to tears, and many people gave our Yangko team such criticism: "It's even better than a big opera!"
    Due to the performance of this Yangko team, etc., I have some new impressions and feelings:
    1. In the past, some people thought that "songs" and "dramas" were school entertainment activities! Some even thought that this was the leisurely life embellishment of the bourgeoisie after dinner, especially in the newly liberated areas. However, after this large Yangko team performed on the street, this impression changed. In particular, the faculty and staff and students of the school all believe that this is a very good weapon for social propaganda work, and they believe that such activities among the masses are also a very important part of learning. Each Yangko team arranges and performs by themselves, and then revises and rehearses after discovering shortcomings, but there is a basic viewpoint in it, regardless of content and form, it is all aimed at being accepted by the masses, and after the masses put forward their opinions, they will not hesitate to revise it.
    2. The performance of this Yangko team, etc., showed the greatness of the creative power of the broad masses (faculty, staff, and students of the school). The First Elementary School started to compose songs, learn to twist, and gradually transform, and within three days, a very decent Yangko team appeared on the street. The Mass Art Research Association (transformed from the old book class) learned the drum lyrics against the civil war in one day, and met with the masses in a square of two or three thousand people the next day. During the performance, the surrounding applause often drowned out the drum lyrics. The creation of the Second Elementary School has its own prominence. The Yangko is mixed with four fresh songs and clappers, all of which are created by themselves. In front of the Yangko team's line during each performance, there are portraits of great men held up by high poles, self-created paintings, and various slogans, which add a lot of color to the Yangko team's performance. Not to mention the great line of the middle school Yangko team, the time from writing the script, rehearsing, to performing for several street plays was no more than three days. A student who participated in the propaganda team said: "When I was in the propaganda team, there was a ready-made script, so it wouldn't be arranged in such a short time." The wall newspaper and comics group that cooperated with the middle school Yangko team received as many as seventy-seven contributors, and ninety-eight works were received. Some cartoonists, such as Xue Zangmei, painted seven in one go. These creations are indeed very amazing achievements.
    3. The performance of this Yangko team played a leading role in the cultural and entertainment work of the suburbs of Handan. Although the rural cultural and entertainment in the suburbs of the city was temporarily active during the lunar new year, they were all unreformed old forms and old content, such as each class needing a "Yanggu magistrate" and someone carrying a "chamber pot." What about the content? "Flirting" is a common phenomenon, and some stories are feudal superstitious stories such as "Tang Monk's Journey to the West" and "Xu Xian's Tour of the Lake." Especially today, when the so-called "masses turn over and sing and enjoy themselves" rural cultural and entertainment work has not been properly carried out, this point further illustrates the greatness of the effect of the Yangko team's performance. After the Yangko team performed, the Citizens' Association of Xinan Village said: "We will also perform it later, and we must have new ones." On the 5th and 6th, many rural primary school teachers ran to the education section to ask, "Call us to perform too." This all shows the influence given to the broad masses.

　　“七七”宣传周与秧歌队
    萧方
    “七七”宣传周在邯郸市，不仅表现了工作上的普遍性，而且是深入到各个角落里去，从工农市民到店员商人，只要是有组织的群众，除了都参加过七月三号两万人的反内战大会外，每个组织的成员，起码都讨论过一次“今年纪念七七要反对内战”。他们不仅是讨论，而且变成了实际行动，北街市民会的张尚，不仅向他街里群众宣传，还跑到车站区去到处给群众解释，就连一般轻易不关心时事的妇女，这次的工作也深入到她们中间去了，东门里的妇女小组在讨论中，普遍认识到“我们要和平，老蒋就偏要打内战，自己打还不算，还要勾结美国的坏蛋。”第二完小的一个小学生，听了老师时事报告后，说：老蒋自己坏不算，还要认个美国干爹”。蔚庄在街上跑的三个小孩子，问他谁在打内战，他们都很爽快的回答：“是老蒋”！“老蒋要真是打内战，咱们就组织起来给他干。”这更是邯郸市群众中比较普遍的吼声。
    “七七”宣传周的过程中，特别使人注目的、是中学及两个完小的大秧歌队，它所以被人们注目，是这样大规模的秧歌队在本市出演还是初次，但更重要的，是他们的化装、表演的技术及内容，确实做到了能把群众吸引住。
    参加秧歌队的人，三个学校共一百六十七人，若连配合秧歌队的讲演组、绘画组、壁报组等都计算在内，人数就达三百九十三人，几占学校全体人数百分之七八十以上。这些人都是自动参加的，情绪特别高。当中学作了号召以后，就自动报名了八十多人，当时我们以为人数太多，恐表演不好，于是挑下来几个，但被挑来的人说：“咱不行，技术不够，人家不叫咱参加！”结果，有些人在出演时临时又挤到大队里去。刘允绮在出演时，不仅严肃的精神贯注，给中学秧歌队起了模范的带头作用，而且后两次都是带病出演，李永善也同样表现着模范的姿态，并利用空闲时间，完成了自己的画报任务，一二完小的小同学苏英、王晓池等，几天来，在炎热的阳光下表演，从没有说过累和带出疲倦的样子。
    只经过两三天的筹备和排演，在三号的早饭后，第一完小的秧歌队就出演在街头，接着五、六、七、八号，中校及第二完小的秧歌队，先后走遍了市区及市周围的部分乡村，据不完全的统计，二完小秧歌队所吸引的观众有五千四百人，中学的约五千二百余，一完小虽无较确数字，但出演五次，十四个场子里，每场观众少者七八百，多者两三千，就连城郊的小村郝庄，也吸引出二百多。
    秧歌队出演在街头，只要看过它的人，没有一个群众说他演的不好，你假使也站在群众中去看，就会听到不断的掌声及不住的点头称“是”！中学在演街头剧《逃荒》时，一个老头就感动的流出泪来，好多群众给了我们秧歌队这样的批判：“比大戏唱的还好！”
    由于这次秧歌队等等的出演，给了我一些新的印象和感触：
    一、过去所谓：“歌曲”，“戏剧”，有些人认为是学校内的娱乐活动！甚至还认为这是资产阶级吃饭后优闲的生活点缀，特别是在新解放区就更是这样。但这次大秧歌队出演在街头后，这个印象转变了，特别是学校的教职员和学生，都认为这是社会宣传工作很好的武器，并认为这样到群众中去活动，也是很重要的学习内容之一。每个秧歌队都是自己编排、自己演，发现了缺点再修改再排演，但内中都有这样一个基本观点，不管内容与形式，都以群众能接受为目的，群众提出意见后，就毫不犹疑的去修改。
    二、这次秧歌队等的出演，表现了广大群众（学校的教职员及学生）创作力量的伟大。第一完小从开始编歌曲学扭与逐渐改造，三天内就有很像样的秧歌队在街上出现，大众艺术研究会（是过去旧书班改造的）反对内战的鼓词，一天内就学会，第二天就在两三千人的广场上和群众见面，演出时，周围的掌声，时常把鼓词压的听不清楚。二完小的创造更有他的突出性，秧歌夹着四个新鲜的歌曲及干板，都是自己创造的，是在每次出演时秧歌队的行列前，有高杆挑着的伟人像，有自己创作的画片，有各色各样的标语，这对秧歌队的出演增色不少。中学秧歌队伟大的行列不用说，就是几个街头剧从编词排演到出场，时间也不过三天，一个参加过宣传队的同学这样说：“在宣传队时，有现成的剧本，就不会这样短的时间排出来”。配合中学秧歌队的壁报及漫画组，光投稿者就达七十七人，作品收到九十八篇，还有的漫画组薛臧梅，一气就画了七张。这些创作，确乎都是很惊人的成绩。
    三、这次秧歌队的出演，给邯郸近郊乡村文娱工作起了个带头作用。在本市近郊虽旧历年乡村文化娱乐曾一时的活跃，但都是没有改造的旧形式与旧内容，如每班都需有一个“阳谷知县”，有一个人在挑着“夜壶”，内容呢？“吊膀子”是普遍的现象，即有些故事，也是什么“唐僧取经”“许仙游湖”等封建迷信故事，特别是这里所谓“群众翻身，自唱自乐”的乡村文化娱乐工作还没有适当的开展的今天，这一点就更说明秧歌队出演效果的伟大。秧歌队出演后，西南庄的市民会这样说：“咱们以后也演一演，保险也要新的。五六号的时候，好多乡村小学教师都跑到教育科去问“叫我们也演了吧。”这都说明了给予广大群众的影响。
