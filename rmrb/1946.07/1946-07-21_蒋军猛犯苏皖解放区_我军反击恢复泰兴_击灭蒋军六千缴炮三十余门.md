　　[This Newspaper Reports] A portion of the New Fourth Army in Central China, at the request of hundreds of thousands of people in Jingjiang and Taixing, launched a self-defense counterattack and recovered Taixing City and the important town of Xuanjiabao to its northwest on the morning of the 15th. The battle began on the night of the 13th, and after a day and two nights of fierce fighting, it concluded on the morning of the 15th. The Kuomintang army that forcibly occupied Taixing and Xuanjiabao, the 19th Division of the 100th Army (newly reorganized as the 19th Brigade of the 83rd Division), numbering approximately 6,000 men, was completely annihilated by our forces. According to incomplete statistics, the captured equipment included six mountain guns, eight direct-fire guns, twenty mortars, multiple rocket launchers, and nearly 300 light and heavy machine guns. Taixing City was liberated from the enemy puppets by the New Fourth Army on September 11th of last year, and was occupied by the Zhang Shaohua unit, a puppet traitor instigated by the Kuomintang reactionaries, on December 31st. After the ceasefire order took effect on January 13th of this year, the Kuomintang army in the city repeatedly violated the agreement and attacked, occupying approximately 40 large and small villages and towns, including Xuanjiabao and Shilibao. The people are overjoyed by the re-liberation of the city by the New Fourth Army, congratulating each other on seeing the light of day again, and are actively assisting the democratic government in rapidly restoring order.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 18th] The large-scale offensive by the Kuomintang reactionaries against the Suwan Liberated Area has been fiercely launched since the 15th. The 96th and 45th Divisions of the Kuomintang 5th Army, departing from Lai'an and Liuhe respectively, have successively occupied many of our market towns and are advancing towards Tianchang and Xuyi. The Kuomintang army distributed in the Taixing, Jingjiang, Nantong, and Haimen areas has launched an offensive against our Huangqiao, Rugao, and Dingyan line. Since the ceasefire order took effect on January 13th, the Kuomintang reactionaries have not ceased their attacks on the Suwan Liberated Area. On April 27th, they occupied Xiaoxian; on May 10th, they occupied Xiayi; on May 13th, they occupied Dingyuan; and on June 7th, they occupied Lai'an. Dozens of important market towns have been occupied. Except for Xiayi and Xiaoxian, which have been recovered by our forces, the area occupied in the fourth district west of the Huainan Jinpu Railway alone amounts to more than 24,000 square li. Wherever the Kuomintang army goes, they burn, kill, and loot everything. The authorities of the Central China Military Region have repeatedly lodged serious protests with the Nanjing Three-Man Committee, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, and the Xuzhou and Huaiyin executive groups, but to no avail. After a long period of deployment, the Chiang army has now launched a large-scale offensive. A spokesperson for the Suwan Military Region stated that they will resolutely defend themselves.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 17th] Military News: The war waged by Chiang Kai-shek's army to attack the area east of the Huainan Jinpu Railway has intensified since the 15th. The Chiang army is converging on Tianchang from Lai'an and Liuhe. The 96th Division of the Chiang army's 5th Army, attacking from Lai'an west of Tianchang, occupied Zhangshanjie and other places northeast of Lai'an on the 13th and 14th, and continued to advance in the northeast direction, occupying Zhangying, Wangying and other places on the 15th. The 45th Division of the same army, attacking from Liuhe south of Tianchang, occupied Babaiqiao, an important place northeast of Liuhe leading to Tianchang, on the 15th, and violently attacked northward, occupying Jinniushan, Fanjiaj, Wangjiashan and other places on the 16th. In addition, the Chiang army attacking Xuyi from Jiashan on the Jinpu Railway reoccupied Shipu north of Jiashan on the 16th, which was recovered by our army on the 12th.

    【本报讯】华中新四军一部，应靖江、泰兴数十万人民之请，举行自卫反击，于十五日晨收复泰兴城及其西北之重镇宣家堡。战斗自十三日夜开始，经一晨两夜激战，至十五日晨已告结束。强占我泰兴、宣家堡两地之国民党军为一百军十九师（新编为八十三师十九旅）约六千余人，全部被我击灭，据不完全统计，缴获山炮六门，平射炮八门，迫击炮二十门，火箭炮多门，轻重机枪近三百挺。按泰兴城系新四军于去年九月十一日从敌伪手中解放，十二月三十一日为国民党反动派指使伪逆张少华部所侵占。今年一月十三日停战令生效后，该城国民党军又一再违约出犯，先后占我宣家堡、十里甸等大小村镇约四十处。此次该城为新四军再度解放，人民欢喜若狂，相祝重见天日，现正积极协助民主政府迅速恢复秩序中。
