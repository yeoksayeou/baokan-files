　　Our Army Liberates Fanshi and Daixian
　　Yan's Puppet Troops Along the Datong-Puzhou and Zhengtai Railways Launch Attacks
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 10th – The cities of Fanshi and Daixian, located at the foot of the Wutai Mountains in northwestern Shanxi, have been liberated by the Hebei-Shanxi Eighth Route Army. Local people are assisting the local democratic government in restoration work. The puppet security team stationed in Fanshi, after being reorganized by Yan Xishan into the Fourth Division of the Provincial Defense Army, repeatedly launched harassment operations, resulting in a desolate landscape within thirty miles of the city. The masses, unable to bear the suffering, have repeatedly requested the Eighth Route Army to rescue them. On the 3rd of this month, the Hebei-Shanxi Eighth Route Army was ordered to proceed and, after six hours of fierce fighting, liberated the city. In this battle, over 600 puppet officers and soldiers were killed or captured, more than 41 light machine guns and 500 rifles were seized, and the notorious traitor Gong Bingwen, puppet army commander and deputy commander-in-chief of the joint defense, was killed. After the liberation of Fanshi, the Yan puppet troops in Daixian were frightened and fled towards Yuanping. The Eighth Route Army, amidst the welcome of the people of Daixian, entered Daixian city.
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 10th – The Second Military Sub-district Command of the Hebei-Shanxi Military Region recently issued a statement saying that in recent months, Yan Xishan has mobilized his 83rd Division, 37th Division, 71st Division, etc., in conjunction with puppet troops from Wutai and other places, and Japanese troops along the Datong-Puzhou and Zhengtai Railways, to launch over 440 harassing attacks on the liberated areas of northeastern Shanxi, occupying over 400 villages and towns. The military and civilians of the liberated areas have shown great restraint, but Yan Xishan on the 7th of last month mobilized his 46th, 71st and other divisions to attack the liberated areas of Yangqu, Yuci, Shouyang, and Mengxian. Our army has repeatedly called on the Yan army to stop the attacks and repeatedly telegraphed the Taiyuan Executive Headquarters to stop them, but to no avail. Therefore, our army has been forced to take appropriate self-defense measures. If the Yan army does not immediately stop the attacks and withdraw from the occupied villages, the situation will escalate, and the consequences should be borne by the Yan side.
    Our newspaper, Yangcheng, 9th – More than 2,000 Yan puppet troops are fiercely attacking our Pingyao liberated area. At 11:00 AM on the 5th, more than 500 Yan puppet troops from the 9th Column were transferred from Yuci to Pingyao. After disembarking from the train, they coordinated with a part of the 3rd Regiment of Yan's 37th Division, numbering over 400, stationed in Pingyao, and, armed with three mortars, invaded our Chengnanbu, Jiukang, and Xiaocheng villages. Later, they launched two more attacks on our Gaolin and Yinhui areas. Our army resolutely counterattacked, and after fierce fighting until the evening, the Yan army was driven back to Chengnanbu, Xiaocheng, Jiukang, and other villages. On the 6th, more than 1,000 Yan puppet reinforcements arrived from Yuci and Fenyang, secretly gathering around Xiaocheng in preparation for another attack. On the same day, over 100 Zhang and Yan puppet troops from Jiexiu, in coordination with the Yan army's attack on Pingyao, also attacked our Litun in Jiexiu, but were repelled by us. At dawn on the 7th, the Yan puppet allied forces, totaling over 2,500, launched another large-scale attack on our Pingyao liberated area, capturing our Gaolin, Yinhui, Liji, Yuebi, and other places. At 9:00 PM that night, after the Yan army continued to occupy Beicun, where the Pingyao Democratic County Government was located in Dongquan Town, they carried out large-scale arrests and killings of local people and used artillery to bombard nearby villages. On the 8th, the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Yan's 45th Division was also transferred to Pingyao to attack us. The military and civilians of the county have bravely defended themselves. For several days, local militias have been rushing to the self-defense front lines, and the people of the whole county are also fully supporting our army in the front-line self-defense operations to protect their peaceful homes.
    Our newspaper, Heze, 9th – (Delayed) A company of Chiang's troops stationed at Laoqing'an north of Xinxiang City, and a squad of Chiang's troops guarding Xinxiang Airport, attacked our troops stationed in Bubi and other places in Xinxiang on the 21st of last month. Our army resolutely defended itself and counterattacked, and all the invading troops laid down their arms.

    【新华社阜平十日电】晋西北五台山麓之繁峙、代县两城，已为冀晋八路军解放，当地人民正帮助地方民主政府进行恢复工作。驻繁峙之伪保安队，自被阎锡山改编为省防军第四师后，多次出动骚扰，现城郊三十余里境内尽成荒凉世界。群众不堪其苦，纷纷要求八路军解救。本月三日，冀晋八路军应命前往，经六小时激战后，解放该城。是役毙俘伪官兵六百余，缴轻机枪四十一挺，步枪五百余支，伪军长兼联防副总指挥著名汉奸宫炳文被击毙。繁峙解放后，代县阎伪军惊骇向崞县逃逸，八路军遂在代县人民欢迎下，进驻代县城。

    【本报荷泽九日电】（迟到）驻防新乡城北老清庵之蒋军一个连，及新乡机场蒋军卫兵一个班，于上月二十一日，分路向我新乡卜壁等地驻军进犯，我军坚决自卫反击，进犯军全部放下武器。
