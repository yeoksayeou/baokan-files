Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, July 11th: Following the recovery of Fanshi and Daixian, the Eighth Route Army of Ji-Jin crushed the resistance of the puppet army on the 6th, liberating Yangmingbao and Banzhengpu Town, ten miles south of it, where they were entrenched. Yangmingbao is a well-known anti-Japanese battlefield in northern Shanxi. In the autumn of 1938, the 129th Division of the Eighth Route Army burned 24 Japanese planes at this highway junction. In the following years, the Jin-Cha-Ji Eighth Route Army frequently operated around it, effectively resisting the enemy. After the Japanese surrender, the area was occupied by the puppet army appointed by Yan Xishan.

Xinhua News Agency, Rugao, July 10th: Approximately 1,000 Kuomintang troops stationed in Jingjiang and Taixing, in conjunction with the "Armed Home Return Corps," fiercely attacked Huangqiao, a vital town between Ru(gao), Jing(jiang), and Tai(xing) in the Suwan Liberated Area last month, dividing into three routes. One route of more than 600 men advanced from Taixing to Simadun, 20 miles west of Huangqiao, on the 26th of last month. Another route of more than 300 men advanced from Xuanjiabao (30 miles north of Taixing) to Baimao Duo, 25 miles northwest of Huangqiao. A third route of more than 100 men advanced from Jingjiang to Maqiao, seven miles north of the city, on the morning of the 27th. After the Taixing route occupied Simadun, they divided into two routes again on the morning of the 27th and fiercely attacked Huangqiao, rushing to Huangjia ×, more than ten miles away from Huangqiao. We were forced to defend ourselves. With the assistance of over ten thousand local people, we completely defeated the invading army and two companies of their reinforcements. The remaining troops retreated to Shili Dian (ten miles east of Taixing). In this battle, over 100 invading soldiers were killed or wounded, over ten were captured, and six light machine guns, over 50 rifles, one grenade launcher, two boxes of American-made rocket shells, and two Thompson submachine guns were seized. The other two routes were also driven back by the army and people of the Liberated Area.

    【新华社阜平十一日电】冀晋八路军，继收复繁峙、代县等地后，于六日粉碎伪军抵抗，解放其所盘踞的阳明堡及其南十里之班政铺镇。按阳明堡系山西北部著名抗日战场，八路军一二九师于一九三八年秋，曾在这一公路连结点内焚毁日寇飞机二十四架。在以后数年中，晋察冀八路军经常在其周围活动，有力的抗击敌人。日寇投降后，该地即被阎锡山加委之伪军所盘踞。
