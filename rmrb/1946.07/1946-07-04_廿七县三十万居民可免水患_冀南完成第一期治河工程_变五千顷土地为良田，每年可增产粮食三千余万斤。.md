[Report from our Weixian correspondent] Before the War of Resistance, the rivers in our Southern Hebei region were neglected for years under the rule of the Kuomintang government. Coupled with the destruction by the enemy and puppets over the past eight years, the riverbeds were completely silted up. Every rainy season, mountain torrents would erupt and cause floods. During this year's Great Production Movement, in order to prevent floods and increase income, our Southern Hebei Administrative Office specially formulated a river management plan, assigning specific tasks based on the river system, and allocated 3,550 tons of grain and 3,000,000 currency units for river management expenses. Before the wheat harvest, the people of 27 counties including Gucheng, Longping, Cixian, Weixian, Daming, Jize, Renxian, Wuyi, Yongnian, Ningnan, Zaoqiang, Pingxiang, Xinhe, Weixian and Guantao, victoriously completed the first phase of the river management plan. A total of 121,488 meters of river embankment were repaired, 16,759 meters of canals were dug, and three bridges were built, using a total of 2,565,775 workdays. More than 1,000 villages and more than 300,000 residents can avoid floods. 33,400 hectares of land have been transformed into fertile fields. Calculating an average increase of 25 kilograms per 667 sq meters, the annual increase in food production will be 12,670 tons. 37,400 hectares of land can be irrigated, with an average increase of 5 kilograms per 667 sq meters, resulting in an additional 2,805 tons. This tremendous achievement has excited the masses throughout the region. They happily say, "When the Kuomintang was in power, they didn't care if we drowned. Now that the Communist Party has come, they have created such great benefits for us. With the Communist Party here, we will never be afraid of floods again!" At the urgent request of the masses, preparations are already underway in various places for the second phase of river management after the wheat harvest.
