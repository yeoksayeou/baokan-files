Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 1st: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 30th, the spokesperson for the CCP delegation issued a written statement at 8:00 PM today, stating in brief: Long-term ceasefire and comprehensive ceasefire have always been our consistent propositions. Unfortunately, they have not been agreed to by the government authorities, leading to the current abrupt and uneasy situation. During the eight-day extension of the ceasefire, general agreements have been reached on issues such as completely stopping conflicts in the Northeast, restoring transportation, and resolving certain disputes within the Executive Headquarters and its groups. The revised articles of the military reorganization plan, through the efforts of General Marshall, the enthusiastic mediation of the third party, and the CCP's greatest concessions, could have achieved a preliminary agreement. However, due to the government's insistence on unreasonable demands, the agreement was not reached. We express great regret over this. The announcement made today by Mr. Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang, is very peculiar in form. On the one hand, it declares that the Central Army will not take military action against the Communist Army, but it does not state whether the government has issued this order, and especially does not state whether this state of ceasefire is long-term or short-term. But in any case, the CCP insists on its position of peace and opposition to civil war, and is still willing to continue negotiations under the auspices of General Marshall to seek a political solution. Furthermore, a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 30th reported that the CCP delegation held a press conference at 8:00 PM today. Zhou Enlai responded to reporters, stating: We agreed that some local troops could be moved during the military reorganization, but the government was not satisfied with this and wanted the CCP to withdraw troops and administrations from areas such as Northern Jiangsu and Jehol, which we cannot consider or accept. He continued, referring to the compromise proposal put forward by Marshal Marshall, stating that the CCP agreed to the vast majority and the most important parts of it. He also said that future continued negotiations will adopt the form of a three-person meeting and off-site discussions. Zhou denied the rumors that the Communist Army would withdraw from Northern Jiangsu and declared that the Communist Army has no intention of attacking Datong.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 1st: According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing: On June 30th, Kuomintang Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei issued a statement stating in brief: "The government still requests General Marshall to continue mediation, hoping to achieve a peaceful resolution to the 'Agreement on the Implementation Plan for Military Reorganization and the Designation of Garrison Areas'" (Note: referring to the unreasonable demands made by the Kuomintang authorities during the eight-day negotiations, that the CCP must withdraw from the nine northeastern provinces, Chahar, Suiyuan, Northern Jiangsu, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway) "must be established within a time limit." "If such a problem is not concretely resolved, then all other agreements cannot be effectively implemented, especially if the garrison areas of the troops are not designated, conflicts cannot be avoided." Peng's statement "will not take military action against the Communist Army," but at the same time falsely accused: "The Communist Party is attacking the National Army," "which cannot but be resisted and driven away." At a time when the national anti-civil war movement is flourishing, the Kuomintang authorities have to issue this statement to conceal their civil war intentions and pretend to be "seeking a political solution." However, in practical actions, the Kuomintang authorities are actively expanding the civil war. For example, the Kuomintang's war to encircle and annihilate the Central Plains CCP troops has already begun. In Shandong, the Kuomintang army has occupied the Longshan Station in Qingzhou and is continuing its fierce attacks. Yan Xishan's army in Shanxi has also occupied Sunyizhen. The Kuomintang army's large-scale offensive deployment against the liberated areas such as Northern Jiangsu is also complete. And Peng Xuepei's statement, which contains pretexts for expanding the civil war, deserves serious vigilance.

　　中共代表团发言人声明
    中共仍持和平谈判立场
    彭学沛掩饰国民党内战企图
    【新华社延安一日电】据中央社南京三十日电：中共代表团发言人，今日下午八时发表书面谈话，略称：长期停战、全面停战原为吾人之一贯之主张，不幸未获政府当局同意，致形成目前突兀不安之局面。在延期休战八天中，关于完全停止东北冲突，恢复交通及解决执行部与小组中某些争议等问题，均已获得一般协议，而整军方案修正条款，经马歇尔将军努力，第三方面的热心奔走，与中共方面最大的让步，本可完成初步协议，唯因政府方面坚持无理要求，致协议未成，吾人对此表示甚大遗憾。今日国民党中宣部长彭学沛先生所宣布的公告，其形式甚为特别，一方面声明中央军不对共军采取军事行动，但并未说明政府方面是否已曾发布此项命令，尤其未说明此种休战状态是长期抑是短期。但不管怎样，中共方面仍坚持和平反对内战的立场，仍愿在马歇尔将军赞助之下继续商谈，求得政治解决。又中央社南京三十日电：中共代表团今日下午八时举行记者招待会，周恩来答复记者称：吾人答应在整军时，某些地方军队可以调开，但政府不以此为满足，而欲中共撤出苏北、热河等地军队及政权，吾人实无法考虑与接受。渠继述及马帅所提折衷方案称：中共对其中极大部分及极重要部分均同意。渠并谓：今后继续商谈时，将采用三人会议及会外商谈的方式。周氏否认外传共军将撤出苏北之说，并声明共军无向大同进攻企图。
    【新华社延安一日电】据中央社南京电：六月三十日国民党宣传部长彭学沛发表声明略称：“政府仍请马歇尔将军继续调解，期得和平解决“整军实施方案与指定驻军地区之协定”（按指在八天谈判中，国民党当局提出中共得退出东北九省，察、绥、苏北、烟台、威海卫，及津浦路沿线等地的无理要求）得“限期成立”。“如此一问题不获具体解决，则其他各种协定皆不能作有效之实施，尤其军队驻地如不指定，冲突仍无法避免”。彭氏声明“不对共军采取军事行动”，但同时又诬称：“共党进攻国军”，“不能不加以抵抗与驱逐”。在全国人民反内战运动蓬勃开展之时，国民党当局不得不发表这一周声明，掩饰他们的内战企图，装着“要政治解决”的姿态。但国民党当局在实际行动上，正在积极扩大内战，例如国民党围歼中原中共部队的战争已经开始，在山东方面，国民党军侵占青州龙山车站，并仍在继续猛犯。山西阎军亦侵占孙义镇。对苏北等地解放区，国民党军大举进攻之部署亦已完竣。而彭学沛声明中，包含着扩大内战的借口，更值得严重警惕。
