　　【Our Yangcheng Correspondent, 15th】The Taiyue District Middle School Education Conference has sent a message to the national education community, calling on everyone to rise up and fight to the end to inherit Li Gongpu's legacy. The original telegram roughly stated: At a time when the people of the whole country are demanding independence, peace, and democracy, the fascist faction within the Kuomintang is adhering to its policy of civil war, dictatorship, and national betrayal, and has resorted to shameless means of terrorist suppression, brutally murdering Mr. Li Gongpu, an advanced democratic fighter in our education community. Overcome with grief and indignation, our colleagues hereby call on the national education community to rise up together, inherit Mr. Gongpu's legacy, and fight to the end against civil war, dictatorship, and American armed intervention in China's internal affairs.
    Another telegram: The Taiyue District Middle School Education Conference sends a condolence message to Mr. Li Gongpu's family: To Madam Zhang Manyun: We are shocked to learn that Mr. Gongpu was shot and killed by Kuomintang secret agents. The masses are filled with grief and indignation. For decades, Mr. Li dedicated himself to education, working tirelessly for the War of Resistance and for democracy, contributing greatly to the country. Though dead, he lives on. We hope you will restrain your grief and carry on his will to comfort his spirit. Respectfully, the Taiyue District Middle School Education Conference.
