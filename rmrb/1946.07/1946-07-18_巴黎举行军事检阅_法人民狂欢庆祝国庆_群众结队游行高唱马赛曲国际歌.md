　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Paris dispatch: Yesterday (July 14th), the jubilant masses of France celebrated their National Day – the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. Yesterday morning, a military parade was held in Paris, and grand dances took place in the streets and public places, continuing until midnight. Allied flags were hung all over the streets. The Vietnamese delegation also stood alongside French ministers and Prime Minister Bidault on the reviewing stand at the site of the Bastille. During the parade, artillery vehicles and radar vehicles garnered thunderous applause from the audience. Two thousand two hundred workers from munitions factories, breaking with past traditions, participated in the parade wearing ordinary blue work clothes with their sleeves rolled up, and were also warmly welcomed by the masses. In the afternoon of the 14th, Parisians marched in droves from the Place de la Bastille to the Place de la République, lasting four hours. Socialists and Communists led the way, followed by a dense crowd, singing the Marseillaise and The Internationale. Among them were workers, athletes, and teachers. A rainstorm drove the crowd into the arcades and the officials off the reviewing stand. Similar parades were held throughout France. It is noted that on July 14, 1789, revolutionary insurgents in Paris rose up at the Bastille, broke out of prison, signaling the outbreak of the French Revolution. This revolution overthrew the feudal empire and established the French Democratic Republic. July 14th was designated as French National Day.

　　巴黎举行军事检阅
    法人民狂欢庆祝国庆
    群众结队游行高唱马赛曲国际歌
    【新华社延安十五日电】巴黎讯：昨日（七月十四日），欢欣鼓舞的广大法国群众庆祝国庆——攻占巴斯底狱的纪念日。昨晨巴黎举行了军事检阅，街道中及公共场所均有盛大之舞会，直至午夜始停。街道上遍悬盟国国旗。越南代表团亦在巴斯底狱原址之农场检阅台上，立于法国各部长及比道尔总理之傍。检阅中，炮车与雷达车博得了观众的雷动掌声。军火工厂工人二千二百名，打破过去的传统，身穿平常的蓝色工人装，卷起袖子参加游行，亦受到群众之热烈欢迎。十四日下午巴黎人成群结队由巴斯底场游行至共和国广场，历时四点钟，社会党与共产党人士率先行进，他们后面跟着黑压压的人群，高唱马赛歌、国际歌，其中有工人，运动员、教员等，直至一阵暴雨，把人群赶至廊庑，把官员们赶下检阅台为止。法国全国各地均举行了这样的游行。按一七八九年七月十四日巴黎巴斯底狱的革命党人起义，破狱而出，是为法国大革命爆发的信号。这一革命推翻了封建帝制，成立了法兰西民主共和国。七月十四日乃定为法国国庆日。
