(Our newspaper, Heze dispatch) The Fourth Military District of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region has summarized the following experiences in the continuous self-defense struggle against the nibbling and encroachment of Chiang's and puppet troops: In the past few months of self-defense struggle in the region, due to the active activities, mutual assistance and cooperation of armed forces at all levels, and the resolute attack on invaders, the armed forces at all levels supported each other, and the good combination of each other, not only achieved great victories, but also strengthened our self-defense armed forces. The Anyang Brigade has repeatedly and victoriously repelled the attacks of Chiang's and puppet troops on our Chu Wang area, and inflicted serious blows on the Kuomintang Security Brigade and the puppet Neihuang Brigade, which were several times larger than us, achieving great victories with small casualties. The 3rd District Team of Junxian County, in conjunction with the local militia, fought fiercely with 600 invading Chiang's and puppet troops for half a day and repelled them. The 4th District Team and the militia also fought fiercely with a battalion of Chiang's troops for several hours, and finally broke out of the encirclement and defeated the stubborn troops. These heroic combat achievements have been rewarded by the sub-district and warmly supported and comforted by the people. The district's experience points out that: First of all, we should continue to examine and summarize the experience of the self-defense struggle, find the reasons for success and failure, and carry out mass ideological education to improve the combat will and self-defense struggle determination of all the military and civilians. Second, establish a garrison zone for organizing the struggle against puppets and stubborn elements, with counties, districts or villages as units, establish certain self-defense organizations, give them certain tasks, and establish certain relationships between the militia self-defense teams, county and district armed forces, and seek mutual combination to create a mass struggle against puppets and stubborn elements. Third, in terms of activity mode, irregular guerrilla activities should be adopted. Fourth, enforce strict discipline and implement a reward and punishment system for self-defense struggle from top to bottom.

　　冀鲁豫四分区军民结合
    打退蒋伪军蚕食进攻
    主要经验是各级武装互助合作
    造成群众性的对顽伪斗争
    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫四分区我军与地方武装，在不断反对蒋伪军蚕食侵犯的自卫斗争中，已总结出如下的经验：该区过去数月的自卫斗争中，由于各级武装的积极活动互助合作，坚决打击进犯者，各级武装相互撑腰，互相结合作得好，结果不但取得了很大胜利，而且我自卫武装也愈战愈强。安阳大队曾数次胜利击退蒋伪军向我楚旺一带之进攻，并给数倍于我之国民党保安旅及伪内黄大队以严重打击，以小的伤亡，获得了大的胜利。浚县三区队结合当地民兵，与六百进犯之蒋伪军激战半日，将其击退。四区队和民兵，亦与蒋军一个营激战数小时，最后仍冲出包围，将顽军击溃。这种英勇作战的成绩，得到了分区的奖励和人民热烈的拥护与慰劳。该区经验指出：今后首先应继续检查总结自卫斗争的经验，寻找成功与失败的原因，展开群众性的思想教育，以提高全体军民的战斗意志和自卫斗争的决心。第二，建立组织对伪顽斗争的警备地带，以县区或一片村庄为单位，建立一定的自卫组织，给予一定的任务，使民兵自卫队县区武装，建立一定的关系，求得互相结合、造成群众性的对伪顽的斗争。第三，在活动方式上，应采取不规律的游击性的活动。第四，严明纪律，从上而下的实行自卫斗争的奖惩制度。
