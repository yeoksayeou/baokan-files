　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: Shanghai report: Since last month, a major crisis has occurred in the unified public bond market here. The reason is that for the past ten months, speculative officials and bureaucratic merchants have been systematically spreading rumors about preferential redemption of pre-war public bonds, causing the market price of unified public bonds to far exceed their face value. On the 19th of last month, Soong Tzu-wen suddenly announced that the authorities had decided to repay pre-war public bonds at face value, resulting in a sharp decline in public bonds across the board. This unified public bond fell from 5,900 yuan (on the 10th of last month) to 800 yuan (on the 22nd). This caused a great shock, resulting in the bankruptcy of the original buyers, with losses amounting to 17 million yuan. More than a dozen speculative securities firms went bankrupt due to empty pockets, and banks and money shops such as Daya, Zhejiang, and Jianye went bankrupt as a result, and the market's silver supply became extremely tight. On July 3rd alone, the difference in clearing house exchanges reached 2.7 million yuan, plunging the financial market into chaos.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Shanghai Dagong Bao reports: Due to heavy taxes and levies, as well as heavy interest exploitation by money shops, Wuhu's shops have suffered huge losses. At the end of last month, when accounts were settled, as many as 32 businesses had reported closures, including six egg businesses, four department stores, two hardware stores, seven cloth businesses, and thirteen yarn businesses.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: According to the Beiping Yishibao of June 18th: The person in charge of the General Affairs Department of the Kuomintang Ministry of Education "once sold two-thirds of the 3,000 plane seats allocated to the ministry by the Executive Yuan on the black market, at a minimum price of 400,000 yuan per seat and a maximum of over 900,000 yuan."

　　国民党官僚通同作弊
    沪市发生公债风潮
    教育部发生巨大贪污案
    【新华社南京二十一日电】沪讯：自上月以来，此间统一公债市场发生大风潮，其原因是十个月来，官僚官商的投机家，有计划的散布战前公债优惠还本的谣言，以致统一公债的市价，远超过其票面价额。上月十九日，宋子文突然宣布当局决按票面价值偿还战前公债，结果公债一致急速下跌。此种统一公债由五千九百元（上月十日）跌到八百元（廿二日）。这一轩然大波，造成原先购户的大破产，损失数额达一千七百万万元。投机证券字号因囊空而倒闭的达十余家，银行钱庄因而倒闭的有大亚、浙江、建业等多家，市面银根奇紧。七月三日一天之中，票据交换差额竟达二百七十万万元，金融市场陷入混乱状态。
    【新华社延安二十日电】沪大公报载：芜湖各商店因为苛捐重税及钱庄子金的重利盘剥，亏蚀巨大，于上月底结账比期时，报歇之商号已有三十二家之多，计蛋业六家、百货业四家、五金业二家、布业七家及纱业十三家。
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据六月十八日北平益世报载：国民党教育部总务司负责人，“曾以行政院调配该部之飞机座位三千个的三分之二以黑市出卖，最低价每位四十万元，最高达九十万元以上”。
