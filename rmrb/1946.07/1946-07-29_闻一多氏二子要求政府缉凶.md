Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th -- Chongqing Dispatch: Nine newspapers here, including the Democratic Daily, Xinhua Daily, and Times News, simultaneously published an article on the 18th by Wen Yiduo's second son, Wen Lidiao, and third son, Wen Lipeng, entitled "July 15th Killed My Father!". The article stated: "We want to accuse the society and the people of the world, please uphold justice and demand the government immediately arrest the murderers and those behind the scenes." Wen's eldest son, Lihe, was shot at the same time as his father, suffering five bullet wounds. He is now being treated in Kunming, and Wen has passed the critical period. Lidiao and Lipeng are both students at a middle school in Chongqing. Lipeng, who is only thirteen years old, tearfully told reporters: "Dad is dead anyway, but this method is so shameless and despicable! Dad died for democracy." He also said: "Dad originally planned to come to Chongqing on the 13th to wait for a plane to Beiping. Because Chongqing was hot and there were no planes, he wrote a letter saying that it was not necessary to come early, and to wait until the 20th, but he died on the 15th." Wen has two daughters and his wife in Kunming.

　　闻一多氏二子要求政府缉凶
    【新华社延安二十四日电】渝讯：此间民主报、新华日报、时事新报等九家报纸，十八日同时发表闻一多氏之次子闻立雕、三子闻立鹏二人所作《七一五杀死了我的爸爸！》一文。文中称：“我们要向社会人士和全世界人士控诉，请主持正义，要求政府立即捕拿凶手和幕后主持者。”闻氏长子立鹤与父同时遇刺，身中五弹，现在昆明医治，闻已脱离危险期。立雕、立鹏均在渝某中学肄业，立鹏年才十三岁，他流着泪告记者说：“爸爸反正是死了，不过这种手段是多么无耻卑鄙！爸爸是为民主而死的”。又说：“爸爸原定十三日来渝，候机飞平，因重庆天热，没有飞机，所以去信说不必早来，等二十日再来，可是十五日就死了。”闻氏在昆明有二女及其夫人。
