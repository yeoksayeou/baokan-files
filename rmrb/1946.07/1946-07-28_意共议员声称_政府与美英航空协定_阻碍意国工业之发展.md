　　Italian Communist MP Claims
    Government's Aviation Agreements with US, UK
    Hinder Italian Industrial Development
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: Italian Communist Party MP and Arctic explorer General Nobile claimed on the 23rd that the Italian government's aviation agreements with the US and UK (note: the US-Italy aviation agreement was concluded in early May) hinder Italian industrial development. Nobile stated that the US-Italy aviation agreement stipulates that Italy must purchase all US equipment and machinery, and that after the US company withdraws at the end of the three-year period, Italy must repay the company for the remaining equipment and inventory in US dollars. The US-Italy joint airline is composed of six Italians and four Americans, and all resolutions must be passed by a two-thirds majority, which makes the Italian majority in the association nominal. Nobile stated that the Italian government has a similar agreement with British Airways, but it is still kept secret by the authorities. I request that these two agreements, which place Italian civil aviation in the hands of foreigners, be made public in parliament and fully discussed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 24th: Rome News: The strike by gasoline workers at all Italian airports last week ended on the 23rd. The workers' demand for wage increases has been successful.

　　意共议员声称
    政府与美英航空协定
    阻碍意国工业之发展
    【新华社延安二十四日电】意立宪议会中共产党议员，北极探险家诺比尔将军，二十三日称：意大利政府与美英之航空协定（按：美意航空协定于五月上旬缔结），阻碍意国工业之发展。诺氏称：意美航空协定，规定意大利购买美国的一切装备及机器，而在美国公司于三年期满撤退后，意大利必须以美元偿付该公司所留下之装备与存货。意美联合航空公司由意国六人及美国四人组成，一切决议必须三分之二以上的票数通过，这使该会中意大利的多数变成名义上的。诺氏称：意政府与英国航空公司亦有同样协定，但尚为当局秘而不宣。我要求将意大利民航置于外国人手中的这两个协定，在议会中公布，并加以充分讨论。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】罗马讯：上周意大利全境空运之汽油工人罢工，已于二十三日结束。工人之增资要求已获胜利。
