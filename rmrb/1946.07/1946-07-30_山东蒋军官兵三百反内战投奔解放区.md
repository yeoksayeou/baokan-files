　　Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 26th -- Some lower-ranking officers and soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek army along the Jiaoji Railway line, unwilling to be sacrificed in the civil war, have been deserting to the liberated areas with their weapons. From June 23rd to July 20th, 297 people have fled to Gaomi and other places, bringing with them four light machine guns and more than twenty rifles and pistols. The democratic government has warmly welcomed and comforted them. Those who wish to return home are given travel expenses and sent back to their villages. Xu Youyi, an upper lieutenant company commander of the Engineering Battalion of the 8th Army of the Chiang Kai-shek army, and Tang Jichen, the special affairs chief, who fled from Weixian City, said: "We firmly oppose the civil war that slaughters our own compatriots. Last year in Guangdong, we wanted to join the Dongjiang Column. Now that we have come to the Eighth Route Army, our long-cherished wish has truly been fulfilled." They also wrote letters to the officers and soldiers of the 8th Army, urging them to withdraw from the civil war and not make meaningless sacrifices for Chiang Kai-shek personally.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th -- According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on the 12th, most of the soldiers in the armored regiment stationed in Zhengzhou are educated youths who joined the army. After completing three months of training in the training regiment starting from New Year's Day in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), they went to India for the expedition to northern Burma. The Nationalist Government had then clearly stipulated that the term of service for students joining the army was two years. They returned to China after the victory, and their term had long expired, but the government broke its promise and refused to demobilize them. Now, they have organized the "Training Regiment Volunteer Student Soldiers Association" and issued an open letter to the elders and compatriots of the whole country, demanding that the government demobilize them according to the time limit so that they can go to school and find employment.

　　山东蒋军官兵三百反内战投奔解放区
    【新华社莱阳二十六日电】胶济路沿线蒋军中一部分下级官员和士兵。因不愿为内战牺牲品，纷纷携械逃入解放区。自上月二十三日至本月七月二十日内，先后逃来高密等地者达二九七人，并携来轻机枪四挺，长短枪二十余支，民主政府均予热烈欢迎与安慰，对愿回家者，则发给路费欢送其返乡。由潍县城逃来之蒋军第八军工兵营上尉连长徐有益及特务长唐集臣等称：我们坚决反对屠杀自己同胞的内战，去年在广东时，就想投奔东江纵队，现在来到八路军，真正达了到夙愿。他们并去信给第八军官兵，促其退出内战，勿为蒋介石个人作无谓牺牲。
    【新华社延安廿七日电】据十二日沪大公报载：驻郑州装甲兵团士兵，多为从军知识青年，彼等自三十三年元旦在教导团入伍受训三月期满后，开赴印度远征缅北，国民党政府当时曾经明文规定学生从军期限为二年，彼等于胜利后回国期限早满，而政府竟自食诺言，不予复员。现彼等组织“教导团自愿从军学生同学会”，发表告全国父老同胞书，要求政府依限期予以复员，以便求学就业去。
