　　[This dispatch from our Heze office on the 4th] Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops have once again invaded our Yuedong Liberated Area. On the 16th, Liu Zhi, Director of the Kuomintang Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, convened an "Encirclement and Suppression" meeting in Zhengzhou, re-allocating forces. The Kuomintang 81st Brigade of Qi County was the main force, equipped with ten tanks and forty vehicles, leading two regiments of Zhang Lanfeng's puppet troops. They were organized into a pursuit force, while security regiments from fifteen other counties acted as garrison troops, awaiting orders to move out. On the 21st, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from Qi County launched a fierce attack on our area in two routes. One route, equipped with five tanks and three vehicles, advanced towards Shiyuan and Miaozhai north of Qi County, attempting to eliminate our Qi County Brigade. The other route, equipped with four tanks, advanced towards Sisoulou west of Qi County. They were attacked by our Tongxu Brigade north of the village and retreated back into the city. On the same day, over two hundred Kuomintang Fugou Security Regiment and Yanling Security Brigade troops, who had occupied Changtan in Fugou, were resolutely countered by our army. On the 22nd, Changtan was recaptured, and all invading troops were defeated, with over seventy captured alive, and three machine guns and over ninety rifles seized. On the 23rd, puppet Zhang Lanfeng, again with four battalions commanded by Wang Kangde, accompanied by three mountain guns, ten heavy machine guns, and over a hundred cavalry, fiercely attacked our Qi County and Taikang areas, occupying important villages and towns such as Weizhen and Banmuji in Qi County, and Gaoxianji in Taikang, and extensively building bunkers and fortifications. Wang Le in northwest Taikang was also occupied by Zhang Zhengyou's puppet troops on the same day. Currently, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops are engaged in fierce fighting with our heroic Yuedong soldiers and civilians who are counter-attacking.
    [This dispatch from our Handan office on the 6th] On June 30th, Yan's puppet troops concentrated six regiments and launched an attack on our Second Military Subdistrict of Taihang east of Yuci and Taigu in four routes. The first route, the third regiment of puppet Zhao Rui, departed from Yuci City and attacked Beitianzhen and Zhanghu northeast of Yuci. After occupying these locations, they further occupied Fancun and other places. The second route consisted of the first regiment of the 46th Division and the third regiment of the 49th Division, departing from Dongyangzhen in Taigu. The third route consisted of one battalion of the 42nd Division and the Political Guard Battalion, and the Self-Defense Brigade, departing from Beiyang in Taigu, occupying Xiaobaicun after passing through Shangzhuang, and then further occupying Donglizhuang with small units. The fourth route consisted of the first regiment of the 44th Division, departing from Taigu City, occupying Huima and Shangxialinmuzhuang after passing through Xincun. After resolutely engaging in self-defense battles in Shangxialinmuzhuang, Huima, Xiaobaicun, and other places, Yan's puppet troops were forced to concentrate in six major villages and towns including Beitianzhen, Zhanghu, Gezitou, Xiaobai, and Yangyizhen, frantically looting grain, attempting to invade again.
