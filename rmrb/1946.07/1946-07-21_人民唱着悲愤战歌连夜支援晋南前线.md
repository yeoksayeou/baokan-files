　　【Benbao Yangcheng Eighteenth Electric】"Where the enemy attacks, eliminate them there." The people of the entire Taiyue region are singing this song with sorrow and anger, supporting the Jinan self-defense front from various towns and villages day and night. On the evening of the 7th, after the liberated peasants of Zhengbi Village in Yicheng heard that Chiang's troops had perfidiously attacked Jinan, the entire village was too angry to sleep. That night, the village held an emergency meeting and spontaneously organized 70 stretchers, which rushed to the front the next morning. The masses of Yicheng, Jiang County, Quwo, Qingshui and other counties who first went to the front supported the front with 1,050 stretchers in one go. In Yicheng County alone, more than 30,000 people and more than 3,000 carts spontaneously transported grain and ammunition. The militia of various counties also picked up their weapons again and rushed to the front. Women and children are nervously undertaking rear service work, collecting various comfort items to comfort the heroic self-defense Eighth Route Army soldiers on the front line.

　　人民唱着悲愤战歌连夜支援晋南前线
    【本报阳城十八日电】“敌人从那里进攻，把它消灭在那里”。太岳全区人民正悲愤的唱着这首歌子，从各乡镇连夜支援晋南自卫前线。七日晚，翼城郑壁村翻身农民听到蒋军背信进攻晋南后，全村都气愤得不能入睡，当晚该村即举行了紧急会议，自动组织担架七十付，翌晨即赶赴前线。最先走上前线的翼城、绛县、曲沃、沁水等县群众，一次即支援前线担架一千零五十付，自动运送粮食弹药的群众仅翼城一县，即达三万余人，大车三千余辆。各县民兵，亦全部重新拿起武器，纷纷开赴前线。妇女儿童们紧张的担负了后方勤务工作，并收集各种慰劳品，慰劳前线英勇自卫的八路军战士。
