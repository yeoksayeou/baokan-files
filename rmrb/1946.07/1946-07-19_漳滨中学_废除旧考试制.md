　　Zhangbin Middle School
    Abolishes the Old Examination System
    In order to reform the learning atmosphere and cultivate students' self-awareness and self-governance capabilities, Zhangbin Middle School abolished the old examination system and adopted a method of self-summary and mass assessment. The assessment method is that individuals make summaries of all aspects, which are evaluated by the group, passed by the whole class, reviewed by the subject teachers and grade teachers, and finally determined by the Dean of Studies; the focus of the assessment is on the individual and the group, and the main spirit is that individuals are responsible for themselves. Each student is issued a student record book, which serves as a summary of academic performance and ideological training, such as views on the Eighth Route Army and the Kuomintang Army, who is for the people? How to see strength? Who do landlords and farmers depend on for their livelihood, etc. The second is the examination of learning attitude (learning purpose, method, mutual assistance spirit, extracurricular activities, etc.) and life cultivation (whether consciously abide by the system, labor concept and performance, collective life, spirit of criticism and self-criticism, etc.). This is a new assessment method with an experimental nature. After research by all faculty members, it was conveyed at the mobilization meeting for the assessment of all students before the summer vacation. Many students reflected after the meeting: "This method is good; in the past, the teacher gave the score, now it is determined by ourselves and the students. In the past, the exam could be faked, but now it cannot be faked. It all depends on the usual efforts."

　　漳滨中学
    废除旧考试制
    漳滨中学为了改造学风，养成学员自觉自治能力，废除了旧的考试制度，采用自我总结群众性的考核办法。考核的办法是个人作出各方面的总结，经小组评定，全班通过，科任教员及级任教员审核，最后由教导处确定；考核重点放在个人及小组，主要精神是自己对自己负责。每个学员制发一个学籍簿，作学业成绩及思想意识锻炼纪要，如对八路军与国民党军的看法，谁为人民？如何看力量？地主与农民谁靠谁生活等。其次是学习态度（学习目的、方法、互助精神、课外活动等），生活修养（是否自觉遵守制度、劳动观念及表现、集体生活、批评与自我批评精神等）的检查。这是个带实验性的新的考核方法，全体教职员研究后，于暑假前在全体学员考核动员大会上做了传达，许多同学会后反映：“这个办法好；以前是先生给定分数，现在是自己和同学定分数了，以前的考试能做假，现在不能做假了，这全看平时的努力。”
