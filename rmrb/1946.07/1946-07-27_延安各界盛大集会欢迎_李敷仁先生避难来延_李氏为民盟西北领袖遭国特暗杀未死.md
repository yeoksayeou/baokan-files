　　【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th】 Mr. Li Furen, a famous educator, folklorist, and one of the main leaders of the China Democratic League's Northwest General Branch, who was assassinated by secret agents in Xianyang but survived thanks to the enthusiastic rescue and treatment by the local people, came to Yan'an on the 17th of this month to seek refuge. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, people from all walks of life in Yan'an held a grand meeting in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Assembly Hall to welcome Mr. Li. Attendees included Lin Boqu, Xu Teli, Lu Dingyi, Xi Zhongxun, Liu ＠, Zhang Zonglin, Zhang Shushi, Liu Shanben, and over a thousand people from various sectors. Liu Jingfan, Vice Chairman of the Border Region Government, delivered a welcoming speech. Zhao Boping, Deputy Director of the Education Department, reported on Mr. Li's involvement in the democratic cultural movement and the details of his escape from the assassination attempt. Mr. Li was then invited to speak. Amidst warm applause from the audience, Mr. Li Furen took the stage. He first thanked everyone for their warm and sincere welcome and conveyed the Democratic League's congratulations for the health of Chairman Mao and the comrades of the Chinese Communist Party. After briefly describing the education, culture, and democratic movement in Shaanxi Province in recent years, Mr. Li said, "I have been teaching in the Kuomintang area for twenty years, and one thing I can take comfort in is that I have not betrayed my conscience. However, under reactionary rule, it is very difficult to fully act according to one's conscience and survive. I often told young people honestly that I had five parts of conscience, but I only dared to use one part to do things, and even that one part had to take into account the Kuomintang authorities. Even with such compromises, the reactionaries still falsely accused me of being a 'left-leaning' bastard and tried to kill me. They still didn't want me to live." Mr. Li said indignantly, "The Kuomintang secret agents gave me a bullet, but they didn't kill me. But they themselves are swallowing a slow-acting bomb that will one day destroy them. (Warm applause from the audience) How long can the Kuomintang secret agents live? How many secret agents are there? Can they kill and exterminate all the people in the country? Their assassination is tantamount to suicide." (Loud applause) Finally, Mr. Li said, "Even a little bit of effort is worthwhile if it's for the people, and a drop of blood shed for the people will not be in vain. As the saying goes, 'Money can't buy looking back.' Now that I think about it, my blood was not shed in vain. The Democratic League will cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party to fight to the end for China's democratic cause." At this point, someone in the audience requested that Lieutenant Liu Shanben speak. Liu Shanben stepped onto the stage and said with emotion, "Mr. Li risked his life for the people by running newspapers and doing things for them. Looking back, although I didn't fly planes to bomb the Chinese people in the past, I am very ashamed of transporting military supplies for the reactionaries to slaughter the people. Therefore, I made up my mind to jump out of the sea of suffering. In the past, I was very afraid of death because if I died then, no one would understand my true feelings, but it's different now. From now on, I can contribute my life to the Chinese people without any hesitation." The welcome meeting concluded with warm applause from the audience.

　　延安各界盛大集会欢迎
    李敷仁先生避难来延
    李氏为民盟西北领袖遭国特暗杀未死
    【新华社延安二十四日电】在咸阳被特务暗杀未死的名教育家、民俗学者、民主同盟西北总支部主要负责人之一——李敷仁先生在当地人民热心救护治疗下，于本月十七日来延安避难。昨日下午二时，延安各界在陕甘宁边区参议会礼堂举行盛大集会欢迎李先生。到林伯渠、徐特立、陆定一、习仲勋、柳＠、张宗麟、张曙时、刘善本及各界千余人。由边府刘景范副主席致欢迎词，教厅副厅长赵伯平报告李先生从事民主文化运动，和此次被难脱险经过。随即邀请先生讲话，在全场热烈掌声中，李敷仁先生登台，他首先对大家的热烈和诚挚的欢迎致谢，并代表民盟祝贺毛主席及中共同志的健康，在略述年来陕省教育文化及民主运动经过后，李先生说：“我在国民党区教书二十年，有一点可以自慰的，就是没有昧良心，但是在反动统治下，要完全拿出良心来做事，是很难活下去的，我常常对青年讲良心话，说我有五分良心，只敢拿出一分来做事，连这一分还要照顾到国民党当局，就是这样委曲求全，反动派还是诬我为“左倾”混蛋分子，向我下这样的毒手，还是不要我活下去”。李先生愤慨地说：“国民党特务给了我一颗枪弹，并没有打死我，但他们自己等于吞食一颗慢性炸弹，将来有一天是要炸毁他们自己的。（全场热烈鼓掌）国民党特务的寿命能有多长？特务分子能有多少？全国的人民他们能杀尽斩绝么？他们的暗杀就等于自杀。”（大鼓掌）最后李先生说：“一分热只要为人民出了也是有代价的，一滴血只要为人民流了都不会白费的。谚语说：“有钱难买回头望”，现在想起来，我的血是没有白流的，民盟将与中共合作为中国的民主事业奋斗到底。”至此，会场上有人要求请刘善本上尉讲话，刘上尉即步入讲台前感奋的说：“李先生为人民办报，为人民作事，几乎牺牲掉生命；回想起来，我过去虽没有驾机轰炸中国人民，但给反动派运送了屠杀人民的军火也是十分惭愧，因此我就下定决心跳出苦海。过去我很惧怕死，因为那时如果死去，就没有人明白自己的心迹，但以后不同了，以后我可以把我的生命无所顾虑的贡献给中国人民。”欢迎会在全场热烈掌声中结束。
