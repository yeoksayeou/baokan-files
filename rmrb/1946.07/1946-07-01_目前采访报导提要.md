　　Currently, interview report highlights:
    I. The Kuomintang reactionaries are actively preparing for a full-scale civil war, plotting a large-scale attack on us. We should closely monitor the Kuomintang army's military movements, civil war deployments, and secret agent activities; expose in detail the various atrocities of the Kuomintang army and puppet troops, fully express the masses' desire for peace, opposition to civil war, and hatred of puppet and die-hard troops. Publicize the new heroism of the military and civilians in the Liberated Areas in the self-defense war, and introduce various model figures and model deeds. Vigorously report on the various situations of the masses in the rear supporting the front lines, as well as the mood of the masses and the progress of recovery work after our army recovered the towns. Comrades in the border areas should also pay more attention to the Kuomintang army's tyrannical behavior in its occupied areas and the living conditions of the local masses. The training of our army must be vigorously reported.
    II. The mass movement in various places is gradually becoming widespread and in-depth, and the land reform work teams have also gone to the countryside. Fully reflecting this vigorous land reform movement is a long-term task for this newspaper in the future. We should fully expose the various cruel oppression and exploitation of peasants by traitors, illegal despots, and evil landlords in politics and economics, report on the masses' desire for liberation, the scale and progress of the land reform movement, publicize the various creations of the masses in this movement, and introduce the masses' joyful mood after liberation, their active production and prosperity, and the various changes in social customs. Please choose typical examples for reporting methods, expressing this great social reform movement through a struggle, a movement, a meeting, or a peasant's liberation process. Important and wonderful events can be reported continuously. When introducing experience, it is best to use specific facts, as long as the detailed process of an event, how it was done, and the results are clearly stated. The experience is inherent in it.
    III. This year's production season is more than halfway through, so what new creations are there in mutual aid production in the old liberated areas, and what problems exist in large-scale production in the new liberated areas? How are they being solved? How are the land reform movement, the production movement, and the self-defense movement combined? We must answer these questions through specific facts. In the production movement, some old rich peasants have been reformed, and some new rich peasants have emerged one after another. The face of the countryside has undergone tremendous changes through mass movements and production. We should reflect this with typical facts, statistics...
    IV. Urban industry and commerce are vigorously recovering and actively developing. We must use great strength to report on various situations related to this issue, and report typically and forcefully on model deeds of unity between employers and employees, labor-management cooperation, and the various creations of technicians and workers in creating industry and transforming commerce.
    V. Cultural and educational construction, health construction, demobilization work... and various social events, please also quickly and promptly seize and report.
