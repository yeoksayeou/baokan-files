　　US Delays Trial of Japanese War Criminals
    Courtroom Resembles Child's Play
    Kijūrō Shidehara Lies to His Face, Defendants Roar with Laughter in Court
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] Moscow Radio today broadcast a comprehensive report on the trial of major Japanese war criminals, stating: The trial has already lasted 75 days and will be extended again at the request of the defense. For the past 45 days, the situation in the courtroom has not been a trial of war criminals, but rather a conversation between the Allied forces and the Japanese war criminals. The testimonies of witnesses and the arguments of defense attorneys continue to cover up for the war criminals using their usual tricks from the Japanese aggression. For example, when Kijūrō Shidehara testified the other day, when asked whether the current 28 defendants should include the military clique, Shidehara, who was the Minister of the Army and Commander of the Kwantung Army during the invasion of Manchuria in 1931, gave a negative answer to this question. According to his explanation, the military clique should include some young officers, but he did not even know their names. Shidehara's lying tricks brought satisfied smiles to the faces of those in the defendant's box. When asked who commanded the Kwantung Army when Japan invaded Manchuria, the former Prime Minister actually replied, "I don't know." At that time, the defendants in the box could not help but laugh loudly. Nevertheless, the progress of the trial proved the crimes of the defendants. Most interesting was the testimony of the son of former Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai, who was assassinated by fascists, revealing that the Japanese Emperor directly participated in the Japanese army's invasion of Manchuria and the role of General Koiso in expanding the aggression. When these people exposed the crimes of the defendants and the Japanese Emperor, many of the defendants' friends and followers threatened them with shameless assassination, and the witnesses had received many threatening letters. Moscow Radio pointed out that when the spirit of militarism and fascism is fully displayed in the courtroom where major Japanese war criminals are being tried, it is difficult to talk about Japan's true democratization.

　　美国拖延审讯日战犯
    法庭情形有如儿戏
    币原当面撒谎被告哄笑公堂
    【新华社延安二十四日电】莫斯科今日广播综合报导日本主要战犯审判情形称：这审判已过了七十五天，根据辩护人的要求又将延长。过去四十五天法庭上的情形，不是在审判战犯，而是盟军方面在与日本战犯们举行谈话会。作证人与辩护人的发言，仍以自己在日本侵略中的惯伎替战犯掩护。如前日的币原在出庭作证时，当被询以目前二十八名被告中应否包括军派在内，此一九三一年侵满时当过陆相、关东军司令的币原，对这一问题竟给以否定的回笞。据他解释，军派应包括一些年青军官，可是他们的姓名他也不知道。币原的撒谎伎俩，在被告席上的人中露出了满意的喜色。当询以日本侵入满洲时是谁指挥关东军，这位前首相竟回答“不知道”。当时被告席上也忍不住大笑起来。虽然如此，审判的进程乃证明了被告的罪行。最有趣的是被法西斯暗杀的前首相犬养毅之子的供词，揭露了日皇直接参加日军侵入满洲的勾当，及小矶将军在扩大侵犯中的作用。当这些人揭露被告及日皇的罪行时，许多被告的朋友与信徒即以无耻的暗杀手段来威胁他们，证人已接到许多恫吓信件。莫斯科广播指出，当审判日本主要战犯的法庭上，被告席上表现充分的军阀与法西斯精神时，很难讲到日本真正的民主化。
