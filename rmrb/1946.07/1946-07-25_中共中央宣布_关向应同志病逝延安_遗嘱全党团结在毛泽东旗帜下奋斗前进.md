    A Brief Biography of Comrade Guan Xiangying

    Comrade Guan Xiangying was 44 years old, a Manchu, born in Jin County, Liaoning Province. He came from a poor family and worked as a printing worker. In 1923, he joined the Socialist Youth League and worked in the Shanghai Northeast Citizens Association. In 1924, he went to the Soviet Union for studies and joined the Communist Party of China in 1925. After the May 30th Movement broke out, he returned to China and worked in the Shanghai Pudong Communist Youth League. In 1926, he went to Shandong to work for the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League. In 1927, after the April 12th Incident, he went to Hankou and worked there for a period of time before going to Henan to serve in the Henan Provincial Committee. Later, he returned to Shanghai to work in the Central Organization Department of the Communist Youth League. In 1928, at the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee and later served as the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. In 1930, he successively participated in the work of the Military Commission of the Chinese Red Army and the Yangtze River Bureau of the CCP Central Committee. In 1931, he worked in the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and was soon arrested and imprisoned, demonstrating a strong proletarian revolutionary integrity in prison. After his release, he went to the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou Soviet Area as the Political Commissar of the Second Front Army of the Red Army, during which he played a great role in the construction of the Second Front Army and the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou Revolutionary Base Area. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the Political Commissar of the 120th Division, and together with Commander He Long, created the Jinxi Liberated Area. At the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1945, he was re-elected as a member of the Central Committee. In the autumn of 1941, he returned to Yan'an for treatment due to severe lung disease. On April 24, 1943, due to his serious illness, he made a will to the whole party, briefly stating: "At this final moment of my life, I would like to bid farewell to the leader of the party, to the Seventh National Congress of the party, and to all comrades of the party. I sincerely hope that all comrades of the party, at any time, will strive forward under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. The entire party and the entire army should be like one person, closely united around the Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong. I believe that our party and the Chinese revolution will surely achieve final victory." Afterwards, his condition fluctuated, and although he received careful treatment from doctors, he ultimately did not recover due to years of overwork and loss of resistance. In mid-July of 1946, his condition deteriorated further, and he passed away on July 21st.
