Xinhua News Agency, Somewhere East of the Pinghan Railway in the Central Plains, 23rd: Military news: Chiang's army has been fiercely attacking our Central Plains troops east of the Pinghan Railway for days, and has declared that they will "completely suppress" them before the 31st. Fierce fighting is taking place in three areas. The Chiang army's pursuing "bandit suppression" troops in the Central Plains area east of the railway have recently been reinforced with three new divisions, namely the 102nd Division of the Fourth Army originally stationed in Tai'an, Jiangxi, the 169th Division of the 26th Army from Daye, Hubei, and the New 10th Division of the 58th Army from Fuyang, Anhui. In addition, there are local security forces from various counties. The Li Xiannian unit, stationed east of the Pinghan Railway, was forced to adopt decentralized operations after breaking through the Chiang army's encirclement. One part of it moved to the area between Macheng and Luotian in northern Hubei, and its north and west sides continue to be fiercely pursued by the Chiang Kai-shek's 34th Division of the 72nd Army and the New 13th Division. On the south side, the 169th Division of the 26th Army and part of the 102nd Division of the Fourth Army of Chiang's army are moving north from Xishui and Huangmei south of Luotian to block and intercept. Our army was surrounded on three sides and had no choice but to move into the area between Yuexi, Qianshan, and Taihu in Anhui Province. Chiang's army is busy mobilizing troops to encircle and attack. Another part of our breakout troops, after moving to the area between Shangcheng and Lihuang, engaged in fierce fighting with the intercepting 154th Division of the 48th Army and the New 10th Division of the 58th Army. It then turned into Anhui Province and went north through Huoshan, only to encounter the 176th Division of the 48th Army of Chiang's army, which was deployed on the Hefei-Lu'an line, blocking the way. After fierce fighting, it finally crossed the Hefei-Yejiagji Highway blockade line (from Hefei-Yejiagji to the junction of Henan and Anhui) near Lu'an and is currently continuing to fight fiercely with the Chiang army pursuing north. The Chiang army's 72nd Army in the central area of the Central Plains Liberated Area around Xuanhua Store has been repeatedly "mopping up" for days, wantonly extorting and looting, arresting and massacring the people in large numbers, and torturing and killing our wounded and sick soldiers who remained in the area and had not been evacuated. The area has become a world of terror.

　　中原我军胜利突围
    六安以北与蒋军激战中
    【新华社中原平汉路东某地廿三日电】军息：蒋军连日对平汉路东我中原部属猛烈进攻，并扬言于三十一日以前彻底“肃清”。激战正在三个地区进行中。蒋军在路东中原地区之追“剿”部队，近又新调三个师，即原驻江西台安之第四军一○二师、湖北大冶之二十六军一六九师、安徽阜阳之五十八军新十师，此外尚有各县地方保安团队。留置于平汉路东之李先念部，突破蒋军包围后，即被迫采取分散作战。其中一部转至鄂北麻城、罗田之间，其北面西面继续遭受蒋介石之七十二军三十四师、新十三师猛烈追击。南面又有蒋军二十六军一六九师及第四军一○二师一部，自罗田南面之浠水、黄梅方面北上堵击。我军三面受敌，不得已移入安徽境内岳西、潜山、太湖之间地区，蒋军正繁忙调集部队前往围攻。另一部我突围部队转至商城、立煌之间后，与截击蒋军四十八军一五四师、五十八军新十师发生激战，前折入安徽境内经霍山北上，则遇布置于合肥、六安一线之蒋军四十八军一七六师堵击，经力战后，始于六安附近越过合叶公路封锁线（自合叶至豫皖交界处之叶家集），刻与北上追击之蒋军继续激战中，宣化店周围之中原解放区中心地带蒋军七十二军，连日反复“清剿”，肆意勒索抢掠，大批逮捕屠杀民众，对我留置当地未及移走之伤病员百般虐待处死，该区已成恐怖世界。
