Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th: Tokyo dispatch: MacArthur sent a report to the War Department in Washington on the work of the occupation of Japan in May, in which he expressed satisfaction with the Yoshida Shigeru cabinet, which he called a moderate militarist. He said: "The formation of the Yoshida cabinet marks an important step in the democratization of Japan and gives the Japanese valuable political experience in representative government." MacArthur also said: "The position of the Yoshida cabinet will not be shaken for some time. If Yoshida has to give way to a new cabinet, the parliament should not be dissolved and new elections should be held to overcome the crisis." When talking about the Japanese democratic front movement, MacArthur said with fear: "The development of the labor front marks a growing anxiety." He also said: "This anxiety has been cleverly exploited by left-wing politicians. The Communist Party and their sympathizers, as well as the left-wing Socialist Party, seem to be organizing the May demonstrations and taking the lead." MacArthur still believes that the violent warning he issued on May 20 is still valid, and said that it is to deal with "left-wing politicians" because MacArthur believes that the "left-wing politicians" who lead these Japanese democratic movements are "a tangible threat." In explaining the Japanese food shortage, MacArthur believes that it is "due to the drastic shipping of rice between the counties." The report does not mention the facts revealed by the Japanese people and Allied journalists that the behavior of landlords, plutocrats, and bureaucrats has deepened social hunger, but only lightly states: "Japanese farmers are extremely unwilling to transport the grain stored in their villages again."

　　麦克阿瑟报告美陆军部捧吉田内阁怕民主运动
    【新华社延安十五日电】东京讯：麦克阿瑟于十三日致华府陆军部关于五月份占领日本的工作报告一份，在报告中对军国主义稳健派吉田茂内阁表示满意。他说：“吉田内阁的组成，是日本民主化过程中一个重要步骤的标志，是给与日本人以代议政府有价值的政治经验”。麦氏并说：“吉田内阁在若干时间内，其地位不致发生动摇。万一吉田不得不让位于新内阁时，亦不可解散议会，举行新的选举来克服危机。”谈到日本民主阵线运动时，麦氏竟以恐惧的神气说：“劳工阵线的发展，标志出日益滋长的惶惶不安。”又说：“此种不安已为左翼政治分子巧妙的利用，共产党和他们的同情者以及左翼社会党，似乎在组织五月份的示威，乘势起了领导作用。”对于其在五月二十日发表的暴力警告，麦氏仍认为继续有效，并表示系对付“左翼的政治分子”。因麦氏以为领导这些日本民主运动的“左翼政治分子”，是“有形的威胁”。在解释日本粮荒时，麦氏认为系“由于各县间大米航运之剧烈”。对日本人民与盟国记者所揭发的地主、财阀、官僚之行为，得以加深社会饥馑的事实，报告中则只字不提，只是轻描淡写的说道：“日本农民极端不愿再次运走他们村中的存粮。”
