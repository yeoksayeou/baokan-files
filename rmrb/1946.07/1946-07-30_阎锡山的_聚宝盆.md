　　Yan Xishan's "Treasure Trove"
    Shi Huaibi

    I. The Chairman Praises, The People Resent

    Yan Xishan calls his bloody, exploitative "soldier-farmer integration" policy, the "Treasure Trove." It is said that when Yan Xishan went to Chongqing last year, he boasted to Chiang Kai-shek about his counter-revolutionary, anti-people policy, saying that it could be used to resist the Communist Party's rent reduction and interest rate reduction, and that the people of Shanxi Province welcomed and demanded its implementation. Murderous executioners always echo each other and collude. Yan Xishan's anti-people policy was actually praised by Chiang Kai-shek in person, and he was allowed to try it out in Shanxi first. So, after Yan Xishan returned to Taiyuan from Chongqing, he greatly boasted that his "soldier-farmer integration" was "approved by the Central Government and praised by the Chairman"; on the other hand, he mobilized his ruling pawns - the rural local bullies - to coerce public opinion and demand the implementation of the "Treasure Trove." In the Fendong Daobao and Zhenzhong Daily in March and April, today it published that the people of Jiexiu demanded the "Treasure Trove", and tomorrow it published that the people of Pingyao demanded the "Treasure Trove", as if the Bodhisattva really appeared.

    Whether Yan Xishan's "soldier-farmer integration" is good or bad, the people of Fendong understand it best! Because his "soldier-farmer integration" was first implemented in Fendong (the area of Xiangling, Fushan, and Linfen). A folk song is widely circulated among the people of Fendong, describing Yan Xishan's "Treasure Trove": "Young lads are pulled into the army, girls and daughters-in-law are made public, wives and old men fill the pits, and children and babies can't even be sold!" This is the most sincere reflection of the people of Fendong on Yan Xishan's "Treasure Trove."

    In Linfen city, which is under the direct rule of Yan Xishan, the shopkeepers of several merchants also said: "The Treasure Trove is indeed a treasure trove, but it is the officials who get rich, and the people who get poor." This is also a penetrating and profound remark.

    II. "Soldier-Farmer Integration" and "Organization"

    The first step of Yan Xishan's "soldier-farmer integration" is compulsory organization. Young and strong men between the ages of seventeen and forty-five in the village are organized into groups of three, and one of the three is drawn as a regular soldier, and the other two are national soldiers. (Regular soldiers enlist, national soldiers farm at home). People who are of national soldier age but are disabled are called pure national soldiers (meaning they do not enlist). Most of those who serve as regular soldiers are children from poor families, because everyone is afraid of being a regular soldier and being sent to die. In the village, regular soldiers are drawn by the method of "drawing lots, drawing paper eggs". When wealthy children are drawn to be regular soldiers, they immediately pay for grain to hire someone to go in their place; poor children, when drawn to be regular soldiers, have no grain and have to be cannon fodder. Those in power in the village, or those who are less literate and of national soldier age, all became village cadres and implemented deferred service (Yan Xishan's large village organization had forty to fifty cadres), forming a ruling and exploiting network in the countryside.

    After the organization, the second step is to distribute land, confiscating the land of all the people in the village and distributing it to the national soldiers. The old and young over forty-five and under seventeen are not allocated land, depriving the old and weak of land ownership. Yan Xishan stipulates that their lives should be assisted by the national soldiers, who pay wages. In reality, they have no labor and no one hires them, so they only starve. Moreover, the income of the national soldiers is not enough to cover their expenses, let alone pay wages to hire labor?

    Two national soldiers support the family of one regular soldier. Each national soldier gives the regular soldier five shi of wheat and ten jin of cotton per year (if the family is very poor, they will not receive any relief at all). The land allocated to the regular soldier is also cultivated by the national soldiers, and the national soldiers who have obtained the land are responsible for all the labor and burdens. In the case of widows and orphans, relief grain is nominally stipulated, but in practice it is all embezzled by the village organization.

    Women are organized into women's teams to serve Yan Xishan's army, and they are trained every day to implement enslavement education. The so-called "Progress Society" and "Comrades Association" are developed among women; and a "invitation to talk" system is stipulated, with the group committee regularly inviting women to talk individually, taking the opportunity to molest, rape, etc. Liang Peihuang and Jixu Chuan, in the Dongzhang and Liangjiahe areas of Funan, have seduced women with good looks through invitations to talk. Countless women from ordinary families have been raped by Yan Xishan's subordinates. When the masses of the Dabeiqu complained, they mentioned that when they went to Hexi to do corvée labor, their wives became part of the Sixty-first Army.

    III. The Evil Consequences of the "Soldier-Farmer Integration" Policy

    The first evil consequence of the "soldier-farmer integration" policy is land desertion, sharp decline in production, and a decline in the people's living standards to an unsustainable level.

    Yan Xishan forced people under the age of seventeen and over the age of forty-five to abandon their land and leave production, concentrating the land in the hands of a few national soldiers, turning the national soldiers into Yan Xishan's serfs. However, the national soldiers cannot cultivate the land due to the heavy burden of corvée labor. Moreover, Yan Xishan built bunkers on a large scale, with each national soldier doing corvée labor for three months, making it impossible for the national soldiers to cultivate the land, and the women were unable to go to the fields because they attended meetings, received training, and were invited to talk every day. This has caused a large amount of land to be deserted. For example, in Gangtou Village, Fushan, 1,200 mu of land out of 2,500 mu was deserted. In Shangbeiqu, 180 mu out of 450 mu was deserted. In Zhangcuan, Xiangling, 800 mu out of 4,000 mu was deserted. On a county-wide scale, when Yan Xishan ruled, there were more than 8,000 mu of deserted land in southern Linfen, more than 13,000 mu in southern Fu, and more than 9,000 mu in Xiangling.

    Due to the heavy corvée labor, the number of livestock has also been greatly reduced. When Zhangcuan Village in Xiangling belonged to the liberated area, there were 145 livestock. After Yan occupied it, the livestock either died or were sold, leaving only 30 livestock. When it belonged to the liberated area, there were households that applied fertilizer to an average of 15 mu per year. When Yan occupied it, they could only apply fertilizer to 3 mu. A farmer who plowed four times, harrowed three times, and hoed three times when it belonged to the liberated area, plowed twice, harrowed once, and did not hoe after Yan occupied it. In the past, each mu could yield seven big dou, but after Yan Xishan came, it could only yield three big dou. Zhao Xiong, a villager in the village, used to have 40 mu of land and two livestock, but after Yan Xishan came, he only fed one mule. In the past, he applied fertilizer to 20 mu of his 45 mu of land every year, but later he could only apply fertilizer to 3 mu.

    Due to the desertion of land and the decline in production, the people's lives have become even more difficult. However, Yan Xishan's apportionments and plunder have only increased. The following is a survey of the burdens of two villages, which can represent the general situation.

    Survey of burdens in Liangjiajun Village, District 3, Fushan, during two years of stubborn occupation:
    The entire village has 16 households, 107 people, 430 mu of land, and 42 liang of grain silver. Each liang of grain silver is burdened as follows: 1 shi of official silver, 1 shi of additional silver, 1 shi of purchased grain, 2 dou of horse feed, 4 dou of village apportionment, 1 dou of relief grain, and 2 dou of cash-converted grain (625 yuan per liang). In addition, there are 30 shi of preferential grain (for five regular soldiers), 50 jin of cotton (equivalent to 5 shi of grain), 4 chi 9 cun of military cloth per mu, a total of 211 zhang 6 chi for the whole village (equivalent to 30 shi and 2 dou of wheat), each household plans to contribute 2 dou of wheat (to buy livestock and lend seeds to national soldiers), 1,000 jin of temporary horse feed (equivalent to 10 shi of wheat), 18,000 jin of horse grass (equivalent to 6 shi of wheat), 2,700 meals (equivalent to 13 shi and 6 dou of wheat), and entertainment expenses averaging 20 packs of cigarettes per month (equivalent to 2 shi of wheat, 24 shi per year), excluding shoes, socks, and chickens. The total burden is 282 shi and 9 dou of grain, plus 10% "loss" (28 shi and 2 dou), for a total of 311 shi and 1 dou of grain. Each liang of grain silver averages 7 shi and 4 dou, and each person averages a burden of 2 shi and 9 dou, exceeding our burden by 13 times (our burden is 2 dou and 4 sheng).

    Survey of burdens in Zhangcuan Village, Xiangling, last year during stubborn occupation:

    The entire village has 164 households, 965 people, 4,570 mu of land, and 456 liang of grain silver.
    The burden of paying grain and money upwards: 2 shi and 2 dou of grain for each liang of grain silver, 5 zhang 6 chi of cloth for each liang of grain silver (equivalent to 5 dou and 5 sheng of grain), half a jin of cotton for each liang of grain silver (5 sheng of wheat), 100 shi of grain purchased on behalf (2 dou and 2 sheng of grain for each liang of grain silver), 300,000 yuan of assistance money (657 yuan per liang of grain silver, equivalent to 2 dou and 5 sheng of grain), 4 dou of horse feed. The above totals 1,663 shi and 7 dou of grain, averaging a burden of 3 shi and 6 dou 7 sheng for each liang of grain silver.
    The burden of village apportionment: 4 dou of grain for each liang of grain silver, totaling 182 shi and 4 dou. 250 shi of preferential grain (each household plans to contribute 40 yuan), totaling 38,600 yuan, equivalent to 129 shi of grain. National soldier ID cards cost 900 yuan (equivalent to 3 dou of wheat), 5,000 jin of temporary horse feed (45 shi of wheat), 75,000 jin of horse grass (equivalent to 25 shi of wheat), 8,500 meals (equivalent to 85 shi of wheat), and 150 shi of entertainment expenses. The above totals 868 shi and 7 dou of grain.
    The two types of grain and money paid upwards and village apportionment: totals 2,532 shi and 4 dou of grain, plus 10% (loss) 253 shi and 2 dou 4 sheng, for a total burden of 2,785 shi and 6 dou of grain. Each liang of grain silver averages a burden of 6 shi and 2 dou, and each person averages a burden of 2 shi and 9 dou 5 sheng, exceeding our burden by 10 times.

    Due to Yan Xishan's "soldier-farmer integration" and plunder policy, the lives of the people of Fendong have fallen to a shockingly pitiful level. The following is a change in the people's living conditions:

    When Zhangcuan Village in Xiangling belonged to the liberated area, people had three meals a day. Breakfast was rice soup and steamed buns, with stir-fried cabbage and chili peppers. Lunch was white noodles, seasoned with stir-fried vegetables. Dinner was rice soup and steamed buns. Two-thirds of the families had wine and meat during the New Year and holidays. After Yan Xishan ruled, breakfast was rice soup, sweet potatoes, wheat bran, and corn flour buns (not enough to eat). Lunch was corn kernels and wild vegetables. Dinner was the same as breakfast. They could not afford wine and meat during the New Year and holidays.

    When Shangbeiqu, District 3, Fushan, belonged to the liberated area, breakfast was half white flour and half corn flour steamed buns, rice soup with radish and vegetables. Lunch was dry noodles with vegetables. Dinner was corn kernel soup, and corn flour and wheat flour half-and-half buns. After Yan Xishan came, breakfast was half corn kernel and half vegetable "w窝窝". Lunch was corn and bran half-and-half porridge "w窝窝". Dinner was bean noodles, thin vegetable rice.

    The above refers to the lives of ordinary middle-class families. As for the poor, they could not even afford the above food and drink. During the spring famine this year, one-quarter of the families in southern Fu ate bran and vegetables. The above materials can represent the general situation in Fendong. In the past, people often said: "Golden Xiangling, Silver Taiping, followed by Quwo and Yicheng." Under Yan Xishan's rule, the situation has changed. Now, after our army liberated the area, it has gradually recovered, and the people have turned over.

    The second evil consequence of Yan Xishan's "soldier-farmer integration" is the increase in the people's disease and mortality rates.

    Due to Yan Xishan's harsh and tyrannical rule, the people could not bear the suffering, and many fled. Also, due to poor living conditions and insufficient nutrition, the disease and mortality rates increased.

    In Shangbeiqu, District 3, Southern Fushan, out of 20 households and 130 people, 30 people died of illness within one year of Yan Xishan's rule (including 7 children), 45 people had scabies, 80 people suffered from typhoid fever, 3 young people fled to avoid being organized, and 5 households fled because they could not make a living. 50 households fled from Gangtou Village, Fushan, 179 people died, and 16 households were completely wiped out.

    In Zhangcuan Village, Xiangling, during the year or so that Yan Xishan ruled, 45 households out of 164 households fled, 540 people suffered from typhoid fever, 70 people died, and 13 people were killed by Yan Xishan.

    The third evil consequence of "soldier-farmer integration" is the abandonment of education and the closure of schools. When Zhangcuan Village in Xiangling belonged to the liberated area, 130 children attended school. The parents of the children had great hopes for the new masters in the future. The main production tasks at home were taken care of by family members, and the children could concentrate on studying. The teachers were very interested, and their dedication and efforts to the education cause made great progress in all aspects of the school. Since Yan Xishan came, the number of children in the school has decreased to about 30. Many children who should have been in school have dropped out due to family poverty. Yan Xishan demolished three rooms of the school in order to build bunkers. The situation in District 3, Fushan, is the same as in Xiangling. I talked to the teacher in Zhangcuan Village several times. He said: "Everything changed after the stubbornness came. You teach students Japanese textbooks, and he doesn't say anything; if you want to teach the Eighth Route Army, you risk being beheaded. Once I wrote the character '八' (eight) on the blackboard, and the group committee came and examined it for a long time, and checked the books on my desk for a long time."

    In order to implement his "soldier-farmer integration" policy, Yan Xishan exploited and oppressed the people, and adopted a large village organization system. The number of personnel in each large village office is equivalent to our county government, and its expenses are several times larger than our county government. Last year, the Dengzhuang Yan Xishan village office spent more than 57,000 yuan in half a month.

    Yan Xishan is promoting his "benevolent government" on the basis of corpses scattered across the land. Chiang Kai-shek also shamelessly praises this "benevolent government." These people have done all the despicable things in the world.

　　阎锡山的“聚宝盆”
    史怀必
    一、委座称赞人民愤恨
    阎锡山把他的血腥统治掠夺的“兵农合谋”政策，美其名曰“聚宝盆。”据说阎锡山去年到重庆时，曾在蒋介石面前，吹嘘自己这一套反革命反人民的政策，据说可以用以抵制共产党的减租减息，说什么晋省人民如何欢迎要求实行等等。杀人的刽子手们，总是互相呼应狼狈为奸的。阎锡山的反人民政策，竟得到蒋介石当面称赞，并允许在山西先行试办。于是阎锡山从重庆回到太原后，一面大大吹嘘其“兵农合谋”为“中央批准，委座称颂”；另一面则动员其统治爪牙——农村土劣，挟持民意，要求实行“聚宝盆。”在三四月份的汾东导报与阵中日报，今天刊登介休人民要求“聚宝盆”，明天刊登平遥人民要求“聚宝盆”，好像真是菩萨出现了。
    阎锡山的“兵农合谋”是好是坏，汾东人民体会的再深刻不过了！因为他的“兵农合谋”首先在汾东（襄陵、浮山、临汾一带）实行过。汾东人民普遍流行着一首歌谣，描写阎锡山的“聚宝盆”：“青年小伙拔了兵，姑娘媳妇儿充了公，老婆老汉填了坑，小孩娃娃沽不成！”这就是汾东人民对阎锡山的“聚宝盆”最真切的反映。
    在阎锡山直接统治下的临汾城内，也有几家商号的掌柜这样说：“聚宝盆确实是聚宝盆，不过是官家聚富了，把人民锯穷了。”这也是一针见血再深刻不过了。
    二、“兵农合谋”与“编组”
    阎锡山的“兵农合谋”第一步是强制编组，将村里十七岁以上，四十五岁以下的青年壮年，编为三人一组，三人之中抽一人为常备兵，两人为国民兵。（常备兵入伍，国民兵在家种地）。在国民兵年龄而残废的人，称为纯国民兵（意即不入伍）。充当常备兵的，大多为家境贫寒子弟，因为谁也怕当常备兵送死去。在村里抽常备兵是采取“抽笺、抽纸蛋”的办法，富有的子弟抽上当常备兵时，即出粮食雇人去；穷人子弟，抽上常备兵，没有粮食只好去当炮灰。在村里有权势的统治者，或少识字而又在国民兵年龄的人，皆当了村干部，实行缓役（阎锡山的大编村，有四十到五十个干部），形成农村中的统治剥削网。
    编组之后。第二步实行分配土地，将全村人民土地没收配给国民兵。四十五岁以上，十七岁以下的老幼，不配给土地，剥夺了老弱的土地所有权，他们的生活阎锡山规定给国民兵助耕，由国民兵给工资。而实际由于他们没有劳动力无人雇用，只有饿肚皮。而且，国民兵的收入除出负担外，连自己吃用都没有，那能出工资来雇用人工呢？
    两个国民兵养活一个常备兵的家属，每个国民兵每年给一个常备兵出麦五石、花十斤（如很穷苦人家则根本得不到救济）。常备兵分的土地也由国民兵来耕种，支差出负担统由取得土地的国民兵负责。鳏寡孤独之家，名义上规定有救济粮，实际上均被编村贪污。
    妇女则编为妇女队，给阎锡山军队服务，每天整训实行奴化教育。在妇女中又发展所谓“进步社”，与“同志会”；并规定“邀谈”制度，组委定期与妇女个别邀谈，借机调戏、强奸等。梁培璜、继续川在浮南东张、梁家河一带，曾以邀谈而诱奸有姿色的妇女。一般人家的妇女，被阎锡山部下奸淫者不可胜计。当大北渠群众诉苦时，曾谈到自己到河西支差，老婆就成了六十一军的了。
    三、“兵农合谋”政策实行的恶果
    “兵农合谋”政策实行的第一个恶果，就是土地荒芜，生产锐减，人民生活下降到不能生活的程度。
    阎锡山迫使十七岁以下，四十五岁以上的人丢掉土地，脱离生产，使土地集中到少数国民兵手中，把国民兵变做阎锡山的农奴。而国民兵又因支差、负担苛重不能耕种，又阎锡山大修碉堡，每个国民兵支差三个月，使国民兵既无法到地耕种，妇女们每天开会、受训、邀谈也无法上地，这就造成大批土地荒芜。如浮山岗头村，二千五百亩地，荒了一千二百亩。上北渠四百五十亩荒了一百八十亩。襄陵张篡四千亩荒了八百亩。按全县范围来说，阎锡山统治时，临汾南荒地八千余亩，浮南荒一万三千余亩，襄陵荒九千余亩。
    由于支差繁重，牲畜也大大减少了。襄陵张篡村属于解放区时，有一百四十五头牲口，阎占后死的死卖的卖，还有三十头牲口。属于解放区时，有每年平均上十五亩粪的人家，阎占时只能上三亩。属于解放区时，犁四次耙三次，锄三次的农家，阎占后，犁二次，耙一次不锄了。过去每亩能收七大斗，阎锡山来只能收三大斗了。该村村民赵雄，过去四十亩地两头牲口，阎锡山来只喂了一头骡子。过去四十五亩地，每年上粪二十亩，后来只能上粪三亩了。
    由于土地荒芜生产降低，人民生活就更加困难了。然而阎锡山的摊派、掠夺则有增无已。以下是两个村子的负担调查，可以代表一般状况。
    浮山三区梁家君村，两年顽占时负担调查：
    全庄十六户、一百零七口人、四百三十亩地、四十二两粮银、每两粮银负担如下：正银一石、附加一石、代购一石、马料二斗、村摊派四斗、救济粮一斗、款折粮二斗（每两六百二十五元）。另外优待粮三十石（五个常备兵），花五十斤（合粮五石），军布每亩四尺九寸，全村二百一十一丈六（折麦三十石零二斗），家家计划每户合麦二斗（给国民兵买牲口贷种），临时马料一千斤（折麦十石），马草一万八千斤（折麦六石），派饭二千七百顿（合麦十三石六斗）、应酬费每月平均二十条烟（合麦两石，全年二十四石）鞋袜鸡子除外，共负担粮二百八十二石九斗，再加一成“脱耗”（二十八石二斗），共粮三百一十一石一斗。每两粮银平均七石四斗，每人平均负担二石九斗，超过对我负担十三倍（对我负担二斗四升）。
    襄陵张篡村去年顽占时负担调查：
    全村一百六十四户，九百六十五口人，四千五百七十亩地，四百五十六两粮银。
    解上款粮负担：每两粮银二石二斗，布每两粮银五丈六尺（合粮五斗五升），花每两粮银半斤（麦五升），代购粮一百石（每两粮银二斗二升），帮差款三十万（每两粮银六百五十七元，合粮二斗五升），马料四斗，以上共粮一千六百六十三石七斗，每两粮银平均负担三石六斗七升。
    村摊派负担：每两粮银四斗，共一百八十二石四斗，优待粮二百五十石，（家家计划每户四十元），共三万八千六百元。合粮一百二十九石，国民兵身分证九百元（合麦三斗），临时马料五千斤（麦四十五石），马草七万五千斤（合麦二十五石），派饭八千五百顿（合麦八十五石），应酬费一百五十石，以上共粮八百六十八石七斗。
    解上粮款与村摊派两种：共合粮二千五百三十二石四斗，加一成（脱耗）二百五十三石二斗四升，共合负担粮二千七百八十五石六斗。每两粮银平均负担六石二斗，每人平均负担二石九斗五升。超过对我负担十倍。
    由于阎锡山的“兵农合谋”与掠夺政策，使汾东人民生活降到非常惊人的可怜程度。以下是人民生活状况的变化：
    襄陵张篡村属解放区时，人民每天三餐，早饭米汤、蒸馍，有炒白菜辣椒；午饭白面条，有油炒菜调和；晚上米汤蒸馍；过年过节有三分之二人家有酒有肉。阎锡山统治后，早饭是米汤红薯麦皮玉茭面馍（吃不饱），午饭是玉茭生子野菜，晚饭与早饭同，过年过节皆买不起酒肉了。
    浮山三区上北渠属解放区时，早饭白面玉茭面各半蒸馍，米汤有萝卜菜，午饭吃干面条有菜，晚饭玉茭生子汤，玉茭面麦面各半的馍。阎锡山来后，早饭玉茭生子和菜各半“窝窝”，午饭玉茭和糠各半稀饭“窝窝”，晚饭是豆面条子稀菜饭。
    以上是指一般中等人家的生活，至于穷苦的人连上面的吃喝也不可能。今年春荒时，浮南有四分之一的人家吃糠吃菜。以上的材料，可以代表汾东的一般情况。过去人常称：“金襄陵，银太平，数了曲沃数翼城。”在阎锡山统治下，情况变的不同了。到我军解放后，现在才逐渐恢复元气，人民才翻身。
    阎锡山“兵农合谋”实行的第二个恶果，是人民的疾病死亡率增大。
    由于阎锡山苛敛暴政，人民不堪其苦，逃亡者甚多。又由于生活贫困营养不足，致疾病死亡率增加。
    浮山南三区上北渠二十户、一百三十口人，在阎锡山统治的一年之内，生病死了的有三十口（内有七个小孩子），生疥疮的四十五口，患过伤寒时疫者八十口，怕编组逃跑的青年三人，无法生活逃亡了五户。浮山岗头逃亡五十户，死了一百七十九口，死绝十六户。
    襄陵张篡村，在阎锡山统治的一年多时间中，一百六十四户中逃亡了四十五户，患伤寒时疫的五百四十口人，死了的七十人，被阎锡山杀了的十三人。
    “兵农合谋”实行的第三个恶果，是教育废驰与学校倒闭。在襄陵张篡村属解放区时，曾有一百三十个儿童上学，孩子们的家长对未来的新主人抱有很大希望，家里主要生产任务由家里人负责，小孩子可以安心求学，教员很有兴趣，对教育事业的专心与努力使学校在各方面都有很大进步。自阎锡山来了以后，学校的孩子减少到三十人左右，许多应该上学的小孩子由于家庭贫困而失了学。阎锡山为了修碉堡，把学校的三间房子拆掉了。在浮山三区的情形和襄陵一样。我在张篡村与教员谈了几次话，他说：“顽固过来一切都变了。你教学生日本课本，他来了不说啥；你要教八路军的就有杀头危险。有一次我在黑板上写了个“八”字，组委来了审视了半天，又把我桌上的书检查了半天。”
    阎锡山为了实行他的“兵农合谋”政策，剥削压榨人民，采取大编村制。每个大编村村公所的人员数目，相当于我们的县政府，其开支比我们县政府大数倍。去年邓庄阎锡山村公所，半个月经费花洋五万七千余元。
    阎锡山是踏着人民死尸遍野的基础来宣传自己的“德政”的。蒋介石也毫无廉耻的歌颂这种“德政”。人间的卑鄙事情尽让这些人干完了。
