Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: News from Shanghai: A bloody tragedy occurred at Datong University here, where Mayor Wu Guozhen personally directed Nationalist military police to brutally beat students. The students of the university, having participated in the anti-civil war movement, requested the university to postpone the semester exams, but were unsuccessful. Consequently, on June 21st, they jointly refused to take the exams with the professors. Upon hearing this, Wu Guozhen personally went to the university to "lecture," forcing the students to take the exams as usual the next day. On the 22nd, Wu went to the university again to inspect and saw the students moving desks and chairs to set up a venue. Wu then insulted the students as "thugs" and ordered the Gorden Road Police Station and the Garrison Headquarters to dispatch a large number of armed military police to surround the students. The students were greatly dissatisfied with the situation and went to the loudspeaker to question Wu. For a time, applause and slogans mixed together. The military police stepped forward, snatched the students' loudspeaker, and then punched and kicked the students, brutally beating them. Many were injured, bleeding profusely. Wu left proudly.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: According to Shen Bao: An unprecedented bloody massacre of students by the Nationalist army occurred in Xuzhou. On the 25th of last month, when students of Xuzhou Middle School were holding a general cleaning, a jeep of a certain army company commander stationed in the backyard of the school suddenly sped up. The students were slightly slow to give way. The company commander then scolded the students as "slaves of a subjugated nation, worse than cattle and horses." The entire student body could not tolerate this and questioned him. Enraged, the company commander gathered all the officers and soldiers of the company, armed with American equipment, set up three heavy machine guns, and fiercely strafed more than 300 students of the school, killing more than a dozen students on the spot and wounding more than 20, with blood flowing everywhere. The school's director of studies was also shot seven times and died. The next day, students throughout Xuzhou went on strike in protest.
