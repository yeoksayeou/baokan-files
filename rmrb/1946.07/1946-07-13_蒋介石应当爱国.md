　　Chiang Kai-shek Should Love His Country
　　Chen Boda
    Everyone understands that Chiang Kai-shek is able to carry out the anti-people civil war and continue his fascist dictatorship entirely because he relies on the assistance of American imperialist elements. In order to obtain American assistance to achieve his anti-people civil war and fascist dictatorship, Chiang Kai-shek has paid the price of the entire nation.
    First, he has expended China's territorial rights, allowing American troops to be stationed in China and giving the United States army bases.
    Second, he has expended China's air rights, allowing American planes to freely "patrol" all of China and giving the United States air force bases.
    Third, he has expended China's maritime rights, allowing the American navy to freely travel in China's territorial waters and freely station in China's seaports, giving the United States naval bases.
    Fourth, he has expended China's political power, insisting on giving the final decision-making power on China's internal affairs (later the Kuomintang changed it to arbitration power, adjudication power, etc., but the content is the same) to the United States.
    Fifth, he has expended China's military power, replacing "nationalization of the army" with Americanization of the army, placing it under the control of the American military advisory group.
    Sixth, he has cooperated with the United States to train special agents, making it more convenient for American imperialist elements to control China's internal affairs.
    Seventh, he has abandoned protective tariffs, causing the bankruptcy of national free industry.
    Eighth, he has formulated new company laws that facilitate the manipulation of foreign capital, allowing foreign consortia and their Chinese lackeys to freely monopolize China's economy within China.
    Ninth, he has expended China's navigation rights, allowing foreign ships to destroy the domestic shipping industry.
    Tenth, he has expended China's fishing rights, accepting MacArthur's decision to allow Japanese ships to fish along the Chinese coast.
    Of course, the items listed here are only some of the major ones. We are not yet clear about the full content of the secret agreements between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, but judging from these well-known major items alone, the national sovereignty that Chiang Kai-shek has expended is from land to sea, from the sky to the ground, from politics to economics, from the present to the future. This is an unprecedented fire sale of Chinese sovereignty! The fifth item of Japan's Twenty-One Demands was to demand control of China's political, financial, military, and police powers, directly turning China into a Japanese colony. At that time, Yuan Shikai still had some scruples. Now, compared with what Chiang Kai-shek has actually expended, we can see that some things that Yuan Shikai did not dare to promise to Japanese imperialism, and which the Japanese invaders had always sought but failed to obtain, Chiang Kai-shek has generously presented to American imperialists.
    The honor of being one of the "Big Four" that the Chinese people won in the eight-year bloody war of resistance against Japan has now been completely ruined by Chiang Kai-shek! Chiang Kai-shek does not hesitate to reduce China to America's Philippines, to reduce China to America's "Latin America," to divide China into the map of America's political, military, and economic sphere of influence, that is, not hesitating to turn China into an American protectorate, into an American colony. Under Chiang's China, everything will become "American equipment," and whether "China" can still become a geographical term will become a question mark!
    Chiang Kai-shek was originally Chinese, and he should love his country, but he concentrates his hatred on the Chinese people, on Chinese democracy. He wants to fight the people, so he can't care about the nation or the country. For eighteen years, Chiang Kai-shek's oligarchic dictatorship has caused long-term countless, most terrible, and most tragic unprecedented disasters for the Chinese nation. In the eyes of the people, this dictatorial rule has long been bankrupt and extremely isolated, but he wants to insist on his oligarchic dictatorial system. Therefore, the higher the people's democratic consciousness, the more he will seek help from foreign masters. "Rather give to foreign friends than to domestic slaves" is the traditional policy of Chinese comprador landlords, and Chiang Kai-shek is the greatest inheritor of this policy. After the September 18th Incident, Chiang Kai-shek implemented this policy, lost the Northeast, and signed the Songhu Agreement, the Tanggu Agreement, and the He-Umezu Agreement. In the early stage of the war of resistance, he still declared that what he demanded was to restore the state before the Lugouqiao Incident. Now, when the Chinese people, relying on their own flesh and blood, have defeated the Japanese invaders, when the entire Chinese people continue to stand up and demand to control the destiny of their own country, Chiang Kai-shek has once again thoroughly developed this policy.
    Chiang Kai-shek's skill and his trick lies in his ability to use the qualifications of a "Chinese" and the chairman of the Kuomintang government to exchange all of China's sovereignty for the support of the American army, navy, and air force on Chinese territory to support his anti-people civil war and oligarchic dictatorship.
    The counterparties of Chiang Kai-shek's expenditure of sovereignty and his "receiving of sovereignty" are completely different, but the two are consistent. The counterparty to his expenditure of sovereignty is the foreign master, and the counterparty to his "receiving of sovereignty" is the domestic people. His receiving of sovereignty from the people is for the purpose of expending sovereignty to his foreign masters; his expending of sovereignty to his foreign masters is for the purpose of receiving sovereignty from the people.
    The historical facts are very clear that all those who are anti-people, anti-democratic, all dictators and traitors will inevitably become traitors! If it is not inviting this foreign master, it must be inviting that foreign master, although he may strive for such and such more concealed forms at a certain time. However, when he must use more cruel and fierce means to oppose the people, he will be able to do anything. Yuan Shikai was like this, Wang Jingwei was like this, and Chiang Kai-shek is like this! No matter how different their masters are in form, the law of history is ultimately the same.
    There is no doubt that the Chinese nation is facing a great new crisis. If Chiang Kai-shek's auction policy is allowed to be carried out, then China will continue to be a foreign slave, and there will be no independence, no peace, no democracy, and even less prosperity, this is certain. This is an extremely serious struggle, and the Chinese people must have a very high degree of vigilance to avoid this new fate of slavery. The Chinese people must make persistent efforts to demand that Chiang Kai-shek not sell out the country, demand that Chiang Kai-shek love the country, demand that Chiang Kai-shek recognize the power of the people, end all the sinful acts of selling out the country, announce the secret agreements between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, and end the civil war and dictatorship. It must be known that anyone who is an enemy of the people and betrays the motherland, no matter how "proud" he is for a while, will inevitably collapse in the end. If you don't believe it, please look at the lessons of Yuan Shikai and Wang Jingwei!

　　蒋介石应当爱国
　　陈伯达
    什么人都明白，蒋介石的所以能够进行反人民的内战，继续法西斯独裁，完全是由于依靠美国帝国主义分子的接济。为着取得美国接济，以达到他这种反人民的内战与法西斯独裁之目的，蒋介石支出了全民族的代价。
    第一、支出中国的领土权，让美国军队驻在中国，给美国以陆军基地。
    第二、支出中国的领空权，让美国飞机自由“巡逻”全中国，给美国以空军基地。
    第三、支出中国的领海权，让美国海军自由往来中国的领海，自由驻防中国的海港，给美国以海军基地。
    第四、支出中国的政权，坚持把中国内政问题的最后决定权（以后国民党又改称为仲裁权、公断权等等，但内容一样）交给美国。
    第五、支出中国的军权，以军队美国化代替“军队国家化”，放在美国军事顾问团的支配之下。
    第六、与美国合作训练特务，让美国帝国主义分子更便利控制中国的内政。
    第七、放弃保护关税，使民族的自由工业破产。
    第八、制定便利外资操纵的新公司法，让外国财阀及其中国走狗，自由在中国境内垄断中国的经济。
    第九、支出中国的航行权，让外轮摧毁本国的航业。
    第十、支出中国的渔权，接受麦克阿瑟的决定，让日本船在中国沿海捕鱼。
    当然，这里所列举的不过是一些大的项目，我们现在还不清楚美蒋密约的全部内容，可是只就这些众所共知的大项目看来，蒋介石所支出的国家主权，乃是从陆上到海上，从天上到地上，从政治到经济，从现在到将来，这是对于中国主权的空前大拍卖！日本二十一条的第五号，乃是要求掌握中国的政治、财政、军警的大权，直接把中国变成日本的殖民地，那时袁世凯还有所顾忌，现在来和蒋介石所实际支出的东西比一比，我们可以看到有些原来是袁世凯所还不敢答应给日本帝国主义的东西，而且是从来日寇所求之不得的东西，蒋介石已慷慨的奉送给美国帝国主义者。
    中国人民在八年流血抗日战争中所赢得的“四强之一”的荣誉，现在已被蒋介石断送得精光！蒋介石不惜把中国降为美国的菲律宾，把中国降为美国的“拉丁美洲”，把中国划为美国政治的、军事的、经济的势力范围的地图之内，也就是不惜把中国变成美国的保护国，变成美国的殖民地。在蒋记的中国之下，一切的一切，都将变成“美国的装备”，连“中国”是否还可成为地理上的名词，都将成为问号了！
    蒋介石本来是中国人，他是应当爱国的，可是他把仇恨集中在中国人民身上，集中在中国民主主义身上，他要和人民作战，他就顾不得什么国家民族了。十八年来，蒋介石这个寡头独裁统治，造成了中国民族长期无数的最可怕、最可悲的空前灾难。在人民心目中，这个独裁统治早已破产无余了，早已极端的孤立了，但他是要坚持他这个寡头独裁制度的。因此，人民的民主觉悟越高，他就越要向外国主人求救，“宁赠友邦，勿予家奴”，这是中国大买办大地主的传统政策，蒋介石是这个政策的最大继承者。九一八事变之后，蒋介石执行了这个政策，断送了东北，签订了淞沪协定、塘沽协定和何梅协定。而在抗战初期，他仍然宣称他所要求的乃是恢复芦沟桥事变以前的状态。现在当中国人民凭借自己的血肉，把日寇打败之后，当全中国人民继续挺身起来要求掌握自己国家命运的面前，蒋介石就又彻头彻尾地发挥了这个政策。
    蒋介石的本领，蒋介石的伎俩，就是在于他能够以“中国人”和国民党政府主席的资格，不惜支出全中国的主权去交换得美国陆海空军在中国领土，支持他反人民的内战和寡头独裁制度。
    蒋介石的支出主权与他的“接收主权”，对手完全不同，但二者又是一致的东西。他支出主权的对手是外国主子，他“接收主权”的对手是本国人民。他向人民接收主权，就是为着向他的外国主子支出主权；他向他的外国主子支出主权，又是为着向人民接收主权。
    历史的事实很明白，凡是反人民、反民主的人，凡是独夫民贼，必定变成汉奸卖国贼！不是招这个外国主子，必定是招那个外国主子，虽则他在一定时候或者可以争取这样那样较掩蔽的形式。但是，当他必须用更残酷猛烈的手段来反对人民的时候，他就会什么都做得出来。袁世凯是这样，汪精卫是这样，蒋介石又是这样！不管他们的主子怎样形式上不同，但历史的规律究竟是一个。
    毫无疑问的，中国民族正面临着一个极大的新危机，如果蒋介石的拍卖政策得以贯彻下去，那么中国就将继续当外国的奴隶，就将没有独立，没有和平，没有民主，更不会有什么富强，这是一定的。这是极严重的斗争，中国人民必须有极高度的警觉，以避免这新的奴隶的命运。中国人民必须再接再厉，起来要求蒋介石不要卖国，要求蒋介石爱国，要求蒋介石认清人民的力量，终止卖国的一切罪恶行为，公布美蒋之间的密约，结束内战与独裁。必须知道，凡是与人民为敌而出卖祖国的人，不管他一时如何“骄傲”，最后都必无例外地要自己倒塌下去。如果不信，请看袁世凯和汪精卫的前车！
