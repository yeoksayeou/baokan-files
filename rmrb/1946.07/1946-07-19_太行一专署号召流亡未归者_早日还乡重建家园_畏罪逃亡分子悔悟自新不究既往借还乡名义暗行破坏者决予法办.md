[Changzhi News from this newspaper] The Taihang First Special District recently issued a proclamation calling on the small number of refugees in the liberated areas who have not yet returned home to return as soon as possible to rebuild their peaceful lives and jointly devote themselves to the construction of a new society. It states: Those who fled to avoid being ravaged by the enemy and puppets during the War of Resistance have mostly returned to their hometowns after liberation and rebuilt their homes with the support of the government. There are still a very small number who have not yet returned, and the government and the people are eagerly awaiting their swift return. It is hoped that they will not disappoint the earnest concern of the government and their neighbors. Those who have no means of livelihood after returning will be given assistance. Those who left the liberated areas after liberation due to rumors and deception by the enemy, puppets, and reactionaries are also welcomed back by the government and the people with the greatest enthusiasm. The stability and prosperity of the liberated areas today are enough to expose any rumors and deception. Even those who fled in fear of punishment for having surrendered to the enemy or resisted laws and decrees are expected to return, repent, and start anew. Specific measures: (1) Those who fled only due to war disasters will be given relief by the government upon their return. Poor peasants who fled after being deceived will also be given relief upon registration after their return. (2) Personnel of puppet armies and puppet organizations who return, register with the government, and confess to the masses will be treated leniently or pardoned depending on the circumstances. (3) Those who fled for resisting laws and decrees such as rent reduction will be given security guarantees upon their return after repenting. (4) Those who were threatened or lured into participating in the reactionary "Volunteer Labor Corps" in Shimen, Yuanshi, and other places to disturb our region will not be held accountable for their past actions upon their return after repenting. (5) Those who return under the guise of returning home to engage in espionage activities will be dealt with according to the law; those who repent and confess will be allowed to start anew. (6) Those who return with illegal weapons and reactionary propaganda materials will be rewarded immediately after voluntarily surrendering them; those who conceal them and fail to report them will be dealt with according to the law once discovered.
