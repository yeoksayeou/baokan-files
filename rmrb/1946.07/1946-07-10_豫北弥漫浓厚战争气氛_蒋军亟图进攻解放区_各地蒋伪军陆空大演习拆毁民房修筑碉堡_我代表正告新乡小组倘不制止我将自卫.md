[Report from Our Newspaper in Handan, 4th] The situation in northern Henan is extremely tense due to the Kuomintang army's active preparations for attack. The large-scale joint land and air exercises of Chiang's troops in various parts of northern Henan, which began on the 22nd of last month, have not stopped to this day. The troops of the Kuomintang 31st Army Group stationed in Xinxiang even conducted a full-scale offensive exercise on the 28th and carried out various combat mobilizations. On the 30th, the army continued to conduct large-scale live ammunition exercises in the east and west suburbs of the city, and senior officials from the First War Zone Command were sent to encourage and inspect. From the 29th, passenger trains from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang have been suspended. Thirty tanks transported eastward from Xi'an arrived in Xinxiang on the 29th. The Kuomintang 53rd Division and the puppet troops of Wei Ansheng, Zhang Bohua, and Fan Dengke, etc., entrenched in 35 villages including Ji (Yuan), Meng (County), Baipo, Yezhen, and Potou in northern Henan, have also been building pillbox fortifications and actively preparing to attack the liberated areas in northern Henan and southern Shanxi. On the 17th, the unit transported a large number of military cement from Henan and forcibly requisitioned 60,000 pieces of bluestone from the local masses per bao (unit of measurement) for construction purposes. Currently, 120 pillboxes have been built in the 35 villages in the area (including those built in the past), 1,162 civilian houses have been demolished for bricks and tiles, 15,200 trees have been forcibly requisitioned from the masses, and the military grain extorted from the masses has reached 3.5 million jin. The suffering local masses are demanding that the Eighth Route Army carry out self-defense.
[Report from Our Newspaper in Handan, 6th] On July 5th, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region received a memorandum from the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters on July 1st to the Peiping Military Mediation Executive Department, which was arrogant and unreasonable, demanding that our army withdraw from Dongming City and the large liberated area between the city and Kaocheng before 12:00 on June 30th; otherwise, the Kuomintang army would not be responsible for all consequences. This memorandum is a direct step by the Kuomintang army to launch a large-scale civil war offensive against our liberated areas in northern Henan, southern Hebei, and western Shandong, and is clearly provocative. At the same time, all passenger cars on the Ping-Han Railway between Zhengzhou and Xinxiang have been converted to military transport, and large quantities of military supplies and Kuomintang troops have been continuously moving north in recent days. The Kuomintang army originally stationed in northern Henan has been carrying out joint land and air offensive exercises since June 22nd. A strong atmosphere of war has permeated Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, and other places, and a major war is about to break out. Our representative in the Xinxiang Group has formally notified the Kuomintang side of this unreasonable and provocative behavior, demanding that it be stopped immediately; otherwise, our army will have no choice but to be forced to defend itself.

　　豫北弥漫浓厚战争气氛
    蒋军亟图进攻解放区
    各地蒋伪军陆空大演习拆毁民房修筑碉堡
    我代表正告新乡小组倘不制止我将自卫
    【本报邯郸四日电】在国民党军积极准备进攻下，豫北形势，已万分紧张。从上月二十二开始之豫北各地蒋军陆空大演习，自今仍未停止。驻新乡之国民党三十一集团军所部，更于二十八日全部进行进攻演习，并举行各种战斗动员。三十日，该军复于城郊东西两处，继续进行大规模实弹演习，第一战区长官部并派遣高级官员前往鼓励检阅。从二十九日起，郑州至新乡之火车已停止客运。由西安东运之战车三十辆，已于二十九日运抵新乡。盘踞豫北济（源）孟（县）白坡、冶戍、坡头等三十五村的国民党军五十三师，及伪军卫安生、张伯华、范登科等部，近亦大修碉堡工事，积极准备向豫北、晋南两解放区进攻。十七日，该部已由河南运至大批军用洋灰，并向当地群众每保强征青石六万块，以供修筑之用。现该区三十五村中，已修成碉堡一百二十座（过去修筑在内），拆用民房砖瓦一千一百六十二间，强征群众树木一万五千二百株，群众被索之军粮，即达三百五十万斤。痛苦不堪的当地群众，纷纷要求八路军进行自卫。
    【本报邯郸六日电】晋冀鲁豫军区于七月五日接获郑州绥署七月一日致北平军事调处执行部备忘录一份，措辞狂妄无理，要求我军于六月三十日十二时以前退出东明城及该城至考城间之大块解放区，不然，发生一切后果，国民党军概不负责。这一备忘录即是国民党军向我豫北、冀南、鲁西解放区发动大规模内战进攻的直接步骤，显有挑衅作用。与此同时，平汉路上郑州至新乡间之客车全部改为军运，大批军火与国民党军连日来源源北开，原驻豫北之国民党军，自六月二十二日起，先后实施陆空军配合进攻演习，郑州新乡等地已弥漫浓厚战争气氛，大战即将爆发。新乡小组我方代表，业已对国方此种无理要求挑衅行为，向该小组提出正告，要求立予制止，否则我军只得被迫自卫。
