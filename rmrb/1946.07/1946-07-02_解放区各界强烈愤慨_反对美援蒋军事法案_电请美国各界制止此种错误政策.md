Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 27th: People from all walks of life in Yan'an held a symposium on current affairs at the Foreign Affairs Office on the 25th. At the meeting, everyone expressed indignation at the recent US State Department's submission to Congress of a bill to continue military aid to China, saying that this move would fuel the expansion of China's civil war and affect China's national independence, which is unanimously opposed by the Chinese people. It was immediately decided to send a telegram to all sectors of the United States, appealing to stop the passage of this bill. The original telegram is as follows:

To President Truman of the United States, Acting Speaker of the Senate McNary, Speaker of the House Rayburn, Chairman of the National Citizens Political Action Committee, Ping Sheng, Chairman of the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations of the United States, Hillman, Chairman of the National Committee for Peace, Carlson, Mr. Delacy of the Far Eastern Policy Committee, Mr. Sabath of the Congressional Committee for Peace:

The "Bill for Continued Military Aid to China" submitted by the US State Department to Congress on the 14th of this month provides assistance and encouragement to the Kuomintang government, which is persisting in dictatorship and civil war today, and poses a serious threat to China's peace, democracy, and independence. The Chinese people do not want to see themselves thrown into the abyss of disaster after experiencing a long and arduous struggle for liberation. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this unfriendly measure that harms the peaceful and democratic interests of the people of both China and the United States. We hope that the US authorities will withdraw this bill, and we appeal to all sectors of the American people to immediately stand up and stop the passage of this bill!

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 29th: Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's statement against the US authorities' implementation of the military aid to China bill, which fuels China's civil war, has received universal support and response from the people of the liberated areas. The Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Assembly has issued a telegram on behalf of the 40 million people in the border region, endorsing Chairman Mao's statement. The telegram stated: The US authorities' proposal to continue implementing the military aid to China bill is a clear manifestation of more actively supporting the Chinese oligarchic dictatorial government in implementing a policy of civil war, so as to make China a sphere of influence of the United States. Our 40 million compatriots in the border region, who have survived hardships, express extreme shock and indignation at this, and will make every effort to oppose the implementation of the bill. The Chahar Provincial Government also issued this telegram, pointing out that the US authorities' erroneous policy of military aid to Chiang is essentially armed interference in China's internal affairs and damage to China's independence and sovereignty, and called on compatriots across the country and the American people to unite and oppose this unjust act of interference, and safeguard peace in China and the Far East.

　　解放区各界强烈愤慨
    反对美援蒋军事法案
    电请美国各界制止此种错误政策
    【新华社延安二十七日电】延安各方面人士于二十五日假交际处召开时事座谈会，会上大家对最近美国国务院提付国会的继续对华军事援助法案表示愤慨，并谓：此举将助长中国内战的扩大，影响到中国国家的独立地位，为中国人民所一致反对。当即决议电美国各方面发出呼吁，制止通过此种法案，原电如次：
    美国杜鲁门总统、参议院代议长麦克纳尔、众议院院长雷朋、全国公民政治行动委员会主席平生、美国产业工会联合会政治行动委员会主席希尔曼、全国争取和平委员会主席卡尔逊、远东政策委员会德拉西先生，国会争取和平委员会萨巴兹先生：
    本月十四日，美国国务院提付国会的“继续对华军事援助法案”，对于今天坚持独裁、坚持内战的国民党政府给了帮助和鼓励，而对于中国的和平民主与独立，则形成严重的威胁。中国人民不愿看到在其自身经历长久和艰苦奋斗获得解放，又被抛入灾难的深沟中。中国人民坚决反对这种对中美两国人民的和平民主利益都有损害的非友谊的措施，我们希望美国当局撤回这一法案，我们并向美国各界人民呼吁，立即起来制止这一法案的通过！
    【新华社延安二十九日电】中共中央毛主席关于反对美国当局实施军事援华法案，助长中国内战的声明，得到了解放区各界人民普遍的拥护与响应。晋察冀边区参议会，顷代表该边区四千万人民发表通电，拥护毛主席的声明。通电中称：美当局提出继续实施对华军事援助法案，实为更积极地支持中国寡头专制政府，实行内战政策之一个明证，以使中国成为美国之势力范围。我边区四千万同胞患难余生，对此极表骇异愤恨，将以一切努力反对该案之实施。察哈尔省府亦发表是项通电，指出美国当局错误的军事援蒋政策，实质上就是武装干涉中国内政与损害中国的独立与主权，并号召全国同胞及美国人民一致团结起来，反对这种不正义干涉行为，保障中国与远东和平。
