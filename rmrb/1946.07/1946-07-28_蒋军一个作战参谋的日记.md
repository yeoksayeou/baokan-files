Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd - The Northeast Democratic Allied Army seized the diary of Yang ××, an operations staff officer of the 87th Division of the Kuomintang's 71st Army, during the self-defense battle of Jinjiabao. It recounts the Kuomintang army's experience of being driven to the Northeast to engage in civil war, how they endured the arrogance of the Americans, and their doubts about the outbreak of the civil war. Below is the full text of his diary:

    March 1st: It's raining. I didn't go out. I spent the whole day reading newspapers to pass the time. It says that tomorrow I will leave this place for Shanghai and then to the Northeast. When will I be able to return to Jiangnan, to the "paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below"? Thinking of this, I can't help but feel a sense of loss!

    March 8th: Because our work is disorganized and things are not going smoothly, Battalion Commander Zhu and I were lectured by the division commander in an official tone, and also with the arrogance of the high-noses (referring to the Americans). I felt very depressed all day.

    March 15th: It rained all day. Originally, I planned to load all the weapons, ammunition, equipment, and clothing of the division stationed at the dock onto the ship today. But it's all because our troops (1) are not serious in their work, (2) the communication is not accurate, and two grenades were found in the document box by people (the Americans), (3) plus the high-noses despise the Chinese mentality, turning nothing into something, and turning small things into big things. As a result, the whole city was in an uproar, and the 71st Army was completely stopped from being transported. A telegram was sent to Chairman Chiang reporting the incident. Finally, the deputy division commander and deputy army commander put on a lot of smiling faces (note: the appearance of a slave), but still to no avail.

    March 16th (note: an agreement has been reached with the foreign masters to allow transportation): I packed my luggage and sent it to the dock for loading, greeted the troops to enter the station, disinfected, inspected—until the officers and soldiers boarded the ship and surrendered their weapons (note: Kuomintang soldiers were not allowed to carry weapons on American ships. The Americans confiscated and sealed them, and returned them after landing), packed under the command of the foreign ×. Everything was done without the twists and turns of yesterday. I heard that our superiors gave bribes this morning. Poor China! Despicable foreign gentlemen...

    March 17th: I sleep on the upper bunk of the hammock. Every day I have the opportunity to practice on the iron bars, which is also good. There are only a few people in the room: the chief of staff, the regimental commander, the deputy regimental commander, the regimental adjutant, two translators, and me. Although it can't be said to be how good it is, it is worlds apart from the brothers in the same cabin who are "wet, crowded, and smelly." ...Probably because the foreign devils saw that our officers carried Japanese pistols and sabers, which caused a few guys to walk in and out of our room, "gibbering" without results, and then ran to the door to gesture to our guards, wanting to use the woolen hats on their heads to exchange for the pistols hanging on the wall. We ignored them... Perhaps they were ashamed and angry, so they asked the translator to tell us that there were no canvas beds, the light bulbs could not be used, and the flushing toilet was broken and could not be repaired. It seemed to say: If you don't bring that thing here, we have a way to deal with you. As a result, several of our officers and staff officers had to squeeze together with the soldiers when they went to the toilet.

    March 20th: My head hurts so much that I can't even hold a pen to write, let alone have the energy to unbutton my clothes to sleep. Based on yesterday's lesson, I put a basin next to me in advance, in case I really feel chest discomfort and throat itching, ready for emergencies. But I don't know that everyone in the entire room is like this. The entire cabin has almost become a field hospital, the only difference is that there are no nurses to embellish it. Lying in the bunk, I let my body follow the rhythm of the waves under the bottom of the boat, swinging back and forth like a swing. Sometimes I couldn't help it, so I had to bite my lips and resign myself to fate. To eat a few cold bread without boiling water to swallow, to wear a man-made wool coat that cannot keep warm... This is called "wearing foreign clothes, carrying foreign guns, eating foreign food, sitting on foreign boats, and suffering foreign sins." Namo Amitabha!

    March 22nd: After several nights of shocks, I slept more comfortably last night. I felt very good when I got up, and I heard that the ship would arrive at Qinhuangdao at 1:00 pm today. After being disarmed for four days and being a prisoner for four days, I will be free in a few hours. I was so happy that I climbed onto the deck in one breath, watching the motherland's rivers and mountains slowly move in front of me; but the foreign masters dropped anchor in the sea not far away, which made people feel anxious. Then, some pirate-like American sailors came and, for the sake of cleaning the cabin, waved their fists at your nose in the same manner as Muhammad preaching, with a broom in his left hand and a fist in his right. Under this kind of coercion, many of our officers suffered humiliation. Originally, I wanted to "pay back tooth for tooth" and "reciprocity demands," but I still put forward a protest through diplomatic channels. As a result, the protest was just a protest, and it ended without a result. Here, thousands of officers and soldiers, holding full of resentment, swallowed the nameless anger and stepped onto the dock. After arriving at the camp, Adjutant Director Zhizhong told me that nine Mauser pistols from the ordnance department had been stolen from the boxes by American sailors, and two machine guns had also been stolen. The eiderdown quilts from the quartermaster department were torn, and twenty sacks were stolen. After negotiations, eight sacks were returned.

    April 3rd: I heard that the road we are walking today has entered the "Liberated Area"... In the morning, the troops set off... Immediately ordered to camp, received battle reports from the telephones of each regiment, considered the situation, and planned to occupy Faku tomorrow.

    April 10th: Last year, two fought one (referring to the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation against Japan), this year, two fought each other. If they don't fight, they won't rot, and they fight for foreigners to watch. Why do they have to boil beans to make soup and use the beanstalk to burn under them? In the human world, an unfathomable mystery!

　　蒋军一个作战参谋的日记
    【新华社延安二十三日电】东北民主联军于金家堡自卫战中缴获国民党七十一军八十七师作战参谋扬××的日记，其中历述国民党军被驱使到东北进行内战的经过，和如何忍受美国人的气，以及对内战发生的怀疑等。下面是他的日记全文。
    三月一日：落雨，没有出去，终日看报消遣，说明天就要离开此地到上海去，到东北去，几时才能回到江南，回到“上有天堂下有苏杭”的苏杭？想到此，不胜怅然若失！
    三月八日：为着我们工作没有头绪，事情办不通，朱营长和我遭了师长一顿官腔，并且外加高鼻子（按指美国人）的洋气，整天闷人的很。
    三月十五日：整天落雨，原拟今天将师所有停置码头之械弹、器材、被服装好上船，却只怪自己部队（一）作事不认真，（二）连络不确实，公文箱中被人家（美国人）发现两颗手榴弹，（三）再加上高鼻子轻视中国的心理，无事变成有事，小事变成大事，结果呢，满城风雨，硬要把七十一军完全停运。拍电报给委员长报呈经过，最后出动了副师长副军长陪了很多笑脸（按：奴才相），仍无结果。
    三月十六日（按：已和洋大人商妥允运了）：将自己行李捆好送上码头装载、招呼部队进站、消毒、检查——直到官兵上船、缴械（按：国民党军上美舰不许携带武器，由美人将其收缴封存，登陆后再发还），捆装在唯命是从的洋×下，各样作得不像昨天那样的纠角横生。听说今早我们的上官已给送贿了，可怜的中国！可鄙的洋先生……
    三月十七日：我睡的是吊床的上层，每天有得机会练习点铁杠，也是好的。房间仅有参谋长、团长、副团长、团附、两个译官和我几个人，虽不能说怎么好，但比起同舱里的弟兄们“湿一挤二臭三”来，真有天地之别。……大概是洋鬼子看见我们官长带有日本手枪和战刀的缘故，以致惹起几个家伙在我们房间穿进穿出，“叽哩咕噜”无结果，便跑到门口向我们卫兵打手式，想用头上的绒线帽子来换壁上挂着的手枪。我们相应不理……或者他们恼羞成怒了吧，便叫译官向我们说帆布床没有了，电灯泡不能用，抽水马桶也坏了，不能修理。似乎讲：不把那东西拿来，我们有办法。以致我们几个官长参谋长大便时也只得和士兵挤在一块。
    三月二十日：头痛得简直要命，莫说握笔写字，连睡觉解扣子精神都没有了。基于昨天的教训，预先将个盆儿放在身边，万一真的胸潮喉痒，准备不时之需。殊不知整个房间人人如此，满舱几乎成了野战医院，所差的就是没有看护小姐点缀其间罢了。躺在铺里让自己的身子紧随着船底波涛起伏的节奏，如秋千样荡来荡去，有时忍不住了，也只得咬紧嘴唇听天由命而已。要吃几个冷面包没有开水咽下，要穿一件人造毛的大衣保不住暖……这就叫作“穿洋衣、扛洋枪、吃洋饭、坐洋船、受洋罪”了。南无阿弥陀佛！
    三月二十二日：几晚间的震荡，独昨夜睡的比较舒适。起床后精神很好，而且听说今天下午一时船将到达秦皇岛靠岸，解了四天武装，作了四天囚犯，没有几个钟头要恢复自由了，解放了，便欢喜的什么似的一气爬上甲板，眼看着祖国的河山慢慢儿移到面前；却被洋大人在不远不近的海中投下锚，真叫人心急得梗在喉咙里。接着，一些海盗似的美国水手走来，为了打扫船舱的事，竟像穆罕默德传教一样左手提着扫把，右手将拳头挥在你的鼻子上。在这种淫威下，使我们不少的官长受尽了侮辱。本来是想“以牙还牙”、“来而不往非礼也”给以当头一棒，但仍然循外交方式提出抗议，结果抗议不过抗议，还是不了了之。在此官兵上下千百个人，怀着满腔愤恨，咽下那无名的仇火，步上码头。抵达营地后，副官主任志忠告诉我：军械处的盒子枪被美国水手破箱偷去九支，又偷去了机枪两挺，军需处的鸭绒被子遭划破，麻袋偷去了二十床，经交涉退还了八床。
    四月三日：闻今日所走之路已进入“解放区”……晨，部队起程……旋即下令宿营，接收各团电话之战报，考虑情况，筹划明日攻占法库。
    四月十日：去年两个打一个（按指国共合作打日本），今年两个互相打，不打不得烂，打给外人看，为什么要这样箕豆相煎？人世间猜不透的谜儿！
