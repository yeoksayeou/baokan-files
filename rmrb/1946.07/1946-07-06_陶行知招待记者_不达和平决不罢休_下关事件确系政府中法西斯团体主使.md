Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Shanghai News: "Chiang Kai-shek has a complex psychology that makes him believe that everyone who wants peace and democracy is a 'Communist'." Tao Xingzhi, spokesperson for the Shanghai People's Organizations United Association for Peace, made the above insightful conclusion at a reception for foreign journalists at the International Hotel last month on the 25th, regarding the Xiaguan massacre in Nanjing. Tao said: "We certainly know that the organized beating of peace representatives in Nanjing was instigated by a bellicose fascist group within the government. These people can only maintain their power through war. The democratic movement and the peace movement are directly opposed to their ambitions." Tao believes that "this beating is consistent with the way students are treated in Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, and elsewhere. The reactionary forces have turned the Three People's Principles into fascism, and they cannot shirk their responsibility for this fact." Tao demanded that the United States stop all aid to the Kuomintang government, immediately withdraw the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in China, and that the American people assist the Chinese people in eradicating fascism in China. He said: "Continued U.S. support for the Kuomintang authorities will only lead to a continued expansion of the civil war. We believe that if they are not so encouraged, the civil war will certainly stop." Tao stated: "The people's task is to only allow success and not allow failure. If they do not achieve peace, they will not rest, and if they fail, others will be sent to replace them until lasting peace is realized." Tao firmly stated: "We need true peace and democracy. Regardless of this beating, we will persevere until democracy and peace descend upon China. We will fight for democracy, because without democracy, there is no peace to speak of."

    不达和平决不罢休
    下关事件确系政府中法西斯团体主使
    【新华社延安二日电】沪讯：“蒋介石有一种复杂的心理，这种心理使他相信每个想要和平与民主的人，都是‘共产党’”。沪市各界争取和平联合会发言人陶行知，上月廿五日为南京下关惨案在国际饭店外籍记者招待会上发表上述警辟结语。陶氏说：“我们确实知道，在南京对和平的代表有组织的殴打，是政府中一种好战的法西斯团体所主使，这种人只有借着战争，才能保留动力。民主运动及和平运动，正与他们的野心对立”。陶氏认为“这次的殴打，是与在昆明、重庆、成都以及其他地方对待学生的方法是一贯的相同的，反动的力量将三民主义变为法西斯主义，对此事实责无旁贷”。陶氏要求美国停止对国民党政府的一切援助，立即撤退驻华的美海陆空军，并要美国人民援助中国人民铲除中国的法西斯。他说：“美国继续不断的支持国民党当局，只能使内战继续扩大。我们相信如果他们不被这样鼓励，内战一定会停止”。陶氏称：“人民的任务是只许成功，不许失败，如果不争取到和平，他们决不会罢休，假若他们失败了，其他的人要派去代替他们，一直到永远的和平实现”。陶氏坚决表示：“我们需要真正的和平与民主，不管这次被打，我们要坚持到民主及和平降临中国，我们要为民主而斗争，因为没有民主，谈不到和平”。
