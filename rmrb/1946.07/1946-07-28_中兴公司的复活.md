　　The Revival of the Zhongxing Company
    Ruò Wàng
    The Zhongxing Company in Zaozhuang is a modernized small city. It boasts a garden, a cinema with a capacity of 2,000 people, a library with relatively complete scientific knowledge, the "Ju Ren Hospital" with over 200 beds, a large-scale bathhouse (with eight pools), and the Zhongxing Middle and Primary School (with a total of over 1,400 students). This small city has a population of sixty to seventy thousand people, and its residences are all Western-style houses equipped with modern facilities such as running water, heating pipes, electric stoves, and refrigerators. The Nanda Well Mine in Zaozhuang is located within the Zhongxing Company. The towering coal unloading machine and the two large chimneys of the power plant stand side by side against the clouds. The entire plant has five generators, with a power generation capacity of 11,200 kilowatts. The machinery department is large in scale and capable of manufacturing various machines.
    During the occupation of the puppet army and traitor Wang Jimei, this beautiful small city suffered brutal devastation, becoming a nest for attacking the people, a gloomy hell on earth. It accumulated the excrement of more than 10,000 people for five months, piled up more than 3,500 carts of garbage and coal ash, the stench filled the air, and more than one-third of the employees and their families suffered from dysentery. The electricity was used exclusively for the power grid, and employees were forced to build fortifications and sandbags, receiving only two pounds of moldy and rotten black beans per day.
    June 9th was the day of the Zhongxing Company's revival. Many employees who were so hungry they could barely open their eyes and so sick they could barely move jumped up happily and said, "The Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army have arrived, now we can see the sun!" The day after liberation, the democratic government, in collaboration with the Zaozhuang Workers' Union, went to the Zhongxing Company to comfort the suffering workers, distributing 140,000 yuan of local currency (20 yuan per legal currency), more than 3,000 catties of grain, and providing emergency medical care to more than 4,000 workers and their families. The Ju Ren Hospital was reopened, and the first batch treated more than 200 patients. At the same time, the Workers' Union mobilized the employees to systematically remove garbage, which was all loaded onto trains and transported away. Technicians, staff, and all employees and their families voluntarily participated enthusiastically. More than 3,000 people cleared more than 3,000 tons of garbage in five days.
    Before the establishment of the Mine Restoration Committee, the machinery and administration departments first started work, oiling the machines, putting on belts, and starting the lathes to repair parts and tools. The employees were extremely excited to return to the machines they loved, unanimously grateful for the proper protection of the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army during the fighting, which prevented the machines from being damaged in the slightest.
    After the establishment of the Mine Restoration Committee, the plan was to first start the ventilation fans of the three major wells, and then start the electric water pumps to drain the water. Because the Beida Well was severely flooded, the original four water pumps had been submerged, so a large water pump needed to be manufactured to replace them. It was also necessary to seize the time to repair the drainage machines of the three wells before the rainy season arrived. The tasks facing the Mine Restoration Committee were enormous. In order to complete this arduous task, all kinds of machines were put into operation. The Director of the Mine Restoration Committee and Chief Engineer Ke Like personally directed the work process in the machine room. An electric water pump for the Dongda Well had fifty to sixty kinds of parts of various sizes, which were distributed to various lathes for repair or blacksmith furnaces for re-casting. Planers, drills, and riveting machines were all put into operation, jointly manufacturing a large shaft for an electric water pump. Fourteen of the seventeen iron and copper furnaces were lit. More than forty sets of parts of various sizes were repaired within a week. The Manchester-style pneumatic hammer was hammering the huge components for the electric water pump. More than seventy workers in the assembly department were splitting open three-inch thick iron plates, welding and building two electric water pumps capable of storing fifteen tons of water each, for use in draining the Beida Well. Electric sawmills and planing machines were also working intensely. The workers in the locomotive repair shop were transporting the twenty-sixth locomotive from the ferry in order to disassemble and repair it. This enormous factory was like an organic whole, with each part moving in an orderly manner under an overall plan. The sound of steel friction and the noise of machines spread melodiously. The stagnant mines and suffocating small cities have now all been rescued and revived.

　　中兴公司的复活
    若望
    枣庄的中兴公司是一近代化的小城市，它拥有一个花园，一个可容两千人的电影院，一个科学知识比较完备的图书馆，一个能容二百余病床的“鞠仁医院”，一个规模巨大的澡堂（设有八个池子），一个中兴中学和小学（学生共一千四百余人）。这个小城市的人却有六七万，他的住宅一律都是洋房，有自来水暖气管、电炉冰箱等现代化设备。枣庄的南大井矿就在中兴公司里头，巍峨的卸煤机和发电厂的两个大烟囱并排的耸立在云际，全厂有五部发电机，发电量达一万一千二百基罗瓦特。机务处规模宏大，能自造各种机器。
    在伪军王逆继美盘踞期间，这个美丽的小城市遭受了横暴的摧残，沦为进攻人民的巢穴，阴森森的人间地狱，那里积存了一万多人五个月来的排泄物，堆聚了三千五百多车垃圾和煤屑，臭气冲天，职工和家属有三分之一以上患痢疾。电力被专用于电网，职工被驱使去筑工事垒沙包，每人每天只发二斤霉烂的黑豆。
    六月九日，这是中兴公司复活的一天，许多饿得眼睛睁不开病得不能动弹的职工，都高兴的跳起来说：“八路军新四军来了这下可见到太阳了。”解放后第二天，民主政府即协同枣庄职工会去中兴公司慰问受难工友，发放本币十四万元（每元合法币二十元），粮食三千余斤，急救四千余职工及其家属，重开鞠仁医院，首批即诊治二百余名病人；同时职工会并动员职工有组织的清除垃圾，都装上火车运走，技师、职员及全体职工和家属都自动地踊跃参加，三千多人在五天内即清除垃圾三千余吨。
    在复矿委员会尚未成立以前，机务政务两处即首先开工，给机器添油上皮带，开动旋床修理零件及工具。职工们重新回到自己所热爱的机器跟前兴奋异常，一致感激八路军新四军在战斗中妥善保护，使机器未受丝毫损害。
    复矿委员会成立后，计划首先开动三个大井的通风机，然后开电力抽水机抽水，北大井因水淹较严重，原有四个抽水机已被淹没，故需自制一架大抽水机来修替，又必需争取时间在雨季到来前即修好三个井的排水机。摆在复矿委员会面前的任务是巨大的，为了完成这个艰巨的任务，各式机器都转动起来了，复矿委员会长兼总工程师克里柯亲自在机房里指示工作的程序。一个东大井的电力抽水机共有五六十种大小零件，已分发给各种旋床修理或铁匠炉另打，刨床、钻床、钉床都动工了，合制一个电力抽水机上的大轴，十七座铁铜炉已有十四座生火，一周内即修理大小零件四十余套，曼彻斯特式的气锤，正在锤打电力抽水机用的巨大机件。装配部七十多名工人，正在将三寸厚的铁板拚开，焊接打两个能存十五吨水的电力抽水机，以供北大井抽水之用。电动锯木机和刨杆机也都在紧张地工作，机车修理房的工人们，正在将第二十六大车头从渡车上运进来，以便拆卸重修，这座庞大的工厂像是有机的整体，每个部分都在一个总的计划下井然有序地活动着。钢铁的磨擦声，机器的噪音，悠扬地传播着，停动的矿井室息的小城市现均已经得救苏生了。
