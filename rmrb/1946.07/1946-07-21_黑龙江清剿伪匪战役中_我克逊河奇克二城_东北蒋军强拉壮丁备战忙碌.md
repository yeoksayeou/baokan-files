Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, 17th: In the campaign to suppress counter-revolutionary bandits in Heilongjiang, the North An Democratic Allied Army recently captured Xunhe and Qike, two cities on the border that had been occupied by counter-revolutionary bandits. Over 80 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded and over 20 captured. The remnants have fled into the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and our army is continuing to pursue and suppress them.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th: (Delayed dispatch) The Kuomintang army in various parts of the Northeast is collecting grain and forcibly conscripting men in preparation for a new offensive. The situation on the banks of the Songhua River is becoming increasingly tense. On the 3rd and 4th, two trains arrived from Changchun, loaded with steel plates, sacks, rubber boats, etc. All ships along the river have been taken under the control of the Kuomintang army and are moored on the south bank of the Songhua River, appearing ready to advance north at any time. The New 22nd Division, originally stationed in Changchun, was transferred east to the La (fa) Yong (ji) line in late June, and two regiments of the 88th Division also advanced to the southeast area of ​​Laoye Ridge. At present, the Kuomintang army has completed all the blockhouses along the more than ten-mile stretch of the Songhua River near Jilin. Furthermore, the Kuomintang's 195th Division in Meihekou and Hailong has begun seizing vehicles since June 30th and is also scouting our Liuhe and Jinchuan areas. Another dispatch states: The Northeast Security Commander's Office recently established the so-called "Supplementary Recruitment Supervision Committee," with an initial quota of 60,000 people. Near Jilin, a major household registration investigation is underway, forcing young men between the ages of 20 and 30 to enlist. On the 2nd of this month, Zheng Dongguo also gathered leaders from all walks of life in Changchun to establish the so-called "Youth Indefinite Training Camp Preparatory Committee," planning to conscript 3,000 people. Currently, 2,000 people in Changchun will be forced to enter the camp on August 1st, and large numbers of young students are fleeing to the countryside and our liberated areas.
