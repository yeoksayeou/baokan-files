　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Moscow Radio broadcast on the 3rd: Commentator Masinu, in his commentary on the ninth anniversary of the "July 7th Incident," pointed out that the Chinese mass movement had guaranteed the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, the victory of the War of Resistance did not bring peace to the Chinese people, and the Chinese national revival plan that began with the War of Resistance was once again sabotaged. China faces the danger of regressing decades, thus triggering a nationwide mass movement to strive for peace and democracy and oppose civil war. Masinu cited the example of Shanghai representatives going to Nanjing to petition and quoted an Associated Press reporter's report that the leaders of the peace delegation declared to Chiang Kai-shek that if the government started a civil war, the people would suffer huge disasters, and the mass movement would be in full swing and unstoppable. Masinu exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' insistence on a civil war policy, stating: The Kuomintang reactionaries have openly declared that they want to eliminate the Communist Party, and Du Yuming has declared that they must take over all of Manchuria. On June 28, at the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee meeting, the reactionaries more firmly opposed extending the ceasefire. Masinu then pointed out: Chinese social figures generally believe that the precondition for establishing long-term peace in China is to stop foreign interference in China's internal affairs. If it were not for the help of the United States, the Chinese reactionaries would not dare to engage in open activities. However, the Chinese reactionaries' attempts have met with the firm opposition of millions of ordinary Chinese people, who, after the victory of the civil war and the War of Resistance Against Japan, have awakened to fight for a free and democratic New China. The Chinese Communist Party and other democratic parties have developed into a powerful force. The Chinese progressive forces have been consolidated in recent years and are strong enough to resist new offensives from international and domestic reactionary forces. Hundreds of millions of people around the world are standing on the position of peace and democracy, which gives Chinese democrats confidence in their optimistic future. International reactionaries have no possibility of stopping the progress of the developing progressive forces of the Chinese people.

　　马西努论“七七事变”九年
    美国纵蒋扩大内战中国遭遇巨大危险
    但进步力量强大，足以对抗国内外反动派新进攻。
    【新华社延安三日电】莫斯科三日广播：评论员马西努论“七七事变”九周年，指出中国群众运动曾保证了抗战的胜利，但抗战胜利后，并没有为中国人带来和平，抗日战争所开始的中国民族复兴计划，又遭受了破坏，中国有倒退几十年的危险，因此引起了争取和平民主、反对内战的全国性的群众运动的兴起。马西努以上海代表赴南京请愿为例，并引美联社记者报导和平代表团领导人向蒋介石声明，如果政府爆发内战，人民将遭受巨大灾难，而民众运动将如火如荼的不可遏止。马西努揭露国民党反动派坚持内战政策称：国民党反动派曾公开声明要消灭共产党，杜聿明则声明非接收全部满洲不可。六月二十八日，国民党中常会上，反动派更坚决反对延长停战。马西努接着指出：中国社会人士咸认建立中国长期和平的先决条件，是停止外人干涉中国内政，中国反动分子如果不是美国的帮助，他们是不敢公开活动的。但中国反动派的企图，已遇到中国千百万普通人的坚决反对，他们经过内战及抗战的胜利，已经觉醒他们为自由民主的新中国而斗争。中共及其他民主党派已发展成为强大力量，中国进步力量最近几年已巩固起来，足以对抗国际与国内反动势力的新进攻。全世界成千成万的人民，都已站在和平民主的岗位上，这使中国民主人士对其乐观的未来有了信心。国际反动派没有可能阻挡发展中的中国人民的进步力量。
