Kuomintang Areas' Economy Rapidly Becoming Colonialized
	Qian Tang
	The American reactionaries' economic policy towards China serves its imperialist aims. U.S. Treasury Secretary Vinson openly stated in the House of Representatives on May 15: "Seventy-five percent of world trade lies within the Anglo-American zone... We hope to expand this trade to more than seventy-five percent." (U.S. News Service, May 15)
	In fact, the reason why American reactionaries are using armed intervention in China's internal affairs is precisely because they want to turn China into a colony, to extract super-profits from the flesh and blood of the Chinese people. As the American New Masses magazine said last December: "Our (referring to the U.S.) government is carrying out that ugly task for our greedy imperialists. They want to make China a disintegrated, weakened, and semi-colonial country. This would fulfill the orders of American trusts, such as Standard Oil. It should be known that former Ambassador Hurley was a major oil merchant." "Our government serves the bankers and industrialists who became rich during the war in America, managing and ruling various parts of the world for them, and they need to manage China."
	For this purpose, the United States first expanded its exports to China. Before the war, U.S. exports to China accounted for only about 2.5 percent of its total exports. Now it plans to expand to 20 percent, requiring an eight- or nine-fold increase in exports to China. (Masses, Vol. 11, Issue 5)
	Currently, American goods have begun to flood into China like a landslide, even resorting to blatant smuggling tactics. (There are five main routes for smuggled goods: first, foreign merchant sailors smuggling; second, Allied forces—navy ships and military aircraft personnel smuggling; third, Hong Kong and India using airplanes to smuggle diamonds, etc.; fourth, cloth packages sent from abroad smuggling; fifth, professional smugglers bringing goods from other places.) "Customs cannot inspect warships, so sailors use warships to carry goods. This is almost the same as armed smuggling." (Shanghai United Daily Evening Edition, June 15) The most important and vicious tool to help American goods enter unhindered is the recent opening of the four inland ports of Jing, Wu, Xun, and Han, and the fact that the posts of the Inspector General of Customs and the Commissioner of Customs of Jianghai Customs have been completely taken over by foreigners. The post of Inspector General of Customs had already been taken by the American, L. T. Daniel, and the post of Commissioner of Customs of Jianghai Customs was recently changed from the Chinese, Ding Gui ×, to the Englishman, B.R. Pryde.
	The Central Bank's power to manage foreign exchange also helps American monopolistic capitalists' commodities enter China because bureaucratic comprador capital can obtain foreign exchange as it pleases.
	Chinese comprador bureaucratic capital and American imperialist elements have organized countless import and export companies, such as Kong Xiangxi's son's Yangtze Construction Company (with capital reaching 500 million US dollars), Soong Tzu-wen and Soong Tzu-liang's import and export trading company, Jinshan Company, Lida Company, and the Sino-American Industrial Company jointly established by American Air Force officer Chennault and Chinese compradors. All of these are the main brokers for the import of American goods.
	This has created the most favorable conditions for the import of American imperialist goods, which will flood the Chinese market.
	The means by which American financial capital groups colonize China are not only through the export of commodities, but also through the more sinister export of capital. New York has already established a fortress command headquarters for investment in China—the "Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association." Last year, it signed a larger plan with Chinese bureaucratic capital to invest in the Kuomintang, establish four mines and factories in China, build highways and railways, and dispatch experts to control the economic lifeline of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Recently, this plan is being actively implemented, and American oil, yarn, shipbuilding, electrical, chemical, cement and other factories will appear in China. In May, Truman sent a telegram to the Sino-American Industrial and Commercial Association, instructing: "In addition to banking and trade, merchants generally hope to develop in other businesses (referring to industry)."
	The promulgation and implementation of the new Company Law in April (effective from January 1 of this year) stipulate that "only those organized and registered under a special permit from a foreign government and operating within China are foreign companies." (Article 7) In fact, this treats the head office of a foreigner-established company in China as a Chinese company, and a foreign company is not required to operate in its home country. (Article 292) It only stipulates that it must be established and registered in its home country. It tolerates the economic entry of American monopolistic capital into China, refusing to accept the minimum restrictions advocated by people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas (such as foreign companies must operate in their home countries). It stipulates that "more than half of the directors and managing directors of share capital or joint-stock companies must have residences in the country." (Articles 32, 105, 126, 184, and 193) "There are no nationality restrictions for general managers, only the chairman of the board is required to be Chinese." (Article 193) In reality, this means that foreign monopolistic capital completely controls Chinese companies. In particular, it stipulates that "after a foreign company is licensed, its legal rights, obligations, and the jurisdiction of competent officials shall be the same as those of a Chinese company, unless otherwise stipulated by law." (Article 297) In fact, this not only recognizes the equal rights of foreign and Chinese companies but also opens the back door for foreign companies to obtain special privileges. Such a Company Law is meaningless; it is a hotbed arranged for the entry of American monopolistic capital into China.
	In short, the Kuomintang ruling group's policy of unconditionally welcoming the entry of American goods and capital will fully realize American imperialism's ambition and plan for economic aggression against China, and will put the Chinese nation in the face of an unprecedented danger of colonization. Moreover, this crisis has already begun seriously. (Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th)

　　国民党区经济急剧殖民地化
　　钱塘
    美国反动派的对华经济政策是服从于它的帝国主义目的的。美财长文森于五月十五日在众议院公开地说：“世界贸易百分之七十五在于英美区…………吾人乃希望其贸易扩大至百分之七十五以上”。（美国新闻处五月十五日电）
    事实上美国反动派所以武装干涉中国内政，正是因为他们要把中国变为殖民地，要在中国人民的血肉里面榨取超额利润。正如去年十二月美国新群众杂志所说的：“我们（指美国）政府为了我们贪婪的帝国主义分子而执行了那种丑恶的任务。他们要把中国成为一个分崩离析的、被削弱的、半殖民地的国家。这样就可以完成美国托拉斯，如美孚煤油公司的命令了。须知前任大使赫尔利就是一个大油商。”“我们的政府是为了美国在战争中暴富的银行家与工业家而服务，为他们从事世界各部分之管理与统治，他们需要管理中国”。
    为了这个目的，美国首先扩张它的对华输出。在战前，美国对我国的输出仅占它的总输出额的百分之二点五左右。现在它计划扩张到百分之二十，要求对华输出提高八九倍。（群众十一卷五期）
    目前美国商品已经开始排山倒海似的输至中国，甚至于采取公然走私的横暴手段。（私货的路线，主要有五条。一是外国商轮水手夹带。二是盟军——军舰及军用飞机人员夹带。三是香港印度诸方面利用飞机私运钻石等。四是国外寄来布包夹带。五是职业走私者自外地带来。）“海关不能检查军舰，水兵就利用军舰带货。这跟武装走私已经差不多了。”（六月十五日上海联合日报晚刊）最重要的和最凶恶的帮助美货长驱直入的利器是最近京、芜、浔、汉、四内港的开放，和全国总税务司和江海关税务司已完全掌握于外国人之手。全国总税务司早已为美国人李度丹特，江海关总税务司近又撤换华人丁贵×，改易英人百礼查担任。
    中央银行管理外汇的大权，也帮助了美国独占资本家的商品输华。因为官僚买办资本可以予取予求的获得外汇。
    中国买办官僚资本和美国帝国主义分子，纷纷的组织起无数的进出口公司，如孔祥熙之子的扬子建业公司，（资本达五万万美金）宋子文、宋子良的进出口贸易公司、金山公司、立达公司，及美国空军军官陈纳德与中国买办合办的中美实业公司等等，都是美货入口的主要掮客。
    这就为美国帝国主义的商品输入安排了最有利的条件，将使美国商品淹没中国市场。
    美国财政资本集团殖民地化中国的手段，不仅是商品输出，而且还有更毒辣的资本输出。纽约早已成立了一个对华投资的堡垒指挥部——“中美工商联合会”。去年已与中国官僚资本订立对国民党投资、和在华设立四矿厂、建立公路铁路、派遣专家等，控制国民党统治区经济命脉的更大计划。最近这个计划正在积极进行，将有美国的石油、纱厂、造船、电气、化学、水泥等工厂出现于中国。五月间，杜鲁门致电中美工商联合会指示说：“除银行业务与贸易外，一般商人希望在其他业务（按指工业）方面谋发展。”
    四月间新公司法的颁布与施行（本年一月一日起施行。）“仅以在外国政府特许组织登记，而在中国境内营业者，为外国公司。”（第七条）实即视外人在华设立总公司的公司为中国本公司，外国公司并可不在其本国营业。（第二百九十二条）仅规定在其本国设立登记。容忍了美国独占资本的公司，在经济上入主中国，拒绝接受国民党区人士所主张的最低的限制（如外国公司须在其本国营业。）规定股本或股份有限公司的董事、常务董事只“须有半数以上在国内有住所。”（第三十二、一零五、一二六、一八四、一九三各条）“总经理没有国籍限制，仅规定董事长须为华人。（第一九三条）实际上是实行外国独占资本完全掌握着中国的公司。尤其是规定“外国公司经认许后，其法律上之权利义务及主管官之管辖，除法律上另有规定外，与中国公司同。”（第二九七条）实际是不仅承认外国公司与中国公司的同等权利，而且为外国公司可获特权开了后门。这样的公司法毫无意义的，这是为美国独占资本的输入中国而安排下的温床。
    总之国民党统治集团的无条件欢迎美国的商品与资本输入的政策，将全盘实现美国帝国主义对华经济侵略的野心与计划，而使中国民族面临着空前的殖民地化的危险。而且这种危机已经严重的开始了。（新华社延安九日电）
