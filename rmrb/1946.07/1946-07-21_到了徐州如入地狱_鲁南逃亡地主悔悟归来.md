"Arriving in Xuzhou is Like Entering Hell"
Southern Shandong Landlords Who Fled Regret and Return
Xinhua News Agency, Teng County, 18th—More than 60 landlords from Teng County, Lincheng County, and other areas in Southern Shandong, including Qi Yuban and Zhang Jinle, were deceived by rumors spread by Kuomintang secret agents and fled to Xuzhou. Recently, they returned to the liberated areas with their families and expressed resentment about being deceived. Zhang Jinle's son said, "Those Kuomintang secret agents deserve to be torn to pieces! They made me flee to Xuzhou and suffer terribly. Renting a small room in Xuzhou costs more than 30,000 yuan in legal tender each month. Those without money had to live in thatched sheds, which leaked rain and let in wind. The whole family was crammed together like chickens in a coop. The police and secret agents often came to intimidate and demand money." Yang Lao San said, "The money I brought to Xuzhou was all extorted. I ended up as a beggar, sleeping in front of people's doors every night with my wife and children. The police cancelled the original refugee certificates and demanded another 2,000 yuan in fees to reissue them. I couldn't afford the refugee certificate and couldn't find a guarantor, so I was bullied everywhere. They wouldn't even let me sleep in front of the door. Now that I think about it, it was like entering hell."
Correction
In the Xinhua News Agency dispatch about the statement made by the spokesperson of the Liberated Area Relief Committee, published on page two of this newspaper on the 20th, the words "compiled by the Executive Headquarters" should be omitted after "according to the 'Schedule of Relief and Rehabilitation Areas and their Populations'." Also, the words "compiled by the Executive Headquarters" should be omitted after "according to the Seven Great Work Plans of 1943". Furthermore, "1943" was a mistake for "1946." We hereby make these corrections. Also, in the title "Zichang County Renamed Binghui County" on this page on the 4th of this month, "Zichang County" should read "Tianchang County."

　　“到了徐州如入地狱”
    鲁南逃亡地主悔悟归来
    【新华社滕县十八日电】鲁南滕县、临城等县，地主戚玉斑、张金乐等六十余人，前因误信国民党特务的造谣，被骗逃往徐州，最近已携眷重返解放区，对于受骗都表示痛恨。张金乐之子说：“国民党特务真该千刀万剜，害得我逃到徐州，受尽了活罪，在徐州租一间小房子，每月要用法币三万余元，没有钱的，只好搭草棚住，漏雨通风，全家挤在一起，活像鸡棚，警察和特务还常来威吓要钱”。杨老三说：“我在徐州带的钱被敲榨光了，流落为乞丐，每晚带着老婆孩子睡觉在人家门口，警察取消了原有的难民证，又得化二千元手续费重领，我领不起难民证，又找不到保人到处被人欺，连门口都不许睡，现在想起来真是如入地狱。”
　　更正
    本报二十日二版解放区救委会发言人谈话电讯中，根据“善后救济区域及其人口表”，根据下遗“行总编”三字。另根据一九四三年七大工作计划所载，根据下遗“行总编”三字。又四三年系四六年之误，特此更正。又本月四日本版标题“子长县易名炳辉县”，子长县应为天长县。
