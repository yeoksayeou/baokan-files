　　[Yangcheng Dispatch, 21st] Yan Xishan's army, actively colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek troops in southern Shanxi to attack Quwo and Xinjiang, has been repelled by the local Eighth Route Army in separate engagements. On the 17th, after parts of Yan's 39th and 66th Divisions occupied Quwo and Mengcheng, Yan's 72nd Division, which had moved north from Wenxi to Xinjiang on the 14th, simultaneously crossed the Fen River eastward to coordinate the attack on the Gaoxian Railway Station in Quwo, attempting to encircle our troops from the north and south. We resolutely counterattacked, and the occupied areas of eastern and western Fenyin, Beizhuang, Gaoyang, etc. (all belonging to Quwo County) were completely recovered. On the 19th, more than 900 Yan troops from Quwo City continued to attack Nanshangguan Village and other places northwest of the city. The local Eighth Route Army completely annihilated them, killing and capturing more than 400 Yan troops. On the morning of the 20th, more than 600 Yan troops from the 72nd Division again invaded the Lixi Village area of Xinjiang, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with our troops.
　　[Yangcheng Dispatch, 21st] Coordinating with the Chiang Kai-shek troops in southern Shanxi, the 219th Regiment of Yan Xishan's 73rd Division (reorganized from the puppet Wang Wanshun), the 1st Regiment of the 44th Division, and the "Love the Homeland Corps," totaling more than 2,000 men, who invaded Jingsheng Town in Lingshi on the 13th, continued to attack eastward on the 14th and 15th, capturing Jingjie, Guangji, Changshou, and other places within Lingshi, and once occupied Mahe. The local Eighth Route Army resolutely fought back, killing and wounding more than 100 Yan puppet troops, capturing 49 alive, and seizing 59 rifles and a quantity of ammunition. Six villages and towns, including Jingsheng, Huanjun, Shijia Mountain, Jinduan Yan, Shuyan, and Majia Mountain, were immediately recovered by us.
