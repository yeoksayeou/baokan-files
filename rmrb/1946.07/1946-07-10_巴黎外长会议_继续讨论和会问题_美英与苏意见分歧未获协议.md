Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 7th: Paris - The Four Foreign Ministers Conference continued its discussion on the issue of the 21-nation peace conference this afternoon, but no agreement was reached. At the beginning of the discussion, Bidault suggested that France should immediately issue invitations and agreed that France should mention in the invitations that her actions were based on the decision of the Four Powers Conference, but he opposed attaching the rules of procedure of the peace conference to the invitations. Bidault also stated that his agreement not to include China in the invited countries was conditional on the immediate issuance of invitations. Molotov emphasized that a decision on the organization and procedure of the peace conference was needed immediately in order to fully stipulate the powers of the peace conference. Molotov also criticized the French draft on the procedure of the peace conference that had been submitted to the meeting. Bidault and Bevin still insisted that the procedure of the peace conference should be decided by the peace conference. After a long period of argument, Bidault intervened, believing that France should now immediately issue invitations, and agreed to some extent with the opinions of the British and American representatives, but also believed that the Four Powers could raise objections to the issue of the order of the peace conference for the 21-nation peace conference to revise or discuss. Bidault then presented the French draft. Molotov then spoke, stating that he was prepared to examine the French plan and amendments. The Soviet plan on the procedure of the peace conference was not discussed at the afternoon meeting. The next meeting is scheduled for 10:00 AM on Monday.

    【新华社延安七日电】巴黎讯：四外长会议于今日下午继续讨论有关二十一国和会问题，尚未获得协议。讨论开始时，贝纳斯建议法国应立即发出请柬，并同意法国应于请柬中提及她的行动是根据四强会议的决定，但他反对请柬中附以和会的会议规则。贝纳斯并声明他之同意中国不列入邀请国，是以请柬立即发出为条件。莫洛托夫着重提议对和会组织与程序问题，需要立即作出决定，以便使和会的权力获得完整的规定。莫洛托夫并对已提交会议的法国关于和会程序的草案，提出批评。贝纳斯与贝文仍坚持和会程序应由和会决定，经长时间争执后，比道尔插入发言，认为现在应由法国立即发出请柬，并在某种程度上同意英美代表的意见，但还认为四强可以对和会秩序问题提出异议，供二十一国和会修正或商决之。比道尔继乃提出法国之草案。莫洛托夫随后发言，表示准备审查法方计划及修正案。下午会议中，未讨论苏方关于和会程序的计划。下次会议定星期一上午十时召开。
