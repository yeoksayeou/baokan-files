Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 14th. Soldiers of the Fifth Platoon of a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Forces bravely broke through the encirclement of Chiang's troops in Jilin and gloriously returned to the ranks. When the Fifth Platoon was surrounded by the enemy in Jilin on the 28th of last month, they lost contact with the main force. Besieged on all sides and unclear of the situation due to the darkness, platoon leader Lei Jinqi and veteran soldier Wang Naiyu decided to risk a breakout. However, they were surrounded as soon as they reached the streets of Jilin. The electric light was bright, and they had been discovered. The enemy barked, "Surrender your guns, take them alive! If you don't surrender, we'll shoot you dead!" They bravely charged back and forth towards the guard post with their comrades several times. The comrades said in unison, "We would rather die together than be disarmed by the enemy!" They charged to the street corner, drove back the sentries, and successfully escaped the tiger's mouth. Squad Deputy Xue Shiting and soldiers Liu Jinsheng, Zhang Zhizhou, Dou Huayi, and others also lost contact with the main force northwest of Jilin on May 28th. The next day, they spent the whole day crawling along the banks of the Songhua River, without being discovered by the KMT troops. On the third day, they arrived at Xinyang Railway Station. While they were buying food in the village, enemies again demanded that they surrender their weapons. They raised their guns and shouted loudly, "Whoever dares to come forward, I am a Communist Party member and have never known what it means to surrender! Whoever dares to move, I will kill him!" The enemies were frightened and ran away. On the fourth day, they walked 180 li and finally gloriously returned to their own ranks on the eighth day. Their firm, calm and courageous actions greatly moved all their comrades.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th. Kuomintang troops continued to attack the Democratic Allied Forces in the Eastern Manchuria area. In the Meihekou area, two battalions of Chiang's troops attacked the liberated areas south of Meihekou on the 13th. The Democratic Allied Forces rose up to defend themselves and repelled them, inflicting more than 30 casualties on the invading troops. In the Jiaohe area, more than 1,000 Chiang's troops arrived at Liushu River on the 13th. Furthermore, more than 200 bandits armed by the Kuomintang troops occupied our Baiqi (north of Yongji). The Democratic Allied Forces launched an attack on the 13th, killing and wounding more than 20 bandits and seizing one American-style light machine gun and more than 30 rifles.

    【新华社哈尔滨十四日电】民主联军某部第五班战士，在吉林英勇突破蒋军重围，光荣归队。当第五班于上月二十八日在吉林被敌包围时，与主力失却联系，四面受敌，又因天黑不明情况，而班长雷金崎与老战士王乃玉，决定冒险突围，但刚到吉林街上，就被团团包围。当时电光很明，已被对方发现，对方狂吠“缴枪，拿活的，不缴枪，打死”，他们带着兄弟们英勇的向岗卡来回冲了好几次，兄弟们异口同声的说：“宁死在一块，绝不被敌缴械”。他们冲到街口，打退了哨兵，遂胜利脱出虎口。该队一排副薛士廷和战士刘金胜、张之舡、窦花义等，也于五月廿八日在吉林西北与主力失掉联络，次日在松花江畔爬了一天，顽军俱未发现。第三天他们赶到新阳车站，正在村上买饭吃时，又有敌人要他们缴械投降，他们端起枪，大声喊道：“那个敢上来，老子是共产党员，从来不知缴枪是什么！谁敢动，就打死谁”！敌人吓的跑了。第四天他们走了一百八十里，直到第八天才荣归自己的队伍。他们坚定沉着的英勇行动，大大感动了所有的同志。
