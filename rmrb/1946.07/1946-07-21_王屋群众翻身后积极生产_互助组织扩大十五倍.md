　　Wangwu Masses Vigorously Engage in Production After Emancipation
    Mutual Aid Organizations Expand Fifteenfold
    [Our newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch] After the emancipation movement, the masses in Wangwu County have universally experienced high production enthusiasm, and mutual aid organizations have greatly developed. Currently, there are a total of 1,100 mutual aid groups in the county, fifteen times the number of last year, with 60% of farming households organized into collective production. Before the start of spring plowing, the government issued loans of 2.5 million yuan. Farmers used the loans to purchase 300 head of draft cattle and 666 pieces of agricultural equipment. The county has reclaimed 4,700 mu of wasteland and eliminated 1,677 mu. In terms of intensive farming, each mu of autumn land was fertilized with 80 loads of manure, and each mu of cotton field was fertilized with 90 loads of manure. Wheat in the entire county was hoed once (which was never done in the past), and cotton has been hoed twice. In addition, during the agricultural slack season, 18 li of the Ji (Yuan) to Yuan (Qu) highway were repaired, enabling 700 farm households to transport manure by cart, saving 10,000 workdays annually, which can be used for intensive farming. The original plan was to plant 15,000 mu of cotton throughout the county, but now every household in the county is planting cotton. In Beiyang alone, 385 mu of cotton have been planted. Tree planting, based on statistics from three villages, has reached 14,650 trees, an average of nine trees per person. In eliminating wolf infestation, it has become a widespread movement. According to statistics, a total of 31 wolves and 20,000 rats have been killed. The best mutual aid group in the county is the Li Shisheng mutual aid group in Liugou. Out of 274 households in the village, 204 households are organized, accounting for 80.6% of the village. The characteristics of this mutual aid group are: (1) starting small and expanding throughout the village, (2) voluntary participation and free withdrawal, and (3) sound systems.
