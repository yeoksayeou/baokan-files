The Attacker's Miserable Defeat
A Record of the Self-Defense Battle of Twelve Warriors in Mafang, Fourth Sub-district of Taihang
Yan Xin

　　Since Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi conducted their civil war mobilization in Xinxiang, the situation in northern Henan has become increasingly tense. The reactionary armed forces frequently harassed the liberated areas, and consequently, they often received the punishment they deserved. The following record is merely one example out of thousands.

　　　　　　1. The Enemy Always Fantasizes About Swallowing Us in One Bite

　　At dawn on May 22nd, the 3rd Battalion of the 415th Regiment of the 139th Division of the stubborn 32nd Army, which had invaded Wuliyuan in Xiuwu - this unit of Kuomintang troops, known for looting the people and being keen on civil war, heard that our Mafang garrison troops were not numerous. With overwhelming superiority, they attempted to eliminate our small force in one fell swoop, hoping to gain a "bragging" achievement.

　　Our Mafang garrison consisted of fifteen people in total, including a platoon leader. At night, there were three mobile sentries. After discovering a large number of enemies, they first moved to the outer perimeter and fired at the enemy. The enemy rushed straight at the village where we were stationed; the troops inside the village, upon hearing the alarm, were about to rush out, but the enemy had already surrounded them from all directions. Platoon Leader Qin Shaoxi quickly mobilized and commanded everyone to occupy the flat rooftops to resist. The three comrades on the outer perimeter immediately reported to the rear troops for assistance.

　　The enemy surged in with over two hundred men, carrying American machine guns and cannons, with a fierce momentum. First, they stepped on a landmine in the southeast of the village. With a loud bang, the enemy on the west side thought it was cannon fire and immediately machine-gunned like a storm. Then, the enemy occupied all the surrounding rooftops. But the soldiers were not afraid at all under the call of Platoon Leader Qin. The enemy shouted: "Today you are surrounded by us, hand over your guns!" The response was loud gunfire. The shouter retreated and shouted wildly: "Chinese don't fight Chinese, surrender and we will treat you well!" Squad Leader Yang Laibao retorted: "If Chinese don't fight Chinese, why are you here to fight us? Aren't you Chinese?" The enemy was speechless and threatened: "If you don't surrender, we will burn you to death with incendiary bombs!" Our soldiers answered in unison: "We are not afraid of you! We are glorious to die for the people, what are you?"

　　　　　　2. Developing Our Firepower to Subdue the Enemy's Firepower

　　The enemy was filled with shame and anger, and shouted loudly: "Charge! Charge!" Immediately, several routes charged up, but all fell under our calm and accurate shooting. Platoon Leader Qin Shaoxi personally controlled the machine gun, knocking down seven or eight with one burst. The enemy dared not charge again after shouting. Du Wencheng used a rifle to block the east entrance of the street, knocking down two in a row. The enemy only shouted and dared not charge again.

　　At this time, machine guns were sweeping like hail. The soldiers understood that only by developing their own firepower could they subdue the enemy's firepower. Therefore, several people concentrated their fire on the machine gun in the graveyard in the northwest corner, which posed the greatest threat. Immediately, the machine gun went silent.

　　The enemy set up a cannon in the southwest. Obviously, if the cannon was set up properly, the flat roof would not withstand a few shells; but the soldiers were not panicked at all. First, they aimed and shot down a gunner, and the others panicked and could not find a suitable place to set up the cannon.

　　In this way, our firepower was fully developed, making the enemy unable to lift their heads. In an instant, they suddenly saw the enemy grabbing villagers from the village to send their wounded soldiers.

　　However, the ammunition was gradually running out. Yang Laibao said: "It doesn't matter, keep holding on, our reinforcements are coming soon."

　　　　　　3. Losing Thirty-Three Soldiers, They Only Blame Themselves for Attacking

　　Sure enough, reinforcements arrived. The enemy was already demoralized. Seeing the reinforcements from afar, they were ready to retreat. Our reinforcements had already rushed over, everyone braving the anger. As soon as they saw the enemy, they launched a charge. The enemy panicked, abandoned four wounded, and fled for their lives in all directions, regardless of mud or water. The twelve warriors on our roof also rushed down with bayonets.

　　The enemy ran really hard, running back to Wuliyuan in one breath, many turned into drowned rats, and some even dropped their weapons.

　　After going to count the casualties, excluding the four lost by Mafang (including one platoon leader and one deputy platoon leader), twenty-nine lay dead on the streets of Wuliyuan. Officers were dejected, soldiers cried bitterly, and once again blamed their superiors for not attacking in the first place, why bother with this move.

　　An officer who did not participate in the battle asked a person from Mafang with uncertain suspicion:

　　"How many Eighth Route Army soldiers are there in Mafang after all?"

　　"Ten or twenty."

　　"Do they have cannons?"

　　"I don't know."

　　Immediately someone said: "They have destroyed our blockhouse, how could they not have cannons?"

　　In fact, not only cannons, but also something more powerful than atomic bombs, that is, our infinite mass strength and the resolute and unified will to oppose civil war and oppose fascism.

　　Finally, it should be stated that the twelve warriors of Mafang are all comrades from the new recruits company of the division's ×× regiment! However, since the rectification, their shooting skills have greatly improved.

　　进攻者的惨败
　　记太行四分区马坊十二位勇士的自卫战斗
　　雁心
    自从蒋介石、白崇禧在新乡进行内战动员后，豫北形势更一天紧张一天。反动派武装经常袭扰解放区，因此也就经常受到它应得的惩罚。以下的记载不过是千万回中的一个例证罢了。
            一、敌人总妄想一口吞掉我们
    五月二十二日拂晓，侵占我修武五里源的顽三十二军一三九师四一五团三营——这部分素以劫掠人民和勇于内战著名的国民党军，打听着我们马坊守卫部队并不多，便以压倒的优势，企图一举消灭我小部队，好博得一次“大可炫耀”的功绩。
    我守卫马坊部队一共十五个人，内有一排副同在。夜里有三个游动哨，发现大批敌人后，他们先转入外圈，向敌射击，敌人却直扑向我所住材落；村内部队闻惊正欲往外冲出，敌人已四面八方团围来，排副秦绍喜临时机动一下，指挥大家占领平房顶，进行抵抗。在外圈的三位同志，即刻向后方部队告援。
    敌人涌来有二百多，带有美国机枪和炮，气势汹汹，首先踏响村东南的地雷，轰的一声，西面敌人以为是炮响，立刻机枪像刮风一样打过来。接着，敌人把周围的房顶都占据了。但战士们在秦排副的号召下一点也不胆怯。敌人大喊道：“今天你们可被我们包围了，缴枪吧！”回答的是响亮的枪声。喊话的缩回头去又狂叫：“中国人不打中国人，缴枪优待你们！”班长杨来保反问道：“中国人不打中国人你们来打我们干啥？难道你们不是中国人？”敌人无话可说了，威胁道：“不投降，拿燃烧弹烧死你们！”我们的战士齐声回答道：“不怕你们！我们为了老百姓死也光荣，你们算啥？”
            二、发扬我们火力，制服敌人火力
    敌人羞怒交集了，大声喊：“冲！冲！”立刻几路冲上来，可是都在我们沉着而准确的射击下倒下去，排副秦绍喜亲自掌握机枪，一梭子打倒七八个，敌人连冲六次，都被打回去。杜文成一枝步枪封锁住街东口，连打倒两个，敌人光喊不敢冲再上来。
    这时机枪却像雹雨一般扫射着。战士们懂得只有发扬自己的火力，才能制服敌人火力，于是几个人集中射击西北角坟地里威胁最大的一挺机枪，立刻机枪哑了。
    西南地敌人架起炮来，显然炮若架好，平房是不够几轰的；但战士们一点也不慌，首先瞄准打倒一个炮兵，其余的便慌了手足，再找不到适当的架炮地方。
    这样一来，我们的火力完全发扬了，打的敌人抬不起头来，刹那间，忽然看见敌人从村子里抓老乡来替他们送伤兵。
    可是，弹药逐渐打完了。杨来保说：“不要紧，继续坚持下去，我们的援军快到了。”
            三、损兵折将三十三名，只怨不该来进攻
    果然援兵到了。敌人本来就已泄了气，老远看着援兵就待退却，我们的援兵已飞奔而至，大家都冒着怒火，一看见敌人就展开冲锋。敌人慌乱了，撇下四个负伤的，不管泥里水里四散逃命。我们房上的十二位勇士也挺着刺刀冲下来。
    敌人跑步可真上劲，一口气跑回五里源，好多变成落汤鸡，有的连武器也掉了。
    四去统计伤亡，除马坊丢的四个外（内有一个排长，一个排副），五里源街上横三顺四躺下二十九个。军官垂头丧气，士兵痛哭流涕，再一次的埋怨上级本来就不该去打，何苦来这一着。
    一位没有参加战斗的军官怀疑不定的问一位马坊来的人说：
    “马坊到底有多少八路军？”
    “一二十个。”
    “有炮吗？”
    “不知道。”
    立刻有人说道：“他们把我们炮楼都打垮过，怎会没有炮？”
    其实，何只炮，比原子炸弹更厉害的也有，那就是我们无穷尽的群众力量和坚决一致反内战反法西斯的意志。
    最后应该说明一句：马坊十二位勇士还都是分区××团新兵连的同志呢！不过，整训以来，他们的射击技术都大有进步就是了。
