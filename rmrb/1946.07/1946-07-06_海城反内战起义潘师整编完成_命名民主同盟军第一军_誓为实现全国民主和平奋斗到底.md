Xinhua News Agency, Andong, June 23rd: (Delayed) The entire officers and soldiers of the Yunnan Army's 184th Division, who staged the Haicheng anti-civil war uprising, and the anti-civil war officers and soldiers who have recently come over with their weapons from the Northeast Kuomintang civil war front lines, were reorganized on the 18th of this month into the Democratic Allied Army's First Army, under which are the New First Division and the 184th Division. All the officers and soldiers publicly elected General Pan Shuoduan as the army commander, General Zheng Zuzhi as the deputy army commander and concurrently commander of the New First Division, General Ma Yifei, the former chief of staff of the 184th Division, as the army chief of staff, and Wei Ying, the former commander of the 552nd Regiment, was promoted to commander of the 184th Division. After the reorganization was completed, the army sent a telegram to the China Democratic League and all sectors of society across the country, firmly expressing its determination to fight to the end for peace and democracy. It also replied to telegrams of gratitude to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Commander Lin, General Gao Shuxun, and other representatives of the liberated areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: General Ma Yifei, Chief of Staff of the Democratic Allied Army, recently made a statement to reporters regarding the establishment of the army, saying, "Our army is organized on the basis of the original 184th Division and other Yunnan army soldiers who are unwilling to engage in civil war and have come over successively." He said, "All our commanders and fighters are unwilling to kill each other and be used as cannon fodder in the civil war, so we launched the Haicheng Uprising, intending to use practical actions to admonish Chiang Kai-shek, who came to Shenyang to arrange the civil war. Later, upon hearing of the half-month ceasefire in the Northeast, all officers and soldiers of the army had infinite hope for peace, but until June 21st, all words and deeds disappointed us. The Kuomintang government, on the one hand, pretended to cease fire, and on the other hand, tried its best to destroy the democratic cultural cause, and made the special agent rule, which is absolutely opposed to democratic politics, more open and legalized, such as the implementation of the "police-controlled district system," which proves that the Kuomintang authorities have absolutely no sincerity in implementing democracy. It is heard that in the negotiations, the Kuomintang government insisted that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army must give up large cities and transportation hubs. If the rumors are true, it will further expose the Kuomintang's ambition to insist on expanding the civil war. All the large cities and transportation hubs in China belong to the Chinese people. If the peace negotiations are successful and the coalition government is realized, there is no need to argue at all." Finally, he said, "According to reliable information, the Kuomintang army in the southwest has been continuously transporting troops to central China, deploying troops and generals, and the scope of the civil war is expanding nationwide. The fate of the country is critical. Our army is still undergoing reorganization, using the Democratic Allied Army as the naming of our army, vowing to fight to the end for the complete realization of national peace and democracy!"

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: According to the Kunming Student Daily and the Shanghai Shen Bao, the only Yunnan Army Provisional 19th Division in Yunnan, led by Long Yun's second son, Long Chunwu, requested the Yunnan Garrison Headquarters to revoke the division's designation, allow all soldiers to retire, and issue retirement certificates. However, the Kuomintang government took encirclement deployments against the division's garrisons in Kunming, Yanglin, and Qujing, building fortifications, and at night, when the division conducted exercises, the Kuomintang troops released alerts as if facing a formidable enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Shanghai News: Three hundred and twenty Northeastern refugees who formerly fled to Kunming, Guiyang, Chongqing, and Xi'an are now residing in Shanghai, waiting for ships to return home, but because ships are busy with military transportation, many have become peddlers and coolies. Among the refugees is Zhang Xueliang's grandmother, Mrs. Lu (now eighty-two years old), and her three granddaughters. They are in dire straits because Mrs. Lu's children, grandchildren, and granddaughters-in-law were arrested (on suspicion of privately storing military supplies). They are now waiting for their children and grandchildren to be released before deciding what to do.

　　海城反内战起义潘师整编完成
    命名民主同盟军第一军
    誓为实现全国民主和平奋斗到底
    【新华社安东六月二十三日电】（迟到）海城反内战起义之滇军一八四师全体官兵，及最近从东北国民党各内战前线相率携械来归之反内战官兵，于本月十八日整编为民主同盟军第一军，下属新一师及一八四师两个师。全体官兵公推潘朔端将军为军长，郑祖志将军为副军长兼新一师师长，原一八四师参谋长马逸飞将军为军参谋长，原五五二团魏瑛团长，晋级为一八四师师长。该军在整编就绪后，致电中国民主同盟及全国各界，坚决表示为和平民主而奋斗到底。并复电答谢朱总司令，林总司令，高树勋将军等之慰问及解放区各界贺电。
    【新华社延安二日电】民主同盟军参谋长马逸飞将军，顷就该军成立事，对记者发表谈话称：“本军以原一八四师为基础，及其他不愿内战陆续来归之滇军军人组织而成。”他说：“我全体指战员，不愿自相残杀，充作内战炮灰，乃于海城起义，拟以实际行动，谏静亲来沈阳布置内战之蒋介石。其后闻东北有停战半月之说，全军官兵均以和平有望，曾寄予无限希望，但直至六月二十一日，一切言行均使吾人失望。国民党政府一面佯言停战，一面又极力摧残民主文化事业，并将与民主政治绝对对立之特务统治更加公开合法化，如“警管区制”之实施，证明国民党当局完全没有实行民主的诚意。据闻在谈判中，国民党政府坚持八路军、新四军必须让出大城市及交通要道，如传闻无讹，则更加暴露国民党坚持扩大内战的野心。尽中国之大城市及交通要道，均属于中国人民，如和平谈判成功，联合政府实现，则根本无须争执。”最后他说：“据确悉，连日来西南国民党军队又不断向华中输送，调兵遣将，内战范围有扩大全国之势，国运危急，本军仍进行整编，以民主同盟军为本军之命名，誓为全国和平民主之彻底实现而奋斗到底！”
    【新华社延安三日电】据昆明学生报及沪申报载：龙云次公子龙纯武统率之唯一留滇滇军暂编第十九师，向滇警备总部请求撤销该师番号，全部士兵准予退役，并发给退役证明书后，国民党政府竟对该师昆明、杨林、曲靖各驻地采取包围部署，构筑工事，夜间如遇该师出操时，国民党部队即放出警戒，如临大敌。
    【新华社延安一日电】沪讯：前流亡昆明、贵阳、重庆、西安之东北难民三百二十人，现寓居沪上，候轮返乡，然以船只忙于军运未果，多流为小贩苦力，难民中并有张学良将军外祖母卢老太太（现年八十二岁）及其孙女三人，伊等系因卢老太太之儿孙及孙媳（私藏军火嫌疑）被捕，致生活无着，现正候其儿孙释放后再定行止。
