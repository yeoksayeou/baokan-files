　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th: Shanghai News: The "Sino-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" was formally established in late June. The Chinese and American sides each have eleven members. The American leader, Hertsog, stated: The main purpose of the group is to assist the Chinese government in formulating agricultural improvement plans, promote Sino-US technical cooperation, and determine urgent measures for Chinese agriculture. He also said, "Special attention will be paid to studying methods of improving and increasing production of China's four agricultural products: silk, tea, wool, and tung oil." The American members of the group all arrived in Shanghai on the 24th of last month and have been actively consulting with relevant parties of the Kuomintang government in recent days, and will travel to various parts of China for inspection. Their wool weaving expert, along with Xu Zukang, director of the Kuomintang Northwest Wool Management Office, went to the Northwest on the 10th to investigate and study China's wool weaving industry. Democratic figures and national industrialists in Beijing and Shanghai are extremely worried about this, and believe that this is an important step in the "industrial America, agricultural China" plot of American imperialist elements, and one of the main links in the colonization of China.
