　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Hubei, 24th: The Central Plains Communist troops, surrounded by Chiang's army south of Jingziguan, have been engaged in fierce battles with Chiang's Hu Zongnan's troops, the 41st Army, and the 10th Army in the area south of Jingziguan, Baoyuling, Nanhua Tang, and west of Zhao Jia Chuan. They have now broken through the largest encirclement and are transferring in separate routes. Chiang's army is now redeploying its forces to arrange another encirclement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: Military News: A portion of our Central Plains troops that broke through to the west of the Han River has been engaged in fierce battles with Chiang's army in the Baokang and Fangxian areas west of Xiangyang for several days. On the morning of the 21st, Chiang's army again launched a fierce attack on our army from Shihua Street, north of Baokang. Our commanders and fighters, angered by the repeated pursuit of Chiang's army after the breakthrough, determined to put us to death, resolutely defended themselves. After a fierce battle until dusk on the same day, near Cangyugou, more than ten miles west of Shihua Street, they defeated the attacking Chiang's army, capturing more than ten machine guns, five artillery pieces, more than one hundred rifles, two radio stations, and other military supplies. Chiang's army suffered more than 400 casualties. Currently, in addition to the original pursuing troops of the 75th Army's 16th Division and the 66th Army's 185th Division continuing to attack our army between Baokang and Fangxian, Chiang's army has also transferred a division under the command of the Chongqing Headquarters from Wushan, Sichuan, rapidly towards Fangxian and its western Zhushan area, to block our advance.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 23rd: The northern line of Chiang Kai-shek's army, attacking the Suwan Liberated Area, has launched a fierce offensive similar to the southern line. Both the north and south lines are currently engaged in intense fighting. On the northern line, the 11th Division of the 58th Army of Chiang's army, advancing west from Xuzhou and Jiagou towards the liberated areas north of the Huai River and west of the Jinpu Railway, after invading the liberated area of Tongshan County, including Jianggou, Bailizhai, Sunshan, and Yonghe (all northwest of Jiagou) on the 17th, captured the strategically important Xiaoxian city in the triangular area south of the Longhai Railway and west of the Jinpu Railway on the 18th. Xiaoxian was liberated from the Japanese invaders by the New Fourth Army last year and had been invaded and occupied by the Kuomintang army twice this year, in January and April. This is the third time it has been invaded and occupied. The 60th Division of the 99th Army of Chiang's army (transferred from Zhenjiang to the Xuzhou-Suxian line on the 10th of this month), cooperating with the westward advance from north of Suxian, occupied the important town of Suixi Kou southwest of Xiaoxian on the morning of the 19th with a regiment of American aircraft. These two routes of Chiang's army continue to advance westward, attempting to invade Yongcheng in eastern Henan. The New Fourth Army is resisting. On the southern line, four battalions of a portion of the 65th Army of Chiang's army, and two regiments of the 99th Division of the 99th Army, advancing from Jingjiang, Subei, continue to advance north. On the 18th, a battalion of the 99th Division was annihilated by the New Fourth Army while attacking Chenqiao southwest of Huangqiao. Their subsequent reinforcements confronted the New Fourth Army on the Fenjiedi line, 20 li northeast of Huangqiao. The 40th Division and the 148th Division of the 25th Army of Chiang's army, advancing eastward from Taizhou, Shentong, and other places, occupied Jiangyan on the 19th and are now engaged in fierce fighting with the New Fourth Army near Magou, ten li east of Jiangyan. At 6:00 AM on the 26th, two Chiang aircraft intruded into the airspace over Wuhe County, a liberated area east of the Jinpu Railway in northern Anhui, and strafed back and forth for an hour, wounding a child. The aircraft also dropped several bombs into the Huai River, sinking four sailing boats. At 9:00 AM on the same morning, another Chiang aircraft flew over the area and strafed. The New Fourth Army defended Rugao and launched a counterattack against the 49th Army of Chiang's army. After five days of fierce fighting, from the 17th to the 21st, the three divisions of the army, including the 26th Division, the 79th Division, and the 105th Division, were wiped out. The army commander, Wang Tiehan, the deputy army commander, Wang Kejun, and more than 10,000 others all laid down their weapons. The results of the battle are still being tallied.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Rugao, 23rd: Just as Chiang's army is launching a large-scale offensive against the Suwan Liberated Area, 46 Chiang's army officers who laid down their weapons in the battle to attack the Nantong and Haimen Liberated Areas two months ago were sent back to their units by the First Military Sub-district Command of Central China. They were given more than 3 million yuan in legal tender for travel expenses. A farewell meeting was held, and more than a thousand people went to see them off, hoping that they would not fight a civil war again after returning.
