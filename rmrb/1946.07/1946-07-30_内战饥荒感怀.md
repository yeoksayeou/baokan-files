Lament on Famine During the Civil War
    He Xiangning

    After eight years of exile, I return in victory,
    Rumors of civil war intensify my indignation.
    I cannot bear to recall those thirteen years,
    Spirits beneath the earth must sigh with sorrow.
    Starving corpses litter the victorious streets,
    The Three Principles of the People are not what they once were.
    The sound of hunger echoes across China,
    Corrupt officials and greedy mandarins incite extreme public resentment.
    How can economic aggression be dispelled?
    Years of borrowing debts pile up like mountains.
    Money is turned into the ashes of bullets,
    Everywhere fertile fields grow thorns.
    Alas, in ten households, nine are empty,
    The people are poor, wealth is exhausted, and hunger and cold press hard.
    With no way to make a living, they go to join the army,
    Willing to be servants for the commanders.
    A ruthless cannonball roars,
    Wiping out hundreds of millions of lives.
    Brothers fighting within the walls, what can be done?
    The blood of compatriots stains the land.
    I hear the young wife weeping in her chamber,
    Longing for her son and missing her husband, she sighs deeply.
    Unaware that they are already on the execution ground,
    Their souls meet in dreams, each lamenting.
    A message to future generations of youth:
    Our ambitions must not fade.
    Heaven endows us with talent for a purpose,
    Today we die, tomorrow we are reborn.
    Those who came before sacrifice, those who follow continue,
    From now on, countless martyrs will come.
    Flowers bloom and fall year after year,
    How many times have yellow flowers bloomed on blood-soaked graves?

　　内战饥荒感怀
    何香凝
    八载逃亡胜利回
    内战传闻增愤激
    不堪回首十三年
    泉下有灵应叹息
    胜利街头饿殍尸
    三民主义今非昔
    中华遍地饥饿声
    污吏贪官民怨极
    经济侵凌祸怎销
    频年借债如山积
    金钱变作炮弹灰
    到处肥田生荆棘
    可怜十室九家空
    民贫财尽饥寒逼
    谋生无路去投军
    愿为司令当执役
    无情炮弹一声鸣
    丧尽生灵千万亿
    兄弟阅墙可奈何
    遍地同胞鲜血迹
    遥闻少妇泣闺中
    望子思夫长叹息
    不知已上断头台
    梦魂相会各音哀
    留言后辈青年者
    我等雄心且莫灰
    天生我材必有用
    今天死了再胚胎
    前者牺牲后者继
    此后无穷烈士来
    花开花落年年在
    血冢黄花几度开
