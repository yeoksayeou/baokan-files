　　A Record of Welcoming the Landing of the Dongjiang Column
    Kong Dongping
    The Dongjiang Column, which the ten million people of Jiaodong had been longing for day and night, arrived in Yantai on the 5th. The entire city of Yantai was swept into a wave of jubilation by this good news. Every company and shop hung flags and decorations, and the sound of gongs and drums shook the sky. Millions of soldiers and civilians, holding flags and wearing flowers, surged towards the welcoming line at the dock like a tide, crowding the streets, which stretched for several miles, until they were impenetrable. Shop assistants, workers, women, young students, and shop owners braved the July sun, waiting with anxious hearts to catch a glimpse of the heroes from the south.
    The ship docked. When Commander Zeng Sheng led 2,500 strong and brave Dongjiang Column brothers ashore, and met with Commander Wang Bin of the Jiaodong Military Region, Director Cao Manzhi of the Administrative Office, and representatives from all sectors of the Yantai Party, government, military, and civilians, they were moved by a great revolutionary friendship. Everyone shook hands tightly, with enthusiasm replacing words that were temporarily impossible to express due to the intricate mix of emotions. The soldiers were all full of energy and well-equipped. They spoke in the difficult-to-understand Cantonese language, enthusiastically waving to the welcoming crowd to express their thanks. Dockworkers excitedly unloaded ammunition and luggage, shouting "Welcome to the meritorious Dongjiang Column!" Many American sailors were moved by this great scene of friendship between the army and the people, giving a thumbs up and repeatedly praising. The heroic ranks passed through the welcoming crowds lining the streets. Young people crowded on the low walls immediately jumped down, rushed through the crowd to the front, and curiously watched the soldiers' rifles and British-style light and heavy machine guns. Female students and members of the Women's Rescue Association scrambled to give flowers and fruits to the soldiers. Patients, women, and children on large trucks all stood up and waved emotionally, thanking the enthusiasm of the people of Yantai. Their carriages were immediately filled with flowers, fruits, and other gifts of appreciation.
    When Commander Zeng, Commander Wang, and Director Cao appeared on the temporary podium, the sound of firecrackers, music, gongs and drums, and deafening cheers mixed together, forming a magnificent symphony. Reporters' cameras were busy capturing the moving scenes one by one. The speakers' appeals and the responses of millions of people merged into waves of roaring waves rising and falling, "Welcome the Dongjiang Column!" "Resolutely defend peace!" "Swear to defend Yantai! Defend the liberated areas!" "Oppose the fascist elements' civil war dictatorship! Oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' betrayal of the country and seeking glory!"
    Commander Zeng took the stage. This anti-Japanese hero, loved by the people, was immediately surrounded by students, women, workers, and shop assistants, clusters of bright and dazzling flowers, adorned his body, inserted into his hat, and worn on his chest. He began to speak in a loud voice: "In order to implement the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's policy of peace, the Dongjiang Column reluctantly bid farewell, with tears in our eyes, to the Dongjiang liberated area and our hometown's elders, brothers and sisters, where we fought bitterly for eight years, and came to the distant north. This is entirely for the sake of achieving national peace. We must continue to implement the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's policy of peace and strive to build an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China!" Millions of people supported his firm and powerful appeal with excited cheers. After the meeting, a continuous stream of people, accompanied by thunderous cheers, escorted the Dongjiang Column comrades to their camps for rest.

　　欢迎东江纵队登陆记
    孔东平
    胶东一千万人民日夜渴望着的东江纵队，五日抵达烟台了。整个烟台市被这喜讯卷入狂欢的浪潮中，每家公司商店悬旗结彩，锣鼓喧天，千万军民执旗挂花，潮水一般涌向码头欢迎的行列，沿着长达数里的街道拥得水泄不通。店员、工人、妇女、青年学生、商店老板冒着七月的烈日抱着焦急的心情等待着瞻仰南方的英雄。
    船靠岸了。当曾生司令率领二千五百名东纵健俊兄弟荷枪登陆，和胶东军区王彬司令，行署曹漫之主任及烟台党政军民各界代表会见时，被一种伟大的革命友爱所激动，大家紧紧地握着手，热烈代替了因感情的错踪交织而一时无法表达的话语，战士们个个精神饱满，装备整齐，他们操着难懂的广东话，热情的向欢迎的人群挥手致谢。码头工人兴奋地卸下弹药和行李并高呼“欢迎劳苦功高的东江纵队”，许多美国水兵为这军民友爱的伟大场面所感动，翘起大姆指连声赞叹。雄纠纠的行列从欢迎的人群夹道中通过，挤在短墙上的青年人立即跳下来，冲过人群到前面新奇的观看战士们的来福枪和英国式轻重机枪。女学生和妇救会会员们，争先向战士们手里送鲜花和水果，乘着大卡车的病号和妇女儿童都站起来感动的挥手高呼，答谢烟台人民的热情，他们的车厢立刻被鲜花水果等慰劳的礼物塞满了。
    当曾司令、王司令、曹主任出现在临时讲台时，鞭炮声、作乐声、锣鼓声和震耳的欢呼混成一片，形成一支雄壮的交响曲，记者们的开麦拉忙着将动人的场面一个个摄入镜头，讲演者的号召和千万人的响应，融成一阵阵此起彼落的怒吼的波涛，“欢迎东江纵队！”“坚决保卫和平！”“誓死保卫烟台！保卫解放区！”“反对法西斯分子的内战独裁！反对国民党反动派的卖国求荣！”
    曾司令登台了。这位人民热爱的抗日英雄，立即被学生、妇女、工人、店员紧紧的环抱起来，一簇簇鲜艳夺目的花朵，向他身上缀饰，帽上穿插、襟上胸前佩带，他以宏亮的声音开始讲话：“东江纵队为了执行中国共产党中央的和平方针，忍痛挥泪告别了苦斗八年的东江解放区和故乡的父老姐妹，到辽远的北方，这完全是为了争取全国和平的实现。我们要继续贯彻中共中央的和平方针，为建设独立和平民主的新中国而奋斗！”千万的人民以激动的欢呼拥护他那坚决有力的号召。会后川流的人群以雷动的欢呼，伴送东江纵队同志至宿营地休息。
