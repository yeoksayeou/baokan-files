　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th. Following the announcement of the extension of the Northeast ceasefire order, He Yingqin flew from Nanjing to Xi'an on the 13th, from Xi'an to Beiping on the 25th, and yesterday flew from Beiping to Shenyang, and is about to go to Changchun. He Yingqin's trip is purely to take advantage of the ceasefire agreement to actively launch a full-scale civil war.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the United Press on the 29th: Rendel reports: Wenhui Bao published unconfirmed news saying that He Yingqin will be appointed Director of the Kuomintang Northeast Headquarters in Manchuria. If the rumors are true, this is an important sign that the Kuomintang reactionaries' plot to annihilate the Communist Party has succeeded. Since resigning from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, He Yingqin has been inspecting troops in various places, and it is reported that he is encouraging troops in various places to continue the anti-communist civil war.

　　利用停战间隙布置全面内战
    何应钦经西安北平飞长春
    传何将任国民党东北行营主任
    【新华社延安二十七日电】延长东北停战令发布后，何应钦即于十三日由南京飞抵西安，二十五日由西安飞抵北平，昨日又由平飞往沈阳，并即将赴长春。何应钦此行，纯为利用停战协定之间隙，积极发动全面内战。
    【新华社延安三十日电】据合众社上海二十九日电：伦德尔报导：文汇报发表未经证实消息谓，何应钦将就任满洲国民党东北行营主任，如众所传属实，这就是一个重要的征候，表示国民党反动派企图对共产党歼灭战的姣计业已得售。何应钦自放弃中国陆军总司令一职以来，即巡视各地驻军，据悉他在鼓励各地军队继续反共内战。
