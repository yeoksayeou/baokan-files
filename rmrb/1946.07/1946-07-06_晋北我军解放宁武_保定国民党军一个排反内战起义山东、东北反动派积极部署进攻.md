Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 3rd: The city of Ningwu on the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has been completely liberated by the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army on the 1st. This is the third county town liberated by the Eighth Route Army in response to the urgent requests and self-defense actions of millions of people in the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, following the recovery of Shuoxian and Shanyin. Since then, the 240-mile railway line from XuanGang town in the south to Daiyue town in the north of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has been effectively managed by the people's armed forces. When our army entered Ningwu city at 7:30 a.m. on the 1st, it was warmly welcomed by the local people, and the order of the whole city is rapidly recovering.

Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 1st: The 3rd Platoon of the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, 201st Regiment of the Kuomintang Army stationed in Baoding, refused the order for civil war and staged an uprising on the morning of the 20th of last month, carrying three light machine guns, one grenade launcher, and thirteen rifles. They have now arrived in the local Eighth Route Army defense area and have been warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians.

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 3rd: Between Xuzhou and Jinan, Kuomintang troops are being airlifted frequently. Since the 18th of last month, more than 50 Kuomintang military aircraft stationed in Xuzhou have been transporting troops and weapons northward three times a day. The traffic was very busy at the end of June, with no less than 100 aircraft flying over Yizhi county on the 27th and 28th alone. Currently, the Kuomintang army is attacking the central Shandong liberated area from the east and west. They have successively occupied county towns such as Yidu and Zhangqiu. This kind of troop transportation by the Kuomintang authorities in violation of the agreement is obviously intended to expand the civil war in Shandong. The Kuomintang's 54th Army, fully equipped with American weapons, was transported by American warships to Qingdao. Its 198th Division, combined with the puppet army of Zhang Qilu, attacked Jimo city. Our Jiaodong Eighth Route Army was forced to defend itself, and successively annihilated three battalions and one heavy machine gun platoon. After suffering this powerful blow, the vanguard retreated across the board on the 29th. It is now undergoing reorganization and appears ready to attack again.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 1st: Recently, the Kuomintang army in various parts of the Northeast has been actively carrying out military deployments, preparing for a large-scale attack. (1) In the Dehui area, the 50th Division of the Kuomintang New 1st Army advanced to the bank of the Songhua River on the 10th of last month, and stationed a regiment in Dehui, near Kaoshan Tun and Chenjia Shaoguo in the northwest. The rest were stationed along the highway from Xinglong Temple to Qingshan via Kaoshan Tun. They are now actively building fortifications and sending a large number of agents across the Songhua River for reconnaissance activities. The military department led the New 38th Division and the New 30th Division. After occupying Sipingjie and Changchun, they were transferred south to Yingkou, Anshan, and Haicheng, occupied Yingchengzi and Tangwang Mountain, and advanced towards Ximucheng, appearing ready to cooperate with the main force of the 52nd Army in attacking Andong. (2) The main force of the Kuomintang 52nd Army in the Benxi and Liaoyang areas was fully assembled at the beginning of last month in Qiaotou, Langzishan, and Daanping, and advanced towards our army's positions south of Qiaotou. It is said that they will soon cooperate with the New 1st Army in attacking Andong. Its 195th Division in Meihekou once attempted to occupy Qingyuan but failed. It is now under the command of the 60th Army, and appears ready to cooperate with the Provisional 21st Division in attacking Tonghua for the second time, seeking to open up the Fu (Shun) Mei (HeKou) line. (3) The Kuomintang 88th Division, entrenched along the Jilin-Laoye Ridge line, is now extensively building fortifications, preparing to attack again. (4) The Provisional 22nd Division of the Kuomintang 93rd Army is currently cooperating with the Provisional 18th Division near Jianchang in attacking our army on the border of Rehe and Liaoning. (5) The 89th Division of the Kuomintang 13th Army, confronting our army between Lingyuan and Yebaishou, is now assembling a large number of tanks and vehicles, and it is said that it will launch an attack on our army on the Ye (Baishou) Chi (Feng) line in the coming days. (6) To coordinate with its military offensive, Kuomintang aircraft have recently flown to Wuchang, Youlan, and Jiaohe to conduct demonstrations and reconnaissance.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Northeast News: Liao Yaoxiang, Commander of the Kuomintang New 6th Army, inspected his troops in Changchun yesterday. Military vehicles have been rumbling on the roads of Changchun for days, and the atmosphere of civil war is tense.
