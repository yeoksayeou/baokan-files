　　The Reign of Murderers
    *Liberation Daily* Editorial

    The bloodstains of Mr. Li Gongpu have not yet dried, and another peaceful democratic fighter, a mentor of the youth movement and first-rate poet and renowned professor, Mr. Wen Yiduo, has been brutally shot to death by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in the streets of Kunming!

    Mr. Wen's murder is an extremely serious criminal act! Even the spokesmen of the Kuomintang Kunming Garrison Headquarters and Propaganda Department cannot deny this. The Kuomintang authorities, deeply fearing that this crime will inevitably further arouse the anger of righteous people across the country, are hypocritically declaring that they will "strictly arrest the murderers" in an attempt to cover up the main culprits and shirk responsibility. But who doesn't know that in a thoroughfare teeming with soldiers and police, such brazen acts of violence could only be carried out by the fascist secret service organization headed by Chiang Kai-shek? No matter how the Kuomintang authorities quibble and deny it, they can never cover up this universally known truth: the murderers who plotted to kill Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo are none other than the Chiang Kai-shek fascist ruling clique. This group has murdered Liao Zhongkai, Deng Yanda, Yang Xing, Shi Liangcai, Li Zhaolin, Wang Ren, Sun Ping, and thousands upon thousands of other democratic patriots. The history of the past nineteen years has increasingly proven that Chiang Kai-shek's rule is a fascist murderer's rule, Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "military and political orders" are the military and political orders of a fascist murderer, and Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "national unification" is the national unification of a fascist murderer. Precisely because of this, Chiang Kai-shek resolutely opposes the people's politics, resolutely opposes the people's military and political orders – the ceasefire agreement and the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and resolutely opposes the people's democratic unification. I ask you, if today there were no liberated areas to leave a pure and bright land for China, if Chiang Kai-shek were allowed to unify China by force (the place where Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were murdered—Yunnan—was recently "unified" by Chiang Kai-shek), then the whole of China would become a world of murderers, and could people from all walks of life and all intellectuals have a safe place to live?

    The murders of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, separated by only three days, show how urgently the Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique is carrying out its terror campaign! One bloody hand of Chiang Kai-shek is wantonly murdering peaceful and democratic people in its ruling areas; the other bloody hand is launching a frenzied civil war against the liberated areas. The people of the whole country should clearly recognize that the murders of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen are a signal for civil war, and should smash this plan by strengthening the great unity of patriotism throughout the country a thousandfold! As the CCP's July 7th Declaration said, "The struggle of the people in the liberated areas and the struggle of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are joining together into a prairie fire of anger!" A small group of fascists is extremely insignificant in the face of this prairie fire of anger! They overestimate their capabilities, trying to suppress the national people's peaceful democratic movement with bloody terror, which only serves to reveal their desperate situation! No matter how they struggle, China's feudal comprador fascist system is destined to be burned clean by the people's prairie fire of anger! The cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy will surely triumph!

    Finally, we would like to say a few words to our American friends: Mr. Wen Yiduo was a famous liberal professor educated in the United States, who made brilliant contributions to the exchange of Sino-American culture. The Chiang Kai-shek ruling clique's murder of Mr. Wen is not only a challenge to the Chinese people by a few dictators, but also a challenge to the democracy of the Chinese and American people and the friendship between the Chinese and American people by German-Italian style barbaric fascism. In response to this challenge, American friends must also unite and give a resolute answer! That is to demand that the American authorities immediately stop all aid to Chiang Kai-shek's murderous government, withdraw the military aid to Chiang bill, and withdraw the American army, navy, and air force stationed in China.

　　杀人犯的统治
    解放日报社论
    李公朴先生的血迹未干，另一位和平民主战士青年运动的导师和第一流诗人、名教授闻一多先生又惨遭蒋记特务的乱枪射击，惨死在昆明的街头！
    闻先生的被害，是极端严重的罪恶行为！这一点，连国民党昆明警备司令部和宣传部的发言人，都无法加以否认。国民党当局深恐这一罪案必然更加激起全国正义人士的愤怒，因而不得不假惺惺地声明“严缉凶手”，企图掩盖主凶，推卸责任。但是，谁不知道在军警林立的通衢大道，肆无忌惮的行凶，除了以蒋介石为首的法西斯特务组织以外，还有什样人呢？不管国民党当局怎样狡辩抵赖，决然掩盖不了这一个人人皆知的真理，这个真理就是：谋害李公朴、闻一多两先生的杀人犯，正是蒋记法西斯统治集团。这个集团曾经谋害了廖仲恺、邓演达、杨杏、史量才、李兆麟、王任、孙平天等成千成万的民主志士。十九年来的历史，日益证明蒋介石的统治是法西斯杀人犯统治，蒋介石的所谓“军令政令”，就是法西斯杀人犯的军令政令，蒋介石的所谓“国家统一”，就是法西斯杀人犯的国家统一。正因为如此，蒋介石坚决反对人民的政治，坚决反对人民的军令政令——停战协定与政协决议，坚决反对人民的民主统一。试问今天如果没有解放区为中国留下一片光明净土，如果让蒋介石用武力统一中国（李、闻两先生被害地方——云南，就是不久前被蒋介石所“统一”去的），那末全中国将成为杀人犯的世界，各界人民及一切有思想有文化的人士，还能有安全生存的地方吗？
    李公朴、闻一多先生的被害，相隔不过三天，表示蒋介石统治集团的恐怖行动的步骤，是如何迫促！蒋介石的一支血手，对其所统治区内的和平民主人民，肆行杀害；另一支血手，则向解放区进行疯狂的内战。全国人民应当清楚认识：李、闻两先生的被害，是内战的信号，应当以千百倍的加强全国爱国主义的大团结，来粉碎这个计划！正如中共七七宣言所说，“解放区人民的斗争，和国民党统治区域人民的斗争，正在联为一片燎原的怒火！”一小群法西斯分子，在这燎原的怒火前，是极其渺小的！他们不自量力，想以血腥恐怖，来镇压全国人民的和平民主运动，适足以表现他们日暮途穷的窘态！不管他们怎样挣扎，中国的封建买办法西斯主义，是注定了要被人民的燎原怒火所焚毁干净！中国人民的独立和平民主事业，必然胜利！
    最后我们还想对美国友人说几句话：闻一多先生是在美国受教育的著名的自由主义教授，对于中美文化的交流有光辉的贡献。蒋介石统治集团杀害闻先生，不仅是少数独裁者对中国人民的挑战，而且还是德意式的野蛮法西斯主义，对中美人民的民主主义和中美人民友谊的挑战。对于这个挑战，美国友人亦要一致起来，予以坚决的回答！那就是：要求美国当局立即停止对蒋介石杀人犯政府的任何援助，撤回军事援蒋法案，撤回驻华美海陆空军。
