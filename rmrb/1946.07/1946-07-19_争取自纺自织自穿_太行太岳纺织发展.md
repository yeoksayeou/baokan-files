　　Strive for Spinning, Weaving, and Clothing Self-Sufficiency
    Textile Development in Taihang and Taiyue

    [Our Special Dispatch] Under the slogan of "Spinning, Weaving, and Clothing Self-Sufficiency," the textile industry in the Taihang and Taiyue regions has developed rapidly. In the Sixth District of Taiyue's Shimin area, out of a total of 1,435 women, only 80 in places like Miaogou could spin and 37 could weave before the establishment of the democratic government. The rest of the women relied on buying cloth to make clothes and thread to sew. Now, 973 women can spin and 95 can weave, more than ten times the pre-war level. Guo Wenhua's group in Dongjiashan Village has grown to 136 people since last winter. Many people have become prosperous and wear new clothes through spinning and weaving. Guo Wenhua's family now has two looms, and has produced 15 bolts of cloth since last winter. The two members of his family each made a set of cotton clothes and two sets of single-layer clothes this spring. All the grain needed by the family can be supplied by textile production. In the first district of Ping Shun in Taihang, there were 2,483 spinning women and 491 weaving women last winter. Now, there are 605 new spinning women and 123 new weaving women. There were 223 flat looms and 16 hand looms. 60 flat looms and 53 hand looms were newly added. In four months, a total of 13,064 catties of cotton were spun and 6,630 feet of cloth were woven, earning a total of 800,370 yuan. Beiliu Village in Licheng alone has 280 spinning wheels, 51 looms, 4 cotton gins, and 2 cotton sorters, earning more than 85,000 yuan last winter. Li Jilian from Xia Village couldn't afford cotton clothes in the winter of 1943, but now she has solved her livelihood through spinning and weaving. She has enough to eat and wear, and has also bought three mu of land and built a new house. With the development of the mass textile movement, small textile factories have developed, and the Yuji Spinning Factory in Zanhuang is a typical example. The factory is cooperative in nature, with 60 workers, who are also the shareholders. It has a total capital of 3 million yuan and produces 30 dozen towels and one large bolt each of wide and narrow cloth per day. In order to promote the rural textile movement, the factory recently bought back six looms from Gaoyang, purchased relatively coarse yarn, and wove carpets and cloth bags, so that many women who are new to weaving would not be unable to sell their finished products due to poor skills. They also held a training class to train technicians in weaving silk bottom nets, silk handkerchiefs, and knitting silk (a special product of Zanhuang). The privately-owned Changzhi Yihe Dyeing and Weaving Factory has been revived with the assistance of the democratic government. Wang Fengtong, the manager of the factory, has re-emerged the hosiery machines, towel machines, rib machines, and glove machines that had been buried for seven or eight years. The sixteen technicians who used to run dyeing and weaving factories in Tianjin are now back to work using their familiar machines. They deeply realize the Communist Party's policy of developing private capital. Wang Fengtong once said: "As long as we follow the democratic government, the factory can make money." With the development of the textile industry, cotton fields have been expanded unprecedentedly, providing more than sufficient conditions for the textile industry in the future. This year, the cotton planting area in Taihang has exceeded 1.5 million mu. In Lang Village, Licheng, 56% of the autumn land in the entire village has become cotton fields; in Xihuangzhang Village, Zuoquan, the cotton field has exceeded six times that of last year; in the Niufa Mutual Aid Group in Lujiakou Village, Pingshun, each household plants an average of two mu of cotton.

　　争取自纺自织自穿
    太行太岳纺织发展
    【本报特讯】太行太岳两区，在“自纺自织自穿”的口号下，纺织业获得迅速发展。太岳士敏六区，全区共有妇女一千四百三十五人，在民主政府未建立前，只庙沟等地八十人会纺，三十七人会织，其余妇女均靠买布裁衣，买线缝衣，现在已有九百七十三名妇女会纺，九十五人会织，超过战前十倍。董家山村郭文华组，从去冬至今，发展至一百三十六人。许多人都经过纺织发了家，穿了新衣。郭文华家现有织机两架，去冬至今，下布十五匹，他家两口人每人做棉衣一套，今春又做单衣两套，全家所须粮食，可由纺织供给。太行平顺一区去冬有纺妇二千四百八十三人，织妇四百九十一人，现已新增纺妇六百零五人，织妇一百二十三人。原有平机二百二十三架，手机十六架，新增平机六十架，手机五十三架。四个月共纺花一万三千零六十四斤，织布六千六百三十斤，共赚洋八十万零三千七百元。黎城北流一村即有纺车二百八十辆，织布机五十一架，轧花机四辆，拣花机二辆，去冬赚洋八万五千余元。霞村李季莲，四三年冬天还穿不上棉衣，现在靠纺织解决了自己的生活。够吃够穿，还买了三亩地，修了一座新房。随着群众性的纺织运动的发展，小型的纺织工厂已发展起来，赞皇的裕记纺纱工厂即是典型例子。该厂是合作性质，有工人六十个，股东就是他们自己，共有资本三百万元，日产毛巾三十打，宽窄面布各一大匹。为促进乡村纺织运动，该厂最近从高阳买回织布机六架，收买比较粗的纱线，织花毯和布袋，使许多初学纺织的妇女，不致因技术低劣而无法销售自己的成品。他们还举行了一个训练班，训练织丝箩底、绸手帕和编绸（赞皇特产）的技术人员。私人经营的长治义合染织厂已在民主政府的资助下，复兴起来。该厂经理王凤桐，将埋藏了七八年的织袜机、织毛巾机、罗纹机、手套机重新搬了出来，以前在天津开染织厂的十六位技术工人，现都运用他们自己熟习的机器复工，他们深深体会到共产党的发展私人资本的政策，王凤桐曾说：“只要跟民主政府走，工厂就能赚钱”。随着纺织业之发展，棉田已空前扩大，给今后纺织业更加准备了充分的条件。太行今年棉田播种面积已超过一百五十万亩，黎城郎村全村秋地百分之五十六成为棉田；左权西黄漳村，棉田超过去年六倍；平顺路家口村牛发则互助组每户平均植棉二亩。
