[Report from our Changzhi Office] The second Middle School Principals' Conference convened by the Taihang Administrative Office's Education Department concluded successfully on the 20th after lasting eleven days. Twenty-one principals and vice-principals from thirteen middle schools attended the conference, and Director Chao of the Border Region Government's Education Department also attended to provide guidance. At the meeting, the achievements of each middle school in the previous semester were reviewed, and a new education plan was studied and approved based on half a year of experience. In the past six months, due to the widespread development of production and mass movements, the emancipated peasants in the new areas have also been freed from the shackles of the enemy, puppet, and feudal forces for the past seven or eight years. The masses' demand for cultural learning has generally increased, and the number of students in schools has surged. The number of middle schools in the entire region has increased to fifteen, a fourfold increase compared to before the counter-offensive (only three before the counter-offensive), with more than 3,500 male and female students. There have also been many new creations in teaching methods.

During the first three days of the conference, the schools reported and exchanged teaching experiences: for example, students at the Changzhi Agricultural Vocational School visited labor heroes and conducted field internships, combining books with practice; the Second Middle School combined production with learning; and the Third Middle School students organized learning mutual aid groups, creating many new experiences that combined with actual production. All schools adopted the principle of "less but精" in class, focusing on practical knowledge, especially the study of production knowledge. All schools have student self-government associations, fully promoting a democratic style, especially the self-study movement at Zhangbin Middle School, which has been very effective. The reports raised questions about the direction of the school system and curriculum—whether to pursue further education or employment after graduation? What kind of talents should be cultivated? What level of work ability and cultural knowledge should cadre middle schools cultivate in students?

On the fourth day, Director Chao gave detailed instructions on the direction of middle school education based on these issues, pointing out that our secondary education is cadre education, "graduation is employment," and therefore it is not only for further education, but to cultivate working cadres. He said: The old society ran schools for the sake of running schools, creating the phenomenon of "graduation is unemployment," and was not responsible for the needs of society and the future of students. We run education for the people, so we should systematically cultivate various production and construction talents, administrative cadres, and new teachers. Director Chao called for "vocationalizing middle schools" to cultivate students' labor habits and production skills. He called for "combining teaching, learning, and doing," and learning from practice. Students in the old areas should learn from the great production movement; students in the new areas should participate in the mass emancipation movement and learn from mass movements.

On the fifth and sixth days of the conference, groups discussed Director Chao's instructions and, based on this, drafted a new education plan for school vocationalization with historical and revolutionary significance. On the ninth day, Comrade Leng Chu, Minister of Propaganda of the Taihang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave a current affairs report and put forward specific opinions on the implementation of the middle school education policy. Zhao, Director of the Administrative Office's Education Department, summarized the meeting, calling on everyone to clarify the concept of education serving the people, implement the new education plan, boldly create teaching methods, and promptly exchange experiences among schools.

　　太行中学校长会议
    研究通过教育新方案           
    确定中学职业化培养各种建设人材
    【本报长治讯】太行行署教育处召开之第二次中学校长会议，历时十一日，已于二十日圆满闭幕。这次会议有十三个中学校的正副校长共二十一人出席，边府教育厅晁厅长亦亲临指导。会议上检查了上学期各中学成绩，并根据半年的经验，研究通过了教育新方案。半年来由于生产群运的普遍开展，新区翻身农民也解脱了七八年来敌伪封建枷锁，群众文化学习要求普遍提高，因之学校学生数目激增，全区中学增至十五所，比反攻前增四倍（反攻前仅三所），男女学生三千五百余人。在教学方法上也有不少新创造。会议前三日，各校报告交流教学经验：如长治农职学校学生访问劳动英雄及田间实习，把书本与实际结合；二中生产与学习结合；三中学生组织学习互助组等，创造了不少与生产实际结合的新经验。各校上课均采取少而精的原则，着重实际知识，特别是生产知识的学习，各校均有学生自治会，充分发扬民主作风，特别是漳滨中学的自学运动收效很大。报告中提出了学制与课程的方针问题——毕业后是升学或是就业？培养什么人材？干部中学对学生工作能力与文化程度究应培养到何种水准等问题。第四日晁厅长根据这些问题，对中学教育方针作详细的指示，指出我们的中等教育即是干部教育，“毕业即就业”，因之不只是为了升学，而是为了培养工作干部。他说：旧社会为办学而办学，造成“毕业即失业”的现象，对社会需要与学生前途不负责任。我们为人民办教育，就应有计划的培养各种生产建设人材，行政干部与新的师资。晃厅长号召“中学职业化”，培养学生劳动习惯与生产技能。号召“教、学、做合一”，向实际学习。老区学生应向大生产运动中学习；新区应参加群众翻身运动，向群运学习。大会第五、六两日分组讨论晁厅长指示，并据此拟出富有历史改革性的学校职业化的新教育方案。第九日邀请中共太行区党委宣传部长冷楚同志作时事报告，并对实施中学教育方针提出具体意见。行署赵教育处长为会议作总结，号召大家明确教育服务人民的观念，贯彻新教育方案，大胆创造教学办法，及时交流各校经验。
