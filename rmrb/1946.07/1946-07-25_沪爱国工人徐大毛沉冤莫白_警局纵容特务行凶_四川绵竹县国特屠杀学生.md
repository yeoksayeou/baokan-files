Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Shanghai News: On June 23rd, when 100,000 people in Shanghai held a patriotic demonstration against the civil war, a large number of special agents and thugs caused trouble along the way, and threw spittoons, soda bottles and other objects from the YMCA building to attack the demonstrators. The demonstration guards captured seven special agents and thugs, including Zhang Yong and Jin Rong, who committed the violence, and sent them to the police station, requesting that they be punished according to law. Unexpectedly, the police station released all the special agents and thugs. Four patriotic workers, Xu Damao, Diao Minzhi, Zhu Caisheng, and Ruan Guangyu, who opposed the escort of the special agents and thugs, were illegally detained and then transferred to the local court, which surprisingly filed a public prosecution, accusing Xu and others of "assaulting" Zhang Yong and other special agents and thugs. After two trials by the local court, without distinguishing between right and wrong, it pronounced a sentence on the morning of the 10th, sentencing Xu Damao to one year and six months of imprisonment, Diao Minzhi and Zhu Caisheng to eight months each, and Ruan Guangyu to three months. It also ordered Xu and others to "compensate" Zhang Yong and other special agents and thugs for "loss of medical expenses" amounting to 687,000 legal tender. All sectors of Shanghai are indignant at the Kuomintang authorities' crime of slander and framing innocent people, and expressed their determination to fully support Xu Damao and others.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: Chongqing News: A bloody tragedy of school authorities colluding with armed plainclothes agents to arrest and massacre students recently occurred at Xiaogan Teachers College in Mianzhu County, Sichuan Province. It was because the school principal, Wang Chengde, embezzled funds, abused vulgar teachers, and organized a "school protection group" of members who carried guns in class to suppress students. The students of the school requested improvement of the school rules, but the principal ignored them, and all the students went on strike on the 11th of last month. The next day, the principal and the head of Xiaogan Township gathered more than 30 plainclothes agents, holding guns and sticks, and rushed into the school to suppress the student movement. Student Xiao Yaoguang was shot and wounded, and then severely beaten and arrested. Ren Jingji was beaten and arrested, Tang Hecun was beaten, and more than a dozen others were missing, and eight were expelled.
