　　Taiyue Our Army Recovers Jingsheng
    A Company of Puppet Sun Dianying's Troops Surrenders to Us, Kuomintang Troops Attack Eastern Manchuria

    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 5th]: Jingsheng Town, Lingshi, in the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, was once again recovered by our army on the 1st of this month through resolute self-defense. The town is a major town northeast of Lingshi. After the Yan Xishan troops invaded and occupied the area on the 5th of last month, they used it as a base for advancing on our Lingshi Liberated Area. More than 50 innocent local people were arrested and killed. In order to protect the interests of the local people, our army resolutely carried out a self-defense counterattack on July 1st and recovered Jingsheng Town. Over 100 Yan Xishan troops were killed or wounded, 210 were captured, and one mortar, 11 light machine guns, four grenade launchers, over 100 rifles, and 80,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.

    [This newspaper, Heze, 3rd]: Soldiers of the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion of the puppet Sun Dianying's troops in Xinxiang, northern Henan, unwilling to serve as tools of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the civil war, staged a mutiny on the 21st of last month, killing the company commander who ruled the company. All the soldiers then surrendered with their weapons to our Jilu Yu Eighth Route Army.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 5th]: Along the Jiao-Ji Railway, the 308th Regiment of the Kuomintang's 8th Army, which advanced westward from Changyi area to attack the central Shandong Liberated Area, attempted to incorporate the puppet self-defense regiment stationed at Fangzi Railway Station in mid-last month in order to expand its civil war strength. The more than 200 members of the regiment, unwilling to be used as cannon fodder for warmongers, surrendered to our Eighth Route Army with all their weapons under the leadership of Captain Shan Zhi.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 4th]: The Eighth Route Army guarding Jimo City in the Jiaodong Liberated Area, after dealing a powerful blow to the invading Kuomintang army, withdrew from the city on the 2nd of this month. The city was recovered for the third time by the Eighth Route Army from the entrenched puppet troops on the 16th of last month. However, the Kuomintang authorities recklessly expanded the civil war in Shandong. Since the 18th of last month, the 54th Army, newly transported by US warships with all of its US-equipped equipment, combined with the puppet troops of Zhang Qilu, launched a fierce attack on Jimo, repeatedly encountered heroic counterattacks by the Eighth Route Army, successively annihilating four of its battalions, defeating two of its regiments, and giving a powerful blow to the invading army. On the 2nd, they safely withdrew from Jimo City and continued to resist.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, 4th]: The Kuomintang army began attacking our Democratic United Army in the eastern Manchuria area again on June 30th. The Kuomintang army regiment in Dongfeng, with two artillery pieces attached, invaded Dayang and Weicun on the 30th, occupying the villages, and seemed to be continuing to advance south towards Liuhe and Tonghua. At 12:00 on July 1st, two Kuomintang planes had already flown to the Liuhe and Tonghua lines for reconnaissance. In addition, Kuomintang troops from Xifeng and Xi'an each dispatched a part of their forces, meeting 20 miles west of Yangmulin, and attacked the Liaobei Democratic United Army.
