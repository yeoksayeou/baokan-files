Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 19th: Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu sent a telegram on the 17th to express condolences to the family of Wen Yiduo. The original telegram is as follows: To the family of Mr. Wen Yiduo, c/o National Southwest Associated University, Kunming: We are deeply saddened to learn of Mr. Yiduo's passing. Mr. Yiduo fought for democracy with unwavering dedication, deserving our respect and admiration. Now that he has been murdered by treacherous individuals, patriots across the country will surely carry on his legacy, redouble their efforts, and strive to bring the democratic cause to a successful conclusion. We send our condolences via telegram!
                                    Mao Zedong, Zhu De, July 17th

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 19th: Nanjing dispatch: After the murders of Mr. Wen Yiduo and Mr. Li Gongpu, the entire city of Kunming has been shrouded in an atmosphere of terror. Under the rule of the Nanjing "murderer" government, the people's lives and freedoms are completely unprotected. Professor Pan Guangdan and others have been forced to request protection from the American consulate. Foreign reporters in Nanjing questioned Peng Xuepei, the Minister of Propaganda of the Kuomintang, about this on the 17th. Peng shamelessly stated: "We can grant him protection from others whom he desires," meaning that he is willing to cede the responsibility of protecting the people's lives and safety to foreigners.

　　毛主席朱总司令电唁闻一多家属
    【新华社延安十九日电】毛主席、朱总司令十七日电唁闻一多氏家属，原电如下：昆明国立西南联大请转闻一多先生家属：惊悉一多先生被害，至深哀悼。先生为民主而奋斗，不屈不挠，可敬可佩，今遭奸人毒手，全国志士必将继先生遗志，再接再厉，务使民主事业克底于成。特电致唁！
                                     毛泽东  朱德  七月十七日
    【新华社延安十九日电】南京讯：闻一多、李公朴两氏遇害后，昆明全市已为恐怖空气笼罩。在南京“杀人犯”政府统治之下，人民生命自由毫无保障，潘光旦教授等被迫不得不请求美领事馆予以保护。南京外籍记者对此，曾于十七日向国民党宣传部长彭学沛提出质问，彭竟恬不知耻的称：“可予以其本人所希望之其他人保护”，意即表明愿意将保护人民生命安全之权责，让给外国人。
