　　The 17th Division of the National Revolutionary Army
    Declaration Commemorating the "July 17th" Uprising

    Today marks the first anniversary of the Luoning Uprising of our division. At this moment when the dictator is ruining the country, the flames of civil war are raging, and the national crisis is severe, we wish to present to our elders, brothers, sisters, and kinsfolk the deeds of our officers and soldiers in the service of the nation and the heartfelt intentions behind the Luoning Uprising. This may be of some small help to the nation's affairs; and we hope that our comrades across the country will further instruct us.

    Our division was originally established by General Yang Hucheng, and initially served as the first detachment of the Third Route Army of the Jingguo Army under the leadership of Mr. Yu Youren. We were exposed to Sun Yat-sen's ideology early on, developing into a revolutionary armed force in the Northwest. It has been almost thirty years!

    The fighting over the past thirty years has been a glorious road, but also filled with indignation and bitterness!

    Recalling the era of warlord melee in the Northern Warlord period, we adhered to the revolutionary banner and resisted the feudal warlords. In the turbulent waves, General Yang initially fought alone with only five battalions, fighting in the border area between Shaanxi and Mongolia. Later, with a brigade of troops, he resisted an army of 100,000, and defended the isolated city of Xi'an for eight months in order to coordinate with the Northern Expeditionary Army to maintain the strategic revolutionary base in the Northwest. Although ammunition and food were exhausted, to the point of eating grass roots and tree bark, our fighting spirit did not wane. Finally, we defeated the Zhen Song Army, went east through Tongguan, and participated in the Northern Expedition.

    Unfortunately, during the ten-year civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, we were once forced by "military orders" to obey with tears and help the tyrant to do evil, depleting national strength. Even thinking about it now, there is still lingering pain. However, patriotic men who truly embraced Sun Yat-sen's ideology could not be deceived for long. After the "September 18th" Incident, we felt deeply the national crisis and the harm to the country and the people caused by the "non-resistance policy" and the "internal pacification before external resistance policy." The entire army unanimously demanded "the cessation of the civil war and the turning of guns outward." Thus, there was the "Xi'an Incident" led by Generals Zhang and Yang. Upright and open, the purpose was to stop the civil war and unite for national salvation. History has already proven whether it was meritorious or a mistake. The experiences of Generals Zhang and Yang over the past ten years have caused all patriotic sons and daughters to shed tears of sympathy. The one who issued the orders cited "national law" and then "family law." May I ask: Whose country is it? And whose family? And whose law? It is nothing more than the tradition of Louis XVI, "I am the state," the intention of the Qing Dynasty "rather give it to foreigners than to family slaves," and the mantle of the Fascist "leader!" There is nothing else!

    When the "July 7th" Incident occurred, General Zhao Shoushan was the first to volunteer to kill the enemy, leading his troops to the front line in North China. In the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, he defended Baoding, held Niangziguan, and fought bravely in Xuehua Mountain. In the twenty-seventh year, he fought in southeastern Shanxi. After that, he guarded Fengmenkou, trapped the enemy in Jiyuan, crushed nine enemy sweeps, and defended Zhongtiao Mountain for more than two years. In the twenty-ninth year, he took over the defense of Gong, Yan, Xing, Si, and Guangwu, confronting the enemy who had captured Zhengzhou on the line between the cities of Bawang and Han for as long as two years. The enemy could not cross the Lei Pool even one step. In the thirty-third year, during the Central Plains Campaign, Tang Enbo fled without a fight. Our army guarded Hulao alone, fighting fiercely for nineteen days and nights, remaining unyielding. When Luoyang fell and orders were given to break through, most of our 90th Regiment died heroically, and the rest were heavily casualties. Afterwards, without even time to reorganize, we continued to fight constantly. In summary, during the eight years, we fought in the three provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan, without leaving the front line even one step. It can be said that we have barely fulfilled our duty to protect the country and defend the people, and have not disgraced the tradition of the Northwest National Army. At the same time, it also proves that our participation in the "Xi'an Incident" stemmed from the interests of the nation and the country, and not from the private interests of any small group, which can be made clear to the world. Those who falsely accused us, let them be.

    Recalling the past, we dare not claim credit. It was our duty to serve on the battlefield. What we cannot help but say is that since the Anti-Japanese War, the central authorities have spoken daily of "national law and military discipline," but in reality, right and wrong have been reversed, military discipline has been lost, and national law no longer exists. Those who resolutely fought bravely were punished, while those who deserted before the battle were rewarded. Looking at the Central Plains Campaign, Tang Enbo, who fled without a fight, retreated a hundred miles a day, and lost six cities in seven days, not only continued to occupy high positions, but was also given comfort and encouragement. And the cadres of our division, who persisted in resisting the enemy and fought bitterly, were forced into concentration camps on "trumped-up" charges! The warriors were disheartened, and those who heard it shed tears. What was the intention behind such retrograde acts? How can they still speak of "national law and military discipline," where is the "decorum"? What is regrettable is that even though they are all national armies, there is a distinction between "direct lineage" and "miscellaneous troops," and among the direct lineage and miscellaneous troops, there are also differences in favor and disfavor. The treatment is different, the equipment is different, and the use is also different. Pampering the direct lineage and oppressing the miscellaneous troops, everything is done. The cruel methods against "miscellaneous troops" cannot be described in words, such as trapping them in hunger and cold, prohibiting replenishment, or using temptations to disintegrate them, or swallowing them up under the pretext of reorganization, or even deliberately placing them in a dead end in battle, without providing rescue, not hesitating to "borrow the enemy's knife to kill people." Such examples are too numerous to mention, which cannot be described by comrades-in-arms of the "direct lineage." Taking our division as an example, during the operation in Henan, only four taels of straw sandals were issued in three months; soldiers were taught to eat grass to get fat, just like livestock; during the eight years of combat, the losses were heavy, but the annual supplies never exceeded hundreds of guns; when fighting in Zhongtiao Mountain, we were subjected to crossfire and strafing from Hu Zongnan across the river; during the battle to defend Zheng Guang, we fought fiercely with 40,000 enemies for nearly a month, the disparity in strength was vast, and the casualties were heavy, but we received no assistance; when we were defending the line of Shan Xiaoguan and Hulaoguan, we were abandoned by the fleeing general; when we broke through Xin'an and were tragically bombed, the "direct lineage" generals clapped their hands and exclaimed with delight: "This has finally annihilated the main force of the 17th Division!" The lack of conscience of people can be described as extreme. As for the long imprisonment of General Yang Hucheng, the tearful farewell of General Zhao Shoushan, and the detention of cadres in the Xi'an concentration camp, these are even more things that we cannot bear to recall! What is even more regrettable is that reactionary elements, although timid in resisting the enemy, are brave in civil war. Combined with their policy towards "miscellaneous troops," they often drive "miscellaneous troops" to the forefront of the anti-communist and anti-people civil war, which is known as "killing two birds with one stone." Is this true? When the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was attacked in July of the 34th year of the Republic of China, strict orders were also issued to our division in western Henan to attack the Eighth Route Army in western Henan. To endure seeing the great enemy at hand, the mountains and rivers shattered, and to turn our guns around to harm our compatriots was already the most tragic thing in the world, let alone against the People's Armed Forces, the Eighth Route Army, who were loyal and brave in resisting the war and recovering the land! This is what all the officers and soldiers of the division could not help but stamp their feet and cry out loud at this time last year! To advance is to become a traitor to the people, to retreat is to be robbed and killed. Forced into this situation, what choice is there? Wumu's foolish loyalty only increases national disaster. To disarm and return home is not yet the time. Tears welling up and unable to endure any longer, we had no choice but to reject the chaotic orders, escape the prison, seek another battlefield, and continue to confront the enemy. This is the origin of the Luoning Uprising of our division in the 34th year of the Republic of China on "July 17th," turning to the liberated areas. There is no other aspiration, for the nation, for the country, to demand unity against the enemy, and to oppose dictatorship and civil war. It is still the consistent proposition of the "Xi'an Incident," and we are still worthy of the glorious revolutionary tradition of our Northwest Armed Forces. As long as there is a breath left, we will forever fight with weapons for the independence, freedom, and democracy of the nation and the country. We hope that the people and gentlemen of the country will discern and support us.

    We are grateful for the care of the vast compatriots in the liberated areas, and we are grateful for the support and help of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army. The appeal of the democratic policies of the liberated areas has especially allowed us to fortunately obtain a new world, and we vow to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Eighth Route Army to defend the peace and democracy won through bloody struggle.

    We extend our condolences and respect to General Gao Shuxun, General Pan Shuoduan, and all the comrades of the Democratic National Construction Army and the Democratic League Army. Let us join hands and strive for our common goal!

    We remotely report to Mr. Yu Youren, General Yang Hucheng, General Sun Weiru, General Zhao Shoushan, and all the former advanced comrades that we will never fail to live up to the nurturing, carry forward the glorious tradition of the Northwest National Army, and spare no effort to shed the last drop of blood for the independence and freedom of the nation and the country and to save our Northwest compatriots!

    We firmly believe in the brightness and victory of the future!

                                            Zhang Fuzhen
                                            Liu Weicheng leads all officers and soldiers in respectful declaration
                                            Liang Lisheng
                                                   July 17th

　　国民革命军陆军第十七师
    纪念“七一七”起义宣言
    今日为本师洛宁起义一周年。值此独夫祸国，内战烽火弥漫，民族危机严重之际，愿将我全师官兵为民族国家之事迹与洛宁起义之衷曲，简陈于父老兄弟诸姑姊姝之前，或对蜩螳之国事，不无小补；并望全国袍泽进而教之。
    本师始建于杨虎城将军，初为于右任先生领导下靖国军第三路之第一支队，早沐中山主义，蔚为西北革命武装，屈指已近三十年矣！
    三十年来奋斗过程是光荣道路，但亦充满愤慨与辛酸！
    回忆在北洋军阀混战时代，坚持革命旗帜，反抗封建军阀，浊浪滔天中，杨将军始则以五营之众孤军奋斗，转战陕蒙边境；继以一旅之兵，抗十万之师，为策应北伐军保持西北革命战略要地而坚守西安孤城至八阅月之久，虽弹尽粮绝至以草根树皮为食，而斗志不衰，终于击溃镇嵩军，东出潼关，参与北伐。
    不幸在国共十年内战中，一度迫于“军令”，忍泣服从，助纣作恶，损耗国力。至今思之，犹有余痛。但真正服膺中山主义之爱国男儿终非可久被欺蒙者，“九一八”后，痛感国难深重与“不抵抗主义”，“先安内而后攘外政策”之祸国殃民，全军上下一致要求“停止内战枪口对外”，于是有张杨两将军领导下之“双十二兵谏”。磊落光明，旨在停止内战，团结救亡。为功为过，历史已有证明。张杨两将军十余年来之遭遇，凡属爱国儿女，当无不为洒同情之泪也，彼发令者一则曰“国法”，再则曰“家法”，试问：伊谁之国？又伊谁之家？又伊谁之法？路易十六，“朕即国家”之传统，满清“宁送外人不与家奴”之居心，及法西斯“元首”之衣钵耳，宁复有他！
    “七七”变起，赵寿山将军首先请缨杀敌，率部奔赴华北前线。抗战初期保卫保定，坚守娘子关，奋战雪花山。二十七年转战于晋东南。其后守御封门口，困敌济源，粉碎敌九次扫荡，保卫中条两年有余。二十九年接防巩、偃、荥、汜、及广武一带，与陷郑州之敌相持于霸王汉王两城之线者达二年之久，敌未能越雷池一步。三十三年中原会战，汤恩伯不战而逃，本军孤守虎牢，苦战十九昼夜，屹然不动；适洛阳失守，奉令突围，我九十团大部壮烈殉难，余亦伤亡惨重。是后未遑整理，犹复不断作战。综计八年之中，转战冀晋豫三省，未离前线一步，可谓已勉尽保国卫民之天职，不辱西北国民军之传统；同时亦证明吾人之所以参加“双十二”兵谏，出发于为民族国家，而非为任何小集团之私利，更可大白于天下。彼故加之罪者，听之而已。
    缅述往事，非敢言功，效命疆场，原属本分。所不能已于言者：抗战以来、中枢当局日言“国法军纪”而实际则是非颠倒，军纪荡然，国法无存。坚决奋战者有罚，临战脱逃者则赏。试看中原会战、不战而逃，日蹙百里，七日失六城之汤恩伯，不仅始终窃踞高位，且慰勉有加。而坚持抗敌浴血苦斗之本师干部则反以“莫须有”之罪名，被逼入集中营！壮士心寒，闻者落泪，如此逆行，是何居心？尚复昌言“国法军纪”，“体统”何存？所可痛者：同为国军竟有嫡系、杂牌之分，而嫡系杂牌之中，又各有厚薄远近之别。待遇不同，装备不同，使用亦不同，娇养嫡系，压迫杂牌，均无所不至。其对“杂牌”之惨酷手段，非言语所能形容，如困以饥寒，禁予补充，或施以利诱瓦解，或借口改编吞并，甚至临战故置于死地，不予救援，不惜“借敌刀以杀人”。如斯事例，不胜枚举，非“嫡系”之袍泽类能道之。以本师言，河南作战中，三个月只发四两草鞋麻；士兵啼饥，曾被教以“牲口吃草可以肥，人吃草也可以上膘”；作战八年损失惨重，而历年补给曾不过数百枝枪，作战中条时遭过胡宗南之隔河夹击扫射，保卫郑广之役，与敌四万激战近月，众寡悬殊，死伤枕藉，不获援助；坚守山小关虎牢关之线时曾为逃将军所远远抛弃；新安突围与惨遭轰炸时，曾被“嫡系”将军拍手称快：“这一下才把十七师主力消灭啦！”人之无良可谓已极。至于杨虎城将军之久囚，赵寿山将军之泣别，干部之拘系西安集中营，则更非吾人之所忍忆想者矣！更可痛者：反动分子虽怯于抗敌，但勇于内战。结合其对待“杂牌”之政策，每驱“杂牌”于反共反人民内战之最前线，世称：“一箭双雕”，其信然欤？民国三十四年七月陕甘宁边区被进攻时，在豫西亦向本师发出进击豫西八路军之严令。忍看大敌当前山河破碎，而竟倒转枪口，自残同胞，已属人间之最凄惨事，更何况对于忠勇抗战复土有功之人民武装八路军！此去年此时全师官兵所不能不为之顿足失声者也！进为民贼，退遭抢杀，势逼处此，何所抉择？武穆愚忠，徒增国难，解甲归里、尚非其时。上下垂泪、忍无可忍，无已，只有拒绝乱命，脱彼囚笼，另觅战场，继续与敌周旋之一道。此即本师民国三十四年“七一七”洛宁起义转入解放区之由来也。矢志无他，为民族，为国家，要求团结御侮，反对独裁内战。犹是“双十二”兵谏之一贯主张，尚无愧于我西北武装之光荣革命传统。一息尚存，将永远为民族国家之独立自由民主而荷戈奋战。幸祈邦人君子鉴察而扶植之。
    感谢解放区广大同胞对我们之爱护，感谢共产党八路军对我们之扶植帮助。解放区民主政策之感召，尤使吾人幸得新天地，誓愿与八路军肩并肩为保卫此浴血苦斗而获得之和平民主而奋斗。
    致慰与致敬高树勋将军、潘朔端将军、及民主建国军民主同盟军之全体袍泽，大家携起手来，为吾人一致目标而努力！
    遥告于右任先生，杨虎城将军，孙蔚如将军，赵寿山将军及所有昔日诸先进袍泽，我们将永远不负培育，发扬西北国民军光荣传统，为民族国家之独立自由及为拯救我西北同胞不惜流尽最后一滴血！
    吾人坚决相信前途之光明与胜利！
                                            张复振
                                            刘威诚率全体官兵敬宣言
                                            梁励生
                                                   七月十七日
