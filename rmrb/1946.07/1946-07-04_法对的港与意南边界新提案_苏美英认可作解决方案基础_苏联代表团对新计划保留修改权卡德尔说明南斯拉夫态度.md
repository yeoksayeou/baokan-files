　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Paris - France's new proposal regarding Trieste and the Italian-Yugoslav border has been accepted by the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain as a basis for discussing the issue. The French proposal, presented at the meeting on the 29th, includes the following key points: Trieste and its neighboring area will be transformed into an autonomous region within ten years, jointly administered by the four powers and Italy and Yugoslavia. The territorial integrity of the region will be guaranteed by the United Nations Security Council. The French Foreign Minister stated that he hoped this plan could serve as the basis for new efforts. The Soviet delegation pointed out that the new plan was unsatisfactory because its implementation would violate the national sentiments of the Yugoslav people, and its temporary nature would create instability and particularly complex institutions. However, the Soviet representative believed that this suggestion provided a possibility for seeking a compromise and could be accepted as a basis for a solution. The Soviet delegation reserved the right to propose amendments after detailed study of the plan. The British and American delegations, without commenting on the key points of the new plan, stated that they were willing to study it. At the meeting on the 29th, a resolution was also passed to limit the Italian navy. Other issues concerning the future of the Italian navy have been entrusted to a committee of naval experts to prepare for a meeting. At the close of the meeting, the US representative proposed setting July 25th as the date for the peace conference. The Soviet delegation insisted on the previous decision that the peace conference should be held after the tasks entrusted to it by the foreign ministers' conference (i.e., preparing draft peace treaties) were completed, but believed that the issue of the conference date could be discussed within a few days.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Paris - Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj made a statement in Paris on June 27 regarding the issue of Trieste and the Italian-Yugoslav border. Kardelj pointed out that Yugoslavia cannot agree to the annexation of its main city, Trieste, nor can it agree to its seaport being seized. Yugoslavia will never sign or agree to any peace treaty that does not meet these legitimate demands. Kardelj said that recently a plan for the internationalization of Trieste has emerged, but Yugoslavia cannot accept this internationalization plan any more than it can accept Trieste being incorporated into Italy. Kardelj concluded by pointing out that Yugoslavia is prepared to use all its strength and adopt all possible means to reach an agreement on the Trieste and Julian issues as much as possible. Yugoslavia is prepared to undertake the necessary practical obligations to guarantee the complete autonomy of Julian, giving it the status of a federal republic. Yugoslavia is prepared to recognize the port of Trieste as a free port and is prepared to accept certain modifications to the western border to reduce the number of Italians remaining within Yugoslav territory as much as possible.

    【新华社延安一日电】巴黎讯：法国关于的里雅斯特与意南边界的新提案，已被苏美英外长接受，作为讨论该问题的基础。法国的提案于二十九日的会上提出，其要点如下：的里雅斯特及其邻近区域，于十年内改作自治区，由四强及意南两国共管。该区域之领土完整，将由联合国安理会予以保证。法外长声称：他希望这个计划能作为新的努力的基础。苏联代表团指出：新计划是不能令人满意的，因为该计划的实现，会违背南斯拉夫人民的民族感情，并且其暂时性质会造成不稳定因素及特别复杂的机构。但苏代表认为这一建议提供了寻求妥协的可能，是可以接受作为解决方案的基础的，苏联代表团保留在详细研究此计划后提出修改案之权。对此新计划要点未加评论的英美代表团，声明他们愿意研究该计划。二十九日的会上，还通过了限制意大利海军的决议，对于意大利海军前途的其他问题，已委托海军专家委员会筹备会议。会议结束时，美国代表提议确定七月二十五日为和会日期，苏代表团坚持以前的决定，即和会应在外长会议前委托之任务（即准备和约草案）完成后举行，但认为会议日期问题，可在数日之内讨论。
    【新华社延安一日电】巴黎讯：南斯拉夫副总理卡德尔六月二十七日就的里雅斯特与意南边界问题，在巴黎发表谈话。卡德尔指出：南斯拉夫不能同意侵吞它的主要城市的里雅斯特，也不能同意它的海口被人侵占，南斯拉夫决不签字或同意任何不能满足它这些正当要求的和平条约。卡德尔说：近来出现了一种的里雅斯特国际化的计划，可是南斯拉夫对这种国际化的方案，也如的里雅斯特归并意大利一样不能接受。卡德尔在结语中指陈：南斯拉夫准备尽其所有的力量，采用一切办法，使的里雅斯特及朱利亚问题尽量获致协议，南国准备担负必要的实际义务，以保证朱利亚的完全自治，给以联邦共和国的地位。南国准备承认的里亚斯特港为自由港，准备接受西部疆界的某些修改，使留在南国版图内的意大利人尽可能减到最少数。
