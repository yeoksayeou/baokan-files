　　Continuous Heavy Rain Causes Mountain Floods
    Nanhe and Renxian Counties' Fields Flooded
    Jinnan Administrative Office Allocates 400,000 Jin of Rice for Relief
    Quzhou Organizes the Masses to Eradicate Locust Nymphs
    [Our newspaper's Weixian dispatch] From May 9th to 11th, continuous heavy rain caused mountain floods, resulting in flooding in Nanhe and Renxian counties. In Nanhe, over 330 *qing* of wheat fields and over 600 *qing* of autumn crops were flooded. In Renxian, over 300 *qing* of wheat and broad beans, and over 340 *qing* of autumn crops were flooded. Our Jinnan Administrative Office has now decided to allocate 400,000 *jin* of rice to relieve the affected masses in the two counties. The Fourth Special District Office, based on the size of the flooded areas and the severity of the disaster in the two counties, has determined to convert the rice into 540,000 *jin* of red sorghum, lending 320,000 *jin* to Nanhe and 220,000 *jin* to Renxian. It also instructed the two counties to organize the masses on a large scale to engage in agricultural and sideline production through grain loans, overcome all difficulties, and embark on self-reliance through production. It is also necessary to educate the masses to make long-term plans and prevent phenomena such as misuse or failure to engage in production. After receiving the instructions, many cadres from the two counties have gone to the disaster-stricken villages to carry out relief work.
    [Our newspaper's Weixian dispatch] Recently, locust nymphs have appeared in the fifth *ting* and Hanzhuang area of the seventh district (disaster area) of Quzhou. They are three *li* long and wide, covering an area of over one hundred *qing*. Some of the grain seedlings have been eaten to death. All the district's political and civilian cadres have been mobilized and dispatched to the countryside to organize the masses. More than ten villages there have now organized a locust eradication command, forming locust eradication brigades, platoons, squads, women's teams, and children's teams. Except for one person left in each household to cook, men, women, old and young, all participated. On the morning of the 17th of this month, more than 2,500 people, each carrying willow branches, brooms, cloth bags, shoe soles, etc., under the hot sun, launched a planned encirclement and annihilation campaign against the locust nymphs. The surrounding tens of *li* were filled with the sound of people shouting and dust flying. After repeated encirclement and suppression, and after three days of assault, all the locust nymphs were eradicated.
