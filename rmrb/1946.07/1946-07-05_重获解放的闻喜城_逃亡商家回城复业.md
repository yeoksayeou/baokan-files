　　The now liberated city of Wenxi is moving towards a new prosperity. When the Eighth Route Army liberated the city, after 190 days of rule by the Yan [Xishan] and puppet [Japanese] troops, it had become a city of disaster and death. The people's food and clothing had long been plundered. The desolate streets, apart from two barber shops catering exclusively to the Yan and puppet troops, held only a few starving refugees. After the Eighth Route Army liberated the city again on the 14th of last month, the democratic government immediately conducted a disaster assessment, distributed 14,000 catties of millet to relieve the refugees, and announced the exemption of city residents from burdens for one year. Merchants and capitalists who had fled the city, upon hearing that the democratic government had entered the city, returned one after another. With the government's help and support, more than twenty large and small businesses have now resumed operations in the city. Small stalls and peddlers are all over the city. People from dozens of miles around flock to the city to attend the market every day, in an endless stream. Currently, the masses in various villages are celebrating their re-liberation everywhere and launching a campaign to support the army.

　　重获解放的闻喜城
    逃亡商家回城复业
    【本报阳城讯】新解放后的闻喜城，现已走向新的繁荣，当八路军解放该城时，这座被阎伪军统治了一百九十天的城市，已变成了一座灾难的死城。人民粮食衣物，早被抢夺净尽，冷落的街头上，除了两家专供阎伪军理发店外，就只有很少饥馑的难民了。上月十四日，八路军再次解放该城后，民主政府立即进行灾情调查，发放小米一万四千斤，救济难民，并布告免除城内居民一年负担。逃亡在外的商人资本家，听到民主政府进驻城内，纷纷返回，他们在政府的帮助扶植下，现城内已复业大小商号廿余家，小摊挑贩遍布全城，附近数十里的群众，每日进城赶集，络绎于途，现各村群众，正到处庆祝重获解放，开展劳军运动。
