　　[This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Handan] As people from all walks of life in Handan solemnly and warmly commemorate the "July 7th Incident," the news that Captain Liu Shanben led a bomber plane in an anti-civil war uprising has filled the entire city with cheers and applause, with people spreading the news to each other. Soon, several blackboards were moved from the Education Hall to the main intersections of Heping Road and Hanshan Road, and were immediately surrounded by people. Liu Renhou, the butcher shop owner, stroked his gray beard and said to everyone with a beaming face: "This is a heavy slap in the face to Chiang Kai-shek. If he continues to fight the civil war, there will be more of this kind of thing." Farmer Zhang Laokun believed that this was "because the people of the whole country know that the Communist Party is good," otherwise, "Why would he fly to Yan'an?" He also said: "Mr. Liu truly deserves to be called a patriotic man." The Border Area Council, labor, peasant, youth, and women's organizations all sent special telegrams to congratulate Captain Liu. The telegram from the Provisional Council stated: "Your Excellency's leading of fellow patriots in an anti-civil war uprising is a righteous act that is admired by all. This is a major blow to the warmongers of the Kuomintang. The people of the whole country are behind you." The telegram concluded with a call: "Patriotic air force soldiers, fly, strive to fly, fly to Yan'an, and learn from the just actions of Mr. Liu Shanben and others to withdraw from the civil war."
    [Another Telegram] The Taihang, Taiyue, Jinnan, and Jiluyu Administrative Offices, as well as the councils, labor, peasant, youth, women's organizations, and other institutions in this area, were delighted to learn that Captain Liu Shanben, squadron leader of the 35th Squadron of the Central Aviation 8th Group, and others had flown one aircraft out of the civil war and arrived in Yan'an on the 26th of last month. They sent a special telegram to express their condolences. The telegram stated: "We deeply admire your glorious action of flying to Yan'an and joining the people's democratic camp for the sake of the country and the people."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th] Chairman Lin Boqu, Vice Chairmen Li Dingming and Liu Jingfan of the Border Region Government, recently sent letters to Captain Liu Shanben and ten air force friends on behalf of the 1.6 million people of the Border Region, expressing their congratulations and condolences. The letter stated: "Your righteous act of withdrawing from the civil war and flying to Yan'an is a serious blow to the Kuomintang authorities' crime of violating the people's will and relying on foreign aid to carry out civil war and massacre compatriots. It is of great help to the promotion of China's independence, peace, and democracy. The people of the Border Region have always adhered to peace. We hereby extend our warm welcome to you on behalf of the 1.6 million people of the entire Border Region and extend our congratulations. The people of the Border Region will work with you to strive for the complete realization of China's independence, peace, and democracy."

　　刘善本上尉等驾机退出内战
    各地纷纷电贺义举
    【本报邯郸电】邯郸各界人民正严肃而热烈的纪念“七七”之际听到刘善本上尉率领轰炸机反内战起义的消息，全城欢呼鼓掌，奔走相告，不久，几块黑板报从教育馆中抬到和平路、邯山路的要道口上，马上被人们包围起来。肉铺老板刘仁厚捻着他那花白的胡子，眉飞色舞的对大家说：“这件事对蒋介石是个重重的嘴巴，他再打内战，这种事还会更多的。”农民张老琨认为这是“因为全国人民都知道共产党好”，否则“他为什么飞到延安去呢？”他又说：“刘先生真不愧为一个爱国男儿”。边参会，工农青妇各群众团体均以专电庆贺刘上尉，临参会电文上说：“阁下率领诸志士举行反内战起义，大义所在，薄海同钦，这是向国民党好战分子的一大打击，全国人民，都在作你们的后盾。”该电最后号召：“爱国的空军战士们，飞啊，努力飞，飞到延安来，学习刘善本等先生退出内战的正义行动。”
    【又电】此间太行、太岳、冀南、冀鲁豫各行署，各参议会及工农青妇等机关团体，欣闻中央航空第八大队三十五中队机长刘善本上尉等自驾飞机一架退出内战，于上月二十六日飞抵延安，特电表示慰问。该电略称：“你们飞抵延安，参加人民民主阵营这种为国为民的光荣行动，我们深表钦佩。”
    【新华社延安八日电】边区政府林伯渠主席、李鼎铭、刘景范副主席，顷代表边区一百六十万人民，致函刘善本上尉，及十位空军朋友，表示祝贺与慰勉。该函称：“你们退出内战，驾机飞延的义举，对国民党当局违背人民公意，依仗外国援助进行内战屠杀同胞的罪行，是一个严重的打击。对于中国独立和平民主事业的推进，有很大的帮助。边区人民一向坚持和平。我们谨代表全边区一百六十万人民热忱欢迎你们，并致祝贺之意。边区人民将和你们一起，为争取中国的独立和平民主的完全实现而奋斗到底”。
