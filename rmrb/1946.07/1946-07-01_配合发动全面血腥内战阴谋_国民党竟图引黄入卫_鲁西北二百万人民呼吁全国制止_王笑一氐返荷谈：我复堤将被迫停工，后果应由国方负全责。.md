　　In Conspiracy with the Plot to Launch a Full-Scale Bloody Civil War
    The Kuomintang Actually Plans to Divert the Yellow River into the Wei River
    Two Million People in Northwestern Shandong Call on the Nation to Stop It
    Wang Xiaoyi Returns to Holland and States: Our Dyke Restoration Will Be Forced to Stop, and the Consequences Should Be Borne Entirely by the Chinese Side.
    [Our newspaper, Linqing] The Kuomintang authorities are attempting to tear up the Nanjing Yellow River Management Agreement once again, not only plotting to flood seven million people in the old course of the Yellow River in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region, but also harboring more sinister intentions, planning to "divert the Yellow River into the Wei River" and drown two million people in northwestern Shandong, to coordinate with their impending full-scale bloody civil war. All members of the Border Area Consultative Assemblies and two million people from eight counties along the Wei and Yun Rivers in northwestern Shandong, including Linqing, Guanxian, and Guantao, have issued a nationwide telegram, urgently calling on everyone to jointly stop this vicious plot by the Kuomintang authorities and to supervise them in immediately and faithfully implementing the Nanjing Agreement. The original telegram stated in brief: "Recently, the Wei River has been constantly breaching its banks. Just as 150,000 people in our area are actively engaged in dyke construction, sluice gate repair, and canal dredging to prevent floods, we suddenly heard that the Kuomintang authorities are planning to tear up the Nanjing Agreement and plotting to 'divert the Yellow River into the Wei River.' Upon hearing this terrible news, everyone is rushing around to inform each other. The Yellow River is turbulent and swift, and even at its narrowest points, it is no less than three miles wide, while the Wei River is silted up and shallow, and at its widest point, it is only a dozen or so yards wide. Once the 'Yellow River is diverted into the Wei River,' the floodwaters will be overwhelming, and the lives and property of the peaceful people in our eight counties in northwestern Shandong will inevitably be completely submerged. Regarding this criminal plot by the Kuomintang authorities, our two million people in the entire region will not hesitate to make any sacrifices and will resolutely oppose it!"
    [Our newspaper, Handan, 25th] Wang Xiaoyi, representative of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Committee, went to Nanjing to urge the Kuomintang authorities to implement the Nanjing Agreement. However, the Water Resources Commission and the Executive Headquarters deliberately delayed and dealt with the matter with various excuses such as "procedures," "systems," "preparations," and "investigations," resulting in no results from the negotiations. Wang returned to Holland on the 20th. The person in charge of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Committee declared regarding this absurd behavior of the Kuomintang: "The Kuomintang authorities have no sincerity in implementing the Nanjing Agreement. On the one hand, they disregard our 230,000 dyke restoration workers and 360,000 residents along the river, delay supplies, and fail to issue relocation and relief funds. On the other hand, they do not repair the dykes above Changyuan and near Jinan, but instead intensify the closure project, preparing to dump stones, dig diversion canals, and dismantle the new Bian Road in early July to release water. If this absurd behavior is not immediately corrected, the dyke restoration project in the liberated areas will inevitably be forced to stop halfway and will cease operations by the end of this month, making it impossible to complete this year's river management project according to the planned schedule, and the consequences should be borne by the Kuomintang authorities.

　　配合发动全面血腥内战阴谋
    国民党竟图引黄入卫
    鲁西北二百万人民呼吁全国制止
    王笑一氐返荷谈：我复堤将被迫停工，后果应由国方负全责。
    【本报临清讯】国民党当局企图再次撕毁南京治黄协议，不仅阴谋淹害冀鲁豫沿黄河故道的七百万人民，竟更包藏祸心，策划“引黄入卫”，淹毙鲁西北二百万人民，以配合其行将发动之全面血腥内战。鲁西北卫、运两河沿岸临清、冠县、馆陶等八县全体边参会参议员暨二百万人民，顷特为此通电全国，紧急呼吁共起制止国民党当局此种恶毒阴谋，并监督其立即忠实执行南京协议。原电略称：“近来卫河已不断决口，正当我区十五万群众，积极从事于筑堤修闸，开渠裁湾等治河工程、防止水灾之际，突闻国民党当局又图撕毁南京协议，策划“引黄入卫”，惊闻凶耗，莫不惶然奔走相告。查黄河汹涌湍急，河身窄处亦不下三里，而卫河河身淤浅，最宽处不过十余丈，一旦“引黄入卫”，则大水滔滔，我鲁西北八县和平人民之生命财产，势必尽被淹没。对于国民党当局此种罪恶阴谋，我全区二百万人民将不惜任何牺牲，誓死反对！”
    【本报邯郸二十五日电】冀鲁豫黄委会代表王笑一氏，前赴京督促国民党当局执行南京协议，因水委会、行总方面以“手续”、“制度”、“筹备”、“调查”等种种借口，故意拖延应付，致商谈未获任何结果，王氏已于二十日返荷。冀鲁豫黄委会负责人顷对国民党此种悖谬行为宣称：“国民党当局对执行南京协议毫无诚意，一面置我二十三万复堤工人及三十六万河身居民于不顾，拖延供给，不发迁移救济费，一面又不修复长垣以上及济南附近之堤岸，反而加紧堵口工程，准备七月初抛石、挖引河、拆除新汴路，进行放水。此种悖谬行为如不立即改正，则解放区复堤工程，势必被迫中途而废，于本月底停工，将使今年治河工程不能按预定计划完成，其后果应由国民党当局负责。
