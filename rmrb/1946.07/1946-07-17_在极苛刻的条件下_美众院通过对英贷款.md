　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. Reports indicate that the US House of Representatives, under harsh conditions, passed the loan to Britain bill by a vote of 219 to 155. According to the US loan to Britain, repayments will be made in equal installments over 50 years starting in 1951, with an interest rate of 2%, but no interest is required for the first five years. The first repayment of principal and interest will be on December 31, 1951. Repayment will depend on the amount Britain can provide at that time. According to the loan terms, Britain will: Firstly, before 1951, not grant any country within the British Empire loans with conditions more favorable to Britain than the US loan; Secondly, participate in the formulation of a charter to eliminate tariff preferences (i.e., Imperial Preference); Thirdly, not use any US loan to repay its frozen sterling debts; Fourthly, abolish its "dollar pool" within one year. According to this "dollar pool" method, all dollar income is locked within the sterling area; after this, any country within the sterling area—such as India, South Africa, Egypt, or Australia—will be able to freely use its dollar income. The passage of this bill comes exactly seven months and seven days after the Anglo-American Financial Agreement was signed last December, at which time it was hoped that Congressional action on the measure would be concluded within weeks. However, it was not until January 30th that President Truman submitted the agreement to Congress. Further delay was caused by the US Senate, Bank and Loan Committee, whose inquiry, which began on March 5th, lasted 31 days, with a vote of 14 to 5 deciding in favor of the loan. The Senate then held a debate on April 15th, characterized by unproductive proposed speeches, which at one point threatened to invalidate the measure, but the 26-day loan debate has now been passed by a vote of 46 to 34.

　　在极苛刻的条件下
    美众院通过对英贷款
    【新华社延安十四日电】各方报导：美众院在苛刻条件下，以二一九票对一五五票通过对英贷款案。按美国对英贷款将自一九五一年起，于五十年内均摊还清，利率为百分之二，但头五年不要利息。本利之第一次偿还，将为一九五一年十二月三十一日。偿还将决定于英国届时所能给出之数目。根据贷款条件，英国将：第一、在一九五一年以前，不以较美国贷款更利于英方的条件，给予英帝国内任何国家以贷款；第二、参加制定宪章，以取消关税优先权（即帝国优先权）；第三、不使任何美国贷款以偿付其被冻结的金镑债务；第四、一年内取消它的“美元贮蓄”。根据此“美元贮蓄”办法，所有美元收入，均被封锁于金镑区域之内；在此之后，任何金镑区内之国家——如印度、南菲、埃及或澳洲，均将能任意使用其美元收入。该案之通过，恰在英美财政协议于去年十二月签字之后七个月又七日，当时曾希望国会对该措施的行动，数周间即可结束，可是直到一月三十日，杜鲁门总统才将该协定交给国会。再次延搁是美参院、银行与贷款委员会，三月五日开始之询问，历时三十一天，以十四票对五票决定赞成借款。参院继于四月十五日举行辩论，其特征是发生无益于事的提议演说，一时曾有使该措施失效之虞，但是二十六天的借款辩论，现以四十六票对三十四票予以通过。
