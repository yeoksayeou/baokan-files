　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 28th— Datong employees of the Pingsui Railway, unable to bear the oppression of Yan's puppet troops, are bringing their families back to the liberated areas. Forty-nine workers originally from Tangshan, Wuqing, and other places, carried the old and the young along the road to the city to take a train back home. After learning about this, the workers of the Pingsui Railway General Administration in Zhangjiakou immediately raised tens of thousands of yuan, purchased goods, and sent representatives to express their sympathy. The workers from both places had a cordial conversation. Han Xinghui, a Datong train driver, said sadly: "Since Yan Xishan occupied Datong, railway workers have only received over 58,000 yuan in relief funds in the past six months. Currently, prices in Datong are exorbitant; 1,000 yuan can only buy one jin and four taels of millet, and even bad sorghum flour can only buy three jin. Many workers are eating tree leaves to survive. This time, in order to raise money for the escape, I sold my own six-year-old son, and pitifully, he only sold for 60,000 legal tender." Another machine worker said: "The people of Datong have absolutely no freedom of speech or action. Entering and leaving the city is still subjected to the arrogance of that old batch of traitorous puppet troops. Railway workers have to do hard labor for Yan Xishan even during their off-duty hours." When the workers in the liberated areas described their own lives of abundance after liberation, the Datong workers said with envy: "The liberated areas are the workers' own home." After the meeting, the Pingsui Railway Bureau gave each Datong refugee worker a free train ticket and instructed stations along the way to take good care of them.

　　大同平绥员工不堪阎伪压榨
    扶老携幼纷纷归来
    【新华社张家口二十八日电】平绥路大同员工，不堪阎伪军压榨，纷纷携带家属逃返解放区。原籍唐山、武清等工友四十九人，扶老携幼路经本市至车站搭车返乡。张家口平绥铁路总管理局各厂工人得悉后，立即募集数万元，购买物品选派代表前往慰问。两地工友亲切交谈，大同火车司机韩兴会惨痛的说：“自从阎锡山进占大同，半年来只给铁路工人发了五万八千多元接济费，目前大同物价昂贵，一千块钱只能买一斤四两小米，坏高粱面亦只能买三斤，很多工人都以树叶糊口，我这次为了筹集逃用路费，卖了六岁的亲生男孩子，可怜只卖得六万法币”。另一个机器工人说：“大同老百姓言语行动根本没有自由，出入城还要受旧日那批汉奸伪军的气，铁道工人休班时，还得替阎锡山做苦工”。当解放区工人介绍自己翻身后丰衣足食生活时，大同工友们羡慕的说：“解放区是工人们自己的家”。会后平绥路局赠与大同逃难工友每人免费乘车证一张，并饬沿路各站妥为照料。
