　　The Democratic Allied Army in the Summer Harvest
　　　　Fu En
　　During the years the Democratic Allied Army resided in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, they also helped the villagers with the wheat harvest during the hot summer days when the wheat ears ripened. However, it was very different from helping the people in the Liberated Areas harvest wheat this year. As one soldier of the regiment put it, “Before, in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, we also helped the people harvest wheat, but that was completely forced. We didn’t want to do it ourselves, and the squad leader would be watching from behind. If we didn’t harvest, we would get beaten. So the soldiers would just do a sloppy job and only think about asking the people for good food and drinks, and often deliberately damage the people's furniture.” Regiment Commander Li also said, “Before, when we were stationed in Nangou, Shanzhou, Henan, to help the people harvest wheat, the soldiers would harvest in front, and the landlords and wealthy people would watch from behind in their gowns, smoking cigarettes. Who would want to do it in that situation?” Indeed, this is a common feeling shared by most officers and soldiers today.

　　Today, the situation of the troops is different from what it used to be. In the words of the soldiers, “Commander-in-Chief Gao has led us onto the road of democracy.” In this democratic melting pot, both officers and soldiers have been tempered and are continuously being trained. Compared to this spring, it is already different. I remember that when the troops helped the people with spring plowing at that time, many comrades still retained the remnants of past bad habits. Some deliberately found fault with the people while helping, and some said, “The army helps the people, and the people should also help the army.” So after helping, they would ask the people for a lot of favors, or intentionally damage the people's things, and even openly insult the people. As a result, the troops were not sincerely helping, and the people were not happy to be helped. Therefore, the helping effect at that time was not great.

　　In the past few months, after the development of the democratic movement within the troops, the education of army-people relations, and the influence of many specific and vivid facts in the external mass movement and local work on the troops, the broad masses of soldiers have realized, “Why are we soldiers?” and “Who are we working for as soldiers?” The struggle for the poor to turn over is no longer opposed or watched from the sidelines, but sympathized with and participated in. The sentry duty of the militia children's corps is no longer discriminated against, but helped. As for helping the people harvest wheat this time, it is even more sincere and voluntary. Many soldiers said, "Now we are the people's army, and it is our responsibility to help the people harvest wheat. Besides, what we eat and drink are all supplied by the people. Today we eat well and dress well, and we get what we are supposed to get when it is issued. To be honest, which one is not better than in the Kuomintang? In addition, the people are so good to us usually, not to mention helping to harvest some wheat, even if we help with something else that is more laborious, we are willing to do it. Anyway, working hard in the Liberated Areas today is much better than suffering that kind of foreign crime in the Kuomintang-controlled areas." Some soldiers also said, "We are all oppressed people, and we should help the families of martyrs and the poor." These truthful words are exactly the soldiers' understanding today, just as one soldier said, "In the past, the ruling class covered our faces with a black cloth, and today we finally removed it."

　　When the wheat ears were only half yellow, the First Division stopped regular classes and specifically carried out a summer harvest mobilization and education. The Second Division was then engaged in the "Support the Government and Cherish the People" movement, and immediately put forward the slogan, "Doing a good job in helping the masses with the wheat harvest is truly doing a good job in supporting the government and cherishing the people." Second Army Commander Qiao had already held meetings with local cadres, and based on the review of the shortcomings in the spring plowing, made improved arrangements. The teaching schedule of the General Headquarters Cadre Training Corps had already set aside time to help the masses with the wheat harvest... Because of this, when Commander-in-Chief Gao's call to "stop all exercises and help the masses with the wheat harvest" was issued, a hot wave was quickly created in every corner of the troops.

　　Around the Dragon Boat Festival, under this hot sun, soldiers bending over were everywhere in the suburbs and fields. Here, three squads are competing: "See who harvests faster, see who harvests better." There, five groups are still singing: "Everyone work hard, let's harvest together." Even more soldiers are arguing over a shared sickle, and no one wants to rest for a while...

　　In Baifu, Commander Fan held back seven orderlies and was still harvesting even though his hands were blistered; in Baijian, Commander Qiao was together with two orderlies, and did not rest even though his back was aching; in Shishimen, Division Commander Chen had to go to harvest every day; in Zhaodian Town, Division Commander Tian would come to the field whenever he had free time; Yan, the Education Director of the Cadre Training Corps, did not take a break even though he was sick; Zhou, the Education Director, led a group of young students from the Jianxiao School, and was active in the villages near Zilu; Deputy Commander Liao led the staff of the General Headquarters to shuttle back and forth between the wheat ridges outside Yicheng; Commander-in-Chief Gao, although very busy, still took the time to walk on the wheat fields of Yicheng. Most of the officers of the entire army, regardless of their positions or ranks, were with the soldiers, both leading and supervising, and also doing the work themselves; even the female comrades and some family members working in various departments also rolled up their sleeves and went to the fields.

　　The soldiers were even more energetic, everyone striving to be the first, everyone wanting to harvest more. They forgot that the scorching sun was shining on their heads, they ignored the sweat on their faces, they did not want to take a holiday on the Dragon Boat Festival, and they did not rest during the afternoon nap. Soldier Zheng Yunchang was disabled, and four of his left hand's fingers were gone. The company commander advised him to stay at home and do some light work. He said, "Although I can't harvest, I can still carry and lift." As a result, he had to carry twenty-five bundles every day. On June 6th, he carried fifteen bundles in half a day. Deputy squad leader Sun Shuxun was sick, and the platoon leader asked him to stay at home to rest. He was very unhappy and insisted on going. As a result, he led all the soldiers in the class very actively. A fifteen-year-old comrade, Li Guobang, had sores on his legs, but he ignored the pain and harvested quickly and cleanly. He also said to others, "The sores don't hurt anymore!" The groom Lu Guangsi was originally asked to take care of the livestock at home, but when he saw that others were harvesting very vigorously, he fed the livestock early the next morning and automatically joined the wheat harvesting team. Even the four comrades from the cooperative of the Second Battalion of the Third Regiment stopped their business and joined the wheat harvesting camp. The cooks and orderlies of the Third Regiment Headquarters all went out to harvest wheat, and the wife of Deputy Regiment Commander Ma personally went to the kitchen to cook for everyone; almost everyone was swept into the wave of wheat harvesting. Some units automatically launched competitions, established a judging committee, and also invited villagers to participate; some departments, in order to examine the harvesting situation, organized a civil affairs investigation team, solicited opinions from the masses every night, and corrected everyone's shortcomings in wheat harvesting at any time; many comrades, in addition to participating in the collective wheat harvesting team, also took the time to help the landlord harvest separately, with almost no time to rest; many units, after harvesting the wheat fields in their own village, went to other villages for expeditions. The people were so happy that they couldn't close their mouths.

　　The people of Xiyangyuan said, "In previous years, the wheat was still in the ground at this time. This year, we have already eaten white flour buns. Whose credit is this?" Without a doubt, everyone will unanimously answer, "It is the credit of the troops."

　　The people of Zhao Village (this village is not stationed with troops) said, "In the past, when harvesting wheat, no matter how much money you spent, you couldn't hire anyone, and you were very anxious; this year, without spending money, the troops automatically came to the door, how happy! What else is there to say?"

　　The people prepared meals at home, planning to let the comrades come back and eat something, but as soon as the troops finished harvesting, they gathered and left. They couldn't even find a shadow. There was no way, so the people sent the prepared steamed buns and dumplings to the fields for the comrades to eat, but everyone politely declined. The people shouted anxiously, "If you don't eat even a little bit, how can we farmers get over it?" The comrades listened and explained, "Good folks, it's nothing, isn't eating back there still the people supplying us?"

　　Even so, the people tried everything they could to express their gratitude to the troops.

　　Wu Wanzhang, a resident of Luanyan Village, submitted a letter to the army newspaper praising the machine gun company of the Second Battalion of the First Regiment: "...The people welcome and respect." Hao Xinmin, a teacher at Deyi Village Elementary School, wrote a letter to the army officers praising the Third Battalion of the Special Service Regiment of the stationed army: "...They are models of wheat harvesting."

　　The people of various villages sent condolences to the troops, cigarettes, dried vegetables, vermicelli, pork... batch after batch, while the troops either declined on the spot or returned them the next day; Yang Shanglian, the village chief of Mao Village, personally carried the condolences of the entire village to the First Battalion of the Tenth Regiment of the stationed army, which was ten miles away, and insisted that the troops keep them for use. They had no choice but to temporarily accept them, but the next day they wrote a thank-you letter and sent someone to return them.

　　The people of Zhao Village felt that the help from the troops was so unforgettable that they wanted to write a play for the troops to express their sincere feelings.

　　The people of Yangyuan Village held a forum with the Fourth Regiment to pour out their true feelings. A deaf old woman led a blind old woman to participate. At the meeting, the deaf old woman could not hear what everyone was saying, and the blind old woman would tell her what she heard at the meeting: "In the future, we must help the troops solve difficulties in all aspects." This was the guarantee that everyone made to the Fourth Regiment at the meeting.

　　The people of more than forty villages in the Fourth District of Wu'an held a 5,000-6,000-person support-the-army meeting in Zhaodian, and presented seven support-the-army banners to the stationed army in the district, as well as condolences worth 400,000 yuan. District Chief Li and Political Commissar Li spoke on behalf of all the people, saying what they wanted to say: "...The troops have been of great help to our people. In just seven days of this wheat harvest, they have harvested 33,239 mu of land for our people, saving more than 1,500 workdays, directly reducing the burden on the people... Today, the Democratic Allied Army under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Gao has become the army of our people..."

　　Indeed, all the people in the stationed areas, from their personal experiences before and after, felt that today's Democratic Allied Army has made great progress compared to the past.

　　Whenever they cool off in the evening, the people often praise the troops. "The Democratic Allied Army has become ours!"

　　民主建国军在夏收中
    辅恩
    民主建国军在国民党统治区住的几年中，每当夏日炎炎麦穗黄熟的时候，也曾帮助老乡们收过麦，可是要和今年在解放区帮助老百姓割麦子相比起来，那就大不同了，一团战士说得很好：“以前在国民党统治区也帮助老百姓割麦子，但那完全是被迫的，自己不愿干，班长在后边监视着，不割就挨揍，所以当兵的只得了草应付一下，并且光想问老百姓要好吃好喝的，还常常故意弄坏老百姓的家具。”李团长也这样说：“以前在河南陕州南沟驻防时给老百姓割麦子，当兵的在前边割，地主老财穿着大褂吸着纸烟在后面看，这种情形当兵的谁还愿意干呢？”的确，这是今天大部分官长和士兵共同具有的一种感觉。
    今天部队的情况，已和过去两样了，用士兵的话来说：“总司令把我们带上了民主的大道。”在这民主的熔炉中，不管官长或士兵，都已受到了陶冶，并在继续不断地锻炼着。就拿现在和今春来比，也是不同的，记得那时部队帮助老百姓春耕，不少同志还保留有过去的恶习残余，有的故意在帮助中找老百姓的岔子，有的说：“军队帮助老百姓，老百姓也应该帮助军队”于是在帮助之后就向老百姓大量要差，或有意损坏老百姓的东西，还有公开辱骂老百姓的，这样部队既不是真诚的帮助，老百姓也就不乐意让帮助了，所以那时的帮助作用是不大的。
    几个月来，部队内部经过了民主运动的开展，军民关系的教育，再加上外部群众运动和地方工作中许多具体生动事实所给予部队的影响，已经使广大的士兵群众认识到：“我们为什么要当兵？”以及：“我们当兵是给谁做事情的？”对于穷人翻身所进行的斗争，不再是反对或旁观，而是同情与参加，对于民兵儿童团的站岗放哨，不再是歧视，而是帮助，至于对这次帮助老百姓割麦，那就更是出于真心自愿的了，许多战士都这样说：“现在我们是人民的军队，帮助老百姓割麦子是我们应有的责任。再说，我们吃的喝的都是老百姓供给，今天我们吃得饱穿得好，到发什么的时候给发什么，凭良心说，那一宗不比国民党那里强呢？另外老百姓平时对咱们又那样好，不要说帮助割点麦子，就是再帮助干点别的，那怕比这更费力气，也是甘心愿意的，反正今天在解放区再卖力气也比在国民党统治区受那种洋罪强得多。”还有的士兵说：“我们都是受压迫的人，应该帮助抗属和穷人。”这些真实的话句，正是士兵今天的认识，正如一个士兵所说：“过去统治阶级把我们脸上朦了一块黑布，今天才算把它给揭掉了。”
    还在麦穗半黄的时候，一师就停止了正课，专门进行了一次麦收的动员和教育，二师那时正在搞拥政爱民运动，随即提出：“把帮助群众麦收搞好就是真正做到了拥政爱民”的口号，二军乔军长早已和地方干部开会，根据检讨春耕中的缺点，作了改进性的布置，总部干训团的授课日程中，早已留出了帮助群众麦收的时间……正因为这样，所以当高总司令“停止一切操课，帮助群众麦收”的号召发出时，部队所有每个角落里，很快就造成了热潮。
    端阳节前后，这炎热的日光下，四郊遍野到处都是弯着腰的军人，这里三个班在比赛：“看谁割的快，看谁割的好。”那里五个组还唱歌：“大家都努力，一齐动手割。”更有士兵正在争争一把共用的镰刀，谁都不愿意多休息一会……
    在柏府，范军长滞了七个传令兵，手磨出泡了还在割；在白涧，乔军长和两个传令兵在一起，腰弯疼了还不休息；在史石门，陈师长每天都要去割；在赵店镇，田师长一有空就来下地；干训团阎教育长，虽然有病也不稍歇；周教育长带领建校一群青年学生，活跃在紫罗左近的各村庄；廖副总司令领导总部各处工作人员，往返于邑城四外的麦垅中；高总司令虽然很忙，还抽空子走上了邑城的麦地。全军多数官佐，都是不分职务，不论等级，和士兵在一起，一面领导督促，一面动手去割；就连各部门工作的女同志和一部分家属也都卷袖上地了。
    士兵是更加卖力，人人争先恐后，个个都想多割，他们忘掉了头顶的烈日在晒，他们不顾满脸的汗流，端午节不要放假，午睡时不去休息。战士郑云昌是个残废，左手五指掉了四个，连长劝他留在家里做点轻活，他说；“我虽不能割，但还能担能扛，”结果每天要扛二十五捆，六月六号那天，半天就扛了十五捆，副班长孙树勋有病，排长让他留在家里休息，他很不高兴，非去不可，结果领导全班战士非常积极，一个十五岁的同志李国邦腿上有疮，也不顾疼痛，割得又快又净，他还对别人说；“疮也不疼了！”马夫路光思本来让他在家里管牲口，可是当他看到别人割得很起劲，第二天早早把牲口喂好，自动参加了割麦组，甚至三团二营合作社的四个同志，也停止了营业，参加到割麦阵营里，三团团部的伙马夫传令兵全部出去割麦，马副团长的太太亲自下伙房替大家做饭吃；差不多每个人都卷到了割麦的浪潮中，有的单位自动发起竞赛，成立了评判委员会，还请老乡参加；有的部分为了考查收割的情形，组织了民运调查组，每晚向群众征求意见，随时纠正每个人在割麦中的缺点；不少同志除参加集体的割麦组外，又抽暇单独帮助房东去割，几乎没有休息的时间；许多单位在割完本村麦田之后，又到外村去远征。老百姓一个个高兴得合不拢嘴巴。
    西阳苑的老百姓说：“往年这时候，麦子还都在地里，今年这时候，已经吃上白面馍馍了，这是谁的功劳呢？”毫无疑议的，所有的人们都会一致的回答；“是部队的功劳。”
    赵村（这村未驻部队）的老百姓说：“过去割麦子的时候，花钱多少雇不到人，干着急；今年不花钱，队伍自动找到门上来，多痛快！这还有啥话说？”
    老百姓在家里预备好饭菜，打算让同志们回来吃点子，可是部队一经割完就集合走了。连人影也摸不到，没办法，老百姓就把做好的馍馍粽子送到地里，让同志们吃，大家却以婉言谢绝了，老百姓急得叫喊：“连一点也不吃，叫我们庄稼人怎能过意得去呢？”同志们听着解释着：“好老乡，没有什么，回去吃还不是老百姓供给我们的？”
    虽然这样，老百姓还是想尽一切办法来表达他们对部队的感激。
    栾岩村居民武万章给部队报纸投稿表扬一团二营机枪连：“……人民欢迎又敬仰，”得义村小学教员郝新民给部队长官写信称赞驻军特务团第三营：“……他们割麦够模范。”
    各村老百姓纷纷慰劳部队，纸烟，干菜，粉条，猪肉……一批又一批，而部队则有的当面谢绝，有的改日退还；毛村村长杨尚廉亲自携带全村的慰劳品送到相距十里的驻军十团第一营，坚持要部队留下用，不得已只好暂时收下，但第二天写封道谢信又派人送还。
    赵村的老百姓，感到部队帮助实在放不下心，要给部队写台戏唱唱，表示他们赤诚的心意。
    阳苑村的老百姓，和四团在一起开座谈会，倾吐他们的真心话，一个聋老婆给一个瞎老婆带路去参加，在会上聋老婆听不到大家说的是什么，回头瞎老婆再把会上听到的情形告诉她：“今后要从各方面帮助部队解决困难。”这是大家在会上对四团提出的保证。
    武安四区四十几个村子的老百姓，在赵店开了一个五六千人的拥军大会，当场拥护该区驻军锦旗七面，还有价值四十万元的慰劳品，李区长、李政委员代表全体老百姓说出他们要说的话：“……部队对咱们老百姓的帮助是很大的，仅这次麦收七天之内就替咱老百姓割了三万三千二百三十九亩地，即节省了一千五百个以上的工，直接减轻了老百姓的负担……今天高总司令领导下的民主建国军，已经成了咱老百姓的队伍了……”
    的确，所有驻地的老百姓，从他们前后切身的体验中，感觉今天的民主建国军，已经是比过去有了很大的进步。
    每当傍晚乘凉的时候，老百姓常常称赞着部队。“民主建国军成了咱们的了！”
                                                   二十五日
