　　The Emancipation of the Masses in Ma City Street
　　Wu Xiang
　　Ma City Street in the South Gate of Xingtai has 520 households with over 2,000 people, most of whom are vendors, tenants, rickshaw pullers, iron workers, and fur workers. For many years, they struggled for survival under layers of oppression and exploitation. Now, they have awakened, united, and become the masters of Ma City Street. Their heroic struggle for emancipation provides valuable experience for mobilizing urban masses.

　　I. Discovering Problems, Overcoming Difficulties.

　　In March, the district sent people to delve into the mass movement in Ma City Street. Prior to this, a struggle against the traitor Meng Yunda had been conducted, but participation was not widespread, and the masses were not truly mobilized.

　　Once, Street Chief Wang Wanxiang convened a meeting of the masses, which lasted from 3:00 PM to 1:00 AM, with him doing all the talking. He didn't feel that the lack of mass participation was a failure; instead, he was proud of his ability to talk. After the meeting, he boasted to the district comrades: "No need to arrange, we four can handle the struggle!"

　　Wang Wanxiang's family was Hui Muslim; his grandfather and father were both Imams and had a bad habit of riding roughshod over the masses. But the problem wasn't just Wang Wanxiang. Other cadres and activists of good background also lacked a mass perspective and democratic style because they hadn't received further education after the movement. These people had played a role in past struggles, but now, as the movement deepened, they could no longer be the backbone, and some even became obstacles.

　　How should these cadres and activists be treated? Should they be pushed aside? Or should they be helped and reformed? The leadership adopted the latter approach, personally visiting the masses and using what they learned to educate the cadres and activists.

　　A few days later, Wang Baoping, Wang Zhizhong, Chen Wenlin, Hao Suozi, and others were discovered among the masses. They complained about many hardships: forced labor, levies, extortion... and pointed out: the masses don't complain because most of those who suffer are outsiders, afraid of fighting the local bigwigs. They believed that "blows endured cannot be taken back" and "money spent cannot be recovered." They considered past losses settled, fearing a "change of regime" and that the Eighth Route Army wouldn't stay long.

　　These people were convened together with the original cadres and activists, making everyone realize that the masses have many grievances but are afraid to speak out because of concerns. Everyone was mobilized to conduct individual visits, to "connect." The new activists usually didn't directly ask people about their suffering when they did "connect." They first expressed their own suffering to enlighten others. The old activists were mostly not like this: "Do you have grievances?" "Yes!" "Good! You must speak up at the meeting!"

　　Every night, reports were checked: How many people were "connected"? How were they connected? From discussing the method of connecting – "Driving the sheep with a whip, or standing among the masses?" – everyone was guided to recognize that serving the masses makes a good cadre, and ideological reflections were launched. The error of individual activists being unwilling to share the fruits of struggle with the masses and accepting gifts from bad people was criticized. Under such education, Lu Xiushan, Xu Huimin, Tian Yixiang, and others among the original cadres and activists continued to be the most beloved leaders of the masses.

　　With the cadre problem resolved and the difficulties overcome, the situation opened up.

　　II. Unfettered Mobilization, United Struggle.

　　In three days, the number of activists increased from more than twenty to more than one hundred. The movement spread to every corner, with grievances and connections happening everywhere. The leadership was not confined to a few fixed activists. As long as someone fearlessly voiced grievances and led the masses to rise up, they would be united, educated, and then let them unite and educate others.

　　The masses truly rose up. Here, the characteristics of urban poor, different from the rural areas, can be seen: there is very little connection between them. Often, neighbors next door, even in the same courtyard, do not know each other's names. Each has their own different occupations and lives. They all want to voice grievances, but the content, nature, and target of each person's grievance are different.

　　The leadership didn't limit grievances to a specific issue, but based on the actual situation, proposed: "Whatever grievances there are, voice them!"

　　The most frequent was the issue of forced labor: more than one-third of the people on the street were exempt from labor. Moreover, there was embezzlement and self-enrichment. These people were the families and relatives and cronies of the town chief, street chief, bailiff, head of the jia (a group of ten households), the clerk of the commune, and the puppet military and government personnel. The burden of all the forced labor fell on less than two-thirds of the poorest masses. Old Han Da Jiuxu pasted together the slips from the commune demanding his labor, which was thicker than five stacked sesame cakes. The blood and tears within were countless and endless.

　　Next were levies and various extortions. Many people lost their only tattered quilts because they couldn't afford cotton; they had their doors and windows and chests smashed because they couldn't afford copper, leaving even the thin copper sheets. Luo Erni's husband, a wool worker, died of illness from being beaten for forced labor and getting angry. She was left with two little girls under the age of seven with no means of survival, but forced labor still had to be performed. If there was no one, money had to be paid, one hundred and twenty yuan for each instance. After selling all the last of her broken furniture, she had to take her children to the Western Hills to get stones to make stone carvings to sell, getting up before dawn and working until dark. At noon, she would tighten her belt to replace coarse food. This way, she could earn one hundred and thirty yuan a day. But she could only use less than fifty yuan to maintain her meager life, and the rest was not even enough to pay for the levies and forced contributions.

　　After the grievances were expressed, the leadership followed up to raise the masses' awareness: "Who caused these grievances?" "The bailiffs, the heads of the jia!" "Who do the bailiffs and heads of the jia rely on?" "The street chief! The town chief!" "Who do the street chief and town chief rely on?" "The Kang family (whose son is the head of the finance section in the puppet county government and the richest and most powerful on the street) and the Japanese!" It turns out that all those who cause us suffering are in the same gang, and the suffering poor should also be in the same gang! This clarified the camps and inspired everyone's desire to unite and organize.

　　On April 2nd, more than 1,000 people from Ma City Street and other streets who came to observe jointly struggled against Kang Xiaoyun (puppet finance section chief), Fu Dengkui (town chief), and Gao Tang (street chief). The meeting lasted for three days. Each day, because there were too many people wanting to speak, it couldn't be adjourned. Those who attended this meeting still get excited when they talk about it. They truly overthrew the old rulers and turned themselves over. Their awareness has been raised to such an extent that when electing representatives to the National Assembly, many masses enthusiastically said: "The reactionaries on our street have been overthrown, but the reactionaries in all of China are still there. We must elect the most capable people to go to Nanjing to fight the reactionaries!" At this time, the number of poor people's association members in Ma City Street increased to 535, women's association members to 508, and militia members to 31. The organized masses exceeded half of the street's population.

　　III. Distributing the Fruits, Organizing Production.

　　Fair and reasonable distribution of the fruits of struggle is necessary to make cadres and the masses more united after the struggle and quickly organize and shift towards production.

　　How to achieve fairness and reasonableness? The main thing is to persuade cadres and activists to recognize that leading the masses in struggle is to serve the masses, not just to get a larger share of the fruits for themselves, and then conduct democratic discussions and reasonable distribution, so that cadres and the masses are all convinced.

　　Now, Ma City Street has a coal factory opened by the masses themselves, with more than 240 households investing in it. Xingtai has many coal factories established by the masses with the fruits of struggle, but this factory is the most profitable and best managed. In addition, twenty-eight mutual aid groups have been organized, with each group ranging from three to fourteen people, engaged in agriculture, commerce, and transportation, among other productions. It is now very difficult to find the committee members of the poor people's association because they are all leading mutual aid groups in production. They have a resounding saying: "It's only considered good leadership when the masses are all rich." Yin Xiang'ai, the leader of a women's cloth vending mutual aid group, told me how she carried cloth on her back for more than ninety li under the scorching sun to enable the group members to earn more profit, and couldn't even bear to buy a bowl of cold noodles. In Ma City Street, there are very many moving stories similar to this middle-aged woman with bound feet.

　　In the struggle, Ma City Street saw the emergence of a group of cadres and activists who were loyal to serving the masses, and under their leadership, a vigorous upsurge of production mutual aid was set off.

　　马市街群众的翻身
    吴象
    邢台南关马市街，有五百二十户二千余人，其中大部分是小贩，佃户，洋车夫，铁工和皮毛工人。多少年来，他们喘息在层层的压迫剥削之下衣食无着，而现在，他们觉悟起来团结起来成为马市街的主人了。他们英勇的翻身斗争，提供了发动城市群众的可贵的经验。
    一、发现问题，突破难关。
    三月间，区上派人深入马市街的群众运动，在这以前，已经进行过反汉奸孟云达的斗争，但是参加的人不普遍，群众没有真正发动起来。
    有一次街长王万祥召集群众开会，从下午三点一直开到晚上一点，都是他一个人在讲话，他毫不感到没有群众发言是个失败，反而得意自己的能说。会后他向区上的同志夸耀：“不用布置，俺们四个人包斗！”
    王万祥家是个回民，祖父父亲都是教长，有骑在群众头上的恶习惯。但是问题不仅在于王万祥，其他成份很好的干部积极分子，由于在运动之后没得到进一步的教育，也同样的缺乏群众观点民主作风。这些人在以往的斗争中是起了作用的，在现在运动深入的时候却不能继续成为骨干，甚至有的要成为障碍了。
    应该怎样对待这些干部积极分子呢？是推开他们？或者是帮助与改造他们。领导上采取的方针是后者，亲自深入访问群众，并以访问所得，教育干部积极分子。
    几天之后，在群众中发现了王宝平、王治中、陈文林、郝锁子等人，他们诉了许多苦：支夫，派款，讹诈………而且提出：群众不诉苦，因为受气的多是外乡人，怕斗不过本地的大户。认为“挨过的打，揭不下来，”“出过手的钱，收不回来，”已经吃过的亏就算了，怕“变天”，怕八路军站不长。
    召集这些人与原来的干部积极分子一齐开会，使大家认识群众有许多苦是因为有顾虑不敢诉，动员大家都下去作个别访问，“串连”。新积极分子在“串连”中见别人不说，自己就先诉苦给他听，去启发他的觉悟。旧积极分子多半不是这样：“有苦没有？”“有！”“对！到会上可得说呵！”
    每天晚上汇报检查：“串连”了几个人？怎样串连的？从讨论串连的方式——“用鞭子赶羊呢，还是站在群众之中？”引导大家认识到为群众服务才是个好干部，展开思想反省。批判了过去个别积极分子不愿与群众分斗争果实，接受坏人礼物的错误。在这样教育之下原来干部积极分子中的路秀山、徐会民、田一祥等，继续成为群众最爱戴的领袖。
    解决了干部问题，突破了难关，局面于是就打开了。
    二、放手发动，联合斗争。
    三天功夫，积极分子从二十多人增加到一百多人，运动普遍到每个角落，到处在诉苦，串连。领导上不拘于几个固定的积极分子，只要放手诉苦，带领群众起来的，都把他团结起来给以教育，再让他去团结与教育别人。
    群众是真正的起来了，这里可以看出区别于农村的城市贫民的特点：他们互相间非常缺乏联系，往往隔壁甚至同院的邻居而不知道姓名。各有各自不同的职业和生活。他们都要求诉苦，然而各人诉苦的内容，性质和对象又是不同的。
    领导上没有使诉苦局限于某一问题，而根据实际情况提出：“有什么苦，诉什么苦！”
    最多的支夫问题：街上三分之一以上的人是不出夫。而且还要从中贪污中饱的，这些人是镇长、街长、保长、甲长、公所书记、伪军政人员家属及其亲戚朋友和爪牙。全部夫差的重担压在不到三分之二最贫苦的群众身上。两天一个五天三个是出得最少的，一般的是一天一个，多的两天要出三个。老汉达久绪把公所向他要夫的条子粘在一起，比五块烧饼垒起来还厚。那里面的血和泪是数不尽说不完的。
    其次是派款和各种勒索。许多人因为出不起棉花而失去了自己仅有的破被子，因为出不起铜被砸被了门窗和箱柜，那上面薄薄的铜片也不能剩下。罗二妮的男人，一个做毛线的工人，是支夫挨打生气病死的，她带着两个不到七岁的小女孩无以为生，但是夫还是要出，没有人就出钱，一百二十元一个。她卖光了最后的破家具之后，只好带看孩子到西山上去弄石头来做石雕卖，每天起五更打黑，中午紧一紧裤带来代替粗粝的食物。这样每天可得一百三十元。但她只能以不足五十元的数目维持可怜的生命，其余都应付了差款还不够。
    展开了诉苦之后，领导上就追根来提高群众的认识：“这些苦是谁给的”？“保长、甲长！”“保长甲长靠谁？”“街长！镇长！”“街长镇长又靠谁？”“康家（儿子在伪县府当财政科长，在街上最有钱有势）和日本人！”使大家受苦的原来都是一伙，受苦的穷人也应该是一伙呵！这样划清了阵营，启发大家团结起来组织起来的要求。
    四月二日，马市街和别的街来参观的群众一千多人，联合斗争康肖云（伪财政科长）傅登魁（镇长）和高堂（街长），会议连续了三天，每天因为要求发言的人太多而不能休会。参加过这个会的人，到现在一谈起还会立时兴奋起来。他们是真正的摧垮旧的统治者，翻过身来了。他们的觉悟已提高到这样的程度，选举国大代表的时候，许多群众都热情地说：“我们街上的反动派打倒了，但全中国的反动派还在，我们要选举最能干的人，到南京去和反动派斗争！”这时候，马市街贫民会员增加到五百三十五人，妇救会员五百零八人，民兵三十一人，有组织的群众超过全街人口的半数。
    三、分配果实，组织生产
    公平合理的分配斗争果实，才能使干部群众在斗争后更加团结，迅速的组织起来转向生产。
    怎样做到公平合理呢？主要的是要说服干部积极分子，使他们认识带领群众斗争，是为群众服务，不只是为了自己多分果实，然后进行民主讨论，合理分配，使干部群众都心服。
    现在，马市街有个群众自己开的煤厂，二百四十多户都入了股。邢台有许多群众以斗争果实举办的煤厂，这个厂获利最大，经营最得法。另外，组织了二十八个互助小组，每组三个人到十四个人不等，从事农业、商业、及运输等生产，贫民会的委员们现在很不容易找到，他们都领导互助组搞生产去了。他们中有一句响亮的话：“群众都发了财才算领导得好。”一个妇女贩布互助组的组长尹香爱，告诉我她为了使组员们多获一些利，如何在烈日之下背着布赶九十多里路，连买碗凉粉都舍不得。在马市街，同这个中年小脚妇女同样动人的事迹是非常多的。
    马市街在斗争中涌现了一批忠诚为群众服务的干部积极分子，在他们带领之下，又轰轰烈烈的掀起生产互助的热潮了。
