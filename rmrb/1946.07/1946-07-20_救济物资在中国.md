Relief Supplies in China

According to news reports from various locations, the vast majority of relief supplies shipped to China by UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) did not reach the starving and impoverished people. Instead, they were embezzled and stolen by corrupt officials within the Kuomintang, and even exploited by warmongers as tools to expand China’s civil war and famine.

Powerful bureaucrats used various methods to embezzle relief supplies. These supplies often disappeared before reaching the areas in need. In Guangdong alone, over ten thousand bags of relief grain went missing, including the nine thousand bags of flour that “disappeared in transit” in March, the three hundred bags of relief flour that were “blown into the sea” in May, the five thousand bags of relief rice that “sank in a ship” on June 4th, and the four thousand bags of relief rice “stolen” in Hong Kong on June 9th. One journalist wrote: “God! Why doesn’t such a strong wind blow away the relief officials too?”

Open or secret selling was another method. By the end of June, the Kuomintang government’s “Executive Headquarters” had, under the pretext of using the funds for relief administrative expenses, sold 66,668 tons of relief flour in Shanghai, accounting for over one-third of all relief flour shipped to Shanghai (200,400 tons). In addition, they sold 5,556 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of wheat bran. Supplies transported to various locations, such as Western suits and high-heeled shoes in Peiping (Beijing), Kaifeng, Hunan, and other places, were auctioned off by officials under the pretext that “disaster victims have no use for these,” but the proceeds went straight into their own pockets. As for relief flour and rice, in Changsha, even before the disaster victims received them, they were already flowing into large restaurants and warehouses at a price of 300 yuan per jin. In Jiangxi, even the Ta Kung Pao newspaper said: “Except for a very small amount, they are all sold to merchants, becoming cakes, chicken cakes, and small steamed buns… for the rich who have rice to eat.” Relief food in Shantou and Wenzhou also appeared on the market.

After layers of "filtering," the small amount of "surplus" relief goods that were intended to be distributed were also problematic. In Hunan in May, foreign UNRRA personnel, seeing the rampant corruption in the distribution, advocated for direct distribution and sent people to the countryside to supervise. However, after the emergency relief team left, local county governments forced the beneficiaries to return the payments or, under the pretext of redistribution, squeezed out these relief goods again. The actual amount received by the disaster victims was minimal. In Qiyang, Hunan, each person received less than half a jin of flour per month, and in Gaoyao, Guangdong, disaster victims have so far received only eight qian of rice per person, while soldiers went to the countryside every day to collect grain and demand payment, forcing them to hand over many times more grain, until they sold their fields and property, and sold their children.

Relief supplies became objects for bureaucrats to make fortunes and tools for them to hoard and create disasters. The Guangzhou Qianfeng Daily, in an editorial titled “Exposing the Inside Story of Man-Made Rice Shortages,” said: “For releasing flour and distributing rice, rice prices will only rise and not fall. Such an inside story is definitely not something that one or two people dare to do; there must be many people involved.” Precisely because of this, in many places, shameless people openly engaged in a scramble for relief supplies. In June, the Hunan Provincial Assembly hotly debated and redefined relief standards. One senator said, “This is a discussion about dividing the spoils.” Even the deputy director of the Hunan Executive Headquarters Relief Branch admitted that when organizing the “Emergency Relief Team,” the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and gangs fought with each other, taking the emergency relief work into their own hands, “making things easier for themselves.” The common people were used to this, so in the Jiangzhe area, they called the Kuomintang’s Relief Department the “Self-Relief Department,” and in Hunan, it was called the “Relief Relief Department.”

Most seriously, the warmongers within the Kuomintang used relief supplies for the civil war. As early as February 25th of this year, a United Press reporter reported that Chinese and foreign reactionaries were “playing tricks on the Relief Administration.” They tried their best to prevent relief supplies, especially food, from being transported to the Shandong Liberated Area, openly telling UNRRA staff that they “wanted to use relief supplies to open up the Jiaoji Railway.” In April of this year, the 20,000 shi of relief rice shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong was also openly declared to be transferred to military rations. And the 4,200 bags of UNRRA rice seized in Guangzhou in mid-June were clearly marked on the manifest as being for the use of the 54th Army. The relief grain transported to Haizhou in northern Jiangsu, Liaocheng in Shandong, and Yongnian in Hebei was even supplied to puppet troops, leading to the food-grabbing struggles of nearly ten thousand starving people in Haizhou on May 14th and 15th. As for using UNRRA supplies to supply the financial expenses of the civil war, this is not surprising. As early as March of this year, Kuomintang Finance Minister Yu Hongjun openly reported at the Political Participation Council that UNRRA relief supplies would be used as one of the “financial resources” to “balance revenue and expenditure.” Because of this, the supplies to relieve the Chinese people have become tools for massacring the Chinese people.

### 救济物资在中国

　　救济物资在中国
    根据各地报纸消息，联总运华的绝大部分救济物资，并没有落到饥困的人民手中，而为国民党内腐败官吏所中饱窃盗，甚至被好战派利用为扩大中国内战和饥荒的工具。
    有势力的官僚们，用各种的办法吞没救济物资。在这些物资运到需要地区前，往往即告失踪。单广东一地前后失踪的救济粮食，就达一万多包，包括三月间“失投”的九千包面粉，五月间“吹到海里去”的救济粉三百包，六月四日“沉船”的五千包救济米，同月九日在香港“失盗”的救济米四千包。一位记者曾写过：“上帝呀！这样大的风，为什么不连救济官员也一起吹走”？
    公开的或偷偷的盗卖是另一方法，到六月下旬止，国民党政府“行总”借口充作救济行政费，在上海擅自出卖的救济面共达六万六千六百六十八吨，占全部运沪救济面（二十万零四千吨）三分之一强。此外并售卖小麦五千五百五十六吨，麸皮一万五千吨。运至各地的物资，如西装、高跟鞋在北平、开封、湖南等地，都被官吏们以“灾民用不到这些而拍卖，但拍卖所得，却都装进了他们的钱袋。至于救济面救济米，在长沙则在灾民领到以前，早就以三百元一斤的代价，源源流入大饭馆与堆栈。在江西连大公报也说：“除极少数外，都卖给商人了，变成了有米吃的富人们的饼子、鸡蛋糕、小笼包……一类的东西了”。其他汕头、温州救济食粮，都在市场上出现。
    经过层层的“过滤”，打算还有小量的“剩余”救济品发下去，在湖南五月间联总外籍人员，看到发赈时弊病丛生，主张直接发放，并派人下乡监视；可是等急赈队走后，各地县政府就迫令受赈者，把账款缴回，或借口重新分配，把这些赈品再榨出来，实际发到灾民手里的数目是微乎其微的。湖南的祁阳每月每人领不到半斤面，广东高要直到现在灾民每人只领到了八钱米，而枪杆子却天天下乡追粮索款，迫使他们缴出无数倍于此的粮食，直到变田变产，卖儿卖女。
    救济物资成为官僚们发财致富的对象，成了他们囤积造灾的工具。广州前锋日报在“揭穿人为米荒的黑幕”一篇社论里说：“对于放面粉发赈米，米价只会高升而无下降，此种黑幕，决非一二人员所胆敢作为，当然大有人在”。正因为此，许多地方那些不知廉耻的人们，公然展开对救济物资的争夺战，六月间湖南省参议会热烈讨论，重新确定救济标准，某参议员说“这是讨论分赃”。甚至湖南行总救济分署副署长也承认在组织“急赈队”时，国民党、三青团、帮派三者之间，你争我夺，把急赈工作搞到自己手里，“这事情就好办了”。老百姓看惯了这一套，所以在江浙一带称国民党的救济署为“救己署”，湖南则称为“救济救济署”。
    最严重的是国民党内的好战分子，把救济物资用于内战。合众社记者早在今年二月二十五日就报导过中外反动派“对救济总署耍弄阴谋”。他们竭力反对把救济品特别是粮食，运至山东解放区，公开告诉联总工作人员，他们“要用救济品打通胶济路”。今年四月间由上海运粤的两万石救济米，亦被公开宣布移作军粮。而六月中在广州查获的四千二百包联总米，发单上明明注着系供陆军第五十四军军用。运到苏北海州的，山东聊城河北永年等地的救济粮，竟供给伪军。致海州曾激起五月十四、十五日近万饥民的抢粮斗争。至于以联总物资供应内战的财政开销，这是不奇怪的，早在今年三月国民党政府财政部长俞鸿钧就在参政会上公开报告，要把联总救济物资，作为“平衡收支”的“财源”之一。正因为这样，救济中国人民的物资，变成屠杀中国人民的工具了。
