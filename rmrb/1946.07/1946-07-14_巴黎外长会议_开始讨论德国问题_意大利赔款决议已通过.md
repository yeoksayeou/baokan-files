Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 11th: Paris dispatch: After twenty-two days of intense work, the Foreign Ministers Conference is now making its best efforts to finally adjourn at the end of this week. The Foreign Ministers' assistants have been ordered to prepare the treaties for Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland by July 13th, and the Foreign Ministers Conference may approve these treaties that afternoon.

　　On July 9th, the Foreign Ministers Conference officially began discussing the German issue. At the previous Foreign Ministers Conference, the United States proposed a draft treaty to end the occupation of Germany and disarm Germany, and also proposed convening an Allied conference on the 11th to discuss the unresolved issues of the German peace treaty. At that time, the United States, Britain, and France agreed to the Soviet Union's proposal to investigate the disarmament of the German army, but it failed due to US obstruction. On July 9th, Byrnes re-submitted his previous draft of the twenty-five-year treaty on Germany and urged the conference to pass it, but it was refuted by Molotov. Molotov delivered a long speech at the meeting, strongly emphasizing the necessity of thoroughly implementing the Crimea and Potsdam Conference decisions on Germany, and considered Byrnes' draft to be very unsatisfactory. Molotov pointed out that the Allied forces of the United States and Britain and the Soviet army occupied Germany for three purposes: (1) to ensure the thorough implementation of the disarmament of Germany in military and economic terms; (2) to ensure the democratization of the German system; (3) to ensure the payment of reparations. He said that in the US proposal, the task regarding the first point was reduced, and the second and third points were not mentioned at all. In his conclusion, he declared: Before the three tasks are carried out, the Soviet Union believes that the continued stationing of occupying forces in Germany and the protection of the occupied areas are absolutely necessary.

　　On July 10th, the four Foreign Ministers continued to discuss the German issue. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin, with the support of Byrnes, proposed a plan for a certain federalization of Germany, which is now divided into four occupation zones. Bidault largely agreed with Molotov's views. Details of the discussion are not yet known.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 9th: Paris dispatch: On July 9th, the Foreign Ministers reviewed the organizational rules of the peace conference. The US, British, and French Foreign Ministers have agreed to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal that the peace treaties be negotiated separately by the countries that fought against the five defeated countries. The decision on the organizational rules of the peace conference will be made by five committees. At Byrnes' proposal, France was also included in the five committees. After Bevin requested it, the four powers also agreed that a minority of countries within any of the five committees, less than two-thirds, would have the right to express their opinions to the conference. If there is fundamentally no two-thirds vote, the committee can submit two or more reports to the conference. The invitation agreed upon by the four powers stated: In order to facilitate the work of the peace conference, proposals related to organization and procedural rules will be submitted to the peace conference for research. At the meeting on July 9th, the resolution on Italian reparations was finally passed. The issue of Italian reparations to other countries is expected to be explained in the draft peace treaty. Regarding the demands of other countries, such as France, Greece, and Albania, the amount of reparations and their sources will be reviewed by the peace conference and decided by the peace conference.

　　巴黎外长会议
　  开始讨论德国问题
　  意大利赔款决议已通过
    【新华社延安十一日电】巴黎讯：外长会议于紧张的工作二十二天之后，现正尽最大之努力以期于本周周末最后休会。外长助理已受命在七月十三日以前，将对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约备妥，外长会议或将于该日下午批准这些条约。
    七月九日外长会议正式开始讨论德国问题。在上届外长会议上，美国曾提出了结束对德占领与解除德国武装的条约草案，并曾提议于十一日召集盟国会议，讨论对德和约的未获协议。当时美、英、法、虽曾同意苏联关于调查德军解除武装情形的建议，但后来由于美方的阻挠而未果。七月九日贝纳斯又重提他过去所提出的对德二十五年条约草案，并督促会议通过之，但为莫洛托夫所批驳。莫洛托夫在会上发表长篇演说，力言彻底实现克里米亚与波茨顿会议对德决定的必要，并认为贝纳斯的草案非常不能令人满意。莫洛托夫指陈美英盟军与苏军占领德国有三个目的：（１）保证彻底实现在军事与经济方面解除德国武装。（２）保证德国制度的民主化。（３）保证偿付赔款。他说美国的提案中，关于第一点的任务被缩小了，而第二、三两点则完全没有提到。他于结语中宣称：在三个任务没有执行以前，苏联认为占领军继续驻德，与保护占领区是绝对必要的。
    七月十日四外长继续讨论德国问题。据悉：英外相贝文在贝纳斯支援下，提出现在分为四个占领区的德国，规定某种联邦化的计划。而比道尔则大致同意莫洛托夫的观点。讨论详情尚未知悉。
    【新华社延安九日电】巴黎讯：七月九日各外长审查了和会的组织规则，美、英、法外长已同意苏外长莫洛托夫的建议，即和约将由曾与五个战败国中作战之各国分别××，和会组织规则等的决定，组成五个委员会处理，经贝纳斯提议，法国亦被列入五个委员会中，后经贝文要求，四强又同意五委员会中任何一委员会内三分之二以外之少数国，有权向大会表示意见，若根本无三分之二之表决，则委员会可向大会提出两个以上之报告。四强同意之请柬称：为便于和会工作进行，有关组织及有关程序规则之诸项提议，交和会研究之。七月九日的会议上，还最后通过了意大利赔款的决议，关于意大利对其他各国的赔款问题，预定在和约草案中说明。关于其他各国的要求，如法国、希腊、阿尔巴尼亚等国的，经和会审查，由和会决定赔款数额及来源。
