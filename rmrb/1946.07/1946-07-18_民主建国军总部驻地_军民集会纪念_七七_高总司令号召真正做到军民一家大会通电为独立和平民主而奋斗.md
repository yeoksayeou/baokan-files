　　【Reported from Handan by our newspaper】 The Democratic National Construction Army, together with the masses in Yicheng Town, Wu'an County, where the army's headquarters is located, held a "July 7th" Commemoration Meeting on the afternoon of July 7th. More than 10,000 soldiers and civilians attended the meeting, with large and small banners fluttering all over the venue, reading "Defend the Fruits of Victory of the War of Resistance," "Oppose Civil War," "Oppose Selling Out the Motherland," and "Oppose U.S. Armed Intervention in China's Internal Affairs."

　　In his speech at the meeting, Commander-in-Chief Gao first recounted that the arduous struggle of the eight-year War of Resistance was for the independence of the country and the freedom of the people. However, today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, there are still foreign troops freely stationed in our country, which is our greatest shame. Recalling the past civil wars, sacrificing for the rule of a minority was truly not worth it. He called on the troops to truly achieve unity between the military and the people, become an army of the people, and strive for China's independence, peace, and democracy.

　　Deputy Commander-in-Chief Liao, Political Department Director Wang, Deputy Division Commander Nie, who had just returned from a visit to Yan'an, and representatives of the people all delivered speeches in angry and impassioned tones, unanimously expressing their opposition to civil war, opposition to U.S. imperialist elements helping Chiang Kai-shek fight a civil war, and opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the motherland.

　　After the meeting, soldiers and civilians held a joint celebration until late at night before dispersing. (Si Shi)
　　
　　【Reported from Handan on the 15th by our newspaper】 (Delayed) The Democratic National Construction Army and the people of the stationed area jointly held a ten-thousand-person "July 7th" Commemoration Meeting, issuing a circular telegram calling on compatriots throughout the country to intensify their unity and continue their efforts to fight against civil war and U.S. armed intervention. The original telegram briefly stated: In order to strive for independence, peace, and democracy, compatriots across the country have already paid immense sacrifices and costs during the eight-year War of Resistance. However, after the victory of the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang reactionaries attempted to plunder the fruits of victory of the War of Resistance, instead launching a civil war and massacring their own compatriots. Therefore, we in Handan have raised the banner of opposing civil war and striving for democracy. Because the reactionaries recognize the invincibility of the people's power, they do not hesitate to sell out the interests of the nation and the country in exchange for military assistance from U.S. imperialism, creating a serious crisis of losing national independence. We, the ten thousand soldiers and civilians commemorating "July 7th," especially appeal to compatriots throughout the country to intensify their unity and continue to fight to the end for the survival and liberation of the nation, and for the independence and democracy of the country. Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression, oppose armed interference in China's internal affairs, and demand the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. Oppose the fascist reactionaries' sinful policy of selling out the country, waging civil war, and dictatorship, and oppose secret agents assassinating patriotic democratic人士. Demand that the Kuomintang comprehensively cease the civil war and faithfully fulfill the Three Agreements.

　　民主建国军总部驻地
    军民集会纪念“七七”
    高总司令号召真正做到军民一家大会通电为独立和平民主而奋斗
    【本报邯郸讯】民主建国军在该军总部驻地——武安邑城镇于七月七日下午与驻地群众共同举行“七七”纪念大会，到会军民万余人，全场飘扬着“保卫抗战胜利果实”，“反对内战”，“反对出卖祖国”，“反对美国武装干涉中国内政”等大小旗帜。
    高总司令在大会的讲话中，首先述说着八年抗战的艰苦奋斗是为了国家的独立与人民的自由，而在抗战胜利后的今天，还有外国军队在国内自由驻扎，这是我们最大的耻辱，回忆过去打内战，为了少数人的统治而牺牲，真是太不值得，他号召部队真正做到军民一家，成为人民的军队，为中国的独立、和平、民主而奋斗。”
    廖副总司令、政治部王主任刚从延安参观归来的聂副师长及民众代表均以愤激沉痛的语调，相继讲演，一致表示反对内战，反对美帝国主义分子帮助蒋介石打内战，反对蒋介石出卖祖国的行为。
    会后军民举行联欢晚会至深夜方散。（四石）
    【本报邯郸十五日电】（迟到）民主建国军与驻地人民共同举行之万人纪念“七七”大会发出通电，号召全国同胞，加紧团结继续努力，为反对内战、反对美国武装干涉而奋斗。原电略称：为了争取独立和平与民主八年抗战全国同胞已付出莫大的牺牲与代价，但在抗战胜利后，国民党反动派企图劫夺抗战胜利的果实，却发动内战，屠杀自己的同胞，所以我们在邯郸举起反对内战与争取民主的旗帜。由于反动派认识人民力量的不可战胜，不惜出卖国家民族的利益，换取美帝国主义的军事援助，造成了丧失国家独立的严重危机。我们纪念“七七”的万余军民，特向全国同胞呼吁加紧团结，为民族的生存与解放，为国家的独立与民主，继续奋斗到底。坚决反对美帝国主义侵略，反对武装干涉中国内政，要求美军全部撤离中国。反对法西斯反动派卖国内战独裁的罪恶政策，反对特务杀害爱国民主志士。要求国民党全面停止内战，忠实履行三大协议。
