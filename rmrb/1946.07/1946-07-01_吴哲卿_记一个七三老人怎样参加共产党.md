　　Wu Zheqing
    ——Remembering How a 73-Year-Old Man Joined the Communist Party
    Wu Xiang
    As I begin to write about Wu Zheqing, I can't help but think of Taofen, and his will, on his deathbed, requesting to join the Communist Party. This great warrior, who deeply loved the people, firmly believed that the Communist Party was the hope of the Chinese people, and therefore wished to entrust his fate to it, a desire that remained as fervent as fire until his last breath.
    Wu Zheqing is different from Taofen; he is merely a man with a rudimentary knowledge of writing. However, born into a poor peasant family in the first year of the Guangxu reign, carrying a simple and kind heart, and having experienced a lifetime of disasters and changes, he, at the advanced age of seventy-three, requested to join the Chinese Communist Party. This cannot but equally startle and move people.
    "What kind of person is he? Why does he want to join the Communist Party?" I went to visit him with this question in mind.
    It was during the first session of the second conference of the Border Region Assembly held in Handan in March. It should be noted that the councilors' time is very tight. After the general assembly, there are also group meetings and various specialized meetings, and there is very little rest at night. He was also on the presidium, which meant even more work. I met him in between two meetings.
    "It's alright, it's alright, let's talk! I feel uncomfortable when I'm idle," he interrupted my unfinished apologies and warmly pulled me into the room. He is from Zhuangping and speaks a loud Shandong dialect.
    Once we were all seated, I observed that he was very thin but full of vigor, often stroking his sparse beard. He wore a small comb on his black cloth gown. His backwards-combed, graying long hair and his old-fashioned glasses perched on his nose seemed to belong to the Qing Dynasty. The first feeling that arose in my mind was: an ancient attire, concealing a vibrant, youthful heart. The more our conversation continued, the stronger this feeling became. He was not deaf, his eyesight was still good, and he didn't seem to tire. Every word and action overflowed with ample energy and enthusiasm.
    His family only had a dozen mu of land, and it has always been this much. During the Guangxu era, he rose from being a soldier to the commander of a cavalry battalion. This was a lucrative position; one could build a garden by slightly over-reporting the amount of horse feed. However, he not only opposed corruption and maintained his integrity but also donated some of the money he was entitled to for public works, repairing bridges and roads, and helping the poor. Later, he became a doctor and opened a pharmacy, directly serving the villagers who were suffering from illness and poverty.
    "I even repaired temples – back then, my thinking was different, and I was very superstitious!" He smiled with some embarrassment.
    Then, he spoke about his sons. Both of his sons sacrificed themselves for the War of Resistance. His eldest son, Wenqing, was a finance clerk who was buried alive by the traitor Qi Zixiu in 1939. His second son, Yawu, was an elected anti-Japanese county magistrate who died in 1942 during the anti-"mopping-up" operation in Yanggu.
    "He stood on the mound, using his pistol to kill five Japanese soldiers and a machine gunner. Finally, with only one bullet left, he killed himself." He narrated the heroic sacrifice of his son without showing grief, his eyes radiating with solemn glory.
    "Sad?" He repeated my question, saying frankly: "Of course, I was sad for a few days, but they sacrificed themselves for the country, which is glorious!" He told me that this news was still being concealed from his son's mother. She is now seventy-three years old and, along with his eldest daughter-in-law and granddaughter, works in a shoe factory, while his second daughter-in-law teaches in a primary school.
    He was arrested twice. He joked, "If it weren't for my age, I probably wouldn't be alive today." Actually, what saved him was not his age, but his tenacity and determination, the tenacity and determination of an old pine and cypress.
    During the anti-"mopping-up" operation in June 1941, he transferred to the outer lines and lived in a relative's house in Xiliang Village near Jinan. Soon, he was discovered by a traitor and taken to the city. After being forced to drink a lot of cold water and chili powder, he said: "Even if you beat me to death, I am not a member of the Eighth Route Army. Why would they want an old man like me? They are all young heroes!" So the enemy changed their tactics. Morimoto, the commander of the military police, invited him to dinner and told him through a translator: "Don't hide it from me, I know your son is a county magistrate in the Eighth Route Army, with very good credentials. You write a letter asking him to come, and I'll give him the position of commissioner, and you can be a councilor in the provincial government and enjoy the good life!"
    "He is a county magistrate, but not appointed by the Eighth Route Army, but elected by the people. No one can order him around."
    "Write a letter, just try it!"
    "He is always fighting guerrilla warfare, here today and there tomorrow, what letter can I write?"
    He never agreed to anything. However, Morimoto did not let him go. He sent a traitor to escort him by car to Zhuangping City, instructing him to find a way to induce his son, the anti-Japanese county magistrate, to surrender. He found an opportunity and escaped along the familiar paths of his hometown. He found his son, told him everything with a smile, and scolded the Japanese devils for their stupidity, and more resolutely insisted on fighting. He endured hardships without complaint, sleeping in the wild and traveling in the dark with the young people…. At that time, he was serving as the Director of the Trade Bureau.
    During the anti-"mopping-up" operation in 1942, because the war was too severe, he transferred again to the outer lines for hidden activities. Unfortunately, he was discovered and captured again by the enemy and sent to the Jinan Military Police Headquarters. This time, the enemy was even more cruel to him, repeatedly torturing him to the point of death, then reviving him with cold water. In the end, he coldly said: "Kill me! You won't get anything out of this hard bone of mine. I have lived this long, and I am not afraid to die!" With a pistol pointed at his nose, he was stripped naked, revealing his emaciated body, his hands bound and unable to move. But he did not flinch or tremble, clearly uttering sonorous words. Even the black-hearted translator and the executioners could not help but secretly shed tears. The enemy finally had no choice but to release him.
    The people of Zhuangping praised his heroic deeds and elected him as a councilor twice in a row. Is there anything else to say? Is there anything else to say about his humility and diligence in his work? Is there anything else to say about those things he personally weighed and fairly priced at the Trade Bureau? I think it's unnecessary. No one can fail to express their highest respect for this old gentleman who loves his country, loves his people, and becomes younger as he gets older.
    "Since I grew up, I have been running around in society for more than fifty years, and I have not seen anyone who truly loves the people. But the Communist Party truly loves the people!" He said this with exclamation! Because like many older people, years of deceitful propaganda made him initially prejudiced and disgusted with the Communist Party. In 1937, when he heard that his sons had become Communist Party members, he became very angry, thinking that they had all drunk the Communist Party's "potion." Later, he was in charge of provisions in the county. When the troops came, they would ask for provisions for 300 people even if there were only 100, and would beat people if they were a little slow. One day, the Eighth Route Army came for the first time. Thirty-odd people only asked for fifty jin of steamed buns, and before leaving, they returned the remaining three jin and more, wrote a note, and cleaned up the place where they stayed. Afterwards, they continued to come like this. His eyes brightened. What were these people doing? His simple and kind heart made him have to doubt whether he should hate the Communist Party. At that time, the county magistrate Ge Donghua (who later became a traitor) ordered that no food should be given to the Eighth Route Army, but he said: "They are all fighting the Japanese, why not give it to them?" This was a starting point. He stepped on this starting point and moved forward tirelessly, unable and unwilling to stop. He saw the Kuomintang army abandoning the land and people of the motherland, while the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army were advancing into the enemy's rear, relying on the people and leading the people, defeating stubborn enemies with inferior weapons, reclaiming lost land with blood, and gradually building it into a paradise for the people under the conditions of war. Thousands of years of darkness, oppression, and ignorance began to be replaced by light, happiness, and joy. "I have been thinking about it for many years, and now I have seen it with my own eyes. In the past, I spent all my energy to save a few people? The bad guys are still the same bad guys. Now, with the implementation of the Communist Party's policies, the poor everywhere have turned over. The bad guys can no longer survive. If you follow the Communist Party, China will have a way out." His words, together with his expression and tone when he spoke, deeply moved me. If there was no deep sympathy for the fate of the people, if there was no determination to dedicate himself to the people's cause of the Communist Party, could his words, his expression, and his tone carry so much love, so much heat, and so much power?
    "I won't be able to see the communist society in China, but I always want to see China get better quickly. Don't look at me as old, I will fight to the end as long as I have a breath!" Talking about the news that his application to join the Party had been approved, he became excited and his face shone with joy. He added excitedly: "Finding this bright road has fulfilled my lifelong aspiration."
    The great American writer Dreiser said at the end of his article "Why I Joined the Communist Party": "Belief in the greatness and dignity of mankind has always been the guiding principle of my life and work. The logic of my life and work ultimately led me to request to join the Communist Party." Similarly, it can be said that anyone who loves the Chinese people and strives for China's bright happiness will eventually wish to combine their own fate with the Communist Party, because the Communist Party is the hope of the Chinese people.

　　吴哲卿
    ——记一个七三老人怎样参加共产党
    吴象
    我提起笔来写吴哲卿，却不禁想起韬奋，想起他弥留时请求加入共产党的遗嘱。这位挚爱人民的伟大战士，笃信共产党是中国人民的希望，因而愿望着把自己的命运交托给它，这愿望直到停止呼吸，还是同火一样的热烈。
    吴哲卿与韬奋不同，他只是个粗通文字的人。然而他从光绪元年诞生于贫苦的农家，抱着质朴的善良的心，经历了一生的灾难和变动之后，竟以七十三岁的高龄，请求加入中国共产党。这却不能不使人同样的惊动与感动。
    “他是个怎样的人呢？为什么他要参加共产党呢？”我带着这个问题去访问他。
    那是三月间边参会在邯郸举行一届二次大会的时候。应该说明，参议员的时间是很紧的，大会之后，还有小组会和各种专门性质的会，晚上也很少休息。他又在主席团，事情更多。我在两个会的间隙中会见了他。
    “不要紧，不要紧，咱们谈吧！我闲着反而不好受。”他打断了我没有说完的歉词，立即亲热地把我拉进了屋子。他是庄平人，满口响亮的山东话。
    大家都坐定了，他很瘦，但是精神矍铄，时常用手去捋那一撮稀疏的胡子。黑布长衫上挂着一个小篦子。他的倒梳的斑白的长发，他的架在鼻梁上的老花眼镜，似乎还是前清的样式。我脑中浮起的第一个感觉是：古老的装束，蕴藏着一颗跳跃的，年青的心。我们的谈话越继续下去，我这个感觉就越强烈，他耳不聋，眼还好，而且不知道疲倦，一句话，一个动作，都横溢着足够的精力和热情。
    他家只有十几亩地，一直还是这么多，光绪年间，他从当兵升到骑兵营长。这是个肥缺，稍为多报点马料就可以盖花园的。但是他不但反对贪污，廉洁自守，而且把自己份内应得一些钱也都捐给公益，修桥补路，救济贫穷。他后来当医生，开药铺，直接去为苦于疾病贫穷的乡亲服务。
    “还修庙呢——那个时候脑筋不同，迷信深得很！”他带点羞赧的笑了。
    接着，他说到他的儿子，他两个儿子都为抗战牺牲了，大儿文庆，是财政科员，三九年被汉奸齐子修活埋了，二儿亚屋，是民选的抗日县长，死于四二年阳谷反“扫荡”中。
    “他站在土岗上，用手枪打死五个鬼子，一个机枪射手，最后剩下一颗子弹，他自杀了。”他叙述着儿子壮烈的殉难，没有表现悲痛，眼里投射出睽矜光彩。
    “难过吗？”他重复了一下我的问话，坦直的说：“当然难过了几天，但是他们为国牺牲，是光荣的呀！”他告诉我这消息对儿子母亲还是隐瞒着的。她现在也七十三岁了，和大儿媳及孙女在鞋工厂做工，二儿媳则在小学里教书。
    他两次被捕。他开玩笑地说：“要不是我这一把年纪，怕已经活不成了。”其实使他得救的，不是年纪，而是顽强和坚决，老年苍松劲柏般的顽强和坚定。
    四一年六月反“扫荡时，他转移到外线，住在济南附近西梁庄亲戚家里，不久被汉奸发觉抓到城里去了。灌了许多凉水，辣椒面之后。他说：“打死我也不是八路军，人家会要我这老头子吗？人家都是年青青的英雄好汉！”于是敌人改变了策略，宪兵司令森本请他去吃饭，叫翻译对他说：“不用瞒我，我知道你儿子在八路军当县长，资格很好，你写信叫他来，我给他当专员，你在省政府当参议，享福！”
    “他是县长，不过不是八路军放的，是老百姓选的。谁也叫不动他”。
    “写一封，试试看！”
    “人家天天打游击，今天这里明天那里，写什么信？”
    他始终没有答应任何一件事，然而森本也不放松他，派了一个汉奸，送他坐汽车到庄平城，要他在那里设法诱降那个当抗日县长儿子，他寻找了一个机会，沿着熟悉的家乡的小路逃出来了。他找着儿子，笑着把一切都告诉了他。骂鬼子的蠢笨，并且更坚决的坚持着斗争。艰苦的毫无怨言的跟年青人一起在野地里露宿，在黑夜里奔波……。那时候他在当贸易局长。
    四二年反“扫荡”因为战争过于严重，他又转移到外线隐蔽活动。不幸又被敌人发觉捕去，送到济南宪兵司令部。这一回，敌人对他更残酷了，一次又一次的把他弄死，又用凉水喷活。最后，他还是冷冷的说：“杀了我吧！从我这硬骨头身上打不出什么话来的，我已经活了这么大，我决不怕死！”用手枪比着他的鼻尖，他被剥光衣服，露出瘦骨棱峋的身躯，双手被缚着伸不出来。但是他不畏缩不发抖，清醒地吐着铿锵发响的字句。使黑良心翻译和刑手都不得不偷偷掉泪敌人终于无可奈何的把他放了。
    庄平的人民都赞颂他英勇的事迹，连续两次选举他为参议员。还要再说别的吗？还要再说他待人谦和和工作的刻苦吗？还要再说他在贸易局亲自过秤过平的那些事情吗？我想都不用了，谁也不能不对这位热爱祖国热爱人民越老越年青的老先生表示崇高的敬意。
    “我从长大，在社会上奔走五十余年，没有见到真正爱护人民的人。而共产党是真正爱护人民”他说这话时发生了感叹的！因为他和许多老一辈的人，一样多年的欺骗宣传使他开始对共产党也抱着成见和厌恶，一九三七年，他听到自己的儿子都变成了共产党员时，他生了很大的气，认为他们都喝了共产党的“迷魂药”。后来他在县里办给养，队伍来了都是一百人要三百人的给养，慢了一点就要打人。有一天，第一次来了八路。三十多人只要了五十斤馍，临走还把剩下的三斤多送回，开好条子把住的地方都打扫得干干净净的。以后不断的过来都是这样。他的眼睁明亮起来。这些人是怎么搞的呢？他的质朴善良的心使他不得不怀疑自己是否应该厌恶共产党了，那时候县长葛栋华（后来当汉奸）下命令不准把粮食给八路军，他却说：“都是打日本，为什么不给？”这是个起点，他踏上这个起点就前进不息，不能也不愿再站住了，他看到国民党军队丢弃了祖国的土地和人民，而共产党八路军却向敌人后方挺进，依靠人民又领导人民，以低劣的武器战胜了顽强的敌人，用鲜血夺回了失去的土地，并且在战争的条件下逐渐把它建设为人民自己的乐园，几千年来的黑暗，压榨、愚昧、开始被光明、幸福、欢乐所代替。“我多少年前就想过的，我现在亲眼看到了，我过去费了全身的力气，救了几个人？坏蛋还是一样的坏，现在实行共产党的政策，到处的穷人都翻了身，坏蛋再也存不住了，跟着共产党走中国就有办法。”，他的话，连同他说话时的表情和声调，深深的打动了我，如果没有对人民命运的深厚的同情，如果没有为共产党的人民的事业献身的决心，他的话，他的表情和声调能带有这么大的爱这么大的热和力吆？
    “中国的共产主义社会我是看不到了，但是总想看到中国快一点都好起来。不要看我老了，我有一呼一吸一口气，也要奋斗到底的！”谈到入党被批准的消息，他激动起来脸因为喜悦而辉朗了他兴奋地加着说：“找到这个光明大道，完成了我一生的志愿。”
    美国大作家德莱塞在“在为什么加入共产党”一文的结尾说：“对于人类的伟大与尊严的信念，一直是我生命与工作的指导原则，我的生命与工作的逻辑，最后引导着我请求参加共产党。”同样可以说，任何热爱中国人民为中国的光明幸福奋斗的人，最后也一定愿望着他自己的命运与共产党结合起来，因为共产党是中国人民的希望。
