Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th. General Zhou Enlai, representative of the Chinese Communist Party, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in Nanjing at 7:00 PM on the 21st of this month. More than 30 reporters attended. In addition to making a written statement, General Zhou answered questions from the reporters as follows:

    Question: Mr. Zhou, you met with Special Envoy Marshall for the second time today. Can you tell us about the content of the meeting?
    Answer: The three parties have agreed not to publish the details separately, so I cannot disclose anything. However, (the following telegram is unclear)
    Question: Regarding the troop reduction and replenishment plan, according to today's Xinmin Daily, the CCP only wants ×× Andong and other areas in the Northeast and is willing to consider other areas; but the CCP cannot consider withdrawing from Rehe and other areas in North China. Is this record accurate?
    Answer: The government has three plans for troop reduction. We can discuss the Northeast part, but the part within the customs goes beyond the scope of troop reduction and becomes a new demand, so we refuse to consider it.
    Question: It is rumored that the meetings of the three-person committee only take place after the opinions of all parties are close, and the meetings are just a formality to pass them. Minister Peng Xuepei also expressed this view. Mr. Zhou said today that the three-person committee may convene tomorrow. Is it possible to reach an agreement?
    Answer: If the meeting can be held tomorrow as hoped, I hope to reach a partial agreement.
    Question: Which part is likely to be achieved first, the restoration of transportation or the troop reduction plan?
    Answer: I am sorry, I cannot disclose these questions.
    Question: I know the content of the Marshall-Zhou talks, and it is inconvenient for Mr. Zhou to announce it separately, but Nanjing's newspapers have already disclosed quite a bit. It is evident that one party has not complied with the agreement, so everyone feels that the news is chaotic and there is no standard information. I would like to ask one thing to clarify this chaotic news, namely, the rumored demands of the government are that the CCP withdraw from the provinces of Chahar and Rehe, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and northern Jiangsu, and that the CCP must withdraw from all nine northeastern provinces in the Northeast, Chahar, and the areas bordering North Korea in the Northeast. Is the rumor correct? If not, what is the truth?
    Answer: I am very impressed with your well-informed sources, and since the Nanjing newspapers are already fully aware, I can confirm that what you said is all true. Precisely because of this, the CCP cannot consider the demands made by the government within the customs, because this exceeds the scope of the troop reduction plan. This demand is tantamount to saying that in the troop reduction, the CCP troops should be driven out of the big cities and railway lines, and scattered and surrounded in small cities and villages, so that they can be eliminated when the opportunity arises. If the CCP were to accept the government's demands, it would mean that the government would achieve its goal through peaceful negotiations; if the CCP refuses this demand, the government will use force to achieve this goal. But we believe that whether by peaceful or forceful means, this goal cannot be achieved, because the liberated people are unwilling to realize this goal of the government.
    Question: Regarding granting Special Envoy Marshall the final arbitration right, the government recently explained it as the right to make a fair judgment. What is the CCP's opinion? To what extent can the CCP concede?
    Answer: The issue of granting the U.S. representative the final decision-making power makes me more and more confused, because the government representative proposed giving the U.S. representative the final decision-making power. Until yesterday, General Xu Yongchang's letter still used this term. Government personnel also used "Finaldecision" in English. Minister Peng of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department and the Central Daily News said that the government's proposal had arbitration rights (Arbitration), saying that the CCP was quibbling. I am clarifying today that in all Chinese and English documents from the government, the term "final decision-making power" is used everywhere. The Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department and the Central Daily News can only be regarded as a propaganda tool or that there might be something wrong with using the words "final decision-making power." At today's press conference hosted by the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, it was announced that the term would be revised. In today's letter from General Xu Yongchang, he also said that it should be revised to "majority vote." This inconsistency and back-and-forth chaos is confusing to me, and I don't know what the government really means. We are very willing to solve the problem in terms of specific methods. We believe that respecting and trusting the U.S. representative is one thing, and giving the U.S. representative the final decision-making power is another, and the two cannot be confused. We are unwilling to change the principle proposed by Special Envoy Marshall in Chongqing that all issues should be agreed upon by the three parties, and we do not agree to leave a final decision-making power to American friends for matters that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party cannot resolve, which would put American friends in a very difficult position, which would create many unpleasant things for all three parties. Therefore, we propose specific methods to give the U.S. representative in the Executive Headquarters the power to solve many difficulties, such as he can directly report to his superiors without the consent of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. For example, the U.S. representative can decide when and where to investigate the conflict in the area under the jurisdiction of the group, thereby... (the following section of code is unclear).
    Question: According to the Ministry of Communications, the CCP is still destroying railways. Is this true?
    Answer: I have not received any news about this recently, and the Ministry of Communications has not notified me. In the past, due to military conflicts, there was some destruction for self-defense. This is very clear. The government used railways, ships, and airplanes to transport troops in large numbers to attack the CCP areas. The CCP can only walk to defend and resist, which shows the great difference in speed. Therefore, when the CCP wants to defend and resist the large-scale offensive of the Kuomintang troops from afar, this has become one of the means of self-defense, but as long as the conflict stops, we fully agree to quickly restore transportation. During the fifteen days of discussion on the restoration of railway transportation, the CCP did not make any new demands. The transportation in the liberated areas where there is no government army attack has never been destroyed, and it is being actively restored. But on the other hand, there are too many railways that have not been repaired in the areas directly controlled by the Kuomintang government, especially south of the Yangtze River. How many railways and how many kilometers of railways have been repaired? The Ministry of Communications will probably answer this question.
    Question: The government has proposed a majority vote method today. What is the CCP's opinion?
    Answer: We just received this proposal and have not yet considered it.
    Question: Can an agreement be reached on the issue of road police in the restoration of transportation?
    Answer: There is no provision for road police in the agreement documents on stopping the conflict and restoring transportation. This is a new topic. Everyone knows that the 15 road police regiments organized by the government are composed of special agents such as the "Loyal and Patriotic Salvation Army" and the Unified Water and Land Transportation Inspection Corps. We cannot agree to let these special agents enter the liberated areas to carry out espionage activities.

　　就国共最近会谈情形
    周恩来同志答记者问
    【新华社南京三十日电】中共代表团周恩来将军于本月二十一日下午七时在京举行中外记者招待会，到记者三十余人，周将军除发表书面谈话外，并答复各记者询问如下：
    问：今日周先生二度会晤马歇尔特使，会谈内容可容见告？
    答：会谈经过三方面曾相约不单独发表，故无可奉告，不过（以下电文不明）
    问：对整军补充方案，据今日新民报载，中共对东北部分只要××安东等地，其他可以考虑；而华北部分退出热河等地，中共不能考虑，此项记载是否正确？
    答：整军问题政府有三个方案，东北部分我们可以讨论，关内部分超出整军范围而成了新的要求，故拒绝考虑。
    问：传闻三人会议开会，都是各方意见已经接近后开会，开会不过加以手续上通过而已，彭学沛部长亦曾有此表示，今周先生说三人会议明日可能召开，是否可能达到协议？
    答：假若明天如能开成会，我希望能达到部分协议。
    问：那一部分可能先有成就，恢复交通并整军方案？
    答：对这些问题恕不能奉告。
    问：我知道马周会谈内容，周先生不便单独宣布，但南京的报纸都已相当有披露，可见必有一方面没有遵守协约，因而大家都感觉消息纷乱，苦无标准之讯息，我想请问一件事，以便澄清这些纷乱消息，即是传闻政府提出的要求，是要中共退出察热两省、烟台、威海卫与苏北，而东北地区中共须退出东北九省全部，察哈尔及东北与朝鲜边境地区，还传闻是否正确？若不正确，那么真相是怎样的？
    答：阁下消息如此灵通，不胜钦佩，而且南京报纸都已全部知悉，我证明先生所说都是事实。正因如此，中共就无法考虑政府所提关内的要求，因为这超过了整军方案的范围，这一要求等于说在整军中，把中共部队赶出大城市及铁道路线，分散包围在小城市及乡村中，以便于时机到来可以消灭他们。假使中共要接受了政府要求，即是政府以和平谈判达到目的；中共如拒绝此要求，政府会用武力来达到此目的。但是我们相信，不论用和平或武力的方式，这一目的是达不到的，因为解放了的人民，不愿实现政府这一目的。
    问：关于给予马歇尔特使最后仲裁权，政府近解释为公断权，中共意见如何？中共能让步到何程度？
    答：给予美方代表最后决定权问题，使我越想越不明白，因政府代表所提是给美方代表以最后决定权。一直到昨天，徐永昌将军来信，仍用此名辞，政府人员用英文写也是用Finaldecision，是国民党中宣部彭部长及中央日报讯所说政府提议有仲裁权（Arbitration），说是中共狡辩。我今天说明，政府方面一切中英文文件中，无处不用最后决定权字样，国民党中宣部与中央日报那样说，只能认为是一种宣传手段，或者认为最后决定权这文字用出了毛病，也未可知。今天国民党中宣部招待记者会上，宣布修改这名辞，徐永昌将军今天来信中，也说要修改，改为多数表决。这种表里不一，前后变乱，我现在感到困扰，且不知政府真意何在。我们方面很愿在具体办法方面来解决，从三人会议到执行小组中间一切困难，我们认为尊重和信任美方代表是一件事，给美国代表以最后决定权是另一件事，不能混为一谈。我们不愿变更马歇尔特使在重庆所提任何问题由三方一致协议后之原则，我们也不赞成使国共双方争论不决的事，留一最后决定权给美国朋友，使美方朋友处于一非常困难地位，这会造成三方面许多不愉快事情。所以我们提出具体办法，使执行小组内美方代表有解决许多困难的职权，譬如他可以直接向上级做报告，不必先经国共两党同意。又譬如美方代表可在该小组管辖区内决定何时何地之调查冲突情形，以此……（以下一段电码不明）。
    问：据交通部讯，中共仍在破坏铁路，是否属实？
    答：最近我未得此项消息，交通部亦未通知。过去由于有军事冲突，为自卫起见，是有过一些破坏情形。这是很清楚的，政府利用铁路、轮船、飞机大量运兵进攻中共地区，中共不论在那一地区，只能用走路来自卫抵抗，这可看出快慢差别之大，所以当中共要自卫抵抗远道而来的国民党大举进攻军队时，这已成为自卫方式之一，但只要冲突一停，我们完全赞成迅速恢复交通。此次十五天谈论关于修复铁路交通一节，中共并未提出任何新的要求，至于没有政府军进攻的解放区交通，从未破坏，而且正积极修复。但另一方面，国民党政府所直接管辖的地区里，没有修复的铁路算起来太多了，特别在长江以南，究竟修复了若干条，若干公里的铁路呢？交通部大概会回答这一问题的。
    问：政府今日提出多数表决权方式，中共方面有何意见？
    答：刚刚收到此一提议，尚未考虑。
    问：恢复交通中的路警问题，能否成立协议？
    答：在停止冲突，恢复交通的协议文件中，本无路警规定，这是新的题目。谁都知道，政府所编组的十五个路警团，是由“忠义救国军”与水陆统一交通检查各总队等特务所组成，将此等特务进入解放区去做特务活动，我们无法同意。
