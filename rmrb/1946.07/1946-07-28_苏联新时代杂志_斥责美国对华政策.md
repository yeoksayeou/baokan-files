Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 25th: Moscow Radio broadcast today: The 14th issue of the "New Times" magazine published an article by Boletani, condemning the US policy towards China. The author pointed out in the article that the US policy towards China is for both economic interests and political, military, and war interests. The US ruling authorities believe that China is one of the main bridges to achieve world domination. From this point of view, the US imperialist group believes that the democratic forces in China are the main obstacle to the actual realization of their plans. This is the basis of the political alliance between the Chinese reactionaries and the powerful groups in the United States. Citing many emergency measures taken by the United States, the author said: The United States seems to be completing Japan's surrender in China, but the facts prove that all these facilities, such as continuing military aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act after the war, transferring a large amount of US military technical equipment to the Chinese government, and submitting a bill to Congress stipulating assistance to China in rearming one million people, have nothing to do with completing the surrender of the Japanese army in China. The facts prove that the US military authorities are consolidating the position of the Chinese reactionary forces in the struggle against the democratic forces. The author concluded: The actions of the US authorities in China cannot but make us think that the United States does not intend to change its policy of interfering in China's internal affairs and has great intentions, which are not only related to the attempt to establish an economic foundation in China, but also to establish a military strategic base, in order to establish US dominance in the Far East. This cannot but arouse the serious concern of peace-loving people.

    斥责美国对华政策
    【新华社延安二十五日电】莫斯科今日广播：新时代杂志第十四期登载波列塔尼一文，斥责美国对华政策。作者在文中特别指出：美国对华政策一方面是为了经济利益，另一方面是为了政治军事战争利益。美国执政当局，认为中国是达到世界统治的主要桥梁之一。美国帝国主义集团，从这种观点看来，认为中国民主势力是实际实现自己计划的主要障碍。这就是中国反动派与美国有势力集团合成政治联盟的基础。作者引据美国所采取的许多紧急措施说：美国似乎是为了完成日本在华投降工作，可是事实证明这一切设施，如在战后仍按租借法案继续军事援华，将大量美国军事技术装备转交中国政府，并在国会提出一项法案，规定帮助中国重新武装一百万人，这些设施与完成在华日军投降工作没有丝毫关系。事实证明，美国军事当局是为了巩固中国反动势力在与民主力量斗争中的地位。作者在结论中说：美国当局在中国的行动，不能不使我们想到美国没有打算改变其干涉中国内政的政策，并且抱有很大的目的，这不仅与企图在中国建立经济基础有关，而且与建立军事战略基地也有联系，以便树立美国在远东的统治。这不能不引起注意和平的人民的严重耽心。
