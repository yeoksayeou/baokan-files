　　[This Dispatch from Handan] Eighteen high-ranking Chiang-Yan officers (seventeen generals, one colonel) who laid down their arms in the Shangdang Campaign held a symposium on the 9th to commemorate the "July 7th" Incident, discussing the current domestic situation. Mr. Zhai Dachang, Major General Counselor of the Second War Zone Headquarters, began by discussing the issue of "orthodoxy," saying: "The Kuomintang government monopolized by Chiang Kai-shek cannot be considered 'orthodox.' Only the joint government representing the will of the people, as advocated by Chairman Mao, is truly 'orthodox.'" He solemnly pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's launching of the civil war was aimed at attempting to usurp the people's orthodoxy. Mr. Dai Shuzhang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Army, used his personal experience to recount the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's passive observation and perverse actions during the War of Resistance against Japan. He believes that the Communist Party played a decisive role in the victory of the War of Resistance, saying: "Japan has surrendered for eleven months, yet Chiang Kai-shek has launched a nationwide anti-people civil war. In order to obtain the help of American imperialist elements, he does not hesitate to act as their son emperor. And the American imperialist elements also attempt to turn China into their colony through these traitors." Mr. Liu Yuanzhou, Major General Chief of Staff of the 69th Division of the 83rd Army, said: "I believe that the Chinese people have sufficient strength to deal a fatal blow to these reactionaries." He emphasized: "We who have laid down our arms have realized the truth, recognized the path, and must resolutely struggle to the end for the New Democracy and New China pointed out by Chairman Mao." Mr. Guo Rong of the 46th Division of the 23rd Army said: "Chiang Kai-shek's fantasy is bound to fail. The Communist Party could not be eliminated in the past ten years of civil war, and it is unimaginable to think of eliminating it today."
　　The five- or six-hour symposium was always tense and enthusiastic, and the whole venue was filled with an atmosphere of yearning for peace and opposing civil war. Finally, it was decided to send a telegram to the whole country, calling for peace and stopping the civil war.

　　[Another Dispatch] The eighteen high-ranking Chiang-Yan officers who laid down their arms in the Shangdang Campaign and advocated peace have jointly telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Mao, and Chairman Zhang of the Democratic League, calling for peace and opposing American armed intervention. They also telegraphed congratulations to Commander Pan of the First Army of the Democratic League for the Haicheng Uprising, and Lieutenant Liu Shanben of the Air Force for withdrawing from the civil war by flying his plane. The telegram calling for peace put forward three urgent appeals: (1) A nationwide long-term truce. (2) The United States should stop military aid to China, reject the arrival of the U.S. military advisory group, and immediately withdraw U.S. naval, land, and air forces stationed in China. (3) Reorganize the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang government, establish a joint government of all parties and factions, democratize politics, and nationalize the army. The congratulatory telegram to the First Army of the Democratic League reads: "Your army bravely raised its arms and launched the Haicheng Uprising. Your benevolence and courage are admirable. We express our deepest admiration and send this telegram to congratulate you." The telegram to Lieutenant Liu Shanben and others reads: "We have just learned that you and your colleagues have flown to Yan'an to withdraw from the civil war and dealt a heavy blow to the reactionaries. We look to you as a guide and are filled with admiration. We respectfully send this telegram to express our congratulations."

　　上党战役放下武器之蒋阎军高级军官
    渴望和平集会座谈时事
    通电全国反对美国军事援蒋内战并电贺潘师和刘善本上尉等义举
    【本报邯郸讯】上党战役中放下武器的十八位蒋阎军高级军官（将官十七人，上校一人）于九日举行纪念“七七”座谈会，讨论目前国内时局。二战区长官部少将参事翟大昌先生首先从“正统”问题谈起，他说：“蒋介石包办的国民政府决不能算‘正统’。只有毛主席所说的代表人民意志的联合政府才是真正的“正统”他郑重指出蒋介石发动内战其目的即为企图篡夺人民的正统。十九军参谋处长戴树章先生，以他亲身经历，痛述抗战期中蒋介石消极观战，倒行逆施的罪恶，他认为抗战胜利，共产党起了决定作用，他说：“日本已投降了十一个月，蒋介石竟又发动全国性的反人民内战，他为了取得美帝国主义分子的帮助，不惜充当人家的儿皇帝。而美帝国主义分子则也企图通过这些卖国贼，把中国变成它的殖民地。”八十三军六十九师少将参谋长刘源洲先生说：“我相信中国人民有充分的力量给这些反动派以致命打击。”他着重的说：“我们这些放下武器的人，已认识到真理，认清了道路，要坚决为毛主席所指出的新民主主义新中国奋斗到底。”二十三军四十六师郭溶先生说：“蒋介石的幻想是一定要失败的，过去十年内战消灭不了共产党，今天还想消灭，是梦想不到的事情。”
    五六个钟头的座谈会始终是紧张而热烈，全场洋溢着渴望和平反对内战的空气，最后并决定通电全国，呼吁和平，制止内战。
