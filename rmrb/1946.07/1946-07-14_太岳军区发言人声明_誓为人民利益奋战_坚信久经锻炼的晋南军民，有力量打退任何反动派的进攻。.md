Statement by the Spokesperson of the Taiyue Military Region
　  Vow to Fight for the Interests of the People
    Firmly Believe that the Well-Trained Soldiers and Civilians of Southern Shanxi Have the Strength to Repel Any Reactionary Attack

    [Our newspaper Yangcheng 12th dispatch] The spokesperson of the Taiyue Military Region recently issued a statement regarding the Kuomintang army's invasion of our Southern Shanxi Liberated Area, stating: During the ceasefire negotiations, the Kuomintang not only consistently rejected our proposal for a long-term and comprehensive ceasefire, but also used the negotiations as a cover to intensify its deployment and preparations for a full-scale civil war. At the beginning of this month, the Kuomintang authorities, on the one hand, under the pressure of the people, agreed to continue ceasefire negotiations and extend the ceasefire order, while on the other hand, they mobilized a large army to launch a large-scale offensive against our Southern Shanxi and Tongpu Railway liberated areas, which further demonstrates their lack of sincerity in ceasefire and their conspiracy to actively expand the civil war. The vast areas along the Tongpu Railway were liberated by our region from the enemy and puppets in recent years; the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area is the base that we have painstakingly built since the Anti-Japanese War to resist the enemy and puppets and protect the people of Southern Shanxi, and the salt ponds of Pinglu, Xiaxian, and Yuncheng were seized back from the enemy and puppets and then occupied by the Kuomintang army. Since the ceasefire, in order to seek peace and unity, our army has always adhered to the agreement and stopped the action to recover the area, while the Kuomintang army has never stopped its offensive, and it has become even more frenzied than before the ceasefire. In May and June, it invaded our Southern Fen Liberated Area with 20,000 troops, and launched a full-scale offensive against our Tongpu Railway line. Now it has launched an offensive against our Southern Shanxi Liberated Area and Pingyao, Huoxian and other places. At present, the Chiang Kai-shek troops that have entered the Southern Shanxi area have reached more than 20,000. And Hu Zongnan's 1st Division and New 2nd Division are gathering in Zhaoyi area west of the Yellow River, and the 61st Division of the 90th Army has also begun to cross the river from Baipo and enter northern Henan. In the past week, the Kuomintang army in Southern Shanxi has occupied the entire line of the Yun (cheng) Mao (jin) Highway, and most of Pinglu, Anyi, Yuncheng, Wenxi, and Xiaxian, and the local masses have suffered unprecedented catastrophe. Yan Xishan also combined with Yang Cheng's puppet troops to occupy Qiliji, Yuebiyuan Temple, Zhaobi, Dongquan in Pingyao and Shangxiawang Village, Shibi, and Guangao in Huoxian, and carried out large-scale arrests, killings and looting. We have protested to the Executive Headquarters against the Kuomintang army's wanton invasion and expansion of the civil war, but to no avail. Our army has no room to retreat, and is now forced to defend itself and fight for the interests of the people in the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area and the Tongpu Railway line. The soldiers and civilians in the Southern Shanxi Liberated Area, who have been battle-tested for a long time, will definitely have the strength to repel any reactionary attack.

　　太岳军区发言人声明
　  誓为人民利益奋战
    坚信久经锻炼的晋南军民，有力量打退任何反动派的进攻。
    【本报阳城十二日电】太岳军区发言人，顷就国民党军向我晋南解放区进犯事发表声明称：在停战谈判中，国民党不仅一贯拒绝我长期全面停战之意见，反以谈判为掩护加紧调动部署，作全面内战之准备。本月初，国民党当局一面在人民压力下，答应继续停战谈判，并延长停战令，一面又调集大军，向我晋南及同蒲沿线解放区大举进攻，于此更可见其毫无停战诚意与积极扩大内战之阴谋。同蒲沿线广大地区，为我区年来从敌伪手中所解放；晋南解放区，系我抗战以来坚苦缔造赖以抗击敌伪保卫晋南人民之基地，且平陆、夏县与运城之盐池，系我从敌伪手中夺回又被国民党军侵占者。停战以来，我军为求和平团结，始终恪守协定，停止恢复该地之行动，而国民党军则从未停止进攻，且较停战以前更加疯狂。五六两月曾以两万大军侵占我汾南解放区，并向我同蒲沿线全面进犯，今则又向我晋南解放区与平遥、霍县等地发动进攻，目前进入晋南地区之蒋军，即达两万余人。而胡宗南系之第一师新二师集结黄河以西之朝邑一带，九十军之六十一师，亦开始自白坡渡河，进入豫北。一周以来，晋南国民党军已侵占我运（城）茅（津）公路全线，及平陆、安邑、运城、闻喜、夏县大部地区，当地群众均遭空前浩劫。阎锡山又结合杨逆城部伪军，侵占我平遥七黎基、岳壁源祠、赵壁、东泉及霍县之上下王村、石毕、广凹等地，大肆捕杀抢掠。国民党军如此肆意进犯扩大内战，我已向执行组提出抗议、迄无效果。我军让无可让退无可退，现已被迫自卫，为保卫晋南解放区及同蒲沿线人民利益而奋战，久经战斗的晋南解放区军民，一定有力量打退任何反动派的进攻。
