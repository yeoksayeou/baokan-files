　　American Imperialists' Ambitions Fully Exposed
    Treating China as if it were the Philippines
    Actually Including China in their Sphere of Influence
    [Report from this newspaper] A map illustrates the position of China in the eyes of the American reactionary group today. The American Wall Street financial group's organ, *Newsweek*, published a map on February 4th this year, dividing the world into three spheres of influence – namely, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Only France and its African colonies were made exceptions, while China was arrogantly designated as a sphere of influence of the United States. This undisguised attitude of Wall Street immediately exposed all the deceptive propaganda of the Chinese reactionaries who have recently been trying to conceal their pro-American behavior, and at the same time gave the Chinese people a strong sense of national humiliation. Mr. Ma Yinchu, a Chinese economist, warned not long ago: "After Japan leaves, the American imperialist faction comes, and China will become a second Philippines." The Chinese Association for Literature and the Arts pointed out in its May 4th declaration: The Chinese people are not willing to follow in the footsteps of India and the Philippines today, changing from a colony of multiple countries to a colony of a single country.

　　美帝国主义分子野心毕露
    视中国若菲律宾
    竟把中国划入其势力范围
    【本报讯】一幅地图说明了在美国反动集团眼中，中国今日处在什么地位？今年二月四日出版的美国华尔街财阀集团机关报——《新闻周刊》登载了一幅地图，把全世界划分三国——即美英苏的势力范围，只有法国及其非洲殖民地被作为例外，而中国则被狂妄划为美国势力范围。华尔街这种毫不掩饰的态度，一下把中国反动派近来掩饰其向美国媚外行为的欺骗宣传全给揭穿，同时给中国人民以一种强烈的国耻的感觉。中国经济学家马寅初先生，不久之前警告称：“去了日本来了美帝国主义派，中国将成为第二个菲律宾。”中华文协总会，则在五月四日的宣言中指出：中国人民不甘心于到了今天还要来步印度、菲律宾的后尘，由多数国的殖民地变为单一国的殖民地。
