General Ye Ting's Poems
    In the past, when General Ye Ting led his troops across the river to the north bank of the Yellow River under government orders, they were ambushed en route. While Commander Ye was in the midst of a long march and arduous battle, hungry and exhausted, he was suddenly inspired to write two lines of an old-style poem:
    "Beauty in the mist, mountains in the clouds, try looking at them as you stand on horseback at the cliff's edge;"
    He urged Mr. Qian Junrui, who was calmly fighting with him, to complete it. Mr. Qian, a scholar who had joined the ranks, encountered this battle. Although he was in a state of great alarm, his poetic inspiration was still not bad. He then continued with two lines:
    "The towering peaks rise three thousand feet, imprisoning a dragon that bursts forth with wings to fly."
      ×            ×              ×                ×
     Ye Ting wrote the following in his cell at Hongluchang, a suburb of Chongqing, on November 14, 1941:
     "The door for people to enter and exit is tightly locked,
    The hole for dogs to crawl out of is wide open,
    A voice shouts loudly:
    ——Crawl out, and you'll have freedom!
    I yearn for freedom, but I also know deeply:
    How can a human body crawl out of a dog's hole!
    I can only wait for the day,
    When the fire from the earth surges up,
    Burning this living coffin and me together,
    I should find eternal peace
    In the flames and hot blood."
                                           Excerpted from *News*, Issue 5

　　叶挺将军的诗
    曩年，叶挺将军率部奉政府命渡江开赴黄河北岸之际，半途遭逢袭击，当叶军长于长行军与艰苦作战之俄顷，又饿又累之余，忽诗与勃发，书旧体诗两句：
    “雾里美人云里山，临崖立马君试看；”
    促其一同沉着困战的钱俊瑞先生为之续成。钱先生书生参入兵列，即逢是役，虽惊危万状，诗兴尚不恶。即续咏两句：
    “层峰直上三千尺，出押蛟龙插翅飞。”
      ×            ×              ×                ×
     叶挺三十一年十一月十四日在渝郊红炉厂囚室中写道：
     “为人进出的门紧锁着，
    为狗爬出的洞敞开着，
    一个声音高叫着：
    ——爬出来呵，给你自由！
    我渴望着自由，但也深知道：
    人的身体那能由狗的洞子爬出！
    我只能期待着，那一天，
    地下的火冲腾，
    把这活棺材和我一齐烧掉，
    我应该在烈火和热血中，
    得到永安。”
