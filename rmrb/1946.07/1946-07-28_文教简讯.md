　　Cultural and Educational Briefs
　　Northern University, in order to strengthen its cultural and recreational propaganda work, previously organized a Peking Opera Research Society, which performed "The Tercentenary of the Year of Jia Shen" at the China Grand Theater in Xingtai City, achieving good results. Around the "July 7th" anniversary, they also staged the famous play "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels". Recently, in order to adapt to the current widespread mass emancipation movement, they have organized an Emancipation Drama Society, which is actively rushing to stage the opera "The White-Haired Girl", which is expected to be completed by the end of the month. At that time, both drama societies will go to the countryside for touring performances, in order to universally enlighten the masses. With the active activities of these two drama societies, Northern University's cultural and recreational work is bound to have amazing results in the future.

　　The Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region is rushing to stage the drama "The Battle of Mafang". This is a major creation reflecting the life of the troops after "Two Kinds of Work Style". It is reported that Jiang Tao and Shi Chao visited many commanders, cadres, and soldiers before the creation, and it took more than 20 days just to collect materials.

　　The Handan Public Education Center has been exhibiting the life of the people in the liberated areas since the 11th, with content covering war, production, education, and mass movements. The most eye-catching among them is the photograph of Chairman Mao's warm welcome at the airport when he went to Chongqing for peace talks. Another photograph of Chairman Mao talking with Wu Manyou fully expresses the close relationship between the great people's leader and the labor hero. The tragic scene of the Kuomintang planes' unreasonable bombing of the peaceful residents harvesting wheat in Yongnian aroused great anger among the audience. The masses in this city pointed at the photo of the struggle against the traitor Lu Wan, with excited smiles after their emancipation. A total of more than 100 films of various types were shown, and the audience was extremely enthusiastic.
　　The Handan Theater has been packed every day since its premiere on the 28th of last month. On the 11th, the theater's income reached more than 60,000 yuan. The People's Theater is also very crowded.
