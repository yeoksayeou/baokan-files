Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Warsaw dispatch: It is learned here that 100,000 troops of the Polish fascist exiled army – Anders' Army – have recently been transported back to Britain by the British authorities, merged with the British army, renamed the "Polish Colonization Corps," and still maintain the characteristics of the Polish army in their appearance and internal structure. This move by Britain has aroused widespread indignation among the Polish people. The Warsaw newspaper *Głos Ludu* commented on the matter, saying: The British government's attempt to preserve Anders' army for a long time violates the promise to allow the responsible parties to dissolve the Polish fascist exiled troops. The newspaper, analyzing the situation and Anders' statements, stated: Anders' preservation of the army is tantamount to preserving it as a center for preparing for a Polish civil war. According to the total number of Polish exiled troops, which amounts to 500,000, three-fifths are currently in the British-occupied zone in Germany. 50,000 are in Britain. The 100,000 Anders' troops were originally stationed in the Adriatic border area of Italy.

　　英国当局别有用心
    运回波法西斯流亡军十万
    【新华社延安十四日电】华沙讯：此间获悉波兰法西斯流亡军队——安德斯部队十万人，最近由英国当局运回英国，与英军合并，易名为“波兰垦殖兵团”，并在其外形与内部仍保持波兰军队的特点。英国此举，引起波兰人民的广大义愤。华沙《哥鲁斯拉德报》评论此事称：英国政府企图长期保存安德斯军队之行为，违背允许负责解散波兰法西斯流亡部队的约言。该报于分析形势及安德斯的声明称：安德斯保存军队，就等于保留其作为准备波兰内战的中心。按波兰流亡军队总数计达五十万，其中五分之三，现在德境英国占领区内。五万在英国。十万安德斯部队，原驻意大利亚得里亚边境一带。
