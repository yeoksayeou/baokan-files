　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Nanjing dispatch: The CCP delegation in Nanjing proposed to the Nationalist Party representatives on the 11th that the Chinese delegation attending the Paris Peace Conference, which is to open on the 29th of this month, should include a certain number of CCP representatives. The CCP representatives announced that their reason was: China currently does not have a democratic coalition government that can represent the entire people. The current Nationalist government can only represent the most unpopular faction of a single party in China, while the CCP can at least represent the 140 million people in the Chinese liberated areas, who made the most significant contributions in the anti-fascist war, accounting for one-third of the country's total population. The CCP representatives stated: In order to prevent the Chinese delegation attending the conference from being merely a delegation of an "evil government" and to somewhat salvage China's international standing, which has been lowered due to dictatorial civil war, the CCP's participation in the delegation is truly necessary for the nation's honor. It is noted that the Chinese delegation to the San Francisco United Nations Conference from April to June 1945 was composed of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the Democratic League. However, the CCP requested three representative positions, but the stubborn authorities of the Kuomintang only allowed Mr. Dong Biwu to participate.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Beiping dispatch: Renowned professors Chen Jinkun and educator Fu Zhaiyi jointly cabled the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference, appealing for a halt to the Chinese civil war. The original cable is as follows:

    Most urgent, to the esteemed Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference:
    The Chinese government is expanding the civil war, cruelly oppressing the people, causing widespread death and suffering, with millions affected in a single province. This is completely contrary to the statement made at the Moscow Conference last year by the three foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. We earnestly request that you urgently telegraph Special Envoy Marshall to effectively stop this civil war and instruct the Nationalist government to open up the government and resolve disputes through the Political Consultative Conference. We hereby appeal, and earnestly hope that you will adopt it. Fu Zhaiyi, Chen Jinkun.

　　我驻京代表团向国方提出中共应出席巴黎和会
    北平名教授电外长会议制止蒋介石内战
    【新华社延安十八日电】南京讯：中共驻南京代表团，已于十一日向国民党代表提出，中国出席本月二十九日开幕的巴黎和会的代表团，应包括一定数目的中共代表。中共代表宣布其理由是：中国现尚无足以代表全国人民的民主联合政府，现在的国民政府只能代表中国一个政党中的最不受欢迎的一派，而中共则至少可以代表在反法西斯战争中功绩最著的中国解放区的一万万四千万人民，即占全国总人口三分之一。中共代表称：为了使出席和会的中国代表团不仅仅是一个“恶政府”的代表团，而多少挽救中国已因独裁内战而降低的国际地位，则中共的参加代表团，实为国家荣誉所必需。按一九四五年四月至六月，旧金山联合国会议的中国代表团，系由国民党、共产党、民主同盟所组成，可是中共要求有三个代表的位置，但国民党的顽固当局仅允许董必武氏一人参加。
    【新华社延安十八日电】北平讯：此间名教授陈瑾昆及教育家符宅一两氏，联名致电巴黎外长会议，呼吁制止中国内战，原电如下：
    万急，巴黎外长会议钧鉴：
    中国政府正扩大内战，残民以逞，人民死亡枕籍，一省达数百万，此与去岁英美苏三外长会议在莫斯科会议声明完全相反。为特恳请贵处，电促马歇尔特使切实制止此项内战，并责成国民政府开放政权，仍由政协会议解决纷争，特此呼吁，万祈采纳。符宅一、陈瑾昆。
