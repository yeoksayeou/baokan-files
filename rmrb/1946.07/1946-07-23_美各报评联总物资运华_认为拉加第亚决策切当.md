　　American Newspapers Comment on UNRRA Supplies to China
    Believing LaGuardia's Decision Was Appropriate
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: According to the U.S. Information Service: American newspapers commented on LaGuardia's decision to suspend the shipment of UNRRA relief supplies to China. The Dallas Morning News stated in an editorial on the 12th: The United States urgently needs a far-reaching China policy, and LaGuardia's decision is indeed very appropriate. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch argued on the same day: "This move by UNRRA is sufficient to show that the Central Government (referring to the Kuomintang government) itself should strive for democratization."
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Associated Press, Shanghai dispatch: Despite the Kuomintang representatives' insistence on dissenting opinions, the UNRRA Far East Committee still passed a report from a subcommittee, which "will be submitted to the UNRRA conference to be held in Geneva," firmly stating: Although various efforts have been made, UNRRA supplies have still not been fairly distributed to the Chinese Communist areas, but the committee still hopes that LaGuardia's order to suspend the shipment of supplies to China will be quickly rescinded, and it is recommended that the time for shipping relief supplies to China be extended by three months, until June 30th next year, and urges the Executive Headquarters to extend it until New Year's Eve next year. Representatives from ten countries, including Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Austria, attended the committee meeting.

　　美各报评联总物资运华
    认为拉加第亚决策切当
    【新华社延安十八日电】据美国新闻处息：美国报纸评拉加第亚停运联总救济物资至中国之决策。道拉斯报十二日社论称：美国极需一远大之对华政策，拉加第亚之决策，诚极切当。圣路明斯邮报同日著论谓：“联总此举，适足显示中央政府（按指国民党政府）自身应力求民主化”。
    【新华社延安十八日电】美联社沪讯：尽管国民党代表坚持不同意见，但联总远东委员会仍通过了小组委员会的一个报告，这一报告“将提交行将在日内瓦举行的联总会议”，坚称：虽然作了种种努力，联总供应品仍未能公平分配到中国共产党地区，但该会仍望拉加第亚迅速停运物资来华之命令，并建议将教济物资运华时间延长三月，至明年六月三十日为止，并敦促行总延长至明年除夕。出席委员会者有英、美、苏、奥等十国代表。
