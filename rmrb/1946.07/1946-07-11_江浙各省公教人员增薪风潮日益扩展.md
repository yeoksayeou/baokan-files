　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th. Since the Kuomintang authorities announced adjustments to the compensation standards for public employees and teachers at the beginning of last month, the wave of salary increase demands by public employees and teachers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces has continued to develop. Public employees and teachers in Jiangsu generally believe that prices in Jiangsu are no lower than those in Shanghai, but the authorities stipulated that the base figure for Jiangsu is one-third lower than that of Shanghai, leading to widespread opposition. Middle school teachers and staff throughout the province have been on strike since the 17th of last month. Civil servants in central government agencies in Zhenjiang City have also jointly requested reasonable salary increases, and have decided to collectively "resign" if a satisfactory response is not received. All staff members of the Anhui Provincial Government, feeling that their monthly income is insufficient to provide even basic sustenance, have sent representatives to demand that the authorities promptly find ways to increase their salaries, otherwise they will take forceful action. Employees of other agencies, such as the Anhui Branch of the High Court, the Salt Affairs Bureau Branch, the Goods Tax Bureau Branch, the Direct Tax Bureau Branch, and the Huai River Rehabilitation Engineering Bureau, as well as teachers in various primary and secondary schools, have unanimously demanded salary increases from the authorities, and have stated that they will resign if no response is received. Faculty and staff at Zhejiang University, Ningbo Middle School, Xiangshan, Shipu Elementary School, and other schools have successively gone on strike since the 10th of last month, joining this wave.

　　江浙各省公教人员增薪风潮日益扩展
    【新华社延安七日电】自国民党当局上月初公布调整公教人员待遇标准后，苏、浙、皖各省公教人员要求增薪的风潮，仍继续发展，江苏公教人员一致认为江苏物价并不低于上海，但当局却规定江苏的基数较上海低三分之一，致纷起反对，全省中学教职员已于上月十七日起，全体罢教。镇江市中央机关公务人员亦联名要求合理增薪，并决定如无圆满答复，则全体“请辞”。安徽省府全体职员，以每月收入不及一饱，乃推派代表要求当局迅予设法增薪，否则采取有力之行动。其他各机关如高一分院、盐务分局、货务税分局、直接税分局、淮河复埠工程局等员工及各中小学教师，一致要求当局增薪，并声言如不答复，即挂冠而去。浙大、宁波中学、象山、石浦小学等教职员，均于上月十日起，相继罢教，卷入这一风潮。
