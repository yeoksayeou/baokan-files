　　Severe Food Shortage in Southeast Asia
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th] The food shortage in Southeast Asia is extremely severe. According to a Reuters dispatch from Singapore: The office of Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia, Killearn, issued a statement on the 11th at the close of the conference of liaison officers in Southeast Asian territories, stating: The food situation in Hong Kong is more serious than ever before, and the supply of rice and flour is nearly exhausted. The conference confirmed that a very serious situation is spreading across grain-deficient countries. The representative from Ceylon told the conference that the supply of rice from Egypt and Brazil is very irregular, and if grain ships do not arrive on schedule, Ceylon will be unable to maintain its current low level of food supply. He said: "Ceylon's flour will be exhausted in the near future, which poses a very serious danger to Ceylon." The Federation of Malaya and Singapore also rely on imported food for their sustenance. Although Burma has made great efforts to export grain, the destruction of port facilities by the war and the current monsoon season have limited export work. Moreover, Burma has very little surplus grain, as the wounds of the war have not yet healed.

　　东南亚粮荒严重
    【新华社延安十三日电】东南亚粮荒极为严重。据路透社新加坡电：东南亚专员基伦办公厅，十一日在东南亚领土联络官会议闭幕时发表声明谓：香港的粮食情况较前任何时候都严重，大米与面粉的供应已近耗竭。会议证明十分严重的情况，正弥漫于缺粮各国。锡兰代表告大会称：来自埃及与巴西的大米，供应极不经常，倘无粮船按期开到，锡兰将无法维持目前低度的粮食情况。他说：“锡兰的面粉在最近将来即告罄尽，这对锡兰具有非常严重的危险”。马来亚联邦与新加坡亦是靠外来粮食生活的。缅甸输出粮食虽尽了很大努力，但海港设备受战争破坏及目前季候风的影响，使输出工作受到限制。且缅甸余粮为数甚少，因战争之创伤尚未恢复。
