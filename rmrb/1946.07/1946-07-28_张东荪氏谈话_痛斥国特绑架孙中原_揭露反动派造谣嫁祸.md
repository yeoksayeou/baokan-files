Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 25th: Beiping Dispatch: Mr. Zhang Dongsun,负责人 of the China Democratic League's North China General Branch, recently issued a statement regarding the kidnapping of Mr. Sun Zhongyuan of the League's Beiping General Branch by Kuomintang agents on the 18th, stating: "The arrest of Mr. Sun Zhongyuan, following the successive assassinations of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, is a planned action by Kuomintang agents. Such atrocities make scholars and professors feel threatened, which is not the phenomenon that China should have today. However, such unfortunate events have occurred repeatedly recently, which shows that the issue now is no longer about peace but about humanity. If one is human, shouldn't one still talk about some principles and credibility!?" After Mr. Sun was kidnapped, Kuomintang newspapers in Beiping vigorously spread rumors, saying that this was done by the CCP. Mr. Zhang solemnly stated in response that he strongly condemned such vile words from the Kuomintang reactionaries, which were intended to shift the blame onto others and sow discord, and were tantamount to confessing their own actions. According to reports, after Mr. Sun was arrested, the North China Democratic League immediately lodged a serious protest with the Beiping municipal authorities, demanding his immediate release, but his whereabouts remain unknown. It is generally believed that Mr. Sun's life is in grave danger.

　　张东荪氏谈话
    痛斥国特绑架孙中原
    揭露反动派造谣嫁祸
    【新华社延安二十五日电】北平讯：民盟华北总支部负责人张东荪氏，顷就该盟北平总支部孙中原氏十八日被国民党特务绑去事件发表谈话称：“孙中原氏之被捕与李公朴、闻一多二氏之先后被杀，是国民党特务有计划的行动。如此暴行使学者教授人人自危，实非中国今日应有的现象。但是近竟屡次发生此种不幸事件，这说明现在已经不是和平问题而是人性问题，如果是人，是不是还应讲些信义！？”孙氏被绑后，北平国民党报纸曾大肆造谣说，此为中共所为。张氏对此特郑重声明，痛斥国民党反动派此种卑鄙之言，实为嫁祸于人，并有挑拨离间行为，同时无异自供自己所为。按孙氏被捕后，华北民盟即向北平市当局提出严重抗议，要求立即释放，但迄今仍无下落。一般咸认孙氏生命已凶多吉少。
