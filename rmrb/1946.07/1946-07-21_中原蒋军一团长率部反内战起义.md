　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 16th (delayed dispatch) The commander of the 39th Regiment of the New 11th Division of the 12th Army of Chiang Kai-shek's forces, which was "encircling and annihilating" our Central Plains Liberated Area, refused to carry out the attack order during a battle with Li Xiannian's troops near Xuanhuadian on the 3rd of this month. He automatically abandoned his position and led some of his soldiers to join our army. According to several soldiers who laid down their weapons, dissatisfaction with Chiang Kai-shek and his senior commanders is gradually growing among Chiang's soldiers and lower and middle-ranking officers. It is said that the food supply for Chiang's army is extremely poor, sometimes only one meal a day. Senior officers eager for civil war often issue orders for forced marches without rest. Soldiers and lower and middle-ranking officers are punished, beaten, and scolded for the slightest disagreement with their superiors. Even some army commanders and division commanders have been punished by Chiang Kai-shek, Cheng Qian, and Liu Zhi for failing to complete Chiang Kai-shek's "total annihilation" plan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th Dispatch from Hankou: Colonel Xue Zizheng, the Communist representative of the Ninth Group of the Executive Headquarters in Hankou, and Lieutenant Colonel Ren Shishun, the Communist representative of the Thirty-second Group, arrived in Hankou from Nanjing on the 11th, accompanied by the American representatives of the two groups. The Communist representatives stated that the Communist Party demanded that Li Xiannian's troops peacefully withdraw to the North China Liberated Area. Chiang's side has no reason to refuse this request. For the sake of mediation, Chiang's army must first stop the so-called "pursuit," "blocking," "encirclement," and "suppression." Only in this way can mediation be discussed and contact with Li Xiannian's troops be possible. This opinion was agreed to by General Marshall in Nanjing. However, Chiang's side in Hankou insisted on Chiang Kai-shek's annihilation plan and refused to stop pursuing and blocking, which led to the expansion of the Central Plains war and the further distance of Li's troops, making it impossible to establish any contact with the groups to this day.

　　中原蒋军一团长率部反内战起义
    【新华社中原某地十六日电】（迟到）“围歼”我中原解放区蒋介石之十二军新十一师三十九团团长，本月三日在宣化店附近与李先念部作战时，拒绝执行进攻命令，自动放弃阵地，并率士兵一部投入我军。据若干放下武器的士兵说：在蒋军士兵及中下级军官中，正逐渐滋长对蒋介石及其高级指挥官的不满情绪。据谈：蒋军粮食供应情况极坏，甚至有时一天只能吃到一顿饭，而内战心切的高级军官，经常通令强行军，从未得到休息，士兵及中下级军官稍有不合长官意志者，即被责罚打骂，甚至若干军长、师长亦因未能完成蒋介石的“全部歼灭”计划而受到蒋介石、程潜、刘峙等人的处分。
    【新华社延安十四日电】汉口讯：执行部汉口第九小组中共代表薛子正上校，与第三十二小组中共代表任士舜中校，已于十一日偕两小组美方代表，由南京来汉口。中共代表称：中共要求李先念部和平撤往华北解放区，此要求蒋方实无任何理由可以拒绝，现为调处计，首须蒋军停止所谓“追击”、“堵击”、“围剿”、“清剿”，必如此才能谈到调处，也才有与李先念部取得联络的可能。此项意见，在京时已得马歇尔将军的同意，但汉口蒋方坚持蒋介石的围歼计划，拒绝停追停堵，致中原战事日趋扩大，而李部亦愈追愈远，迄今无法与小组取得任何联络。
