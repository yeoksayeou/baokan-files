　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Moscow dispatch: Georgiev wrote in Izvestia: After the end of the war, the United States has not abandoned its leadership of military and political blocs in the Western Hemisphere. Judging from all indications, the United States is trying to work more stubbornly towards this goal. According to New York newspapers, this issue will be the subject of discussion at the Pan-American Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil. The preparations for this conference, especially President Truman's bill proposed in his message to Congress in early May regarding Pan-American military cooperation, have attracted special attention. In addition to other issues, this bill stipulates the organization of military institutions, training methods, and equipment for the Americas. Public opinion in Latin American countries regards this bill as a serious threat to the independence of Western Hemisphere countries.
