Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 26th. The British Communist Party's request to join the Labour Party has received enthusiastic support from all levels of the British working class, creating a broad mass movement. On April 1st, the British Communist Party published a communiqué on "merger" entitled "The First 'Thousand'," detailing records of influence with one thousand and fifteen trade unions in various regions and departments, as well as one hundred and seventy workers' leaders who have a significant impact on the British workers' movement, and eight national workers' organizations. These trade union leaders include lifelong servants of the workers' movement such as ·Tanner (Chairman of the Amalgamated Engineering Union), W.K. Lawther (President of the National Union of Mineworkers), A. Horner (President of the South Wales Miners' Federation), and eight national workers' organizations, including the Amalgamated Engineering Union with over 900,000 members, the National Union of Mineworkers with 700,000 members, the Electrical Trades Union with 130,000 members, and the Fire Brigades Union which established a mixed trade union alliance. The one thousand and fifteen trade unions include eight trade union executive committees, sixteen trade union district or regional committees, eight hundred and thirteen trade union branches, seventeen Labour Party district party branches, forty-eight Labour Party local party branches, six workers and Labour Party affairs councils, twenty-eight industrial trade councils, twelve factory representative conferences, and twenty-five cooperative organizations. These one thousand and fifteen trade unions or Labour Party organizations include countless masses of workers. The British Communist Party pointed out in the communiqué: "Undoubtedly, the actual number is much larger than this, because many local organizations have not yet notified the British Communist Party of their decision."

　　The British Communist Party continued in the communiqué: The millions upon millions of people who support the British Communist Party joining the Labour Party are unwilling to see the Labour Party's unreasonable refusal. They want to break down all artificial obstacles and continue to crush the local or national resistance of the Conservative Party, so that the working class can share more of the fruits of victory for which they fought and sacrificed.

　　Unfortunately, the British Communist Party's request to join the Labour Party was rejected at the Labour Party's Portsmouth Conference held in June this year. Of course, the majority of trade union members and workers have not joined the Labour Party, and their wishes cannot be expressed at the Labour Party annual conference. But more importantly, there are many obstacles from stubborn factions in the Labour Party leadership. They regard the unity of the working class as a venomous snake, and try their best to sabotage it. Morrison (the current Lord President of the Council) is one of the most active among them. At the Labour Party Congress, a new party constitution was also passed that is absolutely not in the interests of the working class. According to this party constitution, the Labour Party is only a single political party, and not a coalition of various political groups of the working class as it was in the past.

　　Even so, the movement for unity among British workers is in full swing, and they will insist on expanding the request for the British Communist Party to join the Labour Party. The British Communist Party pointed out in the conclusion of its communiqué that they will strengthen this movement to achieve another thousand resolutions supporting the Communist Party joining the Labour Party.

### 英共加入工党提议  全英工人热烈拥护

　　英共加入工党提议
    全英工人热烈拥护
    【新华社延安二十六日电】英国共产党加入工党的要求，在英国工人阶级的各阶层中得到热烈的拥护，造成了广泛的群众运动。英共于四月一日发表关于“合并”的公报，题为“第一个‘一千’”，详载与各个区域、各个部门的一千零十五个职工会，以及一百七十位在英国工人运动中有重大影响的工人领袖，和八个全国性的工人团体影响的记录。这些职工领袖，包括终身为工人运动服务的·唐得（机器工会联合会主席）、Ｗ·Ｋ·劳瑟（全国矿工联盟主席）、Ａ·霍恩勒（南威尔士矿工联盟主席）等八个全国性的工人团体，包括拥有会员九十余万人的机器工会联合会，拥有会员七十万人的全国矿工联盟，拥有会员十三万人的电气职工联盟，以及建立职工混合联盟救火会联盟等。在一千零十五个职工会中，包括八个职工会执行委员会，十六个职工会区或区域委员会，八百十三个职工会支部，十七个工党区党部，四十八个工党地方党部，六个各业工人与工党事理会，二十八个各业职工理事会，十二个工厂代表会议，以及二十五个合作社组织等。在这一千零十五个职工会或工党组织中，包括了无数万的广大工人群众。英共在公报中指出：“无疑的，实际数字比这个数字大的多，因为有许多地方组织尚未将其决定通知英共”。
    英共在公报中继称：拥护英共加入工党的千千万万的人们，不愿看到工党的无理拒绝，他们要打破一切人为的障碍，继续粉碎保守党的地方性或全国性的抵抗，以便使工人阶级能多分享他们曾为之战斗与牺牲的胜利果实。
    不幸的是英共加入工党的要求，于今年六月举行的工党朴茨茅斯大会上被否决。当然，大部分的职工会员与工人都没有加入工党，他们的愿望不能在工党年会上表达出来。但是更重要的，还在于工党领导机关中顽固派的多方阻挠，他们把工人阶级的团结一致视为蛇蝎，极力从中破坏，摩利逊（现任枢密院大臣）便是其中最积极的一个。工党大会上，还通过了绝对不合工人阶级利益的新的党章，根据这一党章，工党只是一个单一的政党，而不是和它过去一样是一个工人阶级各政治集团的联盟。
    虽然如此，英国工人要求团结的运动正方兴未艾，他们将坚持扩大英共加入工党的要求。英共在其公报的结语中指出，他们将加强这一运动，以达到另外一千个支援共产党加入工党的决议。
