Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd. Tokyo dispatch: The Allied Council for Japan will convene on the 24th. Most observers here predict that at that time, there will be another fierce debate between the United States and the Soviet Union over the issue of confiscating books from Japanese fascists, militarists, and anti-Allied sources. This proposal was put forward by Soviet representative General Derevyanko, because such books detrimental to the cause of world peace can still be bought in Japanese schools and bookstores. At the previous council meeting, although the general representatives agreed with the Soviet Union's opinion, it was opposed by US representative Atcheson. At the upcoming meeting, the above agenda item is listed as item four on the agenda. The first three items are: (1) MacArthur's proposed maritime inspection issue, (2) the Soviet Union's proposed discussion of the "Japanese Committee for Investigating the Causes of Japan's Aggression and Defeat" issue, (3) the Soviet Union's proposed discussion of the "Compensation from the Japanese Government to Military Industries" issue.

　　对日委会行将召开
    【新华社延安二十二日电】东京讯：盟国对日委员会二十四日将开会。此间多数观察家预料，届时美对苏之间没收日本法西斯军国主义及反盟的书籍问题，势将又有一番激烈争论。这建议为苏联代表德勒扬哥将军所提，因目前日本学校尚能在书店买到此类不利世界和平事业的书籍。在前次委员会开会时，虽然一般代表均同意苏联的意见，但却为美代表艾契森反对。在行将举行的会议上，上项议程被列入议事程序之第四项，前三项为：（１）麦克阿瑟提出的海上检查问题，（２）苏联提出的讨论“调查日本启衅及战败原因的日本委员会”问题，（３）苏联提出的讨论“日政府给军事工业的补偿”问题。
