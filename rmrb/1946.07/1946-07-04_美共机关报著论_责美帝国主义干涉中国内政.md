    U.S. Communist Party Organ Publishes Article
    Accusing U.S. Imperialism of Interfering in China's Internal Affairs

    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] The U.S. Communist Party's organ, the Daily Worker, published an editorial on May 25th, condemning U.S. imperialist elements for interfering in China's internal affairs, stating in part: "American interference not only continues to prolong the Chinese civil war, divides the anti-fascist forces, and hinders the completion of China's democratic unity, but also tramples on China's national sovereignty. The U.S. Department of the Army and the State Department are fanatically carrying out such attempts, fantasizing about turning China, one of the allies, into a base for war criminals to confront another ally, the Soviet Union. And the Kuomintang's dictatorial regime is a tool of U.S. imperialist policy." The newspaper stated: "With genuine understanding and self-sacrifice, the Communist Party has made significant concessions to the Kuomintang in the proposed coalition government and in the constitutional drafting conference. The ratio of Communist troops to Kuomintang troops after the reorganization and unification of the national army is one to five. This concession is only in the hope that the Kuomintang will end one-party dictatorship, accept the democratic principles of the new constitution, and immediately stop the evil trend of war criminals." The newspaper pointed out: "The Kuomintang government has broken all these agreements, proving the Kuomintang's lack of sincerity. In these developments, the U.S. government continues to aid the Kuomintang government with loans and supplies. The fact that American money, cannons, airplanes, bombs, and tens of thousands of shells are needed to destroy the towns and cities of the Northeast proves that the Kuomintang is a fascist dictatorial government. This government has openly colluded with the Japanese puppets since the day the Japanese invaders surrendered, opening fire on its own people." The newspaper called on the American people "not to allow imperialist elements to interfere in China's sovereignty again, not to aid China's civil war and obstruct China's democratic movement. We cannot tolerate the imperialist elements' conspiracy to use China and the Northeast as a base for anti-Soviet war. We should firmly demand that the U.S. government cancel all interference actions so that the Chinese people can solve their internal problems in a democratic way."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st] According to a United Press report from Shanghai on the 30th: To prevent the anti-civil war demonstration planned by the people of Shanghai for Sunday morning (i.e., the 30th), the U.S. Army in Shanghai has stepped up "guarding" and security. Military police were all armed with bayonets and fortifications were set up. Military personnel were prohibited from going out, but the demonstration was not held that day. The Navy is still continuing "guarding" operations.

　　美共机关报著论
    责美帝国主义干涉中国内政
    【新华社延安一日电】美共机关报工人日报五月二十五日社论，谴责美帝国主义分子干涉中国内政，略谓：“美国的干涉，不仅继续延长了中国内战，分裂了反法西斯独裁势力，阻碍了中国民主团结的完成，而且蹂躏中国民族的主权，美国陆军部、国务院狂热的执行着这样的企图，幻想把盟友之一的中国变成战犯的根据地，以对抗另一盟友苏联。而国民党的独裁政权，则是美帝国主义政策的工具”。该报称：“共产党以真正的谅解和自我牺牲精神在拟议中的联合政府内，在宪草会议内，向国民党作了重大让步，整编统一后的国军，共产党军与国民党军的比例是一比五，这种让步，只是愿望国民党结束一党专政，接受新宪法的民主原则，立即制止万恶的战犯趋向”。该报指出：“国民党政府破坏了所有这些协议，证明国民党缺乏诚意，而在这些发展中，美国政府却以贷款和物资继续援助国民党政府。需要美国的金钱大炮飞机炸弹和成千成万的炮弹，来毁灭东北的城镇，这证明国民党是一个法西斯独裁政府。这个政府自日寇投降之日起，即公开和日伪勾结，向自己人民开火”。该报呼吁美国人民“不要让帝国主义分子再干涉中国主权，不要援助中国的内战和阻扰中国的民主运动。我们不能容忍帝国主义分子利用中国和东北来作为反苏战争根据地的阴谋，我们应该坚决要求美国政府取消一切干涉行动，以便中国人民能够用民主的方式来解决其内部问题”。
    【新华社延安一日电】据合众社上海三十日电：为预防星期日（按即三十日）晨上海人民拟举行之反内战游行示威，上海美陆军严加“警卫”，军事警察皆上刺刀，并设置工事，军事人员俱禁止外出，但是日并未举行示威，现海军仍在继续“警卫”中。
