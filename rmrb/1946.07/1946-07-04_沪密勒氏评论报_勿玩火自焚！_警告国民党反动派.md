Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 1st: Shanghai dispatch: The *China Weekly Review*, an American-run publication in Shanghai, in its editorial titled "United as One" on June 15th, rebuked the Kuomintang authorities, warning them not to play with the fire of civil war. The article pointed out that although the Kuomintang authorities' "desire for peaceful compromise" is not high at present, they must pay attention to the following points: (1) It is out of the question now, or in the next few years, to completely eliminate communism. If the Chinese Red Army was still in its infancy during the "bandit suppression wars" of more than ten years, and the Chinese Kuomintang could not eliminate them then, what hope can they harbor today to end the rule of Yan'an? Similarly, if the Japanese, with more favorable conditions, could not succeed in attacking the Communist Party, what hope does Nanjing have? (2) Occupying the cities does not mean occupying everything... Moreover, no matter how many cities the Kuomintang takes, if there is no permanent solution, the Communist Party will always rule the surrounding countryside. (3) The continuation of the civil war is more beneficial to the Communist Party than to the Kuomintang. In times of relative peace and prosperity, China's calm farmers (now accounting for about 90% of the population) are almost indifferent to any rule. However, in a prolonged conflict, coupled with famine and the sacrifice of lives, a great wave of revolutionary sentiment will inevitably arise. The longer the civil war lasts, the more people will lean towards Yan'an. The facts of the past few months have proven this point. Peace and prosperity can bring calm to the masses. (4) The more intense the civil war continues, the greater the temptation to turn China into a second or larger Spain. Of course, in a prolonged struggle, the Kuomintang is by no means the only one who can receive foreign aid. Until now, the Communist Party has received very little foreign aid compared to the assistance the Kuomintang has received, but can this continue for long? These are all unpleasant facts that the Kuomintang must consider. Indeed, they are in a worse position than they were at the end of the war, and even more disadvantageous than they were on July 7, 1937. Nanjing will certainly not like this conclusion, but it corresponds to the truth.

On June 14th, the Shanghai *China Press* editorial, "Moving Towards the Light," issued the same warning to the Kuomintang authorities. The article pointed out: "Some people in the National Government are planning to launch a full-scale civil war and are obtaining the support of some foreigners, but when the Kuomintang authorities' civil war plan is realized, they will inevitably encounter serious difficulties and dangers. Conversely, the Communist Party will have the same advantages that the entire Chinese nation had when resisting Japan. "The Communist Party will receive the support of the countryside in many areas, which its opponents do not have." Therefore, the article called on the Kuomintang authorities to abandon their civil war policy and establish a coalition government by peaceful means. The article said: "Undoubtedly, this will benefit the nation, and in a government with the participation of multiple parties, we can foresee that each party can seek opportunities for development through democratic methods."

　　沪密勒氏评论报
    勿玩火自焚！
    警告国民党反动派
    【新华社南京一日电】沪讯：上海美国所办的密勒氏评论报在六月十五日题为《合众为一》的社论中，斥责国民党当局不要玩内战之火，该文指出：国民党当局现在“对于和平妥协的欲望”虽然不高，但是他们必须注意以下几点：（一）现在或者最近几年中，要完全消灭共产主义是谈也不要谈的，如果经过十几年的“剿匪战争”，当时中国红军还在幼年时代，而中国国民党都不能消灭他们，那么他们今天还能怀什么希望结束延安的统治呢？同样，如果条件更有利的日本人，打击共产党都不能成功，那么南京还有什么希望呢？（二）占据了城市，并不是占据了所有的一切，…………而且不管国民党拿了多少城市，如果没有永久解决的话，共产党总是统治着周围的乡村。（三）内战的继续，对共产党比对国民党来得更有利。在比较和平与繁荣的时代里，中国的冷静的农民（现在约占人口百分之九十），差不多对任何统治都是无所谓的。但是在拖延的冲突中，加上饥荒与人命牺牲的结果，一定能产生一种革命情绪的大浪潮。内战持续的愈久，也就使更多人倾向于延安。过去几个月的事实，也就证明了这点。和平与繁荣，可以给群众带来冷静。（四）内战愈继续得强烈，把中国变成第二个或更大的西班牙的诱惑也更大，当然，在拖延的斗争之中，国民党绝不是唯一可以得到外援的一个。到现在为止，比起国民党所获得的帮助来说，共产党所得到的外援还是很少，但是这事情能继续很久吗？这些都是国民党所必须考虑的不愉快的事实。真的，他们已经比在战争结束的时候更不利了，比起一九三七年七月七日就更不利。这结论，南京一定不会喜欢的，但是它却符合于真理。六月十四日，上海大美晚报社论《朝向着光明》一文，向国民党当局提出同样的警告。该文指出：“国民政府某些人们正在计划爆发全面内战，并获得某些外国人的支持，但是国民党当局这一内战计划实现时，他们将不可免地遇到严重的困难和危险。反之，共产党则将具有中国全民族对抗日本时所具有的利益。“共产党在许多地区将得到农村的拥护，而为其对手所无”。因此，该文呼吁国民党当局放弃其内战政策，以和平方法成立联合政府，该文说：“无疑地，这将有利于民族，而在多党参加的政府中，我们能够预见各党都能以民主方法，求得发展的机会”。
