　　Spies in Handan Second District Sabotage Mass Movement
    Turn-Over Teams Go to Launch Vigorous Assault

    [Reported by this newspaper] The peasant turn-over teams assigned to work in Handan County have decided to concentrate their forces to break through the situation in the Second District, and have already departed from the county for the villages on the 26th of last month. Before their departure, Director Shi of the County National Salvation Association introduced the local mass movement situation and problems. It is said that the current anti-traitor movement among the masses in that area has not been thoroughly carried out. The main reason is that the peasant organizations are not consolidated, and the leadership has been resolving internal problems of the peasant association, not daring to let go boldly. In the past, the peasant association and militia organizations in that area, due to excessive emphasis on "leniency" in organization during the anti-traitor campaign, were infiltrated by a group of traitors and puppet army personnel who had plans and preparations, who seized partial leadership power, and implemented "corruption policies" towards good village cadres and activists, inducing them to embezzle or waste the fruits of the mass struggle, causing mass dissatisfaction. They provoked the peasant association to exclude the trade union, not allowing the trade union to participate in the anti-traitor struggle, causing conflict between workers and peasants; or they provoked East Street and West Street to oppose each other, thus confusing the masses' vision, allowing traitors, bullies and lawless landlords to escape punishment. When someone raised these issues, they tried to perfunctorily deal with them. In addition, they used feudal superstitious organizations such as "Yiguandao," "Yizi Shengxian Dao," and "Shanshe" to deceive and win over people, relaxing the masses' fighting spirit. Director Shi emphasized that it is necessary to thoroughly expose the conspiracies of traitors and landlords, and quickly and resolutely cleanse the internal saboteurs, not fearing that this will shrink the organization, but to organize the truly oppressed and exploited working masses in the vast peasant anti-traitor, grievance-airing, and revenge movement. The turn-over team comrades had a specific discussion on the situation introduced by Director Shi and the opinions raised, and finally decided to focus on the masses' current most urgent anti-traitor demands, and let go to lead the masses to carry out "communication," incubation, and struggle. However, in the anti-traitor campaign, they do not reject the problems raised by the peasants in other aspects, but seize every problem and guide the development of a broad movement.

　　邯郸二区奸细破坏群运
    翻身队前往大力突击
    【本报讯】分配在邯郸县工作的农民翻身队，决定首先要中火力，突开二区局面，并已于上月二十六日从县里分头下乡，行前曾由县救国会石主任介绍当地群运情况与问题。据称：目前该地群众反奸运动而未深入，主要原因则是农民组织不巩固，领导上一直在解决农会内部问题，不敢大胆放手，该地农会，民兵组织，过去曾由于过分强调反奸中组织上的“宽大”，被一部分有计划、有准备的汉奸、伪军人员混入，掌握了部分的领导权，对好的村干部与积极分子实行“腐化政策”，诱其贪污或浪费群众斗争果实，造成群众不满；挑拨农会排斥工会，不让工会参加反奸等斗争，造成工农互斗；或挑动东街西街互相对立，这样迷惑了群众视线，使汉奸恶霸与不法地主得以逍遥法外，有人提出这类问题，也设法敷衍过去，另外又利用封建迷信组织如“一贯道”，“一字圣贤道”，“善社”等进行欺骗、拉拢，松懈群众斗争情绪。石主任强调指出：要彻底戳穿汉奸地主的阴谋，迅速坚决清洗内部破坏分子，不要怕因此缩小组织，而要在掀起广大农民反奸诉苦复仇运动中，把真正受压迫受剥削的劳动群众组织起来。翻身队同志曾就石主任介绍的情况与提出的意见进行具体讨论，最后确定抓紧群众当前最迫切的反奸要求，放手领导群众进行“串通”，酝酿与斗争。但在反奸中也不拒绝农民提出其他方面的问题，而要抓住每一问题，引导展开广大的运动。
