Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 12th—The broad masses in the areas of the Third District of Jiangsu-Anhui (east of the Jinpu Railway on the south bank of the Huai River) that have been invaded by Kuomintang troops and puppet troops in violation of agreements have risen up to organize guerrilla units to carry out heroic self-defense. More than 600 people in the Hongsu and Dushan districts of Jiashan County have organized homemade gun teams. On one occasion, more than 20 invaders came to Dingmu Village in Dushan District to loot. Ding San, an old farmer in his fifties, led two villagers to resist stubbornly with a homemade gun and a basket of stones. Although Old Ding San was shot in the leg, he desperately threw stones and persisted until reinforcements from the Third District arrived, finally repelling the invading army. More than 50 militiamen from the Sanhe District of Ganquan County launched a counterattack against a company of the 148th Division of the Kuomintang 25th Army that had invaded my Hulu Mountain (seven li west of Yangzhou), harassing them and forcing them to retreat once. More than 100 militiamen from Lai'an rushed into Shiguangji, a major town five li southeast of Lai'an City (invaded by the Kuomintang army on the 8th of last month), to search for plainclothes special agents and intercept Kuomintang troops from harassing the area. Shi Fude, a special agent who sneaked into Matou Township, Lai'an, attempted to instigate mutiny among militiamen He Baolian and others, but was captured by He and others instead.
