　　Two-Ten Thousand Person Rally in the Border Region, Handan
    Commemorates “July 7th” and Opposes Civil War
    Chairman Yang Calls For: Increase Confidence, Prepare Strength, Resolutely Defend Ourselves!
    [Our Newspaper, Handan Special Dispatch] The Kuomintang reactionaries are actively preparing and provoking a nationwide civil war, arousing the unstoppable indignation of people from all walks of life in the border region. On the 3rd of this month, more than 20,000 people from all walks of life in the border region held a grand rally at the Handan Stadium to commemorate "July 7th" in advance and to stage an anti-civil war demonstration against the Kuomintang reactionaries. At 4:00 PM, a continuous stream of people poured into the venue from every corner of Handan City. People held small flags of various colors, with slogans such as "Oppose Civil War" and "Oppose American Imperialist Elements Supporting the Kuomintang in Carrying out Civil War" written on them. Everyone knew that the Kuomintang's instigation of this civil war was not only an unprecedented large-scale massacre against the people of the whole country, but also an attempt to turn China into an American colony. In order to defend China's independence, peace, and democracy, they braved the scorching July sun and rushed to express their opinions.
    After Mayor Wang Yuechen announced the opening of the meeting, Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government stepped onto the stage amidst thunderous applause and delivered a speech. His serious attitude and painful voice aroused the anger and roar of the entire audience like a tidal wave. He said: "Today we are here again to oppose civil war. We are holding such a large meeting with great sorrow. Because after defeating Japan, we all hoped for peace, but today the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek wants to fight a civil war again. We are brought to tears hearing this news..." The slogan "Oppose the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek's civil war" was constantly shouted from the crowd. He continued, "The civil war has already started. The Kuomintang has surrounded the Central Plains Military Region with twenty-five divisions. We must rise up to oppose the expansion of the civil war!" When he mentioned that American imperialist elements were treating China as a colony, helping Chiang Kai-shek fight a civil war and massacre the people, he excitedly shouted: "We demand peace and democracy! Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's Qin Hui government! Oppose the puppet emperor! Oppose American imperialist policy! Demand that American troops withdraw from China!" More than 20,000 people present also roared from the bottom of their hearts! Finally, he pointed out with a hundredfold confidence in victory: "If the reactionaries want to attack, we will resolutely defend ourselves. Our armed comrades have undergone very good training and will definitely be able to win!" The entire crowd responded with applause of infinite trust. He also emphasized: "The people must also believe in themselves. In the old liberated areas, during the War of Resistance, the counter-offensive, and the self-defense war, thousands upon thousands of people went to the front lines. This power is great." The crowd followed with shouts: "Our power is great! We must learn from the people of the old liberated areas and help the army win victories!" (Chairman Yang's speech will be published separately)
            Rickshaw Puller He Zhaoxun Said: We Must Fight Back Against America Helping Chiang Kai-shek Seize the Liberated Areas
    He Zhaoxun, a rickshaw puller who had turned over under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, rushed to the stage and said: "Chiang Kai-shek is just like the iron millstone in Yongnian City, oppressing the people." He raised his strong fist and shouted with his loud voice: "America is helping Chiang Kai-shek seize our liberated areas. We cannot let him. We must fight him back!"
            Farmer Li Qingshan Said: The People Must Unite Under the Leadership of Chairman Mao and Smash the Attacking Reactionaries to Pieces
    Li Qingshan, the chairman of the Farmers' Association of Dongxiaotun in the outer city district, said even more excitedly: "America's helping Lao Jiang fight a civil war is just like Japan's helping Wang Jingwei, wanting to invade China and extort our people. Eating our flesh, drinking our blood, and not letting us turn over. I propose sending a telegram to the good people of America, calling on them to oppose the bad guys in their government and oppose helping Chiang Kai-shek. Also send a telegram to Chairman Mao, asking him to lead us well to turn over. Tell him: We swear before him that we are willing to resolutely oppose the same bullying by America and Japan under his leadership. We have suffered enough from Japan and the traitors in the past. Chairman Mao knows what we are thinking. As long as he gives an order, we will do whatever he tells us to do, even if it means risking our lives. We fought Japan and the traitors for seven or eight years. We have the methods and the strength to fight imperialism and the reactionaries to the end." This was followed by a burst of thunderous applause and slogans: "Right! We will follow Chairman Mao and fight the reactionaries to the end!" He continued, "We the people must also unite, regardless of East Village or West Village, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and become a solid iron block, helping the army transport bullets, carry the wounded, and deliver water and food. Smash the reactionaries who are attacking us to pieces!"
    Finally, Vice Chairman Li of the Commercial Federation proposed supporting the just action of 50,000 Shanghai citizens against the civil war and sending a telegram to express condolences to the petition representatives, including Ma Xulun, who were beaten by Kuomintang secret agents, which was unanimously approved by the entire audience.
    As the sun set, the demonstration march of more than 20,000 people began. The magnificent ranks passed slowly through the wide streets, and many merchants and citizens temporarily joined the demonstration ranks. The deafening slogans of "Oppose Civil War" and "Oppose American Interference in China's Internal Affairs" shook the streets and alleys of Handan. Until dusk, the fire of righteous indignation against the civil war still burned throughout the city of Handan.
            General Telegram from the Congress to the Whole Country, Yan'an, Chairman Mao, Chairman Zhang of the Democratic League, the National Political Consultative Conference, the Political Consultative Conference, National Newspaper Offices, Legal Entities and Fellow Compatriots:
    Ever since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance has been achieved, and the Three Agreements have been signed one after another. Compatriots across the country were expecting peace and democracy, recuperation, and the hope of building a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, prosperous, and strong. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on the military and economic assistance of the United States, disregarded the fate of the country and the lives of the people, attempted to dictatorship, were warlike by nature, used demobilization as a mobilization, used truce as preparation for war, and recently brazenly provoked a full-scale civil war. Externally, they sold out sovereignty, willing to kneel down as grandsons. Internally, they carried out massacres, regarding the people as fish and meat. The whole country, which had just celebrated its escape from the invasion of the Japanese invaders, was plunged into the terror of civil war again. All we have hoped for in the past few years of bloodshed and sacrifice is nothing more than peace, democracy, and freedom, but now it has been destroyed again! At this critical juncture, people from all walks of life in this region solemnly declare: We firmly oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war policy, demand the realization of comprehensive peace and democracy, respect public opinion, and thoroughly implement the Three Agreements, and warn the Kuomintang dictatorial government to stop all treasonous acts, recover lost sovereignty, and ensure national dignity. If the Kuomintang reactionaries act recklessly and do not know how to be afraid, the people of our entire region swear to resolutely defend ourselves, so that those who love war will burn themselves.
                                  The Anti-Civil War Conference of All Circles in the Jin-He-Lu-Yu Border Region bows

            Telegram to the US President and the American People, Transferred by the Nanjing Three-Person Committee to President Truman and the American People for Consideration:
    The friendship between the people of China and the United States has long been evident. In the past anti-fascist struggle, we fought hand in hand and achieved victory. We support the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference's agreement on assisting China. We welcome President Truman's past statements supporting China's peace and democracy and not interfering in China's internal affairs. Because these are in line with the wishes of the Chinese people who have long yearned for peace and democracy.
    Recently, your government has contradicted its words and deeds. From military to economic aspects, it has helped the Chinese Kuomintang dictatorial government attack the people who advocate peace and democracy, and further infringed on China's rights to navigate its internal rivers, airspace, and territorial waters. The large army has not withdrawn, but instead intends to stay for a long time to armed interfere in China's internal affairs. All these actions that violate international law and credibility are clearly visible to everyone.
    Here, we solemnly declare to your country that the Chinese people have gone through a hundred years of struggle against unequal treaties, and have gone through eight years of the most arduous national resistance war. In the struggle, they have been tempered to be stronger and smarter, good at distinguishing friendship from hatred, and good at expressing our enthusiasm and anger. Therefore, we hope that your government will cherish the traditional friendship between China and the United States and your country's honor and credibility, immediately withdraw American troops stationed in China, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and enable China's comprehensive peace and democracy to arrive as soon as possible, which will not only be the fortune of the Chinese people.
                              The Anti-Civil War Conference of All Circles in the China Jin-He-Lu-Yu Border Region bows

　　边区两万人集会邯郸
    纪念“七七”反对内战
    杨主席号召：提高信心，准备力量，坚决自卫！
    【本报邯郸特讯】国民党反动派积极准备与挑起全国范围的内战，引起边区各界人民不可遏止的愤慨。本月三日，边区各界两万余人，在邯郸体育场举行盛大集会，提前纪念“七七”，并向国民党反动派实行反内战示威。午后四时，连绵不断的人流从邯市每个角落里涌入会场，人们手执各色小旗，上书“反对内战”、“反对美国帝国主义分子支持国民党进行内战”等字样。大家晓得，国民党挑动这次内战不但是向全国人民实行空前大规模的屠杀，而且是想把中国变成美国的殖民地，他们为了保卫中国的独立、和平与民主，不顾七月炙人的太阳，纷纷赶来表示自己的意见。
    王悦尘市长宣布开会后，边府杨主席在雷动的掌声中登台讲演。他那严肃的态度，沉痛的声音，激起全场海潮般的愤激和怒吼。他说：“今天我们又来反对内战了，我们开这样的大会是很沉痛的。因为打倒了日本，我们都希望和平，可是今天国民党蒋介石又要打内战，我们听到这个消息是要掉泪的……”“反对国民党蒋介石打内战”的口号，从人群中不断的喊出来，他又说：“内战已经打起来了，国民党用二十五个师把中原军区包围起来了，我们要起来反对扩大内战！”当述及美帝国主义分子将中国当成殖民地，帮助蒋介石打内战，打老百姓时，他激愤的高呼：“我们要求和平民主！反对蒋介石的秦桧政府！反对儿皇帝！反对美帝国主义政策！要求美国军队撤出中国去！”到会的两万多人，也跟他从心底里发出震天动地的吼声！最后他以百倍胜利信心指出：“如果反动派要打来，我们坚决自卫，我们武装同志们是经过很好锻炼的，是一定能够打胜仗的！”全体群众至此报以无限信赖的掌声。他又强调说：“老百姓还要相信自己，老解放区的老百姓在抗战中、反攻中、自卫战争中，都有着千千万万的人上前线，这个力量是伟大的。”群众跟着高呼：“我们的力量是伟大的！我们要学习老解放区的老百姓，帮助军队打胜仗！”（杨主席演讲见另文）
            洋车夫贺兆勋说：美国帮助蒋介石夺取解放区我们要把他打回去
    在共产党，民主政府领导下翻了身的洋车夫贺兆勋抢上台去说：“蒋介石和永年城里的铁磨头一样，都是压迫老百姓的。”他举起粗壮的拳头，放开粗亮的嗓子喊道：“美国帮助蒋介石夺取我们解放区，我们不能让他，我们要把他打回去！”
            农民李青山说：老百姓要团结在毛主席领导下把进攻的反动派打个稀烂
    市外区东小屯的农会主席李青山更加激昂的说：“美国帮老蒋打内战，就和日本帮汪精卫一样，要想侵略中国，讹诈我们老百姓。吃我们的肉，喝我们的血，不让我们翻身。我提议给美国的好老百姓打个电报，叫他们反对他们政府里的坏家伙，反对帮助蒋介石。再给毛主席打个电报，叫他好好领导我们翻身。告诉他：我们在他面前发誓，愿意在他的领导下，坚决反对美国和日本一样的欺侮咱们。咱们过去受日本、受汉奸的罪受够了，毛主席知道咱们的心思，只要他下个命令，叫咱们干啥，咱们就拚着死命干啥。咱们和日本、和汉奸拚了七八年，咱们有办法，有力量，和帝国主义和反动派干到底。”接着是一阵雷动的掌声和口号声：“对！我们跟着毛主席，和反动派干到底！”他又说：“我们老百姓还要团结，不分东村西村，在毛主席领导下，成一个铁块子，帮助军队，运子弹、抬伤兵、送水送饭。把向我们进攻的反动派打个稀烂！”
    最后，商联会李副主席提议声援上海五万市民反内战的正义行动，致电慰问被国特殴伤的请愿代表马叙伦等，当经全场一致通过。
    在夕阳傍山的时候，开始了两万余人的示威游行。雄壮的行列在广阔的街头缓缓而过，许多商人、市民临时卷入示威的行列中。高喊如雷的“反对内战”、“反对美国干涉中国内政”的口号震动了邯郸的大街小巷。直到暮色苍茫的时候，反内战的义愤之火仍然燃遍邯郸全城。
            大会通电全国延安毛主席、民主同盟张主席、国民参政会、政治协商会议、全国各报馆、各法团暨全国同胞公厅：
    溯自日寇投降，八年抗战之胜利既得，三大协定又继之签订，全国同胞方期和平民主可待，休养生息，建设独立自由民主统一富强之新中国有望，乃国民党反动派恃美国军事经济等之资助，置国运民命于不顾，妄图独裁，好战成性，假复员以动员，借休战以备战，近更悍然挑起全面大内战。对外则出卖主权，不惜屈膝为儿孙。对内则实行屠杀，视人民为鱼肉。使全国方庆脱日寇之侵凌，又陷入内战之恐怖。几年来吾人流血牺牲，所望无他，和平民主自由而已，今竟又遭破坏矣！当此严重关头，本区各界人士郑重表示：我们坚决反对国民党反动派之内战政策，要求实现全面和平民主，尊重人民公意，彻底实现三大协议，并警告国民党独裁政府，停止一切卖国行为，收回已失主权，确保民族尊严。设国民党反动派肆意妄为，不知戒惧，我全区人民誓坚决自卫，使好战者玩火自焚。
                                  晋冀鲁豫边区各界反内战大会叩
            致美总统暨全美人民电南京三人委员会转杜鲁门总统暨全美人民公鉴：
    中美两国人民，友谊素著，在过去反法西斯斗争中曾经携手奋斗，获得胜利。我们拥护莫斯科三外长会议关于协助中国之协议，我们欢迎杜鲁门总统过去支持中国和平民主不干涉中国内政之声明。因为这些是与长期渴望和平民主之中国人民的愿望相符合的。
    近来贵国政府，言行相违，从军事以至经济各方面，帮助中国国民党独裁政府，进攻主张和平民主的人民，并进而侵犯中国内河航行、领空、领海诸权，大军不撤，反图久驻以武装干涉中国内政，凡此种种，违反国际公法与信义之行动，均彰彰在人耳目。
    于此我们特向贵国郑重声明，中国人民已经过了一百年反不平等条约的斗争，又经过了八年最艰苦的民族抗战，在斗争中已经锻炼得更坚强、更聪明，善于辨别友谊与仇视，也善于表现我们的热情与愤怒。因此，希望贵国政府，珍惜中美传统友谊和贵国的荣誉信义，立即撤退驻华美国军队，停止干涉中国内政，使中国全面和平民主早日到来，则不只中国人民之幸也。
                              中国晋冀鲁豫边区各界反内战大会叩
