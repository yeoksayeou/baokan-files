Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 18th: Comprehensive reports: The biggest traitor of Yugoslavia, Mihailović, was executed by firing squad on the 17th, after more than a month of interrogation. At the same time, thirty former Chetnik "puppet army" leaders were also executed. Among the 23 defendants in the Mihailović case, ten were sentenced to death, and the remaining thirteen were sentenced to prison terms ranging from twenty years to one and a half years. During the trial of the traitor Mihailović, the United States sent three notes to the Yugoslav government, demanding to defend his "innocence." The American representative in Belgrade also attempted to prove that Mihailović "actively fought against the enemy" and was their so-called "true hero." However, under the solemn trial of the Yugoslav military court, even Mihailović himself could not deny that the Chetniks (of which he was the leader) did indeed "fight together" with the German army against the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army, and confessed that in late 1942, British Colonel Bailey, who served in Mihailović's army, had asked him to "eliminate the guerrillas." After Mihailović was convicted, a US State Department spokesman declared: "The US government does not intend to protect Mihailović," and British Foreign Secretary Bevin also said: "The British government has no right to interfere further in trials conducted according to the laws of a sovereign state."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 18th: *Liberation Daily* published a commentary "The Death of Mihailović," stating: This is a glorious victory for the Yugoslav people, and it signifies that the Yugoslav people have won independence and freedom. It continued: Our country still has many Mihailovićes of all kinds, who are now colluding with American reactionaries and are willing to turn China into a colony of American imperialism in order to carry out civil war and maintain dictatorship. Finally, it pointed out that the German invaders once helped Mihailović establish a puppet army, the American reactionary General MacDowell had dealings with him, and the British reactionary General Lister-son had said to Mihailović: "As long as you destroy the Communist Party, your position will improve." Now it is not the Yugoslav Communist Party that has been destroyed, but Mihailović himself. This once again proves that the trend of national independence and democracy in the world is irresistible; those who act as slaves of foreign imperialism, carry out civil war, and maintain dictatorship have only one way to go – death! The execution of Mihailović is a serious warning to China's Mihailovićes.

　　米海洛维区伏法  
    解放日报发表时评：
    是给中国米贼严重警告
    【新华社延安十八日电】综合报导：南斯拉夫最大卖国贼米海洛维区，经过月余之审讯，已于十七日执行枪决。与之同时处死者，尚有前契特尼克“伪军”首领三十人。米海洛维区同案之二十三名被告中，有十人判处死刑，其余十三人判处二十年至一年半之有期徒刑。在审判米贼中，美国曾三度照会南政府，要求为他的“无罪”辩护。美国驻贝尔格莱德代表，亦曾企图证明米贼“曾积极对敌作战”，是他们的所谓“真正的英雄”。但在南军事法庭严正的审判下，连米海洛维区自己也不能不承认契特尼克（他是契特尼克魁首）确和德军对南国人民解放军“共同作战”，并且供认一九四二年底服务于米海洛维区军队的英国贝莱上校等，曾叫他“消灭游击队”。在米贼定罪后，美国务院发言人始宣称：“美政府不拟袒护米海洛维区”，英外相贝文亦说：“英国政府无权对按照主权国法律所进行的审判，作进一步的干涉”。
    【新华社延安十八日电】解放日报发表时评“米海洛维区之死”，内称：这是南国人民光荣的胜利，是表示南国人民已争得了独立和自由。继称：我国还有许多各式各样的米海洛维区，现在又和美国反动派勾结，为了进行内战和维持独裁，不惜把中国变成美帝国主义的殖民地。最后，举出德国侵略者曾帮助米贼建立伪军，美国反动将军马克道尔也曾与之过往，英国反动将军李斯特逊曾对米贼说：“只要你毁灭共产党，你的地位就会改善”。现在毁灭的不是南国共产党，而正是米贼自己，再一次证明全世界民族独立民主的潮流之不可抗拒；做外国帝国主义的奴才，进行内战和维持独裁的，只有死路一条！米贼的处死，正是给中国米海洛维区的严重警告。
