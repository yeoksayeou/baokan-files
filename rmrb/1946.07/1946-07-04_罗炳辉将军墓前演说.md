Speech at General Luo Binghui's Tomb
    Chen Yi

　　As we bid farewell to Deputy Commander Luo forever, I represent the entire body of commanders and fighters of the East China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shandong Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army in expressing our deep sorrow and offering our highest revolutionary salute to him!

　　Deputy Commander Luo passed away at the age of forty-nine, but for thirty-two years he fought for the revolution. He participated in the war to protect the country against Yuan Shikai, the Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927, the ten-year Soviet movement, and the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, four revolutionary movements. He was the son of a peasant, and joined the army as a soldier at the age of sixteen. For thirty years, Deputy Commander Luo has always maintained the revolutionary mass character of peasants and soldiers. He never forgot his roots. He did not turn his guns against the peasants just because he became an officer. On the contrary, he was once an officer in the Kuomintang army. When the Kuomintang launched a purge of the Communists at the end of the Northern Expedition and then launched a large-scale encirclement and suppression of revolutionary armed forces, he turned to the people from the uprising and opposed the counter-revolution. Comrade Luo Binghui was a revolutionary general from a soldier's background, and also a revolutionary general who revolted from the Kuomintang army. From the day he organized the uprising, Comrade Luo Binghui became a communist from a veteran democrat. Under the leadership of our party, he created the revolutionary armed forces of the Chinese people, and during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he vigorously cultivated the New Fourth Army and opened up the Central China Liberated Area. The name of Comrade Luo Binghui has been praised by peace-loving people at home and abroad. The death of Deputy Commander Luo is a major loss to our party!

　　In recent years, due to the extreme hardships and difficulties of the war behind enemy lines, Deputy Commander Luo suffered from overwork and contracted high blood pressure. The Party notified him to rest several times, but he sincerely refused because his high sense of responsibility for the Chinese people's liberation cause had surpassed his concern for himself. Recently, his illness worsened, and after repeated persuasion, he reluctantly agreed to rest. However, when the Kuomintang reactionaries destroyed the truce agreement, once again provoked a civil war, and launched a large-scale invasion of the liberated areas, General Binghui had to personally go to the forefront of the self-defense war. When the puppet troops in Zaozhuang were wiped out under his heroic command (missing four words) hundreds of thousands of miners and nearby residents were able to see the light of day again and express their grievances. However, at this time of busy military affairs and hot summer, Comrade Luo Binghui unfortunately suffered a relapse of his old illness. On the 16th, he suddenly suffered from acute gastritis, and on the 21st, he returned to Linyi from the front line to rest. On the way to Lanling in the east, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. After many attempts to rescue him, he finally said goodbye to us at 5 pm!

　　Comrades, the disaster-ridden Chinese nation and the disaster-ridden Chinese people are more grieved and saddened by the death of their vanguard fighters and revolutionary leaders than by the loss of any relatives. However, the close comrades-in-arms of Comrade Luo Binghui should know that the Kuomintang is grinning at us, planning to eliminate us, and the reactionaries want the Chinese people to withdraw all democratic demands, recognize fascist feudal dictatorship, and want the Chinese people to obey his reactionary orders, lay down their arms, and be eliminated by him. Therefore, we should enter into preparations for self-defense, and we must not let the fascist reactionaries succeed. Today we must wipe away our tears and bravely and firmly stand at our self-defense posts, inherit the unfinished business of the deceased. The great revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people is extremely difficult. The first batch falls, the second batch rushes up, the third batch rushes up, using their heads and hot blood to exchange for the freedom of the people and protect the independence of the nation. The final victory is in the hands of our people. Only in this way is the best way to commemorate the martyrs, and only in this way will the revolutionary martyrs like us to commemorate him.

　　On the 19th and 21st, when Comrade Luo Binghui set off to return to Linyi, he repeatedly talked to me about the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Yunnan Army. He cheered for the uprising of Commander Pan Shuoduan in southern Manchuria. He personally drafted his congratulatory telegram and sent letters to all his old friends in Yunnan. Luo Binghui was born in the Yunnan Army and received a revolutionary democratic education in the Yunnan Army. He was most concerned about the people and army of Yunnan throughout his life. Comrade Luo Binghui represents the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Yunnan Army. The telegram he sent to congratulate Commander Pan is his hope for the officers and soldiers of the Yunnan Army and his hope for the soldiers and civilians of his hometown. We should be responsible for conveying one of his遗志.

　　Finally, we say: "Comrade Luo Binghui, rest in peace. Today we swear before your tomb and make a vow before your tomb. At this time when the threat of civil war is extremely serious, we vow to commemorate you by victoriously defending democracy and peace. Comrades, the peace talks in China have been going on for several months, and now it proves that the peace of our people cannot be bestowed by the reactionaries, and the reactionaries have no sincerity to put down their whips against the Chinese people. We cannot beg for peace from heaven, or be given peace as charity. We have to prepare our own self-defense forces. If the reactionaries dare to attack us, we will definitely repel them. Let us hold a grand memorial service for General Luo when we achieve the final victory of peace and democracy.

　　罗炳辉将军墓前演说
    陈毅
    当我们与罗副军长永别的时候，我代表中共华东局暨山东八路军、新四军的全体指战员，向他致沉痛与以崇高的革命敬礼！
    罗副军长享年四十九岁，但有三十二年是为革命而斗争，他参加过反对袁世凯的护国战役，一九二五年至一九二七年大革命、十年苏维埃运动和八年抗日战争四次革命运动。他是一个农民子弟，十六岁时入伍当兵，卅年来，罗副军长一直保持农民和士兵的革命群众本色，他从来没有忘本，他并不因为当了军官便带着兵掉转枪口去反对农民，相反的他曾经是国民党军队的军官，当北伐末期国民党举行清党反共之后又大举进行围剿革命武装时，他便从起义中转到人民方面来，反对反革命。罗炳辉同志是一个士兵出身的革命将军，又曾是一个国民党军队起义的革命将军，从组织起义之日起，罗炳辉同志便由一个民主老战士进而成为一个共产主义者。他在我党的领导之下，创造了中国人民的革命武装，并在抗战期间，有力的培植了新四军，开辟华中解放区。罗炳辉同志的名字，已为爱好和平的中外人士所传颂。罗副军长的病故，是我党一个重大的损失！
    近几年来，由于敌后战争的极端艰苦与困难，致使罗副军长积劳成疾，患血压过高病，党曾数次通知他休养，但他却恳切拒绝了，因为他对于中国人民解放事业的高度负责，已超过他对于自己的爱护。最近病势转剧，再三相劝他才勉强的愿意休养，可是当国民党反动派破坏停战协定，再度挑起内战，向解放区大举进犯时，炳辉将军又不得不亲自出马，奔走于自卫战争的最前线。当枣庄伪军在他英勇的指挥下消灭（缺四字）十万矿工及附近居民，乃得重见天日，申诉冤苦。可是，当此军务繁忙，夏日炎炎之际，罗炳辉同志不幸旧病复发，十六日突患急性胃炎，二十一日由前方返临沂休息，东行兰陵途次，又患脑充血，多方急救无效，终于下午五时与我们永别了！
    同志们，多灾多难的中华民族及多灾多难的中国人民，对于他的先锋战士革命领袖的死去，是比失去任何亲人都要哀痛而难受，但是罗炳辉同志的亲密的战友们，应该知道国民党正在向我们狞笑，正在计划消灭我们，反动派正要中国人民撤回一切民主要求，承认法西斯封建独裁，要中国人民服从他的反动命令、放下武器，为他消灭。因此，我们应进入自卫的准备，千万不能让法西斯反动派得手，我们今天要擦干眼泪，勇敢的坚定的站在自卫的岗位上去，承继死者未竟的事业，伟大的中国人民的革命斗争，是万分艰难的，第一批倒下了，第二批冲上去，第三批冲上去，以头颅热血换取人民的自由和保护民族的独立，最后胜利之券，是操在我们人民手掌中的。只有这样，才是纪念先烈的最好办法，也只有这样，革命的先烈才喜欢我们来纪念他。
    罗炳辉同志在十九日和二十一日动身回临沂的那几天，都再三再四的和我谈滇军的革命光荣传统，他为潘朔端师长在南满的起义欢呼，他亲手拟其贺电，并分函他所有的云南故交。罗炳辉出身于滇军在滇军中深受革命民主的教育，一生最关心云南人民及其军队，罗炳辉同志代表滇军的革命光荣传统，他致贺潘师长的电文是他对滇军将士的热望和他留给他故乡军民的热望，我们应该负责将他的遗志之一加以传达的。
    最后，我们说：“罗炳辉同志你好好的安息吧，我们今天在你墓前宣誓，在你墓前许愿，值此内战威胁极端严重之际，我们誓以胜利地保卫民主和平来纪念你。同志们，全中国的和平进行了数月的谈判，现在证明我们人民的和平不能由反动派恩赐，反动派也绝无诚意放下他对中国人民的鞭子，我们不能向天乞求和平，恩赐和平，我们只好准备自己的自卫力量，如果反动派敢于进攻我们，一定将他击退，让我们在取得和平民主的最后胜利时，再为罗将军举行隆重的追悼大会。
