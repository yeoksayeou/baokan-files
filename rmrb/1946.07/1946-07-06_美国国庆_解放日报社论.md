　　U.S. National Day
    Liberation Daily Editorial

    July 4th is the U.S. National Day - Independence Day. One hundred and seventy years ago today, the American people published a great historical document - the "Declaration of Independence," thus launching the war of independence against British colonial rule. Inspired by the lofty ideals of "natural rights," "equality, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" in the "Declaration of Independence," the American people fought through setbacks for eight years and finally won the final victory of the national revolutionary war. The American Revolutionary War was the first national revolutionary war in history to achieve true victory and one of the greatest truly resolved and truly revolutionary wars. The Declaration of Independence shows the truth that our national independence and democratic freedom are inseparable. American founding fathers like Washington (the drafter of the Declaration of Independence, the Elimination of Landlordism Act, the Freedom of Thought Act, the Universal Education Act, and the Prohibition of Trampling and Restriction of Women's Act), Lincoln, the liberator of black slaves and son of a poor carpenter, and Roosevelt, who led the American anti-fascist war and advocated for the Four Freedoms, were leaders of the American people representing this historical tradition of the Declaration of Independence.

    The Chinese people admire the glorious historical tradition of the American people. For over a century, the Chinese people have unflinchingly fought heroically for their own independence, democracy, and freedom, and have experienced their own "War of Independence" - the War of Resistance Against Japan. Because today's environment in China is different from the environment in America one hundred and seventy years ago, the Chinese people face not only feudal forces but also powerful imperialist forces. Therefore, after a hundred years of arduous struggle and the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese people have not been able to rapidly realize the common rights of civil rule, government by the people, and government for the people, as the American people did after their eight-year War of Independence. Today, the people of most of China are groaning under the tyrannical rule of the Kuomintang dictatorial government, which, as described by a reporter for Time magazine, is an "evil government." To quote the American "Declaration of Independence," "It has consistently pursued a series of abuses and dictatorships towards the same objective, proving a conspiracy to place the people under absolute despotism." The "Declaration of Independence" states: "It is the right and duty of the people to overthrow such a government and to establish new safeguards for the future security of the people." However, the Chinese people have always been the most tolerant. Today, the Chinese people do not exercise the "right and duty of the people" to "overthrow" such an "evil government" as stated in the American Declaration of Independence, but only ask it to relinquish absolute despotism and reorganize the current government into a democratic coalition government through peaceful political consultation. What policy has the Kuomintang government adopted towards this minimum demand of the Chinese people? Its policy is to launch a large-scale civil war, strengthen its terror, bloodily suppress the people's movement for peace and democracy, and maintain its absolute despotism at the expense of the interests of the 450 million Chinese people! What policy has the American authority adopted towards such an "evil government" in China? The current U.S. policy is to unconditionally and forcefully support the Chiang Kai-shek government, enabling it to recklessly persist in dictatorship and civil war, plunging China into a tragic situation of chaos, terror, and poverty! In addition to the already existing facts of interference in China's internal affairs (such as providing large amounts of materials, equipment, training, and transportation to the Chiang army, helping the Chiang army protect roads, build roads, protect ports, and stationing troops in China for a long time to assist Chiang in the civil war), the U.S. has also proposed a military aid to Chiang bill to the U.S. Congress. This proposal will not only undermine the Chinese people's cause of peace and democracy but also make the Chiang army completely dependent on foreign powers and turn China into a second Philippines. That is to say, American imperialist elements, through the Chinese dictator Chiang Kai-shek, are attempting to make the Chinese people taste the flavor of colonial slavery again after the victory of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, which the Chinese people firmly oppose. The American people can easily understand the Chinese people's just position. They will surely put themselves in our shoes and think, if the American people, after the victory of the eight-year War of Independence, had to be ruled by another foreign country and continue to live a colonial life, could the American people endure it? Obviously, the American people would absolutely not endure it. Lincoln said, "I am neither willing to be a slave nor to be a slave owner." But today, some imperialist elements in the United States are妄想 (wàngxiǎng - vainly hoping) to be the "slave owners" of the people of the world and the Chinese people. Undoubtedly, the American people, who have tasted the bitterness of colonial oppression and liberated themselves from this oppression, have always had a passionate sympathy for the struggles of people in various countries, especially the Chinese people, for independence, freedom, and democracy. If the 450 million Chinese people are still ruled by a fascist "evil government," then there will be no peace in China, and there will be no peace in the world. This is not only a disaster for the Chinese people but also a disaster for the American people! Therefore, the American people hate the attempts of a few imperialist elements to be "slave owners," and the American people oppose the current U.S. policy toward China. This policy is completely contrary to the glorious tradition of the American Declaration of Independence - the tradition of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt. This policy greatly tarnishes this glorious tradition. The movement of the American people and democratic figures from all walks of life against the authorities' interference in China's internal affairs is growing. The declaration of the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy and Congressman Delacy's speech in the House of Representatives are just a few examples. On the occasion of U.S. National Day, in addition to extending warm congratulations to the American people, we also call on them to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Declaration of Independence, unite and stop all assistance from the authorities to the Kuomintang dictatorial government, withdraw all Lend-Lease military supplies, demand that the authorities immediately withdraw the navy, army, and air force in Chinese territory - demand that the government and Congress revoke the military aid to China bill, and quickly change the current U.S. policy toward China. In this way, the Chinese people's efforts to strive for peace, democracy, independence, and freedom will not be interfered with by external forces, the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people can be continuously enhanced, and the economic and cultural relations between China and the United States can be developed under the principle of equality and mutual benefit. We, the Chinese people, firmly believe that our struggle for peace, democracy, independence, and freedom will inevitably receive strong support from the American people and the people of other countries, just as the American people received assistance from the Spanish in the War of Independence and from people from all over Europe, especially the British people, in the war to liberate black slaves, preventing the interference of the British authorities. The Chinese people must establish a new country that is independent, free, democratic, prosperous, and strong, and will never stop until we achieve our goal! With our own unyielding efforts and the support of the people's movements in all countries around the world, no matter how many huge difficulties and obstacles lie ahead of us, we will surely overcome them and achieve the final victory of our just cause!

### 美国国庆  解放日报社论

　　美国国庆
    解放日报社论
    七月四日是美国国庆日——独立纪念日。一百七十年前的今天，美国人民发表了一个伟大的历史文献——“独立宣言”，从此展开了反对英国殖民地统治的独立战争。为“独立宣言”中“天赋人权”，“平等、自由、幸福”的崇高理想所鼓舞的美国人民，历尽挫折奋战八年，终于赢得民族革命战争的最后胜利。美国独立战争，是历史上第一次民族革命战争获得真正的胜利，也是最伟大的真正解决及真正革命的战争之一。独立宣言并显示我们民族独立与民主自由不可分割的真理。美国开国元勋华盛顿（独立宣言、消灭大地主法案、思想自由法案、全民教育法案、禁止蹂躏和限制女子法案的起草者），黑奴的解放者、穷木工的儿子林肯，领导美国反法西斯战争、倡导四大自由的罗斯福，就是代表这独立宣言历史传统的美国人民的领袖。
    中国人民羡慕美国人民的光荣历史传统。百余年来，中国人民不折不挠地为自己的独立民主自由英勇奋斗，并经历了自己的“独立战争”——抗日战争，由于今天中国的环境与一百七十年前美国的环境不同，在中国人民面前不仅有封建势力，而且还有强大的帝国主义势力，因此中国人民在百年艰苦斗争和八年抗日战争胜利之后，还没有能够像美国人民在八年独立战争之后，迅速实现民治、民有、民享的共同权。今天大半个中国的人民，正在呻吟于国民党独裁政府的虐政之下，这个政府正如美时代杂志记者所称呼的是一个“恶政府”。引美国“独立宣言”的话来说，“它一贯地追求同一目标的一连串的虐政和独裁，证明有把人民置于绝对专制之下的阴谋”。“独立宣言”中说：“推翻这样的政府，并为人民的日后安全设立新的保障，使成为人民的权利和天职”。可是，我们中国人民向来是最宽大的，今天中国人民对于这样一个“恶政府”，并不运用美国独立宣言所说的“推翻”它的“人民的权利和天职”，而只是要求它放纵绝对专制，经过和平的政治协商方式，把现政府改组为民主的联合政府。国民党政府对于中国人民这种最低限度的要求，采取了什么政策呢？它的政策就是发动大规模内战，就是加强其恐怖，就是血腥镇压人民要求和平民主的运动，就是不惜牺牲四万万五千万中国人民的利益来维持它的绝对专制！对全中国这样一个“恶政府”，美国当局方面采取了什么政策呢？美国今天的政策是无条件的以强力支持蒋介石政府，使它有恃无恐地坚持独裁内战，陷中国于混乱恐怖和贫困的惨境！美国当局除了已经进行的干涉中国内政的事实（如以大量物资供给、装备、训练、运输蒋军，替蒋军护路、筑路、保护港口、长期在华驻军等方法助蒋内战）以外，还向美国国会提出军事援蒋法案，这个提案不仅将破坏中国人民的和平民主事业，而且将使蒋军完全成为外国的附庸，将使中国变为菲律宾第二。这就是说，美国帝国主义分子通过中国的独裁者蒋介石，企图使中国人民在八年抗战胜利之后，还要尝受殖民地奴隶的滋味，这是中国人民所坚决反对的。美国人民是不难了解中国人民这一正义的立场的，他们一定会设身处地想一想，如果美国人民在八年独立战争胜利之后，还要受另外一个外国的统治，继续殖民地的生活，那末美国人民能不能忍受呢？显而易见的，美国人民是绝对不会忍受的。林肯有言：“我既不头做奴隶，也不愿当做奴隶主”。但是在今天，美国却有少数帝国主义分子正在妄图做世界人民和中国人民的“奴隶主”。无疑的，曾经饱尝殖民地压迫，并从这个压迫解放出来的美国人民，对于世界各国人民，特别是对于中国人民的争取独立自由民主的斗争，是一向具有热烈的同情的。如果中国四万万五千万人民仍然被法西斯的“恶政府”所统治，那末中国不会有和平，世界也不会有和平，这不仅是对中国人民的灾难，也是对美国人民的灾难！因此美国人民对于少数帝国主义分子想做“奴隶主”的企图是痛恨的，美国人民对于美国政府的现行对华政策是反对的，这种政策是和美国独立宣言的光荣传统——华盛顿、哲佛逊、林肯、罗斯福的传统完全背道而驰的，这种政策大大沾污了这个光荣传统。美国人民和各界民主人士反对当局干涉中国内政的运动，正在增长，美国远东民主政策委员会的宣言和德拉西议员在众议院的发言，仅仅是几个例子而已。际兹美国国庆，我们除向美国人民致热烈的庆贺外，并号召他们发扬独立宣言的光荣传统，一致起来制止当局对国民党独裁政府的一切援助，收回所有租借军火，要求当局立即撤回在中国领土上的海陆空军——要求政府和国会撤销军事援华法案，迅速改变美国现行对华政策。这样，使中国人民争取和平民主与独立自由的努力，不受到外力的干涉，使中美两国人民的传统友谊能够不断增进，中美两国的经济文化关系能够在平等互利原则下日益发展。我们中国人民坚信：我们争取和平民主与独立自由的斗争，必然获得美国人民及其他各国人民的有力的声援，正像美国人民在独立战争中获得西班牙人的援助，在解放黑奴战争中获得欧洲大陆各地人民、特别是英国人民的声援而阻止了英国当局的干涉一样，中国人民一定要建立一个独立自由民主和富强的新国家，不达目的，誓不中止！在自身坚持不屈的努力和全世界各国人民运动的声援下，不管还有许多巨大的困难和阻碍摆在我们前面，我们一定能加以克服，取得我们的正义事业的最后胜利！
