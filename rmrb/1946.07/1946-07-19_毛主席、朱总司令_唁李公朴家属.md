Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu sent a telegram to Mr. Li Gongpu's family on the 13th to express their condolences. The original telegram is as follows:

To Madam Zhang Manjun, via Kunming relay, wife of Li Gongpu:

We are deeply indignant upon learning that Mr. Li Gongpu was assassinated by reactionaries. Mr. Li dedicated himself to the cause of national salvation and progressive culture, remaining unyielding in the face of might and incorruptible by wealth. Now, he has been murdered by reactionaries for the sake of peace and democracy, which is a loss for the entire nation and an eternal glory for Mr. Li! The people of the whole country will surely take Mr. Li's death as a wake-up call and rise up to save the nation, thereby saving themselves. We respectfully send our condolences.

Mao Zedong, Zhu De, July 13th.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: Central News Agency, Kunming reports: Mr. Li Gongpu's remains were placed in a coffin yesterday and are scheduled to be cremated at Yunnan University Hospital tomorrow.
