　　Enemy Agents Actively Poisoning Our People
　　Jiyuan County Government Issues Order to Eliminate Traitors
　　[Our Yangcheng News] The Kuomintang army recently dispatched a large number of enemy agents from Meng County, Yuanqu, Pinglu and other river defense areas to sneak into Jiyuan, where they are widely poisoning our liberated area's people in a shameless act of murder. Since the seventh of this month, in the three villages of Dashe, Shihe and Yuanchang alone, more than 120 people have been poisoned. Although the Fourth Sub-district Health Department of Taiyue sent a large number of medical personnel to rush to the rescue, more than 40 people died due to severe poisoning. In addition to offering condolences and providing living assistance to the families of the victims, the county command has issued an order to the entire county to strengthen the elimination of traitors and espionage prevention, and thoroughly investigate Kuomintang special agents who are engaged in sabotage.
　　[Our Jinnan News] In order to cooperate with their civil war conspiracy, the Kuomintang reactionaries dispatched enemy agents to sneak into our liberated areas to carry out various sabotage activities. Enemy agent cases have been continuously discovered in Linqing, Wucheng and other places. According to the confessions of the captured Kuomintang special agents Guo Shiming (a member of the Kuomintang District Branch) and Liu Zhen, the current slogan for the development of enemy agents is "Facing the countryside, facing the workers and peasants, reorganizing the organization, establishing grass-roots leadership, establishing liaison stations, expanding strength, and waiting for an opportunity to riot." Their methods of activity are: 1. Establishing liaison stations, enticing and bribing ignorant young people and women to act as informants, and creating rumors in a planned manner. 2. Utilizing legal organizations in the liberated areas to establish mutual aid groups, etc., to absorb people of all kinds to participate in activities. For example, they say to landlords who are afraid of struggle: "Join our mutual aid group! If we organize, we will have strength, and the village will not dare to struggle against us." To poor peasants they say, "You are busy with struggle meetings all day long, wasting a lot of time, and you may not be able to get anything in the future. Joining our organization guarantees you several acres of land to cultivate (provided by illegal landlords)." 3. Bribing and wooing village cadres and activists in mass movements, enticing corruption, stirring up trouble, and undermining the prestige of higher-level cadres. 4. Utilizing various feudal sects and using superstitious propaganda such as "going to heaven" and "going to hell" to carry out enemy agent activities. According to confessions, these include feudal sects such as the Buddhist Rites, Xiantan Society, Sage and Virtuous Way, Qinghong Gang, and Yiguan Dao, some of which have been controlled and utilized by enemy agents. The cracking of this case has aroused serious vigilance among our soldiers and civilians.

　　特务蠢动毒我人民
    济源县府通令除奸
    【本报阳城讯】国民党军近派遣大批特务分子由孟县、垣曲、平陆等地河防潜入济源，到处大量投毒，无耻毒杀我解放区人民。本月七日以来，仅大社、石河、原昌三村，即有一百二十多人中毒。虽经太岳四分区卫生处派出大批医务人员赶往抢救，仍有四十余人因毒重致死。该县指挥部除对被难者家属进行慰问与生活照顾外，并已通令全县加强除奸防谍，彻查国特破坏分子。
    【本报冀南讯】国民党反动派为配合其内战阴谋，派遣特务潜入我解放区，进行各种破坏活动。临清武城等地不断发现特务案件。近据获案之国特分子郭士明（系国民党区分部委员）、刘祯等供称，特务目前发展口号是“面向农村，面向工农，整理组织，建立下层领导，成立联络站，扩大实力，待机暴动。”其活动办法：一、建立联络站，诱骗贿买无知青年及妇女当情报员，有计划的制造谣言。二、利用解放区的合法组织，成立互助组等，吸收各色人物参加活动。如对怕斗争的地主说：“参加我们的互助组吧！组织起来有了力量，村里就不敢斗咱们”。对贫农说：“你们整天忙着开斗争会，耽误好多工夫，将来也不准能分点东西，参加我们的组织保证给你几亩地种（由违法地主拿出地给贫农）。”三、各方贿买拉拢村干部及群运中的积极分子，引诱腐化，挑拨是非，破坏上级干部威信。四、利用各种封建教门，以“上天堂”“入地狱”的迷信宣传，进行特务活动，据供出的有：佛礼、仙坛会、圣贤道、青红帮、一贯道等封建教门，部分已被特务掌握利用。此案破获后，已引起我军民之严重警惕。
