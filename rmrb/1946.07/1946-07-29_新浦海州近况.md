Current Situation in Xinpu and Haizhou
    Obscenity and Plunder
    Taking Over Mistresses
    “Sister Wang the Fourth” was a famous courtesan in Xinpu in recent years. Her name was Wang Guifang, she is twenty-six years old this year, and Haizhou is her hometown. She had been the mistress of several puppet officials. Those she married included Zeng Tianlin, the puppet Guanyun County Magistrate, whom she married at the New World Hotel in Xinhai; Ma Ziliang, the puppet Shuyang County Magistrate; Wang Zhihu, the puppet Haizhou Commissioner; Libao, the captain of the Japanese Kempeitai; Jigeng, the squad leader of the Japanese Kempeitai; and the puppet Ganyu County Magistrate and the puppet Suqian County Magistrate, among others. Naturally, she ate well and dressed well, and even the living expenses of her married sister's family were maintained by her; in addition, she bought 500 mu of top-quality land in Antan.
    After the enemy surrendered, "Sister Wang the Fourth's" good fortune did not end. The 98th Army of the Kuomintang (now renamed the 53rd Division) came to Xinpu to "take over," and the army commander, Duan Linmao, also "took over" "Sister Wang the Fourth." She lived in a place with three or four sentry posts, drinking and playing cards all day long.
    After the 98th Army arrived in Xinpu, officers above the rank of company commander also "took over" new mistresses. Most of the prostitutes in more than ten brothels, such as "Haichang Shuyu" (the largest brothel in Xinpu) and "Hongxitang," became officials' mistresses; some people even sent their daughters or wives to officers of the 98th Army as "mistresses" in order to rely on the official power of the "National Army." These "mistresses" did not pay for bathing in the bathhouses, and the orderlies who came to the bathhouses also said they were looking for "mistresses." Besides the officers of the 98th Army, only these "mistresses" wore gold rings. Recently, the Political Training Department of the 98th Army recruited female political trainers, who were all escorted in hand-in-hand by regimental commanders, battalion commanders, and chiefs of staff. They were naturally confident in the exams, and those who passed were all "preparing to be mistresses." This is probably one of the glorious traditions of Chiang Kai-shek's army, or perhaps it is a case of superiors imitating their inferiors.

    Lots of Gold
    Very few of the cadres above the company and battalion commander level of the 98th Army of the Chiang army in Xinpu lacked gold and silver. Some even wore several gold rings on their hands, strung several gold rings on their belts, and used gold rings for gambling. Pan Zong, the secretary of the army headquarters, had three catties of gold stolen by his orderly, and a notice was issued for his arrest. Their engagement gifts were mostly goldware. In the past month or so, more than a dozen young women in Donghai and Xinpu, under the threat and enticement of money from the Chiang army, held weddings with officers above the rank of company and battalion commander of the stubborn army. Duan Zhongping, the company commander of the 351st Regiment (formerly the 11th Regiment) of the division, even forced Xu Mu'en, a female student of Haizhou Normal School, to get engaged to him, forcing Xu Mu'en to flee to her relatives' home, afraid to show her face. The company commander then took a few days off and told the Bao chief and the Xu family, "I have her photo. She came looking for me, not me looking for her." He also forcibly sent the Xu family tens of thousands of yuan in gifts, two taels of gold jewelry, and clothing and cosmetics. It caused a great stir in the city.

    Confiscation is a Hard Pass
    Under the active expansion of the civil war by the Chiang army in Xinpu, two sentry posts are occasionally placed on the west side of Xinpu, one checkpoint in Baozhuang, and plainclothes teams in Liuzhuang, making passing merchants as afraid as if they were facing living阎罗(Lord of Death). Merchants have to spend money to load and unload goods, otherwise they are "breaking the law" and cannot pass. Baozhuang is even more ferocious. One merchant, because he had no money, emptied his pockets but it was not enough. His pleas were in vain. Liuzhuang can also be said to be a "confiscation checkpoint." In June alone, Shen Li's family bought more than ten tubes of boiled green dyestuff, spending 1,500 legal tender, which was all confiscated in Liuzhuang. Enzeng, Feng Xianquan, and several merchants bought two barrels of kerosene and more than ten tubes of boiled green dyestuff. They spent 5,000 yuan each to pass through the two checkpoints in Xinpu, but in Baozhuang, more than 5,000 yuan were searched from several people, but the goods were still confiscated in Liuzhuang. Li Pan's family bought five catties of brown sugar and a "Da Chuan" (food for women who have just given birth), and 2,000 yuan legal tender was seized when she passed through Xinpu. Everything was confiscated in Liuzhuang. The woman knelt and pleaded in vain and was beaten. Zhao Tushi bought more than ten catties of alkali and it was also confiscated. Lin Furen and Shi Haoquan, a husband and wife, had two bicycles and 500 yuan in silver dollars confiscated in Wugou (east of Liuzhuang). The woman was taken to the Haizhou Special Service Company and detained for seven or eight days. She spent more than 300 silver dollars to bail herself out, but she was already sick and dying. Her husband hid in his relatives' house and dared not go out. He shivered when he saw the Chiang army and cried to people, "I have been ruined (robbed). I can only starve to death."

    Under the Civil War Situation
    At present, in the Xinpu, Haizhou, and Banpu areas under Kuomintang rule, every bridge, every intersection, both ends of every street, and both sides of the highway are built with bunkers and communication tunnels. The east and west gates of Haizhou City have been blocked, and firewalls have been built at the north and south gates, allowing only one person to pass through. The bunkers are surrounded by barbed wire, and the Yunji Mountains in front and behind are covered with dense electric wire. The electricity is turned on at night, and the trees on the mountains have been cut down. The people say that the New Sea under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries is a place where "there are more bunkers than houses and more ghosts than people."
    Since late June, the Chiang army has been conducting military exercises every day. On June 25, during an exercise outside the south gate of Haizhou, the Chiang army killed Guo, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 11th Regiment of the 4th Reserve Division of the 98th Army, two platoon leaders, one artilleryman, and eight soldiers due to the explosion of a shell. At the end of June, an exercise by the Chiang army in Xinpu also killed one company commander, seven platoon leaders, and one adjutant.
    As soon as Chiang Kai-shek issued the fifteen-day ceasefire order, he began to forcibly conscript young men from house to house. The Chiang army stationed in Haizhou City ordered each Bao to forcibly conscript thirty young men, and Bao chiefs and shop clerks were all required to undergo "military training." They even inherited the Japanese invaders' methods of rule, forcibly implementing grain "rationing," stipulating that each person was only allowed twelve taels per day, and each family was only allowed to store fifty catties of grain. Violators would be punished as "Eighth Route Army." Zhou Tian, the magistrate of Haizhou County, sent a large number of tax collectors to forcibly collect "donkey head taxes" of 500 yuan legal tender from the people who were forced to carry grain. The people carrying grain said with tears, "You want us to concentrate the food from our families and send it here, and you also want our money. You are clearly forcing us to die."
    In a square area of less than twenty li, with a population of no more than 100,000, there are actually six exiled county governments in the city of New Sea. Donghai, Guanyun, Su Lin, Fangning... The officers and soldiers and "civil servants" of the Chiang army's 4th Reserve Division and the puppet army's Commercial Patrol Headquarters, Salt Police, and Water Police Bureau are far more numerous than the common people. The common people still have to wear three "good citizen certificates" to live and pass through, just like in the enemy puppet era. Without them, they become "Eighth Route Army" and are in danger of being arrested, imprisoned, fined for labor, fined money, or even buried alive at any time. The Kuomintang reactionaries raise a large number of plainclothes agents who search day and night for "dissident elements," and each Bao has a "instructor" specifically to check whether the people have "colluded with bandits." Tang Dianchu, a resident of Punan Township, Dongji District, Guanyun, went to Banpu for medical treatment because he was sick. He was arrested by the puppet Commercial Patrol Headquarters because he did not have a "good citizen certificate" and was beaten half to death. He was extorted 250,000 yuan legal tender before he was released. The Wang Battalion Commander Building in Banpu is the base camp of the Chiang and puppet army agents in Banpu. Every day, dozens of innocent men and women are arrested and taken in. Tang Dianchu witnessed more than 100 innocent residents being brutally buried alive in mid-May within fifteen days. A nineteen-year-old girl was gang-raped by a group of "soldiers" and then put into a pit head first, with her embroidered shoes sticking out of the ground, and buried alive, while those gang-raping "National Army" members watched from the window of the "Wang Battalion Commander Building." The suffering people of New Sea are eagerly hoping for the New Fourth Army to rescue them.

　　新浦海州近况
    诲淫与劫掠
    接收太太
    “王四姐”是新浦近几年来有名的红妓女。她名叫王桂芳，今年二十六岁，海州是她的老家，她曾连做过好多次伪官的太太，和她结过婚的有伪灌云县长曾天林，在新海世界饭店结的婚；有伪沭阳县长马子良；有伪海州专员王志沪；有日本宪兵队队长立苞；有日本宪兵队班长屐野；还有伪赣榆县长和伪宿迁县长等人。她自然是吃的好，穿的好，就连她一个已出嫁的姐姐家的生活费也都由她维持；此外她还在安滩买了五百亩上等地。
    敌人投降后，“王四姐”的红运并未尽，国民党九十八军（现改名五十三师）开来新浦“接收”，军长段林茂也就把“王四姐”“接收”了。她住的地方站上三四道岗，终日吃酒打牌。
    九十八军到新浦以后，连长以上的军官也都“接收”到了新的太太。“海昌书寓”（新浦最大的妓院），“红喜堂”等十余家妓院的妓女，多半变成了官太太；也有人为了想靠“国军”的官势，而把自己的女儿或妻送给九十八军军官充做“太太”的。这些“太太”们到澡堂洗澡是不给钱的，来澡堂里的勤务兵也说是来找“太太”的。带金戒指的除了九十八军的官长以外，也只有这些“太太”。最近九十八军的政训处招考女政训员，都是由团长、营长、参谋长手搀手带进去，应考自然有把握，考取也都是“准备太太”。这大概是蒋介石军队的光荣传统之一，或者是上行下效。
    金子多
    新浦蒋军九十八军连、营长以上干部，没有金银的很少，甚至每人手上能带几个金戒指，裤腰带能串几个金戒指，赌钱也多是金戒指。该军部秘书潘宗，即有金子三斤被其勤务员拐跑，曾经通告捕拿。他们订婚聘礼大多是金器。最近月余，东海、新浦有些青年女子在蒋军的威胁和金钱的引诱下，与顽军连营长以上干部举行结婚的已有十几个。该师三五一团（原十一团）连长段仲平，更强迫海洲师范女生徐沐恩同他订婚，逼得徐沐恩逃到亲戚家不敢露面，该连长又请假几天，对保长同徐家放赖说：“我有她的相片，是她找我的，不是我找她的。”还硬送给徐家礼金数万元，金首饰二两，以及衣料化妆品等。闹得满城风雨。
    没收关难过
    新浦蒋军在积极扩大内战下，不时把新浦西头放两道岗，鲍庄一道关，刘庄还有便衣队，往来商旅畏若活阎罗。商人装货出进就得花钱，否则“犯法”走不通。鲍庄更凶，一位商人因无钱，掏尽腰包还不够，苦苦哀求也不顶事。刘庄也可以说是一个“没收关”。只六月里，如沈李氏，买煮青十余筒，花了法币一千五百元，到刘庄全被没收。刘恩增、冯宪全和几个商人，购煤油两桶，煮青十余筒，出新浦两道岗，各花五千元，到鲍庄，几个人身上五千多元被搜去，可是到了刘庄，货还是被没收。李潘氏买红糖五斤，及大川一部（产妇吃的），路过新浦被搜去法币二千元，到刘庄东西也全被没收，该妇跪求无效，还被打了一顿。赵土市买碱十余斤，也被没收。林福人和石皓全夫妇二人，两辆脚踏车和白洋五百元，在五沟（刘庄东）全部被没收，女人被解到海洲特务连押了七八天，花了三百多块白洋才保出来，但已经病得快死了，她丈夫躲在亲戚家里不敢外出，见蒋军就浑身发抖，对人哭着说：“坑了我（劫打了之意），我只有饿死了。”
    内战风云下
    目前国民党统治下的新浦、海州、板浦一带，每一座桥、每一十字街、每一条街道两端和公路两侧，都筑有碉堡和交通地道。海洲城东西两门被堵塞，南北两门筑起火线墙仅容一人通过，碉堡四周挂满铁丝网，在前后云吉山更密布电网，入晚即通电流，山上树木被砍得精光，老百姓说国民党反动派统治下的新海是“碉堡比房屋多，鬼比人多”。
    六月下旬以来，蒋军连日进行军事演习。六月二十五日海洲南门外演习时，蒋军因炮弹爆炸炸死了九十八军预四师十一团二营郭营长，排长二名，炮手一名，士兵八名。六月底新浦蒋军演习也炸死连长一名，排长七名，副官一名。
    在蒋介石发布十五天停战令开始即挨家强抽壮丁，驻海州城内蒋军勒令每保强征壮丁三十人，保甲长和商家店员一律要受“军训”。更承袭日寇统治办法，强迫实行粮食“配给”，规定每人每天只配给十二两，每家只准存粮五十斤，违者即以“八路军”办罪。海州县长周天更，派出大批征收员向强迫驮粮前去的人民，强行征收“驴头捐”法币五百元，送粮人民流着泪说：“要我们把家里口粮集中送来，又要我们钱，明明是逼死我们。”
    方园不足二十里，人口不过十万的新海，城内竟有六个流亡县政府。东海、灌云、宿麟、防宁……，蒋军预四师和伪军编成的商巡总队，盐警、水上公安局等，各部官兵和“公务人员”比老百姓多得多。老百姓仍然和敌伪时代一样，要挂三个“良民证”才能居住通行，没有就成了“八路”，随时都有遭受逮捕座监、罚工、罚金乃至活埋的危险。国民党反动派豢养着大批便衣特务，日夜搜捕“异党分子”，并在每保派有“指导员”专门检查老百姓有无“通匪”行为。灌云董集区浦南乡居民唐殿初，因生病去板捕求医，就因没有“良民证”被伪商巡总队捕去打得半死，勒索法币二十五万元才把他放回。板捕的王营长大楼，是板捕蒋伪军特务大本营，每天都有十几个到数十个无辜男女被抓进去，唐殿初目睹有一百多无辜居民，在五月中旬十五天内惨遭活埋。一个十九岁的姑娘，被一群“军人”轮奸后，还被放进坑里头朝下，花鞋露在外面活埋掉，而那些轮奸的“国军”却在“王营长下楼”窗口参观。苦难中的新海人民，正激动的期望着新四军去解救他们。
