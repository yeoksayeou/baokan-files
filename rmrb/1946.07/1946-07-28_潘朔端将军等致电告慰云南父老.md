They explained the course of the uprising and reported on the current situation of their troops. The telegram stated: "Shuoduan and others could not bear to see the Northeast, which had fallen into enemy hands for fourteen years, become a battlefield again, nor could they bear to see the sons and daughters of Yunnan, who had traveled thousands of miles, sacrificed in vain. Therefore, we launched an uprising in Haicheng, raised the banner of opposing civil war and striving for democracy, and joined hands with the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. Here, we are warmly welcomed and supported by the people. We are in good spirits and health. Please be relieved!"
