Demon Claws and Blood Shadows
    -- A Record of the Xiaguan Massacre in Nanjing

    "Their blood will not be shed in vain. It will receive its due price in the future peace and democracy movement. This is not just an assault and insult to the delegation, but an assault and insult to the people of Shanghai, to all sons and daughters of China. This is an unfortunate and bloody tragedy in modern China." -- Shanghai United Evening News, June 25th.

    At 11:00 AM on the 23rd, the Shanghai People's Delegation Against the Civil War, led by Ma Xulun and others, totaling more than ten people, boarded the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) train amidst the enthusiastic farewell of 200,000 people in Shanghai. At 5:00 PM, when the train passed Zhenjiang, they were surrounded, harassed, and insulted by a group of special agents and thugs. These special agents and thugs wanted to detain them in Zhenjiang and then "take care" of them. However, under the delegation's stern rebuke, these villains eventually climbed back onto the train in frustration.

    At 7:00 PM, the train arrived at Xiaguan Station. The Kuomintang authorities had already set a trap at the station to harm the petition delegation, prohibiting porters from boarding the train to carry the delegation's luggage, delaying their disembarkation. As soon as Mr. Ma and his party stepped onto the platform, a large number of special agents and thugs lying in wait surrounded them. Two special agents, claiming to be "representatives of refugees from Northern Jiangsu," came forward to make many absurd demands to the petition delegation. Ms. Hu Ziying, the delegation's secretary, said, "As long as the civil war in China is completely stopped, the refugees who have left their homes can return. ......" Before she could finish speaking, a barrage of curses erupted from all around, followed by a shout to attack from a burly man in black. This group of fascist beasts swarmed up and beat Mr. Ma and others with fists and feet.

    More and more special agents and thugs participated in the assault, while the police and soldiers, who were supposed to be "maintaining order" at the station, dwindled in number. The delegates retreated from the platform to the waiting room. Mr. Ma, weakened from the beating, sat on the sofa. The special agents and thugs tightly surrounded the waiting room, shouting loudly, "We must get the man named Ma out," "Down with Ma Xulun," "Down with Zhou Enlai," "Down with the Communist Party"...... The police and soldiers present also cooperated with the special agents and thugs, forcing Mr. Ma and his party to immediately return to Shanghai on the night train, which was firmly rejected by Mr. Ma and the others.

    Unable to bear it any longer, the delegation sent Mr. Yan Baohang, General Manager of Da Ming Company, to speak. The special agents and thugs shouted, "Don't listen!" and barked, "Kneel down!", "Communists, kneel down!" Mr. Yan said indignantly, "I fought the Japanese for several years, and I never knelt down under the Japanese knives and guns. I can't kneel. If you want to shoot me, then shoot me! ......"

    The sound of shouting to attack suddenly surged from the square at the station entrance. A group of fascist beasts were surrounding and beating several reporters who had come to cover the event. Among them were Gao Ji, a reporter from Ta Kung Pao; Pu Xixiu, a female reporter from Xinmin Evening News; Xu Bin, a reporter from Yi Shi Bao; and Xu Shinian, a reporter from Da Gang Bao. The special agents shouted, "Beat that woman," "That man is no good either," and swung their fists and feet wildly at them.

    Gao Ji and Pu Xixiu broke out of the encirclement and turned to the waiting room. At this time, Dai Youling, an employee of the Ta Kung Pao's Xiaguan distribution office, arrived, wanting to rescue Gao Ji from danger. As soon as Gao Ji walked out of the waiting room with him, they were surrounded again, and under the punches and kicks, they had to retreat back to the waiting room.

    Qian Jiangchao, a specialist from the Municipal Government's Information Office, rushed to the station upon hearing the news and contacted the leaders of the assault to release the reporters. The leader agreed, and Gao and Pu followed Qian Jiangchao out of the station. However, they were surrounded and severely beaten by special agents and thugs again in the square. Qian Jiangchao was not spared either.

    A truck full of military police drove to the station, and Gao and Pu took the opportunity to try to break through the encirclement again and return to the waiting room, but they had already been beaten three times. This group of military police who arrived were ordered to stand scattered far from the waiting room. They were so "calm," as if they had not seen the petition delegation surrounded in the waiting room at all.

    It was 11:00 PM, and the waiting room was still heavily surrounded. Mr. Ma and the others were in an even more precarious situation. There were more and more special agents and thugs, fewer and fewer police and soldiers. In the end, only one military policeman was left near the waiting room "observing the situation." Then another round of vicious beatings began. The special agents and thugs rushed into the waiting room amidst shouts to attack. Another group broke the glass windows of the waiting room and jumped in. They picked up tables, chairs, benches, and other objects as weapons and beat Mr. Ma and the others severely.

    Mr. Ma Xulun, a 62-year-old man, was beaten on the head, chest, and waist, suffering serious injuries. Mr. Yan Baohang was covered in injuries, especially on his face. Ms. Lei Jieqiong was hit hard on the head with a wooden stick and kicked in the chest with leather boots. Chen Zhenzhong suffered serious injuries to the head and chest. Other petition delegates were also beaten. The reporter Ma Ji suffered the most serious head injury, with blood streaming down his face and his right eyeball protruding. A large chunk of Pu Xixiu's hair was pulled out, and she was beaten in the waist, chest, and head. Ye Duyi, a representative of the Nanjing Democratic League delegation sent to the station to welcome Mr. Ma and the others, was also seriously injured. All the injured had their clothes torn and were covered in blood.

    While being beaten, the pens, watches, and cash that Mr. Ma and the others were carrying were all looted by the special agents and thugs. When Lei Jieqiong was beaten unconscious, a group of special agents and thugs swarmed forward, vying to snatch a leather bag she was holding in her hand (containing more than 100,000 yuan in cash). One bandit, because she was holding it very tightly, actually bit off a piece of flesh from her hand and then snatched the bag away.

    Ms. Lu Zhi, a female employee of the Nanjing Bank of China, who was at the station on official business, was also surrounded and beaten by this group of fascist beasts, and the clothes on her body were torn to shreds. Later, she borrowed a long gown from an old woman before she was able to leave the station and return home.

    This group of fascist bandits beat them from 7:00 AM until midnight. Finally, after several hours of tortuous negotiations by representatives of the Democratic League and the Communist Party, and the efforts of Feng Yuxiang, Li Jishen, and others, a group of military police finally arrived from the city at a leisurely pace. When this group of military police arrived at the station, instead of searching for and arresting the special agents and thugs, they wanted to "invite" the peace petition delegates to the military police headquarters. Of course, they knew that some of the delegates had already suffered very serious injuries. After the delegates argued strongly on the basis of reason, they were spared this "invitation" and were escorted to the hospital.

    The blood of the people's representatives will not be shed in vain. The fascist bandits' attempt to suppress the anti-civil war movement by force has failed. The nationwide demand for peace is even louder.

### 魔爪血影——记南京下关惨案

　　魔爪血影
    ——记南京下关惨案
    “他们的血是不会白流的，它将在未来和平民主运动里，得到应有的代价，这不只是对代表团的殴打和侮辱，而是对上海人民，对整个中华儿女们的殴打和侮辱。这是现代中国的一件不幸的流血惨案。”——六月二十五日沪联合晚报语。
    二十三日上午十一时，沪市各界人民反对内战晋京请愿代表马叙伦等十余人，在二十万群众的热烈欢送下，搭着京沪车，由沪起程了。下午五时车过镇江，他们就被一批特务暴徒包围、留难、辱骂。这批特务暴徒想把他们扣留在镇江，然后“收拾”他们。但在代表们的严词斥责下，这批宵小之徒，终于悻悻的爬上车去了。
    下午七时车抵下关车站，国民党当局已在车站上布置好残害请愿团的陷阱，禁止挑夫们上车去搬运代表们的行李，阻延他们下车的时间。等到马氏一行下车踏上月台，预伏在站上的大批特务暴徒，立刻将他们团团包围，有两个自称“苏北难民代表”的特务，出面向请愿团提出许多荒谬的要求。请愿团秘书胡子婴女士说：“只要中国国内战争彻底停止，离家的难民就可以回家了。…………”话犹未了，四周骂声大起，跟着一个穿着黑衣的彪形大汉一声喊打，这批法西斯野兽就一拥而上，拳足交加将马氏等一顿殴打。
    参加行凶的特务暴徒愈来愈多，而照例在车站上“维持秩序”的宪警，却变得寥寥无几了。代表们由月台上退到候车室。马先生被打得有气无力的坐在沙发上，特务暴徒把候车室严加包围，大声叫着“非叫姓马的出来不行”，“打倒马叙伦”，“打倒周恩来”，“打倒共产党”……………。在场的宪警亦配合特务暴徒强迫马氏一行，立刻乘夜车返沪，当为马氏等严正拒绝。
    代表团看不下去了，派大明公司总经理阎宝航先生出来讲话，特务暴徒高喊：“不要听”并狂吠“跪下来”，“共产党跪下来！”阎氏愤慨的说：“我和日本人打过几年仗，在日本人刀枪下我也没有下过跪，要跪办不到，要枪毙枪毙好了………………”。
    喊打的声音突然从车站门口的广场上涌起了，一群法西斯野兽在那里包围与殴打着前来采访的几个记者。里面有大公报记者高集，新民报女记者浦熙修，益世报记者徐斌，与大刚报记者徐士年四人。特务们叫着，“打那个女的”，“那个男的也不是好东西。”拳脚向他们乱挥。
    高集和浦熙修两人从重围中冲了出来，转到了候车室里。这时大公报下关分销处职员戴有龄赶到，想拯救高集出险。高集刚跟他走出候车室，又被包围起来，在拳打脚踢之下，只得再退回候车室。
    市政府新闻处专员钱江潮闻讯赶到车站，和行凶头子接洽，放记者出去。头子答应了，高浦二人便跟着钱江潮出站。但是走到广场上又被特务暴徒围住痛殴，钱江潮也未幸免。
    一辆满载宪兵的大卡车开到车站，高浦两人就趁机再图突围，重返候车室，但已被打了三次。这一批开来的宪兵，奉命分散的站在距离候车室很远的地方。他们是这样的“镇静”，好像根本没有看见请愿团被围在候车室里。
    深夜十一时了，候车室仍被重重包围。马氏等的处境更加险恶，特务暴徒愈来愈多，宪警愈来愈少，最后在候车室附近只剩一个宪兵在那里“观阵”了。于是再一次的凶殴又开始了。特务暴徒在喊打声中，冲进了候车室，其他一群是打破了候车室内的玻璃窗而跳进去的。他们拿起桌椅板凳等作为武器，向马氏等痛殴。
    六十二岁的马叙伦老先生，头部胸腰部均被殴，受伤甚重。阎宝航氏遍体鳞伤，面部最重，雷洁琼女士头部受木棍重击，胸部被皮靴踢伤。陈震中头部胸部均受重伤，其他请愿代表亦多被殴打。记者马集，头部伤最重，血流满面，右眼球突出，浦熙修头发被扯去了一大把，腰部、胸部、头部都挨了打。南京民盟代表团，派赴车站欢迎马氏等的代表叶笃义，亦被打重伤，所有受伤诸氏，衣服都被撕烂，满身血污。
    在被打时，马氏等身上所带的钢笔、手表、及钞票等物，都被特务暴徒一抢而光。当雷洁琼被打昏时，一群特务暴徒都拥上前，争着抢劫她手中所握的一个皮包，（内藏钞票十余万元）有一个匪徒因她握得很紧，竟用嘴咬掉了她手上的一块肉，然后将皮包抢走。
    南京中国银行女职员路芝女士，因公前往车站，亦横遭这群法西斯野兽围住殴伤，身上衣服竟被撕得一丝不挂。后来向一老姬借得长衫一件，才得离站返寓。
    这批法西斯匪徒自上午七时一直打到夜半十二时。最后在民盟与中共代表经数小时之转辗交涉，及冯玉祥、李济深等氏的努力，好容易才有一批宪警从城里姗姗而来。这批宪警到了车站，他们不去搜捕特务暴徒，倒想把和平请愿的代表们“招待”到宪兵司令部去。当然他们知道代表们中间有几个伤势已经非常严重，经过各代表据理力争，才算免了这一“招待”，而被押送到医院里去了。
    人民代表的血，不会白流的，法西斯匪徒想用武力，把反对内战运动镇压下去的企图，是失败了。全国人民要求和平的声浪是更加高昂了。
