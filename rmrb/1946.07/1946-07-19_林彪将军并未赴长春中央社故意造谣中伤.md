Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 15th. Recently, the Kuomintang Central News Agency has continuously reported the so-called news of General Lin Biao meeting with Du Yuming in Changchun, and fabricated facts, saying: "Originally scheduled for the 11th, then a notification was received to change it to the 13th, but unexpectedly the Communist army broke the appointment again..." And from this drew the conclusion: "It is doubtful whether the Communist army is sincere," and so on. For this reason, this agency's reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the Democratic Allied Forces headquarters to inquire about the truth. According to reports, "On the 5th of this month, when Brigadier General Tian Bomen visited General Lin in Harbin, he invited General Lin to meet with Du Yuming in Changchun. General Lin immediately expressed his willingness for such a friendly meeting, and as for the appropriate date for the meeting, it would be decided later through consultation." After the meeting between Generals Lin and Tian, they each received Chinese and foreign reporters and made statements accordingly. Now, General Lin is busy with affairs and his health is not good, and the doctor has advised him not to travel far, so he has specially sent Mr. Li Minran as a representative to thank General Tian Bomen and visit Mr. Du Yuming. The above facts are sufficient to prove that the Central News Agency's claim that General Lin Biao agreed to go to Changchun on the "10th" and "13th" is purely fabricated, and the statement that "it is doubtful whether the Communist army is sincere" even more exposes its purpose of creating such rumors to deliberately slander.

　　林彪将军并未赴长春中央社故意造谣中伤
    【新华社哈尔滨十五日电】近日国民党中央社连续报导所谓林彪将军与杜聿明于长春会晤消息，并捏造事实谓：“原订于十一日，嗣又接获通知，改于十三日举行，不料共军又告失约……”。并由此得出结论：“共军是否有诚意，令人怀疑”云云。为此，本社记者特走访民主联军司令部负责人探询真相，据称：“本月五日田博门少将来哈访问林总司令时，曾邀请林将军赴长与杜聿明会晤，林总司令当即表示甚愿此种友谊的会晤，至于会晤之适当时日，以后电商决定”。林、田两将军晤谈后，曾分别招待中外记者，均照此发表谈话。现林总司令因事忙及身体欠佳，医生劝阻远行，故特派李敏然氏为代表前往答谢田博门将军，并访问杜聿明氏。上述事实，足证中央社所谓林彪总司令答应于“十日”与“十三日”赴长春之说，纯系捏造，而“共军是否有诚意令人怀疑”云云，更暴露其造作此种谣言之目的为有意中伤。
