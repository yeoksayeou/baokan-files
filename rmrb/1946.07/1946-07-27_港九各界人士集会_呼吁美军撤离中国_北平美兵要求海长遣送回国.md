　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Hong Kong: On June 30th, compatriots from Hong Kong and Kowloon held the "Conference of People from All Walks of Life in Hong Kong and Kowloon to Promote the Motherland's Peace Movement" at the Cathay Theatre in Hong Kong. More than 2,000 people participated, including people from cultural circles, students, and the broad masses of workers and merchants. The conference elected He Xiangning, Peng Zemin, Qian Jiaju, Chen Cisheng, Di Chaobai, and representatives from all walks of life, Wang Wenxiong, as members of the presidium. Mr. Peng Zemin, an elderly gentleman of seventy, delivered a speech on behalf of the presidium, saying: "The more than 2,000 people present are enough to represent hundreds of thousands of compatriots from Hong Kong and Kowloon, who urgently hope to achieve comprehensive peace immediately and unanimously oppose the civil war." Mr. Peng said, "We demand that our American friends not provide unilateral aid to China before the establishment of a democratic coalition government in China, and withdraw American troops stationed in China." Mr. He Xiangning called on people from all walks of life to rise up and strive for peace. Mr. Chen Cisheng, representing the Southern Headquarters of the China Democratic League, said: "Peace and democracy are inseparable. If it is a democratic country, the people do not want to fight wars. How can a civil war be fought? Because politics is not democratic, dictators disregard the lives and deaths of the people and want to fight a civil war." Mr. Qian Jiaju pointed out that the basic reason for the civil war is one-party dictatorship and personal autocracy. Representatives from the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, Zhu Jingzhi, Wang Zhixiong, and others, shouted even louder: "If a civil war breaks out, workers and merchants will have an even harder time!" Finally, the conference passed telegrams to Chairman Mao, Chiang Kai-shek, and Marshall, and expressed condolences to Mr. Ma Xulun and others. The meeting lasted for three hours before adjourning.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: After Madam Soong Ching Ling condemned the Sino-American reactionaries and urged the United States to stop military supplies, according to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 23rd: "The Kuomintang-controlled newspapers did not mention Madam Soong's statement at all. Other newspapers only published excerpts. Ta Kung Pao only published the first sentence of the Associated Press report on the statement. Foreign newspapers in Shanghai published the full text. Madam Sun's suggestion to establish a coalition government and stop American military supplies is expected to strengthen the position of the CCP and the Democratic League, because they insist on the same things. The Madam has a great influence and status in China. … American newspapers all published Madam Sun Yat-sen's statement on the front page, and emphasized her argument that "the Sino-American reactionaries are indeed trying to involve the United States and the Soviet Union in a new world war through the Chinese civil war."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: When US Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, who visited China earlier this month, went to Peiping on the 7th, many American soldiers stationed in Peiping frankly requested to return home. For this reason, Forrestal stayed for one day, holding cocktail parties and banquets, respectively, to entertain some soldiers of the Marine Corps in Peiping. According to an Associated Press report from Peiping on the 8th: "According to the Marine Corps soldiers who attended the meeting, they frankly asked Forrestal to return to the United States. One soldier asked when the US Marine Corps would withdraw from China. Forrestal replied that he did not know, and then asked the soldier what would happen if the US Marine Corps withdrew from China. Forrestal repeatedly stated when answering soldiers' questions that he did not want to say more. Forrestal was quite concerned about the details of the US military guarding the North China Railway."

    【新华社延安二十二日电】香港讯：港九侨胞于六月三十日在香港国泰戏院举行“港九各界促进祖国和平运动大会”，参加者两千余人，包括文化界、青年学生和广大工人、商民等各界人士。大会选出何香凝、彭泽民、千家驹、陈此生、狄超白及各界代表王文雄等人为主席团。七十高龄的彭泽民老先生代表主席团致词说：“在座两千多人，足以代表几十万的港九侨胞，迫切的希望立即实现全面和平，一致反对内战。”彭老先生说：“我们要求美国朋友在中国民主联合政府未成立之前，勿作单方面的援华，并撤退驻华美军”。何香凝先生号召士农工商学起来争取和平。代表民盟南方总支部的陈此生先生说：“和平与民主是分不开的，如果是民主的国家，老百姓都不要打仗，内战怎么能打起来，因为政治不民主，所以独裁者不顾人民的死活要打内战”。千家驹先生指出内战的基本原因，就是一党专政与个人独裁。农工商界代表朱敬之、王之雄等更大声疾呼：“内战打起来，工人与商人更没有日子过了”。最后，大会通过分致毛主席、蒋介石、马歇尔电，及慰问马叙伦等先生。会议经三小时始散。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】美国通讯社报导：宋庆龄氏谴责中美反动派及促敦美国停止军事供给声明后，据美联社上海二十三日电称：“对宋氏的声明，国民党控制下的各报根本不提，其他报纸则仅仅摘录发表，大公报只登载了美联社关于该声明报导的第一句话，上海之外国报纸则登载其全文。孙夫人建议成立联合政府，停止美国军事供给，预料此一声明将加强中共及民盟之地位，因为他们坚持要求同样的东西。夫人在华有很大之影响与地位。……美国各报，俱以首页刊登孙中山夫人的声明，并强调其论点谓：“中美反动派的确企图经过中国内战，将美国与苏联卷入新的世界战争”。
    【新华社延安二十三日电】月初访华之美海军部长福莱斯特，于七日赴北平时，驻平美军多人曾坦率要求返国。为此，福氏曾勾留一日，设鸡尾酒会及宴会，分别招待在平美陆战队部分士兵。据美联社北平八日电报导：“据与会之陆战队士兵称，彼等曾向福氏坦白要求返美，某兵问美陆战队何时撤离中国，福氏答不知，旋反问该兵，认为美陆战队如果退出中国，将有何种事情发生。福氏数度于答复士兵之问话时，谓渠不欲多言。福氏颇关切美军卫护华北铁路之详情。”
