　　Kuomintang Officials Embezzle Relief Supplies
　　Jixian People Rise Up in Resistance
[Our newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] A large batch of UNRRA relief supplies arrived in Jixian County, a Kuomintang-controlled area, on May 9th. All of the supplies were embezzled by the Kuomintang authorities, and the masses did not receive a single item, arousing infinite anger among the peasants inside and outside the city. More than 600 people spontaneously organized and petitioned the Kuomintang government of Jixian County, directly questioning County Magistrate Du Xiyao, "Where have the relief supplies gone?" Why can't the disaster victims get anything to eat? Unexpectedly, Du not only did not admit his mistake but also cursed the masses. Enraged, the masses tore County Magistrate's clothes and threw them on the ground. Seeing that the situation was not good, Du had to promise to distribute a portion immediately. At that time, some tattered clothes, worn leather shoes, and a small amount of legal tender were distributed to the masses, and the masses left reluctantly. Subsequently, five to six hundred people from the Second City Gate and villages outside the city successively petitioned the county government, cursing along the way, "Foreigners donate money and clothes to relieve Chinese disaster victims, and you officials take them and replace the good ones with bad ones, and you don't even distribute the bad ones to the disaster victims, but only to your mothers, relatives and grandfathers." Along the way, more and more people gathered, and a woman whose husband had starved to death in the famine year, leaving behind four children who could not work, cried on the spot, saying: "My family of five has no food or clothes, and I haven't received a single bit of relief supplies." The masses also angrily cursed: "You bloodsuckers, you even swallow the money and clothes donated by foreigners." Now the masses resolutely demand that the embezzlers be punished and the relief supplies be recovered, and the resistance struggle in all villages throughout the county has erupted like a raging fire.

　　国民党官独吞救济物资
　  汲县人民愤起反抗
    【本报长治讯】联总大批救济物资，五月九日运抵国民党统治区之汲县，悉数被国民党当局贪污中饱，群众一物未得，激起城内和城外农民无限愤怒。自动结合六百余人向汲县国民党政府请愿当面责问县长杜希尧，“救济物资到那里去了？”为啥灾民挨不上吃？讵料该杜某毫不认错反而破口大骂群众，在群怒之下群众将县长衣服撕破，摔在地下，当时杜某见势不好只得允诺立即发给一部分，当时即发给群众一些破烂衣服，三等夫皮面，和少数的法币，群众始悻悻而去。接着第二城关与城外各村五六百群众陆续到县政府请愿，沿途大骂“外国的老百姓捐钱衣服救济中国灾民，你们当官的拿了去用坏的换上好的，连坏的还不发给灾民，只发给你娘亲舅爷。”沿途群众越来越多，当场有个丈夫在灾荒年饿死，而留下四个不能作活孩子的女人，当场大哭说：“我一家五口无饭吃无衣服，一点儿救济物资都未领到”。群众也愤怒的骂：“你们这些喝血鬼，连外国捐来的钱和衣服你们都吞了。”现群众坚决要求处分贪污分子追回救济物资，全县各村的反抗斗争已经如火如荼的暴发起来。
