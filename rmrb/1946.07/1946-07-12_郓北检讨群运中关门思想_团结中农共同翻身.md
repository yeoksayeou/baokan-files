[Heze News from This Newspaper] In the seventh district of Yunbei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, after the anti-traitor movement in May and June, the organized masses only accounted for one-ninth of the total population. The vast majority of middle peasants have not yet joined the farmers' association. The reasons for this are: First, there is a lack of education among the leadership, which has led some poor peasants to have feelings of excluding middle peasants, believing that middle peasants are all well-off and not hungry, and cannot be of one mind with poor peasants. Second, leading cadres have thoughts of "poor peasants first, middle peasants later," "emphasizing poor peasants, slighting middle peasants," and even "not wanting middle peasants." They only approach poor peasants and do not approach middle peasants. Middle peasants do not understand government policies and harbor doubts. Third, after the movement achieved initial results and farmers' organizations were established in various villages, cadres became complacent, their work style gradually became less in-depth, and they did not seriously understand the emotions and demands of the broad masses, especially the middle peasants. They did not adequately recognize the importance of "organizing the majority." Based on the above review, the district has decided that in the future, it will intensify its efforts to go deep into the masses in various villages to understand the demands of the broad middle peasants, publicize and explain our policy of rewarding labor and wealth, educate middle and poor peasants with the idea that "laboring peasants are one family," mobilize middle peasants to participate in the struggle against traitorous bullies and landlords, distribute the fruits of the struggle to middle peasants, absorb outstanding and resolute middle peasant activists as cadres, and jointly lead the mass struggle, and develop the vast middle peasants into members of the farmers' association in the struggle.

　　郓北检讨群运中关门思想
　  团结中农共同翻身
    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫郓北七区，经过五、六月份的反奸运动，组织起来的群众只占全人口九分之一，广大中农，还没有参加农会。其原因，一是领导上缺乏教育，致使部分贫农有排斥中农情绪，认为中农都是好户，不饿肚，和贫农不能一心。第二是领导干部中存在着：“先贫农、后中农”，“重贫农、轻中农”、甚至“不要中农”的思想。只接近贫农，不接近中农，中农不了解政府政策，怀着疑虑。第三、在运动获得初步成绩、各村农民组织建立之后，干部发生自满情绪，作风渐不深入，不去认真了解广大群众特别是中农的情绪与要求，对“组织多数”的重要性认识不够。该区根据以上检讨，确定今后要加紧深入到各村群众中去了解广大中农要求，宣传解释我们奖励劳动发家的政策，以“劳动农民是一家”的思想教育中农、贫农，发动中农参加对奸霸地主斗争，分配斗争果实给中农，吸收优秀与坚决的中农积极分子当干部，共同领导群众斗争，在斗争中发展广大中农为农会会员。
