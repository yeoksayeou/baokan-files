Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: A tragic incident of Kuomintang troops massacring students occurred in Xifeng Town (under Qingyang County, Gansu Province) in the Kuomintang-controlled area of eastern Gansu on the 16th of last month. The director of instruction at Xifeng Normal School and over 40 students were injured, and many are missing. On the morning of the 16th of last month, Xifeng Normal School held a graduation ceremony and performed a play on the school's playground. More than 20 officers and soldiers from the 83rd Regiment of the 8th Division of the garrison were also present. At that time, the sun was blazing, and a student surnamed Chen was wearing a straw hat, obstructing the view of the military officer. The officer threw the straw hat to the ground. When the student surnamed Chen questioned him, the officer responded with a slap in the face, which aroused the anger of the students, and they drove the officer out of the theater. In the afternoon, during the performance, the officer brought more than a hundred soldiers to surround the school, and more than a hundred plainclothes soldiers mixed into the school. An officer went on stage and ordered an attack. The soldiers below immediately brandished hand grenades, rifles, and bayonets, and indiscriminately attacked the students. Doors, windows, and tables and chairs flew at people's heads. More than 40 people were injured on the spot. Director Ma of the Teaching Department and more than a dozen students were seriously injured, and four or five students are missing, and their whereabouts are still unknown.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 15th: People in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces have risen up to oppose the collection of grain as tax in kind. The Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial Council has telegraphed the councils of various provinces in southwestern China, urging them to unite in opposing the authorities' collection of military grain. The council believes that the War of Resistance has ended, and the government has explicitly ordered the exemption of grain collection in kind. Now that the Yunnan army is moving out in large numbers, there are no military affairs to speak of, and no military grain is needed. Secondly, Yunnan has suffered heavy burdens during the War of Resistance, and the people are exhausted. Moreover, disasters have occurred in various parts of Yunnan, and they are unable to save themselves, let alone endure this harsh treatment. Furthermore, the fellow-countrymen associations in Chengdu from various counties of Sichuan Province also held a joint meeting in the latter half of last month, deciding to telegraph the people of the whole province to oppose borrowing and collecting in kind. At the same time, provincial councilors from various counties and cities stationed in Chengdu also submitted a firm resolution to the provincial government, requesting that the Kuomintang authorities implement their promise to exempt this year's land tax.

    川滇人民反对征收军粮
    【新华社延安十四日电】陇东国民党区西峰镇（甘肃庆阳县属），于上月十六日发生国民党军惨杀学生惨案，西峰师范教导主任及学生四十余人受伤，多人失踪。上月十六日上午，西师举行毕业典礼，并在该校操场演戏，驻军第八师八十三团官兵二十余人亦在场。当时正烈日当空，一陈姓学生头戴草帽，遮着该军官视线，该军官将草帽掷地，陈姓学生质问时，该军官答以耳光，遂引起学生气愤，将该军官驱逐出戏场。下午演戏时，该军官带来一百多士兵包围学校，并有一百多便衣军人混进学校，一军官登台叫打，台下士兵即挥动手榴弹、步枪、刺刀，向学生乱打，门窗桌椅飞向人头，当场受伤四十余人，教导处马主任及十数学生伤势甚重，并有四五个学生失踪，至今不知下落。
    【新华社重庆十五日电】滇川两省人民纷起反对田赋征实。云南省参议会驻会委员会顷通电西南各省参议会，一致起来反对当局征收军粮。该会认为抗战业已结束，政府已明令免除田赋征实，现滇军纷纷开拔，已无军事可言，无需军粮。其次云南经过抗战时期之重大负担，人民已疲惫不堪，且云南各地灾象已成，自救不暇，更何能受此苛扰？又川省各县旅蓉同乡会也于上月下旬举行联席会议，决定通电全省人民，反对征借征实。同时驻蓉各县市省参议员亦以硬性的决议，送呈省府，转请国民党当局实行免征本年度田赋的诺言。
