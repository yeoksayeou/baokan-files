　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling’s recent statement condemning the collaboration between Chinese and American reactionaries in expanding the Chinese civil war has aroused attention from all sectors in the United States. According to a US News Agency dispatch from Washington, the US State Department, through its spokesperson on the 23rd, issued a commentary in response. The commentary did not directly address Madame Sun’s demands for the withdrawal of US troops stationed in China and the cessation of arms and military aid to the Chinese authorities before the establishment of a representative democratic coalition government in China. The US State Department spokesperson stated, "The United States' policy towards China has been determined for some time and will not be changed."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: According to a US News Agency report, several American radio commentators have given very positive reviews of Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling's remarks. Mutual Broadcasting System commentator Sid said, "When Madame Sun speaks, let the whole world listen attentively!" Among all the women in China, no one has received such tremendous respect from hundreds of millions of Chinese people; even Madame Chiang Kai-shek is not as respected as she is." Ivey Davis stated on the American Broadcasting Company, "American planes, warships, and other supplies were originally intended for an army of a united China, but it seems they have rewarded the Kuomintang for launching a war. Therefore, the protests of Madame Sun and liberal educators and journalists can be said to have some significance."

　　孙夫人谴责中美反动派
    已引起美国各方面注意
    【新华社延安二十五日电】孙夫人宋庆龄女士日前谴责中美反动派狼狈为奸扩大中国内战之声明，引起美国各方面的注意。据美新闻处华盛顿电：美国务院为此特由其发言人于二十三日发表评论，该评论对孙夫人所提出的撤退驻华美军，在中国代议性民主联合政府建立前停止对中国当局之军火及军事援助等要求，均未作正面的答复。美国务院发言人称：“美国对华政策已确定多时，决不加变更。”
    【新华社延安二十五日电】据美新闻处报导：若干美国无线电评论家，对孙夫人宋庆龄女士之谈话有极好评论。互助广播系统评论家希德称：“当孙夫人讲话时，让全世界洗耳恭听吧！”在全中国妇女之中、没有任何女性能够获得中国数万万人民如此巨大的崇敬，就是蒋夫人也不如她。”艾维玛戴维思在美国广播公司致词，他说：“美国飞机、战舰和其他供给品，原是给一个团结中国之军队，但是似乎它们已奖励国民党用以发动战争。因此孙夫人和自由派教育家与新闻记者的抗议，可以说是含有若干意义的。
