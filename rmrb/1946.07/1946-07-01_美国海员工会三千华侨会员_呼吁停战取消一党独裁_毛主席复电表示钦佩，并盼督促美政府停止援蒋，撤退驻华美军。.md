Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: Shanghai dispatch: Three thousand overseas Chinese members of the U.S. Seafarers International Union recently sent a telegram to Madam Soong Ching-ling to be forwarded to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Kuomintang Government, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Democratic League, calling for an end to the civil war, the abolition of one-party dictatorship, and the realization of peace and democracy. The original telegram is as follows:

To Madam Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai, to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government, Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Zhang Lan of the Democratic League: The three thousand overseas Chinese members of the U.S. Seafarers International Union demand an immediate end to the Chinese civil war based on the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and the realization of peace and reconstruction in China. We abhor the use of Japanese puppet troops and U.S. troops in the civil war. We believe that unprecedented corruption must be eradicated, one-party dictatorship must be abolished, and replaced by a democratic coalition government. The American labor movement will do everything possible to support a democratic, free, and independent China. Signed, Kwongsaich (transliteration)

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 25th: Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, replied on the 24th to Mr. Kwongsaich and the three thousand overseas Chinese workers of the U.S. Seafarers International Union. The full text of the reply is as follows:

Mr. Kwongsaich and the three thousand overseas Chinese workers of the U.S. Seafarers International Union:

Having received your telegram, I have learned that you are calling for an immediate end to the Chinese civil war, the abolition of one-party dictatorship, and the establishment of a democratic coalition government. You have also expressed righteous indignation against the act of conducting civil war by relying on foreign forces. Your concern for the future of the motherland and your love for peace and democracy are admirable and inspiring! I deeply hope that you will continue your efforts to awaken all overseas Chinese in America, the entire American labor movement, and people from all walks of life, to demand that the American authorities immediately cease all aid to the Kuomintang dictatorial government, withdraw U.S. land, sea, and air forces stationed in China, and withdraw the proposed bill submitted to the U.S. Congress for continued military aid to China, so that China's peace and democracy can be realized at an early date, and the traditional friendship between China and the United States can be maintained.
