　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: New Delhi Dispatch: The All-India Committee of the Indian National Congress, on the 7th, by a vote of 204 to 51, passed the resolution of the Congress Committee of June 26th, namely, opposing the British interim plan and accepting the long-term recommendations. The proposal was put forward by Gandhi. Asad stated at the meeting: "The British, in view of the strength of the Indian national movement, have had to seek an agreement with the Indians. The British have agreed to India's demand that the Indian constitution must be drafted by its own representatives." At this meeting, Nehru formally took over the post of Congress President. In his first speech to reporters on the 10th after taking office, he stated: "The Congress Party is not prepared to accept any treaty imposed on India by Britain, or Britain's attempt to permanently maintain vested interests in India. We can only accept treaties based on the principle of equality between Britain and India." The next day, Nehru, speaking on the future of Pondicherry, a French colony in India, expressed his hope that the area would be returned to India through a self-determination process. The so-called interim plan opposed by the Congress refers to the issue of establishing an interim government, including the organization and powers of the interim government.

　　印度国大党决定
    拒绝英国临时计划
    尼赫鲁正式接任该党主席
    【新华社延安十三日电】新德里讯：印国大党全印委员会七日以二○四票对五一票，通过六月二十六日国大党委会的决议，即反对英国的临时计划，而接受长期建议。该案系由甘地提出。阿沙德于会上称：“英人因鉴于印度民族运动力量之强大，不得不与印人谋取协议。英人已答应印度之要求，即印度宪法须由印人自己的代表制订。”在此次会上，尼赫鲁正式接任国大主席职，他于十日的记者会上发表上任后的首次谈话称：“国大党不准备接受英国强加于印度的任何条约，及英国欲在印度永久保持既得利益的企图。我们只能接受基于英印平等基础的条约”。次日尼赫鲁谈到印度法属殖民地本地治里的前途问题时，表示希望该地经自决程序归还印度。按国大反对的所谓临时计划，系指成立临时政府问题，包括临时政府之组织及权力。
