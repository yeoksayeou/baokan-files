　　Telegrams of Condolences from Various Places to Comrades Released from Prison in Xinjiang
    Regaining Freedom is a Victory for the Entire Party and the People of the Whole Country
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th] Comrades in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and various liberated areas welcomed the comrades released from Xinjiang back to Yan'an with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy. The General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, after the arrival of the 129 released comrades in Yan'an, immediately sent Comrades Zeng San, Deng Jie, Zhang Qinqiu, Zhang Zhongshi and others to express their condolences, and brought with them a letter of condolences from all the comrades of the organization, which stated: "You were imprisoned and executed by executioners in Xinjiang. Those who lived were unyielding, and those who died regarded death as going home. This is a typical example of the fine qualities of communists. You are worthy of being a member of Mao Zedong's team, and worthy of being a student of Mao Zedong. For six years, we have not forgotten you for a single day, and we firmly believe that you will regain your freedom one day. Your righteousness and unyieldingness have made this belief a reality today. This is a victory achieved through the struggle of the entire Party and the people of the whole country. At present, the motherland is facing a new national crisis. We deeply hope that you will recover your health as soon as possible and work together to save the new disaster of the motherland." The Central Bureau of the Jin-Cha-Ji Branch of the Communist Party of China, in its telegram of condolences to the comrades released and returned to Yan'an, stated: "We are delighted to hear that you have arrived in Yan'an safely. We congratulate you on the victory of your heroic struggle with infinite excitement, and we firmly believe that with the addition of such a large number of strong leaders and backbones who have been tested and tempered, the great cause of peace and democracy of the Chinese people will surely be victorious. We wish you a speedy recovery from your wounds under the comfort of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao." The Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions said in its telegram of condolences: "Your heroic struggle has finally broken the chains on your bodies and restored the freedom to fight alongside the people. We extend our warm congratulations. At the same time, we will not forget that there are still many 'political prisoners' living in dark prison lives, especially Comrades Chen Tanqiu and Mao Zemin, who were arrested in Xinjiang. We demand that the Kuomintang authorities immediately find out the whereabouts of Comrades Chen and Mao and release them immediately."
