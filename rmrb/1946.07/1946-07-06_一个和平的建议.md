　　A Peaceful Proposal
    By Pú Bèi'ěr
    Editor's Note: Mr. Pú Bèi'ěr is a senator from Florida, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the current chairman of the American Bar Association. Mr. Pú is a fervent supporter of the late President Roosevelt's international cooperation policy and has actively supported President Roosevelt's legislative proposals to promote American war efforts, aid the United Nations, and create lasting peace.
    While soldiers who went off to war have not all returned home, people are already talking about war again. This situation is caused by absolute patriotism, the vanity of imperialism, the remnants of isolationism, warmongers, and fascist leaders.
    There is no need to elaborate here on the measures taken by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to strive for security guarantees. The United States is attempting to monopolize the atomic bomb, seeking military bases around the globe, and considering implementing conscription. Britain's manpower and resources, apart from economic construction, really cannot afford to be wasted any further. However, it maintains a powerful navy and army along its old imperial lifeline. The Soviet Union's efforts are even more of a source of sensational news in newspapers and on the radio. It has personally experienced the horrors of war, unlike Britain and the United States, which were fortunate enough to escape unscathed. The Soviet Union is strong today, but after experiencing the pain of yesterday, it looks to the future with unease. It is suspicious, but we cannot say that its doubts are unfounded. Its historical demands for warm-water ports have been rejected, its demands for the establishment of friendly people's governments in neighboring countries have been obstructed, and its applications for negotiated loans have been shelved. In their minds is a series of tragic historical memories of counter-revolution, foreign intervention, conspiracies, and boycotts, which make them feel that in a world controlled by "Cartel" bosses, imperialists, or anti-Soviet elements, they will not receive a genuine welcome.
    Before discussing ways to break through the web of fear and suspicion, let us first offer a "warning against three dead ends": The first dead end is nationalism, isolationism, or unilateralism. Today, no country is strong enough to achieve security alone, even if it has "sufficient army, superior navy, and overwhelming air force" (Senator Connally's words). I would even say, add to that the incredibly powerful atomic bomb. The second dead end is a tough policy armed with atomic bombs, but the major powers are not easily deterred. They will have even more vicious weapons, and the arms race will therefore never end. The third dead end is the division of spheres of influence, the formation of separate blocs, or the maintenance of political maneuvering... These are all historical relics and will not be revived today—no matter how beautiful a name is added to this temporary combination of interests between great powers, such as "philanthropic group."
    Finally, it must be said with some regret that under the current circumstances and leadership, the United Nations organization is not a solution to eliminate fear. The basic principle of the "United Nations" is the unity of the three powers. It is an association of sovereign states, not a state within a state, or a world government. In order to safeguard the sovereignty of each country, there is a provision for the veto power, and the veto power makes the unity of the three powers a prerequisite for the "United Nations" to function.
    The Security Council's handling of the Iranian issue proves this analysis. If the three powers recognize the "United Nations" as a debate venue where everyone can refute each other, then the "United Nations" can never effectively work in resolving the security issues of the three powers. Without the unity of the three powers, the "United Nations" cannot function. Before this foundation is stable, it is a foolish act to rigorously test the function of the "United Nations."
    Therefore, I believe that the only way to break out of the "web of terror" is to thoroughly implement President Roosevelt's great idea—building the unity of the three powers and the "United Nations organization." I believe that the path for the United States to peace is to strengthen the unity of the three powers. To achieve this goal, I have suggested immediately convening a meeting of the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. In addition to regular diplomatic personnel, the meeting should include representatives of the people of the three countries. Only in this way can it truly express the will of the people of the three countries to strive for peace and the importance of the issue. I feel that people like General Eisenhower of the United States, Marshal Zhukov of the Soviet Union, and General Alexander of Britain should all be invited to participate because their successful cooperation after the war will arouse everyone's respect and confidence. Other representatives should include business, labor, farmer leaders, women, and veterans.
    The scope of the meeting should be to restore mutual trust between the three powers and to establish basic agreements on various military, economic, and political issues. Its purpose is not to replace the "United Nations," but to do some preparatory work for the Security Council and the "United Nations" General Assembly. The United States bears the greatest responsibility for the success of this meeting. Therefore, the United States does not need to blame Britain and the Soviet Union, but only to consider its own obligations. The United States must present a clear and practical new diplomatic policy at the meeting—an international cooperation program based on the needs of the people and the desire for peace. This program must include the following policies:
    (1) Axis countries—The United States must ensure that Germany and Japan do not rise again to wage war. All disarmament, eradication of Nazism, dissolution of "Cartels," and re-education work must be thoroughly implemented. (2) Atomic energy—Only fools would think that certain powers monopolizing atomic energy can obtain a stable and secure world. The United States must propose a law that all individual facilities for manufacturing atomic energy should be destroyed, and representatives of the Security Council have the right to supervise the implementation of this provision in all countries. At the same time, all institutions researching atomic energy should be placed on an international scientific basis and become the common property and servant of mankind. Some more cautious or suspicious people may think that this suggestion is a useless fantasy, but I want to tell him that this is a method that is of the utmost importance to the implementation of peace. The people who created the atomic bomb told us long ago that the atomic secret cannot be kept for long. Therefore, if my proposal is not implemented, what will replace it is an endless atomic arms race, resulting in a war that will hurt both sides. Only when all countries are involved in the atomic secret and all countries recognize the atomic bomb as illegal can we all have security. If the world can simultaneously conduct universal peaceful research, then atomic energy will greatly improve human security, prosperity, and happiness. (3) Strategic bases—The United States must adopt a policy that advocates the joint occupation by members of the Security Council of land, sea, and air bases outside the territory of each country. The United States cannot hope that the Soviet Union will be contained within the circle of US military bases, just as it cannot hope that the Soviet Union will be frightened by the atomic bomb. Britain and the United States must realistically recognize the fact that the Soviet Union will not acquiesce to the unlimited hegemony of Britain and the United States over the oceans and all strategic locations. Of course, every country that maintains a base feels that its security is impaired when it is asked to hand over the base, but if all countries can hand over their bases to the Security Council, then everyone will obtain more security than individually maintaining bases. (4) Sharing of raw materials—The United States must be prepared to implement the provisions of the Atlantic Charter regarding the universal enjoyment of necessary raw materials by all countries. I don't know how the great powers would feel if they could develop Mexican oil fields while the United States alone was excluded. The history of the United States is full of precedents for using diplomatic and military intervention for economic development. The acquisition of Middle East oil mines is the result of power politics. The Saudi Arabian oil mine, which has the second-largest reserves after the United States, is now the property of two American companies. The vast oil fields in Iran are in the hands of the British, so is it surprising that the Soviet Union is now demanding oil fields in northern Iran bordering its own country? If we demand peace, we must have fair and peaceful ways for all countries to share the strategic needs and not universally available raw materials in the modern world. (5) Colonies—The United States must lead the reform of the colonial system. The colonial issue involves the sharing of raw materials, but more importantly, it is related to the core issues of democracy and freedom in the new world. If we allow countries that have recently been liberated from Nazi servitude by the blood and property of the American people to immediately become oppressors of other people, we will truly be ashamed of the dead and embarrassed to face the living. Upon the request of the people of the colonies, the mandates of the old League of Nations should be revoked immediately. If they are not yet independent, they should be designated to be managed by the United Nations Trusteeship Council. The only way to peacefully resolve the Middle East issue is for the great powers to withdraw their troops and place Palestine under the Trusteeship Council. (6) Economic cooperation—The above five points are all related to security, but economic cooperation is no less important for restoring mutual trust. To ensure security, the United States, which owns half of the world's industry after the war, must take the lead or be prepared to make the greatest sacrifices. Unless the United States uses its unprecedented financial and industrial power to supply huge export trade, it will not be able to achieve full employment—without full employment, democracy cannot truly grow in the United States. Without the help and support of the United States, the world cannot restore its destroyed economy. For this dual goal, the United States must adopt a generous foreign loan policy. The danger of economic isolationism to the United States is no less than that of political isolationism. If the people's lives are not satisfactory or unstable, there is no real security in the international community. Refusing to grant countries loans for legitimate and repayable purposes after the war is equivalent to refusing to provide Lend-Lease aid to the Allies during the war. Refusing to grant loans to Britain is a foolish idea. A prosperous Britain is needed for a prosperous world and a prosperous United States. The same is true for loans to the Soviet Union, France, and China.
    To make this meeting a success, the representatives must have a new level of thinking and a new attitude. We need to be enthusiastic about promoting international cooperation and understand that nothing has influenced American foreign policy more than Senator Vandenberg last year. Because the problems we face now are related to war and peace, we have to go back to the time when Hitler's power was growing, and this senator from Michigan did not fulfill his task as a national outpost. When he rebukes the Soviet Union today, he may understand in his heart that no matter how fair he wants to be, the Soviet Union will not forget that three months before the German army invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, he still voted against the United States using the Lend-Lease Act to aid the Soviet Union.
    In 1940, we heard American isolationists and nationalists shout that the two oceans were a guarantee of American security. Today, we hear American new isolationism and new nationalism advocate that the atomic bomb is enough to make the United States do whatever it wants. Today's new nationalism seems to pay attention to the effective military control of atomic energy. Vandenberg is the main supporter of these policies. Unless he convinces us that he has abandoned the fortress of isolationism, I feel that Vandenberg will hardly be able to effectively support the policy of international cooperation, thereby achieving world peace.
    Today, war is not caused by a single major decision. It is the accumulation of many minor decisions that ultimately makes war inevitable. The formation of war is step by step, one mistake plus another mistake, one incorrect judgment following another incorrect judgment, until the cannons start firing, then it is too late! We can only eliminate war by actively and aggressively striving for peace because peace is based on the brotherhood and sovereign equality of the people of the world, as well as the need for peace and happiness of mankind.

### 一个和平的建议

　　一个和平的建议
    泼贝尔  作
    编者按：泼贝尔为美国佛罗里达州参议员，参院外委会的委员，现任美国律师公会主席，泼氏为故罗斯福总统国际合作政策的热烈拥护者，曾积极支持罗斯福总统关于促进美国作战努力，援助联合国，缔造永久和平之一切立法议案。
    在出征战士尚未全部解甲归乡的时候，人们已在再度谈论战争。造成这种情形的，是绝对爱国主义、帝国主义的虚荣、孤立主义的残余、战争煽动者和法西斯头子。
    美英苏三国对争取安全保障的措施，这里无庸细述。美国企图独霸原子弹，寻觅围绕全球的军事基地，考虑实行征兵。英国的人力和资源，除经济建设外，实已不能再有所浪费。但它沿着古老的帝国生命线，维持了强大的陆海军。苏联的努力，更是报纸及无线电耸人听闻的新闻来源，它是亲尝过战争恐怖的，不似英美得幸免于难。苏联今日是强大了，但在经历昨天的痛苦之后，它不安的望着将来，它是多疑的，但我们不能说它的疑虑没有根据。它对不冻港的历史性要求被拒绝，它对邻接国家建立友好人民政府的要求被阻挠，它对谈判贷款的申请被搁置，在他们心里的是反革命、外国干涉、阴谋、抵制等一连串悲剧史的回忆，使他觉得在一个为“卡迭尔”老板、帝国主义者或反苏分子所控制的世界里，它不会受到真正的欢迎。
    在讨论冲破恐惧和猜疑之网的出路之前，我们先提出对于三条“死路的警告”：第一条死路是：国家主义、孤立主义或片面主义，今天没有一个国家强大到足以单独达到安全，即使它有“充足的陆军，优越的海军及压倒的空军”（参议员康纳利语）。我甚至于可以说再加上威力惊人的原子弹。第二条死路是：强硬政策以原子弹当武装，但各强国不是很容易吓退的，他们会有更凶的武器，军备竞争因之将无已时。第三条死路是：势力范围区划，各自结成集团，或者保持纵横捭阖，……这些都已是历史的陈迹，今天不会再复活了——无论把这种列强之间暂时利害的结合，加上如何动听的名词，如“博爱集团”。
    最后或要颇带遗憾地说：在目前的时间环境及领导之下，联合国机构不是消除恐惧的办法。“联合国”的基本原则，是三强的团结一致，这是主权国家的联合，不是国中之国，或者世界政府。为维护各国主权，所以才有否决权的规定，而否决权又使三强团结成为“联合国”能够工作的先决条件。
    安全理事会处理伊朗问题的经过，证明了这种分析。如果三强认“联合国”为一辩论场所，大家可以互相对驳，则“联合国”在解决三强安全问题中，绝不能有效的工作。没有三强团结，“联合国”不可能运用。在这个基础尚未稳固之前，便来严格考验“联合国”的功能，是一种愚蠢的举动。
    因此我认为冲出“恐怖之网”的唯一办法，是彻底实行罗斯福总统的伟大思想——建设三强团结及“联合国机构”。我认为美国走向和平的道路，便是加强三强的团结。为实现这个目的，我曾建议立即召开一个英、美、苏三强政府领袖会议，除正规外交人员外，参加会议的应该包括三国人民的代表，只有这样，才能真正表示三国人民争取和平的意志以及问题的重大。我觉得像美国的艾森豪威尔元帅，苏联的朱可夫元帅，及英国的亚历山大将军，都应该被召参加，因为他们会后成功地合作，将引起大家的尊重和信心。其他的代表应包括商人、工人、农民领袖，妇女及退伍兵士。
    会议的范围应该是恢复三强之间的互信，成立各种军事经济及政治问题的基本协议。它的目的并不是取“联合国”而代之，它是为安全理事会及“联合国”大会，做一点开路的工作。美国对这一会议的成功，负有最大的责任，因此美国不必责备英苏两国而只是考虑本身的义务，美国必须在会议上拿出一个明晰实用的新外交政策——一个以人民须要及和平愿望为主的国际合作方案，这种方案须包括下列各项政策：
    （１）轴心国——美国必须保证德日两国不至再起作战，一切解除武装、根绝纳粹、解散“卡迭尔”及再教育工作须彻底实行。（２）原子能——只有傻子才会觉得某些强国独霸原子能能得到一个安定安全的世界，美国必须建议一种法律，一切单独的关于制造原子能的设备应予以摧毁，安全理事会的代表有权监督所有国家执行这种规定，同时一切研究原子能的机构应置于国际科学基础之上，成为人类的共同财产和仆人。有些比较谨慎或多心的人，会认为这个建议是无用的空想，但我要对他说，这是对实行和平有至大关系的办法。创造原子弹的人早对我们说过，原子秘密是不可能长久保持的。因此如果不实行我的建议，那末代之而起的是无休止的原子军备竞走，结果是两败俱伤的一场战争。只有一切国家都与闻原子秘密，一切国家都认原子弹为非法，我们全体才有安全。假使全世界能同时进行普遍的和平的研究，那末原子能必能大大提高人类的安全富足和快乐。（３）战略基地——美国必须采取一种政策，主张安全理事会会员国联合占领各国本土以外的海陆空基地，美国不能希望苏联被防制于美军基地圈之内，正如它不能希望苏联被原子弹吓住相同。英美必须现实地认识这个事实，即苏联不会默认英美无限止地雄霸海洋及一切战略要地。当然每一个保有基地的国家，如要它将基地缴出，便觉得安全受了妨碍，但如果所有国家都能把基地交给安全理事会，则大家所得的安全必较个别保有基地更多。（４）原料的分享——美国必须准备实行大西洋宪章中关于各国普享必要原料的规定，我不知道假使列强能开发墨西哥油田，而美国独向隅它的感觉将如何。美国历史上不乏运用外交军事干涉以为经济发展的前例，中东油矿的取得便是强权政治的收获。储量仅次于美国的沙特阿剌伯油矿，现在是两个美国公司的产业。在伊朗广大的油田在英国人手里，那末现在苏联要求伊朗北部和它本国接壤的油田是值得惊奇的吗？如果我们要求和平，我们必得有公允而和平的方法，使各国都能在现代世界中分享战略需要及并不普遍的原料。（５）殖民地——美国必须领导改良殖民地制度，殖民地问题牵涉到原料的分享，但更重要的是它和新世界中民主和自由的核心问题有关。假使我们容许最近才由美国人民的鲜血和财产从纳粹奸役中解放出来的国家立即变成其他人民的压迫者，我们真是愧对死者，耻见生者。经殖民地人民的要求，旧国联的委任统治应即撤消，如尚不能独立，应指定由联合国托管理事会管理。和平解决中东问题的唯一办法，是列强一律撤兵，将巴勒斯坦置于托管理事会之下。（６）经济合作——以上五端皆有关安全，但经济合作之于恢复互信之重要性不减，确保安全这一点上，战后拥有全世界工业之半的美国，必须担任领导，或准备作最大的牺牲。美国除非把它空前的财政工业力量用以供应巨大的出口贸易，不足以实现全民就业——没有全民就业，民主在美国便不能真正生长。世界如没有美国的帮助和支持，也不能恢复破坏的经济。为了这个双重目标，美国必须采取一个宽大的国外贷款政策。对美国经济的孤立主义，其危险性正不下于政治的孤立主义。如果人民生活不满意或不安定，国际间便无真正的安全可言。战后拒绝对各国作用途正当且力能偿还的贷款，等于在战时拒绝对盟国作租借法案的援助。拒绝对英贷款是愚蠢的想法，一个繁荣的英国，对一个繁荣的世界和繁荣的美国是需要的。对苏、法、中的贷款亦然。
    使这个会议成功，代表们须有一个新的思想程度，一个新的态度。我们需要热心于促进国际合作，及了解他们去年对美国外交政策有影响的，莫过于参议员范登堡。由于目前我们面对的问题关系和战，我们不得不回想到在希特勒势力潜长的时候，这位来自米西根州的参议员，并没有达成作为国家前哨的任务。当他今天斥责苏联的时候，他心里也许明白：无论他想要做得如何公正，苏联不会忘记在德军于一九四一年进侵苏联之前三个月，他还投票反对美国对苏援用租借法案。
    一九四○年，我们听到美国的孤立派和国家主义派，高喊两洋为美国的安全保障，今天我们听到美国的新孤立主义和新国家主义，主用原子弹足使美国为所欲为。今天的新国家主义，似乎注意到原子能的军事上有效控制，范登堡是这些政策的主要支持人。除非他使我们相信他放弃了孤立主义的堡垒，我觉得范登堡是决难有效地支持国际合作的政策，从而取得世界和平的。
    今天战争不是由一个单一的主要的决定所造成，它是许多次要决定日积月累终使战争不可避免。战争的形成，是一步一步的，一个错误加另一个错误，一个不正确的判断随着另一个不正确判断，直到大炮开始轰击，那时便太晚了！我们只有积极地进取地为和平努力，战争才能消除，因为和平基于全世界人民的兄弟之谊和主权平等，以及人类的需要和平幸福。
