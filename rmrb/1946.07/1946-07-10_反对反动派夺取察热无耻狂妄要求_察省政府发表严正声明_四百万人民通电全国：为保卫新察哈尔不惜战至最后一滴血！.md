Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 6th: Regarding the unreasonable demand by the Kuomintang authorities for the Eighth Route Army to withdraw from the provinces of Jehol and Chahar, the Chahar Provincial Government has issued a solemn statement. It begins by stating: "We firmly oppose the unreasonable demand by the Kuomintang authorities to attempt to seize the liberated areas of Jehol and Chahar. This demand fundamentally violates the will and interests of the people of all ethnic groups in Chahar Province. General Zhou Enlai's stern rejection of this unreasonable demand is indeed a wise measure supported by the people of all ethnic groups throughout the province." The statement continues: "Ever since 1934, the Kuomintang authorities have already forfeited Duolun and a large area of eastern Chahar territory. Fortunately, the Eighth Route Army of the Chinese Communist Party advanced behind enemy lines and fought bravely, recovering vast territories of Chahar Province. Last autumn, the Eighth Route Army liberated the entire territory of Chahar Province. The great achievements of the CCP and the Eighth Route Army have been warmly supported by the people of all ethnic groups throughout the province. Yet, the Kuomintang authorities have actually made the unreasonable demand that the Eighth Route Army withdraw from Chahar, and their arrogance and shamelessness have reached their peak." The statement firmly expresses "the determination to fight to the end to defend the interests and peaceful democracy of the people of all ethnic groups in Chahar"! To this end, mass organizations of Chahar Province, representing the four million people of the entire province, have sent a telegram to the entire country, stating: "In order to defend the democratic freedom and happiness of New Chahar, we will fight to the last drop of blood."

　　反对反动派夺取察热无耻狂妄要求
    察省政府发表严正声明
    四百万人民通电全国：为保卫新察哈尔不惜战至最后一滴血！
    【新华社宣化六日电】为国民党当局提出八路军退出热察两省之无理要求事，察哈尔省政府特发表严正声明，首称：“我们坚决反对国民党当局企图夺取热察解放区的无理要求，该项要求根本违反察省各族人民之意志与利益。周恩来将军严正拒绝该项无理要求，实乃全省各族人民拥护之贤明措施”。声明中继称：“溯自民国二十三年后，国民党当局即已葬送察省多伦及察东大块国土。幸有中国共产党八路军挺进敌后英勇作战，收复察省广大国土，去年秋八路军解放察省全境，中共与八路军丰功伟绩，深受全省各族人民热烈拥护。而国民党当局竟提出要八路军退出察哈尔之无理要求，其狂妄与无耻可谓达于极点。”该声明中坚决表示“决为保卫察哈尔各族人民之利益与和平民主而奋斗到底”！察省各群众团体为此特代表全省四百万人民向全国发出通电，称：“我们为着保卫民主自由幸福的新察哈尔，不惜战至最后一滴血”。
