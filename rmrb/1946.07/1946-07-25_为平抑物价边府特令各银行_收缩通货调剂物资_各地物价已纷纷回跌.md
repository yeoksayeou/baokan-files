[Report from our Handan Office] Under the influence of the Kuomintang reactionaries' instigation of civil war, prices in our region have risen sharply in recent months. A few merchants and publicly-owned stores who do not understand the greater good have taken the opportunity to hoard and profiteer. The Border Government specifically issued an order on July 15 to the Jinnan Bank, Ruihua Bank, and local silver firms, suspending commercial and organizational troop production loans, contracting the currency, and releasing some materials to regulate the market. It also pointed out that future banking business should focus on supporting and lending to industrial, transportation, and cooperative enterprises. In recent days, prices in various regions have fallen significantly. Taking Handan as an example, on the 17th, wheat fell from 48 yuan to 40 yuan per jin, millet fell from 47 yuan to 39 yuan per jin, homespun cloth fell from 1,500 yuan to 1,300 yuan per jin, cotton fell from 550 yuan to 470 yuan per jin, and white cloth fell from 31,500 yuan to 27,500 yuan per bolt. Afterwards, they gradually stabilized. The Handan Taxation Bureau has been expanded into the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, with Deputy Mayor Feng Yujiu concurrently serving as the director and Zhang Ruogu, head of the Construction Section, serving as the deputy director, in order to more effectively control prices in Handan, develop the economy, and prosper the market.

　　为平抑物价边府特令各银行
    收缩通货调剂物资     
    各地物价已纷纷回跌
    【本报邯郸讯】在国民党反动派发动内战的影响下，本区数月来物价上涨甚猛，少数不明大义的商人及公营商店，更乘机囤积渔利。边府特于七月十五日下令冀南银行、瑞华银行及各地银号，暂停商业与机关部队生产贷款，收缩通货，抛出一部物资，调剂市场，并指出今后银行业务，应着重工业交通运输合作事业之扶植贷款。日来各地物价已纷纷回跌，以邯郸为例，十七日麦子每斤从四十八元跌至四十元，小米每斤从四十七元跌至三十九元，土布每斤从一千五百元跌至一千三百元，棉花每斤从五百五十元跌至四百七十元，白洋布每匹从三万一千五百元跌至二万七千五百元。以后渐趋平稳。邯市税务局已扩充为工商局，由副市长冯于九氏兼任局长，建设科长张若谷任副局长，以便更有效的掌握邯市物价，发展经济，繁荣市场。
