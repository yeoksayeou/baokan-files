　　Remembering the Central Plains Liberated Area

The second issue of the *Wen Cui* weekly, published in May in Beiping, contains an article titled "Remembering the Central Plains Liberated Area." It provides a vivid and detailed report on the democratic construction of the Central Plains Liberated Area and the economic construction of the army and people fighting against natural disasters. The article begins by describing the history of creating the Central Plains Liberated Area, stating: "The CCP's Central Plains Liberated Area was created by Yang Xuecheng from Huangpi County with seven broken guns after the enemy occupied Wuhan. Later, Li Xiannian, commander of the Fifth Division of the New Fourth Army, brought a team with seventy broken guns, only twenty of which could fire. That's how they established the 'Central Plains Liberated Area'. Before the Japanese surrender in August last year, the Central Plains Liberated Area was at its peak, with ninety-two counties, over fifteen million people, and 330,000 square li of land... After seven months of civil war, the Central Plains Liberated Area now has only twenty-two counties, over three million two hundred thousand people, and 100,000 square li of land."

Regarding the political construction of the Central Plains Liberated Area, Li Shi, Director of the Education Department of the Central Plains Liberated Area Administrative Office, stated in Hankou at the end of March: "We universally implemented three-level elections as early as 1941. At that time, Ms. Smedley and Ms. Anna Louise Strong from the United States went to see the election process in person as reporters. According to Smedley's evaluation, it was "very democratic." The author then mentioned the administrative achievements of the Central Plains Liberated Area, citing the words of Mr. Yang Xianqing, an 82-year-old from Huang'an County: "I don't care about other things, but the fact that doors are not locked at night in the liberated area is something I've never seen in my life." The author stated: "The common people's perception of the Central Plains Liberated Area has also gradually changed. Around 1940, they called it the 'New Fourth Army Government,' later shortened to 'New Government,' and some even called it 'Our Government'." Finally, the author's observation is: "Under the Communist Party's Three-Thirds System, many of the councilors and officials in the Central Plains Liberated Area are local gentry from Hubei. There are many old men in their fifties and sixties, and even an 80-year-old county magistrate. They are the 'brains' of the local people, and their enthusiastic participation in the administrative work of the Central Plains Liberated Area has a great impact on the hearts of the people and young people."

Speaking of the economic construction of the liberated area, the author stated: "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were many disasters in Hubei Province. For example, in 1941, there was a severe drought in the Xiaogan County area, and no grass or trees grew... The Central Plains Liberated Area carried out construction work in response to this situation. They knew that the survival of the people was their survival, and their democratic government could only solve economic difficulties if the people were prosperous." The author continued to point out that when the people of Anying District (Anlu...Yingshan) put forward the slogan of "repairing ponds and dams" in the spring of 1943, they organized the people and provided loans to them. As a result, more than 20 ponds were repaired under the work competition. When the drought came, the people were fully mobilized to decided to rush-plant yellow millet. The people also put forward the slogan "Grab the millet, don't grab the bags; grab the bags, don't grab the seedlings!" Everyone's waterwheels were connected in a line, and more than 160 large waterwheels drew water day and night. Everyone's strength rescued the yellow millet in the entire district, defeating hunger and death.

Drought is the enemy of the people of Hubei, but floods in the Honghu area of eastern Hubei are an even greater threat. The author recorded the overcoming of these difficulties and the people's reactions as follows: "After the Central Plains Liberated Area established political power here, the first step was to repair rivers and build dikes. Famous dikes often stretch for dozens of miles. This work ensured that Jianli County was completely free from flooding the year before last and last year. The people commemorate them. When they withdrew at the end of last year, the gentry, merchants, and common people cried and sent the commissioner away." Regarding this matter, an elderly councilor of the liberated area said: "Everything fair is in the hearts of the people!" (Xinhua News Agency)

　　记中原解放区
    北平版五月出的《文萃》周刊第二期，载有《记中原解放区》一文，对中原解放区的民主建设及军民与灾荒作斗争的经济建设，有生动详实的报导，该文开始述说创造中原解放区的历史称：“中共中原解放区，是在敌人侵占武汉之后由黄陂县一位叫杨学诚的倡导下，以七条破枪干出来的。后来新四军第五师师长李先念带来了一支队伍，这支队伍带来了七十条破枪，其中只有二十条可以打的响，就是这样，他们建立起了“中原解放区”。中原解放区在去年八月日寇投降之前最兴盛的时候，有九十二个县，一千五百余万人口，有三十三万方市里的土地………，经过七个月的内战，现在中原解放区只剩下二十二个县，三百二十余万人口，十万平方市里的土地了。”
    关于中原解放区的政权建设，三月底中原解放区行政公署教育处长李实在汉口谈称：“我们在一九四一年就普遍的实行三级选举，那时候，美国的史沫特莱女士、安蛾女士，以记者的资格，实地去看选举情形。据史沫特莱的评语是“很民主”。作者接着说到中原解放区的施政成绩，他举一位黄安县八十二岁的杨显卿老先生的话：“别的事我不管，解放区内夜不闭户，是我一生中第一次遇见的事。”作者称：“老百姓对中原解放区的观感，也是有一个逐渐的变化，一九四零年左右，他们称之为“新四军政府”，后来简称为：“新政府”，再后来有的叫“我们的政府”。最后作者的观感是：“在共产党的行政三三制原则下，中原解放区的议员、官吏有许多是湖北当地的士绅，五六十岁的老头子是多得很，还有八十岁的老县长，这是一批当地老百姓的“头脑”他们热心参加中原解放区的行政工作，是在老百姓及青年人的心中起着一种很大的影响的。”
    说到该解放区的经济建设时，作者称：“抗战期间在湖北省内有过不少的灾难，例如一九四一年孝感县一带大旱，草木不生…………中原解放区针对着这一情况来进行建设工作，他们知道老百姓的生存就是他们的生存，老百姓富庶了他们的民主政府才能解决经济困难。”作者继续指出当一九四三年春天安应区（安陆……应山）老百姓提出“修塘坝”的口号时，他们就组织老百姓，贷款给老百姓，结果在工作竞赛下修了二十多个塘，………跟着旱灾来了，老百姓全体动员决定抢种黄谷，老百姓又提出了口号“抢谷不抢包，抢包不抢苗！”大家的水车连成线，一百六十余部大水车日夜不断的拉水，大家的力量抢救了全区的黄谷，战胜了饥饿与死亡。
    旱灾是湖北人民的仇敌，鄂东洪湖地区水灾却是更大威胁，这些困难的克服，及人民的反映，作者是这样记载的：“中原解放区在这里建立了政权之后，第一步是修河筑堤，有名的大堤往往延绵数十里，这一个工作使监利县一带，前年去年全免水灾，老百姓纪念着他们，当他们在去年底撤退的时候，士绅、商人、老百姓痛哭着送专员离境。关于这件事一位年老的解放区参议员说：“一切的公道自在人心！”（新华社）
