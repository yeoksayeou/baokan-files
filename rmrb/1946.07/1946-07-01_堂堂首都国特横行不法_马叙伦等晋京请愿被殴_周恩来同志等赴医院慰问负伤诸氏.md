Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th. In Nanjing's Xiaguan Railway Station, the capital city, a shocking bloody incident occurred the night before last, in which a large number of Kuomintang secret agents and thugs surrounded and beat Ma Xulun and other representatives of people's organizations from Shanghai who were petitioning in Beijing against the civil war. Simultaneously with the 50,000-strong mass anti-civil war parade, people's organizations in Shanghai sent representatives Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang, Lin Handa, Sheng Pihua, Zhang Jiongbo, Lei Jieqiong, Bao Dasan, Chen Zhenzhong, and others, more than ten in total, to Beijing by train on the morning of the 23rd. They planned to petition the Kuomintang authorities and Marshall and others, demanding a long-term cessation of the civil war and the realization of comprehensive peace, demanding that the United States not interfere in China's internal affairs, that U.S. troops stationed in China withdraw immediately, and that all military aid to the Kuomintang government be stopped. More than 50,000 people from all walks of life went to the railway station to see them off, shouting slogans such as "Oppose the Civil War." After learning about Ma and others' petition in Beijing, the Kuomintang reactionaries immediately fabricated two "organizations," the "Shanghai Students' Anti-Civil Unrest League" and the "Shanghai Workers' Anti-Civil Unrest League," and issued statements through the Central News Agency, falsely accusing Ma and others of "masquerading as popular opinion" as a propaganda prelude to harming Ma and others. At the same time, they dispatched more than a thousand secret agents and thugs to wait for Ma and others to arrive in Beijing to carry out violence. When Ma and his party arrived at Nanjing's Xiaguan Railway Station at 7 p.m. that night, Wang Bingnan, representative of the CCP delegation, Ye Duyi of the Democratic League, and representatives of democratic organizations went to welcome them. Unexpectedly, as Ma and his party got off the train and were about to leave the station, Kuomintang secret agents and thugs lurking in the station swarmed forward, surrounding Ma and his party in the station, shouting abuse and insults at Ma and others. At that time, Yan Baohang stepped forward to explain the purpose of their trip, which was to oppose the civil war. The secret agents and thugs shouted "beat them!" and grabbed Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang, and others and beat them severely. Some of the secret agents and thugs lurking outside the station also broke windows and entered, joining in the brutal beating, resulting in Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang, Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, and other representatives, as well as Gao Ji, a reporter from Ta Kung Pao, Pu Xixiu, a reporter from Xinmin Pao, and others, more than ten people in total, being injured. After the incident, the secret agents and thugs roared away, and Ma and others were taken to the Central Hospital for treatment by car, by which time it was already midnight. It is reported that Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, Gao Ji, and others were the most seriously injured. Ma and others were surrounded and brutally beaten by secret agents and thugs at the station for a total of five hours, while the Kuomintang military police at the station stood by and watched. It was not until the secret agents and thugs had finished their violence that some military police came belatedly. After this bloody incident, all circles in Beijing and Shanghai were greatly indignant. Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, and others of the Nanjing CCP delegation rushed to the Central Hospital at 2 a.m. that night to express sympathy to the injured.
