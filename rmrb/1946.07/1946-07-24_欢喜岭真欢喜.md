Happy Ridge is Truly Happy
Happy Ridge Was Not Happy
Happy Ridge is a town located north of Suihua County in Heilongjiang Province. The Numin River surrounds it, and the surrounding area consists of fertile black soil in the river valleys. In good years, each hectare can yield more than ten *shi* of coarse grain (each *hectare* is ten *mu*, and each *shi* is 450 *jin*). It is known as the granary of northern Manchuria. During the period of Japanese puppet rule, the enemy considered the 3,500 *mu* of reclaimed land in Sifangtai district alone as a treasure.

However, the people of Happy Ridge were in a state of poverty and misery in the past. Happiness did not belong to them, because the fertile land here belonged to others. In addition to the enemy's reclaimed land, most of the land was concentrated in the hands of four or five landlords. Among the 172 households and 2,000 people in the six villages of the ridge, apart from 52 households with one or two *hectares* of land, 114 households with 800 impoverished peasants did not own a single house or a single *mu* of land. In the past, they only received two *cun* of cloth as payment for a day's work for the landlords. In the severe winter, they watched naked as the landlords sold large quantities of surplus grain for cloth, while they themselves did not have enough to eat or wear. Under the heavy pressure of the enemy, puppets, and some reactionary landlords, they lived a terrible life of poverty.

The Democratic Allied Army Brought Happiness
The Democratic Allied Army liberated Happy Ridge, and the Democratic Allied Army brought happiness to the people of Happy Ridge.

Under the leadership of the democratic government, the people of Happy Ridge obtained fertile reclaimed land. The 114 impoverished peasant households were allocated 150 *hectares* of land. The most was given to Zhao De, whose family of twelve, with seven laborers, received 15 *hectares* and four *mu* of land; the least received seven *mu*. From then on, no landless peasants could be found in Happy Ridge. The peasants crowded into the Happy Ridge Farmers' Association used all sorts of happy words to describe their joy when they divided the land. An eighteen-year-old young peasant surnamed Zhu said: "From my grandfather to me, three generations have had no land. Now I have three *hectares* of good land." An old woman named Zhang went around telling people: "We have been allocated six *hectares* of good land and will no longer be poor." Her dizzy old eyes radiated with joy.

Organize to Solve Difficulties
"Although they have been allocated reclaimed land, they can't do anything without livestock to cultivate the land!" (bad elements were saying.)

"See, we will definitely have a way!" the peasants replied forcefully.

In the courtyard of the Farmers' Association, seven large horses and a black mule were tied up. These were distributed to the peasants by the government so that they could sow in time during the spring plowing. The peasants happily looked at these livestock, and some even smiled as they stroked them. No one could describe their current happiness.

But with a total of 150 *hectares* of land, who should these eight livestock be given to plow first? After everyone discussed, they came up with a good idea: "Organize!" They organized in a planned and orderly manner, based on people and land shares, to cultivate collectively. The land ownership still belonged to each individual. Each share contributed ninety *yuan* to buy fodder for the livestock, and the director of the Farmers' Association took on the responsibility of feeding them at his home.

The seeds were sown in time. When the *Mangzhong* season was approaching, they organized to weed again, and the members of the Farmers' Association had even planned for the livestock problem at harvest time. The rich peasant Zhao Ting had a lot of livestock at home but no grass to feed them. Everyone discussed and agreed to let Zhao Ting's livestock eat grass in the public shed, and his livestock would be lent to everyone during the harvest. This made both parties happy.

Organize for Self-Defense
In the river valley west of Happy Ridge, bandits often came out to rob in the past few months. In order to protect their own safety and the land they had been allocated, the peasants of Happy Ridge voluntarily organized for self-defense. An "Armed Self-Defense Department" was established in the Farmers' Association, but the peasants did not like to call them that. They always boasted and said: "Our foreign cannon team! Our foreign cannon team is really good!" This foreign cannon team now has several foreign cannons. Shortly after its establishment, it cooperated with the Eighth Company of the Democratic Allied Army to fight a victory, eliminating seven or eight bandits. Since then, the bandits have not dared to cause trouble again. Now they patrol and stand guard every day. Once, a team member on sentry duty in the river valley caught a cattle thief and sent more than a dozen cattle to the district government.

Their weapons were entirely self-made. The foreign cannons had been hidden underground for more than ten years, and the gunpowder was made by themselves. Four team members scraped alkaline soil in the river valley, refined it into saltpeter, and then mixed it with sulfur to make it.

Solve All Problems by Finding the Farmers' Association
The Happy Ridge Farmers' Association enjoys extremely high prestige in the minds of the peasants. It can solve any problem for the peasants. If an older brother bullied his younger brother, or if Zhang San and Li Si had a quarrel, they would not be convinced without the Farmers' Association adjudicating. Some middle peasants who had not joined the Farmers' Association peered at the entrance of the Farmers' Association and asked to join. Even the rich peasant Zhao the Blind ran to ask the chairman of the Farmers' Association to allow him to join the Farmers' Association.

The days of sorrow and poverty are gone forever, and Happy Ridge is full of happiness.

### 欢喜岭真欢喜

　　欢喜岭真欢喜
    欢喜岭不欢喜
    欢喜岭是黑龙江省绥化县正北的一个镇子。努敏河在它的四面环绕着，四周都是河套里肥沃的黑土，好年景每垧地，可收十余石粗粮（每垧十亩，每石四百五十斤），这里号称北满的粮库。在伪满统治时，仅四方台一个区即三千五百亩开拓地，敌人曾把它当一块宝地。
    但是欢喜岭的人民过去却处在贫苦和悲惨的境况中，欢喜并不属于他们，因为这里肥沃的土地是属于别人的。除敌人的开拓地外，大部土地却集中在四五家地主之手。全岭六个屯子一百七十二户二千名人口中，除了五十二户有一、二垧土地外，一百一十四户八百口人的赤贫农民，房无一间，地无一亩。过去他们给地主做一天活只有两寸布的代价，在严寒的冬天，赤身露体眼看着主家出卖大批的余粮换来布匹，而自己却吃不饱肚子，穿不上衣服。他们在敌伪和某些反动地主的重压下，过着可怕的穷苦日子。
    民主联军带来了欢喜
    民主联军解放了欢喜岭，民主联军把欢喜带给了欢喜岭的人民。
    欢喜岭的人民在民主政府领导下，获得了肥沃的开拓地，一百一十四户赤贫农民分得了一百五十垧土地。顶多的是赵德，他家有十二口人七个劳动力，分了十五垧零四亩地；最少的也分到七亩。从此在欢喜岭再找不到一个无地的农民了。挤在欢喜岭农会的农民们，他们用各种愉快的字眼来形容他们分地时高兴的情形。一个十八岁的姓朱的青年农民说：“从我爷爷到我三辈子没有地，现在我有三垧好地了。”一位张老太太到处向人说：“咱分了六垧好地再不受穷了。”她的晕花的老眼放射着欢喜的光芒。
    组织起来解决困难
    “虽然他们分了开拓地没有牲口种地也办不了事呀！”（坏分子在说着。）
    “看看我们一定有法子！”农民们有力的回答。
    在农会的大院子里，拴着七匹大马一头黑骡子，这是政府为了使农民在春耕时能及时播种，分给他们的。农民们高兴的看着这些牲口，有的还笑眯眯的去抚摸着他们谁也不能形容他们现在的欢喜。
    可是共有一百五十垧地，这八条牲口先给谁耕种？大家讨论的结果，想出了一个好办法就是：“组织起来！”有计划按次序编制起来，按人按地作股，集体耕种，地权仍属各人，每股出九十块钱给牲口买草料，农会主任的家里担任了饲养。
    种籽及时播种了，芒种快到的时候，他们又组织起来锄草，而农会的委员们连秋收时的牲口问题都盘算好了，富农赵亭有很多牲口养在家没有草吃，大家便商量好让赵亭的牲口放到公共的草棚子里去吃草，到秋收时他的牲口要借给大家使用，这样双方都欢喜。
    组织起来自卫
    在欢喜岭的西面河套里，前几个月常有土匪出来抢劫，欢喜岭的农民为了保卫自己的安全和分得的土地，便自动的组织起来自卫。在农民会设立了“武装自卫部”，但是农民们都不喜欢这样叫他们，总是夸耀的说：“俺们的洋炮队呢！俺们的洋炮队可行哩！”这支洋炮队现在已有了数支洋炮，刚成立不久，就配合八连的民主联军打了一次胜仗，消灭了七、八个土匪，从此土匪再不敢出来胡闹了。现在他们每天打更、放哨，有一次一个队员在河套里放哨，捉到了一个偷牛的小偷和十几条牛都送到区政府。
    他们的武器完全是自己解决的，洋炮都是藏在地下十几年的，火药是自己造的。有四个队员在河套里刮碱土，炼出硝来再配上硫磺就制成了。
    一切问题找农会解决
    欢喜岭农会在农民心目中威信极高，它能解决农民的任何问题，哥哥欺侮了弟弟，张三和李四吵了架，不经农会断断是不会服气的。有些没有参加农会的中农，在农会门口张望着要求参加，连富农赵瞎子也跑去请求农会主席准许他参加农会。
    悲苦和穷困的日子一去不复返了，欢喜岭充满了欢喜。
