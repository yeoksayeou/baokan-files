Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 22nd: News from Shanghai: The Shanghai Newspaper Battlefront United Press, Beiping, June 26th dispatch: Four months ago, the United States' reputation in China reached an unprecedented height, which is undeniable. But now, this reputation has plummeted, and Washington must take the most forceful action to stop its continued decline. This can be confirmed by the events of the past week and the opinions of dozens of Chinese people who spoke with reporters. Not only the Chinese Communist Party and liberals, but even ordinary bankers and businessmen, are now gradually feeling that the US policy towards China is both fueling the flames of civil war and prolonging the period of economic instability. The large-scale demonstrations in Shanghai expressing public opinion and the activities of the secret police in Nanjing are the results of this resentment. Three days ago, Mao Zedong broke his year-long silence and publicly accused the United States of increasing military aid to China, making the anti-American sentiment even more serious. In February of this year, Special Envoy Marshall was clearly trying to lead China onto the road of unity and democracy. At that time, it could be said that the US could get whatever it wanted, and both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party would gladly give it. However, now it has changed to gradual distrust. In February, US military aid to China had been stopped, and emphasis was placed on Special Envoy Marshall's political assistance. At present, military and political assistance is roughly evenly divided, but the Kuomintang and the Communist Party receive political assistance, while the National Government alone enjoys military assistance.

Generally, everyone understands that the United States is extremely eager to assist China's political unity, because if China is not united, no country can expect to restore favorable trade with China. However, at the same time, the United States is continuously supplying weapons, ammunition, and supplies, and providing direct military and technical assistance, which is somewhat confusing to both Chinese and foreigners.

Observers cannot help but ask: Although the United States is politically mediating, it is also continuously transporting the tools for continuing the civil war. How can the civil war stop? The answer to these questions is that no one is prepared to admit it, that is, the United States is uneasy about the Soviet influence in China, so it is strengthening the Kuomintang's power, otherwise China may be completely communized.

The United States may hope that all Chinese parties will unite and unite, but it definitely does not want the Communist Party to gain power.

### 中国人民不满华府援蒋内战  美在华声誉一落千丈

　　中国人民不满华府援蒋内战
    美在华声誉一落千丈
    【新华社延安二十二日电】上海来讯：沪报战联合社北平六月二十六日电：四个月以前，美国在中国的声誉达到空前的高度，这是无人置辩的。但到现在，这声誉已经一落千丈，华府方面必须用最有力的行动，才能制止他的继续降落。这是过去一周间的事态，以及和记者交谈的数十位中国人士的意见可以证实的。不单是中国的共产党和自由派，即使是一般银行家和商人，现在也都逐渐感觉到美国对华的政策，既助长内战的火焰，又延长经济不安的时期。上海方面表现民意的大游行，和南京方面秘密警察的活动，都是这种反感所产生的结果。三天前，毛泽东又打破一年来的沉默，公开指责美国增加对华军事援助，使反美情势更趋严重。今年二月间，马歇尔特使显然在谋使中国踏上团结和民主大道，当时可说是美方要什么有什么，国共双方都会欣然给予的；可是，现在已一变而为逐渐的不信任了。在二月间，美国对华军事援助已将停止，而注重在马歇尔特使的政治协助。在目前军政两方面的援助，大致已平分秋色，只是国共双方得到政治协助，军事援助却是国府独享。
    一般人都明白，美国协助中国政治团结是极殷切的，因为中国若不团结，没有一个国家可以期望对中国恢复有利的贸易。可是美国同时因对军器军火和供应品源源接济，并给予直接的军事和技术协助，这一点无论中外人士都有些惘然不解。
    观察家不免要问问：美国虽然在政治上调解，但却又将继续进行内战的工具源源运来，那么内战怎会停止呢？这些问题的答复是没有人准备承认的，它便是美国对于苏方在华的影响惴惴不安，因此正在加强国民党力量，不然中国也许会完全赤化。
    美国或许希望中国各党派联合团结一致，但必定不愿共产党得势。
