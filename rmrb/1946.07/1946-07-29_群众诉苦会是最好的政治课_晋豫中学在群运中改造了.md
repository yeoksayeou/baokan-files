　　"Speaking Bitterness Meetings Are the Best Political Class"
    Jin-Yu Middle School Transformed in the Mass Movement
    Since its opening last November, Jin-Yu Middle School has not grasped the new educational direction sufficiently, resulting in a closed-door approach that is divorced from reality. Not only has the political class been ineffective, but cultural classes have also been affected. Criticism has been coming from outside, and teachers and students inside feel distressed.
    In early May of this year, the teaching and research conference decided: "Go to the mass movement of turning over to learn." However, this decision was opposed by some, who believed that the actual movement had little to do with the school, that the mass movement was the business of the peasant association, and that the school only needed to carry out ideological education and education on the decrees and policies of rent reduction and interest rate reduction. Otherwise, it would affect the implementation of the education plan. Among the students, there were also three different attitudes towards the mass movement: First, a small number of children of landlords were dissatisfied because their families had been struggled against, believing that the mass movement was nonsense. Second, most took a third-party stance, believing that landlords should not oppress peasants, but peasants should not struggle against landlords either. Third, a few honest students basically sympathized with the masses, but believed that studying was important, otherwise it would affect their exam scores. Later, the school's curriculum could not be taught. In "Border Region Construction," when talking about policies such as rent reduction and interest rate reduction, because the teachers spoke irrelevantly, the students listened without interest, and four teachers in a row were replaced without success. At that time, the masses in Jincheng Dongguan were vigorously carrying out the movement to turn over by reducing rent and settling accounts. The leadership felt the seriousness of the problem, so they conducted in-depth mobilization of the school, pointing out that such education had no future and must be combined with the mass movement to make progress, so that learning and application could be consistent. Later, after detailed debates among teachers and in-depth brewing among students, it was finally decided to suspend classes for half a month and fully participate in the Dongguan mass movement to learn.
    Listening to the bloody facts that more than 100 people in Dongguan were brutally killed and forced to death by local bullies and landlords, the students' thoughts and emotions changed. They began to recognize the Chinese feudal forces soaked in thick blood and aroused infinite sympathy for the peasants' struggle for liberation. When a peasant complained of being exploited by usurious loans, resulting in his family being torn apart and his family bankrupted, and his relatives being killed by the landlord Ma Dashao, the person complaining fainted, and the masses raised their fists of revenge. The teachers and students of Jin-Yu Middle School were also burning with anger, excitedly shouting slogans of revenge with the masses. They were involved in the ranks of the peasant movement, and their hearts were closely connected with the hearts of the peasants.
    After returning to school, the students enthusiastically reflected. Some said, "In the past, I thought that the landlord's wealth was inherited from his ancestors, and it was wrong to struggle against the landlord. After listening to the masses speak bitterness and find the roots of poverty, I realized that the landlord made his fortune by exploiting the blood and sweat of laborers, and it is right to struggle against them!" The student whose family had been struggled against said: "In the past, I thought the struggle was excessive and very dissatisfied. Today I realized that what my family did was indeed wrong, and the mass struggle is reasonable." Some poor students said, "In the past, I hoped to become an official after graduating from middle school and be as prestigious and have as much status in the village as the landlord's family. Now I realize that this is a shameful idea. In the future, I must work for the people and follow the path of the masses!" Everyone agreed that the masses' speaking bitterness meeting was the best political class and the masses' movement of turning over was the best school. They all said, "This class is so concrete and profound. Now I really understand what the book says: What is revolution, why revolution, and the greatness of labor creating the world and the power of the masses."
    The students began to establish revolutionary viewpoints and mass viewpoints, and the quality of politics was greatly improved. Cultural classes were also combined with practical applications. For example, studying arithmetic in helping the masses to settle accounts, and absorbing mass life knowledge and vivid language to enrich the content of the Chinese language class, have all achieved considerable results. The students' political vigilance has been greatly improved. They discovered the special agent activities of individual members of the student body who had stirred up dissension and spread rumors in the past, and spontaneously launched a counter-espionage struggle. At the same time, two students who had been deceived and joined the special agent organization also automatically confessed and admitted their mistakes. The unity between teachers and students and among students in Jin-Yu Middle School has been greatly strengthened.
    Participating in the mass movement has transformed Jin-Yu Middle School, and once again proved the truth that "teaching must be combined with practice," and powerfully criticized the dogmatic teaching methods of "reading books to death" and "dead reading" in the past. (Sun Chao)

### “群众诉苦会是最好的政治课”  晋豫中学在群运中改造了

　　“群众诉苦会是最好的政治课”
    晋豫中学在群运中改造了
    晋豫中学从去年十一月开学以来，由于对教育新方针掌握不够，闭门造车脱离实际，不但政治课收效不大，文化课也受到影响，外面纷纷批评，内部师生感到苦闷。
    今年五月初，教导会议决定：“到群众翻身运动中去学习”。但这一决定却引起一部分人的反对，他们认为实际运动和学校关系少，群运是农会的事，学校只需进行思想教育、减租减息的法令政策教育就对了，否则会影响教育计划的实施。在学生中，对群运的看法也有三种不同态度：一、少数地主的子弟，因家庭被斗争不满意，认为群运是胡闹。二、多数是第三者立场，认为地主固然不该压迫农民，但农民也不该斗争地主。三、少数老实学生基本上同情群众，但认为念书要紧，否则影响考试成绩。后来学校的课程讲不下去了，“边区建设”里讲减租减息等政策，由于教员讲的不着边际，学生听着无兴趣，一连换了四个教员都不行；当时晋城东关群众却在轰轰烈烈地进行着减租清算的翻身运动。领导上感到问题的严重，乃对该校进行深入动员，指出这样的教育没有前途，必须与群运结合才能进步，学与用才能一致起来。以后经过教员中详细辩论，学生中深入酝酿，最后决定了全体停课半个月，全力参加到东关群运里去学习。
    倾听着东关一百多人被恶霸地主们活活害死和逼死的血淋淋事实，同学们的思想情绪起了变化。他们开始认识了这个和浓裹血的中国封建势力，对农民翻身斗争激起无限同情。当一个农民诉到被高利贷剥削而妻离子散、倾家荡产、被地主马大少爷害死自己的亲人的时候，诉苦的人晕过去了，群众复仇的拳头举起来了。晋豫中学师生们也怒火高烧，激动地随着群众高呼着复仇口号。他们卷进了农民运动的行列，他们的心和农民的心密切地结合起来了。
    回学校后同学们都热烈地进行反省，有的说：“从前我认为地主的财富是祖上置下的，斗地主不应该。听了群众诉苦找穷根，才知道地主是靠了剥削劳动者的血汗发的家，斗争他们是对的！”家里被斗过的同学说：“过去我认为斗争过火，很不满意，今天才知道家里作的事确乎不对，群众斗争是合理的。”有些穷学生说：“过去我希望中学毕业后做个官，在村里像地主家一样威风，有地位，现在才认识这是可耻的想法，将来我一定要替老百姓办事，走群众的路子！”大家一致认为群众的诉苦会是最好的政治课，群众的翻身运动是最好的学校，都说：“这个课上得又具体，又深刻。现在才真正认识了书上讲的：什么是革命，为什么要革命，以及劳动创造世界和群众力量的伟大。”
    同学们开始树立着革命观点和群众观点，政治质量大为提高；文化课也与实用结合了。如在帮助群众清算中学习算术课，吸收群众生活知识和生动的语言以丰富国语课的内容等，都收到不少成绩。同学们的政治警惕性大为提高，发现了过去同学中个别分子挑拨离间，造谣生事的特务活动，自发地掀起了反特斗争，同时被蒙蔽上当参加了特务组织的两个学员也自动坦白，承认了错误。晋豫中学师生间与同学间的团结都大大的加强了。
    参加群运使晋豫中学得到了改造，又一次的证明了“教学要与实际结合”的真理，有力的批判了过去“读死书”“死读书”的教条主义教学方法。（孙超）
