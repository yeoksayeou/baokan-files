Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th. Representatives of various mass organizations in Yan'an held a current affairs symposium at the Foreign Affairs Office at 9:00 a.m. on the 25th. At the meeting, they expressed extreme indignation at the Nanjing Kuomintang secret agents' beating of representatives of the Shanghai people from all walks of life who were petitioning against the civil war, including Ma Xulun, and expressed deep sympathy and condolences to the representatives who were injured while working for peace. They also passed a telegram, the original text of which is as follows:

Mr. Ma Xulun, Mr. Yan Baohang, and all the representatives petitioning in Nanjing:

We are extremely indignant to hear that you were beaten by secret agents instigated by the Kuomintang authorities. You represent the people's organizations of Shanghai in petitioning in Nanjing, calling for peace and opposing civil war. This is a just act supported by the people of the whole country, but this atrocity arranged by the Kuomintang authorities proves that they are attempting to continue to expand the civil war and persist in dictatorial rule. We believe that the people of the whole country will see through the Kuomintang authorities' conspiracy and will rise up to strongly oppose it. We express our sincere condolences to you and pledge to be your strong support! We send this telegram.

Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Federation of Trade Unions, Youth Federation, Women's Federation, Cultural Association, Yan'an Chamber of Commerce, Overseas Chinese Federation in Yan'an. June 25th.
