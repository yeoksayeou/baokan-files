　　U.S. Holds Congressional Primaries
    Preliminary Statistics Indicate Democrats Have the Advantage
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th] Reports from various sources: Congressional primaries are underway in the United States, with Democratic and Republican candidates holding primaries in various states to nominate their respective party candidates in each state before November. The Republican senatorial primary in Minnesota has recently concluded, with two candidates proposed by the Republican progressive leader Stassen having been elected, namely the state governor Saiyi and Yangdaoer. Saiyi is a Republican who advocates international cooperation and succeeded Stassen as the governor of the state in 1944. According to preliminary statistics, Saiyi received more than 120,000 votes, defeating the well-known Republican isolationist Xipuside by a majority of 74,000 votes. Mr. Xipuside has been repeatedly elected as a senator of Minnesota four times since 1922, reaching 24 years, and is one of the two senators who voted against the United Nations Charter (the other being Senator William Langier of North Dakota). It is generally estimated that the failure of Xipuside symbolizes the fading hope of the isolationists making a comeback in the American Midwest. Yangdaoer defeated Peterson with more than 120,000 votes, while the latter received only more than 50,000 votes.
    It is also reported that in the Democratic congressional primary in Washington State, progressive congressman Delasi, who warmly sympathizes with the Chinese democratic movement, has defeated his opponent, radio commentator Kositigen.
    It is noted that the U.S. Congress will hold elections this year to re-elect all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the senators. The formal election is scheduled for November, and the primaries (i.e., the election of candidates for each party) began on May 6 and are scheduled to be held separately according to the specific circumstances of each state. The term of office for members of the U.S. House of Representatives is two years, and all members are re-elected every two years. Senators serve a six-year term, with one-third being re-elected every two years.

　　美国进行国会预选
    据初步统计民主分子占优势
    【新华社延安十七日电】各方报导：美国会预选正进行中，民主党和共和党的竞选人正在各州分别举行预选，定于十一月之前分别提出各该党在各州之候选人。明尼苏达州之共和党参议员预选顷已结束，由共和党开明领袖史塔生所提出之两位预选人已获当选，一为该州州长赛伊，一为杨道尔。赛伊为主张国际合作之共和党员，于一九四四年继史塔生为该州州长。据初步统计，赛伊得十二万余票，以七万四千票的多数，击败著名的共和党孤立分子希普斯德。希氏自一九二二年以来，四次连任明尼苏达州之参议员，迄今已达二十四年，为投票反对联合国宪章的两名参议员之一（另一为北达科他州参议员威廉·郎吉）。一般估计，希普斯德之失败，象征着孤立派在美国中西部卷土重来之希望日渐暗淡。杨道尔以十二万余票击败彼德逊，后者只得五万余票。
    又悉：在华盛顿州之民主党众议员预选中，热烈同情中国民主运动之进步议员德拉西已战胜其对手无线电评论员科斯底根。
    按美国会将于今年改选全部众议员与三分之一的参议员，正式选举定十一月举行，预选（即各党之候选人选举）已于五月六日开始，按各州具体情形分别订期举行。美国众议员任期两年，每隔两年全部改选一次。参议员任期六年，每两年改选三分之一。
