Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th. Comprehensive reports: Serious British-Jewish conflicts have recently occurred in Palestine, with fierce fighting lasting for several days. On the night of June 28th, large numbers of British troops and Arab police forces suddenly surrounded the Jewish headquarters in Jerusalem, taking swift and unexpected steps to seize some of the weapons of the Jewish secret organization, and arresting several pro-American Jewish upper echelon figures within a few hours. The British side declared via telegram that its actions were only aimed at Jewish terrorist organizations. However, as many as three thousand Jews were arrested at the same time, martial law was universally imposed throughout Palestine, and all border traffic was cut off. On June 30th, British army and armored forces carried out a second phase of officially announced military action in the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem. Aircraft were ordered to circle, and the situation reached its most urgent stage, with the number of casualties increasing rapidly. On July 1st and 2nd, the Jewish Agency repeatedly issued announcements stating: "We are prepared to fight, we will not hand over our weapons. Handing over the weapons of 60,000 Jewish soldiers means the destruction of the entire Jewish people." The announcement authorized its Executive Committee to urge local Jewish committees everywhere to concentrate all their strength to assist the attacked areas, and warned the Palestinian authorities that if they did not immediately cease military action, the Jewish people would absolutely not cooperate with the Palestinian government. On the 2nd, US President Truman issued an emergency statement, calling on the British side to immediately cease military action against the Jewish people and release all Jewish upper echelon figures. On the same day, US Acting Secretary of State Acheson issued a statement denying British Prime Minister Attlee's claim that Britain had notified the United States in advance of its actions in Palestine. He said the United States had no prior knowledge. Acheson also said that the recommendation to allow 100,000 Jews to immigrate to Palestine, based on a US expert group, had returned to the United States from Britain. Based on their report, Truman had issued a formal statement stating: "The US government is prepared to assume the administrative and technical responsibility for transporting 100,000 Jewish immigrants to Palestine."
