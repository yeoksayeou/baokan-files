Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 28th: The people of the Su皖 Border Region, who are resolutely resisting the three-sided encirclement of Chiang Kai-shek's 500,000-strong army, held a memorial meeting for Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, along with an anti-civil war and anti-espionage rally, at Ye Ting Park in Qingjiang City, its central location, on the afternoon of the 26th. Attending were tens of thousands of people from dozens of organizations and groups, including the Central China Branch of the Communist Party of China, the Headquarters and Political Department of the Central China Military Region, the Border Region Government, the Border Region Provisional Assembly, the Central China Federation of Trade Unions, the Farmers' Union, the Women's Federation, the Youth Federation, the Cultural Association, and Construction University. They voiced their indignation at the joint actions of Chiang Kai-shek, who is using his army to attack the Liberated Areas and his secret agents to carry out political assassinations. The assembly passed a telegram to be forwarded by Mr. Zhou Enlai in Nanjing to Mr. Liang Shuming, Mr. Luo Longji, Mr. Shen Junru, Mr. Zhang Bojun, Mr. Zhang Junmai, Mr. Sun Ke, Mr. Shao Lizi, Mr. Wang Shijie, General Marshall, Ambassador Stuart, Mr. Guo Moruo, Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Mr. Hu Zhengzhi in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang Lan, Mr. Shao Congen, Mr. Zhang Qun in Sichuan, Mr. Zhang Dongsun, Mr. Zhang Shenfu, Mr. Li Zhuchen in Pingjin [Beijing and Tianjin], Mr. Miao Jiaming, Mr. Fu Sinian in Kunming, and to all parties, groups, and people across the country. It read: "The Chinese reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of American reactionaries, are launching large-scale military offensives against the Liberated Areas and political assassinations against democratic figures in their controlled areas, which are different tactics for the same crime of undermining peace, betraying democracy, and selling out national interests. The Su皖 Border Region is facing a combined land, sea, and air invasion by Chiang Kai-shek's 500,000-strong army. We are resolutely defending ourselves and have the confidence and strength to smash the reactionaries' offensive. We hope that all peace-loving and democratic people across the country will follow in the footsteps of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen and continue to work together to fight to the end for independence, peace, and democracy. Under the united attack of the people of the whole country, all the conspiracies and crimes of the reactionaries are bound to be disastrously defeated." Finally, the telegram demanded: "(1) Public funeral for the martyrs and preferential treatment for their families; (2) Severe punishment for the murderers and their instigators; (3) Thorough dissolution of the secret service organizations; (4) In order to effectively ensure the safety and freedom of the people from fascist secret service thugs, the fascist elements in the army must be purged, and the police and gendarmerie organs maintaining the security of major cities should be composed of democratic and impartial people in order to avoid the evils of one-party dictatorship and curb the source of chaos; (5) Demand that the United States immediately stop helping Chiang Kai-shek carry out civil war and all acts infringing upon Chinese sovereignty."
