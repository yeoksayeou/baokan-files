Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 4th: During the counter-rebellion self-defense war in the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, more than ten thousand people's militia from Ningwu, Shuoxian, Shanyin, and Shenchi counties, volunteered to support the front lines. On the 16th of last month, when the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army counterattacked the puppet troops in Shuoxian, the militia from dozens of miles away gathered more than a thousand people overnight upon hearing the news to help in the battle, deliver ammunition, and rescue wounded soldiers. The masses enthusiastically delivered water and food to the troops. After the city was liberated, the militia and the masses immediately assisted in investigating bad elements and maintaining order. The masses in the central districts of Ningwu and Shanyin volunteered to use their livestock to transport food and ammunition for the troops and took care of the wounded soldiers with great care. Many people traveled from dozens or even hundreds of miles to the field hospitals to care for their children. Hou Yougong and his brother from Jinnian Village in Shuoxian carried the wounded for more than a hundred miles on the front line. He said, "The Eighth Route Army was gloriously wounded for disarming the puppet troops in Shuoxian, what do we have to fear from contributing a little!" More than thirty students from the Second Middle School and the Second Primary School in Wuzhai volunteered to take care of the wounded in the hospital, and rural women washed bloody clothes for the wounded. People from all walks of life in Shenchi, Wuzhai, and Shuoxian city organized a comfort delegation to go to the front line to comfort the Eighth Route Army.
