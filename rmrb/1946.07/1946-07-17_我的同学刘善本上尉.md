　　When the news that Captain Liu Shanben had flown a "B-24" aircraft from Chengdu, the largest Kuomintang air force base, to Yan'an to quit the civil war, caught my eye, the image of a young man with slender eyes, a full face, and a vigorous spirit—my classmate Liu Shanben—immediately appeared in my mind. His righteous act brought joy to all the Chinese people, glory to us, and gave the reactionaries and warmongers a heavy blow. Although it has been more than ten years since I and Liu Shanben were classmates at Anqiu County Junior High School in Shandong in 1929, everything is still vividly imprinted. At school, I was in the graduating class, and he was in the first year of junior high. Because we lived close, every winter and summer vacation, or longer holidays like Qingming Festival, we would go home together and return to school together. He lived in Xiaoliuzhuang, and I lived in Zhao’s Village, less than half a mile apart.

　　During junior high school, we were all still children, with pure and innocent feelings. Although I was three or four years older than him and two grades higher, I should have been more steady, but I was talkative, loved to make trouble, liked sports, and didn't pay much attention to my studies. Shanben was different from me. His appearance was completely like that of a shy and elegant girl. He rarely spoke and didn't participate much in extracurricular activities. I remember that there was a tennis team in the school at that time, and I was the captain. Perhaps because of this, he would play tennis when he had time. He often advised me to be careful with money, to get along well with classmates, etc. In terms of self-cultivation, it seemed that he was older and in a higher class than me.

　　The following year, I graduated, left school, and left my hometown. We rarely corresponded, and I rarely went home. But I knew that after graduating from junior high school, he went to Beijing to study. When I was studying in Jinan, I heard that he had applied for the air force. The students in the county often regarded this as an honor because they thought that to resist Japan, we must have an air force. Around 1934 or 1935, I ended my school life and devoted myself to journalism. Soon, I fled to Nanjing and Wuhan. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, I traveled everywhere, and gradually became estranged from my old classmates in my hometown. Only occasionally did I know some information about old friends. But the faces of a few classmates who left a deep impression on me often appeared in my memories—especially Liu Shanben.

　　I had only been in the liberated area for two weeks when I encountered bombing by Kuomintang planes in Linyi City. I couldn't understand how educated air force personnel could have the heart to kill their compatriots with American bullets! I had thought that there would definitely be heroes in the air force who would oppose the civil war, but I never expected that the first person to prove my idea was my classmate Liu Shanben. As I write this article, the feeling of glory, comfort, and joy is hard for others to imagine.

　　Liu Shanben's actions will give the warmongers a big headache. The air force personnel trained and educated by the warmongers have responded to the reactionaries' shameless betrayal of the people with righteous actions. The Kuomintang reactionaries and the backstage boss of the warmongers, the American reactionaries, should also learn the lessons they deserve from Shanben's actions.

　　All the kind Chinese people will inevitably increase their confidence because of Shanben's actions. The peace that our people desire will never be destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. If the warmongers insist on going their own way, then there will be thousands upon thousands of anti-war heroes from the common people around them and under their feet, following Shanben and bravely standing up.

　　I am confident that after Shanben, there will be more air force personnel, army personnel, and navy personnel who will successively lay down their weapons. Because the weapons they use today are all tools of the conspiracy of American arms dealers and reactionaries to slaughter the Chinese people and attempt to rule China. If a bullet or a drop of gasoline takes effect, it will make the Chinese people heartbroken and tearful. And what is exchanged for mutual残害 is the satisfied grin of foreign conspirators! Excellent Chinese sons and daughters will never and should not be so foolish. Those who have been to the Great Rear Area, especially air force friends, will not forget that before the Pacific War, the Japanese bombed Chongqing and other major cities in the rear, slaughtering the Chinese people. The enemy planes of my air force comrades were created by the steel and gasoline supplied by the United States.

　　Recently, Shanben stood in front of the microphone of the Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station and issued a solemn call. People will firmly remember his roar: The people of the whole country demand peace. We will oppose whoever destroys peace!

　　我的同学刘善本上尉
    赵则观
    刘善本上尉为退出内战驾“Ｂ二四式”机自国民党最大空军根据地——成都飞到延安的消息，触入我的眼帘的时候，我的脑子里立刻浮现出一个细长眼睛，丰满脸型、精神健旺的青年——我的同学刘善本的影子。他的义举给全中国人民以喜悦，给我们以光荣，并给反动派和好战分子以重重的一击。一九二九年我和刘善本在山东安邱县立初中同学时间，虽已远隔了十多年，但一切印象还很清晰。在学校时，我是毕业班，他在初一，因为家住得近，每逢寒暑假，或较长的假期如清明节时，都是一同回家，又一同从家里上学校。他住在小刘庄，我住在赵家庄，这两个村子，相隔不到半里地。
    在初中时期，大家还都是孩子，感情纯朴天真，虽然我比他大三四岁，又比他高上两年级，照理我应当比他稳重，但我自小就好说话，爱闹乱子，喜欢运动，对功课不大用心。善本却和我不同，他的外表完全像位羞涩幽雅的少女，很少讲话，不大参加课外活动。记得当时学校里有网球队，我是队长，或者为了这个缘故，他有空也打打网球，他常劝我注意用钱，和同学相处要和气等等，按照修养来说，好像他比我岁数大班次高似的。
    第二年，我毕业离开了学校，也离开了家乡，我们之间很少通信，我也很少回家。但知道他在初中毕业以后，到北平读书。当我在济南读书时，听说他投考空军了，县中的同学们常以此引为光荣，因为想到要抗日就必须有空军。大约在一九三四年到三五年之间，我结束了学校生活，投身于新闻事业。不久流亡到南京、武汉，抗战八年更是到处奔波，跟故乡老同学们，便渐渐隔膜了。只在一些偶然的机会中，知道一些故人的情况。但对我有深刻印象的少数同学的面影，则常常出现于回忆中——特别是刘善本。
    我踏入解放区才两个星期，就在临沂城里遇到国民党飞机的轰炸，我不明白有教养的空军人员，会忍心以美国子弹杀射自己的同胞！我曾想到空军中一定会出现反内战的壮士，却没想到第一个证明我这种想法的，却正是自己的同学刘善本。当我执笔写这篇文章时，光荣、安慰、愉快的心情，是他人所难想象的。
    刘善本的行动，将使好战分子大伤脑筋，好战分子一手训练教养的空军人员，以正义的行动来答复反动派叛卖人民的无耻行为。国民党反动派与好战分子的后台老板美国反动派，也该从善本的行动得到应有的教训。
    全中国善良的老百姓都必然会因善本的行动而增加更多的信心，我们全国老百姓所希望的和平，绝不是国民党反动派所能破坏的。如果好战分子一意孤行，则他们的身边脚下，会有千千万万的出身老百姓的反战壮士，跟着善本之后，英勇的站出来。
    我自信继善本之后，必然有更多的空军人员、陆军人员、海军人员、相继放下他的武器。因为他们今天所用的武器，都是美国军火商人反动派残杀中国老百姓，企图统治中国的阴谋行为的工具。如果有一颗子弹、一滴汽油发生了效力，便会使中国老百姓伤心流泪。而自相残害换来的，却是外国阴谋家快意的狞笑！优秀的中华儿女们，决不会也不应该这样愚蠢，到过大后方的人，尤其是空军朋友，都不会忘记在太平洋战争以前，日本人轰炸重庆及后方各大城市，残杀中国老百姓吧，我空军战友的敌机，正是美国的钢铁汽油所供给去造成的。
    最近善本站在延安新华广播电台的播音器前，发出了庄严的号召，人们将牢牢地铭记着他的吼声：全国人民要求和平，谁破坏和平，我们就反对谁！
