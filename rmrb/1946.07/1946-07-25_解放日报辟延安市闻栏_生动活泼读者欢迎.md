Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: Recently, the "Yan'an City News Collection" column, specially opened in the Border Region edition of the Liberation Daily, has been quite popular with readers. Its characteristic is to reflect urban life from a fragment or a side, showing the big from the small. Its writing style is not restricted by general news, and its scope of reporting touches on all aspects of life. It has been published three times now. A few selections are excerpted below:

Air Force Personnel During an Air Raid

On the 17th, Captain Liu Shanben and ten Air Force friends visited the nursery. As soon as they arrived at the nursery, they were surrounded by the children. Some climbed on Captain Liu, some sat on their laps, and innocently asked, "Uncle Liu! How many babies can sit on one airplane?" "Uncle Liu, is the plane faster than the crow?" "Uncle Liu, we want to ride in an airplane," making everyone laugh. The children then performed singing, Yangko dancing, and circle dances... Everyone was engrossed in watching when suddenly an air raid alarm sounded, and Chiang's planes appeared in the sky. The children quickly hid in the cave dwellings. One Air Force friend couldn't help but exclaim, "Why must children be subjected to such fright even after peace?"

Plunging into Raging Torrent to Save People and Vehicles

Around 12:00 noon on the 15th, heavy rains caused the Yan River to swell. A ferry at the foot of Qingliang Mountain, due to a momentary slip by the boatman, drifted about half a li into the river's center and couldn't reach the shore. More than ten people on board were helpless. Fortunately, police officers Zhang Dengnai, Yue Youfang, Liu Guanghou, and Jiao Jianhua from the Second Precinct of the Public Security Bureau bravely swam to the rescue, finally averting the crisis. On the 18th, around 6:00 PM, three coal-laden carts with nine animals from the Security Office were suddenly swept away by the raging water while crossing the Yan River. Both people and vehicles were carried downstream, and lives of people and animals were in great danger. At this time, three workers from the newspaper, one transportation worker from the horse stable, and staff members from Yan'an University, along with villagers from Dongguan, bravely jumped into the river to rescue them. After half an hour of intense work, the animals and people were saved.

Air Defense Guard Team

Recently, Chiang's planes have been constantly intruding into the airspace over Yan'an City. Citizens have spontaneously organized an air defense guard team. Company and platoon leaders from the self-defense army, as well as engraver Xia Jiafu and over twenty others, volunteered to join as team members. Xia Jiafu said, "To protect the interests of the masses, I am not afraid of death. I am willing to guard the streets during air raids." During several alarms, the team members stood armed at their posts, maintaining air defense order and serving as a powerful assistant to the police.

Citizens and Culture

The Yan'an Civic Education Center is being built opposite the Border Region Government. The new site, a five-room building, is expected to be completed by the end of the month, costing approximately 27 to 28 million Border Region currency. Currently, the old building is small, and it is very crowded with people who go there daily to read books and newspapers. It is said that the citizens' favorite reading materials are the Shanghai-published *Xiaoxi* (News), *Wenhui* and the Chongqing *Xinhua Daily*, but unfortunately, these publications cannot be delivered regularly due to the Kuomintang's blockade.

　　解放日报辟延安市闻栏
    生动活泼读者欢迎
    【新华社延安二十二日电】最近解放日报边区版特辟“延安市闻集”一栏，颇受读者欢迎。其特点是从一个片断一个侧面去反映城市生活，小中见大。其写法不受一般新闻的限制，其采记范围接触到生活的各个方面。现已出三次，兹选录数则如后：
    空军人士在空袭中
    十七日，刘善本上尉和十位空军朋友参观保育院，一到院里就被孩子们包围住了。有的往刘上尉身上爬，有的坐在他们的腿上，天真的发问：“刘叔！一架飞机能坐多少娃娃？”“刘叔叔飞机快乌鸦快？”，“刘叔叔我们要坐飞机”，逗的大家只是笑。小朋友又表演唱歌、扭秧歌、拉圆圈………大家正看得出神，忽然空袭警报蒋机出现在天空，小朋友们都迅速的躲到窑里去了。有位空军朋友不禁感慨的说：“为什么和平以后，还要让孩子们受这样的惊恐呢？”
    跃身激流救人车
    十五日上午十二时左右，下川大雨延河暴涨，清凉山下一渡船，因船夫一时失手，漂流河心约半里许，不能靠岸，舟中十余人束手无策，幸有公安局二分所警士张登乃、岳有芳、刘光厚、焦建华等，奋不顾身泅水抢救，卒至挽回危局。又十八日午后六时许，有保安处驮炭大车三辆牲口九匹，正渡延河之际，突被猛水冲走，连人带车顺流而下，人畜生命甚是危急。此时有报社工友三人，马号运输员一人及延大工作人员和东关老乡各一人，即奋勇舍身跳河营救，经半小时紧张打捞，始将牲口人员救起。
    防空警卫队
    近来蒋机不断侵扰延市上空，市民自动组织防空警卫队，自卫军连、排长及刻字工人夏家富等二十余人，自告奋勇参加为队员。夏家富说：“为保护大众的利益，我不怕死，我愿意空袭时在街上守卫。”几次警报，队员都荷枪站到自己岗位上，防空秩序井然，为警察之有力助手。
    市民与文化
    延市民教馆，正在边府对面修建，一座五间大小的新址，月底可竣工，约需边币两千七八百万元。目前旧馆狭小，每日前往阅读书报者，甚为拥挤，据云市民最喜欢读的是上海出版之《消息》、《文汇》及重庆之《新华日报》等，可惜这些刊物，因被国民党封锁，不能经常运到。
