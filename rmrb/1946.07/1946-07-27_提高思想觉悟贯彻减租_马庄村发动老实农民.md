　　Raise Ideological Awareness and Implement Rent Reduction
    Mazhuang Village Mobilizes Honest Farmers
    [Our Taihang News] After the anti-traitor movement this spring, farmers in Mazhuang Village, Huixian County, have been considerably mobilized. However, out of the 71 households in the village, only 32 have joined the Farmers' Association, and 19 honest poor and middle peasants have not participated. The reason is that the mobilization of the masses was not thorough enough, and rent reduction was not complete. These farmers are not yet ideologically conscious, are afraid of meetings, and have not gained much from the struggle. They do not actively participate in the movement. Members of the Farmers' Association are also unwilling for these honest farmers to join, mainly due to the following concerns: 1. They believe these people are ideologically backward. 2. They fear that their participation in the Farmers' Association will leak information. 3. They don't speak at meetings but still have to be given a share of the fruits of the struggle. 4. In the past, some individuals stole from others, and their participation in the Farmers' Association would damage its reputation. 5. Some individuals are from other villages. The leadership studied these ideological situations and proposed the slogan of thoroughly reducing rent and mobilizing honest farmers. First, they worked on the thinking of the activists in the Farmers' Association, raising three questions for everyone to reflect on: Who does the Communist Party serve? How did we join the Farmers' Association and achieve liberation? Is it right for us to forget the poor after we have been liberated? After discussion, the thinking of the Party members changed first. Someone reflected, "We only complain that others are backward, but our initial ideas were not as good as theirs!" Then they said that they must pull them all up to achieve liberation together. Furthermore, they realized that without the participation of these honest farmers, the foundation of the Farmers' Association would not be strong enough, so everyone's thinking became clearer. Immediately, a general meeting of the Farmers' Association was convened to mobilize and discuss who the Farmers' Association serves? Is it better to have many people or few people? Everyone believed that it served the poor and that it was better to have many people. After this education, the members' thinking changed, and they deliberated on who could join the Farmers' Association and who could not, and how to continue to expand the Farmers' Association and deepen the liberation movement.

　　提高思想觉悟贯彻减租
    马庄村发动老实农民
    【本报太行讯】辉县马庄村，经过打通思想发动老实“落后”农民，积极起来参加农会，进行翻身运动。辉县八区马庄村，经过今春的反奸运动后，农民已有相当发动。但在全村七十一户中，参加农会者仅三十二户，还有十九户老实贫农中农没有参加。原因是发动群众时不够深入，减租不彻底，这些农民在思想上还不自觉，怕开会，他们得到的斗争果实也不多，对运动不积极参加。农会会员也不愿意老实农民参加农会，思想上主要有这几种顾虑：一、认为这些人思想落后。二、怕他们参加农会走露消息。三、他们开会不发言还得给他们分斗争果实。四、个别人过去偷过人参加农会坏了农会名誉。五、个别人是外庄人，领导上研究了这些思想情况，提出彻底减租，发动老实农民的口号。首先打通农会中积极分子思想，提出三个问题，让大家反省共产党是给谁办事的？咱怎样进了农会和翻身？咱翻了身忘了穷人对不对？经过讨论，党员思想首先起了变化。有人反省说：“光嫌人家落后，咱起先的想法还不如人家哩！”接着他们说非拉起他们都来翻身不行。又进一步研究出农会没有这些老实农民参加，根基不算顶牢靠，于是大家思想上更明确起来。当即召开农会全体大会，进行动员，讨论农会到底给谁办事？人多好？人少好？大家都认为是为穷人办事，人多好。经过这些教育，会员思想上都有了变化，他们在酝酿谁能进农会谁不能进，如何继续扩大农会，深入翻身运动。
