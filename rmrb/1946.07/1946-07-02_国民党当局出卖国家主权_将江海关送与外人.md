　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Shanghai News: The Kuomintang authorities have recently handed over the entire Jianghai Customs to foreign control. Since the Customs was "taken over" by the authorities, the position of Inspector General has been held by an American, Li Du. The Chinese national, Ding Guitang, only served as Deputy Inspector General. However, after only seven months in the deputy position, the authorities removed Ding from his post and replaced him with a Briton named Richards. Furthermore, the former Tianjin Customs Inspector, Mei Weiliang, and other foreign customs officers have come to China one after another. This act of selling out sovereignty by the Kuomintang authorities has aroused anger and protest from customs employees, customs brokers, the shipping industry, and patriotic people from all walks of life in this area.
