　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 13th: Chairman Li Yunchang of the Rehe Provincial Government recently spoke to this agency's reporter, sternly condemning Chiang Kai-shek's unreasonable demand that "the CCP must withdraw from Rehe and other places." Chairman Li pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek had already betrayed Rehe with his policy of non-resistance fourteen years ago, and during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he retreated all the way from the Great Wall to Mount Emei. The Communist Party, since the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, had persisted in arduous anti-Japanese struggles in Northeast China and Rehe. After countless setbacks and major sacrifices, they established vast liberated areas from western Liaoning in the east, to Fengning in the west, north to Chifeng, and south to eastern Hebei, strengthening the confidence of more than 6.7 million people in the victory against Japan. After the Japanese surrendered, under the leadership of the Rehe democratic government, the people moved towards prosperity and happiness. Unfortunately, in January of this year, Chiang's troops even seized Pingquan to Yixian. For the past six months, they have been ravaging the people of that county without stopping for a moment. Chairman Li stated: The people of Rehe have every right to demand that Chiang's troops withdraw from Rehe, because they sold out Rehe and tore up the truce agreement.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: Kuomintang authorities are actively enlisting soldiers in Shenyang. According to a report in the Tianjin Yishi Daily on the 5th, Shenyang City will conscript 5,000 recruits as replacements. From the 23rd of last month to the 3rd of this month, more than 1,000 people have been forced to join the army. All young men aged 22 and 23 must go to designated locations for examination, and printing workers are also subject to conscription. Each newspaper office can only have fifteen technical workers granted a postponement of conscription.

　　热河省李主席谈话
    严斥蒋介石无理要求
    沈阳国民党当局积极征兵
    【新华社承德十三日电】热河省政府主席李运昌，顷对本社记者发表谈话，严斥蒋介石所提出之“中共须撤出热河等地”的无理要求，李主席指出蒋介石早在十四年前，以不抵抗主义断送热河，抗战期间又从长城一直退到峨嵋山；共产党从一九三一年“九一八”，即在东北热河坚持艰苦的抗日斗争，经过无数挫折与重大牺牲，东起辽西，西至丰宁，北逾赤峰，南迄冀东，建立起辽阔的解放区，坚定了六百七十余万人民对抗日胜利的信心。日寇投降后，在热河民主政府领导下，人民走向繁荣幸福。不幸今年一月间，蒋军竟将平泉至义县也给抢占。半年以来，在该县蹂躏人民未尝稍停。李主席称：热河人民有充分权利要求蒋军退出热河，因为他们出卖了热河，并撕毁了停战协定。
    【新华社延安十二日电】国民党当局在沈阳积极征兵。据五日天津益世报报导，沈市将征集补充兵员五千人，自上月二十三日至本月三日，已有一千余人被迫入伍。所有年在二十二、二十三岁青年男子，均须到指定地点候验，印刷工人亦须抽征。每家报馆只有十五名技术工人可以缓征。
