Wenhui Daily reporter's dispatch from the Shandong Liberated Area: Our reporter arrived yesterday in Lin Yi, the capital of the Shandong Liberated Area. The heat was greatly reduced by a night of rain. Today, in a quiet garden, we had breakfast with General Chen Yi and talked freely for over an hour. We talked about everything under the sun. Our shared impression of General Chen Yi is that he is extremely frank. Bureaucratic airs have disappeared in the Liberated Area, and General Chen Yi is the same as all other Liberated Area workers in this respect. General Chen Yi is currently commanding the military throughout the province. He does not deny the seriousness of the situation, but repeatedly said in a humorous tone: "If the people of the whole country all demand peace, whoever wants to fight will not be able to bear it." He also said: "I have also discussed this point with Kuomintang generals Wang Yaowu and Gu Zhutong: If superior equipment could solve the problem, then the people's army would not be what it is today, and China's resistance against Japan in the past would not have been possible." General Chen Yi's Sichuan accent is extremely strong. Listening to it today, I feel that his native accent has not changed.

Based on the impressions I have gained in the week since entering the Liberated Area, I am even more convinced that if civil war unfortunately breaks out, the one who strikes first will ultimately suffer a decisive disadvantage. All the people in the Liberated Areas have been armed, and their determination and enthusiasm to support the democratic government are increasing day by day. In some areas, the emotions have reached a fever pitch, because the initial democratic measures have brought about a universal and obvious improvement in their lives. Moreover, the thorough preferential treatment of military families makes them have no worries about participating in the war to defend democracy.

In addition, based on what I have seen during my travels, beggars and bandits have disappeared. Some "refugees" who were deceived by propaganda and left their homes are now returning one after another to rebuild their fields and live peacefully with their fellow villagers who never left. A large number of intellectuals, disregarding the strict blockade, are coming here one after another to study and work. Although the food eaten here is only coarse, there is no need to worry about "hunger." These words are only for recollection. Friends who have not entered the Liberated Area may find it difficult to imagine such miracles.

After emphasizing the preciousness of peace, Commander Chen did not shy away from the imminent danger of war. He believes that if the Kuomintang army attacks according to its superior equipment, it may have superficial "victories" at first, but the people will defend every inch of land with all their strength, and in the end, and it won't be long before the attackers will inevitably be defeated. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese mobilized extremely large forces to carry out large-scale "mopping-up" operations with "iron wall encirclements," but they still did not hinder the survival and growth of the people's army.

### 文汇报记者通讯：山东解放区观感

　　文汇报记者通讯：山东解放区观感
    文汇报记者自山东解放区发出通讯称：记者一行昨到山东解放区省会临沂，一夜降雨，酷热大减，今于一静静的花园中与陈毅将军共进早餐，并畅谈一小时许。海阔天空，无所不谈，我人对陈将军共同之印象为极其坦白。官僚架子在解放区已绝迹，陈将军此点固与所有解放区工作人员相同。陈将军刻指挥全省军事，渠不否认局势之严重，但屡以幽默之口吻谓：“如果全国人全都要求和平，谁想打仗谁就吃不消”。渠并谓：“这点意思也与国民党将领王耀武、顾祝同谈过：如果优良装备可以解决问题，那么人民的军队将没有今天，而过去中国的抗日也不会成为可能”。陈将军之四川口音极为浓重，记者今日听来，颇有乡音未改之感。
    以记者踏入解放区一周所得之观感，亦更相信内战倘不幸爆发，先动手者终将蒙决定之不利。所有解放区之老百姓均已武装起来，渠等对民主政权拥护之决心与热情，与日俱增，若干地区之情绪已白热化，盖初步之民主设施已使彼等之生活有普遍而显然之改善也。而军人家属之优待彻底，更使彼等参加保卫民主战争时无后顾之忧。
    此外，就记者经历之行程所见，乞丐盗匪已绝迹，若干被欺骗宣传背井离乡之，“难民”，刻都相继归来，重整田园，与未曾离去之乡亲里人和平共处。大批知识分子不顾严密之封锁，络绎到此间读书和工作。此间人士食用，虽仅粗粝，但已无虑“饥饿”。此等字样，仅可供回忆而已。未进入解放区之朋友，对此等奇迹，恐亦难于想像。
    陈军长于强调和平之可贵后，亦不讳饰战机之危迫，渠相信国民党之军队如按其优势配备进攻，最初或有表面之“胜利”，但人民必将以全力寸土必守，最后且为期不长，进攻者必将溃败无疑。抗战时期，日人曾动员极入兵力进行“铁壁合围”之大“扫荡”，但仍无碍于人民的军队之生存及成长。
