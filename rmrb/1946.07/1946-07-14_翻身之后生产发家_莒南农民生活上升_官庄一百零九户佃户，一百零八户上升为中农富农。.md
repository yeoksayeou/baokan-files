　　After Emancipation, Production Leads to Prosperity: Life of Farmers in Junan Improves
　　In Guanzhuang, 108 out of 109 Tenant Households Rise to Middle or Rich Peasant Status

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 10th] After two and a half years of great production efforts, the economic lives of the people in Junan County (southern part of Ju County) in the Binhai District have generally improved. Taking district villages as examples: In Shiguanzhuang, Daidian District, all 45 households were originally tenant farmers. As a result of hard work in production, the total cultivated land area of the village increased from 240 mu to over 1,000 mu. Among them, 8 households rose to become rich peasants, and the other 37 households all rose to middle peasant status. In Guanzhuang, Landun, all 109 households were also tenant farming households in the past; in the past two and a half years, 108 households have risen to become rich and middle peasants, and the remaining household has also become a poor peasant. In Longtouzhuang, Qianquan District, out of a total of 123 households in the village, the original 42 poor peasant households have now been reduced to 5. In Xiaobin District, out of a total of 5,320 households in the entire district, 50 middle and poor peasant households have risen to become rich peasants; 3,120 tenant farmers and hired laborers have risen to become middle peasants. Examples of individual production leading to prosperity: Fan Yufa of Fanjiazhuang was originally extremely poor and landless. He actively reclaimed wasteland and improved farming methods in production. Last year, his 1.3 mu of cotton fields yielded 160 jin of clean cotton, exceeding the average yield by two times. He has now risen to become a rich peasant with 26 mu of land. Liu Xugao, a hired laborer from Longtouzhuang, used the sorghum he earned after ceasing work in 1933 as capital to make and sell pancakes to earn profits and buy land, and now he has become a prosperous middle peasant with 20 mu of land. Niu Xuepan from Hujing Guanzhuang was once a beggar. Due to his personal hard work in production, and his wife spinning yarn day and night, he has now risen to become a middle peasant with 18 mu of land. Another example is Li Wenyuan, a hired laborer from Liangjiadianzi, who once fell into difficulty and begged for food. After two years of hard work in reclaiming wasteland and production, he now has 9 mu of land, and the grain he harvested last year is enough for the whole family to eat this year with some surplus.

　　翻身之后生产发家
　  莒南农民生活上升
　　官庄一百零九户佃户，一百零八户上升为中农富农。
    【新华社临沂十日电】滨海区莒南县（莒县之南部）人民经两年半的大生产后，经济生活普遍上升、以区村单位为例：大店区史官庄全庄四十五户原均佃户，努力生产结果，全庄耕地面积由二百四十亩增至千余亩，其中八户上升为富农，另三十七户全部升为中农。兰墩官庄全庄共一百零九户，过去也是佃户庄；两年半中，一百零八户上升为富农及中农，余一户亦升为贫农。前泉区龙头庄全庄一百二十三户中，原有四十二户贫农现已减至五户。筱宾区全区五千三百二十户中，有五十户中农贫农，升为富农；有三千一百二十户佃户雇工，上升为中农。个人生产发家为例：范家庄之范玉法原赤贫无地，在生产中积极开荒并改良农作法，去年一亩三分棉田，收净花一百六十斤，超过一般产量二倍，现已升为有地二十六亩之富农。龙头庄雇工刘煦高，于二十二年歇工后，将增资所得的高粱作本，打饼做买卖以赢利购地，现已成为拥有二十亩地的富裕中农。胡京官庄钮学潘曾为乞丐，由于个人努力生产，其妻则日夜纺纱，现已升为拥地十八亩的中农。又如良家店子雇工李文元，曾一度落难讨饭，经两年努力开荒生产，现已有地九亩，去年收的粮食，够今年一年食用尚有余裕。
