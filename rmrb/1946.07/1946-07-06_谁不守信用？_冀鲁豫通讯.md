　　Who is Breaking Their Promise?
　　Ji Lu Yu Correspondence
　　　　We all must keep our promises, don't learn from the Kuomintang.
　　On June 2nd, Mr. Tarde, consultant to the Yellow River Commission, convened a meeting of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission in Heze. At this meeting, it was decided that the burlap sacks would be transported to each repair section on June 4th, and work should begin as soon as possible in the Liberated Areas (work had already started at that time). Mr. Tarde said, "We must keep our promises, don't learn from the Kuomintang." The Communist Party has always been trustworthy. Mr. Tarde may have been deceived by the Kuomintang too many times, or perhaps he doesn't understand the Communist Party and the people in the Liberated Areas well enough, to say that we must keep our promises. We firmly replied that as long as the Kuomintang can keep their promises and earnestly implement the Nanjing Agreement, we are confident that the dike repairs in the Liberated Areas can be completed.
　　　　District Chief Lei is Anxious
　　On June 4th, Mr. Wang Huayun, Director of the Border Region Yellow River Commission, announced this decision that night. Zhang, the County Chief of Shou Zhang, who was attending the meeting in Heze, immediately issued instructions to the districts and villages in his county, ordering the construction of warehouses and roads for trucks in the Fifth District, and also mobilizing militia to guard the warehouses. After receiving the instructions, District Chief Lei of the Fifth District stayed up all night, mobilized more than two hundred people, and quickly repaired the roads and warehouses. He also mobilized one hundred and twenty-nine militiamen, built sheds in Dongluo Village, and bought chicken, eggs, tea, and tobacco and alcohol - in short, the best things that the people in the Liberated Area could find, to prepare to entertain the foreign friends who came to the Liberated Area to provide relief. District Chief Lei had just recovered from his illness, and his face was still sallow. He didn't rest for a day and a night, and was very busy.
　　　　Disappointed
　　On June 5th, they waited from dawn until noon, their eyes dry with anticipation, but the trucks did not come. At first, everyone thought that Heze was far away from here, but as it got dark, they still did not come. How could people not be anxious? All the people waiting constantly asked District Chief Lei: "Why haven't the trucks come? Why haven't the burlap sacks come?" District Chief Lei really had no words to answer them. It was already dark, but the trucks still did not come. The more than two hundred households that were mobilized, the farmers who were harvesting wheat, and even more people were disappointed.
　　　　Who is breaking their promise?
　　Now it is already the 11th, but the trucks and burlap sacks still haven't arrived. The people of Shou Zhang, who were liberated from the depths of misery by the Eighth Route Army, were already destitute. Now they are faced with this unprecedented dike repair project and desperately need relief. The grain and materials promised in the Nanjing Agreement for dike repairs in the Liberated Areas are deeply etched in the minds of the people in the Fifth District. Every time they see District Chief Lei, they ask: "Have the burlap sacks arrived? Why haven't the trucks come?" District Chief Lei raised this question to County Chief Zhang: "How do we explain this to the people?" They were both in great difficulty. Who is breaking their promise? The facts clearly show that the Kuomintang is procrastinating and evading the supply of materials and has no sincerity in the Nanjing Agreement. It is hoped that Mr. Tarde will urge the Kuomintang to earnestly implement the Nanjing Agreement and quickly transport the grain and materials, so as to prevent the dike repair work from being forced to stop due to lack of grain and materials.

　　谁不守信用？
    冀鲁豫通讯
            咱们都要守信用，别和国民党学着
    六月二日，黄委会顾问塔德先生，在荷泽召开了黄河水利委员会会议，在这个会议上决定要在六月四日将洋面运到各修防段，但是在解放区要及早开工（当时已经开始工作），塔德先生说：“咱们要守信用，别和国民党学着”。共产党向来是没有不守信用的地方，塔德先生或许是受国民党的欺骗太多了，也或许对共产党和解放区的老百姓了解得不够，而说出要我们守信用的话，我们坚定的回答，只要国民党方面能守信用，认真执行南京协议，在解放区的修堤，是有把握完成的。
            急坏了雷区长
    六月四日，洋面要送到各地，边区黄委会主任王化云氏当夜宣布了这个决定，在荷泽开会的寿张张县长，立即给本县区村下指令，叫在五区赶修仓库和汽车路，另外还要动员民兵来看守仓库，五区雷区长接到指示后，一夜没睡觉，动员了二百多人，很快把路和仓库修好了，还动员一百二十九个民兵，在东雒村搭起了棚，买好了鸡、鸡蛋、茶叶、烟、酒，总之解放区老百姓认为最好的东西都买来了，准备好好招待来解放区救济的外国朋友们。雷区长病刚好，脸上还黄巴巴的，他一天一夜没有休息，可把他忙坏了。
            失望了
    六月五日，他们从黎明一直等到中午，眼睛都盼干了，但是汽车没有来。起初大家认为荷泽离这边很远，但到天黑仍然没有来，人们能不焦急吗？所有等待的人们不断的向雷区长发问：“汽车怎么还不来？洋面怎么还不来”雷区长真没话答复他们。天已经黑了，但汽车终于没有来，被动员来的二百多户，正在收麦的老百姓和更多的人们都失望了。
            谁不讲信用呢？
    现在已经是十一号了，汽车、洋面还是没有来。从水深火热中被八路军解放的寿张老百姓，本来已是山穷水尽了，现在又碰到这个修堤的空前大工程，当然急需救济，南京协议中，允许给解放区修堤的粮款器材，都深深的印在五区老百姓的脑子里，他们每见了雷区长就问：“洋面来了没有？汽车怎么还不来呢？”雷区长向张县长提出这个问题：“如何向老百姓解释？”他们都作了大难。这是谁不讲信用呢？事情已具体的说明，是国民党方面对物资供给推拖敷衍，对南京协议没有什么诚意，希望塔德先生敦促国民党，切实执行南京协议，快把粮款物资运来，以免修堤工作因无粮款器材而被迫停工。
