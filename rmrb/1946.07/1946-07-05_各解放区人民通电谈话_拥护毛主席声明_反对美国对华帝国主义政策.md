Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: Chairman Mao's statement on the 22nd of last month, opposing the American military aid to Chiang Kai-shek's bill, continues to receive support and endorsement from the broad masses of people in various liberated areas. They have sent telegrams one after another, demanding that the American authorities cancel this bill, withdraw American troops stationed in China, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. The Joint Construction Association of all circles in Rehe Province, as well as various organizations of workers, peasants, women, youth, and culture, representing six million people of the province, jointly sent a telegram, demanding that the American army, navy, and air force immediately withdraw from Chinese territory and cease and recall all assistance to Chiang Kai-shek. It stated: We will not forget that the Chiang troops who illegally invaded eastern Rehe were transported by American warships. The suffering we endure today is actually caused jointly by the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialist elements. Various groups in Central Hebei, representing ten million people in Central Hebei, issued an open letter to compatriots across the country, painfully recounting the American disasters suffered by the people of Central Hebei. Since the American troops landed in Tanggu last November, they have used American weapons to arm the Kuomintang army, helped the Kuomintang transport troops and ammunition, and even attacked the liberated areas. In the Yongding River North Self-Defense War, more than 200 militiamen were injured by American bullets, and many peaceful residents also innocently sacrificed themselves under American-made shells. The people of Central Hebei deeply hate this sinful policy of American imperialist elements. The Shanxi-Suiyuan Liberated Area Senate, representing four million compatriots in Shanxi-Suiyuan, telegraphed the whole country, believing that Chairman Mao completely represents the voice of the people across the country and hoping that peace-loving and democratic people will urgently save the current serious situation.

More than 15,000 merchants in Zhangjiakou City sent a telegram to the business community across the country, calling for joint opposition to the American imperialist elements' policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war.

This newspaper, Yangcheng, 2nd: Chairman Mao's statement opposing American aid to Chiang in the civil war has been enthusiastically supported by people from all walks of life here. The Taiyue Administrative Office and the Taiyue Senate said in their telegram: Chairman Mao's statement completely represents our opinion. Our border region of three million people will fully support the demands put forward in Chairman Mao's statement: resolutely oppose the American military aid to China bill, oppose American armed intervention in China's internal affairs, and resolutely demand the withdrawal of American troops from China. Wei Heng, chairman of the Taiyue District Federation of Trade Unions, Peasants' Associations, Youth Associations, and Women's Associations, representing one million organized masses, said: We call on the people of the entire region to resolutely oppose the American imperialist elements' continued assistance to Chiang in the civil war, and we must smash the American's sinister plot to turn China into a Latin America. At the Taiyue District Culture, Education, and Journalism Representatives Conference held here a few days ago, all the representatives unanimously expressed their indignation at the American imperialists' armed intervention in China's internal affairs. Zhang Li, a representative of the Taiyue Militia News, said: During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Taiyue District militia risked their lives to rush into the enemy area and rescue countless American airmen who had crashed, which shows that we attach importance to Sino-American friendship, but today the American reactionaries are repaying kindness with malice, using the Kuomintang dictatorial government to enslave the Chinese people, which we can never tolerate! Gao Yanliu, an old educator from western Henan of the Henan Democratic National Construction Association, said: "We resolutely oppose the United States' continued aid to Chiang in the civil war, resolutely demand the withdrawal of American troops from China, and demand the recall of all military aid to Chiang Kai-shek.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st: People from all walks of life in the liberated areas supported Chairman Mao's statement on the 22nd of last month opposing American military assistance to the Kuomintang dictatorial government, and issued talks one after another, condemning the American imperialist policy towards China. Mr. Dai Zhen, chairman of the Harbin Railway General Trade Union, representing 10,000 railway workers in Harbin, said: "The CCP's demand for the United States to stop military aid to Chiang, as put forward in Chairman Mao's statement, fully meets the requirements of the entire Chinese people, except for a few fascists. If the United States continues to support Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war, using American guns and bullets to slaughter the Chinese people, then we will hate the United States as much as we hated Japan in the past!" Three gentlemen from the Northeast cultural circles, Zhu Fan, Chen Di, and Li Zisong, unanimously believed that the reactionaries dared to attack the Northeast as a result of American armed support, and we, the people, must use our own strength to promote the United States to abandon its wrong policy. Zhang Dexiang, a coachman in Harbin, said: "Chairman Mao's meaning is righteous and confident, and it is for the sake of our Chinese people to fight for justice." Mr. Liu Shaobai, vice chairman of the Shanxi-Suiyuan Border Region Senate, said with indignation: "The American authorities' assistance to Chiang in carrying out the civil war will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people." Mr. An Liangcheng, President of the Border Region Higher Court, denounced the American authorities' military assistance not during the War of Resistance, but after the victory, proving that the American authorities' intention is to enslave China. "Mr. Le Zhiru, Director of the Construction Department of the Border Region Administrative Office, said: "The American authorities' policy today is incomprehensible to the Chinese people. The American imperialist elements' attempt to turn China into a second Philippines will never succeed." Yang Chao, secretary of the Qingjiang City Party Committee of the Jiangsu-Anhui Border Region, said: "Chairman Mao's statement represents the righteous voice of the Chinese people and is a concentrated reflection of world opinion that loves peace and democracy and respects the independence of all nations. We fully support Chairman Mao's statement and are willing to fight to the end for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation." Yang Liqun, deputy director of the City Women's Federation, representing more than 60,000 women in Qingjiang City, expressed her firm support for Chairman Mao's statement. Wang Yubao, a representative of the dockworkers, said angrily: "The Kuomintang reactionaries are wholeheartedly determined to fight the civil war, mainly to insist on dictatorship." Hong Bingyan, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, believes: "Family affairs do not need to be managed by outsiders. If the Kuomintang reactionaries continue to rely on American power to fight, it will cause shops to close, and the business community will certainly not allow the reactionaries to act recklessly like this."
