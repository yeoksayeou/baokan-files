Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd. It is reported that the third atomic energy test of certain American imperialist elements to intimidate the world was held on the 1st on Bikini Island in the Pacific. The general impression is one of "disappointment." Murray, a correspondent for the American Columbia Broadcasting Corporation, reported on the 2nd after flying low for an hour to observe carefully: This was quite a failure. U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Blandy, who was in charge of the command, also said: "This atomic bomb explosion was not as spectacular as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The ships targeted in the Bikini Lagoon suffered less damage, and the height of the mushroom cloud after the atomic bomb explosion, 35,000 feet, was also about half of the estimated height after the Nagasaki bombing. Several goats and pigs used for testing are still alive." It is said that the old battleship "Nevada," which was the central target, suffered only superficial damage and was not sunk into the sea as predicted. Professor Redgen of Cambridge Harvard University said, based on the reaction of his seismograph: "Compared with earthquakes, this explosion is like a sneeze compared to a storm." According to various reports, 73 aircraft and 200 ships participated in this test, half of which were used as targets, including American aircraft carriers, battleships, submarines, and ships seized from Germany and Japan. The participating personnel included 41,100 U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force personnel, 550 scientists and technicians, and 200 reporters and photographers. The countries invited to observe were Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China, all of whom are members of the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission.

　　美原子能试验成绩不佳
    【新华社延安三日电】据悉：美国某些帝国主义分子威吓世界之原子能第三次试验，已于一日在太平洋比基尼岛上举行，一般之印象颇感“失望”。美国哥伦比亚广播公司通讯员慕拉于二日乘机低飞一小时，细细观察后之报告称：此次颇为失败。负责指挥之美海军中将布兰地亦称：“此次原子弹爆炸，不若日本偷袭珍珠港一役之壮观，比基尼礁湖海面作为目标之船舰，其所受损害亦较微少，而原子弹爆炸后烟云上升之高度三万五千英尺，亦约为长崎投弹后所估计高度之半。若干供试验之山羊及猪依然生存”。据称：作为中心目标之旧主力舰“内华达号”仅受表面损伤，而未如所预言之炸沉入海。英国剑桥哈佛大学教授李德根，据其地震纪录仪器之反应称：“此次爆炸与地震相比，实喷嚏与暴风相类也”。据各方电称，参加此次试验之飞机达七十三架，船只共二百艘，其中一半充作目标，内有美国航空母舰、主力舰、潜艇等以及自德日手中夺来的船舰，参加的人员，计美海陆空人员四万一千一百人，科学家技术人员五百五十人，记者、摄影师二百人。被邀参观的国家，有澳、巴、加、埃、法、墨、荷、波、苏、英、中等十一国，俱系参加联合国原子能管制委员会者。
