Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 27th: After the liberation of Tai'an on the 10th, the people in the city were overjoyed and the peaceful order was quickly established. The democratic county government, on the next day, together with the military and civilians, demolished the pillboxes and fortifications occupied by the puppet troops. The traitors and puppet soldiers who had hidden in the civilian population out of fear of punishment, of which 400 have already been found, are now being dealt with by the county judicial organs together with the people's representatives. The county government allows personnel of the puppet organizations who have committed serious crimes to repent and start anew. More than 300 wounded and sick soldiers left behind by the puppet army have received good care and treatment from the democratic government. The people in the urban area are holding various gatherings to celebrate the liberation and launch the anti-traitor liquidation. Shops of all kinds have successively opened and resumed business. The conspicuous slogan on the wall, "Persist in Peace, Strive for Democracy, Develop Industry and Commerce," shows that the liberated city of Tai'an is moving towards a new life.

Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 2nd: After the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army entered Shuoxian City, the democratic county government followed and began working in the city, comforting and visiting the suffering compatriots from house to house, and distributing grain and funds for relief. On the 19th, the masses in the four districts of the city held celebration rallies, pouring out their grievances and exposing the crimes of the Yan puppet Japanese army in oppressing the people. The people of Northwest Street jointly submitted a letter of accusation to the government, demanding the liquidation of the blood debts of traitors and secret agents, and voluntarily assisted the government in investigating hidden traitors and puppets. Various businesses have resumed operations one after another. The electric light company and railway station, which were destroyed by the Yan puppets, are being actively repaired, and electricity and trains will be running soon. The Trade Bureau transported a large amount of grain and necessities to supply the residents with food. Social order has been rapidly established, presenting a new picture of peace and tranquility. The masses are vying to comfort the troops. The Dongbao Administrative Village has sent a delegation to the front line to comfort the soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 7th: The masses in Shuoxian city and countryside, recently liberated by the Eighth Route Army from the puppet army, are actively engaged in restoring production and construction under the leadership of the democratic government. The masses in the city democratically elected the municipal government and the street chiefs of the four streets. Most of the more than 300 shops have started business, and customers are crowded. The machines in the North Street Power Plant were intact under the protection of the workers, and 15,500 electric lights shine brightly. The lives of the workers have been improved. Engineer Li Maocai, who participated in the "February 7th" General Strike, is now designing to build an electric mill. Railway workers have organized a trade union and a self-defense force to build road day and night, preparing to restore traffic. Farmers in the four townships are now reclaiming the land that has been wasteland due to the tyrannical "soldier-farmer integration" policy of the Yan puppets, with great enthusiasm. The Trade Bureau is transporting a large amount of buckwheat grain seeds from the old liberated areas to supply the masses.
