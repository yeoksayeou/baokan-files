How to Resolve the Contradiction Between Participation in War and Production?
    ——The Experience of Bian Gong (Mutual Aid Labor) between the Front and Rear in Pingshun
    Because production tasks such as weeding seedlings, summer harvesting, and late planting are proceeding simultaneously, and because the militia participating in the war have already departed or are preparing to depart, a contradiction has arisen between production and participation in the war. Delaying weeding will lead to land becoming barren; delaying wheat harvesting risks damage from hail; and the land of militia participating in the war urgently needs to be cultivated on their behalf. If we do not organize labor well and cadres do not provide strict division of labor and mutual aid between the front and rear, it will be impossible or very difficult to resolve this contradiction.
    I. Labor Organization and Leadership of Bian Gong between the Front and Rear
    The Bian Gong (mutual aid labor) between the front and rear has been widely discussed by cadres and the masses in various villages. Bian Gong committees have been established successively, methods for converting labor days have been established, and unified labor tickets are used. For example, the Bian Gong committees in various villages in the Fourth District include the village chief, political director, Farmers' Association chairman, civil affairs director, etc., who are responsible for the issues of preferential treatment for families of those resisting the enemy, participating in the war, supporting the front, providing labor, and the Bian Gong (mutual aid labor). They uniformly issue war participation labor tickets. The militia participating in the war are credited with labor days based on the amount of labor they can provide. Generally, they are credited with ten points; the government does not provide fifteen points. Niuling credits ten points for participating in the war, and the person cultivating on their behalf does not get meals. In Dong'anshan in the Fifth District, participating in the war is credited with seven jin of rice per day, while mutual aid cultivation is credited with four jin of rice. Each village sets its own specific conditions. Moreover, in order to overcome the difficulties of militia participating in the war lacking shoes or clothing, women also engage in mutual aid labor. For example, more than fifty women in Yuantou and Nanzhuang in the Third District made twenty-six pairs of shoes and sewed fifteen pieces of clothing for the militia in five days. Priority is given to providing for the needs of militia participating in the war. Shouquan in the Seventh District has already weeded the land for the militia participating in the war.
    II. Life Arrangements and Cadre Division of Labor
    The specific allocation of labor and time and the division of labor and leadership by village cadres are indeed major matters. Cadres and the masses in Shicheng felt that life was strained and labor was lacking, so they proposed a general mobilization of the entire village. Male laborers weeded seedlings, and every afternoon people were drawn to carry wheat yard cloth bags. Female laborers went to the fields to harvest wheat and thresh. Men, women and children also participated in harvesting wheat. Semi-laborers drove livestock to transport wheat and deliver manure. Houbi and Nanzhuang weeded seedlings during the day and harvested wheat at night. In Wangzhuang, because the militia were participating in the war, and fearing that the seedlings would be neglected, women participated in pulling seedlings and harvesting wheat. Male laborers weeded seedlings and carried wheat home. Children and wives stayed at home to guard the door. The method of converting labor days: pulling one mu of rice is credited with fifteen points, corn is credited with five points, etc. In short, in the leadership of cadres, it is necessary to clearly divide labor and organize full and semi-laborers, women and children to participate in this very intense production movement of weeding seedlings and summer harvesting, which is the basic key to completing the task and resolving the contradiction.

　　如何解决参战与生产矛盾？
    ——平顺组织前后方变工经验
    由于生产上锄苗、夏收、晚种等工作同时并进，又加以参战民兵已经出发和准备出发，因此，生产与参战工作发生了矛盾。锄苗误了要荒地，麦收晚了怕冰打，参战民兵土地又急需代耕照顾，这里若不很好组织劳力，干部领导上严密分工。前后方进行变工，是无法或很难解决这个矛盾的。
    一、前后方变工的劳力组织与领导
    前后方变工，各村已普遍经过干部群众讨论，先后成立变工委员会，规定了折工办法，统一使用工票。如四区各村变工委员会，有村长、政治主任、农会主席、民事主任等参加，分负优抗参战支差变工问题，统一制发参战工票。民兵参战，按劳力多寡进行了折工，一般的顶十分，政府不供给折十五分。牛岭就是参战折十分，给代耕的不管饭，而五区东安善是参战一天折七斤米，互助代耕折四斤米。各村看具体条件规定。而且为了克服参战民兵没鞋或没衣服的困难，妇女也进行互助变工。如三区源头、南庄五十多个妇女，五天给民兵做鞋二十六双，缝衣服十五件。参战民兵的生活都先来给做。七区首泉已给参战民兵锄完了地。
    二、生活安排与干部分工
    具体的劳力、时间的分配与村干部的分工领导确是件大事。石城干部群众感到生活紧张，劳力欠缺，提出全村总动员，男劳力锄苗，每天下午抽人背麦场布袋，女劳力上地割麦子打场，男女儿童也参加割麦，半劳力，赶牲口运麦、送粪。后壁、南庄则白天锄苗黑夜割麦。王庄，由于民兵参战，怕荒了苗，妇女参加拔苗割麦，男劳力锄苗往家背麦，小孩老婆在家看门，折工办法：拔一亩谷折十五分，玉米五分等，总之，在干部领导上必须明确分工，组织全、半劳力，妇女儿童参加这个锄苗、夏收很紧张的生产运动，是完成任务，解决矛盾的基本关键。
