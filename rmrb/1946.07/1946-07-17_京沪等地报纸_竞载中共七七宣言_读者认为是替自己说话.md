Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: On the "July 7th" anniversary, apart from the usual meetings and the newspapers publishing special supplements as usual, there was no vitality in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. Most newspapers expressed feelings of disappointment and frustration to varying degrees. The literary supplement of Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao planned to publish a special supplement and solicited articles from many writers. One writer replied in a letter, fundamentally opposing the celebration. After the original letter was published, it aroused much sympathy. In more than half of the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers, the four urgent appeals from the CCP Central Committee's declaration were published. Because Nanjing's Xinmin Bao published these four demands, many readers asked to buy the newspaper before it was fully distributed. They said, "We don't want to read the special supplements, we just want to read the CCP declaration." Some civil servants, after reading the main points of the declaration, said happily, "The Communist Party is speaking for us." A radio station automatically broadcast the main points of the declaration five times. Some people who heard the broadcast said, "It's extremely exciting. Chiang Kai-shek has broken precedent this year by not issuing the long statement he had long planned to release."

　　京沪等地报纸
    竞载中共七七宣言
    读者认为是替自己说话
    【新华社南京十四日电】“七七”纪念日，京沪各地除了照例开会庆祝，报纸照例出增刊而外，没有一点生气，大部分报纸或多或少表示出失望与苦闷之情绪。上海大公报的文艺副刊拟出增刊，向许多作家征文，有一位作家复信，根本反对庆祝，原信发表后，引起许多同情。在半数以上的京沪报纸中，发表了中共中央宣言中的四项紧急呼吁，南京新民报因为刊布了这四项要求，很多读者不等报纸出齐即要求卖报，他们说：“我们并不要看增刊，只要看看中共宣言就行”。有些公务员看了宣言的要点愉快的说：“共产党倒替我们讲话”。有一个广播电台自动把宣言要点广播了五次，有些听到广播的人说：“真兴奋极了，蒋介石今年破天荒没有发表早已预定要发表的长篇文告。”
