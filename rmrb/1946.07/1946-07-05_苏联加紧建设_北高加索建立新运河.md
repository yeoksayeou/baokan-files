　　Soviet Union Intensifies Construction
    New Canal Established in the North Caucasus
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Moscow dispatch: In order to rapidly complete the agricultural plan in the new Five-Year Plan, the North Caucasus has begun construction of the Novinomelik Canal—one of the largest irrigation projects in the current Five-Year Plan. The canal will connect with the Kuban and Yegorlyk rivers, and can irrigate 25,000 acres of collective farm land in the Yegorlyk region. Two hydroelectric power stations are located on the canal, one of which is already completed. Reconstruction of the huge reservoir in the Charavshan River basin of the Uzbek Republic has resumed. This is one of the largest reservoirs in the Soviet Union, with a capacity of 600 million cubic meters of water. The irrigation transport network in the Kazakh Republic has increased by 19,000 kilometers, with more than 1,000 pumping stations, over 400 sluice gates, and 2,240 large irrigation machines established. 460 million rubles have been invested in Kazakh irrigation, which will increase farmers' irrigated land by 58,000 hectares. By 1950, colleges and schools will train 400,000 experts, twice the pre-war number, and will train 2.3 million tractor and combine harvester drivers.
