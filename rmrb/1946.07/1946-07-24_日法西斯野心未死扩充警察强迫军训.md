　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th -- Tokyo dispatch: Home Minister of the Yoshida Cabinet, Oomura Seiichi, declared in parliament on the 18th that 15 million yen in the financial budget currently being discussed by the parliament will be used to expand the police force and improve the treatment of police officers. Oomura admitted that "the current number of police officers is greater than that of the occupying forces, but he still insists that the police organization must be expanded." Oomura also revealed the misdeeds of the Japanese police, saying: "Under conditions of inflation, it is difficult for the police to remain honest. Recently, police officers have arbitrarily extorted and blackmailed people, which has aroused public outrage."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st -- Tokyo dispatch: It has recently been discovered that some schools in Japan are still implementing forced military training. Several hundred students at a certain agricultural school in Urawa, thirteen miles north of Tokyo, recently held a major strike to protest against forced military training. According to reports, the school authorities, in order to prevent the leakage of military training information, detained several student leaders, which aroused student resentment. More than 20 students took the lead in leaving the school, followed by more than 80 students. The remaining students then began a strike, demanding the removal of the principal and the democratization of the school curriculum.

　　日法西斯野心未死扩充警察强迫军训
    【新华社延安二十日电】东京讯：吉田内阁内务大臣大村清一，于十八日议会中宣称：目前议会所讨论的财政预算中，有一千五百万元将用来扩充警察和改善警察的待遇。大村承认“目前警察数目大于占领军，但他仍主张非扩充警察组织不可”。大村亦透露日警察的劣迹，他说：“在通货膨胀的条件下，警察要保持廉洁是困难的，最近警察任意勒索敲诈，已引起社会愤慨”。
    【新华社延安二十一日电】东京讯：最近发现日本仍有若干学校实行强迫军训。东京北十三英里的浦和某农校学生数百人，日前为反对强迫军训而举行大罢课。据报载，该校当局为防走漏军训消息，曾掌握学生领袖数人，致引起学生之愤懑，当有学生二十余人领先离校，继之离校者八十余人。其余学生即开始罢课，罢课学生要求撤换校长并将学校课程民主化。
