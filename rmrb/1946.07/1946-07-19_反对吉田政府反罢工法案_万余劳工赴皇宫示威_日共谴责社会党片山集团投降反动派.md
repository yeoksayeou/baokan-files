Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Tokyo dispatch: Over ten thousand representatives of major Japanese labor unions gathered at the Imperial Palace yesterday to hold a mass rally opposing the anti-strike bill formulated by the Yoshida government. The assembly passed a declaration denouncing the Yoshida Cabinet as the running dogs of the Zaibatsu, and demanding that MacArthur implement the Potsdam Declaration, dismiss the reactionary Yoshida Cabinet, and establish a democratic government. Afterwards, a grand demonstration and march were held. Allied Headquarters, in coordination with the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, dispatched a large number of military police to defend the Yoshida official residence, prohibiting the demonstration from going to petition. On the same day, the employees of the Yomiuri Shimbun continued their strike, issuing a declaration accusing the company president, Baba, of violating the Trade Union Law, neglecting employee welfare, and arbitrarily dismissing striking workers. They also petitioned the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, demanding that it stop President Baba's illegal acts.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: According to Tokyo Broadcasting: Japanese Communist Party spokesman, Ito Ritsu, issued a statement yesterday condemning the Socialist Party's leadership group, headed by Katayama Tetsu, for breaking faith, undermining party unity, and splitting the democratic front. Ito pointed out: "The Socialist Party's leadership group has thrown itself into the arms of the reactionaries, tearing up the sacred alliance between the Socialist and Communist Parties, and openly declaring the termination of all negotiations between the two parties regarding the establishment of a democratic national salvation alliance." Ito also warned the Socialist Party: "If it does not change course, it will be spurned by the people." The Democratic National Salvation Alliance is an organization of the democratic front proposed by the Japanese Communist Party, with the mission of "realizing democracy and saving the motherland." This proposal by the Japanese Communist Party won the support of the Socialist Party's left-wing leaders and the broad masses of party members, forcing the leadership, composed of Katayama Tetsu's centrist and right-wing factions, to negotiate with the Japanese Communist Party. However, during the negotiations, the Socialist Party representatives adopted delaying tactics, attempting to avoid signing agreements on concrete issues. At the same time, under the instigation of right-wing elements, Katayama Tetsu accepted proposals from the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party, demanding compromise from the two parties in order to pass the current constitution in parliament. On the 13th, the leaders of the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party held a joint meeting, deciding to make concessions to the Socialist Party, agreeing to include Socialist Party members in government institutions after the constitution is passed. Because the passage of the constitution in the House of Representatives requires a two-thirds majority of the 466 seats in the House. Currently, due to the impact of the purge order, or through bribery and enticement, the number of seats held by each party has fluctuated. The Liberal Party currently has 142 seats, the Progressive Party has 102 seats, the Socialist Party has 99 seats, and the Cooperative Democratic Party has increased to 44 seats. Therefore, Yoshida Shigeru expects that when the constitution is passed, in addition to obtaining all the votes of the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party, he will also need the support of the Socialist Party's center-right (which holds 89 seats) or the Cooperative Democratic Party in order to pass it. However, in the past, the right-wing of the Socialist Party was opposed to Yoshida Shigeru's coalition cabinet with the Progressive Party, and made things difficult for Yoshida in the deliberation of the constitution. Now, because the Liberal Party and the Progressive Party have agreed to make concessions, the leadership of the Socialist Party announced on the 14th that it would terminate negotiations with the Japanese Communist Party.

　　反对吉田政府反罢工法案
    万余劳工赴皇宫示威
    日共谴责社会党片山集团投降反动派
    【新华社延安十六日电】东京讯：日本各大工会代表一万数千名，于昨日集合于皇宫，举行群众大会，反对吉田政府所制定的反罢工法案。大会通过宣言，斥责吉田内阁为财阀走狗，并要求麦克阿瑟实践波茨顿宣言，罢黜吉田反动内阁，成立民主政府。会后并举行盛大示威游行。盟军总部协同东京警署派出大批军事警察，防卫吉田官邸，禁止示威队伍前去请愿。同日，读卖新闻社员工继续罢工，发表宣言，指责该社长马场破坏职工会法，彼忽略员工福利，擅自开除罢工人员。并向东京警署请愿，要求制止社长马场的不法行为。
    【新华社延安十六日电】据东京广播：日本共产党发言人伊藤律于昨天发表谈话，谴责社会党以片山哲为首的领导集团，背信弃义，破坏两党团结，分裂民主阵线。伊藤指出：“社会党的领导集团，已投到反动派的怀抱，撕毁社共两党神圣的缔盟，公然声言终止两党关于成立民主救国同胞的一切谈判”。伊藤并警告社会党：“如果不改弦更张，将为人民所唾弃”。按民主救国同盟，为日共所建议的民主阵线的组织，任务为：“实现民主，挽救祖国”。日共此建议，曾博得社会党左派领袖与广大党员群众的拥护，使该党片山哲为首的中派与右派结合组成的首脑部，被迫与日共进行谈判，但在谈判中，社会党代表却采取拖宕态度，对具体问题，力图避免签订协定。同时在右派分子的怂恿下，片山哲并接受自由党、进步党的提议，要求二党的妥协，以便通过目前议会中的宪法。十三日，自由党与进步党的首脑部曾召开联席会，决定对社会党让步，同意在通过宪法后，政府机构中将容纳社会党分子。因为众院通过宪法，必须有全院四百六十六票中的三分之二通过，才能成立。而目前受清洗令影响，或因拉拢收买，各党议席有所消长，自由党现有一四二席，进步党有一百另二席，社会党有九十九席，协同民主党已增至四十四席，因此吉田茂预料届时宪法通过，除获得进步党、自由党全体票数外，还须社会党中右派（他们占有八十九席）或协同民主党的支持，才能通过。然而，过去社会党右派因不满吉田茂联合进步党组阁，而居于反对党地位，在审议宪法问题上，与吉田为难。现因自由党与进步党已同意让步，故该党领导集团于十四日宣布与日共终止谈判。
