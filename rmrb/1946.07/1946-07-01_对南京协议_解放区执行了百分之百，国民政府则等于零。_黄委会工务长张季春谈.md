　　Regarding the Nanjing Agreement:
    The Liberated Areas Implemented 100%, While the National Government Implemented Zero.
    Remarks by Zhang Jichun, Chief of Engineering of the Yellow River Commission
    [Heze News from this Newspaper] Tad, consultant of the Kaifeng Yellow River Commission, along with six personnel from UNRRA, arrived in Heze from Bian on the 20th for the second time. They, together with Fan Gege (a Canadian), a UNRRA and Yellow River Commission specialist, and Zhang Jichun, Chief of Engineering of the Yellow River Commission, inspected the dike restoration situation downstream of the Linpu District.  After inspecting more than twenty *li* along the dike, they observed that all ten thousand workers were sweating profusely and working intensely to restore the dike. Tad and others expressed their admiration for the liberated area government's faithful implementation of the Nanjing Agreement and the masses' enthusiastic work spirit. Mr. Fan Gege and Mr. Zhang Jichun had just returned from inspecting the entire line of dike restoration in the JiluYu and Bohai regions. Mr. Fan stated: "The situation seen along the coast is the same, only the dike restoration project in the Kuomintang area near Jinan has not yet started." Mr. Fan also pointed out: "If this section is not restored, the Bohai region will definitely suffer a water disaster." Mr. Zhang Jichun, based on his personal observations, made a fair comment on the degree to which all parties implemented the Nanjing Agreement, saying: "The liberated areas implemented 100%, UNRRA implemented 50% due to objective difficulties, while the Kuomintang government implemented zero."

　　对南京协议
    解放区执行了百分之百，国民政府则等于零。
    黄委会工务长张季春谈
    【本报荷泽讯】开封黄委会顾问塔德，偕同联总人员六人于二十日再度由汴抵荷，会同联总兼黄委会专门委员范铬德（加拿大人）黄委会工务长张季春等，视察临濮区以下复堤情形。沿堤视察二十余里，全线千万工人均正汗流夹背，紧张复堤，塔德等对解放区政府忠实执行南京协议及群众积极作工之精神，表示赞佩。范铬德、张季春二氏系视察冀鲁豫区及渤海区之全线复堤情形刚刚归来，范氏称：沿岸所见情形均是如此，仅济南附近国民党区之复堤工程还未动工。范氏并指出：如该段不复堤，则渤海区定漕水灾。张季春先生就其身历目睹之情形，对各方执行南京协议之程度加以公正评论称：“解放区执行百分之百，联总因客观困难之阻碍，执行了百分之五十，至国民党政府则等于零。”
