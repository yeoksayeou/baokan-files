Xinhua News Agency, Huimin, 30th: Li Renfeng, Director of the Bohai Liberated Area Administrative Office in Shandong, has sent a telegram to Zhao Rannan, Commissioner of the Yellow River Commission in Kaifeng, and Kong Lingkun, Director of the Shandong Repair and Prevention Office of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, strongly protesting the incident in which Kuomintang authorities in Jinan instructed secret agents to illegally detain Liu Jiqing, our Yellow River management representative, and seize Yellow River management surveying instruments. He put forward four points: (1) Our representative, Liu Jiqing, was invited by Director Kong Lingkun and Engineer Tao Shuzeng to attend the Yellow River management meetings in Heze and Kaifeng. This time, he was ordered to return to Huimin to convey the mission, which was of utmost importance. However, he was detained on June 10th and imprisoned for as long as eleven days before escaping. The Kuomintang authorities in Jinan should bear full responsibility for the loss of time and technical resources in river repair. (2) The Jinan authorities should be ordered to return the stolen jeep, two water dyke instruments, various other measuring tools, and a map of the Yellow River within days to facilitate work. (3) The Kuomintang authorities in Jinan have repeatedly dispatched cavalry agents to threaten and shoot at our Yellow River management personnel and the masses. Now, they have even detained our Yellow River management representative. Such illegal and violent acts should be stopped, and the Jinan authorities should be telegraphed to admit their mistakes to the people and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. (4) It is suggested that the Yellow River Commission establish an executive group including representatives from all parties in Jinan, delineate the sections of the dike that the Jinan authorities should repair, and order them to start work quickly.
