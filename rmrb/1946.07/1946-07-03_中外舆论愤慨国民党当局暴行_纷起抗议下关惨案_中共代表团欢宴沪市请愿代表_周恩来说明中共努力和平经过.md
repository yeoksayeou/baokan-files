Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th—Domestic and foreign public opinion circles have erupted in protest against the Kuomintang authorities' creation of the Xiaguan Massacre. All staff members of the Nanjing New Democracy organization sent a letter to Wu Dingchang, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang government, lodging a serious protest. Shanghai's Wenhui Bao published an editorial, expressing a serious protest to the authorities. Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao also published a short commentary, "Oppose Beating People." Nanjing's Nanjing Renbao, Nanjing Wanbao, and Shanghai's Shishi Xinbao, Lianhe Wanbao, and Wenhua Bao all provided truthful reports of the massacre's events. Nanjing Renbao even used the six characters "Today, No Words to Say" as a short commentary, expressing extreme indignation. Reporters from foreign news agencies such as the Associated Press, United Press, International News Service, and Agence France-Presse all reported the eyewitness accounts of the massacre to overseas audiences in detail. They indicated that there were three points they could testify to: (1) The thugs committing the violence were all well-dressed and acted in an organized manner, with no "refugees" mixed among them. (2) Military police present at the scene did not interfere at any point during the thugs' violence, deliberately allowing it to happen. (3) None of those beaten were Communist Party members. Simultaneously, the foreign reporters have jointly submitted a memorandum regarding this massacre to Marshall. Amidst the rising tide of public opinion protests, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department hurriedly convened the heads of various pro-government newspapers at 4:00 PM on the 24th, instructing them on three points: First, deny that Ma Xulun and others were representatives of the Shanghai people. Second, the petition was a "CCP conspiracy." Third, the special agents responsible for the violence should be uniformly referred to as "Northern Jiangsu refugees" in external propaganda. At the same time, other civilian newspapers were threatened and "advised." However, this kind of suppression cannot eliminate the just voices of the Nanjing press. On the 24th, Xinmin Bao published the truth of the massacre in nearly one-third of its pages, along with an editorial entitled "Beating is Not the Solution," expressing its protest.

Xinhua News Agency, Huaibei, 29th—The Suwan Border Region Provisional Assembly and cultural, educational, and news circles have sent telegrams across the country, lodging a serious protest against the Nanjing Massacre created by the Kuomintang authorities and expressing condolences and support to the representatives of all circles in Shanghai appealing for peace. The telegram from the Provisional Assembly pointed out: "This is a magnified re-enactment of the Chongqing Jiaochangkou and Beiping Zhongshan Park incidents in the dignified capital, another proof that the Kuomintang fascist faction is launching a civil war and insisting on dictatorship."

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 30th—The Nanjing CCP delegation, including Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, hosted a banquet at 7:00 PM on the 25th at No. 17 Meiyuan New Village for the Shanghai representatives from all walks of life petitioning against the civil war. Except for Ma Xulun, Yan Baohang and others, who were unable to attend due to injuries, all other representatives attended and expressed their desire for peace. Zhou Enlai then gave a general explanation of the CCP's consistent efforts for peace and democracy, and elaborated on the CCP's various policies regarding land, industry, and commerce.
