Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. The Liberation Daily published an editorial today entitled "The Nanjing Massacre," the original text of which is as follows:
On the evening of June 23rd, a shocking bloody massacre occurred in Nanjing, the capital of the Nationalist government. The perpetrators were a group of fascist secret service thugs fostered by the Nationalist authorities, and the victims were Mr. Ma Xulun, Mr. Yan Baohang, and other representatives entrusted by people from all walks of life in Shanghai to petition in Nanjing and call for peace, as well as journalists covering the news. This massacre has aroused the righteous indignation of compatriots in the Nanjing-Shanghai area and across the country.
Under the firm demands of the people of the whole country, the Nationalist authorities issued an order to extend the ceasefire in the Northeast for eight days. However, within two days, before the ink on the order was dry, they immediately manufactured the Nanjing Massacre to tear up the ceasefire order. The representatives of the people from all walks of life in Shanghai demanded only eight characters: "Stop the civil war and realize peace." Their means were only peaceful petitions. But as long as you truly represent the people and truly demand peace, then the Nationalist authorities will regard you as "rebels" and "internal unrest" and must "denounce," "stop," and "pacify" you. In recent days, the Nationalist authorities' propaganda machine has been clamoring that this is a "government policy" that must be "absolutely supported." The Nanjing Massacre, like the Kunming Massacre in December of last year and other massacres, is a concrete manifestation of this "national policy." Its content is very simple: the Nationalist authorities regard all those who truly oppose the civil war and demand peace as thorns in their side, whom they must destroy and eliminate at all costs. Since the Nationalist authorities are intensifying the implementation of such a "national policy" that is hostile to all peace-loving people, then what sincerity do they have to implement any "ceasefire order"? The Nationalist authorities' propaganda organs are attempting to place the hat of "no sincerity for peace" on the head of the Chinese Communist Party, but the Nanjing Massacre proves that this hat only fits properly when worn by the Nationalist authorities themselves.
In order to cover up the truth of the Nanjing Massacre and hide the instigators of the massacre, the Nationalist authorities fabricated the absurd rumor of "conflicts between refugees from northern Jiangsu and petitioners," and afterwards dismissed the local police chief, demoted the head of the Xiaguan Police Bureau, and reprimanded Shen Cheng, the head of the Nanjing Police Department, in order to deal with the matter hastily and shirk responsibility. But everyone knows that in the heavily guarded "capital," those who dared to openly commit violence in disregard of the law were not "refugees," but fascist secret service thugs. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of special agents in China, large and small, and their chief is none other than the Chinese fascist dictator - Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek was in Nanjing when the massacre occurred. The Nanjing Massacre could absolutely not have happened without his instructions and the Nationalist authorities' meticulous prior arrangements. Just look at the many massacres in the past six months, such as the Kunming Massacre, the Cangbaitang Incident, the Jiaochangkou Bloodshed, the smashing of the Xinhua Daily and the Democratic Daily... Which massacre, which incident was not organized and carried out under his instructions by Chiang's confidants - Guan Linzheng, Fang Zhi, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Lifu and their ilk?! Wasn't the closure of the Liberation Daily in Beiping recently ordered personally by Chiang Kai-shek? The Nationalist authorities' tools for destroying the people's freedom include not only the military police, but also secret service agencies modeled after Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese fascists; after each massacre, the Nationalist authorities also have a set of methods to confuse the public and cover up their crimes. This is where the Nationalist authorities are more vicious, more insidious, and more sophisticated than the Northern Warlords. But the Chinese people are also smarter than before, and the Chinese people have the ability to identify who is the instigator of this series of massacres.
The Nanjing Massacre exposes the serious crisis in China created by the reactionaries within the Kuomintang. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, all industries are withering, the people are living in misery, special agents are rampant, and the people's lives and freedom are not guaranteed. Even the conservative-minded *Time* magazine published a dispatch calling the Kuomintang government an "evil government." Only in our liberated areas is production developing, the people's living standards are rising, and they fully enjoy democracy and freedom. No one picks up lost items on the road, and there are no robbers or beggars. But today, the Nationalist authorities are slandering the "internal unrest" in the liberated areas. Today, the Nationalist authorities are relying on foreign forces, on the one hand, they are more ruthlessly plundering the fat and blood of the people in their controlled areas, and strengthening fascist terror, accelerating the destruction of social order, and more cruelly suppressing the people's anti-civil war and anti-dictatorship movement; on the other hand, they are persisting in the civil war, and actively making deployments to expand the civil war, attempting to destroy the liberated areas and plunge the whole country into an unprecedented abyss of blood. The Nationalist authorities are tearing up the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in this way, and are doing their utmost to create an unprecedented "internal unrest" in China. Therefore, the Nanjing Massacre and the current serious crisis should greatly heighten the vigilance of the Chinese people, eliminate the bloody conspiracy of the fascist reactionaries, and greatly enhance the united efforts of the Chinese people to smash this conspiracy.
The anti-civil war marches by the masses in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and other places mark the vigorous development of the Chinese people's movement against civil war and dictatorship, demanding peace and democracy, and opposing the interference of the US authorities in China's internal affairs. The fascist reactionaries want to suppress this great movement, and they will inevitably suffer a painful defeat.
We extend our warm sympathy and cordial greetings to the representatives of the Shanghai people's organizations and the injured journalists. The demands of the Shanghai people are also the demands of the whole country. This demand - to establish an independent, free, democratic, and prosperous new China - will certainly be realized, no matter how many twists and turns it may take.

    没有特务总头子蒋介石的指示南京惨案是绝对不可能发生的
    【新华社延安二十六日电】本日解放日报发表社论，题为“南京惨案”，原文如下：
    六月二十三日晚，在国民党政府的首都——南京，发生了震动全国的流血惨案。行凶的是国民党当局所豢养的一群法西斯特务暴徒，被殴的是受上海各界人民委托，晋京请愿，呼吁和平的代表——马叙伦、阎宝航诸先生，和采访新闻的记者。这一惨案已经激起了京沪一带和全国同胞的义愤。
    国民党当局在全国人民坚决要求之下，发布了将东北停战令延长八天的命令。但是不出两天，命令的黑沈未干，它马上制造一个南京惨案，来撕毁这个停战令。上海各界人民的代表们所要求的，仅仅是停止内战，实现和平八个大字。他们的手段，仅仅是和平请愿。但是只要你真正代表人民说话，真正要求和平，那末，国民党当局就认你是“叛逆”和“内乱”，必须加以“声讨”“制止”和“平定”。这几天来，国民党当局的御用团体，就大喊大叫说，这是“政府国策”非“绝对拥护”不可。南京惨案，和去年十二月的昆明惨案，及其他惨案一样，正是这种“国策”的再次具体表现。它的内容十分简单，就是凡是真正反对内战，要求和平的人，国民党当局都把他们看作眼中钉，必欲摧残之消灭之而后快。国民党当局既然变本加厉地推行这样一个与一切和平人士为敌的“国策”，那么它还有什么诚意来实行什么“停战令”呢？！国民党当局的宣传机关，正在妄图把“和平毫无诚意”的帽子，加在中国共产党的头上，但南京惨案证明，这顶帽子只有国民党当局自己戴起来，才是恰合头寸。
    为了掩盖南京惨案的真相，和隐藏惨案的主使者，国民党当局伪造了“苏北难民与请愿者冲突”的荒谬谣言，并在事后把当地警察所长撤职，下关警察局长记过，南京警察厅长申诚一番，以便草草了事推卸责任。但是谁都知道，在警卫森严的“首都”，敢于目无法纪公开行凶的，不是什么“难民”，而是法西斯特务暴徒。在今天中国特务分子大大小小一共有几十万，他们的总头子不是别人，正是中国法西斯独裁者——蒋介石。惨案发生的时候，蒋介石就在南京。没有他的指示，和国民党当局的事前周密布置，南京惨案是绝对不可能发生的。试看半年多来的许多惨案，如昆明惨案、沧白堂事件、较场口血案、捣毁新华日报民主报事件……那一个惨案那一个事件不是由蒋之亲信——关麟征、方治、谷正纲、陈立夫之流，在他的指示下组织进行？！最近北平的解放报的被封闭，还不是蒋介石亲自下了电令吗？国民党当局摧残人民自由的工具，不仅有军警，而且还有效法希特勒、莫索里尼与日本法西斯的特务机关；在每一次惨案之后，国民党当局还有一套混淆视听，掩盖罪行的办法。这是国民党当局，比北洋军阀更凶恶、更阴险、更精巧的地方。但是中国人民也比从前更聪明了，中国人民有能力识别这一连串惨案的主使者，究竟是谁。
    南京惨案揭露了国民党内反动派一手造成的中国严重危机。在国民党统治区，百业凋敝，民不聊生，特务横行，人民生命自由毫无保障。即素以保守著名之时代杂志，亦发表通讯，亦称国民党政府为“恶政府”。只有在我们解放区，则是生产发展，人民生活上升，充分享受民主自由，路不拾遗，盗匪乞丐绝迹。但是今天国民党当局，却正在诬蔑解放区的“内乱”。今天国民党当局正在依外力为靠山，一方面更无情的搜括其统治区人民脂膏，并加强法西斯恐怖，加速破坏社会秩序，更残酷地镇压人民的反内战反独裁的运动；另方面正在坚持内战，并积极的作扩大内战的部署，企图毁灭解放区，将全国推入空前的血海深渊。国民党当局这样撕毁了停战协定和政协决议，竭力制造中国的空前“内乱”。因此南京惨案和当前的严重危机，应当大大提高中国人民的警惕。肃清法西斯反动派的血腥大阴谋，并大大增强中国人民为了粉碎这一阴谋的团结的努力。
    苏、杭、沪等地的群众反内战游行，标志着中国人民反对内战独裁，要求和平民主，反对美国当局干涉中国内政的运动，正在蓬勃开展。法西斯反动派想要把这种伟大运动镇压下去，必然遭遇惨痛的失败。
    我们对上海人民团体的代表及受伤的记者，谨致热烈的同情，与亲切的慰问。上海人民的要求，也就是全国的要求。这要求——建立独立、自由、民主和富强的新中国，不管经过多少曲折，是一定要实现的。
