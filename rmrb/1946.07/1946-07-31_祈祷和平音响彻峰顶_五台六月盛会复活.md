　　Prayers for Peace Resound from the Summit
    The Grand Sixth Month Gathering of Mount Wutai Revived
    [Xinhua News Agency, Fuping, 28th] The renowned Sixth Month Grand Assembly of Mount Wutai, China's famous Buddhist holy site, has now been revived. Pilgrims from all over are enthusiastically flocking to the event. This Buddhist sacred site on Mount Qingliang, which had been desolate for many years, has seen its grandeur restored due to the rapid restoration of order and peace in the Jin-Ji area after its complete liberation by the Eighth Route Army. Mount Wutai is now filled with newly built shops and archways, and the seventy-plus temples scattered across the mountain peaks resound with prayers for peace and the elimination of war disasters. The Mongolian-Tibetan Buddhist Preparatory Committee recently convened a grand gathering, sending telegrams to Buddhist masters and devotees throughout the country, unanimously calling for peace and praying to stop the reactionary faction's crimes of indiscriminate killing and trampling on the lives of the people.
