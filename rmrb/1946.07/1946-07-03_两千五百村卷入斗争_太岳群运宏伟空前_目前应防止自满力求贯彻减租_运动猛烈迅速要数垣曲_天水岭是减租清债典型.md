[Report from This Newspaper] According to incomplete statistics, the mass movement in the Taiyue area involved 2,562 administrative villages and 529 natural villages (excluding three counties) across the region. This accounts for 82% of all villages. In the old liberated areas, with the exception of some areas that have shifted from investigation and reduction to large-scale production, the investigation and reduction process is still ongoing. In the newly liberated areas, based on the widespread development of speaking bitterness and seeking revenge, the movement is developing towards in-depth rent reduction and debt clearing. Jincheng, Changzhi, and other counties transitioned earlier and have already created many experiences in in-depth rent reduction and debt clearing, with Tianshuiling in Jincheng being a prominent example. (See the "Skinning" communication previously published in this newspaper for details.)

The scale, mass awareness, depth, breadth, rapidity, and intensity of this year's mass movement in the region have far exceeded any previous year. As cadres in Xiangling County said, "The mass movement can penetrate places that guns and cannons cannot reach." A characteristic of this year's mass movement in the old areas is the high level of mass awareness. When investigation and reduction began, the masses started it automatically without waiting for the cadres to go. In the past, cadres looked for the masses; this year, the masses rose up to do it themselves. Furthermore, it penetrated into mountain gullies, small villages, and backward elements. At the same time, on the basis of in-depth investigation and reduction, mass-based anti-espionage struggles were universally launched, and the masses automatically traced the roots. They said, "Spies don't fall from the sky; they have roots and branches, like pumpkin vines, in a series. The closer to the root, the bigger it is." As a result, the old roots of many spies were traced out by the masses. In the new areas, Yicheng, Xiangling, Yuanqu, Jiyuan, Changzi, and other places successively convened mass rallies of over ten thousand people to speak bitterness, seek revenge, publicly try traitors and war criminals, and mourn the unjustly deceased, boosting the morale of the masses and promoting the development of the movement. Yuanqu is foremost in the intensity and rapidity of the movement. Under the slogan of "Oppose the Sixty Jin" (those who worked for the enemy and puppets were given sixty jin of grain by the enemy and puppets), the vigorous mass movement developed throughout the county in forty days. The masses took swords, spears, and knives and ran hundreds of miles, even missing the New Year, to Wenxi and Xiaxian to arrest traitors and war criminals. The joint struggle of more than 6,000 people in Chengguan for four full days during the lunar New Year was a symbol of the climax of this movement. The masses themselves called it "political siege," comparing it to the military recovery of Yuanqu City. In the border areas, the masses broke through the conspiracies and armed suppression of landlords and special agents, adopting methods such as public propaganda, secret "collusion," underground brewing, joint village defense, mutual support, and arming themselves, so that the movement stretched all the way to five or six li away from the stubborn army.

In the future mass movement in the region, on the basis of anti-traitor and debt clearing, we should further deepen rent reduction and interest reduction, rent refunds and interest refunds, implement the mass line, and let go of mobilizing the masses, guiding the development of the movement to balance, universality, and depth, in order to achieve the purpose of fully mobilizing the masses. Therefore, we must overcome the current existing complacency, being satisfied with the vigorous anti-traitor liquidation, neglecting rent reduction and interest reduction, and mistakenly regarding rent and interest issues as "minor issues" that can be carried over. In terms of work style, we should emphasize thoroughness and meticulousness, going deep into mountain gullies, "unwilling to speak" people.

Finally, regarding the deviations that occur in the movement, the leadership should be good at discovering the correct things in the masses, praise and promote them, concentrate them, and implement them, so that the deviations can be gradually overcome and the movement will not be interrupted.

　　两千五百村卷入斗争
    太岳群运宏伟空前
    目前应防止自满力求贯彻减租
    运动猛烈迅速要数垣曲
    天水岭是减租清债典型
    【本报讯】太岳区的群众运动，据不完全统计：全区（缺三县）有二千五百六十二个行政村、五百二十九个自然村卷入了斗争。占全部村庄的百分之八十二，现老解放区除一部分地区由查减转入大生产运动外，余仍在继续进行查减。新解放区在诉苦复仇普遍开展的基础上，运动正向着深入减租清债方面发展。晋城、长十等县，转入较早，并已创造了许多深入减租清债的经验，而以晋城的天水岭为其突出的典型。（详见本报前载“揭皮”通讯）
    该区今年的群众运动，规模的宏大，群众的自觉，运动的深入广泛，迅速猛烈，均远超过已往任何一年。正如襄陵县的干部所说：“枪炮不能打到的地方，群众运动都能深入进去。”老区群众运动，今年的特点是群众自觉性高，当查减开始，群众不等干部去，即自动的搞起来了。过去是干部找群众，今年是群众自己起来干。再是深入到山沟小庄、落后分子中。同时在深入查减的基础上，普遍的开展了群众性的反特务斗争，群众自动的追根。他们说：“特务不是从天上掉下来的，也有根，也有梢，好比南瓜蔓，一连串，越离根近越大。”因之不少特务的老根，被群众追出来了。新区在翼城、襄陵、垣曲、济源、、长子等地，均先后召开了万人以上的诉苦复仇、公审汉奸战犯，与追悼屈死冤魂的群众大会，振奋了群众的情绪，推动运动的向前发展，运动的猛烈与迅速，首推垣曲，垣曲在“反六十斤”（凡给敌伪作事的，敌伪就给他六十斤粮食）的口号下。经过四十天的工夫，轰轰烈烈的群众运动在全县范围内发展起来。群众拿到宝剑、刀枪跑到几百里以外，连年也不过了，到闻喜来到夏县去捉汉奸、战犯、而阴历年关，城关六千余人整整四天的联合斗争，便是这一运动高潮的标志，群众自己叫作“政治攻城”，与军事收复垣曲城相提并论。在边沿地区群众冲破了地主特务分子的阴谋活动及武装镇压，采取了公开宣传、秘密“串通”、暗地酝酿、联村联防、互相声援、武装起来等办法，使运动一直伸展到离顽军五六里的地方。
    在该区今后的群众运动中，应从反奸清债的基础上，进一步的深入减租减息，退租退息，贯彻群众路线，放手发动群众的方针，把运动的发展引导到平衡、普遍、深入，以达到充分发动群众的目的。因此必须克服目前存在着的自满思想，满足于轰轰烈烈的反奸清算，忽视减租减息，错误的把租息问题看成了“小问题”，可以捎带过去的思想。在作风上应强调深入细致，要深入到山沟窝铺、“不啃气”的人中去。
    最后对运动中所发生的偏向，领导上应善于发现群众中正确的东西，加以表扬提倡，集中起来，贯彻下去，这样偏向便可逐渐克服，才不会使运动中断下来。
