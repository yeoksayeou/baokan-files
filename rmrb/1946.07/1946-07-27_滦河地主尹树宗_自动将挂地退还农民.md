Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 24th. Yin Shuzong, a landlord from the Second District of Luan River, moved by the Communist Party's land policy conforming to law, reason, and human sentiment, has voluntarily returned all 500 mu of leased land to the peasants. Mr. Yin was influenced by scientific and democratic thought during his middle school studies. He usually harbored a sense of revulsion toward the illegal acts of local gentry, bullies, and despots who harshly oppressed the peasants. After the liberation of Luan River last autumn, he extensively purchased Chairman Mao's various works for in-depth study, and often told his friends in the village: "The Communist Party's organization of rent reduction and interest rate reduction and the implementation of land reform are completely just. The peasants work hard all year round but cannot get enough to eat and stay warm. This unreasonable situation has long needed reform." Taking his family's leased land and rent collection as an example, he refuted some stubborn arguments that peasants rely on landlords for a living, saying: "My family's five-odd hectares of land were originally bought for two silver dollars per mu. Now that we have collected rent for so many years, we have already eaten dozens of times the money for the land. Moreover, this land originally belonged to the peasants. Isn't this the landlord relying on the peasants for food?" Yin also voluntarily requested to participate in the work of the Luan River government and often cooperated with other cadres to go to the countryside to promote the policies and decrees of rent reduction and interest rate reduction. On the 8th of last month, Yin asked for leave to go home and discussed the matter of returning the rent with his father. After determined persuasion, he obtained the consent of the whole family and personally went to Yin's manor in Shidongzui, Maquanzi, and other areas of the Fifth District, summoning a meeting of tenant farmers to return all the leased land to the peasants without compensation. He burned the old contracts on the spot and wrote new contracts. To take care of Yin's large family (a total of sixteen people), the tenant farmers and the county government, after consultation, allocated another seventy mu of land for Yin's family to cultivate themselves. Now Yin's family has joined the labor force. Yin Shuzong's old father happily told people: "We are no longer shameful parasites. We feel at ease supporting ourselves with our own hands."

　　滦河地主尹树宗
    自动将挂地退还农民
    【新华社承德二十四日电】滦河二区地主尹树宗，感于共产党土地政策之合乎法理人情，目前自动将五百亩挂地全部退与农民。尹先生中学肄业时代，曾受科学民主思想薰染；平素对乡里豪绅恶霸苛压农民的不法行为，即抱反感。去秋滦河解放后，彼即遍购毛主席各种著作潜心研究，并常语乡里友好：“共产党组织减租减息与实行土地改革主张完全是正义的，农民辛苦终年不得饱暖，这种不合理情形，早就需要改革了”，并以他家挂地收租情形为例，驳斥某些农民靠地主生活的顽固论调说：“我家五顷多地，是当初以一亩两块银洋置的，到如今吃了这多年租子，早就吃过了挂地钱几十倍，而且这些地原来就是属于农民的，这不是地主靠农民吃饭是什么？”尹并自动要求参加滦河政府工作，常协同其他干部下乡推行减租减息政策法令。上月八日尹请假回家，与其父商量退租事，经决心说服，当获全家同意，并亲赴五区石洞咀、马圈子等尹家庄园，召集佃户大会，将所有挂地无代价退还农民。当场焚毁旧契，重新写新契。佃户及县府为照顾尹家人口众多（共十六口人），经商洽另拨七十亩地给尹家自种。现尹家已参加劳动，尹树宗老父愉快的告人说：“咱再不是耻辱的寄生虫了，靠自己双手养活自己良心就安了。”
