　　[Report from our newspaper in Yangcheng] In Meng County, unlawful landlords manipulated the appraisal committees during the summer grain collection, creating injustice, shifting the burden, and attacking the emancipated masses, which aroused mass struggle. In Zichang Village, Third District, the newly emancipated chairman of the Farmers' Association, who obtained only 1.5 mu of land and one donkey in the struggle, was assessed a burden of 1.4 dan of grain, while the landlord Niu Yongzheng was assessed only 4 dou. The chairman of the Farmers' Association and the director of the Armed Committee in Yusi Village, both newly emancipated poor peasants, were classified as first-class households, with a grain burden of 800 jin, exceeding that of the landlords in the village by more than ten times. The landlords used this to create terror among the masses, suppress the enthusiasm for emancipation and struggle, and prevent them from advancing towards the path of prosperity. The occurrence of these problems is mainly due to the fact that the transformation of the government was not combined with mass movements, and the transformation was not thorough. In addition, the simple task-oriented view in the burden work allowed landlords to take advantage of loopholes. After the problem was discovered, cadres and the masses throughout the district decided to launch a struggle against injustice, combined with rent reduction and debt liquidation, to deepen the mass movement. Currently, villages such as Wang Dayi have entered this struggle, dismissing the appraisers manipulated by the landlords, clearing out more than 100 mu of land concealed by three landlord families, and re-conducting a reasonable appraisal to repel the landlords' counter-offensive conspiracy.
    [Report from our newspaper in Yangcheng] After the liberation of Jiang County, the democratic government, seeing that the people of Chengguan were extremely impoverished due to the oppression and exploitation by bandit Chen Ziwen, decided to exempt the people of Chengguan District from burdens for one year and allocate 17,000 jin of grain for relief.
    [Report from our newspaper in Heze] After the mass movement and the transformation of the village government in Xinzhuang, Fourth District of Hua County, the phenomena of corruption and waste began to be eliminated, and village expenditures were greatly reduced. When the feudal reactionary representative Shu De served as village chief, each mu of land had to pay more than 23 yuan in village funds per month, most of which was embezzled and wasted by those in power. After Shu De was dismissed during the mass movement last year, the newly elected peasant village chief Guo Fengjie immediately sought ways to save village expenses in order to reduce the burden on the masses. After the accounts were settled at the beginning of May, the village funds amounted to only six yuan per mu per month, and the masses felt that "it was like spending no money at all." Some people said with emotion: "After all, it is the village chief we elected ourselves, who knows the difficulties of us suffering people and has saved us so much money!" The village chief received enthusiastic support from the masses, and his enthusiasm was even higher. He is now discussing more specific methods with other village cadres to continue to reduce village expenses.

　　孟县不法地主转嫁负担
    群众展开反不公斗争       
    绛县城关区豁免负担一年滑县新庄肃清贪污浪费
    【本报阳城讯】孟县不法地主在夏粮征收中，操纵评议会，制造不公，转嫁负担，打击翻身群众，激起群众斗争。三区子昌村，刚翻身的农会主席，在斗争中仅得到亩半地，一头毛驴，就给他算出负担一石四斗，相反的地主牛永正却只算了四斗。禹寺村农会主席和武委会主任，都是新由贫农翻身，则被列入头等户，他们负担粮竟达八百斤，超过本村地主十数倍。地主借此造成群众恐怖思想，打击翻身斗争热情，不敢向发家致富的途径前进。这种问题的发生，多系改造政权没有与群运结合，改造不彻底，又加负担工作中的单纯任务观点，致使地主有机可乘。问题发现后，全区干部群众即决定开展反不公斗争，结合减租清债，求得群运更加深入。现王大义等村，已进入这一斗争，罢免了地主玩弄的评议员，清算出三家地主隐瞒的土地百余亩，重新进行合理评议，打退地主反攻阴谋。
    【本报阳城讯】绛县解放后，民主政府见城关老百姓，被陈匪子文压榨剥削，生活极为困难。特决定豁免城关区人民负担一年，并拨粮一万七千斤，进行救济。
    【本报荷泽讯】滑县四区西新庄经过群运，改造村政权以后，贪污浪费现象开始肃清，村款开支大大减少。该村在封建反动代表书德当村长时，每月每亩地光村款要摊二十三元多，绝大部分被当权者们贪污浪费了。去年群运中罢免了书德后，新选的农民村长郭凤阶为减轻群众负担，即从各方面想办法，节省村里费用。到五月头上结了一次账，每月每亩地仅摊村款六元，群众都觉得“就和没花钱一样。”有些人感慨的说：“到底是咱自己选的村长，知道咱受苦人的难处，给咱省了这样多钱！”村长受到群众的热烈拥护，情绪更加高涨。现正与其他村干部共同讨论更多具体办法来继续减少村里开支。
