    【Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 9th】The Dongjiang Column, with 2,500 soldiers led by Commander Zeng Sheng, Deputy Commander Wang Zuoyao, and Director of the Political Department Yang Tinghua, which withdrew north to strive for national peace and democracy, arrived in Yantai at 7:00 AM on the 5th aboard three American landing ships. Cao Manzhi, Director of the Jiaodong Liberated Area Administrative Office, Wang Du, Deputy Commander of the Military Region, Liu Yong, Commander of the 6th Division, Zhong Xidong, Political Commissar, Xu Zhongfu, Acting Deputy Mayor of Yantai City, Wang Mingyuan, Chief of the Liaison Section of the Military Region, and reporters from Xinhua News Agency, along with dozens of others, personally went to Langba Wharf to welcome them. Tens of thousands of people throughout the city emptied their houses, bringing food and drink, and lined up to swarm the wharf to greet them. As Commander Zeng led his troops ashore, military music and firecrackers sounded in unison, cheers thundered, and the masses showered them with flowers, stuffing comfort items into the soldiers' pockets. Although the Dongjiang Column soldiers and commanders had traveled far across the ocean, they were all full of spirit, heroic, and amiable. At the temporary welcoming venue in front of Langba Gate, Deputy Commander Wang of the Military Region, Director Cao, and Political Commissar Zhong delivered speeches successively, expressing their warm welcome and condolences to the comrades of the Dongjiang Column, who were famous at home and abroad for their arduous and extraordinary perseverance in fighting the enemy behind enemy lines in Guangdong for eight years during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and who had now made concessions and withdrawn north for the sake of national peace. Finally, Commander Zeng spoke, first expressing his gratitude on behalf of all the comrades of the Dongjiang Column. He then stated: This time, in order to implement the central government of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of peace, we are enduring and putting the nation first, leaving our hometown and relinquishing the liberated area built with blood and flesh during eight years of hard fighting, and coming to Yantai. From now on, we pledge to work together with everyone to fight to the end for the independence, peace, and democracy of our motherland. Amidst the enthusiastic cheers of the masses, the comrades of the Dongjiang Column were treated to lodging at the camp.
