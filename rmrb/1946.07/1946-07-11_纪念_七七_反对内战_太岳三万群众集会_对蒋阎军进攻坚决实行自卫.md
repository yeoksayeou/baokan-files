　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Yangcheng, dated the 7th] The Taiyue Region, in order to solemnly commemorate the first "July 7th" anniversary after the victory of the patriotic war, held a mass rally of 30,000 people at the Yangcheng Martyrs' Cemetery at 3:00 PM today. At the beginning of the rally, several thousand members of the Yangcheng militia combat team, carrying rifles and machine guns seized from the enemy, puppet, and stubborn elements, as well as their own-made landmines and stone mines, passed the rostrum in high spirits in three columns. The entire presidium stood up to salute and welcome them, and the whole audience applauded thunderously for twenty-five minutes. During the meeting, Mr. Gao Yanliu, a responsible person of the Henan Democratic National Construction Association and an old educator from Henan, said: "The eight years of arduous patriotic war were to defeat the Japanese invaders and make the country independent, but today new traitors have emerged who, with the direct help of American imperialist elements, have launched a civil war. Until today, the situation has become increasingly critical. The Kuomintang reactionaries, from the Northeast to North China, have ignited the flames of civil war everywhere. The Chiang-Yan armies have begun to attack our Southern Shanxi Liberated Area. We must oppose civil war and carry out self-defense, and vow to fight for national independence, peace, and democracy. The CCP's "July 7th" Ninth Anniversary Declaration points out this path, the path to striving for independence, peace, and democracy. We wholeheartedly support the four urgent appeals in the CCP declaration. "Shangguan Zhongyou, a labor hero from Yanshan Village, said: "We have just turned over after rent reduction and debt liquidation. The Kuomintang reactionaries want to suppress us again. In order to thoroughly turn over, to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries from fighting a civil war, we must produce well. This is the capital for winning battles." Li Tujin, the explosion king of the Yangcheng militia, and Ye Mingzhen, a militia hero, both spoke, explaining that the people have the strength to defend themselves, and called on the militia to implement the combination of labor and military affairs, implement rent reduction, production, learn combat skills, and the patriotic war can definitely achieve victory. At the end of the meeting, the assembly passed a telegram to Chairman Mao in Yan'an supporting the "July 7th" Declaration, a telegram of condolences to Mr. Ma Xulun and other gentlemen who were beaten by Kuomintang agents in Nanjing, and a telegram to compatriots across the country opposing the civil war before adjourning.
