Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th—The Central News Agency, in a dispatch from Beiping on the 18th, claimed: "Liu Shanben, a member of the Air Force Eighth Brigade, flew a 'B24' aircraft north on official business on June 26th. Unexpectedly, he lost his way due to severe weather en route and flew over northern Shaanxi. The area was mountainous, making landing impossible, and with gasoline running out, he was finally forced to land at the Yan'an airport..." A reporter interviewed Captain Liu regarding this matter. Mr. Liu stated: "On June 26th, I was ordered by the Aviation Commission to take off from Xinjin Airport in Chengdu and fly to Kunming. Seven 'B24' aircraft took off on the same day. My colleagues and I were determined to withdraw from the civil war and had made preparations beforehand, which is completely different from what the Central News Agency called 'flying north on official business.' After landing at Yan'an Airport, the aircraft still had 1,100 gallons of gasoline, enough for five more hours of flight. The Central News Agency's claim of 'gasoline running out' only reveals the clumsy trickery of the reporter fabricating stories behind closed doors. Furthermore, the claim of 'losing direction' is obviously nonsense. Even as the Central News Agency said, the 'B24' aircraft No. 530, flying north, was equipped with radio and compass and could certainly recognize and fly to airports in Beiping or Xi'an. Are there fewer Kuomintang airports than airports in the Communist areas?" Mr. Liu laughed and said: "The Central News Agency reporter's ability to fabricate rumors is too poor. After I withdrew from the civil war, they delayed until today to issue such an absurd and laughable telegram, which precisely exposes how distressed they are in their desperate attempt to cover up the civil war policy that the Kuomintang authorities are adhering to today!"

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st—Since Liu Shanben and others, who flew to Yan'an to withdraw from the civil war vortex, arrived here, people from all walks of life have come to express their sympathy. Captain Liu and others sent a letter to the Liberation Daily on the 18th to thank all circles, stating: "Now the darkness and corruption in the Kuomintang areas have reached their peak. Warlords, bureaucrats, and compradores engage in corruption and bribery, causing widespread suffering and destitution. Moreover, the Chinese fascists are using Hitler's mantle, concentration camps and secret police fill the country, and special agents commit murder and harm everywhere, even at the expense of selling out national interests and using foreign forces to slaughter their own compatriots, something even the Northern Warlords did not do. But the great wave of the entire Chinese people demanding independence, democracy, and peace cannot be stopped. We are willing to follow the examples of all the advanced elements and fight to the end to eliminate the remnants of fascism and build a bright paradise—a peaceful and democratic New China!"

　　中央社无耻造谣刘善本据实揭露
    【新华社延安二十日电】据中央社北平十八日电称：“空军第八大队队员刘善本于六月二十六日亲驾‘Ｂ２４’型机因公北飞，不意于途中因气候恶劣迷失方向，飞临陕北一带，附近多山，无从降落，加以汽油告罄，不得已终于被迫误落于延安机场…………。”记者特为此事走访刘上尉，刘氏称：“六月二十六日，我奉航空委员会命，由成都新津机场起飞，驾赴昆明，同日起飞者有‘Ｂ２４’式机七架。本机同人等决心退出内战，事前系有准备，大非如中央社所谓‘因公北飞’。在降落延安机场后，本机尚存汽油一千一百加仑，足供继续飞行五小时之用，中央社所谓‘汽油告罄’只能显示出该记者闭门造车之笨拙技俩。继谓：‘迷失方向’显系胡说，即使如中央社所说，在北飞途中‘Ｂ２４’式５３０号机上亦装设有无线电与罗盘，当可认向飞赴北平或西安等地机场降落，难道国民党的机场会比共产党地区的机场少吗”？刘氏笑称：“中央社记者捏造谣言的本领太不高明了，他们在我退出内战后，迟迟到今天才发出这样一个荒谬可笑的电讯，恰恰暴露了他们为了掩饰国民党当局今天所坚持的内战政策，是如何心劳日拙的窘相！”
    【新华社延安二十一日电】退出内战漩涡驾机飞延之刘善本等来此后，此间各界纷纷前往慰问，刘上尉等于十八日特致文解放日报转致各界答谢，内称：“现在国民党区域的黑暗腐败已登峰造极，军阀官僚买办贪污舞弊，弄得民不聊生，哀鸿遍野，且中国法西斯派沿用希魔衣钵，集中营密秘警察布满国内，特务明杀暗害到处行凶，甚至不惜出卖国家民族利益，借外力屠杀自己同胞，为北洋军阀所不及，但全中国人民要求独立民主和平的巨浪是阻挡不住的，我们愿追随诸先进之后，为扫除法西斯余孽，建设一个光明的乐园——和平民主的新中国而奋斗到底！”
