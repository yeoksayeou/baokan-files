Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 17th—Yesterday was the second day of the Harbin Temporary Council. Mayor Liu Chengdong reported on 73 days of municipal work: (1) Municipal construction: Although Harbin is located on the front line of the war, 112 construction projects of various sizes have been completed or are underway in 73 days, of which the repair of underground sewers alone cost more than 2.5 million yuan. (2) Medical and health construction. (3) Education. A textbook editorial committee, teacher training classes, and student tutoring classes were organized. (4) Finance and taxation. The democratic government abolished various exorbitant taxes and levies such as rickshaws and pedicabs, and abolished the 5% ad valorem tax method and implemented a progressive tax system. In addition, the municipal government has directly distributed all public land in the city to villagers with little or no land for cultivation, and 411 households have officially registered and received deeds. (5) Urban transportation. Six trams are now in operation, five buses are in service, and transportation on the Songhua River is smooth. (6) Restoration of industry and commerce. In addition to holding symposiums for industry and commerce to find ways to solve their difficulties, it is also planning to lease enemy-owned factories to industrialists and businessmen at low prices.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th—On the third day of the Harbin Temporary Council, Mayor Liu Chengdong answered the questions of the councilors regarding the work report. Mayor Liu replied: (1) To build a prosperous country, the land problem of farmers must be solved. We must distribute all enemy and puppet land to the farmers. Farmers in remote areas have already received enemy and puppet land, and distribution has also begun in the suburbs. (2) Regarding the property of enemy and puppet households, the municipal government is preparing to hand it over to the people for repair and residence, and will not collect rent for a certain period. (3) The municipal government’s management policy for Japanese expatriates is to thoroughly eliminate fascist ideas, arrest war criminals, and gradually concentrate them in the suburbs of the city, and will soon send them back to their country. The remaining houses will be given to citizens to live in. (4) Regarding house donations, those with a monthly income of less than 1,000 yuan are exempt from tax. (5) Harbin's tap water system has been in disrepair for many years. The government has now organized a tap water restoration committee to restore it quickly.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 20th—The policy program for the democratic construction of 800,000 people in Harbin has been unanimously approved on the fourth day of the Temporary Council after heated debate. The draft policy program was proposed by 12 councilors including Zhong Ziyun and Xie Yuqin, and explained by Councilor Yang Wei. The policy program politically determined to establish an elected government and a democratic rule of law social order through universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot, to protect human rights and property rights; to protect freedoms of assembly, association, publication, speech, and belief; and to protect the people’s right to accuse traitors and secret agents. Economically, it develops and restores industry and commerce, solves the livelihood of poor workers and shop assistants, and promotes labor-capital cooperation. Regarding the land issue, Councilor Yang said: "If we want to develop industry and commerce, we must implement 'land to the tiller'. Therefore, we propose to distribute enemy and puppet land and municipal land to farmers with little or no land for cultivation." Councilor Du Guangyu spoke, expressing his agreement with Councilor Yang's opinion. Councilor Jin Yuyu expressed his opinion on the distribution of enemy and puppet land, believing that confiscated land should be owned by the city, and farmers should pay rent for cultivating the land. Councilor Sun Shikun stood up and agreed, while farmer councilor Li Guangfu supported the original proposal, saying: "The land distributed to farmers today was seized by enemies and puppets in the past, and it should definitely be distributed to farmers without compensation." Councilor Meng Shu also said: "'Land to the tiller' is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition." Farmer representative He Weiyu used his personal painful experience to illustrate that poor farmers should be given enemy and puppet land. Another farmer representative, Wang Xin, hoped that after the confiscated enemy and puppet land is distributed to farmers, land licenses will be issued immediately. After a long discussion, the conference finally voted down the proposal that the land be owned by the city and not distributed to farmers. In addition to preserving Councilor Yang's original proposal, it also added a clause to "take care of landholders whose land has been occupied by the enemy and are poor". After heated discussion and amendments, Harbin's policy program was unanimously approved by all councilors.

　　哈尔滨临参会
    热烈检查市政工作一致通过施政纲领
    【新华社哈尔滨十七日电】昨日为哈市临参会第二日，刘成栋市长报告七十三天市政工作：（一）市政建设，哈市虽处战争前线，七十三天中，已完成和正在进行的大小工程建设，计有一百一十二件，其中仅地下水道的修复，即开支二百五十万元以上。（二）医药卫生建设。（三）教育事业。曾组织教科书编审委员会，教师讲习会，师生补习班等。（四）财政税收。民主政府废除人力车、三轮车等各种苛捐杂税，废除值百抽五办法而实行累进税制。此外市府已将全市公有土地，直接分与少地或无地乡民耕种，正式登记领契者，已达四百一十一户。（五）市内交通。现已有六台电车出动，公共汽车已通行五辆，松花江运输已畅通。（六）恢复工商业。除召开工商业座谈会设法解决其困难外，并正计划将敌产工厂低价租与工商业家经营。
    【新华社哈尔滨二十日电】哈市临参会第三日，刘成栋市长答复各参议员关于市工作报告中的质问。刘市长答话：（一）欲建立一个繁荣的国家，必须解决农民土地问题，我们必须将一切敌伪土地分给农民。现在远处农民已经分到敌伪土地，近郊也已开始分配。（二）敌伪户产问题，市府正准备交给人民修补居住，在一定时期内不收房租。（三）市府对日侨管理方针，是彻底肃清法西斯思想，逮捕战争罪犯，并逐渐将其集中市郊，不久即当遣送回国，其剩下房屋，让与市民居住。（四）房捐问题，以每月收入一千元以下者免税。（五）哈市自来水道年久失修，政府现已组织自来水复兴委员会，迅速恢复。
    【新华社哈尔滨二十日电】哈尔滨市八十万人民民主建设的施政纲领，经过热烈争辩后，已在临参会第四日一致通过。施政纲领草案，是由钟子云谢雨琴等十二位参议员提出，由杨维参议员解释，施政纲领在政治上确定由普遍平等直接与不记名投票，建立民选政府与民主的法治的社会秩序，保障人权、财权；保障集会、结社、出版、言论、信仰等自由；保障人民对汉奸特务控诉权。在经济上发展恢复工商业，解决贫苦工人店员的生活，提倡劳资合作。关于土地问题，杨参议员说：“如果要发展工商业，必须实行‘耕者有其田’，因此我们提议将敌伪土地及市有土地，分配给无地及少地农民耕种。”杜光宇参议员发言，对杨议员意见表示赞同。金玉予参议员对分配敌伪土地问题发表意见，他认为应将没收之土地收归市有，农民耕地则交租。孙世琨参议员起立赞同，农民参议员李光复则赞成原提议，他说：“今天农民所分配的土地，是敌伪过去霸占去的，绝对应该无代价的分给农民”。孟述参议员也说：“‘耕者有其田’是乃是中山先生的主张。”农民代表和威宇，则以他亲身经历的痛苦，来说明贫苦农民应该分得敌伪土地。另一农民代表王信，希望没收敌伪土地发给农民后，立即发给土地执照。大会经过长时间的讨论，最后经过表决，否决了土地市有而不分给农民的提案。除保存杨议员原案外，并增加“照顾土地被敌霸占而且贫苦的地户”一条，经过热烈讨论与修正补充后，哈市施政纲领获得全体参议员一致通过。
