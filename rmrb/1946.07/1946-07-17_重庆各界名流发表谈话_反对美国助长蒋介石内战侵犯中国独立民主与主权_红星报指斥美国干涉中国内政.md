Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Chongqing sources report: Prominent figures from all walks of life here recently gave statements to our agency's reporters, opposing the United States' aid to the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorial government, which directly fuels China's civil war and infringes upon China's independence, democracy, and complete sovereignty. Social scientist Deng Chumin cited historical examples of American imperialism's aggression against China, saying: "During the Eight-Nation Alliance's invasion of Beijing, the United States also lent money to the Northern Warlords to massacre the Chinese people. During the September 18th Incident, the United States even colluded with Japan, and after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the U.S. still aided Japan with steel. It wasn't until the Pearl Harbor incident when they themselves suffered losses that they changed their attitude. Today, the facts prove that the United States is a promoter of China's civil war. This kind of imperialist policy not only wants to push China towards death but also leads the American people onto the wrong path." Huang Zenghan, manager of Juxingcheng Bank, stated: "The Kuomintang government's current economic policy is a 'national economic suicide policy'. If it continues, within a year, the whole country will be flooded with American goods, and not only will industry and commerce go bankrupt, but agriculture will also go bankrupt." Economist Jiang Qingxiang said: "The dumping of American goods is a fatal blow to China's national industry, posing a danger of China becoming a colony." Jiang expressed extreme indignation at the four ports open to trade, the U.S. Navy's occupation of Chinese territorial waters, and MacArthur's announcement that Japan could fish in Chinese coastal waters. Renowned lawyer Shi Liang believes: "At a time when the Chinese people are demanding a ceasefire, the United States is implementing the so-called Military Aid to China Act, which is a violation of the Chinese people's will, supporting the Kuomintang's civil war and dictatorial policy, and making it impossible for China to embark on the road to democracy and independence." Economist Xu Tingying solemnly pointed out: "The government is using fiscal revenue as funding for the civil war and has promulgated new company laws and foreign exchange measures, which have encouraged the influx of foreign goods, dealing a major blow to national industry and foreign trade, causing a total collapse of national industry, and making the country follow in the footsteps of the Philippines." Industrialist Zhou Zongqiong sternly pointed out: "America's military aid to China" is actually "military aggression against China." He said with emotion: "If this continues, we 'industrialists' will all become 'unemployed people'!"

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Moscow dispatch: The Red Star newspaper's international observer denounced U.S. military aid to China as interference in China's internal affairs. The observer stated: Chinese progressive figures are expressing growing alarm over the national crisis growing in their country. The Chinese people made enormous sacrifices in the War of Resistance against Japan for the sake of independence, peace, and democracy, but they have not obtained the peace they longed for, nor the opportunity to establish their lives on a democratic foundation. Reactionary elements within the Kuomintang are provoking armed conflicts with the People's Revolutionary Army and have become an obstacle to the path of national unity. At the same time, the Chinese people are gradually realizing that one of the main reasons for the serious situation in China is the increasing military aid given by the United States to the Kuomintang. Chinese progressive public organizations are demanding an immediate halt to U.S. military aid to the Kuomintang and regard it as interference in China's internal affairs. Meetings and demonstrations held in many cities and provinces effectively illustrate that the Chinese people will continue to fight against the conspiracies of the reactionaries, regardless of their camouflage, in order to defend the country's independence. Social groups in Chahar, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces, representing 40 million people, sent a telegram to the whole country, advising the United States not to interfere in China's internal affairs. On the ninth anniversary of the Anti-Japanese War, mass rallies were held throughout China to commemorate the event. The CCP issued a declaration, advocating an immediate end to all local civil wars and the resolution of all problems through the democratic reorganization of China. Many meetings held to commemorate the countless victims of the War of Resistance against Japan urged the entire Chinese people to loudly oppose civil war and Kuomintang dictatorship.

　　重庆各界名流发表谈话
    反对美国助长蒋介石内战侵犯中国独立民主与主权
    红星报指斥美国干涉中国内政
    【新华社延安十四日电】渝讯：此间各界名流顷对本社记者发表谈话，反对美国援助蒋介石独裁政府，直接助长中国内战，侵犯中国独立民主与主权完整。社会科学家邓初民氏从历史上举出美帝国主义的对华侵犯称：“在八国联军进攻北京的时代，美国也曾借钱给北洋军阀来屠杀中国人民，九一八事变时，美国与日本还拉拉扯扯，而抗战爆发后，美还以钢铁援助日本。直至珍珠港事件自己吃了亏，才改变态度。今天事实证明美国是中国内战助长者，此种帝国主义政策，不仅想把中国推进死亡中，且将美国人民引入错误的道路。聚兴诚银行经理黄增涵氏称：“现在国民党政府经济政策，就是‘经济亡国政策’，如继续下去，不上一年，全国都会充满美货，不但工商业要破产，而且农业也要破产”。经济学家姜庆湘氏说：“美货倾销，对中国民族工业是一个致命的打击，有使中国沦为殖民地危险”。姜氏对四口通商，美海军占领中国领海及麦克阿瑟宣布日本在中国沿海捕鱼等，表示极为愤慨。名律师史良氏认为：“美国在中国人民要求停战之际，实行所谓军事援华法案，实为违背中国人民意志，支持国民党内战独裁政策，使中国永不能走上民主独立大道”。经济学家许廷映氏沉痛指出：“政府将财政收入作为内战经费，并颁布新公司法、外汇办法等，已鼓励外货内流，予民族工业及对外贸易以重大打击，使民族工业总崩溃，使国家步入菲律宾之后尘”。实业家周宗琼氏严正指出：“美国的军事援华”，实为“军事侵华”。他感慨的说：“这样下去，我们‘实业家’就都变为‘失业家’了”！
    【新华社延安十四日电】莫斯科讯：红星报国际观察家指斥美国军事援华，干涉中国内政。观察家称：中国进步人士对于该国滋长的民族危机，表示与时俱进的恐慌。中国人民为了独立、和平与民主，在抗日战争中蒙受了极大的牺牲，但并没有得到望眼欲穿的和平，及在民主基础上奠定生活的机会。国民党内反动分子正向人民革命军挑起武装冲突，并已变成走向国家统一道路上的障碍。同时，中国人民逐渐洞悉造成中国时局严重的主要原因之一，乃是美国给予国民党的愈来愈多的军事援助。中国进步之公共团体，要求立即停止美国对国民党之军事援助，并视之为干涉中国内政。在许多城市及各省中举行的集会和示威，有效的说明了中国人民为了保卫国家的独立，将继续向反动派之阴谋作斗争，不管反动派的保护色如何。察哈尔、山东、陕西诸省之社会团体，代表四千万人民致电全国，劝告美国不要干涉中国内政。抗战九周年纪念日，中国各地群众集会纪念，中共发表宣言，主张立即停止一切地方之内战，并通过中国之民主改组来调解一切问题。为纪念抗日战争中无数牺牲者而召开的许多会议，参加者敦促整个中国人民大声疾呼，反对内战和国民党独裁。
