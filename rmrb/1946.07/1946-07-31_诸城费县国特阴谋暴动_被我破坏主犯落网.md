　　Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 23rd—The Zhucheng County Public Security Bureau of Shandong Province cracked a case on the 20th of last month in which Nationalist spies conspired to riot in coordination with Chiang's troops scheduled to land along the coast, in an attempt to seize the northeastern part of the Binhai Liberated Area. All the principal and accessory offenders have been arrested. According to the evidence obtained and the confessions of the criminals, as early as last September when the Eighth Route Army liberated Zhucheng, Zhang Jutian, the Nationalist spy chief of Zhucheng County, sent Han traitors Zhang Kegong (the private secretary of Zhang Buyun's Japanese advisor in the puppet army) and Tian Dongyou to sneak into Zhucheng, Ju County, and Rizhao County to establish three offices, organize assassination squads, and conduct espionage activities. According to Zhang Kegong, the chief spy, in April this year, he received a secret order from the Nationalist spy agency in Qingdao to unify forces and prepare for a riot as an internal response when Chiang's troops attacked. The three offices were reorganized into the Zhucheng County Government (located in Gaomi City), and the assassination squad was changed to the Armed Self-Defense Regiment. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, the leaders of the major detachments were summoned to Gaomi for a meeting, at which it was revealed that a certain unit of the Nationalist 8th Army would cooperate with the Chiang-puppet troops in Jiaoxian and Gaomi to attack the Binhai Liberated Area. To conspire for coordinated action from within and without, the spy armed forces were ordered to rapidly expand and develop, awaiting orders to launch a riot. It was specifically stipulated that Sun Youming and Zhao Hongshun, the spies of the Fourth Detachment in the Renli District of Zhucheng County, assassinate the responsible persons of the Renli District Government in the Liberated Area in mid-June and seize the weapons of the district self-defense squadron. However, just as the Eighth Route Army, at the request of the people, launched a punitive self-defense war against the traitors, Jiaoxian and Gaomi were successively liberated on June 9th and 13th, causing the original plan to fail, and all the criminals were brought to justice.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 25th—The Feixian City Public Security Bureau and local armed forces and militia in Lunan suppressed an armed riot by Nationalist spies on June 1st, and all the offenders have been captured. As early as January this year, Nationalist spy chiefs Chen Baoshan (former commander of the puppet pacification army) and Zhang Chuanyin and others sneaked into Feixian County to organize spy agencies and establish assassination squads. According to Zhang Chuanyin, the chief spy, they were ordered by their superiors to carry out an armed riot and decided to attack Feixian City. They specifically planned to have spies lurking in the city as internal support, preparing to close the city gates and hold fast after entering the city, waiting for Nationalist air transport for supplies and then expanding outwards.

    【新华社临沂二十三日电】山东诸城县公安局，于上月二十日破获国民党特务图谋配合预定在沿海登陆之蒋军举行暴动，以侵占滨海解放区东北部地区之阴谋案件，所有主从犯已全部落网。根据所获证件及人犯口供证明，远在八路军于去年九月解放诸城后，国民党诸城县特务头子张居田，即派汉奸张克功（伪军张步云日本顾问之私人秘书）、田东友等潜入诸城、莒县及日照等县，成立三个办事处，组织暗杀团，进行特务活动。据特务首脑张克功供称，今年四月间，奉青岛国民党特务机关密令，为统一力量准备暴动以作为蒋军进攻时之内应，将三个办事处改组为诸城县县政府（设于高密城内），将暗杀团改为武装自卫团。端午节前召集各大队之首领至高密开会，会上透露国民党第八军某部将配合胶县高密一带之蒋伪军进攻滨海解放区。为谋里应外合，复令特务武装迅速扩大发展，待命举行暴动。并具体规定活动于诸县仁里区的第四大队部特务孙有明、赵洪顺，于六月中旬暗杀解放区仁里区政府负责人，夺取区自卫中队的枪支。但适值八路军应人民之请，展开讨逆自卫战，于六月九日及十三日相继解放胶县、高密，致原计划破产，全部人犯均落法网。
    【新华社临沂二十五日电】鲁南费县城公安局及地方武装与民兵，于六月一日扑灭国民党特务的武装暴动，所有人犯已全部就擒。早在今年一月，国民党特务头子陈保善（曾任伪绥靖军团长）张传印等即潜入费县境内组织特务机关，成立暗杀团，据特务首脑张传印供称：他们奉上峰命令实行武装暴动，决定进攻费县城，并具体计划由潜伏在城内之特务为内应，准备在进城后，紧闭城门固守，以待国民党空运接济然后再向外扩展。
