　　Taihang Areas Urged to Pay Attention to Pest Control
　　[Report from our Changzhi office] Taihang is suffering from a lack of rain, and agricultural pests are spreading rapidly. Cotton fields in various areas are 70-80% affected by drought. Wuxiang County planted 100 hectares of cotton this year, and the county government has issued urgent instructions to organize the masses for rescue. Li, the head of the Construction Section, has personally taken sprayers to provide assistance and is rushing to produce a large number of homemade sprayers to be promoted throughout the county. Locust nymphs have been discovered in villages around Mofushan in Huixian County. The government has issued urgent instructions, ordering responsible cadres in each village to conduct locust situation reconnaissance and report on the situation in their respective areas at any time. Naxin Village and Shanyaotou Village are also actively catching locust nymphs and hairy caterpillars. Thirty-four women in Shanyaotou Village have caught more than 20,000 hairy caterpillars and more than 2,500 kilograms of locust nymphs. Many villages in the fourth district of Neiqiu have discovered black locusts. In Song Village, more than 1.3 hectares of beans, cotton, and hemp have been eaten in one day. The masses immediately organized to capture them, catching more than 100 kilograms in two days. Wu Village also caught more than 55 kilograms in one day. Locusts discovered in the Qingshui, Houma, and Yuan areas of Taiyue have recently spread to Nanbanqiao and Xiling areas. Bean seedlings have been severely eaten.
