　　Deal Resolutely with the Attackers!
    Various Places are Urgently Preparing for Self-Defense
    Militia are Cleaning Their Guns and Preparing Ammunition, Ready to Mobilize. Women are Hastily Making Shoes and Socks, Preparing Luggage.
    [Report from Changzhi by Our Newspaper] In order to smash the large-scale attack by the Kuomintang reactionaries against us, the people of Taihang are preparing to actively participate in self-defense operations. Sujiajing Village in Lingchuan put forward the slogan: "Intensively hoe seedlings and prepare for self-defense," and conducted in-depth propaganda among the masses, formulating a village-wide seedling hoeing plan. Women and old men said, "This is a big deal, we must hoe for the young people (referring to the militia) first, so that they can concentrate on participating in the war." The next day, the production committee, led by Wang Qihai, hoed for the militia and the families of soldiers resisting Japan for three days, completing the hoeing of the land for 19 militia families and 4 families of soldiers resisting Japan. The militia are now fully prepared and ready to mobilize. The masses in the Fourth District of Jingxing are busy preparing for participation in the war: 1. Use maximum effort to intensively hoe seedlings first, rush to sow seeds, and prepare dry food, shoes and socks for participating in the war. 2. Auxiliary labor is also organized into reception, condolence and other groups according to the needs of the war, combined with production. Men, women, children, and old men are interwoven into mutual aid groups to supplement the lack of labor. In Nancun and other villages in the First District of Licheng, group mergers are being implemented to solve the labor difficulties after the militia participate in the war. For example, the group of labor hero Zhao Hengxian has five militiamen, and the group of Cheng Cang has one militiaman and one self-defense team. The two groups merge and absorb some female labor to form a group. Even if the militia leave, they can still complete the seedling hoeing task. The Yaode Labor Allocation Team in Anziling Village, Ninth District of Wuxi, held a general meeting of all team members to review the work of participating in the war last year in preparation for participating in the war. Everyone pointed out that in the past, there was no work account for the entire village when participating in the war, which was unfair. Finally, everyone decided that the village office would uniformly issue work tickets to the families of the militia. Whoever works for the militia will receive work tickets, and the entire village will settle the accounts uniformly after the militia return from the war. The militiamen in various villages in Neiqiu all requested to go to the Yuan (Shi) Huo (Lu) area to support. Now the women are washing and sewing socks for the militia, preparing their luggage for departure.
    [Report from Handan by Our Newspaper] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan-Taihang militia are actively preparing for self-defense. The Military Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region issued a call to the militia of the entire region on "July 7th," calling for an emergency mobilization to clean their guns, prepare hand grenades, and organize their teams to prepare for guerrilla warfare to defend their hometowns. Once the Kuomintang reactionaries attack, they will cooperate with the regular army to fight, and be responsible for maintaining post-war security and order. The militiamen who graduated from the armed training class in the new district of Taihang Neiqiu are also preparing to crush the new offensive of the Kuomintang reactionaries in order to protect their own interests. They are actively carrying out the following in various villages: (1) Rectify the joint defense of the militia in various villages, put all weapons in the hands of the militia, prevent special agents from infiltrating the militia, and conduct strict household registration checks. (2) Carry out a blasting campaign to universally educate the militia and the masses to bury landmines. (3) Prepare to participate in the war immediately. The militia organize their housework, discuss the methods of participating in the war and mutual assistance in the rear, and implement shift work to overcome the phenomenon that the militia were not at ease on the front line last year because production was not done well due to participation in the war.
　　Demobilized Soldier Wang Xing Said:
    If the reactionaries attack, I will immediately take up arms again!
    [Report from Qinghua by Our Newspaper] Under the tense situation that the Kuomintang army is actively preparing to attack us in the north, the people of northern Henan have mobilized one after another. On the 5th of this month, the masses of Xiwangchu Village in Bo'ai held a village-wide mobilization meeting. Wang Xing, a soldier of the Eighth Route Army who had been demobilized from the front line, called on the masses of the entire village at the meeting: In order to defend our peaceful and free homeland, the entire village should quickly organize and prepare for self-defense at any time. Once the Kuomintang army attacks us, our demobilized soldiers will immediately take up arms again and go to the front line. Villagers! We should quickly do a good job in logistics and fully support the front line. If everyone works together with one heart, how can we not defeat the attacking Kuomintang army?
    [Report from Heze by Our Newspaper] The First and Second Factories of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Printing Bureau have now fully mobilized to work intensively to defeat the reactionaries' conspiracy of civil war and rush to print various anti-civil war propaganda materials. The comrades in the typesetting room completed 100,000 words of work in five days; the stereotyping room did as much work as possible, and automatically extended the working hours to twelve hours. In particular, comrades Zhao Shuchun, Zhao Ruming, Liang Wenban and others who print newspapers gave up their rest after printing the newspapers and used the gaps in the machines to print more than 100,000 copies of propaganda materials. They printed dozens of propaganda materials such as "Have to Firmly Defend," "Smash His Head," and "Mobilize to Smash the Reactionaries' Offensive" on schedule, ensuring the smooth progress of the anti-civil war propaganda and mobilization work.
    [Report from Xingtai by Our Newspaper] Just as the students of Peking University Medical College were about to complete their intensive studies, they recently saw news in the newspaper that the Kuomintang was launching a large-scale offensive against us in northern Henan. Therefore, every student was filled with resentment and began to prepare lightly. Once the Kuomintang reactionaries start to attack us, we will immediately go to the front line to take on the work of front-line rescue and rear treatment. The first batch of students from the college have now gone to the front line.
