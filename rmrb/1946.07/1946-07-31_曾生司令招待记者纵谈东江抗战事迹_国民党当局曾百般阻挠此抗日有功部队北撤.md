　　Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 27th. Commander Zeng Sheng of the East River Column, upon arriving in Yantai with his troops, specially hosted journalists at the Foreign Affairs Office to recount the northward withdrawal of the East River Column and its eight years of heroic resistance against Japan. Commander Zeng Sheng stated: "Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders and the ceasefire order, the Kuomintang authorities have mobilized five armies and more than a dozen county security regiments, and with the cooperation of aircraft and the navy, launched a large-scale siege, implementing the so-called 'uprooting policy.' Anyone who had participated in the East River Column or even sympathized with the East River Column was subject to being killed. Even after the representatives of the Three-Man Team arrived in Guangdong and established the agreement for the East River Column's northward withdrawal, the Kuomintang authorities continued their military offensives while threatening the masses to sign pledges, attempting to prove their claim that 'there was no East River Column.' When the East River Column was concentrated under the harsh conditions of the agreement, the Kuomintang authorities sent secret agents and gangsters along the way to impersonate and rob, plotting to undermine the political reputation of our army. However, our army has always resolutely implemented the CCP Central Committee's peaceful policy and the northward withdrawal agreement, and with the greatest tolerance, tried its best to avoid conflict, and on June 29th, after being counted by the execution team, boarded the ship and set sail north on the 30th. After five days at sea, this army, which the American soldiers on board considered lively, united, consistent from top to bottom, and strictly disciplined, arrived in the Yantai liberated area on July 5th, and was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life, which truly made us feel both grief and joy. In the future, we will unite with the military and civilians of the Shandong liberated area and fight to the end to realize the independence, peace, and democracy of the whole country." Commander Zeng then recounted the eight years of resistance against Japan by the East River Column: "When the Japanese invaders invaded Guangzhou in October of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Kuomintang army fled without a trace. The Red Army guerrillas, who had been scattered in the East River area in the past, united with local farmers, students, and Hong Kong workers to form the first anti-Japanese guerrilla force in Guangdong. In the 28th year (1939), they advanced to both sides of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and joined forces with a guerrilla force led by Wang Zuoyao of the Dongguan County Committee of the Communist Party in Bao'an and Dongguan. In the 30th year (1941), these two forces were officially reorganized into the East River People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Column, repelling the continuous 'sweeps' by the Japanese invaders. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, when the enemy attacked Hong Kong, the East River Column cooperated with the British army in the defense of Hong Kong, constantly attacking the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and advancing into Kowloon, attacking the enemy's rear. At that time, it was widely rumored in Hong Kong that the Chinese army had attacked Shenzhen, which referred to this force. After the fall of Hong Kong, the East River Column risked their lives to rescue Allied friends in distress, Kuomintang officials, fellow countrymen, and overseas Chinese businessmen, etc., whose merits were not only witnessed by the local people, but also praised by international friends. After the 32nd year (1943), the enemy invaders were extremely fearful of the East River Column's tenacious fighting and the growth of its strength, so they increased their garrison from two divisions to five divisions, repeatedly carrying out 'sweeps' and 'encirclements and suppressions.' The East River Column cooperated with the local people to persist in the base areas, while the main force advanced to the enemy's rear, launching sabotage warfare against the enemy's transportation lines, making the enemy and puppet's 'sweep' and 'pacification' plans bankrupt. During this period, the East River Column also took swift action and made every effort to rescue Allied comrades such as American pilots and Indian soldiers from the enemy's clutches. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the East River Column used all its strength to attack the enemy and puppets along the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, forcing the enemy and puppets to surrender, and successively captured important towns such as Bao'an, liberating hundreds of thousands of compatriots. In the eight years of resistance against Japan, the East River Column actively attacked the enemy and puppets behind enemy lines, establishing vast liberated areas such as the East River, Han River, Shi (Xing) Fo (Gang) Ying (De) Weng (Yuan), covering an area of ​​about 60,000 square kilometers, with a population of more than 4.5 million."

　　曾生司令招待记者纵谈东江抗战事迹
    国民党当局曾百般阻挠此抗日有功部队北撤
    【新华社烟台二十七日电】东江纵队曾生司令率部抵烟台，特假外事处办公室招待记者，叙述东江纵队北撤经过，及八年英勇抗战事迹。曾生司令称：“自日寇投降及停战令后，国民党当局竟调动五个军及十几个县的保安团，并在飞机及海军配合下，大举围攻，实行所谓‘拔根政策’。凡曾参加东江纵队甚至同情东江纵队的群众，均在被杀之列。而在三人小组代表抵粤成立东江纵队北撤协议后，国民党当局仍一面进行军事进攻，一面威胁群众具结，企图证明其所谓‘并无东江纵队存在’。当东江纵队在协议的苛刻条件下集中时，国民党当局又均沿途派特务流氓冒名抢劫，阴谋破坏我军政治声誉。但我军始终坚决执行中共中央的和平方针与北撤协议，以最大之容忍，极力避免冲突，于六月二十九日由执行小组点名登船，三十日启程北上。五天的海上生活，这一支被舰上美军认为是活泼团结、上下一致、纪律严明的军队，于七月五日到达了烟台解放区，备受各界同胞热烈欢迎，真使我们悲喜交集。今后当与山东解放区军民团结一致，为实现全国的独立和平民主而奋斗到底”。曾司令继述东江纵队八年抗战事迹：“当民国二十七年十月日寇侵陷广州时，国民党军队逃得无影无踪，过去散布于东江一带的红军游击队，即联合当地农民学生及香港工人，组成广东第一支抗日游击队。二十八年挺进至广九路两侧，又与宝安、东莞等地由共产党东莞县委王作尧所领导的一支游击队会合。三十年，这两支队伍正式合编为东江人民抗日游击纵队，击退日寇的连续“扫荡”。太平洋战争爆发后，敌人进攻香港，东江纵队即配合英军进行香港保卫战，不断出击广九路，并挺进九龙，袭击敌人后方。当时香港盛传中国军队曾攻入深圳，就是指的这个部队。香港沦陷后，东江纵队更出生入死，抢救被难的盟国友人，国民党军的官员以及同胞与侨商等，其功迹不仅为当地人民所目睹，且为国际友人交相称道。三十二年后，敌寇对东江纵队的顽强作战与力量的生长极为恐惧，乃将其守军由两个师增至五个师，反复地进行‘扫荡’与‘清剿’。东江纵队一面配合当地人民，坚持根据地；一面以主力挺进至敌后，向敌人交通线，展开破击战，使敌伪之‘扫荡’与‘清乡’计划均告破产。在此时期，东江纵队并以敏捷行动，尽一切努力，从敌人虎口中营救美国飞行员及印度士兵等盟国战友。日寇投降后，东江纵队以全力向粤汉沿线敌伪进击，迫使敌伪投降，先后攻克宝安等重要城镇，解放数十万同胞。在八年抗战中，东江纵队在敌后积极打击敌伪，建立了东江、韩江、始（兴）佛（冈）英（德）翁（源）等广大解放区，面积约六万余平方里，人口达四百五十万以上”。
