Several Leaders Frequently Urged to Strive to Serve the People
	Military and Political University Turn-Over Team Goes to the Countryside
	Peking University Students Organize Summer Farmer Turn-Over Corps
[Reported by this newspaper] The farmer turn-over team composed of over 500 faculty members and students from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Military and Political University, after half a month of study, arrived in Handan with an unprecedentedly high level of enthusiasm since the school's establishment. Among them were sick students who, despite doctors' recommendations against working, insisted on coming along, carrying their luggage and singing songs. The Military Region Political Department's Cultural Troupe specially organized an evening party on the 11th to welcome and send them off. On the 12th, leaders from the Military Region and the Border Region took time out of their busy schedules to talk with the team, encouraging everyone to serve the people and reminding them of issues to be aware of after going to the countryside. Chairman Yang, in his parting words, inspired everyone by highlighting the profound suffering of peasants over thousands of years and the glory and greatness of leading the peasant turn-over cause. He especially urged that after going to the countryside, they should be determined to approach the masses, integrate with them, and unite closely with local cadres. Deputy Political Commissar Zhang pointed out the great significance of mobilizing the masses from various aspects, including overcoming the current severe crisis and building the liberated areas. He believed that this trip to the countryside was the best learning opportunity. In the future, whether serving in the military, the government, or other departments, it would all be for the people, so it was essential to understand the people. Commander Liu used the historical fact that the 129th Division started with three and a half guns and developed into hundreds of thousands of people to illustrate that "as long as we wholeheartedly serve the people, we will surely be victorious." He strongly called on everyone: "We must help the peasants stand up! Stand up! Stand up! Take up arms to defend ourselves! Defend China!" He hoped to receive good news from the turn-over team soon, saying: "This good news is as important as the good news from the front-line self-defense war."
	After the leaders' enthusiastic encouragement and exhortation, the team's morale became even higher. Companies, groups, and individuals successively proposed competition conditions, and everyone was determined to be a model turn-over team member and strive for a model group and a model company. On the 13th, they departed for Shahe, Gaoyi, Neihuang, Handan, Linzhang and other counties to begin their work. (Hanfeng, Zhan Chao, Liyun)

	Also, it is reported: Peking University decided to suspend classes and not have a vacation during the summer, calling on students to participate in mass movements and organizing groups to go to the countryside to help the masses turn over. Students remaining on campus will attend summer lectures to catch up on their studies. Examinations were held on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of this month, and mass movement learning began on the 10th. Around the 24th, they will go to Shahe, Xingtai, and other counties to help the masses turn over. The students of the university's School of Administration are particularly enthusiastic about helping the masses turn over and are actively participating. (Hanqing)

　　诸首长频频叮嘱勉为人民服务
    军政大学翻身队下乡
    北大同学组织暑期农民翻身团
    【本报讯】晋冀鲁豫边区军政大学教职学员五百余人组成的农民翻身队，经半月学习后，以创校以来所仅见的高度热情到达邯郸。其中有医生认为无论如何不应工作的带病同学，都背着行李唱着歌曲、坚决随来。军区政治部文工团特于十一日晚组织晚会欢迎并欢送他们。十二日，军区、边区各首长在百忙中抽空与该队谈话，鼓舞大家为人民服务，叮嘱下乡后应注意的问题。杨主席在他的临别赠言中，以农民几千年来所受的深重痛苦与领导农民翻身事业的光荣伟大来激励大家，并特别叮嘱下乡后要决心接近群众，与群众打成一片，与地方干部亲密团结。张副政委从克服目前时局严重危机与建设解放区等各方面指出发动群众的重大意义，并认为这次下乡工作是一个最好的学习。将来无论到军队、政权或其他部门服务，都是为着人民，所以不能不了解人民。刘司令员以一二九师从三支半枪起家发展到几十万人的史实，说明“只要诚心诚意为人民服务，就一定能胜利。”他强有力的号召大家：“我们要帮助农民站起来！站起来！站起来！拿武装保卫自己！保卫中国！”他希望很快接到翻身队的捷报，说：“这捷报与前方自卫战争的捷报一样重要”。
    在首长们热情的鼓舞与嘱咐之后，该队情绪更加高涨，连队与连队、小组与小组、个人与个人之间，纷纷提出竞赛条件，大家都决心要做模范翻身队员，争取模范小组、模范连队。十三日，即分赴沙河、高邑、内黄、邯郸、临漳等县，开始工作。    （寒风、展潮、立云）
    又讯：北大在暑期中，决定停课不放假，号召同学们参加群运，组织帮助群众翻身团下乡。留校同学进行暑期讲习，补习功课。在本月四、五、六三日，进行考试，十日开始进行群众运动学习，二十四日左右，下乡到沙河、邢台等县，帮助群众翻身。该校行政学院的同学们对帮助群众翻身，特别热情，踊跃参加。
