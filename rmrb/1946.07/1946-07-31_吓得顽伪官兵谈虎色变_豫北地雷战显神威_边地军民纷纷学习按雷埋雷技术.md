　　The stubborn and puppet officers and soldiers are terrified
    North Henan landmine warfare shows its power         
    Soldiers and civilians in the border areas are learning landmine planting techniques

    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] With the support of the militia in the old areas of Pingshun, Licheng, Shexian, Huguan, Linxian, and other places, the explosion movement in northern Henan has been widely carried out, striking the stubborn and puppet troops' activities of attacking, harassing, and plundering our border areas. Since the protection of the wheat harvest began, the militia of Pingshun, Li, She, Hu, Lin, and other counties have organized explosion teams and went to various parts of northern Henan. They brought iron mines and various mine-making and mine-laying tools. On the one hand, they combined with the local militia in the border areas to combat the invading stubborn and puppet troops, and on the other hand, they trained the militia in the border areas in mine-making and mine-laying techniques to carry out the explosion movement. When the supporting militia from Licheng first arrived in Qixian and Jixian, the local people looked down on the militia in the old areas, thinking that they didn't have many fast guns, and what use were those iron eggs (referring to landmines)? However, after eight years of hard fighting, they repelled countless enemy and puppet sweeps with landmines and cold shots. They knew that it would only be through actual struggle that the people in the border areas could change their perceptions. They immediately conducted terrain research and set up blockade minefields. During the wheat harvest, the Huguan support team laid mines on the front line of Xiuwu. The stubborn and puppet troops repeatedly came out to harass and plunder food, but were all炸退blown back. The support from Shexian and Linxian in the area west of Huixian and Xinxiang all protected the summer harvest of the people in the border areas. Whenever the landmines boomed, the people in the border areas immediately transferred away from the villages under the cover of the militia, causing the raids of the stubborn and puppet troops to fail. Several raids by the stubborn and puppet troops in Xiuwu, Huixian, Qi, Ji and other places were all injured by the explosions. The troops of Cai Quanlu, a puppet from Qixian, were blown up once and dared not come out to harass for days. The stubborn and puppet officers and soldiers were terrified and warned each other: "The Eighth Route Army has landmines everywhere, so be careful!" At this point, the people in the border areas began to realize the power of landmines and rushed to learn from the support team. Each class of the Qiji camp also drew a soldier to learn mine-laying from the Licheng militia. After the Qiji Beiling, the militia in Xiuwu Xiaoxinzhuang, Motaiying and other places have all learned how to make blasting tubes, load mines, make stone mines, and various burial methods such as stepping mines, bow mines, stone pendulum mines, cliff mines, and mother-child mines, and launched a movement to make stone mines.

　　吓得顽伪官兵谈虎色变
    豫北地雷战显神威         
    边地军民纷纷学习按雷埋雷技术
    【本报长治讯】在老区平顺、黎城、涉县、壶关、林县等地民兵支援下，豫北各地爆炸运动普遍开展打击了顽伪对我边地进攻、袭扰、抢掠的活动。从保卫麦收开始，平、黎、涉、壶、林等县民兵，即组织爆炸队，分赴豫北各地，他们带去了铁雷及各种造雷埋雷工具，一面在边地结合当地民兵打击进犯顽伪，一面即训练边地民兵造雷、埋雷技术，开展爆炸运动。黎城的支援民兵初到淇县、汲县时，当地群众对老区民兵颇为轻视，认为没很多快枪，那些铁蛋（指地雷）顶啥用？但经过八年苦战以地雷、冷枪打退过无数次敌伪扫荡的他们，知道这祗有经过实际斗争，才能转变边地人民的认识。便立即进行地形研究与布设封锁雷阵。麦收中，壶关支援队在修武前线埋雷，顽伪多次出扰抢粮，均被炸退，涉县、林县支援在辉县及新乡以西地区，均保卫了边地人民的夏收。每当地雷轰响时，边地人民即在民兵掩护下转移离村，使顽伪的奔袭失败。修武、辉县、淇汲等地顽伪的数次出扰，均被炸伤，淇县伪才全禄部，一次被炸，日不敢出扰，顽伪官兵谈虎变色，互相警告：“八路军遍地地雷可得小心”！至此边地群众始认识了地雷威力，纷纷向支援队学习。淇汲营兵亦每班抽战士一人向黎城民兵学习埋雷，淇汲北岭后，修武小新庄、磨台营等地民兵，均已学会了造爆炸管、装雷、打造石雷及踏雷、弓雷、石坠雷、崖边雷、子母雷等各种埋法，展开造石雷运动。
