　　Kuomintang Military in Northern Henan Frequently Deploying
    Eager to Invade My Jiaozuo
    [Report from this newspaper in Heze, 11th] The Kuomintang military in northern Henan has been deploying frequently in recent days. On the 2nd, the Kuomintang army increased by one regiment in Changyuan. A portion of the 32nd Army also moved north to Anyang on the 1st. On the 3rd, the Kuomintang army moved one division from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang. On the 5th, another 20 tanks moved from Bian to Xinxiang. On the same day, two regiments of the Kuomintang 27th Division also increased from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang. On the 4th and 5th, the Kuomintang army in Xinxiang transported a large amount of ammunition to Huojia in 12 trucks. On the 6th, one regiment of the Kuomintang 68th Army also increased from Kaifeng to Xinxiang. The 177th Division of the 38th Army also increased to Xinxiang on the 6th. Ammunition and military supplies stored in Xinxiang have been transported north to Tangyin since the 6th. In recent days, the Kuomintang army gathered in Xinxiang is marching north on foot via the southern four routes to Qixian and other places, preparing to attack our Jiaozuo.
    [Report from this newspaper in Handan, 11th] The Anyang team went to northern Anyang on the 5th to investigate the truth about the Kuomintang army's attack on Ma Wangdu. That afternoon, our representative Comrade Dang Chongshan was sent by the Kuomintang to Guojie Village to contact our defense area. At that time, contact was made with the Kuomintang army in the area, and the Kuomintang also guaranteed the safety of our representative. Unexpectedly, when Comrade Dang Chongshan was riding a horse and had traveled several dozen meters out of the Kuomintang position, the Kuomintang army in Guojie Village immediately strafed with machine guns, followed by rifle fire aimed at Comrade Dang, firing several shots in succession, and the horse was seriously wounded. The Kuomintang used despicable means to prevent the team from investigating, resulting in the failure of the team's mediation.

　　豫北国民党军调动频繁
    亟图进犯我焦作
    【本报荷泽十一日电】豫北国民党军连日调动频繁。二日，长垣增加蒋军一个团，三十二军一部亦于一日北开安阳；三日，国民党军由郑州开新乡一个师；五日，又有坦克二十辆由汴开新；同日国民党二十七师两个团，亦由郑州增至新乡；四五两日，新乡国民党军以汽车十二辆运往获嘉大批弹药；六日，国民党六十八军一个团，亦由开封增至新乡；三十八军一七七师，亦于六日增至新乡。储藏于新乡之弹药军火，从六日起，即纷纷北运汤阴。近日来集结新乡的国民党军，正由南四路徒步北开淇县等地，正准备向我焦作进攻。
    【本报邯郸十一日电】安阳小组于五日赴安阳北，调查国民党军进攻我马王度真相。是日下午，我方代表党崇山同志经国方送至郭街村，赴我防区联系，当时曾与该地国民党军取得联络，国方亦曾保证我代表安全。不料当党崇山同志乘马走出国方阵地数十米时，郭街国民党军即以机枪扫射，继以步枪瞄准党同志射击，连发数枪，乘马负重伤。国方以卑鄙手段，阻止小组调查，致使小组调处未获结果。
