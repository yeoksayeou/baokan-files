Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: Paris dispatch: The Council of Foreign Ministers passed the American proposal on July 4 regarding Italian reparations to the Soviet Union, deciding that Italy would pay $100 million in reparations to the Soviet Union, part of which would be paid in Italian industrial products. The basic obstacle to Italian reparations previously lay in the opposition of the United States and Britain to payment of compensation in Italian industrial products. On July 4, they abandoned this stubborn view and agreed that reparations would be paid from Italian industrial products in addition to other sources. Industrial products will begin to be paid within two years after the treaty comes into effect, limited to six years. Other sources include the following: (1) A portion of Italian military equipment that is not permitted as war equipment, factories and tools that are not easily converted to peaceful production. (2) Italian property in the Soviet Union. (3) Italian property in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. (4) The Italian mail ships Vulcan and Saturn (approximately 24,000 tons each). Regarding the payment of Italian products, their value will be determined by the Four-Power Ambassador Committee established in Rome (established to supervise the implementation of the Italian treaty), which will make up for the difference when the above four items do not meet the $100 million.

　　意向苏赔款
    一万万美元
    【新华社延安六日电】巴黎讯：七月四日外长会议通过了美国关于意大利向苏赔款的方案，决定意大利向苏赔款一万万美元，其中一部分规定意大利以工业品来支付。以前关于意大利赔款的基本障碍，在于美英双方反对以意大利工业制品支付赔偿。七月四日他们放弃了这种固见，同意除其他来源以外，以意大利工业品支付赔款。工业品在和约生效后两年内开始支付，以六年为限。其他来源包括下列各项：（１）意大利军事设备中不容许有的战争器具，不容易转变为和平生产之用的工厂及工具器料的一部分。（２）意大利在苏联的财产。（３）在罗、保、匈及在德境苏占领区之意大利财产。（４）意大利邮船火神号及土星号（各种两万四千吨）。关于意大利品的支付，其价值由在罗马设立的四强大使委员会（为监督意大利和约的履行而设）决定它将补足此照上述四项规定不满一万万美金时的差额。
