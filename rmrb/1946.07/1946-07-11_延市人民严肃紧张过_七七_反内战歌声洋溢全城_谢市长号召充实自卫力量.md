　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: The first "July 7th" Anniversary since the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan was observed by all circles in Yan'an in a solemn and tense atmosphere. Yesterday, the entire city displayed national flags. Due to the still serious domestic situation, most personnel in government offices continued to work during the holiday or took only short breaks. The Central Party School specially published a "Learning Bulletin Special Issue," calling on cadres to conduct ideological education and discuss the current situation. The Joint Defense Command convened staff and soldiers for a current affairs symposium. The National Pingtanchildcare Center invited Professor He Sijing, newly returned from Beijing and Shanghai, to report on the suffering and democratic movements in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The Clothing Factory held a meeting of all employees, where Deputy Director Yu Yongquan reported on current affairs, calling on them to intensify technical training and redouble their efforts in production. The New Market blackboard newspaper issued a call to commemorate "July 7th" and oppose civil war, and to strive for national independence, peace, and democracy. The crowds on the streets were constantly stopping to watch. The street poetry and painting performances by the Northwest Cultural Troupe were the most popular among the masses. They satirized the Kuomintang reactionaries' reliance on U.S. imperialism's assistance to attack the Chinese people with great acuteness. The songs included "Military-Civilian Cooperation" and "Oppose the U.S. Military Aid to Chiang Act." When singing "Oppose Military Aid to Chiang" and "Demand the Withdrawal of American Troops," the majestic and resonant singing and the sound of gongs and drums echoed in the air, and the mood was extremely enthusiastic. In the evening, a mass gathering was held at the Public Theater, where the People's Theater Troupe performed to defend peace. Mayor Xie Huaide delivered a brief speech on the spot, calling on the masses to work hard in production, strengthen the construction of the border area, and strengthen self-defense forces, which won enthusiastic applause and support from four thousand spectators.
