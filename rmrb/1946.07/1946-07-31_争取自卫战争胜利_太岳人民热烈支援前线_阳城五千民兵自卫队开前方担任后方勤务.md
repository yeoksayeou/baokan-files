[This newspaper] Yangcheng, 27th – The masses throughout the Taiyue area, upon hearing the news that Chiang Kai-shek was launching an even larger-scale civil war and had already attacked the liberated areas of Central China, Shandong, and Taiyue, have universally launched a movement to support the front lines and strive for victory in the war of self-defense in various production departments and production organizations. The masses and cadres in Shiminyin Village are tensely mobilized. More than sixty able-bodied laborers (including militiamen) and fifty semi-able-bodied laborers have organized stretcher teams and transportation teams to take turns transferring the wounded and sick and public grain. On the 20th and 21st of this month, they dispatched thirty donkeys and five stretchers. Fifteen strong militiamen automatically organized a field group, ready to go to the front at any time to eliminate the attacking die-hard troops. The self-defense forces and militiamen at home are making a surprise attack on weeding the seedlings. They have decided to finish weeding the millet that has not been weeded twice and the late rice planted after cutting wheat by July 25th. The masses in the whole village are working intensely, doing everything for the front. The enthusiastic support of the front lines by Yangcheng farmers has formed a movement. In the middle of this month, five companies of militiamen’s rotation teams have gone to the front to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army in self-defense warfare. Li Yinfeng, a famous militia combat hero from Taiyue, also set off with the team. Before leaving, he told the villagers: "I will not return home until the reactionaries are repelled." Another battalion of militia rotation teams is undergoing training and will soon rush to the front. A stretcher transport team composed of 5,000 militiamen and self-defense forces has gone to the front to undertake rear service. Women throughout the county are busily rushing to make military shoes. The military shoes in Sihou Village were completed within a week. Each village in the fourth district universally held military shoe exhibitions. The one hundred and twenty-two pairs made in Gulong Village were very strong and were rewarded by the mutual aid brigade in this village. Everywhere in the streets and alleys, you can see loads of military shoes being sent to the district government. The Yangcheng County government has now received more than 10,000 pairs of military shoes. When the workers in the sulfur kilns heard the news that the reactionaries were going to fight a civil war and attack the liberated areas, they were very angry. On July 11, the workers held a meeting and unanimously advocated stepping up production to support the front lines. Since the meeting a week ago, the number of furnaces has increased from five to ten, and recently it is planned to increase to fifteen or sixteen. The workers' land is hoed by mutual aid groups, which solves the difficulty of having to work in the kiln and plant the land at the same time.
