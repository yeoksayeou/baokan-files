Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd. The CCP delegation, in protest against the assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo, sent a letter to the government representatives on the 17th. The original text is as follows:

　　To Gentlemen Zhesheng, Tiecheng, Bulei, Lizi, Xuexian, Lisheng, Lifu, Yuejun: And forwarded to Chairman Chiang for his consideration: We respectfully inform you that Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo were assassinated in Kunming one after the other for their enthusiasm in promoting the peace and democracy movement. Mr. Wen's son is seriously injured and in critical condition. Upon hearing this from afar, we are filled with grief and indignation! The government, on the one hand, is launching large-scale offensives against the Liberated Areas of Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Anhui, preparing to create an all-out civil war; on the other hand, it is condoning and instigating secret service agencies to assassinate leaders of peace and democracy in the rear. Such barbaric and despicable methods were not even dared to be carried out wantonly by the governments of the fascist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan. China claims to be a victorious nation in the anti-fascist war, and the Four Pledges are still ringing in our ears, yet secret service atrocities are occurring one after another, spreading throughout the country. The beating in Xiaguan is followed by assassination. Within a city, in the span of five days, two successive tragedies of murder have been staged. How can the government authorities explain themselves? Moreover, according to letters from Kunming, on the day of Mr. Li's misfortune, there were rumors of plans to kill Mr. Wen. Now that these rumors have come true, is it a coincidence? Furthermore, after the cases of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen, it is said that Mr. Deng Chumin and others in Chongqing, and Mr. Shen Junru and Mr. Luo Longji in Shanghai, are all targets for assassination. People are alarmed and the whole country is outraged! If the government authorities have any repentance, fearing the condemnation of history, they should urgently take measures to stop these acts and seek proper solutions. Upon hearing this terrible news, Enlai and others have been unable to sleep at night. In addition to expressing serious protest against the Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo incidents, we specifically request the government to immediately take the following measures and announce them to the whole country: (1) Immediately replace the Kunming Garrison Commander, arrest the murderers within a time limit, hand them over to the court for trial, and have members of the Political Consultative Conference participate in the trial. (2) Give the deceased a public funeral, issue a nationwide mourning order, and provide compensation to the families of the deceased. (3) Strictly instruct local governments and military and police organs to be responsible for protecting the safety of all parties and all democrats. (4) Reiterate the Four Pledges and thoroughly implement them. (5) Investigate the tragedies that have occurred in various places since the Political Consultative Conference and punish the culprits. (6) Abolish all secret service agencies. (7) Release all political prisoners. Enlai and others believe that the government must implement the above minimum requirements in order to demonstrate that the government intends to return to democracy and peace. We hereby submit this and hope to receive a reply within three days. We eagerly await your response and wish you good health! Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Wu Yuzhang, Ye Jianying, Lu Dingyi, Deng Yingchao, Li Weihan, respectfully. July 17, 35th year of the Republic of China.

    哲生、铁城、布雷、力子、雪涎、厉生、立夫、岳军先生公鉴：并转蒋主席赐鉴：敬启者，李公朴、闻一多两先生因热心奔走和平民主运动，竟先后在昆明被暗杀致死，闻先生之公子伤重垂危，远道闻之，悲愤交集！政府既一面大举进攻鄂豫、山东、山西、苏皖各解放区，准备造成全面内战；另一面纵容指使特务机关，在大后方暗杀和平民主领袖。如此野蛮卑鄙手段，虽德意日法西斯国家政府，犹不敢肆意为之，中国号称反法西斯胜利国家，且四项诺言言犹在耳，而特务暴行接踵而至，遍及全国。下关殴打，暗杀继之，一城之内，五日之间，竟至续演杀人惨案两起，不知政府当局何以自解？且据昆明来信所云：李先生被难之日，即有再杀闻先生之风传，今其言果验，岂为偶然？且李、闻两先生之后，还说重庆有邓初民先生等，上海有沈钧儒、罗隆基先生等，皆为暗杀对象，人心惶惶，举国震怒！政府当局如果稍有悔悟，犹惧春秋笔伐，应急起制止，以谋善后。恩来等闻此凶耗，夜不成寐，除对李公朴、闻一多先生事件表示严重抗议外，特要求政府立即采取下列措施，并明令公布全国：（一）立即撤换昆明警备司令，限期缉拿凶手，交法院问罪，并由政协派员陪审。（二）公葬死者，通令全国追悼，并给死者家属以抚恤。（三）严格责成各地政府及军警机关，负责保护各党派及一切民主人士之安全。（四）重申四项诺言，彻底予以实施。（五）撤查政协会议以后各地所发生之惨案，惩办祸首。（六）取消一切特务机关。（七）释放一切政治犯。恩来等认为政府必须实行上列各项最低要求，方足表示政府有重返民主和平之意。特此奉达，并希于三日内赐复，无任企盼，并颂公祺！周恩来、董必武、吴玉章、叶剑英、陆定一、邓颖超、李维汉谨启。民国三十五年七月十七日。
