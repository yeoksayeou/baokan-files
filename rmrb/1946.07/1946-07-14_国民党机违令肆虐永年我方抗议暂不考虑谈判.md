　　【 本报邯郸七日电】 Just as our army was following the orders of the Beiping Executive Headquarters to cease combat operations and conduct peace negotiations to save the compatriots inside Yongnian city, Kuomintang aircraft took the opportunity to bomb and strafe our liberated areas around the city, with increasing intensity. From July 1st to 4th, additional aircraft were dispatched two to three times each day to strafe and bomb. At 10:00 AM on July 1st, two Kuomintang fighter planes strafed the villages of Tanxiapo and Hantun outside the city for 25 minutes. At 4:00 PM, four more fighter planes intruded into the airspace above the liberated areas around the city, bombing and strafing Nanqiao, Dangtou, West Dike, East Guan, and West Guan for 75 minutes, breaking the record for 20 days of bombing. Several houses in our army's defensive positions in the West Guan were hit and caught fire, and two were destroyed. A total of 15 bombs were dropped on our army positions in East Guan and Tanxiapo, wounding nine of our soldiers. One resident of Dangtou village was killed. On the 2nd, three Kuomintang aircraft bombed and strafed us three times, and finally a fighter plane landed inside Yongnian city. On the 3rd, U.S. representative Major McKee and Kuomintang representative Lieutenant Colonel Zhang Chaozheng went to Yongnian for inspection. Just as two Kuomintang "P-51" fighter planes accompanied a transport plane, they bombed and strafed the East Guan, West Guan, and Lizhuang areas of Yongnian for 25 minutes. In front of the air raid shelter in Tanxiapo, the Kuomintang and U.S. representatives personally witnessed the planes strafing and bombing East Guan, causing fires everywhere. Major McKee recorded the plane numbers and bombing locations on a card. Regarding the Kuomintang aircraft's indiscriminate bombing, our representative of the Yongnian group, Colonel Wang Yumin, immediately lodged a serious protest, stating that our side would temporarily not consider the Yongnian negotiations until the Kuomintang aircraft stopped bombing. Since the Kuomintang aircraft began continuously bombing our Yongnian soldiers and civilians on the 11th of last month, all the large and small villages within ten miles around the city have been bombed and strafed, and more than 20 peaceful residents have been killed or injured.

　　国民党机违令肆虐永年我方抗议暂不考虑谈判
    【本报邯郸七日电】正当我军遵照北平执行部命令停止战斗行动，进行和平谈判拯救永年城内同胞之际，国民党飞机竟乘机向我城周解放区轰炸扫射，日益剧烈。自七月一日至四日止，每日均加派飞机两三次，前来扫射轰炸。七月一日上午十时，国民党战斗机两架，在城外我覃下坡韩屯等村上空，扫射二十五分钟，午后四时又有战斗机四架，侵入城周解放区上空，对南桥、当头、西大堤及东西关，大肆轰炸扫射达七十五分钟，打破了二十多天轰炸的纪录。该城西关我军防地驻屋中弹起火数处，两间被焚毁。东关及覃下坡我军阵地共投弹十五枚，炸伤我战士九人，当头村居民一人被炸身死。二日，国民党飞机三架，向我轰炸扫射了三次，最后并有战斗机一架降落永年城内。三日，美方代表麦奇少校及国方代表张朝正中校，前往永年视察，正值国民党“Ｐ．５１”号战斗机两架伴随运输机一架，在永年东西关及李庄一带，大肆轰炸扫射，历时二十五分，国美双方代表于覃下坡防空洞前，亲睹飞机之扫射狂炸东关，到处起火，麦奇少校当将飞机号码及轰炸地点一一记于卡片上。对国民党飞机如此滥施轰炸，永年小组我方代表王豫民上校当即提出严重抗议，在国民党飞机未停止轰炸前，我方暂不考虑永年谈判问题。按国民党飞机自上月十一日向我永年军民连续轰炸以来，沿城周十里以内之大小村庄，悉遭轰炸扫射，和平居民死伤者已达二十余名。
