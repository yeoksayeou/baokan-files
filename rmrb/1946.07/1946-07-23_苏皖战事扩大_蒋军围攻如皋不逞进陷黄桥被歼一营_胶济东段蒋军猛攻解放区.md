Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 19th: Following the invasion of Liuhe, Chiang's army on the eastern section of the southern front in central Jiangsu launched a full-scale offensive on the 17th from Nantong, Jingjiang, Taixing, and Taizhou on a 300-mile front. Chiang's army, massed to the north around Xuzhou on the Longhai Railway, is also waiting for an opportunity to move. The civil war in the Soviet-Anhui region is escalating: (1) Nantong: Chiang's 49th Army began to encircle Rugao County, an important southern town in the Soviet-Anhui border region, on the 17th. One route, the two regiments of the 26th Division, advanced north from Baipu, northwest of Nantong, and have successively occupied the towns of Linzi and Dingyan, southeast of Rugao. Another route, two regiments of the 79th Division, attacked from Pingchao, northwest of Nantong, on the 17th and launched a three-pronged assault on Rugao city on the 18th. The defending troops were forced to counterattack, engaging in a fierce battle in the suburbs for five hours and repelling them. (2) Jingjiang: Two regiments of the Chiang army stationed in Jingjiang attacked north on the morning of the 18th, occupying Guangling Town and Jijiashi, about ten miles north of the city, and continued to advance towards Huangqiao Town, a strategic military location northeast of Taixing. The New Fourth Army rose up in self-defense and annihilated a battalion of Chiang's army. Huangqiao was occupied. (3) Taixing: Chiang's army re-occupied Taixing County on the 16th and continued to occupy Yaojiadai, north of Taixing, with part of its forces. (4) The Chiang army in Taizhou attacked Jiangyan Town in two routes and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the New Fourth Army. People here generally believe that Chiang's army's offensive against the Soviet-Anhui border region is a prelude to launching a nationwide civil war. Its predetermined plan is to first eliminate the Central Plains and Soviet-Anhui liberated areas, so as to extract most of the troops from the Yangtze River basin and launch a full-scale offensive towards North China and Northeast China.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: It is reported that there are approximately 140 armored vehicles of Chiang's army in Jinan, and the drivers are all Japanese who enjoy the rank of captain. It is said that this armored vehicle team will soon appear on the civil war front in Shandong.

Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 16th: (Delayed) The Kuomintang's 54th Army, with two divisions, has been fiercely attacking the liberated areas in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway for several days and has occupied Jiaoxian City. The 198th Division of the army and the puppet army Zhang Qilu's troops suffered a severe blow and retreated during their attack on Nanquan Station (40 li west of Jimo City) on the Jiaoji Railway on the 6th. After reorganization and reinforcement, they attacked Nanquan Station again on the 9th and occupied the station after fierce fighting. The next day, they attacked Lancun Station and, in coordination with more than 2,000 men from the 8th Division of the army who landed from Yindao, captured Ligezhuang Station. On the 12th, they launched a full-scale attack on Jiaoxian City under the cover of heavy artillery fire. After a day of fierce fighting, they occupied Jiaoxian City at 10:00 AM on the 13th at a great cost. According to reports, since the middle of last month, the Kuomintang army has launched a large-scale offensive along the Jiaoji Railway with four armies and twelve divisions, successively occupying important towns such as Zhangqiu, Jimo, Jiyang, Zichuan, Linzi, Zhoucun, and Zhangdian. It had also briefly occupied Yidu City. Jiaoxian City is the seventh county town it has captured.

　　苏皖战事扩大
    蒋军围攻如皋不逞进陷黄桥被歼一营  
    胶济东段蒋军猛攻解放区
    【新华社淮阴十九日电】继对六合之出犯，苏中南线东段蒋军，又于十七日由南通、靖江、泰兴、泰州分路出动，在三百里战线上，发动全面进攻。而北面屯集于陇海路徐州周围之蒋军，亦正在伺隙而动，苏皖地区内战正在日益扩大之中：（１）南通方面，蒋军四十九军于十七日开始，分路攻围苏皖边区南面重镇如皋县城。一路二十六师两个团，自南通西北之白蒲北犯，已连续侵占如皋东南之林梓、丁堰两镇。另一路七十九师两个团，十七日自南通西北之平潮出犯，于十八日三路猛扑如皋城，守军被迫还击，在城郊鏖战五小时，将其击退。（２）靖江方面：驻靖蒋军两个团，于十八日晨北犯，攻占城北十里左右之广陵镇、季家市，并继续向泰兴东北之军事要地黄桥镇进扑。新四军奋起自卫，消灭蒋军一营，黄桥被侵占。（３）泰兴方面：蒋军于十六日再占泰兴县城，并以一部继续攻占泰兴以北之姚家岱。（４）泰州蒋军分两路犯姜堰镇，正与新四军激战中。此间一般人士认为蒋军对苏皖边区之进攻，为发动全国规模内战之前奏。盖其预定计划，在于首先消灭中原、苏皖解放区，以使抽出长江流域大部兵力，向华北、东北全面进攻。
    【新华社延安二十日电】据悉：济南市内蒋军铁甲车队约一百四十余辆，司机全为日人，并享受上尉阶级待遇。闻此铁甲车队，不日即将在山东的内战前线上出现。
    【新华社莱阳十六日电】（迟到）国民党五十四军两个师，连日在胶济路东段猛攻解放区，已侵占胶县城。该军一九八师及伪军张其陆部于六日在进攻胶济路南泉车站（即墨城西四十里）中，遭有力打击溃退后，经重整与增援，复于九日猛犯南泉车站，于激战后侵占该站。次日复袭入蓝村车站，并配合自阴岛登陆之该军第八师两千余人，侵陷李哥庄车站。十二日更倾巢出犯，在猛烈炮火掩护下，猛攻胶县城，激战竟日，于十三日上午十时以巨大牺牲侵占胶县城。按国民党军自上月中旬开始以四个军十二师兵力，在胶济路沿线发动大规模进攻，先后侵占章邱、即墨、济阳、淄川、临淄、周村、张店等重要城镇，并曾一度侵占益都城，此胶县城为遭其侵陷之第七个县城。
