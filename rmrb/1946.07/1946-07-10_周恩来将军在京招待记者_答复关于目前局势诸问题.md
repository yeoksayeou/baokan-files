Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th: General Zhou Enlai of the CCP delegation received reporters in Beijing on the 30th of last month. More than 30 Chinese and foreign reporters attended. General Zhou answered reporters' questions as follows:

Q: The Central Propaganda Department's announcement today stated that "the plan for implementing military reorganization and the agreement on designated garrison areas should be established within a time limit." I wonder what the time limit is?

A: I don't know. When I met with General Marshall today, he did not mention it either.

Q: Do you think the current situation is an extension of the ceasefire?

A: I received a notification from General Marshall saying that the government is about to issue a statement saying that it will continue to cease offensive operations and continue negotiations. He said this is just a statement, and I have not seen the government order a continuation of the ceasefire. Mr. Peng's statement said that there would be no offensive under certain circumstances, and there would still be military action under other circumstances, so it cannot be considered a limited ceasefire, let alone a long-term truce. Perhaps the beauty of Mr. Peng's statement lies in this. For example, in Jiangbei, the government now has several armies, armed with so-called "refugees returning home," and is preparing to launch an offensive towards northern Jiangsu under the pretext of "protecting the people." Also, the government's Eighth Army on the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong is launching an offensive against us under the pretext of "protecting transportation," and occupied Yidu on the 3rd. In events like these, the government can always find excuses to launch a war. Furthermore, the announcement contains the words "expel," what is that if not an attack? Of course, according to Mr. Peng's words, peace may be temporarily maintained in areas where the Kuomintang army does not intend to launch an offensive for the time being. In short, this announcement can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on which one you are willing to use, which is the beauty of this announcement.

Q: According to various newspapers, the key to military reorganization seems to be the defense area issue. I wonder how the defense areas are actually divided?

A: The issue of military garrison locations is one of the issues in the military reorganization plan. The military reorganization plan has already made principled provisions, such as how many troops will be stationed in North China and how many in Central China. Now it is necessary to concretize it, such as where the divisions will be stationed and where the army headquarters will be stationed. According to the military part of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolution and the provisions of the military reorganization plan, this issue should not be discussed separately from political issues. The principle of the PCC resolution is separation of military and civilian administration, governing the army politically, and separation of the army and the party. Therefore, these issues can only be handled after the government is organized and a democratic and unified Ministry of National Defense is established. However, the government insists on discussing the issue of army garrison locations first. In order to achieve peace, we have made concessions and agreed to discuss the issue of garrison locations first. However, we must not change the military reorganization principles stipulated by the PCC, and the formal reorganization of the army must be carried out by the reorganized Ministry of National Defense through the Military Mediation and Execution Department. During the reorganization, the army should be separated from local administration and should not interfere in local administration. Another principle of military reorganization is the division of labor among military training, military administration, and military command. This was proposed by General Marshall based on the spirit of the American military system. According to this principle, the supply area has no military command authority, the army is responsible for combat during wartime and training during peacetime, and the Chairman of the National Government exercises command through the Ministry of National Defense and must obtain the consent of the National Government Committee or the National Assembly. Therefore, the current discussion of the garrison location issue should not violate these basic principles. Now the government's proposal actually links the army garrison locations with local civil administration, turning it into a defense area system or military control area/division control area system in which the military interferes with politics. This is the difference between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on this issue. The government believes that northern Jiangsu threatens Nanjing, Chengde and Zhangjiakou threaten Peiping, and the Communist troops along the railway threaten transportation and should all be withdrawn, which is completely unreasonable. Because after the reorganization and unification, everyone is a national army, and it cannot be said that one threatens the other. Conversely, if we also say that Nanjing threatens northern Jiangsu, Peiping threatens Chengde and Zhangjiakou, and the troops stationed on the railway threaten the nearby counties and villages, then the problem cannot be solved. Such a statement does not proceed from a national point of view. Although the government's demands are so unreasonable, we still made concessions and agreed not to station troops in some areas. However, the government is not satisfied and insists that the party, government, military, and civilian groups in these areas must all withdraw, which is too unreasonable and exceeds the scope of military reorganization. We cannot accept or consider it.

Q: What is the content of the transitional plan proposed by Marshall? Which points are acceptable to the CCP?

A: The government has not yet agreed to this plan, and I am not in a position to announce its contents, but I can tell you that the CCP agrees with most of it, and extremely important parts of it, including the principles of garrisoning troops, the ratio of troops, and the handling of the Northeast issue. However, the government insists on "taking over" the areas it designates, which has prevented this plan from being agreed upon. Now the government's "takeover" has developed from the Northeast to the interior. If this logic continues, it will only be complete when it "takes over" Yan'an.

Q: Do you think that if the government largely accepted General Marshall's transitional plan, then an agreement could have been reached today, instead of just issuing a vague statement like now?

A: Yes.

Q: Will future negotiations be based on the transitional plan proposed by General Marshall?

A: I hope so.

Q: Will future negotiations be conducted through a three-person meeting or indirect negotiations?

A: I think both methods may be used.

Q: Since military reorganization takes the reorganization of the government as a prerequisite, and the CCP has not yet raised the issue of reorganizing the government, how will this agreement be implemented even if a military reorganization agreement is reached?

A: Yes, we have repeatedly proposed reopening the PCC meeting, or at least convening the PCC Comprehensive Group meeting to solve political issues at the same time, and we have also made suggestions to Chairman Chiang and government representatives. However, the government insists on discussing the issue of military reorganization first and is not active in convening the PCC. In order to achieve peace, we also accommodate the government, but we have not abandoned this position and are still urging the government to convene the PCC meeting and its working groups as soon as possible. We believe that this is also a way to break the deadlock.

Q: Since the issue of reorganizing the government is a matter of principle, but according to newspaper reports, it seems that General Marshall focuses on resolving practical details. Is this the case?

A: No, Marshall pays great attention to principles, otherwise, how would the military reorganization plan have been produced? However, when solving problems, we always have to talk about specific issues first. The Chinese government must be reorganized, which is in line with Truman's statement of December 15th last year and the Moscow Three-Power Communiqué. General Marshall is also very concerned about this, but this issue is not within the scope of the three-person meeting.

Q: I recently read in the newspaper that there are rumors that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu will withdraw. Is this true?

A: This is not true.

Q: How do you explain the Central Propaganda Department's announcement that Weixian, Dawenkou, Datong, and other places were attacked?

A: The Weixian conflict was caused by the Kuomintang Eighth Army attacking Yidu and occupying the area. In order to contain them, our army destroyed the railway there to prevent their attack, which is the state of war. The Dawenkou incident happened a long time ago. I have not heard of the current rumors. As for Datong, Yan Xishan is using Japanese and puppet troops to attack south. We have concentrated some troops near Datong to contain them. I can responsibly state that there has been no attack on Datong. On the contrary, in the Yu-E border area, the government has been attacking Li Xiannian's New Fourth Army in the Central Plains Military Region for five days. The government's attacking forces have nine armies and twenty-one divisions and have occupied four strategic points. The Ping-Han Railway is now in fierce fighting on both sides. The government's plan is to encircle and annihilate our army there, but the government is propagating that our army is moving north. Now we have lost contact with that area by radio. I think that for the sake of self-defense, our army there may try to avoid being annihilated by the government army in areas where their forces are weak.

　　周恩来将军在京招待记者
    答复关于目前局势诸问题
    【新华社南京七日电】中共代表团周恩来将军于上月三十日在京招待记者，到中外记者三十余人，周将军答复记者问题如下：
    问：今日中宣部之公告中曾称“整军实施方案与指定驻军地区之协定限期成立”，不知限期多久？
    答：不知道，今天我见马歇尔将军时，他也未提及。
    问：你是否认为现在的局势是休战的延长呢？
    答：我从马歇尔将军处得到通知，他说：政府将要发表一个文告，内容是继续停止进攻，继续谈判，说这只是一个文告，未见政府下令继续休战。彭先生之声明说在此种情况下不进攻，在另一种情况下还要有军事行动，所以说这不能算有限期的休战，更不算是长期停战，也许彭先生的妙处就在此。比如在江北，政府现在有几个军，武装所谓“难民还乡”，且正准备借“保民”名义，先向苏北发动进攻；又如在山东胶济路上之政府第八军，借“保护交通”名义向我发动进攻，已于三日占领益都。诸如此类事件，政府可以随时找到借口来发动战争。并且公告中写着“驱除”两字，这不是进攻是什么？当然照彭先生的话看来，在国民党军队暂不拟发动进攻的地方，或可暂保和平。总之，这个公告可作多种不同之解释，看你愿意用那一个，这就是这个公告的妙处。
    问：据各报所载，整军的关键似为防区问题，不知防区究是如何划分？
    答：关于整军驻地问题，是整军方案中的一个问题，整军方案中已作了原则规定，如华北驻多少，华中驻多少，现在则要把它具体化，如师驻于何处，军部驻于何处，依政协决议的军事部分与整军方案之规定，此问题不该与政治问题分开来谈。政协决议的原则是军民分治、以政治军、军党分离，因此只有先组织政府，成立民主统一的国防部，才能处理这些问题。但政府坚持要先谈军队驻地问题，我们为求得和平，又作了让步，答应先谈驻地问题，然而决不能改变政协规定的整军原则，及军队的正式整编，必须由改组后的国防部，经军事调处执行部来执行。在整编中，军队应与地方行政分开，不应干涉地方行政。整军的另一原则，就是军训、军政、军令分工，这是马歇尔将军根据美国军事制度的精神提议的。按此原则，补给区没有军队指挥权，军队在战时管作战，平时管训练，而国府主席，则经过国防部行使统帅权，并须取得国府委员会或国会之同意。因此目前谈驻地问题，不应该违反这些基本原则。现在政府提案，竟把军队驻地和当地民政连系一起，变成以军干政的防区制或军管区、师管区制，这就是国共两党在这个问题上的分歧。政府认为苏北威胁南京，承德、张家口威胁北平，铁路沿线中共部队威胁交通，应一概撤退，实在毫无道理。因为整编、统编之后，大家都是国家军队，不能说谁威胁谁；反过来，如果我们也说南京威胁苏北，北平威胁承德、张家口，铁道线上驻军威胁附近各县村庄，那末问题便无法解决了。这样的提法，并不是从国家观点出发的。政府要求虽然如此不合理，但我们还是让了步，答应在某些地区不驻兵，然而政府还不满足，一定要这些地方的党、政、军、民的团体一律撤出，实在太不合理了，而且超出整军的范围，是我们不能接受也不能考虑的。
    问：马歇尔所提的过渡方案内容是什么？其中那几点是中共所能接受的？
    答：此方案政府尚未同意，其内容我也不便宣布，但可奉告诸位：中共对其中绝大部分，而且是极其重要的部分，包括驻军原则、军队比例和东北问题的处理等，大部是同意的，但政府坚持要“接收”其所指定的区域，致此方案未被同意。现在政府的“接收”，已从东北发展到关内来了，照这样逻辑发展下去，最后只有“接收”到延安才算完毕。
    问：你觉得马歇尔将军之过渡方案，政府若大部接受，那么今天就可以成立一个协议，而不致像现在仅发表一个含混的声明么？
    答：是的。
    问：以后商谈，是否还根据马歇尔将军所提之过渡办法？
    答：我希望如此。
    问：以后商谈的方式，是用三人会议，还是间接商谈？
    答：我想可能两种方式都用。
    问：整军既以改组政府为先决条件，而中共至今尚未提出改组政府问题，即使整军获得协议，此项协议将如何执行？
    答：对的，我们曾经数度提出重开政协会议，至少应召开政协综合小组会议来同时解决政治问题，并会在致蒋主席及政府代表之建议书提出过；但政府坚持先谈整军问题，对召开政协并不积极。我们为了实现和平，也就迁就政府，但我们并未放弃这个主张，同时仍在督促政府召开政协会议，迅即召开政协及其小组会议，我们认为这也是打开僵局的一条出路。
    问：改组政府问题，既系原则问题，但据报纸所载，似乎马歇尔将军着重于实际细则问题的解决，是否如此？
    答：不是，马歇尔很注重原则，否则整军方案，何由产生，不过解决问题的时候，总要先谈具体的问题。中国政府是必须改组，是符合于去年十二月十五日杜鲁门声明及莫斯科三国公告的。马歇尔将军对此亦甚关心，但此问题不在三人会议范围之内。
    问：近阅报载苏北中共军有将撤退之说，是否属实？
    答：并无此事。
    问：你对中宣部公告中所称潍县、大汶口、大同等地被攻之事，如何解释？
    答：潍县冲突，系该处国民党第八军向益都进攻，并进占该地，我军为牵制起见，曾破坏该地铁路以阻止其进攻，这是战争中的状态。大汶口事早已过去，目前之传说，我并无所闻。大同方面系阎锡山利用日伪军向南进攻，我们曾在大同附近集中军队若干，加以牵制，我可负责声明绝无进攻大同之事。相反的，在豫鄂边我方中原军区，政府已向新四军李先念部进攻五天了，政府进攻之部队有九个军二十一个师，已占领了四个战略要点，刻平汉路两侧均在激战中。政府的计划，是要围歼该地我军，而政府却在宣传我军向北移动。现我们已与该地失掉电讯联络，据我想该地我军为自卫计，可能于政府军队兵力薄弱之处，设法避开惨遭消灭的命运。
