Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th: General Zhou Enlai of the CCP delegation received reporters in Beijing on the 30th of last month. More than 30 Chinese and foreign reporters attended. General Zhou answered reporters' questions as follows:

Q: The Central Propaganda Department's announcement today stated that "the plan for implementing military reorganization and the agreement on designated garrison areas should be established within a time limit." I wonder what the time limit is?

A: I don't know. When I met with General Marshall today, he did not mention it either.

Q: Do you think the current situation is an extension of the ceasefire?

A: I received a notification from General Marshall saying that the government is about to issue a statement saying that it will continue to cease offensive operations and continue negotiations. He said this is just a statement, and I have not seen the government order a continuation of the ceasefire. Mr. Peng's statement said that there would be no offensive under certain circumstances, and there would still be military action under other circumstances, so it cannot be considered a limited ceasefire, let alone a long-term truce. Perhaps the beauty of Mr. Peng's statement lies in this. For example, in Jiangbei, the government now has several armies, armed with so-called "refugees returning home," and is preparing to launch an offensive towards northern Jiangsu under the pretext of "protecting the people." Also, the government's Eighth Army on the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong is launching an offensive against us under the pretext of "protecting transportation," and occupied Yidu on the 3rd. In events like these, the government can always find excuses to launch a war. Furthermore, the announcement contains the words "expel," what is that if not an attack? Of course, according to Mr. Peng's words, peace may be temporarily maintained in areas where the Kuomintang army does not intend to launch an offensive for the time being. In short, this announcement can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on which one you are willing to use, which is the beauty of this announcement.

Q: According to various newspapers, the key to military reorganization seems to be the defense area issue. I wonder how the defense areas are actually divided?

A: The issue of military garrison locations is one of the issues in the military reorganization plan. The military reorganization plan has already made principled provisions, such as how many troops will be stationed in North China and how many in Central China. Now it is necessary to concretize it, such as where the divisions will be stationed and where the army headquarters will be stationed. According to the military part of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolution and the provisions of the military reorganization plan, this issue should not be discussed separately from political issues. The principle of the PCC resolution is separation of military and civilian administration, governing the army politically, and separation of the army and the party. Therefore, these issues can only be handled after the government is organized and a democratic and unified Ministry of National Defense is established. However, the government insists on discussing the issue of army garrison locations first. In order to achieve peace, we have made concessions and agreed to discuss the issue of garrison locations first. However, we must not change the military reorganization principles stipulated by the PCC, and the formal reorganization of the army must be carried out by the reorganized Ministry of National Defense through the Military Mediation and Execution Department. During the reorganization, the army should be separated from local administration and should not interfere in local administration. Another principle of military reorganization is the division of labor among military training, military administration, and military command. This was proposed by General Marshall based on the spirit of the American military system. According to this principle, the supply area has no military command authority, the army is responsible for combat during wartime and training during peacetime, and the Chairman of the National Government exercises command through the Ministry of National Defense and must obtain the consent of the National Government Committee or the National Assembly. Therefore, the current discussion of the garrison location issue should not violate these basic principles. Now the government's proposal actually links the army garrison locations with local civil administration, turning it into a defense area system or military control area/division control area system in which the military interferes with politics. This is the difference between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on this issue. The government believes that northern Jiangsu threatens Nanjing, Chengde and Zhangjiakou threaten Peiping, and the Communist troops along the railway threaten transportation and should all be withdrawn, which is completely unreasonable. Because after the reorganization and unification, everyone is a national army, and it cannot be said that one threatens the other. Conversely, if we also say that Nanjing threatens northern Jiangsu, Peiping threatens Chengde and Zhangjiakou, and the troops stationed on the railway threaten the nearby counties and villages, then the problem cannot be solved. Such a statement does not proceed from a national point of view. Although the government's demands are so unreasonable, we still made concessions and agreed not to station troops in some areas. However, the government is not satisfied and insists that the party, government, military, and civilian groups in these areas must all withdraw, which is too unreasonable and exceeds the scope of military reorganization. We cannot accept or consider it.

Q: What is the content of the transitional plan proposed by Marshall? Which points are acceptable to the CCP?

A: The government has not yet agreed to this plan, and I am not in a position to announce its contents, but I can tell you that the CCP agrees with most of it, and extremely important parts of it, including the principles of garrisoning troops, the ratio of troops, and the handling of the Northeast issue. However, the government insists on "taking over" the areas it designates, which has prevented this plan from being agreed upon. Now the government's "takeover" has developed from the Northeast to the interior. If this logic continues, it will only be complete when it "takes over" Yan'an.

Q: Do you think that if the government largely accepted General Marshall's transitional plan, then an agreement could have been reached today, instead of just issuing a vague statement like now?

A: Yes.

Q: Will future negotiations be based on the transitional plan proposed by General Marshall?

A: I hope so.

Q: Will future negotiations be conducted through a three-person meeting or indirect negotiations?

A: I think both methods may be used.

Q: Since military reorganization takes the reorganization of the government as a prerequisite, and the CCP has not yet raised the issue of reorganizing the government, how will this agreement be implemented even if a military reorganization agreement is reached?

A: Yes, we have repeatedly proposed reopening the PCC meeting, or at least convening the PCC Comprehensive Group meeting to solve political issues at the same time, and we have also made suggestions to Chairman Chiang and government representatives. However, the government insists on discussing the issue of military reorganization first and is not active in convening the PCC. In order to achieve peace, we also accommodate the government, but we have not abandoned this position and are still urging the government to convene the PCC meeting and its working groups as soon as possible. We believe that this is also a way to break the deadlock.

Q: Since the issue of reorganizing the government is a matter of principle, but according to newspaper reports, it seems that General Marshall focuses on resolving practical details. Is this the case?

A: No, Marshall pays great attention to principles, otherwise, how would the military reorganization plan have been produced? However, when solving problems, we always have to talk about specific issues first. The Chinese government must be reorganized, which is in line with Truman's statement of December 15th last year and the Moscow Three-Power Communiqu√©. General Marshall is also very concerned about this, but this issue is not within the scope of the three-person meeting.

Q: I recently read in the newspaper that there are rumors that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu will withdraw. Is this true?

A: This is not true.

Q: How do you explain the Central Propaganda Department's announcement that Weixian, Dawenkou, Datong, and other places were attacked?

A: The Weixian conflict was caused by the Kuomintang Eighth Army attacking Yidu and occupying the area. In order to contain them, our army destroyed the railway there to prevent their attack, which is the state of war. The Dawenkou incident happened a long time ago. I have not heard of the current rumors. As for Datong, Yan Xishan is using Japanese and puppet troops to attack south. We have concentrated some troops near Datong to contain them. I can responsibly state that there has been no attack on Datong. On the contrary, in the Yu-E border area, the government has been attacking Li Xiannian's New Fourth Army in the Central Plains Military Region for five days. The government's attacking forces have nine armies and twenty-one divisions and have occupied four strategic points. The Ping-Han Railway is now in fierce fighting on both sides. The government's plan is to encircle and annihilate our army there, but the government is propagating that our army is moving north. Now we have lost contact with that area by radio. I think that for the sake of self-defense, our army there may try to avoid being annihilated by the government army in areas where their forces are weak.
