　　【This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch of the 17th】 In the self-defense war on the outskirts of Wenxi, southern Shanxi, following the major victory at Yanzhangzhen on the 13th, a regiment of the Chiang army's First Army 167th Division was completely annihilated by our army on the 14th and 15th. After this regiment invaded Wenxi city on the 11th and found nothing, it launched a fierce attack on Ruyi Shangchao, Ruyi Xiachao, Zhaojiazhuang and other places 20 li southeast of the city on the 14th. Our army waited at leisure and met the attack head-on. After a fierce battle until 6:00 a.m. on the 15th, the entire Chiang army regiment was wiped out. It is estimated that more than 800 invading soldiers were killed or wounded, and more than 700 laid down their weapons. The captured items included 6 mountain guns, 11 mortars, 2 small cannons, 2 flat-trajectory guns, 13 heavy machine guns, more than 30 light machine guns, more than 300 rifles, and a large amount of other ammunition. When the local people heard the news, they were all overjoyed and enthusiastically comforted the troops.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Rugao, 15th】 More than 600 men of the 99th Division of the Kuomintang Army's 99th Army (now renamed the 99th Brigade of the 99th Division), stationed more than 10 li east of Jingjiang City, invaded Guangling (16 li north of Jingjiang City) and Gushan (10 li east of Jingjiang City) in two routes at 10:00 a.m. on the 7th of this month. The Kuomintang army, which invaded Guangling Town, consisted of more than 400 people, carrying one large cannon and 18 light machine guns. They launched an attack from Jingjiang City in three routes. Its vanguard of more than 100 people once broke into Guangling Town and looted the people's property. Under the heroic resistance of our local armed forces and militia, more than 30 people were killed or wounded, and the invading army in all directions immediately collapsed.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 16th】 The Kuomintang army on the Nantong-to-Yangzhou line has completed its deployment for a large-scale offensive and has begun to make continuous probing attacks. The 25th Army (New 25th Division) stationed in Yangzhou has ordered its units to attack Shaobo and Gaoyou in the middle of this month. The 49th Army (New 49th Division) stationed in Nantong and the 100th Army (New 83rd Division) stationed in Taizhou and Taixing are preparing to simultaneously cooperate in attacking Rugao and Hai'an. On June 30, Army Commander Li Tianxia held a military conference in Taixing, and Tang Enbo went to Taizhou again on July 1 to plan the civil war. Since June 26, the 100th Army stationed in Taixing and the 99th Army in Jingjiang have successively attacked Huangqiao, Guangling, Gushan and other places, but were repelled by our local army and civilians. On the 10th of this month, the Kuomintang army and puppet troops in Taixing occupied Jiangjiadian near Huangqiao in our territory. The Kuomintang 49th Army stationed in Baipu (northwest of Nantong) attacked the front line of Linzi Town (north of Baipu) on July 1st and 2nd, but was thwarted by our resistance.
