Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 5th: Ninety-eight people from various circles in Hunan and Guangdong, including He Xiangning, Xu Fu'ni, Peng Zemin, and Cai Tingkai, jointly sent a telegram on the 23rd of last month to Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, representatives of various parties, social figures, US President Truman, the US Congress, and domestic and foreign news media, calling for a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the implementation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions; they also demanded that the United States cease all measures that could fuel China's civil war. In the telegram to Chiang, Mao, and representatives of various parties, they stated: "The truce negotiations on the 23rd must reach a permanent peace agreement. Peace talks have reached the last opportunity; success or failure is related to the rise and fall of the nation and the happiness and misfortune of future generations. Therefore, these negotiations can only succeed and cannot fail, they should only be extended and not terminated. The ceasefire in the Northeast must become a comprehensive ceasefire, and temporary peace must become permanent peace. Transportation must be restored, the army must be reorganized, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference must be implemented one by one before the nation can have hope of revival. At present, the people's livelihood is on the verge of despair, and millions of disaster victims are dying one after another. How can we bear to kill each other again and cut off the chance of survival? The people of the whole country are eager for peace and hope that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be patient and that other parties and prominent figures will do their best to assist." In the telegram to US President Truman and the US Senate and House of Representatives, they stated: "The steps currently taken by your government to aid China, such as continuing to provide the Nationalist government with Lend-Lease materials, airlifting Nationalist troops to the north, and stationing US Marines in North China, are making China's civil war increasingly extensive, the arrogance of dictatorship is rising, and the hope of peace is becoming increasingly slim. This cannot but make the Chinese people feel disappointed and regretful! Obviously, your government has not complied with the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution on the China issue and is not in line with your President's 'Statement on China Policy'." They also stated: "For the sake of China's peace and world peace, and to consolidate the deep friendship between the Chinese and American peoples and promote the sound development of Sino-US relations, the Chinese people hope that your government will quickly take fair and effective steps to stop all measures that could fuel China's civil war." Signatories: Kuomintang veteran He Xiangning, National Socialist Party leader Xu Fu'ni, Third Party leaders Peng Zemin, Li Zhangda, and Li Bo, former 19th Route Army generals Cai Tingkai and Tiao Qixiu, and well-known figures in cultural and educational circles Sa Kongliao, Qian Jiaju, Di Chaobai, Liu Simu, Chen Cisheng, Sima Wensen, and Huang Lemian, among others, totaling ninety-eight people.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 5th: Singapore Dispatch: Yu, chairman of the Singapore branch of the Democratic League, sent a telegram to US President Truman on the 27th of last month, stating: "Peace and democracy have not yet been achieved in China. The Chinese people sincerely hope that friendly countries can treat China with goodwill and maintain a fair and impartial attitude when conducting mediation work. On behalf of tens of millions of Chinese people in Southeast Asia, I appeal to Your Excellency and the American people to withdraw your troops stationed in China as soon as possible and not to provide military or economic assistance to any party involved in the civil war. In addition, we hope that your country will be cautious about lending money to China before the establishment of a democratic coalition government in China, so as to avoid prolonging the civil war and endangering peace in the Far East."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 6th: Chongqing Dispatch: The World Science Society recently issued a declaration on the current situation, calling for peace and demanding that the United States stop its policy of fueling China's civil war. The declaration pointed out: "What the Chinese people need today is a comprehensive ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire; military dictatorship can never achieve the goal of unification, only peace and democracy are in line with the people's wishes." It continued: "The United States is now adopting a two-faced policy towards China: on the one hand, mediating China's civil war; on the other hand, fueling China's civil war. This attitude is obviously contrary to the will of the Chinese and American people, and inconsistent with the statements of Presidents Roosevelt and Truman. If this policy is not changed, the Chinese people will never tolerate it, and American interests in China will be deeply harmed." The declaration called on the US government to "earnestly implement the decision of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference on the China issue, and at the same time, in accordance with the precedent of the Soviet troop withdrawal, withdraw all US troops currently stationed in China."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 6th: Chongqing Dispatch: The local middle school teachers and staff association recently sent telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Mao, calling for a political solution to domestic problems, a permanent ceasefire, and demanding that the Kuomintang authorities transfer military spending to education funding. The association also telegraphed Marshall, hoping that the resolutions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference would continue to be mediated.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 4th: Shanghai Dispatch: One hundred and four Chinese film and drama workers, including Zheng Junli, Wu Zuguang, Xia Yan, Yu Ling, Song Zhi's, Feng Zi, Qin Yi, Bai Yang, Wu Yin, and Wang Ping, jointly sent a letter at the end of June to various American film companies and theater union associations, forwarding it to all American drama and film workers, requesting them to jointly call on the US authorities to change their current China policy, immediately withdraw the army, navy, and air force stationed in China, immediately stop helping either side in the war with munitions, strictly maintain neutrality, and expose the conspiracy of the isolationists.

    【新华社延安六日电】渝讯：世界科学社顷发表对时局宣言，呼吁和平，要求美国停止助长中国内战的政策，该宣言指出：“今天中国人民需要的是全面停战，是永久停战；武力独裁，决不能达到统一的目的，只有和平民主，方是符合于人民的愿望的”。继称：“美国现在采取两面的对华政策：一面调停中国内战；加一面又在助长中国内战。这种态度显然和中美人民的意志大相违悖，和故罗斯福及杜鲁门两总统的声明不相符合。这个政策如不改变，中国人民决不能容忍，而美国在华权益，亦必深受扰害”。该宣言呼吁美国政府“认真执行莫斯科三外长会议关于中国问题的决定，同时依照苏军撤退的先例，把现在所有驻华的美军一律撤退”。
