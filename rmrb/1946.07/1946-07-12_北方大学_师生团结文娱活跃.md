　　Northern University
　  Teachers and Students United, Cultural Activities Flourish
    [Report from this newspaper in Xingtai] Since its establishment, Northern University has been developing and improving under the efforts of all faculty and staff. Students and teachers respect and love each other, and the entire school is filled with an atmosphere of democracy and unity. Teachers often personally go to the dining hall, classrooms, and dormitories to solicit students' opinions and constantly improve teaching methods and living conditions. Extracurricular activities at the school are also very active. In addition to formal studies, students compile various publications and wall newspapers. Students on the eighth and ninth floors alone have compiled as many as nine wall newspapers, including "Learning News," "Public Garden," "New Direction," "Life Wall Newspaper," "North," "Battlefield Morning Light," "Metamorphosis," and "Thought Garden." Female students also publish their own wall newspaper separately. These publications and newspapers are gardens for every student's free thought and expression, where everyone can express their opinions and thoughts on various aspects. In terms of cultural entertainment, more than 40 students have organized the Northern University Art Troupe, which is currently performing the operas "Looking Towards Wu Manyou's Direction" and "Yan'an Production Chorus." With the efforts of all members, it will soon meet with the military and civilians of our city. At the same time, the Peking Opera Research Society organized by the Education College is rehearsing the famous play "Driven to Join the Liangshan Rebels."

　　北方大学
　  师生团结文娱活跃
    【本报邢台讯】北大自开办以来，在全体教职员努力下，日趋发展健全。同学师生之间相敬相爱，全校生活洋溢民主、团结的空气。老师们常亲自到饭厅及课堂宿舍，征求学员意见，不断改善教学方法和生活。学校课外活动也很活跃，同学们除去正式学习外，自编各种刊物和墙报，仅八楼九楼同学，即编有“学习报”、“大众园地”、“新方向”、“生活墙报”、“北方”、“战地晨光”、“蜕变”、“思想园地”等墙报达九种之多。女生亦单独出有墙报。这些刊物和报纸都是每个同学自由思想言论的园地，大家都能在这上边发表自己对各方面的意见和思想。文化娱乐方面，已有四十多名学生组织了北大文艺工作团，现正演歌剧“向吴满有方向看齐”“延安生产大合唱”，在全体团员努力之下，不日将与我市军民见面。同时教育学院组织的平剧研究社，正排演名剧“逼上梁山”。
