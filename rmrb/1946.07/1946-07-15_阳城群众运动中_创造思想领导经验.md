　　【News from Yangcheng of this newspaper】The Seventh District of Yangcheng gained some experience in ideological leadership during the transition from the anti-traitor movement to the rent reduction, debt clearance, and wage increase movement: First, the peasants' thoughts and awakening come from their own life experiences. Farmer Cao Huishan said when digging out the "root of poverty": "The fortune teller used to say that I would have good luck at the age of twenty-eight. Why did I only have good luck when the Eighth Route Army came?" Another old man said, "He miscalculated the year and month." Another person said, "Why do we all have good luck when the Eighth Route Army comes? It's conceivable that fortune tellers in the past were all fake!" Farmer Zhang Yungong recounted how he used a five-jin iron hammer to lift a thousand-jin stone in Shandong, opening up a lot of mountain land; and how he suffered in Shanxi to open up a Qing of wasteland, making everyone clear that good farmland is exchanged for labor, and belongs to the farmers, not the landlords. The leader's responsibility lies in guiding the peasants to recall their own experiences and the experiences of others, not in empty talk about exploitation. Second, at the beginning, the peasants can only see a little of what they have experienced: for example, someone who has been blackmailed by an official once thinks that only the official is bad; someone who sees that they have been exploited and lost their land in their lifetime thinks that exploitation is the "root of poverty"; some people think that exploitation is not the "root of poverty" because their father or grandfather did not leave them land. The leadership should guide the peasants to reason, from this person to that person, from now to the past, so that they can figure out that exploitation is the total "root of poverty." Third, some peasants can recognize rental exploitation, but cannot recognize employment exploitation. Hired worker Pei Xiaosheng said, "I earn money from people and work for them, I am not exploited." But someone asked him back, "Why did you lose your land? Why did you become a hired worker?" He suddenly figured it out. Later, after calculating the grain he produced and the wages he earned, he understood even more that he was also being exploited as a hired worker now. Some tenants feel that the landlord's rent increase later is exploitation, and there was no exploitation when the rent was not increased before. After calculating the rent account, they also understood that they were being exploited before. Fourth, to make the peasants realize that "peasants are one family," it is best to inspire them in everyone's shared suffering. "Why do everyone suffer?" This question made everyone suddenly realize the common fate of the peasants.

　　阳城群众运动中
　  创造思想领导经验
    【本报阳城讯】阳城七区在由反奸转入减租清债增资运动中，获得一些思想领导的经验：一、农民思想与觉醒，是从其自身生活经历中来的，农民曹会善在挖“穷根”时说：“以前算命的说我二十八岁就要交运，为什到八路军来了才交运？”另一老汉说：“他算错了年月。”又一人说：“为什咱们都是八路军来才交运？可想以前算命都是假的！”农民张云功历述他在山东如何用五斤重的铁头掀开千斤重的石头，开出多少山地；到山西又如何受苦，才开了顷把荒，使大家明确了良田是劳力换来，是农民的，不是地主的。领导者的责任乃在于诱导农民去回想自身经历与旁人经历，不要空谈剥削。二、农民一开始只能看到自己所经历的一点：如有人受了一次当官的讹诈，认为只是官不好；有人看到自己这一辈子被剥削失去土地，认为剥削是“穷根”；有的人因为父亲或祖父没给留下地，就认为剥削不是“穷根”。领导上应该引导农民推理，从这人推到那人，从现在推到过去，才能想清剥削是总“穷根”。三、有的农民能认识租佃剥削，认不清雇庸剥削。雇工裴小胜说：“咱赚人家钱，给人家做活，没有受剥削。”但有人反问他：“你为什没了土地？，为什当了雇工？”他一下想开了。后来算算自己劳动生产的粮食和所赚的工资，更明白了自己现在当雇工也受剥削。有的佃户觉得后来地主加租是剥削，以前不加租时没有剥削。经过算租佃账，也明白了以前就受剥削。四、要叫农民认识“农民是一家”，最好在大家一块诉苦中启发。“为什大家都有苦呢？”这一反问使大家恍然悟到了农民的共同命运。
