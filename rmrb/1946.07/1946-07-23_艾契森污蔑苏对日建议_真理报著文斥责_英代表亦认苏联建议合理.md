　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 19th: Pravda published an article by Zaslavsky titled "Arthur's Giant Servant in America," which stated: "During the Allied Council for Japan, when the Soviet representative, Derevyanko, proposed revising Japan's labor laws, the American representative, Acheson, said: 'We should not teach Japan communism. On the contrary, we should teach them democratic principles. Neither communism nor fascism should lead trade unions.'" According to Reuters, Mr. Acheson gave us the impression that he was the most conservative American at the time. The Soviet proposal only contained the very common demands of the 20th century: guaranteeing freedom of trade unions, collective wage agreements, eight-hour workdays, healthcare, etc. The British representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Bower, said, "He saw no communist propaganda in the Soviet documents." The difference between Acheson and Bower is precisely the difference between the 17th and 20th centuries. Acheson seems to have slept for over two hundred years; he is unaware that Soviet trade unions played the most important role in anti-fascism." (Note: The title of this article quotes the story "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" by American writer Mark Twain, (in which Twain transformed Americans of his time into people of the Middle Ages).)
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 17th: Tokyo dispatch: The Soviet representative's proposals for formulating a Japanese labor program, submitted to the Allied Council for Japan on the 8th, included: (1) Expanding Japanese workers' welfare in the labor law. (2) Implementing labor management attempts if employers do not pay severance pay after closing factories. (3) Employers bear the financial responsibility for collective agreements. (4) Trade unions and labor negotiate industry-wide minimum wage agreements. (5) Equal pay for men and women for equally skilled workers. (6) An eight-hour workday, with a forty-eight-hour workweek. (7) Reducing working hours in hazardous industrial sectors. (8) Lawfully processed wages should have wages increased proportionally. (9) The current Japanese labor law stipulates two days of vacation per month, which should be changed to weekly vacations, as is the practice in other democratic countries. Additionally, two weeks of paid vacation should be given annually. (10) Medical insurance funds should be managed by trade unions. (11) No employment of young workers under the age of eighteen, and child labor should be prohibited. (12) Pregnant women should receive thirty-five days of leave with full pay. (13) Female workers should be prohibited from underground work in mines, etc.
    When the Soviet representative presented this proposal to the Allied Council for Japan, the American representative, Acheson, said, "This is communist propaganda." On the 16th, the Soviet representative, Derevyanko, refuted this while hosting British and American reporters, saying, "The Soviet proposal actually contains things that already exist in the labor laws of countries such as Britain and France, and even in the United States."

### 艾契森污蔑苏对日建议  真理报著文斥责  英代表亦认苏联建议合理

　　艾契森污蔑苏对日建议
    真理报著文斥责
    英代表亦认苏联建议合理
    【新华社延安十九日电】苏联真理报发表了萨斯拉夫斯基题为《阿瑟王在美国的巨仆》一文称：在对日委员会上，当苏联代表德勒维扬哥提出修改日本劳工法案的建议时，美代表艾契森说：“我们不应教诲日本以共产主义，相反的，我们应当教诲以民主的原则，无论共产主义或法西斯主义，都没有领导职工会”。据路透社称：艾契森先生给我们的印象，就是他是那时业为保守的美国人。苏联的建议只会有十分普遍的二十世纪的要求，保证职工会自由，集体协议工资，八小时工作，保健等。盟国对日委员会中的英国代表鲍尔说：“他在苏方的文件中，看不到任何共产党的宣传”。艾契森与鲍尔的区别，正是十七世纪与廿世纪间的区别。艾契森似乎睡了二百余年，他不知道苏联职工会在反法西斯主义中曾起了最重要的作用。（按：此文标题系引用美文学家马克德慧所著的《阿瑟王朝的美国人》的故事，（马氏在那本小说中，把当时的美国人转变成中古时代的人）。
    【新华社延安十七日电】东京讯：苏联代表于八日在对日委员会所提制定日本劳工纲领的建议，包括：（１）劳工法中应扩展日本工人福利。（２）如果雇主在工厂停闭之后不发解雇费，得实行劳工管理企图。（３）雇主担负集体协议的财政责任。（４）由工会与劳工协议工业的最低工资协定。（５）同样熟练的工人，男女同酬。（６）八小时工作日，每周工作四十八小时。（７）有危险性的企业部门，应减低工时。（８）合法加工的工资，按比例增加工资。（９）日本现行劳工法每月休假两天的规定，改为按其他民主国家之贯例，每周休假。另外每年放假两星期，工资照发。（１０）医药保险基金由工会管理。（１１）不得雇用十八岁以下之青工，并禁止雇用童工。（１２）孕妇休假三十五日，工资照发。（１３）在矿山等地下工作，禁用女工。
    苏联代表将此建议于对日委员提出时，美代表艾契森曾说：“这是宣传共产主义”。十六日苏代表德勒维扬哥在招待英美记者时予以反驳道：“苏联的建议，其实是在英、法等国家，甚至在美国的劳工法中早已有了的东西”。
