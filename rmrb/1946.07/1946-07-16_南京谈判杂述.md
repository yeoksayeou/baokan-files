Miscellaneous Notes on the Nanjing Negotiations
    Fan Changjiang
    The Nanjing negotiations came to a temporary, unfinished end on June 30th. Peng Xuepei, the Minister of Propaganda for the Kuomintang, issued a special announcement, illustrating the special process of the Nanjing negotiations and indicating the official attitude toward the future development of the situation.

    During the fifteen days of ceasefire negotiations and the eight days of extended ceasefire negotiations, the mood of the nation could be described as extremely tense, because these limited-term negotiations portended a major crisis: if an agreement couldn't be reached within the "deadline," the situation might deteriorate. The civil war, which the entire nation abhorred, would descend upon the broad masses of the people. Throughout the negotiations, the political representatives of various parties, except for warmongers, engaged in intense activities and hard work in Nanjing, reflecting the sentiments of the vast populace. The fluctuating U.S. foreign policy toward China was also closely linked to the Nanjing negotiations.

    The Nanjing negotiations, which began with Chiang Kai-shek's June 6th order for a ceasefire in the Northeast, were not a symbol of improved situation since the return of the Kuomintang government to the capital. Instead, they were another form of expression of the reversed situation since the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee in February of this year. The warmongers within the Kuomintang needed these negotiations to achieve certain unreasonable political and military goals, rather than genuinely seeking peace. Therefore, despite the sufficient concessions made by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the efforts of the third parties to mediate, and the petitions from the people, the negotiations still failed to produce results.

    While the demand for a halt to the civil war in the Northeast was the desire of the entire nation and had a powerful influence on the authorities' attitude, the warmongers' suspension of the civil war in the Northeast was directly determined by the military situation there. If the Northeast had consistently maintained the situation of June 20th to 25th, when the Democratic Allied Army withdrew from Sipingjie and Changchun, and if five full regiments had not been annihilated by the Democratic Allied Army after June 25th (not counting the sporadic ones), and if the Yunnan army under Commander Pan Shuoduan had not staged an anti-civil war uprising, there would have been no ceasefire in the Northeast. To stabilize the deteriorating military situation in the Northeast and to take advantage of the people's desire for peace, they used the "Northeast ceasefire" as a smokescreen, hoping to gain greater political and military advantages through negotiations within a short deadline, thereby securing a more favorable position for future civil war.

    Only in this way can one understand the meaning of General Xiong Shihui's statement that "negotiations are not a matter of failure or success, but merely a matter of the method of taking over."

    Since the warmongers were not seeking peace through negotiations, the spirit of the entire twenty-three-day negotiation became increasingly distant.

    First of all, these negotiations were not conducted in a spirit of consultation. Unilateral orders replaced harmonious discussions, and the negotiations were unilaterally "limited." The CCP and the people of the whole country were negotiating under extreme "threat," because everyone assumed that if an agreement could not be reached within the "deadline," a large-scale civil war would break out. If the Communist Party, other democratic parties, and the people of the whole country were afraid of civil war, they would have to accept the unreasonable demands of the warmongers within the "deadline," so that they could achieve their goals "peacefully."

    Secondly, the content of the negotiations was also unilaterally specified. This time, only military matters were discussed, not politics. The so-called "military matters" were the unilateral strategic demands of the warmongers. "Northeast ceasefire" meant continuing "taking over," and "restoring traffic" meant completely controlling the Jinpu, Jiaoji, and other railways. "Troop reorganization" meant handing over at least Subei, Rehe, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and other places. This was not only a military retreat but also a political retreat, and local political power could not be preserved. If these goals were achieved peacefully, the arrogance of the warmongers would be even greater, and the crisis of civil war would be even more severe.

    The most disheartening move in the negotiations was the issue of "final decision-making power." The warmongers openly advocated handing over the final decision-making power over China's internal affairs to the Americans, hoping to win the support of American imperialist elements. After the CCP sternly rejected this, the Kuomintang authorities insisted repeatedly, not only verbally but also openly in the negotiation documents. This was a rare precedent in Chinese history. Later, the Kuomintang authorities realized that they were in the wrong and deliberately claimed in their propaganda that it was "arbitration power" and "public power," but they did not change it during the negotiations.

    General Zhou Enlai issued a statement, expressing his desire for a long-term and comprehensive ceasefire, and pointed out that the fifteen-day deadline was too short, because negotiations would inevitably involve political issues in the Northeast and even the whole country, but he still welcomed these ceasefire negotiations. However, the Kuomintang newspapers said that this was deliberately involving too much, making the problem difficult to solve, and that it was "lack of sincerity." On the 9th, General Zhou Enlai returned from Yan'an and conducted negotiations "on the matter itself" to accommodate the Kuomintang's designated negotiations, but they said that this was "deliberately delaying." The CCP did not agree to hand over the final decision-making power to foreigners. They clamored from all sides that "the CCP is anti-American." In short, they were not looking for a compromise, but deliberately creating divisions.

    The CCP continuously made huge concessions in the negotiations. First, it discussed military affairs, not just military affairs without discussing politics, which was inconsistent with the CCP's, other democratic parties', and the people of the whole country's proposition of parallel military and political solutions. Regarding "restoring traffic," the CCP had also made principled concessions on the two points of comprehensively restoring traffic and comprehensively clearing bunkers, and agreed to first restore the Jinpu, Jiaoji, and Longhai railways in the liberated areas. Regarding "leveling bunkers," it agreed to the government's great reservation. Regarding the "troop reorganization" issue, the CCP adhered to the March 25th "troop reorganization" plan and also made sufficient concessions. Regarding the "final decision-making power" issue, although the CCP did not agree in principle, it agreed to give the American representatives greater convenience in several specific problem-solving groups. However, these concessions did not make the negotiations successful, because the warmongers' goal was to discuss controlling the most important strategic areas and transportation routes inside and outside the customs, in order to create a favorable situation for future civil war. Of course, they were unwilling to give up if their goal was not achieved.

    As the fifteen-day negotiations were about to end, the news of continued U.S. military aid to China on June 19th gave the warmongers great encouragement. As the negotiations were about to end, several statements from the U.S. State Department, toward the Chinese warmongering faction Kuomintang, the current propaganda center—the statement of CCP Central Committee Chairman Mao Zedong regarding U.S. policy toward China, stirred up American antipathy toward the CCP, making the imperialist elements in the U.S. government even more supportive of the warmongering faction. During the negotiation period, repeated emphasis on the CCP's attack on Qingdao also served this purpose.

    The Xiaguan Massacre on the 23rd showed the warmongers' determination, ruthlessly attacking the Shanghai people's peace petition representatives. Everyone knew that it was not an accidental act by "refugees," but a long-term, meticulous organization and leadership and a planned action. This happened on the first day of the eight-day ceasefire negotiations, which showed the warmongers' attitude toward the extended ceasefire. Therefore, although there were some agreements in the eight-day negotiations, they could not be signed, and this was the reason.

    Peng Xuepei's announcement on the 30th was produced under such a "contradictory" situation: On the one hand, the twenty-three days of "peaceful offensive" only further exposed the warmongers' intentions and did not achieve their expected goals. However, the warmongers were not deadhearted. Therefore, high-ranking warmongers and the warmongering faction overwhelmed everything. Many people advocated openly ordering a crusade, but on the other hand, the strength of the anti-civil war forces and the warmongering faction's own economic difficulties, as well as concerns about international conditions, forced the warmongering faction to have some concerns and leave room for maneuver. This formed a situation of "fighting while negotiating," and the excuses for fighting would vary from place to place. Some would say "self-defense," some would say "restoring traffic," and some would say "protecting the lives and property of the people." This is the reason why the military situation in the liberated areas of the Central Plains, Subei, and Shandong became increasingly urgent before and after Peng Xuepei's announcement.

　　南京谈判杂述
    范长江
    南京谈判到六月三十日暂时告一未结束的结束了。国民党中宣部长彭学沛特殊形式的公告，说明了南京谈判的特殊过程，而且说明着今后时局发展中官方的态度。
    在十五天的休战谈判和八天的延期休战谈判中，全国人民的心情可以说都紧张到了极点，因为这一有限期的谈判，预期着很大的危机，就是万一在“限期”内谈不好，时局就可能恶化下来。全国人所一致憎恶的内战就会驾临广大人民的头上。在谈判中，除好战分子外，各党派的政治代表人物在南京的紧张活动辛苦工作，就是广大人民心里的反应。美国对华外交政策的一张一弛，也与南京谈判息息相关。
    蒋介石六月六日所发布的东北停战命令所开始的南京谈判，并不是国民党政府还都以来时局好转的象征，而是今年二月国民党二中全会后逆转了的局势之另一形式的表现。国民党内好战分子需要这一谈判来达成一定的无理的政治军事目的，而不在真正谋及和平，所以不论中共作了足够的让步，第三方面尽力调处，人民纷纷请愿，仍然使谈判不能有结果。
    要求停止东北内战虽然是全国人民的要求，而且也有力的影响着当局的态度；而好战派之所以暂停东北内战，则直接由于东北军事形势所决定，如果东北始终保持六月二十日至二十五日民主联军由四平街长春撤退时的情况，没有二十五日以后五个整团被民主联军歼灭（零星的还不算），以及云南军队潘朔端师长的反内战起义等，那就不会有东北休战。为了稳定开始转入不利的东北军事形势，同时为了利用人民和平的愿望，所以用“东北休战”的烟幕，在短短的限期内希望用谈判方式来取得更大的政治军事利益，以为以后的内战取得更有利的阵地。
    只有这样才能懂得熊式辉将军所谓“谈判没有失败与成功问题，而只是接收方式问题”的意义。
    好战分子不是以谈判谋和平，所以贯穿整个二十三天谈判，精神上愈谈愈远。
    首先这次谈判就不是协商精神来进行的，单方面的命令代替了和谐的商谈，谈判也单方面“限期”。中共和全国人民在极大的“威胁”下来进行谈判，因为谁都会设想：如果在“限期”内不能达成协议，就会爆发大规模内战，如果共产党、其他民主党派和全国人民怕内战，就只有在“限期”内接受好战派的无理要求，这样他们就可以“和平”的达到目的。
    其次谈判内容也是单独指定的。此次不谈政治只谈军事，而所谓“军事”乃是好战分子单方面的战略要求，“东北停战”则系继续“接收”，“恢复交通”以全部控制津浦、胶济等铁路。“整军”则系至少交出苏北、热河、威海卫、烟台等地。这不但是军事的撤退，而且是政治的撤退，地方政权也不能保全。这一些目的如果和平达到之后，好战分子的气焰将更加高涨，内战危机将更巨大。
    在谈判中最令人寒心的一着，即“最后决定权”问题。好战分子，公开主张将中国内政的最后决定权交给美国人，想以此来争取美国帝国主义分子的支持。经中共严正拒绝之后，国民党当局们坚持再三，不仅出之于口，而且公然载之于谈判文件，此实为中国历史上稀有之先例。国民党当局以后自知理屈，在宣传上故意说是“仲裁权”与“公务权”等，但在谈判中并未变更。
    周恩来将军发表谈话，申明长期和全面停战之愿望，并指出十五天限期过短，因为谈判时必然涉及东北乃至全国的政治问题，但仍欢迎这休战谈判。而国民党报纸却又说这是故意牵连太广，使问题不易解决，说这是“无诚意”。九日周恩来将军由延安回来，“就事论事”来进行谈判，以迁就国民党之指定式谈判，则又说是“有意拖延”。中共不同意把最后决定权交给外国人。他们从各方面喧嚷“中共反美”，总之他们不是在找寻妥协点，而是故意制造分歧点。
    中共在谈判中不断作巨大让步，首先是商谈军事，不是只谈军事不谈政治，不合于中共、各民主党派与全国人民军事政治平行解决之主张，以“恢复交通”而言，中共也在全面恢复交通和全面清除碉堡这两点已作原则上让步，而同意首先恢复解放区内的津浦、胶济和陇海三铁路。“平毁碉堡”，同意政府方面之极大之保留。关于“整军”问题，中共坚持三月二十五日“整军”方案，并也做了足够的让步。关于“最后决定权”问题，中共在原则上虽不同意，但同意在若干具体问题执行小组中给美方代表以较大之便利。然而这些让步并未能使谈判成功，因为好战分子之目的在谈控制关内外最重要的战略地区与交通要道，以造成以后内战的有利形势，目的不达当然不甘心。
    十五天谈判将要结束时，六月十九日美国继续军事援华的消息，给好战派以很大的鼓励。谈判将结束时，美国国务院的几次声明，对于中国好战分子国民党，目前宣传中心——中共中央主席毛泽东同志对于美国对华政策的声明，挑拨美国对中共的恶感，使美政府中帝国主义分子更加支援好战分子。谈判时期中，一再强调中共进攻青岛也是这一作用。
    二十三日的下关惨案，则说明好战分子的决心，对上海人民和平请愿代表无情的打击，谁也知道不是“难民”偶然的行为，而是有长期的周密的组织领导与有计划的行动，这是发生在八天休战谈判的第一日，这是说明好战分子对延期休战的态度，因此八天谈判虽有些协议，但不能签字也就是这个道理。
    三十日彭学沛的公告是这样“矛盾”情形下产生的：一方面二十三天的“和平进攻”，只有更加暴露了好战分子的企图，而没有达到他们预期的目的。然而好战分子总不死心的，因此高级好战分子与好战派压倒一切，不少人主张公开下令讨伐，但是另一方面反内战力量之强大与好战派本身经济的困难，以及国际条件之顾虑，使好战派不能不有所顾虑，不能不留辗转余地，这就形成“边谈边打”的局面，而打的借口将因地而不同。有些将说“自卫”，有些将说“恢复交通”，有些将说“保护人民生命财产”，这就是彭学沛公告之前后，中原、苏北、山东等解放区军事情势日益紧急的原因。
