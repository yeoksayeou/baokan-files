Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: The entire faculty and staff of the Central Party School in Yan'an are now progressively and deeply studying the "Seventh National Congress" passed Constitution of the Communist Party of China. The school began on June 12th, divided into three stages: preliminary study, sectional study and research, and summary. The entire process will take approximately three to four months. The initial two-week preliminary study has concluded, and the study of the General Program is now proceeding in sections. Comrade Hou Weiyu, Deputy Director of the Academic Affairs Office, in a report on "How to Study the Party Constitution," pointed out the following learning methods: (1) Think more. It is necessary to consciously and actively think, using one's own mental labor to create one's own intellectual achievements. He pointed out that some comrades in the past had the following erroneous ideas when applying this point: only thinking about the small, not the big; only thinking about oneself, not the Party's policies; only thinking about the future, not the present; only thinking about one's own strengths, not one's own weaknesses; only thinking about other people's weaknesses, not other people's strengths; only thinking about achieving the goal, not the specific process; only thinking about smoothness, not difficulties... Such ideas should be corrected and replaced with ideas of "starting from reality," "starting from the masses," and "synthesis and analysis." (2) Freely mobilize one's own thinking, speak out about personal problems that exist and seek solutions, but at the same time, prevent only talking about others and not oneself, or only caring about oneself and not others, only knowing free thought and not knowing how to solve problems.” (3) The mass line in learning, seeking consensus through collective discussion, but discussions should have a humble attitude, be realistic, be kind to others, and believe in the power of everyone. (4) Uphold the truth and correct mistakes. Everyone is required to humbly listen to the opinions of others when upholding the truth, correct their own mistakes, and correct tendencies such as speaking and being done with it, neither persisting nor correcting, and not correcting after speaking out. (5) Interwoven throughout the above four learning methods is one method: self-criticism.
    During the two-week preliminary study, all faculty and staff members preliminarily browsed the Party Constitution, conducted self-examination in relation to themselves, and raised their own ideological problems. Therefore, the two-week preliminary study has enabled the leadership and each other to gain understanding, and everyone has clearly understood the purpose of studying the Party Constitution, overcoming all tendencies of unease and disconnection from thinking. On June 24th, the Party School conducted a summary report on the preliminary study phase. The current summary part of the study has begun, and it has been decided to complete it in three weeks. Everyone is now entering the stage of careful reading.

　　延安中央党校
    深入学习新党章
    侯维煜同志指出五点学习方法
    【新华社延安四日电】：中央党校全体学工人员，现在逐步深入学习“七大”通过之中国共产党党章。该校自六月十二日开始，分为初学、分学研究及总结三个步骤，全部时间约三、四个月。初学两周已告结束，现正相继分段研究总纲。教务处副主任侯维煜同志，于报告“怎样学习党章”中关于学习方法指出：（一）多想，必须自觉的主动的去想，以自己的思想劳动创造自己的思想成果，并指出过去有些同志在运用此点时，却有如下错误的想法，如只想小的，不想大的，只想自己不想党的政策，只想将来，不想现在，只想自己的优点，不想自己的缺点，只想人家的缺点，不想人家的优点，只想达到目的，不想具体过程，只想顺利，不想困难……此种想法应予纠正，而代之以“从实际出发”，“从群众出发”，“综合与分析”的想法。（二）放手发动自己思想，讲出个人存在的问题并求得解决，但同时须防止只讲别人不讲自己，或只管自己不管别人只知自由思想不知解决问题。”（三）学习上的群众路线，经过集体讨论求得认识一致，但讨论中要有虚心的态度，实事求是，与人为善，相信大家的力量。（四）坚持真理，修正错误。要求大家在坚持真理时，虚心听取别人的意见，纠正自己的错误，纠正说了完事、不坚持也不修正、说出后就不纠正等偏向。（五）在上述四种学习方法中，贯串着一个方法，就是自我批评。
    在初学两周中，全体学工人员初步浏览了党章，，联系自己进行检讨，并各自提出思想上存在的问题，因此两周的初学已使领导上及相互间取得了解，每个人已明确了解了学习党章的目的，克服了一切不安心及不联系思想的偏向。六月二十四日党校将初学阶段进行了总结报告，现总结部分学习已开始，决定三周完成，现在全体均进入精读阶段。
