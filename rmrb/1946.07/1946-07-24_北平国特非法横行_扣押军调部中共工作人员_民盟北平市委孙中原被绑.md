Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, July 17th (Delayed Dispatch) Yesterday in Peiping, Kuomintang secret service agencies illegally detained and inspected Communist personnel of the Military Mediation Executive Headquarters arriving in Peiping from Zhangjiakou, as well as their luggage. General Luo Ruiqing, Chief of Staff of the Communist side of the Military Mediation Department, along with several members of the department's Communist staff, returned to Peiping yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM on a Military Mediation Department plane from Zhangjiakou. At 6:30 PM, when their luggage vehicles passed through the West Zhimen area from the West Suburb Airport, Kuomintang military police guarding the gate swarmed onto the vehicles and forcibly inspected them. They then detained the luggage vehicles and escorting personnel in a red-painted doorway with no markings on Jingshan East Street, and the escorting personnel and luggage were further searched by multiple Kuomintang armed plainclothes agents and soldiers. Upon hearing the news, the Communist side of the Military Mediation Department immediately dispatched Colonel Gao Tang and others to negotiate. When Gao Tang arrived at the secret agency, the plainclothes armed personnel not only stubbornly refused to release the detained personnel and luggage vehicles and refused to explain the name and system of the agency but also forcibly searched Gao Tang's body. As of the time of this dispatch, the detained escorting personnel and luggage vehicles were still being held. It is reported that the Communist representative of the Military Mediation Department has lodged a serious protest with the Kuomintang authorities regarding this matter.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 20th—Peiping Dispatch: Following the tragic assassinations of Mr. Wen Yiduo and Mr. Li Gongpu, members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, in Kunming, Mr. Sun Zhongyuan of the Peiping Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League was also kidnapped by Kuomintang secret agents the day before yesterday, and his life or death remains unknown. Zhang Dongsun and Liu Qingyang, responsible persons of the China Democratic League in North China, jointly sent a letter to the Peiping Municipal Authorities yesterday, lodging a serious protest and demanding the immediate release of Mr. Sun. Mr. Sun was on his way out at 4:00 PM on the 18th when he was suddenly followed by several Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in three cars while passing through Nanchizi Street in Peiping. They dragged him into a car and calmly drove away. Nanchizi Street is a busy area, and the incident occurred in broad daylight, but the local military police turned a blind eye to the atrocities of the secret agents. The kidnapping of Mr. Sun is the beginning of Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agencies' plan to assassinate national democratic figures in Peiping. The kidnapping of Mr. Sun is the third incident of democratic league members being harmed by secret agents in a week.

　　北平国特非法横行
    扣押军调部中共工作人员
    民盟北平市委孙中原被绑
    【新华社北平十七日电】（迟到）平市昨日发生国民党特务机关非法扣押检查由张家口抵平之军调执行部中共人员及行李事件。军调部中共参谋长罗瑞卿将军暨该部中共工作人员数人，于昨日下午六时由张垣搭乘军调部飞机返抵平市，六时三十分，当彼等之行李车辆由西郊机场经西直门等，守门国民党宪兵即蜂拥登车，强行检查，并随将行李车辆及押车人员一并押至景山东大街一座并无任何标帜之红漆大门屋内，拘禁押车人员身体及行李，又遭国民党武装便衣与军人多人之再度搜查。军调部中共方面闻讯：即派高棠上校等前往交涉，高等抵达该秘密机关时，该便衣武装等不仅蛮横拒释被扣人员及行李车辆，拒绝说明该机关名称及系统，且对高等又强予全身搜查。迄发电时止，被扣押车人员及行李车辆犹在拘押中。闻军调部中共代表为此已向国民党当局提出严重抗议。
    【新华社延安二十日电】北平讯：继民盟中委闻一多、李公朴二氏在昆明惨遭暗杀后，民盟北平市委孙中原氏前日亦被国民党特务绑架而去，至今生死不明。华北民盟负责人张东荪，刘清扬等已于昨日联名函致北平市当局，提出严重抗议，要求立即释放孙氏。孙氏系于十八日下午四时因事外出，行经平市南池子街时，突遇蒋记特务数人乘汽车三辆追踪而至，将其架上车子从容而逸。南池子街地处热闹，且时在白昼，但当地军警对特务暴行视若未睹。此次孙氏被绑，系蒋介石特务机关暗杀全国民主人士计划在平实行之开端。孙氏被绑为一周以来民主同盟人士遭受特务残害的第三事件。
