　　Poetry and Music
    Guo Moruo
    All the sounds of nature—wind, rain, water, waves, beasts, birds, even the sound of flowers blooming and falling—have a certain cadence. The consciousness expressed by humans before language existed, the chaotic cries, shouts, laughter, and sobs, were all naturally formed sounds. These should be the earliest forms of music, or the solidified form of music. When humans discovered the patterns in natural music, scales and musical laws were born. With the reasonable composition of musical laws, music grew even further.

    After the invention of human language, a type of music containing clear consciousness appeared: poetry. Poetry seems to be just a branch, or a "variant," of music. However, the musicality of language is limited, while the development of consciousness is unlimited. The music of consciousness surpasses the limitations of musical laws and grows. Thus, poetry gradually separated, and poetry and music gradually separated as well.

    As the growth and separation of both were simultaneously compelled by the further differentiation of society, poetry and music mistakenly embarked on the path of serving the powerful and wealthy. Technique was confined to the palace, while essence remained among the people. Technique was updated with the times, while essence remained eternal with the people. The lives of the people, the emotions of the people, the aspirations of the people, have always maintained the continuous mainstreams of poetry and music.

    For thirty years, the people have been calling for enriching the respective mainstreams of poetry and music, for uniting technique and essence, for them to serve the people entirely, to reflect the lives of the people, to express the emotions and aspirations of the people. After thirty years of dialectical development, "refined" and "vulgar," "new" and "old," "foreigners" and "natives" have gradually reached a point where they can become a new synthesis. The people are demanding new people's art, new national forms.

    Under this new demand, poetry and music should develop in a balanced way and maintain close ties, taking the consciousness of the people as their consciousness, and the rhythm of the people's emotions as their rhythm. Without rhythm, there can be no music; without rhythm, music cannot become poetry. This pair of flowing temporal arts should develop new life under the call of the Chinese people.

    We obey the call of the people. We want to create new music and new poetry, the great embrace of new music and new poetry, and the great embrace of all arts, to dedicate to our supreme master—the people. (Reprinted from the inaugural issue of Shanghai Poetry and Music Weekly)

　　诗歌与音乐
    郭沫若
    自然界的一切风声、雨声、水声、涛声、兽声、鸟声、甚至如花开花落的声响，都有一定的顿挫抑扬。人在未有语言时所发出的意识，混沌呼号叫笑也都是自成天籁。这些应该是最早的音乐，或音乐的固型。人到发现了自然音乐中的规律，于是便有音阶与音律产生，由于音律的合理组成，使音乐便更加成长。
    人类的语言发明之后，一种兼含着明确意识的音乐出现，她便是诗歌。诗歌对于音乐似乎只是一种分枝，或者“变种”。但语言的音律性有限制，而意识的发展性无限制，意识的音乐超过了音律的限制而成长。于是诗歌便逐渐分离，诗歌与音乐也逐渐分离了。
    随着两者的成长与分离同时更为社会的分化所强迫，诗歌与音乐都错误地走上了权贵奉仕的道路，技巧归诸宫庭，本质留在民间，技巧随着时代的翻新而翻新，本质随着人民的永在而永在。人民的生活，人民的感情，人民的愿望，始终保持着诗歌与音乐的不断的本流。
    三十年来人民在呼唤要把诗歌和音乐各自的本流充沛起来，要把技巧与本质合而为一，要他们整个地奉仕于人民，反映人民的生活，表达人民的感情人民的愿望。经过三十年的辩证的发展，“雅”与“俗”“新”与“旧”，“外来者”与“固有者”渐渐到了可以成为新的综合的时候了。人民在要求着新的人民艺术，新的民族形式。
    诗歌与音乐在这新的要求之下，平衡地发展而保持着密切的关联，要以人民的意识为意识，人民的感情的节奏为节奏。没有节奏不能成为音乐，没有节奏的音乐更不能成为诗歌。这一对流动的时间艺术，应该在中国人民的呼召之下，而发展着新的生命。
    我们服从着人民的呼召，我们要创造新音乐与新诗歌，新音乐与新诗歌的大合抱和一切艺术的大合抱，以奉献于我们至高无上的主--人民。（转载沪诗歌与音乐周刊创刊号）
