　　American Imperialist Elements
    Assist Chiang in Slaughtering the Chinese People
    Telegrams of Opposition from Various Places in Northeast China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 24th] (Delayed) The heinous actions of American imperialist elements in assisting the Kuomintang and reactionaries in slaughtering the Chinese people have aroused strong indignation among the people of Northeast China. In recent days, telegrams and appeals from various places have unanimously demanded that the United States promptly correct this erroneous behavior. The Harbin Public Associations Joint Committee stated in its telegram, after denouncing the erroneous actions of the American authorities in assisting Chiang to expand the civil war and attack and slaughter the people of Northeast China: "We have already defeated Japanese imperialism and have the valuable experience of winning the national self-defense war. If any imperialism comes to infringe upon our interests again, we will resolutely oppose it to the end." The Preparatory Committee of the Heilongjiang Provincial Cultural Federation appealed to the national press, publishing, and education circles to use all their strength to mobilize the people of the whole country to oppose the reactionary policy of American imperialist elements assisting Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people, and demanded the immediate withdrawal of American naval, land, and air forces stationed in China. Staff members and workers from thirty public and private primary and secondary schools in Qiqihar held a meeting, vowing to fight for the defense of peace and democracy with the determination of "rather die than not be liberated." They also warned American imperialist elements not to be enemies of the Chinese people and called on the education circles to unite to oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries' shameful acts of relying on the United States and betraying national sovereignty. When the cultural circles were to hold an emergency meeting on the 15th, a telegram was sent requesting the Kuomintang to immediately lay down their butcher knives and cease fire for a long time; and resolutely opposed the United States continuing to aid Chiang. The Nenjiang Provincial Buddhist representative ＠Guan Dou said at the Qiqihar Religious Red Cross meeting: "The Northeast Democratic Allied Army has made contributions in resisting Japan and has the right to defend the fruits of victory; the people of Northeast China have the right to carry out democratic autonomous construction," and announced that the Red Cross will work harder to rescue the wounded soldiers of the Democratic Allied Army who are defending peace. Mr. Pu Zhiping, a Northeast agricultural expert who studied in the United States in Qiqihar said: "If the United States continues this kind of imperialist behavior, the Chinese and American people will definitely unite and resolutely oppose it!"
