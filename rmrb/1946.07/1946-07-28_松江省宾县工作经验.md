　　Work Experience in Bin County, Songjiang Province

　　The mass work led by Ma Bin, Secretary of the Bin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Songjiang Province, Northeast China, has made Bin County one of the model counties in the Northeast. When Ma first arrived in Manjing, the masses were afraid of the armed forces of traitors and despots and dared not rise up boldly. In response to this situation, he mobilized the peasants to first disarm the traitors and despots, and organized peasant armed forces. Once the masses were armed, they boldly carried out the anti-traitor liquidation movement. Based on this experience, under the conditions in Northeast China where traitors and despots possessed large numbers of armed forces, in order to begin economic struggle, it was necessary to organize mass armed forces to disarm the reactionary armed forces, and then turn to in-depth economic and political struggle. When county-level organs were first established, some cadres felt that they could not manage the work of the organs and were unwilling to go to the countryside. Ma Bin handed over the work of the organs to the cadres and often went to the countryside to work himself. Some cadres, after going to the countryside, lived in the homes of grain-rich households, so that they could not get close to poor peasants. Ma Bin, after going to the countryside, lived in the homes of the poorest peasants, paying for food according to the grain and vegetable prices. He learned the language and living habits of the masses and discussed and led the rent reduction, anti-traitor, and liquidation movements with the peasants on the same kang (platform bed). Once, while working in the urban and rural areas, he discovered and organized a rent reduction movement because he lived in the home of a poor citizen. Last winter, when the poor people in the county town had no firewood to burn, he organized a firewood cutting team and personally led the poor people to cut firewood and hunt foxes in the mountains, and announced that the right to cut down trees in Zhanglin would be handed over to the Farmers and Workers' Union. Ma Bin is good at developing the enthusiasm of the masses. For example, when distributing accumulated grain in Manjing, he mobilized the masses to discuss and distribute it themselves. Ma Bin has such a mass viewpoint and mass style that he is unanimously loved by the people of the county. Last year, during the Lunar New Year, the masses from the four villages carried wild goats and other gifts to him in the icy and snowy weather. When he went to work in some unsafe areas, the masses automatically took turns on guard to protect him. He is an intellectual cadre who previously served as the secretary of the county party committee in Central China. Last November, he was appointed as the Minister of Mass Work of the Political Department of the Songjiang Military Region and engaged in mass work in the Bin County area with the army. Because of his close contact with the local masses, and because he requested to do grassroots work himself, he was appointed as the Secretary of the Bin County Party Committee. The Northeast Daily, the organ newspaper of the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, published an editorial praising him. The editorial introduced Ma Bin's mass work methods and style, calling on cadres in various places to learn from him.

　　Regarding the issue of leadership, cadre style, and work methods

　　During the opening up period of work in newly liberated areas, the difficulty for leaders was the lack of cadres and the lack of understanding of the situation. Therefore, leading comrades were required to go deep among the masses. However, all the work in the organs was urgent, so when it came to going down to work, they often felt that the work in the organs could not be left behind. Later, this weakness was overcome. Leading cadres arranged the work of the organs well and handed it over to the staff members left in the organs. When there were major problems, they returned to the organs or solved them by writing letters and making phone calls.

　　At the beginning of the work in Bin County, a problem was made, that is, mechanically moving certain experiences from the liberated areas, strictly dividing the work of each department, and failing to make every effort to do mass work. Later, after instructions from the sub-bureau, it was determined that the Party Committee was the same as the Ethnic Affairs Committee, and the Ethnic Affairs Committee was the same as the Agricultural Committee, and then this tendency was gradually overcome. At the same time, the focus was first placed on the work, and the basic mass of farmers and workers was organized.

　　In the method of mobilizing the masses, it is necessary to adopt the method of breaking through one point, training cadres, and expanding the area. At first, Bin County evenly distributed some old cadres to various districts, one in each district. As a result, the people sent were busy doing general mobilization work all day long and could not play a role in leading and organizing the masses to train cadres. After accepting this experience, it was adopted to temporarily abandon certain areas and concentrate cadres to work in one or two places first, such as first concentrating cadres to work in the Xucheng area, selecting two of the poorest villages, and organizing peasant associations in half a month through rent reduction and the calculation of corruption and allocation grain. The work here has made achievements, the leadership has gained experience, the activists have been mobilized and the cadres have been trained, and the nearby masses have been influenced. Therefore, while the iron was hot, a large number of activists were organized and distributed to open up neighboring areas, and new cadres were trained. In five days, a large struggle was carried out jointly in nearby areas. The "island offensive" method was also adopted in Juren Sanbao and other areas. That is, first select a large tribe, and convene the masses of nearby tribes to participate in the struggle meeting for visits, lectures, and study. After breaking through the large tribe, the small tribes will then be involved in the struggle and organized. During this period, in the absence of mass movements and mass struggles, it is necessary to combine large-scale detailed investigation and deliberation, visiting each household one by one, and understanding everything about each household. This requires a lot of time to explain the purpose, dispel misunderstandings, and repeat education, and it is not necessarily possible to cultivate activists. It is necessary to publicly call for anti-traitors on a large scale and encourage everyone to speak up at mass meetings. This makes it easy to discover general problems, and some activists will naturally emerge. Then it is necessary to carry out specific and detailed ideological education. At the beginning of mobilizing the masses, it is necessary to focus on the basic masses. Some cadres look for grain households to live in, on the grounds that there is a way to eat, and it is difficult for non-grain households to provide food. As a result, they are more close to grain households, less close to poor people, listen more to grain households, and know less about the suffering of poor people. Poor households are unwilling to go to the homes of grain households to find our cadres, and even if they do, they dare not say anything because the grain households are there. When cadres visit poor people's homes, the grain households follow behind, making it impossible for poor peasants to approach us. Later, a rule was made: "Cadres do not eat grain households' meals or live in grain households' houses when they go to the countryside. They only look for poor people to live and eat with, and give them grain and vegetable money." When holding meetings, only individual deliberations with basic workers and peasant masses should be convened. During education, they should personally live in poor people's homes, so that they can have in-depth talks with basic masses and activists at any time. At the same time, the ultra-poor proletariat and semi-proletariat in Bin County are most eager to improve their lives and are the most combative masses. It is necessary to first mobilize them to lead the struggle, so it is necessary to first understand their demands and first launch economic struggles related to them. It is right to use rent reduction to mobilize the masses, but it is necessary to look at the specific situation. Some comrades memorize this point by rote, and when they arrive in a village, they only look for tenant farmers, without asking whether the tenant farmers in this village are middle peasants or rich peasants. Under such circumstances, there will be no large mass movement. Therefore, it is necessary to first clarify the demands of the ultra-poor households, such as anti-traitor liquidation, rent reduction, although the ultra-poor have no land, but the houses they live in must reduce rent, calculate corruption accounts, calculate forced labor accounts, etc., only in this way can the ultra-poor mobilize and launch the movement.

　　How to deal with the sabotage of reactionary elements

　　Reactionary elements are most afraid of the masses rising up and hate the newly emerging local cadres the most. When the masses turned themselves over, they did not talk about someone's smoking or gambling, but when the poor rose up to settle accounts, they went to the masses and said that this person smoked opium, or that person gambled, in order to attack the masses. Therefore, on the one hand, we must expose the conspiracy of these reactionary elements, and at the same time, we must be vigilant that all cadres and members of the Farmers and Workers' Union must not violate anything, so as not to give reactionary elements an excuse. The Farmers' Association and the Self-Defense Forces must understand such covenants. (1) Do not allow the following people to be members or team members: (1) Traitors, puppet officials, police, lackeys. (2) Bandits, soldiers, petty thieves. (3) Those who smoke opium, smoke white powder, or inject morphine. (4) Those who do not farm or work. (2) Members and team members must not gamble, smoke opium, prostitute, or engage in small labor.

　　Reactionary elements not only look for faults in the cadres of the Farmers and Workers' Union, but also try their best to create these faults in order to frame them. They invite the cadres to their homes and say again and again: "You have worked hard, you are really capable," and they must kill a chicken and prepare two pots of wine. But after eating, he spread the word everywhere saying: "A certain director or captain has a good capacity for alcohol and likes to eat chicken." At this time, the cadre has been fooled. The grain households in the Binwan area sent money to the cadres batch after batch, and also sent opium pipes. The cadres did not accept them, so they sent them to the cadres' children. At the Farmers and Workers' Congress, everyone unanimously recognized this conspiracy, believing that this was their means of bribing cadres. Many people said: "Why didn't you invite us before, but now you invite us? Why doesn't he give a little to the 'beggars' who pass by the door, but invites us with big wine and meat? These are all fake." So everyone made a rule: "Do not accept any gifts, do not live in their houses, do not eat their meals." At the training class in the Chengxiang area, members of the Farmers and Workers' Union shouted out several slogans: "Cannot be scared!" "Cannot be bought!" These slogans were accepted and remembered by all members of the county.

　　In places where the county has not sent cadres to work, reactionary elements, in order to deal with the Farmers and Workers' Union, push some people out to establish fake farmers' associations, put a large number of armed forces under the name of the People's Self-Defense Forces, and carry out some struggles to "drop head" rich peasants but not traitors. There are also some rogue thieves who secretly extort and strangle people under false pretenses, which has caused social dissatisfaction. Therefore, when our cadres went there, they first launched to organize the basic masses, topple the fake Workers' and Peasants' Unions and fake Self-Defense Forces, and at the same time oppose some bad guys who oppressed the people under false pretenses.

　　Issue of reforming the regime

　　Generally speaking, there are several ways to transform the regime: one is to send people to take over and replace the old with the new; one is to educate, adjust, and transform; and the other is to mobilize the masses, generate cadres from the masses, and transform and enrich the regime. According to experience, these three methods are mutually used at the beginning. Generally, the superior responsible person sends people to take over, and the staff of the organs are educated and transformed. As for administrative cadres in districts and villages, it is not good to send them. Only by mobilizing the masses to thoroughly transform can we talk about administrative transformation.

　　When the masses have not been mobilized, it is best not to send outside cadres to be administrative cadres. Because sending one or two outside cadres to work at this time will not do a good job, but will cause dissatisfaction among the masses. At this time, the masses should first be mobilized and organized. When the masses are armed, the Self-Defense Forces will in fact become the most powerful organ. This organ is generated from the people, serves the people, is supported by the people, and is the organ of power. At this time, the masses will transform those who can be transformed among the old regime personnel, and the masses will not want those who cannot be transformed.

　　On the issue of organizing mass armed forces

　　A very serious problem exists in the villages of Bin County, that is, traitors, spies, and certain reactionary landlords collude to oppress the people. Reactionary forces control the armed forces, our troops are stationed on the move, and the peasants have no weapons, so they cannot boldly fight against the reactionary forces. The masses' rent reduction, interest reduction, wage increase, and anti-traitor movements cannot be carried out smoothly and in depth and extensively. Therefore, in order to ensure the smooth development of the mass movement, it is necessary to disarm the reactionary forces. Only when the peasants arm themselves can they dare to fight against the armed reactionary forces and carry out in-depth economic and political struggles. This is called using armed peasants to oppose armed reactionary forces.

　　This is how the masses were mobilized in Manjing Village.

　　With the help of the external force of the troops, the main bandits were dispersed, and the guns controlled by the reactionary forces were distributed to the peasants. The civilian affairs cadres of the troops carried out relief movements and distributed the enemy's property. In this way, part of the masses were mobilized in three to five days, and activists were discovered. Seize the opportunity to continuously educate the peasants to understand the importance of armed forces, to take down the guns of the reactionary forces, so that we poor people can have the strength and no longer be oppressed.

　　The masses began to feel lonely and actively sought to combine with other poor people. Later, the armed forces increased and the People's Self-Defense Forces were established.

　　At this time, the government issued a proclamation stipulating that local landlords should hand in their guns and inspect them, and the People's Self-Defense Forces would implement it. At this time, everything was handed over to the People's Self-Defense Forces. The Self-Defense Forces sheltered the cadres of the Farmers' Association, and the cadres of the Farmers' Association also had their own guns. The Farmers' Association and the Self-Defense Forces became the most powerful organs in the locality. Because they are not only their own organizations of the broad masses, but also have the strength of armed self-defense.

　　After such a struggle in Manjing Village, it is possible to go out to work within ten or twenty miles nearby. Having the Self-Defense Forces to cover them is one aspect. On the other hand, the reactionary forces have lost their guns, and the peasants dare to go deep into reducing rent. The peasants said: "Even guns have to come out, how can we not dare to reduce rent!"

　　In the Northeast, under the circumstances where reactionary elements have armed forces, mobilizing the masses generally goes through the following steps: that is, first carry out economic struggle, and in the struggle, immediately arm the activists and the masses to disarm the reactionary armed forces, and mobilize the masses to turn to in-depth economic and political struggle.

　　Armed forces that have not been mobilized by economic struggle, but have only been commissioned or issued guns by the troops, are generally unreliable. Because under such circumstances, the basic masses are not yet armed to protect their own vested interests; or they are thoroughly turning themselves over; at most, they are only for the requirements of preventing bandits and preventing bandits. The demands of the farmers and workers are not urgent, and as a result, their leadership may even be manipulated by reactionary landlords, becoming armed forces that hinder the mobilization of the masses.

　　On the other hand, it is also necessary to oppose the tendency to wait for widespread and in-depth struggle before arming the masses. In this way, it is not easy to mobilize the masses to carry out in-depth struggle, and it is not easy to launch the movement. It is necessary to disarm the reactionary elements in a timely manner, arm the activists and the masses who have risen up, in order to promote the masses' confidence in victory in the struggle for their own interests.

　　Today's peasant armed forces mostly adopt the organizational form of the People's Self-Defense Forces. The Self-Defense Forces are mostly actually led by the Farmers' Association. It is dangerous to use all guns in the unreformed village regime. It is also inappropriate to hand over the handling of guns to the unreformed regime.

　　松江省宾县工作经验
    东北松江省宾县中共县委书记马斌领导宾县的群众工作，成为东北的模范县之一。马氏至满井工作时，群众怕汉奸恶霸的武装不敢大胆的起来，他便根据这种情况，发动农民首先解除汉奸恶霸的武装，组织农民武装，群众有了武装即大胆进行反奸清算运动。由于得出经验，在东北汉奸恶霸拥有大批武装的条件下，开始进行经济斗争，就必须组织群众武装解除反动武装，然后再转入深入的经济和政治斗争。在县级机关初建立时，有些干部觉得机关工作摆不开不愿下乡，而马氏把机关工作放手交给干部去做，自己经常下乡工作。有些干部下乡后住在粮户家里，以致和贫苦农民不能接近；马氏下乡后则住在最穷苦的农民家里，吃饭照给粮食菜金，他学会了群众的语言和生活习惯，和农民在一个炕上商量和领导进行减租、反奸、清算等运动。一次他在城厢工作，因为住在贫苦市民家里，就发现与组织了减房租的运动。去年冬天，县城内贫民没有柴烧，他便组织砍柴队，亲自带领贫民到山上砍柴、打狐子，并宣布将枨林的砍伐权交给农工联合会。马氏善于发扬群众的积极性，如在满井分配积谷粮时，发动群众自己议、自己分。马氏有这样的群众观点和群众作风，一致得到全县人民的爱戴。去年过旧历年时，四乡群众在冰天雪地中担了野羊等送给他；当他去某些不很安全的地区工作时，群众自动的轮流放哨，加以保护。他系知识分子干部，过去曾在华中任县委书记，去年十一月到松江军区政治部任民运部长，随军在宾县一带进行群众工作，因与当地群众发生密切联系，本人又要求做下层工作，随被任为宾县县委书记，中共东北局机关报——东北日报曾发表社论加以表扬。社论中介绍马氏的群众工作方法和作风，号召各地干部向他学习。
            关于领导和干部作风与工作方法问题
    新解放区工作开辟时期，领导的困难是干部少，情况不了解。因而要求领导同志深入群众，但机关里一切工作都迫切要做，因而开始谈到下去工作，往往感到机关里工作丢不开，但后来克服了这个弱点。领导干部将机关工作布置好，放手交给留在机关里的工作人员，有重大问题时，再回机关或是用写信及电话解决。
    宾县工作开始曾犯了一种毛病，即是机械的搬某些解放区的经验，各部门严格分工，未能全力作群众工作，后经分局指示，确定党委即是民委，民委即是农委后，才逐渐克服了这个偏向。同时工作上首先抓住重心，组织了农工基本群众。
    在发动群众的方法上，必须采取突破一点，培养干部，扩展地区的方法。起初宾县把若干老干部平均分配到各区去，一区一个，结果派去的人整天忙着做一般动员工作，不能起领导与组织群众培养干部的作用。接受了这个经验，便采取了可使某些地区暂时丢开，而集中干部先在一两个地方工作，如先集中干部在戌城地区工作，选择了两个最穷的村子，在半个月内经过减租和算贪污算配给粮，组织了农会。这里工作既做出成绩领导上又取得了经验，又发动了积极分子和培养了干部，又影响了附近群众，因而乘热打铁便组织了大批积极分子，分布开辟邻近地区，又锻炼了新干部，五天工夫即附近区联合进行了大的斗争，在居仁三宝等地区也采取了“越岛进攻”的方法。即是先选择一个大部落，召集附近各部落群众参加斗争会。参观、听讲、学习。突破了大部落，小部落随之卷入斗争和组织起来。这期间在没有群众运动和群众斗争的情形下，必须采取大规模细密调查与酝酿相结合的方法，一家一家的访问，对各户什么都要了解，这样就必须用很多时间说明来意，打消误解，重复教育，而且不一定能培养出积极分子。必须大规模的公开号召反奸与发动在群众会议上大家争着讲话，这就容易发现一般问题，而且自然会出现一些积极分子。然后必须具体细密的进行思想教育。在发动群众开始必须着重基本群众，有些干部住房子找粮户，理由是吃饭有办法，无粮户供饭困难，结果是多接近粮户，少接近穷人，多听粮户的话，少知穷人的痛苦。穷户不愿到粮户家里找我们的干部，便去找也因有粮户在什么话也不敢说。干部到穷人家访问时，粮户跟在后边，因而使穷苦农民不敢接近我们。后来订了一条规则：“干部下乡不吃粮户饭，不住粮户房，专找穷人家住吃，给他们粮食菜金。”开会时应只召开农工基本群众个别酝酿，教育时应亲自住在穷苦人家，以便随时和基本群众与积极分子深谈。同时宾县赤贫无产阶级和半无产阶级，他们要求改善生活最迫切，是斗争性最强的群众，必须首先发动他们领导斗争，因而必须首先了解他们的要求，首先发动与他们有关的经济斗争。用减租来发动群众这是对的，但必须看具体情况。有的同志死记着这一条，到了一个村子只找租地佃户，而不问这个屯子的佃户是中农是富农。在这种情形下就不会有大的群众运动，因而必须首先清楚赤贫户的要求，如反奸清算，减房租，赤贫虽无地，但住的房子要减房租，算贪污帐，算勒工帐等，只有这样才能发动赤贫把运动开展起来。
            怎样对付反动分子的破坏
    反动分子最怕群众起来，最恨新起的地方干部。他们在群众翻身时，也不说某人吃烟耍赌的事，可是当穷人起来算帐的时候，他们却到群众中说这个人吸过大烟，或那个人耍过赌等，借以打击群众。因此，一方面要揭破这些反动分子的阴谋，同时警惕一切干部和农工会员不能违犯一点，以免反动分子借口，农会和自卫队要了解这样的公约。（１）不要下面这些人当会员或队员：（一）汉奸、伪吏、警察、狗腿。（二）胡匪、兵痞、小偷。（三）吸大烟、抽白面、扎吗啡的。（四）不种地也不做工的。（２）会员和队员不能耍赌和吸大烟、嫖窑子、拉套做小工。
    反动分子一方面专找农工会干部的毛病，实际上又千方百计地制造这些毛病，以便陷害。他们把干部请到家里再三说：“你辛苦了，真能干”，一定要杀个鸡弄两壶酒。但是吃过之后，他却到处宣传说：“某某主任或队长酒量不错，还喜欢吃小鸡，这时候干部已经上了当。宾完区的粮户送钱给干部一批又一批，还送大烟炮子，干部们都不收，他们又送给干部的小孩子。在农工代表大会上大家一致认清了他们的这种阴谋，认为这是他们收买干部的手段。许多人说：“为什么以前不请现在请呢？为什么要饭的‘乞丐’走门口过他不给一点，而大酒大肉请我们？这些都是假的。”于是大家又订出规矩：“不受任何礼物，不住他们房子，不吃他们饭。”反动分子用这些方法收买后又吓虎说道：“中央军吓了掉头！”大家又一致表示：“我们团结起来就有力量，无论他们怎样吓，也吓不倒我们。”城厢区训练班上，农工会员喊出几个口号：“吓不倒！”、“买不动！”这些口号为全县会员所接受与牢记。
    在县上未派干部去工作薄弱的地方，反动分子或为了对付农工会，便推一些人出来成立假农会，把大批武装安上人民自卫队的名字，进行了一些斗“掉头”富农不斗汉奸的斗争，也有一些流氓小偷假借名义偷偷的敲竹杠，勒脖子这些事情曾引起社会的不满。因而当我们的干部去了之后，便先发动去组织基本群众，把假工农会假自卫队斗倒，同时反对一些假借名义欺压民众的坏蛋。
            改造政权问题
    改造政权的方法，一般说有下面几种：一是派人接替，除旧换新：一是教育、调整、改造；还有一个是发动群众，从群众中产生干部改造和充实政权。这三种方法根据经验开始时相互运用，一般是上级负责人派人接替，机关职员教育改造。至于区村中这类行政干部，派去不好，只有发动群众彻底改造，群众发动起来之后，才能谈行政改造。
    在群众未发动起来时，最好不要派外来干部去做行政干部。因为这时候派一二个外来干部去工作也不会做好，反会引起群众不满，这时应首先让群众发动组织起来，群众武装也有了的时候，自卫队事实上成为最有势力的机关，这个机关从人民中产生，为人民服务，受人民拥护而又是权力机关。这时候对旧政权人员能改造者改造，不能改造的群众就不会要他。
            关于组织群众武装问题
    宾县各村群众存在着一个很严重的问题，即是汉奸、特务与某些反动地主结合鱼肉人民。反动势力掌握着武装，我们的部队流动驻防，农民手无寸铁，不能大胆与反动势力斗争，群众的减租减息、增加工资及反汉奸运动不能畅快深入和广泛的开展。因此，要使群众运动顺利开展，必须解除反动派武装。只有农民自己武装起来了，才敢进行反对有武装的反动势力的斗争，才能开展深入经济和政治斗争。这就叫做以武装农民，反对武装反动势力。
    满井村就是这样发动群众的。
    靠部队外力的帮助打散主要股匪，把反动势力掌握的枪枝发给农民，部队民运工作干部开展救济运动及分敌产工作，这样在三五天之内发动了部分群众，发现了积极分子，抓住机会不断教育农民了解武装的重要，要把反动势力的枪拿下来，我们穷人才能有力量，不再受欺压。
    群众开始感觉孤单，积极的寻找别的贫苦成分的人结合起来，后来武装就多起来了，便成立人民自卫队。
    这时候政府出布告规定地方地主交枪，验枪，人民自卫队执行，这时候把什么都交给人民自卫队办，自卫队掩护农会干部，农会干部自己也有枪枝，农会和自卫队成了地方上最有权力的机关。因为他们不仅是广大群众自己的组织，而且有武装自卫的力量。
    满井村经过这样的斗争，附近十里二十里都可出去工作。有自卫队掩护这是一方面，另方面反动势力没了枪，农民也就敢深入减租。农民说：“连枪都要出来了，租还不敢减！”
    在东北反动分子有武装的情况下，发动群众一般地经过这样几个步骤：即是首先进行经济斗争，在斗争中即时武装积极分子以及群众解除反动武装，发动群众转入深入的经济和政治斗争。
    没有经过经济斗争发动群众的，只由部队加委或发枪的武装，一般说是靠不住的。因为在这种情形下，基本群众还不是为保护自己已得利益；或者彻底翻身而武装起来，至多不过是为防匪面防匪的要求，在农工群众并不迫切，结果其领导甚至会操在反动地主手中，变成阻碍群众发动的武装。
    另一方面，也必须反对等待广泛深入斗争后才武装群众的偏向，这样就不易发动群众深入斗争，又不易开展运动。必须及时解除反动分子的武装，武装已起来的积极分子和群众，以发扬群众为切身利益而斗争的胜利信心。
    今天的农民武装，多采用人民自卫队的组织形式，自卫队大部实际上受农会领导，一切把枪枝用未改造的村政权都是危险的。把办理枪枝的事交给未改造的政权办，也是不妥当的。
