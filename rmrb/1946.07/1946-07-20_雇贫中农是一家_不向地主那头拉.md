　　Hired Laborers, Poor Peasants, and Middle Peasants are One Family:
    Don't Be Pulled to the Landlord's Side
    [This newspaper reports] In Beidongfang Village, Linzhang, Southern Hebei, landlords created conflicts between poor peasants, hired tenant farmers, and middle peasants. After the peasants united and shattered their conspiracy, they launched a campaign to clear debts and redeem land. This spring, the landlord clique in the village heard news of poor peasants clearing debts and redeeming land elsewhere, and pretended to care for the lives of the poor. They offered over 300 mu of farmland, which they had seized from poor peasants at low prices during famine years, to hired tenant farmers at low prices. Another portion was sold to middle peasants. Some poor peasants wanted to lease the land, but the landlords said they "didn't meet the conditions." This stirred up jealousy between the poor peasants, hired tenant farmers, and middle peasants. In April, the poor peasants in the village were preparing to redeem land. The landlords told the hired tenant farmers and middle peasants, "If they redeem the land, you won't be able to eat this season's wheat, and you probably won't get any firewood." They also incited the hired tenant farmers to report to the district, saying "the poor peasants want to redeem the land of the middle peasants." The district, not understanding the truth, simply replied according to the article "Do not infringe upon the middle peasants": "Redemption is not allowed." The hired tenant representatives immediately returned to the village, beating gongs and shouting, "Returning the land is strictly forbidden!" As a result, the poor peasants hated the hired tenant farmers and middle peasants even more. In May, the poor peasants organized a peasant association and established a militia, which stood in opposition to the original hired tenant association and militia. In June, they prepared for a campaign to clear debts, redeem land, and struggle against the evil霸保长 (ba baozhang, local strongmen). At this time, the district discovered the internal dispute among the peasants in the village. They guided the hired tenants to discuss the landlords' conspiracy of "distributing land and waiting for a change in the political climate," making the hired tenants understand that the leased land was unreliable and that they were bearing the burden for others in vain. They also enlightened the poor peasants, who accepted the principle that "clearing debts and redeeming land should take care of the middle peasants and hired tenant farmers, and that unity creates great strength." Finally, it was unanimously decided: "The land of the middle peasants will not be redeemed. After the land leased by the hired tenants is redeemed, grain will still be given to the hired tenants according to the original tenancy regulations." As a result, a unified campaign of hired tenant farmers, poor peasants, and middle peasants to clear debts and redeem land from the landlords was immediately launched smoothly and achieved victory. An old tenant farmer, Zhang Zilin, said, "Hired laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants are one family. No one should be pulled to the landlord's side again!" The village is now preparing to fight against the evil 霸保长 and is also preparing to formally merge the peasant association and the hired tenant association to unify leadership.

　　雇贫中农是一家
    不向地主那头拉
    【本报讯】冀南临漳北东坊村地主制造贫农与雇佃农及中农矛盾，经农民一致团结，击破其阴谋，开展了清债赎地运动。该村地主集团今春听到他地贫农清债赎地消息，即假装照顾穷人生活，将灾荒年从贫农手里低价夺得的耕地三百多亩，低价分散出典给雇佃农，另一部卖与中农。有些贫农想承典，地主说是“不够条件”这样激起贫农与雇佃农及中农互相忌妒，四月间该村贫农酝酿赎地，地主对雇佃农与中农说：“他们赎了地，你们就不能吃这季麦，恐怕柴草也分不上。”并挑拨雇佃农到区报告，说“贫农要赎中农的地”，区里不明真相，即依照“不侵犯中农”的条文简单回答：“不准赎”。雇佃代表马上回村，打锣大叫：“一律不准回地！”这一来，贫农更恨雇佃农与中农。五月份贫农组织农会，成立民兵，与原来的雇佃会及民兵对立。六月又酝酿清债赎地、反恶霸保长斗争。区里此时发现该村农民内争问题，即引导雇佃讨论地主“分散土地、等待变天”的阴谋，使雇佃明白了承典之地并不可靠，白替人家出负担；又启发贫农，接受了“清债赎地要照顾中农与雇佃农，大家团结力量大”的道理；最后一致决定：“中农地不赎、雇佃的承典地于赎回以后，仍按原租佃条例给雇佃粮食。”这样一来，雇佃农、贫农、中农团结一致的向地主清债赎地运动，立即顺利展开，取得胜利。佃户张自林老汉说：“雇佃贫中是一家，谁也不要再向地主那头拉！”现该村正酝酿反恶霸保长等斗争，并准备将农会与雇佃会正式合并，统一领导。
