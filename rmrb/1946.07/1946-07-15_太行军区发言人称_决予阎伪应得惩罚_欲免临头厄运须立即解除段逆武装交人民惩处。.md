　　Taihang Military Region Spokesperson Claims
　  Decisive Punishment for Puppet Yan
　　To Avoid Impending Doom, Immediately Disarm Traitor Duan and Hand Him Over to the People for Punishment.
    [This Newspaper Changzhi News] Regarding the bloodbath perpetrated by Yan's puppet Duan Bingchang's troops against the people of Qingxiu area in Wuxiang, the spokesperson of the Taihang Military Region issued a statement on the 8th, pointing out that the Shanxi reactionaries, led by Yan Xishan, in order to continue achieving their despicable goal of enslaving the people of Shanxi, do not hesitate to regard the despicable traitors and scum as precious treasures, using them to carry out inhumane massacres against innocent people and the people's armed forces who have fought hard for the country and the nation for eight years, thinking that the more tragic the massacre, the more poisonous the criminal law, the more they can subdue the people and eliminate the people's will to pursue democracy and survival. Therefore, they regard the massacre of the people of Wuxiang by the traitor Duan Bingchang this time as a satisfactory masterpiece, for which they are wildly celebrating; and they are continuing to use weapons supplied by their foreign masters to carry out larger-scale, comprehensive, and more brutal massacres against the people,妄想妄想希望妄想妄想hopeing to annihilate the people's democratic forces in one fell swoop, but they are completely wrong: their massacres can only lead to one result, which is to arouse a doubled and more fierce people's revenge movement. The 750,000 people armed in the Taihang Mountains and the more powerful regular army will give them the punishment they deserve. The spokesperson warned the Shanxi reactionaries: if they want to avoid the impending doom, they must immediately disarm the traitor Duan Bingchang and hand him over to the people; severely punish the culprits of the massacre; compensate the people for their losses; and ensure the safety of the captured people. Finally, the spokesperson called on the people of the entire region, the militiamen and commanders and fighters of the entire region to mobilize urgently, take action, stand firm in their posts, further expand the regular army and militia, improve tactics, exert greater courage, and severely crack down on the stubborn puppets who are encroaching on, destroying, and launching sneak attacks on our borders, and smash the comprehensive offensive launched by the stubborn puppets. We will definitely win! We will definitely avenge our dead compatriots!

　　太行军区发言人称
　  决予阎伪应得惩罚
　　欲免临头厄运须立即解除段逆武装交人民惩处。
    【本报长治讯】为阎伪段丙昌部屠杀武乡青修一带人民的血案，太行军区发言人于八日发表谈话，指出以阎锡山为首的山西反动派为了继续达到奴役山西人民的卑鄙目的，不惜把不齿于人的汉奸败类视若掌上珠，用来对无辜人民与为国家民族苦战八年的人民武装进行毫无人性的屠杀，以为屠杀愈惨，刑法愈毒，就愈能压服人民，消灭人民追求民主与生存的意志，因此他们把汉奸段丙昌这次对武乡人民的屠杀看做得意杰作，为此而狂欢大乐；并正在用外国主子供给的武器，继续对人民进行更大规模的、全面的，更加残暴的屠杀，妄想可以一举歼灭人民的民主力量，但是他们完全想错了：他们的屠杀只能得到一个结果，就是激起加倍猛烈的人民复仇运动。太行山七十五万人民武装与更有力量的正规军，将给他们以应得的惩罚。发言人警告山西反动派：如果他们想避免临头的厄运，那就必须立即解除段逆丙昌的武装，交给人民；严惩惨案祸首；赔偿人民损失；保证被俘人民安全。最后，发言人号召全区人民，全区民兵与部队指战员们紧急动员起来，行动起来，站好自己的岗位，更加扩大正规军与民兵，提高战术，发挥更大勇敢，痛击向我边地蚕食破坏与偷袭的顽伪，粉碎顽伪业经发动的全面进攻。我们一定能够胜利！一定能够为死难同胞复仇！
