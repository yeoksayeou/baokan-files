    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th] London Dispatch: The food situation in Britain is serious. The "Facing the Facts" Association, led by Mrs. Wall, organized a thousand housewives who gathered at Trafalgar Square on the afternoon of the 16th to angrily protest the poor bread rations. A petition to the British King, signed by more than 200,000 housewives demanding the restoration of normal food conditions and the abolition of bread rationing, was submitted to food officials of the Home Office on the 16th. The official was insulted by the angry crowd while accepting the petition, so much so that the official immediately retreated indoors.
