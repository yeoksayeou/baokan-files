　　Kuomintang Jealous of Impartial Public Opinion
    *Wen Hui Bao* Ordered to Suspend Publication for One Week
    China Bookstore in Changsha Smashed by KMT Secret Agents
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Shanghai News: *Wen Hui Bao* here has been viewed with jealousy by the Kuomintang authorities because of its impartial stance in its usual commentary. On the 17th, the city police bureau, citing an order from the Garrison Headquarters, used the excuse that the newspaper had commented on the public security organs and had published an article about a policeman complaining, and ordered it to suspend publication for one week.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th] Changsha News: The China Bookstore here has recently been smashed by secret agents and soldiers dispatched by the Kuomintang authorities. On June 5th, the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang convened a "symposium" of the heads of bookstores in the city, announcing a ban on the sale of books and periodicals of the Chinese Communist Party, the Democratic League, and all so-called "attacks on the government and betrayals of reality." That afternoon, a group of people in plain clothes, holding wooden sticks and with pistols stuck in their waists, rushed into the China Bookstore on Zhongshan West Road, shouting and punching, with fists and books flying everywhere, while the police watched from the windows. Afterwards, the store posted a sign saying "Cleaning up publications, closed for one day" and asked people to intercede, thinking that acknowledging a loss would settle the matter. Unexpectedly, the next day the authorities sent dozens more soldiers, who robbed all twenty-odd boxes of harmonicas and stationery books. 肴怂登椋?晕?匀铣钥骷纯闪耸拢?饬洗稳盏本钟峙?来士兵数十名，将二十几打口琴及文具书籍全部抢走。拢?饬洗稳盏本钟峙?来士兵数十名，将二十几打口琴及文具书籍全部抢走。

    勒令文汇报停刊一周
    长沙中国书店遭国特捣毁
    【新华社延安十九日电】沪讯：此间文汇报因平日持论公正，为国民党当局所忌，十七日本市警局以警备司令部命令，借口该报议论治安机关，并曾刊载一警察诉苦之稿件，勒令停刊一星期。
    【新华社延安二十日电】长沙息：此间中国书店近被国民党当局派遣特务及士兵捣毁。六月五日，湖南国民党省党部召集本市各书店负责人开“座谈会”，宣布禁售中共、民盟及一切所谓“攻击政府，背叛现实”的书刊。当天下午，即有一群穿着便服，手拿木棍，腰插手枪的人，拥入中山西路中国书店，高声喊打，拳头与书籍齐飞，警察则在窗外观望。事后该店张贴“清理刊物，停业一天”的纸条，并请人说情，以为自认吃亏即可了事，殊料次日当局又派来士兵数十名，将二十几打口琴及文具书籍全部抢走。肴怂登椋?晕?匀铣钥骷纯闪耸拢?饬洗稳盏本钟峙?来士兵数十名，将二十几打口琴及文具书籍全部抢走。拢?饬洗稳盏本钟峙?来士兵数十名，将二十几打口琴及文具书籍全部抢走。
