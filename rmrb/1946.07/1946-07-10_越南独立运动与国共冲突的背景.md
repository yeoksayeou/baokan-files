　　The Vietnamese independence revolution, under the leadership of the Viet Cong, has laid a solid foundation. In the six months after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Vietnamese people not only disarmed 50,000 Japanese troops, but also repelled the attacks of the Anglo-French Allied Forces dozens of times. In Saigon, Jinita and other major cities in southern Vietnam occupied by France, they are surrounded by the Vietnamese People's Army. These troops controlled all railways and highways. Moreover, in vast areas, like the liberated areas in China, they initially defined the combat task of fighting while producing.

　　The Vietnamese independent government now has 300,000 regular troops and 1.5 million militiamen who can participate in the war at any time. It has a considerable number of arsenals and can manufacture rifles, machine guns, and grenades. There are a large number of military cadres, administrative cadres, as well as a large number of engineers, doctors, lawyers, educators and cultural figures. Their leader is Ho Chi Minh (a Communist), who unites all democratic parties and people from all walks of life. All ethnic groups in Vietnam, large and small, also support the independent government. They have already achieved total national mobilization.

　　When the Japanese invaders surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang reactionaries, taking advantage of the convenience of their troops entering northern Vietnam, directed two governments in northern Vietnam. One was the Vietnamese National Government, headed by Nguyen Hai Thanh, an anti-communist leader who had colluded with the Japanese invaders. The other government was called the Provisional Government of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, headed by Cai Zhihong. These two organizations had no mass base and did not care about the people.

　　At first, the Kuomintang reactionaries insisted that these two governments without people should share the world equally with Ho Chi Minh's government, but Ho Chi Minh refused. Then, they threatened to reorganize the independent government and form a government jointly formed by the three parties, but Ho Chi Minh refused. Then, these two puppets broke into Ho Chi Minh's government to monitor and contain the activities of the independent government.

　　After that, the Kuomintang reactionaries issued a list of a group of left-wing cadres in the independent government, threatening Ho to dismiss them. Ho replied to this threat with a general election. Last December, the result of the national general election was that the left-wing cadres completely won. The two puppets, Nguyen and Cai, were purged under the public opinion of the people. Since then, the struggle between the two sides has become even more acute. The presence of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang troops in northern Vietnam is a great burden on the independent government. They use the banknotes issued by the Kuomintang in China as the currency in circulation in northern Vietnam, engaging in forced buying and selling, which has caused economic difficulties and financial chaos in northern Vietnam. After Chiang Kai-shek's army withdrew from northern Vietnam, it supplied weapons to the Vietnamese Nationalist Party.

　　越南独立运动与国共冲突的背景
    【新华社延安七日电】国际知识——“越南独立运动与国共冲突的背景”
    越南的独立革命，在越共领导之下已奠立了坚固基础。在日寇投降后的半年内，越南人民不但解除了五万日军武装，而且几十次地击退了英法联军的进攻。在越南南部法国占领的西贡、金塔等大城市，处在越南人民军队的包围中。这些军队控制了全部的铁路和公路。而且在广大的地区中犹如中国的解放区一样，开头就确定了一面战斗一面生产的战斗任务。
    越南独立政府，现拥有三十万正规军和一百五十万随时可以参战的民兵，有相当规模的兵工厂，能自造步枪机枪和手榴弹。有大批军事干部行政干部以及大批工程师医师律师教育家和文化人。他们的领袖是胡志明（共产党员），团结各民主党派与各阶层人士，越南境内的各大小民族亦拥护独立政府。他们已经做到了全民总动员。
    日寇投降时，蒋介石国民党反动派凭借着其军队开入越北的便利，在越北导演了两个政府，一个是越南国民政府，首脑是曾经和日寇勾结的反共头子阮海成，另外一个政府是叫做越南国民党的临时政府，首脑是蔡志鸿。这两个组织，根本就没有群众，不要人民的。
    开头国民党反动派硬要这两个没有人民的政府与胡志明的政府平分天下，被胡志明拒绝了。继而要胁改组独立政府，另组由三方面合组的政府，也被胡志明拒绝了。继而这两个傀儡打进胡志明政府，从中监视和牵制独立政府的活动。
    之后，国民党反动派又开出独立政府中一批左派干部的名单，要胁胡氏把他们解职，胡氏以普选来回答这种威胁。去年十二月全国曾举行普选的结果，左派的干部完全获得胜利，阮、蔡两个傀儡在人民公意之下被清洗出去了，从此双方的斗争也就更加尖锐了。蒋介石国民党军队驻扎越北，是独立政府的很大的负担，它以国民党在中国所发的纸币作为越北的流通券，强买强卖，以致造成越北经济困难、金融混乱的局面。蒋介石军队自越北撤出以后，并以武器供给越南国民党。（本文大部材料根据新加坡出版之六月十八日《风下××杂志》第十一期）
