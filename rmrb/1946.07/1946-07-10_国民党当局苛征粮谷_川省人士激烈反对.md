　　The Nationalist authorities, violating their promise to cease grain requisition in kind, continue to requisition 6 million shi of grain this year in Sichuan, which already provided over 60 million shi during the war, and also "borrow" 13 million shi (totaling 19 million shi), causing fierce opposition from Sichuan gentry and the Provincial Assembly. Sichuan gentry such as Hu Wenlan and He Lu sent a telegram to the Provincial Assembly in late June, resolutely expressing their opposition. When the Provincial Assembly discussed this proposal submitted by the Nationalist authorities on the 15th of last month, Assemblymen Chen Shugan, Yang Yulou, Wen Zancheng, and others spoke up one after another, saying that 80 percent of the people in Sichuan are on the verge of starvation, and the new grain has already been sold. If grain is still requisitioned in kind, the future of Sichuan is unimaginable. The assembly then passed a resolution to "reject outright" this proposal submitted by the government, stating that if the government insists on carrying out grain requisition in kind, they request that the assembly be dissolved to apologize to the people.

　　国民党当局苛征粮谷
    川省人士激烈反对
    【新华社重庆六日电】国民党当局违背停止征实的诺言，在抗战中已缴谷六千余万石的四川，继续于今年征实六百万石，及征借一千三百万石（共一千九百万石）的粮谷，引起四川绅耆及省参会的激烈反对。川省士绅胡文澜、何鲁等多人，于上月下旬电省参会，坚决表示反对。省参会于上月十五日讨论国民党当局交议此案时，参议员陈树干、杨雨楼、文赞成等，纷起发言，谓四川百分之八十人民逼在饥饿线上，新谷均已卖完，如果还要征实，四川前途不堪设想。该会旋通过“一概拒绝”政府此项交议的决议，表示如政府必强为办理征实，请解散本会以谢人民。
