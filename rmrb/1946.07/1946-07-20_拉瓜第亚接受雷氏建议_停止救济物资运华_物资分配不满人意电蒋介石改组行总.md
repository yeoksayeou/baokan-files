Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Washington dispatch: LaGuardia, Director of UNRRA, recently told the US Senate that the order to stop shipping supplies to China was based on the advice of Lehmann, head of the China office. The advice requested UNRRA to stop shipping supplies to China because the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) was trapped in "unstable" financial difficulties, and goods were piled up in Chinese ports, lacking transportation. Lehmann's secret report was submitted to the US Senate Appropriations Committee on the 10th when he attended the hearing to explain the suspension. LaGuardia told the US Senators that transportation would not resume until the goods piled up in Chinese ports were cleared. The report specifically cited the government's "unsound sales strategy" as the main reason for the suspension. Food relief items issued by CNRRA to coolie laborers often flowed into the "black market." Due to CNRRA's financial difficulties, UNRRA had requested the Chinese side to allocate six berths to handle unloading matters, but Soong Tzu-wen never replied. The report stated that UNRRA is now continuing to protest against the irregular actions taken by Chiang Ting-fu as expedients (such as selling relief supplies in the market). The report claimed that past efforts to properly handle relief supplies and transport them to disaster areas were "minimal," and unless a clear and orderly financial policy and procedure can be established for funding and distributing materials, there is little remedy at present. The report concluded that the most powerful measure to overcome the most important difficulties is necessary. Furthermore, LaGuardia telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek on May 28, requesting the establishment of an economically sound and effective supply distribution system and tools to quickly transport goods from various ports to the interior, and to establish a defense system to stop the resale of relief supplies. LaGuardia announced that the work of CNRRA was unsatisfactory, and therefore requested Chiang Kai-shek to give prompt consideration to the matter of reorganization.

　　拉瓜第亚接受雷氏建议
    停止救济物资运华
    物资分配不满人意电蒋介石改组行总
    【新华社延安十六日电】华盛顿讯：联总署长拉瓜第亚顷告美参院谓：停止物资运华之命令，系根据中国分署长雷氏之建议，该建议请求联总停止运华物资，盖中国行总陷于“不稳定”之财政困难中，且中国各港口货物堆积，而缺乏运输工具。按雷氏之秘密报告，系于十日当其出席解释停运会时，已送达美参院拨款委员会。拉瓜第亚告美参议员谓：在中国各港口堆积之货物未予清除前，运输将不能恢复。报告特提出停运之主要原因，为政府的“不健全之出售策略”。行总发给苦力劳工之粮食救济物品常流于“黑市”。行总之财政穷困，联总曾向中国方面要求拨用停泊所六处，以处理卸货事宜，宋子文对此终未作复。该报告称：联总现在继续对蒋廷黻所为之权宜办法（诸如在市场出售救济物资）之不规则行动，提出抗议。该报告声称：对于有利处理救济物资及转运至灾区各项工作，过去之努力“微乎其微”，除非对经费及分配物资上能厘定一清晰有条理之财政政策及程序，目前殊少补救办法。该报告末称：设法克服最主要困难之最有力措施，实属必要。又拉瓜第亚于五月二十八日曾电蒋介石，要求建立经济完善及有效之供应品分配制及工具，俾迅速将各港货物运往内地；建立防卫制，停止救济物资之转售。拉氏宣布行总之工作，不能令人满意，故要求蒋介石对改组一事，作迅速之考虑。
