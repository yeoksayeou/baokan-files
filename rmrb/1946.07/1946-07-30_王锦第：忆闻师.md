Before the "July 7th" Incident, I didn't specialize in literature at Peking University, but I was extremely interested in Mr. Wen Yiduo's lectures on the collection of ancient Chinese folk love songs, the *Book of Songs*. What he was best at and what we admired most was that he restored this classic of ancient folk songs to its original appearance. He disregarded the traditional shallow, corrupt, and ineffective interpretations and often used modern folk life and customs to illustrate his explanations of this classic.

Regarding the first poem in *Guofeng*: "Guan-guan cry the ospreys, on the islet in the river. The modest and gentle maiden is a good match for the gentleman." He said that the first two lines and the last two lines have no semantic connection, only a harmonious sound and beauty, which is common in folk songs. For example, there is a popular song in Hebei:

	"Old brother mountain, long tail, married a wife and forgot his mother."

Today, we shout the slogan "Learn from the masses," but Mr. Wen was already practicing it! His lectures on this classic were always full of life. I will give just one example to show Mr. Wen's unique teaching style.

Mr. Wen Yiduo had a strong sense of justice. I remember one time, during his class, his usual refined and gentle attitude suddenly changed. He was serious, indignant, and spoke in a heavy tone. He said:

	"Usually in class, I am afraid of delaying your studies, so I have no time to talk about anything other than the current lesson. Today, I can't stand it anymore. The enemy's secret agents (!), searched us at various universities yesterday… We must rise up! We must rise up! We must rise up!"

At this time, we young people were all excited, tears about to fall. Later, Mr. Wen silently wrote two lines of poetry on the blackboard:

	"The distant four thousand years of memory, how can I embrace you tightly?" (The general meaning is like this, perhaps the wording is wrong.)

This is a famous line from Mr. Wen Yiduo's book *Dead Water*. Some people thought that this was Mr. Wen talking about love with a woman, but he said that these four thousand years of memory are the four thousand years of national history of his motherland! His "lover" is his "motherland"! And the people of his motherland!

Now, Mr. Wen, for the future of the nation and the future of the people, did not die at the hands of foreign enemies, but died at the hands of the reactionary Kuomintang secret agents!

Mr. Wen's blood will be a beacon: telling us how to move towards the light. We firmly believe it! Mr. Wen's unfinished legacy must be the great cause that the Chinese people must complete!

From afar, I extend my condolences to Mr. Wen's younger brother, my old friend, Wen Jiasi, and his family.

　　王锦第：忆闻师
    “七七”事变前，在北大我专门学习的不是文学，但我对一多先生讲习的我国古代民间情歌集《诗经》，感到极大的兴趣。他最拿手而且使我们佩服的，就是他把这部古代民歌的古典，还它一个本来的面目，对于传统的那种浅薄、腐败而无效的讲法，他置之不理，他常用现代民间的生活与习俗，引证他对于这部古典的讲解。
    就国风第一首来说：“关关雎鸠，在河之洲，窈窕淑女，君子好逑。”他说前两句与后两句没有意思的关连，只有音韵，美的和谐，这在民歌中是常有的，例如在河北流行的一首：
    “山老哥，尾巴长，嫁了媳妇忘了娘。”
    今日我们喊出“向大众学习”的口号，而一多先生早已在那儿实践了！他讲这部古典，总是生趣勃勃的，我现在只举一个例子，可以知道先生别出心裁的讲学作风。
    一多先生抱有强烈的正义感。记得有一次，他上课的时候，平常他那种儒雅温厚的态度忽然变了，严肃的愤慨万状的，用着沉重的调子，我们说：
    “平时在上课的时候，我怕误了功课，所以除了本课以外，没有时间讲别的，今天我不能再忍了，“敌人的特务”（！）昨天在各大学搜查我们了……我们要起来！我们要起来！我们要起来！”
    这时我们这群青年都兴奋起来，泪要流下来了，后来一多先生默默地在黑板上写了两句诗：
    “悠远的四千年记忆，让我如何拥抱得紧你？”（大意是这样，也许字句有误）
    这是一多先生所著《死水》上的名句。有人以为这是先生同某女子讲恋爱，其实他说这四千年的记忆，就是他祖国四千年的民族史！他的“爱人”就是他的“祖国”！和祖国的人民！
    现在一多先生为了民族的前途，为了人民的前途，没有死在外贼之手，而死在家贼反动派特务的毒手中了！
    先生的鲜血将是一座灯塔：告诉我们怎样走向光明，我们坚决相信！一多先生未完成的遗志，必是中国人民一定要完成的大业！
    迢迢远途，我向先生的令弟，我的老友，闻家驷兄及他的家属致唁。
