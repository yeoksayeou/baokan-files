　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Paris dispatch: The Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference concluded last night. The Foreign Ministers said goodbye, saying they would meet again at the Peace Conference. The Foreign Ministers are eager to return to their countries so that they can have detailed consultations with their respective governments before the convening of the Peace Conference on July 29th. This session of the Foreign Ministers Conference resumed in Paris on the 15th of last month. The topics involved included the draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, and the German question. The Austrian question and the political situation in Italy were not discussed. The Four Power Foreign Ministers have reached agreements on all important issues in the five-nation peace treaties. There has also been a broad exchange of views on the fundamental principles for the treaty with Germany and the political and economic handling of Germany, and it has been decided that a special meeting of the Foreign Ministers will be convened after the conclusion of the United Nations General Assembly in September to specifically discuss it. At the last meeting last night, the four foreign ministers agreed on the ten remaining minor issues in the draft five-nation peace treaties and submitted them directly to the 21-nation peace conference for discussion.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Paris dispatch: The last day of the Foreign Ministers Conference (the 12th) was mostly spent discussing German reparations and the current plan for German economic unification, without achieving any results. At the Foreign Ministers Conference on the 11th, when continuing to discuss the German question, the American delegation attempted to overturn a passage in Molotov's statement on the draft American treaty, which stated that "at the Crimea Conference, the Soviet and American governments both believed that it was possible for the Soviet Union to obtain reparations from Germany in the amount of 10 billion US dollars." The Soviet delegation reiterated its statement, pointing out the circumstances of the negotiations regarding German reparations at the Crimea Conference. The records of the negotiations were signed by Roosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill. The Soviet delegation also presented many facts proving the decision of the Oak Ridge Conference on the issue of reparations. During the discussion of the German question, British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed that when paying reparations in commodities from various zones, payment should only be permitted if there was no deficit on the part of each zone's government. TASS reporters pointed out that these conditions were tantamount to refusing reparations and were completely contradictory to the Potsdam Resolution. The Foreign Ministers also discussed the Soviet delegation's proposal to study the establishment of a committee for the military and economic disarmament of Germany, but due to the opposition of the American and British delegations, the Soviet proposal was not adopted.

　　巴黎外长会议结束
    德赔款问题讨论无结果
    各外长告别：和会上再见！
    【新华社延安十三日电】巴黎讯：四强外长会议已于昨夜结束，各外长于别离时说和会上再见。各外长急于回国，期于七月廿九日和会召开之前，能与各该国政府进行详细会商。本届外长会议是于上月十五日起在巴黎复会的，牵涉的议题，计有对意、罗、保、匈、芬五国和约草案与德国问题。奥地利问题，与意大利政治形势，均未及讨论。关于五国和约中各重要问题，四强外长均已获致协议。关于对德和约及在政治经济上处理德国的根本方针，亦已广泛交换意见，并决定在九月间召开的联合国大会结束之后，再召开外特长别会议，专门予以讨论。在昨夜最后一次会议上，四外长同意五国和约草案中未了的十个次要问题，并直接提交二十一国和会讨论之。
    【新华社延安十三日电】巴黎讯：外长会议的最后一日（十二日），大部分时间讨论德国赔款与目前德国的经济统一计划，未获结果。在十一日外长会议继续讨论德国问题时，美国代表团企图推翻莫洛托夫关于美国条约草案声明中所说的一段话“在克里米亚会议上，苏、美两国政府都认为有可能使苏联从德国方面获得的赔偿，应当为一百万万美元”。苏联代表团再次说明自己的声明，指出在克里米亚会议上关于德国应付赔款进行谈判的情形。谈判的记录，罗斯福、斯大林与邱吉尔都已签了字。苏联代表团又提出许多事实，证明橡树林会议关于赔款问题的决议。在讨论德国问题进程时，英外长贝文提出建议，认为在以各区域的商品支付赔款时，要在每一区域政府方面没有亏空的条件下，始允以商品支付赔款。塔斯社记者指出，这些条件等于拒绝赔款，完全与波茨顿决议相矛盾。各外长还讨论了苏联代表团关于研究在军事与经济上解除德国武装委员会的提议，但是由于美英代表团的反对，苏联的提议未获通过。
