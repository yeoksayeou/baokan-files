　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 29th—A delegation of Mongol petitioners from central and northern Jehol Province came to Chengde again to appeal to Mr. Peng Teh of UNRRA for a fair distribution of relief supplies. On the 17th, Mr. Peng Teh and Mr. Schlein of UNRRA, Mr. Li Peiyuan and Mr. Qian Juyi of CNRRA, and Director Zhu of the branch office, met with the petition delegation at the relief branch office. The delegation, representing Mongols from the Left and Right Banners of Barin, the Har Banner of Ongniut, the Har Banner of Kalachin, the Keshigten Banner, and the Tumed Banner, expressed regret that the current UNRRA-CNRRA decision on relief for Jehol did not include the central and northern Jehol areas. It was stated that the Mongol and Han people in that area are suffering severely, with a dire shortage of food. Starving people are eating tree roots to survive, and they urgently hope that UNRRA will transport food and fur clothing to provide relief. Mr. Li Peiyuan of CNRRA replied, "There are other assigned workers responsible for the areas over there." The representatives said in unison, "Until now, we haven't seen an inch of cloth or a grain of food." Mr. Li said, "Perhaps it's due to inconvenient transportation." Representative A Meng replied, "It can go directly from Chengde to that area via Chifeng, and we guarantee that it will be 100% delivered to the people in need." Mr. Qian then said, "You have Mongol representatives in Beiping who are handling these matters." The representative of the Keshigten Banner immediately declared, "We have never sent any Mongol representatives to Beiping. The Mongol representatives in Beiping cannot represent us and will certainly not provide relief to the Mongol people in the liberated areas." Finally, Mr. Peng Teh stated that he was willing to work hard for the Mongol victims. The representatives expressed their gratitude for this. In addition, five representatives of disaster victims from eastern and western Jehol, including Zhang Yiyu, also jointly sent a letter to Mr. Peng Teh, appealing for an investigation and relief for the disaster victims in that area.

　　热河蒙民要求联总
    公平分配救济物资
    【新华社承德二十九日电】热河中部与北部蒙民请愿团，再次来承向联总彭德先生呼吁公平分配救济物资。十七日，联总彭德、施琳先生、行总李培垣、钱举一先生及分会朱主任，特于救济分会接见请愿团。该请愿团代表巴林左右旗、翁牛特哈旗、喀喇沁哈旗、克什克腾旗、吐额特旗等七旗蒙民，对此次联总行总决定之热河救济中不包括热中热北地区表示遗憾。据称：该地蒙汉民受灾甚重，粮食奇缺，灾民以树根充食，亟望联总运送粮食与皮毛衣物予以救济。行总李培垣氏答称：“那边另有划分之工作人负责”。代表齐声称：“直至现在还见不到一寸布一粒粮”。李氏称：“也许交通不便”。代表阿蒙答谓：“可由承德经赤峰直抵该处，保证能百分之百发到救民手里”。钱氏又称：“北平有你们的蒙古代表正在办理这些事情”。克什克腾旗代表立即声明：“我们从未派遣过蒙古代表赴平，北平的蒙古代表不能代表我们，也绝不会救济解放区的蒙民”。最后彭德先生表示愿为蒙古灾民努力。各代表对此表示感谢。又热东热西等地灾民代表张一宇等五人，亦联名致函彭德先生，呼吁调查并救济该处灾民。
