　　Cultural and Educational Circles in Handan City
    Commemorate Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo
    General Gao Shuxun Sends Telegram of Condolences to Chairman of the China Democratic League and Families of Li and Wen
    [Handan, 22nd Dispatch] Following the sudden assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, figures from cultural and educational circles in Handan City held a grand memorial meeting and forum at the auditorium of Handan High School a few days ago. Present were leading figures from various agencies in the border region, members of the cultural and educational circles of Handan, and students, totaling over 300 people. The meeting place was decorated simply and solemnly, with plain wreaths contrasting with the black-framed memorial slogans: "Avenge the Martyrs Li and Wen!" "Commemorate the Martyrs Li and Wen by actively supporting the democratic movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas!" "Commemorate the Martyrs Li and Wen, and accelerate the completion of China's independent, peaceful, and democratic cause!" The entire venue was filled with an atmosphere of grief and indignation. As people stood up and bowed their heads in mourning for the Martyrs Li and Wen, their hearts were filled with the fire of hatred for fascism and with the conviction of victory.

    After the chairman reported on the circumstances of the two martyrs' deaths, Mr. Yang Xiufeng, former famous professor of Beiping and current chairman of the border region government, began to speak. He first pointed out that simultaneously with the deaths of Li and Wen, this border region and other liberated areas had been attacked by Chiang's troops. He called on everyone to take action for self-defense! And to fully support the democratic movement in the rear, saying, "If democrats can no longer live in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, we welcome them to come to the liberated areas!" Comrade Zhang Zesun, Li's nephew, after recounting Li's life, expressed with grief and indignation that he would be the first to respond to Chairman Yang's call by writing to relatives and friends in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, encouraging them to inherit Li's legacy and fight to the end. Following speeches by Ren Baige, director of the military region's propaganda department, and Principal Zhang of Handan High School, a Handan High School student said excitedly: "Chiang Kai-shek uses American weapons to massacre the people of the liberated areas and the democrats in his controlled areas, and also sends American-made planes to scare us, but we cannot be intimidated. We will surely win. The Ping-Han Campaign last year is proof of this." Finally, the conference sent telegrams of condolences to the China Democratic League and the families of Li and Wen, and sent a circular calling on cultural and educational figures across the country to fight to the end to fulfill the wishes of the two martyrs.

    [Handan, 23rd Dispatch] General Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army, sent a telegram of condolences to Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, and the families of Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo. The original telegram is as follows:

    I am shocked to hear that Mr. Li Gongpu and Mr. Wen Yiduo were suddenly assassinated by reactionary secret agents. The tragic news has arrived, and my grief and indignation are beyond words. Mr. Gongpu has dedicated his life to China's independence, peace, and democracy. All Chinese people love and respect him. The reactionary faction, in its madness, has resorted to this sinister plot, which is self-isolation from the Chinese people. All officers and soldiers of this army mourn the deaths of the two gentlemen and vow to fight to the end to fulfill their legacy. I am sending this telegram to express my condolences, hoping you will restrain your grief. Respectfully, Gao Shuxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Democratic National Construction Army.
