　　The "Might as Well" Song
　　Ren Jun
    Might as well invite foreigners to run the house,
     It is said that "old foreigners" are more capable than Chinese.
     Might as well open all inland river ports,
     Let unequal treaties live forever.
     Might as well move the front gate next to the White House,
     It's convenient to ask for instructions and pay respects.
     Might as well invite foreigners to set up arsenals,
     To save the trouble of shipping airplanes and cannons for the civil war.
     Might as well ban both the national language and dialects,
     How nice it is to say "How are You!" all the time?
     Might as well eat milk powder and tangerines for meals,
     Good nutrition and strong price.
     Might as well send a large number of jeep girls to study abroad,
     They will come back and give birth to many little babies, white and fat,
     And with blue eyes and high noses.
     "ok!" Exactly like a foreign doll!
     "ok!" Exactly like a foreign baby girl!
              (Shanghai, "Poetry and Music" Issue 1)

　　索性歌
　　任钧
    索性请洋人出来当家，
     据说“老番”的能力都比国人强。
     索性把内河口岸都开放，
     不平等条约万寿无疆。
     索性把街门搬到白宫旁，
     请示晋谒都便当。
     索性请洋人过来开设兵工厂，
     省得打内战的飞机大炮用船装。
     索性把国语方言都禁用，
     满口“How are You！”多漂亮？
     索性把奶粉蜜橘当饭吃，
     营养又好价又强。
     索性把大批吉普小姐派遣去留洋，
     回来生下许多小宝宝又白又胖，
     还有那蓝眼睛高鼻梁。
     “ok！”真正跟洋娃娃一模一样！
     “ok！”真正跟洋囡囡一模一模！
              （沪，《诗歌与音乐》第一期）
