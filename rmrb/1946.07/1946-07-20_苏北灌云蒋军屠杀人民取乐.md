Xinhua News Agency, Muyang, 16th. Jiang troops in Guanyun, Northern Jiangsu, are massacring innocent people for amusement. According to Tang Dianchu, an old farmer from Punan Township, Muyang, who recently escaped from the area, he went to his daughter's home in Guanyun on May 13th to seek medical treatment for an illness. That night, he was arrested by the "Military-Civilian Joint Inspection Team" formed by Kuomintang secret agents and puppet troops, who considered him a spy for the Eighth Route Army, and detained him in prison. On Tang's first night in prison, a Shandong merchant named Liu, who was in the same cell, was dragged out and buried alive. The next day, four more merchants were arrested and buried alive that night. On the third day, two more women were buried alive. According to villagers who witnessed this tragedy, the burial site was outside the North Gate, and the method was to first dig a round pit more than one person deep, pour water into it to make a slurry, and then insert the head of the person being buried into the mud. After a few minutes, the buried person would let out their last breath, which sounded very loud. The Jiang troops called this "firing a cannon." Each time they buried someone alive, they would wait to hear the "cannon fire" before howling and leaving. Tang was fortunate enough to be spared from being buried alive after being brutally beaten and then redeemed by his family for 250,000 yuan in legal tender.

　　苏北灌云蒋军屠杀人民取乐
    【新华社沐阳十六日电】苏北灌云蒋军以屠杀无辜人民取乐。据甫自该地逃归之沐阳浦南乡老农唐殿初说，彼于五月十三日因病在灌云女儿家就医，当夜即被顽伪特务合组之“军民纠察队”逮捕，认为八路军探子，扣押入狱。唐在狱中之第一夜，即有同牢山东商人刘某被拖出去活埋。次日又抓来四个商人，当夜即遭活埋。第三天，又有妇女两人遭活埋。据目睹此惨剧之乡民透露，埋人地址在北门外，方法是先挖一个一人多深的圆坑，灌水入内，和成泥浆后，将被埋者的头朝下插入泥中，数分钟后，被埋者放出最后一口气，声音甚响，蒋军称之为“打炮”，每次活埋均待听“打炮”后，始呼啸而去。唐某系于惨遭毒打后，经家人以二十五万元法币赎出，得幸免于活埋。
