　　Road to Glory
　　——Commemorating the First Anniversary of the “July 17th” Uprising of the 17th Division
　　“One more toast, another toast to our glorious righteous act!” The people around the round table, already slightly tipsy, stood up and congratulated each other in thick Shaanxi accents, raising their glasses once more and heartily drinking the red wine in one gulp.

　　Officers above the regimental level of the 17th Division gathered for a banquet to celebrate the first anniversary of the "July 17th" Uprising. Almost all of them were staunch Guanzhong natives, who had received long-term education and training in the Northwest Army. Like the Northwest Army, they had a glorious past and a later period of heartbreaking history. Under the oppression, persecution, division, and attempts at exclusive control by Chiang Kai-shek, they struggled to lead this army of the Northwest people, loyal to the sacred War of Resistance Against Japan. But Chiang Kai-shek would not rest until all the "miscellaneous troops" were eliminated. On this day last year, the 17th Division had no choice but to launch an uprising against the civil war in Guxian Town, Luoning, Henan, crossing the rapidly rising Luo River and embarking on a glorious new path. Now, on this memorable anniversary, facing the Kuomintang reactionaries who have taken refuge with imperialism and are baring their teeth and brandishing their claws at the Chinese people, they all feel an overwhelming sense of anger.

　　General Yang Hucheng personally founded this peasant revolutionary armed force as early as the Xinhai Revolution. Perhaps events before the Northern Expedition are less familiar to readers, but mentioning the Xi'an Incident will forever fill every patriotic person with the greatest gratitude. And the 17th Division was one of the powerful forces that bravely rose up at that time, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to stop the civil war and accept the people's demands for resistance against Japan. Precisely because of this, Chiang Kai-shek used every despicable means to sabotage and disintegrate them. The designation of the Northwest Army was the 17th Route Army, with two armies and two divisions, plus the troops of the Garrison Brigade and the Special Forces Corps of the Longdong Pacification Headquarters, totaling forty-two regiments, a strong force of more than 80,000 men.

　　Chiang used four million yuan to buy off Feng Qin'ai's 42nd Division, reorganizing it into the 27th Route Army. Wang Jingzhai, under the instigation of secret agents, led two regiments in a mutiny, which was reorganized into the New 35th Division. He also used official ranks to lure Yang Qutong's Longdong Pacification Headquarters into becoming the New 5th Division. Tang Deying's two regiments of the Garrison 2nd Brigade mutinied and were reorganized into the Advance Detachment. Using reorganization methods, the Garrison 1st Brigade was reorganized into the New 27th Division. Although the original Northwest Army still had the designations of two armies and two divisions (17th Division and 117th Division), the troops added together numbered only nineteen regiments, about 40,000 men.

　　The officers and soldiers of the Northwest Army went to the anti-Japanese battlefield with unwavering loyalty, and Chiang Kai-shek took advantage of this to weaken and eliminate them. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the 17th Division participated in the Baoding, Caohe, Qinghe, and Mancheng lines, but was divided into battalions and separately added to Guan Linzheng's troops for combat. In September 1937, the Kuomintang army retreated greatly, and the 17th Division advanced through Shijiazhuang to fight at Xuehua Mountain and Wululing in Niangziguan. The entire division suffered losses of more than 2,000 men without replenishment. In March 1938, it advanced to southeastern Shanxi to combine with the people's guerrillas deep behind enemy lines. By 1940, it had repelled nine enemy "sweeps" in Pinglu, southern Shanxi, defending Zhongtiao Mountain. At this point, Chiang Kai-shek saw that the strength of the Northwest Army had grown again and was not easy to eliminate at once, so he promoted Sun Weiru, the army commander, to commander of the Fourth Army Group, Zhao Shoushan, the commander of the 17th Division, to commander of the 38th Army, and the 177th Division was also upgraded to the 96th Army, but the troops numbered only eight regiments, about 10,000 men. The sharp blade hidden in this promotion was to separate some of the key cadres from their original units, allowing a large number of central army troops and students to be inserted. All those active in resisting Japan were regarded as communists and dangerous elements, and were repeatedly put on lists to be arrested and sent to concentration camps, and troops were transferred to the south bank of the Yellow River to take charge of river defense from Fanshui to Rongzekou. In August 1941, the enemy crossed the Yellow River by stealth and occupied Zhengzhou. The 17th Division fought fiercely with more than 40,000 enemy troops in the Zheng (zhou) Guang (wu) area for nearly a month. Chiang Kai-shek did not provide a single soldier or bullet of support. Advancing meant annihilation, and retreating meant punishment. The officers and soldiers fought bravely and finally defended Zhengzhou. Subsequently, they confronted the enemy on the Yellow River Iron Bridge for two years. In August 1943, they were relieved by the 85th Army and transferred to the Gongyan area for reorganization. Zhao was transferred to Chongqing for training, and Chiang sent the secret agent Zhang Ming to rule the troops. Zhang soon became known as "Zhang Yaoming" (Zhang the Life-Taker) by all the officers and soldiers for his astonishing corruption. He monopolized more than 10,000 empty names, and only four taels of hemp sandals were issued every three months. The soldiers were yellow-faced and emaciated, unable to endure hunger, but he openly said leisurely during his admonitory speech: "Livestock can get fat by eating grass, and people can also gain weight by eating grass!"

　　During the Central Plains Battle, Tang Enbo's corps rolled away like "Tangyuan" (glutinous rice balls), retreating a hundred miles a day. As six cities were lost in seven days, the 38th Army fought fiercely with 30,000 enemy troops for nineteen days and nights in the national defense positions between Hulaoguan Mountain and Xiaoguan, standing firm. Chiang Dingwen retreated to Luoning, a hundred miles southwest of Luoyang, and then ordered them to retreat through Xin'an. However, the Longmen of Luoyang had been lost, and the encirclement was heavy. The officers and soldiers, with a determination to die, bravely charged and broke through the encirclement. Zhang Junzhen, the division commander at the time, led the 50th Regiment, which was all gloriously martyred in this battle. The route was repeatedly bombarded by enemy aircraft, and 300 people and 200 horses died at the Guandi Temple alone. Zhang Yaoming clapped his hands and laughed in the rear command post: "The old foundation of the 17th Route Army is finished this time!" Tang's corps was transferred to Hanzhong for reorganization, and was replenished in one month, but the 38th Army only rested for three days in Minxiang, without receiving a single soldier or bullet, and was ordered to counterattack Lushi Luoning. Chiang Dingwen secretly ordered "put out as many regiments as you have." This shows his cruel conspiracy to kill with a borrowed knife. All the officers and soldiers could not bear it, but that year they still fought heroically against the enemy for more than a month on the sixty-mile position from Changshui to the Eighteen Bends. Later, they were forced to attack the Eighth Route Army in western Henan, coordinating with the large-scale anti-communist and anti-people civil war launched in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia at that time.

　　How should patriotic soldiers act in the face of this severe test? The officers and soldiers of the 17th Division answered the shameless reactionaries with an uprising against the civil war, and set a glorious example for patriotic soldiers throughout the country!

　　This is a glorious road. Liu Mao, a soldier of the 1st Machine Gun Company of the 50th Regiment, wrote on the wall newspaper commemorating the uprising: "When I go back, I must tell my son to remember our glorious story!" Over the past year, the 17th Division has received warm brotherly love from the people, government, and army of the Jinji-Luyu region. The mountainous area, which does not produce wheat, has specially prepared white flour for them. Old men in their seventies travel a hundred miles to send pigs and sheep to comfort them. The 17th Division is worthy of such passionate love. As soon as it arrived in the liberated area, it participated in the counter-offensive against the Japanese invaders, cooperating with the Taiyue troops to recapture Yuanqu City, and in the dangerous days that followed, fought shoulder to shoulder with the Eighth Route Army, bravely and resolutely, to defend peace and democracy!

　　This is a glorious road. On this road, the officers and soldiers of the 17th Division have restored the glory of history, strengthened and tempered themselves, and gradually grown into a steel-like people's army! In their year of combat, the number of prisoners captured alone reached 4,065. Don't think this is a small number. Under the command of stupid Kuomintang generals, they would never dare to dream of such a thing. Many middle and lower-ranking officers told me that in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the government disappears as soon as a battle starts, and the common people run further and further away. If the army cannot get enough to eat, it will spoil the common people. In the liberated areas, government personnel lead countless masses to transport ammunition and wounded within machine gun range, and militia self-defense teams automatically scout and cooperate everywhere. They said: "We fully understand why the Eighth Route Army is an invincible army!" Once, they cooperated with the Taiyue × Regiment on Jiezishan on the Baijin Line. They saw the brave soldiers of the × Regiment, on the mountain top that had been almost leveled by artillery fire, calmly insisting on guarding in the corpses and blood of their comrades. The great spirit of the people's army inspired them, making them deeply feel the supreme glory of fighting alongside such fraternal troops. Therefore, they have worked harder to rectify and improve themselves: automatically opposing and stopping violations of the interests of the masses has become a trend in the 17th Division. They have emerged many heroes and models in helping the masses with the wheat harvest. Wang Wenxue, a soldier of the 8th Company of the 50th Regiment, had sores all over his body, but angrily said that the squad leader looked down on him for not letting him cut wheat, and as a result, he cut three acres in one day. When the 5th Corps was fighting on the Baijin Line, their hands and feet were frozen stiff at night, but no one took off a prisoner's coat.

　　Many soldiers who were conscripted from the Kuomintang-controlled areas have come to understand the meaning of being a soldier after the "speaking bitterness" movement. They used to try to escape, but now they are determined to carry the revolution through to the end. Cao Jingfu wrote in his diary: "Is this the time to go home? Can we watch the imperialists and Kuomintang reactionaries kill our vast people?" Huang Jingui wrote in a wall newspaper article entitled "I've Figured it Out": "The Kuomintang side is for Chiang Kai-shek alone, but now our people's army is for the common people, training and taking classes every day, and we ourselves are making progress and developing!"

　　About 5% of the miscellaneous personnel of the 17th Division were addicted to bad habits under the poisonous policies of the Kuomintang, but now they have all given them up. They receive more vegetable money and white flour than ordinary people, and are given special care, management, and medical treatment when they stop working. They gratefully say: "Even my own parents wouldn't do this much, it would be really ungrateful not to quit!" Now, no matter who it is or what it is, anything that is detrimental to the honor of the people's army will be subject to the universal and severe condemnation of the officers and soldiers: "Oppose that set of Chiang Kai-shek's!" "That set of Chiang Kai-shek's doesn't work!" Shaanxi people like to say "that set," and this word especially expresses the staunch character of Shaanxi people! They have grown new love, love for the people, love for the people's leader, Chairman Mao.

　　After talking with me, many officers and soldiers expressed the hope that I would tell the glorious road they have taken to all the armies of China and all the people of the country. And tell all the bellicose Kuomintang reactionaries that if they dare to attack the liberated areas of peace and democracy, they are ready with angry fists of revenge!

　　光荣之路
    ——纪念十七师“七一七”起义一周年
    “再干一杯，为我们光荣的义举再干一杯吧!”围着圆桌已经微醺的人们站起来，争着用重浊的陕西话相互祝贺，再一次举起酒杯，纵情地把红色的葡萄酒一饮而尽。
    十七师团以上官长聚宴欢庆“七一七”起义的一周年。他们几乎全是刚强的关中子弟，在西北军中受了长久的教养和锻炼，和西北军同时，他们有着光荣的过去和以后一段令人悲愤的历史。在蒋介石摧残、逼害、分化、独吞之下，他们艰难地带领着这支西北人民的军队，效忠于神圣的抗日战争。但蒋介石不把所有杂牌全部消灭是不肯甘休的，去年今日，十七师不得已在河南洛宁故县镇举行反内战起义，渡过暴涨的洛河，踏上光荣的新道路。现在在这个可纪念的节日，面对着投靠帝国主义而向中国人民张牙舞爪的国民党反动派，他们全体都有着很难抑制的愤怒。
    杨虎城将军早在辛亥革命时代就手创了这支农民革命武装，也许北伐以前的事情对读者已经比较生疏，但提起西安事变却会使每个爱国人士永远怀着最大的感激。而十七师，就是那时英勇地起来逼使蒋介石停止内战，接受人民抗日要求的有力部队之一。正因为如此，蒋介石便用一切卑鄙的手段破坏瓦解他们。西北军的番号是第十七路军，辖两个军两个师，加警备旅特种兵团及陇东绥靖司令部的部队，一共四十二个团，兵强马壮的有八万多人。
    蒋以四百万元收买四十二师冯钦哉部，编为二十七路军，王静斋在特务唆使下率两个团哗变，编为新三五师。又用官级诱惑陇东绥靖司令杨渠统部编为新五师，警二旅唐德盈部两个团哗变，编为挺进支队，用整编方式，将警一旅编为新廿七师。原西北军虽仍有两个军两个师（十七师一一七师）的番号，但部队加在一起，却只有十九个团约四万人了。
    西北军官兵是以赤胆忠心奔赴抗日战场的，而蒋介石就利用这点削弱与消灭他们。抗战开始十七师参加保定、曹河、清河、满城之线，竟被分割以营为单位分别增补关麟征部作战，三七年九月国民党军大退却，十七师经石家庄进至娘子关之雪花山五驴岭作战。全师损失二千余人，未得补充。三八年三月，进至晋东南深入敌后结合人民游击，至四○年，在晋南平陆，击退敌人九次“扫荡”，保卫了中条山。至此，蒋介石见西北军力量又壮大起来，一下不易消灭，乃升孙蔚如军长为四集团军司令，十七师师长赵寿山升为三八军军长，一七七师亦升级为九六军，但部队却只有八个团约万余人了。这幅升官图内藏的利刃，是将一些基干脱离原来部队，使大批中央军及学生插进来。凡抗日积极者都被目为共产党及危险分子，屡次列名单捕入集中营并调部队至黄河南岸，担任泛水至荣泽口河防。四一年八月，敌偷渡黄河，攻占郑州，十七师在郑（州）广（武）地区与敌四万余人激战近月，蒋介石无一兵一弹之援，进则被歼，退则受罚，官兵奋战，终于保卫了郑州。嗣在黄河铁桥与敌对峙两年之久。四三年八月始由八五军接防，转至巩偃地区整训。赵被调往重庆受训，蒋派特务张明来统治部队。张不久即以惊人的贪污被所有官兵呼为“张要命”，他独占了一万多空名字，草鞋麻三个月只发四两。士兵们脸黄肌瘦饿得无法忍耐，他却公开在训话时悠然自得的说：“牲口吃草可以肥，人吃草也可以上膘！”
    中原会战，汤恩伯兵团像“汤团”似的滚滚奔逃，日蹙百里，七日失六城之际，三八军却在虎牢关山小关间国防阵地与敌三万余激战十九昼夜，屹然不动。蒋鼎文退至洛阳西南百里之洛宁，始令其经新安撤退，然洛阳龙门已失，包围重重，官兵以必死决心，奋勇冲击突围，张俊振师长当时所率之五十团，即于此役全部壮烈殉难，沿路复惨遭敌机轰炸，关帝庙一次就死三百人，二百匹马，张耀明却在后边指挥所里拍手大笑：“这一下十七路的老基本可完了！”汤兵团调汉中整训，一月补充完毕，三八军仅在闵乡休息三天，一兵一弹未补，即令反攻芦氏洛宁，蒋鼎文密令“有几个团摆几个团”。由此可见，其借刀杀人的残忍阴谋，全体官兵忍无可忍，但该年仍在长水迄十八盘六十里阵地上，与敌英勇抗击月余。后并逼令进攻豫西八路军，配合当时向陕甘宁发动的大规模反共反人民内战。
    爱国的军人在这严酷的考验面前应该怎样？十七师全体官兵以反内战的起义回答无耻的反动派，并为全国爱国军人作了光荣的示范！
    这是一条光荣的道路。五十团机一连战士刘茂在纪念起义的墙报上写道：“我回去一定告诉儿子，记住我们光荣的故事！”一年来，十七师备受晋冀鲁豫区人民、政府、军队热烈的兄弟之爱，不出产麦子的山地特为他们准备了白面，七十老汉赶百里远路送猪羊去慰劳他们。十七师是值得如此热爱的，它一到解放区就参加反攻日寇大进军，配合太岳部队光复垣曲城，并在以后那些险恶的日子里，与八路军并肩英勇坚决地为保卫和平民主而战！
    这是一条光荣的道路，十七师官兵在这条路上恢复了历史的光荣，壮大与锻炼了自己，逐渐成长为钢铁般的人民军队！他们一年的战绩，仅俘获一项就有四千零六十五人，不要以为这是不大的数目，在愚蠢的国民党将领挨打的指挥下，做梦也不敢这样想的。许多中下级军官告诉我，在国民党统治区，一打仗就看不见政府，老百姓也是越跑越远，军队吃不上饭就糟踏老百姓。在解放区，政府人员带领着数不清的群众在机枪射程之内运送弹药和伤员，民兵自卫队自动在各处侦察配合。他们说：“我们完全了解八路军为什么是百战百胜的军队！”有一次他们在白晋线介子山上，与太岳×团协同动作。看见几乎被炮轰平了的山头上，×团英勇的战士在伙伴的尸体和血泊中镇静地坚持着守卫。人民军队的伟大精神鼓舞了他们，使他们深深感到与这样的兄弟军队并肩作战的无上光荣。因而更加努力整饬与提高自己：自动反对与制止违犯群众利益在十七师已成为一种风气，他们在帮助群众麦收中涌现了不少的英雄模范。五十团八连战士王文学身上长疮，却生气地说班长不让他去割麦是看不起他，结果一天割了三亩。五兵团在白晋线作战时，夜间冻得手脚僵硬，但没有谁脱过俘虏的一件大衣。
    许多国民党统治区抓壮丁抓来的士兵经过诉苦运动认识了当兵的意义。过去企图逃跑，现在则坚决要求革命到底。曹静夫在日记上写着：“这是回家的时候吗？能看着帝国主义和国民党反动派把我们广大人民杀死吗？”黄金贵在“我想通了”的墙报稿中写着：“国民党那边是为蒋介石一个人，现在咱人民军队为老百姓，一天天练兵上课，自己也进步发展！”
    十七师的杂务人员，约有百分之五在国民党毒化政策下染有嗜好，现在都戒绝了。他们得到多于一般人的菜金白面，停止工作给以专门的照顾管理和医治。他们感激的说：“自己的父母也不过如此，再不戒掉真对不起人哪！”现在无论是谁，无论是什么事，只要是有损于人民军队的荣誉的，都会受到官兵普遍而严厉的责备：“反对蒋介石的那一套！”“搞蒋介石的那一套吃不开！”陕西人爱说：“那一套”这个话，这个话也特别能表现陕西人刚强的特色！他们生长了新的爱，爱人民，爱人民的领袖毛主席。
    许多官兵和我谈话之后，都表示希望我把他们所走的光荣的道路，告诉全中国的军队和全国的人民。并且告诉所有好战的国民党反动派，如果胆敢向和平民主的解放区进攻，他们已准备好愤怒的复仇的铁拳！
