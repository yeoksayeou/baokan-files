　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Shanghai News: Two hundred and sixty-two people from Shanghai's literary, drama, film, music, fine arts, cartoon, and woodcut circles jointly issued a "Declaration of Freedom Against Civil War by Shanghai Cultural Circles" of more than four thousand words, putting forward three demands to the authorities: (1) Immediately stop the civil war: Our people want to live and work in peace and contentment, and want peaceful economic construction, not a "national suicide" civil war. To be clear, we are not "anti-internal disorder" but "anti-civil war." (2) Effectively guarantee the people's freedom: Immediately promulgate laws to protect the people’s basic freedoms (missing number) in order to ensure that this demand is not just empty words and to realize a democratic China as soon as possible, we demand the early organization of a coalition government that can truly represent the interests of the people. (3) Protect national industry and improve people's lives: Immediately abolish the foreign customs service, reclaim the right to navigate inland rivers, control unnecessary imports, protect national industry, stop all self-destructive war consumption, stop vicious inflation, strictly prohibit corruption and hoarding, and stabilize prices. The declaration then requests the Chinese Communist Party to make every effort to achieve lasting peace. Finally, it requests the American government and people to listen to the voice of the Chinese people, to correct the self-contradictory and harmful policy towards China, and not to provide military and financial assistance to any party engaged in civil war, so as to avoid making the Chinese problem more complicated and to maintain the best friendship between the Chinese and American people.
