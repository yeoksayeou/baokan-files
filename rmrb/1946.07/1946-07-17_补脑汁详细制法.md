　　Detailed Recipe for Brain Tonic
    The previous publication of this newspaper carried the news of the × Column ×× Brigade Health Department's invention of Brain Tonic. Readers have written to inquire about the detailed preparation method. Now, with the detailed response from the department, we are publishing it for our readers.
    [Heze, 13th] The ×× Brigade Health Department's Brain Tonic preparation method:
    (1) Use one to two fresh, disease-free raw pig brains, add fifty to sixty CC of wine, stir and crush them thoroughly into a porridge-like consistency, and filter out one hundred and twenty-three CC of brain juice using fine cloth, leaving only the fibers and the brain membrane. (2) Use disease-free, fresh, transparent pig gallbladders (regardless of the number), filter out the bile juice using gauze (discard the gallbladder), sixty to seventy CC. (3) Bitter clove, dried tangerine peel, thirty CC each. (4) Add one hundred CC of sugar syrup (to prevent spoilage, you can add saccharin or omit sugar). (5) Add one hundred CC of wine (in hot weather, you can add up to one hundred and fifty CC). People who cannot consume alcohol can add less wine, or no wine at all, replacing the corresponding amount of wine with water. Those who can consume alcohol can add more wine, or use only wine without adding water, because it easily spoils in summer. If water is added, it should be prepared and consumed immediately, and can only be preserved for two to three days. After adding wine, it can be preserved for one week. (6) In addition to the above-specified quantities of medicines, add water to make one pound in total.
    Dosage: Ten to fifteen CC after each meal, avoid tea and acidic substances, pay attention to preservation, store in a cool, dark place, do not heat or expose to heat, do not expose to sunlight.
    Recently, comrades suffering from spermatorrhea have tried this medicine. After six to seven days, the penis and testicles swell, as if semen is about to flow out before taking the medicine. At this time, there is only swelling without spermatorrhea. After three or four days, this effect disappears. We hope that those who take the medicine pay attention and do not consider it a side effect and dare not continue to use it.

　　补脑汁详细制法
    本报前刊载×纵××旅卫生处发明补脑汁消息，读者纷纷来函询问详细装法，兹经该部详细答复，特予刊载，以飨读者。
    【荷泽十三日电】××旅卫生处发明补脑汁配装法：
    （一）用新鲜无病生猪脑子一个至两个，加酒五六十ＣＣ，搅拌极碎如粥状，用细布滤出脑汁一百二十三ＣＣ，光剩下纤维和脑子的皮膜。（二）无病新鲜透明猪胆，（不分几个）用纱布滤出胆汁，（不要胆）六七十ＣＣ。（三）苦味丁、陈皮丁各三十ＣＣ。（四）加糖浆一百ＣＣ（为了防止腐败，可加糖精或不放糖）（五）加酒一百ＣＣ（现在天热加至一百五十ＣＣ亦可），不能吃酒的人可少加酒，或不加酒，按应加酒量改加水。能吃酒的可多加酒，或光用酒不放水，因为夏天容易坏。如加水，只能临时配临时吃，只能保存两三天。加酒后可保存一个礼拜。（六）除以上规定药品数量外，其余加水成一磅量。
    服法：每饭后服十至十五ＣＣ，忌茶及酸类，注意保存，要放在冷暗处，勿加温受热，勿见日光。
    近经患遗精症的同志试服此药六七天后，阴茎及睾丸发涨，如在不服药前即要流出精液，此时光发涨不遗精，经过三四天后，即没有此作用了。希服者注意，勿认为是附作用，不敢继续用下去。
