　　U.S. Commerce Department Officials Arrive in Soviet Union
    Discussing Trade Issues Between the Two Countries
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th] Reuter reports: Two U.S. Commerce Department officials arrived in Moscow on the 7th to present to the Soviet government Secretary of Commerce Wallace's proposal to stabilize import and export trade between the two countries. The two officials are Rosens, Director of the Soviet Division of the Commerce Department, and Rowen, an economist at the department. The two will stay in Moscow for two months. The two said that regardless of the prospects of the U.S. loan proposal, trade between the two countries will continue. It is reported that trade between the two countries may reach 500 million yuan per year until 1950.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th] Washington News: The new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Novikov, recently stated when meeting with a Reuters reporter that the Soviet Union will never launch a war against the United States or any other country. He also said: He knows that the American people do not want to fight against any country. Novikov continued: "In any case, there is no basis for a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although there are major differences of opinion among the major powers at this time, they can be coordinated. It will still take time and patience to resolve these controversial issues." In his conversation, Novikov also pointed out that the United States, along with Britain and France, had failed to fulfill the reparations clauses related to Germany in the Potsdam Agreement, so the shipment of goods from western Germany to the Soviet Union had ceased.

　　美商务部官员抵苏
    商谈两国贸易问题
    【新华社延安八日电】美联社报导：美商务部官员两人，于七日抵达莫斯科，向苏联政府呈递美商务部长华莱士稳定两国出入口贸易之建议。两位官员为商务部苏联司司长罗善斯，及该部之经济学家罗文。两氏将在苏京逗留二月。两氏称：不管美贷款建议前途如何，两国间之贸易将继续进行。据息：两国间贸易或将每年为五亿元，直至一九五○年。
    【新华社延安六日电】华盛顿讯：新任苏驻美大使诺维科夫顷于接见美联社记者时称：苏联将永不对美或其他任何国家发动战争。并谓：他深知美国人民不愿对任何国家作战。诺氏继称：“无论如何美苏间之战争实无任何根据，此时强国间虽有主要意见之分歧，但可能予以协调。在解决这些意见纷纭之问题时，尚需时间及忍耐力”。诺氏在谈话中，并指出美国连同英、法未予履行波茨顿协定中有关德国之赔偿事项，是以自德国西部运往苏联之货物，已告停止。
