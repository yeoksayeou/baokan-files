　　Bearing the Oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's Brutal Tyranny
　　Fleeing Landlords Return One After Another
    You Don't Have to Know Goods, Just Be Afraid of Comparing Goods.
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] In order to carry out a large-scale civil war, the Kuomintang reactionaries' secret service organs have carried out special agent training on a large number of fleeing landlords. After the training, they organized "Homecoming Teams" to sneak into our liberated areas to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities, which is worthy of vigilance in various places. However, there are also many fleeing landlords who, because they fled to the Kuomintang-controlled areas, suffered the harsh abuse of the Chiang regime and could not live in peace, and felt that our liberated areas were good and returned.
    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency in Huaiyin on the 7th: A small number of landlords in the Central China Liberated Area who were incited and unwilling to reduce rents in accordance with the law fled to Shanghai, Yangzhou and other places. Because they could not bear the oppression of the Kuomintang authorities' tyranny, they have returned one after another. Ding Wenxian, a landlord in the Xintan District of Sheyang who had just returned from Shanghai, said: "I have personally seen landlords who fled to Shanghai pushing tiger carts to transport stones, sweeping garbage, selling tea, and even begging for food. They cannot maintain their lives. After careful consideration, the liberated area is still good; I will return first, and they will also return." Liu Zhengjing, a landlord in Liuzhuang Village, Mitandi District, Fudong, returned with his four sons after stopping in Shanghai for fifty days. In addition to running out of the money they brought with them, they also owed more than 700,000 yuan in food expenses. According to Gu Zhenghou, a landlord in Tongyang District, Sheyang, who returned from Shanghai in late last month: "Several landlords fled to Zhenjiang and were escorted by the Kuomintang army. Their property was robbed, and they were also imprisoned there." Chen Wenxiang, a landlord in Dizhuang Village, Mitandi District, Fudong, who took more than one million yuan to Yangzhou to set up a small stall, ate up his capital in less than two months and returned to the liberated area to admit his mistakes to the democratic government and automatically asked his tenants to reduce rent in accordance with the law. Xu Mutao, a large landlord in Sheyang, realized from his painful experience of fleeing to the Kuomintang area that the liberated area was better. After returning home, he voluntarily gave many hidden bullets and a rifle to the militia to defend his hometown. Zuo Xiaoting, a landlord in Caiqiao District, Fudong, fled back from Jiangnan and said angrily: "In the Kuomintang area, you have to buy a route to walk, otherwise big labels such as "traitor", "communist bandit", and "bandit detective" will be put on your head. As the saying goes: "You don't have to know goods, just be afraid of comparing goods." When I was treated badly by the Kuomintang reactionaries, I thought of the New Fourth Army at home! After returning home, the democratic government still took care of me as before, helping me settle down and live, and I am determined to live a happy life in the liberated area in the future, and I will never be indecisive again."

　　不堪蒋家暴政欺压
　  逃亡地主纷纷归来
    不怕不识货，只怕货比货。
    【本报特讯】国民党反动派特务机关为进行大规模内战，把大批逃亡地主，施行特务训练后，组织“还乡队”潜入我解放区，进行种种阴谋破坏活动，值得各地警惕。但也有不少逃亡地主，因逃至国民党统治区，亲受蒋政权苛虐，无法安生，觉得我解放区好而归来者。
    据新华社淮阴七日电：受人煽惑不愿依法减租而逃亡上海、扬州等地之华中解放区少数地主，因不堪国民党当局暴政压迫，已纷纷归来。新从上海回来的射阳新坍区地主丁文先说：“亲见逃往上海的地主有推老虎车运石头的，有扫垃圾的，有卖茶水的，还有讨饭的，生活都无法维持。仔细想来还是解放区好；我先回来了，他们也要回来的。”阜东糜滩区刘庄村地主刘正经，父子四人在上海停了五十天后回来了，除用光携带去的钱财外，还亏欠饭食费七十多万元。据上月下旬从上海回来之射阳通洋区地主顾正侯谈：“有几个地主逃到镇江，被国民党军队押着，财物抢光不算，还在那里坐牢。”带了百多万元遛到扬州摆小摊的阜东糜滩区堤庄村地主陈文祥，不到两个月把本钱吃光，又回到解放区向民主政府认错，自动找佃户依法减租。射阳大地主徐慕陶，从逃亡国民党地区痛苦经历中体验到还是解放区好，回家后把私藏的许多子弹和一支步枪，自动献给民兵保卫家乡。阜东蔡桥区地主左筱亭从江南逃回来愤恨地说：“在国民党地区走路都得用买路线，否则“汉奸”、“通匪”、“匪探子”等大帽子就都套上头来了。常言道：“不怕不识货，只怕货比货”。当我受到国民党反动派的虐待时，我就想起家里的新四军来了！回家后民主政府对我还是一样照顾，帮助安家生活，今后决心在解放区过安乐的日子，再不三心二意了。”
