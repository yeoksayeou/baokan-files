    Early in the morning on June 9th, I returned to my lovely hometown—Zhenghe. Piles of wheat straw by the village, rows of new houses on the street, the morning sun shining on my eyes, for a moment I almost couldn't believe that this was the home that had been reduced to ruins by the enemy and puppet regime.
    Zhenghe has changed. This year, there are three thousand mu of wheat fields, yielding 300,000 jin of wheat, averaging 150 jin per person. The least was harvested by Min Xiao Si and a loafer, Min Xiao Si only harvested 100 jin. They had been driven off their land by the landlord for twenty years, and now for the first time, they harvested wheat from their own land. The new rich peasant Wu Yingjie harvested 2,500 jin of wheat this year, and people say he is the Wu Manyou of our village.
    This year's wheat harvest saw every household voluntarily form groups. Starting from the 3rd, in just five short days, all the wheat was brought home. Now the spinning wheels and looms are humming again, and the men are taking up their hoes to go to the fields to weed the seedlings.
    Poor peasant Wu Sanwei remembered that twenty-four years ago, he harvested 100 jin of wheat and gave it all to the landlord. Now he harvests several times more but can carry it all home. He smiled at me and said, "This year, every family has wheat, and everyone is happy."
                                                    June 15th, in Weixian.

　　故乡
　　英林
    六月九号清早，我回到我可爱的故乡——郑河。村边一堆堆麦柴，街上一幢幢的新房，朝阳耀射着我的眼睛，一时我几乎不敢确认这就是曾被敌伪弄的颓垣断壁的家。
    郑河变了，今年麦田三千亩，收麦三十万斤，每人合一百五十斤，收得最少的是闵小四和一个二流子，闵小四只收一百斤。他们是被地主驱离自己的土地已二十年了，如今第一次又从自己土地上收回麦子。新富农武英杰今年收麦二千五百斤，人们都说他是俺村的吴满有。
    今年麦收，家家户户都自愿结成小组，从三号开始，短短的五天就把麦都收到了家。现在纺花机织布机又响了，男人们也都拿上锄头上地锄苗。
    贫农武三位想起二十四年他收一百斤麦，全都交给了地主，现在比那多了好几倍却都扛到自己家里，他对我笑了，他说：“今年家家进麦，人人快乐。”
                                                    六、十五于威县。
