　　Yan Xishan Disregards the Military Mediation Department's Orders
    Continues to Attack Our Liberated Areas
    The Situation on the East Qin Line Becomes More Tense
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 11th] After the Peiping Executive Headquarters issued an order on July 1st to cease military conflict in Shanxi Province, Yan Xishan's troops continued to actively attack the Yuci-Tai (Gu) Liberated Area in the Second Military Sub-district of Taihang. The war has now expanded to the East Qin section of the Baijin Line. Yan's troops have now concentrated seven regiments of troops on this line, commanded by Zhao Chengshui. From the 7th, Yan's troops in Qin County, Nanguan, and Laiyuan began to attack our troops stationed in Beiguan from both sides. In the afternoon, a regiment of the 44th Division of Yan's troops stationed in Taigu City also moved to Nantuanbai on the East Qin Line to reinforce them. On the same day, more than 400 Yan's troops from Dongyang, Taigu, escorted by three trucks loaded with ammunition, increased to Fancun, preparing to attack us. Yan's troops in Yangyi, in that county, also occupied Dongli on the same day, and cooperated with Xiao Bai's Yan's troops to continue attacking Baiyan, where fierce fighting occurred with our troops. At the same time, 500 Yan's troops from Beiadong and Ludouwan in Taigu, on the morning of the 7th, invaded our Nanbei Zhaocun, Shagouli and other places, and were resolutely resisted by our local troops, killing more than 40 invading soldiers and capturing more than ten. Yan's troops, having suffered heavy losses, are now transferring a large number of reinforcements from Taigu, Yuci and other places, and the situation in East Qin Song is becoming more tense.
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 11th] The puppet troops of Gaotang, in coordination with Kuomintang aircraft bombing, invaded our Wulipu, Xuguantun, Niuguantun and other places. In order to protect the local peaceful residents, our army disarmed the puppet troops of Wulipu at 10:00 p.m. on the 6th, killing two puppet company commanders and capturing more than 100 puppet deputy battalion commanders and below, seizing seven machine guns and more than 100 rifles. When our army attacked Wulipu, more than 1,000 puppet troops from Xuguantun and Niuguantun reinforced them, but were resolutely repelled by us. The puppet troops fled in two directions. The one fleeing east was completely annihilated by our Bohai troops; our troops are pursuing the one fleeing north. The above three places were completely liberated at 12:00 p.m. that night.
