　　【Report from our Changzhi Office】At dawn on the 5th, the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the puppet Duan Bingchang's troops, entrenched in Nanguan Town (belonging to Wuxiang) on the eastern Qin line, along with the puppet police brigade, totaling more than 150 people, raided Hebei and Xinyi villages in Wuxiang. In order to protect the interests of the people and avenge the Qingxu massacre, our army rose up in self-defense. After half an hour of fighting, the puppet troops were completely defeated, and more than half were annihilated. A total of 40 puppet soldiers including the puppet company commander were killed, two machine guns, 36 rifles and other military supplies were captured. The local people were extremely excited. After the battle, they immediately beat drums and gongs to show their appreciation to our army.
