Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th. Two hundred thousand people from all walks of life in Songhua and Harbin gathered in an unprecedented grand meeting at Zhaolin Park in this city on the 7th, to commemorate the first "July 7th Incident" after the victory of the War of Resistance. From morning till night, the city was filled with crowds and non-stop singing. The main streets were plastered with various slogans and cartoons. The propaganda department of the Democratic Allied Forces' 20th unit exhibited to tens of thousands of people various photos of our liberated area's military and civilians in eight years of bloody resistance against Japan, as well as a large number of Japanese and American weapons seized in previous battles. At 8 a.m., the lawns of Zhaolin Park, stretching for miles around, were packed with attendees. The voices of commemoration of the "July 7th Incident" and opposition to civil war reverberated throughout the venue. The Yangko team of the 20th unit performed various programs before the meeting, profoundly exposing the crimes of the Sino-American reactionaries in colluding to seize the fruits of the people's War of Resistance. At around 10 a.m., the conference solemnly began with the majestic sounds of the "March of Democracy." After a moment of silence in tribute to the fallen soldiers of the War of Resistance, Mayor Liu Dong delivered the opening speech, saying: "In the past eight years, we could only silently pray in our hearts on this day. Now, although the War of Resistance has been won, the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialist elements are attempting to oppress the people and launch a large-scale civil war. Today, as we commemorate the ninth anniversary of the 'July 7th Incident,' all compatriots in Songhua must unite and fight to the end for the independence, peace, and democracy of the Chinese nation." Feng Zhongyun, Chairman of Songjiang Province, proposed renaming Daowai Zhengyang Street as "Jingyu Street" and Daoli Zucheng Street as "Shangzhi Street" to commemorate the immortal deeds of national heroes such as Yang Jingyu and Zhao Shangzhi, commanders of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army. A representative of the Democratic Allied Forces spoke, emphasizing that the Democratic Allied Forces are fighting for China's peace, democracy, independence, and freedom, and for safeguarding the free and happy lives of the people of Northeast China. Mr. Xie Yuchang of the Peace and Democracy Promotion Association, Mr. Li Guojun of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Mr. He Zhian of the financial sector, Ms. Kong Huanwen, a representative of the women's sector, and student representatives from the cultural sector also spoke, unanimously expressing their firm opposition to civil war, opposition to American interference in China's internal affairs, and demanding that the United States immediately withdraw from China. Ms. Kong Huanwen, a representative of the women's sector, especially called on women compatriots from all walks of life in Songhua to unite and support the heroic actions of 50,000 students in Shanghai in opposing civil war. After the conference passed a telegram to all sectors of the country, it set off on a parade to the majestic singing of the "Yellow River Cantata."
