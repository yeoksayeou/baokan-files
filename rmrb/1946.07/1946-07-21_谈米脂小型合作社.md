　　Talking about Small Cooperatives in Mizhi
　　Bing Fang

　　In February of this year, Comrades Hao Fengtian and Wang Yaode, deputy section chiefs of the Cooperative Section of the Border Region Government's Construction Department, made a special trip to Mizhi to investigate the small cooperatives in Minfeng and Yindou districts. This trip back to Yan'an brought them confidence, as they saw cooperatives there that were truly run by the masses and suited to the needs of the masses.

　　During their investigation, they examined seventeen small cooperatives, most of which were grain credit cooperatives, some also engaged in production and consumption cooperation. These cooperatives were scattered throughout the villages, playing their due role.

　　To start with what the local people urgently needed and what was easiest to manage, this was pointed out in the Mizhi County Committee's research on cooperative issues in 1944. What did the people of Mizhi need most urgently at that time?

　　Mizhi has little land but a large population, and grain is often insufficient. Many people often need to borrow grain during the period between harvests. Through the farmers' own grain credit cooperatives, they can avoid exploitation by high-interest loans. For example, Yan Mingcai, a labor hero from Yindou Village, Yindou District, mobilized everyone at the village farmers' association members' meeting in October 1943 to collect grain and establish a credit cooperative. His reason was, "After rent and interest reduction, most landlords are unwilling to lend, and even if one or two people lend, the interest is quite high. In order to solve our own grain shortage, we can collect grain ourselves to run a credit cooperative." At that time, the rent reduction work in the village was done very well, and the members of the farmers' association benefited from the rent reduction. So, on the spot, fifty-three members of the farmers' association collected nine dou and six sheng of millet and seven dou and three sheng of wheat. The interest on their grain loans was only set at three he of rice per dou per month (the interest on general private loans was seven or eight he).

　　Secondly, because land in Mizhi was concentrated, farmers lacked land. After the rent reduction, landlords sold land, but farmers lacked economic power. They then purchased land from landlords through credit cooperatives with collective mutual assistance. Before 1942, Dujiayao Village, Seventh Township, Yindou District, had less than fifty qing of land cultivated by the villagers themselves, and most of the rest was rented. After the rent reduction on the land of landlord Chang Youyi in Shangmiaoshan, Minfeng District, the landlord proposed to sell land. In three years, the farmers in the village bought more than 200 qing of land from the landlord. However, at the same time, because farmers used grain to buy land, it affected their grain supply, making it even more difficult to eat. For example, farmer Du Liangde originally had six qing of land. In the winter of 1944, he bought five qing. In the spring of 1945, he had difficulty eating grain, so he borrowed three dou of wheat and three dou of rice from the cooperative and paid back the principal and interest in full during the summer harvest. In May of the same year, he bought another three qing of land. In July, he had difficulty eating grain, so he borrowed another five dou of wheat and three dou of rice from the cooperative and returned them in full after the autumn harvest. Therefore, Du Liangde not only solved the difficulty of eating grain, but also became more active in production because he had increased his self-cultivated land by eight and a half qing. The credit cooperative played an obvious role in promoting Du Liangde's economic development.

　　In addition, due to the large labor force, cooperatives were needed to organize sideline production. For example, the Jiedi Charcoal Kiln Cooperative in Gaojiaxian Village, Minyan District, organized donkey owners to transport charcoal. For example, Ai Piling in the village fed a donkey with others, but he didn't have the capital to carry charcoal, so he borrowed one and a half dou of rice from the cooperative and solved the problem. The textile training school in Yuanzhishan, Minyun District, received loans from the cooperative as textile capital or to purchase tools. Gao Fulu borrowed more than one shi of grain to carry out family textile production, earning more than one million yuan. The cooperatives in Yindou and Minfeng districts issued and collected more than 3,000 jin of yarn, earning the spinners more than 130 shi of millet in wages.

　　Most small cooperatives solved the economic difficulties of poor households in marriages, funerals, and illnesses. During this year's autumn harvest, the crops were affected by hail, which affected the harvest. Poor members could withdraw their shares or take back dividends to solve the difficulty of eating grain. In this way, it also produced the role of a charitable granary in preparation for famine.

　　These cooperatives were born out of the needs of the masses. Therefore, there was no forced subscription of shares. They united economically according to their own strength, solved their urgent difficulties, and reduced the exploitation of intermediaries.

　　"We must adhere to and implement the policy of having the masses run, for the masses, and let the masses handle things freely," this was also the opinion of the Mizhi County Committee on the cooperative policy in 1944. More than a year of experience has proved that the masses are most likely to grasp democratic rights in their own economic organizations, and only by promoting democracy can cooperatives be run well. These small cooperatives are the most closely linked to the economic interests of the working masses.

　　When running a cooperative, the masses elect people they know and trust to be in charge. The elected cooperative cadres are also most likely to understand the needs of the masses in their village, and they can wholeheartedly serve the people of their village. At the same time, the masses can easily directly supervise the bad behavior of the cooperative cadres.

　　The cooperative's business operations, such as the interest rate, term, and object of deposits and loans, can be directly democratically discussed by the members. For example, the Farmers' Association Cooperative in Yindou Village had no experience when it started lending in February 1944. It only relied on individual oral reports to issue loans. People who knew early were able to borrow, and the number of loans was not specified. Only six people were lent to, and the amount of grain stored was very small. People who came later were unable to borrow, so it was announced that lending would be suspended. In May, all the loans were recovered, and a meeting of members (non-members also participated) was held to discuss the lending method. First, the members who needed to borrow grain registered the amount of grain they needed to borrow. Everyone decided whether each person should borrow or how much to borrow based on the amount of grain stored by the cooperative and the economic situation of the borrowing households. In addition, matters such as the term, interest rate, and procedures were also discussed and implemented by everyone.

　　In such democratic and free economic cooperation, cadres who are honest and serve the public are cultivated. They can more specifically understand the needs of the masses, better serve the masses, and become a functioning link in the economic life of the people of Mizhi. They do not pay attention to formal extravagance, but do as much as they can with the strength they have, and at the same time make the masses more directly and deeply aware of the benefits of the cooperative to them.

　　However, the development of small cooperatives in Mizhi has also had biases and shortcomings. In the initial stage of widespread development in 1944, there were a total of 137 small rural cooperatives in Mizhi, mostly concentrated in the Minfeng and Yindou districts. There were even several types of cooperatives in one village, such as farmers' associations, women's associations, and children's associations, which made the strength too dispersed to accomplish anything. Some places also had the phenomenon of apportioning shares, and some share collections had not yet decided what business to conduct. In general, due to the weak initial foundation and lack of experience, many shortcomings were inevitably produced. For example, last year, the leadership was somewhat laissez-faire, and many small cooperatives gradually declined in self-reliance.

　　During this investigation, several issues that urgently need to be improved were also discovered. For example: some speculative merchants and bad landlords participated in the cooperative cadres, resulting in corruption and illegal phenomena, lacking the concept of serving the masses; the treatment of cadres was unbalanced, "doing well is not rewarded, and doing badly is not punished," making some people unwilling to take office; some cooperatives themselves run factories but do not organize mass production, resulting in losses for the cooperative and no service to the masses; in general, there is a lack of good rules and regulations, and the cooperative does not have public welfare funds, which affects its establishment of a long-term foundation. In future development, in addition to the guidance and assistance from various administrative levels, there is a greater need for larger cooperatives from the bottom up to establish contact with various small cooperatives in terms of business and help organize plans.

　　谈米脂小型合作社
    冰方
    今年二月间，边府建设厅合作科副科长郝丰田和王耀德两同志，专门到米脂调查民丰、印斗两区的小型合作社，这次回延给他们带来了信心，他们在那里看到了真正是群众自己所办适合群众要求的合作社。
    这次他们在那里共调查了十七个小型的合作社，那些合作社大多是粮食信用合作，其中也有兼营生产与消费合作，它们分散在各个村庄里起着他们应有的作用。
    根据当地老百姓最迫切需要的也是最容易办好的来办，这是四四年米脂县委关于合作社问题的研究时就指出的。当时米脂老百姓最迫切需要的是什么呢？
    米脂地少人多，粮食不足，许多人往往在青黄不接时需要借粮，而通过农民自己的粮食信用合作社，即可避免高利贷的剥削。比如印斗区一乡印斗村的劳动英雄阎明彩，四三年十月在村农会会员大会上发动大家集粮，成立信用合作社。他提出的理由是“减租减息以后一般地主都不愿意放账，即使有一两人放账，利息相当大，我们为了解决自己的吃粮困难，我们可以自己来集粮办信用合作社”。当时该村的减租工作做得很好，农会会员都得了减租的利益，于是当场就你三升我五升的，五十三户农会会员就集合了九斗六升小米和七斗三升麦子。他们借粮的利息只规定每月每斗为三合米（一般的私人放款利息为七、八合）。
    其次由于米脂土地集中，农民缺乏土地，减租后地主出卖土地，但农民经济力量不足，他们便通过信用合作在集体互助下向地主购买土地。印斗区七乡杜家崖窑村，在四二年以前全村自种地不到五十垧，其余大多是租种；民丰区商庙山地主常有义的地减租后，地主即提出要卖地，三年中该村农民向地主买进土地二百多垧。但同时由于农民以粮食买地就影响了吃粮更加困难，比如农民杜良德原有六垧地，四四年冬买了五垧，四五年春吃粮食困难了，向合作社借了三斗麦子三斗米，夏收时本利还清；同年五月他又买了三垧地，到七月吃粮困难，又向合作社借了五斗麦三斗米，秋收后如数归还。因此杜良德不仅解决了吃粮困难，而且更由于增加了八垧半自耕地而更加积极地生产了，信用合作社给予杜良德的经济发展起了明显的推动作用。
    此外，因劳力多，需要合作社组织副业生产，如民盐区高家险村接底炭窑合作社，就组织有驴户贩炭。比如该村艾丕令和别人伙喂一头驴，要驮炭没本钱，向合作社借了一斗半米后就解决了问题。民郧区远志山的纺织传习所，由合作社放款作纺织资本或购买工具，高福禄借粮一石多进行家庭纺织，获利一百多万元。印斗民丰两区社发花收纱共达三千多斤，给纺妇们赚了一百三十多石小米工资。
    多数小型合作社为穷户解决了婚丧疾病中的经济困难，本年秋收时因庄稼被冷子侵袭而影响收成，贫穷社员即可抽股或取回红利以解决吃粮困难，如此它又产生着备荒中的义仓作用。
    那些合作社在群众需要中产生，因此，它没有强迫摊派入股的现象，它们根据自己的力量，从经济上团结起来，为自己解决着迫切的困难，减少了中间人的剥削。
    “要坚持和贯彻由群众办、为群众办、让群众放手办的方针”，这也是四四年米脂县委关于合作社方针的意见。一年多来的经验证明，群众在他们自己的经济组织中是最会掌握民主权利，也只有发扬民主才能办好合作社，而这些小型合作社正是最密切联系着劳动群众的经济利益。
    办合作社时群众选举出自己所熟悉而信任的人来负责；被选的合作社干部，也最容易了解本村群众的需要，他们能够忠心耿耿的为本村人民服务。同时群众又容易直接监督着合作社干部的不良行为。
    合作社的举办业务，存放款的利息、期限、对象等，都可以直接由社员们民主公议，比如印斗村的农会合作社，于四四年二月间开始放款时没有经验，只凭个别的口头传说就发放，知道早的人就借到，借粮数也没有规定，只放了六个人，存粮就很少了，后来的人没有借到，于是就宣布停放。五月间将放粮全部收回，并召开社员大会（非社员亦有参加），讨论放粮办法，先由需要借粮的社员报名借粮数，由大家根据合作社存粮多少和借粮户的经济情况决定，每个人应否借或借多少。此外，如期限、利息、手续等也经大家议决遵照执行。
    在这样民主自由的经济合作中，培养了廉洁为公的干部，他们能够更加具体了解群众的需要，更好的为群众服务，成为米脂人民经济生活中起作用的一环。它们不讲究形式的铺张，实事求是的有多少力量做多少事，同时也使群众更加直接地深切体会到合作社对他们的利益。
    但是米脂小型合作社的发展也曾经产生过偏向和缺点，在四四年广泛发展的初期，米脂小型的乡村合作社共达一百三十七个，大多集中在民丰、印斗两区，甚至一个村里有农会的、妇女的、儿童的几种合作社，使力量过于分散而办不成事；有的地方也有摊派股金现象，有的集股还没有决定举办什么业务；而一般的因开始初办基础薄弱，缺乏经验，不免产生很多缺点；又如去年领导上有些放任自流，许多小型合作社便在自生自灭中渐趋消沉。
    在这次调查过程中，也发现急待改进的几个问题，比如：合作社干部中由于个别投机商人和不良地主的参加而发生贪污违法等现象，没有服务群众的观点；干部待遇不平衡，“作好不奖，作坏不罚”，使有些人不愿意任职；有的合作社本身办工厂而不组织群众生产，结果合作社赔本，又没有为群众服务；一般的都缺少很好的制度章程，合作社没有公积金公益金，因而影响它建立长远的基础。而在今后发展中，除了各级行政上的指导和帮助外，更需要有自下而上的比较大的合作社，在业务上和各小型合作社取得联系和帮助组织计划。
