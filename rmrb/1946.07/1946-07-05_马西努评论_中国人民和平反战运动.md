Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd: Commentator Masinu stated in a Moscow broadcast today that Chinese and foreign newspapers unanimously point out that the struggle of progressive people from all walks of life in China for peace and against civil war has been strengthened. Since the Chinese Anti-Japanese National United Front movement, there has not been such a broad mass movement as the current one. This movement, which occurred at the end of May, has developed to a nationwide scope. In Shanghai and other places, there are 54 kinds of people's organizations against the civil war movement, including the famous National Salvation Association, the Shanghai branch of the Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and democrats within the Kuomintang. More than 100,000 people in Shanghai participated in the movement to strive for peace and oppose civil war, including workers, merchants, farmers, students, professors, writers, and journalists, a wide range of people from all walks of life. The Shanghai people's delegation that went to Nanjing on June 23 to petition was composed of representatives from all walks of life, including educator Ma Xulun, Wu University professor Lei Jieqiong, and industrialist Hu Juewen. Therefore, foreign reporters believe that China's peace movement has become a national movement. It is not the first time in China that the broad masses of people have risen up to save the country in times of national crisis. This phenomenon is increasingly strengthening the people's movement today. The extension of the ceasefire period is a manifestation of this movement.

Who is hindering peace in China?

Foreign reporters in Shanghai cited reliable sources as saying that the Kuomintang's reactionary generals and officers are preparing to wage an anti-Communist war. They have prepared to the point that they are eager to start the attack. Representatives of Shanghai people's organizations have stated to reporters that the Kuomintang reactionaries in the Nanjing government are supporting the civil war with all their might, because they can only seize power under such conditions.

Chinese newspapers pointed out that the Kuomintang's reactionary rule has been particularly strengthened recently. In major cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, and Nanjing, Kuomintang terrorists, secret agents, and detectives have committed many assassinations. Advanced people who demand an end to the civil war and demand the establishment of peace have become their victims.

On June 23, the Kuomintang reactionaries attacked and beat the Shanghai people's representatives who went to Nanjing to petition, and Chinese democrats expressed great indignation at this fact. They pointed out that the Kuomintang reactionaries' arrogance is by no means a sign of their strength; on the contrary, recent events particularly clearly demonstrate the political and military weakness of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Chinese democrats particularly pointed out that the Chinese reactionaries do not have sufficient strength domestically, and if they lose foreign aid, they would never dare to come out against democracy at any time. Estimating this situation, one can understand that the movement to strive for peace is closely linked with two demands from the beginning: to demand an end to the civil war and at the same time to demand that foreigners not interfere in China's internal affairs.

According to foreign newspapers, this kind of interference has been particularly widespread in the past two weeks. The China Weekly Review published an editorial in mid-June, expressing extreme suspicion about the characteristics of the United States' policy toward China, which has not been seen at any time. The reporter pointed out that Senator Bernays' military aid to China bill to Congress would help train one million Chinese troops. In this way, the United States completely abandoned the facade of neutrality in the Chinese civil war. The United States has long disregarded even superficial neutrality. According to the reporter, Truman's request to Congress to pass the military aid to China bill during the critical period of the Nanjing KMT-CPC negotiations was a means of seizing China. The reporter concluded: If the Chinese war expands further, not only Nanjing should be responsible, but Washington should also be responsible.

Recently, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, issued a statement on this issue, expressing resolute opposition to the United States' military assistance to China. Shanghai news circles pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement represents the demands of the broad masses of the Chinese people.

    中国人民和平反战运动
    【新华社延安二日电】莫斯科今日广播，评论员马西努称：中外报纸都一致指出，中国各阶层进步人士为争取和平反对内战的斗争，已经加强起来。自从中国抗日民族统一战线运动以来，还没有看到过像现在这样广泛的群众运动。在五月底所发生的这一运动，已发展到全国范围，上海等地反对内战运动的民众组织有五十四种，其中包括有名的救国会组织、民主同盟上海分会、民主促进会、及国民党内的民主派。上海争取和平反对内战运动有十余万人参加，包括工人、商人、农民、学生、教授、作家、与新闻记者，广泛的各阶层的人。六月二十三日赴南京请愿的上海民众代表团，即是由各阶层人士代表所组成。其中有教育家马叙伦，吴大学女教授雷洁琼、工业家胡厥文。所以外国记者认为，中国的和平运动已成为全民运动。当中国民族危急时期广大民众奋起救国，这在中国是不只一次的现象了。这一现象在今天日益加强了民众运动。停战时期的延长，就是这一运动的表现。
    是谁阻碍中国的和平呢？
    上海的外国记者引据可靠方面消息，国民党的反动将军与军官准备进行反共战争。他们已准备到这样地步，以致于急于开始进攻。上海民众团体代表曾向记者声明说，南京政府内的国民党反动派用一切力量支持内战，因为他们只有在这种条件下，才能取得政权。
    中国报纸指出国民党反动统治，在最近时期特别加强活动。在重庆、成都、南京等各大城市，国民党恐怖分子、特务、暗探干出不少暗杀事件。要求停止内战，要求树立和平的先进人士，便成为他们的牺牲者。
    六月二十三日国民党反动派进攻、毒打晋京请愿的上海民众代表，中国民主人士对于这一事实表示极大愤恨。他们指出国民党反动派的猖狂，绝不是他们力量的强大；相反的，最近的事件特别明显的证明国民党反动派政治军事的薄弱。中国民主人士特别指出，中国反动派在国内没有足够的力量，如果他们失去外援，则在任何时候也不敢出头反对民主。估计到这一种情况，就可以了解争取和平的运动一开始，就与两种要求密切连系，要求停止内战与同时要求外人不要干涉中国内政。
    据外国报纸指出，这种干涉在最近两星期具有特别广泛的性质。密勒氏评论在六月中旬发表过一篇社论，对于美国对华政策的特点，表示极端怀疑，这是任何时期没有看到过的。记者指出贝纳斯向国会提出的军事援华法案，帮助训练中国一百万军队。这样一来，美国就完全放弃了在中国内战中之中立的假面具。美国早已不顾及甚至是表面的中立了。据记者指出，杜鲁门利用南京国共谈判危急时期，要求国会通过军事援华法案，是夺取中国的手段。该记者结论说：如果中国战争更扩大的话，不仅是南京应当负责，而且华盛顿也要负责。
    最近中共中央委员会主席毛泽东，关于这一问题曾发表声明，表示坚决反对美国在军事上帮助中国。上海新闻界指出，毛主席的声明是代表中国广大民众的要求。
