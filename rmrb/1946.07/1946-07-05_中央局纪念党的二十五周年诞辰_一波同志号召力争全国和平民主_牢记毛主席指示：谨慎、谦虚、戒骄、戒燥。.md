[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Party's founding. On "July 1st," a commemorative meeting was held in the Bianqu (Border Region) Conference Hall in Handan. More than a thousand Party member cadres and non-Party cadres invited from directly subordinate organizations of the Central Committee, military organizations, and various organs and groups in Handan all rushed to attend the meeting. The corridors on both sides of the hall were already full early on. Before the meeting, people inquired about the current situation, expressing extreme indignation at the Kuomintang's heinous crimes in attacking the Central Plains Military Region. Tense and excited conversations filled every corner. The meeting began at 4:30 PM. After a solemn ceremony, Comrade Bo Yibo delivered a speech. He first briefly narrated the Party's history of struggle, pointing out that the Party had participated in and led China's revolutionary struggle from its inception. The three major revolutions—the Great Revolution, the Ten-Year Civil War, and the Eight-Year War of Resistance—had greatly trained and tested the Party. With the sacrifices and struggles of all Party comrades and the support of the people, the Party had grown and become a great force with decisive significance in national politics. From its birth and early years, the Party had taken heroism as its glorious characteristic. But now, the Party was not only heroic but also intelligent, mastering rich experience in struggle, and having the wise leader Comrade Mao Zedong. With the whole Party advancing under his banner, we will certainly overcome difficulties and achieve victory.

Comrade Bo Yibo reviewed the Party's historical lessons. After each development, some comrades, overwhelmed by victory, often caused the Party to suffer unnecessary losses. He cautioned everyone that as the Party is unprecedentedly strong today, we must remember Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions: "Be prudent, modest, guard against complacency and impetuosity." Comrade Bo Yibo instructed everyone to deeply recognize the protracted nature of the Chinese revolution, to diligently study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to improve themselves, and to prepare for the future. He finally stated: Due to the erroneous assistance of the United States to the Kuomintang reactionaries, the current situation is very tense. A complex and severe struggle is already before us. The whole Party must be vigilant, neither slackening nor becoming impatient, but intensifying our work to strive for the true realization of national peace and democracy.

　　中央局纪念党的二十五周年诞辰
    一波同志号召力争全国和平民主
    牢记毛主席指示：谨慎、谦虚、戒骄、戒燥。
    【本报特讯】中共晋冀鲁豫中央局为庆祝党的二十五周年诞辰、于“七一”假邯郸边区会议党召开纪念大会。中直、军直、直，邯各机关团体党员干部与被邀请的非党干部千余人，均争先赴会，礼堂两边的走廊上很早即告人满。会前人们纷纷探询时局消息，对于国民党进攻中原军区的滔天罪行，表现了极度的愤恨，紧张兴奋的谈话，充满着每个角落。四时半开会，举行严肃的仪式后，薄一波同志即度讲话。他首先简要叙述了党的斗争历史，指出党从诞生开始就参加与领导了中国的革命斗争。大革命、十年内战、八年抗战这三次大革命，使党得到极大的锻炼和考验，在全党同志的牺牲奋斗和人民的拥护中成长壮大起来，成为在全国政治中有决定意义的伟大力量。党在诞生开始和幼年时期，就以英勇作为自己光荣的特点，但现在，党不仅是英勇的，而且是聪明的，掌握了丰富的斗争经验，有了英明的领袖毛泽东同志。全党在他的旗帜下前进，就一定能战胜困难，取得胜利。
    一波同志检讨党的历史教训，每次发展后由于某些同志被胜利冲昏头脑，常使党遭受不应有的损失，警惕大家在党空前壮大的今天，要牢记毛泽东同志的指示：“谨慎、谦虚、戒骄、戒燥。”一波同志指示大家要深刻认识中国革命的长期性，努力学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，提高自己，准备将来。他最后声称：由于美国对国民党反动派错误的援助，目前形势已非常的紧张，复杂严重的斗争，已摆在我们面前，全党要警惕起来，不松懈也不急燥，加紧工作，争取全国和平民主的真正实现。
