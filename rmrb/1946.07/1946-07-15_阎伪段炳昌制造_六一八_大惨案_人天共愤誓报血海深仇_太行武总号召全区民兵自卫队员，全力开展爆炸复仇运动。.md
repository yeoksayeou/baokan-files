　　Puppet Yan Duan Bingchang Creates "June 18th" Massacre
　  Popular Outrage Demands Vengeance
  　Taihang Military Headquarters Calls on Militia and Self-Defense队员 in the Entire Region to Fully Launch a Bombing Revenge Movement.
    [Reported from Changzhi by this newspaper] Duan Bingchang's puppet Yan army on the Baijin Road in Qin County carried out an inhumane slaughter of peaceful residents in eighteen villages, including Qingxiu and others in Wuxiang, resulting in the "June 18th" massacre that aroused public indignation. On June 8th, Mr. An Dingyuan, an inspector from the Suiyuan-Chahar-Jin International Relief Administration, came from Qin County to the Wuxiang Liberated Area to discuss the transportation of relief supplies. Li Qingyi, a liaison representative from the Yan side, also came along. The people of the tenth district of Wuxiang warmly welcomed them and kept them for several days; unexpectedly, the so-called liaison representative from the Yan side used the name of "liaison" to carry out espionage work. After Li Qingyi returned to Qin County on the 16th, the unprecedented massacre of the people of Wuxiang occurred. On the night of the 17th, Li Qingyi led more than a thousand troops from Duan Bingchang's puppet Yan army in Qin County, Zhangyuan, and Guyi, carrying heavy weapons such as machine guns and artillery, and suddenly surrounded eighteen villages, including Qingxiu and Songcun, in our tenth district. In addition to wounding many people and arresting more than 220 people, and robbing the people of a lot of grain, livestock, and property (the losses of the Qingxiu Village Cooperative alone amounted to hundreds of thousands of yuan), they also used cruel and inhumane tortures that were even more brutal than those of the Japanese invaders, such as cutting genitals, gouging eyes, extracting hearts, cutting off genitals, letting dogs bite open brains, and even inserting wooden sticks from the anus through the mouth, to slaughter 29 of our district and village cadres, militia, and people who had persisted in the War of Resistance for eight years. Not satisfied, the puppet Yan army led more than a thousand troops at dawn on the 26th and attacked villages such as Gucheng and Yaoqu, killing eight village cadres, militia, and people, wounding three, arresting more than 420 people, and robbing five head of cattle. After returning, they hung the heads high on the city of Qin County to flaunt their "victory."
            Taihang Cultural Circles and Mass Organizations Appeal to Just People Around the World
    After the massacre occurred, people everywhere hated it bitterly and demanded that our army lead them to disarm Duan Bingchang's puppet Yan army and hand Duan the traitor over to the people for public trial. The affected villages demanded that more guns and weapons be issued so they could fight the puppet Yan army to the end to avenge this blood feud. An old farmer, Wang Chungui, said: "I have lived for fifty or sixty years, and I have only heard that the King of Hell gouges eyes and cuts tongues in the underworld, but I have never seen people do these things! If these evil ghosts are not wiped out, the people cannot live!" Another farmer said: "In the past, the landlords always told me that Yan Xishan was different from the Japanese and did not harm the people, but now it seems that he harms them even more severely than the Japanese!" The Wuxiang County Government Council, labor, peasant, youth, and women's organizations, and the Military Committee issued a letter to the military and civilians, calling for an urgent uprising for self-defense. The Taihang District Military Committee General Headquarters issued an emergency instruction to the 750,000 militia and self-defense队员 in the entire district, calling on them to support the people of Wuxiang, fully launch a bombing revenge movement, strengthen the self-defense war of militia joint defense, and cooperate with the army to fiercely annihilate the invading puppet Yan army, to liberate the vast people suffering under the bloody rule of the puppet Yan army on the East Qin Line. The Standing Committee of the Border Council Taihang Office, and labor, peasant, youth, women's, and cultural organizations in the Taihang District sent a telegram to the whole country. The Taihang Xinhua Daily also published an article on July 7th appealing to just people across the country and the world, unanimously demanding support for the people of Wuxiang, severely punishing the culprit Yan Xishan, disbanding the puppet army, unconditionally releasing the arrested cadres and people, compensating the people for their losses, and providing pensions to the families of the victims. The leading organs of the Party, government, army, and people in the Taihang District held an emergency meeting on the 6th of this month to organize a joint condolence delegation, carrying many letters of condolence and 50 dan of relief grain and 10,000 yuan of relief funds temporarily allocated by the Administrative Office, as well as 50 rifles, to express condolences and provide relief. The Second Administrative Office and the Wuxiang County Government also sent personnel to investigate and provide relief, and the Jinzhong Public Hospital sent a medical team to treat the injured people. This incident has aroused great vigilance in all border areas of Taihang and has greatly promoted the self-defense movement in the entire district.
