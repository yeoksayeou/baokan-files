　　Amidst the Cheers of a People Seeking Revenge,
    Our Troops Enter Qin County
    Puppet Strongholds Such as Zhangyuan and Niusi are Liberated

[Changzhi, 24th Dispatch] Amidst the cheers of a people seeking revenge, Taihang and Taiyue troops entered Qin County on the morning of the 22nd. Puppet military strongholds north of Qin County, such as Guyi, Zhangyuan, and Niusi, have also been liberated. Qin County is an important town in the northern section of the Baijin Road. The Yan puppet army of Duan Bingchang frequently launched attacks from here against our Taihang and Taiyue liberated areas. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Duan was a notorious traitor who served as the commander of the enemy's First Division of the North China Communist Suppression Army. He also led the enemy in invading Wuxiang, Duan, Panlong and other places, carrying out cruel mopping-up operations in our heartland. In 37 villages of the county alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than 2,000 of our anti-Japanese cadres and masses were brutally killed by this traitor. After the enemy surrendered, Yan Xishan reorganized Duan's troops into the Eighth Division of the Provincial Defense Army, now reorganized as the Third Regiment of the Provisional 46th Division of Yan's 33rd Army, still entrenched in the northern section of Baijin and Qin County, continuing to nibble away at our territory. After the ceasefire order, this puppet became even more rampant, harassing, burning, and killing every day, creating bloody tragedies. In just eight days from the 18th to the 26th of last month, Duan launched two bloody incidents that outraged both humans and gods against more than 20 villages in our Wuxiang Qingxiu and Gucheng, 37 of our rural cadres and militiamen were brutally killed, and 640 people were captured. In response to this blood feud, the military and civilians of the Taihang and Taiyue liberated areas rose up to launch a self-defense and revenge movement, and on the evening of the 21st, recovered Qin County. The results of the battle are still being investigated.

[Reported by this newspaper from Changzhi] The Wuxiang militia's bombing revenge movement, launched to avenge the martyrs of the Qingxiu massacre, has achieved many victories. On the 8th of this month, Duan Bingchang and more than a hundred men robbed more than 40 dan of wheat in Dupo. When they fled back, they were bravely ambushed by the militia regiment of our First District. The puppet army fled in panic and stepped on five landmines planted by the militia, killing two puppet soldiers and wounding ten. All the wheat was recovered. The militia team has also repelled the puppet's grain robbery five times in the past few days. The Humangling militia, who broke through the "June 18th" Qingxiu massacre, are now stepping up training to prepare for revenge and have requested the county military commission to return to the front line to combat the harassment of the Yan puppet army.

　　复仇人民欢呼声中
    我军进驻沁县城
    漳源牛寺等伪据点同获解放
    【长治二十四日电】在复仇人民欢呼声中，太行、太岳我军于二十二日上午进驻沁县城。沁县城北固亦、漳源、牛寺等伪军据点亦同获解放。按沁县为白晋路北段重要城镇，阎伪军段炳昌部即经常由此向我太行、太岳解放区进攻，抗战期间，段逆为投敌著名汉奸，曾任敌华北剿共军第一师师长，并引领敌人侵据武乡段、蟠龙等地，向我腹心地区进行残酷清剿扫荡，仅该县三十七村不完全统计，我抗日干部群众惨遭该逆杀戮者即达两千余人。敌人投降后，阎锡山即将段逆所部收编为省防军第八师，现编为阎军三十三军暂四十六师第三团，仍盘据白晋北段与沁县城，继续向我蚕食。停战令后，该伪更为猖狂，每日均出扰烧杀，制造流血惨案。仅上月十八日至二十六日八天中，段逆即向我武乡青修、故城等二十余村制造两次人天共愤的血案，我农村干部民兵三十七人遭惨杀，抓去群众六百四十人。对此血海深仇，我太行、太岳解放区军民，奋起展开自卫复仇运动，乃于二十一日晚收复沁县城，战果正清查中。
    【本报长治讯】武乡民兵为青修惨案诸烈士复仇而展开之爆炸复仇运动，已获得多次胜利。本月八日段逆炳昌百余人在杜坡抢麦四十余石，回窜时经我一区民兵团英勇伏击，伪军仓惶溃逃，踏响民兵埋设之地雷五个，毙伪军二名，伤十名，麦子全部夺回。该民兵队连日又打退该伪抢粮五次，“六一八”青修惨案突围归来之胡蛮岭民兵，现正加紧锻炼，准备复仇，并已向该县武委会要求重上前线，打击阎伪军的进扰。
