　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Harbin dispatch: The murderers involved in the assassination of General Li Zhaolin, leader of the Northeast People's Self-Defense Army, Kuomintang agents Ma Jianchen and Gao Qing San, have confessed the entire inside story of the case. This assassination was directed by Yan Zhongzhang, commander of the special operations team of the Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau. As early as March 1st, the special agent bandits decided to take advantage of General Li's participation in the speeches of Guan Jiyu (Chairman of the Kuomintang Songjiang Provincial Government) and Yang Chuoan (Mayor of the Kuomintang Harbin City) on that day to assassinate him, but the plan was temporarily changed due to some reason, and the original assassination plan could not be realized. Then, Yan Zhongzhang, He Shiying, and Liu Wensheng secretly discussed that Sun, a female agent of the Military Intelligence Bureau, would pretend to be a leftist and contact General Li Zhaolin for work. On March 9th, she made an excuse to invite Li to Sun Jinghai's house, an agent of the Military Intelligence Bureau, at No. 9 Shuidao, Harbin. First, she poisoned General Li with poisonous water to weaken him. Then, special agent bandits Ma Jianchen, Gao Qing San, Meng Qingyun, etc., who were hiding in Sun's house, came out and killed General Li. Agent Meng Qingyun then searched a letter and a pistol from General Li's body, moved the body behind a coal pile next to the house, and then all fled. In order to cover up the heinous assassination event created single-handedly by Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organs, the Central News Agency first said that this was a private revenge without political overtones, and recently, regardless of self-contradiction, changed its tune to say that it was the CCP who killed him. This absurd denial has now been finally bankrupt.

　　李兆麟将军被害
    是蒋记军统局罪恶
    国特马健臣等供认
    【新华社延安十四日电】哈尔滨讯：参与谋害东北人民自卫军领袖李兆麟将军之凶手、国民党特务马健臣、高庆三两人，已供出此案之全部内幕。此暗杀案，系国民党军统局的别动队长阎钟章所主持。早在三月一日，特务匪徒即决定趁李将军参加该日关吉玉（国民党松江省政府主席），杨绰庵（国民党哈尔滨市市长）讲话会的机会，加以杀害，后因故临时变计，遂致原定暗杀计划未能实现。随即由阎钟章、何士英、刘文升密商，由军统局女特务孙某，伪装左倾面目，与李兆麟将军接洽工作，于三月九日托辞请李至哈市水道九号军统局特务孙镜海家，先饮以毒药水将李将军毒软，暗藏孙宅之特务匪徒马健臣、高庆三、孟庆云等出而将李将军杀害。特务孟庆云复从李将军尸身上搜去信件一封，手枪一支，并将尸体移屋旁煤堆后，始全体逃走。中央社为图掩饰蒋介石特务机关所一手造成的凶恶暗杀事件，先说这是无政治色彩谋报私仇，近又不顾自相矛盾，改口说是中共自己所杀害。此种荒谬的抵赖，现已最后破产。
