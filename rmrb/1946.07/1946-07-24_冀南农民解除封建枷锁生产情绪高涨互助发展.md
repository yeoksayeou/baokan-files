Southern Hebei Peasants Throw Off Feudal Shackles, Production Enthusiasm Soars, Mutual Aid Develops
[This newspaper dispatch] After the peasants in Southern Hebei were freed from feudal exploitation, they organized themselves and became prosperous, and their enthusiasm for production soared to unprecedented levels. According to a report from the Southern Hebei Branch of this newspaper, since this spring in Qiu County, mutual aid groups have grown to 1,280 groups, including 337 rich peasants, 5,849 middle peasants, and 3,672 poor peasants, for a total of 9,987 people. The mutual aid groups possess 1,321 head of livestock and have reclaimed more than 30,000 mu of land. In the fifth district of Guangzong, the number of mutual aid groups has increased from 42 to more than 180, and sideline businesses have increased from more than 20 to more than 80. The entire district has reclaimed more than 9,000 mu of land, leveled thirty *li* of anti-Japanese trenches, and added 120 mu of land. Many villages have produced model groups and model figures. Shi Decai, a labor hero from Shengfotang in Wei County, led the entire village in mutual aid wheat harvesting and organized large-scale labor exchange. His own "cultivate one and save two" production plan is being gradually completed. His family has a total of 56 mu of land and four people. It is estimated that this year's income, after deducting food and expenses, will provide enough surplus grain to last for three years. The main problem in the current production movement in the Southern Hebei region is that leadership should be strengthened to prevent some areas from falling into a state of drifting along. The Guan County Party Committee's inspection of the autumn harvest mutual aid proved that the main reason for the failure was the leadership's failure to regard production as the central task. The Wu Yi County inspection of production found that the main reason for the slackening of production was the coercive style of leadership, which subjectively stipulated the number of mutual aid groups to be developed and assigned them to districts, resulting in forced group formation. In Beifengzheng Village, Ji Ze County, thirty-two groups were organized in one day, and all of them fell apart overnight. The leadership only followed its subjective requirements, which the masses could not accept. The county had previously developed 139 mutual aid groups, but now only four or five remain, and the rest have collapsed.

　　冀南农民解除封建枷锁生产情绪高涨互助发展
    【本报讯】冀南农民在解除封建剥削之后，纷纷组织起来，发家致富，生产情绪空前高涨。据冀南分社报导，邱县春这以来，互助组已发展一千二百八十组，其中包括富农三百三十七人，中农五千八百四十九人，贫农三千六百七十二人，共九千九百八十七人，参加互助牲口达一千三百二十一头，已开荒地三万余亩。广宗五区互助组由四十二个增至一百八十多个，副业由二十多处，增至八十多处，全区开荒地九千余亩，平抗日沟三十里，增地一百二十亩。不少村庄出现了模范组与模范人物，威县圣佛堂劳动英雄石德才领导了全村互助收麦，组织了全村大变工，他本人的耕一余二生产计划正逐步完成，他家共有地五十六亩，四口人，预计今年收入除去吃用花费，节余粮食，还够吃三年。冀南区生产运动，当前主要问题是应加强领导，防止某些地区陷入自流状态。冠县县委检查秋收互助，证明领导上没有把生产当作中心任务是失败的主要原因。武邑检查生产发现生产松懈的主要原因是领导上的强制作风，主观的规定了互助组发展数字，分配到区，形成了强迫编组现象，鸡泽北风正村一天组织了三十二组，一夜全散了；领导上只按主观要求，使群众接受不了，全县互助组以前曾发展到一百三十九个，现在只剩下四五个互助组，其余都垮了。
