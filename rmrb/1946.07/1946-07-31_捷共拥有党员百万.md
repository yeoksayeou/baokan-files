　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th: A London dispatch: Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, recently published a book reporting on the situation in Czechoslovakia after attending the Czech Communist Party Congress. It is stated that in Slovakia, the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party have merged into a united party, with members accounting for twenty-five out of the total population of 2.59 million. In the Czech Republic, the Social Democratic Party remains independent, while the Communist Party members account for one million out of the national population of 8.1 million – that is, one-eighth of the entire population (including children). In some towns, Communists account for 25 percent of the local population. The Czech Communist Party (including the Slovak Communist Party) is the second largest communist party in the new democratic European countries, the largest being the Italian Communist Party – with approximately 1.8 million members in February this year. The third largest is the French Communist Party – with 1.2 million members in May this year.
