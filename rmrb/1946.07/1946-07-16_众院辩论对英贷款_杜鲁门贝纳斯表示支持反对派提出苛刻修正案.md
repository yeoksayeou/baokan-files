Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: According to Washington, the debate on the loan to Britain began in the US House of Representatives on the 8th. Truman and Byrnes submitted messages to the House, reiterating their support for the bill. Truman wrote to the House Banking and Currency Committee, stating that the loan is "an integral part of America's international economic policy." Without this loan, it would be difficult to carry out the United Nations' plans for international economic cooperation.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Washington: The loan to Britain is still being debated in the US House of Representatives, and the opposition has proposed several important and harsh amendments. Representative Cole, a key Republican member of the Naval Affairs Committee from New York, proposed that the United States lease the islands of Trinidad (north of Venezuela), British Guiana (at the northern tip of South America), the Bahamas (northeast of Cuba), Bermuda (east of the United States), and Newfoundland completely to the United States for a term of ninety-nine years. Representative Dickson, a Republican from Illinois, proposed that Britain should be forced to provide equivalent collateral in order to obtain the loan from the United States. He threatened that if this amendment was rejected, he would propose that the loan bill itself be returned to the Banking and Currency Committee "for a complete study of the collateral issue." However, congressional experts believe that the biggest obstacle to approving the loan is the Palestine issue. Representative Miller, a Democrat from New York, announced that he would propose an amendment that no loan would be granted to Britain until it guarantees to allow 100,000 Jews to enter Palestine immediately. Due to the intensity of the debate, the House of Representatives has decided to extend the debate on the loan bill by one day, until the 13th for a vote. Outside of Congress, Eugene Meyer, Chairman of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, gave a speech on the 9th, advocating for the passage of the loan to Britain.

　　众院辩论对英贷款
    杜鲁门贝纳斯表示支持反对派提出苛刻修正案
    【新华社延安十二日电】据华府讯：对英贷款辩论，已于八日在美众院开始举行，杜鲁门与贝纳斯特以咨文提交众院，重申对此一议案表示支持之意。杜鲁门致函众院银行货币委员会，称此次贷款为“美国国际经济政策完整之一部分”，若无此一贷款，不易进行联合国国际经济合作之计划。
    【新华社延安十三日电】华府讯：对英贷款仍在美众院辩论中，反对派已提出几个重要而苛刻的修正案。纽约州共和党重要议员、海军委员会委员柯尔提议，将目前美国占据的特主尼达岛（在委内瑞拉之北）、英属圭亚那（在南美洲北端）、巴哈马群岛（在古巴之东北）、百尔慕他群岛（在美国之东）与纽芬兰完全租与美国，为期九十九年。伊里诺斯州共和党议员德克逊提议，英国要获得美国的贷款，应该被迫提出相等的抵押品。他威胁说，如果这一修正案被拒绝时，他将提议贷款案本身退回银行货币委员会，“以便关于抵押问题作完全的研究”。然而国会专家认为对批准贷款之最大的阻碍，是巴勒斯坦问题。纽约州民主党议员密勒曾宣布，他将提出项修正案，在英保证准许十万犹太人即刻进入巴勒斯坦之前，不予英国贷款。由于辩论之激烈，众院对贷款案的辩论已决定延长一天，至十三日付表决。在国会之外，国际建设开发银行的董事长梅耶，于九日发表演说，主张通过对英贷款。
