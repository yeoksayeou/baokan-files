　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Shanghai News: It has recently been discovered that the Kuomintang government authorities have actually removed 400 names from the list of "dangerous and reactionary Nazi elements" that the Allied countries previously requested to be repatriated. This list includes 1,500 people, including secret agents of the "Ehrlich Bureau" who became Japanese lackeys after the German surrender, as well as Nazi secret agents and German nationals inclined towards Nazism. The Kuomintang fascists, because some of those on the list had relationships with them, such as Stanis, who once served as Chiang Kai-shek's bodyguard, and many who had held important advisory positions in the Kuomintang government, decided to retain a portion of them. Government officials even extorted 20 to 100 gold bars or a certain amount of US dollars from each of those who were retained as "protection fees," and used a "revised" list as substitutes. The German nationals who were not removed and used as substitutes were originally scheduled to return to their country at the end of last month. Recently, the Luoping ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin and Qingdao, fully loaded with volunteers posing as returnees to Germany, while the Nazi elements remained at large. However, because this has aroused strong opposition from Chinese and foreign personages, they are now planning to send the imposters back to Qingdao and Tianjin.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Harbin News: A plan by the Northeast Chiang army to organize Japanese troops to attack the Democratic Allied Army was partially exposed in a report by Liu Liquan, executive committee member of the Kuomintang Harbin Municipal Party Department, to Shi Jian, chairman of the Kuomintang Jilin Provincial Party Department. According to the report, the Kuomintang reactionaries planned to first organize the remnants of Japanese bandits lurking in the eastern part of Songjiang Province, and then contact Japanese bandits in Jiamusi to the north and the Greater Khingan Mountains to the northwest. The report described this arrogant plan as follows: "If the work in the east is successful, three to five armies can be established, which will be a considerable supplement to the government." The report also revealed the Kuomintang reactionary plan: this mixed organization of Japanese soldiers and bandits will riot in various places in the name of the so-called "Northeast National Autonomous Village Clearing United Association" to indicate that it is non-partisan and independent. Shi Jian concurrently serves as the commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang's so-called advance army, and Liu Liquan concurrently serves as the commander of the Songjiang 13th Detachment of the so-called advance army. Liu's report was issued on April 29th.

　　国民党政府当局包庇纳粹分子
    【新华社延安十六日电】沪讯：近日发现国民党政府当局对过去盟国提出应遣归的“危险暨反动的纳粹分子”名单，竟剔除四百名。该名单包括德国投降后转充日本鹰犬之“爱尔哈特局”特务人员，及纳粹特务分子与倾向纳粹之德侨共一千五百名。国民党法西斯派以该名单中与自己有关系者，如曾任蒋介石保镖之史丹利斯及曾任国民党政府顾问要职者多人等，决定保留一部分。政府官员并向被保留者每人索取金条二十根至一百根或美金若干，以为“保护费”，且以“订正后”之名单为替身。未被剔除及作替身之德侨，原定上月底返国，最近罗平号轮船自天津及青岛抵沪，满船均载志愿返德之冒充者，纳粹分子则仍逍遥法外。但因已引起中外人士之强烈反对，又拟将冒充者送返青、津云。
    【新华社延安十四日电】哈尔滨讯：东北蒋军组织日军进攻民主联军计划，在国民党哈尔滨市党部执委刘立权向该党吉林省党部主委石坚报告中暴露一部分。根据该报告，国民党反动派计划先组织松江省东部潜伏日寇残余，然后与其以北佳木斯及其西北之大兴安岭等地的日匪联系。该报告叙述此种狂妄的计划称：“如果东部之工作成功时，可建立三个军至五个军兵力，对于政府有相当之补助”。该报告又透露国民党反动计划：此种日兵与土匪之混合组织，以所谓“东北国民自治清乡联合会”名义，在各地暴动，表示无党无派。按石坚兼任国民党所谓先遣军总司令，刘立权兼任所谓先遣军的松江十三支队司令，刘之报告系于四月二十九日发出。
