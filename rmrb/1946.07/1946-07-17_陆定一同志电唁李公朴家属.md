Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th. Comrade Lu Dingyi sent a telegram of condolence to the family of Mr. Li Gongpu. The original telegram is as follows: Mrs. Manjun and all the family members of Mr. Gongpu:

　　I was shocked and grieved to hear of Mr. Gongpu's assassination! Mr. Gongpu devoted himself to the cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy, and engaged in mass cultural and educational movements, making great contributions to the country and the people. The fascist reactionaries have so heartlessly murdered a leader of the masses! Mr. Gongpu's glorious sacrifice will arouse a surge of anger among the people of the whole country, and will give a powerful counterattack to those who insist on betraying the country, engaging in civil war, and pursuing dictatorship. In the friendship of a comrade-in-arms, I respectfully express my condolences and hope that you will strive to restrain your grief and carry on his will!

　　Lu Dingyi, July 14th
