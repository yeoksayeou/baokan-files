Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 9th. The elected provincial government chairmen and provincial assembly speakers of the nine northeastern provinces, representing 40 million people in the Northeast, jointly issued a circular telegram, appealing to the people of the whole country and all democratic parties to resolutely oppose the Kuomintang internal fascists colluding with American reactionaries to carry out civil war, and to act in unity to strive for national independence and national peace and democracy. The telegram stated: After the "September 18th" Incident, under the Kuomintang government's policy of non-resistance, our vast land in the Northeast fell into the hands of the enemy, and 40 million people were brutally ravaged by Japanese fascists for fourteen years. We never saw the government authorities send a single soldier or weapon here. Now, the sovereignty of the Northeast territory belongs to the people, and according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles of landlord democracy and autonomy, people-elected governments at all levels have been established. Unexpectedly, the Kuomintang reactionaries are using the pretext of recovering the Northeast territory and sovereignty to launch military attacks. What crime have the people of the Northeast committed to be plunged into this abyss of misery again?

Now that sovereignty is in the hands of the people themselves, may we ask what right does Chiang Kai-shek have to "recover territorial sovereignty" from the people? In order to achieve this shameless goal, the reactionaries have lost all national integrity, inviting American imperialist accomplices to help them, allowing the American army, navy, and air force to station troops on Chinese territory, allowing American goods to be dumped and flow freely, and allowing foreign ships to sail on inland rivers. The people must swear to resist all such acts of betraying national sovereignty! We, the people of the Northeast, resolutely oppose dictatorial acts that endanger the country and resolutely oppose American imperialist elements' armed interference in China's internal affairs. Therefore, we, on behalf of the people of the Northeast, urgently appeal that all domestic disputes must be resolved through political means in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. We demand that the US military stationed in China earnestly abide by the Moscow Resolution, immediately withdraw from China, and stop all military aid to the reactionaries. Only in this way can the construction of an independent, peaceful, and democratic new China be hoped for. The signatories include Zhang Xueshi, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government; Zhu Qiwen, Vice Chairman; Bai Xiqing and Wang Shuzhang, Resident Members of the Provisional Assembly; Li Youwen, Chairman of the Liaobei Provincial Government; Wang Huanwen, Vice Chairman and Acting Speaker of the Provisional Assembly; Li Diping, Deputy Speaker; Gao Chongmin, Chairman of the Andong Provincial Government; Liu Lanbo and Lü Qien, Vice Chairmen; Chen Xianzhou, Speaker of the Provisional Assembly; Zhou Baozhong, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government; Yu Danfeng, Deputy Speaker of the Provisional Assembly; Li Yanlu, Chairman of the Songjiang Provincial Government; Lin Jingman, Vice Chairman; Chen Dafan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government; Yang Qijie, Vice Chairman; Yu Tianfang, Speaker of the Provisional Assembly; Fan ×ren, Deputy Speaker; Yu Yifu, Chairman of the Nenjiang Provincial Government; Che Xiangchen, Vice Chairman; Zhang Jingzhi, Chairman of the Xing'an Province (the following digits are missing).

　　东北九省民选省主席议长
　  代表四千万人民呼吁望国人坚决反对蒋美勾结进行内战一致行动争取民族独立与和平民主
    【新华社哈尔滨九日电】东北九省民选省政府主席及省参议会议长，顷代表东北四千人民联名通电，吁请全国人民各民主党派坚决反对国民党内法西斯主义者勾结美国反动分子进行内战，一致以行动争取民族独立与全国的和平民主。该电称：“九一八”后，在蒋介石政府不抵抗政策下，我东北广大土地沦于敌手，四千万人民残遭日本法西斯疯狂蹂躏十四年之久，受尽苦难，从未见政府当局来此一兵一卒。目前东北领土主权已归人民所有，并根据孙中山先生地主民主自治原则，建立各级民选政府，不料国民党反动派竟以收复东北领土主权为借口，兴师进攻。我东北人民何辜，又重陷于此水深火热之境耶？
    现在既然主权已握在人民自己手里，试问蒋介石有何权利向人民“收复领土主权”？反动派为达到此无耻目的，竟丧尽民族气节，请来美帝国主义帮凶，任美陆海空军驻扎中国领土，任美货倾销畅流，任外国轮船航行内河。凡此种种出卖国家主权的行为，人民一定要誓死反对！我东北人民坚决反对独裁的祸国行为，坚决反对美帝国主义分子武装干涉中国内政。故我等特代表东北人民紧急呼吁，一切国内纠纷，均须根据政协决议，以政治方法解决。我们要求驻华美军切实遵守莫斯科决议，立即撤离中国，并停止给反动派一切军事援助。如此，则独立和平民主新中国之建设，始有望也。署名者有辽宁省政府主席张学诗、副主席朱其文，临参会驻会议员白希清、王树章，辽北省政府主席栗又文、副主席代临参会议长王焕文、副议长李砥平，安东省政府主席高崇民、副主席刘澜波、吕其恩、临参会议长陈先舟，吉林省政府主席周保中、临参会副议长郁丹枫，松江省政府主席李延禄、副主席林精墁，黑龙江省政府主席陈大凡、副主席杨萋杰、临参会议长于天放、副议长范×人，嫩江省政府主席于毅夫、副主席车向忱，兴安省主席张静之（下缺数字）。
