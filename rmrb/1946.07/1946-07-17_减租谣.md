Rent Reduction Rhyme
    Feet on other people's land, head under other people's sky,
    Tens of thousands of tenant farmers, suffering generation after generation,
    Plowing, sowing, and harvesting, busy all year round,
    As soon as the grain enters the granary, carts and horses arrive at the door,
    The landlord raises the large dipper, collecting rent with a glare.
    × × ×
    Winnowing basket winnows, fan cart fans,
    After paying the rent, the grain is gone,
    Working hard in mud and water all year,
    Not even a single grain of millet to see.
    × × ×
    The landlord has a leisurely life,
    Gambling away money and then smoking opium,
    Eating and drinking, wearing silk and satin,
    Where does the food and clothing come from?
    All from the blood and sweat of the tenant farmers.
    × × ×
    Since the Communist Party came,
    The lives of the tenant farmers have improved,
    Those who till the land unite with one mind,
    The struggle for rent reduction is greatly expanded.
    Now, eating enough and dressing warmly,
    Organizing mutual aid for production,
    Thanks to the Communist Party,
    For leading the tenant farmers to stand up.

　　减租谣
    脚踏人家地，头顶人家天，
    佃户千千万，辈辈受熬煎，
    耕种又收割，四季忙不完，
    粮食刚进囤，车马到门前，
    地主提大斗，收租把眼翻。
    ×  ×  ×
    簸箕簸，扇车扇，
    交了租，粮食完，
    泥里水里干一年，
    黄米颗颗不见面。
    ×  ×  ×
    庄上好清闲，
    赌罢钱来抽大烟，
    吃酒内，穿绸缎，
    吃穿那儿来，
    都是佃户的血和汗。
    ×  ×  ×
    自从来了共产党，
    佃户生活得改善，
    种地的团结一股劲，
    减租斗争大开展。
    到如今，吃的饱，穿的暖，
    组织互助搞生产，
    感谢共产党，
    领导佃户把身翻。
