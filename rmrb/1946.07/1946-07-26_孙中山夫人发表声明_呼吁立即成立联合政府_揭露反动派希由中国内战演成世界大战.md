　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 23rd: According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on July 22nd: Madame Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, in her first political action in more than two years, warned that the Chinese civil war, though undeclared, has already begun, and urged the immediate establishment of a coalition government. She pointed out that the reactionaries hope to expand this conflict into a world war through the Chinese civil war, involving both the United States and the Soviet Union. She issued a statement saying: China is suffering from the disaster of civil war; the reactionaries hope to drag the United States and the Soviet Union into this civil war, thereby involving the whole world. This civil war, although not declared, has already begun. She said: A coalition government must be established immediately, because civil war cannot solve the problem. She continued: Why do the reactionaries want to launch a civil war that they know they cannot win? Because they hope that the Chinese civil war will incite a war between the United States and the Soviet Union, thereby ultimately eliminating the Chinese Communist Party. It must be clearly told to our allies, the old friends of the Chinese people—the American people—that this is a path to disaster; it must be told to them that the American reactionaries are colluding with the Chinese reactionaries, mutually fueling each other; it must be told to them that the presence of American troops on Chinese soil is not to consolidate peace and order among the Chinese people; the United States must be warned that loans should only be given to a truly representative government after reorganization; they must be told that if the Americans clearly declare that they will not supply arms or military assistance, the civil war will not expand. I now appeal to American friends that military supplies and assistance should be given to the government that will belong to the Chinese people; I appeal to all major parties and all other parties in China to immediately establish such a coalition government.

　　孙中山夫人发表声明
    呼吁立即成立联合政府
    揭露反动派希由中国内战演成世界大战
    【新华社延安二十三日电】据合众社上海二十二日电：孙中山夫人宋庆龄，在她两年多以来的第一次政治行动中，警告中国内战虽未宣战，但早已开始。并敦促立即成立联合政府。她指明反动派希望经由中国内战，扩展此种冲突成为世界大战，将美国与苏联亦牵涉其中。她发表声明称：中国正受到内战的灾难；反动派希望将美国与苏联拉入这种内战中，从而牵涉至全世界。这种内战，虽然没有宣布，但早已开始。她说：联合政府必须立即建立，因为内战不能解决问题。继称：为什么反动派要发动明知不能战胜的内战呢？因为他们希望中国的内战将激起美苏战争，从而最后消灭中国共产党。必须明白的告诉我们的盟国、中国人民的老友——美国人民，这乃是引至灾难的道路；必须告诉他们，美国的反动派正与中国反动派狼狈为奸，相互助长；必须告诉他们，美国军队的驻在中国土地上，并不是在中国人民间巩固和平与秩序；必须警告美国，贷款只应该贷予改组以后的真正代议性的政府；必须告诉他们，如果美国人明白的宣布，将不供给军火或军事援助，内战将不会扩大。我现在向美国的朋友们呼吁，军事供应与援助，应给予将属于中国人民的政府；我向中国各大党及所有其他党派呼吁，立即成立那样的联合政府。
