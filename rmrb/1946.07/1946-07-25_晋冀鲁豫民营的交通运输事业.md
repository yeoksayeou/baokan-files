　　Many enthusiastic capitalists are engaged in the transportation business in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region. The scale of their businesses varies, and their management methods differ. However, after gradually overcoming various difficulties and proving that profits can be made, they are all preparing for further expansion.
　　The Handan Yutong Transport Co., Ltd., initiated by Mr. Wu Boheng, Mr. Fan Yueting, and others, is now actively preparing while also starting operations. The original Transportation Company of the Border Region Government has been transferred to them. They have also collected and purchased from other sources, and now have a total of 27 vehicles, 20 of which can be used after repair. Among them, 13 have been converted to burn wood, and the remaining 7 still use alcohol and gasoline. There are also 54 rubber-tired and iron-wheeled carts, traveling between Handan, Wu'an, Xingtai, and Gaoyi. The total number of staff and workers is 170. In Xingtai, Mr. Liu Lesan and others operate the Yuhua Transport Company, with 7 vehicles and 15 rubber-tired carts, traveling between Xingtai and Gaoyi, carrying passengers and goods, with 80 employees. There is also the Lihua Motor Company, with 3 vehicles, mainly carrying passengers between Handan and Xingtai. In Changzhi, the Jin Feng Transport Co., Ltd., initiated by Mr. Zhou Dexin and others, is actively preparing, and currently has 10 vehicles and 29 rubber-tired and iron-wheeled carts, traveling between Changzhi, Xiangyuan, and Jincheng, carrying passengers and goods. The Hengli Motor Company, originally in Handan with 8 vehicles, has recently moved to Weixian in southern Hebei in order to develop its business, traveling between Weixian, Nangong, Linqing, and Daming to carry passengers. In Jining, Shandong-Hebei-Henan, Mr. Niu Lianwen and others operate the Xinghua Motor Company, which owns nearly 100 vehicles. Currently, 50 are repaired and usable, with branches and stations in Heze and Tai'an, and a total of 209 employees. It is reported that those enthusiastic about the transportation business in the Taiyue area are also initiating the organization of a motor company, currently raising funds and preparing to purchase, collect, and repair vehicles from various places, planning to operate on the Jincheng, Yicheng, and Quwo lines. The initial number of vehicles may be 10 to 15.
　　The Liberated Areas are still blockaded, making it impossible to purchase vehicles from outside, and there is a shortage of technicians and drivers. However, repair work is being carried out with great effort. They piece together parts to assemble usable vehicles. If there is no gasoline, they switch to burning wood or firewood. And what is enough to be proud of is that almost all vehicles are used for circulating goods and developing commerce. Yuhua Company has two vehicles fully loaded with more than 70 passengers each day heading to Gaoyi, 90 percent of whom are merchants. Sometimes three vehicles are dispatched, and on the busiest day, all seven vehicles are used, including those carrying goods. The employees watch the vehicles speeding along the smooth highway one after another, and smile excitedly. Their transportation fee profits in May and June were over 3 million yuan, and other companies also have significant profits. Yutong, Yuhua, Jin Feng and other companies have set up sales departments to cooperate with transportation, and when there are fewer passengers and goods, they purchase and transport goods themselves. There is no fixed route yet, but if someone wants to hire a private car, they also carry goods themselves on the return trip, which can reduce the price of the car and avoid losses for the company. Each transport company is focusing its expansion on large vehicles. Yutong plans to increase to 200 vehicles by the end of the year, while Yuhua and Jin Feng plan to increase to 100 vehicles.
　　Yutong and Yuhua are piloting a wage system that benefits both labor and capital. The method is to divide wages into two parts: one is a fixed wage, which can support one to one and a half people in addition to the individual's food, clothing, and expenses. Top drivers receive 240 kilograms of rice per month, with a reduction for those with poor skills. Each person receives two sets of work clothes and one bar of soap per month. The other part is profit-sharing, based on the vehicle. After deducting fuel and other consumption and repair costs, 20 percent of the vehicle's total monthly income is proportionally distributed to the driver, assistant, and apprentice. This method greatly enhances the workers' enthusiasm for learning technology, and also makes them more careful in maintaining vehicles and saving fuel. Originally, it always took a day for a car to travel from Xingtai to Handan, but now it only takes two hours. Yang Chunfeng, a worker at Yutong, traveled from Handan to Gaoyi and back to Handan in one day, a distance of 520 li, before dark, making the wood-burning car exceed the speed of a gasoline car. The faster the car goes, the more fuel is saved, the more opportunities there are to run, and the more income there is, and the more the workers share. Zhao Guotai and Zhao Yongquan, drivers of Yuhua Company, received 60,000 yuan in June, and most others received 25,000 to 30,000 yuan. The method for cart drivers is the same, only the fixed wage is lower.
　　Recently, according to the "Provisional Second Draft of Highway Management" of the Border Region Government, Yutong Company signed a one-year contract with the Border Region Highway Administration, from July of this year to July of next year, leasing the Shi (Jiazhuang) An (Yang) section of the highway for business, and managing the section of the highway on behalf of the Highway Bureau. That is, all the tax revenue of the road is borne by Yutong Company, but other vehicles and rubber-tired carts traveling on the road must pay a donation to the company to obtain a license. The Border Region Government also notified the district and township governments along the road to assist Yutong Company in investigating and prohibiting iron-wheeled carts from traveling on the highway. To thank the government, the company decided that all violations of road regulations will be resolved by the local government, and plans to allocate half of the fines to the informant and half to the government for road repairs or other public welfare purposes. As a result, the company's business is more convenient, and highway management is more effective.
　　It can be predicted that, with the support of the democratic government and under the correct policy of benefiting both labor and capital, the private transportation business in the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region will have a bright future.

　　晋冀鲁豫民营的交通运输事业
    吴象
    不少热心的资本家，在晋冀鲁豫区从事交通运输事业。他们事业规模的大小不一，经营的方法不一。但逐渐克服各种困难，事实证明可以获利之后，都在准备进一步的扩充。
    武伯珩、范樾庭先生等发起成立的邯郸裕通转运股份有限公司，现在一面继续积极筹备，一面已开始营业，原属边府之交通运输总公司，已转让给他们。他们又从其他方面搜集购买，现共有汽车二十七辆，经修理后能继续使用的廿辆，其中十三辆改装成烧木炭的，其余七辆仍用酒精汽油。往来于邯郸、武安、邢台、高邑之间，胶皮及铁轮大车五十四辆。全部职员工人共一百七十人。在邢台，有刘乐三先生等经营之裕华转运公司，有汽车七辆，胶皮大车十五辆，往来邢台、高邑之间，载客运货，职工八十人。另有利华汽车公司，有汽车三辆，主要是载客，往来于邯郸、邢台之间。在长治，有周德馨先生等发起的晋丰转运股份有限公司，正在积极筹备，刻已有汽车十辆，胶皮及铁轮大车二十九辆，在长治、襄垣、晋城之间往来载客运货。原在邯郸之恒利汽车公司，有汽车八辆，近为发展营业，已迁往冀南威县，在威县、南宫、临清、大名间往来载客。冀鲁豫之济宁，有牛连文先生等经营之兴华汽车公司，拥有汽车近百辆，现在已修理得能用的即有五十辆，在荷泽、泰安设有分公司及分站，职工共二百零九人。闻太岳区热心运输事业人士，亦正在发起组织汽车公司，刻正在募股筹备，从各处购买搜集修理汽车，拟在晋城、翼城、曲沃等线行驶。其最初行驶车辆可能为十部至十五部。
    解放区至今仍然被封锁，无法从外间购买车辆，技师司机缺乏。但修理工作正在努力进行，他们东拚西凑地把零件装成可用的汽车，没有汽油则改烧木炭或劈柴。而且足以自豪的是几乎所有的车辆，都用于流通货物，发展商业。裕华公司每日有两辆汽车满满地载着七十多个乘客驶往高邑，其中百分之九十是商人，多的时候开三辆，最多的一天，连运货把七辆车都开走了，职工们看着汽车一辆接一辆在平坦的公路上奔驰而去，都兴奋的笑了。他们五六两个月运输费获利，都在三百万元以上，其他公司也都有很大的利。裕通、裕华、晋丰等公司都设有营业部门以配合运输，在客货较少的时候，自己购货转运。现在尚无固定路线，但有人要雇专车的，返回时亦自己带货，这样可使车价减低，公司又不致吃亏。各个转运公司都把扩充的重点放到大车上，裕通到年底准备增到二百辆，裕华、晋丰则准备增到一百辆。
    裕通与裕华两家试行了一种劳资两利的工资制度。办法是分工资为两部分：一是固定工资，除本人吃穿用之外能养活一口至一口半人。头等司机每月二百四十斤米，技术差的酌减，每人每年发两套工作服，每月一条肥皂。另一部分是分红，以车为单位，除燃料等消耗及修理费外，以该车全月收入的百分之二十按比例归司机助手与学徒。这种办法大大提高了工人学习技术的热忱，而且使他们更加爱护车辆，节省燃料。原来邢台到邯郸的汽车总是一天才能到，现在只要两个多钟头就到了。裕通的工人杨春风一天从邯郸到高邑，又返回邯郸，走五百二十里天不黑，使木炭车超过了汽油车的速度。车愈走得快，就愈省燃料，出车机会也愈多，收入也愈多，工人分红也愈多。裕华公司司机赵国泰、赵永泉六月份分到六万，一般的也都分到二万五至三万。赶大车工人办法相同，只是固定工资较少罢了。
    最近，裕通公司根据边府公路管理暂行第二草案，与边区公路管理局订立了一年合同，自今年七月至明年七月，租赁石（门）安（阳）段公路营业，并代公路局管理该段公路。即该路全部税收由裕通公司负担，但其他行驶该路的汽车胶皮大车，则向公司出捐领取牌照。边府并通知沿路区乡政府，协助裕通公司查禁铁轮大车在公路上行驶。公司为答谢政府，决定凡查获违犯路规情事，均在当地政府解决，拟将罚款半归告发者，半归政府作修路或其他公益之用。至此，公司营业更感方便，公路管理也更切实有效了。
    可以预断，在民主政府赞助之下，在劳资两利的正确方针之下，晋冀鲁豫民营的交通运输事业，将有远大的发展前途。
