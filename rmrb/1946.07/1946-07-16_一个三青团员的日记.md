Found in Ni Xin Village, Anyang, a diary of a Sanqing Tuan member, containing several short poems, which can very well serve as a self-portrait of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Excerpts are provided below for the readers:

(I)
	"Three Principles" become "scattered people," "Consultation" becomes "bloody commerce,"
	Why do beans and stalks slaughter each other? Flesh and blood are wounded again.

(II)
	Bragging and flattery, official promotion and wealth,
	Burying oneself in hard work, demotion and investigation.

(III)
	Holding incense in the left hand, holding a gun in the right,
	Burning incense when seeing bad people, shooting good people.

(IV)
	Axe tucked in the waist, basket on the back,
	Cheat if you can, deceive if you can.

　　一个三青团员的日记
    王兴梭
    在安阳倪辛庄拾得一个三青团员的日记，其中有小诗数首，很可以作为国民党反动派的自画像，兹特摘录以飨读者：
  （一）
    “三民”成“散民”，“协商”成“血商”，
    箕豆何相残，骨肉复被创。
  （二）
    吹牛拍马，官升财发，
    埋头苦干，撤职查办。
  （三）
    左手持香，右手持枪，
    见坏人烧香，见好人打枪。
  （四）
    腰里掖着斧，背上背着筐，
    得骗就骗，得诳就诳。
