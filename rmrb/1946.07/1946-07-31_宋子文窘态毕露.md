Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th. According to the Southwest Daily, during a press conference held by the Central Propaganda Department at the Executive Yuan on June 19th, Song Ziwen unusually met with Chinese reporters publicly. The reporters were initially silent, but then asked questions continuously. When reporters asked, "To what extent has inflation risen?" Song replied: "To what extent have prices risen, to that extent has inflation risen." A reporter asked, "What measures does the government have to address the financial and economic crisis?" Song replied: "What measures do you have?" (Frankly, without peace, there are no measures). In response to a reporter's question about the Central Bank of Shanghai selling gold at high prices and buying it back at low prices, Song did not deny it, and said: "If you only sell and don't buy back stock, wouldn't it all be sold off?" Regarding the appointment of the Englishman Bailey as the Commissioner of Customs, he emphasized that Bailey had always been very helpful to China. Regarding the grain loan scandal, when asked by a reporter whether the case was related to Xu Kan and Kong Lingkan, he quoted an English saying: "Anything that goes to court, there is no need to ask about it."

　　宋子文窘态毕露
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据西南日报揭载：中宣部六月十九日在行政院举行记者招待会，宋子文居然破例地与中国记者公开见面。记者初为沉默，继而发问不断，记者询以“通货膨胀到什么程度”时，宋称：“物价涨到什么程度，通货膨胀到什么程度”。记者问：“政府对财政经济危机有什么办法”？宋称：“你有什么办法”？（老实说，不和平，什么办法都没有）。在答复记者问上海中央银行高价抛出黄金，低价时又收进一事时，宋并不否认，并说：“如果卖出不买进存货，岂不要卖完了”对江海关税务司用英人白礼查一事，他强调说：白礼查一向对中国很帮忙。对粮贷舞币案，在答复记者问此案与徐堪及孔令侃有关时，他引用了一句英文说：“凡一件事到了法院者，就不必问了”。
