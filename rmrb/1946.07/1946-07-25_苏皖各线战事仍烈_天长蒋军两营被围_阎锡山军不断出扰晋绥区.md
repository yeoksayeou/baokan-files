Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 22nd. The Chiang Kai-shek troops on the southern, northern and western fronts besieging the Jiangsu-Anhui Liberated Areas continue their advances. The 45th Division of the Fifth Army, based in Liuhe and attempting to invade Tianchang, advanced to the Dongwangmiao and Lijiawa line, more than 30 li southwest of Tianchang, on the 19th. The New Fourth Army is fighting back resolutely. Two battalions of Chiang's troops have been surrounded, and 300 of them have already been wiped out. As of late night on the 20th, the fierce battle was still going on. The 96th Division of the same army, dispatched from Lai'an and attempting to invade Xuyi, has advanced to the Xinglongji line, 45 li northeast of Lai'an, and the Pengxingji line, 20 li northwest of Lai'an. A regiment of the 172nd Division of the Seventh Army from the Mingguang area has repeatedly occupied Shiba, east of Mingguang. Two regiments of the 138th Division of the 48th Army, stationed along the Jinpu Railway south of Mingguang, are also preparing to attack. Since the 13th, 25 larger towns and villages in the east of Jinpu Railway in the Huainan Liberated Area have been occupied. More than 200 men of the Liu Dashui bandit troops under the command of Chiang’s troops in Xinpu and Haizhou occupied Shangfang Street, west of Xinba, on the 14th, and reoccupied Mao Ben and Xiangshao on the 15th. The New Fourth Army counterattacked them on the morning of the 19th. After two hours of fierce fighting, Shangfang Street was recovered. More than 60 enemy troops, including the deputy captain, were killed, and more than 100 men and guns were captured.
    Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 22nd. Recently, the Yan puppet troops have been harassing the Jin-Sui Liberated Area from the central, northern, and southern fronts with increasing frequency in an attempt to "nibble away" villages and towns and plunder materials. (1) The Yan army's 45th Division and the Aixiang Regiment, which attacked the Fen (Xi) Xi (County) Liberated Area in southwestern Shanxi, have occupied the Houwangdie, Majiazai, Maojiashangzhuang, Laofengshan, Wulongdian, Zhongcun, and Beicun areas northwest of Fenxi City. Recently, they joined forces with more than 800 puppet troops from Sangyuan (northwest of Fenxi City) to invade Xiangzhen (west of Fenxi City) again and occupy it. (2) In the Datong area, the Chu Xichun's troops have harassed villages near Kouquan Town, Zhuhe, and Xinzhou Yaozi in the western part of Datong as many as 23 times in the past week, carrying out wanton burning, killing, and looting. The 38th Division of Huai Ren, led by Han Shaozhou (originally reorganized from the puppet "Provincial Defense" Fifth Army), advanced in two routes on the 15th to attack Modaohe, Songjiazhuang, south of Huai Ren. The Yanbei Eighth Route Army immediately counterattacked and the puppet troops fled back to Huai Ren. (3) The Yan army in central Shanxi has continued to nibble away at the large areas of plains around Fenyang, Wenshui, and Jiaocheng after invading and occupying them. A unit of the 71st Division of the Wenshui Yan army, equipped with Japanese troops and heavy fire power, has recently harassed more than 20 villages and towns, including Shiyong Town and Yongle Village south of Wenshui, in order to loot grain, causing the masses to lose more than 100,000 dan of grain. 712 people were captured and assassinated.
    Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 22nd. To cooperate with the large-scale offensive of Chiang's ground troops, Kuomintang aircraft have frequently dispatched sorties in recent days to bomb and strafe peaceful towns in the Liberated Areas. From June 18th to July 15th, Chiang's aircraft from Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou and other places bombed and strafed cities and railway stations in the Shandong Liberated Area more than 100 times. Linyi, the central area of the Liberated Area, as well as Taian, Zouxian, Dezhou and other places, were also bombed. Chiang's aircraft flew over the above-mentioned areas and dropped more than 40 bombs, causing more than 300 casualties among the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Area.
