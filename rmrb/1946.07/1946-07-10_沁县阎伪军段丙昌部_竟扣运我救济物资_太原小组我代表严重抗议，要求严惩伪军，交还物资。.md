【Report from Our Newspaper in Changzhi, 3rd】 Duan Bingchang’s puppet troops of Yan in Qin County detained relief supplies from UNRRA intended for our Taihang Liberated Area. My representative from the Taiyuan Executive Headquarters recently lodged a strong protest with the Guomindang representatives in Taiyuan and the Taiyuan Relief Sub-Office. These supplies (medicines, milk, clothing), totaling 400,000 catties, were intended for the 18 counties of the Second Administrative Region of Taihang and were escorted by Mr. An Dingyuan, a UNRRA Taiyuan Sub-Office supervisor. They arrived in Qin County on the 13th of last month but were detained by Duan Bingchang’s puppet troops of Yan. Despite our repeated negotiations, the Guomindang representative of the Executive Headquarters excused himself saying they had no vehicles and could not transport the supplies. On the 15th, Mr. An, together with our liaison officer Zhang Hanjun and the Guomindang liaison officer Li Qing, arrived at Duancun in the Wuxiang Liberated Area. They signed a temporary agreement with Fan Yusheng, the commissioner of our Taihang Second Administrative Office, stipulating that villages near Qin County would organize vehicles to transport 50,000 catties of relief supplies to Liangzhuang in Wuxiang and 350,000 catties to Xindian in Qin County. It was also decided that Communist, American, and Guomindang representatives would set up a group in the above two locations to resolve all transportation difficulties, with implementation to begin on the 17th. Unexpectedly, the next day (the 18th), the Yan puppet troops immediately closed the city gates, cutting off transportation. That night, Guomindang liaison officer Li Qing even led more than 1,200 Yan puppet troops from the city in a surprise attack on Songcun in our Qin County Liberated Area, killing and wounding more than 20 militiamen, capturing more than 40 people, and looting a large amount of property. Regarding this breach of contract by the Guomindang, my representative from the Taiyuan Executive Headquarters has lodged a strong protest with the Guomindang, demanding severe punishment for the puppet troops in the city and the return of all detained relief supplies to the people of the Liberated Area.
