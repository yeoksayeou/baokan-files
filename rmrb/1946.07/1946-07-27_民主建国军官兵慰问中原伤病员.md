　　Democratic Nation-Building Army Officers and Soldiers
    Console Wounded and Sick Soldiers from the Central Plains
    [Handan News] All officers and soldiers of the Democratic Nation-Building Army have been greatly angered by the reactionary crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in seizing the Central Plains Liberated Area and pursuing our breakthrough troops. They have been actively raising relief supplies to visit the wounded and sick soldiers, the sons and daughters of the Central Plains who had endured hardships before being "encircled and annihilated" and transferred to this area. The students of the Second Class of the Second Team of the Democratic Nation-Building College wrote in their sincere consolation letter: "Japan's unconditional surrender was earned by your eight years of persistence in sleeping in the open, traveling day and night, shedding blood and sweat. The dictator Chiang Kai-shek is madly trying to seize this victory, and we cannot tolerate it." The students of the Second Class of the Third Team wrote: "You liberated the people from the hands of the enemy, turning the enemy-occupied areas into a paradise-like liberated area, where the exploited and oppressed people were liberated and happily sang the song of great production... It is glorious for you to be killed or wounded by the reactionaries for the country and the people, and the reactionaries are bound to fail before the people." Many letters ended with: "Central Plains brothers, let us—the Democratic Nation-Building Army—join hands closely and continue to fight for independence, peace, and democracy!" They said with a hundredfold confidence: "We and the masses in the liberated areas wish the comrades who broke through from the Fifth Division continued success in their advance, and we sincerely hope that you, the comrades who were wounded in the anti-civil war, will recover your health soon!"

　　民主建国军官兵
    慰问中原伤病员
    【邯郸讯】民主建国军全体官兵，对国民党反动派侵夺中原解放区及穷追我突围部队的反动罪行，引起莫大义愤。并纷纷募集慰劳品前往慰劳，“围歼”前备尝艰辛转移至本区的中原子弟兵伤病员。民主建国学院二队二班的同学们，以真挚的感情，在其慰问信上写道：“日本的无条件投降，是你们八年坚持野地路宿、星夜奔波、流血流汗换来的，独夫蒋介石丧心病狂要来夺取这胜利果实，我们是不能容忍的。”三队二班的同学写道：“从敌人手里你们解放了人民，把敌占区变成了天堂般的解放区，被剥削被压迫的人们翻了身，幸福地唱着大生产之歌………你们为国为民而遭反动派的杀伤是光荣的，反动派一定要在人民面前失败。”在许多信的结尾都这样写着：“中原兄弟们和我们——民主建国军亲密地携起手来，继续为独立和平民主而斗争！”并以百倍的信心说：“我们和解放区群众祝五师突围同志们继续胜利前进，衷心地希望你们，反内战而负伤的同志们早复健康！”
