　　The "Civilized" Aggression and the "Great" "Betrayal"
　　Moye
　　"If this place is called 'Foreign Goods Market,' it wouldn't be far from the truth. With very few exceptions, almost everything sold on each stall is American goods. The categories of goods include: Western medicine, pens, glasses, pipes, perfume, matches, toothpaste, nylon toothbrushes, shoe polish, milk powder, syrup, flashlights, talcum powder, batteries, glass belts, glass combs, khaki shirts, rubber raincoats, cigarette cases, biscuits, canned food, cigarettes... and so on." This is a special feature by a Wenhui Daily reporter about the stallholders on Sichuan South Road in Shanghai. From this diverse scene of goods, it is not difficult to imagine how fiercely surplus American goods are flooding towards the Bund and even all of China!

　　Before the war, US trade with China accounted for only about 2.5% of its total exports, increasing to 15% around 1944, and now it has increased to 20%. According to Shanghai newspapers in mid-June, the ratio of China's imports to exports has reached ten to one, and American goods account for more than 70% of Shanghai's imports, with the total value of imported American goods exceeding 700 million US dollars. According to statistics in early July, China's imports are already twenty times more than its exports. These tangible figures are alarming enough, but the intangible smuggling of American goods is not included. Shanghai News: "In late June, the American ship USS Jefferson Mayall concealed smuggled goods on which taxes had not been paid. Some US Navy personnel have been openly and secretly smuggling goods, evading customs duties." According to Guangzhou News: "American goods (including drugs) are entering South China in large quantities under armed smuggling. Smugglers even openly transport opium paste, gasoline, etc. In April, an armed vessel smuggling gasoline (worth 30 million yuan) from Hong Kong to Humen even fired at customs officers with machine guns. Currently, the Guangdong Customs' monthly tax revenue is only 80 million yuan, with tax evasion amounting to a staggering 150 million yuan. Under such circumstances, South China has become a territory exclusively occupied by American goods." Reading these news reports cannot help but remind people of the rampant smuggling by Japanese ruffians and "Korean sticks" in North China around 1935.

　　In addition to warships, cannons, airplanes, tanks, jeeps, etc., imperialists have another weapon that kills without shedding blood: commodities. Today, Chiang Kai-shek's army is using American weapons to slaughter the Chinese people, while the massive dumping of American goods is simultaneously extracting high excess profits from the flesh and blood of the Chinese people.

　　The means by which American financial capital groups are colonizing China are not limited to commodity exports, but also include more poisonous capital exports. A command center for investment in China – the "China-America Council of Industry and Commerce" – has long been established in New York. Last year, it signed a massive plan with Chinese bureaucratic capital to invest in China, establish four mines in China, build highways and railways, and send experts to control the economic lifeline of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Recently, this plan has been actively underway, and American oil, shipbuilding, electrical, chemical, cement, and other factories are about to appear in China. As early as after Nelson (the US Economic Envoy to China and Chief Advisor to China's Wartime Production Board) came to China, he formulated a plan to develop China, which did not include heavy industry. The main point was to develop China's textile industry. In this development, American capital must control more than 60% of the shares of each company (see Nelson's paper: "China Can Help Us"). This plan to monopolize China's cotton textile industry is beginning to be realized with the help of the Chinese comprador bureaucratic group. In late April, two American textile giants were planning to "cooperate" with Chinese compradors to open textile factories in China.

　　The reason why American goods can be dumped in China in large quantities, swallowing up the Chinese market and putting the already fragile Chinese national industry in its current precarious situation, boils down to the Kuomintang authorities' reactionary domestic and foreign policies, and a series of treasonous acts that sell out national sovereignty and the interests of the people!

　　Due to the support of bureaucratic capital and the unlimited encouragement of foreign goods imports, the exchange rate has consistently remained at a low of around 2020 yuan, about 700 times higher than before the war, while Chinese prices have generally risen 3,500 times compared to before the war. Therefore, even if American goods imported into Shanghai are subject to a 20% tax, they can still generate two to ten times the profit, while the prices are still lower than Chinese goods.

　　The Kuomintang government's current tariff policy not only fails to protect tariffs, but also amounts to "inviting wolves into the house" for foreign goods imports. For example, the "Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade" are completely superficial when it comes to restricting foreign goods imports. Certain goods that can be produced domestically or are not necessary are still not included in the list of restricted imports. On the contrary, they are allowed to be imported in large quantities, and even receive tax-free treatment. For example, a question raised in a recent meeting of the Legislative Yuan mentioned that beer is taxed while soda is not, and flour is taxed while cosmetics such as lipstick and face powder are not. Therefore, many taxes that could be increased are deliberately ignored, allowing tax evasion.

　　The Central Bank's power to manage foreign exchange has also helped American monopoly capitalists to export goods to China, because bureaucratic comprador capital can freely obtain foreign exchange and import American goods. Chinese comprador bureaucratic capital and American imperialists have organized countless import and export companies, such as Kung Hsiang-hsi's son's Yangtze Construction Company, Soong Tzu-wen and Soong Tzu-liang's import and export trading companies, Jinshan Company, Lida Company, and the Sino-American Industrial Company jointly run by American Air Force officer Chennault and Chinese compradors, etc., all of which are major brokers for American goods imports.

　　The most important and most vicious tool to help American goods enter China unimpeded is the recent opening of the four inland ports of Jingjiang, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou, and the fact that the posts of Inspector General of Customs and Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs have been completely taken over by foreigners. These two treasonous "masterpieces" of the reactionary Kuomintang authorities – selling out navigation rights and ending customs autonomy – have aroused the concern, disapproval, condemnation, and appeals of the national navigation and industrial and commercial circles.

　　After the Opium War, the Treaty of Tianjin was signed in the eighth year of Xianfeng (1858), and as a defeated country, we opened Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou to foreign ships, and the inland river navigation rights, which are closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood, were lost from then on. As early as the International Communications Conference in Spain in 1920 and the Washington Conference in 1921, the Chinese delegation put forward a proposal, hoping to use the spirit of the new treaty to get rid of the shackles of the old treaty and regain navigation rights, but it ultimately failed due to the law of the jungle. It was not until the spring of 1943, when Britain and the United States abolished unequal treaties with China, that these long-lost navigation rights were recovered, and the people of the whole country rejoiced. How long has it been? Today, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the sovereignty that the Chinese people have fought for over the past century, especially during the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, has been sold out again by the reactionary Kuomintang authorities headed by Chiang Kai-shek! The sale of inland river navigation rights was approved by Chiang Kai-shek in advance, and then passed by Soong Tzu-wen at the Supreme National Defense Council. One point that is worth emphasizing here is that the sale of navigation rights is closely related to Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on expanding the civil war, and one of the main focuses is to facilitate the import of American military supplies into the interior.

　　China's shipping industry was already on the verge of collapse during the Anti-Japanese War. How can it withstand the fierce competition from foreign shipping companies now? I am afraid that within a year, China's private shipping industry will be completely bankrupt. Furthermore, with the loss of inland river navigation rights, foreign goods will inevitably flood into the interior more violently, thereby inevitably further depressing production in the interior. The profound impact on the national economy is truly unimaginable. (1)(2)

　　Soon after the opening of the four ports, the position of Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai was again taken over by a British person, Bai Charlie, upon the recommendation of the Inspector General of Customs, Li Du (an American), and with the appointment of the Ministry of Finance. Customs autonomy is one of the basic conditions that any independent country cannot lack; since the Great Revolution, customs autonomy has always been one of the topics of struggle for the Chinese people. There is no treaty stipulation that the position of Commissioner of Customs of various Chinese customs must be held by foreigners, and the position of Inspector General of Customs has a non-formal agreement that it should be held by a person from the country with the largest total import value, but this was only non-formally allowed by the Qing Dynasty's Prime Minister's Office and has not been seen in treaties; however, as it has been followed for a long time, the "unwritten law" that the Inspector General of Customs should be held by a British person has been formed. When the unequal treaties were abolished in 1943, the Sino-British New Treaty clearly stated that Britain had renounced its right to demand that a British person be appointed as Inspector General of Customs. Now, although the British person Meierhe, the Inspector General of Customs, has left, an American person, Li Du, has been invited again, and the power of customs of China's first trading port has been lightly handed over to foreigners. In addition, such as the Executive Yuan's promulgation of orders allowing foreign ships to travel to various coastal ports in China, loading and unloading cargo and passengers, and selling navigation rights between coastal ports; obeying MacArthur's decision to allow Japanese ships to fish in the coastal waters of China, these are all acts of opening the door to thieves and inviting wolves into the house. In particular, insisting on handing over the final decision-making power on China's internal affairs to the United States is even more crazy and shameless! Only that "leader" who is full of benevolence, justice, and morality can do such a great treasonous deed!

　　If selling navigation rights and ending customs autonomy is a "license" to let go and welcome foreign goods, then the "New Company Law" promulgated in April is a hotbed arranged for foreign capital. According to the provisions of the New Company Law: only those who are registered and organized under the special permission of a foreign government and operate in China are considered foreign companies, which actually regards the company established by foreigners in China as the parent company in China; if a foreign company establishes a branch in China, its parent company in its home country may not operate (refusing to accept the lowest restriction advocated by people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas – foreign companies must operate in their home country), then the foreign company can be completely tax-free in its home country, and its branch in China can also underreport capital to evade taxes (and only pay income tax on profits, and can not pay individual income tax of shareholders); there is no restriction on foreign investment in Chinese companies, and foreign capital can be increased to 96%; in a limited company, except that the chairman must be Chinese, there are no restrictions on the rest (such as managers, directors, etc.). Mr. Ma Yinchu called this New Company Law the "American Trade Law," which is a very incisive remark. There is no doubt that the import of American capital into China will increase day by day with the implementation of this New Company Law. According to Shanghai News: since the promulgation of the New Company Law, the number of American companies and stores that have opened branches in Shanghai has reached 115 so far according to investigations.

　　In the middle of last month, the American oil tycoon, now compensation commissioner, Paulley, led more than 30 people, including staff and secretaries, to inspect factories and mines in various parts of Northeast China, supposedly to "get a full view of the Northeast." His reply at the banquet hosted by the Mayor of Fushun was: "The first impression after getting off the car is that Fushun is like Pittsburgh in the United States... I will strive to complete the task." The "covetous" expression of this commissioner, who is full of oil, is not difficult to imagine. Several geologists among Paulley's entourage have discovered a very rich molybdenum mine, which can be called one of the largest mineral deposits in the world, in Yangjiaxiangzi, forty miles north of Huludao. Recently, the American Global Production Company has obtained the right to explore and exploit oil in many places, especially in the Gobi Desert area. The so-called "Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group" has recently been established, and all the American members have arrived in Shanghai. Its wool expert has gone to various parts of Northwest China with the director of the Kuomintang Northwest Wool Management Office to study China's wool industry. The head of the American delegation, Hutchison, said: the delegation "will pay special attention to studying the improvement and increase in production of China's four agricultural products: silk, tea, wool, and tung oil." Democratic figures and national industrialists in Beijing and Shanghai generally believe that this is an important step in the conspiracy of American imperialists to achieve "industrial America and agricultural China," and it is by no means a "matter of unnecessary worry." In short, the activities of these gold-dollar empire pioneers, who are regarded as distinguished guests by the Kuomintang authorities, deserve serious attention.

　　Since the Anti-Japanese War, developing bureaucratic capital has been one of the Kuomintang authorities' established national policies, and after the victory, "taking over" everywhere, the meteoric rise of bureaucratic capital is developing in direct proportion to the famine and bankruptcy in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The bureaucratic capital within the Kuomintang is related to American capital by blood and flesh. The Song and Kung financial groups are typical examples of this comprador bureaucratic capital and are currently the "tycoons" who manipulate the financial lifeline. The bureaucratic capital within the Kuomintang, wearing the "state-owned" coat, is increasingly expanding its exclusive and monopolistic control over light and heavy industries. Now, with the addition of the ubiquitous dumping of large quantities of American goods, China's private industries in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have been pushed to the brink of destruction in this pincer attack!

　　In recent months, news about private industries in Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and other places being unable to sustain themselves, factories closing down, applying for suspension of business, requesting to cut staff and reduce personnel, worker unemployment, etc., has been heard almost every day. Mr. Li Zhuchen, the representative of the industrial and commercial circles of the Political Consultative Conference, recently made a statement on the Kuomintang authorities' letting go and welcoming the dumping of American goods: "The national economy is now on the verge of total collapse, prices are soaring, production is declining, and foreign goods are pouring into the Shanghai market like a flood, with the trend of everything being better if it's American. The government turns a blind eye and even has a hidden intention to welcome it. If there is no improvement in another six months, we can only surrender and wait for death." This remark not only represents the appeal of national capital but also explains to a considerable extent how serious the crisis of American imperialists colonizing China is under the conditions of Chiang Kai-shek's insistence on dictatorship, civil war, treason, and flattery. Today, in the united front of the entire nation struggling for China's independence, peace, and democracy, the national bourgeoisie should and can do something.

　　“文明”的侵略与“伟大”的“出卖”
    漠野
    “倘使称这里是‘外货市朝，大体上是不会错的，除了极少数的例外，每个滩子上出卖的几乎完全是美国货。货品的门类有：西药、钢笔、眼镜、烟斗，香水、火柴、牙膏、尼隆牙刷、鞋油、奶粉、糖浆、电筒、爽身粉、电池、玻璃皮带、玻璃木梳、卡其衬衫、橡皮雨衣、烟匣、饼干、罐头食品、香烟……等等。”这是文汇报记者关于上海四川南路之摊商的特写，从这一个百货杂陈的图景，就不难想见过剩的美国商品，是多么凶猛地在向着黄浦滩乃至全中国泛滥！
    美国对华贸易战前仅占其总输出额的百分之二点五左右，一九四四年前后增至百分之十五，现在已增加到百分之二十了。据六月中旬上海报纸的记载，我国进口与出口货已成十与一之比，而美货竟占上海入口货的百分之七十以上，进口美货总值在七亿美金以上。根据七月上旬的统计：中国的进口货已较出口货多二十倍。这些有形的数字，也就足够惊人了，然而，无形的美货走私，尚未计算在内。沪汛：“六月下旬，美舰杰佛逊马亚号藏有偷税私货。一部分美海军人员，挟带私货，偷漏关税，已成公开秘密。”据广州讯：“美国商品（包括毒品在内）在武装走私下，正大批侵入华南。走私者甚至公开运鸦片烟膏，汽油等，四月间且曾发生从香港偷运汽油（值三千万元）至虎门的武装船只，以机枪扫射缉私者之事。目前粤海关每月税收仅八万万元，逃税达十五万万元之巨。在如此情况下，华南已成美货独占地盘。”看了这些消息，不禁令人又回忆到一九三五年前后日本浪人与“高丽棒子”在华北走私之横行无忌的情景了。
    帝国主义者的对外侵略，除了军舰、大炮、飞机、坦克、吉普车等等以外，还有一个杀人不见血的武器，那便是商品。今天，蒋介石的军队拿着美国的武器在屠杀中国的人民，而大量倾销的美国商品，却同时从中国人民的血肉里榨取着高度的超额利润。
    美国财政资本集团殖民地化中国的手段，不仅是商品输出，而且还有更毒辣的资本输出。在纽约早已成立了一个对华投资的指挥部——“中美工商联合会”，去年已与中国官僚资本订立对华投资、和在华设立四个矿厂、建立公路铁路、派遣专家等控制国民党统治区经济命脉的庞大计划。最近这个计划正在积极进行中，美国的石油、造船、电气、化学、水泥等工厂，行将出现于中国。早在纳尔逊（美国来华经济特使，中国战时生产局首席顾问）来华以后，即曾拟定一个开拓中国的计划，这计划中并没有重工业，其主要一点，就是开拓中国的纺织业。在这一开拓事业中，美资要掌握各公司股份的百分之六十以上（见纳氏论文：《中国能帮助我们》）。这个独占中国棉纺织业的计划，正在中国买办官僚集团的帮助下开始实现。四月下旬，美国两个棉纺织业巨头，正在与中国大买办们计划在华“合作”开办纺织厂。
    美货之所以能够大量地向中国倾销，吞没中国市场，使本来脆弱的中国民族工业陷于目前奄奄一息的危境，归根结柢，不能不归罪于国民党当局之反动的对内对外政策，和一连串出卖国家主权与人民利益的丧权辱国的勾当！
    由于对官僚资本的支持，无限度地鼓励外货进口，外汇始终保持在二○二○元左右的低额汇率，较战前约涨七百倍，而中国物价一般已较战前上涨三千五百倍。因此，美货运沪虽报百分之二十的税，但仍有二倍到十倍以上的利润可图，而价格却仍较中国货物低廉。
    国民党政府现行的关税政策，不仅谈不到保护税则，而且对于外货入口，简直是“引狼入室”的作法。例如“进出口贸易暂行办法”，对于外货入口的一点限制也完全是官样文章，若干种国内可以生产或并不必需的货物，依然不在限制进口之列，相反的，任其大量进口，甚至还有免税的优待。例如前不久一次立法院会议上所提的质问，其中就说到现行课税物品中，啤酒课税而汽水则无，面粉课税，而化妆品如口红脂粉等反无，因此许多可以增加的税收，偏加忽略，任其逃税。
    中央银行管理外汇的大权，也帮助了美国独占资本家的商品输华，因为官僚买办资本可以予取予求的获得外汇，输入美货。中国买办官僚资本和美国帝国主义分子，纷纷组织起无数的进出口公司，如孔祥熙之子的扬子建业公司，宋子文、宋子良的进出口贸易公司、金山公司、立达公司，及美国空军军官陈纳德与中国买办合办的中美实业公司等等，都是美货入口的主要掮客。
    最重要的和最凶恶的帮助美货长驱直入的利器，便是最近京、芜、浔、汉四内港的开放，和全国总税务司与江海关税务司已完全掌握于外人之手。反动的国民党当局的这两个丧权辱国的“杰作”——出卖航权与断送海关自主，已引起了全国航业界与工商业界的忧虑、非难、谴责、与呼吁。
    鸦片战争以后，于咸丰八年（一八五八年）签订天津条约，我以战败国而开放镇江、南京、九江、汉口任外轮通行，与国计民生关系重大的内河航权便从此丧失。远在一九二○年西班牙国际交通会议及一九二一年华盛顿会议，由中国代表团提出议案，希望借新条约的精神，摆脱旧条约的束缚，得以收回航权，但终以弱肉强食，卒至失败。直至一九四三年春，英美废除对华不平等条约，这个久经丧失的航权方得以收回，全国人民欢欣庆祝。曾几何时，在抗战胜利以后的今天，这个由中国人民一百年来的斗争，尤其是八年抗战所争回来的主权，又被以蒋介石为首的反动的国民党当局出卖了！出卖内河航权这件事，是事先经过蒋介石允准，而后由宋子文在国防最高委员会提出通过的。在这里有一点值得特别提出的，就是出卖航权与蒋介石坚持扩大内战有着密切的关联，其著眼点之一在于便利美国军需物资输入内地。
    我国航业在抗战期间业已不绝如缕，现在如何再经得起外籍航业的猛烈竞争？恐不出一年，我国民营航业就会完全破产了。再者，随着内河航权的丧失，外货必然更加汹涌地向内地倾销，从而内地的生产事业也就必然更趋凋弊，其影响国民经济之深重，诚不堪设想。（⑴⑵）
    四口开放以后不久，上海江海关税务司一职，又由总税务司李度（美人）之推荐，经财政部任命英人白查礼担任。海关自主，乃系任何独立国家不可缺少的基本条件之一；自大革命以来，海关自主就一直为中国人民斗争的课题之一。中国各海关税务司从无条约限定非以外人充任不可，至总税务司一席则有非正式约定应由进口总值最多国家之人充任，但亦只有前清总理衙门非正式允许，并未见诸条约；但相沿既久，总税务司应由英人充任遂成“不成文法”了。一九四三年不平等条约废除时，中英新约中曾明白载有英国放弃要求以英人任总税务司之权利，现在总税务司英人梅乐和虽然已经走了，可是，又请来了一位美国人李度，而且将我国第一个贸易港口的海关大权，轻轻地奉送外人掌握。此外，如行政院公布命令，允许外籍船舶可以行驶我国沿海各口岸，装卸货客，出卖沿海口岸间的航权；听命麦克阿瑟的决定，让日本船在中国沿海捕鱼，这些都是开门揖盗，引狼入室。尤其是坚持把中国内政问题的最后决定权交给美国，更属丧心病狂，无耻已极！也只有那个满口仁义道德的“领袖”，才能干得出这样伟大的卖国事业！
    如果说出卖航权断送海关自主是放纵与欢迎外货的“派司”，那么，四月间颁布的“新公司法”就是为外资安排下的温床。根据新公司法的规定：仅以在外国政府特许组织登记，而在中国境内营业者，为外国公司，实即视外人在华设立总公司的公司为中国本公司；外国公司在中国设分公司者，其本国之公司可不营业（拒绝接受国民党统治区人士所主张的最低的限制——外国公司须在其本国营业），则外国公司在其本国可完全免税，其在中国之分公司亦可少报资本以逃税（并且只纳营利所得税，可以不纳股东个人的个别所得税）；中国公司中外人投资毫无限制，外资可以增加至百分之九十六；股份有限公司中除董事长必须为中国人外，其余（如经理、董事等）均无限制。这个新公司法，马寅初先生称之为“美国的贸易法”，委实是一针见血之语。毫无疑义的，美国资本的对华输入，将随着这个新公司法的实施而日益增涨。顷据沪讯：自新公司法颁布后，美国公司商店在沪开设分支店者，迄今据调查已达一百一十五家之多了。
    上月中旬，美国油业巨子现在赔偿专员的鲍莱，率领参谋秘书等三十余人，在我东北各地视察工矿，据说是要“窥东北全貌”。他在抚顺市长欢宴上的答词是：“下车后第一个印象，抚顺如美国之匹茨堡………………本人当努力完成任务。”这位满身石油气的专员的“垂涎欲滴”之情，不难想见。鲍莱随员中之地质学家数人，已在葫芦岛北四十里杨家巷子地方，发现了极丰富的堪称世界最大矿藏之一的钼矿。最近美国环球生产公司已获得在许多地方，特别是戈壁沙漠一带探察与开采石油的权利。所谓“中美农业技术合作团”最近已告成立，美方团员已全部抵沪，其毛织专家已偕国民党西北羊毛管理处长，前往西北各地研究我国毛织事业。美方团长赫契生称：该团“将特别注重研究中国出品之丝、茶、羊毛、及桐油四种农产之改良及增产方法。”京沪各界民主人士及民族工业家，咸认为这是美国帝国主义分子之“工业美国农业中国”阴谋的重要步骤，决非“杞人忧天”之想。总之，这些被国民党当局视为上宾的金元帝国的开拓者们，他们的活动，是值得严重注意的。
    自抗战以来，发展官僚资本是国民党当局的既定国策之一，而胜利以后，到处“接收”，官僚资本的飞黄腾达，更与国民党统治区的饥荒破产，成正比例的发展着。而国民党内的官僚资本，是与美国资本有着血肉关联的，宋财团与孔财团便是这种买办官僚资本的典型，也是目前操纵财政金融命脉的“大亨”。国民党内官僚资本穿了“国营”的外衣，日益扩张着对轻重工业的独占与垄断，现在再加上大量美货之无孔不入的倾销，在这样的夹击中，国民党统治区的民营工业已被推到毁灭的边缘了！
    近几月来，关于上海、重庆、成都、广州、天津等地民营工业无法支持，工厂关门，申请停业，请求裁工减员，工人失业等等的消息，几乎日有所闻。政协工商业界代表李烛尘氏，顷为国民党当局放纵与欢迎美货倾销，发表谈话：“现在全国经济已临总崩溃之前夕，物价高涨不已，生产日趋没落，而外货如狂澜涌进上海市场，大有无货不美之势。政府熟视无睹，且隐有欢迎之意。再有半年无法改进，我们只有授首待毙而已。”这一番话不仅是代表民族资本的呼吁，而且也相当的说明了在蒋介石坚持独裁内战卖国媚外的条件之下，美国帝国主义者殖民地化中国的危机是如何的严重！今天，在为我国独立、和平与民主而斗争的全民族的联合战线中，民族资产阶级应当而且是可以有所尽力的。
