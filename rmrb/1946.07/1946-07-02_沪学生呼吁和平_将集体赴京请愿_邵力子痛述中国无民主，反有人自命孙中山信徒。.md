Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th – According to foreign news agency reports: The Shanghai student community is preparing to collectively go to Nanjing to petition the authorities and Marshall, calling for peace and opposing civil war. According to a spokesman for the student groups: this collective petition will include tens of thousands of male and female students, and if there are no trains to Beijing, they will walk to Beijing. Before the War of Resistance, due to the national traitor Chiang Kai-shek's seeking glory through national betrayal and implementing a policy of non-resistance, handing over the sovereignty of the Northeast and North China to the Japanese invaders, this aroused the Shanghai students to repeatedly go to Beijing to petition, demanding an end to the civil war and unity against foreign aggression. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek fully undermined this patriotic action, hindering the railway bureau from supplying vehicles, and capturing and killing students, preventing them from going to Beijing. Currently, Shanghai students are planning to collectively go to Beijing to petition, demanding an end to the civil war and the implementation of peace and democracy, which will be another great patriotic petition movement of Shanghai students since the Kuomintang reactionaries came to power.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th – Shanghai newspapers reported that on the 4th of this month, Mr. Shao Lizi, while attending a symposium organized by Chinese and foreign figures in Nanjing, delivered a speech stating: For thirty-five years, the Republic of China has been in name only, and many anti-democratic people still claim to be Sun Yat-sen's disciples. Mr. Shao first stated: "What China lacks most is 'the demeanor of democracy.' Although China does not fully possess other conditions of a strong nation, such as education, economy, and transportation, as long as there is democracy, China can gradually become rich and strong." He then said: "The Republic of China has been established for thirty-five years, but for thirty-five years, the Republic of China has been in name only, and democratic obstacles are prevalent throughout China. For two thousand years, the feudal system has been inherited, lurking deeply and spreading widely, and selfishness, autocracy, and brutality have reached their extreme, thus causing the country to split, and as a result of the split, selfishness and autocracy are even easier to develop." Mr. Shao said: "Currently, there are quite a few people in China engaged in anti-democratic work, but anti-democrats dare not openly say that they are anti-democratic, and still claim to be loyal followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen."

　　沪学生呼吁和平
    将集体赴京请愿
    邵力子痛述中国无民主，反有人自命孙中山信徒。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据外国通讯社报导：上海学生界正准备集体前往南京向当局及马歇尔请愿，呼吁和平，反对内战。据学生团体发言人谓：此次集体请愿，将包括成千成万的男女学生，且如赴京无火车，就步行赴京。抗战前，由于国民党蒋介石卖国求荣，实行不抵抗政策，将东北及华北的国土主权拱手让与日寇，当激起沪市学生屡次集体赴京请愿，要求停止内战，一致对外。当时蒋介石对此爱国行动，曾全力破坏，阻碍路局供给车辆，并捕杀学生，阻止学生赴京。目前沪市学生又拟集体赴京请愿，要求停止内战，实行和平民主，当为国民党反动派执政以来沪市学生又一次伟大的爱国请愿运动。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】沪报载本月四日邵力子氏在南京出席一中外人士所组织之座谈会发表演说称：三十五年来，民国有名无实，许多反民主的人还自命为孙中山信徒。邵氏首称：“中国最缺乏者为‘民主的风度’，强国之其他条件，诸如教育、经济、交通等，中国虽未完全具备，但只要有民主中国可渐趋富强”。继谓：“民国成立已三十五年，但三十五年来，民国徒属有名无实，中国全国正普遍存有民主之障碍。二千年来因袭封建制度，潜伏深蔓延广，自私、专制、残暴已达极点，因而使国家以致分裂，而分裂之结果，自私专制乃更易发展”。邵氏谓：“目前中国正有不少人从事反民主之工作，然反民主者不敢明言自己为反民主，仍自命为中山先生之忠实信徒”。
