　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Washington - The long-awaited $3.75 billion U.S. loan to Britain is scheduled to undergo final debate in the U.S. House of Representatives starting on the 8th. The entire debate is allotted 16 hours, four hours per day, with a vote to be held on the fifth day. U.S. government and British Treasury officials anticipate that the vote may pass by a narrow majority. Republican sources estimate that 40 percent of Republican representatives may vote in favor. United Press reporters predict that opponents of the British loan will make their best efforts to propose amendments requiring guarantees for the loan. According to the Anglo-American loan agreement, signed last December, it has been seven months, and the British Parliament has long since approved it. The U.S. Senate did not pass it until May of this year, and the U.S. House Banking Committee did not pass it until mid-June.

　　美国对英贷款问题众院举行最后辩论
    【新华社延安九日电】华府讯：期待已久之美国对英三十七万万五千万元贷款，定于八日起在美众院举行最后辩论，整个辩论时间定为十六小时，每天四小时，第五天进行表决。据美政府与英国财政部官员预料，表决可能以微弱的多数通过之。共和党方面估计该党众议员的百分之四十，可能投赞同票。合众社记者预料对英贷款的反对派，将以最大努力提出修正案，要求对借款的保证。按英美贷款协定，于去年十二月签字，至今已七个月，英国会早已批准。美参院则延至今年五月始通过，美众院银行委员会，亦延至上月中旬才通过。
