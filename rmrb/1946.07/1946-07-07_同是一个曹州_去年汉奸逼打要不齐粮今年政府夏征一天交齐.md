From our Heze correspondent: In the newly liberated areas of Jiluyu, Linze and Heze counties, the emancipated peasants are completing the summer grain collection with unprecedented enthusiasm. The submission of public grain has formed an extremely warm mass competition movement. Linze's wheat levy was originally scheduled to start on June 13th, but the masses in Wuzhuang, District 3, submitted their grain to the village office on June 9th. Everyone said, "We are prepared! Whenever the government wants it, it will be there!" The masses in Yin Shuanghe Village asked the district cadres, "When will we send it? Our village has been ready for a long time!" The masses in Zhang Jian, Lu Gai and other villages said, "Wouldn't it be better to send it a few days earlier?" The village cadres were so anxious that they couldn't sleep, and kept asking the district when it could be collected early. On the 13th, the cadres of more than 50 villages harnessed their carts in the middle of the night. The village chief of Maize Village said, "I harnessed the cart before midnight! Who knew there would be people coming earlier than me!" 230,000 jin of public grain were collected in one day. A tenant farmer from Zhang Village said, "I have been farming and working for others for more than forty years without owning an acre of land. When the Eighth Route Army came, I was liberated and bought several acres of wheat land. I feel happy to pay public grain to the Eighth Route Army! If I harvest more next year, I will pay even more!" The grain delivery movement in Heze City was even more enthusiastic. On the afternoon of the 18th, the streets leading to the warehouse were surging with a dense crowd of people. In front, a brand-new flag was hung, which read: "The government arranged the wheat levy in the morning, and we all completed the task in the afternoon!" Behind the flag, stilt walkers danced, and musicians played joyful songs. Old men, young people, women, children, carts, wheelbarrows, bags, and carrying poles formed a procession of grain delivery. Everyone said, "This year's burden is too light! We are all willing to be the first to deliver public grain!" The 33,800 jin of public grain in the southern district of the city were collected in three hours. The general public opinion of the citizens said: "It's the same Caozhou (Heze). Last year, Wang Wenxian (a traitor) forced and beat people, and he could not collect the supplies in three or four months; this year, with a government call, the people sent all the grain to the warehouse within one day. It can be seen that the people's hearts are turning to us!"

　　同是一个曹州
    去年汉奸逼打要不齐粮今年政府夏征一天交齐
    【本报荷泽讯】冀鲁豫新解放区临泽、荷泽两县翻身农民，正以空前的热情，完成夏粮征收，缴公粮形成了无比热烈的群众性竞赛运动。临泽麦征原规定六月十三号开始，三区武庄群众在六月九号就缴到了村公所。大家说：“准备好！政府啥时要，啥时到！”尹双河村群众见了区干部就问：“啥时送啊！俺村早就准备好了！”张坚、路垓等村群众说：“早送几天不好吗？”村干部急的睡不着觉，光怕缴到别村之后，一直上区打听，看是否能提前收，十三日这一天五十多村干部半夜就套好了车。麦子庄庄长说：“不到半夜俺就套车啦！谁知道还有比俺来得早的！”二十三万斤公粮，一天就收完了。张庄佃户说：“我给人种地扛活四十多年没置下一亩地，八路军一来，我翻了身买了好几亩麦地，给八路军缴公粮心里痛快！明年打多了，我还要多缴哩！”荷泽市缴公粮运动，更是热烈，十八号下午，通仓库的大街上，潮涌着黑压压的人群，前面挂着崭新的旗子，上面写着：“政府上午布置麦征，俺大家下午就完成任务！”旗子后面，高跷跳跃着，吹鼓手吹奏着愉快歌曲，老头子、年青人、妇女、儿童、大车、小车、布袋、担子结成了一条送粮的行列，大家都说：“今年负担太轻了！我们都愿争先缴公粮！”该市南区的三万三千八百斤公粮，三个钟头就缴齐了。市民普遍的舆论说：“同是一个曹州（荷泽），去年王文宪（汉奸）又逼又打，三四个月要不齐给养；今年政府一个号召，老百姓一天之内就把粮都送到仓库去了，可见是民心归向啊！”
