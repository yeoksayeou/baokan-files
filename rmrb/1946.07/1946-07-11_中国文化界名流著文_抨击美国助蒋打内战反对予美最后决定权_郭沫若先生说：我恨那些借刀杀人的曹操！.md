Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Prominent figures in Chinese cultural circles, including Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and dozens of others, have recently published articles in the publications "Shanghai Weekly" and "Democracy," criticizing the U.S. authorities for supporting the Chiang Kai-shek government in conducting a civil war. Guo Moruo said: The Chinese civil war is "fundamentally caused by the U.S.'s China policy. They want to dominate the world and monopolize the market, causing us Chinese to suffer foreign disasters, and they still say we Chinese are committing suicide!... Enough, the Chinese are not all fools. Even if the Chinese really wanted to commit suicide, who provided the weapons! I hate those Cao Cao's who kill with a borrowed knife!" Mao Dun said: "To have peace, we must first ask foreigners to stop helping the Chinese government transport troops and equipment under the banners of 'accepting surrender' and 'repatriating prisoners.'" Xu Guangping, Zhou Jianren, and Zheng Yusen all opposed giving the U.S. the final say, believing that only colonial countries could accept this method. The right to decide how domestic affairs should be handled belongs to the people, how can it be given to the American Marshall! It is believed that one of the fundamental keys to stopping the Chinese civil war is that the United States should not implement a colonial policy of turning China into a base for anti-Soviet activities; from now on, it should stop interfering in China's internal affairs, withdraw its troops, stop lending the government war funds and weapons, and stop helping with military training and transportation." Others, such as Ma Xulun, Zheng Zhenduo, Ai Hansong, Dong Qiusi, Nian Qing, Shi Hui, Zhang Fa, and Guo Gen, all believe that the United States should immediately withdraw its troops stationed in China, no longer assist the Kuomintang in expanding the civil war, and oppose giving the U.S. the final say.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th. Shanghai News: The President of Yenching University, the American Mr. Stuart, expressed his opinions on the current situation to the press, saying: "It is impossible for the Kuomintang army to eliminate the CCP army. The biggest difficulty is the people's impoverishment and lack of food. If there is another civil war, they will no longer support the government. At the same time, the CCP troops have many years of guerrilla experience." He also said: "The people demand peace, which cannot be resolved by fighting. Public opinion cannot be suppressed." Mr. Stuart believes that the Chinese government should include people from all parties and factions to promote socialized politics.

　　中国文化界名流著文
    抨击美国助蒋打内战反对予美最后决定权
    郭沫若先生说：我恨那些借刀杀人的曹操！
    【新华社延安八日电】中国文化界著名人士郭沫若、茅盾等数十人，近在《上海周报》、《民主》两刊物上著文抨击美国当局支持蒋介石政府进行内战。郭沫若说：中国内战，“根本是美国的对华政策在那儿作怪，他们想独霸世界，想独占市场，弄得我们中国人外祸临头，他们还说是我们中国人在自杀！……算了吧，中国人并不都是阿木林，假使中国人真要自杀，是谁给的武器啦！我恨那些借刀杀人的曹操！”茅盾说：“要和平，就必需先请外国人不要再帮中国政府在什么‘受降’，什么‘遣俘’的旗帜下运兵运械了”。许广平、周建人、郑禹森都反对给美方最后决定权，认为只有殖民地国家，才能接受这办法。决定国内的事情应该怎样做的权利，是人民的，岂可送给美国马歇尔！认为制止中国内战根本关键之一，便是美国不施行殖民地、化中国为反苏的基地的政策；从现在起，就停止干涉中国内政，撤退驻军，停止借给政府以战费和武器及帮助军队的训练与运输”。其他如马叙伦、郑振铎、艾寒松、董秋斯、念青、石挥、张伐、郭根等，均认为美国应立即撤退在华驻军，不再助国民党扩大内战，并反对予美方以最后决定权。
    【新华社延安八日电】沪讯：燕京大学校长美人司徒雷登氏，向报界发表对目前时局之意见称：“国民党军要想消灭中共军队，为不可能之事。最大困难，为国内人民之民不聊生，没有饭吃，如果再打内战，他们再不会支持政府。同时，中共部队多年游击，有经验”。又说：“人民要求和平，不是打能解决的，民意是不能压迫的”。司氏认为中国政府应包括各党各派人士，推行社会化之政治。
