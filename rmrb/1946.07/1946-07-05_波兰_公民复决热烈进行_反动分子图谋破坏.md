Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 2nd: According to the Associated Press and other sources from Warsaw: The Polish referendum is still proceeding enthusiastically. All eleven million registered voters are actively involved in the referendum wave. It is understood that the unofficial results of the referendum vote may be announced on July 3rd. The final results will be published within twelve days. During the referendum voting process, Polish reactionaries, uniting with fascist remnants, are carrying out despicable acts of sabotage. According to a statement by the Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman on the 1st: Illegal armed bandits, roaming throughout Poland, have wounded or killed hundreds, even thousands, of government-appointed officials guiding the referendum voting. These terrorists are attempting to disrupt the voting by force. Despite this, Warsaw diplomatic observers predict that although the referendum results are not yet known, the Communist Party and democratic parties will undoubtedly achieve victory.

    公民复决热烈进行
    反动分子图谋破坏
    【新华社延安二日电】据美联社等华沙讯：波兰公民复决仍热烈进行。一千一百万登记选民，都踊跃卷入复决浪潮中。据悉，复决投票的非正式结果，可能在七月三日公布。而其最后结果，将在十二日内发表。在复决投票进行中，波兰反动分子，团结法西斯残余，进行卑鄙的破坏勾当。据波兰外交部发言人一日宣称：流窜波兰各地的非法武装匪徒，已击伤或杀害数百名以至数千名政府所任命以指导复决投票的官员。这些恐怖分子企图以武力破坏投票。尽管如此，据华沙外交观察家预料，复决结果虽尚未确知，但共产党与民主党派无疑将获得胜利。
