　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, July 17th. Alumni of Yenching University in Beiping residing in Zhangjiakou, including Dong ＠ (former Professor of Chinese Literature at Yenching University, also known as Yu Li, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Council), Cui Yulin (former Head of the Biology Department at Yenching University, also known as Lin Ziming, Dean of Studies at North China United University), and 23 others, jointly sent a telegram on the 11th of this month to the new US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, calling for the cessation of US military aid to Chiang Kai-shek to promote peace and democracy in China. The original telegram stated briefly: "We are extremely pleased to learn that our President has been appointed as your country's Ambassador to China. Our President has resided in China for many years and has made significant contributions to the cultural exchange between China and the United States and to the promotion of friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. Now, the Kuomintang authorities are poisoning the people and expanding the civil war, while your country continues to provide military aid to China and maintain US troops stationed in China. This action not only hurts the hearts of the Chinese people but also makes your country subject to the accusation of supporting a tyrant. We hope that our President will convey to your government the urgent need to withdraw US troops from China and repeal the aid to China bill."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, July 17th. Christian friends in Zhangjiakou, including Zhang Beizhen, Pu Huarren, Yuan Yigen, and 23 others, sent a telegram to the new US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, out of Christian friendship, calling for the cessation of the US aid-to-Chiang policy. The original telegram stated briefly: "Your Excellency has preached in China and worked hard in education. During our student days in Shanghai, we personally translated and gained a deep understanding of the true meaning of "Revelation New World". Today, the personnel of the Liberated Areas government are working arduously and selflessly, generously providing for the people, improving the lives of the masses, and allowing all levels of society to enjoy democratic rights. Industry and commerce are flourishing, labor and capital are mutually beneficial, and education is advancing rapidly. This stands in stark contrast to the corrupt bureaucracy and economic bankruptcy in the Kuomintang areas. Now, US-made aircraft are constantly coming to Zhangjiakou for reconnaissance and intimidation, and the reactionary Kuomintang authorities even want to "take over" the Rehe and Chahar provinces, which were won by the blood and flesh of the soldiers and civilians here, in an attempt to plunge millions of people who have already achieved food and clothing back into misery. Your Excellency has been appointed Ambassador to China, and your words carry great weight. You will surely be able to appreciate the pain of all churches praying for peace and convey the peaceful voices of the 400 million Chinese people to the US authorities, so as to realize President Truman's statement last December and the decisions of the Moscow Conference."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 16th. Ning reported: The new US Ambassador to China, John Leighton Stuart, flew to Nanjing from Beiping on the 15th aboard Marshall's special plane.
