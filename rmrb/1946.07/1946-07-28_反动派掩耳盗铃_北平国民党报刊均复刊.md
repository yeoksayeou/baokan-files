　　Reactionaries Bury Their Heads in the Sand
    Kuomintang Newspapers in Beiping All Resume Publication
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th] Beiping News: Of the 77 newspapers and news agencies simultaneously closed at the end of May with the *Beiping Daily* and the New China Branch of the Xinhua News Agency, more than ten Kuomintang official newspapers and periodicals were approved for resumption of publication at the beginning of the month. The newspapers and periodicals that have resumed publication include *Jianguo Daily* (of the Kuomintang Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters), *New China News* (organ of the 11th War Zone Political Department), *National News* (related to the Military Statistics Bureau), China News Agency (related to the Three People's Principles Youth League), *National Daily*, *Jianguo Review*, etc. It is said that when the police carried out the closure order on these newspapers and news agencies, they publicly said: "You are temporarily closed." Last month, Li Weiguo, Deputy Minister of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, came to Beiping for inspection and also stated that except for the left-leaning and "yellow" ones, others could be allowed to resume publication.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 25th] The Wanping Mentougou coal mine, originally liberated by the Hebei-Chahar Eighth Route Army, has been occupied by Chiang's troops. Since June 28th, the Kuomintang county government stationed in Changxindian ordered that from July 1st, each 1,000 catties of coal sold by the town's coal mines must pay a tax of 2 million yuan in legal tender. After this order was implemented for ten days, more than 250 of the town's 300 coal mines were forced to close down because they could not pay the tax, and more than 8,000 workers lost their jobs, accounting for more than one-half of all workers.
