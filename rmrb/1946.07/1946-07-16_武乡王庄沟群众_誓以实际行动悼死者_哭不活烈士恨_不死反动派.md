　　The People of Wangzhuanggou, Wuxiang County
    Vow to Commemorate the Dead with Practical Actions
    "Tears Cannot Resurrect the Martyrs' Hatred, Only the Death of the Reactionaries"
    [This newspaper's Changzhi News] After Comrade Ma Er'ao, militia instructor of the Fourth District of Wuxiang, gloriously sacrificed himself in the "June 18th" tragedy while protecting the masses' wheat harvest in the border area, the men, women, old, and young of Wangzhuanggou were extremely grieved and indignant. Everyone recalled how, during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Ma Er'ao fought the Japanese devils to the death to protect the interests of the masses, and many people wept. On June 20th, the whole village held a solemn memorial meeting. After the chairman reported on the details of Comrade Ma's death and introduced his experiences, old man Chen Xianglin clenched his fist and said: "Tears cannot resurrect the martyrs, only the death of the reactionaries can quench our hatred. We must rise up and fight. I want to go to the front line to join the war and kill more reactionaries to avenge Er'ao!" The militiamen raised their guns and said: "We must fight to the end and avenge our instructor!" The masses and cadres proposed to take good care of Er'ao's family and not let them feel any difficulties. Finally, everyone unanimously decided that we must actively participate in the war and work hard in production to forever commemorate our Comrade Er'ao. Fueled by the flames of revenge, cadres and the masses personally prepared the coffin, carried the remains, and buried Comrade Ma Er'ao.
