Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 28th: Tokyo dispatch: On the 26th, three Chinese civilians testified at the Tokyo Tribunal for Major Japanese War Criminals, powerfully illustrating the horrific atrocities committed by the Japanese army in Nanjing nine years ago. These survivors described how tens of thousands of Chinese civilians were led in groups to the outside of Nanjing's West Gate, and then fell under machine gun fire. Wu Changde testified that as he waited with a large group of Chinese at the West Gate, he saw groups of Chinese civilians ordered to stand on the banks of the canal. They were mowed down by machine guns, and their bodies fell into the canal along the bank. Those not killed by the gunfire were stabbed to death with bayonets. Wu stated that before he himself was to be killed, sixteen groups of people, each with more than a hundred individuals, were shot down. Wu described his escape: "When our group was ordered to walk through the West Gate, I ran for my life and fell down just before the machine guns opened fire. The machine guns didn't hit me, and a Japanese soldier came and stabbed me in the back with a bayonet. I lay there pretending to be dead. After dark, I crawled away along the corpses." He then showed the court the bayonet wound on his back. Shang Deyi, another survivor, gave similar testimony. Chen Fubao, a boy at the time of the fall of Nanjing, testified how he was forced by the Japanese to bury Chinese people alive. He also told the court how many Japanese soldiers surrounded groups of young, strong Chinese men, making them wrestle with the Japanese. Any Chinese man who could not be defeated by the Japanese in wrestling was stabbed to death with a bayonet. As the aforementioned Chinese civilians testified, the entire courtroom audience closed their eyes and covered their ears, unable to bear the testimony. The defendants, upon hearing the accusations of atrocities, all lowered their heads in silence, their eyes downcast. Matsui, the Nanjing military commander at the time, appeared extremely tense.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 28th: Comprehensive Report: After the Tokyo Tribunal for Major Japanese War Criminals resumed trials on the 20th, the first war criminal brought to trial was the executioner of the Chinese people, the head of the secret service, Doihara, accused of being the mastermind behind the Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident. Chinese witness Geng Guoyun of the Nanjing government, and Vice Minister Qin Dechun, were questioned by the Japanese war criminals, who turned the court into an interrogation of this "Chinese General" (as the Associated Press called him). Doihara's defense lawyer tried to get this general to admit: (1) That after the Lugouqiao Incident calmed down, the Chinese side was the first to resume fighting. (2) That before the war, bandits were rampant in North China, so Japan had to increase its troop strength at the garrison there. (3) That according to the Boxer Protocol, Japan had the right to conduct military exercises on Chinese territory without notifying the Chinese government. This was an attempt to prove the legality of Japan's invasion of China. Qin Dechun refused to admit that the Japanese military actions were provoked by the Chinese army, but he failed to give a strong rebuttal. On the 24th, when the defendant's lawyer accused Qin of not answering the question, Qin said, "If you don't listen to my reasons, why did you invite me here to testify?" On the 25th, under continued questioning from Doihara's defense lawyer, Qin angrily ordered the lawyer to shut up. The Associated Press reported: "The lawyer immediately fell silent, then said that because you insist on refusing to answer my questions, I will no longer ask you." The Associated Press also reported: "Former Prime Minister Tojo laughed heartily at the dialogue between this Chinese General and Doihara's lawyer yesterday." According to the Central News Agency, "Qin Dechun has stopped testifying today (the 25th) after being repeatedly questioned by the Japanese and American defense lawyers for four days." The Japanese war criminals also attempted to turn the court into a place for anti-Soviet and anti-communist provocations. On the 25th, Doihara's defense lawyer attempted to show that "the Red Army intended to eliminate the Kuomintang through the Sino-Japanese War, while also eliminating the Japanese army, which was a serious enemy of the Soviet Union," and attempted to prove that "anti-Japanese communists used the Soviet Consulate in Harbin as their headquarters." Although the judge prevented him from talking about Sino-Soviet relations and Chinese domestic issues, he did not fundamentally curb the development of the war criminals' frenzy.

　　东京恢复审判日本战犯
    我国平民出庭作证         
    痛述日军残暴听众均不忍闻
    【新华社延安二十八日电】东京讯：二十六日三个中国平民出席日主要战犯法庭作证，有力地说明了九年前日军在南京的惨酷暴行。这几个死里逃生的人，形容成万的中国平民怎样一群接一群地走到南京西门外，随后在机枪扫射下倒下去。伍长德证明：他与大群的中国人走到西门等待时，他看见一群群的中国平民被命令站在运河岸旁，他们被机枪射倒后，尸体便沿着河岸落在运河里，那些未被射死的人，便被刺刀刺死。伍氏称：在他自己被杀以前，有十六群人被射倒，每一群人有一百多人。伍氏叙述他的脱险称：“当我们这一群被命令走过西门时，我拚命地跑，就在机枪刚刚开火之前我便倒下来，机枪没射中我，日本兵便跑来用刺刀刺我的背，我躺着装死，天黑后，我便沿着死尸爬开”。说着便把背上的刺刀伤给人看。另一个脱险的尚德义，亦作了相同的见证。南京陷落时的一个男孩陈福宝，证明他曾如何被日本人强迫活埋中国人，他又告诉法庭许多日本人围绕着一群年青力壮的中国人，让他们和日本人摔跤，凡是日本人摔不过的中国人，都被刺刀刺死。当上述中国平民作证时，全法庭听众闭目掩耳，不忍听闻，被告听取暴行罪状时，皆低头沉默不语，眼睛望下，当时的南京军司令松井，面部表情至为紧张。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】综合报导：日本主要战犯法庭二十日恢复审判后，首名提审的战犯为中国人民的刽子手、特务头子土肥原，他被控为发动芦沟桥事变的主谋者。中国方面作证人为南京政府耿国云、次长秦德纯，日本战犯竟将法庭变为对此位“中国将军”（合众社如此称呼他）的诘问。土肥原之辩护律师，力欲此位将军承认：（一）芦沟桥事变平静后，中国方面复首先恢复作战。（二）战前华北匪盗猖獗，故日本必须于该地兵站增强兵力。（三）依照庚子条约，日本有权在中国国土演习而不必通知中国政府。这样来企图证明日本侵略中国的合法性。秦德纯拒绝承认日本的军事行动，系由于中国军队的挑衅所激起，但他未能给以有力驳斥。二十四日，当被告律师责秦氏所答非所问时，秦氏称：“汝若不听余陈述理由，则为何邀余来此作证”？二十五日，在土肥原之辩护律师继续诘问下，秦氏乃怒令该律师闭口。合众社称：“该律师当即默不作声，继称因为你坚持拒绝回答我的问题，我即不再问你”。合众社又称：“前日首相东条对于此位中国将军与土肥原律师的对话，曾报以哈哈大笑”。据中央社承认：“秦德纯经日美被告律师四日反复询问后，今日（二十五日）已停止作证”。日本战犯并企图变法庭为反苏反共的挑拨场所。二十五日，土肥原的辩护律师企图显示“红军打算经过中日战争消灭国民党，同时消除作为苏联严重敌手的日本陆军”，企图证明“反日的共产党分子利用哈尔滨苏联领事馆作为总部”。法官虽阻止其谈及中苏关系及中国国内问题，但未根本制止战犯疯狂气焰之发展。
