　　【By Our Correspondent】Under the correct policy guidance and active support of the democratic government, the industry and mining industry in the border region has embarked on a path of prosperity in the past year. The existing coal mines, such as Shigejie in Lucheng, Liuhegou in Anyang, Gongsi Kiln in Shahe, Jiaozuo Coal Mine, Hebi in Tangyin, Fengfeng in Cixian, and Kejing in Jiyuan, are all operated by private individuals, and the production efficiency is very good. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine has increased its daily output by 600 tons; the Kejing Coal Mine, with the active efforts of Mr. Zhai Le'an, the original owner of the coal mine, and the assistance of a 20 million yuan loan from the border government, now produces 800 tons (1.1 million jin) per day. In the coal mine area of more than 100 li in the border mountains of Yangqu, Taiyuan, Qingyuan, Jiaocheng, and Wenshui counties in Central Shanxi, under the common goal of labor-capital unity and development of production, the kiln owners obtain a net profit of about 45% to 55% of the total profit, and the lives of the workers have also been greatly improved. Wang Baoyuan, manager of the Jinzhong Coal Kiln Company, said: "When we were first liberated, I had some concerns, but now I see clearly that the policies of the democratic government completely take care of the interests of both labor and capital." He has raised funds and started construction of kilns, and the total number of coal kilns has now reached 194. In order to increase production and develop the border area industry, both labor and capital of Fengfeng Limin Coal Mine are carrying out a great production competition with high enthusiasm. The company also used 1.2 million yuan in bonuses to reward production labor heroes and model workers. In order to enable the iron industry in more than ten counties in southeastern Shanxi, such as Changzhi, Jincheng, and Lingchuan, to recover rapidly, the border government provided loans of 30 million yuan to assist the capitalists to enable 100,000 iron industry workers to resume work. Various handicrafts well-known in North China in the border area have been restored, such as the fur industry in Daying Town, Zaoqiang, Southern Hebei, Xingtai, and Jining, the textile industry in Weixian and Quzhou, Southern Hebei, the grass braid industry in Qingguan, Southern Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the papermaking industry in Qinshui and Gaoping, the cigarette industry in Nangong, the bamboo industry in Bo'ai, the porcelain industry in Pengcheng, and the medicinal materials in Daheshan Mianshan. Before the war, they were not only sold all over the country, but also sold to the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and other countries. Jinings huazi leather alone could export 4 million sheets every year before the war. After our liberation, the government has provided loans of more than 70,000 yuan (420 million yuan in legal currency) to support its development, and now there are more than 2,000 factories of all sizes, which have been restored and are producing a large number of necessities.

　　年来政府正确指导扶助下
    边区工矿手工业发展
    全区已拥有大小工厂两千余家
    【本报特讯】边区工矿业在我正确的政策指导和民主政府积极扶植下，一年来已走上繁荣的道路。现有的煤矿如潞城石圪节、安阳六河沟、沙河公司窑、焦作煤矿、汤阴鹤壁、磁县峰峰、济源磕井等煤矿，皆由私人经营，生产效率十分良好。焦作煤矿，每日已增产六百吨；磕井煤矿经该煤矿原主翟乐安先生积极努力，加以边府二千万元贷款的资助，现已日产八百吨。（一百一十余万斤）晋中阳曲、太原、清源、交城、文水五县边山绵亘百余里煤矿区，在劳资团结发展生产共同目标下，窑主获纯利占总利润百分之四十五至五十五左右，工人生活也大见改善。晋中煤窑公司经理王保元说：“刚解放时我还有些顾虑，现在看清了民主政府政策，完全是照顾劳资双方利益的。”他已集资动工修窑，现该煤窑总数已达一百九十四座。峰峰利民煤矿为增加生产，发展边区工业劳资双方均以高度热忱开展生产大竞赛，该公司并以一百二十万元奖金，奖励生产劳动英雄及模范工作者。边区政府为使晋东南长治、晋城、陵川等十余县铁业迅速恢复，特贷款三千万，援助资方使十万铁业工人复业。边区驰名华北的各种手工业均告恢复，如冀南枣强大营镇，邢台、济宁等地之皮毛业，冀南威县、曲周的纺织业，长治、冀鲁豫南清观的草帽辫业，沁水、高平的造纸业，南宫的卷烟业，博爱的竹业，彭城的瓷业，大河山绵山的药材，战前不但销售于国内各地，远售于英美苏等国。仅济宁滑子皮，在战前每年可出口四百万张。我解放后，政府曾贷款达七万万元以上（合法币四十二万万元）扶植其发展，现已有各种大小工厂二千余家，重新恢复，大量出产各种必需品。
