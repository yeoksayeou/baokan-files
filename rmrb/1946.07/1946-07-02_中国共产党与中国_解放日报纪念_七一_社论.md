Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. *Jiefang Ribao* published an editorial commemorating July 1st, entitled "The Chinese Communist Party and China." The editorial first pointed out: "The Chinese Communist Party is the political party of the Chinese working class and the political party of the Chinese people, and its purpose is to serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly." Comrade Mao Zedong, with this aim, created the Chinese Communist Party and educated all Chinese Communists. The Chinese Communists were the first to shout the slogans of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism before the Chinese people, and determined the path for the Chinese people to stand up. After the era of the Great Revolution, they defeated the warlords of the Northern Warlords, who were the running dogs of imperialism and feudal forces, in a very short period of time. However, the reactionaries within the Kuomintang, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, colluded with imperialism and combined with feudal forces to carry out "cunning tactics and cruel conspiracies," launching a sudden attack on the Chinese people. But in the philosophy of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong, there is no word "surrender." The Communists and the people were together, preserving the traditions of the Great Revolution in the darkest years, fighting the Kuomintang reactionaries for ten years, training a great people's army, and creating a new dawn for China. After September 18th, the Kuomintang government, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, lost the Northeast and then North China. The Chinese Communist Party, according to the will of the people, launched the War of Resistance Against Japan. Today's China consists of the liberated areas where the Chinese people have defeated the Japanese invaders through self-reliance, and the Kuomintang-controlled areas that rely on foreign forces to support dictatorship. The editorial continued: The Chinese Communist Party is a completely selfless political party, and what it strives for is the happiness of the people. Mao Zedong repeatedly told the Communists that in the places where they are in power, they must use 90% of their energy to give things to the people, and should diligently and earnestly help the people solve their problems of life and production. The combination and mutual trust between the Communist Party and the people can explain the history of the Chinese Communist Party's struggle with the people over the past twenty-five years and China's bright future, and proves that without the leadership and work of the Chinese Communist Party among the Chinese people, there would be no present and future China.

The Chinese Communists believe that China is the China of the Chinese people. The Chinese Communists are willing to cooperate and help each other with all countries on an equal footing in economy and culture, but will never be slaves to any foreign country, will never conclude secret or public treaties with any foreign country that sell out the interests of their motherland, and will never exchange the interests of their motherland for foreign weapons or obtain foreign aid to slaughter and bully their compatriots.

The Chinese Communists advocate democracy, with the people as masters, and the entire Chinese people working together to build a new country.

The Chinese Communist Party advocates that only a free industrial system and a free land system based on private property and protected by the nation can develop national productive forces and lead the country to prosperity and strength.

For twenty-five years, the Chinese Communist Party has fought alongside the Chinese people, forming an invincible and powerful democratic force of the Chinese nation. What should be especially celebrated is that Japanese imperialism was defeated by the Chinese people, the victory of the people in the liberated areas, the self-awakening of the people throughout the country, and the high tide of the democratic movement have demonstrated the rebirth of China, which has become the decisive aspect of the current situation in China and determines the future destiny of China.

However, the Chinese fascists are cruelly attempting to turn China into a protectorate and colony of the United States, turning it into the Philippines and Latin America of the United States. They believe that with foreign weapons and money, they can overwhelm the Chinese people and eliminate the democratic forces in China, especially the Chinese Communist Party. However, the history of the past twenty-five years has shown that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and under the leadership of Mao Zedong, have the power to move mountains and overturn seas. China must continue to move forward and cannot retreat. This is the order of the Chinese people. The Chinese people demand independence and freedom, oppose foreign interference; demand peace, oppose civil war; demand democracy, oppose fascist dictatorship. The Chinese people must realize these sacred demands one by one with their own strength, and the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong are the most courageous and wisest leaders.

The editorial concluded: To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the founding of our party, we must remember that the source of our strength is the Chinese people. Let us unite more closely with all the people! We must continue to work hard to unite all the people to continue to consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-dictatorial united front for peace and democracy. And pointed out that we must be good at learning from Mao Zedong, learning from the masses, and even better at combining these two kinds of learning, and put forward the following slogans:

Without the Chinese Communist Party, there would be no China!

Advance under the banner of Mao Zedong!

Long live China!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Mao Zedong, the savior of the Chinese people!

### 中国共产党与中国  解放日报纪念“七一”社论

　　中国共产党与中国
    解放日报纪念“七一”社论
    【新华社延安三十日电】解放日报发表纪念七一社论，题为“中国共产党与中国”。社论中首先指出：“中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，是中国人民的政党，其宗旨是全心全意为中国人民服务”。毛泽东同志以此宗旨，创造了中国共产党，教育了全体中国共产党员。中国共产党人第一次在中国人民面前喊出反帝反封建，确定了中国人民翻身的道路，经过大革命时代，在很短时期内就打败了当时帝国主义走狗和封建势力的北洋军阀；而以蒋介石为首的国民党内反动派，串通了帝国主义，结合了封建势力，实行“机巧权术与残忍阴谋”，向中国人民突然袭击。但在中国共产党与毛泽东的哲学里面，没有“屈服”两个字，共产党人和人民在一起，在最黑暗的年头，保存大革命传统，与国民党反动派血战了十年，锻炼出一支伟大的人民军队，打出了中国新的光明。九一八以后，以蒋介石为首的国民党政府断送了东北，接着又断送了华北，中国共产党根据人民的意志，发动了抗日战争。今日的中国，一方面是由中国人民自力更生战胜日寇的解放区，另方面是依靠外国力量支持独裁的国民党统治区。社论中继称：中国共产党是完全没有自私的政党，它要争取的是人民的幸福。毛泽东再三告诉了共产党员，在他们当权的地方，必须用百分之九十的精力向人民以东西，应该勤恳切实的去帮助人民解决生活问题和生产问题。共产党与人民的结合和互相信任，才能说明二十五年来中国共产党与人民斗争的历史与中国光明的前途，证明了没有中国共产党在中国人民中的领导和工作，便没有现在和将来的中国。
    中国共产党人认为中国乃是中国人的中国，中国共产党人愿意和各国在经济上、文化上平等合作互助，但决不当任何外国的奴隶，决不和任何外国订立出卖自己祖国利益的密约或公开条约，决不拿祖国的利益去交换外国的武器，取得外国的援助来屠杀和欺侮自己的同胞。
    中国共产党人主张民主，由人民作主，由全体中国人民合作建设新国家。
    中国共产党主张只有以私有财产为基础，又为民族所保护的自由工业制度和自由土地制度，才能发展民族生产力，致国家于富强。
    二十五年来，中国共产党和中国人民在一起的战斗，已凝成中国民族不可战胜的强大的民主力量。特别应该庆祝的，日本帝国主义被中国人民所打败，解放区人民的胜利，全国人民的自我觉醒和民主运动的高潮，表现了中国的新生，成为今天中国时局决定的方面，同时又是决定着中国将来的命运。
    但是中国法西斯派正在狠心地企图把中国变成美国的保护国和殖民地，变成美国的菲律宾和拉丁美洲，他们以有外国武器与金元便可压倒中国人民，消灭中国民主力量，首先是中国共产党。然而，二十五年来的历史，说明了中国人民在中国共产党领导下，在毛泽东的领导中，是有移山倒海的力量，中国必须继续前进，不能后退，这是中国人民的命令。中国人民要求独立自由，反对外国干涉；要求和平，反对内战；要求民主，反对法西斯独裁。这些神圣的要求，中国人民一定要用自己的力量把它一一实行，而中国共产党和毛泽东便是最勇敢最智慧的带路者。
    社论中最后指出：纪念我们党诞生二十五周年，要记住我们力量的源泉，乃是中国人民，让我们更亲密的和全体人民结合在一起吧！我们要继续努力，团结全体人民继续巩固与扩大反帝反封建反独裁的和平民主统一战线。并指出我们要善于向毛泽东学习，向群众学习，更要善于把这两种学习结合起来，并提出以下口号：
    没有中国共产党，就没有中国！
    在毛泽东的旗帜下前进！
    中国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的救星毛泽东万岁！
