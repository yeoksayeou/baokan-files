            (1) After the resumption of the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference
    The Paris Foreign Ministers Conference, which is discussing the draft peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, resumed on the 15th after a month-long recess.
    During the recess of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the American and British reactionaries actively worked to create a tense situation in the relationship between the three powers. Vandenberg, the head of the American isolationists, wildly demanded no compromise with the Soviet Union, and the Associated Press and Washington reporters wanted to present the Soviet Union with a "real ultimatum." The British Conservative Party's Daily Mail declared that the settlement of international relations must be completed without the participation of the Soviet Union. American and British, especially American, pro-fascist elements tried to use the discord between the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom to break the relationship between the three powers. They tried their best to get the government authorities to take a consistent anti-Soviet coordination with them. Under such circumstances, the foreign ministers of the three countries expressed their attitudes. U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, in a speech on the 20th of last month, declared that he would launch a "peace offensive" and put forward new threatening plans to submit the draft treaties that had not reached agreement at the Foreign Ministers Conference to the United Nations for discussion. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov issued a statement on the 28th of last month, presenting to the world the true picture and nature of the differences at the Foreign Ministers Conference and criticizing Byrnes' speech. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also delivered a speech on June 4, still adhering to his original position on important issues; but at the time he also expressed his willingness to make some concessions. He also worried about the possible bad consequences of the next meeting if it was in a deadlock - these were the circumstances before the resumption of the Foreign Ministers Conference.
    It has been ten days since the resumption of the Foreign Ministers Conference. The procedural issues that had caused considerable difficulties in the past were quickly resolved. In addition to the issue of the five-nation treaty, the German and Austrian issues raised by the United States were formally put on the agenda, and the issue of the current political situation in Italy raised by the Soviet Union will also be discussed. On the discussion procedure of the Italian peace treaty, the suggestion made by the Soviet Union to first discuss the economic clauses of the Italian peace treaty was also adopted. Partial agreements were reached on the economic clauses of the Italian peace treaty, and the remaining opinions were closer than before. Agreements have also been reached on the withdrawal of British and American troops from Italy and the establishment of a committee to supervise the implementation of the Italian peace treaty. Regarding the issue of Italian colonies, one of the main differences in the last meeting, the meeting is moving towards resolving it on schedule so as not to hinder the signing of the treaty. As for another major difference - the Trieste issue - it is still under debate. The French side has put forward a compromise plan. Regarding the treaties of Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary, the assistant foreign ministers have completed the agreement during the recess, and only the Danube issue remains to be dealt with by the Foreign Ministers Conference. Therefore, looking at the progress of the meeting in the past ten days, although it is too early to estimate the results after the meeting, the hope of reaching an agreement on the issue of the five-nation treaty has increased compared to before. At present, the four foreign ministers have agreed to speed up work and hold secret meetings (which is conducive to seeking compromises in fierce requests), which is earlier in terms of time than the last meeting. The Soviet delegation has stated that they have come to Paris this time to solve the problem and are willing to make major concessions in order to reach an agreement; and in fact, they have done so in the past ten days.
    Naturally, concessions must be mutual. This Foreign Ministers Conference is not without any difficulties; on the contrary, there are many difficulties, and they are quite serious. In addition to the Trieste issue, there are still major differences between the three powers on the German issue and the Austrian issue. It is entirely predictable that fierce disputes will break out on these issues. Recently, the American delegation has again proposed that the issue of the peace conference proposed by the four foreign ministers be submitted to the twenty-one-nation peace conference that must be convened before July 15. This is a violation of the principle of unanimous agreement and is undoubtedly detrimental to the progress of the Foreign Ministers Conference. Moreover, as long as people remember Byrnes' speech during the recess, before and after the resumption of the meeting, the American authorities suddenly submitted to Congress the "Continuing Military Aid to China Act" to interfere in China's internal affairs, and proposed to the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China the so-called draft agreement on the twenty-five-year disarmament of Japan, and at the beginning of the resumption of the meeting, some American reactionaries shouted loudly and adopted a permanent deadlock policy, then it is not difficult to understand that the Foreign Ministers Conference may have to overcome some difficulties in reaching an agreement on some major issues, such as the issue of the five-nation treaty. And after the Foreign Ministers Conference, serious disputes over the unresolved issues are still inevitable.

            （一）巴黎外长会议复会以后
    讨论对意、罗、保、匈、芬和约草案的巴黎外长会议，在休会一月之后，已于十五日复会。
    外长会议休会期间，美英反动派曾积极活动，使三强关系曾呈紧张的局面。美国孤立派的头子范登堡，狂忘不要对苏妥协，合众社和华盛顿记者，要对苏提出“真正的最后通牒”。英国保守党的每日邮报，扬言国际关系的解决必须不要苏联参加而完成之。美英，特别是美国的亲法西斯分子，力图用苏美英的不协调，以使三强关系陷于破裂。他们极力争取政府当局和他们采取一致的反苏协调。在此种情况下，三国外长表明了态度。美国务卿贝纳斯，于上月二十日的演说中，声言要发动“和平攻势”，并提出新的威胁计划，要将那些在外长会议上没有达到协议的和约草案，提交给联合国组织去讨论。苏外长莫洛托夫于上月二十八日发表谈话，向全世界提示了外长会议上分歧问题的真象与性质，并批驳了贝氏的演说。英外相贝文亦于六月四日发表演说，在重要问题上，仍固执原来的立场；但当时又表示愿作若干让步。并忧虑下次会议如陷僵局时可能产生的恶果——这些就是外长会议复会前的情况。
    此次外长会议复会，迄今已经旬日。在过去曾引起相当大的困难的程序问题，迅速获得了解决。除五国和约问题外，并将美国所提德国问题与奥国问题正式列入议程，苏联提出的意大利目前政治形势问题，亦将予以讨论。关于对意和约的讨论程序会上，也通过苏联所提首先讨论对意和约中经济条款的建议。关于对意和约中的经济条款，获得了部分协议，所余之意见也较前接近。关于英美驻军自意撤退，及组织监督对意和约实施的委员会，亦已获得协议。对于上次会议中主要分歧之一的意殖民地问题，会议趋向于使之准期解决，以免阻碍和约的签订。至于另一主要分歧——的里雅斯特问题，则仍在争论中。法方已提出了折衷方案。对罗、保、匈三国和约，各外长助理于休会期间，已完成协议，仅余多瑙河问题，尚待外长会议处理。因此，综观十天来会议的进行，虽然要估计其会后结果尚嫌过早，但是对五国和约的问题达到协议的希望，已较前增长了。目前四外长对于加紧工作，及召开秘密会议（这有利于彼此在激请中寻求妥协）的议定，就时间上说，已较上次会议提前。苏联代表团已声明此次到巴黎来，是为了解决问题，并愿作重大让步，以求得协议；而且十天来实际也这样做了。
    自然，让步必须是双方的。这次外长会议，并不是没有任何困难；相反的，困难是不少，而且是相当严重的，除了的里雅斯特问题外，三强对德国问题和奥地利问题，仍存在着重大分歧。在这些问题上，爆发激烈的争执，是完全可以预料得到的。日前美国代表团又已提议，将四外长已提议的和平会议的问题，提交必须在七月十五日以前召开的二十一国和会讨论，这是违反了一致协议的原则的，无疑是不利于外长会议的进行。而且人们只要记忆起在休会期间，贝纳斯的演说，在复会前后，美国当局突然向国会提出干涉中国内政的“继续对华军事援助法案”向苏英中提出所谓对日二十五年解除武装协定草案，以及在复会之初，美国某些反动分子大叫大嚷，采取永久僵局政策，那末就不难了解外长会议对某些主要问题，如对五国和约问题的取得协议，也许须克服若干困难。而在外长会议之后，对于未获协议诸问题的严重争论，仍是不可避免的。
