    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd] Shanghai News: The shocking grain loan scandal exposed here has, according to various materials, revealed that the main players in the fraud are the big bureaucrats and tycoons within the Kuomintang. According to the indictment submitted by Cheng Zhonghang, the Jiangsu Provincial Inspector, the individuals involved include Yang Xi, Special Commissioner for Grain Administration in Shanghai under the Ministry of Food; Wang Daren, Commissioner of the Ministry of Food, Secretary of the Special Commissioner's Office, and Acting Director of Affairs; Ren Xingya, Chief of the Regulation Section; as well as Li Chongnian, Director of the Field and Grain Department of the Ministry of Food, Special Commissioner for the Southeast Region, and Chairman of the Yangtze River Grain Storage and Transportation Committee; and Wan Molin, Chairman of the Bean and Rice Trade Association. In April, the Kuomintang authorities handled grain loans of 940 million yuan in Shanghai, all proposed by Li Chongnian, Wan Molin, and others, and lent to the aforementioned sixteen firms. Under their manipulation, the price of rice in May increased by as much as 30,000 yuan in a matter of days. Furthermore, according to Wang Daren's confession, all of his actions were dictated by Xu Kan, the Minister of Food and confidant of Kong Xiangxi.

　　沪粮贷舞弊案暴露
    国民党官僚财阀是主角
    【新华社延安二十三日电】沪讯：此间暴露的惊人粮贷舞弊案，现经各方材料，说明舞弊的主要角色，乃是国民党内大官僚财阀们。据江苏省监察使程中行的检举书中所列出的有关人员，有粮食部上海市粮政特派员杨锡，粮食部专员兼特派员办公处秘书、代理处务汪达人，调节科科长任星崖，暨粮食部田粮署署长兼东南区特派员长江区粮食储运委员会主任委员李崇年、豆米业公会理事长万墨林，有关的行号包括长江公司及江北、东益等十六家公司。国民党当局于四月间在沪办理了九万万四千万元的粮食贷款，悉由李崇年、万墨林等提出，出贷给上述十六家行号。在他们的操纵之下，五月间米价在数日之内增涨达三万元之巨。另据汪达人供称，他的一切作为都是听命于孔祥熙亲信粮食部长徐堪的。
