　　Liu Lianze Does Not Implement Wage Increase Contract
    Shop Assistants Win Struggle Again
    Changzhi City Trade Union Calls for Inspection of Wage Increases
    [Report from our Changzhi Office] Liu Lianze, manager of Shunji Store on South Street, Changzhi City, aroused opposition from shop assistants for failing to pay wages according to the contract. For example, Li Jiesan, a shop assistant, agreed to a monthly wage of 700 yuan this spring, which was equivalent to five dou of millet at the time. On June 13th, Jiesan's father came to settle three months' wages, but Liu Lianze only gave him a total of 1,500 yuan in silver dollars. Jiesan's father pointed out that this was not enough according to the contract, and that the price of grain had risen again. However, Liu not only refused to pay but also threatened to fire him. On June 16th, all the shop assistants reasoned with Liu Lianze, and Liu accepted on the spot, saying that he would convert the payment according to the market price of five dou of rice. However, he did not implement it after the meeting. Recently, under the leadership of the trade union, after two rounds of reasoning and struggle, it was thoroughly implemented.
    After this incident, the Municipal Trade Union immediately called for an inspection of whether the wage increase had been implemented and whether there were any cases of apparent increases but actual non-increases.

　　刘连则不执行增资合同
    店员再次斗争获胜
    长治市工会号召检查增资
    【本报长治讯】长治市南街商店顺记号经理刘连则，因不按合同规定发给店员工资，引起店员们反对，如店员李捷三，今春立约每月工资七百元，当时折小米五斗，六月十三日，捷三的父亲来算三个月工资，刘连则却一共只给大洋一千五百元。捷三父亲提出按合同还不够，且粮食又涨价，但刘不但不给，且以解雇相威胁。六月十六，全体店员向刘连则展开讲理，刘当场接受，说按五斗米市价折钱。但会后又不执行，最近在工会领导下，经过二次说理斗争，才彻底执行了。
    此事发生后，市职工会当即号召检查增资是否贯彻，检查是否有明增暗不增现象。
