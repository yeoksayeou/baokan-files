　　Record of the Northward Withdrawal of the Dongjiang Column
    Chen Fan
    On the morning of June 30th, two thousand four hundred armed personnel of the Chinese Communist Party in the Dongjiang area of Guangdong departed from the turbulent Dapeng Bay aboard three giant American landing craft, heading north to Yantai, Shandong.

    The Rippling Countryside
    When this reporter arrived at Kuiyong in Dapeng Bay on June 22nd, all the CCP armed personnel on the south and north banks of the Dongjiang had entered the final assembly point. They were not concentrated in one place, but scattered in many villages within the area of the final assembly point. Some places were even twenty or thirty miles away from the designated center and the eighth group located in Kuiyong. CCP personnel made it clear that this was because past lessons had compelled them to be cautious about security issues. During the final assembly stage, although Kuiyong was the command center, the boarding preparations of the CCP armed personnel were carried out calmly and intensely. Therefore, although armed personnel were constantly coming and going, the villages maintained a solemn quiet, because they complied with the agreement not to conduct any propaganda.

    Why the Northward Withdrawal?
    The CCP armed personnel seen in Kuiyong, apart from the upper-level cadres, both men and women, were mostly people under the age of twenty-five. About one-tenth of them were "little devils" under the age of ten. Some were only as tall as a rifle, but were already machine gunners. They carried machine guns on their shoulders and marched proudly, not feeling tired at all. Among the armed personnel were not only men but also women. They carried hand grenades, had short hair, and went barefoot, enduring hardships and fighting like men. In the team, they ate the same food as men, received a monthly living allowance of six hundred yuan, nine taels of rice per meal, forty yuan for non-staple food, two qian of oil, and half a catty of extra meat and half a catty of fish per month. They had opportunities to work as company commanders and commanders, and they had equal work opportunities with men. When it came to politics, these young men and women, including the "little devils," all had a level of common sense. If you asked any male or female member, "Why the northward withdrawal?" they would answer without hesitation, "For the peace of Guangdong?!" If you talked further, they would tell you a series of reasons.

    One "little devil" named Wang Jing, a native of Dapeng, joined the "Dongjiang Column" three years ago because the Japanese attacked his hometown and raped his aunt. He joined to resist the enemy and seek revenge. For the past few years, he has been doing political work and has become a very good "little devil." He can criticize current affairs in China and speak eloquently. Their clothes are ragged, and their weapons are mixed and uneven. There are pistols, rifles, light and heavy machine guns, American submachine guns, grenade launchers, and homemade cannons. Some of these weapons were seized from battles with the Japanese. Every gun and every bullet is cherished by them. It was precisely because of the ragged clothes and messy weapons that government personnel still underestimated their strength in the end. However, all the CCP armed personnel themselves have strong self-confidence. When General Zeng Sheng summarized the experience of the past eight years on the beach of Shayuchong, he said, "The reason why the Dongjiang Column can exist and develop under difficult circumstances is because it is integrated with the people, and it can be integrated with the people because it is resisting Japan. And the people's demand is also to resist Japan."

    In the early days, the members of the Dongjiang Column were mostly educated youths. According to a student of National Sun Yat-sen University, "At the most, there were about three hundred students from 'Sun Yat-sen University'." After the fall of Hong Kong, it absorbed a group of outstanding workers. Later, because it took root in the rural people, it absorbed a large number of rural youths. Until the Japanese surrender, including combat personnel and rural self-defense forces, there were more than ten thousand people. Since the victory, some personnel have been demobilized. Therefore, the personnel concentrated in Dapeng Bay for this northward withdrawal, including a small number of family members, numbered only about three thousand two hundred people. Among them, except for two thousand four hundred people going north, all were demobilized. The demobilized personnel were listed by the CCP and sent to the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters for the record, and it was hoped that the Pacification Headquarters would "provide security guarantees" in accordance with the agreement.

    The Demobilization Problem
    The demobilization problem gave the person in charge of the Dongjiang Column more trouble than the northward withdrawal problem, such as who should withdraw north and who should be demobilized. Especially burdensome was the work of persuading those who requested to withdraw north themselves, but whom the person in charge estimated were suitable for demobilization, and those who should go north but had many problems making it difficult to go north. They organized a demobilization work committee to handle the demobilization problem. The important basis for the northward withdrawal and demobilization was still based on the members' awareness, followed by the upper-level plan. According to the CCP, General Zeng said, "Generally, each demobilized person is given a demobilization fee of 30,000 yuan, and those who travel too far will be given more." He said that the CCP plans to withdraw some money to run several farms in the New Territories of Hong Kong and Kowloon to accommodate some demobilized personnel for self-sufficiency in production; some will try to introduce work, and the rest will return home to farm. Regarding returning to farming, he said, "But it also depends on whether the government can really give them security guarantees?" The CCP seems to still have great concerns about the safety and livelihood of the demobilized personnel.

    How Many Scenes of Joy and Sorrow?
    Whether it was armed personnel from the south or north of the Yangtze River or from northern Guangdong, they were particularly busy when they arrived at the final assembly point. The headquarters also allocated time for some personnel to meet with family members who came from afar. This human arrangement was full of joy and sorrow. The headquarters specially set up a family guest house in a three-story building in Kuiyong. When this reporter arrived, there were more than two hundred people living there. Some of them came to find husbands they had not seen for a long time, and more came to find sons and daughters they had not seen for a long time. They brought gifts such as sweet potatoes, chickens, ducks, eggs, and peanuts. When they met, both sides shed tears first. "Revolution" and "family" were fighting stubbornly there.

    Tears Under Mount Luofu
    General Zeng Sheng envisioned the work after arriving in Yantai as follows: "After eight years of hard struggle, we need to rest, summarize the experience of the past eight years, and strengthen learning and training." The cadres of the Dongjiang Column believed that after arriving in Shandong, they would not directly participate in military battles. Even a "little devil" said, "These two thousand four hundred people are Guangdong's capital, and the Party will definitely not use them casually." I asked them, "Do you miss Guangdong?" Han Jiyuan, who once served as the county magistrate of Boluo, said: "No matter what the outside criticism is, this is, after all, the land where we grew up. We have sown seeds, bloomed flowers, and borne fruit here, so of course we miss it. When I walked down Mount Luofu, I turned back and looked, and tears burst out!"

　　东江纵队北撤记
    陈凡
    广东东江中共武装人员二千四百人于六月三十日晨分乘美国巨型登陆艇三艘，离开了波涛汹湃的大鹏湾向山东烟台北撤。
    波动中的乡村
    记者于六月二十二日到达大鹏湾上的葵涌时，东江南岸和东江北岸全部的中共武装人员已进入最后集中地。他们并不是集中在一个地方，而是在最后集中地的范围内分散在许多村庄里。有些地方甚至离开指定中心及第八小组所在的葵涌二三十里，中共人员明白表示，这是因为过去的教训使他们对于安全问题不得不作谨慎的考虑的缘故。在最后集中阶段，葵涌虽是指挥中心，但中共武装人员的登船准备工作，是在沉着和紧张中进行的，所以武装人员虽不断的往来，但各村仍保持着严肃的静穆，因为他们遵守协议不得作任何宣传。
    为什么要北撤
    在葵涌所看到的中共武装人员，除了上层干部男男女女以外，多数是二十五岁以下的人，其中大约十分之一都是十几岁以下的“小鬼”，有些只有一枝步枪这么高，便已经是机关枪射手，他们肩上放着机关枪雄纠纠的跑路，一点也不觉得累。武装人员中不但是男的，也有女的，她们带着手榴弹，短发赤脚与男性一样吃苦和战斗，在队里她们与男子吃同样的饭，每月领生活费六百元，每餐九两米，副食费四十元，油二钱，每月加菜肉半斤，鱼半斤。她们有当中队长的与当指挥员的，她们与男子有平等的工作机会。谈到政治，这些年青的男女连“小鬼”在内都有常识的水准。随便问一个男女队员：“为什么要北撤？”他们都会毫不迟疑的答复你：“是为着广东的和平？！”再谈下去他会为你说出一连串的道理。
    一位小鬼名字叫做王景，是大鹏人，三年前日本人攻到他的乡下，强奸了他的婶婶，他为着抗敌复仇参加了“东江纵队”，这几年来他都是做政权工作，已经成了一个很好的“小鬼”。他能批评中国时事，都说得头头是道。他们的衣服是褴褛的，他们的武器是参杂不齐的，有手枪，有步枪，有轻重机枪，有美式冲锋枪、有掷弹筒、有土炮，这些武器有些是从与日本人的战斗中夺得的。每一枝枪，每一颗子弹，都被他们爱惜着。就因为衣服褴褛和武器杂乱，使政府人员到最后还是轻视他们的力量。但中共武装人员自己则全部都有坚强的自信，曾生少将在沙鱼涌的海滩，为记者总结八年来的经验时说：“东江纵队之所以能够在艰苦的情形下存在和发展，是因为他是与人民结合的，而所能与人民结合，则是因他是抗日的。而人民的要求也是抗日。”
    东江纵队的成员在初期多是知识青年。据一个国立中山大学的学生说：“最多的时候，‘中大’同学就有三百人左右。”香港沦陷后，吸收了一部分优秀的工人，其后因在乡村民众里生了根，又吸收了大部分的农村青年，直到日本投降止，连战斗人员及乡村自卫队在内，共有一万多人，自胜利后，一部分人员已进行复员，因之，这次为北撤集中到大鹏湾的人员，连小部家属在内，只有三千二百人左右，其中除二千四百人北上外，均一律复员。复员人员由中共造具名册，送交广州行营备案，并希行营照协议”，予以安全保障。
    复员问题
    复员问题所给予东江纵队负责人的烦恼，比北撤问题还复杂，那些人应该北撤，那些人应该复员的问题。尤其繁重的，是对于那些他自己要求北撤，而负责者估计他适宜于复员的人，和那些应该北去但又拖着不少问题难于北上的人的说服工作，他们组织了复员工作委员会负责处理复员问题。北撤与复员重要的根据，还是依据于成员的自觉，其次就是依据上层的计划，据中共方面，曾少将说：“复员人员一般的每人发给复员费三万元，路途过远的多发一些。”他表示中共拟抽出一部分钱，在香港九龙新界方面办几个农场，收容一部分复员人员，生产自给；一部分则设法介绍工作，其余回家的回家，归农的归农。对于归农，他说：“但也要看政府是否真的能给他们以安全保障？”中共方面对于复员人员安全和生居似乎还留着很大的忧虑。
    多少悲欢场面
    无论江南江北和粤北部分武装人员，一到了最后集中地，就特别忙着。司令部还为一部分人员分配时间，让他们和远道而来的家属会面，这人情的布置充满了悲欢。司令部特别在葵涌的一座三层的楼房里，设了一个家属招待所，记者到的时候，那里住了二百多人，她们有些是来找久别的丈夫的，更多的是来找久别的儿女的，他们携来了红薯、鸡鸭、鸡蛋、花生等礼物，一见了面双方面都先流下了眼泪。“革命”与“家庭”在那里作顽强的争斗。
    罗浮山下之泪
    曾生少将对到烟台后的工作是这样的想象：“经过了八年的苦斗，我们要休息一下，总结一下八年来的经验，再加强学习，加强训练。”东江纵队的干部都相信到了山东之后，他们不致直接参加军事战斗，一个“小鬼”也说：“这二千四百人是广东的资本，党一定不随便使用。”我问他们“留恋广东吗？”曾任博罗县长的韩继元说：“不论外面的批评如何，这里无论如何是我们生长的土地，我们在这里播过种，开过花，结过果，当然是留恋的。当我走下罗浮山的时候，返身回望，眼泪轰流出来了！”
