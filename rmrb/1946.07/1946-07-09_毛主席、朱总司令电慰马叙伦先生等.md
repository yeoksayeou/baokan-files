Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 5th: After news of the Xiaguan Massacre reached here, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu immediately sent a telegram of condolences to Mr. Ma Xulun and others who were injured in the massacre. The original telegram is published as follows:

To Comrade Zhou Enlai in Nanjing, please forward to Mr. Ma Xulun, Jian Yanfang, Zhang Choubo, Bao Dasan, Sheng Pihua, Wu Yaozong, Yan Baohang, Lei Jieqiong, Chen Zhenzhong, and Chen Lifu, representatives of Shanghai people's organizations:

You, representing the people of Shanghai, marched for peace, but were surrounded and beaten by fascist thugs. This shows that warmongers are willing to isolate themselves from the people. The Chinese Communist Party has always adhered to the policy of peace and democracy, and is determined to unite with the people of the whole country to fight for peace and prevent civil war. We send our condolences and hope you take care!
