　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 2nd: As American authorities become increasingly active in assisting the Kuomintang dictatorial government, the opposition movement among American peace and democratic figures is also growing. According to Shanghai's *China Weekly Review*, Congressman DeLacy stated in the House of Representatives in mid-June: "Withdraw our Marines from Qingdao! If we do not withdraw, we will be drawn into another war. This time, we are helping the Chinese dictatorial government fight the Chinese forces of freedom." Also, according to news from New York: The American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy announced to the nation: "Be wary of lending money to the Chinese authorities to fight a civil war." The committee also stated: "If 500 million is lent to the current non-representative, centralized government of China, then every penny in the financial plan will be used for civil war." In a letter to President Truman, the committee also requested that he immediately implement his own statement of December 15th of last year that no loans should be given to the Chinese authorities unless China has a united government. The letter pointed out: "If the United States becomes an instrument for prolonging the civil war that has already caused us to lose prestige in the East, the hatred that the Chinese have felt will rise to replace friendship." The letter also reminded President Truman that the $500 million lent to the Chinese government before the end of the war against Japan not only failed to stabilize inflation but also helped senior corrupt officials acquire large amounts of wealth. According to Moscow Radio: When the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill last month, it aroused dissatisfaction among some members. Committee member Pace stated: "We hope that after the end of the war, the United States should withdraw all overseas troops. However, the United States has sent naval fleets and Marines to China, which has caused us unease and anxiety."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 2nd: Moscow, July 2nd broadcast: The New York *Worker's Daily* published an article by Stollent on June 2nd, exposing the sinister intentions of American imperialists to interfere in China's internal affairs. The author first pointed out that the United States has already implemented general armed interference in China's internal affairs. The author said: Manchuria has attracted great attention from American imperialists. American imperialists have always regarded China as their own sphere of influence. American generals and big businessmen are trying to seize 70 percent of China's industry in the fertile Manchurian Plain and acquire strategically important positions.

　　美国和平民主人士反对政府当局助蒋
    主撤退驻华美军不贷款国民党政府
    【新华社延安二日电】随着美国当局援助国民党独裁政府的日趋积极，美国和平民主人士的反对运动亦正增长中。据上海《中国评论周报》载、美国众议员德拉西，六月中旬在众议院中宣称：“把我们的海军陆战队撤离青岛吧！如果我们不撤退，我们就将卷进又一次战争中。这一次是我们帮助中国独裁政府，打中国自由势力。”又据纽约讯：美国远东民主政策委员会，曾向全国宣布：“警戒借款给中国当局打内战”。该委员会并称：如以五万万借给目前中国非代议的集权政府，那么在财政计划中的每一分钱，都要用在内战上。”在给杜鲁门总统的信中，该委员会并要求他立即实行去年十二月十五日他自己的声明，除非中国有一个联合政府，不能贷款给中国当局。这封信指出：“假若美国变成了延长使我们已在东方失去威信的内战的工具，中国人已感觉到的仇恨将要起而代替友谊。”这封信还提醒杜鲁门总统说，在抗日战争未完时，借给中国政府的五万万美元，不但未能稳定通货膨胀，反而助长高级贪官取得大量财富。另据莫斯科广播称：美众院外委会上月二十四日在讨论军事援蒋法案时，引起了某些委员的不满。该委会委员配斯培持声明说：“我们希望在战争完结之后，美国应撤回一切海外军队。但美国却派遣海军舰队及陆战队到中国，这就引起我们的不安与焦虑的。”
    【新华社延安二日电】莫斯科二日广播：纽约工人日报六月二日登载斯托伦特一文，揭露美国帝国主义分子干涉中国内政的阴险目的。作者首先提出美国已实行一般的武装干涉中国的内政，作者说：满洲引起美国帝国主义者的极大注意，美国帝国主义者向来是把中国看成是自己的势力范围，美国将领与大商人力图在肥沃的满洲平原侵占中国工业百分之七十的满洲，取得具有战略意义的阵地。
