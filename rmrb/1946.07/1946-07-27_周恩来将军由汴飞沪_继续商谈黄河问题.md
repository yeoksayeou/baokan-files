　　General Zhou Enlai Flies from Bian to Shanghai
    Continuing Discussions on the Yellow River Issue
    [This newspaper's Heze, 23rd dispatch] CPC representative General Zhou Enlai, for discussing the Yellow River issue, flew from Shanghai to Bian on the 19th. Yellow River management representatives from the Jilu Yu liberated area, Wang Xiaoyi and Cheng Run, accompanied him. On the same day, they inspected the blocking project at the Garden Mouth. On the 20th, they attended a symposium on the Yellow River issue in Bian. Participants included representatives from the Jilu Yu and Bohai liberated areas, such as Wang Huayun, Guan Datong, and Liu Jiqing, as well as personnel from the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Executive Headquarters, the Kaifeng Yellow River Committee, and the Henan Provincial Government, totaling more than 30 people. Regarding the blocking issue, engineers from all parties unanimously agreed that it should not be carried out before the major flood season, and that only protective work should be done on the completed dikes. Regarding the issues of labor, grain, funds, and relocation relief funds required for the downstream dike restoration project, all parties unanimously agreed that the Nanjing agreement should be strictly implemented, and that the meeting records of these two issues could be signed by both parties. General Zhou left Bian on the 21st and flew to Shanghai via Nanjing. Representatives from the Jilu Yu liberated area, Cheng Run, Wang Xiaoyi, Guan Datong, and others accompanied him, representing the people of the area in demanding that the Kuomintang authorities and the Executive Headquarters implement the Nanjing agreement and allocate public funds, grain, and relief funds in full.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th dispatch] Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch: Zhou Enlai, at 9:00 AM on the 22nd, continued discussions with Jiang Tingfu, Director of the Executive Headquarters, Lei Shi, Director of UNRRA, Vice Director Bai Si, and Wei Xiangge, Director of the Agricultural Department of UNRRA, on the Yellow River project and relief work in the CPC area. Regarding the Yellow River blocking project plan, the plan proposed by engineer Todd has been approved by Jiang and Zhou. Other issues are currently facing rising water levels and construction difficulties, so the blocking work must be continued after the flood recedes in mid-September. Regarding relief work, Jiang agreed to raise 1.5 billion in relief funds from August to November for four months for the CPC to use for relief, to be handled jointly by representatives of the Executive Headquarters. After the meeting, Jiang and Zhou continued to discuss the relief work in the CPC area, and Jiang agreed to intensify relief work in the CPC area and set up as many branch offices as possible. In addition, the CPC has appointed Wu Yunfu as its representative to the Executive Headquarters.

　　周恩来将军由汴飞沪
    继续商谈黄河问题
    【本报荷泽二十三日电】中共代表周恩来将军，为商谈黄河问题于十九日由沪飞汴，冀鲁豫解放区治黄代表王笑一、成润等偕行，当日视察花园口堵口工程，二十日在汴出席黄河问题座谈会，参加者计有冀鲁豫、渤海两解放区代表王化云、管大同、刘季青等，暨联总、行总、开封黄委会、河南省府等各方人员三十余人。关于堵口问题，各方工程师均一致认为在大汛前不应进行，目前仅应作已完成堤坝的防护工作。关于下游复堤工程所需工粮、工款及迁移救济费问题，各方一致认为应切实按照南京协议执行，该两项问题已有会谈记录双方即可签字。周将军于二十一日离汴飞沪返京，冀鲁豫解放区代表成润、王笑一、管大同等随行，代表该区人民要求国民党当局及行总，执行南京协议，如数拨发公款工粮及救济费。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】中央社沪讯：周恩来二十二日九时与行总署长蒋廷黻、联总署长雷氏、副署长拜斯及联总农业部主任威香格等，续商黄河工程及中共区救济工作。关于黄河堵口工程办法，工程师泰德所提办法，已由蒋周二氏赞同，其他问题现值水涨、兴工困难，故堵口工作须待九月中涨水退后方克继续进行。关于赈济工作，蒋氏允在八月至十一月四个月间，筹赈款十五亿交中共作救济之用，由行总代表共同处理。会后蒋周二氏续商中共区之救济工作问题，蒋氏允在中共区加紧推行救济工作，并尽可能多设分署。又中共已派伍云甫为驻行总代表。
