Xinhua News Agency, Lin Yi, 13th: Jiaodong Liberated Area fishermen have seen significant development after receiving loans of 6.6 million in local currency (20 yuan of legal tender per yuan) from the democratic government. Currently, the entire area, including migrant fishermen, has more than 37,000 people. This spring's catch was approximately 85 million catties, exceeding last year's total production by 27%. With an average fish price of 8 yuan per catty, the fishermen's income reached 680 million in local currency. Each fisherman's average income is over 18,000 in local currency, equivalent to 3,600 catties of grain. This is not only a great improvement compared to the enemy and puppet regime period but also exceeds the pre-war annual income of each fisherman. Before the war, the highest annual income per person was 2,000 catties of grain. To facilitate the sale of fish products, the democratic government, in addition to rewarding fish merchants to expand trade and increase exports, has also established fish ponds in major coastal ports, purchasing fresh fish in large quantities at high prices. This prevents fish prices from being driven down due to overproduction, allowing fishermen to sell their fish products promptly and receive cash.

　　胶东渔业显著发展
    三万余渔民获巨利
    【新华社临沂十三日电】胶东解放区渔民在获得民主政府六百六十万元本币（每元合法币二十元）贷款后，已有显著发展。现全区连同外来渔民，共三万七千余人，今春捕鱼约八千五百万斤，超过去年总产量百分之二十七。每斤鱼价以平均八元计，则渔民们收入本币六万万八千元，每一渔民平均可收入本币一万八千余元，折合粮食三千六百斤，不仅比敌伪统治时期大为改善，且超过战前每一渔民的全年收入。按战前每人全年最高收入为两千斤粮食。民主政府为畅销鱼产，除奖励渔商扩大贸易大量出口外，并在各主要海口，开设鱼池，大量高价收买鲜鱼，使鱼价不致因产量过多而压低，渔民可及时销售鱼产获得现款。
