Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 1st. Under the plunder and brutal taxation of the Pseudo-Yan army, the villages and towns around Fanshi are full of rubble, and weeds grow in the fields. The Pseudo-Yan army extorts in numerous ways, the most harsh being: (1) "Land Tax Collection": For every tael of land tax, 2.65 dan of wheat, 4 zhang of homespun cloth, and 7.5 jin of cotton are levied. (2) "Life-Saving Tax": Also known as kidnapping, this is carried out in villages farther from the city. In seven villages including Huayan, Fulianfang, and Liangzhuang, over two hundred people have been kidnapped, thousands of sheep and over two hundred livestock have been taken, and countless amounts of grain and money have been extorted. (3) "Food Rationing System": Every morning and noon, groups of three to five Pseudo-Yan soldiers set out to "ration food" in villages near the county town. Every village has been eaten bare, and the masses are fleeing in droves. A certain landlord named Hou Peiyao said: "My family has not eaten millet since the Ming Dynasty, and now we can't even get enough chaff to eat. Truly, if the Pseudo-Yan is not eliminated, how can the people be reborn!"
