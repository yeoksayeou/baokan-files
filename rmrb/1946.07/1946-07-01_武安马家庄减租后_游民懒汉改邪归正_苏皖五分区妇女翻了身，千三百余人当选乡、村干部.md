    After rent reduction in Majiazhuang, Wu'an, many bandits and loafers have turned into good people, and those who have been successfully reformed have been elected as deputy cadres by the masses. In the past, out of more than 400 households and 1,391 people in the village, there were 73 bandits. During the rent reduction movement, everyone looked for the "root of poverty." Those who were bandits also found the root of their banditry. For example, Ma Fang reflected: "In the old society, we were so oppressed by the landlords that we couldn't make a living, so we had to become bandits to survive. Today, the poor have turned over, so why should I do that unlucky thing again?" Ma Fang's awareness was quick, and he was recently elected as the director of the Armed Forces Committee by the masses. Now the bandits in the village are actively trying to learn to be good people. The mutual aid group led by Ma Fang alone has seven out of nine people who used to be bandits. They are very enthusiastic about production. The lazy man, Wen He, is also actively trying to get rich. After the bandits mended their ways, their families also became harmonious. For example, Ma Fang's wife used to want to divorce him because he was a bandit, but now they have become a loving couple.
    Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 24th. In the spring mass movement, 210,000 women in the Fifth Sub-district of Suwan (formerly the Yanfu District of Northern Jiangsu) were organized, and women's federation organizations have been popularized in all counties and cities in the district. The movement began during a period of severe famine. Counties and districts mobilized more than 500,000 disaster-stricken women to carry out production work such as boiling salt, scraping saltpeter, making cattail bags, cattail shoes, picking grass, cutting grass, and raising pigs. Then, on the basis of completing preliminary organization and discovering activists, women were widely mobilized to participate in struggles such as punishing traitors, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, and clearing debts. The number of participants accounted for more than 60% of the total number of participants in the struggle. Taking Funing as an example, 100,000 women participated in 178 struggles, supporting various liberation movements, and the status of women has been greatly improved. 309 women have been elected as members of township governments, and 1,374 women have been elected as village chiefs and village committee members.
