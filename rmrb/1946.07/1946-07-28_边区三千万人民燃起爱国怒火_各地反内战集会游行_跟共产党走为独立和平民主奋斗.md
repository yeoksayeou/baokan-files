　　From this newspaper's Handan dispatch on the 25th: In recent days, the flames of patriotic anti-civil war sentiment and opposition to American military aid to Chiang Kai-shek are burning fiercely among the 30 million people of the Border Region. In the northern Henan cities of Jiaozuo, Qinyang, Wuzhi, Bo'ai, Wenxian, and Xiuwu, large-scale anti-civil war mobilization rallies and patriotic demonstrations have been held successively. In Bo'ai County, over 1,700 primary and secondary school students, during the county-wide patriotic parade, clenched their fists and shouted, "We want independence, we want peace, we want democracy." At the current affairs symposium for all sectors of the county and a mass mobilization rally of over 7,000 people, the liberated masses resentfully reviewed their strength. Militiamen carried their polished guns, and the self-defense forces carried stretchers and pushed transport vehicles, determined to oppose the American imperialist elements' aid to Chiang in the civil war. They said with great sorrow: "We, the people who have been resurrected from the dead, can never forget the eight years of tragic life when we were abandoned by the Kuomintang army, enslaved by Japanese imperialism, and terrorized and slaughtered by traitorous secret agents and local bullies. Now that the Kuomintang reactionaries are attacking us, we have no choice but to fight them to the end." In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, the cities of Daokou, Heze, and Jining, as well as over twenty counties including Nanle, Weinan, Yanjin, Minquan, and Cao County, with a total of 12 million people, also gathered and paraded in an irrepressible rage. Jinan City even held a 50,000-person anti-civil war mobilization rally the other day. At the Daokou City anti-civil war rally, militia steel gun team leader Qiao said with fervor: "No matter if it's the Central Army or the Black Killing Corps, whoever comes to attack us, we will eliminate them one by one." A representative of the liberated peasants said: "We can no longer let the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialists stand on our heads and shit and piss on us. We must unite and resolutely defend our own interests." In the four major cities of southern Hebei, Hengshui, Linqing, Daming, and Weixian, 30,000-person anti-civil war rallies were also held separately, as well as current affairs symposiums for representatives of all classes. At the symposiums of Hengshui alcohol factory workers, barbers, and rural hired laborers, everyone said with great anger: "Chiang Kai-shek is relying on American imperialism to fight a civil war, wanting us to be their slaves again? This must not happen! We must resolutely follow the Communist Party, and we will always be free masters." At the merchants' symposium, everyone denounced Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous act of selling out national sovereignty and inland river navigation rights. Everyone was extremely angry when the topic of civil war was raised. In the end, they unanimously passed a resolution to actively support the self-defense front and resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's leading puppet troops to attack the southern Hebei liberated area. The masses in six counties including Ji County, Wuyi, and Zaoqiang also held rallies and shouted in unison: "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on the US to wage civil war," "We are not willing to be slaves of Japanese imperialism, and we cannot be slaves of American imperialism," and other passionate slogans. In the Taiyue Region, the entire population is suffering the joint attack of Chiang and Yan's armies. They have already been urgently mobilized and are singing sorrowful war songs, supporting the self-defense front day and night.
