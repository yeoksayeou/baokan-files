　　Yunnan Army's 184th Division Glorious Uprising
    Kunming Citizens Overjoyed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] Chongqing Air Dispatch: After the news of the Yunnan Army's 184th Division's uprising in Haicheng reached Kunming, the citizens were overjoyed and inspired. The uprising of the officers and soldiers of the 184th Division was the topic of every conversation. It was commonly said that if more troops forced to fight in the civil war could also raise the banner of revolt, it would be a powerful blow to the Kuomintang government's policy of military expansionism. Mr. Lin Dong, who once served in the division, wrote to the Xinhua Daily, stating: "Upon hearing the news of the uprising, I was extremely excited, my blood vessels almost burst." He listed the history of the 184th Division and its contributions to the War of Resistance Against Japan, saying: "The 184th Division, along with the 182nd and 183rd Divisions, originally belonged to the 60th Army. This army was an elite force from Yunnan, and the 184th Division was its backbone. The first battle they participated in during the War of Resistance was the Battle of Taierzhuang. The government intended to reorganize the division into the New Third Army and equip it as a mechanized unit, but because it was a local force, a secret order canceled its mechanization qualification, and it was reorganized again. However, it still persisted in the War of Resistance, and in 1939, it participated in the battles of Nanchang and Changsha. Afterwards, it fought in the Xiang and Gan regions, and later rushed back to Yunnan to defend western Yunnan and entered northern Vietnam. After the victory, it was forced by the reactionaries to go to the Northeast."

　　滇军一八四师光荣起义
    昆明市民欢欣异常
    【新华社延安二十八日电】重庆航讯：滇军一八四师起义海城消息传到昆明后，市民欢欣鼓舞。一八四师官兵起义，街谈巷议，莫不以此为题材。咸谓如有更多被迫打内战的军队同举义旗，当可给国民党政府之穷兵黩武政策以一当头棒喝。曾在该师任职之林洞先生投书新华日报，略称：闻悉起义消息兴奋的很，血管都几乎涨裂。他列述一八四师之历史，及抗日功迹说：一八四师原与一八二、一八三师全属六十军，该军为云南劲旅，而一八四师为中坚，参加抗日的第一仗，为台儿庄战役。政府以该师为主体，改编为新三军，拟配备成机械化部队，终因他是地方部队，又一纸密令取消机械化资格，再度整编。但他仍坚持抗日战争，二十八年曾参加南昌、长沙诸役。此后转战于湘、赣间，嗣后赶回云南保卫滇西，进入越北。胜利后被反动派迫赴东北。
