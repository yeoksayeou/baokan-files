Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 26th. Madame Soong Ching Ling, the director of the China Welfare Fund, concerned about the health construction in the Liberated Areas, raised funds from the International Red Cross for a hospital half a year ago and donated it to the Jiangsu-Anhui border region. The hospital was escorted by Dr. Yan Fude of the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and others, and arrived here on the 15th of this month. The hospital has 250 beds and all the necessary medical equipment and is named the Peace Hospital. When all the equipment arrived in Zhenjiang, it was unreasonably detained by the Kuomintang authorities for many days. Only after repeated negotiations by Madame Soong and others was it released.

Correction

In the report of the Luoning Uprising on page two of this newspaper on July 23, the "Commander Zhang Junzhen" should be "Commander Zhang Fuzhen."

Also, in the "Notice of the Education Department of the Border Region on Issuing Bonuses for Literary and Educational Works" on the 17th, the sentence "Magazines: including various magazines founded in various regions" at the beginning of the second paragraph (bonus grades, number of places) should be at the end of the first paragraph (types of works). We hereby make the correction and apologize for the error.

　　宋庆龄先生捐赠苏皖边区医院一所
    【新华社淮阴二十六日电】中国福利基金委员会主持人宋庆龄先生，关怀解放区卫生建设，于半年前向国际红十字会募集医院一所，捐赠苏皖边区，业于本月十五日由联总严敷德医师等人，押运抵达此间。该院有病床二百五十张及医药器材等全部设备，定名为和平医院。全部器材运抵镇江时，曾被国民党当局无理扣留多日，几经宋先生等辗转交涉，始得放行。
    更正
    本报七月二十三日二版洛宁起义消息中“张俊振师长”为“张复振师长”之误。
    又十七日“边将教育厅为颁发文教作品奖金通告”中，第二段（奖金等第、名额）首之“杂志：包括各地创办之各种杂志”一句，应在第一段（作品种类）文末。特此更正，并致歉意。
