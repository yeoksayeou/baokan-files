　　Resolving Difficulties in Combining Agriculture and Iron Industries
    Iron Furnaces Double in Huguan
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] In mid-June, Huguan summarized its iron industry production for the past two months. Statistics from the Fifth District alone show that the original 63 furnaces from the year before last have now grown to 174 this spring. Nine hundred and twenty-eight workers have been organized to resume work, with a total profit of over 1,519,000 yuan in four months. The main reasons for such rapid development are: First, the unhindered sales in the liberated areas have naturally led to a demand for furnaces among the masses. In addition, the "cultivate three, surplus one" plan has made it clear to the masses that to prosper, agriculture and the iron industry must be combined. Second, the organization of mass investment has overcome the financial difficulties with collective strength. The 14 newly added iron smelting furnaces in Caojiagou and Baichi Village were restored through mass fundraising and a government loan of 1.5 million yuan. Third, the difficulties in combining agriculture and iron industries have been appropriately resolved. The specific method is that mutual aid teams cultivate the land for the workers, and the agricultural wages are equivalent to the average wages of workers in the furnace. Another method is for workers to improve production efficiency and draw on surplus labor for agricultural production. Baichi Village originally produced a furnace of goods every four days, but during the busy farming season, this was changed to every six days. They were divided into two shifts, one shift to operate the furnace and the other to work the land, alternating with each other. In terms of labor-capital profit sharing, Baichi Village uses 1,800 jin of goods per furnace as the standard, with labor and capital sharing profits at a ratio of 40/60 (i.e., labor 40, capital 60). If more than 1,800 jin are produced, the profit sharing ratio is reversed to 60/40. This profit-sharing system has developed share capital and improved worker production efficiency. Significant achievements have also been made in training technical workers. Before the war, there were 350 skilled workers in the entire district, but only 77 remained after the war. This spring alone, 20 have been trained, providing considerable convenience for furnace restoration. It is estimated that more than 200 technical workers can be trained throughout the year.

　　解决农铁业结合困难
    壶关铁炉倍增
    【本报长治讯】壶关六月中旬总结近两月余的铁业生产，只以五区统计，前年原有炉六十三座，今春已发展成一百七十四座，组织了九百二十八个工人复工，四个月营利总额一百五十一万九千余元。能如此迅速发展，主要原因是：一、解放区的销路畅行无阻，群众便有了装炉的自然要求，加以订定耕三余一的计划，群众明确了要发家，就得农业和铁业结合。二、组织了群众投资，用大家力量克服资金困难。曹家沟和百尺村新增的十四座炼铁炉，是在群众自己集股复工和政府贷款一百五十万元下恢复起来的。三、适当解决了农铁业结合的困难。具体办法是互助组给工人种地，农业工资相当于炉上中等工人工资。其次是工人提高生产效率，抽剩余劳力做农业生产。百尺村原四天出一炉货，农忙时改为六天出一炉，共分两班，一班座炉，一班上地，互相替换。在劳资分红制上，百尺村是以每炉出一千八百斤货为标准，劳资作正四六分红（即劳四资六），如超出一千八百斤，作倒四六分红。这个分红制，发展了股金，又提高了工人生产效率。在培养技术工人上，也有显著成绩，战前全区有技工三百五十人，战后只留七十七人，仅今春即培养了二十个，给复炉以相当便利条件。预计今年全年可培养出二百余技术工人。
