　　Specially Come to Give Thanks
　　——Shanxi Folk Tale
　　Wu Qun
　　After Yan Xishan returned to Taiyuan city and colluded with the Japanese devils, the people of Taiyuan hated him. Posters with the words "Oppose Yan Xishan" were frequently put up on the streets. Yan was afraid. After suffering a major defeat against the Eighth Route Army in southeastern Shanxi, he became even more restless and uneasy. One night, just as he was about to fall asleep, he heard someone outside the door shout "Report!" Yan, in a daze, told them to come in. The door opened, and two people covered in blood walked in. They went to the edge of the bed and, without saying a word, knelt down and kowtowed vigorously. Yan thought: Everyone else says bad things about me, how come these two treat me so well? So he asked, "What do you two do?" The two stood up and said, "We were originally two big traitors from Taiyuan. Last May, we were killed by the Eighth Route Army's guerrilla group outside the East Gate. In the underworld, the King of Hell knew we were traitors and gave each of us a hundred strokes of the board, and then imprisoned us in the eighteenth level of hell. We thought we would never be able to get out, but who knew that you, old man, would return to Taiyuan and scrape the land so fiercely that you even scraped a big hole through the eighteenth level of hell, allowing us to be resurrected from the dead, so we" Specially come to give thanks!" When Yan Xishan heard that they were ghosts, he was shocked and shouted, "Drive away the ghosts!" But the two ghosts were not afraid at all, and they calmly laughed and said, "Don't fight, we are family!"
