Introducing Methods for Killing Mole Crickets
Currently, mole crickets are damaging crops in various areas. The following method for killing them is introduced: The best way to kill mole crickets is by digging trenches. First, in the fields where mole crickets are found, dig small trenches, one foot wide and five inches deep. Then, put some horse manure in the trenches to attract the mole crickets. Although mole crickets are active at night, they hide in the manure during the day. At this time, have someone pull a broken tin bucket or ring a brass bell along the trenches. When the mole crickets hear the sound, they will come out of the manure, and you can immediately kill them with the sole of your shoe.

　　介绍杀蝼蛄虫办法
    现各地已发生蝼蛄虫咬庄稼，特将杀法介绍于下：杀蝼蛄虫最好办法，是用挖沟法，先在发现蝼蛄虫的地里，挖成小沟，一尺宽，五寸深，然后再把沟里倒些马粪，引诱蝼蛄虫进去，蝼蛄虫虽夜出活动，但在白天就躲在粪里，这时，着人拿着破洋铁桶或铜铃顺小沟挨着向前拉，蝼蛄虫听见声音，就从粪里钻出，可马上用鞋底打死。
