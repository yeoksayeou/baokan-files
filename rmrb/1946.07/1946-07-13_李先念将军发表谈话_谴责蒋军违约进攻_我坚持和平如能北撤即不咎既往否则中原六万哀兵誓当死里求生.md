Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, July 7th (Delayed Dispatch) General Li Xiannian of the CPC Central Plains Military Region today issued a statement regarding the large-scale attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's troops, stating: The Kuomintang army's vicious "encirclement and annihilation" plan against our Central Plains Military Region troops has been plotted for over ten months. As early as the Chongqing negotiations in September of last year, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party reached an agreement on the northern withdrawal of our Central Plains troops. However, Chiang Kai-shek not only refused to fulfill his promise but also surrounded us with 300,000 troops, launching attacks step by step, determined to put our 60,000 meritorious anti-Japanese soldiers to death. After the ceasefire order took effect on January 10th this year, Chiang's troops still violated the agreement and captured Guangshan County on the morning of January 14th, and continued to attack in violation of the agreement. On January 21st, the Beiping Executive Headquarters, recognizing the severity of the situation, dispatched the Ninth Group to Hankou to stop the Central Plains war. On January 23rd, a special agreement was signed in Luoshan by Kuomintang representatives Song Ruihe and Chen Dingxun, our representative Wang Zhen, and U.S. representative Folder. Our side, seeking peace through forbearance, did not insist on the withdrawal of Chiang's troops from the areas they had captured between January 13th and 23rd but only agreed that both sides would maintain the positions as of January 23rd. However, Chiang's troops, becoming more aggressive, intensified their attacks against us, especially on the western side of the Pinghan Railway. Therefore, on March 28th, the Ninth Group went to Yingshan in northern Hubei to mediate and signed the Yingshan Agreement, ordering the attacking Kuomintang troops to withdraw north of Yingshan by April 1st. At the same time, the CPC representatives in Chongqing repeatedly proposed in the Three-Person Committee that our army's northern withdrawal had already been agreed upon and was necessary for the implementation of the troop reorganization plan, and specifically proposed that 40,000 armed troops be transferred to northern Jiangsu or northern China for reorganization, and 20,000 be demobilized locally. The Kuomintang side, having no reason to refuse this legitimate request, could only agree in principle but consistently refused to sign. Their purpose was clearly only one: to take the lives of all our soldiers. In April, the situation in the Central Plains became increasingly serious. From January 10th to April 30th, Chiang's troops launched over 1,170 attacks against us, occupying more than 1,072 of our villages and towns. The Tongbai Mountain area between Queshan, Xinyang, Tongbai, and Biyang west of the Pinghan Railway, and most of the Jianghan Military Region including Yingshan, Anlu, Jingshan, Tianmen, Hanchuan, Xiaogan, and Yingcheng, were all occupied. Attacks were also launched against us east of the Pinghan Railway, and the liberated areas were seriously reduced. Thus, Chiang Kai-shek decided to launch a large-scale "encirclement and annihilation" against us in early May with lightning speed. Fortunately, the CPC Central Committee received accurate intelligence in advance and publicly exposed it. Under the urging of Zhou Enlai and Marshall, Zhou Enlai, Xu Yongchang, and Baird flew from Nanjing to Wuhan on May 5th to stop it. Zhou Enlai, Baird, and Kuomintang representative Wang Tianming personally went to Xuanhuadian to mediate. On May 10th, an agreement was reached in Hankou, deciding that the commanders of both sides would stop all conflicts, cease all troop movements violating the ceasefire order, and stop all construction of fortifications. The Beiping Executive Headquarters also dispatched the 32nd Group to cooperate with the Ninth Group to strengthen the mediation of the military conflicts in the Central Plains, as a guarantee of the Hankou Agreement. However, the ink of the Hankou Agreement was not yet dry when the attacks by Chiang's troops continued from May 13th. The Kuomintang representative of the 32nd Group even refused to participate in the mediation and left the group without authorization. From May 13th to June 25th, Chiang's troops launched more than 120 attacks against us, slightly fewer than in April, but the intensity of the attacks was even greater. After June 10th, the Kuomintang army not only launched "suppression" campaigns against the Tongbai and Jianghan liberated areas west of the railway with tens of thousands of troops but also launched fierce attacks against our eastern Hubei liberated area, occupying forty to fifty of our villages and towns in just over twenty days, trapping our troops in a small area. At this time, Chiang Kai-shek believed that the final opportunity had arrived and ordered the implementation of his vicious plan of "encircling and annihilating in one fell swoop" on June 26th. At dawn on June 26th, 100,000 of Chiang's troops suddenly launched multi-pronged attacks against the Xuanhuadian area, the location of the Central Plains Military Region headquarters. Our troops, having endured beyond the limit, rose up to meet the attack, but due to the disparity in strength, Xuanhuadian eventually fell. For the sake of survival, our troops had no choice but to break through in separate directions. Most of our troops have now been transferred to the area west of the Pinghan Railway on the Hubei-Henan border, some are still in the original location, and another part has gone to the Hubei-Henan-Anhui border area. Although Chiang Kai-shek's original vicious plan of "encirclement and annihilation" has failed, he is gathering a large army to "attack," "block," and "suppress" our troops separately, and the air force is also dispatched to assist in the battle. The war is exceptionally tense and cruel. It is laughable that Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman, unable to defend the Chiang side's blatant violation of the January 10th ceasefire order and the Luoshan, Yingshan, and Hankou agreements, and unable to conceal their vicious "encirclement and annihilation" plan, actually falsely accused our side of attacking. The world knows that Chiang's forces are five or six times larger than ours, that our side is in a state of being surrounded and blockaded by Chiang's side, and that our liberated areas have been shrinking month by month and being occupied day by day in the six months since January 10th. Now, even our headquarters, Xuanhuadian, has been captured, and the liberated area with a population of 15 million has now been almost completely occupied. Then, who is keeping the agreement and seeking peace, and who is violating the agreement and attacking? Isn't this perfectly clear? Is there any room for cunning and deception? Although our troops are now breaking through to survive, our side's adherence to a peaceful stance will not waver in the slightest. I now solemnly declare on behalf of the 60,000 officers and soldiers of our Central Plains troops: As long as Chiang Kai-shek implements the agreement of September last year, allows our troops to peacefully withdraw to the North China liberated area, and protects all the democratic rights of the people in the Central Plains liberated area, then our side can still forgive Chiang Kai-shek's towering crimes of such bad faith and inhumanity and not hold past actions against him. Otherwise, our 60,000 exhausted soldiers will spare no effort and vow to fight for survival. We believe that the military and civilians in our national liberated areas are as close as flesh and blood and will certainly not let this matter rest. Chiang Kai-shek himself will bear full responsibility for all serious developments.

　　李先念将军发表谈话
　  谴责蒋军违约进攻
    我坚持和平如能北撤即不咎既往否则中原六万哀兵誓当死里求生
    【新华社中原某地七日电】（迟到）中共中原军区李先念将军今日为蒋军大举进攻事发表谈话称：国民党军对我中原军区部队穷凶极恶的“围歼”计划，蓄谋已在十个月以上。早在去年九月重庆谈判中，国共双方对我中原部队北撤事，即有协议，但蒋介石不但拒绝执行诺言，反以三十万大军重重包围，步步进攻，必置我六万抗日有功的将士于死地。今年一月十日停战令生效后，蒋军仍于十四日上午攻占我光山县城，嗣后不断违约进攻。一月二十一日，北平执行部鉴于形势严重，特派第九小组前往汉口负责制止中原战事，并于一月二十三日由国民党代表宋瑞河、陈鼎勋，我方代表王震及美方代表福尔德在罗山签订专门协议，我方忍让求全，对蒋军于一月十三日至二十三日攻占的地区，并未坚持要其撤退，仅约定双方维持一月二十三日位置。但蒋军得寸进尺，对我进攻变本加厉，在平汉路西方面进攻尤烈。故三月二十八日第九小组特往鄂北的应山调处，并签订应山协议，限令国民党进攻军队于四月一日前撤回应山以北。同时，重庆中共代表以我军北撤已经成议，为执行整军方案，亦非北撤不可，再三于三人委员会中提出，要求立付实现，并具体提议以四万武装部队转移苏北或华北就是整编，二万人就地复员。国民党方面对此正当要求，毫无任何理由可以拒绝，在原则上只好同意，但始终拒绝签字。其目的显然仅仅有一个，就是要我全军将士的命。四月间，中原形势益趋严重，自一月十日至四月三十日，蒋军向我进攻已逾一一七○次，占我村镇达一○七二处之多。我平汉路西确山、信阳、桐柏、泌阳间的桐柏山地区，与应山、安陆、京山、天门、汉川、孝感、应城江汉军区大部均被侵占。平汉路东亦向我进攻，解放区亦受严重缩小。于是蒋介石乃决心于五月初旬以迅雷不及掩耳的手段，大举向我“围歼”，幸经中共中央事前接获确实情报，予以公开揭发，在周恩来、马歇尔两氏督促下，卒由周恩来、徐永昌、白鲁德三氏于五月五日自南京飞汉制止，周恩来、白鲁德与国民党代表王天鸣三氏亲至宣化店调处，于五月十日在汉口成立协议，决定双方指挥官制止一切冲突，停止一切违反停战命令的部队调动和一切碉堡工事的建筑。北平执行部亦于同时增派第卅二小组协同第九小组加强调解中原的军事冲突，以为汉口协议的保证。但是，汉口协议墨迹未干，蒋军的进攻又于五月十三日起继续发生，而卅二小组的国民党代表，竟然拒绝参加调处，擅自脱离小组行动。自五月十三日至六月廿五日，蒋军向我进攻共一百二十余次，次数较四月间略少，但进攻的猛烈程度，则有过之。国民党军在六月十日以后，除各以数万的兵力对路西桐柏、江汉两解放区施行“清剿”外，并向我鄂东解放区猛烈进攻，于廿余日中，占我村镇四五十处，围困我军于狭小地带。这时蒋介石认为最后时机已至，乃下令六月廿六日实行其“一举包围歼灭”的毒计。六月二十六日拂晓，蒋军十万人突分路向我中原军区司令部所在地宣化店地区进攻，我军忍无可忍，奋起迎战，但以众寡悬殊，宣化店卒告失守。我军为生存计，不得不分路突围，现我军大部均已转移至平汉路以西鄂边豫界地区，一部仍在原地，另一部则至鄂豫皖边地带。蒋介石的原定“围歼”毒计虽告失败，但在聚集大军向我军分别“进击”、“堵击”与“清剿”，空军亦出动助战，战事异常紧张残酷。可笑的是蒋介石发言人无法辩护蒋方之悍然破坏一月十日停战令与罗山、应山、汉口、历次协议，亦无法隐瞒彼方之“围歼”毒计，竟反诬称我方进攻。世人皆知，蒋方兵力五六倍于我方，我方处于被蒋方包围封锁状态，且我解放区在一月十日以来六个月中，月月缩小，日日被占，到现在连我司令部所在地宣化店都被攻占了，一千五百万人口的解放区，现在被占殆尽了，那么究竟谁要守约和平，谁在违约进攻，这还不十分明白吗？这还有丝毫狡赖诈骗的余地吗？我军现虽突围求生，但我方坚持和平立场，决不稍有动摇，我现在代表我中原部队六万官兵郑重声明：只要蒋介石实行去年九月间的协议，允许我军和平撤往华北解放区，并保护中原解放区人民一切民主权利，则我方对于蒋介石如此背信弃义、灭绝人道的滔天罪行，仍可曲予原宥，不咎既往，否则我六万哀兵不惜一切，誓当死里求生，并信我全国解放区军民情同骨肉，亦决难就此干休，其一切严重发展，惟有由蒋介石本人负其全责。
