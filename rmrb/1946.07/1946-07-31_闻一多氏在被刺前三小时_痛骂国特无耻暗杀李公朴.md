Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th: Mr. Wen Yiduo, three hours before his assassination on the 15th, delivered a speech at a memorial meeting for Martyr Li Gongpu in Kunming, stating: "In these past few days, as everyone knows, the most despicable and shameless thing in history has occurred in Kunming. What crime did Mr. Li Gongpu commit to deserve such a deadly attack? He merely used his pen and mouth to write and say what was in the hearts of millions of people. Everyone has pens and mouths, and reasons to speak! Why resort to beatings and killings? And secretly killing.” (Applause) Mr. Wen asked indignantly, "Are there any secret agents here today? Please stand up and explain, on what basis was Mr. Li killed?" (Loud applause) After assassinating someone, they still slander them, talking about "affairs of the heart," saying that the Communist Party killed a Communist Party member, shameless! Shameless!!" (Enthusiastic applause) Mr. Wen continued, "This is the shamelessness of a certain group, it is Mr. Li's glory. Mr. Li's assassination in Kunming is Mr. Li's glory, and also the glory of the people of Kunming. Last year, on 'December 1st', the young students of Kunming were massacred for opposing the civil war. Now, Mr. Li has been assassinated by the reactionaries for fighting for democracy and peace. This is Kunming's infinite glory." (Loud applause) Mr. Wen pointed out: After the news of the reactionary assassination of Mr. Li spread, everyone shook their heads, not knowing what these shameless things were thinking, how their hearts were made. In fact, it's very simple, their madness and rampant behavior is precisely because they are panicking! Mr. Wen shouted, "Secret agents, think about it, you only have a few more days of assassinations. The people will surely be victorious. The reactionaries' shamelessness is Mr. Li's glory, and the reactionaries' doomsday is our dawn." Mr. Wen continued, "The people's patience is limited. Mr. Li has paid with his life, and we must exchange it for a price. The blood of the 'December 1st' warriors exchanged for the convening of the Political Consultative Conference. Mr. Li has fallen, and we must also exchange it for the convening of a Political Consultative Conference." (Loud applause) "We have this confidence." (Applause) Mr. Wen said, "Yunnan's glorious history, from the distant National Protection War to the recent 'December 1st', these all belong to the people of Yunnan, and we must carry them forward. The reactionaries are sowing discord, despicable and shameless. They think that the Southwest Associated University has left, the students are on summer vacation, and we are without people. Secret agents: look at the more than one thousand young people who have come today and joined hands again. We Kunming youth will never let you run rampant like this!" Mr. Wen pointed out: "History has entrusted Kunming with the task of democracy and peace, and the youth of Kunming must complete this task. We must be prepared to step out of the door like Mr. Li, and not be prepared to step back in." (Long and enthusiastic applause) "The blood of the warriors will not be shed in vain. Reactionaries: when you see one fall, you can immediately see thousands, ten thousands, countless successors." (Prolonged applause)

　　闻一多氏在被刺前三小时
    痛骂国特无耻暗杀李公朴
    【新华社南京二十八日电】闻一多氏十五日被刺前三小时，曾在昆明一追悼李公朴烈士大会上发表讲演称：“这几天大家晓得，在昆明出现了历史上最卑劣最无耻的事情，李公朴先生究竟犯了什么罪而遭此毒手？他只不过用笔用嘴写出了说出了千万人民心坎里的话，大家有笔有嘴，有理由讲呵！为什么要打要杀？而且偷偷摸摸的杀”。（鼓掌）闻氏愤激的发问：“今天这里有没有特务，请他站出来讲一讲，凭什么要杀死李先生”？（大鼓掌）暗杀了人，还要诬蔑人，说什么“桃色案件”，说什么共产党杀共产党，无耻呵！无耻啊！！”（热烈的鼓掌）闻氏紧接着说：“这是某集团的无耻，是李先生的光荣，李先生在昆明被暗杀是李先生的光荣，也是昆明人的光荣。去年“一二、一”，昆明青年学生为了反对内战遭受屠杀，现在李先生为了争取民主和平而遭遇反动派的暗杀，这是昆明无限的光荣”。（大鼓掌）闻氏指出：反动派暗杀李先生的消息传出后，大家听了都摇头，不知道这些无耻的东西怎样想法，他们的心是怎样长的。其实也很简单，他们这样疯狂猖獗，正是他们着慌呵！闻氏高呼：“特务们，你们想想，你们还有几天的暗杀，人民是一定要胜利的。反动派的无耻，就是李先生的光荣，反动派的末日，就是我们的光明”。闻氏继称：“人民的忍耐是有限度的，李先生赔上了一条性命，我们要换来一个代价，“一二、一”战士们的血换来了政治协商会议的召开，李先生倒下了，也要换来一个政协会议的召开，（大鼓掌）我们有这个信心”。（鼓掌）闻氏说：“云南光荣的历史，远的如护国，近的如“一二、一”，这些都是属于云南人民的，我们要发扬。反动派挑拨离间，卑鄙无耻，他们以为联大走了，学生放暑假了，我们就没有人了，特务们：你们看看今天到会的一千多青年又握起手来了，我们昆明青年绝不让你们这样横行下去”！闻氏指出：“历史赋予昆明的任务是民主和平，我们昆明的青年必须完成这一任务，我们要准备和李先生一样前脚踏出大门，后脚就不准备踏进大门。（长时的热烈鼓掌）战士们的血是不会白流的，反动派：你们见一个倒下了，马上可以看见千个万个无数个继起者”。（掌声持久不息）
