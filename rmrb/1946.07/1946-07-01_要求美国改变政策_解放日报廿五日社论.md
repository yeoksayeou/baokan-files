Demanding that the United States Change its Policy
    *Liberation Daily* Editorial, July 25th

The recent questionable China policy of the U.S. government authorities has greatly hurt the patriotic feelings of the Chinese people, who hope for the normal development of Sino-American friendship. The recent bill requested by the U.S. State Department, Navy Department, and War Department to Congress to continue military aid to Chiang Kai-shek has particularly aroused the strong astonishment of every Chinese person with national self-respect. Comrade Mao Zedong's statement and the large demonstration of 50,000 people in Shanghai are correct expressions of the will of the entire Chinese people. The Chinese people cannot but raise two questions to these authorities in the U.S. government: First, why must the U.S. government force war upon China and not allow the Chinese people to enjoy internal and external peace? Second, why must the U.S. government force China to become a sphere of influence and protectorate of the U.S., and not allow the Chinese people to develop equal friendship with the American people?

Since the Japanese surrender, the U.S. authorities have developed an ambiguous relationship with the Chiang Kai-shek government in China. The essence of this relationship is that China sells its territorial sovereignty, allowing U.S. Army and Marine Corps to freely station and operate on Chinese territory, allowing U.S. warships to freely station and operate in Chinese territorial waters, allowing U.S. Air Force to freely fly in Chinese airspace, allowing U.S. merchant ships to freely travel in Chinese inland rivers, allowing U.S. munitions to control Chinese officers, allowing U.S. military advisors to control Chinese military training and administration, and allowing U.S. goods and capital to monopolize the Chinese market and eliminate all Chinese national production; allowing the U.S., under the guise of the so-called Open Door Policy, to make China bear the sum total of all past unequal treaties with the U.S., turning China into America's Philippines, America's Latin America; allowing American imperialist elements to manipulate China's internal affairs and diplomacy, making China a puppet for these imperialist elements in their armed anti-Soviet and anti-Communist activities. ... And the price? The price is that these elements in the U.S. use all their military, financial, and diplomatic power to support the Chiang Kai-shek government in China, which implements a policy of dictatorship and civil war. Although this government is not only required by the vast majority of the Chinese people to reorganize itself, but even the governments of the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union, and even this government itself, cannot but admit that it must be reorganized. This policy of the U.S. government reminds one of the Japanese imperialists' policy toward the traitor and quisling Wang Jingwei (Japanese imperialism also once declared to Wang Jingwei that it would "abolish unequal treaties"). There is no doubt that this policy is clearly one that undermines Sino-American friendship, violates the will of the entire Chinese people, and violates the will of the vast majority of the American people.

The Chinese people highly value American friendship. American friendship and assistance not only made a significant contribution to China's war against Japan, but also have a significant place in China's post-war peaceful construction. When U.S. President Truman declared his support for China's peace and democracy and non-interference in China's internal affairs, and the U.S. Secretary of State signed the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference Communiqué, declaring that China should end its dictatorship and civil war, and stating that U.S. troops and Soviet troops would withdraw from China in the shortest possible time, the Chinese people expressed great welcome and trust in U.S. policy. However, events in recent months have shown that the U.S. government's policy is not consistent with the above promises. They are actually doing their best to expand the civil war in China, strengthen China's dictatorship, interfere in China's internal affairs, and infringe on China's territorial sovereignty. The Chinese people will never tolerate re-accepting another imperialist aggression after a hundred years of struggle against unequal treaties, especially the bloody struggle of eight years against Japanese aggression, re-accepting another set of unequal treaties (whether tangible or intangible, public or secret), and continuing to accept dictatorial rule, continue to kill each other in civil war, or become victims of some international war under the demands of this imperialist policy. Of course, there are some people in China, such as the Chiang Kai-shek Group, who are willing to do so, but they can never represent the will of the Chinese nation. During the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, the whole world knew that they were passive. Before the War of Resistance, they practiced a policy of non-resistance; after the War of Resistance, they called for the restoration of peace with Japan to the state before the July 7th Incident. Their huge army surrendered to the enemy and became puppet troops, and they are still colluding with these puppet troops. They do not know what the interests of the country and the nation are, except for the interests of their dictatorship -- the attempt by some authorities in the U.S. to replace the consent of the Chinese people with their consent is just a self-deceiving trick, just as Japanese imperialism once replaced the consent of the Chinese people with the consent of the Wang Jingwei Group.

Under these circumstances, it is entirely understandable that the entire Chinese people have risen up unanimously to resolutely oppose the U.S. government's so-called military aid to China and resolutely demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. It would be inconceivable if the Chinese people did not do so. China demands peace and construction. Why doesn't the U.S. help China's peace and democracy, but instead helps China's dictatorship and civil war? Why doesn't the U.S. give China production machines and engineers, but instead gives China guns, tanks, bombers, warships, and military advisors? When the U.S. military was resisting Japan in China, it did not land in China and did not actively assist all anti-Japanese forces in China. Why, after the Japanese surrender and after the outbreak of the Chinese civil war, did it land everywhere in China, stay for a long time, and desperately equip and train the Kuomintang reactionary army? Under these circumstances, what right does the U.S. government have to demand that the Chinese people believe that they are fair, neutral, and well-intentioned, and to give them the final decision-making power or "arbitration power" or "adjudication power," etc., regarding China's internal disputes? The Chinese people love international peace as much as they love domestic peace, and they are neither anti-Soviet nor anti-American. However, this imperialist policy of the U.S. authorities, which is a policy that seriously harms Sino-American friendship, should bear full responsibility for the outbreak of the Chinese people's legitimate patriotic sentiments today. In order to consolidate Sino-American friendship, it is necessary to clarify Sino-American relations, to stop and correct all measures that support China's dictatorial civil war, infringe on China's territorial sovereignty, undermine China's peace and democracy, and endanger China's independence and security, to stop and withdraw all so-called military aid to China, and to withdraw all troops stationed in China.

　　要求美国改变政策
    解放日报廿五日社论
    美国政府当局最近的可疑的对华政策，大大伤害了希望中美友谊正常发展的中国人民的爱国心。在美国国务院、海军部与陆军部最近要求国会通过的继续军事援蒋的法案、特别引起每个有民族自尊心的中国人的强烈惊异。毛泽东同志的声明和上海五万群众的大示威，便是全中国人民意志的正确表示。中国人民不能不向美国政府的这些当局提出两个问题：第一、美国政府为什么一定要强迫中国战争，不许中国人民享受对内与对外的和平？第二、美国政府为什么一定要强迫中国变为美国的势力范围与保护国，不许中国人民与美国人民发展平等的的友谊？
    自从日本投降以来，美国当局就与中国的蒋介石政府发展一种暧昧的关系，这种关系的要点就是中国出卖自己的领土主权，让美国的陆军和海军陆战队在中国的领土上自由驻扎行动，让美国的军舰在中国的领海上自由驻扎行动，让美国的空军在中国的领空上自由飞行，让美国的商船在中国的内河自由行驶，让美国的军火操纵中国的军官，让美国的军事顾问操纵中国的军事训练与行政，让美国的商品和资本垄断中国的市场，消灭中国的一切民族生产；让美国在所谓门户开放的口号下，使中国对美国担负过去一切不平等条约的总和，变中国为美国的菲律宾，美国的拉丁美洲；让美国的帝国主义分子操纵中国的内政与外交，使中国成为这些帝国主义分子武装反苏，武装反共的傀儡。……而代价呢？代价就是美国这些分子，用一切军事力量，财政力量，外交力量，支持中国实行独裁与内战政策的蒋介石政府。虽然这个政府不但绝大多数中国人民要求其改组，而且美英苏三国政府乃至这个政府自身，都不能不承认其必须改组。美国政府的这种政策，使人联想到日本帝国主义对付汉奸卖国贼汪精卫的政策（日本帝国主义也曾经向汪精卫宣布过“废除不平等条约”）。毫无疑问，这个政策是显然破坏中美友谊的政策，是违反全体中国人民意志与绝大多数美国人民意志的政策。
    中国人民是极其珍贵美国友谊的，美国的友谊援助不仅在中国对日战争中有其重大贡献，而且在中国战后的和平建设中也有其重大地位。当美国杜鲁门总统声明支持中国的和平民主，不干涉中国的内政，美国外长签字于莫斯科三国外长会议公告，声明要求中国结束独裁内战，并声明美军与苏军同样于最短期内撤离中国的时候，中国人民对于美国政策曾经表示很大的欢迎和信任。但是，几个月来的事变，表明美国政府的政策与上述诺言不相符合，他们实际上是在竭力扩大中国的内战，加强中国的独裁，干涉中国的内政，侵犯中国的领土主权。中国人民决不能忍受在一百年反不平等条约斗争，特别是八年反对日本侵略的流血斗争以后，重新接受另一个帝国主义的侵略，重新接受另一套不平等条约（无论是有形的或无形的，公开的或秘密的），并在这种帝国主义政策的要求之下，继续接受独裁统治，继续自相残杀的内战，或作某种国际战争的牺牲品。当然，中国也有些人，例如蒋介石集团是愿意如此的，但是他们从来不能代表中国民族的意志。在八年抗日战争中，全世界都知道，他们是消极的。在抗战前，他们曾经实行不抵抗主义；在抗战后，他们曾呼吁恢复七七事变以前状态的对日和平。他们的庞大军队投降敌人成为伪军，至今还在和这些伪军勾结，他们除了独裁的利益以外，根本不知道国家民族利益为何物—美国某些当局企图以他们的同意来代替中国人民的同意，正如日本帝国主义曾经以汪精卫集团的同意来代替中国人民的同意一样，不过是一种自欺欺人的骗术吧了。
    在这种情况之下，全中国人民一致奋起坚决反对美国政府的所谓军事援华，坚决要求美军撤退中国，是完全可以了解的。如果中国人不这样作，那才是不可思议的了。中国要求和平，要求建设，美国为什么不帮助中国的和平民主，而帮助中国的独裁内战呢？美国为什么不给中国生产的机器和工程师，而给中国枪炮坦克轰炸机军舰和军事顾问呢？美国军队在中国抗日的时候，不在中国登陆，不积极的援助全中国的一切抗日力量，为什么在日本投降以后，和中国内战爆发以后，反而在中国到处登陆，长驻不退，拚命装备和训练国民党反动派的军队呢？在这种情况之下，美国政府还有什么权利要求中国人民相信他们是公正的、中立的、善意的，并给予他们以关于中国内争的最后决定权或“仲裁权”或“公断权”等等呢？中国人民爱好国际和平，如同爱好国内和平一样，既不反苏，也不反美，但是美国当局这种帝国主义政策，即是严重危害中美友谊的政策，应该对中国人民今天的正当爱国情绪的爆发负全部责任。为了巩固中美友谊，就必须澄清中美关系，就必须停止和纠正一切支持中国独裁内战、侵害中国领土主权、破坏中国和平民主、危害中国独立安全的措施，就必须停止和收回一切所谓对华军事援助，并撤退一切驻华军队。
