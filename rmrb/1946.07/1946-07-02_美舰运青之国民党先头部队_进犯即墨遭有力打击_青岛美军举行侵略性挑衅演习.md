Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 29th: The Kuomintang 54th Army, transported by U.S. warships and landed in Qingdao, then launched an attack on Jimo. Its vanguard has been met with a powerful blow. One battalion of the 198th Division of the army, venturing out from Chengyang Station, invaded Yanjialing, 20 li west of Jimo City, on the 25th. That night, they were completely annihilated in our resolute resistance. Another battalion that infiltrated Xichenghui and other places more than 10 li south of Jimo City was also routed. On the same day, the army, in conjunction with the puppet troops of Zhang Qilu, and aided by two aircraft, attacked Wuqi Mountain and other places on the outskirts of Jimo City, but were also defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, Laiyang, 25th: The Kuomintang 54th Army, 36th Division and 198th Division, which arrived in Qingdao by U.S. warships on the 18th, landed and immediately advanced to Chengyang. From the Cikou and Chengyang line, they launched an attack on Jimo City, which we had newly liberated from the puppet troops. By the 23rd, they had occupied Bushang, Liujiaying, Yu Huangmiao Mountain and other places more than 20 li south of Jimo City. On the 24th, they launched attacks from the south, southeast, and southwest simultaneously. Our troops were forced to defend themselves, and fierce battles broke out with the invading army along the line of Dongxiguozhuang, Zhoucun, Damiao Mountain, Zhongcun, and the northeast mountains.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: While the Kuomintang authorities are expanding the civil war in Shandong, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao, in addition to transporting Kuomintang troops to Shandong, also held provocative military exercises in Qingdao on the 25th, infringing upon Chinese sovereignty. United Press, Peiping, 28th, reported: "The U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao is currently conducting combat exercises." A Central News Agency dispatch from Qingdao on the 26th reported: "The U.S. military stationed in Qingdao conducted a fortress assault exercise at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. General Clement, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, invited Ding Zhipan, the garrison commander, and the captains of his departments to visit and explained the fortress assault plan. The exercise lasted for 40 minutes." It is reported that the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Qingdao had continuously held live ammunition exercises from the 18th to the 23rd. Clement also openly declared at a press conference on the 18th: "The Qingdao urban area up to the Cangku (15 kilometers from Qingdao city) airport all have U.S. military institutions, and we will naturally take various measures to assist the authorities in maintaining law and order, in order to safeguard the safety of the U.S. military." The so-called "assisting the authorities in maintaining law and order" and "safeguarding the safety of the U.S. military" are all excuses for the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs with armed force.

    美舰运青之国民党先头部队
    进犯即墨遭有力打击
    青岛美军举行侵略性挑衅演习
    【新华社莱阳廿九日电】由美舰运抵青岛登陆后即向即墨进攻之国民党五十四军，其先头部队已遭有力打击，该军一九八师一个营，自城阳车站出犯，于廿五日侵入即墨城西廿里之阎家岭，当晚在我坚决抗击中，全部被歼。窜犯即墨城南十余里西城会等地之另一营，亦被击溃。同日该军结合伪军张其陆部，在两架飞机助战下，进扑即墨城郊之舞旗山等地，亦都击溃。
    【新华社莱阳二十五日电】十八日由美舰运抵青岛之国民党五十四军三十六师、一九八师登陆后，即开赴城阳。自磁口、城阳一线，向我新自伪军手中解放之即墨城进攻。至二十三日已侵占即墨城南二十余里之埠上、刘家营、玉皇庙山等地。二十四日复由南、东南、西南三面同时进攻，我军被迫自卫，在沿东西郭庄、周村、大庙山、仲村、东北山地一线，与进犯军展开激战。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】在国民党当局扩大山东内战之际，驻青岛美海军陆战队除运输国民党军到山东外，并于二十五日在青举行侵犯中国主权的挑衅性的军事演习。合众社北平二十八日电称：“青岛美海军陆战队现正进行作战演习”。中央社青岛二十六日电报导：“驻青美军昨午十一时实施堡垒攻击演习，美陆战队司令克莱门将军邀警备司令丁治盘及部各队长前往参观，并说明堡垒攻击计划，演习四十分钟”，按驻青美海军陆战队自十八日至二十三日，曾已连续举行实弹演习。克莱门并于十八日在记者招待会上公开宣称：“青市区迄沧口（距青市十五公里）飞机场，均有美军机构，自当采取各种方式协助当局维持治安，借以维护美军安全”。所谓“协助当局维持治安”及“维护美军安全”，皆系美国武装干涉中国内政之借口。
