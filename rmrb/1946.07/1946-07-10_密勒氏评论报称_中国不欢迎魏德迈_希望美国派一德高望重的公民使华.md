　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Foreign news agencies report that Wedemeyer, who fully supported the Nationalist government in expanding the Chinese civil war, will soon leave the United States for China to resume his former position as Commander of the U.S. forces in China.
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th: The Shanghai Miller's Review recently published a commentary entitled "Will Wedemeyer Be the Ambassador?" which stated: "We believe that General Wedemeyer is too closely related to the cruelty of war and the various complex problems after the Japanese surrender; he is still too closely related to equipping and transporting Nationalist troops, and the Nationalist Party's use of these troops to carry out civil war. We can imagine that he is not at all welcome by the Communist Party today, although he is merely implementing his country's policy." It continued: "We suggest that when President Truman designates a new envoy to China, he should not send those career army officers, or those tested and true Democratic Party hacks, especially from Missouri (referring to Truman's home state). We suggest that he choose someone from the diplomatic corps who is trained, capable, and reputable to be our ambassador. If this is not possible, then we hope he will appoint a respected ordinary citizen."

　　密勒氏评论报称
    中国不欢迎魏德迈
    希望美国派一德高望重的公民使华
    【新华社延安三日电】据外国通讯社报导：曾以全力支持国民党政府扩大中国内战的魏德迈，将于日内离美来华，恢复前驻华美军统帅职务。
    【新华社延安六日电】上海密勒氏评论报顷发表题为《是否魏德迈将做大使》之评论称：“我们相信魏德迈将军与战争的惨酷以及日本投降之后的种种错综复杂问题的关系，实在是太密切了；他现在依然与装配运输国民党军队，及国民党之利用这些军队来进行内战的关系，也是太密切了。我们可以想像，今天他在共产党方面是一点也不受欢迎的，虽然他仅仅是执行其国家政策的人”。继称：“我们建议杜鲁门总统在指定新使节到中国来时，最好不要派遣那些职业的陆军军官，或那些经过考验的以及真正的民主党的党棍，特别是米苏里州（按即杜鲁门的家乡）的。我们建议他从外交人员中选择那有训练的、有能力和有威信的人来做我们的大使。如果这样不可能的话，我们则希望他指定一个德高望重的普通公民”。
