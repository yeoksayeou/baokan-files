Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: Chiang Kai-shek has brazenly suspended the peace talks in Nanjing and suddenly went to Guling on the 14th of this month for sightseeing. As he stood on Mount Lu, looking out, the flames of a nationwide civil war, orchestrated by his own hand, were spreading rapidly.

    Central Plains Front: Li Xiannian's 60,000-strong army of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui soldiers broke through the encirclement of 300,000 Chiang troops. After Chiang Kai-shek's first "annihilation" plan failed on June 29th, he issued another handwritten order on the 7th of this month, instructing the infantry to pursue and block, and the air force to coordinate bombing, determined to "completely annihilate" our Central Plains troops. West of the Pinghan Railway, the Chiang army's pursuing troops were divided into three routes: the 41st and 47th Corps pursued towards Neixiang and Xichuan, the 10th and 15th Corps advanced aggressively towards Guanghua and Laohekou, and the 16th and 75th Corps advanced to the Hanshui line of Xiangyang and Yicheng. Meanwhile, Hu Zongnan's 90th Corps 61st Division and 9th Corps 206th Division of Shaanxi had arrived at Jingziguan and Wuguan along the northern Shaanxi border, and were continuing to advance eastward, attempting to cooperate with the pursuing troops to implement a pincer attack from the east and west. When Li Xiannian's troops were crossing the rapid and wide Hanshui River, Chiang's planes fiercely bombed the ferry crossings on both banks, attempting to annihilate the Central Plains troops on the banks of the Hanshui River, but this conspiracy did not succeed. Another part of Li Xiannian's troops, breaking through to the east, are engaged in fierce fighting with Chiang's 72nd Corps in Huang'an and Macheng. Because Chiang Kai-shek was eager to "annihilate," he ordered his troops to pursue day and night without rest, and soldiers were often whipped, causing much weariness and dissatisfaction among middle and lower-ranking officers and soldiers. Chiang's failure to "annihilate" led him to vent his anger on his troops for their poor performance, and several army and division commanders were punished, further increasing resentment in the army. Recently, more than 30 people from the 13th Division of the 72nd Corps refused to participate in the civil war.

    Suwan Front: Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale offensive against the Suwan Liberated Area began on the 15th on a 400-li front from Lai'an to Nantong on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Chiang's troops already dispatched include the 5th, 87th, and 4th Corps, as well as the 25th Corps in Lai'an, the 100th Corps in Taizhou, the 49th Corps in Nantong, and the 21st Corps in Chongming, launching fierce attacks with the aim of seizing Tiangchang, Gaoyou, Rugao, and other places. They have already occupied more than ten villages and towns, including Shuikou Town, Leiguan Canal, and Xinhuanggang, in Lai'an and Liuhe. In Nantong, Jingjiang, Taizhou, and Taixing, they have seized several important military locations, such as Lin×, Dingyan, Huangqiao, and Yaojiadai, and are currently fiercely attacking Rugao County. The fighting is intense. One battalion of the Chiang army was annihilated in the offensive. Chiang's offensive deployment against the Suwan Liberated Area concentrated a total of eleven corps (several of which are American-equipped) around the border area. His northern military base, Xuzhou, gathered a force of four corps, which reporters traveling there called a "mountain of soldiers" and a "city of soldiers." The area also has a hundred aircraft and dozens of tanks, continuously conducting land and air exercises, waiting to be dispatched. The Suwan Civil War is one of the central battlefields planned by Chiang after the Central Plains. His plan is to first eliminate the Suwan and Central Plains Liberated Areas, so as to withdraw the troops from the Longhai Railway and launch an all-out offensive against the North China and Northeast Liberated Areas, doing whatever he wants. Chiang's propaganda machine initially made unreasonable demands openly during the Nanjing negotiations and organized so-called "Su North Refugees," chanting "Armed return to Su North," attempting to force the CCP to withdraw from Su North. Then, they spread rumors that the CCP had agreed to cede Su North, in order to create a popular illusion. Finally, they fabricated war reports at length, falsely claiming "Communist troops invading," threatening Nanjing and Shanghai, in order to justify their attacks. However, when Chinese and foreign reporters requested to inspect the Yangtze River along the north of Nanjing, they were simply blocked. Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious to everyone! Our Suwan Military Region spokesman has issued a statement, stating that the local military and civilians, facing the Chiang army's offensive, are determined to resolutely defend themselves.

    Shandong Front: The war is progressing with increasing intensity along the Jiaoji Railway. The Chiang army concentrated the forces of five corps and fifteen divisions by air and sea, launching coordinated attacks in three sections: east, west, and center. The 12th, 96th, and 73rd Corps, based in Jinan, attacked eastward, and have invaded five county towns: Zhangqiu, Zouping, Jiyang, Zichuan, and Boshan, and the two major towns of Zhoucun and Zhangdian. The 8th Corps in the middle, except for leaving the Honorary First Division to occupy Weixian and Changle, advanced aggressively westward, and has joined the Chiang army attacking eastward from Jinan at Zhangdian. The US military's Seventh Fleet and the Qingdao-based Marine Corps (formerly known as the US Marine Corps Third Brigade) are stationed in Qingdao to guard the port for the Chiang army. The Chiang army's 54th Corps, invading westward from Qingdao, has invaded Jimo, Chengyang, and Jiaoxian on the east side, and is continuing to fiercely attack Gaomi. At the same time, Chiang's air force, in coordination with ground troops, is狂炸狂炸bombed wildly the political and military center of the Shandong Liberated Area, the city of Linyi, and the Jiaoji Railway and its surrounding CCP troop defenses. It is generally estimated that the Chiang army's action plan in Shandong is to first expand the periphery of Qingdao and Jinan, and open the Jiaoji Railway, and then coordinate with the troops deployed along the Longhai Line to attack the entire Shandong. However, two-fifths of the Jinan Railway is in the hands of the Eighth Route Army. It will be difficult for the Chiang side to use force to connect the entire line and maintain regular military transportation in the future. Recently, the Chiang side continued to transport five American-equipped police corps to Xuzhou, and the first and second corps have been airlifted to Qingdao to intensify the offensive against the people of Shandong, but they themselves also feel that the war is not very promising.

    Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Front: The three regions of eastern Henan, southern Shanxi, and northern Henan are simultaneously suffering from the brutal offensive of the Chiang army. The Chiang army's 55th and 68th Corps in eastern Henan continue to "encircle and suppress" the Eighth Route Army between Qi County, Sui County, and Tuocheng, and are forcing residents along the Kaifeng, Lanfeng, and Shangqiu lines to dig a blockade line one zhang wide and one zhang five chi deep, in an attempt to cut off the natural connection between eastern Henan and Ji-Lu-Yu, and carry out its plan of attacking them separately. The local military and civilians heroically defended themselves, annihilating five battalions of the invading army in the latter half of last month. In northern Henan, Chiang Kai-shek used the Daoqing Railway as a base and Xinxiang as a gathering point, concentrating the forces of six corps around it. Since the 29th of last month, all passenger cars from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang have been suspended, and large quantities of troops and ammunition have been continuously transported north, with three divisions arriving successively. The Chiang army's 85th and 32nd Corps, originally stationed in Xinxiang and west of it, moved west to Xiuwu and Huojia, while a part of the 90th Corps crossed the Yellow River from the north and entered Meng County in northern Henan, taking over the defense of the 53rd Division, and the 53rd Division was withdrawn as a mobile force, attempting to join the Chiang army on the Daoqing Line to attack and seize the important coal-producing area of Jiaozuo Town. Just as the Chiang army was deploying a large-scale offensive in southern Shanxi and northern Henan, an anti-civil war mutiny occurred in Gong County, a major town between Zhengzhou and Luoyang on the south bank of the Yellow River, by the 55th Division of the 38th Corps of the Northwest Army. In southern Shanxi, after the Chiang army's 27th Corps crossed the Yellow River secretly in Shanzhou, invading and occupying the entire line of Mao (Jindu) Zhang (dian) highway and many villages and towns, it joined forces with Hu Zongnan's 167th Division of the First Corps, originally stationed in Anyi. The 167th Division immediately attacked north along the Tongpu Railway, occupying Wenxi City on the 10th and continuing to invade the railway and highway junction of Houma Town. However, in the aforementioned battles in the Wenxi and Anyi areas, four regiments of the Chiang army have been annihilated. Currently, the Chiang army is attacking more than a hundred li of the Tongpu Line controlled by the Eighth Route Army north of Houma, attempting to open up the southern section of the Tongpu Road. And the other two divisions of Hu Zongnan's First Corps crossed the river from Chaoyi in Shaanxi to reinforce southern Shanxi.

    Northeast Front: Du Yuming's troops are making tentative attacks. Du Yuming's three divisions, deployed on a 300-li front on the south bank of the Songhua River, are attempting to cross north at any time, with the aim of attacking Harbin. The 88th Division of the 71st Corps, located in Jilin, and the 207th Division of the New Sixth Corps in Huadian, are preparing to attack Jiaohe and its eastern areas. Currently, the focus of Du's army's offensive in southern Manchuria is to open up the Shen (yang) Hai (long) Road and spy on the territory of Andong Province. After the two divisions of the New First Corps were transferred south to Haicheng and Dashiqiao as the main force for flanking from the south, the two divisions of the 52nd Corps on the Benxi front and one division in Meihekou on the northern flank are also ready. Du's army in Meihekou attacked Liubadan on the 13th. Therefore, a war centered on Andong may break out at any time.

    Closely related to military operations is the Chiang government's planned assassination of democrats in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, creating bloody terror to suppress the patriotic anti-civil war movement. Following the Xiaguan massacre, the famous democrats Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo were successively shot and killed by Chiang's secret agents in Kunming within three days. This is the beginning of Chiang Kai-shek's assassination of democrats according to his pre-prepared blacklist. At the same time, fascist bandits widely closed progressive bookstores and newspapers in major cities, and banned many books and periodicals. The most serious situation during this period was in Guangzhou and Beiping, where almost all progressive books and newspapers were "swept away." The Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters is preparing to arrest and kill democrats. The Shanghai Wenhui Daily was temporarily ordered to suspend publication on a trivial pretext. Informed people believe that Chiang Kai-shek's ruffian behavior will arouse a stronger wave of opposition from the people across the country. The fact that more than 140 celebrities in Ping City, such as Zhang Dongsun, sent a telegram calling on the people to carry out a broad anti-civil war movement is one example.

　　蒋介石悍然中止南京和平谈判
    登牯岭了望全国内战烽火
    【新华社延安十九日电】蒋介石悍然中止南京的和平谈判，于本月十四日突然至牯岭游山玩水，而当他在庐山登高眺望时，其一手布置之全国规模的内战野火，则已日益蔓延。
    中原方面：李先念部六万鄂豫皖子弟兵，冲破了三十万蒋军的包围，蒋介石上月二十九日的第一个“围歼”计划失败后，又于本月七日再颁手令，令步兵跟踪追击、堵击，空军配合轰炸，必欲“全部歼灭”我中原部队。平汉路西，蒋军追击部队共分三路，其四十一军、四十七军向内乡、淅川方面追击，其十军、十五军向光化、老河口一带猛进，其中十六军、七十五军，则开达襄阳、宜城的汉水一线；同时，陕西胡宗南部之九十军六十一师和第九军二○六师，已开抵陕北边境之荆紫关、武关一带，正继续东进，企图配合追击部队，施行东西夹击。当李先念部抢渡湍急宽阔之汉水，蒋军飞机猛炸两岸渡口，企图歼灭中原部队于汉水之畔，但此一阴谋，并未得逞。另向东突围之李先念部，正与蒋军七十二军激战于黄安、麻城。由于蒋介石“围歼”心切，命令部队日夜兼程穷追，士兵毫无休息，且时遭鞭笞，中下级官兵颇多厌倦不满。而蒋“围歼”未成，迁怒于其部队作战不力，若干军长师长均受处分，于是益增军中愤懑之情，日前遂有七十二军十三师三十余人拒绝内战。
    苏皖方面：蒋介石对苏皖解放区的大规模进攻，已于十五日在长江北岸来安至南通四百里战线上首先展开，已经出动的蒋军，有来安第五军、八十七军、四军、暨二十五军，泰州一百军，南通四十九军，崇明二十一军，以天长、高邮、如皋等地为侵夺目标，发动猛烈攻击，已在来安、六合方面，占去水口镇、雷官渠、新黄港等村镇十余处；南通、靖江、泰州、泰兴方面，夺我林×、丁堰、黄桥、姚家岱等军事要地多处，刻正猛攻如皋县城，战况激烈。蒋军有一个营在进攻中被消灭。蒋对苏皖解放区之进攻部署，集中于边区周围之部队共达十一个军（其中有几个军是美械军），其北线军事基地徐州，即集结四个军之众，旅行该地记者称之为“兵山”“兵城”，该地尚集有飞机百架，坦克数十辆，连日不断进行陆空临阵演习，待机出动。苏皖内战为蒋继中原之后所布置的中心战场之一，其计划在于首先消灭苏皖、中原两解放区、以便抽出陇海路部队，倾窠进攻华北、东北各解放区，放手为所欲为。蒋家宣传机关，初则在南京谈判中公开提出无理要求，并组织所谓“苏北难民”，高唱“武装打回苏北去”，企图压迫中共退出苏北；继则造谣说中共已答应让出苏北，以造成人民错觉；最后即成篇累牍的捏造战报，谣传“共军出犯”，威胁京沪，以为自己打人张本。但当中外记者要求亲至南京以北长江沿线视察，则又干脆拦驾，司马昭之心，路人皆知！我苏皖军区发言人已发表谈话，表明当地军民面临蒋军进攻，决心坚决自卫。
    山东方面：战争正以日益增涨的猛烈性沿胶济路进行中。蒋军以空运海运集中了五个军十五个师的兵力，分东西中三段配合攻击。以济南为基地的十二军、九十六军、七十三军向东攻击，已侵陷章邱、邹平、济阳、淄川、博山五个县城，和周村、张店两巨镇。其中路第八军除留荣誉一师盘踞潍县、昌乐外，向西猛进，已与自济南东犯的蒋军会合于张店。青岛驻有美军第七舰队及驻青海军陆战队（前称美海军陆战队第三旅团）替蒋军看守港口；由青岛西侵之蒋军五十四军于东面侵陷即墨、城阳、胶县后，正继续猛攻高密。同时蒋家空军配合地面部队，狂炸山东解放区政治军事中心临沂县城，与胶济路及其两侧中共部队防地。一般估计：蒋军在山东之行动计划，第一步在扩张青岛、济南外围，打通胶济路，然后与布置于陇海沿线之部队，配合进攻山东全境。但目前济路五分之二，在八路军手中，蒋方要想以武力贯通全线，保持今后经常军运，亦属难能。最近蒋方继续增运五个美械装备的警察总队至徐州，其中一、二两总队且已空运青岛，来加剧对山东人民的进攻，然彼等自己亦感到战争并无多大把握。
    晋冀鲁豫方面：豫东、晋南及豫北三个地区，同时正遭受蒋军残酷的进攻。豫东蒋军五十五军及六十八军继续向杞县、睢县、拓城间的八路军“围剿”，并在开封、兰封、商邱一线，强迫居民挖掘宽一丈、深一丈五尺的封锁线，以图切断豫东与冀鲁豫间的自然联系，而行其各个击破之计。当地军民英勇自卫，上月下半月歼灭进犯军五个营。豫北蒋介石以道清路为基础，新乡为集结点，周围集中了六个军的兵力。上月二十九日起，郑州至新乡客车全部停运，大批部队军火陆续北运，先后开抵三个师。其原驻新乡及其以西之蒋军八十五军、三十二军各一部，则西开修武、获嘉，同时九十军一部由黄河北渡，进入豫北孟县，接防五十三师防务，五十三师即抽出作为机动兵力，图与道清线之蒋军合击与夺取重要煤产区焦作镇。正于蒋军在晋南、豫北部署大举进攻之际，黄河南岸位于郑州洛阳间重镇巩县，发生了西北军三十八军五十五师的反内战兵变。山西南部自蒋军二十七军在陕州偷渡黄河，侵陷矛（津渡）张（店）公路全线与村镇多处后，与原驻安邑的胡宗南第一军一六七师会合，一六七师旋即沿同蒲路北攻，于十日侵占闻喜城，并继续北陷铁路与公路连接点侯马镇。但在上述闻喜、安邑地区战事中，蒋军已有四个团溃灭。现蒋军正向侯马以北八路军控制之同蒲线百余里防地攻击，企图打通同蒲路南段。而胡宗南第一军之另两个师，由陕西朝邑渡河，增援晋南。
    东北方面：杜聿明部队正作试探性的进攻，布置于松花江南岸三百里战线上的杜聿明三个师，随时企图北渡，以哈尔滨为目标展开攻击。位置在吉林的七十一军八十八师、桦甸的新六军二○七师，则作进攻蛟河及其以东地带的准备。而目前南满杜军的进攻重心，在于打通沈（阳）海（龙）路及窥犯安东省境。驻海龙之五十二军一九五师及驻抚顺之六十军一部，正南北夹击控制在民主联军手中的以清原为中心的百余里铁路。对于安东省的进攻，自新一军的两个师南调海城、大石桥作为由南面迂回的主力后，其本溪正面的五十二军两个师及北翼梅河口一个师，亦已准备就绪。梅河口杜军并于十三日向六八旦进攻，故以安东为中心的战争，随时有展开可能。
    与军事行动密切相关联的，是蒋政府在国民党区有计划的暗杀民主人士，制造血腥恐怖，以镇压爱国主义的反内战运动。继下关惨案之后，著名民主人士李公朴、闻一多，三天之内相继在昆明被蒋记特务公然乱枪刺杀，这是蒋介石按其预拟之黑名单暗杀民主人士的开端。同时法西斯匪徒在各大城市广泛封闭进步的书店报纸，查禁许多书报刊物，此一时期情形最严重者为广州、北平，几乎所有进步书报，均被“一网打尽”，广州行营且准备继而捕杀民主人士。上海文汇报被一个小小借口，暂令停刊。有识人士，认为蒋介石此种流氓行为，将引起全国人民更有力的反对怒潮。平市名流张东荪等百四十余人，通电号召国人进行广大反内战运动，即其一例。
