　　Xinhua News Agency, Rugao, 21st: Chiang's troops have launched a large-scale offensive against our liberated areas. On the southern front, along the north bank of the Yangtze River, from Lai'an, Liuhe, through Jiangdu, Taixian, Taixing, to Jingjiang and Nantong, the deployed forces amount to 100,000, all under the command of Tang Enbo. They have successively occupied important villages and towns in the liberated areas such as Babaiqiao, Shuikouzhen, Leiguanji, Huangqiao, Yaojiadai, Linzi, and Dingyan. For the sake of self-defense, the New Fourth Army launched a counterattack starting on the 15th, wiping out the 19th Brigade of the newly formed 83rd Division (formerly the 17th Division of the 100th Army) of Chiang's troops invading the Taixing area. All six thousand plus soldiers of that brigade laid down their weapons. The five regiments of the 49th Army of Chiang's troops, which pounced on Rugao County, the location of the Su皖 liberated area's first administrative office, were surrounded by the New Fourth Army in the areas south of Dingyan, southwest of Rugao, north of Matang, and south of Hejiaba respectively. By the evening of the 19th, all three regiments of the 26th Division of that army were wiped out, and the two regiments of the 79th Division suffered devastating blows. In this battle, Chiang's troops who laid down their weapons numbered over six thousand, including the army commander Wang Tiehan. The 49th Army was composed of Northeastern Army elements mixed with other components. At the end of last year, Chiang transferred the army to central Jiangsu to participate in the civil war, and this time he used it as the vanguard for invading the central Jiangsu liberated area, intending to eliminate dissidents.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 21st】Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against the Su皖 liberated area has expanded from the southern front along the Yangtze River to the western front (Jinpu Railway) and the northern front (Longhai Railway), and fierce fighting is in full swing. In the central Jiangsu area, the 49th Army based in Nantong and Baipu, the 65th Army based in Jingjiang, and the 25th Army based in Taizhou and Qintong, totaling about 70,000 men, have been advancing in a three-pronged encirclement since the 15th, launching converging attacks on the vast area south of Rugao and Taizhou. After occupying Taixing City, Xuanjiabao, Jijiashi, Huangqiao, Linzi, Dingyan and other places, they occupied Jiangyan Town, a strategic military point between Taizhou and Rugao, on the 19th, and continued to expand their offensive. Their initial attempt is to occupy and open the two highways from Nantong to Rugao and from Taixing to Taizhou, and then use these two lines as bases to launch a fierce attack on the central area of Su皖. The New Fourth Army is currently blocking them near Rugao and Taizhou. In the Huainan area, the 96th Division and the 45th Division of the Fifth Army, which set out from Lai'an and Liuhe in separate routes, occupied key towns such as Babaiqiao, Shuikouzhen, and Leiguanji, and then captured Tuncang (north of Lai'an), Zhuzhenji (forty li northwest of Liuhe), and Dongcao and Fanjiaji on the 18th. On the 19th, under the cover of aircraft, they occupied Chongshan and Dajingzhao, thirty li south of Tianchang. On the afternoon of the 18th, a Chiang aircraft was shot down over Maji, five or six li southwest of Tianchang. Currently, the Chiang army on this route is advancing towards Tianchang. The Chiang army along the Jinpu Railway line south of Xuzhou to north of Mingguang is launching an eastward offensive in four routes. One route is part of the 58th Division of the 74th Army, which set out from Jiagou on the 17th and occupied Ludianji (thirty-five li east of Jiagou) and other places belonging to Xiaosu and Tong counties (newly established counties) on the 18th. Another route is part of the 171st Division of the Seventh Army, which advanced from Mingguang and occupied Gangziji and other places belonging to Xuyi and Jia counties (newly established counties) on the 18th. Another route is the 515th Regiment of the 172nd Division of the Seventh Army, which advanced from Huangheji northeast of Guzhen on the afternoon of the 18th and occupied Yanlukou and other places southwest of Lingbi, attempting to peek into Lingbi City. One route, the 511th Regiment of the 171st Division, with more than 1,000 men, advanced towards Wuhe from Xingqiao Station at 2 pm on the 18th and occupied Yuanjiatun, west of Wuhe. On the northern front, the 28th Army, which advanced from Xuzhou, occupied Yuanshan on the Longhai Line on the 18th and continued to advance towards Zhutoushan. Parts of the 98th Army of Chiang's troops and the puppet traitor Xu Jitai's troops stationed in Xinpu and Haizhou occupied Shangfangjie, forty li southeast of Haizhou, while the Third Pre-Division of that army attacked Fangcun from the southeast of Xuzhou. On the 18th, four aircraft were dispatched to bomb Yunhe Station and ferry crossings. For days, airplanes have been dropping absurd leaflets everywhere, claiming that "the Central Army is determined to eliminate the Communist Army" and "with American aid, the CCP's power can be eliminated within three months." Currently, the entire military and civilians of Su皖 are resolutely fighting back.
