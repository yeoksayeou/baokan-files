Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th: Chongqing News: The Shanghai Da Mei Evening News published on July 9th a dispatch from United Press reporter Rundle stating: The Chinese government has proposed to the U.S. State Department that Mr. R. Allen, Director of the Chinese Branch of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) be immediately replaced, on the grounds that he should not criticize the Chinese government's mishandling of UNRRA relief materials. After the Chinese government's proposal, 300 staff members of the UNRRA Chinese Branch jointly sent a telegram to UNRRA Director LaGuardia, condemning the Chinese government for using relief materials and UNRRA work as political weapons, resulting in the accumulation, waste, spoilage, and theft of valuable and hard-to-obtain materials from other countries, leaving the hungry still hungry and those in need without assistance. UNRRA personnel also stated that less than two percent of the relief materials shipped to China were allowed to be transported to the CCP-controlled areas (in reality, it was only 0.59 percent). The telegram further pointed out that the Chinese government failed to comply with Article 1, Item 7 and Article 2 of the UNRRA Regulations on the Distribution of Relief and Rehabilitation Materials, and disregarded the Chinese Branch's numerous proposals. UNRRA materials were still not distributed to many areas for political reasons, discriminating against those areas based on the people's political beliefs. It would be reasonable, albeit unfortunate, if UNRRA could not transport relief materials to the needy areas in the interior that cannot guarantee receipt due to the continued improper handling by the Chinese government. According to the Continental Daily News on the 8th, UNRRA will soon send personnel to China to replace the work of Mr. Allen.

　　联总中国分署职员联名揭露
    蒋政权盗窃救济品
    阻挠救济物资来解放区
    【新华社南京十六日电】渝讯：七月九日上海大美晚报载合众社记者郎德尔的通讯称：中国政府已向美国国务院提议，要求立即撤换联总中国分署署长雷氏，理由是认为他不应该批评中国政府处理联总救济物资失当。在中国政府提议后，联总中国分署三百个职员即联名致电联总署长拉加第亚，责斥中国政府利用救济物资、联总工作作为政治武器，结果使贵重的别国难以得到的物资排积、浪费、腐烂与被窃，使饿者仍饥，需要者无着。联总人员又称：运来中国的救济物资，其中允许运到中共地区者，不及百分之二（其实只有百分之零点五十九）。该电更指出：中国政府不遵照联总关于善后救济物资分配条例第一条第七项及第二条的规定，也不顾中国分署无数次的提议，联总物资仍以政治原因未分配到许多地方去，由于人民政治信仰的不同，而对那些地区歧视。如果由于中国政府的继续不能适当处理而使联总不能将救济物资运到内地亟需要而又不能保证收到的地区去，则虽属合理，亦属不幸。另据八日大陆报载：联救总署不久将派员来华代替雷氏的工作。
