　　Deliberately Expanding the Civil War and Bringing Suffering to the People
    Chiang Kai-shek's Side Obstructs Mediation in Southern Shanxi
    Chiang Secretly Orders the Elimination of Our Army in Eastern Henan Within a Time Limit
    [This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch on the 26th] The Linfen Executive Group for mediating the war in southern Shanxi has achieved no results due to the Kuomintang's obstruction. On the 12th, after overcoming the Kuomintang's repeated delays and obstructions, the Linfen Executive Group flew to Yuncheng for inspection. After investigation, the group concluded that: Chiang's army violated the agreement by occupying more than 300 important towns and cities such as Maojin, Zhangdian, Shuitou, and Wenxi, and is currently continuing to expand its northward offensive, causing the broad masses of people in southern Shanxi to suffer the devastation of civil war again. The group immediately decided to first order the Kuomintang to cease its offensive, then go to our side to hear the report of our military authorities, and then convene a meeting of commanders from both sides to conduct mediation. However, the Kuomintang was determined to continue expanding the offensive, and refused to sign the mediation. The representative unreasonably claimed that "the Kuomintang army is not attacking the Communist troops, but is 'suppressing bandits' and 'recovering lost territory'." Our representative solemnly stated that if the Kuomintang did not withdraw from the aforementioned occupied areas, we would resolutely carry out self-defense and counterattack the invaders, and the Kuomintang would be responsible for all consequences. At this point, the group's mediation came to a halt. After the group returned to Linfen, it planned to go to Xinjiang for mediation, but was openly rejected by the Kuomintang. Finally, the group proposed to meet with our military commander in Houma. At this time, Yan's army was actively cooperating with Chiang's army in southern Shanxi, launching an offensive from Shicun and Quwo Mengcheng in Xinjiang towards Gaoxian and Houma. The Kuomintang again used the excuse that the situation in Linfen Houma was unclear, and refused the group to go for mediation. Instead, it unilaterally demanded that our military commander go to Linfen, in an attempt to take the opportunity to launch a large-scale offensive against us. This conspiracy was resolutely rejected by our side. At this point, the group's mediation was completely impossible to proceed.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 26th] Chiang Kai-shek's secret order to eliminate the Eighth Route Army in the eastern Henan area within a time limit was seized from the hands of the puppet army under Zhang Lanfeng in the Zecheng self-defense battle on the 12th of this month. One of them stated: "Secret telegram to Director Liu (referring to Liu Ruming, Director of the Fourth Pacification Zone) Wuqi (July 8): Received Chairman Chiang's Wuwei (July 5) telegram: Order Zhang (referring to puppet army Zhang Lanfeng) to strengthen the encirclement and suppression of the bandits (referring to the Eighth Route Army) in the area of Qixian, Tongxu, Taikang, and Juyi in eastern Henan, and strive to clear them by the end of July. ... In addition to a separate telegram, a special telegram." In addition, there were also documents ordering the 55th Army and other units to transfer automobiles and convert them into rapid units for blocking and encircling.
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch on the 26th] After our army entered Qinxian, the puppet army under Duan Bingchang has been fleeing along Dongguan and north of Qinxian for days. After passing through the Wufeng Mountain Ridge and South Gate of Wuxiang, and Laiyuan Town and Dongguan Town southeast of Qixian, they retreated to Taigu City. The Yan-Japanese puppet coalition army's 21st and 22nd engineer regiments, originally stationed in Taigu City, have also been completely transferred to Taiyuan, except for two companies left behind. At this point, Qinxian Wuxiang south of Laiyuan on the Dongqin line has been completely liberated.

　　蓄意扩大内战涂炭人民
    蒋方梗阻晋南调处
    蒋竟密令限期消灭豫东我军
    【本报阳城二十六日电】调处晋南战事的临汾执行小组，由于国方百般阻挠，致小组调处，毫无结果。十二日，临汾执行小组克服国方百般拖延阻挠后，始飞往运城视察，经调查结果，小组认为：蒋军违约侵占我茅津、张店、水头、闻喜等重要城镇三百余处，目前仍在继续扩大向北进攻，致使晋南广大人民，重罹内战浩劫，此种事实完全应由国方负责。小组当即决定首先下令国方停止进攻，再赴我方，听取我军当局报告，然后召集双方指挥官会议，进行调处。但国方决心继续扩大进攻，遂拒绝签字调处，该代表无理狡称：“国军并非进攻中共部队，而系‘剿匪’与‘收复失地’”。我方代表对国方此种无理诬蔑，故意破坏调处，乃郑重声明称：若国方不退出上述侵占地区，我将坚决进行自卫，予侵犯者以反击，其一切后果，应由国方负责。至此，小组调处即告停顿。小组返临汾后，拟再赴新绛调处，亦遭国方公开拒绝。最后小组提议赴候马与我军指挥官会晤，此时阎军正积极配合晋南蒋军由新绛史村、曲沃蒙城向我高显、候马等地进攻，国方又以临汾候马情况不明为遁词，拒绝小组前往调处，反而片面要求我军指挥官前往临汾，以图乘机向我大举进攻，此种阴谋当遭我方严正拒绝。至此，小组调处已完全无法进行。
    【新华社邯郸二十六日电】蒋介石限期消灭豫东地区八路军之密令，本月十二日八路军于柘城自卫战中，从张岚峰部伪军手中缴获，其中一件称：“密刘主任（按即第四绥区主任刘汝明）午齐（七月八日）电开：奉主席蒋午微（七月五日）电开：豫东杞县、通许、太康、雎县一带奸匪（指八路军），令张（按即伪军张岚峰）各部，加强围剿，务于七月底前肃清。……除另电外，特电”。此外，并有命令五五军等部抽调汽车，改为快速部队进行堵击围剿等文件。
    【本报长治二十六日电】我军进驻沁县后，伪军段炳昌部，连日沿东观、沁县北窜。经武乡分水岭、南关，祁县东南之来远镇、东观镇退踞太谷城，原驻太谷城之阎日伪联军二十一、二十二两工兵团，除留下两连外，亦全部开往太原。至此，东沁线来远以南之沁县武乡全获解放。
