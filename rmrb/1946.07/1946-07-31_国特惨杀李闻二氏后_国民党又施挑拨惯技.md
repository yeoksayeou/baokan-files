　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Shanghai News: After Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were tragically assassinated by secret agents, the Kuomintang newspapers here have been spreading rumors. The editorials in the Central Daily News and Shen Bao insinuate that the CCP was responsible. The Southeast Daily News said: The assassin of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen was the son of Long Yun, the Chairman of Yunnan Province. Shen Bao also said that Long Yun's son had "fled to the mountains." Generally, people believe that the Kuomintang fascist faction is imitating Hitler's burning of the Reichstag in a shameful drama, plotting to frame others, just as Mr. Zhang Dongsun of the China Democratic League said, which is tantamount to confessing their own actions. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented: After committing murder, to falsely accuse others of being the murderers is originally the most despicable and shameless tactic of the fascist faction. In the Kunming tragedy last December, the fascist faction fabricated a so-called "confession" by Jiang Kai, claiming that the tragedy was committed by the Communist Party. In the Chongqing Jiaochangkou tragedy in February this year, the fascist faction again referred to Mr. Li Gongpu, Mr. Zhang Naiqi and others who were beaten and injured by secret agents in the tragedy as "murderers." The Kuomintang fascist faction's despicable tricks are emerging endlessly after the deaths of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen. At the same time, this new rumor and slander by the Kuomintang fascist faction also contains a vicious conspiracy to eliminate dissidents. After the "13th Incident," when Long Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, was taken to Chongqing, the fascist faction's oppression of the local forces in Yunnan became increasingly severe, such as dismissing Long Chunwu (Long Yun's son), commander of the temporarily organized 19th Division of the Yunnan Army, surrounding and "reorganizing" the officers and soldiers of the division, and recently illegally searching the residences of Zhang Weihan, the supervisor of Yunnan and Guizhou, An Sipu, the former commander of the 60th Army of the Yunnan Army, and the former Yunnan Gendarmerie Commander, etc. This time, the rumor and slander against Long Yun's son, occurring after this series of events, is not accidental.

　　国特惨杀李闻二氏后
    国民党又施挑拨惯技
    【新华社延安二十八日电】沪讯：李、闻二氏惨遭特务暗杀后，此间国民党的报纸即大肆造谣。中央日报与申报社论中含沙射影，说此为中共所为。东南日报说：暗杀李闻二氏者，为云南省主席龙云之子。申报又说：龙云之子已“逃往山地”。一般人咸认为国民党法西斯派效法希魔焚烧国会的丑剧，阴谋嫁祸于人，正如民盟张东荪氏所谓无异自供自己所为。新华社记者评称：行凶杀人之后，复诬别人为凶手，这本是法西斯派最卑鄙最无耻的惯技。去年十二月昆明惨案，法西斯派制造所谓姜凯的“口供”，如称惨案系共产党所为。今年二月重庆较场口惨案，法西斯派复指惨案中被特务打伤的李公朴、章乃器等先生为“凶手”。国民党法西斯派此种卑鄙技俩，在李闻二氏被害后更层出不穷，同时国民党法西斯派这次新的造谣诬蔑，还包含着消灭异己的恶毒阴谋。“十、三”事变，云南省政府主席龙云被劫住重庆后，法西斯派对云南地方势力压迫日甚，如将滇军暂编第十九师师长龙纯武（龙云之子）撤职，包围“整编”之该师官兵，最近更非法搜查云贵监察使张维翰，前滇军六十军军长安思溥及前云南宪兵司令等住宅等等，此次造谣诬害龙云之子，发生在这一连串事件之后，并不是偶然的。
