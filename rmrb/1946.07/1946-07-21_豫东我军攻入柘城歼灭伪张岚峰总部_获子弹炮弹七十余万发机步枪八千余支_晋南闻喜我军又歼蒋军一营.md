　　【Heze Dispatch, July 19th】The Yudu military and civilians, in their second counter-"encirclement," captured Zhecheng, a major town southwest of Gaoqiu and the old lair of Zhang Lanfeng, the puppet Fourth Route Army of Henan, on the 12th of this month. The eight departments of Zhang's headquarters entrenched in the city, a cavalry company and an infantry company directly under the special service regiment, and a security regiment were all annihilated by our forces. In addition to the killed and wounded, over 500 were captured alive, seizing two heavy machine guns, 36 light machine guns, over 150 pistols, 8,000 rifles, 700,000 rounds of ammunition, over 20,000 rounds of various artillery shells, and a portion of other spoils of victory. Zhang Lanfeng is a well-known puppet army in Henan. After the enemy surrendered, the Kuomintang reorganized him as the commander-in-chief of the Third Route Army. When the Kuomintang army launched a large-scale "encirclement" of the Yudu liberated area, this traitor actively cooperated in the operation. The local people were overjoyed upon hearing the news of our army's annihilation of his headquarters.
　　【Heze Dispatch, July 16th】The puppet Henan Security Brigade led by Sun Xingzhai, with over 2,000 troops, which invaded Sun Laojia, southeast of Caoxian County, has been routed by the local Eighth Route Army. This puppet force raided villages in the Sun Laojia area from its base in Hanshuanglou and Yaofulian villages in Caoxian County on the 7th and 8th to loot grain. Our local garrison resolutely counterattacked and repelled them. At dawn on the 9th, our army took advantage of the victory to directly attack the puppet's lair. After two hours of fierce fighting, over 200 puppet battalion and company commanders and soldiers were killed or wounded, 57 battalion commanders and soldiers were captured, three machine guns, over 100 rifles, and over 2,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. Over 40,000 kilograms of wheat looted from the masses were also recovered and returned to their original owners. The local masses were extremely excited upon hearing the news and went to comfort the troops.
　　【Yangcheng Dispatch, July 19th】On the 4th of this month, Hu Zongnan's New Second Division, which crossed the river from Chaoyi, Shaanxi, and invaded Shuitou, Wenxi, continued to invade the Eighth Route Army's defense area north of Shuitou on the afternoon of the 16th. It was met with resolute resistance, and the entire Chiang army was repelled, with one battalion annihilated, killing or wounding over 300, capturing over 100 alive, and seizing four mortars, two anti-tank guns, two small cannons, six heavy machine guns, and over 100 rifles. Our army's position remained unshaken.
　　【Yangcheng Dispatch, July 19th】The 196th Regiment of the 66th Division and the 117th Regiment of the 39th Division of Yan Xishan's army, which cooperated with Chiang’s army in southern Shanxi to attack, set out from Shicun, Fencheng, at dawn on the 17th and invaded Mengcheng, a key town on the Tongpu Railway in Quwo, in three routes. Yan's army violated the agreement and invaded Mengcheng, which was the second time. The first time was on January 15, the second day after the ceasefire order.
