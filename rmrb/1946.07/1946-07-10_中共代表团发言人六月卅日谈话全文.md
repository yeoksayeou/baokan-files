Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 5th: The spokesperson for the CCP Delegation stationed in Nanjing issued a statement on June 30th, denouncing Peng Xuepei's statement as self-contradictory, attempting to conceal the Kuomintang authorities' conspiracy to launch a large-scale attack on the Liberated Areas, and reiterated the CCP's demand for a long-term and comprehensive ceasefire, advocating for the convening of the Political Consultative Conference to resolve all issues. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Long-term ceasefire and comprehensive ceasefire have always been our consistent demands. Unfortunately, they have not been agreed to by the government authorities, resulting in the current precarious situation. During the eight days of extended ceasefire, general agreements have been reached on issues such as completely stopping the conflict in the Northeast, restoring transportation, and resolving certain disputes within the Executive Headquarters and its groups. As for the revised terms of the troop reorganization plan, thanks to General Marshall's tireless efforts, the enthusiastic efforts of the Third Party, and the CCP's greatest concessions, a preliminary agreement could have been reached. However, due to the government's insistence on unreasonable demands beyond the scope of troop reorganization and its violation of the resolutions and principles of the Political Consultative Conference on troop reorganization, the agreement failed. We express great regret over this. Today, the announcement made by Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, is in a very special form. On the one hand, it declares that the Central Army will not take military action against the Communist troops, but it does not state whether the government has issued such an order, and especially does not state whether this state of ceasefire is long-term or short-term. On the other hand, it fabricates rumors and slanders that the CCP troops are carrying out "military offensives" and "sabotaging transportation," so that it can take military action to "expel" the CCP troops under the pretexts of "self-defense," "protecting life and property," "maintaining local order," "implementing troop separation," and "restoring transportation," without any restrictions. Moreover, in actual actions, the government army has already made such arrangements. For example, against our Central Plains Military Region, the government army has launched a large-scale siege by twenty-one divisions, and its orders contain the words "annihilate." For example, against our Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area, the government is organizing so-called "refugee armed repatriation teams," preparing to forcibly enter Northern Jiangsu. For example, against our Shandong Liberated Area, the government army's Eighth Army is attacking on the Jiaoji Railway, and has already occupied Gaomi, Zhangqiu and other places. For example, against our Rehe Liberated Area, the government army is deploying troops (number missing) to attack Chengde. And these areas, except for the Central Plains Military Region, are precisely the areas where the government insists that the CCP withdraw completely. Therefore, we already suspect that Mr. Peng's rather special statement is indeed an attempt to cover up the above facts and create a pretext for new incidents. But no matter what, the CCP will still adhere to its position of striving for peace and opposing civil war, and is still willing to continue negotiations with the support of General Marshall to seek a political solution. Regardless of whether it is within or outside the Shanhaiguan Pass, we advocate a long-term ceasefire. Only by stopping all armed conflicts can transportation not be cut off and the people not be displaced. In order to avoid conflict, it is necessary to implement the separation of troops' stationed areas, but it must not be only the CCP side that is required to withdraw, and even more so, the local political institutions and public security organizations should not be transferred along with the troop movements. In order to reach an agreement, we have not hesitated to make significant concessions, but concessions should be mutual and should be limited. We must never make endless concessions. And the government should also show sincerity in the continued discussions in the Three-Person Committee, conduct thorough research, and convene the Political Consultative Conference to seek a complete solution to all agreements, so as to comfort the national people's hope for peace. We are deeply grateful for General Marshall's hard work, and hereby express our thanks.

　　中共代表团发言人
    六月卅日谈话全文
    【新华社延安五日电】中共驻京代表团发言人于六月三十日发表谈话，指斥彭学沛之声明自相矛盾，企图掩饰国民党当局对解放区大举进攻的阴谋，并重申中共长期全面停战要求，主张召开政协会议，解决一切问题。谈话全文如下：
    长期停战，全面停战，原为吾人一贯之主张，不幸未获政府当局同意，致形成目前突兀不定之局面。在延期休战的八天中，关于完全停止东北冲突、恢复交通及解决执行部与小组中某些争议等问题，均已获得一般协议。而整军方案之修改条款，因马歇尔将军不疲倦之努力，第三方面之热心奔走，与中共方面最大的让步，本可完成初步协议，惟因政府方面坚持无理要求超出整军范围，并破坏政协决议，整军原则，致协议未成，吾人对此表甚大遗憾。今日国民党中宣部长彭学沛所宣布之公告，其形式甚为特别，一方面声明中央军不对共军采取军事行动，但未说明政府方面是否已发布此项命令，尤其未说明此种休战状态是长期的抑是短期的；另方面却造谣诬蔑中共部队在进行“军事进攻”与“破坏交通”，以便其在“自卫”、“保卫生命财产”与“维持地方秩序”及“实行部队隔离”、“恢复交通”等借口下，可以采取军事行动“驱除”中共部队，不受任何限制。且在实际行动上，政府军队早已有此布置。如对我中原军区，政府军已经发动了二十一个师的大举围攻，其命令中有“聚歼”之语。如对我苏北解放区，政府正在组织所谓“难民武装还乡队”，准备武力打入苏北。如对我山东解放区，政府军第八军正在胶济路上进攻，并已占领高密、章邱等地。如对我热河解放区，政府军正在部署（中缺数字）向承德进攻之兵力。而这些地区，除中原军区外，正是政府方面坚持要求中共完全退出的地区。因此，我们已怀疑彭先生此项颇为特别的声明，确在企图掩饰如上事实，并为造成新的事件之口实。但不管怎样，中共方面仍坚持争取和平反对内战的立场，仍愿在马歇尔将军赞助之下继续商谈，求得政治解决。不分关内关外，我们都主张长期停战，只有停止一切武装冲突，交通才不致隔断，人民也不致流离。为避免冲突，实行军队驻地隔离是需要的，但决不能是只要求中共一方撤退，更不能因军队转移，连当地政治机构、治安组织都要跟随转移。我们为达成协议，曾不惜重大让步，但让步应是双方的，应是有限度的，我们绝不能作无止境之让步。而政府方面也应在三人会议继续商谈之中，拿出诚意多方研讨，并召开政协会议，求得一切协议的完满解决，以慰全国人民和平之望。我们于此深感马歇尔将军之勤劳，特此申谢。（按周恩来谈话，本社前曾根据中央社稿播发一次，但中央社对此谈话曾加删削，重要内容多被节略（见载本报七月四日第一版——编者），今收到全文，故再播发。——新华社）
