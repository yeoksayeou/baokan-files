　　Executive Headquarters Discusses Demobilization
    Kuomintang Authorities Show No Sincerity
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th] Beiping Dispatch: During the Executive Headquarters' discussion of the demobilization regulations draft and the issue of disarming puppet troops, which were drafted by the Military Tripartite Conference, it was revealed that the Kuomintang authorities had no sincerity in demobilization and intended to continue maintaining a massive army of millions for engaging in civil war. During the discussion of the former issue, the Kuomintang side resolutely opposed allowing discharged soldiers to return home to engage in production and enjoy family life. Kuomintang representatives initially argued sophistically, claiming, "Retiring home is the soldiers' wish, but it must comply with regulations, because the wish is personal, and the regulations are governmental," meaning that the wish should be subordinate to the regulations. After the US representative suggested a compromise, stating, "The wish of retired soldiers to return home is a goal, and the regulations are the means to achieve this goal," the Kuomintang representative was unable to refute, but still expressed opposition. After the meeting, they even publicly stated, "The government cannot abandon control over demobilized soldiers," their true intention being to preserve 1.5 million troops under the guise of engineer corps to carry out civil war. When discussing the issue of disarming puppet troops, the Kuomintang side only agreed in the meeting to "detain the highest-ranking officers of the puppet troops, and other officers would be detained after being reported and suspected of being traitors." However, after the meeting, they requested to add an addendum, namely, "excluding underground armies and guerrilla forces during the Anti-Japanese War," intending to maintain the puppet troops' armament under the pretext of "underground armies." This request was sternly rejected by the CCP and US representatives.

　　执行整军处讨论复员
    国民党当局毫无诚意
    【新华社延安十九日电】北平讯：执行整军处讨论军事三人会议所草拟之复员条例草案及解除伪军武装问题时，暴露国民党当局对整军复员毫无诚意，企图继续保持从事内战之数百万大军。会议中讨论前一问题时，国民党方面坚决反对允许退役军人回家生产，重享天伦之乐。国民党代表始则以强词狡称：“退役回家这是士兵的志愿，但要适合规定，因为志愿是个人的，规定是政府的”，意思是志愿应该服从规定。后经美方代表折衷提出：“退役军人志愿回家，这是个目的，而规定是达到这个目的的手段”。至此国民党代表无法答辩，但仍表示反对。会后且公然提出谓：“政府不能放弃对复员士兵的控制”，其真正意图，是以工兵纵队为名，保存一百五十万大军，以便进行内战。在讨论解除伪军武装问题时，国民党方面在会议中只同意“把伪军部队最高军官扣留，其他军官经检举后，有汉奸嫌疑者，再行扣留”。而在会后竟又要求加一个附注，即：“抗战期间之地下军及游击部队除外”，意图在“地下军”的借口下，保持伪军武装。此要求为中共与美方代表所严词拒绝。
