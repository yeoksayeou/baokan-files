Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 28th: U.S. news outlets expose the Chinese reactionaries' conspiracy to launch a civil war and eliminate the CCP. A July 24th editorial in the New York Herald Tribune (national organ of the Republican Party) stated, "We cannot ignore or deny Madame Sun's remarks about the fact that Chinese reactionaries are attempting to launch a civil war." The report stated: There are signs that Chinese reactionaries are attempting to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party. It continued: Any American power in China, including the pressure generated by granting or refusing financial aid, should be used to contribute to the establishment of a united government, the power of which should be held by free people. A July 23rd editorial in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette stated: "Unless the warmongers lay down their arms and establish a united government that is in line with the spirit of democracy, we should adhere to the principle of promoting peace in China if we want to continue any military assistance." (Note: Before a true united government is established, any military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek will only fuel the Chinese civil war.)

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 28th: According to a July 8th special dispatch from the Ta Kung Pao in Nanjing: Mr. Pei Fei, a recent American authority on Far Eastern affairs, told the newspaper reporter that the Chinese civil war must stop. What China urgently needs most is national unity and unification. If unity and unification cannot be achieved, the country's future will be hopeless, and it will lose its role in international politics. Pei Fei believes that "the future of domestic disputes is either a united government or continuous war," and "the war must stop, otherwise China's economy will collapse, inflation cannot be stopped, and transportation will not be smooth." Although Pei Fei tried his best to defend the current U.S. government's policy toward China, he still could not deny that "the United States' mediation of China's domestic disputes has failed to some extent." Pei Fei believes that "international relations, especially U.S.-Soviet relations, affect China's domestic problems. If U.S.-Soviet relations are better, the domestic situation will be better, and vice versa." Pei Fei believes that "Li Hongzhang, who was accustomed to using international contradictions, once used Germany to control England, and Russia to control Japan. For the past twenty years, he has used the United States to resist Japan. In the future, China must get out of the circle of international power politics. If it still has the intention of using the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union, it is self-destruction." Pei Fei even said in a warning tone: "No party in China can rely on a strong country behind it. Whether it hopes to use the Soviet Union to resist the United States, or use the United States to resist the Soviet Union, it is a crazy idea. If war is provoked by using the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union, it will not destroy either the United States or the Soviet Union, but China."

　　美报揭露国民党反动派阴谋
    主张中国民主团结     
    内战不停经济将趋于崩溃
    美国一切援助应贡献给一联合政府
    【新华社延安二十八日电】美新闻处二十六日电：美各报揭露中国反动分子发动内战阴谋消灭中共之幻想。纽约前锋论坛报（共和党全国性机关报）二十四日社论称：“孙夫人的言论，实不容我们忽视或否认他所称中国反动派企图发动内战之事实”。该报称：中国反动派确有企图肃清中国共产党之迹象。继称：任何美国在华力量，包括允予或拒绝金融援助所产生之压力，均应用以贡献与设立一联合政府，此项政府之政权应握于自由人士手中。匹兹堡邮报二十三日社论略称：“除非好战分子放下武器，并设立一符予民主精神之联合政府，则我们若欲继续任何军事援助，均应以促成中国和平为原则”。（按：在真正的联合政府成立以前，任何对蒋军事援助，适足助长中国内战而已）。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】据大公报南京七月八日专电报导：新近来华的美国远东问题权威裴斐氏对该报记者的谈话，表示中国内战必须停止，中国所最迫切需要者为国家之团结统一，若不能达到团结统一，国家前途必毫无希望，在国际政治上必将失掉作用。裴氏认为“国内纠纷之前途，非联合政府便是不断的战争”，而“战争必须停止，否则中国的经济将趋于崩溃，通货膨胀不能停止，交通亦不能畅流”。裴氏虽竭力辩护美国政府现行对华政策，但仍无法否认“美国对中国国内纠纷的调处，在某种程度是失败了”。裴氏认为“国际关系，尤其是美苏关系，影响着中国国内的问题，如果美苏的关系好一些，国内的情形也要好些，反之亦然。裴氏认为“中国惯于利用国际矛盾的李鸿章，曾以德制英，以俄制日，二十年以来则是以美国抗日，今后中国必须自出国际权势政治之圈。若仍存利用美苏之间矛盾的企图，是自取灭亡”。裴氏甚至于以警告的口气说：“中国任何一方面，都不能依赖于背后的强国，无论希望以苏抗美，或以美抗苏，都是以疯癫的想法，假使因为利用美苏矛盾而煽起战争，毁灭的不是美苏任何一方面，而是中国”。
