　　【Handan News】Twenty-five workers from the Flour Mill Branch of the Handan Municipal Industrial Workers' Union have recently voluntarily confessed to their past history of serving in the puppet police guard, the Public Security Bureau's special service team, as Japanese translators, etc., due to the pressure of making a living. Yang Song, a worker who had served in the puppet police guard, said with tears in his eyes: "We were already too poor to survive, and the enemy kept asking us to support them, to give them things, and then we had a famine. My grandmother ate wild vegetables until her whole body was swollen, and she died. I had nothing to eat, so I joined the enemy's police guard. I am sorry to everyone, sorry to the people. I know I am guilty, and I ask everyone to punish me." When everyone forgave him and gave him advice, he sincerely expressed that he would actively produce and study hard under the leadership of the trade union to be a good person. He said that his mother had once told him: "In the past, you never brought back a grain of rice during the New Year or holidays, but now you can often bring rice and money home, and you have food and clothing. The Eighth Route Army and the Communist Party are so good to us, you must work hard and follow the Communist Party!" In fact, he is now working very hard in the factory. Wu Fenglin, who had been a soldier for the enemy for two months and then worked as a repairman in the enemy's military factory, confessed: "In order to bury my father and to pay off debts, I sold myself into conscription for three thousand yuan, helping the Japanese to fight against the Eighth Route Army and repairing guns and making bullets for the Japanese. This was harming the people and acting as a traitor and running dog. I regret it very much. My family used to have four people, eating only four taels of millet a day, mostly bran and vegetables; now there are two people, each with half a catty of millet, and sometimes we even eat white flour. I can never repay the Eighth Route Army's kindness in my lifetime!" Yang Qi, who was captured by the police guard and forced to be a soldier for a year, said: "My relatives and acquaintances live in the four city suburbs. Every day I had to check pedestrians for the enemy, oppressing my own people. When I saw the Japanese, I had to bow ninety degrees. I couldn't stand it and asked for a long leave, but the enemy refused and even beat me with fifty military sticks, and I couldn't move for many days. There was no way, so I sold the last few acres of land at home and got two thousand one hundred yuan, which I gave to the village head to redeem myself, but the village head cheated me; he wouldn't do it. I was so angry that I hit him twice, and he detained my grandfather for three days. My father starved and became ill, and died. Only the Eighth Route Army and the people are of one heart. As soon as they came, they distributed grain and increased wages. My younger brother used to beg for food, and he was so hungry that he looked like a ghost. Now he is raised so white and fat, and my family has bedding and covers, and we even eat noodles and meat during the holidays." The other twenty or so people each confessed to many similar facts. The workers warmly welcomed their confession, repentance, and starting anew, and the factory was filled with an atmosphere of unity and friendship.
