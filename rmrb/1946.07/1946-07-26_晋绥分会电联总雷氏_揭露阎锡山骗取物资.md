　　Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 21st. The Jin Sui Branch of the China Liberated Areas Relief Committee recently sent a telegram to Mr. Lei, Director of the China Branch of the United Relief, protesting the unfair distribution of relief supplies by the Xingzheng Yuan Relief Administration (XRRA) Jin-Cha-Sui Branch and exposing Yan Xishan's illegal act of fraudulently acquiring supplies in the name of relief and using them as political tools. The telegram stated: Our Jin Sui Border Region's Shanxi portion (Jin Northwest Liberated Area) governs eighteen complete counties including Xingxian, Kelan, Jingyuan, Linxian, Guoxian, etc., and twenty-three half-complete counties (only the county seats are in the hands of Yan's puppet troops) including Taiyuan, Fenyang, Pingyao, Jiexiu, etc., with a population of over four million. In addition, the population in Jining, Fengzhen and other places in Suiyuan is over 800,000. After eight years of resistance against the enemy behind enemy lines, the people have suffered heavy losses, coupled with the invasion of floods, droughts, insects and epidemics, with 698,400 people in urgent need of relief. Now, the XRRA Jin-Cha-Sui Branch's relief supplies for Shanxi, according to the branch's weekly reports from the 16th to the 28th issue, as of the end of June, the supplies shipped to Taiyuan include 31,600 bags of flour, 10,311 packages of clothing, 216 pieces of medicine, 37,752 boxes of milk and many other supplies, but so far our Jin Northwest region has not received any relief. The XRRA Jin-Cha-Sui Branch has also never sent anyone to contact our area. All relief supplies have been completely swallowed up by Yan Xishan under the guise of 105 counties, and diverted as capital for the civil war. For example, the stealthy use of relief flour as work rations for excavating the Yangwu River in Guoxian County, creating a military trench to sever the liberated area, is one example. This committee hereby lodges a serious protest on behalf of the four million people in northwestern Shanxi, requesting the United Relief to recover all the supplies Yan Xishan fraudulently obtained by impersonation, and to fairly and reasonably provide relief to the 700,000 disaster victims in our region.

　　晋绥分会电联总雷氏
    揭露阎锡山骗取物资
    【新华社兴县二十一日电】中国解放区救济委员会晋绥分会顷致电联总中国分署署长雷氏，抗议行总晋察绥分署对救济物资分配不公及揭露阎锡山假冒名义骗取物资充作政治工具之非法行为。原电略称：我晋绥边区山西部分（晋西北解放区）共辖兴县、岢岚、静乐、临县、崞县等十八个完整县及太原、汾阳、平遥、介休等二十三个半完整县（仅仅县城在阎伪军手中）人口四百余万人。另绥远集宁、丰镇等地人口八十余万，经过八年敌后抗战，人民损失惨重，加以水旱虫疫的侵袭，急待救济者即有六十九万八千四百余人。今行总晋察绥分署救济山西之物资，仅就该分署周报第十六期至二十八期所载，截至六月底已运抵太原物资计有面粉三一六○○袋，衣服一○三一一包，医药品二一六件，牛乳三七七五二箱及其他物资多种，但至今我晋西北地区未获得任何救济。晋察绥分署亦从未派员来我区联系，所有救济物资，完全为阎锡山假冒一○五县名义吞并，并移作内战资本，如偷用救济面粉为挖掘崞县阳武河的工粮，造成割裂解放区的军事壕沟即为一例。本会特代表晋西北四百余万人民提出严重抗议，请求联总追还阎锡山冒充骗取之全部物资，并公平合理的救济我区七十万灾民。
