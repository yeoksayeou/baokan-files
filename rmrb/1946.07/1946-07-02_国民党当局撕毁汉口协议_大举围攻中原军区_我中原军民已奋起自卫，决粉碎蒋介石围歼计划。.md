　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th – The Kuomintang authorities have brazenly torn up the agreement on the Central Plains issue signed in Hankou on May 10th by Xu, Zhou, and Bai, and have begun to implement Chiang Kai-shek's recently determined new annihilation plan against our Central Plains Military Region troops. The Kuomintang army's first-line troops, numbering approximately 100,000, encircling the Central Plains east of the Pinghan Railway, launched a massive offensive against Xuanhua Store, the central area of the Central Plains Military Region, at dawn on the 26th, from Xinyang, Luoshan, Guangshan, Jingfu, Huang'an, Huangpi, Xiaogan, and other locations, using intense artillery fire. They have already occupied important strongholds such as Huwan (under Jingfu County), Fotashan (under Huang'an County), Dengzhou, and Yangpingkou (north of Xiaogan), and fierce fighting is continuing. Chiang Kai-shek's encirclement and annihilation plan has been captured by our side. The plan orders the troops of the Fifth and Sixth Pacification Headquarters to "encircle and annihilate" our Central Plains troops in one fell swoop. The order states: "(1) The treacherous bandits and rebel troops are becoming increasingly active in concentrating their forces and launching offensives in Shandong (referring to disarming the puppet troops of national traitors). Your district should, according to the established plan, first quickly annihilate Li Xiannian's forces in central Hubei, which will be advantageous for our main force to fight later. (2) Liu Zhi in Zhengzhou will set up a command post in Zhumadian to unify the command of the following army corps: A, the Fifth Pacification Headquarters Commander Sun Zhen, commanding the 15th, 41st, 47th, and 174th Divisions, etc., all reorganized divisions; B, the Sixth Pacification Headquarters Zhou Dang, commanding the 66th, 75th, 72nd, etc., all reorganized divisions, to carry out suppression against the treacherous bandits in central Hubei. When the operation begins, the air force will closely coordinate with a powerful unit as appropriate. (3) The deployment of the army corps and the tasks and actions of each unit will be meticulously planned by Liu Zhi and submitted for approval. (4) The units responsible for the attack should secretly complete the encirclement situation and attack preparations before the 22nd of this month. The units implementing the attack should encircle and annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop on the day and time the attack begins. (5) In their actions, all units should pay attention to strictly preventing the treacherous bandits from sneaking away," etc. Since the Wuhan Agreement on May 15th, the Kuomintang army has continued to violate the agreement and continue to attack us, encircling our troops, reaching eleven armies and twenty-one divisions, plus local teams, totaling 310,000 people. Their encirclement is shrinking daily, and our side has repeatedly requested the Executive Headquarters for mediation to stop them, but to no avail. From the 22nd of this month, the Kuomintang army's reinforcements and war preparations have become even more tense. Until dawn on the 26th, the Kuomintang army began this planned and prepared encirclement and annihilation operation. Our Central Plains military and civilians have risen up in self-defense, determined to smash the Kuomintang army's encirclement and annihilation plan.

　　国民党当局撕毁汉口协议
    大举围攻中原军区
    我中原军民已奋起自卫，决粉碎蒋介石围歼计划。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】国民党当局悍然撕毁五月十日徐、周、白在汉口订立之关于中原问题的协议，开始实行蒋介石最近所定对我中原军区部队的新的围歼计划。包围中原平汉路东解放区的国民党军第一线部队，约十万人，已于二十六日拂晓起，自信阳、罗山、光山、经扶、黄安、黄陂、孝感等地，分路以猛烈炮火，向中原军区中心地区宣化店大举进攻，已占领我虎湾（经扶县属）、佛塔山（黄安县属）邓州、杨平口（孝感以北）等重要据点，激战正继续中。蒋介石的这一围歼计划，已为我方缴获。该计划，命令第五、第六两绥署部队“一举包围歼灭”我中原部队。该命令中称：“（１）奸匪叛军日趋积极集中兵力，在山东发动攻势（按指解除民族叛逆伪军武装），贵区应按既定计划先速歼鄂中李先念部，便尔后主力作战之利。（２）郑州刘峙在驻马店设指挥所，统一指挥下列各兵团：甲、第五绥署司令官孙震辖第十五、四十一、四十七及一百七十四师等各编整师；乙、第六绥署周砀辖第六十六、七十五、七十二等，各编整师，对鄂中奸匪实行进剿。作战开始，空军以有力一部，适合事宜密切联络。（３）兵团部署及各部队任务行动由刘峙精密计划，呈请核准。（４）担任攻击各部队，统于本月二十二日前，秘密完成包围情势及攻击准备。实施攻击各部队，应于攻击开始之日时，一举包围歼灭之。（５）各部队在其行动中，应注意严防奸匪伺隙潜窜”等语。按自五月十五日武汉协议以来，国民党军仍不断违反协定，继续向我进攻，包围我军部队，已达十一个军二十一个师，加上地方团队，共三十一万人。其包围圈每日缩小，我方不断向调处执行部要求制止，均无效果。本月二十二日起，国民党军增援备战尤形紧张，至二十六日拂晓，国民党军开始这一有计划有准备围歼行动。我中原军民已奋起自卫，决粉碎国民党军的围歼计划。
