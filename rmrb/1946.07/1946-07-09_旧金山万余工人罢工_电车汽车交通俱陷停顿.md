　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 3rd: United Press reports: San Francisco: Over thirteen thousand city-operated streetcar and automobile workers went on strike on the 1st, cutting off streetcar and automobile traffic, causing it to grind to a halt. The reason for the strike was the rejection of the workers' reasonable demands for increased wages.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 4th: United Press reports, July 3rd: More than one thousand Northwest Airlines machine workers and hundreds of pilots in Oregon will go on strike at 4 a.m. according to the established plan. As a result, Northwest Airlines air transport across the American continent will be suspended.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 4th: New York: The New York press mostly holds a satirical attitude towards the results of the atomic bomb test on Bikini Atoll. The Herald Tribune said, "An atomic bomb cannot destroy an entire battle fleet in one fell swoop, only damage a coral reef and island, and turn the Pacific seawater into steam. People are no longer afraid of this latest gadget." Physicist Pollard criticized the Bikini test, saying, "Eighty percent of it is dramatic." He also denounced the government, saying this move was a "waste of money."

    【新华社延安四日电】纽约讯：纽约报界对此次比基尼岛原子弹试验结果，多抱讽刺态度。先驱论坛报称：“一枚原子弹不能一举摧毁整个作战舰队，仅破坏一个珊瑚丛及岛屿，使太平洋海水化为蒸气而已，人们对此最新之玩意儿已无所恐惧”。物理学家波拉德批评比基尼试验说：“其百分之八十是戏剧性的”。他并斥责政府，说此举为“浪费金钱”。
