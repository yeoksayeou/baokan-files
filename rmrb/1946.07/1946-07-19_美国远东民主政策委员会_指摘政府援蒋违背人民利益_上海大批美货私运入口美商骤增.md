Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Washington Dispatch: The Far East Democratic Policy Committee, composed of American experts on Far Eastern affairs, recently opposed the U.S. authorities' current aid to Chiang Kai-shek in expanding the civil war, and demanded that the U.S. military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill be decided after the situation in China is clarified. The committee strongly stated: "Before a democratic government is established in China, military assistance should not be given to China, because such military assistance will be used for civil war. This bill, which grants the U.S. President such huge authority in peacetime, contradicts the policy of the American people and undermines China's sovereignty. The Chinese people are dissatisfied with this assistance."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: New York Dispatch: The "Worker's Daily" recently published an editorial criticizing Deputy Secretary of State Acheson's recent explanation of U.S. policy toward China, stating: "It is indeed a fact that the Chiang Kai-shek regime is acting openly under the advice of warmongers. It is also not necessarily untrue that these warmongers are deliberately engaged in civil war, and these warmongers are still constantly receiving material assistance from the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Shanghai Dispatch: Local newspapers revealed that the U.S. ship "Jefferson Maya" was found to contain tax-evading smuggled goods late last month, and stated: "Some U.S. Navy personnel carrying smuggled goods and evading customs duties has become an open secret. The smuggled goods include large quantities of cigarettes, jeeps, machines, engines, etc., with a huge volume."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Shanghai Dispatch: Since the promulgation of the new Company Law, according to investigations, the number of American companies and firms that have opened branches in Shanghai has reached 115. Among them, 40 are branches established by American parent companies, and 75 are agencies established under commission. Most of them are engaged in import and export business.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: Shanghai Dispatch: Li Weiguang, Chairman of the Taiwan Fellow-Townsmen Association in Shanghai, recently exposed the ambition of American imperialism to covet Taiwan at the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Branch of the Fujian-Taiwan Construction Association, saying: "Recently, an article in the American 'Time' magazine stated that Taiwanese people like American rule, and if they were to vote freely, they would be willing to belong to the United States." Mr. Li expressed his indignation at this, believing that it was an insult to the Taiwanese people.
