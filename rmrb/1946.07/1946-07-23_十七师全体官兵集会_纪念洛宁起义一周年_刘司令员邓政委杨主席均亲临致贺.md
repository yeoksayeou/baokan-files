　　Seventeenth Division Holds Rally to Commemorate the First Anniversary of the Luoning Uprising

　　Commander Liu, Political Commissar Deng, and Chairman Yang Personally Attend to Offer Congratulations

　　[Handan, 19th dispatch] The officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army's 17th Division solemnly held a rally in a certain place in Handan on the 17th to commemorate the first anniversary of the division's "July 17th" Luoning Uprising. Liu, Commander of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region; Deng, Political Commissar; Bo Yibo, Speaker of the Border Region Council; Song Renqiong of the CCP Central Bureau; Yang, Chairman of the Border Region Government; Wang Dingnan, Director of the Democratic National Construction Army; Gao Zhengxia, Deputy Division Commander; and Wang Yuechen, Mayor of Handan, all went to offer their congratulations. The Seventeenth Division was established during the Xinhai Revolution and was founded by General Yang Hucheng. It made outstanding military achievements during the Northern Expedition, contributing to the Xi'an Incident, which promoted China's unity against Japan. The division was also one of the participants. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it fought successively in Baoding, Niangziguan, northwestern Shanxi, and the Zhongtiao Mountains, and defended the Guangwu and Yanshi areas on the south bank of the Yellow River for several years. However, Chiang Kai-shek, with his single-minded pursuit of dictatorial rule and exclusion of dissidents, not only did not reward this meritorious army but instead adopted a policy of weakening, dividing, and annexing it, forcing the Seventeenth Division to attack the Yu-Xi Eighth Route Army in an attempt to completely eliminate it in the anti-communist civil war. The officers and soldiers of the division could no longer tolerate this, and on July 17th of last year, in Guguxian Town, Luoning, Henan, they raised the banner of righteousness against the civil war. The venue was filled with banners reading "Commemorate 'July 17th' and promote the glorious revolutionary traditions of 'Double Twelfth' and 'July 17th'," "Resolutely oppose the civil war," and "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's fascist dictatorship policy of eliminating dissidents." The congratulatory message from Commander-in-Chief Gao of the Democratic National Construction Army read: "Persist in independence, peace, and democracy, and smash the new offensives of the Chiang-American reactionaries." After the joyful opening of the meeting, Zhang Junzhen, Commander of the Seventeenth Division, said excitedly: "'July 17th' is the anniversary of our entire division breaking away from Chiang Kai-shek's fascist rule and embarking on the bright road of revolution. Since the uprising, under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we have made great progress. Together with the military and civilians of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region, we have joined forces to counterattack the enemy and puppets, defend peace, liberate Yuancheng, capture 4,065 enemy and puppets, kill and wound 227, seize 4 mountain guns, 97 machine guns, 1,400 rifles, 75 warhorses, and destroy a train. In combat, the relationship between officers and soldiers and the relationship between the military and civilians have also been greatly improved." Commander Zhang resolutely stated in the end: "The entire division will continue to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition, serve the people wholeheartedly, and defend the border region." Commander Liu, in his warm congratulations, said very sadly: "Countless revolutionary martyrs have shed their blood and sacrificed themselves for China's independence and democracy, but China's independence and democracy have not yet been realized. Chiang Kai-shek is now doing the traitorous deeds that Yuan Shikai did not finish. The Seventeenth Division was a strong force in the revolutionary war during the Great Revolution. I hope that today it can better integrate with the people, break through the current dangerous situation, and add a more glorious page to its history by next 'July 17th'." Chairman Yang first represented the border region's governments at all levels and the 30 million people to congratulate all the officers and soldiers of the Seventeenth Division. He then reported the news that the two democratic fighters, Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, in Kunming, were assassinated by Kuomintang secret agents, and the audience was filled with righteous indignation, shouting slogans of "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent rule." Next, Deputy Division Commander Gao of the Democratic National Construction Army delivered a speech, saying that he had met many officers and soldiers of the Seventeenth Division during the Wuyuan Oath Ceremony, and he was very happy to see them all embark on the road of revolution today. Shu, a senior staff officer of the former 38th Army (under which the 17th Division was assigned), recently arrived from the Central Plains Military Region and rushed to participate in the grand ceremony. He congratulated everyone for preserving this team of northwestern people at the cost of sacrifice and bloodshed. He firmly opposed Chiang Kai-shek's reliance on the United States to wage a civil war, saying: "Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries are viciously encircling and suppressing the Central Plains Military Region, plotting to expand the civil war. We should be vigilant and prepare to use brotherly friendship to defeat the joint offensive of Chinese and foreign reactionaries together with the Eighth Route Army." The meeting passed a telegram to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and also telegraphed the people of the whole country to appeal for the defense of the motherland's independence, peace, and democracy, and resolutely oppose the civil war.

　　十七师全体官兵集会
    纪念洛宁起义一周年         
    刘司令员邓政委杨主席均亲临致贺
    【邯郸十九日电】国民革命军第十七师全体官兵于十七日在邯郸某地隆重举行该师“七一七”洛宁起义周年纪念。晋冀鲁豫军区刘司令员、邓政委，边区参议会薄一波议长，中共中央局宋任穷同志，边府杨主席，民主建国军王定南主任，高正夏副师长及邯市王悦尘市长等均亲往祝贺。十七师成立于辛亥革命时代，为杨虎城将军所手创，北伐时战勋卓著，促成中国统一抗日之西安事变，该师亦为参加者之一。抗战期间，先后转战于保定、娘子关、晋西北、中条山等地，并防守黄河南岸广武、偃师一线达数年之久。乃蒋介石一心独裁统治排斥异己，对此有功军队不惟不赏，反采取削弱分化并吞政策，逼令十七师进攻豫西八路军，以期在反共内战中将其全部消灭，该师官兵忍无可忍，乃于去年七月十七日，于河南洛宁故县镇，高举反内战义旗。会场四周，满布“纪念‘七一七’发扬‘双十二’‘七一七’的光荣革命传统”，“坚决反对内战”，“反对蒋介石消灭异己的法西斯独裁政策”的贺幛，民主建国军高总司令的贺词写着：“坚持独立和平民主，粉碎蒋美反动派联合的新进攻”，快乐开会后，十七师张俊振师长非常兴奋的说：“七一七”是我们全师脱离蒋介石法西斯统治，走向革命光明大道的纪念日。起义以来在毛主席朱总司令直接领导下取得伟大的进步，我们与晋冀鲁豫区军民，并力反攻敌伪保卫和平，解放了垣曲城，俘敌伪四千零六十五人，毙伤二百二十七人，缴山炮四门，机枪九十七挺，步枪一千四百支，战马七十五匹，打毁火车一列。在战斗中，部队官兵关系与军民关系亦获得极大的改进。张师长最后坚决表示：“全师今后要继续发扬光荣的革命传统，全心全意为人民服务，保卫边区。”刘司令员在热忱祝贺中，非常沉痛的说：“无数先烈已为中国的独立民主流血牺牲，但中国的独立民主仍未实现，蒋介石现正做着袁世凯没有做完的卖国勾当，十七师在大革命中，就是革命战争中一支劲旅，希望今天更能与人民结合，冲破目前险恶的局势，到明年‘七一七’时，把自己的历史增上更光辉的一页”。杨主席首先代表边区各级政府与三千万人民，向十七师全体官兵祝贺，继即报告昆明李公朴、闻一多两位民主战士被国民党特务狙击致死的消息，全场义愤填膺，高呼“反对蒋介石特务统治”的口号。接着民主建国军高副师长致词，他说当年五原誓师曾与十七师不少官兵相识，今天都走上革命大道，在此相见倍感亲切。前三十八军（辖十七师）高级参谋叔最近由中原军区抵此也赶来参与盛典，他庆贺大家不惜牺牲流血保存下西北人民这一支队伍。对目前蒋介石恃美内战，他坚决表示反对，他说：“蒋介石反动派正狠毒围歼中原军区，阴谋扩大内战，我们应警惕起来，准备以弟兄的友谊，与八路军一道来击败中外反动派的联合进攻”。会上通过致电向毛主席朱总司令致敬，并电全国人民呼吁保卫祖国独立和平民主，坚决反对内战。
