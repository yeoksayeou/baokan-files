　　Vow to Defend the Fruits of Victory
    Wu'an "July 7th" Review of Militiamen, Song Er Says: Whoever Dares to Attack, We Will Eliminate Them!
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] To commemorate the first "July 7th" after the victory against Japan, and to oppose the US imperialists' aiding of the Kuomintang reactionaries' internal war of aggression, all sectors here held a grand gathering of over 20,000 people on this day to publicly mourn the martyrs who died in the War of Resistance Against Japan, and to review 5,000 militiamen from the entire county. In the early morning, national flags fluttered throughout the city, but the jubilant mood of victory over Japan was replaced by unparalleled anger against new aggression and civil war today. Slogans and cartoons such as "Oppose the American imperialist policy of turning China into a colony" and "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the motherland and launching of a full-scale civil war" were plastered all over the streets, and children's Yangko teams sang songs demanding independence, peace, and democracy everywhere. Women and people from various villages and streets lined up, carrying sacrificial wreaths and offering solemn mourning music, continuously converging in front of the Martyrs' Tower to pay their respects, expressing the people's infinite grief and respect for the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country. After breakfast, the review and machine gun and rifle shooting performances were held in the shade of willow trees. When the solemn military music sounded, and the ranks of heroic and impassioned militiamen carrying guns and ammunition marched past the reviewing stand, it fully demonstrated the immense strength of the masses in the liberated areas after their liberation to defend their own interests. The conference began at 3:00 PM, with County Magistrate Cheng giving a speech first. After recounting the history of the people of Wu'an fighting against Japan and achieving liberation under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, he emphasized the crimes of the American imperialists attempting to turn China into a colony and Chiang Kai-shek colluding with American reactionaries to launch a full-scale civil war, arousing the roaring of thousands of people, which resounded throughout the venue! "Oppose the American imperialist elements!" "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's civil war!" Then he shouted loudly: "We, the people of Wu'an, must arm ourselves and resolutely defend the fruits of our war of resistance and liberation!" Subsequently, Political Commissar Cao gave a speech: after explaining the spirit of the CCP Central Committee's "July 7th" Declaration in detail, the roar of "Support the CCP Central Committee's July 7th Declaration!" "Support Chairman Mao's statement!" "Repel the attack of the Sino-American reactionaries!" from the audience continued for a long time. Guo Heng, the textile hero, climbed onto the podium and said loudly: "Militia comrades must practice martial arts well, and women and men must spin and weave and help each other well to support Chairman Mao's statement and the July 7th Declaration, and resolutely oppose the civil war." Song Er, a liberated hero and member of the Border Region Council, squeezed onto the podium and said: "Everyone knows that I used to be a tenant farmer and a beggar. Now I have mules and land. We cannot let the rice bowl we have in our hands be snatched away by a second Japan and a second Wang Jingwei. All of us in Wu'an must arm ourselves, and whoever dares to attack us, we will wipe them out!" After the conference resolved to send a telegram to the whole country to support Chairman Mao's statement and the CCP Central Committee's "July 7th" Declaration, a parade was held and the meeting adjourned.
