Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd. The remains of Comrade Guan Xiangying, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, were placed in a coffin at the Central Party School at 5:00 PM yesterday, and solemnly buried in the cemetery at the Dongguan outside the airfield at 8:00 AM today. During the entombment, Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Ren Bishi, Kang Sheng, Luo Ruiqing and others were present to view the remains. Immediately afterwards, the entire body of cadres and party members of the Central Organization Department and the Central Party School, as well as responsible comrades of the Central Committee, took turns guarding the coffin until this morning. At 6:00 AM today, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Comrade Ren Bishi and others carried the coffin onto the hearse, and together with Comrades Peng Dehuai, Kang Sheng, Lin Boqu, Lu Dingyi, Rao Shushi, Xu Xiangqian, Cai Chang, Xi Zhongxun, Ma Mingfang and other representatives from various organs and schools, more than 400 people escorted the remains. Ten mourning vehicles slowly followed, and along the way, various organs and the masses of Dongguan set up roadside memorial services to greet the passing hearse. When the hearse arrived at the cemetery, more than 5,000 representatives of the funeral procession and the people of Yan'an stood in solemn silence. Commander-in-Chief Zhu and others supported the coffin off the hearse. As mournful music began, everyone bowed three times to the portrait of the deceased. Commander-in-Chief Zhu then delivered a eulogy in front of the wreaths and elegiac couplets, saying sorrowfully, "Comrade Guan Xiangying devoted his life to doing much important work for the revolution. He demonstrated the heroic and steadfast qualities of a Bolshevik on the battlefield and in prison. Due to long-term struggle against the enemy, he became ill from overwork. Today he is dead, and the entire Party and army must inherit his legacy and fight to the end to complete the cause of national independence, peace and democracy!" At this time, Liang Fushou, the guard who had long protected Comrade Guan Xiangying, and Li Shui, the female doctor who cared for him during his illness of more than four years, were both weeping. After twelve artillery salutes, the burial took place amidst mournful music. Suddenly, an air raid siren sounded, followed by two Chiang Kai-shek planes intruding into the airspace above the cemetery, arousing the hatred of the funeral procession towards the Kuomintang reactionaries. Most people calmly and orderly dispersed to take cover, but Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Comrade Ren Bishi and others solemnly took up shovels and laid earth. The guard Liang Fushou cried as he grabbed handfuls of earth and threw them into the grave. More than ten comrades from the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the Central Party School also completed the earth-laying amidst air raid sirens. The funeral ceremony ended at 10:00 AM.

　　关向应同志隆重落葬
    朱总司令墓前悲痛致哀词
    号召全党全军继承向应同志遗志奋斗到底
    【新华社延安二十三日电】中共中央委员关向应同志遗体，于昨日下午五时在中央党校入殓，今日上午八时隆重安葬于东关外飞机场墓地。入殓时，刘少奇、任弼时、康生、罗瑞卿等同志均亲临视殓，随即由中央组织部，中央党校全体干部党员及中央负责同志轮流护灵，直至今晨。今日上午六时，朱总司令、任弼时同志等将灵柩抬上灵车，并与彭德怀、康生、林伯渠、陆定一、饶漱石、徐向前、蔡畅、习仲勋、马明芳等同志及各机关学校代表四百余人随灵护送。十辆护灵车徐徐跟进，沿途各机关及东关群众，设立迎灵路祭。灵车到达墓地时，送葬代表及延市群众五千余人，全体肃立，朱总司令等扶灵下车，哀乐声起，全体向遗像行三鞠躬礼，朱总司令即于墓前花圈挽联丛中致哀词，他悲痛地说：“关向应同志生平为革命做了很多重要工作，在战场上，在监狱中都表现了英勇坚定的布尔塞维克品质，由于长期的对敌人搏斗，以致辛劳成疾。今天他死了，全党全军要继承他的遗志，为完成中华民族独立和平民主事业而奋斗到底！”此时送葬行列中长期卫护关向应同志的警卫员梁甫绶及四年余病中护理他的女医生李水等，皆泣不成声。礼炮十二响后，即在凄惋的乐声中安葬。蓦然警报响起，随即有蒋机两架窜入墓地上空，引起了送葬人群对国民党反动派的痛恨，大都沉着而有秩序地散开隐蔽，但朱总司令、任弼时等同志肃然执铲奠土，警卫员梁甫绶哭着以手抓土，抛入墓穴。中共中央办公厅及中央党校十余同志亦在警卫声中紧张完成奠土。葬仪于上午十时完毕。
