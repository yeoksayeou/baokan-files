　　Tian Feng, at the Advanced Age of Sixty, Requests to Join the Party
    Approved by the CCP Central Committee
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th] The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on June 17th, approved the decision of the Central China Bureau to accept Comrade Tian Feng into the Communist Party of China and sent a telegram to Comrade Tian Feng. The original telegram is as follows:
    To the Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China, and to our dear Comrade Tian Feng: For forty years, you have consistently fought alongside the people for national liberation and the cause of people's liberation. Through your long experience, you have recognized the path for the Chinese people. At the advanced age of sixty-one, you have resolutely decided to join the revolutionary ranks of the Chinese proletariat. The CCP Central Committee approves the decision of the Central China Bureau to accept you into the Communist Party of China as a member and extends to you our respects and warm welcome! The CCP Central Committee, June 17th.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] Mr. Tian Feng, a respected elder of Huaibei and Speaker of the Provisional Assembly of the Suwan Border Region, requested to join the Communist Party of China on the 10th of this month at the advanced age of sixty. The Central China Bureau of the Communist Party of China accepted his request and telegraphed the CCP Central Committee for approval. The CCP Central Committee approved it on the 17th and sent a special telegram to Comrade Tian Feng. (The telegram is in the previous dispatch).
    According to reports, Comrade Tian Feng is from Anhui Province and is currently sixty-one years old. He comes from a military background. He joined the Tongmenghui at the age of twenty-one. He successively served as a staff officer and commander in the Sichuan Defense Army. During the Xinhai Revolution, he led his troops to participate in the Sichuan independence movement. When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, he went to the Northeast to organize an anti-Yuan movement. Later, he responded to the Yunnan Uprising in Tongzhou. Subsequently, he participated in the campaign against Zhang Xun. During the Northern Expedition, he founded the Farmers' Association in Wanbei ×× and served as its director. Later, he organized an anti-debt group to oppose usurious exploitation, which was envied by reactionary forces, leading to his exile in Wuyuan, Suiyuan, where he made a living by reclamation. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he returned to Wanbei to engage in local anti-Japanese work. In 1940, after meeting with the late Commander Peng Xuefeng of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army, he participated in the work of the liberated areas, successively serving as a member of the Yuwansu Defense Committee, a councilor of the Fourth Division of the New Fourth Army, and a resident member of the Huaibei Border Region Assembly. Last year, when the Suwan Border Region was established, he was elected as the Speaker of the Border Region Assembly. In his request to join the Party, Comrade Tian Feng wrote: "Based on decades of experience, I deeply believe that to achieve the success of the democratic revolution, it is only possible by relying on the people, mobilizing the people, and organizing the people, and using the strength of the people to strive for democracy and defend democracy. The organization and mobilization of the people's strength depend entirely on a political party that serves the people wholeheartedly. From my experience, only the Communist Party can shoulder this responsibility among the political parties in China. Therefore, I put forward a sincere and urgent request, asking to be allowed to join the Communist Party so that I can, under the correct leadership of the CCP headed by the people's leader Mao Zedong, do my best to work hard for the revolutionary cause and serve the masses of the Chinese people. As long as I have a breath left, I will definitely fight to the end."

    荣获中共中央批准
    【新华社延安二十九日电】中国共产党中央，于六月十七日，把准华中分局接受田丰同志加入中国共产党的决定，并电致田丰同志，原电如下：
    中共华中分局转亲爱的田丰同志：你四十年来，始终同人民一道为民族解放与人民解放事业奋斗不懈，在你长期的经历中，认清了中国人民的出路，以六十一岁的高龄决心加入中国无产阶级的革命队伍，中共中央批准华中分局接受你加入中国共产党为党员的决定，并向你致敬意与热烈的欢迎之忱！中共中央六月十七日。
    【新华社延安二十八日电】淮北耆宿、苏皖边区临时参议会议长田丰老先生，于本月十日，以花甲高年，请求加入中国共产党。中共华中分局予以接受，并电请中共中央批准。中共中央于十七日加以批准，并特电田丰同志。（该电见前一电讯）
    按田丰同志安徽人，现年六十一岁。出身行伍。二十一岁参加同盟会。历任四川防军参谋及统领等职。辛亥革命率部参加四川独立运动，袁世凯称帝时，曾至东北组织反袁运动，后在通州响应云南起义，继参加讨伐张勋，北伐即在皖北××创立农民协会任主任委员，后又组织抗债团，反对高利剥削，为反动势力所嫉忌，以致被迫流亡于绥远五原，以开垦为生。抗战爆发，回皖北从事地方抗日工作，一九四零年与新四军四师彭故师长雪枫会晤后，即参加解放区工作，先后任豫皖苏防委员会委员、新四军四师参议，淮北边区参议会驻会委员等职。去年苏皖边区成立，即被举为边区参议会议长。田丰同志在请求入党书中写道：“以数十年之体验，深信欲谋民主革命之成功，惟有依靠人民、发动人民、组织人民，以人民之力量争取民主，保卫民主，始克有济。而人民力量之组织与发动，端赖全心全意为人民之政党。依经历所见，在中国政党中只有共产党堪当此任，故提出真挚与迫切之要求，请准予参加共产党，以便能在以人民领袖毛泽东为首的中共正确领导下，竭尽驽钝，努力革命事业，为中国人民大众服务，一息尚存，誓必奋斗到底。”
