　　[This article comes from:] This Newspaper, Handan, 16th. The Jinnan Eighth Route Army has achieved brilliant results in disarming the Gaotang puppet troops. On the evening of the 12th of this month, Yunzhuang, an important town east of Gaotang City, was also captured by our army. The puppet army unit of Yun Mao-cai, which was entrenched in the town, was completely annihilated, with more than 400 people captured alive. Pang Chang-shen, Deng Xie-chen, and Yun Mao-cai, the puppet troops in Gaotang, were all well-known puppet troops in western Shandong. After the enemy surrendered, the Kuomintang reorganized them into Shandong Security Brigades and actively supported them, instructing them to launch frantic attacks on our liberated areas. The "Black Killing Corps" and "Plainclothes Teams" they organized frequently sneaked into the liberated areas to massacre peaceful people, causing terrible suffering to the local people. On the 6th of this month, at the request of the people, our army rose up to disarm them, capturing their outer strongholds such as Wulipu, Xuguantun, and Niuguantun. On the 8th, we took advantage of the victory to recover Nieji, Shitun, and Xulou. On the 9th, strongholds such as Sanguanmiao and Yangguantun were also captured by our army. On the 12th, Yunzhuang was captured. Now our army is besieging the stubbornly resisting Gaotang puppet troops.
　　[This article comes from:] This Newspaper, Handan, 18th. The Jinan Kuomintang 12th Army is actively assisting the Gaotang puppet troops who are being disarmed. On the 14th of this month, the entire 112th Division of the army, under the personal command of the army commander Huo Shouyi, cooperated with Li Lianxiang's puppet army in Qihe and Weizhaizi, totaling more than 4,000 people, and fiercely attacked Yangguantun and Sanguanmiao in the southeast of Gaotang in three routes. Two Kuomintang planes also took off to assist in the battle. Our local garrison resolutely resisted. After five hours of fierce fighting, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet allied forces suffered more than 500 casualties and fled back to their original locations in a panic.
