　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: According to Chongqing's National Evening News on June 30th: On the evening of the 28th, four American soldiers from U.S. Landing Craft No. 470 broke into the bathroom attached to the Huixianqiao Mansion Hotel in Chongqing. The hotel receptionist greeted them in English, but the four ignored him and rushed to the side of the women's bathroom door. The receptionist informed them that it was the "women's bathroom," but the four sailors still ignored him and rushed into the room. Women were bathing inside, and the sailors unreasonably dragged and insulted them in every way. This aroused public anger, and they were forcibly dragged outside and the police were urgently notified to stop them. However, the four sailors then returned with more than twenty others and destroyed the hotel.

　　美国文明到了重庆
    【新华社延安二十六日电】据六月三十日重庆国民晚报载：二十八日晚，有美国四七○号登陆艇美兵四人，闯至重庆会仙桥大厦旅社附设浴室，该旅社招待以英语招呼，四人不理，直冲女浴室门侧。该社招待员又告以内系“女浴室”，四水兵仍不理，径冲入室，室内妇女正在沐浴，该水兵等竟无理拖拉，百般侮辱。是时已激起众怒，将其强拖至门外，并急以电话告警局前往制止。但该四水兵旋又率同伍二十余人前来，将该旅社大肆捣毁。
