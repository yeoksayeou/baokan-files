(Our newspaper's Changzhi dispatch) The Yan Army is frantically seizing wheat in the area where the Tongpu and East Qin lines connect in Qi County. Within their controlled areas, wheat fields have been universally registered, and each *lv* (a traditional village unit) is ordered to concentrate threshing in one field, supervised by personnel dispatched by the village administration. For every two *liang* of silver, a temporary levy of three *shi* and five *dou* of grain is imposed, forcing immediate payment on the spot. Against our liberated area villages, they organize "Struggle Corps" to coordinate with the army in armed looting. They implement surrounding villages and capturing people, then forcing them to redeem themselves with grain. Recently, eleven people were taken from Zhongliang Village, each requiring five *shi* of wheat for their release. Captured cadres are killed, such as in Lu Village, where nine people including San Jia were buried alive. Li Shuncheng, a county council member of our Qi County, was also brutally murdered. The property looted in Daijiabao is also forcibly redeemed with grain. Our liberated area of the county has now organized joint defense. Militia grain-harvesting brigades have gone to the front to assist the troops in vigilance. The Yan army's several incursions have been repelled. This method of grain seizure by the Yan army is also extremely evident in Pingding. On the 14th and 15th, 54 men and women were seized from the villages of Xijia and Budaizhuang. Dozens of people were also seized in the area north of Xincun and nearby villages, forcing each person to redeem themselves with two *shi* of wheat. On the 15th, a farmer from Xijia was publicly and brutally killed with bayonets for failing to hand over wheat. Our local armed forces are now striking at this "hostage" policy of the Yan puppet army.

　　阎军抄袭日寇毒计
    以“人质”抢我麦收
    【本报长治讯】祁县同蒲、东沁两线接轨地区，阎军正疯狂抢麦。在其统治区内，麦田已普遍登记，并限令每闾集中一个场内晒打，由治村派员监视。每两粮银暂派征粮三石五斗，强迫当场完纳，对我解放区村庄则组织有“奋斗团”，配合军队武装抢掠。实行围村捉人，然后强迫以粮食回赎。最近中梁村被捉走十一人，每人要麦五石。捕捉到我干部，则予以杀害，如鲁村，三贾就被活埋九人。我祁县县议员李顺成亦被残害。在戴家堡所掠财物，亦强迫以粮食回赎。该县我解放区现已组织联防，民兵抢收大队，已开赴前方协助部队警戒，阎军几次出犯均被击退，阎军此种抢掠粮食的办法，在平定方面亦极为明显，十四、五两日在西贾与布袋庄两村，即抓去男女五十四人，在新村北数村一带亦抓走数十人，强迫每人以二石麦子回赎。十五日并将西贾一农民以不交麦为罪名，当众用刺刀惨杀，现我当地地方武装给予阎伪军此种“人质”政策以打击。
