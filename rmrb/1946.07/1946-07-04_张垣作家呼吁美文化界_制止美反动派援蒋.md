Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 1st. Chinese prominent writers Ding Ling, Xiao San, Cheng Fangwu, and others, in order to protest against the American reactionaries' military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial government, and to call on American friends to stand up and stop the American reactionaries' imperialist policy, sent a telegram on the 28th of last month to American cultural figures Sinclair, Pearl Buck, Hughes, Gold, Sledley, Snow, Atkinson, and Forman, and requested them to forward it to American cultural, literary, artistic, and journalistic circles, stating:

We, the writers of Zhangjiakou, a liberated city in China, urgently appeal to you—good friends of the Chinese people—to stand up and stop the American reactionaries' atrocities of helping the Chinese reactionaries slaughter the Chinese people. The United States supplies Chiang Kai-shek's government with military supplies, and the troops stationed in China help Chiang Kai-shek carry out civil war. Recently, the U.S. Secretary of State proposed a military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill, announcing the continuation of military aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government, which persists in civil war and dictatorship. This greatly encourages Chinese warmongers, causing them to break out into a comprehensive and long-term civil war. The Chinese people, after defeating the Japanese slave owners, are determined not to be anyone's slaves again. The American reactionaries intentionally want to turn China into an American colony or protectorate, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate and must resolutely oppose with their lives. For the sake of peace and democracy in China and the United States, as well as the whole world, for the sake of the traditional friendship between the people of China and the United States, and for the sake of enhancing cultural exchanges between China and the United States, we ask you to speak fairly and call on the broad masses of the American people and peace-loving and democratic people to unite to oppose the military aid to Chiang Kai-shek bill, withdraw all American military aid to Chiang Kai-shek, stop the American reactionaries' interference in China's internal affairs, and immediately withdraw the American troops stationed in China.

　　张垣作家呼吁美文化界
    制止美反动派援蒋
    【新华社张家口一日电】中国著名作家丁玲、萧三、成仿吾等，为抗议美国反动分子军事援助蒋介石独裁政府，并呼吁美国友人起来制止美国反动派的帝国主义政策，上月廿八日致电美文化界辛克莱、赛珍珠、休士、果尔德、斯莱德利、斯诺、爱金生、福尔曼，并请转美国文化界、文学界、艺术界、新闻界人士称：
    我们中国解放城市——张家口作家，向你们紧急呼吁请你们——中国人民的好朋友，起来制止美国反动分子帮助中国反动派屠杀中国人民的暴行：美国供给蒋介石政府军火，驻华军队帮助蒋介石进行内战。最近美国国务卿又提出军事援蒋法案，宣布继续以军火援助坚持内战与独裁的蒋介石政府，这更加大大的鼓励着中国好战分子，使其爆发全面的和长期的内战。中国人民在打退了日本奴隶主之后，决不愿再作任何人的奴隶，美国反动分子有意要使中国变为美国殖民地或保护国，中国人民决不能忍受，一定要誓死反对。为了中美两国以及全世界的和平与民主，为了中美两国人民传统的友谊，为了中美两国文化交流的增进，我们要求你们说公道话，号召美国广大人民和爱好和平民主的人士，一致起来反对军事援蒋法案，收回美国对蒋介石的一切军事援助，制止美国反动分子对中国内政的干涉，立即撤回驻华美军。
