Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 25th:
    Associated Press, Washington: US Senator Pepper told reporters that he did not want to vote in favor of the military aid to China bill (Representatives Boudreau and others expressed their opposition when the bill was passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on June 26). If the equipment provided under the bill were used to conduct a civil war to destroy anti-government forces. Pepper said he favored enacting legislation giving Marshall discretionary power over whether to use the equipment. In the House of Representatives, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom (Democrat) reported in favor of the bill, saying he would do his best to get the Rules Committee (equivalent to the proposal review committee in a general meeting; if the committee disagrees, the bill cannot be submitted to the general assembly for discussion; the chairman of the committee is Representative Sabath, a Democrat who initiated the "Congressional Conference for Peace" and a supporter of the New Deal) to pass the bill, but other leaders said there was little hope of passing the bill at this meeting. In the Senate, the bill has now been submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee, and there is no evidence of any intention to pass the bill quickly. Note: Mr. Pepper is a Senator from Florida, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the President of the American Bar Association. Mr. Pepper is an ardent supporter of the late President Roosevelt's international cooperation policy and actively supported all of President Roosevelt's legislation to promote America's war efforts and help the United Nations create lasting peace. Domestically, Mr. Pepper is a supporter of the New Deal.

　　美参议员泼贝尔  反对军事援蒋法案
    【新华社延安二十五日电】美联社华府讯：美参议员泼贝尔告记者称：他不想对军事援华法案（该案于上月二十六日在众院外委会上通过时，众议员波尔多等二人曾表示反对）投赞成票，如果根据该法案所能供应的装备用作进行内战，以摧毁反政府势力的话。泼贝尔说：可是他赞成制定立法，予马歇尔在是否使用装备一点上以斟酌裁夺之权。在众院，外议会主席白鲁姆（民主党员）曾对该案作表示赞成之报告，据他说：他将竭力使规程委员会（约等于一般会议中之提案审查委员会，如该会不同意，则议案不能提交大会讨论，该会主席为发起“国会争取和平会议”之民主党众议员萨巴兹，萨氏为拥护新政人物）审查通过该法案，但其他领袖则表示在此次会上，通过该法案之希望甚微。在参院，该案现已提交外交委员会，现尚无任何证据，证明有迅速通过该案之意。按：泼贝尔氏为美国法罗里达州参议员，参院外委会的委员，美国律师公会的主席。泼氏为故罗斯福总统国际合作政策的热烈拥护者，曾积极支持罗斯福总统关于促进美国作战努力援助联合国缔造永久和平之一切立法案。在内政方面，泼氏为新政的拥护者。
