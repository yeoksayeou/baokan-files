Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 1st: A CCP spokesperson recently issued a statement regarding the statement made by US Acting Secretary of State Acheson on June 28th, stating that Acheson attempted to defend the US government's policy towards China and the recent proposals of the US State Department, but his defense does not align with the facts. Acheson stated that the US so-called aid plan for China had been "agreed upon long ago." We do not know what he is referring to because not only has the Chinese Communist Party never received any plan proposed by the US government, but the Chiang Kai-shek government has never disclosed such plans to the people. Acheson strongly claimed that this plan "cannot be interpreted as supporting any military clique of any party in China," and its purpose is only to assist China in achieving peace, unity, and reconstruction, and claimed that if the United States does not begin its assistance before the establishment of a united government in China, then China "may face an economic collapse and plunge the general population of China into dire straits." However, facts are more important than any beautiful words. In fact, the world knows that the US government only supports the warlord group of the fascist faction within the Chinese Kuomintang, the "evil government" described by Time magazine as "corrupt, unreasonable, and maintaining power by force." Therefore, all the so-called "aid to China" by the US government is merely anti-China or an invasion of China. Contrary to Acheson's propaganda, this policy of the US government only encourages Chiang Kai-shek's "evil government" to openly resort to force, openly reject the Political Consultative Conference, and openly demand the abandonment of the military reorganization plan in order to retain its massive warlord army and the dictatorial system controlled by this army. If the United States truly wants China's peaceful unification and reconstruction, it should stop rather than continue the so-called "military aid to China," because China today does not need war at home or abroad, and China's military reorganization absolutely does not need American killing weapons and the direction of American killing art. Without the American so-called "military aid to China," China will certainly be able to achieve peace, reorganize its military, and rebuild. With the American so-called "military aid to China," China will certainly not be able to achieve peace, reorganize its military, heal the wounds of war, and avoid national economic and people's livelihood disasters. However, the US government authorities, based on their so-called "national interests," insist on pouring gasoline on China's flames, using guns and cannons and military advisory groups to create China's peace, unconditionally supporting Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war to achieve China's unity and democracy, and forcing the Chinese people to die in large numbers amidst war, terror, and hunger to seek China's friendship. The people of China and the United States were originally very friendly. Today, the Chinese people hope to develop economic relations between the two countries based on the principle of mutual benefit, but the US government's so-called "aid to China" has aroused widespread resentment among the Chinese people, causing the United States to lose friendship and credibility in China. Many Americans have already noticed this situation and demanded that the US government quickly change its policy. Undoubtedly, they know the truth better than Acheson.

　　阿泽逊掩饰美对华错误政策
    中共发言人予以批驳
    指出美国军事援华乃是反华或侵华
    只是鼓励蒋介石破坏中国和平民主
    【新华社延安一日电】中共发言人顷就美代理国务卿阿泽逊六月二十八日声明发表言论称：阿泽逊氏试图辩护美国政府的对华政策和美国国务院的最近提案，但他的辩护与事实不相符合。阿氏说：美国所谓援华计划“早经同意”，我们不知其为何指，因为不但中国共产党从未接到过美国政府所提出的何项计划，即蒋介石政府也从未向人民泄露过这类计划。阿氏力称该项计划“不能解释为支持中国任何党派之军事集团”，其目的只是协助中国获得和平、统一与再建，并称美国如不在中国联合政府成立以前即开始其援助，则中国“或将招致经济崩溃的危机，而陷中国一般人民于水深火热之中”。但是事实比任何美丽的言词更重要，在事实上，世人都知道，美国政府仅仅支持着中国国民党内法西斯派的军阀集团，即时代杂志所谓“贪污不合理和以武力维持政权”的“恶政府”，因此美国政府的一切所谓“援华”，仅仅是反华或侵华而已。与阿氏的宣传完全相反，美国政府的这种政策，只是鼓励了蒋介石的“恶政府”公开诉诸武力，公开拒绝政治协商会议，公开要求废弃整军方案，借以保留其庞大的军阀军队，与在此军队操纵下的独裁制度。美国如果真正要求中国的和平统一与再建，就应当停止而不是继续所谓“军事援华”，因为中国今天对内对外都不需要战争，中国的整军也绝对不需要美国的杀人武器和美国杀人艺术的导演，没有美国的所谓“军事援华”，中国就一定能够和平，能够整军，能够再建；有了美国的所谓“军事援华”，中国就一定不能和平，不能整军，不能医治战争的创伤，不能免于国家经济和人民生活的灾难。但是，美国政府当局根据其所谓“国家利益”，却坚持以汽油泼中国的火焰，以枪炮和军事顾问团来制造中国的和平，以无条件拥护蒋介石的独裁内战来实现中国的团结民主以强迫中国人民在战争恐怖和饥饿中大量死亡来寻求中国的友谊。中美两国人民本来很亲睦，今天中国人民，其希望在两利的原则下，发展两国经济关系，但是美国政府的所谓“援华”，却引起中国人民的普遍反感，使美国在中国丧失友谊与信誉，很多美国人士已经注意到这种情势，要求美国政府迅速改变政策，无疑的，他们比阿泽逊是更知道真理。
