Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th -- Liang Shuming, a Standing Committee member of the China Democratic League, recently issued a statement regarding the assassinations of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, saying: In the current political struggle, they were indeed killed by Kuomintang secret agents. He said: "When the assassination of Li Gongpu occurred, some people in society may not have fully believed that he would be sacrificed, but now that the assassination of Wen Yiduo has happened one after another, I am afraid anyone can understand. Mr. Li was an executive member of the China Democratic League and deputy director of the Democratic Education Movement Committee, and Mr. Wen was also an executive member of the China Democratic League and a standing committee member and director of the Propaganda Department of the Yunnan branch. Both were standing at the forefront of the democratic camp. May I ask, what is this if not a political struggle? Even on the Kuomintang side, there is no excuse to exonerate themselves. If they deny or shirk responsibility, they will only become a laughingstock."

Liang continued: "When the Li case occurred, we said that we would only appeal to society and not protest to the government; now that the Wen case has happened one after another, we believe that we must protest to the government. We protest whether the government allows the people to have the freedom of political activities within the political orbit."

Liang said indignantly: "Mr. Li and Mr. Wen were both men of letters and scholars, unarmed. Apart from appealing through speech, they had no other actions. If such people are to be completely exterminated, please put away the talk of democracy and constitutionalism as soon as possible. Don't say it again, and don't use it to deceive the people! If you still intend to implement constitutionalism, then how can you not guarantee legitimate political activities? If you can't guarantee it, why occupy the position of the government? If you admit that you are still implementing constitutionalism and admit that you still have the responsibility to guarantee it, then take responsibility for the immediate events. We want to see the government's sincerity from the immediate events. On the one hand, we want to see whether the government is responsible from the immediate events, and on the other hand, we must urge it to abolish such special agent organs."

Liang condemned: "The government keeps saying that it wants all parties to participate in the government, but at the same time, it uses special agent organs to monitor us and threaten us. How can we participate? At this point, Liang warned the Kuomintang authorities, stating: If the special agent organs are not abolished, the China Democratic League will never participate in the government.

Finally, Liang said that he personally wanted to withdraw from practical politics and devote himself to cultural work, but as it is today, he cannot withdraw. "I cannot avoid this bullet. I will shout "Abolish the special agents" a hundred times. We want to see if the Kuomintang special agents can kill all the people who demand democracy. I am waiting for them here!"

　　民盟梁＠溟氏发表谈话
    抗议国民党暗杀闻李二氏     
    特务机关不取消民盟断不参加政府
    【新华社南京二十日电】民主同盟中常委梁ｓｈù＠①溟氏，顷为李公仆、闻一多暗杀案发表谈话称：在当前政治斗争上，的确他们是被国民党特务杀了的。他说：“当李公朴暗杀案发生时，社会上或者还有些人不完全相信他会牺牲，现在闻一多暗杀案继之再发生，恐怕任何人也都可以明白了。李先生是民主同盟中执委兼民主教育运动委员会副主委，闻先生亦为民主同盟中执委兼云南支部常委暨宣传部主任，两位都是站在民主阵线最前面的，试问这不是政治上的斗争是什么呢？即使在国民党方面，亦无词自释，如若有抵赖推脱，亦适成笑话而已。梁氏继称：在李案发生时，我们曾说过只向社会申诉，不向政府抗议的话；现在闻案继之再发生，我们认为非向政府抗议不可了。我们抗议政府允许不允许人民在政治轨道内有其政治活动之自由？梁氏愤慨的说：“李、闻两先生都是文人学者，手无寸铁，除以言论号召外，无其他行动，假如这样的人都要斩净杀绝，就请早收起民主宪政的话，不要再说，不要再以此欺骗国人！如其还有意实施宪政，那么对于合法的政治活动如何不予保障？假如保障不了，何必高据政府之位？如其承认还实行宪政，并承认还要负保障之责，那就从眼前的事来负责起。我们要从眼前的事情上来看政府的诚意，一方面要从眼前的事情上看政府负责不负责，另方面还要督促他取消这种特务机关。梁氏谴责说：“政府口口声声要各党派参加到政府里来，但同时却拿特务机关监视我们，威胁我们，试问我们怎么能参加呢？至此，梁氏正告国民党当局称：特务机关不取消，民主同盟断不参加政府。最后梁氏表示，我个人本想要退出现实政治，致力文化工作，但是像今天这样，我却无法退出，我不能躲避这颗枪弹，我连喊一百声“取消特务”，我们要看看国民党特务能不能把要求民主的人都杀完，我在这里等待着他！
