　　A Letter Sent from Afar
    To Brother Shanben

    Dear Brother Shanben: After reading the July 4th Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Yan'an, we, your younger brothers, were so excited to learn that you and ten air force friends flew to Yan'an to oppose the civil war!

    I remember when you left our hometown to go to aviation school in 1935, we asked you why you didn't go to university? You said, "The country is in deep trouble now, I'm learning to fly to fight Japan." Soon, the sacred War of Resistance began. During this period, although we were far apart, we all participated in the War of Resistance and won the victory of the motherland's resistance. But now, the Kuomintang reactionaries collude with the American reactionaries to launch a civil war, slaughtering their compatriots, and not allowing the people to live in peace. On June 23rd, we personally experienced the bombing and strafing by Kuomintang planes in Boshan City. At that time, we were thinking: Could it be that our Brother Shanben is flying American planes, using American armor-piercing bullets to strafe peaceful compatriots, and using huge bombs to destroy locomotives?! Your actions prove that we guessed right. Brother! Your righteous and heroic actions have dealt a severe blow to the reactionaries, and are a resounding call to the vast number of people with national consciousness, and to the officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, navy, and air force, and a powerful encouragement to them to resolutely withdraw from the civil war vortex. Brother Shanben! You are a good son of the nation, a good son of our clan, and our good brother. We feel supremely honored.

    Due to the eight years of destruction by the enemy and puppets, our home has been destroyed, but under the full-scale construction of the democratic government, the situation has been improving day by day. Our uncles are healthy, and their lives are assisted by the democratic government and our close care. Please don't worry. Brother Shanben! Let us work together for the independence, peace, and democratic cause of our motherland! We are determined that victory will surely belong to us. Your younger brothers, Liu Shanxin and Liu Tianying, from our hometown in Anqiu.

　　遥寄
    给善本哥的信
    亲爱的善本哥哥：读到七月四日延安新华社电讯，您为反对内战与十位空军朋友驾机赴延消息后，作为您的弟弟的我们是如何兴奋啊！
    记得民国二十四年您离乡去航空学校时，我们问你为什么不上大学？您说：“现在国难深重，学飞行打日本。”不久神圣的抗战开始了。这期间我们虽天各一方，但却都参加了抗战，而且获得了祖国抗战的胜利。可是现在国民党反动派与美国反动派互相勾结，发动内战，屠杀自己同胞，不让老百姓过太平的日子。六月二十三日，我们在博山城亲身经受了国民党飞机的轰炸和扫射，那时我们想着：驾了美国飞机，用美国穿甲弹扫射过着和平生活的同胞，用巨型炸弹炸毁火车头的该不会有我们的善本哥哥吧？！以您的行动证明，我们猜对了。哥哥！您那正义的英勇的行动，给予反动派以严重的打击，对于广大具有民族意识的，国民党军内的，海陆空军官兵是一个响亮的号召，有力的鼓励他们也能决然退出内战漩涡。善本哥哥！您是民族的好儿子，也是我们族中的好子弟，是我们的好哥哥，我们感到无上的光荣。
    由于敌伪八年的摧残，我们的家是被毁了，但在民主政府的全力建设下光景已日益改善，伯叔健在，生活有民主政府帮助和我们就近照顾，请勿远念。善本哥哥！让我们为祖国的独立，和平，民主事业携手共同奋斗吧！我们有决心，胜利一定是属于我们的。您的弟弟刘善新，刘天楹于安邱家乡。
