　　A World of Ghosts and Demons
　　Xu Jingfan
　　Today, after victory! The demonic shadows of oppression, humiliation, harm, and terror still tightly grip people's hearts! The footprints of these demonic shadows are tracking people's paths, threatening their lives! The giant hands of these demonic shadows are seizing the people's freedom!
            Absurd Freedom
　　During a lively day of the Spring Festival, the square outside Xiaodongmen, usually crowded with horse-drawn carriages, was filled with people, and horse-drawn carriages were rare.
　　In the crowd, a carriage had just been fitted with a yoke and was about to depart when it was stopped by an officer of the parachute troops.
　　At this time, the passengers in the carriage were already squeezed together knee-to-knee, but the officer paid no attention and ordered the two women beside him to get on the carriage. They not only took the coachman's seat, but one of the women practically had half her buttocks sitting on someone else.
　　The horse, already weakened by overwork, could not withstand the sudden heavy pressure. Its back softened, and its front knees buckled.
　　Although the coachman repeatedly explained that the carriage could not handle more load, the officer's reasons were a string of:
　　"If they can sit, why can't I?"
　　"Damn it, won't I pay?"
　　"Not moving? No one's going anywhere!"
　　Because of this tyranny, one of the passengers spoke up:
　　"You can't stop us all from leaving!"
　　"What?" the officer suddenly became angry;
　　"Are you trying to interfere with my freedom?!"
　　So the carriage fell silent. The coachman's face was full of bitter smiles and doubt, and he immediately steered the horse onto the diversionary road.
            Prestige and Molestation
　　The diversionary road is about ten kilometers long, with three villages in the middle; once traveled by buses. But since the Hongxiang troops stationed in the villages exercised this "freedom," only horse-drawn carriages have been left to maintain transportation.
　　There are many reasons why the buses stopped running. But the main reason was due to the prestige of these paratroopers. "To display the prestige of heavenly soldiers and generals," this was their slogan.
　　It was a Sunday when a bus drove into the city from the suburbs. When passing the Jiangtou Village station, the bus was covered with "heavenly soldiers." Although the driver protested, he could not interfere with their "freedom" and got nowhere.
　　After the bus started, the "heavenly soldiers" not only didn't buy tickets but also took full advantage of the female ticket seller; squeezed into that jar-like carriage, the female ticket seller suffered all kinds of touching and pinching insults.
　　After passing the village, a ticket inspector squeezed onto the bus to perform his duties. But a dispute immediately broke out. The ticket inspector was pressed to the ground by many armed fists. The carriage was in turmoil, and at this moment, the bus rolled into a gully.
　　Since then, it has become even more difficult for people to enter the city. They have to endure one or two hours of jostling on the slow horse-drawn carriages.
            Hitchhiking Techniques
　　But being able to smoothly overcome the jostling is still fortunate. Often, when horse-drawn carriages pass through villages with stationed troops, people are subjected to unreasonable inspections. Sometimes, even cars have to stop in front of those American-style submachine guns. If you ask:
　　"What are you checking?"
　　"Just looking."
　　They originally had no right to carry out this task, so they could only vaguely answer "just looking." In reality, they don't even look, but while saying they are looking, groups of "heavenly soldiers and generals" swarm onto the carriage. And you can't stop them, otherwise, they will sternly question you:
　　"What are you doing?"
　　Even worse than this, before the horse-drawn carriage reaches its final destination, people are driven off by the "heavenly soldiers." They don't care whether you live or die, they force the carriage to run back.
            Slip Away
　　Even so, you can still see those skinny livestock coming and going on the rugged mountain road morning and evening. But lately, at dusk, the horse-drawn carriages no longer run. Because they are afraid of losing money, especially afraid of getting beaten. Because in the dim light, on the mountain road where the sky is about to darken, these "heavenly soldiers" still want to show off their prestige when taking the carriage. They often don't pay and slip away in a puff of smoke. Sometimes they force the carriage to carry rice, but the fare is "freely" given, however much they want. Any resistance is met with a fist in the chest. They even dismiss the coachman and drive the carriage away themselves.
            Big Shots Filling Empty Shells
　　Residents around the village cannot complain about transportation difficulties. At the same time, they feel that trouble has seeped into their lives, and because of this boundless trouble, they cannot have peace day or night.
　　Those who run shops, even small businesses, are forced to extend credit to those stationed troops. When they walk into a restaurant, the air they put on while being seated is more than enough to make them seem like customers. But these customers always put a bill on account, more or less, before leaving. Once something is on account, it is like an iron ring clasped around an iron ring, firm and enduring. If you say no credit, the food has already gone into their stomachs, what can you do? Besides, whose eyes are like X-rays? Who has the ability to see through the situation in the customers' pockets?!
            Empty-Handed Magic
　　For this reason, eyes are not X-rays and cannot see what others are thinking. So it has become common for villagers to see things disappear. Those factories near the villages are the best places to practice effortless theft.
　　Because the countryside is vast and sparsely populated, a car repair shop, during a period of shutdown, had all the beds, tables, and equipment in the workers' dormitories cut away. Later, armed "heavenly soldiers" went to the factory to perform empty-handed magic. After being discovered, they left unhappily. But that night, the pile of wood still disappeared without a trace.
            A Bloody Live Target
　　That the "heavenly soldiers" are skilled at parachuting and possess such abilities is already alarming, but what is even more frightening is their "raid"—a raiding squad of the Hongxiang troops.
　　They are most fond of raiding live targets. Anytime, anywhere, bullets from pistols and rifles will whistle behind people's backs, fly over people's heads, and birds in trees and dogs on the ground are common targets. Since the target of a dog is larger than that of a bird, the fate of dogs in the village is even more tragic. Dog meat is often regarded as a delicacy and served on the table. Even those that can escape are either shot and covered in blood, or dare not go out to find food.
            Harm and Humiliation
　　They not only use this raiding on animals but also on people. Especially women. However, the weapons are different; one is bullets, the other is obscene language, teasing, and vulgar insults.
　　If women and girls pass through the village and are discovered by these raiding soldiers, you will first hear a burst of ghostly screams, followed by:
　　"Her breasts are wonderfully big!";
　　"Her ass swings nicely!";
　　"Hey! Which hotel are you opening?";
　　"………………"
　　At the same time, shovelfuls of mud and ash are thrown at the women's bodies and feet.
            Domestically Produced Japanese Bandits
　　Moreover, this raiding sometimes extends to people's homes.
　　One day, there were no men at the Zhou family's home in the village. At noon, two raiding soldiers suddenly broke in. They entered through the back door and exited through the front door. Passing through the courtyard, their leather boots stomped with a deafening sound. The children were so frightened that they cried at their menacing appearance.
　　A Guangdong woman who had lived in Hong Kong said that only the Japanese devils did this kind of free entry into people's homes when Hong Kong fell. Unexpectedly, the situation is the same in places without enemies.
            Terrifying Raid
　　The day before this, a newly married couple named Tian in Shangzhuang Village suffered an even more terrifying raid.
　　It was a deep night, and the man suddenly noticed figures moving outside the window. Just as he was about to speak, the door was kicked open violently by three raiding soldiers. Immediately, he and his wife were tied up back-to-back. The man suffered a "punishment," and before leaving, their door was locked from the outside.
　　Afterward, the couple could not figure out what had happened. They did not know what they had done to deserve such persecution. However, he remembered one thing: during the day, he had argued with them because his wife had been bullied. So in the middle of the night, they suffered this terrifying "raid." And they were forced to move away.
            What kind of world is this!
　　The demonic shadows of oppression, humiliation, harm, and terror still tightly grip people's hearts! The footprints of these demonic shadows are tracking people's paths, threatening their lives! The giant hands of these demonic shadows are seizing the people's freedom, blocking the sunlight in the clear sky!
　　Today, after victory, Kunming is still a world of ghosts and demons!

### 鬼魅的世界

　　鬼魅的世界
　　徐静凡
    胜利后的今日！欺压、侮辱、损害、恐怖的魔影，还在紧压着人们的心！魔影的足迹在追踪着人们的路子，威胁着人们的生活！魔影的巨掌在攫夺着人民的自由！
            荒谬的自由
    春节期间一个热闹的日子，小东门外平时广集着马车的广场上，这时只见是人，而稀见马车。
    人群里，一辆车刚套完了车轭，正欲起行，被走前来一个伞兵部队的军官喝住了。
    这时，车子里的坐客已经挤得促膝在一堆，但军官并不理会，就吩咐他身旁的二个女人登车。她们不但占去了车夫的座子，另一个女人简直就有半个屁股坐在别人的身上。
    劳动过度的马原就够衰弱，这时经不起突然的重压，腰干一软，前膝就跪了下去。
    车夫虽然再三诉说着马车的能力，无法增多负荷。但军官的理由却是一连串的：
    “他们坐，我不能坐？”
    “妈的，我不给钱？”
    “不走？大家走不成！”
    由于这种横蛮，坐客之一开腔了：
    “你不能也叫我们走不成呀！”
    “什么？”军官顿然恼怒了；
    “你能干涉我的自由吗？！”
    于是车斗里沉默了。马车夫的脸上堆满了苦笑和疑惑，随即把马吆上了疏散道。
            威风和吃豆腐
    疏散道长约十公里，中间有三个村子；曾经行驶过公共汽车。但自从驻村的鸿翔部队运用了这种“自由”以后，现在就只剩了马车在维持着交通。
    公共汽车停驶的原因很多。但主要的原因还是由于这般伞兵的威风所致。“要发挥天兵神将的威风”，这是他们的口号。
    那是一个星期天，公共汽车自郊外驶进城去。经过江头村站时，车子浑身都粘满了“天兵”。虽然经过司机抗议，但终因无法干涉他们的“自由”，不得要领。
    车子开动后，“天兵”们不但不购票，并且吃尽了“豆腐”；被挤在那罐子似的车厢里，女售票员备尝了摸、捏的侮辱。
    过了村子，查票员挤上车来执行任务。但争执随即发生了。查票员被众多的武装拳头压在底下。车厢里骚乱了，就在此时，汽车向山沟里滚了下去。
    从此，人们进城就更难苦了。他们得在那缓慢的马车上熬过一二小时的颠踬。
            搭车术
    但能顺利揆过颠踬的还是幸运。往往马车经过驻军的村子时，人们要受到无理检查。有时候，汽车也不得不在那美国式的冲锋枪跟前留步。万一你问：
    “查什么？”
    “看看。”
    他们原没有执行这项任务的权利，所以也只能含糊其词地回答说“看看”。实际上又并不看，却在说看的时候，成群的“天兵神将”就拥上了车。而且还不能阻止，否则他们会厉声的质问你：
    “干什么？”
    然更甚于此者，马车尚未抵达终站，人们就被“天兵”们赶下来，管你死活，他们就逼车子往回跑。
            溜之大吉
    虽然如此，崎岖的山道上早晚还能看到那些瘦骨棱峋的牲口来往。可是近来，天色薄暮，马车就不拉了。因为他们怕亏本，尤怕挨揍。因为在暮色苍茫，天光将尽的山道上，这些“天兵”们坐车还要摆威风。时常不付钱，就一溜烟地溜跑了。有时强迫载米，车资却“自由”给多少。稍有违抗，即老拳填胸。甚至撤了车夫，竟自吆车而去。
            充壳子的阔老
    村子周围的居民，不能以交通困难而怨艾，同时更感觉得生活里渗进了烦恼，由于这种无边的烦恼，白天黑夜都不得安宁。
    开铺子的，那怕是小本经营，也都给那些驻军硬搞上一篇拖欠。当他们走进馆子，那付看座儿的气派，就十足够得上是吃客。可是这些吃客临走，多多少少总是要给挂上账。这一挂，就好比铁圈扣住了铁环，坚固而经久不脱。若说不挂，东西早已进了肚，你有可奈何？何况谁的眼睛能像Ｘ光呢？谁有本领先透视出吃客们荷包里的情况呢？！
            空手妙术
    正因此，眼睛不是Ｘ光，也无法透视出别人的心里在想什么。所以村民们不见东西就成了常事。那些村子邻近的工厂，则更是顺手牵羊的最好场所。
    因为乡间地旷人稀，一家汽车修理厂于停工期间，工人宿舍里的床桌设备全被砍走了。之后武装的“天兵”又去厂里施行空手妙术，经人发现遂怏怏而去。可是当晚，那堆木料还是不翼而飞了。
            血淋淋的活靶
    “天兵”们除了会跳伞兼有如此的本领，已够人心惊，但还要叫人胆怕的，却是他们的“突击”——鸿翔部队一名突击总队。
    他们最嗜好突击活靶。随时随地，手枪、步枪的子弹会在人的背后呼啸，从人的头顶飞过，树上的鸟，地上的狗，则是活靶的普遍对象。狗的目标究竟较鸟为大，所以村子里狗的命运也更悲惨。狗肉时常被视为上品而端上桌面。纵或能够逃脱的，不是被射击得血淋带地，就是不敢出外觅食。
            损害与辱侮
    这种突击，他们不仅用于禽兽，且施于人。尤其是女人。不过武器不同；一是枪弹，一是猥亵的言语的调戏和下流的侮辱。
    假使妇人姑娘们经过村子，而被这里突击兵发现，于是你先会听一阵鬼喊，继着：
    “奶子大得妙哇”；
    “屁股摆得好”；
    “喂！开那家旅馆？”
    “……………………”
    同时，一铲铲的泥灰就向那些女人身上脚上洒去。
            国产的日寇
    并且，这种突击有时还突击到人们的家里去。
    一日，村民周姓的家里没有男人。中午时分，忽然有两个突击兵闯了进去。后门进前门出。经过院子时，大皮鞋蹬得震天响。那副横行直撞的神气孩子都骇哭了。
    一个在香港耽过的广东太太说，这种自由地进入民家，只有香港沦陷时，日本鬼也这样做过。想不到没有敌人的地方还是一样的情形。
            恐怖的突击
    在这前一日，上庄村另一家姓田的新婚夫妇却遭到更恐怖的突击。
    是一个深沉的夜晚，男人忽发觉窗外有人影浮动。正待出声，门就被三个突击兵狠狠的踢开了。随即他夫妇俩被反绑在一堆。男人挨了一顿“惩戒”临去，他们的门也被倒锁了。
    事后，他夫妇俩还是摸不到底细。不知犯了什么要受到这样的迫害。不过他记起了一桩事，白天为了他妻子被人欺侮，曾与他们吵过的。于是夜半就遭到这恐怖的“突击”。并且被迫而迁徙了。
            这是什么样的世界啊！
    欺压、侮辱、损害、的恐怖魔影，还在紧压着人们的心！魔影的足迹在追踪着人们的路子，威胁着人们的生活！魔影的巨掌在攫夺着人们的自由，在遮断着晴空上的阳光！
    胜利后的今日，昆明还是鬼魅的世界啊！
                                      三月十日昆明
