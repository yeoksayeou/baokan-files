Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 23rd: TASS reports: *Pravda's* international observer, Isakov, writes: The governments of twenty-one nations will convene in Paris on July 29th to discuss the drafting of peace treaties with former German allies.

　　At the previous Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, thorough preparations had been made for the upcoming peace conference, draft treaties had been prepared, and agreements had been reached on contentious issues, although these agreements were not entirely satisfactory, they were at least acceptable.

　　The decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers presented the conditions for the victorious work of the twenty-one nation peace conference. Using these resolutions as a basis, the conference will be able to offer its suggestions and elaborate in greater detail the peace treaties with the former German allies. However, even now, some people are advocating for the sabotage of this only correct and convenient procedure. For example, *Le Populaire*, the organ of the French Socialist Party, has taken such a stance, arguing that the twenty-one nation peace conference should not be bound by the decisions of the four powers. Clearly, there are still those who wish postwar diplomacy to follow the principle of "one step forward, two steps back." One of the representatives of these people is US Senator Vandenberg. This week, he reported on the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in the Senate. Vandenberg reappeared in his old guise, engaging in activities to pit Western countries against the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. For example, he said that the twenty-one nation peace conference would not be able to determine the final peace or decide on the final treaty, "because of the opposition of the Soviet delegation." However, even at the Moscow Council of Foreign Ministers meeting last December, a resolution was passed to convene a twenty-one nation peace conference, which would be limited to providing suggestions for the draft treaties. The final right to formulate the treaties would remain with the major powers that bore the brunt of the war against Germany and its allies. It is at least unfair to now attribute this jointly established procedure to the unilateral insistence of the Soviet delegation. In his speech in the Senate, Senator Vandenberg made no secret of his regret, saying: if only the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France were at the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, "complete agreement could be reached in ten days, including an agreement on the preliminary drafts of the treaties with Germany and Austria." Logically, it can be said that this American senator means that if only the United States were at the meeting, then "complete agreement" could be reached in just ten minutes. However, the only problem is that this desire does not conform to the democratic principles that Mr. Vandenberg speaks of so often, nor does it conform to the true balance of power between the major powers and their roles in this war. It is also worth mentioning that Senator Vandenberg was one of those who predicted the failure of the last Council of Foreign Ministers meeting. He even publicly published this prediction in the newspaper, despite his official position as part of the American delegation attending the meeting. Now, in the anti-Soviet bloc of Britain, France, and the United States, he is again trying to sow seeds of doubt about the future of the peace conference. One can expect that this time, he and others like him will once again prove to be inaccurate prophets.

### 真理报观察家揭露  范登堡图破坏和会

    范登堡图破坏和会
    【新华社延安二十三日电】塔斯社报导：真理报国际观察家伊沙科夫写道：二十一国政府将于七月二十九日在巴黎聚会，讨论拟制对前德国同盟国家的和约问题。
    在前一次外长会议上，对于即将到来的和会已经作了彻底的准备工作，和约草案已经拟就，而在争执的问题上也已获致协议，虽然这些协议并不是完全令人满意的，但至少是可以接受的。
    外长会议的决定，提出了二十一国和会工作胜利的条件。以他们的这些决议作为基础，和会将能提供自己的建议，并能在更详细的细节上精心拟制对前德国同盟国的和约。但是，甚至到现在还有某些人主张破坏这一唯一正确而便利的程序，比如法国社会党机关报大众报便采取这种立场，该报认为二十一国和会不应受四强决议的拘束。显然的，现在仍旧有人希望战后外交遵循进一步退两步的原则，这种人的代表之一，是美国参议员范登堡，本星期他在参院报告外长会议，范登堡又以他的老姿态出现，从事使西方诸国与苏联及东欧各国对立起来的活动。比如他说二十一国和会将不能决定最后和平和决定最后和约，这是“因为苏联代表团的反对”。然而甚至去年十二月的莫斯科外长会议上便已通过决议，召开二十一国和会，这一和会将仅限于向和约草案提供建议，和约的最后制定权仍保留给曾经首当对德国及其同盟国战争之要冲的强国。现在把这种共同确立的程序归诸苏联代表团单方面的坚持，至少是不公平的。参议员范登堡在他的参院讲演中，毫不隐蔽地表示遗憾说：如果外长会议上只有美、英、法三国代表，“十天内便能达到完全协议，其中还包括对德与对奥初步草约的协议”。从逻辑上推演下去，可以说这位美参议员的意思是说：如果会议上只有美国一国的话，那末只要十分钟便能达到“完全协议”了。但是，唯一的问题是这种愿望是不符合于范登堡先生口里那样说来说去的民主原则的，自然也不符合于诸强国间真正的力量对比关系、以及他们在这次战争中的作用。还值得提出的，是这位参议员范登堡正是曾经预言上次外长会议失败的人之一，他甚至不顾他自己是处于美国出席会议的代表团中的官方地位而在报上公开发表这种预见。现在他在英法美反苏集团中，又在企图为和会的前途散播怀疑的种子了。人们可以期望，这一次他和他这一类的人将再度证明是一些不灵验的预言家。
