　　Xinhua News Agency, Boshan, 8th: The Kuomintang 8th Army in Weixian and Changle has been fiercely attacking westward along the Jiaoji Railway for the past half month. After effective resistance by the Lubei 8th Route Army and the broad masses of militiamen, Yidu City, Yidu Station, and Linzi City, which were once occupied, have been successively recovered by the military and civilians of the liberated areas. The Kuomintang 8th Army, originally stationed in Weixian and Changle, comprises the 103rd Division, the 166th Division, and the Honorary 1st Division. This army, with substantial airlifted supplies and air force cooperation from Qingdao, left the Honorary 1st Division to garrison the original locations, and the other two divisions launched a fierce westward attack, occupying Yidu City and Yidu Station on the 27th of last month. Subsequently, the 166th Division continued its northwestward offensive, occupying Linzi City on the 3rd of this month. The 103rd Division advanced to Jinling, then gathered its forces, attempting to invade the Zichuan and Boshan coal-producing areas. At this point, the Lubei 8th Route Army could no longer tolerate it and resolutely and bravely resisted, receiving enthusiastic support from the militiamen of the respective counties. On the 3rd, Yidu City and Yidu Station were recovered, and on the 5th, Linzi City and Xindian and other stations were also recovered. Currently, there are no Kuomintang troops between Jinling in the east and Putong Station in the west, and 100 li of railway from Yangzhuang to Xinzhuang is again under the control of the military and civilians of the liberated areas.
    [This month, Heze, 8th]: The Dawenkou Station on the Jinpu Railway in Tai'an, Shandong, was recovered by our army on July 1st. This station was liberated by our army from the puppet troops before the liberation of Tai'an. Later, the puppet troops from the Hongbu and Xinjie strongholds near the station, with the support of Kuomintang airlift, suddenly occupied Dawenkou again, and extensively repaired bunkers and fortifications, attacking us. Our army resolutely disarmed the puppet troops in the area on the 1st, conquering Dawenkou in one fell swoop. All the puppet troops entrenched in the area were completely annihilated, with over 1,000 captured alive, and numerous guns and military supplies seized. The local people, liberated from the oppression of the puppet troops, were very grateful and enthusiastically brought gifts to warmly comfort their liberators – the 8th Route Army.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th]: Military News: After the central area of the Central Plains Military Region, Xuanhuadian, was captured, our Central Plains forces, in order to survive, have broken through in several directions. Currently, in addition to continuing to carry out a brutal "mopping-up" operation against our military and civilians in the liberated areas east of the Pinghan Railway, the Kuomintang army is also actively forming a new encirclement west of the Pinghan Railway, launching a fierce offensive against our westward-moving forces. The Kuomintang forces participating in the "mopping-up" operation in the eastern area include the main force of the 72nd Army in Xuanhuadian and its southwest Yuhuangcheng area and the Mulan Mountain area southwest of Huang'an, the 174th Division of the 48th Army in the Guangshan, Jingfu, and Macheng area, a part of the 18th Army in the Lishan and its south Meidian area, and the 47th Army, originally "mopping up" in the Popi River area southwest of Guangshan, is now advancing towards Xinyang. The people in various places east of the railway have been subjected to indiscriminate arrests, beatings, rapes, and looting, resulting in a very tragic situation. In addition, in order to be able to transfer more troops to the west to attack us, the Kuomintang army has mobilized local security teams from Huangchuan, Guangshan, Luoshan, and Shangcheng to participate in the "mopping-up." As for the west of the Pinghan Railway, the Kuomintang's offensive against us is even fiercer. After a part of our army broke through to the west of the railway, the 20th Division of the 40th Army, located in Zhaoyang, hurriedly moved east to Tianhekou southwest of Tongbai, along the line of Gaocheng north of Suixian and Lishan northwest of Suixian, launching a fierce attack against us, engaging in fierce fighting all day on the 4th. At the same time, a part of the main force of the 15th Army, blockading the Pinghan Railway, launched a fierce advance and pursuit towards Gaocheng and Lishan from Tongbai and Wushengguan on the 4th. Even the main force of the 41st Army, originally conducting "mopping-up" operations in the east of the railway and guarding Xinyang, Minggang, etc., is now advancing westward towards Tianhekou, attempting to form a new encirclement of over 100,000 people in the Suixian-Zhaoyang area to continue its "annihilation" plot against our army. Kuomintang aircraft have also been dispatched daily to assist in the battle, resulting in many casualties among peaceful civilians.
