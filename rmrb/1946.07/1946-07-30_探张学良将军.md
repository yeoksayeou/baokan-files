Visiting General Zhang Xueliang
　　Si Liao
Mr. Mo Dehui, who has served as a senator in successive sessions and is one of the members of the Presidium of the Political Participation Council, is an old man over sixty. He is generally respectfully referred to as Old Man Mo Liu. He is General Zhang Xueliang's "father's friend." He is very eager to save the country and his hometown. In any gathering in Chongqing, when he mentions the Northeast and thinks of the white mountains and black waters, he often sheds tears in his impassioned speeches.

At the beginning of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Mo flew to various parts of the Northeast to express his condolences. He was warmly welcomed by the elders in the Northeast. The elders in the Northeast poured out their fourteen years of suffering and tears. Almost at every welcome meeting, someone asked about General Zhang Xueliang's recent situation, "Where is the Young Marshal? Why hasn't he led his troops back to his hometown at the time of the restoration of the Northeast?" This question of concern to the people of the Northeast often made it difficult for Old Man Mo Liu to answer, causing a burst of sadness. More than once, he made a solemn oath to the elders in the Northeast: "The next time I return to my hometown, I will definitely bring Hanqing (General Zhang's alias) with me to meet the elders who have been separated for more than ten years, otherwise I would rather die in Guan Nei (inside the Pass) ..............."

Mr. Mo flew back to Chongqing, he never forgot the expectations of the elders in the Northeast. First, he visited Zhang Yuejun and Shao Lizi, asking them to convey to the authorities the request to immediately release General Zhang Xueliang. He also planned to make this request in the Political Consultative Conference, because from a larger perspective, the Anti-Japanese War was won and he should be allowed to return to the Northeast, and from a smaller perspective, the imprisonment period had long passed, but it was ineffective.

After the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Mo obtained Chiang's consent and drove on the Chongqing-Yu road to visit General Zhang Xueliang, who was still under "discipline."

The car sped near Tongzi. The special "attendant" accompanying Mr. Mo in the same car pointed to a small village leaning against the mountains and rivers and said, "The white-walled house is where General Zhang lives." Mr. Mo was so emotional that he couldn't help but shed tears. Two minutes later, General Zhang Xueliang heard the news and rushed out of the house to greet Mr. Mo warmly. The two shook hands tightly, their eyes moist.

Zhang's health is very good, only because of the long-term "discipline", his attitude is a little more profound than before. Because of his constant hard reading by the oil lamp, it damaged his eyesight, and now he has to wear 200-degree glasses when reading newspapers.

Mr. Mo lived with Mr. Zhang for a week, eating and relaxing together. In fact, when they took walks in the suburbs, there were still inseparable figures beside them. Fortunately, they didn't talk about politics or military affairs, only about academic views and the art of fish farming and cooking. According to Mr. Mo's conversation with people after returning to Chongqing, Mr. Zhang has read a lot of books in recent years, not only burying himself in reading, but also personally operating, planting gardens, raising fish and chickens, and engaging in production.

Once, Zhang earnestly expressed to Mo that he hoped to study in a domestic university for a few more years. Mr. Mo praised his enthusiasm for learning, but suggested that it is best to go abroad for further studies.

He estimated his chances of being released as follows: (1) He could be released on the day of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. (2) He could be released if all parties and factions in the country unite and cooperate. The former estimate has now proven to be inaccurate. Will the latter estimate be accurate? It depends on the future.

Mr. Zhang is only allowed to read the Central Daily News and the Ta Kung Pao every day, so he also knows a little about the continuous artillery fire outside the Pass. His view on the Northeast issue is that the Northeast issue is not only a problem for the people of the Northeast, but also a problem related to the survival of the whole country. The key to solving the problem is to start with respecting the people of the Northeast. (Excerpted from "Democracy" Issue 31)

　　探张学良将军
    思辽
    抗战后，连任历届参议员，并为参政会主席团之一的莫德惠老先生，已是六十以上的老人，一般人皆尊称为莫柳老。他是张学良将军的“父执”。救国救乡之心甚切，在重庆任何集会中，当他提到东北，想起白山黑水时，常在慷慨陈词中，热泪纵横。
    抗战胜利之初，莫氏飞赴东北各地宣慰，初到之处，备受东北父老欢迎，东北父老并向他倾诉这十四个年头的辛酸血泪，几乎在每一次欢迎会中，都有人问起张学良将军的近况，“少帅究竟在那里，为什么值此东北光复之时，还不统率人马返故乡？”这一个东北人士关切的问题，常使莫柳老难以回答，引起一阵辛酸。曾经不是一次，他向东北父老作郑重的誓言：“下一次重返家乡，我一定带了汉卿（张将军号）同来，和阔别十余年的父老们见面，否则我宁愿死在关内…………………”
    莫柳老飞返重庆，他无时无刻忘记了东北父老们的期望。首先，他拜访张岳军和邵力子，请转达当局，要求立即释放张学良将军。他也准备在政协中提出这个要求，因为从大的方面讲，抗战胜利了，应该让他回东北，从小的方面言，监禁期限早已过了，但是无效。
    政协闭幕，莫氏得蒋之同意，驱车筑渝道上，探视犹在“管教”中的张学良将军。
    小汽车疾驶到桐梓附近，伴同莫柳老同车而去的特殊“招待员”遥指倚山倚水一小村落说：“白墙房子即张将军住处。”莫柳老一动情感，禁不住热泪泉涌。两分钟后，张学良将军闻讯从屋里跃奔车前，热烈迎迓莫氏，两人紧紧的握手，眼睛都是湿润的。
    张的健康情形甚好，只因经历长期“管教”，态度比从前稍为深沉一点。由经常在油灯旁边苦读，损害了他的目光，现在看书报时，要戴二百度的眼镜。
    莫柳老与张氏同住了一礼拜，一同进餐，一同游息。事实上，当他们散步郊游之时，仍有形影不离的人物在旁。好在他们不谈政事，不谈军事，只谈一些学术上的见解，养鱼烹饪之道而已。据莫氏返渝后对人谈，张氏这几年来读的书可真不少，不仅埋首研读，而且还亲自操作，种园艺、养鱼养鸡，从事生产。
    有一次，张恳切的向莫表示，他希望再进国内大学读几年书。莫老嘉许他的学习热忱，但建议最好到国外去谋深造。
    他对自己的能否获释，这样估计：（一）抗战胜利之日，可以释放。（二）全国各党各派团结合作，可以释放。前一估计，现已证明其不准，后一估计会不会准呢？这要看今后了。
    张氏每天仅许读中央日报和大公报，因此关外炮火连天，他亦略知一二。他对东北问题的看法是，东北问题不仅是东北人民的问题，而是全国生存致关的问题。解决问题的关键，要从尊重东北人民做起。（录自《民主》三十一期）
