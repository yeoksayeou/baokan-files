Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 13th: Chongqing News—Li Gongpu, one of the Seven Gentlemen of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, was suddenly assassinated by Kuomintang secret agents in Kunming the night before last. On the evening of July 11th, at about 10 PM, Mr. Li, accompanied by his wife, Madam Zhang Manyun, and his son, took a public bus back to his residence on North Gate Street. After getting off at the Xueyuanpo bus stop, they were walking towards Xueyuanpo when they were suddenly shot at by Chiang's secret agents, who were lying in wait there. Mr. Li was caught off guard; a bullet pierced his abdomen, and he instantly bled profusely, falling to the ground unconscious. The secret agents then calmly escaped. Mr. Li was rushed by his wife to the Affiliated Hospital of Yunnan University for treatment, but he died at 5:30 AM yesterday morning due to the severity of the wound and excessive blood loss.

It is reported that Mr. Li Gongpu was from Wujin, Jiangsu, and was 46 years old. He was one of the leaders of the National Salvation Association. In 1936, Mr. Li, along with Zou Taofen, Ji Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Shi Liang, Sha Qianli, and Wang Zaoshi, were arrested and imprisoned by the Kuomintang authorities for organizing an anti-Japanese national salvation movement and calling for an end to the civil war and unity against foreign aggression. This was the famous Seven Gentlemen Incident in Chinese history. They were not released from prison until after the start of the Anti-Japanese War. During and after the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Li consistently worked actively for the patriotic democratic movement and became one of the leaders beloved by the Chinese people from all walks of life. In the Jiaochangkou Bloodshed Incident on February 10th of this year, Mr. Li was severely injured by Kuomintang secret agent thugs with iron bars. In the hospital, Mr. Li told people from all walks of life who came to express their condolences, "I will die without regret for the cause of the democratic movement." Mr. Li was also a famous Chinese educator and served as the principal of "Liangcai Supplementary School" before the Anti-Japanese War. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, he was the president of Shanxi National Revolutionary University (it should be noted that at that time, the school was a progressive anti-Japanese school). After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, he assisted Mr. Tao Xingzhi in founding Social University and served as its vice president.

Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government Assembly

To Madam Manyun: Just as the Kuomintang reactionaries are actively expanding the nationwide civil war, attacking our Border Region from all sides, and sending secret agents to infiltrate the liberated areas to carry out terrorist activities, we were shocked and deeply saddened to learn that the democratic fighter Mr. Li Gongpu was also tragically assassinated by Chiang's secret agents! Mr. Gongpu's death calls on the people of the whole country to heighten their vigilance and strictly guard against the shameless attacks of the fascist ringleader Chiang Kai-shek, and calls on patriotic people across the nation to inherit Mr. Gongpu's unfulfilled ambitions and fight to the end against national betrayal, against civil war, and against dictatorship! We hereby send our condolences, hoping you will restrain your grief and take care of yourself for the sake of the country.
