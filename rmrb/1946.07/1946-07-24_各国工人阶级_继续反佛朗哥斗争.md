    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st] A comprehensive report on the workers of various countries continuing the struggle against Franco:
    Mexican Confederation of Labor Secretary-General Velázquez and Labor Confederation Secretary Torinaño are currently discussing a plan in Mexico City regarding the implementation of a shipping boycott against Spain.

    【新华社延安二十一日电】综合报导各国工人阶级继续反佛朗哥斗争：
    墨西哥工会总书记佛拉支克斯及××总工会书记托利那诺，关于对西班牙实行航运抵制之计划，刻在墨西哥城商谈中，该劳工领袖同意墨西哥之工会将不搬运开往或来自西班牙的货物。智利职工会与古巴马头工人亦开始抵运西货。瑞典共产党人与曾参加西国内战的国际纵队队员，日前曾在瑞京组织四千余人的反佛朗哥群众大会。英国职工会大会日前发表纪念西班牙内战十周年的宣言称，坚决要求联合国组织在其未来大会中表现出文明世界的感情，断绝与西的关系，并帮助在西重建民主政权。宣言重复号召英国政府与西断绝关系，并称职工大会常委会关于此事，将向联合国提出建议。
