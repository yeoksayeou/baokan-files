The people in the Liberated Areas are universally singing praises of their great leader, Mao Zedong. This singing comes from the mouths of the broad masses of the people, sincere and heartfelt. They sing because they have achieved the supreme joy of victory under the leadership of Mao Zedong.

What is selected here are a few excellent songs from the common people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region praising Mao Zedong; this is merely a drop in the ocean. Countless people are singing praises of Mao Zedong at all times, in mass meetings, on the roads, in the fields, in the Yangge dance troupes... This singing is flying everywhere, and new ones are being created at any time. Here, I am only selecting some based on existing materials and personal memory to introduce to the readers.

            One

	In the second month, the spring wind blows,
	Mao Zedong comes up from Jiangxi,
	Mao Zedong's power is heavy,
	He sits on a plane in the sky,
	Followed by a million soldiers.

            Two

	The whole country moves to war,
	All come out to fight,
	A great flag flutters in the sky,
	Who is so awe-inspiring:
	Zhu De, Mao Zedong.

The above two songs originated in 1936. "The whole country moves to war, all come out to fight" refers to the anti-Japanese movement at that time. Zhu De and Mao Zedong were the flag bearers and pioneers of this movement. The first song is a section from the famous revolutionary folk song "Liu Zhidan."

            Three

	Our labor heroes come to the meeting,
	We saw the production exhibits,
	The top sight in Yan'an.
	Our Chairman Mao calls out——
	Dragon coils, tiger crouches on the mountain top;
	A ten-thousand-zhang high building rises from the ground.
	Our labor heroes go home
	Everyone's heart is happy.
	Our Chairman Mao is like a sun;
	Like a pot of flowers rising from the East Sea,
	Shining on our border region people as one family.
	Like a piece of gold coming from the sky,
	The border region people look at it with one heart.

The above two paragraphs were not written down, but spoken orally. The author is labor hero Sun Wanfu, from Quzi County, over sixty years old, now deceased. In 1943, when attending the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Labor Hero Conference, at the meeting where Chairman Mao received them, these seventeen labor heroes, this old hero stood up from his chair, walked close to Chairman Mao, and hugged Chairman Mao's shoulders tightly with both hands. His beard, wet with saliva, trembled as he said: "A great turn-over! We have food to eat, clothes to wear, debts paid, land redeemed, and cattle and sheep. All of this is given by you. Without you, we poor people would crawl on the ground for a lifetime and never be able to stand up!" He passionately loved and sang praises of Mao Zedong, comparing Mao Zedong to a "ten-thousand-zhang high building," and at the same time expressing the correct relationship between the people's leader and the people: "A ten-thousand-zhang high building rises from the ground."

            Four

	The East is red, the sun rises,
	China has produced a Mao Zedong,
	He seeks survival for the people,
	He is the great savior of the people.

	The border region is red, the border region is red,
	There are no poor people in the border region,
	Some poor people are selected to immigrate,
	Breaking off the roots of poverty to stand up.

	Three mountains are low, five peaks are high,
	Chairman Mao governs the country with meritorious service,
	The border region is run excellently,
	The common people praise Tang Yao.
	Production and mutual aid are done well,
	There are no robbers in the border region,
	Doors are not locked at night, dogs do not bite,
	Comrades Mao and Zhu have contributed greatly.

The above sections are very famous songs. The first section, "The East is red, the sun rises," was once popular in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Sui, and Zhangjiakou. It was a collaboration between Li Zengzheng, a farmer from the Third Township of the Chengguan District of Jia County, and his uncle, Li Youyuan. This uncle and nephew are famous singers in Jia County. The "immigration" referred to in the song refers to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government's call in 1943 for poor people in the northern part of the border region to move to the southern part to reclaim wasteland and produce for a better life, because there was less land and more people in the north, while there was more wasteland and fewer people in the south.

            Five

	The Great Wall is Mao Zedong,
	Zhu De serves as commander-in-chief,
	He Long has rendered meritorious service in the War of Resistance,
	Zhou Enlai is the number one diplomat.

	People's leader Mao Zedong,
	Our border region is the most glorious,
	Put more effort into production and education.
	Two major tasks must be completed.

The author is Ren Luxue, from Taozhen, Mizhi, a small businessman. He compares Mao Zedong to the "Great Wall." According to his own explanation, it is because: "The Great Wall protects the Central Plains, and Mao Zedong protects our common people." The "production" and "education" referred to in the song are the two major tasks proposed by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government in 1943.

            Six

	The border region people must be of one heart,
	Ancient trees bloom, shining red on the mountains,
	Thousand-year-old trees are rooted,
	Flowering and bearing fruit rely on the stability of the mountain.

	The atmosphere is broad in Yan'an Prefecture,
	The Eighth Route Army occupies the land of rice and grain,
	Chairman Mao leads the common people,
	Abundant food and clothing are not difficult.

The author is Gong Weizhong, from Yangjiagou, Mizhi, a farmer. Regarding his song, he himself explained: "Ancient trees blooming" means that "the common people stand up, just like ancient trees blooming," "relying on the stability of the mountain" means: "The common people today have a mountain to rely on, and this mountain is Chairman Mao. With Chairman Mao as a backer, the common people can stand firmly!"

            Seven

	In the first month, celebrate the Lantern Festival,
	The golden plaque is embroidered,
	The golden plaque is embroidered with our Chairman Mao,
	The leader's ideas are high.

	Embroider Chairman Mao,
	The people's good fortune,
	You wholeheartedly love us,
	We support you!

The author is Wang Tingyou, from the Guanzhong sub-region, a carpenter, and was elected as a border region cultural and educational hero in 1944. These are two sections from his famous work "Ten Embroidered Golden Plaques."

### 人民歌颂毛泽东

　　人民歌颂毛泽东
    解放区的人民，普遍地在歌颂着自己的伟大的领袖毛泽东，这歌声发自广大人民的口中，真诚而亲切。他们歌唱因为有了毛泽东的领导，而取得了胜利的无上欢欣。
    这里所选的是陕甘宁边区的老百姓歌唱毛泽东几首优秀的歌，这仅是大海中之一滴。无数人民无时不在歌唱着毛泽东，在群众的会议上，在道路上，在庄稼地里，在秧歌队中………这歌声在到处飞扬，而且随时有新的产生。这里只是根据现有的材料及个人的记忆选出一些，介绍给读者。
　
            一
　
        二月里来刮春风，
        江西上来个毛泽东，
        毛泽东来势力重，
        他坐上飞机在空中，
        后带百万兵。
　
            二
　
        全国动刀兵，
        一齐来出征，
        一杆大旗飘扬在空中，
        威风凛凛是哪个：
        朱德、毛泽东。
    以上两首产生于一九三六年，“全国动刀兵，一齐来出征”系指当时抗日运动。朱德毛泽东是这运动的旗手与先锋。第一首是著名的革命民歌《刘志丹》中的一段。
　
            三
　
        咱们劳动英雄来开会，
        看了生产展览品，
        延安的头一景。
        咱们毛主席号召——
        蟠龙卧虎高山顶；
        万丈高楼从地起。
        咱们劳动英雄回家
        个个心里喜。
        咱们毛主席比如一个太阳；
        比如东海上来一盆花，
        照到咱们边区人民是一家。
        比如空中过来一块金，
        边区人民瞅到一条心。
    以上这两段不是写出的，而是口述的。作者是劳动英雄孙万福，曲子县人，六十余岁，现已故。一九四三年参加陕甘宁边区劳动英雄大会时在毛主席接见他们十七位劳动英雄的会上，这位老英雄从椅子上站起来走近毛主席，两手紧紧地抱着毛主席的肩膀，沾着口沫的胡须在颤动着说：“大翻身哪！有了吃，有了穿，账也还了，地也赎了，牛羊也有了，这都是你给的，没有你，我们这些穷汉爬在地下一辈子也站不起来”！他热情地爱戴与歌唱毛泽东，它把毛泽东比做“万丈高楼”，同时把人民的领袖与人民的正确关系说出：“万丈高楼从地起”。
　
            四
　
        东方红，太阳升，
        中国出了个毛泽东，
        他给人民谋生存，
        他是人民大救星。
　
        边区红，边区红，
        边区地方没穷人，
        有些穷人选移民，
        挖断穷根要翻身。
　
        三山低，五岳高，
        毛主席治国有勋劳，
        边区办的呱呱叫，
        老百姓颂唐尧。
        生产变工搞的好，
        边区地方没强盗，
        夜不闭户狗不咬，
        毛、朱同志有功劳。
    以上之几段是很有名的歌，第一段“东方红，太阳升”曾流行陕甘宁、晋绥及张家口等地。为葭县城关区三乡农民李增正及其叔李有源合作，他叔侄两人为葭县有名歌手。歌中所指“移民”为一九四三年陕甘宁边区政府号召边区北部贫民移往南部开荒生产过好光景，因为北部地少人多，南部则荒地多人口少。
            五
　
        万里长城毛泽东，
        朱德担任总司令，
        抗战有功是贺龙，
        周恩来外交是第一名。
　
        人民领袖毛泽东，
        咱们边区最光荣，
        生产教育多加工。
        两大任务要完成。
    作者为任履学，米脂桃镇人，小商人。他把毛泽东比做“万里长城”，照他自己的解释，为：“长城保护了中原地面，毛泽东保护了我们老百姓。”歌中所指“生产”“教育”为一九四三年陕甘宁边区政府提出的两大任务。
            六
　
        边区人民要一心，
        古树开花耀山红，
        千年的古树盘了根，
        开花结子靠山稳。
　
        延安府里地气宽，
        八路军占了米粮川，
        毛主席领导老百姓，
        丰衣足食不困难。
    作者巩维忠，米脂杨家沟人，农民。对于他的歌，他自己这样解释：“古树开花”是说“老百姓翻身，好比古树也开了花一样”，“靠山稳”是说：“老百姓今天有了靠山，这架山就是毛主席，有了毛主席做靠山，老百姓就站得稳稳价！”
            七
　
        正月里闹元宵，
        金匾绣成了，
        金匾绣咱毛主席，
        领导的主意高。
　
        一绣毛主席，
        人民的福气，
        你一心爱我们，
        我们拥护你！
    作者为汪庭有，关中分区人，木匠，一九四四年当选为边区文教英雄。这是他的名作《十绣金匾》中的两段。
                                                  （贺敬之辑）
