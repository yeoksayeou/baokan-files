Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th: Educational construction work in Songjiang and Heilongjiang provinces has been progressing rapidly in recent months. In Songjiang Province, in addition to restoring existing schools, county-run middle schools have been established in counties where secondary schools were not established during the puppet Manchukuo era. Counties where schools have already opened include Fangzheng, Mulan, Tonghe, and Babin. Fangzheng County Middle School has 180 students (including 20 female students) and 13 teachers. The male and female middle schools in Babin County were recently merged, with 580 male students. The aforementioned four counties have a total of 82 complete primary schools, higher primary schools, and junior primary schools, with over 7,700 students. In Heilongjiang Province, only seven counties, including Hailun and Suihua, already have over 41,400 children receiving the education of New Democracy. The number of children in school in the province has increased more than eightfold compared to the puppet Manchukuo era. For example, in Kedong County, the number of children in school before liberation was 284, but currently it is 2,352. The province's social education has also greatly developed compared to before. Currently, major cities and towns have established women's literacy classes, public education centers, public literacy assistance centers, street wall newspapers, and various music and drama groups in rural areas.
