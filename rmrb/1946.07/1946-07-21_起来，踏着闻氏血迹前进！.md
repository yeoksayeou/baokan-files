　　Following the martyrdom of Mr. Li Gongpu, we have received the news of the assassination of Mr. Wen Yiduo and his son. This is clearly a planned, vile, and brutal act carried out by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents! The "bloodthirstiness" of the secret agent boss Chiang Kai-shek, his hatred for all those who fight for independence, peace, and democracy, is once again fully exposed and proven today.

　　Good, Chiang Kai-shek dares to reveal his true colors today! It will make us more calmly recall: how many peaceful and democratic fighters have been massacred under his bloody rule of the past nineteen years! It will also make the people in the so-called recovered areas after the victory understand: what kind of gangster this thing that wore the cloak of eight years of resistance is… Apart from making us hate the fascist dictator even more, will the national democrats be intimidated by this terror? Will it stop the people from advancing?

　　The Chinese cultural circles—the countless outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation—embark on the path of struggle for peace and democracy, starting with bloodshed! It was so in the era of the Northern Warlords' rule, and it is so again under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang; but they have always been courageous, advancing wave upon wave, constantly advancing in blood, holding high the banner of independence, peace, and democracy! The rapid turning wheels of history cannot be without blood! In particular, Mr. Lu Xun told us: "Blood debts must be paid in blood!" We understand: this blood debt of the past nineteen years should and must be settled one day! We have also recently seen that Mihailović, who was once shameless in betraying the country for personal gain, could not escape death under the judgment of the people in the end! Isn't this the inevitable end of the followers of fascism?!

　　The strength of the Chinese people is many times stronger than before the war! Who can stop them from advancing? We are saddened today by the martyrdom of Mr. Wen Yiduo, but we know that if we do not turn grief into strength, if we do not express our indignation in action, then we cannot give the fascist dictators a serious counterattack!

　　All cultural workers in the Border Region, let us unite more closely, let us stand more closely with the people, and vow to be the backing of the national cultural circles, and advance along the bloodstained path of Mr. Wen Yiduo!

　　Victory is ours! Peace and democracy must be realized! The people must advance! The current fascist terror is precisely a manifestation of the desperation of a cornered beast, but it can never stop and resist the progress of history!

　　Let us hold high the banner of peace and democracy and advance by leaps and bounds! We must break through and eliminate the terror of the fascist reactionaries and realize the legacy of Mr. Wen Yiduo!

### 起来，踏着闻氏血迹前进！

　　起来，踏着闻氏血迹前进！
    继李公朴先生殉难以后，我们又听到了闻一多先生父子被难的消息。这显然是蒋记特务有计划的在进行卑鄙残酷的暴行！特务头子蒋介石之“嗜杀成性”，对一切为独立和平民主奋斗的人士的仇恨，今天又一次得到充分的暴露与证明。
    好的，蒋介石今天敢于这样显露自己的真面目！他将使我们更冷静的回忆一下：他过去十九年的血腥统治屠杀了多少和平民主的战士！也使胜利后所谓收复区的人民了解一下：这个披了八年抗战外衣的东西到底是个什么样的流氓家伙……除了使我们对法西斯独裁者更加憎恨外，难道全国民主人士会被这恐怖手段吓倒么？难道就会阻止人民前进么？
    中国文化界——中华民族无数的优秀儿女走向为和平民主而奋斗的道路，就是以流血开始的！在北洋军阀统治时代是如此，在国民党血腥统治下也复如此；但是从来都是勇往直前，前仆后继，在血泊中高举独立和平民主的大旗不断前进！历史的急转车轮上面不能没有血的！特别是鲁迅先生告诉过我们：“血债要用血来偿还！”我们懂得：十九年来的这一笔血债，总应该、必须有清算的一天！我们在最近还看到，曾经寡廉鲜耻卖国求荣的米海洛维区，最后也免不掉在人民的裁判下而死！难道这不是法西斯的徒子徒孙的必然的结局么？！
    中国人民的力量比起战前来不知强大多少倍了！谁还能阻止他们前进？我们今天固然悲痛闻一多先生的殉难，但我们知道：不把悲痛变成力量，不把我们的愤慨表现在行动上，那我们就不可能给法西斯独裁者以严重的回击！
    全边区文化工作者，我们更加团结起来，我们要更加和人民密切的站在一起，誓为全国文化界的后盾，踏着闻一多先生的血迹前进罢！
    胜利是我们的！和平民主一定要实现！人民一定要前进！目前法西斯的恐怖恰恰是表现了困兽犹斗那种疯狂性，但他绝不能阻止和抵挡历史的前进！
    我们高举和平民主的旗子大踏步的前进罢！我们一定要冲破并且消灭法西斯反动派的恐怖，实现闻一多先生的遗志！
