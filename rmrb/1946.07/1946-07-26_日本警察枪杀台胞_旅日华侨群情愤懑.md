Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 23rd: Tokyo dispatch: On the evening of the 19th, an incident occurred in Tokyo in which Japanese police shot and killed Taiwanese compatriots, resulting in the deaths of four Taiwanese compatriots and injuries to more than twenty. The shooting was instigated by Japanese financial tycoons. These Taiwanese compatriots had been subjected to great oppression before the Japanese surrender, and they gathered in the open-air area of Shinbashi to set up stalls to make a living. After the Allied forces occupied Japan, the owner of the open space in Shinbashi, the master of a Japanese company, not only did not change his abusive behavior towards our Taiwanese compatriots but also wanted to drive them out of the open space. Due to the pressure of livelihood, the Taiwanese compatriots had repeatedly negotiated with the company owner, but unexpectedly, he sent a thousand ruffians to attack the Taiwanese compatriots, and the Japanese police, under the direction of the company owner, opened fire on the Taiwanese compatriots, causing heavy casualties. Afterwards, our overseas Chinese in Japan were greatly angered and unanimously demanded that the violent perpetrators be severely punished.

　　日本警察枪杀台胞
    旅日华侨群情愤懑
    【新华社延安二十三日电】东京讯：十九日晚，发生日警枪杀东京我台胞事件，死台胞四名，伤二十余名。枪杀案为日财阀所指使。此等台胞在日投降前曾备受压迫，相聚在新桥租露天地区搭货摊以维生。盟军占领日本后，新桥旷地所有者即日本公司主人，不仅不改变虐待我台胞之行为，并欲驱台胞出该旷地。台胞迫于生计，曾多次向公司主人交涉，不意彼竟遣浪人千名袭击台胞，而日警复在该公司主人指使下向台胞开枪，致造成重大伤亡。事后我旅日侨胞大为愤懑，一致要求予凶暴的事主以严厉惩办。
