　　The Army Serves the People, the Masses Arm Themselves to Protect Grain
    Taihang and Taiyue Achieve Victory in Countering Grain Seizures
    The 50th Regiment of the Third Sub-district of Taihang forced back seven stubborn puppet grain grabbing strongholds, liberating more than fifty villages, and killing or capturing more than 300 stubborn puppets.
    [Report from this newspaper] The anti-grain seizure struggles on the Taihang and Taiyue fronts continue to achieve victories.
    In the Taihang area: In the vast border areas of the Third Sub-district, our army struck at the stubborn puppets who were seizing wheat by force, completing the glorious task of protecting the masses' wheat harvest, and achieved a brilliant victory. Currently, with high enthusiasm, the troops throughout the area have entered a new stage of more intense anti-grain seizure struggle. Before the start of the tense summer harvest defense battle, the troops throughout the area universally conducted current affairs education and ideological education, recognizing the conspiracy of the stubborn puppets and the importance of protecting the masses' wheat harvest. Song Qizhu, a squad leader of the 53rd Regiment, said: "If the reactionaries do not withdraw the troops attacking the liberated areas, I will never ask for leave." A soldier named He × said: "I had set a date to marry my wife, but now I will postpone it." Therefore, they demonstrated extraordinary bravery in the battle to protect the wheat harvest. Before each battle, many comrades of the 50th Regiment handed over their money to the public, preparing to sacrifice themselves for the people. Shi Lianming, the deputy platoon leader of the ×× Detachment, wrote a letter to the leaders of the detachment saying: "I hope that after my sacrifice, I will be counted as a Communist Party member, and I will hand over my private savings of three thousand yuan to the Party as Party dues." Under this high degree of loyalty to sacrifice for the interests of the people, in more than ten days of intense fighting, according to incomplete statistics: the 50th Regiment recovered and forced back seven stubborn puppet grain grabbing strongholds including Ma, Ge ×, Liuhetun, Lihezhai, Pangjiawa, Wujiawa, Aogang, Xiwanjian, and Miaokou, liberating more than fifty villages, killing or wounding 310 stubborn puppets, capturing more than fifty, and seizing more than forty guns. The Democratic Nation-Building Detachment repelled seven attacks by stubborn puppets in eight days, while also covering and assisting the masses in harvesting wheat. By the beginning of June, the wheat harvest in the entire area had been successfully completed. Now, Li Changwu and other troops of the puppet army in Huihuo and Xinhui have begun to seize grain, conscript laborers, and seize livestock in Zhangtun, Nanxugou, and Zhangfeicheng. The troops throughout the area have entered a new stage of anti-grain seizure struggle.
    Our army in Zhengtai East Qin is doing its utmost to protect grain. From the 13th to the 19th, it repelled 17 attacks by Yan's army, killing or wounding more than 300 stubborn puppets. It disarmed the puppet army at Chengjialong station on the Zhengtai line, which often came out to seize wheat, seizing one mortar, four grenade launchers, seventeen light machine guns, and more than 170 rifles. We also suffered casualties of 180 people, including a regimental commander.
           Yan's Army of 7,000 from Datong and Puzhou Invades to Seize Wheat, All Are Repelled by Our Army, Killing or Wounding 500
    In the Taiyue area: In the Pinglu area, our army has initially shattered Yan's army's plan to seize 400,000 jin of wheat in Pinglu. Except for the 38 mu of land belonging to the family of a soldier that was burned down by secret agents, the grain of 45,000 people has been successfully hidden. In half a month, we repelled more than 60 attacks by stubborn puppet grain seizing teams of about ten people, and repelled seven attacks of more than 30 people. According to the Taiyue Xinhua Daily on June 15, in the first half of June, Yan's army used more than 7,000 troops on the Datong-Puzhou line to seize wheat, and invaded 35 villages including Tai Bi. All were repelled by our army and people, and Yan's army suffered more than 500 casualties. On June 14, the "Love the Country Corps" of Yan's army in Xiangling, combined with more than 80 secret agents, launched a sneak attack on the village of Xiaxiliang to seize wheat. At that time, seven militiamen from the village resisted the stubborn army, which outnumbered us by eleven to one, and repelled three fierce attacks by Yan's army, finally achieving victory. In Taiyue, more than 5,000 militiamen and more than 10,000 self-defense forces participated in this anti-grain seizure campaign. They formed three types of anti-grain seizure teams to protect their grain. The first type is the militia rotation team, mostly composed of expeditionary teams formed by core militiamen, also known as armed work teams. The second type is the militia in the local township and county, implementing joint village defense, with each village supporting each other in times of trouble. The third type is the broad masses of people, a labor-military combination of mutual aid teams, with one hand holding a hoe and the other holding a gun. The main force of the 69th Division of Yan's army, which is assembled in Linfen to seize grain and launch attacks, has recently launched a frantic offensive against us. On the 17th, the 69th Division, with more than 2,000 people, surrounded the villages of Lianli, Qianfu, and Beixuan in two routes. Our defending troops rose up to defend themselves and repelled the attacking Yan army, killing or wounding 24 of them. On the 18th, the 207th Regiment of the division, with more than 1,000 people, again invaded Chideng, Fancun, and Nanliang from Zhaoqu, and was also repelled by us. On the 19th, the 205th Regiment of the division again attacked our villages and towns of Qianfu, Lianli, and Qiaoli from Linfen, and seized more than ten carts of grain and captured six village cadres and five family members of village cadres in Qianfu Village, whose lives are still unknown.
