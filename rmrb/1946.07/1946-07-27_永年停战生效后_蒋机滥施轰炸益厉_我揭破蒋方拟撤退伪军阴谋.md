　　Following the Yongnian Truce
    Chiang Kai-shek's Planes Indiscriminately Bombed with Increased Ferocity
    We Exposed Chiang's Conspiracy to Withdraw Puppet Troops
    【Xinhua News Agency, Handan, 23rd】After the Yongnian Group announced the Yongnian truce took effect on June 30th, Kuomintang planes have intensified their attacks on peaceful residents outside Yongnian city. In the past half month, they dispatched planes 95 times, causing 38 casualties among residents, and strafed the Eighth Route Army outside the city. At the same time, they delivered operational plans and weapons and ammunition to the puppet troops in the city. From June 30th to July 6th, Chiang Kai-shek's planes landed in Yongnian city three times. Wang Yumin, the CCP representative of the Yongnian Group, submitted a memorandum to the Chiang Kai-shek and US representatives on the 17th, listing the facts and explaining that the Kuomintang's proposal to withdraw the Yongnian puppet troops was entirely a delaying tactic. In reality, they attempted to use these puppet troops as a supporting base within the Liberated Areas when launching a large-scale attack on the Pinghan Railway, in order to cooperate with the internal war operations of hundreds of thousands of Chiang Kai-shek's troops gathered in northern Henan.

　　永年停战生效后
    蒋机滥施轰炸益厉
    我揭破蒋方拟撤退伪军阴谋
    【新华社邯郸二十三日电】永年小组于六月三十日宣布永年停战生效后，国民党飞机袭击永年城外和平居民反更加紧，计半月来，出动飞机九十五次，居民伤亡三十八人，并扫射城外八路军。同时，却给城内伪军投送作战计划和武器弹药。六月三十日至七月六日，蒋机在永年城内先后降落三次。永年小组中共代表王豫民，十七日向蒋美两方代表提出备忘录，列举事实，说明国民党方面提出撤退永年伪军，全系缓兵之计，实际企图利用该伪军在作为大举进攻平汉路时，在解放区内部的策应基点，以配合集结豫北数十万蒋军的内战行动。
