Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: Moscow Dispatch: The newspaper *Izvestia*, in an article entitled "Grain and Politics," points out that Britain and the United States are using the European famine to achieve certain political goals. The article states: "The entire grain distribution mechanism is merely a tool of the British and Americans. Recently, the United States decided to grant conditional funding to UNRRA, with the aim of stopping the shipment of supplies to Byelorussia and Ukraine." The article strongly criticizes the food policy of the Anglo-American reactionary bloc as being, like the "atomic policy," a tool of political blackmail. The food policy directly supports reactionary groups in certain countries, such as the food relief to Greece, China, Spain, and Portugal. In 1945, Spain and Portugal received almost as much fat as the total amount allocated by UNRRA to twelve countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: Washington Dispatch: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Clayton opposes the resolution passed on the 13th by the U.S. House Appropriations Committee. According to this resolution, shipments of UNRRA supplies to the Soviet Union should be halted because the Soviet Union is allegedly preventing access to information about the distribution of UNRRA supplies. Clayton stated: "We have ample evidence to show that the Soviet Union is not, in fact, restricting attempts to obtain information regarding the distribution of UNRRA supplies. UNRRA personnel in the Byelorussian and Ukrainian regions are free to travel and inspect throughout the country and make reports without any interference." Clayton believes that this resolution of the U.S. House of Representatives implies using relief supplies to achieve political goals and is a threat to winning cooperation. The director of the UNRRA branch office in Ukraine, Macduffee (an American), also recently protested the allegation that the Soviet Union prohibits free access for inspection.

　　美英趁火打劫
    利用欧洲粮荒施行政治讹诈
    【新华社延安十四日电】莫斯科讯：消息报以《粮食与政治》为题，指出英美利用欧洲粮荒以达到他们某些政治目的。该文指出：“整个粮食分配的机构，不过是英美的工具，最近美国决定有条件的拨款给联总，目的就是停止向白俄罗斯与乌克兰运送的物资”。该文力斥英美反动集团之粮食政策与“原子政策”一样，同为政治讹诈之工具。用粮食政策直接支持某些国家的反动集团，例如对希腊、中、西、葡的粮食救济。一九四五年西、葡接到的脂肪，几乎与联总拨给十二个国家的总数相等。
    【新华社延安十五日电】华盛顿讯：美助理国务卿克莱敦反对美众院拨款委员会十三日通过之决议。按该决议污蔑苏联禁止采访联总物资分布情况，应停止联总物资运苏。克莱敦称：我们有充分证据，说明苏联在事实上并非束缚关于联总分配物资消息之企图。联总在白俄罗斯与乌克兰两地区之美籍工作人员，均得自由在该国各处旅行视察及作成报告而不受任何干涉。克氏认为美众院此一决议，含有利用救济物资实现政治目的的意味，而对争取合作是一种威胁。按联总驻乌兰联总分署主任麦克杜菲（美人），日前对污蔑苏联禁止自由采访之说，亦曾提出抗议。
