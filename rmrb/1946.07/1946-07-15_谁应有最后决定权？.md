　　Who Should Have the Final Say?
　　Xing Zhaotang
    The peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have become increasingly complex and absurd due to the Kuomintang's lack of sincerity, leading to endless complications. Recently, the Kuomintang government has repeatedly claimed that the U.S. representative has the final say in the KMT-CPC negotiations. Can this be considered the words of a dignified Chinese government? China is neither a colony of the United States, nor has it surrendered unconditionally to the United States. Why should the U.S. representative have the final say on China's internal affairs? China is the China of the Chinese people, not the China of a certain party or group. If neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party can represent the will of the entire Chinese people, then neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party is qualified to have the final say, let alone the U.S. representative! Unless one considers oneself an autocratic emperor and views the issue like an ordinary person, one should know that the real final say rests not with the U.S. representative, nor with any party or group, but with all the people of the Republic of China.
    The matter should be clarified. Ignoring the Chinese people and having a few bigwigs sitting on sofas arbitrarily deciding on a final say will never solve the problem.
    During the more than eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people disregarded all sacrifices and fought bravely against the Japanese fascist invaders, fully demonstrating their love for their country and respect for their sovereignty. Anyone who tries to deceive the Chinese people, engage in private deals, and treat China's territorial sovereignty as a commodity on the black market for secret exchanges in order to get rich is simply too foolish! If treason were so easy, then ancient traitors like Qin Hui and Shi Jingtang would have long become "traitor saints," leaving no room for the likes of Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek to shine!
    The Chinese people believe that only peace, democracy, and production and construction are the only way to strive for their own liberation. For more than half a year, various democratic parties have been running around and appealing for the reorganization of the National Government, the abolition of the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, the establishment of a coalition government, and the implementation of democratic reforms. Recently, Mr. Mao Zedong's serious statement opposing the U.S. imperialist elements' assistance to Chiang in the civil war represents the common will of all Chinese people, not the private interests of a single party. Chiang Kai-shek cannot see the Chinese people and only relies on the military assistance of U.S. imperialist elements, intending to turn China's territory into a colony of the United States and its people into slaves of the United States. Close your eyes and think, can the Chinese people bow their heads and silently allow him to sell them out?
    It has become an undeniable fact that Chiang Kai-shek has gained power by relying on the fostering and cultivation of imperialists. People only need to look back at his style to see enough. From the "September 18th" Incident to the Japanese surrender, what were Chiang Kai-shek's achievements in resisting Japan? The Northeast was occupied for more than ten years, and we never heard Chiang Kai-shek demand the recovery of sovereignty from the Japanese invaders; the large number of traitors and puppet troops aroused popular resentment, and we never heard Chiang Kai-shek say a single word against it. But after the Japanese surrender, Chiang Kai-shek strutted around, immediately mobilizing U.S.-equipped land, sea, and air forces, and loudly boasting that he would "take over sovereignty" from the anti-Japanese people in the Northeast. He ordered the incorporation of puppet troops and appointed traitors, wanting to "recover lost territory" from the democratic regimes in the liberated areas. This set of absurd "military and political plans" is Chiang Kai-shek's most skillful masterpiece. In the past, it was performed for the Japanese fascists, and now it is performed for the U.S. imperialist elements. Facts prove that without the support of imperialist elements, Chiang Kai-shek would become a soulless corpse. Could he still be able to wreak havoc in the world?
    Currently, it is precisely because of the U.S. imperialist elements' aid to Chiang that the situation of the Chinese civil war is becoming increasingly dangerous. However, the Chinese people believe that the advanced people and the vast majority of the people of the United States will never sit idly by and watch the U.S. imperialist elements collude with the traitorous villains of China, dragging the two great nations of China and the United States into the abyss of war without being able to extricate themselves. President Truman's statement supporting peace and democracy in China, withdrawing U.S. troops stationed in China, and not interfering in China's internal affairs, as well as the announcement of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, will never be used as a deceptive trick like Chiang Kai-shek's four promises. If President Truman is the same as Chiang Kai-shek, then the international credibility of the United States will be declared bankrupt due to President Truman's lies!
    The Chinese people, both in the past and now, are fighting for peace, democracy, independence, and freedom, not for opposing Eastern imperialism and then welcoming Western imperialism. In short, if Chiang Kai-shek does not talk about peace and democracy, but relies solely on external forces to expand the civil war, undermine peace, insist on dictatorship, and sell out China's territorial sovereignty, then the Chinese people can only exercise their own final say, rise up to defend themselves, and fight to the end!

### 谁应有最后决定权？

　　谁应有最后决定权？
　　邢肇棠
    国共两党的和平谈判，由于国民党毫无诚意，以致枝节横生，越谈越复杂，越谈越不像话了。最近据国民党政府一再声称，关于国共谈判美方代表有最后决定权，这能算是堂堂的中国政府说的话么？中国既不是美国的殖民地，又没有向美国无条件投降，美方代表对中国内政问题，为什么能有最后决定权呢？中国是中国人民之中国，并非某一个党派或某一个集团之中国，如国共两党没有一方能代表中国全体人民之意志，则国共两党也没有资格获得最后决定权，何况美方代表！人要不把自己当作是专制皇帝，和平凡人一样看问题，那么，就应该知道真正有最后决定权的不是美方代表，也不是什么党派或集团，而是中华民国之全体人民。
    把事情应该弄明白，忽视了中国人民，由几个大人先生们坐在沙发上武断的决定一个最后决定权，那是永远不能解决问题的。
    中国人民，在八年多的抗日战争中，不顾一切牺牲，与日本法西斯侵略者英勇战斗，已经充分证明其如何爱护他的国家，如何尊重他的主权；谁想瞒着中国人民，私相授受，把中国的领土主权，当作黑市上的商品，偷偷摸摸的交换一下，就可发财致富，那他未免太愚！卖国的勾当，如果那样容易则秦桧、石敬塘等类的古汉奸早都成了“奸圣”，岂有汪精卫、蒋介石等放光的余地！
    中国人民认为只有和平民主，生产建设，才是争取自身解放的唯一途径。多半年来，各民主党派之奔走呼号，要求改组国民政府，取消国民党一党专政，成立联合政府，实行民主改革，及最近毛泽东先生反对美帝国主义分子助蒋内战的严重声明，都是代表着全中国人民的共同意志，而非代表着一个党派之私利。蒋介石看不见中国人民，只依靠美帝国主义分子的军事援助，居心要把中国之领土变成美国的殖民地，人民变成美国的奴隶。请闭着眼睛想一想，中国人民能不能俯首贴耳，不声不响的听任其出卖呢？
    蒋介石依靠帝国主义的豢养栽培而得势，已成有目共睹的事实，人们随便回顾一下他的作风就够了。从“九一八”事变到日本投降，蒋介石的抗日成绩是什么？东北沦陷十余年，从来没有听见过蒋介石要从日寇手中接收主权之声息；大批投敌的汉奸伪军，闹得天怒人怨，从来没有听见蒋介石说过一句不对。但到日寇投降后，蒋介石却耀武扬威，立即动员美械化的陆海空军，大吹大擂，要向东北的抗日人民手中“接收主权”。命令收编伪军，任命汉奸，要向解放区的民主政权“收复失地”。这一套荒谬绝伦的“军政大计”，便是蒋介石最热练的精彩杰作。过去是演给日本法西斯分子看的，现在又是演给美国帝国主义分子看的。事实证明，蒋介石没有帝国主义分子撑腰，他就会变成没有灵魂的僵尸，还能在人间作祟么？
    目前正因为美帝国主义分子的援蒋政策，致使中国内战形势日趋险恶，但中国人民相信，美国的先进人士和绝大多数人民，决不能坐视美国的帝国主义分子与中国的卖国奸徒狼狈为奸，把中美两大民族拖到战争的深渊而不自拔。杜鲁门总统支持中国和平民主，撤离驻华美军，不干涉中国内政的声明，以及莫斯科三国外长会议的公告，决不会和蒋介石的四项诺言一样作为骗人的伎俩。假若杜鲁门总统也和蒋介石一样，则美国的国际信誉，将因杜鲁门总统的撒谎而宣告破产！
    中国人民，无论过去和现在，都是为了和平、民主、独立、自由而战斗，并不是为了反对东帝国主义、再欢迎西帝国主义而战斗。总而言之，蒋介石如不讲和平民主，专恃外力扩大内战，破坏和平，坚持独裁，出卖中国之领土主权，则中国人民，只有执行自己的最后决定权起而自卫，奋斗到底！
