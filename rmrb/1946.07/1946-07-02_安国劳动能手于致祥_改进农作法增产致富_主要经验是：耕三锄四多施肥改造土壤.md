Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 24th - Yu Zhixiang, a production model worker in An'guo, has enthusiastically researched and improved farming methods year by year, resulting in a significant increase in crop yields. Among the main crops he cultivates, the average wheat yield per mu (Chinese acre) at the beginning of the War of Resistance was 220 kg, now increased to 285 kg; barley increased from 220 kg per mu to 325 kg; millet increased from 280 kg per mu to 320 kg, almost doubling the yield of average farmers. His fifteen mu of paddy fields yielded a total harvest of 11,200 kg in 1944, which increased to 12,850 kg last year, and he plans to increase production by another 5,000 kg this year. Yu Zhixiang has developed from a poor farmer who lacked food and clothing before the War of Resistance into a prosperous farmer employing one long-term worker, owning a plowing donkey and an irrigation machine. Yu Zhixiang has accumulated the following experience from the practice of improving farming: (1) "Plow three times, hoe four times." Autumn plowing is particularly important; if it is too late, the soil fertility will not easily recover, and moisture cannot be fully conserved. The secret of hoeing is "thorough hoeing the first time (carefully weeding around the seedlings), deep hoeing the second time (deep hoeing makes it easier for seedlings to take root), good hoeing the third time (not only deep hoeing, but also piling soil around the roots of the crops), and quick hoeing the fourth time (shallow hoeing to loosen the soil)." (2) Fertilization. This year, Yu Zhixiang applied an average of 18,200 kg of fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, focusing on application before sowing; late fertilization can easily lead to diseases and insect pests. For making fertilizer, he uses chopped wheat straw and soil in the pigsty, mixed with pig excrement, to become an excellent organic fertilizer, which can also help to loosen the soil and increase soil temperature. (3) Soil improvement. Yu Zhixiang's fifteen mu of irrigated land was originally a sandy loam. After several years of repeatedly turning over and adding yellow soil, and digging a well, it has now become fertile farmland created artificially.

　　安国劳动能手于致祥
    改进农作法增产致富
    主要经验是：耕三锄四多施肥改造土壤
    【新华社河间二十四日电】安国生产能手于致祥，逐年热心研究改进耕作法，产量已获飞跃提高。在他所作务的几种主要作物中，小麦抗战初每亩平均产量为二石二斗，现增至二石八斗五；大麦由每亩二石二斗，增至三石二斗五；谷由每亩二石八斗，增至三石二斗；超过一般农户产量将近一倍。他所经营的十五亩水田，民国三十三年总收获量为一百一十二石，去年增至一百二十八石五斗，今年尚准备增产五十石。现于致祥已由抗战前缺食短穿的贫农，发展成为雇用一个长工，有耕驴一头，水车一架的富农。于致祥从改良农作实践中积累有下列经验：（一）“耕三锄四”。尤以秋耕最为重要，过迟了地力不易恢复，水分不能充分含蓄。锄地的秘诀是“头遍真（仔细锄苗），二遍深（深了小苗容易扎根）。三遍好（不但深锄，还要把土培到作物根部），四遍跑（浅锄松润土质）。”（二）施肥。今年于致祥每亩耕地平均施肥一万八千二百斤，着重于播种前，上肥迟了则易罹病虫害。造肥则以碎的麦秸和土奶在猪圈内，混杂猪的排泄物成为极优良的有机肥料，并可附带使土质松软，地温增高。（三）改造土壤。于致祥的十五亩水浇地，原为一片沙壤，经他数年来屡次翻覆上黄色土，并开凿水井一口，现已成为人工造成肥沃良田。
