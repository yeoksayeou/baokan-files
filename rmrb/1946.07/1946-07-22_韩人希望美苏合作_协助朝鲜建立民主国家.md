　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: United Press International, Washington: Korean figures here are hoping that the United States and the Soviet Union can fully cooperate on the Korean issue in accordance with the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Agreement to assist Korea in eventually establishing a democratic nation. Because General Hodge, the commander of the US military in Korea, stubbornly supports reactionary factions such as Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee, violating the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Agreement, the work of the US-Soviet Joint Commission in Korea has been stalled. Korean residents in Washington commented on this: "If it were not for the stubbornness of some leaders of the US occupying forces, the negotiations between the Soviet and US military authorities in Korea in May would not have broken down." The results of a poll of Koreans in the United States show that the majority demand US-Soviet cooperation.
