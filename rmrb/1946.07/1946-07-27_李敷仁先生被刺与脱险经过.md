Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: This reporter visited Mr. Li Furen, an important leader of the China Democratic League's Northwest General Branch, who came to Yan'an to seek refuge, and asked about the assassination attempt and his escape. Mr. Li was wearing a gray cloth uniform, his face was dark and slightly thin, his head was slightly balding, he looked like a simple old farmer, and his demeanor was like that of a private school teacher. He said: "Around 9 a.m. on May 1st (the day after Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Xi'an from Chongqing), I was returning from visiting a friend. I passed through Nan Yuan Men and walked to my residence at the People's Education Hall. On the way, I reached the entrance of the Provincial Library when I saw a large car parked there. Three or four secret agents swarmed forward and dragged me into the car. Two secret agents inside the car pulled out a blood-stained towel from the compartment and covered my eyes. At the same time, they used a leather belt to tightly strangle my throat, then pressed me down between the seat cushions. The car sped away. An hour later, it stopped by a ditch. Three executioners pulled me out of the car, cocked their guns. The first bullet flew over my head, and then the second shot into my back. I fell into the ditch. When I woke up from the stupor, I used my left hand to lift the towel covering my eyes and saw that I was on the soil of my hometown, Xianyang, which I knew so well..." Mr. Li continued: "That noon, a local farmer discovered that I was a newspaper publisher, and immediately gathered villagers to carry me to a nearby village and hide me quietly. The next day, four secret agents rushed from Xi'an and searched everywhere, but everyone was very protective of me. Two teams of elementary school students secretly came to see me. They said, 'Mr. Li, we will protect you.' The farmers also secretly prevented any information from leaking out. Every time they moved me to a new location, they secretly posted sentries during the day and guarded with guns at night. Therefore, despite the secret agents' painstaking efforts and layered encirclement, they were unable to find me. After more than a month of wandering, the Kuomintang secret agents did not relax their search. The people were afraid that I would fall into the tiger's mouth again, so they insisted on sending me to the safe Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region for refuge. With my consent, we traveled through seven counties and arrived in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region after many twists and turns. Initially, because the bullet was lodged in my neck, it caused constant pain. Fortunately, the local hospital performed surgery to remove the bullet. After a short period of recuperation, my health has been preliminarily restored." At this point, Mr. Li took out a small package from his pocket and showed the reporter a No. 2 revolver bullet stained with blood. The bullet had entered from Mr. Furen's back and stopped between the arteries and veins on the right side of his throat, without damaging the major blood vessels, and therefore he was fortunate not to be killed. Speaking of the current situation, Mr. Li expressed extreme indignation at this bloody case of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents assassinating democrats. He said: "From the 'December 1st' tragedy in Kunming to the present, the Kuomintang fascist faction's methods of treating democrats and young students have become increasingly despicable and degenerate, a thousand times worse than Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars. Speaking for myself, I have been engaged in education for twenty years. Is the reward for serving the Kuomintang educational institutions all these years a bullet?" Mr. Li finally said: "Although I have been forced to flee to Yan'an, the hearts of the people in the Northwest are still full of resentment. They hate the crimes of the fascist secret agents' rule. If the civil war does not stop and the secret agent rule is not abolished, the people's lives will never be peaceful."

　　李敷仁先生被刺与脱险经过
    【新华社延安二十四日电】记者于日前往访来延避难之民盟西北总支部重要负责人之一——李敷仁先生，叩询被刺与脱险经过。李先生身着灰布制服，面孔黧黑，略显消瘦，光头微发，状似朴实老农，举止宛如一塾师。他说：“五月一日（按即蒋介石由重庆到西安之次日）上午九时许，我从外访友归来，路经南院门，步行到民众教育馆寓所，途中走至省立图书馆门首，看见一辆大卧车停驻在那里，即有三四个特务蜂拥前来，将我架上汽车，车内早有两名特务从车箱内抽出一条染满血迹的毛巾将我两眼蒙住，同时用一条皮带紧紧勒住咽喉，然后按纳于车箱座垫中间，汽车即疾驶而去。一小时后，开到一条濠沟旁停了下来，三个刽子手将我从车内拉出，板动枪机，第一颗子弹从我头顶飞过，接着第二颗从背脊射进，我被击倒在濠沟里。等到从昏迷中醒转，用左手揭开蒙眼的毛巾一看，原来是在地形如此熟悉的我的家乡咸阳的土地上，…………”李先生继续说：“当天中午，当地一个农民发现我是办报的，就立刻约村人将我抬到附近村里，悄悄的隐蔽起来。第二天有四名特务从西安赶来，到处搜捕，但大家对我十分爱护，有两队小学生秘密跑来看我，他们说：‘李先生我们保卫你’。农民也秘密的不让漏走一点风声，每移一地，他们就为我白天暗中放哨，夜间持枪守卫。因此使特务们费尽心机，层层围剿，终于不能发现。流亡月余，国民党特务的搜捕毫不松手。老百姓怕我再落虎口，定要把我送到安全的陕甘宁边区来避难。经我同意后，路经七县，辗转来到陕甘宁边区。初因弹藏颈部，并时时作痛，幸蒙地方医院施行手术，将弹取出。经过短期疗养，健康已算初步恢复。”至此，李先生从衣袋内取出一小包，以一枪染着血迹的二号左轮手枪枪弹展示记者。该弹由敷仁先生背部穿入，在咽喉偏右两动静脉血管之间停滞，没有破坏大血管，因此幸未致命。谈起目前时局，李先生对于此次蒋介石特务实行暗杀民主人士的血案，极度愤慨，他说：“从昆明‘一二一’惨案到现在，国民党法西斯派对待民主人士和青年学生的手段，越来越卑鄙下流，比之秦始皇焚书坑儒更甚千倍。以我自己来说，从事教育二十年，难到这些年来为国民党教育机关服务的结果，报酬就是一颗枪弹么？”李先生最后表示：“我虽被迫流亡到延安，但西北老百姓的心仍然是愤恨的，他们痛恨法西斯特务的罪恶统治，如内战不停止，特务统治不取消，人民生活将永无宁日。”
