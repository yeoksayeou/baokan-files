　　The Qingdao Executive Headquarters Branch Provided Relief to Families of Party and Government Officials
　　The Executive Headquarters Embezzled and Pocketed Relief Supplies Transported to Zhangjiakou

　　[This newspaper reports] The Qingdao Executive Headquarters Branch distributed a large quantity of United Nations relief supplies to the families of local Kuomintang government officials and to illegal government personnel without people or land. Most of the relief supplies received by the branch fell into the hands of its staff, so the people of Qingdao call it the "Relief Headquarters itself".
　　[Another report] In May, 185 tons of relief supplies were transported to Zhangjiakou by the Executive Headquarters. Personnel from the Jin-Cha-Ji Relief Branch of our Liberated Area inspected and counted them on the spot and found the discrepancies to be shocking. For example, out of 2,000 bags of flour, only 1,284 bags were actually received, and all had been replaced with inedible black flour. Out of 200 packages of shoes and socks, only 153 packages were actually received, and out of 3,000 packages of old clothes, only 2,500 packages were actually received. The embezzlement and corruption of the Executive Headquarters personnel are evident.

　　联总救资那里去了？
    青岛行总分署救济了党官家属
    运我张市救资行总贪污中饱
    【本报讯】青岛行总分署，将联合国救济物资，大批发放于当地国民党政府机关家属，及没有人民和土地的非法政府人员手里。该署所收得之救济物资大部落入该署工作人员之手，故青岛人民呼之为“救济本署”。
    【又讯】五月份经行总运送张家口之一八五吨救济物资，我解放区晋察冀救济分会人员当场点收，差数惊人。如面粉二千袋，仅实收一千二百八十四袋，均被换成不能吃的黑面。鞋袜二百包，只实收一百五十三包，旧衣三千包，只实收二千五百包。行总人员贪污中饱，真象可见。
