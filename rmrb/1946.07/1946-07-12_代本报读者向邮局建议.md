On behalf of our readers, suggestions to the Post Office

Since the founding of this newspaper, we have constantly received letters from readers and the general public, questioning why the newspaper is distributed so slowly. When we saw a reader write, "Looking forward to it, extremely anxious," we are grateful to the kind readers for their concern for this newspaper, and we also feel extremely anxious. Originally, the newspaper distribution and mailing system is handled by the post office, and readers could have directly inquired with the post office; however, because most readers do not understand the situation, they have to write to the newspaper office. In order to improve the work of newspaper distribution and mail delivery, we have summarized the readers' opinions and added some of our own, for the reference of the post office and related parties:

The main opinions of readers are four: First, too slow. From Handan to Xingtai, it took seven or eight days in May. Later, there were some improvements, but now it still takes four to five days. It is still often delivered two or three issues at a time, and sometimes one or two issues are missing in a month. Wu'an is only sixty miles from Handan, but a reader in Handan wrote, "We usually see the newspaper here three days later, and sometimes three issues come at once. There are protests everywhere." Leader × also wrote to talk about this issue: "We cannot see the newspaper on time. Sometimes the tenth newspaper arrives earlier than the eighth or ninth newspaper." The Handan Xinhua Bookstore sent several bundles of books to the Suobao branch in early April, and it took forty days. It is said that sometimes, it is necessary to wait for several issues of newspapers to be collected into a large truck before they can be transported together. The Taihang Post Office's delivery of Taihang newspapers is better, and we can receive Taihang newspapers on time, but this newspaper to Taihang is the same as the above slow situation, I don't know why.

Second, sometimes it is lost. Several issues of the newspaper are missing and never come, which means they are lost. When the newspaper office writes letters to the outside world, the recipient receives the second letter but not the first, which of course is also lost. This has a great impact on the communication between this newspaper and all sectors of society, as well as the submissions to this newspaper.

Third, in the ×× area, individual post office staff members have the phenomenon of extracting and reading from books and newspapers. It is said that this is a serious violation of post office regulations, which has caused the greatest dissatisfaction among those who suffer losses.

Fourth, the post offices in the Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji'nan, and Taiyue regions have not yet been connected for remittances, which has not only greatly affected the financial market in the liberated areas, but also added a lot of inconvenience to enthusiastic newspaper subscribers and book buyers.

It must be affirmed that the merits of the liberated areas' post offices in the War of Resistance and in peaceful construction cannot be erased. The entire staff of the post office has shed a lot of sweat and blood for this. Today, the lives of postal workers are still extremely difficult, transportation is extremely lacking, and the staff and even the leadership are not yet proficient in this specialized business... However, many things that can and should be done do not seem to have been resolved in a timely and bold manner. For example, before June, newspapers and mail from Handan to Xingtai had to go around a circle of Wu'an and Yangyi, and from Handan to Cixian, they had to be transferred from Wu'an and Pengcheng. This not only delayed a lot of time, but also wasted a lot of manpower in the post office itself. Following this route, it would take an extra 120 miles to go from Handan to Xingtai. (After June, it has been changed to direct, which is of course very good.) As for not losing mail and not extracting mail, these are relatively easy to implement and must be implemented. The issue of remittance connections in Ji-Lu-Yu and other regions should also catch up with Taihang and be resolved quickly.

For our liberated areas' post offices, we do not want to and dare not "demand perfection," but the facts are so serious, we can only hope that the post office can immediately refer to everyone's opinions for research and improvement, and do its work better. We hope that the general public will offer more suggestions and assistance to the post office. We hope that relevant parties will check and supervise at any time, and provide the post office with some specific solutions to difficulties. We deeply feel that if this continues, not only will this newspaper lose its timeliness and political nature, but also the various cultural undertakings and correspondence in the liberated areas will be greatly affected. We have made suggestions to the postal authorities and relevant parties, but the basic improvements are still not great. Therefore, we once again make suggestions, hoping that the post office and relevant parties will check and discuss them. We believe that in the face of such a serious situation, we should further find solutions!

### 代本报读者向邮局建议

　　代本报读者向邮局建议
    自从本报创刊以来，一直不断的接到读者和广大社会人士的意见书，质问报纸为什么发行这么慢。当我们看到一位读者写到：“望眼欲穿，焦烦至再”的时候，我们感激好心的读者爱护本报的盛意，我们因此也感到极大的焦急。本来报纸发行寄递系统由邮局办理，读者原可迳向邮局询问；但因大部读者不了解其中情况，乃不得不纷向报馆投书。为了把报纸发行、邮件寄递的工作作得更好一些，特将读者意见简括汇集一下，并附带我们自己一些意见，以供邮局及有关方面参考：
    读者意见主要有四：第一、太慢，本报由邯郸到邢台，五月份得七八天，以后有了一些改进，到现在还得四天至五天，还是常常两三期一并送到，有时一个月缺少一两期。武安到邯郸不过六十里，但有一位邯郸的读者来信说：“这里看报大抵在三天以后，有时一来三期。弄得到处抗议声”。×首长也来信谈到这个问题：“不能按期按时看到报纸，有时侯十号的报纸却比八九号的报纸早到了”。邯郸新华书店在四月初给索堡门市部发了几捆书，结果走了四十天。据说还有些时候，要等几期报纸凑足一大车才能一起运去。太行邮局对于太行报纸的邮递是较好的，我们可以按期收到太行报，但本报到太行则与以上迟慢情形一样，不知何故。
    第二、有时候还丢掉。报纸缺几期永不见来，是丢了。报馆向外写信，收信者接到第二封却未接到第一封，当然也是丢了。这对本报与各界来往及本报来稿，影响极大。
    第三、在××区，个别邮局人员有从书报邮件中抽取阅读的现象。据说这是非常违犯邮局规章的，引起受损失者最大的不满。
    第四、冀鲁豫、冀南、太岳三区的邮局还未通汇，这不但使解放区的金融市场受了极大的影响，且给热心的订报、购书者增加许多的不便。
    必须肯定解放区的邮局在抗战中、在和平建设上的功绩是绝对不能抹灭的。邮局的全体职工曾因此流了大量的汗与血。在今天，邮工同志们的生活还极艰苦，交通工具异常缺乏，职员们以至领导上对于这种专门业务还不够熟练……但是，有许多能作应作的事情，似乎还并没有及时而大胆的解决。例如，在六月份以前从邯郸到邢台的报纸邮件，要绕一个武安、阳邑的圈子，从邯郸到磁县，要由武安、彭城转过去。这么一来不但迟缓了很多时间，而且也浪费邮局本身许多人力，照这个路线走下去，从邯郸到邢台要白走一百二十里。（六月份以后已改为直达，这当然是很好的），至于像不丢邮件，不抽取邮件，都是比较易行且必须实行的。冀鲁豫等区的通汇问题，也应该赶上太行，迅速解决。
    对于我们解放区的邮局，我们并不愿与不敢“求全责备”，但是，事实竟至如此严重，我们唯有希望邮局方面能即时参照大家意见研究改进，把自己的工作作得更好。我们希望广大社会人士对邮局多多建议，多方帮助。我们希望有关方面随时检查督促，并给邮局解决一些具体困难。我们深切感到如此下去，不仅本报将失去新闻性与政治性，而且解放区各种文化事业和来往信件，将受到极大的影响，我们已向邮政当局及有关方面提过建议了，但基本的改进依然不大，因之，我们再一次提出建议，希望邮局及有关方面加以检查与讨论，我们认为面对着如此严重情况似应进一步想办法了！
