[Our Newspaper Yangcheng News] The vigorous anti-traitor and revenge movement of the masses in Jiang County's urban area erupted on the sixteenth day after liberation (the 5th of this month). The local masses had lived through seven years of muted suffering under the bloody rule of the enemy and puppets. After the Japanese surrender, they fell into the bloody hands of Chen Ziwen's puppet army, which was fully supported by the Chiang-Yan troops, enduring doubled brutality, slaughter, and oppression for ten months. During Chen's occupation of Jiang County, he massacred 3,000 innocent people. From September to December of last year alone, more than 220 civilian laborers conscripted to build fortifications were killed, beaten to death, exhausted to death, or starved and frozen to death. The masses suppressed their strong resentment, waiting for the day when they could avenge this deep blood feud, and that day was finally brought by the Eighth Route Army. On the 5th of this month, more than 10,000 people shouted violent revenge slogans for the first time, gathering to accuse the captured Cao Tianxiang, head of the puppet assassination squad, Liu Weilian, deputy battalion commander of the puppet Zhiwei Camp, Zhang Fuzhen, puppet district chief of the first district, Yao Jun'e, puppet district chief of the second district, and Xue Chenglin, chief of puppet errands of the third district, of their heinous crimes. Wu Shengcai, a poor city resident, hobbled to Liu Weilian on crutches, weeping and demanding the return of her murdered son. A low sob filled the black mass of people. An old woman from Chen Village cried out in anguish because two of her relatives had been killed for no reason: "What crime have the common people committed!" Some people angrily pointed at the traitors, wanting to tell of their grievances, but were choked by uncontrollable crying, unable to say a word. Only a few words burst out: "You inhuman things!" The masses were filled with indignation, demanding immediate execution. The government accepted the opinions of the masses, announced the death penalty for the five traitors, and immediately carried out the execution by firing squad.

　　绛县反奸迅速开展
    万人伸报血海深仇
    【本报阳城讯】绛县城区群众轰轰烈烈的反奸复仇运动，已于解放后第十六日（本月五日）爆发。该地群众过去在敌伪血腥统治下吞声饮泪过了七年，复于日寇投降后堕入蒋阎军所全力支持的伪军陈子文部血手，忍受加倍残暴的屠杀与压榨达十月之久。陈部在盘据绛县期中，屠杀无辜群众达三千人。仅去年九月至十二月，被强征修堡之民夫，即有二百二十余人被杀死、打死、累死及冻饿至死。群众压抑着强烈的怨愤之火，等待着总有一天能报此血海深仇，而这一天终于由八路军给带来了。本月五日，一万多群众第一次喊出暴烈的复仇口号，集会控诉被捕获的伪暗杀团长曹天祥、伪致卫营营副刘维廉、一区伪区长张福祯、二区伪区长姚俊峨、三区伪差务主任薛成林等五逆的滔天罪恶。贫苦市民吴生财的老婆柱着拐杖，挤到刘维廉跟前，痛哭着向他讨要被害的儿子时，黑压压的人群里弥漫着虚虚啜泣之声。陈村一个老太太因自己两个亲人被无故杀害而痛极哭喊：“老百姓究竟犯了什么罪呀！”有的人用手怒指着汉奸，要诉说自己的冤苦，却被不能自禁的哭声哽住，一句也说不出来。只迸出几个字：“你们这些没人性的东西！”群众情绪愤激，纷纷要求当场枪毙，政府接受群众意见，宣布了该五逆死刑，当场执行枪决。
