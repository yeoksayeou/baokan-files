Song of Blood and Tears of Stone Embankment Peasants
    Lì Shēng

　　During our work in understanding the Stone Embankment area this time, we discovered a lot of peasant poetry material, unfinished harmonious poetic phrases. The content of these poems all reflect the stories of blood and tears of peasants suffering from the oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords; they expose the atrocities committed by the Liú Wéi landlord (a landlord who was a traitor to the Han) against the peasants over the years. Please see the following:

　　"Planting Liú's fields,
　　Husband and wife not reunited,
　　Children also sold,
　　Falling to begging."

　　The story comes from Wáng Cǎo'ān. There was a tenant farmer named Mǎi Fúyǒu who farmed Liú's land; the rent was too heavy, he couldn't pay it, and he borrowed high-interest loans from Liú's family (30% interest in spring, 10% in summer, 20% in autumn, and 15% in winter). He rolled his only two acres of land to Liú's family; his three thatched houses were also demolished, and finally his wife was forced to remarry and his son was sold. He ended up begging. The peasants all compiled this story into a ballad:

　　"Hearing Liú's family call to change land,
　　Adults cry,
　　Children shout."

　　Changing land is when the landlord (or under the pretext of other stories) performs a land changing procedure when the tenant's landlord transfers the land. Each time the land is changed, the tenant has to spend money on treating guests, etc. This is a very heavy extra extortion and exploitation. The tenants are very afraid when they hear that the land is being changed, especially when Liú's family comes to change the land.

　　"Chicken, fish, gluten, eggs,
　　Even thunder cannot scatter them!"

　　"Chicken, fish, gluten, eggs,
　　Collect rent in the thousands;
　　Get out, no food to eat,
　　The table is scattered out!"

　　Every year when the landlord comes to the countryside to check the rent, the tenants must entertain them with eight dishes of wine and food. Chicken, duck, and fish are indispensable. When eating duck, it must be a fat duck, and it must weigh three and a half pounds. If it's only half a duck, they won't eat it. The tenant has to hold the duck in front of the landlord before killing it, and only after the landlord nods can they dare to kill it. If the wine and food are not eaten well, they will smash bowls and tables.

　　"Taking a trip to Liú Wéi,
　　Calf muscles tremble;
　　Going up, a dog bites,
　　Large peck and large bushel again."

　　There are two things peasants fear when going to the Liú Wéi landlord's house: one is the fierce dog, and the other is the use of pecks and bushels of larger size. Usually, a peck here is fifteen catties, but Liú's specially made peck is twenty catties. The loss suffered by the peasants every year when paying rent is too great, so the peasants' calf muscles tremble in fear when they go to Liú Wéi.

　　There are still many tragic stories of landlords oppressing peasants that have not yet formed into poems. I will first briefly introduce the story and then try to compile it into a poem.

　　(1) There was an old Yang San who herded ducks. The ducks he herded ran into Liú's rice fields. Liú's family said that Yang San's ducks ate his rice, so they blocked the ducks into the gate of the fortress. The fierce dogs inside bit them badly. Old Yang San knelt outside the gate of the fortress, kowtowing and begging for a whole day, but Liú paid no attention to him. So old Yang San had no choice but to hang himself in the waterwheel shed. Liú's family spent 200 cash to settle the matter.

　　Old Yang San, herding ducks,
　　Ducks driven to Liú's fields,
　　Liú, having an unkind heart,
　　Strongly saying the ducks ate rice fields;
　　Blocking the ducks, the gate of the fortress is closed,
　　Old Yang San outside the gate,
　　Kneeling and kowtowing, begging for a whole day.
　　Liú ignores him,
　　Yang San cries helplessly,
　　Hanging himself in the shed, his life is over.

　　(2) Every year, most of the transplanting here is done by women, and women often bring their children with them when transplanting. They are worried about leaving their children at home, but when transplanting at Liú's house, they are not allowed to bring children, firstly because they are afraid that the children will eat white rice, and secondly because they are afraid of delaying the transplanting. One year, a woman who came to Liú's house to transplant brought her child. While transplanting, the child accidentally fell into the water. The child's mother was anxious to rescue him, but the Liú landlord did not allow it. Liú even scolded her, saying, "Who told you to bring your child?" Even if he drowns, giving you money won't set a precedent for bringing children. The child drowned alive like that! 200 cash can be spent, but the precedent of bringing children to transplant cannot be set in Liú's house.

　　"Transplanting Liú's seedlings,
　　The child's life is not long;
　　Bringing children to transplant,
　　The rice field cannot be let go.
　　The child falls into the water,
　　Liú beats the mother's leg;
　　The mother cries on the shore,
　　The child's life is gone."

　　(3) When Liú's family collects rent, in addition to using specially made large pecks and large bushels, they also do not allow there to be soil in the grain. They must use a winnowing fan to winnow it. Naturally, the empty grains and soil are winnowed clean, but inevitably there are small soil particles. At this time, the tenants must kneel on the ground to pick them clean. Under the landlord's repeated manipulations, the grain brought by the tenants is often not enough. If it's not enough, it won't do. Scolding is a small matter, or they will be locked in the earthen prison in the house. If there is any surplus after paying the rent, don't even think about taking it home.

　　Going to pay Liú's rent,
　　Guts and heart are weak;
　　Large peck and large bushel are not enough,
　　Kneeling on the ground to pick after winnowing.
　　More belongs to Liú,
　　Less is made up by oneself;
　　If the rent is owed and cannot be paid;
　　Go to suffer in the earthen prison!

　　(4) Liú's family widely lends high-interest loans in the surrounding villages. The interest is very heavy. The most common is "30% interest in spring, 10% in summer, 20% in autumn, and 15% in winter," with interest calculated quarterly. If it is not paid off in time, the interest turns into principal and continues to roll over. After two years of rolling over, the peasants' fields and houses are all gone. The landlord has very good ways to collect debts. If three or two cents are owed and not paid, the peasant's bowl will be taken away and smashed when they go out. If it's more, the copper spoon will be taken away. If it's more, the pot will be taken away. When smashing bowls and taking pots, Liú's family says, "I can't not take your things away. This example cannot be set, otherwise it will be difficult to collect debts from other families."

　　Borrowing money from Liú's family,
　　All the fields and land are rolled away;
　　30% interest in spring, 10% in summer, 20% in autumn, and 15% in winter. Usury is more deadly than a tiger! If the interest cannot be repaid,
　　Take away the pot and spoon and smash the bowl;
　　He also says:
　　"If I don't smash the bowl,
　　How can I collect the debt?"

　　There are too many evil deeds of Liú Wéi's landlord exploiting the peasants, and too many lives have been forced to death. It's impossible to explain them all at once.

### 石塘农民血泪之歌

　　石塘农民血泪之歌
    力生
    这次我们在石塘区了解工作中，发现了很多农民诗歌的素材，未成形的诗的谐和句。这些诗的内容都是反映受封建地主压迫剥削农民的血泪故事；暴露出刘圩地主（有一当汉奸的地主）多少年来对农民的暴行。请看以下：
    “种了刘家田，
    夫妻不团圆，
    伢子也卖掉，
    落得去讨饭。”
    故事出自王草庵，有个佃户叫买福友，种刘家田；租太重，交不起，又借了刘家高利贷，（春三夏一二冬秋一五）把谨有二亩田滚给了刘家；三间草房也被拆掉，最后妻子被逼改嫁，儿子也卖了；弄得他最后讨饭。农民们都把这故事编为歌谣：
    “听到刘家叫换地，
    大人哭，
    孩子喊。”
    换地是佃户的地主主人将田转手时“或借口其他故事）要进行一下换地的手续。换一次地，佃户要花一回钱请客等。这是很重的额外敲榨性剥削，佃户们一听到换地，特别是刘家来换地，真是怕的很。
    “鸡鱼面筋蛋，
    雷打都不散！”
    “鸡鱼面筋蛋，
    收租千千万；
    滚蛋不吃饭，
    桌子往外散！”
    在每年地主下乡看租时候，佃户必须八大样酒饭招待，鸡鸭鱼肉少不了，吃鸭一定要肥鸭子，而且一定三斤半重，半边鸭子不吃，佃户在杀鸭之前端在地主面前称了，地主点头后，才敢拿去杀。酒饭吃得不好摔碗砸桌子。
    “朝刘圩一走，
    腿肚子发抖；
    上去狗咬一口，
    大斛又是大斗。
    农民上刘圩地主家去有两怕：一是怕连起恶狗，更怕不斛大斗，通常此地斗十五斤，刘家特制斗是二十斤，每年交租，农民受的损失太大了，所以农民一朝刘圩走时，腿肚子吓得抖的。
    还有很多地主压迫农民的悲惨故事尚未形成诗歌，我先把故事简单介绍一下然后试编为诗。
    （１）以前有个放鸭子的老杨三，他放的鸭子跑到了刘家稻田里，刘家大人，说杨三的鸭子吃他稻了，便把鸭子拦到圩门里去，里面恶狗很咬，老杨三跪在圩门外叩头哀求一天，刘大人丝毫不睬，于是老杨三没办法，他便在水车棚子里上吊死了，刘家花一吊二百钱了事。
    老杨三，放鸭子，
    鸭子赶到刘家田，
    刘大人，心不端，
    强说鸭子吃稻田；
    拦走鸭子圩门关，
    圩门外老杨三，
    跪着磕头求一天。
    刘大人全不理，
    杨三无奈哭涟涟，
    车棚上吊一命完。
    （２）此地每年栽秧，多是妇女，而妇女来栽秧时，也常带着小孩子来，小孩子丢家不放心，可是在刘家栽秧，不准带小孩子来的，一来怕小孩吃白饭，二怕耽误栽秧。有一年一个来到刘家栽秧的妇女，把孩子带了来，正在栽秧中间，这孩子失足落水，小孩子妈急着要去捞救，刘家地主不许，刘家还熊她，谁叫你带孩子来？就是淹死了给你钱，也不能开带伢子来的例，活生生的孩子，就这么淹死了！一吊二百钱可以花，带孩子来栽秧的例在刘家是不能开的。
    “栽了刘家秧。
    孩子命不长；
    带伢去栽秧，
    秧田不能放。
    伢子落下水，
    刘家打娘腿；
    娘在岸上哭，
    伢子命鸣呼。
    （３）刘家收租时候，除了用特制的，大斗大斛收以外，还不许粮食里有土，要用风车来扬，自然空谷子和土都扬净而外，难免有小土粒子，这时要佃户跪在地检干净；佃户在主人七弄八弄之下，往往带去粮食总是不够头，不够头便不行，骂还小事，或者关在家里的土牢里。要是交租还余一些，也别想带回家去。
    去缴刘家租，
    胆载心又酥；
    斛大大斗还不算，
    风车簸后跪地拣。
    多了归刘家，
    少了自己补；
    租子欠下缴不上；
    土牢里头去受苦！
    （４）刘家在四乡是广放高利贷的，利息是很重，最普遍的是什么“春三夏一秋二冬一五”按季计息，春季三个月，利息是百分之三十，夏季百分之十，余类推，到时还不清，利变本继续滚下去，两年一滚，农民产田房屋便滚光了，地主要账是很有办法，欠三两个钱不还便把农民的碗拿走，出门便掼了，再多些，把铜勺拿走，再多些把锅提走，刘家在掼碗提锅时说，我不能不拿你家的东西走，这例子是不能开的，不然别家的账就不好要了。
    借了刘家钱，
    田地都滚完；
    春三夏一秋二冬一五吆人利贷要命赛老虎！要是利钱不能还，
    提走锅勺把碗掼；
    他还说：
    “不掼碗
    要账怎么还”？
    关于刘圩地主剥削农民的恶行太多了，逼死的人命也太多了，一时也说不清。
