Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 14th. The puppet troops in Duowu Town, 30 li south of Xuangang, were disarmed by the Eighth Route Army on the 8th.

Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 14th. On the morning of the 12th, the Jin-Sui Eighth Route Army disarmed the puppet troops in Guoxian. Yan's puppet 40th Division, 2nd Regiment, the Ai Xiang (Love the Village) Brigade, the Special Service Battalion, the "Soldiers and Farmers United" Pioneer Regiment, and a unit of the Japanese army, totaling more than 2,000 men, were completely annihilated except for a few who escaped. According to preliminary statistics, more than 800 puppet soldiers and 12 Japanese soldiers were captured, and a large number of weapons were seized. Yan's 40th Division, 2nd Regiment, was originally the puppet Provincial Defense Army 4th Division Commander, Qin Liangxiang, who then served as the puppet Provincial Defense Army 4th Division Commander. This time, at the request of the people, the Eighth Route Army began to attack the puppet army on the evening of the 11th. The puppet army stubbornly resisted by relying on solid fortifications, but with the heroic fighting of the Eighth Route Army and the enthusiastic assistance of the people, the puppet army was completely resolved in less than two days.

This newspaper, Yangcheng, 15th. The two regiments of the Chiang army's 31st Division, 91st Regiment and 92nd Regiment, which invaded our Wenxi Liberated Area, have been completely destroyed. In addition to casualties, more than 1,000 people, including the regimental commander, laid down their weapons. Since the Kuomintang army occupied Wenxi City on the 11th, the two regiments of the 31st Division of the Kuomintang army occupying Yanzhang Town southeast of Wenxi launched a "mopping up" operation against our outer defense forces. Our army defended itself in sorrow and anger, and on the evening of the 13th, in the northwest area of Yanzhang Town, the two regiments of the division were completely annihilated, and 4 mountain guns, 7 mortars, 8 heavy machine guns, more than 30 light machine guns, more than 500 rifles, more than 100 mules and horses, and a part of ammunition were seized. Yanzhang Town was immediately recovered by us.

This newspaper, Yangcheng, 13th. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the Chiang-Yan allied forces re-occupied Wenxi City on the 11th, and are now fiercely attacking our army's positions north of Wenxi.

Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 13th. The Kuomintang army in the middle and at both ends of the Jiaoji Railway continues to attack the Liberated Area fiercely, and has invaded Zichuan and Jiyang cities. The Kuomintang Eighth Army, which fled west from Changle, invaded Zhangdian on the 5th, and then attacked Zichuan City along the Zibo Railway, invading the city on the morning of the 9th. The next day, in coordination with a part of the Kuomintang 73rd Army that attacked south from Zhoucun, and with the assistance of aircraft, they attacked Boshan in three routes. The local Eighth Route Army fought heroically and launched a fierce bayonet battle, driving them back and shooting down a Kuomintang plane. Another part of the Kuomintang army that attacked northeast from Jinan invaded Jiyang City, which was liberated by the Eighth Route Army in August last year, on the 5th, and carried out wanton burning, killing and looting. The citizens in the city have fled one after another. In the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, the Kuomintang 54th Army, after invading Jimo, has been attacking Nanquan Station on the Jiaoji Railway, more than 40 li west of the city, since the 4th, firing nearly a thousand shells every day. The Eighth Route Army and the local militia calmly responded to the battle, causing more than 200 casualties to the invading army in two days. Suffering such a powerful blow, the morale of the regiment was depressed, and it had retreated to the Zhujiabozi and Yuanzhuang (more than 20 li southwest of Jimo City) line on the 6th, seemingly regrouping for another attack.
