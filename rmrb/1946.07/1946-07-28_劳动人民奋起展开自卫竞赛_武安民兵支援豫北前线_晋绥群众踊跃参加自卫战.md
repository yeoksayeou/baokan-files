    The laboring people have risen up and launched a self-defense competition.
    Wu'an Militia Support the Yu-North Front
    Jin-Sui Masses Actively Participate in the Self-Defense War
    [This newspaper, Wu'an] More than 400 militiamen from the new and old liberated areas of Wu'an supporting the Jin-North front set off for the front line on the 20th. When the militiamen in the old areas of Yangyi, Guantaochuan, and Berlin were rushing to weed the seedlings, they heard the news that the Kuomintang in northern Henan was actively preparing to attack and constantly harassing the border people, and they expressed great indignation and concern. They immediately mobilized urgently that night, handed over production work to the rear masses and women, organized expedition teams, and excitedly embarked on the journey, carrying "steel guns" seized from the Japanese invaders and full of hand grenades. The landmines that had been abandoned in Berlin for a long time were re-equipped with detonators, and the militiamen took these "guard dogs" to northern Henan to guard the gate of the border area. The militiamen from Chengguan Street, who supported the front line for the first time, were all laboring people who had just been liberated. In order to defend their liberated areas, they launched a self-defense competition with the militiamen in the old areas. When they left, they carried shoes, socks, and dry food specially prepared by their families. When the militiamen walked through the center of the street in the morning sun, the masses leaning against the door to see them off frequently blessed them to return victoriously as soon as possible. The farmers who were fertilizing the fields outside Nanguan affectionately urged the militiamen: "Do a good job, young men! Drive away the wolves from our homes, and come back to eat new grain. We have suffered enough from Yang Sizi's hardships, and we can't let anyone oppress us again."

    [Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 15th] The Yan puppet army's offensive against the Jin-Sui Liberated Area has aroused the anger of the people throughout the border area, who have demanded to participate in the self-defense war and arm themselves to defend their homes. After learning the news that the Yan puppet army was attacking the border area, the masses in the second district of Fangshan were filled with indignation. One hundred and seventeen militiamen requested to participate in the war, and twenty young people volunteered to go to the front line as nurses. After the nephew of the village chief of Gaojia Village, Xingxian, signed up to participate in the war, nine militiamen from various natural villages immediately responded. Li Haiwang, the militia captain of Dongtuyu, Lanxian, led 92 militiamen from the entire village to sign up. Forty-seven militiamen and 532 self-defense members from Yangjiapo administrative village, Shenjiang, requested to go to the front line to participate in the war. When the militia set off, the masses from various places warmly comforted and saw them off, and guaranteed the production of the militia's families. In Congluoyu, Linxian, nineteen people signed up to provide fixed substitute cultivation for the participating militia. Nanguan Niu Shuangda of Lanxian said: "I volunteer to cultivate all of Liu Fuquan's land and ensure that his crops are hoeed and harvested well."
