    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Shanghai News: On the evening of June 20th, three US Navy soldiers at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road, with a "Jeep girl" in tow, were joking and laughing along the way, recklessly barging around. An old man was even beaten and knocked to the ground. A passing soldier, filled with righteous indignation, was about to step forward to question them, when the three US soldiers punched him violently in the face. This aroused public outrage, and people stepped forward to question them. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the US soldiers fled into the US Navy Club on Jing'an Temple Road. The crowd swarmed after them, reaching several thousand people, and the situation immediately became tense. Both Chinese and American military police, armed with guns, rushed to suppress the crowd. The crowd unanimously demanded that the violent US soldiers be punished, but the US military police, without asking any questions, used force to disperse the crowd.
