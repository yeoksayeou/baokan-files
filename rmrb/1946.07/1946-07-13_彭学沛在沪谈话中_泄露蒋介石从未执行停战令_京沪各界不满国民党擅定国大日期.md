　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th. Xinhua News Agency reporter writes: Chiang Kai-shek's spokesman, Peng Xuepei's, talk at the foreign press conference in Shanghai on the 8th, may be the most candid of all the Kuomintang officials' stereotyped propaganda to date. Peng's argument has two points: First, "Today's cessation of conflict depends on the solution of the reorganization of the army and the designation of garrison locations." This means that the civil war cannot be stopped today, because Chiang Kai-shek has decided to seize more places from the Liberated Areas, such as Northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Rehe, Chahar, Andong, etc. Second, the Political Consultative Conference agreements "have not been implemented," "primarily because the issue of cessation of conflict has not been resolved." In short, as far as Chiang Kai-shek is concerned, the conflict cannot be stopped for a single day until the goal of eliminating the Liberated Areas is achieved; therefore, the PCC resolutions cannot be implemented for a single day either. The January 10th ceasefire order was originally unconditional, but now it has become conditional. The condition is to allow Chiang Kai-shek to continue his offensive. The PCC resolutions were originally responsible to the whole country and to the people of the whole country, but now they have become Chiang Kai-shek's exchange securities for fighting the Communist Party. As long as the Communist Party does not allow Chiang Kai-shek to promote dictatorship in the Liberated Areas, then Chiang Kai-shek will act shamelessly, and he will not implement democracy in the whole country. For example, he will not implement the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, he will not allow people freedom of speech and assembly, he will beat people, kill people, deceive people, sell the country, etc. This was originally Chiang Kai-shek's secret, which he never made public. He always said verbally that he had implemented the ceasefire order and the PCC resolutions. Even Peng Xuepei himself said in Nanjing at 3:00 PM on June 30th: "The government has always adhered to the principle of political settlement in dealing with the Communist Party issue. 'Central' troops will not take military action against the Communist army, and will wait for the resolution of various unresolved issues." But at 4:00 PM on July 8th, in Shanghai, he automatically confessed because he was overly flustered by the CCP's insistence on peaceful negotiations. He formally announced that Chiang Kai-shek had not implemented the ceasefire order and the PCC resolutions in the past, and would refuse to implement them in the future. This is the value of his talk.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th. The Kuomintang authorities' unauthorized announcement of the National Assembly to be held on November 12th, not only the CCP, the Democratic League, and people of insight from all walks of life expressed their protest and regret, but also all circles in Beijing and Shanghai believe that this move is tantamount to a "political atomic bomb" for the Chinese situation. It adds new difficulties to the peace talks. The Kuomintang newspapers are very tough on this, believing that they are "taking the initiative," and also said: "Whether the CCP attends or not is not worth considering." However, Chinese and foreign public opinion circles and people from all walks of life have expressed great concern, because the Kuomintang's move clearly shows its determination to undermine the peace and unity of the whole country.

　　彭学沛在沪谈话中
　  泄露蒋介石从未执行停战令
    京沪各界不满国民党擅定国大日期
    【新华社延安十日电】新华社记者称：蒋介石发言人彭学沛八日在上海外国记者招待会的谈话，可能是迄今为止国民党官僚的八股宣传中最坦白者。彭的论点有二：一、“今日之停止冲突，系于整编军队与指定驻地问题之解决”。这就是说，内战今天决定不能停止，因为蒋介石决定从解放区夺取更多的地方，例如苏北、山东、热河、察哈尔、安东等等。二、政治协商会议协议“未见实行”，“首先又是由于停止冲突问题之未见解决”。总而言之，在蒋介石，消灭解放区目的未达之前，冲突即一日不能停止；因此，政协决议亦一日不能实行。一月十日停战令，原来是无条件的，现在变为有条件了，条件就是允许蒋介石继续进攻。政协决议原来是对全国、对全国人民负责的，现在变为蒋介石手中对共产党作斗争的交易所证券了。只要共产党不让蒋介石到解放区推广独裁，那么，蒋介石就要放赖，不在全国实行民主。例如说，就不实行和平建国纲领，就不许人民言论集会自由，就要打人、杀人、骗人，就要卖国等等。这本是蒋介石从不公开的内心的秘密，他从来在口头上都说是已经实行停战令，已经实行政协决议的，连彭学沛自己在六月三十日下午三时在南京都还说：“政府对共产党问题，一本政治解决之方针始终遵守“中央军队不对共军采取军事之行动，以静候各项未决问题之解决”，但到七月八日下午四时，在上海他却因中共力主和平谈判过分慌乱而自动坦白了，他正式宣布蒋介石过去并未实行过停战令和政协决议，将来亦拒绝实行之，这就是他的谈话的价值所在。
    【新华社南京十日电】国民党当局擅自宣布十一月十二日召开国大事，不仅中共、民盟及社会贤达各方表示抗议与遗憾，即京沪各界，亦均认为此举不啻为中国时局之“政治原子弹”，它使和平谈判横增新困难。而国民党报纸对此甚为强硬，认为“争取主动”，又称：“中共出席与否，不值一顾”。但中外舆论界及社会各界人士莫不表示极大之忧虑，因国民党此举显然决心破坏全国的和平团结。
