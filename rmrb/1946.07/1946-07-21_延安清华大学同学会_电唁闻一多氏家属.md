	Mrs. Wen Yiduo and all family members, greetings:

	We are shocked and grieved to learn that Mr. Wen Yiduo and your son were assassinated by the Kuomintang fascists in Kunming! Mr. Wen has consistently embodied the spirit of our school's fine traditions of advocating democracy and science in China's new cultural undertakings. In recent years, he has worked tirelessly for the cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy, and is a model for our younger alumni. Now, the Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to realize their treacherous, civil war, dictatorial conspiracy, have resorted to such despicable and vicious acts against Mr. Wen. We vow to inherit Mr. Wen's legacy and fight against the dictators and traitors. We hereby send our condolences.
