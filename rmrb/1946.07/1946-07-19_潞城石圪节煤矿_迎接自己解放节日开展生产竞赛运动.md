Lucheng Shigiejie Coal Mine
    Launches Production Competition to Welcome its Own Liberation Day
    [This dispatch from Changzhi] The Lucheng Shigiejie Coal Mine was seized back from the enemy by the mine's workers on August 18th of last year, when they responded to our army's counter-offensive and coordinated from within in an armed uprising. The mine currently has over 600 workers, making it the largest mine in the Shangdang District. After liberation, the workers gained freedom, and their enthusiasm for production greatly increased, quickly catching up with pre-liberation production levels. Later, due to improper administrative management, such as wages being lower than other coal mines, failure to implement the principle of benefiting both the public and private interests by both increasing production and improving workers' lives, and one-sided emphasis on public and revolutionary interests, demanding reduced costs, and the trade union's neglect of worker education and raising their awareness, leading to disunity and reduced production. After mutual review and ideological alignment, joint management was implemented, administrative cadres also did trade union work, wages were increased, and workers' lives were improved, leading to a renewed increase in production. At the workers' congress on "July 1st," all workers, under the call of the trade union and Comrade Wang Gengxi, the former underground army leader, launched a production competition to welcome their own "August 18th" Liberation Day. The competition conditions are: (1) Underground workers should increase output, reaching 0.8 metric tons (1600 Jin) per person per shift. (2) Surface workers should ensure tools are not damaged. (3) Drainage workers should ensure at least 0.5 inches of water is reduced every day (24 hours). (4) Coke workers should ensure more large pieces and fewer small pieces are produced, increasing output by one time, and a judging committee will be selected to summarize and elect model workers on "August 18th."

　　潞城石圪节煤矿
    迎接自己解放节日开展生产竞赛运动
    【本报长治讯】潞城石圪节煤矿，是去年八月十八日该矿工人响应我军反攻，武装起义里应外合，由敌人手中夺回来的。该矿现有六百多工人，是上党区最大的一个矿山。解放后工人得到自由，生产情绪大大提高，很快就赶上解放前的生产量。后因行政管理不当，如：工资较低于其他煤窑，未能贯彻执行既增加生产又改善工人生活的公私两利方针，片面强调公家利益、革命利益，要求减低成本等，而工会亦忽视工人教育，提高其觉悟，以致互不团结，生产降低。后经双方检讨，打通思想，实行共同管理，行政干部也做工会工作，工资增加，工人生活得到改善，生产重又提高。在“七一”开职工大会时，全体工人在工会与原地下军领袖王更喜同志号召下，为迎接自己的解放节日“八一八”展开生产竞赛运动。竞赛条件为：（一）坑下工友提高产量，每人每班要达到○·八公吨（合一千六百市斤）。（二）坑上工友保证工具不坏。（三）排水工友保证每天（二十四小时）至少减水○·五寸。（四）焦炭工友保证多出大块少出碎末增加产量一倍，并选出评判委员，到“八一八”总结选举模范。
