Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: A telegram from Beiping reports that Zhang Dongsun, Chen Jinkun, and 148 others here jointly issued a circular telegram on the 7th of this month opposing the civil war, demanding that the United States not foster chaos in China, and calling on the people of the whole country to launch an anti-civil war movement. The original telegram is as follows:

　　The negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are dragging on like this, and the common people really can't stand it anymore. Everyone knows that after eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, China absolutely cannot withstand another civil war. The two parties involved have repeatedly stated that they are mindful of the people and the country, and that in view of the current economic crisis, they are unwilling to start a war and are still continuing peaceful negotiations. Now, while negotiating, they are also deploying troops, and the common people are suffering the most. From the standpoint of the common people, we make another tearful appeal: First, the negotiations must succeed and cannot fail, but they must never be allowed to drag on. Second, we advocate that all aid from friendly nations be limited to the construction of China's revival, and that anything that could plunge China into chaos must be avoided. Third, we advocate that military and political affairs are inseparable, that military problems must be solved by political means, and that democratic politics must be rapidly realized, and a coalition government of all parties and factions and non-party figures must be established from the central to the local level.

　　In addition to the three points appealed to above, we further hope that the people of the whole country will have a broad anti-war movement to promote the comprehensive and permanent peace of China with the power of the people.

　　The signatories include: Zhang Dongsun, Zhou Jingwen, Chen Jinkun, Liu Qingyang, Fu Tingyi, Jiang Shaoyuan, Guang Weiran, Meng Gongchen, Zhou Lengjia, Zhou Yinren, Xu Shouxuan, Xu Zhonghang, Ma Yanxiang, Chen Beiou, Huang, etc., a total of 148 people.

　　张东荪等百四十余人
    通电号召反对内战
    要求美国勿助长中国纷乱
    【新华社延安十九日电】北平讯：此间张东荪陈瑾昆等一百四十八人，本月七日联名通电反对内战，要求美国不要助长中国纷乱，号召全国人民发动反内战运动。原电如下：
    国共商谈这样拖延，老百姓实在受不了。大家都知道，中国在八年艰苦抗战之后，无论如何决不堪再打内战。当事的两党屡次声明，都以人民国家为念，目睹当前的经济危机，不愿先启战端，仍在继续和平商谈。现在这样一面商谈，一面却又调兵遣将，最苦的是老百姓。在老百姓的立场，我们再作痛哭流涕的呼吁：第一，商谈只许成功，不许失败，但是也决不能拖下去。第二，我们主张友邦的一切援助限于中国复兴的建设事业中，足以陷中国于纷乱的，务必避免。第三，我们主张军事与政治不可分，军事问题必须以政治方式解决，且须迅速实现民主政治，成立由中央至地方的各党各派与无党无派的联合政府。
    除以上所呼吁的三点外，我们更希望全国人民应有广大的反战运动，以人民的力量促进中国的全面的永久的和平。
    签名者计有：张东荪、周鲸文、陈瑾昆、刘清扬、符亭懿、江绍原、光未然、孟拱辰、周楞迦、周荫人，徐寿轩，徐仲航、马彦祥、陈北鸥、荒等共一百四十八人。
