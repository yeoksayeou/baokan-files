Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: Chongqing News: At a symposium held by the Chongqing Small and Medium-Sized Factories Union on the 27th of last month, unanimous opposition was voiced against the Kuomintang authorities' economic policy of welcoming the intrusion of American goods and destroying national industry. The meeting decided to demand that the authorities establish an industrial policy that conforms to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles of nationalism and people's livelihood. Chambers of commerce across various regions requested that the authorities immediately reclaim inland river navigation rights to save the crisis in industry and commerce and prevent China from becoming a colony of the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: Shanghai News: Shanghai's domestic paper mills are on the verge of collapse due to the dumping of American goods. Taking white newsprint rolls as an example, American goods, including freight and tariffs, cost less than 10,000 yuan per ream, while domestic paper costs as much as 25,000 yuan per ream to produce. Since March, Tianfeng, Dalu, Zhonghua, Zhongguo, Huazhang, and the Seventh Paper Mill, taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs from the enemy and puppet regimes, have already closed down. In addition, Hailong, Jinfeng, Guangzhong, Hualun, Yong'an, Shenzhou, Qinxin, Xingye, and other factories are operating intermittently or only during the day. They all feel a deep sense of crisis and cannot sustain themselves for long.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 13th: Chongqing News: Sichuan Province's national industry is facing a crisis of collapse. During the war, Sichuan's annual salt production was eight million dan, but after the war, it decreased to five million dan due to the government's decreasing purchase volume. The Zigong Salt Field originally planned to produce 400,000 dan in June, but production was reduced by one-third. Recently, many salt producers have stopped boiling salt because the government stopped paying for salt. All 494 charcoal kilns belonging to the Charcoal Flower Guild in the Fifth District of Zigong were forced to stop boiling on June 2nd, and Jiuda Company's salt production also suffered the same fate on the same day. In Chengdu, more than 80 raw material factories in the paper, chemical, dyeing and weaving, and machinery industries are also in a state of shutdown. As for the cigarette industry, it had 327 factories during the war, with more than 100,000 people directly and indirectly dependent on it for their livelihoods. However, after the victory, due to the influx of American goods, according to statistics in April, 230 large and small cigarette factories had closed down, leaving only more than 30,000 workers barely maintaining a starvation existence. The alcohol factories in Neijiang have also closed down one after another due to the flooding of American goods and the sluggish sales of their products. Only three or four factories are now barely surviving.

TASS, New York, July 13th: According to a report by a New York Tribune reporter, American goods have gradually replaced Chinese goods. Because American goods are much cheaper than Chinese goods, Chinese goods cannot compete with American goods. The reporter pointed out that American cotton is 20% cheaper than Chinese cotton; American California milk powder has forced Chinese milk companies to close down. Large companies and vendors in Shanghai are full of American goods, and American textiles, cigarettes, etc., are continuously shipped into China. Currently, China's imports are twenty times more than its exports. According to the reporter, as a result of the flooding of American goods, large-scale unemployment has occurred in major coastal cities in China. It is impossible for major local factories to resume post-war production. The reporter strongly stated that the Chinese government could take effective measures to quickly stop the dumping of foreign goods, but the Chinese government is unwilling to do so.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 15th: Guangzhou News: Under the massive intrusion of smuggled American cigarettes, only a dozen of the original 99 cigarette factories in Guangzhou are struggling to survive. The large-scale Dongya Cigarette Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has also ceased operations. Only 19 of the original 200 cigarette factories in Shaoguan remain, and they are all in a precarious state. Currently, manufacturers are appealing to the authorities to stop the smuggling of American goods to save domestic cigarettes.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 14th: Shanghai News: Under the pressure of American goods dumping, capitalists from Britain, France, and other countries in this area jointly petitioned the Kuomintang authorities in Shanghai on the 18th of last month, requesting improvements in economic policies. The petitioners included British representative Gaskell, Dutch representative Dori, Swiss representative Bratov, Norwegian representative Hogerk, and French representative Schetau.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 13th: Shanghai News: Labor strikes are continuing to occur in Shanghai. According to incomplete statistics, 34 strikes occurred in June, involving more than 7,000 people. These strikes encompassed shipbuilding, flour, textiles, machinery, papermaking, trams, film, light bulbs, barber shops, hotels, Western restaurants, Western clothing, soda, soap, tobacco, drama, and candy industries. Among these, the strikes in the Western clothing, barber shop, and soda industries have not yet been resolved. The main cause of the labor strikes is the massive intrusion of American goods, which has led to the closure of national industries. This has resulted in unemployment for workers, making it impossible for them to make a living, and they have been forced to resist. However, the Kuomintang authorities have responded with bloody suppression. Many labor leaders, such as Li Bingsen, chairman of the ribbon industry union; Cen Jiangfeng, secretary of the machinery industry union; Fang Qingping, representative of the refrigeration industry workers; Zhao Guiliang, representative of the barber industry workers; and Zhu Weichang, representative of the workers in eastern Shanghai, were stabbed by dispatched secret agents. This has aroused extreme indignation among workers in various industries and people from all walks of life. They held a demonstration a few days ago to protest the Kuomintang authorities' brutal behavior. The mothers and wives of the victimized workers rode in rickshaws and participated in the march. Since the day before yesterday, telegraph bureau workers have also gone on a full strike, affecting all Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies.

　　国民党当局欢迎美货倾销
    民族工业风雨飘摇
    沪工潮继续发生国民党当局施以血腥镇压
    【新华社延安十四日电】渝讯：重庆中小工厂联合会于上月二十七日座谈中，对国民党当局欢迎美货侵入，摧毁民族工业的经济政策，一致表示反对。会中决定向当局要求，确立一个合乎孙中山先生的民族主义及民生主义的工业政策。各地百货同业则要求当局立即收回内河航行权，以挽救工商业危机，使中国勿沦为美国的殖民地。
    【新华社延安十五日电】沪讯：沪国产造纸厂因美货倾销，已濒绝境。以卷筒白报纸而论，美货连运费关税在内，每令不到一万元，而国产纸每令成本即高达二万五千元。自三月份迄今，倒闭之国产纸厂已有天丰、大陆、中华、中国、华章，及经济部接管敌伪之纸厂第七厂等多家。另有海龙、晋丰、光中、华伦、永安、神州、勤工、兴业等厂是时停时开，或只开日班。亦均感危机深重，不克久持。
    【新华社延安十三日电】渝讯：川省民族工业正面临崩溃危机战时全川年产盐八百万担，战后因政府购量日益减少降为五百万担。自流井盐场六月份原预产四十万担，后产量减少三分之一。最近又因官方停支盐价，更使许多灶户停煎。自流井第五区内炭花公会所属炭灶四百九十四家，已被迫于六月二日全部停煎，久大公司制盐亦于同日遭受同样厄运。在成都仅造纸、化学、染织、机械四业原材料厂八十余家，（中缺数字）亦陷歇业状态。再如纸烟业，战时曾达三百二十七家，直接间接依之为生者，在十万人以上，但胜利后，由于美货充斥，据四月份统计，大小烟厂倒闭者已有二百三十家，仅余三万多工人勉强维持饥饿生活。内江之酒精工厂，亦因美货泛滥，产品滞销，相继关门。现只余三四家工厂，勉强维持。
    【新华社延安十五日电】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：据纽约论坛报记者报导，美国商品已逐渐代替了中国货物。由于美国商品价格比中国商品要低得多，因此中国商品不能与美国商品竞争。该记者指出，美棉要比中国棉花便宜百分之二十；美国加利福尼亚州的奶粉，已迫使中国牛奶公司关闭。上海各大公司与摊贩到处充斥美国货，美国的纺织品、香烟等，已源源运入中国，目前中国的进口货已较出口货多二十倍。据该记者称：由于美国商品泛滥的结果，中国沿海各大城市已发生大批失业现象。当地各大工厂中没有可能恢复进行战后生产。该记者力称：中国政府采取有效办法，可能迅速阻止外货的倾销，可是中国政府不愿意这样做。
    【新华社延安十五日电】广州讯：在走私美烟大量侵入下，广州原有之九十九家烟厂现仅余十余家苟延残喘。规模宏大之经济部东亚烟厂，亦告停工。韶关原有二百余家烟厂，现亦仅余十九家，且均在风雨飘摇中。现各厂商纷向当局呼吁，杜绝走私美货，以挽救土烟。
    【新华社延安十四日电】沪讯：在美货倾销压迫下，此间英、法等国资本家于上月十八日联名向沪市国民党当局请愿，要求改善经济政策。在请愿书中签名的有英商代表葛士威克、荷商代表多利、瑞士商代表勃拉脱、挪商代表何果克、法商代表薛翘脱等。
    【新华社延安十三日电】沪讯：上海工潮仍继续发生，据不完全统计，六月份共发生三十四起，参加人数在七千人以上，包括造船、面粉、纺织、机器、造纸、电车、电影、电灯泡、理发、旅馆、西餐、西服、汽水、肥皂、烟草、戏剧、糖果、新闻各业，其中西服、理发、汽水等等工潮，迄今尚未解决。工潮主要起因，为美货大量侵入，民族工业，纷纷倒闭，以致工人失业，无法生活，不得已起而抗争，而国民党当局对此竟施以血腥镇压。有许多工人领袖，如织带业工会理事长李秉森，机器业工会秘书岑江风，冷藏业工人代表方青萍、理发业工人代表赵贵良及沪东工人代表诸维昌等，竟被派遣特务刺伤，引起各业工人及社会人士极度愤慨，曾于日前举行游行示威，抗议国民党当局此种残暴行为，被害工人的母亲、妻子，均乘人力车随队出发游行。前日起，电报局报工亦全体罢工，各中外报纸通讯社，均蒙受影响。
