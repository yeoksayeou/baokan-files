You Will Always Belong to the People!
	—— Mourning Mr. Li Gongpu

	When I saw the news of your assassination reported in the newspaper with prominent headlines, placed in the top position, I felt a moment of chest-bursting suffocation, my hands trembled, and my tears burst forth.

	Let me recall some fragments of my memory about my comrade Gongpu.

	In April 1937, when the "Seven Gentlemen Incident" patriotic case was brought to public prosecution in the Suzhou Higher Court by the Kuomintang reactionary authorities, and the public trial began in May, Mr. Gongpu and six other gentlemen, including Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, Zhang Naiqi, Sha Qianli, and Wang Zaoshi, were imprisoned together, while Ms. Shi Liang and I were confined in adjacent cells. Initially, we had no contact, but after the public prosecution, we tried to read each other's pleadings (theirs and mine), exchanging various opinions. In a word, we were planning how to cooperate in fighting the common enemy. When the public trial began, in the waiting room and in the courtroom, we exchanged knowing warm handshakes, indignation, and silent encouragement. At that time, Gongpu was so vigorous, firm, and tenacious! He was not much older than me, but he had a thick, lustrous beard. He always liked to habitually stroke his long beard whenever he gave an eloquent speech. Yes, this gave me a special impression of seasoned and arrogant demeanor, which was necessary and essential when dealing with the shameless reactionaries.

	The "July 7th" Incident occurred. Under the pressure of the will and action of the people across the country, at 5 p.m. on July 31st, we were released from prison at the same time, and we embraced each other with fervent handshakes at the Suzhou Garden Hotel. In early August, we maintained close contact again at the Central Hotel in Nanjing. After the "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out, Gongpu went to North China to work at Shanxi People's University. Soon after, he braved the hardships and returned to Shanghai once, planning to invite a group of friends to go north together for cooperation, and I was one of those he had in mind. I remember one day, we took a car together to give a lecture at Huahua Middle School. After his lecture, we went to a café together and had a long talk. From him, I learned about the sinful acts of the Kuomintang army led by Liu Zhi and Yan Xishan on the Pinghan and Tongpu fronts, who collapsed at the first touch, abandoning the vast territory and people of the motherland, causing great disasters and chaos. I learned about the brave actions of the Eighth Route Army, crossing the river eastward, advancing into the Shanxi and North China battlefields, and the revolutionary prairie fire of self-salvation that was ignited among the broad masses of the people.

	In the summer of 1938, Gongpu returned from North China to Wuhan. Unfortunately, he was detained for the second time by the Kuomintang reactionaries under Chen Cheng for so-called "certain suspicions." After the efforts of Mr. Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, Huang Qixiang, Shen Junru, and various other parties, and with the support of all sides, he was released after being detained for many days. When we met at Mr. Shen Junru's place, he was not disheartened but actively preparing to return to North China. From him, I saw the invincible strength and heart of a people's fighter.

	At that time, I also intended to devote myself to North China. We didn't have time to talk much, nor did we have time to see him off. We just shook hands tightly and said, "Okay, we'll meet on the northern battlefield of the motherland."

	After leaving Wuhan, he first went to Yan'an, and then transferred to Jin-Cha-Ji. In the autumn of 1940, I had just come to Taihang from the Jinan Liberated Area. We actually met in Dongliaocheng Village, located in the depths of Taihang, on the bank of the Qingzhang River, surrounded by mountains and rivers, with lush bamboo and trees, reminiscent of the Jiangnan landscape, which was the seat of the highest temporary new political power of the people behind enemy lines – the Jinan-Taihang-Taiyue Administrative Joint Office. At that time, our reunion on the battlefield after two years of separation, was after the fall of Wuhan, when the enemy bandits shifted their troops to sweep through North China, and would further blockade and divide the entire liberated area battlefield in North China; it was also at the time when the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war began to be deliberately divided, Wang Jingwei openly surrendered to the enemy bandits, and Chiang Kai-shek pretended to resist Japan, going their separate ways to engage in anti-communism and anti-people activities, sabotaging the unity and progress of the War of Resistance, and attempting to turn China into a colony forever and enslave the Chinese people, in exchange for the traitorous benefits of a few big landlords and big comprador class. The exposure of Yan Xishan's plot to create the December Incident, and Shi Yousan, Zhu Huaibing, and others' collusion with the enemy and puppets to expand friction were unforgettable blood cases that occurred before this period. At this time, our meeting was filled with indescribable emotion and indignation!

	We lived together for about two weeks. During this meeting, I discovered a more significant difference in Gongpu's demeanor compared to the past. If, during the three meetings in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Wuhan, he was still purely enthusiastic as a progressive patriotic intellectual, after two years of practical experience in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Cha-Ji, and Taihang Liberated Areas, everything about him had become truly more "simple" and "sincere." He saw the great creativity and vitality of the Chinese people; he saw the several new pages of the great history written by the Chinese people with their own blood; he saw the new China of the people, which had already appeared and grown on their own land, radiating brilliant light. I felt that he had absorbed infinitely rich and solid knowledge, courage, and new strength from it.

	He loved the liberated areas and the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, the people's wise and resolute helmsman, guards, and revolutionary group. He didn't want to leave again, but precisely because of his love, he said: "If the progressive, vivid struggles and construction of the enemy's rear are conveyed to the rear, it would be a great encouragement to the people there, and a clear contrast to the reactionary dark situation. This work is our unshirkable responsibility." Therefore, although Deputy Commander Peng, Commander Liu Deng, Chairman Yang, and others were concerned about him as a progressive comrade and feared that he would suffer the poisonous hands of the Wuhan Incident again after returning to the rear, they repeatedly urged him to stay in the border area to participate in work and contribute to the cultural and educational cause behind enemy lines as much as he could. I also repeatedly expressed this sincere wish, but Gongpu, in the end, returned south again in order to fulfill his mission of "spreading the gospel" to the liberated areas. At that time, I wrote a poem to commemorate this farewell:

	In the depths of Taihang, on the bank of the Zhang River,
	Gongpu whips his horse and sets out,
	A sincere heart remains behind enemy lines,
	The moon over Mount Emei shines brightly in the distance.

	Unexpectedly, this parting has now become a final farewell!

	Mr. Gongpu is dead, and you died so heroically, so gloriously! Your blood, together with the blood shed by the Chinese people and their millions of outstanding sons and daughters, has condensed into an incomparably huge fireball, illuminating the future of the motherland and the complete liberation of the people.

	Since you left Taihang five or six years ago, you have tirelessly strived for the cause of the War of Resistance, the people, and democratic unity in the fascist-controlled areas. In this process, I know that you and your family have experienced great hardships and setbacks in life and career; I know that the fascist bandits have also tried every means to lure you, anesthetize you, and confuse you; at the same time, they have used the same despicable means to threaten you, intimidate you, and attack you. However, from the JiaoChangKou Incident, you openly gave the fascist robbers a ruthless answer, giving the Chinese people and all your comrades-in-arms unparalleled comfort, saying: "Sacrificing for the democratic movement, death is without regret!" And said: "We must work for the cause of peace, democracy, and the people to the end, until death." Mr. Gongpu, this is the uplifting of the righteous spirit of your "Seven Gentlemen Incident" and the Wuhan Incident, this is the sincere expression of the new knowledge, courage, and strength that the people gave you during the two years of your life behind enemy lines. And today, the death that the fascists gave you can be regarded as a final conclusion.

	Of the "Seven Gentlemen" in the patriotic case, the first to die from suffering fascist torture and accumulated overwork was Mr. Taofen, and the second was you, who died from the same torment, and finally died under the bloody hands of the fascists.

	Taofen's death was from illness in the warm embrace of the liberated area of the people he loved and who loved him. He was still able to calmly request that his ashes be moved to Yan'an; he was still able to ask the Chinese people's party—the Communist Party—to approve his posthumous recognition as a party member. He was much luckier than you, but Gongpu, you were caught off guard and suffered the enemy's poisonous hands, unable to arrange your affairs according to your will.

	However, when I think about it again, your death was actually very appropriate and very timely. Mr. Taofen, from his dying mouth, which had been calling for the people all his life, spat out a crimson heart that was consistent with his life—"Serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly," unconditionally giving everything to the Chinese people and their leading group. And you, at a time when the Chinese and American reactionaries are jointly intensifying their persecution of the Chinese nation and people, through the muzzles of the unprecedentedly rampant fascist bandits, spat out your crimson heart of "serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly," which proves with steel that for the cause of the motherland's independence, peace, and democracy, for the people's freedom, liberation, and emancipation, you were not selfish, not discouraged, you did not compromise with the enemy, did not surrender, you never forgot or failed the Chinese people, you always stood firmly on the side of the Chinese people, especially since you died among the millions of broad masses of people who are directly suffering the brutal trampling of the Chinese fascists and American reactionaries, you and the people achieved "living and dying together, sharing weal and woe." Gongpu, you are worthy of being the people's "Gongpu," and the Chinese people and all democrats will never forget you or fail you!

	You fell in your own sacred and boiling blood. The righteous blood you shed will increase the new vitality of the Chinese people and the democratic movement. Your blood and your forever fiery heart will make all the democratic fighters and patriots in the Chinese fascist-ruled areas more clearly recognize the common enemy, and will move forward in the direction of your and the Chinese people's struggle with steps that are as uniform and firm as yours, or even more so!

	I mourn Gongpu, but in my bright tears, I clearly see Gongpu's immortal glorious smile -

	"I will always belong to the Chinese people!"

### 你是永远属于人民的！——哭公朴先生

　　你是永远属于人民的！
    ——哭公朴先生
    当我看到报纸以第一条的地位，特号的大字，把你被暗杀的消息，传到我的眼里时，刹那间，我感到胸际炸裂般的室息，我的手在颤抖，我的泪夺眶奔落。
    让我回想一下，在我的记忆中，关于公朴这个战友的几段影迹吧。
    一九三七年的四月，当爱国案的“七人之狱”，在苏州高等法院，被国民党反动当局，提付公诉，五月，开始公审的时候，公朴先生和沈钧儒、邹韬奋、章乃器、沙千里、王造时等六位先生，关在一处，史良先生和我，毗邻的关在另一处。起初，我们并没有任何联系，而自公诉以后，我们便设法相互的看阅对方的辩诉状（他们七人和我个人的），交换着各种意见，一句话，我们在策划着对共同敌人，如何配合作战。公审开始了，我们在候审室，在法庭上，曾交换着会心的热握、忾愤和无言的鼓励。那时的公朴是那样的矫健、坚定、顽强！他年纪并不比我大，但他却留着一撮丰泽的美髯，他在每次作那雄辩的发言时，总喜欢习惯的捋着他的长须，是的，这给了我一种特殊老练而傲岸的印象，而这确是对待无耻的反动派所必然和必须的。
    “七七”事变发生了，在全国人民的意志和行动的压力下，七月三十一号下午五时，我们同时被释出狱，在苏州的花园饭店，狂热的握手拥抱着。八月初，我们又在南京中央饭店，保持着密切的接触。“八一三”上海战争发生后，公朴远去华北，在山西民大任职，不久，他不辞艰辛，跑回上海一次，打算邀一批朋友北去，共同合作，我呢，也是他所属意的人之一。记得有一天，我们同坐汽车去华华中学讲演，在他讲演后，同到一家咖啡馆，作了一番长谈，从他口中，得知国民党军刘峙部阎锡山部，在平汉、同蒲前线，一触即溃，丢弃祖国的广大国土和人民，造成莫大的灾难和混乱的罪恶行为；得知八路军，渡河东下，挺进山西和华北战场的勇壮行动和在广大人民中掀起的，自救的革命的燎原烈焰。
    三八年夏，公朴由华北返至武汉，不幸，又因所谓“某种嫌疑”，第二次被国民党反动派陈诚扣押了，经过周恩来、郭沫若、黄琪翔、沈钧儒诸先生的多方奔走和各方面的声援，他在关了不少日子以后才被释放。当我们在沈钧儒先生处见面时，他正毫不灰心丧气的，积极准备着重回华北，从他的身上，我看到一个人民战士的不可征服的力和心。
    那时，我也正有投身华北的打算，我们没时间多谈，也来不及送他，就紧紧的握了一握手说：“好，我们在祖国的北方战场见面”。
    他离汉以后，先到了延安，然后转到了晋察冀。在一九四○年的秋天，我刚从冀南解放区来到太行，我们在敌后人民临时的最高新政权——冀南太行太岳行政联合办事处的所在地，在太行深处，清漳河畔，山环水绕，竹树蓊翠，饶有江南风趣的东辽城村竟然见到面了。当时我们一别两年的战地重逢，正在武汉失守，敌寇移兵扫荡华北以后，并将进一步对华北整个解放区战场，进行残毒的封锁分割以前；正在国民党反动派内战起了有计划的分化，汪精卫公开投降敌寇而蒋介石伪装抗战，彼此分道扬辘的进行反共反人民，破坏抗战团结和进步，而企图把中国永远变成殖民地，把中国人民作为奴隶，换取少数大地主大买办阶级的汉奸禄利之时，阎锡山一手制造的十二月事变，石友三、朱怀冰等的勾结敌伪，扩大磨擦的大阴谋的暴露。都是刻骨难忘，发生于这一时期以前的血案，在这时候，我们的见面，真是说不尽的感慨、悲愤！
    我们在一起生活了约两个星期。这次的见面，我发现了公朴和以往更加显著不同的一种姿态，他的思想、意志、情绪以至各方面，假如在苏州、上海、武汉的三次见面中，他还完全是一进步的爱国知识分子所具有的单纯和热情的话，经过了陕甘宁、晋察冀和太行解放区的两年实际的阅历以后，他的一切，已经名符其实的更加“朴实”了。他看到了中国人民伟大的创造力和生活力；他看到了中国人民，用自己的鲜血所写成的伟大历史的几个新页；他看到了人民的新中国，已经在自己的国土上出现成长，放射着灿烂的光芒，我觉得他从这里面摄取了无限丰富而结实的知识勇气和新的力量。
    他热爱着解放区，热爱着共产党八路军，这人民的英明勇决的舵手，卫士和革命集团。他本不愿再离去，然而正因为他有此热爱，他说：“假如把敌后进步的生动的斗争和建设的实情，传向大后方，对那里的人民，是多么大的鼓舞，对反动的黑暗的局面，是多么显明的对照，这个工作责无旁贷”。因之，当时虽然彭副总司令，刘邓首长，杨主席等为了关切他这个进步的战友，怕回到大后方，再遭武汉事件的毒手，曾一再恳劝他留边区参加工作，为敌后的文化教育事业，作他可能作到的贡献，我也曾多番的从而表达这种诚挚的愿望，可是，公朴，终于为了要实现对解放区“传播福音”的使命，而再度南归了。当时我曾口占一绝，纪念这次的送行：
     太行深处漳水滨，
     公朴扬鞭跃马行，
     一片丹忱留敌后，
     峨嵋山月望中明。
     想不到，这一次的分手，今天竟成了永诀！
    公朴先生死了，你死的如此的壮烈，如此的光彩！你的血正和中国人民及其千百万的优秀儿女们所迸流的鲜血，凝结成一个巨大无比的火球，在照耀着祖国和人民彻底解放的前途。
    你自离太行后，五六年来，在法西斯的统治区，为抗战，为人民，为民主团结事业，不疲倦的奔走尽瘁。在这过程中，我知道你和你的家属，生活上、职业上，曾感受极大的困苦和挫折；我知道，法西斯盗匪们，也曾千方百计的，用种种方法引诱你，麻醉你，迷惑你；同时，又曾用种种同样卑劣的手段去威胁你，恫吓你和打击你。然而从较场口事件，你公开的给法西斯强盗以无情的回答，给中国人民和你的一切战友以无比的安慰说：“为民主运动而牺牲，死而无怨！”并说：“一定要为和平民主与老百姓的事业干到底，干到死。”公朴先生，这是你“七人之狱”和武汉事件的正义精神的昂扬，这是你怀抱着和坚持着两年敌后生活中，人民所给你的新知识，勇气和力量的真挚表现。而今天，法西斯所给你的死，则更可以盖棺定论了。
    爱国案中的“七君子”，第一个死于饱受法西斯的折磨而积劳成疾的是韬奋先生，而第二个则是死于同样磨折，而最后又死于法西斯的血手之下的是你。
    韬奋的死，是病死在他所热爱而又热爱着他的人民的解放区的温暖的怀抱里，他还来的及从容的要求把他的骨灰，移葬到延安；他还来的及，要求中国人民的党——共产党，批准追认他作一个党员，他比你幸运多了，可是公朴，你呢，你却在猛不提防之时，遭了仇敌的毒手，一点没来的及也按照你的遗志，安排你的后事。
    然而，我再想想，你的死，实在也是很得其所和很得其时的，韬奋先生，从他一生为人民呼号的弥留的口中，吐出了与他的人生相符合的，赤红的心——“全心全意为中国人民服务”，把自己的一切，无条件的付与中国人民及其领导集团。而你，却在中美反动派，联合加深对中国民族和人民的迫害的时候，借着空前猖狂的法西斯匪徒的枪口，吐出了你“全心全意为中国人民服务”的赤红的心，钢铁证明了你，为着祖国的独立和平和民主事业，为了人民的自由解放和翻身，你没有自私，没有自馁，你没有向敌人妥协，没有投降，你没有一刻忘记和辜负中国人民，你始终坚定不移的站在中国人民方面，尤其是你死在直接受中国法西斯和美国反动派，残暴蹂躏之下的千百万广大人民的当中，你和人民做到了“生死相依，患难与共”公朴，你不愧是人民的“公朴”，中国人民和一切的民主派，是永远不会忘记你和辜负你的！
    你是倒在自己的圣洁而沸腾的血泊里了，你所流的正义的血，将增加中国人民和民主运动的新的活力，你的血和你永远炽烈如火的心，将使中国法西斯统治区一切同命运的民主斗士和爱国主义者，更加清楚的认准了共同的仇敌，而将用着和你一样，甚至更加整齐坚毅的步伐，朝着你和中国人民的奋斗方向迈进！
    我哭公朴，然而，在我的明亮的泪花里，显然看到公朴一种不朽的荣耀的微笑——
    “我是永远属于中国人民的”！
