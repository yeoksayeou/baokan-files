What are their intentions in standing by and watching people die?
Beautiful homeland about to be destroyed, river workers critically ill with no medicine.
Even Wang He-chen of the Relief Administration could not help but admit after witnessing the situation, "Relief should have been provided earlier."

[Our Newspaper Heze Second Dispatch] Mr. Wang He-chen from the Relief Administration office in Heze, along with Mr. Wang Xiao-yi from the Yellow River Commission of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region, inspected the river areas and residents' conditions in Juancheng and Nanhua counties on the 23rd and 24th of last month. There are a total of 54 newly built villages in the river channels of these two counties, all inhabited by residents who suffered from the Yellow River flood in 1935. After the Yellow River changed its course, they returned to cultivate and build with great effort. Despite years of devastation by the Japanese invaders, their lives have been continuously improving with the active support and relief from the liberated area government. For example, Xinfankou Village in Nanhua County has more than 60 households with over 300 people. The houses are new, the trees are lush, the roadsides are full of melons and fruits, and the scenery is beautiful. The autumn seedlings in the vast fields are growing very well. However, some villages have already started to be demolished, such as Dongdeng Village in Juancheng County, where nine-tenths of the houses have been destroyed. However, most residents cannot afford to relocate. Everyone unanimously and sternly criticized the Kuomintang for not implementing the Nanjing Agreement and demanded urgent relief, requesting the water be diverted after the autumn harvest. Mr. Wang He-chen, witnessing the imminent destruction of these painstakingly built farmlands and the residents' urgent need for relief, expressed deep regret and sympathy, saying: "The actual situation is even worse than what is written in the report. Migration relief funds should be allocated as soon as possible before the water is diverted, and residents should not be subjected to floods." Mr. Wang photographed all the real situations before returning.

[Our Newspaper Heze First Dispatch] Two hundred and thirty thousand workers in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region are actively carrying out massive repair projects under the scorching sun. They are not eating enough, drinking cold water, and have no tents to rest in during the day, and sleeping in the open at night, resulting in the rapid spread of various acute infectious diseases that cannot be stopped. The Yellow River Commission of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region has recently received urgent telegrams and letters from various repair and defense sections, like snowflakes. The First Repair and Defense Section found cases of cerebral hemorrhage and deaths have occurred. The Third Repair and Defense Section found cases of cholera. In Caolou Village, 30 workers in one village became ill, with 15 already affected. Now, acute illnesses have been found across all seven counties in the Second Repair and Defense Section, spreading extremely rapidly, with a large number of workers falling ill. In Juancheng Section, 900 people fell ill in seven days, accounting for 10% of the county's workers. In Yunbei Section, 600 people fell ill, accounting for 43% of the county's workers, and the numbers are constantly increasing. The general symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, body aches, headache, and spitting blood. Although the democratic government of the liberated area has done its best to set up 11 health clinics along the river, the number is too small, and medicines are extremely lacking, causing most of the sick workers to huddle in their shacks, unconscious and on the verge of death. Qin Zhiyun from Chenji Village in Yunbei, moaning, said to the reporter: "I have been sick for six days, I have not eaten, just drank a little water, the doctor said: 'There is no such medicine here, if the Kuomintang and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration implement the Nanjing Agreement and send medicines, it will be fine'." He sighed and said indignantly: "Are they really going to stand by and watch us die?"

　　见死不救是何居心？
    美丽家园行将被毁河工病危苦无医药
    连行总王贺宸目睹斯状亦不得不承认“应早救济”
    【本报荷泽二日电】上月二十三、四两日行总驻荷办事处王贺宸先生会同冀鲁豫黄委会王笑一氏视察鄄城、南华等地河身居民情形。该两县河道内新建村共五十四个，均系廿四年遭受黄灾之居民，在黄河改道后逃回所惨淡经营艰辛建设者，虽经日寇数年摧残，但在解放区政府积极扶助救济下，生活仍能不断改善。如南华县新蘩口村已有六十余户，三百余人口，房屋崭新树木茂盛，道旁满种瓜果，景致优美，广大田垅间秋苗均极茁壮，而一部村庄，已开始折毁，如鄄城东邓庄房屋已折毁十分之九，但居民多无力迁移，大家一致严正指责国民党不执行南京协议，要求急速救济，秋收后再行放水。王贺震先生目睹如此艰辛建造之田园行将被毁，及居民急待救济之情，深表惋惜与同情称：“实在情况比报告中所写的更苦，放水前应尽早拨发迁移救济费，不应使居民遭受水害”。王氏并将各种真实情形一一摄影始返。
    【本报荷泽一日电】冀鲁豫区二十三万工人在赤日炎炎下积极进行浩大修理工程，他们吃不饱饭、喝冷水，白天无帐棚休息，夜间露宿，因而各种急性传染病迅速蔓延无法救止。冀鲁豫黄委会最近接得各修防处段告急函电，如雪片飞来：第一修防处发现脑充血已有死亡，第三修防处发现虎烈拉，曹楼村一个村工人卅名即病了十五名，现第二修防处全线七县又发现急症，传染极速，工人病倒者为数甚众。如鄄城段在七天中即病倒九百人占该县工人百分之十，郓北段病倒六百人占该县百分之四十三，且在不断增加中。一般病状为上吐下泻，全身疼痛，头胀吐血。解放区民主政府虽已竭尽全力在沿河设有卫生所十一处，但数目太少，医药又极缺乏，致多数患病工人均蜷伏窝棚内，昏迷不醒奄奄一息。郓北陈集村秦知云呻吟着对记者说：“我病了六天，没有吃饭只下去一点水，医生说：“这里没有这种药，只要国民党和联合国救济总署执行南京协议送药品来，就能行”。他叹了一口气愤慨的说：“他们当真见死不救吗？”
