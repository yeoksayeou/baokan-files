Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th – Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., over 10,000 people from all walks of life in Yan'an held an anti-civil war and anti-special agent rally at the Mass Theater, and commemorated martyrs Li Gongpu, Wen Yiduo, Li Zhaolin, Yu Shuzhong, Wang Ren, and others. Despite the wind, thunder, and scorching sun, people flocked to the event, filling the theater and the surrounding box seats, with crowds overflowing onto the mountainsides, where red flags flashed amidst the green willows. At about 4 p.m., the meeting was announced, and after playing mourning music, a presidium was elected. The entire assembly stood in silence to pay respects to the martyred predecessors.

Commander-in-Chief Zhu was first invited to speak, calling on the people of the entire country and democratic figures to unite and purge fascist warmongers; calling on all patriotic armies across the country to withdraw from the civil war vortex; and calling on the people of China and the United States to join hands in opposing American imperialist colonial policies toward China (the full text of the speech will be transmitted separately).

Chairman Lin delivered a speech, calling on all the people in the border region to work hard in production, implement the "Three-Year Construction Plan," achieve self-sufficiency in food and cloth, and strengthen their own power as a backing for the national anti-civil war and anti-special agent movement.

Mr. Li Furen, the person in charge of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League who survived an assassination attempt by special agents, expressed his respect for the convening of the meeting in Yan'an to commemorate the League's central committee members Li and Wen. He said: "Mr. Li and Wen were killed by fascist special agents for demanding democracy and peace. The Kuomintang authorities are outwardly pretending to hunt for the murderers, but who are the murderers? I dare say: those who are shouting to catch the murderers are the murderers themselves! Look at me." At this point, Mr. Li pulled a bullet from his pocket, held it up high, and shouted angrily: "This is the bullet they gave me! A bullet for the people of the Democratic League! This is how Mr. Li and Wen were killed!" (The audience shouted: "Avenge the martyrs! Abolish the rule of special agents!") Mr. Li added: "Five days before I was shot, the Kuomintang Shaanxi Provincial Party Headquarters' Bureau of Investigation and Statistics sent people to the 'Public Guidance Daily' to tell our editors to alienate me, the person in charge of the Democratic League. That was the first thing. May 1st was the second day after Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Xi'an. The streets of Xi'an were lined with soldiers and police, and national flags were flying high, with strict security. Under these heavily guarded circumstances, who would dare to openly commit murder and arson except for the Kuomintang special agents themselves?! I was dragged onto a car in front of the Provincial Library, and this car openly displayed a note from the Xi'an Municipal Government of the Kuomintang. Who would dare to be so reckless!? That was the second. The day after I was shot and survived, four special agents came from Xi'an to search everywhere. They were all from the Central Military Academy training class, and they had school badges as proof. Finally, if you want evidence, this bullet and I are the evidence."

Mr. Liu Shi, executive member of the People's Salvation Association, exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' deliberate conspiracy to assassinate democratic figures. He said: "I remember very clearly that in mid-April, a certain gentleman, one of the leaders of the Democratic League in Shanghai, received a 'recommendation' from the reactionaries to stop his activities, saying that 'it's not worth becoming a second Shi Liangcai.'" After the Jiaochangkou incident, a certain Kuomintang authority figure said at a banquet: "It's a pity that Li Gongpu wasn't beaten to death this time." He further pointed out a fact that deserves vigilance: "Now the reactionary special agent organs have opened a blacklist and are planning to assassinate democratic figures and Democratic League leaders on a large scale. We firmly oppose the Kuomintang's special agent assassination policy! We call on the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to organize themselves to protect their own groups and their own leaders."

Captain Liu Shanben, pilot of aircraft No. 530 of the 35th Squadron (B) 24 of the Kuomintang Air Force's 8th Brigade, and Co-pilot Captain Zhang Shouyi, who flew to Yan'an on June 26 to withdraw from the civil war vortex, were invited to speak. Captain Liu Shanben said: "On June 26, the Kuomintang had already issued a ceasefire order, but Chiang Kai-shek still ordered us to transport equipment to Kunming in preparation for civil war. I personally saw dozens of American-style trucks transporting military supplies to northern Jiangsu in Shanghai, and the navy sailed to Qingdao. In one week, the air force transported 75,000 people to Jinan." Captain Liu continued: "The tide of peace and democracy cannot be stopped! We have only just arrived in Yan'an, and I believe that more air force personnel will withdraw from the civil war in the future."

Co-pilot Captain Zhang Shouyi said: "I came to oppose the civil war, and today marks exactly one month. This month has deepened my love for Yan'an. I want to stay in Yan'an forever." Captain Zhang continued: "The internal heat of the people of Yan'an attracts me. People who come to Yan'an have a spirit of being selfless and dedicated, enduring hardship and working hard, and have genuine friendship and the noble spirit of sacrificing the individual for the greater good. I have been a member of the Kuomintang for eleven years, but I hate the darkness and corruption within the Kuomintang." Finally, Captain Zhang said: "Many Kuomintang air force personnel are unwilling to fight the civil war. They all have parents, brothers, and sisters, and they cannot bear to use American weapons to kill their own compatriots; however, they are in pain and hesitation. I hope that the people of the Liberated Areas will extend their hands to save them so that they can break free from the civil war as soon as possible..." The meeting lasted three hours, and finally, everyone adopted the "Declaration of the Yan'an People of All Circles Anti-Civil War Anti-Special Agents Meeting."

　　延安各界万余人举行大会
    反对内战反对特务
    追悼李公朴闻一多李兆麟于树中等烈士
    朱总司令号召国人清洗法西斯好战分子
    【新华社延安二十七日电】昨日下午四时，延安各界万余人，在大众剧场举行反内战反特务大会，并追悼李公朴、闻一多、李兆麟、于树中、王任等烈士，是时虽风雷烈日，人群仍踊跃而来，剧场及两傍厢楼为之拥塞，场外的山拗高处满布人群，绿柳垂杨中闪出许多红色。四时许，宣布开会，奏哀乐后，选出大会主席团，全体肃立，为被害诸先烈默哀。
    朱总司令首先被请讲话，他号召全国人民全国民主人士，一致团结起来，清洗法西斯好战分子；号召全国一切爱国军队退出内战漩涡；号召中美两国人民共同携起手来，反对美国帝国主义对华殖民地政策（演说全文见另电）。
    林主席演说，号召全边区人民努力生产，实行“三年建设计划”，达到粮食和布匹的自给，充实自己的力量，作全国人民反内战反特务运动的后盾。
    曾遭特务行刺未死的民盟西北总支部负责人李敷仁先生，对延安各界召开大会追悼民盟中委李闻二氏，表示敬意。他说：“李、闻二先生为要求民主与和平被法西斯特务杀死，国民党当局外表上还假装着喊捉凶手，究竟谁是凶手？我敢说：这些喊捉凶手的人自己就是凶手！请看我自己。”说到这里，李先生就从衣袋中掏出一粒子弹，高举在手，愤恨的喊：“这就是他们给我的一颗子弹！给民主同盟的人的一颗子弹！李、闻二先生亦是这样被杀的！”（台下高呼：为死难烈士复仇！取消特务统治！）李先生又说：“在我被枪杀的前五天，国民党陕西省党部调统室曾派人到‘民众导报’社向我们编辑说，李敷仁是民盟负责人，要他们疏远我，这是一。五月一日，是蒋介石到西安后第二天，西安街道军警林立，高悬国旗，在此戒备森严的情况下，试问除了国民党特务自己外，谁敢公然杀人放火？！我到省立图书馆门首，被架上汽车，这辆汽车上公开贴有国民党西安市政府的条子，试问这又是谁敢横行无忌的呢！？这是二。在我被枪杀未死第二天，就由西安来了四名特务，到处搜捕，全是中央军校训练班的，身上有校章符号为证，最后要问证据，这枚子弹和我就是证据。”
    人民救国会执委柳是先生，揭露国民党反动派蓄意暗杀民主人士的阴谋，他说：“我还记得很清楚，四月中旬在上海民盟领袖之一的某先生，接到反动派要他停止活动的“劝告”，并说“犯不着做史量才第二。”在较场口事件以后，国民党当局某要人在一次宴会上说：“可惜这次没有把李公朴打死”。他更指出一个值得警惕的事实：“现在反动派特务机关开了一个黑名单，还要有计划的大规模的暗杀民主人士和民盟负责人，我们坚决反对国民党特务暗杀政策！号召国民党统治区的人民，人人组织起来，保护他们自己的团体，保护他们自己的领袖。”
    六月二十六日驾机飞延退出内战漩涡的国民党空军第八大队三十五中队（Ｂ）２４式五三零号机机长刘善本上尉，副机长张受益上尉，被邀讲话。刘善本上尉说：“六月二十六日，国民党已经颁布了停战令，但蒋介石却仍命令我们到昆明运器材，准备进行内战。我在上海曾亲眼看到几十辆美式大卡车载运军火，开赴苏北，海军开驶青岛。而一周中由空军运送七万五千人到济南。”刘上尉继说：“和平民主的口流是阻当不住的！我们才到延安来，我相信今后将有更多的空军人员退出内战。”
    副机长张受益上尉说：“我为了反对内战而来，今天恰好一个月，这一个月的时间，越发加深了我对延安的爱慕。我要永远留在延安。”张上尉继称：“延安人们内在的热力，吸引着我，到延安的人们，都有公而忘私克苦耐劳的精神，有真挚的友情，有牺牲小我完成大我的浩然气魄。我曾是十一年的国民党员，但我痛恨国民党内的黑暗与贪污。”最后张上尉说：“国民党空军人员很多都是不愿意打内战的，他们都有父母兄弟姊妹，他们都不忍心用美国武器残杀自己的同胞；但是，他们在痛苦，在彷徨，希望解放区的人民，伸出手去拯救他们，使他们能够早日脱离内战苦海……”。大会历时三小时，最后全体通过“延安各界反内战反特务大会宣言”。
