　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: Chongqing News: Local forces in Kunming are greatly suppressed by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents today. On the 20th of last month, the Yunnan-Guizhou Surveillance Commissioner's Office and the residence of Surveillance Commissioner Zhang Weihan were surrounded by a large number of armed military police led by Xiao Guo, the head of the Special Agent Regiment of the Garrison Headquarters. Under the pretext of searching for bandits and hidden military supplies, an illegal search was carried out, and several machine guns were aimed at the main gate of the office. As a result, nothing was found. Zhang said angrily, "Even the Surveillance Commissioner's Office has been unreasonably searched. What guarantee is there for the personal freedom of the people?" At the same time, the residences of An Enpu, former commander of the 60th Army (Note: The 184th Division, which revolted in Haicheng, originally belonged to this army), the former Yunnan Gendarmerie Commander, and several progressive publishing houses were also illegally searched.

　　蒋记特务排挤地方势力云贵监察使住宅被搜查
    【新华社延安十四日电】渝讯：今日昆明地方势力，大受蒋记特务排挤。上月廿日，云贵监察使署及监察使张维翰氏住宅，竟遭警备司令部特务团团长萧国的带领大批武装军警团团包围，以搜查土匪与私藏军火为名，进行非法搜查，并以数挺机枪对准该署大门，结果一无所获。张氏愤慨的说：“监察使署尚遭无理搜查，人民身体自由还有什么保障？”同时，被非法搜查者，尚有前六十军军长安恩溥氏住宅（按海城起义之一八四师原属该军），前云南宪兵司令住宅及进步出版社等多处。
