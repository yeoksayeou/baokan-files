Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: The silk and tea industries, two of China's four major exports, are facing a serious crisis. Silk factories in Wuxi, due to excessive losses and repeated unsuccessful requests for relief from the authorities, have been closing down one after another. Currently, only Ruilun, Rixin, and Zhongnan factories remain open, but even they are losing over one million yuan per dan (unit of weight) of raw silk sold, creating a ridiculous situation. On June 29th, the silk factories held an emergency meeting and decided to collectively shut down if their request for loans remained unanswered. However, the Kuomintang authorities not only failed to provide prompt relief but even planned to purchase 150,000 dan of autumn cocoons from Japan, threatening the total collapse of China's silk industry. Meanwhile, the tea industries in Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, and Hunan provinces are also shifting to other businesses due to excessive taxes, high costs, and other reasons, leading to a sharp decline in tea production. China is the largest tea-producing country, accounting for 50% of the world's total production. Pre-war production was 4 million metric quintals, but the current annual production is 800,000 metric quintals, only one-fifth of the pre-war level.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai Dispatch: As of the end of May, only 892 factories in Shanghai had resumed operations, accounting for only 22% of the city's factories. Among them, only 71 were "state-run" factories, accounting for only 11% of the factories "taken over" by the Kuomintang. In Shanghai, which boasts over one million workers, the number of workers currently back at work is only 128,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai Dispatch: Over 1,200 unemployed workers from various places in the rear areas have arrived in Shanghai, and despite repeated petitions, they have not received any relief and are mostly living on the streets, begging for food. The so-called "2-8 system" announced by the authorities (i.e., factories should hire workers with 80% being local workers and 20% being out-of-town workers) has not been implemented to this day. Workers in various factories in Shanghai are currently promoting a mutual aid and mutual assistance movement. Workers at the Yongnan Factory saved 2 million yuan from one day's meals and used it all to provide relief to unemployed workers. Workers in other factories have also been generously donating to help their unemployed brothers. Furthermore, very few cold storage businesses in Shanghai have resumed operations after the victory, and workers are suffering from unemployment. In late June, over 1,000 unemployed workers in the fourth district of Shanghai's cold storage industry petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, demanding resumption of work. However, the authorities illegally arrested the worker representative Fang Jingping on the 25th, causing outrage among all workers. They petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau again on the 27th, demanding the immediate release of Fang Jingping.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Guangzhou Dispatch: According to official announcements, the number of unemployed workers here has reached over 50,000.

　　民族工业纷纷倒闭
　  上海大批工人失业
    【新华社延安八日电】素为我国四大出口品之二的丝茶业，已面临严重危机。无锡丝厂因亏蚀过钜，向当局屡次要求救济无效，纷纷倒闭。现仅余瑞纶、日新、中南三厂开工，但亦皆因每出售缫丝一担反亏蚀百万余元，弄得啼笑皆非。上月二十九日，各该丝厂召集紧急会议，决定若要求贷款再无结果，即全体自动停工。但国民党当局对此不仅不速予救济，反正计划向日本购买秋茧十五万担，致中国丝业有总崩溃之势。与此同时，浙、闽、皖、湘茶业亦因苛杂太多，及成本过高等原因，纷纷改营他业，茶叶产量锐减。按我国为最大茶叶出产国，生产量占全世界总额的百分之五十，战前产量为四百万公担，现年产量为八十万公担，仅及战前十分之二。
    【新华社延安八日电】沪讯：上海工厂复工者截至五月底止，仅八百九十二家，只及全市工厂百分之二十二。内“国营”工厂仅七十一家，只及国民党“接收”工厂数百分之十一。在号称有百万以上工人的上海，现复工人数不过十二万八千人。
    【新华社延安八日电】沪讯：自后方各地来沪之失业工人一千二百余名，虽经一再请愿，仍未获救济，乃大部流落街头，依靠乞食度日。当局宣布的所谓“二八制”（即工厂招雇工人，本地工人占八成，外地工人占二成），至今并未实行。沪市各厂工人，现正推行互助互济运动。永南工厂工友，节省一日伙食二百万元，全部作为救济失业工友之用。其他各工厂工友，亦纷纷慷慨解囊，援助失业兄弟。又沪市冷藏业于胜利后复业者寥寥无几，工人饱尝失业痛苦。上月下旬，沪市第四区冷藏业失业工人一千余人，向社局请愿，要求复工，讵当局竟于二十五日将工人代表方静萍非法逮捕，引起全体工人愤慨，复于二十七日向社会局请愿，要求立即释放方静萍。
    【新华社延安八日电】广州讯：此间失业工人，近据官方公布，已达五万余人。
