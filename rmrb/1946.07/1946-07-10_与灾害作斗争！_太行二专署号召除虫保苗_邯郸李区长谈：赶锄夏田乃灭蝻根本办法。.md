Fighting Against Disaster!
    Taihang Second Administrative Office Calls for Insect Control to Protect Seedlings
    Handan District Chief Li Speaks: Hasty Weeding of Summer Fields is the Fundamental Way to Eliminate Locust Nymphs.
    [Our Newspaper] The Taihang Second Administrative Office recently called on the masses in the entire region to launch a pest control and seedling protection campaign. The call first pointed out that to ensure this year's production exceeds any previous year, it is necessary to fight against various disasters that hinder the realization of this goal. The call pointed out that insect pests cause great harm to field seedlings, and in addition to diseases, badgers＠, mountain chickens, wild boars, and other animals also cause alarming damage to field seedlings. In Yanghu Village, Huguan, 70 mu of cotton were planted, and 26 mu were eaten by insects. In Sanjiaohe Village, Xiyang, more than 60 mu of corn had already been destroyed by wild boars. Regarding pest control methods, various counties have accumulated a lot of experience last year, and there are also many new innovations this year. For example, Sitou Village in Pingshun established a pest control headquarters, formulated a pest control plan, and organized labor to carry out eradication in a planned way. In the Nanyanghu area of ​​Huguan, when they saw cotton seedlings wither, they checked the cause and found that small insects were eating the cotton roots, so they immediately studied pest control methods. Labor heroes Shi Yuechang and Zhang Jianfu of the Third District of Pingshun used accounting methods to enlighten the masses and launched a pest-catching competition. Lianggou, Zuoquan, established a badger＠ hunting cooperative and rewarded badger＠ hunting. Fengjiao, Zuoquan, killed 12,000,000 field mice and 200 badgers＠ last year, all of which are good methods.
    [Our Newspaper] Locust nymphs have been discovered in various places throughout the region. Locust nymphs were discovered in Baojiajiao and Yushuping in the Second District of Licheng, Taihang District, covering an area of ​​about 15 li. Twelve mu of grain seedlings were eaten in Yan Jing. Black and yellow small patches of locust nymphs were discovered in the Fifth District of Puyang, Jilu Yu District, and some of the millet seedlings in Shiye Village have been eaten. Locust nymphs have also been discovered successively in Yuan Shangsong, Chen Shangsong, Dong Zhangce, and Xi Zhangce and other seven villages in the Second District of Handan, Jinnan District. All villages have now been fully mobilized to carry out eradication. Shahe also immediately formed a locust eradication team during the wheat harvest to eliminate locust nymphs, recognizing that if the nymphs are not eradicated, the seedlings of every family will be harmed when they become flying locusts in the future. According to District Chief Li of the Second District of Handan, the locust nymphs discovered in Yuan Shangsong and other villages were hatched from locust eggs left over from 1944. The locust eggs are wrapped in a layer of salty substance and are in the shape of a cylindrical shape of four or five inches, with the upper end about three inches from the ground. If the upper end is damaged, all locust eggs can be killed. Therefore, seizing the time to rush to weed the summer fields is the fundamental way to eliminate locust eggs. The district office has now called on the masses to quickly weed the seedlings to prevent the growth of locust nymphs.
    [Our Newspaper, Yangcheng] In Yangcheng County, on the afternoon of June 19th, black clouds suddenly rose, thunder and wind raged, and hailstones fell across the fields between the villages of Fosha and Shahe in the Fourth District to Xincheng, spanning a length of more than 50 li and a width of two li. Hailstones in Jiajiazhuang near Fosha and Shahe villages were as thick as two inches on the ground, and all cotton and sesame were destroyed, and only 60% of the corn and grain seedlings remained. Yaotou Village in the First District also suffered heavy losses. On the 21st, the Taiyue Administrative Office sent the head of the production section of the Construction Department to express condolences and investigate the disaster situation. The village has a total of 291 households and more than 2,200 mu of land, most of which were hit by hail. Cotton alone was destroyed on 110 mu, and the total loss of the entire village reached 1,159,900 yuan. At present, the village governments in the disaster-stricken areas are assisting in replanting and providing relief.

　　与灾害作斗争！
    太行二专署号召除虫保苗
    邯郸李区长谈：赶锄夏田乃灭蝻根本办法。
    【本报讯】太行二专署，最近号召全区群众展开除虫保苗运动。该号召首先指出要保证今年生产超过已往任何一年，必须和妨碍实现这一方针的各种灾害作斗争。该号召指出虫害对田苗的危害很大，病害之外，貉＠、山鸡、山猪等伤害田苗也是惊人的。壶关羊户村种七十亩棉花，被虫咬死二十六亩，昔阳三教河村已被山猪捣毁玉茭六十多亩。关于除虫的办法，各县在去年已有不少经验，今年也有很多新的创造，如平顺寺头村成立了除虫指挥部订出除虫计划，有计划的组织劳力进行剿除。壶关南阳户一带，看到棉苗枯死，便检查原因，发现细虫吃棉根，马上就研究除虫办法。平顺三区劳动英雄史悦昌、张建福用算账方式打通群众思想，展开捉虫竞赛。左权梁沟成立打貉＠社，奖励打貉＠，左权凤郊去年打死山鼠一千二万个，貉＠二百个，都是很好的办法。
    【本报讯】全区各地相继发现蝗蝻，太行区黎城二区之暴家脚榆树坪，发现蝗蝻，面积约十五里。在岩井吃光谷苗十二亩。冀鲁豫区濮阳五区发现黑黄色小片蝗蝻，史掖村黍子苗已被吃一部。冀南区邯郸二区院上宋、陈上宋、东张策、西张策等七村，亦先后发现蝗蝻，各村现已全部动员，进行剿杀。沙河亦于麦收中立即组成了剿蝗大队，清除蝗蝻，认识到如果蝻子不剿灭，将来成了飞蝗，那家的苗都要遭害。据邯郸二区李区长谈，院上宋等村发现的蝗蝻，是四四年留下来的蝗卵孵化出来的，蝗卵外面有一层咸质的东西包着，成四五寸的圆柱形，上端离地面三寸许，如将上端破坏，蝗卵即可全数死灭。因此抓紧时间赶锄夏田，是消灭蝗卵的根本办法，区署现已号台群众迅速锄苗，以防止蝗蝻的生长。
    【本报阳城讯】阳城县于六月十九日午后，忽然黑云四起，雷风大作，从四区佛沙、沙河等村，直至新城间二里宽五十余里长的田野间，遍遭冰雹，佛沙、沙河两村附近的贾甲庄，地上冰雹厚及二寸，棉花芝麻全部被毁，玉茭谷苗只剩六成。一区窑头村损失也很大。二十一日太岳行署派建设处生产科长前去慰问，并调查灾情，该村共二百九十一户，二千二百余地，多遭雹打，单棉花即被打毁一百一十亩，全村总计损失达一百一十五万九千九百元。目前受灾区村政府正在协助进行补种与救济中。
