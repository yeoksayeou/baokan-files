Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 20th (Delayed Dispatch) The CCP Delegation held a press conference at 4 PM on the 11th. Comrade Dong Biwu reported on the relief materials obtained in the Liberated Areas, and Mr. Wang Xiaoyi of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Government reported on the Yellow River levee restoration.

Dong stated briefly: According to the UNRRA plan, the disaster areas in the Liberated Areas, including Rehe and Chahar, are either entirely within the Liberated Areas, mostly within the Liberated Areas, or partly within the Liberated Areas. The number of affected people reached 16 million, accounting for two-fifths of the total of 42 million surveyed by UNRRA nationwide. However, as of mid-June, of the 660,000 tons of relief materials shipped to China by UNRRA, the Liberated Areas had actually received only 3,300 tons, accounting for approximately 0.5% of the total relief materials shipped to China. Furthermore, the Kuomintang authorities often obstructed transportation. At the same time, no representatives from the Liberated Areas participated in any relief conferences worldwide, in the Far East, or in China. No representatives from the Liberated Areas served as staff in any of UNRRA's regional administrative organs. To date, only Wu Yunfu, a representative to the Liberated Areas Relief Conference, is permitted to maintain contact with the UNRRA. This shows that the government still discriminates in relief work, going against UNRRA's relief principle of "no political belief affiliation," and this must be changed.

Subsequently, Mr. Wang reported briefly: The implementation procedure for the Yellow River levee restoration project in mid-May stipulated that the local government in the Liberated Areas would mobilize laborers for the project within the Liberated Areas. The central government would provide funds for labor and materials, and UNRRA would provide flour and equipment, with a clear deadline. The Liberated Areas faithfully implemented this agreement. Since May 27th, more than 237,000 laborers have been working day and night on the more than 1,000 li of levee along the Yellow River. To date, the levee restoration project has initially completed over 15 million cubic meters of earthwork, totaling 8.9 billion legal tender in labor and material costs. However, the government's supply of funds for labor and materials for the levee restoration has been repeatedly delayed. It was originally agreed that the government would allocate 10 billion legal tender for the first phase of labor and material costs. It is now heard that the Water Conservancy Commission only allocated 4 billion legal tender to the UNRRA Nanjing office, and the UNRRA has only allocated 2 billion legal tender to the Henan branch, which has not yet been delivered to the Liberated Areas. Furthermore, according to regulations, UNRRA should have shipped 8,800 tons of flour to the construction area by July 15th, but as of July 7th, the Liberated Areas had actually received only 2,200 tons, a significant difference. Many of the various levee construction machines were also delayed and incomplete. In the old course of the Yellow River, there are more than 200,000 residents who should be subsidized for relocation, totaling 20.5 billion legal tender. The budget has been submitted to the Executive Yuan but has not yet been approved (Note: The above labor costs of 10 billion and relief funds of 20 billion only refer to the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan region). Furthermore, Kuomintang troops in Shandong are constantly harassing and obstructing the levee construction. Recently, the government side, without consultation, personally dug and prepared to divert water at Huayuankou. If the water is diverted without authorization while the levee restoration project is not yet completed, public funds have not been issued, and residents of the old course have not been relocated, a major disaster will inevitably occur, and the government side should bear full responsibility for this.

　　中共代表团招待记者
    董必武同志谈
    联总救济物资分配不公
    王笑一氏报告黄河复堤情形
    【新华社南京廿日电】（迟到）中共代表团于十一日下午四时举行记者招待会，董必武氏报告解放区所得救济实物，晋冀鲁豫边区政府王笑一氏报告黄河复堤情形。董氏略称：中国解放区得救区域，根据行总计划中的热察两地，有的全部属解放区，有的大部属解放区，有的一部分属解放区，受灾人民达一千六百万，占联总调查之全国总数四千二百万的五分之二。但截至六月半为止，联总运来中国救济物资六十六万吨中，解放区所实收得者，据此间所得报告材料，仅三千三百吨，约占运华救济物资总数百分之点五；且于运输时，常受国民党当局之阻挠。同时无论全世界远东或中国之救济会议，均无解放区代表参加；一切联总区总行政机关，亦无解放区代表充任职员，至今仅允解放区救济会议之代表伍云甫一人与行总保持联系而已。可见政府对救济工作还有歧视，有背联总“不分政治信仰”之救济原则，必须加以改变。嗣由王氏报告略称：五月中对黄河复堤工程实施程序，规定解放区内工程由解放区地方政府动员民工，中央政府方面，供给工料款，联总行总供给面粉器材，并明定时限。解放区忠实执行是项协议，自五月廿七日起，黄河两岸一千余华里的堤工，动员民工廿三万七千人日夜施工，至今复堤工程已初步完成土方一千五百余万方，共支付工料款合法币八十九亿元。然政府对复堤供给的工料款，则一再迁延，原商定第一期工料款由政府拨一百亿元，现闻水利委员会只拨四十亿元至南京行总，行总又只拨了二下亿元给河南分署，至今尚未交到解放区。又联总行总照规定应于七月十五日以前，运到施工区面粉八千八百吨，但至七月七日为止，解放区实收只二千二百吨，相差甚巨，而各种筑堤机器亦多抛延未完。黄河故道中，应补助迁移费之居民有二十万余人，共需费二百零五亿，已将预算呈报行政院，尚未获通过（按以上工款一百万万，及救济费二百万万，均仅指晋冀鲁豫区而言），而山东各地国民党军队更时出骚扰，阻挠堤工。最近政府方面更不经协议亲自挖引准备在花园口待机放水，当此复堤工程尚未完成、公款未发、故道居民未移之情况下，如擅自放水，势必造成大祸，此责应由政府方面全负。
