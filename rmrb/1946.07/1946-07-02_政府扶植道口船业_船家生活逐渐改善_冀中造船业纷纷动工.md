　　Government Supports Daokou Shipbuilding Industry
    Boatmen's Lives Gradually Improve
    Shipbuilding Industry in Central Hebei Starts Construction
    [Report from our Heze correspondent] Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were more than 500 boats in Daokou on the Wei River, and the boatmen could still make a living. After eight years of exploitation by the enemy and puppets, coupled with various disasters, the boatmen's business gradually declined, and eventually they had to sell their boats. After liberation, the democratic government, in order to help the boatmen and revitalize Daokou's water transport, issued interest-free loans of 1.07 million yuan to the boatmen to repair 14 boats. This not only repaired the boats so that they could carry goods out after the wheat harvest, but also provided work for more than 150 carpenters. In addition to feeding themselves, each person's daily wage could support three people. The boatmen and carpenters all praised, "The Eighth Route Army has come, and everyone has food to eat."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hejian, 26th dispatch] The shipbuilding industry in various parts of central Hebei has now started construction one after another in order to revitalize inland river shipping. More than a dozen ships have been built in villages such as Dazhangzhuang and Liting in Anxin. The Baiyangdian Shipyard has also raised a large number of materials and is preparing to build various types of ships. Seventeen villages along the Hutuo River in Shenze, such as Beima and Xiuwu, have raised more than 13 million yuan and organized 35 shipbuilding teams. Nine canal boats, six or seven zhang in length, have already been built, and another thirty-three large-scale ships are about to start construction.

　　政府扶植道口船业
    船家生活逐渐改善
    冀中造船业纷纷动工
    【本报荷泽讯】抗战前道口在卫河里的船有五百多只，船家生活也还能维持，经敌伪八年的剥削，再加上各种灾害，使船家买卖日渐萧条，最后，只得把船卖掉。解放后民主政府为救济船家与振兴道口水利交通，发放无利贷款，一百零七万元，给船家修理船十四只，这样不但把船只修理好，麦收后就能载货外出。而且使一百五十多木匠，有了工做，他们除自己吃饱饭外，每人每天的工资，还可养活三口人，船家和木匠，都连声称赞“八路军来了大家都有了饭吃。”
    【新华社河间二十六日电】冀中各地造船业现已纷纷动工，以重振内河船运，安新之大张庄、李亭等村，已制造航船十余只，白洋淀船厂亦已筹集大批工料，准备兴造各种船只。深泽滹沱河沿岸北马、秀武等十七村，已筹集资金一千三百余万元，组织了三十五个造船小组，现已造成长六七丈的对漕船九只，另外三十三只六大型航船，亦即将动工。
