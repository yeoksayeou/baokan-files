　　Let Hatred Burn Fiercely!
　　Su Di
　　After reading the news about the "June 18th" bloodbath, I smelled a strong scent of blood. I thought of the thirty or forty nameless heroes who were brutally murdered; I thought of the fascist bandits hanging the heads of innocent people on the city walls of Qin County, grinning and flaunting their "victory"; I heard the millions of people in the Taihang region shouting loudly, eager to punish these inhuman fascists. Hatred grows in the garden of anger and disgust. It can turn cowards into warriors and make the most patient people rise up in revolt... All Chinese people with blood in their veins, avenge this bloody feud against the fascist bandits to the fullest extent!
　　This is a shocking bloodbath. Its cruelty exceeds ordinary people's imagination. No similar punishment can be found in the records of crimes in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Hitler and Qin Shi Huang would feel inferior. Indeed, the Chinese fascist bandits have displayed a bestiality that their ancestors never achieved.
　　This is an extremely despicable and rogueish conspiracy. Originally, when two armies confront each other, they compete in strength and intelligence. Whoever loses can only blame their own lack of ability. But because they are "isolated and resented by the people," with no reason and unable to win in a fight, they send some lackeys and henchmen, wearing human skin, disguised as "representatives" to infiltrate the enemy's interior, engaging in reconnaissance and spying activities. Then they wield their troops, putting the butcher knife on the People's Militia who contributed to the anti-Japanese war, and the unarmed cadres and masses? What is this considered? I remember when Yan Xishan launched the December coup, he said, "In order to achieve our goals, we will not hesitate to become snakes, scorpions, and centipedes." Seven years later, these "snakes, scorpions, and centipedes" have been "legalized" and "represented." We cannot complain about anything. We can only hate our own kindness and ignorance. How could we possibly think that the so-called "dignified" "representatives" sent were such things!
　　A true gentleman avenges his grudges. If we don't severely punish these fascist bandits who have no humanity, how can we uphold justice and console the dead? How can we allow the Chinese people with blood in their veins to hold their heads high?
　　Militiamen, citizens, soldiers! We spent eight years and sacrificed countless heads and hot blood to defeat a Japanese fascist. Now, the Chinese fascists have come for us. Our mission is not yet complete. Let hatred grow to its fullest extent! Turn it into immense power. Fight! Fight! Smash the heads of the fascist bandits and use their blood to commemorate our comrades!

　　让仇恨尽情燃烧吧！
　　苏棣
    读了“六一八”血案的新闻，我嗅到一股浓烈的血腥气，我想到三四十个无名英雄横遭惨害；我想到法西斯匪徒们把无辜者的人头挂在沁县城上，狞笑着炫赫他们的“胜利”；我听到太行区几百万人民在大声疾呼，摩拳擦掌，正要去惩罚这些没有人性的法西斯。仇恨是在愤怒和厌恶的园地里生长的，它可使懦夫变成勇士，使最能忍耐的人攘臂奋起……一切有血性的中国人，向法西斯匪徒们尽情报复这个血海深仇吧！
    这是一个骇人听闻的血案。他的残忍超出一般人的想像，在古今中外的罪行录中找不出同样的刑罚，希特勒、秦始皇会感到望尘莫及，的确，中国的法西斯匪徒发挥了他祖宗所没有达到的兽性。
    这是一个极端卑鄙无赖的大阴谋。本来两军对垒，斗力斗智，谁输了怨谁没本事。只因为自己是个“万民蹙额”的孤家寡人，说没有理，打打不过，就派遣一些走狗爪牙，披上人皮，混装“代表”潜入人家内部，行使一些侦察窥伺的伎俩，然后挥动大兵，把屠刀加在抗日有功、有武装的民兵和没有武装的干部群众身上？这算得什么呢？，记得十二月政变的时候，阎锡山曾说过：“为了达到目的，不惜作蛇蝎蚰蜓”。事过七年，这些“蛇蝎蚰蜒”竟“合法化”‘代表化”了。我们不能埋怨什么，我们只能痛恨自己的好心与无知。我们怎么会好意思想到：派来的所谓“堂堂”“代表”竟是这么些东西！
    有仇不报非君子。不严厉惩罚这些没有丝毫人性的法西斯匪徒，何以伸张正义，安慰死者？让有血性的中国人扬眉吐气？
    民兵们，公民们、战士们！我们用了八年的时间，牺牲无数头颅热血，打败了一个日本法西斯。中国的法西斯又找到我们头上来了。我们的任务还没有完成呢。让仇恨尽情的生长吧！把他变成巨大的力量。打！打！打碎法西斯匪徒的脑袋，用鲜血祭奠我们的战友！
