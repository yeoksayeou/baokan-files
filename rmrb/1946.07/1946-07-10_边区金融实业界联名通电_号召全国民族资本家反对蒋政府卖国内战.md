    Calling on National Capitalists Across the Country to Oppose the Chiang Government's Sale of the Country and Civil War
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Here, figures from the industrial, financial, and shipping circles in the Border Region, including financial magnate Jia Linfang, Chairman of Xinhua Coal Mining Co., Ltd., Xu Daben, General Manager of Fengfeng Limin Coal Mining Company, and Hu Zhuxuan, General Manager of the private Ruihua Bank, and 49 others, totaling fifty-two, have jointly sent a telegram, deeply concerned that the Chiang Kai-shek government persists in civil war and does not hesitate to sell out the country and national sovereignty, making China the Philippines of the United States. They are calling on national capitalists across the country to rise up and oppose this, and to save the national crisis. The original telegram first lists the Chiang Kai-shek government's traitorous acts of selling out customs, selling out inland river navigation rights, and the Kuomintang Supreme National Defense Council's passage of Article 192 of the new Company Law, inviting wolves into the house and destroying national capital. The telegram then clearly points out: "The fact that Shanghai customs' import figures for March exceeded export figures by twenty times, and that imports of American goods exceeded the total imports of all imperialist powers into China before the war, illustrates that Chiang Kai-shek has already sold out the economic lifeline of China entirely to American imperialist elements in exchange for military assistance to carry out the civil war." It continues, "Under the support of the New Democratic economic policy of the government in the liberated areas, we have achieved considerable development and an infinitely bright future. Therefore, we express our deep sympathy for the destruction suffered by national capitalists in the Kuomintang-controlled areas." The telegram concludes with a call: "Today has reached the final moment to determine our destiny. Chinese national capitalists should urgently mobilize to fight against Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous acts and struggle to complete the glorious historical mission of defending national industry!"

    【本报特讯】此间边区实业金融及航业界人士，金融界巨子新华煤矿股份有限公司董事长贾林放、峰峰利民煤矿公司总经理徐大本、民营瑞华银行总经理胡竹轩等五十二人，顷为蒋介石政府坚持内战，不惜丧权辱国出卖主权，使中国成为美国的菲律宾，特联名通电，号召全国民族资本家急起反对，挽救民族危机。原电首先列举蒋介石政府出卖海关、出卖内河航行权、及国民党最高国防委员会通过新公司法第七第一九二条等引狼入室，摧残民族资本的卖国行为。该电继明确指出：“上海海关三月份入口数字超过出口数字二十倍，及美国商品入口超过战前各帝国主义对华入口总和的事实，说明了蒋介石已经将中国的经济命脉全部出卖给美帝国主义分子，以换取军事援助，进行内战。继称：“我们在解放区政府新民主主义经济政策的扶助下，已获得长足发展和无限光明的前途，因此我们对于国民党统治区民族资本家所遭受的摧残，表示深切的同情。”该电最后号召说：“今天已到了决定命运的最后关头，中国民族资本家应该紧急动员起来，为反对蒋介石的卖国行为，完成保卫民族工业的光辉的历史使命而斗争！”
