　　　　　Wu'an People's Education Center Celebrates its Founding on "July 1st"
　　The Wu'an County People's Education Center has been fully equipped after more than a month of efforts. It has collected 8,000 books from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, more than ten specimens of natural history, and a set of wall charts and musical instruments. It also spent 100,000 yuan on repairing the houses. On the "July 1st" anniversary, more than 1,000 people, including over 500 primary school teachers from the county and active cadres and newly-liberated households from the urban district, gathered to celebrate the founding of the People's Education Center. County Chief Cheng and Political Commissar Cao also attended the meeting, pointing out that the People's Education Center should serve the people, pay attention to improving everyone's culture, unite and transform the city's intellectuals, and revitalize the city's propaganda work. In the afternoon, nine Yangko teams from various streets in the city organized performances at the People's Education Center to show their celebration.
　　　　　Changzhi People's Education Center Strengthens Cultural and Educational Activities
　　On June 15th, the Changzhi People's Education Center convened a meeting of relevant propaganda and education departments to discuss how to strengthen the city's cultural and educational activities. Attendees included the Municipal Government Education Section, the Municipal Work Team, Changzhi Normal School, Fourth Middle School, Municipal High School, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Workers' Union, totaling thirteen units. The meeting first reviewed the reasons for the lack of communication and reporting in Changzhi City, stating that it was because there were no key personnel, so the mass blackboard newspapers were not done well, and there were few submissions to Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily. It was decided that in the future, the heads of each department should be responsible for promoting everyone's involvement. Then, the work of running mass blackboard newspapers and writing slogans was discussed.
　　　　　Xingtai Yide Middle School Graduates Over Eighty Students
　　Twenty-nine students from Xingtai City Private Yide Middle School and sixty-seven sixth-grade students from the elementary school department completed their studies and held a graduation ceremony on June 25th. Section Chief Ji of the Municipal Government, Principal Wang of Xingtai Normal School, and Mr. Cao of the Agricultural Vocational School attended. Section Chief Ji of the Municipal Government stated that the government would be responsible for introducing students who wished to continue their studies, and the government would help those who wished to find jobs. The conference adjourned in a tense and pleasant atmosphere.

　　　　　Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters Studies and Improves Distribution
　　The distribution department of the Xinhua Bookstore Headquarters convened a meeting of managers from various branches and heads of various departments in Handan on the 16th of this month to discuss and decide on future distribution issues. It was decided that, in terms of editing and publishing, the company would send people to various places to conduct investigations and research on publishing guidelines based on the needs and requirements of the masses in various regions. In order to take care of readers in various places, starting from July 1st, readers who purchase books by mail order with deposits will receive a 10% discount. Future mail order distribution will become one of the bookstore's main distribution methods.

　　　　　Zhangbin Middle School Student Union Does Good Work
　　The temporary student union of Zhangbin Middle School has been established for two months and has played a considerable role in learning. It has established more than sixty learning mutual aid groups and launched a mutual aid movement in learning; in life, it has paid attention to cleanliness and hygiene, defeating infectious diseases; in production, it has launched a movement to strive for labor heroes, leading students in production. In cultural entertainment, it has launched Yangko dancing and drama performances. On the "May Fourth" Festival, it organized four Yangko brigades, and on the "June 6th" Teachers' Day, it performed the plays "Stirring up Divorce" and "Dark Family." In these movements, many learning models and activists have emerged. The formal student union has now been elected and established. In addition, in order to cultivate talents for nation-building and remedy out-of-school youth, the school has decided to expand the number of classes next semester, with one class each for senior and junior high school (both first grade), with a provisional quota of forty students per class. The school is currently planning to build school buildings.
