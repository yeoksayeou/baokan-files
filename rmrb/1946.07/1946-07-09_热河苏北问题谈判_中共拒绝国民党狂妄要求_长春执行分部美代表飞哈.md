　　Rehe and Northern Jiangsu Issue Negotiations
    CCP Rejects KMT's Arrogant Demands
    US Representative of Changchun Executive Headquarters Flies to Harbin
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] According to a broadcast by the Chongqing Kuomintang International Broadcasting Station: "On the evening of the 3rd, government representatives Chen Cheng, etc., held negotiations with CCP representatives Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu in Nanjing. The central issues were the Rehe and Northern Jiangsu problems. The negotiations yielded no results." The Kuomintang authorities are still arrogantly insisting on the absurd demand that the CCP withdraw from Rehe, Northern Jiangsu, and other areas. The CCP representatives have already sternly rejected this demand during the negotiations on the 3rd, because according to the Three Agreements, Chiang Kai-shek has absolutely no reason to demand that the CCP withdraw from the Rehe, Northern Jiangsu, and other areas that the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army recovered from the enemy and puppets at the cost of bloodshed, and to abolish the democratic autonomous governments in these areas. The January 10th ceasefire order stipulated the cessation of all military movements within the entire region, and the Program for Peaceful National Construction passed by the Political Consultative Conference stipulated "actively promoting local autonomy; before the reorganization of the National Government, maintain the status quo in areas with disputed local governments in the recovered areas." The military reorganization plan stipulated the number of CCP troops in Central China—three divisions twelve months after the distribution of the military reorganization plan, and two divisions eighteen months later. Chiang Kai-shek brazenly tore up the Three Agreements, attempting to force the CCP to submit to his arrogant demands and thereby expand the civil war, which will inevitably arouse the indignation and resolute resistance of the liberated areas and the people of the entire country.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th] Mr. Daiberlmen, the U.S. representative of the Military Mediation Department's Changchun Executive Headquarters, flew from Changchun to Harbin at 10:00 AM yesterday. CCP representative General Wu Xiuquan and two Chinese and foreign reporters accompanied him. Northeast Democratic Allied Army Commander Lin Biao, Political Commissar Peng Zhen, Deputy Commander Lü Zhengcao, Liaoning Province Chairman Zhang Xueshi, Andong Province Chairman Gao Chongmin, Songjiang Province Chairman Feng Zhongyun, Harbin Mayor Liu Chengdong, and representatives from all walks of life, totaling over a hundred people, went to the airport to welcome him. After a short meeting with General Lin and others at the reception office, Mr. Dai discussed the Northeast issue. He flew back to Changchun on the same plane at 4:00 PM. Three of the four reporters remained in Harbin.

　　热河苏北问题谈判
    中共拒绝国民党狂妄要求       
    长春执行分部美代表飞哈
    【新华社延安五日电】据重庆国民党国际广播电台广播：“三日晚，政府代表陈诚等与中共代表周恩来、董必武在南京进行谈判，中心问题为热河与苏北问题，谈判无结果”。国民党当局仍在狂妄地坚持中共撤退热河与苏北等地的悖谬要求，中共代表已在三日谈判中，予以严正的拒绝，因依照三大协定，蒋介石完全没有理由要求中共退出八路军、新四军用流血代价从敌伪手中收复的热河、苏北等地区，取消这些地区的民主自治政府。一月十日停战令规定停止全区境内一切军事调动，政治协商会议通过的和平建国纲领规定“积极推行地方自治，在国民政府改组前，凡收复区有争执之地方政府，暂维现状”。整军方案规定华中中共军的数量——整军方案分布十二个月后三个师，十八个月后两个师。蒋介石悍然撕毁三日协定，妄图强迫中共屈服于狂妄要求之下，并以此扩大内战，必然引起解放区和全国人民的义愤和坚决反抗。
    【新华社哈尔滨六日电】军调部长春执行分部美代表戴伯尔门氏，于昨日上午十时由长飞抵哈，中共代表伍修权将军及中外记者各二人偕来，东北民主联军林彪总司令、彭真政委、吕正操副司令、辽宁省主席张学诗、安东省主席高崇民、松江省主席冯仲云、哈尔滨市长刘成栋及各界代表共百余，均去机场欢迎。戴氏在交际处小后，即与林总司令等对东北问题有所商谈，下午四时原机飞返长春，四记者三人留哈。
