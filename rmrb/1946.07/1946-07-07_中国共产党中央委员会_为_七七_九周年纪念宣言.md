Fellow countrymen! All patriotic people!

　　Today is the first "July 7th" anniversary after the victorious end of our people's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. Nine years ago, our patriotic military and civilians across the country forced the reactionaries within the Kuomintang to halt the civil war and the policy of non-resistance, initiating a united national war of resistance against Japan. In the eight years of war that followed, we persisted in resistance, unity, and progress, opposing surrender, division, and regression, finally saving the nation and the people from the crisis caused by the reactionaries' policy of passive resistance, and, in coordination with the Allied forces on the European and Asian battlefields, achieved victory in the anti-fascist war of aggression. What did our hundreds of millions of people and soldiers bleed and fight for during those eight years, enduring countless sacrifices? It was to achieve national liberation, eliminate foreign aggression, consolidate peace in the Far East, and prevent our country from becoming a colony, protectorate, or a tool for international wars of aggression under imperialism. It was to realize the democratization of the country, eliminate domestic feudal fascism, and prevent fascist dictators, warlords, secret agents, corruption, and local bullies from riding on the backs of the people and sucking their blood. It was to establish domestic peace and unity, and end the self-inflicted civil war. It was to develop the national economy and rapidly achieve our country's industrialization. In short, it was for our country's independence, peace, and democracy. However, after the end of the War of Resistance, on the one hand, the people's strength soared to unprecedented heights, and they rose up in unison to demand independence, peace, and democracy. But on the other hand, our country's reactionaries, with the support of the remnants of Japanese fascism and the American reactionaries, seized the fruits of victory by various means and persisted in dictatorship and civil war. And the American reactionaries, in cooperation with the Chinese reactionaries, attempted to take Japan's place, turning China into a colony of American imperialism. Therefore, the victory of the people's patriotic war did not achieve national independence, peace, and democracy. The national crisis still exists seriously; the sacred mission that the War of Resistance Against Japan failed to resolve still requires our continued efforts to complete.

　　In the eleven months since Japan's surrender, the people's line of independence, peace, and democracy has undergone a serious and tortuous struggle with the reactionaries' line of national betrayal, civil war, and dictatorship. On August 25th of last year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's declaration first put forward independence, peace, and democracy as the fundamental principles for post-war nation-building. In order to realize this principle, CPC Chairman Mao Zedong personally went to Chongqing to hold more than 40 days of negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, resulting in the signing of the Minutes of the Kuomintang-Communist Talks on October 10th. Although the Kuomintang authorities, under the pressure of national public opinion and the democratic trend of the world, publicly accepted in the Double Tenth Agreement the CPC's important proposals regarding long-term cooperation, avoiding civil war, ending political tutelage, convening a political consultative conference, guaranteeing people's freedom, guaranteeing the equal and legal status of all parties, strictly prohibiting secret service activities, releasing political prisoners, actively promoting democratic local autonomy, reforming and reducing the national army, severely punishing traitors, and disbanding puppet troops; at the same time, they also relied on the armed intervention policy of the American Hurley-Wedemeyer group to launch a large-scale offensive against the Liberated Areas for three consecutive months. However, our people repelled the reactionaries' offensive. The American people and the world's democratic forces also condemned the Hurley-Wedemeyer policy. Therefore, with the efforts of the people across the country, under the requirements of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December of last year, and with the participation of American special envoy Marshall, on January 10th of this year, the Kuomintang authorities were again forced to jointly issue a ceasefire order with the CPC and convened a political consultative conference attended by representatives of domestic parties and social figures. The Political Consultative Conference unanimously passed resolutions on reorganizing the government on a democratic basis, reorganizing the National Assembly, implementing the Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction, reforming and reducing the national army, and amending the draft constitution, showing great promise for the country's democratization. People across the country, the CPC, the Democratic League, peaceful and democratic elements within the Kuomintang, the United States, and the people of other allied countries all cheered and supported the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but the reactionaries within the Kuomintang declared this a defeat they had to "remedy." Since the Chongqing Jiaochangkou Massacre on February 10th, the tenth day after the closing of the Political Consultative Conference, and especially since the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in March, the reactionaries have torn up all their promises step by step. When the reactionaries discovered that the American government had not faithfully implemented the decisions of the Moscow Conference and continued to strengthen military assistance for their reactionary behavior, making Marshall's peace efforts a mere accompaniment and rendering them ineffective, the reactionaries' offensive against the people became even more rampant. In the past six months, they have captured more than 40 county towns and more than 2,000 villages and towns in the Liberated Areas, and mobilized more than one million troops to North China and the Northeast. They continued to conscript soldiers, continued to use puppet troops, openly called for a nationwide civil war while prohibiting the people from opposing the civil war, openly demanded the seizure of more territory in the Liberated Areas, and demanded the overthrow of the military reorganization plan in order to expand the civil war and preserve the warlord system. They sometimes claimed that political issues should be resolved through political means, but in fact, they used force to resolve everything, even using force to resolve the moderate petitions of scholars and industrialists. They implemented an even more barbaric fascist reign of terror than before, creating countless shocking blood cases in Chongqing, Beiping, Xi'an, Nantong, Xikang, Yunnan, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Nanjing. They openly demanded the overthrow of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference in order to formulate a dictatorial constitution, and openly refused to reopen the Political Consultative Conference. Under their dark rule, tens of millions of people were starved to death, and a large number of factories went bankrupt under the joint oppression of bureaucratic capital and foreign capital. Even the middle and lower-level government officials and university professors went on strike because they could not make a living. But the reactionaries continued to embezzle, continued to extort grain from farmers, and continued to inflate the currency to supply the civil war. The reactionary tide is temporarily trampling on our country and people on a large scale.

　　Why are the reactionaries in our country able to continue dictatorship and civil war after the victory of the people's patriotic war? It is well known that this is solely due to the military intervention of the American reactionaries. It is well known that without the so-called "aid to China" from the American reactionaries, our country would have long since achieved democracy, and civil war would have been impossible to occur and continue. All the so-called pretexts of the American reactionaries, such as helping to repatriate Japanese prisoners, helping our country to revive, and helping all the people of our country, are actually helping the dictatorship and civil war of the reactionaries in our country. But why are the American reactionaries so mysteriously enthusiastic about obligatory "aid to China," despite countless accusations from the people of China and the United States? It is well known that this is because the American reactionaries have ulterior motives for imperialist aggression, because the Chinese reactionaries, who are good at selling out the country and the nation, allow American aggression to actually manipulate our country's military, economy, finance, internal affairs, and diplomacy, destroy our national production, and freely invade, occupy, and use our country's territory, airspace, territorial waters, and inland rivers. Because American imperialism is stronger than Japanese imperialism, its methods of aggression seem more "civilized" and "legal" on the surface, and it uses the capital of the anti-fascist war and the capital of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples, it can influence more traitors and carry greater dangers. Therefore, it is very clear that the survival of the Chinese nation is now threatened by the joint efforts of Chinese and foreign reactionaries; they are conspiring to turn our country into a hell strewn with corpses, a vast concentration camp, and a colony and base for new imperialist wars of aggression. All patriotic people, all heroes of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and all followers of Sun Yat-sen must be vigilant, unite, repel the joint offensive of foreign imperialism and Chinese reactionaries, and strive to complete our country's independence and democracy, and strive to realize our country's peace. Independence, democracy, and peace have become the trinity of struggle tasks for our people. Those who do not want our country to be independent and democratic do not want our country to have peace in the first place, because only civil war can suppress the strength of our people's demand for independence and democracy, facilitating their military dictatorship and military intervention. Without democracy, China cannot have true independence and peace, and if China cannot be completely independent, peace and democracy are even more empty words.

　　The Communist Party of China is determined to uphold China's independence and democracy, and determined to uphold China's peace. At today's critical juncture, in order to save the motherland's independence, peace, and democracy, we would like to make the following urgent appeals to all parties at home and abroad:

　　(1) Immediately reissue a national (including the Northeast) order for an unconditional and unlimited ceasefire, cessation of troop movements, cessation of construction of fortifications, and cessation of conscription, without exception.

　　(2) Reopen the Political Consultative Conference, implement all the resolutions of the previous Political Consultative Conference, reorganize the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship governments at all levels into democratic coalition governments at all levels, reorganize the Ministries of National Defense, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, Internal Affairs, Transportation, Education, etc., dissolve all secret service agencies, purge fascist elements, warmongers, and corrupt officials, ban bureaucratic capital, implement protective tariffs, confiscate the property of major traitors and major corrupt officials, provide relief to national industries, provide relief to unemployed workers, disaster victims, and public personnel on the brink of starvation.

　　(3) Under the supervision of the Political Consultative Conference, implement the maximum and fastest demobilization and troop reduction, completely abolish the warlord system of armies belonging to a few individuals, immediately cease conscription and return military grain, reduce military spending to the minimum, transfer military spending to relief funds and education funds, seal up all surplus weapons, stop purchasing arms, return all lend-lease arms to the United States, decline the American military advisory group, notify the United States to immediately withdraw all naval, land, and air forces in China, and declare that the Chinese people will not be responsible for all American loans to China before the establishment of our country's democratic coalition government.

　　(4) Demand that the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom reaffirm their faithful implementation of the decisions of the Moscow Conference, demand that the American government stop armed interference in our country's internal affairs, stop fueling our country's civil war, abolish the Lend-Lease Act to China, stop sending military advisory groups, and immediately and voluntarily withdraw all naval, land, and air forces in China.

　　Compatriots! All fighters who are fighting for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland! Although the national crisis is serious at present, and our struggle still has to go through many twists and turns, our future is infinitely bright. History will never repeat itself. In the past hundred years, our people's struggle for independence and democracy has never been as powerful and full of bright hope as it is today. The eight-year patriotic war was much more difficult and dangerous than the situation today, but we successfully overcame the severe test. We established and defended a strong bulwark for our country's independent and democratic cause amidst the encirclement of Japanese imperialism and domestic reactionaries -- the Liberated Areas with a population of 140 million. Today's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy is still a nationwide patriotic struggle, and the strength of the people is many times greater than it was during the War of Resistance. The struggle of the people in the Liberated Areas and the struggle of the people of all strata in the cities and villages of the Kuomintang-controlled areas are uniting into a raging fire. We not only have a united national front at home, but also a vast allied army internationally. In any case, the main force of fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan, that is, international fascism, has already been destroyed, and the democratic forces of all countries have risen up. They will eventually eliminate all fascist remnants and defeat the pro-fascist and aggressive reactionaries. Our people's struggle has received and will continue to receive their brotherly help. The American people and American democrats have stood and will continue to stand with us to oppose the reactionaries of both China and the United States, because the American reactionaries' military intervention, the Chinese reactionaries' military dictatorship, and China's civil war also seriously threaten the safety and interests of the American people themselves. And on the side of the reactionaries in our country, even with foreign aid, they still have no way to overcome their various difficulties. The current rampage of the Chinese reactionaries does not indicate their strength and vitality, but rather indicates their weakness and death throes. The fascist rule of any country has this characteristic, and China cannot be an exception. Fascism is the most ugly, and therefore the most weak and lifeless. Therefore, it is impossible and impossible for the Chinese reactionaries to eliminate the people's strength and realize permanent fascist rule. Similarly, it is something that our people will never allow to happen if foreign aggressors want to turn our country into a colony, into a Philippine-style "independent country." Compatriots! All patriotic people in the entire Liberated Areas and throughout China! The disasters of the motherland are urging us, the heart of victory is summoning us, and the great spirit of the sacred patriotic war that was not long ago is inspiring us. Let us unite more firmly and act more courageously! We have no other demands; we only demand independence, democracy, and peace. In recent negotiations, we have made sufficient and significant concessions for peace. But if the insatiable reactionaries must challenge us, then let us be prepared to defeat all reactionaries who dare to challenge us! Compatriots across the country should understand that the reactionary attempts of Chinese and foreign reactionaries can be defeated. We must defeat all the reactionary attempts of Chinese and foreign reactionaries, we must realize independence, peace, and democracy, and we must realize the ceasefire order. The resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the military reorganization plan. We welcome anyone who is willing to realize these, no matter who they are. We oppose anyone who opposes these, no matter who they are. Compatriots across the country, our demands are so reasonable, and our cause is so just. Therefore, our demands must be realized, and our cause must be victorious.

　　Oppose civil war and uphold peace! Oppose dictatorship and uphold democracy! Oppose national betrayal and uphold independence! Support the ceasefire order and support the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference! Support the decisions of the Moscow Three-Power Conference! Strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and American people and the unity of American democrats! Oppose foreign armed intervention and oppose foreign aggressors! Long live the victory of the Anti-Japanese Patriotic War! Long live the great national unity of patriotism! Long live the independent, peaceful, and democratic new China!

### 中国共产党中央委员会  为“七七”九周年纪念宣言

　　中国共产党中央委员会
    为“七七”九周年纪念宣言全国同胞们！一切爱国志士们！
    今天是我国人民抗日爱国战争胜利结束后的第一个“七七”纪念日。我全国的爱国军民，在九年以前迫使国民党内反动派停止内战和不抵抗政策，开始了全民族团结一致的抗日战争；在此后的八年战争中，又坚持抗战、团结、进步，反对投降、分裂、倒退，终于挽救了由反动派消极抗战政策所造成的国家民族的危机，协同欧亚战场的盟军，取得了反法西斯侵略战争的胜利。我几万万人民和将士在八年中间，流血奋斗，历尽牺牲，是为了什么？是为了实现民族解放、消灭外国侵略、巩固远东和平、使我国不再做帝国主义的殖民地保护国和国际侵略战争的工具；是为了实现国家的民主化，消除国内封建的法西斯主义，不再让法西斯独裁者、军阀、特务、贪污、土劣骑在人民的头上，吸尽人民的膏血；是为了确立国内的和平团结，终止自相残杀的内战；是为了发展民族的经济，迅速实现我国的工业化。一言以蔽之，是为了我国的独立、和平与民主。但是抗战结束以后，一方面固然是人民力量空前高涨，一致奋起，要求独立和平与民主；但是另一方面，我国反动派却在日本法西斯残余的拥护与美国反动派的支持之下，利用各种条件篡窃胜利的果实，坚持独裁和内战；而美国反动派也在中国反动派的合作之下，企图代表日本的地位，变中国为美国帝国主义的殖民地。因此人民爱国战争的胜利，并未达成全国的独立和平与民主。民族的危机仍然严重存在；抗日战争所没有解决的神圣任务仍然需要我们继续努力；加以完成。
    在日本投降以来的十一个月中，人民的独立、和平、民主的路线，与反动派的卖国、内战、独裁的路线，曾经进行严重的曲折的斗争。去年八月二十五日中共中央的宣言，首先提出了独立、和平、民主作为战后建国的根本方针。中共主席毛泽东为了实现这个方针，亲赴重庆与国民政府主席蒋介石作了四十多天的谈判，结果是在十月十日签订了国共会谈纪要。国民党当局虽然迫于全国民意与世界民主潮流，在双十协定中公开接受了中共关于长期合作、避免内战、结束训政、召开政治协商会议、保障人民自由、保障各党派平等合法地位，严禁特务活动、释放政治犯、积极推行民主的地方自治、改革和裁减全国军队、严惩汉奸、解散伪军等项重要主张；但同时却又依靠美国赫尔利、魏德迈集团的武装干涉政策，向解放区实行了连续三个月的大规模进攻。然而我国人民击退了反动派的进攻。美国人民和世界民主力量，也斥责了赫尔利、魏德迈政策。因此，在全国人民的努力之下，在去年十二月莫斯科三国外长会议的要求以及美国特使马歇尔的参与之下，今年一月十日，国民党当局又被迫与中共共同发布了停战令，并召开了有国内各党派及社会贤达代表参加的政治协商会议。政协会议以全体一致通过了在民主基础上改组政府、改组国民大会、实行和平建国纲领、改革和裁减全国军队、修改宪法草案的决议，使国家民主化的前途表现了极大的光明，全国人民、中共、民主同盟、国民党内的和平民主分子，美国和其他盟国的人民都一致欢呼和拥护停战令和政协决议，惟有国民党内的反动派却宣布这是他们所必须“补救”的失败。从政协闭会后第十天的二月十日重庆较场口惨案以来，特别是从三月间国民党的二中全会以来，反动派就一步一步地撕毁了他们的全部诺言。当反动派发现美国政府并未忠实执行莫斯科会议的决定，对于他们的反动行为继续加强军事援助，而使马歇尔的和平努力事实上成为陪衬而归于无效的时候，反动派对于人民的进攻就愈加猖獗。他们在过去半年中间攻占了解放区的四十几个县城，两千多个村镇，向华北、东北调动一百万以上的军队。他们继续征兵继续使用伪军，公开号召全国的内战而禁止人民反对内战，公开要求夺取解放区更多的地方，并要求推翻整军方案，以便扩大内战和保存军阀制度。他们有时也宣称政治间题应用政治方法解决，但是事实上一切他们是用武力解决，就是对于学者、工业家们的温和请愿，也都实行武力解决。他们实行了比以前更野蛮的法西斯恐怖统治，在重庆、北平、西安、南通、西康、云南、广东、上海、南京各地制造了无数骇人听闻的血案。他们公开要求推翻政协决议以便制定独裁的宪法，并公开拒绝重开政协会议。在他们的黑暗统治之下，成千万的人民被饿死，大批的工厂在官僚资本与外国资本的联合压迫下倒闭，连政府的中下级官员和大学教授也因不能生活而罢工；但是反动派却继续贪污，继续向农民勒索粮食，并继续通货膨胀以供给内战。反动的潮流是暂时在广大范围内蹂躏着我们的国家和人民。
    我国反动派为什么能在人民爱国战争胜利后继续独裁和内战？举世周知，这仅仅是因为美国反动派的军事干涉。举世周知，没有美国反动派的所谓“援华”，我国就早已得到民主，而内战也根本不可能发生与继续。美国反动派一切所谓帮助遣送日俘、帮助我国复兴、帮助我国全体人民等等借口，实际上无一不是帮助了我国反动派的独裁和内战。但是，美国反动派又为什么不顾中美两国人民的无数次责难，如此神秘地热心于义务式的“援华”呢？举世周知，这是因为美国反动派有其不可告人的帝国主义侵略的目的，这是因为善于出卖国家民族的中国反动派，允许美国侵略加以实际上操纵我国的军事、经济、财政、内政和外交，毁灭我国的民族生产，自由侵入、占据和使用我国的领土、领空、领海、领内河。由于美国帝国主义比日本帝国主义更强大，它的侵略方法表面上似乎更“文明”而“合法”，并且利用着反法西斯战争的资本和中美人民传统友谊的资本，它就可能影响更多的汉奸和带有更大的危险性。因此，很明显的，中华民族的生存现在是已经受着中外反动派的共同威胁；他们正在同谋着把我国变为尸横遍野的地狱，变为浩大的集中营，变为殖民地和帝国主义新侵略战争的基地。一切爱国的人们，一切抗日战争中的英雄，一切孙中山的信徒，必须警惕起来，团结起来，击退外国帝国主义与中国反动派的联合进攻，为完成我国的独立与民主而奋斗，为实现我国的和平而奋斗。独立、民主与和平，这已经为我国人民三位一体的斗争任务。不让我国独立民主的人们首先不让我国和平，因为只有内战才能压制我国人民要求独立民主的力量，便利于他们的军事独裁和军事干涉。没有民主，中国就不能有真正的独立与和平，而中国如果不能完全独立，和平与民主就更是空话。
    中国共产党决心坚持中国的独立与民主，决心坚持中国的和平。在今天的严重时机，为了挽救祖国的独立和平与民主，我们谨向国内外各方作以下的紧急呼吁：
    （一）立即重行发布全国（包括东北）无例外无条件无限期的停止冲突、停止运兵、停止建立工事、停止征兵的命令。
    （二）重开政治协商会议，实行上届政治协商会议的一切决议，改组国民党一党专政的各级政府成为各级民主联合政府，改组国防、外交、财政、经济、内政、交通、教育等部，解散一切特务机关、清洗法西斯分子、好战分子与贪污分子，取缔官僚资本，实行保护关税，没收大汉奸大贪污的财产，救济民族工业，救济失业工人、灾民和饥饿线上的公众人员。
    （三）在政治协商会议的监督之下，实行最大限度与最高速度的复员裁兵，彻底废除军队属于少数个人的军阀制度，立即停征并发还军粮，裁减军费到最低限度，移军费作救济费和教育费，封存一切剩余武器，停购军火，送还美国一切租借军火，谢绝美国军事顾问团，通知美国立即撤退一切在华海陆空军，并声明在我国民主联合政府成立以前美国对华一切贷款我国人民概不负责。
    （四）要求美苏英三国重申忠实执行莫斯科会议决定，要求美国政府停止武装干涉我国内政，停止助长我国内战，取消对华租借法案，停止派遣军事顾问团，并立即自动撤退一切在华海陆空军。
    同胞们！一切为祖国独立和平民主奋斗的战士们！目前民族的危机虽然严重，我们的奋斗虽然还要经过许多曲折，但是我们的前途却是无限光明的。历史永远不会再重复。一百年来我国人民为独立民主的斗争，从来没有象今天这样强大实力，这样充满光明的希望。八年的爱国战争曾经比今天的形势更困难更危险得多，但是我们胜利地渡过了严重的考验，我们在日本帝国主义与本国反动派的夹击中间建立了并保卫了我国独立民主事业的强大壁垒——一万万四千万人口的解放区。今天的要求独立和平民主的斗争，仍然是全民族性的爱国主义的斗争，而人民的力量却比抗战时期强大了很多倍。解放区人民的斗争和国民党统治区城市乡村各阶层人民的斗争，正在联为一片燎原的怒火。我们不但在国内有全民族的联合战线，在国际也有广大的同盟军。无论如何，法西斯德意日即国际法西斯主义的主力是已经灭亡了，各国人民的民主力量是已经兴起了，他们终将消灭一切法西斯残余并战胜亲法西斯的侵略主义的反动派。我国人民的斗争已经得到并将继续得到他们的兄弟般的帮助。美国人民和美国民主派人士已经并将继续和我们站在一起来反对中美两国的反动派，因为美国反动派的军事干涉，中国反动派的军事独裁，中国的内战，这些也都严重威胁着美国人民自己的安全和利益。而在我国反动派方面，他们甚至在加上外国援助以后还是没有可能克服自己的各种困难。目前中国反动派的猖獗，不是表示他们的强大和有生命，而是表示他们的软弱和回光反照。任何国家的法西斯统治，都具有这种性质，中国不能是例外。法西斯主义是最丑恶的，因而又是最软弱与最无生命力的。因此，中国反动派要想消灭人民的力量，实现永久的法西斯统治是做不到的与不可能的。同样，外国侵略者要想把我国变为殖民地，变为菲律宾式的“独立国”，也是我国人民永远不会允许其达到目的的。同胞们！全解放区和全中国一切爱国志士们！祖国的灾难催促着我们，胜利的心信召唤着我们，过去不久的神圣爱国战争的伟大精神鼓舞着我们，让我们更坚强地团结起来，更勇敢地行动起来吧！我们毫无别的要求，我们只是要求独立、民主与和平。在最近的谈判中为了和平，我们已经作了足够的重大的让步。但是如果贪得无厌的反动派一定要挑战，那么，就让我们准备着把一切敢于挑战的反动派打回去！全国同胞应该懂得，中外反动派的反动企图是可以被打败的。我们一定要打败中外反动派的一切反动企图，我们一定要实现独立、和平与民主，我们一定要实现停战令。政协决议与整军方案。凡愿意实现这些的，不论什么人，我们就表示欢迎。凡属反对这些的，不论什么人，我们就表示反对。全国同胞们，我们的要求是这样的合理，我们的事业是这样的具备正义性，那么，我们的要求是一定要实现，我们的事业是一定要胜利的。
    反对内战，坚持和平！反对独裁，坚持民主！反对卖国，坚持独立！拥护停战令，拥护政协决议！拥护莫斯科三国会议决定！加强中美人民的友谊与中美民主派的团结！反对外国武装干涉，反对外国侵略者！抗日爱国战争的胜利万岁！爱国主义的民族大团结万岁！独立和平民主的新中国万岁！
