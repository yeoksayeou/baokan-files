　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Paris dispatch: At the Foreign Ministers' meeting on the 29th, the four foreign ministers adopted the French proposal regarding the construction of Danube River navigation (the content of this construction is not yet known), and an agreement was also reached on the proportion of the Italian fleet to be retained by Italy. The French Foreign Minister Bidault's proposal to resolve the Trieste issue was also agreed to by Molotov; however, the American and British representatives requested time to consider it. Regarding the question of convening a peace conference, after a lengthy debate between the United States and the Soviet Union, the meeting passed the French compromise proposal. A French news agency telegram stated: The date of the peace conference can only be decided on the 1st of next month. Another dispatch: Regarding the Trieste issue, the Czechoslovakian government submitted a memorandum to the Foreign Ministers' meeting on the 26th, demanding that Trieste belong to Yugoslavia and opposing international co-management. The document stated: This move is of great importance to the peace of Yugoslavia and Central European countries.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 29th: Paris dispatch: Byrnes reiterated his demand at yesterday's Foreign Ministers' meeting for a date to be set for the convening of another country's peace conference, which was conditionally agreed to by the Soviet side. Byrnes' proposal was made after his direct conversation with Truman (on the morning of the 27th). According to past experience, this conversation was held at a critical moment. Yesterday morning's Foreign Ministers' meeting discussed issues such as Italian colonies, with only a few results. The issue of the Italian-Yugoslav border and Trieste was not discussed at the meeting, as it was believed that the time for a plenary discussion of this issue was not yet ripe. As the meeting was about to end, Byrnes announced that he would request the meeting on the 29th to decide on a date for convening another country's peace conference. Molotov expressed agreement, but with the condition that all outstanding issues should be discussed beforehand.

　　关于召开和会问题
    外长会议通过妥协案
    多瑙河通航问题初步解决
    【新华社延安三十日电】巴黎讯：二十九日的外长会议上，四外长通过法方所提关于多瑙河通航之建设（按该建设内容尚不悉），关于意大利舰队中保留意之比例问题，亦达到协议。法外长比道尔所提之解决的港问题之提案，亦获莫洛托夫之同意；惟美英代表则要求时间给以考虑。关于召开和会问题，经美苏双方长时间的争辩后，会议通过了法国的妥协案。法新闻处电称：和会之日期，只能于下月一日决定。又讯：捷克政府为的港问题，二十六日曾交外长会议备忘录一份，要求的港属南，反对国际共管。该件称：此举对南国及中欧各国之和平有极大关系。
    【新华社延安二十九日电】巴黎讯：贝纳斯于昨日在外长会议上再次提出召集另一国和会日期的要求，已得苏方有条件的同意。贝纳斯的提议，是在他和杜鲁门的直接通话（二十七日上午）之后提出的。按照过去的情形，这个通话是在紧要关头举行的。昨日上午的外长会议曾讨论意大利殖民地等问题，只获少数结果，会上未讨论意南边界及的里雅斯特问题，或认为这一问题由全会讨论的时机尚未成熟。当会议将结束时，贝纳斯宣称他将于二十九日要求会议决定召集另一国和会的日期，莫洛托夫表示同意，但有一条件，即凡现仍悬而未决的一切问题，均应事先讨论。
