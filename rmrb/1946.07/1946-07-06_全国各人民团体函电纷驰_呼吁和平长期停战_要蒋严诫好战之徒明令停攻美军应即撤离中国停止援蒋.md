Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Shanghai News: Seventeen economic organizations here—Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, China Agricultural Advancement Association, China Industrial Economics Research Institute, etc.—have sent telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek, Marshall, and Mao Zedong to appeal for an immediate end to the civil war and the realization of long-term peace. In the telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, they requested Chiang Kai-shek to "strictly discipline warmongers and promptly issue an order to permanently stop the civil war," and stated, "The rise and fall of the country, the will of the people, depends on this." The telegram to Marshall pointed out that China's long-term peaceful construction is not only related to the survival of the Chinese people but also necessary for the prosperity of the United States. Therefore, U.S. aid to China should be "limited to promoting democratic unity to accelerate economic construction." Unilateral military supplies, military transportation, and material leases, loans, and supplies before the realization of democratic peace will promote China's chaos. It also pointed out that "the stationing of U.S. troops in China has caused various malpractices" and hoped that Marshall "can make the most effective efforts to make this temporary ceasefire a permanent ceasefire, as a necessary prerequisite for China's construction." The telegram to Mao Zedong stated: I hope the Chinese Communist Party will make the greatest understanding to lay the foundation for permanent peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Shanghai News: Seventy-two universities and middle schools including St. John's, Datong, Zhijiang, Jiaotong, and Soochow have been widely organized. On the 29th of last month, the Shanghai Students' Federation for Peace was formally established and issued a declaration calling on students throughout the city to launch an anti-civil war signature campaign, demanding a permanent end to the civil war, the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in China, and an end to all aid to the Kuomintang government. They opposed the Kuomintang fascist faction's selling out the country for glory and turning China into a colony of American imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: Shanghai News: The Silk Weaving Industry Women's Association of this city sent a letter to Chiang Kai-shek, Marshall, and Mao Zedong on the 18th, requesting the government to immediately stop the civil war and resolve everything through political consultation. They demanded the organization of a democratic coalition government, opposed borrowing foreign debt to fight a civil war, opposed foreign troops stationed in China, opposed the unconditional dumping of American goods, which endangers the development of national industries, and expressed their intention to use actions to make those who fight the civil war repent.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: (Delayed) On the 22nd, more than 20,000 representatives from all walks of life in Heilongjiang Province held a conference in Beian City, the provincial capital. Acting Chairman Yang Yingjie delivered a speech on behalf of the people of the province, indignantly condemning the conspiracy of American imperialist elements to turn Northeast China and even the whole of China into their colony, pointing out that the Kuomintang reactionaries continued their traitorous policy of the "September 18th Incident," wanting to offer the great rivers and mountains of the Northeast to new buyers at a cheap price. They demanded that U.S. troops immediately withdraw from China, and U.S. warships withdraw from inland rivers and seaports. The conference sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Zhang Lan, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Bojun of the Democratic League, and Mr. Feng Yuxiang, Mo Dehui, all political parties, non-party democratic人士, and compatriots across the country, seriously pointing out that due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war policy, "the crisis of Northeast compatriots becoming slaves of a foreign country for the second time is imminent." The telegram denounced the American imperialist elements' armed interference in internal affairs and their conspiracy to build a military port in Huludao and establish a military base in Shenyang, calling on compatriots across the country to rise up to stop the reactionary behavior of the American imperialist elements and the Kuomintang reactionaries.
