　　Linzhang Vigorously Launches Mass Movement
　　Emphasizing Anti-Traitor Unity with Middle Peasants
　　Overturning Teams Have Used This Spirit to Work in Various Key Villages
    [Report from this newspaper, Linzhang] In order to vigorously launch the mass movement, the Linzhang County Committee has made specific decisions, calling on the entire county to fully mobilize the masses within two months, before the green gauze tents rise [harvest time], focusing on anti-traitor liquidation. In some areas, rent reduction and interest reduction must be quickly transformed. All organizations of hired peasants and tenant farmer associations should be changed to peasant associations, absorbing poor and middle peasants to participate. Addressing past shortcomings, it is proposed to oppose purely economic viewpoints and cadre substitution, and the masses must be allowed to rise up and struggle themselves and closely cooperate with the armed forces. Rectify the militia, eliminate traitors and puppet troops and their henchmen, suppress their plainclothes team activities, and make the armed forces a barrier for the mass movement. The decision particularly emphasizes not harming the interests of middle peasants and uniting more than 90% of the people to promote a new rural united front.
    [Further News] The Overturning Task Force sent to Linzhang by the Central Bureau of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region has, in this spirit, resolved to break through District One, create a model, and launch a comprehensive movement. It has now been divided into several groups and sent to various key villages to carry out work. (Li Ping)

    【本报临漳讯】为了大力开展群众运动，目前临漳县委会又作出具体决定，号召全县在两个月内，青沙帐起前要将群众充分发动起来，以反奸清算为主，有的地区还在减租减息必须很快转过来，所有雇佃会的组织一律改为农会，吸收贫中农参加，针对过去缺点，提出反对单纯经济观点和干部包办代替，必须让群众自己起来斗争并和武装密切配合起来，整顿民兵，肃清奸细和伪军及其爪牙，镇压其便衣队活动，使武装成为群众运动的屏障。该决定特别强调不要损害中农利益要团结百分之九十以上的人促成新的农村统一战线。
