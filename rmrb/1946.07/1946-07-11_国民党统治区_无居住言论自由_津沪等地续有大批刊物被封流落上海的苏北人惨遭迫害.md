　　Kuomintang-Controlled Areas
    No Freedom of Residence or Speech
    Large Numbers of Publications Continue to be Banned in Tianjin and Shanghai; Su Bei Refugees in Shanghai Suffer Persecution

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: The Kuomintang reactionaries have again illegally banned a large number of publications in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. On the 18th of last month alone, the Tianjin authorities ordered eight publications, including Min Yan, May Fourth Tianjin Student Union, Youth Century, Literary Association, Wuhuo, Zhou Bao (Weekly), and Youth Half-Monthly, to cease publication immediately. At the same time, they ordered thirteen publications, including Wenxian Monthly, Torch Monthly, New Life Magazine, Children's Life, Saturday Pictorial, Chongqing Pictorial, Industry and Commerce Life, Tianxia Weekly, Freedom Weekly, North China Industry and Mining Monthly, and Broadcasting Bi-Weekly, to postpone publication. The Masses Magazine, which was transported from Chongqing to Shanghai for publication, has also recently been ordered to cease publication by the authorities. It is reported that the Shanghai authorities will continue to ban progressive publications such as Wen Cui, Zhou Bao (Weekly), Min Zhu (Democracy), and Renmin Shiji (People's Century) in the coming days. The heads of various magazines, Ma Lunshu, Zheng Zhenduo, and others, have unanimously stated that they will unite the entire magazine industry to fight to the end. Furthermore, the Kunming authorities have recently banned thirteen periodicals, including Democracy Periodical and Democracy Weekly. The periodicals have issued a joint statement expressing their firm opposition to the authorities' persecution of freedom of speech and publication.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Shanghai News: Six to seven hundred refugees from Su Bei in Shanghai recently suffered persecution by the Kuomintang authorities and local bullies, resulting in a bloody tragedy. Last month, the refugees settled in twenty to thirty acres of unclaimed land at the intersection of Wukang Road and Xingguo Road, building more than seventy bungalows at a cost of more than 40 million yuan. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this month, they received a letter from a local man named Yu Fuquan, who claimed to be the "landlord" and forcibly ordered them to demolish the houses and move away. The households negotiated with Yu, willing to pay land rent and rent, but Yu refused to meet them. Later, they petitioned the municipal government, requesting an extension of the demolition deadline. However, the municipal government's public works bureau colluded with Yu, forcing them to demolish the houses immediately. On the 21st of last month, Yu Fuquan, accompanied by more than twenty public works bureau police officers and police, took the Guo Hu No. 303 truck and forcibly ordered the demolition of the houses with armed force. When the households heard the news, they panicked. A sixty-six-year-old woman named Xiong Li lay across the road in desperation, willing to commit suicide. However, No. 303 drove forward regardless, and Xiong Li's arm was immediately crushed. A group of police officers even began demolishing houses. At this time, the households were forced to work together to stop them, but the police officers were instigated to use iron bars and other weapons to beat them severely, causing Zhou Bujin, Lin Xuechen, Chen Yuzhuo, Guo Mao, Qiu Lishan, Song Youmao, and others to be seriously injured.
