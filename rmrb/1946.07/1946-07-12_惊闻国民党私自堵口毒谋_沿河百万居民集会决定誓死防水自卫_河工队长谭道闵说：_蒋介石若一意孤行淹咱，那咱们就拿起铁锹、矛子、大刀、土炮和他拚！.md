Shocked to Hear of the Kuomintang's Secret Plot to Block the River Mouth
　  Millions of Residents Along the River Gather to Vow to Defend Themselves Against Flooding to the Death
    River Works Team Leader Tan Daomin Says: "If Chiang Kai-shek Stubbornly Insists on Flooding Us, Then We Will Pick Up Our Shovels, Spears, Broadswords, and Native Cannons and Fight Him!"
    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 6th dispatch] The Kuomintang is destroying the Nanjing Agreement, starting to throw stones into the Huayuankou, and actively preparing to block the river mouth and release the floodwaters. When the news came, the million people of Puyang, Fanxian, Juancheng, Yuncheng, Kunshan, Zhangqiu, Shouzhang, and Kunwu counties along the river in the Second Administrative Region of Ji-Lu-Yu were extremely indignant, and gathered to discuss defending themselves against the flood and vowing to fight for survival. The 130,000 dike-repair workers are intensifying the repair of the dikes and holding meetings in their spare time. After receiving the news on the 28th, 14,000 workers in the Yunbei section held a meeting that very night to discuss countermeasures. Tan Daomin, the third squad leader of the eighth district, said angrily: "If Chiang Kai-shek stubbornly insists on releasing the floodwaters to inundate us, then we will pick up our shovels, red-tasseled spears, broadswords, and native cannons and fight him!" The conference lasted until late at night. The next morning, more than ten villages, including Hongmenchang and Wupizhuang, elected more than ten representatives to petition the government, demanding that the Kuomintang immediately stop throwing stones and transport funds, food, and materials for the project, otherwise the dike repair could not continue. At the same time, more than one million people in the entire Second Administrative Region who are working hard to produce are also holding mass rallies and demonstrations everywhere, shouting slogans such as "Demand that the Kuomintang implement the Nanjing Agreement," "Demand an immediate stop to throwing stones," and "Vow to oppose the plot to release floodwaters and launch a civil war."
    [Our Newspaper, Heze, 4th dispatch] The Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office, the Standing Committee of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Consultative Conference, and the Ji-Lu-Yu Joint General Association of All Circles recently sent an urgent telegram to Comrade Zhou Enlai in Nanjing, General Marshall, Mr. Jiang Tingfu, and Mr. Franke, protesting the Kuomintang authorities' destruction of the Nanjing Agreement, dispatching secret agents, instigating stubborn puppet troops to destroy the dike repairs, brutally killing dike repair cadres and the masses, and illegally throwing stones to block the river mouth. The original telegram stated in brief: "If this kind of behavior is not stopped immediately, then under the wrath of the public, the future is really unimaginable. We hope that you gentlemen will urgently send a three-person team to Bian to monitor the Kuomintang authorities' implementation of the Nanjing Agreement, immediately stop throwing stones to block the river mouth, and quickly allocate funds, food, materials, and relocation relief funds to facilitate the progress of the project and quell public anger."

    河工队长谭道闵说：“蒋介石若一意孤行淹咱，那咱们就拿起铁锹、矛子、大刀、土炮和他拚！”
    【本报荷泽六日电】国民党破坏南京协议，在花园口开始抛石，积极准备堵口放水。消息传来，冀鲁豫二专区沿河濮县、范县、鄄城、郓城、昆山、张秋、寿张、昆吾各县，百万人民，愤慨万分，纷纷集会讨论防水自卫，誓死争取生存。十三万修堤工人，一面加紧修堤，一面在工余集会。郓北段一万四千工人，在二十八日得到消息后，当晚就全体集会讨论对策，八区第三分队长谭导闵愤激的说：“蒋介石若一意孤行，一定要放水淹咱，那咱就拿起铁锹、红樱枪、大刀、土炮和他拚！”大会直开至深夜，次晨红门厂、吴皮庄等十余村，推举代表十余人至政府请愿，提出国民党如不立即停止抛石，并运来工款、工粮、器材，则修堤即无法继续。同时，二专区全区百余万正努力生产的人民，亦到处召开群众大会，并举行游行示威，高呼：“要求国民党执行南京协议”，“要求立即停止抛石”，“誓死反对阴谋放水，发动内战”等口号。
