Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th. According to a Hangzhou dispatch from the Shanghai Wenhui Daily, the 500,000 silkworm farmers in Zhejiang, the nationally renowned silk-producing area, are now in dire straits. In the eight years of the war against Japan, the number of mulberry trees alone cut down by the Kuomintang army has reached over 100 million (it will take at least ten years to restore them). In April this year, the "state-run" China Silk Corporation, controlled by bureaucratic capital, distributed 200,000 sheets of silkworm eggs, which, after layers of embezzlement by officials, cost over 10,000 yuan per sheet on the black market. Due to the increasing decline in production, the Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas, which produced 1 million dan of fresh cocoons before the war, are estimated by the China Silk Corporation to yield a maximum of 120,000 dan this year, less than one-eighth of pre-war levels. Now that fresh cocoons have come onto the market, the China Silk Corporation and cocoon merchants are taking the opportunity to drive down cocoon prices. Local cocoons are priced at only 50,000 to 80,000 yuan per dan. Some cocoon merchants are even refusing to accept improved cocoons, with the official price being only 100,000 yuan but the actual purchase price only 90,000 yuan, which is not even enough to cover the cost of silkworm leaves (one dan of cocoons requires twelve dan of mulberry leaves, which have risen to 15,000 yuan per dan), less than half the actual pre-war price. The China Silk Corporation buys cocoons at low prices but uses them to obtain foreign exchange. In early June, Ge Jingzhong, general manager of the China Silk Corporation, said in Shanghai that the spring cocoons from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces could produce 30,000 dan of silk, most of which would be sold to the United States, earning 25 million US dollars in foreign exchange.

　　国民党官僚资本统制下
    浙省五十万蚕农陷绝境
    桑树多被“国军”砍伐，收成不及战前八分之一
    【新华社南京二十五日电】据上海文汇报杭州通讯，全国著名的丝产地浙江的五十万蚕农，现在陷入绝境了。抗战八年来，单是桑树一项，被国民党军队砍伐的即达十万万株以上（要图恢复至少要有十年时间）。今年四月间，官僚资本“国营”的中蚕公司，配发蚕种二十万张，经过官吏们层层取利，黑市每张万元以上。因生产日益衰落，杭、嘉、湖三区战前出产鲜茧一百万担，据中蚕公司估计，今年至多收十二万担，不及战前八分之一，现在鲜茧已经上市，中蚕公司及收茧各商行，却乘机压低茧价，土茧每担开价只给五万至八万，还有的茧行拒收改良茧，官价只十万收价只有九万元，连蚕叶的消耗（蚕做茧一担需吃桑叶十二担，每担已涨至一万五千元）也不够，不及战前实际价格的二分之一。中蚕公司低价收茧，却以换取外汇。六月初，中蚕公司总经理葛敬中在沪谈称：浙、苏、皖三省春茧可抽丝三万担，大部将运销美国，可收入二千五百万美金的外汇。
