Masses in Newly Liberated Areas of Linzhang
Organize Armed Forces to Defend Emancipation

[Report from this newspaper, Linzhang] In the fifth district of this county, in newly liberated villages, the peasants have established their own armed forces during the emancipation movement, playing a significant role in combating special agent activities and covert gunfire harassment, safeguarding mass movements, and protecting the wheat harvest. In over thirty villages along the Zhang River in the fifth district, an emancipation movement for hired laborers, tenant farmers, and the poor was launched after the Pinghan Campaign. Initially, due to some neglect by the leadership regarding the issue of anti-traitors, traitors and special agents colluded with lawless landlords to sabotage mass movements and engage in covert gunfire. This resulted in the killing of the wife of Lao Bianzi, a representative of hired laborers and tenant farmers from Hua Village, and Li Yu, a militiaman from Xiaozhuang, among others. This further ignited the hatred of the broad masses for traitors and their desire for revenge. Lao Bianzi used the fruits of struggle to buy a Mauser pistol (box cannon). Li Yu's brother vowed at a meeting to avenge his brother, saying, "I will fight to the end alongside my emancipated brothers!" Young and middle-aged people in various villages rose up to organize armed forces to suppress special agents and lead the masses in struggles against traitors, puppets, special agents, and tyrannical landlords. The militiamen of Liu Louzui Village assisted the masses in more than ten villages in their struggles. In the protection of mass armed forces in the Three Emperors Temple and other eighteen villages, anti-traitor liquidation struggles were launched. The masses in more than forty villages have entered the rent reduction and wage increase movement. During the wheat harvest, the militia throughout the district organized river defenses, carrying guns to the fields during the day, both harvesting and guarding, and taking turns patrolling at night. They repelled plainclothes special agents attempting to cross the Linzhang River and ambushed puppet bandits attempting to cross the river to rob food and money on several occasions, successfully safeguarding the summer harvest. The heroic struggle of the joint defense militia has received enthusiastic support from the masses of all strata. Some large households also said, "The tenants reduced their rent a bit in the winter, but they are really concerned about this year's wheat harvest! They protect everyone day and night, and both the poor and the rich benefit." (Bing Ru)
