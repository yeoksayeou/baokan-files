　　Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Commander
    Commends Militia for Maojindu Operation
    [Our Newspaper, Handan News] Under the internal war offensive of Chiang's army, the people of our liberated areas have taken up arms to resolutely defend themselves, giving the attackers a head-on blow. After learning that a squad of Chiang's army entrenched in Maojindu was wiped out by more than 20 of our militiamen, the headquarters of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region issued an order on the 19th to commend the militia's heroic achievements, stating: "The victory of the Maojindu militia should be regarded as a new sign of the combat level of our militia. The headquarters hereby issues a notice to the entire region for commendation, hoping that all regions will conduct widespread education among the people's armed forces, continue to cultivate and improve the combat effectiveness of the militia, strengthen its construction, and make it a powerful assistant to the army's operations."
