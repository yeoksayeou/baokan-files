　　Rivers Converge into a Mighty Stream
　　——The Military and Political University's Peasant Turnaround Team Goes to the Countryside
　　In Handan City, people in yellow military uniforms with red collar badges can be seen everywhere. Sometimes they march in formation through the streets, singing bright songs, and sometimes they go in twos and threes to the People's Education Center to read newspapers and periodicals, or to the Martyrs' Cemetery to pay their respects... When they see acquaintances, they hurry back to their camp.
　　"We are from the 'Turnaround Team' of the Military and Political University, 'We are peasant turnaround team members.'" When answering others' inquiries, they are always so enthusiastic and loud, with a tone full of vitality, making people feel a bit proud. "Just imagine helping more than 85% of the population, the peasants, to turn around – what a glorious and great historical mission that is!" A Henan student named Kuang Zheng told me the above meaning when we met at their temporary residence. He said that because of his illness, the leadership had asked him to stay in school for recuperation several times, but he insisted on coming, and was very happy when his wish was finally fulfilled. His family was a small landlord. There are many examples like him in the 'Turnaround Team'.
　　The "Peasant Turnaround Team" formed by the First Brigade of the Military and Political University consists of more than 500 people. In this great army helping the peasants to seek liberation, there are people from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, from the Japanese-occupied Tianjin and Northeast, from the newly liberated areas, and also from the old liberated areas. Some are from poor peasant, middle peasant, and rich peasant backgrounds, and some are landlords... These young students have gathered together for the independence, peace, and democracy of the motherland, and today they are working together for this unwavering goal, striving for the turnaround of the peasants. Before they went to the countryside separately, I took the opportunity to talk with fourteen of them, and they enthusiastically and frankly discussed various issues, talking about their respective thoughts and aspirations.
　　Zhuang Ke of the women's team, her family is a small urban resident, grew up in Beiping, and never understood the rural situation. When she came to the liberated area last August, when studying the nature of Chinese society at the Military and Political University, she realized that the landlords' cruel exploitation of the peasants exceeded her imagination. In Changzhi, she saw some landlords who would rather let grain that had been stored for ten or twenty years rot in the cellar than give it to the peasants, so she hated the landlords and specifically realized that this was a social system problem, and she was determined to transform it. Yao Jianye, who is in the same team with her, is from Qinyuan, Shanxi. His family was exploited until they were poor when he was a child, and even the house was sold. He often saw his mother pawn the only tattered things she had in exchange for food, and the things were never redeemed! In the year he was ten years old, the Eighth Route Army came and implemented the "two-five rent reduction" policy, and his family was able to rent three acres of land to make a living. He joined the drama troupe and later went to Min'gao (People's High School), knowing how his family was exploited and impoverished. This time he joined the turnaround team and was very happy. Cheng Xi's situation is very different from Yao Jianye's. Her family is one of the several large landlords in a county town in Northeast China. She has never suffered since she can remember, but because she likes to read books such as Hugo's "Les Misérables," she sympathizes with the poor, but does not recognize that her family is an exploiter. After arriving in the liberated area last year, she saw the landlords putting on that pitiful look and sympathized with them a little. She heard the old peasant woman's complaint and fainted, and she sympathized with the old woman again... Later, she realized from her studies that the landlords' enjoyment was based on the cruel oppression of the peasants, and that the peasants' rent reduction and turnaround movement was reasonable. She was grateful that she could participate in this great historical action.
　　"I used to live a muddled life for more than twenty years, and I came to the liberated area in a muddle!" The speaker was a lively young man from the Northeast named Du Yan, wearing glasses. Before the September 18th Incident, his family was a bankrupt landlord, but after the incident, they "revived." When he returned home from Beiping during the summer vacation the year before last, he saw the opium stored in his family's Chifeng, enough for them to smoke for ten years. "Where did this money come from? Isn't it the accumulation of the blood and sweat of countless workers and peasants?" Du Yan asked and answered himself! He said that he often heard his third uncle say at home, "Everyone should accumulate virtue and do good deeds," etc. From today's sober mind, they are all deceptive lies. His great-grandfather was a tenant farmer, and he had to endure hardship even in his sixties. When his father saw him, he would say, "Grandpa, don't work on the land. Look how hard it is for you to farm at your age!" But when it came to rent, he couldn't give a penny less. He also had a paternal grandfather who worked as a coolie in a mine. In addition to his own affairs, his third uncle would always be by his side, ordering him to do this and that. In the end, the rations that should be deducted were still deducted! It's true: "Money makes the mare go," "Rich people are three generations older!" The tenant farmers and miners were exploited and starved to death, but his third uncle and the others let the rice and flour rot in the asbestos pile! Du Yan recounted the dark secrets of the old society indignantly, and then talked about how he had studied social science after arriving in the liberated area, and his mind gradually became clear. Especially after participating in some mass turnaround meetings in Lucheng, he felt that if he wanted to transform the old society, he had to liberate the peasants themselves economically, ideologically, and politically, otherwise he could not effectively oppose imperialism and its feudal accomplices in China.
　　Regarding this point, Shi Ke from Qixian also has a deep understanding. His family is a middle peasant in Yicheng County, Shanxi. Every year, the 20 to 30 piculs of grain they harvested were only enough to eat for four months, because they had to pay rent to the landlord, pay grain and money to the enemy, and pay things to Yan Xishan, handing over most of their harvest to imperialism and feudal forces. They had to endure the heavy exploitation of usury (exchanging wheat at a rate of one peck for three pecks). Last winter, Yan's army came out to rob grain and detained his pregnant sister-in-law, starving her to death!… Wang Peisi, who came from a poor peasant family and suffered from childhood, Ren Guitang, who was sold to a landlord's house as a maid when she was a child, and others, confirmed from their own tragic histories what Deputy Political Commissar Zhang Jichun said: To achieve China's independence and liberation, we must not only resolutely oppose imperialist aggression, but also resolutely oppose feudal forces, because they are the accomplices of imperialism and the culprit for stifling the vitality of our motherland. We are determined to be a national warrior who resolutely opposes imperialist aggression and dares to fight against feudal forces, and a model peasant turnaround team member.
　　Xu Liangfu, who came from the Kuomintang-controlled area last year, said: In the past, because he was not familiar with the lives of the peasants, although he theoretically recognized that the peasants were the basic force of the revolution, in practice he often exaggerated the role of his group of intellectuals and regarded the student movement as the entire mass movement. After arriving in the liberated area and seeing the mass movement in the new area of Changzhi, he changed this view (the peasant consciousness movement of only three months has completely changed the rural outlook there), and realized that only by mobilizing the peasants can peace and democracy be guaranteed. Gao Ergong, who used to be a reporter for the Central News Agency, said: The Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to maintain their fascist dictatorship, were most afraid of the peasants rising up. The winter before last, he followed Lu Zhonglin (the Kuomintang's Minister of Conscription) to inspect conscription in Neijiang, Sichuan, and saw that the lives of the peasants in the Kuomintang areas were extremely painful. The deep crisis in the Southwest was by no means accidental. At that time, many young students were determined to respond to the call of the Chongqing Xinhua Daily to go to the countryside to mobilize the peasant masses to prepare to resist the Japanese fascist attack, but they did not even have freedom. He was grateful that today, in the liberated area, under the leadership of an advanced and people's party and government, he could devote himself to this great historical revolutionary movement – the peasant turnaround movement… Under the lights, the faces of the peasant turnaround team members were shining. Tomorrow (the 13th), they will shake hands and say goodbye early in the morning and head to their respective destinations. During the conversation, they burst into bursts of laughter from time to time, and the laughter was full of enthusiasm, perseverance, and confident strength. They admitted that they would encounter many difficulties when they went to practical work, but they were determined to respond to Commander Liu's call to "thoroughly implement the land policy of rent reduction and interest reduction with enthusiastic and down-to-earth methods" and mobilize the vast number of peasants to stand up quickly.

　　百川汇成巨流
    ——军政大学农民翻身队下乡
    在邯郸市到处都可以看见穿着黄色军服，配着红色领章的人们。他们有时整队唱着＠亮的歌子从街上穿过，有时三个两个地到民教馆里阅览书报，或者到烈士陵园纪奠一下………看看熟人，便又匆匆地回到宿营地里去了。
    “我们是军政大学‘翻身队’的，‘我们是农民翻身队员’。他们回答别人的询问时，总是那么热情，那么响亮，语气里充满着活力，使人听了感到多少有些骄矜的成份。‘试想一下帮助人口中百分之八十五以上的农民翻身，该是一件多么光荣、多么伟大的历史使命啊’！一位叫匡正的河南同学，在他们临时驻地见面时告诉我上面的意思，他说：因为有病，领导上几次叫他留在校里休养，他却坚持着要来，终于如愿以偿，心里非常高兴。他的家庭是个小地主。像他这样的例子，‘翻身队’里还不少。”
    军政大学一大队组成的“农民翻身队”，一共五百多人。在这支帮助农民求解放的大军中，有来自国民党统治区的，有来自日寇统治时的平津东北的，有来自新解放区的，也有来自老解放区的。有贫农、中农、富农出身的，也有是地主的。……这些青年同学们，为着祖国的独立和平与民主而汇集在一起，今天更为这个确定不移的目标，共同去为农民的翻身而努力。在他们没有分头下乡之前，我曾找了个机会，和他们之中的十四位同学谈过话，他们热情而坦率的谈论着各种问题，谈着各自的感想和抱负。
    女生队的庄柯，她家庭是个小市民，从小就在北平长大，对农村情形一向不了解，去年八月到解放区，在军政大学学中国社会性质时，才知道地主对农民酷重的剥削，超过自己想像之外。在长治看见有些地主宁愿叫存放十年二十年的粮食，在地窖里烂了也不给农民，便憎恨地主，并具体认识到这是社会制度问题，决心要改造它。和她同队的姚建业，山西沁源人，小时家庭被剥削光了，连房子也卖掉，常见母亲将仅有的破烂东西押出去，换粮食吃，东西永也没钱赎回来！十岁那年来了八路军，实行二五减租，家里又才租种了三亩地才能过活。自己参加了剧团，后来又到民高上学，知道自己家是怎样被剥削穷的，这次参加翻身队，很高兴。程西的情况和姚建业炯然不同，她家是东北某县城里几个大地主中之一，自己从记事时起，便没吃过苦，但因爱看嚣俄“悲惨世界”等小说，对穷人很同情，却不认识自己家庭是剥削者。去年到解放区后，看见地主装成那副可怜相，有点同情他，听农民老太太诉苦昏绝过去，又同情老太太……后来从学习中才认识到，地主享受是建筑在对农民残酷的压榨的基础上的，农民减租息闹翻身运动是合理的，庆幸自己能参加这次伟大的历史行动。
    “我过去迷里迷糊活了二十多岁，又迷里迷糊到解放区来”！说话的是一位戴眼镜，性情活泼的东北青年，名字叫杜焱。他家在九一八事变前是个破落地主，事变后又曾“中兴”起来，前年暑期从北平回家时，看到家里所存的赤峰烟土，足够他们十年抽，“这些钱都是从那里来的呢？还不是无数工人农民血汗的积垒吗”！杜焱自问自答地说着！他说他在家时常听见三叔说，“凡人都要积德行善啦”等等，从今天清醒的头脑来看，都是些骗人的鬼话。他大爷爷是个佃户，六十多岁还得受死受活的，叫父亲看见了便说“大爷不要上地了，你看你这年纪种地多苦”！但是要租时却连一个铜子也不能少给。他还有个本家祖父在矿上当苦力工人，除了他份内的事，三叔还整天在旁边三爷长三爷短地，支使他作这作那，到头来该扣配给品仍扣配给品！真是：“有钱能使鬼推磨”，“有钱人大三辈”！佃户矿工们被压榨得穷病饿死，三叔他们却让大米白面在石棉堆里全乌烂了！杜焱愤愤不平地叙述着旧社会的黑幕，又谈起到解放区后学习了社会科学，头脑才慢慢清醒起来，特别是在潞城参加了些群众翻身会后，觉得要想改造旧社会，非得使农民自身在经济上、思想上、政治上救得解放不可，否则就不能有力的反对帝国主义，和她在中国的封建帮凶。
    关于这点，七县的史可也有着深切的认识，他家在山西翼城县，是个中农，每年打二三十石粮食只够四个月吃，因为一来要给地主出些租，二来要给敌人出粮出款，三来还要给阎锡山出东西，把收获中的大部都交给了帝国主义与封建势力，自己只好忍受着惨重的高利贷剥削（一斗三斗地揭麦账），去年冬天阎军出来抢粮，把快生小孩的嫂嫂扣押起来，活活地饿死了！………自幼受苦受穷贫农家庭出身的王培思，小时被卖到地主家里当使女的任桂棠等，更从自己悲惨的历史中证实了张际春副政委的话：要求得中国的独立解放，不仅要坚决反对帝国主义的侵略，而且要坚决反对封建势力，因为它是帝国主义的帮凶，窒息我们祖国生机的罪魁。决心作一个坚决反对帝国主义侵略，同时勇于与封建势力搏斗的民族战士、一个模范的农民翻身队员。
    去年来自国民党统治区的许亮夫说：过去由于对农民生活不熟悉，理论上虽承认农民是革命的基本力量，而实际下却往往把自己这群知识分子的作用夸大起来，把学生运动当成全部群众运动。到了解放区，看到长治新区的群众运动后才转变了这种观点，（仅仅三个月的农民自觉运动，已使那里的农村面貌全部改观），认识到只有把农民发动起来，和平民主才有保障。曾在中央社当记者的高而公说：国民党反动派为了维持其法西斯的独裁统治，它是最害怕农民起来的，前年冬天他曾随鹿钟麟（国民党的兵役部长），至四川内江一带视察兵役，看见国民党区域内农民生活是极端痛苦的。大西南危机那样深重绝非偶然的事，那时很多青年学生有志响应重庆新华日报的号召，下乡发动农民群众准备迎击日本法西斯进攻连自由也没有，他庆幸自己今日在解放区能在先进的、人民的政党与政府领导之下，投身到这个伟大的历史的革命运动——农民翻身运动中去。……电灯下，农民翻身队员，个个脸上都闪耀着光辉。明天（十三日），他们清早就要握手话别，分头向各自的目的前进了，谈话间，他们不时掀起阵阵的欢笑，笑声里充满着热情、坚毅与自信的力量。他们承认到实际工作中去时，将要遇到许多困难，但是他们决心响应刘司令员的号召，以“热情踏实的作法，彻底执行减租减息的土地政策”，发动广大农民迅速站立起来。
