　　Handan, 20th – The spokesperson of the Jinji-Luyu Border Region Relief Branch made a statement regarding UNRRA's "relief" work in the border region, stating:

　　The 30 million people in the border region are extremely dissatisfied and indignant at UNRRA's so-called "relief" work in the border region. This is because it not only completely violates the agreement of "relieving disaster victims in the Communist areas regardless of race, religion, or political views," and obstructs and sabotages relief to the liberated areas in every possible way, but also uses "relief" directly as a tool to expand the civil war—including supporting puppet troops and sending special agents disguised as representatives to sneak into the liberated areas to conduct reconnaissance activities, coordinate with Chiang and Yan's armies in their massive offensive, and create shocking bloodshed. We know that fair-minded people within UNRRA are also dissatisfied with this unreasonable phenomenon.

　　The spokesperson stated: The border region has a population of 30 million. After eight years of the War of Resistance and four years of natural disasters, there are currently about four million disaster victims in urgent need of relief. After more than half a year of appeals and lobbying, and after UNRRA organized a number of personnel to investigate and inspect, only the people in 12 counties in northern Henan have received 12,000 bags of flour (as far as is known, 2,000 of the 4,000 bags of flour received by the four counties including Hua County have already rotted), 120 bundles of clothing, 18 million yuan in seed loan legal tender, and 12 boxes of medicine and gauze. The Shandong, southern Hebei, and Shanxi portions belonging to this border region have not received any UNRRA material relief. The Kuomintang government uses every means to obstruct and sabotage relief to the liberated areas, and even block and isolate our relief personnel from contacting UNRRA representatives. For example, the Shandong part of this region has repeatedly sent people to Linyi to contact UNRRA in Qingdao, but the Kuomintang has not allowed them to pass. Later, the head of UNRRA in Qingdao personally went to Linyi to meet with our representatives and stated that Qingdao had shipped materials and intended to distribute them to the refugees in the Jinji-Luyu border region, but the Kuomintang did not allow them to be imported into the liberated areas, falsely accusing the relief to the people in the liberated areas of "aiding the enemy." In Shanxi: Mr. An Dingyuan, an UNRRA inspector, came to the border region very early to inspect and understand the actual situation of the refugees. After consultation with the Taiyuan Executive Headquarters, 800 small carts of clothing, medicine, milk, etc. were transported to Changzhi. However, just after they were transported out of Qin County for a little over ten miles, they were robbed by the puppet troops of Duan Bingchang's unit under the command of Yan Xishan. Upon hearing the news, Mr. An rushed to Qin County overnight to negotiate, but the puppet troops refused to release the materials on the grounds that they could not be transported. On June 8, Mr. An came to Wuxiang again to discuss the organization of transportation with us. Li Qingyi, a representative from Yan's side, came with him under the pretense of liaison, but in reality, he was conducting espionage activities. After Li Qingyi returned to Qin County from Wuxiang, he immediately led Duan Bingchang's puppet troops to surround 18 villages including Qingxiu in Wuxiang, and arrested more than 640 residents of our liberated area, killing 37 people in an unprecedentedly cruel manner. In southern Hebei: After eight years of the War of Resistance and four years of famine, most of the land was barren under the destruction of the enemy's "three alls policy." For example, the eight laborers of the mutual aid group in Beisitou Village, Quzhou, only had two hoes and four sickles, which were purchased with loans from the democratic government. West of Weishan Lake, a large area had no harvest in the wheat season. The upper reaches of the Fuyang River in Ren County, Nanhe, and the upper reaches of the Wei River in Daming and Wei County suffered floods this year, resulting in significant losses. In Daming and Wei County alone, 70,000 people are in urgent need of relief. However, except for the people in Yongnian City who received 300,000 jin of grain relief, no money or grain has been received in other areas to this day. Moreover, the grain used to relieve Yongnian City was the product of the hard work of the people in this region, and the transportation costs were also advanced by us. The UNRRA materials used to repay the grain price and transportation costs were obstructed by the Kuomintang government and could not be purchased and transported, so the legal tender was still repaid in the end. Before the puppet troops in Dongming laid down their weapons, the Pingjin Branch decided to allocate 200 to 300 tons of flour, which had already been transported to Kaifeng. When the puppet troops in Dongming City laid down their weapons, these relief materials were not given. Comrade Gao Buqing of the Border Region Relief Branch went to negotiate, and fair-minded people in the Kaifeng Branch also tried their best to help transport, but the Pingjin Branch initially stated: Only the work team of the branch is allowed to transport it. Then, it said: According to the telegram from the Executive Yuan, it refused to transport the materials to Dongming City after liberation before the Eighth Route Army withdrew from Dongming. Obviously, the so-called relief from UNRRA and the Pingjin Branch was not to relieve the people in Dongming City, but to relieve the puppet troops in Dongming. The Kuomintang government used UNRRA relief materials as a political tool, which can also be clearly seen from the Dongming relief issue.

　　Our border region has tried its best to fulfill almost all the requirements of UNRRA. Taking the return of refugees to their hometowns as an example, since this spring, those who have come from Anyang North and passed through our liberated areas have been taken care of in every possible way, providing food and accommodation for all refugees, and some have even been given travel expenses and food. A total of more than a thousand people have passed through from south to north, and even disguised Kuomintang "demobilized" soldiers and other disguised refugees have been provided with convenience. It is heard that UNRRA is still considering how refugees can pass through the liberated areas to return to their hometowns, but in fact, we have already been doing it, because this is the Chinese government's business with the people, and we will never neglect our responsibility. We have done everything else that UNRRA has asked of us, but the relief received by the vast number of disaster victims in this region is like this. The Peiping Agreement decided: "After relieving the hungry refugees in Yongnian City, immediately relieve the liberated areas." To this day, it remains empty talk on paper. In addition, in the 13 counties in northern Henan claimed to be "ruled" by the Kuomintang, although the cities are ruled by the Kuomintang, most of the villages in many counties belong to the liberated areas. Taking Anyang as an example: the Kuomintang rulers are no more than 250,000 people, while the liberated areas under the leadership of the CCP have 450,000 people. However, all the materials used to relieve Anyang are swallowed up by the Kuomintang, and the people in the liberated areas of Anyang have not received a penny. This unfair phenomenon is exactly the same in the above-mentioned 13 counties in northern Henan.

　　What the people of our border region hope from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is: to carry out fair relief to the liberated areas in accordance with the regulations in a practical and rapid manner. Every grain of rice, every piece of clothing, and every pill shipped by UNRRA is the relief of the great friendship of international friends who love peace to the Chinese people. It is absolutely not allowed for the Kuomintang government to embezzle and enrich itself. The Kuomintang government uses relief materials as a political tool, and it is hoped that UNRRA will take effective measures to stop it. We demand that the relief organizations at all levels be changed immediately, and that representatives of the people in the liberated areas be absorbed to participate, so as to rationally and fairly distribute the relief materials. This is the unanimous demand of the people in our entire liberated area and even the whole country. It is hoped that UNRRA will give it deep consideration, and it is hoped that the people in the entire liberated area and the whole of China will strive for it together.

　　反对蒋政府贪污中饱扩大内战
    要求公平救济改组行总
    晋冀鲁豫救济分会发言人谈称
    解放区代表应参加各级救济机构
    【邯郸二十日电】晋冀鲁豫边区救济分会发言人关于“行总”对本边区之“救济”工作发表谈话称：
    边区三千万人民，对于行总对边区之所谓“救济”工作，是极端不满与愤慨的。因为它不但完全违背了“不分种族宗教及政见，救济共产党区域内的灾难民”的约言，千方百计的阻碍破坏对解放区的救济，而且以“救济”直接作为扩大内战的工具——包括支援伪军及派遣特务混充代表，潜入解放区侦察活动，策应蒋阎军大举进攻，制造惊人血案在内。我们知道对于这种不合理的现象，联总方面的公正人士也是不满意的。
    发言人称：边区拥有三千万人口，经过八年抗战，四年天灾，现有急待救济的灾难民约四百万人，经过半年多之奔走呼号，经过联总组织不少人员之调查巡视，但直至今日在全区一百九十三个县份中，只豫北十二县人民得到面粉一万二千袋（仅就所知，滑县等四个县所得到的四千袋面粉，有二千袋业已霉烂），衣服一百二十包，种子贷金法币一千八百万元，药品及纱布十二箱。其他属于本边区之山东、冀南、山西部分，均未获得联总任何物资的救济。国民党政府用一切方法来阻挠破坏救济解放区，甚至多方封锁隔断我救济人员与联总代表之接触。如本区所属山东部分，曾屡次派人去临沂拟赴青岛与联总接洽，而国民党不准通过，后来青岛联总负责人亲往临沂与我方代表接头，并表示青岛曾运到了物资，拟分配给晋冀鲁豫边区难民，但国民党不准输入解放区，并诬称救济解放区人民为“资敌”。山西方面：很早就经过联总检查官安定远先生前来边区视察与了解难民实际情况，后经与太原执行小组商妥，运往长治衣服、药品、牛奶等八百辆小车，但刚运出沁县不过十里许，即被阎锡山指挥下的伪军段炳昌部抢走。安先生闻讯，星夜赶到沁县交涉，伪军竟以无法运输为辞，扣押物资不放。六月八日，安先生复来武乡与我商谈组织运输，阎方代表李庆一同来，表面上借口联络，实际则是进行特务活动。李庆一从武乡返回沁县后，立即引导伪军段炳昌部包围武乡青修等十八个村庄，捕去我解放区居民六百四十余名，以空前残忍的方法，杀死卅七人。在冀南方面：经过八年抗战，四年灾荒，在敌寇“三光政策”摧残下，大部土地荒芜。如曲周北寺头村互助小组八个劳动力，只有两张锄四张镰，还是由民主政府贷款购来的，微山湖西，广大地区麦季无收成。滏阳河上游任县南和及卫河上游，大名魏县今年又遭水灾，损失甚巨，仅大名魏县就有七万人民急待救济。但冀南区除永年城人民得到粮食救济三十万斤，其他地区至今尚未获得一文钱一粒米，而救济永年城的这些粮食，还是本区人民血汗劳作的生产品，运费也是由我们垫借的，联总用以偿付粮价及运费之物资，为国民党政府所阻挠不得购运，结果仍是偿还了法币。东明伪军未放下武器前，平津分署决定分配给二百到三百吨面粉，已经运到开封。当东明城内伪军放下武器时，这些救济物资就不给了。边区救济分会高步青同志曾前往接洽，开封分署公正人士亦竭力帮助运输，但平津分署初则表示：必须有该署之工作队才准运去，继之又说：接行政院电令，在八路军未退出东明前，拒绝将物资运往解放后的东明城。很显然的，行总暨平津分署的所谓救济，不是救济东明城内的老百姓，而是为了救济东明的伪军。国民党政府将联总救济物资用作政治工具，从东明救济问题上，也可以看得明明白白。
    我们边区对联总行总的一切要求几乎无不尽力为之，以难民还乡而言，今春以来，从安阳北来，经过我解放区者，均多方照顾，供给所有难民食宿，部分的还发给路费粮食，由南而北已通过者前后共达千余人，甚至伪装的国民党“复员”军人及其他伪装之难民，均给以便利。闻联总还在考虑难民还乡如何通过解放区的问题，实际我们早已在作，因为这是中国政府对人民的事，我们决不有忽责任。其他联总所要求于我者我已一一作到，但本区广大灾难民所得到之救济则如此。北平协定曾决定：“救济永年城内受饥饿之难民后，立即救济解放区”至今仍成为纸上空文。又豫北国民党所称“统治之十三县中，城市虽为国民党所统治，而许多县份的大部乡村则属于解放区，以安阳为例：国民党统治者不过二十五万人，中共领导下的解放区达四十五万人，而救济安阳之物资，全部为国民党所独吞，安阳解放区人民则未获得分文。这种不公平现象，在上述豫北十三县中，情况完全如此。
    我们边区人民希望于联合国善后救济总署者：按照规章，切实而迅速的对解放区进行公平的救济。联总所运来之一粒米，一件衣服，一个药片，都是爱好和平的国际友人，对中国人民伟大友谊的救济，如国民党政府贪污中饱，是绝对不允许的。国民党政府将救济物资充作政治工具，希望联总采取有效的制止办法。我们要求立即变更各级救济机构，吸收解放区人民代表参加，以便合理公平的分配救济物资，这是我们全解放区甚至全国人民一致的主张，希望联总深加考虑，并望全解放区全中国人民一致力争。
