　　Orphans Return Home, Houses Rebuilt
    Enemy and Puppet Regime Created Famine Forcing People to Abandon Children and Leave Their Hometowns; Democratic Government Reduced Rent and Increased Wages, Leading to New Family Joys
    [This newspaper's Changzhi, 14th dispatch] The Jiaozuo City "Orphanage" has been closed, and twenty orphans have returned to their own warm homes. During the famine years caused by the enemy and puppet regime's rule in the city of Jiaozuo, a large number of refugees abandoned their young children and fled to escape the famine. The enemy and puppet regime, in order to win people's hearts and decorate their image, took in a very small number of orphans and established a so-called "Orphanage." In name, it was stipulated that each child would receive one jin of fine grain per day, but in reality, it was one jin of coarse grain, and even that was not always received. The orphans were all so hungry that they were pale and emaciated, on the verge of death. After our liberation of Jiaozuo, we immediately treated the orphans favorably. In addition to the one jin of fine grain, we also increased it by four liang of millet per day. The orphans quickly became white and chubby and very cute. Even more gratifying is that due to the prosperity of industrial and commercial construction, the masses have been emancipated through rent reduction, wage increases, and loan relief. Most of the refugees who fled the famine have returned one after another, rebuilding their families with the help of the government, and now have food and clothing. The parents of the orphans came to the orphanage one after another to look for their children. When they saw their white and chubby children, they were all moved to tears, sincerely calling the democratic government their "savior." They happily took their children away. Three orphans who could not find their parents have been adopted as adopted sons by parents who could not find their children and taken home.

　　孤儿重归家屋再建
    敌伪制造灾荒逼民抛子离乡民主政府减租增资天伦新欢
    【本报长治十四日电】焦作市“孤儿院”已告结束，二十个孤儿重回自己温暖家庭。该市在敌伪统治时所造成的灾荒年月里，大量难民扔弃了自己幼小的子女，出外逃荒。敌伪为拢络人心装璜门面，收容极少数孤儿，成立所谓“孤儿院”。名义上规定每儿每日发给一斤细粮，实际是一斤粗粮，还领不到，孤儿们都饿得面黄饥瘦，奄奄待毙。我解放焦作后，立即优待孤儿，除一斤细粮照发外，每日又增加四两小米，孤儿们很快都变得白胖可爱。更可喜的是由于工商业建设的繁荣，群众在减租增资与贷款救济中获得翻身，大部逃荒难民陆续返回，在政府帮助下重建家庭，有了吃穿。孤儿的父母纷纷到孤儿院找寻自己的子女。当他们看到自己白胖的孩子时，都感激落泪，衷心地称呼民主政府为“救命恩人”。高高兴兴的把自己孩子领走，有三个找不到父母的孤儿，已由找不到孩子的父母收为义子，领回家去。
