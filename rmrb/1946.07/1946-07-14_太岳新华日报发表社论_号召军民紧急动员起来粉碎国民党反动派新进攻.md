　　Taiyue Xinhua Daily Publishes Editorial
　　Calling on the Military and Civilians to Immediately Mobilize to Crush the New Offensive of the Kuomintang Reactionaries
　　[Reported from Yangcheng by this newspaper] The Taiyue Xinhua Daily published an editorial on the 9th, calling on the people of the entire region to "immediately mobilize and crush the new offensive of the Kuomintang reactionaries." The editorial first pointed out the current tense situation in Taiyue, stating: The new large-scale offensive by the Chiang-Yan troops against us has already begun. At the beginning of the month, the 27th Army and 47th Division, concentrated in the Shanzhou area, have crossed the river and occupied villages along the Zhang (dian) - Mao (jin) highway. They are currently receiving assistance from Chiang's troops in Anyi and Yuncheng, and subsequent troops are continuing to move north (as reported on page one of this newspaper on the 12th). The two divisions of Chiang-Yan troops at Fen Nan Jishan are also preparing to coordinate from north and south, launching a major offensive against our Jinan Liberated Area. The Kuomintang 53rd Division, entrenched in Jiyuan and Meng County in northern Henan, is also actively preparing to coordinate an offensive with the assistance of Kuomintang aircraft. In the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, around Pingyao, more than 2,000 Yan troops began attacking us on the 6th. The seven regiments of Yan troops gathered from Taigu and Yuci along the Baijin-Dongqin line also launched a fierce offensive against us on the 7th. Therefore, defending China's independence, peace, and democracy, and safeguarding the victory of the Taiyue people's liberation, is an urgent combat task for our region's Party, government, military, and civilians. Next, the editorial called on the entire region to: First, conduct in-depth anti-civil war mobilization, strengthen combat will, overcome complacency and paralysis, accelerate war preparations, and complete all preparations for victory on the front lines. Second, under any circumstances, we must resolutely mobilize the masses and lead production work, which is the material basis for consolidating the liberated areas and ensuring victory in the anti-civil war. Third, we must launch a mass anti-espionage campaign and strengthen public security and air defense work. Fourth, in the border areas, we must widely launch mass guerrilla warfare and demolition movements, strengthen the struggle to protect grain, implement a scorched-earth policy, and militia platoons should intensify training on the spot. The core areas should intensify logistical work and carry forward the valuable experience of past wars to resolutely strike back against invaders.
