　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 7th: Moscow News: Soviet heavy industry production is developing at a tremendous speed. In terms of steel production, the largest European steel rolling mill, the "Azovstal" factory, has reopened and will exceed pre-war output by the end of this year. By 1948, the factory will produce 9.9 million tons of steel sheets and coils annually, enough to supply the annual needs of five huge tractor-automobile factories. The young Kazakh iron and steel industry in the Soviet Union will greatly expand within five years, and the steel factories will be completed by 1948 to produce high-quality metals such as steel and iron. Kazakhstan has 24 iron and steel bases, and the new five-year plan stipulates that the funds allocated to the Kazakh steel industry will be four times greater than the investment from 1936 to 1940. The smelting workers of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant have successfully completed their plan to increase smelting efficiency by 95%, and guaranteed to complete the plan of smelting 10,000 tons of steel ahead of schedule. The smelting volume of Magnitogorsk has increased by 96%, and smelting workers in other factories in the Soviet Union have also achieved new successes. A new industrial zone is rising on the Rostov plain in Georgia, with an annual output of 430,000 tons of iron, 500,000 tons of steel, and 380,000 tons of rolled metal.

　　In terms of coal and oil production, the western coal industry has completed the first half-year coal production plan ahead of schedule, an increase of 27% compared with the first half of last year. The Donbass Basin has also exceeded the completion of the half-year recovery plan. The southern and western petroleum industries have also completed the first half-year plan one month ahead of schedule.

　　In terms of electricity production, the world's largest Kirov Power Plant in Leningrad, powered by a new volute generator with 100,000 kilowatts of electricity rotating 3,000 times per minute, has completed the first half-year production plan. Another generator of the same type will be completed this year, and the construction of a 90,000 kilovolt-ampere hydroelectric generator will begin for the Dnepro Power Station.

　　In terms of railway construction, the Republic of Georgia will build 300 kilometers of new railways. By 1950, three-quarters of the country's railways will be electrified. Moscow will build a fourth subway line. The current Moscow subway network is 41 kilometers long and has 25 stations.

　　In terms of railway transportation, the overall transportation plan for the first half of the year was completed on June 28. During this period, coal transportation increased by 21% compared with last year, non-ferrous metals by 17%, timber by 31%, mineral sand by 11%, cotton by 47%, and building materials more than doubled. The victory in transportation will undoubtedly help increase the country's industrial production.

　　苏联重工业巨大发展提前完成上半年生产
    【新华社延安七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联重工业生产正以巨大速度发展中。在钢铁生产方面，欧洲最大卷铁厂“亚速夫斯尔”工厂已重新开工，至本年底即将超过战前产量。至一九四八年，该厂年产钢片及卷钢将有九百九十万吨，足够供给五个巨大牵引用自动车工厂一年需要。苏联年轻的哈萨克冶铁业，将于五年内大加扩张，一九四八年钢铁工厂将全部完成生产钢与铁等高金属。哈萨克有二十四个铁与钢基地，新五年计划规定拨给哈萨克冶铁时的基金，较一九三六年至四○年投资大四倍。马基斯瓦钢铁厂镕炼工人，已胜利完成他们提高镕量效率达百分之九十五，并保证提前完成镕炼一万吨铣铁的计划。马格尼哥尔斯克的鎔量提高百分之九十六，苏联其他各工厂鎔工们，也获得新的成就。在乔治亚罗斯托夫平原上，正兴起新的工业区，那里年产铁四十三万吨，钢五十万吨，卷金属三十八万吨。
    在煤炭石油生产方面，西部煤炭业都已先期完成上半年产煤计划，比去年上半年增长百分之二十七。顿巴斯盆地亦已超过完成半年恢复计划。南部与西部石油工业亦已提前一个月完成了头半年计划。
    在电力生产方面，世界最大的列城基洛夫电力厂，由十万基罗瓦特电力之新蜗形发电机，每分钟旋转三千次，因而完成了头半年的生产计划。今年内，将完成另一同样类型的发电机，并将开始建立九万基罗瓦特安培之水力发电机，以备德涅泊电力站之用。
    在建立铁路方面，乔治亚共和国将建立新铁道计三百公里。至一九五○年，全国铁路的四分之三将电气化。莫斯科将建立第四条地下铁路。现在莫斯科地道网有四十一公里，有二十五个车站。
    在铁路运输业方面，在六月二十八日完成了上半年的运输总计划。在此期间，煤的运输比去年增加百分之二十一，非铁金属百分之十七，木材百分之三十一，矿沙百分之十一，棉花百分之四十七，而建筑材料增加一倍以上。运输方面的胜利，无疑将帮助全国工业生产的增涨。
