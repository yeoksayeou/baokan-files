　　Military Region Headquarters Issues Order: All Winter Uniforms Must Be Made of Homespun Cloth
　　[Our Newspaper] To promote domestic goods and develop the rural textile industry in the liberated areas, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Headquarters has issued an order stipulating that all winter uniforms for the troops this year must be made of homespun cloth. The leaders of the military region hope that all commanders and fighters will recognize the significant importance of this order and implement it conscientiously.
　　[Our Newspaper Changzhi News] All agencies in the Taihang area unanimously support the Taihang District Party Committee's call for "practicing thrift and building the liberated areas." The Taihang Administrative Office has decided that, in principle, wheat will account for one-quarter of the public grain allocated in the future, with millet making up the rest. The Taihang Xinhua Daily and the Taihang Branch of the Xinhua News Agency convened an office meeting and decided to practice thrift and reduce expenses as much as possible. Cadres of all agencies have successively revised their personal production plans, increased their personal income, and saved public expenses.
