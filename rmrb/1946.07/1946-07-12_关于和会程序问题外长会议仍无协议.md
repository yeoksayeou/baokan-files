　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th: Paris dispatch: According to Reuters, from authoritative sources, the issue of which countries to invite to the peace conference has been agreed upon at the Foreign Ministers' conference on the 8th. The agreement represents a compromise between the Soviet position and the positions of the United States, Britain, and France. Invitations to the peace conference will be issued in the name of the Paris Conference. China is not included among the invited countries. The morning session on the 8th was presided over by Bidault. There is still no agreement on the issue of whether procedural rules should be formulated before issuing invitations. The British, American, and French foreign ministers are willing to issue invitations immediately, while Molotov insists on his original intention. United Press reported that Bidault believes that the difficult issue of procedure, whether the foreign ministers should establish strict rules for the conference, has a hopeful solution. Bidault and Bevin may compromise to the extent that the four powers only suggest to the conference how it should work.

　　关于和会程序问题外长会议仍无协议
    【新华社延安九日电】巴黎讯：据路透社自权威方面获悉：和会邀请国问题，在外长会议八日会议上已获协议，该协议表示苏方主张与美英法主张之间的妥协。和会请柬将以巴黎会议名义发出，中国不包括在邀请国之内。八日上午的会议由贝纳斯主持。关于发出请柬之前，是否应先制定程序规则问题，仍无协议。英美法外长愿意立即发出请柬，莫洛托夫则坚持原意。合众社记者报导：比道尔认为是否各外长应为和会立下严格规则，程序的困难问题，有希望解决。贝纳斯与贝文或可妥协至此种程度，即四强只向和会建议应如何工作。
