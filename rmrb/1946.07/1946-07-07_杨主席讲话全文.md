Fellow villagers! Comrades!

　　Today, we are holding another anti-civil war rally. We are deeply saddened to hold such a rally. After defeating Japan, we all hoped for peace. The armies, people, and government of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region were all trying to achieve peace. The Chinese Communist Party was also making every effort to achieve peace. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries want to fight a civil war again, which makes us, the common people, want to shed tears.

　　Who wants the civil war? Everyone should understand this point well. Is it the Communist Party? Is it the common people? Neither! It is the Kuomintang reactionaries, it is Chiang Kai-shek. Why do they want to fight a civil war? It is because the reactionaries within the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek want one-party dictatorship, not allowing the people to be masters of their own house. From the issuance of the ceasefire order to now, they have been actively attacking the liberated areas every single day. The good methods decided upon at the Political Consultative Conference were all for peace and democracy. We implemented them, but they didn't, and instead opposed them even more frantically. Our region's army has already demobilized more than 70,000 in the first phase, and other liberated areas are also demobilizing. But Chiang Kai-shek is conscripting soldiers, and recently even wants to form high school graduates into ten divisions to be his cannon fodder. Chiang Kai-shek's idea is to maintain one-party dictatorship and not implement democracy, so we demand democracy but he refuses, and even wants to fight us. We must resolutely demand democracy and resolutely oppose one-party dictatorship!

　　Comrades! Compatriots! The large-scale civil war launched by the Kuomintang has already started again in the south. Chiang Kai-shek is using twenty-five divisions to surround the Central Plains Military Region, attempting to annihilate our troops in that area and destroy that liberated area. The large-scale encirclement has already begun. We must rise up to oppose the Kuomintang's expansion of the civil war, stop the civil war, and demand peace.

　　The Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek's power alone is not enough for them to dare to fight a civil war. Behind him, the United States is helping him. Everyone sees that the Kuomintang army, from the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the guns and bullets they use in battle, to the planes, cars, ships, and warships that transport them to the front lines of the civil war, none of it is not from the United States. It is the American imperialist elements who are expanding the Chinese civil war.

　　Why do the American imperialist elements want to help the Kuomintang fight a civil war? The United States hopes to turn China into its colony so that it can monopolize the market and do business. Therefore, it tries every possible way to help the Kuomintang, and also to carry out its opposition to the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department recently submitted a bill to the U.S. Congress to continue military aid to Chiang Kai-shek. Japan has already been defeated, why is this aid still needed? Their intention is self-evident. Recently, the U.S. Secretary of State stated: "A military mission will be sent to China, just like those sent to Latin America." Latin America is considered a colony by American imperialism. They want to turn China into the second Philippines, which means that the United States sees today's China as its colony as well. Helping the Kuomintang fight a civil war, fighting the Chinese people who demand independence, freedom, peace, and democracy, is for this purpose. So today, everyone must rise up to oppose the American imperialist elements.

　　We have suffered from imperialist oppression for over a hundred years. Our ancestors shed a lot of blood. In the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, we also shed a lot of blood to drive out Japanese imperialism. But now comes an American imperialism that is actively invading and interfering in China's internal affairs. Dumping goods, oppressing many of our national capitalists, causing factories to close down. In the fatherland's land, sea, and air, everywhere are American planes, ships, and troops. Japan has already surrendered, we are an independent country, this is a violation of our independent sovereignty. Why does it still do this, and how can it do this? There is no other reason, it is because the United States sees us as a colony, and Chiang Kai-shek colluded and sold us to it, so it dares to do this! Without internal traitors, invaders cannot easily enter. In the past, the Song Dynasty had the traitors Qin Hui and Zhang Bangchang, and a traitorous emperor called Liu Yu, who harmed the loyal minister Yue Fei, and called the invaders "child emperor." Today's Kuomintang reactionaries are Qin Hui and Zhang Bangchang, Chiang Kai-shek is the child emperor Liu Yu, the Chinese people swear to oppose them to the death. Everyone shout together: "Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's shameless traitorous behavior!" "Oppose the child emperor!"

　　The child emperor is serving the American imperialist elements, there are ironclad facts. Other instances of forfeiting sovereignty aside, let me just cite one thing: recently, the Kuomintang government made a decision to hand over the "final decision-making power over Chinese affairs to the United States." They didn't even dare to ask the Communist Party representatives for agreement, and were resolutely opposed by General Zhou Enlai.

　　Selling out China's inland river navigation rights, allowing the American imperialist elements' land, sea, and air forces to arbitrarily come and go in China's territorial waters and airspace, and station troops within Chinese territory, is this not a "child emperor"? We resolutely oppose this traitorous act. The Chinese people can solve their own country's problems, there is no need for foreigners to "decide"!

　　The Kuomintang's large-scale offensive has already begun in the Central Plains Liberated Area. How do we oppose it? First, we must shout! The people must shout their demands, shout their voices against the civil war and for peace! Shouting is power. In Shanghai, 50,000 people are opposing and shouting. In Hangzhou, 10,000 people are opposing and shouting. In other places, millions of people are opposing and shouting. We must support them. They are also supporting us. This time, representatives of Shanghai citizens went to Nanjing to demand that Chiang Kai-shek stop the civil war, and to demand that Marshall not help the Kuomintang fight a civil war. Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents actually injured the seventy-plus-year-old professor Ma Xulun at Nanjing Xiaguan Railway Station, and four others were also injured along with him. We must shout loudly to support them and comfort them. Shout loudly against civil war! Demand peace, demand democracy! Oppose fascist dictatorship! Demand national independence and freedom, oppose the child emperor! Oppose the Qin Hui government! Oppose American imperialist interference in China's internal affairs! Oppose American troops stationed in China! Withdraw American troops from China! Oppose sending a military mission to China!

　　But shouting alone is not enough, we must also prepare actual strength to repel the Kuomintang's offensive. If they want to attack, we must resolutely defend ourselves and protect the liberated areas. As in the past, give the fascist reactionaries a severe blow. The more painful we hit them, the sooner peace will arrive, everyone must believe this.

　　Can we win the battle? When the Ping-Han Campaign began last year, many people were afraid that we would not be able to hold our ground, but we won. Everyone gained confidence. We fought Japan for eight years, and grew stronger and stronger as we fought, and finally defeated them. Chiang Kai-shek, no matter what, cannot compare to Japan. We have the strength to defeat Japan, so we have the strength to repel Chiang Kai-shek's offensive! Last year's Ping-Han Campaign was a powerful proof. Our armed comrades have received good training, and have capable commanders. We have been winning battles for nine years. We must shout loudly: Support our army! Believe that our army will definitely win!

　　The strength of each liberated area is even stronger. Look at how heroic and powerful the newly established Northeast Liberated Area and the Northeast Allied Army are. We must also believe in the great strength of the people themselves. In the War of Resistance Against Japan, we fought the enemy. In the Ping-Han self-defense war, we fought the reactionaries. Tens of thousands of our people went to the front lines, carrying stretchers, transporting supplies, and transporting ammunition. Militias and self-defense forces gathered at the front lines like mountains. This power is great. With this great power combined with the army, we can win the battle. The villagers in the newly liberated areas must learn from the methods of the villagers in the old liberated areas in dealing with Japan – empty houses and clear fields, so that the attackers have no food to eat, no water to drink, and the militia fights guerrilla warfare, making the attackers unable to sleep peacefully and unable to walk smoothly. In this way, we will quickly drive out the attackers.

　　We must also see that our struggle is not isolated. Now, the people of the whole country are standing with us, opposing the civil war, demanding peace and democracy. If a big war breaks out, they will all help us. Some people are worried that the United States is helping the Kuomintang, and they have many tanks, planes, and cannons, what should we do? Everyone must know that without good roads, tanks cannot climb. Without gasoline, they cannot even move. If we destroy the roads and they lack gasoline, they will be forced down. Tanks will walk on foot like us, but they cannot outwalk us. Japan also had planes, cannons, and tanks, and was very strong and fierce, but what was the result? We grew stronger and stronger as we fought, and finally we defeated them. If American soldiers come to fight us together with the Kuomintang army, they will be opposed by the American people. Now, the American imperialist elements are helping Chiang Kai-shek massacre the Chinese people, which has aroused the opposition of the American people. They are demanding the withdrawal of their troops and not to attack the liberated areas. Many American troops are also unwilling to help the Kuomintang fight a civil war. With the unanimous opposition of the American people, the American army, and the Chinese people, the American army will have no choice but to withdraw from China. The American people are standing with us, helping us oppose American imperialism.

　　Moreover, the people of all countries around the world are demanding peace and democracy. They sympathize with the Chinese people's demand for peace and democracy. Especially the Soviet Union, the pillar of world peace, firmly upholds world peace. It will give us great assistance in international diplomacy. According to the Moscow Conference decision, the Soviet army withdrew from China long ago. The United States still has not withdrawn, and even wants to move their families here. The Soviet Union will speak out. All peace-loving and democratic people in the world will help us.

　　The most important thing is our own strength. We must be on alert and prepare well. We won the Ping-Han Campaign. If they come again, and we are better prepared, we will definitely win again, and it will be even more enthusiastic and better than last year!

　　Looking at the Kuomintang again, it is internally inconsistent, and many people oppose the civil war. Many people in its army also oppose the civil war. Haven't there been continuous uprisings recently? Maybe there will be even more in the future.

　　Everyone be on alert, determined to prepare to strike the fascist offensive! The current preparatory work: First, be prepared for air raids. Second, prevent spies, and launch the anti-spy and grievance-telling movement. Third, workers must do a good job in factory production, farmers must cultivate the land well and produce more grain, and merchants must do a good job in business and try their best to supply daily necessities. Fourth, everyone must organize the militia and self-defense forces well. All work must be intensified. As long as the work is done well, victory will come even greater.

　　If the Kuomintang reactionaries want to attack, we will resolutely defend ourselves, protect our homes, give them a painful and severe blow, and quickly drive them back. Peace will come quickly, this is without doubt.

　　杨主席讲话全文老乡们！同志们！
    今天，我们又来开反内战大会，开这样的大会我们是痛心的。在打败了日本以后，我们都希望和平，晋冀鲁豫边区的军队，老百姓，政府都在想法要和平，中国共产党也是竭力想法要和平；可是，国民党反动派却又要打内战，我们老百姓听到这里是要掉泪的。
    谁要内战？大家应该很好理会这点，是共产党吗？是老百姓吗？都不是！是国民党反动派，是蒋介石。他们为什么想打内战呢？就是国民党内反动派和蒋介石想一党专政，不让老百姓当家，从颁布停战命令到现在没有一天不在积极进攻解放区，政治协商会议上决定的那些好办法都是为了和平民主，我们实行了他不实行，反而更疯狂的反对。本区军队第一期复员的已有七万多，其他解放区也在复员，可是蒋介石却在征兵，最近还想把高中毕业生编成十个师来为他当炮灰，蒋介石的主意就是要维持一党专政，不实行民主，所以我们要求民主他不给，还要打我们。我们要坚决要求民主，坚决反对一党专政！
    同志们！同胞们！国民党发动的大内战已经又在南面打起来了，蒋介石用二十五个师把中原军区包围起来，企图歼灭该地我军，摧毁这块解放区，大围攻已经开始了，我们要起来反对国民党扩大内战，制止内战，要求和平。
    只是国民党蒋介石的力量是不敢打内战的，在他后面有美国帮助他，大家看，国民党军队内吃的到穿的、打仗用的枪炮子弹、运送他们到内战前线的飞机、汽车、轮船、军舰，没有一样不是美国的。是美帝国主义分子扩大了中国内战。
    美国帝国主义分子为什么要帮助国民党打内战呢？美国希望把中国变成他的殖民地后好独占市场做买卖。于是想尽办法帮助国民党，另外也为了他自己好进行反对苏联。美国国务院最近向美国国会提了个继续以军事援助蒋介石的法案。日本已经打败了，为什么还要这种援助，其用心是什么？不问可知。最近美国国务卿说明：“要向中国派出军事使团，象派到拉丁美洲的一样”，拉丁美洲是美帝国主义所认为的殖民地，要把中国变成菲律宾第二，这就是说美国把今天的中国也看成了她的殖民地了。帮助国民党打内战，打要求独立自由与和平民主的中国老百姓，就是为了这个目的。所以今天大家要起来反对美帝国主义分子。
    我们受帝国主义压迫已一百多年了，我们祖先流了很多血。八年抗战，我们也流了很多血才把日本帝国主义打出去，可是现在又来了一个美帝国主义积极侵略，干涉中国内政，货物倾销，压迫我们的许多民族资本家的工厂关了门。在祖国的陆海与空中，到处是美国飞机、轮船和军队，日本已经投降了，我们是独立国家，这是侵犯我独立主权。它为什么还这样干，又何以能这样干呢？没有别的，就是美国把我们看作殖民地，是蒋介石勾结出卖给它，它才敢这样作的！没有内奸卖国贼，侵略者是不容易进来的。从前宋朝出了卖国贼秦桧、张邦昌，有个卖国皇帝叫刘豫，害死忠臣岳飞，对侵略者称“儿皇帝”，今天的国民党反动派就是秦桧、张邦昌，蒋介石就是儿皇帝刘豫，中国老百姓誓死反对。大家一齐高呼：“反对蒋介石的无耻卖国行为”！“反对儿皇帝”！
    儿皇帝是给美帝国主义分子当的、有铁一般的事实。其他断送主权不必说，仅举一件事：最近国民党政府作了个决定，把处理中国事情的“最后决定权交给美国”无颜向共产党代表要求同意，遭到周恩来将军的坚决反对。
    把中国的内河航行权出卖，让美国帝国主义分子的海陆空军，任意在中国的领海领空来往在中国境内驻扎这不是“儿皇帝”是什么？！我们坚决反对这种卖国勾当，中国老百姓能够解决自己国家的事情，无须乎外国人来“决定”！
    国民党大进攻已在中原解放区开始了，我们如何反对呢？首先我们要喊！老百姓们要把自己的要求，把反内战要和平的声音高高地喊！喊就是力量。上海有五万人反、在喊。杭州有一万人在反，在喊。其他各地千千万万的人都在反，在喊，我们要援应他们。他们也在援应我们。这次上海市民代表到南京，向蒋介石要求停止内战，向马歇尔要求美国不要帮助国民党打内战。蒋介石的特务竟在南京下关车站把七十多岁的老教授马教伦打伤了，还有其他四位一同被打成伤。我们要高高喊起来，声援他们，慰问他们。高喊反对内战！要求和平要求民主！反对法西斯独裁！要求民族独立自由，反对儿皇帝！反对秦桧政府！反对美帝国主义干涉中国内政！反对美帝国在中国驻军！把美国军队撤出中国去！反对派军事使团来华！
    但是光喊不行，还要准备实际力量，打退国民党的进攻。如果它要打进来，我们要坚决自卫保卫解放区。如过去一样，给法西斯反动派以严重的打击。把他打得越痛，和平就越能早到来，这一点大家要相信。
    我们能不能打胜仗呢？去年平汉战役开始，有很多人怕我们站不住，结果打胜了，大家都有了信心。我们和日本打了八年，越打越大，结果把她打败了，蒋介石无论如何顶不上日本，我们有力量打败日本，就有力量打退蒋介石的进攻！去年平汉战役是有力的证明。我们的武装同志都有了很好的锻炼，有高明指挥者，九年以来一直打胜仗，我们要高呼：拥护我们的军队！相信我们的军队一定能打胜仗！
    各个解放区的力量是更坚强了，你看后起的东北解放区与东北联军是多么英勇而有力量，我们还要相信老百姓自己的伟大力量，在抗战中打敌人，在平汉自卫战争中打反动派，我们成千成万的老百姓上前线，抬担架、运给养、运弹药。民兵、自卫队象山一样集结在前线，这个力量是伟大的，有了这个伟大力量与军队结合在一起，才能打胜仗。新解放区的老乡们要学习老解放区老乡们对付日本的办法——空室清野，叫进攻者没饭吃，没水喝，民兵打麻雀战，使进攻者睡也睡不安稳，走路也走不顺利，这样一来，很快就会把进攻者打出去。
    还要看，我们的斗争不是孤立的，现在全国人民都和我们站在一起，反对内战，要求和平民主，如果大打起来，他们都会帮助我们。有人耽心多了个美国帮助国民党，坦克、飞机、大炮很多，怎么办？大家要知道，如果没有好路，坦克是爬不动的，没有汽油更爬不起来，我们把路破了，他缺乏汽油，会叫它下了，坦克和我们一样用脚走路，他们是走不过我们的。日本也有飞机、大炮、坦克，并且很强很凶，结果怎样呢？我们曾经越打越大，最后我们把他打败了，美国士兵要和国民党军队一道来打我们，会遭到美国人民的反对。现在美国帝国主义分子，帮助蒋介石屠杀中国人民，已引起美国人民的反对了，要求撤回他们的兵，不打解放区，美国军队也多不愿帮助国民党打内战。在美国人民美国军队和中国人民一致反对之下，美国军队将不能不撤出中国去，美国人民正在和我们在一起，帮助我们反对美帝国主义。
    还有全世界各国人民，都在要求和平、民主。对中国人民之要求和平、民主，他们是同情的，特别是世界和平支柱的苏联，坚决维护世界和平。在国际外交上是会给我们以很大援助的。根据莫斯科会议决定，苏联军队早已撤离中国，美国至今还不撤退，还想把家眷搬来，苏联是要说话的。全世界爱好和平、民主的人民都会帮助我们。
    最要紧的还是我们自己的力量，要紧张起来，好好准备。平汉战役我们胜利了。今后再来，如准备得更好，我们一定还要胜利，而且将比去年打得更热烈更好！
    再看看国民党，内部不一致，有很多反对打内战的，它的军队中也有很多反对打内战的，最近不是陆续不断的在起义吗？说不定将来还会更多。
    大家紧张起来，决心准备打击法西斯的进攻！当前的准备工作：一、要防空。二、防止奸细，把反奸诉苦运动开展起来。三、工人要搞好工厂的生产，农民要好好种地，多打粮食，商人要把买卖做好尽力供给日用品。四、大家要把民兵自卫队组织好。一切工作都要紧张起来。只要工作作好，胜利也就会来得更大。
    如果国民党反动派要来进攻，我们坚决自卫，保卫家乡，要痛痛快快打它一下，给他以严重打击，把他很快打回去，和平也就会很快的到来，这是无疑问的。
