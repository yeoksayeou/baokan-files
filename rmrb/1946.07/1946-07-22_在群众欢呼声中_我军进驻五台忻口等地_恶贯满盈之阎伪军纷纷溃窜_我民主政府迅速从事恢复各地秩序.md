　　[This Newspaper Reports] Under the victorious might of our anti-rebellion self-defense war, the Yan's puppet troops in the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway fled in disarray. On the 14th and 15th, amidst the cheers of the masses, our army marched into key towns in northeastern Shanxi, including Wutai, Yuanping, Xinkou, Hebian, and Dongye. Wutai City is a world-renowned Buddhist site, located at the foot of Mount Wutai, and is the birthplace of our Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei liberated area. General Nie Rongzhen's headquarters were stationed here for a long time. Xinkou and Yuanping were both famous battlefields where our Eighth Route Army fought against the Japanese invaders in the early stages of the War of Resistance. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they were completely surrounded by our army and people. Xinkou was even liberated by us once. After the Japanese surrender, the local puppet troops were incorporated by Yan Xishan into the 19th Army's Provisional 37th Division under Lei Yangtang and the Provisional 40th Division under Wang Qianyuan, whose trampling and plundering of the people was even worse than before. After the ceasefire order, they constantly attacked and nibbled away at our liberated areas. In Wutai County alone, more than twenty new strongholds were built, including Suzipo, Baijiazhuang, and Tianjiagang. By the end of May, more than 1,500 county and district cadres and civilians had been killed or arrested. The people were extremely angry and demanded that our army go to rescue them. After our army liberated the city of Guoxian, it immediately took advantage of the victory to advance towards Yuanpingzhen. The defending troops hastily retreated to Xinkou on the evening of the 14th, and on the evening of the 15th, they joined the puppet troops in Xinkou and fled to Xinxian County. Our army immediately marched into both places one after the other. At the same time, the Yan's puppet troops in Wutai also completely withdrew from their outer strongholds back to the city on the 13th. On the afternoon of the 14th, the defending troops of Wutai City, Dongye, Hebian Village, and other places all fled to Dingxiang City. The entire territory of Wutai was liberated one after another. While our local troops were pursuing them, two companies of Yan's puppet troops laid down their arms. Our democratic government is now rapidly engaged in restoring order in various locations.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 17th. The Yan's army in Xixian, Fenxi, and Lingshi are invading the fourth district of Fenxi and the fifth district of Xixian in the liberated area from three directions. On the 5th of this month, more than 300 members of the Yan's army's "Love the Homeland Corps" from Lingshi invaded Wangbao and Majiazhai (15 miles northwest of Fenxi City). The Yan's army from Fenxi attacked our Laofeng (northwest of Fenxi) from Maojiashangzhuang. More than 500 soldiers from the 45th Division of the Yan's army in Xixian attacked our Zhongcun and Beicun (northwest of Fenxi City) on the same day, and there was a tendency to attack @ Xiangzhen, an important town on the Fen (Xi) Xi (Xian) road.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 17th. The Yan's puppet troops in central Shanxi, under the personal command of Zhao Chengshui, are cooperating with the Chiang's army invading southern Shanxi to attack our Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, and other places. On the 13th, more than 1,000 Yan's puppet troops attacked from Yitang and Liangdu towns north of Jiexiu in two routes, and occupied Shijiashan, Majiashan, Liushu, and other places northeast of Lingshi. On the 13th, they once again captured Jingshengzhen and continued to attack our Jingjiezhen. After being counterattacked by our army, they retreated to Jingsheng and are now rushing to build bunkers to prepare for another attack. On the 11th, more than 1,000 soldiers from the 69th Division of the Yan's army attacked Nanbao east of Huo (County), invading Shangwang, Xiawang, Daoshibi, and other villages.
