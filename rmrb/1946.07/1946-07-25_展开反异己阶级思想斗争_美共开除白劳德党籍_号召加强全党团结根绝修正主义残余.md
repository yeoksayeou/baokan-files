　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: New York dispatch: The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States began its regular meeting in New York on February 12. On the afternoon of the 13th, it discussed the item on the agenda, "Expulsion of Browder." After hearing the report by Thomson on behalf of the National Bureau regarding the proposal to expel Browder and the discussion thereof, the 54 members of the National Committee unanimously passed the following resolution to expel Browder from the party on the 13th:

　　1. The National Committee has considered and agreed to the National Bureau's proposal, and the demands of members of our organizations at all levels, that Browder, who has shamefully violated party discipline and decisions, actively opposed our party's political line, and led factional activities, betrayed the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and fled to the class enemies—the US monopoly capital—should be expelled from the party.

　　2. The National Committee solemnly rejects the document submitted by Browder today, in which Browder appealed to the National Committee, disagreeing with his expulsion from the party. Browder's appeal itself confirms the correctness of the National Bureau's condemnation of him. Moreover, Browder's appeal is nothing more than an anti-Marxist fighting program put forward by a social-imperialist. The purpose of this social-imperialist is to launch an anti-communist and anti-Marxist political-ideological war. Therefore, the National Committee expels Browder from the Communist Party.

　　3. The struggle against Browder and Browderism has now entered a new stage. The struggle against Browder is no longer a struggle against a trend within the Communist movement and the workers' movement; it is now a struggle against a deserter from communism, against the ideology and influence of alien classes.

　　The whole party must be vigilant against factional activities. Browder is trying to organize such activities by distributing "Letters to All Comrades" and "Joint Guidance for Distribution."

　　The Party must be vigilant in maintaining and strengthening Party unity, the Party must eradicate all remnants of revisionism, and that decaying liberal attitude of compromisers toward Browder and Browderism, the Party must conduct an irreconcilable political-ideological struggle against the Browderism of hostile class ideology.

　　In this way, our Party can and will strengthen itself ideologically, politically, and organizationally, rapidly arming the Party into a mass party, and more effectively playing a vanguard role in today's and future great economic and political struggles.

　　展开反异己阶级思想斗争
    美共开除白劳德党籍
    号召加强全党团结根绝修正主义残余
    【新华社延安二十一电】纽约讯：美国共产党全国委员会于二月十二日在纽约开始举行例会，在十三日下午，讨论了议事日程上“开除白劳德”的问题。该会在听取了汤姆逊代表全国局所作关于建议开除白劳德并加以讨论的报告后，全国委员会五十四个委员即于十三日一致通过下述开除白劳德出党的决议。
    一、全国委员会已考虑并同意全国局的建议，及我各级组织成员的要求，即白劳德可耻地违反党纪与决定，积极反对我党政治路线，与领导发展派别活动，背叛马列主义的原则，并逃向阶级敌人——美国垄断资本方面，应予开除出党。
    二、全国委员会郑重拒绝白劳德今日所提出的文件，白劳德在这一文件中，向全国委员会申诉不同意开除他的党籍，白劳德的申诉本身，证实全国局对他的谴责之正确。不宁惟是，白劳德的申诉不多不少是一个社会——帝国主义者所提出的反马克思主义的斗争纲领而已。而这个社会——帝国主义者的目的，在于掀起反共产党、反马克思主义的政治——思想战。因此，全国委员会遂开除白劳德出共产党。
    三、反白劳德与白劳德主义的斗争，现已进入新阶段，反白劳德的斗争已不再是一个反共产党主义及工人运动中的方向的斗争了，它现在是一个反对共产主义的逃兵，反对异己阶级的思想与影响的斗争了。
    全党必须警惕派别活动，白劳德正试图通过散发“致全党同志信”及“分配联合指南”方法，来组织这种派别活动。
    党必须警惕以保持并加强党的团结，党必须根绝一切修正主义的残余，及对于白劳德及白劳德主义那种妥协者的腐朽自由主义态度，党必须进行反对敌对阶级思想的白劳德主义之不调和的政治——思想斗争。
    在这种方式中，我们党能够并将在思想上、政治上与组织上加强自己，迅速地将党武装成一个群众的党，并更加有效地在今天及未来伟大经济与政治斗争中起着先锋的作用。
