(Delayed dispatch from this newspaper) Mr. P. GIHON, Industrial Rehabilitation Specialist of the UNRRA China Office, and Mr. J. BRAILSFORD, Mining Specialist of the UNRRA Hebei-Rehe-Pingjin District (both British nationals), arrived in Handan from Bian on the 24th and stayed at the Border Region Government Guest House. The purpose of their visit was to inspect the industrial and mining construction situation in the region and investigate the various equipment needed for industrial and mining, so as to rationally allocate UNRRA relief supplies. On the 25th, the two gentlemen visited Handan Electric Company, Flour Company, and Oil Pressing Factory. They inspected all the machinery in detail and put forward many suggestions for improvement. The two gentlemen greatly admired the hardworking spirit of the factory workers in overcoming difficulties. They stated: The Electric Company provides light to the people, the Flour Company provides food to the people, and the Oil Pressing Factory supplies the people with a large amount of fertilizer, which is necessary for the development of agriculture. These are all good things done by the democratic government for the people. The two gentlemen found that the factories were extremely short of equipment and immediately requested the government to draw up a list, and after returning to Bian and Shanghai, they would do their best to urge the speedy transfer of supplies. This reporter visited them at the Guest House on the 26th. The two gentlemen expressed their gratitude for the hospitality and help provided by the Liberated Area troops and government along the way from Kaifeng to Heze and from Heze to Handan. It is said that many foreign industrialists are very willing to go to the Liberated Areas to help develop industry, but they have encountered serious blockades in the past and do not understand the situation in the Liberated Areas. The Liberated Areas should try every means to let foreigners know the truth about their hard work and active construction. He said: "As long as you get enough equipment and technology, you will build better than you are now."

　　联总甘一安等莅邯视察我工矿业建设
    他们说：“你们如有足够的器材和技术，将会建设得比现在更好”。
    【本报讯】（迟到）联总驻华办事处工业整理专员甘一安（Ｐ·ＧＩＨＯＮ）暨联总冀热平津区矿务专员巴利辐（Ｊ·ＢＲＡＩＬＳＦＯＲＤ）两先生（均英籍），于二十四日由汴抵邯郸，下榻边府交际处。两氏此来任务，为视察本区工业及矿业建设情况，调查本区工矿业所需各种器材，以便合理分配联总救济物资。二十五日，两先生参观邯郸电灯公司、面粉公司及榨油厂。对于各厂所有机件，视察极为周详，并提出许多改进的意见。两氏对于各厂职工埋头苦干、克服困难的工作精神极为赞佩。他们表示：电灯公司给人民以光明，面粉公司给人民以食粮，榨油厂供给人民大量肥料，为发展农业所必需。这都是民主政府给人民办的好事情。两氏发现各厂器材极为困难，当即要求政府开列清单，俟返汴、沪后，竭力敦促尽速拨运。记者于二十六日趋赴交际处访晤，两氏对由开封至荷泽，荷泽至邯郸沿途解放区部队、政府的招待帮助极表感谢。据称：许多外籍工业家极愿赴解放区帮助发展工业，但是他们过去遭遇到严重的封锁，对解放区情况多不了解，解放区应该想尽一切办法，把自己埋头苦干、积极建设的真象让外人知道，他说：“只要你们得到足够的器材和技术，你们是会建设得比现在更好的。”
