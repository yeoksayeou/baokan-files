Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 7th: Comprehensive reports indicate that large-scale warfare has erupted between the Vietnamese Nationalist Party and the Democratic League. The fighting began on the 18th in Lang Son and Thai Binh, and by July 3rd had spread to Phu Tho, Vinh Yen, Viet Tri, and other areas. The war was triggered by the Nationalist Party's attempt to overthrow the Vietnamese government led by the Democratic League by force. This serious incident occurred the day after French forces launched a new offensive against Vietnamese patriots. It is reported that on the 17th, French troops advanced into the Vietnamese-controlled stations and buildings on the outskirts of Haiphong and Hanoi, causing localized warfare. Subsequently, French forces in South Vietnam launched a large-scale offensive against the Vietnamese patriotic forces in Central Vietnam, occupying the Pleiku Valley.

The Vietnamese people have launched a wave of opposition against the provocations and reactionary actions of the French army and the Kuomintang. On June 27th, Hanoi declared a general strike, with transportation at a standstill and the entire city resembling a ghost town. The Vietnamese people declared that they would not resume normal life until the French army ceased its offensive in Central Vietnam and its provocative actions in Hanoi and Haiphong. On the 2nd, the Vietnamese government issued a communique stating that due to the intense French artillery fire, the Vietnamese army withdrew from Pleiku city after implementing a scorched earth policy, but the advancing French forces were encountering fierce resistance from the Vietnamese army. In Lang Son, Thai Binh, Phu Tho, Vinh Yen, Vietnam, and other places, the Vietnamese people inflicted severe blows on the Kuomintang traitorous troops. In the aforementioned areas, the Democratic League's reinforcements, tight encirclement, destruction of transportation, and economic blockade have put the Vietnamese Nationalist Party rebels in an unfavorable position.

　　国民党图推翻独立政府
    越南爆发大内战
    【新华社延安七日电】综合报导：越南国民党与民主同盟间爆发了大规模战事。战事于十八日开始于谅山、太平两地，至七月三日已扩展到富寿、永安、越池及其他地区。战事起因由于国民党企图以武力推翻民盟领导的越南政府。此一严重事件，发生在法军对越南爱国分子实行新进攻的第二日。按法军于十七日在海防及河内边沿进占越方控制的车站及建筑，引起了局部的战争，其后南越境法军又向中境越南爱国军大举进攻，占领了中南境的布莱谷。
    越南人民对越南法军及国民党的挑衅反动已掀起反对的怒潮。六月二十七日，河内宣布总罢工罢市，交通停顿，全城俨如死城。越人宣布非至法军在中境的进攻及在河内、海防的挑衅行动停止，决不复原。越南政府于二日发表公报称：布莱谷市由于法军炮火的炽烈，越军于实行焦土政策后退出该城，但继续进攻的法军正遭遇越军猛烈的阻击。谅山、太平、富寿、永安、越南等地越南人民则予国民党军以严重的打击。上述等地，因民盟方面大兵增援紧密包围、并破坏交通、封锁经济，已使越南国民党叛卖者处于不利地位。
