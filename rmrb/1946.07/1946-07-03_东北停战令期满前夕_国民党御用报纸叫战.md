　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: On the eve of the expiration of the Northeast ceasefire order, the smell of gunpowder permeates the newspaper opinion controlled by the Kuomintang authorities. According to a dispatch from United Press Shanghai on the 29th: Rendel reported that the Kuomintang authorities plan to launch an offensive within fourteen hours of the termination of the ceasefire order to eliminate the Communist Party. Anti-Communist General He Yingqin arrived at the forward command post in Changchun today (according to the Kuomintang army's encirclement and suppression of the CCP troops in the Central Plains has already begun). A United Press dispatch also stated: The Shanghai Shen Bao, controlled by the government, said in an editorial: "If the current authorities cannot reach a stalemate, then prepare to fight the Communist Party." The newspaper editorial urged anti-communist actions, comparing the current situation to a patient suffering from a critical illness, saying that all Chinese people want the patient to recover, but no one should advise the doctor to only prescribe medicine and not perform surgery. The Kuomintang military newspaper, Peace Daily, condemned "the CCP for inciting an anti-American movement (referring to opposition to the armed intervention of Chinese internal affairs by American imperialist elements), attempting to make the Marshall mission fail and disrupt world peace." As early as February, General Marshall admitted that a small number of stubborn elements in China were selfish and disregarded the right to destroy the peaceful and prosperous life desired by the majority of the Chinese people. In May, he reiterated that the warmongers in China would plunge China back into the flames of full-scale war and cause unbearable disasters to the Chinese people. Obviously, the stubborn elements and warmongers referred to by Mr. Marshall can only be the Kuomintang reactionaries, who can be worthy of this title. American observers generally believe that the hawkish reactionary group within the Kuomintang is determined to eliminate the Communist Party.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: According to a United Press dispatch on the 29th: Just as Kuomintang troops are reportedly consolidating their positions to eliminate the CCP, Marshall is making a last-ditch effort today to extend China's ceasefire order.

　　东北停战令期满前夕
    国民党御用报纸叫战
    【新华社延安三十日电】东北停战令期满前夕，火药气味弥漫在国民党当局控制的报纸舆论中。据合众社上海二十九日电：伦德尔报导，国民党当局计划于停战令终止后十四小时内，发动攻势，消灭共产党。反共将军何应钦即于今日抵长春前进指挥部（按国民党军围歼中原中共部队的行动已开始）。合众社电讯又称：政府控制的上海申报社论说：“如目前之当局相持不下，则准备对共产党作战。”该报社论敦促采取反共行动，并以一患病极重的病人比喻目前形势，谓所有中国人都要求病人复原，但谁也不应劝医生只开药方而不动手术。国民党军事机关报——和平日报谴责“中共煽动反美运动（按即指反对美帝国主义分子武装干涉中国内政），试图使马歇尔使命失败，并扰乱世界和平。”按早在二月间，马歇尔将军就曾承认中国的少数顽固分子自私自利，即摧毁中国大多数人民所渴望的和平与繁荣生活的权利，亦所不顾。在五月间他又曾重复指出：中国的好战分子将把中国重陷于全面的战争火焰，并使中国人民遭受不堪的灾难。显明的，这里马氏所指的顽固分子及好战分子，事实上证明除国民党反动派能荣膺这个称号外，还能何所指呢？美方观察家咸信国民党内好战的反动集团，已决心要消灭共产党。
    【新华社延安三十日电】据合众社二十九日电：正当据报国民党军队方面巩固阵地以消灭中共之际，马歇尔今日正尽最后一刻的努力，以展延中国之停战令。
