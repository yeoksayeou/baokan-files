The puppet troops in Liaocheng, under the support of the Kuomintang Shandong military and political authorities, not only did not abandon their hostile attitude towards us after we seized a large number of illegal aid materials from He Siyuan on the evening of May 3rd, and established an agreement to relieve the refugees in the city. They also frequently fired shots at our garrison troops at the four gates. Moreover, they resolutely refused the suggestion of letting refugees out of the city for relief, and intensified their exploitation of the people in the city, creating a serious famine of hunger, suicide, and death for 30,000 residents, plunging the county town of Liaocheng into a gloomy and terrifying abyss. According to citizens and merchants who recently sneaked out of the city, the current situation in the city is as follows: The city has been ravaged by traitors beyond recognition. The tables, chairs, benches, doors, windows, and beams in the homes of ordinary people have all been burned. Various utensils have also been snatched away by the traitor soldiers. Not to mention food such as oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and grain, which have long gone to the barracks and have already been turned into feces by the traitors' stomachs. The citizens, emaciated from hunger, beg along the streets, and the sounds of hunger and starvation fill every corner with miserable cries. Even some wealthy families cannot buy food and suffer from endless hunger. As the weather gets hotter, epidemics spread. The number of people dying from illness, starvation, forced hanging, jumping into wells… and other suicides is increasing day by day. Recently, more than 300 people have died from starvation and suicide alone. Corpses can be seen everywhere on the streets and roads every day. Groups of begging citizens call out along the streets (even they themselves have no confidence that they can get any food), but there is no response. If there is any, it is the desperate cries of another group of beggars. ………………… The traitor soldiers give out two steamed buns a day. A soldier took his steamed buns home, and his wife said, "If I eat them, how will you stand guard?" As a result, she gave a piece to their child. When the soldier returned, his wife had already hanged herself. In this situation of hanging his wife and starving his son, he also hanged himself. Everyone understands how they died and why they died. This is all caused by the traitor Wang Jinxiang.
The people also understand that as long as the city gates are opened and entry and exit are allowed, tens of thousands of pounds of relief grain will immediately be brought into their stomachs.
The news of the Eighth Route Army providing relief three times at the city gates spread into the city. Citizens wanted to run out to seek a way to survive, and immediately gathered more than 700 people, kneeling before the traitor Wang Jinxiang, demanding that he let them out. But Wang Jinxiang angrily scolded, "You are really bastards. What if you go out and are shot to death by the Eighth Route Army machine guns? Anyone who proposes to leave the city will be charged with being an internal traitor!" The petitioning crowd remained kneeling, hoping to move this murderous demon with the human conscience of pity for death, but as a result, they were dispersed by a burst of rifle butts and wooden sticks. They had no choice but to wait for the coming of death with their broken and bleeding bodies.
The only people in Liaocheng who are not starving are the traitor officials such as Wang Jinxiang. He Siyuan has repeatedly used airlifts to aid them, dropping not only weapons and ammunition to expand the civil war, but also valuable foods such as rock sugar, canned goods, rice, and white flour. Moreover, Lu Yaoqian, a member of the Kuomintang Shandong Provincial Government, more considerately used more than 200,000 yuan of public funds to purchase and send opium, calling Wang Jinxiang to "enjoy" it (in case of boredom while defending the city), and to eliminate "worries," etc. (see the letter to Wang Jinxiang seized on May 3rd), allowing the traitors to enjoy themselves, regardless of the life and death of the people.
There is nothing in the world more instructive than hunger and death. The citizens of Liaocheng all understand extremely well that all the current disasters, hunger, and death are brought by the airplanes with the blue sky and white sun emblem and the people with the words "Central Army" on them. In the hearts of the citizens, these people are closely linked with the words "Japanese devils and traitors" and are difficult to distinguish. Now the citizens can only hold their bellies and hope that the Eighth Route Army will come to rescue them and break through this death city as soon as possible.

　　水深火热的死城
　  ——聊城三万居民呼唤救命！
    在国民党山东军政当局百般支援下的聊城伪军，自五月三日黄昏经我查获何思源大批非法援助物资，成立救济城内难民之协议后，不仅未放弃其对我敌对态度，且时常向我四关驻军发枪射击，而且坚决地拒绝了放难民出城以便进行救济的建议，并加紧对城内人民的压榨剥削，制造着三万居民的饥饿、自杀死亡的严重灾荒，使一座聊城县城，陷入了阴森的恐怖的深渊。据最近从城内偷跑出来的市民商人谈，该城近况如下：城里被汉奸糟踏的已不像样子。老百姓家中的桌椅、板凳、门窗、过木都已烧光了，各种用具也被汉奸兵抢去了，油盐酱醋粮食等食品，更不用提，早已跑到兵营去了，早由汉奸们的肠胃变为粪了。被饿的皮包骨头的市民群众，沿街求乞，啼饥呼饿的声音凄厉地充溢到每个角落，就是有些钱的人家，也买不到东西吃而无休止的饿着肚皮。随着天热时疫蔓延起来了，病死、饿死、被迫上吊跳井、……等自杀的数目日渐增加起来，单饿死与自杀者新近便有三百余人，在街头路旁每天随处都可看到死尸。求乞的市民成群地沿街叫化（连他们自己也没有信心，可以获得什么食物）一点反响都没有，要有也是另一群乞丐的绝望呼喊。…………………汉奸兵每天发两个馒头。一个兵把领的馒头拿回家去，他老婆说：“我吃了你怎么站岗呢？”结果给孩子吃了一块，待这个兵又回来时，他老婆已上吊死了，在此吊死老婆，饿坏儿子的情景下，他自己也上吊自杀。每个人都明白这是怎么死的，为什么死的，这全是汉奸王金祥一手造成的。
    人民同样明白只要开城门允许出入，数万斤救济粮会马上被带进肚皮。
    八路军在城关三次救济的消息传进城来，市民想跑出去求个活路，马上集合起七百余人，跪在王逆金祥的面前，要求把他们放出去，但王逆勃然大怒地骂道：“你们真混蛋，出去叫八路机关枪扫死怎么办呢？谁再提出城就以内奸论罪！”请愿的群众依然跪着不动，期望能以人类对死亡的惋惜的天良感动这个杀人的魔主，但结果被一阵枪托木棒驱散，他们只好带着残破血流的躯体静候着死亡的来临。
    聊城不挨饿的只有王逆金祥等汉奸官，何思源曾数度的以空运来接济他们，除抛下扩大内战的武器弹药外，还有冰糖、罐头、大米、白面等贵重食品，而国民党山东省政府委员芦耀潜更体贴地以公款二十余万，购送鸦片烟土，叫王逆金祥（以备守城苦闷）“受用”，和什么剔除“烦忧”等等，（见五月三日被查致王逆金祥函）让汉奸们享乐痛快，那管什么人民的死活。
    世上再没有比饥饿与死亡更能教训人的了，聊城的市民谁都极为明白，现在的一切灾难饥饿与死亡，都是那带着青天白日图样的飞机和带着“中央军”三个字的人带来的。这些人在市民的心里，和鬼子汉奸字样密切地连结在一起难于分辩。而今市民们只有抱紧肚皮期望着八路军早日来解救他们，击破这座死城。
