Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: Brief Biography of Tao Xingzhi: Tao Xingzhi, originally named Zhihang, was a native of She County (Huizhou), Anhui Province, and lived to the age of 54. He devoted his life to the cause of education for the masses. He was the creator of the theory of "living education" and successively founded Xiaozhuang Normal School, Yucai School, and Social University. He also dedicated his life to the Chinese independent and democratic movement, serving as a prominent leader of the China National Salvation Association, a standing committee member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, and the director of the Democratic Education Committee, as well as a standing director of the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Association. He studied in the United States in his early years, earning a master's degree in education from Columbia University. After returning to China, he served as the director of the Education Department of National Southeast University and the principal of Nanjing Anhui Public School. In 1924, he joined the Chinese National Association of the Mass Education Movement and founded the Xiaozhuang Normal School in Yanziji, Nanjing, advocating for "living education," which was soon shut down by the Kuomintang authorities. Subsequently, he founded the Living Education Society, publishing the "Living Education" magazine, and established the Industrial-Educational Corps in Shanghai, advocating the "little teacher" system and the unity of teaching, learning, and doing, as well as the principle of "knowing and immediately transmitting knowledge to others," as a method to popularize mass education. In 1935, he founded the National Crisis Education Society, publishing the "National Crisis Education Program," and was one of the initiators and leaders of the National Salvation Associations of all sectors of society. In 1936, he jointly published the famous "Several Basic Conditions and Minimum Requirements for Unity Against Aggression" with Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, and Zhang Naiqi. During the Seven Gentlemen Incident, Mr. Tao was lecturing in the United States and participating in the overseas Chinese anti-Japanese movement, and was wanted by the Kuomintang authorities. He returned to China in 1939 and was hired as a member of the first and second sessions of the National Political Council, but was dismissed from the third session onwards. During the Anti-Japanese War, he founded the Yucai School in Chongqing. In February of this year, he founded the Social University and served as its president. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Tao became one of the leaders of the Shanghai democratic movement. Recently, he strongly refuted the Kuomintang authorities' suppression of the peace and democracy movement, the creation of the Xiaguan Massacre, and the wholehearted pursuit of civil war under the encouragement of the US authorities. He passed away in Shanghai on July 25th of this year due to a cerebral hemorrhage.
