　　Chiang-Yan Troops Cause Major Disaster in Wuxi
    Second Administrative Office of Taihang Allocates Grain for Emergency Relief
    [Taihang Benbao News] The dozens of villages in the third, eighth, tenth, and eleventh districts of Wuxi (Xiang), Taihang District, with nearly 20,000 people, have suffered from the ravages of the enemy and puppets for the past eight years, and then suffered the crazy looting of Chiang-Yan troops. According to incomplete statistics from forty natural villages in the four districts from January 13 to April, the loss of grain alone was 5,116 shi, and the loss of livestock, houses, clothing, etc., totaled more than 19.8 million yuan. Villages along the border are almost completely deserted, and the scene is desolate, even with the tragic situation of "starving to death" and "not having the strength to bury the dead." The morale of the masses is extremely low, they are unable to produce, and spring plowing is almost at a standstill. In view of this, the Second Administrative Office decided to support production and self-defense in the disaster area, and allocated 500 shi of grain for emergency relief, and issued the following instructions for the work in the disaster area: (1) The distribution of relief should be focused, fast, and emphasize the combination of relief and organization of production to prevent the breeding of dependence. (2) Organize strong support throughout the county, and adjust labor, livestock power, agricultural tools, and seeds to solve the production difficulties of the victims. (3) Organize armed support, mobilize self-defense, organize militia organizations in the rear into rotation teams, combine labor and military affairs, protect production, and protect the summer harvest. (4) Combine self-defense production, seize the opportunity to mobilize the masses, oppose traitors and reduce rents, and consolidate the border areas. (5) Organize a unified leadership institution and establish a self-defense production committee for unified leadership.
