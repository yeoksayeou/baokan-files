　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 19th: According to a dispatch from Xi'an, published in the Democratic Daily on June 16th, the officers and soldiers of the Nationalist Army's 55th Division, stationed in Gongxian County, Henan Province, staged an uprising against the civil war on May 15th, led by Deputy Division Commander Kong Congzhou. It is reported that they are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Nationalist troops ordered to encircle and annihilate them in the border region of Henan and Shaanxi. This unit originally belonged to the old Northwest Army and was later incorporated by the Nationalist authorities and placed under the command of Zhang Yaoming of the 38th Army in the First War Zone, stationed in Luoning and other areas in western Henan. After the Japanese surrender, they were ordered to attack the Communist Party's areas in western Henan. However, the officers and soldiers of this unit firmly opposed this, but to no avail, and they were forced to move south this spring. The Nationalist authorities then used reorganization as an excuse to weaken them. Division Commander Kong Congzhou was also demoted to Deputy Division Commander. They secretly ordered the Nationalist direct-line troops near Zhengzhou to heavily surround them, attempting to forcibly disarm them, reorganize them again, and drive them to the front lines of the civil war. As the surrounding troops pressed closer, conflict erupted. The officers and soldiers of the division, filled with righteous indignation and unwilling to slaughter their own compatriots, staged an uprising against the civil war under the leadership of Deputy Division Commander Kong.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shuyang, 19th: Soldiers and lower-ranking officers of the Chiang Kai-shek troops in northern Jiangsu are disgusted with the civil war. The company commander of the 7th Company of the 11th Regiment of the 4th Reserve Division of the Nationalist 98th Army, stationed in Xinpu and Haizhou, committed suicide with his gun on the 3rd of this month after listening to the civil war mobilization speech by the army commander, Duan Linmao, and Xia Dingwen, the commissioner of the 8th District of Jiangsu Province under the KMT government. The number of soldiers deserting from the army is also increasing daily. The military law office of the 11th Regiment has captured more than 40 deserters in the past few days, some of whom have been brutally killed, but those who want to escape continue to do so.
