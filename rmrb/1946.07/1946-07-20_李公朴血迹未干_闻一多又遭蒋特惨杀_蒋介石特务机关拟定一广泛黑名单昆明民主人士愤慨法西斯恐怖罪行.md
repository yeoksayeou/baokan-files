　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 17th: According to reports: Mr. Wen Yiduo, a nationally renowned writer and professor at the Southwest Associated University, was brutally shot and killed by Kuomintang secret agents in Kunming a few days ago. This incident occurred only three days after the murder of Mr. Li Gongpu. Mr. Wen devoted his life to the cause of national salvation and progressive cultural endeavors, which incurred the jealousy of the Kuomintang fascists. At 5:30 PM on the 15th, Mr. Wen, accompanied by his son Wen Lihe, was walking north from the Democratic Weekly office at No. 14 Yongdao Street in Kunming when they were suddenly surrounded by several Chiang Kai-shek agents lying in wait there. The agents opened fire, the shots coming in rapid succession. Mr. Wen and his son were immediately wounded and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and losing consciousness. The assassins calmly fled the scene. Mr. Wen and his son were later taken to Yunnan University Hospital for treatment. Mr. Wen died en route to the hospital due to multiple gunshot wounds to the abdomen. His son, Wen Lihe, was also shot five times, once in the left chest, once in the right chest, and three times in the legs, one leg being severed. His life hangs in the balance. According to sources: The successive assassinations of Wen Yiduo and his son, and Li Gongpu, are the beginning of a large-scale terrorist operation by fascist bandits. Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organs have recently drafted a broad blacklist, including prominent progressive cultural figures nationwide, in an attempt to suppress the pervasive domestic peace and democracy movement. Democratic figures remaining in Kunming are extremely indignant at such fascist terrorist crimes!
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 17th: Wen Yiduo's brief biography: Wen Yiduo is currently 49 years old, from Hubei Province, graduated from Tsinghua University, studied at the Art Institute of Chicago in the United States, specializing in literature and Western painting, and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Chicago. After returning to China, he successively served as professor and dean of academic affairs at the National Beijing Art Specialized School, dean of the College of Arts at Wuhan University, chairman of the Department of Foreign Languages at the College of Arts of Nanjing Central University, professor and dean of the College of Arts at Qingdao University, professor at the National Political School, professor in the Department of Chinese Literature at Tsinghua University, lecturer at Peking University, and professor in the Department of Literature at Southwest Associated University. Mr. Wen is a nationally renowned writer and an authoritative researcher of ancient Chinese literature. He has written extensively throughout his life, especially in the creation of new poetry. His poetry collection "Dead Water" is widely circulated throughout the country. He has also translated many Chinese poems into English and translated Shakespeare's historical poems into Chinese, making many contributions to cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries. Many literary critics consider Mr. Wen to be China's first new poet. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Wen taught at Southwest Associated University and devoted himself to the patriotic movement, enjoying extremely high prestige among students and being one of the leaders of the democratic movement in Kunming. Mr. Wen deeply resented Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship and autocracy. In 1944, Mr. Wen exposed the authorities' attempts to gloss over the situation and called on young people to rise up and save the country. For this, he was once ordered to be dismissed by the authorities. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Wen continued to fight for China's independence, peace, and democracy, appealing and advocating, which led to his assassination by the Kuomintang fascists.
