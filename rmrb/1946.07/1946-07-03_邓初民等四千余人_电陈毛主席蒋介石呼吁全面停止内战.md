Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th. Prominent figures from all walks of life, including Huang Mohan, Huang Cixian, and Deng Chumin, along with 4,271 others, recently jointly telegraphed Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nationalist Government, emphasizing the current profound national crisis and calling for a complete ceasefire and an extension of the consultation period. All political issues should be resolved through political means. The original telegram is recorded as follows:

　　Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Mao Runzhi:

　　The people's blood and sweat during the eight years of the War of Resistance have been exhausted. The once prosperous areas are now disaster-stricken. Everywhere is scarred, and bones litter the fields. Prices are soaring, people's livelihoods are declining, production is stagnating, labor unrest is incessant, transportation is blocked, and commerce is cut off. Foreign goods are pouring in, leading to economic bankruptcy. Even public school teachers are striking and seeking help. Such a tragic scene! How can we bear to see the disaster of war again!? This dispute is a political issue and should be resolved through political consultation, not by military means. With a heart that cannot bear to see people suffer, implement policies that cannot bear to see people suffer. Place the people's interests above all else. Be open and honest, understand each other, and what cannot be agreed upon and achieved? Currently, the sound of gunfire still fills the air. If it is not stopped, long-term chaos will ensue. The future of the nation and the people is truly unimaginable! Our hearts are in danger, as if pounding and burning! Therefore, we appeal:

　　(1) Complete ceasefire and restoration of transportation.

　　(2) The consultation period may be extended.

　　(3) Consultation and negotiation must succeed and not fail, in order to realize the late Father of the Nation's will of peaceful struggle and build a new China of peace, unity, democracy, and unification.

　　We risk our lives to speak frankly, and we hope you will understand!

　　Huang Mohan, Huang Cixian, Deng Chumin and 4,271 others, together.
