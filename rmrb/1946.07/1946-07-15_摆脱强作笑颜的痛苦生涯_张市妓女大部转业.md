　　Getting Rid of the Painful Life of Forced Smiles
　　Most Prostitutes in Zhang City Change Professions
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 12th] Most of the prostitutes in Zhang City, who were left over from the feudal society under the rule of the enemy and puppets in the past, have changed professions or returned to their hometowns. When Zhang City was first liberated, there were 1,200 prostitutes and 70 to 80 open and secret brothels. Recently, there are only 17 brothels and 102 prostitutes left. According to the Zhang City government's decree, prostitutes can leave brothels unconditionally. A treatment center has been set up, paying tens of thousands of yuan in medical expenses every month to treat their diseases. According to statistics from the treatment center, most prostitutes suffer from venereal diseases such as syphilis and gonorrhea. Li Jinxian, a prostitute from the Juhuan brothel, suffered from five kinds of venereal diseases. Under the boss's coercion, she had to force a smile to receive customers every day, and was later ordered to stop business by the treatment center. Yang Shulin, a prostitute under the age of 20, crawled up and down the steps when she went to the treatment center. She cried to the treatment staff about her pain and was rescued. The prostitutes who have been rescued have been introduced to jobs by the government and women's organizations, or subsidized to return to their hometowns to engage in production. A few remaining people who have not yet escaped from the fire pit have also written letters to the treatment center and the government requesting prompt assistance.

　　摆脱强作笑颜的痛苦生涯
　  张市妓女大部转业
    【新华社张家口十二日电】过去敌伪统治封建社会遗留下来的张市娼妓，绝大部分已改业或回乡。张市刚解放时娼妓达一千二百人，明暗妓馆七八十家，至最近，妓馆仅余十七家，妓女一百零二名。根据张市政府法令，娼妓可以无条件脱离妓馆，并设置检治所，每月支付十数万元医药费，以治疗他们的疾病，据检治所统计，妓女大部患有梅毒淋病等恶疾，聚寰妓馆妓女李金仙，竟患有五种性病，而在老板鞭策下，每日必须强作笑颜接客，后始为检治所勒令停业。不满二十岁的妓女杨淑林，去检治所时，上下台阶都是爬着走，她向检治人员哭诉苦痛，当予援救。现已解救之妓女均经政府及妇女团体介绍职业，或资助她们回乡生产，所余少数尚未脱离火坑者，亦纷纷写信给检治所和政府请求速予援助。
