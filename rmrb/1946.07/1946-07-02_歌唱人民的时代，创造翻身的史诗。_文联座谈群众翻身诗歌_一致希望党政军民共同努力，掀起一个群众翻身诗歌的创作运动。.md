　　Singing of the Era of the People, Creating an Epic of Emancipation.
    Literary Federation Symposium on Mass Emancipation Poetry
    Unanimous Hope for Joint Efforts by Party, Government, Military, and People to Launch a Creative Movement of Mass Emancipation Poetry.
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] In the vigorous mass movements across the region, the masses have not only begun to turn themselves around politically and economically but have also been initially liberated from the shackles of feudal ideology. Reflecting the masses' self-liberation, emancipation poetry has also emerged, truly forming an era of "masses emancipated, singing and enjoying themselves." The Border Region Literary Federation recently received several mass emancipation poems collected from Taiyue, Taihang, and Jiluyu areas (to be published in the second issue of "Northern Magazine"). After deliberation by various parties, a symposium on mass emancipation poetry was held at 5 p.m. on the 25th of this month at the Xinxing Goods Store guesthouse in Handan City. Sun Dingguo, Deputy Commander of the Taiyue Military Region, Gu Dachuan, Political Commissar, and Comrade Li Zheren, Leng Chu from the Taihang District Party Committee, Yu Yichuan from the Second District Committee, Ren Baige and Chen Feiqin, Director and Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Military Region's Political Department, and Huangmei, Heiding, Zeng Ke, and Hu Zheng from the Literary Federation, as well as Yuan Bo from this newspaper, participated. The meeting was presided over by Huangmei. After reciting several mass emancipation poems from Taiyue and other places, the discussion began. Everyone expressed great excitement about the emergence of mass emancipation poems everywhere in the region. Deputy Commander Sun, after introducing the situation of mass creation of poems in the mass movement in the Taiyue area, said: I hope that the Party, government, military, and people will work together to launch a creative movement of mass emancipation poetry. Comrade Yu Yichuan believes that mass poetry must be created collectively by the masses. He cited the communication work in the Taihang area as an example, saying that it can only be done well by mobilizing the vast number of workers, peasants, soldiers, and their cadres to create. Comrade Li Zheren hopes that all parties, especially those engaged in cultural work, will cherish the current era of mass emancipation, value the enthusiasm and budding works of the masses who are beginning to sing for themselves, strengthen leadership, and not miss the opportunity. He hopes that comrades engaged in poetry work can immerse themselves in this great furnace of mass movement, temper their thoughts and feelings, learn from the masses, and liberate their thoughts and feelings from the old circles. Comrade Leng Chu said: The mass emancipation movement is also a great ideological movement. After the masses are emancipated, their cultural demands will inevitably increase. We should widely collect and reward mass creations, spread them to each other, and promote each other. The Party should lead the development of this cultural movement well. Comrade Yuan Bo used his own experience in writing poetry to illustrate that in the future, poetry workers should combine with the masses, learn from the masses, serve the masses, and open up a new path for mass poetry. Finally, comrades Ren Baige and Chen Feiqin, and others, put forward many specific opinions on the future poetry movement. The discussion, held in an extremely joyful atmosphere, did not end until 9 p.m. This symposium will greatly promote the mass poetry movement in the entire border region in the future.

　　歌唱人民的时代，创造翻身的史诗。
    文联座谈群众翻身诗歌
    一致希望党政军民共同努力，掀起一个群众翻身诗歌的创作运动。
    【本报特讯】在全区各地轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，群众不仅从政治上、经济上开始翻过身来，而且从封建思想枷锁中初步解放出来，反映群众自求解放的翻身诗歌，也应运而生，真正形成了一个“群众翻身，自唱自乐”的时代。边区文联最近接获太岳、太行、冀鲁豫等地所搜集的群众翻身诗歌数首（将在《北方杂志》第二期刊登），经各方酝酿，于本月二十五日下午五时，假邯郸市新兴货栈客房，举行群众翻身诗歌漫谈会，太岳军区孙副司令员定国、顾政委大川、李哲人同志、太行区党委冷楚同志、二地委于一川同志、军区政治部宣传部任白戈、陈斐琴正副部长、文联荒煤、黑丁、曾克、胡征，本报袁勃等同志均参加。会议由荒煤主持，在朗诵太岳等地的几首群众翻身诗歌后，即开始漫谈。大家对目前全区到处产生了群众翻身的诗歌，感到极大兴奋，孙副司令员于介绍太岳区群运中群众创作之诗歌情形后说：希望党政军民共同努力，来掀起一个群众翻身的诗歌创作运动。于一川同志认为，群众的诗歌，必须要群众集体来创作，他举太行区的通讯工作为例，只有发动广大工农兵群众及其干部来创作，才能作好。李哲人同志希望各方，特别是作文化工作的同志，要珍惜目前这个群众翻身的时代，宝贵群众开始自己歌唱的热情与萌芽的作品，加强领导，不要错过时机。对于作诗歌工作的同志，希望能投入这个群众运动的大烘炉中去，锻炼自己的思想感情，向群众学习使自己的思想感情从旧的圈子中解脱出来。冷楚同志说：群众翻身运动，也是一个大思想运动，在群众翻身之后，群众文化要求必然提高，我们应广为征集与奖励群众的创作，互相传播，互相推动，党应很好来领导这一文化运动的开展。袁勃同志用自己写诗的经验说明今后诗歌工作者应结合群众向群众学习，为群众服务，开辟群众诗歌的新道路。最后任白戈、陈斐琴等同志，对今后诗歌运动都提了很多具体意见，在极度欢快的空气中，欢谈至夜九时始散。这次漫谈会，对全边区今后的群众诗歌运动，将起很大推动作用。
