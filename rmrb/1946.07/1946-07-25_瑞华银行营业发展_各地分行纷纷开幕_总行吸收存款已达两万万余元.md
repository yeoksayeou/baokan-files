    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Ruihua Bank branches are opening and commencing business in various locations. People from all walks of life continue to enthusiastically subscribe for shares. As of the end of June, statistics from Handan, Xingtai, Jincheng, Nangong, and Linqing alone show a total of 235 million yuan. The Xingtai branch opened on July 8th and absorbed deposits of 100.5 million yuan that day. From the 8th to the 12th, within four days, it issued a total of 55 million yuan in fixed-term loans, current loans, interbank transactions, and industrial investments to 102 clients. The Changzhi branch opened on July 6th and absorbed deposits of 15 million yuan on that day, along with new share capital from sixteen households totaling 87,000 yuan. Farmer Yang Taifu invested in a small share of 1,000 yuan and excitedly told others, "In the past, banks were opened by officials, and we had no chance to subscribe or get loans. Today, I put 1,000 yuan of my earnings into the bank as a shareholder and even have priority for loans." By July 10th, the branch had absorbed a total of 22.4 million yuan in deposits, issued various loans amounting to 8.13 million yuan, and managed warehouse operations worth 5 million yuan. The Jincheng branch is scheduled to open on July 25th. Because of its location inland, the branch focuses on absorbing shares from rural areas. On May 23rd, it invited 123 people, including cooperative managers, farmer representatives, labor heroes, and gentry, for a discussion. Among them, 118 people automatically participated in initiating assistance for fundraising. Many farmers who had turned their lives around actively subscribed for shares. Currently, Jincheng County alone has raised 4 million yuan, with the total for the entire branch not less than 30 million yuan. The future policy of the branch is mainly to support the iron industry, planning to use 30 percent of its funds for iron industry investment and 20 percent for handicrafts and cooperative loans. From mid-June to early July, the Nangong branch received a total of 460 million yuan in deposits, 8.8 million yuan in current loans, and 5.9 million yuan in interbank transactions. From June 11th to the end of the month, the Handan Head Office absorbed a total of 253 million yuan in deposits and 120 million yuan in various loans.
