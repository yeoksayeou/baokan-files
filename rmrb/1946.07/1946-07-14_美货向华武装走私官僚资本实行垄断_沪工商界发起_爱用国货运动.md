Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th – Guangzhou dispatch: American goods (including drugs) are entering South China in large quantities under armed smuggling. Most of the smuggled goods are transshipped from Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is a free port where foreign goods do not need to be taxed. Hong Kong's import and export business is experiencing unprecedented prosperity. In the first four months of this year, the value of imported goods reached HK$196 million, an increase of more than HK$13 million compared with the same period in 19XX. Exports during the same period amounted to HK$140 million. American goods are not only dumped in Hong Kong but also transferred to South China in large quantities. In mid-June, the prices of American goods in Hong Kong plummeted. Assorted brands of oatmeal fell from HK$90 per box to HK$41, transparent raincoats fell from over HK$70 to HK$25, and toothbrushes fell from HK$4 to HK$1.20. These low-priced goods drove straight in, and Doushan in Taishan, Hengmen along the Pearl River, Shantou, Xiamen and other places along the South China coast have become channels for armed smuggling by "maritime heroes." Some also detour through Danshui and other places, landing and importing through Huiyang. Smugglers even openly transport opium paste and gasoline. In April, an armed vessel smuggling x oil (worth more than 30 million yuan) from Hong Kong to Humen occurred, and the smugglers fired machine guns at customs officers. Customs officers are also often bribed to assist in smuggling, and the amount of smuggling is staggering. At present, the Yuehai Customs collects only 80 million yuan in tax per month, with tax evasion reaching a huge 1.5 billion yuan. Under such circumstances, South China has become an exclusive territory for American goods. The dumping of cigarettes has caused 60 out of 99 cigarette factories in Guangzhou to switch industries. The cigarette industry in Huiyang, Chaoyang and other places has also closed down one after another.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th – Bureaucratic capital within the Kuomintang, wearing the guise of "state-owned," is increasingly expanding its monopoly over light and heavy industries. The China Textile Construction Corporation monopolizes the spinning, dyeing, and weaving industries. The China Silk Company monopolizes the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Ministry of Economic Affairs monopolizes the mining of important coal, iron, silver, gold, aluminum, magnesium, tin, tungsten, and petroleum mines nationwide, as well as industries such as steel, machinery, electrical appliances, chemicals, and sugar. The Ministry of Transportation monopolizes railways, ships, automobiles, aviation, and all related manufacturing industries. The Ministry of Food monopolizes industries such as flour, rice milling, and oil extraction. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry took over agricultural implement factories and farms. The Ministry of Education took over various industries related to cultural undertakings. In addition, under the name of joint ventures between the Resources Commission and the Relief Administration, companies such as sugar, cement, paper, and fertilizer were established. Bureaucratic capital also controls the Resources Commission and controls the power in North China and the Jiangnan region. The Fuel Committee controls the transportation and sales of coal and monopolizes raw materials and equipment. China Textile monopolizes imported cotton and wool. The Central Printing Bureau monopolizes pulp, etc. This monopoly by bureaucratic capital within the Kuomintang, coupled with the massive dumping of American goods, has forced national private industries across the country to the verge of destruction.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th – Shanghai dispatch: The Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made National Products Factories decided at a meeting of representatives of its members on the 12th of last month to jointly launch the "Love Our National Products Movement" to awaken compatriots across the country to be proud of using national products and not to purchase and sell foreign goods that affect China's economy. At the same time, it was decided to request the authorities to restrict the import of non-essential goods, and to prohibit the import of items that can be made in the country. After the meeting, all members of the Shanghai Third District Department Store Trade Association responded first, intending to use their advantageous position as sales staff to persuade customers to buy domestic products as much as possible. It is also planned to convene a meeting of representatives of department store employees in the city within the next few days to discuss promotion and publicity methods. It is reported that other trade associations also intend to take action to save the national industry from the current crisis of American goods flooding the market.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th – Chongqing dispatch: The Fuel Control Committee of the Kuomintang government's Ministry of Economic Affairs recently ordered hundreds of tons of coal from San Francisco, USA. Furthermore, after the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Coal Mine Management Office was ordered to be abolished last month, it announced the cessation of coal originally ordered from various mines in the Fengjie, Yunyang, and Xiadong coal areas. More than ten companies, including Hengyi and Yonghe, whose government-purchased coal could not be sold, have closed down and ceased production.

　　美货向华武装走私官僚资本实行垄断
　　沪工商界发起“爱用国货运动”
    【新华社南京十日电】广州讯：美国商品（包括毒品）在武装走私下，正大批侵入华南。所有侵入的货物，大部分是从香港转口而来，因为香港是个自由港口，外货不需在此纳税。现香港的出入口事业空前的繁荣。本年度首四个月，入口货物价值达港币一万九千六百万元，较一九××年同期增加一千三百余万港元。同期出口数字为一万四千万港元。美国商品不仅在香港倾销，而且大批转至华南。上月中旬，香港的美货价格剧跌，杂牌麦片从每箱九十港元跌到四十一港元，透明雨衣自七十余元跌至二十五元，牙刷自四元跌至一元二角。这种低价商品长驱直入，华南沿海的台山属斗山，珠江沿岸的横门，汕头，厦门等地，已成“海上英雄”们武装走私的孔道。并有绕道淡水等地着陆由惠阳进口者。走私者甚至公开运鸦片烟膏、汽油等，四月间且曾发生从香港偷运×油（值三千余万元）至虎门的武装船只，以机枪扫射缉私者之事。海关缉私人员，亦常受贿，帮助走私，走私数额惊人。目前粤海关每月税收仅八万万元，逃税达十五万万元之巨。在如此情况下，华南已成为美货独占地盘。香烟的倾销，致使广州九十九家烟厂转业者达六十余家。惠阳、潮阳各地卷烟业亦纷纷倒闭。
    【新华社南京十日电】国民党内官僚资本穿了“国营”的外衣，对轻重工业的垄断日见扩张。中国纺织建设公司垄断了纺染织业。中国蚕丝公司独占了江浙的蚕丝事业。经济部独占了全国重要的煤、铁、银、金、铝、镁、锡、钨和石油等矿的开采，以及钢铁、机械、电器、化学和制糖等工业。交通部独占了铁道、轮船、汽车、航空及其有关的一切制造工业。粮食部独占了面粉、碾米、榨油等工业。农林部接办了农具工厂和农场。教育部接办了和文化事业有关的各种工业。此外，在资源委员会与救济行署合办的名义下，又成立了糖业、水泥、纸业、肥料等公司。官僚资本并控制了资源委官会，控制了华北、江南的电力。燃料委员会统制了煤的运销，独占了原料和器材。中纺独占了输入的棉花和羊毛。中央印制局独占了纸浆等等。国民党内官僚资本的此种垄断，加上美货的大量倾销，已迫使全国民营工业陷于毁灭的边缘。
    【新华社延安十一日电】沪讯：沪市机制国货工厂联合会，于上月十二日各会员代表大会上，决定联合各界发起“爱用国货运动”，唤起全国同胞以服用国货为荣，勿购销外货而影响中国经济。同时决定要求当局限制非必需之货物进口，凡本国可制物品，亦应禁止进口。会后沪市第三区百货业职业公会全体会员首先响应，拟以销货职员之有利地位，将国产物品尽量向买客劝销。并定日内集合全市百货业职工代表举行会议，讨论推销及宣传方法。闻其他各业公会亦拟有所行动，以挽救目前美货泛滥下民族工业之危机。
    【新华社延安十一日电】渝讯：国民党政府经济部燃料管制委员会，近向美旧金山订购煤料数百吨。又经济部煤矿管理处上月奉令裁撤后，将该处原订购奉节，云阳、下东煤区各矿之煤，宣示停止，政府原购煤无法销售相继关门停工者，已有恒益、永合等十余家。
