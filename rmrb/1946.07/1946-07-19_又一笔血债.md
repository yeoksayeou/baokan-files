Another Debt of Blood
　　Qian Junrui
　　Suddenly, I received the news that Mr. Li Gongpu, an important leader of the China National Salvation Association, was assassinated by Chiang Kai-shek's fascist secret agents in Kunming.
　　In this bloody country of ours, the most despicable means of the fascist bandits has added another debt of blood that people will forever remember.
　　Perhaps the heads of the Chinese fascists and their followers are thinking of using their bloody hands to frighten people, so that they dare not move? But throughout history, bloodthirsty autocratic tyrants have never been able to suppress the people's resistance. For example, in the past twenty years, the Kuomintang reactionaries have slaughtered tens of millions of Communists and good people. Recently, they also killed Li Zhaolin, Sun Pingtan, and Wang Rennong. But have the Communists or the Chinese people ever been intimidated by them? Have they ever surrendered in the face of their butcher knives! As the saying goes, "The people do not fear death, why threaten them with death?" The Chinese people have struggled for so many years for their own independence, freedom, and liberation, for such lofty and glorious goals. Are they still afraid of the poisonous hands of these fascist villains?
　　Perhaps the heads of the Chinese fascists and their followers think that killing one Li Gongpu will silence the democrats! But don't these fascist bandits even have this little bit of common sense? "Blocking the people's mouths is more dangerous than blocking a river." The mouths of the people cannot be silenced. If one Li Gongpu is killed, thousands upon thousands of Li Gongpus will stand up to speak. This voice will ultimately drown out all the dregs of history, leaving them utterly gone.
　　Perhaps the heads of the Chinese fascists and their followers are planning that killing one Li Gongpu will eliminate one leader of the democratic movement. But these cruel and extremely stupid fascist vermin cannot understand such a truth: due to the justness and great creativity of the people's movement, countless leaders and new cadres will inevitably emerge continuously. The death of Mr. Li Gongpu will call on thousands upon thousands of democratic fighters to be more vigilant and step forward to take over Mr. Gongpu's position and fight for Mr. Gongpu's legacy.
　　Therefore, all the plans of the fascist reactionaries are in vain for the Chinese people and for the now powerful movement for independence, peace, and democracy in China.
　　Therefore, the assassination of Mr. Gongpu by the fascist reactionaries can only more clearly expose the extreme cruelty and insidiousness of Chiang Kai-shek and his fascist partisans. It can only show that the Chinese people cannot obtain any freedom from the fascist reactionaries that they have promised verbally. If there is any, it is their freedom to carry out terror. It can only show that Chiang Kai-shek's "evil government" is not only continuing to expand the civil war to the Liberated Areas, but is also carrying out bloody operations against the unarmed peaceful residents in the Kuomintang areas. It can only once again show how shameful and ridiculous Chiang Kai-shek's lies are when he says, "As long as the Communist Party hands over its troops and lays down its weapons, it can obtain security and democracy." Mr. Gongpu had no weapons or troops, why did you want to harm him? Finally, this tragic killing can only prove how powerfully the reactionary policies and military and economic aid of the American imperialists are supporting and fueling the killing business of Chiang Kai-shek's "evil government."
　　This is another signal of Chiang Kai-shek's implementation of a fascist massacre throughout the country. Now Mr. Gongpu has been killed. He died gloriously in the post of a national fighter. Under Chiang Kai-shek's murder, he fell in his own boiling hot and bright red pool of blood. Because of the irrigation of his blood, the wild fields of the motherland will surely be covered with "Flowers of May," which he most liked to sing, these fighting flowers that are pregnant with an infinitely bright future. No matter how brutal the reactionaries are, the cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy will surely be victorious.
　　Regarding Gongpu's death, as a dear friend, I have no tears, only hatred. We want to accuse the Chinese fascist reactionaries of such heinous crimes to the world. This is such a heavy debt of blood! We and all democrats understand what should be used to repay it.

### 又一笔血债

　　又一笔血债
    钱俊瑞
    突然得到消息，中国人民救国会的重要负责人之一李公朴先生，在昆明被蒋记法西斯特务暗杀了。
    这样在我们这个血腥的国度里，又由法西斯匪徒最卑污的手段，添了一笔已使人们永远记住的血债。
    也许，中国法西斯的头目及其徒子徒孙们，满想靠着他们的一双血手来吓倒人，使人从此不敢动弹吧？但是在全部历史上杀人不眨眼的专制魔王，从未曾压服得了人民的反抗。即如国民党反动派在这二十年来，他们屠杀了成千万的共产党员和善良的老百姓，在最近他们还杀了李兆麟、孙平天、王任农，但是共产党员全中国的老百姓曾经有那一次给他们吓倒过？在他们的屠刀面前表示屈服过！古话说的好：“民不畏死奈何以死惧之。”中国人民为了求得自己的独立自由和解放，为了这样崇高和光荣的目标前仆后继地奋斗了这许多年，难道还怕他们这批法西斯宵小的毒手不成。
    也许中国法西斯的头目及其徒子徒孙们，以为杀了一个李公朴就可以灭掉民主分子的口吧！但是这些法西斯匪徒难道连这一点点子常识都没有？“防民之口甚于防川。”人民的嘴是灭不掉的，杀了一个李公朴会有几千几万个李公朴站出来讲话，这声音将最终的淹没一切历史的渣滓，让他们荡然无存。
    也许中国法西斯的头目及其徒子徒孙们这样打算着，杀了一个李公朴就少了一个民主运动的领头人。但是残酷和愚蠢到极顶的法西斯害虫们，就不会了解这么一条真理，由于人民运动的正义性和伟大的创造力，无数的领袖和新干部必然源源不绝地产生出来。李公朴先生的死，将号召几千几万个民主战士更加警惕并挺身而出来接替公朴先生的岗位，为公朴先生的遗志而斗争。
    因此法西斯反动派的一切打算，对于中国人民来说，对于中国现在强大的求取独立和平民主运动来说，都是枉然的。
    因此法西斯反动派的暗杀公朴先生，只能更加明白地暴露蒋介石及其法西斯党羽的极端残忍和险毒，只能说明中国人民从法西斯反动派手里不能得到任何他们在口头上也曾允诺过的自由。如果有，那就是他们实行恐怖的自由，只能说明蒋介石的“恶政府”今天不仅在向解放区继续扩大内战，而且也正在向国民党地区手无寸铁的和平居民进行血腥的作战，只能再一次说明蒋介石所说的“只要共产党交出军队，放下武器，便可以得到安全与民主”，是何等可耻和可笑的撒谎。公朴先生既无武器更无军队，为什么你竟要加以残害？最后这一惨杀只能证明美国帝国主义分子的反动政策和军事经济援助，是如何有力的支持和助长着蒋介石“恶政府”的杀人事业。
    这又是蒋介石在全国实行法西斯大屠杀的信号，现在公朴先生是被杀害了，他光荣地死在一个民族战士的岗位上，在蒋介石的谋害下他在自己的沸热鲜红的血泊中倒下了，由于他这鲜血的灌溉，在祖国的原野上，必然会开遍正如他所最欢喜唱的《五月的鲜花》，这战斗的孕育着无限光明前途的鲜花。不管反动派如何凶残，中国独立和平民主事业是一定要胜利的。
    对于公朴的死，作为一个亲爱的朋友来说，我没有眼泪，只有憎恨。我们要向全世界控诉中国法西斯反动派这样滔天的罪行，这是一笔多么沉重的血债呀！我们和一切民主人士是都懂得了应该用什么来偿还的。
    （七月十三日）
