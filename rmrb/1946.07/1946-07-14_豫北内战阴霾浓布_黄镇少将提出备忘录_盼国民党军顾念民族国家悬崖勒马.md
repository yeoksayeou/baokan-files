　　War Clouds Gather Over Northern Henan
　  Major General Huang Zhen Submits Memorandum
　　Hoping Nationalist Troops Will Consider the Nation and State and Pull Back from the Brink
    [This dispatch from our newspaper’s Handan office, dated the 7th] The Communist representative of the Xinxiang Group, Major General Huang Zhen, pointed out in a memorandum to the group today (the 7th) that, according to reliable information: The Nationalist Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters is now actively deploying a large-scale military offensive against our northern Henan and western Shandong areas. The participating forces include the 31st Army Group, the 4th Army Group, the main force of the Fourth Pacification Zone of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters, as well as air force and tank units. The 31st Army Group will use all its strength to invade our Jiaozuo and Qinyang areas. Secondly, it was explained that since the ceasefire order, the Nationalist army's offensive actions against us in violation of orders have never ceased. Our army has always emphasized peace and adopted a policy of forbearance. We still hope that the Nationalist army will consider the nation and the people, pull back from the brink, immediately stop all its military deployments, and cease executing its planned combat plans.
    [This dispatch from our newspaper’s Handan office, dated the 9th] Nationalist planes have been actively assisting the Chiang's puppet troops attacking our northern Henan, southern Hebei, and western Shandong liberated areas with large quantities of military supplies and ammunition for days, and conducting frantic strafing and bombing against local residents and our army. At 10:00 AM on the 4th, two Nationalist planes flew over the Nationalist 53rd Division over Yezhu Potou and other places in Meng County, dropping large quantities of ammunition. The next day, two planes transporting ammunition, after completing their mission, strafed residents for 40 minutes between Baipo and Yezhu in Meng County on the north bank of the Yellow River, and dropped two bombs at the Yellow River ferry in the county, sinking a civilian boat, resulting in extremely heavy losses for the residents. On July 1st, Nationalist planes again supported the puppet troops entrenched in Zhaogu, Huixian County, with five artillery pieces and some military supplies, and strafed the surrounding residents. The puppet troops entrenched in Lincheng, western Shandong, are even more frequently assisted by Nationalist planes from Xuzhou, even up to three or four times a day. On the 25th of last month, five Nationalist planes transported 50 boxes of ammunition from Xuzhou to supply the Lincheng puppet troops, of which 45 boxes landed in our army's position. Due to the active assistance of the Nationalist Air Force, the Chiang's puppet troops attacking in various places have become increasingly rampant.

    【本报邯郸九日电】国民党飞机连日以大批军火子弹积极资助向我豫北冀南鲁西解放区进攻之蒋伪军，并向当地居民与我军进行疯狂扫射与轰炸。四日上午十时，国民党飞机两架，飞至侵入孟县冶戌坡头等地国民党五十三师上空，投下大批军火子弹，次日，运送子弹的该机两架于完成任务之后，在黄河北岸孟县白坡冶戍间向居民扫射四十分钟，并在该县黄河渡口投弹两枚，击沉民船一只，居民损失极重。七月一日，国民党飞机又以大炮五门，军用物资一部，支援盘据辉县赵固之伪军，并扫射周围居民。四日济南国民党飞机五架，飞往冀南聊城以西我军驻地，大肆轰炸扫射，以帮助聊城伪军向我进攻。盘据鲁西临城的伪军，更是经常得到国民党徐州飞机的援助，甚至每日达三四次之多。上月二十五日，国民党飞机五架，由徐州运送子弹五十箱接济临城伪军，其中四十五箱均落于我军阵地。由于国民党空军的积极援助，致各地进攻的蒋伪军，更日益猖獗。
