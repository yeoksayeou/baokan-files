　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 6th: The righteous act of Captain Liu Shanben and others of the 35th Squadron of the 8th Group of the Central Aviation of the Kuomintang, who resolutely flew to Yan'an and withdrew from the civil war, has been warmly welcomed and praised by people from all walks of life in Yan'an. Representatives of mass organizations such as the Border Region Federation of Trade Unions, the Youth League, and the Women's Federation sent letters of condolence upon hearing the news. Yesterday, when the news was published in large characters on the blackboard newspaper in the New Market, crowds immediately gathered to see it. Staff members of the Grain Bureau, who happened to be returning from weeding in Shangyuan, stood by the blackboard newspaper and read it aloud to illiterate farmers seven or eight times. An old farmer named Liu Wenbin, who came to the Qilipu market, excitedly said: "All Chinese people have listened to Chairman Mao's words and oppose the civil war. Chiang Kai-shek wants to kill farmers, and the people unanimously oppose it." Citizen Zhang Wenkui expressed his warm welcome to Captain Liu's righteous act and expressed his indignation at the American aid to Chiang. He said: "Even though we are illiterate, can't we see the black heart of the American reactionaries? They are helping Chiang Kai-shek to kill Chinese people, so that they can treat Chinese people as their slaves and beasts of burden." Jiang Guisheng, the owner of the Yisheng Oil Paint Shop, said humorously: "The ground troops are unwilling to fight the civil war, and the air troops are unwilling to fight either. Let Chiang Kai-shek fight alone." The people around him were amused. Citizens suggested sending condolences to Captain Liu and other pilots, and Wang Kewen, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, immediately bought five packs of [unspecified brand] and a carton of cigarettes and asked the reporter to give them to them. The soldiers guarding the airport told reporters that they are the people's army and must defend the people. When the B-24 No. 530 aircraft landed, they were very angry. "But," Du Fu said, "when it became clear that they came to oppose the civil war, I was very happy and welcomed them."
