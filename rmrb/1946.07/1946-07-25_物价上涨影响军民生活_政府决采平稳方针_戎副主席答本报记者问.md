　　Price Hikes Affect Military and Civilian Life
    Government Decides on Stabilization Policy
    Vice Chairman Rong Answers Our Reporter's Questions
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In recent months, prices have generally risen in various border regions, especially noticeably in July, increasing by four to five times compared to before April. Such price fluctuations have had an impact on the lives of people from all walks of life in the border region. In response, this reporter visited Vice Chairman Rong of the Border Region Government, who provided the following answers:

    Question: Price hikes are of great concern to people from all walks of life. Could you tell us the reasons for these increases?

    Answer: There are three reasons for the price hikes: First, the stimulation of the civil war. Due to the active launch of civil war by the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the military assistance of American reactionaries, the situation is becoming increasingly serious. The tragedy of civil war stimulates everyone's psychology. People have learned from experience that prices will inevitably rise in the event of war, so they are throwing out currency and purchasing goods, which has led to price increases and currency depreciation. In addition, secret agents spread rumors and disrupt finances, causing the market to lose stability. Second, the influence of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Most parts of China are under Kuomintang rule, with exorbitant taxes and levies, forced conscription, corruption, and waste, resulting in the stagnation of most industrial and agricultural production. Furthermore, the dumping of goods by American imperialism and the monopoly of the economy by bureaucratic capital have further depressed national industries. The "evil government" of the Kuomintang has caused famine in nineteen provinces across the country, with approximately forty million disaster victims lacking food and clothing, suffering from hunger and cold, forming a general shortage of supplies and demand exceeding supply, with prices four to five thousand times higher than before the war. This external price influence has caused our region's materials to flow out, making it difficult to avoid price increases. Third, we have not been strict enough in managing imports and exports in the past six months, it can be said that we have almost let it be. A large amount of supplies from the liberated areas, especially grain, cotton, and native cloth, have flowed out, and a large number of luxury goods such as foreign cigarettes and foreign alcohol have been imported. Smuggling is very serious, and foreign exchange has not been well managed. The exchange of essential goods in and out has lost stability, causing price fluctuations.

    In addition to objective reasons for the above phenomenon, subjectively, we have insufficient understanding of the Kuomintang fascist reactionary conspiracy, overestimate peace, and have political paralysis and relaxed fighting will. The behavior of some comrades in individual departments, who see the small and not the big, violating policies and regulations, is also very harmful.

    Question: Are price hikes absolutely unfavorable to us, and what effective measures can be taken to stabilize prices at present?

    Answer: Sharp rises and falls in prices, instability, is absolutely unfavorable to us. Looking at the price index since March, the initial fluctuation was faster in grain, cotton, and cloth, which may not be significant for the entire liberated area, but it is too unfavorable for industries, small handicrafts, side businesses, small businesses, and military and government circles that are not on a supply system. In the second period of fluctuation, foreign goods and grain, cotton went up together, even exceeding the trend, which is very unfavorable to us. It can be said that soaring prices only benefit a few who master floating capital for speculation, hoarding, and profiteering, and are unfavorable to the entire liberated area's production and construction. Therefore, we must adopt a stabilization policy to overcome the current situation of price fluctuations. Our approach is:

    Strict Trade Management, Banning Smuggling, Publicly Owned Stores Should Buy Cheap and Sell Dear

    First, strengthen the industrial and commercial tax bureau institutions, strictly organize and manage foreign trade, prohibit luxury goods such as foreign cigarettes, foreign oil, and wool from entering the country, and restrict the import of paper, matches, and pigments, and prohibit the export of grain, cotton, and native cloth. Smuggling must be banned, regardless of any agency, group, or department, all must abide by trade policies and laws without exception, and implement foreign exchange management, exchanging our essential goods for our necessities. However, trade in the interior is completely free, and no region or special county can implement blockades without authorization, so as not to hinder the exchange of materials and stifle economic activity.

    Second, tighten the money supply. In terms of finance, we must pay attention to increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Banks must immediately stop all commercial loans, and those that have expired must be resolutely recovered. Those that have not expired can be recovered in whole or in part depending on the circumstances. In the future, loans should be directed towards industries, agriculture, transportation, and other undertakings. Expenses and operating funds that have been received but not used by government departments at all levels must be returned to the finance department and placed in warehouses. In the future, expenses must be drawn monthly in accordance with audit and accounting systems, and no advance loans are allowed to avoid the private use of public funds.

    Third, unify the management of agency stores. In addition to obtaining some profits in business activities, agency stores are also responsible for regulating materials, stabilizing prices, consolidating the currency, and stabilizing finance. The practice should be to buy and sell at any time, not to hoard and speculate, and should be "buy cheap and sell dear" (that is, when prices are cheap, I want to buy higher than the market price, and when prices are expensive, I want to sell lower than the market price), not "do not buy when cheap, do not sell when expensive" (when cheap, I do not buy, or buy lower than the market price, when expensive, I do not sell, or sell higher than the market price), and even more should not buy expensive and never sell. It should be known that the purpose of agency production is to solve the difficulties of the agency, subsidize the lack of public finance, and reduce the burden on the people; if our wrong practices cause prices to rise, this will not only fail to solve the difficulties of the agency, but will also have the opposite result, which will lose our original intention.

    Fourth, regulate materials, improve transportation, and any stores that have food, cotton, cloth, and salt should release part or most of it at any time to regulate the market, depending on the circumstances. Several economic roads in the interior should be repaired as soon as possible to reduce expenses and save people and animal power for transportation. Mass transportation cooperatives, transportation mutual aid groups, and transportation teams should also be organized in a planned way to engage in transportation during the slack farming season.

    Vice Chairman Rong finally firmly stated: As long as everyone is united in understanding and can implement the above four measures, if there are no unexpected disasters, prices in our region will stabilize.

                                                          (End)

　　物价上涨影响军民生活
    政府决采平稳方针         
    戎副主席答本报记者问
    【本报特讯】近数月来，边区各地物价普遍上涨，七月份特别明显，比四月份以前竟上涨了四五倍。物价如此波动，对边区各阶层人民的生活，不无影响，记者为此特走访边府戎副主席，承答复如下：
    问：物价上涨，各阶层人民极为关切，请告上涨原因何在？
    答：物价上涨，其原因有三：一、内战刺激。由于国民党反动派在美国反动派的军事援助下，积极发动内战，使时局日趋严重，内战惨祸刺激了每个人的心理，人民经验，战争如起物价必然高涨，因此都抛出通货，收购物资，因之便造成了物价上涨，币值跌落。再加上特务分子造谣捣乱金融，因之市场更失去平稳。二、国民党统治区给与影响。中国大部地区，由于国民党统治，苛捐杂税，横征暴敛，抓丁勒役，贪污浪费，致工农生产大部停顿；又加美帝国主义之货物倾销，官僚资本垄断经济，民族工业更一蹶不振。国民党“恶政府”之苛政，使全国十九个省份遭了灾荒，约有四千万灾民，缺吃少穿，饥寒交迫，形成普遍物资缺乏供不应求，物价比之战前高出四五千倍。这种外来的物价影响，使我区物资外流，物价上涨很难避免。三、这半年我们管理出入口不严密，可以说几乎是放任自流。解放区的物资，特别是粮食、棉花、土布等大量外流，奢侈品如洋烟、洋酒等大批运进，出入走私现象十分严重，外汇也没有很好的管理，必须品出入兑换上失去平稳，物价因之起了变动。
    造成上述现象除客观原因外，主观上也由于我们对国民党法西斯派的反动阴谋认识不足，对和平估计过高，政治上的麻痹，斗争意志松懈之故。而我们个别部门某些同志，见小不见大，违犯政策制度的行为，亦害事不浅。
    问：物价上涨，对我们是否绝对不利，目前采取何种有效办法可使物价趋于平稳？
    答：物价暴涨暴跌，动荡不稳，对我们是绝对不利的。试看三月以来物价指数，头一期的波动是粮食棉花布匹较快，这虽对整个解放区不算什么，但对于工矿业、小手工业、副业、小本生意及非实物供给制之军政各界，就太不利了。第二时期波动，外来品与粮食棉花并头直上，甚至有超过趋势，这就对我们大大不利。可以说物价暴涨，只有对少数掌握游资投机取巧、囤积居奇者有利，对整个解放区生产建设是不利的。因此我们必须采取平稳的方针，才能克服当前这种物价波动的局面。我们的做法是：
    严格贸易管理禁绝走私  公营商店应该贱买贵卖
    一、加强工商税务管理局机构，严格组织与管理对外贸易，禁止奢侈品外来烟卷、洋油、呢绒等入境，并限制纸张、洋火、颜料进来，禁止粮食、棉花、土布等出境。禁绝走私，不论任何机关团体部门，毫无例外的都须遵守贸易政策和法令，实行外汇管理，以本区出境物资换回我们的必需品。但内地之贸易，则完全是自由的，任何区域或专县，都不能私自实行封锁，以免妨碍物资交流，窒息经济活动。
    二、紧缩通货。在财政上必须注意开源节流，银行须立即停止一切商业贷款，期满者坚决收回，未到期者，可以斟酌情形收回大部或一部，今后贷款应转向工农交通运输等事业上。各级政府工作部门已领未用之经费、事业费须送回财政部门，归入仓库。以后领用经费，须按照审计与会计制度，按月支领，不得预借，以免公财私用。
    三、统一管理机关商店。机关商店除在营业活动中取得部分利润外，更负有调剂物资、平稳物价、巩固本币、安定金融的任务。做法应该是随买随卖，不应该囤积居奇，应该是“贱买贵卖”（即物价贱时我要比市价高点买，物价贵时我要比市价低些卖），不应该是贱不买，贵不卖（贱时我不买，或者比市价低点买，贵时我不卖，或者比市价高点卖），更不应贵买死不卖。须知机关生产之目的，在解决本机关之困难，补助公家之财政不足，以减轻人民负担；如果因我们做法错误，使物价高涨，这不仅不能解决本机关困难，而且将得到相反的结果，这就失去了我们的本意。
    四、调剂物资，改善交通运输，凡属存有食粮、棉花、布匹、食盐之商店，应随时斟酌情形抛出一部或大部以调剂市场。内地的几条经济道路，要赶快修理，减少支差，节省民力畜力，从事运输。群众的运输合作社、运输互助组、运输队等，亦须有计划的组织起来，利用农闲，从事运输事业。
    戎副主席最后坚称：只要大家在认识上一致起来，能贯彻上述四项办法，如果没有意外灾害的话，我区物价是会平稳下去的。
                                                          （语）
