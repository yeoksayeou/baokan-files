Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th: Military news: After occupying the central area of ​​the Central Plains and most of its area, Chiang Kai-shek recently issued another handwritten order, ordering the Chiang troops in the Central Plains to not only use infantry to track and pursue the Li Xiannian's breakthrough troops to prevent them from having the opportunity to "station and lurk," but also specifically ordered the air force to conduct reconnaissance and bombing in separate routes, and prepare to send out tanks to assist in the battle, and must be responsible for "completely annihilating" the CCP's Central Plains troops. Liu Zhi, director of the Kuomintang Zhengzhou Appeasement Office, who directly commands this "encirclement and annihilation" operation, also personally went to the Pinghan front line to command. In recent days, all the breakthrough troops of Li Xiannian's forces have been fiercely pursued by Chiang's troops, and the Central Plains war is still expanding day by day, especially the area west of the Pinghan Railway. Part of Li's troops in the Central Plains, who broke through to the area between Tongbai and Suixian west of the Pinghan Railway, were pursued by parts of Chiang Kai-shek's 41st Army, 15th Army, and 66th Army to the Tianhekou, Gaocheng, and Lishan lines north of Suixian, and were also blocked by part of Chiang Kai-shek's 20th Division. After a fierce battle, they broke through the encirclement and transferred to the vicinity of Zhaoyang. Unexpectedly, in Lutou Town, more than 40 miles northeast of Zhaoyang, they were fiercely attacked by the main force of Chiang's 10th Army. Li's troops had no choice but to cross the Tang and Bai Rivers (tributaries of the Han River, northwest of Zhaoyang) and advance towards Xinyye and Dengxian in southern Henan. When Li's troops crossed the river, the Chiang side sent a large number of twelve aircraft to indiscriminately bomb and strafe. Currently, Chiang Kai-shek's 10th and 15th Armies are still following and pursuing the breakthrough troops, while Chiang's 51st and 47th Armies (this army was originally responsible for clearing operations east of the Pinghan Railway) have rushed to the Nanyang, Zhenping, and Neixiang lines day and night to carry out blocking operations. Another breakthrough force of Li Xiannian's troops, broke through to the area of Yingshan and Anlu west of the Pinghan Railway, and under the pursuit of the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's 66th Army and part of the 75th Army, transferred to the Dahong Mountain area southwest of Suixian, and were again subjected to a fierce "suppression" by Chiang's troops. Part of them had no choice but to cross the Han River from Laohekou and Yicheng, while another part was fighting fiercely with Chiang's troops in the Liushuigou area on the east bank of the Han River north of Zhongxiang. Currently, the main force of Chiang's 66th Army is advancing through Suixian towards Fancheng, attempting to cooperate with the 75th Army to strengthen the blockade of the Han River, Xiangyang, Fancheng to Zhongxiang line, and cut off the breakthrough troops of Li Xiannian's forces on both sides of the Han River, and "annihilate" them separately. On the eastern side of the Pinghan Railway, in addition to transferring two divisions of troops from Fuyang and Anqing to block our scattered and eastward-moving breakthrough troops in the Lihuang and Shangcheng areas, Chiang's troops also mobilized local teams from various counties to "suppress" them on the spot, and fierce fighting is underway.

　　蒋军穷追堵击妄图置我死地
    鄂我军被迫横渡汉水
    一部渡过唐白两河向豫南转进
    【新华社中原某地十五日电】军息：在侵占中原中心地区及其大部地区后，日前蒋介石又再颁手令，命令中原方面蒋军，除以步兵跟踪追击李先念部突围部队不使有“驻足与潜伏”机会外，特别责令空军分路侦察轰炸，并准备出动坦克助战，必须负责将中共中原部队“全部歼灭”。直接指挥这一“围歼”行动之国民党郑州绥署主任刘峙，亦亲赴平汉前线指挥。连日以来，李先念部各路突围部队，均遭蒋军猛烈追击，中原战事仍在日益扩大，尤以平汉路西最为激烈。突围至平汉路西桐柏、随县间之中原李部，一部被蒋介石之四十一军、十五军、六十六军一部追击至随县以北之天河口、高城、厉山一线，又遇蒋介石第二十师一部之堵击，经激烈战斗，始冲出包围，转移至枣阳附近地区。不意在枣阳东北四十余里鹿头镇，又遭蒋之第十军主力猛烈攻击，李部不得已乃抢渡唐、白两河（为汉水支流，枣阳西北），向豫南之新野、邓县一带转进。当李部渡河时，蒋方曾派遣大队飞机十二架，滥肆轰炸扫射。现蒋介石第十军、十五军仍尾随突围部队追击，而蒋之五十一军与四十七军（该军原在平汉路东担任清剿）均已星夜兼程赶至南阳、镇平、内乡一线，进行堵击。李先念部另一突围部队，突围至平汉路西应山、安陆境内，在蒋介石六十六军主力及七十五军一部追击下，转移至随县西南大洪山地区，又遭蒋军猛烈“进剿”，其中一部不得已分别自老河口、宜城方面渡越汉水，另一部则正在钟祥以北汉水东岸渡口流水沟一带与蒋军激战中。现蒋之六十六军主力，正经随县向樊城方面推进，企图配合七十五军加强封锁汉水、襄阳、樊城至钟祥一线，将李先念部突围部队割断于汉水两面，分别予以“围歼”。平汉路东方面，蒋军除自阜阳、安庆增调两师兵力向立煌、商城一带堵击我分散东移突围部队外，又调集各县地方团队就地“堵剿”，正激战中。
