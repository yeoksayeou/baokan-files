　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. Moscow broadcast today that the Shanghai People's Organizations United Federation recently issued a declaration to the American people. Professor Tao Xingzhi, a leader of the China Democratic League, read the declaration at a press conference in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month, which requested the American people not to transport any other raw materials to China except for materials that are beneficial to the Chinese people. Secondly, it expressed doubt as to whether General Marshall's efforts could achieve results. The declaration pointed out: American aid to China has involved the United States in China's long-term civil war, turning the United States' statement of non-interference in China's internal affairs into a dead letter. The Chinese people welcome the United States to assist China's nation-building endeavors, but now that China is in a civil war and there is no nation-building undertaking, every bullet shipped to China by the United States will kill innocent Chinese people. The declaration also stated: According to the opinion of every Chinese with independent and free thought, stopping all American aid to China except for the purpose of benefiting the people is the only way to peacefully resolve the China issue. The continued presence of American troops in China is no longer justified, as the work of withdrawing Japanese troops has come to an end. Of the Japanese troops that should have been withdrawn by the end of June, only 60,000 remain. Since Japan's surrender, the Chinese people have been unwilling to see the troops and Marines of other countries stationed on their territory. The declaration concluded: Until a unified China is established, the people are free from the scourge of war, and the Chinese people have established a democratic, free, and happy government, we will continue to fight for peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 9th. Nanjing dispatch: On the 26th of last month, Long Yun met with a reporter from Dagong Bao in Nanjing and stated: The key to the current situation is the reorganization of the government and the formulation of a constitution. He said that the Yunnan army dispatched 600,000 troops during the War of Resistance. If calculated by population ratio, this is even more than the 2 million troops dispatched by Sichuan. Regarding the 184th Division, which was transferred from Yunnan to the Northeast, announcing an anti-war action, Long explained: This may be because the soldiers are too far from home and are urgently demanding peace.

　　龙云谈称时局关键为改组政府
    【新华社延安九日电】莫斯科今日广播，上海人民团体联合会近发表告美国人民宣言。中国民主同盟领袖陶行知教授，本月二日在上海记者招待会上宣读该宣言，其中要求美国人民，除了运送对中国人民有福利的材料以外，不要运送任何其他原料给中国。其次对于马歇尔将军的努力，是否能达到结果，表示怀疑。宣言指出：美国帮助中国，使美国卷入中国长期内战，使美国不干涉中国内政的声明，变成一纸空文。中国人民欢迎美国协助中国的建国事业，可是现在当中国正在内战，没有任何建国事业时，美国运到中国的每一颗子弹，将打死无辜的中国人。宣言又称：据每一个具有独立自由思想的中国人的意见，停止美国对于中国除为人民目的外的一切帮助，才是和平解决中国问题的唯一方法。美军继续驻在中国已没有任何根据，因为撤退日军工作已告完结。至六月底应该撤退的日军，只留下六万人。从日本投降以后，中国人民不愿再看到在自己领土上驻有其他国家的军队和海军陆战队。宣言结语：当没有建立统一的中国，人民没有摆脱万恶的战争以前，中国人民没有建立起民主自由幸福的政府以前，我们将继续为和平而奋斗。
    【新华社延安九日电】南京讯：上月二十六日龙云在京接见大刚报记者谈称：时局关键为改组政府，及制定宪法。他说云南军队在抗战中曾出兵六十万，如以人口比率计，较四川之出兵二百万犹多。对于自滇调东北之一八四师宣布反战行动，龙氏解释：此或为因士兵离乡过远，而迫切要求和平之故。
