　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: Tehran dispatch: 50,000 Iranian democrats and members of the United Trade Unions demonstrated in Tehran's squares and streets for more than six hours on the afternoon of the 19th. Mass Party Secretary Rostda addressed the demonstrators, stating: All representatives of Iranian workers are gathered here to protest against the British reactionaries' interference in Iranian internal affairs. Rostda called on the masses to hold another demonstration to welcome the General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant. The demonstrating masses passed a resolution opposing the British reactionaries' interference in Iranian internal affairs and the recent shooting of striking workers of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and opposing the Franco regime.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 20th: Local officials here declare that the Iranian government has protested to the British ambassador here regarding the entry of three British cruisers into the Persian Gulf. London sources say: British authorities do not deny the news of British warships entering the Persian Gulf, stating: The mission of the British warships is to "protect British people once they are in danger." It is widely believed that the "danger" referred to by the said authority refers to the movement of Iranian workers of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company against foreign interventionists, a movement that has intensified due to the company authorities shooting workers.

　　伊朗工人游行示威抗议英国干涉内政
    【新华社延安二十日电】德黑兰讯：伊朗民主人士与联合工会会员五万人，十九日下午在德黑兰广场与大街中示威游行六小时以上，群众党书记罗斯达向示威者演说称：所有伊朗工人的代表，皆集合于此，抗议英国反动派干涉伊朗内政。罗氏号召群众举行另一次示威，以欢迎世职联盟总书记赛南。示威群众通过决议，反对英国反动派干涉伊朗内政及最近枪杀英伊石油公司的罢工工人，反对佛朗哥政权。
    【新华社延安二十日电】据法新闻处德黑兰二十日电：此间官方人士宣称：伊朗政府已照会此间英大使，抗议英巡洋舰三艘驶入波斯湾。伦敦消息称：英权威人士不否认英舰驶入波斯湾的消息，称：英舰的任务，在于“当英人一旦受危险的时候，加以保护。”众信该权威人士所称之“危险”，系指英伊油工伊朗工人反对外国干涉者的运动，该运动由于公司当局枪杀工人更形高涨。
