　　Crying for My Uncle Li Gongpu
　　Zhang Zesun
　　The night before last, I suddenly received the news of your murder, and my heart immediately sank. I wanted to cry, but no tears came out. My heart is filled with boundless hatred! I wish I could immediately seize those murderous executioners and subject them to a death of a thousand cuts. I hate that bloodthirsty tyrant who, in order to betray the motherland and establish a fascist dictatorship, has spilled the blood of countless people and patriots under his butcher's knife. And now! His butcher's knife has turned to you. You are not a Communist, you have no gun, and you have no army. You merely used your mouth and deeds to shout out the Chinese people's demand for independence, peace, and democracy! You merely did the basic things that an ordinary Chinese should do. What reason do they have to openly kill you! They can only resort to such the most despicable, shameless, and insidious means – thereby also demonstrating their greatest weakness – to assassinate you. Uncle, when will this deep blood debt be repaid!
　　For the cause of China's independence, peace, and democracy, you fought all your life. You suffered countless persecutions from Chiang Kai-shek, but you never yielded. In November 1936, you were arrested and imprisoned along with Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, and others for organizing the national salvation movement. The whole family was worried about you, especially during the Xi'an Incident. Many rumors said you were in great danger. The family was uneasy, and my aunt and I wanted to see you, but the Kuomintang would not allow visits. It wasn't until the situation eased somewhat that we finally saw you. You said, "What's there to fear? Fight to the end!" And you asked us about the situation of the national salvation movement outside, asking me to find *New Outline of Philosophy*, *Outline of Dialectical Materialism*, and *New Outline of Economics* for you to read. I knew that your body was in the Suzhou detention center, but your heart was still outside! During the two trials in Suzhou, my aunt and I went. Each time, seeing you, Mr. Shen, Mr. Zou Taofen, and others debating with the prosecutor, denouncing the Kuomintang reactionaries for their crimes of civil war and non-resistance against Japan, and calling for "patriotism is not a crime," I was deeply moved by your indomitable spirit of tenacious struggle. We were always worried that something unexpected would happen, but you finally came out of the detention center with the support of the people of the whole country. I always thought that if you could gain freedom in such a critical situation, then nothing more unexpected would happen to you now! But who knew that Chiang Kai-shek, not daring to openly kill you, assassinated you secretly.
　　Under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, how many times has your career been devastated! *Reading Life*, which you put so much effort into, was forced to cease publication. The "Liangcai Tutorial School," which united many professional young people in Shanghai, was established with difficulty under the oppression of the Kuomintang. After the War of Resistance, the "National Communication Agency" you ran was forced to stop. Your active efforts in the democratic movement in the rear also made you more hated by the fascist dictators. When the Jiaochangkou incident occurred, you were finally beaten severely. You and Mr. Tao Xingzhi jointly founded a new type of democratic institution of higher learning, "Social University," in Chongqing, but this school was also intolerable to the fascist dictators and was shut down. And you yourself, in the end, were poisoned by these bestial demons.
　　However, you have also been to another China. In this China, you have seen the light of a new China, and you yourself have been warmly welcomed and helped. In the winter of 1938, you, my aunt, and I went to Yan'an together. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, you delivered speeches and published journals and books under the surveillance and sabotage of Kuomintang agents, but in Yan'an, your speeches on education were widely welcomed. The "Teaching Corps for Resistance and National Reconstruction" that you organized not only freely visited Jinxi Northwest, Jin-Chahar-Hebei, and Taihang, not only freely carried out their work, but also received enthusiastic welcomes everywhere. How different these two Chinas are! Even though you were not a Communist, when I saw you in Taihang in 1940, you could not but admit: "China's hope rests on you, the Communist Party is bound to win." I remember when you left, you repeatedly told me: you are neither a Communist nor a Kuomintang member, and you must use your position as such a middle-of-the-road person to strongly promote the unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. You left with such confidence, and I bid you farewell with the hope of blessing your success, but who knew that this farewell would become a final goodbye!
　　After the Southern Anhui Incident, another anti-Communist upsurge arose within the Kuomintang. At that time, I wrote to you from the Taiyue area, hoping that you, my grandparents, aunt, and younger siblings would all come to the liberated areas. I said: "Life is a little harder, but work is free." However, you were unwilling. You wrote back saying that you had more important work in Kunming. This was the last letter I received from you.
　　This year, in the first month, a telegram came from Yan'an asking if I was still in the Taiyue area. At that time, I was afraid that the letter I wrote would not reach you, and I always wanted to wait until the situation stabilized before writing to you again. As a result, it has been delayed until now. My letter has not been written, and you will never be able to read my letter. "Godfather!" (Let me still use the title you liked to hear the most when I was a child to call you!) I left my parents when I was young and lived with you since I was seven years old. You truly loved me so much. I couldn't afford to study, you provided me with education; I participated in the national salvation movement, you actively supported me; I was expelled from school, you encouraged me in every possible way; I wanted to go to Yan'an, you helped me to go to Yan'an. You not only treated me like this, but you have also helped many young people like this. You loved young people, and young people loved you. But the person loved by the Chinese people is precisely the person hated by Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek concentrated all his hatred on the Chinese people, and therefore, also concentrated it on you. I remember after "December 9th," you jokingly said to me: "You little Communist, don't go too far ahead." Now this "little Communist" is still living and working freely, but you have shed the last drop of blood for the cause of independence, peace, and democracy of the Chinese people. But your blood will not be shed in vain. Blood debts must be repaid with blood. The Chinese people will also concentrate all their hatred on that dictatorial traitor of the people. Your blood will more fiercely ignite the hatred of all the Chinese people. Let the flames of revenge burn everywhere! Today, I swear to your spirit: that day will eventually come. At that time, we must use the blood of these bloodsucking demons to commemorate you and all the martyred predecessors. At that time, the independent, peaceful, and democratic new China that you have longed for day and night will surely appear.

　　哭我的姨父李公朴
    张则孙
    前晚，忽然得到了你遇害的消息，我的心马上就沉下来了。我想哭，但哭不出泪来。我的心里郁积着无限仇恨！我恨不得把那杀人的刽子手立即拿来，千刀万剐。我恨那充满了血腥味的独夫，为了出卖祖国，建立法西斯专政，已不知有多少人民，多少志士，在他的屠刀下溅出了鲜血。而现在呢！他的屠刀又转向了你。你不是一个共产党员，你没有枪，也没有军队，你仅仅是用你的嘴和事喊出了中国人民要求独立和平民主的呼声！你仅仅是做了一个普通中国人应做的起码的事情。他们有什么理由公开杀害你呢！他们只能采取这样最卑鄙无耻最阴险、因而也表现了最软弱的手段暗杀了你。姨父，这血海似的深仇，什么时候才能报了呵！
    为了中国的独立和平民主事业，你奋斗了一生，你遭受过蒋介石无数次的迫害，但你始终没有屈服过。一九三六年十一月，你因组织救亡运动而和沈钧儒、邹韬奋等一起被捕入狱。全家人都为你们担心，特别是西安事变时，许多谣言，都说你们很危险，家里放心不下，我和姨母想去见一见你，但国民党又不让接见，一直到时局比较松一些之后，才见到了你。你说：“怕什么，斗就斗到底！”并且反来问我们外面救亡运动的情形，要我给你找新哲学大纲、辩证唯物论教程和新经济学大纲看，我知道，你的身体是在苏州看守所里，而你的心还是在外面啊！在苏州的两次审判，我和姨母都去了，每次，看到你以及沈老先生、邹韬奋先生等和检察官辩论，斥责国民党反动派内战，不抵抗日本的罪行，呼吁“爱国无罪”的时候，我都被你们不屈不挠的顽强斗争精神所深深激动了，我们一直担心着会发生意外，然而，你却终于在全国人民的声援下，从看守所里出来了。我总想，在那样危急的情况下，你还能得到自由，那么现在，你总不致于发生更意外的事吧！但谁知蒋介石不敢公开地杀你却把你暗杀了。
    在蒋介石的统治下，你的事业曾经受到过多少次的摧残啊！你花了很多心血经营的《读书生活》是被迫停刊的，曾在上海团结了不少职业青年的“量才补习学校”是在国民党的压迫下挣扎着办起来的。抗战后，你办的“全民通讯社”是被迫停止的，你积极努力于大后方的民主运动也正因此，你就更加遭到法西斯独裁者的忌恨，到较场口事件发生，你终于被毒打了。你和陶行知先生共同在重庆创办了一个新型的民主的学府“社会大学”，但这个学校也不容于法西斯独裁者，而被查封了，你自己呢，你自己最后也竟被这兽性的魔鬼毒害了。
    然而，你也曾到过另一个中国，在这一个中国里，你曾经见到了新生中国的光明，你自己也曾受到热诚的欢迎和帮助。一九三八年的冬天，你，姨母和我一起到了延安。在国民党统治区，你是在国民党特务的监视捣乱下发表演说，出版刊物书籍的，但在延安，你的关于教育的演说却受到了普遍的欢迎。你组织的“抗战建国教学团”不但自由地参观了晋西北、晋察冀和太行，不但自由地进行了工作，而且还到处受到热烈的欢迎。这两个中国是多么的不同啊！尽管你不是共产党员，但在一九四○年在太行见到你时，你也不能不承认：“中国的希望就寄托在你们身上，共产党是一定会胜利的。”记得你临走时还对我再三说：你不是共产党，也不是国民党，你一定要以这样的中间人士的地位力促国共两党的团结。你带着这样的信心走了，我也怀着祝福你成功的希望送别了你，但谁知这一别竟成了永别呢！
    皖南事变后，国民党的又一次反共高潮起来了，那时，我从太岳区写信给你，希望你，外祖父、母、姨母和弟妹等一齐到解放区来，我说：“生活是苦一些，但工作却是自由的。”然而，你不愿意，你来信说在昆明你还有更重要的工作，这是我接到你的最后的一封信。
    今年正月时延安来电，说你问我是否还在太岳区，当时我因为怕写的信到不了你手里，总想等局势稳定一些，再给你去信，结果迁延至今，我的信没有写出，而你竟永远读不到我的信了。“干爹！”（让我还是用小时候，你最喜欢听的称呼，称呼你吧！）我从小就离开了父母，七岁起就和你在一起生活，你是那样真正地爱我，我念不起书，你供给我念书；我参加救亡运动，你积极地赞助我，我被学校开除了，你又多方鼓励我，我要到延安，你就帮助我到延安。你不但对我这样，你也曾这样地帮助过好多青年，你热爱着青年，青年也爱戴着你。但是中国人民所爱的人，正是蒋介石所恨的人。蒋介石把所有的仇恨都集中在中国人的身上，因此，也就集中在你的身上。记得“一二九”以后，你曾经对我开玩笑地说：“你这个小共产，不要太走到前面去了。”现在这个“小共产”还在自由地生活着工作着，而你，却为中国人民独立和平民主的事业流尽了最后的一滴血。但你的血是不会白流的，血账还得用血来还。中国人民也会把所有的仇恨都集中在那独夫民贼的身上。你的鲜血将更炽烈地燃烧起全中国人民的仇恨，让复仇的火焰到处燃烧起来吧！今天我对着你的亡灵宣誓：那一天总会到来的，那时，我们一定要用这些吸血魔王的鲜血来祭奠你和所有牺牲的先烈；那时，你所朝夕期望的独立和平民主的新中国一定就会出现。
                                                七月十九日
