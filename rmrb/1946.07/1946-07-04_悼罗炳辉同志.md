In Memory of Comrade Luo Binghui
    Qian Junrui

Last night, upon hearing the news of Comrade Luo Binghui's passing on the 21st, I was stunned and speechless. Following Comrades Ruofei, Bogu, Xiyi, and Deng Fa, another revolutionary star has fallen today. This is truly a great loss for the Chinese people!

Almost every foreign journalist I met would eagerly inquire about General Luo, the world-renowned and exceptionally robust figure, with their impressions of him partly drawn from Edgar Snow's "Red Star Over China." Every foreign journalist who had met him would tell you, "General Luo is a true soldier, a true Chinese soldier." They would often particularly praise his marvelous marksmanship: "He is indeed a sharpshooter with unfailing accuracy." They extolled his military achievements and resourcefulness. At times, they would also tell you, "General Luo is a wonderful storyteller, narrating in such a captivating manner."

Those who truly knew Comrade Binghui would first and foremost feel keenly that he was truly a son of the Chinese people. His love for the people surpassed even his love for his own mother. The people of Huainan, regardless of gender or age, all knew Commander Luo. Commander Luo's arrival in a village or hamlet brought the greatest joy and highest honor to that village or hamlet. He was always followed by a large crowd, especially children. The reactionaries spread rumors that "Commander Luo eats a child every day." Yet, the children adored him, each regarding him as their own grandfather. In many photographs, he is seen holding five or six children, with two or three sitting on his arms, truly resembling a Buddha. In his garrison, if you wanted to understand the local residents' situation and hardships, you would first ask him, and he would tell you everything in detail, naming names. He also unreservedly criticized the shortcomings of his own troops in front of the people, urging them to closely supervise his troops.

Comrade Binghui also deeply loved his soldiers; he was the most respected commander among them. He was deeply concerned about the soldiers' lives, personally inspecting the mess halls. He often said, "The meals must be good, comrades must eat well to win battles." For the soldiers' cultural and recreational life, he personally composed several military songs, which were thoroughly familiar to all soldiers of the New Fourth Army's Second Division. On the front lines, the soldiers had complete confidence whenever they saw Commander Luo's figure: "We will definitely win the battle!" The soldiers' nickname for him was "The Ever-Victorious General Zhao Zilong!"

Comrade Binghui was adept at absorbing profound wisdom from the spontaneous creativity of the masses. In 1941, drawing from his numerous struggles against the enemy, he created his famous "sparrow warfare" tactics. Based on his long experience, he also developed a unique and effective set of training methods. He was skilled at learning from the masses and soldiers. During the Huainan Heroes Conference in 1944, he was very close to a thirteen-year-old sharpshooter, a young mute boy, and discussed matters with him for several hours. He learned farming and animal husbandry from labor heroes Zhang Xingdao and Luo Yun. He learned to use a Mauser pistol with one hand from a reconnaissance hero.

Comrade Binghui was a famous large man, weighing over 220 pounds. It goes without saying that his movements were not very convenient. However, if you visited his home, he would bring out a large pile of tomatoes, pumpkins, and watermelons that he had personally grown for you to taste. Whenever he had free time, he would go to the fields to remove pests, weed, and prune. The tomatoes he produced the year before weighed up to one and a half pounds each, winning first prize in the Central China Production Exhibition. His garrison frequently moved, but as soon as he arrived, the surrounding land would be tilled, and seeds would be sown. He loved raising chickens and was good at it. In recent years, Comrade Binghui's health had not been good; he should have had a long rest. In February of this year, he had an opportunity to go to Beiping for treatment and then to Yan'an for rest, but work and combat prevented him from doing so. The reactionaries continued to create and escalate the civil war, troubling our Comrade Binghui, and ultimately taking his life!

Now Comrade Binghui has left us forever. I believe that his death will inspire millions of soldiers to become superb Binghui marksmen and Binghui-style combat heroes. Our comrades throughout the army will use Luo Binghui's glorious name as a powerful inspiration and encouragement to create various glorious achievements for our people's army.

Behind the news of Comrade Binghui's death, we can hear the despicable and gleeful sneers of the reactionaries. But let the reactionaries listen: for every Luo Binghui who dies in the people's army led by the Communist Party, out of love for the people and hatred for the people's enemies, and due to the people's immense creativity, hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of Luo Binghuis will inevitably emerge. Just wait and see who will laugh the final laugh of victory!

### 悼罗炳辉同志

　　悼罗炳辉同志
    钱俊瑞
    昨晚听见了罗炳辉同志于二十一日病逝的消息，我当时就楞住了，简直讲不出话来。继若飞、博古、希夷、邓发诸同志之后，今天又是一颗革命巨星殒落了。这真是中国人民的大损失！
    差不多每个我所会见的外国记者，都会响往的问起这位名震世界的十分魁梧的罗将军，他们关于他的印象，一半来自史诺的西行漫记。每一个会见过他的外国记者，都会告诉你：“罗将军是个真正的军人，是个真正的中国军人。”他们往往特别赞美他的神妙的枪法：“他的确是个百发百中的神枪手”。夸耀他的战功和机智。有时，他们又会告诉你：“罗将军是个十分会讲故事的人，讲得那样娓娓动听。”
    真正认识炳辉同志的人，首先会亲切地感觉到他真是中国人民的儿子。他热爱人民胜过爱他自己的母亲。淮南的老百姓，不问男女老少，那一个不知道罗司令。罗司令到一庄到一村，便是那一庄一村的最大喜悦和最高的光荣。在他的背后总有一大群的人，特别是小孩。反动派造谣说：“罗司令每天要吃一个小孩子”。可是偏偏小孩子顶喜爱他，个个当他是自己的亲爷爷。他在很多的照片上，抱着五六个小孩，臂膀上坐着两三个，看去真像一个弥陀佛。在他的驻地，说要想了解当地居民的情况和疾苦，你得先问问他，他准会一五一十说名道姓地告诉你。他也毫不避讳地在老百姓面前批评自己队伍的缺点，他要求老百姓要好好监督他的队伍。
    炳辉同志又热爱他的战士，他是战士们最敬爱的司令员。他顶关心战士的生活，亲自到连队上去检查伙食。他常常说：“伙食要搞好，要叫同志们吃的好，才能打胜仗。”为了战士的文化娱乐生活，曾亲自编过几首军歌，新四军第二师全体战士都唱的很烂熟。在火线上，战士们只要看见罗司令的影子，就有十足的把握：“我们一定打胜仗”：战士们给他的称呼是：“常胜将军赵子龙”！
    炳辉同志善于从群众自发的创造中，吸取高度的智慧，一九四一年他从历次对敌斗争中，创造他有名的麻雀战术，凭着他长期的经验，他曾创造出一套独特有效的练兵方法。他善于向群众和战士们学习，一九四四年淮南举行群英大会时，他同一个十三岁的神枪手小哑巴非常亲昵，讨论了好几小时。他向劳动英雄张性道，骆云学习种地、喂牲畜。他从一个侦察英雄那里学会一只手使用驳壳枪。
    炳辉同志是一个出名的大胖子，身重二百二十多磅，不问可知，他的行动是不甚方便的，但是只要你到他家里去玩，他就可以拿出一大堆他所亲自种出来的大蕃茄、大南瓜、大西瓜，给你尝新鲜。他一有空，就到地里去除虫、拔草、剪枝，他前年生产的蕃茄，重的一个有一斤半重，在华中首屈一指中生产展览会中，得过头奖。他的驻地经常移动，但他一到，驻地周围的地，就给翻起来了，种子就给撒下去了。他很爱养鸡，也会养鸡，这几年来，炳辉同志的身体，一直不大好，他早该有长期的休息，今年二月间，他本来有个机会到北平治疗，再到延安来休息，但是工作与战斗不让他这样做，反动派还不断制造和扩大内战来困扰我们的炳辉同志，最后竟夺了他的生命！
    现在炳辉同志与我们永别了，我相信他的死，将号召千千万万的战士。成为超等的炳辉射击手，成为炳辉式的战斗英雄。我们全军的同志，将以罗炳辉这一光辉的名字作为强有力的启示和鼓励，创造出我们人民军队的各种各色的光荣业迹来。
    在炳辉同志去世的消息后面，我们可以听得到反动派幸灾乐祸的极端可耻的狞笑。但反动派听着在共产党领导的人民的军队里死了一个罗炳辉，由于对人民的爱和对人民敌人的憎，并由于人民伟大无比的创造力，必然会产生几百几千甚至几万个罗炳辉，且等着瞧，究竟谁能笑最后的胜利的笑！
