Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th: Through the education and assistance of the democratic government, in Chahar, northern Shanxi and other places, up to now, 120,000 smokers have escaped the sea of misery, accounting for more than 32% of the total number of smokers. These areas were formerly famous opium planting areas of Mengjiang. According to incomplete statistics from 1940 to 1945, the area under opium poppy cultivation in 24 counties reached more than 5 million mu, and the number of drug addicts exceeded 330,000, accounting for about 13.3% of the total population, resulting in a sharp reduction in arable land and agricultural labor. After liberation, the democratic government immediately led a large-scale anti-smoking campaign, establishing anti-smoking hospitals in various towns and anti-smoking centers in rural areas. For example, in the fifth district of Guoxian County, northern Shanxi, 274 smokers were gathered, and they elected anti-smoking activists to lead them. After more than a month, all of them quit their addiction. In Huai Ren village, more than 60 smokers, after being persuaded by the village security officer Ma Yongfu to mobilize workers and the masses, were all reformed and participated in production.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 21st: The prison here has become a busy and happy place for labor and learning. Inside, there are more than ten kinds of production cooperatives, such as shoe making, livestock raising, and tofu making. Every prisoner participates in one or more types of production according to his physical strength and interests. The production income is entirely distributed to the prisoners as dividends according to their labor performance and other conditions. In the month with the best production performance, more than 350 jin of millet were distributed. When a prisoner's father came to visit, he found that his son had quit opium and took more than 2,000 yuan home with him when he left, deeply thanking the democratic government for its good governance. Another poor prisoner, Zhang Chunlin, worked hard in production and received more than 200 jin of millet in May, all of which he entrusted to someone to take home. Many prisoners have become diligent and good citizens after being released from prison.

　　察哈尔晋北各地
    十二万烟民脱离苦海
    承德监狱变成学校
    【新华社张家口十八日电】经过民主政府教育帮助，察哈尔、晋北等地，迄今已有十二万烟民脱离苦海，约占烟民总数百分之三十二强。上述地区，过去原为著名的蒙疆鸦片种植区，据一九四○年至四五年不完全统计，该区二十四县种植之烟粟，竟达五百余万亩，吸毒人数三十三万余名，约占总人口数百分之十三点三。致使农作物耕植物劳动力之锐减。解放后民主政府即领导开展大规模戒烟运动，于各城镇举办戒烟病院，农村中则普设戒烟所，如晋北崞县五区各村，曾集中烟民二百七十四人，由他们推选戒烟积极分子领导，经月余时间，全数戒绝烟瘾。怀仁村六十余烟民，经该村治安员马永福发动工人群众规劝，全部改造参加生产。
    【新华社承德二十一日电】此间监狱已成为一座紧张愉快的劳动学习场所。内部共设有制鞋、养家畜、作豆腐等十多种生产合作社。每一犯人都根据自己的体力与兴趣参加了一种以上的生产。生产收入，根据劳动成绩等条件，悉数作为红利，发给犯人。生产成绩最好的月份，分了三百五十多斤小米。犯人的父亲来探视时，发现儿子大烟已戒，临走还带了二千多元回家，深深感谢民主政府的善政。另一贫苦犯人张春林，辛勤生产，五月份分得二百多斤小米，全部托人捎回家去，许多犯人出狱后，都变成勤劳的好公民。
