Ironclad Facts Are Plain for All to See, Reckless Lies Only Increase Shame

    The spokesman then solemnly stated: We have consistently opposed the undemocratic nature and Kuomintang monopoly of the UNRRA administration. We have repeatedly requested the reorganization of the UNRRA administration and its branches in various places to include representatives from the Liberated Areas, or to recognize the relief sub-committees in the Liberated Areas as branches, or to jointly establish offices, but all to no avail. The Chiang Kai-shek government still insists on its monopoly policy. Regarding the unfair distribution of relief supplies, we have submitted our opinions to UNRRA and the UNRRA administration twice, on April 17th and June 19th of this year. Chiang’s statement that "the Communist Party has never expressed dissatisfaction" is also inconsistent with the facts. As for transporting this extremely small amount of supplies to the Liberated Areas, the situation is not as Chiang stated, "It is extremely difficult to carry out relief in the Communist-controlled areas," but rather the Kuomintang authorities have created numerous obstacles and even detained the supplies. For example, the "relief supplies" destined for Chengde were detained twice on the Pinggu line; the medical equipment of the Soong Ching Ling Welfare Foundation for assisting the Suwan Peace Hospital was detained in Zhenjiang; the relief supplies destined for Taihang were detained in Qin County; the Jinan authorities confiscated equipment and materials of our Yellow River levee repair personnel, etc.; Yan Xishan actually only controls a very small number of counties in Shanxi, but he falsely claimed to represent all 105 counties in the province to receive supplies. Due to the above-mentioned facts, the man-made political difficulties in transporting supplies to the Liberated Areas have been created.

    The spokesman refuted Chiang’s claim that "…the code is unclear…" All industrial and agricultural equipment and materials of various kinds transported to China by UNRRA are urgently needed by the Liberated Areas because these areas have suffered the greatest war damage, and the people have every right to enjoy these relief supplies. Today, the vast people and governments of the Liberated Areas are actively engaged in effective reconstruction and rehabilitation work. Here, there is a need to improve agriculture and start industries. Here, there are railways, highways, rivers, and coasts. Therefore, this item of supplies must not be allowed to be swallowed into the private pockets of Kuomintang bureaucrats and used as tools for civil war. Chiang also said: "The areas controlled by the Communist army are grain-producing areas with good harvests," which seems to be another excuse for not distributing relief supplies. We believe that the reason why the Liberated Areas are not like the Kuomintang-controlled areas, where the land is barren for thousands of miles and the roads are littered with corpses of the starving, is due to the excellent political system and high work efficiency. Therefore, this is the result of the people's efforts, but it does not mean that the Liberated Areas have no difficulties and disasters, or do not need relief. If UNRRA relief supplies are to be effective, they should be distributed to these areas that need relief and are truly working hard on relief.

    The spokesman finally stated: We insist on reorganizing the UNRRA administration to include representatives from the Liberated Areas, eliminate corruption, and not use relief supplies as capital for civil war. Relief should be distributed fairly and selflessly according to the proportion of disaster-stricken areas and population. Using relief supplies as a selfish and self-serving political tool, using relief supplies to prolong and expand the civil war, causing post-war China, which urgently needs reconstruction, to suffer disaster upon disaster, and causing tens of millions of compatriots on the verge of starvation to not only fail to enjoy the benefits of "relief" but also suffer the misfortune of "relief," is extremely shameful and inhumane! We reiterate: We are extremely dissatisfied and intolerable with the work of the Chiang government's relief agency, the "UNRRA administration"! We hope that due to the frank appeals and efforts of UNRRA personnel in China, the attention of the relief authorities and international people committed to relief can be aroused, and the Kuomintang government's corrupt practices of embezzlement and unfair distribution of relief supplies can be quickly corrected.

    铁的事实有目共睹  信口胡说徒增羞耻
    该发言人继即郑重表示：我方一贯反对行总机构之不民主与一党包办，曾屡次要求改组行总及在各地之分署，吸收解放区代表参加，或承认各解放区救济分会为分署，或合组办事处，但均无结果，蒋介石政府仍坚持包办方针。关于分配救济物资之不公平事实，我方曾于今年四月十七日及六月十九日，两次向联总、行总提出意见，蒋氏说“共党从来未表示不满”，亦属不合事实。至于说到运送此极少量物资至解放区，情形并不是如蒋氏所言“在共军区域办理救济极为不易”，而是国民党当局的多方留难，甚至扣留，如运往承德之“救济物资”，在平古一线曾遭两次扣留；如中国福利基金委员会扶助苏皖和平医院的医药器材，被扣于镇江；如运往太行之救济物资，被扣于沁县；如济南当局没收我黄河复堤人员器材等；如阎锡山实际只统治山西极少县份，但竟假借全省一零五县名义，领取物资。由于以上种种事实，乃造成运至解放区物资人为的政治的困难。
    发言人驳斥蒋氏所称：“……电码不明……”所有联总运华之工业农业设备及各科器材，均为解放区所急需，因为这些地区遭受战争之破坏最大，人民完全有权享受此等救济物资。今日广大解放区人民与政府，正积极从事有效的重建恢复工作，这里需要改良农业与开办工业，这里有铁路、公路、河道与海岸，故该项物资决不允许国民党大官僚吞入私囊，及作内战工具。蒋氏又说：“共军控制区均为产粮之地，收成尚佳”，似乎这又是不分配救济物资的借口。我们认为解放区所以不像国民党统治区赤地千里，饿莩载道，是由于优良的政治制度，与高度的工作效率，所以这是人民努力的成效，但并不等于解放区没有困难和灾荒，或不需要救济。联总救济物资如果要获得实效，正应该分配给这些需要救济并真正努力救济的区域。
    发言人最后表示：我们坚持改组行总机构，吸取解放区代表参加，杜绝贪污，并不得以救济物资充作内战资本，应按受灾地区与人口比例，实行公平无私的分配。用救济物资作自私自利的政治工具，利用救济物资延长和扩大内战，使战后急需重建的中国，灾上加灾，使数千万饥饿线上的同胞，不但未蒙“救济”之福，而且反遭“救济”之祸，是极端可耻和不人道的事！我们再度声明：对于蒋政府救济机关“行总”的工作，是极端不满和难于容忍的！我们希望由于联总在华人员坦直的呼吁和努力，能引起救署当局和国际努力救济事业人士的注意，迅速纠正国民党政府对救济物资的贪污中饱，和不公平分配的恶劣现象。
