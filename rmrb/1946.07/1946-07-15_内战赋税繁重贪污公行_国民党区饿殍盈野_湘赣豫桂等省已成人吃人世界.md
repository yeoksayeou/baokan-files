Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th—Summer harvest is approaching, but the famine in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is worsening. The number of disaster victims in Hunan Province has reached 30 million, of which more than 15 million have been surviving on grain husks, grass roots, tree bark, and "Guanyin earth" for several months. In many places, even grass roots and tree bark have been eaten, and many people are fleeing the famine. In the Lingling area of Hunan, "human oil companies" have emerged, and the tragedy of cannibalism has become common in Hunan.

The number of famine victims in Henan has increased from 8.2 million in May to over 14.2 million recently. Currently, in the eastern part of Henan, starving people are everywhere, emaciated and with bellies swollen like drums. Many famine victims are forced to sell their daughters and wives, who are trafficked to Xuzhou, Yangzhou, and other areas to become prostitutes, leading to a surge in brothels in Henan cities.

Jiangxi has 13 million refugees, and the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration estimates there are over 9 million, accounting for 70% of the province's population. Even formerly wealthy farmers have gone bankrupt. The population of Wuning has decreased from 150,000 to 100,000. Between Cihua and Hexiang, eyewitnesses found as many as six corpses of people who had starved to death in a village with fewer than seven households. The situations in Yichun, Pingxiang, Wanzai, and Fenyi counties are similar.

In Guangxi Province, 13 million out of the total population of 14 million are suffering from hunger. As early as May, 3 million people were already waiting to die from starvation. At the beginning of this month, the price of rice in Guilin City exceeded 70,000 yuan, and starving people and abandoned babies were frequently found in the city. In Lingui County, the number of famine victims dying of starvation is increasing daily, and the "human market" is gradually becoming unsustainable. Some time ago, an American woman could be sold for a shi of grain, but now many famine victims are willing to give their children away to others without any compensation.

Large areas of land have been abandoned. In Henan, over 37 million mu of arable land were left uncultivated last year and this spring, accounting for a quarter of the total arable land. However, last year's grain production was only over 80 million shi, a decrease of three-quarters compared to pre-war production, proving that production has been severely damaged. This spring, wind disasters were widespread in more than 40 counties in Henan, and the harvests of beans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains were generally below 30%. In Jiangxi, 65% of the land, approximately 28 million mu, has been abandoned, often with no signs of human habitation for tens or hundreds of miles. In Anhui, 30% of the total land, approximately 21 million mu, has been abandoned. In Hunan, along the lakes, the Li River, the Xiang River, the Yuehan Railway, and the Qian-Gui Railway, much of the land is left uncultivated. Large areas of land have also been abandoned in Guangdong and Guangxi.

Heavy war taxes, forced grain requisitions by the army, and corruption and extortion by officials are the direct and main factors contributing to the continuing and severe famine. Farmers in Henan have to supply 800,000 to 1 million troops for the Kuomintang's civil war. Even Liu Maoen, the chairman of Henan Province, recently admitted that the burden on the people of Henan is now heavier than during the War of Resistance. The fact that the army cannot be demobilized is the main reason for the current heavy burden on the people. In Fengqiu County alone, from the Japanese surrender to April this year, 2.8 million jin of grain, 1.2 million yuan in legal tender, 92,000 chi of native cloth, 9,600 jin of cotton, and 12,000 pairs of military shoes and socks have been requisitioned. In Yanjin, each person has to bear more than two shi of grain in less than half a year. Therefore, people are forced to defend themselves or flee with their families. Even bao and jia heads are committing suicide because they cannot collect enough grain. For example, Wu Chao'an, the jia head of Huangluji in Fengqiu County, and two others committed suicide by jumping into a well, Huang Zenggao, the bao head of Haozhai, hanged himself, and Li Tianjun, the jia head of the fifth jia of the ninth bao of Shizhong Township in Xin'an County, committed suicide because they could not complete the grain requisition task.

Hunan is the province with the most severe famine in the country, but former Provincial Chairman Wu Shaofu insisted until his departure that military grain could not be exempted and had to be paid quickly. The new Chairman, Wang Dongyuan, claimed to be there to provide disaster relief, but what about military grain? It still had to be paid, and with utmost urgency. In Guangxi, where famine victims are everywhere, 3 million shi of military grain are still being urgently collected within a limited time. The Guangxi Daily admitted: "The damage to agriculture caused by our own poor political economy and personnel mismanagement is no less than the direct impact of enemy destruction and war (referring to the War of Resistance)." Now, disregarding the opposition of the people of the whole country, the Kuomintang authorities have implemented the collection of land tax in kind and the borrowing of military grain since January of this year. This is tantamount to adding fuel to the fire, and will force the people to death!

### 内战赋税繁重贪污公行  国民党区饿殍盈野  湘赣豫桂等省已成人吃人世界

　　内战赋税繁重贪污公行
　  国民党区饿殍盈野
　　湘赣豫桂等省已成人吃人世界
    【新华社延安十二日电】夏收已届，但国民党统治区各地灾荒却在严重发展中。湖南全省灾民已达三千万，其中一千五百万人以上，数月来即以谷糠、草根、树皮及观音土延续生命。且在许多地方，连草根树皮也吃光了，于是许多的人向外逃荒。湖南零陆一带，出现了人油公司，而人吃人的惨剧，在湖南已屡见不鲜。
    河南饥民数目，已自五月间的八百二十万，增至最近的一千四百二十余万。目前豫东一带，饥民载道骨瘦如柴，肚皮膨胀如鼓。许多饥民被迫将自己的生女爱妻出卖，被贩到徐州、扬州一带当妓女，而河南城市窑子特为发达。
    江西难民达一千三百万，联总估计亦有九百余万，为全省人数百分之七十，昔日富农也已破产。武宁人口已自十五万减为十万，慈化到荷乡中途，一个不满七户的村庄，目击者即发现饿殍六具之多。宜春、萍乡、万载、分宜各县情形，均与此相类。
    广西全省一千四百万人口中，一千三百万受饥。其中早在五月即有三百万人绝粮待毙。本月初，桂林市米价涨过七万元，市内饿殍弃婴时有发现。临桂县属饥民饿毙者日增，“人市场”也渐渐维持不住了。前些时，美女子一人，卖价一石谷子，现在则许多饥民都情愿无代价的将亲生儿女送给别人。
    土地是大量荒芜了，河南上年及今春荒废耕地三千七百多万亩，为全数耕地四分之一，但上年粮食产量仅八千余万石，比战前产量减少四分之三，证明生产已极度被破坏了。今春风灾普遍河南四十余县，豆、麦、杂粮收成普遍的在三成以下。江西土地之荒芜，达全数百分之六十五，即约为二千八百万亩，往往有十里、数百里渺无人迹。安徽全部土地有百分之三十，即约二千一百万亩告荒。湖南则滨湖、澧水、湘江、粤汉路、黔桂路一带，田地多无人耕种。两广亦有大量田地荒芜。
    内战赋税的繁重，军队的催征，官吏的贪污敲诈，是饥荒继续剧烈的直接主要因素。河南农民要供应国民党内战军队八十万至一百万人，连豫省主席刘茂恩最近也承认河南老百姓的负担已比抗战时更重了。军队都不能复员，这是目前人民负担沉重的主要症结。只封邱一个乡，自日本投降到今年四月，就已被征派粮食二百八十万斤，法币一百二十万元，土布九万二千尺，棉花九千六百斤，军鞋、军袜一万二千双。延津则不到半年，每人就要负担粮食两石以上。因此老百姓被迫自卫，或举家逃亡的，比比都是，甚至保甲长也以无法征足粮食，只好自杀。如封邱县黄陆集甲长吴朝安等三人投井自杀，蒿寨保长黄增高上吊，新安县石中乡第九保第五甲甲长李天俊自杀，就是因为无法完成征粮任务。
    湖南灾荒甲全国，但前省主席吴少佛直到去任时还口口声声说，军粮不能免，而且得快缴。新主席王东原自己说是为救灾，然而军粮呢？仍得缴，而且急如星火。广西饥民遍地，三百万石的军粮还在急令限期追缴。广西日报承认：“我们自己政治经济的不良，人事的失调所加给农业的打击，不下于敌人的破坏与战争（指抗战）的直接影响”。现在不顾全国人民的反对，国民党当局又自本年一月起，实行田赋征实，军粮征借，这无异火上加油，要活活的逼死老百姓！
