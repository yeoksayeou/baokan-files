　　[Telegram from Handan, 18th] Just as people from all walks of life in the Border Region were overwhelmed with grief and indignation over the assassination of Mr. Li Gongpu by Kuomintang secret agents, news arrived that Mr. Wen Yiduo had also been murdered, arousing extreme fury. People have been sending telegrams to the Wen family and Mr. Wen Lihe to express their deepest condolences. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Border Region Government, stated in his telegram: "We firmly believe that the blood of martyrs will surely water the brilliant flowers of revolution!" Xing Zhaotang, Deputy Speaker of the Border Region Assembly, pointed out in his condolence message: "The successive assassinations of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen by Kuomintang secret agents mark the beginning of a new 'reign of terror' by the Kuomintang fascists in their controlled areas. They kill one after another; we must unite like steel to stop this atrocity. The people of the Border Region pledge to be the rear guard for the democratic movement in the Great Rear Area." Fan Wenlan, President of Northern University, wrote: "Chiang Kai-shek's open slaughter of professors and scholars is even more brutal and shameless than any tyrant or dictator in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. All of us in the educational and academic circles of the country must rise up together to stop this atrocity." Sun Wenshu, a leader in the women's movement, said in her condolence message: "The deaths of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen have further deepened the responsibilities of us who are still living." Telegrams from the Federation of Cultural Circles and the Journalists' Association pointedly stated: "After the murder of Mr. Li and Mr. Wen, the Kuomintang's Central Propaganda Department spokesman, covering his ears while stealing a bell, claimed to be 'apprehending the murderers,' but the people of the whole country know clearly that the murderers are precisely the fascist secret service group headed by Chiang Kai-shek. They have killed one Wen Yiduo and one Li Gongpu, but there will surely be thousands of Wen Yiduos and Li Gongpus following in their bloody footsteps to fight to the end for independence, democracy, and peace."
