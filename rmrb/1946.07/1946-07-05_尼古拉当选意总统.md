This time, he was unanimously elected as president by the three major Italian parties—the Christian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party.

    【新华社延安三十日电】罗马讯：意大利立宪议会于八日下午选出享恩理科尼古拉为意大利共和国临时大总统。尼古拉氏现年六十八岁，原属自由党，于一九二一年退出，曾任意国会议长，为意国有名的评论律师。此次由意三大政党——基督教民主党、社会党、共产国一致协议选为总统。据路透社电称：“乃因为他是南党人，对团结帝制派占优势的南意于新共和国周围，极为可贵”。
