Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 9th: More than a week has passed since the Kuomintang authorities issued a statement through Peng Xuepei on June 30th (the last day of the extended ceasefire order). The domestic situation has not only failed to ease, but the Kuomintang reactionaries' civil war plan is gradually unfolding across the country.

	In the Central Plains: The Kuomintang is besieging one division of our Central Plains troops with nine armies, twenty-one divisions, and more than two hundred thousand men. After occupying Xuanhuaidian, the central area of the Central Plains Military Region, they are using the main force of the 72nd Army, the 174th Division of the 48th Army, parts of the 18th and 47th Armies, and local militias to "suppress" the liberated areas east of the Pinghan Railway. Simultaneously, they are using the main force of the 41st Army, the 15th Army, the 20th Division of the 10th Army, and the 66th Army to besiege our troops breaking through to the west of the Pinghan Railway, actively forming a new encirclement of over one hundred thousand men in the area between Suixian and Zhaoyang, continuing to implement "annihilation" against our army.

	In Shandong: In addition to the 54th Army and 73rd Army arriving in Jinan by sea and air, the designation of the Independent 10th Division has recently appeared. Currently, the Kuomintang forces concentrated in the Shandong area consist of four armies and one independent division, namely the 74th Army in Qingdao, the 96th Army and 73rd Army in Jinan, the 8th Army and Independent 10th Division in Rizhao and Weixian. Starting in early June, they launched operations from the east, west, and central directions, attempting to clear the Jiaoji Railway to further expand the civil war in Shandong. They have successively occupied Mingshui, Zhangqiu, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, and Jimo in our liberated areas, and at one point occupied Yidu and Linzi. The fighting there is still intense.

	In Shanxi: Two divisions of Hu Zongnan's 47th Army forcibly crossed the Yellow River from Dayangdu near Shanzhou on the 3rd and 4th of this month, occupying Maojindu, an important crossing in southern Shanxi. Cooperating with Kuomintang forces attacking south from Anyi and Yuncheng along the Tongpu Railway, they occupied Zhangdian, a major town south of Xia County, seizing the entire Zhangdian-Maojindu highway and are expanding the war towards Wenxi and Anyi. Yan Xishan in central Shanxi is attacking the Pingchuan liberated area, occupying Wenshui and Jiaocheng. After occupying more than 100 villages and towns including Kaizha Town, Xiaoyi Town, Dongshe, Xishe, and Wangmingzhai, which belong to Fenyang County, in addition to continuing to invade the Zhongyang and Lishi areas of the southwestern Shanxi liberated area, they have recently concentrated the 42nd, 44th, and 46th Divisions, along with the puppet army of Zhao Rui, and are attacking the Yuci and Taigu areas of the Taihang liberated area in four routes, echoing Hu Zongnan's northern advance.

	In Jiangsu and Anhui: The Kuomintang authorities have concentrated twenty-seven divisions around the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated areas. The number of divisions alone along the northern bank of the ×× middle section has increased to six or seven armies. The deployment has now been completed. The Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense recently ordered a swift end to reorganization and training, actively preparing for combat operations. It also ordered the 3rd Aviation Brigade of Xuzhou to prepare for aerial attacks on Jiangsu and Shandong. Wang Maogong, Gu Zhenggang, and Tang Enbo personally went to Yangzhou and Taizhou to organize so-called "refugee repatriation teams," shouting slogans like "Armed return to northern Jiangsu." Recently, they instigated the secretary of the puppet Legislative Yuan and others to organize a "Brotherhood," staging armed riots in the Gaoyou and Rugao areas. The Nanjing "Central" "Peace" Daily is rushing to print millions of leaflets, preparing for use in the offensive against the Jiangsu-Anhui liberated areas.

	In Hebei, Shandong, and Henan: The Kuomintang authorities continue to attack the eastern Henan liberated area. At the same time, even in a challenging manner, they demand that our army withdraw from Dongming and Kaocheng on the Hebei-Henan border, clearing a path for the Kuomintang army to attack.

	In addition, the Kuomintang army in Rehe is attacking Chengde and Chifeng. Preparations for the civil war in the Northeast have also been completed. Zheng Dongguo and others are inspecting Yongji and other places, preparing to launch an attack at any time. The Kuomintang's planes are reconnoitering and bombing important towns and cities in the liberated areas of Rehe, Chahar, Hebei, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu, indicating the urgency of the civil war situation.

	As for negotiations, the Kuomintang authorities still insist on the unreasonable demands put forward during the ceasefire period. The negotiations on June 2nd yielded no results. On the 3rd, the Kuomintang authorities suddenly unilaterally announced the convening of the National Assembly on November 12th. On the 5th, they again unilaterally formally stated that they would "expand the foundation of the government" before September. On the 8th, Peng Xuepei responded to reporters' questions about the CCP's "July 7th Declaration," reiterating that there could be no comprehensive ceasefire unless the CCP succumbed to the other side's unreasonable demands. Peng also used the Kuomintang authorities' unilateral decision to convene the National Assembly in November to block the CCP and democratic人士' proposals for immediately convening a Political Consultative Conference. The above facts show that the Kuomintang authorities, under new domestic and international conditions, are adopting a method of fighting while talking, with fighting as the main focus, that is, expanding the civil war under the cover of negotiations. During the fifteen-day ceasefire and the eight-day extended ceasefire, the warmongers had already prepared for a full-scale civil war, attempting to threaten the CCP, democratic parties, and the people of the whole country into submission. However, this threat did not succeed. Due to the CCP representatives' sufficient concessions in the negotiations, while adhering to a firm and reasonable attitude in rejecting the other side's unreasonable demands, the strength of the liberated areas' self-defense forces, the rising tide of the anti-civil war movement of patriotism from all strata of society, the warmongers' huge military, political, and economic difficulties, and the general trend of international peace, along with the growing international trend against Chiang Kai-shek and the US authorities' armed intervention, the Kuomintang authorities had no choice but to issue Peng Xuepei's statement, falsely claiming "no military action against the Communist army," to ease opposition from all sides. However, the fact that the Kuomintang authorities have been expanding military offensives against the liberated areas every day for a week has shown that the Kuomintang authorities are actually adopting a policy of fighting while talking, with fighting as the main focus. Recognize this serious crisis, and shatter the warmongers' conspiracy to actively expand the civil war and plunge the people of the whole country into an unprecedented sea of blood!

### 国民党当局在谈判掩护下  加紧扩大全面内战  向我各解放区发动进攻

　　国民党当局在谈判掩护下
　  加紧扩大全面内战
    向我各解放区发动进攻
    【新华社延安九日电】六月三十日（停战令延期最后一天），国民党当局经由彭学沛发表声明，迄今已逾一周，国内形势不但未见缓和，国民党反动派的内战计划且正在全国范围内逐步展开。中原方面：国民党以九个军二十一个师二十余万人，围攻我中原部队一个师。在攻占中原军区中心地区宣化店后，一面以七十二军主力，四十八军一七四师，十八军与四十七军一部，及各地方团队“清剿”平汉线东解放区，一面又以四十一军十五军主力第十军二十师与六十六军，围攻我向平汉路西突围部队，积极在随县、枣阳之间地区，形成十余万人的新的包围圈，继续对我军实施“围歼”。
    山东方面：除五十四军与七十三军由海运空运抵济外，近又出现独立第十师番号。现集中山东地区国民党军共有四个军、一个独立师，计青岛方面之七十四军，济南方面之九十六军七十三军，日照、潍县方面之第八军与独立第十师，六月上旬开始由东、西、中三个方面出动，企图打通胶济路，以便于进一步扩大山东内战，已先后侵占我军解放区之明水、章邱、周村、张店、即墨，并一度占领益都、临淄，该处战事仍在激烈进行中。
    山西方面：胡宗南部四十七军两个师，本月三、四两日由陕州附近之大阳渡强渡黄河，攻占晋南重要渡口茅津渡，并与由同蒲路安邑、运城南犯之国民党军配合，占领夏县以南重镇张店，侵占整个张（店）、茅（津渡）公路，正向闻喜、安邑地区扩大战争。晋中阎锡山正进攻平川解放区，侵占文水、交城，汾阳县属之开栅镇、孝义镇、东社、西社、王明寨等村镇一百余处后，除继续向晋西南解放区中阳、离石地区进犯外，近复集中四十二、四十四、四十六等师，与伪军赵瑞部，分四路向太行解放区榆次、太谷境内进攻，与北上胡军遥相呼应。
    苏皖方面：国民党当局在苏皖解放区周围集中了二十七个师的兵力，仅××中段北岸沿线即增至六、七个军，刻已部署完竣，日前国民党国防部下令迅速结束整训，积极准备作战行动，并命令徐州之航空第三大队准备向苏鲁进行空中攻击，王懋功、谷正纲、汤恩伯曾亲到扬州、泰州组织所谓“难民还乡队”，高喊“武装打回苏北去”的口号，日前并策动伪立法院书记等组织“兄弟会”，在高邮、如皋地区举行武装暴动。南京“中央”“和平”日报，正赶印百万份传单，准备作进攻苏皖解放区之用。
    冀鲁豫方面：国民党当局一面继续进攻豫东解放区，同时，甚至以挑战式之姿态，要求我军退出冀豫边之东明、考城，为国民党军让开一条进攻道路。
    此外热河国民党军正向承德、赤峰进攻。东北内战亦已布置就绪，郑洞国等巡视永吉等地，准备随时发动。而国民党飞机之侦察与轰炸热、察、河北、山东、苏北等解放区重要城镇，亦正表明内战形势之紧急。
    至于谈判方面，国民党当局仍坚持休战时期所提出之无理要求，六月二日谈判毫无结果，三日国民党当局突然单方面宣布在十一月十二日召开国民大会，五日又单方面正式表示要在九月以前“扩大政府基础”，八日彭学沛答复记者关于中共七七宣言的谈话，重申其除非中共屈服于对方无理要求之前，便不能有全面停战。彭氏并以国民党当局单方面决定十一月召集国民大会，来阻挡中共及民主人士关于立即召集政协会议的主张。以上事实说明国民党当局在新的国内外条件下，正在采取边谈边打以打为主的办法，就是说在谈判掩护下扩大内战的方针。在十五天休战和八天延期休战的时候，好战派就早已准备了全面内战，企图威胁中共与民主党派及全国人民屈服。然而这一威胁没有成功，由于中共代表在谈判中，一面作了足够让步，同时坚持严正拒绝对方无理要求的坚定与合理的态度，解放区自卫力量的强大，全国各阶层爱国主义的反内战运动高涨，好战派军事、政治、经济上的巨大困难，以及国际和平局面的总趋势，与国际上反对蒋介石与反对美当局武装干涉的潮流，日渐滋长，国民党当局乃不得不有彭学沛声明，诡称“不对共军采取军事行动”，以缓和各方面的反对。但一周以来，国民党当局天天扩大对解放区军事进攻的事实，已说明国民党当局实际上是采取了边打边谈以打为主的方针。认清这一严重危机，粉碎好战派积极扩大内战把全国人民陷入空前血海的阴谋行动！
