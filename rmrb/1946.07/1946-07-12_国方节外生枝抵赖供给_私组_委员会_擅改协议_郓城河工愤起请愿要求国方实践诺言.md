　　The Kuomintang Raises Obstacles and Denies Supplies
　　Privately Forms "Committee," Unilaterally Alters Agreement
　　Yucheng River Workers Rise Up in Petition, Demanding the Kuomintang Fulfill Promises
    [Our Newspaper Heze Eighth Dispatch] The Kuomintang side is once again creating obstacles and deliberately delaying the allocation of funds for the dike repair project. A portion of the funds allocated from Nanjing to Kaifeng at the end of last month is now being withheld under the pretext that "it must await the decision of the committee" before it can be disbursed. The so-called committee was unilaterally formed on the 26th of last month by the Executive Headquarters, composed of representatives from the Executive Headquarters Henan Branch, the Yellow River Commission, and UNRRA, to be responsible for discussing and determining the standards for the dike repair project and the treatment of workers. This committee does not include representatives from the Liberated Areas, and the issues of project standards and worker treatment were already negotiated and agreed upon by representatives from the Liberated Areas and the Yellow River Commission during the Heze Agreement. This is clearly creating obstacles and deliberately delaying the treatment of workers. The Kuomintang side is shamelessly denying the original regulations, stating that "disbursement can only be made according to the new regulations of the Yellow River Commission." The Liberated Area's dike repair project has already commenced for over a month, and no notice of changes to worker treatment has been received from the Yellow River Commission. Representatives from the Liberated Areas firmly maintain that worker treatment should be disbursed according to the originally stipulated standards announced to the workers, and any future changes must be mutually agreed upon through consultation between both parties. Furthermore, the Kuomintang side verbally notified that once the flour supply is exhausted, public grain will be replaced with soybean flour. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Commission also expressed strong opposition to this.
    [Our Newspaper Heze Eighth Dispatch] Since the commencement of work on June 12th, over 1,000 of the 14,300 dike repair workers in the Yucheng repair section have fallen ill in less than half a month. At the same time, the excavation of soil for dike repair has destroyed over 2,000 mu of green crops. The poor peasants participating in the dike repair have advanced their own work grain and fuel, totaling 758,000 jin of wheat and 1,516,000 jin of firewood. They are now destitute and not only unable to continue dike repair, but their livelihoods are also facing serious difficulties and are becoming unsustainable. They have convened meetings and elected representatives to petition the democratic government, demanding with sorrow and indignation that the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek immediately implement the Nanjing Agreement, and demanding that UNRRA and the Executive Headquarters immediately allocate and transport work grain, wages, medicine, and equipment according to the original regulations, compensate the masses for the grain and firewood they have advanced, in order to maintain the livelihoods of the masses and facilitate the continuation of the project.

　　国方节外生枝抵赖供给
　  私组“委员会”擅改协议
　　郓城河工愤起请愿要求国方实践诺言
    【本报荷泽八日电】国民党方面对复堤工程应拨工款又节外生枝故意拖延，上月底由南京拨至开封之一部工款，今竟又借口“须候委员会决定”始能拨发，所谓委员会系上月二十六日，行总片面指令由行总河南分署黄委会及联总三方代表所组成，负责商定，复堤工程标准及工人待遇等问题。该委员会并无解放区代表参加，且工程标准及工人待遇问题，早在荷泽协议时已由解放区代表会同黄委会代表商定，此显系节外生枝，故意拖延对工人待遇。国民党方面，竟对原来规定无耻抵赖称：“只能根据黄委会之新规定拨发”。解放区复堤工程已开工月余，并未得到黄委会改变工人待遇之通知，解放区代表坚主工人待遇应按已向工人宣布之原定标准拨发，以后如须改变，须经双方共同协商。又国民党方面口头通知称将来面粉告罄后，公粮即续运豆粉，冀鲁豫黄委会对此亦表坚决反对。
    【本报荷泽八日电】郓城修防段一万四千三百修堤工人，自六月十二日开工后，不及半月，即已病倒一千余人。同时因修堤需土，挖毁的青苗地已达二千余亩，参加修堤之贫农，自行塾出工粮及燃料，计已垫出麦子七十五万八千斤、烧柴一百五十一万六千斤，现已罗掘俱穷不仅无力再继续修堤，且生活亦已感严重困难，行将无法维持，乃纷纷开会推举代表，向民主政府请愿，悲愤要求国民党蒋介石立即执行南京协议，要求联总、行总立即按原规定拨运工粮、工款、药品、器材，补偿群众所垫粮柴等，以维群众生活，以利工程继续进行。
