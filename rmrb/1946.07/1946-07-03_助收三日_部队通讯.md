　　Three Days of Helping with the Harvest
　　——Troop Communication
　　Guo Jingren
　　From morning till night the sun bakes the earth, the land is like a yellow sea, the wheat is about to ripen. The ×× regiment stationed in Xingtai had already sent people to the Xingtai County government to discuss helping the masses with the wheat harvest.

　　At dawn on June 8th, every comrade, with a fervent heart, set off in separate directions towards their designated locations. A portion went to Kongqiao in the first district, another to Huining in the fifth district, another to Dong, Nan Zhezhen and Wang Xianxian in the fourth district, and yet another to the southern part of Xingtai city. When the troops arrived at their destinations, the cooks had already prepared the meals and were waiting, and the masses to be helped with the harvest were also organized. After putting down their bowls and chopsticks and receiving their sickles, they were led by the village cadres to start working in separate groups.

　　The soldiers stepped into the boundless wheat fields, the sickles made a "swish swish" sound, and piles of wheat lay behind them. A middle-aged woman with a small child was sitting and resting in a very small wheat field. The soldiers knew at a glance that there was no one to help, so they went up to ask. She said, "That large piece of land over there is my brother's. He forced me to remarry, but I didn't want to. I want to take care of this child, but there's no one to help, so my child and I will harvest slowly." The soldiers were angered by this injustice. They told her not to cut any more and called over a group of soldiers. Four mu of wheat were harvested cleanly in the blink of an eye. The woman was so grateful that she couldn't speak, and at the same time, she didn't know how much the wages would be, and a kind of uneasiness was in her heart. Later, the soldiers took the wheat to the threshing ground, explained the meaning of helping with the harvest, and only then was she completely happy.

　　The soldiers voluntarily went to investigate and learned from the poor masses that the masses had never seen the army helping the masses with work and suffering hardships, neither wanting wages nor eating, helping for nothing. They were grateful beyond words.

　　The next day, before the sun had gotten too hot, people went to the fields with smiling faces. Women, men, soldiers, group after group, bent over from east to west, from north to south, bundling, carrying, shouldering, pushing wheelbarrows, sending the wheat to the threshing ground. The soldiers were full of energy, taking off their shirts, and cutting continuously from the beginning to the end of the field. Comrade Zhang Xiuyan of the Special Task Company cut quickly and was unwilling to rest. Comrades Liu Tianbang, Song Xingye, Gao Zhizhu, Chen Ziliang, Hu Benlong, Chen Xiangshi, and Zhang Yuanchen of the Fifth Company were all excellent. Gao Zhiyi, the Second Squad Leader of the Fifth Company, became ill from fatigue, Lin Tinghe, the Platoon Leader, became ill from fatigue, and Yao Antai of the regimental staff also became ill from fatigue, but none of them rested. Zhang Guangyu, a sick soldier, also participated in wheat cutting, and if he couldn't cut, he would pick up the gleanings behind. Chen Siliang was a patient with sores, but when he heard about helping with the harvest, he insisted on going. He cut a lot and well, and when resting, he helped others sharpen their sickles. His hands blistered, so he wrapped them in towels and continued cutting. The sick comrades said, "Wheat is harvested only once a year, if we don't participate, it will be over. We'll just be sick for a few days, we can grit our teeth and get through it." Comrade Shao Guangmin of the Fifth Company didn't take a nap after cutting wheat, but carried water for the families of soldiers and the poor. In three days, he carried forty-seven loads of water. Li Fuzhen carried more than twenty loads, and the whole company carried a total of one hundred and fourteen loads. Xing Yongtai, the Deputy Squad Leader of the Fifth Squad of the Second Platoon, was a patient, but in one morning, he hoed one and a half mu of millet for the families of soldiers.

　　The First Company was cutting wheat for a poor farmer in Wangkuai who had a family of four (an old man in his fifties), and only cultivated four mu of wheat. We finished cutting it in one morning. The old man brought red and white flour rolls from home, and a bowl of fried garlic sprouts that he hadn't been willing to eat for the Dragon Boat Festival. The soldiers politely declined, but the old man had an idea, and carried the food directly to the First Company's kitchen. He opened the steamer to take a look, and then secretly opened the vegetable pot and poured the garlic sprouts in. The cook noticed someone slipping away from the vegetable pot. He suspected, "What's going on? Is a spy poisoning us?" He was worried, so he opened the pot and found out who had poured in the garlic sprouts. When the wheat-cutting soldiers returned for the meal, the cook told them about it. A group of soldiers stood up and argued, "It must be that old man, no mistake. Last time, the Pingyuan Theater Troupe performed 'The Army and the People are One Family,' and the villagers poured mutton into the army's pot. We didn't believe it then, but we believe it now." Everyone laughed for a while.

　　Four people from the Fourth Squad of the Third Company cut wheat for a poor farmer in Kongqiao with only two people and eight fen of land. The old lady bought two packs of cigarettes for the soldiers to smoke, but the soldiers declined. The old lady felt bad, and secretly put them in Comrade Zhang Wentang's pocket, which was placed by the side of the field. When they returned, Zhang Wentang found two more packs of cigarettes in his pocket. He knew that the old lady had put them in, but he didn't say anything. He secretly put the two packs of cigarettes in the old lady's water jug. They had walked far away, but the old lady caught up, holding those two packs of cigarettes. Comrade Zhang Wentang said, "Old lady, I have cigarettes, you can exchange these two packs of cigarettes for two steamed buns to eat."

　　Guo Yirong, the political instructor of the First Battalion, and several soldiers were resting under the shade of a tree. A poor wheat owner, fumbled in his pocket for a long time, and pulled out a few cigarettes for the soldiers to smoke. The soldiers all said, "We don't smoke, we have them." At this moment, a neatly dressed landlord walked over and interjected in a provocative tone, "Brothers are helping you cut wheat, you give local homemade cigarettes. If it were me, I would definitely buy big cartons of cigarettes." Comrade Guo Yirong quickly explained, "We are cutting wheat not for smoking cigarettes, but for helping the masses; even if we had big cartons of cigarettes, we wouldn't smoke them." After a moment of silence, the landlord turned around and left. A person in Dongwang Village, wearing a long gown and clean, asked Hu Hongqing, the Squad Leader of the Eighth Squad of the Third Company, "What are you eating?" "Millet," Squad Leader Hu replied. "It's not as good as us, we are eating red and white flour," he boasted triumphantly. Squad Leader Hu quickly realized what he was saying, so he told him, "I am a soldier of the people, and I don't like to compare with others about eating good food and wearing good clothes?"

　　The Squad Leader of the Fourth Squad of the Fifth Company led a group of people into a wheat field that was being harvested. The villagers of the mutual aid group stopped the Squad Leader and told him, "This is the landlord's seventeen or eighteen mu of land, which is contracted by our mutual aid group. He pays the wages, but it hasn't been completely harvested yet." When the soldiers heard that it was contracted by the mutual aid group, they all started working. "Helping the mutual aid group, helping them earn money," many people said.

　　Adults and children all recognized the Eighth Route Army, they all started to praise them, and became close to them. The women boldly pulled the thorns from the soldiers' hands. They said, "The army doesn't even drink our saliva, the mutual aid group only drinks the army's water." "The comrades take off their shirts, their backs are blistered from the sun, and as soon as they get home, they don't wash their faces or sleep, but carry water for us. If they're not working, they're singing, it's really good!" The villagers of the mutual aid group said, "As soon as you ask, you know this team is from Shandong. There's a lot of wheat in that place, and the people of Shandong do good work and know how to cut." When the soldiers returned to the village, many young girls and children pulled them to eat: "My mother told you to come eat." A soldier's family member, who was anxious when it wasn't his turn to have his wheat cut, went to find the regimental commander. "Why don't you cut for me, I'm a soldier's family member." A twelve-year-old orphan, suffering from his uncle's anger, wanted the regimental commander to make a fair judgment... The masses began to raise their heads, and the people who were being bullied dared to speak. Those who didn't understand the Eighth Route Army understood, and the deceits and rumors of the bad people were exposed. Originally, when we went to help cut wheat, some people spread rumors saying: "The Eighth Route Army shares 20% of the harvest, they don't help for nothing," "First sweet, then bitter," "Slow poison," "Women don't go out, be careful of being dragged away."... But now, an old lady said, "The Eighth Route Army is better than my son, my son doesn't come to cut wheat for me after we split the household." An old lady in Huining was making obeisance and wanted "the child to join the Eighth Route Army when he grows up."

　　On the third day, the troop's task of helping with the harvest was completed, and everyone came to see them off. The sun had just risen from the eastern horizon, and the army and more masses than had ever attended a meeting gathered at the edge of the village. Slogans were shouted non-stop, and an old man in his sixties nodded in praise: "Never in heaven or earth have I seen this kind of army, from ancient times to the present only the people have served the army, I have never seen the army serving the people!" On the way back, the soldiers discussed helping with the harvest: "I don't feel tired cutting for the poor, the poor people sincerely support us, I feel honored. There are also people at home helping us when we are cutting for the poor outside, so helping the poor cut is equal to cutting for ourselves."

　　At the summary meeting, the model workers who helped with the harvest were praised. A total of 330 people were drawn from the entire regiment to participate in wheat cutting, cutting a total of 1715 mu, an average of more than 1.7 mu per person per day, and nearly 5.2 mu in three days. The Fifth Company had the most, averaging 2.7 mu per person per day, and 8.4 mu in three days. The Special Task Company averaged 2 mu per person per day. If calculated by work (according to the price of work in the Fourth District), a total of 857 work days, each work day is equivalent to five sheng of wheat, a total of 42 dan and 8 dou and 5 sheng can be earned, which saves so much grain for the poor.

　　The masses who were helped with the harvest included: 57 families of soldiers' dependents—296.5 mu. 27 village cadre families—108 mu. 128 poor peasant families—663.5 mu. 111 middle peasant families—577.5 mu. 4 lonely and widowed families—30.5 mu. 8 rich peasant families—39.5 mu.

　　助收三日
    ——部队通讯
    郭竟仁
    太阳从早晒到晚，大地像黄色的海一样，麦子要熟了。驻防邢台的××团早早就派人到邢台县政府去接洽帮助群众麦收的事情。
    六月八日拂晓，每个同志都怀着一颗热忱的心，分头向预定的方向出发了。一部分到一区的孔桥，一部分到五区会宁，一部分到四区东、南这、王先贤，还有一部分到邢台市南关。部队到目的地时，炊事员已经做好饭在等候着，帮收的群众也都布置好了，放下碗筷，领了镰刀，就由村干部带领各组分头动作起来。
    战士们踏入一望无际的麦田，镰刀砂砂作声，一堆一堆的麦子躺在人们的后边。一位中年妇女带着一个小孩子，在一块很小的麦地里坐着休息，战士们看样子知道那是没有人手的，他们跑上去访问，她说：“那边那块大地是俺哥哥的地，他硬逼俺改嫁，俺不愿意，俺愿意守这孩子，没有人，俺母子俩慢慢收吧”，战士被种不平激愤起来，他们不要她再割了，把一伙战士都叫来，四亩麦子，转眼割的净光，那位妇女感激的说不出话来，同时也不知道要多少工钱，心里有一种解不开的疑惧，后来战士们一直把麦子给送上场了，说明了助收的意义之后，她才完全愉快起来。
    战士们自动去调查，从贫苦群众口里知道：群众从来没有见过军队帮助群众做活受苦，既不要工钱也不吃饭，白白帮助，他们感激的不像样子。
    第二天，太阳还没有发火，人们都带着笑脸下地了。妇女、男人、军队、一伙一伙的弯着腰从东到西，从北向南，捆的，背的，挑的，推小车的，把麦子送到场上。战士们的劲头十足，脱光上身，一气割到地头起，特务连张秀延同志割的又快，又不愿意休息，五连刘天榜同志，宋兴业同志，高志铸同志，陈子良同志，胡本龙同志，陈相诗同志，张元臣同志都是好样的。五连二班长高志义累病了，排长林廷和累病了，团直姚安太也累病了但他们都不休息，病号张光玉也参加割麦，不割就在后面拾。陈思良是个疮号，听说帮收他非去不行，割的又多又好，休息时帮助别人磨镰，手上打了泡，用手巾缠起来继续割，病号同志们说：“一年一季麦，不参加就过去了，咱病了几天的事，咬咬牙就过去啦。”五连邵光敏同志割麦回来不睡午觉，给抗属，穷人担水，三天挑水四十七担，李富贞挑了二十多担，全连共挑了一一四担，二排五班副邢永泰是个病号，一晌给抗属锄了一亩半谷子。
    一连在王快给一家贫农割麦，他家里四口人（一个五十多岁的老汉），只种四亩麦地，我们一早晨就给割完了，老汉从家里挑来红白面卷子，炒的一碗过端午没舍的吃的蒜苔，战士都婉言谢绝，老汉心里有主意，把饭一直挑到一连的伙房，掀开蒸笼看了看，于是把菜锅掀开偷偷把蒜苔倒进去，伙夫发觉有人从菜锅旁边溜出去了，他猜疑着：“干吗？特务放毒吗？”他不放心，掀开锅才知道是谁倒进去了蒜苔。吃饭时，割麦的战士们都回来了，炊事员告诉他们这件事，一伙战士站起来争着议论：“一定是那个老汉，没有错。上一次平原剧团演《军民一家》，老乡给军队锅里倒羊肉，咱还不相信，这会可信啦。”大家哈哈笑了一阵。
    三连四班四个人在孔桥给一家仅有两口人八分地的贫农割麦，老太太买了两盒烟给战士们吸，战士们谢绝了，老太太过意不去，偷偷装进放在地边上的张文堂同志的衣袋里，回来时，张文堂发觉衣袋里多了两盒烟，他知道这是老太太装进去的，没有说话，又偷偷把两盒烟放进老太太的水罐里，他们走了很远，老太太追上来了，手里拿着那两盒烟卷，张文堂同志说：“老大娘，俺有烟，你拿这两盒烟还可以换两个馍馍吃。”
    一营教导员郭益荣同志和几位战士，在树荫底下休息，一个贫农麦主，从口袋里摸索半天，抽出几枝香烟给战士们抽，战士们都说：“不抽，我们有。”这时恰恰一位衣冠整洁的的地主走过来，用一种挑拨的口气插嘴说：“兄弟们帮助你割麦子，你给本地土造烟，要是我，我一定买大条烟。”郭益荣同志连忙解释：“我们割麦子不是为的抽烟，是为的帮助群众；有大条烟，我们也不吸”沉默了一会，地主扭过身子走了。东旺村一个穿着长衫，干干净净的人问三连八班长胡宏清同志：“你们吃的什么？”“小米”胡班长回答。“还不如我们呢，我们吃的还是红白面，”得意洋洋的自夸着，胡班长很快警惕到他是在说什么话，于是告诉他：“俺是人民的军队，俺不喜欢和人家比比吃好的穿好的？”
    五连四班长带着一组人走进一块正在收割的麦地里，互助组的老乡拉住四班长告诉他：“这是地主的十七八亩地，是俺互助组包下的，他出工钱，还没割完，”战士们一听是互助组包了的，大家都下手了，“帮助互助组，帮他赚钱，”好多人这样说着。
    大人小孩都认清了八路军，都舆论起来了，亲近起来了，妇女们大胆的给战士们拨着手上的刺，她们说：“军队连咱们口水都不喝，互助组光喝军队的水，”“同志们脱光脊背，脊背上晒的尽泡，一到家不洗脸不睡觉给俺担水，不做活就唱歌，真好！”互助组的老乡说：“这队伍一问就是山东的，那地方麦子多，山东人做活做的好，会割。”战士们回到村里有许多十来岁的小姑娘小孩子们拉他们去吃饭：“俺娘叫你去吃饭。”一位抗属在没有轮到给他割的时候，他着急的去找团长了“为什么不给俺割，俺是抗属。”一个十二岁的孤儿受他叔叔的气，要团长给公断……群众开始抬头了，受气的人敢说话了。对八路军不了解的明白了，坏人的欺骗造谣揭穿了。原来当我们去帮助割麦子的时候，有人造谣说：“八路军二八分红，不白帮助”，“先甜后苦，“慢毒药”“妇女们别出门，小心给拉跑。”……可是现在一位老太太说：“八路军比我的儿子还好，儿子分了家也不给我来割麦子，”会宁一位老太太作着揖要“孩子大了一定去当八路。”
    第三天部队帮收任务完成了，大家都来欢送，太阳刚从东边地平线上升起来，村边集合了军队和从来开会也没到过那样多的群众，口号不停地呼喊，一位六十多岁的老汉点着头称赞；“开天辟地，没见过这队伍，从古到今只有百姓侍候军队，没见过军队侍候老百姓！”战士在归途上交谈着帮收：“给穷人割，我不觉着累，穷人是真心拥护咱们，觉得光荣，咱们在外面给穷人割，家里也有人帮助咱，所以帮助穷人割就等于给咱割。”
    总结会上，帮收的模范劳动者都被表扬了。这次全团抽去参加割麦的一共三三○人，共割了一七一五亩，平均每人每日割一亩七分强，三日割五亩二分弱。五连最多平均每人每日割二亩七分，三日割八亩四分，特务连每人每日割二亩。如果依工计算（按四区工价）共八五七个工，每工合五升麦子，总共能赚四十二担八斗五升，这就给穷人省了这么多的粮食。
    帮助收割了的群众，计有：抗属五七家——二九六亩半。村干二七家—一一○八亩。贫农一二八家——六六三亩半。中农一一一家——五七七亩半。孤寡独四家——三○亩半。富农八家——三九亩半。
