　　Deepen Investigation and Reduction, Eliminate Feudal Exploitation
    Yangcheng Production Exceeds Previous Years
    Shexian, Huguan, and Changzhi Actively Accumulate Fertilizer
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, reports] Yangcheng's production movement this year has surpassed any previous year. Over 89,000 laborers have been organized throughout the county, accounting for 96% of the county's labor force. It is understood that the basic reason for this excellent result is that the leadership, in boldly and thoroughly carrying out the investigation and reduction movement, has enabled farmers to more completely escape feudal exploitation and improve their living and working conditions. For example, in 22 administrative villages in the first district, 3,470 impoverished farmers, who obtained the fruits of struggle through the emancipation movement, accounted for about half of the total population and received more than 5,000 mu of land, more than 400 head of livestock, and more than 3,000 dan of grain. In Yantoushan Village in the sixth district, there were originally 149 poor peasants, but now there are only 50 households, with the rest rising to become middle-rich peasants. If there are no droughts or floods in the second half of the year, based on the county's total crop area of over 540,000 mu, it is estimated that over 700,000 dan of fine grain can be harvested, and over 30,000 mu of cotton land is expected to yield over 606,000 jin of clean cotton after autumn. The county's 205,000 people will be able to achieve a state of being well-fed and clothed. Regarding rural sideline industries such as silkworm farming, according to statistics from 118 villages, this year 40,078 silkworm beds were raised, and 7,730 silk skeins were reeled, which can be sold for 92.76 million yuan, several times more than last year. According to statistics from the first district, this year 312 pigs, 1,260 sheep, and 2,587 chickens were raised, all about double the number of last year.
    [This newspaper, Changzhi, reports] To prepare fertilizer for wheat fields, Taihang areas have begun a fertilizer accumulation movement. Under the leadership of labor hero Li Baojing in Dafeng Village, sixth district of Shexian, 2,850 dan of fertilizer have been accumulated. Coupled with chemical and pen manure, each of the village's 340 mu of land will have a minimum average of 35 dan of manure. To solve the difficulty of wheat field fertilizer, labor hero Bai Duoyu of Linqing Village, fourth district of Huguan, led the women and children of the entire village to collect sheep manure pellets on the mountains, collecting a total of four dan in four days. In Nanquanzhuang and other villages in the fifth district of Changzhi, due to the increased organization of work this year, the remaining labor force has all been involved in the fertilizer accumulation movement.

　　深入查减解除封建剥削
    阳城生产超过往年         
    涉、壶、长治积极沤肥
    【本报阳城讯】阳城今年的生产运动超过已往任何一年，全县已组织起来的劳动力达八万九千余人，占全县劳力百分之九十六。据悉，得到这种优良成果的基本原因是领导上在大胆放手深入查减运动中，使农民较为彻底的摆脱了封建剥削，改善了生活与劳动条件，例如一区二十二个行政村，经翻身运动获得斗争果实的贫苦农民，共三千四百七十人，约占全人口之半数，共得土地五千余亩，牲口四百余头，粮食三千余石；六区岩头山村原有贫农一百四十九人，现在仅有五十户，余均上升为中富农。如后半年不发生旱潦天灾，按照全县作物面积五十四万余亩计算，可收七十余万石细粮，三万余亩棉地，预计秋后可收净花六十万六千余斤，全县二十万五千余人，即可达到足衣足食之境地。农村副业方面之养蚕业，据一百十八个村的统计，今年养蚕四万零七十八席，缫丝七千七百三十把，可卖九千二百七十六万元，比去年超过数倍；另据一区的统计，今年养猪三百十二口、养羊一千二百六十只、养鸡二千五百八十七只，也均超过去年一倍左右。
    【本报长治讯】为准备麦地肥料，太行各地已开始沤肥运动。涉县六区大峰村在劳动英雄李保晶领导下，现已沤肥二千八百五十担，再加上化肥、圈肥，全村三百四十亩地，每亩最低限度平均可上三十五担粪。壶关四区林青庄劳动英雄白多鱼，为解决麦地肥料困难，领导全村妇女儿童上山拾羊粪蛋，四天共拾了四担。长治五区南泉庄等村，由于今年组织起来作活多，剩余劳力全部卷入沤粪运动中去。
