　　Spinning, Weaving, Learning, Carrying Water, and Going to the Fields
    Women of Wu'an City Display a New Spirit
    Civil Education Center Rewards Production and Learning Models

    [Reported by this newspaper] In the past, under the old feudal life, the women of Wu'an City loved to eat, dress, and not work, developing lazy and corrupt habits. After the city's liberation, under the leadership and education of the democratic government and the Women's Federation, they gradually changed from their past extravagant habits to diligence and simplicity. A new spirit of "parasitism is shameful, labor is honorable" began to be established. In the past, only 76 poor women in the city engaged in spinning and weaving, and 205 went to the fields to work. Now, 763 women who never worked in the past have learned or are actively learning to spin cotton, 73 are learning to knit sweaters, 43 are learning to weave socks on sock knitting machines, and 470 are participating in field labor—harvesting wheat, hoeing, weeding, and carrying manure, etc. Each street and household competes to cut spinning wheel bands, and there are often 744 spinning wheels in operation. Currently, 1,235 young and middle-aged women in the city have joined the Women's Federation, gradually embarking on the road of diligent production.
    In the past, Wang Ke's family smoked foreign cigarettes and spent their days visiting neighbors and playing cards. Now, she has learned to spin cotton and picks up wheat in the fields, and one day carried 25 loads of water. Zhang Cuiwen used to have someone fan her even on hot days last year, but this year she is actively spinning cotton even in the hot weather.
    There are now five women's civil schools spontaneously organized by various streets, with 300 women regularly participating in learning. In the civil schools, they compose songs, write clappers, and create blackboard newspapers, demonstrating their boundless enthusiasm for learning and progress. On the anniversary of the July 7th Incident, the Wu'an City Civil Education Center held a women's production and learning competition, which was enthusiastically participated in by women throughout the city. After five days of evaluation, Wang Yuemei and Wang Ke's family, who had never worked before but have now changed for the better, were among the 40 people who won labor prizes, and 15 women with excellent academic performance received learning prizes.

　　纺织学习担水下地
    武安城妇女呈新风气
    民教馆奖励生产学习模范
    【本报讯】武安城的妇女，过去在封建的旧生活下，爱吃穿不劳动，养成懒惰腐化的习惯。城市解放后，在民主政府及妇联会的领导教育下，逐渐改变过去奢糜旧习为勤劳朴素，“寄生可耻，劳动为荣”的新风气开始树立。过去全城只有贫苦妇女七十六人进行纺织，二百零五人下地劳动，现在已有过去根本不劳动的妇女七百六十三人学会和正在积极学习纺花，七十三人学织毛衣，四十三人学织袜机织袜子，四百七十人参加田地劳动——割麦，锄地，拔草，挑粪等，各街各户争割纺花车，经常有七百四十四辆纺车在转动，现全城有一千二百三十五名青中年妇女参加了妇联会，逐渐走向勤劳生产之路。
    妇女王科的家，过去抽洋烟，整天串门子打牌，现已学会了纺花，下地拾麦子，有一天担了二十五担水。妇女张翠文，去年热天坐在家里还要人打扇，今年大热天也积极纺花。
    各街自发组织起来的妇女民校已有五处，有三百个妇女经常参加学习，在民校里她们自己编歌、编快板、编黑板报，表现出她们要求学习进步的无限热情。七七纪念日武安城民教馆特举行妇女生产学习竞赛，全城妇女均热烈参加，经过五天评选，结果有王月梅和从不劳动现在转好的王科的家等四十人，荣获劳动奖品，十五名学习成绩优良的妇女获得学习奖品。
