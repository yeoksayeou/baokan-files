Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a broadcast speech on the 15th, reporting on the situation of the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference. Byrnes stated that the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference had passed draft treaties, which was the "greatest struggle" of the conference since Victory Day regarding treaties with former Axis powers and their vassal states. Byrnes said: "Although these treaties are not the best treaties that human wisdom can devise, they are the best treaties that human wisdom can find and that the four major allies can seek agreement on." Byrnes pointed out that discussions on the German and Austrian questions had made no progress and defended his proposed 25-year plan for disarming Germany. When discussing the unification of the current four occupation zones of Germany's economy, Byrnes opposed the policies of the Soviet Union and France. Byrnes also revealed that representatives of the U.S. occupying authorities in Germany would be ordered within the week to cooperate with any or all of the occupying governments in Germany on major administrative and economic issues. Byrnes concluded: "Despite the many difficulties, we will continue to consult to restore the war-torn world to a state of peace, so that soldiers can return home and enjoy family happiness, and turn our swords into plowshares, and swords and spears into gifts of jade and silk."
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 18th: United Press reported that the draft treaties for the five countries of Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland were finalized on the evening of the 15th at the final meeting of the four foreign ministers' assistants. The draft treaties will be immediately telegraphed to the governments of 21 countries.
