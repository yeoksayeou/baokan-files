Bohai Temporary参议会
    Sends Telegram to Chairman Mao Congratulating "July 1st"
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] On the 25th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China on "July 1st," Liu Qiaoting, Speaker of the Shandong Bohai Liberated Area Temporary 参议会, Vice Speaker Liu Guanjia, and all councilors, yesterday sent a telegram to Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China congratulating him on the 25th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China on "July 1st." The telegram stated: The history of the past twenty-five years proves that your party is the only great party in our country that loyally serves the people, and you, sir, are the great leader of the people of our country. The eight million people in our Bohai area have found a clear direction and the most intimate friends from their own experience of emancipation. Now, domestic fascists, with the assistance of American imperialist elements, are attempting to provoke a nationwide civil war, continue feudal dictatorship, and enslave the people of the whole country. Our eight million people in the area vow to join hands with your party and the people of the whole country to fight to the end for the establishment of an independent, peaceful, democratic, and happy New China!
