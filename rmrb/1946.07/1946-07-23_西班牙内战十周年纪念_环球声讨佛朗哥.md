　　Spanish Civil War Tenth Anniversary Memorial
    Global Condemnation of Franco
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 19th] Comprehensive report: Yesterday (July 18th) marked the tenth anniversary of the Spanish Civil War launched by Franco. Many groups in various countries issued calls on this day, demanding sanctions against Franco and granting freedom to the Spanish people. Giral, the president of the Spanish Republican government in exile, called on the Spanish people to unite around the democratic alliance and join hands with Republicans, Socialists, Communists, the General Labor Union, and members of the National Confederation of Labor. He said: "The main responsibility for the freedom of Spain lies with ourselves." Latin American workers, under the banner of the Latin American Labor Federation in the United States, have launched a movement to boycott goods to and from Spain starting on the 18th. British Labour Party Chairman Baker and 600 members of Parliament jointly urged the British government to "take measures, through the United Nations, to help the Spanish people regain their freedom." Two Soviet newspapers in Berlin demanded the swift liquidation of the Spanish dictatorship.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, July 20th] Comprehensive report: On July 18th, the tenth anniversary of the Spanish Civil War, anti-Franco movements were also held in New York and Belgrade. In New York, under the auspices of the "Action Committee to Liberate Spain Immediately," a delegation composed of representatives from trade unions, veterans, and other American organizations went to the Spanish Consulate General in New York to protest Spain's continued massacre and imprisonment of Republican figures. At the same time, the Action Committee released a statement by six American celebrities, condemning the US government's attitude towards Spain and urging the government to immediately sever relations with the Franco government, stating: "Franco would not be able to continue to exist without direct or indirect support from the United States." In Belgrade, a mass meeting on the anniversary of the Spanish Civil War resolved to demand the swift elimination of the Franco regime and that the United Nations stipulate that all its member states sever relations with the "bandit regime."
