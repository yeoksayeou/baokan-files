Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 11th. UNRRA special envoys Fan Mingde and Yue Luhai arrived in Hui on the 2nd and met with Li Renfeng, Director of the Bohai Liberated Area Administrative Office. The purpose of their trip is to urge Jinan to repair the river and restore the dikes, and to understand the river repair situation downstream. According to Fan and Yue, the Kuomintang government authorities will partially release water on July 20th. Director Li pointed out that the Bohai Liberated Area has the most dangerous works and the project is huge. Due to the lack of materials, it is difficult to complete in a short period of time. He hoped that after inspecting the downstream situation, the two would report to the Yellow River Commission and advise the authorities to wait until the dyke repair is completed before releasing water. He also suggested organizing a working group with the Jinan authorities to supervise river repair and return the equipment seized from Liu Jiqing, the Yellow River management representative of the Liberated Area. The two agreed to raise the matter. The two inspected the Lijin area on the afternoon of the same day and returned to Jinan on the 3rd, expressing their admiration for the dike restoration projects in various places.

    【新华社延安十一日电】联总特派范铭德及岳陆海两氏，于二日抵惠晤渤海解放区行署李人凤主任，两氏此行系督促济南修河复堤，并了解下游修河情形。据范岳两氏谈，国民党政府当局将于七月二十日部分放水，为此李主任提出渤海解放区内险工最多，工程浩大，因材料缺乏，短期间实难完成，希两氏于视察下游实情后，报告黄委会建议当局，待修堤完成再行放水。并建议与济南当局组织一工作小组，监督修河，并退还劫夺解放区治黄代表刘季清所携之器材。两氏当允提出交涉。两氏于当日午后至利津一带视察，三日返济，对各地复堤工程，表示钦佩。
