　　[This Dispatch from our Newspaper in Handan] Vice-Chairman @Yun'an, a senior gentleman of the Provisional Assembly of the Central Plains Liberated Area, has safely arrived here from the Central Plains and has been warmly welcomed by all parties. @Old Mr. is sixty-three years old, his hair is gray, but his spirit is still very vigorous. Before the War of Resistance, he served as the county magistrate of Dengfeng County, Henan Province, the commander of the Yu-Xi Garrison, and the secretary of the Ministry of Justice in Beiping. Shortly after the start of the War of Resistance, he was elected as the vice-chairman of the Provisional Assembly of the Central Plains Liberated Area. @Old Mr. asked the reporter with great concern about the breakthrough of the New Fourth Army in the Central Plains. When he heard that Chiang's army continued to pursue and encircle, he said angrily: "The Fifth Division of the People's Army in the Central Plains liberated vast areas from the hands of the Japanese invaders, supported the eight-year War of Resistance, and became a powerful barrier to defend the southwest and northwest. They have the right to be stationed in the Central Plains Liberated Area. The Chinese Communist Party, in order to seek China's independence, peace, and democracy, is willing to withdraw the troops of the Fifth Division of the Central Plains Military Region to North China. This shows that the Communist Party has made great concessions. But Chiang Kai-shek is determined to have a civil war and to eliminate this troop who has contributed to the country and the nation. Chiang Kai-shek's ambition as a dictator and traitor will inevitably suffer a shameful setback. The people of the Central Plains will stand with the Fifth Division to crush this bloody conspiracy." @Old Mr. continued to express great concern to the fathers, elders, brothers, sisters in the Central Plains who are being brutally suppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries. He expressed his gratitude to the Party, government, army, civilians, and all the people in the border area for their meticulous care of the wounded and sick soldiers in the Central Plains. He said loudly: "The people of the whole country and the whole liberated area are with us. The military and civilians of the Central Plains are never isolated." After @Mr. arrived in Handan, Liu Dong, Wang Xizhang, and others, who were wounded and sick soldiers from the Fifth Division and are now students at Northern University, sent letters to @Old Mr. to express their condolences.

　　[Handan, 23rd] Comrade Song Funan (Organization Minister of the Fifth Division), who previously led the wounded and sick soldiers of the Central Plains Military Region to this place, recently expressed his gratitude on behalf of all comrades to the leaders and all the military and civilians of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region for their warm help in receiving treatment and recuperation, saying: "When we arrived in the border area, the masses along the way competed to carry stretchers, and at night they lit lanterns and torches to welcome us from afar. Some old men held our hands and sent us seven or eight miles before returning. As soon as we arrived at Liuhegou, Pengcheng, and Fengfeng, the workers had already put us in the best houses, invited us to take baths and have meals. The Fengfeng Coal Mine even sent us to Matou by train. In the past, the Kuomintang blockaded the Central Plains Liberated Area, and we could not get cloth. Everyone was still wearing cotton clothes. Commander Liu immediately tried to issue two new sets of single clothes, a white shirt, quilts, soap, etc. to each of us, and personally presided over a dinner party to comfort and encourage us to have a good rest. He gave us special additional food allowance, two meals of white flour and one meal of rice a day. The Central Bureau also immediately allocated 10 million yuan as a production fund and family allowance. Since we arrived here, we have received many letters of condolence and comfort goods from various units and regions every day. Today we received many letters of comfort, cash, and a large number of comfort goods from the Democratic National Construction School. The wounded and sick soldiers of our Fifth Division have received such material and spiritual help, and are eager to regain their health and return to the combat posts as soon as possible."

　　中原临参会副议长＠云庵老先生莅邯
    宋甫南同志答谢边区军民
    【本报邯郸讯】中原解放区临参会副议长＠云庵老先生已由中原安全抵此，备受各方热烈欢迎。＠老高年六十三，须发斑白，精神仍极健旺。抗战前曾任河南登封县长、豫西警备司令、北平司法部秘书，抗战开始不久，即被选为中原解放区临参会副议长。＠老非常关切的询问记者中原新四军突围经过，当他听到蒋军继续追击围歼的时候，他气愤愤的说：“中原人民子弟兵五师，从日寇手中解放了广大地区，支持八年抗战，成为保卫西南西北的有力屏障，他们是有权利驻防中原解放区的。中国共产党为了谋求中国的独立和平民主，愿将中原军区五师部队撤至华北，这说明共产党作了很大的让步。但是蒋介石万一定要内战，一定要消灭这支有功于国家民族的子弟兵而后已。蒋介石这独夫民贼的企图，定会遭到可耻的碰壁，中原人民将和五师站在一起，粉碎这一流血大阴谋”。＠老继向正遭受国民党反动派残酷清剿的中原父老兄弟姊妹，表示极大的关怀。他对于边区党政军民和全体人民对中原伤病员爱护备至，表示十分感激，他大声的说：“全国全解放区人民都同我们一道，中原军民永远不是孤立的。”＠氏抵邯后，前由五师来此之伤病员及现在北方大学之学员刘东、王锡璋等纷纷致函＠老慰问。
    【邯郸二十三日电】前率中原军区伤病员抵此之宋甫南同志（五师组织部长），顷代表全体同志对晋冀鲁豫边区各首长及全体军民热情帮助招待疗养表示答谢称：“我们来到边区，沿途群众争抬担架，晚间点着灯笼火把远迎远送。有的老汉握着我们的手送到七八里才回去。一到六河沟，彭城、峰峰，工人早已把最好的房子给我们住，请我们洗澡会餐，峰峰煤矿并以火车把我们送到马头。过去国民党封锁中原解放区，我们得不到布匹，大家穿的还是棉衣，刘司令员立刻设法给我们每人发了两套新单衣，一套白衬衣还有被子肥皂等，并亲自主持会餐联欢，安慰、鼓励我们好好休养，给我们特别增发菜金，每日两餐白面一顿大米，中央局还立刻为我们拨了一千万元作为生产基金，和安抚家属费。自从我们抵此后，连日都接到各单位各地区很多慰问信和慰劳品，今天又接到民主建国学校许多慰劳信，现款和大量的慰劳品。我们五师伤病员得到这样的物质和精神上的帮助，都热望早日恢复健康，走上战斗的岗位。”
