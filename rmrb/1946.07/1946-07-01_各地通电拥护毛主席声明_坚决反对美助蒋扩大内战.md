　　【This dispatch from our newspaper in Handan on the 28th】Various sectors in the Border Region and factories in important cities have held meetings consecutively in recent days to discuss Chairman Mao's statement on the 22nd. They unanimously believe that stopping the US armed interference in China's internal affairs and stopping US military aid to the Kuomintang government are the fundamental keys to clarifying China's current situation. General Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, stated: The Kuomintang reactionaries, relying on US aid, dare to launch large-scale offensives against the liberated areas. If the United States does not stop this aid, it is helping the continued expansion of China's civil war. Chairman Mao's statement pointed out a clear path for the people of China and the United States. We firmly oppose the US military aid bill for China, demand the immediate withdrawal of US troops in China, and oppose US interference in China's internal affairs. Yang and Rong, the Vice Chairmen of the Border Region Government, representing 30 million people, told our reporter: Our Border Region people have sacrificed blood for the cause of Chinese democracy and peace. Now, US imperialism wants to turn China into its dependency and help Chiang Kai-shek fight a civil war. We, the entire people of the Border Region, resolutely oppose this kind of imperialist behavior! Various mass organizations in the Border Region have also sent telegrams one after another, resolutely opposing US interference in China's internal affairs and supporting Chairman Mao's solemn statement. Old worker Wei Dekui said: "Chairman Mao, you have spoken the words that have been held in our people's hearts for a long time. The American troops should withdraw from China immediately, and we must fight to the end for an independent new China!"
    【Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 26th】Mass organizations such as workers, peasants, women, and youth in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, as well as people from all walks of life in Zhangjiakou City, have recently issued telegrams and statements, fully agreeing with Chairman Mao's statement against the United States continuing to provide military aid to the Kuomintang dictatorial government, and are willing to support it with all their strength. The statement makes demands of the US government, and the telegrams from various mass organizations solemnly point out: "We cannot trust the US government's attitude towards the Chinese people today." The telegram resolutely demands that the US government authorities immediately cease and withdraw all military aid to the Kuomintang government, and promptly withdraw US troops stationed in China.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th】Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's statement against US military aid to China has aroused great attention and support here. Yesterday (the 25th) at 9:00 AM, representatives from mass organizations such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Workers' Association, Youth League, Women's Federation, Chamber of Commerce, Cultural Association, and the Overseas Chinese Federation in Yan'an braved the rain to gather at the conference hall of the Foreign Affairs Office to discuss this statement. At the meeting, it was unanimously stated that in order to safeguard China's sovereignty and independence, and to seek peace, democracy, and freedom for the Chinese people, the people of the liberated areas will, together with the entire Chinese people, vow to oppose the US State Department's proposed military aid bill to Chiang. They unanimously demanded that the United States immediately cease and withdraw all military aid to China, and immediately withdraw US troops stationed in China. Finally, a telegram was passed to the US President, the Senate and House of Representatives, and various democratic groups, calling for a halt to the passage of the US military aid to China bill.
