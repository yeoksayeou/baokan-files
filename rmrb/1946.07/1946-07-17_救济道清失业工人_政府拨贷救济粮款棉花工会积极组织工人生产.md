　　Relief for Unemployed Workers of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway
    Government Allocates Loans and Relief Grain, Cotton Workers' Union Actively Organizes Worker Production
    [This newspaper's Jiaozuo dispatch] There are currently more than 180 unemployed workers from the Daokou-Qinghua Railway in this city. Including their families, there are more than 500 people in total. Because transportation cannot be restored and it is not easy to change careers, they have fallen into extreme poverty. The Special Commissioner's Office, the Municipal Government, and the Daokou-Qinghua Railway Workers' Union have decided on three relief measures: (1) The Fourth Branch of the Jinnan Bank will loan each unemployed worker 2,000 yuan as capital for productive activities. (2) The Cooperatives will loan each unemployed worker's family 2 *jin* of cotton, organizing all the families of unemployed workers from the Daokou-Qinghua Railway to engage in textile production. (3) Taking care of especially poor technical workers, the Jiaozuo Municipal Government will issue two *dou* of relief grain to each especially poor technical worker. These grains and cotton are uniformly received and distributed by the Daokou-Qinghua Railway Workers' Union. Currently, the Daokou-Qinghua workers are actively organizing workers to carry out self-salvation through production.
    In order to provide relief to the unemployed workers of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway, the Taihang Administrative Office has decided to allocate 100 *shi* of public grain (millet) and 200,000 yuan to support workers in engaging in production or changing careers in all aspects, so that unemployed workers and the families of deceased workers can maintain a minimum standard of living. The Jiaozuo Municipal Government and the Daokou-Qinghua Railway Workers' Union are also determined to organize the self-salvation through production of unemployed workers of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway before transportation is restored and railway workers can resume work.

　　救济道清失业工人
    政府拨贷救济粮款棉花工会积极组织工人生产
    【本报焦作讯】本市现有道清失业工人一百八十余名，连其家属共五百余口，因交通不能恢复，转业又不易，以致生活陷于极端困难的境地。专署、市府及道清路工会，已决定了三项救济办法：（一）由冀南银行四分行贷给每个失业工人二千元，作为工人从事生产的资金。（二）由合作总社贷给每个失业工人家属棉花二斤把整个道，清失业工人家属都组织到纺织生产中来。（三）照顾特别贫苦的技术工人，每个特别贫苦的技术工人，由焦作市政府发给救济粮两大斗。这些粮款棉花，都由道清工会统一领发，现道清工人正在积极组织工人，进行生产自救。
    太行行署为救济道清铁路失业工人，特决定拨公粮小米一百石，款二十万元，从各方面扶植工人从事生产或转业，使失业工人及死难工人家属得以维持最低限度的生活标准。焦作市府及道清工会亦决心在交通没有恢复，铁路工人不能复业前，要组织道清铁路失业工人的生产自救。
