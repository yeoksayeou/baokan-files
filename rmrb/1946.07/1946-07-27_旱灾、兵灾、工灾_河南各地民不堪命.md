Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: According to the Tianjin Dagong Daily, representatives of the Lu Disaster Relief Delegation stated that the people of Henan are suffering intolerably under the weight of drought, war, and construction disasters. The wheat harvest in various areas is only 30% of normal, and the autumn crops are already showing signs of drought, leading to utter despair. Furthermore, a large number of troops, totaling as many as 600,000, are gathered within the province, creating a serious war disaster. The Nationalist authorities' dike-building project in Henan mobilized 210,000 laborers, each receiving only 450 yuan per day. According to regulations, one jin of flour should be issued at no cost per worker per day, but the dike-building project office still deducted 150 yuan per jin from their wages, creating a construction disaster. Senior officials of the project office live in newly built Western-style buildings and are attended by Shanghai dancing girls. As for military expenses, they are forcibly collected from counties and towns within Henan province, amounting to 600,000,000,000 yuan.

　　旱灾、兵灾、工灾
    河南各地民不堪命
    【新华社延安二十二日电】据天津大公报载：鲁灾呼吁团代表谈称，河南的旱灾、兵灾、工灾等，层层压在人民身上，使民不堪命。现各地麦收仅三成，秋禾旱象又成，已完全绝望，加以境内大军云集数达六十万，形成严重兵灾。国民党当局在河南的堵口工程，动员了民工二十一万人，每日每工仅四百五十元，按总规定不取价发给的面粉一斤，但堵口工程处仍以每斤一百五十元在工价中扣除，这又形成工灾。工程处大员，住新建洋楼大厦，并有上海舞女作陪。至于军费，则在豫境各县镇强迫征缴达六十万万元。
