Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th. Nanjing News: After the Xiaguan Incident, all circles in Nanjing and Shanghai were greatly angered, and Chinese and foreign public opinions criticized it. However, the spokesman of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department made a statement on the 24th, defending the special agent thugs who committed the crime, calling them "refugees," and openly expressing "deep sympathy," which aroused dissatisfaction among social public opinion. On the 25th, the Central Propaganda Department held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters in Nanjing. The reporters relentlessly raised questions, making Peng Xuepei flustered and red-faced, almost unable to step down. The reporter first asked: When the petition representatives at Xiaguan Station were beaten, several foreign reporters were present and witnessed it. For several hours, the military police turned a deaf ear, as if someone was instructing them. Who should be responsible for this matter? Peng Xuepei stammered and said, "The city's police have many difficulties and lack transportation, making it difficult to mobilize quickly(?)," but he also had to admit that "the protection was inadequate and it is difficult to shirk the blame." Then, Peng Xuepei brought up the matter of the 100,000 people in Shanghai who captured special agents during the anti-civil war parade on the 23rd, and slandered the anti-civil war movement in Shanghai as a "conspiracy strategy," attempting to divert attention. However, the reporters were not confused and then questioned the Central Propaganda Department, saying: The perpetrators who beat and humiliated Mr. Ma and his party were refugees from northern Jiangsu. If this is true, how can it be proven? How many people were arrested for the atrocities, and what are their names and origins? Foreign reporters also asked, if these thugs were refugees, why did they have such a tight organization when they committed the atrocities that day? At this point, Peng Xuepei was completely embarrassed and gave a completely irrelevant answer, saying: "The refugees from northern Jiangsu are currently launching an association, which was established on the 24th."

　　关于南京惨案
    弄得彭学沛面红耳赤
    记者不留情面提出质问
    【新华社延安二十七日电】南京讯：下关事件发生后，京沪各界大为激愤，中外舆论纷纷抨击，而国民党中宣部发言人竟于二十四日发表谈话，为行凶之特务暴徒辩护，称彼等为“难民”，公然表示“不胜同情”，此举尤引起社会舆论之不满。二十五日，中宣部在京举行中外记者招待会，记者不留情面的纷纷提出质问，弄得彭学沛面红耳赤，几乎无法下台。记者首问：下关车站请愿代表被殴时，若干外记者都在场目击，历时数小时之久，军警置若罔闻，似乎有人指使，此事究应何人负责？彭学沛支吾其词地说：“本市警察困难颇多，又缺乏运输工具，难于迅速调动（？）”，但亦不能不承认“保护不力，难辞其咎”。接着，彭学沛提出沪市各界十万群众于二十三日反内战大游行时捕获特务之事，并污蔑沪市各界反内战运动为“阴谋之策略”，企图转移视线，但诸记者不为迷惑，旋又质问中宣部称：殴辱马氏一行的凶犯为苏北难民，如果属实，何以证明？暴行者被逮捕若干人，其姓名籍贯如何？外记者并问，如谓彼辈暴徒为难民，为何当日暴行时竟有如此严密组织？彭学沛至此，窘态毕露，竟牛头不对马嘴的答称：“苏北难民等刻正在发起组织协会，该会已于二十四日成立”。
