Bad Government
(By William Gray)

This dispatch, published in the notoriously anti-communist Time magazine on June 10th, exposing the reality of the Kuomintang government, caused a great uproar in Nanjing. Song Ziwen held a special reception for foreign journalists on June 19th, strongly arguing that it was "ignorant of the facts and only based on depraved ideas." – Editor

An Old Problem

"What can be said when the bank is about to collapse?" – This sentence applies well to China. If the truth is told, it will trigger an economic panic, and American banks will inevitably collapse. If we don’t tell the truth, we become accomplices in this scam. Perhaps the best hope is to tell the truth before this institution suffers misfortune, in order to reorganize it.

The most important fact about China is that almost no one in China has any confidence in the current government, believing it has the ability to manage the entire country intelligently, well, and justly.

Economically, China is declining, and it maintains itself through a ridiculous economy. All the reprehensible commercial practices of today, if not led by government officials, are at least approved by them. The current economy is one of printed currency inflation and government-supported black market transactions. Inflation affects the entire country, as can be seen from the strike decision of judges of China's highest court in Nanjing today, demanding higher wages, requiring the government to increase the base salary of public servants by a thousand times.

What is Sovereignty For?

Now it seems that whether the ceasefire negotiations (with the Communist Party) will succeed is no longer very important. Real peace cannot be seen anywhere... The question of "what is sovereignty for" has finally begun to bother Americans in China. So far, sovereignty is corruption, unreasonableness, and the use of force to maintain the government, and this is by no means an extreme view. It is a rather realistic, fair, and moderate view that can be expressed even among polite capitalist friends.

Grab and Run!

An American lawyer in Shanghai, who is fiercely anti-communist, criticized me one evening: "The government is not a government, it is simply a group of ugly, profit-seeking bureaucrats. They grab whatever can make money, and they have lost their faith." "Profit-seeking," we must add, also extends to Americans. In Shanghai today, this desire to grab and run transcends racial and national boundaries, and confidence in long-term investment is lacking. An American dentist who was originally prepared to practice medicine in China sold his dental equipment and went home because this earned him twice as much money as he could have earned practicing medicine in a few years. A foreign businessman bought a house for more than 13,000 US dollars last autumn and recently sold it for 136,000 US dollars and retired to his home country. The first 1946 Chrysler sedan arrived in Shanghai and was sold by a kind-hearted American businessman for 3,000 US dollars, earning a considerable income, but he now feels like a fool because it was recently resold for 24,000 US dollars.

The central government turned the textile factories taken over from the Japanese into state-owned enterprises, thus monopolizing the entire textile market; government loans enabled a private enterprise company to dominate the entire Shanghai black market rice price. At the same time, the government also blocked the Chinese truck market by "temporarily" suspending the import of new American trucks, wanting to dump 15,000 trucks. These trucks were originally intended for the Burma Road and Ledo Road, each gallon of which could only run a very uneconomical four miles.

…Sun Ke, the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, invited Song Ziwen, the President of the Executive Yuan, to attend the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan this week and answer some questions regarding economic difficulties, but Song Ziwen did not show up. Later, Sun Ke sent Mr. Ma Yinchu, the respected Kuomintang economist (who was imprisoned during the war for criticizing the central government), to Shanghai to continue attacking "bureaucratic capital." Mr. Ma talked about the government concentrating funds and using public funds for private commodities or gold hoarding in front of those semi-official and semi-private institutions, such as the Bank of China Research Institute and the Agricultural Economic Research Institute. This matter, in China today, has changed from a shameful act to a normal one. Shanghai's Chinese newspapers reported on Friday that the police had prohibited Mr. Ma from giving his next speech as planned.

Only One Good Government Allowed

How can all this be changed? And what should be the position of the United States? Our position in China is undeniably linked to our military bases around the world, and due to the gradual deterioration of relations with the Soviet Union, it will continue to increase. Perhaps this fact gives confidence to the die-hard Kuomintang, who smugly ask themselves: Because of the ideological connection between the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party, what can the Americans do except continue to support the central government? They believe that because our military strategic bases link us to the central government, whether we like their attitude and economic policies or not.

On the other hand, within the liberal circles of the Kuomintang, another suggestion is being discussed. …The Kuomintang now has enough troops to protect itself, but it cannot permanently keep the lid on 400 million unfortunate people. If the United States cannot promote a liberal revolution, then it is best to withdraw. There is no way to stop the Communist Party of China's revolutionary path unless there is a good government.

The current government is selfishly and completely inhumanely consuming American supplies and money. A foreign transport person told an American friend a story that he had been an agent of the government to acquire the remaining American medicines on Iwo Jima. A week after these items were handed over to the government, they had become private goods in a Shanghai warehouse, waiting for black market profits.

The Only Hope

China's current government has neither achieved peace nor economic well-being... The solution lies in a major internal purge... The improved government must give the people a fair and good government and peace. This is the only long-term hope we can see.

　　恶政府
    （威廉·格雷作）
    发表于六月十日的素以反共著名的时代杂志上的这篇暴露国民党政府现实的通讯，曾在南京引起轩然大波，宋子文六月十九日为此专门招待了一次外国记者，强说它是“昧于实况，仅系出于猥袤的思想。”——编者
    一个老的难题
    “在银行快要倒闭的时候，还能讲什么呢？”——这句话正好应用到中国来，如果要说实话的话，就会掀起一种经济界的恐慌，美银行也就势必要倒闭了。如果不说呢，又会使自己在这骗局中当一个同谋者。也许最好的希望，就是在这机构还没有遭难之前，把真话讲出来，好重新改组它。
    对于中国最重要的事实，就是在中国几乎没有一个人对于目前的政府还有什么信心、认为他还有能力很聪明很好很公正的来管理整个国家。
    经济上，中国正在衰微之中，它借一种荒唐的经济来维持，这里面当今一切令人疾首的商业风气，纵非政府官吏所领导，至少也是他们所批准的。现在的经济是一种印制品的通货膨涨，和政府支持的黑市交易。通货膨胀影响及于全国，这可以从今天南京中国最高法庭法官决定罢工要求更高工资上看出来，他们要求政府提高公役基薪一千倍。
    主权究竟为什么？
    现在似乎停战谈判（与共产党的）能否成功已经没有多大关系，真正的和平，什么地方都看不到……，“主权究竟为什么”这一问题，最后开始烦扰着在中国的美国人了。到目前为止，主权就是贪污不合理和用武力来维持政府，而且这绝不是过激的见解，实在是相当现实公正和温和的看法，就是在有礼貌的资本家朋友之中，也可以用来表白的。
    抓了就跑！
    上海有一个激烈反共产党的美国律师，在某一个晚上这样向我批评道：“政府算不得政府，简直是一群丑恶的唯利是图的官僚，什么东西能赚钱，能抓就抓，他们已经失掉了信仰。”“唯利是图”，我们必须加一句，也伸展到了美国人身上。在今天的上海来说抓了就跑的这种欲望，超越了种族与国家的界线，鼓励长期投资信心已经缺乏。一个美国牙科医生本来是预备到中国来行医的，结果把他那一套医牙家具卖掉之后，就回家去了，因为这比他在几年之内行医所可能赚的钱，还要多一倍。一个外国商人去年秋天用一万三千多美金买了一所房子，最近以十三万六千美金售出，回国退休去了。第一辆一九四六年式克莱斯拉轿车到上海后，由一个好心肠的美国商人以三千元美金卖了出去，得了颇大的一笔进款，可是他现在却觉得自己简直是一个傻瓜，因为最近别人已经以二万四千美金，第二次转卖出去了。
    中央政府把从日本人手上接收过来的纺织工厂改成国营，因而垄断了整个的纺织市场；政府的贷款，使一个私人企业公司统治了整个的上海黑市米价。政府同时还以“暂时”停止输入美国新卡车，封锁中国的卡车市场，政府想要抛出一万五千辆卡车。这些卡车，原来都是为了滇缅路和雷多公路用的，每一加仑只能很不经济的跑四英里路。
    ……孙科立法院院长邀请行政院院长宋子文，在这星期出席立法院的例会，并答复一些对于经济困难方面的问题，但是宋子文并没有露面，后来孙科派那被人尊重的国民党经济学家马寅初先生（他在战争中曾因为批评中央政府而受监禁）到上海去，继续攻击“官僚资本”，马先生在那些半官半私的机关面前，如中国银行研究所、农业经济研究所等，谈到政府集中资金与利用公款做私人的商品，或金条囤积等问题，这事在今天中国来说，已经从可耻的行为变为正常的了。上海的中国报纸在星期五报导，说警察已禁止马先生按照预定计划做下次演说。
    只许有一个好政府
    怎样才可以改变这一切？而且美国的地位应该怎样？我们在中国的地位，无可否认的是和我们在全世界的军事据点联结起来，而且由于和苏联关系的逐渐恶化，更会不断的增加，也许由于这一事实，给予国民党死硬派以信心，这些人沾沾自喜的自问：由于苏联与中国共产党之间思想上的联系，美国人有什么办法呢，除了继续支持中央政府。他们认为因为我们的军事战略据点把我们和中央政府联系在一起了，不管我们喜欢不喜欢他们的态度和经济政策。
    另一方面，在国民党的自由主义圈子之内，又在讨论着另外一种建议。……国民党现在有足够的兵力保护他自己，但是他不能永久把盖子压在四万万不幸的人民头上，如果美国并不能促成一个自由主义的革命，那么最好还是退出去，对于中国共产党不见得可以用任何方法来停止他们的革命道路，除非有一个好政府。
    目前这个政府已经在自私地而且是完全不仁地消耗美国的供给和金钱。一个外国运输人员告诉美国朋友这样一个故事，他曾经做过政府的代理人，收购大硫璜岛美国剩余的医药品，在这些物品转交政府一星期之后，已经变为某一个上海堆栈中的私人货物，在等待着黑市的营利了。
    唯一的希望
    中国目前的政府既没有得到和平，也没有得到经济福利……解决的办法，就在于来一个内部的大清除……改良后的政府，必须给人民一个公正的好政府以及和平，这是我们所能看到的唯一的长期的希望。
                                      （延安新华社，周译。）
